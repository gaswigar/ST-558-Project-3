the
rebel
of
the
school
chapter
i
sent
to
coventry
the
school
was
situated
in
the
suburbs
of
the
popular
town
of
merrifield
and
was
known
as
the
great
shirley
school
it
had
been
endowed
some
hundred
years
ago
by
a
rich
and
eccentric
individual
who
bore
the
name
of
charles
shirley
but
was
now
managed
by
a
board
of
governors
by
the
express
order
of
the
founder
the
governors
were
women
and
very
admirably
did
they
fulfil
their
trust
there
was
no
recent
improvement
in
education
no
better
methods
no
sanitary
requirements
which
were
not
introduced
into
the
great
shirley
school
the
number
of
pupils
was
limited
to
four
hundred
one
hundred
of
which
were
foundationers
and
were
not
required
to
pay
any
fees
the
remaining
three
hundred
paid
small
fees
in
order
to
be
allowed
to
secure
an
admirable
and
education
under
the
auspices
of
the
great
school
there
came
a
day
in
early
autumn
shortly
after
the
girls
had
reassembled
after
their
summer
vacation
when
they
streamed
out
of
the
building
in
groups
of
twenties
and
thirties
and
forties
they
stood
about
and
talked
as
girls
will
the
great
shirley
school
well
as
it
was
managed
had
perhaps
a
larger
share
than
many
schools
of
those
temptations
which
make
school
a
world
a
world
for
the
training
either
for
good
or
evil
of
those
who
go
to
it
there
were
the
girls
who
attended
the
school
in
the
ordinary
way
and
there
were
the
girls
who
were
drafted
on
to
the
foundation
from
lower
schools
these
latter
were
looked
down
upon
by
the
least
noble
and
the
meanest
of
their
there
was
a
slight
rain
falling
and
two
or
three
girls
standing
in
a
group
raised
their
umbrellas
but
they
still
stood
beside
the
gates
she
quite
the
very
prettiest
girl
i
ever
saw
cried
alice
tennant
but
of
course
we
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
she
entered
a
week
ago
she
does
pay
any
of
the
fees
she
has
no
pretence
to
being
a
lady
oh
here
she
comes
did
you
ever
see
such
a
face
a
slight
shabbily
dressed
little
girl
with
her
satchel
of
books
slung
on
her
arm
now
appeared
she
looked
to
right
and
left
of
her
as
though
she
were
slightly
alarmed
her
face
was
beautiful
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
world
it
did
not
at
all
match
with
the
shabby
faded
clothes
which
she
wore
she
had
large
eyes
hair
and
a
sweet
fresh
complexion
her
expression
was
bewitching
and
when
she
smiled
a
dimple
came
in
her
cheek
look
look
cried
mary
denny
is
she
all
that
i
have
said
yes
and
more
what
a
pity
we
ca
know
her
said
alice
tennant
but
ca
we
i
really
do
see
why
we
should
make
the
poor
child
miserable
said
mary
denny
it
is
not
to
be
thought
of
we
must
worship
the
beautiful
new
star
from
afar
perhaps
she
will
do
something
to
raise
herself
into
our
set
but
as
it
is
she
must
go
with
kate
rourke
and
hannah
johnson
and
clara
sawyer
and
all
the
rest
of
the
foundationers
well
we
have
seen
her
now
said
mary
so
i
suppose
we
need
stand
talking
about
her
any
longer
will
you
come
home
and
have
tea
with
me
alice
mother
said
i
might
ask
you
i
wish
i
could
come
said
alice
but
we
are
expecting
kathleen
oh
the
irish
girl
is
it
really
arranged
that
she
is
to
come
yes
of
course
it
is
she
comes
i
have
never
seen
her
we
are
all
pleased
and
expect
that
she
will
be
a
very
great
acquisition
irish
girls
always
are
said
mary
they
so
gay
and
full
of
life
and
are
so
ridiculously
witty
do
you
remember
that
time
when
we
had
norah
mahoney
at
the
school
what
fun
that
was
but
she
got
into
terrible
scrapes
and
was
practically
dismissed
said
alice
i
only
hope
kathleen
wo
be
in
that
style
but
do
you
know
anything
about
her
the
irish
are
always
so
terribly
poor
she
is
not
poor
at
all
she
has
got
an
uncle
and
aunt
in
chicago
and
they
are
as
rich
as
can
be
and
her
uncle
is
coming
to
see
her
at
christmas
and
besides
that
her
father
has
an
awfully
old
castle
in
the
of
ireland
he
is
never
troubled
on
account
of
the
land
league
or
anything
else
and
kathleen
will
have
lots
and
lots
of
money
i
know
she
is
paying
mother
well
for
giving
her
a
home
while
she
is
being
educated
at
the
shirley
school
i
ca
imagine
why
she
comes
to
our
school
if
she
is
so
rich
said
mary
it
seems
almost
unfair
the
great
shirley
school
is
not
meant
for
rich
girls
a
girl
of
the
kind
you
have
just
described
ought
not
to
become
a
member
of
the
school
oh
that
is
all
very
fine
but
it
seems
her
mother
was
educated
here
and
swore
a
sort
of
vow
that
when
kathleen
was
old
enough
she
should
come
to
this
school
and
to
no
other
her
mother
name
is
and
she
wrote
to
miss
ravenscroft
and
asked
if
there
was
a
vacancy
for
kathleen
and
if
she
knew
of
any
one
who
would
be
nice
to
her
and
with
whom
she
could
live
miss
ravenscroft
thought
of
mother
she
knew
that
mother
would
like
to
have
a
boarder
who
would
pay
her
well
so
the
whole
thing
was
settled
mother
has
been
corresponding
with
and
kathleen
comes
i
really
ca
stay
another
moment
mary
i
must
rush
home
there
are
no
end
of
things
to
be
attended
to
all
right
said
mary
i
will
watch
for
you
and
the
beautiful
irish
heiress
i
do
know
that
she
is
an
heiress
well
whatever
she
is
the
bewitching
irish
girl
morning
for
the
present
mary
turned
to
the
left
and
alice
continued
her
walk
she
walked
quickly
she
was
a
rather
pretty
girl
of
fifteen
her
hair
very
light
in
colour
hung
down
her
back
she
had
a
determined
walk
and
a
good
carriage
as
she
hurried
her
steps
she
saw
ruth
craven
the
pretty
foundation
girl
walking
in
front
of
her
ruth
walked
slowly
and
as
if
she
were
tired
once
she
pressed
her
hand
to
her
side
and
alice
passing
her
hesitated
and
looked
back
the
face
that
met
hers
was
so
appealing
and
loving
that
she
could
not
resist
saying
a
word
are
you
awfully
tired
ruth
craven
she
said
i
shall
get
used
to
it
replied
ruth
i
have
had
a
cold
for
the
last
few
days
thank
you
so
much
miss
tennant
do
thank
me
said
alice
frowning
and
do
say
tennant
it
is
good
form
in
our
school
i
hope
you
will
be
better
i
am
sure
at
least
that
you
will
like
the
school
very
much
thank
you
said
the
girl
again
the
girls
parted
at
the
next
corner
when
ruth
found
herself
alone
she
paused
and
looked
behind
her
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
she
took
out
her
handkerchief
to
wipe
them
away
she
paused
as
if
troubled
by
some
thought
then
her
face
grew
bright
and
she
stepped
along
more
briskly
i
am
a
coward
and
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
she
thought
now
when
i
go
in
and
grandfather
sees
me
he
will
think
he
has
done
quite
wrong
to
let
me
go
to
the
shirley
school
i
must
not
let
him
think
that
and
granny
will
be
still
more
vexed
i
have
had
my
heart
desire
and
because
things
are
not
quite
so
pleasant
as
i
hoped
they
would
have
been
it
is
no
reason
why
i
should
be
discontented
the
next
moment
she
had
lifted
the
latch
at
a
small
cottage
and
entered
it
was
a
little
better
than
a
workman
house
but
not
much
there
were
two
rooms
downstairs
and
two
rooms
upstairs
and
that
was
all
to
the
front
of
the
little
house
was
the
tiny
parlour
at
the
back
an
equally
tiny
kitchen
upstairs
was
a
bedroom
for
ruth
and
a
bedroom
for
her
grandparents
and
craven
did
not
keep
any
servants
the
moment
ruth
entered
now
her
grandmother
put
her
head
out
of
the
kitchen
door
ruthie
she
said
the
butcher
has
disappointed
us
here
is
a
shilling
go
to
the
shop
and
bring
in
some
sausages
be
as
quick
as
you
can
child
or
your
grandfather
wo
have
his
supper
in
time
ruth
took
the
money
without
a
word
she
went
down
a
small
lane
turned
to
her
right
and
found
herself
in
a
mean
little
street
full
of
small
shops
she
entered
one
that
she
knew
and
asked
for
a
pound
and
a
half
of
pork
sausages
as
the
woman
was
wrapping
them
up
in
a
piece
of
torn
newspaper
she
looked
at
ruth
and
said
is
it
true
miss
craven
that
you
are
a
scholar
at
the
great
shirley
school
i
am
replied
ruth
i
went
there
for
the
first
time
so
your
grandparents
are
going
to
educate
you
miss
as
if
you
were
a
lady
i
am
a
lady
plowden
my
grandparents
can
not
make
me
anything
but
what
i
am
plowden
smiled
she
handed
ruth
her
sausages
without
a
word
and
the
young
girl
left
the
shop
her
grandmother
was
waiting
for
her
in
the
porch
what
a
time
you
have
been
child
she
said
i
do
hope
this
new
school
and
the
scholars
and
all
this
fuss
and
excitement
of
your
new
life
turn
your
head
whatever
happens
you
have
got
to
be
a
little
servant
to
me
and
a
little
messenger
to
your
grandfather
you
have
got
to
make
yourself
useful
and
not
to
have
ideas
beyond
your
station
here
are
the
sausages
granny
answered
ruth
in
a
gentle
tone
the
old
lady
took
them
from
her
and
disappeared
into
the
kitchen
ruth
ruth
said
a
somewhat
querulous
but
very
deep
voice
which
evidently
issued
from
the
parlor
yes
granddad
coming
in
a
moment
or
two
ruth
replied
she
ran
up
the
tiny
stairs
and
entered
her
own
little
bedroom
which
was
so
wee
that
she
could
scarcely
turn
round
in
it
but
was
extremely
neat
ruth
removed
her
hat
brushed
out
her
black
hair
saw
that
her
dress
shabby
as
it
was
was
in
order
put
on
a
neat
white
apron
and
ran
downstairs
she
first
of
all
entered
the
parlor
a
handsome
old
man
with
a
decided
look
of
ruth
herself
was
seated
by
the
fire
he
was
holding
out
his
thin
knuckly
hands
to
the
blaze
as
ruth
came
in
he
turned
and
smiled
at
her
ah
deary
he
said
i
have
been
missing
you
all
day
and
how
did
you
like
your
school
and
how
is
everything
i
will
tell
you
after
supper
grandfather
i
must
go
and
help
granny
now
that
right
that
a
good
girl
oh
far
be
it
from
me
to
be
impatient
i
would
be
for
all
the
world
your
granny
has
missed
you
too
ruth
smiled
at
him
and
went
into
the
kitchen
there
were
eager
voices
and
sounds
of
people
hurrying
about
and
then
a
fragrant
smell
of
fried
sausages
a
moment
later
ruth
appeared
holding
a
brightly
trimmed
lamp
in
her
hand
she
laid
it
on
a
little
drew
down
the
blinds
pulled
the
red
curtains
across
the
windows
poked
up
the
fire
and
then
proceeded
to
lay
the
cloth
for
supper
her
pile
of
books
which
she
had
brought
in
her
satchel
lay
on
a
chair
i
can
have
a
look
at
your
books
while
i
am
waiting
ca
i
little
woman
said
the
old
man
ruth
brought
him
over
the
pack
of
books
somewhat
unwillingly
he
gave
a
sigh
of
contentment
drew
the
lamp
a
little
nearer
and
was
lost
for
the
time
being
now
child
said
old
craven
you
heat
that
plate
by
the
fire
have
you
got
the
pepper
and
salt
handy
sausages
ai
worth
touching
unless
you
eat
them
piping
hot
your
grandfather
wants
his
beer
dear
dear
what
a
worry
that
is
i
never
knew
that
the
cask
was
empty
what
is
to
be
done
i
can
go
round
to
the
shop
and
bring
in
a
quart
said
ruth
but
you
a
member
of
the
shirley
school
no
you
must
i
do
it
nonsense
granny
i
leave
school
if
you
do
let
me
work
for
you
just
the
same
as
ever
craven
sank
into
her
chair
you
are
a
good
child
she
said
all
day
i
have
been
so
fretting
that
we
were
taking
you
out
of
your
station
and
that
is
a
sad
mistake
sad
and
terrible
but
you
are
a
good
child
yes
go
for
it
dear
it
do
you
any
harm
ruth
wrapped
an
old
shawl
round
her
head
picked
up
a
jug
and
went
off
to
the
nearest
they
were
accustomed
to
see
her
there
for
old
craven
more
often
than
not
had
his
little
cask
of
beer
empty
she
went
to
a
side
entrance
where
a
woman
she
knew
served
her
with
what
she
required
there
ruth
craven
she
said
there
it
is
but
all
the
same
surprised
to
see
you
here
but
why
so
asked
ruth
is
it
true
that
you
are
one
of
the
shirley
scholars
now
i
am
i
joined
the
school
and
yet
you
come
to
fetch
beer
for
your
old
grandfather
i
do
said
ruth
with
spirit
and
i
shall
fetch
it
for
him
as
long
as
he
wants
it
thank
you
very
much
she
took
the
jug
and
walked
carefully
back
to
the
cottage
she
the
handsomest
most
spirited
best
little
thing
i
ever
met
thought
the
landlady
of
the
lion
and
she
began
to
consider
in
her
own
mind
if
one
of
her
men
could
not
call
round
in
the
morning
and
leave
the
necessary
beer
at
the
cravens
supper
was
served
and
was
eaten
with
considerable
relish
by
all
three
now
said
old
granny
when
the
meal
had
come
to
an
end
you
stay
and
talk
to
your
grandfather
he
is
all
agog
to
hear
what
you
have
got
to
say
and
i
will
wash
up
now
then
child
do
you

who
has
got
loving
grandparents
like
us
and
it
is
many
old
bodies

got

a
dear
little
granddaughter
said
the
old
man
smiling
at
ruth
craven
carried
the
supper
things
into
the
kitchen
and
ruth
sat
close
to
her
grandfather

me

said

did
they
do

class

the
third

very
good
class

least

do
understand
your
modern
names
but

me
what

got
to
learn

all
its
branches

am
determined
to
take
up
latin
i
want
to
get
to
the
heart
of
things
quite
right
quite
right
too
and
you
are
ever
so
pleased
at
having
got
in
it
does
seem
a
grand
thing
for
me
does
it
grandfather
most
of
the
girls
are
ladies
are
they
it
is
a
big
school
between
three
and
four
hundred
girls
i
suppose
they
are
all
ladies
well
you
are
anyhow
my
little
ruth
am
i
granddad
that
is
the
question
what
do
you
think
yourself
i
think
so
but
what
does
the
world
say
ruth
i
never
told
you
but
your
mother
was
a
lady
you
know
what
your
father
was
i
saved
and
stinted
and
toiled
and
got
him
a
commission
in
the
army
he
died
poor
fellow
shortly
after
you
were
born
but
he
was
a
commissioned
officer
in
the
punjab
infantry
your
mother
was
a
governess
but
she
was
a
lady
by
birth
her
father
was
a
clergyman
your
parents
met
in
india
they
fell
in
love
and
married
your
mother
died
at
your
birth
and
you
came
home
to
us
yes
child
by
birth
you
are
a
lady
as
good
as
any
of
them
as
good
as
the
best
they
are
dead
said
ruth
i
do
remember
them
i
have
a
picture
of
my
father
upstairs
it
is
taken
with
his
uniform
on
he
looks
very
handsome
and
i
have
a
little
sketch
of
my
mother
and
she
looks
fair
and
sweet
and
interesting
but
i
never
knew
them
those
i
knew
and
know
and
love
are
you
grandfather
and
granny
well
dear
when
i
had
the
power
and
the
brains
and
the
strength
i
kept
a
shop
a
grocer
shop
dear
and
my
wife
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
your
grandparents
were
both
in
trade
there
no
way
out
of
it
but
a
gentleman
and
lady
for
all
that
said
the
girl
she
pressed
close
to
the
old
man
took
one
of
his
hands
between
both
of
her
own
and
stroked
it
that
is
as
people
think
ruthie
but
we
were
in
the
position
and
never
expect
to
be
of
those
who
are
high
up
in
the
world
i
am
glad
you
told
me
about
my
father
and
mother
said
the
girl
i
love
both
their
memories
i
am
glad
to
think
that
my
father
served
the
queen
and
that
my
mother
was
the
daughter
of
a
clergyman
but
i
am
more
glad
to
think
that
there
never
was
such
an
honorable
man
as
you
granddad
and
that
you
made
the
grocery
trade
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
it
was
a
bad
trade
my
darling
i
had
several
severe
losses
it
was
very
unfortunate
my
lending
that
money
what
money
oh
i
will
tell
you
another
time
it
does
really
matter
there
was
a
little
bit
of
ingratitude
there
but
it
does
matter
only
i
made
no
fortune
by
grocery
barely
enough
to
put
my
boy
into
the
army
and
to
educate
him
for
it
and
enough
to
keep
us
with
a
pittance
now
that
we
are
old
but
i
have
nothing
to
leave
you
sweetest
you
just
have
your
pension
from
the
government
which
do
count
for
nothing
at
all
ruth
rose
to
her
feet
i
am
glad
i
got
into
the
school
she
said
i
hope
to
do
wonders
there
i
mean
to
take
every
scrap
of
good
the
place
opens
out
to
me
i
mean
to
work
as
hard
as
ever
i
can
you
shall
be
desperately
proud
of
me
and
so
shall
granny
although
she
does
hold
with
much
learning
but
i
do
little
girl
i
love
it
more
than
anything
i
have
got
such
a
lovely
scheme
in
my
head
i
will
work
alongside
of
you
ruth
you
and
i
at
the
same
things
you
can
lend
me
the
books
when
you
do
want
them
what
a
splendid
idea
said
ruth
clapping
her
hands
you
look
quite
happy
my
dear
and
so
i
am
i
am
about
the
happiest
girl
on
earth
and
now
may
i
begin
to
look
through
my
lessons
for
the
old
man
arranged
the
lamp
where
its
light
would
be
most
comfortable
for
the
keen
young
eyes
and
ruth
sat
down
to
the
table
got
out
her
books
and
worked
for
an
hour
or
two
craven
came
in
looked
at
her
proudly
wagged
her
head
and
returned
to
the
kitchen
after
a
time
she
came
to
the
door
and
beckoned
to
the
old
man
to
follow
her
but
the
old
man
had
taken
up
one
of
ruth
books
and
was
absorbed
in
its
contents
he
was
muttering
words
over
under
his
breath
coming
wife
coming
presently
he
said
ruth
head
was
bent
over
her
books
craven
rose
and
went
on
tiptoe
into
the
kitchen
we
must
disturb
her
susan
he
said
we
must
let
her
have
her
own
way
she
must
work
just
as
long
as
she
likes
she
is
going
to
be
a
great
power
in
the
land
is
that
child
with
her
beauty
and
her
talent
there
nothing
she
ca
aspire
to
now
do
you
be
a
silly
old
man
said
craven
and
what
on
earth
were
you
whispering
about
to
yourself
when
i
came
in
i
am
going
to
work
with
her
it
will
be
a
wonderful
stimulation
and
a
great
interest
to
me
i
always
was
keen
for
craven
suppressed
a
sigh
if
i
even
had
fifty
pounds
she
said
i
would
let
that
child
spend
every
hour
at
school
i
dress
up
smart
and
take
her
out
and
get
her
the
very
best
husband
i
could
why
old
man
what
does
a
woman
want
with
all
that
learning
if
a
woman
has
brains
she
bound
to
use
them
replied
the
old
man
as
he
sat
down
by
the
kitchen
fire
meanwhile
ruth
went
on
with
her
lessons
after
a
time
however
she
uttered
a
sigh
she
flung
down
her
books
and
looked
across
the
room
if
he
only
knew
she
said
under
her
breath
if
he
only
knew
that
i
was
practically
sent
to
coventry
that
none
of
the
nice
girls
will
speak
to
me
but
never
mind
i
wo
tell
him
nothing
would
induce
me
to
trouble
him
on
the
subject
chapter
ii
high
life
and
low
life
amongst
the
many
girls
who
attended
the
great
shirley
school
was
one
who
was
known
by
the
name
of
cassandra
weldon
she
was
rapidly
approaching
the
proud
position
of
head
girl
in
the
school
she
had
entered
the
shirley
school
when
quite
a
little
child
had
gone
steadily
up
through
the
different
classes
and
the
various
removes
until
she
found
herself
nearly
at
the
head
of
the
sixth
form
she
was
about
to
try
for
a
scholarship
renewable
for
three
years
if
she
got
it
she
would
go
to
holloway
college
and
eventually
support
herself
and
her
mother
weldon
was
the
widow
of
a
man
who
in
his
time
had
a
very
successful
school
for
boys
and
she
herself
had
been
a
teacher
long
ago
in
the
great
shirley
school
cassandra
and
her
mother
therefore
were
from
the
very
first
surrounded
by
scholarship
they
belonged
so
to
speak
to
the
scholastic
world
weldon
could
scarcely
talk
of
anything
else
evening
after
evening
she
would
question
her
daughter
eagerly
with
regard
to
this
accomplishment
and
the
other
to
this
change
or
that
to
this
chance
which
cassandra
might
have
and
to
the
other
the
girl
was
extremely
clever
with
a
sort
of
talent
which
was
most
remarkable
for
in
addition
to
many
excellent
accomplishments
she
was
distinctly
musical
her
musical
talent
very
nearly
amounted
to
genius
if
in
the
future
she
could
not
play
in
public
she
resolved
at
least
to
earn
her
living
as
a
music
teacher
weldon
hoped
that
cassandra
would
do
more
than
this
and
to
tell
the
truth
the
girl
shared
her
dreams
besides
music
she
had
worked
very
hard
at
botany
at
french
and
german
and
at
english
literature
she
would
be
seventeen
on
her
next
birthday
and
it
was
against
the
rules
for
any
girl
to
remain
at
the
great
shirley
school
after
that
time
cassandra
had
however
two
more
terms
of
before
her
and
these
terms
she
regarded
as
the
most
valuable
of
her
whole
education
in
appearance
cassandra
was
a
tall
girl
graceful
in
her
movements
and
very
in
manner
her
face
was
full
of
intelligence
but
was
rather
plain
than
otherwise
for
her
mouth
was
too
wide
and
her
nose
the
reverse
of
classical
she
had
bright
intelligent
brown
eyes
however
a
nice
voice
and
a
pleasant
way
cassandra
was
looked
up
to
by
all
her
and
this
not
because
she
was
rich
nor
because
she
was
beautiful
but
simply
because
she
was
good
and
honorable
and
trustworthy
she
possessed
a
large
amount
of
sympathy
for
nearly
every
one
her
tact
was
unfailing
and
she
was
never
now
cassandra
who
had
many
friends
in
the
school
had
amongst
them
of
course
her
greatest
friend
this
girl
was
called
florence
archer
florence
was
pretty
and
clever
but
she
had
neither
cassandra
depth
nor
power
of
intellect
she
was
naturally
vain
and
frivolous
except
in
the
presence
of
her
dearest
friend
she
was
easily
influenced
by
others
and
it
was
her
habit
to
follow
the
one
who
gave
her
the
last
advice
her
passionate
love
for
cassandra
was
perhaps
her
best
and
strongest
quality
but
of
late
she
had
exhibited
a
sense
of
almost
unwarrantable
jealousy
when
any
other
girl
showed
a
preference
for
her
special
friend
florence
was
a
very
nice
girl
but
jealousy
was
her
bane
she
thought
a
good
deal
of
herself
for
her
father
was
a
rich
man
and
only
took
advantage
of
the
great
shirley
education
because
it
was
incomparably
the
best
in
the
place
there
was
no
rule
against
any
one
attending
the
school
and
he
had
long
ago
secured
a
niche
in
it
for
his
favorite
daughter
florence
loved
it
and
hated
it
at
the
same
time
she
was
fond
of
her
own
companions
but
she
could
not
bear
the
foundation
girls
these
girls
made
a
large
percentage
in
the
school
in
all
respects
they
were
supposed
to
be
florence
equals
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
kept
in
a
very
subordinate
position
by
the
paying
girls
on
every
possible
occasion
they
were
avoided
and
there
must
be
something
very
special
about
any
one
of
them
if
she
was
taken
up
by
the
aristocrats
as
they
termed
themselves
of
the
school
but
cassandra
as
a
rule
was
perfectly
sweet
and
pleasant
to
the
foundation
girls
and
this
trait
in
her
friend
character
annoyed
florence
more
than
anything
else
on
the
morning
after
ruth
craven
had
been
admitted
to
the
school
cassandra
was
one
of
the
first
arrivals
she
was
standing
in
the
wide
courtyard
waiting
for
the
school
doors
to
be
opened
she
looked
as
usual
bright
and
capable
a
stream
of
girls
were
surrounding
her
each
smiling
and
trying
to
draw
her
attention
cassandra
was
a
girl
of
few
words
and
after
nodding
to
her
companions
she
gave
them
to
understand
that
she
did
not
intend
to
enter
into
any
special
conversation
her
neat
satchel
of
was
slung
on
her
arm
she
wore
a
very
serge
dress
and
her
white
looked
correct
and
pretty
on
her
shining
brown
hair
cassandra
with
her
face
beaming
as
the
sun
made
a
sort
of
for
the
smaller
girls
presently
three
foundation
girls
entered
the
gates
side
by
side
and
glanced
up
at
her
this
trio
formed
perhaps
the
most
objectionable
set
in
the
school
one
was
called
kate
rourke
she
was
a
girl
of
fifteen
years
of
age
showily
dressed
with
flashing
eyes
long
earrings
in
her
ears
false
jewellery
round
her
neck
and
a
smart
rather
shabby
hat
trimmed
with
a
lot
of
flowers
placed
at
the
back
of
her
head
hanging
on
kate
arm
might
have
been
seen
hannah
johnson
in
all
respects
that
young
lady
double
clara
sawyer
a
little
girl
about
fourteen
with
a
heavy
fringe
right
down
to
her
eyebrows
completed
the
trio
they
glanced
at
cassandra
and
then
nodded
to
one
another
and
joked
and
laughed
i
have
no
doubt
said
kate
that
cassie
will
take
her
up
she
said
the
word
cassie
in
a
loud
voice
cassandra
heard
her
but
she
took
not
the
slightest
notice
she
is
safe
to
continued
kate
now
such
a
girl
ought
to
be
on
the
foundation
at
all
if
you
only
knew
the
snubbing
she
gave
me
yesterday
i
quite
hate
her
with
all
her
pretty
face
and
her
mincing
ways
never
mind
kitty
said
hannah
johnson
she
may
snub
you
as
much
as
she
likes
but
you
have
got
me
to
cling
on
to
and
you
got
me
too
kitty
said
clara
sawyer
she
snuggled
close
up
to
kate
and
slipped
her
hand
through
her
arm
nasty
thing
said
hannah
i
feel
every
word
you
say
kate
do
you
know
i
offered
to
walk
home
with
her
yesterday
and
she
said
i
thank
you
i
prefer
to
walk
home
alone
as
hannah
made
this
speech
she
adopted
the
mincing
tones
which
she
supposed
ruth
craven
had
used
the
two
other
girls
burst
out
laughing
oh
do
say
what
you
are
laughing
about
said
another
girl
running
up
to
the
group
at
this
moment
her
name
was
rosy
myers
you
always
have
a
joke
among
you
three
and
i
want
to
share
it
do
say
do
say
i
got
a
lot
of
toffee
in
my
pocket
hand
it
out
rosy
and
perhaps
we
tell
you
said
kate
rose
produced
a
packet
of
sticky
sweetmeat
and
a
moment
later
the
four
were
sucking
peppermint
toffee
and
making
themselves
thoroughly
objectionable
to
their
neighbors
but
what
about
the
girl
the
person
you
are
laughing
about
asked
rose
oh
it
that
stupid
tiresome
ruth
craven
answered
hannah
why
she
nobody
the
governors
and
the
mistress
ought
not
to
allow
such
a
girl
in
the
school
it
all
very
well
to
be
on
the
foundation
but
there
are
limits
why
her
old
grandfather
kept
nothing
better
than
a
huckster
shop
it
does
seem
right
that
a
girl
of
that
sort
should
belong
to
this
school
and
then
take
airs
but
the
question
is
said
cassandra
suddenly
does
she
take
airs
the
girls
all
stopped
talking
and
gazed
up
at
cassandra
with
astonishment
in
their
faces
i
have
overheard
you
said
miss
weldon
calmly
i
presume
you
are
alluding
to
miss
craven
we
are
talking
about
ruth
craven
said
kate
rourke
and
you
will
excuse
me
cassie
but
i
never
saw
a
girl
more
of
pride
she
is
so
conceited
that
she
is
intolerable
i
heard
of
her
yesterday
but
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
form
any
estimate
of
her
character
continued
cassandra
i
should
prefer
that
you
did
not
call
me
cassie
if
you
please
kate
i
will
watch
her
and
find
out
if
i
agree
with
you
i
only
noticed
yesterday
that
she
is
remarkably
pretty
i
will
ask
her
to
walk
home
with
me
and
have
tea
i
should
like
to
introduce
her
to
mother
well
i
never
said
hannah
and
you
really
mean
that
you
would
introduce
that
girl
to
mrs
weldon
i
think
so
yes
i
am
almost
certain
here
she
comes
i
like
her
face
do
let
her
hear
you
giggling
please
kate
it
is
very
unkind
to
make
a
new
girl
feel
uncomfortable
kate
smothered
a
laugh
and
turned
away
the
doors
of
the
school
were
now
thrown
open
and
the
girls
disappeared
by
their
special
entrances
it
was
just
at
that
moment
that
ruth
in
her
shabby
dress
but
with
her
sweet
and
most
beautiful
face
joined
the
group
of
girls
who
were
going
into
the
school
she
was
without
a
companion
the
other
girls
went
in
by
twos
each
clinging
to
her
special
crony
cassandra
now
changed
her
position
and
found
herself
within
a
yard
or
two
of
ruth
craven
she
was
examining
ruth
with
great
care
but
not
at
all
from
the
unkind
point
of
view
hers
was
a
sympathetic
aspect
that
little
old
serge
dress
made
something
come
up
in
cassandra
throat
and
she
longed
beyond
words
to
give
her
a
better
dress
ruth
hat
too
left
much
to
be
desired
it
was
an
old
black
which
had
been
burnt
to
a
dull
brown
but
notwithstanding
the
hat
and
the
dress
there
was
the
face
the
face
was
most
lovely
and
the
back
of
the
shabby
frock
was
covered
by
hair
as
black
as
jet
and
curling
and
rippling
in
the
sunshine
what
would
every
other
girl
in
the
school
give
to
have
such
a
face
as
that
and
such
hair
as
that
thought
cassandra
i
must
speak
to
her
she
was
just
bending
forward
meaning
to
touch
ruth
on
her
shoulder
when
there
came
a
commotion
near
the
entrance
and
the
excited
face
of
alice
tennant
came
into
view
alice
was
accompanied
by
a
tall
showily
dressed
girl
the
girl
had
a
very
vivid
color
in
her
cheeks
intensely
bright
and
roguish
eyes
light
chestnut
hair
touched
with
gold
hair
which
was
a
mass
of
waves
and
tendrils
and
fluffiness
and
on
which
a
little
velvet
cap
was
placed
i
am
not
going
to
be
shy
cried
the
in
a
hearty
clear
loud
voice
with
a
considerable
amount
of
brogue
in
it
leave
off
clutching
me
by
the
arm
alice
my
honey
for
see
my
new
companions
i
will
ah
what
a
crowd
of
girls
colleens
we
call
them
in
ireland
oh
glory
how
am
i
ever
to
get
the
names
of
half
of
them
round
my
tongue
ah
and
is
that
one
a
beauty
hush
kathleen
do
hush
said
alice
they
will
hear
you
and
what
do
i
care
if
they
do
darling
it
does
matter
to
me
i
mean
to
talk
to
that
girl
she
won
my
heart
entirely
before
alice
could
prevent
her
the
irish
girl
had
sprung
forward
pushed
a
couple
of
great
shirley
girls
out
of
their
places
and
had
taken
ruth
craven
by
the
arm
it
a
kiss
i
going
to
give
you
my
beauty
she
said
oh
right
glad
i
am
to
see
you
my
name
is
kathleen
and
i
hail
from
the
ould
country
ah
though
it
lonely
i
likely
to
be
is
it
deary
you
do
deny
me
the
pleasure
of
your
society
when
i
tell
you
that
in
all
this
vast
crowd
i
stand
solitary
solitary
but
for
her
and
bedad
i
not
certain
that
i
take
to
her
at
all
let
me
tuck
my
hand
inside
your
arm
sweetest
a
titter
was
heard
from
the
surrounding
girls
ruth
turned
very
red
then
she
looked
into
kathleen
eyes
you
mean
kindly
she
said
but
perhaps
you
had
better
not
you
too
are
a
stranger
are
you
a
stranger
asked
kathleen
then
that
clinches
the
matter
ah
yes
it
lonely
i
am
i
have
come
from
my
dear
mountain
home
to
be
civilised
but
civilisation
will
never
suit
kathleen
she
meant
to
have
it
she
meant
to
dance
on
the
tops
of
the
mountains
and
to
gather
flowers
in
the
bogs
she
made
to
dance
and
joke
and
laugh
and
to
have
a
gay
time
ah
my
people
at
home
made
a
fine
mistake
when
they
sent
me
to
be
civilised
but
i
like
you
honey
i
like
the
shape
of
your
face
and
the
way
you
are
made
and
the
wonderful
look
in
your
eyes
when
you
glance
round
at
me
it
is
you
and
me
will
be
the
finest
of
friends
we
before
ruth
could
reply
the
girls
had
entered
the
great
hall
which
presently
became
quite
full
do
let
go
of
me
darling
for
the
life
of
you
it
lost
i
be
in
a
place
of
this
sort
let
me
clutch
on
to
you
until
they
put
me
into
the
lowest
place
in
the
school
but
why
so
asked
ruth
glancing
at
her
tall
companion
in
some
astonishment
do
you
know
anything
i
never
a
bit
darling
i
do
suppose
they
keep
me
here
i
have
no
learning
and
i
never
want
to
have
any
and
what
more
hush
girls
no
talking
called
the
indignant
voice
of
a
mistress
kathleen
eyes
grew
round
with
laughter
she
suddenly
dropped
a
curtsy
mum
the
word
she
said
and
then
she
glanced
round
at
her
numerous
companions
the
girls
had
all
been
watching
her
their
faces
broke
into
smiles
the
smiles
became
titters
and
the
titters
roars
the
mistress
had
again
to
come
forward
and
ask
what
was
wrong
it
only
me
miss
said
kathleen
so
do
blame
any
of
the
other
innocent
lambs
i
fresh
from
old
ireland
oh
miss
it
a
beautiful
country
were
you
never
there
if
you
could
only
behold
her
purple
mountains
and
let
yourself
go
on
the
bosom
of
her
rushing
streams
were
you
ever
in
the
old
country
miss
if
i
might
venture
to
ask
a
civil
question
no
said
miss
atherton
in
a
very
suppressing
tone
i
do
understand
impertinent
questions
and
i
expect
the
schoolgirls
to
be
ah
ruth
craven
will
you
take
this
young
lady
under
your
wing
did
i
say
we
were
to
be
mates
dear
said
kathleen
and
as
they
passed
from
the
great
hall
kathleen
hand
was
still
fondly
linked
on
ruth
arm
chapter
iii
the
wild
irish
girl
lessons
went
on
in
their
usual
orderly
fashion
at
eleven
there
was
a
break
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
girls
streamed
into
the
playground
the
playground
was
very
large
and
was
asphalted
and
in
consequence
quite
dry
and
pleasant
to
walk
on
there
was
a
field
just
beyond
and
into
this
field
the
girls
now
strolled
by
twos
and
twos
kathleen
clung
to
ruth
craven
arm
she
kept
talking
to
her
and
asking
her
questions
you
need
reply
unless
you
like
pet
she
said
all
i
want
is
just
to
look
into
your
face
i
adore
beauty
i
worship
it
more
than
anything
else
on
earth
i
was
brought
up
in
the
midst
of
it
i
never
saw
anything
uglier
than
poor
old
towser
when
he
broke
his
leg
and
cut
his
upper
jaw
but
although
he
was
ugly
he
was
the
darling
of
my
heart
he
died
and
i
cried
a
lot
i
ca
quite
get
over
it
yes
i
suppose
i
am
uncivilised
and
i
never
want
to
be
anything
else
do
you
think
i
want
to
copy
those
girls
over
there
or
that
lot
or
that
you
had
better
not
point
please
miss
said
ruth
they
like
it
what
do
i
care
whether
they
like
it
or
not
said
kathleen
i
brought
here
to
curry
favor
with
them
what
would
my
darling
father
say
if
i
told
him
that
i
was
going
to
curry
favor
with
the
girls
of
the
great
shirley
school
and
what
would
mother
say
no
no
i
may
pick
up
a
few
smatterings
or
i
may
not
but
there
is
one
thing
certain
i
mean
to
make
a
friend
of
you
ruth
yes
a
great
big
bosom
friend
you
will
be
fond
of
me
wo
you
i
like
you
now
said
ruth
i
know
you
are
kind
and
you
are
very
pretty
why
then
darling
said
kathleen
is
it
the
blarney
stone
you
have
kissed
you
have
a
sweet
little
voice
of
your
own
although
it
the
dear
touch
of
the
brogue
that
i
miss
so
in
all
the
other
girls
but
you
like
miss
tennant
do
you
said
ruth
oh
yes
poor
little
alice
she
very
reserved
and
very
very
formal
but
she
a
good
soul
and
i
wo
worry
her
but
you
are
the
one
my
heart
has
gone
out
to
ah
that
is
the
way
of
irish
hearts
they
go
straight
out
to
their
kindred
spirits
you
are
a
kindred
spirit
of
mine
ruth
craven
and
you
ca
get
away
from
me
not
even
if
you
will
the
fifteen
minutes
for
recreation
came
to
an
end
and
the
girls
returned
to
the
schoolroom
ruth
was
in
a
high
class
for
her
age
and
was
already
absorbed
in
her
work
kathleen
drummed
with
her
fingers
on
her
desk
and
looked
round
her
kathleen
was
in
a
low
class
she
was
with
girls
a
great
deal
smaller
and
younger
than
herself
how
old
are
you
miss
the
english
teacher
miss
dove
had
said
i
am
fifteen
bless
your
heart
darling
replied
kathleen
do
talk
exactly
like
that
said
miss
dove
who
in
spite
of
herself
was
attracted
by
the
sweet
voice
and
sweeter
eyes
say
am
fifteen
miss
dove
kathleen
made
a
grimace
her
grimace
was
so
comical
that
all
the
small
girls
in
the
class
burst
out
laughing
she
was
silent
speak
dear
said
miss
dove
in
a
persuasive
tone
yes
darling
i
trying
to
you
must
use
affectionate
words
in
school
oh
my
heart
how
am
i
to
bear
it
said
kathleen
and
she
clasped
a
white
hand
over
that
organ
miss
dove
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
decided
that
she
would
let
the
question
in
dispute
go
by
for
the
present
she
began
to
question
kathleen
as
to
her
acquirements
and
found
that
she
must
leave
her
with
the
younger
children
for
the
time
being
she
then
went
on
to
attend
to
other
duties
kathleen
sat
in
the
centre
of
the
class
it
seemed
absurd
to
see
this
tall
girl
surrounded
by
tiny
tots
one
of
the
tiny
tots
looked
towards
her
presently
she
thrust
out
a
moist
little
hand
and
out
of
the
moisture
produced
a
peppermint
drop
just
for
a
second
kathleen
bright
eyes
fell
upon
the
sweetmeat
with
disgust
then
she
took
it
up
gingerly
and
popped
it
into
her
mouth
it
golloptious
she
said
turning
to
the
child
and
then
she
drummed
her
fingers
once
more
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
presently
she
stooped
down
and
whispered
to
this
small
girl
i
hate
school
do
you
y
es
was
the
timid
reply
let
go
out
but
i
i
ca
i
must
then
i
have
nothing
to
do
the
lessons
are
deadly
stupid
forgive
me
girls
you
are
all
blameless
and
the
next
moment
she
had
left
the
room
half
a
moment
later
she
was
in
the
fresh
air
outside
her
cheeks
were
hot
her
hair
in
disorder
and
her
hand
where
she
had
touched
the
peppermint
was
sticky
what
would
father
say
if
he
could
see
me
now
she
thought
if
aunty
was
to
look
at
her
kathleen
oh
why
did
they
send
me
across
the
cold
sea
to
a
place
of
this
sort
a
detestable
place
oh
the
fresh
air
is
reviving
i
was
born
free
and
britons
never
never
will
be
slaves
i
ca
stay
in
that
horrid
room
oh
how
long
the
morning
is
just
then
a
teacher
came
out
and
beckoned
to
kathleen
what
are
you
doing
outside
miss
come
in
immediately
and
return
to
your
class
i
ca
dear
replied
kathleen
in
a
gentle
tone
you
are
young
are
you
you
do
look
more
than
twenty
do
you
ever
feel
your
heart
beat
wild
dear
and
your
spirits
all
in
a
sort
of
throb
and
did
you
when
you
were
like
that
submit
to
being
tied
up
in
steel
chains
all
round
every
bit
of
you
answer
me
did
you
i
ca
answer
you
miss
you
are
a
very
naughty
rebellious
girl
you
have
come
to
school
to
be
disciplined
go
back
immediately
for
a
minute
kathleen
thought
of
rebelling
but
then
she
said
to
herself
it
is
worth
the
fuss
and
returned
to
her
place
once
again
in
the
centre
of
the
class
i
have
been
called
back
she
said
in
a
whisper
to
her
little
peppermint
companion
i
was
naughty
to
go
out
and
i
am
called
back
i
am
in
disgrace
is
it
a
lark
the
little
girl
felt
quite
excited
never
was
there
such
and
big
and
fascinating
inmate
of
the
lower
fifth
before
it
was
worth
coming
to
school
now
to
be
in
the
vicinity
of
one
so
handsome
and
so
gay
the
weary
morning
came
to
an
end
at
last
the
girls
seldom
returned
for
afternoon
school
generally
doing
their
preparations
at
home
alice
tennant
however
sometimes
preferred
the
quiet
school
to
the
noisy
life
she
lived
with
her
brothers
at
home
she
looked
now
eagerly
for
kathleen
who
had
shunned
her
from
the
instant
they
had
entered
the
school
she
stood
just
by
the
gate
waiting
for
her
kathleen
on
her
part
was
looking
for
ruth
craven
ruth
had
been
monopolised
by
cassandra
weldon
you
must
come
home
with
me
she
said
but
my
grandparents
will
be
expecting
me
said
ruth
never
mind
we
will
go
round
by
your
cottage
and
ask
them
i
know
all
about
you
and
i
want
to
know
you
better
you
will
wo
you
thank
you
very
much
said
ruth
we
will
go
on
at
once
without
waiting
for
the
others
said
cassandra
and
they
walked
on
quickly
while
kathleen
searched
in
vain
for
her
chosen
friend
come
kathleen
i
am
waiting
said
alice
in
a
slightly
cross
voice
mother
said
we
were
to
be
home
early
all
right
said
kathleen
but
i
ca
find
miss
craven
anywhere
you
ca
wait
for
her
now
indeed
she
has
gone
i
saw
her
walking
down
the
road
with
cassandra
weldon
and
who
is
she
the
head
girl
of
the
school
and
such
a
splendid
creature
i
am
glad
she
is
taking
up
ruth
it
is
possible
for
every
one
to
notice
her
although
for
my
part
i
have
no
patience
with
that
sort
of
false
pride
of
course
a
lot
of
the
foundation
girls
are
very
common
but
when
one
sees
a
perfect
lady
like
ruth
one
ought
to
recognize
her
of
course
said
kathleen
fidgeting
a
little
as
she
walked
and
how
did
you
get
on
asked
alice
noticing
the
dejected
tone
of
her
voice
i
got
on
abominably
said
kathleen
what
class
are
you
in
i
do
know
i
am
with
a
lot
of
babies
i
suppose
i
am
to
be
a
sort
of
caretaker
to
them
there
was
anything
to
learn
i
am
going
to
write
to
father
i
ca
stay
in
that
horrid
school
oh
yes
you
can
you
will
get
to
like
it
very
much
after
a
time
you
have
never
been
at
school
before
and
of
course
you
find
it
irksome
is
it
irksome
cried
kathleen
is
it
that
she
calls
it
oh
glory
it
purgatory
my
dear
that
what
it
is
purgatory
and
i
done
anything
to
deserve
it
but
you
want
to
learn
you
do
want
to
be
always
ignorant
bedad
then
darling
i
do
want
to
learn
at
all
what
do
i
want
to
know
your
sort
of
things
for
i
could
beat
you
every
one
of
you
and
the
teachers
too
in
some
accomplishments
put
me
on
a
horse
darling
and
see
what
i
can
do
and
put
me
in
a
boat
pet
and
find
out
where
i
can
take
you
and
set
me
swimming
in
the
cold
sea
i
can
turn
somersaults
and
dive
and
dance
on
the
waves
and
do
every
mortal
thing
as
though
i
were
a
fish
not
a
girl
and
give
me
a
gun
and
see
me
bring
down
a
bird
on
the
wing
ah
those
things
ought
to
be
counted
in
the
education
of
a
woman
i
can
do
all
those
things
and
i
can
mix
whisky
punch
and
i
can
sing
songs
to
the
dear
old
dad
and
i
can
comfort
my
mother
when
her
rheumatics
are
bad
and
i
can
love
love
love
oh
no
alice
i
am
not
ignorant
in
the
true
sense
but
i
hate
french
and
i
hate
arithmetic
and
i
hate
all
your
horrid
school
work
and
i
never
could
spell
properly
and
what
does
it
matter
everything
replied
alice
you
ca
go
about
the
world
if
you
are
stupid
and
ignorant
ca
i
exclaimed
kathleen
and
she
flashed
her
eyes
at
alice
and
made
her
feel
as
she
said
afterwards
quite
uncanny
the
tennants
were
after
all
not
a
large
family
they
consisted
of
tennant
alice
and
two
young
brothers
these
brothers
were
schoolboys
of
the
unruly
type
alice
considered
them
very
badly
trained
kathleen
however
was
much
taken
by
their
schoolboyish
ways
as
the
two
girls
now
entered
the
house
they
heard
a
whistle
proceeding
from
the
attic
a
at
the
same
time
came
from
the
basement
oh
dear
cried
alice
there
are
those
dreadful
boys
again
whatever
you
do
kathleen
you
must
not
encourage
them
in
their
larks
but
why
should
i
i
like
them
both
i
call
david
a
broth
of
a
boy
i
am
glad
you
have
got
brothers
alice
i
have
any
but
then
i
have
lots
of
boy
cousins
which
comes
to
much
the
same
thing
the
girls
by
this
time
had
reached
the
large
bedroom
which
they
shared
on
the
first
floor
you
are
welcome
to
my
brothers
if
you
do
toss
all
your
things
about
in
my
room
cried
alice
if
we
are
to
sleep
together
we
must
be
orderly
orderly
is
it
cried
kathleen
i
do
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
well
all
right
i
ready
she
pushed
her
fingers
through
her
tangled
golden
hair
and
without
glancing
at
herself
in
the
glass
marched
out
of
the
room
i
wish
mother
had
asked
her
to
come
said
alice
to
herself
the
house
was
bad
enough
before
but
now
she
will
make
things
past
bearing
alice
went
downstairs
to
the
sound
of
a
cracked
gong
the
tennants
had
their
meals
in
a
on
the
second
floor
it
was
barely
furnished
and
had
kamptulicon
instead
of
a
carpet
on
the
floor
tennant
looking
careworn
and
anxious
was
seated
at
the
head
of
the
table
her
dress
was
somewhat
faded
alice
entered
and
took
her
seat
at
the
foot
kathleen
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
have
only
soup
and
fish
for
dinner
said
tennant
i
do
trust
kathleen
will
be
satisfied
alice
frowned
at
her
mother
in
some
displeasure
we
ought
to
have
meat
she
was
beginning
when
there
came
a
bang
and
a
scuffle
a
girlish
laugh
and
kathleen
leaning
fondly
on
both
the
boys
appeared
tennant
pointed
to
a
seat
and
she
sat
down
the
irish
girl
had
a
healthy
appetite
and
was
indifferent
to
what
she
ate
she
demanded
two
plates
of
soup
and
when
she
had
finished
the
second
she
looked
at
tennant
and
said
emphatically
i
have
fallen
in
love
my
dear
kathleen
i
have
with
a
girl
so
it
does
matter
she
the
prettiest
sweetest
bonniest
thing
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
i
am
going
to
hunt
round
for
her
immediately
after
dinner
i
thought
i
say
so
for
i
mean
to
do
it
oh
kathleen
said
alice
in
a
distressed
voice
you
really
must
you
must
come
back
to
the
school
with
me
i
promised
miss
dove
that
see
you
through
your
you
know
mother
continued
alice
kathleen
is
not
very
advanced
for
her
age
and
miss
dove
wants
to
get
her
into
a
proper
class
as
quickly
as
possible
therefore
she
is
to
be
coached
a
little
and
i
have
undertaken
to
do
you
will
come
with
me
kathleen
i
must
get
back
to
the
school
again
by
two
you
will
be
sure
to
come
dear
i
think
not
dear
replied
kathleen
in
her
most
aggravating
tone
but
you
must
she
mother
you
ought
to
kathleen
said
tennant
you
have
been
sent
here
to
learn
alice
can
teach
you
she
can
help
you
very
much
she
means
to
be
very
kind
to
you
you
certainly
ought
to
do
what
she
suggests
but
i
am
afraid
said
kathleen
that
i
am
not
going
to
do
what
i
ought
i
do
wish
to
be
good
at
all
i
could
live
if
i
was
really
naughty
sometimes
i
mean
to
be
terribly
naughty
all
the
afternoon
if
you
will
let
me
have
my
fling
i
do
assure
you
tennant
that
i
will
work
off
the
steam
and
will
be
all
right
i
must
do
something
desperate
and
if
alice
opposes
me
have
to
do
something
worse
you
are
a
clipper
said
david
tennant
smiling
into
her
face
all
right
my
boy
i
expect
i
am
said
kathleen
and
then
she
added
springing
to
her
feet
i
have
eaten
enough
and
for
what
we
have
received
tennant
i
off
chapter
iv
the
and
the
rebellious
kathleen
ran
up
to
an
untidy
room
she
the
door
and
standing
by
it
for
a
moment
drew
the
bolt
thus
she
had
secured
herself
against
intrusion
she
then
flung
herself
on
the
bed
put
her
two
arms
under
her
head
and
gazed
out
of
the
window
her
heart
was
beating
wildly
she
had
a
strange
medley
of
feelings
within
she
was
desperately
madly
lonely
she
was
homesick
in
the
most
intense
sense
of
the
word
kathleen
had
never
left
carrigrohane
castle
before
this
romantic
abode
was
situated
in
the
extreme
of
ireland
it
was
a
mile
away
from
the
sea
and
stood
on
a
rocky
eminence
which
overlooked
a
very
wide
expanse
of
moor
and
wood
rushing
streams
and
purple
mountains
and
deep
sea
in
the
whole
world
there
could
scarcely
be
found
a
more
lovely
view
than
that
which
since
her
birth
had
presented
itself
before
kathleen
young
eyes
her
father
squire
was
as
landlords
in
ireland
go
very
well
off
his
tenantry
adored
him
he
got
in
his
rents
with
tolerable
regularity
he
was
a
good
landlord
firm
but
also
kind
and
indulgent
a
real
case
of
distress
was
never
turned
away
from
his
doors
but
where
rent
could
be
paid
he
insisted
on
the
cottars
giving
him
his
due
he
kept
a
rather
wild
establishment
however
his
wife
was
an
irishwoman
from
a
neighboring
county
and
had
some
of
the
most
careless
attributes
of
her
race
the
house
got
along
anyhow
there
were
always
shoals
of
visitors
mostly
relatives
there
were
heavy
feasts
in
the
old
hall
and
sittings
up
very
late
at
night
and
no
end
of
hunting
and
fishing
and
shooting
in
their
seasons
in
the
summer
a
pretty
white
yacht
made
a
great
divartisement
as
the
squire
was
fond
of
saying
and
in
all
things
kathleen
was
free
as
the
air
she
breathed
she
was
educated
in
a
sort
of
fashion
by
an
irish
governess
but
in
reality
she
was
allowed
to
pursue
her
lessons
exactly
as
she
liked
best
herself
it
was
just
before
she
was
fifteen
that
kathleen
aunt
a
maiden
lady
from
dublin
who
rejoiced
in
the
truly
irish
name
of
came
to
see
them
remarked
on
kathleen
wild
unkempt
appearance
declared
that
the
girl
would
be
a
downright
beauty
when
she
was
eighteen
said
that
no
one
would
tolerate
such
a
want
of
knowledge
in
the
present
day
and
advised
that
she
should
go
to
school
took
miss
hint
very
much
to
heart
kathleen
was
consulted
and
of
course
tabooed
the
entire
scheme
in
the
end
however
the
elder
ladies
carried
the
day
miss
took
her
niece
to
dublin
with
her
and
gave
her
an
expensive
and
very
unnecessary
wardrobe
and
having
heard
a
great
deal
of
tennant
who
had
irish
relatives
decided
that
kathleen
should
go
to
the
great
shirley
school
where
she
herself
had
been
educated
long
ago
everything
was
arranged
in
a
great
hurry
it
seemed
to
kathleen
now
as
she
lay
on
her
bed
kicking
her
feet
impatiently
and
ruffled
her
beautiful
hair
that
the
thing
had
come
to
pass
in
a
flash
it
seemed
only
yesterday
that
she
was
at
home
in
the
old
house
petted
by
the
servants
adored
by
her
father
worshipped
by
all
her
relatives
the
young
queen
of
the
castle
free
as
the
air
followed
by
her
dogs
riding
on
her
pony
and
now
she
was
here
in
this
hideous
poor
house
going
to
that
ugly
school
i
ca
stand
it
she
thought
there
only
one
way
out
i
must
have
a
real
desperate
burst
of
naughtiness
what
shall
i
do
that
will
most
aggravate
them
for
do
that
thing
i
will
and
as
quickly
as
possible
kathleen
thought
rapidly
she
had
no
brothers
of
her
own
but
their
loss
was
made
up
for
by
the
adoration
of
about
twenty
young
cousins
who
were
always
loafing
about
the
place
and
following
kathleen
wherever
she
turned
what
would
most
aggravate
pat
if
he
were
here
thought
the
girl
or
dear
old
michael
ah
well
michael
the
girl
face
slightly
changed
i
was
never
naughty
with
michael
she
said
to
herself
he
is
different
from
the
others
i
would
like
to
see
that
sort
of
sorry
look
in
his
dear
eyes
oh
i
must
think
of
michael
now
when
i
was
going
away
he
said
you
come
back
a
princess
and
i
be
proud
to
see
you
no
i
must
think
of
michael
pat
the
imp
would
help
me
and
so
would
rory
and
so
would
ted
but
what
shall
it
be
she
thought
excitedly
there
came
a
rattle
at
the
handle
of
the
door
let
me
in
please
kathleen
let
me
in
called
alice
voice
presently
darling
replied
kathleen
in
her
most
nonchalant
tone
but
i
am
in
a
hurry
i
must
be
back
at
school
by
two
let
me
in
immediately
what
a
nuisance
it
all
is
thought
kathleen
but
after
all
my
naughtiness
need
make
that
stupid
old
alice
late
for
her
darling
lessons
she
scrambled
off
the
bed
drew
back
the
bolt
and
returned
to
her
old
position
alice
came
quickly
in
she
glanced
at
kathleen
with
disgust
i
wish
you
would
lie
on
the
bed
in
your
muddy
boots
no
answer
i
must
ask
you
not
to
lock
the
door
it
is
my
room
as
well
as
yours
no
answer
kathleen
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
window
they
were
brimful
of
mischief
after
a
time
she
said
darling
i
wish
you
would
talk
to
me
in
that
silly
way
faith
honey
then
i
do
wish
kathleen
suddenly
sprang
upright
on
her
bed
do
you
like
the
sky
when
it
looks
as
it
does
now
i
wish
you
could
see
it
from
carrigrohane
you
do
know
the
sort
of
expression
it
has
when
it
seems
to
be
kissing
the
sea
we
have
a
ghost
at
carrigrohane
oh
wisha
then
if
you
only
could
see
it
i
can
tell
the
boys
about
it
i
make
them
creep
it
is
very
silly
to
talk
about
ghosts
nobody
believes
in
them
said
alice
i
ask
father
if
i
may
have
you
at
carrigrohane
in
the
summer
and
then
see
if
you
do
believe
she
wears
white
i
am
going
out
now
kathleen
are
you
coming
with
me
no
thank
you
my
love
you
ought
to
kathleen
i
am
busy
preparing
for
my
scholarship
examination
or
i
would
stay
and
argue
with
you
it
is
an
awful
pity
to
have
gone
to
the
expense
of
coming
here
if
you
do
mean
to
do
your
utmost
thank
you
darling
but
it
is
rather
a
waste
of
breath
for
you
to
talk
so
long
to
me
i
mean
to
be
naughty
this
afternoon
i
ca
help
you
said
alice
i
am
very
sorry
you
ever
came
thank
you
so
much
dear
alice
ran
downstairs
mother
she
said
rushing
into
her
mother
presence
we
shall
have
no
end
of
trouble
with
that
terrible
girl
she
is
lying
now
on
the
bed
with
her
outdoor
boots
on
and
she
wo
come
to
school
or
do
a
single
thing
i
want
her
to
the
money
her
father
pays
will
be
very
welcome
alice
we
must
bear
with
some
discomforts
on
account
of
that
i
suppose
so
said
alice
shrugging
her
shoulders
how
horrid
it
is
to
be
poor
and
to
have
such
a
girl
as
that
in
the
house
well
i
stay
another
minute
you
had
better
keep
a
sort
of
general
eye
on
her
mother
for
there
no
saying
what
she
will
do
she
has
declared
her
intention
of
being
naughty
she
knows
no
fear
is
not
guided
by
any
sort
of
principle
and
would
in
short
do
anything
well
go
to
school
alice
and
be
quick
home
for
i
have
a
great
deal
i
want
you
to
help
me
with
alice
made
no
reply
and
tennant
after
thinking
for
a
minute
went
upstairs
she
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
room
which
she
had
given
up
to
the
two
girls
there
was
no
answer
she
opened
it
and
went
in
the
bird
had
flown
there
were
evident
signs
of
a
stampede
through
the
window
for
it
stood
wide
open
and
there
were
marks
of
not
too
clean
boots
on
the
drugget
and
a
torn
piece
of
ivy
just
without
the
window
was
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
and
kathleen
must
have
let
herself
down
by
the
sturdy
arm
of
the
old
ivy
tennant
looked
out
half
expecting
to
see
a
mangled
body
on
the
ground
but
there
was
no
one
in
view
she
returned
to
her
darning
and
her
anxious
thoughts
she
was
a
widow
with
two
sons
and
a
daughter
and
something
under
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
on
which
to
live
to
educate
the
boys
to
do
something
for
alice
and
to
put
into
all
their
mouths
was
a
difficult
problem
to
solve
in
these
expensive
days
she
had
on
purpose
moved
close
to
the
great
shirley
school
in
order
to
avail
herself
of
its
cheap
education
for
alice
the
boys
went
to
another
foundation
school
near
by
and
altogether
the
family
managed
to
scrape
along
but
the
advent
of
kathleen
on
the
scene
was
a
great
relief
for
her
father
paid
three
guineas
a
week
for
tennant
motherly
care
and
for
kathleen
board
and
lodging
poor
child
thought
the
good
woman
what
a
wild
undisciplined
handsome
creature
she
is
i
must
do
what
i
can
for
her
she
sat
on
for
some
time
darning
and
thinking
her
heart
was
full
she
felt
depressed
she
had
been
working
in
various
ways
ever
since
six
that
morning
and
the
darning
of
the
boys
rough
socks
hurt
her
eyes
and
made
her
fingers
ache
meanwhile
kathleen
was
running
along
the
road
she
ran
until
she
was
completely
out
of
breath
she
then
came
to
a
stile
against
which
she
leant
she
saw
a
girl
walking
leisurely
up
the
road
she
was
a
shabbily
dressed
and
rather
vulgar
girl
kathleen
saw
at
once
that
she
was
one
of
the
great
shirley
girls
so
she
went
forward
and
spoke
to
her
you
go
to
our
school
do
you
she
said
yes
miss
answered
the
girl
dropping
a
little
curtsy
when
she
saw
kathleen
she
was
a
very
fresh
foundation
girl
and
recognized
something
in
kathleen
which
caused
her
to
be
more
subservient
than
was
necessary
then
if
you
please
continued
kathleen
can
you
tell
me
where
that
sweetly
pretty
girl
ruth
craven
lives
she
is
a
lady
said
the
girl
whose
name
was
susan
hopkins
she
is
no
more
a
lady
than
i
am
indeed
she
is
said
kathleen
she
is
a
great
deal
more
of
a
lady
than
you
are
the
girl
flushed
you
are
a
great
shirley
girl
yourself
she
said
i
saw
you
there
you
are
in
an
awfully
low
class
do
you
like
sitting
with
the
little
kids
i
saw
you
towering
up
in
the
middle
of
them
like
a
mountain
kathleen
eyes
flashed
what

the
contrary

very
rich

you
ever
hear
of
a
girl
who
lived
in
a
castle
a
great
beautiful
castle
on
the
top
of
a
high
hill
if
you
ever
did
i
am
that
girl
oh
my
said
susy
hopkins
that
does
sound
romantic
her
momentary
dislike
to
kathleen
had
vanished
the
desire
to
go
to
the
town
on
a
message
for
her
mother
had
completely
left
her
she
stood
still
as
though
fascinated
i
live
there
said
kathleen
that

when
i
am
at
home
i
come
from
the
land

and
the
stream

shamrock
of
the
deep
deep
blue
sea
ireland

the
girl
i
am
proud
to
say
that
i
am

of

i
am
wicked
quite
wicked
i
could

one
who

me
i
want
some
one

that
person

handsome
you

susy
hopkins
then
i

that
dear
little
girl
who
is
so
beautiful
that
i
love
her
and
ca
get
her
out
of
my
head
i
want
to
find
ruth
craven
she
went
away
with
a
horrid
stiff
pokery
girl
called
cassandra
weldon
you
have
such
strange
names
in
your
country
that
horrid
prim
cassandra
chose
to
correct
me
when
i
came
into
school
and
she
has
taken
my
darling
away
the
only
one
i
love
in
the
whole
of
england
i
want
to
find
her
i
will
give
you
i
will
give
you
an
irish
diamond
set
in
a
brooch
if
you
will
help
me
this
sounded
a
very
grand
offer
indeed
to
susy
hopkins
who
lived
in
the
most
modest
way
and
had
not
a
jewel
of
any
sort
in
her
possession
i
will
help
you
i
will
and
i
can
i
know
where
miss
weldon
lives
i
can
take
you
to
her
house
but
i
want
ruth
if
she
has
taken
ruth
home
she
will
be
at
cassandra
house
said
susy
and
you
can
take
me
there
this
blessed
minute
all
right
come
along
when
will
you
give
me
the
diamond
set
in
the
brooch
it
is
a
real
diamond
you
know
it
is
an
irish
diamond
set
in
silver
real
silver
my
old
nurse
had
it
made
for
me
and
i
wear
it
sometimes
i
will
bring
it
to
you
to
school
oh
thank
you
thank
you
miss
i
forgot
your
name
kathleen
is
rather
a
difficult
name
to
say
may
i
call
you
kathleen
just
as
you
please
susan
it
is
more
handy
for
me
to
say
susan
than
hopkins
as
long
as
i
am
in
england
i
must
consort
i
see
with
all
kinds
of
people
and
if
you
will
make
yourself
useful
to
me
i
will
be
good
to
you
susy
turned
and
led
the
way
in
the
direction
of
cassandra
weldon
home
they
had
to
walk
across
a
very
wide
field
then
down
a
narrow
lane
then
up
a
steep
hill
and
then
into
a
valley
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
was
a
straight
road
and
at
each
side
of
the
road
were
neat
little
houses
small
and
very
each
house
consisted
of
two
stories
with
a
hall
door
in
the
middle
and
a
sitting
room
on
each
side
there
were
three
windows
overhead
and
one
or
two
attics
in
the
roof
the
houses
were
very
compact
they
were
new
and
were
called
by
ambitious
names
for
instance
the
house
where
the
weldons
lived
went
by
the
ambitious
name
of
sans
souci
all
through
the
walk
susy
chatted
for
the
benefit
of
her
companion
she
told
kathleen
so
much
about
her
life
that
she
was
interested
in
spite
of
herself
and
by
the
time
they
arrived
outside
sans
souci
kathleen
hand
was
lying
affectionately
on
her
companion
arm
i
had
best
not
go
in
miss
she
said
cassandra
weldon
would
never
take
the
very
least
notice
of
me
and
none
of
us
foundation
girls
like
her
at
all
well
it
is
extremely
unfair
said
kathleen
from
all
you
have
been
telling
me
the
foundation
girls
must
be
particularly
clever
i
tell
you
what
it
is
i
think
i
shall
take
to
you
oh
would
you
indeed
miss
said
susy
her
eyes
sparkling
there
are
a
hundred
of
us
you
know
in
the
school
that
is
a
great
number
and
ruth
craven
is
really
one
she
is
miss
she
is
a
bit
better
than
the
rest
of
us
and
i
love
her
already
she
is
no
better
than
the
rest
of
us
repeated
susan
hopkins
i
have
a
great
mind
to
take
to
you
all
to
make
a
fuss
about
you
and
to
show
the
others
how
badly
they
behave
you
be
a
queen
amongst
us
there
no
doubt
about
that
it
would
be
lovely
and
it
would
be
a
tremendous
bit
of
naughtiness
thought
kathleen
do
you
think
you
will
miss
because
if
you
do
i
will
tell
the
others
we
could
meet
you
and
talk
over
things
well
i
will
decide
i
will
enclose
a
letter
with
your
brooch
now
i
must
go
in
and
kiss
my
darling
ruth
susy
hopkins
stood
for
a
minute
to
watch
kathleen
as
she
went
up
the
little
narrow
path
of
sans
souci
when
kathleen
reached
the
porch
she
waved
her
hand
and
susy
putting
wings
to
her
feet
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
in
the
opposite
direction
she
felt
very
much
elated
and
really
pleased
in
the
whole
course
of
her
life
she
had
never
met
a
girl
of
the
kathleen
type
before
her
beauty
her
daring
and
wild
manner
the
flash
in
her
bright
dark
eyes
the
glints
of
gold
in
her
lovely
hair
all
fascinated
susy
what
a
queen
she
make
she
thought
we
must
make
her
our
queen
we
have
quite
a
party
of
our
own
in
the
school
if
she
took
us
up
and
she
will
i
sure
she
will
this
is
a
lark
this
is
worth
a
great
deal
meanwhile
kathleen
rang
the
bell
at
sans
souci
in
a
very
smart
imperative
manner
a
little
maid
neatly
dressed
came
to
the
door
please
said
kathleen
will
you
say
that
miss
has
called
and
would
be
glad
to
see
miss
ruth
craven
for
a
few
minutes
the
girl
withdrew
presently
she
returned
weldon
will
be
pleased
if
you
will
go
in
miss
she
is
sitting
in
the
the
two
young
ladies
are
out
in
the
garden
thank
you
said
kathleen
after
a
brief
hesitation
she
entered
the
house
and
was
conducted
across
the
narrow
hall
into
a
very
sweet
and
charmingly
furnished
room
the
room
had
a
with
french
doors
these
opened
on
to
a
little
at
one
side
of
the
house
was
a
tiny
conservatory
full
of
bright
flowers
compared
to
the
house
where
the
tennants
lived
this
tiny
place
looked
like
a
paradise
to
kathleen
she
gave
a
quick
glance
round
her
then
came
up
to
weldon
i
am
one
of
the
new
girls
at
the
great
shirley
school
she
said
my
name
is
kathleen
i
am
irish
i
have
only
just
crossed
the
cold
sea
i
am
lonely
too
i
want
ruth
craven
may
i
sit
down
a
minute
while
your
servant
fetches
her
i
like
ruth
craven
she
is
very
pretty
she
she
is
the
sort
of
girl
that
you
take
a
fancy
to
when
lonely
and
far
from
home
may
i
sit
here
until
she
comes
of
course
my
dear
said
weldon
speaking
with
kindness
and
looking
with
eyes
full
of
interest
at
the
handsome
girl
i
quite
understand
your
being
lonely
i
was
very
lonely
indeed
when
i
came
home
from
india
and
left
my
dear
father
and
mother
behind
me
how
old
were
you
when
you
came
home
a
great
deal
younger
than
you
are
only
seven
years
old
but
that
is
a
long
time
ago
i
should
like
to
be
kind
to
you
miss
cassandra
has
been
telling
me
about
you
you
are
living
at
the
tennants
are
you
not
alice
tennant
and
cassandra
are
great
friends
but
i
do
like
either
of
them
said
kathleen
in
her
blunt
way
weldon
looked
a
little
startled
do
you
know
my
daughter
she
asked
she
is
much
too
interfering
and
she
is
frightfully
please
forgive
me
but
i
am
always
very
i
always
tell
the
truth
i
do
want
her
i
like
you
and
wish
that
i
lived
with
you
and
that
you
have
ruth
craven
instead
of
your
own
daughter
in
the
house
then
i
be
perfectly
happy
i
always
did
say
what
i
thought
will
you
forgive
me
i
will
dear
because
at
the
present
moment
you
do
know
my
girl
at
all
there
never
was
a
more
splendid
girl
in
all
the
world
but
she
requires
to
be
known
ah
here
she
comes
and
your
little
friend
miss
craven
with
her
ruth
looking
very
pretty
with
a
delicate
flush
on
each
cheek
now
entered
the
room
in
the
company
of
cassandra
kathleen
sprang
up
the
minute
she
saw
ruth
rushed
across
the
room
and
flung
one
arm
with
considerable
violence
round
her
neck
you
have
come
she
said
i
have
been
hunting
the
place
for
you
how
dared
you
go
away
and
hide
yourself
do
you
know
that
you
belong
to
me
the
moment
i
saw
you
i
knew
that
you
were
my
affinity
do
you
know
what
an
affinity
means
well
you
are
mine
we
were
twin
souls
before
birth
now
we
have
met
again
and
we
can
not
part
i
am
ever
so
happy
when
i
am
with
you
do
mind
those
others
let
them
stare
all
they
like
i
am
going
to
take
you
foundation
girls
up
i
have
made
up
my
mind
we
will
have
a
rollicking
good
time
a
splendid
time
we
will
be
as
naughty
as
we
like
and
we
will
let
the
others
see
what
we
are
made
of
it
will
be
war
to
the
knife
between
the
foundation
girls
and
the
good
proper
paying
girls
let
the
ladies
look
after
themselves
we
of
the
foundation
will
lead
our
own
life
and
be
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
are
you
glad
to
see
me
dear
sweet
pretty
ruth
do
you
know
for
yourself
that
you
are
my
affinity
my
chosen
friend
my
beloved
through
the
ages
we
have
been
one
and
now
we
have
met
in
the
flesh
i
think
said
cassandra
at
last
managing
to
get
herself
heard
that
you
have
said
enough
for
the
present
miss
ruth
craven
has
come
to
spend
the
day
with
me
i
know
that
you
are
an
irish
girl
and
you
must
be
lonely
i
shall
be
very
pleased
if
you
will
join
ruth
and
me
in
our
walk
we
are
going
for
a
walk
across
the
we
shall
be
in
to
tea
dear
mother
will
you
have
it
ready
for
us
not
later
than
five
and
i
am
sure
you
will
join
me
mother
darling
in
asking
miss
to
stay
too
but
miss
does
want
to
join
either
you
or
your
darling
said
kathleen
in
her
rudest
tone
it
is
ruth
i
want
i
have
come
here
for
her
she
must
return
with
me
at
once
but
i
ca
i
am
ever
so
sorry
miss
you
mean
that
you
wo
come
when
i
have
called
for
you
i
am
with
miss
weldon
at
present
be
sensible
dear
said
weldon
at
that
moment
you
do
quite
understand
our
manners
in
this
country
however
attached
we
may
be
to
a
person
we
do
enter
a
strange
house
and
snatch
that
person
out
of
it
it
is
our
way
and
i
do
think
you
will
forgive
me
for
saying
it
that
your
way
is
as
nice
as
ours
be
persuaded
dear
and
join
cassandra
and
ruth
and
have
a
happy
time
kathleen
face
had
turned
crimson
she
looked
from
weldon
to
cassandra
and
then
she
looked
at
ruth
suddenly
her
eyes
brimmed
up
with
tears
i
do
think
i
can
ever
change
my
way
she
said
i
am
sorry
if
i
am
rude
and
not
understood
perhaps
after
all
i
am
mistaken
about
ruth
perhaps
she
is
not
my
real
proper
affinity
i
am
a
very
unhappy
girl
i
wish
i
could
go
back
to
mother
and
to
my
dad
i
should
be
lonely
if
i
were
in
the
midst
of
the
mountains
and
if
i
could
see
the
streams
and
the
blue
sea
i
do
know
why
aunt
katie
sent
me
to
this
horrid
place
i
wish
i
was
back
in
the
old
country
they
do
talk
as
you
talk
in
the
old
country
and
they
do
look
as
you
look
if
you
put
your
heart
at
the
feet
of
a
body
in
old
ireland
that
body
does
kick
it
away
i
will
go
i
do
want
your
tea
i
do
want
anything
that
you
have
to
offer
me
i
do
like
any
of
you
i
am
sorry
if
you
think
me
rude
but
i
ca
help
myself
no
no
stay
stay
and
visit
with
me
and
tell
me
about
the
old
country
and
the
sea
and
the
mountains
said
weldon
but
kathleen
shook
her
head
fiercely
and
the
next
moment
left
the
room
poor
strange
little
girl
thought
the
good
woman
i
see
she
is
about
to
heap
unhappiness
on
herself
and
others
what
is
to
be
done
for
her
i
like
her
said
ruth
she
is
very
impulsive
but
she
is
oh
yes
said
cassandra
she
has
a
good
heart
of
course
but
i
foresee
that
she
is
up
to
all
sorts
of
mischief
she
does
understand
our
ways
why
did
she
leave
her
own
country
ruth
was
silent
she
looked
wistful
come
along
ruthie
we
will
be
late
i
have
no
end
of
schemes
in
my
head
i
mean
to
help
you
you
will
win
that
scholarship
ruth
smiled
presently
she
and
cassandra
were
crossing
the
common
in
the
interest
of
their
own
conversation
they
forgot
kathleen
when
that
young
lady
left
the
house
she
ran
back
to
the
tennants
i
will
write
to
dad
and
tell
him
that
i
ca
stay
she
thought
oh
dear
my
heart
is
in
my
mouth
i
shall
have
a
broken
heart
if
this
sort
of
thing
goes
on
she
entered
the
house
there
sat
tennant
with
a
great
basket
of
stockings
before
her
the
remains
of
a
tea
were
on
the
table
the
boys
had
disappeared
come
in
kathleen
called
tennant
and
have
your
tea
i
want
maria
to
clear
the
away
as
i
have
some
cutting
out
to
do
so
be
quick
dear
kathleen
entered
the
untidy
table
did
not
trouble
her
in
the
least
she
was
accustomed
to
things
of
that
sort
at
home
she
sat
down
helped
herself
to
a
thick
slice
of
and
ate
it
while
burning
thoughts
filled
her
mind
have
some
tea
you
have
touched
any
said
tennant
i
rather
have
cold
water
please
kathleen
replied
she
went
to
the
sideboard
filled
a
glass
and
drank
it
off
tennant
she
said
when
she
had
finished
what
possessed
you
to
live
in
england
you
had
all
the
world
to
choose
from
why
did
you
come
to
a
horrible
place
like
this
but
i
like
it
said
tennant
you
do
look
as
if
you
did
i
never
saw
such
a
poor
body
are
you
awfully
old
you
would
think
me
so
replied
tennant
with
a
smile
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
not
forty
yet
not
forty
said
kathleen
but
forty
an
awful
age
is
it
i
mean
you
want
crutches
when
you
are
forty
do
you
not
as
a
rule
my
dear
i
trust
when
i
am
forty
i
shall
not
want
a
crutch
i
shall
be
forty
in
two
years
and
that
by
some
people
is
considered
young
then
i
suppose
it
is
mending
those
horrid
stockings
that
makes
you
so
old
mending
stockings
does
help
to
keep
you
young
certainly
shall
i
help
you
i
used
to
cobble
for
old
nurse
when
i
was
at
home
but
i
should
like
you
to
cobble
these
oh
i
can
darn
you
know
then
do
kathleen
i
should
take
it
very
kindly
if
you
would
here
is
worsted
and
here
is
a
needle
will
you
sit
by
me
and
tell
me
about
your
home
kathleen
certainly
would
not
have
believed
her
own
ears
had
she
been
told
an
hour
ago
that
she
would
end
her
first
fit
of
desperate
naughtiness
by
darning
stockings
for
the
tennant
boys
she
did
not
darn
well
but
then
tennant
was
not
particular
she
certainly
although
she
said
she
would
not
did
cobble
these
stockings
to
an
extraordinary
extent
but
her
work
and
the
chat
with
tennant
did
her
good
and
she
went
upstairs
to
dress
for
supper
in
a
happier
frame
of
mind
i
will
stay
here
for
a
little
she
said
finally
to
tennant
because
i
think
it
will
help
you
you
look
so
terribly
tired
and
i
do
think
you
ought
to
have
this
horrible
work
to
do
i
like
to
do
it
for
you
but
i
do
suppose
i
shall
have
time
i
will
stay
for
a
bit
and
see
what
i
can
make
of
the
foundation
girls
the
foundation
girls
oh
yes
do
ask
me
to
explain
there
are
a
hundred
of
them
at
the
great
shirley
school
and
i
am
going
no
i
ca
explain
i
will
stop
here
instead
of
running
away
i
meant
to
run
away
when
my
affinity
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
really
kathleen
you
are
a
most
extraordinary
girl
of
course
i
am
said
kathleen
did
you
ever
suppose
that
i
was
anything
else
i
am
very
remarkable
and
i
am
very
naughty
i
always
was
and
i
always
will
be
i
am
up
to
no
end
of
mischief
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
me
and
rory
together
at
home
oh
what
did
we
do
do
you
know
that
once
we
walked
across
a
little
bridge
of
metal
which
is
put
between
two
of
the
stables
it
is
just
a
narrow
iron
rod
six
feet
in
length
if
we
had
either
of
us
fallen
we
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
forty
feet
below
mother
saw
me
when
i
was
across
and
she
gave
a
shriek
it
nearly
finished
me
but
i
steadied
myself
and
got
across
oh
it
was
jolly
i
am
going
to
set
some
of
the
foundation
girls
at
that
sort
of
thing
i
expect
i
shall
have
great
fun
with
them
it
is
principally
because
my
affinity
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
me
she
is
attaching
herself
to
another
and
that
other
is
little
better
than
a
monster
your
alice
wo
like
me
and
to
be
frank
with
you
i
do
like
her
i
like
you
because
you
are
poor
and
worried
and
seem
old
for
your
age
although
your
age
is
a
great
one
and
because
you
have
to
cobble
those
horrid
socks
there
for
the
present
do
hate
me
too
much
i
ca
help
the
way
i
am
made
oh
i
hear
alice
what
a
detestable
voice
she
has
now
then
i
off
kathleen
ran
up
to
her
room
and
again
she
locked
the
door
she
heard
alice
step
and
she
felt
a
certain
vindictiveness
as
she
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
alice
presently
took
the
handle
of
the
door
and
shook
it
let
me
in
at
once
kathleen
she
said
i
really
ca
put
up
with
this
sort
of
thing
any
longer
i
want
to
get
into
my
room
i
want
to
tidy
myself
i
am
going
to
supper
with
cassandra
weldon
then
you
do
get
in
whispered
kathleen
to
herself
aloud
she
said
i
am
sorry
darling
but
i
am
specially
busy
and
i
really
must
have
my
share
of
the
room
to
myself
do
open
the
door
kathleen
now
almost
pleaded
poor
alice
if
you
want
your
share
of
the
room
i
want
mine
do
you
understand
i
am
not
interfering
dearest
called
back
kathleen
and
i
am
keeping
religiously
to
my
own
half
i
have
the
straight
window
and
you
have
the
bay
i
am
not
touching
your
beautiful
half
i
am
only
in
mine
let
me
in
called
alice
again
and
do
be
silly
sorry
dear
do
think
i
am
silly
there
was
a
silence
alice
went
on
her
knees
and
peered
through
the
keyhole
kathleen
was
seated
by
her
and
there
was
a
sound
of
the
furious
scratching
of
a
pen
quite
audible
this
is
intolerable
thought
alice
she
is
the
most
awful
girl
i
ever
heard
of
i
shall
be
late
mary
addersley
and
rhoda
pierpont
are
to
call
for
me
shortly
and
i
sha
be
ready
i
do
want
to
appeal
to
mother
or
to
be
rude
to
the
poor
wild
thing
the
first
day
stay
i
will
tempt
kathleen
yes
darling
would
you
like
to
come
with
me
to
cassandra
weldon
she
is
so
nice
and
so
is
her
mother
she
plays
beautifully
and
they
will
sing
irish
songs
called
out
kathleen
i
do
know
perhaps
they
will
if
you
ask
them
thanks
replied
kathleen
i
am
not
going
again
there
was
silence
and
the
scratching
of
the
pen
continued
alice
was
now
obliged
to
go
downstairs
to
acquaint
her
mother
what
is
it
dear
why
my
dear
alice
how
excited
you
look
i
have
cause
to
be
mother
i
have
come
in
rather
late
very
much
fagged
out
from
a
day
of
hard
examination
work
and
that
imp
that
horrid
girl
has
locked
me
out
of
my
bedroom
i
was
so
looking
forward
to
a
nice
little
supper
with
cassandra
and
the
other
girls
kathleen
let
me
in
she
really
is
intolerable
i
ca
stay
in
the
room
with
her
any
longer
she
is
past
bearing
ca
you
give
me
an
attic
to
myself
at
the
top
of
the
house
you
know
i
have
a
corner
ca
i
share
your
bed
mummy
i
shall
be
so
miserable
with
that
dreadful
kathleen
you
know
quite
well
alice
that
that
is
the
only
really
good
bedroom
in
the
house
and
i
ca
afford
to
give
it
to
one
girl
by
herself
i
think
kathleen
will
be
all
right
when
we
really
get
to
know
her
but
she
is
very
undisciplined
still
three
guineas
a
week
makes
an
immense
difference
to
me
alice
i
ca
help
telling
you
so
my
child
in
my
opinion
it
is
hardly
earned
said
alice
i
suppose
i
must
stay
down
here
and
give
up
my
supper
i
ca
go
like
this
all
untidy
and
my
hair
so
messy
and
my
collar
oh
mother
it
is
nearly
black
it
is
really
too
trying
i
will
go
up
and
see
if
i
can
persuade
her
said
tennant
she
went
upstairs
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
spoke
the
moment
her
voice
penetrated
to
kathleen
ears
she
jumped
to
her
feet
crossed
the
room
and
bent
down
at
the
other
side
of
the
keyhole
do
tire
your
dear
voice
she
said
what
is
it
you
want
i
want
you
to
open
the
door
kathleen
poor
alice
wants
to
get
in
to
get
her
clothes
it
is
her
room
as
much
as
yours
let
her
in
at
once
my
dear
i
am
very
sorry
darling
tennant
but
i
am
privately
engaged
in
my
own
half
of
the
room
i
am
not
interfering
with
alice
but
you
see
kathleen
she
ca
get
to
her
half
the
door
is
in
my
half
you
know
said
kathleen
very
meekly
so
i
do
see
that
she
has
any
cause
to
complain
i
am
awfully
sorry
i
will
be
as
quick
as
i
can
you
annoy
me
very
much
you
make
me
very
uncomfortable
by
going
on
in
this
extremely
silly
way
kathleen
i
will
darn
some
more
socks
for
you
darling
tired
pet
whispered
kathleen
coaxingly
i
really
am
awfully
sorry
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
i
must
finish
my
own
private
affairs
in
my
own
half
of
the
room
she
retreated
from
the
door
and
the
scratching
of
the
pen
continued
alice
downstairs
felt
like
a
caged
lion
tennant
admitted
that
kathleen
conduct
was
very
bad
it
wo
happen
again
alice
she
said
for
i
shall
remove
the
key
from
the
lock
she
wo
shut
you
out
another
time
make
the
best
of
it
darling
if
we
do
worry
her
too
much
she
is
sure
to
capitulate
not
she
she
is
a
perfect
horror
said
alice
weldon
supper
party
was
to
begin
at
eight
it
was
now
seven
and
the
girls
were
to
call
for
alice
at
if
kathleen
would
only
be
quick
she
might
still
have
time
the
boys
came
in
they
stared
at
alice
when
they
saw
her
still
sitting
in
her
rough
school
things
a
very
cross
expression
on
her
face
david
came
up
to
her
at
once
he
was
the
favorite
and
people
said
he
had
a
way
with
him
whatever
they
meant
by
that
most
people
did
what
david
tennant
liked
he
stood
in
front
of
his
sister
now
and
said
what
the
matter
and
where
the
little
irish
beauty
for
goodness
sake
do
speak
about
her
said
alice
she
driving
me
nearly
mad
your
sister
is
naturally
much
annoyed
david
said
his
mother
kathleen
is
evidently
a
very
tiresome
girl
she
has
locked
the
door
of
their
mutual
bedroom
and
declines
to
open
it
she
says
that
as
the
door
happens
to
be
in
her
half
of
the
room
she
has
perfect
control
over
it
david
whistled
ben
burst
out
laughing
well
now
that
is
irish
david
said
if
you
take
her
part
i
shall
hate
you
all
the
rest
of
my
life
said
alice
speaking
with
great
passion
but
ca
you
wait
just
for
once
asked
david
any
one
could
tell
she
is
just
trying
it
on
she
get
tired
of
sitting
there
by
herself
if
only
you
have
patience
but
i
am
due
at
cassandra
for
supper
and
mary
addersley
and
rhoda
pierpont
are
to
call
for
me
at
seven
oh
that
it
is
it
said
ben
leave
off
teasing
for
ben
was
whistling
and
jumping
about
and
making
the
most
expressive
faces
at
poor
alice
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
he
said
and
he
ran
upstairs
david
was
very
musical
indeed
the
soul
of
music
dwelt
in
his
eyes
in
his
voice
in
his
very
step
he
might
in
some
respects
have
been
an
irish
boy
himself
he
bent
down
now
and
whistled
very
softly
and
in
the
most
manner
garry
owen
through
the
keyhole
there
was
a
restless
sound
in
the
room
and
then
a
cross
voice
said
go
away
david
stopped
whistling
garry
owen
and
proceeded
to
execute
a
most
exquisite
performance
of
patrick
day
in
the
morning
kathleen
trembled
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
david
was
now
whistling
right
into
her
room
the
wearing
of
the
green
kathleen
flung
down
her
pen
making
a
splash
on
the
paper
go
away
she
called
out
what
are
you
doing
there
the
outside
of
this
door
does
belong
to
you
called
david
and
if
i
like
to
whistle
through
the
keyhole
you
ca
prevent
me
and
he
began
garry
owen
again
kathleen
rushed
to
the
door
and
flung
it
open
the
tears
were
still
wet
on
her
cheeks
ca
you
guess
what
you
are
doing
she
said
you
are
stabbing
me
stabbing
me
oh
oh
oh
and
she
burst
into
violent
sobs
david
took
her
hand
come
little
irish
colleen
he
said
come
along
downstairs
i
am
going
to
be
chummy
with
you

so
lonely
give
alice
her
room
of
it

she

sobbed
kathleen
i
am
most
miserable
oh
garry
owen
garry
owen
oh
land
of
the
shamrock
oh
my
broken
heart
she
laid
her
head
on
david
shoulder
and
went
on
sobbing
david
felt
quite
bashful
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
take
out
his
big
and
not
too
clean
handkerchief
and
wipe
her
tears
away
whisper
he
said
in
her
ear
there
are
stables
at
the
back
of
the
house
they
are
old
stables
there
is
a
loft
over
one
and
i
keep
apples
and
nuts
there
it
the
jolliest
place
will
you
and
i
go
there
for
an
hour
or
two
after
supper
do
you
mean
it
said
kathleen
her
eyes
filling
with
laughter
and
the
tears
still
wet
on
her
cheeks
yes
colleen
i
mean
it
for
i
want
you
to
tell
me
all
you
can
about
your
land
of
the
shamrock
why

i
will
she
replied
wisha
then
david
it
a
broth
of
a
boy
you
are
and
she
kissed
him
on
his
forehead
david
took
her
hand
and
led
her
into
the
alice
was
still
there
looking
more
stormy
than
ever
it
too
late
now
she
said
the
girls
have
come
and
gone
i
ca
go
at
all
now
but
why
darling
said
kathleen
oh
i
wish
i
had
let
you
she
must
go
david
the
poor
dear
it
would
be
cruel
to
disappoint
what
dress
will
you
wear
said
kathleen
let
me
alone
said
alice
she
rushed
upstairs
but
kathleen
was
even
quicker
i
not
going
to
be
nasty
to
you
any
more
she
said
i
have
found
a
friend
and
i
shall
have
more
friends
kathleen
would
have
died
long
ago
but
for
her
friends
i
shall
be
happy
when
i
have
got
a
creelful
of
them
here
now
then
let
me
help
you
no
that
is
the
shoe
you
want
here
it
is
and
gloves
here
a
pair
and
they
neatly
mended
which
hat
did
you
say
the
one
with
the
blue
scarf
round
it
is
it
a
pretty
one
you
put
that
on
aunt
katie
is
going
to
send
me
a
box
of
clothes
from
dublin
and
i
will
give
you
some
of
them
you
must
say
no
i
will
give
you
some
if
you
are
nice
i
am
ever
so
sorry
that
i
kept
you
out
of
your
part
of
the
room
i
wo
do
it
any
more
now
you
are
dressed
that
fine
you
wo
hate
me
forever
will
you
alice
growled
something
in
reply
she
had
not
kathleen
passionate
quick
impulsive
nature
furious
with
rage
one
minute
sweet
and
gentle
and
affectionate
the
next
she
hated
kathleen
for
having
humiliated
and
annoyed
her
and
she
went
off
to
cassandra
house
knowing
that
she
would
be
late
and
determined
not
to
say
one
good
word
for
kathleen
chapter
wit
and
genius
the
plan
propounded
while
kathleen
was
locked
in
alice
room
she
was
writing
to
her
father
my
darling
if
ever
there
was
a
cold
dreary
abominable
land
it
is
this
where
they
wave
the
british
flag
the
ugliness
of
it
would
make
you
sick
the
people
are
as
ugly
as
the
country
and
they
so
stiff
and
if
you
suppose
for
a
moment
that
your
wild
irish
girl
can
stand
much
of
this
sort
of
thing
you
are
fine
and
mistaken
and
you
can
tell
the
mother
so
i
mean
to
write
to
aunt
katie
and
give
her
a
fine
piece
of
my
mind
early
in
the
day
dad
i
did
not
think
that
i
could
stay
at
all
but
i
have
got
a
plan
in
my
head
now
and
if
i
succeed
i
may
at
least
put
up
with
one
term
of
this
detestable
school
i
wo
tell
you
the
plan
for
you
might
approve
in
fact

can
guess
in
advance
that
you
would
approve
anyhow
it
is
going
to
occupy
the
time
and
thoughts
of
your
kathleen
now

a
good
bit
of
money

send
me
a
note
daddy
mine
and
say
nothing
whatever
about
it
to
the
mother
or
the
retainers
at
carrigrohane
and
can
you
let
me
have
it
as
quick
as
quick
can
be
maybe
i
will
want
more
before
the
term
is
up
or
maybe
i
wo
anyhow
we
will
let
that
lie
in
the
future
oh
my
broth
of
an
old
dad
would
i
like
to
hug
you
this
blessed
minute
how
is
everybody

the
mountains
how

the
sea

young
cousins
of

behaving
themselves

spalpeens
and
how
are
you
my
heart
of
hearts
missing
your
kathleen

well

more
for
the
present
they
rattling
at
the
door
like
anything
and

detestable
boy
now
whistling
owen
right
into
my
heart
you
ca
imagine
what
i
am
feeling
oh
the
omadhaun
he
is
changing
it
now
into
patrick
day
wisha
then
daddy
i
must
stop
for
it
more
than
the
heart
of
woman
can
stand
your
affectionate
daughter
kathleen
this
letter
was
posted
by
kathleen
herself
after
supper
she
went
with
david
into
the
old
loft
over
the
stables
it
was
not
a
very
safe
place
of
refuge
for
the
rafters
were
rotten
and
might
tumble
down
at
any
time
still
the
sense
of
danger
made
it
all
the
more
interesting
to
the
children
there
they
sat
side
by
side
and
kathleen
told
david
about
her
old
life
she
was
very
outspoken
and
affectionate
and
very
fierce
and
very
wild
to
look
at
her
one
would
have
said
there
never
was
any
one
less
reserved
but
kathleen
in
her
heart
of
hearts
was
intensely
reserved
her
real
feelings
she
never
told
her
real
hopes
she
never
breathed
she
talked
with
high
spirits
all
the
time
and
although
she
liked
david
and
was
much
comforted
by
his
words
and
his
actions
he
did
not
get
at
the
real
kathleen
at
all
when
alice
came
back
that
evening
kathleen
was
sound
asleep
in
her
little
bed
dreaming
of
carrigrohane
and
the
old
home
she
was
murmuring
some
loving
words
as
alice
entered
the
room
oh
daddy
mine
my
heart
is
sore
for
you
she
was
saying
in
a
tone
which
caused
alice
to
pause
and
look
at
her
attentively
she
is
the
most
awful
girl
i
ever
heard
of
thought
alice
i
am
sure
she
will
get
us
into
trouble
i
know
that
those
three
guineas
a
week
that
mother
gets
for
having
her
are
not
worth
all
the
mischief
she
will
drag
us
into
but
still
she
does
look
pretty
when
she
is
asleep
kathleen
had
very
long
and
very
thick
eyelashes
and
nobly
arched
brows
her
forehead
was
broad
and
full
and
beautifully
white
the
mischievous
expression
of
her
face
when
awake
was
softened
in
her
sleep
alice
who
had
determined
to
come
very
noisily
into
the
room
and
bang
her
things
about
to
take
rude
possession
of
her
own
half
of
the
room
which
after
all
was
the
better
half
was
softened
by
the
look
on
the
girl
face
she
knelt
for
a
moment
at
her
bedside
and
prayed
that
god
would
keep
her
from
quite
hating
kathleen
this
was
a
great
deal
from
alice
who
had
made
up
her
mind
never
to
be
friends
with
the
irish
girl
then
she
got
into
bed
and
fell
asleep
the
next
morning
quite
early
kathleen
was
up
she
was
accustomed
to
getting
up
almost
at
at
carrigrohane
and
when
alice
opened
her
eyes
it
was
to
see
an
empty
bed
and
an
empty
room
i
wonder
if
she
up
to
mischief
she
thought
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
kathleen
was
walking
across
the
common
she
had
no
hat
on
and
no
jacket
she
was
stepping
along
leisurely
looking
up
sometimes
at
the
sky
and
sometimes
pausing
as
though
she
was
thinking
hard
she
will
catch
cold
and
be
ill
that
will
be
the
next
trouble
thought
the
indignant
alice
she
sleepily
proceeded
with
her
dressing
it
was
only
seven
the
great
shirley
school
met
at
nine
alice
was
seldom
downstairs
until
past
eight
when
she
came
down
this
morning
she
saw
to
her
amazement
kathleen
helping
the
very
untidy
to
lay
the
breakfast
things
she
was
dashing
about
putting
plates
and
cups
and
saucers
anyhow
upon
the
board
now
then
maria
she
said
shall
i
run
down
to
the
kitchen
and
bring
up
the
hot
bacon
and
the
porridge
i
will
with
a
heart
and
a
half
oh
you
poor
girl
how
tired
you
look
maria
whom
alice
never
noticed
looked
with
adoring
eyes
at
beautiful
kathleen
it
is
right
miss
i
ought
to
be
doing
my
own
work
she
said
i
am
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
miss
wisha
then
it
is
i
who
like
to
help
you
said
kathleen
for
you
look
fair
beat
she
dashed
past
alice
and
appeared
the
next
moment
in
the
kitchen
where
the
bacon
cook
and
where
the
bread
and
where
the
butter
and
all
the
rest
of
the
breakfast
see
woman
see
give
me
a
tray
and
i
will
fill
it
up
and
take
the
things
upstairs
with
my
own
hands
you
think
it
is
beneath
me
perhaps
but
i
am
a
lady
from
a
castle
and
at
carrigrohane
castle
we
often
do
this
sort
of
thing
when
the
hands
of
the
poor
maids
are
full
to
overflowing
the
cook
a
and
woman
began
by
scowling
at
kathleen
but
soon
the
girl
pretty
face
and
merry
eyes
appeased
her
she
and
kathleen
had
almost
a
quarrel
as
to
who
was
to
carry
up
the
tray
but
kathleen
won
the
day
and
when
tennant
made
her
appearance
feeling
tired
and
overdone
she
was
amazed
to
see
kathleen
acting
i
love
it
she
said
if
i
can
help
you
you
dear
tired
worn
one
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
i
am
sure
mother
said
alice
it
is
very
good
of
kathleen
to
wish
to
do
the
household
work
but
as
she
has
been
sent
here
to
gain
some
information
of
another
sort
do
you
think
it
ought
to
be
allowed
and
who
will
prevent
it
darling
that
is
the
question
said
kathleen
in
her
softest
voice
alice
was
silent
i
tell
you
what
said
kathleen
when
i
see
you
beginning
to
help
your
poor
exhausted
mother
and
running
messages
for
that
overworked
slavey
i
think
you
call
her
maria
then
perhaps
i
do
less
and
when
there
some
one
else
to
mend
the
boys
socks
perhaps
i
wo
offer
but
until
there
is
the
less
you
say
about
such
things
the
better
miss
alice
tennant
ben
kicked
david
under
the
table
and
david
kicked
him
back
to
stay
quiet
altogether
the
breakfast
was
a
noisy
one
kathleen
went
to
school
quite
prepared
to
carry
out
her
promise
to
susy
hopkins
she
had
neatly
packed
the
little
irish
diamond
brooch
in
a
box
and
had
slipped
under
it
a
tiny
note
get
as
many
foundation
girls
as
you
can
to
meet
me
at
whatever
place
you
like
to
appoint
this
evening
i
have
a
plan
to
kathleen
you
can
name
the
place
by
pinning
a
note
under
my
desk
be
sure
you
all
come
the
plan
is
gloryious
the
thought
of
the
note
and
the
plan
and
the
little
brooch
kept
kathleen
in
a
fairly
good
humor
on
her
walk
to
school
there
she
saw
ruth
craven
she
was
decidedly
angry
with
ruth
for
having
as
she
said
to
herself
snubbed
her
the
day
before
but
beauty
always
had
a
curious
effect
on
the
irish
girl
and
when
she
observed
ruth
really
exquisite
little
face
clear
cut
as
a
cameo
with
eyes
full
of
expression
and
watched
the
lips
ready
to
break
into
the
gentlest
smiles
kathleen
said
to
herself
it
is
all
over
with
me
she
is
the
only
colleen
i
have
met
in
this
country
make
up
to
her
i
will
she
dashed
therefore
almost
rudely
through
a
great
mass
of
incoming
girls
and
seized
ruth
by
her
shoulder
ruth
she
said
go
and
talk
to
susy
hopkins
during
recess
she
will
have
something
to
say
and
i
want
you
so
badly
you
wo
refuse
me
will
you
ruth
but
i
do
know
what
you
want
said
ruth
go
and
talk
to
susy
hopkins
she
will
know
oh
there
she
is
kathleen
kathleen
called
out
alice
the
has
just
rung
and
they
are
opening
the
doors
come
do
come
in
a
jiff
replied
kathleen
she
ran
up
to
susy
this
is
what
i
promised
she
said
and
there
is
a
note
inside
read
it
and
give
me
the
answer
where
i
have
asked
you
susy
hopkins
a
most
ordinary
little
girl
who
had
no
position
of
any
sort
in
the
school
colored
high
with
delight
some
of
the
paying
girls
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
susy
walked
into
the
school
with
her
head
high
in
the
air
she
quite
adored
kathleen
for
she
was
making
her
a
person
of
great
distinction
we
are
going
to
have
a
glorious
time
whispered
susy
to
kate
rourke
as
they
made
their
way
to
their
respective
classes
susy
was
small
rather
stupid
and
absolutely
unimportant
kate
was
big
impudent
she
was
jealous
of
the
paying
girls
of
the
school
but
she
treated
susy
as
some
one
beneath
contempt
do
drag
my
sleeve
she
replied
crossly
and
what
you
do
mean
by
a
glorious
time
i
do
understand
you
you
will
presently
said
susy
and
when
all
is
said
and
done
you
will
have
to
remember
that
you
owe
it
to
me
but
i
have
no
time
to
talk
now
only
meet
me
and
bring
as
many
of
the
foundationers
as
you
can
collect
into
the
corner
of
the
playground
just
behind
the
botanical
laboratory
at
recess
kate
made
no
answer
unless
a
toss
of
her
head
could
have
been
taken
as
a
reply
her
first
impulse
was
to
take
no
notice
of
remarks
little
susy
hopkins
the
daughter
of
a
small
stationer
in
the
town
a
girl
who
had
scarcely
scraped
through
in
her
examination
it
was
intolerable
that
she
should
put
on
such
airs
the
work
of
the
school
began
and
all
the
girls
were
busy
kate
was
clever
and
she
meant
to
try
for
one
of
the
big
scholarships
she
would
get
her
forty
pounds
a
year
when
the
time
came
and
go
to
holloway
college
or
some
other
college
she
was
not
a
lady
by
birth
she
had
not
a
single
instinct
of
a
true
lady
within
her
but
she
was
intensely
ambitious
she
did
not
care
so
much
for
beauty
as
for
style
she
made
style
her
idol
the
look
that
cassandra
wore
as
she
walked
quietly
across
the
room
the
set
of
her
dress
the
still
more
wonderful
set
of
her
head
as
it
was
placed
on
her
queenly
young
shoulders
these
were
the
things
that
burnt
into
kate
soul
and
made
her
restless
and
dissatisfied
she
would
willingly
have
given
all
her
wealth
and
he
was
quite
for
his
class
to
have
face
cassandra
voice
cassandra
figure
cassandra
was
not
at
all
a
pretty
girl
but
her
appearance
appealed
to
all
the
wild
ambitions
in
kate
soul
she
had
a
jealous
contempt
of
ruth
craven
who
although
a
foundation
girl
managed
to
look
like
a
lady
but
her
envy
was
centered
round
cassandra
as
to
the
irish
girl
she
had
scarcely
noticed
her
up
to
the
present
work
went
on
that
morning
with
much
verve
and
vigor
it
was
a
pleasant
morning
the
windows
were
open
the
schoolrooms
were
all
well
ventilated
the
teachers
the
best
of
their
kind
were
stimulating
in
their
lectures
and
in
their
conversation
there
was
a
look
of
business
and
animation
throughout
the
whole
place
it
was
like
a
hive
of
bees
at
last
the
moment
of
recess
arrived
kate
just
raised
her
head
looked
over
the
shoulders
of
her
companions
and
saw
susy
hopkins
darting
restlessly
about
catching
one
girl
by
the
sleeve
another
by
the
arm
whispering
in
the
ear
of
a
third
flinging
her
arm
round
the
neck
of
a
fourth
and
as
she
spoke
to
the
girls
they
looked
interested
astonished
and
cordial
they
moved
away
to
that
lonely
part
of
the
playground
which
was
situated
at
the
back
of
the
botanical
laboratory
kate
had
made
up
her
mind
not
to
take
the
least
notice
of
susy
she
was
pacing
up
and
down
alone
for
most
provoking
all
her
chosen
friends
had
gone
off
with
that
young
lady
suddenly
she
saw
ruth
craven
going
very
quietly
by
by
all
the
laws
of
the
foundationers
ruth
ought
to
speak
to
her
companions
in
misfortune
kate
rushed
up
to
her
what
are
they
all
doing
there
she
said
do
you
happen
to
know
susy
hopkins
no
replied
ruth
gently
she
came
up
to
me
just
now
and
asked
me
to
join
her
and
some
other
girls
at
the
back
of
the
laboratory
i
know
that
i
want
to
i
am
curious
said
kate
of
course
i
am
no
friend
of
susy
she
is
a
most
contemptible
little
wretch
but
i
may
as
well
know
what
it
is
all
about
come
with
me
wo
you
ruth
hesitated
come
along
we
may
as
well
know
there
is
probably
some
mischief
on
foot
and
it
is
only
fair
that
we
should
be
forewarned
i
do
want
to
know
said
ruth
but
as
kate
slipped
her
hand
through
her
arm
and
pulled
her
along
she
said
resignedly
well
if
i
must
i
must
as
they
strolled
across
the
big
playground
ruth
turned
and
glanced
at
cassandra
but
cassandra
was
busy
making
friends
with
florence
who
was
very
angry
with
her
for
her
desertion
of
the
day
before
and
took
no
notice
of
ruth
the
irish
girl
was
nowhere
in
sight
ruth
sighed
and
continued
her
walk
with
kate
the
most
lonely
and
most
dreary
part
of
the
playground
was
that
little
portion
which
was
situated
at
the
back
of
the
laboratory
nothing
grew
there
the
ground
was
innocent
of
grass
and
much
worn
by
the
tramping
of
young
feet
there
were
swings
and
and
preparations
for
tennis
and
other
games
in
the
rest
of
the
big
playground
but
nothing
had
ever
been
done
at
the
back
of
the
laboratory
when
the
two
girls
arrived
they
found
five
other
girls
waiting
for
them
their
names
were
of
course
susy
hopkins
who
considered
herself
on
this
delightful
occasion
quite
the
leader
a
gentle
and
girl
of
the
name
of
mary
rand
rosy
myers
who
was
pretty
and
frivolous
with
dark
eyes
and
fair
hair
clara
sawyer
who
was
renowned
for
her
vulgar
taste
in
dress
and
hannah
johnson
a
girl
with
a
scowling
brow
and
a
very
pronounced
jaw
hannah
johnson
was
about
the
plainest
girl
in
the
school
when
susy
saw
kate
rourke
and
ruth
craven
she
uttered
a
little
scream
of
delight
now
we
are
complete
she
said
listen
to
me
all
you
girls
for
i
have
too
long
in
which
to
tell
you
that
horrid
bell
will
ring
us
back
to
lessons
and
dullness
in
less
than
no
time
the
most
wonderful
delightful
chance
is
offered
to
us
i
met
her
yesterday
and
she
decided
to
do
it
she
is
a
brick
of
bricks
she
will
make
the
most
tremendous
difference
in
our
lives
you
know
although
you
pretend
not
to
feel
it
but
you
all
must
know
how
we
foundationers
are
sat
upon
and
objected
to
in
the
school
we
bear
it
as
meekly
as
we
can
for
the
sake
of
our
advantages
but
if
we
can
be
snubbed
we
are
and
if
we
can
be
neglected
we
are
although
it
is
the
teachers
we
have
to
complain
of
but
the
girls
sometimes
things
are
past
bearing
and
yet
we
are
powerless
there
are
three
hundred
paying
girls
and
there
are
one
hundred
foundationers
what
chance
has
one
hundred
against
three
what
is
the
good
of
bringing
all
that
up
susy
said
mary
rand
we
are
foundationers
and
we
ought
to
be
thankful

not
to
forget

fine

she
said
just
because

of
your
fine
friends
does
pay
for
you
and
so
save
your
position
out
and
out
i
would
allow
her
to
replied
ruth
her
eyes
flashing
fire
i
had
much
rather

a
foundationer
i
mean
to
prove
that

am
every
bit

good
as

proudly
to
the
irish
diamond
brooch
which
she
had
stuck
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
the
diamond
had
been
polished
and
flashed
brightly
the
silver
setting
was
also
as
good
as
was
to
be
found
the
girls
crowded
round
to
admire
and
oh

to
say
you
are
mad
with
jealousy
and
you
know
it
answered
susy
well
i
am
coming
to
the
great
news
the
irish
girl
name
is
kathleen
and
she
comes
from
a
castle
over
in
the
wild
west
of
ireland
her
father
is
very
rich
and
he
keeps
dogs
and
horses
and
carriages
and
oh
everything
that
rich
people
keep
compared
to
the
other
girls
in
the
school
she
is
ten
times
a
lady
and
she
has
a
true
lady
heart
and
she
has
taken
a
dislike
as
far
as
i
can
see
to
alice
tennant
and
i
sure
i
not
surprised
said
rosy
myers
thing
said
clara
sawyer
dirt
beneath
our
feet
exclaimed
hannah
johnson
well
she
does
like
her
either
though
she
does
use
that
kind
of
language
continued
susy
anyhow
she
wants
to
befriend
oh
do
let
me
speak
as
kate
interrupted
with
a
hasty
exclamation
she
thinks
that
we
are
just
as
good
as
herself
there
is
no
false
pride
about
a
real
lady
girls
and
the
end
of
it
is
that
she
has
a
plan
to
propose
something
for
our
benefit
and
for
her
benefit
see
for
yourselves
this
is
her
letter
it
is
in
her
own
beautiful
irish
handwriting
you
can
read
it
only
do
tear
it
all
to
bits
the
girls
did
read
the
letter
they
pressed
close
together
and
one
peeped
over
the
shoulder
of
her
companion
another
stood
on
tiptoe
while
a
third
tried
to
snatch
the
letter
from
the
hand
of
her
fellow
but
all
managed
to
read
the
words
get
as
many
foundation
girls
as
you
can
to
meet
me
at
whatever
place
you
like
to
appoint
this
evening
i
have
a
plan
to
propose
this
letter
and
the
end
of
the
postscript
excited
the
girls
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
of
that
the
plan
is
they
laughed
at
the
word
smiled
into
each
others
faces
and
stood
very
close
together
consulting
the
old
quarry
whispered
rosy
that
the
place
exclaimed
mary
let
us
meet
her
we
seven
by
ourselves
was
kate
final
suggestion
we
will
then
know
what
she
wants
and
if
there
is
anything
in
it
we
can
form
a
committee
and
get
other
girls
to
join
by
degrees
hurrah
i
do
say
this
is
fun
susy
was
now
quite
petted
by
her
companions
the
conference
hastily
ended
and
on
entering
the
school
susy
pinned
a
piece
of
paper
under
kathleen
desk
on
which
she
wrote
the
old
quarry
nine
this
evening
will
meet
you
at
a
quarter
to
nine
outside
house
when
kathleen
received
the
communication
her
eyes
flashed
with
delighted
fire
she
thrust
the
letter
into
her
pocket
and
proceeded
with
her
work
the
irish
girl
looked
quite
happy
that
day
she
had
something
to
interest
her
at
last
her
lessons
too
were
by
no
means
distasteful
she
had
a
great
deal
of
quick
wit
and
ready
perception
hitherto
she
had
been
taught
anyhow
but
now
she
was
all
keen
to
receive
real
instruction
her
intuitions
were
rapid
indeed
she
could
come
to
startlingly
quick
conclusions
and
as
a
rule
her
guesses
were
correct
rather
than
otherwise
kathleen
had
a
passion
for
music
she
had
never
been
properly
taught
but
the
soul
of
music
was
in
her
as
much
as
it
was
in
david
tennant
she
had
a
beautiful
melodious
voice
which
had
of
course
not
yet
come
to
maturity
just
before
the
end
of
the
morning
she
took
her
first
lesson
in
music
her
mistress
was
a
very
amiable
and
clever
woman
of
the
name
of
agnes
spicer
miss
spicer
put
a
sheet
of
music
before
her
play
that
she
said
kathleen
frowned
her
delicate
white
fingers
trembled
for
an
instant
on
the
keys
she
played
one
or
two
bars
perforce
and
very
badly
then
she
dashed
the
sheet
of
music
in
an
impetuous
way
to
the
floor
i
ca
she
said
it
is
my
style
may
i
play
you
something
different
miss
spicer
was
about
to
refuse
but
looking
at
the
girl
whose
cheeks
were
flushed
and
eyes
full
of
fire
she
changed
her
mind
just
this
once
she
said
but
you
must
begin
to
practice
properly
what
i
call
amateur
music
ca
be
allowed
here
will
this
be
allowed
said
kathleen
she
dashed
into
heavy
chords
played
lightly
a
delicate
movement
and
then
broke
into
an
irish
air
the
harp
that
once
through
tara
halls
from
one
irish
melody
to
another
her
light
fingers
wandered
she
played
with
perfect
correctness
with
fire
with
spirit
soon
she
forgot
herself
when
she
stopped
tears
were
running
down
her
cheeks
what
is
music
after
all
she
said
looking
full
into
the
face
of
her
teacher
when
you
are
far
from
the
land
you
love
how
can
you
stand
music
then
no
i
do
mean
to
learn
at
the
great
shirley
school
i
ca
when
i
am
back
again
at
home
i
shall
play
harp
that
once
through
tara
halls
but
i
ca
do
it
justice
here
you
will
excuse
me
i
ca
i
am
sorry
if
i
am
rude
but
it
is
in
me
some
time
if
you
have
a
headache
and
feel
very
bad
as
my
dear
father
does
sometimes
i
shall
play
to
you
but
i
ca
learn
as
the
other
girls
learn
it
is
in
me
again
she
put
her
fingers
on
the
keys
of
the
piano
and
brought
forth
a
few
sobbing
notes
then
she
started
up
i
expect
you
will
punish
me
for
this
miss
spicer
but
i
am
sorry
i
ca
help
myself
strange
to
say
miss
spicer
did
not
punish
her
on
the
contrary
she
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
i
wo
ask
you
to
do
any
more
she
said
i
see
you
are
not
like
others
i
will
talk
the
matter
over
with
you
and
you
will
find
me
unchanged
said
kathleen
thank
you
all
the
same
for
your
forbearance
chapter
vi
the
poor
tired
one
tennant
spent
the
afternoon
out
shopping
she
told
the
girls
at
dinner
that
she
would
be
home
for
tea
that
she
expected
to
be
rather
tired
and
hoped
that
they
would
be
as
good
as
possible
the
boys
were
always
out
during
the
afternoon
and
as
a
rule
never
returned
until
after
tea
but
alice
and
kathleen
were
expected
to
be
in
for
this
meal
when
tennant
walked
down
the
street
kathleen
went
to
the
window
and
looked
after
her
what
are
you
going
to
do
this
afternoon
said
alice
who
was
lying
back
in
an
with
an
open
novel
in
her
hand
i
do
know
replied
kathleen
what
a
dull
hole
this
is
how
can
you
have
grown
up
and
kept
well
in
a
place
like
this
opinions
differ
with
regard
to
its
dullness
said
alice
i
think
our
home
a
very
pleasant
entertaining
place
i
would
live
in
your
wild
castle
for
all
you
could
give
me
nobody
asked
you
my
dear
said
kathleen
with
a
saucy
nod
of
her
head
she
left
the
room
and
went
up
to
what
she
called
her
half
of
the
bedroom
on
the
next
floor
she
knelt
down
by
the
window
and
looked
across
over
the
ugly
landscape
there
were
houses
everywhere
not
a
scrap
of
real
country
as
she
expressed
it
to
be
found
she
took
out
of
her
pocket
the
letter
which
the
foundation
girls
had
sent
her
and
opened
and
read
it
the
old
quarry
i
wonder
where
the
old
quarry
is
she
thought
it
must
be
a
good
way
from
here
we
have
such
a
place
at
home
too
i
did
not
suppose
one
was
to
be
found
in
this
horrid
part
of
the
world
i
am
rather
glad
there
is
an
old
quarry
it
was
quite
nice
of
little
susy
to
suggest
it
and
she
will
meet
me
the
little
colleen
that
is
good
what
fun
i
shall
probably
have
to
return
through
the
bedroom
window
so
i
may
as
well
explore
and
make
all
in
readiness
dear
dear
i
should
like
david
to
help
me
it
is
the
naughtiness
that
i
care
about
but
it
is
the
fun
of
being
naughty
it
is
the
fun
of
having
a
sort
of
dangerous
thing
to
do
that
is
the
real
joy
of
it
it
is
the
ecstacy
of
shocking
the
prim
alice
oh
there
is
her
step
she
coming
up
the
creature
now
then
i
had
best
be
as
mum
as
i
can
unless
i
want
to
distract
the
poor
thing
entirely
alice
entered
the
room
do
you
greatly
object
to
shutting
the
window
she
said
to
kathleen
i
have
a
slight
cold
and
the
draught
will
make
it
worse
why
then
of
course
darling
said
kathleen
in
a
hearty
voice
as
she
brought
down
the
window
with
a
bang
would
you
like
me
to
shut
the
ventilator
in
the
grate
she
then
asked
no
how
silly
you
are
is
it
silly
i
thought
you
had
a
cold
you
are
afraid
of
the
draughts
why
are
you
going
out
i
want
to
see
a
school
friend
you
will
be
back
in
time
for
tea
wo
you
ca
say
but
your
mother
the
poor
tired
one
asked
you
to
be
back
i
do
wish
kathleen
that
you
would
call
mother
by
that
ridiculous
name
she
is
no
more
tired
than
than
other
women
are
if
that
is
the
case
said
kathleen
i
heartily
hope
that
i
shall
not
live
to
be
a
woman
i
would
like
us
all
to
be
as
fagged
as
she
is
poor
dear
gentle
soul
she
overworked
and
that
the
truth
kathleen
saw
that
she
was
annoying
alice
and
proceeded
with
great
gusto
to
expand
her
theory
with
regard
to
tennant
she
in
the
condition
when
she
might
drop
any
time
she
said
we
have
had
old
irishwomen
overworked
like
that
and
all
of
a
sudden
they
went
out
like
snuffs
that
is
what
happens
what
are
you
putting
on
your
best
hat
for
that
is
no
affair
of
yours
oh
how
grand
we
are
do
you
know
alice
you
have
got
at
all
nice
manners
you
think
you
have
but
you
have
we
are
never
rude
like
that
in
ireland
we
tell
a
few
lies
now
and
then
but
they
are
only
lies
the
kind
that
make
other
people
happy
alice
i
should
like
to
know
which
is
best
to
be
horribly
cross
or
to
tell
nice
polite
lies
which
is
the
most
wicked
i
should
like
to
know
then
i
will
tell
you
said
alice
what
you
call
a
nice
lie
is
just
a
very
great
and
awful
sin
and
if
you
do
believe
me
go
to
church
and
listen
when
the
commandments
are
read
in
future
said
kathleen
very
calmly
now
that
i
really
know
your
views
i
will
always
tell
you
you
ca
blame
me
can
you
alice
deigned
no
answer
she
went
downstairs
and
let
herself
out
of
the
house
and
that
is
the
sort
of
girl
i
have
exchanged
for
daddy
and
the
mother
and
the
boys
thought
the
irish
girl
oh
dear
oh
dear
kathleen
flew
downstairs
it
was
nearly
three
tea
was
to
be
on
the
table
at
four
quick
as
thought
she
dashed
into
the
kitchen
maria
she
said
and
cook
is
there
anything
nice
and
tasty
for
tea
this
evening
nice
and
tasty
miss
said
cook
and
what
should
there
be
nice
and
tasty
there
bread
and
there
butter
dorset
dorset
and
there
jam
if
there
any
left
and
that
about
all
that
sort
of
tea
is
very
nourishing
cook
is
it
i
ask
because
i
want
to
know
said
kathleen
it
the
kind
we
always
have
at
myrtle
lodge
replied
cook
i
hold
with
it
but
then
it
the
way
of
the
missis
i
have
got
some
money
in
my
pocket
said
kathleen
i
want
to
have
a
beautiful
nice
tea
ca
you
think
of
something
to
buy
here
five
shillings
would
that
get
her
a
nice
tea
a
nice
tea
cried
maria
it
would
get
a
beautiful
meal
and
the
poor
missis
she
would
like
it
then
go
out
maria
do
like
a
darling
i
will
open
the
door
for
you
if
anybody
calls
do
run
round
the
corner
and
bring

oh
i
know
what
we
have
sausages
they
are
delicious
and
a
little
tin
of
sardines
wo
they
be
good
and
some
and
some
shrimps
oh
yes
shrimps
be
quick
and
we
will
put
out
the
best
and
a
clean
cloth
and
it
will
rest
the
poor
tired
one
so
tremendously
when
she
comes
in
and
sees
a
good
meal
on
the
table
both
cook
and
maria
were
quite
excited
perhaps
they
had
an
eye
to
the
reversion
of
the
tea
the
sausages
the
sardines
the
shrimps
and
the
maria
went
out
and
kathleen
stood
in
the
hall
two
or
three
people
arrived
during
maria
absence
and
kathleen
went
promptly
to
the
door
and
said
not
at
home
in
a
determined
voice
and
with
rather
a
scowling
face
to
these
arrivals
some
of
the
visitors
left
rather
important
messages
but
kathleen
did
not
remember
them
for
more
than
a
moment
after
they
were
delivered
maria
presently
came
back
and
the
was
laid
kathleen
gave
maria
sixpence
for
the
washing
of
an
extra
cloth
and
the
table
looked
quite
fresh
and
wonderfully
like
a
when
tennant
returned
she
came
in
looking
very
hot
and
tired
it
was
to
see
the
room
tidy
kathleen
seated
in
her
own
special
chair
cobbling
the
boys
socks
as
hard
as
she
could
and
an
appetizing
tea
on
the
table
what
does
this
mean
said
tennant
it
means
said
kathleen
jumping
up
that
you
are
to
plant
yourself
just
here
and
you
are
not
to
stir
oh
i
know
you
are
tired
i
will
take
off
your
shoes
poor
dear
i
have
brought
your
slippers
down
on
purpose
and
you
are
to
have
your
tea
at
this
little
table
now
what
will
you
have
hot
sausages
they
are
done
to
a
turn

they
maria
that
they
are
miss
a
nice
hot
sausage

toast
and
a
lovely
cup
of
tea
with
cream
in
it
but
but
said
tennant
what
will
alice
say
maria
and
i
do
care
twopence
what
alice
says
this
is
my
tea
and
maria
fetched

then
dear
tired
one

and
rest
tennant
looked
at
kathleen
with
loving
eyes
did
you
buy
these
things
she
said
that
she
did
cried
maria
i
never
did
see
a
more
thoughtful
young
lady
my
dear
child
said
tennant
you
are
too
good
kathleen
laughed
if
there
is
one
thing
i
am
it
is
not
that
she
said
i
am
not
a
bit
good
i
am
as
wild
and
naughty
and
oh
but
do
let
us
talk
about
me
i
am
so
hungry
you
know
i
did
much
like
your
dinner
i
am
not
fond
of
those
watery
stews
of
course
i
can
eat
anything
but
i
do
specially
like
them
so
if
you
do
mind
i
will
have
a
sausage
too
and
a
plateful
of
shrimps
afterwards
and
some
sardines
and
this
nice
the
leaves
are
not
quite
so
brown
as
i
should
like
oh
we
did
have
such
lovely
in
the
stream
at
home
tennant
you
must
come
back
with
me
to
carrigrohane
some
day
and
then
you
will
have
a
real
rest
tennant
feeling
very
much
like
a
naughty
child
herself
enjoyed
her
tea
she
and
kathleen
laughed
over
the
shrimps
exclaimed
at
the
fun
of
eating
the
enjoyed
the
sausages
and
each
drank
four
cups
of
tea
it
was
when
the
meal
had
come
to
an
end
that
kathleen
said
calmly
three
or
four
or
perhaps
five
ladies
called
while
maria
was
out
who
were
they
dear
i
do
know
they
left
messages
and
i
have
forgotten
them
one
lady
was
dressed
in
what
i
should
call
a
very
loud
style
she
was
quite
old
her
face
was
all
over
wrinkles
she
was
stout
and
she
wore
a
short
jacket
and
a
big
very
big
you
do
mean
said
tennant
that
dalzell
has
called
she
is
one
of
my
most
important
friends
she
promised
to
help
me
with
regard
to
david
future
what
did
she
say
ca
you
remember
i
am
ever
so
sorry
but
i
ca
i
kept
staring
at
her
hat
all
the
time
i
do
remember
anything
about
her
except
that
she
was
old
and
had
wrinkles
and
a
big
the
sort
of
hat
that
ruth
craven
would
look
pretty
in
tennant
began
to
find
the
remembrance
of
her
delightful
tea
a
little
depressing
for
question
kathleen
as
she
might
she
did
not
remember
anything
about
the
ladies
except
a
few
fugitive
descriptions
as
far
as
tennant
could
make
out
people
who
were
of
the
greatest
importance
to
her
had
left
messages
and
yet
none
of
the
messages
could
be
attended
to
i
ca
even
imagine
who
the
other
ladies
can
be
she
said
but
as
to
dalzell
she
must
not
be
neglected
i
must
go
out
and
see
her
at
once
then
you
will
be
more
tired
than
ever
and
i
have
not
done
a
scrap
of
good
you
meant
very
kindly
my
dear
child
and
have
given
me
a
delicious
and
strengthening
tea
only
do
do
it
again
darling
for
it
is
my
place
to
give
you
tea
not
yours
to
give
it
to
me
chapter
vii
the
queen
and
her
secret
society
tennant
had
not
been
out
more
than
a
minute
or
two
before
david
and
ben
came
in
kathleen
saw
them
from
the
window
she
tapped
on
the
window
with
her
knuckles
nodded
to
them
kissed
her
hand
and
looked
radiant
with
delight
some
boys
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
saw
her
and
burst
out
laughing
david
face
grew
red
i
wish
the
little
irish
girl
would
make
us
figures
of
fun
said
ben
speaking
in
an
annoyed
tone
the
next
instant
david
had
opened
the
door
with
his
latchkey
and
kathleen
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
hall
sausages
she
said
bringing
out
the
word
with
great
gusto
and
shrimps
and
and
sardines
besides
galore
and
nice
hot
tea
maria
is
making
fresh
tea
now
in
the
kitchen
come
along
in
do
you
must
be
ravenous
the
boys
stared
at
her
ben
forgot
his
anger
he
was
schoolboy
enough
to
thoroughly
enjoy
the
delicious
meal
which
kathleen
had
prepared
when
it
came
to
an
end
david
jumped
up
impatiently
where
are
you
going
dave
asked
kathleen
in
an
interested
voice
she
wanted
him
to
help
her
she
had
hoped
that
he
and
she
would
go
away
to
the
old
loft
together
and
talk
as
they
had
done
the
night
before
but
david
was
firm
i
am
going
to
the
church
he
said
to
practice
on
the
organ
i
only
get
the
chance
three
times
a
week
and
i
must
not
neglect
it
david
hopes
to
be
no
end
of
a
swell
some
day
remarked
ben
he
thinks
he
can
make
the
instrument
speak
and
so
can
i
said
kathleen
may
i
come
with
you
dave
some
day
he
replied
looking
at
her
kindly
but
not
i
be
back
as
soon
as
i
can
david
did
not
notice
her
disappointed
face
he
went
out
immediately
without
even
going
upstairs
first
ben
and
kathleen
were
now
alone
kathleen
looked
at
him
attentively
i
wonder
she
said
slowly
what
are
you
staring
at
me
for
said
ben
i
have
been
wondering
what
sort
you
are
i
have
got
cousins
at
home
and
they
do
anything
in
the
world
i
like
i
wonder
if
you
would
ben
had
been
very
cross
with
kathleen
when
she
had
knocked
to
him
and
david
from
the
window
but
he
was
not
cross
now
he
was
only
thirteen
and
up
to
the
present
no
pretty
girl
had
ever
taken
the
slightest
notice
of
him
he
was
a
plain
boy
with
a
freckled
face
a
wide
mouth
and
blue
eyes
you
make
me
laugh
whenever
i
look
at
you
was
kathleen
next
candid
remark
i
did
know
that
i
was
so
comical
was
his
answer
perhaps
you
do
like
it
i
ca
say
i
do
well
this
is
the
palace
of
home
truths
said
kathleen
laughing
i
asked
your
darling
saintly
sister
just
now
which
was
the
most
wicked
to
tell
a
polite
lie
or
a
frightfully
rude
home
truth
she
said
that
a
polite
lie
was
an
awful
sin
so
in
this
house
i
must
cleave
to
the
home
truths
i
could
tell
you
you
know
that
you
have
quite
a
fascinating
smile
and
a
very
taking
voice
and
a
delightful
and
polished
manner
but
i
prefer
to
tell
you
that
you
are
comical
which
means
that
i
feel
inclined
to
burst
out
laughing
whenever
i
look
at
you
thank
you
said
ben
who
could
be
very
sulky
when
he
liked
then
i
will
take
my
objectionable
presence
out
of
your
sight
i
have
got
my
lessons
to
do
kathleen
raised
her
brows
and
gave
a
slow
smile
ben
got
as
far
as
the
door
benny
she
said
then
in
a
most
seductive
whisper
he
turned
i
am
so
glad
you
are
in
i
should
not
have
thought
so
but
i
am
it
is
awfully
lonely
for
a
girl
like
me
who
has
got
dozens
of
cousins
at
home
and
uncles
and
aunts
and
all
the
rest
of
the
goodly
fry
to
be
stranded
i
like
david
i
am
quite
smitten
with
david
and
i
like
you
too
you
can
be
a
friend
of
mine
oh
i
do
mind
said
ben
he
thought
it
would
be
very
good
fun
to
tell
the
other
fellows
about
the
charming
irish
girl
who
liked
him
so
much
i
wonder
if
you
help
me
ben
what
can
i
do
asked
ben
sit
down
and
let
be
cozy
i
will
sit
in
the
tired
one
chair
and
you
can
sit
on
that
little
stool
at
my
feet
now
is
that
nice
who
do
you
mean
by
the
tired
one
your
mother
silly
boy
of
course
it
is
a
very
ridiculous
name
to
call
her
it
belongs
to
the
palace
of
home
truths
your
mother
is
tired
and
you
you
lazy
omadhauns
well
go
on
said
ben
i
see
by
your
manner
that
you
want
me
to
do
something
i
suppose
it
something
a
little
bit
a
little
bit
not
quite
good
it
is
perfectly
good
i
love
you
ever
so
much
if
you
will
do
it
what
is
it
i
am
going
out
this
evening
i
may
not
be
in
until
late
if
the
others
are
in
bed
will
you
come
and
unlock
the
door
for
me
when
i
throw
gravel
up
at
your
window
you
must
tell
me
which
is
your
window
i
sleep
in
the
north
attic
it
does
look
out
on
to
the
street
and
i
ca
i
ca
possibly
do
it
you
can
come
down
and
wait
for
me
in
the
hall
how
can
i
when
the
tired
one
goes
to
bed
you
can
come
down
she
goes
to
bed
at
ten
i
know
and
i
shall
not
be
in
until
about
ten
i
want
dave
to
know
well
because
i
do
i
do
want
alice
to
know
because
i
dislike
alice
very
much
really
kathleen
you
ought
not
to
speak
like
that
well
i
do
and
i
ca
help
myself
will
you
do
what
i
want
here
do
you
think
you
like
this
in
your
possession
as
kathleen
spoke
she
held
out
a
golden
sovereign
in
the
palm
of
her
little
hand
i
do
want
to
be
bribed
it
is
bribery
really
it
is
paying
you
for
giving
me
a
great
convenience
i
must
go
out
on
important
business
i
want
to
help
those
who
are
and
distressed
will
you
do
what
i
want
ben
will
you
dear
ben
you
know
i
like
you
so
much
will
you
will
you
of
course
ben
fought
against
kathleen
rather
wicked
suggestion
of
course
in
the
end
he
yielded
when
he
finally
got
up
to
his
attic
to
thumb
over
his
he
had
kathleen
golden
sovereign
in
his
pocket
he
took
it
out
and
looked
at
it
he
turned
it
round
and
round
and
examined
it
all
over
he
rubbed
it
lovingly
against
his
freckled
cheek
held
it
until
it
got
warm
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
then
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
and
jingled
it
against
a
couple
of
pennies
which
were
its
only
companions
a
whole
sovereign
he
said
to
himself
a
whole
sovereign
and
i
never
had
so
much
as
five
shillings
of
my
own
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
well
she
is
a
little
witch
i
suppose
dave
would
beat
me
black
and
blue
for
doing
a
thing
of
this
sort
but
how
could
i
how
could
i
withstand
her
supper
at
the
tennants
generally
consisted
of
cold
pudding
cold
meat
and
a
little
jam
when
there
happened
to
be
any
in
the
house
it
was
not
a
particularly
tempting
meal
and
those
who
ate
it
required
to
have
good
vigorous
appetites
kathleen
although
she
had
been
brought
up
in
a
considerable
amount
of
wasteful
splendor
was
indifferent
to
what
she
ate
she
soon
jumped
up
and
walked
across
the
little
passage
into
the
ben
looking
very
red
and
shamefaced
would
not
meet
her
eyes
ben
face
annoyed
kathleen
it
did
not
occur
to
her
for
a
minute
that
he
would
not
be
faithful
to
her
but
she
was
afraid
that
others
might
notice
his
extraordinary
and
perturbed
expression
once
too
he
jingled
the
sovereign
in
his
pocket
she
heard
him
and
wondered
why
david
did
not
ask
him
where
he
had
got
the
money
but
no
remark
was
made
and
the
meal
came
safely
to
an
end
kathleen
took
up
the
first
book
she
could
find
and
pretended
to
read
i
shall
feign
sleepiness
at
a
quarter
to
nine
she
said
to
herself
and
go
upstairs
i
shall
be
awfully
polite
and
sweet
to
dear
alice
she
never
comes
to
bed
before
ten
so
i
shall
be
quite
safe
getting
out
of
the
house
i
can
drop
from
the
window
but
i
should
prefer
going
by
the
back
door
and
i
do
think
maria
will
betray
me
just
then
alice
strolled
into
the
room
she
looked
rather
nice
she
wore
a
very
pretty
pink
muslin
blouse
which
suited
her
well
her
hair
was
neatly
arranged
her
face
was
calm
she
stood
before
kathleen
i
wish
she
said
suddenly
kathleen
raised
her
head
and
i
wish
you
would
stand
between
me
and
the
lamp
do
you
see
that
i
am
reading
i
want
you
to
stop
reading
i
have
something
to
say
indeed
kathleen
longed
to
be
very
rude
but
she
thought
of
her
delightful
plan
so
close
at
hand
and
refrained
i
must
humor
her
if
i
can
by
any
possibility
keep
my
temper
was
her
thought
then
aloud
what
is
it
you
want
i
hope
you
will
be
very
quick
for
i
am
rather
sleepy
and
intend
to
go
to
bed
soon
i
hope
you
wo
do
it
again
that
all
do
what
again
asked
kathleen
spend
your
money
on
buying
food
for
us
we
are
not
so
poor
as
all
that
my
mother
is
paid
by
your
father
to
give
you
your
meals
your
father
does
expect
you
to
buy
them
over
again
dad
always
likes
me
to
do
what
i
wish
replied
kathleen
calmly
well
do
do
it
again
it
extremely
displeasing
both
to
david
and
me
kathleen
laughed
dave
gobbled
up
his
sausage
and
his
sardines
she
said
do
do
it
again
that
all
kathleen
nodded
her
head
and
again
buried
herself
in
her
book
and
there
is
another
thing
continued
alice
dropping
into
a
chair
by
kathleen
side
you
are
very
low
down
in
the
school
two
of
the
mistresses
spoke
to
me
about
you
they
do
like
to
see
a
great
overgrown
girl
like
you
in
a
class
with
little
children
it
does
neither
you
nor
the
school
credit
they
fear
that
during
this
term
you
may
be
forced
to
continue
in
your
present
low
position
but
they
earnestly
hope
that
you
will
work
very
hard
so
as
to
be
removed
into
a
higher
form
you
ought
after
christmas
to
get
into
a
class
at
least
two
removes
higher
up
in
the
school
that
is
what
i
came
to
say
i
suppose
you
have
a
certain
sense
of
honor
and
you
do
want
your
father
money
to
be
thrown
away
bedad
then
he
has
plenty
of
money
and
i
do
much
care
replied
kathleen
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
and
whistled
garry
owen
in
a
most
insolent
manner
if
you
have
really
made
up
your
mind
not
to
improve
yourself
in
the
very
least
mother
had
better
write
to
squire
and
suggest
that
you
do
come
back
after
christmas
and
squire
will
decide
that
point
for
himself
replied
kathleen
there
are
other
houses
where
i
can
be
entertained
and
fussed
over
and
regarded
as
i
ought
to
be
regarded
besides
the
home
of
alice
tennant
the
fact
is
this
alice
you
aggravate
me
you
do
understand
me
i
am
at
my
worst
in
your
presence
perhaps
i
am
a
bit
wild
sometimes
but
your
way
would
never
drive
me
to
work
or
anything
else
i
have
no
real
dislike
to
learning
and
if
another
girl
spoke
to
me
as
you
have
done
i
might
be
very
glad
what
do
you
mean
said
poor
alice
i
really
and
truly
kathleen
do
want
to
help
you
you
and
i
could
work
every
evening
together
i
could
and
would
see
you
through
your
lessons
thus
you
would
very
quickly
get
to
the
head
of
your
class
and
get
your
removes
without
trouble
at
christmas
i
suppose
you
mean
to
be
kind
said
kathleen
i
will
think
it
over
let
me
alone
now
she
gave
a
portentous
yawn
ben
heard
her
came
and
sat
down
on
an
ottoman
not
far
off
and
began
kicking
his
legs
benny
said
his
sister
if
you
have
done
your
lessons
you
had
better
go
to
bed
i
do
want
to
go
so
early
you
always
treat
me
as
if
i
were
a
baby
well
please
yourself

upstairs
to
fetch
my
books
i
have
a
good
hour
and
a
half
of
hard
work
to
get
through
before
bedtime
the
moment
kathleen
and
ben
were
alone
ben
rushed
up
to
her
side
and
began
to
whisper
it
is
all
as
right
as
possible
he
said
i
am
going
up
to
bed
as
usual
and
when
mother
and
alice
and
dave
are
safe
in
their
rooms

again
i

in
the
hall

when

up
the
steps
and
scratch
against
the
door
with
your
knuckles
and
i
hear
you
and
let
you
in
in
a
trice
i
am
awfully
pleased
about
that
sovereign
it
will
make
me
one
of
the
greatest
toffs
in
the
school
i
have
more
money
than
any
of
the
other
fellows
i
so
excited
i
can
scarcely
think
of
anything
else
i
know
i
doing
wrong
but
you
did
offer
me
such
a
tremendous
temptation
now
i
hear
alice
step
it
will
be
all
right
kathleen
do
you
fear
kathleen
smiled
to
herself
the
rest
of
her
programme
was
carried
out
to
a
nicety
at
a
quarter
to
nine
she
complained
of
fatigue
bade
tennant
an
affectionate
nodded
to
alice
and
left
the
room
be
sure
you
do
lock
the
door
called
alice
after
her
i
be
up
for
quite
an
hour
and
you
will
be
sound
asleep
by
that
time
i
wo
lock
it
replied
kathleen
gently
when
kathleen
had
gone
upstairs
tennant
turned
and
spoke
to
her
daughter
you
know
alice
she
said
the
child
is
very
lovable
and
a
little
barbarian
in
some
senses
of
the
word
but
a
fine
nature
of
that
i
am
certain
i
am
so
busy
mother
replied
alice
ca
we
defer
talking
of
the
charms
of
kathleen
character
until
after
i
have
done
my
lessons
of
course
dear
said
her
mother
she
drew
her
basket
of
mending
towards
her
put
stitch
after
stitch
into
the
shabby
garments
and
thought
all
the
time
of
kathleen
with
her
bright
face
and
beautiful
merry
eyes
meanwhile
that
young
lady
having
arranged
a
bolster
in
her
bed
to
look
as
like
a
human
being
as
possible
put
on
her
hat
and
jacket
and
ran
downstairs
there
was
no
one
in
the
hall
and
she
was
absolutely
daring
enough
to
go
out
by
that
door
tennant
raised
her
head
when
she
heard
the
door
gently
shut
can
that
be
the
post
she
said
but
as
no
one
replied
she
forgot
the
circumstance
and
went
on
with
her
mending
a
few
doors
down
the
street
susy
hopkins
was
waiting
for
kathleen
oh
there
you
are
she
said
we
are
so
excited
there
will
be
about
eight
of
us
waiting
for
you
in
the
old
quarry
you
are
good
to
come
you
do
know
what
this
means
in
our
lives
you
are
good
you
are
wonderfully
good
where
the
quarry
asked
kathleen
you
have
chosen
such
a
funny
place
i
should
not
have
imagined
that
a
quarry
a
dear
romantic
quarry
could
be
found
anywhere
in
this
neighborhood
yes
but
there
is
and
a
good
big
one
too
it
is
about
half
a
mile
away
just
at
the
back
of
colliers
buildings
it
is
the
safest
place
you
can
possibly
imagine
for
no
one
will
ever
look
for
us
there
now
do
be
quick
we
will
find
the
others
before
us
you
ca
think
how
excited
we
are
oh
i
willing
to
be
quick
replied
kathleen
i
am
doing
all
this
for
you
you
know
because
i
am
sorry
for
the
foundationers
and
think
it
so
very
ridiculous
that
there
should
be
distinctions
made
why
you
are
quite
as
good
as
the
others
they
are
none
of
them
much
to
boast
of
what
fun
this
is
cried
susy
again
i
assure
you
the
paying
girls
think
no
end
of
themselves
they
are
under
the
supposition
that
there
never
were
such
fine
ladies
to
be
found
in
the
land
before
oh
we
will
take
it
out
of
them
we
kathleen
made
no
reply
presently
they
reached
the
opening
that
led
into
the
quarry
they
had
to
go
down
a
narrow
sloping
path
and
then
by
a
doorway
cut
in
the
solid
rock
after
they
had
passed
through
they
found
themselves
in
a
large
circular
cavern
open
to
the
sky
there
was
no
moon
and
the
night
was
dark
but
one
girl
had
brought
a
lantern
she
opened
it
and
placed
it
on
the
ground
a
bright
shaft
of
light
now
fell
on
several
young
figures
all
huddled
together
susy
gave
a
sharp
whistle
the
girls
started
to
their
feet
here
we
are
girls
see
this
is
our
queen
and
she
presented
kathleen
to
the
assembled
girls
does
the
queen
mind
our
looking
at
her
face
in
turns
said
kate
rourke
i
have
not
specially
noticed
you
before
she
continued
but
after
we
have
each
had
a
good
stare
we
will
know
what
sort
of
girl
you
are
for
reply
kathleen
herself
lifted
the
lantern
and
flung
the
full
light
upon
her
radiant
and
lovely
face
and
figure
the
intense
light
made
her
golden
hair
shine
and
brought
out
the
delicate
perfection
of
each
feature
the
merry
eyes
framed
in
their
dark
lashes
the
gleaming
white
teeth
the
rosy
lips
were
all
apparent
but
beyond
the
mere
beauty
of
feature
kathleen
had
to
a
remarkable
degree
the
far
more
fascinating
beauty
of
expression
her
face
was
capable
of
almost
every
shade
of
emotion
being
sorrowful
and
pathetic
one
moment
and
brimful
of
irrepressible
mirth
and
roguery
the
next
there
was
a
silence
amongst
the
girls
until
mary
rand
shouted
hip
hip
hurrah
the
whole
eight
immediately
broke
into
a
ringing
cheer
welcome
queen
kathleen
they
said
welcome
and
they
held
out
their
hands
and
clasped
the
hands
of
the
irish
girl
i
am
glad
said
kathleen
what
about
said
clara
sawyer
why
you
have
crowned
me
queen
yourselves
now
i
can
do
what
i
like
with
you
all
you
certainly
can
said
susy
we
are
devoted
to
our
queen
are
we
girls
we
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
on
the
spot
said
rosy
myers
i
never
saw
any
one
quite
so
lovely
before
as
the
queen
said
mary
rand
it
is
only
that
she
lovely
she
is
so
genteel
said
susy
hopkins
aristocratic
cried
hannah
johnson
you
have
given
your
opinion
and
ruth
craven
you
have
given
yours
i
reserve
my
opinion
said
ruth
and
i
say
there
a
great
deal
of
humbug
and
in
the
world
said
hannah
johnson
ruth
remark
was
unexpected
but
the
girls
hannah
who
was
hannah
johnson
that
she
dared
to
speak
so
rudely
to
one
so
charming
and
beautiful
as
kathleen
there
was
a
disconcerting
pause
and
then
kathleen
said
hannah
doubtless
you
are
right
there
is
plenty
of
humbug
in
the
world
but
i
do
think
i
am
one
now
the
question
is
shall
i
be
on
the
side
of
the
foundationers
or
shall
i
be
on
the
side
of
the
paying
girls
in
the
great
shirley
school
indeed
darling
said
rosy
myers
you
shall
be
on
our
side
those
horrid
paying
girls
do
want
you
and
we
do
nothing
will
induce
us
to
give
you
up
it
is
a
chance
to
get
a
girl
like
you
so
lovely
and
so
sweet
and
so
rich
to
be
one
of
us
well
i
think
i
can
give
you
a
good
time
and
i
can
show
those
others
with
their
snobbish
ways
hear
hear
cried
the
excited
girls
i
can
show
the
others
what
i
think
of
them
they
wo
snub
me
but
perhaps
i
shall
snub
them
well
girls
as
we
have
decided
to
band
together
we
must
draw
up
rules
and
when
they
are
drawn
up
we
must
obey
them
i
of
course
will
be
your
head
as
you
have
made
me
queen
that
is
the
natural
thing
to
expect
of
course
said
susy
kathleen
clapped
her
hands
this
is
going
to
be
a
real
good
secret
society
she
said
what
fun
it
all
will
be
the
girls
laughed
and
clustered
with
more
and
more
friendliness
round
kathleen
you
are
our
queen
said
kate
there
are
eight
of
us
here
and
we
all
swear
allegiance
to
do
we
girls
certainly
said
susy
unquestionably
remarked
mary
with
all
my
heart
said
rose
and
mine
echoed
clara
and
mine
said
kate
i
will
join
the
others
although
i
do
approve
said
hannah
johnson
with
a
somewhat
unwilling
nod
and
i
am
neutral
i
do
think
i
ought
to
join
at
all
said
ruth
oh
yes
you
will
ruth
i
want
you
to
be
my
prime
minister
i
want
you
to
be
with
me
in
all
things
i
do
know
that
i
can
and
why
should
she
be
your
prime
minister
said
kate
in
an
ugly
voice
she
no
better
than
the
others
and
she
very
new
some
of
us
have
been
at
the
school
for
some
time
ruth
craven
has
only
just
joined
the
queen
must
have
her
way
said
kathleen
stamping
her
foot
the
queen
must
have
her
way
in
all
particulars
and
she
wishes
to
elect
ruth
craven
as
her
prime
minister
that
is
if
ruth
will
consent
they
were
headstrong
and
big
girls
most
of
them
older
than
kathleen
but
they
submitted
for
her
ways
were
masterful
and
her
tone
full
of
delicate
sympathy
i
will
think
it
over
and
let
you
know
said
ruth
of
course
i
shall
not
betray
you
but
you
must
please
understand
that
i
have
friends
amongst
the
paying
girls
of
the
school
cassandra
weldon
is
my
friend
and
there
are
others
i
will
not
join
nor
advocate
any
plan
that
annoys
or
worries
them
the
girls
looked
dubious
and
one
or
two
began
to
speak
in
discontented
voices
we
must
meet
again
in
a
couple
of
days
said
kathleen
finally
by
then
i
shall
have
drawn
up
the
rules
we
ca
always
meet
at
night
but
we
will
when
it
is
possible
for
this
place
is
so
romantic
and
so
correct
for
a
secret
society
those
who
are
present
will
be
in
my
cabinet
i
should
like
if
possible
to
have
all
the
foundation
girls
on
my
side
but
that
must
be
decided
at
our
next
meeting
i
am
willing
to
purchase
a
badge
for
each
girl
who
joins
me
it
will
be
made
of
silver
and
can
be
worn
beneath
the
dress
in
the
form
of
a
locket
oh
lovely
delicious
there
never
was
such
a
queen
cried
susy
hopkins
the
little
meeting
broke
up
amidst
universal
applause
chapter
viii
the
box
from
dublin
and
its
treasures
kathleen
returned
quite
safely
to
myrtle
lodge
ben
was
sitting
up
for
her
he
opened
the
door
the
hall
was
quite
dark
he
held
out
his
hand
and
drew
her
in
am
not
i
splendid
he
said
i
have
been
standing
here
for
all
drenched
with
perspiration
if
mother
came
down
what
would
she
say
and
as
to
alice
she
be
even
worse
but
a
sov
worth
doing
something
for
i
say
i
do
feel
happy
i
never
had
all
that
lot
of
bullion
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
before
are
you
right
now
kathleen
can
you
slip
upstairs
without
making
any
noise
do
forget
that
the
step
just
before
you
reach
the
upper
landing
gives
a
great
creak
like
the
report
of
a
pistol
hop
over
it
on
to
the
landing
itself
and
you
are
safe
alice
is
in
bed
snoring
like
anything
i
listened
outside
the
keyhole
thanks
said
kathleen
i
awfully
obliged
to
you
ben
see
if
i
do
do
something
for
you
you
are
a
broth
of
a
boy
what
do
you
say
to
carrigrohane
in
the
summer
and
a
gun
all
to
yourself
i
teach
you
how
to
shoot
rabbits
and
to
bring
down
a
bird
on
the
wing
she
brushed
her
lips
against
his
cheek
and
ran
lightly
upstairs
she
escaped
the
treacherous
second
step
and
entered
her
bedroom
without
waking
alice
the
bolster
carefully
manipulated
had
done
its
work
it
had
never
occurred
to
alice
that
the
form
in
the
bed
was
anything
but
the
living
form
of
kathleen
she
had
shaded
the
light
from
what
she
supposed
to
be
the
sleeping
girl
and
got
into
bed
herself
feeling
tired
and
sulky
she
had
dropped
asleep
immediately
kathleen
first
step
therefore
towards
the
formation
of
a
secret
society
in
the
great
shirley
school
was
marked
with
success
the
idea
which
she
had
formulated
in
the
old
quarry
spread
like
wildfire
amongst
the
foundationers
but
kathleen
was
determined
not
to
have
another
meeting
for
nearly
a
week
she
wished
to
hear
from
her
father
she
wanted
to
have
money
in
hand
they
are
all
poor
she
thought
if
i
appear
just
as
poor
as
they
are
i
shall
never
be
able
to
keep
my
exalted
position
as
queen
we
can
not
have
our
next
meeting
until
i
have
drawn
up
the
rules
and
i
should
like
ruth
craven
to
help
me
she
has
got
sense
i
do
want
the
thing
to
be
riotous
nor
to
do
harm
in
any
way
i
just
want
us
to
have
a
bit
of
fun
and
to
teach
the
horrid
paying
girls
of
the
school
a
lesson
the
thought
of
her
secret
society
kept
kathleen
in
a
fairly
good
humor
and
she
worked
at
her
lessons
so
well
that
alice
began
to
have
hopes
of
her
about
a
week
after
her
arrival
at
myrtle
lodge
the
box
which
aunt
katie
was
sending
from
dublin
arrived
it
came
when
the
girls
were
at
school
when
they
returned
to
early
dinner
they
saw
it
standing
in
the
front
hall
whatever
is
this
and
why
is
it
put
here
said
alice
springing
forward
to
look
at
the
address
miss
kathleen
care
of
tennant
myrtle
lodge
golloptious
cried
kathleen
it
my
own
it
my
clothes
my
sort
of
a
kind
of
a
treasure
oh
what
delicious
fun
now
you
will
see
how
smart
i
can
be
maybe
there
will
be
something
here
to
fit
you
alice
would
you
like
it
we
are
going
to
tea
to
weldon
and
ruth
craven
is
to
be
there
the
darling
girl
i
will
give
her
something
i
should
love
to
make
her
look
just
as
beautiful
as
she
can
look
i
am
not
a
bit
a
stingy
sort
of
girl
you
know
that
alice
i
want
to
be
quite
generous
with
my
lovely
things
well
do
stop
talking
said
alice
i
never
came
across
such
an
inveterate
chatterbox
i
suppose
you
like
to
have
the
box
taken
up
to
our
room
but
i
do
think
you
have
any
time
to
open
it
at
present
you
have
promised
to
come
back
with
me
to
the
school
this
afternoon
in
order
that
miss
spicer
may
give
you
a
special
lesson
in
music
arrah
then
my
dear
cried
kathleen
it
is
me
you
see
at
school
again
it
gloating
and
fussing
over
my
clothes
i
will
be
portioning
out
those
i
mean
to
give
to
others
and
trying
on
the
ones
that
will
suit
me
you
can
go
to
your
horrid
stupid
lessons
if
you
like
but
it
wo
be
kathleen
who
will
accompany
you
perhaps
the
poor
tired
one
would
like
to
have
a
pleasant
afternoon
in
my
bedroom
oh
glory
be
to
goodness
we
will
have
a
time
is
it
worth
anything
to
see
that
blessed
trunk
my
eyes
can
almost
pierce
through
the
deal
and
see
the
lovely
garments
folded
away
inside
alice
took
no
notice
she
marched
on
to
her
room
kathleen
followed
her
the
boys
shall
bring
it
up
for
me
immediately
after
dinner
she
said
i
be
going
out
again
until
i
go
to
weldon
i
expect
people
will
open
their
eyes
when
they
see
me
you
must
please
yourself
of
course
said
alice
for
my
part
i
am
extremely
sorry
that
the
trunk
has
come
you
were
settling
down
a
little
and
were
not
quite
so
objectionable
as
at
first
thanks
darling
said
kathleen
dropping
a
mock
curtsy
not
quite
so
objectionable
continued
alice
in
a
calm
voice
but
now
with
all
these
silly
gewgaws
you
will
be
worse
titan
ever
but
please
clearly
understand
that
i
do
not
want
any
of
your
ornaments
do
trouble
yourself
darling
they
were
not
made
for
you
i
force
my
treasures
on
nobody
i
would
wear
them
if
you
were
to
give
them
i
hope
i
have
some
proper
pride
pride
of
the
proper
sort
said
kathleen
dancing
before
her
and
i
do
hope
also
that
you
wo
make
yourself
a
or
a
figure
of
fun
at
the
weldons
it
will
be
in
extremely
bad
taste
we
are
not
going
to
have
a
large
party
just
one
or
two
of
the
mistresses
and
little
ruth
craven
who
although
she
is
a
foundationer
seems
to
be
a
very
nice
sort
of
child
it
would
be
in
the
worst
taste
possible
to
wear
anything
but
the
simplest
clothes
all
right
said
kathleen
if
i
am
a
chatterbox
you
are
about
the
greatest
preacher
with
the
most
sermons
that
ever
entered
a
house
you
are
a
perfect
plague
to
me
and
that
is
the
truth
alice
tennant
alice
poured
some
water
into
her
basin
washed
her
hands
and
went
downstairs
mother
she
said
i
am
obliged
to
be
out
the
whole
afternoon
the
scholarship
examination
takes
place
in
six
weeks
now
and
if
i
am
to
have
any
chance
of
getting
through
i
must
not
idle
a
single
moment
i
grieve
to
say
that
a
box
of
finery
has
arrived
for
kathleen
most
unsuitable
for
she
has
plenty
of
clothes
i
do
trust
mother
you
will
keep
her
in
tow
a
little
this
afternoon
and
not
allow
her
to
make
a
show
of
herself
you
are
not
very
kind
to
kathleen
said
tennant
why
the
child
enjoy
her
pretty
things
i
like
to
see
girls
nicely
dressed
it
is
a
great
trial
to
me
to
be
obliged
to
deny
you
the
ribbons
and
frills
and
laces
which
most
girls
of
your
age
possess
thanks
mother
answered
alice
but
if
you
were
as
rich
as
croesus
i
should
not
wish
while
i
am
a
schoolgirl
to
dress
any
better
than
i
do
you
certainly
have
a
great
deal
of
sense
dear
but
do
be
too
hard
on
the
little
girl
ah
here
she
comes
now
we
must
sit
down
to
dinner
at
once
during
dinner
kathleen
eyes
sparkled
so
brightly
and
she
looked
so
merry
and
mysterious
that
both
the
boys
gazed
at
her
in
wonder
do
mind
me
she
said
whispering
to
david
as
she
bent
towards
him
it
in
real
downright
delight
i
am
i
am
expecting
to
have
the
most
wonderful
joy
all
the
afternoon
that
was
ever
given
a
girl
ah
then
it
illegant
myself
will
be
when
you
see
me
next
boys
and
do
look
at
her
i
declare
she
getting
crosser
each
minute
hush
kathleen
said
david
you
must
not
say
unkind
things
do
trouble
to
reprove
her
david
called
out
alice
in
a
calm
and
lofty
tone
i
assure
you
she
does
annoy
me
in
the
least
sometimes
i
think
there
is
a
little
gnat
flying
about
and
trying
to
sting
me
but
that
all
and
a
charming
metaphor
too
said
kathleen
she
ate
her
meal
soberly
but
occasionally
a
bubble
of
laughter
came
to
the
surface
and
her
merry
eyes
glanced
from
tennant
face
to
alice
and
from
alice
to
those
of
the
boys
the
moment
the
meal
came
to
an
end
kathleen
jumped
up
now
then
my
angels
you
come
with
me
she
said
and
she
caught
david
by
the
one
hand
and
ben
by
the
other
and
led
her
willing
slaves
into
the
hall
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
it
said
alice
to
her
mother
she
will
ruin
the
boys
in
addition
to
all
her
other
mischief
mother
must
we
keep
her
long
it
is
really
most
disturbing
if
you
would
only
take
poor
little
kathleen
as
she
is
you
would
find
her
quite
agreeable
alice
was
her
mother
answer
oh
dear
mother
you
seem
to
be
just
as
much
infatuated
as
the
others
but
never
mind
i
am
off
now
and
i
need
not
be
back
in
the
house
until
it
is
time
to
dress
to
go
to
weldon
i
declare
that
girl
is
causing
me
to
hate
my
home
i
do
think
its
fair
whatever
you
may
say
to
the
contrary
tennant
sighed
alice
had
always
been
a
little
difficult
she
was
more
than
difficult
at
the
present
moment
but
very
soon
afterwards
the
welcome
bang
of
the
hall
door
was
heard
and
the
house
was
free
now
for
a
jolly
time
said
kathleen
tired
one
where
are
you
kathleen
you
ought
not
to
call
me
by
that
name
you
ought
to
be
more
respectful
arrah
then
darling
i
ca
in
me
i
am
so
fond
of
you
oh
worra
worra
there
nothing
i
would
do
for
you
but
i
must
be
as
i
made
you
do
look
tired
and
tired
you
will
go
on
looking
until
i
take
you
to
carrigrohane
to
rest
you
and
to
feed
you
with
good
milk
and
good
fruit
and
good
eggs
and
good
now
then
boys
lift
up
that
trunk
be
aisy
with
it
so
that
you
wo
hurt
it
take
it
up
to
my
bedroom
and
put
it
on
the
floor
maybe
there
something
in
it
for
you
or
maybe
there
is
tennant
acushla
you
will
come
along
upstairs
with
me
at
once
you
can
bring
your
mending
basket
and
i
will
pop
you
into
the
by
the
window
and
we
can
consult
together
over
the
garments
it
fine
i
look
when
i
have
them
on
aunt
katie
is
a
woman
who
has
real
taste
and
i
know
she
is
going
to
dress
me
up
as
no
other
girl
ever
was
dressed
before
in
the
great
shirley
school
tennant
could
not
help
laughing
the
boys
were
also
in
the
highest
kathleen
mirth
was
contagious
they
went
upstairs
to
the
bedroom
and
then
ben
saucily
perched
himself
on
the
foot
of
one
of
the
beds
while
david
having
brought
up
a
hammer
and
screwdriver
proceeded
to
lift
the
lid
of
the
box
which
was
firmly
nailed
down
under
the
lid
was
a
lot
of
kathleen
went
on
her
knees
lifted
it
up
uttered
a
shout
and
turned
to
the
boys
you
make
off
now
she
said
no
indeed
i
wo
said
ben
i
want
to
see
the
fun
go
both
of
you
there
will
be
something
nice
for
you
when
you
come
back
to
tea
said
kathleen
they
looked
regretful
but
saw
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
kathleen
in
a
breathless
sort
of
way
scarcely
uttering
a
word
spread
out
her
treasures
on
the
bed
was
there
ever
such
a
box
skirts
bodices
blouses
shirts
an
evening
dress
an
afternoon
dress
a
morning
dress
they
seemed
simply
endless
then
there
were
frills
and
ribbons
and
veils
there
were
two
great
big
very
hats
with
long
plumes
and
there
was
a
little
toque
made
of
crimson
velvet
which
kathleen
declared
was
quite
too
sweet
for
anything
there
were
also
dozens
of
handkerchiefs
dozens
of
pairs
of
stockings
and
some
sweet
little
slippers
all
embroidered
and
fit
for
the
most
bewitching
feet
in
the
world
kathleen
cheeks
got
redder
and
redder
here
a
cargo
for
you
she
said
here
something
to
delight
the
heart
now
my
dear
tennant
let
us
come
and
examine
everything
do
you
think
i
am
utterly
selfish
tennant
do
you
think
i
want
all
these
things
for
myself
i
am
sure
you
do
dear
it
quite
makes
me
ache
with
longing
to
give
some
of
them
away
i
want
so
many
frocks
there
are
a
good
dozen
here
all
told
aunt
katie
the
one
for
extravagance
bless
her
and
for
having
a
thing
done
in
style
bless
her
i
should
like
you
to
see
her
splendacious
she
is
entirely
when
she
dressed
up
in
her
best
velvet
and
feathers
and
laces
and
jewels
why
nothing
holds
her
in
bounds
there
nothing
she
stops
at
i
have
seen
her
give
hundreds
of
pounds
for
one
little
glittering
gem
ah
and
here
a
ring
look
mrs
tennant
kathleen
had
now
opened
a
small
box
which
was
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
great
trunk
there
were
several
treasures
in
it
a
necklet
of
glittering
white
stones
another
of
blue
another
of
red
and
this
little
ring
a
little
ring
which
contained
a
solitary
diamond
of
the
purest
water
now
i
shall
look
stylish
said
kathleen
and
she
slipped
the
ring
on
the
third
finger
of
her
left
hand
my
wedding
finger
too
bedad
she
said
when
the
contents
of
the
trunk
had
been
finally
explored
kathleen
began
to
sort
her
finery
tennant
gave
advice
some
of
these
things
are
a
little
too
fine
for
everyday
use
she
said
but
some
of
these
blouses
are
very
suitable
and
so
are
these
white
and
gray
and
pink
shirts
and
this
blue
bodice
is
quite
nice
for
the
evening
and
so
is
the
skirt
belonging
to
it
but
this
and
this
and
this
i
would
wear
these
until
i
went
home
if
i
were
you
my
love
kathleen
glanced
at
her
a
slight
frown
came
between
her
brows
do
you
see
she
said
impatiently
that
i
want
to
give
away
some
of
these
things
do
you
see
this
dozen
of
blouses
all
exactly
alike
in
this
box
these
are
for
the
secret
society
the
what
kathleen
oh
you
mus
tell
it
is
the
most
profound
secret
but
i
have
joined
one
being
an
irish
girl
it
is
quite
natural
i
sent
a
line
to
aunt
katie
to
get
a
dozen
of
the
very
prettiest
blouses
she
could
of
course
there
are
a
lot
more
members
but
our
cabinet
has
risen
to
something
like
a
dozen
so
i
thought
i
have
them
handy
are
they
just
sweet
as
she
spoke
she
took
out
of
the
box
the
palest
blue
cashmere
blouse
most
exquisitely
trimmed
with
blue
embroidery
flecked
with
pink
silk
the
blouse
had
real
lace
round
the
neck
and
cuffs
and
must
have
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
do
you
think
alice
would
look
very
nice
in
one
of
these
said
kathleen
gazing
with
a
very
earnest
face
at
tennant
pink
is
more
alice
color
she
is
too
pale
for
blue
was
tennant
reply
well
then
look
here
is
this
a
perfect
duck
see
for
yourself
it
a
sort
of
cross
between
a
coral
and
a
rose
oh
so
exquisite
and
see
how
it
is
made
with
all
these
teeny
tucks
and
the
embroidery
let
in
between
and
the
sleeves
are
they
just
illegant
entirely
do
you
think
we
might
make
her
wear
it
i
am
sorry
kathleen
but
you
are
not
getting
on
very
well
with
alice
i
wish
it
were
different
could
you
not
do
something
to
propitiate
her
wisha
then
darling
said
kathleen
pausing
a
moment
to
consider
that
just
what
i
ca
do
alice
ways
are
not
my
ways
and
if
i
copied
her
it
kilt
i
be
entirely
she
never
likes
to
see
a
smile
on
my
face
and
she
ca
abide
to
watch
me
if
i
dance
a
step
and
she
would
take
a
joke
out
of
me
if
it
was
to
save
her
life
to
please
alice
i
have
to
be
the
primmest
of
the
prim
and
always
stooping
over
my
horrid
lessons
and
the
end
of
it
there
be
no
more
of
poor
kathleen
it
dead
and
in
her
grave
she
be
the
creature
indeed
glad
i
not
made
on
alice
pattern
even
if
she
is
your
daughter
i
ca
aspire
to
anything
so
fine
and
high
up
even
for
your
sake
darling
and
you
are
one
of
the
sweetest
women
on
god
earth
i
could
do
it
not
by
no
means
tennant
could
not
help
laughing
as
kathleen
described
the
sort
of
girl
she
would
be
if
she
adopted
alice
role
but
the
question
is
now
said
the
girl
what
are
we
to
do
to
make
her
have
some
of
these
pretty
things
might
i
give
the
blouse
to
you
first
and
you
could
give
it
to
her
she
look
so
sweet
in
this
pink
blouse
when
she
went
to
tea
at
her
chosen
friends
she
be
almost
pretty
if
she
was
nicely
dressed
i
got
this
white
one
for
little
ruth
craven
and
i
want
alice
to
have
this
so
badly
ca
you
manage
it
dear
mrs
tennant
tennant
felt
tempted
the
blouse
was
very
dainty
and
pretty
and
unlike
anything
she
could
afford
to
buy
for
her
only
daughter
kathleen
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
kissed
her
you
will
you
will
dear
tennant
she
said
it
is
yours
entirely
you
tell
her
you
got
it
at
a
cheap
sale
say
you
went
to
a
jumble
sale
and
bought
it
you
paid
for
it
that
the
right
figure
is
it
for
the
best
things
at
a
jumble
sale
tell
her
it
new
and
was
thrown
in
promiscuous
like
but
my
darling
child
i
ca
tell
her
what
is
true
she
would
wear
it
if
she
did
know
it
came
from
you
she
would
not
only
wear
it
but
she
would
delight
in
it
but
nothing
would
induce
her
to
take
it
if
she
thought
you
had
given
it
then
do
let
tell
her
besides
it
would
be
true
for
i
have
given
it
to
you
dear
and
now
see
here
is
something
for
your
sweet
self
i
wrote
to
aunt
katie
and
aunt
katie
is
so
clever
see
come
to
the
glass
kathleen
had
opened
a
cardboard
box
and
out
of
it
she
took
a
black
velvet
bonnet
with
nodding
plumes
and
a
little
pink
strip
of
velvet
fastened
under
the
brim
this
she
put
with
trembling
fingers
on
tennant
head
tennant
was
in
reality
not
at
all
old
and
she
looked
quite
young
and
pretty
in
the
new
toque
you
are
charming
that
what
you
are
said
kathleen
and
i
take
it
back
for
you
know
perfectly
well
that
it
is
a
wee
bit
too
old
for
me
you
will
have
to
wear
it
but
what
will
alice
say
never
mind
do
tell
her
just
be
mum
say
is
mine
and
i
mean
to
wear
it
oh
i
manage
alice
if
i
happened
to
be
her
mother
i
do
think
you
would
dear
indeed
but
i
would
and
now
i
must
consider
whom
i
am
to
give
the
other
things
to
when
kathleen
had
finally
parcelled
out
her
treasures
there
was
not
such
a
great
deal
left
for
herself
for
this
girl
and
the
other
who
had
taken
her
fancy
were
all
allotted
a
treasure
out
of
that
famous
box
and
there
was
a
thick
albert
chain
made
of
solid
silver
for
ben
and
a
keyless
silver
watch
for
david
and
what
could
boys
possibly
want
more
kathleen
had
remembered
all
her
friends
and
aunt
katie
was
more
than
willing
to
carry
out
her
request
finally
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
trunk
was
a
little
parcel
which
she
refrained
from
opening
while
tennant
was
present
it
contained
the
badges
of
the
new
society
kathleen
had
decided
that
they
were
to
call
themselves
the
wild
irish
girls
and
this
title
was
neatly
engraved
on
the
little
badges
which
were
of
the
shape
of
hearts
below
the
name
was
the
device
a
harp
with
a
bit
of
shamrock
trailing
round
it
the
badges
were
small
and
exceedingly
neat
and
there
were
about
sixty
of
them
in
all
now
then
i
can
go
ahead
thought
kathleen
what
with
the
finery
for
my
dear
darling
chosen
ones
and
the
badges
for
all
the
members
i
shall
do
she
was
utterly
reckless
with
regard
to
expense
her
father
was
rich
and
he
did
not
mind
what
he
spent
on
his
only
child
the
box
seemed
to
fill
up
every
crevice
of
her
heart
as
she
expressed
it
and
it
was
a
very
happy
girl
who
dressed
to
go
to
the
weldons
that
evening
kathleen
was
intensely
affectionate
and
would
have
done
anything
in
the
world
to
please
tennant
but
when
it
came
to
wearing
a
very
quiet
gray
dress
with
a
little
lace
round
the
collar
and
cuffs
she
begun
to
demur
it
ca
be
done
she
thought
half
of
them
will
be
in
gray
and
half
of
them
in
brown
and
a
few
old
dowdies
will
perhaps
be
in
black
but
i
must
be
gay
it
is
fair
to
aunt
katie
to
be
anything
else
she
made
a
wild
and
scarcely
judicious
selection
she
put
on
crimson
silk
stockings
and
tucked
into
her
bag
a
pair
of
crimson
satin
shoes
her
dress
consisted
of
a
black
velvet
skirt
over
a
crimson
petticoat
and
her
bodice
was
of
crimson
silk
very
much
embroidered
and
with
round
her
neck
she
wore
innumerable
beads
of
every
possible
color
and
twisted
through
her
lovely
hair
were
some
more
beads
which
shone
as
the
light
fell
on
them
altogether
it
was
a
very
bizarre
and
fascinating
little
figure
that
appeared
that
evening
at
the
weldons
hall
door
over
her
showy
dress
she
wore
a
long
so
that
at
first
her
splendors
were
not
fully
visible
this
gaily
dressed
little
person
entered
a
room
full
of
sober
people
the
effect
was
somewhat
the
same
as
though
a
gorgeous
butterfly
had
flown
into
the
room
she
lit
up
the
dullness
and
made
a
centre
of
attraction
all
eyes
were
fastened
upon
her
for
kathleen
in
her
dress
notwithstanding
the
gayety
of
its
color
looked
simply
radiant
the
mischief
in
her
dark
eyes
too
but
added
to
her
charm
she
glanced
with
almost
maliciousness
at
alice
who
in
the
dowdiest
of
dresses
with
her
hair
rather
untidy
and
her
face
destitute
of
color
was
standing
near
one
of
the
windows
and
as
alice
glanced
at
kathleen
she
felt
that
she
almost
hated
the
irish
girl
chapter
ix
conscience
and
difficulties
all
the
people
who
knew
her
were
beginning
to
make
a
fuss
over
ruth
craven
she
who
had
hardly
ever
been
noticed
during
the
early
part
of
her
life
who
was
just
her
grandfather
darling
and
her
idol
was
now
petted
and
made
much
of
and
fussed
over
by
every
one
it
was
quite
an
extraordinary
thing
for
the
paying
girls
of
the
great
shirley
school
to
be
so
interested
and
excited
about
a
foundationer
cassandra
weldon
was
not
the
only
girl
who
had
taken
ruth
up
some
of
the
best
and
nicest
girls
of
the
school
began
to
patronize
her
the
fact
was
that
she
was
very
modest
and
a
perfect
lady
and
it
was
impossible
to
feel
anything
but
towards
her
the
rest
of
the
foundation
girls
at
first
determined
that
they
would
leave
her
with
her
fine
friends
but
when
kathleen
insisted
on
ruth
joining
the
secret
society
of
the
wild
irish
girls
they
were
obliged
to
submit
we
do
anything
in
the
world
for
our
queen
said
susy
hopkins
talking
to
another
foundation
girl
one
day
as
they
strolled
along
the
road
it
is
we
are
to
meet
again
and
she
says
she
will
bring
the
rules
all
drawn
up
and
she
will
read
them
to
us
there
are
about
thirty
of
us
now
and
more
and
more
offer
to
join
every
day
the
difficulty
is
that
we
have
got
to
keep
the
thing
from
the
knowledge
of
the
teachers
and
the
paying
girls
of
the
school
kathleen
is
certain
that
it
would
be
suppressed
if
it
were
known
and
it
must
not
be
known
for
it
is
the
biggest
lark
and
the
greatest
fun
we
ever
had
in
all
our
lives
yes
said
rosy
myers
i
feel
now
quite
honored
at
being
a
foundation
girl
she
does
promise
us
wonderful
things
said
kate
rourke
she
says
when
the
summer
comes
we
shall
have
all
sorts
of
nice
excursions
of
course
we
ca
do
anything
special
in
the
daytime
unless
sometimes
on
saturday
when
we
have
a
whole
holiday
but
at
least
she
says
the
nights
are
our
own
and
we
can
do
as
we
like
it
really
is
grand
i
suppose
it
is
wicked
but
then
that
makes
it
rather
more
fascinating
we
are
in
the
queen
cabinet
bless
her
the
duck
said
susy
hopkins
there
are
a
dozen
of
us
now
and
there
is
talk
of
a
sort
of
livery
or
badge
for
the
members
of
the
cabinet
but
we
know
all
about
it
when
we
meet
sharp
at
nine
we
are
the
twelve
members
of
the
cabinet
and
there
are
about
twenty
girls
who
are
our
sort
of
standing
army
it
is
really
most
exciting
the
girls
talked
a
little
longer
and
then
parted
as
susy
hopkins
was
running
home
for
she
wanted
to
get
her
lessons
done
in
order
to
be
fully
in
time
for
the
meeting
that
evening
she
met
ruth
craven
ruth
was
walking
slowly
by
with
her
usual
demure
and
sweet
expression
hullo
called
out
susy
we
meet
we
i
do
know
said
ruth
are
you
coming
why
you
are
sort
of
prime
minister
to
the
queen
you
do
think
it
right
really
do
you
said
ruth
not
from
the
bottom
of
your
heart
i
mean
right
or
wrong
i
mean
to
enjoy
myself
said
susy
hopkins
i
suppose
if
you
come
to
analyse
it
it
is
wrong
and
not
right
but
dear
me
ruth
what
fun
should
we
poor
girls
have
if
we
were
too
particular
on
these
points
it
always
seems
to
me
that
it
is
worth
while
to
do
right
said
ruth
so
you
say
but
i
do
quite
agree
with
you
you
will
come
in
any
case
wo
you
yes
i
will
come
but
i
am
not
happy
about
it
and
i
wish
kathleen
oh
i
know
it
is
very
fascinating
and
kathleen
is
just
delightful
but
i
should
not
like
our
teachers
to
know
of
course
not
said
susy
staring
at
her
they
soon
put
a
stop
to
it
are
you
certain
i
know
so
little
about
the
school
certain
i
convinced
why
they
be
furious
i
expect
we
be
expelled
then
that
proves
it
i
did
know
there
was
any
strict
rule
about
it
why
what
are
you
made
of
ruth
craven
i
thought
said
ruth
that
when
we
were
not
in
school
we
were
our
own
mistresses
to
a
certain
extent
of
course
but
we
have
what
is
called
the
school
character
to
keep
up
we
have
as
it
were
to
uphold
the
spirit
of
the
school
now
the
spirit
of
the
school
is
quite
against
secrecy
in
any
form
oh
dear
why
will
you
drag
all
this
out
of
me
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
think
of
it
and
now
you
have
forced
me
to
say
it
of
course
you
will
come
you
have
to
think
of
kathleen
as
well
as
the
school
and
she
gone
to
a
fearful
lot
of
expense
you
could
not
by
any
possibility
forsake
her
could
you
no
of
course
not
said
ruth
very
slowly
she
bade
susy
and
walked
on
her
attitude
was
that
of
one
who
was
thinking
hard
ruth
is
very
pretty
said
susy
to
herself
but
i
do
know
that
i
quite
admire
her
she
is
the
sort
of
girl
that
everybody
loves
and
i
am
not
one
to
admire
a
universal
favorite
she
is
frightfully
tiresomely
good
and
she
just
pretty
and
she
not
a
bit
vain
and
not
a
bit
puffed
up
oh
she
is
just
right
in
every
way
and
yet
i
feel
that
i
hate
her
she
has
got
the
sort
of
conscience
that
will
worry
our
queen
to
distraction
still
once
she
joins
she
have
to
obey
our
rules
and
i
expect
our
queen
will
make
them
somewhat
stringent
a
clock
from
a
neighboring
church
struck
the
susy
looked
up
uttered
an
exclamation
put
wings
to
her
feet
and
ran
the
rest
of
the
way
home
susy
home
was
in
the
high
street
of
the
little
town
of
merrifield
her
mother
kept
a
fairly
flourishing
stationer
shop
in
one
part
of
which
was
a
some
ladies
were
buying
stamps
as
susy
dashed
through
the
shop
on
her
way
to
the
family
rooms
at
the
back
hopkins
was
selling
stationery
to
a
couple
of
boys
she
looked
up
as
her
daughter
entered
susy
went
into
the
parlor
where
tea
was
laid
on
the
table
it
consisted
of
a
stale
loaf
some
indifferent
butter
and
a
little
jam
the
tea
in
a
pewter
teapot
was
weak
the
milk
was
and
the
jug
that
held
it
was
cracked
susy
poured
out
a
cup
of
tea
drank
it
off
at
a
gulp
snatched
a
piece
of
from
the
plate
and
sat
down
to
prepare
her
lessons
at
another
table
she
had
two
hours
hard
work
before
her
and
it
was
already
nearly
six
the
quarry
was
a
little
distance
away
and
she
must
tidy
herself
and
do
all
sorts
of
things
just
then
her
mother
came
in
oh
susy
she
said
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
i
want
you
to
attend
to
the
shop
for
the
next
hour
i
am
sent
for
in
a
hurry
to
my
sister
she
has
a
bad
cold
and
wants
me
to
call
in
i
think
little
peter
is
not
well
your
aunt
is
afraid
he
is
catching
measles
run
into
the
shop
the
moment
you
have
finished
your
tea
like
a
good
child
you
can
take
one
of
your
with
you
if
you
like
there
wo
be
many
customers
at
this
hour
oh
mother
i
did
really
want
to
work
hard
at
my
lessons
they
are
very
difficult
you
know
and
you
promised
that
when
i
went
to
the
great
shirley
school
you
never
interfere
with
my
lesson
hours
i
did
say
so
and
of
course
i
do
mean
to
interfere
but
this
is
a
special
case
ca
tommy
go
and
stand
in
the
shop
if
any
special
customers
come
in
i
will
attend
to
them
no
tommy
ca
he
has
a
headache
and
is
lying
down
upstairs
you
must
oblige
me
this
time
susy
you
can
sit
up
a
little
longer
to
finish
your
lessons
if
you
are
much
interrupted
while
i
am
away
you
are
sure
you
will
not
be
more
than
an
hour
mother
oh
certain
and
i
suppose
in
any
case
i
may
shut
up
the
shop
at
seven
may
i
shut
the
shop
at
seven
said
hopkins
you
forget
that
this
is
wednesday
we
always
keep
the
shop
except
the
part
open
until
past
nine
on
wednesdays
such
a
lot
of
people
come
in
for
odds
and
ends
on
this
special
night
but
i
will
be
back
long
before
nine
do
on
any
account
shut
the
shop
until
i
appear
susy
feeling
cross
and
miserable
all
her
bright
hopes
dashed
to
the
ground
took
a
couple
of
books
and
went
into
the
shop
and
sat
behind
the
counter
the
days
were
getting
short
and
cold
and
as
the
shop
door
was
opened
there
was
a
thorough
draught
where
she
was
sitting
her
feet
grew
icy
cold
she
could
scarcely
follow
the
meaning
of
her
somewhat
difficult
lessons
no
customers
appeared
how
stupid
i
am
thought
the
little
girl
this
will
never
do
she
roused
herself
and
bending
forward
propped
her
book
open
before
her
presently
she
heard
the
clock
outside
strike
seven
mother
will
be
back
now
thank
goodness
she
thought
if
i
work
desperately
hard
and
stop
my
ears
so
that
i
need
hear
a
sound
i
may
have
done
by
nine
just
at
that
moment
two
ladies
came
in
to
ask
for
a
special
sort
of
stationery
susy
who
was
never
in
the
least
interested
in
the
shop
did
not
know
where
to
find
it
she
rummaged
about
making
a
great
mess
amongst
her
mother
neat
stores
and
finally
she
was
obliged
to
say
that
she
did
not
know
where
it
was
never
mind
said
one
of
the
ladies
kindly
i
will
come
in
again
next
time
i
am
passing
it
does
matter
this
evening
susy
felt
vexed
she
knew
her
mother
would
blame
her
for
sending
the
ladies
away
without
completing
a
purchase
and
they
had
scarcely
left
before
she
found
the
box
which
contained
the
stationery
she
pushed
it
out
of
sight
on
the
shelf
and
sat
down
again
to
her
book
her
mother
ought
to
be
coming
in
now
susy
would
have
to
do
a
lot
of
exercises
these
she
could
not
by
any
possibility
do
in
the
shop
she
had
also
some
mathematical
work
to
get
through
or
she
would
never
be
able
to
keep
her
place
in
class
why
did
hopkins
return
went
by
it
was
now
a
quarter
to
eight
susy
felt
quite
distracted
with
the
exception
of
the
two
ladies
there
had
been
no
customer
in
the
shop
up
to
the
present
the
fact
was
they
did
not
begin
to
appear
until
soon
after
eight
on
wednesday
evenings
then
the
schoolgirls
and
schoolboys
and
many
other
people
of
the
poorer
class
used
to
drop
in
for
and
of
stationery
for
pens
for
ink
for
mother
must
be
in
soon
i
know
what
i
will
do
said
susy
i
will
open
the
door
of
the
parlor
and
sit
there
if
any
one
appears
i
can
dash
out
at
once
no
sooner
had
the
thought
come
to
her
than
she
resolved
to
act
on
it
she
turned
on
the
gas
in
the
parlor
it
was
already
brightly
lighted
in
the
shop
and
sat
down
to
her
work
an
hour
and
a
quarter
before
the
meeting
of
the
wild
irish
girls
she
said
to
herself
strange
is
it
not
that
i
should
call
myself
a
wild
irish
girl
when
i
am
a
cockney
through
and
through
well
whatever
happens
i
shall
be
at
the
meeting
chapter
x
the
wild
irish
girls
society
is
started
while
susy
sat
in
the
parlor
a
tramp
happened
to
pass
the
brightly
lighted
shop
he
was
and
slipshod
and
altogether
made
a
most
disreputable
appearance
a
hand
was
thrust
into
each
of
his
pockets
and
these
pockets
were
destitute
of
coin
the
tramp
was
hungry
and
penniless
the
little
shop
with
its
gay
light
and
tempting
articles
of
stationery
and
books
and
displayed
in
the
window
were
quite
to
the
man
taste
he
could
not
see
the
parlor
beyond
nor
the
where
susy
was
supposed
to
be
able
to
watch
the
shop
he
only
noticed
that
no
one
was
within
the
tramp
was
in
the
humor
to
do
something
desperate
he
entered
the
shop
under
the
pretense
of
begging
made
straight
for
the
till
pulled
it
open
and
took
out
a
handful
of
money
he
had
no
time
to
count
his
spoils
but
leaving
the
still
open
he
dashed
out
of
the
shop
now
it
so
happened
that
susy
just
when
the
tramp
stole
in
had
gone
upstairs
to
fetch
a
fresh
she
noticed
nothing
amiss
on
her
return
and
went
tranquilly
on
with
her
work
eight
struck
susy
was
in
despair
i
ca
possibly
fail
kathleen
she
said
to
herself
she
started
this
splendid
idea
in
order
to
help
me
and
give
me
pleasure
i
must
be
at
the
quarry
whatever
happens
something
very
unusual
is
detaining
mother
i
know
what
i
do
i
shut
up
the
shop
at
eight
leave
a
little
note
for
mother
and
then
go
to
the
quarry
as
fast
as
i
can
i
will
tell
mother
that
i
am
due
at
an
important
meeting
and
she
is
sure
not
to
question
me
mother
is
always
very
kind
and
gives
me
as
much
liberty
as
she
can
susy
made
a
great
struggle
to
keep
her
mind
centered
on
her
books
but
with
all
her
efforts
her
thoughts
would
wander
they
wandered
to
kathleen
and
the
wild
irish
girls
society
they
wandered
to
her
other
schoolfellows
they
wandered
to
the
hardship
of
having
to
take
care
of
the
shop
when
she
wished
to
be
otherwise
employed
and
finally
they
settled
themselves
on
ruth
craven
she
could
not
help
wondering
what
ruth
would
do
whether
she
would
continue
to
be
a
valuable
aid
to
the
queen
of
the
new
society
or
whether
she
would
give
them
up
altogether
i
almost
like
her
not
to
stay
with
us
thought
susy
for
then
perhaps
kathleen
would
make
me
her
prime
minister
i
like
that
kathleen
is
the
dearest
truest
greatest
lady
i
ever
came
across
she
does
think
anything
of
birth
nor
of
those
sort
of
tiresome
distinctions
she
thinks
of
you
for
what
you
are
worth
yourself
and
she
is
so
splendid
to
look
at
and
has
such
a
gallant
sort
of
way
i
do
admire
her
just
the
rang
susy
was
out
in
a
moment
a
woman
had
called
for
a
of
paper
and
an
envelope
she
put
down
her
penny
on
the
counter
and
susy
supplied
her
from
a
special
box
i
was
in
such
a
taking
said
the
woman
i
just
remembered
at
the
last
moment
that
all
the
shops
were
shut
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
if
i
had
recalled
that
hopkins
kept
hers
open
until
nine
i
am
obliged
to
you
little
girl
i
have
to
send
this
letter
to
my
son
in
india
and
i
miss
the
mail
if
it
was
posted
you
could
now
i
suppose
oblige
me
with
a
stamp
of
course
i
can
said
susy
cheerfully
mother
always
keeps
a
supply
of
stamps
in
the
till
she
turned
to
the
till
as
she
spoke
and
for
the
first
time
noticed
that
the
drawer
was
open
how
careless
of
me
not
to
have
shut
it
she
thought
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
examine
its
contents
or
to
suppose
for
a
single
moment
that
any
one
had
taken
money
out
of
it
she
provided
the
woman
with
a
stamp
and
then
shut
the
drawer
of
the
till
it
was
now
eight
and
susy
determined
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
to
close
the
shop
without
further
ado
she
sent
for
the
little
maid
in
the
kitchen
to
put
up
the
shutters
and
in
a
minute
or
two
the
shop
was
in
darkness
and
susy
was
racing
through
the
remainder
of
her
lessons
it
would
take
her
a
quarter
of
an
hour
running
most
of
the
way
to
reach
the
old
quarry
and
she
must
have
three
or
four
minutes
to
dress
she
stood
up
therefore
at
her
work
in
order
as
she
expressed
it
to
save
time
she
was
so
occupied
when
her
mother
came
in
why
have
you
shut
the
shop
said
hopkins
in
an
annoyed
voice
it
is
only
a
very
little
past
eight
and
i
saw
two
poor
women
outside
they
wanted
a
of
paper
each
they
said
thought
you
always
kept
open
until
nine
now
it
will
spread
all
over
the
place
that
i
shut
at
eight
why
did
you
do
it
susy
hard
enough
to
make
ends
meet
without
adding
any
more
difficulties
hopkins
stood
looking
very
pale
and
perplexed
in
the
parlor
susy
glanced
at
her
mother
and
could
not
help
reflecting
that
the
poor
woman
was
fit
to
drop
do
sit
down
mother
she
said
i
was
so
distracted
i
have
to
be
a
good
way
from
here
at
nine
i
could
think
whatever
kept
you
i
was
obliged
to
shut
the
shop
i
am
sorry
well
never
mind
you
did
tell
me
that
you
were
going
out
i
wish
you
would
go
out
so
much
in
the
evening
susy
it
does
make
it
so
hard
for
me
there
no
one
now
to
help
me
with
a
bit
of
mending
and
all
your
things
are
getting
so
racketed
through
what
kept
you
mother
said
susy
ignoring
her
mother
speech
oh
it
was
your
aunt
she
in
such
a
taking
about
little
peter
quite
certain
he
in
for
measles
or
something
worse
i
persuaded
that
it
nothing
but
a
cold
i
never
saw
such
a
woman
as
your
aunt
bessie
she
had
a
thing
handy
in
the
place
i
had
to
stay
and
see
the
doctor
and
then
to
fetch
the
medicine
myself
and
then
put
the
child
to
bed
i
assure
you
i
have
sat
down
since
i
left
and
i
suppose
she
never
thought
of
giving
you
as
much
as
a
cup
of
tea
said
susy
no
answered
her
mother
then
catching
sight
of
the
teapot
she
added
you
might
have
had
the
removed
susy
i
will
make
myself
a
fresh
cup
susy
stood
still
for
a
moment
temptation
tugged
at
her
heart
her
mother
certainly
required
if
ever
a
mother
did
require
a
daughter
but
the
wild
irish
girls
surely
they
were
pining
for
her
in
the
distance
i
wish
i
could
help
you
mother
i
would
if
i
had
promised
to
go
out
if
you
will
give
me
the
latchkey
i
can
let
myself
in
you
wait
up
i
promise
to
lock
up
carefully
very
well
dear
said
hopkins
she
did
not
reproach
susy
that
was
not
her
way
she
put
a
little
kettle
on
the
fetched
a
clean
cup
and
saucer
and
presently
sat
down
to
her
belated
meal
susy
dashed
upstairs
she
put
on
her
hat
and
jacket
snatched
up
a
pair
of
gloves
and
the
next
moment
was
out
of
the
house
free
at
last
she
thought
but
oh
what
an
evening
i
have
had
i
must
say
it
is
horrid
to
be
poor
now
if
i
was
rich
like
kathleen
would
i
have
a
gay
time
of
it
poor
dear
mother
should
drive
in
a
carriage
and
i
ride
on
my
pony
by
her
side
and
tom
should
be
a
public
school
boy
there
be
no
horrid
shop
then
and
no
horrid
women
coming
in
for
and
of
paper
but
as
she
ran
through
the
autumn
she
felt
that
after
all
there
was
something
good
in
life
her
pulses
which
had
been
languid
enough
in
the
stuffy
little
parlor
at
the
back
of
the
shop
now
galloped
fiercely
she
arrived
two
or
three
minutes
after
nine
but
still
in
fairly
good
time
to
see
a
number
of
dark
heads
surrounding
a
bright
light
this
light
was
caused
by
two
lamps
which
had
been
placed
on
the
ground
in
the
old
quarry
kathleen
had
brought
them
herself
in
a
hamper
she
had
managed
to
buy
them
that
day
and
had
smuggled
them
off
without
any
one
being
the
wiser
a
large
bottle
of
crystalline
oil
accompanied
the
lamps
kathleen
who
had
dressed
lamps
for
pleasure
at
home
knew
quite
well
how
to
manage
them
and
when
susy
appeared
they
stood
at
each
end
of
a
wide
patch
of
light
kathleen
herself
was
in
the
midst
of
the
light
and
the
other
girls
clustered
round
the
edge
is
it
scrumptious
said
kate
oh
is
that
you
susy
hopkins
you
are
late
yes
i
know
i
am
it
a
wonder
i
could
come
at
all
said
susy
ruth
craven
has
come
yet
said
another
voice
yes
here
she
is
cried
a
third
and
ruth
came
and
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
patch
of
light
kathleen
flung
off
her
hat
and
the
light
from
the
lamps
lit
up
her
brilliant
hair
her
cheeks
were
flaming
with
color
and
her
very
eyes
looked
as
black
as
night
she
faced
her
companions
well
she
said
here
we
are
and
we
call
ourselves
the
wild
irish
girls
i
really
wonder
if
you
english
girls
who
are
assembled
here
in
the
old
quarry
have
the
least
idea
what
it
means
to
be
a
wild
irish
girl
if
you
do
know
i
like
to
tell
you
yes
do
tell
us
cried
several
the
principal
thing
that
it
means
continued
kathleen
raising
her
voice
to
a
slightly
theatrical
pitch
and
extending
her
arm
so
that
the
lamplight
fell
all
over
it
the
chief
thing
that
it
means
is
to
be
free
yes
free
as
the
air
free
as
the
mountain
streams
free
as
the
dear
darling
glorious
everlasting
mountains
themselves
oh
to
know
freedom
and
then
to
be
torn
away
from
it
girls
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
i
feel
in
your
dull
old
england
as
though
i
were
in
prison
yes
that
about
it
i
do
like
england
i
want
you
girls
to
join
me
in
loving
ireland
but
we
ca
hate
england
said
kate
rourke
that
is
quite
impossible
if
ireland
is
your
native
land
england
is
ours
and
we
can
not
help
loving
her
very
very
much
you
have
never
known
ireland
continued
kathleen
you
are
not
cramped
up
in
that
favored
spot
you
are
allowed
to
get
up
when
you
like
and
to
go
to
bed
when
you
like
to
eat
what
you
like
to
read
what
books
you
like
to
row
on
the
lake
to
shoot
in
the
bogs
to
gallop
on
your
pony
over
the
moors
and
and
oh
to
live
the
life
of
the
it
was
ruth
craven
who
now
interrupted
the
eager
words
of
the
queen
of
the
new
society
ca
you
tell
us
kathleen
she
said
how
to
get
ireland
into
england
how
to
introduce
what
is
good
of
ireland
into
england
that
is
the
use
of
the
society
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
with
the
exception
of
yourself
we
are
all
english
girls
yes
said
susy
suddenly
and
we
have
very
bad
times
most
of
us
i
wish
you
knew
what
a
dull
evening
i
have
just
been
living
through
taking
care
of
a
tiny
very
dull
little
shop
mother
was
out
looking
after
a
sick
child
and
i
had
to
mind
the
shop
poor
women
came
in
for
of
paper
i
can
tell
you
there
was
much
freedom
about
that
it
was
all
horrid
well
we
have
shops
in
ireland
too
continued
kathleen
and
i
suppose
people
have
to
mind
them
but
what
i
want
to
say
now
is
this
i
have
been
sent
over
to
this
country
to
learn
my
aunt
katie
she
the
finest
figure
of
a
woman
you
ever
laid
eyes
on
thought
that
i
ought
to
have
learning
mother
thought
so
too
but
the
dad
did
much
care
however
i
need
worry
you
about
that
i
have
been
sent
here
and
here
i
am
when
i
came
to
your
wonderful
school
and
looked
all
around
me
i
said
to
myself
i
not
to
have
companions
why
i
die
the
heart
of
kathleen
will
be
broken
now
who
amongst
the
schoolgirls
will
suit
me
i
saw
that
very
dull
cassandra
weldon
and
i
noticed
a
few
companions
of
hers
who
were
much
the
same
sort
then
i
observed
dear
pretty
little
ruth
craven
and
some
one
said
to
me
wo
take
much
notice
of
ruth
for
she
only
a
foundation
girl
that
made
me
mad
oh
yes
it
did
give
me
your
hand
that
made
my
whole
heart
go
out
to
ruth
then
i
was
told
that
a
lot
of
the
girls
were
foundation
girls
and
they
were
as
rich
as
the
others
and
they
were
somewhat
snubbed
so
i
thought
time
has
come
i
am
an
irish
girl
and
the
heritage
of
every
irish
girl
handed
down
to
her
from
a
long
line
of
ancestors
is
to
help
the
oppressed
so
now
i
am
going
to
help
all
of
you
and
we
are
going
to
found
this
society
and
we
are
going
to
have
a
good
time
kathleen
somewhat
incoherent
speech
was
received
with
shouts
of
applause
we
must
make
a
few
rules
she
continued
when
her
young
companions
had
ceased
to
shout
just
a
few
big
rules
which
will
be
quite
easy
for
all
of
us
to
obey
certainly
said
kate
and
i
have
brought
a
with
me
and
if
you
will
dictate
them
kathleen
i
will
jot
them
down
that
is
easy
enough
said
kathleen
well
i
am
queen
certainly
you
are
who
else
could
be
of
course
you
are
queen
darling
dear
sweet
duck
fell
from
various
pairs
of
lips
thank
you
said
kathleen
looking
round
at
them
her
eyes
becoming
dewy
with
a
sudden
emotion
i
think
she
added
i
love
you
all
already
and
there
is
nothing
on
earth
i
would
do
for
you
hear
her
the
dear
she
is
bringing
a
fine
change
into
our
lives
cried
a
mass
of
girls
who
stood
a
little
out
of
the
line
of
light
well
said
kathleen
i
am
queen
and
i
have
my
cabinet
now
the
girls
of
my
cabinet
are
the
following
ruth
craven
is
my
prime
minister
kate
rourke
comes
next
in
importance
then
follow
susy
hopkins
clara
sawyer
hannah
johnson
rosy
myers
and
mary
rand
now
all
of
you
girls
whom
i
have
named
are
expected
to
uphold
order
such
order
as
is
alone
necessary
for
the
wild
irish
girls
you
are
expected
on
all
occasions
to
uphold
the
authority
of
me
your
queen
you
are
never
under
any
circumstances
to
breathe
a
word
against
dear
old
ireland
the
other
girls
who
join
the
society
will
be
looked
after
by
you
you
will
instruct
them
in
our
rules
and
you
will
help
them
to
be
good
members
of
a
most
important
society
i
believe
there
are
a
great
many
girls
willing
to
join
if
so
will
they
hold
up
their
hands
immediately
a
great
show
of
hands
was
visible
now
kate
rourke
cried
kathleen
please
take
down
the
names
of
the
girls
who
intend
to
become
members
of
the
wild
irish
girls
the
girls
came
forward
one
by
one
and
kate
took
down
their
names
and
it
was
quickly
discovered
that
out
of
the
hundred
foundationers
who
belonged
to
the
great
shirley
school
sixty
had
joined
society
we
shall
soon
get
the
remaining
forty
said
mary
rand
they
will
be
all
agog
to
come
on
their
positions
are
not
so
very
pleasant
as
it
is
poor
things
perhaps
sixty
are
about
as
many
as
we
can
manage
for
the
present
said
kathleen
now
girls
i
intend
to
present
you
each
with
a
tiny
badge
i
have
a
bag
full
of
them
here
will
you
each
come
forward
and
accept
the
badge
of
membership
kathleen
badges
were
very
much
admired
the
eager
girls
bending
down
towards
the
light
of
the
lamps
in
order
to
examine
them
more
thoroughly
she
had
strung
narrow
green
ribbon
through
each
of
the
little
silver
hearts
and
the
girls
could
therefore
slip
them
over
their
heads
at
once
you
must
hide
them
said
kathleen
the
thing
about
these
badges
is
that
you
will
always
feel
them
pressing
against
your
hearts
and
nobody
else
will
know
anything
about
them
they
belong
to
ireland
and
to
me
to
the
home
of
the
free
and
to
kathleen
they
seal
you
as
my
loving
friends
and
followers
for
ever
and
ever
girls
are
easily
impressed
and
kathleen
words
were
so
fervent
that
some
of
them
felt
quite
choky
about
the
throat
they
received
their
badges
with
hands
that
very
nearly
trembled
kathleen
next
handed
a
slightly
handsomer
badge
but
with
exactly
the
same
device
to
the
members
of
her
cabinet
finally
she
took
the
box
of
cashmere
blouses
and
opened
it
in
the
light
of
the
lamps
the
enthusiasm
which
had
been
extremely
keen
before
the
appearance
of
the
blouses
now
rose
to
whom
were
these
exquisite
creations
meant
for
kathleen
smiled
as
she
handed
one
to
mary
rand
another
to
ruth
craven
another
to
kate
rourke
and
finally
to
each
member
of
her
cabinet
i
wish
i
could
give
you
all
a
blouse
apiece
she
said
to
the
other
girls
of
the
society
but
i
am
afraid
that
is
not
within
my
means
i
chose
these
sweet
blouses
on
purpose
because
i
know
you
could
wear
them
at
any
time
girls
she
added
turning
to
the
members
of
her
cabinet
outsiders
wo
know
they
will
wonder
at
the
beauty
of
your
dress
but
they
wo
know
what
it
means
but
will
know
she
shouted
aloud
to
her
companions
we
will
know
that
these
girls
belong
to
us
and
to
old
ireland
and
in
particular
to
me
and
they
will
be
faithful
to
me
as
their
queen
oh
dear
said
little
alice
harding
a
girl
who
loved
fine
dress
and
never
could
aspire
to
it
what
means
can
i
take
to
become
a
member
of
the
cabinet
by
being
a
very
good
outside
member
and
trusting
to
your
luck
laughed
kathleen
but
the
time
is
passing
and
we
must
proceed
to
what
little
business
is
left
for
each
member
of
the
cabinet
took
possession
of
her
own
blouse
wrapped
it
up
tenderly
and
tucked
it
under
her
arm
kathleen
desired
some
one
to
throw
the
box
away
and
then
she
collected
her
followers
round
her
now
she
said
rule
to
stick
through
thick
and
thin
each
to
the
other
yes
cried
every
voice
rule
if
possible
never
to
quarrel
each
with
the
other
this
rule
also
was
received
with
acclamations
rule
to
have
a
bit
of
fun
all
to
ourselves
at
least
once
a
week
this
rule
quite
brought
down
the
house
they
shouted
so
loud
that
if
the
spot
had
been
less
lonely
some
one
would
certainly
have
taken
cognizance
of
their
proceedings
rule
that
as
far
as
possible
we
hold
ourselves
aloof
from
the
paying
members
of
the
great
shirley
school
this
rule
was
not
quite
as
enthusiastically
received
the
foundationers
were
not
altogether
without
friends
amongst
the
other
girls
of
the
school
ruth
craven
in
particular
had
several
i
do
think
that
is
a
very
fair
rule
she
said
i
am
fond
of
alice
tennant
and
i
am
fond
of
cassandra
weldon
and
i
care
for
lucy
sharp
and
i
am
devoted
to
amelia
dawson
said
other
members
of
the
cabinet
nevertheless
kathleen
was
firm
the
rule
must
be
held
she
said
in
a
society
like
ours
there
are
always
rules
which
are
not
quite
agreeable
to
every
one
my
principal
object
in
starting
this
society
is
to
put
those
horrid
paying
girls
in
their
proper
places
there
must
not
be
friendship
not
real
friendship
i
mean
between
us
and
them
you
are
a
paying
girl
yourself
suddenly
exclaimed
mary
rand
i
know
i
wish
i
were
not
but
i
ca
help
myself
you
must
allow
me
to
stand
alone
i
am
your
queen
that
you
are
and
i
love
you
said
mary
this
rule
must
hold
good
repeated
kathleen
i
must
insist
on
my
society
adhering
to
ruth
craven
why
are
you
silent
because
i
earnestly
wish
i
had
not
joined
i
can
not
give
up
cassandra
nor
alice
nor
nor
other
girls
nonsense
ruth
you
dare
not
fail
me
now
said
kathleen
with
enthusiasm
i
will
make
it
up
to
you
you
shall
come
with
me
to
ireland
in
the
summer
you
shall
oh
ruth
do
fail
me
i
wo
but
i
hate
that
rule
and
girls
i
think
we
must
part
now
said
kate
rourke
it
is
getting
late
and
it
would
never
do
for
our
secret
meetings
to
be
discovered
whatever
happens
we
must
stick
together
said
kathleen
well
we
meet
again
this
day
week
there
was
quite
a
flutter
of
excitement
along
that
lonely
road
as
the
wild
irish
girls
returned
to
their
different
homes
susy
hopkins
felt
quite
the
happiest
and
most
of
any
she
and
ruth
craven
found
themselves
the
only
girls
who
were
walking
down
the
road
called
southwood
lane
this
road
led
right
into
the
centre
of
the
shops
where
susy
mother
lived
what
a
good
thing
said
susy
that
i
took
the
latchkey
with
me
it
is
past
ten
mother
would
be
wild
if
she
had
to
sit
up
so
late
ruth
was
silent
are
you
happy
ruthie
do
you
think
it
is
all
splendid
cried
susy
yes
and
no
said
ruth
you
see
i
am
a
foundationer
and
when
she
pressed
me
to
join
i
hated
not
to
but
now
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
joined
what
am
i
to
do
about
cassandra
and
about
alice
you
think
a
great
deal
about
cassandra
do
you
oh
yes
she
is
quite
a
splendid
girl
and
she
has
been
so
very
good
to
me
i
suppose
you
are
quite
in
love
with
her
no
i
do
think
i
am
it
is
my
way
to
fall
violently
in
love
with
girls
like
some
of
the
rest
of
you
but
i
like
her
and
i
like
alice
tennant
all
the
same
said
susy
it
is
worth
sacrificing
a
little
thing
to
belong
to
the
wild
irish
girls
did
you
ever
in
all
your
life
see
any
one
look
more
splendid
than
kathleen
as
she
stood
with
the
light
of
those
big
lamps
upon
her
she
is
a
wonderful
girl
so
graceful
and
with
such
a
power
of
eloquence
and
she
has
such
a
way
of
just
taking
you
by
storm
and
her
language
is
so
poetic
oh
i
adore
her
she
is
the
sort
of
girl
that
i
could
die
for
if
all
irish
girls
are
like
her
ireland
must
be
a
wonderful
country
to
live
in
but
they
are
not
said
ruth
half
of
them
are
quite
commonplace
she
happens
to
be
rich
and
beautiful
and
to
have
a
taking
way
but
all
the
others
are
not
like
her
i
am
certain
of
it
anyhow
whether
they
are
or
not
i
am
glad
to
belong
to
the
society
said
susy
it
will
give
us
great
fun
and
we
need
not
mind
now
whether
the
paying
girls
are
disagreeable
to
us
or
not
then
too
think
of
the
blouses
we
have
got
oh
dear
oh
dear
when
i
put
mine
on
on
sunday
mother
will
gape
i
shall
feel
proud
of
myself
in
it
it
was
just
sweet
of
her
to
get
things
like
this
to
give
us
and
she
knew
we
were
well
off
oh
i
do
think
she
one
in
a
thousand
she
must
have
thought
of
you
ruth
when
she
ordered
these
sweet
colors
for
that
color
is
yours
is
it
i
suppose
so
said
ruth
well
all
the
same
i
feel
rather
anxious
i
like
her
of
course
but
i
think
she
is
mistaken
i
must
go
on
now
but
i
feel
somehow
what
said
susy
with
some
impatience
as
though
i
had
not
done
right
as
though
i
had
something
to
conceal
well
i
ca
help
myself
only
i
wo
hate
the
girls
who
are
good
to
me
susy
we
wo
be
in
time
for
school
in
the
morning
if
we
stay
talking
any
longer
chapter
xi
the
blouse
and
the
robbery
susy
hopkins
shared
none
of
ruth
craven
scruples
to
her
the
wild
irish
girls
society
was
all
that
was
lovely
she
trod
on
air
as
she
went
down
the
street
and
when
she
finally
let
herself
into
her
mother
little
shop
locked
the
door
after
her
and
went
softly
upstairs
her
heart
was
beating
so
loud
that
she
hardly
knew
herself
she
slept
in
a
tiny
room
just
at
the
back
of
her
mother
it
was
sparsely
furnished
and
had
a
sloping
roof
at
one
side
the
chest
of
drawers
also
did
duty
as
a
and
there
was
a
small
square
of
placed
on
the
top
susy
had
secured
a
candle
in
a
tin
candlestick
with
which
she
had
lighted
herself
to
her
bedroom
but
when
she
got
there
she
had
no
intention
of
putting
up
with
such
feeble
illumination
she
first
of
all
drew
the
bolt
to
secure
herself
against
intrusion
and
then
stepping
on
tiptoe
she
unlocked
a
drawer
and
took
from
it
several
ends
of
candle
which
she
had
collected
from
time
to
time
these
she
stuck
on
the
and
when
she
had
made
her
little
garret
almost
as
bright
as
day
she
unfolded
her
blouse
she
bent
low
over
her
treasure
examining
the
blue
embroidery
which
was
rendered
still
more
fascinating
with
small
stitches
of
pink
silk
looking
with
ecstacy
at
the
real
lace
round
the
neck
and
cuffs
and
finally
pressing
the
delicate
color
against
her
blooming
cheek
susy
hopkins
was
quite
an
little
girl
her
nose
was
decidedly
snub
her
mouth
wide
but
her
eyes
were
dark
and
bright
and
she
had
fairly
good
eyebrows
she
had
a
low
forehead
rather
nice
curly
hair
and
a
high
color
in
her
cheeks
in
this
blouse
i
shall
look
a
positive
beauty
she
thought
wo
tom
respect
me
when
he
sees
me
in
it
on
sunday
i
must
try
it
on
now
i
really
must
accordingly
she
slipped
off
her
bodice
and
substituted
the
cashmere
blouse
for
the
ugly
and
threadbare
garment
she
had
removed
whether
the
blouse
was
becoming
to
susy
hopkins
or
not
remains
to
be
proved
but
it
certainly
delighted
its
wearer
causing
her
eyes
to
sparkle
and
the
color
in
her
cheeks
to
grow
brighter
it
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
she
thought
why
kathleen
is
like
a
fairy
godmother
and
how
well
it
fits
and
what
a
perfect
cut
about
the
neck
and
oh
these
darling
little
cuffs
at
the
end
of
the
sleeves
and
this
sweet
pink
embroidery
and
this
little
ruffle
of
lace
round
the
neck
oh
there
never
never
was
anything
made
so
beautifully
before
i
am
in
luck
i
am
i
am
her
mother
hand
knocking
on
the
wall
brought
her
down
from
the
clouds
go
to
bed
dear
called
out
her
parent
it
is
very
late
and
you
are
disturbing
me
yes
mother
called
back
susy
she
removed
the
blouse
folded
it
in
put
it
into
her
drawer
blew
out
the
candles
and
got
into
bed
but
all
through
the
remainder
of
the
night
susy
dreamt
of
her
blouse
the
blouse
filled
her
thoughts
otherwise
she
might
have
been
in
raptures
over
her
pretty
silver
locket
and
its
green
ribbon
but
as
this
was
for
private
wear
and
must
on
no
account
be
shown
to
any
one
who
was
not
a
member
of
the
society
it
did
not
give
her
the
amount
of
rapture
it
would
otherwise
have
done
it
is
lovely
too
it
is
a
badge
and
means
a
great
deal
she
said
to
herself
and
she
closed
her
hand
over
it
as
she
lay
in
bed
it
is
tiresome
that
i
can
not
show
it
it
is
a
sweet
little
locket
and
i
might
save
up
money
enough
to
have
it
gilded
over
people
would
think
i
had
a
gold
locket
i
have
always
nearly
died
to
have
one
but
of
course
i
could
do
that
for
it
would
displease
our
queen
the
darling
and
i
would
for
all
i
am
worth
do
anything
to
annoy
her
oh
dear
things
are
turning
out
lovely
i
am
twice
as
happy
a
girl
as
i
was
before
kathleen
came
to
the
school
at
school
next
day
the
members
of
the
new
society
looked
a
little
conscious
their
eyes
often
met
and
those
eyes
spoke
volumes
sometimes
a
girl
would
put
her
hand
up
to
her
neck
in
a
somewhat
significant
way
and
another
girl
would
respond
with
a
similar
signal
there
was
a
sort
of
suppressed
excitement
in
the
school
but
the
teachers
remarked
nothing
on
the
contrary
they
were
pleased
with
the
way
lessons
were
done
exercises
gone
through
and
work
accomplished
the
girls
were
so
completely
in
league
with
each
other
so
full
of
delight
over
the
new
amusement
which
kathleen
had
started
in
their
midst
that
they
had
no
time
to
be
supercilious
or
disagreeable
to
the
paying
girls
who
were
left
in
peace
they
were
usually
a
good
deal
tormented
by
the
foundationers
who
took
their
revenge
by
small
spiteful
ways
by
taking
the
ink
when
they
did
not
want
it
by
removing
good
pens
and
putting
bad
ones
in
their
places
by
spilling
ink
on
the
blotting
paper
in
short
they
had
many
ways
of
rendering
the
life
of
a
paying
girl
anything
but
happy
however
all
was
peace
and
quiet
kathleen
walked
in
her
radiant
fashion
through
her
lessons
her
beautiful
face
could
not
but
be
an
attraction
she
was
very
bright
and
very
smart
and
even
alice
gave
her
an
approving
glance
mother
is
right
she
thought
she
is
a
little
better
than
she
was
if
only
she
would
take
a
real
interest
in
her
work
i
should
have
hopes
of
her
now
cassandra
weldon
had
come
to
the
school
that
day
with
the
intention
of
asking
ruth
craven
to
come
home
with
her
she
had
a
suggestion
to
make
to
ruth
she
knew
that
the
little
girl
was
very
poor
and
very
clever
cassandra
was
working
very
hard
for
one
of
the
big
scholarships
and
her
mother
had
gone
to
the
expense
of
getting
a
special
coach
to
help
her
at
home
cassandra
had
spoken
to
her
mother
and
her
mother
had
agreed
that
ruth
might
come
back
with
her
each
evening
and
also
take
advantage
of
the
services
of
miss
renshaw
if
ruth
got
a
scholarship
she
would
indeed
be
a
happy
girl
and
it
was
cassandra
opinion
that
although
she
had
been
such
a
short
time
in
the
school
she
would
have
a
very
good
chance
if
she
got
a
little
outside
help
accordingly
cassandra
waited
for
ruth
outside
the
school
when
lessons
were
over
during
the
morning
her
eyes
had
travelled
in
ruth
direction
pretty
often
and
her
eyes
had
conveyed
to
the
little
girl
all
sorts
of
kind
and
friendly
messages
but
ruth
had
avoided
cassandra
eyes
she
had
made
up
her
mind
i
ca
be
two
things
she
said
to
herself
i
have
elected
to
go
with
the
foundationers
and
with
kathleen
although
i
do
care
for
the
society
and
i
do
want
to
belong
to
the
girls
who
band
themselves
together
against
the
paying
girls
but
if
i
do
this
i
certainly
take
advantage
of
cassandra
kindness
i
do
love
her
i
am
sure
i
should
love
her
dearly
but
i
ca
have
much
to
say
to
her
now
accordingly
while
cassandra
waited
for
ruth
hoping
that
she
would
appear
at
any
moment
and
that
she
could
tell
her
what
a
good
thing
she
had
arranged
on
her
behalf
ruth
avoided
cassandra
presently
kathleen
dressed
somewhat
extravagantly
and
with
her
blue
velvet
cap
perched
upon
the
back
of
her
golden
hair
strolled
out
of
school
she
had
a
crimson
sash
round
her
black
velvet
dress
and
a
wide
lace
collar
encircled
her
neck
she
was
fastening
a
heavily
embroidered
coat
of
blue
cashmere
when
cassandra
accosted
her
how
do
you
do
miss
she
said
how
are
you
replied
kathleen
just
raising
her
brows
and
then
turning
to
say
something
to
susy
hopkins
cassandra
frowned
how
can
kathleen
who
with
all
her
eccentricities
is
a
lady
waste
her
time
talking
to
an
insignificant
little
girl
like
susy
thought
cassandra
kathleen
seemed
to
read
her
neighbor
thoughts
for
she
slipped
her
hand
inside
susy
arm
i
will
walk
with
you
a
little
way
she
said
i
have
something
i
want
to
say
one
moment
first
said
cassandra
have
you
seen
ruth
craven
anywhere
oh
yes
ruth
has
left
the
school
did
you
see
her
go
there
she
is
crossing
the
field
i
suppose
she
is
in
a
hurry
to
get
home
thank
you
said
cassandra
she
caught
up
her
books
and
started
running
in
the
direction
of
ruth
craven
how
tiresome
of
her
to
have
gone
so
fast
she
said
to
herself
presently
she
shouted
ruth
name
and
ruth
was
obliged
to
stop
why
ruth
said
cassandra
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
generally
wait
to
talk
to
me
after
school
is
over
why
are
you
in
such
a
hurry
i
am
not
said
ruth
who
was
not
going
to
get
out
of
her
difficulty
by
telling
an
untruth
well
if
you
are
not
in
a
hurry
why
are
you
running
across
this
field
at
the
rate
of
a
hunt
it
looks
as
if
you
were
cassandra
paused
and
the
color
came
into
her
cheeks
as
if
you
were
running
away
from
me
ruth
was
silent
cassandra
came
close
to
her
and
looked
into
her
face
what
is
the
matter
ruth
she
repeated
i
have
promised
granny
that
i
would
help
her
with
some
darning
this
afternoon
your
granny
must
do
without
you
for
you
have
got
to
come
back
with
me
oh
indeed
i
ca
but
you
must
my
little
girl
i
have
got
the
most
heavenly
plan
to
suggest
to
you
cassandra
laid
her
hand
on
ruth
shoulder
ruth
started
away
what
is
it
ruth
how
queer
you
look
what
is
the
matter
i
must
get
home
i
promised
granny
but
listen
before
you
decide
you
know
miss
renshaw
do
you
miss
maria
renshaw
the
coach
yes
i
do
do
you
remember
my
pointing
her
out
to
you
of
course
i
remember
it
cassandra
and
she
looked
oh
lovely
she
is
far
more
lovely
than
she
looks
that
is
if
you
mean
she
is
clever
and
taking
and
all
the
rest
she
is
just
perfectly
splendid
she
makes
you
see
a
thing
at
the
first
glance
she
has
a
way
of
putting
information
into
you
so
that
you
can
not
help
knowing
oh
she
is
delightful
and
mother
says
that
i
may
have
her
to
coach
me
for
the
big
scholarship
the
scholarship
you
know
there
are
two
of
them
there
is
one
quite
in
your
line
and
there
is
one
in
mine
and
there
is
no
earthly
reason
why
you
should
not
get
one
and
i
the
other
well
said
ruth
her
beautiful
fair
delicately
chiselled
face
had
turned
pale
she
stood
very
upright
and
looked
full
at
cassandra
it
could
be
easily
done
dear
little
ruth
miss
renshaw
would
just
as
soon
coach
two
girls
as
one
and
mother
has
arranged
it
yes
she
has
arranged
it
absolutely
miss
renshaw
will
coach
you
and
me
together
you
are
to
come
home
with
me
every
evening
she
will
give
us
both
an
hour
is
it
too
splendid
ruth
did
not
speak
are
you
pleased
ruth
do
you
think
it
is
very
nice
of
me
to
think
of
my
friends
you
are
my
friend
you
know
oh
no
said
ruth
but
what
is
it
what
is
the
matter
i
i
ca
you
can
it
will
be
madness
to
refuse
think
what
a
chance
is
offered
you
if
you
get
miss
renshaw
instruction
you
are
safe
to
get
that
scholarship
and
it
is
for
three
years
ruth
it
would
send
you
with
a
little
help
from
your
grandfather
perhaps
to
holloway
college
perhaps
to
somerville
or
newnham
or
even
girton
perhaps
you
could
try
for
a
scholarship
in
one
of
these
great
colleges
afterwards
you
refuse
it
it
means
oh
it
means
all
the
difference
in
your
whole
life
i
know
said
ruth
cassandra
i
will
write
to
you
i
ca
decide
just
now
i
am
awfully
obliged
to
you
i
ca
express
what
i
feel
you
are
good
you
are
very
very
good
ruth
caught
one
of
cassandra
hands
and
raised
it
to
her
lips
you
are
very
good
she
said
again
meanwhile
kathleen
after
walking
a
very
short
way
with
susy
hopkins
gave
her
an
abrupt
and
started
running
in
the
direction
of
the
tennants
house
she
did
not
care
a
bit
for
susy
but
being
a
member
of
the
wild
irish
girls
and
not
only
a
member
but
one
of
the
cabinet
she
must
on
all
occasions
be
kind
to
her
nevertheless
a
commonplace
little
girl
like
susy
hopkins
had
not
one
thing
in
common
with
kathleen
everything
is
going
splendidly
she
said
to
herself
no
fear
now
that
i
shall
not
have
plenty
of
excitement
in
the
coming
i
mean
to
write
to
father
and
ask
him
whether
i
may
not
invite
some
of
the
members
of
the
cabinet
to
carrigrohane
would
they
enjoy
it
kate
rourke
of
course
must
come
and
dear
little
ruth
craven
how
pale
and
sweet
ruth
looked
she
is
far
and
away
the
nicest
girl
in
the
school
i
am
so
glad
i
have
taken
steps
to
prevent
that
horrid
friendship
with
cassandra
coming
to
anything
ruth
must
love
anybody
in
the
school
very
much
except
me
oh
things
are
going
well
and
alice
little
guesses
what
she
is
driving
me
to
by
her
extraordinary
behavior
kathleen
entered
the
house
banging
the
door
loudly
after
her
as
was
her
fashion
another
little
girl
had
also
reached
home
but
she
did
not
bang
the
door
she
entered
her
mother
shop
to
encounter
the
flushed
and
face
of
her
parent
well
susy
said
hopkins
i
would
have
thought
it
of
you
why
what
is
it
mother
there
taken
out
of
the
till
said
hopkins
some
one
must
have
come
into
the
shop
for
the
accounts
are
short
when
i
left
the
house
yesterday
there
were
three
pounds
in
the
till
three
pounds
and
you
sold
according
to
your
own
showing
a
of
paper
which
makes
an
extra
penny
but
when
i
went
into
the
accounts
this
morning
i
found
that
the
whole
amount
was
only
two
pounds
one
shilling
and
a
halfpenny
is
missing
susy
what
does
this
mean
i
am
sure
mother
i
ca
tell
you
no
one
came
into
the
shop
certainly
no
one
stole
the
money
my
dear
child
seeing
is
believing
i
assure
you
there
are
only
two
pounds
one
shilling
and
a
halfpenny
in
the
till
i
scarcely
took
a
penny
this
morning
and
that
makes
it
impossible
for
me
to
pay
my
rent
as
i
meant
to
do
who
can
have
come
in
and
stolen
very
nearly
a
pound
worth
of
my
money
nobody
mother
dear
do
let
me
examine
the
till
are
you
quite
positive
that
no
one
came
into
the
shop
nobody
mother
you
did
not
leave
the
shop
even
for
a
moment
yes
i
went
to
sit
in
the
parlor
oh
susy
there
you
are
i
trust
you
with
my
house
and
property
and
you
leave
the
shop
without
any
one
in
it
did
you
lock
the
till
susy
had
an
unpleasant
memory
of
having
found
the
till
open
when
she
returned
to
attend
to
a
customer
no
she
said
hanging
her
head
hopkins
uttered
a
heavy
sigh
oh
dear
she
said
and
as
you
sat
in
the
parlor
you
could
see
the
shop
you
did
not
leave
the
parlor
did
you
for
one
minute
susy
remembered
that
she
had
gone
upstairs
for
an
but
she
determined
not
to
tell
her
mother
of
this
further
enormity
i
was
either
in
the
shop
or
in
the
parlor
all
the
time
i
only
went
into
the
parlor
because
i
could
not
do
my
exercises
in
the
shop
but
i
sat
where
i
could
see
everything
you
could
have
done
so
this
money
would
not
have
gone
without
hands
how
am
i
to
manage
i
do
know
i
have
lost
a
large
sum
for
such
a
poor
woman
susy
pitied
her
mother
tried
to
assure
her
that
the
fault
was
not
hers
was
convinced
that
the
money
would
be
found
and
went
on
talking
a
lot
of
nonsense
until
hopkins
fairly
lost
her
temper
examine
the
drawer
for
yourself
she
said
i
tell
you
what
it
is
susy
i
wo
be
able
to
buy
you
a
new
winter
frock
at
all
this
year
and
you
will
have
to
have
your
boots
patched
for
i
ca
afford
a
new
pair
i
was
trying
to
collect
a
pound
towards
your
winter
things
but
this
puts
a
stop
to
everything
mother
does
know
what
a
lovely
blouse
i
got
thought
susy
when
she
sees
me
in
that
she
be
quite
cheered
up
the
moment
she
thought
of
the
blouse
the
little
girl
felt
a
frantic
desire
to
run
upstairs
to
look
at
it
mother
she
said
i
do
mind
a
bit
about
the
winter
dress
and
if
my
boots
are
neatly
patched
and
well
blacked
every
day
i
dare
say
i
can
do
with
them
a
little
longer
and
i
will
sit
with
you
this
afternoon
mother
and
help
you
to
sew
i
ca
understand
who
could
have
stolen
the
money
perhaps
it
is
a
practical
joke
of
tom
you
know
he
is
fond
of
doing
things
of
that
sort
now
and
then
no
it
is
for
i
asked
him
who
can
have
come
into
the
shop
do
you
think
you
fell
asleep
over
your
work
oh
no
then
it
is
a
mystery
past
bearing
if
nobody
came
in
and
you
never
left
either
the
shop
or
the
parlor
that
money
was
taken
out
of
the
till
as
though
by
magic
we
will
find
it
mother
we
are
sure
to
find
it
said
susy
and
the
way
she
said
these
words
aggravated
poor
hopkins
as
she
said
afterwards
more
than
a
little
chapter
xii
tom
hopkins
and
his
way
with
aunt
church
it
was
quite
true
that
hopkins
could
ill
afford
to
lose
so
large
a
sum
as
out
of
her
small
earnings
during
her
husband
lifetime
the
stationer
shop
had
gone
well
and
provided
a
comfortable
living
for
his
wife
son
and
daughter
but
unfortunately
in
an
evil
moment
he
had
been
induced
to
put
his
hand
to
a
bill
for
a
friend
the
friend
had
as
usually
is
the
case
become
bankrupt
poor
hopkins
had
to
pay
the
money
and
from
that
moment
the
affairs
in
the
stationer
shop
were
the
reverse
of
flourishing
in
fact
the
blow
killed
the
poor
man
he
lingered
for
a
time
and
unable
to
rouse
himself
and
finally
died
about
three
years
before
the
date
of
this
story
for
a
time
hopkins
was
quite
prostrate
but
being
a
woman
with
a
good
deal
of
vigor
and
determination
she
induced
one
of
her
relatives
to
lend
her
one
hundred
pounds
and
determined
to
keep
on
with
the
shop
she
could
not
of
course
stock
it
as
fully
as
she
would
have
liked
she
could
never
extend
her
connection
beyond
mere
stationery
pens
and
a
very
few
books
and
christmas
cards
in
the
winter
still
she
managed
to
support
herself
and
tom
and
susy
but
it
was
a
scraping
along
all
the
time
she
had
to
count
every
penny
and
above
all
things
to
avoid
going
in
debt
she
was
only
in
debt
for
the
one
hundred
pounds
which
had
been
lent
to
her
by
an
aunt
of
her
husband
an
old
woman
of
the
name
of
church
who
lived
in
a
neighboring
village
about
four
miles
away
church
was
quite
rich
according
to
the
hopkinses
ideas
of
wealth
she
lived
alone
and
hoarded
her
money
she
had
not
been
at
all
willing
to
lend
hopkins
the
hundred
pounds
but
as
she
had
really
been
fond
of
hopkins
and
had
at
one
time
meant
to
make
him
her
heir
she
had
listened
to
hopkins
lamentations
and
desired
her
to
send
tom
to
her
to
inspect
him
and
had
finally
handed
over
the
money
which
was
to
be
paid
back
by
monthly
installments
within
the
space
of
three
years
hopkins
was
so
relieved
to
get
the
money
that
she
never
thought
at
all
of
the
terrible
tax
it
would
be
to
return
it
still
by
working
hard
morning
noon
and
night
she
added
to
her
gains
by
doing
fine
needlework
for
several
ladies
who
said
that
no
one
could
embroider
like
hopkins
she
managed
to
make
two
ends
just
meet
together
and
she
always
continued
to
send
church
her
two
pounds
fifteen
shillings
and
sevenpence
on
the
first
of
every
month
tom
was
the
one
who
generally
ran
across
to
the
old
lady
with
the
money
and
so
fond
was
she
of
him
that
she
often
gave
him
a
piece
of
cake
and
even
on
one
or
two
rare
occasions
kept
him
to
dinner
tom
enjoyed
his
visits
to
church
and
hopkins
was
sure
to
encourage
him
to
go
to
her
as
she
hoped
against
hope
that
when
the
old
lady
died
tom
would
be
left
some
of
her
money
it
was
on
a
wednesday
that
susy
sat
in
the
parlor
and
forgot
all
about
the
interests
of
the
shop
it
was
on
that
very
night
that
the
tramp
had
come
in
and
helped
himself
to
a
and
some
silver
out
of
the
till
and
it
was
on
the
following
saturday
that
hopkins
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
borrowed
the
hundred
pounds
from
aunt
church
as
she
called
the
old
lady
found
that
she
could
not
return
even
a
portion
of
what
had
just
fallen
due
she
called
tom
to
her
side
tom
she
said
you
must
go
and
see
aunt
church
this
afternoon
as
soon
as
ever
you
come
in
you
must
go
and
you
must
tell
her
of
course
i
go
mother
answered
the
boy
i
always
like
going
to
aunt
church
she
is
very
kind
to
me
she
said
next
time
i
came
along
she
show
me
things
in
her
microscope
she
has
got
a
beetle
wing
mother
mounted
on
glass
and
when
you
gaze
down
at
it
it
seems
to
be
covered
with
beautiful
feathers
as
long
as
though
they
were
on
a
big
bird
and
she
has
got
a
drop
of
water
full
of
wriggly
things
all
alive
and
she
says
we
drink
it
by
the
gallon
and
it
is
no
wonder
we
feel
bad
in
our
insides
i
go
right
enough
i
suppose
you
have
the
money
ready
no
tom
that
just
what
i
have
not
got
i
told
you
how
that
night
when
i
had
the
misfortune
to
go
and
see
your
aunt
and
look
after
her
sick
child
some
one
came
into
the
shop
and
stole
out
of
the
till
i
am
so
short
from
the
loss
of
that
money
that
i
pay
aunt
church
for
at
least
another
week
ask
her
if
she
be
kind
enough
to
give
me
a
week
grace
tom
that
a
good
boy
i
ca
think
how
the
money
was
stolen
why
do
you
put
it
into
the
hands
of
the
police
said
tom
why
tom
said
his
mother
looking
at
him
with
admiration
you
are
a
smart
boy
do
you
know
i
never
thought
of
that
i
will
go
round
to
the
this
very
afternoon
and
get
macartney
to
take
it
up
but
mother
the
thief
whoever
he
is
has
left
the
place
long
before
now
the
money
was
stolen
on
wednesday
and
this
is
saturday
morning
well
tom
there
no
saying
anyhow
i
will
go
round
to
the
and
lodge
the
information
accordingly
while
susy
was
again
trying
on
her
lovely
cashmere
blouse
behind
locked
doors
upstairs
tom
and
his
mother
were
plotting
how
best
to
cover
the
loss
of
the
naughty
susy
having
made
up
her
mind
to
deny
herself
a
new
frock
and
new
boots
had
given
the
matter
no
further
consideration
she
was
accustomed
to
the
fact
that
her
mother
was
always
in
money
difficulties
as
long
as
she
could
remember
this
was
the
state
of
things
at
home
she
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
persons
were
always
in
a
frantic
state
about
money
and
she
had
no
desire
to
join
these
anxious
ones
herself
as
she
could
not
mend
matters
she
did
not
see
why
she
should
worry
about
them
tom
had
a
scrap
of
dinner
and
then
ran
off
to
see
aunt
church
he
found
the
old
lady
sitting
at
her
parlor
window
looking
out
as
usual
for
him
she
was
dressed
in
rusty
black
she
had
a
front
of
stiff
curls
on
her
forehead
a
white
over
it
and
a
small
black
crape
handkerchief
crossed
on
her
breast
church
was
a
little
woman
she
had
very
tiny
feet
and
hands
and
was
very
proud
of
them
she
never
thought
of
buying
any
new
clothes
and
her
black
bombazine
dress
was
more
brown
than
black
now
so
was
her
shawl
and
so
was
the
handkerchief
which
she
wore
round
her
neck
her
cap
was
tied
with
ribbons
which
had
been
washed
so
often
that
they
were
no
longer
white
but
yellow
she
came
to
the
door
to
greet
tom
when
he
arrived
and
called
him
in
ah
tom
she
said
i
have
got
a
piece
of
plumcake
waiting
for
you
and
if
you
are
a
really
good
boy
and
will
shoo
the
fowls
into
my
backyard
and
shut
the
gate
on
them
you
may
look
into
my
microscope
thank
you
aunt
church
said
tom
shall
i
go
at
once
and
shoo
the
fowls
you
had
best
give
me
my
money
first
here
is
the
box
you
drop
it
in
two
pounds
in
gold
i
hope
to
goodness
your
mother
has
sent
the
money
in
gold
two
pounds
in
gold
and
the
rest
in
silver
now
then
here
is
the
box
drop
it
in
like
a
good
child
and
then
you
shall
shoo
the
fowls
and
have
your
plumcake
and
look
in
the
microscope
but
aunt
church
said
tom
he
planted
himself
right
in
front
of
the
old
lady
he
was
a
tall
boy
well
set
up
with
a
sandy
head
and
a
face
covered
with
freckles
he
had
rather
shallow
blue
eyes
and
a
wide
mouth
but
his
whole
expression
was
honest
and
full
of
fun
i
am
desperately
sorry
and
so
is
mother
eh
what
said
the
old
lady
she
put
her
hand
to
her
ear
i
am
a
bit
hard
of
hearing
my
dear
come
close
to
me
mother
awfully
sorry
but
she
ca
pay
you
oh
said
church
ca
pay
me
but
it
the
first
of
the
month
and
she
was
never
behindhand
i
will
say
that
in
her
payments
before
she
fretting
past
bearing
said
tom
she
give
all
the
world
to
be
able
to
pay
you
up
but
she
ai
got
the
money
and
that
a
fact
we
have
had
a
robbery
in
the
shop
aunt
church
and
mother
has
took
on
dreadful
a
burglary
said
church
now
tell
me
all
about
it
stand
here
and
pour
your
words
into
my
ear
i
am
very
much
interested
about
burglaries
was
there
attempted
murder
speak
up
boy
speak
up
tom
quite
longed
to
say
that
there
was
had
he
been
able
to
assure
church
that
burglars
with
masks
on
their
faces
had
burst
into
the
shop
at
dead
of
night
and
penetrated
to
his
mother
bedroom
and
had
held
pistols
to
her
throat
and
susy
throat
and
a
great
bare
glittering
knife
to
his
and
had
he
been
further
able
to
tell
her
that
he
himself
unaided
had
grappled
with
the
enemy
had
wrested
the
knife
from
the
hand
of
one
and
knocked
the
loaded
pistols
from
the
hands
of
the
others
then
indeed
he
would
have
felt
himself
a
hero
and
the
mere
fact
of
not
being
able
to
return
the
money
on
the
appointed
day
would
not
have
signified
but
tom
was
truthful
and
he
had
but
a
lame
story
to
tell
had
been
abstracted
from
the
till
nobody
knew
how
it
had
been
done
and
nobody
had
the
least
idea
who
was
the
thief
church
who
would
have
given
her
niece
unlimited
time
to
return
the
money
had
there
been
a
real
proper
bloodthirsty
burglary
was
not
at
all
inclined
to
show
mercy
when
the
affair
dwindled
down
into
an
unknown
thief
taking
a
small
sum
of
money
out
of
the
till
why
did
you
get
it
back
she
said
why
did
you
send
for
the
police
my
word
this
is
a
nice
state
of
things
and
me
to
be
out
of
my
money
that
i
counted
upon
why
tom
boy
i
spend
that
money
on
my
food
rent
and
the
little
expenses
i
have
to
go
to
i
made
up
my
mind
when
i
drew
that
hundred
pounds
from
my
dear
husband
savings
that
whatever
happened
i
make
that
sum
last
me
for
all
expenses
for
three
years
and
i
have
done
it
tom
i
have
done
it
i
am
in
low
water
tom
i
want
the
money
i
want
it
just
as
much
as
your
poor
mother
does
but
you
have
money
in
the
bank
have
you
that
is
no
affair
of
yours
tom
hopkins
do
talk
in
that
silly
way
to
me
no
i
do
want
you
to
shoo
the
fowls
into
the
yard
and
i
mean
to
give
you
any
plumcake
i
shall
have
to
eat
it
myself
for
i
have
no
money
to
buy
anything
else
and
i
wo
show
you
the
beautiful
wings
of
the
beetle
in
the
microscope
you
can
go
home
to
your
mother
and
tell
her
i
am
very
much
annoyed
indeed
but
aunt
church
said
tom
if
you
were
to
see
poor
mother
you
would
blame
her
she
looks
oh
so
thin
and
so
tired
she
terribly
unhappy
and
she
will
be
certain
sure
to
pay
you
next
week
it
was
silly
of
her
i
will
own
not
to
think
of
the
police
sooner
but
she
gone
to
them
ordered
by
me
to
do
that
same
that
was
thoughtful
enough
of
you
tom
and
i
do
object
to
giving
you
a
morsel
of
the
stalest
cake
i
always
keep
three
cakes
in
three
tin
boxes
and
you
can
have
a
morsel
of
the
stalest
it
is
more
than
two
months
old
but
you
wo
mind
that
not
me
said
tom
i
like
stale
cakes
best
he
added
determined
to
show
his
aunt
that
he
was
ready
to
be
pleased
with
everything
he
was
a
very
knowing
boy
and
spoke
up
so
well
and
was
so
evidently
sorry
himself
and
so
positive
that
as
soon
as
ever
the
police
were
told
they
would
simply
lay
their
hands
on
the
thief
and
the
thief
would
disgorge
his
spoils
that
aunt
church
was
fain
to
believe
him
in
the
end
she
and
he
made
a
compact
i
tell
you
what
it
is
he
said
you
have
been
to
see
mother
for
a
long
time
and
if
you
ai
got
any
money
to
buy
a
dinner
for
yourself
it
is
but
fair
you
should
have
a
slice
off
our
sunday
joint
sunday
joint
indeed
snapped
church
you
could
expect
us
not
to
have
a
bit
of
meat
on
sunday
said
tom
why
we
get
so
weak
that
mother
could
earn
the
money
she
sends
you
every
month
and
you
could
do
your
lessons
and
be
the
fine
big
boy
that
i
am
proud
of
said
church
now
to
tell
the
truth
i
ca
bear
that
sister
of
yours
susy
you
call
her
but
i
have
a
liking
for
you
tom
hopkins
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
if
you
will
let
me
come
here
i
push
you
all
the
way
to
merrifield
in
time
for
our
dinner
would
you
like
that
and
i
bring
you
back
again
in
the
evening
there
your
own
old
that
uncle
church
used
to
be
moved
about
in
before
he
died
to
be
sure
there
is
said
church
her
eyes
brightening
but
the
lining
has
got
who
minds
that
said
tom
i
go
and
clean
it
after
you
have
given
me
that
bit
of
cake
you
promised
me
everything
ended
quite
satisfactorily
as
far
as
tom
was
concerned
for
church
forgot
her
anger
in
the
interest
that
the
boy
visit
gave
her
she
consulted
him
about
her
fowls
and
gave
him
a
egg
to
slip
into
his
pocket
for
his
own
supper
later
on
she
allowed
him
to
munch
some
very
poor
and
very
stale
plumcake
finally
she
gave
him
his
heart
delight
for
he
was
allowed
to
peer
into
the
old
microscope
and
revel
in
the
sight
of
the
beetle
wings
with
thin
sweeping
plumes
as
he
afterwards
described
them
it
was
rather
late
when
tom
returned
home
he
burst
into
the
parlor
where
his
mother
and
susy
were
sitting
mother
he
said
i
have
done
everything
splendidly
and
she
coming
to
dine
with
us
she
what
said
hopkins
aunt
church
is
coming
to
dine
with
us
she
was
mad
about
the
money
and
nobody
could
have
been
nastier
than
she
might
have
turned
out
but
for
me
but
it
all
right
now
we
must
have
a
nice
dinner
for
her
she
is
very
fond
of
good
things
and
as
she
never
gives
them
to
herself
she
will
enjoy
ours
all
the
more
she
think
that
i
am
rich
when
i
am
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
said
hopkins
but
i
suppose
you
have
done
everything
for
the
best
tom
and
i
must
go
around
to
the
butcher
for
a
little
addition
to
the
dinner
hopkins
left
the
house
and
tom
sank
into
a
chair
by
his
sister
it
golloptious
for
me
he
said
she
taking
no
end
of
a
fancy
to
me
see
this
egg
she
gave
it
to
me
for
my
supper
mother
shall
have
it
mother
is
looking
very
white
about
the
gills
a
egg
that
she
has
to
pay
for
will
nourish
her
up
like
anything
so
it
will
said
susy
we
boil
it
and
say
nothing
about
it
and
just
pop
it
on
her
plate
when
she
having
her
supper
all
the
same
tom
i
wish
you
had
asked
old
aunt
church
here
she
is
such
a
queer
old
body
and
the
neighbors
sometimes
drop
in
on
sundays
and
i
have
asked
miss
kathleen
to
come
in
and
she
has
promised
to
what
said
tom
that
grand
beauty
of
a
young
lady
the
pride
of
the
school
why
everybody
is
talking
about
her
at
the
boys
school
caught
sight
of
her
and
there
is
a
boy
that
has
fallen
in
love
with
her
they
all
slink
behind
the
wall
and
bob
up
as
she
comes
by
you
do
mean
that
coming
here
yes
why
not
she
very
fond
of
me
but
she
no
end
of
a
howler
they
say
she
worth
her
weight
in
gold
and
that
her
father
is
a
sort
of
king
in
ireland
why
should
she
take
up
with
a
little
girl
like
you
well
tom
some
people
like
me
although
you
think
but
little
of
your
sister
kathleen
is
very
fond
of
me
i
invited
her
to
have
tea
with
us
and
she
is
coming
my
word
said
tom
to
think
that
i
shall
be
sitting
at
the
same
table
with
her
i
be
able
to
make
my
own
terms
now
with
john
short
and
harry
reid
and
the
rest
of
the
chaps
why
susy
you
must
be
a
genius
and
i
thought
you
were
much
of
a
sort
i
am
better
than
you
think
and
she
is
fond
of
me
and
you
really
and
truly
call
her
by
her
christian
name
of
course
i
do
susy
longed
to
tell
tom
about
the
wonderful
society
but
its
strictest
rule
was
that
it
was
never
to
be
spoken
about
to
outsiders
susy
as
a
member
of
the
cabinet
must
certainly
be
one
of
the
last
to
break
the
rules
hopkins
came
back
at
that
moment
she
had
added
a
pound
of
sausage
and
a
little
piece
of
pork
to
their
usual
sunday
fare
she
had
also
brought
sixpennyworth
of
apples
with
her
these
are
to
make
a
pudding
she
said
i
think
we
shall
do
now
very
well
susy
and
tom
quite
agreed
with
their
mother
susy
rose
and
prepared
supper
and
at
the
crucial
moment
the
egg
was
laid
on
hopkins
plate
it
takes
perhaps
a
great
deal
of
poverty
to
truly
appreciate
a
egg
hopkins
was
delighted
with
hers
she
thought
tom
the
noblest
boy
in
the
world
for
having
denied
himself
in
order
to
give
it
to
her
tears
filled
her
tired
eyes
as
she
thanked
god
for
her
good
children
susy
and
tom
watched
her
as
she
ate
the
egg
and
thought
how
delicious
it
must
taste
but
were
glad
she
had
it
the
following
day
dawned
bright
and
clear
with
a
suspicion
of
frost
in
the
air
it
was
as
tom
expressed
it
a
perfect
day
susy
went
to
church
with
her
mother
in
the
morning
the
dinner
being
all
prepared
and
left
to
cook
itself
in
the
oven
tom
started
at
about
eleven
on
his
walk
to
the
tiny
village
where
church
lived
as
soon
as
susy
returned
from
her
place
of
worship
she
helped
her
mother
to
get
the
little
parlor
ready
she
put
some
autumn
leaves
in
a
jug
on
the
center
of
the
table
her
mother
brought
out
the
best
china
which
had
not
been
used
since
her
husband
death
the
best
china
was
very
pretty
and
susy
thought
that
no
table
could
look
more
elegant
than
theirs
the
best
china
was
accompanied
by
some
quite
good
knives
and
forks
the
forks
were
real
silver
hopkins
regarded
them
with
pride
if
the
worst
the
very
worst
comes
she
said
to
susy
we
can
sell
them
but
i
cling
to
them
as
a
piece
of
respectability
that
i
never
want
to
part
from
your
dear
father
gave
them
to
me
on
our
a
whole
dozen
of
beautiful
silver
forks
with
the
on
them
and
his
initials
on
the
handle
of
each
i
want
them
to
be
tom
some
day
silver
should
always
be
handed
on
to
the
eldest
son
susy
felt
that
she
was
almost
worthy
of
kathleen
friendship
as
she
regarded
the
silver
forks
you
must
never
part
with
them
mother
she
said
until
tom
is
married
then
of
course
they
will
belong
to
him
you
are
a
good
little
girl
susy
said
her
mother
of
course
there
never
was
a
boy
like
tom
it
was
sweet
of
him
to
give
up
his
egg
to
me
last
night
having
seen
that
the
table
was
in
perfect
order
and
that
the
dinner
was
cooking
as
well
as
dinner
could
in
the
oven
hopkins
went
upstairs
to
put
on
a
lace
collar
and
a
neat
black
silk
apron
meanwhile
susy
had
locked
herself
into
her
own
room
the
crowning
moment
of
her
life
had
arrived
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
wear
her
new
blouse
at
dinner
that
day
susy
stockings
were
coarse
and
showed
darns
here
and
there
susy
shoes
were
rough
and
could
not
altogether
hide
the
disfiguring
patches
on
the
toes
of
each
skirt
was
serge
fairly
neat
in
its
way
altogether
susy
from
her
waist
down
was
a
very
ordinary
little
girl
the
little
daughter
of
poor
people
but
from
her
waist
up
she
was
resplendent
oh
if
i
could
only
show
my
sweet
sweet
little
badge
she
thought
it
would
make
me
perfect
but
i
dare
the
queen
commands
that
it
should
be
hidden
and
the
queen
commands
must
be
obeyed
susy
slipped
into
her
blouse
she
fastened
it
she
put
a
belt
round
her
waist
she
curtsied
before
her
little
glass
she
bobbed
here
she
bobbed
there
she
looked
at
herself
front
view
then
over
her
shoulder
then
with
a
morsel
of
glass
at
her
back
she
surveyed
herself
as
far
as
the
limited
accommodation
of
her
room
afforded
from
every
point
of
view
finally
with
flushed
cheeks
and
a
very
proud
expression
on
her
face
she
tripped
downstairs
the
cashmere
blouse
with
its
real
lace
and
embroidered
trimmings
might
have
been
worn
by
any
girl
even
in
the
highest
station
of
life
hopkins
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
she
called
to
susy
come
and
hold
the
vegetable
dish
child
i
hear
tom
pushing
aunt
church
in
at
the
gate
i
know
he
is
doing
it
by
the
creak
of
the
there
never
was
a
that
creaked
like
that
hold
this
while
i
why
sakes
alive
susy
wherever
did
you
get
oh
it
my
new
blouse
mother
your
new
what
what
you
see
mother
my
new
blouse
do
you
admire
it
hopkins
was
so
stunned
that
she
could
not
speak
for
a
moment
her
face
which
had
been
quite
florid
turned
pale
she
suddenly
put
up
her
hand
and
caught
susy
by
the
arm
oh
mother
do
said
the
little
girl
your
hand
is
clean
oh
you
have
made
a
stain
oh
mother
how
could
you
run
upstairs
at
once
child
and
take
it
off
for
the
life
of
you
let
see
it
she
never
forgive
me
it
is
fit
for
you
susy
it
really
is
wherever
did
you
get
it
from
where
did
you
buy
it
now
susy
had
really
no
intention
of
making
a
secret
with
regard
to
the
blouse
she
meant
to
tell
her
mother
frankly
that
it
was
a
present
from
miss
kathleen
but
hopkins
manner
and
words
put
the
little
girl
into
a
passion
and
she
was
determined
now
not
to
say
a
word
it
is
my
secret
she
said
i
wo
tell
you
how
i
got
it
nor
who
gave
it
to
me
and
i
wo
take
it
off
just
then
there
were
voices
and
aunt
church
called
out
where
are
you
mary
hopkins
why
do
you
show
yourself
fussing
over
fine
living
i
suppose
oh
there
is
your
daughter
my
word
fine
feathers
make

well
as
she
could

of
the
tom
winked
when
he
saw
the
splendid
apparition
then
he
stuck
his
tongue
into
his
cheek
and
coming
close
to
his
sister
he
whispered
wherever
did
you
get
that
toggery
that
nothing

you
said
susy
church
glanced
over
her
shoulder
and
looked
solemnly
at
susy
it
my
opinion
she
said
speaking
in
a
slow
emphatic
rather
awful
voice
that
you
are
a
very
very
bad
little
girl

no
good
mark

words
i
prophesy

prophecy

a
morsel
of
your
grand
dinner
before
i
leave
chapter
xiii
aunt
church
at
dinner
and
the
consequences
thereof
when
church
was
comfortably
established
in
the
in
the
little
parlor
with
her
feet
on
the
fender
and
a
nice
view
of
the
street
from
the
window
near
by
when
her
best
was
perched
upon
her
head
and
her
little
black
mitts
were
drawn
over
her
delicate
small
hands
she
looked
around
her
and
gave
a
brief
sigh
of
satisfaction
upon
my
word
she
said
i
not
at
all
sorry
i
came
there
nothing
like
seeing
things
for
yourself
most
elegant
damask
on
the
table
mary
hopkins
where
did
you
get
that
damask
hopkins
whose
cheeks
were
flushed
and
who
looked
considerably
worried
replied
that
it
had
been
left
to
her
by
her
own
mother
my
mother
was
a
housekeeper
in
a
nobleman
family
she
said
and
she
was
given
that
cloth
and
two
or
three
more
like
it
i
have
in
the
upstairs
and
i
would
part
with
to
anybody
i
admire
your
pride
said
church
next
door
to
pride
comes
honesty
i
am
sometimes
inclined
to
believe
that
it
comes
afore
pride
but
we
need
dispute
that
delicate
point
at
present
and
the
silver
forks
my
word
tom
my
boy
pass
me
a
fork
to
examine
tom
took
up
a
fork
and
handed
it
to
church
and
all
she
said
she
laid
it
down
with
emphasis
perhaps
you
know
she
said
fixing
her
beady
black
eyes
upon
hopkins
face
that
i
be
very
low
as
regards
victuals
for
the
rest
of
this
week
but
never
mind
i
am
never
one
to
press
what
it
convenient
to
return
ah
and
here
comes
the
dinner
well
i
will
say
that
i
have
a
good
you
can
push
me
right
up
to
the
table
tom
my
boy
tom
did
push
the
old
lady
into
the
most
comfortable
seat
she
now
removed
her
mittens
put
a
napkin
on
her
lap
and
bent
forward
with
a
look
of
appetite
to
regard
the
different
dishes
which
ellen
the
tiny
servant
brought
in
ellen
trembled
very
much
in
the
company
of
the
old
lady
and
hopkins
trembled
still
more
but
susy
who
saw
no
reason
why
she
should
bow
down
before
aunt
church
ate
her
good
dinner
with
appetite
tossed
her
little
head
and
felt
that
she
was
making
a
sensation
tom
was
very
attentive
to
church
and
helped
her
to
a
large
glass
of
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
her
dinner
and
while
she
was
eating
it
forgot
all
about
susy
and
the
cashmere
blouse
but
when
the
meat
had
been
followed
by
the
and
the
by
some
coffee
which
was
served
in
real
china
cups
and
church
had
folded
her
napkin
and
swept
the
crumbs
from
her
bombazine
dress
and
hopkins
assisted
by
susy
had
removed
the
cloth
and
the
little
maid
had
swept
up
the
hearth
church
began
to
recollect
herself
it
is
true
she
was
no
longer
hungry
nor
cold
for
the
fire
was
plentiful
and
the
sun
also
poured
in
at
the
small
window
but
church
had
a
memory
and
as
she
believed
a
grievance
in
her
tiny
house
on
the
common
four
miles
away
firing
was
scarce
and
food
was
scarcer
the
owner
of
the
house
did
not
care
to
spend
more
than
a
very
limited
sum
of
money
on
coals
and
food
there
was
nothing
in
the
cottage
for
church
supper
except
a
bit
of
stale
cake
a
hunch
of
brown
bread
and
a
little
tea
the
tea
would
have
to
be
drunk
without
milk
and
with
only
a
modicum
of
brown
sugar
for
church
was
determined
to
spend
no
money
if
possible
until
hopkins
paid
the
debt
which
had
been
due
on
the
previous
day
it
was
one
thing
therefore
for
church
debtors
to
eat
good
roast
beef
and
good
boiled
pork
and
good
but
it
was
another
thing
for
church
to
tolerate
it
she
fixed
her
eyes
now
on
susy
in
a
very
meaning
way
susy
had
never
appealed
to
the
old
lady
fancy
and
she
appealed
less
than
ever
come
right
over
here
little
girl
said
church
waving
a
thin
arm
and
motioning
susy
to
approach
susy
hopkins
remembering
her
blouse
and
her
proud
position
as
a
member
of
the
cabinet
of
the
queen
of
the
wild
irish
girls
felt
for
a
moment
inclined
to
disobey
but
church
had
a
certain
power
about
her
and
she
impelled
susy
to
come
forward
stand
just
in
front
of
me
she
said
and
let
me
look
at
you
my
word
i
never
did
see
a
more
elegant
figure
do
you
think
that
you
are
something
like
a
peacock
fine
above
and
ugly
below
no
i
do
aunt
church
said
susy
tut
tut
child
do
give
me
any
of
your
sauce
but
just
answer
a
straight
question
where
did
you
get
that
bodice
it
is
singularly
fine
for
a
little
girl
like
you
where
did
you
get
it
i
do
think
it
is
any
business
of
yours
aunt
church
susy
said
her
mother
in
a
voice
of
terror
do
talk
like
that
you
know
very
well
you
must
be
rude
to
aunt
do
mind
her
aunt
she
is
a
very
naughty
girl
i
am
not
mother
said
susy
and
it
awfully
unkind
of
you
to
say
it
of
me
i
am
not
a
bit
rude
but
it
is
not
aunt
church
affair
i
did
steal
the
blouse
i
came
by
it
honestly
and
it
was
bought
out
of
any
of
aunt
church
money
that
remains
to
be
proved
said
church
susan
hopkins
i
like
you
nor
your
ways
when
i
was
young
i
knew
a
little
girl
and
you
remind
me
of
her
she
had
a
face
summat
like
yours
no
way
pretty
but
what
you
call
boastful
and
conceited
and
she
thought
a
sight
of
herself
and
put
on
gay
dress
that
she
had
no
call
to
wear
she
strutted
about
among
the
neighbors
and
they
said
feathers
make
fine
birds
and
laughed
at
her
past
bearing
but
she
did
mind
because
she
was
a
little
girl
that
was
meant
to
go
to
the
bad
and
she
did
she
learned
to
be
a
thief
and
she
broke
her
mother
heart
and
she
was
locked
up
in
prison
in
prison
she
had
to
wear
the
ugly
with
the
stamped
on
all
her
clothes
afterwards
when
she
came
out
again
her
poor
mother
had
died
and
her
grandmother
likewise
and
her
brother
who
was
the
moral
image
of
tom
there
would
receive
her
in
his
house
i
have
heard
of
her
for
a
long
time
back
but
most
likely
she
died
in
the
well
susan
you
may
take
my
little
story
for
what
it
is
worth
and
much
good
may
it
do
you
i
think
you
are
very
rude
indeed
aunt
church
said
susy
i
do
see
that
i
bound
to
submit
to
your
ugly
cruel
words
i
like
this
blouse
and
i
wear
it
whenever
i
wish
oh
said
the
old
lady
impudent
as
well
as
everything
else
that
i
should
live
to
see
it
mary
hopkins
can
it
be
convenient
to
you
to
let
me
have
the
remainder
of
my
hundred
pounds
there
any
contract
but
that
i
could
demand
it
whenever
i
wanted
it
and
it
is
about
convenient
to
me
that
i
should
have
it
back
now
you
owe
me
between
thirty
and
forty
pounds
and
i
like
i
will
say
to
see
the
color
of
my
money
it
ca
be
at
all
to
you
to
give
it
to
me
when
you
can
afford
blouses
of
that
quality
for
your
impudent
young
daughter
real
lace
forsooth
i
know
it
when
i
see
it
we
say
wednesday
week
to
receive
the
money
and
i
will
come
over
in
my
drawn
by
tom
to
take
it
and
i
will
give
tom
a
whole
shilling
for
himself
the
day
i
get
it
back
that
will
be
quite
convenient
to
you
mary
hopkins
wo
it
susy
said
poor
hopkins
for
goodness
sake
leave
the
aunt
church
you
know
perfectly
well
that
i
am
not
responsible
for
the
naughty
ways
of
that
naughty
little
girl
it
apologize
to
you
she
shall
and
that
before
you
leave
this
house
and
you
know
that
if
you
press
me
now
to
return
the
money
in
full
i
have
to
sell
up
the
shop
and
the
children
wo
have
anything
to
eat
and
we
all
be
ruined
you
would
be
as
cruel
as
that
to
your
own
flesh
and
blood
would
you
well
mary
i
only
said
it
to
frighten
you
i
ai
at
all
a
cruel
woman
on
the
contrary
i
am
but
i
ca
stand
the
sauce
of
that
little
girl
of
yours
it
my
opinion
mary
that
the
lost
money
of
yours
is
on
the
back
of
your
susan
and
the
sooner
you
get
her
to
confess
her
sin
the
better
it
will
be
for
us
all
now
before
hopkins
had
time
to
utter
a
word
with
regard
to
this
preposterous
and
appalling
suggestion
of
aunt
church
there
came
a
loud
knock
on
the
little
and
listening
in
the
parlor
the
people
within
could
distinctly
hear
the
rustle
of
silk
petticoats
who
in
the
world
can
that
be
said
hopkins
tom
turned
first
red
and
then
white
and
rushed
into
the
passage
susy
who
had
been
crying
in
the
shop
also
appeared
on
the
scene
i
open
the
door
said
tom
do
wipe
your
eyes
susy
do
let
her
see
you
crying
it
herself
of
course
the
knocker
was
just
going
to
be
applied
to
the
door
again
when
tom
opened
it
with
a
flourish
and
there
stood
waiting
on
the
steps
a
very
brilliant
apparition
this
was
no
less
a
person
than
miss
kathleen
in
her
sunday
best
now
kathleen
tried
to
bear
with
tennant
advice
with
regard
to
her
clothes
in
the
week
but
on
sundays
she
was
absolutely
determined
that
her
love
of
finery
should
find
full
vent
accordingly
from
her
store
of
rich
and
beautiful
garments
she
chose
the
gayest
and
the
most
likely
to
attract
attention
on
the
present
occasion
she
wore
a
crimson
velvet
toque
her
jacket
was
bright
blue
and
she
had
a
skirt
to
match
on
her
neck
she
wore
a
rich
necklet
of
flaming
beads
which
was
extremely
becoming
to
her
and
thrown
carelessly
round
her
neck
and
shoulders
was
a
boa
of
white
fur
and
she
had
a
muff
to
match
altogether
her
radiant
dress
and
radiant
face
were
quite
sufficient
to
dazzle
tom
but
susy
pushed
past
tom
and
held
out
her
hand
oh
kathleen
she
said
i
am
glad
you
have
come
you
best
come
into
the
shop
with
me
there
company
in
the
parlor
and
i
do
think
care
about
it
kathleen
of
course
was
just
as
pleased
to
stay
in
the
shop
with
susy
as
to
go
into
any
other
part
of
the
house
but
just
then
hopkins
put
a
sad
distressed
face
outside
the
door
and
church
voice
was
heard
in
high
and
grating
accents
i
want
to
see
the
person
who
is
talking
in
the
passage
oh
do
go
in
said
susy
it
aunt
church
and
she
dreadful
an
old
lady
cried
kathleen
i
love
old
ladies
she
pushed
past
susy
and
made
her
appearance
in
the
parlor
now
church
was
a
person
of
discernment
she
strongly
objected
to
gay
dress
on
the
person
of
little
susy
hopkins
but
as
she
expressed
it
she
knew
the
quality
had
she
not
lived
all
her
earlier
days
as
housekeeper
to
a
widowed
nobleman
could
she
ever
forget
the
fine
folk
she
helped
to
prepare
for
in
his
house
now
kathleen
standing
in
the
tiny
room
had
a
certain
look
of
wealth
and
distinction
about
her
church
seemed
to
sniff
the
fine
quality
air
in
a
moment
she
even
managed
to
rise
from
her
chair
and
drop
a
little
curtsy
if
it
were
for
the
rheumatics
she
said
i
would
make
so
bold
as
to
sit
before
you
miss
but
why
should
you
i
sorry
you
suffer
from
rheumatism
may
i
bring
a
chair
and
come
and
sit
near
you
are
you
hopkins
susy
hopkins
mother
indeed
my
dear
i
truly
thankful
to
say
i
am
not
and
what
may
your
name
be
my
sweet
young
lady
kathleen
oh
dear
but
it
a
mouthful
i
not
english
said
kathleen
i
irish
do
you
know
in
our
country
we
have
old
ladies
something
like
you
a
good
many
of
them
have
dresses
like
you
and
they
live
in
little
cottages
and
we
bring
them
up
to
the
castle
and
give
them
good
food
very
very
often
there
are
twelve
of
them
and
they
all
live
in
their
tiny
cottages
close
to
each
other
we
make
a
great
fuss
about
them
they
love
to
come
to
the
castle
for
tea
the
castle
said
church
more
and
more
impressed
i
should
think
they
would
like
it
who
would
like
it
it
a
very
great
honor
for
an
old
lady
to
be
entertained
to
her
tea
in
a
castle
and
so
you
live
in
a
castle
my
bonny
young
lady
yes
my
father
owns
carrigrohane
castle
eh
love
it
is
a
mouthful
of
a
word
for
me
to
get
round
my
lips
but
never
mind
it
is
but
to
look
at
you
to
see
how
beautiful
and
good
you
are
and
you
are
beautiful
too
said
kathleen
i
mean
you
are
beautiful
for
an
old
lady
i
love
the
beauty
of
the
old
but
i
want
to
see
hopkins
and
i
want
to
see
susy
susy
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
church
opened
her
eyes
very
wide
her
mouth
formed
itself
into
a
round
o
an
eager
exclamation
was
about
to
burst
from
her
lips
but
she
restrained
herself
and
a
very
good
little
girl
susan
hopkins
is
she
said
after
a
moment
pause
and
a
particularly
great
friend
of
mine
being
so
to
speak
my
mary
my
dear
call
your
little
girl
in
hopkins
in
some
trepidation
crossed
the
room
and
called
to
susy
who
was
still
sulking
in
the
shop
my
visitor
and
all
she
kept
saying
and
i
wanted
to
have
her
all
to
myself
i
had
such
a
lot
to
say
to
her
i
never
saw
anybody
quite
so
horrible
as
aunt
church
is
never
mind
susy
never
mind
said
her
mother
the
young
lady
is
pleasing
your
aunt
like
anything
and
she
has
sent
for
you
come
along
in
susan
this
minute
called
out
church
come
my
pet
and
let
have
a
little
talk
go
susy
and
be
quick
about
it
said
her
mother
by
the
aid
of
tom
and
hopkins
who
pushed
susy
from
behind
she
was
induced
to
the
little
parlor
there
indeed
all
things
had
changed
kathleen
called
to
her
made
room
for
her
on
the
same
chair
and
held
her
hand
church
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
only
too
well
did
she
see
the
difference
between
them
one
was
a
rather
plain
little
girl
the
daughter
of
her
own
relation
the
other
was
a
lady
beautiful
stately
and
magnificently
dressed
i
know
her
kind
thought
aunt
church
i
have
aired
beds
for
quality
of
that
sort
and
i
have
watched
them
when
they
danced
in
the
big
ballroom
and
watched
them
too
when
their
sweethearts
came
along
and
seen
oh
yes
many
many
things
have
i
seen
and
many
many
things
have
i
heard
of
those
fair
young
ladies
of
quality
she
belongs
to
them
and
she
likes
that
pert
little
susy
hopkins
yet
it
matter
to
me
susy
shall
have
my
good
graces
if
she
has
secured
those
of
miss
kathleen
accordingly
church
changed
her
tactics
she
praised
susy
in
honeyed
words
to
the
visitor
a
good
little
girl
miss
and
deserving
of
anything
that
those
who
are
better
off
can
do
for
her
she
is
a
great
help
to
her
mary
hopkins
come
nigh
dear
you
are
very
fond
of
your
susy
are
you
of
course
i
am
said
hopkins
in
an
affectionate
voice
susy
longed
to
keep
up
her
anger
but
she
could
not
she
was
soon
smiling
and
flushing
and
what
a
neat
little
bodice
my
susy
is
wearing
said
church
and
bought
with
her
own
savings
you
would
think
so
would
you
miss
it
gives
her
great
credit
said
kathleen
in
a
calm
voice
i
like
people
to
wear
smart
clothes
do
you
church
if
you
lived
on
our
estate
i
would
dress
you
myself
i
love
to
see
our
old
ladies
gaily
dressed
on
christmas
day
they
come
to
the
castle
and
have
dinner
as
well
as
tea
it
is
wonderful
how
smart
they
look
they
are
very
lucky
ladies
very
lucky
said
church
they
wear
old
bombazine
like
this
do
they
your
dress
suits
you
very
well
indeed
said
kathleen
but
my
old
ladies
wear
velveteen
dresses
they
save
them
of
course
we
do
want
them
to
be
extravagant
but
they
always
come
up
to
the
castle
in
velveteen
dresses
with
white
caps
and
white
collars
round
their
necks
and
they
look
very
nice
they
have
a
happy
time
i
am
sure
they
have
miss
yes
they
have
a
very
happy
time
they
want
for
nothing
there
was
an
old
lady
belonging
to
our
house
who
left
a
certain
sum
of
money
and
the
old
ladies
get
it
between
them
they
get
six
shillings
a
week
each
and
a
dear
little
house
to
live
in
we
are
obliged
to
supply
them
with
as
much
coal
as
they
want
and
candles
and
a
new
pair
of
blankets
on
the
first
of
every
november
and
a
bale
of
unbleached
calico
on
the
first
of
may
you
ca
think
how
comfortable
they
are
and
then
of
course
we
throw
in
a
lot
of
extra
things
the
black
velveteen
dresses
and
other
garments
of
the
same
quality
it
must
be
a
wonderful
place
to
live
in
is
it
very
difficult
to
get
into
one
of
these
houses
missy
i
do
know
would
you
like
to
come
that
i
would
i
write
to
father
and
ask
him
if
you
may
miss
it
would
be
wonderful
you
be
very
picturesque
amongst
them
said
kathleen
gazing
at
church
with
a
critical
eye
and
you
have
so
much
to
tell
them
because
all
the
rest
are
irish
and
they
have
never
gone
beyond
their
own
country
but
you
have
seen
such
a
lot
of
life
have
you
miss
i
ca
express
all
the
tales
i
could
tell
i
lived
with
the
quality
for
so
long
i
lived
with
lord
henshel
until
he
died
i
was
housekeeper
there
oh
i
could
tell
them
lots
of
things
it
would
be
very
nice
if
you
came
over
and
i
am
almost
sure
there
is
a
cottage
vacant
said
kathleen
in
a
contemplative
voice
it
seems
unfair
to
give
the
cottages
entirely
to
irish
people
we
might
have
one
english
old
lady
you
would
enjoy
it
you
have
such
a
lovely
view
and
you
might
keep
your
own
little
pig
if
you
liked
church
was
not
enamored
with
the
idea
of
keeping
a
pig
perhaps
fowls
would
do
as
well
she
said
i
have
a
great
fancy
for
birds
and
i
am
fond
of
eggs
fowls
will
do
just
as
well
said
kathleen
rising
now
carelessly
from
her
seat
well
church
i
will
write
to
father
and
let
you
know
if
there
is
a
vacancy
and
you
could
come
back
with
me
in
the
summer
could
you
oh
miss
it
would
be
heaven
ca
we
go
out
and
have
a
walk
now
susy
said
kathleen
who
found
the
small
parlor
a
little
too
close
for
her
taste
susy
rushed
upstairs
put
on
her
outdoor
jacket
and
a
cheap
hat
and
trying
to
hide
the
holes
in
her
gloves
ran
downstairs
kathleen
however
was
the
last
girl
to
notice
any
want
in
her
wardrobe
she
had
all
her
life
been
so
abundantly
supplied
with
clothes
that
although
she
loved
to
array
herself
in
fine
garments
the
want
of
them
in
others
never
attracted
her
attention
susy
she
said
the
moment
they
got
out
of
doors
what
is
the
matter
with
ruth
craven
with
ruth
craven
said
susy
who
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
waste
her
time
over
such
an
uninteresting
person
yes
you
must
go
to
her
house
you
must
insist
on
seeing
her
and
you
must
find
out
and
let
me
know
what
is
wrong
she
has
written
me
a
most
mysterious
letter
she
has
actually
asked
me
to
let
her
withdraw
from
our
society
ruth
of
all
people
it
is
very
queer
of
her
said
susy
not
to
be
grateful
and
pleased
for
she
is
no
better
than
the
rest
of
us
no
better
than
the
rest
of
you
susy
said
kathleen
raising
her
brows
in
surprise
but
indeed
you
are
mistaken
the
rest
of
you
are
not
a
patch
on
her
she
is
my
prime
minister
i
ca
allow
her
to
resign
oh
well
said
susy
if
you
think
of
her
in
that
way
of
course
i
think
of
her
in
that
way
susy
i
like
you
very
much
and
i
want
to
be
kind
to
everybody
but
to
compare
you
or
mary
rand
or
rosy
myers
or
any
of
the
others
with
ruth
craven
but
she
is
no
better
she
is
a
great
deal
better
she
is
refined
and
beautiful
she
go
i
ca
allow
it
but
she
has
written
me
such
a
queer
letter
and
implored
and
besought
of
me
not
to
come
to
see
her
that
i
am
forced
to
accede
to
her
wishes
so
you
will
have
to
go
to
her
and
tell
her
that
she
must
meet
me
on
my
way
to
school
tell
her
that
i
will
go
a
bit
of
the
way
towards
her
house
tell
her
that
i
will
be
at
the
white
cross
corner
at
a
quarter
to
nine
you
need
say
more
oh
susy
it
would
break
my
heart
if
ruth
did
not
continue
to
be
a
member
of
our
society
i
will
do
what
you
want
of
course
said
susy
i
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
kathleen
it
was
so
kind
of
you
to
come
to
see
us
this
afternoon
you
will
keep
your
promise
and
come
and
have
tea
with
us
wo
you
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
am
afraid
i
ca
i
do
wish
i
had
a
home
of
my
own
and
then
i
ask
you
to
have
tea
with
me
but
susy
how
funnily
you
were
dressed
now
that
i
come
to
think
of
it
you
did
look
odd
that
blouse
is
too
smart
for
the
coarse
blue
serge
skirt
you
were
wearing
i
know
it
is
but
i
ca
afford
a
better
skirt
mother
is
rather
worried
about
money
just
now
i
know
i
ought
to
tell
you
but
she
is
and
do
you
know
before
you
came
in
aunt
church
was
so
horrid
she
got
quite
dreadful
about
the
blouse
and
she
tried
to
make
out
that
i
had
stolen
the
money
from
mother
to
buy
it
was
it
awful
of
her
i
can
tell
you
it
was
a
blessing
when
you
came
in
you
changed
her
altogether
what
did
you
do
to
her
well
said
kathleen
i
rather
like
old
ladies
and
she
struck
me
as
something
picturesque
she
a
horrid
old
thing
and
not
a
bit
picturesque
i
hate
her
like
poison
that
is
very
wrong
of
you
susy
some
day
you
will
get
old
yourself
and
you
wo
like
people
to
hate
you
well
that
a
long
way
off
i
need
worry
about
it
yet
cried
susy
i
do
hate
her
very
much
indeed
and
then
you
know
when
you
appeared
she
began
to
butter
me
up
like
anything
i
hated
that
the
worst
of
all
i
am
sorry
she
is
that
sort
of
old
lady
said
kathleen
after
a
pause
but
i
have
promised
to
try
and
get
her
into
one
of
our
almshouses
it
would
be
rare
fun
to
have
her
there
but
she
is
not
a
bit
poor
she
ought
to
go
into
an
almshouse
if
she
is
rich
said
susy
of
course
she
must
go
into
an
almshouse
if
she
is
rich
but
she
does
look
rich
she
is
quite
rich
i
think
she
has
saved
three
hundred
pounds
you
must
call
that
rich
i
afraid
i
do
said
kathleen
susy
was
silent
for
a
moment
there
are
so
many
different
views
about
riches
she
said
at
last
i
am
glad
you
are
so
tremendously
rich
that
you
think
nothing
of
three
hundred
pounds
mother
and
i
often
sigh
and
pine
even
for
pound
for
instance
now
but
i
must
tell
you
it
would
not
be
right
perhaps
aunt
church
will
be
a
little
nicer
to
me
now
that
you
have
taken
her
up
i
threaten
to
complain
to
you
if
she
does
behave
here
susy
laughed
merrily
that
all
right
susan
said
kathleen
i
must
go
back
now
for
i
have
promised
to
go
for
a
walk
with
tennant
no
one
ever
thinks
about
her
as
she
ought
to
be
thought
of
so
i
have
some
plans
in
my
head
for
her
too
oh
my
head
is
full
of
plans
and
i
do
wish
yes
i
do
susy
that
i
could
make
a
lot
of
people
happy
you
are
a
splendid
girl
said
susy
i
wish
there
were
others
like
you
in
the
world
no
i
am
not
splendid
said
kathleen
her
lovely
dark
eyes
looking
wistful
i
have
heaps
and
lashons
of
faults
but
i
do
like
to
make
people
happy
i
always
did
since
i
was
a
little
child
the
person
i
am
most
anxious
about
at
present
is
ruth
i
love
ruth
so
very
much
you
will
be
sure
to
see
her
this
evening
wo
you
sure
and
certain
said
susy
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
kathleen
you
have
made
a
great
difference
in
my
life
the
two
girls
parted
just
by
the
turnstile
kathleen
passed
through
on
her
way
across
the
common
to
tennant
house
and
susy
went
slowly
back
to
the
high
street
and
the
little
stationer
shop
she
found
church
in
the
act
of
being
deposited
in
her
and
tom
looking
proud
and
flushed
attending
on
her
hopkins
was
also
standing
just
outside
the
shop
putting
a
wrap
round
the
old
lady
and
tucking
her
up
when
susy
appeared
her
mother
called
out
to
her
come
along
you
ungrateful
girl
here
aunt
church
going
and
wondering
why
you
have
deserted
her
during
the
last
hour
that
just
like
you
mary
hopkins
said
old
church
you
scold
when
there
no
occasion
to
and
you
withhold
scolding
when
it
due
i
do
blame
your
daughter
susan
for
going
out
with
that
nice
young
lady
i
am
only
too
pleased
to
think
that
any
daughter
of
yours
should
be
taken
notice
of
by
a
young
lady
of
the
miss
kathleen
type
a
splendid
girl
and
to
tell
you
the
honest
truth
none
of
you
are
fit
for
her
to
touch
you
with
a
pair
of
tongs
dear
dear
said
susy
but
she
has
touched
me
pretty
often
i
think
you
ought
to
say
nasty
things
of
that
sort
aunt
church
for
if
you
do
i
may
be
able
to
aunt
church
fixed
her
glittering
black
eyes
on
susan
come
here
child
she
said
susy
went
up
to
her
somewhat
unwillingly
my
bark
is
worse
than
my
bite
said
old
church
now
look
here
if
you
bring
that
charming
young
lady
to
see
me
and
give
me
notice
a
day
or
so
before
tom
can
run
over
and
tell
me
if
you
and
tom
and
miss
kathleen
would
come
and
have
tea
at
my
place
why
it
the
freshest
of
the
plumcakes
we
have
not
the
stalest
and
the
microscope
should
be
out
handy
and
in
order
and
with
some
prepared
plates
that
my
poor
husband
used
which
i
have
never
shown
to
anybody
from
the
time
of
his
death
i
have
a
too
that
i
can
put
into
the
microscope
it
will
make
you
see
the
root
of
a
hair
on
your
head
and
i
will
whisper
susy
susy
somewhat
unwillingly
bent
forward
i
will
give
you
five
shillings
you
like
to
trim
your
hat
to
match
that
handsome
blouse
would
you
susy
eyes
could
not
help
dancing
five
shillings
all
to
yourself
and
i
wo
press
your
mother
about
the
installment
which
was
due
to
me
yesterday
i
manage
without
it
somehow
but
i
want
to
see
that
beautiful
young
lady
in
my
cottage
and
you
will
get
the
money
when
you
bring
her
that
all
you
are
a
queer
little
girl
and
not
altogether
to
my
taste
but
you
are
no
fool
susy
stood
silent
she
put
her
hand
on
the
cushion
of
the
old
bent
forward
and
looked
into
church
face
will
you
take
back
the
words
you
said
will
i
take
back
what
if
not
the
words
at
least
the
thought
will
you
say
that
you
know
that
i
got
this
blouse
honestly
oh
yes
child
i
quite
forgotten
all
about
it
now
just
see
that
you
do
what
i
want
and
the
sooner
the
better
you
understand
and
oh
susy
mum
the
word
with
regard
to
me
being
well
off
i
ai
i
can
tell
you
i
am
quite
a
poor
body
but
i
could
do
a
kindness
to
you
and
your
mother
if
if
certain
things
were
to
come
to
pass
now
that
about
pull
away
tom
my
boy
i
have
a
rosy
apple
which
shall
find
its
way
into
your
pocket
if
you
take
me
home
in
time
tom
pulled
with
a
will
the
little
creaked
and
groaned
and
church
nodded
her
wise
old
head
and
she
was
carried
over
the
country
roads
meanwhile
susy
entered
the
house
with
her
mother
what
a
blessing
said
hopkins
that
that
pretty
young
lady
happened
to
call
i
never
saw
such
a
change
in
any
one
as
what
took
place
in
your
aunt
after
she
had
seen
her
well
mother
you
know
what
it
is
all
about
said
susy
aunt
church
wants
to
get
into
one
of
those
almshouses
just
like
her
stingy
old
thing
said
hopkins
i
do
want
her
to
get
in
i
can
tell
you
mother
and
when
kathleen
and
i
were
out
i
told
kathleen
that
she
was
a
great
deal
too
rich
she
asked
me
what
her
means
were
and
i
said
i
believed
she
has
three
hundred
pounds
put
by
now
mother
do
you
call
that
riches
three
hundred
pounds
said
hopkins
that
depends
child
to
some
it
is
wealth
to
others
it
is
a
decent
competence
to
others
again
it
is
poverty
kathleen
did
think
much
of
it
mother
well
said
hopkins
i
have
notions
in
my
head
maybe
this
very
thing
can
be
turned
to
good
for
us
there
no
saying
i
think
if
your
aunt
was
sure
and
certain
to
get
into
one
of
those
almshouses
she
might
do
a
good
turn
to
you
susy
and
she
sure
and
certain
to
help
tom
a
little
but
there
we
ca
look
into
the
future
i
am
tired
out
with
one
thing
and
another
susan
my
dear
child
where
did
you
get
that
beautiful
blouse
i
did
get
it
through
theft
mother
if
that
what
you
are
thinking
of
i
got
it
honestly
and
i
am
not
obliged
to
tell
and
what
more
i
wo
tell
hopkins
sighed
dear
dear
she
said
and
she
sat
down
in
the
which
church
had
occupied
and
stared
into
the
fire
i
am
not
nearly
as
as
i
was
she
said
after
a
pause
if
miss
kathleen
will
do
something
for
aunt
church
it
stands
to
reason
that
aunt
church
wo
be
hard
on
us
susy
made
no
answer
to
this
she
stood
quiet
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
she
went
slowly
upstairs
she
removed
the
beautiful
blouse
and
put
on
a
common
one
she
then
wrapped
herself
in
an
old
waterproof
cloak
for
the
sunshiny
morning
had
developed
into
an
evening
of
thick
clouds
and
threatening
rain
and
went
downstairs
where
in
the
world
are
you
going
said
her
mother
in
a
fretful
tone
i
did
think
you
sit
quietly
with
me
and
learn
your
collect
if
you
are
going
out
it
ought
to
be
to
church
i
do
see
what
call
you
have
to
be
going
anywhere
else
on
sunday
evening
i
want
to
see
ruth
craven
do
keep
me
please
it
is
very
important
but
i
do
know
who
ruth
craven
is
oh
mother
i
thought
every
one
knew
her
she
is
the
very
very
pretty
little
granddaughter
of
old
craven
who
lives
in
that
cottage
close
to
the
station
a
handsome
old
man
too
said
hopkins
but
i
confess
i
know
anything
about
him
well
he
and
his
old
wife
have
got
this
one
beautiful
grandchild
and
she
has
joined
the
foundationers
at
the
great
shirley
school
miss
kathleen
has
taken
up
with
her
as
well
as
with
me
and
other
foundation
girls
and
instead
of
having
a
miserable
dull
life
we
are
extremely
likely
to
have
the
best
life
of
any
girls
in
the
school
anyhow
i
have
a
message
for
ruth
and
i
promised
to
deliver
it
all
right
child
do
be
longer
away
than
you
can
help
susy
left
the
house
the
distance
from
her
mother
shop
to
the
cottage
was
a
matter
of
ten
minutes
quick
walking
she
soon
reached
her
destination
walked
up
the
little
path
which
led
to
the
tiny
cottage
and
tapped
with
her
fingers
on
the
door
the
door
was
opened
for
her
by
old
craven
craven
was
in
her
sunday
best
and
looked
a
very
beautiful
and
almost
aristocratic
old
lady
do
you
want
my
grandchild
she
said
observing
susy
size
and
dress
yes
is
she
within
asked
susy
no
dear
she
has
gone
to
church
would
you
like
to
wait
in
for
her
or
would
you
rather
go
and
meet
her
she
has
gone
to
james
the
less
the
church
just
around
the
corner
you
know
it
yes
i
know
it
said
susy
they
be
coming
out
now
said
craven
looking
up
at
the
clock
which
stood
in
the
passage
if
you
go
and
stand
by
the
principal
entrance
you
are
safe
to
see
her
thank
you
said
susy
you
are
sure
you
would
rather
wait
in
the
house
no
really
mother
expects
me
back
my
name
is
susan
hopkins
my
mother
keeps
the
stationer
shop
in
the
high
street
to
be
sure
said
craven
gently
i
know
the
shop
quite
well
susy
said
and
then
stepped
down
the
little
path
what
a
humble
abode
the
prime
favorite
ruth
craven
lived
in
susy
own
home
was
a
palace
in
comparison
ruth
lived
in
a
cottage
which
was
little
better
than
a
workman
cottage
there
ca
be
more
than
two
bedrooms
upstairs
thought
susy
and
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
certainly
there
ca
be
more
than
one
the
old
lady
looked
very
nice
but
of
course
she
is
quite
a
common
person
i
should
love
to
be
prime
minister
to
kathleen
and
why
should
there
be
such
a
fuss
made
about
ruth
i
only
wish
the
post
was
mine
should
i
do
a
lot
could
i
help
mother
and
tom
and
all
of
us
and
there
is
that
stupid
little
ruth
oh
dear
oh
dear
well
i
suppose
i
must
give
her
the
message
she
hurried
her
steps
as
these
last
thoughts
came
to
her
and
presently
she
stood
outside
the
principal
entrance
of
the
little
church
james
the
less
was
by
no
means
remarkable
for
beauty
of
architecture
or
adornment
of
any
sort
nevertheless
the
vicar
was
a
man
of
great
eloquence
and
earnestness
and
in
the
evenings
it
was
the
custom
for
the
little
church
to
be
packed
the
sermon
came
to
an
end
the
voluntary
rolled
forth
from
the
organ
and
the
crowd
of
worshippers
poured
out
susy
stretched
out
her
hand
and
clutched
that
of
a
slim
girl
who
was
following
in
the
train
of
people
ruth
it
is
me
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
ruth
face
until
susy
touched
her
had
been
looking
like
a
piece
of
heaven
itself
so
calm
and
serene
were
the
eyes
and
so
beautiful
the
expression
which
lingered
round
her
lips
now
she
seemed
to
awaken
and
pull
herself
together
she
did
not
attempt
to
avoid
susy
but
slipping
out
of
the
crowd
of
people
who
were
leaving
the
church
she
found
herself
by
the
girl
side
come
just
a
little
way
home
with
me
said
susy
it
wo
take
me
long
to
say
what
i
want
to
say
she
linked
her
hand
in
her
companion
as
she
spoke
yes
there
was
little
doubt
of
it
ruth
was
lovable
one
forgot
her
low
birth
her
low
surroundings
when
one
looked
at
her
susy
had
heard
of
those
few
people
of
rare
character
and
rare
natures
who
are
as
it
is
expressed
nature
ladies
there
are
nature
gentlemen
as
well
and
ladies
and
nature
gentlemen
are
above
mere
external
circumstances
they
are
above
the
mere
money
worth
or
the
mere
accident
of
birth
now
ruth
belonged
to
this
rare
class
and
susy
without
quite
understanding
it
felt
it
she
forgot
the
humble
little
house
the
lack
of
rooms
and
the
workmanlike
appearance
of
the
whole
place
she
said
in
a
deferential
tone
i
have
come
to
you
from
kathleen
you
have
done
something
which
has
distressed
her
very
much
she
wants
you
to
meet
her
at
the
white
cross
corner
on
your
way
to
school
she
wants
you
to
be
there
at
a
quarter
to
nine
that
is
all
ruth
you
will
be
sure
to
attend
i
promised
kathleen
most
faithfully
that
i
would
deliver
her
message
she
is
very
unhappy
about
something
i
do
know
what
you
have
done
to
vex
her
but
i
do
said
ruth
and
i
ca
help
going
on
vexing
her
but
what
is
it
said
susy
whose
curiosity
was
suddenly
awakened
you
might
tell
me
i
wish
you
would
i
ca
tell
you
susan
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
it
is
a
matter
between
kathleen
and
myself
very
well
i
will
meet
her
there
is
no
use
in
shirking
things
susan
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
and
give
me
kathleen
message
chapter
xiv
ruth
resigns
the
premiership
the
next
morning
kathleen
was
downstairs
betimes
she
ran
into
the
kitchen
and
suggested
to
maria
that
she
should
help
her
to
toast
the
bread
maria
who
was
somewhat
lazy
and
who
had
already
begun
to
appreciate
kathleen
extreme
handed
her
the
and
pointed
to
a
heap
of
bread
which
lay
cut
and
ready
for
toasting
on
the
deal
table
in
the
center
of
the
kitchen
dear
me
miss
kathleen
she
said
if
only
miss
alice
was
as
as
you
why
the
house
would
go
on
wheels
i
often
helped
the
servants
at
home
said
kathleen
why
is
alice
she
made
contrairy
i
expect
miss
cut
on
the
cross
i
call
it
said
cook
who
came
forward
at
this
juncture
and
offered
a
chair
to
kathleen
well
if
that
the
case
i
sorry
for
her
said
kathleen
it
must
be
very
unpleasant
to
feel
sort
of
and
all
the
time
it
is
what
you
ever
feel
miss
said
cook
with
an
admiring
glance
at
the
young
lady
kathleen
fixed
her
roguish
eyes
on
the
good
woman
face
no
she
said
i
do
think
i
am
by
the
way
cook
would
you
like
a
black
silk
apron
embroidered
with
violets
to
wear
when
you
have
done
all
your
dirty
work
in
the
kitchen
cooks
do
wear
black
silk
aprons
embroidered
with
violets
was
the
good
woman
answer
but
this
cook
might
if
a
nice
irish
girl
who
has
plenty
of
money
gave
it
to
her
i
have
it
in
the
bottom
of
my
trunk
i
asked
aunt
katie
to
send
it
to
me
for
your
mistress
but

mistress

for
it
i
will
give
it
to
you

little
toque

a
young
man
maria
most
girls
have
have
they
would
you
like
to
walk
out
with
him
in
a
toque
trimmed
with
it
puts
me
all
in
a
flutter
to
think
of
it
miss
said
maria
i
am
sure
a
sweeter
young
lady
never
came
into
this
house
kathleen
chatted
on
to
the
retainers
as
she
called
cook
and
maria
until
she
had
toasted
enough
bread
she
then
went
into
the
alice
was
there
looking
pale
and
headachy
the
day
was
a
very
cold
one
and
the
fire
was
by
no
means
bright
kathleen
intensely
rosy
cheeks
for
the
fire
had
considerably
scorched
them
attracted
attention
i
do
wish
you
would
do

work
she
said

me
terribly

the
way

two

is
worth
while
alice
if
they
all
like
me
why
should
you
alice
made
no
reply
kathleen
stood
still
for
a
moment
then
she
glanced
at
the
clock
it
was
a
quarter
past
eight
she
must
be
out
of
the
house
in
a
little
over
a
quarter
of
an
hour
if
she
was
to
meet
ruth
craven
at
the
white
cross
corner
she
sat
down
to
the
table
helped
herself
to
a
piece
of
toast
and
spread
some
butter
on
it
a
cup
of
tea
please
alice
she
oh

david

dave

exquisite
it
was
alice
place
to
pour
out
the
tea
she
poured
some
out
now
very
unwillingly
for
kathleen
who
drew
the
cup
towards
her
stirred
it
absently
and
began
to
read
her
letters
presently
she
uttered
a
little
shriek
it
is
from
aunt
katie
and
she
is
crossing
the
channel
the
darling
colleenoge
she
is
coming
to
london
and
she
wants
me
to
see
her
oh

it
was
aunt
katie
who
sent
me
that
wonderful
trunk
of
clothes
wo

a
time
now

declare
i
scarcely

on
my
head

in
the
fun
for

the
heart
of

or

mind
our
lessons
i
am
trying
for
my
scholarship

i
do
suppose
even
if
your
aunt
is
coming
at
a
most
inopportune
time
that
she
is
going
to
upset
everything
that
remains
to
be
proved
said
kathleen
i
am
not
going
to

close
to

without

my
bit
of
fun
oh

kathleen
did
not
wait
for
alice
answer
she
dashed
upstairs
and
on
the
first
landing
she
met
tennant
who
had
been
suffering
from
headache
and
was
in
consequence
a
little
late
for
breakfast
tennant
shouted
kathleen
i
have
the
top
of
the
morning
as
far
as
news
is
concerned
it
is
herself
that
is
crossing
the
briny
be
in
london
oh
did
you
ever
hear
of
anything
quite
so
scrumptious
but

wish
you
would
wear
that
really
good
dress
going
to
school

it
my
old
lavender
and
my
old
satin
blouse
said
kathleen
looking
down
at
herself
with
a
momentary
glance
ah

my
dear
tired
one
it
is

be
thinking
of
when
aunt

is
in
london

maria

she
tells
me
and
would

a
few
fine

naturally
the
creature
well
tennant
it
herself
that
is
crossing
as
i
said
even
now
she
is
in
the
big
steamer
coming
nearer
and
nearer
to
england
sha
we
have
fun
when
she
arrives
you
have
told
me

listening

the
dear
woman
who
sent
me
the
box
full
of
new
clothes
aunt
katie
at
your
service
but
there
i
must
be
off
i
think
of
it
all
day
and
it
will
make
me
so
happy
kathleen
dashed
away
to
her
own
room
put
on
her
outdoor
things
and
a
moment
or
two
later
was
running
as
fast
as
she
could
in
the
direction
of
the
white
cross
corner
there
she
saw
a
silent
girl
very
quietly
dressed
standing
waiting
for
her
here
i
am
said
kathleen
and
here
you
stand
ruth
and
now
what
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
i
am
sorry
said
ruth
i
thought
when
you
sent
susy
to
me
with
your
message
that
i
might
as
well
come
here
this
morning
but
i
changed
my
mind
not
a
bit
of
it
kathleen
eyes
always
extraordinarily
dark
for
blue
eyes
now
grew
almost
black
a
flash
of
real
anger
shot
through
them
do
you
think
it
is
rather
mean
she
said
to
give
me
up
when
you
promised
to
belong
to
me
to
give
me
up
altogether
and
to
go
with
those
dreadful
proud
paying
girls
it
is
that
said
ruth
and
you
know
it
it
is
just
this
i
belong
to
two
sides
cassandra
weldon
offers
me
an
advantage
which
i
dare
not
throw
away
it
is
most
essential
to
me
to
win
the
scholarship
if
i
win
it
i
shall
be
properly
educated
when
i
leave
school
i
be
able
to
take
the
position
my
dear
father
had
he
lived
would
have
wished
for
me
i
shall
be
able
to
support
granny
and
grandfather
you
see
for
yourself
kathleen
that
i
ca
refuse
it
it
is
a
question
of
choice
it
is
a
question
of
necessity
i
love
you
kathleen
i
will
always
love
you
and
be
faithful
to
you
but
i
give
up
the
scholarship
i
do
want
you
to
said
kathleen
but
why
should
you
belong
to
me
and
yet
take
the
scholarship
i
do
want
you
to
be
with
me
all
the
time
you
can
go
to
that
horrible
detestable
girl
when
it
is
necessary
and
have
your
odious
coach
to
post
you
up
but
i
want
you
more
than
anybody
else

you
know
how
i
love
you
ca
you
do
both
think
it
over
ruth
i
have
thought
it
over
and
i
ca
do
it
i
would
if
i
could
but
it
is
to
be
done
it
would
be
right
to
you
nor
right
to
cassandra
well
i
think
you
are
very
mean
i
think
i
hate
you
kathleen
turned
aside
she
was
impulsive
and
defiant
but
where
her
passions
were
concerned
her
heart
was
very
soft
she
burst
into
tears
now
and
flung
her
arms
around
ruth
neck
i
like
a
lot
of
people
she
said
i
like
tennant
and
even
susy
although
she
not
up
to
much
and
two
or
three
other
girls
but
i
only
you
in
the
whole
of
england
i
only
love
you
and
you
are
going
to
give
me
up
no
i
will
still
be
your
friend
but
you
have
refused
to
join
my
society
you
have
refused
to
belong
to
the
wild
irish
girls
i
ca
help
myself
but
you
promised
i
know
i
did
i
made
a
mistake
kathleen
there
is
no
help
for
it
i
shall
love
you
even
if
i
do
belong
to
the
society
now
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
ruth
disentangled
herself
from
kathleen
embrace
and
putting
wings
to
her
feet
ran
in
the
direction
of
the
school
kathleen
stood
just
where
she
had
left
her
over
her
face
was
passing
a
rapid
and
curious
change
do
i
love
her
any
longer
she
said
to
herself
oh
i
think
i
think
i
love
her
still
but
she
has
slighted
me
she
will
be
sorry
some
day
oh
dear
the
only
girl
in
the
whole
of
england
that
i
love
has
slighted
me
she
has
thrown
ridicule
upon
me
she
said
that
she
would
be
my
prime
minister
and
she
has
resigned
everything
for
that
horrible
cassandra
she
will
be
sorry
yet
i
know
she
will
chapter
xv
the
scholarship
trouble
is
brewing
over
some
of
the
girls
of
the
great
shirley
school
there
passed
that
morning
a
curious
wave
of
excitement
those
girls
who
had
joined
kathleen
society
were
almost
now
more
or
less
in
a
state
of
tension
once
a
week
they
were
to
meet
in
the
quarry
once
a
week
whatever
the
weather
in
the
dead
of
night
they
were
to
meet
in
this
sequestered
spot
they
knew
well
that
if
they
were
discovered
they
would
run
a
very
great
chance
of
being
expelled
from
the
school
for
although
they
were
day
scholars
yet
integrity
of
conduct
was
essential
to
their
maintaining
their
place
in
that
great
school
which
gave
them
so
liberal
an
education
in
some
cases
without
any
fees
in
all
other
cases
with
very
small
ones
one
of
the
great
ideas
of
the
school
was
to
encourage
brave
actions
unselfish
deeds
nobility
of
mind
those
girls
who
possessed
any
talent
or
any
specially
strong
characteristic
had
every
chance
offered
to
them
in
the
great
shirley
school
their
futures
were
more
or
less
assured
for
the
governors
of
the
school
had
powers
to
give
grants
to
the
clever
girls
to
award
scholarships
for
which
all
might
compete
and
to
encourage
industry
honesty
and
charitable
ideas
as
far
as
possible
kathleen
when
she
entered
the
school
and
started
her
society
had
not
the
slightest
idea
that
while
she
was
trying
to
help
the
foundationers
she
was
really
leading
them
into
very
grave
mischief
but
several
of
the
foundationers
themselves
knew
this
nevertheless
the
fun
of
the
whole
thing
the
particular
fascination
which
kathleen
herself
exercised
over
her
followers
kept
them
her
undeniable
slaves
and
not
for
the
world
would
any
of
them
have
left
her
now
that
they
had
sworn
fealty
to
her
cause
so
kathleen
had
thought
when
she
left
the
house
that
morning
but
as
she
entered
the
school
she
knew
that
one
girl
and
that
the
girl
whom
she
most
cared
for
had
decided
to
choose
the
thorny
path
which
led
far
from
kathleen
and
her
company
in
addition
to
everything
else
she
is
quite
mean
thought
the
little
girl
and
during
that
morning
lessons
she
occupied
herself
far
more
in
flashing
angry
glances
in
the
direction
of
ruth
one
minute
and
at
cassandra
the
next
than
in
attending
to
what
she
was
about
kathleen
had
been
given
much
by
nature
her
father
was
a
very
rich
man
she
had
been
brought
up
with
great
freedom
but
also
with
certain
bold
liberal
ideas
as
regards
the
best
in
life
and
conduct
she
was
a
very
beautiful
girl
and
she
was
and
amiable
as
for
her
talents
she
had
a
certain
charm
which
does
more
for
a
woman
than
any
amount
of
ordinary
ability
and
she
had
a
passionate
and
great
love
for
music
musical
genius
was
already
spoken
of
with
much
approbation
by
the
rest
of
the
school
the
girls
used
to
ask
her
to
improvise
kathleen
could
improvise
in
almost
any
style
in
almost
any
fashion
she
could
make
the
piano
sob
with
her
notes
and
again
she
could
bring
forth
music
clear
and
again
she
would
lead
the
tender
and
solemn
strains
of
the
march
and
again
she
would
dance
over
the
keys
so
lightly
so
ravishingly
that
the
girls
kept
time
with
their
feet
to
her
notes
the
music
mistress
was
anxious
that
kathleen
should
try
for
a
musical
scholarship
and
she
had
some
ideas
of
doing
so
herself
but
she
felt
cross
and
even
her
music
was
at
fault
i
ca
do
it
she
said
looking
miss
spicer
full
in
the
face
it
means
such
drudgery
and
i
do
believe
i
play
a
bit
better
if
i
did
that
is
certainly
not
the
case
kathleen
said
miss
spicer
knowledge
must
be
of
assistance
you
have
great
talent
if
you
add
to
that
real
musical
knowledge
you
can
do
almost
anything
but
i
do
think
i
much
care
to
i
can
play
on
the
piano
to
imitate
any
birds
that
ever
sung
at
home
and
father
loves
that
i
can
play
all
the
to
make
mother
cry
and
i
can
play
oh
such
dance
music
for
aunt
katie
it
does
matter
that
i
should
know
more
does
it
i
ca
agree
with
you
it
would
be
a
very
great
pleasure
to
me
if
i
saw
you
presented
with
a
musical
scholarship
would
it
said
kathleen
glancing
at
the
thin
and
careworn
face
of
the
music
teacher
you
do
know
what
it
would
mean
to
me
answered
miss
spicer
it
is
seldom
that
one
has
the
pleasure
of
teaching
real
talent
and
i
say
how
refreshing
it
is
to
me
to
hear
you
play
as
you
do
but
i
want
you
to
improve
i
want
you
to
be
a
credit
to
me
i
like
to
please
you
of
course
said
kathleen
she
spoke
gently
and
then
she
added
but
there
is
only
one
piano
at
the
tennants
and
that
is
in
the
and
alice
or
the
boys
or
tennant
are
always
there
i
have
not
many
opportunities
to
practice
i
live
in
the
same
terrace
said
miss
spicer
eagerly
and
my
piano
is
hardly
ever
used
if
you
only
would
come
and
make
use
of
it
there
is
a
fire
in
my
and
you
could
come
at
any
hour
whenever
you
have
a
fancy
will
you
it
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
me
you
are
very
kind
yes
i
will
come
kathleen
bent
towards
the
music
mistress
and
somewhat
to
that
astonishment
printed
a
kiss
on
her
forehead
the
kiss
went
right
down
into
miss
spicer
somewhat
frozen
heart
immediately
after
school
that
day
cassandra
held
out
her
hand
to
ruth
ruth
went
up
to
her
gravely
well
ruth
she
said
have
you
decided
i
hope
you
have
you
told
me
you
would
let
me
know
i
have
cassandra
said
ruth
kathleen
who
was
standing
not
far
away
suddenly
darted
forward
and
stood
within
a
foot
of
the
two
girls
have
you
really
decided
ruth
she
said
her
tone
was
imperious
ruth
felt
her
gentle
heart
beat
high
she
turned
and
looked
with
dignity
first
at
kathleen
and
then
at
cassandra
i
will
join
you
cassandra
she
kathleen
i
told
you
this
morning
what
my
decision
was
and
i
hate
you
said
kathleen
she
tossed
her
head
and
walked
away
cassandra
waited
until
she
was
out
of
hearing
you
look
very
pale
dear
ruth
she
said
come
home
with
me
you
ruth
did
not
speak
cassandra
laid
her
hand
on
her
arm
why
you
are
trembling
she
said
what
has
that
horrid
girl
done
to
you
nothing
nothing
but
she
has
please
cassie
she
is
not
horrid
oh
well
we
wo
discuss
her
she
is
not
my
sort
wo
you
come
and
have
lunch
with
me
and
we
can
arrange
everything
you
are
going
to
take
advantage
of
mother
offer
i
ca
help
myself
it
is
much
too
good
to
be
refused
it
means
i
ca
tell
you
what
it
means
to
me
cassie
if
i
can
only
get
a
scholarship
i
shall
be
able
to
help
grandfather
and
yet
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
very
nearly
declining
it
i
do
think
i
should
ever
have
spoken
to
you
again
if
you
had
even
so
i
was
very
nearly
declining
it
for
you
know
i
could
not
have
accepted
your
offer
and
been
friends
with
kathleen
in
the
way
she
wants
me
to
be
now
i
am
very
fond
of
kathleen
and
if
i
could
please
myself
i
would
retain
her
friendship
but
you
know
grandfather
has
lost
some
more
money
he
heard
about
it
two
nights
ago
and
that
made
me
make
up
my
mind
of
course
i
love
you
cassie
i
have
loved
you
ever
since
i
came
to
the
school
you
have
been
so
very
very
kind
to
me
but
had
i
the
choice
i
would
have
stayed
with
kathleen
well
it
is
all
a
mystery
to
me
said
cassandra
i
do
like
kathleen
i
will
frankly
say
so
i
do
think
she
has
a
good
influence
in
the
school
that
sort
of
very
rich
popular
girl
always
makes
mischief
it
is
far
better
for
the
school
not
to
have
anybody
like
her
in
its
midst
she
has
the
power
of
attracting
people
but
she
has
also
the
power
of
making
enemies
it
is
my
opinion
she
will
get
into
very
serious
trouble
before
she
leaves
great
shirley
school
i
shall
be
sorry
for
her
of
course
but
what
do
you
mean
what
sort
of
trouble
can
she
get
into
there
are
whispers
about
her
that
i
do
quite
understand
but
if
it
were
known
that
she
does
lead
other
girls
astray
she
would
be
had
up
before
the
governors
and
then
she
would
not
find
herself
in
a
very
pleasant
position
ruth
did
not
say
anything
her
face
turned
white
cassandra
glanced
at
her
uttered
a
quick
sigh
and
resumed
whether
you
like
it
or
not
i
am
glad
you
are
out
of
the
whole
thing
i
should
hate
you
to
get
into
trouble
you
are
so
clever
and
so
different
from
the
others
that
you
are
certain
to
succeed
and
now
let
us
hurry
home
i
must
tell
you
all
about
our
scheme
you
must
come
to
me
every
day
miss
renshaw
will
be
with
us
each
evening
from
six
to
seven
oh
you
do
know
how
happy
you
are
making
me
ruth
smiled
and
tried
to
look
cheerful
weldon
came
out
to
meet
the
two
girls
as
they
entered
the
pretty
little
cottage
her
face
was
smiling
ah
cassandra
she
said
now
you
will
be
happy
yes
ruth
has
accepted
our
offer
indeed
i
have
weldon
said
ruth
and
i
scarcely
know
how
to
thank
you
come
in
dear
and
have
some
cassandra
i
have
just
heard
from
miss
renshaw
and
she
is
coming
this
you
can
either
stay
ruth
when
dinner
is
over
or
come
back
again
i
will
come
back
said
ruth
granny
is
not
very
well
and
i
ought
not
to
have
left
her
even
to
have
dinner
here
but
i
could
help
myself
cassandra
brought
her
friend
into
the
house
they
had
a
pleasant
meal
together
and
ruth
tried
to
forget
that
she
had
absolutely
quarrelled
with
kathleen
and
that
kathleen
heart
was
on
her
account
but
kathleen
herself
was
determined
not
to
give
way
to
any
real
feelings
of
misery
on
account
of
ruth
desertion
i
have
no
time
to
think
about
it
she
said
to
herself
when
she
returned
to
the
house
she
found
a
telegram
waiting
for
her
she
tore
it
open
it
was
from
aunt
katie
i
have
arrived
come
and
have
dinner
with
me
at
the
métropole
and
bring
any
friend
you
like
what
a
lark
thought
kathleen
and
what
a
chance
for
ruth
if
only
she
had
been
different
oh
dear
i
suppose
i
must
ask
alice
to
come
with
me
whom
is
your
telegram
from
dear
asked
tennant
coming
up
to
her
at
that
moment
alice
was
standing
in
the
devouring
a
book
of
greek
history
she
held
it
close
to
her
eyes
which
were
rather
it
from
aunt
katie
she
has
come
the
darling
said
kathleen
she
wants
me
to
go
to
london
to
dine
with
her
of
course
i
you
will
come
with
me
wo
you
alice
she
says
i
am
to
bring
some
one
no
i
ca
come
said
alice
and
for
that
matter
no
more
can
you
it
takes
quite
minutes
to
get
to
charing
cross
and
then
you
have
to
get
to
the
métropole
we
girls
are
not
allowed
to
go
to
london
by
ourselves
as
if
that
mattered
it
matters
to
me
if
it
does
not
to
you
anyhow
here
is
a
note
for
you
it
is
from
miss
ravenscroft
our
i
rather
fancy
that
will
decide
matters
kathleen
tore
open
the
note
which
alice
had
handed
to
her
she
read
the
following
words
dear
miss
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
come
round
to
see
me
at
six
this
evening
i
have
something
of
importance
to
say
to
you
what
can
she
mean
said
kathleen
i
scarcely
know
miss
ravenscroft
i
just
spoke
to
her
the
first
day
i
went
to
the
school
she
has
asked
me
too
what
can
it
be
about
said
alice
then
you
can
take
a
message
from
me
i
am
not
going
said
kathleen
what
cried
alice
i
do
think
even
you
will
dare
to
defy
the
why
my
dear
kathleen
you
will
never
get
over
it
this
is
mother
do
speak
to
her
what
is
it
dear
said
tennant
coming
forward
alice
explained
and
kathleen
says
she
wo
go
of
course
i
wo
go
dear
tennant
on
the
contrary
you
and
i
will
go
together
to
see
aunt
katie
she
is
my
aunt
and
i
would
slight
her
for
all
the
world
she
never
forgive
you
can
tell
miss
ravenscroft
alice
that
my
aunt
has
come
to
see
me
and
that
i
have
been
obliged
to
go
to
town
you
can
manage
it
quite
easily
kathleen
did
not
wait
for
any
further
discussion
but
ran
out
of
the
room
i
do
wish
mother
you
try
and
persuade
her
said
alice
i
am
sure
whatever
her
father
may
be
he
ca
want
her
to
come
to
school
here
to
get
into
endless
scrapes
there
is
some
mystery
afoot
and
miss
ravenscroft
has
got
wind
of
it
i
know
she
has
because
i
have
heard
it
from
one
or
two
of
the
girls
but
what
mystery
what
can
you
mean
said
tennant
i
do
know
myself
said
alice
but
it
has
something
to
do
with
kathleen
and
a
curious
influence
she
has
over
the
foundation
girls
i
know
kathleen
is
popular
with
the
mistresses
that
puzzles
me
said
tennant
for
i
never
met
a
more
charming
girl
i
know
you
think
so
but
you
see
mere
charm
of
manner
does
go
down
in
a
great
school
like
ours
of
course
i
am
sorry
for
her
and
i
quite
understand
that
she
does
want
to
disappoint
her
aunt
but
she
ought
to
come
with
me
she
ought
mother
i
have
the
slightest
influence
over
her
but
you
have
i
do
think
she
would
willingly
do
anything
to
annoy
you
well
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
she
is
a
wayward
child
i
am
sorry
that
miss
ravenscroft
expects
her
to
go
to
see
her
as
she
is
so
devoted
to
her
aunt
and
would
enjoy
seeing
her
tennant
left
the
room
and
alice
went
steadily
on
with
her
preparations
she
wondered
why
her
mother
did
not
come
back
presently
she
looked
at
the
clock
it
wanted
a
quarter
to
six
dear
me
i
must
go
upstairs
now
and
fetch
kathleen
she
will
have
to
tidy
herself
and
i
must
try
to
persuade
her
not
to
put
on
anything
thought
alice
she
rushed
upstairs
she
opened
the
bedroom
door
the
bedroom
was
empty
where
can
she
be
thought
alice
there
were
signs
of
kathleen
late
presence
in
the
shape
of
a
tie
flung
on
the
bed
a
hat
tossed
by
its
side
an
open
drawer
revealing
brushes
and
combs
laces
and
colored
ties
and
no
end
of
gloves
handkerchiefs
but
not
the
girl
herself
she
really
is
a
great
trial
thought
alice
i
suppose
she
has
gone
with
mother
to
town
i
wonder
mother
yields
to
her
kathleen
will
get
into
a
serious
scrape
at
the
school
that
certain
alice
went
to
her
own
part
of
the
room
which
was
full
of
order
and
method
she
opened
a
drawer
substituted
a
clean
collar
for
the
one
she
had
been
wearing
during
the
day
brushed
out
her
hair
neatly
put
on
her
and
a
small
black
coat
snatched
up
a
pair
of
gloves
and
ran
downstairs
on
the
way
she
met
tennant
oh
mother
cried
the
girl
where
is
kathleen
i
did
find
her
in
her
room
and
i
wondered
what
had
become
of
her
where
is
she
said
tennant
i
thought
she
was
going
with
you
i
had
a
long
talk
with
her
she
did
not
say
much
but
she
seemed
quite
gentle
and
not
at
all
cross
i
kissed
her
and
said
that
i
would
go
with
her
to
london
to
see
her
aunt
or
that
she
might
ask
miss
here
i
am
sorry
you
did
that
mother
well
darling
it
seemed
the
only
thing
to
do
and
the
child
took
it
very
well
is
she
going
with
you
she
said
she
would
be
at
all
long
getting
ready
she
is
not
in
her
room
mother
i
ca
imagine
what
has
happened
to
her
tennant
ran
upstairs
in
some
alarm
kathleen
had
certainly
flown
the
disordered
state
of
the
room
gave
evidence
of
this
and
then
on
a
nearer
view
tennant
found
a
tiny
piece
of
paper
pinned
in
conventional
fashion
to
the
she
took
it
up
and
read
gone
to
london
to
aunt
katie
well
she
is
a
naughty
girl
how
troublesome
i
must
follow
her
of
course
said
tennant
really
this
is
provoking
oh
mother
it
is
worth
while
fretting
about
her
she
is
quite
hopeless
said
alice
but
there
i
must
make
the
best
of
it
to
miss
ravenscroft
only
i
am
sure
she
will
be
very
angry
with
kathleen
alice
flew
to
the
school
she
was
met
by
a
teacher
who
asked
her
where
she
was
going
to
see
miss
ravenscroft
replied
alice
i
had
a
note
asking
me
to
call
at
six
do
you
know
anything
about
it
miss
purcell
perhaps
she
wants
to
question
you
about
miss
there
is
some
commotion
in
the
school
in
connection
with
her
she
seems
to
be
displeasing
some
of
those
in
authority
kathleen
had
a
note
too
asking
her
to
call
then
it
must
be
about
her
but
where
is
she
is
she
going
with
you
alice
threw
up
her
hands
do
ask
me
she
said
perhaps
the
less
i
say
the
better
i
am
late
as
it
is
i
wo
keep
you
now
miss
purcell
alice
ran
the
rest
of
the
way
she
entered
the
great
school
and
knocked
at
the
front
entrance
this
door
was
never
opened
except
to
the
and
her
visitors
after
a
time
an
elderly
servant
answered
her
summons
i
am
alice
tennant
said
the
young
girl
and
i
have
come
at
miss
ravenscroft
request
to
see
her
oh
yes
miss
certainly
she
said
she
was
expecting
two
young
ladies
well
i
am
one
of
them
can
you
let
her
know
step
in
here
miss
alice
was
shown
into
a
small
a
moment
later
the
servant
returned
will
you
follow
me
miss
she
said
they
went
down
a
passage
and
entered
a
brightly
and
cheerfully
furnished
there
was
a
fire
in
the
grate
and
electric
light
made
all
things
as
bright
as
day
a
tall
lady
with
hair
combed
back
from
a
massive
forehead
and
beautifully
dressed
in
long
clinging
garments
of
deep
purple
stood
on
the
hearth
round
her
neck
was
a
collar
of
old
mechlin
lace
she
wore
cuffs
of
the
same
with
ruffles
at
the
wrist
her
hands
were
small
and
white
she
had
one
massive
diamond
ring
on
the
third
finger
this
lady
was
the
great
miss
ravenscroft
the
head
of
the
school
one
of
the
most
persuasive
most
fascinating
and
most
influential
teachers
in
the
whole
realm
of
girlhood
her
opinion
was
asked
by
anxious
mothers
and
fathers
and
guardians
the
girls
whom
she
took
into
her
own
house
and
helped
with
her
own
counsel
were
thought
the
luckiest
in
england
even
alice
who
was
reckoned
a
good
girl
as
good
girls
go
had
never
before
come
in
personal
contact
with
miss
ravenscroft
the
superintended
the
management
of
every
girl
in
the
school
but
she
did
not
show
herself
except
when
she
read
prayers
in
her
deep
musical
voice
morning
after
morning
or
when
something
very
special
occurred
miss
ravenscroft
did
not
smile
when
alice
appeared
nor
did
she
hold
out
her
hand
she
bowed
very
slightly
and
then
dropped
into
a
chair
and
pointed
to
another
for
the
girl
to
take
you
are
alice
tennant
yes
madam
you
are
in
the
upper
fifth
yes
said
alice
again
i
have
had
very
good
reports
of
you
from
miss
purcell
and
miss
dove
and
others
you
will
probably
be
in
the
sixth
next
year
i
hope
so
it
will
be
a
very
great
delight
to
me
alice
trembled
and
colored
looked
down
and
then
looked
up
again
miss
ravenscroft
was
regarding
her
with
kindly
eyes
hers
was
a
sort
of
veiled
face
she
seldom
gave
way
to
her
feelings
part
of
her
power
lay
in
her
potential
attitudes
in
the
possibilities
which
she
seldom
except
on
very
rare
occasions
exhibited
to
their
fullest
extent
alice
felt
that
she
had
only
approached
the
extreme
edge
of
miss
nature
miss
ravenscroft
was
silent
for
a
minute
then
she
said
gently
and
your
friend
kathleen
i
wrote
to
her
also
why
is
she
here
i
am
very
sorry
indeed
said
alice
it
is
my
fault
we
wo
talk
of
faults
if
you
please
alice
tennant
i
asked
you
why
your
friend
is
here
i
must
explain
she
is
my
friend
she
lives
with
mother
i
mean
she
boards
with
mother
why
is
she
here
she
got
your
letter
i
suppose
she
did
understand
she
is
so
new
to
schools
she
is
not
coming
not
coming
but
i
commanded
i
know
i
tried
to
explain
but
she
is
new
to
school
and
and
spoilt
she
must
be
miss
ravenscroft
was
silent
for
a
minute
we
will
defer
the
subject
of
kathleen
until
i
have
the
pleasure
of
speaking
to
her
she
said
then
but
now
as
you
are
here
i
should
like
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
yes
what
you
say
alice
tennant
will
not
be
i
speak
in
judicial
phrase
here
miss
ravenscroft
gave
vent
to
a
faint
smile
used
against
you
i
should
like
to
have
what
information
you
can
give
me
there
is
a
disturbing
element
in
this
school
do
you
know
anything
about
it
nothing
absolutely
but
you
agree
with
me
that
there
is
a
disturbing
element
i
am
afraid
i
do
it
has
been
traced
to
kathleen
alice
was
silent
it
is
influencing
a
number
of
girls
who
can
be
very
easily
impressed
and
who
form
a
very
important
part
of
this
school
special
arrangements
were
made
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
by
the
founders
of
the
school
that
they
should
receive
an
education
in
every
way
calculated
to
help
them
in
life
the
influence
to
which
i
allude
undermines
these
good
things
it
must
therefore
be
put
a
stop
to
and
the
first
way
to
put
a
stop
to
anything
of
the
sort
is
to
discover
all
about
it
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
know
all
that
is
to
be
known
with
regard
to
the
unruly
condition
of
the
foundationers
of
the
great
shirley
school
the
person
who
can
doubtless
tell
me
most
is
kathleen
the
mere
fact
of
her
defying
my
authority
and
refusing
to
come
to
see
me
when
she
is
summoned
shows
that
she
is
insubordinate
as
far
as
this
school
is
concerned
alice
sat
very
still
she
has
not
chosen
to
appear
and
i
wish
to
take
quick
and
instant
steps
can
you
help
me
i
could
said
alice
that
is
of
course
i
live
in
the
same
house
with
her
but
i
would
much
rather
not
you
will
in
no
way
be
blamed
but
it
is
absolutely
essential
that
you
should
give
me
your
assistance
i
am
authorized
to
ask
for
it
i
shall
see
kathleen
but
from
what
you
say
and
from
what
i
have
heard
i
am
greatly
shocked
to
have
to
say
it
but
i
think
it
possible
that
she
may
not
be
induced
to
tell
the
exact
truth
if
therefore
you
notice
anything
if
anything
is
brought
to
your
ears
which
i
ought
to
know
you
must
come
to
me
at
once
do
not
suppose
that
i
want
you
to
be
a
spy
in
this
matter
but
what
is
troubling
the
school
must
be
discovered
and
within
the
next
few
days
now
you
understand
remember
that
what
i
have
said
to
you
is
said
in
the
interest
of
the
school
and
absolutely
behind
closed
doors
you
are
not
to
repeat
it
to
anybody
you
can
go
now
alice
tennant
personally
i
am
pleased
with
you
i
like
your
manner
i
hear
good
accounts
of
your
attention
to
lessons
in
pleasing
me
you
will
please
the
governors
of
the
school
and
doubtless
be
able
to
help
yourself
and
your
mother
a
most
worthy
lady
in
the
long
run
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
said
alice
you
have
spoken
kind
words
to
me
but
what
you
have
set
me
to
do
is
not
at
all
to
my
taste
it
seems
scarcely
fair
for
i
must
say
that
i
do
like
kathleen
she
and
i
have
never
got
on
it
seems
scarcely
fair
that
i
should
be
the
one
to
run
her
to
earth
the
fairness
or
the
unfairness
of
the
question
is
not
now
to
be
discussed
said
miss
ravenscroft
she
rose
as
she
spoke
you
are
unfortunately
in
the
position
of
her
most
intimate
friend
she
continued
for
you
and
she
live
in
the
same
house
regard
what
you
have
to
do
as
an
unpleasant
duty
and
do
consider
yourself
in
any
way
responsible
for
being
forced
into
the
position
which
one
would
not
as
a
rule
advocate
the
simplest
plan
is
to
get
the
girl
herself
to
make
a
full
confession
to
me
but
in
any
case
you
understand
must
chapter
xvi
kathleen
takes
ruth
to
town
when
kathleen
ran
upstairs
her
heart
was
bubbling
over
with
the
first
real
fierce
anger
she
had
almost
ever
felt
in
her
life
she
was
a
spirited
daring
girl
but
she
also
had
a
sweet
temper
now
her
anger
was
roused
her
heart
beat
fast
she
clenched
one
of
her
hands
oh
if
i
had
alice
here
would
i
give
it
to
her
she
said
to
herself
if
i
had
that
detestable
miss
ravenscroft
here
would
i
give
her
a
piece
of
my
mind
how
dare
she
order
me
about
am
i
not
kathleen
of
carrigrohane
is
not
my
father
a
sort
of
king
in
old
ireland
and
what
is
she
i
prove
to
her
that
i
defy
her
i
will
go
to
see
aunt
katie
nothing
shall
keep
me
back
carried
away
by
the
wild
wave
of
passion
which
consumed
her
kathleen
dressed
hastily
for
her
expedition
she
was
indifferent
now
as
to
what
she
wore
she
put
on
the
first
which
came
to
hand
buttoned
a
rough
jacket
over
her
velvet
dress
snatched
up
her
purse
which
lay
in
a
drawer
and
without
waiting
for
either
gloves
or
necktie
ran
downstairs
and
out
of
the
house
i
will
go
i
have
the
slightest
idea
how
i
am
to
get
there
but
i
will
go
to
aunt
katie
i
shall
be
in
the
train
and
far
enough
away
before
they
have
discovered
that
i
have
gone
was
her
thought
from
tennant
house
to
the
station
was
the
best
part
of
a
mile
but
kathleen
was
fleet
of
foot
and
soon
accomplished
the
distance
she
was
just
arriving
at
the
station
when
she
saw
ruth
craven
coming
to
meet
her
ruth
had
enjoyed
her
hour
with
miss
renshaw
and
was
altogether
in
high
spirits
kathleen
stopped
for
a
minute
oh
ruth
she
said
will
you
come
to
town
with
me
it
would
be
so
nice
if
you
would
i
am
going
to
meet
aunt
katie
it
would
not
be
a
bit
wrong
of
you
to
come
do
come
do
ruthie
but
i
ca
in
this
dress
said
ruth
who
felt
suddenly
very
much
tempted
of
course
you
can
why
aunt
katie
is
such
a
darling
she
take
us
out
if
we
want
things
and
buy
them
on
the
spot
and
what
does
dress
matter
we
be
back
in
no
time
what
time
does
your
grandmother
expect
you
home
oh
i
do
know
i
told
granny
i
did
not
exactly
know
what
time
i
should
be
back
but
she
certainly
would
expect
me
to
be
out
late
never
mind
you
are
doing
me
a
kindness
i
must
go
to
see
aunt
katie
and
it
is
convenient
for
the
tennants
to
go
with
me
if
we
go
together
it
wo
be
a
bit
remarkable
do
come
ruthie
you
hurt
my
feelings
awfully
this
morning
you
need
hurt
them
again
very
well
said
ruth
i
do
know
london
at
all
and
i
should
like
to
go
with
you
the
two
girls
now
turned
into
the
railway
station
kathleen
gave
a
puzzled
glance
around
her
for
a
minute
then
walked
boldly
up
to
a
porter
asked
him
to
direct
her
to
the
proper
place
to
book
for
london
he
showed
her
the
right
and
she
secured
two
single
tickets
for
herself
and
ruth
the
girls
were
directed
to
the
right
platform
and
in
process
of
time
found
themselves
in
the
train
it
so
happened
that
they
had
a
compartment
to
themselves
kathleen
had
now
quite
got
over
her
burst
of
anger
and
was
in
the
highest
spirits
this
is
fun
she
said
it
is
so
awfully
nice
to
have
met
you
do
you
know
that
miss
ravenscroft
the
great
unknown
as
we
wild
irish
girls
call
her
had
the
cheek
to
send
me
a
letter
ruth
looked
attentive
and
grave
she
wanted
me
to
go
and
see
her
at
six
well
it
is
six
now
and
she
will
have
to
whistle
for
me
ruth
darling
you
know
how
pretty
you
look
and
even
though
you
have
deserted
me
and
wo
join
my
darling
beloved
society
yet
i
shall
always
love
you
here
kathleen
seated
herself
near
ruth
and
flung
one
arm
around
her
waist
but
said
ruth
disentangling
herself
from
kathleen
embrace
you
do
mean
that
miss
ravenscroft
miss
wanted
you
to
go
and
see
her
and
you
did
go
no
i
did
go
why
should
i
go
miss
ravenscroft
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
me
oh
kathleen
she
is
your
mistress
the
of
the
great
shirley
school
well
and
what
about
that
aunty
my
darling
my
own
dear
sweet
aunt
katie
sent
me
a
telegram
to
meet
her
in
town
she
is
at
the
hôtel
métropole
ruth
do
you
know
where
it
is
i
have
the
most
remote
idea
oh
well
we
get
there
somehow
never
mind
now
do
look
so
worried
i
shall
be
sorry
i
asked
you
to
come
with
me
if
you
look
any
graver
but
you
make
me
feel
grave
kathleen
said
ruth
oh
kathleen
i
ca
tell
how
you
puzzle
me
of
course
i
know
that
you
are
very
pretty
and
fascinating
and
that
lots
and
lots
of
girls
love
you
and
will
always
love
you
you
are
a
sort
of
queen
in
the
school
perhaps
you
are
not
the
greatest
queen
but
still
you
are
a
queen
and
you
could
lead
the
whole
school
that
would
be
rather
fun
said
kathleen
but
you
have
to
change
a
good
bit
you
have
to
be
just
as
fascinating
just
as
pretty
but
different
somehow
i
mean
oh
do
tell
me
what
you
mean
and
be
quick
we
be
in
london
before
long
you
would
disobey
miss
ravenscroft
if
you
were
to
be
our
real
queen
then
i
not
be
your
queen
darling
for
i
shall
disobey
miss
ravenscroft
when
it
comes
to
a
case
of
obliging
her
or
dear
darling
precious
aunty
ruth
said
no
more
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
was
very
much
distressed
she
was
sorry
for
her
own
sake
that
she
had
met
kathleen
and
that
she
was
going
with
her
to
london
but
on
the
other
hand
she
was
glad
that
she
was
with
the
girl
who
by
herself
might
have
got
into
a
serious
scrape
finally
the
two
found
themselves
standing
very
forlorn
and
slightly
frightened
on
one
of
the
big
platforms
at
charing
cross
now
what
are
we
to
do
said
kathleen
we
must
ask
the
way
of
course
was
ruth
answer
here
is
a
porter
who
looks
kind
she
went
up
to
the
man
have
you
any
luggage
in
the
van
miss
was
the
immediate
inquiry
no
she
answered
ruth
was
quietly
although
shabbily
dressed
but
she
had
on
gloves
a
neat
hat
and
a
neat
necktie
kathleen
had
on
a
very
shabby
coat
a
most
unsuitable
cap
of
velvet
on
her
clustering
masses
of
curls
and
no
necktie
and
no
gloves
what
could
be
the
matter
with
the
pretty
young
lady
thought
the
man
ruth
spoke
in
her
gentle
tones
we
want
to
go
to
see
a
lady
at
the
hôtel
métropole
she
said
which
is
the
hôtel
métropole
oh
miss
it
is
quite
close
you
have
only
to
go
out
of
the
station
take
the
second
turning
to
your
left
walk
down
northumberland
avenue
and
you
be
there
but
where
is
northumberland
avenue
we
do
know
anything
about
london
interrupted
kathleen
if
you
will
allow
me
to
put
you
two
ladies
into
a
cab
the
cabman
will
take
you
to
the
hôtel
métropole
it
only
a
step
away
but
you
better
drive
if
you
do
know
your
london
we
have
never
been
in
our
london
before
said
kathleen
in
a
voice
of
intense
pleasure
they
now
tripped
confidently
along
by
the
side
of
the
porter
he
took
them
into
the
yard
outside
the
station
and
called
a
no
no
one
of
those
things
said
the
little
girl
a
hansom
was
summoned
and
the
children
were
put
in
the
driver
was
directed
to
take
them
to
the
métropole
and
they
started
off
ah
said
kathleen
looking
with
great
appreciation
around
her
ah
the
lights
are
they
just
lovely
and
see
see
that
water
that
must
be
the
thames
oh
ruth
may
we
stand
up
in
the
hansom
we
could
see
ever
so
much
better
standing
no
sit
down
implored
ruth
why
surely
you
are
not
frightened
there
never
was
any
sort
of
conveyance
that
would
frighten
me
i
wish
i
might
drive
that
horse
instead
of
the
stupid
old
jehu
on
the
box
is
london
a
perfect
place
oh
this
is
lovely
is
it
ruth
thank
goodness
i
not
always
bothered
by
that
dreadful
speaking
voice
inside
me
that
you
seem
to
have
got
said
kathleen
here
the
cab
drew
up
with
a
jerk
at
the
métropole
how
much
are
we
to
pay
you
asked
kathleen
the
man
was
honest
and
asked
the
customary
shilling
a
porter
was
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
hotel
he
flung
the
doors
wide
and
the
two
entered
presently
a
man
came
up
and
asked
kathleen
what
she
wanted
the
hour
was
just
before
dinner
and
the
wide
hall
of
the
hotel
was
full
both
men
and
women
turned
and
stared
at
the
children
both
were
extremely
pretty
kathleen
almost
startlingly
so
but
what
about
the
gloveless
little
hands
and
the
untidy
neck
and
throat
please
said
kathleen
we
have
come
to
see
my
aunt
miss
she
is
here
is
she
the
man
said
he
would
inquire
and
went
to
the
bureau
yes
he
said
after
a
minute
pause
will
you
come
to
the
young
ladies
he
conducted
the
children
down
some
wide
passages
covered
with
thick
turkey
carpets
opened
the
folding
doors
of
a
great
and
left
them
to
themselves
there
was
a
minute
or
two
of
agonized
terror
on
the
part
of
ruth
of
suspense
and
rapid
as
far
as
kathleen
was
concerned
and
then
a
deep
mellow
ringing
voice
was
heard
and
miss
katie
entered
the
apartment
why
i
never
she
cried
the
top
of
the
morning
to
you
my
honey
god
bless
you
my
darling
oh
it
is
joy
to
kiss
your
sweet
face
again
a
little
lady
all
smiles
and
dimples
all
curls
and
necklaces
and
gay
clothing
extended
two
arms
wide
and
clasped
them
round
kathleen
neck
ah
aunty
said
kathleen
this
is
good
and
i
ran
away
to
see
you
i
did
darling
i
did
i
have
got
into
the
most
awful
scrape
nobody
knows
what
will
happen
see
me
without
gloves
and
without
a
necktie
and
this
dear
little
girl
one
of
my
chosen
friends
ruth
craven
has
come
with
me
ah
now
how
sweet
of
her
said
miss
turning
to
kiss
me
my
darling
why
then
you
are
as
welcome
as
though
you
were
the
core
of
my
heart
for
being
so
kind
to
my
sweet
come
to
the
light
kathleen
asthore
and
let
me
look
at
you
but
it
is
as
rosy
you
are
as
you
used
to
be
it
a
bit
pale
and
pulled
down
you
look
do
you
like
england
my
dear
if
you
do
like
it
all
at
all
it
home
you
will
come
with
me
to
the
old
castle
and
the
old
country
now
then
children
sit
by
me
and
let
have
a
talk
we
have
a
good
meal
presently
and
then
i
have
a
bit
of
a
thought
in
the
back
of
my
head
which
i
think
will
please
you
both
sit
here
anyway
for
the
present
and
let
us
collogue
to
our
hearts
content
miss
katie
and
her
two
young
charges
as
she
told
the
girls
she
considered
them
drew
a
good
deal
of
attention
as
they
sat
and
talked
together
the
little
lady
was
not
young
but
was
certainly
very
fascinating
she
had
a
vivacious
merry
smile
the
keenest
most
brilliant
black
eyes
in
the
world
and
a
certain
grace
and
dignity
about
her
which
seemed
to
contrast
with
her
rapid
utterances
and
intensely
genial
manner
dinner
was
announced
and
the
three
went
into
the
great
miss
ordered
a
small
table
and
they
sat
down
together
ruth
felt
unhappy
she
keenly
desired
to
go
home
again
she
was
more
and
more
certain
that
she
had
done
wrong
to
listen
to
kathleen
persuasions
but
kathleen
was
enjoying
herself
to
the
utmost
she
was
an
irish
girl
again
sitting
close
to
one
of
her
very
own
she
forgot
the
dull
school
and
the
dreadfully
dreary
house
where
she
now
lived
she
absolutely
forgot
that
such
a
person
as
miss
ravenscroft
existed
she
ceased
almost
to
remember
the
society
of
the
wild
irish
girls
was
she
not
kathleen
the
only
daughter
of
the
house
of
the
heiress
of
her
beloved
father
old
castle
for
some
day
she
would
be
mistress
of
carrigrohane
castle
some
day
she
would
be
a
great
lady
on
her
own
account
now
kathleen
ideas
of
what
a
great
lady
should
be
were
in
themselves
very
sensible
and
noble
a
great
lady
should
do
her
utmost
to
make
others
happy
she
should
dispense
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
she
should
make
as
many
people
as
possible
happy
her
retainers
should
feel
certain
that
they
dwelt
in
her
heart
she
should
love
the
soil
of
her
native
land
with
a
passion
which
nothing
could
undermine
or
weaken
the
sons
of
the
soil
should
be
her
brothers
her
kinsmen
the
daughters
of
the
soil
should
be
her
sisters
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
but
not
only
should
the
great
lady
of
carrigrohane
love
her
irish
friends
but
men
and
women
both
youths
and
children
but
she
should
love
others
who
needed
her
help
there
never
was
a
more
affectionate
more
girl
than
kathleen
but
of
she
had
little
or
no
knowledge
and
those
who
crossed
her
will
had
yet
to
find
that
kathleen
would
not
obey
for
she
was
fearless
defiant
resolute
in
short
a
rebel
born
and
bred
ruth
sat
silent
perplexed
and
anxious
in
the
midst
of
the
gay
feast
kathleen
and
aunt
katie
laughed
and
almost
shouted
in
their
mirth
occasionally
people
turned
to
glance
at
the
trio
the
grave
refined
extremely
pretty
but
shabbily
dressed
girl
the
radiant
child
and
the
vivacious
little
lady
who
might
be
her
mother
but
who
scarcely
looked
as
if
she
was
it
was
a
curious
party
for
such
a
room
and
for
such
surroundings
i
think
said
ruth
suddenly
forgive
me
kathleen
but
i
think
we
ought
to
be
looking
out
a
train
to
go
back
by
indeed
and
that
you
wo
said
miss
you
are
going
to
stay
with
me
why
do
you
think
i
let
this
precious
darling
child
back
again
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
you
must
stay
here
too
what
is
your
name
oh
ruth
i
can
get
you
a
room
here
and
you
shall
have
a
fire
and
every
comfort
i
at
least
must
go
home
said
ruth
my
grandfather
and
grandmother
will
be
sitting
up
for
me
oh
nonsense
child
said
miss
i
can
send
a
commissionaire
down
to
tell
your
grandfather
that
i
am
keeping
you
for
the
night
of
course
ruth
said
kathleen
do
be
silly
it
is
absurd
for
you
to
go
on
like
that
and
for
my
part
i
should
love
to
stay
i
am
sorry
kathleen
said
ruth
but
i
must
go
home
perhaps
one
of
the
porters
can
tell
me
when
there
is
a
train
to
merrifield
i
must
go
back
for
grandfather
would
be
terrified
if
i
did
go
home
you
of
course
must
please
yourself
my
dear
child
leave
it
to
me
said
miss
you
ca
possibly
go
back
neither
you
nor
my
sweet
pet
kathleen
oh
i
arrange
it
dear
do
you
be
frightened
you
could
go
so
late
by
yourself
it
would
be
right
miss
however
had
not
come
in
contact
with
a
character
like
ruth
before
she
could
be
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
it
was
in
that
light
miss
chose
to
consider
her
conduct
i
must
go
she
said
i
ca
by
any
possibility
stay
do
ruth
for
my
sake
pleaded
kathleen
tears
in
her
eyes
no
kathleen
not
even
for
your
sake
and
i
think
added
ruth
that
you
ought
to
come
with
me
it
would
be
much
better
for
you
to
see
miss
ravenscroft
in
the
morning
and
explain
matters
to
her
nonsense
said
kathleen
now
speaking
with
decided
temper
that
is
my
affair
i
like
you
very
much
ruth
but
you
really
need
not
interfere
with
me
i
should
think
not
indeed
said
miss
i
know
nothing
about
you
miss
craven
but
you
do
understand
what
a
person
of
consequence
my
niece
is
considered
in
ireland
that
may
be
replied
ruth
but
at
school
kathleen
sweet
and
dear
as
she
is
has
to
obey
the
rules
just
like
any
other
please
kathleen
do
be
persuaded
and
come
back
with
indeed
miss
if
you
will
only
believe
me
it
is
considered
a
very
grave
offence
to
miss
morning
school
or
to
be
late
when
nine
strikes
and
kathleen
ca
be
at
school
in
time
unless
she
returns
home
now
i
not
going
so
there
said
kathleen
perhaps
some
one
would
tell
me
when
the
next
train
for
merrifield
leaves
charing
cross
was
ruth
next
remark
before
any
one
could
reply
to
her
however
a
servant
entered
and
said
something
in
a
low
tone
to
miss
well
now
she
said
speaking
with
eagerness
her
face
all
smiles
and
dimples
the
way
is
made
plain
for
you
at
least
miss
who
do
you
think
has
come
kathleen
why
the
lady
who
has
charge
of
you
tennant
oh
the
dear
tired
one
cried
kathleen
she
can
never
be
cross
and
i
like
her
very
where
is
the
lady
she
added
turning
to
the
waiter
she
is
in
the
hall
miss
kathleen
flew
out
and
before
tennant
who
was
really
feeling
very
angry
could
prevent
her
had
flung
her
arms
round
her
neck
thank
goodness
it
is
you
said
the
young
girl
now
do
be
angry
for
you
do
know
how
to
manage
it
if
it
was
alice
would
she
be
in
a
tantrum
but
you
are
all
right
you
have
an
idea
of
scolding
me
i
arrived
here
as
safely
as
a
girl
could
and
what
do
you
think
i
brought
pretty
ruth
craven
with
me
she
did
much
like
it
but
here
she
is
and
she
on
to
get
home
so
she
can
return
with
you
she
you
must
come
too
kathleen
you
annoyed
me
very
much
indeed
you
gave
me
a
terrible
fright
i
did
not
know
what
might
have
happened
to
you
knowing
how
ignorant
you
are
of
london
and
its
ways
but
i
have
got
a
head
on
my
shoulders
laughed
kathleen
and
now
that
you
have
come
we
must
have
a
bit
of
fun
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
aunty
it
is
aunt
katie
you
know
the
lady
who
sent
me
the
beautiful
wonderful
clothes
but
here
miss
herself
appeared
on
the
scene
kathleen
did
the
necessary
introducing
and
the
two
ladies
moved
a
little
apart
to
talk
together
miss
called
the
two
girls
to
her
side
tennant
is
not
angry
with
you
now
kathleen
on
the
contrary
she
loves
you
very
much
and
she
will
take
miss
ruth
craven
back
with
her
i
have
been
trying
to
induce
her
to
stay
here
herself
but
she
wo
and
as
ruth
is
anxious
to
return
home
her
escort
has
come
very
opportunely
as
to
you
darling
nothing
will
induce
me
to
part
with
you
until
morning
but
what
will
you
do
about
school
said
ruth
that
can
be
managed
said
miss
it
is
the
first
time
that
kathleen
and
i
have
got
up
with
the
sunrise
we
get
up
before
it
i
thinking
and
take
a
train
and
be
in
time
to
have
a
good
breakfast
at
mrs
then
if
you
my
dear
lady
will
put
up
with
me
until
i
can
see
more
of
my
kathleen
and
propound
some
plans
for
your
pleasure
as
well
as
hers
if
you
must
go
tennant
i
am
afraid
you
must
for
the
next
train
leaves
charing
cross
for
merrifield
at
ten
minutes
past
nine
tennant
looked
grave
but
it
was
difficult
to
resist
miss
and
the
time
was
passing
accordingly
she
and
ruth
left
the
hôtel
métropole
and
the
aunt
and
niece
found
themselves
alone
chapter
xvii
miss
katie
and
her
niece
now
kathleen
said
miss
you
come
straight
up
to
my
bedroom
where
there
is
a
cosy
fire
and
where
we
will
be
just
as
snug
as
punch
we
draw
two
chairs
up
to
the
fire
and
have
a
real
collogue
that
we
will
yes
that
we
will
said
kathleen
i
have
a
lot
of
things
to
ask
you
and
a
lot
of
things
to
tell
you
come
along
then
dear
child
my
room
is
on
the
second
floor
we
wait
for
the
lift
kathleen
took
miss
katie
hand
and
they
ran
merrily
and
as
lightly
as
up
the
stairs
people
turned
to
look
at
them
as
they
sped
upwards
why
the
little
old
lady
seems
as
young
and
agile
as
the
pretty
niece
said
one
visitor
to
another
oh
they
both
irish
that
accounts
for
anything
was
the
answer
the
most
extraordinary
and
the
most
lively
nation
on
the
face
of
the
earth
the
two
vivacious
irishwomen
entered
their
bedroom
aunt
katie
flung
herself
into
a
deep
kathleen
did
likewise
and
then
they
talked
to
their
heart
content
it
is
good
to
hear
two
irishwomen
conversing
together
for
there
is
so
much
action
in
the
conversation
such
lifting
of
brows
such
raising
of
hands
such
emphasis
in
tone
in
voice
in
manner
imagery
is
so
freely
employed
telling
sentences
sharp
satire
wit
brilliant
overflowing
spontaneous
all
come
to
the
fore
laughter
sometimes
checks
the
eager
flow
of
words
occasionally
too
if
the
conversation
is
sorrowful
tears
flow
and
sobs
come
from
the
excited
and
hearts
no
one
need
be
dull
who
has
the
privilege
of
listening
to
two
irishwomen
who
have
been
parted
for
some
time
talking
their
hearts
out
to
each
other
kathleen
and
her
aunt
were
no
exception
to
the
universal
rule
kathleen
had
never
been
from
home
before
and
aunt
katie
had
things
to
tell
her
about
every
person
man
and
woman
old
and
young
on
the
carrigrohane
estate
but
when
all
the
news
had
been
told
when
the
exact
number
of
dogs
had
been
recounted
the
cats
and
kittens
described
the
fowls
the
goats
the
donkeys
the
horses
the
cows
enumerated
it
came
to
be
aunt
katie
turn
to
listen
now
my
love
tell
me
and
be
quick
about
all
you
have
been
doing
and
first
and
foremost
how
do
you
like
school
not
at
all
aunty
and
i
not
learning
anything
my
dear
that
is
sad
hearing
and
your
poor
father
pining
his
heart
out
for
the
want
of
you
i
never
wished
to
go
to
school
said
kathleen
you
will
have
to
bear
it
now
my
pet
unless
you
have
real
cause
for
complaint
they
not
unkind
to
you
acushla
are
they
oh
not
really
aunt
katie
but
they
such
dull
people
the
teachers
are
dull
i
do
mind
miss
spicer
so
much
she
the
music
teacher
as
to
miss
ravenscroft
i
have
never
even
seen
her
and
who
is
she
darling
the
and
no
end
of
a
toff
what
a
toff
dear
it
a
slang
word
they
use
in
stupid
old
england
i
do
admire
it
my
love
do
you
demean
yourself
by
bringing
words
of
that
sort
home
to
carrigrohane
not
i
sha
be
a
minute
in
the
old
place
before
the
salt
breezes
will
blow
england
out
of
my
memory
ah
it
i
who
pine
to
be
home
again
it
will
broaden
your
mind
kathleen
and
improve
you
and
some
of
the
english
people
are
very
nice
entirely
said
miss
making
this
last
statement
in
what
she
considered
a
widely
condescending
manner
so
your
are
not
learning
much
i
am
getting
on
with
my
music
perhaps
i
settle
down
to
work
i
should
not
loathe
it
so
much
if
it
was
not
for
alice
ah
she
the
daughter
of
tennant
i
rather
took
to
tennant
the
creature
she
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
face
she
as
right
as
rain
aunty
and
so
are
the
two
boys
but
alice
she
is
what
darling
a
prig
aunty
detestable
i
never
took
to
that
sort
said
miss
would
you
like
some
and
some
plumcake
to
munch
while
you
are
talking
deary
i
should
mind
i
ring
and
order
them
a
servant
appeared
miss
gave
orders
which
resulted
in
a
rich
and
most
unwholesome
supper
being
placed
upon
the
table
kathleen
and
her
aunt
ate
while
they
talked
and
what
occupies
you
love
at
all
at
all
said
miss
as
she
ate
her
second
from
your
description
it
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
death
in
life
that
town
of
merrifield
i
have
to
make
my
own
diversions
aunty
and
they
are
sprightly
and
entertaining
enough
do
you
remember
when
i
told
you
to
have
all
those
little
hearts
made
for
me
to
be
sure
dear
the
most
extraordinary
idea
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
only
that
i
never
cross
you
kathleen
i
have
written
to
know
the
meaning
of
it
it
does
matter
about
you
knowing
here
kathleen
briefly
and
in
graphic
language
described
the
society
of
the
wild
irish
girls
it
is
the
one
thing
that
keeps
me
alive
she
said
however
guessing
they
are
going
to
make
a
fuss
about
it
in
the
school
and
what
will
you
do
then
core
of
my
heart
stick
to
them
of
course
aunty
you
do
suppose
i
begin
a
thing
and
then
drop
it
no
that
would
be
at
all
like
you
you
young
kathleen
laughed
i
am
all
in
a
puzzle
she
said
to
know
where
to
hold
the
next
meeting
for
there
is
no
doubt
that
some
of
the
girls
who
hate
us
because
they
were
asked
to
join
spied
last
time
so
i
want
the
society
to
meet
the
night
after
next
in
a
new
place
and
i
tell
you
what
i
been
thinking
said
aunt
katie
that
be
present
and
bring
a
sparkle
of
old
ireland
to
help
the
whole
affair
so
you
have
to
reckon
with
me
on
the
occasion
of
the
next
meeting
kathleen
sat
very
still
her
face
thoughtful
nothing
will
induce
me
to
give
them
up
she
said
or
to
betray
any
girl
of
my
society
oh
aunty
there
such
a
funny
old
woman
i
met
her
last
sunday
she
a
certain
church
and
she
lives
in
a
cottage
about
four
miles
from
merrifield
we
could
have
our
meetings
there
i
know
we
could
and
she
never
tell
nobody
would
guess
she
is
the
of
one
of
the
members
of
the
society
susy
hopkins
a
nice
little
girl
a
tradesman
daughter
oh
dear
me
kathleen
you
do
mean
to
say
you
demean
yourself
by
associating
with
tradesmen
daughters
i
do
so
aunty
and
i
find
them
very
much
nicer
than
the
girls
who
think
no
end
of
themselves
well
well
said
miss
whatever
you
are
you
are
a
lady
born
and
bred
and
nothing
can
lower
that
sort
nothing
nor
nobody
you
must
make
your
own
plans
and
let
me
know
i
am
sure
i
can
manage
the
old
lady
and
i
will
tell
you
why
she
wants
to
join
our
what
you
know
what
a
snug
time
our
dear
old
have
i
was
telling
church
about
it
last
sunday
she
took
a
keen
desire
to
belong
to
us
and
i
sort
of
half
in
a
kind
of
a
way
promised
her
is
there
likely
to
be
a
vacancy
soon
aunt
katie
well
dear
there
is
a
vacancy
at
the
present
moment
hagan
breathed
her
last
poor
soul
and
was
waked
not
a
fortnight
ago
better
wire
to
your
father
to
keep
the
little
cottage
vacant
until
we
know
more
this
is
going
to
be
interesting
and
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
lark
that
i
the
one
to
help
you
my
colleen
bawn
kathleen
and
her
aunt
talked
until
late
into
the
night
and
when
the
young
girl
laid
her
head
on
her
pillow
she
was
lost
immediately
in
profound
slumber
it
was
not
at
all
difficult
for
kathleen
to
wake
early
and
accompanied
by
miss
she
arrived
at
merrifield
at
eight
on
the
following
morning
she
had
no
time
however
to
change
her
dress
but
after
washing
her
hands
and
smoothing
out
her
tangled
hair
and
leaving
miss
in
the
care
of
tennant
who
to
tell
the
truth
found
her
considerably
in
the
way
kathleen
accompanied
by
alice
started
for
school
you
catch
it
said
alice
oh
that
very
likely
darling
said
kathleen
but
i
do
think
i
much
care
did
you
see
miss
ravenscroft
last
night
and
was
she
very
very
angry
i
saw
her
and
she
was
more
than
angry
she
was
astonished
i
think
you
will
have
to
put
up
with
a
rather
serious
conversation
with
her
this
morning
she
asked
me
questions
with
regard
to
you
and
your
doings
which
of
course
i
could
not
answer
but
you
will
have
to
answer
them
i
do
think
particularly
well
of
you
kathleen
your
ways
are
not
my
ways
nor
your
ideas
mine
but
i
do
think
bad
as
you
are
that
you
would
tell
a
lie
you
will
have
to
speak
out
the
truth
to
miss
ravenscroft
kathleen
and
no
mistake
about
it
thank
you
replied
kathleen
i
think
i
can
manage
my
own
affairs
she
added
and
then
she
was
silent
not
exactly
cross
but
lost
in
thought
the
girls
reached
the
school
without
any
further
adventure
prayers
were
held
as
usual
in
the
great
hall
and
then
the
members
of
the
different
classes
went
to
their
places
and
the
work
of
the
morning
began
the
work
went
on
and
to
look
at
those
girls
all
steadfast
and
attentive
and
it
was
difficult
to
realize
that
in
some
of
their
hearts
was
wild
rebellion
and
a
naughty
and
sense
of
mischief
certainly
it
was
difficult
to
realize
that
one
at
least
of
that
number
was
determined
to
have
her
own
way
at
any
cost
that
another
was
extremely
anxious
resolved
to
tell
the
truth
and
hoping
against
hope
that
she
would
not
be
questioned
school
had
very
nearly
come
to
an
end
when
the
dread
summons
which
both
ruth
craven
and
alice
tennant
expected
arrived
for
kathleen
she
was
to
go
to
speak
to
miss
ravenscroft
in
that
lady
parlor
miss
ravenscroft
is
waiting
said
the
mistress
who
brought
kathleen
the
message
will
you
be
quick
kathleen
as
she
is
rather
in
a
hurry
kathleen
got
up
with
apparent
alacrity
her
face
looked
sunshiny
and
genial
as
she
passed
ruth
she
put
her
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
said
in
her
most
pleasant
voice
extraordinary
thing
miss
ravenscroft
has
sent
for
me
i
wonder
what
for
ruth
colored
and
looked
down
one
or
two
of
the
girls
glanced
round
at
kathleen
in
amazement
she
did
not
say
anything
further
but
left
the
room
when
she
got
into
the
passage
she
hummed
a
little
air
the
teacher
who
had
summoned
her
had
gone
on
in
front
kathleen
followed
her
at
a
respectful
distance
and
still
humming
the
wearing
of
the
green
she
knocked
at
miss
ravenscroft
door
miss
ravenscroft
was
standing
by
her
window
she
turned
when
kathleen
appeared
and
desired
her
to
sit
down
kathleen
dropped
into
a
chair
miss
ravenscroft
did
likewise
then
miss
ravenscroft
spoke
gently
for
in
spite
of
herself
kathleen
attractive
face
the
wilful
daring
and
yet
affectionate
glance
in
the
eyes
attracted
her
she
had
not
yet
had
a
full
and
perfect
view
of
kathleen
she
had
seen
it
is
true
the
pretty
little
girl
in
a
crowd
of
others
but
now
she
saw
kathleen
by
herself
the
face
was
undoubtedly
sweet
sweet
with
a
radiance
which
surprised
and
partly
fascinated
miss
ravenscroft
your
name
she
said
kathleen
replied
kathleen
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
dropped
a
little
bobbing
curtsy
then
waited
to
be
asked
to
sit
down
again
miss
ravenscroft
did
not
invite
her
to
reseat
herself
she
spoke
quietly
turning
her
eyes
away
from
the
attractive
little
face
and
handsome
figure
i
sent
for
you
last
night
and
you
did
not
obey
my
command
why
so
i
did
not
mean
to
be
rude
said
kathleen
you
see
it
was
this
way
my
aunt
from
ireland
miss
is
her
name
miss
katie
was
staying
at
the
métropole
i
had
a
telegram
from
her
desiring
me
to
go
to
her
immediately
in
town
i
got
your
note
after
i
had
read
the
telegram
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
ought
to
go
first
to
my
aunt
she
is
my
own
sister
and
such
a
darling
you
could
but
love
her
if
you
saw
her
you
might
think
me
a
little
rude
not
to
come
to
you
when
you
sent
for
me
but
aunt
katie
would
have
been
hurt
terribly
fearfully
hurt
she
might
even
have
cried
kathleen
raised
her
brows
as
she
said
the
last
word
her
face
expressed
consternation
and
a
trifle
of
amazement
miss
ravenscroft
felt
as
though
smiles
were
very
near
even
suppose
your
aunt
had
cried
she
said
your
duty
was
to
me
as
your
please
said
kathleen
i
did
not
think
it
was
i
thought
my
duty
was
to
my
aunt
miss
ravenscroft
was
silent
for
a
minute
my
dear
she
said
then
gently
you
are
new
to
the
school
you
have
doubtless
indulged
in
a
very
and
unconventional
life
in
your
own
country
i
was
once
in
ireland
in
the
west
and
i
liked
the
people
and
the
land
and
the
ways
of
the
people
and
the
looks
of
the
land
and
for
the
sake
of
that
visit
i
am
not
going
to
be
hard
on
a
little
irish
girl
during
her
first
sojourn
in
the
school
in
future
kathleen
i
must
insist
on
instant
obedience
i
will
forgive
you
for
your
disregard
of
my
message
last
night
but
if
ever
i
require
you
again
i
shall
expect
you
to
come
to
me
at
once
for
the
present
we
will
forget
last
night
thank
you
madam
i
am
sure
i
should
love
you
very
much
if
i
knew
you
well
that
is
not
the
question
my
dear
i
must
insist
on
your
treating
me
with
respect
it
is
not
very
easy
to
know
the
the
girls
know
her
up
to
a
certain
point
but
personal
friendship
as
between
one
woman
and
another
can
not
quite
exist
between
a
little
girl
and
her
yes
my
dear
i
hope
you
will
love
me
but
in
the
sense
of
one
who
is
set
in
authority
over
you
that
is
my
position
and
i
hope
as
long
as
i
live
to
do
my
duty
now
then
kathleen
i
will
speak
to
you
about
the
other
matter
which
obliged
me
to
send
you
a
message
last
night
thank
you
said
kathleen
she
looked
down
so
that
the
fun
in
her
eyes
could
not
be
seen
i
am
sure
from
your
face
that
you
will
not
tell
me
a
lie
no
said
kathleen
i
wo
tell
you
a
lie
i
must
however
ask
you
one
or
two
direct
questions
is
it
true
that
you
have
encouraged
certain
girls
in
this
school
oh
i
encourage
all
the
girls
i
know
poor
things
i
do
interrupt
me
kathleen
i
have
more
to
say
is
it
true
that
you
encourage
certain
girls
in
this
school
here
miss
ravenscroft
put
up
her
hand
to
check
kathleen
words
to
rebellion
and
insubordination
i
do
know
what
insubordination
is
said
kathleen
shaking
her
head
is
it
true
continued
the
that
you
have
started
a
society
which
is
called
by
some
ridiculous
name
such
as
the
wild
irish
girls
and
that
you
meet
each
week
in
a
quarry
a
short
distance
from
town
that
you
have
got
rules
and
badges
that
you
sing
naughty
songs
and
altogether
misbehave
yourselves
is
it
true
kathleen
closed
her
lips
firmly
together
miss
ravenscroft
looked
full
at
her
kathleen
then
spoke
slowly
how
did
you
hear
that
we
do
what
you
say
we
do
i
do
not
intend
to
name
my
informant
the
girls
who
have
joined
your
society
and
are
putting
themselves
under
your
influence
are
the
sort
of
girls
who
in
a
school
like
this
get
most
injured
by
such
proceedings
they
have
never
been
accustomed
to
they
have
not
been
guided
to
control
themselves
of
all
the
girls
in
the
school
whom
you
miss
have
tried
to
injure
you
have
selected
the
foundationers
who
have
only
been
to
board
schools
before
they
came
here
they
look
up
to
you
as
above
them
by
birth
your
very
way
your
words
can
influence
them
wrong
from
your
lips
will
appear
right
and
right
will
appear
wrong
you
yourself
are
an
ignorant
and
unlearned
child
and
yet
you
attempt
to
guide
others
this
society
must
be
broken
up
immediately
i
will
forgive
you
for
the
past
if
you
promise
me
that
you
will
never
hold
another
meeting
that
as
long
as
you
are
at
the
school
you
will
not
encourage
another
girl
to
join
this
society
you
will
have
to
give
me
your
word
and
that
before
you
leave
this
room
i
do
not
require
you
to
betray
your
companions
i
do
not
even
ask
their
names
i
but
demand
your
promise
which
i
insist
on
the
irish
girls
or
the
wild
irish
girls
whatever
you
like
to
call
them
must
cease
to
exist
miss
ravenscroft
ceased
speaking
is
that
all
said
kathleen
what
do
you
mean
i
want
your
promise
but
i
have
nothing
to
say
you
are
not
stupid
kathleen
i
can
see
that
and
i
should
hope
you
were
too
much
of
a
lady
to
be
impertinent
what
do
you
mean
to
do
indeed
said
kathleen
i
do
mean
to
be
impertinent
and
i
want
to
tell
a
lie
the
best
way
on
the
present
occasion
is
to
be
silent
i
ca
give
myself
or
the
other
girls
in
the
school
away
you
ask
me
to
make
you
a
promise
i
can
not
make
that
promise
i
am
sorry
perhaps
i
had
better
leave
the
school
no
kathleen
you
can
not
leave
it
in
the
ordinary
way
you
are
connected
with
other
girls
now
your
influence
must
be
publicly
withdrawn
i
had
hoped
to
spare
you
this
but
if
you
defy
me
you
know
the
consequences
may
i
go
now
said
kathleen
you
may
for
the
present
i
must
consult
with
the
other
teachers
it
may
even
be
necessary
to
call
a
meeting
of
the
board
of
governors
your
conduct
requires
stringent
measures
but
my
child
and
here
miss
ravenscroft
changed
her
voice
to
one
of
gentleness
and
entreaty
you
will
not
be
so
silly
so
wicked
so
perverse
kathleen
it
is
sometimes
a
hard
thing
to
give
up
your
own
way
but
i
think
an
irish
girl
can
be
noble
you
will
be
very
noble
now
if
you
cease
to
belong
to
the
irish
girls
society
irish
girls
is
the
name
said
kathleen
you
must
give
it
up
it
was
a
mad
and
silly
scheme
you
must
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
it
kathleen
slightly
shook
her
head
miss
ravenscroft
uttered
a
deep
sigh
i
am
afraid
i
must
go
said
kathleen
i
think
you
have
spoken
to
me
very
kindly
i
should
like
to
have
been
able
to
oblige
you
and
you
wo
kathleen
shook
her
head
again
the
next
moment
she
had
left
the
room
the
school
was
nearly
over
but
whether
it
had
been
or
not
kathleen
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
returning
to
her
she
stood
for
a
moment
in
one
of
the
corridors
to
collect
her
thoughts
then
going
to
the
room
where
the
hats
and
jackets
hung
on
pegs
she
took
down
her
own
put
them
on
and
left
the
school
she
walked
fast
and
reached
tennant
house
at
a
quarter
to
one
both
tennant
and
miss
were
out
there
was
a
message
for
kathleen
to
say
that
miss
expected
her
to
be
ready
to
go
to
town
with
her
immediately
after
dinner
kathleen
smiled
to
herself
dear
aunt
katie
she
must
get
me
out
of
this
scrape
but
as
to
thinking
of
giving
up
girls
whom
i
meant
to
help
and
will
help
i
would
do
it
for
twenty
miss
ravenscrofts
she
stood
at
the
door
of
the
house
then
a
sudden
idea
struck
her
and
as
she
saw
the
girls
filing
out
of
the
school
she
crossed
the
common
and
met
susy
hopkins
her
satchel
of
books
flung
across
her
shoulder
ah
susy
here
i
am
i
want
to
speak
to
you
susy
ran
up
to
her
in
excitement
it
was
already
whispered
in
the
school
that
their
secret
proceedings
were
becoming
known
it
had
also
been
whispered
from
one
to
another
that
kathleen
had
undergone
a
formidable
interview
with
miss
ravenscroft
that
very
morning
what
is
it
kathleen
said
susy
was
she
very
very
cross
who
do
you
mean
asked
kathleen
instantly
on
the
defensive
miss
ravenscroft
you
went
to
see
her
every
one
knows
it
what
did
she
say
that
is
my
affair
but
susy
i
want
you
to
do
something
we
must
not
go
to
the
quarry
evening
we
want
to
have
the
meeting
at
your
aunt
i
want
to
go
to
church
you
must
run
round
this
afternoon
and
make
arrangements
there
be
about
thirty
or
forty
of
us
and
we
must
all
be
smuggled
into
the
cottage
oh
dear
said
susy
but
how
are
we
to
get
there
it
four
miles
away
well
i
suppose
those
who
are
really
interested
can
walk
four
miles
i
certainly
can
susy
you
had
better
not
miss
it
night
for
aunt
katie
is
to
be
present
and
there
no
saying
what
she
will
do
she
will
help
us
if
any
one
can
she
is
ever
so
kind
and
so
interested
it
will
be
the
greatest
meeting
the
society
has
ever
had
i
would
miss
it
myself
for
the
world
oh
hurrah
said
susy
you
certainly
are
a
splendid
girl
kathleen
and
wo
aunt
church
be
pleased
tell
her
that
if
she
wants
to
get
one
of
the
little
almshouses
she
had
better
oblige
us
as
far
as
she
can
said
kathleen
now
i
must
rush
back
to
dinner
i
am
going
to
town
afterwards
without
waiting
for
susy
reply
kathleen
turned
on
her
heel
and
returned
home
susy
watched
her
for
a
minute
then
slowly
and
gravely
went
in
the
direction
of
her
mother
shop
hopkins
was
getting
in
fresh
stock
that
morning
and
the
little
shop
looked
brighter
and
fresher
than
it
had
done
for
some
time
it
was
a
beautiful
day
in
the
beginning
of
winter
with
that
feeling
of
summer
in
the
air
which
comes
to
cheer
us
now
and
then
in
november
susy
marched
through
the
shop
still
swinging
her
satchel
i
wish
you
would
do
that
susy
said
her
mother
and
i
wish
too
that
you
would
always
be
late
home
be
quick
now
and
pork
for
dinner
tom
is
in
a
hurry
to
be
off
to
his
football
oh
bother
said
susy
hopkins
frowned
susy
in
her
mother
opinion
was
not
quite
so
nice
and
comforting
as
she
once
had
been
but
it
was
not
way
to
reproach
her
children
she
bore
her
burden
with
regard
to
them
as
silently
and
patiently
as
she
could
susy
ran
up
to
her
room
tossed
off
her
hat
washed
her
hands
and
came
down
soon
the
three
were
seated
at
their
frugal
dinner
you
seem
to
have
got
in
a
lot
of
fresh
goods
mother
said
tom
i
have
said
hopkins
with
a
groan
but
i
have
paid
for
one
of
them
parkins
says
he
will
trust
me
for
quite
a
month
but
however
i
am
to
pay
your
aunt
church
and
keep
enough
money
for
the
new
goods
beats
me
sometimes
i
think
that
my
burden
is
greater
than
i
can
bear
i
have
often
had
a
feeling
that
i
ought
to
give
up
the
shop
and
take
service
somewhere
i
used
to
be
noted
as
the
best
of
good
housekeepers
when
i
was
young
oh
no
mother
you
must
do
that
said
susy
what
would
tom
and
i
do
if
it
was
for
you
and
tom
i
give
notice
said
the
widow
but
there
we
must
hope
for
the
best
i
suppose
god
never
forsakes
those
who
trust
him
mother
said
susy
suddenly
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
spare
me
this
afternoon
i
want
to
go
and
see
aunt
church
why
should
you
do
that
child
there
no
way
for
you
to
go
except
on
your
legs
and
it
a
weary
walk
and
the
days
are
getting
short
all
the
same
i
must
go
said
susy
i
suppose
you
could
shut
up
the
shop
and
come
with
me
could
you
mother
shut
up
the
shop
said
hopkins
what
next
will
the
child
ask
not
a
bit
of
it
susan
but
what
do
you
want
to
see
your
aunt
for
it
is
a
little
private
message
in
connection
with
miss
kathleen
it
means
money
mother
of
that
i
am
certain
it
means
that
aunt
church
will
forgive
you
last
month
installment
of
the
debt
and
perhaps
next
month
too
you
had
best
let
me
go
mother
i
am
not
talking
without
knowledge
and
i
ca
tell
you
what
i
know
i
know
something
said
tom
and
he
gave
utterance
to
a
low
whistle
susy
turned
and
glanced
at
her
brother
in
some
uneasiness
there
are
a
deal
of
funny
things
whispered
about
your
school
just
now
he
said
i
not
going
to
peach
of
course
only
you
best
look
out
they
say
if
it
got
to
the
governors
ears
every
foundationer
in
the
place
would
be
expelled
it
is
something
that
ought
not
to
be
done
do
mind
him
mother
do
you
think
i
do
anything
to
endanger
my
continuing
at
the
school
after
all
the
trouble
and
care
and
anxiety
you
had
in
getting
me
placed
there
really
child
said
hopkins
i
do
know
the
wilfullness
of
young
folks
in
these
days
is
past
enduring
but
you
had
better
clearly
understand
susy
that
if
for
any
reason
you
are
dismissed
from
the
school
there
is
nothing
whatever
for
you
but
to
take
a
place
as
a
servant
and
that
you
would
like
i
should
think
not
indeed
well
mother
to
avoid
all
these
consequences
i
must
go
as
fast
as
i
can
to
see
aunt
church
chapter
xviii
susy
hopkins
persuades
aunt
church
hopkins
said
nothing
more
susy
saw
that
she
could
have
her
own
way
and
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
without
even
waiting
to
help
her
mother
to
put
the
place
in
order
she
started
on
her
walk
she
felt
pleased
and
the
day
was
a
frosty
one
and
the
sunset
promised
to
be
glorious
the
road
to
church
house
was
flat
and
long
and
pleasant
to
walk
on
susy
had
no
particular
eye
for
pretty
views
or
she
might
have
pleased
herself
with
the
wonderful
tints
of
the
sky
and
the
autumnal
shades
which
had
not
altogether
deserted
the
neighboring
woods
susy
thoughts
however
were
occupied
with
very
different
matters
mother
is
always
grumbling
she
said
to
herself
and
for
that
matter
so
is
tom
as
if
i
demean
myself
by
taking
a
place
the
idea
of
my
being
a
servant
why
i
know
i
shall
do
very
well
in
the
future
i
look
high
i
mean
to
be
a
lady
as
good
as
the
best
would
miss
kathleen
take
so
much
notice
of
me
if
i
was
not
a
very
nice
sort
of
a
girl
i
am
sure
no
one
could
look
sweeter
than
i
do
in
my
blouse
even
tom
says
so
he
said
i
looked
very
genteel
and
that
like
his
great
friend
walter
amber
to
see
me
i
do
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
tom
friends
poor
tom
if
mother
can
apprentice
him
to
somebody
that
is
the
most
that
can
be
expected
but
as
for
me
the
very
lowest
position
i
intend
to
take
in
life
in
the
future
is
that
of
a
teacher
i
shall
probably
be
a
teacher
in
this
very
school
and
get
my
couple
of
hundred
a
year
a
place
indeed
poor
dear
mother
know
what
she
is
talking
about
occupied
with
her
own
thoughts
the
road
did
not
turn
out
long
to
susy
she
reached
church
very
humble
abode
between
three
and
four
it
was
still
daylight
the
little
old
lady
was
seated
in
her
window
she
looked
very
much
surprised
when
she
saw
susy
and
limped
to
the
door
and
opened
it
come
in
susy
hopkins
she
said
i
suppose
your
mother
has
sent
me
my
money
if
so
it
is
very
thoughtful
of
her
if
you
have
brought
the
money
susy
you
shall
have
a
cup
of
tea
before
you
start
on
your
homeward
walk
it
is
a
fine
day
child
and
your
cheeks
look
very
fresh
come
in
dear
come
in
church
hobbled
back
again
into
her
small
she
got
back
into
her
chair
and
motioned
to
susy
to
take
one
opposite
to
her
if
that
is
the
money
you
have
in
your
hand
she
said
noticing
that
the
child
held
a
small
parcel
you
may
give
it
to
me
and
then
go
over
there
and
get
me
that
black
i
will
put
the
gold
and
silver
in
immediately
it
is
never
safe
to
leave
money
about
but
i
have
got
the
money
aunt
church
mother
could
have
saved
it
in
the
time
church
face
became
very
bleak
and
decidedly
wintry
in
appearance
then
what
have
you
come
for
susan
she
said
you
need
suppose
i
am
going
to
waste
my
good
tea
on
you
if
you
have
brought
the
money
if
you
think
so
you
are
fine
and
mistaken
i
do
think
so
really
aunt
church
but
perhaps
when
you
know
all
you
will
give
me
a
cup
of
tea
and
perhaps
you
wo
be
so
cross
the
next
time
i
wear
my
blouse
ah
my
dear
i
was
cross
at
the
end
of
the
time
although
i
did
think
it
a
bit
suspicious
your
mother
losing
of
my
own
money
out
of
her
till
you
forget
that
fact
susan
hopkins
it
was
my
money
and
then
you
decking
yourself
out
in
the
most
unsuitable
garment
i
ever
saw
on
a
little
girl
of
your
age
and
station
it
has
pleased
the
almighty
susan
to
put
you
in
a
low
walk
of
life
and
in
that
walk
you
ought
to
remain
and
dress
according
yes
dress
according
but
as
i
said
i
was
not
displeased
at
the
end
that
was
a
very
bonny
young
lady
who
came
into
your
mother
shop
miles
and
miles
above
you
susan
and
how
she
can
demean
herself
to
call
you
her
friend
passes
my
comprehension
you
are
very
rude
aunt
church
said
susy
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
angry
with
you
for
i
want
you
to
help
us
i
have
got
news
for
you
and
very
good
news
too
but
i
will
only
tell
it
to
you
on
condition
church
looked
first
skeptical
then
curious
then
keenly
desirous
well
child
she
said
maybe
you
might
as
well
put
the
kettle
on
the
fire
it
takes
a
good
long
time
to
boil
it
a
very
bobbish
little
kettle
and
it
has
cranky
whims
just
as
though
it
were
a
human
a
good
child
susan
take
it
out
and
fill
it
at
the
tap
and
put
it
on
the
fire
to
boil
up
while
you
are
telling
me
the
rest
of
the
story
i
always
liked
you
very
well
susan
not
so
much
as
tom
but
you
are
quite
to
my
liking
all
things
considered
no
you
never
liked
me
aunt
church
said
susy
but
i
will
fill
the
kettle
if
you
have
a
fancy
although
perhaps
i
wo
be
able
to
stay
to
have
that
cup
of
tea
that
you
seem
all
of
a
sudden
willing
to
give
me
church
said
nothing
susy
left
the
room
with
the
kettle
i
could
fly
out
at
her
thought
the
old
lady
but
where
the
good
she
hand
and
glove
with
that
beautiful
miss
and
for
the
sake
of
the
young
lady
i
must
get
her
back
up
too
much
so
susy
put
the
kettle
on
to
boil
and
then
resumed
her
place
opposite
church
susan
said
the
old
lady
while
the
kettle
is
boiling
you
might
as
well
lay
the
cloth
and
get
out
the
no
no
said
susy
i
have
come
here
to
act
servant
to
you
aunt
church
you
have
a
very
nasty
manner
susan
and
whatever
the
almighty
may
mean
to
do
with
you
in
the
future
you
had
best
change
your
tune
or
things
will
go
ill
with
you
susy
sat
quite
still
apparently
indifferent
to
these
remarks
well
if
you
wo
lay
the
cloth
and
wo
help
your
own
poor
old
aunt
you
may
as
well
tell
me
what
you
came
for
not
yet
i
will
presently
susy
was
now
thoroughly
enjoying
herself
church
edged
her
chair
a
little
nearer
her
beady
black
eyes
seemed
to
read
susy
through
and
through
go
on
child
speak
right
to
keep
an
old
body
on
i
will
tell
you
if
you
will
promise
me
something
i
have
brought
you
a
little
bag
that
i
made
my
own
self
and
you
shall
have
it
if
you
promise
me
something
it
is
a
bag
for
your
knitting
you
know
you
said
that
you
were
always
losing
the
ball
it
would
keep
running
under
your
chair
and
you
could
never
get
it
without
stooping
and
hurting
yourself
to
be
sure
i
did
child
and
it
is
thoughtful
of
you
to
think
of
me
well
but
we
talk
of
the
bag
when
you
have
said
whatever
else
you
have
got
at
the
back
of
that
wise
little
head
of
yours
i
have
got
news
that
may
mean
a
great
deal
to
you
but
before
i
tell
it
i
want
you
to
give
me
a
promise
i
want
you
to
let
mother
off
this
month
installment
of
her
debt
what
cried
church
turning
very
pale
the
money
that
she
owes
me
yes
the
money
she
owes
you
a
thief
came
into
the
shop
and
took
some
of
her
money
and
she
is
very
short
of
money
and
very
worried
i
will
tell
you
the
news
if
you
will
forgive
mother
well
said
church
of
all
the
impertinent
wicked
little
girls
you
beat
them
all
my
answer
to
that
susan
hopkins
is
no
and
you
can
leave
the
house
for
that
is
the
last
word
you
will
get
thank
you
aunt
church
said
susy
i
will
leave
it
it
does
matter
whether
you
hear
the
message
i
have
come
to
give
you
or
not
it
is
from
miss
kathleen
but
that
do
matter
either
what
have
you
to
do
with
a
young
lady
like
miss
kathleen
she
as
unsuitable
to
be
with
you
as
she
is
to
be
with
me
aunt
church
susy
got
as
far
as
the
door
when
church
called
her
back
come
here
you
bad
little
thing
she
said
sit
down
on
that
chair
now
what
do
you
mean
i
say
i
will
give
you
my
message
if
you
will
forgive
mother
then
i
wo
i
will
never
hear
your
message
all
right
i
will
go
said
susy
i
tell
miss
kathleen
she
will
be
disappointed
so
to
speak
it
was
about
those
almshouses
but
look
here
child
you
tell
me
first
and
then
i
consider
no
no
said
susy
i
know
something
better
than
that
you
make
the
promise
first
faithfully
and
truly
and
then
i
will
tell
you
after
this
there
was
a
considerable
wrangle
between
the
old
woman
and
the
young
girl
but
all
in
good
time
susy
won
her
desire
and
church
made
the
required
promise
now
speak
she
said
there
that
kettle
singing
like
mad
and
it
will
boil
over
in
a
minute
you
shall
have
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
nice
sweet
bun
with
it
and
what
more
can
a
poor
old
body
like
myself
offer
what
about
miss
kathleen
aunt
church
you
can
help
miss
kathleen
and
she
is
worthy
of
being
helped
she
wants
you
to
do
something
for
her
me
said
church
and
what
can
a
poor
body
like
me
do
to
help
her
things
ought
to
be
the
other
way
round
it
she
who
ought
to
help
me
and
so
she
will
and
she
said
as
much
she
said
she
do
what
she
could
to
put
you
into
one
of
those
sweet
little
almshouses
and
when
miss
kathleen
says
a
thing
she
means
it
and
there
an
aunt
of
hers
has
come
over
from
ireland
and
from
all
accounts
she
must
be
a
perfect
wonder
and
she
coming
too
oh
aunt
church
you
are
in
luck
you
are
enough
to
distract
any
one
child
susy
i
told
you
the
kettle
would
boil
before
we
were
ready
for
tea
take
it
off
and
put
it
on
the
hob
and
be
careful
for
goodness
sake
susy
hopkins
or
you
scald
yourself
susy
removed
the
kettle
from
its
position
on
the
glowing
bed
of
coals
and
then
resumed
her
narrative
they
all
coming
she
said
and
you
will
have
to
get
them
in
by
hook
or
crook
you
enough
to
deave
a
body
who
coming
and
where
are
they
coming
when
they
do
come
they
coming
here
aunt
church
a
lot
of
them
girls
like
me
big
girls
and
little
girls
old
girls
and
young
girls
bad
girls
and
good
girls
girls
who
laugh
at
you
and
girls
who
respect
you
some
dressed
badly
and
some
dressed
fine
they
are
all
coming
up
to
forty
of
them
in
number
and
miss
kathleen
is
the
queen
amongst
them
miss
katie
is
coming
too
and
it
to
your
house
they
to
come
and
it
to
happen
night
really
susy
of
all
the
impertinent
children
i
do
think
you
beat
all
forty
people
coming
into
this
tiny
house
where
we
can
scarcely
turn
round
with
more
than
two
in
the
house
you
are
talking
pure
nonsense
susan
hopkins
and
i
break
my
word
if
that
all
you
have
to
tell
it
true
enough
have
you
never
heard
of
our
society
well
of
course
not
so
i
will
tell
you
it
is
this
way
aunt
church
when
miss
kathleen
came
to
the
school
she
took
pity
on
us
foundationers
she
founded
a
society
and
we
used
to
meet
in
the
old
quarry
just
to
the
left
of
johnson
field
and
right
good
times
we
had
she
promised
us
all
sorts
of
things
it
was
she
who
gave
me
that
blouse
that
you
seemed
to
think
i
had
bought
with
the
money
which
was
taken
from
mother
till
and
she
gave
me
this
see
aunt
church
if
you
look
you
will
believe
here
susy
pulled
from
the
neck
of
her
dress
a
little
locket
with
the
device
and
name
of
the
society
on
it
look
for
yourself
she
said
church
did
look
she
put
on
her
spectacles
and
read
the
words
the
wild
irish
girls
october
whatever
does
this
mean
she
said
the
wild
irish
girls
it
sound
at
all
a
respectable
sort
of
name
i
am
one
said
susy
beginning
to
skip
up
and
down
i
am
a
wild
irish
girl
that
you
ai
you
do
know
the
meaning
of
the
thing
you
are
nothing
but
a
little
cockney
thank
you
aunt
church
i
do
feel
obliged
for
your
kind
opinion
of
me
but
now
are
you
going
to
help
miss
kathleen
or
are
you
not
she
have
the
girls
the
wild
irish
girls
i
mean
any
longer
at
the
quarry
for
it
getting
noised
abroad
in
the
school
and
there
are
those
think
very
little
of
telling
on
us
and
then
we
might
all
be
expelled
for
it
contrary
to
the
rules
of
the
governors
that
there
should
be
anything
underhand
or
anything
of
that
sort
in
the
place
so
it
is
this
way
we
have
got
into
trouble
we
wild
irish
girls
and
dear
miss
kathleen
is
determined
that
come
what
will
the
society
must
not
suffer
and
she
thinks
you
could
help
and
if
you
help
in
any
sort
of
fashion
why
she
take
precious
good
care
that
you
get
into
one
of
those
little
almshouses
she
said
i
was
to
see
you
and
i
was
to
take
her
back
the
answer
and
now
will
you
help
or
will
you
not
well
i
never
said
church
when
she
had
uttered
these
words
she
sank
back
in
her
chair
her
knitting
was
forgotten
her
old
face
looked
pale
with
anxiety
have
a
cup
of
tea
it
will
help
you
to
think
more
than
anything
said
susy
and
in
a
brisk
and
businesslike
fashion
she
dived
into
the
cupboard
took
out
the
cups
and
saucers
a
little
box
of
biscuits
a
tiny
jug
of
milk
a
caddy
of
tea
and
proceeded
to
fill
the
little
teapot
tea
was
ready
and
susy
brought
a
cup
to
the
old
lady
there
now
she
said
you
see
what
it
means
to
have
a
nice
little
girl
like
me
to
wait
on
you
you
have
taken
an
hour
hobbling
round
all
by
yourself
now
what
will
you
do
what
shall
i
do
said
church
look
round
susan
hopkins
and
ask
me
what
i
am
to
do
how
many
of
those
forty
can
be
squeezed
into
this
room
let
me
think
said
susy
she
looked
round
the
room
which
was
really
not
more
than
twelve
feet
square
we
could
get
many
in
here
she
said
four
might
stand
against
the
wall
there
and
four
there
and
so
on
but
that
would
go
far
when
there
are
forty
we
must
have
the
backyard
what
and
upset
the
pig
said
church
oh
aunt
church
you
really
ca
think
of
brownie
at
a
moment
like
this
they
must
all
congregate
in
the
yard
and
you
shall
look
on
oh
you
enjoy
it
fine
but
you
ought
to
have
tea
for
miss
and
miss
katie
you
really
ought
think
aunt
church
it
is
quite
worth
while
when
you
have
an
almshouse
in
view
and
you
know
that
for
all
the
rest
of
your
life
you
are
to
have
a
house
coal
and
light
and
six
shillings
a
week
it
worth
an
effort
said
church
it
is
that
but
i
doubt
me
now
that
the
thing
seems
so
near
whether
i
shall
like
the
crossing
i
ca
abide
finding
myself
on
the
salty
sea
i
have
that
to
think
over
and
that
is
against
the
scheme
susy
hopkins
and
what
do
a
few
hours
misery
signify
said
susy
when
you
have
all
the
rest
of
your
life
to
live
in
clover
that
true
that
true
said
the
old
lady
if
you
are
positive
that
it
wo
upset
brownie
you
can
lock
brownie
up
i
will
take
charge
of
the
key
and
have
him
grunting
like
anything
he
wo
be
heard
with
forty
of
them
it
does
sound
very
insurrectionary
and
wrong
said
church
but
if
you
are
certain
sure
she
will
keep
her
word
if
i
am
sure
of
anybody
it
is
miss
kathleen
she
looks
a
good
sort
and
then
you
know
aunty
church
you
can
clinch
matters
by
having
a
nice
little
tea
for
her
and
afterwards
if
you
do
speak
up
i
will
i
tell
her
you
expect
to
get
the
almshouse
after
doing
so
much
as
to
entertain
forty
of
her
guests
well
look
here
susy
you
have
thrust
yourself
into
this
matter
and
you
must
help
me
out
i
suppose
i
must
have
a
tea
but
it
must
be
a
very
plain
one
no
it
must
be
a
very
nice
tea
oh
i
see
to
that
mother
shall
send
over
some
things
from
town
a
little
pink
ham
cut
very
thin
and
eggs
and
said
church
i
have
a
real
relish
for
and
it
a
very
long
time
since
i
had
any
you
have
got
your
own
fowls
said
susy
so
they
will
supply
the
eggs
and
for
the
rest
i
will
manage
you
are
very
good
indeed
aunty
and
mother
will
be
so
pleased
kiss
me
aunt
church
i
must
be
off
or
be
getting
into
a
terrible
scrape
chapter
xix
ruth
troubles
and
susy
preparations
the
next
day
the
suppressed
excitement
in
the
school
grew
worse
it
is
sad
to
relate
nevertheless
it
is
a
fact
that
kathleen
openly
neglected
her
lessons
she
kept
glancing
at
susy
hopkins
and
susy
hopkins
once
very
boldly
winked
at
her
and
when
she
did
this
one
of
the
under
teachers
saw
her
now
there
were
certain
rules
in
the
school
which
all
the
girls
were
expected
to
keep
and
winking
and
making
faces
were
always
prohibited
but
the
teacher
on
this
occasion
did
not
complain
of
susy
there
were
so
many
other
things
to
be
considered
that
she
thought
she
would
let
the
matter
pass
ruth
craven
was
in
her
class
and
more
than
one
girl
remarked
on
appearance
her
face
was
ghastly
pale
and
she
looked
as
though
she
had
been
crying
very
hard
alice
tennant
was
also
in
her
class
and
she
looked
very
bold
and
upright
and
defiant
nothing
ever
induced
alice
to
neglect
her
studies
for
did
not
the
scholarship
depend
on
her
doing
her
very
utmost
she
worked
just
as
assiduously
as
though
nothing
was
happening
but
each
foundation
girl
at
least
each
who
had
joined
the
wild
irish
girls
pressed
her
hand
against
the
front
of
her
dress
so
as
really
to
be
certain
that
the
little
locket
the
dear
little
talisman
of
her
order
was
safe
in
its
place
and
each
girl
felt
naughty
and
good
at
the
same
time
anxious
to
please
kathleen
and
anxious
to
adhere
to
the
rules
of
the
school
and
each
girl
resolved
that
if
she
had
to
choose
between
the
school
and
kathleen
she
would
throw
the
school
over
and
give
allegiance
to
the
queen
of
the
society
but
ruth
unhappy
face
certainly
attracted
attention
cassandra
weldon
noticed
it
first
of
all
in
recess
she
went
up
to
her
and
took
her
hand
ruth
she
said
you
must
come
home
with
me
to
dinner
afterwards
we
can
have
a
good
chat
and
then
you
shall
have
a
room
to
yourself
in
order
to
work
up
your
lessons
for
miss
renshaw
but
what
is
the
matter
ruth
you
do
look
well
i
am
quite
well
answered
ruth
but
i
do
think
i
be
able
to
come
back
with
you
cassie
oh
what
a
pity
dear
is
your
grandmother
ill
no
she
quite
well
and
your
grandfather
they
are
both
quite
well
it
is
no
it
not
nothing
for
it
is
something
but
i
ca
tell
you
please
do
ask
me
you
look
very
sad
i
feel
miserable
i
wonder
said
cassandra
thoughtfully
ruth
looked
at
her
there
was
absolute
despair
in
the
eyes
generally
so
clear
and
steadfast
and
bright
at
this
moment
kathleen
was
seen
passing
through
the
playground
in
a
sort
of
triumphal
progress
she
was
accompanied
by
quite
a
tail
of
girls
one
hung
on
her
right
arm
another
on
her
left
a
third
danced
in
front
of
her
and
other
girls
followed
in
a
thick
procession
i
feel
like
a
that
has
just
swarmed
she
remarked
to
cassandra
weldon
her
rude
words
the
impertinent
little
toss
of
her
head
and
the
defiant
glance
out
of
her
very
eyes
caused
cassandra
to
stamp
her
foot
ruth
she
said
i
do
like
your
friend
kathleen
but
i
love
her
said
ruth
that
is
just
it
she
makes
you
all
love
her
and
then
she
gets
you
into
trouble
but
getting
into
trouble
for
a
friend
does
make
you
hate
that
friend
said
ruth
well
i
fail
to
understand
her
i
agree
with
alice
tennant
about
her
a
girl
of
that
sort
fascinating
handsome
dangerous
works
havoc
in
a
school
listen
cassie
said
ruth
suddenly
a
good
many
people
will
be
saying
bad
things
about
kathleen
before
long
and
perhaps
you
will
be
questioned
i
know
that
alice
tennant
has
been
questioned
already
will
you
promise
me
something
cassie
you
look
so
imploring
that
i
like
to
promise
you
anything
but
what
is
it
do
take
her
part
when
the
time
comes
you
are
certain
to
be
asked
but
i
do
know
her
how
can
i
take
her
part
you
can
say
oh
the
kindest
things
you
can
explain
that
she
has
always
been
bright
and
gay
and
loving
and
kind
i
do
know
that
she
has
cassie
said
ruth
your
goodness
to
me
has
been
almost
past
understanding
but
i
could
hate
you
if
you
spoke
against
her
for
i
love
her
just
then
a
teacher
came
out
touched
ruth
craven
on
her
arm
and
said
will
you
go
at
once
to
see
miss
ravenscroft
why
have
you
got
into
a
scrape
ruth
is
that
why
you
look
so
pale
and
excited
and
distressed
said
cassandra
she
spoke
in
a
whisper
ruth
eyes
looked
full
into
hers
god
help
me
she
said
under
her
cassie
if
you
knew
if
you
could
guess
you
pity
me
ruth
turned
away
and
followed
the
teacher
into
the
school
a
moment
later
she
was
standing
before
the
now
ruth
said
that
lady
i
have
given
you
as
long
a
time
as
possible
are
you
prepared
to
tell
me
what
you
know
of
the
wild
irish
girls
ruth
was
silent
i
ca
give
you
any
further
time
there
is
to
be
a
meeting
of
the
governors
at
four
this
afternoon
a
special
meeting
convened
in
a
hurry
in
order
to
look
into
this
very
matter
if
you
do
tell
me
in
private
what
you
can
tell
me
i
shall
be
obliged
to
ask
you
to
appear
before
the
governors
in
that
case
it
would
be
a
matter
of
insurrection
on
your
part
and
it
is
very
doubtful
if
you
would
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
school
it
is
very
cruel
to
me
began
ruth
my
dear
the
path
of
right
is
sometimes
cruel
we
must
put
this
matter
down
with
a
strong
hand
do
you
or
do
you
not
know
where
kathleen
and
her
society
are
to
meet
this
evening
i
been
thinking
it
out
said
ruth
i
have
had
no
one
to
consult
if
i
were
to
tell
i
should
be
a
traitor
to
kathleen
i
did
not
care
for
the
society
although
i
love
her
i
joined
it
at
first
i
ca
quite
tell
you
how
but
afterwards
i
left
it
i
left
it
entirely
for
my
own
benefit
there
is
a
girl
in
this
school
whom
you
all
love
and
respect
i
do
suppose
any
other
girl
in
the
whole
school
bears
such
a
high
character
her
name
is
cassandra
weldon
of
course
i
know
cassandra
weldon
said
the
she
is
our
head
girl
she
is
and
she
is
not
proud
and
she
is
oh
so
kind
she
offered
me
a
very
great
help
she
presented
to
me
a
tremendous
temptation
what
was
that
ruth
miss
ravenscroft
began
by
being
cold
and
indifferent
she
was
now
really
interested
you
can
sit
down
if
you
like
she
said
but
ruth
did
not
sit
she
only
put
one
pretty
little
hand
on
the
back
of
a
chair
as
though
to
steady
herself
i
will
tell
you
everything
that
concerns
myself
she
said
i
mind
how
badly
you
think
of
me
i
had
joined
the
other
foundationers
as
a
member
of
kathleen
society
then
cassandra
presented
the
temptation
she
offered
to
give
me
the
services
of
her
coach
miss
renshaw
to
work
up
for
the
ayldice
scholarship
that
means
sixty
pounds
a
year
we
are
poor
at
home
miss
ravenscroft
my
grandfather
and
grandmother
are
very
poor
people
but
my
father
was
a
gentleman
and
my
mother
was
a
lady
and
their
great
longing
in
life
was
to
have
me
well
educated
my
grandparents
can
scarcely
afford
the
expense
of
keeping
me
in
this
school
i
know
i
am
a
foundationer
and
my
education
is
free
but
there
are
other
small
expenses
that
have
to
be
met
even
for
me
to
live
at
home
is
almost
more
than
they
can
compass
you
can
therefore
imagine
the
great
and
wonderful
delight
of
being
able
to
secure
a
scholarship
of
sixty
pounds
a
year
i
could
scarcely
have
managed
it
without
this
help
it
was
noble
of
cassandra
to
offer
it
and
i
i
accepted
it
miss
ravenscroft
after
that
of
course
i
could
remain
in
society
for
kathleen
and
cassandra
hate
each
other
and
i
could
be
one
moment
with
one
girl
and
another
with
the
other
so
i
gave
up
the
society
and
joined
cassandra
but
i
ca
now
betray
those
who
were
my
friends
i
have
made
up
my
mind
i
ca
you
have
really
made
up
your
mind
quite
quite
indeed
i
can
not
do
you
know
what
this
means
i
can
guess
we
shall
be
obliged
to
call
a
meeting
of
the
governors
you
will
be
had
up
before
them
if
you
still
persist
in
keeping
your
knowledge
to
yourself
they
will
be
obliged
to
strike
your
name
off
the
school
roll
you
will
not
then
be
able
to
get
the
ayldice
scholarship
you
are
a
clever
girl
ruth
my
dear
child
the
whole
thing
is
a
mistake
you
do
wrong
to
conceal
insurrection
i
can
tell
your
special
friend
kathleen
who
will
no
longer
be
queen
of
the
wild
irish
girls
morning
that
i
have
forced
this
confession
out
of
you
she
will
not
hate
you
she
will
forgive
you
she
will
understand
my
dear
why
should
you
sacrifice
everything
for
the
sake
of
this
naughty
irish
girl
because
i
love
her
and
because
it
would
be
mean
answered
ruth
and
now
she
burst
into
tears
miss
ravenscroft
talked
to
her
a
little
longer
but
ruth
was
firm
when
she
left
the
presence
she
felt
a
certain
sense
almost
of
elation
now
i
do
feel
so
absolutely
horrible
she
said
to
herself
of
course
i
will
face
the
governors
i
will
just
say
that
i
know
but
that
i
ca
tell
yes
i
believe
i
have
done
right
anyhow
i
do
feel
quite
so
bad
as
before
i
went
to
see
miss
ravenscroft
meanwhile
susy
hopkins
was
having
a
busy
time
she
went
to
school
in
the
morning
but
as
soon
as
ever
lesson
hours
were
over
she
flew
back
to
her
mother
shop
there
hopkins
awaited
her
with
a
tray
full
of
good
things
now
susy
she
said
tom
will
help
you
for
i
have
got
him
to
promise
he
will
borrow
a
wheelbarrow
and
all
the
things
can
be
stacked
away
tidily
into
it
and
he
will
take
them
straight
off
to
aunt
church
house
with
you
immediately
after
dinner
you
had
best
spend
the
afternoon
with
the
old
lady
and
encourage
her
all
you
can
it
is
a
blessed
relief
to
have
two
months
of
that
debt
wiped
out
and
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
child
and
i
will
help
you
all
i
can
you
ca
think
how
exciting
it
is
mother
said
susy
and
you
know
the
best
of
the
fun
is
they
are
making
no
end
of
a
fuss
in
the
school
they
trying
to
find
out
all
about
poor
kathleen
society
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
it
and
to
call
the
foundationers
to
order
but
the
only
effect
of
the
fuss
is
to
make
more
and
more
of
the
girls
want
to
join
i
saw
kathleen
for
a
few
minutes
this
morning
and
she
said
that
she
had
twelve
applications
for
badges
already
but
she
told
the
new
girls
that
they
had
best
not
come
to
the
meeting
as
there
would
be
room
for
them
kathleen
is
in
the
highest
spirits
she
is
just
laughing
and
dancing
about
and
looking
like
a
sunbeam
dear
dear
said
hopkins
i
do
hope
it
nothing
wicked
you
girls
of
the
present
day
are
so
queer
there
no
being
up
to
half
your
pranks
it
would
be
a
sorry
day
for
me
if
you
were
banished
from
the
school
susy
oh
i
wo
be
it
will
be
all
right
anyhow
this
is
delicious
fun
and
i
mean
to
go
on
with
it
what
have
you
got
for
the
old
lady
tea
mother
well
now
look
here
of
course
she
only
going
to
give
tea
to
miss
and
miss
i
have
seen
that
lady
and
yourself
and
tom
that
about
all
and
tom
will
have
a
pretty
keen
appetite
said
susy
i
tell
miss
kathleen
that
she
is
to
be
at
aunt
church
house
quite
before
the
rest
of
the
girls
so
that
aunty
can
have
her
talk
with
her
and
arrange
about
the
almshouse
and
also
that
kathleen
and
miss
may
have
their
meal
in
comfort
what
the
grub
mother
tell
me
at
once
said
hopkins
beginning
to
count
on
her
fingers
a
pot
of
oh
golloptious
burst
from
susy
a
plumcake
better
and
better
cried
susy
a
little
tin
of
sardines
some
ladies
are
fond
of
a
savory
yes
mother
quite
right
and
so
is
aunty
for
that
matter
you
forgotten
the
have
you
here
a
great
bunch
of
it
you
must
turn
the
tap
over
it
and
wash
it
as
clean
as
clean
and
what
with
eggs
and
tea
with
cream
in
it
and
why
i
think
that
about
enough
so
it
is
mother
and
it
beautiful
but
mother
i
do
think
aunt
church
would
relish
a
pound
of
sausages
it
is
often
she
has
anything
of
that
kind
to
eat
she
lives
very
penuriously
you
know
mother
well
i
suppose
i
can
fling
in
the
sausages
i
just
run
round
to
the
shop
and
buy
them
now
then
eat
your
own
dinner
susy
and
be
quick
tom
has
eaten
his
and
has
gone
to
fetch
the
wheelbarrow
from
dan
smith
the
cartwright
hopkins
programme
was
carried
out
tom
arrived
at
the
door
with
the
wheelbarrow
about
two
the
provisions
were
stowed
safely
away
in
the
bottom
and
covered
over
with
a
piece
of
old
matting
and
then
tom
and
susy
started
off
both
boy
and
girl
were
in
high
spirits
the
day
was
as
fine
as
it
had
been
on
the
previous
day
and
susy
chattered
to
her
heart
content
my
word
said
tom
i
must
be
in
it
but
you
ca
tom
you
are
a
boy
that
would
be
the
final
straw
if
the
ladies
of
the
school
and
those
awful
governors
were
to
come
along
and
to
see
a
boy
in
the
midst
of
forty
girls
i
do
believe
we
all
be
put
in
prison
you
must
clear
out
thomas
make
up
your
mind
to
that
as
soon
as
ever
you
have
handed
over
the
things
to
aunt
church
you
wait
and
see
said
tom
you
may
suppose
you
are
a
favorite
with
aunt
church
but
you
are
nothing
at
all
to
me
i
can
just
twist
her
round
my
fingers
it
a
fine
time
i
mean
to
have
i
wo
worry
you
at
all
when
you
are
having
your
commotion
in
the
yard
for
the
matter
of
that
i
creep
into
the
with
brownie
and
we
can
look
over
the
doorway
oh
tom
you
are
certain
to
be
discovered
and
you
just
pinch
that
pig
and
make
him
squeal
like
anything
tom
laughed
i
mean
to
have
my
fun
he
said
and
do
you
suppose
for
a
moment
i
going
to
funk
a
lot
of
stupid
silly
girls
how
much
do
you
think
i
going
to
eat
miss
i
sure
you
are
going
to
be
horribly
greedy
but
perhaps
when
you
see
miss
and
miss
you
take
a
fit
of
shyness
it
to
be
hoped
you
will
shyness
cried
tom
what
that
it
what
you
ought
to
have
tom
and
it
to
be
hoped
you
will
have
it
when
the
time
comes
looks
like
it
cried
tom
rubbing
his
hands
in
a
meaning
way
never
frightened
of
anybody
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
mean
to
have
a
lark
with
your
pretty
miss
kathleen
mean
to
get
a
sov
or
two
out
of
that
charming
miss
mean
to
coax
aunty
church
to
give
me
that
microscope
when
she
moves
across
the
sea
to
ireland
tell
you
susy
i
up
to
a
lark
and
the
best
of
the
supper
goes
down
my
throat
now
you
know
and
there
no
use
worriting
for
what
ca
be
cured
must
be
endured
tom
hopkins
is
part
and
parcel
of
this
feast
and
the
sooner
you
make
up
your
mind
to
endure
me
the
better
susy
felt
slightly
alarmed
but
she
knew
from
experience
that
tom
bark
was
worse
than
his
bite
and
she
trusted
to
aunt
church
desiring
him
in
a
peremptory
manner
to
go
when
the
time
approached
and
to
tom
being
forced
to
obey
her
they
arrived
in
good
time
at
their
destination
and
church
received
them
figuratively
with
open
arms
and
now
began
the
real
fuss
and
the
real
preparation
tom
took
a
brush
and
kicked
up
as
aunt
church
expressed
it
no
end
of
a
shindy
the
little
was
a
cloud
of
dust
the
table
the
chairs
and
the
little
sideboard
were
pushed
about
everything
seemed
to
be
at
a
loss
until
susy
peremptorily
took
the
duster
out
of
tom
hand
and
reduced
chaos
to
order
then
the
tea
was
unpacked
a
very
white
cloth
from
hopkins
most
precious
store
was
produced
real
silver
spoons
from
the
same
source
made
their
appearance
a
few
cups
and
saucers
of
good
old
china
were
added
the
table
looked
as
tom
expressed
it
very
genteel
then
the
provisions
were
placed
upon
the
board
now
we
are
ready
said
church
and
i
must
say
she
added
that
i
am
pleased
i
have
known
good
genteel
living
in
my
lifetime
and
i
expect
that
providence
means
me
to
know
it
again
before
i
die
susy
and
tom
you
are
both
good
children
you
have
your
spice
of
wickedness
in
you
but
when
all
is
said
and
done
you
mean
well
and
i
may
as
well
promise
you
both
now
that
when
i
get
to
ireland
i
will
have
you
over
in
the
holidays
you
will
enjoy
that
wo
you
thomas
see
if
i
do
aunt
church
and
i
always
was
your
own
boy
was
i
and
you
wo
mind
old
lady
say
you
wo
mind
leaving
me
the
microscope
when
you
cross
the
briny
i
fairly
taken
with
that
microscope
i
dream
of
it
at
night
and
think
of
it
every
minute
of
the
day
come
here
and
look
me
in
the
eyes
tom
said
church
tom
went
over
out
of
his
freckled
face
there
beamed
two
honest
eyes
his
forehead
was
broad
and
slightly
bulgy
his
carroty
hair
was
cut
short
to
his
head
church
raised
her
wrinkled
old
hand
and
laid
it
for
a
minute
on
tom
forehead
you
resemble
your
my
husband
she
said
he
was
the
cleverest
man
i
ever
came
across
he
had
a
real
turn
for
the
microscope
then
of
course
you
will
leave
it
behind
you
of
course
you
will
give
it
to
me
said
tom
quite
triumphant
with
eagerness
no
my
boy
that
i
wo
if
you
are
a
good
boy
and
do
me
credit
and
get
on
with
your
books
and
do
well
in
that
calling
which
providence
means
you
to
work
in
why
i
may
leave
it
to
you
when
i
am
called
hence
tom
there
tom
said
susy
coming
forward
do
worry
aunt
church
any
more
she
got
plenty
to
think
wo
you
turn
him
out
now
aunt
church
it
is
time
for
you
to
be
dressing
you
know
so
it
is
said
church
looking
round
her
in
some
alarm
whatever
is
the
hour
child
it
is
going
on
for
six
and
they
will
be
here
at
seven
at
the
latest
very
well
said
tom
if
i
must
go
i
will
have
a
talk
with
brownie
he
looked
at
susy
as
if
he
meant
to
defy
her
but
susy
was
too
wise
to
anger
him
at
that
moment
as
soon
as
ever
he
was
out
of
the
house
she
fetched
hot
water
soap
and
a
clean
towel
having
helped
old
church
with
her
ablutions
she
produced
a
clean
cap
and
a
little
black
shawl
the
old
lady
said
that
she
felt
very
smart
and
refreshed
and
altogether
in
a
state
to
do
honor
to
that
dear
little
almshouse
i
am
quite
taking
to

marshal
those
dreadful
girls

mischief
he
means
to
witness
all
the
proceedings
of
dear
miss
kathleen
great
society
and
we
ought
to
let
him
it
would
do
a
lot
of
mischief
if
the
school
heard
of
it
and
we
would
most
likely
be
expelled
he
do
mind
a
word
i
say
so
will
you
talk
to
him
aunty
but
he
ca
be
in

yard
without
being
seen

say
that
they
are
bringing
lamps
and
will
make
the
place
as
bright
as

but
he
will
be
in
the
sty
with
brownie
and
he
as
good
as
said
he
give
her
a
pinch
to
make
her
squeal

afraid
that

to
me
this
minute
susy
went
out
and
called
her
brother
there

a
minute
then
tom
appeared
looking
somewhat
rakish
and
disheveled
brownie
and
i
were
chumming
up
like
anything
he
said
then
he
pushed
susy
aside
and
walked
into
the
old
lady
presence
what
she
said
to
him
even
susy
did
not
hear
but
when
the
little
girl
returned
to

to
be
seen

chapter
xx
the
governors
of
the
school
examine
ruth
at
four
that
afternoon
the
governors
of
the
great
shirley
school
met
in
the
room
set
aside
for
the
purpose
there
were
six
governors
and
they
were
all
ladies
their
names
were
miss
mackenzie
naylor
ross
the
two
misses
scott
and
miss
jane
smyth
the
founders
of
the
great
shirley
school
had
ordained
that
it
should
always
be
governed
by
women
that
women
should
conduct
its
concerns
should
see
to
the
best
possible
education
of
its
pupils
and
should
manage
these
things
to
the
best
of
their
ability
even
the
trustees
of
the
trust
fund
were
women
amongst
these
ladies
miss
mackenzie
was
reckoned
as
head
she
was
a
tall
woman
with
hair
false
teeth
a
prominent
nose
and
small
eyes
miss
mackenzie
was
between
sixty
and
seventy
years
of
age
she
always
dressed
in
the
severest
and
most
manner
and
wore
her
hair
in
ringlets
on
each
side
of
her
head
she
was
an
excellent
woman
of
business
and
was
dreaded
not
only
by
the
schoolgirls
but
also
by
one
or
two
of
the
ladies
of
the
committee
those
who
most
feared
her
were
the
two
misses
scott
and
miss
jane
smyth
ross
was
a
fashionable
woman
who
went
a
good
deal
into
london
society
talked
about
the
great
shirley
school
to
her
different
friends
and
was
considered
an
expert
on
the
subject
of
girls
education
ross
had
a
husband
and
a
beautiful
home
she
dressed
remarkably
well
and
was
looked
down
on
in
consequence
by
miss
mackenzie
naylor
was
the
oldest
of
the
governors
she
was
a
little
wizened
lady
with
a
face
like
a
russet
apple
a
kindly
smile
and
a
sweet
voice
it
was
the
custom
of
the
governors
to
meet
four
times
a
year
as
a
matter
of
course
and
as
a
matter
of
expediency
they
met
about
as
many
times
again
but
a
sudden
meeting
to
be
convened
within
notice
was
almost
unheard
of
in
their
experience
when
they
were
all
seated
round
the
table
miss
mackenzie
who
was
chairwoman
took
out
the
agenda
and
read
its
contents
aloud
these
were
brief
enough
to
inquire
into
the
insurrection
amongst
the
foundationers
and
in
particular
to
cause
full
investigation
to
be
made
with
regard
to
the
irish
girl
kathleen
this
is
really
very
astonishing
said
miss
mackenzie
turning
to
the
other
governors
an
insurrection
amongst
the
foundationers
had
we
not
better
summon
miss
ravenscroft
who
will
tell
us
what
she
means
a
clerk
who
attended
the
meetings
also
a
woman
went
away
now
to
summon
miss
ravenscroft
she
appeared
in
a
few
minutes
was
asked
to
seat
herself
and
was
requested
to
give
a
full
explanation
this
she
did
very
briefly
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
she
said
a
girl
of
the
name
of
kathleen
joined
our
number
she
was
eccentric
and
untrained
she
came
from
the
of
ireland
i
had
her
examined
and
found
that
she
knew
extremely
little
we
were
forced
to
put
her
into
much
too
low
a
class
for
her
years
and
general
appearance
well
said
miss
smyth
that
after
all
is
a
crime
i
do
quite
understand
if
you
will
kindly
resume
your
story
we
shall
be
obliged
miss
ravenscroft
said
miss
mackenzie
miss
ravenscroft
did
resume
it
she
traced
kathleen
conduct
from
the
first
day
of
her
arrival
to
the
present
hour
short
as
the
time
was
not
more
than
six
weeks
she
had
worked
havoc
in
the
school
her
influence
was
altogether
felt
amongst
the
foundationers
they
crowded
round
her
at
all
hours
a
glance
from
her
eyes
was
sufficient
to
compel
them
to
do
exactly
what
she
wished
they
ceased
to
be
attentive
to
their
lessons
they
were
often
discovered
in
school
in
a
state
of
they
were
rebellious
and
impertinent
to
their
teachers
in
short
they
were
in
a
state
of
insurrection
and
you
trace
this
disgraceful
state
of
things
to
the
advent
of
the
irish
girl
said
miss
mackenzie
i
am
sorry
to
say
miss
mackenzie
that
i
do
when
i
noticed
that
kathleen
had
a
disturbing
influence
over
the
girls
i
caused
further
inquiries
to
be
made
and
i
then
made
a
discovery
which
distressed
me
very
much
my
eyes
were
first
opened
by
the
fact
that
one
of
our
teachers
picked
up
off
the
floor
just
where
a
certain
clara
sawyer
one
of
the
best
and
most
promising
of
the
foundationers
was
sitting
a
small
locket
evidently
a
badge
she
brought
it
to
me
and
i
now
hand
it
to
you
ladies
for
inspection
the
little
silver
badge
was
passed
from
one
lady
to
another
the
misses
scott
thought
it
pretty
and
quaint
miss
jane
smyth
murmured
the
words
wild
irish
girls
under
her
breath
ross
pushed
it
away
from
her
as
though
it
was
beneath
notice
naylor
said
very
pretty
quite
touching
is
it
i
always
think
that
such
a
sweet
emblem
do
you
miss
mackenzie
but
miss
mackenzie
with
a
sniff
took
up
the
little
talisman
and
turned
it
from
right
to
left
irish
girls
she
said
aloud
what
can
this
mean
i
can
throw
some
light
on
the
subject
but
not
much
said
miss
ravenscroft
it
is
quite
evident
that
a
society
calling
itself
by
this
name
exists
and
that
it
has
been
instituted
and
formed
altogether
by
kathleen
who
has
induced
a
great
number
i
should
say
fully
half
of
the
foundationers
to
join
her
they
meet
i
have
discovered
at
night
their
rendezvous
being
up
to
the
present
a
certain
quarry
a
short
distance
out
of
town
what
they
do
at
their
meetings
i
can
not
tell
but
i
believe
they
are
very
riotous
with
singing
and
dancing
and
sports
of
all
sorts
of
course
as
you
know
miss
mackenzie
such
proceedings
are
altogether
prohibited
in
our
school
but
this
takes
place
out
of
school
said
naylor
naylor
i
should
be
much
obliged
if
you
would
allow
miss
ravenscroft
to
continue
said
miss
mackenzie
miss
ravenscroft
did
continue
putting
aside
that
question
she
said
the
effect
on
the
girls
is
most
disastrous
they
are
completely
out
of
my
control
and
i
know
for
a
fact
that
they
do
not
care
to
please
any
one
except
kathleen
of
course
our
duty
is
plain
said
miss
mackenzie
we
must
get
the
ringleader
into
custody
so
to
speak
and
either
bind
her
over
to
break
up
the
society
and
so
keep
the
peace
or
expel
her
from
the
school
she
is
a
difficult
girl
to
deal
with
said
miss
ravenscroft
she
has
a
great
deal
that
is
good
in
her
she
is
handsome
and
rich
very
affectionate
and
full
of
spirit
but
what
has
a
girl
who
is
handsome
and
rich
to
do
in
a
school
like
the
great
shirley
asked
ross
that
is
the
curious
part
of
it
kathleen
mother
was
educated
in
this
school
and
she
made
up
her
mind
that
her
daughter
should
never
go
to
any
other
kathleen
lives
with
the
tennants
i
should
be
sorry
if
she
were
expelled
there
is
so
much
that
is
good
in
her
it
would
be
a
pity
to
harden
her
or
hold
her
up
to
public
disgrace
i
hope
some
other
way
may
be
discovered
of
bringing
her
to
order
you
are
quite
right
miss
ravenscroft
said
miss
smyth
i
never
did
hold
with
the
severe
hardening
process
certainly
in
the
case
of
kathleen
it
would
do
no
good
said
miss
ravenscroft
but
what
do
you
propose
to
do
then
said
miss
mackenzie
you
have
not
i
presume
asked
us
to
come
here
without
having
some
plan
in
your
head
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
get
hold
of
all
possible
facts
said
miss
ravenscroft
now
there
is
one
girl
in
the
school
who
could
tell
us
a
charming
girl
a
new
girl
for
she
also
only
joined
this
term
but
in
all
respects
the
opposite
of
kathleen
she
for
a
short
time
belonged
to
the
rebels
as
i
must
call
the
wild
irish
girls
but
she
saw
the
folly
of
her
conduct
and
left
them
she
could
tell
us
all
about
them
if
she
liked
and
help
us
to
bring
the
insurrection
to
an
end
then
that
is
capital
said
miss
mackenzie
in
a
tone
of
enjoyment
have
the
girl
summoned
please
miss
ravenscroft
miss
ravenscroft
turned
to
the
clerk
who
went
away
at
once
in
search
of
ruth
ruth
came
in
looking
very
white
her
face
dogged
her
usual
beauty
and
charm
of
manner
having
quite
deserted
her
she
wore
her
little
and
she
kept
folding
it
between
her
fingers
as
she
stood
in
the
presence
of
her
judges
your
name
said
miss
mackenzie
ruth
craven
your
age
i
am
fourteen
where
do
you
live
in
no
willow
cottages
oh
i
know
said
miss
mackenzie
looking
with
more
approval
at
the
child
i
have
often
met
your
grandfather
you
live
with
him
and
his
wife
do
you
yes
madam
and
you
have
been
admitted
here
as
a
foundationer
yes
madam
in
what
class
is
ruth
craven
miss
ravenscroft
ruth
is
a
very
diligent
pupil
she
is
in
the
third
remove
replied
miss
ravenscroft
looking
with
kindly
eyes
at
the
child
ruth
just
glanced
at
her
teacher
and
then
lowered
her
eyes
her
beautiful
little
face
was
beginning
to
have
its
usual
effect
upon
most
of
the
ladies
present
some
of
the
stony
despair
had
left
it
the
color
came
and
went
in
her
cheeks
she
ceased
to
fiddle
with
her
apron
and
clasped
her
two
little
white
hands
tightly
together
my
child
said
naylor
your
object
in
coming
to
school
is
doubtless
the
best
object
of
all
ruth
raised
inquiring
eyes
i
mean
said
the
little
old
lady
that
you
want
to
learn
all
you
can
to
gain
knowledge
and
wisdom
to
learn
goodness
and
forbearance
and
and
charity
oh
yes
said
ruth
her
eyes
dilating
if
continued
miss
mackenzie
interrupting
naylor
and
speaking
in
a
very
firm
tone
if
instead
of
these
pleasant
things
happening
a
little
girl
learns
to
join
insurrectionists
to
forget
those
to
whom
she
is
indebted
for
such
tremendous
advantages
then
how
do
matters
stand
eh
ruth
craven
i
do
understand
said
ruth
her
trembling
and
fear
had
come
back
to
her
the
dear
child
is
frightened
miss
mackenzie
said
naylor
i
hope
not
said
miss
mackenzie
but
i
as
chairwoman
am
obliged
to
question
ruth
craven
is
it
true
that
you
became
a
member
of
a
silly
schoolgirl
society
called
the
wild
irish
girls
and
that
you
wore
a
badge
like
this
ruth
nodded
do
nod
to
me
speak
it
is
true
said
ruth
are
you
now
a
member
of
that
society
no
why
did
you
join
it
because
i
loved
kathleen
she
is
the
promoter
then
ruth
was
silent
you
have
heard
me
yes
madam
kathleen
is
the
promoter
again
ruth
was
silent
miss
mackenzie
glanced
at
the
other
ladies
after
a
pause
she
continued
we
will
leave
that
matter
for
the
present
please
write
down
miss
judson
here
she
turned
to
the
clerk
that
ruth
craven
has
refused
to
answer
my
question
with
regard
to
kathleen
we
will
return
to
that
point
later
why
did
you
leave
the
society
i
did
so
because
i
wanted
to
join
a
scheme
proposed
by
a
girl
who
was
not
a
foundationer
and
not
a
member
of
the
society
her
name
is
cassandra
weldon
one
of
our
best
and
most
promising
pupils
interrupted
miss
ravenscroft
i
know
her
said
miss
mackenzie
we
have
every
reason
to
be
proud
of
cassandra
and
so
she
this
charming
and
excellent
cassandra
weldon
is
your
friend
little
ruth
craven
she
has
been
extremely
good
to
me
madam
she
offered
me
the
services
of
her
own
coach
in
order
that
i
might
work
up
for
the
ayldice
scholarship
and
do
you
think
you
have
a
chance
of
getting
it
i
do
know
i
mean
to
try
her
eyes
flashed
with
intelligence
and
longing
as
she
uttered
these
words
i
think
we
are
now
in
possession
of
the
facts
said
miss
mackenzie
is
that
not
so
ross
ruth
craven
was
a
member
of
the
objectionable
society
she
very
wisely
left
it
knowing
that
she
would
better
herself
by
doing
now
then
ruth
we
expect
you
to
tell
us
all
about
the
society
where
it
meets
and
as
much
as
you
know
about
its
rules
and
you
must
also
acquaint
us
with
the
names
of
the
girls
who
are
members
ruth
again
was
silent
but
now
she
held
herself
erect
and
looked
full
at
miss
mackenzie
you
hear
me
child
speak
you
can
make
your
narrative
brief
where
does
the
society
meet
what
does
it
do
what
are
its
rules
go
on
you
are
not
stupid
are
you
no
miss
mackenzie
said
ruth
i
am
not
stupid
and
i
am
very
sorry
indeed
to
seem
rude
but
i
can
not
answer
your
questions
you
know
that
kathleen
society
exists
that
fact
i
can
not
hide
from
you
but
you
will
not
hear
anything
more
from
me
it
would
be
a
very
terrible
thing
for
me
to
be
expelled
from
this
school
it
would
mean
great
sorrow
to
my
grandfather
and
grandmother
but
i
can
not
betray
my
friend
kathleen
nor
any
of
the
other
girls
of
the
society
miss
mackenzie
was
silent
for
quite
a
minute
the
other
ladies
fidgeted
as
they
sat
ruth
having
delivered
her
soul
looked
down
after
a
long
pause
miss
mackenzie
said
quite
gently
ruth
craven
you
scarcely
realize
your
own
position
we
can
not
possibly
let
a
little
girl
who
is
rebellious
who
keeps
secrets
to
herself
which
she
ought
to
tell
for
the
benefit
of
the
school
continue
in
our
midst
we
will
give
you
three
days
to
think
over
this
matter
if
at
the
end
of
three
days
you
are
still
obstinately
silent
there
is
nothing
whatever
for
it
but
that
you
should
be
expelled
from
the
school
do
you
understand
what
that
means
it
means
that
i
must
go
that
i
shall
lose
all
the
advantages
said
ruth
it
means
that
and
more
it
means
that
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
school
you
are
pronounced
unworthy
that
you
leave
the
school
publicly
being
desired
to
do
so
by
your
teacher
it
is
an
unpleasant
ceremony
and
one
which
you
will
never
be
able
to
forget
it
will
haunt
you
for
life
ruth
craven
i
trust
however
my
dear
child
that
such
extreme
measures
will
not
be
necessary
you
think
now
that
you
are
honorable
in
making
yourself
a
martyr
but
it
is
not
so
we
who
are
old
must
know
more
than
you
can
possibly
know
ruth
with
regard
to
the
benefits
of
a
great
establishment
like
this
insurrection
must
be
put
down
with
a
firm
hand
you
will
see
for
yourself
how
right
we
are
and
how
wrong
and
silly
and
childish
you
miss
ravenscroft
a
special
meeting
of
the
governors
will
take
place
in
this
room
on
saturday
morning
this
is
wednesday
until
then
we
hope
that
ruth
craven
will
carefully
consider
her
conduct
and
be
prepared
to
answer
the
very
vital
questions
which
will
be
put
to
you
can
go
ruth
ruth
left
the
room
an
extraordinary
child
said
miss
mackenzie
a
sweet
child
i
call
her
said
naylor
what
a
beautiful
face
my
dear
naylor
does
the
beauty
of
ruth
craven
face
affect
this
question
she
is
in
my
opinion
extremely
silly
and
a
very
naughty
miss
ravenscroft
we
leave
it
to
you
to
bring
the
little
girl
to
reason
i
have
known
her
grandfather
ever
since
he
kept
a
grocer
shop
in
the
high
street
i
have
respected
him
more
than
any
man
i
ever
knew
this
child
in
appearance
is
one
of
nature
ladies
but
we
must
get
her
to
see
things
in
the
right
light
and
if
necessary
she
must
be
made
an
example
of
it
will
be
very
painful
but
it
must
be
done
i
will
do
what
i
can
said
miss
ravenscroft
but
from
the
little
i
have
seen
of
ruth
i
imagine
she
would
go
to
the
stake
before
she
would
betray
those
who
are
kind
to
her
i
will
however
confide
in
cassandra
she
is
extremely
fond
of
ruth
and
she
may
influence
her
where
others
fail
i
ca
help
saying
miss
mackenzie
that
it
would
be
a
very
terrible
thing
and
would
i
believe
much
injure
the
school
if
a
girl
like
ruth
were
expelled
the
other
foundationers
would
feel
it
there
would
be
a
sense
of
martyrdom
sides
would
be
taken
for
and
against
her
i
trust
that
this
extreme
step
will
not
be
necessary
if
she
does
not
tell
us
what
she
knows
it
will
be
not
only
necessary
but
it
will
be
carried
into
effect
and
in
my
presence
said
miss
mackenzie
but
now
to
return
to
the
more
immediate
business
you
say
these
girls
meet
in
a
quarry
i
have
heard
rumors
to
that
effect
do
you
think
they
meet
there
every
night
are
their
scandalous
proceedings
a
nightly
occurrence
oh
no
i
do
not
think
they
meet
oftener
than
once
a
week
have
you
any
idea
what
night
they
choose
i
am
rather
under
the
impression
that
this
is
the
night
then
send
some
one
to
see
miss
ravenscroft
one
or
two
of
the
teachers
would
be
the
best
they
could
go
to
the
quarry
and
wait
there
in
order
to
see
if
the
girls
arrive
if
they
do
my
orders
are
that
they
take
no
apparent
notice
of
them
but
write
down
the
names
of
all
present
if
that
can
be
done
and
you
are
successful
in
finding
the
girls
we
shall
have
the
matter
as
it
were
in
a
nutshell
and
we
shall
soon
crush
this
disgraceful
rebellion
and
what
about
kathleen
asked
miss
ravenscroft
there
is
very
little
doubt
that
she
will
have
to
be
expelled
such
a
girl
as
that
is
a
firebrand
in
a
school
and
however
rich
she
may
be
and
however
the
sooner
she
leaves
us
the
better
chapter
xxi
the
society
meets
at
church
cottage
that
evening
at
about
a
quarter
to
eight
a
band
of
perfectly
silent
girls
might
have
been
seen
walking
along
the
road
that
led
to
church
cottage
they
walked
as
much
as
possible
on
the
grass
and
glided
in
single
file
each
one
as
they
expressed
it
had
her
heart
in
her
mouth
occasionally
they
looked
behind
them
sometimes
they
started
at
an
ordinary
shadow
thinking
that
a
policeman
at
least
would
be
waiting
for
them
the
foundationers
who
called
themselves
the
wild
irish
girls
had
very
little
doubt
what
it
would
mean
if
their
scheme
was
discovered
they
knew
of
course
that
miss
ravenscroft
would
be
furiously
angry
that
the
governors
would
have
something
to
say
to
them
and
that
they
might
be
dismissed
from
the
school
unless
they
promised
to
cease
to
belong
to
the
society
perhaps
there
were
worse
things
than
that
there
was
a
timid
little
girl
called
janey
ford
who
whispered
to
her
friend
that
the
wild
irish
girls
belonged
to
the
rebels
in
ireland
and
that
it
might
be
considered
necessary
by
the
government
of
the
country
to
have
them
taken
up
and
put
into
prison
nobody
for
a
single
moment
believed
janey
ford
silly
remarks
but
nevertheless
they
gave
a
sort
of
thrill
to
the
occasion
it
was
all
delightful
this
stealing
away
in
the
dark
this
pressing
one
against
another
as
they
walked
down
the
little
road
and
then
kathleen
was
so
fascinating
her
eyes
were
so
bright
she
was
such
a
valiant
sort
of
leader
if
they
were
men
and
she
was
a
man
janey
ford
had
whispered
to
her
great
friend
edith
hart
they
would
follow
her
to
the
death
we
form
a
crusade
for
her
edith
had
whispered
back
she
is
magnificent
and
then
both
girls
felt
the
little
lockets
round
their
necks
and
thought
of
themselves
as
heroines
the
entire
party
numbering
about
in
all
arrived
at
the
cottage
susy
suddenly
put
in
her
appearance
girls
she
said
it
is
at
all
certain
that
we
are
safe
i
saw
a
man
going
by
not
ten
minutes
ago
and
he
looked
suspiciously
at
the
house
miss
ravenscroft
would
do
anything
to
catch
us
but
aunt
church
says
that
if
you
go
into
the
yard
she
does
think
you
will
be
seen
or
may
i
take
the
girls
into
the
yard
kathleen
and
may
i
take
you
and
miss
into
the
house
to
see
aunt
church
kathleen
nodded
in
reply
she
also
felt
excited
and
pleased
and
completely
carried
out
of
herself
susy
ushered
her
visitors
with
great
pride
and
pomp
into
little
really
she
felt
herself
quite
rising
in
the
social
scale
as
she
saw
her
old
relative
dressed
in
her
best
with
the
manners
she
used
to
wear
when
she
was
housekeeper
at
lord
henshel
and
with
that
most
appetizing
most
tea
on
the
table
i
will
be
back
in
a
minute
said
aunt
church
here
they
are
and
i
know
you
will
give
them
welcome
i
am
proud
to
do
that
said
church
i
presume
i
am
talking
to
miss
will
you
take
a
chair
here
by
the
fire
miss
i
afraid
the
night
is
a
little
bit
miss
kathleen
i
wish
i
could
get
up
and
offer
you
a
seat
but
as
it
is
oh
nonsense
said
kathleen
what
are
young
legs
for
if
not
to
wait
on
old
legs
oh
what
a
heavenly
delicious
tea
what
is
that
i
see
honey
oh
do
i
just
adore
honey
do
you
aunt
katie
that
i
do
said
miss
and
i
eat
it
comb
and
all
it
never
yet
disagreed
with
me
but
then
i
got
the
digestion
of
an
ostrich
indeed
then
madam
i
think
you
are
rather
silly
to
eat
the
comb
said
church
and
you
ought
always
to
put
butter
on
your
bread
when
you
eat
honey
my
poor
mother
told
me
so
and
i
have
always
followed
in
her
steps
if
you
butter
your
bread
and
do
eat
the
comb
honey
agrees
with
you
as
well
as
anything
else
church
said
kathleen
you
are
perfectly
sweet
and
i
ca
tell
you
how
grateful
we
are
but
we
are
in
something
of
a
hurry
so
perhaps
you
would
mind
telling
the
rest
of
that
story
about
butter
and
honey
to
aunt
katie
when
you
are
in
ireland
have
you
made
the
tea
church
shall
i
make
it
the
tea
is
in
that
little
brown
caddy
said
church
and
a
measuring
spoon
close
to
it
i
allow
oh
i
know
said
kathleen
she
began
to
ladle
out
spoonful
after
spoonful
and
put
it
into
the
little
brown
teapot
which
she
then
filled
up
with
hot
water
church
looked
on
with
a
mingled
feeling
of
approval
and
disapproval
she
was
being
carried
completely
off
her
feet
she
to
give
up
her
dear
little
neat
house
in
this
reckless
way
she
to
give
up
her
most
precious
tea
to
be
absolutely
wasted
and
practically
lost
for
kathleen
put
in
quite
three
times
too
much
tea
into
the
little
teapot
she
to
forgive
susy
mother
two
months
of
that
debt
which
she
owed
her
oh
what
did
it
mean
she
was
going
to
be
ruined
in
her
old
age
i
just
like
to
say
miss
she
said
looking
at
miss
and
then
at
kathleen
i
like
to
say
that
i
am
willing
to
help
the
young
ladies
and
the
old
ladies
too
for
that
matter
but
i
want
to
know
if
it
is
settled
that
i
am
to
have
the
almshouse
and
six
shillings
a
week
i
am
a
body
and
i
like
to
know
it
for
if
so
it
can
be
done
i
ought
to
give
notice
to
the
landlord
of
this
little
house
where
i
have
lived
in
peace
and
comfort
for
over
twelve
years
i
like
to
know
and
as
soon
as
possible
we
have
written
about
it
church
said
miss
i
wrote
to
my
this
very
day
and
i
expect
an
answer
soon
of
course
we
ca
tell
you
to
a
certainty
whether
the
house
is
still
to
be
had
but
i
did
hear
that
it
was
let
we
must
hope
for
the
best
and
if
it
is
let
said
kathleen
suddenly
running
up
to
the
old
lady
and
whispering
in
her
ear
i
get
dad
to
send
me
a
cheque
and
you
shall
have
it
so
you
wo
lose
one
way
or
the
other
this
whisper
of
kathleen
was
very
soothing
to
church
she
nodded
her
head
twice
and
said
thank
you
dear
and
just
then
susy
returned
and
tea
began
in
real
earnest
while
the
ladies
were
enjoying
their
meal
they
did
not
observe
that
a
round
boyish
face
occasionally
appeared
at
the
little
glass
partition
which
divided
church
from
her
bedroom
the
glass
reached
down
about
two
feet
from
the
ceiling
and
was
the
only
light
the
bedroom
had
the
boyish
face
bobbed
up
now
and
again
made
appealing
faces
in
church
direction
and
then
disappeared
church
shook
her
head
at
the
apparition
but
for
a
time
no
one
noticed
the
circumstance
then
susy
began
to
observe
it
what
can
it
mean
she
thought
and
she
turned
and
looked
the
face
appeared
the
tongue
now
stuck
into
the
cheek
one
eye
winking
furiously
well
i
never
said
susy
what
are
you
saying
i
never
for
asked
kathleen
and
why
do
you
and
church
keep
gazing
up
at
that
ugly
glass
across
the
room
what
is
the
glass
for
it
is
the
window
that
lights
my
bedroom
miss
said
church
and
i
do
see
she
added
why
i
may
not
look
at
any
part
of
my
own
house
that
i
take
a
fancy
to
of
course
said
kathleen
but
tom
was
now
making
pantomimic
signs
for
refreshments
he
was
touching
his
mouth
which
he
opened
into
a
round
o
pointing
at
the
cake
and
honey
and
going
on
altogether
in
a
way
that
distracted
poor
susy
and
just
as
susy
looked
up
kathleen
looked
up
and
the
latter
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
and
said
i
do
declare
there
a
boy
in
there
the
next
instant
she
had
burst
into
the
bedroom
and
dragged
tom
out
oh
you
are
tom
hopkins
she
said
you
are
susy
brother
now
sit
down
here
and
have
a
right
good
meal
it
was
silly
of
you
to
hide
in
there
as
if
we
minded
but
kathleen
you
ought
to
mind
said
susy
for
it
would
be
the
very
last
straw
if
we
were
discovered
and
there
is
a
boy
found
amongst
us
i
declare
i
never
felt
so
nervous
in
my
do
go
back
to
the
bedroom
aunt
church
ought
he
to
go
come
and
sit
by
me
said
church
and
here
a
fresh
egg
for
you
take
your
place
tom
and
when
the
others
go
into
the
yard
for
their
foolish
mummeries
for
i
ca
make
out
that
there
a
bit
of
sense
in
this
scheme
from
first
to
last
why
you
and
i
will
finish
up
what
is
left
of
the
good
things
you
are
a
brick
aunt
church
said
tom
he
took
a
seat
at
the
table
and
gazed
with
wonder
delight
and
admiration
at
kathleen
he
told
his
schoolfellows
that
at
that
moment
he
lost
his
heart
to
kathleen
he
said
that
she
bowled
him
over
completely
i
have
a
scrap
of
heart
in
my
body
he
remarked
to
his
chosen
friends
i
took
it
out
and
put
it
at
her
feet
and
if
believe
me
she
spurned
it
that
the
way
of
girls
do
you
have
anything
to
do
with
them
boys
but
the
boys
only
begged
more
earnestly
than
ever
to
have
a
look
at
kathleen
tom
finally
promised
to
secure
her
photograph
by
hook
or
by
crook
and
to
show
it
to
them
when
the
meal
which
was
but
a
short
one
after
all
came
to
an
end
miss
and
kathleen
got
up
and
were
preparing
to
go
to
the
yard
at
the
back
of
the
house
when
there
came
the
sound
of
horse
hoofs
on
the
stones
outside
they
stopped
at
the
cottage
and
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
was
next
heard
they
have
come
said
susy
her
face
white
as
a
sheet
i
knew
they
would
i
wonder
what
will
happen
kathleen
are
you
awfully
frightened
not
i
said
kathleen
why
should
i
be
afraid
whoever
is
there
has
nothing
to
do
with
us
susy
state
of
panic
amused
both
miss
and
kathleen
and
tom
was
the
only
one
found
brave
enough
to
go
to
the
door
in
answer
to
the
knock
he
came
back
the
next
instant
with
a
telegram
which
was
addressed
to
miss
she
tore
it
open
and
gave
a
loud
scream
it
my
poor
cousin
peggy
doharty
she
has
fallen
from
her
horse
and
has
concussion
of
the
brain
i
must
go
to
her
at
once
oh
alannah
alannah
what
is
to
be
done
here
miss
turned
a
face
of
anguish
in
kathleen
direction
it
is
i
that
must
leave
you
my
darling
she
said
i
will
go
back
to
town
with
the
messenger
get
off
to
london
and
cross
in
the
morning
ah
the
creature
and
she
my
dearest
friend
let
us
hope
that
providence
will
spare
her
precious
life
oh
dear
dear
dear
this
is
awful
i
do
see
why
you
should
go
aunt
katie
said
kathleen
i
want
you
very
badly
indeed
just
now
then
my
sweet
child
come
straight
away
with
me
to
dublin
for
as
to
leaving
peggy
in
her
hour
of
extremity
i
would
do
it
even
for
you
kathleen
and
that
saying
a
good
deal
but

the
messenger
that
i
will
go
back
with
him
to
merrifield
and
what
about
my
almshouse
screamed
out
church
this
is
a
nice
state
of
things
i
must
say
who
minds
what
a
slip
of
a
young
lady
says
meaning
no
offence
to
you
miss
but
i
have
been
spending
my
money
right
and
left
getting
tea
that
beats
all
for
gentility
and
now
one
of
the
ladies
is
off
as
it
were
in
a
flash
of
an
eye
what
about
my
almshouse
miss
looked
rather
indignant
you
shall
have
your
almshouse
if
it
can
be
got
how
unfeeling
you
are
to
think
only
of
yourself
when
my
dearest
friend
may
be
at
death
door
here
a
sovereign
which
will
more
than
cover
the
expenses
of
the
kathleen
core
of
my
all
of
you
miss
flung
a
sovereign
on
the
table
church
made
a
grab
at
it
and
held
it
tightly
in
her
hand
which
was
covered
by
a
black
mitten
the
next
moment
the
good
lady
had
departed
and
kathleen
looking
thoroughly
bewildered
was
left
alone
dear
dear
she
said
yet
i
am
an
irish
girl
and
i
not
going
to
show
funk
there
are
all
those
poor
girls
waiting
in
the
yard
so
long
i
will
go
to
them
at
once
come
with
me
susy
there
were
about
forty
girls
in
the
yard
and
they
sat
close
together
the
night
was
sufficiently
cold
to
make
them
somewhat
chill
and
the
fears
which
little
janey
ford
had
put
into
their
hearts
began
to
grow
greater
and
more
fixed
each
moment
when
kathleen
appeared
all
was
immediately
changed
susy
preceded
her
carrying
the
little
paraffin
lamp
this
was
placed
on
the
table
which
was
arranged
in
the
yard
for
the
purpose
and
its
light
fell
now
on
the
vivid
coloring
and
beautiful
face
of
the
irish
girl
she
took
off
her
favorite
blue
velvet
cap
and
pushed
her
hand
through
her
masses
of
radiant
hair
and
then
flung
herself
into
what
she
was
pleased
to
call
an
attitude
but
which
was
really
a
very
graceful
and
natural
pose
then
she
said
speaking
aloud
girls
of
the
society
wild
irish
girls
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
that
my
aunt
miss
miss
katie
who
i
hoped
would
have
joined
our
numbers
and
would
have
been
a
perfect
rock
of
strength
for
us
all
has
been
obliged
to
suddenly
go
back
to
ireland
owing
to
an
accident
that
has
happened
to
her
dearest
friend
dear
dear
how
sad
said
one
or
two
so
we
are
without
her
girls
continued
kathleen
and
now
i
want
to
know
if
you
are
prepared
to
stand
by
me
through
thick
and
thin
that
we
are
was
shouted
in
one
vivid
clear
girlish
note
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
and
if
you
will
stand
by
me
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
i
will
stand
by
you
it
is
whispered
in
the
school
that
we
are
found
out
and
the
school
bless
it
is
angry
it
does
want
us
you
foundationers
and
me
to
have
our
fun
our
little
bit
of
innocent
fun
very
mean
of
it
said
one
or
two
while
the
others
groaned
it
wants
to
crush
us
continued
kathleen
we
mean
the
school
no
harm
and
why
should
it
let
us
alone
all
we
want
is
our
fun
a
little
bit
of
liberty
and
to
show
those
companions
who
look
down
upon
us
that
we
are
as
good
as
they
and
that
we
will
fight
for
each
other
and
have
our
own
way
and
meet
when
we
please
and
do
as
we
like
out
of
school
hours
it
is
a
sort
of
manifesto
of
independence
that
is
what
it
is
girls
and
i
want
to
know
if
you
will
stick
to
it
all
the
hands
were
raised
up
at
this
juncture
and
all
the
voices
said
yes
yes
yes
that
splendid
said
kathleen
i
did
know
i
had
such
an
enthusiastic
following
well
girls
we
have
to
run
a
certain
risk
we
will
have
to
conceal
all
we
can
about
this
society
we
have
to
be
true
to
each
other
whatever
happens
and
we
meet
wherever
we
like
girls
let
the
and
the
governors
say
what
they
please
hurrah
for
kathleen
hurrah
for
the
wild
irish
girls
for
ever
they
shouted
that
about
it
said
kathleen
i
called
you
all
to
tell
you
that
we
are
suspected
and
we
are
called
insurrectionists
but
let
them
call
us
what
they
like
please
here
put
in
the
timid
voice
of
janey
ford
are
we
likely
to
be
put
in
prison
for
that
would
break
mother
heart
and
do
none
of
us
any
good
oh
you
little
goose
cried
kathleen
with
her
ringing
laugh
not
a
bit
of
it
the
worst
that
could
happen
to
us
is
to
be
expelled
from
the
school
now
this
worst
which
was
really
a
matter
of
little
importance
in
the
eyes
of
kathleen
was
somewhat
serious
to
the
other
girls
to
be
expelled
meant
to
deprive
them
of
their
chance
of
being
well
educated
and
of
earning
a
decent
living
they
all
felt
very
grave
and
kathleen
who
had
a
great
power
of
reading
what
went
on
in
the
hearts
of
those
in
whom
she
was
interested
felt
somehow
that
their
enthusiasm
had
abated
but
nothing
will
happen
she
cried
if
we
are
faithful
to
each
other
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
do
not
whatever
happens
betray
each
other
why
girls
miss
ravenscroft
and
the
governors
can
do
nothing
to
us
unless
they
have
proof
and
they
will
have
no
proof
if
we
are
all
true
to
each
other
now
that
the
whole
of
it
for
we
meet
in
the
quarry
on
saturday
night
and
then
we
make
a
plan
for
a
great
expedition
all
by
ourselves
to
london
in
the
course
of
next
week
oh
dear
said
susy
does
it
make
your
heart
throb
and
i
want
to
add
continued
kathleen
that
i
will
frank
you
i
ca
do
it
always
but
i
will
on
this
occasion
aunt
katie
has
given
me
some
money
for
that
purpose
so
you
will
stick
to
me
wo
you
girls
that
we
will
came
from
the
mouths
of
all
and
i
am
your
captain
am
i
not
girls
indeed
you
are
we
could
die
for
you
said
one
or
two
and
never
betray
you
or
one
another
chapter
xxii
ruth
hard
choice
she
consults
her
grandfather
the
next
morning
cassandra
weldon
was
much
surprised
on
arriving
at
the
school
to
receive
a
message
asking
her
to
step
into
miss
special
sanctum
she
went
there
at
once
wondering
if
the
wanted
to
give
her
particular
instructions
with
regard
to
the
great
scholarship
examination
which
would
take
place
at
the
end
of
the
term
cassandra
was
remarkable
for
her
calm
and
somewhat
stately
bearing
she
was
the
sort
of
girl
who
never
gave
herself
away
she
was
admired
rather
than
passionately
loved
by
her
companions
no
one
could
help
giving
her
a
most
sincere
respect
but
one
or
two
adored
her
and
amongst
these
was
florence
archer
a
handsome
original
sort
of
girl
who
was
in
the
same
form
as
cassandra
be
sure
you
come
and
tell
me
afterwards
what
it
all
means
cassie
said
florence
touching
her
friend
affectionately
on
the
shoulder
cassandra
nodded
she
did
not
suppose
the
matter
was
of
special
import
the
rest
of
the
girls
proceeded
to
their
different
classes
and
cassandra
found
herself
in
miss
ravenscroft
presence
now
to
kathleen
the
fact
of
being
interviewed
by
miss
ravenscroft
only
caused
a
sense
of
annoyance
and
unwonted
irritation
ruth
was
surprised
partly
delighted
and
partly
afraid
but
cassandra
whose
father
had
been
a
teacher
and
who
lived
all
her
life
in
the
scholastic
world
considered
it
an
honor
almost
too
great
for
words
that
she
should
be
specially
interviewed
by
so
great
a
person
as
miss
ravenscroft
she
made
therefore
a
most
respectful
curtsy
and
stood
modestly
before
the
sit
down
dear
said
miss
ravenscroft
kindly
i
have
sent
for
you
cassandra
neither
to
reprove
nor
to
give
you
ordinary
counsel
i
have
sent
for
you
to
consult
you
my
dear
child
you
are
very
good
said
cassandra
flushing
all
over
her
delicate
face
and
i
am
sure
she
added
if
it
is
possible
for
me
to
help
one
like
you
i
should
be
only
too
proud
that
is
what
i
feel
and
i
think
you
can
help
me
we
are
at
present
in
a
very
unpleasant
position
in
the
school
the
unanimity
and
harmony
of
this
entire
large
place
is
in
danger
and
the
foundationers
are
in
extreme
peril
you
perhaps
know
to
what
i
allude
i
could
not
be
in
the
school
without
having
heard
rumors
of
a
sort
of
insurrection
which
seems
to
be
spreading
a
good
deal
said
cassandra
of
course
said
miss
ravenscroft
it
has
been
brought
to
our
ears
that
a
society
has
been
formed
by
an
irish
girl
of
the
name
of
kathleen
she
has
called
it
the
wild
irish
girls
there
are
several
members
and
she
herself
is
the
leader
now
cassandra
without
going
into
particulars
it
is
the
firm
intention
not
only
of
myself
as
but
also
of
the
governors
to
crush
this
matter
in
the
bud
it
is
true
that
the
bud
is
rapidly
blossoming
into
most
dangerous
flower
and
fruit
but
if
we
are
in
time
we
shall
stop
all
further
mischief
now
to
do
this
we
must
get
all
particulars
there
is
one
girl
who
can
furnish
us
will
all
we
want
to
know
but
she
dreads
doubtless
from
conscientious
motives
to
betray
her
late
companions
i
allude
to
ruth
craven
poor
little
ruth
said
cassandra
i
thought
as
much
the
child
is
very
unhappy
i
take
a
great
very
great
interest
in
ruth
miss
ravenscroft
she
is
a
most
sweet
girl
she
is
a
lady
placed
in
a
position
which
a
lady
should
scarcely
occupy
but
through
it
all
she
will
never
betray
the
true
instincts
of
her
nature
i
am
sure
of
that
i
quite
like
the
child
myself
said
miss
ravenscroft
and
your
opinion
of
her
cassie
confirms
my
own
she
told
me
too
that
you
have
been
extremely
kind
to
her
i
quite
expect
that
is
the
case
but
my
dear
the
time
has
come
when
ruth
will
either
have
to
tell
us
what
she
knows
or
to
resign
her
place
in
the
school
cassandra
face
looked
troubled
there
are
no
two
opinions
on
the
matter
continued
miss
ravenscroft
yesterday
a
meeting
of
the
governors
was
convened
they
assembled
in
the
and
i
was
present
ruth
was
sent
for
and
questioned
by
miss
mackenzie
our
chairwoman
she
was
asked
certain
questions
which
she
absolutely
refused
to
answer
the
only
thing
we
could
get
out
of
her
was
that
she
had
been
a
member
of
the
society
but
was
one
no
longer
she
left
them
because
of
me
said
cassandra
she
felt
she
could
not
be
with
me
and
with
those
who
do
not
approve
of
the
paying
girls
there
you
are
said
miss
ravenscroft
think
of
the
monstrous
mischief
that
is
going
on
in
our
midst
children
like
the
foundationers
who
are
received
at
the
school
without
being
expected
to
pay
anything
who
get
the
most
admirable
education
free
of
all
cost
daring
to
set
up
their
opinion
against
girls
who
without
being
in
any
sense
their
superiors
one
does
want
to
imply
that
for
an
instant
are
yet
vastly
superior
in
numbers
the
thing
must
be
put
a
stop
to
and
with
a
high
hand
and
to
show
you
my
dear
what
we
mean
to
do
we
have
presented
an
ultimatum
to
ruth
craven
she
will
either
tell
publicly
what
she
knows
of
the
wild
irish
girls
or
be
publicly
expelled
oh
poor
ruth
said
cassandra
we
are
naturally
most
anxious
that
such
a
painful
scene
should
not
take
place
said
miss
ravenscroft
i
beg
of
you
therefore
cassie
to
see
her
and
use
your
influence
to
induce
her
not
from
quixotic
motives
to
ruin
herself
and
injure
the
other
girls
of
the
school
i
will
do
what
i
can
but
ruth
is
peculiar
she
is
with
all
her
sweetness
very
obstinate
still
i
faithfully
promise
to
do
what
i
can
cassandra
left
the
presence
of
miss
ravenscroft
and
returned
to
her
place
in
class
nothing
would
induce
her
not
to
work
with
her
usual
diligence
but
when
on
certain
occasions
she
raised
her
head
she
saw
that
florence
archer
was
watching
her
with
curiosity
and
affection
and
that
ruth
darted
quick
glances
at
her
and
then
bent
her
head
with
its
curly
hair
falling
over
her
face
to
resume
her
lessons
this
was
a
and
the
classes
broke
up
at
twelve
cassandra
hoped
to
have
a
talk
with
ruth
before
she
went
home
but
when
she
looked
round
for
her
little
favorite
she
could
not
find
her
anywhere
the
foundationers
were
standing
in
knots
talking
eagerly
to
each
other
there
was
a
sort
of
buzz
or
whisper
going
on
in
their
midst
kathleen
darted
from
one
group
to
another
smiled
at
one
set
of
girls
patted
the
shoulder
of
a
favorite
girl
in
another
group
laughed
one
time
said
an
emphatic
word
to
another
and
presently
disappeared
accompanied
by
susy
hopkins
alice
tennant
was
standing
by
herself
she
looked
dull
and
depressed
cassandra
went
up
to
her
it
there
anything
the
matter
alice
she
asked
matter
replied
alice
surely
you
must
know
that
for
yourself
have
you
not
heard
what
a
condition
the
school
is
in
i
have
of
course
heard
about
the
wild
irish
girls
said
cassandra
lowering
her
voice
but
surely
the
fact
that
there
are
a
few
naughty
girls
in
our
midst
need
not
upset
the
whole
school
it
upsets
me
anyhow
said
alice
for
i
feel
that
i
have
brought
it
on
the
school
i
could
cry
i
only
wish
that
mother
had
never
been
induced
to
take
kathleen
as
a
boarder
she
is
worse
than
troublesome
she
is
a
girl
without
principle
oh
i
do
think
quite
so
bad
as
that
dear
said
a
gay
voice
at
that
moment
and
turning
alice
saw
the
piquant
and
beautiful
face
of
the
girl
she
loathed
i
guessed
of
course
that
you
must
be
alluding
to
me
said
kathleen
i
am
bad
but
i
have
my
own
principles
and
a
good
set
worth
a
great
deal
she
nodded
impertinently
to
both
the
girls
and
then
reentered
the
school
i
left
my
satchel
and
came
back
for
it
she
said
as
she
vanished
from
their
view
yes
said
alice
that
is
just
like
her
just
the
sort
of
thing
she
would
do
she
is
always
daring
every
one
i
do
wish
some
strong
influence
could
be
brought
to
bear
on
her
there
is
no
doubt
she
is
very
clever
and
when
she
likes
she
can
be
extremely
agreeable
she
is
extremely
pretty
you
know
and
that
goes
a
long
way
not
with
me
thank
goodness
said
alice
in
fact
i
almost
hate
her
face
i
detest
people
who
are
always
grinning
and
smiling
and
showing
themselves
off
my
opinion
is
that
schoolgirls
ought
to
be
modest
and
attentive
to
their
books
and
not
thinking
of
giving
themselves
airs
but
there
no
one
agrees
with
me
mother
and
the
boys
are
fairly
mad
on
kathleen
and
as
to
the
servants
there
nothing
they
would
do
for
her
every
one
combines
to
spoil
her
i
do
see
that
she
has
the
least
chance
cassandra
talked
a
little
longer
to
alice
and
then
prepared
to
go
home
she
was
disappointed
that
she
had
not
seen
ruth
but
ruth
had
promised
to
be
with
her
quite
early
in
the
afternoon
they
were
both
to
work
for
two
hours
and
afterwards
their
coach
was
to
arrive
ruth
would
spend
the
entire
afternoon
at
cassandra
home
on
her
way
back
florence
archer
suddenly
joined
her
now
cassie
she
said
what
is
it
oh
ca
you
guess
for
yourself
flo
it
is
this
the
school
has
got
into
trouble
and
the
governors
and
miss
ravenscroft
mean
to
sift
the
matter
to
the
very
bottom
it
is
pretty
bad
when
all
things
are
considered
for
if
the
girls
wo
tell
they
will
be
expelled
expelled
without
any
hope
of
returning
and
i
rather
fancy
kathleen
is
the
sort
of
girl
whom
no
one
will
betray
it
is
extremely
awkward
and
i
feel
very
miserable
about
it
you
look
it
and
yet
it
is
your
affair
your
place
in
the
school
is
secure
enough
what
does
that
matter
flo
when
those
you
love
are
in
danger
those
you
love
in
danger
cassie
what
do
you
mean
now
i
mean
just
what
i
say
i
am
decidedly
fond
of
little
ruth
craven
she
is
placed
in
a
hard
position
but
she
is
so
clever
and
so
pretty
that
she
could
do
anything
well
i
am
certain
that
ruth
wo
betray
her
companions
i
forgot
said
florence
that
she
did
belong
to
that
silly
society
what
a
little
goose
she
was
she
was
led
into
it
by
kathleen
they
all
were
for
that
matter
kathleen
seems
to
have
a
singular
power
over
them
but
ruth
does
belong
to
it
now
no
i
ca
in
justice
to
her
explain
any
further
florence
i
will
tell
you
all
i
can
of
course
but
may
i
say
now
for
i
have
a
good
deal
to
do
before
dinner
you
are
not
half
as
friendly
as
you
used
to
be
said
florence
pouting
you
hardly
ever
ask
me
to
your
house
and
when
i
ask
you
to
mine
you
always
have
an
excuse
ready
it
is
somewhat
hard
on
me
that
ruth
craven
should
have
come
between
us
but
she
has
i
wish
that
you
would
believe
that
she
has
i
have
to
give
her
a
sort
of
protecting
love
but
you
and
i
flo
are
equal
in
our
love
surely
we
can
afford
to
be
kind
to
a
little
girl
who
has
not
our
advantages
oh
if
you
put
it
in
that
way
i
do
mind
a
bit
said
florence
cheerfully
well
for
the
present
we
meet
morning
the
girls
parted
and
florence
went
on
her
way
home
meanwhile
ruth
had
also
gone
on
her
way
she
walked
slowly
once
or
twice
she
stopped
once
when
in
a
somewhat
narrow
and
lonely
path
she
paused
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
then
down
at
the
ground
beneath
her
feet
once
she
uttered
a
short
expressive
sort
of
sigh
and
once
she
said
i
do
hope
god
will
help
me
i
do
want
to
do
just
what
is
right
thus
lagging
as
she
walked
she
by
slow
degrees
reached
her
home
craven
happened
to
be
out
but
old
craven
was
seated
by
the
fire
he
was
feeling
rather
poorly
he
had
a
large
open
in
front
of
him
and
when
ruth
entered
he
laid
down
the
pen
with
which
he
had
been
summing
up
his
figures
i
ca
make
them
quite
right
he
said
slowly
why
grandfather
what
is
the
matter
said
ruth
in
some
surprise
the
old
man
large
clear
blue
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
child
i
had
a
curious
feeling
this
morning
he
said
but
i
know
now
it
was
only
a
dream
i
thought
i
was
back
in
the
shop
again
i
was
up
my
dear
i
had
taken
a
bit
of
a
walk
and
i
came
in
and
sat
down
by
the
fire
it
came
over
me
all
of
a
sudden
how
lazy
i
was
and
how
wrong
to
neglect
the
shop
and
not
give
your
grandmother
a
bit
of
help
with
the
customers
and
so
strong
was
the
notion
over
me
that
i
unlocked
the
old
bureau
and
took
out
the
i
said
to
myself
i
can
at
least
square
everything
up
for
her
and
that
will
help
her
as
much
as
anything
she
was
always
a
rare
one
to
see
a
good
balance
at
the
end
of
the
week
if
she
had
a
good
balance
and
all
things
nicely
squared
up
we
have
a
nice
little
joint
for
sunday
and
she
put
on
her
little
bonnet
and
best
mantle
and
we
go
for
a
walk
in
the
country
just
like
the
darby
and
joan
we
were
ruthie
and
which
we
are
but
if
the
balance
did
come
out
on
the
right
side
she
stay
at
home
she
never
cry
or
despair
that
was
her
way
bless
you
she
say
must
think
of
some
way
of
saving
john
or
we
must
do
a
bit
more
selling
of
the
stock
she
was
a
rare
one
to
contrive
ruth
had
heard
this
story
of
her
grandmother
many
and
many
a
time
before
but
her
grandfather
look
frightened
her
she
went
up
to
him
and
closed
the
big
you
have
balanced
things
a
long
time
ago
she
said
do
fret
now
may
i
put
the
aside
you
may
darling
you
may
but
the
accounts
ai
balanced
ruthie
we
are
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
ledger
my
love
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
ledger
ruth
said
nothing
more
she
put
the
book
back
into
the
drawer
and
locked
it
then
she
sat
down
by
her
grandfather
side
would
you
rather
i
got
you
your
dinner
she
said
or
would
you
rather
i
talked
to
you
for
a
little
i
a
sight
rather
my
little
ruth
sat
near
me
and
let
me
place
my
hand
on
her
hair
your
hair
is
ruthie
almost
so
was
your
father
hair
my
child
he
was
a
very
handsome
boy
i
never
looked
for
it
that
he
would
die
in
the
foreign
parts
and
leave
you
to
your
grandmother
and
me
but
you
have
been
a
rare
blessing
to
us
a
rare
blessing
sometimes
i
think
said
ruth
slowly
that
i
have
been
a
great
care
it
must
have
cost
you
a
great
deal
to
feed
and
clothe
me
no
no
child
far
from
that
you
were
always
the
bit
of
good
luck
on
the
right
side
of
the
balance
always
always
ruth
took
the
old
man
hand
and
pressed
it
between
both
her
own
presently
she
rubbed
her
cheeks
softly
against
it
grandfather
she
said
are
you
all
right
now
quite
wide
awake
i
mean
has
the
dream
about
the
shop
and
the
wrong
accounts
passed
out
of
your
head
why
yes
darling
of
course
it
was
only
a
dream
then
i
like
to
ask
you
something
ask
away
my
little
ruth
you
are
such
a
busy
little
maid
now
what
with
your
school
and
what
with
your
lessons
and
what
with
that
big
scholarship
sixty
pounds
a
year
ah
we
shall
have
a
fine
right
side
of
the
ledger
when
little
ruth
has
brought
home
sixty
pounds
a
year
ruth
stifled
a
groan
i
am
rather
puzzled
she
said
and
i
want
to
put
a
question
to
you
yes
my
darling
i
am
prepared
to
listen
i
know
a
girl
said
ruth
after
a
pause
she
thought
that
she
would
tell
her
story
that
way
i
know
a
girl
at
school
and
she
has
been
kindly
treated
she
is
one
of
the
foundation
girls
but
some
of
the
girls
who
are
not
foundationers
have
singled
her
out
and
been
specially
good
to
her
eh
eh
well
that
good
of
them
said
old
craven
they
have
been
very
good
to
her
but
that
irish
girl
whom
i
told
you
about
she
started
a
society
no
special
harm
in
itself
at
least
it
did
seem
harm
to
the
girl
i
have
been
telling
you
about
and
she
joined
it
she
joined
it
for
a
bit
and
she
liked
it
that
is
on
the
whole
but
afterwards
a
girl
who
had
not
joined
the
society
and
did
not
belong
to
the
foundationers
one
whom
i
am
sorry
to
say
the
foundationers
did
not
care
for
at
all
offered
a
great
kindness
to
this
girl
a
very
special
and
tremendous
kindness
and
the
girl
in
her
own
mind
decided
that
she
would
be
doing
wrong
not
to
accept
it
so
she
did
accept
it
and
are
you
listening
grandfather
indeed
i
am
little
maid
go
on
my
child
i
attending
to
every
word
the
girl
decided
to
accept
the
kindness
from
the
paying
girl
and
to
do
that
she
had
to
give
up
the
society
she
was
sorry
to
give
it
up
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
the
only
right
and
honorable
thing
to
do
she
could
not
belong
to
both
to
one
side
of
the
school
and
to
the
other
she
must
take
her
stand
with
one
or
the
other
so
she
decided
for
her
own
special
benefit
to
take
her
stand
with
the
paying
girls
on
the
whole
perhaps
she
was
right
said
the
old
man
ca
say
unless
i
know
everything
but
on
the
whole
perhaps
she
was
right
i
think
she
was
grandfather
said
ruth
slowly
but
now
please
listen
the
at
the
school
and
the
governors
have
found
out
about
the
secret
society
they
have
found
out
that
it
exists
but
they
do
know
much
more
they
know
however
that
its
influence
is
bad
in
the
school
and
they
are
determined
to
crush
it
out
in
order
to
do
this
they
must
get
full
particulars
they
must
get
the
name
of
the
leader
i
am
afraid
that
they
know
the
name
of
the
leader
but
they
must
also
get
the
names
of
her
companions
all
the
names
and
as
much
as
possible
of
the
rules
of
the
society
now
the
only
girl
not
a
member
of
the
society
who
can
give
those
particulars
is
the
girl
i
have
been
talking
about
for
of
course
she
knows
as
she
belonged
to
it
at
one
time
although
she
has
now
left
it
and
the
governors
and
the
sent
for
this
girl
and
asked
her
to
betray
her
companions
those
girls
to
whom
she
had
sworn
fealty
and
the
girl
refused
quite
right
said
old
craven
the
color
rushed
into
ruth
cheeks
she
clasped
her
grandfather
hand
firmly
she
thought
it
right
but
something
dreadful
is
going
to
happen
it
will
be
terribly
hard
for
the
girl
if
she
sticks
to
her
resolve
for
the
governors
of
the
school
have
presented
what
they
call
an
ultimatum
to
her
they
have
given
her
from
now
till
saturday
to
make
up
her
mind
and
if
she
refuses
on
saturday
grandfather
she
is
to
be
expelled
publicly
her
sentence
will
be
proclaimed
in
the
presence
of
all
the
school
and
she
will
be
watched
walking
out
of
the
schoolroom
and
out
of
the
big
gates
which
will
close
behind
her
for
ever
and
all
her
chance
goes
all
her
golden
prospects
nevertheless
grandfather
speaking
to
me
from
your
own
heart
ought
the
girl
to
betray
her
companions
upon
my
word
said
the
old
man
who
was
intensely
moved
by
story
it
did
not
occur
to
him
for
one
moment
that
the
little
girl
was
talking
about
herself
i
tell
you
what
ruth
he
said
i
must
think
over
it
i
pity
that
poor
girl
i
do
think
the
governors
ought
to
put
any
girl
in
such
a
position
they
are
sorry
but
they
say
they
must
they
must
get
at
the
truth
they
must
crush
out
the
insurrection
but
it
is
turning
king
evidence
said
the
old
man
i
do
see
how
a
girl
is
to
be
expected
to
betray
her
companions
that
is
the
position
grandfather
and
now
i
think
i
will
get
you
your
dinner
ruth
went
out
of
the
room
into
the
little
kitchen
for
a
minute
she
pressed
her
hands
against
her
face
grandfather
agrees
with
me
she
said
to
herself
i
am
glad
i
consulted
him
no
one
ever
had
a
clearer
head
for
business
or
for
right
and
wrong
than
grandfather
when
he
is
at
his
best
he
was
at
his
best
just
now
i
feel
stronger
i
wo
betray
kathleen
chapter
xxiii
ruth
will
not
betray
kathleen
soon
after
dinner
ruth
walked
over
to
cassandra
house
cassandra
was
so
anxious
to
see
her
so
determined
to
use
her
influence
on
what
she
considered
the
scale
of
right
that
she
was
waiting
for
ruth
at
the
little
gate
ah
here
you
are
she
said
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
mother
has
gone
out
for
the
day
we
will
have
a
whole
delightful
afternoon
to
ourselves
we
can
do
some
good
work
let
us
said
ruth
she
felt
feverish
and
excited
as
a
rule
she
was
very
calm
but
now
her
heart
beat
too
fast
she
was
thinking
of
her
grandfather
and
of
what
it
would
mean
to
him
and
the
old
grandmother
when
she
came
back
on
saturday
a
disgraced
girl
expelled
from
her
high
estate
her
golden
chance
snatched
from
her
nevertheless
she
had
always
been
pretty
firm
and
pretty
well
resolved
to
do
what
she
thought
right
she
was
firmer
now
and
quite
resolved
shall
we
go
in
at
once
and
set
to
work
she
said
i
want
to
read
that
bit
of
tasso
over
again
before
miss
renshaw
comes
no
no
said
cassandra
you
are
always
in
such
a
fidget
to
learn
ruth
come
into
the
garden
i
want
to
talk
to
you
ruth
looked
full
round
at
her
companion
she
saw
something
in
cassandra
eye
which
made
her
slightly
shiver
then
she
said
very
well
cassandra
opened
the
little
gate
which
led
into
the
tiny
fruit
and
vegetable
garden
there
was
a
narrow
path
bordered
on
each
side
with
a
down
which
the
girls
walked
presently
cassandra
slipped
her
arm
round
ruth
waist
you
knew
of
course
she
said
how
much
i
love
you
you
are
awfully
good
to
me
cassie
as
a
rule
i
am
not
fond
of
what
schoolgirls
call
falling
in
love
continued
cassandra
but
i
love
you
there
is
nothing
i
would
do
for
you
thank
you
said
ruth
again
she
wondered
what
cassandra
would
say
on
saturday
surely
after
saturday
no
girl
who
belonged
to
the
great
shirley
school
would
like
to
speak
to
her
now
i
want
to
tell
you
something
continued
cassandra
i
saw
miss
ravenscroft
this
morning
she
told
me
about
you
and
your
position
with
the
governors
oh
need
we
talk
of
that
said
ruth
coloring
stopping
in
her
walk
and
turning
to
face
cassandra
why
should
we
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
everything
why
are
you
going
to
be
so
obstinate
but
of
course
you
wo
be
you
will
you
must
change
your
mind
she
told
me
miss
ravenscroft
did
because
she
likes
you
ruth
and
she
would
be
so
terribly
sorry
if
you
got
into
trouble
over
this
matter
she
said
you
are
certain
to
get
into
most
serious
terrible
trouble
for
the
governors
will
on
no
account
depart
from
their
firm
resolve
to
expel
you
from
the
school
you
will
have
defied
their
authority
and
that
is
what
they
can
not
permit
it
is
on
that
ground
they
will
expel
you
but
it
is
strong
enough
no
one
can
suppose
for
a
moment
that
they
are
acting
with
injustice
i
am
glad
it
is
on
that
ground
said
ruth
softly
then
of
course
you
will
be
wise
ruth
it
is
silly
and
quixotic
for
the
sake
of
a
girl
like
kathleen
to
ruin
all
your
own
prospects
it
is
scarcely
that
and
yet
it
is
that
said
ruth
slowly
it
is
because
i
will
not
be
a
traitor
she
added
lowering
her
voice
then
flinging
up
her
head
and
gazing
proudly
before
her
i
knew
you
were
quixotic
i
knew
that
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
said
cassandra
but
you
will
think
it
over
ruth
it
would
be
too
terrible
to
see
you
denounced
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
school
and
sent
out
of
the
school
for
ever
think
of
losing
your
scholarship
think
of
the
help
you
want
to
give
your
grandparents
think
of
your
own
future
i
think
of
them
all
said
ruth
but
i
also
think
of
what
father
would
have
said
if
he
were
alive
you
see
cassandra
before
all
things
he
was
a
gentleman
cassandra
started
she
looked
full
at
ruth
is
that
a
slap
at
me
she
asked
no
i
did
not
mean
it
as
a
slap
at
you
or
anybody
i
only
see
how
the
matter
looks
to
me
and
how
it
would
have
looked
to
father
and
how
it
looks
to
grandfather
there
are
some
people
born
that
way
i
think
after
a
fashion
i
am
one
of
them
there
are
others
who
would
look
at
the
thing
from
a
different
point
of
view
but
i
do
think
i
envy
those
others
shall
we
go
in
now
and
set
to
work
you
are
an
extraordinary
girl
said
cassandra
i
really
do
know
whether
i
love
you
or
hate
you
most
for
being
such
a
little
goose
well
ruth
if
that
is
your
mind
i
do
know
why
you
care
to
go
in
to
work
for
it
will
be
all
over
in
a
day
or
two
all
over
and
your
fate
sealed
nevertheless
i
should
like
to
read
that
piece
of
tasso
and
do
my
work
with
miss
renshaw
shall
we
go
in
said
ruth
cassandra
somehow
did
not
dare
to
say
any
more
afterwards
when
ruth
had
returned
to
her
own
home
cassandra
sat
with
her
head
in
her
hands
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
her
mother
asked
her
what
ailed
her
i
have
a
headache
she
replied
i
was
with
a
girl
who
is
fifty
times
too
good
for
me
what
nonsense
you
are
talking
cassandra
there
are
few
people
good
enough
for
you
to
think
of
her
gives
me
a
headache
continued
cassandra
if
you
do
mind
mother
i
will
go
to
bed
now
meanwhile
things
were
moving
rather
rapidly
in
another
direction
kathleen
walking
home
that
day
in
the
company
of
susy
hopkins
eagerly
questioned
that
young
lady
how
prim
and
proper
every
one
looked
in
the
school
she
said
what
is
wrong
there
is
plenty
wrong
said
susy
i
tell
you
what
it
is
kathleen
i
feel
rather
frightened
i
suppose
it
will
come
to
our
all
being
expelled
oh
not
a
bit
of
it
said
kathleen
well
it
looks
rather
like
it
said
susy
do
you
know
what
they
are
doing
what
they
are
bringing
pressure
to
bear
upon
ruth
craven
the
governors
convened
a
special
meeting
yesterday
they
had
ruth
before
them
and
then
tried
by
every
means
in
their
power
to
get
her
to
tell
you
see
she
is
in
the
position
of
the
person
who
knows
everything
she
belonged
to
us
for
a
time
and
now
she
does
belong
to
us
well
said
kathleen
feeling
interested
and
a
little
startled
she
would
tell
of
course
she
would
she
is
a
brick
the
ruth
cravens
of
the
world
are
not
traitors
said
kathleen
and
so
that
is
what
the
governors
are
doing
horrid
sneaky
disagreeable
things
but
they
are
not
going
to
subdue
me
so
they
need
think
it
i
tell
you
what
it
is
susy
why
should
we
put
off
till
next
week
our
picnic
to
town
ca
we
have
it
this
week
i
wish
we
could
said
susy
it
would
be
glorious
she
continued
i
do
think
somehow
kathleen
that
they
will
catch
us
in
the
long
run
it
might
be
dangerous
to
put
off
our
glorious
time
till
next
week
it
might
it
certainly
would
said
kathleen
we
will
go
evening
school
is
always
over
at
four
we
can
meet
at
the
railway
station
between
five
and
six
and
go
off
all
by
ourselves
to
but
where
shall
we
go
when
we
get
to
town
could
we
go
to
a
theatre
to
the
pit
at
one
of
the
theatres
if
only
aunt
katie
was
with
us
it
would
be
as
right
as
right
said
kathleen
but
dare
we
go
alone
i
am
sure
we
dare
i
should
be
frightened
i
think
some
of
the
girls
know
exactly
how
to
manage
well
i
tell
you
what
you
know
most
of
the
names
of
the
members
go
round
and
see
as
many
as
you
can
tell
them
that
i
am
game
for
a
real
bit
of
fun
and
that
i
will
stand
treat
we
will
go
to
town
by
the
train
evening
we
will
have
some
refreshments
at
a
restaurant
and
then
we
will
go
to
the
pit
of
one
of
the
theatres
it
will
be
a
lark
there
will
be
about
forty
of
us
altogether
we
are
sure
to
be
found
out
it
is
too
risky
and
yet
i
think
we
do
it
said
susy
oh
there
never
was
such
a
lark
nothing
could
happen
to
forty
of
us
said
kathleen
i
am
going
to
do
it
just
to
defy
them
how
dare
they
try
to
make
dear
little
ruth
betray
us
but
she
wo
i
am
certain
she
wo
susy
talked
a
little
longer
to
kathleen
and
finally
agreed
to
take
her
message
to
as
many
of
the
wild
irish
girls
as
she
could
possibly
reach
they
will
all
hear
of
it
safe
enough
said
susy
the
whole
forty
of
us
will
meet
you
at
the
station
night
oh
dear
of
course
it
is
wrong
it
is
magnificently
wrong
that
is
the
glorious
part
of
it
said
kathleen
oh
dear
i
feel
almost
as
jolly
as
though
i
were
in
old
ireland
again
she
laughed
merrily
parted
from
susy
and
ran
all
the
rest
of
the
way
home
chapter
xxiv
kathleen
and
grandfather
craven
friday
was
emphatically
a
summer
day
in
winter
the
sky
was
cloudless
the
few
leaves
that
still
remained
on
the
trees
looked
brilliant
in
their
autumn
coloring
the
ground
was
crisp
under
foot
the
air
was
soft
gentle
and
pleasant
girls
like
all
other
creatures
are
susceptible
to
weather
they
do
their
best
work
and
have
their
best
feelings
aroused
when
the
sun
shines
and
the
day
looks
cheerful
the
sunshiny
weather
puts
heart
into
them
but
it
is
sad
to
relate
that
when
a
girl
is
bent
on
mischief
she
is
even
more
mischievous
more
daring
more
defiant
when
the
sun
shines
and
the
earth
looks
gay
kathleen
awoke
on
the
special
morning
after
a
night
of
wild
dreams
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
and
looked
across
at
alice
what
a
lovely
day
why
i
see
sunshine
quite
plainly
from
where
i
am
lying
wake
up
wo
you
alice
she
said
how
tiresome
of
you
to
rouse
me
said
alice
opening
her
eyes
and
looking
crossly
at
kathleen
kathleen
smiled
back
at
her
her
face
was
rosy
her
hair
was
tossed
in
wild
confusion
about
her
head
and
shoulders
it
tumbled
also
over
her
forehead
and
made
her
eyes
look
more
dancing
and
mischievous
than
ever
beneath
its
heavy
shadow
i
wonder
said
kathleen
softly
if
she
had
spoken
in
a
loud
voice
alice
would
have
taken
no
notice
but
there
was
something
pathetic
and
beautiful
in
her
tone
and
alice
raised
herself
and
looked
at
her
i
wonder
she
said
why
you
hate
me
so
much
fudge
said
alice
but
alice
it
is
fudge
why
should
i
have
made
myself
so
terribly
obnoxious
to
you
the
others
are
fond
of
me
they
do
think
me
perfect
and
indeed
i
do
want
them
to
but
they
love
me
for
those
qualities
in
me
which
are
worthy
of
love
how
you
chatter
said
alice
i
have
hitherto
failed
to
perceive
the
qualities
in
you
that
are
worthy
of
love
it
wants
another
quarter
of
an
hour
before
our
hot
water
is
brought
in
do
you
greatly
object
to
my
sleeping
during
that
time
no
cross
patch
said
kathleen
turning
angrily
on
her
pillow
you
may
sleep
till
doomsday
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
polite
muttered
alice
she
shut
her
eyes
folded
her
arms
and
prepared
for
further
slumber
but
somehow
kathleen
had
effectually
aroused
her
she
could
not
get
the
radiant
face
out
of
her
head
nor
the
words
a
little
sad
in
their
meaning
out
of
her
ears
she
looked
up
as
though
moved
to
say
something
as
you
have
asked
me
a
question
i
will
give
you
an
answer
i
know
a
way
in
which
you
can
secure
my
good
opinion
really
said
kathleen
who
was
too
angry
now
to
be
properly
polite
and
what
may
that
way
be
why
this
if
you
will
tell
the
truth
about
your
horrible
society
and
spare
dear
little
ruth
craven
and
make
cassandra
weldon
happy
i
do
care
twopence
about
your
tiresome
cassandra
but
little
ruth
what
ails
her
the
governors
are
going
to
insist
upon
her
telling
what
she
knows
but
she
wo
said
kathleen
laughing
merrily
she
is
too
much
of
a
brick
then
she
be
expelled
what
nonsense
you
wait
and
see
you
do
know
the
great
shirley
school
as
well
as
i
do
however
i
have
spoken
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
it
is
time
to
get
up
after
all
the
girls
dressed
in
silence
alice
had
long
ceased
to
torment
kathleen
about
her
own
side
of
the
room
provided
alice
side
was
left
in
peace
she
determined
to
shut
her
eyes
to
untidy
wardrobes
to
the
chest
of
drawers
full
to
bursting
to
a
boot
kicked
off
here
and
a
shoe
disporting
itself
there
to
ribbons
and
laces
and
handkerchiefs
and
scarves
and
blouses
scattered
on
the
bed
and
even
on
the
floor
alice
had
learnt
to
put
up
with
these
things
she
turned
her
back
on
them
so
to
speak
the
two
girls
ran
downstairs
together
just
for
a
moment
kathleen
had
felt
frightened
at
alice
words
but
then
she
cast
them
from
her
mind
it
was
quite
quite
impossible
to
suppose
that
anything
so
monstrously
unfair
as
that
a
little
girl
should
be
expelled
from
the
school
could
happen
ruth
too
of
all
the
girls
ruth
who
was
absolutely
goodness
itself
so
kathleen
ate
her
breakfast
with
appetite
remarked
on
the
brightness
of
the
day
to
tennant
and
the
boys
and
then
with
alice
started
off
to
school
with
her
satchel
of
books
slung
over
her
shoulder
her
gay
pretty
dress
making
her
look
a
most
remarkable
figure
amongst
all
the
girls
who
were
going
towards
the
great
school
and
her
saucy
bright
face
attracting
attention
on
all
sides
there
was
nothing
about
kathleen
to
indicate
that
that
evening
she
meant
to
steal
from
home
and
in
company
with
forty
companions
go
to
london
she
was
able
to
keep
her
own
counsel
and
this
last
daring
scheme
was
locked
tightly
up
in
her
heart
on
her
way
to
school
she
met
ruth
there
is
ruth
she
said
turning
to
alice
oh
and
there
susy
in
the
distance
i
want
to
speak
to
them
both
you
can
go
on
of
course
alice
i
will
follow
presently
we
are
rather
late
as
it
is
said
alice
in
addition
to
your
misdemeanors
i
should
advise
you
not
to
be
late
for
prayers
just
at
present
thanks
so
much
said
kathleen
in
a
sarcastic
tone
she
left
alice
and
ran
towards
ruth
why
ruth
she
said
you
do
look
pale
oh
i
am
all
right
said
ruth
brightening
at
the
sight
of
kathleen
then
you
do
look
it
ruth
is
it
true
that
they
want
you
to
tell
they
want
me
to
kathleen
said
ruth
but
i
am
not
going
to
you
can
rest
quite
satisfied
on
that
point
you
are
a
splendid
darling
brick
said
kathleen
and
i
love
you
to
distraction
dear
ruth
what
can
i
do
for
you
give
up
the
society
as
fast
as
you
can
said
ruth
what
and
yet
you
wo
tell
it
because
it
dishonorable
to
tell
said
ruth
do
keep
me
now
kathleen
i
want
to
get
into
school
in
good
time
grandfather
is
not
well
and
i
must
hurry
back
to
him
your
nice
grandfather
that
you
have
talked
to
me
about
he
was
ill
all
night
he
talked
about
you
a
little
do
you
know
kathleen
i
think
he
like
to
see
you
would
you
greatly
mind
coming
back
with
me
after
school
just
to
see
him
for
a
minute
i
have
told
him
so
much
about
you
and
i
have
told
granny
too
and
they
both
picture
you
somewhat
as
you
are
do
you
think
you
could
come
just
to
give
them
both
pleasure
come
said
kathleen
gaily
why
of
course
i
come
heart
of
my
life
i
do
anything
on
earth
to
please
you
i
join
you
after
school
and
well
go
straight
away
it
does
matter
a
bit
about
my
being
late
for
dinner
at
the
tennants
ah
there
susy
i
want
to
have
a
word
with
her
kathleen
pushed
past
ruth
and
ran
up
to
susy
susy
was
looking
intensely
agitated
there
were
vivid
spots
of
color
on
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
were
as
bright
as
stars
i
have
managed
everything
she
said
in
a
whisper
it
all
right
it
splendidly
right
we
are
all
coming
not
one
of
us
will
stay
behind
we
know
what
it
means
of
course
you
look
very
mysterious
said
kathleen
i
wonder
why
you
talk
like
that
what
does
it
mean
in
your
opinion
oh
kathleen
ca
you
understand
and
one
does
it
sometimes
in
life
i
have
read
about
it
in
and
there
are
cases
of
it
in
history
you
have
one
great
tremendous
fling
you
do
what
is
wrong
you
have
a
good
a
very
good
time
and
you
know
it
wo
last
you
know
that
afterwards
will
come
the
deluge
you
are
a
silly
said
kathleen
why
what
could
happen
nobody
need
know
we
will
be
far
too
careful
for
that
i
ca
tell
you
how
splendidly
i
have
planned
things
i
have
got
up
my
headache
already
in
order
to
go
to
my
room
and
thus
avoid
all
suspicion
oh
dear
said
susy
it
does
sound
right
does
it
right
or
wrong
it
is
fun
said
kathleen
i
am
going
to
have
it
so
i
have
got
the
money
and
i
mean
to
have
a
magnificent
time
now
keep
me
i
must
run
into
school
it
is
horrid
of
them
to
grudge
us
our
little
bit
of
amusement
susy
agreed
with
her
friend
indeed
during
those
days
she
was
nearly
lifted
off
her
feet
so
excited
was
she
so
charmed
so
altogether
amazed
at
kathleen
condescension
to
her
before
kathleen
arrived
at
the
school
susy
was
a
good
little
girl
who
helped
her
mother
in
the
shop
and
had
dreams
of
going
into
another
shop
herself
in
those
days
she
did
not
consider
herself
a
lady
nor
expect
ladies
to
take
any
special
notice
of
her
but
those
dull
and
stupid
days
were
no
more
gold
and
sunshine
and
rich
color
and
marvellous
dreams
had
all
come
into
her
life
since
the
arrival
of
kathleen
at
merrifield
for
kathleen
had
discrimination
it
mattered
nothing
to
her
whether
a
girl
paid
or
did
not
pay
for
her
lessons
whether
she
belonged
to
the
despised
foundationers
or
was
respected
and
looked
up
to
by
paying
girls
indeed
if
anything
kathleen
had
a
decided
leaning
towards
the
foundationers
and
she
kathleen
was
a
lady
she
belonged
to
what
her
mother
and
aunt
church
called
the
real
quality
none
of
your
upstarts
aunt
church
had
said
but
one
who
for
generations
has
belonged
to
the
aristocrats
and
they
are
of
the
kind
who
are
too
great
in
themselves
to
be
proud
they
are
proud
in
the
right
way
but
they
never
look
down
on
folks
yes
susy
was
a
happy
girl
now
but
after
all
was
she
quite
happy
was
she
not
at
this
very
minute
more
or
less
oppressed
by
a
secret
fear
suppose
any
single
individual
in
merrifield
heard
of
the
midnight
picnic
the
great
daring
midnight
excursion
into
the
heart
of
london
susy
knew
far
better
than
kathleen
what
a
mad
action
the
girls
were
about
to
perpetrate
she
knew
because
she
lived
with
the
class
who
discussed
such
things
very
openly
if
their
frolic
was
not
discovered
all
would
be
well
if
it
was
it
would
be
ruin
ruin
complete
and
absolute
the
ladies
of
the
town
would
fight
shy
of
her
mother
shop
aunt
church
would
be
very
unlikely
to
get
her
little
almshouse
in
ireland
for
surely
even
kathleen
friends
would
be
very
angry
with
her
if
they
knew
susy
herself
would
be
expelled
from
the
school
and
she
in
her
fall
would
bring
down
her
mother
and
brother
yes
terrible
would
be
the
consequences
they
were
discovered
but
then
they
need
be
plucky
people
were
not
as
a
rule
brought
into
trouble
of
that
sort
it
only
needed
a
brave
heart
and
a
firm
foot
and
courage
which
nothing
could
daunt
and
the
other
girls
the
who
were
to
join
kathleen
and
susy
would
keep
them
company
nevertheless
susy
was
as
unhappy
as
she
was
happy
that
day
she
was
so
absorbed
in
her
feelings
and
in
wondering
what
would
happen
during
the
next
hours
that
she
was
not
attentive
at
her
lessons
and
did
not
notice
how
the
teachers
watched
her
and
made
remarks
it
was
very
evident
to
an
onlooker
that
the
teachers
were
particularly
alert
that
morning
and
that
their
gaze
was
principally
fixed
upon
the
foundationers
no
remarks
however
were
made
the
school
came
to
an
end
quite
in
the
usual
manner
immediately
afterwards
kathleen
dashed
off
to
find
ruth
ruth
was
waiting
for
her
just
outside
the
gates
here
i
am
said
kathleen
take
my
arm
wo
you
ruthie
i
shall
be
very
glad
indeed
to
be
introduced
to
your
grandfather
ruth
made
no
answer
her
face
was
white
but
this
fact
only
increased
the
rare
delicacy
the
sort
of
fragrance
which
her
appearance
always
presented
kathleen
and
ruth
did
they
but
know
it
made
a
most
charming
contrast
as
they
walked
across
the
common
for
ruth
belonged
more
or
less
to
the
twilight
and
the
evening
star
and
kathleen
her
face
her
eyes
her
voice
her
actions
spoke
to
those
who
had
eyes
to
see
of
the
morning
kathleen
was
all
enthusiasm
gay
life
valor
daring
ruth
gentle
face
and
quiet
voice
gave
little
indication
of
the
real
depth
of
character
which
lay
beneath
this
is
such
a
lovely
day
said
kathleen
and
somehow
i
feel
so
downright
happy
perhaps
i
am
wrong
perhaps
i
am
right
but
i
feel
happy
i
think
it
is
on
account
of
the
day
they
had
now
reached
the
little
path
which
led
up
to
the
cottage
ruth
went
first
and
kathleen
followed
what
a
tiny
place
for
her
darling
favorite
to
live
in
but
kathleen
felt
she
loved
her
all
the
better
for
it
ruth
softly
unlatched
the
door
and
peeped
in
the
opened
right
into
the
kitchen
and
craven
was
seated
by
the
fire
hush
she
said
putting
her
finger
to
her
lips
he
is
asleep
i
have
brought
kathleen
granny
i
thought
you
like
to
see
her
and
i
thought
granddad
would
like
to
see
her
to
be
sure
child
said
craven
bustling
up
and
removing
her
bring
miss
in
at
once
is
she
waiting
outside
where
are
your
manners
ruth
ah
miss
i
right
pleased
to
see
you
i
am
sorry
my
dear
husband
is
not
as
well
as
could
be
wished
but
perhaps
if
you
be
good
enough
to
sit
down
for
a
minute
or
two
he
would
wake
up
before
you
go
kathleen
entered
held
out
her
hand
greeted
craven
with
a
frank
smile
showing
a
row
of
pearly
teeth
and
then
sat
down
near
the
fire
this
is
cosy
she
said
are
you
going
to
give
me
a
little
bit
of
dinner
mrs
craven
oh
my
dear
young
lady
but
we
live
so
plain
and
so
do
i
when
i
am
at
home
said
kathleen
i
do
hate
messy
dishes
i
like
potatoes
better
than
anything
in
the
world
often
at
home
i
go
off
with
my
boy
cousins
and
we
have
such
a
good
feed
i
think
potatoes
are
better
than
anything
in
the
world
well
miss
if
you
like
a
potato
it
at
your
service
i
should
if
it
is
in
its
jacket
what
did
you
say
miss
if
the
potato
is
boiled
in
its
jacket
ah
i
see
they
are
please
let
me
have
one
kathleen
did
not
wait
for
craven
reply
she
herself
fetched
a
plate
and
the
from
the
dresser
and
putting
these
on
the
table
helped
herself
to
a
potato
from
the
pot
now
she
said
this
is
good
i
can
fancy
i
am
back
in
old
ireland
craven
began
to
laugh
ruth
do
have
a
potato
with
me
said
kathleen
they
are
when
you
do
put
a
knife
or
fork
near
them
but
ruth
had
no
inclination
for
potatoes
eaten
in
the
irish
way
i
will
go
in
and
see
how
grandfather
is
granny
she
said
and
she
disappeared
into
the
little
parlor
you
know
said
kathleen
helping
herself
to
a
second
potato
and
fixing
her
eyes
on
craven
face
you
know
how
fond
i
am
of
ruth
indeed
my
dear
young
lady
she
has
been
telling
me
about
you
and
i
am
glad
you
notice
her
dear
little
girl
but
it
is
not
only
i
said
kathleen
every
one
in
the
school
likes
her
she
could
be
the
primest
favorite
with
every
one
if
she
only
chose
she
is
so
sweetly
pretty
too
and
such
a
lady
well
dear
her
mother
was
a
real
lady
and
her
father
was
educated
by
my
dear
husband
and
was
in
the
army
it
does
matter
if
her
father
was
a
duke
and
her
mother
a
dairymaid
said
kathleen
with
emphasis
she
is
just
a
lady
because
she
is
before
she
could
add
another
word
ruth
came
in
do
come
kathleen
she
said
he
is
much
better
after
his
sleep
i
told
him
you
were
here
and
he
would
like
to
see
you
he
has
been
bothered
like
anything
about
those
accounts
said
craven
i
ca
make
out
what
has
put
it
into
his
head
years
ago
it
was
an
old
story
with
him
that
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
books
but
dear
hearts
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
for
a
weary
long
while
now
within
the
last
week
he
has
been
at
it
again
just
as
if
was
yesterday
he
has
an
old
on
the
table
now
granny
said
ruth
well
said
craven
we
must
humor
do
you
take
any
notice
miss
do
contradict
him
i
mean
kathleen
nodded
there
was
a
look
on
ruth
face
which
made
her
feel
no
longer
interested
in
the
irish
potatoes
she
slipped
her
hand
inside
her
friend
and
they
went
into
the
parlor
craven
was
seated
by
the
fire
his
white
locks
fell
about
his
shoulders
there
was
a
faint
touch
of
pink
on
each
of
his
sallow
cheeks
and
his
blue
eyes
were
bright
ah
he
said
raising
his
face
when
he
saw
kathleen
and
is
this
the
little
lady
the
dear
little
lady
from
over
the
seas
from
the
heart
of
ireland
itself
i
was
once
in
ireland
i
spent
a
month
in
dublin
and
i
bought
the
very
best
paper
for
packing
my
sugars
and
teas
in
that
i
ever
came
across
ah
i
had
a
good
time
we
used
to
sit
in
phoenix
park
i
liked
ireland
and
i
could
welcome
any
irish
give
me
your
hand
missy
i
am
proud
to
see
you
kathleen
gave
her
hand
she
came
up
close
to
the
old
man
and
said
do
you
know
you
have
a
look
of
my
own
old
grandfather
he
is
dead
and
in
his
grave
but
he
had
white
white
hair
like
yours
do
you
mind
if
i
put
my
hand
on
your
hair
and
stroke
it
just
because
of
grandfather
ah
my
dear
you
may
do
what
you
like
said
the
old
man
and
you
have
been
good
to
my
little
lass
my
little
woman
here
she
has
told
me
you
have
been
good
to
her
she
has
been
very
good
to
me
i
am
glad
to
see
you
craven
i
hope
when
you
get
strong
again
you
will
come
over
and
stay
with
father
and
mother
and
me
at
carrigrohane
castle
no
no
my
love
there
was
a
time
when
i
have
liked
it
well
but
not
now
you
see
dear
his
voice
faltered
and
his
eyes
grew
anxious
i
must
mind
the
shop
when
a
man
does
attend
to
his
own
business
accounts
go
wrong
now
there
was
quite
a
deficiency
last
week
the
wrong
side
of
the
ledger
it
was
really
terrible
i
think
of
it
at
night
and
when
i
wake
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
remember
it
i
must
get
to
my
accounts
little
miss
but
i
am
right
glad
to
see
you
kathleen
felt
a
lump
in
her
throat
ruth
with
her
bright
eyes
fixed
on
her
grandfather
stood
close
by
but
there
said
the
old
man
hastily
it
splendid
for
ruth
got
into
that
school
and
she
trying
for
a
scholarship
i
know
what
ruth
tries
for
she
will
get
for
her
brain
is
of
that
fine
quality
that
could
not
brook
defeat
and
her
mind
is
of
that
high
order
that
it
must
adjust
itself
to
true
learning
i
was
a
bit
of
a
scholar
when
i
was
young
although
i
made
my
money
in
grocery
well
well
ruth
is
all
right
even
if
the
old
man
ca
square
up
the
ledger
ruth
is
as
right
as
right
can
be
thank
you
miss
i
ca
remember
your
name
but
thank
you
little
irish
miss
for
coming
to
see
me
and
kathleen
found
herself
outside
the
room
craven
was
not
in
the
kitchen
ruth
and
kathleen
went
into
the
garden
how
can
you
stand
it
said
kathleen
does
it
break
your
heart
to
see
him
oh
no
said
ruth
you
see
i
am
accustomed
to
him
he
talks
like
that
i
am
sorry
he
is
so
bothered
about
the
accounts
but
perhaps
that
phase
will
pass
he
is
so
pleased
about
you
and
the
scholarship
yes
said
ruth
she
turned
pale
whatever
happens
she
added
he
must
never
know
what
do
you
mean
about
whatever
happens
he
must
never
know
if
i
do
not
get
it
now
kathleen
i
am
glad
you
have
seen
grandfather
and
granny
i
must
go
back
to
granny
now
she
is
very
tired
she
gets
so
little
rest
at
night
kathleen
went
slowly
home
the
meal
was
over
at
the
tennants
but
somehow
her
couple
of
potatoes
had
satisfied
her
she
felt
much
more
sober
than
she
had
done
in
the
morning
she
was
inclined
to
think
to
consider
her
ways
she
felt
an
uncomfortable
sensation
of
being
haunted
by
the
faces
of
ruth
and
the
old
man
but
of
course
ruth
will
get
her
scholarship
she
said
to
herself
of
course
of
course
her
grandfather
is
right
her
brain
is
of
the
right
order
and
her
mind
is
attuned
to
learning
how
nicely
he
spoke
and
how
beautiful
he
looked
how
like
my
dear
old
grandfather
who
has
been
with
god
for
so
many
years
now
there
came
a
loud
at
the
david
went
out
and
brought
in
a
telegram
it
was
addressed
to
kathleen
she
opened
it
in
some
surprise
and
read
the
contents
slowly
there
was
amazement
on
her
face
a
feeling
of
consternation
stole
into
her
heart
the
telegram
not
a
long
one
was
from
her
father
have
just
seen
aunt
katie
do
not
approve
of
your
society
squash
the
whole
thing
at
once
or
expect
my
serious
is
there
an
answer
asked
david
no
said
kathleen
i
mean
yes
yes
i
suppose
so
can
i
have
a
form
tennant
can
i
have
a
telegraph
form
tennant
began
to
hunt
about
for
one
telegrams
were
by
no
means
common
things
at
the
tennants
house
david
suggested
that
the
messenger
boy
might
have
one
this
turned
out
to
be
the
case
kathleen
began
to
write
but
she
suddenly
changed
her
mind
no
no
there
is
no
answer
she
said
i
can
write
by
post
she
crushed
the
telegram
up
and
thrust
it
into
her
pocket
after
this
she
went
out
for
a
little
she
was
too
restless
to
stay
still
the
fascination
of
the
coming
sport
grew
greater
as
obstacles
appeared
in
the
way
of
its
realization
whatever
her
father
might
say
she
could
not
desert
the
girls
who
belonged
to
her
society
now
what
can
have
ailed
aunt
katie
to
betray
me
in
such
a
fashion
she
thought
she
came
home
in
time
for
tea
but
to
her
amazement
she
found
another
telegram
waiting
for
her
this
was
from
dublin
from
aunt
katie
herself
have
told
your
father
he
received
letter
from
this
morning
very
angry
about
wild
irish
girls
you
must
give
the
whole
thing
up
or
you
will
incur
his
serious
displeasure
do
be
a
goose
nip
the
thing
in
the
bud
aunt
katie
but
indeed
i
wo
thought
kathleen
whatever
happens
we
will
have
our
fun
whatever
happens
neither
father
nor
aunt
katie
nor
ruth
craven
can
keep
me
back
chapter
xxv
kathleen
has
a
good
time
in
london
so
the
had
written
she
had
dared
to
write
to
father
what
she
said
to
him
was
a
matter
of
no
moment
she
had
written
and
to
complain
of
her
she
thinks
i
suppose
said
kathleen
that
she
subdue
me
by
these
means
she
wants
to
bring
not
the
long
arm
of
the
law
but
father
arm
right
across
the
sea
to
stop
me
no
no
daddy
your
kathleen
will
be
your
kathleen
to
the
end
always
loving
always
daring
always
true
but
always
rebellious
the
best
and
the
worst
i
am
going
and
i
am
going
all
the
more
surely
because
you
wired
to
me
not
to
go
and
because
they
are
daring
to
bully
dear
little
ruth
craven
and
after
i
have
had
my
fling
i
will
come
back
in
good
time
no
fear
nothing
will
go
wrong
your
kathleen
would
hurt
a
fly
much
less
your
heart
but
i
mean
to
have
my
fun
kathleen
quite
sobered
down
as
these
thoughts
came
to
her
it
was
now
getting
dusk
the
girls
were
to
meet
at
the
station
at
five
they
were
to
go
in
quite
quietly
by
twos
and
twos
each
couple
of
girls
was
to
go
to
the
and
take
their
tickets
and
walk
away
just
as
though
nothing
special
had
happened
they
were
on
no
account
to
collect
in
a
mass
they
were
not
even
to
take
any
notice
of
each
other
until
they
were
off
once
the
train
was
in
motion
all
would
be
safe
they
might
meet
then
and
talk
and
be
merry
to
their
hearts
content
oh
it
was
a
good
good
time
they
were
about
to
have
this
arrangement
about
meeting
one
another
had
been
suggested
by
kate
rourke
who
knew
a
good
deal
about
theatres
and
who
also
knew
how
dangerous
it
would
be
for
so
many
girls
to
be
seen
at
the
station
together
but
dressed
quietly
and
just
dropping
in
by
couples
nobody
would
remark
them
and
then
we
must
go
straight
to
the
theatre
she
said
and
stand
outside
the
pit
and
take
our
chance
but
we
will
have
time
enough
for
that
if
we
leave
merrifield
by
the
train
kathleen
noticed
that
evening
that
alice
watched
her
as
she
moved
about
the
room
that
alice
occasionally
lifted
her
eyes
and
glanced
at
her
when
she
sat
down
to
read
and
when
she
approached
the
and
helped
herself
to
tea
and
and
jam
alice
also
kept
up
that
gentle
sort
of
espionage
it
annoyed
kathleen
she
found
herself
watching
for
it
she
found
herself
getting
red
and
annoyed
when
the
calm
steadfast
gaze
of
alice
brown
eyes
was
fixed
on
her
face
finally
she
said
what
are
you
doing
why
do
you
stare
at
me
sorry
replied
alice
she
bent
over
her
book
and
did
not
glance
again
at
kathleen
kathleen
went
upstairs
she
went
to
their
mutual
room
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
i
must
get
out
of
the
window
she
said
to
herself
i
can
easily
do
it
it
is
but
to
swing
on
to
that
thick
cord
of
ivy
and
i
shall
reach
the
ground
without
the
slightest
trouble
the
that
leads
into
the
garden
is
never
locked
and
the
window
i
mean
to
emerge
from
looks
into
the
garden
i
shall
go
off
without
anybody
noticing
me
kathleen
had
to
take
a
great
deal
of
money
with
her
if
there
were
forty
girls
their
tickets
would
cost
a
good
deal
it
is
true
they
were
to
buy
their
own
in
the
first
instance
but
kathleen
was
to
return
them
the
money
in
the
train
then
the
omnibuses
they
were
to
go
on
the
seats
at
the
theatre
their
supper
of
some
sort
must
be
paid
for
by
the
head
of
the
society
i
promised
to
frank
them
and
i
must
frank
them
thought
the
girl
she
slipped
some
sovereigns
into
her
purse
tucked
it
for
safety
into
the
bosom
of
her
dress
and
then
put
on
her
hat
and
jacket
some
instinct
told
the
wild
ignorant
child
to
dress
quietly
she
put
on
her
plainest
hat
and
a
little
reefer
coat
which
looked
neat
and
substantial
she
was
just
drawing
a
pair
of
gloves
on
her
hands
when
alice
was
heard
turning
the
handle
of
the
door
let
me
in
at
once
kathleen
she
cried
kathleen
did
not
reply
at
all
for
a
moment
then
she
said
in
a
sleepy
smothered
sort
of
voice
which
seemed
to
proceed
from
the
bed
i
have
a
splitting
headache
do
disturb
me
very
sorry
answered
alice
but
i
really
must
come
in
kathleen
made
no
answer
after
a
long
pause
during
which
alice
once
or
twice
felt
the
handle
of
the
door
again
the
sound
of
her
retreating
footsteps
was
heard
now
is
my
time
thought
kathleen
to
tell
the
truth
alice
was
not
at
all
taken
in
by
kathleen
headache
she
is
very
clever
thought
that
young
lady
but
she
has
tried
that
dodge
on
so
often
before
that
i
am
not
going
to
be
deceived
by
it
now
accordingly
she
went
into
her
mother
room
and
stood
by
the
window
now
the
window
of
tennant
bedroom
looked
also
into
the
garden
and
was
really
parallel
with
the
window
by
which
kathleen
meant
to
escape
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
and
then
alice
had
her
reward
for
the
window
of
their
mutual
bedroom
was
flung
wide
open
and
kathleen
neatly
dressed
appeared
on
the
she
looked
around
her
for
a
minute
alice
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
bright
face
by
the
light
of
the
moon
which
was
already
getting
up
in
the
sky
the
next
minute
kathleen
caught
firm
hold
of
the
arm
of
old
ivy
and
let
herself
down
deftly
and
quickly
to
the
ground
the
action
was
done
so
neatly
and
in
fact
so
beautifully
that
alice
in
spite
of
herself
felt
inclined
to
cry
bravo
she
knew
that
if
she
were
to
trust
herself
to
that
ivy
she
would
probably
fall
to
the
bottom
and
get
if
not
really
killed
at
least
half
so
but
kathleen
stood
serenely
on
the
ground
and
glanced
up
at
the
window
from
which
she
had
let
herself
down
just
at
that
moment
alice
rushed
into
their
bedroom
kathleen
had
shut
the
window
behind
her
before
she
trusted
herself
to
the
ivy
she
had
also
unlocked
the
door
in
a
moment
alice
had
put
on
her
hat
and
jacket
had
rushed
downstairs
opened
the
hall
door
and
was
following
kathleen
across
the
common
now
quite
the
nearest
way
to
the
railway
station
was
across
the
common
kathleen
walked
fast
kathleen
kathleen
cried
alice
kathleen
looked
behind
her
she
saw
alice
and
took
to
her
heels
no
no
kathleen
i
will
follow
you
until
i
drop
you
must
let
me
come
up
with
you
but
kathleen
made
no
answer
if
she
could
do
anything
well
she
could
run
in
a
race
her
swift
feet
scarcely
touched
the
ground
she
ran
and
ran
how
soon
would
alice
get
tired
she
did
not
dare
to
go
to
the
railway
station
as
long
as
she
was
following
and
the
time
to
catch
the
train
was
very
short
at
the
other
side
of
the
common
was
a
long
narrow
winding
passage
which
after
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
tortuous
turning
led
right
up
a
to
the
great
terminus
kathleen
had
given
herself
exactly
the
right
length
of
time
had
nothing
happened
to
hinder
her
she
would
have
been
on
the
platform
three
minutes
before
the
train
came
in
for
reasons
of
her
own
she
did
not
wish
to
be
long
there
she
had
crossed
the
common
when
she
looked
behind
her
alice
was
still
running
but
she
was
also
in
the
distance
if
i
could
only
double
hide
for
a
minute
and
make
her
give
up
the
chase
all
would
be
well
thought
the
mischievous
irish
girl
there
was
a
great
tree
which
cast
a
huge
shadow
just
before
the
winding
passage
was
reached
kathleen
darted
towards
it
in
an
instant
she
had
climbed
up
and
was
seated
securely
in
one
of
its
lower
branches
now
if
only
she
will
be
quick
she
will
run
past
me
into
the
passage
she
will
never
get
to
the
end
in
time
i
shall
slip
down
and
go
the
long
way
i
know
it
is
a
good
bit
farther
but
she
is
not
in
it
with
me
as
far
as
running
is
concerned
was
kathleen
thought
alice
came
up
as
far
as
the
tree
she
paused
a
minute
and
looked
around
her
kathleen
in
the
gray
darkness
looked
down
at
her
kathleen
face
was
completely
in
the
shadow
but
the
light
fell
full
on
alice
and
her
face
white
and
anxious
almost
made
the
other
girl
laugh
if
the
situation
was
quite
so
tremendous
i
could
enjoy
this
she
thought
presently
alice
ran
down
the
passage
kathleen
waited
until
her
footsteps
had
died
away
and
then
she
descended
from
the
she
flew
as
fast
as
she
could
the
long
way
to
the
railway
station
alice
ca
think
that
i
want
to
go
by
train
thought
kathleen
now
she
was
truly
a
very
swift
runner
but
as
she
was
running
whom
should
she
meet
but
hopkins
hopkins
was
on
her
way
home
after
doing
a
little
shopping
on
her
own
account
she
saw
kathleen
observed
her
panting
for
breath
and
stood
directly
in
her
path
miss
she
said
can
i
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
it
is
something
very
particular
indeed
i
am
very
thankful
i
happened
to
meet
you
i
will
see
you
panted
kathleen
i
am
in
a
great
hurry
mrs
hopkins
no
miss
it
ought
to
be
you
are
going
to
the
railway
station
are
you
miss
kathleen
felt
inclined
to
knock
that
interfering
woman
down
she
darted
to
one
side
of
the
road
oh
let
me
pass
she
said
she
was
shaking
with
her
quick
run
she
knew
the
moments
were
flying
already
she
heard
the
bell
at
the
station
ring
the
train
for
london
was
signaled
she
had
not
an
instant
to
lose
do
do
keep
me
she
said
but
you
must
go
miss
it
would
be
madness
wicked
you
mus
you
dare
kathleen
pushed
past
her
this
time
hopkins
had
no
power
to
stop
her
she
rushed
on
reached
the
station
flew
up
the
steps
and
found
herself
on
the
platform
just
as
the
train
was
coming
in
instead
of
the
forty
girls
she
expected
to
meet
she
saw
not
more
than
about
they
all
crowded
up
to
her
at
once
i
have
got
your
ticket
for
you
said
susy
i
was
just
able
to
screw
out
the
money
to
get
one
for
you
and
myself
here
the
train
let
us
hop
in
at
once
but
where
are
all
the
others
the
forty
gasped
kathleen
they
funked
it
almost
all
of
them
oh
come
along
here
the
train
the
great
train
thundered
into
the
station
the
girls
ran
wildly
looking
for
a
carriage
at
last
they
found
one
and
tumbled
into
it
the
door
was
slammed
and
they
were
off
kathleen
wondered
she
was
not
sure
but
she
wondered
if
she
really
did
see
or
if
it
was
only
a
dream
a
pair
of
brown
eyes
looking
at
her
from
the
station
and
the
severe
young
figure
and
shocked
face
of
alice
tennant
it
must
have
been
a
dream
she
could
not
have
guessed
that
i
was
going
to
the
station
what
a
good
thing
she
did
meet
mrs
hopkins
thought
kathleen
then
she
turned
to
her
companions
to
the
six
girls
who
had
decided
to
brave
all
the
terrors
of
their
expedition
they
were
susy
hopkins
kate
rourke
clara
sawyer
rosy
myers
janey
ford
and
mary
wilkins
kathleen
sat
quite
still
for
a
minute
until
she
had
recovered
her
breath
she
looked
around
her
to
her
relief
she
saw
that
they
were
alone
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
compartment
now
then
she
said
how
is
it
that
all
the
others
have
funked
it
there
has
been
so
much
muttering
and
whispering
and
suspecting
going
on
during
the
whole
livelong
day
that
they
were
positively
afraid
said
susy
indeed
if
it
had
been
for
you
kathleen
i
doubt
if
any
of
us
would
have
come
well
girls
we
ca
help
it
said
kathleen
if
the
rest
are
so
timid
there
more
fun
for
us
is
that
so
she
looked
round
at
her
companions
i
mean
to
enjoy
myself
said
kate
rourke
i
have
been
to
a
theater
twice
before
once
i
went
with
my
grandfather
and
another
time
with
an
uncle
from
australia
i
did
go
to
the
pit
when
i
went
with
uncle
he
took
me
to
a
grand
stall
and
we
rubbed
up
against
the
nobility
i
can
tell
you
it
suddenly
occurred
to
kathleen
that
kate
rourke
was
rather
a
vulgar
girl
she
drew
a
little
nearer
to
her
however
and
fixed
her
very
bright
eyes
on
the
girl
face
but
we
need
go
to
the
pit
need
we
she
said
i
meant
to
pay
for
forty
if
there
are
only
six
why
should
we
have
jolly
seats
somewhere
and
not
waste
our
time
outside
the
theater
that
would
be
nice
said
kate
rourke
i
always
enjoy
myself
so
much
more
if
i
am
in
good
company
i
have
been
looking
up
the
plays
at
the
theaters
and
there
is
a
very
fine
piece
on
at
the
princess
that
is
in
oxford
street
it
is
a
sort
of
melodrama
there
a
deal
of
killing
in
it
and
the
heroine
has
to
do
some
desperate
deeds
oh
dear
said
susy
with
a
sigh
i
do
feel
somehow
as
if
i
much
cared
where
we
went
it
will
be
awful
afterwards
when
the
fun
is
over
but
we
will
enjoy
ourselves
susy
while
the
fun
lasts
said
kathleen
she
tried
to
believe
that
she
was
enjoying
herself
and
was
having
a
right
good
time
she
tried
to
forget
the
fact
that
alice
tennant
might
really
have
seen
her
off
and
that
hopkins
had
justice
in
her
remarks
when
she
begged
and
implored
of
kathleen
not
to
go
to
the
train
what
can
she
have
found
out
she
thought
she
now
turned
to
susy
has
your
mother
learned
anything
susy
she
said
what
do
you
mean
said
susy
turning
very
pink
well
you
know
as
i
was
running
here
oh
girls
i
had
such
a
lark
what
do
you
think
happened
that
horrid
alice
alice
tennant
ran
after
me
as
i
was
leaving
the
house
i
raced
her
across
the
common
and
then
to
get
rid
of
her
i
climbed
up
into
an
she
never
saw
me
and
ran
on
down
the
passage
of
course
my
only
chance
of
getting
to
the
station
was
to
go
by
the
long
there
i
came
across
your
mother
susy
and
she
tried
to
stop
me
and
said
she
must
speak
to
me
dear
she
did
seem
in
a
state
evidently
there
a
great
deal
of
excitement
and
watching
going
on
in
that
school
there
will
be
a
great
deal
of
excitement
said
susy
it
strikes
me
it
will
be
all
up
with
us
that
is
if
ruth
tells
if
ruth
tells
what
do
you
mean
they
are
going
to
do
their
utmost
to
get
her
to
tell
and
if
she
does
tell
they
will
call
out
our
names
and
expel
us
that
all
oh
i
bear
to
think
of
it
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
it
susy
voice
broke
tears
trembled
in
her
bright
black
eyes
and
she
turned
her
head
to
one
side
kathleen
gave
her
a
quick
glance
it
will
be
all
right
she
said
ruth
wo
tell
ruth
is
the
kind
who
never
tells
she
told
me
she
would
she
be
a
brick
if
she
does
said
kate
rourke
but
then
of
course
you
know
i
know
what
oh
nothing
what
the
good
of
making
ourselves
melancholy
on
a
night
like
this
if
i
were
expelled
said
clara
sawyer
i
should
leave
merrifield
i
could
never
lift
up
my
head
again
you
ca
think
what
impudent
sort
of
boys
my
brothers
are
and
they
have
always
twitted
me
for
my
good
fortune
in
getting
into
the
great
shirley
school
they
say
that
if
we
are
to
be
expelled
it
will
be
done
in
public
the
governors
are
determined
to
read
us
a
lesson
that
what
they
say
who
cares
what
they
say
said
kathleen
let
them
say
well
that
what
i
think
and
i
dare
say
half
of
it
is
untrue
said
little
janey
ford
i
am
sure
janey
wonders
will
never
cease
when
we
see
you
in
this
thing
said
susy
it
was
disgusting
of
the
others
to
funk
it
but
i
suppose
they
were
on
the
right
side
only
i
do
sometimes
hate
being
on
the
right
do
you
kathleen
yes
said
kathleen
in
a
whisper
and
she
squeezed
susy
hand
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
soul
and
susy
had
met
at
that
moment
and
had
saluted
each
other
like
comrades
true
but
how
was
it
you
came
janey
did
your
little
heart
funk
it
altogether
continued
kate
i
was
so
mad
to
come
said
janey
i
am
shaking
and
trembling
now
like
anything
but
i
had
never
been
to
a
theater
and
it
was
such
a
tremendous
temptation
i
said
about
ten
times
to
myself
that
i
come
but
eleven
times
i
said
that
i
would
and
the
eleventh
time
conquered
and
here
i
am
i
do
hope
we
have
a
right
good
time
with
this
sort
of
chatter
the
girls
got
to
london
here
kate
rourke
took
the
lead
she
marshaled
the
little
party
in
two
and
two
and
so
conveyed
them
out
of
the
station
outside
the
yard
at
charing
cross
they
all
climbed
on
the
top
of
an
omnibus
and
soon
were
wending
their
way
in
the
direction
of
the
princess
theater
which
kate
most
strongly
advocated
there
was
no
crowd
at
the
theater
this
special
evening
the
piece
which
was
presented
on
the
boards
happened
to
be
a
fairly
good
one
the
girls
got
excellent
seats
and
found
themselves
in
the
front
row
of
the
family
circle
from
there
they
could
look
down
on
dazzling
scenes
and
kathleen
who
had
never
been
to
a
theater
in
the
whole
course
of
her
life
was
delighted
she
at
least
had
forgotten
what
might
follow
this
expedition
oh
yes
they
were
having
a
glorious
time
and
it
was
quite
right
to
do
what
you
liked
sometimes
and
quite
right
to
defy
your
elders
oh
how
many
she
was
defying
ruth
craven
who
would
almost
have
given
her
life
to
keep
her
back
from
this
miss
ravenscroft
the
to
whom
kathleen
heart
did
not
go
out
her
own
father
her
own
aunt
alice
tennant
oh
bother
alice
tennant
and
last
hopkins
quite
an
army
of
them
thought
kathleen
i
have
dared
to
do
what
none
of
them
approved
of
and
i
am
not
a
bit
the
worse
for
it
darling
dad
your
own
kathleen
will
tell
you
everything
and
you
may
give
me
what
punishment
you
think
best
when
the
fun
is
over
but
now
i
am
having
a
jolly
time
so
kathleen
did
enjoy
herself
and
made
so
many
saucy
remarks
between
the
acts
and
looked
so
radiant
notwithstanding
her
very
plain
dress
that
several
people
looked
at
the
beautiful
girl
and
commented
about
her
and
her
companions
a
school
party
my
dear
said
a
lady
to
her
husband
but
i
do
see
the
chaperone
he
remarked
and
then
the
lady
who
looked
again
more
carefully
could
not
help
observing
that
these
seven
girls
were
certainly
not
chaperoned
by
any
one
a
little
wonder
and
a
little
uneasiness
came
into
her
heart
she
was
a
very
kind
woman
herself
she
was
a
motherly
woman
too
and
she
thought
of
her
own
girls
tucked
up
safely
in
bed
at
home
and
wondered
what
she
would
feel
if
they
were
alone
at
a
london
theater
at
this
hour
presently
something
impelled
her
to
bend
forward
and
touch
kathleen
on
her
arm
kathleen
gave
a
little
start
and
faced
her
forgive
me
she
said
i
see
that
you
and
your
companions
are
schoolgirls
are
you
not
to
some
people
kathleen
might
have
answered
that
is
our
own
affair
not
yours
but
to
this
lady
with
the
courteous
face
and
the
gentle
voice
she
replied
in
quite
a
humble
tone
yes
madam
we
are
schoolgirls
and
if
you
will
forgive
me
dear
have
you
no
lady
looking
after
you
no
said
kate
rourke
bending
forward
at
that
moment
we
are
out
for
a
spree
all
by
our
lone
selves
kate
gave
a
loud
laugh
as
she
spoke
the
lady
started
back
and
could
not
help
contrasting
kathleen
face
with
those
of
the
other
girls
she
bent
towards
her
husband
and
whispered
in
his
ear
the
result
of
this
communication
was
that
the
curtain
having
fallen
for
the
last
time
the
actors
having
left
the
stage
the
play
being
completely
over
and
the
seven
girls
being
about
to
get
back
to
charing
cross
as
best
they
could
the
lady
touched
kathleen
on
her
arm
you
will
forgive
me
dear
she
said
i
am
a
mother
and
have
daughters
of
my
own
i
should
not
like
to
see
girls
in
the
position
you
are
in
without
offering
to
help
them
but
what
do
you
mean
said
kathleen
i
mean
this
my
dear
that
my
husband
and
i
will
see
you
seven
back
to
your
home
wherever
it
is
kathleen
burst
out
laughing
then
she
looked
very
grave
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
said
but
would
mother
approve
of
it
if
your
mother
is
the
least
like
me
she
would
not
approve
of
it
she
would
be
horrified
i
do
think
the
lady
can
see
us
home
here
remarked
clara
sawyer
for
we
live
at
merrifield
a
good
long
way
from
london
again
the
lady
and
her
husband
had
a
talk
together
and
then
she
suggested
that
they
should
take
the
girls
back
with
them
to
charing
cross
and
put
them
into
their
train
but
we
thought
we
have
a
bit
of
supper
said
kate
rourke
i
can
get
you
some
things
at
the
railway
station
you
ought
not
to
wait
for
supper
in
town
said
the
gentleman
in
a
stern
voice
then
somehow
all
the
girls
felt
ashamed
of
themselves
kathleen
slightly
more
ashamed
than
the
others
they
left
the
theater
very
slowly
with
all
the
lightsomeness
and
gladness
of
heart
gone
two
cabs
were
secured
for
the
little
party
and
with
their
kind
protectors
they
were
taken
back
to
charing
cross
eventually
they
got
seats
in
a
comfortable
carriage
and
found
themselves
going
back
again
to
merrifield
well
it
has
been
a
dull
sort
of
thing
altogether
said
clara
sawyer
what
meddlesome
people
do
said
kathleen
do
what
kathleen
why
should
you
speak
to
me
in
that
reproving
voice
it
is
that
only
they
were
like
two
angels
i
know
it
i
am
sure
of
it
we
did
an
awful
thing
coming
to
town
i
know
we
did
and
i
feel
oh
detestable
kathleen
bent
her
head
forward
covered
it
with
her
hands
and
sat
still
no
tears
shook
her
little
frame
but
there
was
a
storm
within
to
her
dying
day
kathleen
never
forgot
that
return
journey
truly
the
fun
was
all
over
the
dregs
of
the
cup
of
pleasure
were
in
their
mouths
and
there
was
a
fear
great
certain
and
very
terrible
in
their
hearts
but
with
all
her
fears
and
they
were
many
kathleen
thought
again
and
again
of
the
lady
who
had
girls
of
her
own
and
of
the
gentleman
who
was
both
stern
and
chivalrous
who
had
the
manners
of
a
prince
and
the
look
of
a
gentleman
as
long
as
she
lived
she
remembered
those
two
faces
and
the
words
of
the
lady
and
the
smile
with
which
she
said
she
never
learned
their
names
perhaps
she
did
not
want
to
chapter
xxvi
the
right
side
of
the
ledger
ruth
got
up
rather
earlier
than
usual
on
that
saturday
morning
she
had
a
dull
stunned
kind
of
feeling
round
her
heart
she
was
glad
of
that
she
was
glad
that
she
was
not
acutely
sorry
or
acutely
glad
or
acutely
anxious
about
anything
if
i
could
always
be
like
this
nothing
would
matter
she
said
to
herself
she
dressed
with
her
usual
scrupulous
neatness
and
after
hesitating
for
a
moment
put
on
her
best
sunday
serge
dress
it
was
a
serge
very
neatly
made
she
combed
back
her
luxurious
hair
and
tied
it
with
a
ribbon
to
match
the
dress
she
then
ran
downstairs
why
ruth
said
her
grandmother
who
was
pouring
some
porridge
into
bowls
what
are
you
wearing
that
frock
for
i
thought
i
would
like
to
granny
well
to
be
sure
i
trust
to
goodness
you
are
not
getting
extravagant
it
will
be
doomsday
before
we
can
get
you
another
like
it
you
must
remember
that
i
saved
up
for
it
sixpence
by
sixpence
and
it
took
me
all
my
time
and
my
best
endeavors
to
get
it
i
know
it
granny
and
when
i
wear
it
i
feel
that
you
were
very
kind
to
give
it
me
a
girl
who
wears
a
dress
like
this
ought
to
be
very
very
good
ought
she
granny
well
to
be
sure
little
woman
and
so
you
are
there
never
was
a
better
child
sit
down
now
and
sup
your
porridge
it
is
extra
good
this
morning
and
there
a
drop
of
cream
in
that
jug
which
will
give
it
a
flavor
ruth
sat
down
to
the
table
and
drew
her
bowl
of
porridge
towards
her
the
warm
nourishing
food
seemed
to
choke
her
but
all
the
same
she
ate
it
with
resolution
that
right
dear
said
her
grandmother
putting
a
bit
of
color
into
your
cheeks
you
are
too
white
altogether
ruth
i
hope
my
dear
you
are
not
working
too
hard
oh
that
all
right
said
ruth
keeping
back
a
groan
it
a
fine
thing
your
getting
into
that
school
continued
craven
it
gives
you
a
chance
do
you
know
now
when
i
look
at
you
and
see
the
pretty
little
girl
you
are
turning
into
and
observe
your
ways
which
every
one
remarks
on
i
think
of
the
time
when
your
father
was
your
age
yes
granny
said
ruth
brightening
up
and
looking
earnestly
at
the
old
lady
you
never
care
to
talk
about
father
but
i
should
greatly
like
to
hear
about
him
this
morning
well
child
i
do
talk
of
him
because
it
hurts
me
too
much
he
was
the
only
child
i
ever
had
and
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
i
get
over
his
death
but
he
was
like
you
very
neat
in
his
person
and
very
particular
and
always
keen
over
his
books
and
do
you
know
what
he
said
to
his
father
it
was
when
he
was
fifteen
years
old
just
for
all
the
world
about
the
age
you
are
now
i
mind
the
time
as
well
as
if
it
was
yesterday
her
father
and
i
were
sitting
by
the
hearth
and
the
boy
came
and
stood
near
us
your
grandfather
looked
up
at
him
and
his
blue
eyes
seemed
to
melt
with
love
and
pride
and
he
said
will
you
be
my
boy
will
you
let
me
teach
you
the
business
and
save
up
all
the
money
i
can
for
you
to
sell
groceries
on
a
bigger
scale
there
many
a
small
business
like
mine
which
when
built
up
means
a
great
big
business
and
much
wealth
if
you
have
a
turn
that
way
i
could
set
you
on
your
legs
i
am
certain
of
it
i
like
to
do
it
would
you
like
that
best
or
would
you
rather
have
a
profession
and
be
made
a
gentleman
gentleman
part
does
matter
said
our
boy
in
reply
to
that
i
think
father
if
you
can
give
me
my
choice
i
like
best
to
be
that
which
if
necessary
would
oblige
me
to
give
my
life
do
you
mean
asked
his
father
and
the
lad
explained
with
his
eyes
shining
have
only
got
one
life
he
said
i
like
to
give
it
if
necessary
to
tell
the
truth
ruth
i
could
not
understand
him
but
i
can
said
ruth
she
hastily
put
down
her
porridge
spoon
and
jumped
to
her
feet
i
can
understand
she
continued
and
i
am
proud
of
him
so
he
went
into
the
army
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
him
in
his
uniform
and
his
father
paid
for
every
scrap
of
the
whole
thing
and
educated
him
and
all
oh
dear
it
was
a
proud
moment
but
we
proud
afterwards
when
we
heard
that
he
was
killed
his
father
reminded
me
of
his
words
like
to
be
that
for
which
i
could
give
my
life
if
necessary
there
was
quite
a
pink
color
in
each
of
ruth
cheeks
now
and
her
eyes
were
very
bright
i
will
go
and
see
grandfather
she
said
and
then
i
must
be
off
to
school
she
left
the
kitchen
and
went
into
the
tiny
parlor
where
the
old
man
was
seated
it
was
his
fashion
to
get
up
early
and
go
straight
to
the
parlor
and
read
or
talk
softly
to
himself
for
a
couple
of
months
now
he
had
never
sat
in
the
kitchen
he
said
it
caused
a
buzzing
in
his
head
craven
brought
him
his
meals
into
the
little
parlor
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
when
ruth
in
her
neat
sunday
dress
entered
the
room
there
was
an
exalted
feeling
in
her
heart
caused
by
the
narrative
which
her
grandmother
had
told
her
of
her
father
well
little
woman
said
the
old
man
and
you
are
off
to
school
or
is
it
school
perhaps
it
is
sunday
morning
and
you
are
off
to
church
no
grandfather
it
is
saturday
morning
quite
a
different
thing
well
my
love
i
am
as
pleased
as
punch
about
that
school
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
think
about
it
and
love
to
feel
that
my
own
little
lass
is
doing
so
well
there
and
if
you
get
the
scholarship
why
we
will
be
made
we
wo
have
another
care
nor
anxiety
we
wo
have
another
wrinkle
of
trouble
as
long
as
we
remain
in
the
world
ruth
went
straight
over
to
the
old
man
knelt
down
by
his
side
and
looked
into
his
face
stroke
my
hair
granddad
she
said
he
raised
his
trembling
hand
and
placed
it
on
her
head
that
is
nice
she
said
and
caught
his
hand
as
it
went
backwards
and
forwards
over
her
silky
black
hair
and
kissed
it
granddad
she
said
after
a
pause
is
it
the
best
thing
quite
the
best
thing
always
to
come
out
on
the
right
side
of
the
ledger
eh
listen
to
the
little
woman
said
the
old
man
much
pleased
and
interested
by
her
words
why
of
course
ruth
it
is
the
only
thing
but
does
it
mean
sometimes
grandfather
dishonor
no
it
never
means
that
said
craven
gravely
and
thoughtfully
but
i
will
tell
you
what
ruthie
it
does
mean
sometimes
all
you
have
got
yes
said
ruth
i
understand
she
rose
to
her
feet
do
you
think
my
father
would
have
come
out
on
the
right
side
of
the
ledger
ah
child
when
he
lay
dead
on
the
field
of
battle
he
came
very
much
out
on
the
right
side
to
my
thinking
but
why
that
melancholy
note
in
your
voice
ruth
and
why
are
your
cheeks
so
flushed
is
anything
the
matter
kiss
me
said
ruth
i
am
glad
you
have
said
what
you
did
about
father
i
am
more
glad
than
sorry
on
the
whole
this
morning
grandfather
she
kissed
him
then
she
raised
her
head
and
walked
out
of
the
room
with
a
gentle
dignity
all
her
own
what
has
come
to
the
little
woman
thought
the
old
man
but
in
a
minute
or
two
he
forgot
her
and
called
to
his
wife
to
bring
him
the
why
do
you
bother
yourself
about
them
she
asked
it
has
come
over
me
he
replied
that
i
have
counted
things
wrong
and
that
i
come
out
on
the
right
side
if
i
am
a
bit
more
careful
put
the
books
on
this
little
table
and
leave
me
for
an
hour
or
two
right
old
woman
very
well
old
man
she
replied
and
she
pushed
the
table
towards
him
put
the
thereon
and
left
the
room
meanwhile
ruth
went
slowly
to
school
she
was
in
good
time
there
was
no
need
to
hurry
the
morning
was
fresh
and
beautiful
there
was
a
gentle
breeze
which
fanned
her
face
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
she
let
her
soul
go
it
would
mount
on
that
breeze
and
get
up
high
above
the
clouds
and
the
temptations
of
earth
i
am
glad
she
said
to
herself
the
right
side
of
the
ledger
means
giving
up
all
and
the
best
of
life
is
to
be
able
to
lose
it
if
necessary
i
will
cling
to
these
two
thoughts
and
i
do
believe
if
the
worst
comes
that
anything
can
really
hurt
me
when
she
got
near
the
school
she
was
met
by
hopkins
she
was
amazed
to
see
that
good
woman
as
at
that
hour
she
was
usually
busily
engaged
in
her
shop
but
hopkins
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
said
quietly
i
came
out
on
purpose
to
see
you
ruth
craven
well
and
what
do
you
want
asked
ruth
my
dear
you
are
not
looking
too
well
please
do
not
mind
my
looks
it
is
just
this
dear
there
will
be
no
end
of
a
fuss
in
the
school
ruth
did
not
reply
and
they
will
press
you
hard
still
ruth
made
no
answer
you
know
what
it
will
mean
if
you
tell
ruth
grave
eyes
were
fixed
on
hopkins
face
child
i
do
want
to
doubt
you
nobody
who
knows
you
could
do
that
but
it
will
mean
ruin
to
poor
susy
and
to
many
and
many
a
girl
at
the
great
shirley
school
it
is
so
much
miss
we
mean
miss
has
gone
into
this
with
her
eyes
open
and
she
is
rich
and
what
is
disgrace
to
her
in
this
little
part
of
england
when
she
herself
lives
in
a
great
big
castle
in
ireland
and
is
a
queen
lady
and
all
the
rest
but
it
means
oh
such
a
frightful
lot
to
so
many
now
susy
for
instance
i
meant
to
apprentice
her
to
a
good
trade
when
she
had
gone
through
her
course
of
work
at
the
great
shirley
but
she
will
have
to
be
a
servant
a
little
and
i
think
that
it
would
break
my
heart
if
she
was
expelled
and
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
mrs
hopkins
oh
my
dear
not
to
think
of
yourself
but
of
the
many
who
will
be
ruined
not
to
tell
ruth
craven
ruth
gave
a
gentle
smile
then
she
put
out
her
small
slim
hand
and
touched
hopkins
and
then
turned
and
continued
her
walk
to
the
school
there
were
a
group
of
foundationers
standing
round
the
entrance
ruth
longed
to
avoid
them
but
they
saw
her
and
clustered
round
her
and
each
and
all
began
to
whisper
in
her
ears
you
will
be
faithful
ruth
nothing
will
induce
you
to
tell
it
will
be
hard
on
you
but
you
wo
ruin
so
many
of
us
it
is
better
for
one
to
suffer
than
for
all
to
suffer
you
wo
tell
will
you
ruth
ruth
made
no
reply
in
words
the
great
bell
rang
the
doors
of
the
school
were
flung
wide
and
the
girls
ruth
amongst
them
entered
chapter
xxvii
after
the
fun
comes
the
deluge
kathleen
nature
was
of
the
kind
that
rises
to
the
top
of
the
mountains
and
sinks
again
to
the
lowest
vales
she
had
been
on
the
of
the
hills
of
her
own
fantasy
all
that
evening
when
she
ran
quickly
home
under
the
stars
she
began
to
realize
what
she
had
done
she
had
done
something
of
which
her
mother
would
have
been
ashamed
not
for
a
moment
had
kathleen
thought
of
this
way
of
looking
at
her
escapade
until
she
read
the
truth
in
the
eyes
of
the
unknown
but
most
kind
lady
she
despised
herself
for
her
own
action
but
she
did
not
dread
discovery
it
did
not
occur
to
her
as
possible
that
what
she
and
her
companions
had
done
could
be
known
if
no
one
knew
no
one
need
be
at
all
more
sorry
or
at
all
more
unhappy
on
account
of
her
action
poor
wild
irish
girls
they
are
getting
into
hot
water
she
said
to
herself
but
this
little
bit
of
fun
need
never
be
told
to
any
one
kathleen
had
let
herself
out
of
the
house
by
the
strong
rope
of
ivy
she
meant
to
return
to
her
bedroom
the
same
way
alice
was
a
very
sound
sleeper
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
alice
on
that
particular
night
might
be
awake
she
reached
the
foot
of
the
window
in
perfect
safety
saw
that
the
ivy
looked
precisely
as
it
had
looked
when
she
climbed
down
it
and
began
her
upward
ascent
this
was
decidedly
more
difficult
than
her
downward
one
but
she
was
light
of
foot
and
agile
had
she
not
climbed
dangerous
crags
after
young
eaglets
at
home
she
reached
the
how
nice
the
window
was
partly
open
she
pushed
it
wider
and
got
in
the
room
was
in
darkness
so
much
the
better
she
stepped
softly
reached
her
own
bed
undressed
and
lay
down
how
nice
of
alice
to
be
sound
asleep
then
of
course
it
was
not
alice
she
saw
standing
on
the
platform
looking
at
her
with
reproachful
horrified
eyes
i
must
have
dreamt
it
thought
kathleen
now
all
is
well
and
i
shall
sleep
like
a
top
until
the
morning
this
however
was
no
easy
feat
alice
quiet
breathing
sounded
not
many
feet
away
and
after
a
time
it
seemed
to
get
on
kathleen
nerves
she
moved
restlessly
in
her
bed
alice
awoke
and
complained
of
the
cold
the
window
is
a
little
open
said
kathleen
shall
i
shut
it
alice
made
no
answer
kathleen
jumped
up
shut
the
window
and
fastened
it
she
then
got
back
into
bed
in
the
morning
alice
called
out
to
her
is
your
headache
better
had
i
one
began
kathleen
then
she
blushed
then
she
laughed
then
she
said
oh
it
quite
well
alice
gazed
steadily
at
her
it
seemed
to
kathleen
that
alice
eyes
were
full
of
something
very
terrible
are
you
coming
to
school
asked
alice
the
next
moment
of
course
why
do
you
ask
such
a
strange
question
i
should
think
you
would
wish
to
but
there
is
no
accounting
for
what
some
people
can
live
through
alice
what
do
you
mean
what
i
say
explain
yourself
no
is
there
anything
very
awful
going
to
happen
at
school
you
will
find
out
for
yourself
when
you
get
there
dear
me
said
kathleen
you
look
as
if
the
deluge
was
coming
and
so
it
is
said
alice
she
had
finished
dressing
by
now
and
she
went
out
of
the
room
the
two
girls
went
down
to
breakfast
alice
face
was
still
full
of
an
awful
suppressed
knowledge
which
she
would
not
let
out
to
any
one
but
tennant
was
smiling
and
looking
just
as
usual
and
the
boys
were
as
fond
of
kathleen
as
was
their
wont
she
had
completely
won
their
immature
masculine
hearts
and
they
invariably
sat
one
on
each
side
of
her
at
meals
helped
her
to
the
best
the
table
contained
and
fussed
over
her
in
a
way
that
pleased
her
young
majesty
kathleen
was
very
glad
that
morning
to
get
the
boys
attention
she
determined
to
sit
with
her
back
slightly
turned
to
alice
in
order
not
to
look
into
her
face
they
were
about
through
breakfast
when
there
came
a
ring
at
the
and
cassandra
weldon
voice
was
heard
alice
went
out
to
her
the
two
girls
kept
whispering
together
in
the
passage
presently
alice
returned
to
the
and
kathleen
now
noticed
that
her
eyes
were
red
as
though
she
had
just
been
indulging
in
a
bout
of
crying
what
can
be
the
matter
she
thought
why
my
dear
alice
said
her
mother
looking
up
at
this
moment
what
did
cassandra
want
and
what
is
the
matter
with
you
have
you
had
bad
news
yes
mother
answered
alice
but
what
is
it
dear
you
will
know
soon
enough
mother
that
is
exactly
what
you
said
to
me
upstairs
said
kathleen
driven
desperate
by
alice
manner
i
do
wish
you
would
speak
do
get
her
to
speak
out
tennant
she
hints
at
something
awful
going
to
happen
at
school
i
declare
i
wo
go
if
it
is
as
bad
as
that
it
would
be
like
you
not
to
come
said
alice
but
i
think
you
will
come
i
do
think
you
will
be
allowed
to
be
absent
allowed
said
kathleen
who
is
going
to
prevent
me
staying
away
from
school
if
i
wish
to
the
vote
of
the
majority
said
alice
very
firmly
now
look
here
kathleen
do
make
a
fuss
it
is
wrong
for
the
girls
of
the
great
shirley
school
to
absent
themselves
without
due
reason
well
i
have
a
headache
i
had
one
last
night
no
you
had
not
alice
dear
why
do
you
speak
to
kathleen
like
that
said
her
mother
what
is
the
matter
with
you
kathleen
do
keep
your
alice
i
am
sorry
something
has
annoyed
you
so
much
it
is
past
speaking
about
mother
you
will
understand
all
too
kathleen
it
is
time
for
us
to
be
going
i
am
not
going
said
kathleen
so
there
kathleen
you
are
no
come
kathleen
come
you
need
fuss
about
me
i
am
not
coming
kathleen
dear
i
think
you
ought
to
go
go
for
my
sake
said
tennant
kathleen
looked
up
then
saw
the
anxiety
in
tennant
face
and
her
heart
relented
she
was
in
reality
not
at
all
afraid
of
what
might
be
going
to
happen
at
school
if
there
was
to
be
a
fray
she
desired
nothing
better
than
to
be
in
the
midst
of
it
all
right
she
said
i
will
go
but
i
wo
go
yet
i
am
going
to
be
late
this
morning
i
can
see
by
your
manner
alice
that
i
have
got
into
disgrace
now
i
ca
think
what
disgrace
i
have
got
into
unless
some
horrid
girls
have
been
prying
and
telling
tales
out
of
school
that
sort
of
thing
i
should
think
even
the
great
shirley
girls
would
not
attempt
unless
some
one
has
been
mean
enough
to
act
in
that
way
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
to
prevent
my
going
to
school
and
taking
my
accustomed
place
and
disporting
myself
in
my
usual
manner
i
shall
get
a
bad
mark
for
being
late
that
is
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
me
i
am
going
to
be
very
late
so
you
can
go
on
by
yourself
alice
alice
very
nearly
stamped
her
foot
she
went
so
far
as
to
beg
and
implore
of
kathleen
but
kathleen
was
imperturbable
you
are
very
naughty
kathleen
said
tennant
but
kathleen
ran
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
you
and
i
will
have
some
fun
perhaps
this
afternoon
she
said
i
have
got
a
lot
of
new
plans
in
my
head
they
are
all
about
you
and
to
make
you
happy
and
not
so
tired
do
be
cross
with
me
i
promise
that
i
will
never
be
naughty
again
after
tennant
said
nothing
more
a
minute
or
two
later
alice
left
the
house
it
was
quite
an
hour
after
alice
had
departed
that
kathleen
took
it
into
her
head
that
she
might
as
well
stroll
towards
the
school
on
saturdays
school
was
over
a
little
earlier
than
other
days
there
was
a
special
class
which
she
was
anxious
not
to
miss
for
in
spite
of
herself
she
was
becoming
interested
in
certain
portions
of
her
lessons
her
depression
had
now
left
her
and
she
felt
excited
but
at
the
same
time
irritated
a
spirit
of
defiance
came
over
her
she
went
upstairs
and
selected
from
her
heterogeneous
wardrobe
one
of
her
very
prettiest
and
most
fashionable
and
most
unsuitable
dresses
she
put
on
a
hat
trimmed
with
flowers
and
feathers
and
a
sash
of
many
colors
round
her
waist
over
all
she
slipped
her
velvet
jacket
and
with
rich
sables
round
her
neck
and
wrists
she
ran
downstairs
why
kathleen
any
one
would
suppose
you
were
going
to
a
concert
said
tennant
ah
my
dear
good
friend
i
like
to
look
jolly
once
in
a
way
i
am
certain
to
get
a
bad
mark
for
unpunctuality
so
i
may
as
well
get
it
looking
my
best
as
my
worst
you
do
blame
me
for
that
do
you
no
go
off
now
dear
and
do
let
me
find
you
so
troublesome
again
kathleen
started
off
she
ran
across
the
common
and
reached
the
doors
of
the
great
school
exactly
one
hour
after
she
ought
to
have
arrived
to
her
amazement
she
saw
quite
a
crowd
of
people
waiting
outside
and
amongst
them
was
hopkins
there
were
several
other
mothers
as
well
and
when
they
saw
kathleen
they
turned
their
backs
on
her
and
one
or
two
were
heard
to
say
aloud
it
she
who
has
done
it
but
hopkins
did
not
turn
her
back
on
kathleen
she
came
close
to
her
and
even
took
her
hand
why
are
you
late
miss
she
said
but
perhaps
it
is
best
miss
you
wo
forget
my
poor
aunt
you
will
be
sure
to
get
her
the
little
almshouse
in
ireland
yes
of
course
i
will
said
kathleen
aunt
katie
has
written
about
it
already
and
i
will
write
you
may
tell
church
that
it
is
absolutely
quite
certain
that
she
will
get
it
what
is
the
matter
hopkins
how
strange
you
look
and
all
those
other
women
they
seem
quite
cross
with
me
what
have
i
done
ah
miss
i
keep
saying
to
them
that
it
is
because
you
are
irish
and
do
know
frolic
from
serious
mischief
bless
your
heart
miss
it
is
you
that
are
kind
you
mean
kindly
no
one
more
so
and
so
i
have
said
to
them
but
it
will
be
a
nice
thing
if
my
girl
gets
expelled
owing
to
her
said
a
woman
coming
forward
now
and
placing
her
arms
akimbo
just
in
front
of
kathleen
is
it
that
that
every
one
is
thinking
about
said
kathleen
she
stood
still
for
a
minute
the
color
left
her
face
she
felt
a
wave
of
tempestuous
blood
pressing
against
her
heart
then
it
all
rushed
back
in
a
fiery
color
into
her
cheeks
and
in
brightness
to
her
eyes
and
alice
knew
of
this
she
said
to
herself
and
when
i
did
come
to
school
this
morning
she
thought
that
i
was
afraid
afraid
keep
me
good
people
said
kathleen
make
way
please
i
am
sorry
i
am
a
little
late
she
walked
past
them
all
when
she
got
as
far
as
the
school
door
she
turned
to
hopkins
you
can
tell
your
aunt
that
the
almshouse
is
safe
she
said
and
then
she
blew
a
kiss
to
her
and
disappeared
into
the
school
chapter
xxviii
who
was
the
ringleader
in
the
passage
a
monitress
was
standing
and
when
she
saw
kathleen
she
came
up
to
her
and
said
in
an
agitated
tone
they
are
all
assembled
in
the
great
hall
go
in
quickly
you
may
be
in
time
after
all
the
voice
of
the
monitress
quite
shook
and
there
was
a
troubled
very
nearly
tearful
expression
in
her
eyes
but
why
is
the
whole
school
in
the
central
hall
asked
kathleen
why
are
they
not
in
their
different
classrooms
go
in
go
in
said
the
monitress
you
will
know
when
you
find
yourself
there
and
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
so
kathleen
impelled
by
a
curious
power
which
seemed
to
drive
her
whether
she
will
it
or
not
opened
the
door
of
the
great
central
hall
and
entered
she
found
it
quite
full
the
four
hundred
girls
who
composed
the
great
shirley
school
were
all
present
so
were
the
teachers
and
so
were
the
professors
who
came
to
give
them
music
and
drawing
and
literature
lessons
so
was
the
miss
ravenscroft
and
also
seated
on
the
same
little
raised
platform
were
the
six
ladies
who
formed
the
governors
the
governors
sat
in
a
little
circle
miss
mackenzie
in
the
middle
miss
mackenzie
looked
hard
and
very
firm
her
hair
her
false
teeth
her
prominent
nose
and
her
rather
cruel
eyes
made
themselves
felt
all
down
the
long
room
the
other
ladies
also
looked
as
they
usually
did
except
that
naylor
had
traces
of
tears
in
her
eyes
and
bent
forward
several
times
to
whisper
something
to
miss
mackenzie
who
invariably
shook
her
head
and
looked
more
stern
than
ever
there
was
evidently
a
moment
pause
and
the
whole
school
was
in
a
waiting
attitude
when
kathleen
made
her
appearance
all
eyes
were
then
turned
in
her
direction
all
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
the
showily
dressed
and
very
handsome
child
who
suddenly
entered
the
room
it
is
kathleen
it
is
kathleen
herself
well
she
has
come
at
last
yes
it
is
kathleen
passed
from
lip
to
lip
until
kathleen
felt
that
her
name
had
got
round
her
and
above
her
and
to
right
and
left
of
her
she
had
an
instant
sensation
of
absolute
fear
she
had
a
flashing
desire
to
turn
tail
and
run
out
of
the
room
but
the
same
power
which
had
pushed
her
into
the
room
now
sent
her
right
up
the
long
central
hall
past
all
the
watching
expectant
girls
outside
some
one
had
said
that
she
would
be
afraid
no
whatever
the
danger
she
knew
she
could
keep
her
own
she
was
not
kathleen
of
carrigrohane
castle
for
nothing
come
here
miss
said
the
voice
of
miss
ravenscroft
at
that
moment
kathleen
obeyed
at
once
she
found
a
seat
on
the
front
bench
dropped
into
it
and
at
the
same
moment
encountered
the
almost
malicious
glance
of
alice
tennant
she
turned
away
from
alice
that
look
seemed
suddenly
to
steady
her
nerves
she
was
afraid
just
for
a
moment
that
she
might
give
way
to
something
she
knew
not
what
but
alice
look
hardened
her
heart
time
had
been
given
kathleen
to
take
her
place
to
recover
any
emotion
she
might
have
felt
by
her
sudden
entrance
and
then
miss
ravenscroft
rose
to
her
feet
it
is
my
painful
duty
she
said
to
have
to
say
something
which
distresses
me
far
more
than
i
can
give
you
any
idea
of
my
dear
girls
you
have
all
been
summoned
to
attend
in
this
hall
in
order
to
meet
the
governors
of
the
school
miss
mackenzie
naylor
ross
the
misses
scott
and
miss
jane
smyth
these
ladies
have
come
to
meet
you
because
they
wish
thoroughly
to
investigate
a
most
disgraceful
matter
which
has
lately
been
going
on
in
the
school
miss
ravenscroft
paused
and
looked
round
her
i
allude
she
said
to
the
insurrection
in
our
midst
a
sort
of
civil
war
in
our
camp
there
are
i
am
given
to
understand
in
the
midst
of
this
hitherto
well
conducted
and
admirable
school
a
number
of
girls
who
have
banded
themselves
together
in
disregard
of
its
laws
and
who
have
made
for
themselves
laws
contrary
to
the
principles
of
this
great
school
and
noble
institution
who
meet
at
unseemly
hours
who
preach
rebellion
each
to
the
other
who
dare
to
publicly
break
the
laws
of
the
school
and
who
defy
the
express
wishes
of
myself
as
and
the
governors
of
the
school
by
insisting
on
continuing
their
wicked
meetings
and
last
night
a
certain
number
of
these
girls
actually
took
it
upon
themselves
to
go
to
london
to
do
what
i
say
and
to
return
at
midnight
alone
and
unchaperoned
such
conduct
is
so
unworthy
so
undignified
and
so
absolutely
sinful
that
there
is
only
one
course
to
pursue
the
girls
who
are
rebellious
in
the
school
must
be
exposed
their
conduct
must
be
investigated
and
a
very
heavy
punishment
awarded
to
them
here
miss
ravenscroft
looked
round
her
she
caught
the
eye
of
miss
mackenzie
who
beckoned
to
her
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
miss
mackenzie
bids
me
say
that
if
the
girls
who
belong
to
this
society
will
at
this
moment
give
up
the
name
of
their
ringleader
they
themselves
will
be
forgiven
what
punishment
they
receive
will
only
be
connected
with
their
work
in
the
school
and
may
possibly
exclude
them
from
competing
for
certain
scholarships
during
this
present
term
but
for
the
rest
nothing
further
will
be
said
but
it
is
essential
that
the
name
of
the
ringleader
as
well
as
her
rules
and
her
motives
should
be
declared
miss
ravenscroft
paused
again
and
looked
down
the
whole
length
of
the
long
hall
she
looked
to
right
and
left
do
let
any
girl
think
she
said
after
a
pause
that
she
is
acting
nobly
by
suppressing
information
which
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
school
i
do
not
ask
the
girls
who
are
spoken
of
as
the
paying
girls
to
expose
their
companions
nor
do
i
ask
those
foundationers
who
have
not
joined
the
band
of
insurgents
to
betray
their
fellows
but
what
i
do
ask
is
this
that
the
girls
themselves
the
rebels
should
rise
in
a
body
and
point
to
their
leader
with
that
leader
the
governors
will
deal
the
girls
themselves
will
have
forgiveness
miss
ravenscroft
again
paused
the
silence
which
followed
might
be
felt
susy
hopkins
bent
her
head
and
sobbed
janey
ford
trembled
all
over
and
clutched
tightly
the
hand
of
her
companion
but
no
one
spoke
it
was
at
that
moment
that
kathleen
calmly
and
slowly
raised
her
face
and
looked
around
her
she
looked
back
and
caught
the
eyes
of
at
least
a
dozen
of
those
foundationers
whom
she
had
pitied
and
helped
and
been
jolly
with
she
looked
to
the
right
then
and
met
as
many
more
faces
of
girls
whom
she
knew
and
who
were
members
of
the
wild
irish
girls
society
then
very
calmly
she
resumed
her
nonchalant
attitude
in
the
front
row
of
the
schoolgirls
miss
ravenscroft
meanwhile
stood
waiting
still
no
one
spoke
will
no
one
speak
she
said
will
no
girl
present
be
brave
enough
to
save
the
school
still
there
was
silence
this
is
a
very
good
and
a
great
school
said
miss
ravenscroft
it
gives
for
a
very
trifling
sum
an
education
worthy
of
the
very
best
and
most
expensive
schools
in
england
it
was
founded
some
hundred
years
ago
by
those
who
thought
much
and
in
advance
of
their
time
in
an
age
when
girls
were
almost
uneducated
when
nothing
further
was
required
from
them
than
a
smattering
of
reading
and
writing
these
wise
and
people
said
that
they
would
give
the
girls
of
the
future
a
chance
so
they
left
money
for
the
purpose
and
that
money
wisely
invested
has
borne
fruit
the
great
school
was
built
and
has
for
generations
helped
many
girls
who
otherwise
might
not
have
been
able
to
earn
their
own
bread
even
for
the
paying
girls
the
expense
for
all
they
receive
is
but
a
trifle
but
the
school
does
more
than
that
it
was
the
wish
of
the
founders
that
there
should
always
be
one
hundred
foundationers
on
the
school
lists
and
these
girls
are
admitted
free
they
pay
nothing
in
hard
cash
for
what
they
receive
they
are
taught
liberally
they
have
the
best
rooms
the
best
laboratories
the
best
music
the
best
art
are
supplied
to
them
if
they
have
talent
they
have
every
chance
of
bringing
it
to
the
fore
for
the
education
is
thorough
and
generous
but
the
school
does
even
more
than
this
it
opens
up
scholarships
many
scholarships
of
great
value
for
those
special
girls
who
call
themselves
foundationers
now
my
dear
girls
of
the
great
shirley
school
you
must
clearly
understand
that
no
establishment
of
this
kind
can
be
worked
except
on
certain
lines
and
these
lines
mean
order
method
and
obedience
rules
must
be
made
and
these
rules
at
any
cost
must
be
obeyed
these
rules
are
made
not
only
to
enable
the
girls
to
get
the
best
possible
education
out
of
the
school
but
also
that
the
greater
education
of
mind
and
heart
which
alone
can
build
up
a
fine
and
useful
character
may
not
be
neglected
that
sort
of
education
can
only
be
given
by
conforming
to
principles
now
there
are
certain
principles
which
every
girl
who
comes
into
this
school
is
bound
to
adhere
to
she
is
bound
on
all
occasions
to
behave
with
sobriety
with
a
sense
of
modesty
and
true
womanly
feeling
she
is
never
if
she
is
a
true
member
of
the
school
to
join
herself
to
rebels
who
do
not
believe
in
its
rules
now
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
society
which
you
girls
a
certain
number
of
you
have
joined
is
rebellious
has
bad
effects
and
has
rules
of
its
own
which
are
absolutely
contrary
to
the
rules
of
the
great
shirley
school
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
be
members
of
this
society
and
to
be
members
of
the
great
shirley
school
if
therefore
you
do
not
immediately
forsake
that
society
and
immediately
promise
here
and
now
that
you
will
give
it
up
forever
we
shall
have
the
painful
duty
of
expelling
you
from
the
school
you
have
a
few
minutes
in
which
to
decide
nobody
wants
to
be
hard
on
you
nobody
wants
to
be
hard
on
your
founder
although
she
must
no
longer
take
her
place
as
a
member
of
this
school
but
if
you
do
confess
very
stringent
and
terrible
methods
will
have
to
be
resorted
to
miss
ravenscroft
here
resumed
her
seat
there
was
a
faint
applause
which
came
from
different
parts
of
the
room
but
was
not
unanimous
and
soon
died
away
after
that
there
was
silence
miss
mackenzie
bent
forward
and
made
some
notes
in
a
little
black
book
which
she
held
upon
her
lap
naylor
took
her
handkerchief
and
wiped
the
tears
from
her
eyes
the
other
governors
looked
depressed
and
uneasy
meanwhile
miss
ravenscroft
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
different
girls
in
their
different
forms
there
was
no
movement
kathleen
drew
herself
up
proudly
they
not
quite
such
cads
she
said
under
her
breath
but
just
as
the
thought
came
to
her
miss
mackenzie
the
woman
most
respected
and
most
dreaded
in
the
whole
of
merrifield
rose
slowly
to
her
feet
girls
of
the
great
shirley
school
she
said
your
miss
ravenscroft
has
conveyed
to
you
a
message
from
me
and
from
the
other
governors
the
message
is
to
the
effect
that
if
those
silly
girls
who
have
allied
themselves
to
that
most
ridiculous
society
the
wild
irish
girls
will
give
the
name
of
their
leader
they
shall
be
forgiven
do
you
accept
foundationers
or
do
you
decline
dead
silence
ensued
i
presume
said
miss
mackenzie
after
a
pause
of
a
full
minute
that
your
silence
means
refusal
i
have
therefore
to
turn
to
a
certain
young
girl
in
this
school
who
was
a
member
of
the
wild
irish
girls
society
and
who
has
now
left
ruth
craven
have
the
goodness
to
step
forward
ruth
had
been
seated
in
the
fourth
bench
she
rose
slowly
kathleen
felt
a
curious
tremor
run
through
her
but
she
did
not
move
a
muscle
only
when
ruth
appeared
at
the
edge
of
the
platform
it
was
with
the
greatest
effort
she
could
keep
herself
from
jumping
up
taking
her
hand
and
mounting
the
platform
by
her
side
step
up
here
miss
craven
said
miss
mackenzie
ruth
did
so
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
stand
just
here
miss
craven
ruth
went
to
the
place
indicated
you
can
now
face
me
and
your
schoolfellows
can
also
see
girls
i
have
requested
ruth
craven
to
take
the
prominent
position
she
now
occupies
in
order
that
you
may
all
see
her
you
all
know
her
do
you
not
those
who
know
ruth
craven
hold
up
their
hands
immediately
there
was
a
great
show
of
uplifted
hands
i
presume
that
you
all
like
her
again
the
hands
went
up
and
kathleen
was
raised
the
highest
of
all
ruth
little
face
however
remained
perfectly
white
and
still
only
her
eyes
were
dark
with
emotion
she
kept
thinking
of
her
father
i
should
like
that
which
would
make
me
give
if
necessary
he
had
said
and
her
grandfather
had
said
sometimes
when
you
come
out
on
the
right
side
of
the
ledger
it
means
giving
that
you
possess
ruth
could
scarcely
see
the
faces
which
rose
up
like
a
great
ocean
beneath
her
but
she
remembered
her
father
words
very
distinctly
you
all
see
ruth
craven
continued
miss
mackenzie
as
far
as
i
know
she
is
a
good
girl
and
i
judge
by
your
method
of
answering
my
question
that
she
is
a
popular
girl
i
know
alas
that
she
is
poor
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
her
intellectual
endowments
and
believe
that
this
school
could
be
of
immense
advantage
to
her
i
believe
in
short
that
she
is
the
typical
sort
of
girl
of
whom
the
founders
thought
when
they
instituted
this
great
and
noble
house
of
learning
nevertheless
ruth
craven
must
fall
if
necessary
for
the
good
of
the
ruth
i
wish
to
ask
you
a
certain
question
you
were
a
member
of
that
rebellious
society
the
wild
irish
girls
yes
miss
mackenzie
ruth
yes
was
very
clear
her
face
looked
modest
but
firm
there
was
not
the
slightest
hesitation
in
the
words
she
uttered
her
speech
was
not
loud
but
it
could
be
heard
to
the
end
of
the
great
hall
you
are
no
longer
a
member
no
three
days
ago
i
and
the
other
governors
sent
for
you
to
ask
you
certain
questions
you
refused
to
answer
those
questions
then
we
gave
you
three
days
to
consider
telling
you
that
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
still
kept
to
your
resolution
there
was
only
one
thing
for
us
to
do
and
that
was
to
make
an
example
of
you
in
the
presence
of
the
entire
school
in
short
to
take
from
you
your
right
of
membership
and
to
expel
you
from
the
school
taking
from
you
all
privileges
all
chances
of
acquiring
learning
and
the
different
valuable
scholarships
which
this
school
was
opening
to
you
we
came
to
this
most
painful
resolve
knowing
well
that
it
would
cast
a
blight
upon
your
life
that
wherever
you
went
the
knowledge
that
you
had
been
publicly
expelled
from
the
great
shirley
school
would
follow
you
that
you
would
in
short
step
down
ruth
craven
i
quite
understand
from
the
expression
of
your
face
that
you
are
the
sort
of
child
who
imagines
that
she
is
doing
right
when
she
keeps
back
the
knowledge
which
she
thinks
she
ought
not
to
betray
but
we
governors
do
not
agree
with
you
there
are
six
of
us
here
and
we
wish
to
tell
you
that
if
you
now
refuse
the
information
which
we
wish
to
obtain
from
you
you
will
do
you
are
young
and
can
not
know
as
much
as
we
do
we
earnestly
beg
of
you
therefore
not
to
make
a
martyr
of
yourself
in
a
silly
and
ridiculous
mrs
naylor
will
you
now
say
what
you
think
to
ruth
craven
i
think
dear
child
said
naylor
speaking
in
a
tremulous
voice
which
could
scarcely
be
heard
down
the
room
that
it
would
be
best
for
you
not
to
conceal
the
truth
and
i
agree
said
ross
we
all
agree
said
the
misses
scott
and
miss
jane
smyth
we
all
think
dear
continued
naylor
that
for
the
sake
of
any
chivalrous
ideas
quite
worthy
in
themselves
it
is
a
considerable
pity
for
you
to
spoil
your
life
you
are
not
the
sort
of
child
who
could
stand
disgrace
and
you
do
look
the
sort
of
child
who
would
under
ordinary
circumstances
act
the
idiot
said
miss
mackenzie
sharply
as
to
the
chivalrous
nature
of
your
silence
i
fail
to
see
it
i
hope
you
have
carefully
considered
the
position
and
are
prepared
to
act
openly
and
honorably
by
go
doing
you
will
save
the
school
and
yourself
now
then
ruth
craven
will
you
come
a
little
more
forward
stand
just
girls
you
can
all
see
ruth
craven
can
you
not
the
girls
held
up
their
hands
in
token
that
they
could
i
will
therefore
at
once
proceed
to
question
her
continued
miss
mackenzie
there
was
just
a
moment
pause
and
during
that
complete
silence
a
dreadful
rushing
noise
came
into
kathleen
head
the
floor
for
an
instant
seemed
to
rise
up
as
though
it
would
strike
her
then
she
felt
composed
but
very
cold
and
white
she
fixed
her
eyes
full
on
ruth
i
will
hear
her
out
i
must
hear
the
thing
out
she
kept
saying
to
herself
afterwards
afterwards
but
i
must
hear
the
whole
thing
out
miss
mackenzie
turned
and
in
a
very
emphatic
voice
began
to
question
you
are
prepared
to
reply
to
the
following
questions
she
said
ruth
very
steady
eyes
were
raised
she
fixed
them
on
miss
mackenzie
her
lips
were
firmly
shut
nothing
could
be
quieter
than
her
attitude
she
did
not
show
a
trace
of
emotion
always
pale
she
looked
a
little
paler
now
than
her
wont
her
darks
eyes
seemed
to
darken
and
grow
full
of
intense
emotion
otherwise
no
one
could
have
told
that
she
was
suffering
or
feeling
anything
in
particular
but
i
know
what
she
is
going
through
thought
kathleen
she
clenched
her
hands
so
tightly
that
the
nails
went
into
the
delicate
flesh
she
was
glad
of
the
pain
it
kept
her
from
screaming
aloud
the
first
question
i
have
to
ask
said
miss
mackenzie
is
this
how
many
of
the
foundation
girls
have
joined
the
rebels
ruth
came
a
step
nearer
how
many
i
ca
quite
hear
you
i
am
sorry
said
ruth
then
but
i
ca
tell
you
miss
mackenzie
without
any
show
of
emotion
immediately
entered
answer
in
a
little
book
which
she
held
in
her
hand
oh
do
miss
mackenzie
do
be
harsh
gasped
little
naylor
miss
mackenzie
as
though
she
had
not
heard
the
voice
of
her
sister
governor
proceeded
what
is
the
name
of
the
founder
of
the
society
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
replied
ruth
again
this
answer
was
recorded
can
you
give
me
an
exact
account
of
the
rules
of
the
society
its
motives
its
bearing
generally
the
same
negative
reply
was
the
result
of
this
question
do
you
know
anything
whatever
of
the
disgraceful
escapade
which
took
place
last
night
when
a
certain
number
of
the
members
of
this
society
went
to
london
and
returned
by
themselves
at
midnight
ruth
face
cleared
a
little
at
this
question
i
can
not
answer
because
i
know
nothing
she
said
a
slight
look
of
relief
was
visible
on
the
faces
of
the
unfortunate
girls
who
had
gone
to
town
with
kathleen
on
the
preceding
night
a
few
more
questions
were
asked
ruth
replying
on
every
occasion
in
the
negative
i
ca
say
or
i
will
not
say
were
the
only
words
that
were
wrung
from
her
lips
in
short
said
miss
mackenzie
very
quietly
you
have
decided
ruth
craven
you
an
ignorant
silly
little
girl
to
defy
the
governors
of
this
school
all
justice
has
been
dealt
out
to
you
and
all
patience
the
consequence
of
your
mad
action
has
been
explained
to
you
with
the
utmost
fullness
you
have
been
given
time
abundant
time
to
consider
you
have
chosen
from
what
false
motives
it
is
impossible
to
say
my
dear
interrupted
naylor
the
child
means
well
i
am
assured
from
what
false
motives
it
is
impossible
to
say
continued
miss
mackenzie
not
taking
the
slightest
notice
of
the
little
futile
appeal
you
have
decided
to
wreck
your
own
life
and
to
ruin
the
school
it
was
to
have
been
your
noble
privilege
to
save
the
school
in
a
time
of
extremity
you
have
chosen
the
unworthy
course
it
is
therefore
my
painful
duty
to
call
upon
miss
ravenscroft
as
to
expel
you
ruth
craven
from
this
school
you
are
no
longer
a
member
of
the
great
shirley
school
you
are
hold
cried
kathleen
her
voice
rang
out
sharp
and
clear
it
was
heard
all
over
the
school
and
was
so
imperative
so
startling
so
unexpected
that
even
miss
mackenzie
lost
her
and
fell
back
in
silence
hold
cried
kathleen
again
you
have
said
enough
i
do
think
you
ought
to
go
on
you
are
torturing
the
noblest
girl
in
the
world
but
kathleen
bad
as
she
is
can
not
endure
this
last
insult
girls
wild
irish
girls
you
who
belong
to
my
society
i
as
your
queen
desire
you
to
come
forward
come
forward
in
a
body
at
once
what
was
there
in
the
young
voice
that
impelled
what
was
there
in
the
young
face
that
stimulated
that
caused
fear
to
slink
out
of
sight
and
courage
to
come
to
the
fore
that
caused
hearts
to
beat
high
with
generous
emotion
not
a
single
girl
failed
kathleen
in
this
moment
of
her
appeal
they
clambered
over
their
seats
they
bent
under
the
forms
they
got
out
in
any
fashion
until
she
was
surrounded
by
the
sixty
girls
who
formed
her
society
she
glanced
round
her
her
eyes
grew
full
of
sweetness
and
there
was
a
look
on
her
face
which
made
the
girls
for
the
moment
feel
that
they
would
die
for
her
come
girls
said
their
queen
come
there
is
room
on
the
platform
she
sprang
up
the
couple
of
steps
without
another
word
and
the
girls
followed
her
do
what
you
like
with
ruth
craven
miss
mackenzie
she
cried
but
put
your
questions
over
again
to
me
and
i
will
answer
them
one
after
the
other
then
expel
me
and
my
companions
turn
us
out
of
the
school
but
keep
the
girl
who
would
be
a
credit
to
you
chapter
xxix
end
of
the
great
rebellion
no
one
quite
knew
what
happened
next
some
of
the
girls
went
off
into
violent
hysterics
others
rushed
out
of
the
great
hall
while
others
controlled
themselves
and
listened
as
best
they
could
the
scene
was
vivid
and
picturesque
naylor
sobbed
quite
audibly
and
took
hold
of
ruth
hand
and
even
kissed
it
but
as
she
did
so
kathleen
herself
came
near
and
flung
her
arm
round
ruth
neck
if
you
mean
to
expel
ruth
you
will
expel
me
she
said
but
wo
you
forgive
her
if
her
ideas
were
wrong
they
were
at
least
generous
and
you
know
that
i
wo
trouble
you
any
more
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
think
that
i
was
made
to
suit
a
great
school
like
this
and
i
give
up
the
society
yes
absolutely
so
you
wo
have
any
rebels
present
in
your
midst
again
expel
me
but
keep
her
for
she
will
be
the
flower
of
your
school
the
greatest
ornament
one
you
will
talk
of
in
the
dim
years
of
the
future
do
let
me
feel
that
i
have
spoilt
her
life
but
why
did
you
act
so
kathleen
said
miss
mackenzie
why
did
you
a
silly
young
girl
come
over
here
a
stranger
to
ruin
the
school
and
make
us
all
unhappy
i
ca
answer
you
that
said
kathleen
flinging
out
her
hands
i
did
what
i
was
made
to
do
i
am
a
rebel
by
nature
i
believe
i
shall
always
be
a
rebel
i
shall
go
home
to
father
and
mother
and
tell
them
i
am
not
suited
for
a
school
like
this
but
do
expel
ruth
and
do
expel
the
others
but
we
will
all
go
if
you
are
not
kept
suddenly
cried
one
of
the
sixty
kathleen
never
quite
knew
which
and
suddenly
one
girl
after
another
began
to
speak
up
for
her
and
all
promised
that
if
kathleen
were
allowed
to
remain
and
if
the
whole
story
of
the
great
rebellion
was
allowed
to
blow
over
they
would
work
as
they
had
never
done
before
they
wanted
their
queen
to
stay
with
them
would
the
governors
forgive
their
queen
just
because
she
was
an
irish
girl
and
like
no
one
else
how
it
came
to
pass
it
was
impossible
to
tell
there
was
something
about
kathleen
the
bold
bright
and
yet
generous
look
on
her
face
the
love
which
darted
out
of
her
eyes
when
she
grasped
ruth
hand
that
even
impressed
miss
mackenzie
she
said
after
a
pause
that
she
was
willing
to
reconsider
matters
and
that
she
and
all
the
other
governors
would
meet
in
a
day
or
two
to
give
their
opinion
thus
the
school
broke
up
it
had
lived
through
its
greatest
and
most
exciting
hour
but
when
kathleen
was
seen
going
through
the
gates
her
arm
flung
round
ruth
waist
and
all
the
sixty
girls
following
at
her
heels
such
a
cheer
went
up
from
the
anxious
mothers
and
fathers
and
brothers
for
many
fresh
people
had
come
to
swell
the
crowd
since
kathleen
entered
the
school
as
was
never
heard
before
in
merrifield
thus
ended
the
great
rebellion
it
is
spoken
of
to
this
day
as
the
greatest
and
most
conspicuous
event
in
the
school
history
for
after
all
the
governors
were
lenient
and
no
girl
was
expelled
kathleen
as
years
went
on
became
far
and
away
the
most
popular
girl
in
the
school
her
talents
were
of
the
most
brilliant
order
her
very
faults
seemed
in
one
way
to
add
to
her
charms
in
one
sense
she
was
always
a
more
or
less
troublesome
girl
but
where
she
loved
she
loved
deeply
and
from
that
hour
she
gave
up
all
thought
of
rebellion
either
against
the
governors
or
against
miss
ravenscroft
ruth
was
kathleen
greatest
friend
her
grandfather
got
better
his
heart
was
never
broken
by
the
knowledge
of
that
terrible
disgrace
which
the
child
so
feared
that
she
would
bring
him
church
became
one
of
the
irish
and
grumbled
a
good
deal
at
the
change
in
her
position
hopkins
debt
was
cleared
off
and
all
the
characters
in
this
story
did
well
and
were
proud
to
admit
that
they
owed
most
of
their
future
prosperity
to
the
wild
irish
girl
