all
the
clocks
of
the
great
thronged
city
clanged
out
the
hour
of
midnight
from
their
hoarse
brazen
throats
simultaneously
and
as
the
last
tremulous
echo
died
away
on
the
air
a
human
soul
that
had
wasted
its
glorious
talents
and
squandered
its
heritage
of
genius
in
a
reckless
dissipated
life
was
launched
out
on
the
great
shoreless
tide
of
eternity
and
in
the
same
moment
of
time
a
young
fair
innocent
girl
the
dead
man
only
child
was
cast
adrift
friendless
and
forlorn
upon
the
mercies
of
the
cold
hard
world
she
fell
like
one
dead
by
the
bedside
and
the
wealth
of
her
burnished
golden
hair
fell
like
a
pitying
veil
over
the
slender
form
that
had
bent
like
a
flower
before
the
relentless
blast
of
fate
the
coarse
but
not
unkindly
lodging
house
people
bore
her
into
her
own
little
room
and
left
her
there
alone
to
recover
while
they
prepared
the
dead
man
for
burial
it
was
but
a
little
while
that
this
blessed
unconsciousness
lasted
when
laurel
vane
struggled
up
to
her
feet
to
push
back
with
little
trembling
hands
the
cloud
of
golden
hair
from
her
white
brow
and
stare
with
great
frightened
somber
eyes
out
into
the
strange
unknown
future
what
terrible
temptation
what
love
and
sorrow
and
bitter
despair
that
future
held
in
its
keeping
for
her
was
yet
mercifully
hidden
from
her
sight
by
the
thick
curtain
of
mystery
that
ever
hides
from
our
curious
eyes
the
daughter
of
a
genius
who
had
beclouded
his
gifted
brain
with
the
fumes
of
strong
drink
and
who
had
only
written
his
brilliant
articles
under
the
stress
of
compulsion
and
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
the
girl
realized
that
she
was
left
alone
and
penniless
with
not
a
friend
to
pity
or
protect
her
it
came
over
her
suddenly
and
with
a
great
thrill
of
horror
that
her
father
last
article
finished
only
yesterday
before
that
sudden
illness
laid
its
chilly
fatal
hand
upon
him
must
be
carried
to
the
publishing
house
and
the
money
received
therefor
before
she
could
bury
her
dead
her
dead
she
could
scarcely
realize
that
her
fond
though
erring
father
the
profound
scholar
the
erratic
genius
who
had
loved
his
little
girl
even
while
he
had
unpardonably
neglected
her
was
gone
from
her
for
evermore
with
trembling
footsteps
she
glided
to
the
room
where
the
people
having
robed
him
for
the
grave
had
left
him
alone
in
the
solemn
majesty
of
death
a
terrible
shudder
shook
her
frame
as
she
beheld
that
sheeted
lying
in
stiff
rigid
outline
upon
the
narrow
bed
half
frightened
she
drew
back
the
snowy
linen
and
gazed
upon
the
handsome
features
to
whose
pallid
grace
death
had
added
a
solemn
dignity
all
its
own
great
bursting
sobs
of
regret
and
sorrow
shook
the
daughter
frame
as
she
gazed
on
that
loved
face
where
in
life
the
stamp
of
genius
had
been
marred
by
the
traces
of
dissipation
and
vulgar
pleasures
laurel
was
little
more
than
a
child
yet
she
knew
that
her
father
had
recklessly
wasted
his
talents
and
sated
his
soul
on
the
dry
husks
of
life
yet
in
all
her
sorrow
and
pity
in
all
her
fear
of
the
untried
future
no
thought
of
anger
or
blame
came
to
her
as
she
kept
her
sorrowful
vigil
by
his
side
there
were
others
who
blamed
him
that
he
had
left
this
tender
flower
his
laurel
blossom
as
he
poetically
called
her
alone
and
penniless
in
the
hard
cold
world
but
she
his
daughter
had
nothing
but
tears
and
love
for
him
now
when
he
lay
before
her
dead
in
a
few
hours
they
would
carry
him
away
her
beloved
forever
out
of
her
sight
but
even
those
last
few
hours
she
could
not
have
to
spend
with
him
she
was
too
forlorn
and
poor
to
give
herself
these
last
moments
with
him
she
must
carry
his
last
manuscript
to
the
office
and
receive
the
money
before
she
could
pay
for
his
coffin
and
hearse
and
already
the
keepers
were
adjuring
her
to
hasten
in
burying
him
it
was
so
gloomy
having
a
corpse
in
the
house
they
said
unfeelingly
so
at
the
earliest
office
hours
laurel
presented
herself
at
the
editor
desk
with
the
small
roll
of
manuscript
clasped
tightly
in
her
little
black
gloved
hand
the
clerk
stared
almost
rudely
at
the
young
face
from
which
she
put
aside
the
shielding
veil
with
one
timid
hand
a
little
beauty
if
only
she
were
so
pale
and
was
his
mental
comment
i
have
brought
vane
article
for
the
magazine
can
i
have
the
money
for
it
now
she
asked
falteringly
very
sorry
but
the
editor
is
in
you
may
leave
the
paper
and
vane
can
call
for
his
money
later
in
the
day
replied
the
clerk
devouring
her
sweet
face
with
his
bold
admiring
eyes
the
red
mouth
trembled
the
wide
somber
dark
eyes
brimmed
over
with
quick
tears
he
he
can
not
come
he
is
dead
she
answered
in
uneven
tones
and
flushing
crimson
in
a
sensitive
shame
at
her
own
poverty
i
must
have
the
money
to
bury
him
ah
dead
very
sorry
i
sure
said
the
clerk
a
little
startled
out
of
his
coolness
and
you
are
his
daughter
yes
i
am
laurel
vane
the
editor
does
come
down
to
his
office
till
noon
he
always
examines
articles
and
pays
for
them
himself
very
sorry
your
father
is
dead
a
fine
writer
when
he
chose
to
take
up
the
pen
can
i
do
anything
else
for
you
miss
vane
went
on
the
young
man
rather
pitying
her
sorrow
and
timidity
inasmuch
as
she
was
fair
to
look
upon
if
you
will
give
me
the
address
i
will
go
to
gordon
private
residence
i
must
have
the
money
without
delay
she
answered
faintly
he
scribbled
the
address
on
a
card
for
her
and
after
bowing
her
out
in
his
most
killing
air
he
went
back
to
tell
the
printers
that
old
vane
had
drunk
himself
to
death
at
last
and
left
a
devilish
pretty
little
daughter
without
a
penny
with
a
name
as
pretty
as
her
face
laurel
vane
he
added
he
might
have
had
a
prouder
laurel
for
his
brow
than
a
penniless
daughter
if
he
had
not
been
so
fond
of
his
glass
said
the
printers
grimly
and
this
was
louis
vane
epitaph
while
laurel
directed
her
faltering
steps
to
the
editor
residence
all
unconscious
that
the
finger
of
fate
was
pointing
the
way
gordon
was
one
of
the
most
successful
editors
and
publishers
of
the
day
and
his
house
on
one
of
the
fashionable
avenues
of
the
great
city
looked
like
a
palace
to
laurel
unaccustomed
eyes
she
went
slowly
up
the
broad
steps
and
rang
the
bell
a
little
nervously
feeling
her
courage
desert
her
at
thought
of
the
interview
with
the
stern
editor
no
thought
came
to
her
that
her
first
meeting
with
that
august
personage
would
be
in
a
darker
more
fateful
hour
than
this
the
smart
who
opened
the
door
stared
at
our
simply
clad
heroine
a
little
superciliously
he
could
not
recognize
a
lady
apart
from
a
fine
dress
i
wish
to
see
gordon
please
laurel
said
with
quiet
dignity
gordon
is
out
mem
was
the
disappointing
reply
where
is
he
gone
when
will
he
come
back
exclaimed
laurel
in
piteous
disappointment
he
gone
into
the
country
and
he
wo
be
back
until
was
the
concise
reply
the
day
was
warm
but
the
girl
shivered
as
if
the
ground
had
been
swept
from
beneath
her
feet
by
the
icy
blast
of
winter
an
unconscious
cry
broke
from
her
quivering
lips
and
she
clasped
her
little
hands
tightly
together
oh
what
shall
i
do
now
she
moaned
despairingly
i
sure
i
do
know
mem
said
the
man
impudently
and
making
an
impatient
move
to
shut
the
door
in
her
face
he
might
have
done
so
with
impunity
for
laurel
gazing
before
her
with
dazed
despairing
gaze
was
for
the
moment
incapable
of
speech
or
action
but
at
that
moment
a
door
opened
sharply
on
the
side
of
the
hall
a
swish
of
silk
sounded
softly
and
a
clear
sweet
voice
inquired
who
is
that
asking
for
papa
charles
charles
opened
the
door
and
fell
back
obsequiously
a
lovely
girl
richly
dressed
came
toward
laurel
i
am
gordon
daughter
is
your
business
important
she
inquired
with
girlish
curiosity
she
thought
she
had
never
seen
anything
so
sweet
and
sad
as
the
dark
wistful
eyes
laurel
flashed
upward
to
meet
her
gaze
oh
yes
yes
it
is
very
important
she
faltered
incoherently
perhaps
you
could
that
is
if
you
would
miss
gordon
smiled
a
little
at
the
tripping
speech
but
not
unkindly
come
in
i
will
do
what
i
can
she
said
and
led
laurel
past
the
discomfited
charles
into
a
lovely
little
anteroom
with
flowers
and
books
and
pictures
that
made
it
a
little
feminine
paradise
she
pushed
a
little
cushioned
chair
toward
laurel
sit
down
and
tell
me
what
you
want
of
papa
she
said
gently
and
laurel
impulsive
heart
went
out
in
a
great
flood
of
gratitude
to
this
beautiful
stranger
who
looked
and
spoke
so
sweetly
she
grasped
the
back
of
the
chair
tightly
with
both
hands
and
turned
her
dark
beseeching
eyes
on
miss
gordon
face
i
have
brought
vane
manuscript
for
the
magazine
she
added
he
my
papa
is
dead
she
added
with
a
rush
of
bitter
tears
and
we
are
so
poor
i
must
have
the
money
to
pay
for
his
funeral
instantly
beatrix
gordon
drew
out
her
dainty
pearl
you
poor
child
she
said
compassionately
what
is
the
price
of
the
article
laurel
named
it
and
miss
gordon
counted
the
money
out
into
the
little
trembling
hand
and
received
the
manuscript
i
am
very
sorry
vane
is
dead
she
said
he
was
a
very
gifted
writer
has
he
left
you
all
alone
my
poor
girl
with
gentle
compassion
all
alone
laurel
echoed
drearily
then
suddenly
she
caught
miss
gordon
hand
and
covered
it
with
tears
and
kisses
you
have
been
so
kind
and
so
noble
to
me
that
i
will
do
anything
on
earth
for
you
miss
gordon
she
sobbed
out
gratefully
then
she
hurried
away
to
bury
her
dead
little
thinking
in
what
way
beatrix
gordon
would
claim
her
promise
chapter
ii
come
in
said
laurel
faintly
in
answer
to
the
sharp
rap
at
the
door
the
cheap
plain
funeral
was
over
and
the
orphan
sat
alone
in
the
deepening
twilight
in
the
shabby
little
room
now
invested
with
a
somber
dignity
all
its
own
since
the
presence
of
death
had
so
lately
been
there
laurel
head
was
bowed
upon
her
hands
and
tears
coursed
slowly
each
one
a
scalding
drop
of
woe
down
her
white
cheeks
the
door
opened
and
the
woman
from
whom
vane
had
rented
the
two
shabby
little
rooms
entered
abruptly
she
was
a
coarse
creature
devoid
of
sympathy
or
sensibility
she
looked
coldly
at
the
weeping
girl
the
rent
due
miss
vane
she
said
roughly
have
you
got
the
money
to
pay
it
laurel
silently
counted
over
the
contents
of
her
slim
purse
here
is
the
money
groves
and
it
is
the
last
cent
i
have
on
earth
she
said
drearily
as
she
placed
the
silver
in
the
greedy
outstretched
hand
is
that
so
then
of
course
you
not
be
wanting
the
rooms
any
longer
i
will
trouble
you
to
move
out
early
in
the
morning
so
i
may
rent
them
to
somebody
else
exclaimed
groves
laurel
sprung
to
her
feet
in
dismay
a
terrified
look
on
her
fair
young
face
oh
madam
i
have
nowhere
to
go
so
soon
she
cried
out
pleadingly
perhaps
you
will
let
me
keep
the
one
little
room
until
i
can
find
work
i
will
be
sure
to
pay
you
i
ca
depend
on
no
such
uncertain
prospects
declared
groves
unfeelingly
i
got
to
be
pretty
certain
where
my
money
coming
from
before
i
rent
my
rooms
so
out
you
go
in
the
morning
and
if
you
do
leave
quietly
i
have
your
trunk
hoisted
out
on
the
sidewalk
in
a
jiffy
so
there
with
this
emphatic
threat
the
rude
landlady
banged
herself
out
of
the
room
and
laurel
sunk
down
with
a
low
moan
of
terror
upon
the
floor
she
was
no
coward
reader
this
forlorn
little
heroine
of
ours
but
she
knew
scarcely
more
of
the
wide
world
outside
her
cheap
than
a
baby
she
had
lived
in
one
poor
place
or
another
with
her
erratic
father
all
her
life
keeping
their
poor
little
rooms
with
untaught
skill
meagerly
supported
by
his
neglected
talent
and
with
not
an
idea
of
how
to
earn
her
own
living
vane
had
educated
her
after
his
own
desultory
fashion
but
not
in
a
practical
way
that
she
could
utilize
now
in
her
need
she
wondered
with
a
shudder
of
dread
what
she
should
do
and
where
she
should
go
when
she
was
turned
out
into
the
streets
of
which
she
felt
horribly
afraid
and
which
her
father
had
seldom
permitted
her
to
traverse
alone
she
pushed
open
the
casement
and
looked
out
night
had
fallen
and
under
the
glare
of
the
gaslight
laurel
saw
wicked
men
and
ribald
women
tramping
the
streets
night
she
would
be
out
on
the
horrible
pavements
among
them
with
nowhere
to
go
and
not
a
friend
in
all
the
wide
wicked
city
perhaps
they
would
murder
her
these
wolves
of
the
street
when
she
was
cast
out
like
a
helpless
white
lamb
astray
from
the
fold
shivering
she
recalled
some
verses
she
had
somewhere
read
they
seemed
to
fit
her
own
forlorn
strait
where
the
lamps
quiver
so
far
in
the
river
with
many
a
light
from
window
and
casement
from
garret
to
basement
she
stood
with
amazement
houseless
by
night
oh
what
shall
i
do
she
moaned
tremblingly
it
were
a
thousand
times
better
papa
if
i
had
died
with
you
the
room
door
opened
suddenly
and
without
warning
and
groves
reappeared
here
a
young
man
asking
for
you
miss
vane
he
tell
you
how
to
make
a
honest
living
now
your
pa
dead
she
said
with
a
coarse
significant
chuckle
she
hustled
the
visitor
across
the
threshold
and
closing
the
door
stumped
loudly
down
the
passage
but
returned
in
a
moment
on
to
play
the
eavesdropper
the
room
was
all
in
darkness
save
for
the
gaslight
that
streamed
through
the
open
window
laurel
turned
quickly
to
light
her
little
lamp
wondering
who
her
visitor
might
be
to
her
amazement
she
saw
the
rather
and
clerk
she
had
met
at
the
that
morning
good
evening
miss
vane
he
said
insinuatingly
i
ventured
to
call
thinking
that
you
might
need
a
friend
the
quick
instinct
of
purity
took
alarm
in
laurel
breast
she
drew
back
coldly
as
he
offered
her
his
smooth
white
hand
i
needed
a
friend
this
morning
but
you
did
not
seem
to
remember
it
then
she
said
scathingly
i
ah
oh
i
was
taken
by
surprise
then
i
had
not
my
wits
about
me
he
stammered
disconcerted
pray
pardon
my
forgetfulness
i
have
been
thinking
about
you
all
day
and
wishing
i
could
help
you
here
is
my
card
pray
command
my
services
laurel
took
the
bit
of
pasteboard
and
read
the
name
written
on
it
in
smooth
it
was
ross
powell
the
young
man
had
seated
himself
meanwhile
with
the
coolest
laurel
looked
at
him
with
her
great
wistful
dark
eyes
do
you
really
mean
what
you
say
she
inquired
a
faint
ring
of
hope
in
her
dejected
voice
yes
i
infer
that
your
father
has
left
you
without
means
of
support
and
i
wish
to
offer
you
a
good
situation
powell
replied
suavely
with
a
sparkle
in
his
bold
gray
eyes
the
girl
clasped
her
little
hands
impulsively
together
hope
and
fear
struggled
together
on
her
fair
young
face
but
i
do
know
how
to
do
anything
she
cried
ingenuously
i
have
never
been
to
school
like
other
girls
i
always
kept
papa
rooms
and
mended
his
clothes
and
made
my
own
dresses
but
i
could
do
anything
like
that
well
enough
for
any
one
else
ross
powell
gray
eyes
sparkled
wickedly
he
kept
the
lids
drooped
over
them
that
laurel
might
not
see
their
evil
gleam
oh
yes
you
could
he
exclaimed
i
know
some
one
who
wants
a
little
housekeeper
just
like
you
to
keep
two
beautiful
rooms
in
order
as
you
did
for
your
father
will
you
come
laurel
who
is
the
person
she
inquired
flushing
sensitively
at
his
familiar
utterance
of
her
name
ross
powell
moved
his
chair
to
laurel
side
and
gazed
deep
into
her
beautiful
wondering
dark
eyes
the
person
is
myself
he
replied
in
low
tones
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
you
my
beautiful
little
laurel
and
i
want
you
to
come
and
be
my
little
fairy
housekeeper
i
will
love
and
cherish
you
as
the
darling
of
my
heart
laurel
regarded
him
a
moment
in
blank
silence
there
was
a
look
of
genuine
perplexity
on
her
innocent
face
she
spoke
at
length
in
a
low
doubtful
tone
are
you
asking
me
to
be
your
wife
sir
was
her
question
he
flushed
and
looked
rather
abashed
at
the
innocent
question
why
no
my
dear
not
exactly
he
answered
regaining
his
in
a
moment
i
do
wish
to
saddle
myself
with
a
wife
yet
but
it
would
be
about
the
same
thing
i
would
worship
you
my
beautiful
laurel
and
you
should
have
fine
dresses
and
jewels
visit
the
theaters
and
operas
live
in
beautiful
rooms
while
i
your
adoring
slave
stop
ross
powell
she
had
stood
like
one
turned
to
stone
gazing
and
listening
for
a
moment
but
now
her
young
voice
rang
like
a
clarion
through
the
room
stop
ross
powell
he
sprung
from
his
seat
and
moving
to
her
side
attempted
to
take
her
hand
she
tore
it
from
him
and
struck
him
an
ignominious
slap
in
the
face
with
that
small
white
member
her
eyes
blazed
her
cheeks
burned
she
crossed
to
the
door
and
threw
it
open
so
suddenly
that
groves
was
disclosed
in
the
act
of
listening
but
laurel
paid
no
heed
to
her
as
she
shuffled
away
crestfallen
and
for
once
ashamed
of
herself
the
flashing
eyes
of
the
girl
seemed
to
wither
the
villain
where
he
stood
gazing
sullenly
upon
her
with
the
red
mark
of
that
frantic
blow
upon
his
face
go
ross
powell
she
said
pointing
a
disdainful
finger
at
him
go
and
may
the
good
god
in
heaven
punish
you
doubly
and
trebly
for
this
dastardly
outrage
on
an
unprotected
girl
he
slunk
across
the
threshold
like
the
base
coward
that
he
was
but
out
in
the
narrow
passage
he
turned
and
looked
back
at
her
with
a
malevolent
glare
on
his
face
you
have
made
an
enemy
laurel
vane
he
hissed
i
would
have
given
you
love
and
protection
but
you
have
chosen
my
hatred
instead
i
shall
not
forget
you
i
shall
always
remember
that
blow
in
my
face
and
i
shall
have
my
revenge
for
it
look
well
to
your
future
my
beautiful
fury
laurel
slammed
and
locked
the
door
in
the
face
of
the
angry
wretch
and
fell
upon
the
floor
again
giving
vent
to
her
outraged
feelings
in
a
storm
of
passionate
tears
but
it
seemed
as
though
she
were
not
destined
to
have
any
peace
or
quiet
that
evening
again
a
rap
sounded
on
the
door
she
brushed
away
her
falling
tears
and
opened
it
in
fear
and
trembling
a
smart
pretty
girl
was
her
visitor
this
time
i
am
miss
gordon
maid
said
the
newcomer
and
she
slipped
a
perfumed
little
envelope
into
laurel
hand
laurel
opened
it
and
read
with
bewildered
eyes
my
dear
little
laurel
i
wish
to
see
you
very
much
but
there
are
reasons
why
i
can
not
come
to
you
so
i
have
sent
my
maid
clarice
to
bring
you
to
me
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
all
day
and
of
your
sweet
promise
to
do
anything
on
earth
for
me
i
believe
that
we
can
mutually
help
each
other

quickly

no
fear
but
that
clarice
will
guide
you
safely
to
me
your
friend
beatrix
gordon
will
you
come
miss
vane
asked
the
pretty
maid
intelligently
yes
laurel
answered
hopefully
and
so
went
forth
to
her
future
chapter
iii
one
of
the
most
magnificent
of
the
many
palace
homes
that
adorn
the
glorious
hudson
river
belonged
to
leon
le
roy
it
was
a
beautiful
picturesque
structure
with
graceful
towers
projecting
oriel
windows
charming
balconies
and
marble
steps
that
led
down
into
spacious
grounds
so
beautifully
laid
out
that
one
never
wearied
of
the
miniature
lakes
the
sparkling
fountains
the
splendid
shrubbery
the
rare
flowers
and
the
costly
statuary
that
dotted
the
velvety
green
lawns
that
sloped
down
to
the
water
edge
it
was
a
miniature
paradise
without
and
the
interior
of
the
dwelling
was
no
less
beautiful
and
tasteful
cultured
taste
and
rare
refinement
had
united
with
great
wealth
to
make
it
a
complete
and
perfect
ideal
of
a
home
perhaps
the
first
leon
le
roy
when
he
had
built
this
beautiful
home
and
carried
his
blooming
bride
there
had
not
been
far
wrong
when
he
called
it
eden
whether
he
had
found
it
a
veritable
eden
mattered
little
to
him
now
he
had
passed
to
his
rest
in
the
land
that
is
fairer
than
day
and
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
a
king
by
right
of
his
imperious
will
and
worshiped
blindly
by
the
his
mother
he
was
tall
dark
and
stately
with
an
almost
godlike
beauty
marred
somewhat
by
an
expression
of
cynicism
coldness
and
pride
all
curiously
blended
together
he
was
past
the
prime
of
youth
being
about
and
his
varied
experience
of
men
and
things
had
left
cold
distrustful
lines
about
his
firm
mustached
lips
and
a
mocking
light
in
his
proud
dark
eyes
an
impatient
discontent
rested
on
his
handsome
features
as
he
sat
in
a
beautiful
with
his
mother
the
second
day
after
the
beginning
of
this
story
the
handsome
richly
dressed
old
lady
was
reading
aloud
from
a
letter
that
had
just
been
received
with
the
morning
mail
my
dear
mrs
le
roy
i
am
in
a
dilemma
and
i
turn
to
you
my
old
friend
although
i
have
not
seen
you
in
many
years
believing
that
you
will
aid
and
abet
me
in
my
innocent
scheme
my
daughter
beatrix
has
formed
a
foolish
engagement
with
a
young
man
of
small
income
and
no
prospects
she
is
both
beautiful
and
accomplished
and
as
the
sole
heiress
of
her
father
wealth
i
can
not
endure
to
see
her
become
the
prey
of
a
designing
my
plan
is
to
separate
them
by
sending
beatrix
away
from
the
city
and
getting
rid
of
her
lover
by
some
clever
scheme
before
she
returns
if
possible
gordon
will
have
him
sent
to
europe
i
would
like
to
send
the
wretch
to
kamtchatka
if
i
could
on
some
lucrative
mission
both
our
hearts
are
deeply
set
on
this
plan
indeed
delicate
invalid
as
i
am
my
nerves
are
so
unstrung
by
this
affair
that
i
feel
i
shall
perish
unless
i
can
rescue
my
child
from
this
undesirable
entanglement
and
now
dear
mrs
le
roy
for
your
share
in
our
little
scheme
i
know
that
during
the
absence
of
your
son
in
europe
you
are
leading
a
quiet
retired
life
at
your
beautiful
home
on
the
hudson
i
wish
to
have
beatrix
visit
you
for
a
few
months
while
we
get
her
obnoxious
lover
out
of
the
way
for
good
so
sure
am
i
of
your
consent
that
i
have
pretended
to
beatrix
that
you
have
already
invited
her
and
on
the
day
after
i
shall
send
her
down
to
eden
in
care
of
her
maid
i
would
accompany
her
myself
only
that
i
am
a
confirmed
invalid
my
dear
friend
you
must
take
the
best
care
of
my
treasure
see
that
she
sends
no
letters
to
any
one
but
her
father
or
me
allow
no
stranger
to
visit
her
i
depend
hopefully
on
your
in
this
matter
for
my
daughter
is
a
fitting
mate
for
the
best
and
i
will
not
sacrifice
her
to
a
poor
man
you
will
pardon
my
prolix
letter
for
the
sake
of
a
mother
anxiety
yours
isabel
gordon
she
closed
the
letter
and
looked
up
at
leon
who
stood
in
the
embrasure
of
a
window
gazing
carelessly
out
at
the
beautiful
grounds
a
mocking
sneer
curled
his
thin
lips
as
he
returned
to
her
a
scheming
woman
of
the
world
he
said
sententiously
i
hope
you
will
not
lend
yourself
to
her
iniquitous
plan
mrs
le
roy
glanced
at
her
letter
again
you
see
she
really
gives
me
no
chance
for
refusing
simply
taking
my
consent
for
granted
she
said
dubiously
no
matter
write
her
that
you
can
not
receive
miss
beatrix
tell
her
i
came
home
yesterday
and
that
i
am
an
ogre
who
would
frighten
her
beauty
away
what
is
all
the
peace
of
my
to
be
marred
by
the
coming
of
a
romantic
girl
he
exclaimed
i
will
write
her
not
to
come
then
leon
but
heavens
look
at
the
date
of
this
letter
it
has
miscarried
she
should
be
here
exclaimed
the
lady
nervously
telegraph
her
then
anything
only
keep
the
girl
away
exclaimed
le
roy
testily
i
will
do
so
immediately
leon
exclaimed
his
mother
all
in
a
flutter
that
was
quite
unusual
to
her
dignity
but
fate
is
above
us
all
at
this
moment
a
trained
obsequious
servant
opened
the
door
and
announced
respectfully
chapter
iv
the
agitated
lady
and
her
haughty
handsome
son
both
looked
at
the
door
with
an
irrepressible
start
a
sixteen
year
old
girl
was
wavering
on
the
threshold
staring
into
the
elegant
room
and
at
the
cold
curious
faces
of
the
mother
and
son
with
parted
lips
and
large
somber
frightened
dark
eyes
over
the
simple
short
traveling
dress
of
plain
material
her
rich
burnished
golden
hair
flowed
in
billows
of
brightness
beneath
the
wide
brim
of
her
simple
hat
a
neat
pretty
maid
hovered
in
the
background
looking
far
more
cool
and
than
her
lovely
young
mistress
leon
le
roy
quick
eyes
caught
and
held
for
a
moment
the
gaze
of
those
startled
ones
he
saw
a
pale
pure
face
exquisitely
molded
with
perfect
features
save
as
he
said
to
himself
her
nose
was
a
trifle
too
short
and
her
lips
too
full
but
then
the
defect
of
her
nose
lent
character
to
her
face
and
the
pouting
lips
showed
tenderness
a
baby
face
he
said
to
himself
disdainfully
noting
the
quiver
of
the
lips
that
trembled
like
a
child
about
to
cry
the
girl
dark
eyes
turned
quickly
from
that
haughty
handsome
face
as
if
in
fear
and
sought
comfort
in
the
woman
but
it
was
cold
and
haughty
too
there
was
no
welcome
on
it
save
what
cold
conventional
courtesy
required
she
advanced
and
gave
the
newcomer
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
the
side
of
her
cheek
to
kiss
welcome
to
eden
miss
gordon
she
said
chillingly
and
then
she
led
her
up
to
her
son
allow
me
to
present
my
son
leon
he
only
returned
from
europe
yesterday
she
added
they
bowed
to
each
other
with
chill
courtesy
these
two
and
that
was
all
he
was
too
annoyed
at
her
coming
to
be
ordinarily
civil
and
she
was
too
frightened
at
her
grave
host
to
put
out
her
little
mite
of
a
hand
to
him
you
have
quite
surprised
me
beatrix
i
suppose
i
must
call
you
beatrix
said
mrs
le
roy
trying
to
infuse
some
warmth
into
her
frigid
manner
you
see
your
mamma
letter
miscarried
and
i
have
but
just
received
it
so
you
must
excuse
my
not
sending
the
carriage
to
meet
you
certainly
beatrix
murmured
coloring
warmly
for
a
moment
and
veiling
her
splendid
eyes
beneath
their
long
fringed
lashes
while
a
sigh
of
relief
escaped
her
lips
as
her
hostess
continued
i
dare
say
you
would
like
to
be
shown
your
room
now
that
you
may
remove
the
dust
of
travel
it
is
very
unpleasant
taking
a
journey
this
warm
weather
beatrix
agreed
with
her
and
when
she
had
herself
conducted
her
and
the
maid
clarice
to
a
lovely
suite
of
rooms
all
silver
and
azure
mrs
le
roy
returned
to
her
son
he
still
stood
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
pulling
his
dark
mustache
rather
sulkily
with
his
slender
brown
fingers
was
there
ever
such
a
she
exclaimed
going
up
to
him
what
shall
we
do
st
leon
nothing
he
answered
rather
shortly
nothing
she
echoed
helplessly
yet
with
an
accent
of
relief
in
her
voice
why
what
is
there
to
do
he
inquired
impatiently
she
is
here
whether
we
want
her
or
not
we
are
not
barbarians
we
can
not
send
our
guest
away
besides
i
have
changed
my
mind
gordon
was
right
right
she
echoed
gazing
up
into
his
face
inquiringly
my
has
our
guest
quite
upset
your
equanimity
he
inquired
smiling
down
at
her
perturbed
face
you
echo
my
words
with
pertinacity
if
i
am
disturbed
leon
it
is
on
your
account
she
replied
with
dignity
i
could
endure
the
girl
visit
very
well
myself
so
can
i
i
think
he
returned
musingly
she
is
not
at
all
what
my
fancy
painted
her
a
fashionable
beauty
who
would
rather
compel
me
to
dance
attendance
upon
her
i
could
see
that
the
little
thing
was
rather
afraid
of
me
i
dare
say
she
will
keep
out
of
my
way
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
she
was
positively
shy
and
awkward
not
at
all
like
her
mother
whom
i
remember
as
a
brilliant
belle
who
held
her
own
with
queenly
dignity
said
mrs
le
roy
i
can
not
blame
isabel
for
her
caution
beatrix
looks
too
young
to
have
a
lover
young
to
marry
yet
certainly
assented
her
son
we
will
keep
the
safe
mamma
and
woe
be
to
the
wolf
that
comes
prowling
around
the
precious
fold
he
spoke
so
dryly
that
she
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
in
jest
or
earnest
and
his
expression
was
just
as
inscrutable
as
his
tone
while
she
was
puzzling
over
both
beatrix
returned
her
plain
gray
had
been
exchanged
for
a
pretty
soft
white
robe
with
delicate
laces
about
it
and
she
carried
a
wide
sun
hat
in
her
small
dimpled
hands
the
big
dark
eyes
did
not
look
quite
so
frightened
now
they
looked
yearningly
out
at
the
beautiful
grounds
may
i
go
out
there
she
asked
i
have
never
seen
such
a
beautiful
spot
in
my
life
before
chapter
leon
looked
at
the
girl
as
she
made
her
timid
request
her
eyes
drooped
from
his
quickly
and
the
frightened
look
came
into
them
again
he
was
unaccountably
vexed
although
a
moment
before
he
had
been
pleased
because
she
was
afraid
of
him
why
should
the
little
goose
fear
me
i
am
not
an
ogre
he
said
to
himself
shortly
turning
back
to
the
window
while
mrs
le
roy
answered
politely
certainly
child
and
i
will
go
with
you
to
show
you
the
way
they
went
out
together
and
leon
watched
them
from
the
window
appearing
and
disappearing
among
the
winding
walks
the
girl
white
figure
bending
here
and
there
among
the
gay
of
flowers
the
morning
sunshine
lighting
her
waving
tresses
into
splendor
mrs
le
roy
had
given
her
as
to
the
flowers
and
she
was
eagerly
filling
her
hands
with
the
scented
beauties
after
a
little
he
remembered
that
his
mother
was
growing
old
and
that
she
must
be
weary
of
keeping
pace
with
those
light
quick
footsteps
he
hesitated
and
then
went
out
to
them
you
must
be
tired
he
said
sit
down
here
on
this
and
rest
and
i
will
take
your
place
with
miss
gordon
beatrix
turned
with
quick
compunction
are
you
tired
she
said
looking
at
mrs
le
roy
with
the
long
curling
lashes
lifted
from
her
expressive
eyes
i
am
so
sorry
i
forgot
that
it
is
new
to
you
as
it
is
to
me
shall
we
go
in
by
no
means
answered
the
lady
i
will
sit
here
and
rest
and
leon
shall
be
your
escort
she
flashed
him
a
little
glance
quickly
withdrawn
perhaps
you
would
like
she
said
he
laughed
and
walked
on
by
her
side
by
way
of
answer
thinking
to
himself
that
she
was
rather
prettier
than
he
had
thought
at
first
the
wide
was
tilted
carelessly
back
from
the
fair
low
brow
with
its
childish
fringe
of
sunny
locks
and
the
dark
eyes
with
their
long
curling
lashes
looked
darker
still
by
contrast
a
soft
color
had
come
into
her
face
and
shy
smiles
of
pleasure
hovered
around
her
lips
she
looked
like
a
child
with
the
front
of
her
white
overskirt
held
up
in
her
hands
and
filled
with
flowers
do
you
like
flowers
he
asked
her
i
them
she
answered
with
a
distinct
emphasis
on
the
words
i
love
them
and
i
never
saw
so
many
and
such
lovely
flowers
as
you
have
here
then
you
ought
to
enjoy
your
visit
to
eden
he
said
pleased
at
her
pleasure
in
his
home
and
little
thinking
how
she
enjoy
that
visit
how
all
the
joy
and
sorrow
of
her
life
would
date
from
these
summer
hours
yes
i
should
enjoy
it
i
only
only
she
said
and
paused
in
confusion
only
what
tell
me
said
leon
le
roy
thinking
suddenly
of
the
lover
from
whom
the
girl
had
been
torn
by
her
scheming
parents
she
is
thinking
of
that
fortune
hunter
that
wretched
entanglement
he
said
to
himself
wondering
what
her
next
words
would
be
only
she
went
on
with
childish
frankness
and
giving
him
one
of
her
swift
dark
glances
quickly
withdrawn
i
am
afraid
you
are
are
that
i
have
come
here
oh
wondrous
perceptions
of
innocence
he
flushed
a
little
under
his
handsome
brown
skin
and
pulled
nervously
at
his
silky
mustache
why
should
you
think
so
he
queried
i
do
know
i
i
seemed
to
feel
it
in
the
air
she
said
vaguely
and
in
a
little
troubled
tone
you
vexed
about
it
you
and
she
turned
on
him
fully
for
the
first
time
the
full
gaze
of
those
large
wondrous
black
eyes
before
whose
searching
gaze
even
the
most
accomplished
ananias
might
have
hesitated
to
answer
falsely
i
should
be
discourteous
if
i
answered
in
the
affirmative
he
said
you
need
mind
that
not
the
least
bit
in
the
world
she
said
eagerly
you
see
i
did
know
when
i
came
that
were
here
i
thought
there
was
only
an
old
lady
your
mamma
if
you
do
want
me
here
i
must
go
back
to
i
can
go
away
she
said
growing
strangely
pale
as
the
words
left
her
lips
perhaps
you
would
have
been
better
pleased
if
i
had
not
been
here
he
said
curiously
as
they
walked
on
down
a
wide
graveled
path
leading
to
the
river
perhaps
so
i
do
like
men
very
much
she
answered
with
innocent
frankness
ridiculous
affectation
when
she
is
dead
in
love
with
a
scoundrel
thought
he
gnawing
his
mustache
vexedly
somehow
since
beatrix
gordon
had
come
to
eden
he
chose
to
take
the
most
contemptible
view
of
her
lover
perhaps
you
would
like
me
to
go
away
he
said
with
fine
sarcasm
they
had
come
to
the
pretty
rustic
fence
that
bordered
the
lawn
below
it
was
the
public
road
beyond
this
the
wide
beautiful
river
with
the
white
sails
coming
and
going
on
its
glassy
breast
beatrix
sunk
down
on
a
convenient
seat
with
a
crimson
dismayed
face
some
of
the
flowers
fell
from
her
overskirt
in
the
surprise
with
which
she
regarded
him
oh
what
have
i
said
i
did
mean
never
she
cried
as
he
stooped
to
restore
her
treasures
i
would
have
you
go
away
from
your
beautiful
home
for
me
mr
le
roy
very
well
i
will
stay
i
dare
say
eden
is
wide
enough
for
us
to
keep
out
of
each
other
way
he
answered
as
he
sat
down
by
her
side
yes
surely
she
cried
and
if
if
you
will
only
tell
me
how
i
wo
bother
you
i
wo
come
in
your
way
at
all
very
well
grimly
we
will
both
stay
at
eden
and
compromise
that
way
we
will
try
not
to
intrude
upon
each
other
my
favorite
haunt
is
the
library
if
you
will
keep
out
of
there
you
may
have
the
right
of
way
in
the
rest
of
the
house
without
materially
disturbing
me
palpable
dismay
lowered
over
the
lifted
face
that
looked
so
lovely
in
the
golden
sunlight
the
library
and
the
books
are
all
there
are
they
she
asked
with
a
note
of
keen
yearning
in
her
voice
yes
do
you
like
books
he
asked
curiously
i
love
them
she
answered
discarding
the
word
like
as
she
had
done
about
the
flowers
there
was
no
half
way
strain
in
her
nature
fervent
ardent
impetuous
the
word
was
too
cold
for
her
those
things
that
pleased
her
she
then
perhaps
i
will
lend
you
some
books
sometimes
if
you
will
only
keep
out
of
my
sanctum
he
said
coolly
do
you
promise
yes
i
promise
she
replied
with
a
gentle
smothered
sigh
then
suddenly
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
asked
him
the
last
question
he
would
have
expected
to
hear
from
a
girl
nurtured
in
the
lap
of
wealth
and
luxury
mr
le
roy
if
you
were
a
girl
like
i
am
and
if
you
had
any
parents
nor
home
nor
friends
nor
any
money
nor
any
practical
education
what
would
you
do
to
earn
an
honest
living
there
was
a
palpable
anxiety
in
voice
and
face
she
had
grown
very
pale
her
dark
eyes
were
distinctly
wistful
she
is
thinking
of
that
obnoxious
lover
she
would
even
dare
poverty
for
his
sake
he
said
to
himself
in
displeasure
aloud
he
answered
carelessly
it
is
hard
to
say
what
i
should
do
in
such
a
case
miss
gordon
i
believe
i
should
throw
myself
into
that
beautiful
river
yonder
and
so
end
all
in
the
dark
he
remembered
those
words
chapter
vi
beatrix
gordon
looked
at
the
beautiful
river
with
wide
dark
eyes
the
summer
sunshine
gilded
the
blue
waves
the
white
sails
dotted
its
wide
expanse
like
fairy
shallops
gliding
to
and
fro
it
was
grand
and
dazzlingly
beautiful
but
the
young
girl
shivered
as
she
thought
of
the
dark
depths
below
she
turned
from
it
to
look
gravely
into
leon
le
roy
handsome
face
with
its
cold
cynical
eyes
you
would
throw
yourself
into
the
river
and
so
end
all
she
repeated
oh
mr
le
roy
is
it
so
hard
for
a
poor
girl
to
live
that
suicide
is
the
least
choice
of
evils
her
little
hands
clasped
each
other
tightly
over
the
mass
of
glowing
flowers
in
her
lap
and
her
red
lips
trembled
with
earnestness
he
looked
at
her
in
something
like
wonder
i
do
not
see
why
gordon
daughter
should
trouble
herself
over
such
a
question
he
said
but
since
you
ask
me
i
must
answer
yes
the
world
is
full
of
pitfalls
for
the
young
and
beautiful
girl
who
has
her
own
living
to
gain
were
i
in
the
situation
you
describe
i
believe
i
should
speedily
end
the
struggle
with
fate
by
a
leap
into
the
river
these
hastily
spoken
words
too
he
was
fated
to
recall
in
an
hour
of
which
he
dreamed
not
now
beatrix
did
not
answer
him
she
sat
very
still
looking
before
her
with
a
strange
expression
on
her
face
a
long
deep
unconscious
sigh
quivered
over
her
lips
you
are
troubled
over
what
i
said
why
he
asked
curiously
and
the
girl
answered
with
a
shiver
i
am
afraid
of
life
leon
began
to
feel
vaguely
interested
in
this
girl
whose
coming
he
had
dreaded
so
much
she
was
not
like
other
young
ladies
he
had
known
not
what
he
had
expected
the
rich
gordon
daughter
to
be
there
was
a
spice
of
originality
about
her
why
should
she
the
petted
child
of
wealth
and
luxury
think
about
these
things
of
which
she
had
talked
was
it
because
her
lover
was
poor
he
did
not
like
to
think
of
that
lover
from
whom
her
parents
wished
to
separate
her
she
was
a
child
he
said
to
himself
too
young
to
burn
her
heart
in
the
flame
of
love
i
do
not
see
why
you
should
fear
life
it
is
likely
to
prove
very
fair
and
bright
to
you
if
you
do
your
duty
if
you
implicitly
the
wishes
of
your
parents
he
said
watching
her
keenly
the
lovely
face
flushed
crimson
but
she
made
him
no
answer
she
played
with
her
flowers
nervously
she
was
afraid
of
leon
le
roy
keen
merciless
eyes
you
do
not
wish
me
to
lecture
you
upon
your
duty
he
said
after
waiting
in
vain
for
her
to
reply
no
i
do
not
think
i
do
she
replied
frankly
then
i
beg
your
pardon
indeed
i
am
not
worthy
of
lecturing
any
one
upon
that
cold
hard
word
duty
he
said
to
himself
rather
than
her
i
have
not
been
a
very
dutiful
son
myself
a
shadow
crossing
his
dark
features
beatrix
again
had
no
answer
ready
she
went
on
quietly
grouping
her
flowers
into
a
large
bunch
he
watched
the
white
hands
with
a
lazy
æsthetic
pleasure
in
their
beauty
as
they
gleamed
among
the
crimson
flowers
of
which
she
had
gathered
a
larger
quantity
than
of
any
other
color
he
began
to
talk
to
her
of
the
city
where
she
lived
of
the
places
she
had
visited
of
people
whom
he
supposed
the
gordons
would
know
he
was
amazed
at
her
ignorance
on
subjects
where
he
would
have
supposed
her
to
be
at
home
i
have
been
to
very
few
places
and
i
know
very
few
people
she
said
blushing
i
i
have
been
introduced
into
society
yet
i
am
too
young
then
where
did
she
pick
up
that
lover
he
asked
himself
she
must
have
become
infatuated
with
her
or
her
but
that
evening
when
mrs
le
roy
opened
the
piano
and
asked
her
to
play
beatrix
begged
to
be
excused
being
pressed
she
declared
that
she
had
never
learned
the
piano
she
did
not
care
for
music
at
least
not
very
much
no
one
expressed
the
surprise
they
felt
leon
played
an
aria
for
his
mother
then
they
closed
the
piano
so
it
was
not
her
who
won
her
heart
the
circle
narrows
down
to
the
professor
of
the
terpsichorean
art
he
said
to
himself
my
dear
i
have
been
watching
you
closely
said
mrs
le
roy
suddenly
you
do
not
at
all
resemble
your
mother
she
had
blue
eyes
yours
are
black
her
features
were
quite
different
from
yours
i
have
seen
your
father
but
i
forget
how
he
looked
i
suppose
you
are
like
him
yes
i
am
like
my
father
beatrix
answered
but
her
face
crimsoned
and
she
looked
as
if
she
were
about
to
burst
into
tears
she
commanded
herself
with
an
effort
and
a
little
later
declaring
that
her
head
ached
she
begged
to
be
excused
and
left
the
room
poor
girl
she
is
very
unhappy
said
mrs
le
roy
isabel
gordon
was
very
careless
to
let
that
child
have
a
lover
she
has
no
business
out
of
the
chapter
vii
beatrix
went
swiftly
to
the
pretty
where
the
maid
was
busy
sewing
on
a
of
pink
nuns
veiling
for
her
beautiful
young
mistress
she
sunk
down
upon
a
chair
and
looked
at
clarice
with
somber
miserable
eyes
oh
clarice
i
shall
have
to
give
it
all
up
she
panted
they
suspect
me
i
am
quite
sure
they
do
clarice
looked
frightened
and
disturbed
and
even
reproachful
oh
miss
gordon
do
say
that
she
exclaimed
after
all
the
drilling
you
had
a
clever
pretty
girl
like
you
ought
to
be
able
to
act
your
part
but
it
just
as
i
told
you
you
too
timid
and
nervous
because
i
am
conscious
of
my
guilt
answered
the
girl
sadly
i
should
not
be
timid
and
nervous
in
my
own
proper
character
clarice
but
you
know
makes
cowards
of
us
all
besides
i
am
ignorant
on
many
subjects
which
beatrix
gordon
ought
to
know
well
the
people
and
places
they
ask
me
about
i
know
nothing
of
and
they
look
surprised
mrs
le
roy
asked
me
to
play
on
the
piano
when
i
said
i
did
not
know
how
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
their
faces
that
was
rather
bad
the
most
of
young
ladies
know
how
to
play
on
the
piano
said
clarice
but
anyhow
they
could
make
out
a
case
against
you
for
that
you
might
have
said
that
you
did
care
for
music
so
i
did
but
the
lie
almost
blistered
my
lips
said
the
girl
for
i
love
music
dearly
and
when
mr
le
roy
played
a
beautiful
aria
i
was
afraid
he
would
see
my
delight
on
my
face
you
must
be
careful
over
that
stick
to
your
text
warned
the
maid
if
you
make
them
think
you
do
like
music
they
will
not
think
it
strange
you
can
not
play
was
there
anything
else
unpleasant
yes
mrs
le
roy
told
me
i
did
not
at
all
resemble
my
mother
oh
i
was
so
frightened
when
she
began
my
heart
sprung
to
my
lips
what
did
you
say
asked
clarice
attentively
i
told
them
i
resembled
my
father
that
was
true
at
least
answered
beatrix
sighing
well
the
game
is
not
lost
yet
said
clarice
courage
miss
gordon
hold
your
own
bravely
as
you
can
remember
all
that
is
lost
if
you
fail
i
try
to
remember
it
sighed
the
girl
if
it
were
not
for
clarice
i
should
break
down
i
know
i
should
it
is
terrible
to
be
living
a
lie
oh
clarice
do
you
think
she
is
very
happy
now
happy
as
a
queen
said
clarice
enthusiastically
and
she
was
so
good
and
sweet
she
deserved
it
oh
you
must
regret
that
you
made
a
little
sacrifice
for
her
and
is
it
a
sacrifice
after
all
look
at
this
grand
beautiful
home
all
this
luxury
around
you
where
would
you
be
if
my
mistress
had
sent
you
here
where
indeed
the
false
beatrix
gordon
shivered
as
if
with
ague
her
face
blanched
to
a
pallid
hue
she
thought
of
the
homeless
outcasts
in
the
horrible
streets
of
the
dark
flowing
river
of
leon
le
careless
words
to
her
that
day
i
would
throw
myself
into
the
river
and
so
end
all
i
should
not
do
that
unless
i
were
driven
to
desperation
said
the
girl
to
herself
with
unconscious
bravery
she
looked
through
the
window
out
upon
the
beautiful
grounds
it
is
a
lovely
home
she
said
i
could
be
very
happy
here
if
i
had
no
shadow
on
my
heart
but
i
can
not
forget
my
sin
i
remember
always
some
lines
that
i
have
read
flowers
of
eden
we
still
inherit
but
the
trail
of
the
serpent
is
over
them
all
i
would
not
call
it
a
sin
if
i
were
you
said
clarice
that
is
too
harsh
a
name
my
mistress
did
not
call
it
so
she
said
it
was
only
a
justifiable
counter
plot
only
a
harmless
girl
conspiracy
she
ought
to
know
best
she
is
older
and
wiser
than
i
am
said
the
girl
with
a
gleam
of
hope
on
her
face
clarice
was
very
clever
for
a
girl
in
her
situation
as
she
worked
away
steadily
on
the
pink
dress
she
artfully
followed
up
the
impression
her
last
words
had
made
for
my
part
i
think
it
is
the
best
joke
i
ever
heard
of
i
do
not
pity
the
gordons
one
bit
they
deserve
to
be
fooled
she
said
there
was
no
fault
in
miss
gordon
lover
only
he
was
not
as
rich
as
she
was
poverty
is
almost
a
crime
in
the
eyes
of
the
rich
is
it
not
asked
her
mistress
thoughtfully
yes
clarice
answered
almost
tartly
and
she
began
to
hum
under
her
breath
and
dimes
dollars
and
dimes
an
empty
pocket
is
the
worst
of
crimes
her
young
mistress
remained
gazing
thoughtfully
from
the
window
the
sad
expression
of
her
face
hidden
by
the
falling
waves
of
her
golden
hair
deep
heavy
sighs
breathed
at
intervals
over
her
lips
several
days
passed
quietly
without
anything
occurring
to
frighten
our
masquerading
heroine
again
the
le
roys
gave
no
sign
of
their
surprise
at
anything
that
occurred
they
had
in
fact
concluded
that
a
great
deal
of
her
oddness
and
originality
arose
from
the
fact
of
the
lover
in
the
case
when
she
looked
sad
as
she
often
did
they
concluded
she
was
thinking
of
him
when
leon
actually
came
upon
her
weeping
silently
one
day
he
thought
it
was
on
account
of
the
separation
from
our
hero
it
vexed
him
he
did
not
go
away
and
leave
her
alone
as
his
mother
would
have
done
he
said
to
her
sarcastically
are
you
crying
for
your
mamma
little
girl
beatrix
flashed
him
a
swift
angry
look
through
her
tears
and
answered
no
at
least
she
has
the
grace
to
be
honest
he
said
to
himself
some
curiosity
came
over
him
regarding
the
man
who
had
won
the
heart
of
this
girl
he
would
have
liked
to
know
his
name
and
what
he
looked
like
and
if
he
was
worthy
of
the
prize
he
had
won
confide
in
me
miss
gordon
he
said
obeying
an
impulse
he
could
not
himself
understand
tell
me
what
your
trouble
is
perhaps
i
can
help
you
beatrix
shuddered
in
horror
ah
if
he
knew
how
little
he
would
be
inclined
to
help
her
rather
he
would
spurn
her
from
the
proud
gates
of
eden
you
are
very
kind
she
faltered
i
thank
you
but
it
is
nothing
he
looked
at
her
a
little
scornfully
i
have
heard
that
women
cry
for
nothing
he
said
i
suppose
it
must
be
true
as
i
now
hear
it
confirmed
by
one
of
the
sex
she
seldom
saw
him
except
at
meals
and
a
little
while
in
the
of
an
evening
the
most
of
his
time
was
spent
in
the
library
or
out
riding
and
walking
but
one
day
he
came
to
her
abruptly
i
am
going
up
to
new
york
for
a
few
days
he
said
i
hope
you
will
make
use
of
my
library
while
i
am
out
of
the
way
thank
you
she
said
radiantly
if
i
should
see
your
parents
he
continued
shall
i
give
them
any
message
for
you
she
started
and
the
crimson
rose
she
was
holding
fell
from
her
hands
he
wondered
why
she
grew
so
deadly
pale
and
trembled
so
the
sudden
radiance
of
a
moment
ago
had
all
gone
from
her
face
give
them
my
love
she
said
in
a
husky
voice
and
tell
them
tell
them
that
i
am
greatly
enjoying
my
visit
to
eden
chapter
viii
leon
came
home
one
afternoon
and
made
his
way
straight
to
the
library
the
thickly
carpeted
floor
gave
back
no
echo
to
his
footfalls
and
he
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
room
several
minutes
gazing
in
at
the
open
door
unobserved
by
the
single
occupant
of
the
apartment
as
he
had
shrewdly
suspected
his
mother
guest
had
availed
herself
to
the
full
of
his
permission
to
use
the
library
in
his
absence
quite
oblivious
of
his
near
presence
now
beatrix
was
curled
up
in
his
great
in
a
cozy
kittenish
attitude
her
warm
flushed
cheek
buried
in
the
hollow
of
one
small
hand
her
dark
eyes
bent
in
rapt
interest
on
an
open
book
in
her
lap
a
ray
of
sunshine
stealing
through
the
lace
curtains
at
the
window
penciled
golden
bars
on
her
white
dress
and
bright
hair
making
her
look
like
a
picture
to
whose
beauty
leon
cultured
eyes
were
by
no
means
oblivious
he
hesitated
to
startle
her
from
her
pretty
negligent
attitude
but
as
he
gazed
his
mesmeric
eyes
irresistibly
attracted
hers
she
glanced
up
and
met
his
dark
burning
eyes
fixed
with
a
strange
inscrutable
expression
upon
her
own
instantly
beatrix
sprung
up
the
book
falling
to
the
floor
a
little
cry
of
surprise
on
her
lips
her
face
paling
a
look
of
inexplicable
terror
in
her
dark
eyes
am
i
an
ogre
that
you
do
me
the
honor
to
be
frightened
at
me
miss
gordon
he
inquired
advancing
into
the
room
a
tone
of
displeasure
in
his
deep
musical
voice
i
i
was
not
frightened
only
startled
sir
said
beatrix
faintly
as
she
stooped
to
recover
her
book
she
laid
it
upon
the
table
and
was
about
to
leave
the
room
when
he
stopped
her
with
a
slight
wave
of
his
gloved
hand
resume
your
seat
miss
gordon
i
shall
not
believe
you
are
not
frightened
if
you
run
away
like
this
he
said
she
sat
down
with
a
gasp
and
waited
she
had
been
full
of
vague
fears
and
suspicions
regarding
his
visit
to
new
york
she
waited
with
a
beating
heart
and
a
pale
face
for
his
next
words
he
would
say
with
that
fine
scorn
his
mobile
face
was
so
capable
of
expressing
you
are
found
out
in
your
miserable
conspiracy
laurel
vane
you
have
come
here
pretending
to
be
gordon
daughter
while
you
covered
her
elopement
with
her
lover
the
true
beatrix
gordon
is
far
away
married
to
the
man
she
has
chosen
in
defiance
of
her
parents
and
friends
punishment
can
not
reach
her
but
you
laurel
vane
will
have
to
suffer
for
the
outrage
you
have
helped
to
perpetrate
on
the
gordons
and
on
us
while
she
waited
with
a
sick
horror
to
hear
him
utter
those
words
she
wondered
vaguely
what
they
would
do
to
her
for
her
share
in
beatrix
gordon
conspiracy
could
they
cast
her
into
prison
she
had
seen
the
outside
of
a
penitentiary
once
how
grim
and
dark
and
forbidding
it
looked
with
its
iron
doors
and
grated
windows
would
they
shut
her
up
in
all
her
youth
and
beauty
in
such
a
horrible
place
as
that
and
for
how
long
she
shuddered
as
she
thought
that
it
might
be
for
life
she
had
no
idea
in
her
youth
and
innocence
how
far
and
how
long
the
powerful
arm
of
the
law
could
reach
but
the
dreadful
words
for
which
she
waited
while
a
hand
of
ice
seemed
to
grip
her
throat
remained
unspoken
mr
le
roy
seated
himself
leisurely
and
drew
off
his
dark
kid
gloves
then
he
took
up
the
volume
she
had
been
reading
and
glanced
at
the
title
i
hope
you
have
enjoyed
your
monopoly
of
my
library
he
said
yes
she
answered
faintly
and
you
are
sorry
i
have
returned
to
oust
you
from
its
enjoyments
are
you
he
asked
studying
her
young
face
keenly
i
should
be
very
rude
to
say
so
she
answered
gaining
courage
as
the
dreadful
charge
for
which
she
waited
was
delayed
as
to
that
you
can
not
be
ruder
than
i
was
in
desiring
you
to
stay
out
of
this
room
while
i
was
at
home
he
replied
with
an
air
of
insincerity
will
you
pardon
my
selfishness
miss
gordon
and
permit
me
to
remove
the
embargo
she
could
scarcely
believe
her
ears
his
tone
was
distinctly
kind
had
he
then
found
out
nothing
was
her
secret
safe
yet
a
little
longer
seeing
that
she
hesitated
and
did
not
speak
he
continued
i
give
you
as
to
the
use
of
this
room
whether
i
am
absent
or
present
will
you
come
here
whenever
you
choose
to
read
or
write
or
study
you
will
not
disturb
me
neither
shall
i
disturb
you
thank
you
she
murmured
not
yet
daring
to
look
at
him
you
thank
me
but
you
do
not
say
you
will
come
he
said
will
you
please
to
look
at
me
a
moment
miss
gordon
i
like
to
be
looked
at
when
i
am
talking
with
an
effort
she
lifted
her
long
fringed
lashes
and
forced
herself
to
meet
his
proud
glittering
dark
eyes
i
am
a
spoiled
child
i
like
to
be
humored
he
said
with
a
smile
that
lighted
his
face
into
a
subtle
sweetness
that
first
showed
her
how
dangerously
fascinating
the
master
of
eden
could
be
when
he
willed
i
want
you
to
tell
me
miss
gordon
that
you
forgive
my
selfishness
the
other
day
and
that
you
will
come
to
this
room
as
freely
as
to
any
other
room
in
the
house
you
will
promise
me
will
you
not
no
one
ever
refuses
anything
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
you
had
a
right
she
said
incoherently
if
there
was
and
mind
i
do
not
admit
there
was
i
forgive
you
freely
thank
you
and
you
will
come
sometimes
perhaps
she
stammered
he
pulled
at
his
dark
mustache
impatiently
i
must
have
a
more
definite
promise
than
that
he
said
i
am
used
to
having
my
way
about
everything
though
the
words
were
arrogant
the
tone
was
kind
he
was
thoroughly
in
earnest
she
hesitated
she
did
not
want
to
be
drawn
into
such
a
promise
standing
too
much
in
awe
of
the
stately
master
of
eden
you
will
not
promise
he
said
piqued
very
well
but
you
are
the
first
woman
who
ever
refused
a
request
of
leon
le
roy
your
forgiveness
was
only
half
hearted
he
was
more
vexed
than
she
knew
his
wonderful
condescension
had
not
borne
the
fruit
he
expected
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
pulled
at
his
dark
mustache
with
his
shapely
fingers
the
costly
diamond
on
his
hand
flashing
luridly
what
a
stubborn
little
mite
it
is
to
refuse
to
humor
me
he
thought
to
himself
in
displeasure
while
the
small
object
of
his
displeasure
watched
the
door
with
longing
eyes
yearning
to
escape
from
the
oppressive
dignity
of
his
presence
she
felt
herself
growing
crimson
under
his
cold
proud
gaze
you
have
not
asked
me
yet
if
i
saw
your
parents
he
said
after
some
minutes
of
that
oppressive
silence
it
is
coming
now
thought
the
small
culprit
in
despair
and
she
felt
guiltily
that
the
color
was
all
fading
out
of
her
cheeks
under
those
watchful
eyes
she
could
only
stammer
faintly
did
you
to
her
infinite
joy
and
relief
he
answered
in
the
negative
no
i
did
not
see
them
i
called
twice
but
at
both
times
they
were
out
once
driving
in
the
park
and
again
attending
a
reception
you
do
not
look
sorry
miss
gordon
although
it
was
purely
out
of
courtesy
to
you
that
i
went
there
indeed
i
am
very
sorry
she
murmured
but
she
could
not
make
her
face
look
so
his
words
were
so
great
a
relief
to
her
that
she
could
not
look
disappointed
he
did
not
tell
her
how
disappointed
he
was
he
would
not
have
owned
to
himself
that
he
had
hoped
to
hear
something
about
that
lover
from
whom
they
had
separated
her
he
would
even
have
liked
to
have
seen
him
it
was
a
new
thing
for
the
leon
le
roy
to
feel
curious
over
anything
but
he
had
a
great
deal
of
curiosity
over
the
man
whom
beatrix
gordon
loved
i
should
like
to
know
if
he
is
worthy
of
her
was
his
excuse
to
his
own
heart
but
he
had
not
seen
the
gordons
and
he
had
found
out
nothing
about
their
daughter
lover
if
he
is
good
and
true
and
noble
i
should
like
to
help
the
child
to
happiness
he
said
to
himself
if
he
is
an
ignoble
as
they
say
i
should
most
decidedly
try
to
forward
the
gordons
plot
and
it
was
rather
curious
that
in
his
own
mind
he
had
quite
decided
that
the
unknown
young
man
was
a
villain
of
the
deepest
dye
he
pitied
beatrix
for
having
fallen
in
love
with
a
scamp
who
was
only
after
her
money
but
as
the
days
went
by
a
change
came
over
beatrix
that
puzzled
him
some
of
her
shyness
her
timidity
her
sadness
wore
off
a
look
of
contentment
dawned
on
the
fair
face
and
in
the
dark
eyes
her
cheeks
gained
color
and
roundness
she
even
laughed
sometimes
a
mellow
laugh
that
was
so
sweet
and
glad
it
thrilled
one
heart
to
hear
it
mrs
le
roy
was
puzzled
she
is
certainly
not
pining
for
her
lover
she
said
to
her
son
at
first
she
was
so
strange
and
sad
i
thought
she
was
breaking
her
heart
over
him
but
she
is
so
young
it
is
likely
that
change
of
scene
has
driven
him
completely
out
of
her
mind
the
gordons
did
well
to
send
her
here
the
day
came
when
she
changed
her
mind
on
that
latter
point
in
her
heart
mrs
le
roy
had
a
secret
fancy
that
the
charms
of
her
son
had
quite
blotted
out
the
image
of
beatrix
absent
lover
from
her
young
heart
not
that
leon
or
beatrix
gave
her
any
reason
to
think
so
but
the
wish
was
father
to
the
thought
she
would
have
been
delighted
if
these
two
had
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
for
the
greatest
desire
of
her
heart
was
to
see
leon
married
chapter
ix
in
the
private
parlor
of
a
neat
hotel
in
a
city
not
very
far
from
new
york
the
true
beatrix
gordon
was
sitting
one
lovely
morning
awaiting
the
coming
of
her
husband
although
beatrix
had
deceived
and
deserted
her
parents
and
foisted
an
impostor
on
the
aristocratic
le
roys
she
looked
positively
and
undeniably
happy
this
bright
summer
morning
her
lovely
blonde
face
with
its
crown
of
soft
golden
hair
glowed
with
love
and
happiness
and
her
beauty
was
enhanced
by
her
becoming
of
soft
pale
blue
with
delicate
trimmings
of
rich
cream
tinted
lace
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
cyril
wentworth
her
handsome
young
husband
entered
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
he
kissed
his
fair
young
bride
and
held
the
delicate
envelope
tantalizingly
out
of
reach
at
last
cried
young
wentworth
eagerly
and
she
sprung
upon
a
chair
and
gayly
possessed
herself
of
her
letter
it
is
from
my
sweet
little
laurel
she
tore
it
open
and
ran
her
eyes
quickly
over
the
contents
while
her
husband
watched
her
expressive
face
with
deep
anxiety
she
finished
at
last
and
turned
her
fond
smiling
blue
eyes
upon
cyril
questioning
face
all
goes
well
she
said
they
have
not
discovered
my
charming
little
plot
yet
papa
and
mamma
have
written
and
they
are
both
as
well
as
usual
clarice
answered
their
letters
and
imitated
my
hand
and
style
so
well
that
they
were
completely
imposed
upon
clarice
must
be
a
clever
maid
said
cyril
she
is
said
beatrix
her
education
is
far
above
that
of
her
class
generally
she
was
very
valuable
to
me
i
hated
to
part
with
her
but
i
was
obliged
to
send
her
to
eden
to
keep
up
appearances
answer
mamma
letters
and
keep
laurel
vane
up
to
her
part
and
when
is
this
farce
to
end
asked
cyril
oh
not
for
several
months
yet
if
i
can
help
it
answered
the
pretty
bride
looking
frightened
at
the
very
idea
but
why
keep
it
up
so
long
i
can
not
understand
your
reluctance
to
have
your
parents
learn
the
truth
love
they
can
not
forbid
the
bans
now
for
we
are
united
as
fast
as
church
and
state
can
bind
us
said
cyril
wentworth
who
had
an
honest
open
nature
and
now
that
he
had
won
his
bonny
bride
longed
to
have
the
whole
world
hear
what
a
prize
he
had
won
i
have
a
secret
reason
cyril
darling
said
the
fair
bride
twining
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
looking
up
in
his
face
with
sweet
shining
eyes
if
laurel
plays
her
part
well
and
i
can
keep
our
marriage
a
secret
a
few
months
some
great
good
fortune
will
come
to
us
cyril
if
not
if
it
is
all
found
out
sooner
why
then
with
a
little
contented
sigh
i
shall
still
have
you
my
dear
fate
can
not
take
you
from
me
i
am
dying
of
curiosity
darling
laughed
cyril
wentworth
no
matter
you
shall
not
hear
one
word
till
the
time
is
up
answered
beatrix
gayly
i
forbid
you
to
even
think
of
the
matter
again
sir
your
wishes
are
my
law
answered
the
in
a
tone
as
gay
as
hers
there
is
one
thing
that
troubles
me
she
said
presently
running
her
eyes
again
over
the
letter
which
she
still
held
open
in
her
hand
laurel
writes
me
that
mrs
le
roy
son
has
returned
from
his
european
tour
and
is
at
eden
why
should
that
trouble
you
dearest
he
inquired
tenderly
do
you
not
see
that
the
chances
of
discovery
are
doubled
cyril
mrs
le
roy
seldom
leaves
home
and
would
be
far
more
likely
to
be
imposed
upon
by
our
little
conspiracy
than
would
her
son
laurel
writes
me
that
he
is
keen
critical
brusque
she
is
afraid
of
him
i
have
a
fancy
about
this
mr
le
roy
said
cyril
lightly
he
will
fall
in
love
with
the
pretty
little
impostor
and
marry
her
beatrix
looked
grave
and
troubled
at
this
novel
suggestion
oh
would
never
do
she
cried
my
little
laurel
is
as
beautiful
as
a
dream
but
she
is
not
a
fitting
mate
for
leon
le
roy
he
is
wealthy
and
aristocratic
and
i
have
heard
as
proud
as
lucifer
and
she
a
drunken
journalist
daughter
no
no
that
would
never
do
cyril
she
would
not
dare
i
am
not
afraid
of
such
a
thing
she
shall
come
and
live
with
me
and
be
like
my
own
sister
when
her
stay
at
eden
is
over
and
we
shall
find
her
a
husband
more
suitable
to
her
than
leon
le

chapter
x
two
months
had
passed
and
laurel
vane
still
remained
at
eden
in
her
character
of
gordon
daughter
the
clever
conspiracy
had
not
been
discovered
yet
indeed
there
seemed
less
chance
of
this
catastrophe
than
at
first
laurel
with
ready
adaptability
was
beginning
to
fit
herself
into
her
place
under
clarice
constant
tuitions
and
admonitions
her
shyness
and
timidity
had
been
somewhat
overcome
and
a
pretty
graceful
ease
had
replaced
it
her
beauty
had
expanded
and
increased
like
a
flower
in
the
sunshine
as
the
first
restraint
of
her
manner
wore
off
she
developed
a
rare
grace
and
winning
sweetness
that
added
to
her
native
originality
made
her
very
charming
mrs
le
roy
in
her
stately
quiet
way
had
grown
fond
of
her
guest
although
there
could
not
be
a
greater
contrast
imagined
than
exists
between
beatrix
and
her
mother
i
am
inclined
to
give
the
palm
to
the
former
she
confided
to
leon
i
was
fond
of
gordon
when
she
was
a
girl
she
was
a
fair
sweet
young
girl
but
she
lacked
the
charms
that
distinguish
beatrix
the
girl
makes
me
think
of
some
beautiful
timid
wild
bird
at
first
you
thought
her
awkward
and
uncultivated
said
leon
carelessly
it
was
mere
shyness
that
has
worn
off
long
ago
answered
mrs
le
roy
she
puzzles
me
still
but
she
no
longer
appears
awkward
and
uncultured
still
i
admit
that
her
education
has
been
an
unconventional
one
she
knows
little
that
a
girl
in
her
position
might
be
expected
to
know
on
the
contrary
she
has
some
attainments
not
to
be
looked
for
she
knows
german
and
latin
and
some
french
but
she
has
no
accomplishments
and
she
can
not
play
the
piano
she
says
her
father
educated
her
i
take
it
he
is
a
peculiar
person
rather
i
should
say
leon
assents
with
his
slightly
bored
air
anyhow
i
believe
she
is
perfectly
cured
of
her
fancy
for
that
that
person
i
have
never
heard
his
name
yet
have
you
st
leon
yes
it
is
cyril
wentworth
a
good
name
is
it
possible
that
beatrix
told
you
exclaims
his
mother
no
i
heard
it
once
by
the
merest
accident
on
one
of
my
trips
to
new
york
leon
answers
with
bland
indifference
and
a
ah
what
kind
of
a
man
is
he
leon
as
black
as
he
was
painted
by
no
means
they
say
even
the
devil
is
not
that
you
know
with
a
short
dry
laugh
i
have
even
seen
the
fellow
he
is
comparatively
poor
i
should
say
that
that
is
the
worst
there
is
to
him
handsome
as
apollo
and
better
still
he
answers
with
a
short
dry
laugh
that
has
a
ring
of
bitterness
in
it
the
mother
heart
quick
in
instinct
catches
the
subtle
intonation
of
almost
envy
in
that
one
concluding
word
she
lays
her
white
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
looks
up
into
the
handsome
proud
face
with
its
cold
curled
lips
not
pityingly
leon
has
never
borne
pity
in
his
life
but
with
fondest
love
and
admiration
as
young
as
you
st
leon
she
asks
speciously
solving
his
unacknowledged
wound
why
mother
how
you
talk
he
says
not
unkindly
why
i
am
thirty
five
my
last
birthday
and
the
and
gray
hairs
not
so
far
away
do
you
care
my
son
she
asks
him
a
little
wistfully
care
why
should
i
he
asks
frowning
and
yet
i
have
no
mind
to
contradict
the
poet
who
says
loss
of
youth
is
sadness
to
all
who
think
or
feel
a
wound
no
after
gladness
can
ever
wholly
heal
and
yet
so
many
share
it
we
learn
at
last
to
bear
it
his
glance
wanders
from
the
window
out
into
the
beautiful
grounds
where
laurel
vane
is
wandering
lovely
in
the
golden
springtime
of
youth
sweet
face
swift
eyes
and
gleaming
mingling
hair

like
two
dreaming
in

is
not
more
calm
nor
sweeter
and
love
is
not
more
fair
after
all
there
is
nothing
on
earth
so
beautiful
as
youth
he
says
aloud
his
dark
eyes
following
the
flutter
of
that
white
robe
among
the
trees
she
looks
furtively
past
him
and
sees
laurel
too
the
sunlight
shining
on
the
fair
young
face
her
white
heaped
high
with
flowers
after
her
usual
fashion
the
refrain
of
a
song
on
her
lips
that
floats
back
to
them
in
snatches
it
is
browning
the
yes
yes
i
answered
you
last
night
no
this
morning
sir
i
say
colors
seen
by
will
not
look
the
same
by
day
when
the
viols
played
their
best
lamps
above
and
laughs
below
love
me
sounded
like
a
jest
fit
for
yes
or
fit
for
no
mrs
le
roy
laid
her
delicate
hand
all
glittering
with
jewels
on
the
shoulder
of
her
idolized
son
leon
you
talk
of
growing
old
she
said
my
son
does
not
the
flight
of
time
remind
you
that
you
are
neglecting
a
duty
you
owe
to
yourself
he
turned
to
look
curiously
into
her
face
and
the
white
figure
out
among
the
trees
wandered
further
away
seeking
new
delights
like
the
butterflies
among
the
flowers
the
echo
of
her
song
died
in
the
distance
duty
mother
he
said
carelessly
i
did
not
know
that
the
vocabulary
of
my
life
contained
that
hard
word
i
thought
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
drink
and
sarcastically
merry
leon
you
are
but
feigning
ignorance
of
my
meaning
she
said
wistfully
you
understand
me
upon
my
honor
no
he
said
explain
yourself
you
should
marry
a
flush
crept
under
his
olive
skin
his
slender
straight
black
brows
met
in
a
frown
over
the
proud
dark
eyes
i
thought
we
had
dropped
that
subject
ages
ago
he
said
frigidly
forgive
me
pleadingly
i
can
not
help
but
revive
it
again
leon
when
you
quoted
that
epicurean
motto
drink
and
be
merry
you
forgot
that
latter
clause
we
he
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
impatiently
well
he
said
we
she
repeated
and
oh
leon
there
is
no
heir
to
eden
importe
lifting
his
dark
brows
with
a
slight
gesture
of
indifference
oh
my
son
do
not
treat
it
with
indifference
she
cried
you
are
the
last
le
roy
of
your
race
the
fine
old
name
will
die
with
you
the
wealth
of
the
le
roys
will
pass
to
strangers
unless
you
marry
and
leave
an
heir
i
am
proud
i
can
not
bear
to
have
it
thus
oh
leon
choose
yourself
a
wife
and
me
a
daughter
from
among
the
fair
dames
of
your
own
land
her
handsome
haughty
old
face
was
transformed
with
emotion
her
dark
eyes
dim
with
tears
he
turned
from
the
sight
of
it
and
looked
from
the
window
again
but
the
slim
white
figure
no
longer
gleamed
among
the
green
trees
and
the
bright
of
flowers
it
had
strayed
out
of
sight
where
shall
i
find
you
a
daughter
worthy
of
your
love
my
lady
mother
he
said
lightly
yet
with
some
intangible
emotion
beneath
his
tone
she
hesitated
and
her
glance
too
wandered
from
the
window
and
came
back
disappointed
leon
what
do
you
think
of
beatrix
gordon
she
asked
wistfully
the
dark
eyes
flashed
for
shame
mother
would
i
steal
another

strayed
carelessly
on
to

gates
of

the
light
song
still
lingering
on
her
lips
the
light
of

reflected
in

eyes

on
her
face
she
was
learning
to
be
happy
this
beautiful
girl
over
whose
unconscious
head
hung
the
shadow
of
long
years
of
sorrow
she
leaned
her
arm
on
the
rustic
gate
and
looked
wonderingly
as
she
often
did
across
the
dusty
at
the
beautiful
river
should
i
ever
be
coward
enough
to
throw
myself
into
its
dark
depths
and
end
all
she
asked
herself
with
sudden
gravity
a
sudden
step
the
dark
figure
of
a
man
looming
before
her
made
her
lift
her
wide
dark
eyes
a
cry
of
mingled
horror
loathing

after
all
my
fruitless
search
but
i
might
have
known
that
such
an
angel
would
fly
to
eden
horror
unutterable
had
seized
upon
laurel
the
song
had
died
on
her
lips
the
color
fled
from
her
face
she
stared
at
her
foe
with
parted
lips
from
which
the
breath
came
in
palpitating
gasps
while
her
wide
terrified
eyes
had
the
anguished
look
of
some
hunted
creature
he
had
come
to
betray
her
she
said
to
herself
all
was
ended
now
he
had
found
her
out
he
would
tell
the
le
roys
who
she
was
and
how
she
had
deceived
them
she
could
fancy
mrs
le
roy
scathing
words
of
condemnation
she
could
imagine
the
lightning
scorn
in
proud
cold
eyes
stifling
the
moan
upon
her
lips
she
cried
out
in
passionate
despair
ross
powell
what
has
brought
you
here
i
might
ask
you
the
same
question
he
returned
coolly
it
certainly
never
entered
my
mind
that
i
should
find
the
daughter
of
louis
vane
a
visitor
at
eden
he
had
spoken
unwarily
his
words
let
in
a
sudden
light
upon
her
mind
he
had
not
traced
her
here
then
whatever
had
brought
him
to
eden
it
had
been
some
other
cause
than
the
denunciation
of
beatrix
plot
her
heart
leaped
with
hope
then
sunk
heavily
again
he
was
here
and
he
would
find
her
out
she
could
trust
to
his
hate
and
his
desire
for
vengeance
for
that
obeying
a
sudden
desperate
impulse
she
pushed
open
the
gate
and
stepped
out
into
the
road
you
are
right
she
said
bitterly
do
you
think
that
the
proud
rich
le
roys
would
have
laurel
vane
for
their
guest
my
errand
at
eden
is
done
powell
let
me
pass
if
you
please
he
stood
before
her
dumbfounded
at
her
coolness
glancing
from
her
pale
agitated
face
to
the
flowers
she
carried
in
her
apron
with
ostentatious
care
your
errand
he
stammered
the
flowers
yes
she
answered
calmly
i
must
take
them
home
will
you
please
to
stand
out
of
the
way
mr
powell
one
moment
he
said
still
hindering
her
way
where
is
your
home
where
can
i
find
you
her
eyes
flashed
scornfully
upon
him
what
can
it
matter
to
you
she
said
do
you
think
i
would
receive
you
in
my
home
you
the
cowardly
insulter
of
helpless
girlhood
never
i
hate
you
as
i
hate
the
slimy
crawling
serpent
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
out
of
my
way
he
caught
her
fiercely
by
the
arm
and
hissed
i
shall
find
you
out
be
sure
of
that
my
incarnation
of
indignant
virtue
and
when
i
do
laurel
vane
you
shall
find
that
the
serpent
you
hate
can
sting
she
tried
to
shake
off
the
brutal
grasp
of
his
fingers
but
he
held
her
in
a
grasp
of
steel
and
would
not
let
her
go
you
hurt
me
she
said
desperately
release
my
arm
ross
powell
or
i
will
scream
for
help
i
hear
coming
whoever
it
is
i
will
appeal
for
protection
the
threat
had
the
effect
he
threw
her
arm
from
him
with
a
smothered
oath
laurel
pushed
quickly
past
him
and
walked
on
down
the
road
a
carriage
rattled
past
and
under
cover
of
the
cloud
of
dust
it
raised
she
looked
furtively
back
at
her
worsted
foe
he
had
entered
the
gate
of
eden
and
was
walking
slowly
up
the
graveled
path
to
the
house
he
is
really
going
there
she
said
trembling
and
o
heaven
upon
what
mission
he
is
gordon
clerk
and
he
has
come
upon
some
errand
to
beatrix
gordon
they
will
send
out
to
search
for
me
and
he
will
learn
the
truth
i
can
not
go
back
i
am
afraid
i
must
hide
myself
until
he
is
gone
her
trembling
limbs
would
scarcely
support
her
but
she
walked
on
as
fast
as
she
could
her
mind
filled
with
vague
conjectures
and
dire
suspicions
perhaps
gordon
has
sent
for
beatrix
to
return
home
she
thought
despairingly
then
the
conspiracy
will
all
be
discovered
i
shall
be
driven
away
from
beautiful
eden
a
pang
like
a
dagger
thrust
pierced
her
heart
at
the
thought
she
looked
back
at
the
towered
and
turreted
mansion
and
the
beautiful
extensive
grounds
with
something
of
that
hopeless
despair
our
first
mother
must
have
felt
on
leaving
paradise
the
scent
of
the
flowers
she
carried
filled
her
with
keenest
pain
shall
i
ever
dare
go
back
she
said
am
i
going
away
for
the
last
time
now
with
no
home
no
friends
to
turn
to
in
my
despair
with
nothing
but
these
flowers
and
a
memory
as
she
plodded
slowly
along
she
came
to
a
little
private
gate
in
the
rustic
fence
that
inclosed
eden
it
led
into
a
picturesque
bosky
dell
with
running
streams
leafy
shades
cool
green
turf
and
beds
of
wild
flowers
and
exquisite
ferns
the
master
of
eden
carried
the
key
to
this
private
entrance
often
preferring
it
to
the
more
ostentatious
front
gate
with
its
imposing
lions
keeping
grim
watch
and
ward
laurel
paused
and
leaned
her
arms
on
the
low
fence
and
gazed
at
the
cool
light
and
shade
that
flickered
on
the
green
grass
beneath
the
waving
boughs
of
the
trees
the
hot
dusty
road
was
disagreeable
she
longed
to
go
inside
and
throw
herself
down
to
rest
no
one
from
the
house
ever
came
here
except
leon
le
roy
and
he
but
seldom
it
was
a
favorite
haunt
of
laurel
and
it
struck
her
now
that
it
would
be
an
excellent
sighing
at
its
inaccessibility
laurel
bowed
her
head
on
her
hands
and
the
first
thing
that
caught
the
sight
of
her
downcast
eyes
was
the
glitter
of
the
steel
key
on
the
inside
of
the
gate
where
mr
le
roy
had
inadvertently
left
it
that
morning
with
a
cry
of
joy
laurel
slipped
her
hand
through
the
iron
bars
of
the
gate
unlocked
it
and
entered
then
she
hastened
to
the
remotest
retreat
on
the
grounds
a
little
natural
bower
formed
by
the
thick
interlacing
boughs
of
the
trees
and
vines
that
grew
thickly
and
luxuriantly
close
by
a
clear
meandering
stream
rippling
on
with
a
pleasant
murmur
laurel
threw
herself
down
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
in
this
sylvan
retreat
and
leaning
her
head
on
her
hand
listened
pensively
to
the
song
of
the
birds
and
the
musical
murmur
of
the
little
streamlet
her
heart
beat
more
calmly
in
the
solitude
and
stillness
that
was
only
broken
by
the
sweet
sounds
of
nature
a
little
hope
flickered
feebly
to
life
in
her
breast
clarice
is
so
clever
she
will
save
me
perhaps
she
whispered
to
herself
chapter
xii
in
the
meantime
ross
powell
with
his
mind
full
of
his
rencounter
with
laurel
and
his
passions
all
aflame
with
love
and
hate
commingled
wended
his
way
to
the
stately
home
of
the
le
roys
it
was
true
as
laurel
had
conjectured
that
he
had
come
on
business
with
beatrix
gordon
but
the
sudden
exciting
meeting
with
the
dead
daughter
had
almost
driven
his
employer
business
out
of
his
mind
he
determined
to
get
through
this
interview
with
miss
gordon
as
soon
as
possible
that
he
might
gain
time
to
trace
the
scornful
laurel
to
her
home
his
disappointment
was
accordingly
great
when
he
was
informed
that
miss
gordon
had
gone
for
a
walk
on
his
polite
intimation
that
he
had
but
an
hour
to
remain
clarice
was
sent
out
to
bring
her
mistress
in
pretty
clever
clarice
having
informed
herself
as
to
the
identity
of
the
visitor
departed
on
her
errand
her
quick
brain
teeming
with
plans
to
avoid
the
threatened
exposure
and
ross
powell
waited
his
little
hour
and
saw
the
sunset
gleams
kindling
the
waves
of
the
hudson
with
gold
and
still
she
came
not
impatience
burned
to
in
his
breast
though
he
was
outwardly
calm
and
deferentially
polite
to
mrs
le
roy
and
her
stately
son
the
master
of
eden
inspired
him
with
some
little
awe
he
shrunk
from
the
keen
clear
glances
of
the
cynical
dark
eyes
they
seemed
to
pierce
through
him
and
read
his
shallow
selfish
nature
to
the
core
he
felt
his
own
littleness
by
contrast
with
the
calm
proud
bearing
of
leon
le
roy
and
resented
it
with
carefully
concealed
anger
while
he
waited
for
miss
gordon
coming
he
ventured
nonchalantly
on
one
leading
question
could
they
tell
him
if
there
was
a
young
lady
staying
in
the
neighborhood
named
laurel
vane
laurel
vane
what
a
sweet
pretty
name
said
mrs
le
roy
no
i
do
not
believe
there
is
i
have
never
heard
the
name
before
it
is
possible
that
she
may
be
occupying
some
subordinate
position
a
governess
perhaps
suggested
powell
i
do
not
know
i
have
never
heard
of
her
said
the
hostess
carelessly
then
appealing
to
her
son
have
you
st
leon
and
he
in
his
blindness
answered
no
ross
powell
did
not
know
how
to
believe
them
had
he
not
met
her
coming
out
of
their
grounds
loaded
with
their
rare
flowers
he
asked
himself
what
interest
these
rich
people
had
in
deceiving
him
about
laurel
vane
while
he
puzzled
over
the
question
a
sudden
solution
presented
itself
to
his
mind
she
must
be
figuring
under
an
assumed
name
these
rich
le
roys
could
have
had
no
interest
in
deceiving
him
about
humble
little
laurel
vane
he
did
not
know
how
nearly
his
chance
conjecture
had
hit
the
mark
but
his
suspicions
made
him
all
the
more
eager
to
get
away
and
seek
for
her
if
she
had
really
been
clever
enough
to
hide
herself
under
a
fictitious
name
she
would
be
all
the
harder
to
find
the
difficulty
only
made
him
more
zealous
in
pursuit
he
assumed
an
air
of
polite
regret
and
began
to
pave
his
way
to
departure
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
await
miss
gordon
return
any
longer
this
evening
as
i
have
a
friend
waiting
for
me
at
the
hotel
he
said
but
indeed
there
is
no
real
necessity
that
i
should
see
her
at
all
beyond
the
pleasure
her
father
would
experience
in
hearing
that
i
had
done
so
i
will
call
again
in
the
morning
and
perhaps
find
her
at
home
in
the
meantime
he
drew
two
letters
and
a
small
package
from
his
breast
i
am
the
bearer
of
a
letter
to
you
mrs
le
roy
and
one
for
miss
gordon
with
this
packet
and
her
father
love
i
shall
be
pleased
to
receive
your
answer
in
the
morning
before
i
return
to
new
york
he
presented
them
and
bowed
himself
out
so
eager
to
find
laurel
vane
that
he
gave
scarcely
a
thought
to
miss
gordon
defection
the
deepening
twilight
fell
and
still
neither
clarice
nor
her
mistress
returned
mrs
le
roy
began
to
feel
some
little
anxiety
she
never
stayed
out
like
this
before
she
said
to
leon
can
she
have
eluded
us
and
eloped
with
her
lover
i
am
afraid
i
have
allowed
her
too
much
liberty
what
do
you
think
st
leon
there
was
a
gloomy
flash
in
his
eyes
but
before
he
could
speak
clarice
came
running
in
breathless
and
eager
with
genuine
alarm
on
her
face
has
he
gone
she
gasped
an
hour
ago
said
mrs
le
roy
where
is
miss
gordon
clarice
oh
mrs
le
roy
i
can
not
find
her
anywhere
gasped
the
girl
in
a
frightened
tone
chapter
xiii
there
was
genuine
alarm
on
the
maid
pretty
intelligent
face
mrs
le
roy
was
startled
have
you
been
all
over
the
grounds
are
you
sure
you
have
looked
everywhere
she
cried
oh
i
do
not
think
i
have
missed
a
single
spot
cried
clarice
wringing
her
hands
i
have
been
all
over
eden
i
have
been
out
into
the
road
and
along
the
river
bank
i
am
afraid
she
has
thrown
herself
into
the
water
leon
looked
at
her
with
his
piercing
dark
eyes
why
should
she
do
that
he
asked
her
sharply
oh
sir
surely
you
know
she
was
very
unhappy
she
faltered
about
her
lover
asked
mrs
le
roy
ye
es
madam
faltered
the
maid
weakly
leon
had
crossed
to
the
door
he
came
back
and
laid
his
strong
protecting
hand
gently
on
his
mother
shoulder
and
looked
down
into
her
troubled
face
mother
do
not
be
frightened
he
said
i
will
find
beatrix
for
you
ring
for
lights
and
let
clarice
stay
here
with
you
i
will
search
for
the
child
the
words
kindled
a
gleam
of
hope
in
her
breast
she
did
not
see
how
deathly
white
his
own
face
had
grown
he
left
her
and
went
out
into
the
grounds
on
his
mission
of
finding
the
missing
girl
a
new
moon
had
risen
piercing
the
twilight
darkness
with
shafts
of
mellow
light
in
its
mystic
rays
the
white
graveled
walks
and
groups
of
marble
statuary
glimmered
ghostly
pale
and
wan
clarice
apprehensive
words
rang
in
his
ears
i
am
afraid
she
has
thrown
herself
into
the
water
not
that
oh
not
that
he
said
to
himself
he
left
the
more
open
grounds
and
went
out
into
the
thick
shrubberies
the
dew
was
falling
heavily
and
the
fragrance
of
flowers
was
borne
on
the
air
the
almost
oppressive
sweetness
of
the
then
at
the
height
of
its
blooming
stole
gently
on
his
senses
but
ever
afterward
it
was
connected
in
his
mind
with
a
sense
of
loss
and
pain
beatrix
beatrix
he
called
ever
and
anon
in
his
eager
search
but
no
sweet
voice
replied
no
slender
form
bounded
out
from
among
the
dark
green
trees
he
felt
a
strange
sense
of
dreariness
in
his
search
for
cyril
wentworth
missing
love
she
was
very
unhappy
i
had
begun
to
forget
that
he
said
to
himself
she
had
changed
so
much
i
thought
she
was
beginning
to
forget
that
episode
with
cyril
wentworth
was
her
apparent
indifference
only
a
clever
mask
has
she
fled
with
him
he
crushed
something
like
a
bitter
execration
between
his
lips
at
the
thought
and
went
on
crashing
madly
through
the
shrubbery
and
so
came
out
into
the
quiet
dell
where
beatrix
had
hidden
that
evening
in
her
frantic
dread
of
ross
powell
he
followed
the
course
of
the
little
singing
stream
that
tried
to
tell
him
in
its
musical
murmur
she
is
here
she
is
here
but
he
was
deaf
to
nature
voice
his
heart
cry
drowned
it
why
am
i
seeking
her
here
he
muttered
bitterly
my
mother
was
right
she
has
had
too
much
liberty
cyril
wentworth
has
stolen
her
away
nay
a
sudden
gleam
of
the
silvery
moonlight
broke
through
the
interlacing
boughs
of
the
trees
and
touched
with
a
pencil
of
light
a
little
white
heap
of
something
huddled
under
the
bowering
trees
he
went
nearer
knelt
down
and
a
cry
of
joy
broke
from
his
stern
mustached
lips
chapter
xiv
she
had
not
thrown
herself
into
the
river
she
had
not
fled
with
her
lover
he
had
wronged
her
in
his
thoughts
she
was
here
like
a
weary
child
she
had
flung
herself
down
with
her
pale
cheek
pillowed
on
one
round
white
arm
and
was
sleeping
deeply
exhaustedly
with
the
flowers
all
fallen
from
her
apron
and
strewed
in
odorous
confusion
about
her
he
bent
his
dark
head
low
over
the
golden
one
perhaps
to
listen
if
she
slept
some
murmured
words
fell
from
his
lips
they
sounded
like
my
darling
but
it
must
have
been
the
wind
sighing
in
the
leaves
above
them
or
perchance
the
musical
ripple
of
the
little
streamlet
leon
le
roy
was
too
proud
and
cold
for
such
a
weakness
but
he
did
not
awake
her
at
once
he
bent
over
her
softly
and
the
shapely
hand
with
its
costly
diamond
flashing
in
the
moonlight
moved
gently
over
the
waving
ripples
of
golden
hair
in
mute
caress
as
though
she
had
been
a
child
how
still
and
pale
she
lay
the
white
radiance
of
the
moonlight
made
her
look
so
cold
and
white
it
thrilled
him
with
a
strange
terror
what
if
it
were
death
he
muttered
darkly
with
a
shiver
death

with
a
sudden
baleful
fierceness
what
then
better
death
than
surrender
her
to
cyril
wentworth
and
a
flame
of
jealousy
tore
his
heart
asunder
like
the
keen
blade
of
a
dagger
he
gazed
for
a
moment
in
almost
sullen
satisfaction
on
the
white
sleeping
face
then
suddenly
his
mood
changed
something
like
fear
and
dread
came
into
his
eyes
am
i
mad
he
asked
himself
with
a
bitter
in
his
voice
and
he
shook
her
gently
while
almost
unconsciously
he
called
her
name
aloud
beatrix
darling
with
a
start
she
opened
her
eyes
she
saw
him
bending
over
her
with
an
inscrutable
expression
upon
his
face
it
was
frowning
fierce
almost
bitterly
angry
yet
all
the
summer
night
around
her
her
languid
pulses
and
her
beating
heart
seemed
to
thrill
and
echo
to
one
sweet
fierce
whisper
darling
had
she
dreamed
it
was
it
but
the
figment
of
her
slumbering
brain
as
she
struggled
up
she
put
out
her
hands
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
his
face
that
seemed
to
frown
darkly
upon
her
a
cry
broke
from
her
lips
full
of
fear
and
deprecation
do
not
be
angry
do
not
scold
me
she
wailed
i
am
very
sorry
i
i
will
go
away
she
is
not
half
awake
she
is
dreaming
he
said
to
himself
and
he
touched
her
again
gently
wake
up
miss
gordon
he
said
you
are
dreaming
i
am
not
going
to
scold
you
although
you
have
given
us
all
a
terrible
scare
falling
asleep
in
the
grounds
at
this
hour
of
the
evening
the
somber
black
eyes
stared
at
him
affrightedly
she
did
not
comprehend
him
yet
oh
mr
le
roy
has
he
told
you
all
she
cried
clasping
her
small
hands
tightly
in
the
agony
of
her
excitement
do
you
hate
me
despise
me
must
i
go
away
all
alone
with
a
shudder
into
the
dark
dark
night
still
dreaming
said
leon
le
roy
to
himself
and
with
a
sudden
impulse
of
pity
he
bent
down
put
his
arms
about
the
small
white
figure
and
lifted
her
up
to
her
feet
then
holding
her
gently
in
the
clasp
of
one
arm
he
said
like
one
soothing
a
frightened
child
you
have
been
asleep
miss
gordon
and
your
dreams
were
wild
rouse
yourself
now
and
come
into
the
house
with
me
my
mother
is
greatly
frightened
at
your
absence
frightened
she
repeated
a
little
vaguely
and
nestling
unconsciously
nearer
to
the
warm
strong
arm
that
held
her
yes
you
have
been
missing
several
hours
and
we
have
all
had
a
great
fright
about
you
clarice
searched
for
you
several
hours
but
i
had
the
happiness
of
finding
you
he
said
gently
and
nothing
has
happened
you
are
not
angry
she
asked
the
mists
beginning
to
clear
from
her
brain
nothing
has
happened
except
that
a
gentleman
came
to
see
you
and
went
away
disappointed
i
am
not
angry
yet
i
ought
to
be
seeing
what
a
fright
you
gave
me
only
think
of
me
miss
gordon
rushing
about
the
garden
with
my
mind
full
of
imaginings
and
finding
you
asleep
on
the
grass
like
a
tired
baby
what
a
descent
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
she
began
to
comprehend
all
and
drew
herself
with
a
blush
from
the
arm
that
still
held
her
gently
pardon
me
you
were
half
asleep
and
i
held
you
to
keep
you
from
falling
he
said
with
cool
dignity
shall
we
return
to
the
house
now
my
mother
is
in
great
suspense
i
am
very
sorry
she
began
penitently
as
she
moved
on
quietly
by
his
side
i
did
not
mean
to
frighten
any
one
you
you
were
very
kind
to
come
and
look
for
me
in
her
heart
she
was
secretly
singing
pæans
of
gladness
she
was
not
discovered
yet
her
clever
move
that
evening
had
thrown
her
enemy
off
his
guard
trying
to
keep
the
tremor
out
of
her
voice
she
asked
with
apparent
carelessness
who
was
my
visitor
mr
le
roy
whom
do
you
imagine
he
responded
was
was
it
mr
wentworth
she
inquired
with
artless
innocence
and
something
in
her
voice
that
he
interpreted
as
hope
and
longing
do
you
suppose
that
wentworth
would
be
admitted
inside
the
doors
of
eden
he
inquired
with
grim
anger
why
not
said
she
timidly
you
must
know
that
we
have
our
instructions
from
your
mother
he
answered
stiffly
laurel
decided
that
it
would
be
in
keeping
with
her
character
of
beatrix
gordon
to
argue
the
point
a
little
with
mr
le
roy
do
you
not
think
that
mamma
is
a
little
harsh
mr
le
roy
she
ventured
timidly
wentworth
is
good
and
noble
and
handsome
his
only
fault
is
that
he
is
poor
therefore
he
is
no
mate
for
you
leon
answered
almost
savagely
but
why
she
persisted
longing
to
hear
his
opinion
on
the
subject
you
are
almost
too
young
to
understand
these
questions
miss
gordon
but
it
ought
to
be
perfectly
obvious
to
you
that
the
wealthy
daughter
of
gordon
should
not
descend
to
a
simple
clerk
without
connections
without
money
and
without
prospects
he
answered
almost
brusquely
must
one
take
no
account
of
love
she
asked
timidly
unequal
marriages
seldom
result
happily
miss
gordon
he
said
his
voice
full
of
underlying
bitterness
you
would
have
the
rich
to
always
wed
the
rich
then
she
said
smothering
a
long
deep
bitter
sigh
as
she
awaited
his
answer
other
things
being
equal
yes
he
responded
cruelly
and
for
a
time
they
walked
on
silently
through
the
moonlit
paths
with
the
thick
shrubberies
casting
fantastic
shadows
along
their
way
leon
was
in
a
savage
mood
laurel
in
a
bitter
one
she
was
silently
recalling
her
maid
favorite
song
dimes
and
dollars
dollars
and
dimes
an
empty
pocket
is
the
worst
of
crimes
if
a
man
down
give
him
a
thrust

the

an

the

the
popular

why

try
to
fight
against
it
she
asked
herself
with
a
sinking
heart
she
looked
up
into
the
dark
stern
face
beside
her
then
i
need
never
ask
you
to
feel
sorry
for
us
you
will
never
help
us
to
happiness
poor
cyril
and
me
she
said
his
dark
eyes
flashed
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
miss
gordon
he
said
almost
savagely
no
never
ask
me
to
help
you
to
happiness
with
cyril
wentworth
i
would
sooner
see
you
dead
she
shrunk
back
appalled
at
his
burst
of
resistless
passion
he
is
hard
and
cruel
proud
as
lucifer
and
cold
as
ice
she
sighed
inly
i
was
mad
to
dream
that
he
called
me
darling
in
my
sleep
one
of
those
stars
will
sooner
fall
from
the
heavens
than
that
he
should
descend
to
laurel
vane
they
were
at
the
foot
of
the
marble
steps
now
just
touching
her
arm
he
led
her
up
to
the
door
and
turned
away
you
may
go
in
alone
and
tell
them
the
ridiculous
finale
to
our
grand
scare
that
you
had
simply
fallen
asleep
on
the
grass
he
said
in
a
brusque
careless
tone
i
shall
go
down
to
the
river
and
smoke
my
cigar
and
no
wildest
stretch
of
her
girlish
fancy
could
have
made
her
believe
that
leon
le
roy
went
back
to
the
place
where
he
had
found
her
sleeping
that
he
took
into
his
hands
some
of
the
scattered
forgotten
flowers
on
which
her
arm
and
cheek
had
lain
that
he
kissed
them
and
hid
them
in
his
breast
and
then
almost
cursed
himself
for
his
folly
i
leon
le
roy
whom
the
fairest
proudest
women
in
the
world
have
loved
vainly
he
cried
i
to
make
myself
a
dolt
over
another
childish

chapter

laurel
went
slowly
into
the
house
and
was
received
with
joy
by
mrs
le
roy
and
clarice
she
was
touched
when
the
proud
stately
lady
kissed
her
warmly
on
the
lips
and
when
she
saw
the
trace
of
tears
in
the
dark
eyes
she
felt
conscience
stricken
and
ashamed
she
gives
all
this
tenderness
to
beatrix
gordon
the
daughter
of
her
old
friend
she
thought
sadly
if
she
knew
the
truth
she
would
hate
me
i
am
sorry
and
ashamed
to
think
that
i
have
created
a
sensation
for
nothing
she
said
with
frank
shame
the
truth
is
i
fell
asleep
in
a
secluded
part
of
the
grounds
and
i
do
not
know
when
i
should
have
awakened
if
mr
le
roy
had
not
found
me
the
maid
said
to
herself
that
it
was
surely
the
most
fortunate
nap
her
mistress
had
ever
taken
for
she
had
thus
escaped
meeting
clerk
she
little
dreamed
of
that
unfortunate
meeting
at
the
gates
of
eden
that
evening
between
ross
powell
and
the
false
beatrix
gordon
laurel
received
the
letter
and
the
packet
she
opened
the
latter
first
and
found
that
it
contained
a
beautiful
set
of
pearls
in
a
russia
leather
case
it
is
a
beautiful
gift
said
mrs
le
roy
who
was
a
critical
judge
of
jewels
it
is
a
pity
we
live
so
quietly
at
eden
you
will
have
no
chance
to
display
them
i
shall
have
to
give
a
or
a
reception
oh
pray
do
not
at
least
on
my
account
panted
laurel
growing
crimson
and
frightened
all
at
once
i
should
not
like
it
indeed
that
is
i
mean
mamma
would
not
i
have
not
come
out
yet
you
know
very
well
my
dear
i
shall
not
do
so
unless
you
wish
i
am
rather
pleased
that
you
do
not
care
for
it
for
i
am
rather
fond
of
seclusion
and
quiet
myself
but
i
fancied
it
must
be
very
dull
for
a
pretty
young
girl
like
you
replied
mrs
le
roy
kindly
dull
cried
laurel
with
shining
eyes
i
have
never
been
so
happy
anywhere
in
my
life
but
she
said
to
herself
that
she
would
never
wear
the
jewels
the
beautiful
shining
pearls
never
she
would
send
them
at
the
first
opportunity
to
the
true
beatrix
gordon
and
while
mrs
le
roy
pondered
delightedly
over
her
impulsive
words
laurel
opened
and
read
gordon
letter
when
she
had
finished
she
sat
for
some
little
time
in
silence
musing
gravely
with
her
small
hands
locked
together
in
her
lap
does
your
letter
trouble
you
beatrix
asked
mrs
le
roy
seeing
how
grave
and
anxious
she
looked
the
girl
looked
up
mamma
and
papa
are
about
to
take
a
little
southern
trip
for
the
benefit
of
mamma
health
she
said
mamma
dreads
the
beginning
of
autumn
in
new
york
the
changeable
weather
affects
her
lungs
unpleasantly
she
has
written
to
ask
if
i
would
like
to
accompany
them
i
have
received
a
letter
of
the
same
import
from
gordon
answered
the
lady
she
allows
you
to
take
your
choice
in
the
matter
to
go
with
her
or
to
remain
at
eden
with
me
until
she
returns
laurel
gave
her
a
wistful
inquiring
glance
from
her
expressive
eyes
the
lady
interpreted
it
aright
i
shall
be
happy
if
you
elect
to
remain
with
me
that
long
my
child
she
answered
cordially
in
answer
to
that
mute
question
then
i
shall
stay
with
you
i
do
not
want
to
go
away
from
beautiful
eden
cried
laurel
quickly
thank
you
my
dear
i
am
gratified
by
your
preference
mrs
le
roy
answered
smilingly
little
more
than
two
months
ago
mrs
le
roy
had
been
vexed
beyond
measure
at
the
intrusion
of
this
stranger
into
her
sacred
family
circle
now
the
girl
untutored
graces
had
won
their
way
into
her
heart
and
she
saw
with
pleasure
that
leon
first
studied
avoidance
of
the
intruder
had
given
way
to
a
mild
toleration
that
sometimes
even
relaxed
into
genial
courtesy
the
stately
lady
had
her
own
plans
and
it
was
no
part
of
them
for
beatrix
gordon
to
leave
her
now
she
had
written
to
gordon
and
confided
her
plans
to
her
meeting
with
that
lady
cordial
approval
their
mutual
desires
and
plans
for
beatrix
boded
no
good
certainly
to

laurel
heart
beat
with
sudden
fear
and
dread
when
she
heard
that
ross
powell
was
coming
again
to
eden
but
clarice
gave
her
unperceived
a
swift
telegraphic
look
implying
that
she
would
manage
that
all
right
and
laurel
confident
in
the
cleverness
of
the
maid
felt
her
beating
heart
grow
calmer
and
her
nervousness
subside
when
laurel
went
to
her
room
that
night
she
wrote
to
gordon
thanking
her
for
the
gift
of
the
beautiful
pearls
and
expressing
her
desire
to
remain
at
eden
during
the
southern
tour
clarice
who
in
addition
to
her
other
accomplishments
was
a
clever
chirographist
copied
this
letter
over
into
a
clever
imitation
of
beatrix
writing
and
made
it
all
ready
for
powell
when
he
should
call
for
it
the
next
day
laurel
did
not
appear
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
and
clarice
carried
her
excuses
to
mrs
le
roy
with
the
most
innocent
air
in
the
world
her
young
mistress
had
contracted
a
severe
headache
from
her
unwitting
nap
in
the
night
air
and
dew
the
previous
evening
it
was
a
very
natural
sequence
no
one
dreamed
of
doubting
it
a
delicate
repast
of
tea
and
toast
was
sent
up
to
the
sufferer
who
spent
the
day
on
her
soft
couch
in
a
darkened
room
and
was
of
course
quite
too
unwell
to
see
her
visitor
when
he
called
ross
powell
received
the
letters
for
gordon
and
went
away
without
giving
much
thought
to
the
fact
that
he
had
not
seen
miss
gordon
his
mind
was
far
more
exercised
over
the
fact
that
he
had
been
utterly
unable
to
find
laurel
vane
chapter
xvi
gordon
was
not
sorry
that
her
daughter
had
preferred
to
stay
at
eden
in
preference
to
accompanying
her
upon
her
southern
tour
it
augured
well
for
the
success
of
the
trembling
hopes
which
she
entertained
in
common
with
mrs
le
roy
she
sent
down
a
letter
full
of
affectionate
regrets
over
their
temporary
separation
and
followed
it
by
a
box
full
of
new
dresses
and
hats
over
which
clarice
went
into
ecstasies
of
delight
and
laurel
wept
i
can
never
wear
them
do
not
ask
me
clarice
she
said
they
make
me
feel
like
a
traitor
it
is
enough
that
i
have
borrowed
miss
name
i
can
not
take
the
nice
things
they
sent
her
too
i
should
feel
like
a
thief
la
me
my
dear
i
never
saw
anybody
equal
to
you
for
calling
a
spade
a
spade
cried
pretty
clarice
now
i
think
you
are
too
hard
upon
yourself
really
you
will
have
to
wear
some
of
these
pretty
things
to
keep
up
appearances
as
miss
gordon
the
things
you
brought
with
you
and
the
few
dresses
miss
beatrix
spared
you
from
her
wardrobe
are
getting
shabby
and
i
afraid
these
proud
rich
people
here
think
that
your
pa
dresses
you
too
poorly
for
your
station
besides
this
is
september
and
you
can
not
go
on
wearing
muslins
and
cambrics
and
all
winter
i
will
wear
them
as
long
as
i
can
at
least
sighed
laurel
besides
clarice
who
can
tell
how
soon
our
little
comedy
may
be
played
out
how
soon
miss
wentworth
may
be
ready
to
confess
her
clever
conspiracy
the
maid
wondered
a
little
at
the
note
of
vague
regret
in
laurel
tone
the
day
came
when
she
understood
the
time
to
which
they
looked
forward
came
sooner
than
they
thought
in
a
week
after
the
gordons
went
south
a
letter
arrived
for
laurel
under
cover
of
an
envelope
addressed
to
clarice
wells
it
was
from
cyril
wentworth
fair
young
bride
who
had
been
hidden
away
securely
in
brooklyn
all
this
time
her
husband
pursuing
his
daily
occupation
in
new
york
and
returning
in
the
evening
to
his
sweet
stolen
bride
no
one
ever
suspecting
that
the
handsome
young
bachelor
whom
the
gordons
dreaded
so
much
had
become
a
benedick
my
sweet
little
laurel
wrote
grateful
happy
beatrix
the
time
of

been
plotting

cleverly
ever
since
he
started
me
to
eden
to
hide
me
from
my
darling
cyril
it
a
splendid
chance
for
a
young
man

insure

a
competence
if
not
a
fortune

heart
is
singing
pæans
of
gladness
over
our
happy
prospects
i
can
not
be
grateful
enough
to
you
for
playing
your
part
so
well
until
this
happy
conclusion

three
days

for

to
go
with
me
and
i

come

laurel
cyril
is
not
rich
but
we
will
care
for
you

darling
and
you
shall
be
like
my
own
little
sister
until
some
fortunate
man
claims
you
for
his
lovely
bride
you
and
clarice
must
come
at
once
dear
as
we
have
no
time
to
lose
and
cyril
has
already
taken
our
passages
on
the
steamer
i
sold
my
diamonds
to
pay
for
them
so
you
may
know
by
that
little
laurel
how
anxious
i
am
to
have
you
come
do
not
delay
invent
some
clever
excuse
for
leaving
and
come
at
once
to
my
address
in
brooklyn
you
need
not
own
up
to
our
little
conspiracy
dear
i
know
you
would
be
too
frightened

that
to
me
when
we
are
on
the
eve
of
starting
i
will
write
to
the
le
roys
and
to
papa
and
mamma
confessing
all
and
imploring
their
forgiveness
clarice
went
almost
wild
over
that
letter
she
was
full
of
joy
that
the
clever
little
conspiracy
had
worked
out
so
successfully
and
the
promised
tour
to
europe
was
the
realization
of
the
dream
of
her
life
i
do
not
believe
that
we
can
invent
any
good
excuse
for
leaving
eden
she
said
thoughtfully
they
would
not
allow
us
gordon
orders
have
been
too
strict
we
must
steal
away
miss
vane
and
we
can
telegraph
them
to
send
our
luggage
do
you
not
think
that
will
be
the
better
plan
to
get
away
she
looked
at
laurel
who
had
never
spoken
one
word
yet
the
girl
was
crouching
in
a
low
seat
like
one
overwhelmed
with
sudden
grief
she
lifted
a
white
face
full
of
desperate
trouble
and
somber
heavy
dark
eyes
up
to
clarice
oh
clarice
do
not
ask
me
she
wailed
i
do
not
want
to
go
i
can
not
i
will
not
leave
eden
and
with
that
passionate
denial
laurel
vane
little
feet
turned
aside
into
that
luring
path
of
sin
whose
roses
hide
so
many
cruel
thorns
chapter

i
do
not

repeated
the

wells
gazed
at
the
pale
face
and
somber
dark
eyes
in
alarm
had
this
sudden
good
news
turned
the
young
lady
brain
she
went
up
to
laurel
and
shook
her
gently
by
the
arm
miss
vane
i
do
not
think
you
understand
she
said
your
probation
here
is
over
we
do
not
need
to
keep
up
this
wretched
farce
any
longer
wentworth
has
secured
his
fine
appointment
abroad
and
his
wife
wishes
for
us
to
go
with
her
do
you
realize
it
miss
vane
to
go
abroad
to
be
like
the
sister
of
wentworth
is
it
not
a
glorious
reward
for
the
service
you
have
done
her
but
laurel
gazing
drearily
before
her
into
vacancy
answered
obstinately
i
understand
it
all
clarice
but
i
would
rather
stay
at
eden
but
why
miss
asked
the
maid
astonished
and
half
indignant
laurel
glancing
up
saw
the
wonder
in
her
eyes
and
suddenly
blushed
a
hot
burning
crimson
the
news
had
taken
her
by
surprise
and
she
had
spoken
out
unthinkingly
on
being
confronted
with
this
very
pertinent
question
from
clarice
she
suddenly
realized
her
error
but
why
miss
vane
persisted
clarice
why
should
you
wish
to
stay
at
eden
when
you
are
in
danger
of
detection
every
hour
i
love
the
place
i
would
rather
risk
detection
than
go
away
faltered
laurel
miserably
well
i
surprised
declared
the
maid
in
genuine
consternation
i
thought
you
were
miserable
here
and
that
you
would
rejoice
to
get
away
i
can
not
see
what
has
changed
you
so
it
is
possible
miss
vane
a
sudden
suspicion
darting
into
her
mind
that
you
have
lost
your
heart
to
the
master
of
eden
speechless
and
shame
stricken
laurel
hid
her
hot
face
in
her
hands
and
clarice
went
on
admonishing
if
you
have
you
had
best
come
away
with
me
and
think
no
more
of
it
my
dear
young
lady
loving
a
man
like
mr
le
roy
mostly
means
ruin
and
destruction
to
a
poor
girl
like
you
if
you
stay
they
will
be
sure
to
find
you
out
and
then
what
is
to
become
of
you
these
proud
le
roys
will
be
fit
to
kill
you
for
deceiving
them
so
you
had
better
go
and
fling
yourself
into
the
river
yonder
than
waste
your
heart
on
leon
le
roy
laurel
sprung
to
her
feet
her
small
hands
clinched
her
dark
eyes
suddenly
blazing
hush
she
cried
how
dare
you
accuse
me
of
loving
leon
le
roy
it
is
false
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
folly
i
will
not
have
you
talk
so
to
me
clarice
is
there
no
reason
i
should
want
to
stay
but
that
i
cared
for
him
do
i
not
love
his
grand
beautiful
home
do
i
not
love
the
stately
lady
who
has
been
so
kind
to
me
i
would
rather
be
mrs
le
roy
servant
than
go
away
ended
beautiful
laurel
wildly
she
would
not
have
you
for
her
servant
even
if
once
she
found
out
the
truth
about
you
argued
sensible
clarice
miss
vane
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
of
this
sudden
fancy
of
yours
what
would
miss
beatrix
i
mean
wentworth
say
if
she
could
hear
you
clarice
i
have
served
her
ends
and
she
can
have
no
right
to
reproach
me
if
i
take
my
own
way
now
said
the
girl
and
indeed
it
is
far
better
for
me
not
to
go
wentworth
is
a
poor
man
why
should
i
burden
him
with
my
support
they
will
do
better
without
me
oh
clarice
dear
kind
clarice
she
flung
herself
suddenly
on
her
knees
before
the
perplexed
maid
and
grasped
her
dress
imploringly
let
me
have
my
way
in
this
go
to
wentworth
and
leave
me
here
beg
her
not
to
betray
the
conspiracy
yet
tell
her
to
be
kind
to
me
to
let
me
stay
as
long
as
i
can
before
they
find
me
out
in
my
wickedness
and
then
said
clarice
gravely
what
will
you
do
after
that
then
the
deluge
laurel
answered
recklessly
they
spent
an
hour
in
heated
argument
laurel
was
desperately
resolved
not
to
leave
eden
if
possible
her
tears
her
prayers
conquered
clarice
better
judgment
the
end
of
it
all
was
that
clarice
gave
in
to
her
plans
and
promised
to
influence
beatrix
wentworth
to
withhold
her
promised
letters
of
confession
to
the
gordons
and
the
le
roys
but
i
must
say
one
thing
miss
vane
in
spite
of
your
anger
said
the
maid
sturdily
if
you
have
laid
a
plan
to
marry
the
master
of
eden
i
will
betray
you
if
it
is
at
the
front
of
the
altar
you
must
not
dare
carry
the
farce
that
far
you
are
beautiful
and
young
but
you
are
no
mate
for
the
proud
rich
master
of
eden
if
you
married
him
and
he
found
out
the
cheat
afterward
he
would
make
you
the
most
wretched
woman
under
the
sun
afterward
laurel
recalled
the
maid
words
as
if
they
had
been
some
fateful
prophecy
instead
of
the
wise
utterance
of
a
woman
you
need
not
threaten
me
clarice
she
said
with
girlish
dignity
i
have
laid
no
plans
not
one
i
have
not
thought
about
the
future
i
only
could
not
bear
to
go
away
i
know
mr
le
roy
could
never
think
of
me
way
i
have
never
even
dreamed
of
it
do
not
judge
me
so
harshly
clarice
remember
how
young
i
am
is
it
strange
that
i
should
love
the
only
happy
home
i
ever
had
clarice
could
not
resist
her
beauty
her
pleadings
her
distress
she
smoothed
the
golden
hair
tenderly
and
kissed
the
white
hands
and
admitted
that
she
was
sorry
for
laurel
vane
but
she
said
to
herself
all
the
same
that
she
was
acting
wrong
in
leaving
the
girl
at
eden
in
her
borrowed
plumes
harm
would
come
of
it
harm
to
the
beautiful
willful
creature
who
was
so
blindly
rushing
upon
her
fate
that
evening
laurel
told
mrs
le
roy
that
clarice
had
received
an
offer
to
accompany
a
lady
to
europe
and
that
the
girl
had
determined
to
accept
it
and
would
leave
her
on
the
next
day
to
go
to
new
york
you
shall
have
my
own
maid
to
help
you
every
day
until
you
find
a
new
one
said
mrs
le
roy
cordially
and
laurel
thanking
her
said
that
she
did
not
require
the
services
of
a
maid
very
much
and
she
would
not
engage
another
until
she
returned
to
new
york
clarice
wells
went
away
the
next
morning
full
of
joy
at
the
prospect
before
her
but
regretful
at
leaving
laurel
she
fancied
that
the
girl
would
fare
but
ill
at
the
hands
of
the
le
roys
when
they
found
her
out
laurel
sent
the
beautiful
pearls
gordon
gift
to
beatrix
wentworth
with
her
love
and
best
wishes
the
maid
declined
to
take
the
new
hats
and
dresses
to
her
mistress
you
will
need
them
if
you
are
going
to
keep
up
this
masquerade
she
said
and
when
they
turn
you
adrift
upon
the
world
you
can
sell
them
for
money
to
buy
food
and
shelter
she
went
away
and
in
the
new
loneliness
that
fell
upon
her
laurel
vane
began
to
realize
dimly
to
what
imminent
perils
she
had
willfully
committed
herself
chapter
xviii
clarice
had
barely
gone
a
week
when
one
evening
mrs
le
roy
came
sailing
into
the
whither
laurel
had
gone
to
dress
for
dinner
but
was
dreaming
instead
at
the
open
window
my
dear
we
have
company
from
new
york
she
said
rather
abruptly
laurel
started
and
turned
a
pale
frightened
face
toward
the
lady
new
york
she
faltered
tremblingly
with
her
heart
on
her
lips
a
moment
ago
she
had
been
careless
almost
light
hearted
as
she
leaned
from
the
window
and
watched
the
shadows
of
twilight
falling
on
the
river
and
the
beautiful
grounds
she
had
inhaled
the
air
with
something
like
delight
she
had
been
murmuring
to
herself
some
pretty
lines
of
jean
ingelow
i
leaned
out
of
window
i
smelt
the
white
clover
dark
dark
was
the
garden
i
saw
not
the
gate
now
if
there
be
footsteps
he
comes
my
one
lover
hush
nightingale
hush
o
sweet
nightingale
wait
till
i
listen
and
hear
if
a
step
draweth
near
for
my
love
he
is
late
the
murmured
words
of
the
had
died
on
the
sweet
lips
now
they
were
white
with
fear
as
she
turned
to
mrs
le
roy
my
child
you
need
not
look
so
startled
she
laughed
my
guests
will
not
eat
you
then
laurel
knew
that
she
had
almost
betrayed
herself
she
rallied
her
sinking
spirits
with
a
great
effort
of
will
i
rather
startled
when
you
said
new
york
i
thought
of
so
many
whom
i
knew
she
said
apologetically
is
it
any
one
who
knows
me
mrs
le
roy
she
asked
quivering
with
secret
fear
no
my
dear
but
it
is
a
lady
who
moves
in
the
highest
circles
of
fashionable
society
in
new
york
an
old
friend
of
mine
and
leon
a
beautiful
young
widow
she
is
now
she
ran
down
quite
informally
upon
us
to
bring
a
friend
a
titled
foreigner
to
see
our
beautiful
eden
laurel
began
to
take
heart
again
now
she
listened
with
a
smile
while
the
lady
continued
you
will
not
take
it
amiss
in
your
mother
old
friend
beatrix
if
i
suggest
that
you
make
your
dinner
toilet
more
elaborate
than
usual
you
are
always
lovely
dear
seeing
the
pale
cheeks
crimson
suddenly
in
the
simplest
things
you
wear
but
to
do
honor
to
our
guests
and
justice
to
your
own
rare
beauty
i
want
you
to
look
your
loveliest
i
want
to
help
you
select
a
robe
from
among
the
new
ones
your
mother
sent
may
i
dear
with
a
coaxing
smile
they
do
not
fit
they
are
all
too
large
i
think
faltered
laurel
i
will
send
my
maid
she
can
make
the
necessary
alterations
in
a
few
minutes
i
am
waiting
dear
to
help
you
select
your
robe
if
you
will
allow
me
said
mrs
le
roy
with
gentle
persistence
and
laurel
had
to
yield
they
looked
through
the
dresses
and
selected
one
of
white
satin
and
spanish
lace
simple
enough
for
a
young
girl
yet
exquisitely
elaborate
and
becoming
if
you
will
wear
this
with
the
beautiful
pearls
your
mother
sent
you
will
be
simply
peerless
said
mrs
le
roy
laurel
could
not
confess
that
she
had
sent
the
pearls
away
when
mrs
le
roy
was
gone
and
the
maid
was
altering
the
she
slipped
out
and
gathered
her
hands
full
of
deep
scarlet
jacqueminot
roses
will
not
these
roses
look
well
with
the
white
dress
she
asked
the
stylish
french
maid
rather
timidly
superb
pronounced
mademoiselle
with
enthusiasm
and
when
the
dress
was
on
and
the
great
clusters
of
scarlet
roses
gleamed
against
the
white
breast
and
in
the
rippling
curls
of
burnished
gold
the
maid
could
not
repress
an
exclamation
of
delight
nothing
could
have
been
lovelier
than
the
girl
in
the
white
dress
with
the
fragrant
scarlet
roses
mademoiselle
did
not
know
that
the
girl
hated
herself
with
a
passionate
contempt
as
she
looked
down
at
her
beautiful
borrowed
plumage
feathers
make
fine
birds
she
said
to
herself
bitterly
as
she
went
down
the
stairs
to
the
brilliantly
lighted
holding
her
small
head
high
to
hide
the
tremor
at
her
heart
she
opened
the
door
and
entered
mrs
le
roy
was
there
talking
to
a
handsome
young
man
beyond
them
she
saw
leon
with
his
dark
head
bent
over
a
beautiful
woman
at
the
piano
her
white
jeweled
hands
flew
swiftly
over
the
pearl
keys
and
she
was
singing
to
him
in
a
high
clear
soprano
voice
oh
my
lost
love
and
my
own
own
love
and
my
love
who
loved
me
so
chapter
xix
laurel
drew
back
on
the
threshold
fearful
of
interrupting
the
singer
but
mrs
le
roy
had
already
perceived
her
and
came
forward
with
considerable
to
draw
her
into
the
room
and
introduce
her
miss
gordon
count
fitz
john
she
said
and
with
a
gasp
as
if
some
one
had
thrown
cold
water
over
her
the
false
beatrix
gordon
found
herself
bowing
to
a
real
live
french
count
her
trepidation
passed
away
in
a
moment
the
count
was
not
at
all
imposing
a
young
fellow
enough
but
leon
le
roy
overtopped
him
by
head
and
shoulders
in
size
and
manly
beauty
laurel
sat
down
shyly
conscious
of
his
palpable
admiration
and
when
the
song
had
come
to
an
end
she
was
presented
to
the
singer
a
shimmer
of
azure
silk
a
gleam
of
jewels
a
waft
of
overpowering
perfume
and
laurel
dared
raise
her
eyes
to
the
beautiful
blonde
face
with
its
turquois
blue
eyes
its
pink
cheeks
and
smiling
lips
a
halo
of
pale
golden
hair
framing
it
all
and
lending
an
air
of
infantile
innocence
to
its
beauty
she
looked
very
young
and
she
was
smaller
than
laurel
a
wax
doll
dainty
and
diminutive
and
with
a
smile
as
sweet
and
inane
she
did
not
look
like
a
widow
it
seemed
strange
to
call
her
merivale
the
blue
eyes
for
all
their
infantile
softness
gave
laurel
a
piercing
look
as
they
touched
each
other
hands
a
blonde
labeled
dangerous
said
merivale
to
herself
enviously
and
feeling
for
a
moment
doubtful
over
the
effect
of
her
own
elaborate
costume
as
compared
with
this
pure
white
robe
with
its
vivid
garniture
of
roses
but
in
a
moment
her
natural
vanity
reasserted
itself
she
concluded
to
be
gracious
i
am
so
glad
to
know
you
miss
gordon
i
have
heard
of
you
in
new
york
although
rumor
did
not
credit
you
with
half
the
charms
i
find
you
in
actual
possession
of
she
twittered
sweetly
will
you
come
to
the
piano
and
play
for
us
i
am
so
fond
of
music
i
do
not
play
laurel
answered
feeling
the
warm
color
flood
her
cheeks
under
the
lady
astonished
gaze
not
play
why
surely
began
merivale
but
to
laurel
intense
relief
dinner
was
announced
and
she
was
spared
the
expression
of
the
lady
surprise
at
her
ignorance
yet
she
looked
at
the
pearl
keys
longingly
as
she
swept
past
the
grand
piano
on
the
count
arm
she
had
a
great
passionate
love
for
the
divine
art
of
music
and
a
great
grief
filled
her
soul
at
the
thought
that
her
hands
had
no
power
to
wake
the
soul
of
harmony
slumbering
in
those
silent
keys
poor
papa
i
wish
that
he
had
taught
me
more
of
music
and
less
of
languages
she
thought
regretfully
yet
when
at
dinner
they
talked
in
the
french
language
out
of
compliment
to
the
polite
count
she
was
glad
that
she
could
hold
her
own
among
them
she
felt
rather
than
saw
leon
surprise
and
merivale
dismay
so
she
can
speak
french
like
a
native
although
she
can
not
play
curious
said
the
latter
to
herself
with
a
feeling
of
vexation
for
she
had
started
the
ball
of
french
conversation
with
a
distinct
view
to
miss
gordon
discomfiture
laurel
had
never
seen
mr
le
roy
so
brilliant
as
he
was
this
evening
it
seemed
that
he
had
never
exerted
himself
for
her
he
was
affable
courteous
fascinating
to
his
visitors
especially
so
to
the
lady
he
had
softly
spoken
words
for
her
winning
smiles
that
laurel
had
never
dreamed
could
curve
those
sternly
set
lips
a
pang
of
bitterness
pierced
the
sensitive
heart
of
the
lovely
young
impostor
he
has
never
thought
beatrix
gordon
worthy
of
his
kind
words
and
smiles
she
thought
he
did
not
think
so
now
it
seemed
he
did
not
speak
to
her
seldom
looked
at
her
his
words
and
looks
were
lavished
on
the
fair
smiling
widow
who
gave
herself
up
to
the
flirtation
with
eager
absorbing
interest
the
count
paid
great
attention
to
laurel
and
she
tried
to
look
interested
in
his
conversation
but
she
was
glad
when
the
dinner
was
ended
and
the
ladies
passed
from
the
room
leaving
the
gentlemen
to
finish
their
wine
merivale
went
to
the
low
window
and
looked
out
upon
the
moonlit
balcony
how
lovely
it
is
she
cried
will
you
come
out
mrs
le
roy
you
and
miss
gordon
beatrix
may
go
i
am
afraid
of
the
night
air
mrs
le
roy
responded
settling
herself
in
an
will
you
come
miss
gordon
asked
the
fair
widow
it
is
too
lovely
a
night
to
remain
indoors
she
added
sentimentally
laurel
went
out
to
her
and
merivale
drew
her
ringed
hand
lovingly
through
the
girl
arm
let
us
go
out
and
gather
some
roses
with
the
moonlight
and
dew
upon
them
they
will
be
so
sweet
she
said
winningly
and
please
will
you
call
me
maud
and
let
me
call
you
beatrix
we
are
both
too
young
to
be
ceremonious
with
each
other
they
went
down
into
the
graveled
paths
where
the
september
moonlight
shone
clear
and
white
and
then
maud
merivale
seemed
to
forget
all
about
the
roses
i
am
dying
to
know
how
you
like
the
count
she
cried
he
is
very
nice
i
suppose
said
laurel
vaguely
her
thoughts
elsewhere
nice
oh
dear
what
faint
praise
for
my
gallant
adorer
laughed
the
lady
why
my
dear
beatrix
all
the
girls
in
new
york
vote
him
a
love
a
darling
an
adonis
and
above
all
a
splendid
catch
they
are
all
jealous
of
me
any
one
of
them
could
willingly
cut
my
ears
off
for
having
taken
him
captive
then
you
are
to
marry
him
said
innocent
laurel
taking
a
vague
pleasure
in
the
thought
as
suggested
by
the
lady
words
i
can
marry
him
if
i
choose
laughed
the
lady
you
must
have
observed
how
devoted
he
is
laurel
had
observed
it
but
she
wisely
said
nothing
maud
merivale
shook
her
golden
frizzes
in
the
moonlight
i
shall
not
marry
him
it
is
useless
his
breaking
his
heart
over
me
she
said
i
am
too
true
to
my
old
love
your
dead
husband
laurel
said
gently
pshaw
beatrix
impatiently
what
are
you
talking
of
do
you
not
know
that
merivale
was
an
old
man
it
was
not
at
all
a
love
match
it
was
because
he
was
rich
pardon
laurel
murmured
faintly
and
she
recalled
to
herself
as
she
often
did
clarice
favorite
song
of
dollars
and
dimes
it
is
all
right
the
old
man
died
soon
and
left
me
a
fortune
said
the
young
widow
heartlessly
but
as
for
loving
him
or
having
any
sentimental
over
his
memory
pshaw
i
am
not
such
a
little
simpleton
as
that
my
dear
no
one
could
expect
it
plaintively
beatrix
this
with
startling
suddenness
tell
me
what
do
you
think
of
your
host
of
leon
le
roy
chapter
xx
the
change
of
conversation
was
so
sudden
that
laurel
started
and
shivered
uncomfortably
are
you
cold
my
dear
asked
maud
merivale
i
felt
chilly
for
a
moment
laurel
answered
it
does
not
matter
you
were
saying
i
asked
you
what
you
thought
of
leon
le
roy
beatrix
is
he
not
enthusiastically
grand
handsome
noble
a
very
king
among
men
little
thrills
of
icy
coldness
shot
along
laurel
tingling
nerves
she
remembered
his
cold
proud
bearing
to
her
as
contrasted
with
his
winning
and
tender
demeanor
to
maud
merivale
that
evening
she
answered
with
impulsive
bitterness
he
may
be
all
that
to
you
merivale
but
to
me
he
has
always
seemed
cold
hard
stern
poor
st
leon
ah
i
know
who
warped
his
generous
nature
so
sighed
the
lady
beatrix
i
am
so
fond
of
you
i
have
a
mind
to
tell
you
my
story
mine
and
st
leon
they
paced
back
and
forth
in
the
fine
clear
moonlight
their
rich
robes
shining
in
the
night
the
fragrance
of
flowers
all
about
them
the
sound
of
the
river
in
their
ears
a
hand
of
ice
seemed
to
clutch
laurel
heart
in
its
fierce
grasp
she
could
find
no
words
in
which
to
answer
you
have
heard
that
we
were
old
friends
leon
and
i
they
have
surely
told
you
that
dear
went
on
maud
merivale
sweet
insidious
voice
beatrix
in
the
olden
times
we
were
more
than
that
we
were
lovers
lovers
echoed
laurel
low
sad
voice
we
were
lovers
repeated
merivale
in
a
tone
of
triumph
but
we
were
both
very
young
and
well
old
midas
merivale
was
even
richer
than
leon
my
parents
were
poor
and
so
they
parted
me
from
my
young
lover
and
sold
me
to
that
old
man
for
his
sordid
gold
there
was
a
plaintive
quiver
in
the
cooing
voice
and
laurel
heart
suddenly
went
out
to
the
lovely
victim
in
tender
sympathy
after
my
marriage
i
did
not
see
leon
for
years
continued
the
sweet
tones
but
they
told
me
he
had
changed
that
he
had
grown
hard
cynical
cold
that
he
cared
nothing
for
women
save
to
rail
at
them
but
i
am
free
at
last
and
you
see
for
yourself
that
he
unbends
to
me
as
to
none
other
the
old
love
still
burns
in
his
heart
i
shall
win
him
back
beatrix
and
this
time
no
one
shall
come
between
us
maud
called
a
strong
sweet
voice
coming
down
the
marble
steps
i
am
here
leon
she
answered
back
gladly
this
pretty
beatrix
here
promised
me
some
roses
all
sweet
with
moonlight
and
dew
but
she
has
not
given
me
one
you
shall
give
them
to
me
st
leon
he
came
out
to
them
his
handsome
dark
head
bare
in
the
moonlight
a
smile
in
his
eyes
and
on
his
lips
subtly
sweet
and
dangerous
as
he
sometimes
willed
it
to
be
miss
gordon
will
you
go
into
the
house
with
the
count
and
my
mother
he
said
looking
straight
into
the
girl
dark
eyes
i
will
find
the
roses
sweet
with
moonlight
and
dew
laurel
bowed
silently
and
turned
away
she
did
not
turn
her
head
but
she
knew
that
the
widow
had
taken
leon
arm
and
was
walking
across
the
velvety
greensward
with
him
the
echo
of
firm
tones
and
happy
laughter
floated
back
to
her
she
did
not
go
back
to
the
count
and
mrs
le
roy
as
she
had
been
bidden
at
once
she
sat
down
at
the
foot
of
the
marble
steps
and
laid
her
hot
brow
wearily
down
on
the
cold
white
stone
their
words
hurt
me
here
she
murmured
pressing
her
small
hand
on
her
beating
heart
but
i
can
not
understand
why
it
should
be
so
why
should
their
love
pain
me
i
care
nothing
for
either
of
them
they
are
nothing
to
me
but
oh
this
terrible
pain
at
my
heart
what
does
it
mean
the
slight
form
shivered
and
trembled
the
beautiful
face
was
deathly
white
in
the
moonlight
she
rested
there
silently
a
long
time
looking
down
with
sharpened
mental
vision
into
her
own
heart
and
suddenly
a
moan
of
intense
and
bitter
despair
trembled
over
the
beautiful
girlish
lips
i
have
been
willfully
blind
i
have
not
understood
till
now
she
moaned
but
by
the
flash
of
jealousy
and
grief
i
have
seen
my
heart
clarice
was
right
and
i
spoke
falsely
when
i
denied
her
i
love
him
that
haughty
handsome
man
who
has
never
given
me
one
thought
who
belongs
to
maud
merivale
that
is
why
i
risked
all
to
remain
at
eden
oh
god
how
hard
it
is
to
read
my
own
heart
first
by
its
jealousy
and
aching
and
the
night
winds
and
the
river
echoed
her
faint
despairing
moan
chapter
xxi
after
a
little
she
dragged
herself
up
wearily
and
went
back
to
the
the
young
count
brightened
visibly
at
her
appearance
mrs
le
roy
told
her
that
she
had
stayed
out
too
long
in
the
night
air
and
dew
you
look
as
cold
and
white
as
the
moonlight
she
said
laurel
made
her
some
careless
answer
and
sat
down
count
fitz
john
engaged
her
in
conversation
he
was
delighted
to
find
some
one
who
could
converse
fairly
in
his
native
tongue
and
he
never
wearied
of
gazing
on
her
rare
type
of
beauty
and
her
tasteful
dress
that
appealed
so
forcibly
to
his
artistic
eye
he
admired
her
perhaps
all
the
more
that
she
piqued
him
a
little
by
her
quietness
and
girlish
dignity
she
was
not
flattered
by
his
notice
as
other
girls
were
on
the
contrary
if
he
had
not
been
rather
he
must
have
seen
that
she
was
decidedly
bored
leon
and
his
fair
guest
came
in
almost
an
hour
later
laurel
did
not
look
up
at
their
entrance
though
she
felt
her
cheeks
growing
hot
with
the
bitter
wonder
that
was
in
her
mind
did
leon
le
roy
suspect
that
she
cared
for
him
had
he
fathomed
the
secret
of
her
heart
before
she
really
understood
it
herself
was
that
the
secret
of
his
coldness
his
almost
harshness
to
her
had
he
used
this
rough
discourtesy
to
break
or
blunt
her
passion
the
hot
color
flashed
into
her
sensitive
face
she
tried
not
to
hear
his
clear
firm
voice
as
he
talked
to
merivale
to
drown
those
tones
she
was
obliged
to
listen
attentively
to
the
count
and
to
talk
more
herself
she
roused
herself
to
almost
vivacity
she
be
gay
no
one
should
guess
how
her
heart
was
bleeding
she
succeeded
so
well
in
her
efforts
that
the
frenchman
was
delighted
he
thought
that
he
had
at
last
begun
to
make
an
impression
on
the
lovely
girl
and
laurel
never
glancing
toward
the
others
did
not
know
with
what
a
frowning
brow
leon
watched
her
apparent
coquetries
but
the
interminable
evening
was
over
at
last
laurel
could
never
have
told
how
she
got
through
it
but
at
last
they
had
all
gone
to
their
rooms
and
laurel
stood
before
the
long
glittering
mirror
in
her
gazing
with
sad
eyes
and
trembling
lips
at
the
face
reflected
there
as
at
a
new
creature
a
girl
who
for
three
months
had
been
living
a
strange
unconscious
and
who
had
first
found
out
that
she
had
a
heart
by
its
bitter
aching
why
did
she
love
him
curious
fool
be
still
is
human
love
the
growth
of
human
will
and
struggled
together
in
her
heart
she
felt
with
a
great
throb
of
bitter
shame
that
she
had
given
her
love
unsought
unvalued
and
to
another
woman
lover
maud
merivale
words
rang
in
her
ears
i
shall
win
him
back
and
this
time
no
one
shall
come
between
us
he
belongs
to
maud
merivale
what
matter
he
never
could
have
been
mine
she
said
to
the
girl
gazing
back
at
her
from
the
mirror
with
the
red
roses
dying
on
her
breast
yesterday
she
had
been
reading
in
a
book
in
the
library
some
pretty
verses
written
over
just
such
a
mad
and
foolish
love
as
this
of
hers
a
fancy
seized
her
to
read
them
again
in
the
light
of
this
new
revelation
that
had
flashed
upon
her
heart
i
will
slip
down
to
the
library
and
bring
the
book
she
said
gliding
out
into
the
hall
and
down
the
broad
stairway
shrinkingly
like
a
little
white
ghost
the
library
was
deserted
but
the
shaded
still
burned
over
the
with
its
litter
of
books
and
magazines
the
marble
busts
and
statuettes
against
the
walls
looked
grimly
down
upon
her
this
fair
girl
with
that
look
of
tragic
sorrow
on
her
pale
face
has
been
here
she
murmured
softly
noting
the
faint
fragrance
of
cigar
smoke
that
pervaded
the
air
she
sat
down
in
the
great
cushioned
and
then
she
saw
another
token
of
his
presence
a
knot
of
golden
pansies
he
had
worn
in
his
that
evening
and
which
now
lay
carelessly
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
she
would
never
have
guessed
that
he
had
thrown
them
there
in
passionate
disdain
because
maud
merivale
hand
had
pinned
them
on
his
breast
laurel
picked
up
the
poor
dying
flowers
and
held
them
tenderly
you
have
been
near
the
rose
she
murmured
and
pressed
them
to
her
lips
in
sudden
passionate
love
and
sorrow
she
could
not
help
it
they
spoke
to
her
so
plainly
of
the
proud
man
who
had
won
her
heart
all
unwittingly
they
made
her
think
of
the
princely
form
the
dark
luring
splendid
face
the
proud
cynical
dark
eyes
the
curling
lips
like
that
once
or
twice
only
she
had
seen
curved
into
a
beautiful
smile
subtly
sweet
and
dangerous
which
women
had
worshiped
blindly
but
which
only
shone
upon
them
to
betray
their
hopes
to
ruin
she
held
the
flowers
kissed
them
again
and
again
then
threw
them
far
from
her
in
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
bordering
on
supreme
ah
if
i
could
throw
my
hopeless
passion
from
me
thus
lightly
she
sighed
she
found
the
book
she
wished
and
tempted
by
the
deep
silence
and
quiet
of
the
room
decided
to
remain
awhile
at
least
with
her
fair
head
resting
on
her
arm
she
began
to
read
aloud
softly
after
an
old
habit
of
hers
walk
the
sunny
side
of
fate
the
wise
world
smiles
and
calls
you
great
the
golden
fruitage
of
success
drops
at
your
feet
in
plenteousness
and
you
have
blessings
manifold
renown
and
power
and
friends
and
gold
they
build
a
wall
between
us
twain
that
may
not
be
thrown
down
again
alas
for
i
the
long
time
through
have
loved
you
better
than
you
knew
suddenly
a
sweet
chilly
breath
of
night
air
blew
over
her
she
looked
up
and
saw
leon
le
roy
parting
the
heavy
curtains
of
silk
and
lace
at
the
behind
which
he
had
been
quietly
sitting
smoking
a
cigar
bewildered
startled
laurel
threw
down
her
book
and
sprung
up
in
ignominious
flight
the
master
of
eden
coolly
caught
her
hands
and
forced
her
back
into
her
seat
why
need
you
always
fly
from
me
as
though
i
were
an
ogre
he
said
plaintively
i
shall
not
eat
you
child
tempted
as
i
might
be
to
do
so
i
i
thought
myself
alone
she
stammered
crimsoning
under
his
mocking
raillery
there
is
no
harm
done
he
answered
drawing
up
a
chair
in
front
of
her
and
gazing
at
her
with
the
same
slow
sweet
smile
he
had
worn
when
he
bade
her
return
to
his
mother
and
the
count
that
evening
i
was
smoking
at
the
window
when
you
first
came
in
and
i
thought
at
first
i
would
be
still
and
not
disturb
you
thinking
you
would
go
in
a
moment
but
you
stayed
and
i
changed
my
mind
fancying
some
covert
meaning
in
his
words
she
answered
quickly
but
it
is
late
and
indeed
i
must
be
going
upstairs
now
chapter
xxii
leon
glanced
at
his
watch
no
it
is
not
late
at
least
not
midnight
surely
you
can
spare
me
a
few
minutes
miss
gordon
i
wish
very
much
to
speak
to
you
he
said
almost
gravely
i
can
not
imagine
why
you
should
wish
to
speak
to
me
she
began
tremulously
can
not
you
laughing
well
suppose
i
have
a
mind
to
lecture
you
on
your
frivolity
miss
gordon
do
you
know
i
never
dreamed
what
an
egregious
flirt
you
were
until
i
saw
you
bringing
the
whole
battery
of
your
charms
to
bear
on
that
fascinated
frenchman
this
evening
why
have
you
never
condescended
to
me
likewise
i
deny
the
imputation
i
am
not
a
flirt
she
answered
indignantly
then
you
were
in
earnest
worse
still
he
said
in
that
light
mocking
tone
with
his
piercing
eyes
on
her
burning
face
beatrix
pardon
miss
gordon
what
would
cyril
wentworth
say
to
that
nothing
it
is
no
more
concern
of
his
she
flashed
out
passionately
unconscious
of
the
sudden
joy
that
flashed
into
his
eyes
do
you
mean
that
you
have
broken
with
wentworth
he
exclaimed
yes
she
answered
coldly
he
regarded
her
suspiciously
do
you
know
that
he
is
gone
away
he
asked
doubtfully
to
europe
yes
but
i
do
not
care
she
answered
out
of
the
recklessness
of
her
despair
do
you
mean
that
you
love
him
no
longer
that
it
was
a
mere
that
absence
has
cured
leon
asked
her
anxiously
she
gave
him
a
swift
glance
from
her
dark
eyes
i
do
not
know
why
you
should
presume
to
question
me
so
she
said
with
a
little
flash
of
pride
but
i
will
answer
you
mr
le
roy
yes
it
was
a
mere
childish
fancy
and
i
am
effectually
cured
of
it
i
know
now
that
i
never
loved
cyril
wentworth
in
my
life
he
bowed
his
handsome
head
in
graceful
acknowledgment
your
frankness
emboldens
me
to
ask
another
confidence
he
said
miss
gordon
tell
me
the
story
merivale
poured
into
your
sympathetic
ear
this
evening
she
drew
back
indignant
and
amazed
would
you
ask
me
to
betray
a
woman
sacred
confidence
she
cried
he
laughed
aloud
harshly
sneeringly
do
you
call
confidence
which
is
poured
into
every
ear
that
figment
of
maud
merivale
crafty
brain
he
cried
tell
me
the
pretty
fiction
she
gave
you
miss
gordon
and
then
you
shall
hear
my
side
of
the
story
if
you
wish
me
to
congratulate
you
mr
le
roy
i
will
do
so
now
without
waiting
to
hear
more
she
said
desperately
eager
to
escape
this
painful
interview
he
caught
her
hand
as
she
half
arose
and
gently
forced
her
back
to
her
seat
do
not
leave
me
yet
he
said
pshaw
i
know
her
pitiful
stereotyped
story
we
were
lovers
once
and
her
parents
parted
us
and
sold
her
to
an
old
man
because
he
was
richer
than
i
is
not
that
the
amount
of
the
pretty
idyl
miss
gordon
yes
she
answered
wonderingly
i
thought
so
i
have
heard
it
often
before
now
hear
my
side
of
the
story
child
we
were
lovers
in
our
young
days
that
is
true
you
would
not
believe
that
maud
is
thirty
would
you
miss
gordon
my
mother
thought
me
too
young
to
marry
then
and
besides
she
did
not
wholly
approve
of
my
choice
the
end
justified
her
we
postponed
the
consummation
of
our
bliss
until
i
should
come
of
age
maud
grew
impatient
old
midas
merivale
met
her
and
pardon
the
wretched
slang
miss
gordon
she
for
him
and
threw
me
over
he
resumed
after
a
moment
pause
she
threw
prudence
and
delicacy
to
the
winds
begging
me
to
forgive
her
and
to
take
her
back
to
my
heart
swore
that
she
had
never
ceased
to
love
me
can
you
guess
what
answer
i
made
her
no
she
faltered
thrilling
with
interest
i
told
her
that
since
her
sin
i
had
scorned
all
women
for
her
sake
most
of
all
i
told
her
that
never
until
now
had
i
met
a
woman
who
redeemed
the
sex
in
my
eyes
a
child
woman
so
fair
so
innocent
so
frank
and
truthful
that
falsehood
could
not
breathe
the
same
air
with
her
one
to
whom
i
gave
the
strong
passionate
love
of
a
man
combined
with
the
reverence
due
to
an
angel
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
her
yearningly
his
face
transfigured
with
his
mighty
love
beatrix
i
am
twice
as
old
as
you
are
but
i
love
you
to
madness
i
have
hated
cyril
wentworth
in
my
bitter
jealousy
but
that
is
all
past
thank
god
you
love
him
no
longer
you
are
free
can
you
love

will
you
be
my
wife
laurel

almost
reeled
with
the
suddenness
of
this
perfect
joy
that
had
come
upon
her
she
was
face
to
face
with
the
great
temptation
of
her
life
but
oh
how
powerless
through
her
passionate
love
to
fight
against
it
chapter

deep
emotion
overpowered
laurel
speech
for
a
moment
her
lips
parted
as
if
to
speak
but
closed
again
without
a
sound
her
fair
head
drooped
like
a
beautiful
flower
too
heavily
laden
with
dew
it
had
come
upon
her
like
a
great
shock
that
leon
le
roy
loved
her
loved
her
the
false
beatrix
gordon
the
perjured
girl
living
a
deliberate
lie
beneath
his
roof
she
called
it
by
its
worst
name
to
herself
even
though
she
flinched
from
it
for
she
had
as
clarice
wells
said
of
her
a
habit
of
calling
things
by
their
right
names
to
her
a
spade
was
a
spade
she
had
the
moral
courage
to
recognize
her
sin
but
this
love
had
made
her
a
coward
she
could
not
confess
the
truth
for
the
sake
of
this
man
she
had
risked
all
she
could
not
put
his
love
from
her
now
yet
his
next
words
stabbed
her
with
keenest
pain
for
the
first
time
beatrix
i
feel
like
thanking
god
for
falsity
since
it
has
left
me
free
to
win
you
my
true
girl
true
oh
my
god
she
shuddered
to
herself
and
a
longing
came
over
her
to
be
all
that
he
thought
her
honest
innocent
true
should
she
confess
all
and
trust
to
his
great
love
to
pity
and
pardon
her
she
lifted
her
dark
wistful
eyes
to
his
glowing
eager
face
if
you
had
not
loved
me
perhaps
you
would
have
forgiven
the
wrong
merivale
did
you
she
said
anxiously
the
stern
lines
she
dreaded
came
around
his
lips
again
i
forgave
her
long
ago
as
long
ago
as
my
fancy
for
her
died
he
said
but
i
can
never
respect
her
nor
even
like
her
again
she
deceived
me
i
can
never
forget
that
women
should
be
little
lower
than
the
angels
beatrix
perfect
creature
nobly
planned
to
warn
to
comfort
and
command
and
yet
a
spirit
still
and
bright
with
something
of
an
angel
light
wordsworth
ideal
is
mine
beatrix
i
could
never
again
love
a
woman
who
had
deceived
me
once
fallen
from
her
lofty
pedestal
the
broken
idol
could
never
be
restored
again
he
was
unconsciously
warning
her
but
he
only
frightened
her
she
said
to
herself
that
he
would
never
forgive
her
if
she
told
him
at
this
late
day
how
she
had
deceived
him
and
she
could
not
do
it
she
would
not
risk
it
she
loved
him
too
dearly
she
would
have
his
love
while
she
could
whether
it
lasted
for
a
year
or
a
day
why
did
you
deceive
her
this
evening
she
asked
gaining
courage
as
she
made
her
wild
resolve
you
were
so
devoted
and
attentive
she
thought
she
had
won
you
back
his
scornful
laugh
was
not
good
to
hear
that
was
my
revenge
he
said
i
fooled
her
to
the
top
of
her
bent
while
i
laughed
in
my
sleeve
at
her
credulity
she
should
have
known
me
better
yet
she
came
down
here
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
winning
me
back
she
did
not
find
leon
the
boy
who
was
blinded
by
her
beauty
she
found
le
roy
the
man
who
saw
through
her
shallow
arts
and
despised
her
she
had
no
answer
ready
and
he
went
on
more
slowly
after
a
moment
shall
i
confess
that
i
had
another
motive
too
beatrix
i
longed
to
pique
you
if
possible
since
you
came
to
eden
you
have
been
cold
shy
frightened
of
me
always
i
confess
that
i
gave
you
room
at
first
but
i
soon
became
interested
in
you
and
would
have
repaired
my
error
if
you
had
let
me
but
you
did
not
you
treated
me
with
a
distant
respectful
civility
as
if
i
had
been
as
old
as
my
mother
when
merivale
came
i
determined
to
show
you
that
i
was
not
too
antiquated
to
admire
fair
women
and
to
be
admired
by
them
but
you
held
your
own
so
bravely
you
flirted
so
charmingly
with
count
fitz
john
that
i
was
completely
blinded
and
half
maddened
by
your
indifference
ah
my
darling
he
bent
toward
her
with
a
flash
of
triumphant
love
in
his
splendid
eyes
if
you
had
not
come
in
here
to
night
i
should
never
have
dreamed
never
have
known
you
heard
you
saw
she
broke
in
hot
and
red
with
bitter
shame
oh
i
could
sooner
have
died
hiding
her
burning
face
in
her
small
hands
hush
beatrix
he
drew
the
trembling
hands
away
put
his
arms
around
her
tenderly
and
pillowed
the
flushed
face
on
his
breast
it
was
a
happy
chance
my
love
do
not
regret
it
for
my
sake
do
not
think
i
spied
upon
your
actions
darling
i
did
not
mean
to
disturb
you
only
i
could
not
forbear
peeping
through
the
curtains
and
feasting
my
eyes
on
your
sweetness
so
it
came
to
pass
that
i
heard
and
saw
that
which
made
me
the
happiest
of
men
you
take
it
for
granted
that
i
that
you
she
began
to
remonstrate
incoherently
with
a
mutinous
trembling
pout
upon
her
sweet
red
lips
that
you
belong
to
me
that
i
may
ask
you
for
your
love
since
you
have
broken
with
wentworth
yes
he
answered
full
of
happy
faith
is
it
not
true
beatrix
my
beautiful
love
will
you
not
be
my
cherished
little
wife
and
paler
than
the
marble
statue
that
glimmered
coldly
white
in
the
shadowy
corner
yonder
she
murmured
i
will
full
of
boundless
trust
and
passion
he
bent
down
and
pressed
a
lingering
passionate
kiss
on
the
lips
of
the
beautiful
impostor
god
bless
you
my
little
love
he
said
huskily
and
with
deep
you
shall
never
regret
that
sweet
promise
he
meant
to
keep
his
word
but
we
mortals
are
so
blind
the
day
came
when
she
felt
that
all
her
life
was
one
long
regret
oh
that
word
regret
there
have
been
nights
and
morns
when
we
have
sighed
us
alone
regret
we
are
content
to
throw
thee
all
our
past
so
thou
wilt
sleep
for
aye
but
it
is
patient
and
it
wakes
it
hath
not
learned
to
cry
itself
to
sleep
but
plaineth
on
the
bed
that
it
is
hard
dizzy
with
passionate
love
and
happiness
she
rested
in
his
arms
a
moment
then
drew
herself
shyly
away
it
grows
late
indeed
i
must
leave
you
now
she
whispered
it
is
late
and
you
are
weary
he
said
tenderly
i
must
send
you
to
your
rest
my
precious
one
but
for
me
i
shall
sit
here
all
night
rejoicing
over
my
sweet
new
happiness
they
had
heard
no
step
in
the
hall
but
at
that
moment
the
door
swung
open
and
merivale
appeared
on
the
threshold
in
an
exquisite
her
loosened
golden
hair
flying
over
her
shoulders
she
gazed
in
dismay
for
an
instant
then
started
backward
with
a
quick
smile
of
scorn
pardon
i
could
not
sleep
and
came
for
a
book
i
did
not
dream
of
interrupting
such
an
interesting
midnight
she
said
sneeringly
leon
drew
his
arm
gently
around
the
slight
form
of
his
betrothed
an
ominous
gleam
in
his
eyes
congratulate
us
merivale
he
said
miss
gordon
has
promised
to
be
my
wife
the
snaky
fire
of
hate
flashed
in
greenish
sparkles
from
the
eyes
of
the
disappointed
woman
with
all
my
heart
may
you
be
as
happy
as
you
deserve
she
answered
scornfully
then
turning
to
go
she
bent
swiftly
toward
laurel
vane
and
whispered
in
her
ear
with
the
hissing
tone
of
hate
you
have
triumphed
over
me
you
have
come
between
us
but
do
not
forget
that
breaks
pays
an
omen
laurel
sighed
to
herself
he
was
loath
to
let
her
go
when
the
jealous
angry
woman
had
disappeared
the
pale
frightened
face
touched
his
heart
he
made
her
tell
him
what
maud
merivale
had
hissed
in
her
ear
a
mere
idle
threat
he
said
she
can
do
you
no
harm
beatrix
you
are
too
secure
in
your
high
position
as
gordon
daughter
and
my
promised
wife
for
her
hate
to
touch
you
as
the
mistress
of
eden
you
will
be
socially
her
superior
for
old
midas
merivale
made
his
millions
in
trade
and
the
le
roys
have
inherited
their
wealth
from
several
generations
of
ancestors
indeed
we
trace
our
origin
from
the
french
nobility
everything
he
told
her
only
frightened
her
worse
she
trembled
at
her
presumption
in
entering
this
family
which
prided
itself
less
on
its
great
wealth
than
on
its
noble
pedigree
she
silently
recalled
some
verses
she
had
read
that
evening
i
knew
that
every
victory
but
lifted
you
away
from
me
that
every
step
of
high
emprise
but
left
me
lowlier
in
your
eyes
i
watched
the
distance
as
it
grew
and
loved
you
better
than
you
knew
he
counts
his
ancestors
back
to
the
french
nobility
while
i
do
not
know
what
my
grandfather
name
was
said
louis
vane
daughter
to
herself
before
you
go
my
darling
said
leon
suddenly
there
is
one
thing
i
should
like
to
hear
you
say
tell
me
what
it
is
she
answered
he
took
both
her
trembling
hands
in
his
and
looked
deep
into
her
eyes
with
a
piercing
gaze
that
seemed
to
read
her
soul
lift
up
your
head
beatrix
look
straight
into
my
eyes
and
say
leon
i
love
you
blushing
celestial
rosy
red
she
obeyed
his
fond
command
and
there
was
a
depth
of
pathos
and
passion
in
her
voice
of
which
she
was
herself
unconscious
leon
i
love
you
she
repeated
from
the
depths
of
her
adoring
heart
my
darling
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
strained
her
eagerly
to
his
breast
forgive
me
for
calling
out
your
blushes
so
but
they
are
more
lovely
than
your
roses
now
my
little
love
but
do
not
speak
another
word
let
those
last
sweet
words
live
in
my
memory
he
kissed
her
and
put
her
gently
from
him
then
stood
at
the
door
to
watch
the
little
white
figure
going
lightly
along
the
hall
and
up
the
wide
polished
stairway
mine
mine
my
little
love
he
murmured
gladly
how
pleased
and
happy
my
mother
will
be
he
went
back
into
the
room
threw
himself
down
into
a
chair
and
true
to
his
word
spent
the
remaining
hours
of
the
night
in
a
happy
vigil
dreaming
over
the
sweet
new
happiness
which
had
come
to
him
so
strangely
when
his
heart
had
been
weighed
down
by
despair
and
laurel
vane
she
kept
a
wakeful
vigil
too
her
eyes
were
not
so
bright
as
they
should
have
been
next
morning
her
cheeks
and
lips
were
not
so
rosy
but
her
beauty
was
as
marked
as
ever
and
count
fitz
john
was
very
loath
to
follow
the
angry
disappointed
widow
back
to
new
york
that
day
i
not
only
found
an
eden
but
an
eve
he
said
to
maud
rather
disconsolately
you
need
not
vex
your
heart
over
her
for
she
has
found
her
adam
in
leon
le
roy
she
answered
bitterly
when
they
were
gone
leon
sought
his
mother
congratulate
me
he
said
the
desire
of
your
heart
will
be
granted
i
am
about
to
marry
her
handsome
proud
old
face
did
not
look
as
bright
as
he
had
expected
you
have
chosen
maud
merivale
again
she
said
and
then
he
understood
the
shadow
on
her
face
and
the
tone
of
regret
in
her
voice
you
are
still
prejudiced
against
maud
he
said
quietly
i
have
never
forgiven
her
for
the
slight
she
put
upon
my
son
she
answered
gravely
laurel
slim
young
figure
went
flitting
past
the
open
door
at
that
moment
he
called
to
her
drew
the
small
hand
through
his
arm
and
led
her
up
to
his
mother
mother
here
is
your
daughter
he
said
with
the
brightest
smile
she
had
ever
seen
on
his
darkly
handsome
face
and
cyril
wentworth
she
asked
blissful
but
bewildered
i
have
never
loved
him
it
was
only
fancy
i
have
broken
with
him
forever
answered
the
girl
thank
god
she
cried
drawing
her
new
daughter
into
her
arms
and
kissing
her
fondly
while
she
added
to
leon
gladly
i
am
so
glad
it
is
our
sweet
little
beatrix
and
not
that
odious
maud
merivale
and
that
day
she
wrote
a
letter
to
gordon
telling
her
how
cleverly
their
plot
had
succeeded
and
that
leon
had
taken
cyril
wentworth
place
in
her
daughter
heart
chapter
xxiv
wooed
and
married
and
a
how
swiftly
it
all
had
followed
upon
laurel
vane
coming
to
eden
in
june
she
had
come
to
the
le
roys
a
trembling
frightened
innocent
little
impostor
lending
herself
to
a
fraud
for
beatrix
sake
from
a
most
unwelcome
intruder
whom
they
had
received
with
secret
disfavor
she
had
come
to
be
the
light
of
their
eyes
and
their
hearts
a
fair
ripe
day
in
october
with
the
flying
gold
of
the
ruined
woodlands
driving
through
the
air
she
clung
to
leon
le
roy
arm
his
worshiped
bride
happy
with
a
strange
delirious
happiness
in
spite
of
the
sword
that
ever
hung
suspended
by
a
hair
above
her
head
the
sword
that
must
surely
fall
some
day
and
cause
her
destruction
she
was
dizzy
with
the
whirl
of
events
that
had
brought
about
this
dazzling
consummation
in
the
first
place
mr
le
roy
had
written
to
gordon
announcing
his
engagement
to
his
daughter
and
pleading
for
an
early
marriage
the
publisher
had
replied
on
the
part
of
himself
and
wife
delightedly
sanctioning
their
darling
betrothal
to
mr
le
roy
and
permitting
beatrix
to
consult
her
own
wishes
in
naming
the
day
they
wished
only
to
make
their
darling
happy
they
said
and
she
should
therefore
choose
the
earliest
day
that
pleased
her
gordon
wrote
that
she
would
soon
come
home
to
superintend
the
preparation
of
the
bridal
laurel
was
filled
with
dismay
at
the
latter
information
leon
noting
every
change
of
the
fair
young
face
with
a
lover
eye
was
quick
to
see
the
shadow
what
is
it
my
darling
he
asked
we
must
postpone
the
wedding
a
long
long
time
she
said
mamma
must
not
curtail
her
southern
trip
and
lose
the
benefit
she
is
deriving
from
it
we
must
wait
she
felt
like
a
hypocrite
as
she
said
it
but
she
was
rendered
desperate
by
her
fears
she
knew
that
with
gordon
coming
all
was
at
an
end
and
she
longed
desperately
to
ward
off
the
evil
hour
she
was
so
wildly
deliriously
happy
now
she
would
stave
off
the
hour
of
reckoning
as
long
as
she
could
just
to
remain
at
eden
as
long
as
she
could
was
all
that
she
asked
it
always
seemed
to
her
quite
impossible
that
she
should
ever
become
leon
le
roy
wife
the
blow
would
fall
before
then
she
felt
that
she
was
only
taking
her
pleasure
like
a
butterfly
in
the
sun
and
that
the
nipping
blasts
of
winter
would
soon
lop
off
her
gilded
wings
and
leave
her
crushed
and
trampled
beneath
the
scorner
heel
those
joys
that
we
hold
by
a
frail
slight
tenure
we
always
prize
the
most
this
love
that
she
was
fated
one
day
to
lose
had
become
a
part
of
laurel
vane
life
she
said
to
herself
that
when
she
lost
it
she
would
die
it
was
a
mad
love
that
she
gave
her
noble
princely
looking
lover
she
would
have
made
any
sacrifice
for
him
except
to
tell
him
that
she
had
deceived
him
she
would
have
died
for
him
if
need
be
but
death
would
have
been
easier
than
confessing
her
strange
sin
to
him
leon
chafed
sorely
at
the
idea
of
waiting
so
long
to
claim
his
bonny
bride
they
had
talked
of
a
bridal
tour
to
europe
and
laurel
had
betrayed
the
most
eager
delight
at
the
idea
the
tour
of
europe
had
not
the
attraction
of
novelty
to
him
he
had
made
it
several
times
but
he
longed
to
gratify
the
girl
wish
he
was
so
sure
that
he
would
make
her
happy
he
could
not
bear
to
wait
and
yet
he
was
not
selfish
enough
to
wish
to
hasten
gordon
return
at
the
hazard
of
her
health
his
mother
agreed
with
him
that
it
was
unfortunate
his
having
to
wait
she
was
very
anxious
to
see
him
married
to
beatrix
gordon
and
she
thought
the
autumn
a
pleasant
time
for
crossing
the
ocean
if
they
could
only
be
married
in
october
how
pleasant
it
would
be
but
then
the
it
would
take
an
endless
time
for
that
leon
displayed
all
a
man
impatience
under
the
circumstances
a
fig
for
the
what
could
be
prettier
than
beatrix
white
dresses
that
she
wore
every
day
but
if
she
had
to
have
no
end
of
new
things
why
could
they
get
them
when
they
went
to
paris
worth
was
the
only
man
who
could
make
them
anyhow
given
a
to
cross
the
pond
in
and
she
might
have
a
hundred
new
dresses
if
she
liked
once
they
landed
in
france
must
a
man
wait
months
and
months
for
his
happiness
on
account
of
some
paltry
dresses
mrs
le
roy
in
her
anxiety
for
the
marriage
quite
agreed
with
him
in
his
tersely
expressed
views
if
gordon
came
home
she
would
order
her
daughter
dresses
from
paris
how
much
easier
for
beatrix
to
get
them
herself
while
abroad
she
wrote
to
gordon
and
suggested
the
idea
moreover
she
hinted
broadly
her
fears
that
beatrix
if
let
alone
so
long
might
change
her
mind
might
return
to
the
old
love
no
one
could
say
when
cyril
wentworth
would
return
to
america
nor
what
effect
his
return
might
have
on
his
sweetheart
mrs
le
roy
thought
the
wisest
plan
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
the
case
would
be
for
the
gordons
to
continue
their
southern
tour
and
let
leon
marry
beatrix
quietly
without
any
fuss
or
ceremony
and
take
her
abroad
that
clever
hint
about
cyril
wentworth
had
the
intended
effect
on
the
nervous
invalid
all
her
old
fears
of
cyril
wentworth
were
reawakened
a
longing
desire
took
possession
of
her
to
have
her
daughter
married
off
safely
out
of
the
reach
in
her
sudden
anxiety
she
would
have
had
leon
and
beatrix
married
that
moment
by
telegraph
if
possible
she
infected
her
husband
with
all
her
own
fears
and
both
concurred
in
the
opinion
of
mrs
le
roy
that
delays
were
dangerous
so
a
letter
went
hastily
back
to
eden
full
of
good
tidings
to
the
dwellers
there
the
gordons
approved
and
even
advocated
mrs
le
roy
plan
they
wrote
to
their
daughter
and
recommended
her
to
shorten
the
term
of
her
lover
probation
regretting
that
the
state
of
her
mother
health
made
it
desirable
for
her
to
remain
where
she
was
yet
awhile
longer
the
letter
was
filled
with
such
warm
parental
love
and
advice
that
laurel
involuntarily
wept
over
it
a
generous
check
for
her
parisian
was
inclosed
this
the
young
girl
put
carefully
away
i
shall
never
use
it
she
said
gold
could
not
tempt
me
to
sin
it
is
love
that
has
made
me
bad
and
wicked
but
i
can
not
draw
back
now
i
shall
marry
leon
le
roy
it
is
fate
so
following
that
fate
she
went
recklessly
on
in
her
strange
career
three
weeks
later
she
was
no
longer
laurel
vane
she
was
laurel
le
roy
almost
forgetting
in
her
wild
happiness
her
enemy
threat
breaks
pays
chapter
xxv
days
came
in
which
laurel
almost
forgot
the
long
dark
threatening
shadow
that
lay
always
just
ahead
of
her
they
were
crossing
the
wide
atlantic
ocean
and
every
one
said
that
there
never
had
been
finer
weather
or
a
pleasanter
trip
they
had
no
rough
winds
the
whole
voyage
the
calm
sunny
blue
sky
hung
over
an
ocean
as
beautifully
blue
and
almost
as
calm
the
foamy
white
caps
of
the
waves
were
almost
as
fleecy
and
pure
as
the
snowy
little
clouds
that
sailed
through
the
sky
the
beautiful
were
a
source
of
beauty
and
delight
to
every
one
every
day
was
warm
and
sunny
every
night
was
moonlighted
and
balmy
no
one
had
expected
such
perfect
weather
in
october
forever
after
those
two
weeks
remained
in
laurel
memory
like
a
beautiful
dream
fadeless
and
ineffaceable
for
that
little
time
she
was
perfectly
secure
she
knew
no
one
on
the
steamer
no
one
knew
her
her
husband
was
perfectly
devoted
to
her
as
she
was
to
him
they
spent
long
happy
days
together
on
deck
never
weary
of
each
other
society
they
talked
to
each
other
by
moonlight
their
talk
often
drifting
into
poetry
which
is
the
most
natural
language
of
love
they
made
some
acquaintances
but
they
did
not
seek
other
society
they
were
all
in
all
to
each
other
the
could
not
find
it
in
her
heart
to
repent
of
what
she
had
done
it
appeared
to
her
that
she
had
been
made
for
him
and
he
for
her
judging
by
their
mutual
love
certainly
a
change
for
the
better
had
been
effected
in
leon
le
roy
his
dark
eyes
were
no
longer
cold
and
cynical
but
beamed
with
love
and
happiness
the
mocking
smile
no
longer
curled
his
lips
they
were
sweet
and
gentle
his
voice
rang
with
tenderness
instead
of
sarcasm
his
hatred
and
distrust
for
all
women
because
maud
merivale
had
deceived
him
was
gradually
dying
out
he
believed
that
his
bride
was
an
angel
when
the
awakening
came
it
was
all
the
more
bitter
because
he
had
believed
in
her
so
truly
laurel
was
as
lovely
as
a
dream
in
those
honeymoon
days
her
face
glowed
with
happiness
her
dark
eyes
lost
their
somber
brooding
shadow
and
sparkled
like
stars
the
passengers
said
that
mr
le
roy
young
bride
was
a
perfect
beauty
when
she
walked
on
deck
in
her
soft
fine
white
cashmere
dresses
with
a
crimson
scarf
about
her
shoulders
diamonds
blazing
in
her
small
ears
and
her
splendid
burnished
golden
hair
flying
like
a
banner
of
light
on
the
gentle
breeze
no
one
could
keep
from
looking
at
her
no
one
could
keep
from
envying
leon
le
roy
the
possession
of
so
much
beauty
and
sweetness
and
love
laurel
had
never
known
that
she
was
beautiful
until
leon
told
her
so
it
was
a
new
delight
to
her
some
faint
hope
came
to
her
that
by
that
beauty
she
might
hold
his
heart
even
when
he
found
her
out
even
when
he
knew
her
at
her
worst
an
impostor
who
had
masqueraded
under
a
false
name
and
so
won
him
she
had
read
that
beauty
is
lord
of
love
and
she
prayed
that
it
might
prove
so
to
her
in
her
dark
hour
that
hour
always
just
a
little
ahead
of
her
when
she
should
moan
so
tired
so
tired
my
heart
and
i
though
now
none
takes
me
on
his
arm
to
fold
me
close
and
kiss
me
warm
till
each
quick
breath
end
in
a
sigh
of
happy
languor
now
alone
we
lean
upon
some
graveyard
stone
uncheered
unkissed
my
heart
and
i
she
would
not
think
of
that
nearing
future
much
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
delights
of
the
present
she
was
the
most
fondly
worshiped
wife
in
the
world
when
they
went
to
paris
he
loaded
her
with
costly
gifts
splendid
dresses
priceless
jewels
i
do
not
know
how
i
shall
ever
be
able
to
wear
all
of
these
splendid
things
they
are
too
fine
for
me
she
said
to
him
almost
afraid
of
herself
in
the
midst
of
this
splendid
paraphernalia
nothing
is
too
costly
or
too
fine
for
you
my
little
love
he
answered
taking
her
in
his
arms
and
kissing
the
beautiful
face
over
and
over
you
will
need
all
these
things
when
you
go
into
society
when
we
go
home
we
will
spend
our
winters
in
new
york
and
the
women
in
society
there
dress
like
queens
i
shall
want
you
to
be
the
finest
of
them
all
as
you
are
decidedly
the
most
beautiful
he
wondered
why
the
fair
face
grew
so
pale
why
his
young
wife
shivered
in
his
arms
and
drooped
her
eyes
from
his
i
hope
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
we
return
to
new
york
she
said
almost
petulantly
i
like
europe
better
than
america
you
are
a
most
disloyal
subject
of
the
united
states
he
laughed
but
you
shall
stay
as
long
as
you
wish
my
darling
chapter
xxvi
when
they
went
to
england
laurel
wondered
a
little
tearfully
if
they
should
meet
the
wentworths
she
knew
that
they
were
in
london
and
the
thought
of
coming
upon
them
was
not
pleasant
she
did
not
think
that
beatrix
wentworth
would
approve
of
what
she
had
done
and
she
recalled
clarice
wells
threat
with
an
uncontrollable
shudder
it
had
been
so
vivid
i
would
betray
you
even
in
front
of
the
altar
had
said
the
maid
decidedly
the
thought
of
stumbling
upon
the
wentworths
was
not
pleasant
but
then
said
the
trembling
young
bride
to
herself
there
was
no
likelihood
that
they
would
do
so
london
was
a
great
wide
city
they
might
stay
there
for
years
and
never
stumble
upon
these
people
of
whom
her
guilty
conscience
made
her
feel
so
horribly
afraid
again
she
remembered
that
cyril
wentworth
was
here
on
business
she
and
her
husband
in
quest
of
pleasure
their
ways
lay
far
apart
there
were
no
mutual
aims
and
pursuits
to
bring
them
together
it
was
decidedly
unlikely
that
they
should
meet
but
some
one
has
cleverly
said
that
the
most
unlikely
things
always
happen
they
had
been
in
london
several
weeks
patiently
doing
all
the
wonders
of
that
wonderful
city
when
one
day
mr
le
roy
took
his
wife
to
a
famous
art
gallery
she
had
developed
a
perfect
passion
for
fine
pictures
and
statues
and
he
knew
that
she
would
be
charmed
with
the
works
of
the
old
masters
that
were
gathered
in
this
famous
gallery
the
titians
murillos
guidos
raphaels
all
the
glorious
men
who
by
brush
or
chisel
had
handed
down
their
names
to
an
immortal
fame
it
was
a
bright
day
in
december
the
sun
was
shining
for
a
wonder
in
murky
foggy
london
irradiating
its
usual
atmosphere
leon
was
delighted
that
the
sun
shone
so
brightly
he
knew
that
it
would
show
the
pictures
to
still
greater
advantage
and
he
liked
for
his
darling
to
have
all
her
pleasures
at
their
best
looking
at
laurel
you
would
never
have
guessed
that
until
a
few
months
ago
she
had
lived
in
cheap
lodgings
with
her
erratic
father
and
tended
their
poor
rooms
with
her
own
little
white
hands
she
looked
as
dainty
and
lovely
as
a
little
princess
now
as
she
tripped
along
by
the
side
of
her
handsome
stately
husband
the
day
was
cold
although
the
sun
shone
so
brightly
and
laurel
was
wrapped
in
a
long
cloak
of
shining
with
a
pretty
cap
of
the
same
perched
jauntily
on
her
head
its
long
brown
ostrich
plume
drooping
against
her
long
golden
curls
contrasting
with
their
lovely
tinge
which
must
have
been
a
favorite
shade
with
the
old
masters
for
leon
observed
that
they
had
painted
it
on
the
heads
of
their
most
beautiful
women
there
is
not
a
picture
on
the
walls
half
so
lovely
as
her
living
face
he
said
to
himself
exultantly
looking
at
the
fair
with
its
full
crimson
lips
its
oval
outline
its
wine
dark
eyes
with
such
wealth
of
jetty
lashes
softly
fringing
them
and
the
soft
bright
fringe
of
shading
the
low
white
brow
the
splendid
diamond
solitaires
in
her
rosy
ears
flashed
and
sparkled
with
every
turn
of
the
restless
little
head
and
were
wondrously
becoming
to
her
style
it
was
no
wonder
that
leon
eyes
turned
often
from
the
changeless
canvas
to
dwell
in
fondest
admiration
on
the
living
face
full
of
the
glow
and
flash
and
sparkle
of
youthful
beauty
and
happiness
he
told
her
that
she
was
more
beautiful
than
the
pictured
faces
on
the
walls
and
her
eyes
flashed
with
joy
and
her
face
flushed
rosily
she
was
so
glad
of
the
fairness
god
had
given
her
she
never
wearied
of
hearing
about
it
it
was
the
link
by
which
she
hoped
to
hold
her
husband
when
he
found
out
the
truth
about
her
she
often
asked
herself
anxiously
which
would
be
the
stronger
in
that
terrible
hour
his
love
or
his
pride
but
she
could
never
answer
her
own
question
she
loved
leon
but
she
did
not
yet
understand
him
they
were
standing
in
front
of
a
madonna
when
suddenly
he
touched
her
arm
and
whispered
in
her
ear
some
others
are
waiting
to
look
at
this
dear
let
us
move
on
she
turned
her
beautiful
happy
face
from
the
picture
toward
the
group
who
had
just
come
up
to
them
a
young
lady
and
gentleman
with
a
trim
maid
following
after
some
rich
warm
wraps
over
her
arm
they
were
cyril
wentworth
his
wife
and
her
maid
clarice
the
beautiful
smile
froze
on
laurel
lips
as
she
met
their
startled
wondering
gaze
she
uttered
a
moan
like
one
dying
and
all
in
a
moment
fell
senseless
on
the
floor
chapter

more
than
once
since
they
came
to

clarice
wells
said
anxiously
to
her
mistress
i
am
afraid
miss
vane
has
laid
her
plans
to
marry
mr
le
roy
why
else
should
she
have
wished
to
remain
at
eden
but
beatrix
who
was
very
fond
of
the
lovely
girl
who
had
made
such
a
sacrifice
for
her
sake
would
not
believe
it
she
was
a
dear
good
honest
child
she
said
i
had
hard
work
to
persuade
her
to
personate
me
for
a
little
while
her
exaggerated
notion
of
gratitude
was
all
that
tipped
the
scale
in
my
favor
allowing
a
little
for
her
romantic
pity
for
two
despairing
lovers
i
am
sure
she
would
not
attempt
an
intrigue
at
her
own
risk
one
risks
a
great
deal
for
love
sake
said
clarice
wells
you
would
know
that
by
your
experience
mrs
wentworth
but
laurel
was
not
in
love
with
mr
le
roy
she
was
afraid
of
him
she
wrote
me
to
that
effect
objected
pretty
beatrix
fixing
her
large
blue
eyes
surprisedly
on
clarice
sober
face
i
beg
your
pardon
that
might
have
been
the
case
at
first
but
it
was
not
likely
to
last
said
the
maid
pursuing
her
argument
with
the
freedom
of
a
favorite
i
do
not
believe
miss
vane
antipathy
lasted
long
he
was
very
handsome
and
fascinating
just
the
man
to
win
the
love
of
an
innocent
young
girl
and
he
admired
her
i
am
sure
of
that
wentworth
and
believing
her
to
be
his
equal
in
wealth
and
station
what
was
there
to
prevent
their
marrying
if
they
loved
each
other
you
are
very
clever
clarice
but
i
am
afraid
you
are
making
mountains
of
beatrix
wentworth
answered
lightly
how
could
they
marry
without
papa
and
mamma
consent
beatrix
gordon
would
have
to
return
to
new
york
and
be
married
from
her
father
house
and
how
could
little
laurel
vane
with
her
big
black
eyes
and
innocent
soul
personate
me
to
my
own
parents
do
you
not
see
that
your
theory
would
hold
water
clarice
as
cyril
would
say
in
his
lively
way
clarice
was
silenced
but
not
convinced
anyway
i
wish
i
had
not
left
her
there
she
said
my
conscience
would
be
all
the
clearer
but
wentworth
do
you
think
that
you
should
write
to
your
parents
now
and
confess
what
you
have
done
and
beg
them
to
forgive
you
for
your
naughty
conspiracy
and
runaway
marriage
two
crystal
drops
brimmed
over
in
wentworth
blue
eyes
and
splashed
down
upon
her
pink
cheeks
dear
papa
dear
mamma
it
was
naughty
and
wicked
to
desert
them
so
she
said
but
they
were
too
hard
upon
cyril
and
me
i
loved
him
so
dearly
i
could
not
bear
it
but
i
loved
them
too
and
although
cyril
makes
me
so
happy
my
heart
aches
for
the
dear
ones
at
home
and
you
will
write
to
them
the
plunge
has
to
be
made
some
time
as
well
now
as
ever
urged
the
maid
no
not
now
what
do
you
take
me
for
clarice
do
you
think
i
would
betray
sweet
little
laurel
to
whom
i
owe
all
my
happiness
cried
beatrix
indignantly
i
beg
your
pardon
for
naming
it
of
course
you
know
best
wentworth
replied
discreet
clarice
dropping
the
subject
they
had
discussed
the
matter
several
times
each
retaining
her
own
opinion
of
the
matter
on
the
principle
that
a
woman
convinced
against
her
will
is
of
the
same
opinion
still
beatrix
like
most
adoring
young
wives
who
confide
all
they
know
to
their
husbands
laid
her
grievance
before
cyril
the
handsome
happy
young
benedick
humbly
begged
his
wife
pardon
for
coinciding
with
clarice
views
rather
than
hers
but
he
could
not
be
shaken
from
his
first
opinion
that
the
romance
of
the
conspiracy
would
culminate
in
the
marriage
of
leon
le
roy
and
laurel
vane
it
would
be
a
delightful
ending
he
said
laughing
at
her
horrified
face
but
i
tell
you
it
would
not
she
said
emphatically
it
would
be
just
too
dreadful
for
anything
and
i
will
not
believe
it
of
sweet
little
laurel
vane
i
hope
she
may
justify
your
good
opinion
my
dear
said
cyril
wentworth
dryly
but
kissing
her
fondly
and
loving
her
all
the
more
for
her
boundless
faith
in
her
fellow
woman
but
they
dropped
the
subject
then
and
if
any
one
speculated
further
on
laurel
vane
hopes
and
plans
it
passed
in
silence
beatrix
was
too
generous
to
believe
evil
of
the
innocent
girl
who
had
served
her
in
her
clever
counterplot
against
her
parents
she
loved
laurel
for
all
she
had
done
for
her
when
the
shock
of
the
truth
came
upon
her
it
was
all
the
harder
to
bear
because
of
the
loving
faith
she
had
persistently
cherished
that
bright
december
day
cyril
went
home
to
their
neat
pretty
lodgings
and
announced
that
he
had
a
holiday
it
is
such
a
lovely
day
i
should
like
to
take
you
out
somewhere
darling
he
said
smoothing
the
bright
waves
of
her
golden
hair
with
caressing
fingers
you
know
it
is
not
often
that
i
have
the
chance
to
escort
you
anywhere
in
the
day
they
discussed
duly
the
important
subject
of
where
to
go
and
decided
on
an
art
gallery
both
adored
pictures
clarice
dressed
her
mistress
in
her
silks
and
furs
and
decided
to
follow
the
party
with
extra
wraps
for
her
mistress
in
case
the
day
should
prove
colder
than
they
thought
and
in
order
to
gratify
her
own
penchant
for
no
thought
came
to
them
of
the
great
surprise
that
awaited
them
in
the
famous
art
gallery
they
went
forward
to
meet
it
all
unconsciously
even
as
laurel
awaited
their
coming
among
the
pictures
and
statues
all
unconscious
of
what
was
hastening
to
her
they
were
unusually
gay
beatrix
had
been
pining
a
little
of
late
under
the
depressing
influence
of
the
rainy
dismal
weather
the
bright
sunshine
revived
her
spirits
and
brought
the
warm
pink
roses
to
her
cheeks
she
laughed
and
chatted
gayly
to
her
delighted
husband
they
loitered
in
the
gallery
and
admired
the
beautiful
paintings
and
statues
all
the
work
of
master
hands
long
since
dissolved
to
dust
they
saw
only
two
persons
besides
themselves
a
lady
and
gentleman
with
their
faces
turned
toward
the
beautiful
painting
of
a
madonna
the
lady
had
golden
hair
that
was
strangely
familiar
to
beatrix
and
clarice
but
then
many
of
the
englishwomen
had
golden
hair
each
said
to
herself
that
it
was
only
fancy
that
it
reminded
them
of
laurel
vane
so
they
went
on
slowly
and
unconsciously
and
the
handsome
man
and
beautiful
girl
turned
around
and
faced
them
they
saw
the
young
face
whiten
with
fear
heard
the
frightened
moan
break
from
the
trembling
lips
saw
her
reel
dizzily
and
fall
like
a
stone
at
their
feet
and
they
knew
that
this
was
laurel
vane
that
leon
le
roy
was
her
husband
and
that
her
wretched
falsehood
had
found
her
out
chapter
xxviii
mr
le
roy
turning
in
the
same
moment
with
his
wife
saw
two
faces
that
he
recognized
cyril
wentworth
that
he
had
seen
once
in
new
york
and
clarice
which
he
remembered
perfectly
well
beatrix
he
did
not
know
he
glanced
at
her
carelessly
little
thinking
what
an
influence
the
pretty
blonde
had
exerted
over
his
life
a
pang
of
jealousy
keen
swift
and
terrible
as
the
lightning
flash
tore
through
his
heart
as
he
beheld
his
worshiped
bride
waver
and
fall
like
one
dead
to
the
floor
he
believed
that
the
mere
sight
of
cyril
wentworth
face
had
produced
that
terrible
emotion
that
had
stricken
her
down
like
a
broken
flower
at
their
feet
for
an
instant
he
stood
motionless
almost
petrified
by
his
agitation
then
he
bent
down
over
the
beautiful
face
that
only
a
moment
ago
had
been
lifted
to
his
sparkling
and
glowing
with
love
and
happiness
it
was
pale
and
rigid
now
and
the
jetty
fringe
of
the
lashes
lay
heavily
on
the
white
cheeks
as
if
they
would
never
lift
again
from
the
sweet
dark
eyes
quick
as
he
was
clarice
was
before
him
she
was
kneeling
down
loosening
the
furs
and
laces
about
the
throat
of
the
unconscious
girl
with
deft
easy
fingers
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
strange
glance
it
is
only
a
faint
she
said
but
she
may
be
some
time
in
recovering
you
had
better
go
out
and
bring

he
obeyed
her
like
one
in
a
dream
and
the
moment
he
was
gone
clarice
borrowed
wentworth
i
only
sent
him
out
on
a
pretext
she
said
we
must
get
her
revived
before
he
returns
wentworth
will
you
please
remove
her
gloves
and
chafe
her
hands
no
perhaps
your
wife
might
do
it
better
she
added
with
a
quick
afterthought
beatrix
had
been
clinging
to
her
husband
arm
staring
like
one
dazed
at
the
strange
scene
she
knelt
down
and
drew
off
laurel
dark
kid
gloves
and
chafed
the
delicate
dimpled
white
hands
she
saw
a
broad
gold
on
the
slender
finger
of
one
small
hand
guarded
by
a
keeper
of
magnificent
diamonds
and
rubies
all
three
looked
significantly
at
one
another
and
clarice
said
to
her
mistress
wentworth
i
told
you
so
cyril
could
not
repress
a
slight
laugh
as
he
stood
gazing
down
upon
them
his
keen
perception
told
him
the
truth
it
is
laurel
vane
he
said
and
beatrix
answered
yes
in
a
dazed
tone
while
the
maid
supplemented
quickly
or
rather
laurel
le
roy
at
that
moment
laurel
shivered
and
opened
her
eyes
she
saw
herself
supported
in
clarice
arms
while
beatrix
kneeling
by
her
chafed
her
small
hands
they
saw
her
glance
wander
past
them
yearningly
and
a
moan
of
pitiful
despair
came
from
her
white
lips
as
she
missed
the
face
she
sought
you
fainted
and
mr
le
roy
has
gone
out
for
some
de
said
the
maid
a
touch
of
color
came
into
the
blanched
face
she
turned
her
dark
frightened
eyes
up
to
their
cold
faces
you
have
betrayed
me
she
said
in
a
faint
almost
dying
tone
beatrix
seemed
incapable
of
speech
clarice
answered
coldly
we
have
said
nothing
yet
then
she
continued
gravely
miss
vane
are
you
mr
le
roy
wife
yes
i
am
his
wife
laurel
answered
faintly
and
she
tore
her
hands
from
beatrix
and
covered
her
face
with
them
no
one
spoke
for
a
moment
then
clarice
asked
slowly
did
you
deceive
him
to
the
end
to
the
bitter
end
shuddered
laurel
in
a
hollow
tone
then
suddenly
she
let
the
shielding
hands
fall
from
her
burning
face
and
looked
at
beatrix
do
not
look
at
me
so
sternly
and
coldly
wentworth
she
cried
you
sent
me
there
are
you
not
to
blame
no
one
could
have
believed
that
wentworth
gentle
face
could
grow
so
hard
and
cold
laurel
vane
had
so
bitterly
betrayed
the
trust
she
reposed
in
her
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
forgive
her
do
not
charge
me
with
your
folly
your
madness
she
cried
indignantly
my
sin
was
bad
enough
but
yours
is
beyond
pardon
how
dared
you
marry
the
proud
rich
leon
le
roy
i
loved
him
he
loved
me
moaned
the
wretched
young
bride
and
what
will
become
of
his
love
now
when
he
learns
the
truth
queried
beatrix
with
stinging
scorn
cyril
hastily
interposed
do
not
be
hard
on
her
beatrix
she
was
kind
to
us
be
kind
to
her
see
she
is
almost
by
your
scorn
laurel
looked
at
the
handsome
kindly
face
it
was
full
of
sympathy
and
pity
not
hard
and
angry
like
the
women
faces
her
despairing
heart
filled
with
new
hope
she
clasped
her
hands
and
looked
at
him
with
dark
appealing
eyes
yes
i
pitied
you
i
helped
you
to
your
love
she
said
pleadingly
will
you
let
them
rob
me
of
mine
will
you
let
them
betray
me
all
the
pity
in
his
heart
all
his
manly
compassion
was
stirred
into
life
by
her
words
and
looks
we
love
each
other
she
went
on
pathetically
we
love
each
other
even
as
you
and
your
wife
love
do
not
come
between
us
yet
let
us
be
happy
a
little
longer
beatrix
you

said
cyril
bending
down
to
take
his
wife
hand
in
his
own
they
love
even
as
we
love
dear
can
you
bear
to
part
them
to
betray
her
she
is
little
more
than
a
child
you
will
break
her
heart
the
beginning
of
it
all
lies
with
us
do
we
not
owe
her
our
pity
at
least
our
pity
and
our
silence
your
silence
that
is
all

ask
cried
the
culprit
eagerly
the
end
will
come
soon
enough

me
have
a
little
respite

me
where
to
find

mr
le
roy

an
engagement

and
i
will
come
to
you

will
tell
you
how
it
all
happened
i
will
beg
for
your
pity
on
my
bended
knees
she
began
to
weep
passionately
beatrix
could
not
bear
those
bitter
tears
she
drew
out
her
hastily
here
is
my
address
she
said
come
to
me
and
tell
me
the
whole
story
i
can
judge
better
then
what
is
best
for
me
to
do
she
did
not
pity
laurel
much
she
felt
angry
with
her
for
her
presumption
in
marrying
one
so
far
above
her
as
mr
le
roy
and
then
the
folly
the
madness
of
it
she
could
not
understand
the
mad
love
that
had
driven
laurel
step
by
step
into
her
terrible
position
mr
le
roy
is
coming
do
not
let
him
suspect
anything
wrong
said
cyril
hastily
he
turned
with
a
smile
to
meet
the
handsome
stately
gentleman
mr
le
roy
i
am
cyril
wentworth
he
said
genially
permit
me
to
assure
you
that
your
wife
is
quite
recovered
and
to
present
you
to
my
wife
mrs
wentworth
chapter
xxix
married
said
leon
to
himself
with
a
start
and
a
quick
glance
at
beatrix
he
bowed
to
her
gracefully
then
hurried
to
his
wife
side
you
are
better
beatrix
he
said
anxiously
and
they
all
saw
his
passionate
heart
looking
out
of
the
beautiful
eyes
he
bent
on
her
pale
and
face
she
clung
to
him
in
a
sort
of
nervous
terror
and
fear
yes
i
am
better
thanks
to
the
goodness
of
clarice
and
her
mistress
she
faltered
you
must
thank
them
for
their
kindness
to
me
leon
and
take
me
away
he
obeyed
her
request
in
a
few
courteous
words
bowed
to
the
party
and
led
his
wife
away
outwardly
cool
and
collected
but
on
fire
with
jealous
pain
she
loves
him
still
she
fainted
at
the
bare
sight
of
him
he
muttered
to
himself
my
god
why
did
she
marry
me
then
was
it
for
wealth
and
position
the
bitter
doubt
tore
his
heart
like
a
knife
an
unconscious
coldness
grew
up
in
his
heart
toward
her
he
placed
her
silently
in
the
carriage
and
springing
in
beside
her
gave
himself
up
to
bitter
reflections
the
carriage
whirled
them
away
to
their
hotel
and
as
it
rattled
over
the
streets
laurel
watched
her
husband
cold
grave
face
with
wonder
what
is
it
st
leon
she
asked
him
slipping
her
arm
timidly
in
his
why
do
you
look
so
grave
i
am
puzzled
he
answered
over
what
st
leon
asked
the
beautiful
girl
over
your
fainting
spell
he
answered
moodily
you
told
me
you
had
ceased
to
love
cyril
wentworth
but
at
the
bare
sight
of
him
you
fell
like
one
dead
what
am
i
to
think
beatrix
it
came
over
her
like
a
flash
that
he
was
jealous
of
cyril
wentworth
of
cyril
wentworth
whom
she
had
never
beheld
until
how
she
longed
for
him
to
know
the
truth
to
tell
him
that
she
had
never
loved
mortal
man
save
him
whom
she
called
her
husband
but
it
was
one
of
the
pains
and
penalties
of
her
position
that
she
could
not
confess
to
leon
he
must
go
on
believing
that
her
first
pure
love
had
been
lavished
on
another
must
go
on
doubting
her
for
his
looks
and
words
assured
her
that
the
first
seeds
of
jealousy
had
been
sown
in
his
heart
hot
tears
of
pain
and
humiliation
gathered
in
her
eyes
and
splashed
heavily
down
her
pale
cheeks
oh
leon
you
do
not
you
can
not
believe
that
i
love
him
still
she
sighed
why
then
your
agitation
at
that
chance
meeting
he
inquired
i
was
startled
only
that
she
answered
it
was
like
seeing
a
ghost
and
you
must
remember
there
was
clarice
too
i
assure
you
i
was
more
startled
at
the
sight
of
her
than
by
wentworth
it
was
a
nervousness
agitation
fright
what
you
will
leon
but
not
love
no
no
no
not
love
i
love
you
only
my
husband
you
are
the
life
of
my
life
she
clasped
her
hands
around
his
arm
and
looked
up
to
him
with
dark
pathetic
eyes
i
am
not
perfect
leon
she
said
and
life
is
not
all
sunshine
some
day
the
heavy
lowering
clouds
of
fate
will
pour
out
their
blinding
rain
upon
our
heads
you
may
believe
many
hard
things
of
me
then
leon
but
you
may
be
sure
of
one
thing
always
dear
i
love
you
now
and
i
shall
love
you
forever
with
the
maddest
deepest
passion
a
woman
heart
can
cherish
he
had
never
heard
her
speak
with
such
passion
before
her
love
had
been
like
a
timid
bird
brooding
softly
in
her
heart
too
shy
to
soar
into
the
sunlight
but
the
words
burst
from
her
now
eloquent
with
her
heart
emotion
and
made
sacred
by
the
burning
drops
that
fell
from
her
eyes
he
could
not
but
believe
her
the
jealous
misery
fled
from
his
heart
as
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
the
trembling
rosebud
mouth
forgive
me
darling
for
doubting
you
he
said
repentantly
it
was
because
i
love
you
so
dearly
and
i
have
always
been
so
absurdly
jealous
of
cyril
wentworth
i
would
give
anything
upon
earth
to
be
able
to
say
that
you
had
never
loved
any
one
but
me
and
she
could
not
tell
him
that
it
was
true
it
was
a
part
of
her
punishment
that
this
dark
shadow
the
thought
that
her
first
love
had
been
given
another
should
never
be
lifted
from
his
life
she
knew
that
it
was
a
pain
to
his
jealous
nature
but
her
lips
were
sealed
some
day
he
would
know
the
truth
she
said
to
herself
bitterly
but
then
it
would
come
too
late
for
his
happiness
chapter
xxx
i
loved
him
wentworth
that
is
all
my
defense
call
me
weak
cowardly
wicked
if
you
will
but
i
could
not
put
the
temptation
from
me
think
what
all
my
life
had
been
how
dull
how
sad
how
lonely
was
it
easy
to
put
away
happiness
when
it
came
to
me
in
so
fair
a
guise
the
white
hands
were
clasped
imploringly
the
dark
eyes
were
lifted
pleadingly
as
the
sad
words
fell
from
laurel
lips
beatrix
wentworth
and
clarice
wells
her
judges
and
accusers
looked
gravely
upon
the
tortured
face
of
the
culprit
the
fairest
culprit
that
was
ever
arraigned
for
her
sin
do
you
call
it
happiness
said
beatrix
wentworth
i
should
not
think
you
would
know
one
happy
hour
living
on
the
verge
of
a
volcano
that
may
destroy
you
at
any
moment
i
should
think
that
your
sorrow
and
repentance
would
almost
kill
you
but
i
do
not
repent
cried
laurel
desperately
i
shall
never
repent
while
i
remain
with
leon
i
am
too
happy
in
spite
of
my
fears
for
sorrow
or
repentance
when
i
am
torn
away
from
him
when
i
have
lost
his
love
then
i
shall
repent
then
i
shall
understand
the
depths
of
my
dreadful
sin
but
never
before
they
looked
at
her
in
wonder
they
could
not
understand
her
surely
she
was
mad
the
glamour
of
passion
had
obscured
her
reason
and
when
the
end
comes
when
he
has
put
you
from
him
what
will
you
do
then
poor
child
asked
beatrix
slowly
then
i
shall
die
the
beautiful
girl
answered
despairingly
and
again
they
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
her
she
had
no
thoughts
outside
of
this
love
that
she
held
by
so
slight
a
thread
she
could
see
nothing
beyond
it
but
death
beatrix
could
not
help
feeling
vexed
with
her
she
loved
her
own
young
husband
with
a
fond
romantic
love
but
she
could
not
comprehend
the
madness
of
laurel
devotion
it
is
not
so
easy
to
die
laurel
she
said
impatiently
you
are
a
woman
now
and
you
must
not
answer
me
like
a
child
your
sin
will
find
you
out
some
day
and
you
will
perhaps
be
cast
adrift
on
the
world
you
should
have
some
plans
formed
for
that
time
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
laurel
murmured
tremblingly
leon
loves
me
perhaps
he
will
forgive
me
clarice
wells
gave
an
audible
sigh
from
her
corner
beatrix
murmured
poor
child
and
the
mistress
and
maid
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
a
moment
they
did
not
know
how
to
deal
with
this
nature
both
wondered
in
themselves
if
leon
le
roy
would
indeed
forgive
her
falsehood
they
did
not
think
so
beatrix
toyed
nervously
with
the
tassels
of
her
morning
dress
laurel
she
said
after
a
moment
clarice
and
i
have
formed
a
plan
for
you
we
do
not
want
to
betray
you
to
your
husband
we
think
it
would
be
better
it
you
confessed
the
truth
to
him
yourself
they
never
forgot
how
deathly
white
she
grew
nor
how
wild
and
frightened
the
dark
eyes
looked
she
threw
out
her
hands
as
if
to
ward
off
a
blow
confess
to
leon
why
i
would
sooner
die
she
gasped
but
my
dear
child
remonstrated
beatrix
he
would
be
far
more
likely
to
forgive
you
if
you
confessed
to
him
yourself
than
if
i
betrayed
you
you
will
not
do
that
oh
you
will
not
do
that
you
could
not
be
so
cruel
gasped
laurel
throwing
herself
impulsively
at
beatrix
feet
oh
wentworth
i
helped
to
happiness
do
not
rob
me
of
mine
clarice
raised
her
gently
and
replaced
her
in
her
seat
you
have
not
heard
all
my
plan
out
laurel
said
beatrix
i
do
not
forget
my
debt
to
you
i
would
sooner
help
you
than
betray
you
i
was
going
on
to
say
that
if
you
would
be
brave
enough
to
confess
to
leon
how
you
have
wronged
him
i
too
would
confess
to
him
i
would
tell
him
how
much
i
was
to
blame
i
would
beg
him
to
forgive
you
because
you
were
so
innocent
and
ignorant
and
because
you
loved
him
so
then
if
it
came
to
the
worst
if
in
his
pride
and
his
wrath
he
should
put
you
away
from
him
you
might
come
to
us
to
cyril
and
me
the
hapless
young
creature
did
not
answer
a
word
she
stared
at
beatrix
mutely
with
wide
wild
eyes
like
a
hunted
fawn
well
what
do
you
say
laurel
inquired
beatrix
will
you
do
as
i
wish
you
it
is
too
terrible
a
risk
i
do
not
dare
moaned
laurel
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
then
for
a
time
there
was
silence
beatrix
was
hurt
and
chagrined
that
her
plan
had
been
discarded
she
thought
laurel
was
a
headstrong
willful
child
rushing
blindly
upon
her
own
destruction
but
she
could
not
help
pitying
the
girl
her
fear
and
misery
were
so
great
she
desisted
from
advising
her
it
seemed
too
much
like
torturing
some
lovely
helpless
creature
the
hunted
look
in
the
dark
eyes
pained
her
after
all
is
she
any
worse
than
i
am
said
beatrix
to
herself
i
deceived
my
parents
i
risked
everything
for
love
sake
and
this
poor
child
has
done
no
more
than
that
i
must
not
be
angry
with
her
i
must
remember
always
that
it
was
i
who
led
her
into
temptation
she
went
to
her
gently
she
took
the
white
hands
from
the
pale
face
and
held
them
kindly
in
both
of
hers
laurel
do
not
look
so
miserable
and
she
said
gently
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
me
laurel
looked
at
her
with
a
flash
of
hope
in
her
humid
eyes
do
you
mean
that
you
will
not
betray
me
she
panted
i
will
not
betray
you
beatrix
answered
i
pity
you
too
much
my
poor
child
and
i
know
that
the
end
will
come
soon
enough
far
be
it
from
me
to
hasten
the
evil
hour
she
was
glad
she
had
spoken
so
kindly
when
she
saw
the
lovely
flush
of
joy
that
came
into
the
sensitive
face
laurel
thanked
and
blessed
her
passionately
then
the
dark
eyes
turned
to
clarice
and
will
you
have
mercy
on
me
too
she
said
i
have
always
been
afraid
of
you
clarice
i
have
always
remembered
what
you
said
the
words
have
haunted
me
i
meant
what
i
said
replied
the
maid
if
i
had
seen
you
going
to
the
altar
with
him
i
should
have
betrayed
you
and
saved
him
it
would
have
been
my
duty
and
now
laurel
questioned
faintly
it
has
gone
too
far
answered
clarice
you
are
mr
le
roy
wedded
wife
what
god
hath
joined
together
no
man
must
put
asunder
she
thanked
them
with
such
trembling
passion
and
joy
that
they
could
have
wept
i
do
not
know
whether
i
am
doing
right
said
beatrix
but
i
am
very
happy
and
i
remember
always
that
you
helped
me
to
my
happiness
and
that
i
thoughtlessly
led
you
into
temptation
i
will
keep
your
secret
laurel
and
may
god
help
you
when
your
hour
of
reckoning
comes
as
it
too
surely
will
my
poor
child
sooner
or
later
chapter
xxxi
laurel
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
back
to
her
hotel
before
mr
le
roy
returned
from
his
engagement
with
the
friend
whom
he
had
unexpectedly
encountered
in
london
she
removed
her
street
dress
immediately
and
he
never
suspected
the
momentous
visit
she
had
made
that
morning
to
cyril
wentworth
wife
she
was
gay
and
loving
as
usual
and
he
dreamed
not
what
bitter
tears
had
dimmed
her
eyes
that
morning
in
her
fear
that
he
would
find
her
out
in
her
sin
but
that
night
she
said
to
him
with
pretty
impatience
when
are
we
going
to
leave
london
leon
i
am
very
tired
of
the
rain
and
the
cold
i
thought
you
had
not
done
yet
he
said
a
little
surprised
at
her
capriciousness
there
are
many
places
of
interest
which
you
have
not
visited
yet
i
am
tired
of
it
all
she
declared
one
wearies
of
the
rain
and
the
smoke
and
the
fog
i
should
like
to
go
to
italy
where
the
sun
shines
all
day
and
the
air
is
balmy
and
warm
will
you
take
me
st
leon
we
will
go
if
you
wish
he
replied
there
is
nothing
to
detain
us
in
london
it
shall
be
cried
laurel
he
humored
her
caprice
and
took
her
to
italy
she
did
not
breathe
freely
until
she
was
out
of
london
she
was
horribly
afraid
of
meeting
the
wentworths
again
they
hired
a
charming
little
villa
in
southern
italy
and
lived
there
several
months
leading
a
beautiful
idyllic
life
that
charmed
laurel
she
called
the
pretty
place
eden
in
loving
memory
of
her
home
letters
came
often
from
mrs
le
roy
occasionally
from
the
gordons
gordon
was
not
fond
of
and
though
she
loved
her
daughter
dearly
she
wrote
to
her
but
seldom
these
letters
laurel
always
posted
to
beatrix
wentworth
in
london
with
her
own
hands
she
felt
sure
that
beatrix
would
understand
and
be
glad
to
receive
them
by
dint
of
earnest
application
she
had
acquired
a
very
fair
imitation
of
wentworth
writing
but
her
conscience
always
reproached
her
when
she
answered
those
fond
parental
letters
she
always
felt
the
burden
of
her
guilt
most
deeply
then
so
her
letters
were
brief
and
infrequent
but
the
gordons
thought
nothing
of
it
beatrix
had
never
been
a
diffuse
writer
and
they
supposed
she
was
all
absorbed
in
her
happiness
now
laurel
never
expressed
the
least
desire
to
return
to
america
mr
le
roy
was
rather
amused
at
her
persistent
preference
for
the
old
world
one
thing
pleased
mr
le
roy
very
much
while
they
remained
in
italy
his
wife
developed
a
sudden
taste
for
music
she
regretted
that
she
had
never
learned
the
piano
masters
were
procured
for
her
at
her
own
desire
and
for
one
who
had
professed
not
to
care
for
music
her
progress
was
exceedingly
rapid
when
summer
came
they
wearied
of
italy
and
went
to
switzerland
ah
those
happy
days
abroad
that
long
sweet
honeymoon
it
was
so
heavenly
sweet
it
was
no
wonder
that
laurel
could
not
repent
of
the
fraud
by
which
she
had
won
her
splendid
husband
life
was
a
dream
of
elysium
love
took
up
the
glass
of
time
and
turned
it
in
his
glowing
hands
every
moment
lightly
shaken
ran
itself
in
golden
sands
she
was
beginning
to
feel
almost
secure
in
her
happiness
when
one
evening
the
shadow
fell
as
it
always
falls
unexpectedly
on
her
life
she
had
come
down
dressed
for
an
opera
to
which
her
husband
had
promised
to
take
her
and
she
was
looking
her
loveliest
her
robe
of
white
silk
and
pink
brocade
was
exquisitely
becoming
and
she
wore
great
flashing
diamonds
on
her
round
white
throat
and
arms
she
had
never
looked
lovelier
but
leon
did
not
notice
her
radiant
beauty
there
was
a
shadow
on
his
dark
handsome
face
he
came
and
put
his
arms
around
the
beautiful
figure
crushing
it
against
his
breast
reckless
how
he
rumpled
her
dainty
laces
beatrix
my
darling
i
have
bad
news
he
said
hoarsely
she
started
and
uttered
a
cry
her
lips
grew
livid
she
seemed
to
shrink
in
the
fond
arms
that
held
her
do
not
be
frightened
my
love
he
said
we
will
hope
for
the
best
what
is
it
she
gasped
through
her
dry
parched
lips
i
have
received
a
cablegram
from
america
my
mother
is
very
we
must
return
home
immediately
he
said
in
a
voice
shaken
by
anxiety
and
emotion
chapter
xxxii
he
had
expected
that
beatrix
would
be
startled
and
distressed
but
he
was
not
prepared
for
the
burst
of
emotion
with
which
she
received
his
news
home
home
she
burst
out
in
a
voice
that
was
like
a
wail
of
despair
then
suddenly
flinging
her
arms
about
his
neck
she
broke
into
tempestuous
sobbing
as
if
the
very
depths
of
her
heart
were
stirred
by
throes
of
keenest
anguish
he
was
touched
and
startled
by
this
display
of
affectionate
grief
for
his
mother
never
had
he
clasped
her
so
fondly
never
kissed
her
so
tenderly
as
now
when
he
believed
that
her
heart
ached
and
her
tears
flowed
for
the
sake
of
the
mother
whom
he
loved
beatrix
my
own
sweet
love
do
not
grieve
so
wildly
he
said
caressingly
she
is
ill
but
it
may
not
be
fatal
i
broke
the
news
to
you
too
suddenly
i
did
not
realize
until
this
moment
what
a
tender
loving
heart
you
have
cheer
up
darling
it
may
not
be
as
bad
as
we
fear
we
will
pray
for
her
recovery
she
threw
back
her
head
and
looked
in
his
face
with
wild
dark
eyes
all
swimming
in
tears
oh
leon
what
did
the
cablegram
say
she
aspirated
eagerly
that
she
is
very
ill
dear
but
that
did
not
necessarily
imply
a
fatal
sickness
he
answered
soothingly
she
caught
at
the
words
with
the
eagerness
of
desperation
oh
leon
why
need
we
go
home
at
all
then
beatrix
he
did
not
know
himself
how
coldly
he
put
her
from
him
how
sharp
and
rebuking
his
tone
sounded
he
was
hurt
and
amazed
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
not
have
understood
her
aright
he
looked
at
the
beautiful
form
drooping
before
him
humbly
and
he
saw
that
he
had
frightened
her
by
his
sudden
harshness
her
lips
were
trembling
with
fear
beatrix
he
said
perhaps
i
have
not
understood
you
aright
did
you
really
express
a
desire
not
to
go
home
she
looked
at
the
dark
handsome
face
with
the
touch
of
sternness
upon
it
and
her
heart
sunk
within
her
i
thought
i
thought
she
faltered
that
if
mrs
le
roy
were
not
so
very
ill
we
need
not
perhaps
go
home
just
yet
oh
forgive
me
leon
i
did
not
mean
to
be
selfish
i
love
the
old
world
so
well
i
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
going
back
to
america
for
the
first
time
since
their
happy
he
looked
coldly
and
sternly
at
his
fair
young
bride
she
had
almost
forgotten
how
those
proud
lips
could
curl
how
that
mobile
face
could
express
the
lightning
passions
of
his
soul
she
saw
now
what
a
dreadful
mistake
she
had
made
oh
beatrix
how
i
have
deceived
myself
he
cried
do
you
know
what
i
thought
just
now
when
you
burst
into
tears
i
believed
that
all
your
grief
was
for
my
mother
because
you
loved
her
and
were
sorry
for
her
i
never
loved
you
so
well
as
when
i
thought
that
you
shared
so
wholly
in
my
affection
for
my
parent
and
yet
in
the
next
breath
you
show
me
my
mistake
your
pleasure
your
comfort
ranks
higher
in
your
thoughts
than
my
mother
welfare
oh
child
are
you
indeed
so
selfish
the
sadness
and
reproach
in
his
voice
tore
her
guilty
heart
like
a
knife
she
flew
to
his
arms
she
would
not
be
held
at
a
distance
i
am
a
wretch
she
cried
remorsefully
forgive
me
leon
i
love
mrs
le
roy
i
grieve
over
her
illness
it
was
only
my
abominable
selfishness
and
thoughtlessness
that
made
me
so
heartless
i
have
grown
selfish
forgetting
every
one
else
and
finding
all
my
happiness
in
you
forget
it
if
you
can
at
least
forgive
it
i
am
ready
to
go
home
with
you
immediately
nay
i
am
most
anxious
to
go
but
her
voice
faltered
and
she
shed
such
hot
tears
upon
his
breast
that
they
seemed
to
blister
her
cheeks
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
declaring
her
own
he
could
do
no
less
than
forgive
her
indeed
her
sorrow
and
repentance
were
so
great
that
he
felt
that
he
had
been
too
harsh
and
stern
with
her
he
remembered
that
she
was
only
a
child
and
she
had
been
so
pleased
with
her
travels
it
was
no
wonder
that
she
had
been
disappointed
when
the
end
came
upon
her
so
suddenly
besides
i
could
not
in
reason
expect
her
to
be
as
fond
of
my
mother
as
i
am
he
said
to
himself
apologetically
and
to
ease
the
smart
of
his
disappointment
he
kissed
the
fair
young
face
until
her
tears
were
dried
and
told
her
that
she
was
forgiven
for
her
momentary
selfishness
and
that
next
year
they
would
come
abroad
again
we
must
be
upon
the
sea
i
am
very
anxious
to
reach
home
he
said
little
guessing
that
his
words
pierced
her
heart
like
the
point
of
a
deadly
poisoned
dagger
chapter
xxxiii
all
of
the
young
bride
happiness
began
to
wane
from
that
hour
the
shadow
of
the
nearing
future
began
to
fall
upon
her
heart
the
coming
events
cast
their
shadows
before
a
subtle
change
came
over
her
her
cheek
was
a
shade
less
bright
her
voice
had
an
unconscious
tone
of
pathos
the
dark
eyes
drooped
beneath
their
shady
lashes
sometimes
she
fell
into
deep
reveries
that
lasted
for
hours
the
return
voyage
was
not
so
pleasant
by
any
means
as
the
other
had
been
laurel
was
going
away
from
her
peril
then
she
was
returning
to
it
now
leon
gave
all
his
thoughts
and
all
his
love
to
his
fair
bride
now
he
divided
them
with
her
and
his
mother
he
was
very
fond
of
his
handsome
stately
lady
mother
and
deeply
distressed
over
her
illness
he
longed
to
fly
to
her
on
the
wings
of
love
he
chafed
over
their
slow
progress
bitterly
impatient
of
the
adverse
winds
and
waves
that
hindered
the
gallant
ship
from
making
progress
if
he
had
known
how
his
wife
welcomed
every
storm
he
would
have
been
horrified
if
some
hidden
rock
had
sunk
the
steamer
and
she
and
leon
had
gone
to
the
bottom
clasped
in
one
another
arms
and
silent
in
a
last
embrace
she
would
have
been
glad
she
would
have
thought
that
that
was
happiness
compared
with
what
lay
before
her
leon
did
not
notice
the
slight
yet
subtle
change
in
his
darling
so
absorbed
was
he
in
anxiety
over
his
mother
perhaps
he
thought
she
shared
in
his
trouble
he
knew
that
her
devotion
to
him
was
more
manifest
than
ever
before
and
he
repaid
it
with
the
love
of
his
inmost
heart
but
he
was
very
grave
and
thoughtful
the
dread
that
he
might
find
his
mother
dead
weighed
heavily
on
his
spirits
poor
laurel
in
her
terror
for
herself
did
not
give
many
thoughts
to
mrs
le
roy
the
lesser
evil
was
swallowed
up
in
the
greater
the
gordons
had
returned
to
new
york
in
the
spring
once
she
returned
home
a
meeting
with
them
was
inevitable
and
then
what
detection
exposure
banishment
despair
through
all
her
dread
and
terror
one
spark
of
hope
burned
feebly
in
her
heart
she
knew
that
her
husband
loved
her
with
a
deep
and
mighty
love
perhaps
through
that
love
he
would
forgive
her
i
could
forgive
anything
she
said
to
herself
with
the
divine
love
of
woman
surely
surely
he
will
forgive
me
it
was
may
when
they
reached
new
york
laurel
had
had
eight
months
of
happiness
now
almost
perfect
happiness
she
was
little
more
than
a
child
still
she
was
only
seventeen
but
she
had
gained
great
benefit
from
her
happy
bridal
trip
her
beauty
was
deepened
and
intensified
she
had
acquired
polish
and
dignity
and
there
was
a
sweet
and
gracious
womanliness
about
her
that
was
exquisitely
charming
leon
said
to
himself
exultantly
that
he
should
be
very
proud
to
introduce
his
bonny
bride
to
new
york
society
next
winter
she
would
be
without
a
peer
for
loveliness
i
am
so
impatient
to
go
home
to
my
sick
mother
at
eden
that
i
am
almost
selfish
enough
to
ask
you
to
pass
through
new
york
without
stopping
to
see
your
parents
he
said
when
they
landed
she
hastily
assured
him
that
she
had
no
intention
of
stopping
her
anxiety
to
reach
eden
was
as
great
as
his
own
there
would
be
time
enough
to
see
her
parents
when
they
were
assured
of
mrs
le
roy
well
being
he
did
not
notice
how
deathly
pale
she
was
but
thanking
her
gratefully
for
what
appeared
to
him
a
sweet
accepted
it
and
she
said
to
herself
with
a
beating
heart
i
have
still
a
little
respite
i
shall
see
eden
once
more
before
i
am
banished
forever
the
home
on
the
hudson
looked
indeed
that
bright
warm
day
when
they
walked
arm
in
arm
up
to
the
house
the
trees
and
shrubberies
were
tinted
with
the
tender
green
of
spring
a
soft
warm
air
redolent
with
flowers
fanned
their
faces
leon
looked
pleased
at
being
home
again
but
it
struck
him
all
at
once
that
his
wife
looked
pale
and
wan
and
miserable
it
is
plain
to
be
seen
beatrix
that
you
have
no
joy
in
your
he
said
unable
to
conceal
his
disappointment
and
yet
i
thought
indeed
you
used
to
say
that
you
adored
eden
indeed
i
do
i
love
every
tree
and
flower
every
tiniest
blade
of
grass
on
the
place
i
am
very
happy
in
my
she
cried
eagerly
but
she
had
a
guilty
miserable
inward
consciousness
that
he
did
not
believe
her
her
changeful
tell
tale
face
had
betrayed
her
all
too
plainly
they
went
into
the
house
and
then
she
forgot
for
awhile
all
her
own
selfish
terrors
as
leon
forgot
his
disappointment
over
his
reluctance
to
come
home
for
the
shadow
of
the
wing
hung
darkly
over
eden
mrs
le
roy
was
yet
very
ill
with
a
low
typhoid
fever
and
pneumonia
surrounded
by
skillful
nurses
and
the
ablest
physicians
there
were
yet
grave
doubts
whether
she
would
ever
recover
the
disease
was
deeply
seated
and
the
physicians
could
not
conceal
from
the
stricken
son
their
fears
of
a
fatal
result
she
had
been
dangerously
ill
three
weeks
now
wavering
as
it
were
between
life
and
death
they
would
do
all
they
could
the
physicians
said
but
the
issue
lay
with
god
in
that
dark
hour
laurel
was
her
husband
comforter
she
put
self
aside
she
forgot
that
a
shadow
deeper
than
death
brooded
darkly
over
her
own
young
life
she
whispered
peace
and
hope
to
the
troubled
heart
i
will
pray
for
her
she
said
and
i
will
nurse
her
perhaps
love
can
save
her
even
where
paid
attention
fails
then
too
she
will
be
so
glad
to
have
her
children
home
again
happiness
may
have
a
good
effect
upon
her
do
not
despair
leon
i
have
the
greatest
faith
that
she
will
be
spared
to
us
his
heavy
heart
unconsciously
grew
lighter
at
the
sweet
hopeful
words
and
one
thing
she
said
came
true
at
least
though
they
were
almost
afraid
to
break
the
news
to
mrs
le
roy
of
her
son
arrival
and
set
about
it
in
the
most
cautious
manner
it
undoubtedly
produced
a
beneficial
effect
on
her
she
seemed
to
grow
better
from
that
hour
and
her
joy
at
seeing
laurel
was
as
great
as
that
she
evinced
in
the
return
of
leon
laurel
as
she
had
declared
she
would
became
the
most
devoted
and
patient
nurse
at
mrs
le
roy
bedside
her
love
and
her
eagerness
to
be
of
use
served
her
instead
of
experience
there
was
no
step
so
light
no
touch
so
cool
and
soft
as
hers
no
face
so
eagerly
welcomed
by
the
bedside
of
the
sufferer
beatrix
is
my
ministering
angel
she
confided
to
her
son
and
laurel
hearing
it
was
thrilled
with
inward
joy
i
have
won
a
place
in
her
heart
when
my
dark
hour
comes
she
will
take
my
part
she
will
plead
for
me

gordon
reclining
at
ease
on
a
satin
divan
in
her
elegant
parlor
was
entertaining
a
caller
no
less
a
person
than
the
beautiful
widow
merivale
the
wife
of
the
wealthy
publisher
was
a
pale
faded
pretty
woman
once
a
belle
and
beauty
now
a
chronic
invalid
she
mingled
but
little
in
society
on
account
of
her
delicate
health
but
chance
had
made
her
acquainted
with
maud
merivale
and
the
fair
widow
for
some
reason
of
her
own
had
followed
up
the
acquaintance
gordon
was
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
with
this
new
friend
she
loved
beauty
and
merivale
was
decidedly
good
to
look
upon
all
the
adventitious
aid
of
art
had
been
called
in
to
preserve
her
fading
charms
and
in
the
richest
and
most
becoming
of
spring
toilets
she
looked
very
fair
and
sweet
and
youthful
in
the
aristocratic
of
the
curtained
parlor
they
had
been
discussing
a
subject
dear
to
gordon
matronly
heart
but
full
of
secret
gall
and
bitterness
to
the
widow
the
marriage
of
beatrix
gordon
to
leon
le
roy
inwardly
fuming
with
jealous
rage
merivale
held
her
passions
in
with
a
strong
rein
and
smiled
her
sweetest
as
she
dilated
on
her
last
summer
visit
to
eden
where
she
had
met
beatrix
and
enthusiastically
fallen
in
love
with
her
on
the
spot
so
beautiful
so
graceful
said
merivale
arching
her
penciled
brows
she
will
make
so
charming
a
mistress
for
eden
and
they
are
home
from
europe
you
tell
me
two
weeks
ago
answered
gordon
you
have
seen
them
of
course
how
happy
the
meeting
must
have
been
between
the
mother
and
daughter
sentimentally
no
i
have
not
seen
my
darling
yet
sighed
gordon
they
were
suddenly
summoned
home
by
the
illness
of
mrs
le
roy
and
did
not
have
time
to
communicate
with
me
gordon
has
promised
to
take
me
down
to
eden
in
a
few
days
though
i
am
so
impatient
to
see
beatrix
i
can
scarcely
wait
no
doubt
smiled
the
visitor
sympathetically
she
had
followed
gordon
eyes
to
a
portrait
of
a
pretty
girl
that
hung
against
the
wall
she
had
seen
the
lady
glance
wander
in
the
same
direction
several
times
her
curiosity
was
aroused
and
looking
critically
at
the
really
beautiful
portrait
she
detected
a
strong
resemblance
between
the
fair
fresh
girlish
face
and
the
pretty
faded
matronly
woman
your
own
portrait
is
it
not
she
asked
with
a
smile
gordon
looked
pleased
and
flattered
is
it
really
so
much
like
me
she
asked
your
image
i
should
have
recognized
it
anywhere
pronounced
the
widow
following
up
the
good
impression
she
had
made
well
my
daughter
was
always
said
to
resemble
me
but
really
now
merivale
you
must
have
recognized
beatrix
you
flatter
me
too
much
simpered
gordon
merivale
false
smiles
and
grimaces
gave
way
for
once
to
an
expression
of
honest
surprise
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
it
is
your
portrait
taken
when
you
were
perhaps
a
little
younger
she
asked
no
it
is
not
mine
do
you
not
recognize
my
daughter
merivale
it
is
beatrix
herself
beatrix
merivale
gazed
bewildered
at
the
fair
young
pictured
face
the
soft
blue
eyes
smiled
into
hers
the
hair
waved
softly
over
the
low
white
brow
the
face
had
a
fair
refined
loveliness
all
its
own
but
it
was
not
the
face
she
recalled
as
that
of
beatrix
gordon
there
flashed
before
her
mind
eye
a
face
bright
and
soft
like
a
tropic
flower
lighted
by
dark
starlike
eyes
crowned
by
grand
tresses
of
dusky
burnished
gold
a
face
before
whose
rare
and
witching
beauty
this
other
one
paled
like
a
flower
before
a
star
she
looked
at
gordon
surprise
and
bewilderment
on
her
face
her
eyes
open
to
their
widest
are
you
jesting
she
said
or
have
you
another
daughter
you
do
not
really
wish
me
to
believe
that
this
is
beatrix
why
not
gordon
asked
a
little
gravely
it
is
not
the
least
bit
like
her
declared
merivale
who
had
left
her
seat
and
rustled
over
to
the
portrait
it
is
utterly
unlike
her
the
eyes
are
blue
here
the
hair
pale
gold
yet
your
daughter
whom
i
saw
at
eden
had
dark
eyes
and
hair
of
the
darkest
golden
shade
gordon
laughed
lightly
you
have
surely
forgotten
how
beatrix
looked
she
said
that
canvas
represents
her
truly
and
perfectly
the
best
judges
have
agreed
that
the
portrait
is
marvelously
true
to
nature
my
dear
merivale
you
are
thinking
of
some
one
else
i
have
no
other
child
than
beatrix
and
there
are
no
dark
eyes
in
our
family
merivale
remained
silent
for
a
moment
her
face
had
a
dazed
expression
i
am
mistaken
she
said
to
herself
is
it
likely
i
should
forget
how
the
girl
looked
who
stole
leon
from
me
she
had
great
black
eyes
full
of
fire
and
soul
she
was
rarely
beautiful
this
portrait
looks
a
mere
doll
beside
her
and
yet
gordon
swears
that
this
is
beatrix
gordon
if
it
is
true
as
she
says
then
there
is
some
mystery
about
it
what
does
it
mean
she
went
back
to
her
seat
again
and
replied
to
gordon
with
a
light
laugh
yes
i
see
now
that
i
was
mistaken
i
was
thinking
of
some
one
else
one
meets
so
many
fair
faces
in
society
but
to
herself
she
was
saying
if
there
is
a
mystery
i
will
find
it
out
nothing
will
please
me
so
well
as
to
injure
the
girl
who
married
leon
le
roy
but
though
her
suspicions
were
aroused
they
were
vague
and
unformed
she
did
not
dream
of
the
real
truth
before
leaving
she
said
with
her
most
innocent
and
engaging
air
i
have
a
great
mind
to
run
down
to
eden
with
you
when
you
go
it
is
only
recently
that
i
received
a
letter
from
mrs
le
roy
inviting
me
to
visit
her
we
are
quite
old
friends
you
know
shall
you
object
to
have
me
make
one
of
your
party
gordon
thought
it
would
be
rather
pleasant
than
otherwise
to
have
the
pretty
vivacious
widow
accompany
them
to
eden
she
expressed
her
opinion
very
graciously
and
merivale
was
delighted
a
thousand
thanks
she
twittered
i
shall
enjoy
the
trip
with
you
and
gordon
so
much
and
i
do
so
want
to
see
dear
mrs
le
roy
and
our
sweet
bride
and
her
husband
who
by
the
bye
was
once
my
but
that
was
long
ago
i
threw
him
over
for
merivale
who
had
the
most
money
although
unfortunately
he
sunk
a
great
deal
in
a
foolish
speculation
after
i
married
him
ah
well
leon
will
bear
me
no
ill
will
now
when
he
has
secured
such
a
bonny
bride
she
lingered
until
they
had
named
the
day
for
the
trip
then
departed
full
of
vague
plans
against
the
happiness
of
leon
bride
chapter
xxxv
ross
powell
had
been
bitterly
chagrined
and
disappointed
at
his
failure
to
trace
laurel
vane
after
his
meeting
with
her
at
the
gates
of
eden
her
beauty
had
inspired
him
with
a
passion
that
all
her
anger
and
scorn
and
detestation
were
powerless
to
chill
while
he
tried
to
hate
her
for
her
disdain
he
could
not
help
loving
her
for
the
rare
loveliness
that
had
won
him
at
first
sight
brooding
deeply
over
the
subject
after
his
return
to
new
york
he
made
up
his
mind
that
if
he
could
not
possess
laurel
in
any
other
way
he
would
make
her
his
wife
he
did
not
doubt
but
that
she
would
be
delighted
at
the
chance
of
becoming
powell
and
after
coming
to
this
magnanimous
resolve
he
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
find
her
out
and
propose
to
her
but
fate
was
against
him
his
clerkly
duties
kept
him
chained
to
his
desk
so
closely
that
it
was
only
at
the
christmas
holidays
he
found
an
opportunity
of
returning
to
the
vicinity
of
eden
to
prosecute
his
search
after
long
cogitation
on
the
subject
he
had
concluded
that
laurel
had
misled
him
in
stating
that
she
was
not
staying
at
eden
he
now
believed
that
she
belonged
to
the
staff
of
domestics
at
eden
and
that
she
had
hidden
her
identity
under
an
assumed
name
the
little
jade
tricked
me
cleverly
that
time
but
i
catch
up
with
her
yet
he
muttered
angrily
to
himself
for
he
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
having
been
duped
by
a
simple
girl
like
laurel
so
with
his
faculties
sharpened
by
reflection
and
spurred
on
by
his
passion
which
only
gained
in
strength
by
the
months
of
suspense
he
had
endured
ross
powell
returned
to
the
palace
on
the
hudson
where
he
hoped
to
find
laurel
employed
in
some
menial
capacity
by
the
proud
rich
le
roys
alas
for
laurel
if
she
had
remained
at
eden
for
the
villain
would
most
undoubtedly
have
detected
her
this
time
but
as
the
reader
knows
she
was
absent
in
europe
with
her
husband
powell
in
a
sly
underhand
way
informed
himself
thoroughly
regarding
the
household
at
eden
and
became
satisfied
that
the
object
of
his
search
was
not
there
he
was
bitterly
enraged
at
his
in
the
pursuit
of
the
beautiful
and
as
he
imagined
unprotected
orphan
i
was
a
fool
to
let
her
slip
through
my
fingers
so
easily
that
day
he
told
himself
i
wish
i
had
followed
her
and
let
business
go
to
the
mischief
until
i
had
settled
my
own
a
little
delay
would
not
have
mattered
to
him
while
my
own
cause
was
ruined
by
my
attention
to
business
never
mind
once
i
get
on
her
track
again
she
shall
not
escape
me
twice
she
has
given
me
the
slip
let
her
look
to
the
third
time
alas
poor
laurel
in
her
summer
home
across
the
sea
she
had
forgotten
this
crafty
spider
that
lay
in
wait
for
her
whose
love
was
crueler
than
hate
he
returned
to
the
city
sullen
angry
disappointed
but
more
anxious
than
ever
to
find
her
a
new
idea
had
taken
possession
of
his
mind
it
occurred
to
him
that
laurel
had
perhaps
gone
abroad
in
the
capacity
of
maid
to
the
young
bride
mrs
le
roy
this
idea
having
once
taken
possession
of
his
mind
was
dwelt
on
until
it
became
a
rooted
belief
he
was
quite
certain
that
he
had
solved
the
mystery
of
her
absence
now
he
cursed
her
for
a
clever
little
wretch
who
could
never
have
eluded
him
so
cleverly
if
she
had
not
inherited
her
father
brains
and
he
was
a
genius
he
said
egad
it
seems
a
little
strange
that
old
vane
pretty
looking
girl
should
descend
to
the
level
of
a
common
servant
he
was
proud
although
he
ruined
himself
by
drink
i
wonder
if
his
bones
do
turn
in
the
coffin
at
thought
of
little
laurel
waiting
on
beatrix
gordon
he
made
arrangements
to
be
informed
at
the
earliest
hour
of
the
return
of
mr
le
roy
and
his
bride
to
eden
he
swore
that
laurel
should
not
forestall
him
and
get
away
this
time
if
she
only
knew
that
i
meant
to
do
the
fair
thing
by
her
and
make
her
powell
i
have
no
doubt
she
would
be
deuced
glad
to
have
me
find
her
he
thought
egotistically
it
a
bother
that
i
ca
have
her
without
but
she
a
little
filly
and
has
her
own
notions
perhaps
i
can
arrange
for
a
mock
marriage
then
when
i
am
tired
of
her
i
can
drop
her
more
easily
she
will
drown
herself
of
course
when
she
finds
out
that
she
has
been
deceived
so
ran
the
musings
of
the
wretch
and
his
impatience
reached
as
the
dreary
winter
months
dragged
away
and
still
mr
le
roy
lingered
abroad
with
his
lovely
bride
little
dreaming
in
their
happiness
of
the
clerk
sitting
behind
the
desk
in
gordon
office
and
growing
ever
more
and
more
impatient
for
their
return
winter
passed
away
at
length
followed
by
march
with
its
chilling
boisterous
winds
its
clouded
murky
skies
april
came
with
its
sunshine
and
rain
may
with
its
balmy
airs
and
fragrant
flowers
still
they
came
not
how
he
hated
those
grand
rich
people
who
could
loiter
their
time
away
amid
the
beauties
and
luxuries
of
the
old
world
and
keep
laurel
away
from
him
losing
her
heart
perhaps
to
some
musical
italian
frenchman
or
sturdy
englishman
a
vague
bitter
jealousy
of
he
knew
not
what
filled
his
heart
he
never
forgot
how
glad
he
felt
when
in
the
latter
part
of
may
he
heard
that
mr
le
roy
and
his
bride
had
returned
to
eden
a
burning
impatience
filled
him
to
get
away
from
the
office
and
go
down
to
eden
to
assure
himself
if
laurel
were
really
there
he
made
some
excuse
of
indisposition
or
private
business
in
fact
the
first
ready
lie
that
came
to
his
tongue
and
asked
gordon
for
a
holiday
it
was
granted
and
on
the
same
day
ross
powell
went
down
to
eden
so
confident
of
success
that
the
disappointment
he
experienced
staggered
him
with
its
bitterness
and
intensity
for
when
he
went
boldly
to
the
servants
entrance
and
asked
for
young
mrs
le
roy
maid
a
pert
foreigner
a
mademoiselle
whom
leon
had
engaged
in
paris
to
attend
his
wife
came
to
him
her
broken
english
her
voluble
french
her
cap
and
ribbon
alike
disgusted
him
he
crushed
a
bitter
oath
between
his
teeth
and
went
away
it
is
just
as
i
feared
and
dreaded
he
thought
some
jackanapes
over
the
sea
has
won
her
and
she
would
not
return
with
the
le
roys
who
had
to
engage
that
painted
beribboned
chattering
monkey
in
her
place
i
have
a
great
mind
to
go
and
ask
gordon
daughter
to
tell
me
about
laurel
vane
but
on
second
thoughts
he
concluded
not
to
do
so
it
would
come
to
gordon
ears
and
might
possibly
set
unpleasant
inquiries
on
foot
after
all
it
could
not
avail
him
anything
to
know
how
he
had
lost
her
fate
had
played
him
a
trick
a
dastardly
trick
that
nothing
could
undo
now
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
resign
the
hopes
that
had
buoyed
him
up
for
many
months
realize
that
the
game
he
had
played
was
over
and
that
he
had
been
the
loser
his
love
turned
to
hate
his
passion
to
a
dastardly
yearning
for
revenge
upon
the
beautiful
girl
the
little
jade
how
cleverly
she
gave
me
the
slip
i
would
give
anything
on
earth
to
be
able
to
punish
her
he
muttered
wickedly
to
himself
he
was
walking
slowly
along
the
dusty
road
that
wound
along
the
banks
of
the
river
and
had
already
left
the
beautiful
extensive
grounds
of
eden
some
distance
behind
him
the
sun
was
setting
resplendently
gilding
the
beautiful
river
with
gold
and
a
soft
breeze
fanned
his
hot
brow
but
the
beauties
of
nature
had
no
charm
for
his
soul
he
walked
on
with
lowering
moody
brows
and
did
not
look
up
until
a
cloud
of
dust
blowing
over
him
and
the
sound
of
approaching
carriage
wheels
forced
an
impatient
imprecation
to
his
lips
then
he
looked
up
and
the
sight
he
beheld
was
photographed
on
his
memory
forever
an
exquisite
little
phaeton
the
daintiest
the
most
he
had
ever
beheld
in
his
life
was
approaching
him
drawn
by
two
superb
white
horses
whose
smooth
satiny
coats
harness
and
azure
glittered
in
the
golden
sunlight
among
the
cushions
sat
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
the
latter
a
dark
handsome
man
whom
he
recognized
instantly
as
leon
le
roy
beside
him
sat
a
young
beauty
in
the
daintiest
parisian
bonnet
and
toilet
smiles
on
her
lips
love
in
her
eyes
peerless
loveliness
on
the
face
lifted
so
tenderly
to
leon
ross
powell
gave
one
quick
look
into
that
beautiful
face
and
gasped
like
one
dying
laurel
vane
leon
saw
the
man
trudging
in
the
dust
and
touched
his
hat
courteously
laurel
saw
him
and
her
young
face
whitened
to
the
hue
of
death
ross
powell
did
not
return
the
gentleman
bow
did
not
move
nor
speak
he
only
stood
still
in
the
road
like
one
dazed
while
the
dazzling
equipage
whirled
past
him
and
covered
him
with
dust
the
echoing
sound
of
the
wheels
that
seemed
to
roll
over
his
heart
died
away
the
slowly
lowered
and
sunk
to
its
kindred
earth
again
during
those
moments
he
had
stood
like
one
dead
staring
blindly
before
him
he
roused
himself
now
shook
himself
like
one
awakened
from
a
painful
dream
and
turning
gazed
down
the
road
he
was
too
late
the
dainty
equipage
with
its
daintier
mistress
and
handsome
master
had
gone
out
of
sight
like
a
dream
he
was
alone
in
the
golden
glow
of
the
beautiful
sunset
the
soft
sound
of
the
river
in
his
ears
his
heart
on
fire
with
the
memory
of
that
lovely
face
that
had
flashed
on
him
suddenly
like
a
star
out
of
blackest
night
laurel
vane
and
by
leon
le
roy
side
what
does
it
mean
he
asked
himself
he
went
over
in
his
mind
every
detail
of
the
beautiful
happy
face
the
rich
dress
the
shining
jewels
she
wore
only
the
richest
ladies
in
new
york
wore
such
things
as
these
he
knew
why
did
laurel
vane
have
them
how
came
she
to
be
sitting
by
leon
le
roy
side
one
of
the
proudest
richest
men
in
the
state
he
sat
down
on
the
grassy
river
bank
and
tried
to
collect
his
thoughts
he
was
all
at
sea
he
could
not
understand
chapter
xxxvi
there
was
no
longer
any
fear
that
mrs
le
roy
would
die
she
was
better
she
was
rapidly
convalescing
leon
was
very
happy
over
her
recovery
he
had
not
known
how
well
he
loved
his
mother
until
the
dread
of
her
loss
hung
over
him
he
had
been
sad
and
gloomy
over
the
prospect
of
losing
her
he
was
and
jubilant
now
over
her
convalescence
not
the
least
of
his
happiness
was
that
his
mother
with
all
the
fancifulness
of
an
invalid
ascribed
her
recovery
to
her
devoted
care
and
nursing
she
would
not
give
any
credit
to
the
physicians
who
had
exhausted
the
skill
of
the
esculapian
art
for
her
benefit
she
declared
that
the
paid
nurses
were
a
set
of
careless
neglectful
dolts
she
was
quite
sure
that
she
must
have
perished
among
them
but
for
the
love
and
care
of
her
son
wife
leon
and
his
wife
both
knew
that
the
invalid
was
unjust
to
her
faithful
attendants
and
that
really
they
had
done
all
they
could
to
hasten
her
recovery
but
they
could
not
help
being
pleased
and
happy
over
her
affectionate
fiction
and
indeed
laurel
had
devoted
herself
with
unsparing
love
and
patience
to
leon
mother
when
care
and
skill
had
failed
she
had
gone
on
her
knees
in
prayer
though
it
often
crossed
her
mind
that
perhaps
god
would
not
hear
the
pleadings
of
one
who
was
herself
living
a
dreadful
lie
of
which
she
could
not
repent
because
she
was
so
blissfully
happy
that
she
could
not
realize
the
enormity
of
her
sin
but
all
doubt
was
over
now
the
gloomy
shadow
of
the
wing
no
longer
hung
over
eden
the
physicians
declared
that
mrs
le
roy
would
live
and
mrs
le
roy
declared
that
her
had
saved
her
life
no
one
gainsaid
her
for
they
saw
that
the
fancy
made
her
happier
and
leon
if
possible
loved
his
wife
more
passionately
than
before
for
her
devotion
to
his
mother
when
the
long
strain
of
fear
and
anxiety
was
over
they
began
to
see
that
the
faithful
nurse
had
suffered
somewhat
in
her
tireless
vigils
by
the
couch
of
pain
she
was
thinner
and
paler
her
eyes
looked
wide
and
dark
and
somber
just
as
they
did
when
almost
a
year
ago
now
she
had
first
come
to
eden
when
leon
terrible
anxiety
over
his
mother
was
dispelled
he
began
to
be
alarmed
over
his
wife
it
struck
him
that
she
was
not
looking
well
and
scarcely
happy
my
darling
you
have
worn
yourself
out
in
tender
cares
for
my
mother
he
said
i
have
been
selfish
to
allow
it
but
i
did
not
think
you
should
have
been
more
careful
over
yourself
but
she
is
better
now
and
you
must
relegate
the
cares
of
the
to
others
while
you
go
out
with
me
and
brighten
your
faded
roses
a
strange
mournful
smile
quivered
over
the
beautiful
face
i
must
not
leave
her
yet
she
said
she
would
miss
me
so
much
she
loves
me
he
could
not
understand
the
wistful
pathos
that
trembled
in
the
tone
he
believed
that
her
wearisome
confinement
to
the
had
saddened
her
spirits
she
loves
you
he
cried
catching
her
in
his
arms
and
kissing
the
pale
face
until
it
glowed
with
tender
blushes
who
does
not
love
you
my
own
my
peerless
beatrix
you
are
the
queen
of
love
and
beauty
i
worship
you
as
the
lovely
incarnation
of
all
that
is
best
and
purest
in
your
sex
and
deeply
as
i
loved
you
before
i
shall
always
love
you
better
for
your
devotion
to
my
mother
always
she
murmured
and
again
it
seemed
to
him
there
was
a
ring
of
pathos
that
was
almost
pleading
in
the
low
sweet
voice
it
confirmed
him
in
his
belief
that
she
was
saddened
and
overwrought
by
her
wearisome
confinement
in
the
always
my
darling
can
you
doubt
it
he
said
looking
fondly
into
the
wistful
dark
eyes
as
he
held
her
in
his
arms
i
will
not
doubt
it
i
will
be
happy
as
long
as
i
can
she
answered
with
a
sort
of
desperation
that
day
when
they
sat
by
mrs
le
roy
couch
together
she
began
herself
to
realize
the
change
that
had
come
over
her
son
wife
she
missed
the
roses
from
the
delicate
cheeks
the
brightness
from
the
eyes
but
most
of
all
the
happy
smile
from
the
red
lips
it
even
seemed
to
her
that
they
had
a
wistful
pathetic
droop
i
have
been
selfish
over
my
daughter
she
said
repentantly
she
has
broken
herself
down
waiting
on
me
beatrix
my
darling
can
you
forgive
me
for
being
such
a
selfish
thoughtless
old
woman
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
she
answered
i
have
not
felt
any
weariness
and
i
have
been
only
too
happy
to
be
with
you
and
to
care
for
you
you
are
a
dear
unselfish
child
cried
mrs
le
roy
but
i
intend
to
be
so
unreasonable
again
you
must
leave
me
with
the
nurses
now
that
i
am
better
and
go
out
with
your
husband
riding
and
driving
again
i
want
to
see
the
roses
back
in
your
face
and
the
light
in
your
eyes
and
leon
you
must
write
to
the
gordons
and
ask
them
to
come
and
make
us
a
visit
oh
for
heaven
sake
do
not
ask
them
laurel
cried
out
with
such
sudden
energy
and
passion
that
they
were
startled
her
face
was
deathly
white
with
the
shock
she
had
received
they
looked
at
her
in
surprise
my
dear
i
do
not
think
you
understood
my
mother
said
her
husband
she
wishes
to
invite
your
parents
to
visit
you
should
you
not
be
pleased
to
have
them
come
she
saw
that
in
her
terror
she
had
almost
betrayed
her
horrible
fear
of
the
gordons
i
understood
she
faltered
i
only
meant
meant
that
it
would
be
better
not
to
ask
them
just
yet
until
your
mother
is
better
until
she
is
able
to
go
out
some
it
would
be
pleasanter
for
all
would
it
not
they
agreed
with
her
that
it
would
be
pleasanter
for
all
parties
but
they
did
not
want
to
tax
her
patience
too
much
it
seemed
only
natural
that
she
should
be
longing
to
see
her
mother
i
might
take
you
up
to
new
york
for
a
day
or
two
leon
suggested
and
again
the
beautiful
face
grew
ghastly
pale
with
fear
and
dread
no
i
should
not
like
that
she
said
i
would
prefer
to
have
them
come
here
but
let
us
wait
a
few
days
before
we
invite
them
she
left
them
and
went
away
to
her
own
private
room
locked
the
door
and
threw
herself
down
upon
her
couch
in
a
perfect
passion
of
dread
and
despair
the
coils
of
fate
were
narrowing
around
her
she
could
not
escape
from
the
web
her
own
hands
had
woven
a
few
hours
or
days
at
most
and
then
detection
shame
ignominy
perhaps
banishment
the
thought
quivered
like
a
in
her
heart
will
he
forgive
me
or
will
he
send
me
away
from
him
she
asked
herself
fearfully
she
sat
up
and
looked
with
dazed
heavy
eyes
at
the
elegance
and
luxury
with
which
his
love
had
surrounded
her
at
the
diamonds
on
her
hands
at
her
rich
and
costly
robes
all
mute
tokens
of
the
adoration
in
which
he
held
her
he
loves
me
so
dearly
perhaps
he
will
forgive
me
she
whispered
to
her
beating
heart
i
know
if
he
had
wronged
me
ever
so
bitterly
i
should
forgive
him
and
love
him
still
if
he
prayed
me
on
his
bended
knees
as
i
shall
do
she
pinned
all
her
faith
to
the
strength
of
his
love
and
the
power
of
that
beauty
on
which
he
never
wearied
of
gazing
she
grew
suddenly
alarmed
at
the
pallor
of
her
face
and
the
heaviness
of
her
eyes
she
thought
that
her
beauty
was
deserting
her
that
potent
charm
by
which
she
hoped
to
hold
his
heart
when
he
found
her
out
in
her
sin
i
must
go
out
indeed
she
cried
to
herself
in
sudden
terror
i
must
get
back
my
brightness
and
my
color
i
can
not
afford
to
lose
one
charm
that
may
hold
my
husband
heart
she
forgot
that
he
valued
truth
and
honor
more
than
mere
physical
loveliness
she
forgot
that
he
had
scorned
all
womanhood
for
long
years
because
one
beautiful
woman
had
been
false
to
him
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
her
anguished
yearning
not
to
lose
her
husband
chapter
xxxvii
that
day
on
which
ross
powell
saw
laurel
with
her
husband
was
the
last
of
a
series
of
happy
walks
and
rides
she
had
taken
with
leon
on
that
day
that
closed
in
so
softly
with
the
goldenest
sunshine
and
tenderest
twilight
that
day
seemed
too
fair
for
a
day
of
fate
the
suspended
sword
fell
yet
she
had
never
felt
its
shadow
less
than
she
did
that
day
she
gave
herself
up
blindly
to
her
happiness
prizing
it
all
the
more
because
she
knew
it
could
not
last
when
she
went
to
dress
for
her
drive
that
evening
she
was
most
particular
about
her
toilet
she
chose
a
parisian
robe
of
cream
and
ruby
colors
that
was
particularly
becoming
her
bonnet
was
of
creamy
duchess
lace
and
its
coronet
of
rosebuds
rested
daintily
against
her
rich
golden
waves
of
hair
the
delicate
lace
at
her
throat
was
held
by
a
gold
bar
set
with
pink
coral
and
diamonds
her
boots
and
gloves
were
parisian
her
rose
satin
parasol
shed
a
lovely
glow
over
her
complexion
she
was
lovely
as
a
dream
and
she
looked
the
dainty
aristocrat
from
head
to
foot
leon
le
roy
said
to
himself
with
pardonable
pride
that
he
had
won
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
for
his
wife
she
had
never
enjoyed
a
ride
more
than
she
did
that
afternoon
leon
had
never
been
more
tender
and
devoted
it
was
like
heaven
to
look
up
into
those
dark
speaking
eyes
and
read
the
love
and
adoration
in
his
face
it
filled
her
with
a
great
passionate
rapture
and
delight
she
worshiped
her
noble
husband
with
the
blindest
most
unreasoning
passion
woman
heart
ever
knew
in
him
she
lived
and
moved
and
had
her
being
she
had
forgotten
for
a
little
while
the
brooding
shadow
of
the
sword
that
hung
ever
over
her
head
the
sunshine
was
reflected
in
her
eyes
smiles
were
on
her
lips
when
suddenly
like
a
thunderbolt
falling
from
a
clear
sky
the
sight
of
ross
powell
face
came
before
her
that
evil
face
which
she
both
hated
and
dreaded
remembering
how
he
had
sworn
to
be
revenged
on
her
for
her
just
womanly
scorn
in
that
moment
the
sun
went
out
of
her
sky
the
light
went
out
of
her
life
she
stifled
the
wail
of
dismay
that
rose
to
her
lips
and
sunk
back
among
the
satin
cushions
pale
as
death
her
breath
coming
and
going
in
great
panting
gasps
a
mute
terror
in
the
depths
of
her
wide
dark
eyes
he
recognized
her
she
read
that
in
the
wonder
and
amaze
that
flashed
over
his
face
what
would
he
do
she
asked
herself
she
almost
expected
to
see
him
spring
to
her
horses
heads
and
checking
them
with
a
grasp
of
his
infuriated
hands
charge
her
then
and
there
with
her
sin
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
he
only
stood
and
stared
like
a
man
turned
to
stone
while
they
whirled
past
him
leon
touched
his
hat
courteously
and
in
a
moment
it
was
all
over
they
had
turned
a
bend
in
the
road
and
the
man
standing
there
ignobly
covered
with
the
dust
of
their
was
out
of
sight
leon
turned
to
his
wife
it
is
your
father
clerk
is
it
not
he
was
saying
but
he
paused
stricken
dumb
by
the
sight
of
her
face
he
was
startled
and
frightened
it
was
a
moment
before
speech
came
to
him
then
he
cried
out
in
alarm
beatrix
my
darling
what
is
it
you
are
as
pale
as
a
ghost
are
you
ill
her
voice
sounded
faint
and
even
to
herself
as
she
answered
him
i
felt
a
sudden
pain
in
my
heart
do
not
be
alarmed
leon
i
shall
recover
in
a
moment
he
watched
her
anxiously
and
he
saw
that
she
did
not
recover
herself
very
fast
she
tried
hard
to
shake
off
the
terrible
weight
that
oppressed
her
heart
and
to
be
her
own
natural
self
for
the
few
last
moments
that
were
all
that
remained
to
her
of
the
happiness
that
had
been
so
perfect
and
so
brief
but
she
could
not
do
it
she
could
not
summon
back
the
color
to
her
face
the
smiles
to
her
lips
the
brightness
to
her
eyes
she
could
not
still
the
wild
terrified
beating
of
her
heart
she
felt
a
terrible
choking
sensation
like
one
dying
when
she
spoke
her
voice
had
a
strange
sound
even
to
herself
mr
le
roy
was
frightened
over
his
darling
he
did
not
think
of
connecting
her
sudden
seizure
with
the
appearance
of
ross
powell
he
had
forgotten
the
man
very
existence
in
his
anxiety
when
they
reached
home
he
almost
carried
her
into
the
house
in
his
arms
he
brought
wine
to
her
with
his
own
hands
it
was
only
when
he
saw
that
it
had
revived
her
and
made
her
better
that
he
left
her
to
the
care
of
the
little
french
maid
chapter
xxxviii
mlle
marie
hovered
around
her
mistress
with
many
delicate
attentions
after
her
master
had
departed
but
her
ministrations
were
not
crowned
with
much
success
laurel
lay
still
and
pale
but
consumed
by
an
agony
of
impatience
under
the
dabs
of
de
that
the
maid
bestowed
on
her
cheeks
and
forehead
she
longed
to
be
alone
to
weep
and
wail
aloud
in
her
despair
but
she
could
not
send
the
maid
away
she
knew
that
she
had
to
dress
for
dinner
in
a
little
while
and
as
mrs
le
roy
would
be
down
to
dinner
for
the
first
time
that
day
her
absence
would
be
felt
as
a
great
disappointment
she
would
not
give
up
she
would
keep
up
the
farce
to
the
last
moment
she
lay
there
outwardly
still
and
calm
but
consumed
by
a
burning
suspense
and
unrest
her
hearing
strained
to
its
utmost
as
if
waiting
to
hear
her
accuser
voice
she
wondered
if
ross
powell
would
follow
her
and
denounce
her
surely
he
knew
her
secret
now
she
could
hide
it
from
him
no
longer
in
a
little
while
he
must
know
all
once
a
wild
impulse
of
flight
came
over
her
how
could
she
stay
and
meet
her
husband
scorn
when
he
learned
the
truth
he
worshiped
her
now
as
his
ideal
of
womanhood
what
would
he
say
when
he
knew
her
as
she
was
weak
and
willful
a
girl
who
had
risked
everything
for
the
sake
of
love
would
he
hate
her
for
her
sin
that
would
be
more
bitter
than
death
perhaps
it
were
better
to
go
away
now
before
he
knew
her
at
her
worst
before
he
hated
her
for
deceiving
him
if
she
had
guessed
what
lay
before
her
she
would
have
gone
she
would
have
fled
silently
from
eden
bearing
with
her
for
the
light
of
her
darkened
future
the
memory
of
his
love
alone
his
smiles
his
caresses
his
tender
words
but
the
madness
of
her
love
made
her
stay
i
can
not
go
all
is
not
lost
yet
she
said
faintly
yet
hopefully
to
her
foreboding
heart
he
will
forgive
me
perhaps
for
our
sake
she
knew
that
there
could
be
no
limit
to
her
love
and
forgiveness
for
her
husband
if
he
had
wronged
her
was
it
strange
that
she
should
judge
him
by
herself
she
was
very
young
and
very
ignorant
she
did
not
know
how
truthfully
the
poet
had
written
man
love
is
of
man
life
a
thing
apart
is
woman
whole
existence
when
she
was
dressed
for
dinner
leon
came
to
take
her
down
there
was
a
subdued
happiness
and
excitement
shining
on
his
handsome
face
she
wondered
at
it
but
she
did
not
ask
him
why
she
was
dressed
much
as
she
had
been
on
the
night
when
he
first
told
her
that
he
loved
her
she
wore
white
with
scarlet
jacqueminot
roses
she
had
chosen
the
costume
purposely
thinking
he
would
be
softened
at
the
memories
it
recalled
he
took
his
fair
young
wife
into
his
arms
and
kissed
her
many
times
he
smoothed
the
waving
golden
tresses
with
loving
hands
telling
her
how
dearly
he
loved
her
how
happy
she
made
him
then
even
while
she
clung
to
him
he
released
her
gently
from
his
embrace
not
knowing
it
was
the
last
not
dreaming
of
the
years
to
come
when
his
arms
would
ache
in
vain
to
clasp
her
my
mother
is
waiting
for
you
in
the
he
said
there
is
some
one
with
her
a
visitor
can
you
guess
whom
darling
she
gave
a
terrible
start
a
smothered
cry
and
clung
to
his
arm
with
both
small
white
hands
my
dear
how
nervous
you
are
he
said
one
would
think
you
were
frightened
it
is
your
old
rival
maud
merivale
think
of
her
insufferable
impertinence
in
coming
here
after
that
night
last
summer
but
courage
love
she
will
only
be
consumed
with
envy
when
she
sees
how
much
lovelier
you
have
grown
since
you
became
my
wife
she
tried
to
murmur
some
careless
reply
but
her
heart
leaped
with
fear
another
enemy
too
surely
the
coils
of
fate
were
closing
round
her
they
went
down
the
broad
staircase
along
the
lighted
hall
and
so
into
the
brilliant
the
handsome
man
with
the
lovely
girl
borne
proudly
on
his
arm
she
looked
up
and
saw
mrs
le
roy
smiling
at
her
merivale
rustling
toward
her
in
gloss
of
satin
and
glimmer
of
pearls
and
beyond
her
two
others
a
man
and
a
woman
both
strangers
they
were
rising
eagerly
too
coming
toward
her
with
smiles
and
outstretched
hands
a
dim
perception
flashed
over
laurel
her
heart
felt
like
a
stone
in
her
breast
chapter
xxxix
it
was
a
supreme
moment
laurel
felt
it
to
be
such
her
heart
beat
her
limbs
trembled
beneath
her
but
for
the
support
of
arm
she
must
have
fallen
to
the
earth
she
wondered
that
she
did
not
faint
rather
that
she
did
not
die
for
an
intuition
swift
as
the
lightning
flash
told
her
that
these
two
strangers
were
gordon
and
his
wife
she
had
never
seen
them
in
her
life
but
she
did
not
for
one
moment
doubt
their
identity
she
saw
merivale
modestly
giving
place
to
them
allowing
them
to
greet
her
first
she
saw
the
smile
of
pleasure
on
leon
lips
leon
who
thought
she
was
having
such
a
pleasant
surprise
she
could
not
move
nor
speak
she
clung
desperately
to
leon
arm
and
they
came
nearer
and
nearer
the
tall
rather
man
and
the
pretty
faded
blonde
in
her
rich
silks
and
laces
laurel
gazed
at
them
with
her
great
dark
frightened
eyes
much
as
the
little
princes
in
the
tower
might
have
gazed
upon
their
murderers
a
great
horror
grew
upon
her
as
if
indeed
they
were
about
to
strike
her
dead
she
had
been
caught
in
a
horrible
trap
a
pit
of
destruction
yawned
beneath
her
feet
in
a
moment
she
would
be
hurled
down
down
down
into
fathomless
darkness
and
despair
gordon
drew
nearer
and
nearer
there
was
a
tender
smile
on
the
fair
delicate
face
and
the
blue
eyes
looked
straight
into
own
for
an
instant
only
an
instant
for
then
she
started
backward
and
her
cry
of
dismay
and
wonder
pealed
on
the
impostor
ears
like
the
knell
of
doom
beatrix
oh
my
god
it
is
not
beatrix
what
does
this
mean
it
is
not
beatrix
gordon
echoed
blankly
and
for
a
moment
there
reigned
a
terrible
silence
in
the
room
leon
le
roy
looked
down
at
his
wife
she
was
clinging
to
his
arm
with
the
desperation
of
despair
her
face
was
pale
as
death
and
convulsed
with
fear
her
wide
frightened
dark
eyes
stared
up
straight
into
his
with
a
hunted
look
in
their
somber
depth
that
pierced
his
heart
beatrix
what
do
they
mean
he
cried
have
they
all
gone
mad
her
white
lips
tried
to
syllable
the
word
mad
but
it
died
upon
them
in
a
straining
gasp
gordon
came
slowly
forward
a
dazed
expression
on
his
features
mr
le
roy
there
must
be
some
mistake
he
said
this
lady
is
not
your
wife
leon
answered
gravely
there
is
no
mistake
this
is
my
wife
mr
gordon
gordon
cried
out
startlingly
then
where
is
our
daughter
she
looked
ready
to
faint
her
limbs
tottered
beneath
her
she
clung
to
her
husband
with
one
hand
pressed
upon
her
throbbing
heart
and
stared
at
the
lovely
creature
on
leon
arm
as
if
she
were
a
ghost
mrs
le
roy
still
pale
and
wan
from
her
recent
illness
rose
from
the
couch
where
she
reclined
and
tottered
to
her
side
my
dear
friends
have
you
all
taken
leave
of
your
senses
she
cried
have
you
forgotten
your
own
daughter
face
beatrix
darling
why
do
you
not
come
to
your
mother
only
a
stifled
moan
came
from
laurel
lips
but
gordon
answered
sternly
this
is
no
daughter
of
ours
we
have
never
seen
her
face
before
and
merivale
in
the
background
gazed
in
gloating
wonder
and
triumph
at
the
pale
horrified
face
of
leon
wife
she
was
burning
with
anxiety
to
hear
the
of
this
strange
and
startling
scene
this
is
no
daughter
of
ours
we
have
never
seen
her
face
before
repeated
gordon
and
his
wife
feebly
reiterated
his
words
you
have
gone
mad
both
of
you
mrs
le
roy
cried
out
fretfully
this
is
your
daughter
whom
you
sent
to
us
and
whom
my
son
married
how
dare
you
deny
it
speak
to
them
leon
speak
to
them
beatrix
do
not
let
them
deny
you
it
is
monstrous
it
is
terrible
she
is
no
child
of
ours
she
will
not
claim
to
be
she
is
a
miserable
impostor
look
at
her
guilty
face
said
gordon
pointing
a
scornful
finger
at
the
white
face
that
did
indeed
look
and
full
of
guilty
woe
leon
had
never
taken
his
eyes
from
that
beautiful
terrified
face
he
spoke
to
her
now
and
his
voice
sounded
hollow
and
stern
beatrix
what
do
they
mean
is
it
true
that
you
are
not
daughter
the
white
hands
slipped
from
his
arm
and
she
fell
on
her
knees
before
him
lifting
up
her
woful
white
face
pleadingly
oh
leon
pity
and
forgive
me
she
moaned
appealingly
it
is
true
and
i
have
bitterly
deceived
you
i
am
not
beatrix
gordon
chapter
xl
a
silence
like
death
fell
for
a
moment
on
the
group
that
closed
around
that
pathetic
kneeling
figure
with
its
white
uplifted
face
and
streaming
golden
hair
leon
voice
broke
it
first
hoarse
and
terribly
stern
if
you
are
not
beatrix
gordon
for
god
sake
tell
us
you
are
and
she
answered
in
a
voice
shaken
by
blended
triumph
and
despair
i
am
your
wife
leon
do
not
forget
that
gordon
springing
forward
shook
her
wildly
by
the
arm
look
at
me
girl
she
cried
what
have
you
done
with
my
daughter
my
beatrix
why
are
you
here
in
her
place
the
great
dark
eyes
heavy
with
despair
turned
slowly
on
her
face
you
are
her
mother
she
said
yes
i
am
her
mother
gordon
answered
impatiently
tell
me
girl
what
have
you
done
with
my
darling
and
laurel
answered
in
a
tone
of
the
most
pathetic
wonder
and
reproach
you
are
her
mother
and
yet
you
did
not
love
her
enough
to
make
her
happy
you
forget
that
is
lord
of
all
oh
why
did
not
you
let
her
be
happy
in
her
own
fashion
then
all
this
need
not
have
happened
you
drive
me
mad
with
your
strange
answers
wailed
gordon
will
no
one
make
her
speak
and
tell
me
my
child
fate
she
looked
around
helplessly
into
their
wondering
faces
leon
stood
white
and
moveless
as
a
marble
statue
his
arms
folded
tightly
over
his
broad
breast
his
pale
brow
beaded
with
chilly
drops
of
sweat
his
eyes
never
turning
from
that
kneeling
figure
mrs
le
roy
overcome
with
agitation
had
sunk
upon
her
sofa
gasping
for
breath
maud
merivale
gazed
on
the
scene
with
a
face
of
evil
joy
and
gordon
looked
dazed
like
one
staggering
under
a
horrible
burden
but
at
his
piteous
appeal
he
went
slowly
forward
and
touched
the
arm
of
the
convicted
impostor
you
hear
he
said
you
are
driving
us
mad
with
your
evasions
where
is
my
daughter
is
she
dead
a
shudder
ran
through
them
all
at
that
ominous
word
but
laurel
sprung
to
her
feet
suddenly
and
faced
him
with
an
almost
defiant
gleam
in
her
eyes
a
dull
red
glow
flared
into
her
cheeks
and
she
drew
her
graceful
figure
haughtily
erect
as
she
extended
one
slender
hand
at
the
agitated
speaker
do
you
think
that
i
have
murdered
her
that
you
look
at
me
so
fiercely
she
cried
do
you
think
i
would
harm
one
hair
of
her
lovely
golden
head
she
who
was
so
kind
to
me
in
my
desolation
and
despair
no
no
she
is
not
dead
your
daughter
whom
you
tried
to
separate
from
her
own
true
lover
she
is
well
and
happy
she
is
married
to
cyril
wentworth
and
gone
abroad
with
him
married
almost
shrieked
gordon
and
her
husband
echoed
blankly
married
yes
she
is
married
laurel
answered
almost
triumphantly
she
took
her
fate
into
her
own
hands
and
sought
happiness
with
her
lover
married
to
cyril
wentworth
how
dared
she
how
dared
she
gordon
wailed
aloud
in
frantic
anger
and
laurel
looking
at
her
gravely
answered
with
unconscious
pathos
women
dare
everything
for
love
sake
you
know
mrs
gordon
the
chagrined
disappointed
mother
broke
into
low
hysterical
sobs
and
tears
gordon
drew
her
gently
to
his
side
and
turned
his
cold
stern
gaze
upon
laurel
and
you
how
came
you
here
in
beatrix
place
he
asked
she
sent
me
here
laurel
answered
she
had
been
kind
to
me
and
i
paid
my
debt
of
gratitude
by
taking
her
place
here
while
she
went
away
and
married
mr
wentworth
she
felt
their
eyes
burning
upon
her
as
she
spoke
she
knew
that
they
hated
her
for
what
she
had
done
she
felt
a
dim
passing
wonder
how
she
could
stand
there
and
bear
it
she
wondered
that
she
did
not
scream
out
aloud
or
fall
down
dead
at
their
feet
but
a
strange
mechanical
calmness
upheld
her
through
it
all
this
is
the
strangest
story
i
ever
heard
said
gordon
can
it
be
that
beatrix
lent
herself
to
such
a
plot
tell
me
all
about
it
there
is
almost
nothing
to
tell
beyond
what
i
have
told
you
she
said
she
despaired
of
ever
winning
your
consent
to
her
marriage
and
she
could
not
give
up
her
lover
so
she
sent
me
here
with
clarice
to
act
a
part
while
she
married
her
lover
then
they
kept
it
secret
while
they
waited
for
wentworth
promised
european
appointment
when
he
received
it
she
went
abroad
with
him
i
saw
her
myself
in
london
she
is
perfectly
happy
only
for
her
longing
to
be
forgiven
by
her
parents
i
will
never
forgive
her
the
false
deceitful
jade
he
uttered
fiercely
she
turned
to
him
pleadingly
do
not
be
hard
upon
your
beautiful
daughter
she
prayed
she
loved
him
so
dearly
she
could
not
live
without
him
oh
you
must
forgive
her
never
never
gordon
sobbed
bitterly
vain
proud
ambitious
woman
as
she
was
her
heart
was
almost
broken
by
this
terrible
shock
gordon
voice
broke
scornfully
upon
laurel
tumultuous
thoughts
and
this
dutiful
daughter
of
mine
did
she
add
to
her
iniquities
by
arranging
a
marriage
for
you
did
she
teach
you
to
deceive
this
honorable
gentleman
and
trap
him
into
a
marriage
with
a
wretched
impostor
the
harsh
words
struck
her
like
the
stinging
cut
of
a
lash
she
shivered
and
dropped
her
eyes
but
she
did
not
flinch
from
answering
him
a
marvelous
bravery
upheld
her
while
she
confessed
her
fault
and
exonerated
beatrix
mine
is
the
fault
she
said
if
your
daughter
had
suspected
the
madness
that
filled
me
she
would
have
betrayed
me
she
would
never
have
tolerated
it
for
one
hour
she
wished
me
to
go
abroad
with
her
she
did
not
dream
of
the
truth
but
i
i
sent
clarice
back
to
her
and
i
stayed
on
at
eden
the
fault
is
mine
the
consequences
her
voice
faltered
almost
to
a
moan
be
upon
my
own
head
leon
had
never
yet
spoken
a
word
pale
he
stood
his
hearing
strained
to
catch
every
word
that
fell
from
the
lips
of
his
wife
his
wife
whom
he
had
believed
to
be
an
angel
but
whom
he
now
knew
as
a
false
and
reckless
woman
who
had
stolen
into
his
home
and
heart
under
a
lying
guise
and
you
said
gordon
sternly
who
are
you
that
have
dared
do
this
terrible
wrong
what
is
your
name
whence
came
you
she
turned
suddenly
and
lifted
her
dark
anguished
eyes
to
her
husband
face
in
mute
wonder
and
entreaty
in
its
lightning
scorn
its
terrible
indignation
she
read
her
doom
with
a
moan
of
despair
she
let
the
long
dark
lashes
fall
until
they
shaded
her
burning
cheeks
and
answered
gordon
do
not
ask
me
my
name
nor
my
history
what
can
it
matter
to
you
who
hate
me
my
heart
is
broken
let
me
shroud
myself
in
merciful
mystery
you
refuse
to
disclose
your
identity
said
gordon
wonderingly
i
refuse
she
answered
with
a
reckless
defiance
born
of
despair
and
at
that
moment
a
mocking
laugh
cruel
as
a
fiend
rang
startlingly
through
the
splendid
room
every
eye
turned
toward
the
sound
through
the
wide
lace
curtains
that
shaded
the
low
french
windows
a
man
stepped
into
the
room
ross
powell
laurel
saw
him
and
a
shriek
of
despair
rose
from
her
lips
at
the
sight
of
her
enemy
evil
triumphant
face
she
covered
her
face
with
her
trembling
hands
and
sunk
down
upon
the
floor
crouching
like
a
guilty
creature
from
the
angry
judges
surrounding
her
ross
powell
went
forward
to
his
employer
gordon
sir
he
said
respectfully
you
wish
to
know
the
name
of
this
matchless
hypocrite
and
deceiver
i
can
soon
enlighten
you
speak
then
gordon
answered
quickly
gazing
at
his
clerk
in
surprise
and
wonder
you
remember
vane
the
drunken
writer
who
died
almost
a
year
ago
said
ross
powell
brutally
yes
but
what
has
louis
vane
to
do
with
this
mysterious
girl
inquired
gordon
bluntly
everything
answered
the
villain
sarcastically
for
this
fine
lady
the
mistress
of
eden
is
old
vane
daughter
no
exclaimed
gordon
astonished
yes
triumphantly
her
name
is
laurel
vane
and
she
belonged
to
me
she
was
promised
to
me
but
when
her
tippling
father
drank
himself
to
death
she
ran
away
and
though
i
have
been
on
her
track
ever
since
i
could
never
find
her
until
and
no
wonder
for
with
her
humble
antecedents
i
never
dreamed
of
looking
for
my
runaway
sweetheart
in
the
wife
of
the
aristocratic
mr
le
roy
slow
cold
stinging
every
word
fell
on
laurel
heart
like
a
drop
of
ice
she
sprung
to
her
feet
and
faced
him
her
dark
eyes
blazing
with
scorn
and
wrath
yes
i
am
laurel
vane
that
is
true
she
cried
but
every
other
word
you
have
uttered
ross
powell
is
a
base
and
cruel
lie
i
never
belonged
to
you
i
have
never
seen
you
but
once
or
twice
in
my
life
and
then
i
feared
and
hated
you
as
one
hates
the
slimy
crawling
serpent
i
have
never
belonged
to
any
man
but
mr
le
roy
after
the
terrible
way
in
which
you
have
deceived
mr
le
roy
you
will
not
find
him
willing
to
believe
your
later
assertions
sneered
the
wretch
the
wretched
young
creature
turned
again
and
looked
at
her
husband
but
he
still
preserved
his
quiet
position
his
arms
folded
over
his
lips
set
in
a
thin
hard
line
his
eyes
blazing
with
a
gloomy
lurid
fire
beneath
the
broad
massive
brow
that
was
beaded
with
great
chilly
drops
of
dew
it
was
the
darkest
hour
of
his
life
his
humiliation
was
almost
greater
than
he
could
bear
there
was
no
tenderness
no
pity
in
his
somber
gaze
as
it
met
the
wild
appealing
eyes
of
the
girl
who
had
deceived
him
but
she
went
to
him
she
stood
humbly
and
suppliantly
before
him
her
face
lighted
with
passionate
love
and
appeal
upheld
by
the
strength
of
her
girlish
will
longing
to
be
forgiven
for
her
sin
and
taken
to
his
heart
again
leon
he
speaks
falsely
she
said
i
never
belonged
to
him
i
never
saw
him
until
after
my
father
death
and
then
he
basely
insulted
my
helplessness
and
poverty
in
my
anger
i
struck
him
in
the
face
and
he
swore
revenge
for
the
blow
you
see
how
he
takes
it
in
vilifying
my
name
do
not
listen
to
him
my
husband
i
have
never
loved
but
you
never
belonged
to
any
one
but
you
i
deceived
you
in
the
one
thing
only
will
you
not
believe
me
his
stern
lips
parted
to
answer
her
but
maud
merivale
rushed
forward
and
shook
him
violently
by
the
arm
leon
look
to
your
mother
she
cried
she
has
fainted
he
turned
and
looked
and
saw
that
it

rudely
by

looked
down
into
the

mockingly
you

and
fell
like
a

heavily
to
the
floor

xli
leon
lifted
his
mother
senseless
form
and
bore
her
away
to
her
room
gordon
lay
weeping
moaning
and
wildly
lamenting
in
her
husband
arms
ross
powell
having
accomplished
his
wicked
work
and
finding
himself
unnoticed
stole
quietly
away
from
the
scene
of
his
villainy
no
one
seemed
to
heed
the
prostrate
form
lying
prone
upon
the
floor
like
one
dead
the
face
with
its
closed
eyes
and
lashes
upturned
to
the
light
no
one
save
merivale
and
she
actually
spurned
it
with
her
dainty
foot
and
glared
upon
it
with
envenomed
hatred
in
her
eyes
the
little
viper
she
muttered
bitterly
oh
that
i
had
known
the
truth
when
i
was
here
last
summer
how
i
should
have
exulted
in
betraying
her
to
my
haughty
lord
who
laughed
at
my
love
and
scorned
me
because
once
i
was
false
to
the
trust
he
placed
in
me
she
was
an
angel
forsooth
ha
ha
i
would
not
have
missed
this
rich
scene
for
ten
thousand
dollars
what
has
become
of
that
man
who
came
so
opportunely
upon
the
scene
i
must
see
him
it
may
be
worth
my
while
she
cast
a
glance
of
hate
and
scorn
upon
laurel
silent
recumbent
figure
then
hastened
to
the
window
and
glided
out
the
heavy
curtains
of
silk
and
lace
falling
noiselessly
together
behind
her
retreating
form
the
great
gilded
with
its
brilliant
chandeliers
and
myriad
flowers
was
deserted
now
save
for
the
half
frantic
gordons
and
the
unconscious
girl
upon
the
floor
unnoticed
and
deserted
she
struggled
back
to
life
and
found
herself
alone
save
for
those
two
who
gazed
upon
her
with
reproach
and
hatred
as
the
cause
of
their
desolation
she
had
lent
herself
to
the
plot
to
rob
them
of
their
daughter
and
they
could
not
forgive
her
any
more
than
they
could
forgive
beatrix
for
her
unfilial
desertion
but
she
went
and
stood
before
them
so
beautiful
in
her
sorrow
and
despair
with
her
disheveled
golden
tresses
and
the
red
roses
dying
on
her
breast
that
they
could
almost
have
pitied
her
in
her
tender
youth
and
grief
if
only
she
had
not
helped
beatrix
to
her
happiness
and
spoiled
their
clever
scheme
for
separating
her
from
her
handsome
penniless
lover
i
have
wronged
you
she
said
sadly
i
know
that
but
believe
me
i
could
not
help
it
she
your
daughter
had
been
kind
to
me
and
i
promised
her
my
eternal
gratitude
when
she
claimed
my
promise
what
could
i
do
but
yield
and
and
she
is
very
happy
you
must
not
forget
that
when
you
think
of
her
perhaps
you
may
forgive
me
when
you
know
that
she
is
so
perfectly
happy
forgive
they
uttered
scornfully
for
the
thought
that
beatrix
was
happy
in
her
stolen
marriage
was
like
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
to
them
they
felt
hard
and
vindictive
toward
their
beautiful
willful
child
they
would
have
been
glad
to
hear
that
she
was
ill
unhappy
repentant
starving
even
anything
but
happy
you
will
forgive
me
and
forgive
her
pleaded
the
hapless
girl
never
they
answered
harshly
hardening
their
hearts
against
the
two
young
creatures
who
had
carried
out
that
daring
conspiracy
and
laurel
began
to
realize
the
enormity
of
what
she
had
done
it
had
not
seemed
so
bad
to
her
at
first
this
helping
a
fair
young
girl
and
her
lover
to
be
happy
in
spite
of
opposition
she
remembered
that
clarice
had
called
it
a
splendid
joke
and
beatrix
had
laughed
at
her
scruples
but
it
was
quite
another
thing
to
the
gordons
it
was
a
cruel
outrage
and
beyond
pardon
she
stood
looking
at
their
cold
frowning
faces
a
moment
then
turned
hopelessly
away
every
one
was
against
her
if
only
leon
would
forgive
her
she
would
not
care
for
the
rest
she
thought
but
alas
his
love
is
turned
to
hate
she
sighed
he
will
never
forgive
me
he
will
drive
me
away
from
him
into
eternal
banishment
my
brief
dream
of
happiness
is
over
and
yet
i
was
mad
enough
to
think
that
out
of
his
great
love
he
would
forgive
me
ah
me
ah
me
gordon
led
his
wife
silently
from
the
room
without
a
glance
at
her
she
was
alone
in
the
great
gilded
deserted
and
alone
in
her
terrible
anguish
and
despair
the
sting
of
their
contempt
pierced
her
heart
i
am
despised
and
deserted
by
all
she
said
sorrowfully
what
shall
i
do
must
i
go
away
would
leon
like
it
would
he
be
glad
never
to
see
me
again
something
like
a
wail
of
anguish
came
from
her
lips
at
the
thought
of
leaving
her
husband
and
never
seeing
him
again
it
was
more
bitter
than
death
she
thought
of
his
passionate
idolizing
love
had
it
all
been
murdered
at
one
fell
stroke
by
the
knowledge
of
her
sin
the
door
opened
and
he
came
suddenly
into
the
room
he
saw
her
standing
there
the
only
creature
in
the
wide
brilliant
he
knew
that
every
one
had
deserted
her
for
her
sin
that
fatal
retribution
had
overtaken
her
his
own
heart
had
revolted
from
its
allegiance
now
that
he
knew
her
for
the
willful
creature
of
clay
that
she
was
instead
of
the
angel
he
had
deemed
her
yet
never
had
her
perfect
beauty
struck
him
more
forcibly
than
now
robbed
of
its
light
its
coloring
its
bloom
its
perfection
still
showed
supreme
like
the
beauty
of
a
perfectly
chiseled
statue
she
ran
to
him
she
threw
herself
humbly
at
his
feet
there
with
her
arms
and
shadowy
hair
she
made
her
face
a
darkness
forgive
me
my
husband
forgive
me
prayed
the
wretched
wife
chapter
xlii
he
stood
there
in
silence
looking
down
at
that
bowed
head
veiled
by
its
sweeping
golden
hair
he
made
no
effort
to
raise
her
he
answered
not
a
word
to
her
wild
appeal
there
was
a
smoldering
fire
in
his
dark
eyes
a
stern
compression
of
his
lips
that
boded
ill
for
the
granting
of
her
prayer
he
had
received
a
terrible
shock
his
love
and
his
pride
alike
had
been
outraged
and
in
his
case
it
was
a
strong
love
and
a
strong
pride
the
wound
to
both
was
accordingly
all
the
greater
his
strange
silence
grew
terrible
to
her
she
lifted
her
face
a
little
and
looked
at
him
recoiling
from
the
terrible
indignation
in
his
eyes
as
if
he
had
struck
her
a
blow
leon
speak
to
me
she
wailed
oh
you
will
not
be
hard
and
unforgiving
to
me
i
have
wronged
you
and
deceived
you
i
know
but
it
was
all
because
i
loved
you
no
woman
ever
loved
with
so
mad
a
love
as
i
have
given
you
if
i
had
not
loved
you
so
dearly
i
had
not
dared
so
much
he
spoke
then
there
was
concentrated
passion
burning
contempt
in
his
deep
and
angry
voice
do
not
speak
of
love
he
said
i
can
fancy
with
what
love
the
drunken
journalist
daughter
the
poor
clerk
runaway
could
love
leon
le
roy
i
can
imagine
that
the
temptation
to
lift
yourself
to
my
level
from
the
dust
where
you
groveled
was
too
strong
for
you
i
can
fancy
that
the
greed
for
wealth
and
honor
led
you
astray
but
love
faugh
if
one
spark
of
that
divine
passion
had
burned
in
your
scheming
breast
you
would
have
respected
the
unsullied
honor
the
proud
old
name
of
the
le
roys
you
would
have
spared
me
the
disgraceful
alliance
with
a
drunkard
daughter
slow
cruel
bitter
every
word
fell
like
a
coal
of
fire
on
her
bleeding
heart
was
it
the
gifted
father
the
brilliant
genius
whom
she
had
loved
and
revered
despite
his
weakness
who
was
thus
stigmatized
as
a
drunkard
by
her
husband
lips
had
that
father
sin
indeed
set
her
apart
as
a
mark
for
the
finger
of
scorn
to
point
at
a
creature
too
low
to
even
lift
her
eyes
to
the
proud
and
rich
leon
le
roy
it
was
a
cruel
a
bitter
insult
it
rankled
like
a
sword
point
in
her
heart
she
rose
slowly
to
her
feet
and
faced
him
with
a
strange
dignity
that
sat
gracefully
on
her
perfect
beauty
she
did
not
speak
but
waited
with
drooping
head
and
tightly
folded
hands
for
his
further
words
they
came
still
further
blighting
the
sad
young
heart
there
can
be
no
talk
of
forgiveness
between
you
and
me
you
have
injured
me
beyond
reparation
you
can
be
nothing
to
me
henceforth
you
will
send
me
away
from
you
you
will
divorce
me
she
asked
with
a
shiver
no
i
will
have
no
scandal
i
will
not
drag
the
proud
name
of
le
roy
through
the
mire
of
a
divorce
court
that
for
which
you
schemed
so
craftily
shall
not
be
taken
away
from
you
i
shall
go
away
and
leave
you
at
eden
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
wealth
and
the
name
you
have
won
then
our
tacit
separation
and
divorce
will
be
accomplished
i
shall
never
willingly
look
upon
your
beautiful
false
face
again
she
bowed
her
head
in
speechless
acquiescence
where
were
the
wild
words
the
matchless
eloquence
with
which
she
meant
to
plead
her
cause
to
implore
for
pardon
when
this
dark
hour
came
upon
her
that
love
and
beauty
which
she
had
deemed
such
powerful
agents
to
hold
his
heart
and
win
his
clemency
of
what
avail
were
they
now
his
icy
scorn
his
proud
decisive
determination
left
no
room
for
dissent
or
appeal
the
terrible
weight
of
her
sin
had
fallen
upon
her
and
crushed
her
i
think
you
understand
me
he
said
the
wife
i
loved
is
as
one
dead
to
me
she
never
existed
save
in
my
imagination
you
must
accept
this
as
your
punishment
if
indeed
you
can
feel
any
remorse
for
your
falsehood
and
deceit
now
go
to
your
room
and
let
your
maid
attend
you
there
i
presume
you
will
not
care
to
meet
our
guests
again
i
am
quite
sure
they
will
not
wish
to
see
you
remain
in
seclusion
i
will
make
all
needful
arrangements
for
our
separation
and
they
shall
be
duly
communicated
to
you
she
lifted
her
head
and
gave
one
long
grave
look
from
her
heavy
somber
eyes
at
the
handsome
haughty
face
bowed
slowly
and
went
out
of
the
room
the
slow
swish
of
her
trailing
satin
robe
echoed
drearily
in
his
hearing
as
he
stood
there
pale
and
but
he
did
not
turn
his
head
for
one
farewell
glance
at
the
girl
who
was
his
wife
and
who
had
so
terribly
deceived
him
she
went
to
her
room
and
sunk
down
wearily
upon
her
sofa
marie
the
maid
came
in
presently
her
face
showed
that
she
knew
all
marie
she
said
go
and
ask
mrs
le
roy
if
she
will
permit
me
to
come
to
her
for
a
few
moments
the
maid
returned
in
a
moment
mr
le
roy
is
with
his
mother
he
desires
that
you
will
not
disturb
her
she
said
laurel
answered
quietly
you
may
go
away
and
leave
me
now
marie
i
wish
to
be
alone
for
awhile
when
the
maid
had
gone
she
went
to
the
window
drew
back
the
rich
curtains
of
silk
and
lace
and
gazed
out
upon
the
scene
night
had
fallen
the
beautiful
moonlit
summer
night
the
perfume
of
roses
and
honeysuckles
came
floating
heavily
on
the
soft
air
the
wide
expanse
of
the
hudson
shone
like
a
silver
sea
i
must
go
away
from
eden
said
the
to
herself
drearily
what
shall
i
do
with
my
empty
ruined
life
strangely
enough
there
came
to
her
a
memory
of
the
day
she
had
first
met
leon
le
roy
the
questions
she
had
asked
him
and
his
strange
reply
i
believe
i
should
throw
myself
into
yonder
beautiful
river
and
so
end
all
he
had
said
chapter
xliii
mlle
marie
was
very
glad
to
get
away
from
attendance
on
her
mistress
for
a
few
hours
there
is
nothing
happens
in
the
parlor
but
is
immediately
communicated
to
the
kitchen
so
the
in
high
life
had
immediately
become
the
sensation
in
low
life
below
stairs
the
maid
was
eager
to
join
the
gossips
so
laurel
remained
alone
and
undisturbed
in
the
elegant
rooms
where
she
had
spent
such
happy
hours
with
the
husband
who
now
disowned
and
abandoned
her
she
stared
out
into
the
beautiful
summer
night
with
dark
inscrutable
eyes
trying
dimly
to
pierce
the
veil
that
hid
the
future
from
her
aching
sight
leon
le
roy
remained
in
attendance
on
his
mother
the
poor
lady
in
her
weak
enfeebled
state
had
sustained
a
terrible
shock
she
had
fallen
from
one
fainting
spell
to
another
and
the
nurse
and
her
son
remained
constantly
by
her
side
at
length
she
recovered
her
reason
and
was
given
a
composing
draught
she
fell
into
a
light
slumber
and
leon
stole
away
and
consummated
that
fatal
interview
with
his
wife
then
returned
to
watch
by
the
invalid
couch
he
did
not
intend
to
deny
his
wife
an
interview
with
his
mother
though
he
did
not
think
it
would
avail
her
anything
believing
that
she
would
take
sides
with
himself
against
the
wife
who
had
so
bitterly
deceived
him
he
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
allow
a
meeting
between
them
that
night
so
when
marie
came
he
returned
the
curt
message
that
swept
the
last
hope
from
laurel
heart
and
as
it
seemed
the
last
plank
from
between
her
and
despair
mrs
le
roy
slumbered
fitfully
until
midnight
leon
sent
the
nurse
to
the
lounge
in
the
and
kept
vigil
himself
by
the
looking
more
like
a
statue
than
a
man
as
he
sat
there
in
the
shaded
pale
and
moveless
as
if
carved
in
marble
his
lips
compressed
sternly
a
smoldering
fire
burning
in
his
veiled
dark
eyes
his
mind
was
busy
with
thought
and
memory
he
was
going
over
step
by
step
his
acquaintance
with
the
false
beatrix
gordon
from
the
day
when
she
had
first
stood
shy
and
frightened
in
the
doorway
of
eden
until
he
held
the
key
now
to
many
a
subtle
enigma
that
had
puzzled
him
in
those
past
days
so
fair
so
young
and
seemingly
so
ignorant
of
the
world
and
yet
so
false
he
said
to
himself
false
to
her
lover
ross
powell
first
then
doubly
false
in
wedding
me
in
borrowed
plumes
there
is
no
faith
nor
truth
in
woman
they
are
bad
and
mercenary
to
the
core
all
of
them
except
my
honored
mother
yet
my
wife
has
the
face
of
an
angel
who
would
have
believed
that
the
greed
of
gold
could
have
tempted
her
to
such
a
sin
mrs
le
roy
stirred
and
opened
her
eyes
they
rested
wistfully
on
the
stern
impassive
face
of
her
son
your
wife
leon
she
said
faintly
have
you
forgiven
her
could
there
be
any
forgiveness
for
such
falsity
as
hers
mother
he
asked
turning
sternly
toward
her
a
sigh
breathed
over
mrs
le
roy
lips
she
was
such
a
child
she
said
plaintively
almost
excusingly
have
you
given
her
any
chance
to
exculpate
herself
my
son
could
any
exculpation
be
acceptable
he
asked
again
sternly
where
is
she
what
has
been
done
to
her
she
asked
anxiously
he
told
her
his
decision
told
her
all
that
he
had
said
to
his
wife
in
his
outraged
pride
and
wrath
she
was
weeping
bitterly
when
he
had
finished
mother
surely
you
do
not
blame
me
and
excuse
her
he
said
wonderingly
i
had
no
thought
but
that
you
would
take
my
part
against
her
i
must
see
her
first
she
said
almost
angrily
in
her
deep
earnestness
i
can
not
condemn
her
unheard
you
will
let
me
see
the
child
st
leon
of
course
he
answered
impatiently
you
do
not
suppose
i
would
deny
any
wish
of
that
kind
you
choose
to
express
mother
but
you
are
too
ill
and
nervous
you
will
wait
until
oh
my
son
do
not
be
angry
with
me
i
can
not
wait
send
her
to
me
now
she
wept
i
am
quite
sure
you
had
better
wait
until
he
began
but
at
that
moment
mlle
marie
pushed
open
the
door
and
looked
in
with
a
pale
frightened
face
is
mrs
le
roy
here
she
asked
because
she
is
not
in
her
room
and
i
can
not
find
her
anywhere
leon
you
have
driven
her
away
his
mother
cried
out
wildly
he
sprung
to
his
feet
in
dismay
no
no
he
said
quickly
do
not
think
such
a
thing
mother
stay
here
marie
i
will
go
and
find
her
if
she
can
be
found
she
is
not
far
of
course
but
all
the
same
a
hand
of
ice
seemed
to
grip
his
heart
as
he
hurried
from
the
room
she
was
gone
the
bride
whom
he
had
loved
so
well
and
who
had
so
fatally
deceived
him
while
marie
gossiped
with
her
familiars
she
had
quietly
stolen
away
a
little
note
lay
on
her
i
have
gone
away
my
husband
it
said
i
shall
never
trouble
your
peace
again
perhaps
when
i
am
dead
you
will
forgive
me
for
having
loved
you
wisely
but
too
well
and
to
the
pathetic
note
she
had
simply
signed
the
despised
name
of
laurel
vane
the
white
satin
dress
the
withered
crimson
roses
lay
on
the
floor
the
jewels
she
had
worn
some
costly
sparkling
rubies
on
her
beside
the
little
note
a
simple
and
close
hat
and
veil
were
gone
from
her
wardrobe
but
the
next
morning
the
veil
and
a
pair
of
pretty
dark
kid
gloves
with
the
dimpled
impress
of
her
hand
still
in
them
were
found
upon
the
river
bank
close
to
the
greedy
gurgling
waves
they
suggested
a
horrible
possibility
to
every
one
and
one
week
later
a
mutilated
unrecognizable
body
was
washed
upon
the
shore
near
eden
the
face
was
defaced
beyond
recognition
but
the
golden
hair
the
dark
dress
the
dainty
linen
were
like
laurel
no
one
doubted
that
the
despairing
wife
had
sought
oblivion
from
her
woes
in
the
deep
swirling
river
if
leon
forgave
her
now
for
her
sin
he
made
no
sign
he
remained
silent
grave
inscrutable
but
the
waif
from
the
river
was
buried
quietly
in
the
le
roy
vault
with
all
the
honors
due
to
his
wife
he
shed
no
tears
he
spoke
no
word
of
the
feelings
that
held
sway
within
him
the
separation
of
death
was
no
wider
than
he
had
meant
should
exist
in
life
but
mrs
le
roy
was
inconsolable
she
wept
bitterly
for
the
who
had
so
deceived
her
she
forgave
her
for
her
sin
because
she
was
so
young
and
had
loved
leon
so
dearly
and
there
was
another
reason
which
one
day
through
her
bitter
lamentations
she
revealed
to
leon
you
must
have
forgiven
her
if
you
had
known
it
leon
she
said
but
she
was
so
shy
and
she
had
only
known
it
a
little
while
herself
she
told
me
first
and
i
was
so
happy
over
the
news
there
was
soon
to
be
a
little
heir
to
eden
chapter
xliv
laurel
had
left
her
veil
and
gloves
on
the
bank
of
the
river
with
a
deliberate
purpose
she
desired
that
her
angry
unforgiving
husband
should
believe
that
she
was
dead
since
he
had
deliberately
planned
to
put
her
out
of
his
life
forever
he
would
no
doubt
be
glad
to
think
that
she
was
dead
so
with
a
heart
full
of
bitterness
and
wounded
love
she
had
penned
that
pathetic
note
to
him
and
gone
away
all
her
trembling
hopes
were
over
now
she
knew
the
worst
leon
would
never
forgive
her
for
the
deceit
by
which
she
had
made
herself
his
wife
he
had
forgotten
his
love
indeed
she
did
not
doubt
but
that
he
hated
her
now
and
believed
ross
powell
shameless
lie
against
her
mrs
le
roy
too
had
declined
to
see
her
of
course
she
took
sides
with
her
son
the
poor
child
had
not
one
friend
to
turn
to
in
her
despair
her
heart
beat
her
face
burned
at
the
thought
of
the
ignominious
separation
her
husband
had
planned
what
did
she
care
for
eden
for
the
wealth
he
had
sneeringly
said
she
should
not
be
deprived
of
now
that
she
had
lost
him
all
the
latent
pride
within
her
rose
in
arms
against
such
terrible
humiliation
she
would
have
died
indeed
would
have
faced
the
crudest
death
unflinchingly
rather
than
have
remained
at
eden
on
such
terms
laurel
had
been
a
passionate
loving
impulsive
child
till
now
in
the
hour
of
her
unutterable
desolation
she
became
a
proud
cold
blighted
woman
her
sin
had
found
her
out
that
time
of
which
she
had
spoken
to
beatrix
wentworth
and
clarice
saying
that
only
when
it
came
could
she
repent
of
her
fault
had
come
and
metaphorically
speaking
she
wore
and
ashes
death
would
have
been
welcome
in
that
hour
she
longed
for
it
she
prayed
for
it
it
seemed
to
her
quite
impossible
that
she
could
lose
leon
and
live
she
had
told
herself
often
and
often
that
if
he
refused
to
forgive
her
when
he
found
her
out
she
should
die
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
her
heart
would
stop
its
beating
her
pulses
faint
and
fail
in
that
terrible
hour
but
the
end
had
come
and
the
blood
still
pulsed
through
her
veins
her
heart
still
beat
the
young
strong
life
that
thrilled
her
held
on
its
steady
course
a
great
temptation
came
over
her
as
she
crouched
in
the
night
and
the
darkness
on
the
banks
of
the
swirling
river
it
would
have
been
so
pleasant
so
sweet
to
have
ended
the
short
sad
story
of
her
life
with
its
terrible
temptation
and
cruel
failure
then
and
there
to
have
shut
out
the
dark
foreboding
future
in
the
merciful
shadows
of
oblivion
but
something
perhaps
that
tender
secret
she
had
so
shyly
withheld
from
her
husband
held
her
back
from
the
fatal
plunge
her
own
life
she
might
have
taken
in
the
frenzy
of
despair
but
that
other
tenderer
one
throbbing
beneath
her
broken
heart
she
could
not
she
dared
not
i
have
no
right
she
said
to
herself
i
might
be
wicked
and
mad
enough
to
commit
suicide
but
murder
never
no
no
i
will
be
brave
i
will
bear
my
cross
for
the
sake
of
what
is
coming
to
me
who
knows
but
that
it
may
comfort
me
in
my
lonely
future
leon
will
not
want
it
he
would
hate
it
and
exile
it
from
him
as
he
did
me
it
will
be
wholly
mine
something
of
his
that
will
love
me
and
cling
to
me
although
he
scorns
and
despises
me
so
she
went
away
she
took
with
her
none
of
the
jewels
none
of
the
beautiful
gifts
her
adoring
husband
had
lavished
upon
her
in
the
happy
days
now
forever
past
she
slipped
her
purse
into
her
pocket
it
contained
several
hundred
dollars
pride
would
have
made
her
leave
it
but
she
felt
that
for
the
sake
of
her
tender
secret
she
had
a
right
to
take
it
with
her
she
would
need
it
in
the
trial
that
lay
before
her
so
she
left
the
veil
and
gloves
upon
the
river
bank
where
they
would
find
them
if
they
sought
for
her
and
then
she
went
to
new
york
and
hid
herself
and
her
sorrow
in
the
obscurity
of
the
great
thronged
city
bearing
her
burden
of
sorrow
alone
and
in
pitiful
silence
and
despair
through
the
medium
of
the
omnipresent
newspaper
she
learned
of
the
tragedy
that
had
occurred
at
eden
as
if
it
had
been
the
story
of
another
she
went
over
the
fate
of
the
beautiful
impostor
who
had
been
detected
in
her
sin
and
whose
disappearance
had
been
followed
by
the
finding
of
her
drowned
body
then
indeed
she
started
wondering
who
the
unfortunate
river
waif
could
have
been
who
had
been
buried
with
the
honors
pertaining
to
leon
le
roy
young
wife
i
will
not
undeceive
them
she
said
now
indeed
i

him

laurel
did
not
find
it
easy
to
secure
respectable
lodgings
in
the
city
she
thought
of
returning
to
the
house
where
she
had
lived
with
her
father
but
a
wholesome
dread
of
her
base
enemy
ross
powell
held
her
back
she
did
not
think
it
would
be
prudent
to
venture
into
that
vicinity
so
she
went
to
a
portion
of
the
city
where
she
only
secured
the
cheap
and
decent
lodgings
she
desired
by
the
payment
of
several
months
in
advance
she
was
very
well
pleased
to
do
this
for
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
remain
in
this
quiet
obscure
locality
until
her
trial
was
over
to
her
curious
landlady
she
called
herself
vane
and
said
that
she
was
a
widow
as
she
had
left
all
her
clothing
at
eden
laurel
found
herself
compelled
to
draw
again
upon
her
small
hoard
of
money
in
accordance
with
her
of
a
widow
she
bought
only
black
dresses
and
these
of
a
cheap
and
simple
kind
she
put
back
her
rich
golden
hair
under
an
ugly
widow
cap
and
never
ventured
into
the
street
without
a
thick
crape
veil
drawn
closely
over
her
face
she
did
not
feel
that
she
was
acting
a
falsehood
in
doing
this
she
said
to
herself
that
she
was
worse
than
widowed
she
had
been
most
cruelly
put
away
from
her
husband
heart
for
a
sin
that
he
ought
to
have
forgiven
because
she
had
loved
him
so
dearly
and
had
been
tempted
so
much
beyond
her
power
of
resistance
a
strange
cold
bitterness
began
to
grow
up
in
her
desolate
young
heart
toward
him
she
called
him
hard
and
cold
and
unloving
in
her
thoughts
because
measured
by
her
own
passionate
love
his
affection
fell
so
far
below
the
standard
where
she
would
have
placed
it
laurel
was
all
unversed
in
the
lore
of
the
world
she
knew
nothing
of
the

ever
told
her
so
and
she
was
fated
to
learn
it
in
the
hardest
fashion
by
cruel
experience
she
was
learning
too
in
all
their
subtle
pathos
the
truth
of
those
mournful
lines

no

those
were
sad
and
heavy
days
that
followed
on
her
flitting
to
new
york
she
was
almost
crazed
with
the
bitterness
of
her
despair
there
were
weeks
that
were
afterward
almost
a
blank
to
her
because
she
spent
them
in
tears
that
were
like
drops
of
blood
wrung
from
her
aching
bleeding
heart
she
lay
all
day
on
her
little
bed
vainly
dwelling
on
the
irrevocable
past
looking
back
on
all
that
she
had
lost
with
incurable
longing
and
bitter
regret
when
this
season
of
lamenting
had
worn
itself
out
laurel
grew
hard
and
proud
and
tried
to
forget
a
hard
task
that
many
stronger
than
our
little
heroine
have
essayed
in
vain
after
awhile
she
found
out
that
she
would
have
to
draw
again
on
the
contents
of
her
already
diminished
purse
there
were
garments
to
be
provided
for
the
little
stranger
that
was
coming
to
brighten
her
darkened
life
she
would
not
choose
coarse
cheap
garments
now
such
as
she
had
bought
for
herself
she
selected
the
finest
whitest
linen
the
softest
warmest
flannel
the
daintiest
muslin
and
was
even
a
little
extravagant
in
the
matter
of
dainty
laces
and
hamburg
trimmings
then
when
the
complete
and
pretty
outfit
was
laid
away
with
lavender
and
between
the
snowy
folds
laurel
counted
the
few
dollars
that
were
left
from
her
expenditures
and
became
frightened
when
it
is
all
gone
what
shall
i
do
she
asked
herself
blankly
where
is
the
next
to
come
from
and
her
startled
reason
harshly
answered
her
you
will
have
to
work
for
it
you
will
have
to
earn
it
laurel
did
not
know
how
to
earn
money
she
had
never
been
taught
any
available
thing
and
her
delicate
condition
of
health
precluded
the
idea
of
going
out
into
the
busy
world
to
toil
besides
her
morbid
sensibilities
shrunk
from
the
thought
of
encountering
strangers
who
would
look
upon
her
with
coldness
perhaps
suspicion
she
was
in
despair
at
first
but
she
suddenly
remembered
how
easily
and
quickly
her
reckless
father
had
earned
the
wherewithal
for
their
support
the
publishers
were
always
eager
for
papa
she
said
to
herself
hopefully
and
being
his
daughter
i
must
have
inherited
his
genius
i
will
write
she
was
not
egotistical
she
was
simply
ignorant
of
the
world
ways
she
did
not
know
how
many
failed
in
the
world
of
letters
where
one
succeeded
the
idea
took
hold
of
her
fancy
and
without
a
dream
of
failure
she
armed
herself
with
a
ream
of
foolscap
plenty
of
ink
and
pens
and
went
enthusiastically
to
work

flies
apace
it
was
not
long
before
beatrix
wentworth
leisurely
reading
her
new
york
paper
in
london
came
upon
the
story
of
that
tragedy
on
the
beautiful
hudson
read
the
ending
of
the
strange
story
of
love
and
temptation
for
which
she
felt
herself
in
some
degree
responsible
since
she
herself
had
sent
laurel
vane
to
eden
she
threw
down
the
paper
and
wept
bitterly
it
was
true
that
she
had
been
angry
with
laurel
because
she
had
deceived
leon
le
roy
she
had
known
that
she
would
find
it
harder
to
be
forgiven
for
her
elopement
with
cyril
since
laurel
willful
marriage
but
in
this
moment
she
forgot
her
pique
her
annoyance
her
resentment
at
fault
and
her
heart
was
full
of
grief
and
pity
over
the
girl
sad
fate
she
remembered
how
young
and
fair
and
loving
the
erring
girl
had
been
and
she
said
to
herself
that
leon
le
roy
had
been
too
hard
and
cold
when
he
found
her
out
he
might
have
forgiven
her
he
should
have
been
kind
and
pitiful
to
her
at
least
for
the
sake
of
that
mad
love
that
had
tempted
her
to
sin
cyril
agreed
with
her
that
the
proud
rich
man
might
have
forgiven
the
lovely
hapless
girl
for
the
sake
of
her
great
love
he
had
felt
so
grateful
to
laurel
vane
for
the
service
she
had
done
him
and
beatrix
that
he
wished
her
the
greatest
good
and
the
greatest
happiness
that
is
possible
to
mortals
it
came
upon
him
with
a
great
shock
that
the
beautiful
girl
with
the
crimson
lips
like
a
pomegranate
flower
and
the
shining
golden
hair
was
dead
worse
than
all
dead
because
she
could
not
bear
her
life
driven
into
the
dark
cold
river
by
the
intensity
of
her
despair
he
wondered
what
mr
le
roy
feelings
could
be
i
should
feel
like
a
murderer
he
said
to
beatrix
it
would
seem
to
me
that
with
my
own
hand
i
had
pushed
the
poor
child
into
the
cruel
river
he
was
so
proud
all
my
life
i
have
heard
of
the
le
roy
pride
said
beatrix
i
have
felt
frightened
for
laurel
ever
since
i
found
out
what
she
had
done
i
never
doubted
that
he
would
put
her
away
from
him
when
he
found
her
out
but
i
never
dreamed
she
would
be
driven
to
suicide
i
thought
that
after
awhile
he
would
forgive
her
and
take
her
back
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
the
gentle
beautiful
girl
lying
dead
she
wept
when
she
recalled
her
first
meeting
with
her
and
the
temptation
that
had
entered
her
mind
how
sadly
their
girlish
conspiracy
had
ended
for
the
dead
author
daughter
i
was
her
evil
genius
but
i
only
meant
to
be
kind
to
her
she
repeated
remorsefully
many
times
even
clarice
who
had
been
very
angry
with
laurel
and
who
had
judged
her
hardly
at
first
had
nothing
but
tears
and
regrets
for
the
dead
girl
her
passionate
love
that
had
ended
in
so
sad
a
tragedy
set
her
apart
in
solemn
sacredness
she
had
atoned
for
her
fault
with
her
life
we
must
write
to
mr
le
roy
said
cyril
wentworth
we
must
confess
all
our
fault
in
sending
laurel
to
eden
we
must
tell
him
how
kind
and
true
and
sweet
she
was
until
her
mad
love
led
her
astray
we
must
beg
him
to
forgive
her
now
that
she
is
dead
beatrix
wrote
it
was
a
brave
though
most
pathetic
letter
she
owned
her
fault
in
sending
laurel
to
eden
she
dwelt
pathetically
on
her
temptation
to
do
so
she
begged
his
pardon
for
her
fault
and
then
she
pleaded
for
laurel
dead
as
warmly
and
earnestly
as
if
she
had
been
living
to
profit
by
the
prayers
of
her
friend
the
page
was
blistered
by
her
tears
but
no
answer
ever
came
to
her
earnest
appeal
it
seemed
that
mr
le
roy
was
indeed
hard
and
unforgiving
he
could
not
accord
his
pardon
to
any
of
the
actors
in
the
strange
drama
that
had
shadowed
his
life
then
beatrix
wrote
to
her
parents
humbly
acknowledging
her
fault
and
praying
their
pardon
she
loved
them
dearly
although
she
had
deserted
them
for
her
handsome
adoring
young
lover
she
had
a
faint
hope
that
they
would
forgive
her
and
cyril
and
bid
them
come
home
she
longed
for
her
father
kiss
of
welcome
her
mother
clasping
arms
oh
how
impatiently
she
waited
for
the
answer
to
that
letter
how
eagerly
she
longed
to
be
pardoned
for
the
girlish
conspiracy
that
had
ended
so
disastrously
to
laurel
vane
she
began
to
see
her
fault
in
a
darker
light
now
since
the
tragedy
at
eden
the
shadow
of
grave
seemed
to
fall
long
and
dark
across
her
wedded
happiness
an
answer
came
at
last
from
her
outraged
father
such
an
answer
as
withered
all
the
in
her
breast
they
would
never
forgive
her
for
her
fault
they
had
no
longer
a
daughter
their
beatrix
was
the
same
as
dead
to
them
and
they
wished
never
to
hear
from
cyril
wentworth
wife

leon
le

sat
alone
in
his
handsome
spacious
library
he
had
been
reading
but
the
book
of
poems
had
fallen
from
his
hand
and
he
was
dreamily
repeating
some
lines
that
had
touched
an
aching
chord
in
his
heart
i

so

and

if
i
might
memory
was
busy
at
his
heart
for
time
had
not
healed
it
had
only
seared
the
wound
of
years
ago
eight
years
had
come
and
gone
since
that
terrible
night
when
his
bitter
anger
and
hard
judgment
had
driven
his
erring
childish
wife
out
into
the
darkness
of
death
scarcely
an
hour
ago
he
had
stood
by
the
broken
marble
shaft
that
marked
her
grave
and
seen
the
gray
moss
creeping
over
the
sweet
simple
name
laurel
beloved
wife
of
leon
le
roy
yes
he
had
carved
it
on
her
tombstone
when
all
too
late
to
save
the
broken
heart
that
had
loved
him
with
a
madness
that
proved
its
own
destruction
beloved
ah
he
never
knew
how
well
until
the
slow
years
coming
and
going
barren
of
all
joy
had
shown
him
how
empty
and
hollow
was
all
the
world
measured
with
what
he
had
lost
all
his
life
was
a
long
regret
an
echo
of
the
poet
plaint
oh
to
call
back
the
days
that
are
not
the
years
had
marked
his
face
with
the
story
of
their
sadness
handsome
as
apollo
still
there
were
lines
of
pain
about
the
cold
proud
lids
there
were
silver
threads
clustering
in
the
raven
locks
tossed
carelessly
back
from
the
white
brow
there
were
shadows
always
lying
in
the
splendid
dark
eyes
for
years
he
had
been
a
lonely
wanderer
by
land
and
sea
but
now
that
he
had
come
home
again
to
eden
and
to
his
mother
and
to
laurel
grave
he
found
that
he
had
not
forgotten
that
he
never
could
forget
he
had
been
standing
by
her
grave
where
she
had
rested
for
eight
long
years
he
had
read
her
name
carved
on
the
cold
white
marble
but
back
here
in
the
room
where
he
had
wooed
her
for
his
wife
where
she
had
promised
to
be
his
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
not
make
her
dead
she
haunted
him
not
in
the
garments
dripping
like
cerement
in
which
she
had
been
drawn
from
her
watery
grave
but
bright
blushing
beautiful
as
in
those
days
forever
past
when
she
had
come
to
eden
first
and
made
herself
his
fate
his
fate
yes
it
had
come
to
that
the
one
woman
who
had
stirred
his
heart
to
its
deepest
depths
who
had
loved
him
so
blindly
and
deceived
him
so
terribly
had
made
herself
his
fate
he
had
not
forgotten
her
he
never
would
forget
he
remembered
the
dark
wistful
eyes
the
trembling
smile
of
the
crimson
lips
the
curling
golden
hair
the
warm
dimpled
white
hands
ah
only
to
clasp
them
again
only
to
kiss
the
lovely
responsive
lips
what
would
he
not
have
given
but
that
rose
is
not
anywhere
just
now
god
knows
where
all
the
old
sweetness
goes
if
only
i
had
forgiven
her
he
said
to
himself
as
he
had
said
it
over
and
over
in
the
long
weary
years
she
was
only
a
child
and
the
temptation
was
so
great
i
was
hard
and
cold
i
thought
only
of
myself
my
own
injuries
poor
little
loving
laurel
driven
to
her
death
by
my
hard
judgment
ah
that
my
sorrow
my
love
my
repentance
could
bring
her
back
he
bent
his
head
wearily
down
upon
his
folded
hands
heedless
of
the
light
gliding
step
that
came
to
his
side
the
soft
touch
that
fell
upon
his
hair
the
voice
that
breathed
in
loving
sympathy
my
son
it
was
his
mother
she
knew
where
he
had
been
and
her
heart
was
full
of
grief
and
sorrow
for
his
hopeless
pain
yet
she
knew
that
words
were
powerless
to
soothe
the
agony
of
remorse
and
pain
that
filled
his
heart
she
only
came
with
her
silent
sympathy
to
be
near
him
because
she
loved
him
and
shared
in
his
grief
he
looked
up
at
last
trying
to
seem
cheerful
for
her
sake
for
she
too
was
sadly
changed
by
the
progress
of
the
years
the
soft
waves
of
hair
that
clustered
on
her
brow
had
grown
snowy
white
the
patrician
face
was
pale
and
sad
her
voice
had
always
a
tone
of
unconscious
pathos
in
its
low
clear
modulations
i
am
sorry
you
have
found
me
thus
mother
he
said
seeing
the
sorrowful
tears
shining
in
her
gentle
eyes
years
should
have
taught
me
to
be
brave
and
strong
but
you
know
where
i
have
been
it
brought
the
past
all
back
and
temporarily
unnerved
me
yes
i
know
but
you
will
feel
better
by
and
by
she
said
simply
feeling
that
silence
was
better
than
words
before
such
grief
as
his
it
was
a
subject
on
which
they
never
conversed
she
had
felt
it
was
a
cruel
and
unkind
act
when
she
first
learned
of
the
interview
that
leon
had
refused
to
allow
between
her
and
laurel
that
tragic
night
she
had
reproached
him
most
bitterly
for
it
once
but
ever
since
she
had
held
her
peace
there
was
that
in
his
face
when
she
looked
at
him
that
told
of
a
conscience
never
at
rest
of
a
heart
whose
were
harder
to
bear
than
words
of
hers
could
have
been
she
grew
to
be
sorry
for
him
and
never
by
word
or
sign
added
to
his
pain
for
the
proud
lonely
disappointed
old
woman
idolized
her
stately
son
even
yet
although
by
his
hard
unforgiving
course
toward
laurel
vane
he
had
shattered
the
dearest
hope
of
her
life
that
hope
that
longing
for
an
heir
to
eden
for
another
le
roy
to
rule
and
reign
at
the
grand
old
home
on
the
hudson
when
she
and
leon
should
have
passed
away
was
long
since
dead
she
had
ceased
even
to
hope
that
her
son
would
ever
marry
again
she
saw
how
coldly
and
carelessly
he
turned
from
the
fair
faces
that
smiled
upon
him
how
restless
and
impatient
he
was
under
the
requirements
of
society
when
he
died
their
fine
estates
their
vast
wealth
would
have
to
pass
to
distant
relations
mere
strangers
bearing
another
name
it
was
hard
it
hurt
her
pride
cruelly
but
she
said
nothing
to
leon
she
kept
her
tears
and
her
bitter
lamentations
for
that
quiet
grave
where
the
unfulfilled
hope
of
her
life
lay
buried
in
darkness
forever
for
the
sake
of
that
hope
she
had
been
willing
to
forgive
laurel
deceit
and
duplicity
she
would
have
forgiven
even
more
for
the
sake
of
holding
her
grandchild
in
her
arms
it
was
too
late
now
leon
would
never
marry
would
never
forget
with
a
smothered
sigh
she
tried
to
put
the
vexing
thought
out
of
her
mind
and
with
the
same
laudable
intent
toward
leon
she
roused
herself
and
said
quietly
i
do
not
believe
i
have
told
you
yet
leon
that
we
have
new
neighbors
at
belle
vue
belle
vue
was
the
country
house
next
to
them
and
one
almost
as
beautiful
as
eden
it
was
scarcely
a
mile
away
and
leon
looked
up
with
some
little
interest
as
he
inquired
what
have
the
armisteads
sold
out
or
gone
away
both
robert
armistead
failed
in
his
banking
business
and
it
involved
the
loss
of
his
whole
private
fortune
he
sold
out
everything
and
went
west
with
his
family
to
seek
his
fortune
again
i
am
sorry
for
armistead
said
leon
le
roy
in
that
vague
conventional
tone
in
which
one
is
usually
sorry
for
the
misfortunes
that
do
not
touch
himself
and
so
there
are
new
people
at
belle
vue
yes
they
have
been
down
about
a
month
are
they
new
rich
people
leon
asked
with
some
little
disdain
indeed
i
do
not
know
i
should
say
not
however
said
his
mother
people
have
taken
them
up
very
sociably
there
is
an
old
gentleman
a
ford
quite
a
traveled
man
i
am
told
his
niece
lives
with
him
and
her
son
she
is
a
widow
and
literary
what
has
she
written
he
inquires
with
faint
interest
several
novels
curse
of
gold
and
some
others
gordon
is
her
new
york
publisher
but
i
think
she
has
been
in
europe
lately
with
mr
ford
some
little
excitement
gleams
in
his
eyes
the
author
of
our
nearest
neighbor
he
exclaims
why
mother
did
you
know
that
her
books
have
made
quite
a
stir
abroad
as
well
as
at
home
they
are
quite
the
fashion
i
am
sure
i
liked
them
myself
the
style
is
very
fresh
and
pure
do
you
think
we
ought
to
call
at
belle
vue
leon
i
have
been
thinking
that
it
is
my
duty
to
do
so
perhaps
it
is
i
will
go
with
you
if
you
wish
some
day
i
am
just
a
little
curious
over
the
but
i
dare
say
she
is
old
and
wears
caps
and
spectacles
he
answers
carelessly
enough
chapter
xlviii
laurie
laurie
come
and
carry
my
flowers
for
me
called
a
voice
it
was
sweet
and
clear
as
a
chime
of
silver
bells
but
it
pierced
leon
le
roy
heart
like
a
it
thrilled
and
quivered
through
him
stirring
him
with
a
blended
joy
and
pain
he
listened
and
again
the
sweet
voice
cried
come
my
son
mamma
is
waiting
for
you
they
were
calling
at
belle
vue
leon
and
his
mother
ford
had
entertained
them
graciously
in
the
splendid
blue
and
gold
but
lynn
could
not
be
found
she
must
be
out
walking
said
her
uncle
disappointedly
and
after
awhile
he
invited
them
to
come
out
into
the
she
might
be
there
he
said
it
was
a
favorite
haunt
of
hers
so
in
the
freshness
and
beauty
of
the
july
morning
they
went
out
into
the
graveled
paths
lying
whitely
in
the
sunshine
forming
such
an
exquisite
contrast
to
the
green
grass
and
the
beds
of
glorious
roses
with
the
morning
dew
still
shining
on
their
bright
petals
and
while
they
walked
that
voice
came
to
leon
like
an
echo
from
the
buried
past
dead
and
buried
for
eight
long
years
she
is
here
i
will
bring
her
to
you
ford
says
nervously
starting
away
from
them
and
they
pause
by
a
little
crystal
fountain
throwing
up
diamond
spray
into
the
clear
bright
air
and
wait
leon
with
his
heart
beating
strangely
thrilled
to
blended
ecstasy
and
despair
by
a
voice
her
voice
is
like
mrs
le
roy
begins
then
shuts
her
lips
over
the
unspoken
name
vexed
with
herself
that
she
was
about
to
sadden
the
tenor
of
her
idol
thoughts
let
us
walk
on
a
little
further
she
amends
abruptly
and
a
few
more
steps
bring
them
upon
a
picture
ford
has
found
his
niece
he
is
standing
talking
to
her
earnestly
making
no
move
to
return
to
his
guests
perhaps
he
is
explaining
to
her
the
fact
of
their
presence
am
i
going
mad
leon
asks
himself
with
stern
set
lips
and
wildly
staring
eyes
she
is
not
of
us
as
i
divine
she
comes
from
another
stiller
world
of
the
dead
the
tide
of
years
rolls
backward
he
has
forgotten
lynn
the
authoress
as
if
she
had
never
been
this
slender
stately
woman
with
her
white
hand
resting
lightly
on
ford
arm
is
a
ghost
from
the
past
the
dark
uplifted
eyes
the
tender
crimson
mouth
the
waving
golden
hair
are
like
hers
whom
for
a
little
while
he
believed
to
be
an
angel
but
finding
her
only
a
faulty
mortal
he
had
sternly
put
away
from
him
so
like
so
like
that
he
can
not
take
his
eyes
from
the
form
with
the
wide
tilted
carelessly
back
from
the
low
white
brow
with
its
clustering
waves
of
sunny
hair
and
the
white
hands
full
of
roses
most
of
them
dewy
crimson
as
if
she
loved
that
color
best
while
he
gazes
like
one
stupefied
they
turn
and
walk
toward
him
leon
is
conscious
of
a
little
admonitory
pinch
administered
by
his
mother
slim
fingers
and
tries
to
rouse
himself
to
the
occasion
in
a
minute
he
is
conscious
of
a
lamentable
failure
as
he
meets
dark
eyes
upturned
to
his
in
calm
surprise
she
is
by
far
the
cooler
and
calmer
of
the
two
and
directly
he
finds
himself
walking
by
her
side
along
the
graveled
path
the
elder
couple
pacing
sedately
after
them
he
is
aware
that
he
has
not
distinguished
himself
in
this
meeting
with
the
gifted
authoress
his
words
have
been
few
and
incoherent
not
worthy
of
leon
le
roy
he
rallies
himself
with
a
desperate
effort
and
makes
the
first
remark
that
comes
into
his
head
you
like
flowers
mrs
lynn
is
the
hackneyed
observation
i
love
them
she
answers
quickly
and
he
is
instantly
reminded
of
another
who
loved
not
liked
the
fragrant
dewy
darlings
you
see
i
have
gathered
almost
more
than
i
can
carry
she
goes
on
looking
lovingly
at
the
great
bunch
in
her
hands
i
called
my
son
laurie
to
help
me
but
he
is
chasing
a
butterfly
i
dare
say
and
out
of
sound
of
my
voice
permit
me
he
says
taking
them
courteously
from
her
and
at
the
unavoidable
touch
of
their
hands
a
hot
crimson
flush
mounts
to
his
brow
his
heart
beats
painfully
i
must
go
away
from
here
presently
he
says
to
himself
impatiently
i
have
no
at
all
what
a
ninny
lynn
must
believe
me
and
yet
and
yet
she
is
so
like
a
ghost
from
my
dead
past
that
i
lose
my
senses
looking
on
her
perfect
face
we
have
some
very
rare
flowers
at
eden
he
says
i
hope
you
will
come
and
see
them
since
you
are
so
fond
of
them
you
shall
carry
away
all
you
like
thank
you
i
shall
be
sure
to
come
she
answers
i
know
i
have
heard
i
mean
that
the
flowers
at
eden
are
wonderful
i
hope
they
will
justify
your
expectations
he
says
shall
we
sit
down
here
and
rest
lynn
you
must
be
tired
they
sit
down
on
a
rustic
bench
side
by
side
and
the
elderly
couple
follow
suit
at
some
little
distance
it
is
a
lovely
morning
and
a
lovely
scene
the
golden
sunshine
sifts
down
through
leafy
boughs
all
about
them
the
air
is
sweet
with
the
song
of
birds
and
the
breath
of
flowers
the
blue
waves
of
the
hudson
are
visible
at
some
little
distance
lending
additional
beauty
to
the
charming
scene
lynn
looks
away
at
the
river
and
leon
looks
at
her
trying
to
convince
himself
that
her
likeness
to
the
dead
is
not
so
great
as
he
had
fancied
laurel
was
a
girl
this
is
a
woman
he
tells
himself
he
is
right
lynn
is
very
young
but
the
sweet
gravity
the
exquisite
majesty
of
womanhood
are
stamped
on
her
pure
white
brow
thought
intellect
experience
are
blended
with
her
still
youthful
beauty
in
charming
combination
laurel
had
been
a
beautiful
rosebud
lynn
was
a
perfect
rose
and
yet
he
said
to
himself
laurel
at
would
have
been
lynn
counterpart
while
she
looked
dreamily
off
at
the
river
with
those
dark
heavily
fringed
eyes
and
he
looked
at
her
a
silence
fell
between
them
it
was
broken
by
the
laughter
of
a
child
a
beautiful
boy
came
running
down
the
path
toward
them
and
stopped
at
his
mother
knee
oh
mamma
i
am
so
tired
he
panted
breathlessly
his
rosy
lips
parted
with
happy
laughter
and
i
did
not
catch
my
beautiful
butterfly
after
all
the
lovely
young
mother
turned
toward
her
child
her
cheek
was
very
pale
there
was
a
strange
light
in
her
dark
eyes
laurie
do
you
not
see
the
gentleman
she
said
go
and
speak
to
him
mr
le
roy
this
is
my
son
laurence
he
did
not
blame
her
for
the
sweet
ring
of
triumph
in
her
voice
the
boy
was
as
handsome
and
spirited
as
a
little
prince
he
had
great
flashing
dark
eyes
and
clustering
dark
hair
combined
with
perfect
features
at
once
proud
and
gentle
his
beautiful
rosy
lips
seemed
made
for
smiles
and
kisses
his
dark
blue
velvet
suit
set
off
his
fine
spirited
little
figure
to
the
greatest
perfection
mr
le
roy
drew
the
manly
little
fellow
to
his
side
i
am
very
glad
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
so
important
a
person
as
lynn
son
he
said
how
old
are
you
master
laurence
almost
eight
said
the
little
lad
and
his
mother
amended
in
a
low
voice
that
had
somehow
a
strange
quiver
in
its
sweetness
seven
and
a
half
mr
le
roy
then
in
a
sadder
cadence
the
only
son
of
his
mother
and
she
is
a
widow
i
have
no
papa
mr
le
roy
said
the
manly
little
fellow
in
a
tone
of
regret
other
boys
have
fine
times
with
their
papas
they
tell
me
but
i
do
not
even
remember
mine
he
died
before
i
was
born
do
not
weary
the
gentleman
with
a
recital
of
your
family
history
my
dear
interposed
his
mother
gently
go
now
and
speak
to
the
lady
who
is
sitting
with
uncle
carlyle
the
child
went
away
followed
by
mr
le
roy
glance
he
could
not
understand
the
strange
yearning
that
drew
him
to
the
princely
little
lad
i
have
fancied
you
must
be
very
proud
of
the
books
you
have
written
lynn
he
said
impulsively
i
can
fancy
that
you
are
prouder
still
of
your
son
i
am
she
answered
in
a
voice
full
of
love
and
pride
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
love
my
boy
mr
le
roy
it
seems
to
me
that
he
is
the
most
beautiful
the
most
intelligent
the
most
loving
lad
in
the
world
do
you
blame
me
suddenly
lifting
her
dark
grave
eyes
to
his
face
should
not
you
be
proud
of
such
a
son
mr
le
roy
no
i
do
not
blame
you
he
answered
i
am
quite
sure
i
should
be
proud
of
such
a
fine
little
son
and
a
thrill
of
sorrow
and
went
through
him
as
he
recalled
the
words
his
mother
had
spoken
to
him
eight
long
years
ago
in
a
little
while
there
would
have
been
an
heir
to
eden
a
buried
hope
ah
if
only
he
had
been
a
little
less
hard
and
cold
if
only
laurel
had
told
him
her
precious
secret
he
must
have
forgiven
her
then
he
could
not
have
withheld
his
pardon
there
was
something
in
lynn
tone
he
could
not
understand
was
it
a
taunt
at
his
childlessness
or
was
it
only
a
mother
triumph
in
her
treasure
he
looked
at
the
beautiful
face
it
was
faintly
flushed
the
drooping
lashes
were
dewy
with
unfallen
tears
some
deep
emotion
stirred
her
heart
and
made
roses
on
her
breast
rise
and
fall
with
its
intensity
while
he
puzzled
over
it
there
came
a
startled
cry
from
ford
mrs
le
roy
had
fallen
from
her
seat
in
a
dead
faint
leon
hastened
to
her
they
raised
her
up
but
it
was
some
little
time
before
she
recovered
none
could
understand
what
had
caused
her
swoon
she
was
sitting
with
laurie
on
her
knee
talking
very
brightly
and
pleasantly
and
quite
suddenly
all
at
once
as
it
were
her
arms
dropped
from
around
the
child
and
she
fell
like
one
dead
said
ford
i
can
not
understand
it
has
your
mother
any
heart
disease
mr
le
roy
none
but
she
is
not
very
strong
leon
answered
she
very
seldom
goes
out
then
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
take
me
home
leon
she
said
i
am
very
tired
lynn
pressed
her
cordially
to
remain
at
belle
vue
until
she
was
better
no
i
can
not
stay
now
mrs
le
roy
answered
gravely
but
you
will
pardon
my
display
of
weakness
lynn
and
you
will
come
to
see
me
soon
will
you
not
lynn
promised
with
a
smile
that
she
would
certainly
accept
the
invitation
and
the
child
you
will
be
sure
to
bring
him
said
mrs
le
roy
kissing
the
wondering
little
face
if
you
wish
it
assented
the
beautiful
young
authoress
and
her
face
grew
paler
still
when
mrs
le
roy
impulsively
kissed
her
cheek
leon
wondered
why
her
small
hand
was
so
cold
as
he
pressed
it
lightly
at
parting
he
would
have
wondered
yet
more
could
he
have
seen
the
white
agonized
face
she
turned
upon
ford
when
they
had
gone
away
chapter
xlix
carlyle
ford
went
up
to
the
beautiful
woman
and
took
her
cold
trembling
hands
gently
in
his
she
was
as
pale
as
death
and
she
shivered
as
if
an
icy
wave
had
broken
over
her
my
dear
this
has
been
too
much
for
you
he
said
i
see
now
that
we
should
never
have
come
here
lynn
did
not
answer
she
only
drew
her
white
hands
from
his
and
sinking
down
covered
her
face
with
them
she
remained
thus
some
minutes
and
her
uncle
saw
that
the
bright
tears
were
raining
through
her
fingers
and
her
graceful
figure
heaving
with
deep
emotion
the
child
had
returned
to
his
sport
with
the
butterflies
and
flowers
as
soon
as
the
visitors
departed
they
were
alone
and
in
a
little
while
lynn
looked
up
and
brushed
the
tears
from
her
beautiful
face
perhaps
you
are
right
she
said
it
may
be
that
i
was
wrong
to
meet
him
at
all
but
i
had
the
greatest
longing
to
see
him
after
all
these
years
and
after
all
i
was
no
coward
uncle
carlyle
i
did
not
break
down
before
i
was
calm
and
proud
he
did
not
dream
that
i
was
other
than
i
seemed
no
you
played
your
part
well
he
said
i
was
delighted
with
your
dignity
and
grace
mr
le
roy
was
the
more
agitated
of
the
two
he
was
struck
by
the
resemblance
he
showed
deep
though
repressed
emotion
i
think
you
give
him
credit
for
too
much
feeling
cried
lynn
with
a
scornful
flash
in
her
dark
eyes
he
has
forgotten
long
ago
perhaps
so
said
ford
yet
i
am
inclined
to
think
otherwise
and
the
lady
she
could
not
keep
her
eyes
off
you
and
the
child
she
could
not
help
seeing
the
likeness
between
her
son
and
your
son
i
am
sure
it
was
startling
the
boy
is
much
more
like
mr
le
roy
than
he
is
like
you
the
same
hair
and
eyes
the
same
proud
features
only
he
has
your
beautiful
tender
mouth
why
did
the
lady
faint
i
can
not
tell
lynn
answered
drearily
i
think
she
was
unnerved
by
the
resemblance
it
brought
back
the
past
too
vividly
my
darling
they
have
not
forgotten
as
you
think
i
foresee
a
reconciliation
he
said
never
cried
lynn
with
curling
lips
and
flashing
eyes
i
may
be
weak
enough
to
care
for
him
still
but
i
can
never
forget
and
i
will
never
return
to
him
i
am
a
child
no
longer
i
am
a
woman
and
my
pride
is
equal
to
his
own
the
handsome
kindly
face
of
old
ford
looked
grave
and
puzzled
my
dear
is
it
right
to
cherish
such
pride
he
asked
slowly
were
it
not
better
to
condone
the
past
to
forgive
and
forget
are
you
right
to
keep
the
heir
of
eden
from
his
own
uncle
carlyle
are
you
anxious
to
get
rid
of
me
asked
the
lovely
gifted
woman
wistfully
no
no
dear
what
should
i
do
without
you
and
the
boy
he
cried
but
i
do
not
want
to
be
selfish
i
do
not
want
to
keep
leon
le
roy
happiness
from
him
the
warm
color
flashed
into
her
cheeks
she
laughed
bitterly
his
happiness
she
cried
his
happiness
in
his
pride
and
cruelty
he
threw
it
away
he
is
as
proud
and
cold
now
as
he
was
then
he
would
take
me
back
no
sooner
now
than
he
would
then
but
why
do
we
talk
of
these
things
he
will
never
have
the
chance
he
will
never
know
the
truth
they
have
raised
a
costly
monument
to
leon
le
roy
for
them
that
is
the
end
eight
years
he
said
musingly
at
least
he
has
been
faithful
to
her
memory
it
is
strange
that
he
has
not
married
again
if
not
for
love
at
least
for
the
sake
of
an
heir
she
caught
her
breath
sharply
her
lovely
face
grew
deathly
white
married
married
she
cried
sharply
why
do
you
talk
of
such
things
uncle
carlyle
i
did
not
mean
to
pain
you
laurel
he
answered
but
my
dear
it
seems
so
strange
le
roy
has
a
princely
estate
and
fine
old
name
it
would
be
only
natural
if
he
should
wish
to
leave
it
to
his
own
descendants
so
he
shall
she
said
when
i
am
dead
he
shall
have
laurie
i
have
everything
arranged
in
the
clearest
fashion
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
proving
his
identity
but
uncle
carlyle
do
not
let
us
talk
of
these
things
they
hurt
me
you
want
to
be
alone
he
said
very
well
dear
i
will
go
and
play
with
my
boy
forgive
me
for
saying
those
things
that
hurt
you
i
did
not
mean
to
do
so
he
went
away
and
laurel
sunk
down
wearily
her
hands
clinched
tightly
together
a
look
of
woe
and
dread
on
her
lovely
face
married
again
she
uttered
hoarsely
well
and
if
he
should
what
is
there
to
prevent
him
could
i
speak
would
i
speak
no
and
yet
ah
heaven
the
fatal
glamour
is
on
me
still
it
is
a
mad
love
nothing
less
the
wind
sighed
in
the
trees
the
murmur
of
the
river
came
to
her
softly
the
sweet
calm
day
seemed
to
woo
her
to
forgetfulness
but
the
beautiful
woman
who
had
won
fame
and
wealth
and
honor
in
those
long
years
since
she
had
been
put
away
from
her
husband
heart
sat
silent
with
a
look
of
mute
despair
on
her
fair
young
face
that
mad
love
that
terrible
temptation
of
her
girlhood
had
spoiled
her
life
it
is
a
mad
love
she
repeated
to
herself
how
my
face
burned
and
my
heart
beat
when
i
met
him
all
the
old
madness
surged
up
within
me
the
love
the
sorrow
the
shame
at
my
deceit
it
is
a
wonder
i
did
not
fall
down
dead
at
his
feet
no
one
ever
loved
more
deeply
than
i
loved
leon
le
roy
she
went
on
after
a
pause
if
he
had
forgiven
me
my
fault
that
night
when
he
had
found
me
out
i
should
have
been
the
happiest
woman
in
the
world
instead
of
being
the
most
wretched
as
i
am
ah
why
did
i
ever
come
back
here
it
was
a
blind
mistake
it
has
reopened
the
old
wound
and
it
is
bleeding
bleeding
ah
heaven
shall
i
never
learn
indifference
shall
i
never
sear
my
cureless
wound
i
must
go
away
soon
i
was
weak
and
wild
ever
to
have
come
here
with
uncle
carlyle
chapter
leon
le
roy
and
his
mother
had
a
very
quiet
drive
homeward
both
were
busy
with
their
own
thoughts
the
lady
leaned
back
against
the
cushions
of
the
phaeton
with
closed
eyes
and
a
look
of
grave
thought
on
her
pale
wan
features
leon
with
his
calm
dark
eyes
and
sternly
set
lips
was
as
much
absorbed
as
she
was
in
grave
and
earnest
thought
he
sat
very
quietly
holding
the
reins
and
neither
spoke
until
they
had
reached
home
then
when
they
were
sitting
together
leon
with
an
open
book
before
him
her
keen
eyes
noted
that
he
had
not
turned
a
page
for
half
an
hour
and
she
spoke
abruptly
leon
what
do
you
think
of
the
famous
authoress
his
head
drooped
still
lower
over
his
book
as
he
answered
quietly
she
is
very
beautiful
and
brilliant
i
had
not
expected
to
find
her
so
young
and
fair
she
is
the
loveliest
woman
i
ever
saw
said
mrs
le
roy
yes
he
answered
simply
in
his
gravely
quiet
tone
he
did
not
care
to
talk
he
was
like
one
in
a
strange
dream
his
soul
had
been
shaken
and
stirred
to
its
depths
by
the
beautiful
woman
who
had
flashed
before
him
with
his
dead
wife
face
and
voice
and
the
crimson
roses
in
her
hands
such
as
laurel
had
loved
to
gather
the
tide
of
time
rolled
backward
and
in
place
of
the
proud
calm
woman
the
gifted
genius
before
whom
he
had
bowed
came
a
vision
of
a
simple
girl
wandering
through
the
grounds
at
eden
flitting
among
the
fragrant
flowers
herself
the
fairest
rose
of
all
did
she
love
him
that
beautiful
impostor
leon
le
roy
asked
himself
as
he
had
done
many
times
before
in
the
eight
years
while
that
marble
cross
had
towered
above
the
dead
heart
whose
secret
now
would
never
be
told
did
she
love
him
indeed
had
she
sinned
through
her
love
not
for
wealth
and
position
as
he
had
believed
that
terrible
night
and
there
came
back
to
him
through
the
mist
of
years
the
memory
of
that
beautiful
tearful
face
and
the
pleading
voice
ah
if
only
i
had
forgiven
her
he
said
to
himself
in
an
agony
of
remorse
and
regret
she
loved
me
i
was
mad
to
doubt
it
save
for
her
one
fault
her
one
deception
laurel
vane
was
pure
and
true
and
innocent
i
was
hard
and
cold
few
men
but
would
have
forgiven
her
such
a
transgression
for
love
sake
his
face
fell
forward
on
the
open
pages
of
the
book
where
he
had
been
reading
drearily
enough
some
mournful
lines
that
seemed
to
fit
his
mood
glitters
the
dew
and
shines
the
river
up
comes
the
lily
and
dries
her
bell
but
two
are
walking
apart
forever
and
wave
their
hands
for
a
mute
farewell
a
light
touch
fell
on
the
bowed
head
whose
raven
locks
were
threaded
with
silver
that
grief
not
time
had
blanched
he
glanced
up
startled
into
his
mother
wistful
face
well
he
said
with
a
slight
contraction
of
his
straight
dark
brows
there
was
a
strange
repressed
emotion
in
her
face
as
she
answered
it
is
not
leon
you
are
unnerved
troubled
thoughtful
even
beyond
your
wont
will
you
forgive
me
for
asking
why
the
dark
inscrutable
eyes
looked
at
her
gravely
i
might
turn
your
deeds
upon
yourself
he
said
why
did
you
faint
in
the
garden
at
belle
vue
she
flushed
and
then
grew
very
pale
again
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
she
said
or
a
part
of
it
at
least
i
was
unnerved
and
startled
by
the
terrible
resemblance
of
the
beautiful
lynn
to
my
lost
wife
he
said
slowly
filling
up
her
painful
pause
so
you
noticed
it
she
said
could
one
help
it
he
asked
in
his
slow
repressed
voice
why
do
you
call
it
a
terrible
resemblance
mother
she
is
so
like
so
like
she
is
the
living
image
of
what
laurel
must
have
been
now
if
she
lived
and
the
child
leon
the
child
she
broke
down
suddenly
and
burst
into
wild
hysterical
sobbing
shocked
by
the
passionate
grief
so
unusual
in
his
stately
he
drew
his
arm
tenderly
around
her
and
led
her
to
a
seat
kneeling
down
humbly
before
her
mother
does
the
old
wound
still
ache
so
bitterly
he
said
in
blended
pity
and
remorse
i
had
thought
the
pain
of
it
was
past
ah
i
can
never
forgive
myself
for
the
madness
the
cruelty
that
robbed
you
of
the
daughter
you
loved
and
the
grandchild
i
expected
she
sobbed
bitterly
ah
leon
i
can
never
forget
how
my
hopes
were
blasted
forgive
me
for
those
weak
tears
my
son
all
the
old
regret
and
sorrow
were
stirred
anew
in
my
heart
by
the
sight
of
lynn
and
her
beautiful
child
he
had
no
answer
for
her
he
was
too
proud
and
reserved
to
tell
his
mother
the
truth
that
he
too
had
been
shaken
by
a
ghost
from
the
past
that
day
he
knelt
by
her
silently
letting
her
sob
out
all
her
grief
and
sorrow
against
his
shoulder
and
when
she
had
grown
calmer
he
said
gently
mother
dear
you
must
not
see
this
lynn
again
it
agitates
you
too
much
after
all
it
is
only
a
resemblance
she
might
not
feel
flattered
if
she
knew
that
we
compared
her
with
my
simple
little
dead
so
long
ago
let
me
take
you
away
to
the
seashore
or
the
mountains
while
lynn
remains
at
belle
vue
but
she
negatived
the
proposition
in
extreme
alarm
it
could
only
afford
me
pleasure
to
see
lynn
again
she
declared
i
love
her
for
her
likeness
to
the
dead
i
am
unwilling
to
lose
a
single
chance
of
seeing
her
and
i
promise
you
leon
that
i
will
not
lose
my
again
as
i
did
in
the
first
shock
of
meeting
her
i
will
be
as
calm
and
cold
as
she
is
chapter
li
a
few
days
later
ford
brought
his
niece
and
her
son
to
call
at
eden
the
brilliant
writer
looked
very
elegant
and
distinguished
in
her
dress
of
soft
rich
black
silk
and
lace
a
dainty
bonnet
of
black
lace
and
gleaming
jet
rested
on
the
dark
golden
waves
of
her
hair
and
set
off
to
the
greatest
advantage
her
blonde
loveliness
lighted
by
such
dark
and
eyes
a
soft
color
glowed
on
her
rounded
cheeks
and
her
eyes
were
bright
with
repressed
excitement
but
no
trace
of
her
heart
emotion
showed
in
her
calm
gracious
manner
as
she
bowed
to
her
handsome
host
and
greeted
his
stately
mother
she
had
schooled
herself
to
calmness
and
no
heartless
queen
of
society
ever
bore
herself
with
more
ease
and
outward
coldness
than
did
laurel
in
the
hour
when
she
the
home
she
had
left
long
years
before
a
wretched
despairing
child
for
whom
life
seemed
over
and
done
now
as
she
stepped
across
the
threshold
a
beautiful
proud
successful
woman
whom
the
world
delighted
to
honor
she
remembered
that
child
with
a
pang
of
bitterness
that
steeled
her
heart
to
the
softness
that
had
melted
it
for
a
moment
she
be
cold
and
calm
for
the
sake
of
the
girl
so
cruelly
put
away
from
her
husband
heart
so
cruelly
misjudged
and
scorned
yet
as
it
all
rushed
over
her
again
she
wondered
as
she
had
wondered
over
and
over
in
the
past
how
she
had
lived
through
her
sorrow
that
sorrow
which
she
had
said
so
many
times
would
kill
her
when
it
came
the
day
drags
through
though
storms
keep
out
the
sun
and
thus
the
heart
will
break
yet
brokenly
live
on
she
said
the
pathetic
lines
over
to
herself
wearily
even
as
she
touched
leon
hand
with
her
own
and
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
a
smile
bright
but
cold
like
moonlight
on
snow
he
had
no
answering
smile
in
return
his
face
was
almost
stern
in
its
marble
pallor
and
intensity
of
repressed
emotion
his
firm
white
hand
was
cold
as
ice
as
it
touched
the
rosy
palm
so
graciously
extended
his
voice
had
a
strange
tone
even
to
himself
as
he
welcomed
her
to
his
home
you
have
the
most
beautiful
home
on
the
hudson
eden
is
far
more
beautiful
than
belle
vue
she
said
to
him
with
her
bright
cold
smile
i
am
glad
you
like
my
home
it
will
always
have
an
added
charm
in
my
eyes
since
lynn
has
deigned
to
praise
it
leon
answered
gallantly
she
thanked
him
almost
mockingly
and
then
their
conversation
turned
upon
the
safe
ground
of
generalities
upon
art
and
books
and
foreign
travel
where
both
were
at
home
he
found
lynn
his
equal
in
every
sense
her
mind
was
rarely
cultured
and
stored
with
knowledge
her
thoughts
were
beautiful
and
crystal
clear
she
held
her
own
with
the
ease
and
grace
of
one
who
knew
the
world
yet
retained
the
native
innocence
and
frankness
of
a
child
leon
hauteur
and
reserve
melted
before
the
charm
of
her
manner
and
he
became
his
natural
self
again
meeting
her
on
her
own
ground
with
polished
words
and
brilliant
thoughts
their
glances
met
each
other
calmly
telling
no
tales
of
that
auld
lang
syne
when
eyes
looked
love
to
eyes
that
spake
again
two
maskers
what
had
they
to
do
with
vows
forsworn
and
loves
untrue
mrs
le
roy
gave
her
attention
to
ford
and
the
child
she
had
drawn
little
laurence
to
a
seat
by
her
side
and
was
showing
him
some
fine
engravings
she
could
not
keep
her
fascinated
eyes
from
the
beautiful
spirited
boyish
face
that
bore
such
a
startling
resemblance
to
that
of
her
own
son
ford
watched
her
closely
and
he
saw
that
her
heart
had
gone
out
to
the
child
and
that
she
was
trying
to
win
his
love
in
return
he
looked
on
approvingly
longing
in
the
depths
of
his
unselfish
heart
for
a
reconciliation
between
the
husband
and
wife
neither
one
is
happy
he
said
to
himself
looking
at
them
as
they
sat
talking
calmly
like
strangers
the
proud
husband
and
the
proud
wife
that
man
has
a
story
written
on
his
face
he
has
suffered
intensely
is
it
possible
he
does
not
suspect
the
truth
can
he
look
at
her
speak
to
her
and
not
recognize
her
it
almost
seems
impossible
there
was
never
beauty
before
like
hers
never
such
winsomeness
and
artless
grace
before
i
came
here
i
despised
leon
le
roy
why
is
it
that
i
pity
him
now
is
it
because
i
can
read
his
sorrow
and
repentance
in
the
sadness
of
his
face
mr
le
roy
rising
at
that
moment
said
quietly
looking
at
his
mother
i
am
taking
lynn
to
the
library
mother
to
show
her
a
book
we
have
been
discussing
if
you
and
ford
will
excuse
us
certainly
both
answered
in
a
breath
and
they
went
away
followed
by
mrs
le
roy
startled
glance
your
niece
is
very
beautiful
she
said
turning
back
after
a
moment
to
ford
has
she
been
long
a
widow
seven
years
he
answered
then
the
child
has
never
known
his
father
she
said
with
a
light
pitying
touch
of
her
ringed
white
hand
on
the
boy
dark
clustering
curls
no
much
to
the
lad
regret
said
ford
i
dare
say
you
have
acted
a
father
part
by
the
fatherless
one
she
remarked
turning
her
grave
questioning
eyes
on
his
face
it
seemed
as
if
she
was
fascinated
to
speak
of
little
laurence
she
could
not
keep
her
eyes
nor
her
thoughts
from
him
since
i
have
known
him
yes
ford
answered
but
though
his
mother
is
my
own
sister
child
mrs
le
roy
i
never
met
her
never
knew
of
her
existence
until
she
was
a
widow
with
a
son
three
years
old
she
looked
the
curiosity
she
was
too
well
bred
to
express
in
words
do
you
care
to
know
the
reason
why
asked
ford
i
confess
you
have
aroused
my
curiosity
she
replied
with
a
smile
then
i
will
tell
you
he
said
when
i
was
quite
a
lad
i
ran
away
to
australia
seized
with
a
then
very
prevalent
in
new
york
after
years
of
ill
luck
sickness
and
misfortune
i
struck
a
bonanza
i
was
an
old
man
then
and
my
heart
yearned
for
the
home
and
the
friends
of
my
youth
i
came
home
determined
to
share
my
wealth
and
prosperity
with
them
but
all
were
dead
mother
father
and
even
the
toddling
little
sister
i
had
loved
so
dearly
she
had
married
and
died
in
a
short
time
after
leaving
one
daughter
whom
i
found
it
impossible
to
trace
several
years
later
i
discovered
my
missing
niece
by
a
fortunate
accident
in
the
brilliant
novelist
mrs
lynn
she
is
very
young
to
have
achieved
fame
in
the
literary
world
said
the
lady
the
result
of
necessity
my
dear
madam
ford
replied
losing
her
husband
before
the
birth
of
her
child
my
niece
scarcely
more
than
a
child
herself
then
was
thrown
upon
her
own
resources
for
support
she
became
a
writer
and
most
fortunately
for
the
sake
of
the
little
helpless
being
dependent
upon
her
care
she
succeeded
where
the
many
fail
he
ended
leaving
mrs
le
roy
unspoken
curiosity
on
the
subject
of
lynn
even
greater
than
before
through
his
meager
explanation
chapter
lii
mr
le
roy
led
his
beautiful
guest
to
the
library
and
placed
a
chair
beside
the
table
where
he
usually
sat
to
read
laurel
sat
silently
a
moment
with
averted
face
she
was
fighting
down
her
heart
thrusting
back
the
memories
that
would
arise
like
pallid
ghosts
from
the
dead
past
here
in
this
room
nay
in
this
very
chair
where
she
was
sitting
leon
had
wooed
her
for
his
wife
she
could
be
cold
and
proud
in
the
grand
it
was
there
that
he
had
put
her
away
from
him
there
that
he
had
spoken
the
cruel
angry
words
that
sundered
their
hearts
and
lives
forever
the
memory
of
that
night
and
that
scene
hardened
her
heart
to
her
unforgiving
husband
and
helped
her
to
be
cold
and
careless
here
it
was
all
different
this
quiet
retreat
was
hallowed
by
some
of
the
sweetest
moments
of
her
life
that
hour
which
had
lifted
her
from
dumb
jealous
misery
and
despair
to
the
heights
of
bliss
had
come
to
her
here
the
memory
of
her
year
of
wedded
happiness
rushed
over
her
with
all
the
love
and
joy
that
had
been
crowded
into
it
she
trembled
she
recalled
all
the
horror
and
despair
that
had
followed
after
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
was
a
hideous
dream
from
which
she
would
awaken
presently
she
longed
to
cry
out
aloud
to
rush
from
this
haunted
room
to
do
anything
that
would
free
her
from
the
gaze
of
those
sad
dark
eyes
whose
burning
glances
as
they
sought
her
face
seemed
to
read
her
secret
and
to
plead
with
her
for
love
and
reconciliation
a
smothered
gasp
and
she
shook
off
the
dangerous
luring
spell
and
became
herself
again
calm
indifferent
yet
gracious
the
woman
that
slighted
and
scorned
love
had
made
icily
splendid
fatally
fair
as
many
a
man
had
owned
to
his
cost
she
looked
about
for
something
to
divert
her
attention
and
saw
just
at
her
hand
lying
on
the
table
a
volume
elegantly
bound
in
crimson
and
gold
she
took
it
in
her
hand
and
read
aloud
the
title
on
the
back
laurel
blossoms
laurel
blossoms
she
repeated
and
turned
to
the
with
widening
eyes
and
a
swift
color
that
went
and
came
from
white
to
red
and
from
red
to
white
she
read
by
louis
vane
leon
had
drawn
a
chair
near
her
he
spoke
to
her
now
in
a
calm
carefully
modulated
voice
that
went
far
toward
restoring
her
shattered
equanimity
that
is
a
collection
of
tales
and
essays
lynn
arranged
by
myself
for
publication
the
author
is
long
since
dead
he
was
my
father
yes
she
murmured
turning
the
precious
pages
slowly
with
her
trembling
hands
her
eyes
downcast
and
bravely
keeping
back
their
threatening
tears
perhaps
some
one
has
told
you
the
romantic
story
of
my
marriage
mrs
lynn
he
said
watching
the
fair
drooping
face
with
earnest
eyes
she
shook
her
head
she
would
not
trust
herself
to
speak
no
he
said
then
perhaps
i
will
tell
you
some
day
myself
you
love
romance
and
tragedy
i
infer
from
your
books
my
marriage
had
the
elements
of
both
in
it
she
bowed
again
silently
it
was
quite
impossible
for
her
to
utter
a
word
just
then
but
she
said
to
herself
with
a
sort
of
passionate
disdain
that
he
was
very
daring
indeed
to
speak
to
her
of
his
marriage
to
her
of
all
women
in
the
world
he
went
on
in
his
quiet
musical
tones
louis
vane
was
a
genius
but
like
many
another
gifted
spirit
he
smirched
the
glorious
talents
given
him
in
the
degradation
of
strong
drink
he
loved
pleasure
better
than
fame
but
for
his
weakness
and
his
madness
he
would
have
made
a
name
that
must
have
gone
ringing
down
the
ages
she
was
silent
steeling
her
heart
to
the
sweetness
of
those
words
of
praise
she
remembered
that
strong
sweet
voice
that
praised
louis
vane
for
his
genius
now
denouncing
and
scorning
her
that
night
long
years
ago
as
a
drunken
journalist
daughter
when
my
wife
died
seven
years
ago
went
on
leon
i
made
it
my
duty
and
my
pleasure
to
gather
her
father
miscellaneous
writings
from
the
journals
and
magazines
where
they
were
scattered
and
publish
them
in
one
volume
that
they
might
be
rescued
from
oblivion
and
preserved
for
the
pleasure
of
his
admirers
the
book
had
a
great
sale
it
was
very
popular
have
you
never
seen
it
before
mrs
lynn
again
she
shook
her
head
in
silence
then
let
me
beg
your
acceptance
of
this
copy
i
should
like
you
to
read
it
i
assure
you
it
will
repay
perusal
you
may
wonder
at
its
fanciful
name
my
dead
young
wife
was
called
laurel
is
it
not
a
sweet
name
in
memory
of
her
i
called
it
blossoms
would
he
never
have
done
speaking
a
strange
softness
was
stealing
over
her
heart
that
frightened
her
no
other
atonement
on
earth
could
have
touched
and
moved
her
like
this
one
it
was
what
she
could
have
wished
most
upon
earth
to
have
her
father
brilliant
essays
collected
into
this
beautiful
volume
and
yet
she
had
never
thought
of
doing
it
herself
a
pang
of
pierced
her
heart
forgive
me
father
she
whispered
inly
as
if
the
dead
were
present
in
spirit
and
could
know
and
feel
her
mute
repentance
i
have
been
so
absorbed
in
my
own
selfish
sorrows
and
triumphs
i
forgot
to
rescue
your
genius
from
the
oblivion
that
must
have
ingulfed
it
but
for
this
effort
all
this
while
he
was
waiting
for
an
answer
what
must
he
think
of
her
strange
silence
with
a
great
effort
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
face
and
said
in
tones
ringing
with
latent
sarcasm
and
incredulity
you
must
have
loved
your
wife
very
dearly
mr
le
roy
more
than
i
knew
he
answered
simply
and
the
tone
even
more
than
the
words
betrayed
the
burden
of
remorse
and
sorrow
his
heart
had
borne
for
years
she
rose
abruptly
with
the
precious
volume
of
her
father
writings
clasped
tightly
in
her
hands
she
was
afraid
to
stay
longer
afraid
of
that
sweet
and
subtle
pity
that
thrilled
her
woman
heart
i
have
made
too
long
a
call
for
a
first
visit
she
said
another
time
will
do
for
the
books
of
which
we
spoke
the
made
me
forget
you
have
forgotten
the
flowers
i
promised
to
show
you
too
he
said
let
me
take
you
to
the
garden
now
some
other
time
i
must
really
go
now
she
said
feeling
that
for
this
one
day
she
had
already
borne
all
that
she
could
bear
he
did
not
urge
the
point
perhaps
the
trial
was
as
hard
for
him
as
for
her
will
you
drive
with
me
he
asked
as
he
touched
her
hand
at
parting
there
are
some
beautiful
views
in
this
vicinity
that
i
should
like
to
have
the
pleasure
of
showing
you
yes
i
will
go
she
answered
hastily
unable
to
deny
herself
the
blended
bliss
and
pain
of
his
companionship
even
while
she
despised
herself
for
what
she
disdainfully
termed
to
herself
her
weakness
chapter
liii
came
one
of
the
fairest
of
summer
days
with
a
sky
and
the
goldenest
sunshine
and
most
fragrant
flowers
laurel
prepared
for
her
drive
with
mr
le
roy
with
a
beating
heart
she
felt
that
she
was
acting
imprudently
in
going
with
him
for
she
scarcely
dared
trust
herself
in
his
presence
but
she
could
not
draw
back
from
her
promise
an
irresistible
fascination
drew
her
on
to
the
meeting
with
the
husband
so
hopelessly
and
madly
loved
in
the
long
years
while
she
wandered
afar
from
him
an
alien
from
his
home
and
heart
some
strange
thoughts
were
stirring
in
her
heart
evoked
by
his
looks
and
words
she
could
scarcely
fail
to
see
that
he
had
repented
perhaps
if
he
knew
that
laurel
vane
was
living
he
would
forgive
her
and
take
her
back
her
fault
might
not
seem
so
black
and
bitter
now
seen
through
the
kindly
veil
of
years
she
said
to
herself
he
might
even
love
and
trust
me
again
but
there
came
to
her
a
sudden
remembrance
of
words
he
had
spoken
long
ago
when
he
had
told
her
of
maud
merivale
deceit
and
falsity
i
could
never
again
love
a
woman
who
had
deceived
me
once
fallen
from
its
pedestal
the
broken
idol
could
never
be
restored
again
she
looked
at
the
beautiful
face
reflected
in
the
glittering
mirror
and
a
hopeless
sigh
drifted
across
her
lips
i
am
a
idol
she
said
drearily
i
have
fallen
from
my
place
in
his
heart
and
i
can
never
be
taken
back
leon
is
too
proud
to
forgive
my
girlhood
sin
she
had
not
been
unloved
in
all
these
years
proud
men
and
gifted
had
bowed
before
her
won
by
her
beauty
and
her
genius
they
marveled
at
her
coldness
her
indifference
no
one
guessed
at
the
mad
love
lying
deep
in
her
heart
under
the
ashes
of
the
dead
years
a
smoldering
fire
that
in
the
past
few
days
had
leaped
into
a
living
flame
it
needed
all
her
strength
all
her
pride
to
fight
it
back
she
went
with
him
and
when
he
saw
her
he
could
scarcely
repress
a
startled
cry
she
had
chosen
the
colors
that
always
became
his
young
wife
best
white
and
scarlet
her
white
hat
and
a
wreath
of
scarlet
poppies
some
scarlet
were
fastened
in
the
neck
of
her
white
dress
she
was
so
like
so
like
his
dead
wife
that
it
would
only
have
seemed
natural
to
have
taken
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
and
called
her
by
the
name
of
the
dead
suddenly
as
they
paused
before
the
white
gates
of
a
great
wide
inclosure
she
uttered
a
cry
of
dismay
this
is
the
cemetery
mr
le
roy
surely
you
did
not
mean
to
bring
me
here
yes
he
answered
and
helped
her
down
from
the
landau
and
led
her
into
the
grim
necropolis
of
the
dead
she
did
not
understand
she
walked
by
him
silent
and
frightened
among
the
gleaming
marbles
the
shrubbery
the
beautiful
flowers
with
which
loving
hearts
had
decorated
the
graves
of
their
dead
she
heard
her
husband
dreamily
repeating
some
sad
familiar
words
the
massy
marbles
rest
on
the
lips
that
we
have
prest
in
their
bloom
and
the
names
we
loved
to
hear
have
been
carved
for
many
a
year
on
the
tomb
suddenly
he
drew
her
hand
in
his
arm
and
led
her
down
a
shaded
green
in
a
minute
they
paused
before
a
little
plot
of
ground
whose
turf
was
bright
with
beds
of
rarest
flowers
in
the
midst
was
a
single
grave
with
roses
and
trailing
over
it
laurel
lifted
her
eyes
and
read
the
name
cut
deep
into
the
gleaming
marble
shaft
laurel
beloved
wife
of
leon
le
roy
she
felt
a
strangely
hysterical
inclination
to
laugh
out
aloud
how
strange
it
seemed
to
stand
there
so
full
of
life
and
youth
and
passion
and
read
her
own
name
carved
upon
a
gravestone
how
strange
how
horrible
to
feel
that
standing
there
by
her
husband
side
she
was
as
dead
to
him
as
if
indeed
her
lifeless
clay
were
moldering
in
that
low
green
grave
his
low
deep
voice
broke
the
trance
of
hysterical
horror
that
held
her
senses
enchained
lynn
i
told
you
yesterday
that
there
were
elements
of
romance
and
tragedy
in
my
marriage
that
might
interest
even
you
i
promised
too
that
i
would
tell
you
the
story
some
day
here
at
poor
grave
i
propose
to
keep
my
word
he
found
her
a
seat
and
she
waited
silently
to
hear
him
speak
she
was
most
curious
to
hear
the
story
of
her
girlhood
love
and
temptation
told
by
her
husband
lips
from
his
own
standpoint
chapter
liv
leon
le
roy
threw
himself
down
on
the
green
turf
at
feet
and
resting
his
arm
on
his
wife
grave
leaned
his
head
in
his
hand
so
resting
he
could
look
up
and
note
every
expression
of
the
beautiful
face
above
him
the
face
deathly
pale
with
emotion
now
for
all
she
tried
so
bravely
to
appear
politely
calm
and
interested
like
the
stranger
she
pretended
to
be
do
you
care
to
hear
this
story
i
am
about
to
tell
you
he
asked
abruptly
i
am
sure
i
shall
be
interested
she
replied
gently
and
thus
encouraged
he
began
it
is
more
than
nine
years
ago
now
that
my
mother
received
a
letter
from
a
lady
friend
in
new
york
gordon
the
wife
of
the
publisher
perhaps
you
know
him
lynn
he
said
gordon
is
my
publisher
she
replied
he
had
an
only
child
a
beautiful
daughter
said
mr
le
roy
she
had
betrothed
herself
to
a
poor
young
man
of
whom
her
parents
disapproved
they
proposed
to
break
off
the
match
by
strategy
if
possible
they
sent
their
daughter
to
eden
to
remain
a
few
months
proposing
to
send
her
lover
abroad
during
her
absence
and
so
separate
them
as
to
end
the
affair
in
the
quietest
manner
possible
he
paused
but
she
made
no
comment
on
his
words
only
inclined
her
golden
head
attentively
i
was
years
old
when
beatrix
gordon
came
to
eden
she
a
beautiful
child
of
sixteen
went
on
leon
slowly
as
if
looking
back
into
the
past
perhaps
you
will
think
i
was
too
old
for
her
lynn
but
my
heart
was
carried
by
storm
as
it
were
by
the
lovely
girl
i
think
almost
from
the
first
hour
of
our
meeting
i
recognized
my
fate
in
her
she
was
like
no
other
woman
i
ever
met
if
i
talked
to
you
all
day
lynn
said
leon
looking
deep
into
her
eyes
with
his
dark
mesmeric
orbs
i
could
never
portray
in
words
her
beauty
and
sweetness
there
was
a
charm
of
novelty
about
them
she
was
rarely
original
she
was
afraid
of
me
at
first
piqued
me
although
it
was
my
own
fault
very
soon
i
found
that
my
pique
was
the
offspring
of
unconscious
love
i
leon
le
roy
who
despised
women
who
had
been
angry
at
first
at
the
girl
coming
had
lost
my
heart
to
the
slip
of
a
girl
who
belonged
to
another
the
bitter
consciousness
of
that
latter
fact
aroused
my
jealousy
and
added
fuel
to
the
fire
of
my
passion
i
was
angry
with
myself
ashamed
of
myself
yet
i
could
no
more
have
checked
the
course
of
my
strong
passionate
love
than
i
could
have
stemmed
the
tide
of
a
rushing
river
can
you
understand
me
mrs
lynn
she
answered
quietly
yes
but
to
her
own
heart
she
said
ah
if
he
only
knew
then
you
may
guess
something
of
what
i
suffered
said
leon
and
for
a
moment
he
was
silent
and
his
gaze
turned
from
her
face
as
he
seemed
lost
in
retrospection
she
looked
at
the
dark
haughtily
handsome
face
and
her
heart
thrilled
within
her
it
had
all
its
old
luring
magnetic
charm
for
her
she
had
repented
her
fault
long
ago
she
was
sorry
for
her
sin
bitterly
sorry
but
looking
on
her
face
now
she
did
not
wonder
that
she
had
sinned
for
his
sake
in
spite
of
time
in
spite
of
pride
the
old
love
was
strong
within
her
she
might
have
exclaimed
with
byron
i
deemed
that
time
i
deemed
that
pride
had
quenched
at
length
my
early
flame
nor
knew
till
seated
by
thy
side
my
heart
in
all
save
hope
the
same
it
was
well
for
her
that
when
he
resumed
his
story
he
did
not
look
up
too
much
of
her
heart
was
written
on
her
lovely
mobile
face
from
the
despair
of
my
jealous
love
and
misery
i
wakened
to
passionate
bliss
he
continued
i
know
not
when
the
child
first
shyness
and
dread
of
me
changed
to
a
tenderer
feeling
but
it
came
upon
me
suddenly
and
with
heavenly
sweetness
that
she
loved
me
she
had
forgotten
her
lover
in
new
york
lynn
i
swear
i
believed
she
loved
me
even
as
i
loved
her
with
a
singleness
and
depth
of
devotion
such
as
few
hearts
are
capable
of
feeling
god
forgive
me
that
i
doubted
her
once
no
one
was
ever
more
cruelly
punished
for
unbelief
and
hardness
than
i
have
been
with
his
eyes
downcast
upon
that
low
green
grave
he
did
not
see
how
bitterly
her
lip
curled
as
it
always
did
when
that
night
of
her
betrayal
rushed
bleakly
over
her
she
gave
me
her
tender
trusting
heart
and
her
beautiful
self
he
went
on
we
were
married
her
parents
were
absent
and
it
was
a
very
quiet
ceremony
in
a
quiet
church
that
gave
me
the
desire
of
my
heart
we
went
abroad
for
our
honeymoon
and
remained
more
than
a
year
a
sigh
heavy
with
his
heart
despair
drifted
over
his
lips
a
year
mrs
lynn
a
golden
year
into
whose
short
space
was
crowded
all
the
real
happiness
and
bliss
of
my
life
she
made
me
the
happiest
most
blessed
of
men
in
that
brief
time
i
am
years
old
lynn
but
it
seems
to
me
i
have
only
really
lived
one
year
one
year
that
shines
on
me
from
the
past
like
a
radiant
star
in
the
darkness
of
night
chapter
lv
laurel
felt
a
dreary
kind
of
pleasure
in
hearing
her
husband
ascribe
to
her
the
only
real
happiness
of
his
life
it
was
some
atonement
for
all
that
she
had
borne
all
that
she
had
suffered
her
heart
beat
quick
and
fast
beneath
her
white
robe
he
went
on
sadly
never
was
there
a
stormier
ending
to
a
beautiful
sunny
summer
day
never
a
sadder
waking
from
a
happy
dream
and
it
was
all
so
swift
and
sudden
it
was
like
burns
poem
pause
the
dire
extremes
between
she
made
me
blest
and
broke
my
heart
ah
yes
laurel
could
remember
how
swift
and
sudden
it
had
all
been
how
like
a
thunderbolt
falling
from
a
clear
sky
she
sat
there
pale
and
silent
and
listened
to
her
own
story
told
by
her
lips
and
felt
a
strange
dreary
aching
pity
for
the
girl
who
had
loved
and
suffered
so
much
quite
as
if
it
had
been
another
woman
than
herself
we
came
home
at
last
he
said
my
mother
was
very
ill
and
my
wife
nursed
and
tended
her
unweariedly
and
with
all
a
daughter
devotion
until
she
became
convalescent
then
the
hour
of
my
awakening
came
it
was
so
swift
so
horribly
sudden
i
wonder
sometimes
that
it
did
not
kill
me
ah
she
had
wondered
so
often
that
she
too
had
not
died
beneath
the
stroke
of
that
cruel
fate
but
she
made
no
sign
she
only
sat
still
and
looked
at
the
bowed
head
before
her
and
listened
to
his
words
the
gordons
came
down
from
new
york
one
day
quite
unexpectedly
to
visit
their
daughter
i
was
delighted
lynn
because
i
thought
it
would
add
to
my
darling
happiness
i
thought
i
would
surprise
her
so
i
concealed
the
fact
of
their
arrival
and
led
her
into
their
presence
full
of
happiness
myself
in
the
prospect
of
witnessing
her
amazement
and
joy
lynn
held
her
costly
fan
before
her
face
a
moment
she
did
not
want
him
to
see
the
spasms
of
agony
that
convulsed
her
face
ah
how
bitterly
it
all
rushed
over
her
the
pain
the
shame
the
horror
of
that
supreme
moment
he
was
now
portraying
you
are
smothering
a
yawn
behind
your
fan
he
said
does
my
story
weary
you
lynn
it
has
not
developed
into
a
plot
for
a
novel
yet
has
it
you
see
i
have
been
telling
it
in
the
plainest
fashion
i
have
not
embellished
it
like
a
and
besides
up
to
the
moment
of
which
i
have
spoken
it
had
not
developed
any
phases
of
the
tragic
it
had
only
been
the
simplest
sweetest
love
idyl
that
was
ever
lived
that
is
perfectly
true
she
said
to
herself
with
a
burning
face
and
a
strangely
throbbing
heart
but
in
the
moment
when
i
led
my
beautiful
wife
into
the
at
eden
to
meet
her
parents
the
came
said
leon
le
roy
the
tragic
element
entered
my
story
then
can
you
guess
what
happened
mrs
lynn
your
wife
was
properly
surprised
and
glad
to
see
her
parents
i
presume
said
lynn
with
an
air
of
polite
interest
his
dark
lashes
lifted
he
gazed
at
her
sadly
a
moment
then
they
fell
again
no
one
could
guess
what
take
place
said
mr
le
roy
it
was
like
a
romance
you
have
never
written
anything
stranger
in
all
your
novels
lynn
but
you
must
not
expect
me
to
describe
it
to
you
in
the
language
of
fiction
your
own
imagination
must
invest
it
with
all
the
eloquence
it
merits
i
have
been
surprised
at
many
things
in
my
life
lynn
but
i
was
never
more
surprised
never
more
shocked
than
i
was
in
the
moment
when
i
led
my
beatrix
up
to
her
mother
i
had
expected
demonstrations
of
delighted
affection
i
beheld
only
utter
dismay
and
confusion
can
you
believe
it
lynn
my
young
wife
and
the
gordons
had
never
met
before
in
their
lives
a
faint
murmur
came
from
her
lips
meant
to
convey
surprise
he
accepted
it
as
such
and
went
on
slowly
then
it
all
came
out
i
had
been
deceived
i
had
been
made
the
victim
of
a
clever
conspiracy
two
beautiful
clever
girls
had
plotted
together
and
the
result
was
this
beatrix
gordon
had
never
come
to
eden
she
had
gone
away
and
married
her
lover
and
she
had
sent
laurel
vane
to
us
in
her
place
it
was
cleverly
planned
as
i
have
said
just
now
but
i
have
often
wondered
how
laurel
carried
it
out
and
escaped
detection
she
was
innocent
and
transparent
as
a
child
she
was
frightened
always
i
know
for
when
all
came
out
i
could
recall
many
things
that
pointed
to
the
truth
if
only
i
had
not
been
so
blind
but
fate
helped
it
on
and
made
me
the
husband
not
of
beatrix
gordon
the
daughter
of
the
wealthy
publisher
but
of
laurel
vane
the
penniless
orphan
child
of
an
author
who
with
the
genius
of
an
edgar
allan
poe
had
shared
all
the
weaknesses
of
the
great
poet
and
died
as
miserable
he
paused
laurel
wondered
if
he
could
hear
her
heart
beating
in
the
stillness
of
that
place
of
graves
it
sounded
so
loudly
in
her
ears
it
almost
drowned
his
voice
it
was
only
by
the
greatest
effort
of
her
pride
and
will
that
she
preserved
her
outward
calmness
it
was
a
terrible
discovery
for
me
to
make
he
said
i
was
wounded
in
my
love
in
my
faith
in
my
pride
can
you
imagine
what
i
did
mrs
lynn
he
had
lifted
his
drooping
head
and
was
looking
straight
into
her
face
she
looked
back
at
him
steadily
almost
scornfully
as
she
replied
you
loved
her
so
dearly
and
she
made
you
so
happy
perhaps
i
should
not
err
if
i
said
that
you
forgave
the
girl
for
her
sin
he
crushed
back
something
like
a
groan
upon
his
lips
do
you
think
i
should
have
done
so
mrs
lynn
he
asked
i
do
not
know
how
to
answer
you
she
said
and
her
voice
trembled
from
a
woman
standpoint
i
should
answer
yes
but
men
are
unlike
women
are
they
not
harder
colder
prone
to
harsh
judgments
yes
men
are
harder
he
said
and
was
silent
until
she
broke
the
strange
stillness
with
her
strange
voice
do
you
love
tennyson
mr
le
roy
i
do
i
think
one
of
the
grandest
most
beautiful
passages
in
the
book
is
king
arthur
forgiveness
of
guinevere
terrible
sin
do
you
remember
those
words
i
forgive
thee
as
eternal
god
forgives
her
sin
was
not
like
guinevere
he
said
hastily
and
therefore
the
more
easily
to
be
forgiven
she
said
do
you
not
think
that
your
wife
suffered
for
her
sin
and
after
all
it
was
for
love
sake
and
women
do
and
dare
so
much
for
love
sake
remember
you
are
speaking
as
if
i
did
not
forgive
her
he
said
i
had
not
told
you
that
yet
but
i
fancied
it
must
be
so
she
said
because
this
is
her
grave
the
shot
went
home
he
shivered
and
a
hollow
groan
escaped
his
lips
would
she
have
died
for
such
a
cause
he
asked
and
she
answered
gravely
and
with
a
touch
of
sadness
women
hearts
have
broken
for
even
lighter
causes
to
herself
she
said
mournfully
i
should
have
died
myself
if
it
had
not
been
for
little
laurie
coming
i
could
not
have
lived
through
these
weary
years
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
little
child
that
loved
me
heart
was
broken
then
he
said
for
i
refused
to
forgive
her
lynn
i
was
hard
and
stern
and
angry
but
i
never
dreamed
what
would
happen
what
did
she
do
inquired
the
brilliant
novelist
with
interest
she
went
away
that
night
lynn
and
all
search
for
her
proved
futile
and
vain
in
a
few
days
after
a
body
washed
up
from
the
river
a
young
woman
they
said
it
was
laurel
my
missing
wife
you
know
the
rest
this
is
her
grave
laurel
looked
at
the
grassy
mound
with
a
strange
dreary
wonder
over
the
waif
whom
they
had
buried
there
she
wondered
what
her
name
and
history
had
been
perhaps
as
sad
as
mine
she
sighed
to
herself
this
is
her
grave
he
repeated
ah
lynn
you
have
a
glowing
vivid
imagination
can
you
fancy
what
i
have
suffered
can
you
comprehend
how
the
demons
of
remorse
and
despair
have
pursued
me
unceasingly
then
you
repented
when
too
late
she
said
too
late
he
echoed
drearily
yes
i
repented
when
ah
lynn
are
there
any
sadder
words
than
those
two
in
the
english
language
yes
i
think
so
she
replied
you
remember
what
the
poet
whittier
has
written
all
sad
words
of
tongue
or
pen
the
saddest
are
these
it
might
have
been
might
have
been
he
repeated
ah
yes
i
can
testify
to
all
the
sadness
of
those
words
have
i
not
felt
it
all
since
she
died
my
life
has
been
one
dreary
penance
one
long
regret
ah
lynn
if
only
i
had
forgiven
her
if
only
i
had
not
driven
her
from
me
by
my
harshness
and
cruelty
i
was
a
fool
and
blind
she
loved
me
and
made
me
happy
she
sinned
through
her
love
first
for
beatrix
gordon
then
for
me
her
story
is
the
saddest
the
most
pitiful
i
ever
heard
or
read
i
should
have
forgiven
the
child
she
was
nothing
but
a
child
and
she
had
not
been
well
taught
but
it
was
all
so
sudden
and
i
was
half
dazed
by
the
shock
ah
well
i
have
had
ample
time
to
repent
my
haste
and
madness
the
years
have
been
long
and
dreary
enough
without
my
darling
every
time
i
come
here
to
this
quiet
grave
i
whisper
to
the
silent
dust
beneath
to
call
back
the
days
that
are
not
my
eyes
were
blinded
your
words
were
few
do
you
know
the
truth
now
up
in
heaven
laurel
laurel
tender
and
true
how
the
sweet
passion
and
sorrow
of
the
words
moved
her
he
was
sorry
for
his
cruelty
he
repented
it
all
she
said
to
herself
that
if
she
had
really
been
dead
in
that
grave
beneath
him
she
must
have
heard
those
words
they
would
have
thrilled
even
her
dust
beautiful
words
came
into
her
mind
my
dust
would
hear
him
and
beat
had
it
lain
for
a
century
dead
would
start
and
tremble
under
his
feet
and
blossom
in
purple
and
red
he
looked
up
at
her
sitting
there
so
fair
and
young
and
so
like
the
dead
and
his
heart
went
out
to
her
in
passionate
adoration
he
cried
out
hoarsely
in
his
deep
emotion
lynn
what
do
you
think
have
i
really
sinned
beyond
forgiveness
if
laurel
could
come
back
from
the
world
of
shadows
do
you
think
she
would
forgive
me
for
that
night
are
you
asking
me
to
tell
you
what
i
should
do
in
your
wife
place
mr
le
roy
she
asked
him
in
a
low
strange
voice
yes
put
yourself
in
her
place
he
replied
tell
me
could
you
forgive
me
and
love
me
again
after
the
coldness
with
which
i
put
my
wife
from
me
that
night
i
do
not
believe
i
could
ever
forget
or
forgive
such
unkindness
she
replied
he
looked
at
her
keenly
with
a
brooding
trouble
in
his
eyes
perhaps
you
do
not
look
at
the
subject
quite
as
my
young
wife
would
have
done
he
said
anxiously
laurel
loved
me
lynn
do
not
forget
that
would
she
not
forgive
me
for
love
sweet
sake
no
i
do
not
think
she
would
her
pride
would
be
stronger
than
her
love
answered
the
beautiful
woman
laurel
was
not
proud
said
leon
le
roy
not
when
you
loved
her
not
when
she
was
happy
said
lynn
but
can
you
not
fancy
the
sweetness
of
even
such
a
nature
as
hers
turned
to
gall
by
wrong
and
ruth
i
repeat
it
mr
le
roy
if
i
were
in
your
laurel
place
if
i
could
come
back
after
all
those
years
i
believe
i
should
be
as
proud
and
cold
as
i
was
gentle
once
i
do
not
believe
i
could
forgive
you
he
sprung
up
he
held
out
his
arms
to
her
yearningly
his
face
transfigured
by
the
yearning
passion
of
his
heart
laurel
laurel
do
not
speak
to
me
so
cruelly
do
not
judge
me
so
hardly
he
cried
do
you
think
i
do
not
know
you
my
darling
that
i
have
not
known
you
since
the
moment
we
met
again
that
senseless
marble
lies
when
it
says
my
wife
is
dead
you
are
she
you
are
laurel
le
roy
chapter
lvi
there
was
a
moment
of
the
most
utter
silence
while
leon
le
wild
appealing
words
died
upon
the
stillness
of
the
solemn
place
lynn
was
struck
dumb
for
an
instant
by
the
suddenness
and
passion
of
her
husband
accusation
she
grew
ghastly
pale
she
trembled
like
a
leaf
the
denial
she
would
have
uttered
died
gaspingly
upon
her
quivering
lips
you
are
my
wife
he
repeated
there
was
never
but
one
face
one
voice
in
this
world
like
yours
and
they
belonged
to
laurel
vane
my
darling
you
will
not
deny
the
truth
you
did
not
throw
yourself
into
the
dark
cruel
river
that
summer
night
you
went
away
and
hid
yourself
from
me
in
the
wide
world
it
was
some
unknown
waif
whom
we
buried
in
this
shaft
for
you
my
own
sweet
one
that
marble
cross
speaks
falsely
thank
god
you
live
laurel
to
hear
the
story
of
my
sorrow
and
repentance
you
can
not
you
will
not
refuse
to
forgive
me
she
sprung
from
her
seat
as
he
advanced
and
slowly
retreated
before
him
her
eyes
wide
and
dark
with
terror
she
put
out
her
white
hands
before
her
as
if
to
ward
off
a
blow
you
are
mad
she
cried
hoarsely
you
are
simply
mad
mr
le
roy
your
great
sorrow
has
unhinged
your
brain
come
away
from
this
gloomy
place
of
graves
into
the
world
again
and
i
will
try
to
forget
your
momentary
madness
do
you
mean
to
deny
the
truth
he
cried
gazing
reproachfully
at
the
beautiful
defiant
face
is
it
right
to
scorn
me
laurel
when
i
have
so
bitterly
repented
the
wrong
i
did
you
is
it
right
to
defraud
me
of
my
child
love
right
to
defraud
the
child
of
his
father
love
do
you
think
i
do
not
know
that
your
beautiful
little
laurence
is
my
own
child
shall
i
tell
you
why
my
mother
fainted
in
your
rose
garden
that
day
she
lifted
the
boy
dark
clustering
locks
from
his
temples
and
saw
the
familiar
le
roy
the
crimson
heart
that
you
my
wife
have
so
often
kissed
on
my
temple
i
saw
her
although
i
made
no
sign
laurel
you
will
give
me
my
son
you
will
come
home
to
eden
yourself
forgetting
and
forgiving
all
the
past
will
you
not
my
injured
wife
i
will
atone
for
my
momentary
hardness
by
the
devotion
of
a
lifetime
he
held
out
his
arms
yearningly
to
the
beautiful
startled
woman
standing
dumbly
before
him
with
a
smile
of
scorn
on
her
perfect
lips
she
was
terribly
frightened
when
she
found
that
he
had
recognized
her
but
she
had
no
thought
of
confessing
the
truth
all
the
hard
bitter
pride
that
had
grown
up
in
her
heart
these
eight
years
was
at
war
with
her
husband
claim
she
held
her
hands
out
before
her
as
if
to
ward
him
off
as
he
came
nearer
to
her
side
i
can
only
say
as
i
did
just
now
that
you
are
mad
she
said
i
can
excuse
you
because
i
know
that
your
brain
must
be
turned
by
your
sorrow
but
this
must
go
no
further
i
will
not
endure
it
there
are
limits
that
even
my
patience
will
not
suffer
to
be
passed
i
am
nothing
to
you
leon
le
roy
nothing
as
for
the
child
you
have
deceived
yourself
it
is
the
scar
of
a
wound
on
the
child
temple
not
a
as
you
think
he
stared
at
her
like
one
dazed
his
arms
dropping
weakly
at
his
sides
that
she
would
refuse
to
forgive
him
he
had
expected
and
dreaded
but
that
she
would
deny
her
identity
when
taxed
with
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
it
put
quite
a
new
phase
upon
the
matter
she
had
not
staggered
his
convictions
in
the
least
but
she
had
shown
him
what
ground
both
stood
upon
he
was
powerless
helpless
there
was
nothing
for
him
but
to
bow
to
her
will
you
deny
my
charges
he
said
you
cut
the
ground
from
under
my
feet
and
leave
me
without
a
hope
with
nothing
but
this
grave
yes
she
answered
pale
as
death
beautiful
proud
defiant
i
forgive
you
for
your
brief
madness
we
will
never
recur
to
it
again
now
will
you
take
me
home
in
a
moment
he
answered
he
was
busy
plucking
some
flowers
from
the
grave
he
held
them
out
to
her
lynn
will
you
take
these
flowers
he
said
take
them
and
keep
them
they
may
remind
you
sometimes
of
all
that
is
buried
in
this
grave
for
me
love
hope
happiness
she
took
them
silently
and
they
went
away
from
that
place
of
tombs
into
the
busy
beautiful
world
again
they
spoke
but
little
driving
home
and
then
only
on
indifferent
subjects
never
on
the
theme
lying
deep
in
their
hearts
the
love
the
remorse
the
unsatisfied
longing
the
fruitless
pain
of
their
lives
but
laurel
when
she
had
reached
her
own
private
room
threw
herself
down
upon
the
floor
with
a
great
tearless
sob
of
utter
agony
oh
how
cruel
i
am
she
cried
for
the
sake
of
my
miserable
pride
i
have
murdered
my
own
last
chance
of
happiness
chapter
lvii
it
was
a
long
while
before
laurel
recovered
her
calmness
she
had
been
severely
shaken
by
her
interview
with
mr
le
roy
she
did
not
feel
half
so
triumphant
and
victorious
as
she
might
have
done
she
had
repulsed
her
husband
she
had
made
him
suffer
all
that
she
had
suffered
that
night
when
he
had
renounced
her
but
there
was
none
of
the
sweetness
of
victory
in
her
triumph
she
was
at
war
with
herself
her
own
heart
was
a
traitor
it
only
ached
over
the
conquest
of
love
by
ruthless
pride
the
triumph
was
bitterer
than
defeat
when
she
dragged
herself
up
from
the
floor
at
last
with
all
her
misery
written
on
her
face
she
saw
a
letter
lying
on
her
it
had
been
brought
in
by
her
maid
during
her
absence
she
took
it
up
and
found
that
it
was
addressed
to
herself
in
the
delicate
refined
hand
of
mrs
le
roy
an
expression
of
dismay
and
dread
came
over
the
beautiful
face
why
has
she
written
to
me
she
asked
herself
does
she
too
mean
to
claim
me
and
laurie
she
grew
very
pale
at
the
thought
a
dread
came
over
her
that
they
would
take
her
child
from
her
to
punish
her
for
her
willfulness
and
pride
they
shall
not
have
him
she
said
to
herself
setting
her
little
white
teeth
firmly
together
i
will
take
my
little
son
and
fly
to
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
with
him
i
was
foolish
and
weak
even
to
have
come
here
i
forgot
many
things
i
ought
to
have
remembered
i
forgot
utterly
that
birth
mark
on
my
child
temple
the
of
all
the
le
roys
i
never
dreamed
that
they
would
suspect
me
i
thought
that
grave
with
my
name
upon
it
was
an
all
sufficient
shield
for
me
she
opened
the
letter
and
read
it
it
was
a
beautiful
pathetic
appeal
that
brought
tears
to
laurel
proud
dark
eyes
mrs
le
roy
had
recognized
her
too
she
prayed
her
to
forgive
leon
for
his
hardness
of
heart
and
to
return
to
him
i
do
not
know
whether
my
son
has
recognized
you
or
not
laurel
wrote
the
anxious
mother
you
may
remember
that
he
is
very
proud
and
reserved
he
is
silent
he
makes
no
sign
and
yet
i
think
that
he
could
not
have
failed
to
know
you
forgive
him
laurel
he
has
suffered
bitterly
and
repented
sorely
let
me
tell
him
that
you
are
living
and
that
your
beautiful
little
son
is
his
own
child
let
me
tell
him
that
you
both
will
come
home
to
us
ah
laurel
my
dear
daughter
i
can
not
tell
you
how
tenderly
my
heart
goes
out
to
you
both
for
your
own
sake
and
for
that
of
the
child
how
i
love
the
beautiful
manly
little
lad
he
is
the
heir
to
eden
the
last
descendant
of
the
le
roys
my
son
son
my
only
grandchild
all
these
years
you
have
kept
him
from
us
you
have
had
all
his
sweetness
to
yourself
i
have
no
word
of
blame
for
you
my
dear
daughter
i
know
you
were
greatly
wronged
almost
driven
as
it
were
into
the
course
you
adopted
but
you
will
give
him
to
us
now
will
you
not
dear
you
will
come
back
to
the
home
you
never
should
have
left
you
will
be
the
light
of
our
hearts
and
our
eyes
as
you
were
before
that
fatal
night
i
shall
come
to
you
for
your
answer
i
have
not
told
leon
of
my
discovery
i
shall
not
speak
to
him
until
after
i
see
you
but
i
can
not
help
but
hope
that
your
answer
will
be
a
favorable
one
you
would
not
have
come
here
among
us
if
you
had
not
meant
to
be
kind
to
us
i
remember
your
gentle
loving
heart
my
dear
and
although
you
have
the
world
at
your
feet
now
i
think
you
will
be
the
same
tender
loving
little
girl
that
you
were
of
old
you
will
come
home
to
us
soon
you
and
my
darling
little
laurence
laurence
laurence
it
is
only
of
the
child
they
think
only
of
their
heir
to
eden
she
said
to
herself
bitterly
i
see
through
it
all
they
would
endure
the
mother
for
the
child
sake
i
understand
but
it
shall
not
be
i
will
take
my
boy
away
i
have
cared
for
him
all
these
years
and
i
will
do
so
still
they
who
were
so
cruel
to
the
mother
shall
have
none
of
the
child
love
and
when
mrs
le
roy
called
the
next
day
she
was
astounded
to
find
that
carlyle
ford
and
lynn
and
her
son
had
left
belle
vue
the
previous
evening
none
of
the
servants
were
aware
of
their
destination
one
of
them
gave
the
lady
a
note
that
lynn
had
left
behind
for
her
it
was
brief
and
cruelly
cold
i
regret
that
i
can
not
have
the
honor
of
receiving
you
as
we
are
leaving
suddenly
and
for
an
indefinite
time
wrote
lynn
i
must
say
that
your
letter
was
all
greek
to
me
you
seem
laboring
under
some
strange
hallucination
of
the
brain
i
fear
you
are
threatened
with
a
brain
fever
i
would
advise
you
to
consult
a
physician
delays
are
dangerous
in
such
cases
mrs
le
roy
went
home
like
one
dazed
she
had
not
counted
on
such
a
terrible
disappointment
she
had
staked
everything
on
laurel
sweet
forgiving
disposition
she
had
made
no
allowance
for
a
woman
pride
she
went
to
the
library
where
leon
sat
among
his
books
dreaming
not
reading
dreaming
of
a
fair
cold
scornful
face
that
shone
on
him
from
the
walls
of
memory
passionless
pale
cold
face
on
a
gloom
profound
taking
revenge
too
deep
for
a
transient
wrong
he
glanced
up
absently
at
his
mother
entrance
too
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
to
notice
her
irrepressible
agitation
oh
leon
she
cried
out
distressfully
lynn
has
gone
away
she
saw
the
handsome
face
whiten
under
its
healthy
brown
he
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
only
put
out
his
hand
and
drew
her
gently
to
him
then
he
said
in
a
hoarse
strained
voice
well
mother
the
tone
told
her
more
than
words
she
broke
out
vehemently
my
son
did
you
know
did
you
understand
it
was
laurel
your
wife
it
was
your
own
child
can
you
realize
it
my
son
he
answered
wearily
yes
i
know
dear
you
knew
and
you
let
her
go
without
a
word
oh
leon
she
exclaimed
reproachfully
the
dark
mustached
lips
parted
in
a
slight
sad
smile
you
wrong
me
mother
he
said
i
spoke
to
her
i
claimed
her
and
the
child
she
denied
her
identity
she
laughed
me
to
scorn
there
was
nothing
more
for
me
to
say
or
do
you
give
her
up
like
this
her
and
the
heir
to
eden
she
exclaimed
in
dismay
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
she
denies
my
claim
and
that
ends
all
i
make
no
war
upon
women
he
answered
sadly
but
firmly
tears
of
bitter
disappointment
crowded
to
her
eyes
she
had
so
counted
upon
this
reconciliation
so
longed
to
have
laurel
back
laurel
and
the
little
child
who
was
heir
to
eden
and
the
child
will
you
give
him
up
without
a
word
she
asked
in
bitter
disappointment
you
have
every
legal
right
to
him
granted
but
do
you
think
i
could
take
him
from
laurel
no
no
mother
she
shall
keep
the
little
one
we
will
not
disturb
her
it
may
be
some
little
atonement
for
that
night
if
we
leave
her
in
peace
then
with
a
weary
sigh
let
us
drop
the
subject
mother
sorely
disappointed
she
acquiesced
in
his
decision
knowing
that
there
was
no
appeal
from
his
firm
will
chapter
lviii
laurel
had
left
belle
vue
in
a
sudden
panic
of
fear
and
dread
she
was
afraid
that
her
bold
denial
of
her
identity
would
irritate
the
le
roys
into
an
attempt
to
prove
their
charges
and
claim
her
child
she
determined
to
put
a
wide
distance
between
herself
and
her
husband
regretting
in
her
terror
that
she
had
ever
exposed
herself
to
the
danger
of
being
recognized
by
him
she
did
not
confide
to
her
uncle
the
fact
that
she
had
been
charged
with
her
identity
by
her
husband
and
his
mother
she
knew
that
ford
sympathized
with
the
le
roys
in
their
repentance
and
sorrow
and
she
knew
what
his
advice
would
be
she
had
not
confided
to
him
the
reason
of
her
sudden
flitting
she
knew
that
he
was
the
loving
slave
of
her
imperious
will
and
that
she
need
but
express
a
wish
to
have
it
gratified
so
the
grand
home
on
the
hudson
was
deserted
and
they
sought
fresh
fields
and
pastures
new
according
to
capricious
fancy
if
ford
wondered
at
her
fickleness
he
kept
it
to
himself
perhaps
he
was
not
altogether
sorry
that
laurel
was
not
to
leave
him
yet
his
heartstrings
were
very
closely
entwined
around
her
and
her
beautiful
child
he
would
have
been
lonely
indeed
without
them
they
went
to
a
noted
summer
resort
by
the
seashore
and
laurel
declared
that
she
meant
to
labor
diligently
here
on
a
new
book
she
had
commenced
to
write
that
summer
but
the
new
novel
did
not
grow
very
fast
the
brilliant
author
was
restless
and
ill
at
ease
some
days
she
would
devote
to
her
task
with
a
feverish
energy
and
persistence
often
writing
far
into
the
night
again
there
would
be
days
and
days
when
the
manuscript
remained
locked
in
her
desk
neglected
and
untouched
while
laurel
threw
herself
into
the
whirl
of
social
pleasure
with
a
zest
born
of
the
desire
to
forget
but
neither
in
work
nor
pleasure
did
she
find
that
lethean
draught
for
which
her
lips
thirsted
she
was
haunted
by
a
voice
a
face
she
could
not
choose
but
remember
even
if
it
had
been
possible
for
her
to
forget
little
laurence
would
not
have
allowed
her
to
do
so
strange
to
say
the
child
had
taken
a
wondrous
fancy
to
the
le
roys
both
mother
and
son
he
prattled
of
them
often
in
his
pretty
childish
fashion
regretting
that
he
could
not
see
them
again
and
every
word
was
like
a
dagger
in
the
mother
heart
she
knew
that
it
was
nature
and
instinct
clamoring
for
its
own
in
the
heart
sometimes
she
was
almost
melted
sometimes
she
felt
keenly
the
wrong
she
had
done
the
child
in
depriving
him
of
his
father
love
but
her
hard
bitter
pride
was
always
stronger
than
her
pity
and
her
love
little
laurence
found
a
congenial
playmate
at
last
and
his
regrets
for
belle
vue
and
eden
grew
daily
less
and
less
it
was
a
little
girl
of
six
years
old
called
trixy
by
her
nurse
who
brought
her
to
play
on
the
sands
daily
with
her
little
toy
spade
and
bucket
in
laurie
expeditions
with
his
own
nurse
the
two
children
became
acquainted
and
were
soon
inseparable
companions
and
friends
laurence
did
not
rest
until
he
had
made
his
mother
acquainted
with
the
little
beauty
i
can
not
understand
my
feelings
when
i
look
at
little
trixy
lynn
said
to
her
uncle
with
a
pretty
puzzled
air
the
child
face
haunts
me
in
some
inexplicable
manner
she
recalls
the
past
and
yet
i
can
not
remember
whom
she
is
like
she
was
not
fated
to
remain
long
in
ignorance
of
the
resemblance
that
haunted
her
so
strangely
she
was
standing
on
the
shore
one
day
looking
dreamily
out
at
the
swelling
waves
as
they
rolled
in
and
broke
in
crystal
spray
at
her
feet
when
she
was
startled
by
little
trixy
voice
crying
vivaciously
oh
laurie
here
comes
mamma
now
she
can
see
mamma
laurie
lynn
turned
toward
the
children
and
saw
a
fair
blue
eyed
woman
coming
up
to
them
she
gazed
in
silence
a
moment
then
gave
a
great
strangling
gasp
of
surprise
and
recognition
it
was
beatrix
wentworth
the
past
rushed
bleakly
over
laurel
memory
the
past
with
all
its
love
and
sorrow
and
shame
the
sight
of
this
fair
woman
brought
it
all
back
freshly
and
with
terrible
realism
she
stood
like
one
turned
to
stone
as
wentworth
came
up
to
her
a
look
of
startled
wonder
on
her
lovely
blonde
face
laurel
vane
she
cried
and
put
out
both
her
hands
laurel
drew
back
coldly
all
her
returning
you
have
made
a
mistake
she
said
i
am
mrs
lynn
wentworth
colored
deeply
i
beg
your
pardon
you
are
right
she
said
i
was
so
startled
by
your
likeness
to
my
friend
that
i
forgot
for
the
moment
that
she
by
whose
name
i
called
you
is
long
since
numbered
with
the
dead
i
regret
to
have
awakened
unpleasant
emotions
in
your
mind
said
laurel
gently
as
she
offered
her
card
to
wentworth
you
are
little
trixy
mother
she
went
on
smiling
i
am
very
glad
to
know
you
for
her
sake
she
and
my
little
son
are
great
friends
you
have
a
son
said
wentworth
as
she
exchanged
cards
with
laurel
she
sighed
heavily
and
then
laurel
noticed
that
she
wore
a
black
dress
ah
i
had
a
son
too
lynn
a
beautiful
boy
that
would
be
as
old
now
as
yours
had
he
lived
but
he
lies
buried
in
an
english
graveyard
you
are
english
asked
laurel
gently
her
heart
melting
in
sympathy
with
the
tear
that
sparkled
down
beatrix
cheek
no
i
am
american
but
i
have
lived
in
england
ever
since
my
marriage
nine
years
ago
little
trixy
was
born
in
london
as
also
my
little
cyril
dead
three
years
ago
we
have
come
home
now
to
live
we
said
lynn
with
a
slight
interrogative
accent
on
the
pronoun
i
should
have
said
wentworth
and
myself
and
trixy
there
are
only
three
of
us
explained
beatrix
pensively
and
smothering
a
sigh
laurel
wondered
to
herself
whether
the
gordons
had
ever
forgiven
their
daughter
she
wondered
what
had
become
of
smart
pretty
clarice
wells
but
she
could
not
ask
any
of
these
questions
that
filled
her
thoughts
because
she
had
decided
that
she
in
her
own
proper
identity
would
remain
as
dead
to
wentworth
as
she
was
to
the
rest
of
the
world
they
stood
there
side
by
side
the
two
fair
women
who
had
so
greatly
influenced
each
other
lives
and
gazed
pensively
at
the
waves
trying
to
put
away
the
thoughts
of
the
past
that
each
recalled
to
the
other
and
to
recall
themselves
to
the
present
i
have
read
your
books
lynn
said
beatrix
i
think
they
are
among
the
most
beautiful
in
the
language
i
am
proud
of
you
as
an
american
author
you
praise
my
poor
efforts
too
highly
laurel
said
with
her
slow
smile
i
do
not
think
so
the
critics
agree
with
me
at
least
said
beatrix
do
you
not
find
it
very
pleasant
to
be
laurel
crowned
lynn
to
win
the
applause
of
the
world
and
own
a
name
that
will
live
beyond
the
grave
to
be
that
a
world
regret
would
seek
us
where
we
lie
quoted
lynn
with
a
slight
sad
smile
ah
wentworth
will
you
believe
that
i
have
scarcely
ever
regarded
the
subject
from
that
point
of
view
when
i
first
took
up
literary
work
it
was
to
win
bread
for
my
little
child
since
success
has
crowned
my
efforts
since
hard
necessity
drives
me
no
longer
i
labor
on
because
i
have
need
to
fill
an
empty
void
in
my
life
from
first
to
last
i
have
had
no
thought
of
fame
the
soft
sigh
of
the
waves
blending
with
her
voice
made
it
sound
very
sad
wentworth
looked
at
the
beautiful
proud
face
curiously
some
kind
of
a
history
was
written
on
it
there
was
a
lingering
shadow
in
the
somber
dark
eyes
a
sorrowful
gravity
about
the
lovely
crimson
lips
she
wondered
what
that
empty
void
might
be
and
then
she
remembered
that
she
had
heard
that
lynn
was
a
widow
it
is
grief
for
her
husband
said
beatrix
to
herself
i
suppose
we
all
have
something
in
our
lives
that
we
are
glad
to
forget
in
the
oblivion
of
hard
work
or
even
in
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
she
said
my
little
cyril
death
left
an
aching
void
in
my
own
heart
and
i
have
another
sorrow
too
i
have
been
a
disobedient
child
to
my
parents
i
never
fully
appreciated
the
enormity
of
my
unpardonable
fault
until
i
had
a
little
daughter
of
my
own
beatrix
spoke
in
a
tone
of
dreamy
sadness
she
did
not
seem
to
be
speaking
to
a
stranger
but
rather
to
a
friend
the
subtle
likeness
between
lynn
and
laurel
vane
affected
her
strangely
laurel
caught
at
her
words
quickly
your
unpardoned
fault
she
echoed
do
you
mean
to
say
that
your
parents
never
forgave
your
disobedience
mrs
wentworth
never
beatrix
answered
with
a
sigh
that
showed
how
deep
her
pain
lay
then
they
were
silent
for
a
time
the
idle
loiterers
on
the
beach
the
casual
passers
by
turned
twice
to
look
at
the
two
fair
women
so
beautiful
so
unlike
in
their
beauty
beatrix
so
with
her
large
blue
eyes
and
tresses
laurel
with
her
rare
unusual
type
of
beauty
her
dark
eyes
her
blonde
skin
her
burnished
hair
the
one
in
her
dress
of
deep
lusterless
black
silk
the
other
in
something
white
and
soft
and
clinging
marvelously
becoming
to
her
graceful
style
shall
you
be
long
at
the
seaside
laurel
inquired
presently
a
few
weeks
that
is
all
beatrix
replied
wentworth
is
in
new
york
business
you
know
lynn
trixy
and
i
can
not
stay
long
away
from
him
you
are
fond
of
him
said
laurel
turning
her
large
wistful
eyes
on
the
other
tender
face
the
tenderness
deepened
in
wentworth
sweet
blue
eyes
and
around
her
gentle
lips
you
would
think
so
if
you
knew
the
story
of
our
marriage
she
said
ours
was
a
real
lynn
it
was
most
romantic
some
day
when
i
know
you
better
i
will
tell
it
to
you
it
would
furnish
you
a
plot
for
a
novel
laurel
turned
her
head
aside
and
set
her
lips
in
a
tense
hard
line
she
remembered
how
the
story
had
been
told
her
a
few
weeks
ago
in
that
green
city
of
the
dead
beside
the
grave
where
the
unknown
waif
lay
under
the
name
of
laurel
le
roy
god
forbid
that
i
should
have
to
hear
the
story
told
again
she
murmured
to
herself
she
looked
back
at
wentworth
and
said
calmly
and
even
smilingly
it
is
very
pleasant
to
hear
of
a
real
in
real
life
i
suppose
you
are
very
happy
mrs
wentworth
yes
i
am
very
happy
with
my
noble
husband
beatrix
said
thoughtfully
but
my
happiness
was
purchased
at
a
bitter
cost
to
another
i
know
what
it
is
to
feel
the
sharp
sting
of
remorse
mrs
lynn
little
trixy
came
up
with
a
beautiful
shell
and
claimed
her
attention
they
went
away
together
presently
and
left
laurel
to
her
own
reflections
they
were
very
sweet
and
noble
ones
she
was
thinking
of
the
gordons
longing
to
reconcile
them
to
their
daughter
and
her
husband
i
am
glad
that
she
is
happy
with
her
husband
mused
laurel
oh
how
differently
our
girlish
conspiracy
resulted
for
her
and
for
me
and
yet
would
i
change
places
with
her
no
hers
be
the
pleasure
mine
the
pain
she
walked
slowly
back
to
the
hotel
leaving
laurie
at
play
with
his
nurse
on
the
beach
in
the
hotel
corridor
she
encountered
some
new
arrivals
ladies
and
gentlemen
going
to
their
rooms
quite
oblivious
of
their
interested
admiring
stare
she
passed
on
and
took
no
note
of
the
pretty
painted
blonde
face
that
whitened
beneath
all
her
rouge
as
she
stared
aghast
and
murmured
huskily
is
it
laurel
vane
or
her
ghost
i
never
saw
such
a
terrible
likeness
chapter
lix
was
it
chance
or
fate
that
brought
gordon
down
a
few
weeks
later
to
consult
with
lynn
about
the
publication
of
her
new
book
she
was
down
on
the
shore
with
her
little
laurence
and
his
playmate
trixy
wentworth
the
little
girl
mother
had
promised
to
join
her
presently
she
and
lynn
had
become
quite
intimate
friends
by
this
time
they
were
fond
of
each
other
as
two
young
pretty
noble
women
like
beatrix
and
laurel
are
apt
to
be
when
thrown
together
beatrix
had
told
all
her
romantic
story
to
lynn
and
laurel
had
heard
it
silently
and
made
no
sign
she
said
to
herself
that
that
unhappy
girl
over
whose
fate
beatrix
drowned
her
blue
eyes
in
regretful
tears
must
remain
as
one
dead
to
all
the
world
she
would
not
confess
her
secret
she
would
remain
lynn
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
she
sat
still
on
her
low
with
her
large
parasol
held
open
over
her
head
and
waited
for
beatrix
to
come
she
had
a
book
open
in
her
lap
but
she
was
not
reading
her
large
dark
thoughtful
eyes
wandered
from
the
pretty
children
at
play
with
their
attentive
nurses
to
the
billowy
foam
capped
waves
rolling
in
to
her
feet
with
a
hollow
mystical
murmur
full
of
woe
and
mystery
gordon
came
out
to
her
there
and
he
was
puzzled
as
he
always
was
when
he
saw
lynn
by
her
subtle
likeness
to
some
one
he
had
seen
or
known
and
whom
he
could
not
now
recall
have
i
ever
told
you
how
strangely
you
affect
me
mrs
lynn
he
said
you
are
like
some
one
i
have
known
whom
i
can
not
now
recall
if
i
could
bring
myself
to
believe
in
theories
i
have
heard
advanced
i
should
say
i
had
known
you
in
some
other
previous
world
she
knew
where
he
had
seen
her
it
was
at
eden
that
fatal
night
that
had
struck
her
down
from
happiness
to
the
keenest
despair
her
face
grew
pale
her
limbs
trembled
beneath
her
some
day
the
truth
will
break
upon
him
with
the
suddenness
of
the
lightning
flash
he
will
recognize
me
as
laurel
vane
the
girl
he
refused
to
forgive
and
pity
that
fatal
night
he
will
know
that
the
scorn
of
proud
rich
people
did
not
quite
crush
me
that
i
survived
it
all
she
said
to
herself
with
the
pride
that
had
become
a
part
of
her
nature
but
she
did
not
mean
that
he
should
recognize
her
if
she
could
help
it
certainly
she
would
never
own
the
truth
even
if
he
taxed
her
with
it
so
she
answered
with
a
careless
smile
the
world
is
full
of
chance
resemblances
that
puzzle
and
amaze
us
gordon
you
see
that
little
girl
playing
with
my
son
there
well
when
i
first
saw
her
i
had
the
oddest
fancy
that
she
was
like
some
one
i
had
seen
or
known
the
likeness
was
haunting
and
troublesome
at
first
but
i
have
grown
used
to
it
now
it
does
not
trouble
me
any
longer
do
look
at
her
gordon
is
she
not
a
lovely
child
he
looked
and
a
sudden
cry
of
wonder
came
from
his
lips
the
years
rolled
backward
and
in
the
face
of
little
trixy
he
seemed
to
see
his
own
beatrix
in
her
tender
childhood
his
beautiful
beloved
daughter
who
had
been
so
willful
and
disobedient
and
to
whose
sin
he
had
refused
his
forgiveness
she
is
like
some
one
i
have
known
too
ah
so
like
so
like
he
said
in
a
strange
voice
who
is
she
miss
lynn
her
name
is
trixy
wentworth
gordon
she
is
an
american
child
but
she
was
born
in
england
her
parents
lived
there
nearly
nine
years
they
have
come
back
to
new
york
to
live
now
cyril
wentworth
is
in
business
there
trixy
is
here
with
her
mother
for
her
health
he
stifled
something
like
a
groan
upon
his
lips
laurel
saw
how
pale
he
had
suddenly
grown
and
followed
up
her
advantage
by
calling
the
little
one
to
her
and
setting
her
on
gordon
knee
give
the
gentleman
a
kiss
trixy
she
said
to
the
lovely
little
creature
he
is
very
lonely
he
has
no
little
girl
of
his
own
trixy
ready
sympathies
were
instantly
enlisted
by
that
to
her
mind
pathetic
statement
she
gave
gordon
a
fastidious
stare
and
seeing
that
he
was
pleasant
to
look
upon
put
her
round
dimpled
arms
about
his
neck
and
gave
him
a
hug
and
a
resounding
kiss
is
it
true
that
you
really
have
no
little
girl
she
asked
him
bending
back
her
pretty
head
to
look
into
his
face
with
eyes
that
pierced
his
heart
with
their
likeness
to
beatrix
beatrix
his
little
girl
whom
he
had
put
away
from
his
heart
hated
and
unforgiven
because
she
had
disobeyed
him
he
could
not
speak
for
a
moment
and
lynn
said
gently
looking
away
at
the
restless
sea
the
while
this
little
girl
has
a
grandpapa
in
new
york
gordon
who
has
never
seen
her
her
mother
made
a
marriage
that
displeased
him
and
he
has
never
forgiven
her
he
has
missed
a
world
of
love
by
his
hardness
and
sternness
do
you
not
think
so
the
little
laurence
came
running
up
before
he
could
frame
a
reply
oh
but
trixy
you
should
be
sitting
on
that
gentleman
lap
you
know
he
exclaimed
for
you
have
promised
to
be
my
little
wife
this
childish
jealousy
provoked
such
a
laugh
from
the
elders
that
it
quite
drowned
the
sound
of
a
light
quick
step
that
came
up
behind
them
in
a
moment
more
beatrix
wentworth
came
around
in
front
of
the
group
the
smile
died
on
her
lips
as
she
saw
her
little
daughter
sitting
on
the
lap
of
the
stern
father
she
had
not
beheld
for
more
than
nine
years
poor
beatrix
looked
frightened
and
dismayed
the
pretty
faded
from
her
face
her
lips
trembled
and
the
words
she
strove
to
utter
died
silently
upon
them
laurel
rose
with
an
encouraging
smile
and
drew
her
friend
forward
gordon
she
said
this
is
my
friend
wentworth
she
is
little
trixy
mother
beatrix
looked
upon
into
the
face
of
her
father
through
blinding
tears
and
put
out
her
hand
papa
forgive
me
she
murmured
sadly
there
was
a
moment
dead
silence
gordon
had
put
the
child
from
his
knee
and
risen
but
he
did
not
answer
his
daughter
she
went
on
in
gentle
pleading
tones
papa
i
have
written
to
you
so
often
and
begged
you
to
forgive
me
and
every
time
my
letters
came
back
to
me
unopened
papa
i
can
not
say
i
am
sorry
for
my
fault
because
cyril
is
good
and
kind
and
he
makes
me
very
happy
but
i
have
grieved
sorely
for
you
and
mamma
i
have
longed
to
be
reconciled
to
you
oh
surely
you
will
not
refuse
to
forgive
me
now
that
we
are
face
to
face
forgive
her
gordon
cried
laurel
impulsively
the
two
fair
faces
the
pleading
voices
the
wondering
eyes
of
the
little
children
were
too
much
for
gordon
calmness
his
pride
and
sternness
melted
into
love
and
remorse
laurel
gave
one
glance
at
his
quivering
face
and
turned
gently
away
she
knew
that
the
end
was
won
that
love
had
conquered
pride
he
would
forgive
beatrix
but
she
did
not
know
that
in
this
moment
when
the
ice
melted
around
his
hard
cold
heart
and
he
forgave
his
disobedient
daughter
new
light
had
broken
upon
his
mind
the
sight
of
beatrix
had
supplied
the
missing
link
that
connected
lynn
so
subtly
with
his
past
like
a
flash
of
lightning
it
dawned
upon
him
that
this
was
laurel
vane
that
night
at
eden
rushed
over
his
mind
freshly
as
though
it
were
but
yesterday
he
saw
again
the
beautiful
impostor
who
had
personated
his
own
daughter
and
married
the
master
of
eden
while
he
gave
beatrix
the
tender
embrace
of
forgiveness
he
seemed
to
see
in
fancy
the
kneeling
suppliant
girl
to
whom
he
had
refused
his
forgiveness
whom
no
one
had
pitied
whom
all
had
forsaken
and
ignored
even
in
his
anger
that
night
he
had
been
struck
by
the
wondrous
beauty
of
the
girl
this
was
the
same
lovely
face
with
its
charm
only
intensified
by
time
this
was
the
same
sweet
voice
asking
him
to
pardon
beatrix
that
had
begged
forgiveness
vainly
for
herself
he
was
full
of
wonder
over
his
sudden
discovery
they
said
that
le
roy
wife
drowned
herself
but
it
can
not
be
true
there
is
some
terrible
mistake
some
unexplained
mystery
this
is
louis
vane
daughter
and
she
has
inherited
all
the
genius
of
her
erratic
father
he
said
to
himself
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
he
was
frightened
at
his
own
discovery
he
wondered
if
beatrix
knew
the
truth
he
inclined
to
believe
that
she
did
but
when
he
found
an
opportunity
and
questioned
her
he
was
rather
staggered
to
find
that
lynn
had
resolutely
denied
her
identity
with
laurel
vane
i
do
not
believe
her
she
is
leon
le
roy
wife
and
the
child
is
his
it
bears
its
paternity
on
its
face
what
is
your
opinion
beatrix
asked
the
great
publisher
thoughtfully
i
believe
that
you
are
right
she
replied
i
have
believed
that
she
was
mr
le
roy
wife
ever
since
i
first
met
her
several
weeks
ago
her
assertions
to
the
contrary
had
no
weight
with
me
although
i
held
my
peace
and
respected
her
reserve
i
have
been
silent
but
i
have
not
been
convinced
what
is
her
object
in
this
strange
denial
of
herself
he
asked
thoughtfully
pride
and
wounded
feeling
beatrix
answered
with
the
unerring
instinct
of
a
woman
when
he
remembered
that
night
long
years
ago
he
did
not
blame
her
much
they
had
scorned
and
flouted
her
cruelly
among
them
they
had
no
pity
on
the
erring
girl
they
had
driven
her
to
desperation
forgetting
how
young
and
friendless
she
had
been
he
wondered
much
what
had
been
the
history
of
the
intervening
years
and
how
she
had
come
by
her
name
of
lynn
only
her
de
perhaps
he
thought
and
then
he
said
aloud
beatrix
do
you
not
think
i
ought
to
write
to
leon
le
roy
to
come
down
here
i
think
it
would
be
perfectly
proper
she
replied
chapter
lx
wentworth
and
gordon
were
not
the
only
persons
at
the
seaside
who
suspected
that
lynn
was
other
than
she
seemed
the
curiosity
of
the
pretty
faded
widow
merivale
had
been
aroused
by
the
first
sight
of
lynn
she
spared
no
pains
until
she
obtained
an
introduction
to
the
noted
writer
over
whose
charms
of
mind
and
person
all
the
best
people
at
the
seaside
were
enthusiastic
in
admiration
when
she
had
done
so
she
was
almost
frightened
by
the
astonishing
likeness
of
lynn
to
laurel
vane
it
is
the
dead
alive
she
said
to
herself
i
can
no
longer
believe
that
leon
wife
drowned
herself
there
has
been
some
great
mistake
she
went
away
and
hid
herself
from
all
who
knew
her
and
she
has
reappeared
as
lynn
i
wish
i
knew
the
history
of
those
intervening
years
and
what
she
intends
to
do
will
she
return
to
leon
will
he
forgive
her
and
take
her
back
she
was
bitterly
chagrined
and
angry
at
the
thought
that
laurel
lived
in
the
person
of
the
beautiful
gifted
wealthy
lynn
she
had
been
glad
when
she
heard
that
laurel
was
dead
she
began
to
feel
now
that
fate
had
played
her
an
unkind
trick
in
resurrecting
her
hated
rival
from
the
grave
where
she
had
deemed
her
resting
all
these
long
years
not
that
the
wily
widow
had
any
hope
of
winning
leon
she
had
understood
that
long
ago
she
knew
that
he
was
proof
against
her
faded
charms
her
rouged
and
powdered
beauty
that
he
thoroughly
despised
her
she
had
known
it
ever
since
that
night
at
eden
when
he
had
flung
back
her
offered
heart
on
her
hands
in
supremest
scorn
and
sarcasm
the
knowledge
had
aroused
all
the
littleness
and
spite
of
her
malicious
nature
she
had
hated
leon
from
that
moment
hated
the
beautiful
girl
who
had
won
him
even
more
she
would
gladly
have
done
both
an
ill
turn
if
she
could
but
laurel
dead
in
her
grave
was
secure
from
her
vengeance
and
leon
in
his
proud
position
and
calm
reserve
beyond
her
reach
for
several
years
she
had
not
seen
him
but
she
knew
that
he
had
returned
from
his
wanderings
and
was
at
home
again
the
thought
that
laurel
still
lived
the
bare
possibility
that
she
might
yet
be
reunited
to
her
husband
filled
her
with
jealous
anger
and
dread
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
she
penned
a
letter
to
one
who
hated
leon
and
laurel
with
as
deadly
a
rancor
as
her
own
one
whose
love
for
laurel
had
changed
to
hate
even
as
had
merivale
for
leon
no
less
a
person
than
the
villain
ross
powell
powell
animosity
against
the
rich
man
who
had
won
laurel
had
not
been
lessened
by
the
fact
that
mr
le
roy
had
secured
the
dismissal
of
the
villain
from
gordon
employ
in
the
week
immediately
following
the
at
eden
mr
le
roy
resentment
had
followed
him
steadily
from
one
place
to
another
in
new
york
until
he
found
that
it
was
useless
to
expect
to
retain
employment
in
that
city
and
was
forced
to
seek
a
livelihood
in
a
more
distant
one
beyond
the
reach
of
his
anger
the
villain
was
well
punished
for
his
unmanly
persecution
of
an
innocent
helpless
girl
but
it
did
not
add
to
the
sweetness
of
his
temper
to
receive
this
merited
retribution
for
his
wickedness
he
swore
revenge
upon
leon
le
roy
and
patiently
bided
his
time
pledging
himself
the
faithful
ally
of
merivale
in
her
hatred
of
her
whilom
friend
and
lover
the
time
for
his
revenge
seemed
come
at
last
when
he
received
merivale
letter
urging
him
to
come
to
the
seaside
and
help
her
to
identify
laurel
vane
in
the
beautiful
courted
woman
queening
it
so
royally
in
circles
where
maud
merivale
could
barely
find
a
footing
he
lost
no
time
in
obeying
her
mandate
feeling
as
anxious
as
the
wicked
widow
herself
to
prevent
a
reunion
of
the
husband
and
wife
he
reached
the
hotel
on
a
lovely
evening
in
the
last
of
august
and
was
shown
at
once
to
merivale
private
parlor
they
had
never
met
but
once
before
but
there
was
no
embarrassment
in
the
meeting
both
were
alike
at
heart
crafty
evil
unscrupulous
ready
to
do
their
best
to
dash
down
the
possible
cup
of
happiness
from
the
lips
of
the
man
and
woman
they
hated
with
all
the
venom
of
their
little
souls
and
you
are
sure
that
she
is
laurel
vane
he
said
in
wonder
i
am
sure
quite
sure
in
my
own
mind
she
replied
but
you
will
see
her
very
probably
this
evening
at
the
usual
hop
if
she
deigns
to
honor
it
with
her
presence
it
is
not
often
she
appears
being
very
exclusive
and
reserved
but
if
you
miss
her
you
will
be
very
sure
to
see
her
on
the
shore
in
the
morning
what
are
we
to
do
if
it
be
really
laurel
vane
asked
powell
musingly
her
pale
eyes
flashed
with
subtle
meaning
we
must
do
anything
to
prevent
her
from
meeting
mr
le
roy
again
i
could
not
endure
their
happiness
she
replied
bitterly
chapter
lxi
contrary
to
her
usual
habit
and
to
humor
a
caprice
of
wentworth
laurel
decided
to
make
her
appearance
in
the
hotel
parlors
that
evening
beatrix
and
her
child
were
going
back
to
new
york
with
gordon
the
next
day
he
had
promised
his
daughter
to
take
her
home
to
her
mother
promised
her
gordon
free
and
full
forgiveness
both
for
herself
and
her
beloved
cyril
beatrix
was
very
happy
in
the
reconciliation
with
her
father
so
happy
that
laurel
could
not
bear
to
cloud
the
brightness
of
her
sky
with
a
single
shadow
so
she
did
not
refuse
when
beatrix
asked
her
to
go
into
the
parlors
with
her
that
evening
papa
wishes
it
said
wentworth
and
cyril
is
coming
too
he
has
read
your
books
and
he
is
very
anxious
to
see
you
he
can
scarcely
credit
my
written
statement
that
you
are
so
young
still
in
spite
of
your
brilliant
literary
fame
he
imagines
you
an
old
lady
in
cap
and
spectacles
laurel
laughed
and
promised
to
be
introduced
to
wentworth
she
had
a
vivid
remembrance
of
the
fair
handsome
young
fellow
who
had
been
so
kind
and
pitiful
to
her
that
day
in
london
when
beatrix
and
clarice
had
so
scolded
and
frightened
her
she
felt
grateful
to
him
still
and
was
not
averse
to
seeing
him
again
herself
unknown
she
chose
an
evening
dress
of
brocade
with
spanish
lace
the
rainbow
fire
of
opals
shone
on
her
arms
and
neck
and
her
beautiful
burnished
golden
hair
was
arranged
on
the
top
of
her
head
in
a
queenly
fashion
though
she
had
scarcely
given
a
thought
to
her
personal
appearance
she
had
never
looked
more
lovely
there
was
not
a
single
woman
at
the
seaside
that
night
who
could
at
all
compare
with
lynn
for
grace
and
beauty
some
one
else
besides
ross
powell
had
arrived
that
evening
no
less
a
person
than
leon
le
roy
he
was
rather
puzzled
to
know
why
gordon
had
sent
him
that
mysterious
summons
but
when
they
met
and
he
frankly
inquired
the
reason
he
received
an
evasive
reply
gordon
promised
to
tell
him
after
awhile
but
just
now
he
had
promised
to
escort
his
daughter
wentworth
into
the
where
the
lively
strains
of
the
band
were
already
in
progress
would
mr
le
roy
see
beatrix
and
forgive
her
for
her
share
in
his
past
trouble
she
was
so
sorry
so
ashamed
she
had
never
dreamed
how
it
would
all
turn
out
the
publisher
was
a
little
nervous
as
he
thus
pleaded
for
his
daughter
she
had
told
her
father
the
story
of
her
unanswered
letter
to
mr
le
roy
he
could
not
tell
whether
time
had
softened
his
resentment
at
the
girl
conspiracy
that
had
ended
so
disastrously
mr
le
roy
grew
very
pale
for
a
moment
as
he
was
thus
brought
face
to
face
with
the
past
then
he
remembered
wentworth
letter
with
something
like
shame
it
had
been
so
kind
and
sweet
and
womanly
so
truly
repentant
i
was
rude
and
churlish
to
slight
it
so
he
said
to
himself
remorsefully
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
her
and
i
hope
she
will
forgive
me
for
my
churlishness
he
said
gordon
conducted
him
to
his
daughter
private
parlor
beatrix
was
there
looking
very
lovely
in
a
simple
of
black
and
white
tears
crowded
thickly
to
her
azure
eyes
as
she
confessed
her
fault
and
begged
him
to
pardon
her
if
i
had
known
that
you
were
at
eden
mr
le
roy
i
should
never
have
sent
poor
little
laurel
there
said
beatrix
i
was
a
young
and
silly
girl
enough
i
own
but
i
should
have
been
too
wise
to
have
sent
that
lovely
ignorant
child
into
the
way
of
temptation
that
lovely
ignorant
child
somehow
those
words
seemed
like
a
tacit
reproach
to
him
yes
that
was
what
she
had
been
a
beautiful
simple
child
all
unversed
in
the
world
ways
ignorant
of
the
enormity
of
her
fault
or
believing
that
her
great
love
condoned
it
how
hardly
how
cruelly
he
had
judged
her
the
he
had
taken
before
god
for
better
for
worse
i
have
not
kept
my
vow
he
said
to
himself
and
beatrix
who
thought
him
hard
and
stern
wondered
at
the
softness
of
his
voice
as
he
replied
i
forgive
you
freely
wentworth
and
indeed
i
sometimes
wonder
if
there
is
anything
to
forgive
my
wife
made
me
very
happy
i
erred
when
in
my
hardness
i
refused
to
forgive
her
but
for
my
hard
suspicious
nature
that
made
me
impute
mercenary
motives
to
her
i
should
have
pardoned
the
child
fault
but
i
was
cruelly
hard
it
is
no
wonder
she
refuses
to
forgive
me
refuses
beatrix
echoed
with
a
start
of
wonder
as
she
gazed
into
his
pale
agitated
face
i
spoke
in
the
present
tense
as
if
laurel
really
existed
a
mere
slip
of
the
tongue
wentworth
he
said
with
assumed
carelessness
ah
if
only
he
knew
the
real
truth
but
i
can
see
that
he
is
deeply
repentant
and
i
foresee
a
joyful
reconciliation
between
him
and
his
beautiful
gifted
wife
said
beatrix
to
herself
hopefully
in
a
little
while
cyril
wentworth
came
in
it
was
but
a
distant
greeting
the
two
gentlemen
gave
each
other
cyril
thought
that
mr
le
roy
had
treated
his
erring
bride
hardly
and
unjustly
and
he
could
not
be
cordial
to
him
for
pretty
laurel
sake
and
on
the
other
hand
leon
remembered
how
jealous
he
had
been
of
this
handsome
young
man
in
the
days
before
he
learned
the
truth
about
his
wife
the
old
dislike
and
resentment
lingered
with
him
unconsciously
still
he
took
leave
very
soon
after
cyril
entrance
promising
to
meet
them
later
in
the
or
the
parlors
now
i
am
going
to
introduce
you
to
lynn
said
beatrix
to
her
husband
you
will
escort
her
to
the
and
papa
will
take
me
she
led
him
to
laurel
apartment
and
watched
him
closely
as
he
bowed
before
the
gifted
authoress
whose
writings
he
admired
so
much
cyril
was
almost
dumb
with
surprise
and
admiration
it
was
some
time
before
he
recovered
himself
sufficiently
to
offer
her
his
arm
to
conduct
her
to
the
well
cyril
what
do
you
think
of
her
beatrix
asked
him
eagerly
as
soon
as
she
found
a
chance
to
hang
upon
his
arm
apart
from
the
rest
he
looked
fondly
down
into
the
fair
face
you
must
not
be
jealous
of
my
opinion
my
darling
he
said
of
course
you
are
the
sweetest
fairest
woman
on
earth
to
me
but
lynn
is
the
most
beautiful
as
well
as
the
most
gifted
one
i
ever
met
it
was
eloquent
praise
but
somehow
beatrix
looked
disappointed
he
read
it
plainly
on
the
fair
mobile
face
is
there
anything
more
that
i
ought
to
say
about
your
favorite
he
inquired
laughingly
have
you
indeed
no
more
to
say
about
her
she
returned
wistfully
yes
there
is
something
else
only
i
am
afraid
you
will
laugh
at
the
fancy
dear
said
cyril
wentworth
with
a
masculine
dread
of
ridicule
no
i
will
not
laugh
at
you
tell
me
said
beatrix
anxiously
i
am
not
at
all
sure
you
will
not
laugh
he
said
but
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
although
i
have
never
seen
any
one
quite
so
lovely
as
your
lynn
yet
she
recalls
to
my
mind
some
one
else
whom
i
have
met
indeed
beatrix
the
resemblance
is
simply
marvelous
he
exclaimed
glancing
across
to
where
the
lovely
authoress
stood
conversing
with
gordon
whom
does
she
resemble
beatrix
inquired
with
her
heart
on
her
lips
i
am
sure
you
will
see
the
likeness
as
soon
as
i
mention
it
he
said
look
closely
at
lynn
beatrix
at
her
rare
type
of
beauty
her
dark
eyes
her
golden
hair
her
blonde
coloring
her
delicately
chiseled
features
her
sweet
sad
lips
she
is
like
one
long
dead
she
is
like
laurel
vane
a
sigh
of
relief
came
from
her
lips
i
was
sure
you
could
not
fail
to
see
the
resemblance
she
said
so
you
had
already
noted
it
he
said
could
one
help
it
she
whispered
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
cyril
i
believe
that
this
is
laurel
vane
herself
but
she
is
dead
cyril
objected
dazed
by
the
suddenness
of
his
wife
revelation
i
do
not
believe
it
there
has
been
some
dreadful
mistake
i
believe
that
leon
le
roy
wife
lives
in
the
person
of
lynn
exclaimed
beatrix
whispering
to
him
earnestly
for
a
few
minutes
laurel
and
gordon
together
with
ford
stood
a
little
apart
watching
the
gay
crowd
of
waltzers
whirling
down
the
center
of
the
long
room
to
the
measured
beat
of
the
gay
dance
music
she
did
not
know
why
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
in
another
direction
but
it
must
have
been
in
magnetic
obedience
to
an
evil
spell
for
in
a
moment
she
met
the
glance
of
maud
merivale
maud
standing
near
and
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
man
who
regarded
her
with
bold
and
eager
eyes
to
have
saved
her
life
laurel
could
not
have
repressed
that
agitated
start
that
tremor
that
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
at
sight
of
her
old
enemy
face
she
had
been
proof
against
the
softness
of
love
the
allurements
of
friendship
but
in
that
instant
the
deadly
influence
of
fear
and
detestation
sent
a
shudder
through
her
frame
and
blanched
her
lovely
face
to
the
pallor
of
death
it
seemed
as
though
she
was
possessed
by
some
horrible
nightmare
dream
as
she
met
those
bold
evil
eyes
and
realized
he
recognized
her
as
laurel
vane
whom
he
had
so
relentlessly
pursued
with
his
evil
designs
with
a
terrible
effort
she
turned
her
eyes
from
the
villain
exultant
face
and
they
rested
by
chance
on
beatrix
where
she
stood
leaning
on
her
husband
arm
but
whose
was
that
other
form
beside
beatrix
that
tall
and
stately
presence
she
gave
a
great
gasp
of
blended
emotion
leon
le
roy
chapter
lxii
leon
le
roy
what
had
brought
him
here
at
this
moment
of
all
others
what
strange
trick
did
fate
mean
to
play
her
in
thus
surrounding
her
all
in
a
moment
as
it
were
with
these
people
who
had
had
so
malign
an
influence
upon
her
past
her
heart
beat
with
deadly
fear
one
white
ringed
hand
furtively
sought
her
uncle
arm
and
clung
to
it
as
if
to
save
herself
from
falling
to
the
floor
through
the
wild
rhythm
of
the
dance
music
through
the
measured
echo
of
the
flying
feet
of
the
waltzers
she
instinctively
felt
him
pausing
before
her
she
heard
wentworth
voice
saying
with
a
strange
sweet
ring
in
it
mr
le
roy
this
is
my
dear
friend
mrs
lynn
laurel
could
not
speak
for
a
moment
a
deadly
fear
possessed
her
she
heard
a
clear
calm
voice
saying
kindly
lynn
and
i
have
met
before
we
are
neighbors
at
our
homes
on
the
hudson
she
did
not
look
up
but
she
saw
his
strong
shapely
white
hand
held
out
to
her
and
as
she
laid
her
own
within
it
his
gentle
pressure
seemed
to
say
dumbly
do
not
be
afraid
dear
they
shall
not
surprise
me
into
betraying
your
strange
secret
laurel
could
not
speak
for
a
moment
happily
beatrix
broke
the
silence
by
exclaiming
in
a
voice
from
which
she
could
not
keep
the
ring
of
disappointment
neighbors
and
acquaintances
and
i
did
not
dream
that
you
had
met
before
the
whole
fabric
of
the
pretty
romance
she
had
been
building
up
was
destroyed
in
a
moment
like
the
baseless
fabric
of
a
dream
she
felt
like
bursting
into
tears
of
disappointment
what
beautiful
hopes
she
had
built
upon
lynn
resemblance
to
laurel
vane
and
oh
if
mr
le
roy
and
the
novelist
could
guess
how
she
and
her
father
had
plotted
to
bring
them
together
how
angry
they
would
be
while
these
vexatious
thoughts
rushed
over
her
she
heard
lynn
saying
in
a
cool
calm
almost
indifferent
voice
yes
wentworth
my
uncle
home
on
the
hudson
adjoins
eden
while
we
sojourned
there
this
summer
we
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
mr
le
roy
and
his
mother
and
in
the
next
breath
mr
le
roy
said
suavely
will
you
give
me
this
waltz
mrs
lynn
she
laid
her
gloved
hand
on
his
arm
and
they
were
whirled
away
to
the
rhythm
of
the
delicious
waltz
music
who
could
tell
how
quickly
laurel
heart
beat
as
she
felt
her
true
love
arm
round
her
once
again
beatrix
with
her
father
and
husband
stood
gazing
a
little
blankly
at
the
graceful
forms
of
the
handsome
pair
all
three
were
bitterly
disappointed
at
the
prosaic
ending
of
the
pretty
romance
they
had
built
up
and
of
which
they
had
confidently
expected
to
behold
the
delightful
but
the
most
amazed
of
all
were
merivale
and
her
coadjutor
in
malice
ross
powell
they
had
stood
near
enough
to
witness
the
meeting
between
mr
le
roy
and
lynn
and
while
filled
with
rage
at
the
sight
they
had
been
utterly
confounded
at
the
result
mr
le
roy
cool
declaration
we
have
met
before
apparent
calmness
and
astounded
them
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
in
wonder
and
amaze
and
ross
powell
asked
hoarsely
what
does
it
mean
what
indeed
she
echoed
is
the
man
blind
or
are
they
acting
a
part
he
seized
upon
the
idea
quickly
they
acting
a
part
he
said
i
could
swear
that
lynn
is
laurel
vane
and
of
course
her
own
husband
could
not
be
deceived
in
her
identity
decidedly
they
are
playing
a
part
but
why
have
you
any
idea
i
can
not
imagine
she
replied
and
yet
i
would
have
the
world
to
know
is
he
still
angry
with
her
is
it
possible
he
can
recognize
her
and
not
choose
to
claim
her
is
it
possible
that
he
is
mad
he
asked
contemptuously
no
there
is
something
deeper
than
that
behind
their
masquerading
why
she
is
simply
peerless
what
man
in
his
senses
could
behold
her
and
not
claim
her
knowing
her
his
the
yearning
in
his
voice
made
her
bitterly
angry
how
she
hated
that
beauty
that
made
men
mad
for
her
sake
that
skin
those
great
eyes
that
golden
hair
that
fire
and
soul
that
made
lynn
so
peerless
doubly
crowned
doubly
laureled
by
both
beauty
and
intellect
i
thought
you
hated
her
she
said
scornfully
so
i
do
i
hate
her
and
i
love
her
in
the
same
breath
can
you
understand
the
feeling
he
asked
hoarsely
and
almost
under
his
breath
yes
i
understand
she
answered
with
subdued
bitterness
the
first
sight
of
her
lovely
face
stirred
all
the
old
passion
within
me
and
yet
i
hate
her
too
he
said
darkly
i
can
not
bear
that
that
aristocrat
should
win
her
back
i
could
sooner
bear
to
strike
her
dead
at
his
feet
than
to
see
them
happy
together
he
stood
glowering
at
the
graceful
figure
as
it
whirled
down
the
long
in
the
clasp
of
leon
le
roy
arm
all
the
worst
passions
of
his
nature
were
roused
by
the
sight
the
first
sight
of
laurel
in
all
her
womanly
beauty
had
kindled
anew
the
fires
of
his
passion
for
her
while
his
resentment
at
her
scorn
burned
to
fever
heat
he
had
spoken
the
truth
when
he
said
that
he
hated
and
loved
her
in
the
same
breath
merivale
gazed
at
him
with
quickened
breath
and
evilly
flashing
eyes
she
had
set
herself
the
deliberate
task
of
arousing
all
the
worst
instincts
of
this
wicked
and
undisciplined
nature
through
ross
powell
she
would
have
her
revenge
on
those
two
whom
she
hated
he
was
the
blind
instrument
in
her
hands
to
work
out
her
wicked
will
i
do
not
blame
you
powell
she
said
in
a
tone
of
gentlest
sympathy
i
know
that
men
feel
deeply
and
strongly
on
such
subjects
and
i
can
imagine
what
it
must
be
to
see
the
woman
one
loves
beloved
by
another
man
and
loving
him
in
return
it
must
almost
drive
one
to
madness
it
must
be
the
refinement
of
torture
it
is
hell
he
muttered
back
hoarsely
and
with
concentrated
bitterness
and
despair
it
would
be
easier
to
see
her
dead
i
fancy
pursued
the
wily
tempter

a
grim
bridegroom
but
better
the
gloom
of
the
grave
than

he
muttered
i
hate
them
both
and
i
swear
they
shall
not
be
happy

there
any

answered

slipped
out

said
we
all
know
the
romantic
softening
influences
of
moonlight

and
love
they
will
no
longer
be
able
to
keep
up

will

half
maddened
by

he
ground
his
teeth
over
a
fierce
and
bitter
oath
and
shaking
her
hand
from
his
arm
strode
out
of
the
room
with
the
fires
of

in
his
heart
chapter
lxiii
mr
le
roy
and
laurel
had
indeed
gone
out
upon
the
shore
he
had
invited
her
to
do
so
and
she
had
complied
for
she
was
full
of
wonder
as
to
what
had
brought
him
there
she
was
frightened
too
when
she
found
herself
surrounded
by
all
those
people
who
belonged
to
her
past
she
asked
herself
if
it
could
have
happened
by
simple
chance
she
was
frightened
she
felt
like
some
hunted
creature
brought
to
bay
she
tried
to
shake
off
her
feelings
of
mingled
terror
and
annoyance
bravely
assuring
herself
that
there
existed
no
cause
for
them
i
have
done
nothing
these
people
have
naught
to
do
with
me
i
am
foolish
to
feel
afraid
when
i
see
them
all
around
me
she
repeated
to
herself
when
she
tried
to
analyze
her
feelings
she
found
that
it
was
only
ross
powell
who
inspired
her
with
such
terror
she
was
not
afraid
of
merivale
she
simply
despised
her
and
secure
in
her
fancied
she
did
not
feel
apprehensive
concerning
the
desire
of
the
jealous
woman
to
work
her
ill
it
was
only
powell
of
whom
she
felt
afraid
his
evil
exultant
glance
had
assured
her
that
he
knew
her
and
she
had
already
had
evidence
of
his
willingness
to
destroy
every
hope
of
her
life
so
far
as
lay
in
his
power
it
was
wholly
through
dread
of
his
haunting
glance
that
she
accepted
mr
le
roy
invitation
to
leave
the
crowded
and
go
out
upon
the
shore
and
once
away
from
the
baleful
presence
of
the
enemy
she
feared
and
dreaded
she
dismissed
him
wholly
from
her
thoughts
and
gave
herself
up
to
the
secret
trembling
joy
of
leon
presence
her
heart
was
a
traitor
to
her
will
it
exulted
in
his
nearness
despite
her
reason
that
told
her
they
were
better
apart
if
she
meant
to
carry
out
her
vow
of
pride
and
scorn
she
leaned
upon
his
arm
and
they
walked
silently
through
the
lovely
moonlight
down
to
the
shore
laurel
heart
beat
quick
and
fast
against
her
husband

the
beauty
of
the
moonlight
and
the
sea
the
mellow
notes
of
the
all
had
their
own
effect
upon
her
merivale
had
rightly
estimated
each
as
a
softening
influence
it
was
such
a
night
as
emma
alice
browne
describes
in
her
sweet
poem
the
before
us
bathed
in
pearly
light
a
reach
of
ocean
heaved
and
rolled
girt
with
the
purple
zone
of
night
and
clasped
with
one
pale
glint
of
gold
behind
us
in
the
gay
saloon
the
flutes
wailed
out
their
sweet
despair
the
passionate
viols
sobbed
in
tune
the
horns
exulted
and
the
air
pulsed
with
the
low
mellifluous
beat
of
dimpling
waves
and
dancing
feet
leon
looked
down
into
the
beautiful
face
that
was
so
maddeningly
fair
in
the
soft
light
and
his
heart
swelled
with
a
great
despair
to
think
that
she
had
once
been
his
that
that
peerless
form
had
rested
in
his
arms
that
sweet
face
slept
upon
his
breast
and
now
divided
by
a
woman
pride
they
were
as
widely
severed
as
if
jean

vast
calm
river
so
dread
to
see
rolled
its
rushing
waves
between
their
hearts
standing
thus
arm
in
arm
each
heart
busy
with
its
deep
emotions
neither
heard
the
furtive
steps
creeping
slowly
up
behind
them
neither
saw
the
cruel
jealous
face
with
its
wild
eyes
glaring
upon
them
neither
saw
the
gleam
of
the
slender
dagger
clutched
in
the
murderous
hand
neither
dreamed
of
the
man
who
lurked
behind
them
nor
of
the
woman
who
followed
at
a
safe
distance
eager
to
sate
her
vengeance
in
the
sight
of
her
rival

she
answered
without
removing
her
eyes
from
the
waves
that
broke
at
her
feet
in
snowy
surf
she
felt
too
weak
to
meet
the
mute
pleading
of
those
eyes
she
loved
so
madly
you
think
that

have
followed

you
are

your

is
to
me
i
could
never
the
deprecating
words

never

a
terrible
form
flashed
suddenly
before
them
a
terrible
face
gleamed
in
the
light
dagger
flashed
upward
in
the
air
and
a
voice
hoarse
with
misery
and
madness
rang
out
fiercely

the
dagger
glittered
against

the
hand
of
the
frenzied
madman

have
driven
it
swiftly
home
but
all
in
an
instant
she
was
caught
away
and
the
descending
blade
was
sheathed
in
another
breast
the
broad
breast
of
leon
le
roy
the
arms
that
had
closed
wildly
around
laurel
for
a
moment
fell
away
from
her
and
he
dropped
on
the
sands
at
her
feet
the
hot
blood
spurting
from
his
heart
and
deepening
the
rosy
hem
of
her
satin
robe
to
a
horrible
crimson
while
her
agonized
cry
rent
the
summer
night
oh

you

the
stricken

repeated
and
then
overcome
with
horror
she
knelt
down
beside
the
dead
man
and
with
her
arms
about
him
and
her
head
upon
his
breast
she
relapsed
into
unconsciousness
almost
as
deep
as
death
ross

stood
still
a
moment
like
one
frozen
with
horror
that
maddened
cry
from
the
lips
of
the
woman
he
would
have
slain
rang
fearfully
in
his
ears
he
realized
in
a
moment
to
what
fearful
lengths
he
had
been
driven
by
his
own
jealous
passion
and
the
specious
temptations
of
merivale
he
had
slain
his
hated
rival
but
he
had
brought
down
retribution
on
his
own
head
for
laurel
wild
shriek
of
despair
had
echoed
loudly
back
to
the
hotel
and
already
a
score
of
people
were
rushing
to
the
scene
startled
terrified
the
murderer
made
a
wild
rush
forward
still
clutching
in
his
hand
the
bloody
dagger
but
before
he
had
run
a
dozen
paces
he
was
brought
to
a
stop
by
the
sudden
apparition
of
a
woman
who
flung
herself
wildly
before
him
hissing
out
in
tones
of
blended
wrath
and
horror
a
terrible
malediction
upon
his
head
murderer
you
have
slain
how
dared
you
how
dared
you
may
heaven
curses
light
upon
your
head
may
you
swing
from
the
rope
may
perdition
seize
your
soul
she
must
have
been
mad
for
she
flung
herself
before
him
she
barred
his
way
she
clung
to
him
with
her
desperate
white
arms
heedless
of
his
curses
and
remonstrances
terribly
intent
on
delivering
him
up
to
justice
and
so
punishing
him
for
the
mad
mistake
he
had
made
in
slaying
the
husband
and
sparing
the
wife
she
must
have
been
mad
or
she
would
have
known
that
he
would
not
tamely
submit
to
detention
with
the
feet
of
the
avengers
gaining
swiftly
on
his
track
and
his
soul
writhing
in
horror
of
the
ghastly
rope
he
tried
to
thrust
her
from
him
to
tear
away
from
the
arms
that
held
him
in
desperate
bondage
he
shouted
hoarsely
for
her
to
let
him
go
devil
in
woman
shape
it
was
you
that
tempted
me
he
cried
out
with
a
fierce
oath
now
let
me
go
or
i
swear
i
will
kill
you
as
i
did
him
she
must
have
been
mad
for
she
did
not
heed
the
threat
she
only
clung
the
tighter
in
spite
of
his
frantic
struggles
to
release
himself
from
the
arms
that
twined
around
him
venomously
like
living
serpents
in
the
deadly
embrace
of
hate
i
will
never
let
you
go
never
she
hissed
out
madly
and
in
his
frantic
fear
hearing
the
steps
of
his
pursuers
coming
nearer
and
nearer
on
his
trail
he
lifted
the
cruel
dagger
still
reeking
with
le
roy
and
plunged
it
fiercely
in
her
breast
as
it
gleamed
bare
and
white
in
the
beautiful
moonlight
ah
she
gasped
and
the
white
arms
relaxed
their
hold
her
body
wavered
and
fell
limply
forward
he
thrust
it
desperately
from
him
and
sprung
forward
free
free
but
at
what
terrible
cost
to
his
soul
the
woman
whose
low
soft
whisperings
had
tempted
him
to
murder
the
woman
who
in
her
madness
would
fain
have
delivered
him
up
to
the
law
vengeance
lay
dead
upon
the
shore
the
cold
white
moonlight
shining
down
into
her
ghastly
staring
eyes
and
pallid
face
retribution
had
overtaken
her
and
the
fate
she
had
plotted
for
another
recoiled
upon
her
own
head
the
serpent
she
had
loosed
to
destroy
another
struck
its
deadly
fangs
into
her
own
heart
they
lifted
her
up
tenderly
and
pitifully
and
bore
her
back
to
the
hotel
they
spoke
of
her
with
the
gentlest
pity
and
regret
as
the
victim
of
a
cruel
murder
for
no
one
ever
knew
the
truth
no
one
guessed
that
she
was
to
blame
for
the
tragedy
that
had
ended
her
life
in
so
disastrous
a
fashion
the
shadow
of
her
sin
never
rested
on
her
grave
for
there
was
no
one
to
betray
her
ross
powell
was
never
apprehended
his
deadly
fear
lent
wings
to
his
feet
and
he
escaped
from
his
pursuers
and
made
good
his
flight
to
a
land
he
never
returned
to
his
native
shore
he
was
never
brought
to
justice
all
his
punishment
came
to
him
through
his
own
coward
conscience
the
cruel
of
remorse
followed
him
through
the
world
the
double
murder
he
had
committed
lay
like
a
mountain
weight
upon
his
soul
he
had
been
bad
and
wicked
but
of
his
own
self
he
would
never
have
committed
murder
he
had
been
goaded
into
its
commission
by
a
temporary
madness
and
in
time
he
repented
most
sincerely
of
his
sin
and
died
in
the
humble
hope
of
forgiveness
by
a
merciful
redeemer

and

full
of
wonder
and
pity
and
sympathy
they
lifted
the
golden
head
from
le

breast
and
bore
her
away
no
one
dreamed
that
he
had
given
his
life
to
save
hers
no
one
dreamed
that
she
belonged
to
him
by
the
dearest
tie
possible
to
mortals
no
one
knew
that
her
rightful
place
was
by
his
side
and
the
sealed
lips
did
not
open
to
claim
her
right
for
they
were
pale
and
rigid
as
if
the
finger
of
eternal
silence
had
been
laid
upon
them
strangers
hands
carried
her
back
to
the
hotel
and
the
news
of
the
dreadful
tragedy
spread
far
and
wide
it
excited
the
greatest
wonder
it
was
so
sudden
so
strange
so
mysterious
no
one
knew
the
murderer
and
no
one
guessed
the
motive
for
his
double
crime
no
one
except
perhaps
gordon
and
he
was
wisely
silent
he
deemed
it
for
the
best
but
it
created
a
great
sensation
mr
le
roy
was
so
well
known
as
a
gentleman
of
birth
culture
and
wealth
and
merivale
as
a
woman
of
fashion
that
the
wonder
and
excitement
were
most
intense
popular
indignation
ran
high
against
ross
powell
if
they
had
caught
him
it
is
most
probable
that
judge
lynch
would
have
been
his
executioner
the
sensation
had
its
element
of
romance
it
was
whispered
far
and
near
that
the
beautiful
belle
lynn
had
fainted
with
her
head
upon
mr
le
roy
breast
they
told
how
her
delicate
laces
had
been
crimsoned
by
his
life
blood
how
she
had
looked
like
a
dead
woman
when
they
lifted
her
up
when
it
became
known
next
day
that
her
excitement
had
culminated
in
an
attack
of
brain
fever
the
interest
and
sympathy
and
curiosity
ran
higher
and
higher
people
agreed
that
there
must
have
been
something
between
mr
le
roy
and
lynn
they
deemed
that
they
had
been
lovers

the

her
ill
and
unconscious

stayed
also
gordon
went
back
and
brought
his
wife
down
to
see
her
daughter
she
was
very
willing
to
forgive
her
now
years
had
softened
her
anger
and
resentment
and
when
she
heard
that
cyril
wentworth
had
proved
himself
worthy
of
her
beautiful
daughter
she
threw
pride
to
the
winds
and
forgave
him
too
they
had
a
very
tender
reconciliation
the
mother
and
daughter
in
the
quiet
room
where
laurel
lay
ill
unto
death
with
brain
fever
her
beautiful
golden
hair
cut
close
to
her
head
and
cold
sparkling
ice
laid
against
the
fevered
brain
to
cool
the
subtle
fire
that
burned
in
her
veins
beatrix
told
her
mother
all
that
she
suspected
that
lynn
was
laurel
le

and
gordon
quite
agreed
with
her
she
had
never
forgotten
the
beautiful
face
of
the
girl
who
had
deceived
leon
le
roy
so
bitterly
she
recalled
it
again
now
and
she
was
sure
that
her
daughter
was
right
there
could
not
have
been
two
such
lovely
faces
in
the
world
she
did
not
doubt
that
this
was
leon
wife
she
forgave
laurel
now
for
all
that
she
had
done
it
was
easy
to
forgive
her
now
when
she
lay
so
ill
perhaps
dying
she
and
beatrix
vied
with
each
other
in
the
care
of
the
invalid
they
would
not
trust
her
wholly
to
the
care
of
a
hired
nurse
her
life
was
too
precious
laurence

trixy
were
left
to

gave
all
her

not
do
too
much
for
her
said
gentle
beatrix
she
was
like
an
angel
to
me
the
day
came
at
last
when
her
patience
and
fidelity
were
rewarded
laurel
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
up
with
the
light
of
reason
shining
in
her
face
the
crisis
of
her
terrible
delirium
was
past
she
would
recover
she
looked
at
beatrix
and
a
faint
flush
stole
into
her
pale
face
have
i
told
all
in
my
delirium
she
asked
you
have
told
nothing
all
your
ravings
have
been
of
your
books
and
of
your
child
beatrix
answered
gently
a
look
of
anxiety
stole
into
the
hollow
dark
eyes
my
little
laurie
she
said
wistfully
he
is
well
and
happy
he
has
been
well
cared
for
answered
beatrix
but
i
must
not
bring
him
to
you
yet
you
are
not
strong
enough
can
you
wait
yes
i
can
wait
laurel
answered
patiently
then
she
laid
her
thin
white
hand
on
beatrix
arm
can
you
forgive
me
she
said
i
have
been
hard
and
proud
and
wicked
i
have
willfully
deceived
you
i
am
really
laurel
vane
beatrix
bent
and
kissed
the
poor
pale
lips
that
faltered
over
this
humble
confession
my
dear
i
have
known
it
all
the
while
she
said
simply
and
you
forgive
me
for
my
duplicity
asked
laurel
in
wonder
my
dear
if
you
can
forgive
me
all
the
sorrow
my
willful
plot
brought
down
upon
your
head
there
is
nothing
i
can
not
forgive
you
cried
impulsive
beatrix
you
were
not
to
blame
laurel
answered
and
the
warm
color
drifted
over
her
face
as
she
went
on
sadly
it
was
all
the
fault
of
my
mad
love
beatrix
i
blame
no
one
for
my
folly
and
sin
if
i
had
gone
away
from
eden
with
clarice
wells
nothing
would
have
happened
i
stayed
and
brought
down
fate
upon
my
own
head
and
his
a
happy
fate
my
dear
if
only
you
will
be
reconciled
to
him
said
beatrix
gently
the
dark
eyes
looked
up
at
her
full
of
the
pathos
of
regret
and
despair
ah
now
i
understand
all
the
pathos
that
lies
in
those
words
she
said
i
was
mad
i
think
mad
with
my
wounded
love
and
pride
i
denied
my
identity
to
him
i
refused
to
listen
to
his
repentance
i
was
cruelly
hard
and
cold
and
now
my
punishment
has
come
i
repent
but
he
can
not
hear
me
my
love
can
not
reach
him
for
he
is
dead
dead
ah
no
my
dear
is
it
possible
that
you
have
been
thinking
so
he
lives
he
will
soon
be
well
and
strong
again
if
only
you
will
forgive
him
then
she
stopped
suddenly
for
laurel
head
had
fallen
back
her
eyes
were
closed
the
shock
of
joy
had
been
too
much
laurel
had
quietly
fainted
when
she
came
to
herself
again
there
was
a
strange
resolute
look
in
the
dark
eyes
she
took
beatrix
hand
and
held
it
tightly
in
both
her
own
as
if
she
needed
strength
and
support
he
lives
she
said
wildly
oh
how
glad
i
am
now
i
will
make
atonement
to
him
he
would
have
given
his
life
to
save
mine
i
will
give
him
more
than
my
life
i
do
not
understand
you
said
beatrix
wonderingly
you
shall
know
soon
said
laurel
dear
beatrix
do
let
me
have
laurie
a
little
while
i
am
sure
it
will
not
hurt
me
i
am
stronger
than
you
think
chapter
lxvi
beatrix
did
not
know
how
to
refuse
the
mother
prayer
she
knew
that
laurel
heart
was
yearning
for
the
child
and
she
did
not
really
think
that
it
would
do
her
any
injury
to
see
him
she
made
her
promise
that
she
would
not
excite
herself
and
then
she
went
after
the
little
lad
who
was
as
usual
at
play
with
trixy
upon
the
shore
she
made
laurence
promise
that
he
would
be
very
gentle
and
quiet
in
his
mamma
room
and
he
very
readily
agreed
to
do
so
she
knew
that
he
was
a
little
gentleman
who
would
keep
his
word
of
honor
and
so
she
sent
him
in
and
waited
outside
patiently
until
that
momentous
interview
was
over
laurel
kept
the
child
almost
an
hour
no
one
knew
just
what
she
said
to
him
or
how
much
of
the
past
she
revealed
to
him
but
the
boy
came
out
with
a
face
all
glowing
with
joy
and
sought
little
trixy
to
her
he
confided
his
joyous
news
i
have
a
real
live
papa
trixy
he
is
not
dead
as
we
thought
he
is
good
and
handsome
as
handsome
as
your
papa
trixy
dear
and
when
mamma
gets
well
she
is
going
to
take
me
to
him
trixy
was
delighted
at
the
good
fortune
that
had
befallen
her
boy
lover
it
formed
an
inexhaustible
theme
with
them
they
discussed
it
daily
and
compared
notes
on
their
papas
in
the
most
earnest
fashion
laurence
was
very
impatient
to
have
his
mamma
get
well
the
vague
longing
that
had
haunted
him
all
his
lifetime
would
be
realized
when
he
went
home
to
that
splendid
papa
whom
already
he
loved
in
anticipation
laurel
convalesced
very
fast
since
she
had
heard
that
her
husband
still
lived
there
was
a
great
change
in
her
she
was
very
grave
and
thoughtful
even
amounting
to
sadness
beatrix
could
not
understand
her
she
was
fonder
than
ever
of
her
child
but
there
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
passionate
sorrow
mingled
with
her
love
she
would
fondle
and
caress
him
and
then
she
would
weep
bitterly
over
him
why
do
you
weep
over
your
child
beatrix
asked
her
in
wonder
i
love
him
so
dearly
answered
laurel
evasively
i
can
not
understand
why
that
should
be
a
reason
for
weeping
over
him
you
ought
to
be
quite
happy
over
such
a
beautiful
boy
said
impulsive
beatrix
sighing
as
she
thought
of
her
own
little
lad
sleeping
far
away
beneath
the
skies
of
england
i
happy
over
him
said
laurel
but
oh
beatrix
you
do
not
quite
understand
me
hitherto
my
little
laurence
has
belonged
only
to
me
he
came
to
me
in
a
dark
and
troublous
time
when
i
was
alone
and
friendless
in
the
world
i
worked
for
him
i
made
money
for
him
and
i
filled
up
the
void
in
my
heart
with
his
but
for
him
i
should
have
died
i
could
not
have
borne
my
life
and
now
we
shall
be
parted
i
and
my
little
son
i
shall
give
him
to
his
father
but
oh
beatrix
what
shall
i
do
without
him
i
can
not
understand
you
indeed
laurel
said
simple
beatrix
you
are
going
home
to
your
husband
are
you
not
dear
surely
you
will
not
mind
dividing
the
child
love
with
him
think
how
selfishly
you
have
kept
it
to
yourself
all
these
years
and
you
will
not
lose
him
or
be
parted
from
him
you
know
what
the
poet
says
is
his
and
half
is
thine
depend
upon
it
laurel
you
will
be
happier
in
the
child
love
when
his
father
shares
it
it
is
only
natural
that
you
should
be
you
will
understand
my
meaning
better
in
a
little
while
dear
beatrix
laurel
answered
gently
and
then
she
abruptly
changed
the
subject
i
have
always
wanted
to
ask
you
about
clarice
wells
she
said
what
has
become
of
her
beatrix
laughed
sweetly
and
gayly
i
am
glad
you
have
not
forgotten
clarice
she
said
she
was
a
good
girl
and
she
admired
you
very
much
i
was
sorry
to
lose
her
when
i
left
england
but
i
could
not
forbid
the
bans
she
is
married
then
asked
laurel
yes
and
her
marriage
was
quite
romantic
should
you
like
to
hear
about
it
very
much
laurel
replied
you
would
scarcely
believe
it
of
one
so
devoted
to
the
laws
of
caste
and
who
lectured
you
so
roundly
for
aspiring
above
your
station
but
clarice
is
actually
the
wife
of
an
english
baronet
laughed
beatrix
and
it
all
happened
in
the
most
romantic
fashion
i
always
thought
that
clarice
had
a
spice
of
romance
in
her
nature
she
betrayed
it
when
she
lent
herself
so
readily
to
the
furtherance
of
our
girlish
conspiracy
yes
sighed
laurel
she
met
him
her
baronet
in
the
alps
where
we
were
taking
our
little
summer
holidays
continued
beatrix
he
was
summering
there
too
and
met
by
chance
the
usual
way
you
know
laurel
she
saved
his
life
he
was
rolling
down
a
precipice
and
she
adroitly
caught
him
back
she
was
always
a
little
thing
well
he
was
grateful
she
was
interested
and
next
thing
they
fell
in
love
clarice
was
very
sensible
at
first
she
refused
to
have
anything
to
say
to
him
and
i
applauded
her
but
really
laurel
it
was
not
so
bad
he
was
not
the
manner
born
until
a
year
before
he
had
been
plain
john
bull
a
briefless
barrister
he
had
succeeded
to
the
baronetage
by
a
series
of
accidental
and
unexpected
deaths
of
and
he
was
plain
and
sensible
and
forty
years
old
at
least
i
do
not
think
his
age
was
any
objection
cried
laurel
hastily
and
blushing
very
much
no
indeed
and
it
did
not
prove
so
in
this
case
smiled
beatrix
he
would
not
take
her
no
for
an
answer
he
never
rested
until
he
made
pretty
clarice
lady
it
is
very
romantic
i
shall
make
it
a
plot
for
a
novel
declared
laurel
i
dare
say
clarice
would
not
scold
me
now
for
aspiring
above
my
station
she
added
with
a
pretty
pensive
smile
i
dare
say
not
said
beatrix
greatly
amused
exceptions

cases
chapter
lxvii
in
five
weeks
after
that
tragedy
at
the
seashore
laurel
announced
her
intention
of
returning
to
belle
vue
she
had
convalesced
very
rapidly
and
the
bloom
and
beauty
of
health
were
fast
returning
to
her
lovely
face
nothing
was
left
to
remind
one
of
her
almost
fatal
illness
save
the
short
soft
rings
of
sunny
hair
that
clustered
all
over
the
beautiful
graceful
head
beatrix
grieved
sorely
over
the
loss
of
that
wealth
of
golden
tresses
from
her
friend
head
but
after
all
it
scarcely
detracted
from
laurel
beauty
the
pretty
babyish
ringlets
lent
a
charm
to
the
fair
face
and
made
a
halo
about
the
brow
that
made
her
half
of
earth
and
half
divine
let
us
go
home
to
belle
vue
she
said
pleadingly
to
her
uncle
and
he
eager
to
gratify
her
slightest
wish
consented
they
wished
to
have
beatrix
and
her
mother
go
with
them
but
they
excused
themselves
and
promised
to
come
later
on
when
laurel
has
left
you
and
you
feel
lonely
said
gordon
with
a
smile
the
beautiful
authoress
blushed
vividly
and
then
grew
very
pale
she
made
no
answer
to
the
half
question
no
one
quite
knew
what
she
intended
to
do
no
one
could
understand
her
she
was
so
shy
so
reticent
she
blushed
so
at
the
slightest
mention
of
mr
le
roy
name
but
beatrix
as
she
held
her
in
her
arms
at
parting
whispered
pleadingly
against
her
cheek
you
will
not
be
hard
and
unforgiving
any
longer
dear
you
will
go
home
to
him
you
shall
hear
from
me
in
a
few
days
laurel
answered
and
beatrix
was
obliged
to
be
content
with
that
ambiguous
reply
they
went
back
to
belle
vue
the
autumn
days
had
set
in
now
and
the
trees
were
clothed
in
all
the
glory
of
their
autumn
coloring
from
hill
to
hill
from
shore
to
shore
glowed
with
scarlet
and
brown
and
gold
the
sun
shone
still
with
all
the
brightness
of
summer
the
flowers
were
in
their
glory
yet
there
was
no
cloud
in
all
the
summer
sky
that
morning
when
laurel
went
shyly
up
to
her
uncle
side
uncle
carlyle
i
want
you
to
take
me
over
to
eden
this
morning
she
said
with
the
beautiful
blushes
mantling
on
her
cheeks
he
drew
the
back
of
his
hand
hastily
across
his
eyes
the
hour
for
which
he
had
longed
and
dreaded
had
come
he
was
going
to
lose
laurel
and
his
darling
little
laurie
my
dear
are
you
strong
enough
he
asked
her
wistfully
remember
we
only
came
to
belle
vue
yesterday
i
am
so
restless
it
seems
as
if
i
can
not
wait
she
said
and
he
saw
that
the
dark
eyes
were
full
of
unrest
and
pain
we
will
go
at
once
dear
he
said
and
though
he
did
not
say
another
word
laurel
understood
why
he
took
her
so
tenderly
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
she
did
not
speak
her
heart
was
too
full
for
words
they
took
little
laurence
and
drove
over
to
eden
ford
sent
in
his
card
alone
to
mrs
le
roy
and
they
waited
silently
in
the
grand
for
her
but
when
he
heard
her
coming
he
withdrew
into
the
shadow
of
the
curtained
he
did
not
wish
to
embarrass
her
meeting
with
laurel
by
his
presence
the
door
opened
and
she
entered
slowly
with
a
step
that
had
grown
unconsciously
feeble
and
halting
the
fine
old
face
looked
pale
and
sad
there
was
a
sorrowful
droop
about
the
delicate
lips
the
years
that
had
brought
laurel
to
the
perfection
of
her
womanly
beauty
had
sadly
aged
leon
mother
she
came
in
sadly
enough
but
when
she
saw
who
her
visitors
were
the
light
of
a
sudden
tremulous
hope
flashed
over
her
proud
sad
face
her
dim
eyes
brightened
mrs
lynn
she
exclaimed
wonderingly
the
beautiful
woman
in
the
white
dress
with
the
crimson
roses
fastened
against
her
round
white
throat
rose
and
went
hastily
forward
there
was
a
look
of
pain
and
shame
on
the
fair
face
do
not
call
me
by
that
name
it
never
was
mine
it
has
only
been
the
mask
beneath
which
i
hoped
to
hide
my
identity
cried
laurel
i
am
ashamed
and
penitent
now
call
me
laurel
mother
and
say
that
you
forgive
me
laurel
i
am
so
glad
cried
mrs
le
roy
throwing
her
arms
about
her
neck
and
then
with
the
charming
inconsistency
of
woman
she
wept
she
had
forgotten
the
child
in
her
joy
at
the
restoration
of
laurel
but
suddenly
a
little
hand
stole
into
hers
and
a
voice
said
grandmamma
she
turned
and
caught
the
beautiful
boy
to
her
heart
him
in
her
fond
caresses
my
precious
little
grandchild
she
cried
and
laurence
asked
her
if
you
are
glad
that
we
have
come
home
mamma
and
me
why
do
you
cry
you
must
not
ask
questions
my
little
lad
said
ford
coming
forward
and
greeting
his
hostess
and
thinking
to
himself
that
she
had
suddenly
grown
beautiful
in
the
radiance
of
the
that
beamed
upon
her
face
he
asked
the
question
that
laurel
was
too
timid
to
syllable
upon
her
lips
how
is
mr
le
roy
he
has
had
a
relapse
he
is
quite
unwell
mrs
le
roy
said
tremulously
he
has
been
very
ill
since
we
brought
him
from
the
seashore
he
makes
no
effort
to
recover
he
does
not
seem
to
care
to
live
she
looked
at
laurel
as
she
spoke
it
is
all
your
fault
dear
she
said
gently
life
has
never
been
the
same
since
you
were
lost
to
him
only
this
morning
the
physician
told
me
that
without
some
object
in
life
something
more
to
live
for
than
he
has
now
my
son
would
never
get
well
laurel
face
was
very
pale
she
drew
her
arm
tightly
around
her
son
as
he
stood
by
her
side
may
i
see
him
she
asked
in
a
faint
trembling
voice
without
lifting
her
eyes
he
is
in
his
own
room
dear
go
to
him
as
soon
as
you
please
mrs
le
roy
answered
gladly
laurel
did
not
wait
for
another
word
they
saw
that
she
was
very
pale
that
she
trembled
very
much
and
their
hearts
went
out
to
her
in
silent
sympathy
for
her
suffering
she
rose
took
her
little
son
by
the
hand
and
silently
left
the
room
chapter
lxviii
leon
le
roy
lay
among
the
pillows
of
his
luxurious
bed
that
morning
alone
and
lonely
it
was
a
beautiful
room
where
he
lay
but
the
invalid
took
no
pleasure
in
it
it
was
large
and
lofty
with
a
lovely
painted
ceiling
and
the
walls
were
hung
in
beautiful
draperies
of
silk
and
snowy
lace
the
furniture
and
carpet
were
upholstered
in
pink
velvet
the
carpet
had
a
pattern
of
roses
upon
it
the
vases
on
the
marble
mantel
were
filled
with
exquisite
flowers
leon
had
been
surrounded
by
beautiful
things
all
his
life
they
did
not
add
to
his
pleasures
nor
detract
from
his
pain
he
lay
there
wearily
among
the
downy
pillows
with
his
wasted
white
hand
over
his
heavy
eyes
and
his
thoughts
fixed
on
the
beautiful
wife
so
fatally
lost
to
him
only
that
morning
the
physician
had
warned
him
you
must
rouse
yourself
le
roy
or
you
will
die
from
the
effects
of
your
terrible
wound
the
strain
upon
your
system
has
been
most
severe
i
have
exhausted
my
art
in
bringing
you
to
the
point
of
convalescence
now
you
must
help
yourself
if
you
give
way
to
this
fit
of
despondency
this
that
i
see
creeping
upon
you
i
will
not
answer
for
the
consequences
you
must
rally
from
this
spell
of
dejection
make
yourself
an
object
in
life
and
live
for
it
then
he
went
away
he
had
done
all
he
could
for
the
suffering
body
he
did
not
know
how
to
minister
to
a
mind
diseased
he
had
detected
the
symptoms
but
leon
alone
could
apply
the
remedy
he
lay
silently
thinking
there
was
only
one
object
for
which
he
could
have
cared
to
live
and
that
was
unattainable
why
should
he
exert
himself
to
hold
on
to
a
life
that
was
scarce
worth
living
why
not
let
go
the
anchor
and
drift
idly
with
the
tide
that
dashed
him
hither
and
thither
on
its
restless
waves
who
would
greatly
care
to
live
when
all
of
life
had
grown
into
a
long
regret
his
door
unclosed
softly
but
he
did
not
turn
his
head
he
knew
that
his
mother
had
had
visitors
and
he
supposed
that
she
was
now
returning
he
did
not
look
at
her
he
knew
that
she
could
not
bear
to
see
the
heavy
sadness
in
his
eyes
a
light
step
stole
across
the
floor
and
saying
to
himself
she
thinks
me
asleep
he
gently
closed
his
eyes
it
was
a
harmless
deception
he
often
practiced
upon
her
thinking
him
asleep
she
would
feel
more
content
papa
said
a
proud
happy
little
voice
and
a
soft
hand
fluttered
down
upon
his
own
he
opened
his
eyes
with
a
start
a
child
was
standing
beside
him
a
beautiful
boy
with
hair
and
eyes
like
his
own
and
his
mother
wistful
smile
laurence
lynn
laurie
he
cried
yes
papa
i
have
come
home
to
you
i
am
your
son
really
and
truly
are
you
not
glad
cried
the
child
who
had
been
so
loved
and
petted
all
his
life
that
it
was
no
vanity
in
him
to
imagine
that
any
one
must
be
proud
and
glad
in
possession
of
him
glad
leon
could
not
speak
for
a
moment
he
was
dazed
with
the
suddenness
of
the
surprise
he
threw
his
arm
about
his
son
and
strained
him
to
his
heart
but
his
thoughts
were
with
the
mother
more
than
the
child
did
you
come
alone
dear
he
asked
as
soon
as
he
could
command
his
voice
oh
no
mamma
and
uncle
carlyle
came
with
me
mamma
he
suddenly
looked
around
then
broke
from
leon
clasp
and
ran
to
the
door
mamma
come
back
he
called
why
did
you
run
away
leon
leaned
on
his
elbow
and
watched
the
door
impatiently
his
breath
coming
and
going
in
great
strangling
gasps
his
heart
full
of
trembling
anticipation
what
does
it
mean
will
she
forgive
me
will
she
come
back
to
me
he
asked
himself
in
a
bewildering
maze
of
hope
and
anxiety
laurie
opened
the
door
and
ran
out
into
the
hall
he
came
back
in
a
moment
and
before
he
entered
leon
heard
the
echo
of
a
loved
familiar
footstep
beside
that
of
the
child
the
color
rushed
into
his
face
his
heart
beat
tumultuously
why
did
you
run
away
mamma
the
child
was
still
repeating
as
they
came
across
the
threshold
hand
in
hand
leon
had
heard
that
she
had
been
very
ill
after
the
shock
of
his
supposed
death
that
dreadful
night
he
had
drawn
some
hopeful
auguries
from
the
news
at
first
perhaps
she
loved
him
still
perhaps
she
would
relent
and
come
back
to
him
but
he
had
waited
so
long
for
a
sign
from
her
that
he
had
fallen
into
despair
again
the
sight
of
her
now
as
she
came
into
the
room
revived
the
dying
embers
of
hope
within
his
breast
to
his
fond
adoring
eyes
she
had
never
looked
more
lovely
despite
the
closely
cut
curls
and
the
extreme
pallor
of
her
face
she
came
across
the
floor
holding
the
child
by
the
hand
and
as
she
met
the
imploring
gaze
of
his
eyes
her
own
seemed
to
swim
in
a
fine
glittering
mist
of
unshed
tears
she
stood
there
silently
a
moment
and
he
waited
humbly
to
hear
her
speak
to
pronounce
his
doom
as
it
were
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
fate
itself
hung
on
those
tender
wistful
lips
in
that
moment
of
passionate
suspense
and
longing
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
experienced
something
of
the
feelings
that
must
have
thrilled
her
that
terrible
night
when
she
had
prayed
him
for
forgiveness
and
he
had
coldly
put
her
away
it
is
retribution
he
said
to
himself
while
the
cold
dew
of
agony
beaded
his
brow
she
was
holding
laurie
hand
tightly
clasped
within
her
own
once
twice
she
raised
it
to
her
lips
then
suddenly
she
laid
it
quickly
in
leon
palm
and
withdrew
her
own
her
voice
had
a
strange
almost
dying
sound
as
she
said
you
saved
my
life
leon
ay
you
did
more
you
would
have
given
your
life
for
mine
do
not
think
me
ungrateful
do
not
believe
that
i
could
forget
what
i
owe
you
i
am
come
to
make
reparation
you
would
have
given
me
your
life
see
i
give
you
what
is
dearer
than
my
life
to
me
the
heir
to
eden
then
she
stepped
back
into
the
shadow
she
did
not
wish
him
to
see
the
white
agony
that
was
written
on
her
face
she
would
make
the
sacrifice
bravely
not
showing
him
all
that
it
cost
her
bleeding
heart
he
drew
one
arm
around
the
child
and
held
him
to
his
breast
he
kept
the
other
free
his
eyes
turned
wistfully
to
that
fair
sad
face
half
veiled
by
the
falling
curtain
laurel
he
breathed
there
was
a
world
of
tenderness
passion
and
entreaty
in
his
tone
her
heart
beat
wildly
she
turned
toward
him
trying
to
look
calm
and
brave
he
held
out
his
other
arm
to
her
but
she
would
not
understand
she
gazed
at
him
in
silent
distress
laurel
he
said
again
the
gift
would
not
be
complete
without
you
are
you
not
coming
to
me
too
dear
the
swift
color
rushed
into
her
face
her
great
dark
eyes
brimmed
over
with
tears
but
she
stood
quite
still
she
would
not
stir
chapter
lxix
she
did
not
stir
she
did
not
speak
the
tears
brimmed
over
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
but
she
kept
her
place
in
silence
will
you
not
come
to
me
he
pleaded
and
she
answered
then
drearily
i
can
not
you
can
not
oh
laurel
do
not
say
so
he
cried
what
is
to
hinder
you
from
coming
back
to
my
heart
what
can
stand
between
us
your
own
words
she
answered
brushing
the
tears
away
and
gazing
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
somber
misery
and
pain
he
was
full
of
wonder
and
perplexity
i
can
not
understand
you
he
said
i
would
give
the
world
to
have
you
back
again
laurel
i
love
you
with
the
most
faithful
love
the
world
ever
knew
i
shall
never
cease
to
love
you
yet
once
you
said
surely
you
remember
it
st
leon
that
you
could
never
again
love
a
woman
who
had
deceived
you
once
fallen
from
its
pedestal
the
broken
idol
could
never
be
restored
again
the
words
came
back
to
his
memory
the
words
he
had
spoken
before
he
the
words
that
were
all
that
stood
between
them
now
he
looked
at
her
in
anguish
he
would
have
given
anything
if
only
he
had
never
made
that
vain
boast
how
vain
he
had
never
known
till
now
i
was
foolish
and
mad
and
blind
he
cried
it
was
the
most
empty
boast
the
world
ever
knew
oh
laurel
will
you
not
forgive
me
for
my
hardness
and
cruelty
she
stood
still
with
her
small
hands
folded
before
her
her
fair
head
drooping
low
as
she
answered
i
do
forgive
you
then
you
will
come
back
to
me
you
will
not
be
hard
upon
me
laurel
i
have
repented
so
bitterly
i
repented
within
hours
after
i
had
put
you
away
from
me
so
hardly
all
my
life
since
we
parted
has
been
one
long
repentance
my
darling
i
did
not
come
back
for
this
leon
she
said
tremulously
i
meant
only
to
give
you
the
child
i
thought
i
should
go
away
then
little
laurence
uttered
a
startled
cry
he
wrenched
himself
loose
from
his
father
clasp
and
ran
to
her
to
hide
his
face
in
the
soft
white
folds
of
her
dress
no
no
he
said
vehemently
i
can
not
stay
with
papa
unless
you
will
stay
too
mamma
i
love
you
the
best
leon
looked
at
his
wife
she
shrunk
a
little
before
that
look
it
was
sadly
reproachful
you
see
how
it
is
he
said
you
have
kept
him
from
me
all
his
life
and
now
he
has
no
love
to
give
me
but
the
child
interposed
vehemently
i
love
you
both
and
i
will
stay
with
you
both
only
mamma
must
not
go
away
from
eden
he
drew
her
forward
impulsively
as
he
spoke
he
placed
her
hand
in
her
husband
and
closed
his
own
little
dimpled
fingers
around
them
so
that
laurel
could
not
draw
hers
away
mamma
i
love
you
first
and
best
he
said
but
i
love
papa
and
grandmamma
too
if
he
has
been
naughty
let
us
forgive
him
and
stay
with
him
stay
with
me
laurel
echoed
leon
she
felt
the
warm
persuasive
clasp
of
his
fingers
on
hers
all
the
ice
about
her
heart
melted
beneath
that
touch
she
could
not
hold
out
against
him
she
knew
that
she
must
yield
if
she
did
not
fly
from
his
presence
oh
let
me
go
she
cried
it
is
not
best
that
i
should
come
back
to
you
it
is
the
child
you
want
there
is
so
much
in
the
past
that
would
haunt
us
there
is
so
much
to
rouse
reproach
and
regret
we
are
best
apart
oh
let
me
go
but
somehow
he
had
drawn
her
down
to
the
clasp
of
his
arms
now
his
warm
lips
were
pressed
against
her
cheek
only
one
word
dear
he
whispered
do
you
love
me
still
my
laurel
i
have
loved
you
always
she
murmured
and
she
knew
that
with
this
confession
love
had
conquered
pride
then
let
us
forget
all
else
but
our
love
he
pleaded
you
will
stay
with
me
laurel
i
will
stay
she
answered
and
never
yet
since
first
in
paradise
the
four
rivers
the
first
roses
blew
came
purer
pleasure
unto
mortal
kind
than
lived
through
her
who

happy
hour
put
hand
to
hand
beneath
her
husband
heart
and
felt
him
hers
