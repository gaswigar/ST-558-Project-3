preface
to
read
these
stories
again
thirty
and
more
years
after
they
were
written
is
to
recall
many
memories
sad
or
glad
with
which
this
reader
need
not
be
interrupted
but
i
have
to
make
sure
that
they
are
intelligible
to
readers
of
a
generation
later
than
that
for
which
they
were
written
the
story
of
the
brick
moon
was
begun
in
my
dear
brother
nathan
in
union
college
schenectady
in
the
year
when
he
was
professor
of
the
english
language
there
the
account
of
the
first
plan
of
the
moon
is
a
sketch
as
accurate
as
was
needed
of
the
old
chat
and
dreams
plans
and
jokes
of
our
college
days
before
he
left
cambridge
in
as
i
learned
almost
everything
i
know
through
his
care
and
love
and
help
directly
or
indirectly
it
is
a
pleasure
to
say
this
here
the
story
was
published
in
the
atlantic
monthly
in
and
it
was
the
last
story
i
wrote
for
that
magazine
before
assuming
the
charge
of
old
and
new
a
magazine
which
i
edited
from
to
and
for
which
i
wrote
ten
times
one
is
ten
which
has
been
printed
in
the
third
volume
of
this
series
among
the
kind
references
to
the
brick
moon
which
i
have
received
from
sympathetic
friends
i
now
recall
with
the
greatest
pleasure
one
sent
me
by
asaph
hall
the
distinguished
astronomer
of
the
national
observatory
in
sending
me
the
ephemeris
of
the
two
moons
of
mars
which
he
revealed
to
this
world
of
ours
he
wrote
the
smaller
of
these
moons
is
the
veritable
brick
moon
that
in
the
moment
of
triumph
for
the
greatest
astronomical
discovery
of
a
generation
hall
should
have
time
or
thought
to
give
to
my
little
parable
this
was
praise
indeed
writing
in
i
said
as
the
reader
will
see
on
page
that
george
orcutt
did
not
tell
how
he
used
a
magnifying
power
of
nor
did
i
choose
to
tell
then
hoping
that
in
some
fortunate
winter
i
might
be
able
myself
to
repeat
his
process
greatly
to
the
convenience
of
astronomers
who
have
not
alvan
clark
resources
at
hand
or
who
have
to
satisfy
themselves
with
glass
lenses
of
fifteen
inches
or
even
thirty
in
diameter
but
no
such
winter
has
come
round
to
me
and
i
will
now
give
orcutt
invention
to
the
world
he
had
unlimited
freezing
power
so
have
we
now
as
we
had
not
then
with
this
power
he
made
an
ice
lens
ten
feet
in
diameter
which
was
easily
rubbed
by
the
delicate
hands
of
the
careful
women
around
him
to
precisely
the
surface
which
he
needed
let
me
hope
that
before
next
winter
passes
some
countryman
or
countrywoman
of
mine
will
have
equalled
his
success
and
with
an
ice
lens
will
surpass
all
the
successes
of
the
glasses
of
our
time
the
plan
of
crusoe
in
new
york
was
made
when
i
was
enjoying
the
princely
hospitality
of
henry
whitney
bellows
in
new
york
the
parsonage
in
that
city
commanded
a
view
of
a
lot
not
built
on
which
would
have
given
for
many
years
a
happy
home
to
any
disciple
of
mayor
pingree
if
a
somewhat
complicated
social
order
had
permitted
the
story
was
first
published
in
frank
leslie
illustrated
paper
in
reading
it
in
i
am
afraid
that
the
readers
of
a
hard
money
generation
may
not
know
that
scrip
was
in
the
sixties
the
name
for
small
change
i
regard
a
knowledge
of
every
detail
of
the
original
robinson
crusoe
as
a
necessity
in
education
girls
may
occasionally
be
excused
but
never
boys
it
ought
to
be
unnecessary
therefore
to
say
that
some
of
the
narrative
passages
of
crusoe
in
new
york
are
taken
word
for
word
from
the
text
of
defoe
if
i
do
state
this
for
the
benefit
of
a
few
unfortunate
ladies
who
are
not
familiar
with
that
text
it
is
because
i
think
no
one
among
many
courteous
critics
has
observed
it
the
survivor
story
is
one
of
eight
short
stories
which
were
published
in
the
first
christmas
number
of
old
and
new
of
the
other
stories
i
think
no
explanation
is
needed
but
such
as
was
given
at
the
time
of
their
publication
and
is
reprinted
with
each
of
them

so
that
they

or
in

so
it
all
began
more
than
thirty
years
ago
when
we
were
in
college
as
most
good
things
begin
we
were
studying
in
the
book
which
has
gray
sides
and
a
green
back
and
is
called
cambridge
astronomy
because
it
is
translated
from
the
french
we
came
across
this
business
of
the
longitude
and
as
we
talked
in
the
gloom
and
glamour
of
the
old
south
middle
we
had
going
the
usual
number
of
students
stories
about
rewards
offered
by
the
board
of
longitude
for
discoveries
in
that
matter
stories
all
of
which
so
far
as
i
know
are
lies
like
all
boys
we
had
tried
our
hands
at
perpetual
motion
for
me
i
was
sure
i
could
square
the
circle
if
they
would
give
me
chalk
enough
but
as
to
this
business
of
the
longitude
it
was
reserved
for
q
to
make
the
happy
hit
and
to
explain
it
to
the
rest
of
us
wherever
is
referred
to
in
these
pages
my
brother
nathan
is
meant
one
of
his
noms
de
plume
was
gnat
hale
because
g
and
q
may
be
silent
letters
i
wonder
if
i
can
explain
it
to
an
unlearned
world
which
has
not
studied
the
book
with
gray
sides
and
a
green
cambric
back
let
us
try
you
know
then
dear
world
that
when
you
look
at
the
north
star
it
always
appears
to
you
at
just
the
same
height
above
the
horizon
or
what
is
between
you
and
the
horizon
say
the
dwight
or
the
houses
in
concord
street
or
to
me
just
now
north
college
you
know
also
that
if
you
were
to
travel
to
the
north
pole
the
north
star
would
be
just
over
your
head
and
if
you
were
to
travel
to
the
equator
it
would
be
just
on
your
horizon
if
you
could
see
it
at
all
through
the
red
dusty
hazy
mist
in
the
north
as
you
could
not
if
you
were
just
between
pole
and
equator
on
the
line
between
us
and
canada
the
north
star
would
be
up
or
from
the
horizon
so
you
would
know
there
that
you
were
from
the
equator
then
in
boston
you
would
find
it
was
from
the
horizon
so
you
know
there
that
you
are
from
the
equator
at
seattle
again
you
would
find
it
was
high
so
our
friends
at
seattle
know
that
they
are
at
from
the
equator
the
latitude
of
a
place
in
other
words
is
found
very
easily
by
any
observation
which
shows
how
high
the
north
star
is
if
you
do
not
want
to
measure
the
north
star
you
may
take
any
star
when
it
is
just
to
north
of
you
and
measure
its
height
wait
twelve
hours
and
if
you
can
find
it
measure
its
height
again
split
the
difference
and
that
is
the
altitude
of
the
pole
or
the
latitude
of
you
the
observer
of
course
we
know
this
says
the
graduating
world
do
you
suppose
that
is
what
we
borrow
your
book
for
to
have
you
spell
out
your
miserable
elementary
astronomy
at
which
rebuff
i
should
shrink
distressed
but
that
a
chorus
of
voices
an
octave
higher
comes
up
with
dear
ingham
we
are
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
we
did
not
know
it
at
all
before
and
you
make
it
perfectly
clear
thank
you
my
dear
and
you
and
you
we
will
not
care
what
the
others
say
if
you
do
understand
it
or
do
know
it
it
is
more
than
charles
reade
knew
or
he
would
not
have
made
his
two
lovers
on
the
island
guess
at
their
latitude
as
they
did
if
they
had
either
of
them
been
educated
at
a
respectable
academy
for
the
middle
classes
they
would
have
fared
better
now
about
the
longitude
the
latitude
which
you
have
found
measures
your
distance
north
or
south
from
the
equator
or
the
pole
to
find
your
longitude
you
want
to
find
your
distance
east
or
west
from
the
meridian
of
greenwich
now
if
any
one
would
build
a
good
tall
tower
at
greenwich
straight
into
the
sky
say
a
hundred
miles
into
the
sky
of
course
if
you
and
i
were
east
or
west
of
it
and
could
see
it
we
could
tell
how
far
east
or
west
we
were
by
measuring
the
apparent
height
of
the
tower
above
our
horizon
if
we
could
see
so
far
when
the
lantern
with
a
drummond
light
ever
so
bright
on
the
very
top
of
the
tower
appeared
to
be
on
our
horizon
we
should
know
we
were
eight
hundred
and
miles
away
from
it
the
top
of
the
tower
would
answer
for
us
as
the
north
star
does
when
we
are
measuring
the
latitude
if
we
were
nearer
our
horizon
would
make
a
longer
angle
with
the
line
from
the
top
to
our
place
of
vision
if
we
were
farther
away
we
should
need
a
higher
tower
but
nobody
will
build
any
such
tower
at
greenwich
or
elsewhere
on
that
meridian
or
on
any
meridian
you
see
that
to
be
of
use
to
the
half
the
world
nearest
to
it
it
would
have
to
be
so
high
that
the
diameter
of
the
world
would
seem
nothing
in
proportion
and
then
for
the
other
half
of
the
world
you
would
have
to
erect
another
tower
as
high
on
the
other
side
it
was
this
difficulty
that
made
suggest
the
expedient
of
the
brick
moon
for
you
see
that
if
by
good
luck
there
were
a
ring
like
saturn
which
stretched
round
the
world
above
greenwich
and
the
meridian
of
greenwich
and
if
it
would
stay
above
greenwich
turning
with
the
world
any
one
who
wanted
to
measure
his
longitude
or
distance
from
greenwich
would
look
out
of
window
and
see
how
high
this
ring
was
above
his
horizon
at
greenwich
it
would
be
over
his
head
exactly
at
new
orleans
which
is
quarter
round
the
world
from
greenwich
it
would
be
just
in
his
horizon
a
little
west
of
new
orleans
you
would
begin
to
look
for
the
other
half
of
the
ring
on
the
west
instead
of
the
east
and
if
you
went
a
little
west
of
the
feejee
islands
the
ring
would
be
over
your
head
again
so
if
we
only
had
a
ring
like
that
not
round
the
equator
of
the
world
as
saturn
ring
is
around
saturn
but
vertical
to
the
plane
of
the
equator
as
the
brass
ring
of
an
artificial
globe
goes
only
far
higher
in
proportion
from
that
ring
said
pensively
we
could
calculate
the
longitude
failing
that
after
various
propositions
he
suggested
the
brick
moon
the
plan
was
this
if
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
by
a
gigantic
peashooter
you
could
shoot
a
pea
upward
from
greenwich
aimed
northward
as
well
as
upward
if
you
drove
it
so
fast
and
far
that
when
its
power
of
ascent
was
exhausted
and
it
began
to
fall
it
should
clear
the
earth
and
pass
outside
the
north
pole
if
you
had
given
it
sufficient
power
to
get
it
half
round
the
earth
without
touching
that
pea
would
clear
the
earth
forever
it
would
continue
to
rotate
above
the
north
pole
above
the
feejee
island
place
above
the
south
pole
and
greenwich
forever
with
the
impulse
with
which
it
had
first
cleared
our
atmosphere
and
attraction
if
only
we
could
see
that
pea
as
it
revolved
in
that
convenient
orbit
then
we
could
measure
the
longitude
from
that
as
soon
as
we
knew
how
high
the
orbit
was
as
well
as
if
it
were
the
ring
of
saturn
but
a
pea
is
so
small
yes
said
but
we
must
make
a
large
pea
then
we
fell
to
work
on
plans
for
making
the
pea
very
large
and
very
light
large
that
it
might
be
seen
far
away
by
navigators
light
that
it
might
be
the
easier
blown
four
thousand
and
odd
miles
into
the
air
lest
it
should
fall
on
the
heads
of
the
greenlanders
or
the
patagonians
lest
they
should
be
injured
and
the
world
lose
its
new
moon
but
of
course
all
this
had
to
be
given
up
for
the
motion
through
the
air
would
set
fire
to
this
moon
just
as
it
does
to
other
aerolites
and
all
your
would
gather
into
a
few
white
drops
which
no
rosse
telescope
even
could
discern
no
said
bravely
at
the
least
it
must
be
very
substantial
it
must
stand
fire
well
very
well
iron
will
not
answer
it
must
be
brick
we
must
have
a
brick
moon
then
we
had
to
calculate
its
size
you
can
see
on
the
old
moon
an
edifice
two
hundred
feet
long
with
any
of
the
fine
refractors
of
our
day
but
no
such
refractors
as
those
can
be
carried
by
the
poor
little
fishermen
whom
we
wanted
to
befriend
the
bones
of
whose
ships
lie
white
on
so
many
cliffs
their
names
unreported
at
any
lloyd
or
by
any
ross
themselves
the
owners
and
their
sons
the
crew
on
the
other
hand
we
did
not
want
our
moon
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
miles
away
as
the
old
moon
is
which
i
will
call
the
thornbush
moon
for
distinction
we
did
not
care
how
near
it
was
indeed
if
it
were
only
far
enough
away
to
be
seen
in
practice
from
almost
the
whole
world
there
must
be
a
little
strip
where
they
could
not
see
it
from
the
surface
unless
we
threw
it
infinitely
high
but
they
need
not
look
from
the
surface
said
they
might
climb
to
the
and
if
they
did
not
see
it
at
all
they
would
know
that
they
were
ninety
degrees
from
the
meridian
this
difficulty
about
what
we
call
the
strip
however
led
to
an
improvement
in
the
plan
which
made
it
better
in
every
way
it
was
clear
that
even
if
the
strip
were
quite
wide
the
moon
would
have
to
be
a
good
way
off
and
in
proportion
hard
to
see
if
however
we
would
satisfy
ourselves
with
a
moon
four
thousand
miles
away
that
could
be
seen
on
the
earth
surface
for
three
or
four
thousand
miles
on
each
side
and
twice
three
thousand
or
six
thousand
is
one
fourth
of
the
largest
circumference
of
the
earth
we
did
not
dare
have
it
nearer
than
four
thousand
miles
since
even
at
that
distance
it
would
be
eclipsed
three
hours
out
of
every
night
and
we
wanted
it
bright
and
distinct
and
not
of
that
lurid
copper
eclipse
color
but
at
four
thousand
miles
distance
the
moon
could
be
seen
by
a
belt
of
observers
six
or
eight
thousand
miles
in
diameter
start
then
two
moons
this
was
my
contribution
to
the
plan
suppose
one
over
the
meridian
of
greenwich
and
the
other
over
that
of
new
orleans
take
care
that
there
is
a
little
difference
in
the
radii
of
their
orbits
lest
they
some
foul
day
then
in
most
places
one
or
other
perhaps
two
will
come
in
sight
so
much
the
less
risk
of
clouds
and
everywhere
there
may
be
one
except
when
it
is
cloudy
neither
need
be
more
than
four
thousand
miles
off
so
much
the
larger
and
more
beautiful
will
they
be
if
on
the
old
thornbush
moon
old
herschel
with
his
reflector
could
see
a
two
hundred
feet
long
on
the
brick
moon
young
herschel
will
be
able
to
see
a
dab
of
mortar
a
foot
and
a
half
long
if
he
wants
to
and
people
without
the
reflector
with
their
will
be
able
to
see
sufficiently
well
and
to
this
they
agreed
that
eventually
there
must
be
two
brick
moons
indeed
it
were
better
that
there
should
be
four
as
each
must
be
below
the
horizon
half
the
time
that
is
only
as
many
as
jupiter
has
but
it
was
also
agreed
that
we
might
begin
with
one
why
we
settled
on
two
hundred
feet
of
diameter
i
hardly
know
i
think
it
was
from
the
statement
of
dear
john
farrar
about
the
impossibility
of
there
being
a
state
house
two
hundred
feet
long
not
yet
discovered
on
the
sunny
side
of
old
thornbush
that
somehow
made
two
hundred
our
fixed
point
besides
a
moon
of
two
hundred
feet
diameter
did
not
seem
quite
unmanageable
yet
it
was
evident
that
a
smaller
moon
would
be
of
no
use
unless
we
meant
to
have
them
near
the
world
when
there
would
be
so
many
that
they
would
be
confusing
and
eclipsed
most
of
the
time
and
four
thousand
miles
is
a
good
way
off
to
see
a
moon
even
two
hundred
feet
in
diameter
small
though
we
made
them
on
paper
these
moons
were
still
too
much
for
us
of
course
we
meant
to
build
them
hollow
but
even
if
hollow
there
must
be
some
thickness
and
the
quantity
of
brick
would
at
best
be
enormous
then
to
get
them
up
the
shooter
of
course
was
only
an
illustration
it
was
long
after
that
time
that
rodman
and
other
guns
sent
iron
balls
five
or
six
miles
in
distance
say
two
miles
more
or
less
in
height
iron
is
much
heavier
than
hollow
brick
but
you
can
build
no
gun
with
a
bore
of
two
hundred
feet
now
far
less
could
you
then
no
again
suggested
the
method
of
shooting
oft
the
moon
it
was
not
to
be
by
any
of
your
sudden
explosions
it
was
to
be
done
as
all
great
things
are
done
by
the
gradual
and
silent
accumulation
of
power
you
all
know
that
a
flywheel
heavy
very
heavy
on
the
circumference
light
very
light
within
it
was
made
to
save
up
power
from
the
time
when
it
was
produced
to
the
time
when
it
was
wanted
yes
then
before
we
began
even
to
build
the
moon
before
we
even
began
to
make
the
brick
we
would
build
two
gigantic
the
diameter
of
each
should
be
ever
so
great
the
circumference
heavy
beyond
all
precedent
and
thundering
strong
so
that
no
temptation
might
burst
it
they
should
revolve
their
edges
nearly
touching
in
opposite
directions
for
years
if
it
were
necessary
to
accumulate
power
driven
by
some
waterfall
now
wasted
to
the
world
one
should
be
a
little
heavier
than
the
other
when
the
brick
moon
was
finished
and
all
was
ready
it
should
be
gently
rolled
down
a
gigantic
groove
provided
for
it
till
it
lighted
on
the
edge
of
both
wheels
at
the
same
instant
of
course
it
would
not
rest
there
not
the
part
of
a
second
it
would
be
snapped
upward
as
a
drop
of
water
from
a
grindstone
upward
and
upward
but
the
heavier
wheel
would
have
deflected
it
a
little
from
the
vertical
upward
and
northward
it
would
rise
therefore
till
it
had
passed
the
axis
of
the
world
it
would
of
course
feel
the
world
attraction
all
the
time
which
would
bend
its
flight
gently
but
still
it
would
leave
the
world
more
and
more
behind
upward
still
but
now
southward
till
it
had
traversed
more
than
one
hundred
and
eighty
degrees
of
a
circle
little
resistance
indeed
after
it
had
cleared
the
forty
or
fifty
miles
of
visible
atmosphere
now
let
it
fall
said
inspired
with
the
vision
let
it
fall
and
the
sooner
the
better
the
curve
it
is
now
on
will
forever
clear
the
world
and
over
the
meridian
of
that
lonely
waterfall
if
only
we
have
rightly
adjusted
the
gigantic
flies
will
forever
revolve
in
its
obedient
orbit
the
brick
moon
the
blessing
of
all
seamen
as
constant
in
all
change
as
its
older
sister
has
been
fickle
and
the
second
cynosure
of
all
lovers
upon
the
waves
and
of
all
girls
left
behind
them
amen
we
cried
and
then
we
sat
in
silence
till
the
clock
struck
ten
then
shook
each
other
gravely
by
the
hand
and
left
the
south
middle
hall
of
waterfalls
there
were
plenty
that
we
knew
could
be
built
of
oak
and
pine
and
hooped
with
iron
did
not
discourage
us
but
brick
one
brick
is
say
cubic
inches
only
this
moon
though
we
made
it
hollow
see
it
must
take
twelve
million
brick
the
brick
alone
will
cost
sixty
thousand
dollars
the
brick
alone
would
cost
sixty
thousand
dollars
there
the
scheme
of
the
brick
moon
hung
an
airy
vision
for
seventeen
years
the
years
that
changed
us
from
young
men
into
men
the
brick
alone
sixty
thousand
dollars
for
to
boys
who
have
still
left
a
few
of
their
college
bills
unpaid
who
can
not
think
of
buying
that
lovely
little
elzevir
which
smith
has
for
sale
at
auction
of
which
smith
does
not
dream
of
the
value
sixty
thousand
dollars
seems
as
intangible
as
sixty
million
sestertia
clarke
second
how
much
are
sixty
million
sestertia
stated
in
cowries
how
much
in
currency
gold
being
at
right
go
up
stop
i
forget
myself
so
to
resume
the
project
of
the
brick
moon
hung
in
the
ideal
an
airy
vision
a
vision
as
lovely
and
as
distant
as
the
brick
moon
itself
at
this
calm
moment
of
midnight
when
i
write
as
it
poises
itself
over
the
shoulder
of
orion
in
my
southern
horizon
stop
i
anticipate
let
me
keep
as
we
say
in
beadle
dime
series
to
the
even
current
of
my
story
seventeen
years
passed
by
we
were
no
longer
boys
though
we
felt
so
for
myself
to
this
hour
i
never
enter
board
meeting
committee
meeting
or
synod
without
the
queer
question
what
would
happen
should
any
one
discover
that
this
bearded
man
was
only
a
big
boy
disguised
that
the
frockcoat
and
the
round
hat
are
none
of
mine
and
that
if
i
should
be
spurned
from
the
assembly
as
an
interloper
a
judicious
public
learning
all
the
facts
would
give
a
verdict
served
him
right
this
consideration
helps
me
through
many
bored
meetings
which
would
be
else
so
dismal
what
did
my
old
copy
say
boards
are
made
of
wood
they
are
long
and
narrow
but
we
do
not
get
on
seventeen
years
after
i
say
or
should
have
said
dear
orcutt
entered
my
room
at
naguadavick
again
i
had
not
seen
him
since
the
commencement
day
when
we
parted
at
cambridge
he
looked
the
same
and
yet
not
the
same
his
smile
was
the
same
his
voice
his
tender
look
of
sympathy
when
i
spoke
to
him
of
a
great
sorrow
his
childlike
love
of
fun
his
waistband
was
different
his
pantaloons
were
different
his
smooth
chin
was
buried
in
a
full
beard
and
he
weighed
two
hundred
pounds
if
he
weighed
a
gramme
o
the
good
time
we
had
so
like
the
times
of
old
those
were
happy
days
for
me
in
naguadavick
at
that
moment
my
double
was
at
work
for
me
at
a
meeting
of
the
publishing
committee
of
the
sandemanian
review
so
i
called
orcutt
up
to
my
own
snuggery
and
we
talked
over
old
times
talked
till
tea
was
ready
polly
came
up
through
the
orchard
and
made
tea
for
us
herself
there
we
talked
on
and
on
till
nine
ten
at
night
and
then
it
was
that
dear
orcutt
asked
me
if
i
remembered
the
brick
moon
remember
it
of
course
i
did
and
without
leaving
my
chair
i
opened
the
drawer
of
my
and
handed
him
a
portfolio
full
of
on
which
i
had
engaged
myself
for
my
third
all
that
winter
orcutt
was
delighted
he
turned
them
over
hastily
but
intelligently
and
said
i
am
so
glad
i
could
not
think
you
had
forgotten
and
i
have
seen
brannan
and
brannan
has
not
forgotten
now
do
you
know
said
he
in
all
this
railroading
of
mine
i
have
not
forgotten
when
i
built
the
great
tunnel
for
the
cattawissa
and
opelousas
by
which
we
got
rid
of
the
old
inclined
planes
there
was
never
a
stone
bigger
than
a
within
two
hundred
miles
of
us
i
baked
the
brick
of
that
tunnel
on
the
line
with
my
own
kilns
ingham
i
have
made
more
brick
i
believe
than
any
man
living
in
the
world
every
man
says
peabody
should
have
a
vocation
and
an
avocation
to
which
i
add
a
third
you
are
the
providential
man
said
i
am
i
not
fred
more
than
that
said
he
i
have
succeeded
in
things
the
world
counts
worth
more
than
brick
i
have
made
brick
and
i
have
made
money
one
of
us
make
money
asked
i
amazed
even
so
said
dear
orcutt
one
of
us
has
made
money
and
he
proceeded
to
tell
me
how
it
was
not
in
building
tunnels
nor
in
making
brick
no
it
was
by
buying
up
the
original
stock
of
the
cattawissa
and
opelousas
at
a
moment
when
that
stock
had
hardly
a
nominal
price
in
the
market
there
were
the
first
mortgage
bonds
and
the
second
mortgage
bonds
and
the
third
and
i
know
not
how
much
floating
debt
and
worse
than
all
the
reputation
of
the
road
lost
and
deservedly
lost
every
locomotive
it
had
was
asthmatic
every
car
it
had
bore
the
marks
of
unprecedented
accidents
for
which
no
one
was
to
blame
rival
lines
i
know
not
how
many
were
cutting
each
other
throats
for
its
legitimate
business
at
this
juncture
dear
george
invested
all
his
earnings
as
a
contractor
in
the
despised
original
stock
he
actually
bought
it
for
per
cent
good
shares
that
had
cost
a
round
hundred
to
every
wretch
who
had
subscribed
six
thousand
eight
hundred
dollars
every
cent
he
had
did
george
thus
invest
then
he
went
himself
to
the
trustees
of
the
first
mortgage
to
the
trustees
of
the
second
and
to
the
trustees
of
the
third
and
told
them
what
he
had
done
now
it
is
personal
presence
that
moves
the
world
dear
orcutt
has
found
that
out
since
if
he
did
not
know
it
before
the
trustees
who
would
have
sniffed
had
george
written
to
them
turned
round
from
their
desks
and
begged
him
to
take
a
chair
when
he
came
to
talk
with
them
had
he
put
every
penny
he
was
worth
into
that
stock
then
it
was
worth
something
which
they
did
not
know
of
for
george
orcutt
was
no
fool
about
railroads
the
man
who
bridged
the
lower
rapidan
when
a
freshet
was
running
was
no
fool
what
were
his
plans
george
did
not
tell
no
not
to
lordly
trustees
what
his
plans
were
he
had
plans
but
he
kept
them
to
himself
all
he
told
them
was
that
he
had
plans
on
those
plans
he
had
staked
his
all
now
would
they
or
would
they
not
agree
to
put
him
in
charge
of
the
running
of
that
road
for
twelve
months
on
a
nominal
salary
the
superintendent
they
had
had
was
a
rascal
he
had
proved
that
by
running
away
they
knew
that
george
was
not
a
rascal
he
knew
that
he
could
make
this
road
pay
expenses
pay
and
pay
a
dividend
a
thing
no
one
else
had
dreamed
of
for
twenty
years
could
they
do
better
than
try
him
of
course
they
could
not
and
they
knew
they
could
not
of
course
they
sniffed
and
talked
and
waited
and
pretended
they
did
not
know
and
that
they
must
consult
and
so
forth
and
so
on
but
of
course
they
all
did
try
him
on
his
own
terms
he
was
put
in
charge
of
the
running
of
that
road
in
one
week
he
showed
he
should
redeem
it
in
three
months
he
did
redeem
it
he
advertised
boldly
the
first
day
infant
children
at
treble
price
the
novelty
attracted
instant
remark
and
it
showed
many
things
first
it
showed
he
was
a
humane
man
who
wished
to
save
human
life
he
would
leave
these
innocents
in
their
cradles
where
they
belonged
second
and
chiefly
the
world
of
travellers
saw
that
the
crichton
the
amadis
the
perfect
chevalier
of
the
future
had
arisen
a
railroad
manager
caring
for
the
comfort
of
his
passengers
the
first
week
the
number
of
the
and
o
passengers
was
doubled
in
a
week
or
two
more
freight
began
to
come
in
in
driblets
on
the
line
which
its
owners
had
gone
over
as
soon
as
the
shops
could
turn
them
out
some
cars
were
put
on
with
arms
on
which
travellers
could
rest
their
elbows
with
where
they
could
take
naps
if
they
were
weary
these
excited
so
much
curiosity
that
one
was
exhibited
in
the
museum
at
cattawissa
and
another
at
opelousas
it
may
not
be
generally
known
that
the
received
car
of
the
american
roads
was
devised
to
secure
a
premium
offered
by
the
pawtucket
and
podunk
company
their
receipts
were
growing
so
large
that
they
feared
they
should
forfeit
their
charter
they
advertised
therefore
for
a
car
in
which
no
man
could
sleep
at
night
or
rest
by
day
in
which
the
backs
should
be
straight
the
heads
of
passengers
unsupported
the
feet
entangled
in
a
vice
the
elbows
always
knocked
by
the
passing
conductor
the
pattern
was
produced
which
immediately
came
into
use
on
all
the
american
roads
but
on
the
cattawissa
and
opelousas
this
pattern
was
set
aside
of
course
you
see
the
result
men
went
hundreds
of
miles
out
of
their
way
to
ride
on
the
and
o
the
third
mortgage
was
paid
off
a
reserve
fund
was
piled
up
for
the
second
the
trustees
of
the
first
lived
in
dread
of
being
paid
and
george
stock
which
he
bought
at
rose
to
before
two
years
had
gone
by
so
was
it
that
as
we
sat
together
in
the
snuggery
george
was
worth
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
some
of
his
eggs
were
in
the
basket
where
they
were
laid
some
he
had
taken
out
and
placed
in
other
baskets
some
in
nests
where
various
hens
were
brooding
over
them
sound
eggs
they
were
wherever
placed
and
such
was
the
victory
of
which
george
had
come
to
tell
one
of
us
had
made
money
on
his
way
he
had
seen
brannan
brannan
the
minded
shifty
man
of
tact
man
of
brain
man
of
heart
and
man
of
word
who
held
new
altona
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
brannan
had
made
no
money
not
he
nor
ever
will
but
brannan
could
do
much
what
he
pleased
in
this
world
without
money
for
whenever
brannan
studied
the
rights
and
the
wrongs
of
any
enterprise
all
men
knew
that
what
brannan
decided
about
it
was
the
eternal
truth
and
therefore
all
men
of
sense
were
accustomed
to
place
great
confidence
in
his
prophecies
but
more
than
this
and
better
brannan
was
an
unconscious
dog
who
believed
in
the
people
so
when
he
knew
what
was
the
right
and
what
was
the
wrong
he
could
stand
up
before
two
or
three
thousand
people
and
tell
them
what
was
right
and
what
was
wrong
and
tell
them
with
the
same
simplicity
and
freshness
with
which
he
would
talk
to
little
horace
on
his
knee
of
the
thousands
who
heard
him
there
would
not
be
one
in
a
hundred
who
knew
that
this
was
eloquence
they
were
fain
to
say
as
they
sat
in
their
shops
talking
that
brannan
was
not
eloquent
nay
they
went
so
far
as
to
regret
that
brannan
was
not
eloquent
if
he
were
only
as
eloquent
as
carker
was
or
as
barker
was
how
excellent
he
would
be
but
when
a
month
after
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
do
anything
about
the
thing
he
had
been
speaking
of
they
did
what
brannan
had
told
them
to
do
forgetting
most
likely
that
he
had
ever
told
them
and
fancying
that
these
were
their
own
ideas
which
in
fact
had
from
his
liquid
ponderous
transparent
and
invisible
common
sense
distilled
unconsciously
into
their
being
i
wonder
whether
brannan
ever
knew
that
he
was
eloquent
what
i
knew
and
what
dear
george
knew
was
that
he
was
one
of
the
leaders
of
men
courage
my
friends
we
are
steadily
advancing
to
the
brick
moon
for
george
had
stopped
and
seen
brannan
and
brannan
had
not
forgotten
seventeen
years
brannan
had
remembered
and
not
a
ship
had
been
lost
on
a
because
her
longitude
was
wrong
not
a
baby
had
wailed
its
last
as
it
was
ground
between
wrecked
spar
and
cruel
rock
not
a
swollen
corpse
unknown
had
been
flung
up
upon
the
sand
and
been
buried
with
a
nameless
epitaph
but
brannan
had
recollected
the
brick
moon
and
had
in
the
which
rejected
nothing
stored
away
the
story
of
the
horror
and
now
george
was
ready
to
consecrate
a
round
hundred
thousand
to
the
building
of
the
moon
and
brannan
was
ready
in
the
thousand
ways
in
which
wise
men
move
the
people
to
and
fro
to
persuade
them
to
give
to
us
a
hundred
thousand
more
and
george
had
come
to
ask
me
if
i
were
not
ready
to
undertake
with
them
the
final
great
effort
of
which
our
old
calculations
were
the
embryo
for
this
i
was
now
to
contribute
the
mathematical
certainty
and
the
lore
borrowed
from
naval
science
which
should
blossom
and
bear
fruit
when
the
brick
moon
was
snapped
like
a
cherry
from
the
ways
on
which
it
was
built
was
launched
into
the
air
by
power
gathered
from
a
thousand
freshets
and
poised
at
last
in
its
own
region
of
the
ether
should
begin
its
course
of
eternal
blessings
in
one
unchanging
meridian
vision
of
beneficence
and
wonder
of
course
i
consented
oh
that
you
were
not
so
eager
for
the
end
oh
that
i
might
tell
you
what
now
you
will
never
know
of
the
great
campaign
which
we
then
and
there
inaugurated
how
the
horrible
loss
of
the
royal
martyr
whose
longitude
was
three
degrees
awry
startled
the
whole
world
and
gave
us
a
point
to
start
from
how
i
explained
to
george
that
he
must
not
subscribe
the
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
a
moment
it
must
come
in
bits
when
the
cause
needed
a
stimulus
or
the
public
needed
encouragement
how
we
caught
neophyte
editors
and
explained
to
them
enough
to
make
them
think
the
moon
was
their
own
invention
and
their
own
thunder
how
beginning
in
boston
we
sent
round
to
all
the
men
of
science
all
those
of
philanthropy
and
all
those
of
commerce
three
thousand
circulars
inviting
them
to
a
private
meeting
at
george
parlors
at
the
revere
how
besides
ourselves
and
some
nice
old
gentlemen
brannan
had
brought
over
from
podunk
with
him
paying
their
fares
both
ways
there
were
present
only
three
men
all
adventurers
whose
projects
had
failed
besides
the
representatives
of
the
press
how
of
these
representatives
some
understood
the
whole
and
some
understood
nothing
how
the
next
day
all
gave
us
notices
how
a
few
days
after
in
the
lower
horticultural
hall
we
had
our
first
public
meeting
how
haliburton
brought
us
fifty
people
who
loved
him
his
bible
class
most
of
them
to
help
fill
up
how
besides
these
there
were
not
three
persons
whom
we
had
not
asked
personally
or
one
who
could
invent
an
excuse
to
stay
away
how
we
had
hung
the
walls
with
intelligible
and
unintelligible
diagrams
how
i
opened
the
meeting
of
that
meeting
indeed
i
must
tell
something
first
i
spoke
i
did
not
pretend
to
unfold
the
scheme
i
did
not
attempt
any
rhetoric
but
i
did
not
make
any
apologies
i
told
them
simply
of
the
dangers
of
i
told
them
when
they
were
most
dangerous
when
seamen
came
upon
them
unawares
i
explained
to
them
that
though
the
costly
chronometer
frequently
adjusted
made
a
delusive
guide
to
the
voyager
who
often
made
a
harbor
still
the
adjustment
was
treacherous
the
instrument
beyond
the
use
of
the
poor
and
that
once
astray
its
error
increased
forever
i
said
that
we
believed
we
had
a
method
which
if
the
means
were
supplied
for
the
experiment
would
give
the
humblest
fisherman
the
very
certainty
of
sunrise
and
of
sunset
in
his
calculations
of
his
place
upon
the
world
and
i
said
that
whenever
a
man
knew
his
place
in
this
world
it
was
always
likely
all
would
go
well
then
i
sat
down
then
dear
george
spoke
simply
but
very
briefly
he
said
he
was
a
stranger
to
the
boston
people
and
that
those
who
knew
him
at
all
knew
he
was
not
a
talking
man
he
was
a
civil
engineer
and
his
business
was
to
calculate
and
to
build
and
not
to
talk
but
he
had
come
here
to
say
that
he
had
studied
this
new
plan
for
the
longitude
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
and
that
he
believed
in
it
through
and
through
there
was
his
opinion
if
that
was
worth
anything
to
anybody
if
that
meeting
resolved
to
go
forward
with
the
enterprise
or
if
anybody
proposed
to
he
should
offer
his
services
in
any
capacity
and
without
any
pay
for
its
success
if
he
might
only
work
as
a
bricklayer
he
would
work
as
a
bricklayer
for
he
believed
on
his
soul
that
the
success
of
this
enterprise
promised
more
for
mankind
than
any
enterprise
which
was
ever
likely
to
call
for
the
devotion
of
his
life
and
to
the
good
of
mankind
he
said
very
simply
my
life
is
devoted
then
he
sat
down
then
brannan
got
up
up
to
this
time
excepting
that
george
had
dropped
this
hint
about
bricklaying
nobody
had
said
a
word
about
the
moon
far
less
hinted
what
it
was
to
be
made
of
so
ben
had
the
whole
to
open
he
did
it
as
if
he
had
been
talking
to
a
bright
boy
of
ten
years
old
he
made
those
people
think
that
he
respected
them
as
his
equals
but
in
fact
he
chose
every
word
as
if
not
one
of
them
knew
anything
he
explained
as
if
it
were
rather
more
simple
to
explain
than
to
take
for
granted
but
he
explained
as
if
were
they
talking
they
might
be
explaining
to
him
he
led
them
from
point
to
point
oh
so
much
more
clearly
than
i
have
been
leading
you
till
as
their
mouths
dropped
a
little
open
in
their
eager
interest
and
their
lids
forgot
to
wink
in
their
gaze
upon
his
face
and
so
their
eyebrows
seemed
a
little
lifted
in
curiosity
till
i
say
each
man
felt
as
if
he
were
himself
the
inventor
who
had
bridged
difficulty
after
difficulty
as
if
indeed
the
whole
were
too
simple
to
be
called
difficult
or
complicated
the
only
wonder
was
that
the
board
of
longitude
or
the
emperor
napoleon
or
the
smithsonian
or
somebody
had
not
sent
this
little
planet
on
its
voyage
of
blessing
long
before
not
a
syllable
that
you
would
have
called
rhetoric
not
a
word
that
you
would
have
thought
prepared
and
then
brannan
sat
down
that
was
ben
brannan
way
for
my
part
i
like
it
better
than
eloquence
then
i
got
up
again
we
would
answer
any
questions
i
said
we
represented
people
who
were
eager
to
go
forward
with
this
work
alas
except
all
of
those
represented
were
on
the
stage
we
could
not
go
forward
without
the
general
assistance
of
the
community
it
was
not
an
enterprise
which
the
government
could
be
asked
to
favor
it
was
not
an
enterprise
which
would
yield
one
penny
of
profit
to
any
human
being
we
had
therefore
purely
on
the
ground
of
its
benefit
to
mankind
brought
it
before
an
assembly
of
boston
men
and
women
then
there
was
a
pause
and
we
could
hear
our
watches
tick
and
our
hearts
beat
dear
george
asked
me
in
a
whisper
if
he
should
say
anything
more
but
i
thought
not
the
pause
became
painful
and
then
tom
coram
prince
of
merchants
rose
had
any
calculation
been
made
of
the
probable
cost
of
the
experiment
of
one
moon
i
said
the
calculations
were
on
the
table
the
brick
alone
would
cost
orcutt
had
computed
that
would
complete
two
flywheels
and
one
moon
this
made
no
allowance
for
whitewashing
the
moon
which
was
not
strictly
necessary
the
and
would
be
equally
valuable
for
the
succeeding
moons
it
any
were
attempted
and
therefore
the
second
moon
could
be
turned
off
it
was
hoped
for
thomas
coram
had
been
standing
all
the
time
i
spoke
and
in
an
instant
he
said
i
am
no
mathematician
but
i
have
had
a
ship
ground
to
pieces
under
me
on
the
laccadives
because
our
chronometer
was
wrong
you
need
to
build
your
first
moon
i
will
be
one
of
twenty
men
to
furnish
the
money
or
i
will
pay
for
this
purpose
to
any
person
who
may
be
named
as
treasurer
to
be
repaid
to
me
if
the
moon
is
not
finished
this
day
twenty
years
that
was
as
long
a
speech
as
tom
coram
ever
made
but
it
was
pointed
the
small
audience
tapped
applause
orcutt
looked
at
me
and
i
nodded
i
will
be
another
of
the
twenty
men
cried
he
and
i
another
said
an
old
bluff
englishman
whom
nobody
had
invited
who
proved
to
be
a
robert
boll
a
sheffield
man
who
came
in
from
curiosity
he
stopped
after
the
meeting
said
he
should
leave
the
country
the
next
week
and
i
have
never
seen
him
since
but
his
bill
of
exchange
came
all
the
same
that
was
all
the
public
subscribing
enough
more
than
we
had
hoped
for
we
tried
to
make
coram
treasurer
but
he
refused
we
had
to
make
haliburton
treasurer
though
we
should
have
liked
a
man
better
known
than
he
then
was
then
we
adjourned
some
nice
ladies
then
came
up
and
gave
one
a
dollar
and
one
five
dollars
and
one
fifty
and
so
on
and
some
men
who
have
stuck
by
ever
since
i
always
in
my
own
mind
call
each
of
those
women
damaris
and
each
of
those
men
dionysius
but
those
are
not
their
real
names
how
i
am
wasting
time
on
an
old
story
then
some
of
these
ladies
came
the
next
day
and
proposed
a
fair
and
out
of
that
six
months
after
grew
the
great
longitude
fair
that
you
will
all
remember
if
you
went
to
it
i
am
sure
and
the
papers
the
next
day
gave
us
reports
and
then
two
by
two
with
our
books
we
went
at
it
but
i
must
not
tell
the
details
of
that
subscription
there
were
two
or
three
men
who
subscribed
each
because
they
were
perfectly
certain
the
amount
would
never
be
raised
they
wanted
for
once
to
get
the
credit
of
liberality
for
nothing
there
were
many
men
and
many
women
who
subscribed
from
one
dollar
up
to
one
thousand
not
because
they
cared
a
straw
for
the
longitude
nor
because
they
believed
in
the
least
in
the
project
but
because
they
believed
in
brannan
in
orcutt
in
or
in
me
love
goes
far
in
this
world
of
ours
some
few
men
subscribed
because
others
had
done
it
it
was
the
thing
to
do
and
they
must
not
be
out
of
fashion
and
three
or
four
at
least
subscribed
because
each
hour
of
their
lives
there
came
up
the
memory
of
the
day
when
the
news
came
that
the
was
lost
george
or
harry
or
john
in
the
and
they
knew
that
george
or
harry
or
john
might
have
been
at
home
had
it
been
easier
than
it
is
to
read
the
courses
of
the
stars
fair
subscriptions
and
orcutt
reserve
we
counted
up
or
nearly
so
there
would
be
a
little
more
when
all
was
paid
in
but
we
could
not
use
a
cent
except
orcutt
and
our
own
little
subscriptions
till
we
had
got
the
whole
and
at
this
point
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
world
was
sick
of
us
and
that
we
had
gathered
every
penny
that
was
in
store
for
us
the
orange
was
squeezed
dry
ii
how
we
built
it
the
orange
was
squeezed
dry
and
how
little
any
of
us
knew
skilful
george
orcutt
thoughtful
ben
brannan
loyal
haliburton
ingenious
or
poor
painstaking
i
how
little
we
knew
or
any
of
us
where
was
another
orange
or
how
we
could
mix
malic
acid
and
tartaric
acid
and
citric
acid
and
auric
acid
and
sugar
and
water
so
as
to
imitate
and
fill
up
the
enough
to
draw
in
the
conditioned
subscriptions
and
so
begin
to
build
the
moon
how
often
as
i
lay
awake
at
night
have
i
added
up
the
different
subscriptions
in
some
new
order
as
if
that
would
help
the
matter
and
how
steadily
they
have
come
out
one
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
or
even
less
when
i
must
needs
in
my
sleepiness
forget
somebody
name
so
haliburton
put
into
railroad
stocks
all
the
money
he
collected
and
the
rest
of
us
ground
on
at
our
mills
or
flew
up
on
our
own
wings
towards
heaven
thus
orcutt
built
more
tunnels
prepared
for
more
commencements
haliburton
calculated
more
policies
ben
brannan
created
more
civilization
and
i
as
i
could
healed
the
hurt
of
my
people
of
naguadavick
for
the
months
there
were
left
to
me
of
my
stay
in
that
thriving
town
none
of
us
had
the
wit
to
see
how
the
problem
was
to
be
wrought
out
further
no
the
best
things
come
to
us
when
we
have
faithfully
and
well
made
all
the
preparation
and
done
our
best
but
they
come
in
some
way
that
is
none
of
ours
so
was
it
now
that
to
build
the
brick
moon
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
be
turned
out
of
naguadavick
ignominiously
and
that
jeff
davis
and
some
seven
or
eight
other
bad
men
should
create
the
great
rebellion
hear
how
it
happened
dennis
shea
my
double
otherwise
indeed
called
by
my
name
and
legally
so
undid
me
as
my
friends
supposed
one
evening
at
a
public
meeting
called
by
poor
isaacs
in
naguadavick
of
that
transaction
i
have
no
occasion
here
to
tell
the
story
but
of
that
transaction
one
consequence
is
that
the
brick
moon
now
moves
in
ether
i
stop
writing
to
rest
my
eye
upon
it
through
a
little
telescope
of
alvan
clark
here
which
is
always
trained
near
it
it
is
moving
on
as
placidly
as
ever
it
came
about
thus
the
morning
after
poor
dennis
whom
i
have
long
since
forgiven
made
his
extraordinary
speeches
without
any
authority
from
me
in
the
town
hall
at
naguadavick
i
thought
and
my
wife
agreed
with
me
that
we
had
better
both
leave
town
with
the
children
auchmuty
our
dear
friend
thought
so
too
we
left
in
the
seven
accommodation
for
skowhegan
and
so
came
to
township
no
in
the
range
and
there
for
years
we
resided
that
whole
range
of
townships
was
set
off
under
a
provision
admirable
in
its
character
that
the
first
settled
minister
in
each
town
should
receive
one
hundred
acres
of
land
as
the
minister
grant
and
the
first
settled
schoolmaster
eighty
to
no
therefore
i
came
i
constituted
a
little
sandemanian
church
auchmuty
and
delafield
came
up
and
installed
me
and
with
these
hands
i
built
the
cabin
in
which
with
polly
and
the
little
ones
i
have
since
spent
many
happy
nights
and
days
this
is
not
the
place
for
me
to
publish
a
map
which
i
have
by
me
of
no
nor
an
account
of
its
many
advantages
for
settlers
should
i
ever
print
my
papers
called
robinsons
it
will
be
easy
with
them
to
explain
its
topography
and
geography
suffice
it
now
to
say
that
with
alice
and
bertha
and
polly
i
took
tramps
up
and
down
through
the
roads
and
soon
knew
the
general
features
of
the
lay
of
the
land
nor
was
it
long
of
course
before
we
came
out
one
day
upon
the
curious
which
have
more
than
once
averted
the
flow
of
the
little
carrotook
river
where
it
has
washed
the
rocks
away
so
far
as
to
let
down
one
section
more
of
the
overlying
yielding
yellow
clay
think
how
my
eyes
flashed
and
my
wife
as
struggling
though
a
wilderness
of
moosewood
we
came
out
one
afternoon
on
this
front
of
yellow
clay
yellow
clay
of
course
when
properly
treated
by
fire
is
brick
here
we
were
surrounded
by
forests
only
waiting
to
be
burned
yonder
was
clay
only
waiting
to
be
baked
polly
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
at
her
and
with
one
voice
we
cried
out
the
moon
for
here
was
this
shouting
river
at
our
feet
whose
power
had
been
running
to
waste
since
the
day
when
the
laurentian
hills
first
heaved
themselves
above
the
hot
atlantic
and
that
day
i
am
informed
by
agassiz
was
the
first
day
in
the
history
of
this
solid
world
here
was
enough
for
forty
were
it
necessary
to
send
heavenward
twenty
moons
here
was
solid
timber
enough
for
a
hundred
dams
yet
only
one
was
necessary
to
give
motion
to
the
here
was
retirement
freedom
from
criticism
an
escape
from
the
journalists
who
would
not
embarrass
us
by
telling
of
every
cracked
brick
which
had
to
be
rejected
from
the
structure
we
had
lived
in
no
now
for
six
weeks
and
not
an
own
correspondent
of
them
all
had
yet
told
what
rev
ingham
had
for
dinner
of
course
i
wrote
to
george
orcutt
at
once
of
our
great
discovery
and
he
came
up
at
once
to
examine
the
situation
on
the
whole
it
pleased
him
he
could
not
take
the
site
i
proposed
for
the
dam
because
this
very
clay
there
made
the
channel
treacherous
and
there
was
danger
that
the
stream
would
work
out
a
new
career
but
lower
down
we
found
a
stony
gorge
with
which
george
was
satisfied
he
traced
out
a
line
for
a
railway
by
which
of
their
own
weight
the
could
run
to
the
centrings
he
showed
us
where
with
some
excavations
the
could
be
placed
exactly
above
the
great
wheels
that
no
power
might
be
wasted
and
explained
to
us
how
when
the
gigantic
structure
was
finished
the
brick
moon
would
gently
roll
down
its
ways
upon
the
rapid
wheels
to
be
launched
instant
into
the
sky
shall
i
ever
forget
that
happy
october
day
of
anticipation
we
spent
many
of
those
october
days
in
tentative
surveys
alice
and
bertha
were
our
intelligent
and
obedient
i
drove
for
george
his
stakes
or
i
cut
away
his
brush
or
i
raised
and
lowered
the
shield
at
which
he
sighted
and
at
noon
polly
appeared
with
her
baskets
and
we
would
dine
al
fresco
on
a
pretty
point
which
not
many
months
after
was
wholly
covered
by
the
eastern
end
of
the
dam
when
the
work
was
finished
we
retired
to
the
cabin
for
days
and
calculated
and
drew
and
drew
and
calculated
estimates
for
feeding
irishmen
estimates
of
hay
for
mules
george
was
sure
he
could
work
mules
better
than
oxen
estimates
for
cement
estimates
for
the
preliminary
estimates
for
rail
for
the
little
for
wheels
for
spikes
and
for
cutting
ties
what
did
we
not
estimate
for
on
a
basis
almost
wholly
new
you
will
observe
for
here
the
brick
would
cost
us
less
than
our
old
conceptions
our
cost
us
almost
nothing
but
our
stores
and
our
wages
would
cost
us
much
more
these
estimates
are
now
to
me
very
curious
a
monument
indeed
to
dear
george
memory
that
in
the
result
they
proved
so
accurate
i
would
gladly
print
them
here
at
length
with
some
illustrative
cuts
but
that
i
know
the
impatience
of
the
public
and
its
indifference
to
detail
if
we
are
ever
able
to
print
a
proper
memorial
of
george
that
perhaps
will
be
the
fitter
place
for
them
suffice
it
to
say
that
with
the
subtractions
thus
made
from
the
original
estimates
even
with
the
additions
forced
upon
us
by
working
in
a
wilderness
george
was
satisfied
that
a
money
charge
of
would
build
and
start
the
moon
as
soon
as
we
had
determined
the
site
we
marked
off
eighty
acres
which
contained
all
the
essential
localities
up
and
down
the
little
carrotook
river
i
engaged
george
for
the
first
schoolmaster
in
no
and
he
took
these
eighty
acres
for
the
schoolmaster
reservation
alice
and
bertha
went
to
school
to
him
the
next
day
taking
lessons
in
civil
engineering
and
i
wrote
to
the
bingham
trustees
to
notify
them
that
i
had
engaged
a
teacher
and
that
he
had
selected
his
land
of
course
we
remembered
still
that
we
were
near
forty
thousand
dollars
short
of
the
new
estimates
and
also
that
much
of
our
money
would
not
be
paid
us
but
on
condition
that
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
were
raised
but
george
said
that
his
own
subscription
was
wholly
unhampered
with
that
we
would
go
to
work
on
the
preliminary
work
of
the
dam
and
on
the
flies
then
if
the
flies
would
hold
together
and
they
should
hold
if
mortise
and
iron
could
hold
them
they
might
be
at
work
summers
and
winters
days
and
nights
storing
up
power
for
us
this
would
encourage
the
subscribers
it
would
encourage
us
and
all
this
preliminary
work
would
be
out
of
the
way
when
we
were
really
ready
to
begin
upon
the
moon
brannan
haliburton
and
readily
agreed
to
this
when
they
were
consulted
they
were
the
other
trustees
under
an
instrument
which
we
had
got
leger
to
draw
up
george
gave
up
as
soon
as
he
might
his
other
appointments
and
taught
me
meanwhile
where
and
how
i
was
to
rig
a
little
to
cut
some
necessary
lumber
i
engaged
a
gang
of
men
to
cut
the
timber
for
the
dam
and
to
have
it
ready
and
with
the
next
spring
we
were
well
at
work
on
the
dam
and
on
the
flies
these
needed
of
course
the
most
solid
foundation
the
least
irregularity
of
their
movement
might
send
the
moon
awry
the
leger
of
these
stories
was
francis
brown
hayes
ah
me
would
i
not
gladly
tell
the
history
of
every
bar
of
iron
which
was
bent
into
the
tires
of
those
flies
and
of
every
log
which
was
mortised
into
its
place
in
the
dam
nay
of
every
curling
mass
of
foam
which
played
in
the
eddies
beneath
when
the
dam
was
finished
and
the
waste
water
ran
so
smoothly
over
alas
that
one
drop
should
be
wasted
of
water
that
might
move
a
world
although
a
small
one
i
almost
dare
say
that
i
remember
each
and
all
these
with
such
hope
and
happiness
did
i
lend
myself
as
i
could
each
day
to
the
great
enterprise
lending
to
dear
george
who
was
here
and
there
and
everywhere
and
was
this
and
that
and
everybody
lending
to
him
i
say
such
poor
help
as
i
could
lend
in
whatever
way
we
waked
in
the
two
cabins
in
those
happy
days
just
before
the
sun
came
up
when
the
birds
were
in
their
loudest
clamor
of
morning
joy
wrapped
each
in
a
blanket
george
and
i
stepped
out
from
our
doors
each
trying
to
call
the
other
and
often
meeting
on
the
grass
between
we
ran
to
the
river
and
plunged
in
oh
how
cold
it
was
laughed
and
screamed
like
boys
rubbed
ourselves
aglow
and
ran
home
to
build
polly
fire
beneath
the
open
chimney
which
stood
beside
my
cabin
the
bread
had
risen
in
the
night
the
water
soon
boiled
above
the
logs
the
children
came
laughing
out
upon
the
grass
barefoot
and
fearless
of
the
dew
then
polly
appeared
with
her
gridiron
and
or
with
her
griddle
and
eggs
and
in
fewer
minutes
than
this
page
has
cost
me
the
breakfast
was
ready
for
alice
to
carry
dish
by
dish
to
the
table
on
the
piazza
not
raphael
and
adam
more
enjoyed
their
watermelons
and
late
blueberries
and
in
the
long
croon
of
the
breakfast
we
revenged
ourselves
for
the
haste
with
which
it
had
been
prepared
when
we
were
well
at
table
a
horn
from
the
cabins
below
sounded
the
reveille
for
the
drowsier
workmen
soon
above
the
larches
rose
the
blue
of
their
smokes
and
when
we
were
at
last
nodding
to
the
children
to
say
that
they
might
leave
the
table
and
polly
was
folding
her
napkin
as
to
say
she
wished
we
were
gone
we
would
see
tall
asaph
langdon
then
foreman
of
the
carpenters
sauntering
up
the
valley
with
a
roll
of
paper
or
an
adze
or
a
shingle
with
some
calculations
on
it
with
something
on
which
he
wanted
orcutt
directions
for
the
day
an
hour
of
nothings
set
the
carnal
machinery
of
the
day
agoing
we
fed
the
horses
the
cows
the
pigs
and
the
hens
we
collected
the
eggs
and
cleaned
the
houses
and
the
barns
we
brought
in
wood
enough
for
the
day
fire
and
water
enough
for
the
day
cooking
and
cleanliness
these
heads
describe
what
i
and
the
children
did
polly
life
during
that
hour
was
more
mysterious
that
great
first
hour
of
the
day
is
devoted
with
women
to
the
deepest
arcana
of
the
eleusinian
mysteries
of
the
divine
science
of
housekeeping
she
who
can
meet
the
requisitions
of
that
hour
wisely
and
bravely
conquers
in
the
day
battle
but
what
she
does
in
it
let
no
man
try
to
say
it
can
be
named
but
not
described
in
the
comprehensive
formula
just
stepping
round
that
hour
well
given
to
chores
and
to
digestion
the
children
went
to
orcutt
school
and
i
to
my
rustic
study
a
separate
cabin
with
a
rough
square
table
in
it
and
some
equally
rude
no
man
entered
it
excepting
george
and
me
here
for
two
hours
i
worked
undisturbed
how
happy
the
world
had
it
neither
postman
nor
worked
upon
my
traces
of
sandemanianism
in
the
sixth
and
seventh
centuries
and
then
was
ready
to
render
such
service
to
the
cause
and
to
george
as
the
day
might
demand
thus
i
rode
to
lincoln
or
to
foxcroft
to
order
supplies
i
took
my
gun
and
lay
in
wait
on
chairback
for
a
bear
i
transferred
to
the
hewn
lumber
the
angles
or
bevels
from
the
careful
drawings
as
best
i
could
i
filled
an
apostle
part
and
became
all
things
to
all
these
men
around
me
happy
those
days
and
thus
the
dam
was
built
in
such
arcadian
simplicity
was
reared
the
mighty
wheel
thus
grew
on
each
side
the
towers
which
were
to
support
the
flies
and
thus
to
our
delight
not
unmixed
with
wonder
at
last
we
saw
those
mighty
flies
begin
to
turn
not
in
one
day
nor
in
ten
but
in
a
year
or
two
of
happy
life
full
of
the
joy
of
joys
the
joy
of
eventful
living
yet
for
all
this
was
not
far
less
was
it
and
but
for
jeff
davis
and
his
crew
the
brick
moon
would
not
have
been
born
but
at
last
jeff
davis
was
ready
my
preparations
being
completed
wrote
general
beauregard
i
opened
fire
on
fort
sumter
little
did
he
know
it
but
in
that
explosion
the
brick
moon
also
was
lifted
into
the
sky
little
did
we
know
it
when
four
weeks
after
george
came
up
from
the
settlements
all
excited
with
the
news
the
wheels
had
been
turning
now
for
four
days
faster
of
course
and
faster
george
had
gone
down
for
money
to
pay
off
the
men
and
he
brought
us
up
the
news
that
the
rebellion
had
begun
the
last
of
this
happy
life
he
said
the
last
alas
of
our
dear
moon
how
little
he
knew
and
we
but
he
paid
off
the
men
and
they
packed
their
traps
and
disappeared
and
before
two
months
were
over
were
in
the
lines
before
the
enemy
george
packed
up
bade
us
sadly
and
before
a
week
had
offered
his
service
to
governor
fenton
in
albany
for
us
it
took
rather
longer
but
we
were
soon
packed
polly
took
the
children
to
her
sister
and
i
went
on
to
the
department
to
offer
my
service
there
no
sign
of
life
left
in
no
but
the
two
gigantic
moving
faster
and
faster
by
day
and
by
night
and
accumulating
power
till
it
was
needed
if
only
they
would
hold
together
till
the
moment
came
so
we
all
ground
through
the
first
slow
year
of
the
war
george
in
his
place
i
in
mine
brannan
in
his
we
lifted
as
we
could
but
how
heavy
the
weight
seemed
it
was
in
the
second
year
when
the
second
large
loan
was
placed
that
haliburton
wrote
to
me
i
got
the
letter
i
think
at
hilton
head
that
he
had
sold
out
every
penny
of
our
railroad
stocks
at
the
high
prices
which
railroad
stocks
then
bore
and
had
invested
the
whole
thousand
in
the
new
governments
i
could
not
call
a
board
meeting
said
haliburton
for
i
am
here
only
on
leave
of
absence
and
the
rest
are
all
away
but
the
case
is
clear
enough
if
the
government
goes
up
the
moon
will
never
go
up
and
for
one
i
do
not
look
beyond
the
veil
so
he
wrote
to
us
all
and
of
course
we
all
approved
so
it
was
that
jeff
davis
also
served
deep
must
that
man
go
into
the
pit
who
does
not
serve
though
unconscious
for
thus
it
was
that
in
the
fourth
year
of
the
war
when
gold
was
at
haliburton
was
receiving
on
his
thousand
dollars
seventeen
per
cent
interest
in
currency
thus
was
it
that
before
the
war
was
over
he
had
piled
up
compounding
his
interest
more
than
fifty
per
cent
addition
to
his
capital
thus
was
it
that
as
soon
as
peace
came
all
his
stocks
were
at
a
handsome
percentage
thus
was
it
that
before
i
returned
from
south
america
he
reported
to
all
the
subscribers
that
the
full
was
secured
thus
was
it
that
when
i
returned
after
that
long
cruise
of
mine
in
the
florida
i
found
polly
and
the
children
again
at
no
george
there
also
directing
a
working
party
of
nearly
eighty
bricklayers
and
hodmen
the
lower
centrings
nigh
filled
to
their
diameter
and
the
brick
moon
to
the
eye
seeming
almost
half
completed
here
it
is
that
i
regret
most
of
all
that
i
can
not
print
the
with
this
paper
if
you
will
cut
open
the
of
spergularia
rubra
or
any
other
carpel
that
has
a
free
central
placenta
and
observe
how
the
circular
seeds
cling
around
the
circular
centre
you
will
have
some
idea
of
the
arrangement
of
a
transverse
horizontal
section
of
the
completed
moon
lay
three
on
the
piazza
and
call
one
or
two
of
the
children
to
help
you
poise
seven
in
one
plane
above
the
three
then
let
another
child
place
three
more
above
the
seven
and
you
have
the
core
of
the
moon
completely
if
you
want
a
more
poetical
illustration
it
was
what
wordsworth
calls
a
mass
of
conglobated
bubbles
undissolved
any
section
through
any
diameter
looked
like
an
immense
of
six
circles
grouped
round
a
seventh
in
truth
each
of
these
sections
would
reveal
the
existence
of
seven
chambers
in
the
moon
each
a
sphere
itself
whose
arches
gave
solidity
to
the
whole
while
yet
of
the
whole
moon
the
greater
part
was
air
in
all
there
were
thirteen
of
these
moonlets
if
i
am
so
to
call
them
though
no
one
section
of
course
would
reveal
so
many
sustained
on
each
side
by
their
groined
arches
the
surface
of
the
whole
moon
was
built
over
them
and
under
them
simply
two
domes
connected
at
the
bases
the
chambers
themselves
were
made
lighter
by
leaving
large
round
windows
or
open
circles
in
the
parts
of
their
vaults
farthest
from
their
points
of
contact
so
that
each
of
them
looked
not
unlike
the
outer
sphere
of
a
japanese
ivory
nest
of
concentric
balls
you
see
the
object
was
to
make
a
moon
which
when
left
to
its
own
gravity
should
be
fitly
supported
or
braced
within
dear
george
was
sure
that
by
this
constant
repetition
of
arches
we
should
with
the
least
weight
unite
the
greatest
strength
i
believe
it
still
and
experience
has
proved
that
there
is
strength
enough
when
i
went
up
to
no
on
my
return
from
south
america
i
found
the
lower
centring
up
and
half
full
of
the
who
were
really
keltic
laborers
all
busy
in
bringing
up
the
lower
of
the
shell
this
lower
centring
was
of
wood
in
form
exactly
like
a
roman
amphitheatre
if
the
seats
of
it
be
circular
on
this
the
lower
or
inverted
brick
dome
was
laid
the
whole
fabric
was
on
one
of
the
terraces
which
were
heaved
up
in
some
old
geological
cataclysm
when
some
lake
gave
way
and
the
carrotook
river
was
born
the
level
was
higher
than
that
of
the
top
of
the
which
with
an
awful
velocity
now
were
circling
in
their
wild
career
in
the
ravine
below
three
of
the
lowest
moonlets
as
i
have
called
them
separate
if
you
take
my
other
illustration
had
been
completed
their
centrings
had
been
taken
to
pieces
and
drawn
out
through
the
holes
and
were
now
set
up
again
with
other
new
centrings
for
the
second
story
of
cells
i
was
received
with
wonder
and
delight
i
had
telegraphed
my
arrival
but
the
despatches
had
never
been
forwarded
from
skowhegan
of
course
we
all
had
a
deal
to
tell
and
for
me
there
was
no
end
to
inquiries
which
i
had
to
make
in
turn
i
was
never
tired
of
exploring
the
various
spheres
and
the
nameless
spaces
between
them
i
was
never
tired
of
talking
with
the
laborers
all
of
us
indeed
became
skilful
bricklayers
and
on
a
pleasant
afternoon
you
might
see
alice
and
bertha
and
george
and
me
all
laying
brick
together
polly
sitting
in
the
shade
of
some
wall
which
had
been
built
high
enough
and
reading
to
us
from
jean
ingelow
or
or
jane
austen
while
little
clara
brought
to
us
our
mortar
happily
and
lightly
went
by
that
summer
haliburton
and
his
wife
made
us
a
visit
ben
brannan
brought
up
his
wife
and
children
haliburton
herself
put
in
the
keystone
to
the
central
chamber
which
had
always
been
named
g
on
the
plans
and
at
her
suggestion
it
was
named
grace
now
because
her
name
was
hannah
before
winter
we
had
passed
the
diameter
of
i
j
and
k
the
three
uppermost
cells
of
all
and
the
surrounding
shell
was
closing
in
upon
them
on
the
whole
the
funds
had
held
out
amazingly
well
the
wages
had
been
rather
higher
than
we
meant
but
the
men
had
no
chances
at
liquor
or
dissipation
and
had
worked
faster
than
we
expected
and
with
our
new
machines
we
made
brick
inconceivably
fast
while
their
quality
was
so
good
that
dear
george
said
there
was
never
so
little
waste
we
celebrated
thanksgiving
of
that
year
together
my
family
and
his
family
we
had
paid
off
all
the
laborers
and
there
were
left
of
that
busy
village
only
asaph
langdon
and
his
family
levi
jordan
and
levi
ross
horace
leonard
and
seth
whitman
with
theirs
theirs
i
say
but
ross
had
no
family
he
was
a
nice
young
fellow
who
was
there
as
representative
to
take
care
of
the
accounts
and
the
roll
jordan
was
the
head
of
the
leonard
of
the
carpenters
and
whitman
of
the
commissariat
and
a
good
commissary
whitman
was
we
celebrated
thanksgiving
together
ah
me
what
a
cheerful
pleasant
time
we
had
how
happy
the
children
were
together
polly
and
i
and
our
bairns
were
to
go
to
boston
the
next
day
i
was
to
spend
the
winter
in
one
final
effort
to
get
thousand
dollars
more
if
i
could
with
which
we
might
paint
the
moon
or
put
on
some
ground
felspathic
granite
dust
in
a
sort
of
paste
which
in
its
hot
flight
through
the
air
might
fuse
into
a
white
enamel
all
of
us
who
saw
the
moon
were
so
delighted
with
its
success
that
we
felt
sure
the
friends
would
not
pause
about
this
trifle
the
rest
of
them
were
to
stay
there
to
watch
the
winter
and
to
be
ready
to
begin
work
the
moment
the
snow
had
gone
thanksgiving
afternoon
how
well
i
remember
it
that
good
fellow
whitman
came
and
asked
polly
and
me
to
visit
his
family
in
their
new
quarters
they
had
moved
for
the
winter
into
cells
b
and
e
so
lofty
spacious
and
warm
and
so
much
drier
than
their
log
cabins
whitman
i
remember
was
very
cheerful
and
jolly
made
my
children
eat
another
piece
of
pie
and
stuffed
their
pockets
with
raisins
and
then
with
great
ceremony
and
fun
we
christened
room
b
by
the
name
of
bertha
and
e
ellen
which
was
whitman
name
and
the
next
day
we
bade
them
all
little
thinking
what
we
said
and
with
endless
promises
of
what
we
would
send
and
bring
them
in
the
spring
here
are
the
scraps
of
letters
from
orcutt
dear
fellow
which
tell
what
more
there
is
left
to
tell
december
after
you
left
we
were
a
little
blue
and
hung
round
loose
for
a
day
or
two
sunday
we
missed
you
especially
but
asaph
made
a
good
substitute
and
leonard
led
the
singing
the
next
day
we
moved
the
leonards
into
l
and
m
which
we
christened
leonard
and
mary
mary
is
for
your
wife
they
are
pretty
dark
but
very
dry
leonard
has
swung
hammocks
as
whitman
did
asaph
came
to
me
tuesday
and
said
he
thought
they
had
better
turn
to
and
put
a
shed
over
the
unfinished
circle
and
so
take
occasion
of
warm
days
for
dry
work
there
this
we
have
done
and
the
occupation
is
good
for
us
december
i
have
had
no
chance
to
write
for
a
fortnight
the
truth
is
that
the
weather
has
been
so
open
that
i
let
asaph
go
down
to
no
and
to
wilder
and
engage
of
the
best
of
the
men
who
we
knew
were
hanging
round
there
we
have
all
been
at
work
most
of
the
time
since
with
very
good
success
h
is
now
wholly
covered
in
and
the
centring
is
out
the
men
have
named
it
haliburton
i
is
well
advanced
j
is
as
you
left
it
the
work
has
been
good
for
us
all
morally
february
we
got
your
mail
unexpectedly
by
some
lumbermen
on
their
way
to
the
range
one
of
them
has
cut
himself
and
takes
this
down
you
will
be
amazed
to
hear
that
i
and
k
are
both
done
we
have
had
splendid
weather
and
have
worked
half
the
time
we
had
a
great
jollification
when
k
was
closed
in
called
it
kilpatrick
for
seth
old
general
i
wish
you
could
just
run
up
and
see
us
you
must
be
quick
if
you
want
to
put
in
any
of
the
last
licks
march
dear
fred
i
have
but
an
instant
by
all
means
make
your
preparations
to
be
here
by
the
end
of
the
month
or
early
in
next
month
the
weather
has
been
faultless
you
know
asaph
got
in
a
dozen
more
men
and
we
have
brought
up
the
surface
farther
than
you
could
dream
the
ways
are
well
forward
and
i
can
not
see
why
if
the
freshet
hold
off
a
little
we
should
not
launch
her
by
the
or
i
do
not
think
it
worth
while
to
wait
for
paint
or
enamel
telegraph
brannan
that
he
must
be
here
you
will
be
amused
by
our
quarters
we
who
were
the
last
outsiders
move
into
a
and
d
for
a
few
weeks
it
is
much
warmer
there
ever
yours
g
o
i
telegraphed
brannan
and
in
reply
he
came
with
his
wife
and
his
children
to
boston
i
told
him
that
he
could
not
possibly
get
up
there
as
the
roads
then
were
but
ben
said
he
would
go
to
skowhegan
and
take
his
chance
there
he
would
of
course
communicate
with
me
as
soon
as
he
got
there
accordingly
i
got
a
note
from
him
at
skowhegan
saying
he
had
hired
a
sleigh
to
go
over
to
no
and
in
four
days
more
i
got
this
letter
march
dear
fred
i
am
most
glad
i
came
and
i
beg
you
to
bring
your
wife
as
soon
as
possible
the
river
is
very
full
the
wheels
to
which
leonard
has
added
two
auxiliaries
are
moving
as
if
they
could
not
hold
out
long
the
ways
are
all
but
ready
and
we
think
we
must
not
wait
start
with
all
hands
as
soon
as
you
can
i
had
no
difficulty
in
coming
over
from
skowhegan
we
did
it
in
two
days
this
note
i
sent
at
once
to
haliburton
and
we
got
all
the
children
ready
for
a
winter
journey
as
the
spectacle
of
the
launch
of
the
moon
was
one
to
be
remembered
their
life
long
but
it
was
clearly
impossible
to
attempt
at
that
season
to
get
the
subscribers
together
just
as
we
started
this
despatch
from
skowhegan
was
brought
me
the
last
word
i
got
from
them
stop
for
nothing
there
is
a
jam
below
us
in
the
stream
and
we
fear
orcutt
of
course
we
could
not
go
faster
than
we
could
we
missed
no
connection
at
skowhegan
haliburton
and
i
took
a
cutter
leaving
the
ladies
and
children
to
follow
at
once
in
larger
sleighs
we
drove
all
night
changed
horses
at
prospect
and
kept
on
all
the
next
day
at
no
we
had
to
wait
over
night
we
started
early
in
the
morning
and
came
down
the
spoonwood
hill
at
four
in
the
afternoon
in
full
sight
of
our
little
village
it
was
quiet
as
the
grave
not
a
smoke
not
a
man
not
an
nor
the
tick
of
a
trowel
only
the
gigantic
were
whirling
as
i
saw
them
last
there
was
the
lower
centring
somewhat
as
i
first
saw
it
but
where
was
the
brick
dome
of
the
moon
good
heavens
has
it
fallen
on
them
all
cried
haliburton
lashed
the
beast
till
he
fairly
ran
down
that
steep
hill
we
turned
a
little
point
and
came
out
in
front
of
the
centring
there
was
no
moon
there
an
empty
amphitheatre
with
not
a
brick
nor
a
splinter
within
we
were
speechless
we
left
the
cutter
we
ran
up
the
stairways
to
the
terrace
we
ran
by
the
familiar
paths
into
the
centring
we
came
out
upon
the
ways
which
we
had
never
seen
before
these
told
the
story
too
well
the
ground
and
crushed
surface
of
the
timbers
scorched
by
the
rapidity
with
which
the
moon
had
slid
down
told
that
they
had
done
the
duty
for
which
they
were
built
it
was
too
clear
that
in
some
wild
rush
of
the
waters
the
ground
had
yielded
a
trifle
we
could
not
find
that
the
foundations
had
sunk
more
than
six
inches
but
that
was
enough
in
that
fatal
six
inches
decline
of
the
centring
the
moon
had
been
launched
upon
the
ways
just
as
george
had
intended
that
it
should
be
when
he
was
ready
but
it
had
slid
not
rolled
down
upon
these
angry
and
in
an
instant
with
all
our
friends
it
had
been
hurled
into
the
sky
they
have
gone
up
said
haliburton
she
has
gone
up
said
i
both
in
one
breath
and
with
a
common
instinct
we
looked
up
into
the
blue
but
of
course
she
was
not
there
not
a
shred
of
letter
or
any
other
tidings
could
we
find
in
any
of
the
shanties
it
was
indeed
six
weeks
since
george
and
fanny
and
their
children
had
moved
into
annie
and
diamond
two
unoccupied
cells
of
the
moon
so
much
more
comfortable
had
the
cells
proved
than
the
cabins
for
winter
life
returning
to
no
we
found
there
many
of
the
laborers
who
were
astonished
at
what
we
told
them
they
had
been
paid
off
on
the
and
told
to
come
up
again
on
the
of
april
to
see
the
launch
one
of
them
a
man
named
rob
shea
told
me
that
george
kept
his
cousin
peter
to
help
him
move
back
into
his
house
the
beginning
of
the
next
week
and
that
was
the
last
i
knew
of
any
of
them
for
more
than
a
year
at
first
i
expected
each
hour
to
hear
that
they
had
fallen
somewhere
but
time
passed
by
and
of
such
a
fall
where
man
knows
the
world
surface
there
was
no
tale
i
answered
as
best
i
could
the
letters
of
their
friends
by
saying
i
did
not
know
where
they
were
and
had
not
heard
from
them
my
real
thought
was
that
if
this
fatal
moon
did
indeed
pass
our
atmosphere
all
in
it
must
have
been
burned
to
death
in
the
transit
but
this
i
whispered
to
no
one
save
to
polly
and
annie
and
haliburton
in
this
terrible
doubt
i
remained
till
i
noticed
one
day
in
the
astronomical
record
the
memorandum
which
you
perhaps
remember
of
the
observation
by
zitta
of
a
new
asteroid
with
an
enormous
movement
in
declination
iii
fulfilment
looking
back
upon
it
now
it
seems
inconceivable
that
we
said
as
little
to
each
other
as
we
did
of
this
horrible
catastrophe
that
night
we
did
not
pretend
to
sleep
we
sat
in
one
of
the
deserted
cabins
now
talking
fast
now
sitting
and
brooding
without
speaking
perhaps
for
hours
riding
back
the
next
day
to
meet
the
women
and
children
we
still
brooded
or
we
discussed
this
if
that
if
and
yet
others
but
after
we
had
once
opened
it
all
to
them
and
when
we
had
once
answered
the
children
horribly
naive
questions
as
best
we
could
we
very
seldom
spoke
to
each
other
of
it
again
it
was
too
hateful
all
of
it
to
talk
about
i
went
round
to
tom
coram
office
one
day
and
told
him
all
i
knew
he
saw
it
was
dreadful
to
me
and
with
his
eyes
full
just
squeezed
my
hand
and
never
said
one
word
more
we
lay
awake
nights
pondering
and
wondering
but
hardly
ever
did
i
to
haliburton
or
he
to
me
explain
our
respective
notions
as
they
came
and
went
i
believe
my
general
impression
was
that
of
which
i
have
spoken
that
they
were
all
burned
to
death
on
the
instant
as
the
little
aerolite
fused
in
its
passage
through
our
atmosphere
i
believe
haliburton
thought
more
often
was
that
they
were
conscious
of
what
had
happened
and
gasped
out
their
lives
in
one
or
two
breathless
minutes
so
horribly
long
as
they
shot
outside
of
our
atmosphere
but
it
was
all
too
terrible
for
words
and
that
which
we
could
not
but
think
upon
in
those
dreadful
waking
nights
we
scarcely
whispered
even
to
our
wives
of
course
i
looked
and
he
looked
for
the
miserable
thing
but
we
looked
in
vain
i
returned
to
the
few
subscribers
the
money
which
i
had
scraped
together
towards
whitewashing
the
moon
shrouding
its
guilty
face
with
innocent
white
indeed
but
we
agreed
to
spend
the
wretched
trifle
of
the
other
money
left
in
the
treasury
after
paying
the
last
bills
for
the
largest
alvan
clark
telescope
that
we
could
buy
and
we
were
fortunate
in
obtaining
cheap
a
one
which
came
to
the
hammer
when
the
property
of
the
shubael
academy
was
sold
by
the
mortgagees
but
we
had
of
course
scarce
a
hint
whatever
as
to
where
the
miserable
object
was
to
be
found
all
we
could
do
was
to
carry
the
glass
to
no
to
train
it
there
on
the
meridian
of
no
and
take
turns
every
night
in
watching
the
field
in
the
hope
that
this
child
of
sorrow
might
drift
across
it
in
its
path
of
ruin
but
though
everything
else
seemed
to
drift
by
from
east
to
west
nothing
came
from
south
to
north
as
we
expected
for
a
whole
month
of
spring
another
of
autumn
another
of
summer
and
another
of
winter
did
haliburton
and
his
wife
and
polly
and
i
glue
our
eyes
to
that
from
the
twilight
of
evening
to
the
twilight
of
morning
and
the
dead
hulk
never
hove
in
sight
wherever
else
it
was
it
seemed
not
to
be
on
that
meridian
which
was
where
it
ought
to
be
and
was
made
to
be
had
ever
any
dead
mass
of
matter
wrought
such
ruin
to
its
makers
and
of
its
own
stupid
inertia
so
falsified
all
the
prophecies
of
its
birth
oh
the
total
depravity
of
things
it
was
more
than
a
year
after
the
fatal
night
if
it
all
happened
in
the
night
as
i
suppose
that
as
i
dreamily
read
through
the
astronomical
record
in
the
new
of
the
college
library
at
cambridge
i
lighted
on
this
scrap
professor
karl
zitta
of
breslau
writes
to
the
astronomische
nachrichten
to
claim
the
discovery
of
a
new
asteroid
observed
by
him
on
the
night
of
march
app
app
decl
bresl
size
march
april
he
proposes
for
the
asteroid
the
name
of
phoebe
zitta
states
that
in
the
short
period
which
he
had
for
observing
phoebe
for
an
hour
after
midnight
her
motion
in
seemed
slight
and
her
motion
in
declination
very
rapid
after
this
however
for
months
nay
even
to
this
moment
nothing
more
was
heard
of
zitta
of
breslau
but
one
morning
before
i
was
up
haliburton
came
banging
at
my
door
on
d
street
the
mood
had
taken
him
as
he
returned
from
some
private
theatricals
at
cambridge
to
take
the
comfort
of
the
new
at
night
and
thus
express
in
practice
his
gratitude
to
the
overseers
of
the
college
for
keeping
it
open
through
all
the
hours
poor
haliburton
he
did
not
sleep
well
in
those
times
well
as
he
read
away
on
the
astronomische
nachrichten
itself
what
should
he
find
but
this
in
german
which
he
copied
for
me
and
then
all
on
foot
in
the
rain
and
darkness
tramped
over
with
to
south
boston
the
most
enlightened
head
professor
gmelin
writes
to
the
director
of
the
porpol
astronomik
at
petersburg
to
claim
the
discovery
of
an
asteroid
in
a
very
high
southern
latitude
of
a
wider
inclination
of
the
orbit
as
will
be
noticed
than
any
asteroid
yet
observed
planet
apparent
alpha
planet
apparent
delta
comparison
star
alpha
gmelin
publishes
no
separate
second
observation
but
is
confident
that
the
declination
is
diminishing
gmelin
suggests
for
the
name
of
this
planet
as
appropriate
to
its
wanderings
from
the
accustomed
ways
of
planetary
life
and
trusts
that
the
very
distinguished
herr
peters
the
godfather
of
so
many
planets
will
relinquish
this
name
already
claimed
for
the
asteroid
observed
by
him
september
i
had
run
down
stairs
almost
as
i
was
slippers
and
being
the
only
claims
i
had
on
society
but
to
me
as
to
haliburton
this
stuff
about
zodiacal
wandering
blazed
out
upon
the
page
and
though
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
most
enlightened
gmelin
found
anything
the
next
night
yet
if
his
diminishing
meant
anything
there
was
with
zitta
observation
whoever
zitta
might
be
something
to
start
upon
we
rushed
upon
some
old
bound
volumes
of
the
record
and
spotted
the
enlightened
gmelin
he
was
chief
of
a
college
at
taganrog
where
perhaps
they
had
a
spyglass
this
gave
us
the
parallax
of
his
observation
breslau
of
course
we
knew
and
so
we
could
place
zitta
and
with
these
poor
data
i
went
to
work
to
construct
if
i
could
an
orbit
for
this
mass
of
brick
and
mortar
haliburton
not
strong
in
spherical
trigonometry
looked
out
logarithms
for
me
till
breakfast
and
as
soon
as
it
would
do
went
over
to
bowdoin
to
borrow
her
telescope
ours
being
left
at
no
bowdoin
was
kind
as
she
always
was
and
at
noon
haliburton
appeared
in
triumph
with
the
boxes
on
nolan
we
always
employ
in
memory
of
dear
old
phil
we
got
the
telescope
rigged
and
waited
for
night
only
alas
to
be
disappointed
again
io
had
wandered
somewhere
else
and
with
all
our
sweeping
back
and
forth
on
the
tentative
curve
i
had
laid
out
io
would
not
appear
we
spent
that
night
in
vain
but
we
were
not
going
to
give
it
up
so
phoebe
might
have
gone
round
the
world
twice
before
she
became
io
might
have
gone
three
times
four
five
six
nay
six
hundred
who
knew
nay
who
knew
how
far
off
io
was
or
we
sent
over
for
annie
and
she
and
polly
and
george
and
i
went
to
work
again
we
calculated
in
the
next
week
orbits
on
the
supposition
of
so
many
different
distances
from
our
surface
i
laid
out
on
a
paper
which
we
stuck
up
on
the
wall
opposite
the
formula
and
then
one
woman
and
one
man
attacked
each
set
of
elements
each
having
the
logarithmic
tables
and
so
in
a
week
the
orbits
were
completed
possible
places
for
to
be
in
on
the
forthcoming
friday
evening
of
these
one
were
observable
above
our
horizon
that
night
she
was
not
in
one
of
the
nor
near
it
but
despair
if
giotto
be
correct
is
the
chief
of
sins
so
has
he
depicted
her
in
the
fresco
of
the
arena
in
padua
no
sin
that
of
ours
after
searching
all
that
friday
night
we
slept
all
saturday
sleeping
after
sweeping
we
all
came
to
the
chapel
sunday
kept
awake
there
and
taught
our
sunday
classes
special
lessons
on
perseverance
on
monday
we
began
again
and
that
week
we
calculated
more
orbits
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
why
we
stopped
at
all
of
these
were
on
the
supposition
that
the
revolution
of
the
brick
moon
or
was
so
fast
that
it
would
require
either
fifteen
days
to
complete
its
orbit
or
sixteen
days
or
seventeen
days
and
so
on
up
to
days
and
with
these
orbits
on
the
next
friday
we
waited
for
the
darkness
as
we
sat
at
tea
i
asked
if
i
should
begin
observing
at
the
smallest
or
at
the
largest
orbit
and
there
was
a
great
clamor
of
diverse
opinions
but
little
bertha
said
begin
in
the
middle
and
what
is
the
middle
said
george
chaffing
the
little
girl
but
she
was
not
to
be
dismayed
she
had
been
in
and
out
all
the
week
and
knew
that
the
first
orbit
was
of
fifteen
days
and
the
last
of
and
with
true
lincoln
school
precision
she
said
the
mean
of
the
smallest
orbit
and
the
largest
orbit
is
days
amen
said
i
as
we
all
laughed
on
days
we
will
begin
alice
ran
to
the
sheets
turned
up
that
number
and
read
a
south
declination
convenient
place
said
george
good
omen
bertha
my
darling
if
we
find
her
there
alice
and
bertha
and
clara
shall
all
have
new
dolls
it
was
the
first
word
of
pleasantry
that
had
been
spoken
about
the
horrid
thing
since
spoonwood
hill
night
came
at
last
we
trained
the
glass
on
the
fated
spot
i
bade
polly
take
the
she
did
so
shook
her
head
uneasily
screwed
the
tube
northward
herself
a
moment
and
then
screamed
it
is
there
it
is
there
a
clear
disk
gibbous
shape
and
very
sharp
on
the
upper
edge
look
look
as
big
again
as
jupiter
polly
was
right
the
brick
moon
was
found
now
we
had
found
it
we
never
lost
it
zitta
and
gmelin
i
suppose
had
had
foggy
nights
and
stormy
weather
often
but
we
had
some
one
at
the
all
that
night
and
before
morning
had
very
respectable
elements
good
measurements
of
angular
distance
when
we
got
one
from
another
star
in
the
field
of
our
lowest
power
for
we
could
see
her
even
with
a
good
french
i
had
and
with
a
which
i
used
to
carry
on
the
south
atlantic
station
it
certainly
was
an
extraordinary
illustration
of
orcutt
engineering
ability
that
flying
off
as
she
did
without
leave
or
license
she
should
have
gained
so
nearly
the
orbit
of
our
original
plan
nine
thousand
miles
from
the
centre
five
thousand
from
the
surface
he
had
always
stuck
to
the
hope
of
this
and
on
his
very
last
tests
of
the
flies
he
had
said
they
were
almost
up
to
it
but
for
this
accuracy
of
his
i
can
hardly
suppose
we
should
have
found
her
to
this
hour
since
she
had
failed
by
what
cause
i
then
did
not
know
to
take
her
intended
place
on
the
meridian
of
no
at
five
thousand
miles
the
moon
appeared
as
large
as
the
largest
satellite
of
jupiter
appears
and
polly
was
right
in
that
first
observation
when
she
said
she
got
a
good
disk
with
that
admirable
glass
of
bowdoin
the
orbit
was
not
on
the
meridian
of
no
nor
did
it
remain
on
any
meridian
but
it
was
very
nearly
south
and
north
an
enormous
motion
in
declination
with
a
very
slight
retrograde
motion
in
right
ascension
at
five
thousand
miles
the
moon
showed
as
large
as
a
circle
two
miles
and
a
third
in
diameter
would
have
shown
on
old
thornbush
as
we
always
called
her
older
sister
we
longed
for
an
eclipse
of
thornbush
by
but
no
such
lucky
chance
is
on
the
cards
in
any
place
accessible
to
us
for
many
years
of
course
with
a
moon
so
near
us
the
terrestrial
parallax
is
enormous
now
you
know
dear
reader
that
the
gigantic
reflector
of
lord
rosse
and
the
exquisite
inch
refractors
of
the
modern
observatories
eliminate
from
the
chaotic
of
the
surface
of
old
thornbush
much
smaller
objects
than
such
a
circle
as
i
have
named
if
you
have
read
locke
amusing
moon
hoax
as
often
as
i
have
you
have
those
details
fresh
in
your
memory
as
john
farrar
taught
us
when
all
this
began
and
as
i
have
said
already
if
there
were
a
state
house
in
thornbush
two
hundred
feet
long
the
first
herschel
would
have
seen
it
his
magnifying
power
was
that
would
have
brought
this
deaf
and
dumb
state
house
within
some
forty
miles
go
up
on
mt
washington
and
see
white
sails
eighty
miles
away
beyond
portland
with
your
naked
eye
and
you
will
find
how
well
he
would
have
seen
that
state
house
with
his
reflector
lord
rosse
statement
is
that
with
his
reflector
he
can
see
objects
on
old
thornbush
two
hundred
and
feet
long
if
he
can
do
that
he
can
see
on
our
objects
which
are
five
feet
long
and
of
course
we
were
beside
ourselves
to
get
control
of
some
instrument
which
had
some
approach
to
such
power
haliburton
was
for
at
once
building
a
reflector
at
no
and
perhaps
he
will
do
it
yet
for
haliburton
has
been
successful
in
his
making
and
lumbering
but
i
went
to
work
more
promptly
i
remembered
not
an
apothecary
but
an
observatory
which
had
been
dormant
as
we
say
of
volcanoes
now
for
ten
or
a
dozen
years
no
matter
why
the
trustees
had
quarrelled
with
the
director
or
the
funds
had
given
out
or
the
director
had
been
shot
at
the
head
of
his
division
one
of
those
accidents
had
happened
which
will
happen
even
in
observatories
which
have
equatorials
and
so
the
equatorial
here
had
been
left
as
useless
as
a
cannon
whose
metal
has
been
strained
or
its
reputation
stained
in
an
experiment
the
observatory
at
tamworth
dedicated
with
such
enthusiasm
another
in
the
skies
had
been
so
long
as
i
have
said
worthless
to
the
world
to
tamworth
therefore
i
travelled
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
observatory
i
took
lodgings
to
the
church
where
worshipped
the
family
which
lived
in
the
observatory
buildings
i
repaired
after
two
sundays
i
established
acquaintance
with
john
donald
the
head
of
this
family
on
the
evening
of
the
third
i
made
acquaintance
with
his
wife
in
a
visit
to
them
before
three
sundays
more
he
had
recommended
me
to
the
surviving
trustees
as
his
successor
as
janitor
to
the
buildings
he
himself
had
accepted
promotion
and
gone
with
his
household
to
keep
a
store
for
haliburton
in
north
ovid
i
sent
for
polly
and
the
children
to
establish
them
in
the
janitor
rooms
and
after
writing
to
her
with
trembling
eye
i
waited
for
the
brick
moon
to
pass
over
the
field
of
the
equatorial
night
came
i
was
sole
alone
came
more
than
filled
the
field
of
vision
of
course
but
for
that
i
was
ready
heavens
how
changed
red
no
longer
but
green
as
a
meadow
in
the
spring
still
i
could
see
black
on
the
green
the
large
circles
which
i
remembered
so
well
which
broke
the
concave
of
the
dome
and
on
the
upper
edge
were
these
they
were
no
they
were
hemlocks
by
their
shape
and
among
them
were
moving
to
and
fro
flies
of
course
i
can
not
see
flies
but
something
is
moving
coming
going
one
two
three
ten
there
are
more
than
thirty
in
all
they
are
men
and
women
and
their
children
could
it
be
possible
it
was
possible
orcutt
and
brannan
and
the
rest
of
them
had
survived
that
giddy
flight
through
the
ether
and
were
going
and
coming
on
the
surface
of
their
own
little
world
bound
to
it
by
its
own
attraction
and
living
by
its
own
laws
as
i
watched
i
saw
one
of
them
leap
from
that
surface
he
passed
wholly
out
of
my
field
of
vision
but
in
a
minute
more
or
less
returned
why
not
of
course
the
attraction
of
his
world
must
be
very
small
while
he
retained
the
same
power
of
muscle
he
had
when
he
was
here
they
must
be
horribly
crowded
i
thought
no
they
had
three
acres
of
surface
and
there
were
but
of
them
not
so
much
crowded
as
people
are
in
roxbury
not
nearly
so
much
as
in
boston
and
besides
these
people
are
living
underground
and
have
the
whole
of
their
surface
for
their
exercise
i
watched
their
every
movement
as
they
approached
the
edge
and
as
they
left
it
often
they
passed
beyond
it
so
that
i
could
see
them
no
more
often
they
sheltered
themselves
from
that
tropical
sun
beneath
the
trees
think
of
living
on
a
world
where
from
the
vertical
heat
of
the
hottest
noon
of
the
equator
to
the
twilight
of
the
poles
is
a
walk
of
only
fifty
paces
what
atmosphere
they
had
to
temper
and
diffuse
those
rays
i
could
not
then
conjecture
i
knew
that
at
ten
they
would
pass
into
the
inevitable
eclipse
which
struck
them
every
night
at
this
period
of
their
orbit
and
must
i
thought
be
a
luxury
to
them
as
recalling
old
memories
of
night
when
they
were
on
this
world
as
they
approached
the
line
of
shadow
some
fifteen
minutes
before
it
was
due
i
counted
on
the
edge
specks
arranged
evidently
in
order
and
at
one
moment
as
by
one
signal
all
seven
jumped
into
the
air
high
jumps
again
they
did
it
and
again
then
a
low
jump
then
a
high
one
i
caught
the
idea
in
a
moment
they
were
telegraphing
to
our
world
in
the
hope
of
an
observer
long
leaps
and
short
leaps
the
long
and
short
of
morse
telegraph
alphabet
were
communicating
ideas
my
paper
and
pencil
had
been
of
course
before
me
i
jotted
down
the
despatch
whose
language
i
knew
perfectly
show
understand
on
the
flat
show
understand
on
the
flat
show
understand
on
the
flat
by
i
understand
they
meant
the
responsive
signal
given
in
all
telegraphy
by
an
operator
who
has
received
and
understood
a
message
as
soon
as
this
exercise
had
been
three
times
repeated
they
proceeded
in
a
solid
body
much
the
most
apparent
object
i
had
had
until
now
to
circle
no
and
then
evidently
descended
into
the
moon
the
eclipse
soon
began
but
i
knew
the
moon
path
now
and
followed
the
dusky
coppery
spot
without
difficulty
at
it
emerged
and
in
a
very
few
moments
i
saw
the
solid
column
pass
from
circle
no
again
deploy
on
the
edge
again
and
repeat
three
times
the
signal
show
understand
on
the
flat
show
understand
on
the
flat
show
understand
on
the
flat
it
was
clear
that
orcutt
had
known
that
the
edge
of
his
little
world
would
be
most
easy
of
observation
and
that
he
had
guessed
that
the
moments
of
obscuration
and
of
emersion
were
the
moments
when
observers
would
be
most
careful
after
this
signal
they
broke
up
again
and
i
could
not
follow
them
with
daylight
i
sent
off
a
despatch
to
haliburton
and
grateful
and
happy
in
comparison
sank
into
the
first
sleep
not
haunted
by
horrid
dreams
which
i
had
known
for
years
haliburton
knew
that
george
orcutt
had
taken
with
him
a
good
dolland
refractor
which
he
had
bought
in
london
of
a
glass
he
knew
that
this
would
give
orcutt
a
very
considerable
power
if
he
could
only
adjust
it
accurately
enough
to
find
no
in
the
range
orcutt
had
chosen
well
in
selecting
the
flat
a
large
meadow
easily
distinguished
by
the
peculiar
shape
of
the
which
we
had
made
eager
though
haliburton
was
to
join
me
he
loyally
took
moneys
caught
the
first
train
to
skowhegan
and
travelling
thence
in
hours
more
was
again
descending
spoonwood
hill
for
the
first
time
since
our
futile
observations
the
snow
lay
white
upon
the
flat
with
rob
shea
help
he
rapidly
unrolled
a
piece
of
black
cambric
twenty
yards
long
and
pinned
it
to
the
crust
upon
the
snow
another
by
its
side
and
another
much
cambric
had
he
left
they
had
carried
down
with
them
enough
for
the
funerals
of
two
presidents
haliburton
showed
the
symbols
for
i
understand
but
he
could
not
resist
also
displaying
which
are
the
dots
and
lines
to
represent
which
he
says
is
the
shortest
message
of
comfort
and
not
having
exhausted
the
space
on
the
flat
he
and
robert
before
night
closed
in
made
a
gigantic
fifteen
yards
from
top
to
bottom
and
in
marks
that
were
fifteen
feet
through
i
had
telegraphed
my
great
news
to
haliburton
on
monday
night
tuesday
night
he
was
at
skowhegan
thursday
night
he
was
at
no
friday
he
and
rob
stretched
their
cambric
meanwhile
every
day
i
slept
every
night
i
was
glued
to
the
fifteen
minutes
before
the
eclipse
every
night
this
weird
dance
of
leaps
two
hundred
feet
high
followed
by
hops
of
twenty
feet
high
mingled
always
in
the
steady
order
i
have
described
spelt
out
the
ghastly
message
show
understand
on
the
flat
and
every
morning
as
the
eclipse
ended
i
saw
the
column
creep
along
to
the
horizon
and
again
as
the
duty
of
opening
day
spell
out
the
same
show
understand
on
the
flat
they
had
done
this
twice
in
every
hours
for
nearly
two
years
for
three
nights
steadily
i
read
these
signals
twice
each
night
only
these
and
nothing
more
but
friday
night
all
was
changed
after
attention
that
dreadful
show
did
not
come
but
this
cheerful
signal
hurrah
all
well
air
food
and
friends
what
more
can
man
require
hurrah
how
like
george
how
like
ben
brannan
how
like
george
wife
how
like
them
all
and
they
were
all
well
yet
poor
could
not
answer
nay
i
could
only
guess
what
haliburton
had
done
but
i
have
never
i
believe
been
so
grateful
since
i
was
born
after
a
pause
the
united
line
of
leapers
resumed
their
jumps
and
hops
long
and
short
spelled
out
your
is
twice
as
large
as
it
need
be
of
the
meaning
of
this
lonely
had
of
course
no
idea
i
have
a
power
of
seven
hundred
continued
george
how
did
he
get
that
he
has
never
told
us
but
this
i
can
see
that
all
our
analogies
deceive
us
of
views
of
the
sea
from
mt
washington
or
of
the
boston
state
house
from
wachusett
for
in
these
views
we
look
through
forty
or
eighty
miles
of
dense
terrestrial
atmosphere
but
orcutt
was
looking
nearly
vertically
through
an
atmosphere
which
was
most
of
it
rare
indeed
and
pure
indeed
compared
with
its
lowest
stratum
in
the
of
my
observations
these
despatches
are
entered
as
and
of
course
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
reply
all
i
could
do
was
to
telegraph
these
in
the
morning
to
skowhegan
sending
them
to
the
care
of
the
moores
that
they
might
forward
them
but
the
next
night
showed
that
this
had
not
been
necessary
friday
night
george
and
the
others
went
on
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
they
would
rest
saying
two
three
or
whatever
their
next
signal
time
would
be
before
morning
i
had
these
despatches
write
to
all
hands
that
we
are
doing
well
langdon
baby
is
named
io
and
leonard
is
named
phoebe
how
queer
that
was
what
a
coincidence
and
they
had
some
humor
there
was
our
atmosphere
stuck
to
us
it
weighs
three
tenths
of
an
inch
our
weight
our
is
regular
as
the
clock
we
have
made
a
cistern
of
kilpatrick
this
meant
the
spherical
chamber
of
that
name
write
to
darwin
that
he
is
all
right
we
began
with
lichens
and
have
come
as
far
as
palms
and
hemlocks
these
were
the
first
night
messages
i
had
scarcely
covered
the
and
adjusted
the
equatorial
for
the
day
when
the
bell
announced
the
carriage
in
which
polly
and
the
children
came
from
the
station
to
relieve
me
in
my
solitary
service
as
janitor
i
had
the
joy
of
showing
her
the
good
news
this
work
seemed
to
fill
our
cup
for
all
the
day
before
when
i
was
awake
i
had
been
haunted
by
the
fear
of
famine
for
them
true
i
knew
that
they
had
stored
away
in
chambers
h
i
and
j
the
pork
and
flour
which
we
had
sent
up
for
the
workmen
through
the
summer
and
the
corn
and
oats
for
the
horses
but
this
could
not
last
forever
now
however
that
it
proved
that
in
a
tropical
climate
they
were
forming
their
own
soil
developing
their
own
palms
and
eventually
even
their
and
bananas
planting
their
own
oats
and
maize
and
developing
rice
wheat
and
all
other
cereals
harvesting
these
six
eight
or
ten
times
for
aught
i
could
see
in
one
of
our
years
why
then
there
was
no
danger
of
famine
for
them
if
as
i
thought
they
carried
up
with
them
heavy
drifts
of
ice
and
snow
in
the
two
chambers
which
were
not
covered
in
when
they
started
why
they
had
waters
in
their
firmament
quite
sufficient
for
all
purposes
of
thirst
and
of
ablution
and
what
i
had
seen
of
their
exercise
showed
that
they
were
in
strength
sufficient
for
the
proper
development
of
their
little
world
polly
had
the
messages
by
heart
before
an
hour
was
over
and
the
little
girls
of
course
knew
them
sooner
than
she
haliburton
meanwhile
had
brought
out
the
shubael
refractor
alvan
clark
and
by
night
of
friday
was
in
readiness
to
see
what
he
could
see
shubael
of
course
gave
him
no
such
luxury
of
detail
as
did
my
equatorial
but
still
he
had
no
difficulty
in
making
out
groves
of
hemlock
and
the
circular
openings
and
although
he
could
not
make
out
my
flies
still
when
came
he
saw
distinctly
the
black
square
crossing
from
hole
mary
to
the
edge
and
beginning
its
dervish
dances
they
were
on
his
edge
more
precisely
than
on
mine
for
orcutt
knew
nothing
of
tamworth
and
had
thought
his
best
chance
was
to
display
for
no
so
was
it
that
at
the
same
moment
with
me
haliburton
also
was
spelling
out
orcutt
joyous
hurrah
thtephen
lisps
celia
promith
that
you
will
look
at
yon
moon
old
thombush
at
the
inthtant
i
do
so
was
it
with
me
and
haliburton
he
was
of
course
informed
long
before
the
messenger
came
that
in
orcutt
judgment
twenty
feet
of
length
were
sufficient
for
his
signals
atmosphere
of
course
must
be
exquisitely
clear
so
on
saturday
rob
and
haliburton
pulled
up
all
their
cambric
and
arranged
it
on
the
flat
again
in
letters
of
twenty
feet
in
this
legend
rah
al
wel
haliburton
said
he
could
not
waste
flat
or
cambric
on
spelling
he
had
had
all
night
since
ten
to
consider
what
next
was
most
important
for
them
to
know
and
a
very
difficult
question
it
was
you
will
observe
they
had
been
gone
nearly
two
years
and
much
had
happened
which
thing
was
on
the
whole
the
most
interesting
and
important
he
had
said
we
were
all
well
what
then
did
you
never
find
yourself
in
the
same
difficulty
when
your
husband
had
come
home
from
sea
and
kissed
you
and
the
children
and
wondered
at
their
size
did
you
never
sit
silent
and
have
to
think
what
you
should
say
were
you
never
fairly
relieved
when
little
phil
said
blustering
i
got
three
eggs
the
truth
is
that
silence
is
very
satisfactory
intercourse
if
we
only
know
all
is
well
when
de
sauty
got
his
original
cable
going
he
had
not
much
to
tell
after
all
only
that
consols
were
a
quarter
per
cent
higher
than
they
were
the
day
before
send
me
news
lisped
he
poor
lonely
myth
from
bull
bay
to
valentia
send
me
news
they
are
mad
for
news
but
how
if
there
be
no
news
worth
sending
what
do
i
read
in
my
cable
despatch
only
that
the
harvard
crew
pulled
at
putney
yesterday
which
i
knew
before
i
opened
the
paper
and
that
there
had
been
a
riot
in
spain
which
i
also
knew
here
is
a
letter
just
brought
me
by
the
mail
from
moreau
tazewell
county
iowa
it
is
written
by
follansbee
in
a
good
cheerful
hand
how
glad
i
am
to
hear
from
follansbee
yes
but
do
i
care
one
straw
whether
follansbee
planted
spring
wheat
or
winter
wheat
not
i
all
i
care
for
is
follansbee
way
of
telling
it
all
these
are
the
remarks
by
which
haliburton
explains
the
character
of
the
messages
he
sent
in
reply
to
george
orcutt
autographs
which
were
so
thoroughly
satisfactory
should
he
say
borie
had
left
the
navy
department
and
robeson
come
in
should
he
say
the
lords
had
backed
down
on
the
disendowment
bill
should
he
say
the
telegraph
had
been
landed
at
duxbury
should
he
say
ingham
had
removed
to
tamworth
what
did
they
care
for
this
what
does
anybody
ever
care
for
facts
should
he
say
that
the
state
constable
was
enforcing
the
liquor
law
on
whiskey
but
was
winking
at
lager
all
this
would
take
him
a
week
in
the
most
severe
condensation
and
for
what
good
as
haliburton
asked
yet
these
were
the
things
that
the
newspapers
told
and
they
told
nothing
else
there
was
a
nice
little
poem
of
jean
ingelow
in
a
transcript
haliburton
had
with
him
he
said
he
was
really
tempted
to
spell
that
out
it
was
better
worth
it
than
all
the
rest
of
the
newspaper
stuff
and
would
be
remembered
a
thousand
years
after
that
was
forgotten
what
they
wanted
says
haliburton
was
sentiment
that
is
all
that
survives
and
is
eternal
so
he
and
rob
laid
out
their
cambric
thus
raw
al
wel
so
glad
haliburton
hesitated
whether
he
would
not
add
power
to
indicate
the
full
power
i
was
using
at
tamworth
but
he
determined
not
to
and
i
think
wisely
the
convenience
was
so
great
of
receiving
the
signal
at
the
spot
where
it
could
be
answered
that
for
the
present
he
thought
it
best
that
they
should
go
on
as
they
did
that
night
however
to
his
dismay
clouds
gathered
and
a
grim
began
he
got
no
observations
and
the
next
day
it
stormed
so
heavily
that
he
could
not
lay
his
signals
out
for
me
at
tamworth
i
had
a
heavy
storm
all
day
but
at
midnight
it
was
clear
and
as
soon
as
the
regular
eclipse
was
past
george
began
with
what
we
saw
was
an
account
of
the
great
anaclysm
which
sent
them
there
you
observe
that
orcutt
had
far
greater
power
of
communicating
with
us
than
we
had
with
him
he
knew
this
and
it
was
fortunate
he
had
for
he
had
on
his
little
world
much
more
of
interest
to
tell
than
we
had
on
our
large
one
it
stormed
hard
we
were
all
asleep
and
knew
nothing
till
morning
the
hammocks
turned
so
slowly
here
was
another
revelation
and
relief
i
had
always
supposed
that
if
they
knew
anything
before
they
were
roasted
to
death
they
had
had
one
wild
moment
of
horror
instead
of
this
the
gentle
slide
of
the
moon
had
not
wakened
them
the
flight
upward
had
been
as
easy
as
it
was
rapid
the
change
from
one
centre
of
gravity
to
another
had
of
course
been
slow
and
they
had
actually
slept
through
the
whole
after
the
dancers
had
rested
once
orcutt
continued
we
cleared
in
two
seconds
i
think
our
outer
surface
fused
and
cracked
somewhat
so
much
the
better
for
us
they
moved
so
fast
that
the
heat
of
their
friction
through
the
air
could
not
propagate
itself
through
the
whole
brick
surface
indeed
there
could
have
been
but
little
friction
after
the
first
five
or
ten
miles
by
he
means
earth
atmosphere
his
despatch
is
i
have
no
observations
of
ascent
but
by
theory
our
positive
ascent
ceased
in
two
minutes
five
seconds
when
we
fell
into
our
proper
orbit
which
as
i
calculate
is
miles
from
your
mean
surface
in
all
this
observe
george
dropped
no
word
of
regret
through
these
five
thousand
miles
his
despatch
is
our
rotation
on
our
axis
is
made
once
in
seven
hours
our
axis
being
exactly
vertical
to
the
plane
of
our
own
orbit
but
in
each
of
your
daily
rotations
we
get
sunned
all
round
of
course
they
never
had
lost
their
identity
with
us
so
far
as
our
rotation
and
revolution
went
our
inertia
was
theirs
all
the
fatal
had
given
them
was
an
additional
motion
in
space
of
their
own
this
was
the
last
despatch
before
daylight
of
sunday
morning
and
the
terrible
of
march
sweeping
our
hemisphere
cut
off
our
communication
with
them
both
at
tamworth
and
no
for
several
days
but
here
was
ample
food
for
reflection
our
friends
were
in
a
world
of
their
own
all
of
them
well
and
it
seemed
they
had
two
more
little
girls
added
to
their
number
since
they
started
they
had
plenty
of
vegetables
to
eat
with
prospect
of
new
tropical
varieties
according
to
darwin
rob
shea
was
sure
that
they
carried
up
hens
he
said
he
knew
whitman
had
several
middlesexes
and
leonard
two
or
three
black
spanish
fowls
which
had
been
given
her
by
some
friends
in
foxcroft
even
if
they
had
not
yet
had
time
enough
for
these
to
develop
into
alderneys
and
venison
they
would
not
be
without
animal
food
when
at
last
it
cleared
off
haliburton
had
to
telegraph
repeat
from
and
this
took
all
his
cambric
though
he
had
doubled
his
stock
orcutt
replied
the
next
night
i
can
see
your
storms
we
have
none
when
we
want
to
change
climate
we
can
walk
in
less
than
a
minute
from
midsummer
to
the
depth
of
winter
but
in
the
inside
we
have
eleven
different
temperatures
which
do
not
change
on
the
whole
there
is
a
certain
convenience
in
such
an
arrangement
with
no
he
went
back
to
his
story
it
took
us
many
days
one
or
two
of
our
months
to
adjust
ourselves
to
our
new
condition
our
greatest
grief
is
that
we
are
not
on
the
meridian
do
you
know
why
loyal
george
he
was
willing
to
exile
himself
and
his
race
from
the
most
of
mankind
if
only
the
great
purpose
of
his
life
could
be
fulfilled
but
his
great
regret
was
that
it
was
not
fulfilled
he
was
not
on
the
meridian
i
did
not
know
why
but
haliburton
with
infinite
labor
spelt
out
on
the
flat
cyc
project
ad
by
which
he
meant
see
article
projectiles
in
the
cyclopaedia
at
the
end
and
there
indeed
is
the
only
explanation
to
be
given
when
you
fire
a
shot
why
does
it
ever
go
to
the
right
or
left
of
the
plane
in
which
it
is
projected
hutton
ascribes
it
to
a
whirling
motion
acquired
by
the
bullet
by
friction
with
the
gun
euler
thinks
it
due
chiefly
to
the
irregularity
of
the
shape
of
the
ball
in
our
case
the
was
regular
enough
but
on
one
side
being
wholly
unprepared
for
flight
she
was
heavily
stored
with
pork
and
corn
while
her
other
chambers
had
in
some
of
them
heavy
drifts
of
snow
and
some
only
a
few
men
and
women
and
hens
before
orcutt
saw
haliburton
advice
he
had
sent
us
and
we
have
established
a
sandemanian
church
and
brannan
preaches
my
son
edward
and
alice
whitman
are
to
be
married
this
evening
this
despatch
unfortunately
did
not
reach
haliburton
though
i
got
it
so
all
the
happy
pair
received
for
our
was
the
advice
to
look
in
the
cyclopaedia
at
article
projectiles
near
the
end
was
we
shall
act
you
like
it
after
the
wedding
tickets
for
all
of
the
old
set
who
will
come
actually
in
one
week
reunion
we
had
come
to
joking
the
next
night
we
got
alice
says
she
will
not
read
the
cyclopaedia
in
the
honeymoon
but
is
much
obliged
to
haliburton
for
his
advice
how
did
she
ever
know
it
was
i
wrote
the
haliburton
to
me
alice
wants
to
know
if
haliburton
will
not
send
here
for
some
rags
says
we
have
plenty
with
little
need
for
clothes
and
then
despatches
began
to
be
more
serious
again
brannan
and
orcutt
had
failed
in
the
great
scheme
for
the
longitude
to
which
they
had
sacrificed
their
lives
if
indeed
it
were
a
sacrifice
to
retire
with
those
they
love
best
to
a
world
of
their
own
but
none
the
less
did
they
devote
themselves
with
the
rare
power
of
observation
they
had
to
the
benefit
of
our
world
thus
in
your
north
pole
is
an
open
ocean
it
was
black
which
we
think
means
water
from
august
to
september
your
south
pole
is
on
an
island
bigger
than
new
holland
your
antarctic
continent
is
a
great
cluster
of
islands
your
nyanzas
are
only
two
of
a
large
group
of
african
lakes
the
green
of
africa
where
there
is
no
water
is
wonderful
at
our
distance
we
have
not
the
last
numbers
of
play
tell
us
in
a
word
or
two
how
they
got
home
we
can
see
what
we
suppose
their
island
was
we
should
like
to
know
who
proved
right
in
knew
he
was
right
this
was
a
good
night
work
as
they
were
then
telegraphing
as
soon
as
it
cleared
haliburton
displayed
best
hopes
carrier
ducks
this
was
haliburton
masterpiece
he
had
no
room
for
more
however
and
was
obliged
to
reserve
for
the
next
day
his
answer
to
no
which
was
simply
she
a
real
equinoctial
now
parted
us
for
nearly
a
week
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
they
were
so
low
in
our
northern
horizon
that
we
could
not
make
out
their
signals
we
and
they
were
obliged
to
wait
till
they
had
passed
through
of
their
month
before
we
could
communicate
again
i
used
the
time
in
speeding
to
no
we
got
a
few
carpenters
together
and
arranged
on
the
flat
two
long
movable
black
platforms
which
ran
in
and
out
on
on
tracks
from
under
green
platforms
so
that
we
could
display
one
or
both
as
we
chose
and
then
withdraw
them
with
this
apparatus
we
could
give
signals
in
a
minute
corresponding
to
the
line
and
dot
of
the
telegraph
and
thus
could
compass
some
twenty
letters
in
that
time
and
make
out
perhaps
two
hundred
and
fifty
words
in
an
hour
haliburton
thought
that
with
some
improvements
he
could
send
one
of
buchanan
messages
up
in
iv
independence
i
own
to
a
certain
mortification
in
confessing
that
after
this
interregnum
forced
upon
us
by
so
long
a
period
of
we
never
resumed
precisely
the
same
constancy
of
communication
as
that
which
i
have
tried
to
describe
at
the
beginning
the
apology
for
this
benumbment
if
i
may
so
call
it
will
suggest
itself
to
the
thoughtful
reader
it
is
indeed
astonishing
to
think
that
we
so
readily
accept
a
position
when
we
once
understand
it
you
buy
a
new
house
you
are
fool
enough
to
take
out
a
staircase
that
you
may
put
in
a
this
will
be
done
in
a
fortnight
everybody
tells
you
and
then
everybody
begins
plumbers
masons
carpenters
plasterers
skimmers
men
men
who
make
men
who
scrape
off
the
old
paper
and
other
men
who
take
off
the
old
paint
with
alkali
gas
men
men
and
painters
begin
to
them
are
joined
a
considerable
number
of
assistants
assistants
assistants
and
hodmen
who
assist
the
assistants
of
the
masons
the
and
the
for
a
day
or
two
these
all
take
possession
of
the
house
and
reduce
it
to
chaos
in
the
language
of
scripture
they
enter
in
and
dwell
there
compare
for
the
details
matt
xii
then
you
revisit
it
at
the
end
of
the
fortnight
and
find
it
in
chaos
with
the
woman
whom
you
employed
to
wash
the
attics
the
only
person
on
the
scene
you
ask
her
where
the
is
and
she
says
he
can
do
nothing
because
the
plaster
is
not
dry
you
ask
why
the
plaster
is
not
dry
and
are
told
it
is
because
the
has
not
come
you
send
for
him
and
he
says
he
did
come
but
the
man
was
away
you
send
for
him
and
he
says
he
lost
a
day
in
coming
but
that
the
mason
had
not
cut
the
right
hole
in
the
chimney
you
go
and
find
the
mason
and
he
says
they
are
all
fools
and
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
house
that
need
take
two
days
to
finish
then
you
curse
not
the
day
in
which
you
were
born
but
the
day
in
which
were
invented
you
say
truly
that
your
father
and
mother
from
whom
you
inherit
every
moral
and
physical
faculty
you
prize
never
had
a
till
they
were
past
sixty
yet
they
thrived
and
their
children
you
sneak
through
back
streets
fearful
lest
your
friends
shall
ask
you
when
your
house
will
be
finished
you
are
sunk
in
wretchedness
unable
even
to
read
your
proofs
accurately
far
less
able
to
attend
the
primary
meetings
of
the
party
with
which
you
vote
or
to
discharge
any
of
the
duties
of
a
good
citizen
life
is
wholly
embittered
to
you
yet
six
weeks
after
you
sit
before
a
fire
in
your
new
house
with
the
feeling
that
you
have
always
lived
there
you
are
not
even
grateful
that
you
are
there
you
have
forgotten
the
plumber
name
and
if
you
met
in
the
street
that
nice
carpenter
that
drove
things
through
you
would
just
nod
to
him
and
would
not
think
of
kissing
him
or
embracing
him
thus
completely
have
you
accepted
the
situation
let
me
confess
that
the
same
experience
is
that
with
which
at
this
writing
i
regard
the
brick
moon
it
is
there
in
ether
i
can
not
keep
it
i
can
not
get
it
down
i
can
not
well
go
to
it
though
possibly
that
might
be
done
as
you
will
see
they
are
all
very
happy
there
much
happier
as
far
as
i
can
see
than
if
they
lived
in
sixth
floors
in
paris
in
lodgings
in
london
or
even
in
in
phoenix
place
boston
there
are
disadvantages
attached
to
their
position
but
there
are
also
advantages
and
what
most
of
all
tends
to
our
accepting
the
situation
is
that
there
is
nothing
that
we
can
do
about
it
as
says
but
to
keep
up
our
correspondence
with
them
and
to
express
our
sympathies
for
them
their
responsibilities
are
reduced
in
somewhat
the
same
proportion
as
the
gravitation
which
binds
them
down
i
had
almost
said
to
earth
which
binds
them
down
to
brick
i
mean
this
decrease
of
responsibility
must
make
them
as
as
the
loss
of
gravitation
makes
them
on
which
point
i
ask
for
a
moment
attention
and
as
these
sheets
leave
my
hand
an
illustration
turns
up
which
well
serves
me
it
is
the
of
october
yesterday
morning
all
wakeful
women
in
new
england
were
sure
there
was
some
one
under
the
bed
this
is
a
certain
sign
of
an
earthquake
and
when
we
read
the
evening
newspapers
we
were
made
sure
there
had
been
an
earthquake
what
blessings
the
newspapers
are
and
how
much
information
they
give
us
well
they
said
it
was
not
very
severe
here
but
perhaps
it
was
more
severe
elsewhere
hopes
really
arising
in
the
editorial
mind
that
in
some
caraccas
or
lisbon
all
churches
and
the
cathedral
might
have
fallen
i
did
not
hope
for
that
but
i
did
have
just
the
faintest
feeling
that
if
if
if
it
should
prove
that
the
world
had
blown
up
into
six
or
eight
pieces
and
they
had
gone
off
into
separate
orbits
life
would
be
vastly
easier
for
all
of
us
on
whichever
bit
we
happened
to
be
that
thing
has
happened
they
say
once
whenever
the
big
planet
between
mars
and
jupiter
blew
up
and
divided
himself
into
one
hundred
and
two
or
more
asteroids
the
people
on
each
one
only
knew
there
had
been
an
earthquake
when
and
after
they
read
their
morning
journals
and
then
all
that
they
knew
at
first
was
that
telegraphic
communication
had
ceased
beyond
say
two
hundred
miles
gradually
people
and
despatches
came
in
who
said
that
they
had
parted
company
with
some
of
the
other
islands
and
continents
but
as
i
say
on
each
piece
the
people
not
only
weighed
much
less
but
were
much
had
less
responsibility
now
will
you
imagine
the
enthusiasm
here
at
miss
hale
school
when
it
should
be
announced
that
geography
in
future
would
be
confined
to
the
study
of
the
region
east
of
the
mississippi
and
west
of
the
atlantic
the
earth
having
parted
at
the
seams
so
named
no
more
study
of
italian
german
french
or
sclavonic
the
people
speaking
those
languages
being
now
in
different
orbits
or
other
worlds
imagine
also
the
superior
ease
of
the
of
the
a
and
kindred
societies
the
duties
of
instruction
and
civilizing
of
evangelizing
in
general
being
reduced
within
so
much
narrower
bounds
for
you
and
me
also
who
can
not
decide
what
gladstone
ought
to
do
with
the
land
tenure
in
ireland
and
who
distress
ourselves
so
much
about
it
in
conversation
what
a
satisfaction
to
know
that
great
britain
is
flung
off
with
one
rate
of
movement
ireland
with
another
and
the
isle
of
man
with
another
into
space
with
no
more
chance
of
meeting
again
than
there
is
that
you
shall
have
the
same
hand
at
whist
that
you
had
last
night
even
victoria
would
sleep
easier
and
i
am
sure
gladstone
would
thus
i
say
were
orcutt
and
responsibilities
so
diminished
that
after
the
first
i
began
to
see
that
their
contracted
position
had
its
decided
compensating
ameliorations
in
these
views
i
need
not
say
the
women
of
our
little
circle
never
shared
after
we
got
the
new
telegraph
arrangement
in
good
i
observed
that
polly
and
annie
haliburton
had
many
private
conversations
and
the
secret
came
out
one
morning
when
rising
early
in
the
cabins
we
men
found
they
had
deserted
us
and
then
going
in
search
of
them
found
them
running
the
signal
boards
in
and
out
as
rapidly
as
they
could
to
tell
brannan
and
the
bride
alice
orcutt
that
flounces
were
worn
an
inch
and
a
half
deeper
and
that
people
trimmed
now
with
harmonizing
colors
and
not
with
contrasts
i
did
not
say
that
i
believed
they
wore
in
but
that
was
my
private
impression
after
all
it
was
hard
to
laugh
at
the
girls
as
these
ladies
will
be
called
should
they
live
to
be
as
old
as
helen
was
when
she
charmed
the
trojan
senate
that
was
if
heyne
be
right
in
his
calculations
it
was
hard
to
laugh
at
them
because
this
was
simple
benevolence
and
the
same
benevolence
led
to
a
much
more
practical
suggestion
when
polly
came
to
me
and
told
me
she
had
been
putting
up
some
baby
things
for
little
io
and
phoebe
and
some
playthings
for
the
older
children
and
she
thought
we
might
send
up
a
bundle
of
course
we
could
there
were
the
flies
still
moving
or
we
might
go
ourselves
and
here
the
reader
must
indulge
me
in
a
long
parenthesis
i
beg
him
to
bear
me
witness
that
i
never
made
one
before
this
parenthesis
is
on
the
tense
that
i
am
obliged
to
use
in
sending
to
the
press
these
minutes
the
reader
observes
that
the
last
transactions
mentioned
happen
in
april
and
may
those
to
be
narrated
are
the
sequence
of
those
already
told
speaking
of
them
in
with
the
coarse
tenses
of
the
english
language
is
very
difficult
one
needs
for
accuracy
a
sure
future
a
second
future
a
future
and
a
future
none
of
which
does
this
language
have
failing
this
one
would
be
glad
of
an
orist
tense
without
time
if
the
grammarians
will
not
swoon
at
hearing
such
language
but
the
english
tongue
hath
not
that
either
doth
the
learned
reader
remember
that
the
hebrew
language
of
history
and
prophecy
hath
only
a
past
and
a
future
tense
but
hath
no
present
yet
that
language
succeeded
tolerably
in
expressing
the
present
griefs
or
joys
of
david
and
of
solomon
bear
with
me
then
o
critic
if
even
in
i
use
the
called
past
tenses
in
narrating
what
remaineth
of
this
history
up
to
the
summer
of
end
of
the
parenthesis
on
careful
consideration
however
no
one
volunteers
to
go
to
go
if
you
observe
would
require
that
a
man
envelop
himself
thickly
in
asbestos
or
some
similar
conducting
substance
leap
boldly
on
the
rapid
flies
and
so
be
shot
through
the
earth
atmosphere
in
two
seconds
and
a
fraction
carrying
with
him
all
the
time
in
a
conducting
receiver
the
condensed
air
he
needed
and
landing
quietly
on
by
a
precalculated
orbit
at
the
bottom
of
our
hearts
i
think
we
were
all
afraid
some
of
us
confessed
to
fear
others
said
and
said
truly
that
the
population
of
the
moon
was
already
dense
and
that
it
did
not
seem
reasonable
or
worth
while
on
any
account
to
make
it
denser
nor
has
any
movement
been
renewed
for
going
but
the
plan
of
the
bundle
of
things
seemed
more
feasible
as
the
things
would
not
require
oxygen
the
only
precaution
seemed
to
be
that
which
was
necessary
for
protecting
the
parcel
against
combustion
as
it
shot
through
the
earth
atmosphere
we
had
not
asbestos
enough
it
was
at
first
proposed
to
pack
them
all
in
one
of
professor
horsford
safes
but
when
i
telegraphed
this
plan
to
orcutt
he
demurred
their
atmosphere
was
but
shallow
and
with
a
little
too
much
force
the
corner
of
the
safe
might
knock
a
very
bad
hole
in
the
surface
of
his
world
he
said
if
we
would
send
up
first
a
collection
of
things
of
no
great
weight
but
of
considerable
bulk
he
would
risk
that
but
he
would
rather
have
no
compact
metals
i
satisfied
myself
therefore
with
a
plan
which
i
still
think
good
making
the
parcel
up
in
heavy
old
woollen
carpets
and
cording
it
with
worsted
cords
we
would
case
it
in
a
larger
than
itself
and
fill
in
the
interstice
with
dry
sand
as
our
best
conductor
cording
this
tightly
again
we
would
renew
the
same
casing
with
more
sand
and
so
continually
offer
surfaces
of
sand
and
woollen
till
we
had
five
separate
layers
between
the
parcel
and
the
air
our
calculation
was
that
a
perceptible
time
would
be
necessary
for
the
burning
and
disintegrating
of
each
if
each
one
on
the
average
would
stand
of
a
second
the
inner
parcel
would
get
through
the
earth
atmosphere
unconsumed
if
on
the
other
hand
they
lasted
a
little
longer
the
bag
as
it
fell
on
would
not
be
unduly
heavy
of
course
we
could
take
their
night
for
the
experiment
so
that
we
might
be
sure
they
should
all
be
in
bed
and
out
of
the
way
we
had
very
funny
and
very
merry
times
in
selecting
things
important
enough
and
at
the
same
time
bulky
and
light
enough
to
be
safe
alice
and
bertha
at
once
insisted
that
there
must
be
room
for
the
playthings
they
wanted
to
send
the
most
approved
of
the
old
ones
and
to
add
some
new
presents
there
was
a
woolly
sheep
in
particular
and
a
that
rose
had
given
fanny
about
which
there
was
some
sentiment
boxes
of
dominos
packs
of
cards
magnetic
fishes
bows
and
arrows
and
croquet
sets
polly
and
annie
were
more
considerate
down
to
coleman
and
company
they
sent
an
order
for
pins
needles
hooks
and
eyes
buttons
tapes
and
i
know
not
what
essentials
rubber
shoes
for
the
children
haliburton
insisted
on
sending
haliburton
himself
bought
dolls
though
i
felt
that
wax
had
been
since
days
the
worst
article
in
such
an
adventure
for
the
babies
he
had
rings
he
had
tin
cows
and
carved
wooden
lions
for
the
bigger
children
tools
for
those
older
yet
and
a
box
of
crochet
tools
for
the
ladies
for
my
part
i
piled
in
literature
a
set
of
my
own
works
the
legislative
reports
of
the
state
of
maine
jean
ingelow
as
i
said
or
intimated
and
both
volumes
of
the
earthly
paradise
all
these
were
packed
in
sand
bagged
and
corded
bagged
sanded
and
corded
again
yet
again
and
again
five
times
then
the
whole
awaited
orcutt
orders
and
our
calculations
at
last
the
moment
came
we
had
at
orcutt
order
reduced
the
revolutions
of
the
flies
to
which
was
as
nearly
as
he
knew
the
speed
on
the
fatal
night
we
had
soaked
the
bag
for
near
twelve
hours
and
at
the
moment
agreed
upon
rolled
it
on
the
flies
and
saw
it
shot
into
the
air
it
was
so
small
that
it
went
out
of
sight
too
soon
for
us
to
see
it
take
fire
of
course
we
watched
eagerly
for
signal
time
they
were
all
in
bed
on
when
we
let
fly
but
the
despatch
was
a
sad
disappointment
nothing
has
come
through
but
two
croquet
balls
and
a
china
horse
but
we
shall
send
the
boys
hunting
in
the
bushes
and
we
may
find
more
two
harpers
and
an
atlantic
badly
singed
but
we
can
read
all
but
the
parts
which
were
most
dry
we
see
many
small
articles
revolving
round
us
which
may
perhaps
fall
in
they
never
did
fall
in
however
the
truth
was
that
all
the
bags
had
burned
through
the
sand
i
suppose
went
to
its
place
wherever
that
was
and
all
the
other
things
in
our
bundle
became
little
asteroids
or
aerolites
in
orbits
of
their
own
except
a
score
or
two
which
persevered
far
enough
to
get
within
the
attraction
of
brick
moon
and
to
take
to
revolving
there
not
having
hit
quite
square
as
the
croquet
balls
did
they
had
five
volumes
of
the
congressional
globe
whirling
round
like
bats
within
a
hundred
feet
of
their
heads
another
body
which
i
am
afraid
was
the
ingham
papers
flew
a
little
higher
not
quite
so
heavy
then
there
was
an
absurd
procession
of
the
woolly
sheep
a
china
cow
a
pair
of
a
lobster
haliburton
had
chosen
to
send
a
wooden
lion
the
wax
doll
a
salter
balance
the
new
york
observer
the
bow
and
arrows
a
nuremberg
rose
and
the
magnetic
fishes
which
gravely
circled
round
and
round
them
slowly
and
made
the
petty
zodiac
of
their
petty
world
we
have
never
sent
another
parcel
since
but
we
probably
shall
at
christmas
gauging
the
flies
perhaps
to
one
revolution
more
the
truth
is
that
although
we
have
never
stated
to
each
other
in
words
our
difference
of
opinion
or
feeling
there
is
a
difference
of
habit
of
thought
in
our
little
circle
as
to
the
position
which
the
holds
somewhat
similar
is
the
difference
of
habit
of
thought
in
which
different
statesmen
of
england
regard
their
colonies
is
a
part
of
our
world
or
is
it
not
should
its
inhabitants
be
encouraged
to
maintain
their
connections
with
us
or
is
it
better
for
them
to
accept
the
situation
and
gradually
wean
themselves
from
us
and
from
our
affairs
it
would
be
idle
to
determine
this
question
in
the
abstract
it
is
perhaps
idle
to
decide
any
question
of
casuistry
in
the
abstract
but
in
practice
there
are
constantly
arising
questions
which
really
require
some
decision
of
this
abstract
problem
for
their
solution
for
instance
when
that
terrible
breach
occurred
in
the
sandemanian
church
which
parted
it
into
the
old
school
and
new
school
parties
haliburton
thought
it
very
important
that
brannan
and
orcutt
and
the
church
in
under
brannan
ministry
should
give
in
their
adhesion
to
our
side
their
church
would
count
one
more
in
our
registry
and
the
weight
of
its
influence
would
not
be
lost
he
therefore
spent
eight
or
nine
days
in
telegraphing
from
the
early
proofs
a
copy
of
the
address
of
the
chautauqua
synod
to
brannan
and
asked
brannan
if
he
were
not
willing
to
have
his
name
signed
to
it
when
it
was
printed
and
the
only
thing
which
haliburton
takes
sorely
in
the
whole
experience
of
the
brick
moon
from
the
beginning
is
that
neither
orcutt
nor
brannan
has
ever
sent
one
word
of
acknowledgment
of
the
despatch
once
when
haliburton
was
very
spirited
i
heard
him
even
say
that
he
believed
they
had
never
read
a
word
of
it
and
that
he
thought
he
and
rob
shea
had
had
their
labor
for
their
pains
in
running
the
signals
out
and
in
then
he
felt
quite
sure
that
they
would
have
to
establish
civil
government
there
so
he
made
up
an
excellent
collection
of
books
de
lolme
on
the
british
constitution
montesquieu
on
laws
story
kent
john
adams
and
all
the
authorities
here
with
ten
copies
of
his
own
address
delivered
before
the
young
men
mutual
improvement
society
of
podunk
on
the
abnormal
truths
of
social
order
he
telegraphed
to
know
what
night
he
should
send
them
and
orcutt
replied
go
to
thunder
with
your
old
we
have
not
had
a
primary
meeting
nor
a
justice
court
since
we
have
been
here
and
we
never
will
have
haliburton
says
this
is
as
bad
as
the
state
of
things
in
kansas
when
because
frank
pierce
would
not
give
them
any
judges
or
laws
to
their
mind
they
lived
a
year
or
so
without
any
orcutt
added
in
his
next
despatch
have
not
you
any
new
novels
send
up
scribe
and
the
nights
and
crusoe
and
the
guardsmen
and
whitney
books
we
have
thackeray
and
miss
austen
when
he
read
this
haliburton
felt
as
if
they
were
not
only
but
and
he
consulted
me
quite
seriously
as
to
telegraphing
to
them
pycroft
course
of
reading
i
coaxed
him
out
of
that
and
he
satisfied
himself
with
a
serious
expostulation
with
george
as
to
the
way
in
which
their
young
folks
would
grow
up
george
replied
by
telegraphing
last
sermon
i
thessalonians
iv
ii
the
sermon
had
four
heads
must
have
occupied
an
hour
and
a
half
in
delivery
and
took
five
nights
to
telegraph
i
had
another
engagement
so
that
haliburton
had
to
sit
it
all
out
with
his
eye
to
shubael
and
he
has
never
entered
on
that
line
of
discussion
again
it
was
as
well
perhaps
that
he
got
enough
of
it
the
women
have
never
had
any
misunderstandings
when
we
had
received
two
or
three
hundred
despatches
from
annie
haliburton
came
to
me
and
said
in
that
pretty
way
of
hers
that
she
thought
they
had
a
right
to
their
turn
again
she
said
this
lore
about
the
albert
nyanza
and
the
north
pole
was
all
very
well
but
for
her
part
she
wanted
to
know
how
they
lived
what
they
did
and
what
they
talked
about
whether
they
took
summer
journeys
and
how
and
what
was
the
form
of
society
where
people
lived
in
such
close
quarters
this
about
the
form
of
society
was
merely
wool
pulled
over
my
eyes
so
she
said
she
thought
her
husband
and
i
had
better
go
off
to
the
biennial
convention
at
assampink
as
she
knew
we
wanted
to
do
and
she
and
bridget
and
polly
and
cordelia
would
watch
for
the
signals
and
would
make
the
replies
she
thought
they
would
get
on
better
if
we
were
out
of
the
way
so
we
went
to
the
convention
as
she
called
it
which
was
really
not
properly
a
convention
but
the
biennial
general
synod
and
we
left
the
girls
to
their
own
sweet
way
shall
i
confess
that
they
kept
no
record
of
their
own
signals
and
did
not
remember
very
accurately
what
they
were
i
was
not
going
to
keep
a
string
of
and
she
said
polly
boldly
it
shall
not
be
written
on
my
tomb
that
i
have
left
more
annals
for
people
to
file
or
study
or
bind
or
dust
or
catalogue
but
they
told
us
that
they
had
begun
by
asking
the
bricks
if
they
remembered
what
maria
theresa
said
to
her
quicker
than
any
signal
had
ever
been
answered
george
orcutt
party
replied
from
the
moon
we
hear
and
we
obey
then
the
had
it
all
to
themselves
the
explained
at
once
to
our
girls
that
they
had
sent
their
men
round
to
the
other
side
to
cut
ice
and
that
they
were
manning
the
telescope
and
running
the
signals
for
themselves
and
that
they
could
have
a
nice
talk
without
any
bother
about
the
or
the
magnetic
pole
as
i
say
i
do
not
know
what
questions
polly
and
annie
put
but
to
give
them
their
due
they
had
put
on
paper
a
coherent
record
of
the
results
arrived
at
in
the
answers
though
what
were
the
numbers
of
the
despatches
or
in
what
order
they
came
i
do
not
know
for
the
session
of
the
synod
kept
us
at
assampink
for
two
or
three
weeks
maria
theresa
husband
francis
duke
of
tuscany
was
hanging
about
loose
one
day
and
the
empress
who
had
got
a
little
tired
said
to
the
maids
of
honor
girls
whenever
you
marry
take
care
and
choose
a
husband
who
has
something
to
do
outside
of
the
house
brannan
was
the
spokesman
we
tried
a
good
many
experiments
about
day
and
night
it
was
very
funny
at
first
not
to
know
when
it
would
be
light
and
when
dark
for
really
the
names
day
and
night
do
not
express
a
great
deal
for
us
of
course
the
pendulum
clocks
all
went
wrong
till
the
men
got
them
overhauled
and
i
think
watches
and
clocks
both
will
soon
go
out
of
fashion
but
we
have
settled
down
on
much
the
old
hours
getting
up
without
reference
to
daylight
by
our
great
gong
at
your
eight
but
when
the
eclipse
season
comes
we
vary
from
that
for
signalling
we
still
make
separate
families
and
alice
is
the
seventh
we
tried
hotel
life
and
we
liked
it
for
there
has
never
been
the
first
quarrel
here
you
ca
quarrel
here
where
you
are
never
sick
never
tired
and
need
not
be
ever
hungry
but
we
were
satisfied
that
it
was
nicer
for
the
children
and
for
all
round
to
live
separately
and
come
together
at
parties
to
church
at
signal
time
and
so
on
we
had
something
to
say
then
something
to
teach
and
something
to
learn
since
the
carices
developed
so
nicely
into
flax
we
have
had
one
great
comfort
which
we
had
lost
before
in
being
able
to
make
and
use
paper
we
have
had
great
fun
and
we
think
the
children
have
made
great
improvement
in
writing
novels
for
the
union
the
union
is
the
old
union
for
christian
work
that
we
had
in
dear
old
no
we
have
two
serial
novels
going
on
one
called
of
carrotook
and
the
other
called
and
downs
the
first
by
levi
ross
and
the
other
by
my
blanche
they
are
really
very
good
and
i
wish
we
could
send
them
to
you
but
they
would
not
be
worth
despatching
we
get
up
at
eight
dress
and
fix
up
at
home
a
sniff
of
air
as
people
choose
breakfast
and
then
we
meet
for
prayers
outside
where
we
meet
depends
on
the
temperature
for
we
can
choose
any
temperature
we
want
from
boiling
water
down
which
is
convenient
after
prayers
an
hour
talk
lounging
walking
and
so
on
no
flirting
but
a
favorite
time
with
the
young
folks
then
comes
work
three
hours
is
the
maximum
in
that
line
of
women
work
as
in
all
worlds
there
are
in
one
of
your
days
but
for
my
part
i
like
it
farmers
and
carpenters
have
their
own
laws
as
the
light
serves
and
the
seasons
dinner
is
seven
hours
after
breakfast
began
always
an
hour
long
as
breakfast
was
then
every
human
being
sleeps
for
an
hour
big
gong
again
and
we
ride
walk
swim
telegraph
or
what
not
as
the
case
may
be
we
have
no
horses
yet
but
the
shanghaes
are
coming
up
into
very
good
dodos
and
ostriches
quite
big
enough
for
a
trot
for
the
children
only
two
persons
of
a
family
take
tea
at
home
the
rest
always
go
out
to
tea
without
invitation
at
big
gong
again
and
we
meet
in
which
is
the
prettiest
hall
church
that
you
ever
saw
we
have
singing
lectures
theatre
dancing
talk
or
what
the
mistress
of
the
night
determines
till
the
curfew
sounds
at
ten
and
then
we
all
go
home
evening
prayers
are
in
the
separate
households
and
every
one
is
in
bed
by
midnight
the
only
law
on
the
is
that
every
one
shall
sleep
nine
hours
out
of
every
only
one
thing
interrupts
this
general
order
three
taps
on
the
gong
means
and
then
i
tell
you
we
are
all
on
hand
you
can
not
think
how
quickly
the
days
and
years
go
by
of
course
however
as
i
said
this
could
not
last
we
could
not
subdue
our
world
and
be
spending
all
our
time
in
telegraphing
our
dear
could
it
be
possible
perhaps
it
was
possible
that
they
there
had
something
else
to
think
of
and
to
do
besides
attending
to
our
affairs
certainly
their
indifference
to
fourth
proclamation
and
to
mr
fish
celebrated
protocol
in
the
tahiti
business
looked
that
way
could
it
be
that
that
little
witch
of
a
belle
brannan
really
cared
more
for
their
performance
of
midsummer
night
dream
or
her
father
birthday
than
she
cared
for
that
pleasant
little
account
i
telegraphed
up
to
all
the
children
of
the
way
we
went
to
muster
when
we
were
boys
together
ah
well
i
ought
not
to
have
supposed
that
all
worlds
were
like
this
old
world
indeed
i
often
say
this
is
the
queerest
world
i
ever
knew
perhaps
theirs
is
not
so
queer
and
it
is
i
who
am
the
oddity
of
course
it
could
not
last
we
just
arranged
correspondence
days
when
we
would
send
to
them
and
they
to
us
i
was
meanwhile
turned
out
from
my
place
at
tamworth
observatory
not
but
i
did
my
work
well
and
polly
hers
the
observer
room
was
a
miracle
of
neatness
the
children
were
kept
in
the
basement
visitors
were
received
with
great
courtesy
and
all
the
fees
were
sent
to
the
treasurer
he
got
three
dollars
and
eleven
cents
one
summer
that
was
the
year
general
grant
came
there
and
that
was
the
largest
amount
that
they
ever
received
from
any
source
but
begging
i
was
not
unfaithful
to
my
trust
nor
was
it
for
such
infidelity
that
i
was
removed
no
but
it
was
discovered
that
i
was
a
sandemanian
a
glassite
as
in
derision
i
was
called
the
annual
meeting
of
the
trustees
came
round
there
was
a
large
mechanics
fair
in
tamworth
at
the
time
and
an
agricultural
convention
there
was
no
at
the
convention
but
there
were
two
competitive
examinations
in
which
running
horses
competed
with
each
other
and
trotting
horses
competed
with
each
other
and
five
thousand
dollars
was
given
to
the
best
runner
and
the
best
trotter
these
causes
drew
all
the
trustees
together
the
rev
cephas
philpotts
presided
his
doctrines
with
regard
to
free
agency
were
considered
much
more
sound
than
mine
he
took
the
chair
in
that
pretty
observatory
parlor
which
polly
had
made
so
bright
with
smilax
and
ivy
of
course
i
took
no
chair
i
waited
as
a
janitor
should
at
the
door
then
a
brief
address
philpotts
trusted
that
the
observatory
might
always
be
administered
in
the
interests
of
science
of
true
science
of
that
science
which
rightly
distinguishes
between
unlicensed
liberty
and
true
freedom
between
the
unrestrained
volition
and
the
freedom
of
the
will
he
became
eloquent
he
became
noisy
he
sat
down
then
three
other
men
spoke
on
similar
subjects
then
the
executive
committee
which
had
appointed
me
was
dismissed
with
thanks
then
a
new
executive
committee
was
chosen
with
philpotts
at
the
head
the
next
day
i
was
discharged
and
the
next
week
the
philpotts
family
moved
into
the
observatory
and
their
second
girl
now
takes
care
of
the
instruments
i
returned
to
the
cure
of
souls
and
to
healing
the
hurt
of
my
people
on
observation
days
somebody
runs
down
to
no
and
by
means
of
shubael
communicates
with
we
love
them
and
they
love
us
all
the
same
nor
do
we
grieve
for
them
as
we
did
coming
home
from
pigeon
cove
in
october
with
those
nice
wadsworth
people
we
fell
to
talking
as
to
the
why
and
wherefore
of
the
summer
life
we
had
led
how
was
it
that
it
was
so
charming
and
why
were
we
a
little
loath
to
come
back
to
more
comfortable
surroundings
i
hate
the
school
said
george
wadsworth
i
hate
the
making
calls
said
his
mother
i
hate
the
office
hour
said
her
poor
husband
if
there
were
only
a
dozen
i
would
not
mind
but
seventeen
hundred
thousand
in
sixty
minutes
is
too
many
so
that
led
to
asking
how
many
of
us
there
had
been
at
pigeon
cove
the
children
counted
up
all
the
six
families
the
haliburtons
the
wadsworths
the
pontefracts
the
midges
the
hayeses
and
the
inghams
and
the
two
girls
in
all
and
the
two
babies
born
this
summer
really
said
wadsworth
i
have
not
spoken
to
a
human
being
besides
these
since
june
and
what
is
more
ingham
i
have
not
wanted
to
we
have
really
lived
in
a
little
world
of
our
own
world
of
our
own
polly
fairly
jumped
from
her
seat
to
wadsworth
wonder
so
we
had
lived
in
a
world
of
our
own
polly
reads
no
newspaper
since
the
sandemanian
was
merged
she
has
a
letter
or
two
tumble
in
sometimes
but
not
many
and
the
truth
was
that
she
had
been
more
secluded
from
general
grant
and
gladstone
and
the
khedive
and
the
rest
of
the
important
people
than
had
brannan
or
ross
or
any
of
them
and
it
had
been
the
happiest
summer
she
had
ever
known
can
it
be
possible
that
all
human
sympathies
can
thrive
and
all
human
powers
be
exercised
and
all
human
joys
increase
if
we
live
with
all
our
might
with
the
thirty
or
forty
people
next
to
us
telegraphing
kindly
to
all
other
people
to
be
sure
can
it
be
possible
that
our
passion
for
large
cities
and
large
parties
and
large
theatres
and
large
churches
develops
no
faith
nor
hope
nor
love
which
would
not
find
aliment
and
exercise
in
a
little
world
of
our
own
crusoe
in
new
york
part
i
i
was
born
in
the
year
in
the
city
of
new
york
of
a
good
family
though
not
of
that
country
my
father
being
a
foreigner
of
bremen
who
settled
first
in
england
he
got
a
good
estate
by
merchandise
and
afterward
lived
at
new
york
but
first
he
had
married
my
mother
whose
relations
were
named
robinson
a
very
good
family
in
her
country
and
from
them
i
was
named
my
father
died
before
i
can
remember
at
least
i
believe
so
for
although
i
sometimes
figure
to
myself
a
grave
elderly
man
thickset
and
wearing
a
brimmed
hat
holding
me
between
his
knees
and
advising
me
seriously
i
can
not
say
really
whether
this
were
my
father
or
no
or
rather
whether
this
is
really
some
one
i
remember
or
no
for
my
mother
with
whom
i
have
lived
alone
much
of
my
life
as
the
reader
will
see
has
talked
to
me
of
my
father
so
much
and
has
described
him
to
me
so
faithfully
that
i
can
not
tell
but
it
is
her
description
of
him
that
i
recollect
so
easily
and
so
as
i
say
i
can
not
tell
whether
i
remember
him
or
no
he
never
lost
his
german
notions
and
perhaps
they
gained
in
england
some
new
force
as
to
the
way
in
which
boys
should
be
bred
at
least
for
myself
i
know
that
he
left
to
my
mother
strict
charge
that
i
should
be
bound
to
a
carpenter
as
soon
as
i
was
turned
of
fourteen
i
have
often
heard
her
say
that
this
was
the
last
thing
he
spoke
to
her
of
when
he
was
dying
and
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
she
promised
him
it
should
be
so
and
though
it
cost
her
a
world
of
trouble
so
changed
were
times
and
customs
to
find
an
master
who
would
take
me
for
an
apprentice
she
was
as
good
as
her
word
i
should
like
to
tell
the
story
of
my
apprenticeship
if
i
supposed
the
reader
cared
as
much
about
it
as
i
do
but
i
must
rather
come
to
that
part
of
my
life
which
is
remarkable
than
hold
to
that
which
is
more
like
the
life
of
many
other
boys
my
father
property
was
lost
or
was
wasted
i
know
not
how
so
that
my
poor
mother
had
but
a
hard
time
of
it
and
when
i
was
just
turned
of
and
was
free
of
my
apprenticeship
she
had
but
little
to
live
upon
but
what
i
could
bring
home
and
what
she
could
earn
by
her
needle
this
was
no
grief
to
me
for
i
was
fond
of
my
trade
and
i
had
learned
it
well
my
old
master
was
fond
of
me
and
would
trust
me
with
work
of
a
good
deal
of
responsibility
i
neither
drank
nor
smoked
nor
was
i
of
the
amusements
which
took
up
a
good
deal
of
the
time
of
my
i
was
most
pleased
when
on
i
could
carry
home
to
my
mother
ten
fifteen
or
even
twenty
dollars
could
throw
it
into
her
lap
and
kiss
her
and
make
her
kiss
me
here
is
the
oil
for
the
lamp
my
darling
i
would
say
or
here
is
the
grease
for
the
wheels
or
now
you
must
give
me
white
sugar
twice
a
day
she
was
a
good
manager
and
she
made
both
ends
meet
very
well
i
had
no
thought
of
leaving
my
master
when
my
apprenticeship
was
over
nor
had
he
any
thought
of
letting
me
go
we
understood
each
other
well
he
liked
me
and
i
liked
him
he
knew
that
he
had
in
me
one
man
who
was
not
afraid
of
work
as
he
would
say
and
who
would
not
shirk
it
and
so
indeed
he
would
often
put
me
in
charge
of
parties
of
workmen
who
were
much
older
than
i
was
so
it
was
that
it
happened
perhaps
some
months
after
i
had
become
a
journeyman
that
he
told
me
to
take
a
gang
of
men
whom
he
named
and
to
go
quite
in
the
city
to
put
a
close
wooden
fence
around
a
vacant
lot
of
land
there
one
of
his
regular
employers
had
come
to
him
to
say
that
this
lot
of
land
was
to
be
enclosed
and
the
work
was
to
be
done
by
him
he
had
sent
round
the
lumber
and
he
told
me
that
i
would
find
it
on
the
ground
he
gave
me
in
writing
the
general
directions
by
which
the
fence
was
ordered
and
told
me
to
use
my
best
judgment
in
carrying
them
out
only
take
care
said
he
that
you
do
it
as
well
as
if
i
was
there
myself
do
not
be
in
a
hurry
and
be
sure
your
work
stands
i
was
well
pleased
to
be
left
thus
to
my
own
judgment
i
had
no
fear
of
failing
to
do
the
job
well
or
of
displeasing
my
old
master
or
his
employer
if
i
had
any
doubts
they
were
about
the
men
who
were
to
work
under
my
lead
whom
i
did
not
rate
at
all
equally
and
if
i
could
have
had
my
pick
i
should
have
thrown
out
some
of
the
more
sulky
and
lazy
of
them
and
should
have
chosen
from
the
other
hands
but
youngsters
must
not
be
choosers
when
they
are
on
their
first
commissions
i
had
my
party
well
at
work
with
some
laborers
whom
we
had
hired
to
dig
our
when
a
old
man
with
gold
spectacles
and
a
hat
alighted
from
a
cab
upon
the
sidewalk
watched
the
men
for
a
minute
at
their
work
and
then
accosted
me
i
knew
him
perfectly
though
of
course
he
did
not
remember
me
he
was
in
fact
my
employer
in
this
very
job
for
he
was
old
mark
henry
a
quaker
gentleman
of
philadelphia
who
was
guardian
of
the
infant
heirs
who
owned
this
block
of
land
which
we
were
enclosing
my
master
did
all
the
carpenter
work
in
the
new
york
houses
which
mark
henry
or
any
of
his
wards
owned
and
i
had
often
seen
him
at
the
shop
in
consultation
i
turned
to
him
and
explained
to
him
the
plans
for
the
work
we
had
already
some
of
the
joists
cut
which
were
to
make
the
posts
to
our
fence
the
old
man
measured
them
with
his
cane
and
said
he
thought
they
would
not
be
long
enough
i
explained
to
him
that
the
fence
was
to
be
eight
feet
high
and
that
these
were
quite
long
enough
for
that
i
know
he
said
i
know
my
young
friend
that
my
order
was
for
a
fence
eight
feet
high
but
i
do
not
think
that
will
do
with
some
surprise
i
showed
him
by
a
pole
how
high
the
fence
would
come
yes
my
young
friend
i
see
i
see
but
i
tell
thee
every
beggar
brat
in
the
ward
will
be
over
thy
fence
before
it
has
been
built
a
week
and
there
will
be
i
know
not
what
devices
of
satan
carried
on
in
the
inside
all
the
junk
from
the
north
river
will
be
hidden
there
and
i
shall
be
in
luck
if
some
stolen
trunk
nay
some
dead
man
body
is
not
stowed
away
there
ah
my
young
friend
if
thee
is
ever
unhappy
enough
to
own
a
vacant
lot
in
the
city
thee
will
know
much
that
thee
does
not
know
now
of
the
exceeding
sinfulness
of
sin
thee
will
know
of
trials
of
the
spirit
and
of
the
temper
that
thee
has
never
yet
experienced
i
said
i
thought
this
was
probable
but
i
thought
inwardly
that
i
would
gladly
be
tried
that
way
the
old
man
went
on
i
said
eight
feet
to
friend
silas
but
thee
may
say
to
him
that
i
have
thought
better
of
it
and
that
i
have
ordered
thee
to
make
the
fence
ten
feet
high
thee
may
say
that
i
am
now
going
to
philadelphia
but
that
i
will
write
to
him
my
order
when
i
arrive
meanwhile
thee
will
go
on
with
the
fence
as
i
bid
thee
and
so
the
old
man
entered
his
cab
again
and
rode
away
i
amused
myself
at
his
notion
for
i
knew
very
well
that
the
and
other
loafers
would
storm
his
wall
as
readily
as
they
would
have
stormed
the
malakoff
or
the
redan
had
they
supposed
there
was
anything
to
gain
by
doing
it
i
had
of
course
to
condemn
some
of
my
posts
which
were
already
cut
or
to
work
them
in
to
other
parts
of
the
fence
my
order
for
spruce
boards
was
to
be
enlarged
by
twenty
per
cent
by
the
old
man
direction
and
this
as
it
happened
led
to
a
new
arrangement
of
my
piles
of
lumber
on
my
vacant
land
and
all
this
it
was
which
set
me
to
thinking
that
night
as
i
looked
on
the
work
that
i
might
attempt
another
enterprise
which
as
it
proved
lasted
me
for
years
and
which
i
am
now
going
to
describe
i
had
worked
diligently
with
the
men
to
set
up
some
fifty
feet
of
the
fence
where
it
parted
us
from
an
way
for
i
wanted
a
chance
to
dry
some
of
the
boards
which
had
just
been
hauled
from
a
raft
in
the
north
river
the
truckmen
had
delivered
them
skelter
and
they
lay
still
soaking
above
each
other
on
our
vacant
lot
we
turned
all
our
force
on
this
first
piece
of
fence
and
had
so
much
of
it
done
that
by
calling
off
the
men
just
before
sundown
i
was
able
to
set
up
all
the
wet
boards
each
with
one
end
resting
on
the
fence
and
the
other
on
the
ground
so
that
they
took
the
air
on
both
sides
and
would
dry
more
quickly
of
course
this
left
a
long
dark
tunnel
underneath
as
the
other
hands
gathered
up
their
tools
and
made
ready
to
go
a
fellow
named
mcloughlin
who
had
gone
out
with
one
of
the
three
months
regiments
not
long
before
said
i
would
not
be
sorry
to
sleep
there
i
have
slept
in
many
a
worse
place
than
that
in
dixie
and
on
that
he
went
away
leaving
me
to
make
some
measurements
which
i
needed
the
next
day
but
what
he
said
rested
in
my
mind
and
as
it
happened
directed
the
next
twelve
years
of
my
life
why
should
not
i
live
here
how
often
my
mother
had
said
that
if
she
had
only
a
house
of
her
own
she
should
be
perfectly
happy
why
should
not
we
have
a
house
of
our
own
here
just
as
comfortable
as
if
we
had
gone
a
thousand
miles
out
on
the
prairie
to
build
it
and
a
great
deal
nearer
to
the
to
the
good
music
to
her
old
friends
and
to
my
good
wages
we
had
talked
a
thousand
times
of
moving
together
to
kansas
where
i
was
to
build
a
little
hut
for
her
and
we
were
to
be
very
happy
together
but
why
not
do
as
the
minister
had
bidden
us
only
the
last
sunday
seize
on
and
take
what
providence
offered
now
i
must
acknowledge
that
the
thought
of
paying
any
ground
rent
to
old
henry
did
not
occur
to
me
then
no
nor
for
years
afterward
on
the
other
hand
all
that
i
thought
of
was
this
that
here
was
as
good
a
chance
as
there
was
in
kansas
to
live
without
rent
and
that
rent
had
been
was
still
and
was
likely
to
be
my
bugbear
unless
i
hit
on
some
such
scheme
as
this
for
abating
it
the
plan
to
be
short
filled
my
mind
there
was
nothing
in
the
way
of
which
i
shrank
from
now
for
in
learning
my
trade
i
had
won
my
lamp
and
i
could
build
my
mother
a
palace
if
she
had
needed
one
pleased
with
my
fancy
before
it
was
dark
i
had
explored
my
principality
from
every
corner
and
learned
all
its
capabilities
the
lot
was
an
oblong
nearly
three
times
as
long
as
it
was
wide
on
the
west
side
which
was
one
of
the
short
sides
it
faced
what
i
will
call
the
avenue
and
on
the
south
side
what
i
will
call
fernando
street
though
really
it
was
one
of
the
with
numbers
running
to
the
east
it
came
to
a
narrow
which
had
been
reserved
for
the
accommodation
of
the
rear
of
a
church
which
fronted
on
the
street
just
north
of
us
our
back
line
was
also
the
back
line
of
the
yards
of
the
houses
on
the
same
street
but
on
our
northeast
corner
the
church
ran
back
as
far
as
the
back
line
of
both
houses
and
yards
and
its
high
brick
wall
nearly
fifty
feet
high
took
the
place
there
of
the
foot
brick
wall
surmounted
by
which
made
their
rear
defence
the
moment
my
mind
was
turned
to
the
matter
i
saw
that
in
the
rear
of
the
church
there
was
a
corner
which
lay
warmly
and
pleasantly
to
the
southern
and
western
sun
which
was
still
out
of
from
the
street
pleasantly
removed
from
the
avenue
passing
and
only
liable
to
inspection
indeed
from
the
on
the
opposite
side
of
our
street
houses
which
at
this
moment
were
not
quite
finished
though
they
would
be
occupied
soon
if
therefore
i
could
hit
on
some
way
of
screening
my
mother
castle
from
them
for
a
castle
i
called
it
from
the
first
moment
though
it
was
to
be
much
more
like
a
cottage
i
need
fear
no
observation
from
other
quarters
for
the
avenue
was
broad
and
on
the
other
side
from
us
there
was
a
range
of
low
rambling
buildings
an
and
a
long
were
two
which
had
but
one
story
most
of
them
bad
been
built
i
suppose
only
to
earn
something
for
the
land
while
it
was
growing
valuable
the
church
had
no
windows
in
the
rear
and
that
protected
my
castle
which
was
indeed
still
in
the
air
from
all
observation
on
that
side
i
told
my
mother
nothing
of
all
this
when
i
went
home
but
i
did
tell
her
that
i
had
some
calculations
to
make
for
my
work
and
that
was
enough
she
went
on
sweet
soul
without
speaking
a
word
with
her
knitting
and
her
sewing
at
her
end
of
the
table
only
getting
up
to
throw
a
cloth
over
her
parrot
cage
when
he
was
noisy
and
i
sat
at
my
end
of
the
table
at
work
over
my
figures
as
silent
as
if
i
had
been
on
a
desert
island
before
bedtime
i
had
quite
satisfied
myself
with
the
plan
of
a
very
pretty
little
house
which
would
come
quite
within
our
space
our
means
and
our
shelter
there
was
a
little
passage
which
ran
quite
across
from
east
to
west
on
the
church
side
of
this
there
was
my
kitchen
which
was
to
be
what
i
fondly
marked
the
this
was
quite
long
from
east
to
west
and
not
more
than
half
as
long
the
other
way
but
on
the
east
side
where
i
could
have
no
windows
i
cut
off
on
its
whole
width
a
deep
closet
and
this
proved
a
very
fortunate
thing
afterward
as
you
shall
see
on
the
west
side
i
made
one
large
square
window
and
there
was
of
course
a
door
into
the
passage
on
the
south
side
of
the
passage
i
made
three
rooms
each
narrow
and
long
the
two
outside
rooms
i
meant
to
light
from
the
top
whether
i
would
put
any
skylight
into
the
room
between
them
i
was
not
quite
so
certain
i
did
not
expect
visitors
in
my
new
house
so
i
did
not
mark
it
a
in
the
plan
but
i
thought
of
it
as
a
and
as
such
indeed
for
many
years
we
used
it
though
at
last
i
found
it
more
convenient
to
cut
a
in
the
roof
there
also
but
i
am
getting
before
my
story
before
i
had
gone
to
bed
that
night
i
had
made
a
careful
estimate
as
to
how
much
lumber
i
should
need
of
different
kinds
for
my
little
house
for
i
had
of
course
no
right
to
use
my
master
lumber
nor
henry
nor
had
i
any
thought
of
doing
so
i
made
out
an
estimate
that
would
be
quite
full
for
shingles
for
clapboards
white
pine
for
my
floors
and
finish
for
i
meant
to
make
a
good
job
of
it
if
i
made
any
and
for
laths
for
the
inside
work
i
made
another
list
of
the
locks
hinges
window
furniture
and
other
hardware
i
should
need
but
for
this
i
cared
less
as
i
need
not
order
them
so
soon
i
could
scarcely
refrain
from
showing
my
plan
to
my
mother
so
snug
and
comfortable
did
it
look
already
but
i
had
already
determined
that
the
city
house
should
be
a
present
to
her
on
her
next
birthday
and
that
till
then
i
would
keep
it
a
secret
from
her
as
from
all
the
world
so
i
refrained
the
next
morning
i
told
my
master
what
the
old
quaker
had
directed
about
the
fence
and
i
took
his
order
for
the
new
lumber
we
should
need
to
raise
the
height
as
was
proposed
at
the
same
time
i
told
him
that
we
were
all
annoyed
at
the
need
of
carrying
our
tools
back
and
forth
and
because
we
could
only
take
the
nails
for
one
day
use
and
that
if
he
were
willing
i
had
a
mind
to
risk
an
old
chest
i
had
with
the
nails
in
it
and
a
few
tools
which
i
thought
i
could
so
hide
that
the
rats
and
other
loafers
should
not
discover
it
he
told
me
to
do
as
i
pleased
that
he
would
risk
the
nails
if
i
would
risk
my
tools
and
so
by
borrowing
what
we
call
a
for
a
few
days
i
was
able
to
take
up
my
own
little
things
to
the
lot
without
his
asking
any
other
questions
or
without
exciting
the
curiosity
of
mcloughlin
or
any
other
of
the
men
of
course
he
would
have
sent
up
in
the
anything
we
needed
but
it
was
far
out
of
the
way
and
nobody
wanted
to
drive
the
team
back
at
night
if
we
could
do
without
and
so
as
night
came
on
i
left
the
men
at
their
work
and
having
loaded
my
with
a
small
chest
i
had
i
took
that
into
the
of
which
i
told
you
before
carried
my
box
of
tools
into
the
corner
between
the
church
and
our
fence
under
the
boards
which
we
had
set
up
that
day
and
covered
it
heavily
with
mcloughlin
help
with
joists
and
boards
so
that
no
light
work
would
remove
them
if
indeed
any
wanderer
of
the
night
suspected
that
the
box
was
there
i
took
the
out
into
the
and
chained
it
first
by
the
wheel
and
then
by
the
handle
in
two
staples
which
i
drove
there
i
had
another
purpose
in
this
as
you
shall
see
but
most
of
all
i
wanted
to
test
both
the
police
and
the
knavishness
of
the
neighborhood
by
seeing
if
the
were
there
in
the
morning
to
my
great
joy
it
was
and
to
my
greater
joy
it
remained
there
unmolested
all
the
rest
of
the
week
in
which
we
worked
there
for
my
master
who
never
came
near
us
himself
increased
our
force
for
us
on
the
third
day
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
week
or
saturday
night
the
job
was
nearly
done
and
well
done
too
on
the
third
day
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
throw
out
in
the
inside
of
our
enclosure
a
sort
of
open
fence
on
which
i
could
put
the
wet
boards
to
dry
which
at
first
i
had
placed
on
our
side
fence
i
told
mcloughlin
what
was
true
enough
that
the
south
sun
was
better
for
them
than
the
sun
from
the
west
so
i
ran
out
what
i
may
call
a
screen
feet
from
the
church
and
parallel
with
it
on
which
i
set
up
these
boards
to
dry
and
to
my
great
joy
i
saw
that
they
would
wholly
protect
the
roof
of
my
little
house
from
any
observation
from
the
houses
the
other
side
of
the
way
while
the
workmen
were
at
work
or
even
after
they
were
inhabited
there
was
not
one
of
the
workmen
with
me
who
had
forethought
enough
or
care
for
our
master
interest
to
ask
whose
boards
those
were
which
we
left
there
or
why
we
left
them
there
indeed
they
knew
the
next
monday
that
i
went
up
with
the
swede
to
bring
back
such
lumber
was
we
did
not
use
and
none
of
them
knew
or
cared
how
much
we
left
there
for
me
i
was
only
eager
to
get
to
work
and
that
day
seemed
very
long
to
me
but
that
monday
afternoon
i
asked
my
master
if
i
might
have
the
team
again
for
my
own
use
for
an
hour
or
so
to
move
some
stuff
of
mine
and
my
mother
and
he
gave
it
to
me
readily
i
had
then
only
to
drive
to
a
friendly
lumberman
where
my
own
stuff
was
already
lying
waiting
for
me
to
load
up
with
the
assistance
of
the
workmen
there
and
to
drive
as
quickly
as
i
could
into
the
church
alley
here
i
looked
around
and
seeing
a
german
who
looked
as
if
he
were
only
a
day
from
bremen
i
made
signs
to
him
that
if
he
would
help
me
i
would
give
him
a
piece
of
scrip
which
i
showed
him
the
man
had
been
long
enough
in
the
country
to
know
that
the
scrip
was
good
for
lager
he
took
hold
manfully
with
me
and
carried
my
timbers
and
boards
into
the
enclosure
through
a
gap
i
made
in
the
fence
for
the
purpose
i
gave
him
his
money
and
he
went
away
as
he
went
to
minnesota
the
next
day
he
never
mentioned
to
anybody
the
business
he
had
been
engaged
in
meanwhile
i
had
bought
my
of
the
man
who
owned
it
i
left
a
little
pile
of
heavy
cedar
logs
on
the
outside
spiking
them
to
each
other
indeed
that
they
should
not
be
easily
moved
and
to
them
and
to
my
posts
i
padlocked
the
nor
was
it
ever
disturbed
during
my
reign
in
those
regions
so
i
had
easy
method
enough
when
i
wanted
a
bundle
or
two
of
laths
or
a
bunch
of
shingles
or
anything
else
for
my
castle
to
bring
them
up
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
and
to
discharge
my
load
without
special
observation
my
pile
of
logs
indeed
grew
eventually
into
a
blind
or
screen
which
quite
protected
that
corner
of
the
church
alley
from
the
view
of
any
in
fernando
street
of
that
whole
summer
happy
and
bright
as
it
all
was
i
look
back
most
often
on
the
first
morning
when
i
got
fairly
to
work
on
my
new
home
i
told
my
mother
that
for
some
weeks
i
should
have
to
start
early
and
that
she
must
not
think
of
getting
up
for
my
breakfast
i
told
her
that
there
was
extra
work
on
a
job
and
that
i
had
promised
to
be
there
at
five
every
day
while
the
summer
lasted
she
left
for
me
a
pot
of
coffee
which
i
promised
her
i
would
warm
when
the
time
for
breakfast
and
dinner
came
and
for
the
rest
she
always
had
my
dinner
ready
in
my
tin
little
did
she
know
then
sweet
saint
that
i
was
often
at
fernando
street
by
past
three
in
the
first
sweet
gray
of
those
summer
days
on
that
particular
day
it
was
really
scarcely
light
enough
for
me
to
find
the
nail
i
drew
from
the
plank
which
i
left
for
my
entrance
when
i
was
fairly
within
and
the
plank
was
replaced
i
felt
that
i
was
indeed
monarch
of
all
i
surveyed
what
did
i
survey
the
church
wall
on
the
north
on
the
south
my
own
screen
of
spruce
boards
now
well
dry
on
the
east
and
west
the
fences
which
i
had
built
myself
and
over
that
on
the
west
god
deep
transparent
sky
in
which
i
could
still
see
a
planet
whose
name
i
did
not
know
it
was
a
heaven
indeed
which
he
had
said
was
as
much
mine
as
his
the
first
thing
of
course
was
to
get
out
my
frame
this
was
a
work
of
weeks
the
next
thing
was
to
raise
it
and
here
the
first
step
was
the
only
hard
one
nor
was
this
so
hard
as
it
would
seem
the
highest
wall
of
my
house
was
no
higher
than
the
fence
we
had
already
built
on
the
church
alley
the
western
wall
if
indeed
a
frame
house
has
any
walls
was
only
eight
feet
high
for
foundations
and
sills
i
dug
deep
in
which
i
set
substantial
cedar
posts
which
i
knew
would
outlast
my
day
and
i
framed
my
sills
into
these
i
made
the
frame
of
the
western
wall
lie
out
upon
the
ground
in
one
piece
and
i
only
needed
a
purchase
high
enough
and
a
block
with
repeating
pulleys
strong
enough
to
be
able
to
haul
up
the
whole
frame
by
my
own
strength
unassisted
the
high
purchase
i
got
readily
enough
by
making
what
we
called
a
near
twenty
feet
high
just
where
my
castle
was
to
stand
i
had
no
difficulty
in
hauling
this
into
its
place
by
a
solid
staple
and
ring
which
for
this
purpose
i
drove
high
in
the
church
wall
my
multiplying
pulley
did
the
rest
and
after
it
was
done
i
took
out
the
staple
and
mended
the
hole
it
had
made
so
the
wall
was
as
good
as
ever
you
see
it
was
nobody
business
what
shanty
or
what
tower
old
mark
henry
or
the
fordyce
heirs
might
or
might
not
put
on
the
vacant
corner
lot
the
fordyce
heirs
were
all
in
nurseries
and
kindergartens
in
geneva
and
indeed
would
have
known
nothing
of
corner
lots
had
they
been
living
in
their
palace
in
fourteenth
street
as
for
mark
henry
that
one
great
achievement
by
which
he
rode
up
to
fernando
street
was
one
of
the
rare
victories
of
his
life
of
which
hundredths
were
spent
in
indeed
if
he
had
gone
there
all
he
would
have
seen
was
his
fence
and
he
would
have
taken
pride
to
himself
that
he
had
it
built
so
high
when
the
day
of
the
first
raising
came
and
the
frame
slipped
into
the
mortises
so
nicely
as
i
had
foreordained
that
it
should
do
i
was
so
happy
that
i
could
scarcely
keep
my
secret
from
my
mother
indeed
that
day
i
did
run
back
to
dinner
and
when
she
asked
me
what
pleased
me
so
i
longed
to
let
her
know
but
i
only
smoothed
her
cheeks
with
my
hands
and
kissed
her
on
both
of
them
and
told
her
it
was
because
she
was
so
handsome
that
i
was
so
pleased
she
said
she
knew
i
had
a
secret
from
her
and
i
owned
that
i
had
but
she
said
she
would
not
try
to
guess
but
would
wait
for
the
time
for
me
to
tell
her
and
so
the
summer
sped
by
of
course
i
saw
my
sweetheart
as
i
then
called
my
mother
less
and
less
for
i
worked
till
it
was
at
the
castle
and
after
it
was
closed
in
so
i
could
work
inside
i
often
worked
till
ten
by
candlelight
i
do
not
know
how
i
lived
with
so
little
sleep
i
am
afraid
i
slept
pretty
late
on
sundays
but
the
castle
grew
and
grew
and
the
which
i
was
most
eager
to
finish
wholly
before
cold
weather
was
in
complete
order
three
full
weeks
before
my
mother
birthday
came
then
came
the
joy
of
furnishing
it
to
this
i
had
looked
forward
all
the
summer
and
i
had
measured
with
my
eye
many
a
bit
of
furniture
and
priced
in
an
unaffected
way
many
an
impossible
finery
so
that
i
knew
just
what
i
could
do
and
what
i
could
not
do
my
mother
had
always
wanted
a
banner
stove
i
knew
this
and
it
was
a
great
grief
to
me
that
she
had
none
though
she
would
never
say
anything
about
it
to
my
great
joy
i
found
a
banner
stove
no
at
a
sort
of
old
which
was
in
fact
an
old
curiosity
shop
not
three
blocks
away
from
ninth
avenue
some
one
had
sold
this
to
them
while
it
was
really
as
good
as
new
and
yet
the
keeper
offered
it
to
me
at
i
hung
round
the
place
a
good
deal
and
when
the
man
found
i
really
had
money
and
meant
something
he
took
me
into
all
sorts
of
alleys
and
where
he
stored
his
old
things
away
i
made
fabulous
bargains
there
for
either
the
old
jew
liked
me
particularly
or
i
liked
things
that
nobody
else
wanted
in
the
days
when
his
principal
customers
were
and
his
principal
business
the
traffic
in
old
cordage
and
copper
he
had
hung
out
as
a
sign
an
old
of
a
ship
that
had
come
to
him
his
place
still
went
by
the
name
of
the
ship
though
it
was
really
as
i
say
a
mere
wreck
a
rambling
old
furniture
shop
of
the
kind
but
after
i
had
safely
carried
the
banner
to
my
new
house
and
was
sure
the
funnel
drew
well
and
that
the
escape
of
smoke
and
sparks
was
carefully
guarded
many
a
visit
did
i
make
to
the
ship
at
early
morning
or
late
in
the
evening
to
bring
away
one
or
another
treasure
which
i
had
discovered
there
under
the
pretence
of
some
of
my
mother
most
precious
tables
and
her
bureau
i
got
them
away
from
her
also
i
knocked
up
with
my
own
hatchet
and
saw
a
which
i
meant
to
have
permanent
in
the
middle
of
the
room
which
was
much
more
convenient
than
anything
i
could
buy
or
carry
and
so
on
the
of
october
the
eve
of
my
mother
birthday
the
was
all
ready
for
her
in
her
own
room
i
had
a
new
carpet
and
a
new
set
of
painted
chamber
furniture
which
i
had
bought
at
the
maker
and
brought
up
piece
by
piece
it
cost
me
nineteen
dollars
and
a
half
for
which
i
paid
him
in
cash
which
indeed
he
wanted
sadly
so
on
the
morning
of
the
of
october
i
kissed
my
mother
forty
times
because
that
day
she
was
forty
years
old
i
told
her
that
before
midnight
she
should
know
what
the
great
surprise
was
and
i
asked
her
if
she
could
hold
out
till
then
she
let
me
poke
as
much
fun
at
her
as
i
chose
because
she
said
she
was
so
glad
to
have
me
at
breakfast
and
i
stayed
long
after
breakfast
for
i
had
told
my
mother
that
it
was
her
birthday
and
that
i
should
be
late
and
such
a
thing
as
my
asking
for
an
hour
or
two
was
so
rare
that
i
took
it
quite
of
course
when
i
did
ask
i
came
home
early
at
night
too
then
i
said
now
sweetheart
the
surprise
requires
that
you
spend
the
night
away
from
home
with
me
perhaps
if
you
like
the
place
we
will
spend
tomorrow
there
so
i
will
take
poll
in
her
cage
and
you
must
put
up
your
things
and
take
them
in
your
hand
she
was
surprised
now
for
such
a
thing
as
an
outing
over
night
had
never
been
spoken
of
before
by
either
of
us
why
rob
she
said
you
are
taking
too
much
pains
for
your
old
sweetheart
and
spending
too
much
money
for
her
birthday
now
do
you
think
that
you
should
really
have
as
good
a
time
say
if
we
went
visiting
together
and
then
came
back
here
for
you
see
she
never
thought
of
herself
at
all
it
was
only
what
i
should
like
most
no
sweetheart
dear
said
i
it
is
not
for
me
this
of
october
it
is
all
for
you
and
outing
is
not
for
me
it
is
for
you
and
i
think
you
will
like
it
and
i
think
poll
will
like
it
and
i
have
leave
for
and
we
will
stay
away
all
as
for
i
said
we
would
leave
some
milk
where
he
could
find
it
and
i
would
leave
a
bone
or
two
for
him
but
i
whistled
rip
my
dog
after
me
i
took
poll
cage
my
mother
took
her
bag
and
locked
and
left
her
door
unconscious
that
she
was
never
to
enter
it
again
a
avenue
car
took
us
up
to
fernando
street
it
was
just
the
close
of
twilight
when
we
came
there
i
took
my
mother
to
church
alley
muttered
something
about
some
friends
which
she
did
not
understand
more
than
i
did
and
led
her
up
the
alley
in
her
confused
surprise
then
i
pushed
aside
my
movable
board
and
while
she
was
still
surprised
led
her
in
after
me
and
slid
it
back
again
what
is
it
dear
rob
tell
me
tell
me
this
way
sweetheart
this
way
this
was
all
i
would
say
i
drew
her
after
me
through
the
long
passage
led
her
into
the
which
was
just
lighted
up
by
the
late
evening
twilight
coming
in
between
the
curtains
of
the
great
square
window
then
i
fairly
pushed
her
to
the
great
roomy
which
i
had
brought
from
the
ship
and
placed
it
where
she
could
look
out
on
the
evening
glow
and
i
said
mother
dear
this
is
the
surprise
this
is
your
new
home
and
mother
dear
your
own
boy
has
made
it
with
his
own
hands
all
for
you
but
rob
i
do
not
understand
i
do
not
understand
at
all
i
am
so
stupid
i
know
i
am
awake
but
it
is
as
sudden
as
a
dream
so
i
had
to
begin
and
to
explain
it
all
how
here
was
a
vacant
lot
that
mark
henry
had
the
care
of
and
how
i
had
built
this
house
for
her
upon
it
and
long
before
i
had
explained
it
all
it
was
quite
dark
and
i
lighted
up
the
pretty
and
i
made
the
fire
in
the
new
banner
with
my
own
hands
and
that
night
i
would
not
let
her
lift
a
kettle
nor
so
much
as
cut
a
loaf
of
bread
it
was
my
feast
i
said
and
i
had
everything
ready
round
to
a
loaf
of
cake
which
i
had
ordered
at
taylor
which
i
had
myself
frosted
and
dressed
and
decorated
with
the
initials
of
my
mother
name
and
when
the
feast
was
over
i
had
the
best
surprise
of
all
unknown
to
my
mother
i
had
begged
from
my
aunt
betsy
my
own
father
portrait
and
i
had
hung
that
opposite
the
window
and
now
i
drew
the
curtain
that
hid
it
and
told
my
sweetheart
that
this
and
the
house
were
her
birthday
presents
for
this
year
and
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
happy
life
which
lasted
nearly
twelve
years
i
could
make
a
long
story
of
it
for
there
was
an
adventure
in
everything
in
the
way
we
bought
our
milk
and
the
way
we
took
in
our
coals
but
there
is
no
room
for
me
to
tell
all
that
and
it
might
not
interest
other
people
as
it
does
me
i
am
sure
my
mother
was
never
sorry
for
the
bold
step
she
took
when
we
moved
there
from
our
tenement
true
she
saw
little
or
no
society
but
she
had
not
seen
much
before
the
conditions
of
our
life
were
such
that
she
did
not
like
to
be
seen
coming
out
of
church
alley
lest
people
should
ask
how
she
got
in
and
excepting
in
the
evening
i
did
not
care
to
have
her
go
in
the
evening
i
could
go
with
her
she
did
not
make
many
calls
because
she
could
not
ask
people
to
return
them
but
she
would
go
with
me
to
concerts
and
to
the
church
parlor
meetings
and
sometimes
to
exhibitions
and
at
such
places
and
on
sundays
she
would
meet
perhaps
one
or
another
of
the
few
friends
she
had
in
new
york
but
we
cared
for
them
less
and
less
i
will
own
and
we
cared
more
and
more
for
each
other
as
soon
as
the
first
spring
came
i
made
an
immense
effort
and
spaded
over
nearly
half
of
the
lot
it
was
ninety
feet
wide
and
over
two
hundred
and
sixty
long
more
than
half
an
acre
so
i
knew
we
could
have
our
own
fresh
vegetables
even
if
we
never
went
to
market
my
mother
was
a
good
gardener
and
she
was
not
afraid
even
to
hoe
the
corn
when
i
was
out
of
the
way
i
dare
say
that
the
people
whom
the
summer
left
in
the
street
above
us
often
saw
her
from
their
back
windows
but
they
did
not
know
as
how
should
they
who
had
the
charge
of
this
lot
and
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
be
surprised
to
see
a
cornfield
there
we
only
raised
green
corn
i
am
fond
of
indian
cake
but
i
did
not
care
to
grind
my
own
corn
and
i
could
buy
sweet
meal
without
trouble
i
settled
the
milk
question
after
the
first
winter
by
keeping
our
own
goats
i
fenced
in
with
a
wire
fence
the
northwest
corner
of
our
little
empire
and
put
there
a
milch
goat
and
her
two
kids
the
kids
were
pretty
little
things
and
would
come
and
feed
from
my
hand
we
soon
weaned
them
so
that
we
could
milk
their
mother
and
after
that
our
flock
grew
and
multiplied
and
we
were
never
again
troubled
for
such
little
milk
as
we
used
some
old
proprietor
in
the
old
dutch
days
must
have
had
an
orchard
in
these
parts
there
were
still
left
two
venerable
wrecks
of
ancient
and
although
they
bore
little
fruit
and
what
they
bore
was
good
for
nothing
they
still
gave
a
compact
and
grateful
shade
i
sodded
the
ground
around
them
and
made
a
seat
beneath
where
my
mother
would
sit
with
her
knitting
all
the
afternoon
indeed
after
the
sods
grew
firm
i
planted
hoops
there
and
many
a
good
game
of
croquet
have
she
and
i
had
together
there
playing
so
late
that
we
longed
for
the
chance
they
have
in
sybaris
where
in
the
evening
they
use
balls
of
colored
glass
with
fireflies
shut
up
inside
on
the
of
february
in
the
year
my
old
master
died
to
my
great
regret
and
i
truly
believe
to
that
of
his
widow
and
her
children
his
death
broke
up
the
establishment
and
i
who
was
always
more
of
a
or
joiner
than
carpenter
or
builder
opened
a
little
shop
of
my
own
where
i
took
orders
for
cupboards
drawers
stairs
and
other
finishing
work
and
where
i
employed
two
or
three
german
journeymen
and
was
thus
much
more
master
of
my
own
time
in
particular
i
had
two
faithful
fellows
natives
of
my
own
father
town
of
bremen
while
they
were
with
me
i
could
leave
them
a
whole
afternoon
at
a
time
while
i
took
any
little
job
there
might
be
and
worked
at
it
at
my
own
house
at
home
where
my
house
was
except
that
it
was
far
uptown
they
never
asked
nor
ever
so
far
as
i
know
cared
this
gave
me
the
chance
for
many
a
pleasant
afternoon
with
my
mother
such
as
we
had
dreamed
of
in
the
old
days
when
we
talked
of
kansas
i
would
work
at
the
lathe
or
the
bench
and
she
would
read
to
me
or
we
would
put
off
the
bench
till
the
evening
and
we
would
both
go
out
into
the
cornfield
together
and
so
we
lived
year
after
year
i
am
afraid
that
we
worshipped
each
other
too
much
we
were
in
the
heart
of
a
crowded
city
but
there
was
that
in
our
lives
which
tended
a
little
to
habits
of
loneliness
and
i
suppose
a
moralist
would
say
that
our
dangers
lay
in
that
direction
on
the
other
hand
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
say
that
as
i
sat
in
a
seat
i
had
made
for
myself
in
old
van
der
tromp
i
would
look
upon
my
corn
and
peas
and
squashes
and
tomatoes
with
a
satisfaction
which
i
believe
many
a
nobleman
in
england
does
not
enjoy
till
the
youngest
of
the
fordyce
heirs
was
of
age
and
that
would
not
be
till
this
was
all
my
own
i
was
by
right
of
possession
and
my
own
labors
lord
of
all
this
region
how
else
did
the
writers
on
political
economy
teach
me
that
any
property
existed
i
surveyed
it
with
a
secret
kind
of
pleasure
i
had
not
abundance
of
pears
what
i
had
were
poor
and
few
but
i
had
abundance
of
sweet
corn
of
tomatoes
of
peas
and
of
beans
the
tomatoes
were
as
wholesome
as
they
were
plentiful
and
as
i
sat
i
could
see
the
long
shelves
of
them
which
my
mother
had
spread
in
the
sun
to
ripen
that
we
might
have
enough
of
them
canned
when
winter
should
close
in
upon
us
i
knew
i
should
have
potatoes
enough
of
my
own
raising
also
to
begin
the
winter
with
i
should
have
been
glad
of
more
but
as
by
any
good
day
work
i
could
buy
two
barrels
of
potatoes
i
did
not
fret
myself
that
my
stock
was
but
small
meanwhile
my
stock
in
bank
grew
fast
neither
my
mother
nor
i
had
much
occasion
to
buy
new
clothes
we
were
at
no
charge
for
insurance
or
taxes
i
remember
that
a
spanish
gentleman
who
was
fond
of
me
for
whom
i
had
made
a
cabinet
with
secret
drawers
paid
me
in
moidores
and
which
in
those
times
of
paper
were
a
sight
to
behold
i
carried
home
the
little
bag
and
told
my
mother
that
this
was
a
birthday
present
for
her
indeed
that
she
was
to
put
it
all
in
her
bed
that
night
that
she
might
say
she
had
rolled
in
gold
and
silver
she
played
with
the
pieces
and
we
used
them
to
count
with
as
we
played
our
game
of
cribbage
but
really
robin
boy
said
she
it
is
as
the
dirt
under
our
feet
i
would
give
it
all
for
three
or
four
pairs
of
shoes
and
stockings
such
as
we
used
to
buy
in
york
but
such
as
these
shoes
and
knit
stockings
have
driven
out
of
the
market
indeed
we
wanted
very
little
in
our
desert
home
and
so
for
many
years
we
led
a
happy
life
and
we
found
more
in
life
than
would
have
been
possible
had
we
been
all
tangled
up
with
the
cords
of
artificial
society
i
say
we
for
i
am
sure
i
did
and
i
think
my
dear
mother
did
but
it
was
in
the
seventh
year
of
our
residence
in
the
hut
that
of
a
sudden
i
had
a
terrible
shock
or
fright
and
this
i
must
now
describe
to
you
it
comes
in
about
the
middle
of
this
history
and
it
may
end
this
chapter
it
was
one
sunday
afternoon
when
i
had
taken
the
fancy
as
i
often
did
of
sundays
to
inspect
my
empire
of
course
in
a
certain
way
i
did
this
every
time
i
climbed
old
van
der
tromp
and
sat
in
my
there
but
a
tour
of
inspection
was
a
different
thing
i
walked
close
round
the
path
which
i
had
made
next
the
fence
of
the
enclosure
i
went
in
among
my
goats
even
entered
the
and
played
with
my
kids
i
tried
the
boards
of
the
fence
and
the
to
be
sure
they
all
were
sound
i
had
paths
enough
between
the
rows
of
corn
and
potatoes
to
make
a
journey
of
three
miles
and
half
a
furlong
with
two
rods
more
if
i
went
through
the
whole
of
them
so
at
four
on
this
fatal
afternoon
i
bade
my
mother
and
kissed
her
i
told
her
i
should
not
be
back
for
two
hours
because
i
was
going
to
inspect
my
empire
and
i
set
out
happily
but
in
less
than
an
hour
i
can
see
the
face
of
the
clock
now
it
was
minutes
after
five
i
flung
myself
in
my
chair
panting
for
breath
and
as
my
mother
said
as
pale
as
if
i
had
seen
a
ghost
but
i
told
her
it
was
worse
than
that
i
had
come
out
from
between
two
high
rows
of
corn
which
wholly
covered
me
upon
a
little
patch
which
lay
warm
to
the
south
and
west
where
i
had
some
melons
and
was
just
lifting
one
of
the
melons
to
be
sure
that
the
under
surface
did
not
rot
when
close
behind
it
i
saw
the
print
of
a
man
foot
which
was
very
plain
to
be
seen
in
the
soft
soil
i
stood
like
one
thunderstruck
or
as
if
i
had
seen
an
apparition
i
listened
i
looked
round
me
i
could
hear
nothing
but
the
roar
of
the
omnibuses
nor
could
i
see
anything
i
went
up
and
down
the
path
but
it
was
all
one
i
could
see
no
other
impression
but
that
one
i
went
to
it
again
to
see
if
there
were
any
more
and
to
observe
if
it
might
not
be
my
fancy
but
there
was
no
room
for
that
for
there
was
exactly
the
print
of
an
englishman
hobnailed
shoe
the
heavy
heel
the
prints
of
the
heads
of
the
nails
there
was
even
a
piece
of
patch
which
had
been
put
on
it
though
it
had
never
been
how
it
came
there
i
knew
not
neither
could
i
in
the
least
imagine
but
as
i
say
like
a
man
perfectly
confused
and
out
of
myself
i
rushed
home
into
my
hut
not
feeling
the
ground
i
went
upon
i
fled
into
it
like
one
pursued
and
as
my
mother
said
when
i
fell
into
my
chair
panting
i
looked
as
if
i
had
seen
a
ghost
it
was
worse
than
that
as
i
said
to
her
part
ii
i
can
not
well
tell
you
how
much
dismay
this
sight
of
a
footprint
in
the
ground
gave
me
nor
how
many
sleepless
nights
it
cost
me
all
the
time
i
was
trying
to
make
my
mother
think
that
there
was
no
ground
for
anxiety
and
yet
all
the
time
i
was
showing
her
that
i
was
very
anxious
the
more
i
pretended
that
i
was
not
troubled
the
more
and
so
the
more
troubled
i
appeared
to
her
and
yet
if
i
made
no
pretence
and
told
her
what
i
really
feared
i
should
have
driven
her
almost
wild
by
the
story
of
my
terrors
to
have
our
pretty
home
broken
up
perhaps
to
be
put
in
the
newspapers
which
was
a
lot
that
so
far
we
had
always
escaped
in
our
quiet
and
modest
life
all
this
was
more
than
she
or
i
could
bear
to
think
of
in
the
midst
of
these
cogitations
apprehensions
and
reflections
it
came
into
my
thoughts
one
day
as
i
was
working
at
my
shop
with
my
men
that
all
this
might
be
a
chimera
of
my
own
and
that
the
foot
might
be
the
print
of
my
own
boot
as
i
had
left
it
in
the
soil
some
days
before
when
i
was
looking
at
my
melons
this
cheered
me
up
a
little
too
i
considered
that
i
could
by
no
means
tell
for
certain
where
i
had
trod
and
where
i
had
not
and
that
if
at
last
this
was
the
print
of
my
own
boot
i
had
played
the
part
of
those
fools
who
strive
to
make
stories
of
spectres
and
then
are
themselves
frightened
at
them
more
than
anybody
else
so
i
returned
home
that
day
in
very
good
spirits
i
carried
to
my
mother
a
copy
of
frank
leslie
illustrated
newspaper
which
had
in
it
some
pictures
that
i
knew
would
please
her
and
i
talked
with
her
in
as
hearted
a
way
as
i
could
to
try
to
make
her
think
that
i
had
forgotten
my
alarm
and
afterward
we
played
two
or
three
games
of
egyptian
solitaire
at
the
table
and
i
went
to
bed
unusually
early
but
at
the
first
break
of
day
when
i
fancied
or
hoped
that
she
was
still
asleep
i
rose
quickly
and
myself
crept
out
to
the
to
examine
again
the
imprint
of
the
foot
and
to
make
sure
that
it
was
mine
alas
it
was
no
more
mine
than
it
was
queen
victoria
if
it
had
only
been
cloven
i
could
easily
have
persuaded
myself
whose
it
was
so
much
grief
and
trouble
had
it
cost
me
when
i
came
to
measure
the
mark
with
my
own
boot
i
found
just
as
i
had
seen
before
that
mine
was
not
nearly
so
large
as
this
mark
was
also
this
was
as
i
have
said
the
mark
of
a
heavy
brogan
such
as
i
never
wore
and
there
was
the
mark
of
a
strange
patch
near
the
toe
such
as
i
had
never
seen
nor
indeed
have
seen
since
from
that
hour
to
this
hour
all
these
things
renewed
my
terrors
i
went
home
like
a
whipped
dog
wholly
certain
now
that
some
one
had
found
the
secret
of
our
home
we
might
be
surprised
in
it
before
i
was
aware
and
what
course
to
take
for
my
security
i
knew
not
as
we
breakfasted
i
opened
my
whole
heart
to
my
mother
if
she
said
so
i
would
carry
all
our
little
property
piece
by
piece
back
to
old
thunberg
the
dealer
and
with
her
parrot
and
my
umbrella
we
would
go
out
to
kansas
as
we
used
to
propose
we
would
give
up
the
game
or
if
she
thought
best
we
would
stand
on
the
defensive
i
would
put
on
the
upper
edges
of
the
fences
all
the
way
round
there
were
four
or
five
odd
revolvers
at
the
ship
and
i
would
buy
them
all
with
powder
and
enough
for
a
long
siege
i
would
teach
her
how
to
load
and
while
she
loaded
i
would
fire
till
they
had
quite
enough
of
attacking
us
in
our
home
now
it
has
all
gone
by
i
should
be
ashamed
to
set
down
in
writing
the
frightful
contrivances
i
hatched
for
destroying
these
creatures
as
i
called
them
or
at
least
frightening
them
so
as
to
prevent
their
coming
thither
any
more
robin
my
boy
said
my
mother
to
me
when
i
gave
her
a
chance
at
last
if
they
came
in
here
whoever
may
be
very
little
is
the
harm
that
they
could
do
us
but
if
kennedy
and
twenty
of
his
police
should
come
in
here
over
the
bodies
of
five
times
five
are
times
eleven
are
two
hundred
and
people
whom
you
will
have
killed
by
that
time
if
i
load
as
fast
as
thee
tells
me
i
can
why
robin
my
boy
it
will
go
hard
for
thee
and
me
when
the
day
of
the
assizes
comes
they
will
put
handcuffs
on
thy
poor
old
mother
and
on
thee
and
if
they
do
not
send
thee
to
jack
ketch
they
will
send
thee
to
bloomingdale
i
could
not
but
see
that
there
was
sense
in
what
she
said
anyway
it
cooled
me
down
for
the
time
and
i
kissed
her
and
went
to
my
work
less
eager
and
indeed
less
anxious
than
i
had
been
the
night
before
as
i
went
in
the
car
i
had
a
chance
to
ask
myself
what
right
i
had
to
take
away
the
lives
of
these
poor
savages
of
the
neighborhood
merely
because
they
entered
on
my
possessions
was
it
their
fault
that
they
had
not
been
apprenticed
to
carpenters
could
they
help
themselves
in
the
arrangements
which
had
left
them
savages
had
any
one
ever
given
them
a
chance
to
fence
in
an
lot
was
it
in
a
word
i
said
to
myself
was
it
my
merit
or
my
good
luck
which
made
me
as
good
as
a
landed
proprietor
while
the
fordyce
heirs
had
their
education
such
thoughts
before
i
came
to
my
shop
had
quite
tamed
me
down
and
when
i
arrived
there
i
was
quite
off
my
design
and
i
concluded
that
i
had
taken
a
wrong
measure
in
my
resolution
to
attack
the
savages
as
i
had
begun
to
call
men
who
might
be
merely
harmless
loafers
it
was
clearly
not
my
business
to
meddle
with
them
unless
they
first
attacked
me
this
it
was
my
business
to
prevent
if
i
were
discovered
and
attacked
then
i
knew
my
duty
with
these
thoughts
i
went
into
my
shop
that
day
and
with
such
thoughts
as
these
and
with
my
mother
good
sense
in
keeping
me
employed
in
pleasanter
things
than
hunting
for
traces
of
savages
i
got
into
a
healthier
way
of
thinking
the
crop
of
melons
came
in
well
and
many
a
good
feast
we
had
from
them
once
and
again
i
was
able
to
carry
a
nice
fresh
melon
to
an
old
lady
my
mother
was
fond
of
who
now
lay
sick
with
a
tertian
ague
then
we
had
the
best
sweet
corn
for
dinner
every
day
that
any
man
had
in
new
york
for
at
delmonico
itself
the
corn
the
grandees
had
had
been
picked
the
night
before
and
had
started
at
two
in
the
morning
on
its
long
journey
to
town
but
my
mother
picked
my
corn
just
at
the
minute
when
she
knew
i
was
leaving
my
shop
she
husked
it
and
put
it
in
the
pot
and
by
the
time
i
had
come
home
had
slipped
up
the
board
in
the
fence
that
served
me
for
a
door
and
had
washed
my
face
and
hands
in
my
own
room
she
would
have
dished
her
dinner
would
have
put
her
fresh
corn
upon
the
table
covered
with
a
pretty
napkin
and
so
as
i
say
i
had
a
feast
which
no
nabob
in
new
york
had
no
indeed
nor
any
king
that
i
know
of
unless
it
were
the
king
of
the
sandwich
islands
and
i
doubt
if
he
were
as
well
served
as
i
so
i
became
more
calm
and
less
careworn
though
i
will
not
say
but
sometimes
i
did
look
carefully
to
see
if
i
could
find
the
traces
of
a
man
foot
but
i
never
saw
another
unless
we
went
out
somewhere
during
the
evening
we
went
to
bed
early
we
rose
early
as
well
for
i
never
lost
the
habits
of
my
apprenticeship
and
so
we
were
both
sound
asleep
in
bed
one
night
when
a
strange
thing
happened
and
a
sudden
fright
came
to
us
of
which
i
must
tell
quite
at
length
for
it
made
indeed
a
very
sudden
change
in
the
current
of
our
lives
i
was
sound
asleep
as
i
said
and
so
i
found
was
my
mother
also
but
i
must
have
been
partly
waked
by
some
sudden
noise
in
the
street
for
i
knew
i
was
sitting
up
in
my
bed
in
the
darkness
when
i
heard
a
woman
scream
a
terrible
cry
and
while
i
was
yet
startled
i
heard
her
scream
again
as
if
she
were
in
deadly
fear
my
window
was
shaded
by
a
heavy
green
curtain
but
in
an
instant
i
had
pulled
it
up
and
by
the
light
of
the
moon
i
seized
my
trousers
and
put
them
on
i
was
well
awake
by
this
time
and
when
i
flung
open
the
door
of
my
house
so
as
to
run
into
my
garden
i
could
hear
many
wild
voices
some
in
english
some
in
german
some
in
irish
and
some
with
terrible
cries
which
i
will
not
pretend
i
could
understand
there
was
no
cry
of
a
woman
now
but
only
the
howling
of
angry
or
drunken
men
when
they
are
in
a
rage
with
some
one
or
with
each
other
what
startled
me
was
that
whereas
the
woman
cry
came
from
the
street
south
of
me
which
i
have
called
fernando
street
the
whole
crowd
of
men
as
they
howled
and
swore
were
passing
along
that
street
rapidly
and
then
stopped
for
an
instant
as
if
they
were
coming
up
what
i
called
church
alley
there
must
have
been
seven
or
eight
of
them
now
it
was
by
church
alley
that
my
mother
and
i
always
came
into
our
house
and
so
into
our
garden
in
the
eight
years
or
nearly
so
that
i
had
lived
there
i
had
by
degrees
accumulated
more
and
more
rubbish
near
the
furthest
end
of
the
alley
as
a
screen
so
to
speak
that
when
my
mother
or
i
came
in
or
out
no
one
in
the
street
might
notice
us
i
had
even
made
a
little
out
from
my
own
to
which
my
was
chained
next
this
i
had
piled
broken
brickbats
and
and
other
heavy
things
that
would
not
be
stolen
there
was
the
stump
and
the
root
of
an
old
there
too
heavy
to
steal
and
too
crooked
and
hard
to
clean
or
saw
there
was
a
bit
of
curbstone
from
the
street
and
other
such
trash
which
quite
masked
the
fence
and
the
cart
on
the
other
side
that
is
the
church
side
or
the
side
furthest
from
the
street
was
the
in
the
fence
where
my
mother
and
i
came
in
so
soon
as
it
was
slid
back
no
man
could
see
that
the
fence
was
not
solid
at
this
moment
in
the
night
however
when
i
found
that
this
riotous
drunken
crew
were
pausing
at
the
entrance
of
church
alley
as
doubting
if
they
would
not
come
down
i
ran
back
through
the
passage
knocking
loudly
for
my
mother
as
i
passed
and
coming
to
my
put
my
eye
at
the
little
hole
through
which
i
always
reconnoitred
before
i
slid
the
door
i
could
see
nothing
nor
at
night
ought
i
to
have
expected
to
do
so
but
i
could
hear
and
i
heard
what
i
did
not
expect
i
could
hear
the
heavy
panting
of
one
who
had
been
running
and
as
i
listened
i
heard
a
gentle
low
voice
sob
out
ach
ach
mein
gott
ach
mein
gott
or
words
that
i
thought
were
these
and
i
was
conscious
when
i
tried
to
move
the
door
that
some
one
was
resting
close
upon
it
all
the
same
i
put
my
shoulder
stoutly
to
the
bar
to
which
the
boards
of
the
door
were
nailed
i
slid
it
quickly
in
its
grooves
and
as
it
slid
a
woman
fell
into
the
passage
she
was
wholly
surprised
by
the
motion
so
that
she
could
not
but
fall
i
seized
her
and
dragged
her
in
saying
hush
hush
hush
as
i
did
so
but
not
so
quick
was
i
but
that
she
screamed
once
more
as
i
drew
to
the
and
thrust
in
the
heavy
bolt
which
held
it
in
an
instant
my
mother
was
in
the
passage
with
a
light
in
her
hand
in
another
instant
i
had
seized
the
light
and
put
it
out
but
that
instant
was
enough
for
her
and
me
to
see
that
here
was
a
lovely
girl
with
no
hat
or
bonnet
on
with
her
hair
floating
wildly
both
her
arms
bleeding
and
her
clothes
all
stained
with
blood
she
could
see
my
mother
face
of
amazement
and
she
could
see
my
finger
on
my
mouth
as
with
the
other
i
dashed
out
the
candle
we
all
thought
quickly
and
we
all
knew
that
we
must
keep
still
but
that
unfortunate
scream
of
hers
was
enough
though
no
one
of
us
all
uttered
another
sound
this
was
like
a
to
bring
all
those
dogs
down
upon
us
the
passage
was
dark
and
to
my
delight
i
heard
some
of
them
breaking
their
shins
over
the
curbstone
and
old
of
my
defences
but
they
were
not
such
hounds
as
were
easily
thrown
off
the
scent
and
there
were
enough
to
persevere
while
the
leaders
picked
themselves
up
again
then
how
they
swore
and
cursed
and
asked
questions
and
we
three
stood
as
still
as
so
many
frightened
rabbits
in
an
instant
more
one
of
them
who
spoke
in
english
said
he
would
be
hanged
if
he
thought
she
had
gone
into
the
church
that
he
believed
she
had
got
through
the
fence
and
then
with
his
fist
or
something
harder
he
began
trying
the
boards
on
our
side
and
others
of
them
we
could
hear
striking
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
when
it
came
to
this
i
whispered
to
my
mother
that
she
must
never
fear
only
keep
perfectly
still
she
dragged
the
frightened
girl
into
our
kitchen
which
was
our
and
they
both
fell
i
know
not
how
into
the
great
for
my
part
i
seized
the
light
ladder
which
always
hung
ready
at
the
door
and
ran
with
it
at
my
full
speed
to
the
corner
of
fernando
street
and
the
alley
i
planted
the
ladder
and
was
on
the
top
of
the
fence
in
an
instant
then
i
sprang
my
watchman
rattle
which
had
hung
by
the
ladder
and
i
whirled
it
round
well
it
wholly
silenced
the
sound
of
the
swearing
fellows
up
the
passage
and
their
pounding
when
i
found
they
were
still
i
cried
out
this
way
this
way
i
have
them
all
penned
up
here
signal
the
office
and
bid
them
send
us
a
sergeant
this
way
fellows
up
church
alley
with
this
i
was
down
my
ladder
again
but
my
gang
of
savages
needed
no
more
i
could
hear
them
rushing
out
of
the
alley
as
fast
as
they
might
not
one
of
them
waiting
for
or
this
was
lucky
for
me
for
as
it
happened
i
was
ten
minutes
older
before
i
heard
two
patrolmen
on
the
outside
wondering
what
frightened
old
cove
had
been
at
the
pains
to
spring
a
rattle
the
moonlight
shone
in
at
the
western
window
of
the
kitchen
so
that
as
i
came
in
i
could
just
make
out
the
figure
of
my
mother
and
of
the
girl
lying
rather
than
sitting
in
her
lap
and
her
arms
i
was
not
afraid
to
speak
now
and
i
told
my
mother
we
were
quite
safe
again
and
she
told
the
poor
girl
so
i
struck
a
match
and
lighted
the
lamp
as
soon
as
i
could
the
poor
frightened
creature
started
as
i
did
so
and
then
fell
on
her
knees
at
my
mother
feet
took
both
her
hands
in
her
own
and
seemed
like
one
who
begs
for
mercy
or
indeed
for
life
my
poor
dear
mother
was
all
amazed
and
her
eyes
were
running
with
tears
at
the
sight
of
the
poor
terror
she
kissed
her
again
and
again
she
stroked
her
beautiful
golden
hair
with
her
soft
hands
she
said
in
every
word
that
she
could
think
of
that
she
was
quite
safe
now
and
must
not
think
of
being
frightened
any
more
but
it
was
clear
in
a
moment
that
the
girl
could
not
understand
any
language
that
we
could
speak
my
mother
tried
her
with
a
few
words
of
german
and
she
smiled
then
but
she
shook
her
head
prettily
as
if
to
say
that
she
thanked
her
but
could
not
speak
to
her
in
that
way
either
then
she
spoke
eagerly
in
some
language
that
we
could
not
understand
but
had
it
been
the
language
of
hottentots
we
should
have
known
that
she
was
begging
my
mother
not
to
forsake
her
so
full
of
entreaty
was
every
word
and
every
gesture
my
dear
sweet
mother
lifted
her
at
last
into
the
and
made
her
lie
there
while
she
dipped
some
hot
water
from
her
boiler
and
filled
a
large
basin
in
her
sink
then
she
led
the
pretty
creature
to
it
and
washed
from
her
arms
hands
and
face
the
blood
that
had
hardened
upon
them
and
looked
carefully
to
find
what
her
wounds
were
none
of
them
were
deep
though
there
were
ugly
scratches
on
her
beautiful
arms
they
were
cut
by
glass
as
i
guessed
then
and
as
we
learned
from
her
afterward
my
mother
was
wholly
prepared
for
all
such
surgery
as
was
needed
here
she
put
on
two
bandages
where
she
thought
they
were
needed
she
plastered
up
the
other
scratches
with
and
then
as
if
the
girl
understood
her
she
said
to
her
and
now
my
dear
child
you
must
come
to
bed
there
is
no
danger
for
you
more
the
poor
girl
had
grown
somewhat
reassured
in
the
comfortable
little
kitchen
but
her
terror
seemed
to
come
back
at
any
sign
of
removal
she
started
to
her
feet
almost
as
if
she
were
a
wild
creature
but
i
would
defy
any
one
to
be
afraid
of
my
dear
mother
or
indeed
to
refuse
to
do
what
she
bade
when
she
smiled
so
in
her
inviting
way
and
put
out
her
hand
and
so
the
girl
went
with
her
bowing
to
me
or
dropping
a
sort
of
courtesy
in
her
foreign
fashion
as
she
went
out
of
the
door
and
i
was
left
to
see
what
damage
had
been
done
to
my
castle
by
the
savages
as
i
called
them
i
had
sprung
the
rattle
none
too
soon
for
one
of
these
rascals
as
it
proved
i
suppose
it
was
the
same
who
swore
that
she
had
not
gone
into
the
church
with
some
tool
or
other
he
had
in
his
hand
had
split
out
a
bit
of
the
fence
and
had
pried
out
a
part
of
a
plank
i
had
done
my
work
too
well
for
any
large
piece
to
give
way
but
the
moment
i
looked
into
my
i
saw
that
something
was
amiss
i
did
not
like
very
well
to
go
to
the
outside
but
i
must
risk
something
so
i
took
out
a
dark
lantern
which
i
always
kept
ready
sure
enough
as
i
say
the
fellow
had
struck
so
hard
and
so
well
that
he
had
split
out
a
piece
of
board
and
a
little
coal
even
had
fallen
upon
the
i
was
not
much
displeased
at
this
for
if
he
thought
no
nearer
the
truth
than
that
he
had
broken
into
a
of
the
church
why
he
was
far
enough
from
his
mark
for
me
after
finding
this
however
i
was
anxious
enough
lest
any
of
them
should
return
not
to
go
to
bed
again
that
night
but
all
was
still
as
death
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
fell
asleep
in
my
chair
i
doubt
whether
my
mother
slept
or
her
frightened
charge
i
was
at
work
in
the
passage
early
the
next
morning
with
some
boards
i
had
and
before
nine
i
had
doubled
all
that
piece
of
fence
from
my
wing
where
my
was
to
the
church
and
i
had
spiked
the
new
boards
on
which
looked
like
old
boards
as
i
said
with
tenpenny
nails
so
that
he
would
be
a
stout
burglar
who
would
cut
through
them
unless
he
had
tools
for
his
purpose
and
daylight
to
work
by
as
i
was
gathering
up
my
tools
to
go
in
a
coarse
irishman
came
walking
up
the
alley
and
looked
round
my
work
was
so
well
done
and
i
had
been
so
careful
to
leave
no
chips
that
even
then
he
could
not
have
guessed
that
i
had
been
building
the
fence
anew
though
i
fancied
he
looked
at
it
he
seemed
to
want
to
excuse
himself
for
being
there
at
all
and
asked
me
with
an
oath
and
in
a
broad
irish
brogue
if
there
were
no
other
passage
through
i
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
say
in
german
wollen
sie
sprechen
deutsch
and
so
made
as
if
i
could
not
understand
him
and
then
kneeling
on
the
of
the
church
pretended
to
put
a
key
into
the
lock
as
if
i
were
making
sure
that
i
had
made
it
firm
and
with
that
he
turned
round
with
another
oath
as
if
he
had
come
out
of
his
way
and
went
out
of
the
alley
closely
followed
by
me
i
watched
him
as
long
as
i
dared
but
as
he
showed
no
sign
of
going
back
to
the
alley
i
at
last
walked
round
a
square
with
my
tools
and
so
came
back
to
my
mother
and
the
pretty
stranger
my
mother
had
been
trying
to
get
at
her
story
she
made
her
understand
a
few
words
of
german
but
they
talked
by
signs
and
smiles
and
tears
and
kisses
much
more
than
by
words
and
by
this
time
they
understood
each
other
so
well
that
my
mother
had
persuaded
her
not
to
go
away
that
day
nor
did
she
go
out
for
many
days
after
i
will
go
before
my
story
far
enough
to
say
that
she
had
indeed
been
horribly
frightened
that
night
and
she
was
as
loath
to
go
out
again
into
the
streets
of
new
york
as
i
should
be
to
plunge
from
a
safe
shore
into
some
terrible
howling
ocean
or
indeed
as
one
who
found
himself
safe
at
home
would
be
to
trust
himself
to
the
tender
mercies
of
a
tribe
of
cannibals
two
such
loving
women
as
they
were
were
not
long
in
building
up
a
language
especially
as
my
mother
had
learned
from
my
father
and
his
friends
in
her
early
life
some
of
the
common
words
of
german
what
she
called
a
german
for
our
new
inmate
was
a
swedish
girl
her
story
in
short
was
this
she
had
been
in
new
york
but
two
days
on
the
voyage
over
they
had
had
some
terrible
sickness
on
the
vessel
and
the
poor
child
mother
had
died
very
suddenly
and
had
been
buried
in
the
sea
her
father
had
died
long
before
this
was
as
you
may
think
a
terrible
shock
to
her
but
she
had
hoped
and
hoped
for
the
voyage
to
come
to
an
end
because
there
was
a
certain
brother
of
hers
in
america
whom
they
were
to
meet
at
their
landing
and
though
she
was
very
lonely
on
the
in
which
she
and
her
mother
and
a
certain
family
of
the
name
of
hantsen
of
whom
she
had
much
to
say
were
the
only
swedes
still
she
expected
to
find
the
brother
almost
as
soon
as
i
may
say
as
they
saw
the
land
she
felt
badly
enough
that
he
did
not
come
on
board
with
the
quarantine
officer
when
the
passengers
were
brought
to
castle
garden
and
no
brother
came
she
felt
worse
however
with
the
help
of
the
clerks
there
she
got
off
a
letter
to
him
somewhere
in
jersey
and
proposed
to
wait
as
long
as
they
would
let
her
till
he
should
come
the
second
day
there
came
a
man
to
the
garden
who
said
he
was
a
dane
but
he
spoke
swedish
well
enough
he
said
her
brother
was
sick
and
had
sent
him
to
find
her
she
was
to
come
with
her
trunks
and
her
mother
and
all
their
affairs
to
his
house
and
the
same
afternoon
they
should
go
to
where
the
brother
was
without
doubt
or
fear
she
went
with
this
man
and
spent
the
day
at
a
forlorn
sort
of
hotel
which
she
described
but
which
i
never
could
find
again
toward
night
the
man
came
again
and
bade
her
take
a
bag
with
her
one
change
of
dress
and
come
with
him
to
her
brother
after
a
long
ride
through
the
city
they
got
out
at
a
house
which
thank
god
was
only
one
block
from
fernando
street
and
there
this
simple
innocent
creature
as
she
went
in
asked
where
her
brother
was
to
meet
only
a
burst
of
laughter
from
one
or
two
looking
men
and
from
girls
whom
she
hated
she
said
the
minute
she
saw
them
except
that
an
old
woman
took
off
her
shawl
and
cloak
and
bonnet
and
took
away
from
her
the
travelling
things
she
had
in
her
hand
nobody
took
any
care
of
her
but
to
laugh
at
her
and
mock
her
if
she
dared
say
anything
she
tried
to
go
out
to
the
door
to
find
even
the
dane
who
had
brought
her
there
but
she
was
given
to
understand
that
he
was
coming
again
for
her
and
that
she
must
wait
till
he
came
as
for
her
brother
there
was
no
brother
there
nor
had
been
any
the
poor
girl
had
been
trapped
and
saw
that
she
had
been
trapped
she
had
been
spirited
away
from
everybody
who
ever
heard
of
her
mother
and
was
in
the
clutches
as
she
said
to
my
mother
afterward
of
a
crew
of
devils
who
knew
nothing
of
love
or
of
mercy
they
did
try
to
make
her
eat
and
drink
tried
to
make
her
drink
champagne
or
any
other
wine
but
they
had
no
fool
to
deal
with
the
girl
did
not
i
think
let
her
captors
know
how
desperate
were
her
resolutions
but
her
eyes
were
wide
open
and
she
was
not
going
to
lose
any
chance
she
was
all
on
the
alert
for
her
escape
when
at
eleven
the
dane
came
at
last
whom
she
had
been
expecting
so
anxiously
the
girl
asked
him
for
her
brother
only
to
be
put
off
by
one
excuse
or
another
and
then
to
hear
from
him
the
most
loathsome
talk
of
his
admiration
not
to
say
his
passion
for
her
they
were
nearly
alone
by
this
time
and
he
led
her
unresisting
as
he
thought
into
another
smaller
room
brilliantly
lighted
and
as
she
saw
in
a
glance
gaudily
furnished
with
wine
and
fruit
and
cake
on
a
table
a
room
where
they
would
be
quite
alone
she
walked
simply
across
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
great
mirror
then
she
made
some
foolish
little
speech
about
her
hair
and
how
pale
she
looked
then
she
crossed
to
the
sofa
and
sat
upon
it
with
as
tired
an
air
as
he
might
have
expected
of
one
who
had
lived
through
such
a
day
then
she
looked
up
at
him
and
even
smiled
upon
him
she
said
and
asked
him
if
he
would
not
ask
them
for
some
cold
water
the
fellow
turned
into
the
well
pleased
with
her
submission
and
in
the
same
instant
the
girl
was
at
the
window
as
if
she
had
flown
across
the
room
fool
the
window
was
made
fast
not
by
any
moving
bolt
either
it
was
nailed
down
and
it
did
not
give
a
to
her
hand
little
cared
she
for
that
she
sat
on
the
seat
which
was
broad
enough
to
hold
her
she
braced
her
feet
against
the
foot
of
the
bedstead
which
stood
just
near
enough
to
her
she
turned
enough
to
bring
her
shoulder
against
the
and
then
with
her
whole
force
she
heaved
herself
against
the
sash
and
the
entire
window
of
course
gave
way
the
girl
caught
herself
upon
the
blind
which
swung
open
before
her
she
pulled
herself
free
from
the
sill
and
and
dropped
fearless
into
the
street
the
fall
was
not
long
she
lighted
on
her
feet
and
ran
as
only
fear
could
teach
her
to
run
where
to
she
knew
not
but
she
thought
she
turned
a
corner
before
she
heard
any
voices
from
behind
still
she
ran
and
it
was
when
she
came
to
the
corner
of
the
next
street
that
she
heard
for
the
first
time
the
screams
of
pursuers
she
turned
again
like
a
poor
hunted
hare
as
she
was
but
what
was
her
running
to
theirs
she
was
passing
our
long
fence
in
fernando
street
and
then
for
the
first
time
she
screamed
for
help
it
was
that
scream
which
waked
me
she
saw
the
steeple
of
the
church
she
had
a
dim
feeling
that
a
church
would
be
an
asylum
so
was
it
that
she
ran
up
our
alley
to
find
that
she
was
in
a
trap
there
and
then
it
was
that
she
fell
against
my
door
that
she
cried
twice
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
and
that
the
good
god
who
had
heard
her
sent
me
to
draw
her
in
we
had
to
learn
her
language
in
a
fashion
and
she
to
learn
ours
before
we
understood
her
story
in
this
way
but
at
the
very
first
my
mother
made
out
that
the
girl
had
fled
from
savages
who
meant
worse
than
death
for
her
so
she
understood
why
she
was
so
frightened
at
every
sound
and
why
at
first
she
was
afraid
to
stay
with
us
yet
more
afraid
to
go
but
this
passed
off
in
a
day
or
two
she
took
to
my
mother
with
a
sort
of
eager
way
which
showed
how
she
must
have
loved
her
own
mother
and
how
much
she
lost
when
she
lost
her
and
that
was
one
of
the
parts
of
her
sad
story
that
we
understood
no
one
i
think
could
help
loving
my
mother
but
here
was
a
poor
creature
who
i
might
say
had
nothing
else
to
love
seeing
she
had
lost
all
trace
of
this
brother
and
here
was
my
mother
soothing
her
comforting
her
dressing
her
wounds
for
her
trying
to
make
her
feel
that
god
world
was
not
all
wickedness
and
the
girl
in
return
poured
out
her
whole
heart
when
my
mother
explained
to
her
that
she
should
not
let
her
go
away
till
her
brother
was
found
then
for
the
first
time
she
seemed
perfectly
happy
she
was
indeed
the
loveliest
creature
i
ever
put
my
eyes
on
she
was
then
about
nineteen
years
old
of
a
delicate
complexion
naturally
which
was
now
a
little
browned
by
the
she
was
rather
tall
than
otherwise
but
her
figure
was
so
graceful
that
i
think
you
never
thought
her
tall
her
eyes
were
perhaps
and
of
that
strange
gray
which
i
have
heard
it
said
the
goddesses
in
the
greek
poetry
had
still
when
she
was
sad
one
saw
the
less
of
all
this
it
was
not
till
she
forgot
her
grief
for
the
instant
in
the
certainty
that
she
might
rest
with
my
mother
so
that
her
whole
face
blazed
with
joy
that
i
first
knew
what
the
perfect
beauty
of
a
perfect
woman
was
her
name
it
seemed
was
frida
a
name
made
from
the
name
of
one
of
the
old
goddesses
among
the
northmen
the
same
from
whom
our
day
friday
is
named
she
is
the
sister
of
thor
from
whom
thursday
is
named
and
the
daughter
of
wodin
from
whom
wednesday
is
named
i
knew
little
of
all
this
then
but
i
did
not
wonder
when
i
read
afterward
that
this
northern
goddess
was
the
goddess
of
love
the
friend
of
song
the
most
beautiful
of
all
their
divinities
queen
of
spring
and
light
and
everything
lovely
but
surely
never
any
one
took
fewer
of
the
airs
of
a
goddess
than
our
frida
did
while
she
was
with
us
she
would
watch
my
mother
as
if
afraid
that
she
should
put
her
hand
to
a
gridiron
or
a
tin
dipper
she
gave
her
to
understand
in
a
thousand
pretty
ways
that
she
should
be
her
faithful
loving
and
sincere
servant
if
she
would
only
show
her
what
to
do
she
would
work
for
her
as
a
child
that
loved
her
and
so
indeed
she
did
my
dear
mother
would
laugh
and
say
she
was
quite
a
fine
lady
now
for
frida
would
not
let
her
touch
broom
nor
mop
skimmer
nor
the
girl
would
do
anything
but
go
out
upon
an
errand
she
could
not
bear
to
see
the
other
side
of
the
fence
what
she
thought
of
it
all
i
do
not
know
whether
she
thought
it
was
the
custom
in
america
for
young
men
to
live
shut
up
with
their
mothers
in
enclosures
of
half
an
acre
square
or
whether
she
thought
we
two
made
some
peculiar
religious
order
whose
rules
provided
that
one
woman
and
one
man
should
live
together
in
a
convent
or
monastery
of
their
own
or
whether
she
supposed
half
new
york
was
made
up
as
marco
polo
found
pekin
of
cottages
or
of
gardens
i
did
not
know
nor
did
i
much
care
i
could
see
that
here
was
provided
a
companion
for
my
mother
who
was
else
so
lonely
and
i
very
soon
found
that
she
was
as
much
a
companion
for
me
so
soon
as
we
could
understand
her
at
all
i
took
the
name
of
her
brother
and
his
address
when
he
wrote
last
he
was
tending
a
at
a
place
about
seven
miles
away
from
tuckahoe
in
jersey
but
he
said
he
was
going
to
leave
there
at
once
so
that
they
need
not
write
there
he
sent
the
money
for
their
passage
and
promised
as
i
said
to
meet
them
at
new
york
this
was
a
poor
clew
at
the
best
but
i
put
a
good
face
on
it
and
promised
her
i
would
find
him
if
he
could
be
found
and
i
spared
no
pains
i
wrote
to
the
postmaster
at
tuckahoe
and
to
a
minister
i
heard
of
there
i
inquired
of
the
swedish
consuls
in
new
york
and
philadelphia
indeed
in
the
end
i
went
to
tuckahoe
myself
with
her
to
inquire
but
this
was
long
after
however
i
may
say
here
once
for
all
to
use
an
old
phrase
of
my
mother
we
never
found
hide
nor
hair
of
him
and
although
this
grieved
frida
of
course
yet
it
came
on
her
gradually
and
as
she
had
never
seen
him
to
remember
him
it
was
not
the
same
loss
as
if
they
had
grown
up
together
meanwhile
that
first
winter
was
i
thought
the
pleasantest
i
had
ever
known
in
my
life
i
did
not
have
to
work
very
hard
now
for
my
business
was
rather
the
laying
out
work
for
my
men
and
sometimes
a
nice
job
which
needed
my
hand
on
my
lathe
at
home
or
in
some
other
delicate
affair
that
i
could
bring
home
with
me
we
were
teaching
frida
english
my
mother
and
i
and
she
and
i
made
a
great
frolic
of
her
teaching
me
swedish
i
would
bring
home
swedish
newspapers
and
stories
for
her
and
we
would
puzzle
them
out
together
she
as
much
troubled
to
find
the
english
word
as
i
to
find
out
the
swedish
then
she
sang
like
a
bird
when
she
was
about
her
household
work
or
when
she
sat
sewing
for
my
mother
and
she
had
not
lived
with
us
a
fortnight
before
she
began
to
join
us
on
sunday
evenings
in
the
choruses
of
the
methodist
hymns
which
my
mother
and
i
sang
together
so
then
we
made
her
sing
swedish
hymns
to
us
and
before
she
knew
it
the
great
tears
would
brim
over
her
deep
eyes
and
would
run
down
in
pearls
upon
her
cheek
nothing
set
her
to
thinking
of
her
old
home
as
those
sunday
evenings
did
of
a
sunday
evening
we
could
make
her
go
out
with
us
to
church
sometimes
not
but
then
she
would
half
cover
her
face
with
a
veil
so
afraid
was
she
that
we
might
meet
the
dane
but
i
told
her
that
the
last
place
we
should
find
him
at
would
be
at
church
on
sunday
evening
i
have
come
far
in
advance
of
my
story
that
i
might
make
any
one
who
reads
this
life
of
mine
to
understand
how
naturally
and
simply
this
poor
lost
bird
nestled
down
into
our
quiet
life
and
how
the
house
that
was
built
for
two
proved
big
enough
for
three
for
i
made
some
new
purchases
now
and
fitted
up
the
little
middle
chamber
for
frida
own
use
we
had
called
it
the
spare
chamber
before
in
joke
but
now
my
mother
fitted
pretty
curtains
to
it
and
other
hangings
without
frida
knowledge
i
had
a
square
of
carpet
made
up
at
the
warehouse
for
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
by
making
her
do
one
errand
and
another
in
the
corner
of
the
garden
one
pleasant
afternoon
in
november
we
had
it
all
prettily
fitted
up
for
her
room
before
she
knew
it
and
a
great
gala
we
made
of
it
when
she
came
in
from
gathering
the
seeds
of
the
calystegia
which
she
had
been
sent
for
she
looked
like
a
northern
flora
as
she
came
in
with
her
arms
all
festooned
by
the
vines
she
had
been
pulling
down
and
when
my
mother
made
her
come
out
to
the
door
she
had
never
seen
opened
before
and
led
her
in
and
told
her
that
this
pretty
chamber
was
all
her
own
the
pretty
creature
flushed
crimson
red
at
first
and
then
her
quick
tears
ran
over
and
she
fell
on
my
neck
and
kissed
her
as
if
she
would
never
be
done
and
then
she
timidly
held
her
hand
out
to
me
too
as
i
stood
in
the
doorway
and
said
in
her
slow
careful
english
and
you
too
and
you
too
i
must
tank
you
both
also
especially
you
are
so
good
so
good
to
de
poor
lost
girl
that
was
a
very
happy
evening
but
as
i
say
i
have
gone
ahead
of
my
story
for
before
we
had
these
quiet
evenings
we
were
fated
to
have
many
anxious
ones
and
one
stormy
one
the
very
first
day
that
frida
was
with
us
i
felt
sure
that
the
savages
would
make
another
descent
upon
us
they
had
heard
her
scream
that
was
certain
they
knew
she
had
not
passed
them
that
was
certain
they
knew
there
was
a
on
the
other
side
of
our
fence
that
was
certain
they
would
have
reason
enough
for
being
afraid
to
have
her
at
large
if
indeed
there
were
no
worse
passion
than
fear
driving
some
of
them
in
pursuit
of
her
i
could
not
keep
out
of
my
mind
the
beastly
look
of
the
irishman
who
asked
me
with
such
an
ugly
leer
on
his
face
if
there
were
no
passage
through
not
that
i
told
either
of
the
two
women
of
my
fears
but
all
the
same
i
did
not
undress
myself
for
a
week
and
sat
in
the
great
in
our
kitchen
through
the
whole
of
every
night
waiting
for
the
least
sound
of
alarm
next
to
the
savages
i
had
always
lived
in
fear
of
being
discovered
in
my
retreat
by
the
police
who
would
certainly
think
it
strange
to
find
a
man
and
his
mother
living
in
a
shed
without
any
practicable
outside
door
in
what
they
called
a
vacant
lot
but
i
have
read
of
weak
nations
in
history
which
were
fain
to
call
upon
one
neighbor
whom
they
did
not
like
to
protect
them
against
another
whom
they
liked
less
i
made
up
my
mind
in
like
wise
to
go
round
to
the
nearest
me
and
so
having
dressed
myself
in
my
black
coat
and
put
on
a
round
hat
and
gloves
i
bought
me
a
malacca
such
as
was
then
in
fashion
and
called
upon
the
captain
in
style
i
told
him
i
lived
next
the
church
and
that
on
such
and
such
a
night
there
was
a
regular
row
among
roughs
and
that
several
of
them
went
storming
up
the
alley
in
a
crowd
i
said
although
your
men
were
there
as
quick
as
they
could
come
these
fellows
had
all
gone
before
they
came
but
then
i
explained
that
i
had
seen
a
fellow
hanging
about
the
alley
in
the
daytime
who
seemed
to
be
there
for
no
good
that
there
was
a
kept
there
by
a
workman
who
seemed
to
be
an
honest
fellow
and
perhaps
all
they
wanted
was
to
steal
that
that
if
i
could
i
would
warn
him
but
meanwhile
i
said
i
had
come
round
to
the
station
to
give
the
warning
of
my
suspicions
that
if
my
rattle
was
heard
again
the
patrolmen
might
know
what
was
in
the
wind
the
captain
was
a
good
deal
impressed
by
my
and
by
the
ease
of
my
manner
he
affected
to
be
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
me
although
we
had
never
happened
to
meet
at
the
century
club
or
at
the
union
league
i
confirmed
the
favorable
impression
i
had
made
by
leaving
my
card
which
i
had
had
handsomely
engraved
robinson
crusoe
with
my
pencil
i
added
my
address
where
i
said
a
note
or
telegram
would
find
me
i
was
not
a
day
too
soon
with
my
visit
to
this
gentleman
that
very
night
after
my
mother
and
frida
had
gone
to
bed
as
i
sat
in
my
easychair
there
came
over
me
one
of
those
strange
intimations
which
i
have
never
found
it
safe
to
disregard
sometimes
it
is
of
good
and
sometimes
of
bad
this
time
it
made
me
certain
that
all
was
not
well
to
relieve
my
fears
i
lifted
my
ladder
over
the
wall
and
dropped
it
in
the
alley
i
swung
myself
down
and
carried
it
to
the
very
end
of
the
alley
to
the
place
where
i
had
dragged
poor
frida
in
the
moon
fell
on
the
fence
opposite
ours
my
and
were
all
in
shade
but
everything
was
safe
there
again
i
chided
myself
for
my
fears
when
as
i
looked
up
the
alley
to
the
street
i
saw
a
group
of
four
men
come
in
stealthily
they
said
not
a
word
but
i
could
make
out
their
forms
distinctly
against
the
houses
opposite
i
was
caught
in
my
own
trap
not
quite
they
had
not
seen
me
for
i
was
wholly
in
shadow
i
stepped
quickly
in
at
my
own
slide
i
pushed
it
back
and
bolted
it
securely
and
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
i
waited
at
my
hole
of
observation
in
a
minute
more
they
were
close
around
me
though
they
did
not
suspect
i
was
so
near
they
also
had
a
and
i
thought
more
than
one
they
spoke
in
low
tones
but
as
they
had
no
thought
they
had
a
hearer
quite
so
near
i
could
hear
all
they
said
i
tell
you
it
was
this
side
and
this
is
the
side
i
heard
their
deuced
day
before
yesterday
what
if
he
did
hear
are
you
going
to
break
into
a
man
garden
because
he
sings
psalms
i
came
here
to
find
out
where
the
girl
went
to
and
now
you
talk
of
and
this
from
another
whose
english
was
poor
and
in
whom
i
fancied
i
heard
the
dane
it
was
clear
enough
that
be
spoke
sense
and
a
sort
of
doubt
fell
on
the
whole
crew
but
speaker
no
with
a
heavy
crowbar
he
had
smashed
into
my
pine
wall
as
i
have
a
right
to
call
it
now
with
a
force
which
made
the
splinters
fly
i
should
think
we
were
all
at
niblo
said
a
man
of
slighter
build
and
that
we
were
playing
humpty
dumpty
because
a
girl
flew
out
of
a
window
you
think
a
fence
opened
to
take
her
in
why
should
she
not
go
through
a
door
and
he
kicked
with
his
foot
upon
the
heavy
sloping
of
the
church
which
just
rose
a
little
from
the
pavement
it
was
the
doorway
which
they
used
there
when
they
took
in
their
supply
of
coal
the
moon
fell
full
on
one
side
of
it
to
my
surprise
it
was
loose
and
gave
way
here
is
where
the
girl
flew
to
and
here
is
where
bully
bigg
the
donkey
let
her
slip
out
of
his
fingers
i
knew
he
was
a
fool
but
i
did
not
know
he
was
such
a
fool
said
the
dane
if
he
were
the
dane
i
will
not
pretend
to
write
down
the
oaths
and
foul
words
which
came
in
between
every
two
of
the
words
i
have
repeated
fool
yourself
replied
the
bully
and
what
sort
of
a
fool
is
the
man
who
comes
up
a
blind
alley
looking
after
a
girl
that
will
not
kiss
him
when
he
bids
her
anyway
put
in
another
of
the
crew
who
had
just
now
lifted
the
heavy
other
people
may
find
it
handy
to
hop
down
here
when
the
are
too
near
them
it
a
handy
place
to
know
of
in
a
dark
night
if
the
dear
deacons
do
choose
to
keep
it
open
for
a
poor
tramp
who
has
no
chance
at
the
house
here
lopp
you
are
the
tallest
jump
in
and
tell
us
what
is
there
and
at
this
moment
the
dane
caught
sight
of
my
unfortunate
ladder
lying
full
in
the
moonlight
i
could
see
him
seize
it
and
run
to
the
doorway
with
it
with
a
deep
laugh
and
some
phrase
of
his
own
country
talk
which
i
did
not
understand
the
deacons
are
very
good
said
the
savage
who
had
lifted
the
they
make
everything
handy
for
us
poor
fellows
and
though
he
had
not
planted
the
ladder
he
was
the
first
to
run
down
and
called
for
the
rest
to
follow
the
dane
was
second
lopp
was
third
and
the
bully
as
the
big
rascal
seemed
to
be
called
by
distinction
was
the
fourth
i
saw
him
disappear
from
my
view
with
a
mixture
of
wonder
and
terror
which
i
will
not
describe
i
seized
my
light
overcoat
which
always
hung
in
the
passage
i
flung
open
my
and
shut
it
again
behind
me
i
looked
into
the
black
of
the
cellar
to
see
the
reflections
from
their
distant
lanterns
and
without
a
sound
i
drew
up
my
ladder
then
i
ran
to
the
head
of
the
alley
and
sounded
my
rattle
as
i
would
have
sounded
the
trumpet
for
a
charge
in
battle
the
officers
joined
me
in
one
moment
i
am
the
man
who
spoke
to
the
captain
about
these
rowdies
four
of
them
are
in
the
cellar
of
the
church
yonder
now
do
you
know
who
one
they
called
lopp
and
one
they
called
bully
bigg
said
i
i
do
not
know
the
others
names
the
officers
were
enraptured
i
led
them
and
two
other
patrolmen
who
joined
us
to
the
shelter
of
my
in
a
few
minutes
the
head
of
the
dane
appeared
as
he
was
lifted
from
below
with
an
effort
and
three
or
four
oaths
he
struggled
out
upon
the
ground
to
be
seized
and
gagged
the
moment
he
stepped
back
with
varying
fortunes
bigg
and
lopp
emerged
and
were
seized
and
handcuffed
in
turn
the
fourth
surrendered
on
being
summoned
what
followed
comes
into
the
line
of
daily
life
and
the
morning
newspaper
so
regularly
that
i
need
not
describe
it
against
the
dane
it
proved
that
endless
warrants
could
be
brought
immediately
his
lair
of
stolen
baggage
and
other
property
was
unearthed
and
countless
sufferers
claimed
their
own
i
was
able
to
recover
frida
and
her
mother
possessions
the
locks
on
the
trunks
still
unbroken
the
dane
himself
would
have
been
sent
to
the
island
on
i
know
not
how
many
charges
but
that
the
danish
minister
asked
for
him
that
he
might
be
hanged
in
denmark
and
he
was
sent
and
hanged
accordingly
lopp
was
sent
to
for
ten
years
and
has
not
yet
been
pardoned
bigg
and
cordon
were
sent
to
blackwell
island
for
three
years
each
and
so
the
land
had
peace
for
that
time
that
winter
as
there
came
on
one
and
another
idle
alarm
that
frida
brother
might
be
heard
from
my
heart
sank
with
the
lowest
terror
lest
she
should
go
away
and
in
the
spring
i
told
her
that
if
she
went
away
i
was
sure
i
should
die
and
the
dear
girl
looked
down
and
looked
up
and
said
she
thought
she
thought
she
should
too
and
we
told
my
mother
that
we
had
determined
that
frida
should
never
go
away
while
we
stayed
there
and
she
approved
so
i
wrote
a
note
to
the
minister
of
the
church
which
had
protected
us
so
long
and
one
night
we
slid
the
board
carefully
and
all
three
walked
round
fearless
of
the
dane
and
frida
and
i
were
married
it
was
more
than
three
years
after
when
i
received
by
one
post
three
letters
which
gave
us
great
ground
for
consultation
the
first
was
from
my
old
friend
and
patron
the
spaniard
he
wrote
to
me
from
chicago
where
he
in
his
turn
had
fallen
in
with
a
crew
of
savages
who
had
stripped
him
of
all
he
had
under
the
pretext
of
a
they
engaged
him
in
and
had
left
him
without
a
real
as
he
said
he
wanted
to
know
if
i
could
not
find
him
some
clerkship
or
even
some
place
as
janitor
in
new
york
the
second
letter
was
from
old
henry
in
philadelphia
who
had
always
employed
me
after
my
old
master
death
he
said
that
the
fence
around
the
lot
in
avenue
might
need
some
repairs
and
he
wished
i
would
look
at
it
he
was
growing
old
he
said
and
he
did
not
care
to
come
to
new
york
but
the
fordyce
heirs
would
spend
ten
years
in
europe
the
third
letter
was
from
tom
grinnell
i
wrote
to
henry
that
i
thought
he
had
better
let
me
knock
up
a
little
office
where
a
keeper
might
sleep
if
necessary
that
there
was
some
stuff
with
which
i
could
put
up
such
an
office
and
that
i
had
an
old
friend
a
spaniard
who
was
an
honest
fellow
and
if
he
might
have
his
bed
in
the
office
would
take
gratefully
whatever
his
services
to
the
estate
proved
worth
he
wrote
me
by
the
next
day
mail
that
i
might
engage
the
spaniard
and
finish
the
office
so
i
wrote
to
the
spaniard
and
got
a
letter
from
him
accepting
the
post
provided
for
him
then
i
wrote
to
tom
grinnell
the
last
day
we
spent
at
our
dear
old
home
i
occupied
myself
in
finishing
the
office
as
friend
henry
bade
me
i
made
a
practicable
door
which
opened
from
the
passage
on
church
alley
then
i
loaded
my
with
my
own
chest
and
took
it
myself
in
my
working
clothes
to
the
vanderbilt
station
where
i
took
a
brass
check
for
it
i
could
not
wait
for
the
spaniard
but
i
left
a
letter
for
him
giving
him
a
description
of
the
way
i
managed
the
goats
and
directions
to
milk
and
fatten
them
and
to
make
both
butter
and
cheese
at
ten
a
crystal
as
those
cabs
were
then
called
came
to
the
corner
of
fernando
street
and
church
alley
and
so
we
drove
to
the
station
i
left
the
key
of
the
office
directed
to
the
spaniard
in
the
hands
of
the
when
i
took
leave
of
my
castle
as
i
called
it
i
carried
with
me
for
relics
the
great
straw
hat
i
had
made
my
umbrella
and
one
of
my
parrots
also
i
forgot
not
to
take
the
money
i
formerly
mentioned
which
had
lain
by
me
so
long
useless
that
it
was
grown
rusty
and
tarnished
and
could
scarcely
pass
for
money
till
it
had
been
a
little
rubbed
and
handled
with
these
relics
and
with
my
wife
and
mother
baggage
and
my
own
chest
we
arrived
at
our
new
home
bread
on
the
waters
a
washington
christmas
no
this
story
also
is
invented
example
but
it
is
founded
on
facts
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
writing
years
after
the
commission
intrusted
to
me
by
the
late
fales
to
say
that
that
is
a
real
name
and
that
her
benevolence
at
a
distance
is
precisely
represented
here
perhaps
the
large
history
of
the
world
would
be
differently
written
but
for
that
kindness
of
hers
i
was
a
very
young
clergyman
and
the
remittance
she
made
to
me
was
the
first
trust
of
the
same
kind
which
had
ever
been
confided
to
me
chapter
i
make
ready
only
think
matty
papa
passed
right
by
me
when
i
was
sitting
with
my
back
to
the
fire
and
stitching
away
on
his
without
my
once
seeing
him
but
he
was
so
busy
talking
to
mamma
that
he
never
saw
what
i
was
doing
and
i
huddled
it
under
a
newspaper
before
he
came
back
again
well
i
have
got
papa
present
done
but
i
can
not
keep
out
of
mamma
way
matty
dear
if
i
will
sit
in
the
sun
and
keep
a
shawl
on
may
i
not
sit
in
your
room
and
work
it
is
not
one
bit
cold
there
really
matty
it
is
a
great
deal
warmer
than
it
was
yesterday
dear
child
said
matty
to
whom
everybody
came
so
readily
for
advice
and
help
i
can
do
better
for
you
than
that
you
shall
come
into
the
study
papa
will
be
away
all
the
morning
and
i
will
have
the
fire
kept
up
there
and
mamma
shall
never
come
near
you
all
this
and
a
thousand
times
more
of
plotting
and
counterplotting
was
going
on
among
four
children
and
their
elders
in
a
comfortable
seeming
household
in
washington
as
the
boys
and
girls
young
men
and
young
women
were
in
the
last
agonies
of
making
ready
for
christmas
matty
is
fully
entitled
to
be
called
a
young
woman
when
we
see
her
she
has
just
passed
her
birthday
but
she
looks
as
fresh
and
pretty
as
when
she
was
seventeen
and
certainly
she
is
a
great
deal
pleasanter
though
she
be
wiser
she
is
the
oldest
of
the
troop
tom
the
next
is
expected
from
annapolis
this
afternoon
and
beverly
from
charlotte
then
come
four
boys
and
girls
whose
ages
and
places
the
reader
must
guess
at
as
we
go
on
the
youngest
of
the
family
were
still
young
enough
to
write
the
names
of
the
presents
which
they
would
be
glad
to
receive
or
to
denote
them
by
rude
hieroglyphs
on
large
sheets
of
paper
they
were
wont
to
pin
up
these
sheets
on
certain
doors
which
by
long
usage
in
this
family
had
come
to
be
regarded
as
the
of
the
establishment
every
range
of
created
things
had
some
representation
on
these
bulletins
from
an
ambling
pony
round
to
a
buttenner
thus
spelled
out
by
poor
laura
who
was
constantly
in
disgrace
because
she
always
appeared
latest
at
the
door
when
the
children
started
for
church
to
ride
or
for
school
the
youngsters
still
held
to
the
theory
of
announcing
thus
their
wants
in
advance
horace
doubted
whether
he
were
not
too
old
but
there
was
so
much
danger
that
nobody
would
know
how
much
he
needed
a
that
he
finally
compromised
with
his
dignity
wrote
on
a
virgin
sheet
of
paper
signed
his
name
horace
molyneux
and
left
his
other
presents
to
conjecture
and
of
course
at
the
very
end
as
santa
claus
and
his
revels
were
close
upon
them
while
the
work
done
had
been
wonderful
that
which
we
ought
to
have
done
but
which
we
had
left
undone
was
simply
terrible
here
were
pictures
that
must
be
brought
home
from
the
who
had
never
pretended
he
would
send
them
there
were
ferns
and
lycopodiums
in
pots
which
must
be
brought
home
from
the
greenhouse
here
were
presents
for
other
homes
which
must
not
only
be
finished
but
must
be
put
up
in
paper
and
sent
before
night
so
as
to
appear
on
other
trees
every
one
of
these
must
be
shown
to
mamma
an
approved
by
her
and
praised
and
every
one
must
be
shown
to
dear
matty
and
praised
and
approved
by
her
and
yet
by
no
accident
must
matty
see
her
own
presents
or
dream
that
any
child
has
remembered
her
or
mamma
see
hers
or
think
herself
remembered
and
matty
has
all
her
own
little
list
to
see
to
while
she
keeps
a
heart
at
leisure
from
itself
to
soothe
and
sympathize
she
has
to
correct
the
mistakes
to
repair
the
failures
to
respect
the
wonder
to
refresh
the
discouragement
of
each
and
all
the
youngsters
her
own
sunday
scholars
are
to
be
provided
with
their
presents
the
last
orders
are
to
be
given
for
the
christmas
dinners
of
families
of
vassals
mostly
black
or
of
some
shade
of
black
who
never
forgot
their
vassalage
as
christmas
came
round
turkey
cranberry
apples
tea
cheese
and
butter
must
be
sent
to
each
household
of
these
vassals
as
if
every
member
were
paralyzed
except
in
the
muscles
of
the
jaw
but
all
the
same
matty
or
her
mother
must
be
in
readiness
all
the
morning
and
afternoon
to
receive
the
visits
of
all
the
vassals
who
so
far
as
this
form
of
homage
went
did
not
seem
to
be
paralyzed
at
all
for
herself
matty
took
possession
of
the
room
as
soon
as
she
could
clear
it
of
the
breakfast
equipage
of
the
children
and
of
the
servants
and
here
with
pen
and
ink
with
and
twine
with
telegraph
blanks
and
with
the
directory
and
with
venty
as
her
ariel
messenger
not
so
airy
and
quick
as
ariel
but
quite
as
willing
matty
worked
her
wonders
and
gave
her
audiences
whether
to
vassals
from
without
or
puzzled
children
from
within
venty
was
short
for
ventidius
but
this
name
given
in
baptism
was
one
which
venty
seldom
heard
matty
corded
up
this
parcel
and
made
venty
cord
up
that
wrote
this
note
of
compliment
that
of
inquiry
that
of
congratulation
and
sent
venty
on
this
that
and
another
errand
with
them
relieved
flossy
anxieties
and
poor
laura
in
ways
which
have
been
described
made
sure
that
the
wagon
should
be
at
the
station
in
ample
time
for
beverly
arrival
and
at
last
at
nearly
one
called
aunty
chloe
who
was
in
waiting
on
everybody
as
a
superserviceable
person
on
the
pretence
that
she
was
needed
bade
aunty
pick
up
the
scraps
sweep
the
floor
and
bring
the
room
to
rights
and
so
having
attended
to
everybody
beside
herself
to
all
their
wishes
and
hopes
and
fears
poor
matty
or
shall
i
say
dear
matty
ran
off
to
her
own
room
to
finish
her
own
presents
and
make
her
own
last
preparations
she
had
kept
up
her
spirits
as
best
she
could
all
the
morning
but
at
any
moment
when
she
was
alone
her
spirits
had
fallen
again
she
knew
it
and
she
knew
why
and
now
she
could
not
hold
out
any
longer
she
and
her
mother
thank
god
never
had
any
secrets
and
as
she
ran
by
her
mother
door
she
could
not
help
tapping
to
be
sure
if
she
had
come
home
yes
she
had
come
home
come
in
and
matty
ran
in
her
mother
had
not
even
taken
off
her
hat
or
her
gloves
she
had
flung
herself
on
the
sofa
as
if
her
walk
had
been
quite
too
much
for
her
her
salts
and
her
handkerchief
were
in
her
hands
and
when
she
saw
it
was
matty
as
she
had
hoped
when
she
spoke
she
would
not
even
pretend
she
had
not
been
in
tears
in
a
moment
matty
was
on
her
knees
on
the
floor
by
the
sofa
and
somehow
had
her
left
arm
round
about
her
mother
neck
dear
dear
mamma
what
is
it
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
dear
matty
replied
her
mother
just
succeeding
in
speaking
without
sobs
and
speaking
the
more
easily
because
she
stroked
the
girl
hair
and
caressed
her
as
she
spoke
do
not
ask
do
not
try
to
know
you
will
know
if
you
do
not
guess
only
too
soon
and
now
the
children
will
be
better
and
papa
will
get
through
christmas
better
if
you
do
not
know
my
darling
no
dear
mamma
said
matty
crossing
her
purpose
almost
for
the
first
time
that
she
remembered
but
wholly
sure
that
she
was
right
in
doing
so
no
dear
mamma
it
is
not
best
so
indeed
it
is
not
mamma
i
feel
in
my
bones
that
it
is
not
this
she
said
with
a
wretched
attempt
to
smile
which
was
the
more
ghastly
because
the
tears
were
running
down
from
both
their
faces
you
see
i
have
tried
mamma
i
knew
all
day
yesterday
that
something
was
wrong
and
at
breakfast
this
morning
i
knew
it
and
i
have
had
to
hold
up
with
the
children
and
all
these
people
with
the
feeling
that
any
minute
the
hair
might
break
and
the
sword
fall
and
i
know
i
shall
do
better
if
you
tell
me
you
see
the
boys
will
be
here
before
dark
and
of
course
they
will
see
and
what
in
the
world
shall
i
say
to
them
what
indeed
said
her
poor
mother
terrible
it
is
dear
child
because
your
father
is
so
wretched
i
have
just
come
from
him
he
would
not
let
me
stay
and
yet
for
the
minute
i
was
there
i
saw
that
no
one
else
could
come
in
to
goad
him
dear
dear
papa
he
is
so
resolute
and
brave
and
yet
any
minute
i
was
afraid
that
he
would
break
a
and
fall
dead
before
me
oh
matty
matty
my
darling
it
is
terrible
and
this
time
the
poor
woman
could
not
control
herself
longer
but
gave
way
to
her
sobs
and
her
voice
fairly
broke
so
that
she
was
inarticulate
as
she
laid
her
cheek
against
her
daughter
on
the
sofa
what
is
terrible
dear
mamma
you
must
tell
me
i
think
i
must
tell
you
matty
my
darling
i
believe
if
i
can
not
tell
some
one
i
shall
die
then
molyneux
told
the
whole
horror
to
matty
here
was
her
husband
charged
with
the
grossest
plunder
of
the
treasury
and
now
charged
even
in
the
house
of
representatives
it
had
been
whispered
about
before
and
had
been
hinted
at
in
some
of
the
lower
newspapers
but
now
even
a
committee
of
congress
had
noticed
it
and
had
given
him
an
opportunity
to
clear
himself
there
was
no
less
a
sum
than
thousand
dollars
in
three
separate
payments
charged
to
him
at
the
navy
department
as
long
ago
as
the
second
and
third
years
of
the
civil
war
at
the
navy
they
had
his
receipts
for
it
not
that
he
had
been
in
that
department
then
any
more
than
he
was
now
he
was
then
chief
clerk
in
the
bureau
of
internal
improvement
as
he
was
now
commissioner
there
but
this
was
when
the
second
rio
grande
expedition
was
fitted
out
and
from
knowledge
of
spanish
and
his
old
connection
with
the
santa
fe
trade
this
particular
matter
had
been
intrusted
to
him
yes
dear
mamma
well
papa
has
it
all
down
on
his
own
cashbook
that
book
he
carries
in
his
there
are
the
three
payments
and
then
all
the
transfers
he
made
to
the
different
people
one
was
that
old
spaniard
with
the
harelip
who
used
to
come
here
at
the
back
door
so
that
he
should
not
be
seen
at
the
department
but
it
was
before
you
remember
the
others
were
in
smaller
sums
but
the
whole
thing
was
done
in
three
weeks
and
then
the
expedition
sailed
and
papa
had
enough
else
to
think
of
and
has
never
thought
of
it
since
till
ten
or
fifteen
days
ago
when
somebody
in
the
eleventh
auditor
office
discovered
this
charge
and
his
receipt
for
this
money
well
dear
mamma
well
dear
child
that
is
all
but
that
now
the
newspapers
have
got
hold
of
it
and
the
committee
on
retrenchment
who
are
all
new
men
with
their
reputations
to
make
have
got
hold
of
it
and
some
of
them
really
think
you
know
that
papa
has
stolen
the
money
and
she
broke
down
crying
again
but
he
can
show
his
accounts
mamma
what
are
his
accounts
worth
he
must
show
the
vouchers
as
they
are
called
he
must
show
these
people
receipts
and
what
has
become
of
these
people
what
they
did
with
the
money
he
must
show
everything
well
when
the
first
spoke
of
it
that
was
a
fortnight
ago
papa
was
really
pleased
for
he
said
it
would
be
a
good
chance
to
bring
out
a
piece
of
war
history
he
said
that
in
our
bureau
we
had
never
had
any
credit
for
the
rio
grande
successes
that
they
were
all
our
thunder
because
then
he
could
laugh
about
this
horrid
thing
he
said
the
navy
had
taken
all
the
boners
while
we
deserved
them
all
and
he
said
if
these
horrid
and
and
people
would
only
publish
the
vouchers
half
as
freely
as
they
published
the
charges
we
should
get
a
little
of
the
credit
that
was
our
due
well
mamma
and
what
is
the
trouble
now
why
papa
was
so
sure
that
he
would
do
nothing
until
an
official
call
came
but
on
monday
it
got
into
congress
that
hairy
man
from
the
yellowstone
brought
in
a
resolution
or
something
and
the
committee
was
ordered
to
inquire
and
when
the
order
came
down
papa
told
waltsingham
to
bring
him
the
papers
and
matty
the
papers
were
not
there
stolen
cried
matty
understanding
the
crisis
for
the
first
time
yes
perhaps
or
lost
hidden
somewhere
you
have
no
idea
of
the
work
of
those
days
night
work
and
all
that
many
a
time
your
father
did
not
undress
for
a
week
and
now
he
must
remember
where
he
put
a
horrid
pile
of
papers
eleven
twelve
years
ago
mamma
that
pile
is
stolen
that
odious
greenhithe
stole
it
he
lives
in
philadelphia
now
and
he
has
put
up
these
newspapers
to
this
lie
greenhithe
was
an
underclerk
in
the
internal
improvement
bureau
who
had
shown
an
amount
of
attention
to
miss
matty
which
she
had
disliked
and
had
refused
to
receive
she
had
always
said
he
was
bad
and
would
come
to
a
bad
end
and
when
he
was
detected
in
a
low
trick
selling
stationery
which
he
had
stolen
from
the
supply
room
and
was
discharged
in
disgrace
matty
had
said
it
was
good
enough
for
him
these
were
her
reasons
for
pronouncing
at
once
that
he
had
stolen
the
vouchers
and
had
started
the
rumors
i
do
not
know
papa
does
not
know
he
hardly
tries
to
guess
he
says
either
way
it
is
bad
if
the
vouchers
are
stolen
he
is
in
fault
for
he
is
responsible
for
the
archives
if
he
can
not
produce
the
vouchers
then
all
the
country
is
down
on
him
for
stealing
i
only
hope
said
poor
molyneux
that
they
wo
say
our
poor
old
wagon
is
a
coach
and
six
and
this
time
she
tried
to
smile
and
now
she
had
told
her
story
all
last
night
while
the
children
were
asleep
molyneux
had
been
at
the
office
even
till
four
in
the
morning
taking
old
dusty
piles
from
their
lairs
and
searching
for
those
wretched
vouchers
and
mamma
had
been
waiting
shall
one
not
say
had
been
weeping
here
at
home
that
was
the
reason
poor
papa
had
looked
so
haggard
at
breakfast
this
morning
this
was
all
mamma
had
to
tell
she
had
been
to
the
office
this
morning
but
papa
would
not
let
her
stay
he
must
see
all
comers
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
was
happening
or
was
going
to
happen
well
matty
did
make
her
mother
take
off
her
jacket
and
her
hat
and
her
gloves
she
even
made
her
drink
a
glass
of
wine
and
lie
down
and
then
the
poor
girl
retired
to
her
own
room
with
such
appetite
as
she
might
for
taking
the
last
stitches
in
worsted
work
for
stippling
in
the
lights
into
drawings
for
writing
the
presentation
lines
in
books
and
for
doing
the
thousand
little
niceties
in
the
way
of
finishing
touches
which
she
had
promised
the
children
to
do
for
them
her
dominant
feeling
yes
it
was
a
dominant
passion
as
she
knew
was
simply
rage
against
this
miserable
greenhithe
this
cowardly
sneak
who
was
thus
taking
his
revenge
upon
her
because
she
had
been
so
cold
to
him
or
was
it
that
he
made
up
to
her
because
he
was
already
in
trouble
at
the
office
and
hoped
she
would
clear
him
with
her
father
either
way
he
was
a
snake
and
a
scorpion
but
he
had
worked
out
for
himself
a
terrible
revenge
poor
matty
she
tried
to
think
what
she
could
do
how
she
could
help
for
that
was
the
habit
of
her
life
but
this
was
now
hard
indeed
her
mind
would
not
now
take
that
turn
all
that
it
would
turn
to
was
to
the
wretched
and
worse
than
worthless
question
what
punishment
might
fall
on
him
for
such
utter
baseness
and
wickedness
all
the
same
the
children
must
have
their
lunch
and
they
must
not
know
that
anything
was
the
matter
oh
dear
this
concealment
was
the
worst
of
all
so
they
had
their
lunch
and
poor
matty
counselled
again
and
helped
again
and
took
the
last
stitches
and
mended
the
last
breaks
and
waited
and
wondered
and
tried
to
hope
till
at
five
an
office
messenger
came
up
with
this
message
dear
matty
i
shall
not
come
up
to
dinner
there
is
pressing
work
here
tell
mamma
not
to
sit
up
for
me
i
have
my
key
i
have
no
chance
to
get
my
things
for
the
children
will
you
see
to
it
here
is
twenty
dollars
and
if
you
need
more
let
them
send
in
the
bill
i
had
only
thought
of
that
was
it
that
horace
wants
see
that
the
dear
fellow
has
a
good
one
love
to
all
and
ever
yours
papa
poor
dear
papa
said
matty
aloud
shedding
tears
in
spite
of
herself
to
be
thinking
of
and
children
in
all
this
horrid
hunt
as
if
hunting
for
anything
was
not
the
worst
trial
of
all
always
and
at
once
the
brave
girl
took
down
her
wraps
and
put
on
her
that
her
father
commissions
might
be
met
before
their
dinner
and
she
determined
that
first
of
all
she
would
meet
tom
at
the
station
at
the
station
she
met
tom
that
was
well
matty
had
not
been
charged
to
secrecy
that
was
well
she
told
him
all
the
story
not
without
adding
her
suspicions
and
giving
him
some
notion
of
her
rage
and
tom
was
angry
enough
there
was
a
crumb
of
comfort
there
but
tom
went
off
on
another
track
tom
distrusted
the
navy
department
he
had
been
long
enough
at
annapolis
to
doubt
the
red
tape
of
the
bureaus
with
which
his
chiefs
had
to
do
if
the
navy
had
the
money
the
navy
had
the
vouchers
that
was
tom
theory
he
knew
a
chief
clerk
in
the
navy
and
tom
was
going
at
once
round
there
but
matty
held
him
in
check
at
least
for
the
moment
whatever
else
he
did
he
must
come
home
first
he
must
see
mamma
and
he
must
see
the
children
and
he
must
have
dinner
she
had
not
told
him
yet
how
well
he
looked
and
how
handsome
he
was
but
after
tom
had
seen
them
he
slipped
off
pretended
he
had
unfinished
preparations
to
make
and
went
right
to
the
department
forced
his
way
in
because
he
was
molyneux
son
and
found
his
poor
father
with
zeigler
the
chief
clerk
still
on
this
wretched
and
fruitless
overhaul
of
the
old
files
tom
stated
frankly
in
his
way
what
his
theory
was
neither
zeigler
nor
tom
father
believed
in
it
in
the
least
tom
knew
nothing
they
said
the
navy
paid
the
money
but
the
navy
was
satisfied
with
our
receipt
and
should
be
tom
continued
to
say
if
the
navy
paid
the
money
the
navy
must
have
the
vouchers
and
at
last
more
to
be
rid
of
him
than
with
any
hope
of
the
result
molyneux
let
the
eager
fellow
go
round
to
his
friend
eben
ricketts
and
see
if
eben
would
not
give
an
hour
or
two
of
his
christmas
to
looking
up
the
thing
molyneux
even
went
so
far
as
to
write
a
frank
line
to
ricketts
and
enclosed
a
letter
which
he
had
had
that
day
from
the
chairman
of
the
house
committee
a
letter
which
was
smooth
enough
in
the
language
but
horrible
enough
in
the
thing
ah
me
had
not
ricketts
read
it
all
already
in
the
evening
argus
he
was
willing
if
he
could
to
serve
so
he
with
tom
went
round
and
found
the
navy
department
messenger
and
opened
and
lighted
up
the
necessary
rooms
and
they
spent
three
hours
of
their
christmas
there
meanwhile
beverly
had
arrived
from
norfolk
he
had
a
frolic
with
the
children
and
then
called
his
mother
and
matty
away
from
them
what
in
thunder
is
the
matter
said
the
poor
boy
and
they
told
him
how
could
they
help
telling
him
and
so
soon
as
the
story
was
finished
the
boy
had
his
coat
on
and
was
putting
on
his
boots
he
went
right
down
to
his
father
office
he
made
old
stratton
admit
him
and
told
his
father
he
too
had
reported
for
duty
chapter
ii
christmas
morning
and
at
last
christmas
morning
dawned
gray
enough
and
grim
enough
in
that
house
the
general
presenting
was
reserved
for
evening
after
dinner
when
in
olden
days
there
had
always
been
a
large
lighted
and
dressed
for
the
children
and
their
little
friends
as
the
children
had
grown
older
and
the
trees
at
the
and
elsewhere
had
grown
larger
the
family
tree
had
grown
smaller
and
on
this
day
was
to
be
simply
atypical
tree
a
little
suggestion
of
a
tree
between
the
front
windows
while
most
of
the
presents
of
every
sort
and
kind
were
to
be
dispersed
where
room
could
be
made
for
them
in
any
part
of
the
front
parlors
all
the
grand
ceremonial
of
was
thus
reserved
to
the
afternoon
of
christmas
because
then
it
was
certain
papa
would
be
at
home
tom
and
beverly
would
both
be
ready
and
indeed
as
the
little
people
confessed
they
themselves
would
have
more
chance
to
be
quite
prepared
but
none
the
less
was
the
myth
of
santa
claus
and
the
stockings
kept
up
although
that
was
a
business
of
less
account
and
one
in
which
the
children
themselves
had
no
share
except
to
wonder
to
enjoy
and
to
receive
you
will
observe
that
there
is
a
duality
in
most
of
the
enjoyments
of
life
that
if
you
have
a
letter
from
your
brother
who
is
in
yokohama
by
the
same
mail
or
the
next
mail
there
comes
a
letter
from
your
sister
who
is
in
cawnpore
and
so
it
was
of
christmas
at
this
molyneux
house
besides
the
great
wonders
like
those
wrought
out
by
aladdin
slave
of
the
lamp
there
were
the
wonders
less
gigantic
but
not
less
exquisite
of
the
morning
hours
wrought
out
by
the
slave
of
the
ring
how
this
series
of
wonders
came
about
the
youngest
of
the
children
did
not
know
and
were
still
imaginative
enough
and
truly
wise
enough
not
to
inquire
while
then
the
two
young
men
and
their
father
were
at
one
or
the
other
department
now
on
handing
down
dusty
old
pasteboard
boxes
now
under
gaslights
running
down
long
indexes
with
inquiring
fingers
and
unwinking
eyes
matty
and
her
mother
watched
and
waited
till
eleven
came
not
saying
much
of
what
was
on
the
hearts
of
both
but
sometimes
just
recurring
to
it
as
by
some
invisible
influence
an
influence
which
would
overcome
both
of
them
at
the
same
moment
for
the
mother
and
daughter
were
as
two
sisters
not
parted
far
even
in
age
and
not
parted
at
all
in
sympathy
for
occupation
they
were
wrapping
up
in
thin
paper
a
hundred
barley
dogs
cats
eagles
locomotives
suns
moons
and
stars
with
little
parcels
of
nuts
raisins
and
figs
large
red
apples
and
bright
florida
oranges
all
of
which
were
destined
to
be
dragged
out
of
different
stockings
at
daybreak
and
now
dear
dear
mamma
said
matty
you
will
go
to
bed
please
do
dear
mamma
this
was
said
as
she
compelled
the
last
obstinate
eagle
to
accept
his
fate
and
stay
in
his
from
which
he
had
more
than
once
struggled
out
with
the
instincts
of
freedom
please
do
dear
mamma
i
will
sort
these
all
out
and
will
be
quite
sure
that
each
has
his
own
at
least
let
us
come
upstairs
together
i
will
comb
your
hair
for
you
that
is
one
of
the
little
comforts
and
you
shall
get
into
bed
and
see
me
arrange
them
and
if
i
do
it
wrong
you
can
tell
me
poor
mamma
she
yielded
to
her
as
who
does
not
yield
and
because
it
was
easier
to
go
upstairs
than
to
stay
and
the
girl
led
her
up
and
made
herself
a
toilet
woman
indeed
and
did
put
her
mamma
into
bed
and
then
hurried
to
the
laundry
where
she
was
sure
she
could
find
what
diana
had
been
bidden
to
reserve
there
a
pair
of
clean
stockings
belonging
to
each
member
of
the
family
the
youngest
children
alas
who
would
need
the
most
room
for
their
and
sugar
locomotives
had
the
smallest
feet
and
legs
but
nature
compensates
for
all
things
and
matty
did
not
fail
to
provide
an
extra
pair
of
her
mother
longest
stockings
for
each
of
the
three
as
the
youngest
were
called
in
the
councils
of
their
elders
so
a
name
was
printed
by
santa
claus
on
a
large
red
card
and
pinned
upon
each
receptacle
flossy
or
laura
while
all
were
willing
to
accept
of
his
bounties
contained
within
even
if
they
did
not
recognize
yarn
or
knitting
as
familiar
matty
hurried
back
with
their
treasures
she
brought
from
her
own
room
the
large
red
tickets
already
prepared
and
then
on
the
floor
by
her
mother
bedside
assorted
the
innumerable
parcels
and
filled
each
stocking
full
dear
girl
she
had
not
wrongly
guessed
there
was
just
occupation
enough
and
just
little
enough
for
the
poor
mother
anxious
tired
thought
matty
was
wise
she
asked
fewer
and
fewer
questions
fewer
and
fewer
she
made
her
journeys
to
the
great
high
fender
where
she
pinned
all
these
stiff
models
of
gouty
legs
and
when
the
last
hung
there
quietly
the
girl
had
the
exquisite
satisfaction
of
seeing
that
her
mother
was
fast
asleep
she
would
not
leave
the
room
she
turned
the
down
to
a
tiny
bead
she
slipped
off
her
own
frock
put
on
her
mother
heavy
lay
down
quietly
by
her
side
without
rousing
her
and
in
a
little
while
for
with
those
so
young
this
resource
is
sure
she
slept
too
it
was
five
when
she
was
wakened
by
her
father
hand
he
led
her
out
into
his
own
room
and
before
she
spoke
she
kissed
him
she
knew
what
his
answer
would
be
she
knew
that
from
his
heavy
face
but
all
the
same
she
tried
to
smile
and
she
said
found
found
no
no
dear
child
nor
ever
will
be
how
is
mamma
and
matty
told
him
and
begged
him
to
come
and
sleep
in
her
own
little
room
because
the
children
would
come
in
in
a
rout
at
daybreak
but
no
he
would
not
hear
to
that
whatever
else
is
left
dear
matty
we
have
each
other
and
we
will
not
begin
on
what
will
be
a
new
life
to
all
of
us
we
will
not
begin
by
a
jot
of
the
dear
children
joys
matty
that
is
what
i
have
been
thinking
of
all
the
way
as
i
walked
home
but
maybe
i
should
not
have
said
it
but
that
beverly
said
it
just
now
to
me
dear
fellow
i
can
not
tell
you
the
comfort
it
was
to
me
to
see
him
come
in
i
told
him
he
should
not
have
come
but
he
knew
that
he
made
me
almost
happy
he
is
a
fine
fellow
matty
and
all
night
long
he
has
shown
the
temper
and
the
sense
of
a
man
for
a
moment
matty
could
not
say
a
word
her
eyes
were
all
running
over
with
tears
she
kissed
her
father
again
and
then
found
out
how
to
say
i
shall
tell
him
what
you
say
papa
and
there
will
be
two
happy
children
in
this
house
after
all
so
she
ran
to
beverly
room
found
him
before
he
was
undressed
and
told
him
and
the
boy
who
was
just
becoming
a
man
and
the
girl
who
without
knowing
it
had
become
a
woman
kissed
each
other
held
each
other
for
a
minute
each
by
both
hands
looked
each
other
so
lovingly
in
the
eyes
comforted
each
other
by
the
infinite
comfort
of
love
and
then
said
and
were
asleep
tom
had
stolen
to
bed
without
waking
his
mother
or
his
sister
some
hours
before
yes
they
all
slept
the
little
ones
slept
though
they
had
been
so
certain
that
they
should
not
sleep
one
wink
from
anxiety
this
poor
jaded
man
slept
because
he
must
sleep
his
poor
wife
slept
because
she
had
not
slept
now
for
two
nights
before
and
matty
and
tom
and
beverly
slept
because
they
were
young
and
brave
and
certain
and
pure
and
because
they
were
between
seventeen
and
years
of
age
this
is
all
to
say
that
they
could
seek
god
help
and
find
it
this
is
to
say
that
they
were
omnipotent
over
earthly
ills
so
far
at
the
least
that
sleep
came
when
sleep
was
needed
but
not
after
seven
venty
and
diana
had
been
retained
by
flossy
and
laura
to
call
them
at
five
minutes
of
seven
and
laura
and
flossy
had
called
the
others
and
at
seven
precisely
a
sounded
in
the
children
quarters
and
then
four
grotesque
riders
each
with
a
soldier
hat
made
of
newspaper
each
with
a
bright
sash
girt
round
a
gown
each
with
bare
feet
stuck
into
stout
shoes
came
storming
down
the
stairs
and
as
soon
as
the
lower
floor
was
reached
each
mounted
on
a
or
stick
and
with
riot
not
to
be
told
came
knocking
at
matty
door
at
beverly
and
at
tom
and
these
all
appeared
also
with
paper
soldier
hats
upon
their
heads
and
girt
in
some
very
spontaneous
costume
and
so
the
whole
troop
proceeded
with
loud
fanfaron
and
drumbeat
to
mamma
door
and
knocked
for
admission
and
heard
her
cheery
come
in
and
papa
and
mamma
had
heard
the
and
had
wrapped
some
sort
of
shawls
around
their
shoulders
and
were
sitting
up
in
bed
they
also
with
paper
soldier
hats
upon
them
and
one
scream
of
merry
christmas
resounded
as
the
doors
flew
open
and
then
a
wild
rampage
of
kissing
and
of
hugging
as
the
little
ones
rushed
for
the
best
places
they
could
find
on
the
bed
not
to
say
in
it
this
was
the
christmas
custom
and
tom
rolled
up
a
lounge
on
one
side
of
the
bed
which
after
a
fashion
widened
it
and
beverly
brought
up
his
mother
which
had
earned
the
name
of
moses
seat
on
the
other
side
and
thus
in
a
minute
the
great
broad
bed
was
peopled
with
the
whole
family
as
jolly
if
as
absurd
a
sight
as
the
rising
sun
looked
upon
and
then
flossy
and
beverly
were
deputed
to
go
to
the
fender
and
to
bring
the
crowded
stiff
stockings
whose
crackle
was
so
delicate
and
exquisite
and
so
youngest
by
youngest
they
brought
forth
their
treasures
not
indeed
gold
frankincense
and
myrrh
but
what
answered
the
immediate
purposes
better
barley
cats
dogs
elephants
and
locomotives
figs
raisins
walnuts
and
pecans
yes
and
for
one
noisy
not
one
person
thought
of
the
cloud
which
hung
over
the
house
only
the
night
before
but
such
happy
forgetfulness
can
not
last
forever
there
was
the
christmas
breakfast
and
tom
tried
to
tell
of
academy
times
and
beverly
tried
to
tell
stories
of
the
university
but
it
was
a
hard
pull
the
lines
under
papa
eyes
were
only
too
dark
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
would
start
and
ask
some
question
which
showed
that
he
did
not
know
what
they
were
talking
of
matty
had
taken
care
to
have
the
newspapers
out
of
the
way
but
everybody
knew
why
they
were
out
of
the
way
and
perhaps
this
made
things
worse
poor
blundering
laura
must
needs
say
that
is
the
good
of
christmas
that
there
are
no
horrid
newspapers
for
people
to
bother
with
when
everybody
above
horace
age
knew
that
there
were
papers
somewhere
and
soon
horace
was
bright
enough
to
see
what
he
had
not
been
told
in
words
that
something
was
going
wrong
and
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
done
flossy
cried
out
and
now
papa
will
tell
us
the
story
of
the
bear
papa
always
tells
us
that
on
christmas
morning
laura
you
shall
come
and
horace
you
shall
sit
there
and
then
her
poor
papa
had
to
take
her
up
and
kiss
her
and
say
that
this
morning
he
could
not
stop
to
tell
stories
that
he
had
to
go
to
the
department
and
then
flossy
and
laura
fairly
cried
it
was
too
bad
they
hated
the
department
there
never
could
be
any
fun
but
what
that
horrid
old
department
came
in
and
when
horace
found
that
tom
was
going
to
the
department
too
and
that
bev
meant
to
go
with
him
he
was
mad
and
said
he
did
not
see
what
was
the
use
of
having
christmas
here
he
had
foil
and
plaster
upstairs
and
little
watrous
had
lent
him
a
set
of
government
medals
and
they
should
have
such
a
real
good
time
if
bev
would
only
stay
he
wished
the
department
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
potomac
matty
fairly
had
to
take
the
scolding
boy
out
of
the
room
molyneux
poor
fellow
undertook
the
soothing
of
flossy
anyway
old
girl
you
shall
meet
me
as
you
go
to
church
and
we
will
go
through
the
avenue
together
and
i
will
show
you
the
new
topsy
girl
selling
cigars
at
pierre
tobacco
shop
she
is
as
big
as
flossy
she
has
not
got
quite
such
golden
hair
but
she
never
says
one
word
to
her
papa
because
she
is
never
cross
to
him
that
because
he
is
never
kind
to
her
said
the
quick
child
speaking
wiser
than
she
knew
for
matty
she
got
a
word
with
tom
and
he
too
promised
that
they
would
be
away
from
the
department
in
time
to
meet
the
home
party
and
that
all
of
them
should
go
to
church
together
chapter
iii
church
and
sermon
and
accordingly
as
molyneux
with
her
little
troop
crossed
f
street
they
met
the
gentlemen
all
coming
toward
them
they
broke
up
into
groups
and
tom
and
matty
got
their
first
real
chance
for
talk
since
they
had
parted
the
night
before
no
tom
had
found
no
clue
at
the
navy
department
and
although
eben
ricketts
had
been
good
as
gold
and
had
stayed
and
worked
with
tom
till
long
after
midnight
eben
had
only
worked
to
show
for
eben
had
not
the
least
faith
that
there
was
any
clue
there
eben
had
said
that
if
old
whilthaugh
who
knew
the
archive
rooms
through
and
through
had
not
been
turned
out
they
could
do
in
fifteen
minutes
what
had
cost
them
six
hours
and
that
old
whilthaugh
without
looking
could
tell
whether
it
was
worth
while
to
look
but
old
whilthaugh
had
been
turned
out
and
eben
even
did
not
know
precisely
what
had
become
of
him
he
thought
he
had
gone
back
into
pennsylvania
where
his
wife
came
from
but
he
did
not
know
but
matty
if
nothing
turns
up
i
go
to
pennsylvania
to
find
this
old
whilthaugh
for
i
shall
die
if
i
stay
here
and
all
the
eben
rickettses
in
the
world
will
never
persuade
me
that
the
vouchers
are
not
in
that
if
the
navy
did
the
work
the
navy
must
have
the
vouchers
then
matty
ventured
to
ask
what
she
and
her
mother
had
wondered
about
once
and
again
why
these
particular
bits
of
paper
were
so
necessary
surely
other
vouchers
or
certified
copies
or
books
of
account
could
be
found
somewhere
yes
i
know
you
would
say
so
and
if
it
were
all
yesterday
and
was
all
in
these
lazy
times
of
peace
you
would
say
true
but
you
see
in
the
first
place
this
is
ever
so
long
ago
then
in
the
second
place
it
was
in
the
heat
of
war
when
everything
was
on
a
gigantic
scale
and
things
had
to
be
done
in
ways
then
chiefly
this
particular
business
involved
the
buying
up
of
i
do
not
know
who
among
the
rebels
there
in
texas
and
among
their
allies
on
the
other
side
the
rio
grande
this
old
spaniard
whom
mamma
remembers
and
whom
i
just
remember
he
was
the
chief
captain
among
the
turncoats
and
there
were
two
or
three
others
men
in
their
places
first
family
men
that
means
you
know
but
after
they
did
this
work
they
did
not
stay
in
their
places
long
no
papa
says
he
was
mighty
careful
that
he
had
three
of
the
scoundrels
sworn
before
notaries
or
rather
before
one
notary
and
had
their
receipts
and
acknowledgments
stamped
with
his
seal
still
it
did
not
do
to
have
a
word
said
in
public
then
and
after
everything
succeeded
so
perfectly
after
the
troops
landed
without
a
shot
and
found
all
the
base
ready
for
them
corn
and
pork
just
where
they
wanted
it
why
then
everybody
was
too
gratified
to
think
of
imagining
as
they
do
now
that
papa
had
stolen
that
money
that
bought
the
pork
and
the
corn
i
wish
they
were
only
half
as
grateful
now
he
said
after
a
pause
tom
said
matty
eagerly
who
was
that
notary
i
thought
of
that
too
said
tom
there
is
no
doubt
who
it
was
it
was
old
gilbert
you
must
remember
his
sign
just
below
faulkner
on
the
avenue
but
in
the
first
place
gilbert
died
just
after
our
taking
richmond
in
the
second
place
he
never
knew
what
the
papers
were
and
he
executed
twenty
such
sets
of
papers
every
day
very
likely
all
he
could
say
at
the
very
best
would
be
that
at
such
a
time
father
brought
in
an
old
spaniard
and
two
or
three
other
greasers
and
that
he
took
their
acknowledgments
of
something
i
do
not
know
that
tom
said
the
girl
without
flinching
at
his
mannish
information
if
notaries
in
washington
are
anything
like
notaries
in
novels
that
man
kept
a
record
or
register
of
his
work
if
he
was
not
very
unlike
everybody
else
who
lives
and
works
here
he
left
a
very
destitute
widow
when
he
died
tom
i
shall
go
after
church
and
hunt
up
the
widow
gilbert
i
shall
ask
her
for
her
husband
books
and
shall
tell
her
why
i
want
them
the
girl
dropped
her
voice
and
said
tom
i
shall
ask
her
in
his
name
god
grant
it
does
any
good
dear
girl
said
he
far
be
it
from
me
to
say
that
you
shall
not
try
but
here
he
stopped
speaking
for
he
felt
matty
arm
shake
in
his
and
her
whole
frame
trembled
tom
had
only
to
keep
his
eyes
before
him
to
see
why
greenhithe
matty
old
admirer
the
clerk
who
had
been
dismissed
for
stealing
was
just
entering
the
church
and
even
touched
his
hat
to
her
as
she
went
by
tom
resisted
his
temptation
to
thrash
him
then
and
there
he
said
matty
i
believe
i
will
tackle
that
man
oh
tom
yes
matty
i
can
keep
my
temper
and
he
can
not
keep
his
he
has
one
advantage
over
most
knaves
that
he
is
not
only
a
knave
of
the
first
water
but
he
is
sometimes
a
fool
too
if
it
were
only
decent
and
right
to
take
him
into
downing
saloon
and
give
him
just
one
more
glass
of
whiskey
than
the
blackguard
would
care
to
pay
for
i
could
get
at
his
whole
story
but
tom
i
thought
you
were
so
sure
the
navy
had
the
papers
well
well
said
tom
a
little
annoyed
as
eager
people
are
when
other
eager
people
remember
their
words
against
them
i
was
sure
i
was
wholly
sure
till
i
left
eben
ricketts
but
after
that
well
of
course
we
ought
to
pull
every
string
tom
this
with
a
terrible
gulp
tom
you
do
think
i
ought
to
speak
with
him
matty
why
tom
yes
if
he
does
know
if
he
is
holding
this
up
in
terror
tom
i
could
make
him
do
what
i
chose
once
tom
you
do
think
i
ought
to
try
matty
if
you
ever
speak
to
that
snake
again
i
will
thrash
him
within
an
inch
of
his
life
and
i
will
never
say
a
word
to
you
as
long
as
you
live
that
my
dear
tom
and
hidden
as
they
were
and
crying
as
she
was
under
her
veil
she
flung
her
arms
around
him
and
kissed
him
all
the
same
said
tom
after
he
had
kissed
her
again
and
again
all
the
same
i
shall
find
out
after
church
where
the
snake
is
staying
i
shall
go
to
the
hotel
and
take
a
cigar
i
shall
offer
him
one
and
he
is
so
mean
and
stingy
that
he
will
take
it
perhaps
this
may
be
one
of
his
fool
days
perhaps
somebody
else
will
treat
him
to
the
whiskey
no
matty
honor
bright
will
not
though
that
ten
cents
might
give
us
all
a
merry
christmas
honor
bright
i
will
not
treat
but
i
am
not
a
saint
matty
if
anybody
else
treats
i
must
not
be
expected
to
be
far
away
then
he
wiped
her
eyes
with
his
own
handkerchief
and
led
her
in
to
the
service
their
own
pew
was
already
full
he
had
to
take
her
back
into
metcalf
pew
so
matty
was
spared
one
annoyance
which
was
prepared
for
her
directly
in
front
of
her
father
pew
sitting
in
the
most
conspicuous
seat
on
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
was
the
hateful
greenhithe
had
he
put
himself
there
to
watch
matty
face
if
he
did
he
was
disappointed
if
he
had
persuaded
himself
he
was
to
see
a
pale
cheek
or
tearful
eyes
or
that
he
was
going
to
compel
her
to
drop
her
veil
he
had
reckoned
quite
without
his
host
whenever
he
did
look
that
way
all
he
saw
was
the
face
of
master
horace
horace
was
engaged
in
counting
the
large
tassels
on
his
side
of
the
pulpit
curtains
in
counting
also
the
number
of
small
tassels
between
them
and
from
the
data
thus
obtained
in
calculating
how
many
tassels
there
must
be
on
all
the
curtains
to
the
pulpit
and
how
many
on
the
curtains
behind
the
rail
to
the
chancel
greenhithe
therefore
had
but
little
comfort
in
studying
horace
face
just
as
the
creed
was
finished
when
the
rest
of
the
church
was
still
the
sexton
led
up
the
aisle
a
looking
man
with
a
shaggy
coat
and
a
very
dirty
face
and
brought
him
close
to
the
door
of
molyneux
pew
as
if
he
would
fain
bring
him
in
molyneux
was
at
the
end
of
the
pew
but
happened
to
be
turning
away
from
the
aisle
and
the
sexton
actually
touched
him
he
turned
round
and
looked
at
the
stranger
evidently
did
not
know
him
but
with
the
instinct
of
hospitality
stepped
into
the
aisle
and
offered
him
his
seat
the
stranger
was
embarrassed
hesitated
as
if
he
would
speak
then
shook
his
head
in
refusal
of
the
attention
and
crossing
the
aisle
took
a
seat
offered
him
there
in
full
sight
of
molyneux
and
indeed
of
matty
poor
girl
the
trifle
of
course
it
was
a
trifle
upset
her
sadly
was
the
man
a
marshal
or
a
sheriff
would
they
really
arrest
her
father
on
christmas
day
in
church
chapter
iv
is
this
christmas
yes
it
was
as
you
have
said
a
very
curious
christmas
service
for
all
those
people
what
horace
turned
his
mind
to
at
intervals
has
been
told
of
the
elder
members
of
our
little
company
who
sat
there
near
the
head
of
the
side
aisle
it
may
be
said
in
general
that
they
did
their
best
to
keep
their
hearts
and
minds
engaged
in
the
service
and
that
sometimes
they
succeeded
they
succeeded
better
while
they
could
really
join
in
the
hymns
and
the
prayers
than
they
did
when
it
came
to
the
sermon
good
gill
overruled
by
one
of
those
lesser
demons
whose
work
is
so
apparent
though
so
inexplicable
in
this
finite
world
had
selected
for
the
text
of
his
sermon
of
gladness
the
words
search
and
look
and
so
it
happened
it
was
what
did
not
often
happen
with
him
he
must
needs
repeat
those
words
often
at
the
beginning
and
end
indeed
of
every
leading
paragraph
of
the
sermon
now
this
duty
of
searching
and
looking
had
been
just
what
all
the
elder
members
of
the
molyneux
family
had
been
solidly
doing
each
in
his
way
or
hers
directly
or
by
sympathy
in
the
last
eight
hours
to
get
such
relief
as
they
might
from
it
they
had
come
to
church
to
look
rather
higher
if
they
could
so
that
it
was
to
them
more
a
misfortune
than
a
matter
of
immediate
spiritual
relief
that
their
dear
old
friend
who
loved
each
one
of
them
with
an
intimate
and
peculiar
love
happened
to
enlarge
on
his
text
just
as
he
did
if
poor
molyneux
by
dint
of
severe
had
succeeded
in
abstracting
his
thoughts
from
disgrace
almost
certain
from
thinking
over
in
horrible
variety
the
several
threads
of
inquiry
and
answer
by
which
that
disgrace
was
to
be
avoided
or
precipitated
how
was
it
possible
to
maintain
such
abstraction
while
the
worthy
preacher
wholly
unconscious
of
the
blood
he
drew
with
every
word
ground
out
his
sentences
in
such
words
as
these
search
and
look
my
brethren
time
passes
faster
than
we
think
our
gray
hairs
gather
apace
above
our
foreheads
and
the
treasure
which
we
prized
beyond
price
in
years
bygone
has
perhaps
amid
the
cares
of
this
world
or
in
the
deceitfulness
of
riches
been
thrust
on
one
side
neglected
at
last
forgotten
how
is
it
with
you
dear
friends
are
you
the
man
are
you
the
woman
have
you
put
on
one
side
the
very
treasure
of
your
life
as
some
careless
housewife
might
lay
aside
on
a
forgotten
shelf
this
parcel
or
that
once
so
precious
to
her
dear
friends
as
the
year
draws
to
a
close
awaken
from
such
neglect
brush
away
the
dust
from
these
forgotten
caskets
lift
them
from
their
and
set
them
forth
even
in
your
christmas
festivities
search
and
look
poor
molyneux
had
never
wished
before
so
earnestly
that
a
sermon
might
be
done
she
dared
not
look
round
to
see
her
husband
for
a
while
but
after
one
of
these
invocations
not
quite
so
terrible
as
the
rest
perhaps
she
stole
a
glance
that
way
to
find
that
she
might
have
spared
her
anxiety
two
nights
of
searching
and
looking
had
done
their
duty
by
the
poor
man
and
though
his
head
was
firm
braced
against
the
column
which
rose
from
the
side
of
their
pew
his
eyes
were
closed
and
his
wife
was
relieved
by
the
certainty
that
he
was
listening
as
those
happy
members
of
the
human
family
listen
who
assure
me
that
they
hear
when
their
lids
are
tight
pressed
over
their
eyeballs
as
for
beverly
he
was
assuming
the
resolute
aspect
of
a
sailor
under
fire
and
was
imagining
himself
taking
the
whole
storm
of
fort
constantine
as
he
led
an
american
squadron
into
the
bay
of
sevastopol
tom
did
not
know
what
the
preacher
said
but
was
devising
the
method
of
his
interview
with
greenhithe
matty
did
know
dear
girl
she
knew
very
well
and
with
every
sentence
of
the
sermon
she
was
more
determined
as
to
the
method
of
her
appeal
to
gilbert
the
widow
of
the
notary
she
would
search
and
look
there
yes
and
it
was
well
for
every
one
of
them
that
they
went
to
that
service
the
sermon
at
the
worst
was
but
twenty
minutes
twenty
minutes
in
length
said
beverly
wickedly
and
no
depth
at
all
but
that
was
not
true
nor
fair
nor
was
that
either
way
the
thing
that
was
essential
by
the
time
they
had
all
sung
praise
god
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
even
before
the
good
old
doctor
had
asked
for
blessing
upon
them
it
had
come
to
molyneux
it
had
come
in
an
hour
rest
of
mind
body
and
soul
to
matty
it
had
come
in
an
hour
calm
determination
to
molyneux
it
had
come
in
the
certainty
that
there
is
one
eye
which
sees
through
all
and
behind
all
disguises
to
the
children
it
had
come
because
the
hour
had
called
up
to
them
a
hundred
memories
of
galilee
and
nazareth
of
mary
mother
and
of
children
made
happy
to
supplement
and
help
out
their
legends
of
santa
claus
yes
and
even
beverly
the
brave
and
tom
the
outraged
as
they
stood
to
receive
the
benediction
of
the
preacher
were
more
of
men
and
less
of
firebrands
than
they
were
they
all
stood
with
reverence
they
paused
a
moment
and
then
slowly
walked
down
the
aisle
where
is
your
father
horace
said
molyneux
a
little
anxiously
as
she
came
where
she
could
speak
aloud
horace
was
waiting
for
her
papa
he
went
away
with
the
gentleman
who
came
in
after
service
began
they
crossed
the
street
and
took
a
carriage
together
and
did
papa
leave
no
message
why
no
he
did
not
turn
round
the
strange
man
the
man
in
the
rough
coat
just
touched
him
and
spoke
to
him
down
the
aisle
then
papa
whispered
to
him
and
he
whispered
back
then
as
soon
as
they
came
into
the
vestibule
here
papa
led
him
out
at
that
side
door
and
did
not
seem
to
remember
me
they
almost
ran
across
the
street
and
took
george
gibb
hack
i
knew
the
horses
that
too
bad
said
laura
i
thought
papa
would
walk
home
with
us
and
tell
us
the
story
of
the
bears
poor
molyneux
thought
it
was
too
bad
too
but
she
said
nothing
and
matty
when
she
joined
her
mother
said
i
shall
feel
a
thousand
times
happier
mamma
if
i
go
and
see
gilbert
now
and
she
explained
who
gilbert
was
perhaps
it
may
do
some
good
anyway
i
shall
feel
as
if
i
were
doing
something
i
will
be
home
in
time
to
finish
the
tree
and
things
for
horace
will
like
to
help
me
and
the
poor
girl
looked
her
entreaties
so
eagerly
that
her
mother
could
not
but
assent
to
her
plan
so
she
made
beverly
go
up
the
avenue
with
her
beverly
who
would
have
swum
the
potomac
and
back
for
her
had
she
asked
him
as
he
was
on
his
way
to
join
his
father
at
the
bureau
as
they
came
out
upon
the
broad
sidewalk
that
odious
greenhithe
with
some
one
whom
beverly
called
a
blackguard
of
his
crew
pushed
by
them
and
he
had
the
impudence
to
turn
and
touch
his
hat
to
matty
again
matty
hand
trembled
on
beverly
arm
but
she
would
not
speak
for
a
minute
only
she
walked
slower
and
slower
then
she
said
i
am
so
afraid
bev
that
tom
and
he
will
get
into
a
quarrel
tom
declares
he
will
go
into
willard
and
find
out
whether
he
does
know
anything
but
beverly
very
mannish
tried
to
reassure
her
and
make
her
believe
that
tom
would
be
very
and
perfectly
careful
on
christmas
day
the
jew
store
which
had
taken
the
place
of
old
gilbert
notary
office
was
closed
not
perhaps
so
much
from
the
enthusiasm
about
christmas
as
in
deference
to
what
in
new
england
is
called
the
sense
of
the
street
matty
however
acting
from
a
precise
knowledge
of
washington
life
rang
boldly
at
the
green
door
adjacent
beverly
still
waiting
to
see
what
might
turn
up
and
when
a
brisk
colored
girl
appeared
matty
inquired
if
munroe
was
at
home
now
all
that
matty
knew
of
munroe
was
that
her
name
was
on
a
brass
plate
on
the
door
munroe
was
in
beverly
said
he
would
wait
in
the
passage
munroe
proved
to
be
a
nice
motherly
sort
of
a
person
who
as
it
need
hardly
be
said
was
it
required
some
time
for
matty
to
adjust
her
speaking
apparatus
to
the
exigency
but
when
this
was
done
munroe
explained
that
gilbert
was
dead
that
an
effort
had
been
made
to
continue
the
business
with
the
old
sign
and
the
old
good
will
under
the
direction
of
a
certain
bundy
who
had
sometimes
been
called
in
as
an
assistant
but
bundy
after
some
years
paid
more
attention
to
whiskey
than
he
did
to
notarying
and
the
law
business
had
suffered
finally
bundy
was
brought
home
by
the
police
one
night
with
a
broken
head
and
then
gilbert
had
withdrawn
the
signs
cancelled
the
lease
turned
bundy
doors
and
retired
to
live
with
a
of
her
brother
wife
father
near
the
arsenal
good
munroe
was
not
certain
whether
on
delaware
avenue
or
whether
on
t
street
u
street
or
v
street
and
indeed
whether
the
lady
name
were
butman
before
she
married
her
second
husband
and
lichtenfels
afterward
or
whether
his
name
were
butman
and
hers
lichtenfels
munroe
was
not
quite
sure
nor
could
she
say
whether
gilbert
took
the
account
books
and
registers
there
were
heaps
on
heaps
of
them
for
gilbert
had
been
a
notary
ever
since
general
jackson
day
or
whether
bundy
did
not
take
them
or
whether
they
were
not
sold
for
old
paper
munroe
was
not
sure
for
all
this
happened
all
the
and
removal
while
munroe
was
on
a
visit
to
her
sister
not
far
from
brick
church
above
little
falls
on
your
way
to
frederic
and
munroe
offered
this
visit
as
a
constant
apology
for
her
not
knowing
more
precisely
every
detail
of
her
old
business
this
explanation
took
a
good
deal
of
time
through
all
of
which
poor
beverly
was
fretting
and
fuming
and
stamping
his
cold
feet
in
the
passage
hearing
the
occasional
questions
of
his
sister
uttered
with
thunder
tone
in
the
above
but
hearing
no
word
of
the
placid
widow
replies
when
matty
returned
and
held
a
consultation
with
him
the
question
was
whether
to
follow
the
books
of
account
to
georgetown
where
bundy
was
understood
to
be
still
residing
or
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
arsenal
in
the
hope
of
finding
gilbert
lichtenfels
or
butman
as
the
case
might
be
readers
should
understand
that
these
two
points
both
unknown
to
the
young
people
are
some
six
miles
asunder
the
original
notary
office
being
about
between
them
beverly
was
more
disposed
to
advise
following
the
man
he
was
of
a
mind
to
attack
some
one
of
his
own
sex
but
the
enterprise
was
in
truth
matty
enterprise
beverly
had
but
little
faith
in
it
from
the
beginning
and
matty
was
minded
to
follow
such
clue
as
they
had
to
gilbert
quite
sure
that
woman
with
woman
she
should
succeed
better
with
her
than
man
with
man
beverly
with
bundy
beverly
assented
to
this
view
the
more
willingly
because
matty
was
quite
willing
to
undertake
the
quest
alone
she
was
very
brave
about
it
indeed
plenty
of
nice
people
at
the
arsenal
or
near
it
whom
she
could
fall
back
upon
for
counsel
or
information
so
they
parted
matty
took
a
street
car
for
the
east
and
south
and
beverly
went
his
ways
to
the
bureau
of
internal
improvement
to
report
for
duty
to
his
father
this
story
must
not
follow
the
details
of
quest
for
the
firm
of
gilbert
lichtenfels
or
butman
certain
it
is
that
she
would
never
have
succeeded
had
she
rested
simply
on
the
directory
or
on
such
crude
information
as
munroe
had
so
freely
given
but
matty
had
an
english
tongue
in
her
head
a
courteous
which
is
to
say
a
confiding
address
with
strangers
she
seemed
almost
to
be
conferring
a
favor
at
the
moment
when
she
asked
one
and
she
knew
in
this
business
that
there
was
no
such
word
as
fail
after
one
or
two
false
starts
some
very
stupid
answers
and
some
very
blunt
refusals
she
found
her
quarry
at
last
by
as
simple
a
process
as
walking
into
a
of
colored
children
where
she
heard
singing
in
the
basement
of
a
little
chapel
in
a
few
words
matty
explained
her
errand
to
the
superintendent
and
that
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
find
gilbert
before
dark
ting
one
stroke
of
the
bell
called
hundreds
of
eager
voices
to
silence
who
knows
where
gilbert
lives
is
it
at
butman
house
or
mrs
lichtenfels
twenty
eager
hands
contended
with
each
other
for
the
honor
of
giving
the
information
and
in
three
minutes
more
matty
all
encouraged
by
her
success
was
on
her
way
and
gilbert
was
at
home
good
fortune
number
two
matty
star
was
surely
in
the
ascendant
matty
sent
in
her
card
and
the
nice
old
lady
presented
herself
at
once
remembered
who
matty
was
remembered
how
much
business
molyneux
used
to
bring
to
the
office
and
how
grateful
gilbert
always
was
she
was
so
glad
to
see
matty
and
she
hoped
molyneux
was
well
and
molyneux
and
all
those
little
ones
she
used
to
see
them
every
sunday
as
they
went
to
church
if
they
went
on
the
avenue
thus
encouraged
matty
opened
on
her
sad
story
and
was
fairly
helped
from
stage
to
stage
by
the
wonder
indignation
and
exclamations
of
the
kind
old
lady
when
matty
came
to
the
end
and
made
her
understand
how
much
depended
on
the
register
and
ledger
of
her
husband
it
was
a
fair
minute
before
she
spoke
we
will
see
my
dear
we
will
see
i
wish
it
may
be
so
but
i
all
afeard
it
would
not
be
like
him
my
dear
it
would
not
be
like
any
of
them
but
come
with
me
my
dear
we
will
see
we
will
see
then
as
matty
followed
her
through
devious
ways
out
through
the
kitchen
across
a
queer
bricked
yard
into
a
half
stable
half
woodshed
which
the
good
woman
unlocked
she
went
on
talking
you
see
my
dear
child
that
though
notaries
are
called
notaries
as
if
it
were
their
business
to
give
notice
the
most
important
part
of
their
business
is
keeping
secrets
now
when
a
man
note
goes
to
protest
the
notary
tells
him
what
has
happened
which
he
knew
very
well
before
and
then
he
comes
to
the
notary
and
begs
him
not
to
tell
anybody
else
and
of
course
he
does
not
and
the
business
of
a
notary
account
books
as
my
husband
used
to
say
is
to
tell
just
enough
and
not
to
tell
any
more
why
my
dear
child
he
would
not
use
in
the
office
he
would
always
use
sand
paper
never
he
would
say
tells
secrets
with
such
chatter
they
came
to
the
little
chilly
room
which
was
shelved
all
around
and
to
matty
glad
eyes
presented
rows
of
green
and
blue
and
blue
and
red
boxes
and
folio
and
quarto
books
of
every
date
from
to
forty
years
in
which
the
late
gilbert
had
been
confirming
history
keeping
secret
what
he
knew
but
making
sure
what
but
for
him
might
have
been
doubted
by
a
sceptic
world
things
were
in
good
order
gilbert
was
proud
to
show
that
they
were
in
good
order
the
for
was
at
hand
matty
knew
the
fatal
dates
only
too
well
and
the
fatal
entries
were
here
how
her
heart
beat
as
she
began
to
read
cr
to
thomas
molyneux
i
i
official
authentication
of
signature
of
felipe
gazza
same
authentication
of
signature
of
jose
b
du
camara
same
authentication
of
signature
of
jacob
cole
and
this
was
all
poor
matty
copied
it
all
but
all
the
time
she
begged
gilbert
to
tell
her
if
there
was
not
some
or
journal
that
would
tell
more
and
kind
gilbert
looked
eagerly
for
what
she
called
the
diry
at
the
proper
dates
on
the
at
intervals
of
a
week
or
two
matty
found
similar
entries
the
names
of
the
two
spaniards
appearing
in
all
these
but
other
names
in
place
of
cole
just
as
tom
had
told
her
already
by
the
time
she
had
copied
all
of
these
gilbert
had
found
the
diry
eager
and
yet
sick
matty
turned
it
over
with
her
old
friend
this
was
all
molyneux
here
very
private
papers
in
and
then
followed
a
little
burst
of
unintelligible
poor
matty
she
could
not
but
feel
that
here
would
not
be
evidence
good
for
anything
even
in
a
novel
but
she
copied
every
word
carefully
as
a
chief
daughter
should
do
she
thanked
the
kind
old
lady
and
even
kissed
her
she
looked
at
her
watch
heavens
how
fast
time
had
gone
and
the
afternoons
were
so
short
yes
my
dear
miss
molyneux
but
they
have
turned
my
dear
the
day
is
a
little
longer
and
a
little
lighter
did
the
old
lady
mean
it
for
an
omen
or
was
it
only
one
of
those
chattering
remarks
on
meteors
and
weather
change
of
which
old
age
is
so
fond
matty
wondered
but
did
not
know
fast
as
she
could
she
tripped
bravely
on
to
the
avenue
for
her
street
car
the
day
is
longer
and
lighter
meanwhile
tom
was
following
his
clue
in
the
public
rooms
at
willard
to
which
as
he
prophesied
greenhithe
had
returned
after
the
unusual
variation
in
his
life
of
a
morning
spent
in
the
sanctuary
tom
bought
a
copy
of
the
baltimore
the
sun
and
went
into
one
of
the
larger
rooms
resorted
to
by
travellers
and
loafers
and
sat
down
but
greenhithe
did
not
appear
there
tom
walked
up
and
down
through
the
passages
a
little
uneasily
for
he
was
sure
the
had
come
into
the
hotel
he
went
up
and
looked
in
at
the
to
see
if
perhaps
some
duchess
of
devonshire
of
high
political
circles
had
found
it
worth
while
to
drag
greenhithe
up
there
by
a
single
hair
no
greenhithe
tom
was
forced
to
go
down
and
drink
a
glass
of
beer
to
see
if
greenhithe
was
not
thirsty
but
at
that
moment
though
greenhithe
was
generally
thirsty
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
although
many
men
were
thirsty
at
the
time
tom
hung
over
his
glass
of
lager
greenhithe
was
not
thirsty
there
it
was
only
as
tom
passed
the
that
he
saw
greenhithe
was
playing
a
game
of
billiards
by
way
of
celebrating
the
new
birth
of
a
regenerated
world
what
to
do
now
tom
could
not
in
common
decency
go
in
to
look
on
at
the
game
of
a
man
he
wanted
to
choke
yet
tom
would
have
given
all
his
chances
for
rank
in
the
academy
to
know
what
greenhithe
was
talking
about
tom
slowly
withdrew
as
he
withdrew
whom
should
be
meet
but
one
of
his
kindest
friends
commodore
benbow
when
the
boys
made
their
experimental
cruise
the
year
before
they
had
found
commodore
benbow
ship
at
lisbon
the
commodore
had
taken
a
particular
fancy
to
tom
because
he
had
known
his
mother
when
they
were
boy
and
girl
tom
had
even
been
invited
personally
to
the
and
was
to
have
been
presented
at
court
but
that
they
sailed
too
soon
to
tell
the
whole
truth
the
commodore
was
not
overpleased
to
see
his
protege
hanging
about
the
bar
and
on
christmas
day
for
himself
his
whole
family
were
living
at
willard
but
he
knew
father
was
not
living
there
and
he
thought
tom
might
be
better
employed
perhaps
tom
guessed
this
perhaps
he
was
in
despair
anyway
he
knew
old
benbow
as
the
boys
called
him
would
be
a
good
counsellor
in
point
of
statistics
old
benbow
was
just
turned
forty
had
not
a
gray
hair
in
his
head
could
have
beaten
any
one
of
tom
class
whether
in
gunning
or
at
billiards
could
have
demonstrated
every
problem
in
euclid
while
they
were
fiddling
over
the
proposition
he
was
at
the
very
prime
of
power
but
young
nineteen
called
him
old
benbow
as
young
nineteen
will
in
such
cases
bold
with
despair
or
with
love
for
his
father
tom
stopped
old
benbow
and
asked
him
if
he
would
come
into
one
of
the
with
him
then
he
made
this
venerable
man
his
confidant
the
commodore
had
seen
the
slurs
in
the
scorpion
and
the
argus
and
the
evening
journal
a
pity
said
he
that
newspaper
row
that
can
do
so
much
good
should
do
so
much
harm
what
is
newspaper
row
three
or
four
men
of
honor
three
or
four
dreamers
three
or
four
schoolboys
three
or
four
fools
and
three
or
four
scamps
and
the
public
molyneux
which
is
to
say
you
and
i
accept
the
trumpet
blast
of
one
of
these
heralds
precisely
as
we
do
that
of
another
practically
said
he
pensively
when
we
were
detached
to
serve
with
the
corps
in
mobile
bay
i
found
i
liked
the
talk
of
those
men
who
had
been
in
every
scrimmage
of
the
war
quite
as
much
as
i
did
that
of
the
bandmen
who
played
the
trumpets
on
parade
but
this
is
neither
here
nor
there
i
thought
of
coming
round
to
see
your
father
but
i
knew
i
should
bother
him
what
can
i
do
my
boy
then
tom
told
him
rather
doubtfully
that
he
had
reason
to
fear
that
greenhithe
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
scandal
he
said
he
wished
he
did
not
think
that
greenhithe
had
himself
stolen
the
papers
if
i
am
wrong
i
want
to
know
it
said
he
if
i
am
right
i
want
to
know
it
i
do
not
want
to
be
doing
any
man
injustice
but
i
do
not
want
to
keep
old
eben
ricketts
down
at
the
department
hunting
for
a
file
of
papers
which
greenhithe
has
hidden
in
his
trunk
or
put
into
the
fire
no
no
no
indeed
said
old
benbow
musing
no
no
no
then
after
a
pause
tom
said
he
come
round
here
in
an
hour
i
know
that
young
fellow
your
friend
is
playing
with
and
i
wish
he
were
in
better
company
than
he
is
i
think
i
know
enough
of
the
usages
of
modern
society
to
him
and
his
companion
though
times
have
changed
since
i
was
of
your
age
in
that
regard
come
here
in
an
hour
or
give
me
rather
more
come
here
at
two
and
we
will
see
what
we
will
see
so
tom
went
round
to
the
navy
department
and
here
he
found
the
faithful
eben
faithful
to
him
though
utterly
faithless
as
to
any
success
in
the
special
quest
which
was
making
the
entertainment
of
the
christmas
holiday
vainly
did
tom
repeat
to
him
his
formula
if
the
navy
did
the
work
the
navy
has
the
vouchers
my
dear
boy
eben
ricketts
repeated
a
hundred
times
though
the
navy
did
the
work
the
navy
did
not
provide
the
pork
and
beans
it
did
not
arrange
in
advance
for
the
landing
least
of
all
did
it
buy
the
greasers
i
will
look
where
you
like
for
love
of
your
father
and
you
but
that
file
of
vouchers
is
not
here
never
was
here
and
never
will
be
found
here
an
assistant
like
this
is
not
an
encouraging
companion
or
adviser
and
in
short
the
vouchers
were
not
found
in
the
navy
department
in
that
particular
midday
search
at
minutes
past
two
tom
gave
it
up
unwillingly
bade
eben
ricketts
washed
from
his
hands
the
accretions
of
which
will
gather
even
on
in
navy
departments
and
ran
across
in
front
of
the
president
house
to
willard
he
looked
up
at
the
white
house
and
wondered
how
the
people
there
were
spending
their
christmas
day
commodore
benbow
was
waiting
for
him
he
took
him
up
into
his
own
parlor
molyneux
your
greenhithe
is
either
the
most
ingenious
liar
and
the
best
actor
on
god
earth
or
he
knows
no
more
of
your
lost
papers
than
a
child
in
heaven
i
went
back
to
the
after
you
left
me
i
walked
up
to
millet
that
was
lieutenant
millet
playing
with
greenhithe
and
i
shook
hands
he
had
to
introduce
me
to
your
friend
then
i
asked
them
both
to
come
here
told
millet
i
had
some
papers
from
montevideo
that
he
would
be
glad
to
see
and
that
i
should
be
glad
of
a
call
when
they
had
done
their
game
well
they
came
i
am
sorry
to
say
your
friend
oh
do
my
dear
commodore
benbow
do
call
him
my
friend
even
in
a
joke
it
makes
me
feel
awfully
i
am
glad
it
does
said
the
commodore
laughing
well
i
am
very
sorry
to
say
that
the
black
sheep
had
been
drinking
more
of
the
whisky
downstairs
than
was
good
for
him
and
no
fault
of
mine
he
drank
more
of
my
madeira
than
he
should
have
done
and
tom
i
do
not
believe
he
was
in
any
condition
to
keep
secrets
well
first
of
all
it
appeared
that
he
had
been
in
bremen
and
vienna
for
six
months
he
only
arrived
in
new
york
yesterday
morning
tom
face
fell
and
next
you
may
take
this
for
what
it
is
worth
but
i
believe
he
spoke
the
truth
for
once
he
certainly
did
if
there
is
any
truth
in
liquor
or
in
swearing
for
when
i
asked
millet
what
all
this
stuff
about
your
father
meant
greenhithe
interrupted
very
unnecessarily
and
very
rudely
and
said
with
more
oaths
than
i
will
trouble
you
with
that
the
whole
was
a
damned
lie
of
the
newspaper
men
that
they
had
lied
about
him
greenhithe
and
now
were
lying
about
old
molyneux
that
molyneux
had
been
very
hard
on
him
and
very
unjust
to
him
but
he
would
say
that
he
was
honest
as
the
clock
honest
enough
to
be
mean
and
that
he
would
say
that
to
the
committee
if
they
would
call
on
him
and
so
on
and
so
on
much
good
would
he
do
before
the
committee
said
poor
tom
and
thus
ended
tom
branch
of
the
investigation
come
to
me
if
i
can
help
you
my
boy
said
old
benbow
it
is
always
the
darkest
old
fellow
the
hour
before
day
tom
was
astronomer
enough
to
know
that
this
old
saw
was
as
false
as
most
old
saws
but
with
this
for
his
only
comfort
he
returned
to
the
bureau
to
seek
beverly
and
his
father
neither
beverly
nor
his
father
was
there
tom
went
directly
home
his
mother
was
eager
to
see
him
she
had
come
home
alone
and
save
horace
and
laura
and
flossy
and
brick
she
had
seen
nobody
but
a
messenger
from
the
bureau
brick
was
the
family
name
for
robert
one
of
the
youngest
of
this
household
of
beverly
movements
the
story
must
be
more
briefly
told
they
took
more
time
than
tom
as
much
indeed
as
his
sister
after
they
parted
but
they
were
conducted
by
means
of
that
marvel
of
marvels
the
telegraph
the
chief
of
whose
marvels
is
that
it
compels
even
a
winded
generation
like
ours
to
speak
in
very
short
metre
beverly
began
with
bundy
at
georgetown
georgetown
is
but
a
quiet
place
on
the
most
active
of
days
on
christmas
day
beverly
found
but
little
stirring
out
of
doors
still
with
the
directory
with
the
advice
of
a
and
the
information
of
a
police
officer
beverly
tracked
bundy
to
his
lair
it
was
not
a
notary
office
it
was
a
liquor
shop
of
the
lowest
grade
with
many
badly
painted
signs
which
explained
that
this
was
our
house
and
that
here
bundy
made
and
sold
with
proper
license
let
us
be
grateful
tom
and
jerry
smashes
cocktails
and
did
other
deeds
without
a
name
on
this
occasion
however
even
the
door
of
our
house
was
closed
bundy
had
gone
to
a
match
at
fairfax
court
house
the
period
of
his
return
was
very
doubtful
he
had
never
done
anything
but
keep
this
since
old
gilbert
turned
him
out
of
doors
with
this
information
master
beverly
returned
to
town
he
then
began
on
his
own
line
of
search
relying
on
tom
news
he
went
to
the
office
of
the
western
union
telegraph
and
concocted
this
despatch
which
he
thought
a
masterpiece
greensburg
westmoreland
to
robert
john
whilthaugh
when
and
where
can
i
see
you
on
important
business
answer
beverly
molyneux
for
thomas
molyneux
then
he
took
a
walk
and
after
half
an
hour
called
at
the
office
again
the
office
was
still
engaged
in
calling
greensburg
greensburg
was
eating
its
christmas
dinner
but
at
last
greensburg
was
called
then
beverly
received
this
answer
whilthaugh
has
been
dead
more
than
a
year
greensburg
to
which
beverly
replied
where
does
his
wife
live
or
his
administrator
to
which
greensburg
having
been
called
a
second
time
with
difficulty
replied
his
wife
is
crazy
and
we
never
heard
of
any
property
greensburg
with
this
result
of
his
investment
as
a
member
of
the
great
western
union
mutual
information
club
beverly
returned
home
chewing
the
cud
of
sweet
and
bitter
fancies
there
is
no
speech
nor
language
sang
the
choir
in
matthews
as
he
passed
where
their
voice
is
not
heard
their
line
is
gone
out
through
all
the
earth
and
tom
heard
no
more
as
he
passed
on
as
he
walked
almost
unwillingly
up
the
street
to
the
high
steps
of
his
father
house
matty
out
of
breath
overtook
him
what
have
you
found
bev
nothing
said
the
boy
moodily
and
poor
matty
had
to
confess
that
she
had
hardly
more
to
tell
they
came
into
the
house
by
the
lower
entrance
that
they
need
not
attract
their
mother
attention
but
she
was
on
the
alert
even
horace
and
the
younger
children
knew
by
this
time
that
something
was
wrong
horace
story
about
the
strange
man
and
papa
was
the
last
news
of
papa
papa
had
not
been
at
the
bureau
the
bureau
people
waited
for
him
till
two
and
he
did
not
come
then
stratton
had
come
round
to
see
if
he
was
to
keep
open
any
longer
stratton
had
told
molyneux
that
her
husband
had
not
been
there
since
church
where
in
the
world
was
he
poor
molyneux
had
not
known
where
to
send
or
to
go
she
had
just
looked
in
at
the
doctor
but
he
was
not
there
tom
had
appeared
first
to
her
tedious
waiting
tom
would
not
tell
her
but
he
even
went
and
looked
in
on
newspaper
row
which
he
had
been
abusing
so
for
first
thought
was
that
a
formal
information
had
been
lodged
somewhere
and
that
his
father
was
arrested
but
newspaper
row
evidently
was
unsuspicious
of
any
arrest
tom
even
walked
down
to
the
old
jail
and
made
an
absurd
errand
to
see
the
but
the
marshal
was
at
his
christmas
dinner
tom
told
all
this
in
the
hall
to
beverly
and
to
matty
everything
had
failed
and
papa
was
gone
who
could
the
man
in
the
shaggy
coat
be
the
three
went
together
into
the
parlor
for
a
little
matty
and
horace
and
tom
and
beverly
then
made
a
pretence
of
arranging
the
tree
but
in
truth
molyneux
in
the
midst
of
all
her
care
had
done
that
while
they
were
all
away
dinner
was
postponed
half
an
hour
and
they
gathered
all
in
the
darkness
looking
at
the
sickliest
blaze
that
ever
rambled
over
cumberland
coal
the
brick
came
climbing
up
on
tom
knees
and
bade
him
tell
a
story
but
even
laura
saw
that
something
was
wrong
and
hushed
the
child
and
said
she
and
flossy
would
sing
one
of
their
carols
and
they
sang
it
and
were
praised
and
they
sang
another
and
were
praised
but
then
it
was
quite
dark
and
nobody
had
any
heart
to
say
one
word
where
is
papa
said
the
brick
where
indeed
everybody
wanted
to
say
and
no
one
did
but
then
the
rang
and
chloe
brought
in
a
note
he
waiting
for
an
answer
mum
and
tom
lighted
the
gas
it
popped
up
so
bright
that
little
flossy
said
the
people
that
sat
in
darkness
saw
a
great
light
this
was
just
as
molyneux
tore
open
the
note
for
the
instant
she
could
not
speak
she
handed
it
to
the
three
found
home
in
half
an
hour
all
right
thank
god
saw
a
great
light
indeed
said
horace
who
for
once
felt
awed
chapter
v
this
is
christmas
for
half
a
minute
as
it
seemed
afterwards
no
one
spoke
then
matty
flew
to
her
mother
and
flung
her
arms
around
her
neck
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
tom
hardly
knew
what
he
was
doing
but
he
recovered
enough
to
know
that
he
must
try
to
be
manly
and
businesslike
and
so
he
rushed
downstairs
to
find
the
man
who
brought
the
note
it
proved
to
be
a
man
he
did
not
know
not
a
messenger
from
the
bureau
not
one
from
the
navy
department
least
of
all
an
aid
of
the
assistant
marshal
he
was
an
innocent
waiter
from
the
seaton
house
who
said
a
gentleman
called
him
and
gave
him
the
note
told
him
to
lose
no
time
and
gave
him
half
a
dollar
for
coming
he
had
asked
for
an
answer
though
the
gentleman
had
not
told
him
to
do
so
tom
wrote
hurrah
all
well
all
at
t
and
gave
this
note
to
the
man
they
all
talked
at
once
and
then
they
sat
still
without
talking
the
children
must
it
be
confessed
asked
all
sorts
of
inopportune
questions
at
last
tom
was
even
fain
to
tell
the
story
of
the
bear
himself
by
way
of
silencing
the
brick
and
laura
and
with
much
correction
from
horace
had
got
the
bear
well
advanced
in
smelling
at
the
and
the
figs
when
a
carriage
was
heard
on
the
street
evidently
coming
rapidly
towards
them
it
stopped
at
the
door
the
bear
was
forgotten
as
all
the
elders
in
this
family
rushed
out
of
the
parlor
into
the
hall
papa
was
there
and
was
as
happy
as
they
with
papa
or
just
behind
him
came
in
the
man
with
the
rough
coat
whose
face
at
church
had
been
so
dirty
whose
face
now
was
clean
to
think
that
papa
should
have
brought
the
with
him
for
by
the
name
of
the
marshal
had
this
mysterious
stranger
been
spoken
of
in
private
by
the
two
young
men
since
the
fatal
theory
had
been
advanced
that
he
had
come
into
the
church
to
arrest
molyneux
the
unknown
with
great
tact
managed
to
keep
in
the
background
while
molyneux
kissed
her
husband
and
while
matty
kissed
him
and
while
among
them
they
pulled
off
his
coat
but
molyneux
did
not
forget
he
made
a
chance
in
a
moment
for
saying
you
must
speak
to
our
friend
who
has
brought
me
here
no
one
was
ever
so
welcome
at
a
christmas
dinner
kuypers
my
dear
kuypers
matty
dear
these
are
my
boys
mr
kuypers
then
the
ladies
welcomed
the
stranger
and
the
boys
shook
hands
with
him
molyneux
added
what
hardly
any
one
understood
it
is
not
every
friend
that
travels
two
thousand
miles
to
jog
a
friend
memory
and
they
all
huddled
into
the
parlor
but
in
a
moment
more
molyneux
had
invited
kuypers
to
go
upstairs
to
wash
himself
and
he
with
good
feeling
which
he
showed
all
the
evening
gladly
took
himself
out
of
the
way
and
so
as
tom
returned
from
showing
him
to
his
room
the
parlor
was
filled
with
those
god
made
there
as
the
little
boy
used
to
say
and
with
none
beside
now
tell
us
all
about
it
dear
papa
cried
tom
i
was
trying
to
tell
your
mother
but
there
is
not
much
to
tell
poor
kuypers
had
travelled
all
the
way
from
colorado
the
minute
he
heard
i
was
in
trouble
yesterday
he
bought
the
in
the
train
and
found
the
committee
was
down
on
us
he
drove
here
from
the
station
as
soon
as
the
train
came
in
he
missed
you
here
and
drove
by
mistake
to
trinity
that
made
him
late
with
us
and
so
as
the
service
had
begun
he
waited
till
it
was
done
well
said
bev
perhaps
a
little
impatiently
but
so
soon
as
we
were
going
out
he
touched
me
and
said
he
had
come
to
find
me
in
the
matter
of
the
rio
grande
vouchers
do
you
know
eliza
i
can
afford
to
laugh
at
it
now
but
at
the
moment
i
thought
he
was
a
deputy
of
the
there
screamed
tom
i
said
he
was
a
i
said
and
i
laughed
and
said
they
seemed
to
interest
all
my
friends
then
he
said
you
have
them
if
i
had
known
that
i
would
have
spared
my
journey
this
threw
me
off
guard
and
i
said
i
supposed
i
had
them
but
i
could
not
find
them
and
he
said
eagerly
this
was
just
on
the
church
steps
i
can
then
he
said
he
had
a
carriage
waiting
and
he
bade
me
jump
in
so
soon
as
we
were
in
the
carriage
he
explained
what
i
ought
to
have
remembered
but
could
not
then
recollect
for
the
life
of
me
that
after
general
trebou
returned
from
texas
there
was
a
court
of
inquiry
and
that
there
was
some
question
about
these
very
supplies
the
beans
and
the
coffee
particularly
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
landing
nor
with
the
mexicans
and
the
court
of
inquiry
sent
over
one
day
from
the
war
department
where
they
were
sitting
to
our
office
for
an
account
because
we
were
said
to
have
it
kuypers
was
their
messenger
to
us
and
because
we
had
bound
them
all
together
the
whole
file
was
sent
as
it
was
he
took
them
and
as
it
happened
he
looked
them
over
and
what
was
better
he
remembered
them
where
our
receipt
is
heaven
knows
well
that
court
of
inquiry
was
endless
as
those
army
inquiries
always
are
kuypers
was
in
attendance
all
the
time
he
says
he
never
shall
forget
it
if
other
people
do
so
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
we
were
in
trouble
at
the
bureau
that
i
was
in
trouble
i
mean
said
molyneux
stoutly
he
knew
that
he
knew
what
nobody
else
knew
that
the
vouchers
were
in
the
papers
of
that
court
of
inquiry
and
he
came
all
the
way
to
tell
what
a
good
fellow
yes
he
came
on
purpose
he
says
he
could
not
help
coming
he
says
he
made
two
or
three
telegrams
but
every
time
he
tried
to
telegraph
he
felt
as
if
he
were
shirking
and
i
believe
he
was
right
i
believe
we
should
never
have
pulled
through
without
him
presence
moves
the
world
as
eli
thayer
used
to
say
and
you
found
them
asked
molyneux
faintly
essaying
to
get
back
to
the
story
oh
yes
we
found
them
but
not
in
one
minute
you
see
first
of
all
i
had
to
go
to
the
chief
clerk
at
the
war
department
and
get
the
department
opened
on
a
holiday
then
we
had
no
end
of
clerks
to
disturb
at
their
christmas
dinners
and
at
last
we
found
a
good
fellow
named
breen
who
was
willing
to
take
hold
with
kuypers
and
kuypers
himself
here
he
dropped
his
voice
why
we
have
not
three
men
in
all
the
departments
who
know
the
history
of
this
government
or
the
system
of
its
records
as
he
does
once
in
the
office
he
went
to
work
like
a
master
breen
was
amazed
why
we
found
those
documents
in
less
than
half
an
hour
then
i
sent
breen
with
a
note
to
the
secretary
he
was
good
as
gold
came
down
in
his
own
carriage
congratulated
me
as
heartily
well
almost
as
heartily
as
you
do
tom
and
took
us
both
round
with
the
files
to
mcdermot
the
chairman
of
the
house
committee
he
was
dining
with
his
mess
at
the
seaton
house
but
we
called
him
out
and
i
declare
i
believe
he
was
as
much
pleased
as
we
were
i
only
stopped
to
make
him
give
me
a
receipt
for
the
papers
because
they
all
said
it
was
idle
to
take
copies
and
here
we
are
on
the
hush
that
followed
the
brick
made
his
way
up
on
his
father
knee
and
said
and
now
papa
will
you
tell
us
the
story
of
the
bear
tom
does
not
tell
it
very
well
they
all
laughed
they
could
afford
to
laugh
now
and
molyneux
was
just
beginning
upon
the
story
of
the
bear
when
kuypers
reappeared
he
had
in
this
short
time
revised
his
toilet
and
looked
molyneux
said
in
an
aside
like
the
angel
of
light
that
he
was
bears
said
he
are
there
any
bears
in
washington
why
it
was
only
last
monday
that
i
killed
a
bear
and
i
ate
him
on
tuesday
did
you
eat
him
all
asked
the
brick
whose
reverence
for
kuypers
was
much
more
increased
by
this
story
than
by
any
of
the
unintelligible
conversation
which
had
gone
before
but
just
as
kuypers
began
on
the
story
of
the
bear
chloe
appeared
with
beaming
face
and
announced
that
dinner
was
ready
that
dinner
which
this
morning
every
one
who
had
any
sense
had
so
dreaded
and
which
now
seemed
a
festival
indeed
well
there
was
great
pretence
in
fun
and
form
in
marshalling
and
kuypers
gave
his
arm
to
matty
and
horace
his
to
laura
and
beverly
his
to
flossy
and
tom
brought
up
the
rear
with
the
brick
on
his
shoulders
and
molyneux
returned
thanks
and
asked
a
blessing
all
together
and
then
they
fell
to
on
the
turkey
and
on
the
chicken
pie
and
they
tried
to
talk
about
colorado
and
mining
about
gold
hill
and
and
uncle
sam
and
overman
and
yellow
jacket
but
in
spite
of
them
all
the
talk
would
drift
back
to
bundy
and
his
various
signs
our
house
and
tom
and
jerry
to
the
wife
of
whilthaugh
to
commodore
benbow
to
old
gilbert
and
delaware
avenue
and
this
was
really
quite
as
much
the
fault
of
kuypers
as
it
was
of
any
of
the
molyneux
family
he
seemed
as
much
one
of
them
as
did
tom
himself
this
anecdote
of
failure
and
that
of
success
kept
cropping
out
walsingham
and
dignified
enthusiasm
for
the
triumph
of
the
office
and
the
satisfaction
that
eben
ricketts
would
feel
when
he
was
told
that
the
navy
never
had
the
vouchers
all
were
commented
on
then
molyneux
would
start
and
say
we
are
talking
shop
again
you
say
the
autumn
has
been
mild
in
the
mountains
and
then
in
two
minutes
they
would
be
on
the
trail
of
search
and
look
again
it
was
in
one
of
these
false
starts
that
kuypers
explained
why
he
came
which
in
horace
mind
and
perhaps
in
the
minds
of
the
others
had
been
the
question
most
puzzling
of
all
why
said
horace
bluntly
had
you
ever
heard
of
papa
before
had
i
heard
of
him
said
kuypers
i
think
so
why
my
dear
boy
your
father
is
my
oldest
and
kindest
friend
at
this
exclamation
even
molyneux
showed
amazement
tom
laid
down
his
fork
and
looked
to
see
if
the
man
was
crazy
and
molyneux
himself
was
thrown
off
his
balance
kuypers
was
a
man
but
this
time
he
could
not
conceal
his
amazement
he
laid
down
knife
and
fork
both
looked
up
and
almost
laughed
as
he
said
with
wonder
do
you
know
who
i
am
we
know
you
are
our
good
angel
said
molyneux
bravely
and
that
is
enough
to
know
but
do
you
know
why
i
am
here
or
what
sent
me
molyneux
said
that
he
understood
very
well
that
his
friend
wanted
to
see
justice
done
and
that
he
had
preferred
to
see
to
this
in
person
i
thought
you
looked
queer
said
kuypers
frankly
but
still
i
did
not
know
i
was
changed
why
do
you
remember
bruce
you
remember
chappell
surely
are
you
bruce
cried
molyneux
and
he
fairly
left
his
chair
and
went
round
the
table
to
the
young
man
why
i
can
see
it
now
but
then
why
you
were
a
boy
you
know
and
this
black
beard
but
pray
explain
pray
explain
cried
tom
the
mysteries
increase
on
us
who
is
chappell
and
for
that
matter
who
is
bruce
if
his
real
name
be
not
kuypers
and
they
all
laughed
heartily
people
got
back
their
a
little
and
kuypers
explained
i
am
bruce
kuypers
said
he
though
your
father
does
not
seem
to
remember
the
kuypers
part
no
said
molyneux
i
can
not
remember
the
kuypers
part
but
the
bruce
part
i
remember
very
well
my
mother
was
kuypers
before
she
married
chappell
and
chappell
died
when
my
brother
ben
was
six
years
old
and
little
lizzy
was
a
baby
lizzy
was
my
godchild
said
molyneux
who
now
remembered
everything
certainly
she
was
molyneux
and
last
month
lizzy
was
married
to
as
good
a
fellow
as
ever
presided
over
the
melting
of
ingots
we
marry
them
earlier
at
the
west
than
you
do
here
where
lizzie
would
have
been
he
said
more
gravely
addressing
tom
again
where
my
mother
would
have
been
or
where
i
should
have
been
but
for
your
father
and
mother
here
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
and
all
i
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
to
him
as
to
me
this
has
been
one
part
of
that
old
christmas
surely
you
remember
he
turned
to
molyneux
yes
molyneux
did
remember
but
her
eyes
were
all
running
over
with
tears
and
she
did
not
say
so
molyneux
said
bruce
kuypers
again
addressing
tom
seventeen
years
ago
this
blessed
day
there
was
a
christmas
morning
in
the
poor
old
tenement
above
massachusetts
avenue
such
as
you
never
saw
and
such
as
i
hope
you
never
may
see
there
was
fire
in
the
stove
because
your
father
had
sent
the
coal
there
was
oatmeal
mush
on
the
table
because
your
father
paid
my
mother
scot
at
your
father
grocer
but
there
was
not
much
jollity
in
that
house
and
there
were
no
christmas
presents
but
what
your
mother
had
sent
to
bruce
and
ben
and
flora
and
even
to
the
baby
still
we
kept
up
such
courage
as
we
could
it
was
a
terribly
cold
day
and
there
was
a
wet
storm
all
of
a
sudden
a
carriage
stopped
at
the
door
and
in
came
your
father
here
he
came
to
say
that
that
mail
had
brought
a
letter
from
wilder
of
the
navy
conveying
the
full
certificate
that
william
death
was
caused
by
exposure
in
the
service
that
certificate
was
what
my
mother
needed
for
her
pension
she
never
could
get
it
but
your
father
here
had
sifted
and
worried
and
worked
the
arrived
thursday
at
new
york
and
had
wilder
on
board
and
friday
afternoon
your
father
had
wilder
letter
and
he
left
his
own
christmas
dinner
to
make
light
my
and
mine
that
was
not
all
your
father
as
he
came
had
stopped
to
see
birdsall
who
was
the
speaker
of
the
house
he
had
seen
the
speaker
before
and
had
said
kind
things
about
me
and
that
day
the
speaker
told
him
to
tell
me
to
come
and
see
him
at
his
room
at
the
capitol
next
day
oh
how
my
mother
dressed
me
up
was
there
ever
such
a
page
seen
before
what
with
your
kind
words
and
my
dear
mother
extra
buttons
the
speaker
made
me
his
own
page
the
next
day
and
there
i
served
for
four
years
it
was
then
that
i
was
big
enough
to
go
into
the
war
department
and
goodsell
he
was
the
next
speaker
if
you
remember
recommended
me
there
after
that
said
bruce
kuypers
modestly
if
i
did
not
see
you
so
often
but
i
used
to
see
you
sometimes
and
i
did
not
think
this
with
a
roguish
twinkling
of
the
eye
that
you
forgot
your
young
friends
so
soon
i
remember
you
said
tom
i
used
to
think
you
were
the
grandest
man
in
washington
you
gave
me
the
first
ride
on
a
sled
i
ever
had
when
there
was
some
exceptional
fall
of
snow
i
think
we
all
remember
kuypers
now
said
matty
and
she
laughed
while
she
blushed
he
always
bought
things
for
our
stockings
i
have
a
noah
ark
upstairs
now
that
he
gave
me
in
my
youngest
days
i
had
a
queer
mixture
of
the
name
bruce
and
the
name
santa
claus
i
believe
i
thought
santa
claus
name
was
nicholas
bruce
i
am
sure
i
did
not
know
that
bruce
had
any
other
name
if
you
had
said
you
were
chappell
said
molyneux
i
should
have
known
you
in
a
minute
but
i
was
not
said
the
young
man
laughing
well
if
you
had
said
you
were
i
should
have
known
dear
me
yes
but
i
have
been
a
man
so
long
and
at
gem
city
nobody
calls
me
bruce
but
my
mother
and
lizzy
so
i
said
kuypers
forgetting
that
i
had
ever
been
a
boy
but
now
i
am
in
washington
again
i
shall
remember
that
things
change
here
very
fast
in
ten
years
and
yet
not
so
fast
as
they
change
at
the
mines
and
now
everybody
was
at
ease
how
well
molyneux
recalled
to
herself
what
she
would
not
speak
of
that
christmas
day
of
which
kuypers
told
his
story
it
was
in
their
young
married
life
she
had
her
father
and
mother
to
dine
with
her
and
the
event
was
really
a
trial
in
her
young
experience
and
then
just
as
the
old
folks
were
expected
her
husband
came
dashing
in
and
had
asked
her
to
put
dinner
a
little
later
because
he
had
had
this
good
news
for
the
poor
widow
chappell
and
she
had
to
tell
her
father
and
mother
when
they
came
that
they
must
all
wait
for
his
return
the
widow
chappell
was
one
of
those
waifs
who
seem
attracted
to
washington
by
some
fatal
law
it
had
been
two
or
three
months
before
that
molyneux
had
been
asked
to
hunt
her
up
and
help
her
a
letter
had
come
asking
him
to
do
this
from
fales
in
roxbury
and
fales
had
sent
money
for
the
chappells
but
the
money
had
gone
in
back
rent
and
shoes
and
the
rest
and
the
wolf
was
very
near
the
chappells
door
when
the
telegraph
announced
the
macedonian
molyneux
had
telegraphed
instanter
to
this
wilder
wilder
had
some
sense
of
christmas
promptness
he
remembered
poor
chappell
perfectly
and
mailed
that
night
a
thorough
certificate
this
certificate
it
was
which
molyneux
had
carried
to
the
poor
old
tenement
of
massachusetts
avenue
and
this
had
made
happy
that
christmas
day
and
this
why
said
bruce
kuypers
almost
as
if
he
were
speaking
aloud
it
seems
so
queer
that
christmas
comes
and
goes
with
you
and
you
have
forgotten
all
about
that
stormy
day
and
your
ride
to
chappell
why
at
our
place
we
drink
molyneux
health
every
christmas
day
and
i
am
afraid
the
little
ones
used
to
think
that
you
had
a
red
nose
a
gray
beard
and
came
down
the
chimney
as
at
another
place
said
matty
they
thought
of
bruce
of
noah
ark
memory
anyway
said
molyneux
any
crumbs
of
comfort
we
scattered
that
day
were
bread
upon
the
waters
of
kuypers
quick
journey
the
main
points
have
been
told
six
days
before
by
some
good
luck
which
could
hardly
have
been
expected
the
gem
city
medium
despatch
from
washington
was
full
enough
to
be
intelligible
it
was
headed
another
swindler
nailed
it
said
that
molyneux
of
the
internal
improvement
office
had
feathered
his
nest
with
during
the
war
in
a
pretended
expedition
to
the
rio
grande
it
had
now
been
discovered
that
there
never
was
any
such
expedition
and
the
correspondent
of
the
associated
press
hoped
that
justice
would
be
done
the
moment
bruce
kuypers
read
this
he
was
anxious
before
an
hour
passed
he
had
determined
to
cross
to
the
pacific
train
eastward
before
night
he
was
in
a
day
by
day
as
he
met
eastern
papers
he
searched
for
news
of
the
investigation
day
by
day
he
met
it
but
thanks
to
his
promptness
he
had
arrived
in
time
it
was
pathetic
to
hear
him
describe
his
anxiety
from
point
to
point
and
they
were
all
hushed
to
silence
when
he
told
how
glad
he
was
when
he
found
he
should
certainly
appear
on
christmas
day
after
the
dinner
another
procession
not
wholly
unlike
the
rabble
rout
of
the
morning
moved
from
the
to
the
great
front
parlor
where
the
tree
was
lighted
and
parcels
of
gray
and
white
and
brown
lay
round
on
mantel
on
piano
on
chairs
on
tables
and
on
the
floor
no
this
tale
is
too
long
already
we
will
not
tell
what
all
the
presents
were
to
all
the
ten
to
venty
chloe
diana
and
all
of
their
color
only
let
it
tell
that
all
the
ten
had
presents
to
surprise
and
to
every
one
surprise
indeed
there
were
careful
presents
for
him
as
for
the
rest
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
horace
and
laura
had
spelled
chipah
a
little
wildly
the
truth
was
that
each
separate
person
had
feared
that
he
would
feel
a
little
left
on
one
side
he
to
whom
so
much
was
due
on
that
day
and
each
person
severally
down
to
the
brick
himself
had
gone
secretly
without
consulting
the
others
to
select
from
his
own
possessions
something
very
dear
and
had
wrapped
it
up
and
marked
it
for
the
stranger
when
kuypers
opened
a
pretty
paper
to
find
matty
own
illustrated
browning
he
was
touched
indeed
when
in
a
rough
brown
paper
he
found
the
brick
labelled
for
the
man
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
the
next
day
the
evening
lantern
contained
this
editorial
article
the
absurd
fiasco
regarding
the
accounts
of
molyneux
which
has
occupied
the
correspondents
of
the
periodical
press
for
some
days
and
has
even
been
adverted
to
in
new
york
journals
claiming
the
title
of
metropolitan
came
to
a
fit
end
at
the
capitol
yesterday
the
wiseacre
owls
who
started
it
did
not
see
fit
to
put
in
an
appearance
before
the
committee
molyneux
himself
sent
to
the
chairman
a
most
interesting
volume
of
manuscript
which
is
indeed
a
valuable
historical
memorial
of
times
that
tried
men
souls
the
committee
and
other
gentlemen
present
examined
this
curious
record
with
great
interest
not
to
speak
of
the
minor
details
an
autograph
letter
of
the
lamented
trebou
gives
full
credit
to
the
bureau
of
internal
improvement
for
the
skill
with
which
they
executed
the
commission
given
them
in
a
department
quite
out
of
their
line
our
brethren
of
the
will
be
pleased
to
know
that
every
grain
of
oats
and
every
spear
of
straw
paid
for
by
the
now
famous
are
accounted
for
in
detail
the
authenticated
signatures
of
the
somewhat
celebrated
camara
and
gazza
and
the
mythical
captain
cole
appear
very
valuable
letters
throwing
interesting
light
on
our
relations
with
the
government
of
mexico
from
the
pens
of
the
lamented
adams
and
prigg
show
what
were
the
services
of
those
spanish
turncoats
and
their
allies
we
can
not
say
that
we
regret
the
attention
which
has
thus
been
given
to
a
very
important
piece
of
history
too
long
neglected
in
the
rush
of
more
petty
affairs
we
take
the
occasion
however
to
enter
our
protest
once
more
against
this
preposterous
system
of
in
which
as
it
were
in
echo
to
every
niaiserie
of
every
hired
pen
in
the
country
the
house
degrades
itself
to
the
work
of
the
common
scavenger
orders
at
immense
expense
an
investigation
into
some
subject
where
all
well
informed
persons
are
fully
advised
and
at
a
cost
of
the
national
treasure
etc
to
the
end
of
that
chapter
but
i
fear
no
one
at
the
molyneux
mansion
had
the
lantern
they
had
found
a
man
and
did
not
need
a
lantern
to
look
farther
it
was
as
molyneux
had
said
he
had
cast
his
bread
upon
the
waters
and
he
had
found
it
after
many
days
the
lost
palace
the
lost
palace
from
the
ingham
papers
passengers
for
philadelphia
and
new
york
will
change
cars
this
annoying
and
astonishing
cry
was
loudly
made
in
the
city
of
thebes
at
pittsburg
just
as
the
babies
were
well
asleep
and
all
the
passengers
adapting
themselves
to
a
quiet
evening
impossible
said
i
mildly
to
the
gentlemanly
conductor
who
beamed
before
me
in
the
majesty
of
gilt
lace
on
his
cap
and
the
embroidered
letters
these
letters
do
not
mean
as
in
french
to
take
leave
for
the
peculiarity
of
this
man
is
that
he
does
not
leave
you
till
your
journey
end
they
mean
in
american
pullman
palace
car
impossible
said
i
i
bought
my
ticket
at
chicago
through
to
philadelphia
with
the
assurance
that
the
would
go
through
this
lady
has
done
the
same
for
herself
and
her
children
nay
if
you
remember
you
told
me
yourself
that
the
of
thebes
was
built
for
the
philadelphia
service
and
that
i
need
not
move
my
hat
unless
i
wished
till
we
were
there
the
man
did
not
blush
but
answered
in
the
mannered
tone
of
a
subordinate
used
to
obey
here
are
my
orders
sir
telegram
just
received
here
from
headquarters
city
of
thebes
is
to
go
to
baltimore
another
palace
here
sir
waiting
for
you
and
so
we
were
into
such
chairs
and
berths
as
might
have
been
left
in
this
other
palace
as
not
wanted
by
anybody
in
the
great
law
of
natural
selection
and
the
city
of
thebes
went
to
baltimore
i
suppose
the
promises
which
had
been
made
to
us
when
we
bought
our
tickets
went
to
their
place
and
the
people
who
made
them
went
to
theirs
except
for
this
little
incident
of
which
all
my
readers
have
probably
experienced
the
like
in
these
days
of
travel
the
story
i
am
now
to
tell
would
have
seemed
to
me
essentially
improbable
but
so
soon
as
i
reflected
that
in
truth
these
palaces
go
hither
go
thither
controlled
or
not
as
it
may
be
by
some
distant
bureau
the
story
recurred
to
me
as
having
elements
of
vraisemblance
which
i
had
not
noticed
before
having
occasion
nearly
at
the
same
time
to
inquire
at
the
metropolitan
station
in
boston
for
a
lost
shawl
which
had
been
left
in
a
certain
brookline
car
the
gentlemanly
official
told
me
that
he
did
not
know
where
that
car
was
he
had
not
heard
of
it
for
several
days
this
again
reminded
me
of
the
lost
palace
why
should
not
one
palace
more
or
less
go
astray
when
there
are
thousands
to
care
for
indeed
had
not
firth
told
me
at
the
albany
that
the
worst
difficulty
in
the
administration
of
a
strong
railway
is
that
they
can
not
call
their
home
they
go
astray
on
the
line
of
some
weaker
sister
which
finds
it
convenient
to
use
them
till
they
begin
to
show
a
need
for
paint
or
repairs
if
disappear
why
not
palaces
so
the
story
seems
to
me
of
more
worth
and
i
put
it
upon
paper
it
was
on
my
second
visit
to
melbourne
that
i
heard
it
it
was
late
at
night
in
the
of
the
auckland
arms
rather
an
indifferent
house
in
a
in
that
city
to
which
in
truth
i
should
not
have
gone
had
my
finances
been
on
a
better
scale
than
they
were
i
laid
down
at
last
an
old
new
york
herald
which
the
captain
of
the
osprey
had
given
me
that
morning
and
which
in
the
hope
of
i
had
read
and
read
again
to
the
last
syllable
of
the
personals
i
put
down
the
paper
as
one
always
puts
down
an
american
paper
in
a
foreign
land
saying
to
myself
happy
is
that
nation
whose
history
is
unwritten
at
that
moment
sir
roger
tichborne
who
had
been
talking
with
an
american
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
stretched
his
giant
form
and
said
he
believed
he
would
play
a
game
of
billiards
before
he
went
to
bed
he
left
us
alone
and
the
american
crossed
the
room
and
addressed
me
you
are
from
massachusetts
are
you
not
said
he
i
said
i
had
lived
in
that
state
good
state
to
come
from
said
he
i
was
there
myself
for
three
or
four
months
four
months
and
ten
days
precisely
did
not
like
it
very
well
did
not
like
it
at
least
i
liked
it
well
enough
my
wife
did
not
like
it
she
could
not
get
acquainted
does
she
get
acquainted
here
said
i
acting
on
a
principle
which
i
learned
from
scipio
africanus
at
the
latin
school
and
so
carrying
the
war
into
the
regions
promptly
that
is
to
say
i
saw
i
must
talk
with
this
man
and
i
preferred
to
have
him
talk
of
his
own
concerns
rather
than
of
mine
o
sir
i
lost
her
i
lost
her
ten
years
ago
lived
in
new
altoona
then
i
married
this
woman
the
next
autumn
in
vandalia
yes
joslyn
is
very
well
satisfied
here
she
sees
a
good
deal
of
society
and
enjoys
very
good
health
i
said
that
most
people
did
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
have
it
to
enjoy
but
joslyn
did
not
understand
this
bitter
sarcasm
far
less
resent
it
he
went
on
with
sufficient
volubility
to
give
to
me
his
impressions
of
the
colony
of
the
advantages
it
would
derive
from
declaring
its
independence
and
then
from
annexing
itself
to
the
united
states
at
the
end
of
one
of
his
periods
goaded
again
to
say
something
i
asked
why
he
left
his
own
country
for
a
colony
if
he
so
greatly
preferred
the
independent
order
of
government
joslyn
looked
round
somewhat
carefully
shut
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
we
were
now
alone
and
were
likely
at
that
hour
of
the
night
to
be
alone
and
answered
my
question
at
length
as
the
reader
will
see
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
lost
palace
said
he
a
little
anxiously
i
said
no
that
with
every
year
or
two
i
heard
that
layard
had
found
a
palace
at
nineveh
but
that
i
had
never
heard
of
one
being
lost
they
do
tell
of
it
sir
sometimes
i
think
they
do
not
know
themselves
does
not
that
seem
possible
and
the
poor
man
repeated
this
question
with
such
eagerness
that
in
spite
of
my
anger
at
being
bored
by
him
my
heart
really
warmed
toward
him
i
really
think
they
do
not
know
i
have
never
seen
one
word
in
the
papers
about
it
now
they
would
have
put
something
in
the
papers
do
you
not
think
they
would
if
they
knew
it
themselves
they
would
knew
what
said
i
really
startled
out
of
my
determination
to
snub
him
knew
where
the
palace
is
knew
how
it
was
lost
by
this
time
of
course
i
supposed
he
was
crazy
but
a
minute
more
dispelled
that
notion
and
i
beg
the
reader
to
relieve
his
mind
from
it
this
man
knew
perfectly
well
what
he
was
talking
about
and
never
in
the
whole
narration
showed
any
symptom
of
mania
a
matter
on
which
i
affect
to
speak
with
the
intelligence
of
the
experts
indeed
after
a
little
of
this
fencing
with
each
other
in
which
he
satisfied
himself
that
my
ignorance
was
not
affected
he
took
a
sudden
resolution
as
if
it
were
a
relief
to
him
to
tell
me
the
whole
story
it
was
years
on
years
ago
said
he
it
was
when
they
first
had
palaces
still
thinking
of
nimrod
palace
and
priam
i
said
that
must
have
been
a
great
while
ago
yes
indeed
said
he
you
would
not
call
them
palaces
now
since
you
have
seen
pullman
and
wagner
but
we
called
them
palaces
then
so
many
glasses
you
know
and
tapestry
carpets
and
gold
boxes
ours
was
the
first
line
that
run
palaces
i
asked
myself
mentally
of
what
metal
were
the
in
semiramis
palace
but
i
said
nothing
our
line
was
the
first
line
that
had
them
we
were
running
our
lightning
express
on
the
alleghanian
we
were
in
opposition
to
everybody
made
close
connections
served
supper
on
board
and
our
passengers
only
were
sure
of
the
at
louis
those
were
the
days
of
you
know
we
introduced
the
palace
feature
on
the
railroad
and
very
successful
it
was
i
was
an
engineer
i
had
a
character
and
the
best
wages
of
any
man
on
the
line
never
put
me
on
a
or
a
lazy
freight
loafer
i
tell
you
no
sir
i
ran
the
expresses
and
nothing
else
and
lay
off
two
days
in
the
week
besides
i
think
i
should
have
thought
of
it
but
for
todhunter
who
was
my
palace
conductor
again
this
it
which
bad
appeared
so
mysteriously
in
what
the
man
said
before
i
asked
no
question
but
listened
really
interested
now
in
the
hope
i
should
find
out
what
it
was
and
this
the
reader
will
learn
he
went
on
in
a
hurried
way
todhunter
was
my
palace
conductor
one
night
he
was
full
and
his
palace
was
hot
and
smelled
bad
of
oil
we
did
not
burn
petroleum
then
well
it
was
a
splendid
full
moon
in
august
and
we
were
coming
down
grade
making
up
the
time
we
had
lost
at
the
brentford
junction
seventy
miles
an
hour
she
ran
if
she
ran
one
todhunter
had
brought
his
cigar
out
on
the
tender
and
was
sitting
by
me
good
lord
it
seems
like
last
week
todhunter
says
to
me
says
he
the
use
of
crooking
all
round
these
valleys
when
it
would
be
so
easy
to
go
across
you
see
we
were
just
beginning
to
crook
round
so
as
to
make
that
long
bend
there
is
at
chamoguin
but
right
across
the
valley
we
could
see
the
stern
lights
of
fisher
train
it
was
not
more
than
half
a
mile
away
but
we
should
run
eleven
miles
before
we
came
there
i
knew
what
joslyn
meant
to
cross
the
mountain
ranges
by
rail
the
engineers
are
obliged
to
wind
up
one
side
of
a
valley
and
then
boldly
crossing
the
head
of
the
ravine
on
a
high
arch
to
wind
up
the
other
side
still
so
that
perhaps
half
an
hour
journey
is
consumed
while
not
a
mile
of
real
distance
is
made
joslyn
took
out
his
pencil
and
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
drew
a
little
sketch
of
the
country
which
as
it
happened
i
still
preserve
and
which
with
his
comments
explains
his
whole
story
completely
here
we
are
said
he
this
black
line
is
the
great
alleghanian
double
track
seventy
pounds
to
the
yard
no
figuring
off
there
i
tell
you
this
was
a
good
straight
run
down
grade
a
hundred
and
feet
on
the
mile
there
where
i
make
this
x
we
came
on
the
chamoguin
valley
and
turned
short
nearly
north
so
we
ran
wriggling
about
till
drums
here
where
we
stopped
if
they
showed
lanterns
what
we
call
a
station
but
there
we
got
across
the
valley
and
worked
south
again
to
this
other
x
which
was
as
i
say
not
of
a
mile
from
this
x
above
though
it
had
taken
us
eleven
miles
to
get
there
he
had
said
it
was
not
more
than
half
a
mile
but
this
grew
to
as
he
became
more
accurate
and
serious
well
said
he
now
resuming
the
thread
of
his
story
it
was
todhunter
put
it
into
my
head
he
owns
he
did
todhunter
says
says
he
what
the
use
of
crooking
round
all
these
valleys
when
it
would
be
so
easy
to
go
across
well
sir
i
saw
it
then
as
clear
as
i
see
it
now
when
that
trip
was
done
i
had
two
days
to
myself
one
was
sunday
and
todhunter
had
the
same
and
he
came
round
to
my
house
his
wife
knew
mine
and
we
liked
them
well
we
fell
talking
about
it
and
i
got
down
the
cyclopaedia
and
we
found
out
there
about
the
speed
of
and
the
direction
they
had
to
give
them
you
know
this
was
only
talk
then
we
never
thought
what
would
come
of
it
but
very
curious
it
all
was
and
here
joslyn
went
into
a
long
mathematical
talk
with
which
i
will
not
harass
the
reader
perfectly
sure
from
other
experiments
which
i
have
tried
with
other
readers
that
this
reader
would
skip
it
all
if
it
were
written
down
stated
very
briefly
it
amounted
to
this
in
the
experiments
of
those
days
a
travelled
four
thousand
and
one
hundred
feet
in
nine
seconds
now
joslyn
was
convinced
like
every
other
engineman
i
ever
talked
to
that
on
a
steep
he
could
drive
a
train
at
the
rate
of
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
this
is
thirteen
hundred
and
fourteen
feet
in
nine
seconds
almost
exactly
of
the
velocity
at
those
rates
if
the
valley
at
chamoguin
were
really
but
of
a
mile
wide
the
would
cross
it
in
seven
or
eight
seconds
and
the
train
in
about
seconds
both
todhunter
and
joslyn
were
good
enough
mechanics
and
machinists
to
know
that
the
rate
for
hundred
feet
the
width
of
the
valley
was
not
quite
the
same
as
that
for
four
thousand
feet
for
which
in
their
book
they
had
the
calculations
and
formulas
but
they
also
knew
that
the
difference
was
to
their
advantage
or
the
advantage
of
the
bold
experiment
which
had
occurred
to
both
of
them
when
todhunter
had
made
on
the
tender
his
very
critical
suggestion
the
reader
has
already
conceived
the
idea
of
this
experiment
these
rash
men
were
wondering
already
whether
it
were
not
possible
to
leap
an
engine
flying
over
the
chamoguin
ravine
as
eclipse
or
flying
childers
might
have
leaped
the
brook
at
the
bottom
of
it
joslyn
believed
implicitly
as
i
found
in
talk
with
him
the
received
statement
of
conversation
that
eclipse
at
a
single
bound
sprang
forty
feet
if
eclipse
who
weighed
perhaps
one
thousand
two
hundred
would
spring
forty
feet
could
not
my
train
weighing
two
hundred
tons
spring
a
hundred
times
as
far
asked
he
triumphantly
at
least
he
said
that
he
said
this
to
todhunter
they
went
into
more
careful
studies
of
projectiles
to
see
if
it
could
or
could
not
the
article
on
gunnery
gave
them
just
one
of
those
convenient
tables
which
are
the
blessing
of
wise
men
and
learned
men
and
which
lead
men
to
their
ruin
they
found
that
for
their
range
which
was
as
they
supposed
eleven
hundred
yards
the
elevation
of
a
pounder
was
one
degree
and
a
third
of
a
pounder
three
degrees
the
elevation
for
a
railway
train
alas
no
man
had
calculated
but
this
had
occurred
to
both
of
them
from
the
beginning
in
descending
the
grade
at
the
spot
where
on
his
little
map
joslyn
made
the
more
westerly
x
they
were
more
than
eleven
hundred
feet
above
the
spot
where
he
had
made
his
second
or
easterly
x
all
this
descent
was
to
the
advantage
of
the
experiment
a
gunner
would
have
said
that
the
first
x
commanded
the
second
x
and
that
a
battery
there
would
inevitably
silence
a
battery
at
the
point
below
we
need
not
figure
on
it
said
todhunter
as
joslyn
called
them
in
to
supper
if
we
did
we
should
make
a
mistake
give
me
your
papers
when
i
go
up
monday
night
i
give
them
to
my
brother
bill
i
shall
pass
him
at
faber
mills
he
has
studied
all
these
things
of
course
and
he
will
like
the
fun
of
making
it
out
for
us
so
they
sat
down
to
waffles
and
but
for
bill
todhunter
this
story
would
never
have
been
told
to
me
nor
would
john
joslyn
and
this
woman
ever
have
gone
to
australia
but
bill
todhunter
was
one
of
those
acute
men
of
whom
the
new
civilization
of
this
country
is
raising
thousands
with
every
year
who
in
the
midst
of
hard
and
a
daily
duty
which
to
collegians
and
to
the
ignorant
men
among
their
professors
seems
repulsive
carry
on
careful
scientific
study
read
the
best
results
of
the
latest
inquiry
manage
to
bring
together
a
library
of
reference
never
spend
a
cent
for
liquor
or
tobacco
never
waste
an
hour
at
a
circus
or
a
ball
but
make
their
wives
happy
by
sitting
all
the
evening
figuring
one
side
of
the
table
while
the
wife
is
hemming
napkins
on
the
other
all
of
a
sudden
when
such
a
man
is
wanted
he
steps
out
and
bridges
the
gulf
of
bothnia
and
people
wonder
who
forget
that
for
two
centuries
and
a
half
the
foresighted
men
and
women
of
this
country
have
been
building
up
in
the
face
of
the
devil
of
selfishness
on
the
one
hand
and
of
the
pope
of
rome
on
the
other
a
system
of
popular
education
improving
every
hour
at
this
moment
bill
todhunter
was
foreman
of
repair
section
no
ii
on
the
great
alleghanian
a
position
which
needed
a
man
of
promptness
of
great
resource
of
good
education
in
engineering
such
a
man
had
the
great
alleghanian
found
in
him
by
good
luck
and
they
had
promoted
him
to
their
and
section
the
section
on
which
as
it
happened
was
this
chamoguin
run
and
the
long
bend
which
i
have
described
by
which
the
road
headed
that
stream
the
younger
todhunter
did
meet
his
brother
at
mills
where
the
had
hauled
out
of
the
way
of
the
express
and
where
the
express
took
wood
the
brothers
always
looked
for
each
other
on
such
occasions
and
bill
promised
to
examine
the
paper
which
joslyn
had
carefully
written
out
and
which
his
brother
brought
to
him
i
have
never
repeated
in
detail
the
mass
of
calculations
which
bill
todhunter
made
on
the
suggestion
thus
given
to
him
if
i
had
i
would
not
repeat
them
here
for
a
reason
which
has
been
suggested
already
he
became
fascinated
with
the
problem
presented
to
him
stated
in
the
language
of
the
craft
it
was
this
given
a
moving
body
with
a
velocity
eight
thousand
eight
hundred
feet
in
a
minute
what
should
be
its
elevation
that
it
may
fall
eleven
hundred
feet
in
the
transit
of
of
a
mile
he
had
not
only
to
work
up
the
parabola
comparatively
simple
but
he
had
to
allow
for
the
resistance
of
the
air
on
the
supposition
of
a
calm
according
to
the
really
admirable
formulas
of
robins
and
coulomb
which
were
the
best
be
had
access
to
joslyn
brought
me
one
day
a
letter
from
bill
todhunter
which
shows
how
carefully
he
went
into
this
intricate
inquiry
unfortunately
for
them
all
it
took
possession
of
this
spirited
and
accomplished
young
man
you
see
he
not
only
had
the
mathematical
ability
for
the
calculation
of
the
fatal
curve
but
as
had
been
ordered
without
any
effort
of
his
he
was
in
precisely
the
situation
of
the
whole
world
for
trying
in
practice
his
own
great
experiment
at
each
of
the
two
x
x
of
joslyn
map
the
company
had
as
it
happened
switches
for
or
had
it
not
bill
todhunter
had
ample
power
to
make
them
for
the
experiment
all
that
was
necessary
was
that
under
the
pretext
of
these
switches
he
should
lay
out
that
at
the
upper
x
so
that
it
should
run
on
the
exact
grade
which
he
required
to
the
western
edge
of
the
ravine
in
a
line
which
should
be
the
direct
continuation
of
the
long
straight
run
with
which
the
little
map
begins
an
engine
then
running
down
that
grade
at
the
immense
rapidity
practicable
there
would
take
the
switch
with
its
full
speed
would
fly
the
ravine
at
precisely
the
proper
slopes
and
if
the
switch
had
been
rightly
aligned
would
land
on
the
similar
switch
at
the
lower
x
it
would
come
down
exactly
right
on
the
track
as
you
sit
precisely
on
a
chair
when
you
know
exactly
how
high
it
is
if
and
why
should
it
not
be
rightly
aligned
if
bill
todhunter
himself
aligned
it
this
he
was
well
disposed
to
do
he
also
would
align
the
lower
switch
that
at
the
lower
x
that
it
might
receive
into
its
willing
embrace
the
engine
on
its
arrival
when
the
bold
engineer
had
conceived
this
plan
it
was
he
who
pushed
the
others
on
to
it
not
they
who
urged
him
they
were
at
work
on
their
daily
duty
sometimes
did
not
meet
each
other
for
a
day
or
two
bill
todhunter
did
not
see
them
more
than
once
in
a
fortnight
but
whenever
they
did
meet
the
thing
seemed
to
be
taken
more
and
more
for
granted
at
last
joslyn
observed
one
day
as
he
ran
down
that
there
was
a
large
at
the
switch
above
drums
and
he
could
see
bill
todhunter
in
his
broad
sombrero
directing
them
all
joslyn
was
not
surprised
somehow
when
he
came
to
the
lower
switch
to
find
another
there
the
next
time
they
all
three
met
bill
todhunter
told
them
that
all
was
ready
if
they
were
he
said
that
he
had
left
a
few
birches
to
screen
the
line
of
the
upper
switch
for
fear
some
nervous
bungler
driving
an
engine
down
might
be
frightened
and
blow
about
the
switch
but
he
said
that
any
night
when
the
others
were
ready
to
make
the
fly
he
was
that
there
would
be
a
full
moon
the
next
wednesday
and
if
there
was
no
wind
he
hoped
they
would
do
it
then
you
know
said
poor
joslyn
describing
it
to
me
i
should
never
have
done
it
alone
august
would
never
have
done
it
alone
no
i
do
not
think
that
bill
todhunter
himself
would
have
done
it
alone
but
our
heads
were
full
of
it
we
had
thought
of
it
and
thought
of
it
till
we
did
not
think
of
much
else
and
here
was
everything
ready
and
neither
of
us
was
afraid
and
neither
of
us
chose
to
have
the
others
think
he
was
afraid
i
did
say
what
was
the
truth
that
i
had
never
meant
to
try
it
with
a
train
i
had
only
thought
that
we
should
apply
to
the
supe
and
that
he
would
get
up
a
little
excursion
party
of
gentlemen
editors
you
know
and
stockholders
who
would
like
to
do
it
together
and
that
i
should
have
the
pleasure
and
honor
of
taking
them
over
but
todhunter
poohed
at
that
he
said
all
the
calculations
were
made
for
the
inertia
of
a
full
train
that
that
was
what
the
switch
was
graded
for
and
that
everything
would
have
to
be
altered
if
any
part
of
the
plan
were
altered
besides
he
said
the
superintendent
would
never
agree
that
he
would
insist
on
consulting
the
board
and
the
chief
engineer
and
that
they
would
fiddle
over
it
till
christmas
said
bill
wednesday
or
never
if
you
will
not
do
it
then
i
will
put
the
tracks
back
again
august
todhunter
said
nothing
but
i
knew
he
would
do
what
we
agreed
to
and
he
did
so
at
last
i
said
i
would
jump
it
on
wednesday
night
if
the
night
was
fine
but
i
had
just
as
lief
own
to
you
that
i
hoped
it
would
not
be
fine
todhunter
bill
todhunter
i
mean
was
to
leave
the
switch
open
after
the
freight
had
passed
and
to
drive
up
to
the
widow
jones
cross
road
there
he
would
have
a
lantern
and
i
would
stop
and
take
him
up
he
had
a
right
to
stop
us
as
chief
of
repairs
then
we
should
have
seven
miles
to
get
up
our
speed
and
then
we
should
see
ingham
i
might
have
spared
myself
the
hoping
for
foul
weather
it
was
the
finest
moonlight
night
that
you
ever
knew
in
october
and
if
bill
todhunter
had
weighed
that
train
himself
he
could
not
have
been
better
pleased
one
one
two
regular
and
two
palaces
she
run
just
as
steady
as
an
old
cow
we
came
to
the
widow
jones
square
on
time
and
there
was
bill
lantern
waving
i
slowed
the
train
he
jumped
on
the
tender
without
stopping
it
i
brakes
again
and
then
i
told
flanagan
my
fireman
to
go
back
to
the
and
see
if
they
would
lend
me
some
tobacco
you
see
we
wanted
to
talk
and
we
did
want
him
to
see
todhunter
and
i
will
feed
her
till
you
come
back
says
i
to
flanagan
in
a
minute
after
he
had
gone
august
todhunter
came
forward
on
the
engine
and
i
tell
you
she
did
fly
too
fast
said
bill
too
fast
too
fast
is
as
bad
as
too
slow
you
fear
me
says
i
guess
i
know
this
road
and
this
engine
take
out
your
watch
and
time
the
says
i
and
he
timed
them
seconds
says
he
and
a
half
three
times
as
we
passed
the
posts
just
as
regular
as
an
old
clock
and
then
we
came
right
on
the
you
know
at
old
flander
says
bill
again
and
then
she
took
the
switch
i
can
hear
that
ring
under
us
now
ingham
and
then
we
were
clear
was
it
grand
the
range
was
a
little
bit
up
you
see
at
first
but
it
seemed
as
if
we
were
flying
just
straight
across
all
the
rattle
of
the
rail
stopped
you
know
though
the
pistons
worked
just
as
true
as
ever
neither
of
us
said
one
word
you
know
and
she
just
flew
well
as
you
see
a
hawk
fly
sometimes
when
he
pounces
you
know
only
she
flew
so
straight
and
true
i
think
you
may
have
dreamed
of
such
things
i
have
and
now
now
i
dream
it
very
often
it
was
not
half
a
minute
you
know
but
it
seemed
a
good
long
time
i
said
nothing
and
they
said
nothing
only
bill
just
squeezed
my
hand
and
just
as
i
knew
we
must
be
half
over
for
i
could
see
by
the
star
i
was
watching
ahead
that
we
were
not
going
up
but
were
falling
again
do
you
think
the
rope
by
my
side
tightened
quick
and
the
old
bell
on
the
engine
gave
one
savage
bang
turned
right
over
as
far
as
the
catch
would
let
it
and
stuck
where
it
turned
just
that
one
sound
everything
else
was
still
and
then
she
landed
on
the
rails
perhaps
seventy
feet
inside
the
ravine
took
the
rails
as
true
and
sweet
as
you
ever
saw
a
ship
take
the
water
hardly
touched
them
you
know
skimmed
well
as
i
have
seen
a
swallow
skim
on
the
sea
the
prettiest
well
the
tenderest
touch
ingham
that
ever
i
did
see
and
i
could
just
hear
the
connecting
rods
tighten
the
least
bit
in
the
world
behind
me
and
we
went
right
on
we
just
looked
at
each
other
in
the
faces
and
we
could
not
speak
no
i
do
not
believe
we
spoke
for
three
quarters
of
a
minute
then
august
said
not
that
grand
will
they
let
us
do
it
always
bill
but
we
could
not
talk
then
flanagan
came
back
with
the
tobacco
and
i
had
just
the
wit
to
ask
him
why
he
had
been
gone
so
long
poor
fellow
he
was
frightened
enough
when
we
pulled
up
at
clayville
and
he
thought
it
was
drums
drums
you
see
was
way
up
the
bend
a
dozen
miles
above
clayville
poor
flanagan
thought
we
must
have
passed
there
while
he
was
skylarking
in
the
car
and
that
he
had
not
minded
it
we
never
stopped
at
drums
unless
we
had
passengers
or
they
it
was
what
we
call
a
so
i
blew
flanagan
up
and
told
him
he
was
gone
too
long
well
sir
at
clayville
we
did
stop
always
stopped
there
for
wood
august
todhunter
he
was
the
palace
conductor
he
went
back
to
look
to
his
passengers
bill
stayed
with
me
but
in
a
minute
august
came
running
back
and
called
me
off
the
engine
he
led
me
forward
where
it
was
dark
but
i
could
see
as
we
went
that
something
was
to
pay
the
minute
we
were
alone
he
says
we
lost
the
rear
palace
fool
me
august
says
i
fooling
john
says
he
shackle
parted
the
cord
parted
and
is
flying
loose
behind
now
if
you
want
to
see
come
and
count
the
cars
the
general
fremont
is
here
all
right
but
i
tell
you
the
james
buchanan
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
chamoguin
creek
i
walked
back
to
the
other
end
of
the
platform
as
fast
as
i
could
go
and
not
be
minded
todhunter
was
there
before
me
tying
up
the
loose
end
of
the
there
was
a
bit
of
the
broken
end
of
the
shackle
twisted
in
with
the
bolt
i
pulled
the
bolt
and
threw
the
iron
into
the
swamp
far
as
i
could
fling
her
then
i
nodded
to
todhunter
and
walked
forward
just
as
that
old
goose
at
clayville
had
got
his
trousers
on
so
he
could
come
out
and
ask
me
if
we
were
not
ahead
of
time
i
tell
you
sir
i
did
not
stop
to
talk
with
him
i
just
rang
aboard
and
started
her
again
and
this
time
i
run
slow
enough
to
save
the
time
before
we
came
down
to
steuben
we
were
on
time
all
right
there
here
poor
joslyn
stopped
a
while
in
his
story
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
so
wrought
up
with
excitement
that
i
had
better
not
interrupt
either
with
questions
or
with
sympathy
he
rallied
in
a
minute
or
two
and
said
i
thought
we
all
thought
that
there
would
be
a
despatch
somewhere
waiting
us
but
no
all
was
as
regular
as
the
clock
one
palace
more
or
less
what
did
they
know
and
what
did
they
care
so
daylight
came
we
could
not
say
a
word
you
know
with
flanagan
there
and
we
only
stopped
you
know
a
minute
or
two
every
hour
and
just
then
was
when
august
todhunter
had
to
be
with
his
passengers
you
know
was
not
i
glad
when
we
came
into
pemaquid
our
road
ran
from
pemaquid
across
the
mountains
to
eden
you
know
when
we
came
into
pemaquid
and
nobody
had
asked
any
questions
i
reported
my
time
at
the
office
of
the
master
of
trains
and
i
went
home
i
tell
you
ingham
i
have
never
seen
pemaquid
station
since
that
day
i
had
done
nothing
wrong
of
course
i
had
obeyed
every
order
and
minded
every
signal
but
still
i
knew
public
opinion
might
be
against
me
when
they
heard
of
the
loss
of
the
palace
i
did
not
feel
very
well
about
it
and
i
wrote
a
note
to
say
i
was
not
well
enough
to
take
my
train
the
next
night
and
i
and
joslyn
went
to
new
york
and
i
went
aboard
a
collins
steamer
as
fireman
and
joslyn
she
went
as
stewardess
and
i
wrote
to
pemaquid
and
gave
up
my
place
it
was
a
good
place
too
but
i
gave
it
up
and
i
left
america
bill
todhunter
he
resigned
his
place
too
that
same
day
though
that
was
a
good
place
he
is
in
the
russian
service
now
he
is
running
their
line
from
archangel
to
astrachan
good
pay
he
says
but
lonely
august
would
not
stay
in
america
after
his
brother
left
and
he
is
now
captain
clerk
on
the
harkaway
steamers
between
bangkok
and
cochbang
good
place
he
says
but
hot
so
we
are
all
parted
and
do
you
know
sir
never
one
of
us
ever
heard
of
the
lost
palace
sure
enough
under
that
very
curious
system
of
responsibility
by
which
one
corporation
owns
the
carriages
which
another
corporation
uses
nobody
in
the
world
has
to
this
moment
ever
missed
the
lost
palace
on
each
connecting
line
everybody
knew
that
she
was
not
there
but
no
one
knew
or
asked
where
she
was
the
descent
into
the
rocky
bottom
of
the
chamouin
more
than
fifteen
hundred
feet
below
the
line
of
flight
had
of
course
been
rapid
slow
at
first
but
in
the
end
rapid
in
the
first
second
the
lost
palace
had
fallen
sixteen
feet
in
the
second
in
the
third
one
hundred
and
in
the
fourth
two
hundred
and
in
the
fifth
four
hundred
feet
so
that
it
must
have
been
near
the
end
of
the
sixth
second
of
its
fall
that
with
a
velocity
now
of
more
than
six
hundred
feet
in
a
second
the
falling
palace
with
its
unconscious
passengers
fell
upon
the
rocks
at
the
bottom
of
the
chamoguin
ravine
in
the
dead
of
night
wholly
without
jar
or
parting
those
passengers
must
have
been
sleeping
soundly
and
it
is
impossible
therefore
on
any
calculation
of
human
probability
that
any
one
of
them
can
have
been
waked
an
instant
before
the
complete
destruction
of
the
palace
by
the
sudden
shock
of
its
fall
upon
the
bed
of
the
stream
to
them
the
accident
if
it
is
fair
to
call
it
so
must
have
been
wholly
free
from
pain
the
tangles
of
that
ravine
and
the
swamp
below
it
are
such
that
i
suppose
that
even
the
most
adventurous
huntsman
never
finds
his
way
there
on
the
only
occasion
when
i
ever
met
jules
verne
he
expressed
a
desire
to
descend
there
from
one
of
his
balloons
to
learn
whether
the
inhabitants
of
the
lost
palace
might
not
still
survive
and
be
living
in
a
happy
republican
colony
there
a
place
without
railroads
without
telegrams
without
mails
and
certainly
without
palaces
but
at
the
moment
when
these
sheets
go
to
press
no
account
of
such
an
adventure
has
appeared
from
his
rapid
pen
linwood
street
a
christmas
story
a
gray
morning
the
deck
wet
the
iron
all
beaded
with
frost
all
the
longshoremen
in
heavy
or
cardigans
the
whole
ship
in
a
bustle
and
the
favored
passengers
just
leaving
one
irish
girl
stands
with
her
knit
hood
already
spotted
with
the
rime
and
you
can
not
tell
whether
those
are
tears
which
hang
from
her
black
eyelashes
or
whether
the
fog
is
beginning
to
freeze
there
what
you
see
is
that
the
poor
thing
looks
right
and
left
and
up
the
pier
and
down
the
pier
and
that
in
the
whole
crowd
they
all
seem
so
selfish
she
sees
nobody
hundreds
of
people
going
and
coming
pushing
and
hauling
and
nora
big
brother
is
not
there
as
he
promised
to
be
and
should
be
ohstrom
the
motherly
swedish
woman
who
has
four
children
and
ten
tin
cups
and
a
great
bed
and
five
trunks
and
a
fatuous
feckless
husband
makes
time
between
cousins
and
uncles
and
men
and
sharpers
to
run
up
every
now
and
then
to
say
that
nora
must
not
cry
that
she
must
be
easy
that
she
has
spoken
to
the
master
and
the
master
has
said
they
are
three
hours
earlier
than
they
were
expected
and
all
this
was
so
kindly
meant
and
so
kindly
said
that
poor
nora
brushed
the
tears
away
if
they
were
tears
and
thanked
her
though
she
did
not
understand
one
word
that
dear
ohstrom
said
to
her
what
is
language
or
what
are
words
after
all
and
the
daintily
dressed
little
ship
doctor
whom
poor
nora
hardly
knew
in
his
shore
finery
he
made
time
to
stop
and
tell
her
that
the
ship
was
too
early
and
that
she
must
not
worry
father
was
it
she
was
waiting
for
oh
brother
oh
he
will
be
sure
to
be
here
better
sit
down
here
is
a
chair
do
cry
i
am
afraid
you
had
no
breakfast
take
this
orange
it
will
cheer
you
up
i
shall
see
you
again
alas
the
little
doctor
was
swept
away
and
forgot
nora
for
a
week
and
she
was
left
lamenting
for
one
hour
went
by
and
two
and
three
the
swedish
woman
went
and
the
doctor
went
and
the
girl
could
see
the
captain
go
and
the
mate
that
gave
them
their
orders
every
morning
the
people
began
to
go
the
cabs
and
other
carriages
for
the
gentry
had
gone
long
before
and
poor
nora
was
left
lamenting
then
was
it
that
that
queer
salvation
army
girl
with
a
for
a
bonnet
came
up
again
she
had
smiled
pleasantly
two
or
three
times
before
and
had
asked
nora
to
eat
a
bun
poor
nora
broke
down
and
cried
heartily
this
time
but
the
other
was
patient
and
kind
and
said
just
what
the
others
had
said
only
she
did
not
go
away
and
she
had
the
sense
to
ask
if
nora
knew
where
the
brother
lived
why
of
course
i
do
miss
see
here
is
the
paper
and
the
little
soldier
lass
read
it
linwood
street
boston
my
poor
child
what
a
pity
you
did
not
let
us
see
it
before
alas
and
alas
nora
box
was
of
the
biggest
but
the
army
lass
flinched
at
nothing
an
immense
wagon
with
two
giant
horses
loaded
with
the
most
extraordinary
chests
which
have
been
seen
since
the
days
of
the
vikings
piled
on
the
top
were
many
and
on
the
top
of
the
a
scandinavian
matron
with
mike
the
teamster
who
was
at
once
captain
and
pilot
of
this
craft
the
army
lass
had
easily
made
her
treaty
when
he
was
told
the
story
he
was
to
carry
nora
and
her
outfit
to
the
linwood
street
house
after
he
had
taken
these
swedes
to
theirs
and
indade
it
will
not
be
farr
miss
there
a
shorrt
cut
behind
egan
if
indade
he
did
not
put
up
a
tinimint
house
since
i
was
that
way
and
with
new
explanations
to
nora
that
all
was
right
that
indeed
it
was
better
this
way
than
it
would
have
been
had
her
brother
been
called
from
his
work
she
was
lifted
without
much
consent
of
her
own
to
the
driver
seat
and
her
precious
box
was
so
placed
that
she
could
rest
her
little
feet
upon
it
nora
had
proudly
confided
to
the
friendly
lass
the
assurance
that
she
had
money
had
even
shown
a
crisp
bill
which
had
been
sent
to
her
for
exigencies
but
when
the
lass
made
the
contract
with
mike
dermott
the
good
fellow
said
he
should
take
nora
and
her
box
for
the
love
of
county
cork
indade
indade
i
do
take
money
from
the
like
of
her
and
so
they
started
with
the
swedish
men
walking
on
one
side
of
the
cart
with
their
rifles
keeping
a
good
lookout
for
buffaloes
and
red
indians
and
grizzly
bears
as
men
landing
in
a
new
country
which
they
were
to
civilize
more
sailing
for
there
was
the
ferry
to
cross
to
old
boston
much
waiting
for
there
was
a
in
salutation
alley
long
conference
between
nora
and
mike
in
which
he
did
all
the
talking
and
she
all
the
listening
as
to
home
rule
and
mccarthy
and
what
thought
of
this
and
what
cunniff
thought
of
that
then
an
occasional
question
came
in
swedish
from
the
matron
above
their
heads
and
was
followed
by
a
reply
in
celtic
english
from
mike
each
wholly
ignorant
of
the
views
or
wishes
of
the
others
and
occasionally
the
escort
of
riflemen
after
some
particular
attack
of
chaff
in
words
which
they
fortunately
did
not
understand
looked
up
to
their
matron
controller
and
director
exchanged
words
with
her
and
then
studied
the
pavement
again
for
tracks
of
buffalo
a
long
hour
of
all
this
the
stone
and
brick
of
the
city
giving
way
to
green
trees
between
the
houses
as
they
come
to
dorchester
poor
nora
looks
right
and
looks
left
hoping
to
meet
her
big
brother
she
begins
to
think
she
shall
remember
him
everybody
else
looks
so
different
from
fermoy
that
he
must
look
like
home
but
there
is
no
brother
there
is
at
last
a
joyful
cry
as
the
swedish
matron
and
the
riflemen
recognize
familiar
faces
and
mike
smiles
gladly
and
brings
round
the
stout
bays
with
a
twitch
so
that
the
end
of
the
cart
comes
square
to
the
sidewalk
somebody
produces
a
and
the
swedish
matron
with
her
in
her
hand
descends
in
triumph
much
kissing
much
shaking
of
hands
much
thanking
of
god
more
or
less
reverent
then
the
cords
are
cut
beds
flung
down
the
giant
boxes
lifted
the
sons
of
anak
only
know
how
the
money
covenanted
for
is
produced
and
paid
and
mike
mounts
lightly
to
side
and
now
nora
my
child
wherr
is
the
paper
for
in
two
minutes
we
soon
be
therr
now
that
this
rubbish
is
landed
and
he
read
on
the
precious
paper
john
mclaughlin
linwood
street
strange
to
say
the
paper
said
just
what
it
had
said
two
hours
before
and
now
my
dear
child
we
will
be
therr
in
ten
minutes
if
only
we
can
cross
back
of
egan
and
although
they
could
not
cross
back
of
egan
for
egan
had
put
up
a
tinimint
house
since
mike
had
passed
that
way
yet
in
ten
minutes
linwood
street
had
been
found
no
at
last
revealed
itself
between
nos
and
a
great
wooden
with
mysterious
behind
open
doors
in
front
long
passages
running
through
three
doors
on
each
side
of
a
passage
and
the
wondering
heads
of
eleven
women
who
belonged
to
five
different
races
and
spoke
in
six
different
languages
appearing
from
their
eleven
windows
as
mike
and
nora
and
the
two
bays
all
stopped
at
one
and
the
same
moment
at
the
door
mike
was
already
anxious
about
his
time
for
he
was
to
be
at
the
an
hour
away
or
more
at
eleven
sharp
but
he
selected
a
certain
widow
flynn
from
the
eleven
women
he
explained
to
her
briefly
that
john
mclaughlin
was
to
be
found
he
told
nora
for
the
time
that
all
was
right
and
that
she
must
not
cry
he
looked
at
his
watch
again
rather
anxiously
mounted
his
box
and
drove
swiftly
away
he
was
the
one
thread
which
bound
nora
to
this
world
and
this
thread
broke
before
her
eyes
flynn
affected
to
be
cheerful
but
she
was
not
cheerful
flynn
was
a
prominent
person
in
her
sodality
and
well
she
knew
that
if
any
john
mclaughlin
in
those
parts
were
expecting
any
sister
from
home
she
should
know
him
and
where
he
lived
well
she
knew
also
that
john
mclaughlin
the
mason
was
born
in
glasgow
that
john
mclaughlin
who
is
on
the
city
work
had
all
his
family
around
him
and
most
distinct
of
all
she
knew
that
no
mclaughlin
sisterless
or
lived
in
this
beehive
which
she
lived
in
though
it
were
linwood
street
into
her
own
cell
of
that
beehive
however
she
took
poor
sad
desolate
nora
into
the
hallway
she
bade
the
loafing
neighbor
boys
bring
trunk
in
a
language
nora
could
hardly
understand
she
explained
to
her
that
all
would
be
well
as
soon
as
the
policeman
passed
by
she
sent
mary
murphy
who
happened
to
be
at
home
from
school
for
a
pint
of
milk
and
so
compelled
nora
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
and
to
eat
a
biscuit
and
a
dropped
egg
while
they
waited
for
the
policeman
of
course
he
knew
of
seven
john
mclaughlins
he
even
went
to
the
and
looked
in
the
boston
directory
to
find
that
there
were
there
the
names
of
more
but
not
one
of
them
lived
in
linwood
street
as
they
all
knew
already
all
the
same
nora
was
charged
not
to
cry
to
drink
more
tea
and
eat
more
bread
and
butter
the
cop
said
he
would
look
in
on
three
of
the
johns
whom
he
knew
and
intelligent
boys
now
returning
from
school
were
sent
to
the
homes
of
the
other
four
to
interrogate
them
as
to
any
expected
sister
within
an
hour
now
nearly
one
answers
were
received
from
all
the
seven
no
one
of
them
expected
chick
or
child
from
fermoy
but
the
cop
had
a
suggestion
to
make
his
pocket
list
of
names
of
streets
revealed
another
linwood
street
in
roxbury
not
this
one
in
dorchester
be
it
known
to
unlearned
readers
who
in
snug
shelter
in
montana
follow
along
this
little
tale
that
roxbury
and
dorchester
are
both
parts
of
that
large
municipality
called
boston
though
no
john
mclaughlin
was
in
the
directory
for
linwood
street
roxbury
was
not
that
the
objective
poor
nora
was
questioned
as
to
roxbury
she
was
sure
she
never
heard
of
it
but
the
clue
was
too
good
to
be
lost
and
the
authority
of
the
friendly
cop
was
too
great
to
be
resisted
he
telephoned
to
the
central
office
that
nora
mclaughlin
just
from
ireland
had
been
found
in
a
fashion
but
that
no
one
knew
where
to
put
her
then
he
stopped
a
milkman
from
braintree
who
delivered
afternoon
milk
for
invalids
was
he
not
going
through
roxbury
of
course
he
was
would
he
not
take
this
lost
child
to
linwood
street
of
course
he
would
milkmen
from
their
profession
have
hearts
warm
toward
children
well
if
he
were
to
take
her
he
had
better
take
her
trunk
too
to
which
illogical
proposal
the
milkman
acceded
on
the
afternoon
route
there
is
so
much
less
milk
to
take
than
there
is
in
the
morning
so
nora
was
lifted
into
the
in
tears
she
kissed
good
flynn
the
boys
and
girls
assembled
to
bid
her
and
even
she
had
a
hope
for
a
few
moments
that
her
troubles
were
at
an
end
at
linwood
street
roxbury
they
were
preparing
for
the
review
club
the
review
club
met
once
a
fortnight
at
two
at
the
house
of
one
or
another
of
the
members
they
first
arranged
the
little
details
of
the
business
then
the
hostess
read
or
made
some
one
read
the
scraps
which
seemed
most
worthy
in
the
reviews
and
magazines
of
the
last
issues
and
at
four
the
husbands
and
brothers
and
neighbors
generally
dropped
in
and
there
was
afternoon
tea
you
are
sure
you
have
cream
enough
ellen
oh
yes

all
kinds
of
tea

chinese
gentlemen
sent
and
be
sure
of
the
chocolate

mrs
bunce
indeed
yes
mum
and
let
me
know
just
before
you
bring
up
the
hot
water
doorbell
rings
there
is
walter
now
no
it
was
walter
she
came
three
minutes
after
but
before
she
came
howells
the
milkman
had
lifted
nora
from
her
seat
as
the
snow
fell
fast
on
the
doorsteps
he
carried
her
carefully
up
to
the
door
and
even
by
the
time
ellen
answered
the
bell
he
had
the
heavy
chest
dragging
it
over
the
snow
by
the
stout
rope
at
one
end
ellen
was
amazed
to
find
this
group
instead
of
walter
she
called
her
mistress
who
heard
realistic
story
with
amazement
not
to
say
amusement
you
poor
dear
child
she
cried
at
once
come
in
where
it
is
dry
john
mclaughlin
no

can
john
mclaughlin
be
ellen
what
is
mike

the
choreman
who
made
the
furnace
fire
and
kept
the
sidewalk
mike
name
mum
i
do
know
mum
mary
will
know
mum
and
for
the
moment
ellen
disappeared
to
find
mary
never
mind
never
mind
come
in
you
poor
child
you
are
very
good
to
bring
her
howells
very
good
indeed
we
will
take
care
of
her
is
it
going
to
storm
howells
thought
it
was
going
to
storm
and
turned
to
go
away
at
that
moment
walter
arrived
the
first
comer
of
the
review
club
and
nora
new
hostess
had
to
turn
to
her
guests
while
ellen
in
the
last
cares
for
the
afternoon
table
had
to
comfort
nora
by
spasms
it
was
left
for
margaret
the
chambermaid
to
pump
out
or
to
screw
out
as
you
choose
the
details
of
the
story
from
the
poor
frightened
waif
who
seemed
more
astray
than
ever
john
mclaughlin
no
nobody
knew
anything
about
him
the
last
choreman
was
named
mcmanus
but
he
went
to
ottawa
three
years
ago
and
while
the
different
facts
and
doubts
were
canvassed
in
the
kitchen
upstairs
they
settled
the
bulgarian
question
the
origin
of
the
natives
of
tasmania
and
the
last
questions
about
realism
only
the
mind
of
the
lady
of
the
house
returned
again
and
again
to
questions
as
to
the
present
residence
of
john
mclaughlin
for
in
spite
of
the
gathering
snow
and
the
prospect
of
more
the
members
of
the
review
club
had
followed
fast
on
walters
and
gathered
in
full
force
the
hostess
though
somewhat
preoccupied
was
courteous
and
ready
only
the
functions
of
the
club
as
they
went
forward
would
be
occasionally
interrupted
thus
she
would
read
aloud
as
in
her
private
duty
bound
peasantry
were
excited
but
were
held
in
check
by
promises
from
stambuloff
the
emissaries
of
the
czar
goodspeed
would
you
mind
reading
on
here
is
the
place
i
see
my
postman
pass
the
window
and
so
moving
quickly
to
the
front
door
she
interviewed
the
faithful
harrington
dressed
heaven
knows
why
in
confederate
uniform
of
gray
for
harrington
had
served
his
four
years
on
the
loyal
side
four
times
a
day
did
harrington
with
his
renew
the
connection
of
this
household
with
the
world
and
other
worlds
dear
harrington
i
thought
you
could
tell
us
here
is
a
girl
named
nora
mclaughlin
and
here
is
her
trunk
both
left
at
the
door
by
the
milkman
and
we
do
not
know
anything
about
where
she
belongs
insufficient
address
asked
harrington
professionally
exactly
all
she
knows
is
that
her
brother
is
named
john
a
great
many
of
them
are
said
harrington
already
writing
on
his
memorandum
book
and
in
his
memory
fixing
the
fact
that
a
large
living
parcel
insufficiently
addressed
had
been
left
at
the
wrong
door
for
john
mclaughlin
also
a
trunk
too
large
for
delivery
by
the
penny
post
i
will
tell
the
other
men
and
if
i
was
you
i
would
send
to
the
police
would
you
mind
telling
the
first
officer
you
meet
i
hate
to
send
my
girls
out
and
so
she
returned
to
bulgaria
but
bulgaria
was
ended
and
conover
handed
her
an
article
on
antarctic
discovery
she
was
again
reading
under
these
circumstances
captain
wilkes
who
had
collected
a
boatload
of
stones
from
the
front
of
the
glacier
when
she
gave
back
the
forum
to
conover
would
you
mind
going
on
just
a
minute
she
said
and
ran
out
to
meet
the
icecream
man
so
soon
as
he
had
left
his
tins
she
said
fridge
would
you
mind
stopping
at
the
dudley
school
as
you
go
home
and
telling
miss
lougee
that
there
is
a
lost
girl
here
etc
good
fridge
was
most
eager
to
help
and
the
hostess
returned
took
the
book
again
and
read
on
with
the
temperature
as
they
observed
it
was
degrees
but
as
the
alcohol
in
their
tins
was
frozen
at
the
moment
there
seemed
reason
to
suspect
the
correctness
of
this
observation
and
a
shiver
passed
over
the
review
club
thus
far
the
powers
of
confusion
and
error
seemed
to
have
been
triumphant
over
poor
nora
or
such
was
the
success
of
that
power
who
uses
these
agencies
if
the
reader
prefer
to
personify
him
but
the
time
had
come
to
turn
his
left
flank
and
to
attack
his
forces
in
the
rear
for
the
postman
now
took
the
field
that
is
to
say
harrington
good
fellow
finished
his
third
delivery
four
good
miles
and
tenths
of
a
furlong
snow
two
inches
deep
three
four
six
before
he
was
done
and
then
returned
to
his
branch
office
to
report
parcel
insufficient
address
linwood
street
jim
what
ever
come
to
that
letter
that
went
to
linwood
street
with
insufficient

six
weeks
ago
linwood

why
of
course
you
know
went
back
to
the
central
office
i
guess
it
did
said
harrington
grimly
so
i
must
go
there
too
this
meant
that
after
harrington
had
gone
his
rounds
again
on
delivery
route
no
four
more
miles
and
tenths
more
of
a
furlong
doorbells
and
only
slit
boxes
snow
now
ranging
from
inches
to
on
the
sidewalks
and
where
there
was
a
chance
for
drifting
when
all
this
was
well
done
so
that
harrington
had
no
more
duties
to
uncle
sam
he
could
take
nora
mclaughlin
work
in
hand
and
thus
defeat
the
prince
of
evil
to
the
central
office
by
a
blocked

or
twice
but
well
at
the

great
light
fell
over
the
eager

not
because
somerville

the

no
but
because
it

can
scarce
forbear
to
cheer
as
for
harrington
he
bids
wraps
his
tartan
around
him
and
is
out
in

again
where

and
you

all
which
harrington
does
he
experiences
one
continual
burst
of
joy
that
his
route
does
not
take
him
through
these
detours
daily
but
his

is
good
for
him
we
have
no

to
describe
his
false
turns
even

would
have
been
useless
in

at

just
as
the
somerville
bells
ring
for

harrington
also
rings
triumphant
at
the
door
of
the
little
cottage
where
his
lantern
has
already
revealed

as
for

special

door
thrown
open
by
a
solid
man
with
curly
red
hair
unshaven
since
sunday
in
his
shirtsleeves
and
with
kerosene
lamp
in
his
hand
are
you
john
mclaughlin
indade
i
am
the
same
and
where
your
sister
nora
the
good
fellow
who
had
been
stern
before
broke
down
and
indade
i
was
saying
to
ellen
it
an
awful
night
for
all
in
the
gale
off
the
coast
in
the
ship
the
holy
virgin
and
the
good
god
take
care
of
they
have
taken
care
of
them
said
harrington
reverently
the
ship
is
safe
in
dock
and
your
sister
nora
is
in
roxbury
at
linwood
street
and
a
broad
grin
lighted
his
face
as
he
spoke
the
words
there
was
joy
in
every
bed
and
at
every
door
of
the
five
rooms
then
john
hastily
donned
coat
cardigan
and
ulster
he
persuaded
harrington
to
drink
a
cup
of
hot
tea
which
was
brewing
on
the
stove
while
the
good
fellow
did
so
and
ate
a
anne
bun
which
mclaughlin
produced
in
triumph
john
was
persuading
hermann
gross
the
expressman
next
door
to
put
the
gray
into
a
light
pung
he
had
for
special
delivery
by
the
time
harrington
went
to
the
door
two
lanterns
were
flitting
about
in
the
yard
behind
the
two
houses
harrington
assisted
in
yoking
the
gray
in
five
minutes
he
and
john
were
defying
the
gale
as
they
sped
across
the
silent
bridge
bound
south
to
roxbury
poor
little
nora
was
asleep
in
the
parlor
on
the
sofa
she
had
begged
and
begged
that
she
need
not
be
put
to
bed
and
by
her
side
her
protector
sat
reading
about
the
antarctic
but
of
a
sudden
harrington
reappeared
is
it
santa
claus
indeed
it
is
beard
hat
coat
all
white
with
snow
and
santa
claus
has
come
for
the
best
present
he
will
deliver
that
evening
dear
little
nora
is
wrapped
in
sealskins
and
other
skins
mauds
and
astrakhan
rugs
she
has
a
hot
brick
at
her
feet
and
pompey
the
dog
is
made
to
lie
over
them
so
john
mclaughlin
no
takes
her
in
triumph
to
linwood
street
that
was
a
christmas
to
be
remembered
and
christmas
morning
after
church
the
brothers
of
patrick
which
was
the
men
society
and
the
sodality
of
anne
which
was
the
women
determined
on
a
great
night
feast
to
celebrate
nora
return
it
was
to
show
how
these
brethren
love
one
another
they
proposed
to
take
the
rink
people
did
use
it
for
skating
in
winter
as
much
as
in
summer
nora
was
to
receive
with
john
mclaughlin
and
his
wife
to
assist
the
other
john
mclaughlins

the
boys
asked
father
mcelroy
to
make
a
speech
to
all

before
the
dancing
began
and
he
said
the
lost
sheep
was
never
lost
she
thought
she
was
lost
in
the
wilderness
but
she
was
at
home
for
she
was
met
by
the
christmas
greeting
of
the
world
into
which
the
dear
lord
was
born
it
may
interest
the
reader
to
know
that
the
important
part
of
this
story
is
true
ideals
chapter
i
in
account
i
have
a
little
circle
of
friends
among
all
my
other
friends
quite
distinct
though
of
them
they
are
four
men
and
four
women
the
husbands
more
in
love
with
their
wives
than
on
the
days
when
they
married
them
and
the
wives
with
their
husbands
these
people
live
for
the
good
of
the
world
to
a
fair
extent
but
much
very
much
of
their
lives
is
passed
together
perhaps
the
happiest
period
they
ever
knew
was
when
in
different
subordinate
capacities
they
were
all
on
the
staff
of
the
same
magazine
then
they
met
daily
at
the
office
lunched
together
perforce
and
could
make
arrangements
for
the
evening
but
to
say
true
things
differ
little
with
them
now
though
that
magazine
long
since
took
wings
and
went
to
a
better
world
their
names
are
felix
and
fausta
carter
frederic
and
mary
ingham
george
and
anna
haliburton
george
and
julia
hackmatack
i
get
the
children
names
wrong
to
their
faces
except
that
in
general
their
name
is
legion
for
they
are
many
so
i
will
not
attempt
them
here
these
people
live
in
very
different
houses
with
very
different
advantages
as
the
world
says
haliburton
has
grown
very
rich
in
the
rag
and
paper
business
rich
enough
to
discard
rag
money
and
believe
in
gold
he
even
spits
at
silver
which
i
am
glad
to
get
when
i
can
frederic
ingham
will
never
be
rich
his
regular
income
consists
in
his
as
a
retired
brevet
officer
in
the
patriot
service
of
garibaldi
of
the
year
for
the
rest
he
invested
his
money
in
the
brick
moon
and
as
i
need
hardly
add
insured
his
life
in
the
late
continental
insurance
company
but
the
inghams
find
just
as
much
in
life
as
the
haliburtons
and
anna
haliburton
consults
polly
ingham
about
the
shade
of
a
flounce
just
as
readily
and
as
eagerly
as
polly
consults
her
about
the
children
dentistry
they
are
all
very
fond
of
each
other
they
get
a
great
deal
out
of
life
these
eight
partly
because
they
are
so
closely
allied
together
just
two
you
see
or
if
they
go
to
ride
they
just
fill
two
carriages
eight
is
such
a
good
number
makes
such
a
nice
perhaps
they
see
a
little
too
much
of
each
other
that
we
shall
never
know
they
got
a
great
deal
of
life
and
yet
they
were
not
satisfied
they
found
that
out
very
queerly
they
have
not
many
standards
ingham
does
take
the
spectator
hackmatack
condescends
to
read
the
evening
post
haliburton
who
used
to
be
in
the
insurance
business
and
keeps
his
old
extravagant
habits
reads
the
advertiser
and
the
transcript
all
of
them
have
the
christian
union
and
all
of
them
buy
harper
weekly
every
separate
week
of
their
lives
they
buy
of
the
boys
instead
of
subscribing
they
think
they
may
not
want
the
next
number
but
they
always
do
not
one
of
them
has
read
the
nation
for
five
years
for
they
like
to
keep
in
fact
they
do
not
take
much
stock
in
the
general
organs
of
opinion
and
the
standard
books
you
find
about
are
scandalously
few
the
bible
shakespeare
john
milton
polly
has
dante
julia
has
apology
with
ever
so
many
marks
in
it
one
george
has
owen
felltham
and
the
other
is
strong
on
marcus
aurelius
well
no
matter
about
these
separate
things
the
uniform
books
besides
those
i
named
in
different
editions
but
in
every
house
are
the
arabian
nights
and
robinson
crusoe
hackmatack
has
the
priceless
first
edition
haliburton
has
grandville
the
english
grandville
ingham
has
a
proof
copy
of
the
stothard
carter
has
a
good
copy
of
the
cruikshank
if
you
ask
me
which
of
these
four
i
should
like
best
i
should
say
as
the
laureate
did
when
they
gave
him
his
choice
of
two
kinds
of
cake
both
as
good
as
one
well
robinson
crusoe
being
their
lay
gospel
and
creed
not
to
say
epistle
and
psalter
it
was
not
queer
that
one
night
when
the
election
had
gone
awfully
and
the
men
were
as
blue
as
that
little
porcelain
osiris
of
mine
yonder
who
is
so
blue
that
he
can
not
stand
on
his
feet
it
was
not
queer
i
say
that
they
turned
instinctively
to
robinson
crusoe
for
relief
now
robinson
crusoe
was
once
in
a
very
bad
box
indeed
and
to
comfort
himself
as
well
as
he
could
and
to
set
the
good
against
the
evil
that
he
might
have
something
to
distinguish
his
case
from
worse
he
stated
impartially
like
debtor
and
creditor
the
comforts
and
miseries
thus
evil
good
i
am
cast
upon
a
horrible
but
i
am
alive
and
not
desolate
island
void
of
all
drowned
as
all
my
hope
of
recovery
ship
company
were
i
am
singled
out
and
separated
but
i
am
singled
out
as
it
were
from
all
the
world
to
too
from
the
ship
crew
be
miserable
to
be
spared
from
death
and
so
the
debtor
and
creditor
account
goes
on
julia
hackmatack
read
this
aloud
to
them
the
whole
of
it
and
they
agreed
as
robinson
says
not
so
much
for
their
posterity
as
to
keep
their
thoughts
from
daily
poring
on
their
trials
that
for
each
family
they
would
make
such
a
balance
what
might
not
come
of
it
perhaps
a
partial
nay
perhaps
a
perfect
cure
so
they
determined
that
on
the
instant
they
would
go
to
work
and
two
in
the
two
in
the
room
two
in
george
study
and
two
in
the
parlor
they
should
in
the
next
halfhour
make
up
their
lists
of
good
and
evil
here
are
the
results
frederic
and
mary
ingham
good
evil
we
have
three
nice
boys
but
the
rings
all
and
three
nice
girls
the
time
we
have
enough
to
eat
but
the
coal
bill
is
awful
drink
and
wear
and
the
larrabee
furnace
has
given
out
the
firm
that
made
it
has
gone
up
and
no
castings
can
be
got
to
mend
it
we
have
more
books
than
but
our
friends
borrow
our
we
can
read
and
do
not
care
books
and
only
return
odd
to
read
many
newspapers
volumes
we
have
many
very
dear
but
we
are
behindhand
friends
enough
names
on
our
lists
of
calls
we
have
health
in
our
but
the
children
may
be
family
sick
the
lowndes
children
are
we
seem
to
be
of
some
but
hogarth
has
left
use
in
the
world
fred
for
the
poor
and
he
is
afraid
he
shall
spend
it
wrong
the
country
has
gone
to
the
dogs
george
and
anna
haliburton
good
evil
we
have
a
nice
home
in
you
can
not
give
a
cup
of
town
and
one
in
sharon
and
coffee
to
a
beggar
but
he
sends
a
place
at
little
five
hundred
million
tramps
to
gau
and
we
have
friends
the
door
enough
to
fill
them
we
have
some
of
the
nicest
a
great
many
people
call
children
in
the
world
whose
names
we
have
forgotten
we
have
enough
to
do
and
we
have
to
give
a
party
to
not
too
much
all
our
acquaintance
every
year
which
is
horrid
business
is
good
enough
we
do
not
do
anything
we
though
complaining
want
to
do
and
we
do
a
great
deal
that
we
do
not
want
to
do
george
had
added
and
there
is
no
health
in
us
but
anna
marked
that
out
as
wicked
the
children
are
all
well
people
vote
as
if
they
were
possessed
george
and
julia
hackmatack
good
evil
we
have
eight
splendid
the
plumbers
work
always
children
gives
way
at
the
wrong
time
and
the
plumbers
bills
are
awful
we
have
money
enough
the
furnace
will
not
heat
the
though
we
know
what
to
do
house
unless
the
wind
is
at
the
with
more
southwest
none
of
the
chimneys
draw
well
george
will
not
have
to
go
we
hate
the
kydd
school
to
bahia
next
year
the
master
drinks
and
the
first
assistant
lies
but
we
live
in
that
district
so
the
boys
have
to
go
there
tom
got
through
with
scarlet
lucy
said
commence
yesterday
fever
without
being
deaf
jane
said
gent
walter
said
bully
for
you
and
alice
said
nobby
and
what
is
coming
we
do
not
know
witherspoon
has
accepted
how
long
any
man
can
live
the
presidency
of
tiberias
under
this
government
i
do
college
in
alaska
not
know
felix
and
fausta
carter
good
evil
governments
are
stronger
but
as
the
children
grow
every
year
money
goes
farther
bigger
their
clothes
cost
than
it
did
more
all
the
boys
are
good
and
but
the
children
get
no
well
so
are
the
girls
good
at
school
except
they
are
splendid
children
measles
and
scarlet
fever
old
porter
died
last
but
the
lies
week
and
felix
gets
promotion
and
the
gas
company
wants
to
in
the
office
have
it
lie
the
lost
volume
of
fichte
but
the
athenaeum
is
always
was
left
on
the
last
calling
in
its
books
to
examine
night
by
some
one
who
rang
the
them
and
making
us
say
where
bell
and
ran
away
it
is
rather
fred
curtis
books
are
wet
but
when
it
is
bound
will
as
if
we
cared
look
nicely
the
mistress
of
the
arbella
but
our
drains
smell
school
is
dead
awfully
though
the
board
of
health
says
they
do
not
we
have
to
go
to
evening
parties
among
our
friends
or
seem
stuck
up
we
hate
to
go
and
wish
there
were
none
we
had
rather
come
here
the
increasing
worthlessness
of
the
franchise
with
these
papers
they
gathered
all
in
the
study
just
as
the
clock
struck
nine
and
in
good
old
boston
fashion
silas
was
bringing
in
some
hot
oysters
they
ate
the
oysters
which
were
good
trust
anna
for
that
and
then
the
women
read
the
papers
while
the
smoking
men
smoked
and
pondered
they
all
recognized
the
gravity
of
the
situation
still
as
julia
said
they
felt
better
already
it
was
like
having
the
doctor
come
you
knew
the
worst
and
could
make
ready
for
it
they
did
not
discuss
the
statements
much
they
had
discussed
them
too
much
in
severalty
they
did
agree
that
they
should
be
left
to
felix
to
report
upon
the
next
evening
he
was
so
to
speak
to
post
them
to
strike
out
from
each
side
the
quantities
which
could
be
eliminated
and
leave
the
equations
so
simplified
that
the
eight
might
determine
what
they
should
do
about
it
indeed
what
they
could
do
about
it
the
visitors
put
on
their
things
how
strange
that
that
word
should
once
have
meant
parliaments
kissed
so
far
as
they
were
womanly
and
went
home
george
haliburton
screwed
down
the
gas
and
they
went
to
bed
chapter
ii
striking
the
balance
the
next
night
they
went
to
see
warren
at
the
museum
that
probably
helped
them
after
the
play
they
met
by
appointment
at
the
carters
felix
read
his
report
there
are
reasons
for
congratulation
for
regret
but
of
the
four
are
the
same
namely
the
cursed
political
prospect
of
the
country
counting
that
as
one
only
there
are
on
each
side
the
evils
may
be
classified
thus
political
social
physical
terrors
all
the
physical
evils
would
be
relieved
by
living
in
a
temperate
climate
instead
of
this
abomination
which
is
not
a
climate
to
which
our
ancestors
were
sold
by
the
cupidity
of
the
dutch
the
political
evil
would
be
ended
by
leaving
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
the
social
evils
which
are
a
majority
of
all
would
be
reduced
by
residence
in
any
place
where
there
were
not
so
many
people
the
terrors
properly
belong
to
all
the
classes
in
a
decent
climate
in
a
country
not
governed
by
its
vices
and
a
community
not
crowded
the
three
terrors
would
be
materially
abated
if
not
put
to
an
end
respectfully
submitted
felix
carter
how
they
discussed
it
now
talk
i
think
so
they
all
talked
awhile
and
no
one
listened
but
they
had
to
stop
when
phenice
brought
in
the
welsh
good
before
bed
but
a
little
indigestible
unless
your
conscience
is
stainless
and
felix
then
put
in
a
word
now
i
tell
you
this
is
not
nonsense
why
not
do
what
winslow
and
standish
and
those
fellows
thought
they
were
doing
when
they
sailed
why
not
go
to
a
climate
like
france
with
milder
winters
and
cooler
summers
than
here
you
want
some
winter
you
want
some
summer
i
hate
centipedes
and
scorpions
said
anna
there
no
need
of
them
there
a
place
in
mexico
not
a
hundred
miles
from
the
sea
where
you
can
have
your
temperature
just
as
you
like
stuff
no
it
is
not
stuff
at
all
said
poor
felix
eagerly
i
do
not
mean
just
one
spot
but
you
live
in
this
valley
you
know
if
you
find
it
is
growing
hot
you
move
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
another
place
higher
up
if
you
find
that
hot
why
you
have
another
house
a
little
higher
do
you
see
then
when
winter
comes
you
move
down
are
there
many
people
there
asked
haliburton
and
do
they
make
many
calls
there
are
a
good
many
people
but
they
are
a
gentle
set
they
never
quarrel
they
are
a
little
too
high
up
for
the
revolutions
and
there
is
something
tranquillizing
about
the
place
they
seldom
die
none
are
sick
need
no
aguardiente
do
what
the
head
of
the
village
tells
them
to
do
only
he
never
has
any
occasion
to
tell
them
they
never
make
calls
i
like
that
said
ingham
that
patriarchal
system
is
the
true
system
of
government
where
is
this
place
said
anna
incredulously
i
have
been
trying
to
remember
all
day
but
i
ca
it
is
in
mexico
i
know
it
is
on
this
side
of
mexico
it
tells
all
about
it
in
an
old
oh
a
good
many
years
ago
but
i
never
bound
mine
there
are
always
one
or
two
missing
every
year
i
asked
fausta
to
look
for
it
but
she
was
busy
i
thought
continued
poor
felix
a
little
crestfallen
one
of
you
might
remember
no
nobody
remembered
and
nobody
felt
much
like
going
to
the
public
library
to
look
on
carter
rather
vague
indications
in
fact
it
was
a
suggestion
of
haliburton
that
proved
more
popular
haliburton
said
he
had
not
laid
in
his
coal
they
all
said
the
same
now
said
he
the
coal
of
this
crowd
for
this
winter
will
cost
a
thousand
dollars
if
you
add
in
the
kindling
and
the
matches
and
patching
the
furnace
pots
and
sweeping
the
chimneys
to
this
they
agreed
it
is
now
wednesday
let
us
start
saturday
for
memphis
take
a
cheap
boat
to
new
orleans
go
thence
to
vera
cruz
by
steamer
explore
the
ground
buy
the
houses
if
we
like
and
return
by
the
time
we
can
do
without
fires
next
spring
our
board
will
cost
less
than
it
would
here
for
it
is
there
the
beef
comes
from
and
the
thousand
dollars
will
pay
the
fares
both
ways
the
women
with
one
voice
cried
and
the
children
oh
yes
cried
the
eager
adventurer
i
had
forgotten
the
children
well
they
are
all
well
are
they
not
yes
all
were
well
then
we
will
take
them
with
us
as
far
as
yellow
springs
in
ohio
and
leave
them
for
the
fall
and
winter
terms
at
antioch
college
they
will
be
enough
better
taught
than
they
are
at
the
kydd
school
and
they
will
get
no
scarlet
fever
nobody
is
ever
sick
there
they
will
be
better
cared
for
than
my
children
are
when
they
are
left
to
me
and
they
will
be
seven
hundred
miles
nearer
to
us
than
if
they
were
here
the
little
ones
can
go
to
the
model
school
the
middling
ones
to
the
academy
and
the
oldest
can
go
to
college
how
many
are
there
felix
felix
said
there
were
well
said
the
arithmetical
george
it
is
the
cheapest
place
i
ever
knew
why
their
seniors
get
along
for
three
hundred
dollars
a
year
and
squeeze
more
out
of
life
than
i
do
out
of
twenty
thousand
the
little
ones
wo
cost
at
that
rate
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
for
children
how
much
is
that
polly
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
of
course
said
she
i
thought
so
well
do
you
see
we
shall
save
that
in
wages
to
these
servants
we
are
boarding
here
of
whom
there
are
eleven
who
cost
us
say
six
dollars
a
week
that
is
dollars
for
twenty
weeks
is
thirteen
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
we
wo
buy
any
clothes
but
live
on
the
old
ones
and
make
the
children
wear
their
big
brothers
and
sisters
there
a
saving
of
hundred
dollars
for
of
us
why
we
shall
make
money
i
tell
you
what
if
you
do
it
i
pay
all
the
bills
till
we
come
home
if
you
like
you
shall
then
each
pay
me
of
your
last
winter
accounts
and
i
charge
any
difference
to
profit
and
loss
but
i
shall
make
by
the
bargain
the
women
doubted
if
they
could
be
ready
but
it
proved
they
could
still
they
did
not
start
saturday
they
started
monday
in
two
they
left
the
children
all
delighted
with
the
change
at
antioch
on
wednesday
a
little
tempted
to
spend
the
winter
there
themselves
but
this
temptation
well
resisted
they
sped
on
to
mexico
chapter
iii
fulfilment
such
a
tranquil
three
days
on
the
mississippi
which
was
as
an
autumn
flood
and
revealed
himself
as
indeed
king
of
waters
such
delightful
three
days
in
hospitable
new
orleans
might
it
not
be
possible
to
tarry
even
here
no
cried
the
inexorable
george
we
have
put
our
hand
to
the
plough
who
will
turn
back
two
days
of
abject
wretchedness
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
why
were
we
born
why
did
we
not
die
before
we
left
solid
land
and
then
the
at
vera
cruz
lo
land
and
all
was
well
what
a
splendid
city
why
had
nobody
told
them
of
this
queen
on
the
red
and
white
towers
cupolas
battlements
it
was
all
like
a
when
they
landed
to
be
sure
it
was
not
quite
so
big
a
place
as
they
had
fancied
from
all
this
show
but
for
this
they
did
not
care
to
land
that
was
enough
had
they
landed
on
a
they
would
have
been
in
heaven
no
more
swaying
to
and
fro
as
they
lay
in
bed
no
more
stumbling
to
and
fro
as
they
walked
they
refused
the
amazed
mexicans
who
wanted
them
to
ride
to
the
hotel
to
walk
steadily
was
in
itself
a
luxury
and
then
it
was
not
long
before
the
men
had
selected
the
little
caravan
of
horses
and
mules
which
were
to
carry
them
on
their
expedition
of
discovery
some
valley
of
paradise
where
a
man
could
change
his
climate
from
midwinter
to
midsummer
by
a
journey
of
a
mile
did
the
consul
happen
to
have
heard
of
any
such
valley
had
he
heard
of
them
he
had
heard
of
fifty
he
had
not
indeed
heard
of
much
else
how
could
he
help
hearing
of
them
could
the
consul
then
recommend
one
or
two
valleys
which
might
be
for
sale
or
was
it
perhaps
impossible
to
buy
a
foothold
in
such
an
eden
for
sale
there
was
nothing
in
the
country
so
far
as
the
friend
knew
to
whom
the
consul
presented
them
which
was
not
for
sale
anywhere
in
queretaro
or
why
should
they
not
go
to
the
baxio
no
that
was
too
flat
and
too
far
off
there
were
pretty
places
round
xalapa
oh
plenty
of
plantations
for
sale
but
they
need
not
go
so
far
anywhere
on
the
rise
of
chiquihiti
was
the
friend
quite
sure
that
there
were
no
plumbers
in
the
regions
he
named
never
a
plumber
in
mexico
any
men
not
one
the
prudent
friend
did
not
add
risk
too
high
were
the
public
schools
graded
schools
or
district
schools
not
a
public
school
in
six
provinces
would
the
neighbors
be
offended
if
we
do
not
call
cut
your
throats
if
you
did
did
the
friend
think
there
would
be
many
tramps
the
friend
seemed
more
doubtful
here
but
suggested
that
the
occasional
use
of
a
reduced
the
number
and
gave
a
certain
reputation
to
the
premises
where
it
was
employed
which
diminished
much
tramping
afterward
and
said
that
the
law
did
not
object
to
this
method
they
returned
to
a
dinner
of
fish
for
which
vera
cruz
is
celebrated
if
what
the
man
says
be
true
said
ingham
we
must
be
very
near
heaven
it
was
now
in
november
oh
the
glory
of
that
ride
as
they
left
vera
cruz
and
through
a
wilderness
of
color
jogged
slowly
on
to
their
new
paradise
through
eden
four
glad
couples
took
their
way
higher
and
higher
this
wonder
and
that
not
a
blade
of
grass
such
as
they
ever
saw
before
not
a
chirping
cricket
such
as
they
ever
heard
before
a
hundred
birds
and
not
one
that
they
had
ever
seen
before
higher
and
higher
trees
skies
clouds
flowers
beasts
birds
insects
all
new
and
all
lovely
the
final
purchase
was
of
one
small
plantation
with
a
house
large
enough
for
a
little
army
yet
without
a
stair
oranges
lemons
pomegranates
mangoes
bananas
coffee
sugar
what
did
not
ripen
in
those
perennial
gardens
half
a
mile
above
there
were
two
smaller
houses
belonging
to
the
same
estate
half
a
mile
above
another
was
purchased
easily
this
was
too
cold
to
stay
in
in
november
but
in
june
and
july
and
august
the
temperature
would
be
without
change
they
sent
back
the
mules
a
telegram
from
vera
cruz
brought
from
boston
in
fifteen
days
the
best
books
in
the
world
the
best
piano
in
the
world
a
few
boxes
of
colors
for
the
artists
a
few
reams
of
paper
and
a
few
dozen
of
pencils
for
the
men
and
then
began
four
months
of
blessed
life
never
a
nor
a
never
a
crack
in
the
furnace
nor
a
man
to
put
in
coal
never
a
request
to
speak
for
the
benefit
of
the
fenians
never
the
necessity
of
attending
at
a
primary
meeting
the
ladies
found
in
their
walks
these
gentle
mexican
children
simple
happy
civil
and
with
the
strange
idea
that
the
object
for
which
life
is
given
is
that
men
may
live
they
came
home
with
new
wealth
untold
every
day
of
ipomoea
convolvulus
and
orchids
the
gentlemen
brought
back
every
day
a
new
species
even
a
new
genus
a
new
illustration
of
evolution
or
a
new
mystery
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
law
of
natural
selection
night
was
all
sleep
day
was
all
life
digestion
waited
upon
appetite
appetite
waited
upon
exercise
exercise
waited
upon
study
study
waited
upon
conversation
conversation
waited
upon
love
could
it
be
that
november
was
over
can
life
run
by
so
fast
can
it
be
that
christmas
has
come
can
we
let
life
go
by
so
fast
is
it
possible
that
it
is
the
end
of
january
we
can
not
let
life
go
so
fast
really
is
this
valentine
day
when
ever
did
life
go
so
fast
and
with
the
of
march
the
mules
were
ordered
and
they
moved
to
the
next
higher
level
the
men
and
women
walked
and
there
on
the
grade
of
a
new
climate
they
began
on
a
new
botany
on
new
discoveries
and
happy
life
found
new
forms
as
they
began
again
so
sped
april
and
so
sped
may
life
had
its
battles
oh
yes
because
it
was
life
but
they
were
not
the
pettiest
of
battles
they
were
not
the
battles
of
prisoners
shut
up
to
keep
out
the
weather
in
cells
fifteen
feet
square
they
fought
if
they
fought
with
god
air
in
their
veins
and
god
warm
sunshine
around
them
and
god
blue
sky
above
them
so
they
did
what
they
could
as
they
wrote
and
read
and
drew
and
painted
as
they
walked
and
ran
and
swam
and
rode
and
drove
as
they
encouraged
this
peon
boy
and
taught
that
peon
girl
smoothed
this
old
woman
pillow
and
listened
to
that
old
man
story
as
they
analyzed
these
wonderful
flowers
as
they
tasted
these
wonderful
fruits
as
they
climbed
these
wonderful
mountains
or
at
night
as
they
pointed
the
telescope
through
this
cloudless
and
stainless
sky
with
all
their
might
they
lived
and
they
were
so
many
and
there
were
so
many
round
them
to
whom
their
coming
was
a
new
life
that
they
lived
in
love
and
every
day
drank
in
of
the
infinite
elixir
but
june
came
the
mules
are
sent
for
again
again
they
walked
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
here
in
the
little
whitewashed
cottage
with
only
a
selection
from
the
books
below
with
two
guitars
and
a
flute
in
place
of
the
piano
here
they
made
ready
for
three
weeks
of
june
only
three
weeks
for
on
the
was
the
commencement
at
antioch
and
jane
and
walter
and
florence
were
to
take
their
degrees
there
would
need
five
days
from
vera
cruz
to
reach
them
and
so
this
summer
was
to
be
spent
in
the
north
with
them
before
october
should
bring
all
the
children
and
the
parents
to
the
land
of
the
open
sky
three
busy
weeks
between
the
and
the
in
which
all
the
pictures
must
be
finished
novel
must
be
revised
haliburton
articles
completed
the
new
invention
for
measuring
power
must
be
gauged
and
tested
the
dried
flowers
must
be
mounted
and
packed
the
preserved
fruits
must
be
divided
for
the
northern
friends
three
happy
weeks
of
life
eventful
but
life
without
crowding
and
above
all
without
interruption
think
of
it
cried
felix
as
they
took
their
last
walk
among
the
lava
crags
the
has
not
rung
all
this
last
winter
happy
old
king
on
his
gate
he
did
swing
because
there
was
never
a
to
ring
this
was
julia
impromptu
reply
chapter
iv
home
again
so
came
one
more
journey
why
can
we
not
go
and
come
without
this
musty
steamer
these
odious
smells
this
food
for
dogs
and
this
surge
ah
how
remorseless
of
the
cruel
sea
but
even
this
will
end
once
more
the
stars
and
stripes
a
land
of
furnaces
and
of
waterpipes
a
land
of
beggars
and
of
caucuses
a
land
of
and
of
liars
a
land
of
pasteboard
and
of
cards
a
land
of
etiquettes
and
of
bad
spelling
but
still
their
country
a
land
of
telegraphs
which
told
in
an
instant
as
they
landed
on
the
levee
that
all
the
were
well
and
begged
them
to
be
at
the
college
on
tuesday
evening
so
as
to
see
much
ado
about
nothing
for
at
antioch
they
act
a
play
the
night
before
commencement
a
land
of
pullman
and
lo
they
secured
sections
and
and
in
the
mayflower
just
time
to
kiss
the
baby
of
one
friend
and
to
give
a
basket
of
guavas
to
another
and
then
whir
for
cincinnati
and
xenia
and
yellow
springs
how
beautiful
were
the
and
the
magnolias
how
fresh
the
green
of
the
cotton
how
black
the
faces
of
the
little
negroes
and
how
beyond
dispute
the
perfume
of
the
baked
peanuts
at
the
stations
where
sometimes
they
had
to
stop
for
wood
and
water
even
the
heavy
pile
of
smoke
above
cincinnati
was
golden
with
the
hopes
of
a
day
as
they
rushed
up
to
the
ohio
river
and
as
they
crossed
it
and
then
the
land
of
happy
homes
it
was
kapnist
who
said
to
me
that
the
most
favored
places
in
the
world
were
the
larger
villages
in
ohio
he
had
gone
everywhere
too
xenia
and
a
perfect
breakfast
at
the
station
then
the
towers
of
antioch
then
the
children
waving
their
handkerchiefs
as
the
train
rushes
in
how
much
there
was
to
tell
to
show
to
ask
for
and
to
see
how
much
pleasure
they
gave
with
their
cochineal
their
mangoes
their
bananas
their
for
the
boys
and
their
fans
for
the
girls
yes
and
how
much
more
they
took
from
nutbrown
faces
from
smiles
beaming
from
ear
to
ear
from
the
boy
so
tall
that
he
looked
down
upon
his
father
from
the
girl
so
womanly
that
you
asked
if
her
mother
were
not
masquerading
you
rascal
ozro
you
do
not
pretend
that
those
trousers
were
made
for
you
why
my
boy
you
disgrace
the
family
i
hope
not
papa
i
had
in
the
botany
examination
passed
with
honors
in
greek
and
we
beat
the
buckeye
club
to
nothing
in
the
return
match
yesterday
you
did
you
little
beggar
the
proud
papa
replied
you
ran
all
the
better
i
suppose
because
you
had
nothing
to
trip
you
and
so
on
and
so
on
the
children
did
not
live
in
paradise
perhaps
but
this
seems
very
like
the
kingdom
come
and
after
commencements
and
the
president
party
up
to
the
yellow
springs
platform
came
two
unusual
palaces
specially
engaged
and
one
was
named
the
valparaiso
and
the
other
as
it
happened
the
bethlehem
and
they
took
all
the
children
and
by
good
luck
tucker
was
going
also
and
three
or
four
of
the
college
girls
and
they
took
them
so
there
were
in
all
and
they
sped
and
sped
without
change
of
cars
save
as
bethlehem
visited
paradise
and
paradise
visited
bethlehem
till
they
came
to
new
salem
which
is
the
station
men
buy
tickets
for
when
they
would
go
to
the
beach
below
quonochontaug
where
the
eight
and
the
were
to
make
their
summer
home
before
the
final
emigration
they
do
not
live
at
quonochontaug
but
to
that
office
are
their
letters
sent
they
live
in
a
hamlet
of
their
own
known
to
the
neighbors
as
the
little
gau
four
large
houses
whitewashed
without
and
within
with
deep
piazzas
all
around
the
roofs
of
which
join
the
roofs
of
the
houses
themselves
and
run
up
on
all
sides
to
one
point
above
the
centre
in
each
house
a
hall
some
twenty
feet
by
fifty
and
in
the
hall
what
is
not
in
the
hall
maybe
a
piano
maybe
a
maybe
a
rifle
or
a
telescope
a
volume
of
sermons
or
a
volume
of
songs
a
or
a
guitar
or
a
battledore
you
might
ask
widely
for
what
you
needed
for
study
or
for
play
and
you
would
find
it
though
it
were
a
deep
divan
of
osiat
or
a
chibouque
from
stamboul
you
would
find
it
in
one
of
these
simple
whitewashed
halls
little
gau
is
so
near
the
that
every
day
they
go
down
to
the
beach
to
bathe
and
the
beach
is
so
near
the
gulf
stream
that
the
swim
is
well
perfection
still
the
first
day
the
ladies
would
not
swim
they
had
the
trunks
to
open
they
said
and
the
closets
to
arrange
and
the
four
men
and
the
fourteen
boys
went
to
that
bath
of
baths
alone
and
as
felix
the
cynic
grumbler
ran
races
naked
on
the
beach
with
his
boy
and
the
boy
beat
him
even
felix
was
heard
to
say
how
little
man
needs
here
below
to
be
perfectly
happy
and
at
the
little
gau
they
spent
the
months
from
the
fourth
of
july
to
the
of
october
two
great
days
in
history
getting
ready
for
mexico
new
were
bought
and
the
fall
of
the
stream
from
the
lake
was
taught
to
run
the
treadles
no
end
of
clothing
was
got
ready
for
a
country
which
needs
none
no
end
of
memoranda
made
for
the
last
purchases
no
end
of
lists
of
books
prepared
which
they
could
read
in
that
land
of
leisure
and
on
the
of
october
with
a
passing
sigh
they
bade
to
boats
and
dogs
and
cows
and
horses
and
neighbors
and
beaches
almost
to
sun
and
moon
which
had
smiled
on
so
much
happiness
and
went
back
to
boston
to
make
the
last
bargains
to
pay
the
last
bills
and
to
say
the
last
after
one
day
of
and
and
farewelling
they
met
at
ingham
to
tell
their
times
and
julia
told
of
her
farewell
call
on
dear
blake
the
saint
said
she
she
does
not
see
as
well
as
she
did
but
it
was
just
lovely
there
there
was
the
great
bronze
japanese
stork
which
seemed
so
friendly
and
the
great
vases
and
her
flowers
as
fresh
as
ever
and
her
books
everywhere
she
found
something
for
tom
and
maud
to
play
with
just
as
she
used
to
for
ben
and
horace
and
we
sat
and
talked
of
mexico
and
antioch
and
everything
i
asked
her
if
her
eyes
troubled
her
and
i
was
delighted
because
it
seems
they
do
not
trouble
her
at
all
she
told
all
about
swampscott
and
her
grandchildren
i
asked
her
if
the
dust
never
troubled
them
on
gladstone
street
but
she
says
it
does
not
at
all
and
she
told
all
about
her
son
family
in
kong
i
asked
her
if
the
failure
of
rupee
lac
annoyed
them
and
she
said
not
at
all
and
i
was
so
glad
for
i
had
been
so
afraid
for
them
and
then
she
told
about
how
much
they
were
enjoying
macaulay
then
i
asked
her
if
the
new
anvil
factory
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
did
not
trouble
her
and
she
said
not
at
all
and
when
i
said
can
that
be
she
said
julia
dear
we
do
not
let
these
things
trouble
us
do
you
see
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
let
such
things
trouble
me
george
haliburton
laid
down
his
knife
as
julia
told
the
story
do
you
remember
rabia
at
mecca
yes
they
all
remembered
rabia
at
mecca
oh
heart
weak
follower
of

thou
shouldst
traverse
land
and
sea
in
this
far
place
that
god
to
seek
who
long
ago
had
come
to
thee
why
should
we
not
stay
here
and
not
let
these

trouble
us
why
not
indeed
and
they
stayed
one
cent
a
christmas
story
down
starr
rose
very
early
that
day
the
sun
was
not
up
yet
certainly
it
was
too
light
to
strike
a
match
ah
starr
a
match
may
be
an
economy
so
it
was
that
when
as
always
the
keys
jingled
out
from
his
trousers
pockets
upon
the
floor
and
the
money
as
well
one
cent
rolled
under
the
bureau
unseen
by
starr
he
went
down
to
his
work
now
after
he
had
gathered
up
the
rest
of
the
money
and
the
keys
and
answered
yesterday
letters
then
of
course
he
could
loiter
over
his
breakfast
but
not
too
long
clara
his
wife
was
in
good
spirits
and
the
boys
were
very
jolly
but
starr
all
the
same
did
the
duty
next
his
hand
he
kissed
her
and
started
edgar
stopped
him
to
ask
for

the
postman
wanted
fifteen
for
an
underpaid
parcel
susan
the
maid
asked
for
ten
for
some
extra
milk
and
then
he
kissed
his
hand
to
the
parlor
window
and
was
off
no
he
was
not
off
for
clara
threw
up
the
window
and
waved
her
lily
hand
starr
ran
back
to

she
flung
it
open

dear
clara
what
a
saint
you
are

more

and
starr
departed
and
loyally
he
did
the
duty
next
his
hand
he
stopped
and
signed
the
sewerage
petition
he
looked
in
on
poor
colt
and
said
a
cheerful
word
to
him
he
bade
woolley

on

home
from

he
showed
starr
a

it
the

i

you

like
to
see
it
ah

can
wait
at

till
after

dinner
it
was

that
starr
told
the
story
which
the
reader
has
read
in
scene
one
of
the
perils
which
may
come
when
a
man
has
not
a
penny
he
did
not
speak
hastily
nor
cast
reproach
on
clara
for
her
care
of
the
button
over
that
part
of
the
story
he
threw
a
cautious
veil
but
to
boys
and
girls
he
pointed
a
terrible
lesson
of
the
value
of
one
penny
how
dangerous
papa
to
drop
it
into
a
box
for
the
heathen
but
little
tom
found
this
talk
tiresome
and
asked
leave
to
slip
away
teasing
clifford
as
he
went
about
some
clifford
had
promised
him
go
bring
the
parcel
i
left
on
the
hall
table
and
your
papa
will
give
you
some
spanish
stamps
so
the
boy
brought
the
mail
what
in
the
world
is
this
cried
starr
as
he
cut
open
the
great
envelope
and
more
and
more
amazed
he
was
as
he
ran
down
the

his
majesty

pleased
to
say
that
your
views
on
the
pacification
of

rico
coincide
precisely
with
his
own
that
the
hands
of
the
government
will
be
strengthened
as
with
the
force
of
giants
when
he
communicates
them
to
the
very

much
honored

of

a
mark

has
the
pleasure
of
sending
to
you
the

of
asking
your
acceptance

not
be
surprised
when
i
say
that
your
suggestion
made
on
the
deck
of
the
as
to
oxalate
of
strontium
was
received
with
surprise
by
herr
fernow
and
herr
klee
but
such
is
the
respect
in
which
suggestions
from
america
are
now
held
that
they
ordered
a
trial
at
once
in
the
royal
kilns
the
result
of
which
are
memoranda
a
and
b
enclosed
they
are
so
much
delighted

the
schonhoffs

undertake
the

honored

am
at
a
loss

express
to

the
satisfaction
with
which
i
write
the
eminently
practical
suggestions
which
you
made
to
me
so
kindly
and
freely
as
we
parted
have
indeed
also
proved
themselves
undoubtedly
to
be
of
even
the
first
import
it
has
to
me
been
also
indeed
of
the
very
first
pleasure
to
communicate
them
as
i
said
indeed

your
statement
regarding
the

more
than

verified
itself
i
am
requested
by
the
authorities
at
dresden
to
ask
the
acceptance
by
your
accomplished
and
highly
respected
lady

their
recent
manufacture

small
of
their
appreciation

story
i
frederick
dane
was
on
his
way
towards
what
he
called
his
home
his
home
alas
was
but
an
indifferent
attic
in
one
of
the
southern
suburbs
of
boston
he
had
been
walking
but
he
was
now
standing
still
at
the
corner
of
massachusetts
and
columbus
avenues
as
often
happens
frederick
dane
had
an
opportunity
to
wait
at
this
corner
a
quarter
of
an
hour
as
he
looked
around
him
on
the
silent
houses
he
could
not
but
observe
the
which
a
watchful
city
government
had
placed
in
the
street
a
few
days
before
in
preparation
for
the
election
which
was
to
take
place
three
weeks
afterward
dane
is
of
an
inquiring
temper
and
seeing
that
the
had
a
door
and
the
door
had
a
keyhole
he
tried
in
the
keyhole
a
steel
key
which
he
had
picked
up
in
dock
square
the
day
before
almost
to
his
surprise
the
key
governed
the
lock
at
once
and
he
found
himself
able
to
walk
in
he
left
the
door
wide
open
and
the
gaslight
streaming
in
revealed
to
him
the
aspect
of
the
cells
arranged
for
australian
voting
the
rails
were
all
in
their
places
and
the
election
might
take
place
the
very
next
day
it
instantly
occurred
to
dane
that
he
might
save
the
five
cents
which
otherwise
he
would
have
given
to
his
masters
of
the
street
railway
and
be
the
next
morning
three
miles
nearer
his
work
if
he
spent
the
night
in
the
he
looked
around
for
a
minute
or
two
and
found
some
large
rolls
of
street
posters
which
had
been
left
there
by
some
disappointed
canvasser
the
year
before
and
which
had
accompanied
one
cell
of
the
cabin
in
its
travels
dane
is
a
prompt
man
and
in
a
minute
more
he
had
locked
the
door
behind
him
had
struck
a
wax
taper
which
he
had
in
his
had
rolled
the
paper
roll
out
on
the
floor
to
serve
as
a
pillow
in
five
minutes
more
covered
with
his
heavy
coat
he
lay
on
the
floor
sleeping
as
soundly
as
he
had
slept
the
year
before
when
he
found
himself
on
the
lee
side
of
an
iceberg
under
peary
command
this
is
perhaps
unnecessary
detail
by
way
of
saying
that
this
is
the
beginning
of
the
arrangement
which
a
city
not
very
intelligent
will
make
in
the
next
century
for
unsettled
people
whose
own
houses
are
not
agreeable
to
them
there
exist
in
boston
at
this
moment
three
or
four
hundred
of
the
nice
little
houses
enough
better
than
most
of
the
peasantry
of
most
of
europe
ever
lived
in
they
are
alas
generally
packed
up
in
lavender
and
laid
away
for
ten
months
of
the
year
but
in
the
twentieth
century
we
shall
send
them
down
to
the
shores
of
islands
and
other
places
where
people
like
to
spend
the
summer
and
we
shall
utilize
them
not
for
the
few
hours
of
an
election
only
but
all
the
year
round
this
will
not
then
be
called
nationalism
it
will
be
called
democracy
and
that
is
a
very
good
name
when
it
is
applied
to
a
very
good
thing
dane
was
an
old
soldier
and
an
old
seaman
he
was
not
troubled
by
disagreeable
dreams
and
in
the
morning
when
the
began
to
travel
he
was
awaked
a
little
after
sunrise
by
their
clatter
on
the
corner
he
felt
well
satisfied
with
the
success
of
his
experiment
and
began
on
a
forecast
which
the
reader
shall
follow
for
a
few
weeks
which
he
thought
and
thought
rightly
would
tend
to
his
own
convenience
possibly
to
that
of
his
friends
dane
telegraphed
down
to
the
office
that
he
should
be
detained
an
hour
that
morning
went
out
to
his
home
of
the
day
before
at
ashmont
paid
his
landlady
her
scot
brought
in
with
him
his
little
possessions
in
a
valise
to
the
office
and
did
not
appear
at
his
new
home
until
after
nightfall
he
was
then
able
to
establish
himself
on
the
basis
which
proved
convenient
afterwards
and
which
it
is
worth
while
to
explain
to
a
world
which
is
not
too
well
housed
the
city
had
provided
three
or
four
chairs
there
a
stove
and
two
tables
dane
had
little
literature
but
as
he
was
in
the
literary
line
himself
he
did
not
care
for
this
so
much
men
who
write
books
are
not
commonly
eager
to
read
books
which
are
worse
than
their
own
at
a
window
of
a
neighboring
tinman
he
was
able
to
buy
himself
the
few
little
necessities
which
he
wanted
for
housekeeping
and
not
to
detain
the
reader
too
long
upon
merely
fleshly
arrangements
in
the
course
of
a
couple
of
hours
of
tuesday
evening
and
wednesday
evening
he
had
fitted
up
his
convenient
if
not
pretty
bower
with
all
that
man
requires
it
was
easy
to
buy
a
mince
pie
or
a
cream
cake
or
a
bit
of
boiled
ham
or
roast
chicken
according
as
payday
was
near
or
distant
one
is
glad
to
have
a
tablecloth
but
if
one
have
a
large
poster
warning
people
a
year
before
that
they
should
vote
the
prohibition
ticket
one
conscience
is
not
wounded
if
this
poster
ink
down
takes
the
place
which
a
tablecloth
would
have
taken
under
other
circumstances
if
there
is
not
much
crockery
to
use
there
is
but
little
to
and
in
short
as
well
trained
a
man
of
the
world
as
dane
had
made
himself
thoroughly
comfortable
in
his
new
quarters
before
the
week
was
over
ii
at
the
beginning
frederick
views
were
purely
personal
or
as
the
preachers
say
selfish
here
was
an
empty
house
three
miles
nearer
his
work
than
his
hired
attic
was
and
he
had
taken
possession
but
conscience
always
asserts
itself
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
extend
the
benefits
of
this
new
discovery
of
his
somewhat
further
it
really
was
a
satisfaction
to
what
the
pulpits
call
a
felt
want
when
as
he
came
through
massachusetts
avenue
on
thursday
evening
he
met
a
boy
and
a
girl
neither
of
them
more
than
ten
years
old
crying
on
the
sidewalk
dane
is
sympathetic
and
fond
of
children
he
stopped
the
little
brats
and
satisfied
himself
that
neither
had
had
any
supper
he
could
not
understand
a
word
of
the
language
in
which
they
spoke
nor
could
they
understand
him
but
kindness
needs
little
spoken
language
and
accordingly
frederick
led
them
along
to
his
cabin
and
after
waiting
as
he
always
did
a
minute
or
two
to
be
sure
that
no
one
was
in
sight
he
unlocked
the
door
and
brought
in
his
little
companions
it
was
clear
enough
that
the
children
were
such
waifs
and
strays
that
nothing
surprised
them
and
they
readily
accepted
the
modest
hospitalities
of
the
position
like
all
masculine
housekeepers
frederick
had
provided
three
times
as
much
food
as
he
needed
for
his
own
physical
wants
so
that
it
was
not
difficult
to
make
these
children
happy
with
the
pieces
of
mince
pie
and
lemon
pie
and
cream
cake
and
eclairs
which
were
left
from
his
unknown
festivals
of
the
day
before
poor
little
things
they
were
both
cold
and
tired
and
before
half
an
hour
was
over
they
were
snugly
asleep
on
and
under
a
pile
of
prohibition
posters
iii
fortunately
for
frederick
dane
for
the
nine
years
before
he
joined
peary
he
had
lived
in
the
city
of
bagdad
he
had
there
served
as
the
english
interpreter
for
the
caliph
of
that
city
the
caliph
did
most
of
his
business
at
night
and
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
dane
with
him
on
his
evening
excursions
in
this
way
dane
had
made
the
somewhat
intimate
acquaintance
of
jaffrey
the
private
secretary
of
the
caliph
and
he
had
indeed
in
his
own
employment
for
some
time
a
black
man
of
the
name
of
mezrour
who
for
his
other
place
was
engaged
as
a
servant
in
the
caliph
household
dane
was
thus
not
unfamiliar
with
the
methods
of
unexpected
evening
visits
and
it
was
fortunate
for
him
that
he
was
so
the
little
children
whom
he
had
picked
up
explained
to
him
by
pantomime
which
would
have
made
the
fortune
of
a
that
they
were
much
more
comfortable
in
their
new
home
than
they
had
been
in
any
other
and
that
they
had
no
wish
to
leave
it
but
by
various
temptations
addressed
to
them
in
the
form
of
barley
horses
and
dogs
and
sticks
of
barber
candy
dane
who
was
of
a
romantic
and
enterprising
disposition
persuaded
them
to
take
him
to
some
of
their
former
haunts
these
were
mostly
at
the
north
end
of
boston
and
he
soon
found
that
he
needed
all
his
recollections
of
bagdad
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
any
conversation
with
any
of
the
people
they
knew
best
in
a
way
however
with
a
little
broken
arabic
a
little
broken
hebrew
a
great
deal
of
broken
china
and
many
gesticulations
he
made
acquaintance
with
two
of
their
compatriots
who
had
as
it
seemed
crossed
the
ocean
with
them
in
the
same
steerage
that
is
to
say
they
either
had
or
had
not
but
for
many
months
dane
was
unable
to
discover
which
such
as
they
were
however
they
had
been
sleeping
on
the
outside
of
the
upper
attic
of
the
house
in
salutation
alley
where
these
children
had
lodged
or
not
lodged
as
the
case
might
be
during
the
last
few
days
when
dane
saw
what
were
called
their
lodgings
he
did
not
wonder
that
they
had
accepted
luck
with
him
it
is
necessary
to
explain
all
this
that
the
reader
may
understand
why
on
the
first
night
after
the
arrival
of
these
two
children
the
population
of
the
booth
was
enlarged
by
the
presence
of
these
two
hebrew
compatriots
and
without
further
mystery
it
may
be
as
well
to
state
that
all
four
were
from
a
village
about
nine
hundred
and
miles
north
of
odessa
in
the
southern
part
of
russia
they
had
emigrated
in
a
compulsory
manner
from
that
province
first
on
account
of
the
utter
failure
of
anything
to
eat
there
second
on
account
of
a
prejudice
which
the
natives
of
that
country
had
contracted
against
the
hebrew
race
the
two
north
end
friends
of
little
ezra
and
sarah
readily
accepted
the
invitation
of
the
two
children
to
join
in
the
college
settlement
at
the
corner
of
the
two
avenues
the
rules
of
the
institution
proved
attractive
and
before
a
second
week
was
well
advanced
ten
light
excelsior
mattresses
were
regularly
rolled
up
every
morning
as
the
different
inmates
went
to
their
duties
while
as
evening
closed
in
eight
cheerful
companions
told
stories
around
the
hospitable
board
iv
it
is
no
part
of
this
little
tale
to
follow
with
stevenson
magic
or
with
that
of
the
arabian
nights
the
fortunes
from
day
to
day
of
the
little
circle
enough
that
men
of
hebrew
race
do
not
prove
lazy
anywhere
dane
certainly
gave
them
no
bad
example
the
children
were
at
once
entered
in
a
neighboring
school
where
they
showed
the
quickness
of
their
race
they
had
the
advantage
when
the
week
closed
and
began
that
they
could
attend
the
sabbath
school
provided
for
them
by
the
hebrews
on
saturday
and
the
several
schools
of
the
parker
memorial
the
berkeley
temple
and
the
other
churches
of
the
neighborhood
the
day
before
the
election
frederick
dane
asked
oleg
and
vladimir
to
help
him
in
bringing
up
some
short
boards
which
they
laid
on
the
trusses
in
the
roof
above
them
on
the
little
attic
thus
prepared
they
stored
their
mattresses
and
other
personal
effects
before
the
great
election
of
that
year
began
they
had
no
intention
of
interfering
even
by
a
cup
of
cold
coffee
with
the
great
wave
of
righteous
indignation
which
on
that
particular
day
of
that
particular
year
swept
away
as
by
a
great
cosmic
tidal
flood
the
pretences
and
ambitions
etc
these
words
are
cited
from
frederick
dane
editorial
of
the
next
morning
and
were
in
fact
used
by
him
or
by
some
of
his
friends
without
variations
in
all
the
cosmic
changes
of
the
elections
of
the
next
six
years
v
but
so
soon
as
this
election
was
well
over
the
country
and
the
city
settled
down
with
what
ransom
used
to
call
amazin
readiness
to
the
new
order
such
as
it
was
only
the
people
who
take
up
the
streets
detached
more
men
than
ever
to
spoil
the
pavement
for
now
a
city
election
was
approaching
and
it
might
be
that
the
pavers
and
ditchers
and
shovellers
and
curbstone
men
and
asphalt
makers
should
vote
wrong
dane
and
his
settlement
were
well
aware
that
after
this
election
they
would
all
have
to
move
out
from
their
comfortable
quarters
but
while
they
were
in
they
determined
to
prepare
for
a
fit
thanksgiving
to
god
and
the
country
which
makes
provision
so
generous
for
those
in
need
it
is
not
every
country
indeed
which
provides
four
hundred
empty
houses
every
autumn
for
the
convenience
of
any
unlodged
with
a
skeleton
key
who
comes
along
he
explained
to
his
companions
that
a
great
festival
was
near
they
heard
this
with
joy
he
explained
that
no
work
would
be
done
that
day
not
in
any
or
this
also
pleased
them
he
then
at
some
length
explained
the
necessity
of
the
sacrifice
of
turkeys
on
the
occasion
he
told
briefly
how
josselyn
and
the
fathers
shot
them
as
they
passed
through
the
sky
but
he
explained
that
now
we
shoot
them
as
one
makes
money
not
directly
but
indirectly
we
shoot
our
turkeys
say
at
all
this
proved
intelligible
and
frederick
had
no
fear
for
turkeys
as
for
sarah
and
ezra
he
found
that
at
ezra
club
and
at
sarah
girls
club
and
each
of
her
school
classes
and
classes
and
at
each
of
his
it
had
been
explained
that
on
the
day
before
thanksgiving
they
must
come
with
baskets
to
places
named
and
carry
home
a
thanksgiving
dinner
these
announcements
were
hailed
with
satisfaction
by
all
to
whom
dane
addressed
them
everything
in
the
country
was
as
strange
to
them
as
it
would
have
been
to
an
old
friend
of
mine
an
inhabitant
of
the
planet
mars
and
they
accepted
the
custom
of
this
holiday
among
the
rest
oddly
enough
it
proved
that
one
or
two
of
them
were
shots
and
by
attendance
at
different
they
brought
in
more
than
a
turkey
apiece
as
governor
bradford
men
did
in
many
of
them
were
at
work
in
large
factories
where
it
was
the
custom
of
the
house
to
give
a
roasted
turkey
and
a
pan
of
cranberry
sauce
to
each
person
who
had
been
on
the
for
three
months
one
or
two
of
them
were
errand
men
in
the
market
and
it
was
the
practice
of
the
wholesale
dealers
there
who
at
this
season
become
to
a
certain
extent
retailers
to
encourage
these
errand
men
by
presenting
to
each
of
them
a
turkey
which
was
promised
in
advance
as
for
dane
himself
the
proprietors
of
his
journal
always
presented
a
turkey
to
each
man
on
their
staff
and
in
looking
forward
to
his
thanksgiving
at
the
polls
he
had
expected
to
provide
a
pound
gobbler
which
a
friend
in
vermont
was
keeping
for
him
it
may
readily
be
imagined
then
that
when
the
day
before
thanksgiving
came
he
was
more
oppressed
by
an
embarrassment
of
riches
than
by
any
difficulty
on
the
debtor
side
of
his
account
he
had
twelve
people
to
feed
himself
included
there
were
the
two
children
their
eight
friends
and
a
young
frenchman
from
paris
who
like
all
persons
of
that
nationality
who
are
six
months
in
this
country
had
found
many
enemies
here
dane
had
invited
him
to
dinner
he
had
arranged
that
there
should
be
plates
or
saucers
enough
for
each
person
to
have
two
and
now
there
was
to
be
a
pie
from
obed
shalom
some
mince
pies
and
marlborough
pies
from
the
union
for
christian
work
a
turkey
at
each
end
of
the
board
and
he
found
he
should
have
left
over
after
the
largest
computation
for
the
appetites
of
the
visitors
pies
of
different
structure
five
dishes
of
cranberry
sauce
three
or
four
boxes
of
raisins
two
or
three
drums
of
figs
two
roasted
geese
and
eleven
turkeys
he
counted
all
the
turkeys
as
roasted
because
he
had
the
promise
of
the
keeper
of
the
montgomery
house
that
he
would
roast
for
him
all
the
birds
that
were
brought
in
to
him
before
nine
on
thanksgiving
morning
vi
having
stated
all
this
on
a
list
carefully
written
first
in
the
english
language
and
second
in
the
language
of
the
hebrews
frederick
called
his
lodgers
together
earlier
than
usual
on
the
evening
before
thanksgiving
day
he
explained
to
them
in
the
patois
which
they
used
together
that
it
would
be
indecent
for
them
to
carry
this
supply
of
food
farther
than
next
monday
for
their
own
purposes
he
told
them
that
the
occasion
was
one
of
exuberant
thanksgiving
to
the
god
of
heaven
he
showed
them
that
they
all
had
great
reason
for
thanksgiving
and
in
short
he
made
three
heads
of
a
discourse
which
might
have
been
expanded
by
the
most
eloquent
preacher
in
boston
the
next
day
and
would
have
well
covered
the
five
minutes
which
the
regulation
would
have
required
for
a
sermon
he
then
said
that
as
they
had
been
favored
with
much
more
than
they
could
use
for
their
own
appetites
they
must
look
up
those
who
were
not
so
well
off
as
themselves
he
was
well
pleased
by
finding
that
he
was
understood
and
what
he
said
was
received
with
applause
in
the
various
forms
in
which
southern
russia
applauds
on
such
occasions
as
for
the
two
children
their
eyes
were
wide
open
and
their
mouths
and
they
looked
their
wonder
frederick
then
proposed
that
two
of
their
number
should
volunteer
to
open
a
rival
establishment
at
the
at
the
corner
of
gates
street
and
burgoyne
street
and
that
the
company
should
on
the
next
day
invite
guests
enough
to
make
another
table
of
twelve
he
proposed
that
the
same
course
should
be
taken
at
the
corner
of
shapleigh
and
bowditch
streets
and
yet
again
at
the
booth
which
is
at
the
corner
of
curtis
avenue
and
quincy
street
and
he
said
that
as
time
would
press
upon
them
they
had
better
arrange
to
carry
a
part
at
least
of
the
stores
to
these
places
that
evening
to
this
there
was
a
general
assent
the
company
sat
down
to
a
hasty
tea
administered
much
as
the
israelites
took
their
last
meal
in
egypt
for
every
man
had
on
his
long
frieze
coat
and
his
heavy
boots
and
they
were
eager
for
the
active
work
of
thanksgiving
for
each
the
stewards
packed
two
turkeys
in
a
basket
filled
in
as
far
as
they
could
with
other
stores
and
frederick
headed
his
procession
it
was
then
that
he
was
to
learn
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
not
the
only
person
in
boston
it
was
then
that
he
found
out
that
the
revelation
made
to
one
man
is
frequently
made
to
many
he
found
out
that
he
was
as
wise
as
the
next
fellow
but
was
no
wiser
was
as
good
as
the
next
fellow
but
was
no
better
and
that
in
short
he
had
no
special
patent
upon
his
own
undertaking
the
little
procession
soon
arrived
at
the
corner
of
shapleigh
and
bowditch
streets
whoever
had
made
the
locks
on
the
doors
of
the
houses
had
been
content
to
use
the
same
pattern
for
all
it
proved
therefore
that
the
key
of
no
answered
for
no
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
open
the
door
with
the
jimmy
which
simeon
had
under
his
ulster
but
on
the
other
hand
to
frederick
amazement
as
he
threw
the
door
open
he
found
a
lighted
room
and
a
long
table
around
which
sat
twelve
men
guised
or
disguised
in
much
the
same
way
as
those
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
a
few
moments
showed
that
another
leader
of
the
people
had
discovered
this
vacant
home
a
few
weeks
before
and
had
established
there
another
settlement
of
the
as
it
proved
this
gentleman
was
a
mashpee
indian
he
was
in
fact
the
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
from
the
town
of
mashpee
for
the
next
winter
arriving
in
boston
to
look
for
lodgings
he
not
unnaturally
met
with
a
mohawk
two
dacotahs
and
a
cherokee
who
for
various
errands
had
come
north
and
east
a
similarity
of
color
not
to
say
of
racial
relations
had
established
a
warm
friendship
among
the
five
and
they
had
brought
together
gradually
twelve
gentlemen
of
copper
color
who
had
been
residing
in
this
since
the
second
day
after
the
general
election
their
fortune
had
not
been
unlike
that
of
frederick
and
his
friends
and
at
this
moment
they
were
discussing
the
methods
by
which
they
might
distribute
several
brace
of
ducks
which
had
been
sent
up
from
mashpee
a
haunch
of
venison
which
had
come
down
from
above
machias
and
some
wild
turkeys
which
had
arrived
by
express
from
the
regis
indians
of
northern
new
york
at
the
moment
of
the
arrival
of
our
friends
they
were
sending
out
two
of
their
number
to
find
how
they
might
best
distribute
thus
their
extra
provender
these
two
gladly
joined
in
the
little
procession
and
all
went
together
to
the
corner
of
quincy
street
and
curtis
avenue
there
a
similar
revelation
was
made
only
there
was
some
difficulty
at
first
in
any
real
mutual
understanding
for
here
they
met
a
dozen
more
or
less
of
french
canadians
these
gentlemen
had
left
their
wives
and
their
children
in
the
province
of
quebec
and
finding
themselves
in
boston
had
taken
possession
of
the
where
they
were
living
much
more
comfortably
than
they
would
have
lived
at
home
they
too
had
been
well
provided
for
thanksgiving
both
by
their
friends
at
home
and
by
their
employers
and
had
been
questioning
as
to
the
distribution
which
they
could
make
of
their
supplies
reinforced
by
four
of
their
number
the
delegation
in
search
of
hungry
people
was
increased
to
fourteen
in
number
and
with
a
certain
curiosity
it
must
be
confessed
they
went
together
to
try
their
respective
keys
on
no
opening
this
without
so
much
as
knocking
at
the
door
to
know
if
here
they
might
not
provide
the
annex
or
tender
which
they
wished
to
establish
they
found
it
must
be
confessed
without
any
amazement
or
amusement
a
company
of
italians
under
the
charge
of
one
antonio
fero
who
had
also
worked
out
the
problem
of
cheap
lodgings
and
had
established
themselves
for
some
weeks
here
these
men
also
had
been
touched
either
by
some
voice
or
other
divine
word
with
a
sense
of
the
duties
of
the
occasion
and
were
just
looking
round
to
know
where
they
might
spread
their
second
table
five
of
them
joined
the
fourteen
and
the
whole
company
after
a
rapid
conversation
agreed
that
they
would
try
no
on
the
other
side
of
the
avenue
and
here
their
fortunes
changed
for
here
it
proved
that
the
cops
on
that
beat
finding
nights
growing
somewhat
cold
and
that
there
was
no
provision
made
by
the
police
commissioners
for
a
room
for
gentlemen
of
their
profession
had
themselves
arranged
in
the
a
convenient
place
for
the
reading
of
the
evening
newspapers
and
for
conference
on
their
mutual
affairs
these
cops
were
unmarried
men
and
did
not
much
know
where
was
the
home
in
which
the
governor
requested
them
to
spend
their
thanksgiving
they
had
therefore
determined
to
spread
their
own
table
in
their
and
this
evening
had
been
making
preparations
for
a
picnic
feast
there
at
midnight
on
thanksgiving
day
when
they
should
be
relieved
from
their
more
pressing
duties
they
also
had
found
the
liberality
of
each
member
of
the
force
had
brought
in
more
than
would
be
requisite
and
were
considering
the
same
subject
which
had
oppressed
the
consciences
of
the
leaders
of
the
other
bands
no
one
ever
knew
who
made
the
great
suggestion
but
it
is
probable
that
it
was
one
of
these
officials
well
acquainted
with
the
charter
of
the
city
of
boston
and
with
its
constitution
and
who
offered
the
proposal
which
was
adopted
in
the
jealousy
of
the
fierce
democracy
of
boston
in
the
year
when
the
present
city
charter
was
made
it
reserved
for
itself
permission
to
open
faneuil
hall
at
any
time
for
a
public
meeting
it
proves
now
that
whenever
fifty
citizens
unite
to
ask
for
the
use
of
the
hall
for
such
a
meeting
it
must
be
given
to
them
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
reading
the
mayor
had
to
preside
at
every
such
meeting
at
the
cops
club
it
was
highly
determined
that
the
names
of
fifty
citizens
should
at
once
be
obtained
and
that
the
cradle
of
liberty
should
be
secured
for
the
general
thanksgiving
it
was
wisely
resolved
that
no
public
notice
should
be
given
of
this
in
the
journals
it
was
well
known
that
that
argus
called
the
press
is
very
apt
not
to
interfere
with
that
which
is
none
of
its
business
vii
and
thus
it
happened
that
when
thanksgiving
day
came
the
worthy
janitor
of
faneuil
hall
sent
down
his
assistant
to
open
it
and
that
the
assistant
who
meant
to
dine
at
home
found
a
friend
from
the
country
who
took
the
keys
and
lighted
the
gas
in
his
place
before
the
sun
had
set
frederick
dane
and
antonio
fero
and
michael
chevalier
and
the
honorable
and
eben
kartschoff
arrived
with
an
driven
by
a
stepson
of
nolan
there
is
no
difficulty
at
faneuil
hall
in
bringing
out
a
few
trestles
and
as
many
boards
as
one
wants
for
tables
for
faneuil
hall
is
a
place
given
to
hospitality
and
so
before
six
the
hour
assigned
for
the
extemporized
dinner
the
tables
were
set
with
turkeys
with
geese
with
venison
with
mallards
and
plover
with
quail
and
partridges
with
cranberry
and
squash
and
with
dishes
of
russia
and
italy
and
greece
and
bohemia
such
as
have
no
names
the
greeks
brought
fruits
the
indians
brought
venison
the
italians
brought
red
wine
the
french
brought
walnuts
and
chestnuts
and
the
good
god
sent
a
blessing
almost
every
man
found
up
either
a
wife
or
a
sweetheart
or
a
daughter
or
a
niece
to
come
with
him
and
the
feast
went
on
to
the
small
hours
of
friday
the
mayor
came
down
on
time
and
being
an
accomplished
man
addressed
them
in
english
in
latin
in
greek
in
hebrew
and
in
tuscan
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
they
understood
him
but
no
record
has
ever
been
made
of
the
feast
in
any
on
this
side
the
line
yet
there
are
those
who
have
seen
it
or
something
like
it
with
the
eye
of
faith
and
when
a
hundred
years
hence
some
antiquary
reads
this
story
in
a
number
of
the
omaha
intelligencer
which
has
escaped
the
detrition
of
the
thousand
days
and
nights
he
will
say
why
this
was
the
beginning
of
what
we
do
now
only
these
people
seem
to
have
taken
care
of
strangers
only
one
month
in
the
twelve
why
did
they
not
welcome
all
strangers
in
like
manner
until
they
had
made
them
feel
at
home
these
people
once
a
year
seem
to
have
fed
the
hungry
would
it
not
have
been
simpler
for
them
to
provide
that
no
man
should
ever
be
hungry
these
people
certainly
thanked
god
to
some
purpose
once
a
year
how
happy
is
the
nation
which
has
learned
to
thank
him
always
the
survivor
story
fortunately
we
were
with
our
wives
it
is
in
general
an
excellent
custom
as
i
will
explain
if
opportunity
is
given
first
you
are
thus
sure
of
good
company
for
four
mortal
hours
we
had
ground
along
and
stopped
and
waited
and
started
again
in
the
drifts
between
westfield
and
springfield
we
had
shrieked
out
our
woes
by
the
voices
of
five
engines
brave
men
had
dug
patient
men
had
sat
inside
and
waited
for
the
results
of
the
digging
at
last
in
triumph
at
eleven
and
three
quarters
as
they
say
in
cinderella
we
entered
the
springfield
station
it
was
christmas
eve
leaving
the
train
to
its
devices
blatchford
and
his
wife
her
name
was
sarah
and
i
with
mine
her
name
was
phebe
walked
quickly
with
our
little
sacks
out
of
the
station
ploughed
and
waded
along
the
white
street
not
to
the
massasoit
no
but
to
the
old
eagle
and
star
which
was
still
standing
and
was
a
favorite
with
us
youngsters
good
waffles
maple
syrup
ad
such
fixings
of
other
sorts
as
we
preferred
and
some
liberty
the
amount
of
liberty
in
absolutely
hotels
is
but
small
a
drowsy
boy
waked
and
turned
up
the
gas
blatchford
entered
our
names
on
the
register
and
cried
at
once
by
george
wolfgang
is
here
and
dick
what
luck
for
dick
and
wolfgang
also
travel
with
their
wives
the
boy
explained
that
they
had
come
up
the
river
in
the
new
haven
train
were
only
nine
hours
behind
time
had
arrived
at
ten
and
had
just
finished
supper
and
gone
to
bed
we
ordered
rare
beefsteak
waffles
omelettes
with
kidneys
and
omelettes
without
we
toasted
our
feet
at
the
open
fire
in
the
parlor
we
ate
the
supper
when
it
was
ready
and
we
also
went
to
bed
rejoicing
that
we
had
home
with
us
having
travelled
with
our
wives
and
that
we
could
keep
our
merry
christmas
here
if
only
wolfgang
and
dick
and
their
wives
would
join
us
all
would
be
well
wolfgang
wife
was
named
bertha
and
dick
was
named
hosanna
a
name
i
have
never
met
with
elsewhere
bed
followed
and
i
am
a
graceless
dog
that
i
do
not
write
a
sonnet
here
on
the
unbroken
slumber
that
followed
breakfast
by
arrangement
of
us
four
at
nine
at
to
us
enter
bertha
dick
hosanna
and
wolfgang
to
name
them
in
alphabetical
order
four
chairs
had
been
turned
down
for
them
four
chops
four
omelettes
and
four
small
oval
dishes
of
fried
potatoes
had
been
ordered
and
now
appeared
immense
shouting
immense
kissing
among
those
who
had
that
privilege
general
wondering
and
great
congratulating
that
our
wives
were
there
solid
resolution
that
we
would
advance
no
farther
here
and
here
only
in
springfield
itself
would
we
celebrate
our
christmas
day
it
may
be
remarked
in
parenthesis
that
we
had
learned
already
that
no
train
had
entered
the
town
since
eleven
and
a
quarter
and
it
was
known
by
telegraph
that
none
was
within
miles
and
a
half
of
the
spot
at
the
moment
the
vow
was
made
we
waded
and
ploughed
our
way
through
the
snow
to
church
i
think
rumfry
if
that
is
the
name
who
preached
an
admirable
christmas
sermon
in
a
beautiful
church
there
will
remember
the
platoon
of
four
men
and
four
women
who
made
perhaps
a
fifth
of
his
congregation
in
that
storm
a
storm
which
shut
off
most
home
again
a
jolly
fire
in
the
parlor
dry
stockings
and
dry
slippers
turkeys
and
all
things
fitting
for
the
dinner
and
then
a
general
assembly
not
in
a
caravansary
not
in
a
but
in
the
regular
guests
parlor
of
a
new
england
hotel
where
as
it
was
ordered
there
were
no
transients
but
ourselves
that
day
and
whence
all
the
boarders
had
gone
either
to
their
own
rooms
or
to
other
homes
for
people
who
have
their
wives
with
them
it
is
not
difficult
to
provide
entertainment
on
such
an
occasion
bertha
said
wolfgang
could
you
not
entertain
us
with
one
of
your
native
dances
ho
slave
said
dick
to
hosanna
play
upon
the
virginals
and
hosanna
played
a
lively
arab
air
on
the
tavern
piano
while
the
fair
bertha
danced
with
a
spirit
unusual
was
it
indeed
in
memory
of
the
christmas
of
her
own
dear
home
in
circassia
all
that
from
bertha
to
circassia
is
not
so
we
did
not
do
this
at
all
that
was
all
a
slip
of
the
pen
what
we
did
was
this
john
blatchford
pulled
the
till
it
broke
they
always
break
in
novels
and
sometimes
they
do
in
taverns
this
broke
the
sleepy
boy
came
and
john
said
caitiff
is
there
never
a
barber
in
the
house
the
frightened
boy
said
there
was
and
john
bade
him
send
him
in
a
minute
the
barber
appeared
black
as
was
expected
with
a
shining
face
and
white
teeth
and
in
and
broad
inquiry
do
you
tell
me
caesar
said
john
that
in
your
country
they
do
not
wear
their
coats
on
christmas
day
sartin
they
do
sah
when
they
go
outdoors
do
you
tell
me
caesar
said
dick
that
they
have
doors
in
your
country
sartin
they
do
said
poor
caesar
flurried
boy
said
i
the
gentlemen
are
making
fun
of
you
they
want
to
know
if
you
ever
keep
christmas
in
your
country
without
a
dance
never
sah
said
poor
caesar
do
they
dance
without
music
no
sah
never
go
then
i
said
in
my
sternest
accents
go
fetch
a
zithern
or
a
banjo
or
a
kit
or
a
or
a
fiddle
the
black
boy
went
and
returned
with
his
violin
and
as
the
light
grew
gray
and
crept
into
the
darkness
and
as
the
darkness
gathered
more
thick
and
more
he
played
for
us
and
he
played
for
us
tune
after
tune
and
we
danced
first
with
precision
then
in
sport
then
in
wild
holiday
frenzy
we
began
with
waltzes
so
great
is
the
convenience
of
travelling
with
your
wives
where
should
we
have
been
had
we
been
all
sole
alone
four
men
probably
playing
whist
or
euchre
and
now
we
began
with
waltzes
which
passed
into
polkas
which
subsided
into
other
round
dances
and
then
in
very
exhaustion
we
fell
back
in
a
grave
quadrille
i
danced
with
hosanna
wolfgang
and
sarah
were
our
we
went
through
the
same
set
that
noah
and
his
three
boys
danced
in
the
ark
with
their
four
wives
and
which
has
been
danced
ever
since
in
every
moment
on
one
or
another
spot
of
the
dry
earth
going
round
it
with
the
sun
like
the
of
england
right
and
left
first
two
forward
right
hand
across
pastorale
the
whole
series
of
them
we
did
them
with
as
much
spirit
as
if
it
had
been
on
a
flat
on
the
side
of
ararat
ground
yet
too
muddy
for
croquet
then
blatchford
called
for
virginia
reel
and
we
raced
and
chased
through
that
poor
caesar
began
to
get
exhausted
but
a
little
flip
from
downstairs
helped
him
amazingly
and
after
the
flip
dick
cried
can
you
not
dance
and
in
one
wild
frenzy
of
delight
we
danced
and
victory
and
dusty
miller
and
youth
companion
and
irish
jigs
on
the
lifted
off
for
the
occasion
till
the
men
lay
on
the
floor
screaming
with
the
fun
and
the
women
fell
back
on
the
sofas
fairly
faint
with
laughing
all
this
last
since
the
sentence
after
circassia
is
a
mistake
there
was
not
any
bell
nor
any
barber
and
we
did
not
dance
at
all
this
was
all
a
slip
of
my
memory
what
we
really
did
was
this
john
blatchford
said
let
us
all
tell
stories
it
was
growing
dark
and
he
put
more
logs
on
the
fire
bertha
said
heap
on
more
wood
the
wind
is
chill
but
let
it
whistle
as
it
will
we
keep
our
merry
christmas
still
she
said
that
because
it
was
in
bertha
visit
a
very
stupid
book
which
she
remembered
then
wolfgang
told
the
story
wolfgang
is
a
reporter
or
was
then
on
the
staff
of
the
star
when
i
was
on
the
tribune
he
never
was
on
the
tribune
an
hour
unless
he
calls
selling
the
tribune
at
fort
plains
being
on
the
tribune
but
i
tell
the
story
as
he
told
it
he
said
when
i
was
on
the
tribune
i
was
despatched
to
report
webster
great
reply
to
hayne
this
was
in
the
days
of
stages
we
had
to
ride
from
baltimore
to
washington
early
in
the
morning
to
get
there
in
time
i
found
my
boots
were
gone
from
my
room
when
the
called
me
and
i
reported
that
speech
in
worsted
slippers
my
wife
had
given
me
the
week
before
as
we
came
into
bladensburg
it
grew
light
and
i
recognized
my
boots
on
the
feet
of
my
passenger
there
was
but
one
other
man
in
the
stage
i
turned
to
claim
them
but
stopped
in
a
moment
for
it
was
webster
himself
how
serene
his
face
looked
as
he
slept
there
he
woke
soon
passed
the
time
of
day
offered
me
a
part
of
a
sandwich
for
we
were
old
friends
i
was
counsel
against
him
in
the
ogden
case
said
webster
to
me
steele
i
am
bothered
about
this
speech
i
have
a
paragraph
in
it
which
i
can
not
word
up
to
my
mind
and
he
repeated
it
to
me
how
would
this
do
said
he
us
hope
that
the
sense
of
unrestricted
freedom
may
be
so
intertwined
with
the
desire
to
preserve
a
connection
of
the
several
parts
of
the
body
politic
that
some
arrangement
more
or
less
lasting
may
prove
in
a
measure
satisfactory
how
would
that
do
i
said
i
liked
the
idea
but
the
expression
seemed
involved
and
it
is
involved
said
webster
but
i
improve
it
how
would
this
do
said
i
and
union
now
and
forever
one
and
inseparable
capital
he
said
capital
write
that
down
for
me
at
that
moment
we
arrived
at
the
capitol
steps
i
wrote
down
the
words
for
him
and
from
my
notes
he
read
them
when
that
place
in
the
speech
came
along
all
of
us
applauded
the
story
phebe
then
told
the
schoolmistress
story
you
remind
me
of
the
impression
that
very
speech
made
on
me
as
i
heard
henry
chapin
deliver
it
at
an
exhibition
at
leicester
academy
i
resolved
then
that
i
would
free
the
slave
or
perish
in
the
attempt
but
how
i
a
woman
disfranchised
by
the
law
ha
i
saw
i
went
to
arkansas
i
opened
a
normal
college
or
academy
for
teachers
we
had
balls
every
second
night
to
make
it
popular
immense
numbers
came
half
the
teachers
of
the
southern
states
were
trained
there
i
had
admirable
instructors
in
oil
painting
and
music
the
most
essential
studies
the
arithmetic
i
taught
myself
i
taught
it
well
i
achieved
fame
i
achieved
wealth
invested
in
arkansas
five
per
cents
only
one
secret
device
i
persevered
in
to
all
old
and
young
innocent
girls
and
sturdy
men
i
so
taught
the
multiplication
table
that
one
fatal
error
was
hidden
in
its
array
of
facts
the
nine
line
is
the
difficult
one
i
buried
the
error
there
nine
times
six
i
taught
them
is
the
rhyme
made
it
easy
the
gilded
falsehood
passed
from
lip
to
lip
from
state
to
state
one
little
speck
in
a
chain
of
golden
verity
i
retired
from
teaching
slowly
i
watched
the
growth
of
the
rebellion
at
last
the
aloe
blossom
shot
up
after
its
hundred
years
of
waiting
the
southern
heart
was
fired
i
brooded
over
my
revenge
i
repaired
to
richmond
i
opened
a
where
all
the
cabinet
and
most
of
the
senate
came
for
their
meals
and
i
had
eight
permanents
soon
their
brows
clouded
the
first
flush
of
victory
passed
away
night
after
night
they
sat
over
their
calculations
which
all
came
wrong
i
smiled
and
was
a
villain
none
of
their
sums
would
prove
none
of
their
estimates
matched
the
performance
never
a
that
fitted
as
it
should
do
and
i
the
despised
i
alone
knew
why
often
and
often
when
memminger
has
said
to
me
with
an
oath
why
this
discordancy
in
our
totals
have
my
lips
burned
to
tell
the
secret
but
no
i
hid
it
in
my
bosom
and
when
at
last
i
saw
a
black
regiment
march
into
richmond
singing
john
brown
i
cried
for
the
first
time
in
twenty
years
six
times
nine
is
and
gloated
in
my
sweet
revenge
then
was
hushed
the
harp
of
phebe
and
dick
told
his
story
the
inspector
of
story
mine
is
a
tale
of
the
ingratitude
of
republics
it
is
thirty
years
since
i
was
walking
by
the
owego
and
ithaca
railroad
a
crooked
road
not
then
adapted
to
high
speed
of
a
sudden
i
saw
that
a
long
cross
timber
on
a
trestle
high
above
a
swamp
had
sprung
up
from
its
ties
i
looked
for
a
spike
with
which
to
secure
it
i
found
a
stone
with
which
to
hammer
the
spike
but
at
this
moment
a
train
approached
down
hill
i
screamed
they
heard
but
the
engine
had
no
power
to
stop
the
heavy
train
with
the
presence
of
mind
of
a
poet
and
the
courage
of
a
hero
i
flung
my
own
weight
on
the
fatal
timber
i
would
hold
it
down
or
perish
the
engine
came
the
elasticity
of
the
pine
timber
whirled
me
in
the
air
but
i
held
on
the
tender
crossed
again
i
was
flung
in
wild
gyrations
but
i
held
on
it
is
no
bed
of
roses
i
said
but
what
act
of
parliament
was
there
that
i
should
be
happy
three
passenger
cars
and
ten
freight
cars
as
was
then
the
vicious
custom
of
that
road
passed
me
but
i
held
on
repeating
to
myself
texts
of
scripture
to
give
me
courage
as
the
last
car
passed
i
was
whirled
into
the
air
by
the
rebound
of
the
rafter
heavens
i
said
if
my
orbit
is
a
hyperbola
i
shall
never
return
to
earth
hastily
i
estimated
its
ordinates
and
calculated
the
curve
what
bliss
it
was
a
parabola
after
a
flight
of
a
hundred
and
seventeen
cubits
i
landed
head
down
in
a
soft
in
that
train
was
the
young
grant
on
his
way
to
west
point
for
examination
but
for
me
the
armies
of
the
republic
would
have
had
no
leader
i
pressed
my
claim
when
i
asked
to
be
appointed
minister
to
england
although
no
one
else
wished
to
go
i
alone
was
forgotten
such
is
gratitude
with
republics
he
ceased
then
sarah
blatchford
told
the
wheeler
and
wilson
operative
story
my
father
had
left
the
anchorage
of
sorrento
for
a
short
voyage
if
voyage
it
may
be
called
life
was
young
and
this
world
seemed
heaven
the
yacht
bowled
on
under
staysails
and
all
was
happy
suddenly
the
corsairs
seized
us
all
were
slain
in
my
defence
but
i
this
fatal
gift
of
beauty
bade
them
spare
my
life
why
linger
on
my
tale
in
the
zenana
of
the
shah
of
persia
i
found
my
home
how
escape
his
eye
i
said
and
fortunately
i
remembered
that
in
my
reticule
i
carried
one
box
of
kidder
indelible
ink
instantly
i
applied
the
liquid
in
the
large
bottle
to
one
cheek
soon
as
it
was
dry
i
applied
that
in
the
small
bottle
and
sat
in
the
sun
one
hour
my
head
ached
with
the
sunlight
but
what
of
that
i
was
a
fright
and
i
knew
all
would
be
well
i
was
consigned
so
soon
as
my
hideous
deficiencies
were
known
to
the
then
how
i
sighed
for
my
machine
alas
it
was
not
there
but
i
constructed
an
imitation
from
a
a
and
two
and
with
this
i
made
the
underclothing
for
the
palace
and
the
zenana
i
also
vowed
revenge
nor
did
i
doubt
one
instant
how
for
in
my
youth
i
had
read
lucretia
memoirs
and
i
had
a
certain
rule
for
slowly
slaying
a
tyrant
at
a
distance
i
was
in
charge
of
the
shah
own
linen
every
week
i
set
back
the
buttons
on
his
shirt
collars
by
the
width
of
one
thread
or
by
arts
known
to
me
i
shrunk
the
binding
of
the
collar
by
a
like
proportion
tighter
and
tighter
with
each
week
did
the
vice
close
around
his
larynx
week
by
week
at
the
high
religious
festivals
i
could
see
his
face
was
blacker
and
blacker
at
length
the
hated
tyrant
died
the
leeches
called
it
apoplexy
i
did
not
undeceive
them
his
guards
sacked
the
palace
i
bagged
the
diamonds
fled
with
them
to
trebizond
and
sailed
thence
in
a
caique
to
south
boston
no
more
such
memories
oppress
me
her
voice
was
hushed
i
told
my
tale
in
turn
the
conductor
story
i
was
poor
let
this
be
my
excuse
or
rather
my
apology
i
entered
a
third
avenue
car
at
street
and
saw
the
conductor
sleeping
satan
tempted
me
and
i
took
from
him
his
badge
i
see
the
hated
figures
now
when
he
woke
he
knew
not
he
had
lost
it
the
car
started
and
he
walked
to
the
rear
with
the
badge
on
my
coat
i
collected
eight
fares
within
stepped
forward
and
sprang
into
the
street
poverty
is
my
only
apology
for
the
crime
i
concealed
myself
in
a
cellar
where
men
were
playing
with
props
fear
is
my
only
excuse
lest
they
should
suspect
me
i
joined
their
game
and
my
forty
cents
were
soon
three
dollars
and
seventy
with
these
gains
i
visited
the
gold
exchange
then
open
evenings
my
superior
intelligence
enabled
me
to
place
well
my
modest
means
and
at
midnight
i
had
a
competence
let
me
be
a
warning
to
all
young
men
since
that
night
i
have
never
gambled
more
i
threw
the
hated
badge
into
the
river
i
bought
a
palace
on
murray
hill
and
led
an
upright
and
honorable
life
but
since
that
night
of
terror
the
sound
of
the
oppresses
me
always
since
to
go
up
town
or
down
i
order
my
own
coupe
with
george
to
drive
me
and
never
have
i
entered
the
cleanly
sweet
and
airy
carriage
provided
for
the
public
i
can
not
conscience
is
too
much
for
me
you
see
in
me
a
monument
of
crime
i
said
no
more
a
moment
pause
a
few
natural
tears
and
a
single
sigh
hushed
the
assembly
then
bertha
with
her
siren
voice
told
the
wife
of
biddeford
story
at
the
time
you
speak
of
i
was
the
private
governess
of
two
lovely
boys
julius
and
pompey
pompey
the
senior
of
the
two
the
darling
i
see
him
now
i
also
see
hanging
to
his
neck
his
brother
who
had
given
pompey
his
black
eye
the
day
before
pompey
was
generous
to
a
fault
julius
parsimonious
beyond
virtue
i
therefore
instructed
them
in
two
different
rooms
to
pompey
i
read
the
story
of
waste
not
want
not
to
julius
on
the
other
hand
i
spoke
of
the
of
his
great
mother
nature
and
her
profuse
gifts
to
her
children
leaving
him
with
grapes
and
oranges
i
stepped
back
to
pompey
and
taught
him
how
to
untie
parcels
so
as
to
save
the
string
leaving
him
winding
the
string
neatly
i
went
back
to
julius
and
gave
him
the
dear
boys
grew
from
year
to
year
they
outgrew
their
knickerbockers
and
had
trousers
they
outgrew
their
jackets
and
became
men
and
i
felt
that
i
had
not
lived
in
vain
i
had
conquered
nature
pompey
the
little
spendthrift
was
the
honored
cashier
of
a
till
he
ran
away
with
the
capital
julius
the
miser
became
the
chief
croupier
at
the
new
crockford
one
of
those
boys
is
now
in
botany
bay
and
the
other
is
in
sierra
leone
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
in
a
hotter
place
said
john
blatchford
and
he
told
his
story
the
stoker
story
we
were
crossing
the
atlantic
in
a
cunarder
i
was
second
stoker
on
the
starboard
watch
in
that
horrible
gale
we
spoke
of
before
dinner
the
coal
was
exhausted
and
i
as
the
man
was
sent
up
to
the
captain
to
ask
him
what
we
should
do
i
found
him
himself
at
the
wheel
he
almost
cursed
me
and
bade
me
say
nothing
of
coal
at
a
moment
when
he
must
keep
her
head
to
the
wind
with
her
full
power
or
we
were
lost
he
bade
me
slide
my
hand
into
his
pocket
and
take
out
the
key
of
the
after
open
that
and
use
the
contents
for
fuel
i
returned
hastily
to
the
room
and
we
did
as
we
were
bid
the
room
contained
nothing
but
old
account
books
which
made
a
hot
and
effective
fire
on
the
third
day
the
captain
came
down
himself
into
the
where
i
had
never
seen
him
before
called
me
aside
and
told
me
that
by
mistake
he
had
given
me
the
wrong
key
asking
me
if
i
had
used
it
i
pointed
to
him
the
empty
room
not
a
leaf
was
left
he
turned
pale
with
fright
as
i
saw
his
emotion
he
confided
to
me
the
truth
the
books
were
the
evidences
or
accounts
of
the
british
national
debt
of
what
is
familiarly
known
as
the
consolidated
fund
or
the
consols
they
had
been
secretly
sent
to
new
york
for
the
examination
of
james
fiske
who
had
been
asked
to
advance
a
few
millions
on
this
security
to
the
english
exchequer
and
now
all
evidence
of
indebtedness
was
gone
the
captain
was
about
to
leap
into
the
sea
but
i
dissuaded
him
i
told
him
to
say
nothing
i
would
keep
his
secret
no
man
else
knew
it
the
government
would
never
utter
it
it
was
safe
in
our
hands
he
reconsidered
his
purpose
we
came
safe
to
port
and
did
nothing
only
on
the
first
which
followed
i
obtained
leave
of
absence
and
visited
the
bank
of
england
to
see
what
happened
at
the
door
was
this
placard
applicants
for
dividends
will
file
a
written
application
with
name
and
amount
at
desk
a
and
proceed
in
turn
to
the
paying
teller
office
i
saw
their
ingenuity
they
were
making
out
new
books
certain
that
none
would
apply
but
those
who
were
accustomed
to
so
skilfully
do
men
of
government
study
human
nature
i
stepped
lightly
to
one
of
the
public
desks
i
took
one
of
the
blanks
i
filled
it
out
john
blatchford
and
handed
it
in
at
the
open
trap
i
took
my
place
in
the
queue
in
the
teller
room
after
an
agreeable
hour
a
pile
not
thick
of
bank
of
england
notes
was
given
to
me
and
since
that
day
i
have
quarterly
drawn
that
amount
from
the
maternal
government
of
that
country
as
i
left
the
teller
room
i
observed
the
captain
in
the
queue
he
was
the
seventh
man
from
the
window
and
i
have
never
seen
him
more
we
then
asked
hosanna
for
her
story
the
historical
genealogist
story
my
story
said
she
will
take
us
far
back
into
the
past
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
dwell
on
some
incidents
in
the
first
settlement
of
this
country
and
i
propose
that
we
first
prepare
and
enjoy
the
christmas
tree
after
this
if
your
courage
holds
you
shall
hear
an
tale
pretty
creature
how
little
she
knew
what
was
before
us
as
we
had
sat
listening
to
the
stories
we
had
been
preparing
for
the
tree
shopping
being
out
of
the
question
we
were
fain
from
our
own
stores
to
make
up
our
presents
while
the
women
were
arranging
nuts
and
blown
and
popcorn
strings
from
the
stores
of
the
eagle
and
star
the
popping
of
corn
in
two
had
gone
on
through
the
whole
of
the
all
being
so
nearly
ready
i
called
the
drowsy
boy
again
and
showing
him
a
very
large
stick
in
the
asked
him
to
bring
me
a
hatchet
to
my
great
joy
he
brought
the
axe
of
the
establishment
and
i
bade
him
farewell
how
little
did
he
think
what
was
before
him
so
soon
as
he
had
gone
i
went
stealthily
down
the
stairs
and
stepping
out
into
the
deep
snow
in
front
of
the
hotel
looked
up
into
the
lovely
night
the
storm
had
ceased
and
i
could
see
far
back
into
the
heavens
in
the
still
evening
my
strokes
might
have
been
heard
far
and
wide
as
i
cut
down
one
of
the
two
pretty
norways
that
shaded
pynchon
front
walk
next
the
hotel
i
dragged
it
over
the
snow
blatchford
and
steele
lowered
sheets
to
me
from
the
large
parlor
window
which
i
attached
to
the
larger
end
of
the
tree
with
infinite
difficulty
they
hauled
it
in
i
joined
them
in
the
parlor
and
soon
we
had
as
stately
a
tree
growing
there
as
was
in
any
home
of
joy
that
night
in
the
river
counties
with
swift
fingers
did
our
wives
adorn
it
i
should
have
said
above
that
we
travelled
with
our
wives
and
that
i
would
recommend
that
custom
to
others
it
was
impossible
under
the
circumstances
to
maintain
much
secrecy
but
it
had
been
agreed
that
all
who
wished
to
turn
their
backs
to
the
circle
in
the
preparation
of
presents
might
do
so
without
offence
to
the
others
as
the
presents
were
wrapped
one
by
one
in
paper
of
different
colors
they
were
marked
with
the
names
of
giver
and
receiver
and
placed
in
a
large
at
last
all
was
done
i
had
wrapped
up
my
knife
my
my
lettercase
for
steele
blatchford
and
dick
to
my
wife
i
gave
my
gold
which
fortunately
fits
her
watch
to
hosanna
a
mere
trifle
a
seal
ring
i
wore
to
bertha
my
gold
chain
and
to
sarah
blatchford
the
watch
which
generally
hung
from
it
for
a
few
moments
we
retired
to
our
rooms
while
the
pretty
hosanna
arranged
the
presents
on
the
tree
then
she
clapped
her
hands
and
we
rushed
in
what
a
wondrous
sight
what
a
shout
of
infantine
laughter
and
charming
prattle
for
in
that
happy
moment
were
we
not
all
children
again
i
see
my
story
hurries
to
its
close
dick
who
is
the
tallest
mounted
a
and
called
us
by
name
to
receive
our
presents
i
had
a
nice
gold
from
hosanna
a
knife
from
steele
a
from
phebe
and
a
pretty
from
bertha
dick
had
given
me
his
which
he
knew
i
fancied
sarah
blatchford
a
little
toy
of
a
geneva
watch
she
wore
and
her
husband
a
handsome
seal
ring
a
present
to
him
from
the
czar
i
believe
phebe
that
is
my
wife
for
we
were
travelling
with
our
wives
had
a
from
steele
a
pretty
little
from
dick
a
from
me
and
a
french
repeater
from
blatchford
sarah
blatchford
gave
her
the
knife
she
carried
with
some
bright
verses
saying
that
it
was
not
to
cut
love
bertha
a
and
hosanna
a
ring
of
turquoise
and
amethysts
the
other
presents
were
similar
articles
and
were
received
as
they
were
given
with
much
tender
feeling
but
at
this
moment
as
dick
was
on
the
top
of
the
flight
of
steps
handing
down
a
red
apple
from
the
tree
a
slight
catastrophe
occurred
the
first
thing
i
was
conscious
of
was
the
angry
hiss
of
steam
in
a
moment
i
perceived
that
the
from
which
the
tavern
was
warmed
had
exploded
the
floor
beneath
us
rose
and
we
were
driven
with
it
through
the
ceiling
and
the
rooms
above
through
an
opening
in
the
roof
into
the
still
night
around
us
in
the
air
were
flying
all
the
other
contents
and
occupants
of
the
star
and
eagle
how
bitterly
was
i
reminded
of
dick
flight
from
the
railroad
track
of
the
ithaca
and
owego
railroad
but
i
could
not
hope
such
an
escape
as
his
still
my
flight
was
in
a
parabola
and
in
a
period
not
longer
than
it
has
taken
to
describe
it
i
was
thrown
senseless
at
last
into
a
deep
near
the
united
states
arsenal
tender
hands
lifted
me
and
assuaged
me
tender
teams
carried
me
to
the
city
hospital
tender
eyes
brooded
over
me
tender
science
cared
for
me
it
proved
necessary
before
i
recovered
to
amputate
my
two
legs
at
the
hips
my
right
arm
was
wholly
removed
by
a
delicate
and
curious
operation
from
the
socket
we
saved
the
stump
of
my
left
arm
which
was
amputated
just
below
the
shoulder
i
am
still
in
the
hospital
to
recruit
my
strength
the
doctor
does
not
like
to
have
me
occupy
my
mind
at
all
but
he
says
there
is
no
harm
in
my
compiling
my
memoirs
or
writing
magazine
stories
my
faithful
nurse
has
laid
me
on
my
breast
on
a
pillow
has
put
a
pencil
in
my
mouth
and
feeling
almost
personally
acquainted
with
john
carter
the
artist
i
have
written
out
for
you
in
his
method
the
story
of
my
last
christmas
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
the
others
have
never
been
found
