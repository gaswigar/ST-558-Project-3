all
true
histories
contain
instruction
though
in
some
the
treasure
may
be
hard
to
find
and
when
found
so
trivial
in
quantity
that
the
dry
shrivelled
kernel
scarcely
compensates
for
the
trouble
of
cracking
the
nut
whether
this
be
the
case
with
my
history
or
not
i
am
hardly
competent
to
judge
i
sometimes
think
it
might
prove
useful
to
some
and
entertaining
to
others
but
the
world
may
judge
for
itself
shielded
by
my
own
obscurity
and
by
the
lapse
of
years
and
a
few
fictitious
names
i
do
not
fear
to
venture
and
will
candidly
lay
before
the
public
what
i
would
not
disclose
to
the
most
intimate
friend
my
father
was
a
clergyman
of
the
north
of
england
who
was
deservedly
respected
by
all
who
knew
him
and
in
his
younger
days
lived
pretty
comfortably
on
the
joint
income
of
a
small
incumbency
and
a
snug
little
property
of
his
own
my
mother
who
married
him
against
the
wishes
of
her
friends
was
a
squire
s
daughter
and
a
woman
of
spirit
in
vain
it
was
represented
to
her
that
if
she
became
the
poor
parson
s
wife
she
must
relinquish
her
carriage
and
her
lady
and
all
the
luxuries
and
elegancies
of
affluence
which
to
her
were
little
less
than
the
necessaries
of
life
a
carriage
and
a
lady
were
great
conveniences
but
thank
heaven
she
had
feet
to
carry
her
and
hands
to
minister
to
her
own
necessities
an
elegant
house
and
spacious
grounds
were
not
to
be
despised
but
she
would
rather
live
in
a
cottage
with
richard
grey
than
in
a
palace
with
any
other
man
in
the
world
finding
arguments
of
no
avail
her
father
at
length
told
the
lovers
they
might
marry
if
they
pleased
but
in
so
doing
his
daughter
would
forfeit
every
fraction
of
her
fortune
he
expected
this
would
cool
the
ardour
of
both
but
he
was
mistaken
my
father
knew
too
well
my
mother
s
superior
worth
not
to
be
sensible
that
she
was
a
valuable
fortune
in
herself
and
if
she
would
but
consent
to
embellish
his
humble
hearth
he
should
be
happy
to
take
her
on
any
terms
while
she
on
her
part
would
rather
labour
with
her
own
hands
than
be
divided
from
the
man
she
loved
whose
happiness
it
would
be
her
joy
to
make
and
who
was
already
one
with
her
in
heart
and
soul
so
her
fortune
went
to
swell
the
purse
of
a
wiser
sister
who
had
married
a
rich
nabob
and
she
to
the
wonder
and
compassionate
regret
of
all
who
knew
her
went
to
bury
herself
in
the
homely
village
parsonage
among
the
hills
of
and
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
and
in
spite
of
my
mother
s
high
spirit
and
my
father
s
whims
i
believe
you
might
search
all
england
through
and
fail
to
find
a
happier
couple
of
six
children
my
sister
mary
and
myself
were
the
only
two
that
survived
the
perils
of
infancy
and
early
childhood
i
being
the
younger
by
five
or
six
years
was
always
regarded
as
child
and
the
pet
of
the
family
father
mother
and
sister
all
combined
to
spoil
by
foolish
indulgence
to
render
me
fractious
and
ungovernable
but
by
ceaseless
kindness
to
make
me
too
helpless
and
unfit
for
buffeting
with
the
cares
and
turmoils
of
life
mary
and
i
were
brought
up
in
the
strictest
seclusion
my
mother
being
at
once
highly
accomplished
well
informed
and
fond
of
employment
took
the
whole
charge
of
our
education
on
herself
with
the
exception
of
my
father
undertook
to
teach
that
we
never
even
went
to
school
and
as
there
was
no
society
in
the
neighbourhood
our
only
intercourse
with
the
world
consisted
in
a
stately
now
and
then
with
the
principal
farmers
and
tradespeople
of
the
vicinity
just
to
avoid
being
stigmatized
as
too
proud
to
consort
with
our
neighbours
and
an
annual
visit
to
our
paternal
grandfather
s
where
himself
our
kind
grandmamma
a
maiden
aunt
and
two
or
three
elderly
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
the
only
persons
we
ever
saw
sometimes
our
mother
would
amuse
us
with
stories
and
anecdotes
of
her
younger
days
which
while
they
entertained
us
amazingly
frequently
at
secret
wish
to
see
a
little
more
of
the
world
i
thought
she
must
have
been
very
happy
but
she
never
seemed
to
regret
past
times
my
father
however
whose
temper
was
neither
tranquil
nor
cheerful
by
nature
often
unduly
vexed
himself
with
thinking
of
the
sacrifices
his
dear
wife
had
made
for
him
and
troubled
his
head
with
revolving
endless
schemes
for
the
augmentation
of
his
little
fortune
for
her
sake
and
ours
in
vain
my
mother
assured
him
she
was
quite
satisfied
and
if
he
would
but
lay
by
a
little
for
the
children
we
should
all
have
plenty
both
for
time
present
and
to
come
but
saving
was
not
my
father
s
forte
he
would
not
run
in
debt
at
least
my
mother
took
good
care
he
should
not
but
while
he
had
money
he
must
spend
it
he
liked
to
see
his
house
comfortable
and
his
wife
and
daughters
well
clothed
and
well
attended
and
besides
he
was
charitably
disposed
and
liked
to
give
to
the
poor
according
to
his
means
or
as
some
might
think
beyond
them
at
length
however
a
kind
friend
suggested
to
him
a
means
of
doubling
his
private
property
at
one
stroke
and
further
increasing
it
hereafter
to
an
untold
amount
this
friend
was
a
merchant
a
man
of
enterprising
spirit
and
undoubted
talent
who
was
somewhat
straitened
in
his
mercantile
pursuits
for
want
of
capital
but
generously
proposed
to
give
my
father
a
fair
share
of
his
profits
if
he
would
only
entrust
him
with
what
he
could
spare
and
he
thought
he
might
safely
promise
that
whatever
sum
the
latter
chose
to
put
into
his
hands
it
should
bring
him
in
cent
per
cent
the
small
patrimony
was
speedily
sold
and
the
whole
of
its
price
was
deposited
in
the
hands
of
the
friendly
merchant
who
as
promptly
proceeded
to
ship
his
cargo
and
prepare
for
his
voyage
my
father
was
delighted
so
were
we
all
with
our
brightening
prospects
for
the
present
it
is
true
we
were
reduced
to
the
narrow
income
of
the
curacy
but
my
father
seemed
to
think
there
was
no
necessity
for
scrupulously
restricting
our
expenditure
to
that
so
with
a
standing
bill
at
jackson
s
another
at
smith
s
and
a
third
at
hobson
s
we
got
along
even
more
comfortably
than
before
though
my
mother
affirmed
we
had
better
keep
within
bounds
for
our
prospects
of
wealth
were
but
precarious
after
all
and
if
my
father
would
only
trust
everything
to
her
management
he
should
never
feel
himself
stinted
but
he
for
once
was
incorrigible
what
happy
hours
mary
and
i
have
passed
while
sitting
at
our
work
by
the
fire
or
wandering
on
the
hills
or
idling
under
the
weeping
birch
the
only
considerable
tree
in
the
garden
talking
of
future
happiness
to
ourselves
and
our
parents
of
what
we
would
do
and
see
and
possess
with
no
firmer
foundation
for
our
goodly
superstructure
than
the
riches
that
were
expected
to
flow
in
upon
us
from
the
success
of
the
worthy
merchant
s
speculations
our
father
was
nearly
as
bad
as
ourselves
only
that
he
affected
not
to
be
so
much
in
earnest
expressing
his
bright
hopes
and
sanguine
expectations
in
jests
and
playful
sallies
that
always
struck
me
as
being
exceedingly
witty
and
pleasant
our
mother
laughed
with
delight
to
see
him
so
hopeful
and
happy
but
still
she
feared
he
was
setting
his
heart
too
much
upon
the
matter
and
once
i
heard
her
whisper
as
she
left
the
room
god
grant
he
be
not
disappointed
i
know
not
how
he
would
bear
disappointed
he
was
and
bitterly
too
it
came
like
a
on
us
all
that
the
vessel
which
contained
our
fortune
had
been
wrecked
and
gone
to
the
bottom
with
all
its
stores
together
with
several
of
the
crew
and
the
unfortunate
merchant
himself
i
was
grieved
for
him
i
was
grieved
for
the
overthrow
of
all
our
castles
but
with
the
elasticity
of
youth
i
soon
recovered
the
shock
though
riches
had
charms
poverty
had
no
terrors
for
an
inexperienced
girl
like
me
indeed
to
say
the
truth
there
was
something
exhilarating
in
the
idea
of
being
driven
to
straits
and
thrown
upon
our
own
resources
i
only
wished
papa
mamma
and
mary
were
all
of
the
same
mind
as
myself
and
then
instead
of
lamenting
past
calamities
we
might
all
cheerfully
set
to
work
to
remedy
them
and
the
greater
the
difficulties
the
harder
our
present
privations
the
greater
should
be
our
cheerfulness
to
endure
the
latter
and
our
vigour
to
contend
against
the
former
mary
did
not
lament
but
she
brooded
continually
over
the
misfortune
and
sank
into
a
state
of
dejection
from
which
no
effort
of
mine
could
rouse
her
i
could
not
possibly
bring
her
to
regard
the
matter
on
its
bright
side
as
i
did
and
indeed
i
was
so
fearful
of
being
charged
with
childish
frivolity
or
stupid
insensibility
that
i
carefully
kept
most
of
my
bright
ideas
and
cheering
notions
to
myself
well
knowing
they
could
not
be
appreciated
my
mother
thought
only
of
consoling
my
father
and
paying
our
debts
and
retrenching
our
expenditure
by
every
available
means
but
my
father
was
completely
overwhelmed
by
the
calamity
health
strength
and
spirits
sank
beneath
the
blow
and
he
never
wholly
recovered
them
in
vain
my
mother
strove
to
cheer
him
by
appealing
to
his
piety
to
his
courage
to
his
affection
for
herself
and
us
that
very
affection
was
his
greatest
torment
it
was
for
our
sakes
he
had
so
ardently
longed
to
increase
his
was
our
interest
that
had
lent
such
brightness
to
his
hopes
and
that
imparted
such
bitterness
to
his
present
distress
he
now
tormented
himself
with
remorse
at
having
neglected
my
mother
s
advice
which
would
at
least
have
saved
him
from
the
additional
burden
of
vainly
reproached
himself
for
having
brought
her
from
the
dignity
the
ease
the
luxury
of
her
former
station
to
toil
with
him
through
the
cares
and
toils
of
poverty
it
was
gall
and
wormwood
to
his
soul
to
see
that
splendid
woman
once
so
courted
and
admired
transformed
into
an
active
managing
housewife
with
hands
and
head
continually
occupied
with
household
labours
and
household
economy
the
very
willingness
with
which
she
performed
these
duties
the
cheerfulness
with
which
she
bore
her
reverses
and
the
kindness
which
withheld
her
from
imputing
the
smallest
blame
to
him
were
all
perverted
by
this
ingenious
into
further
aggravations
of
his
sufferings
and
thus
the
mind
preyed
upon
the
body
and
disordered
the
system
of
the
nerves
and
they
in
turn
increased
the
troubles
of
the
mind
till
by
action
and
reaction
his
health
was
seriously
impaired
and
not
one
of
us
could
convince
him
that
the
aspect
of
our
affairs
was
not
half
so
gloomy
so
utterly
hopeless
as
his
morbid
imagination
represented
it
to
be
the
useful
pony
phaeton
was
sold
together
with
the
stout
old
favourite
that
we
had
fully
determined
should
end
its
days
in
peace
and
never
pass
from
our
hands
the
little
and
stable
were
let
the
servant
boy
and
the
more
efficient
being
the
more
expensive
of
the
two
were
dismissed
our
clothes
were
mended
turned
and
darned
to
the
utmost
verge
of
decency
our
food
always
plain
was
now
simplified
to
an
unprecedented
my
father
s
favourite
dishes
our
coals
and
candles
were
painfully
pair
of
candles
reduced
to
one
and
that
most
sparingly
used
the
coals
carefully
husbanded
in
the
grate
especially
when
my
father
was
out
on
his
parish
duties
or
confined
to
bed
through
we
sat
with
our
feet
on
the
fender
scraping
the
perishing
embers
together
from
time
to
time
and
occasionally
adding
a
slight
scattering
of
the
dust
and
fragments
of
coal
just
to
keep
them
alive
as
for
our
carpets
they
in
time
were
worn
threadbare
and
patched
and
darned
even
to
a
greater
extent
than
our
garments
to
save
the
expense
of
a
gardener
mary
and
i
undertook
to
keep
the
garden
in
order
and
all
the
cooking
and
household
work
that
could
not
easily
be
managed
by
one
was
done
by
my
mother
and
sister
with
a
little
occasional
help
from
me
only
a
little
because
though
a
woman
in
my
own
estimation
i
was
still
a
child
in
theirs
and
my
mother
like
most
active
managing
women
was
not
gifted
with
very
active
daughters
for
this
being
so
clever
and
diligent
herself
she
was
never
tempted
to
trust
her
affairs
to
a
deputy
but
on
the
contrary
was
willing
to
act
and
think
for
others
as
well
as
for
number
one
and
whatever
was
the
business
in
hand
she
was
apt
to
think
that
no
one
could
do
it
so
well
as
herself
so
that
whenever
i
offered
to
assist
her
i
received
such
an
answer
no
love
you
can
not
s
nothing
here
you
can
do
go
and
help
your
sister
or
get
her
to
take
a
walk
with
her
she
must
not
sit
so
much
and
stay
so
constantly
in
the
house
as
she
may
well
look
thin
and
mary
mamma
says
i
m
to
help
you
or
get
you
to
take
a
walk
with
me
she
says
you
may
well
look
thin
and
dejected
if
you
sit
so
constantly
in
the
help
me
you
can
not
agnes
and
i
can
not
go
out
with
have
far
too
much
to
then
let
me
help
you
can
not
indeed
dear
child
go
and
practise
your
music
or
play
with
the
there
was
always
plenty
of
sewing
on
hand
but
i
had
not
been
taught
to
cut
out
a
single
garment
and
except
plain
hemming
and
seaming
there
was
little
i
could
do
even
in
that
line
for
they
both
asserted
that
it
was
far
easier
to
do
the
work
themselves
than
to
prepare
it
for
me
and
besides
they
liked
better
to
see
me
prosecuting
my
studies
or
amusing
was
time
enough
for
me
to
sit
bending
over
my
work
like
a
grave
matron
when
my
favourite
little
pussy
was
become
a
steady
old
cat
under
such
circumstances
although
i
was
not
many
degrees
more
useful
than
the
kitten
my
idleness
was
not
entirely
without
excuse
through
all
our
troubles
i
never
but
once
heard
my
mother
complain
of
our
want
of
money
as
summer
was
coming
on
she
observed
to
mary
and
me
what
a
desirable
thing
it
would
be
for
your
papa
to
spend
a
few
weeks
at
a
i
am
convinced
the
and
the
change
of
scene
would
be
of
incalculable
service
to
him
but
then
you
see
there
s
no
money
she
added
with
a
sigh
we
both
wished
exceedingly
that
the
thing
might
be
done
and
lamented
greatly
that
it
could
not
well
well
said
she
it
s
no
use
complaining
possibly
something
might
be
done
to
further
the
project
after
all
mary
you
are
a
beautiful
drawer
what
do
you
say
to
doing
a
few
more
pictures
in
your
best
style
and
getting
them
framed
with
the
drawings
you
have
already
done
and
trying
to
dispose
of
them
to
some
liberal
who
has
the
sense
to
discern
their
merits
mamma
i
should
be
delighted
if
you
think
they
be
sold
and
for
anything
worth
it
s
worth
while
trying
however
my
dear
do
you
procure
the
drawings
and
i
ll
endeavour
to
find
a
i
wish
could
do
something
said
i
you
agnes
well
who
knows
you
draw
pretty
well
too
if
you
choose
some
simple
piece
for
your
subject
i
daresay
you
will
be
able
to
produce
something
we
shall
all
be
proud
to
but
i
have
another
scheme
in
my
head
mamma
and
have
had
long
only
i
did
not
like
to
mention
indeed
pray
tell
us
what
it
i
should
like
to
be
a
my
mother
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
laughed
my
sister
dropped
her
work
in
astonishment
exclaiming
a
governess
agnes
what
can
you
be
dreaming
of
well
i
don
t
see
anything
so
extraordinary
in
it
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
able
to
instruct
great
girls
but
surely
i
could
teach
little
ones
and
i
should
like
it
so
much
i
am
so
fond
of
children
do
let
me
mamma
but
my
love
you
have
not
learned
to
take
care
of
and
young
children
require
more
judgment
and
experience
to
manage
than
elder
but
mamma
i
am
above
eighteen
and
quite
able
to
take
care
of
myself
and
others
too
you
do
not
know
half
the
wisdom
and
prudence
i
possess
because
i
have
never
been
only
think
said
mary
what
would
you
do
in
a
house
full
of
strangers
without
me
or
mamma
to
speak
and
act
for
a
parcel
of
children
besides
yourself
to
attend
to
and
no
one
to
look
to
for
advice
you
would
not
even
know
what
clothes
to
put
you
think
because
i
always
do
as
you
bid
me
i
have
no
judgment
of
my
own
but
only
try
is
all
i
you
shall
see
what
i
can
at
that
moment
my
father
entered
and
the
subject
of
our
discussion
was
explained
to
him
what
my
little
agnes
a
governess
cried
he
and
in
spite
of
his
dejection
he
laughed
at
the
idea
yes
papa
don
t
say
anything
against
it
i
should
like
it
so
much
and
i
am
sure
i
could
manage
but
my
darling
we
could
not
spare
and
a
tear
glistened
in
his
eye
as
he
no
no
afflicted
as
we
are
surely
we
are
not
brought
to
that
pass
oh
no
said
my
mother
there
is
no
necessity
whatever
for
such
a
step
it
is
merely
a
whim
of
her
own
so
you
must
hold
your
tongue
you
naughty
girl
for
though
you
are
so
ready
to
leave
us
you
know
very
well
we
can
not
part
with
i
was
silenced
for
that
day
and
for
many
succeeding
ones
but
still
i
did
not
wholly
relinquish
my
darling
scheme
mary
got
her
drawing
materials
and
steadily
set
to
work
i
got
mine
too
but
while
i
drew
i
thought
of
other
things
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
be
a
governess
to
go
out
into
the
world
to
enter
upon
a
new
life
to
act
for
myself
to
exercise
my
unused
faculties
to
try
my
unknown
powers
to
earn
my
own
maintenance
and
something
to
comfort
and
help
my
father
mother
and
sister
besides
exonerating
them
from
the
provision
of
my
food
and
clothing
to
show
papa
what
his
little
agnes
could
do
to
convince
mamma
and
mary
that
i
was
not
quite
the
helpless
thoughtless
being
they
supposed
and
then
how
charming
to
be
entrusted
with
the
care
and
education
of
children
whatever
others
said
i
felt
i
was
fully
competent
to
the
task
the
clear
remembrance
of
my
own
thoughts
in
early
childhood
would
be
a
surer
guide
than
the
instructions
of
the
most
mature
adviser
i
had
but
to
turn
from
my
little
pupils
to
myself
at
their
age
and
i
should
know
at
once
how
to
win
their
confidence
and
affections
how
to
waken
the
contrition
of
the
erring
how
to
embolden
the
timid
and
console
the
afflicted
how
to
make
virtue
practicable
instruction
desirable
and
religion
lovely
and
comprehensible
task
to
teach
the
young
idea
how
to
shoot
to
train
the
tender
plants
and
watch
their
buds
unfolding
day
by
day
influenced
by
so
many
inducements
i
determined
still
to
persevere
though
the
fear
of
displeasing
my
mother
or
distressing
my
father
s
feelings
prevented
me
from
resuming
the
subject
for
several
days
at
length
again
i
mentioned
it
to
my
mother
in
private
and
with
some
difficulty
got
her
to
promise
to
assist
me
with
her
endeavours
my
father
s
reluctant
consent
was
next
obtained
and
then
though
mary
still
sighed
her
disapproval
my
dear
kind
mother
began
to
look
out
for
a
situation
for
me
she
wrote
to
my
father
s
relations
and
consulted
the
newspaper
own
relations
she
had
long
dropped
all
communication
with
a
formal
interchange
of
occasional
letters
was
all
she
had
ever
had
since
her
marriage
and
she
would
not
at
any
time
have
applied
to
them
in
a
case
of
this
nature
but
so
long
and
so
entire
had
been
my
parents
seclusion
from
the
world
that
many
weeks
elapsed
before
a
suitable
situation
could
be
procured
at
last
to
my
great
joy
it
was
decreed
that
i
should
take
charge
of
the
young
family
of
a
certain
bloomfield
whom
my
kind
prim
aunt
grey
had
known
in
her
youth
and
asserted
to
be
a
very
nice
woman
her
husband
was
a
retired
tradesman
who
had
realized
a
very
comfortable
fortune
but
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
give
a
greater
salary
than
pounds
to
the
instructress
of
his
children
i
however
was
glad
to
accept
this
rather
than
refuse
the
my
parents
were
inclined
to
think
the
better
plan
but
some
weeks
more
were
yet
to
be
devoted
to
preparation
how
long
how
tedious
those
weeks
appeared
to
me
yet
they
were
happy
ones
in
the
of
bright
hopes
and
ardent
expectations
with
what
peculiar
pleasure
i
assisted
at
the
making
of
my
new
clothes
and
subsequently
the
packing
of
my
trunks
but
there
was
a
feeling
of
bitterness
mingling
with
the
latter
occupation
too
and
when
it
was
all
was
ready
for
my
departure
on
the
morrow
and
the
last
night
at
home
sudden
anguish
seemed
to
swell
my
heart
my
dear
friends
looked
so
sad
and
spoke
so
very
kindly
that
i
could
scarcely
keep
my
eyes
from
overflowing
but
i
still
affected
to
be
gay
i
had
taken
my
last
ramble
with
mary
on
the
moors
my
last
walk
in
the
garden
and
round
the
house
i
had
fed
with
her
our
pet
pigeons
for
the
last
pretty
creatures
that
we
had
tamed
to
peck
their
food
from
our
hands
i
had
given
a
farewell
stroke
to
all
their
silky
backs
as
they
crowded
in
my
lap
i
had
tenderly
kissed
my
own
peculiar
favourites
the
pair
of
fantails
i
had
played
my
last
tune
on
the
old
familiar
piano
and
sung
my
last
song
to
papa
not
the
last
i
hoped
but
the
last
for
what
appeared
to
me
a
very
long
time
and
perhaps
when
i
did
these
things
again
it
would
be
with
different
feelings
circumstances
might
be
changed
and
this
house
might
never
be
my
settled
home
again
my
dear
little
friend
the
kitten
would
certainly
be
changed
she
was
already
growing
a
fine
cat
and
when
i
returned
even
for
a
hasty
visit
at
christmas
would
most
likely
have
forgotten
both
her
playmate
and
her
merry
pranks
i
had
romped
with
her
for
the
last
time
and
when
i
stroked
her
soft
bright
fur
while
she
lay
purring
herself
to
sleep
in
my
lap
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
sadness
i
could
not
easily
disguise
then
at
when
i
retired
with
mary
to
our
quiet
little
chamber
where
already
my
drawers
were
cleared
out
and
my
share
of
the
bookcase
was
where
hereafter
she
would
have
to
sleep
alone
in
dreary
solitude
as
she
expressed
heart
sank
more
than
ever
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
selfish
and
wrong
to
persist
in
leaving
her
and
when
i
knelt
once
more
beside
our
little
bed
i
prayed
for
a
blessing
on
her
and
on
my
parents
more
fervently
than
ever
i
had
done
before
to
conceal
my
emotion
i
buried
my
face
in
my
hands
and
they
were
presently
bathed
in
tears
i
perceived
on
rising
that
she
had
been
crying
too
but
neither
of
us
spoke
and
in
silence
we
betook
ourselves
to
our
repose
creeping
more
closely
together
from
the
consciousness
that
we
were
to
part
so
soon
but
the
morning
brought
a
renewal
of
hope
and
spirits
i
was
to
depart
early
that
the
conveyance
which
took
me
a
gig
hired
from
smith
the
draper
grocer
and
of
the
village
might
return
the
same
day
i
rose
washed
dressed
swallowed
a
hasty
breakfast
received
the
fond
embraces
of
my
father
mother
and
sister
kissed
the
the
great
scandal
of
sally
the
hands
with
her
mounted
the
gig
drew
my
veil
over
my
face
and
then
but
not
till
then
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
the
gig
rolled
on
i
looked
back
my
dear
mother
and
sister
were
still
standing
at
the
door
looking
after
me
and
waving
their
adieux
i
returned
their
salute
and
prayed
god
to
bless
them
from
my
heart
we
descended
the
hill
and
i
could
see
them
no
more
it
s
a
coldish
mornin
for
you
miss
agnes
observed
smith
and
a
darksome
un
too
but
we
s
happen
get
to
yon
spot
afore
there
come
much
rain
to
yes
i
hope
so
replied
i
as
calmly
as
i
could
it
s
comed
a
good
sup
last
night
but
this
cold
wind
will
happen
keep
it
perhaps
it
here
ended
our
colloquy
we
crossed
the
valley
and
began
to
ascend
the
opposite
hill
as
we
were
toiling
up
i
looked
back
again
there
was
the
village
spire
and
the
old
grey
parsonage
beyond
it
basking
in
a
slanting
beam
of
was
but
a
sickly
ray
but
the
village
and
surrounding
hills
were
all
in
sombre
shade
and
i
hailed
the
wandering
beam
as
a
propitious
omen
to
my
home
with
clasped
hands
i
fervently
implored
a
blessing
on
its
inhabitants
and
hastily
turned
away
for
i
saw
the
sunshine
was
departing
and
i
carefully
avoided
another
glance
lest
i
should
see
it
in
gloomy
shadow
like
the
rest
of
the
landscape
chapter
lessons
in
the
art
of
instruction
as
we
drove
along
my
spirits
revived
again
and
i
turned
with
pleasure
to
the
contemplation
of
the
new
life
upon
which
i
was
entering
but
though
it
was
not
far
past
the
middle
of
september
the
heavy
clouds
and
strong
wind
combined
to
render
the
day
extremely
cold
and
dreary
and
the
journey
seemed
a
very
long
one
for
as
smith
observed
the
roads
were
very
heavy
and
certainly
his
horse
was
very
heavy
too
it
crawled
up
the
hills
and
crept
down
them
and
only
condescended
to
shake
its
sides
in
a
trot
where
the
road
was
at
a
dead
level
or
a
very
gentle
slope
which
was
rarely
the
case
in
those
rugged
regions
so
that
it
was
nearly
one
o
clock
before
we
reached
the
place
of
our
destination
yet
after
all
when
we
entered
the
lofty
iron
gateway
when
we
drove
softly
up
the
smooth
with
the
green
lawn
on
each
side
studded
with
young
trees
and
approached
the
new
but
stately
mansion
of
wellwood
rising
above
its
mushroom
my
heart
failed
me
and
i
wished
it
were
a
mile
or
two
farther
off
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
must
stand
alone
there
was
no
retreating
now
i
must
enter
that
house
and
introduce
myself
among
its
strange
inhabitants
but
how
was
it
to
be
done
true
i
was
near
nineteen
but
thanks
to
my
retired
life
and
the
protecting
care
of
my
mother
and
sister
i
well
knew
that
many
a
girl
of
fifteen
or
under
was
gifted
with
a
more
womanly
address
and
greater
ease
and
than
i
was
yet
if
bloomfield
were
a
kind
motherly
woman
i
might
do
very
well
after
all
and
the
children
of
course
i
should
soon
be
at
ease
with
bloomfield
i
hoped
i
should
have
but
little
to
do
with
be
calm
be
calm
whatever
happens
i
said
within
myself
and
truly
i
kept
this
resolution
so
well
and
was
so
fully
occupied
in
steadying
my
nerves
and
stifling
the
rebellious
flutter
of
my
heart
that
when
i
was
admitted
into
the
hall
and
ushered
into
the
presence
of
bloomfield
i
almost
forgot
to
answer
her
polite
salutation
and
it
afterwards
struck
me
that
the
little
i
did
say
was
spoken
in
the
tone
of
one
or
the
lady
too
was
somewhat
chilly
in
her
manner
as
i
discovered
when
i
had
time
to
reflect
she
was
a
tall
spare
stately
woman
with
thick
black
hair
cold
grey
eyes
and
extremely
sallow
complexion
with
due
politeness
however
she
showed
me
my
bedroom
and
left
me
there
to
take
a
little
refreshment
i
was
somewhat
dismayed
at
my
appearance
on
looking
in
the
glass
the
cold
wind
had
swelled
and
reddened
my
hands
uncurled
and
entangled
my
hair
and
dyed
my
face
of
a
pale
purple
add
to
this
my
collar
was
horridly
crumpled
my
frock
splashed
with
mud
my
feet
clad
in
stout
new
boots
and
as
the
trunks
were
not
brought
up
there
was
no
remedy
so
having
smoothed
my
hair
as
well
as
i
could
and
repeatedly
twitched
my
obdurate
collar
i
proceeded
to
clomp
down
the
two
flights
of
stairs
philosophizing
as
i
went
and
with
some
difficulty
found
my
way
into
the
room
where
bloomfield
awaited
me
she
led
me
into
the
where
the
family
luncheon
had
been
laid
out
some
beefsteaks
and
potatoes
were
set
before
me
and
while
i
dined
upon
these
she
sat
opposite
watching
me
as
i
thought
and
endeavouring
to
sustain
something
like
a
chiefly
of
a
succession
of
commonplace
remarks
expressed
with
frigid
formality
but
this
might
be
more
my
fault
than
hers
for
i
really
could
converse
in
fact
my
attention
was
almost
wholly
absorbed
in
my
dinner
not
from
ravenous
appetite
but
from
distress
at
the
toughness
of
the
beefsteaks
and
the
numbness
of
my
hands
almost
palsied
by
their
exposure
to
the
bitter
wind
i
would
gladly
have
eaten
the
potatoes
and
let
the
meat
alone
but
having
got
a
large
piece
of
the
latter
on
to
my
plate
i
could
not
be
so
impolite
as
to
leave
it
so
after
many
awkward
and
unsuccessful
attempts
to
cut
it
with
the
knife
or
tear
it
with
the
fork
or
pull
it
asunder
between
them
sensible
that
the
awful
lady
was
a
spectator
to
the
whole
transaction
i
at
last
desperately
grasped
the
knife
and
fork
in
my
fists
like
a
child
of
two
years
old
and
fell
to
work
with
all
the
little
strength
i
possessed
but
this
needed
some
a
feeble
attempt
at
a
laugh
i
said
my
hands
are
so
benumbed
with
the
cold
that
i
can
scarcely
handle
my
knife
and
i
daresay
you
would
find
it
cold
replied
she
with
a
cool
immutable
gravity
that
did
not
serve
to
reassure
me
when
the
ceremony
was
concluded
she
led
me
into
the
again
where
she
rang
and
sent
for
the
children
you
will
find
them
not
very
far
advanced
in
their
attainments
said
she
for
i
have
had
so
little
time
to
attend
to
their
education
myself
and
we
have
thought
them
too
young
for
a
governess
till
now
but
i
think
they
are
clever
children
and
very
apt
to
learn
especially
the
little
boy
he
is
i
think
the
flower
of
the
generous
boy
one
to
be
led
but
not
driven
and
remarkable
for
always
speaking
the
truth
he
seems
to
scorn
deception
this
was
good
news
his
sister
mary
ann
will
require
watching
continued
she
but
she
is
a
very
good
girl
upon
the
whole
though
i
wish
her
to
be
kept
out
of
the
nursery
as
much
as
possible
as
she
is
now
almost
six
years
old
and
might
acquire
bad
habits
from
the
nurses
i
have
ordered
her
crib
to
be
placed
in
your
room
and
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
overlook
her
washing
and
dressing
and
take
charge
of
her
clothes
she
need
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
the
nursery
i
replied
i
was
quite
willing
to
do
so
and
at
that
moment
my
young
pupils
entered
the
apartment
with
their
two
younger
sisters
master
tom
bloomfield
was
a
boy
of
seven
with
a
somewhat
wiry
frame
flaxen
hair
blue
eyes
small
nose
and
fair
complexion
mary
ann
was
a
tall
girl
too
somewhat
dark
like
her
mother
but
with
a
round
full
face
and
a
high
colour
in
her
cheeks
the
second
sister
was
fanny
a
very
pretty
little
girl
bloomfield
assured
me
she
was
a
remarkably
gentle
child
and
required
encouragement
she
had
not
learned
anything
yet
but
in
a
few
days
she
would
be
four
years
old
and
then
she
might
take
her
first
lesson
in
the
alphabet
and
be
promoted
to
the
schoolroom
the
remaining
one
was
harriet
a
little
broad
fat
merry
playful
thing
of
scarcely
two
that
i
coveted
more
than
all
the
with
her
i
had
nothing
to
do
i
talked
to
my
little
pupils
as
well
as
i
could
and
tried
to
render
myself
agreeable
but
with
little
success
i
fear
for
their
mother
s
presence
kept
me
under
an
unpleasant
restraint
they
however
were
remarkably
free
from
shyness
they
seemed
bold
lively
children
and
i
hoped
i
should
soon
be
on
friendly
terms
with
little
boy
especially
of
whom
i
had
heard
such
a
favourable
character
from
his
mamma
in
mary
ann
there
was
a
certain
affected
simper
and
a
craving
for
notice
that
i
was
sorry
to
observe
but
her
brother
claimed
all
my
attention
to
himself
he
stood
bolt
upright
between
me
and
the
fire
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
talking
away
like
an
orator
occasionally
interrupting
his
discourse
with
a
sharp
reproof
to
his
sisters
when
they
made
too
much
noise
oh
tom
what
a
darling
you
are
exclaimed
his
mother
come
and
kiss
dear
mamma
and
then
won
t
you
show
miss
grey
your
schoolroom
and
your
nice
new
books
i
won
t
kiss
mamma
but
i
show
miss
grey
my
schoolroom
and
my
new
and
schoolroom
and
new
books
tom
said
mary
ann
they
re
mine
they
re
replied
he
decisively
come
along
miss
ll
escort
when
the
room
and
books
had
been
shown
with
some
bickerings
between
the
brother
and
sister
that
i
did
my
utmost
to
appease
or
mitigate
mary
ann
brought
me
her
doll
and
began
to
be
very
loquacious
on
the
subject
of
its
fine
clothes
its
bed
its
chest
of
drawers
and
other
appurtenances
but
tom
told
her
to
hold
her
clamour
that
miss
grey
might
see
his
which
with
a
most
important
bustle
he
dragged
forth
from
its
corner
into
the
middle
of
the
room
loudly
calling
on
me
to
attend
to
it
then
ordering
his
sister
to
hold
the
reins
he
mounted
and
made
me
stand
for
ten
minutes
watching
how
manfully
he
used
his
whip
and
spurs
meantime
however
i
admired
mary
ann
s
pretty
doll
and
all
its
possessions
and
then
told
master
tom
he
was
a
capital
rider
but
i
hoped
he
would
not
use
his
whip
and
spurs
so
much
when
he
rode
a
real
pony
oh
yes
i
will
said
he
laying
on
with
redoubled
ardour
i
ll
cut
into
him
like
smoke
eeh
my
word
but
he
shall
sweat
for
this
was
very
shocking
but
i
hoped
in
time
to
be
able
to
work
a
reformation
now
you
must
put
on
your
bonnet
and
shawl
said
the
little
hero
and
i
ll
show
you
my
and
said
mary
ann
tom
lifted
his
fist
with
a
menacing
gesture
she
uttered
a
loud
shrill
scream
ran
to
the
other
side
of
me
and
made
a
face
at
him
surely
tom
you
would
not
strike
your
sister
i
hope
i
shall
see
you
do
you
will
sometimes
i
m
obliged
to
do
it
now
and
then
to
keep
her
in
but
it
is
not
your
business
to
keep
her
in
order
you
is
well
now
go
and
put
on
your
i
don
t
is
so
very
cloudy
and
cold
it
seems
likely
to
rain
you
know
i
have
had
a
long
no
come
i
shall
allow
of
no
excuses
replied
the
consequential
little
gentleman
and
as
it
was
the
first
day
of
our
acquaintance
i
thought
i
might
as
well
indulge
him
it
was
too
cold
for
mary
ann
to
venture
so
she
stayed
with
her
mamma
to
the
great
relief
of
her
brother
who
liked
to
have
me
all
to
himself
the
garden
was
a
large
one
and
tastefully
laid
out
besides
several
splendid
dahlias
there
were
some
other
fine
flowers
still
in
bloom
but
my
companion
would
not
give
me
time
to
examine
them
i
must
go
with
him
across
the
wet
grass
to
a
remote
sequestered
corner
the
most
important
place
in
the
grounds
because
it
contained
garden
there
were
two
round
beds
stocked
with
a
variety
of
plants
in
one
there
was
a
pretty
little
i
paused
to
admire
its
lovely
blossoms
oh
never
mind
that
said
he
contemptuously
that
s
only
ann
garden
look
this
is
after
i
had
observed
every
flower
and
listened
to
a
disquisition
on
every
plant
i
was
permitted
to
depart
but
first
with
great
pomp
he
plucked
a
polyanthus
and
presented
it
to
me
as
one
conferring
a
prodigious
favour
i
observed
on
the
grass
about
his
garden
certain
apparatus
of
sticks
and
corn
and
asked
what
they
were
traps
for
why
do
you
catch
them
papa
says
they
do
and
what
do
you
do
with
them
when
you
catch
them
different
things
sometimes
i
give
them
to
the
cat
sometimes
i
cut
them
in
pieces
with
my
penknife
but
the
next
i
mean
to
roast
and
why
do
you
mean
to
do
such
a
horrible
thing
for
two
reasons
first
to
see
how
long
it
will
then
to
see
what
it
will
taste
but
don
t
you
know
it
is
extremely
wicked
to
do
such
things
remember
the
birds
can
feel
as
well
as
you
and
think
how
would
you
like
it
yourself
oh
that
s
nothing
i
m
not
a
bird
and
i
can
t
feel
what
i
do
to
but
you
will
have
to
feel
it
some
time
tom
you
have
heard
where
wicked
people
go
to
when
they
die
and
if
you
don
t
leave
off
torturing
innocent
birds
remember
you
will
have
to
go
there
and
suffer
just
what
you
have
made
them
oh
pooh
i
shan
t
papa
knows
how
i
treat
them
and
he
never
blames
me
for
it
he
says
it
is
just
what
used
to
do
when
was
a
boy
last
summer
he
gave
me
a
nest
full
of
young
sparrows
and
he
saw
me
pulling
off
their
legs
and
wings
and
heads
and
never
said
anything
except
that
they
were
nasty
things
and
i
must
not
let
them
soil
my
trousers
and
uncle
robson
was
there
too
and
he
laughed
and
said
i
was
a
fine
but
what
would
your
mamma
say
oh
she
doesn
t
care
she
says
it
s
a
pity
to
kill
the
pretty
singing
birds
but
the
naughty
sparrows
and
mice
and
rats
i
may
do
what
i
like
with
so
now
miss
grey
you
see
it
is
i
still
think
it
is
tom
and
perhaps
your
papa
and
mamma
would
think
so
too
if
they
thought
much
about
it
however
i
internally
added
they
may
say
what
they
please
but
i
am
determined
you
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
as
long
as
i
have
power
to
prevent
he
next
took
me
across
the
lawn
to
see
his
and
then
into
the
to
see
his
one
of
which
to
his
great
joy
contained
a
dead
weasel
and
then
into
the
stable
to
see
not
the
fine
but
a
little
rough
colt
which
he
informed
me
had
been
bred
on
purpose
for
him
and
he
was
to
ride
it
as
soon
as
it
was
properly
trained
i
tried
to
amuse
the
little
fellow
and
listened
to
all
his
chatter
as
complacently
as
i
could
for
i
thought
if
he
had
any
affections
at
all
i
would
endeavour
to
win
them
and
then
in
time
i
might
be
able
to
show
him
the
error
of
his
ways
but
i
looked
in
vain
for
that
generous
noble
spirit
his
mother
talked
of
though
i
could
see
he
was
not
without
a
certain
degree
of
quickness
and
penetration
when
he
chose
to
exert
it
when
we
the
house
it
was
nearly
master
tom
told
me
that
as
papa
was
from
home
he
and
i
and
mary
ann
were
to
have
tea
with
mamma
for
a
treat
for
on
such
occasions
she
always
dined
at
with
them
instead
of
at
six
o
clock
soon
after
tea
mary
ann
went
to
bed
but
tom
favoured
us
with
his
company
and
conversation
till
eight
after
he
was
gone
bloomfield
further
enlightened
me
on
the
subject
of
her
children
s
dispositions
and
acquirements
and
on
what
they
were
to
learn
and
how
they
were
to
be
managed
and
cautioned
me
to
mention
their
defects
to
no
one
but
herself
my
mother
had
warned
me
before
to
mention
them
as
little
as
possible
to
for
people
did
not
like
to
be
told
of
their
children
s
faults
and
so
i
concluded
i
was
to
keep
silence
on
them
altogether
about
nine
bloomfield
invited
me
to
partake
of
a
frugal
supper
of
cold
meat
and
bread
i
was
glad
when
that
was
over
and
she
took
her
bedroom
candlestick
and
retired
to
rest
for
though
i
wished
to
be
pleased
with
her
her
company
was
extremely
irksome
to
me
and
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
she
was
cold
grave
and
very
opposite
of
the
kind
matron
my
hopes
had
depicted
her
to
be
chapter
few
more
lessons
i
rose
next
morning
with
a
feeling
of
hopeful
exhilaration
in
spite
of
the
disappointments
already
experienced
but
i
found
the
dressing
of
mary
ann
was
no
light
matter
as
her
abundant
hair
was
to
be
smeared
with
pomade
plaited
in
three
long
tails
and
tied
with
bows
of
ribbon
a
task
my
unaccustomed
fingers
found
great
difficulty
in
performing
she
told
me
her
nurse
could
do
it
in
half
the
time
and
by
keeping
up
a
constant
fidget
of
impatience
contrived
to
render
me
still
longer
when
all
was
done
we
went
into
the
schoolroom
where
i
met
my
other
pupil
and
chatted
with
the
two
till
it
was
time
to
go
down
to
breakfast
that
meal
being
concluded
and
a
few
civil
words
having
been
exchanged
with
bloomfield
we
repaired
to
the
schoolroom
again
and
commenced
the
business
of
the
day
i
found
my
pupils
very
backward
indeed
but
tom
though
averse
to
every
species
of
mental
exertion
was
not
without
abilities
mary
ann
could
scarcely
read
a
word
and
was
so
careless
and
inattentive
that
i
could
hardly
get
on
with
her
at
all
however
by
dint
of
great
labour
and
patience
i
managed
to
get
something
done
in
the
course
of
the
morning
and
then
accompanied
my
young
charge
out
into
the
garden
and
adjacent
grounds
for
a
little
recreation
before
dinner
there
we
got
along
tolerably
together
except
that
i
found
they
had
no
notion
of
going
with
me
i
must
go
with
them
wherever
they
chose
to
lead
me
i
must
run
walk
or
stand
exactly
as
it
suited
their
fancy
this
i
thought
was
reversing
the
order
of
things
and
i
found
it
doubly
disagreeable
as
on
this
as
well
as
subsequent
occasions
they
seemed
to
prefer
the
dirtiest
places
and
the
most
dismal
occupations
but
there
was
no
remedy
either
i
must
follow
them
or
keep
entirely
apart
from
them
and
thus
appear
neglectful
of
my
charge
they
manifested
a
particular
attachment
to
a
well
at
the
bottom
of
the
lawn
where
they
persisted
in
dabbling
with
sticks
and
pebbles
for
above
half
an
hour
i
was
in
constant
fear
that
their
mother
would
see
them
from
the
window
and
blame
me
for
allowing
them
thus
to
draggle
their
clothes
and
wet
their
feet
and
hands
instead
of
taking
exercise
but
no
arguments
commands
or
entreaties
could
draw
them
away
if
did
not
see
them
some
one
else
gentleman
on
horseback
had
entered
the
gate
and
was
proceeding
up
the
road
at
the
distance
of
a
few
paces
from
us
he
paused
and
calling
to
the
children
in
a
waspish
penetrating
tone
bade
them
keep
out
of
that
miss
grey
said
he
i
suppose
it
miss
grey
i
am
surprised
that
you
should
allow
them
to
dirty
their
clothes
in
that
manner
don
t
you
see
how
miss
bloomfield
has
soiled
her
frock
and
that
master
bloomfield
s
socks
are
quite
wet
and
both
of
them
without
gloves
dear
dear
let
me
that
in
future
you
will
keep
them
at
least
so
saying
he
turned
away
and
continued
his
ride
up
to
the
house
this
was
bloomfield
i
was
surprised
that
he
should
nominate
his
children
master
and
miss
bloomfield
and
still
more
so
that
he
should
speak
so
uncivilly
to
me
their
governess
and
a
perfect
stranger
to
himself
presently
the
bell
rang
to
summon
us
in
i
dined
with
the
children
at
one
while
he
and
his
lady
took
their
luncheon
at
the
same
table
his
conduct
there
did
not
greatly
raise
him
in
my
estimation
he
was
a
man
of
ordinary
below
than
rather
thin
than
stout
apparently
between
thirty
and
forty
years
of
age
he
had
a
large
mouth
pale
dingy
complexion
milky
blue
eyes
and
hair
the
colour
of
a
hempen
cord
there
was
a
roast
leg
of
mutton
before
him
he
helped
bloomfield
the
children
and
me
desiring
me
to
cut
up
the
children
s
meat
then
after
twisting
about
the
mutton
in
various
directions
and
eyeing
it
from
different
points
he
pronounced
it
not
fit
to
be
eaten
and
called
for
the
cold
beef
what
is
the
matter
with
the
mutton
my
dear
asked
his
mate
it
is
quite
overdone
don
t
you
taste
bloomfield
that
all
the
goodness
is
roasted
out
of
it
and
can
t
you
see
that
all
that
nice
red
gravy
is
completely
dried
away
well
i
think
the
will
suit
the
beef
was
set
before
him
and
he
began
to
carve
but
with
the
most
rueful
expressions
of
discontent
what
is
the
matter
with
the
bloomfield
i
m
sure
i
thought
it
was
very
and
so
it
very
nice
a
nicer
joint
could
not
be
but
it
is
spoiled
replied
he
dolefully
how
so
how
so
why
don
t
you
see
how
it
is
cut
it
is
quite
shocking
they
must
have
cut
it
wrong
in
the
kitchen
then
for
i
m
sure
i
carved
it
quite
properly
here
no
they
cut
it
wrong
in
the
savages
did
ever
any
one
see
such
a
fine
piece
of
beef
so
completely
ruined
but
remember
that
in
future
when
a
decent
dish
leaves
this
table
they
shall
not
it
in
the
kitchen
remember
bloomfield
notwithstanding
the
ruinous
state
of
the
beef
the
gentleman
managed
to
out
himself
some
delicate
slices
part
of
which
he
ate
in
silence
when
he
next
spoke
it
was
in
a
less
querulous
tone
to
ask
what
there
was
for
dinner
turkey
and
grouse
was
the
concise
reply
and
what
besides
what
kind
of
fish
i
don
t
don
t
cried
he
looking
solemnly
up
from
his
plate
and
suspending
his
knife
and
fork
in
astonishment
no
i
told
the
cook
to
get
some
did
not
particularize
well
that
beats
everything
a
lady
professes
to
keep
house
and
doesn
t
even
know
what
fish
is
for
dinner
professes
to
order
fish
and
doesn
t
specify
what
perhaps
bloomfield
you
will
order
dinner
yourself
in
nothing
more
was
said
and
i
was
very
glad
to
get
out
of
the
room
with
my
pupils
for
i
never
felt
so
ashamed
and
uncomfortable
in
my
life
for
anything
that
was
not
my
own
fault
in
the
afternoon
we
applied
to
lessons
again
then
went
out
again
then
had
tea
in
the
schoolroom
then
i
dressed
mary
ann
for
dessert
and
when
she
and
her
brother
had
gone
down
to
the
i
took
the
opportunity
of
beginning
a
letter
to
my
dear
friends
at
home
but
the
children
came
up
before
i
had
half
completed
it
at
seven
i
had
to
put
mary
ann
to
bed
then
i
played
with
tom
till
eight
when
he
too
went
and
i
finished
my
letter
and
unpacked
my
clothes
which
i
had
hitherto
found
no
opportunity
for
doing
and
finally
went
to
bed
myself
but
this
is
a
very
favourable
specimen
of
a
day
s
proceedings
my
task
of
instruction
and
surveillance
instead
of
becoming
easier
as
my
charges
and
i
got
better
accustomed
to
each
other
became
more
arduous
as
their
characters
unfolded
the
name
of
governess
i
soon
found
was
a
mere
mockery
as
applied
to
me
my
pupils
had
no
more
notion
of
obedience
than
a
wild
unbroken
colt
the
habitual
fear
of
their
father
s
peevish
temper
and
the
dread
of
the
punishments
he
was
wont
to
inflict
when
irritated
kept
them
generally
within
bounds
in
his
immediate
presence
the
girls
too
had
some
fear
of
their
mother
s
anger
and
the
boy
might
occasionally
be
bribed
to
do
as
she
bid
him
by
the
hope
of
reward
but
i
had
no
rewards
to
offer
and
as
for
punishments
i
was
given
to
understand
the
parents
reserved
that
privilege
to
themselves
and
yet
they
expected
me
to
keep
my
pupils
in
order
other
children
might
be
guided
by
the
fear
of
anger
and
the
desire
of
approbation
but
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
had
any
effect
upon
these
master
tom
not
content
with
refusing
to
be
ruled
must
needs
set
up
as
a
ruler
and
manifested
a
determination
to
keep
not
only
his
sisters
but
his
governess
in
order
by
violent
manual
and
pedal
applications
and
as
he
was
a
tall
strong
boy
of
his
years
this
occasioned
no
trifling
inconvenience
a
few
sound
boxes
on
the
ear
on
such
occasions
might
have
settled
the
matter
easily
enough
but
as
in
that
case
he
might
make
up
some
story
to
his
mother
which
she
would
be
sure
to
believe
as
she
had
such
unshaken
faith
in
his
i
had
already
discovered
it
to
be
by
no
means
determined
to
refrain
from
striking
him
even
in
and
in
his
most
violent
moods
my
only
resource
was
to
throw
him
on
his
back
and
hold
his
hands
and
feet
till
the
frenzy
was
somewhat
abated
to
the
difficulty
of
preventing
him
from
doing
what
he
ought
not
was
added
that
of
forcing
him
to
do
what
he
ought
often
he
would
positively
refuse
to
learn
or
to
repeat
his
lessons
or
even
to
look
at
his
book
here
again
a
good
birch
rod
might
have
been
serviceable
but
as
my
powers
were
so
limited
i
must
make
the
best
use
of
what
i
had
as
there
were
no
settled
hours
for
study
and
play
i
resolved
to
give
my
pupils
a
certain
task
which
with
moderate
attention
they
could
perform
in
a
short
time
and
till
this
was
done
however
weary
i
was
or
however
perverse
they
might
be
nothing
short
of
parental
interference
should
induce
me
to
suffer
them
to
leave
the
schoolroom
even
if
i
should
sit
with
my
chair
against
the
door
to
keep
them
in
patience
firmness
and
perseverance
were
my
only
weapons
and
these
i
resolved
to
use
to
the
utmost
i
determined
always
strictly
to
fulfil
the
threats
and
promises
i
made
and
to
that
end
i
must
be
cautious
to
threaten
and
promise
nothing
that
i
could
not
perform
then
i
would
carefully
refrain
from
all
useless
irritability
and
indulgence
of
my
own
when
they
behaved
tolerably
i
would
be
as
kind
and
obliging
as
it
was
in
my
power
to
be
in
order
to
make
the
widest
possible
distinction
between
good
and
bad
conduct
i
would
reason
with
them
too
in
the
simplest
and
most
effective
manner
when
i
reproved
them
or
refused
to
gratify
their
wishes
after
a
glaring
fault
it
should
be
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
their
little
hymns
and
prayers
i
would
make
plain
and
clear
to
their
understanding
when
they
said
their
prayers
at
night
and
asked
pardon
for
their
offences
i
would
remind
them
of
the
sins
of
the
past
day
solemnly
but
in
perfect
kindness
to
avoid
raising
a
spirit
of
opposition
penitential
hymns
should
be
said
by
the
naughty
cheerful
ones
by
the
comparatively
good
and
every
kind
of
instruction
i
would
convey
to
them
as
much
as
possible
by
entertaining
with
no
other
object
than
their
present
amusement
in
view
by
these
means
i
hoped
in
time
both
to
benefit
the
children
and
to
gain
the
approbation
of
their
parents
and
also
to
convince
my
friends
at
home
that
i
was
not
so
wanting
in
skill
and
prudence
as
they
supposed
i
knew
the
difficulties
i
had
to
contend
with
were
great
but
i
knew
at
least
i
believed
unremitting
patience
and
perseverance
could
overcome
them
and
night
and
morning
i
implored
divine
assistance
to
this
end
but
either
the
children
were
so
incorrigible
the
parents
so
unreasonable
or
myself
so
mistaken
in
my
views
or
so
unable
to
carry
them
out
that
my
best
intentions
and
most
strenuous
efforts
seemed
productive
of
no
better
result
than
sport
to
the
children
dissatisfaction
to
their
parents
and
torment
to
myself
the
task
of
instruction
was
as
arduous
for
the
body
as
the
mind
i
had
to
run
after
my
pupils
to
catch
them
to
carry
or
drag
them
to
the
table
and
often
forcibly
to
hold
them
there
till
the
lesson
was
done
tom
i
frequently
put
into
a
corner
seating
myself
before
him
in
a
chair
with
a
book
which
contained
the
little
task
that
must
be
said
or
read
before
he
was
released
in
my
hand
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
push
both
me
and
the
chair
away
so
he
would
stand
twisting
his
body
and
face
into
the
most
grotesque
and
singular
no
doubt
to
an
unconcerned
spectator
but
not
to
uttering
loud
yells
and
doleful
outcries
intended
to
represent
weeping
but
wholly
without
the
accompaniment
of
tears
i
knew
this
was
done
solely
for
the
purpose
of
annoying
me
and
therefore
however
i
might
inwardly
tremble
with
impatience
and
irritation
i
manfully
strove
to
suppress
all
visible
signs
of
molestation
and
affected
to
sit
with
calm
indifference
waiting
till
it
should
please
him
to
cease
this
pastime
and
prepare
for
a
run
in
the
garden
by
casting
his
eye
on
the
book
and
reading
or
repeating
the
few
words
he
was
required
to
say
sometimes
he
was
determined
to
do
his
writing
badly
and
i
had
to
hold
his
hand
to
prevent
him
from
purposely
blotting
or
disfiguring
the
paper
frequently
i
threatened
that
if
he
did
not
do
better
he
should
have
another
line
then
he
would
stubbornly
refuse
to
write
this
line
and
i
to
save
my
word
had
finally
to
resort
to
the
expedient
of
holding
his
fingers
upon
the
pen
and
forcibly
drawing
his
hand
up
and
down
till
in
spite
of
his
resistance
the
line
was
in
some
sort
completed
yet
tom
was
by
no
means
the
most
unmanageable
of
my
pupils
sometimes
to
my
great
joy
he
would
have
the
sense
to
see
that
his
wisest
policy
was
to
finish
his
tasks
and
go
out
and
amuse
himself
till
i
and
his
sisters
came
to
join
him
which
frequently
was
not
at
all
for
mary
ann
seldom
followed
his
example
in
this
particular
she
apparently
preferred
rolling
on
the
floor
to
any
other
amusement
down
she
would
drop
like
a
leaden
weight
and
when
i
with
great
difficulty
had
succeeded
in
rooting
her
thence
i
had
still
to
hold
her
up
with
one
arm
while
with
the
other
i
held
the
book
from
which
she
was
to
read
or
spell
her
lesson
as
the
dead
weight
of
the
big
girl
of
six
became
too
heavy
for
one
arm
to
bear
i
transferred
it
to
the
other
or
if
both
were
weary
of
the
burden
i
carried
her
into
a
corner
and
told
her
she
might
come
out
when
she
should
find
the
use
of
her
feet
and
stand
up
but
she
generally
preferred
lying
there
like
a
log
till
dinner
or
when
as
i
could
not
deprive
her
of
her
meals
she
must
be
liberated
and
would
come
crawling
out
with
a
grin
of
triumph
on
her
round
red
face
often
she
would
stubbornly
refuse
to
pronounce
some
particular
word
in
her
lesson
and
now
i
regret
the
lost
labour
i
have
had
in
striving
to
conquer
her
obstinacy
if
i
had
passed
it
over
as
a
matter
of
no
consequence
it
would
have
been
better
for
both
parties
than
vainly
striving
to
overcome
it
as
i
did
but
i
thought
it
my
absolute
duty
to
crush
this
vicious
tendency
in
the
bud
and
so
it
was
if
i
could
have
done
it
and
had
my
powers
been
less
limited
i
might
have
enforced
obedience
but
as
it
was
it
was
a
trial
of
strength
between
her
and
me
in
which
she
generally
came
off
victorious
and
every
victory
served
to
encourage
and
strengthen
her
for
a
future
contest
in
vain
i
argued
coaxed
entreated
threatened
scolded
in
vain
i
kept
her
in
from
play
or
if
obliged
to
take
her
out
refused
to
play
with
her
or
to
speak
kindly
or
have
anything
to
do
with
her
in
vain
i
tried
to
set
before
her
the
advantages
of
doing
as
she
was
bid
and
being
loved
and
kindly
treated
in
consequence
and
the
disadvantages
of
persisting
in
her
absurd
perversity
sometimes
when
she
would
ask
me
to
do
something
for
her
i
would
answer
yes
i
will
mary
ann
if
you
will
only
say
that
word
come
you
d
better
say
it
at
once
and
have
no
more
trouble
about
then
of
course
i
can
do
nothing
for
with
me
at
her
age
or
under
neglect
and
disgrace
were
the
most
dreadful
of
punishments
but
on
her
they
made
no
impression
sometimes
exasperated
to
the
utmost
pitch
i
would
shake
her
violently
by
the
shoulder
or
pull
her
long
hair
or
put
her
in
the
corner
for
which
she
punished
me
with
loud
shrill
piercing
screams
that
went
through
my
head
like
a
knife
she
knew
i
hated
this
and
when
she
had
shrieked
her
utmost
would
look
into
my
face
with
an
air
of
vindictive
satisfaction
exclaiming
then
for
you
and
then
shriek
again
and
again
till
i
was
forced
to
stop
my
ears
often
these
dreadful
cries
would
bring
bloomfield
up
to
inquire
what
was
the
matter
mary
ann
is
a
naughty
girl
ma
but
what
are
these
shocking
screams
she
is
screaming
in
a
i
never
heard
such
a
dreadful
noise
you
might
be
killing
her
why
is
she
not
out
with
her
brother
i
can
not
get
her
to
finish
her
but
mary
ann
must
be
a
girl
and
finish
her
this
was
blandly
spoken
to
the
child
and
i
hope
i
shall
hear
such
terrible
cries
again
and
fixing
her
cold
stony
eyes
upon
me
with
a
look
that
could
not
be
mistaken
she
would
shut
the
door
and
walk
away
sometimes
i
would
try
to
take
the
little
obstinate
creature
by
surprise
and
casually
ask
her
the
word
while
she
was
thinking
of
something
else
frequently
she
would
begin
to
say
it
and
then
suddenly
check
herself
with
a
provoking
look
that
seemed
to
say
ah
i
m
too
sharp
for
you
you
shan
t
trick
it
out
of
me
on
another
occasion
i
pretended
to
forget
the
whole
affair
and
talked
and
played
with
her
as
usual
till
night
when
i
put
her
to
bed
then
bending
over
her
while
she
lay
all
smiles
and
good
humour
just
before
departing
i
said
as
cheerfully
and
kindly
as
now
mary
ann
just
tell
me
that
word
before
i
kiss
you
you
are
a
good
girl
now
and
of
course
you
will
say
no
i
won
then
i
can
t
kiss
well
i
don
t
in
vain
i
expressed
my
sorrow
in
vain
i
lingered
for
some
symptom
of
contrition
she
really
didn
t
care
and
i
left
her
alone
and
in
darkness
wondering
most
of
all
at
this
last
proof
of
insensate
stubbornness
in
childhood
i
could
not
imagine
a
more
afflictive
punishment
than
for
my
mother
to
refuse
to
kiss
me
at
night
the
very
idea
was
terrible
more
than
the
idea
i
never
felt
for
happily
i
never
committed
a
fault
that
was
deemed
worthy
of
such
penalty
but
once
i
remember
for
some
transgression
of
my
sister
s
our
mother
thought
proper
to
inflict
it
upon
her
what
felt
i
can
not
tell
but
my
sympathetic
tears
and
suffering
for
her
sake
i
shall
not
soon
forget
another
troublesome
trait
in
mary
ann
was
her
incorrigible
propensity
to
keep
running
into
the
nursery
to
play
with
her
little
sisters
and
the
nurse
this
was
natural
enough
but
as
it
was
against
her
mother
s
express
desire
i
of
course
forbade
her
to
do
so
and
did
my
utmost
to
keep
her
with
me
but
that
only
increased
her
relish
for
the
nursery
and
the
more
i
strove
to
keep
her
out
of
it
the
oftener
she
went
and
the
longer
she
stayed
to
the
great
dissatisfaction
of
bloomfield
who
i
well
knew
would
impute
all
the
blame
of
the
matter
to
me
another
of
my
trials
was
the
dressing
in
the
morning
at
one
time
she
would
not
be
washed
at
another
she
would
not
be
dressed
unless
she
might
wear
some
particular
frock
that
i
knew
her
mother
would
not
like
her
to
have
at
another
she
would
scream
and
run
away
if
i
attempted
to
touch
her
hair
so
that
frequently
when
after
much
trouble
and
toil
i
had
at
length
succeeded
in
bringing
her
down
the
breakfast
was
nearly
half
over
and
black
looks
from
mamma
and
testy
observations
from
papa
spoken
at
me
if
not
to
me
were
sure
to
be
my
meed
for
few
things
irritated
the
latter
so
much
as
want
of
punctuality
at
meal
times
then
among
the
minor
annoyances
was
my
inability
to
satisfy
bloomfield
with
her
daughter
s
dress
and
the
child
s
hair
was
never
fit
to
be
sometimes
as
a
powerful
reproach
to
me
she
would
perform
the
office
of
tire
woman
herself
and
then
complain
bitterly
of
the
trouble
it
gave
her
when
little
fanny
came
into
the
schoolroom
i
hoped
she
would
be
mild
and
inoffensive
at
least
but
a
few
days
if
not
a
few
hours
sufficed
to
destroy
the
illusion
i
found
her
a
mischievous
intractable
little
creature
given
up
to
falsehood
and
deception
young
as
she
was
and
alarmingly
fond
of
exercising
her
two
favourite
weapons
of
offence
and
defence
that
of
spitting
in
the
faces
of
those
who
incurred
her
displeasure
and
bellowing
like
a
bull
when
her
unreasonable
desires
were
not
gratified
as
she
generally
was
pretty
quiet
in
her
parents
presence
and
they
were
impressed
with
the
notion
of
her
being
a
remarkably
gentle
child
her
falsehoods
were
readily
believed
and
her
loud
uproars
led
them
to
suspect
harsh
and
injudicious
treatment
on
my
part
and
when
at
length
her
bad
disposition
became
manifest
even
to
their
prejudiced
eyes
i
felt
that
the
whole
was
attributed
to
me
what
a
naughty
girl
fanny
is
getting
bloomfield
would
say
to
her
spouse
don
t
you
observe
my
dear
how
she
is
altered
since
she
entered
the
schoolroom
she
will
soon
be
as
bad
as
the
other
two
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
they
have
quite
deteriorated
of
you
may
say
that
was
the
answer
i
ve
been
thinking
that
same
myself
i
thought
when
we
got
them
a
governess
they
d
improve
but
instead
of
that
they
get
worse
and
worse
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
with
their
learning
but
their
habits
i
know
make
no
sort
of
improvement
they
get
rougher
and
dirtier
and
more
unseemly
every
i
knew
this
was
all
pointed
at
me
and
these
and
all
similar
innuendoes
affected
me
far
more
deeply
than
any
open
accusations
would
have
done
for
against
the
latter
i
should
have
been
roused
to
speak
in
my
own
defence
now
i
judged
it
my
wisest
plan
to
subdue
every
resentful
impulse
suppress
every
sensitive
shrinking
and
go
on
perseveringly
doing
my
best
for
irksome
as
my
situation
was
i
earnestly
wished
to
retain
it
i
thought
if
i
could
struggle
on
with
unremitting
firmness
and
integrity
the
children
would
in
time
become
more
humanized
every
month
would
contribute
to
make
them
some
little
wiser
and
consequently
more
manageable
for
a
child
of
nine
or
ten
as
frantic
and
ungovernable
as
these
at
six
and
seven
would
be
a
maniac
i
flattered
myself
i
was
benefiting
my
parents
and
sister
by
my
continuance
here
for
small
as
the
salary
was
i
still
was
earning
something
and
with
strict
economy
i
could
easily
manage
to
have
something
to
spare
for
them
if
they
would
favour
me
by
taking
it
then
it
was
by
my
own
will
that
i
had
got
the
place
i
had
brought
all
this
tribulation
on
myself
and
i
was
determined
to
bear
it
nay
more
than
that
i
did
not
even
regret
the
step
i
had
taken
i
longed
to
show
my
friends
that
even
now
i
was
competent
to
undertake
the
charge
and
able
to
acquit
myself
honourably
to
the
end
and
if
ever
i
felt
it
degrading
to
submit
so
quietly
or
intolerable
to
toil
so
constantly
i
would
turn
towards
my
home
and
say
within
they
may
crush
but
they
shall
not
subdue
me
tis
of
thee
that
i
think
not
of
them
about
christmas
i
was
allowed
to
visit
home
but
my
holiday
was
only
of
a
fortnight
s
duration
for
said
bloomfield
i
thought
as
you
had
seen
your
friends
so
lately
you
would
not
care
for
a
longer
i
left
her
to
think
so
still
but
she
little
knew
how
long
how
wearisome
those
fourteen
weeks
of
absence
had
been
to
me
how
intensely
i
had
longed
for
my
holidays
how
greatly
i
was
disappointed
at
their
curtailment
yet
she
was
not
to
blame
in
this
i
had
never
told
her
my
feelings
and
she
could
not
be
expected
to
divine
them
i
had
not
been
with
her
a
full
term
and
she
was
justified
in
not
allowing
me
a
full
vacation
chapter
grandmamma
i
spare
my
readers
the
account
of
my
delight
on
coming
home
my
happiness
while
a
brief
space
of
rest
and
liberty
in
that
dear
familiar
place
among
the
loving
and
the
my
sorrow
on
being
obliged
to
bid
them
once
more
a
long
adieu
i
returned
however
with
unabated
vigour
to
my
more
arduous
task
than
anyone
can
imagine
who
has
not
felt
something
like
the
misery
of
being
charged
with
the
care
and
direction
of
a
set
of
mischievous
turbulent
rebels
whom
his
utmost
exertions
can
not
bind
to
their
duty
while
at
the
same
time
he
is
responsible
for
their
conduct
to
a
higher
power
who
exacts
from
him
what
can
not
be
achieved
without
the
aid
of
the
superior
s
more
potent
authority
which
either
from
indolence
or
the
fear
of
becoming
unpopular
with
the
said
rebellious
gang
the
latter
refuses
to
give
i
can
conceive
few
situations
more
harassing
than
that
wherein
however
you
may
long
for
success
however
you
may
labour
to
fulfil
your
duty
your
efforts
are
baffled
and
set
at
nought
by
those
beneath
you
and
unjustly
censured
and
misjudged
by
those
above
i
have
not
enumerated
half
the
vexatious
propensities
of
my
pupils
or
half
the
troubles
resulting
from
my
heavy
responsibilities
for
fear
of
trespassing
too
much
upon
the
reader
s
patience
as
perhaps
i
have
already
done
but
my
design
in
writing
the
few
last
pages
was
not
to
amuse
but
to
benefit
those
whom
it
might
concern
he
that
has
no
interest
in
such
matters
will
doubtless
have
skipped
them
over
with
a
cursory
glance
and
perhaps
a
malediction
against
the
prolixity
of
the
writer
but
if
a
parent
has
therefrom
gathered
any
useful
hint
or
an
unfortunate
governess
received
thereby
the
slightest
benefit
i
am
well
rewarded
for
my
pains
to
avoid
trouble
and
confusion
i
have
taken
my
pupils
one
by
one
and
discussed
their
various
qualities
but
this
can
give
no
adequate
idea
of
being
worried
by
the
whole
three
together
when
as
was
often
the
case
all
were
determined
to
be
naughty
and
to
tease
miss
grey
and
put
her
in
a
sometimes
on
such
occasions
the
thought
has
suddenly
occurred
to
if
they
could
see
me
now
meaning
of
course
my
friends
at
home
and
the
idea
of
how
they
would
pity
me
has
made
me
pity
greatly
that
i
have
had
the
utmost
difficulty
to
restrain
my
tears
but
i
have
restrained
them
till
my
little
tormentors
were
gone
to
dessert
or
cleared
off
to
bed
my
only
prospects
of
deliverance
and
then
in
all
the
bliss
of
solitude
i
have
given
myself
up
to
the
luxury
of
an
unrestricted
burst
of
weeping
but
this
was
a
weakness
i
did
not
often
indulge
my
employments
were
too
numerous
my
leisure
moments
too
precious
to
admit
of
much
time
being
given
to
fruitless
lamentations
i
particularly
remember
one
wild
snowy
afternoon
soon
after
my
return
in
january
the
children
had
all
come
up
from
dinner
loudly
declaring
that
they
meant
to
be
naughty
and
they
had
well
kept
their
resolution
though
i
had
talked
myself
hoarse
and
wearied
every
muscle
in
my
throat
in
the
vain
attempt
to
reason
them
out
of
it
i
had
got
tom
pinned
up
in
a
corner
whence
i
told
him
he
should
not
escape
till
he
had
done
his
appointed
task
meantime
fanny
had
possessed
herself
of
my
and
was
rifling
its
spitting
into
it
besides
i
told
her
to
let
it
alone
but
to
no
purpose
of
course
burn
it
fanny
cried
tom
and
command
she
hastened
to
obey
i
sprang
to
snatch
it
from
the
fire
and
tom
darted
to
the
door
mary
ann
throw
her
desk
out
of
the
window
cried
he
and
my
precious
desk
containing
my
letters
and
papers
my
small
amount
of
cash
and
all
my
valuables
was
about
to
be
precipitated
from
the
window
i
flew
to
rescue
it
meanwhile
tom
had
left
the
room
and
was
rushing
down
the
stairs
followed
by
fanny
having
secured
my
desk
i
ran
to
catch
them
and
mary
ann
came
scampering
after
all
three
escaped
me
and
ran
out
of
the
house
into
the
garden
where
they
plunged
about
in
the
snow
shouting
and
screaming
in
exultant
glee
what
must
i
do
if
i
followed
them
i
should
probably
be
unable
to
capture
one
and
only
drive
them
farther
away
if
i
did
not
how
was
i
to
get
them
in
and
what
would
their
parents
think
of
me
if
they
saw
or
heard
the
children
rioting
hatless
bonnetless
gloveless
and
bootless
in
the
deep
soft
snow
while
i
stood
in
this
perplexity
just
without
the
door
trying
by
grim
looks
and
angry
words
to
awe
them
into
subjection
i
heard
a
voice
behind
me
in
harshly
piercing
tones
exclaiming
miss
grey
is
it
possible
what
in
the
devil
s
name
can
you
be
thinking
about
i
can
t
get
them
in
sir
said
i
turning
round
and
beholding
bloomfield
with
his
hair
on
end
and
his
pale
blue
eyes
bolting
from
their
sockets
but
i
insist
upon
their
being
got
in
cried
he
approaching
nearer
and
looking
perfectly
ferocious
then
sir
you
must
call
them
yourself
if
you
please
for
they
won
t
listen
to
me
i
replied
stepping
back
come
in
with
you
you
filthy
brats
or
i
ll
horsewhip
you
every
one
roared
he
and
the
children
instantly
obeyed
there
you
see
come
at
the
first
word
yes
when
and
it
s
very
strange
that
when
you
ve
the
care
of
em
you
ve
no
better
control
over
em
than
that
there
they
upstairs
with
their
nasty
snowy
feet
do
go
after
em
and
see
them
made
decent
for
heaven
s
sake
that
gentleman
s
mother
was
then
staying
in
the
house
and
as
i
ascended
the
stairs
and
passed
the
door
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
the
old
lady
declaiming
aloud
to
her
to
this
effect
for
i
could
only
distinguish
the
most
emphatic
words
gracious
heavens
in
all
my
their
death
as
sure
do
you
think
my
dear
she
s
a
take
my
word
for
i
heard
no
more
but
that
sufficed
the
senior
bloomfield
had
been
very
attentive
and
civil
to
me
and
till
now
i
had
thought
her
a
nice
chatty
old
body
she
would
often
come
to
me
and
talk
in
a
confidential
strain
nodding
and
shaking
her
head
and
gesticulating
with
hands
and
eyes
as
a
certain
class
of
old
ladies
are
won
t
to
do
though
i
never
knew
one
that
carried
the
peculiarity
to
so
great
an
extent
she
would
even
sympathise
with
me
for
the
trouble
i
had
with
the
children
and
express
at
times
by
half
sentences
interspersed
with
nods
and
knowing
winks
her
sense
of
the
injudicious
conduct
of
their
mamma
in
so
restricting
my
power
and
neglecting
to
support
me
with
her
authority
such
a
mode
of
testifying
disapprobation
was
not
much
to
my
taste
and
i
generally
refused
to
take
it
in
or
understand
anything
more
than
was
openly
spoken
at
least
i
never
went
farther
than
an
implied
acknowledgment
that
if
matters
were
otherwise
ordered
my
task
would
be
a
less
difficult
one
and
i
should
be
better
able
to
guide
and
instruct
my
charge
but
now
i
must
be
doubly
cautious
hitherto
though
i
saw
the
old
lady
had
her
defects
of
which
one
was
a
proneness
to
proclaim
her
perfections
i
had
always
been
wishful
to
excuse
them
and
to
give
her
credit
for
all
the
virtues
she
professed
and
even
imagine
others
yet
untold
kindness
which
had
been
the
food
of
my
life
through
so
many
years
had
lately
been
so
entirely
denied
me
that
i
welcomed
with
grateful
joy
the
slightest
semblance
of
it
no
wonder
then
that
my
heart
warmed
to
the
old
lady
and
always
gladdened
at
her
approach
and
regretted
her
departure
but
now
the
few
words
luckily
or
unluckily
heard
in
passing
had
wholly
revolutionized
my
ideas
respecting
her
now
i
looked
upon
her
as
hypocritical
and
insincere
a
flatterer
and
a
spy
upon
my
words
and
deeds
doubtless
it
would
have
been
my
interest
still
to
meet
her
with
the
same
cheerful
smile
and
tone
of
respectful
cordiality
as
before
but
i
could
not
if
i
would
my
manner
altered
with
my
feelings
and
became
so
cold
and
shy
that
she
could
not
fail
to
notice
it
she
soon
did
notice
it
and
manner
altered
too
the
familiar
nod
was
changed
to
a
stiff
bow
the
gracious
smile
gave
place
to
a
glare
of
gorgon
ferocity
her
vivacious
loquacity
was
entirely
transferred
from
me
to
the
darling
boy
and
girls
whom
she
flattered
and
indulged
more
absurdly
than
ever
their
mother
had
done
i
confess
i
was
somewhat
troubled
at
this
change
i
feared
the
consequences
of
her
displeasure
and
even
made
some
efforts
to
recover
the
ground
i
had
with
better
apparent
success
than
i
could
have
anticipated
at
one
time
i
merely
in
common
civility
asked
after
her
cough
immediately
her
long
visage
relaxed
into
a
smile
and
she
favoured
me
with
a
particular
history
of
that
and
her
other
infirmities
followed
by
an
account
of
her
pious
resignation
delivered
in
the
usual
emphatic
declamatory
style
which
no
writing
can
portray
but
there
s
one
remedy
for
all
my
dear
and
that
s
resignation
a
toss
of
the
head
resignation
to
the
will
of
heaven
an
uplifting
of
the
hands
and
eyes
it
has
always
supported
me
through
all
my
trials
and
always
will
do
a
succession
of
nods
but
then
it
isn
t
everybody
that
can
say
that
a
shake
of
the
head
but
i
m
one
of
the
pious
ones
miss
grey
a
very
significant
nod
and
toss
and
thank
heaven
i
always
was
another
nod
and
i
glory
in
it
an
emphatic
clasping
of
the
hands
and
shaking
of
the
head
and
with
several
texts
of
scripture
misquoted
or
misapplied
and
religious
exclamations
so
redolent
of
the
ludicrous
in
the
style
of
delivery
and
manner
of
bringing
in
if
not
in
the
expressions
themselves
that
i
decline
repeating
them
she
withdrew
tossing
her
large
head
in
high
herself
at
left
me
hoping
that
after
all
she
was
rather
weak
than
wicked
at
her
next
visit
to
wellwood
house
i
went
so
far
as
to
say
i
was
glad
to
see
her
looking
so
well
the
effect
of
this
was
magical
the
words
intended
as
a
mark
of
civility
were
received
as
a
flattering
compliment
her
countenance
brightened
up
and
from
that
moment
she
became
as
gracious
and
benign
as
heart
could
outward
semblance
at
least
from
what
i
now
saw
of
her
and
what
i
heard
from
the
children
i
know
that
in
order
to
gain
her
cordial
friendship
i
had
but
to
utter
a
word
of
flattery
at
each
convenient
opportunity
but
this
was
against
my
principles
and
for
lack
of
this
the
capricious
old
dame
soon
deprived
me
of
her
favour
again
and
i
believe
did
me
much
secret
injury
she
could
not
greatly
influence
her
against
me
because
between
that
lady
and
herself
there
was
a
mutual
shown
by
her
in
secret
detractions
and
calumniations
by
the
other
in
an
excess
of
frigid
formality
in
her
demeanour
and
no
fawning
flattery
of
the
elder
could
thaw
away
the
wall
of
ice
which
the
younger
interposed
between
them
but
with
her
son
the
old
lady
had
better
success
he
would
listen
to
all
she
had
to
say
provided
she
could
soothe
his
fretful
temper
and
refrain
from
irritating
him
by
her
own
asperities
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
she
considerably
strengthened
his
prejudice
against
me
she
would
tell
him
that
i
shamefully
neglected
the
children
and
even
his
wife
did
not
attend
to
them
as
she
ought
and
that
he
must
look
after
them
himself
or
they
would
all
go
to
ruin
thus
urged
he
would
frequently
give
himself
the
trouble
of
watching
them
from
the
windows
during
their
play
at
times
he
would
follow
them
through
the
grounds
and
too
often
came
suddenly
upon
them
while
they
were
dabbling
in
the
forbidden
well
talking
to
the
coachman
in
the
stables
or
revelling
in
the
filth
of
the
i
meanwhile
wearily
standing
by
having
previously
exhausted
my
energy
in
vain
attempts
to
get
them
away
often
too
he
would
unexpectedly
pop
his
head
into
the
schoolroom
while
the
young
people
were
at
meals
and
find
them
spilling
their
milk
over
the
table
and
themselves
plunging
their
fingers
into
their
own
or
each
other
s
mugs
or
quarrelling
over
their
victuals
like
a
set
of
tiger
s
cubs
if
i
were
quiet
at
the
moment
i
was
conniving
at
their
disorderly
conduct
if
as
was
frequently
the
case
i
happened
to
be
exalting
my
voice
to
enforce
order
i
was
using
undue
violence
and
setting
the
girls
a
bad
example
by
such
ungentleness
of
tone
and
language
i
remember
one
afternoon
in
spring
when
owing
to
the
rain
they
could
not
go
out
but
by
some
amazing
good
fortune
they
had
all
finished
their
lessons
and
yet
abstained
from
running
down
to
tease
their
trick
that
annoyed
me
greatly
but
which
on
rainy
days
i
seldom
could
prevent
their
doing
because
below
they
found
novelty
and
when
visitors
were
in
the
house
and
their
mother
though
she
bid
me
keep
them
in
the
schoolroom
would
never
chide
them
for
leaving
it
or
trouble
herself
to
send
them
back
but
this
day
they
appeared
satisfied
with
their
present
abode
and
what
is
more
wonderful
still
seemed
disposed
to
play
together
without
depending
on
me
for
amusement
and
without
quarrelling
with
each
other
their
occupation
was
a
somewhat
puzzling
one
they
were
all
squatted
together
on
the
floor
by
the
window
over
a
heap
of
broken
toys
and
a
quantity
of
birds
rather
for
the
contents
had
luckily
been
abstracted
these
shells
they
had
broken
up
and
were
pounding
into
small
fragments
to
what
end
i
could
not
imagine
but
so
long
as
they
were
quiet
and
not
in
positive
mischief
i
did
not
care
and
with
a
feeling
of
unusual
repose
i
sat
by
the
fire
putting
the
finishing
stitches
to
a
frock
for
mary
ann
s
doll
intending
when
that
was
done
to
begin
a
letter
to
my
mother
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
the
dingy
head
of
bloomfield
looked
in
all
very
quiet
here
what
are
you
doing
said
he
no
harm
at
least
thought
i
but
he
was
of
a
different
opinion
advancing
to
the
window
and
seeing
the
children
s
occupations
he
testily
what
in
the
world
are
you
about
we
re
grinding
papa
cried
tom
how
you
make
such
a
mess
you
little
devils
don
t
you
see
what
confounded
work
you
re
making
of
the
carpet
the
carpet
was
a
plain
brown
drugget
miss
grey
did
you
know
what
they
were
doing
yes
you
knew
it
you
knew
it
and
you
actually
sat
there
and
permitted
them
to
go
on
without
a
word
of
reproof
i
didn
t
think
they
were
doing
any
any
harm
why
look
there
just
look
at
that
carpet
and
there
ever
anything
like
it
in
a
christian
house
before
no
wonder
your
room
is
not
fit
for
a
wonder
your
pupils
are
worse
than
a
litter
of
pigs
i
declare
it
puts
me
quite
past
my
patience
and
he
departed
shutting
the
door
after
him
with
a
bang
that
made
the
children
laugh
it
puts
me
quite
past
my
patience
too
muttered
i
getting
up
and
seizing
the
poker
i
dashed
it
repeatedly
into
the
cinders
and
stirred
them
up
with
unwonted
energy
thus
easing
my
irritation
under
pretence
of
mending
the
fire
after
this
bloomfield
was
continually
looking
in
to
see
if
the
schoolroom
was
in
order
and
as
the
children
were
continually
littering
the
floor
with
fragments
of
toys
sticks
stones
stubble
leaves
and
other
rubbish
which
i
could
not
prevent
their
bringing
or
oblige
them
to
gather
up
and
which
the
servants
refused
to
clean
after
them
i
had
to
spend
a
considerable
portion
of
my
valuable
leisure
moments
on
my
knees
upon
the
floor
in
painsfully
reducing
things
to
order
once
i
told
them
that
they
should
not
taste
their
supper
till
they
had
picked
up
everything
from
the
carpet
fanny
might
have
hers
when
she
had
taken
up
a
certain
quantity
mary
ann
when
she
had
gathered
twice
as
many
and
tom
was
to
clear
away
the
rest
wonderful
to
state
the
girls
did
their
part
but
tom
was
in
such
a
fury
that
he
flew
upon
the
table
scattered
the
bread
and
milk
about
the
floor
struck
his
sisters
kicked
the
coals
out
of
the
attempted
to
overthrow
the
table
and
chairs
and
seemed
inclined
to
make
a
of
the
whole
contents
of
the
room
but
i
seized
upon
him
and
sending
mary
ann
to
call
her
mamma
held
him
in
spite
of
kicks
blows
yells
and
execrations
till
bloomfield
made
her
appearance
what
is
the
matter
with
my
boy
said
she
and
when
the
matter
was
explained
to
her
all
she
did
was
to
send
for
the
to
put
the
room
in
order
and
bring
master
bloomfield
his
supper
there
now
cried
tom
triumphantly
looking
up
from
his
viands
with
his
mouth
almost
too
full
for
speech
there
now
miss
grey
you
see
i
ve
got
my
supper
in
spite
of
you
and
i
haven
t
picked
up
a
single
thing
the
only
person
in
the
house
who
had
any
real
sympathy
for
me
was
the
nurse
for
she
had
suffered
like
afflictions
though
in
a
smaller
degree
as
she
had
not
the
task
of
teaching
nor
was
she
so
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
her
charge
oh
miss
grey
she
would
say
you
have
some
trouble
with
them
childer
i
have
indeed
betty
and
i
daresay
you
know
what
it
ay
i
do
so
but
i
don
t
vex
myself
o
er
em
as
you
do
and
then
you
see
i
hit
em
a
slap
sometimes
and
them
little
gives
em
a
good
whipping
now
and
then
there
s
nothing
else
will
do
for
em
as
what
they
say
howsoever
i
ve
lost
my
place
for
have
you
betty
i
heard
you
were
going
to
eh
bless
you
yes
missis
gave
me
warning
a
three
wik
sin
she
told
me
afore
christmas
how
it
mud
be
if
i
hit
em
again
but
i
couldn
t
hold
my
hand
off
em
at
nothing
i
know
not
how
do
for
miss
mary
ann
s
worse
by
the
half
nor
her
sisters
chapter
uncle
besides
the
old
lady
there
was
another
relative
of
the
family
whose
visits
were
a
great
annoyance
to
was
uncle
robson
bloomfield
s
brother
a
tall
fellow
with
dark
hair
and
sallow
complexion
like
his
sister
a
nose
that
seemed
to
disdain
the
earth
and
little
grey
eyes
frequently
with
a
mixture
of
real
stupidity
and
affected
contempt
of
all
surrounding
objects
he
was
a
man
but
he
had
found
some
means
of
compressing
his
waist
into
a
remarkably
small
compass
and
that
together
with
the
unnatural
stillness
of
his
form
showed
that
the
manly
robson
the
scorner
of
the
female
sex
was
not
above
the
foppery
of
stays
he
seldom
deigned
to
notice
me
and
when
he
did
it
was
with
a
certain
supercilious
insolence
of
tone
and
manner
that
convinced
me
he
was
no
gentleman
though
it
was
intended
to
have
a
contrary
effect
but
it
was
not
for
that
i
disliked
his
coming
so
much
as
for
the
harm
he
did
the
all
their
evil
propensities
and
undoing
in
a
few
minutes
the
little
good
it
had
taken
me
months
of
labour
to
achieve
fanny
and
little
harriet
he
seldom
condescended
to
notice
but
mary
ann
was
something
of
a
favourite
he
was
continually
encouraging
her
tendency
to
affectation
which
i
had
done
my
utmost
to
crush
talking
about
her
pretty
face
and
filling
her
head
with
all
manner
of
conceited
notions
concerning
her
personal
appearance
which
i
had
instructed
her
to
regard
as
dust
in
the
balance
compared
with
the
cultivation
of
her
mind
and
manners
and
i
never
saw
a
child
so
susceptible
of
flattery
as
she
was
whatever
was
wrong
in
either
her
or
her
brother
he
would
encourage
by
laughing
at
if
not
by
actually
praising
people
little
know
the
injury
they
do
to
children
by
laughing
at
their
faults
and
making
a
pleasant
jest
of
what
their
true
friends
have
endeavoured
to
teach
them
to
hold
in
grave
abhorrence
though
not
a
positive
drunkard
robson
habitually
swallowed
great
quantities
of
wine
and
took
with
relish
an
occasional
glass
of
brandy
and
water
he
taught
his
nephew
to
imitate
him
in
this
to
the
utmost
of
his
ability
and
to
believe
that
the
more
wine
and
spirits
he
could
take
and
the
better
he
liked
them
the
more
he
manifested
his
bold
and
manly
spirit
and
rose
superior
to
his
sisters
bloomfield
had
not
much
to
say
against
it
for
his
favourite
beverage
was
gin
and
water
of
which
he
took
a
considerable
portion
every
day
by
dint
of
constant
to
that
i
chiefly
attributed
his
dingy
complexion
and
waspish
temper
robson
likewise
encouraged
tom
s
propensity
to
persecute
the
lower
creation
both
by
precept
and
example
as
he
frequently
came
to
course
or
shoot
over
his
s
grounds
he
would
bring
his
favourite
dogs
with
him
and
he
treated
them
so
brutally
that
poor
as
i
was
i
would
have
given
a
sovereign
any
day
to
see
one
of
them
bite
him
provided
the
animal
could
have
done
it
with
impunity
sometimes
when
in
a
very
complacent
mood
he
would
go
with
the
children
a
thing
that
irritated
and
annoyed
me
exceedingly
as
by
frequent
and
persevering
attempts
i
flattered
myself
i
had
partly
shown
them
the
evil
of
this
pastime
and
hoped
in
time
to
bring
them
to
some
general
sense
of
justice
and
humanity
but
ten
minutes
birds
with
uncle
robson
or
even
a
laugh
from
him
at
some
relation
of
their
former
barbarities
was
sufficient
at
once
to
destroy
the
effect
of
my
whole
elaborate
course
of
reasoning
and
persuasion
happily
however
during
that
spring
they
never
but
once
got
anything
but
empty
nests
or
too
impatient
to
leave
them
till
the
birds
were
hatched
that
once
tom
who
had
been
with
his
uncle
into
the
neighbouring
plantation
came
running
in
high
glee
into
the
garden
with
a
brood
of
little
callow
nestlings
in
his
hands
mary
ann
and
fanny
whom
i
was
just
bringing
out
ran
to
admire
his
spoils
and
to
beg
each
a
bird
for
themselves
no
not
one
cried
tom
they
re
all
mine
uncle
robson
gave
them
to
two
three
four
shan
t
touch
one
of
them
no
not
one
for
your
lives
continued
he
exultingly
laying
the
nest
on
the
ground
and
standing
over
it
with
his
legs
wide
apart
his
hands
thrust
into
his
his
body
bent
forward
and
his
face
twisted
into
all
manner
of
contortions
in
the
ecstasy
of
his
delight
but
you
shall
see
me
fettle
em
off
my
word
but
i
wallop
em
see
if
i
don
t
now
by
gum
but
there
s
rare
sport
for
me
in
that
but
tom
said
i
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
torture
those
birds
they
must
either
be
killed
at
once
or
carried
back
to
the
place
you
took
them
from
that
the
old
birds
may
continue
to
feed
but
you
don
t
know
where
that
is
madam
it
s
only
me
and
uncle
robson
that
knows
but
if
you
don
t
tell
me
i
shall
kill
them
as
i
hate
you
daren
t
you
daren
t
touch
them
for
your
life
because
you
know
papa
and
mamma
and
uncle
robson
would
be
angry
ha
ha
i
ve
caught
you
there
miss
i
shall
do
what
i
think
right
in
a
case
of
this
sort
without
consulting
any
one
if
your
papa
and
mamma
don
t
happen
to
approve
of
it
i
shall
be
sorry
to
offend
them
but
your
uncle
robson
s
opinions
of
course
are
nothing
to
so
by
a
sense
of
the
risk
of
both
making
myself
sick
and
incurring
the
wrath
of
my
got
a
large
flat
stone
that
had
been
reared
up
for
a
by
the
gardener
then
having
once
more
vainly
endeavoured
to
persuade
the
little
tyrant
to
let
the
birds
be
carried
back
i
asked
what
he
intended
to
do
with
them
with
fiendish
glee
he
commenced
a
list
of
torments
and
while
he
was
busied
in
the
relation
i
dropped
the
stone
upon
his
intended
victims
and
crushed
them
flat
beneath
it
loud
were
the
outcries
terrible
the
execrations
consequent
upon
this
daring
outrage
uncle
robson
had
been
coming
up
the
walk
with
his
gun
and
was
just
then
pausing
to
kick
his
dog
tom
flew
towards
him
vowing
he
would
make
him
kick
me
instead
of
juno
robson
leant
upon
his
gun
and
laughed
excessively
at
the
violence
of
his
nephew
s
passion
and
the
bitter
maledictions
and
opprobrious
epithets
he
heaped
upon
me
well
you
a
good
un
exclaimed
he
at
length
taking
up
his
weapon
and
proceeding
towards
the
house
damme
but
the
lad
has
some
spunk
in
him
too
curse
me
if
ever
i
saw
a
nobler
little
scoundrel
than
that
he
s
beyond
petticoat
government
already
by
god
he
defies
mother
granny
governess
and
all
ha
ha
ha
never
mind
tom
i
ll
get
you
another
brood
if
you
do
robson
i
shall
kill
them
too
said
i
humph
replied
he
and
having
honoured
me
with
a
broad
contrary
to
his
expectations
i
sustained
without
turned
away
with
an
air
of
supreme
contempt
and
stalked
into
the
house
tom
next
went
to
tell
his
mamma
it
was
not
her
way
to
say
much
on
any
subject
but
when
she
next
saw
me
her
aspect
and
demeanour
were
doubly
dark
and
chilled
after
some
casual
remark
about
the
weather
she
i
am
sorry
miss
grey
you
should
think
it
necessary
to
interfere
with
master
bloomfield
s
amusements
he
was
very
much
distressed
about
your
destroying
the
when
master
bloomfield
s
amusements
consist
in
injuring
sentient
creatures
i
answered
i
think
it
my
duty
to
you
seemed
to
have
forgotten
said
she
calmly
that
the
creatures
were
all
created
for
our
i
thought
that
doctrine
admitted
some
doubt
but
merely
if
they
were
we
have
no
right
to
torment
them
for
our
i
think
said
she
a
child
s
amusement
is
scarcely
to
be
weighed
against
the
welfare
of
a
soulless
but
for
the
child
s
own
sake
it
ought
not
to
be
encouraged
to
have
such
amusements
answered
i
as
meekly
as
i
could
to
make
up
for
such
unusual
pertinacity
blessed
are
the
merciful
for
they
shall
obtain
oh
of
course
but
that
refers
to
our
conduct
towards
each
the
merciful
man
shows
mercy
to
his
beast
i
ventured
to
add
i
think
have
not
shown
much
mercy
replied
she
with
a
short
bitter
laugh
killing
the
poor
birds
by
wholesale
in
that
shocking
manner
and
putting
the
dear
boy
to
such
misery
for
a
mere
i
judged
it
prudent
to
say
no
more
this
was
the
nearest
approach
to
a
quarrel
i
ever
had
with
bloomfield
as
well
as
the
greatest
number
of
words
i
ever
exchanged
with
her
at
one
time
since
the
day
of
my
first
arrival
but
robson
and
old
bloomfield
were
not
the
only
guests
whose
coming
to
wellwood
house
annoyed
me
every
visitor
disturbed
me
more
or
less
not
so
much
because
they
neglected
me
though
i
did
feel
their
conduct
strange
and
disagreeable
in
that
respect
as
because
i
found
it
impossible
to
keep
my
pupils
away
from
them
as
i
was
repeatedly
desired
to
do
tom
must
talk
to
them
and
mary
ann
must
be
noticed
by
them
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
knew
what
it
was
to
feel
any
degree
of
shamefacedness
or
even
common
modesty
they
would
indecently
and
clamorously
interrupt
the
conversation
of
their
elders
tease
them
with
the
most
impertinent
questions
roughly
collar
the
gentlemen
climb
their
knees
uninvited
hang
about
their
shoulders
or
rifle
their
pockets
pull
the
ladies
gowns
disorder
their
hair
tumble
their
collars
and
importunately
beg
for
their
trinkets
bloomfield
had
the
sense
to
be
shocked
and
annoyed
at
all
this
but
she
had
not
sense
to
prevent
it
she
expected
me
to
prevent
it
but
how
could
the
guests
with
their
fine
clothes
and
new
faces
continually
flattered
and
indulged
them
out
of
complaisance
to
their
could
i
with
my
homely
garments
face
and
honest
words
draw
them
away
i
strained
every
nerve
to
do
so
by
striving
to
amuse
them
i
endeavoured
to
attract
them
to
my
side
by
the
exertion
of
such
authority
as
i
possessed
and
by
such
severity
as
i
dared
to
use
i
tried
to
deter
them
from
tormenting
the
guests
and
by
reproaching
their
unmannerly
conduct
to
make
them
ashamed
to
repeat
it
but
they
knew
no
shame
they
scorned
authority
which
had
no
terrors
to
back
it
and
as
for
kindness
and
affection
either
they
had
no
hearts
or
such
as
they
had
were
so
strongly
guarded
and
so
well
concealed
that
i
with
all
my
efforts
had
not
yet
discovered
how
to
reach
them
but
soon
my
trials
in
this
quarter
came
to
a
than
i
either
expected
or
desired
for
one
sweet
evening
towards
the
close
of
may
as
i
was
rejoicing
in
the
near
approach
of
the
holidays
and
congratulating
myself
upon
having
made
some
progress
with
my
pupils
as
far
as
their
learning
went
at
least
for
i
instilled
into
their
heads
and
i
had
at
length
brought
them
to
be
a
very
rational
about
getting
their
lessons
done
in
time
to
leave
some
space
for
recreation
instead
of
tormenting
themselves
and
me
all
day
long
to
no
purpose
bloomfield
sent
for
me
and
calmly
told
me
that
after
midsummer
my
services
would
be
no
longer
required
she
assured
me
that
my
character
and
general
conduct
were
unexceptionable
but
the
children
had
made
so
little
improvement
since
my
arrival
that
bloomfield
and
she
felt
it
their
duty
to
seek
some
other
mode
of
instruction
though
superior
to
most
children
of
their
years
in
abilities
they
were
decidedly
behind
them
in
attainments
their
manners
were
uncultivated
and
their
tempers
unruly
and
this
she
attributed
to
a
want
of
sufficient
firmness
and
diligent
persevering
care
on
my
part
unshaken
firmness
devoted
diligence
unwearied
perseverance
unceasing
care
were
the
very
qualifications
on
which
i
had
secretly
prided
myself
and
by
which
i
had
hoped
in
time
to
overcome
all
difficulties
and
obtain
success
at
last
i
wished
to
say
something
in
my
own
justification
but
in
attempting
to
speak
i
felt
my
voice
falter
and
rather
than
testify
any
emotion
or
suffer
the
tears
to
overflow
that
were
already
gathering
in
my
eyes
i
chose
to
keep
silence
and
bear
all
like
a
culprit
thus
was
i
dismissed
and
thus
i
sought
my
home
alas
what
would
they
think
of
me
unable
after
all
my
boasting
to
keep
my
place
even
for
a
single
year
as
governess
to
three
small
children
whose
mother
was
asserted
by
my
own
aunt
to
be
a
very
nice
having
been
thus
weighed
in
the
balance
and
found
wanting
i
need
not
hope
they
would
be
willing
to
try
me
again
and
this
was
an
unwelcome
thought
for
vexed
harassed
disappointed
as
i
had
been
and
greatly
as
i
had
learned
to
love
and
value
my
home
i
was
not
yet
weary
of
adventure
nor
willing
to
relax
my
efforts
i
knew
that
all
parents
were
not
like
and
bloomfield
and
i
was
certain
all
children
were
not
like
theirs
the
next
family
must
be
different
and
any
change
must
be
for
the
better
i
had
been
seasoned
by
adversity
and
tutored
by
experience
and
i
longed
to
redeem
my
lost
honour
in
the
eyes
of
those
whose
opinion
was
more
than
that
of
all
the
world
to
me
chapter
parsonage
again
for
a
few
months
i
remained
peaceably
at
home
in
the
quiet
enjoyment
of
liberty
and
rest
and
genuine
friendship
from
all
of
which
i
had
fasted
so
long
and
in
the
earnest
prosecution
of
my
studies
to
recover
what
i
had
lost
during
my
stay
at
wellwood
house
and
to
lay
in
new
stores
for
future
use
my
father
s
health
was
still
very
infirm
but
not
materially
worse
than
when
i
last
saw
him
and
i
was
glad
i
had
it
in
my
power
to
cheer
him
by
my
return
and
to
amuse
him
with
singing
his
favourite
songs
no
one
triumphed
over
my
failure
or
said
i
had
better
have
taken
his
or
her
advice
and
quietly
stayed
at
home
all
were
glad
to
have
me
back
again
and
lavished
more
kindness
than
ever
upon
me
to
make
up
for
the
sufferings
i
had
undergone
but
not
one
would
touch
a
shilling
of
what
i
had
so
cheerfully
earned
and
so
carefully
saved
in
the
hope
of
sharing
it
with
them
by
dint
of
pinching
here
and
scraping
there
our
debts
were
already
nearly
paid
mary
had
had
good
success
with
her
drawings
but
our
father
had
insisted
upon
likewise
keeping
all
the
produce
of
her
industry
to
herself
all
we
could
spare
from
the
supply
of
our
humble
wardrobe
and
our
little
casual
expenses
he
directed
us
to
put
into
the
savings
saying
we
knew
not
how
soon
we
might
be
dependent
on
that
alone
for
support
for
he
felt
he
had
not
long
to
be
with
us
and
what
would
become
of
our
mother
and
us
when
he
was
gone
god
only
knew
dear
papa
if
he
had
troubled
himself
less
about
the
afflictions
that
threatened
us
in
case
of
his
death
i
am
convinced
that
dreaded
event
would
not
have
taken
place
so
soon
my
mother
would
never
suffer
him
to
ponder
on
the
subject
if
she
could
help
it
oh
richard
exclaimed
she
on
one
occasion
if
you
would
but
dismiss
such
gloomy
subjects
from
your
mind
you
would
live
as
long
as
any
of
us
at
least
you
would
live
to
see
the
girls
married
and
yourself
a
happy
grandfather
with
a
canty
old
dame
for
your
my
mother
laughed
and
so
did
my
father
but
his
laugh
soon
perished
in
a
dreary
sigh
penniless
things
said
he
who
will
take
them
i
wonder
why
nobody
shall
that
isn
t
thankful
for
them
wasn
t
i
penniless
when
you
took
me
and
you
at
least
to
be
vastly
pleased
with
your
acquisition
but
it
s
no
matter
whether
they
get
married
or
not
we
can
devise
a
thousand
honest
ways
of
making
a
livelihood
and
i
wonder
richard
you
can
think
of
bothering
your
head
about
our
in
case
of
your
death
as
if
would
be
anything
compared
with
the
calamity
of
losing
affliction
that
you
well
know
would
swallow
up
all
others
and
which
you
ought
to
do
your
utmost
to
preserve
us
from
and
there
is
nothing
like
a
cheerful
mind
for
keeping
the
body
in
i
know
alice
it
is
wrong
to
keep
repining
as
i
do
but
i
can
not
help
it
you
must
bear
with
i
bear
with
you
if
i
can
alter
you
replied
my
mother
but
the
harshness
of
her
words
was
undone
by
the
earnest
affection
of
her
tone
and
pleasant
smile
that
made
my
father
smile
again
less
sadly
and
less
transiently
than
was
his
wont
mamma
said
i
as
soon
as
i
could
find
an
opportunity
of
speaking
with
her
alone
my
money
is
but
little
and
can
not
last
long
if
i
could
increase
it
it
would
lessen
papa
s
anxiety
on
one
subject
at
least
i
can
not
draw
like
mary
and
so
the
best
thing
i
could
do
would
be
to
look
out
for
another
and
so
you
would
actually
try
again
agnes
decidedly
i
why
my
dear
i
should
have
thought
you
had
had
enough
of
i
know
said
i
everybody
is
not
like
and
some
are
worse
interrupted
my
mother
but
not
many
i
think
replied
i
and
i
m
sure
all
children
are
not
like
theirs
for
i
and
mary
were
not
we
always
did
as
you
bid
us
didn
t
we
generally
but
then
i
did
not
spoil
you
and
you
were
not
perfect
angels
after
all
mary
had
a
fund
of
quiet
obstinacy
and
you
were
somewhat
faulty
in
regard
to
temper
but
you
were
very
good
children
on
the
i
know
i
was
sulky
sometimes
and
i
should
have
been
glad
to
see
these
children
sulky
sometimes
too
for
then
i
could
have
understood
them
but
they
never
were
for
they
not
be
offended
nor
hurt
nor
ashamed
they
could
not
be
unhappy
in
any
way
except
when
they
were
in
a
well
if
they
not
it
was
not
their
fault
you
can
not
expect
stone
to
be
as
pliable
as
no
but
still
it
is
very
unpleasant
to
live
with
such
unimpressible
incomprehensible
creatures
you
can
not
love
them
and
if
you
could
your
love
would
be
utterly
thrown
away
they
could
neither
return
it
nor
value
nor
understand
it
but
however
even
if
i
should
stumble
on
such
a
family
again
which
is
quite
unlikely
i
have
all
this
experience
to
begin
with
and
i
should
manage
better
another
time
and
the
end
and
aim
of
this
preamble
is
let
me
try
well
my
girl
you
are
not
easily
discouraged
i
see
i
am
glad
of
that
but
let
me
tell
you
you
are
a
good
deal
paler
and
thinner
than
when
you
first
left
home
and
we
can
not
have
you
undermining
your
health
to
hoard
up
money
either
for
yourself
or
mary
tells
me
i
am
changed
too
and
i
don
t
much
wonder
at
it
for
i
was
in
a
constant
state
of
agitation
and
anxiety
all
day
long
but
next
time
i
am
determined
to
take
things
after
some
further
discussion
my
mother
promised
once
more
to
assist
me
provided
i
would
wait
and
be
patient
and
i
left
her
to
broach
the
matter
to
my
father
when
and
how
she
deemed
it
most
advisable
never
doubting
her
ability
to
obtain
his
consent
meantime
i
searched
with
great
interest
the
advertising
columns
of
the
newspapers
and
wrote
answers
to
every
wanted
a
governess
that
appeared
at
all
eligible
but
all
my
letters
as
well
as
the
replies
when
i
got
any
were
dutifully
shown
to
my
mother
and
she
to
my
chagrin
made
me
reject
the
situations
one
after
another
these
were
low
people
these
were
too
exacting
in
their
demands
and
these
too
niggardly
in
their
remuneration
your
talents
are
not
such
as
every
poor
clergyman
s
daughter
possesses
agnes
she
would
say
and
you
must
not
throw
them
away
remember
you
promised
to
be
patient
there
is
no
need
of
hurry
you
have
plenty
of
time
before
you
and
may
have
many
chances
at
length
she
advised
me
to
put
an
advertisement
myself
in
the
paper
stating
my
qualifications
music
singing
drawing
french
latin
and
german
said
she
are
no
mean
assemblage
many
will
be
glad
to
have
so
much
in
one
instructor
and
this
time
you
shall
try
your
fortune
in
a
somewhat
higher
family
in
that
of
some
genuine
thoroughbred
gentleman
for
such
are
far
more
likely
to
treat
you
with
proper
respect
and
consideration
than
those
tradespeople
and
arrogant
upstarts
i
have
known
several
among
the
higher
ranks
who
treated
their
governesses
quite
as
one
of
the
family
though
some
i
allow
are
as
insolent
and
exacting
as
any
one
else
can
be
for
there
are
bad
and
good
in
all
the
advertisement
was
quickly
written
and
despatched
of
the
two
parties
who
answered
it
but
one
would
consent
to
give
me
fifty
pounds
the
sum
my
mother
bade
me
name
as
the
salary
i
should
require
and
here
i
hesitated
about
engaging
myself
as
i
feared
the
children
would
be
too
old
and
their
parents
would
require
some
one
more
showy
or
more
experienced
if
not
more
accomplished
than
i
but
my
mother
dissuaded
me
from
declining
it
on
that
account
i
should
do
vastly
well
she
said
if
i
would
only
throw
aside
my
diffidence
and
acquire
a
little
more
confidence
in
myself
i
was
just
to
give
a
plain
true
statement
of
my
acquirements
and
qualifications
and
name
what
stipulations
i
chose
to
make
and
then
await
the
result
the
only
stipulation
i
ventured
to
propose
was
that
i
might
be
allowed
two
months
holidays
during
the
year
to
visit
my
friends
at
midsummer
and
christmas
the
unknown
lady
in
her
reply
made
no
objection
to
this
and
stated
that
as
to
my
acquirements
she
had
no
doubt
i
should
be
able
to
give
satisfaction
but
in
the
engagement
of
governesses
she
considered
those
things
as
but
subordinate
points
as
being
situated
in
the
neighbourhood
of
o
she
could
get
masters
to
supply
any
deficiencies
in
that
respect
but
in
her
opinion
next
to
unimpeachable
morality
a
mild
and
cheerful
temper
and
obliging
disposition
were
the
most
essential
requisities
my
mother
did
not
relish
this
at
all
and
now
made
many
objections
to
my
accepting
the
situation
in
which
my
sister
warmly
supported
her
but
unwilling
to
be
balked
again
i
overruled
them
all
and
having
first
obtained
the
consent
of
my
father
who
had
a
short
time
previously
been
apprised
of
these
transactions
i
wrote
a
most
obliging
epistle
to
my
unknown
correspondent
and
finally
the
bargain
was
concluded
it
was
decreed
that
on
the
last
day
of
january
i
was
to
enter
upon
my
new
office
as
governess
in
the
family
of
murray
of
horton
lodge
near
o
about
seventy
miles
from
our
village
a
formidable
distance
to
me
as
i
had
never
been
above
twenty
miles
from
home
in
all
the
course
of
my
twenty
years
sojourn
on
earth
and
as
moreover
every
individual
in
that
family
and
in
the
neighbourhood
was
utterly
unknown
to
myself
and
all
my
acquaintances
but
this
rendered
it
only
the
more
piquant
to
me
i
had
now
in
some
measure
got
rid
of
the
that
had
formerly
oppressed
me
so
much
there
was
a
pleasing
excitement
in
the
idea
of
entering
these
unknown
regions
and
making
my
way
alone
among
its
strange
inhabitants
i
now
flattered
myself
i
was
going
to
see
something
in
the
world
murray
s
residence
was
near
a
large
town
and
not
in
a
manufacturing
district
where
the
people
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
make
money
his
rank
from
what
i
could
gather
appeared
to
be
higher
than
that
of
bloomfield
and
doubtless
he
was
one
of
those
genuine
thoroughbred
gentry
my
mother
spoke
of
who
would
treat
his
governess
with
due
consideration
as
a
respectable
lady
the
instructor
and
guide
of
his
children
and
not
a
mere
upper
servant
then
my
pupils
being
older
would
be
more
rational
more
teachable
and
less
troublesome
than
the
last
they
would
be
less
confined
to
the
schoolroom
and
not
require
that
constant
labour
and
incessant
watching
and
finally
bright
visions
mingled
with
my
hopes
with
which
the
care
of
children
and
the
mere
duties
of
a
governess
had
little
or
nothing
to
do
thus
the
reader
will
see
that
i
had
no
claim
to
be
regarded
as
a
martyr
to
filial
piety
going
forth
to
sacrifice
peace
and
liberty
for
the
sole
purpose
of
laying
up
stores
for
the
comfort
and
support
of
my
parents
though
certainly
the
comfort
of
my
father
and
the
future
support
of
my
mother
had
a
large
share
in
my
calculations
and
fifty
pounds
appeared
to
me
no
ordinary
sum
i
must
have
decent
clothes
becoming
my
station
i
must
it
seemed
put
out
my
washing
and
also
pay
for
my
four
annual
journeys
between
horton
lodge
and
home
but
with
strict
attention
to
economy
surely
twenty
pounds
or
little
more
would
cover
those
expenses
and
then
there
would
be
thirty
for
the
bank
or
little
less
what
a
valuable
addition
to
our
stock
oh
i
must
struggle
to
keep
this
situation
whatever
it
might
be
both
for
my
own
honour
among
my
friends
and
for
the
solid
services
i
might
render
them
by
my
continuance
there
chapter
lodge
the
of
january
was
a
wild
tempestuous
day
there
was
a
strong
north
wind
with
a
continual
storm
of
snow
drifting
on
the
ground
and
whirling
through
the
air
my
friends
would
have
had
me
delay
my
departure
but
fearful
of
prejudicing
my
employers
against
me
by
such
want
of
punctuality
at
the
commencement
of
my
undertaking
i
persisted
in
keeping
the
appointment
i
will
not
inflict
upon
my
readers
an
account
of
my
leaving
home
on
that
dark
winter
morning
the
fond
farewells
the
long
long
journey
to
o
the
solitary
waitings
in
inns
for
coaches
or
there
were
some
railways
finally
the
meeting
at
o
with
murray
s
servant
who
had
been
sent
with
the
phaeton
to
drive
me
from
thence
to
horton
lodge
i
will
just
state
that
the
heavy
snow
had
thrown
such
impediments
in
the
way
of
both
horses
and
that
it
was
dark
some
hours
before
i
reached
my
journey
s
end
and
that
a
most
bewildering
storm
came
on
at
last
which
made
the
few
miles
space
between
o
and
horton
lodge
a
long
and
formidable
passage
i
sat
resigned
with
the
cold
sharp
snow
drifting
through
my
veil
and
filling
my
lap
seeing
nothing
and
wondering
how
the
unfortunate
horse
and
driver
could
make
their
way
even
as
well
as
they
did
and
indeed
it
was
but
a
toilsome
creeping
style
of
progression
to
say
the
best
of
it
at
length
we
paused
and
at
the
call
of
the
driver
someone
unlatched
and
rolled
back
upon
their
creaking
hinges
what
appeared
to
be
the
park
gates
then
we
proceeded
along
a
smoother
road
whence
occasionally
i
perceived
some
huge
hoary
mass
gleaming
through
the
darkness
which
i
took
to
be
a
portion
of
a
tree
after
a
considerable
time
we
paused
again
before
the
stately
portico
of
a
large
house
with
long
windows
descending
to
the
ground
i
rose
with
some
difficulty
from
under
the
superincumbent
snowdrift
and
alighted
from
the
carriage
expecting
that
a
kind
and
hospitable
reception
would
indemnify
me
for
the
toils
and
hardships
of
the
day
a
gentleman
person
in
black
opened
the
door
and
admitted
me
into
a
spacious
hall
lighted
by
an
lamp
suspended
from
the
ceiling
he
led
me
through
this
along
a
passage
and
opening
the
door
of
a
back
room
told
me
that
was
the
schoolroom
i
entered
and
found
two
young
ladies
and
two
young
future
pupils
i
supposed
after
a
formal
greeting
the
elder
girl
who
was
trifling
over
a
piece
of
canvas
and
a
basket
of
german
wools
asked
if
i
should
like
to
go
upstairs
i
replied
in
the
affirmative
of
course
matilda
take
a
candle
and
show
her
her
room
said
she
miss
matilda
a
strapping
hoyden
of
about
fourteen
with
a
short
frock
and
trousers
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
made
a
slight
grimace
but
took
a
candle
and
proceeded
before
me
up
the
back
stairs
a
long
steep
double
flight
and
through
a
long
narrow
passage
to
a
small
but
tolerably
comfortable
room
she
then
asked
me
if
i
would
take
some
tea
or
coffee
i
was
about
to
answer
no
but
remembering
that
i
had
taken
nothing
since
seven
o
clock
that
morning
and
feeling
faint
in
consequence
i
said
i
would
take
a
cup
of
tea
saying
she
would
tell
brown
the
young
lady
departed
and
by
the
time
i
had
divested
myself
of
my
heavy
wet
cloak
shawl
bonnet
a
mincing
damsel
came
to
say
the
young
ladies
desired
to
know
whether
i
would
take
my
tea
up
there
or
in
the
schoolroom
under
the
plea
of
fatigue
i
chose
to
take
it
there
she
withdrew
and
after
a
while
returned
again
with
a
small
and
placed
it
on
the
chest
of
drawers
which
served
as
a
having
civilly
thanked
her
i
asked
at
what
time
i
should
be
expected
to
rise
in
the
morning
the
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
breakfast
at
eight
ma
am
said
she
they
rise
early
but
as
they
seldom
do
any
lessons
before
breakfast
i
should
think
it
will
do
if
you
rise
soon
after
i
desired
her
to
be
so
kind
as
to
call
me
at
seven
and
promising
to
do
so
she
withdrew
then
having
broken
my
long
fast
on
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
little
thin
bread
and
butter
i
sat
down
beside
the
small
smouldering
fire
and
amused
myself
with
a
hearty
fit
of
crying
after
which
i
said
my
prayers
and
then
feeling
considerably
relieved
began
to
prepare
for
bed
finding
that
none
of
my
luggage
was
brought
up
i
instituted
a
search
for
the
bell
and
failing
to
discover
any
signs
of
such
a
convenience
in
any
corner
of
the
room
i
took
my
candle
and
ventured
through
the
long
passage
and
down
the
steep
stairs
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
meeting
a
female
on
the
way
i
told
her
what
i
wanted
but
not
without
considerable
hesitation
as
i
was
not
quite
sure
whether
it
was
one
of
the
upper
servants
or
murray
herself
it
happened
however
to
be
the
lady
with
the
air
of
one
conferring
an
unusual
favour
she
vouchsafed
to
undertake
the
sending
up
of
my
things
and
when
i
had
my
room
and
waited
and
wondered
a
long
time
greatly
fearing
that
she
had
forgotten
or
neglected
to
perform
her
promise
and
doubting
whether
to
keep
waiting
or
go
to
bed
or
go
down
again
my
hopes
at
length
were
revived
by
the
sound
of
voices
and
laughter
accompanied
by
the
tramp
of
feet
along
the
passage
and
presently
the
luggage
was
brought
in
by
a
maid
and
a
man
neither
of
them
very
respectful
in
their
demeanour
to
me
having
shut
the
door
upon
their
retiring
footsteps
and
unpacked
a
few
of
my
things
i
betook
myself
to
rest
gladly
enough
for
i
was
weary
in
body
and
mind
it
was
with
a
strange
feeling
of
desolation
mingled
with
a
strong
sense
of
the
novelty
of
my
situation
and
a
joyless
kind
of
curiosity
concerning
what
was
yet
unknown
that
i
awoke
the
next
morning
feeling
like
one
whirled
away
by
enchantment
and
suddenly
dropped
from
the
clouds
into
a
remote
and
unknown
land
widely
and
completely
isolated
from
all
he
had
ever
seen
or
known
before
or
like
a
borne
on
the
wind
to
some
strange
nook
of
uncongenial
soil
where
it
must
lie
long
enough
before
it
can
take
root
and
germinate
extracting
nourishment
from
what
appears
so
alien
to
its
nature
if
indeed
it
ever
can
but
this
gives
no
proper
idea
of
my
feelings
at
all
and
no
one
that
has
not
lived
such
a
retired
stationary
life
as
mine
can
possibly
imagine
what
they
were
hardly
even
if
he
has
known
what
it
is
to
awake
some
morning
and
find
himself
in
port
nelson
in
new
zealand
with
a
world
of
waters
between
himself
and
all
that
knew
him
i
shall
not
soon
forget
the
peculiar
feeling
with
which
i
raised
my
blind
and
looked
out
upon
the
unknown
world
a
wide
white
wilderness
was
all
that
met
my
gaze
a
waste
of
deserts
tossed
in
snow
and
heavy
laden
groves
i
descended
to
the
schoolroom
with
no
remarkable
eagerness
to
join
my
pupils
though
not
without
some
feeling
of
curiosity
respecting
what
a
further
acquaintance
would
reveal
one
thing
among
others
of
more
obvious
importance
i
determined
with
must
begin
with
calling
them
miss
and
master
it
seemed
to
me
a
chilling
and
unnatural
piece
of
punctilio
between
the
children
of
a
family
and
their
instructor
and
daily
companion
especially
where
the
former
were
in
their
early
childhood
as
at
wellwood
house
but
even
there
my
calling
the
little
bloomfields
by
their
simple
names
had
been
regarded
as
an
offensive
liberty
as
their
parents
had
taken
care
to
show
me
by
carefully
designating
them
and
bloomfield
in
speaking
to
me
i
had
been
very
slow
to
take
the
hint
because
the
whole
affair
struck
me
as
so
very
absurd
but
now
i
determined
to
be
wiser
and
begin
at
once
with
as
much
form
and
ceremony
as
any
member
of
the
family
would
be
likely
to
require
and
indeed
the
children
being
so
much
older
there
would
be
less
difficulty
though
the
little
words
miss
and
master
seemed
to
have
a
surprising
effect
in
repressing
all
familiar
kindness
and
extinguishing
every
gleam
of
cordiality
that
might
arise
between
us
as
i
can
not
like
dogberry
find
it
in
my
heart
to
bestow
all
my
tediousness
upon
the
reader
i
will
not
go
on
to
bore
him
with
a
minute
detail
of
all
the
discoveries
and
proceedings
of
this
and
the
following
day
no
doubt
he
will
be
amply
satisfied
with
a
slight
sketch
of
the
different
members
of
the
family
and
a
general
view
of
the
first
year
or
two
of
my
sojourn
among
them
to
begin
with
the
head
murray
was
by
all
accounts
a
blustering
roystering
country
squire
a
devoted
a
skilful
and
farrier
an
active
practical
farmer
and
a
hearty
by
all
accounts
i
say
for
except
on
sundays
when
he
went
to
church
i
never
saw
him
from
month
to
month
unless
in
crossing
the
hall
or
walking
in
the
grounds
the
figure
of
a
tall
stout
gentleman
with
scarlet
cheeks
and
crimson
nose
happened
to
come
across
me
on
which
occasions
if
he
passed
near
enough
to
speak
an
unceremonious
nod
accompanied
by
a
morning
miss
grey
or
some
such
brief
salutation
was
usually
vouchsafed
frequently
indeed
his
loud
laugh
reached
me
from
afar
and
oftener
still
i
heard
him
swearing
and
blaspheming
against
the
footmen
groom
coachman
or
some
other
hapless
dependant
murray
was
a
handsome
dashing
lady
of
forty
who
certainly
required
neither
rouge
nor
padding
to
add
to
her
charms
and
whose
chief
enjoyments
were
or
seemed
to
be
in
giving
or
frequenting
parties
and
in
dressing
at
the
very
top
of
the
fashion
i
did
not
see
her
till
eleven
o
clock
on
the
morning
after
my
arrival
when
she
honoured
me
with
a
visit
just
as
my
mother
might
step
into
the
kitchen
to
see
a
new
yet
not
so
either
for
my
mother
would
have
seen
her
immediately
after
her
arrival
and
not
waited
till
the
next
day
and
moreover
she
would
have
addressed
her
in
a
more
kind
and
friendly
manner
and
given
her
some
words
of
comfort
as
well
as
a
plain
exposition
of
her
duties
but
murray
did
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
she
just
stepped
into
the
schoolroom
on
her
return
from
ordering
dinner
in
the
housekeeper
s
room
bade
me
stood
for
two
minutes
by
the
fire
said
a
few
words
about
the
weather
and
the
rather
rough
journey
i
must
have
had
yesterday
petted
her
youngest
boy
of
had
just
been
wiping
his
mouth
and
hands
on
her
gown
after
indulging
in
some
savoury
morsel
from
the
housekeeper
s
store
told
me
what
a
sweet
good
boy
he
was
and
then
sailed
out
with
a
smile
upon
her
face
thinking
no
doubt
that
she
had
done
quite
enough
for
the
present
and
had
been
delightfully
condescending
into
the
bargain
her
children
evidently
held
the
same
opinion
and
i
alone
thought
otherwise
after
this
she
looked
in
upon
me
once
or
twice
during
the
absence
of
my
pupils
to
enlighten
me
concerning
my
duties
towards
them
for
the
girls
she
seemed
anxious
only
to
render
them
as
superficially
attractive
and
showily
accomplished
as
they
could
possibly
be
made
without
present
trouble
or
discomfort
to
themselves
and
i
was
to
act
study
and
strive
to
amuse
and
oblige
instruct
refine
and
polish
with
the
least
possible
exertion
on
their
part
and
no
exercise
of
authority
on
mine
with
regard
to
the
two
boys
it
was
much
the
same
only
instead
of
accomplishments
i
was
to
get
the
greatest
possible
quantity
of
latin
grammar
and
valpy
s
delectus
into
their
heads
in
order
to
fit
them
for
greatest
possible
quantity
at
least
trouble
to
themselves
john
might
be
a
little
and
charles
might
be
a
little
nervous
and
but
at
all
events
miss
grey
said
she
i
hope
will
keep
your
temper
and
be
mild
and
patient
throughout
especially
with
the
dear
little
charles
he
is
so
extremely
nervous
and
susceptible
and
so
utterly
unaccustomed
to
anything
but
the
tenderest
treatment
you
will
excuse
my
naming
these
things
to
you
for
the
fact
is
i
have
hitherto
found
all
the
governesses
even
the
very
best
of
them
faulty
in
this
particular
they
wanted
that
meek
and
quiet
spirit
which
matthew
or
some
of
them
says
is
better
than
the
putting
on
of
will
know
the
passage
to
which
i
allude
for
you
are
a
clergyman
s
daughter
but
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
give
satisfaction
in
this
respect
as
well
as
the
rest
and
remember
on
all
occasions
when
any
of
the
young
people
do
anything
improper
if
persuasion
and
gentle
remonstrance
will
not
do
let
one
of
the
others
come
and
tell
me
for
i
can
speak
to
them
more
plainly
than
it
would
be
proper
for
you
to
do
and
make
them
as
happy
as
you
can
miss
grey
and
i
dare
say
you
will
do
very
i
observed
that
while
murray
was
so
extremely
solicitous
for
the
comfort
and
happiness
of
her
children
and
continually
talking
about
it
she
never
once
mentioned
mine
though
they
were
at
home
surrounded
by
friends
and
i
an
alien
among
strangers
and
i
did
not
yet
know
enough
of
the
world
not
to
be
considerably
surprised
at
this
anomaly
miss
murray
otherwise
rosalie
was
about
sixteen
when
i
came
and
decidedly
a
very
pretty
girl
and
in
two
years
longer
as
time
more
completely
developed
her
form
and
added
grace
to
her
carriage
and
deportment
she
became
positively
beautiful
and
that
in
no
common
degree
she
was
tall
and
slender
yet
not
thin
perfectly
formed
exquisitely
fair
though
not
without
a
brilliant
healthy
bloom
her
hair
which
she
wore
in
a
profusion
of
long
ringlets
was
of
a
very
light
brown
inclining
to
yellow
her
eyes
were
pale
blue
but
so
clear
and
bright
that
few
would
wish
them
darker
the
rest
of
her
features
were
small
not
quite
regular
and
not
remarkably
otherwise
but
altogether
you
could
not
hesitate
to
pronounce
her
a
very
lovely
girl
i
wish
i
could
say
as
much
for
mind
and
disposition
as
i
can
for
her
form
and
face
yet
think
not
i
have
any
dreadful
disclosures
to
make
she
was
lively
and
could
be
very
agreeable
with
those
who
did
not
cross
her
will
towards
me
when
i
first
came
she
was
cold
and
haughty
then
insolent
and
overbearing
but
on
a
further
acquaintance
she
gradually
laid
aside
her
airs
and
in
time
became
as
deeply
attached
to
me
as
it
was
possible
for
to
be
to
one
of
my
character
and
position
for
she
seldom
lost
sight
for
above
half
an
hour
at
a
time
of
the
fact
of
my
being
a
hireling
and
a
poor
curate
s
daughter
and
yet
upon
the
whole
i
believe
she
respected
me
more
than
she
herself
was
aware
of
because
i
was
the
only
person
in
the
house
who
steadily
professed
good
principles
habitually
spoke
the
truth
and
generally
endeavoured
to
make
inclination
bow
to
duty
and
this
i
say
not
of
course
in
commendation
of
myself
but
to
show
the
unfortunate
state
of
the
family
to
which
my
services
were
for
the
present
devoted
there
was
no
member
of
it
in
whom
i
regretted
this
sad
want
of
principle
so
much
as
miss
murray
herself
not
only
because
she
had
taken
a
fancy
to
me
but
because
there
was
so
much
of
what
was
pleasant
and
prepossessing
in
herself
that
in
spite
of
her
failings
i
really
liked
she
did
not
rouse
my
indignation
or
ruffle
my
temper
by
great
a
display
of
her
faults
these
however
i
would
fain
persuade
myself
were
rather
the
effect
of
her
education
than
her
disposition
she
had
never
been
perfectly
taught
the
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
she
had
like
her
brothers
and
sisters
been
suffered
from
infancy
to
tyrannize
over
nurses
governesses
and
servants
she
had
not
been
taught
to
moderate
her
desires
to
control
her
temper
or
bridle
her
will
or
to
sacrifice
her
own
pleasure
for
the
good
of
others
her
temper
being
naturally
good
she
was
never
violent
or
morose
but
from
constant
indulgence
and
habitual
scorn
of
reason
she
was
often
testy
and
capricious
her
mind
had
never
been
cultivated
her
intellect
at
best
was
somewhat
shallow
she
possessed
considerable
vivacity
some
quickness
of
perception
and
some
talent
for
music
and
the
acquisition
of
languages
but
till
fifteen
she
had
troubled
herself
to
acquire
nothing
the
love
of
display
had
roused
her
faculties
and
induced
her
to
apply
herself
but
only
to
the
more
showy
accomplishments
and
when
i
came
it
was
the
same
everything
was
neglected
but
french
german
music
singing
dancing
and
a
little
drawing
as
might
produce
the
greatest
show
with
the
smallest
labour
and
the
principal
parts
of
which
were
generally
done
by
me
for
music
and
singing
besides
my
occasional
instructions
she
had
the
attendance
of
the
best
master
the
country
afforded
and
in
these
accomplishments
as
well
as
in
dancing
she
certainly
attained
great
proficiency
to
music
indeed
she
devoted
too
much
of
her
time
as
governess
though
i
was
i
frequently
told
her
but
her
mother
thought
that
if
liked
it
she
not
give
too
much
time
to
the
acquisition
of
so
attractive
an
art
of
i
knew
nothing
but
what
i
gathered
from
my
pupil
and
my
own
observation
but
no
sooner
was
i
initiated
than
she
made
me
useful
in
twenty
different
ways
all
the
tedious
parts
of
her
work
were
shifted
on
to
my
shoulders
such
as
stretching
the
frames
stitching
in
the
canvas
sorting
the
wools
and
silks
putting
in
the
grounds
counting
the
stitches
rectifying
mistakes
and
finishing
the
pieces
she
was
tired
of
at
sixteen
miss
murray
was
something
of
a
romp
yet
not
more
so
than
is
natural
and
allowable
for
a
girl
of
that
age
but
at
seventeen
that
propensity
like
all
other
things
began
to
give
way
to
the
ruling
passion
and
soon
was
swallowed
up
in
the
ambition
to
attract
and
dazzle
the
other
sex
but
enough
of
her
now
let
us
turn
to
her
sister
miss
matilda
murray
was
a
veritable
hoyden
of
whom
little
need
be
said
she
was
about
two
years
and
a
half
younger
than
her
sister
her
features
were
larger
her
complexion
much
darker
she
might
possibly
make
a
handsome
woman
but
she
was
far
too
and
awkward
ever
to
be
called
a
pretty
girl
and
at
present
she
cared
little
about
it
rosalie
knew
all
her
charms
and
thought
them
even
greater
than
they
were
and
valued
them
more
highly
than
she
ought
to
have
done
had
they
been
three
times
as
great
matilda
thought
she
was
well
enough
but
cared
little
about
the
matter
still
less
did
she
care
about
the
cultivation
of
her
mind
and
the
acquisition
of
ornamental
accomplishments
the
manner
in
which
she
learnt
her
lessons
and
practised
her
music
was
calculated
to
drive
any
governess
to
despair
short
and
easy
as
her
tasks
were
if
done
at
all
they
were
slurred
over
at
any
time
and
in
any
way
but
generally
at
the
least
convenient
times
and
in
the
way
least
beneficial
to
herself
and
least
satisfactory
to
me
the
short
of
practising
was
horribly
strummed
through
she
meantime
unsparingly
abusing
me
either
for
interrupting
her
with
corrections
or
for
not
rectifying
her
mistakes
before
they
were
made
or
something
equally
unreasonable
once
or
twice
i
ventured
to
remonstrate
with
her
seriously
for
such
irrational
conduct
but
on
each
of
those
occasions
i
received
such
reprehensive
expostulations
from
her
mother
as
convinced
me
that
if
i
wished
to
keep
the
situation
i
must
even
let
miss
matilda
go
on
in
her
own
way
when
her
lessons
were
over
however
her
was
generally
over
too
while
riding
her
spirited
pony
or
romping
with
the
dogs
or
her
brothers
and
sister
but
especially
with
her
dear
brother
john
she
was
as
happy
as
a
lark
as
an
animal
matilda
was
all
right
full
of
life
vigour
and
activity
as
an
intelligent
being
she
was
barbarously
ignorant
indocile
careless
and
irrational
and
consequently
very
distressing
to
one
who
had
the
task
of
cultivating
her
understanding
reforming
her
manners
and
aiding
her
to
acquire
those
ornamental
attainments
which
unlike
her
sister
she
despised
as
much
as
the
rest
her
mother
was
partly
aware
of
her
deficiencies
and
gave
me
many
a
lecture
as
to
how
i
should
try
to
form
her
tastes
and
endeavour
to
rouse
and
cherish
her
dormant
vanity
and
by
insinuating
skilful
flattery
to
win
her
attention
to
the
desired
i
would
not
do
and
how
i
should
prepare
and
smooth
the
path
of
learning
till
she
could
glide
along
it
without
the
least
exertion
to
herself
which
i
could
not
for
nothing
can
be
taught
to
any
purpose
without
some
little
exertion
on
the
part
of
the
learner
as
a
moral
agent
matilda
was
reckless
headstrong
violent
and
unamenable
to
reason
one
proof
of
the
deplorable
state
of
her
mind
was
that
from
her
father
s
example
she
had
learned
to
swear
like
a
trooper
her
mother
was
greatly
shocked
at
the
trick
and
wondered
how
she
had
picked
it
but
you
can
soon
break
her
of
it
miss
grey
said
she
it
is
only
a
habit
and
if
you
will
just
gently
remind
her
every
time
she
does
so
i
am
sure
she
will
soon
lay
it
i
not
only
gently
reminded
her
i
tried
to
impress
upon
her
how
wrong
it
was
and
how
distressing
to
the
ears
of
decent
people
but
all
in
vain
i
was
only
answered
by
a
careless
laugh
and
oh
miss
grey
how
shocked
you
are
i
m
so
glad
or
well
i
can
t
help
it
papa
shouldn
t
have
taught
me
i
learned
it
all
from
him
and
maybe
a
bit
from
the
her
brother
john
master
murray
was
about
eleven
when
i
came
a
fine
stout
healthy
boy
frank
and
in
the
main
and
might
have
been
a
decent
lad
had
he
been
properly
educated
but
now
he
was
as
rough
as
a
young
bear
boisterous
unruly
unprincipled
untaught
least
for
a
governess
under
his
mother
s
eye
his
masters
at
school
might
be
able
to
manage
him
to
school
he
was
sent
greatly
to
my
relief
in
the
course
of
a
year
in
a
state
it
is
true
of
scandalous
ignorance
as
to
latin
as
well
as
the
more
useful
though
more
neglected
things
and
this
doubtless
would
all
be
laid
to
the
account
of
his
education
having
been
entrusted
to
an
ignorant
female
teacher
who
had
presumed
to
take
in
hand
what
she
was
wholly
incompetent
to
perform
i
was
not
delivered
from
his
brother
till
full
twelve
months
after
when
he
also
was
despatched
in
the
same
state
of
disgraceful
ignorance
as
the
former
master
charles
was
his
mother
s
peculiar
darling
he
was
little
more
than
a
year
younger
than
john
but
much
smaller
paler
and
less
active
and
robust
a
pettish
cowardly
capricious
selfish
little
fellow
only
active
in
doing
mischief
and
only
clever
in
inventing
falsehoods
not
simply
to
hide
his
faults
but
in
mere
malicious
wantonness
to
bring
odium
upon
others
in
fact
master
charles
was
a
very
great
nuisance
to
me
it
was
a
trial
of
patience
to
live
with
him
peaceably
to
watch
over
him
was
worse
and
to
teach
him
or
pretend
to
teach
him
was
inconceivable
at
ten
years
old
he
could
not
read
correctly
the
easiest
line
in
the
simplest
book
and
as
according
to
his
mother
s
principle
he
was
to
be
told
every
word
before
he
had
time
to
hesitate
or
examine
its
orthography
and
never
even
to
be
informed
as
a
stimulant
to
exertion
that
other
boys
were
more
forward
than
he
it
is
not
surprising
that
he
made
but
little
progress
during
the
two
years
i
had
charge
of
his
education
his
minute
portions
of
latin
grammar
were
to
be
repeated
over
to
him
till
he
chose
to
say
he
knew
them
and
then
he
was
to
be
helped
to
say
them
if
he
made
mistakes
in
his
little
easy
sums
in
arithmetic
they
were
to
be
shown
him
at
once
and
the
sum
done
for
him
instead
of
his
being
left
to
exercise
his
faculties
in
finding
them
out
himself
so
that
of
course
he
took
no
pains
to
avoid
mistakes
but
frequently
set
down
his
figures
at
random
without
any
calculation
at
all
i
did
not
invariably
confine
myself
to
these
rules
it
was
against
my
conscience
to
do
so
but
i
seldom
could
venture
to
deviate
from
them
in
the
slightest
degree
without
incurring
the
wrath
of
my
little
pupil
and
subsequently
of
his
mamma
to
whom
he
would
relate
my
transgressions
maliciously
exaggerated
or
adorned
with
embellishments
of
his
own
and
often
in
consequence
was
i
on
the
point
of
losing
or
resigning
my
situation
but
for
their
sakes
at
home
i
smothered
my
pride
and
suppressed
my
indignation
and
managed
to
struggle
on
till
my
little
tormentor
was
despatched
to
school
his
father
declaring
that
home
education
was
no
go
for
him
it
was
plain
his
mother
spoiled
him
outrageously
and
his
governess
could
make
no
hand
of
him
at
a
few
more
observations
about
horton
lodge
and
its
ongoings
and
i
have
done
with
dry
description
for
the
present
the
house
was
a
very
respectable
one
superior
to
bloomfield
s
both
in
age
size
and
magnificence
the
garden
was
not
so
tastefully
laid
out
but
instead
of
the
lawn
the
young
trees
guarded
by
palings
the
grove
of
upstart
poplars
and
the
plantation
of
firs
there
was
a
wide
park
stocked
with
deer
and
beautified
by
fine
old
trees
the
surrounding
country
itself
was
pleasant
as
far
as
fertile
fields
flourishing
trees
quiet
green
lanes
and
smiling
hedges
with
scattered
along
their
banks
could
make
it
but
it
was
depressingly
flat
to
one
born
and
nurtured
among
the
rugged
hills
of
we
were
situated
nearly
two
miles
from
the
village
church
and
consequently
the
family
carriage
was
put
in
requisition
every
sunday
morning
and
sometimes
oftener
and
murray
generally
thought
it
sufficient
to
show
themselves
at
church
once
in
the
course
of
the
day
but
frequently
the
children
preferred
going
a
second
time
to
wandering
about
the
grounds
all
the
day
with
nothing
to
do
if
some
of
my
pupils
chose
to
walk
and
take
me
with
them
it
was
well
for
me
for
otherwise
my
position
in
the
carriage
was
to
be
crushed
into
the
corner
farthest
from
the
open
window
and
with
my
back
to
the
horses
a
position
which
invariably
made
me
sick
and
if
i
were
not
actually
obliged
to
leave
the
church
in
the
middle
of
the
service
my
devotions
were
disturbed
with
a
feeling
of
languor
and
sickliness
and
the
tormenting
fear
of
its
becoming
worse
and
a
depressing
headache
was
generally
my
companion
throughout
the
day
which
would
otherwise
have
been
one
of
welcome
rest
and
holy
calm
enjoyment
it
s
very
odd
miss
grey
that
the
carriage
should
always
make
you
sick
it
never
makes
remarked
miss
matilda
nor
me
either
said
her
sister
but
i
dare
say
it
would
if
i
sat
where
she
a
nasty
horrid
place
miss
grey
i
wonder
how
you
can
bear
it
i
am
obliged
to
bear
it
since
no
choice
is
left
me
might
have
answered
but
in
tenderness
for
their
feelings
i
only
replied
oh
it
is
but
a
short
way
and
if
i
am
not
sick
in
church
i
don
t
mind
if
i
were
called
upon
to
give
a
description
of
the
usual
divisions
and
arrangements
of
the
day
i
should
find
it
a
very
difficult
matter
i
had
all
my
meals
in
the
schoolroom
with
my
pupils
at
such
times
as
suited
their
fancy
sometimes
they
would
ring
for
dinner
before
it
was
half
cooked
sometimes
they
would
keep
it
waiting
on
the
table
for
above
an
hour
and
then
be
out
of
humour
because
the
potatoes
were
cold
and
the
gravy
covered
with
cakes
of
solid
fat
sometimes
they
would
have
tea
at
four
frequently
they
would
storm
at
the
servants
because
it
was
not
in
precisely
at
five
and
when
these
orders
were
obeyed
by
way
of
encouragement
to
punctuality
they
would
keep
it
on
the
table
till
seven
or
eight
their
hours
of
study
were
managed
in
much
the
same
way
my
judgment
or
convenience
was
never
once
consulted
sometimes
matilda
and
john
would
determine
to
get
all
the
plaguy
business
over
before
breakfast
and
send
the
maid
to
call
me
up
at
five
without
any
scruple
or
apology
sometimes
i
was
told
to
be
ready
precisely
at
six
and
having
dressed
in
a
hurry
came
down
to
an
empty
room
and
after
waiting
a
long
time
in
suspense
discovered
that
they
had
changed
their
minds
and
were
still
in
bed
or
perhaps
if
it
were
a
fine
summer
morning
brown
would
come
to
tell
me
that
the
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
had
taken
a
holiday
and
were
gone
out
and
then
i
was
kept
waiting
for
breakfast
till
i
was
almost
ready
to
faint
they
having
fortified
themselves
with
something
before
they
went
often
they
would
do
their
lessons
in
the
open
air
which
i
had
nothing
to
say
against
except
that
i
frequently
caught
cold
by
sitting
on
the
damp
grass
or
from
exposure
to
the
evening
dew
or
some
insidious
draught
which
seemed
to
have
no
injurious
effect
on
them
it
was
quite
right
that
they
should
be
hardy
yet
surely
they
might
have
been
taught
some
consideration
for
others
who
were
less
so
but
i
must
not
blame
them
for
what
was
perhaps
my
own
fault
for
i
never
made
any
particular
objections
to
sitting
where
they
pleased
foolishly
choosing
to
risk
the
consequences
rather
than
trouble
them
for
my
convenience
their
indecorous
manner
of
doing
their
lessons
was
quite
as
remarkable
as
the
caprice
displayed
in
their
choice
of
time
and
place
while
receiving
my
instructions
or
repeating
what
they
had
learned
they
would
lounge
upon
the
sofa
lie
on
the
rug
stretch
yawn
talk
to
each
other
or
look
out
of
the
window
whereas
i
could
not
so
much
as
stir
the
fire
or
pick
up
the
handkerchief
i
had
dropped
without
being
rebuked
for
inattention
by
one
of
my
pupils
or
told
that
mamma
would
not
like
me
to
be
so
the
servants
seeing
in
what
little
estimation
the
governess
was
held
by
both
parents
and
children
regulated
their
behaviour
by
the
same
standard
i
have
frequently
stood
up
for
them
at
the
risk
of
some
injury
to
myself
against
the
tyranny
and
injustice
of
their
young
masters
and
mistresses
and
i
always
endeavoured
to
give
them
as
little
trouble
as
possible
but
they
entirely
neglected
my
comfort
despised
my
requests
and
slighted
my
directions
all
servants
i
am
convinced
would
not
have
done
so
but
domestics
in
general
being
ignorant
and
little
accustomed
to
reason
and
reflection
are
too
easily
corrupted
by
the
carelessness
and
bad
example
of
those
above
them
and
these
i
think
were
not
of
the
best
order
to
begin
with
i
sometimes
felt
myself
degraded
by
the
life
i
led
and
ashamed
of
submitting
to
so
many
indignities
and
sometimes
i
thought
myself
a
fool
for
caring
so
much
about
them
and
feared
i
must
be
sadly
wanting
in
christian
humility
or
that
charity
which
suffereth
long
and
is
kind
seeketh
not
her
own
is
not
easily
provoked
beareth
all
things
endureth
all
but
with
time
and
patience
matters
began
to
be
slightly
ameliorated
slowly
it
is
true
and
almost
imperceptibly
but
i
got
rid
of
my
male
pupils
that
was
no
trifling
advantage
and
the
girls
as
i
intimated
before
concerning
one
of
them
became
a
little
less
insolent
and
began
to
show
some
symptoms
of
esteem
miss
grey
was
a
queer
creature
she
never
flattered
and
did
not
praise
them
half
enough
but
whenever
she
did
speak
favourably
of
them
or
anything
belonging
to
them
they
could
be
quite
sure
her
approbation
was
sincere
she
was
very
obliging
quiet
and
peaceable
in
the
main
but
there
were
some
things
that
put
her
out
of
temper
they
did
not
much
care
for
that
to
be
sure
but
still
it
was
better
to
keep
her
in
tune
as
when
she
was
in
a
good
humour
she
would
talk
to
them
and
be
very
agreeable
and
amusing
sometimes
in
her
way
which
was
quite
different
to
mamma
s
but
still
very
well
for
a
change
she
had
her
own
opinions
on
every
subject
and
kept
steadily
to
tiresome
opinions
they
often
were
as
she
was
always
thinking
of
what
was
right
and
what
was
wrong
and
had
a
strange
reverence
for
matters
connected
with
religion
and
an
unaccountable
liking
to
good
chapter
coming
out
at
eighteen
miss
murray
was
to
emerge
from
the
quiet
obscurity
of
the
schoolroom
into
the
full
blaze
of
the
fashionable
much
of
it
at
least
as
could
be
had
out
of
london
for
her
papa
could
not
be
persuaded
to
leave
his
rural
pleasures
and
pursuits
even
for
a
few
weeks
residence
in
town
she
was
to
make
her
dÃ©but
on
the
third
of
january
at
a
magnificent
ball
which
her
mamma
proposed
to
give
to
all
the
nobility
and
choice
gentry
of
o
and
its
neighbourhood
for
twenty
miles
round
of
course
she
looked
forward
to
it
with
the
wildest
impatience
and
the
most
extravagant
anticipations
of
delight
miss
grey
said
she
one
evening
a
month
before
the
day
as
i
was
perusing
a
long
and
extremely
interesting
letter
of
my
sister
i
had
just
glanced
at
in
the
morning
to
see
that
it
contained
no
very
bad
news
and
kept
till
now
unable
before
to
find
a
quiet
moment
for
reading
it
miss
grey
do
put
away
that
dull
stupid
letter
and
listen
to
me
i
m
sure
my
talk
must
be
far
more
amusing
than
she
seated
herself
on
the
low
stool
at
my
feet
and
i
suppressing
a
sigh
of
vexation
began
to
fold
up
the
epistle
you
should
tell
the
good
people
at
home
not
to
bore
you
with
such
long
letters
said
she
and
above
all
do
bid
them
write
on
proper
and
not
on
those
great
vulgar
sheets
you
should
see
the
charming
little
notes
mamma
writes
to
her
the
good
people
at
home
replied
i
know
very
well
that
the
longer
their
letters
are
the
better
i
like
them
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
receive
a
charming
little
note
from
any
of
them
and
i
thought
you
were
too
much
of
a
lady
yourself
miss
murray
to
talk
about
the
vulgarity
of
writing
on
a
large
sheet
of
well
i
only
said
it
to
tease
you
but
now
i
want
to
talk
about
the
ball
and
to
tell
you
that
you
positively
must
put
off
your
holidays
till
it
is
why
so
shall
not
be
present
at
the
no
but
you
will
see
the
rooms
decked
out
before
it
begins
and
hear
the
music
and
above
all
see
me
in
my
splendid
new
dress
i
shall
be
so
charming
you
ll
be
ready
to
worship
really
must
i
should
like
to
see
you
very
much
but
i
shall
have
many
opportunities
of
seeing
you
equally
charming
on
the
occasion
of
some
of
the
numberless
balls
and
parties
that
are
to
be
and
i
can
not
disappoint
my
friends
by
postponing
my
return
so
oh
never
mind
your
friends
tell
them
we
won
t
let
you
but
to
say
the
truth
it
would
be
a
disappointment
to
myself
i
long
to
see
them
as
much
as
they
to
see
well
but
it
is
such
a
short
nearly
a
fortnight
by
my
computation
and
besides
i
can
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
a
christmas
spent
from
home
and
moreover
my
sister
is
going
to
be
is
not
till
next
month
but
i
want
to
be
there
to
assist
her
in
making
preparations
and
to
make
the
best
of
her
company
while
we
have
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
before
i
ve
only
got
the
news
in
this
letter
which
you
stigmatize
as
dull
and
stupid
and
won
t
let
me
to
whom
is
she
to
be
married
to
richardson
the
vicar
of
a
neighbouring
is
he
rich
no
only
is
he
handsome
no
only
young
no
only
oh
mercy
what
a
wretch
what
sort
of
a
house
is
it
a
quiet
little
vicarage
with
an
porch
an
garden
oh
stop
ll
make
me
sick
how
she
bear
it
i
expect
she
ll
not
only
be
able
to
bear
it
but
to
be
very
happy
you
did
not
ask
me
if
richardson
were
a
good
wise
or
amiable
man
i
could
have
answered
yes
to
all
these
least
so
mary
thinks
and
i
hope
she
will
not
find
herself
creature
how
can
she
think
of
spending
her
life
there
cooped
up
with
that
nasty
old
man
and
no
hope
of
change
he
is
not
old
he
s
only
six
or
seven
and
thirty
and
she
herself
is
and
as
sober
as
if
she
were
oh
that
s
better
re
well
matched
but
do
they
call
him
the
worthy
vicar
i
don
t
know
but
if
they
do
i
believe
he
merits
the
mercy
how
shocking
and
will
she
wear
a
white
apron
and
make
pies
and
puddings
i
don
t
know
about
the
white
apron
but
i
dare
say
she
will
make
pies
and
puddings
now
and
then
but
that
will
be
no
great
hardship
as
she
has
done
it
and
will
she
go
about
in
a
plain
shawl
and
a
large
straw
bonnet
carrying
tracts
and
bone
soup
to
her
husband
s
poor
parishioners
i
m
not
clear
about
that
but
i
dare
say
she
will
do
her
best
to
make
them
comfortable
in
body
and
mind
in
accordance
with
our
mother
s
chapter
ball
now
miss
grey
exclaimed
miss
murray
immediately
i
entered
the
schoolroom
after
having
taken
off
my
outdoor
garments
upon
returning
from
my
four
weeks
recreation
the
door
and
sit
down
and
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
the
it
no
shouted
miss
matilda
hold
your
tongue
can
t
ye
and
let
me
tell
her
about
my
new
a
splendour
miss
grey
a
fine
blood
do
be
quiet
matilda
and
let
me
tell
my
news
no
no
rosalie
you
ll
be
such
a
damned
long
time
over
shall
hear
me
ll
be
hanged
if
she
doesn
t
i
m
sorry
to
hear
miss
matilda
that
you
ve
not
got
rid
of
that
shocking
habit
well
i
can
t
help
it
but
i
ll
never
say
a
wicked
word
again
if
you
ll
only
listen
to
me
and
tell
rosalie
to
hold
her
confounded
rosalie
remonstrated
and
i
thought
i
should
have
been
torn
in
pieces
between
them
but
miss
matilda
having
the
loudest
voice
her
sister
at
length
gave
in
and
suffered
her
to
tell
her
story
first
so
i
was
doomed
to
hear
a
long
account
of
her
splendid
mare
its
breeding
and
pedigree
its
paces
its
action
its
spirit
and
of
her
own
amazing
skill
and
courage
in
riding
it
concluding
with
an
assertion
that
she
could
clear
a
gate
like
winking
that
papa
said
she
might
hunt
the
next
time
the
hounds
met
and
mamma
had
ordered
a
bright
scarlet
for
her
oh
matilda
what
stories
you
are
telling
exclaimed
her
sister
well
answered
she
no
whit
abashed
i
know
i
clear
a
gate
if
i
tried
and
papa
say
i
may
hunt
and
mamma
order
the
habit
when
i
ask
well
now
get
along
replied
miss
murray
and
do
dear
matilda
try
to
be
a
little
more
miss
grey
i
wish
you
would
tell
her
not
to
use
such
shocking
words
she
will
call
her
horse
a
mare
it
is
so
inconceivably
shocking
and
then
she
uses
such
dreadful
expressions
in
describing
it
she
must
have
learned
it
from
the
grooms
it
nearly
puts
me
into
fits
when
she
i
learned
it
from
papa
you
ass
and
his
jolly
friends
said
the
young
lady
vigorously
cracking
a
which
she
habitually
carried
in
her
hand
i
m
as
good
judge
of
horseflesh
as
the
best
of
well
now
get
along
you
shocking
girl
i
really
shall
take
a
fit
if
you
go
on
in
such
a
way
and
now
miss
grey
attend
to
me
i
m
going
to
tell
you
about
the
ball
you
must
be
dying
to
hear
about
it
i
know
oh
a
ball
you
never
saw
or
heard
or
read
or
dreamt
of
anything
like
it
in
all
your
life
the
decorations
the
entertainment
the
supper
the
music
were
indescribable
and
then
the
guests
there
were
two
noblemen
three
baronets
and
five
titled
ladies
and
other
ladies
and
gentlemen
innumerable
the
ladies
of
course
were
of
no
consequence
to
me
except
to
put
me
in
a
good
humour
with
myself
by
showing
how
ugly
and
awkward
most
of
them
were
and
the
best
mamma
told
me
most
transcendent
beauties
among
them
were
nothing
to
me
as
for
me
miss
m
so
you
didn
t
see
me
i
was
t
i
matilda
no
but
i
really
least
so
mamma
brown
and
williamson
brown
said
she
was
sure
no
gentleman
could
set
eyes
on
me
without
falling
in
love
that
minute
and
so
i
may
be
allowed
to
be
a
little
vain
i
know
you
think
me
a
shocking
conceited
frivolous
girl
but
then
you
know
i
don
t
attribute
it
to
my
personal
attractions
i
give
some
praise
to
the
hairdresser
and
some
to
my
exquisitely
lovely
must
see
it
gauze
over
pink
so
made
and
a
necklace
and
bracelet
of
beautiful
large
pearls
i
have
no
doubt
you
looked
very
charming
but
should
that
delight
you
so
very
much
oh
no
that
alone
but
then
i
was
so
much
admired
and
i
made
so
conquests
in
that
one
d
be
astonished
to
but
what
good
will
they
do
you
what
good
think
of
any
woman
asking
that
well
i
should
think
one
conquest
would
be
enough
and
too
much
unless
the
subjugation
were
oh
but
you
know
i
never
agree
with
you
on
those
points
now
wait
a
bit
and
i
ll
tell
you
my
principal
who
made
themselves
very
conspicuous
that
night
and
after
for
i
ve
been
to
two
parties
since
unfortunately
the
two
noblemen
lord
g
and
lord
f
were
married
or
i
might
have
condescended
to
be
particularly
gracious
to
as
it
was
i
did
not
though
lord
f
who
hates
his
wife
was
evidently
much
struck
with
me
he
asked
me
to
dance
with
him
is
a
charming
dancer
and
so
am
i
you
can
t
think
how
well
i
was
astonished
at
myself
my
lord
was
very
complimentary
too
much
so
in
i
thought
proper
to
be
a
little
haughty
and
repellent
but
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
his
nasty
cross
wife
ready
to
perish
with
spite
and
oh
miss
murray
you
don
t
mean
to
say
that
such
a
thing
could
really
give
you
pleasure
however
cross
well
i
know
it
s
very
wrong
never
mind
i
mean
to
be
good
some
don
t
preach
now
there
s
a
good
creature
i
haven
t
told
you
half
yet
let
me
see
oh
i
was
going
to
tell
you
how
many
unmistakeable
admirers
i
had
thomas
ashby
was
one
hugh
meltham
and
sir
broadley
wilson
are
old
codgers
only
fit
companions
for
papa
and
mamma
sir
thomas
is
young
rich
and
gay
but
an
ugly
beast
nevertheless
however
mamma
says
i
should
not
mind
that
after
a
few
months
acquaintance
then
there
was
henry
meltham
sir
hugh
s
younger
son
rather
and
a
pleasant
fellow
to
flirt
with
but
a
younger
son
that
is
all
he
is
good
for
then
there
was
young
green
rich
enough
but
of
no
family
and
a
great
stupid
fellow
a
mere
country
booby
and
then
our
good
rector
hatfield
an
admirer
he
ought
to
consider
himself
but
i
fear
he
has
forgotten
to
number
humility
among
his
stock
of
christian
was
hatfield
at
the
ball
yes
to
be
sure
did
you
think
he
was
too
good
to
go
i
thought
be
might
consider
it
by
no
means
he
did
not
profane
his
cloth
by
dancing
but
it
was
with
difficulty
he
could
refrain
poor
man
he
looked
as
if
he
were
dying
to
ask
my
hand
just
for
set
s
got
a
new
curate
that
seedy
old
fellow
bligh
has
got
his
living
at
last
and
is
and
what
is
the
new
one
like
oh
a
beast
weston
his
name
is
i
can
give
you
his
description
in
three
insensate
ugly
stupid
blockhead
that
s
four
but
no
of
then
she
returned
to
the
ball
and
gave
me
a
further
account
of
her
deportment
there
and
at
the
several
parties
she
had
since
attended
and
further
particulars
respecting
sir
thomas
ashby
and
meltham
green
and
hatfield
and
the
ineffaceable
impression
she
had
wrought
upon
each
of
them
well
which
of
the
four
do
you
like
best
said
i
suppressing
my
third
or
fourth
yawn
i
detest
them
all
replied
she
shaking
her
bright
ringlets
in
vivacious
scorn
that
means
i
suppose
i
like
them
all
which
most
no
i
really
detest
them
all
but
harry
meltham
is
the
handsomest
and
most
amusing
and
hatfield
the
cleverest
sir
thomas
the
wickedest
and
green
the
most
stupid
but
the
one
i
m
to
have
i
suppose
if
i
m
doomed
to
have
any
of
them
is
sir
thomas
surely
not
if
he
s
so
wicked
and
if
you
dislike
him
oh
i
don
t
mind
his
being
wicked
he
s
all
the
better
for
that
and
as
for
disliking
shouldn
t
greatly
object
to
being
lady
ashby
of
ashby
park
if
i
must
marry
but
if
i
could
be
always
young
i
would
be
always
single
i
should
like
to
enjoy
myself
thoroughly
and
coquet
with
all
the
world
till
i
am
on
the
verge
of
being
called
an
old
maid
and
then
to
escape
the
infamy
of
that
after
having
made
ten
thousand
conquests
to
break
all
their
hearts
save
one
by
marrying
some
rich
indulgent
husband
whom
on
the
other
hand
fifty
ladies
were
dying
to
well
as
long
as
you
entertain
these
views
keep
single
by
all
means
and
never
marry
at
all
not
even
to
escape
the
infamy
of
chapter
church
well
miss
grey
what
do
you
think
of
the
new
curate
asked
miss
murray
on
our
return
from
church
the
sunday
after
the
recommencement
of
our
duties
i
can
scarcely
tell
was
my
reply
i
have
not
even
heard
him
well
but
you
saw
him
didn
t
you
yes
but
i
can
not
pretend
to
judge
of
a
man
s
character
by
a
single
cursory
glance
at
his
but
isn
t
he
ugly
he
did
not
strike
me
as
being
particularly
so
i
don
t
dislike
that
cast
of
countenance
but
the
only
thing
i
particularly
noticed
about
him
was
his
style
of
reading
which
appeared
to
me
better
at
least
than
hatfield
s
he
read
the
lessons
as
if
he
were
bent
on
giving
full
effect
to
every
passage
it
seemed
as
if
the
most
careless
person
could
not
have
helped
attending
nor
the
most
ignorant
have
failed
to
understand
and
the
prayers
he
read
as
if
he
were
not
reading
at
all
but
praying
earnestly
and
sincerely
from
his
own
oh
yes
that
s
all
he
is
good
for
he
can
plod
through
the
service
well
enough
but
he
has
not
a
single
idea
beyond
how
do
you
know
oh
i
know
perfectly
well
i
am
an
excellent
judge
in
such
matters
did
you
see
how
he
went
out
of
church
stumping
if
there
were
nobody
there
but
looking
to
the
right
hand
or
the
left
and
evidently
thinking
of
nothing
but
just
getting
out
of
the
church
and
perhaps
home
to
his
dinner
his
great
stupid
head
could
contain
no
other
i
suppose
you
would
have
had
him
cast
a
glance
into
the
squire
s
pew
said
i
laughing
at
the
vehemence
of
her
hostility
indeed
i
should
have
been
highly
indignant
if
he
had
dared
to
do
such
a
thing
replied
she
haughtily
tossing
her
head
then
after
a
moment
s
reflection
she
well
well
i
suppose
he
s
good
enough
for
his
place
but
i
m
glad
i
m
not
dependent
on
for
s
all
did
you
see
how
hatfield
hurried
out
to
get
a
bow
from
me
and
be
in
time
to
put
us
into
the
carriage
yes
answered
i
internally
adding
and
i
thought
it
somewhat
derogatory
to
his
dignity
as
a
clergyman
to
come
flying
from
the
pulpit
in
such
eager
haste
to
shake
hands
with
the
squire
and
hand
his
wife
and
daughters
into
their
carriage
and
moreover
i
owe
him
a
grudge
for
nearly
shutting
me
out
of
it
for
in
fact
though
i
was
standing
before
his
face
close
beside
the
carriage
steps
waiting
to
get
in
he
would
persist
in
putting
them
up
and
closing
the
door
till
one
of
the
family
stopped
him
by
calling
out
that
the
governess
was
not
in
yet
then
without
a
word
of
apology
he
departed
wishing
them
and
leaving
the
footman
to
finish
the
business
hatfield
never
spoke
to
me
neither
did
sir
hugh
or
lady
meltham
nor
harry
or
miss
meltham
nor
green
or
his
sisters
nor
any
other
lady
or
gentleman
who
frequented
that
church
nor
in
fact
any
one
that
visited
at
horton
lodge
miss
murray
ordered
the
carriage
again
in
the
afternoon
for
herself
and
her
sister
she
said
it
was
too
cold
for
them
to
enjoy
themselves
in
the
garden
and
besides
she
believed
harry
meltham
would
be
at
church
for
said
she
smiling
slyly
at
her
own
fair
image
in
the
glass
he
has
been
a
most
exemplary
attendant
at
church
these
last
few
sundays
you
would
think
he
was
quite
a
good
christian
and
you
may
go
with
us
miss
grey
i
want
you
to
see
him
he
is
so
greatly
improved
since
he
returned
from
can
t
think
and
besides
then
you
will
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
beautiful
weston
again
and
of
hearing
him
i
did
hear
him
preach
and
was
decidedly
pleased
with
the
evangelical
truth
of
his
doctrine
as
well
as
the
earnest
simplicity
of
his
manner
and
the
clearness
and
force
of
his
style
it
was
truly
refreshing
to
hear
such
a
sermon
after
being
so
long
accustomed
to
the
dry
prosy
discourses
of
the
former
curate
and
the
still
less
edifying
harangues
of
the
rector
hatfield
would
come
sailing
up
the
aisle
or
rather
sweeping
along
like
a
whirlwind
with
his
rich
silk
gown
flying
behind
him
and
rustling
against
the
pew
doors
mount
the
pulpit
like
a
conqueror
ascending
his
triumphal
car
then
sinking
on
the
velvet
cushion
in
an
attitude
of
studied
grace
remain
in
silent
prostration
for
a
certain
time
then
mutter
over
a
collect
and
gabble
through
the
lord
s
prayer
rise
draw
off
one
bright
lavender
glove
to
give
the
congregation
the
benefit
of
his
sparkling
rings
lightly
pass
his
fingers
through
his
hair
flourish
a
cambric
handkerchief
recite
a
very
short
passage
or
perhaps
a
mere
phrase
of
scripture
as
a
to
his
discourse
and
finally
deliver
a
composition
which
as
a
composition
might
be
considered
good
though
far
too
studied
and
too
artificial
to
be
pleasing
to
me
the
propositions
were
well
laid
down
the
arguments
logically
conducted
and
yet
it
was
sometimes
hard
to
listen
quietly
throughout
without
some
slight
demonstrations
of
disapproval
or
impatience
his
favourite
subjects
were
church
discipline
rites
and
ceremonies
apostolical
succession
the
duty
of
reverence
and
obedience
to
the
clergy
the
atrocious
criminality
of
dissent
the
absolute
necessity
of
observing
all
the
forms
of
godliness
the
reprehensible
presumption
of
individuals
who
attempted
to
think
for
themselves
in
matters
connected
with
religion
or
to
be
guided
by
their
own
interpretations
of
scripture
and
occasionally
to
please
his
wealthy
parishioners
the
necessity
of
deferential
obedience
from
the
poor
to
the
his
maxims
and
exhortations
throughout
with
quotations
from
the
fathers
with
whom
he
appeared
to
be
far
better
acquainted
than
with
the
apostles
and
evangelists
and
whose
importance
he
seemed
to
consider
at
least
equal
to
theirs
but
now
and
then
he
gave
us
a
sermon
of
a
different
some
would
call
a
very
good
one
but
sunless
and
severe
representing
the
deity
as
a
terrible
taskmaster
rather
than
a
benevolent
father
yet
as
i
listened
i
felt
inclined
to
think
the
man
was
sincere
in
all
he
said
he
must
have
changed
his
views
and
become
decidedly
religious
gloomy
and
austere
yet
still
devout
but
such
illusions
were
usually
dissipated
on
coming
out
of
church
by
hearing
his
voice
in
jocund
colloquy
with
some
of
the
melthams
or
greens
or
perhaps
the
murrays
themselves
probably
laughing
at
his
own
sermon
and
hoping
that
he
had
given
the
rascally
people
something
to
think
about
perchance
exulting
in
the
thought
that
old
betty
holmes
would
now
lay
aside
the
sinful
indulgence
of
her
pipe
which
had
been
her
daily
solace
for
upwards
of
thirty
years
that
george
higgins
would
be
frightened
out
of
his
sabbath
evening
walks
and
thomas
jackson
would
be
sorely
troubled
in
his
conscience
and
shaken
in
his
sure
and
certain
hope
of
a
joyful
resurrection
at
the
last
day
thus
i
could
not
but
conclude
that
hatfield
was
one
of
those
who
bind
heavy
burdens
and
grievous
to
be
borne
and
lay
them
upon
men
s
shoulders
while
they
themselves
will
not
move
them
with
one
of
their
fingers
and
who
make
the
word
of
god
of
none
effect
by
their
traditions
teaching
for
doctrines
the
commandments
of
i
was
well
pleased
to
observe
that
the
new
curate
resembled
him
as
far
as
i
could
see
in
none
of
these
particulars
well
miss
grey
what
do
you
think
of
him
now
said
miss
murray
as
we
took
our
places
in
the
carriage
after
service
no
harm
still
replied
i
no
harm
repeated
she
in
amazement
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
i
think
no
worse
of
him
than
i
did
no
worse
i
should
think
not
the
contrary
is
he
not
greatly
improved
oh
yes
very
much
indeed
replied
i
for
i
had
now
discovered
that
it
was
harry
meltham
she
meant
not
weston
that
gentleman
had
eagerly
come
forward
to
speak
to
the
young
ladies
a
thing
he
would
hardly
have
ventured
to
do
had
their
mother
been
present
he
had
likewise
politely
handed
them
into
the
carriage
he
had
not
attempted
to
shut
me
out
like
hatfield
neither
of
course
had
he
offered
me
his
assistance
i
should
not
have
accepted
it
if
he
had
but
as
long
as
the
door
remained
open
he
had
stood
smirking
and
chatting
with
them
and
then
lifted
his
hat
and
departed
to
his
own
abode
but
i
had
scarcely
noticed
him
all
the
time
my
companions
however
had
been
more
observant
and
as
we
rolled
along
they
discussed
between
them
not
only
his
looks
words
and
actions
but
every
feature
of
his
face
and
every
article
of
his
apparel
you
shan
t
have
him
all
to
yourself
rosalie
said
miss
matilda
at
the
close
of
this
discussion
i
like
him
i
know
he
d
make
a
nice
jolly
companion
for
well
you
re
quite
welcome
to
him
matilda
replied
her
sister
in
a
tone
of
affected
indifference
and
i
m
sure
continued
the
other
he
admires
me
quite
as
much
as
he
does
you
doesn
t
he
miss
grey
i
don
t
know
i
m
not
acquainted
with
his
well
but
he
my
matilda
nobody
will
ever
admire
you
till
you
get
rid
of
your
rough
awkward
oh
stuff
harry
meltham
likes
such
manners
and
so
do
papa
s
well
you
captivate
old
men
and
younger
sons
but
nobody
else
i
am
sure
will
ever
take
a
fancy
to
i
don
t
care
i
m
not
always
grabbing
after
money
like
you
and
mamma
if
my
husband
is
able
to
keep
a
few
good
horses
and
dogs
i
shall
be
quite
satisfied
and
all
the
rest
may
go
to
the
devil
well
if
you
use
such
shocking
expressions
i
m
sure
no
real
gentleman
will
ever
venture
to
come
near
you
really
miss
grey
you
should
not
let
her
do
i
can
t
possibly
prevent
it
miss
and
you
re
quite
mistaken
matilda
in
supposing
that
harry
meltham
admires
you
i
assure
you
he
does
nothing
of
the
matilda
was
beginning
an
angry
reply
but
happily
our
journey
was
now
at
an
end
and
the
contention
was
cut
short
by
the
footman
opening
the
and
letting
down
the
steps
for
our
descent
chapter
cottagers
as
i
had
now
only
one
regular
she
contrived
to
give
me
as
much
trouble
as
three
or
four
ordinary
ones
and
though
her
sister
still
took
lessons
in
german
and
had
considerably
more
time
at
my
own
disposal
than
i
had
ever
been
blessed
with
before
since
i
had
taken
upon
me
the
governess
s
yoke
which
time
i
devoted
partly
to
correspondence
with
my
friends
partly
to
reading
study
and
the
practice
of
music
singing
partly
to
wandering
in
the
grounds
or
adjacent
fields
with
my
pupils
if
they
wanted
me
alone
if
they
did
not
often
when
they
had
no
more
agreeable
occupation
at
hand
the
misses
murray
would
amuse
themselves
with
visiting
the
poor
cottagers
on
their
father
s
estate
to
receive
their
flattering
homage
or
to
hear
the
old
stories
or
gossiping
news
of
the
garrulous
old
women
or
perhaps
to
enjoy
the
purer
pleasure
of
making
the
poor
people
happy
with
their
cheering
presence
and
their
occasional
gifts
so
easily
bestowed
so
thankfully
received
sometimes
i
was
called
upon
to
accompany
one
or
both
of
the
sisters
in
these
visits
and
sometimes
i
was
desired
to
go
alone
to
fulfil
some
promise
which
they
had
been
more
ready
to
make
than
to
perform
to
carry
some
small
donation
or
read
to
one
who
was
sick
or
seriously
disposed
and
thus
i
made
a
few
acquaintances
among
the
cottagers
and
occasionally
i
went
to
see
them
on
my
own
account
i
generally
had
more
satisfaction
in
going
alone
than
with
either
of
the
young
ladies
for
they
chiefly
owing
to
their
defective
education
comported
themselves
towards
their
inferiors
in
a
manner
that
was
highly
disagreeable
for
me
to
witness
they
never
in
thought
exchanged
places
with
them
and
consequently
had
no
consideration
for
their
feelings
regarding
them
as
an
order
of
beings
entirely
different
from
themselves
they
would
watch
the
poor
creatures
at
their
meals
making
uncivil
remarks
about
their
food
and
their
manner
of
eating
they
would
laugh
at
their
simple
notions
and
provincial
expressions
till
some
of
them
scarcely
durst
venture
to
speak
they
would
call
the
grave
elderly
men
and
women
old
fools
and
silly
old
blockheads
to
their
faces
and
all
this
without
meaning
to
offend
i
could
see
that
the
people
were
often
hurt
and
annoyed
by
such
conduct
though
their
fear
of
the
grand
ladies
prevented
them
from
testifying
any
resentment
but
never
perceived
it
they
thought
that
as
these
cottagers
were
poor
and
untaught
they
must
be
stupid
and
brutish
and
as
long
as
they
their
superiors
condescended
to
talk
to
them
and
to
give
them
shillings
and
or
articles
of
clothing
they
had
a
right
to
amuse
themselves
even
at
their
expense
and
the
people
must
adore
them
as
angels
of
light
condescending
to
minister
to
their
necessities
and
enlighten
their
humble
dwellings
i
made
many
and
various
attempts
to
deliver
my
pupils
from
these
delusive
notions
without
alarming
their
was
easily
offended
and
not
soon
with
little
apparent
result
and
i
know
not
which
was
the
more
reprehensible
of
the
two
matilda
was
more
rude
and
boisterous
but
from
rosalie
s
womanly
age
and
exterior
better
things
were
expected
yet
she
was
as
provokingly
careless
and
inconsiderate
as
a
giddy
child
of
twelve
one
bright
day
in
the
last
week
of
february
i
was
walking
in
the
park
enjoying
the
threefold
luxury
of
solitude
a
book
and
pleasant
weather
for
miss
matilda
had
set
out
on
her
daily
ride
and
miss
murray
was
gone
in
the
carriage
with
her
mamma
to
pay
some
morning
calls
but
it
struck
me
that
i
ought
to
leave
these
selfish
pleasures
and
the
park
with
its
glorious
canopy
of
bright
blue
sky
the
west
wind
sounding
through
its
yet
leafless
branches
the
still
lingering
in
its
hollows
but
melting
fast
beneath
the
sun
and
the
graceful
deer
browsing
on
its
moist
herbage
already
assuming
the
freshness
and
verdure
of
go
to
the
cottage
of
one
nancy
brown
a
widow
whose
son
was
at
work
all
day
in
the
fields
and
who
was
afflicted
with
an
inflammation
in
the
eyes
which
had
for
some
time
incapacitated
her
from
reading
to
her
own
great
grief
for
she
was
a
woman
of
a
serious
thoughtful
turn
of
mind
i
accordingly
went
and
found
her
alone
as
usual
in
her
little
close
dark
cottage
redolent
of
smoke
and
confined
air
but
as
tidy
and
clean
as
she
could
make
it
she
was
seated
beside
her
little
fire
consisting
of
a
few
red
cinders
and
a
bit
of
stick
busily
knitting
with
a
small
sackcloth
cushion
at
her
feet
placed
for
the
accommodation
of
her
gentle
friend
the
cat
who
was
seated
thereon
with
her
long
tail
half
encircling
her
velvet
paws
and
her
eyes
dreamily
gazing
on
the
low
crooked
fender
well
nancy
how
are
you
why
middling
miss
i
eyes
is
no
better
but
i
m
a
deal
easier
i
my
mind
nor
i
have
been
replied
she
rising
to
welcome
me
with
a
contented
smile
which
i
was
glad
to
see
for
nancy
had
been
somewhat
afflicted
with
religious
melancholy
i
congratulated
her
upon
the
change
she
agreed
that
it
was
a
great
blessing
and
expressed
herself
right
down
thankful
for
it
adding
if
it
please
god
to
spare
my
sight
and
make
me
so
as
i
can
read
my
bible
again
i
think
i
shall
be
as
happy
as
a
i
hope
he
will
nancy
replied
i
and
meantime
i
ll
come
and
read
to
you
now
and
then
when
i
have
a
little
time
to
with
expressions
of
grateful
pleasure
the
poor
woman
moved
to
get
me
a
chair
but
as
i
saved
her
the
trouble
she
busied
herself
with
stirring
the
fire
and
adding
a
few
more
sticks
to
the
decaying
embers
and
then
taking
her
bible
from
the
shelf
dusted
it
carefully
and
gave
it
me
on
my
asking
if
there
was
any
particular
part
she
should
like
me
to
read
she
well
miss
grey
if
it
s
all
the
same
to
you
i
should
like
to
hear
that
chapter
in
the
first
epistle
of
john
that
says
god
is
love
and
he
that
dwelleth
in
love
dwelleth
in
god
and
god
in
with
a
little
searching
i
found
these
words
in
the
fourth
chapter
when
i
came
to
the
seventh
verse
she
interrupted
me
and
with
needless
apologies
for
such
a
liberty
desired
me
to
read
it
very
slowly
that
she
might
take
it
all
in
and
dwell
on
every
word
hoping
i
would
excuse
her
as
she
was
but
a
simple
the
wisest
person
i
replied
might
think
over
each
of
these
verses
for
an
hour
and
be
all
the
better
for
it
and
i
would
rather
read
them
slowly
than
accordingly
i
finished
the
chapter
as
slowly
as
need
be
and
at
the
same
time
as
impressively
as
i
could
my
auditor
listened
most
attentively
all
the
while
and
sincerely
thanked
me
when
i
had
done
i
sat
still
about
half
a
minute
to
give
her
time
to
reflect
upon
it
when
somewhat
to
my
surprise
she
broke
the
pause
by
asking
me
how
i
liked
weston
i
don
t
know
i
replied
a
little
startled
by
the
suddenness
of
the
question
i
think
he
preaches
very
ay
he
does
so
and
talks
well
does
he
he
does
maybe
you
haven
t
seen
to
talk
to
him
much
yet
no
i
never
see
any
one
to
talk
the
young
ladies
of
the
ah
they
re
nice
kind
young
ladies
but
they
can
t
talk
as
he
then
he
comes
to
see
you
nancy
he
does
miss
and
i
se
thankful
for
it

to
see
all

house
they
say
he
s
sure
to
find
summut
wrong
and
begin
em
as
soon
as
he
crosses
th
doorstuns
but
maybe
he
thinks
it
his
duty
like
to
tell
em
what
s
wrong
and
very
oft
he
comes
o
purpose
to
reprove
folk
for
not

to
church
or
not
kneeling
an
standing
when

come
when
i
was
so
ill
troubled
in
my
mind
and
as
i
had
only
very
poor
health
besides
i
made
bold
to
send
for
he
came
right
enough
i
was
sore
distressed
miss
god
it
s
owered
when
i
took
my
bible
i
could
get
no
comfort
of
it
at
all
that
very
chapter
at
you
ve
just
been
reading
troubled
me
as
much
as
he
that
loveth
not
knoweth
not
it
seemed
fearsome
to
me
for
i
felt
that
i
loved
neither
god
nor
man
as
i
should
do
and
could
not
if
i
tried
ever
so
and
th
chapter
afore
where
it
says
he
that
is
born
of
god
can
not
commit
and
another
place
where
it
says
love
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
and
many
many
others
miss
i
should
fair
weary
you
out
if
i
was
to
tell
them
all
but
all
seemed
to
condemn
me
and
to
show
me
at
i
was
not
in
the
right
way
and
as
i
knew
not
how
to
get
into
it
i
sent
our
bill
to
beg
maister
hatfield
to
be
as
kind
as
look
in
on
me
some
day
and
when
he
came
i
telled
him
all
my
and
what
did
he
say
nancy
why
miss
he
seemed
to
scorn
me
i
might
be
mista
he
like
gave
a
sort
of
a
whistle
and
i
saw
a
bit
of
a
smile
on
his
face
and
he
said
oh
it
s
all
stuff
you
ve
been
among
the
methodists
my
good
but
i
telled
him
i
d
never
been
near
the
methodies
and
then
he
said
well
says
he
you
must
come
to
church
where
you
ll
hear
the
scriptures
properly
explained
instead
of
sitting
poring
over
your
bible
at
but
i
telled
him
i
always
used
coming
to
church
when
i
had
my
health
but
this
very
cold
winter
weather
i
hardly
durst
venture
so
me
so
bad
wi
th
rheumatic
and
all
but
he
says
it
ll
do
your
rheumatiz
good
to
hobble
to
church
there
s
nothing
like
exercise
for
the
rheumatiz
you
can
walk
about
the
house
well
enough
why
can
t
you
walk
to
church
the
fact
is
says
he
you
re
getting
too
fond
of
your
ease
it
s
always
easy
to
find
excuses
for
shirking
one
s
but
then
you
know
miss
grey
it
wasn
t
so
however
i
telled
him
i
d
try
but
please
sir
says
i
if
i
do
go
to
church
what
the
better
shall
i
be
i
want
to
have
my
sins
blotted
out
and
to
feel
that
they
are
remembered
no
more
against
me
and
that
the
love
of
god
is
shed
abroad
in
my
heart
and
if
i
can
get
no
good
by
reading
my
bible
an
saying
my
prayers
at
home
what
good
shall
i
get
by
going
to
church
the
church
says
he
is
the
place
appointed
by
god
for
his
worship
it
s
your
duty
to
go
there
as
often
as
you
can
if
you
want
comfort
you
must
seek
it
in
the
path
of
duty
a
deal
more
he
said
but
i
can
not
remember
all
his
fine
words
however
it
all
came
to
this
that
i
was
to
come
to
church
as
oft
as
ever
i
could
and
bring
my
with
me
an
read
up
all
the
sponsers
after
the
clerk
an
stand
an
kneel
an
sit
an
do
all
as
i
should
and
take
the
lord
s
supper
at
every
opportunity
an
hearken
his
sermons
and
maister
bligh
s
an
it
ud
be
all
right
if
i
went
on
doing
my
duty
i
should
get
a
blessing
at
last
but
if
you
get
no
comfort
that
way
says
he
it
s
all
then
sir
says
i
should
you
think
i
m
a
reprobate
why
says
says
if
you
do
your
best
to
get
to
heaven
and
can
t
manage
it
you
must
be
one
of
those
that
seek
to
enter
in
at
the
strait
gate
and
shall
not
be
an
then
he
asked
me
if
i
d
seen
any
of
the
ladies
o
th
hall
about
that
mornin
so
i
telled
him
where
i
had
seen
the
young
misses
go
on
th
moss
lane
he
kicked
my
poor
cat
right
across
th
floor
an
went
after
em
as
gay
as
a
lark
but
i
was
very
sad
that
last
word
o
his
fair
sunk
into
my
heart
an
lay
there
like
a
lump
o
lead
till
i
was
weary
to
bear
it
howsever
i
follered
his
advice
i
thought
he
meant
it
all
for
th
best
though
he
a
queer
way
with
him
but
you
know
miss
he
s
rich
an
young
and
such
like
can
not
right
understand
the
thoughts
of
a
poor
old
woman
such
as
me
but
howsever
i
did
my
best
to
do
all
as
he
bade
maybe
i
m
plaguing
you
miss
wi
my
oh
no
nancy
go
on
and
tell
me
well
my
rheumatiz
got
know
not
whether
wi
going
to
church
or
not
but
one
frosty
sunday
i
got
this
cold
i
my
eyes
th
inflammation
didn
t
come
on
all
at
once
like
but
bit
by
i
wasn
t
going
to
tell
you
about
my
eyes
i
was
talking
about
my
trouble
o
mind
to
tell
the
truth
miss
grey
i
don
t
think
it
was
anyways
eased
by
coming
to
to
speak
on
at
least
i
like
got
my
health
better
but
that
didn
t
mend
my
soul
i
hearkened
and
hearkened
the
ministers
and
read
an
read
at
my
but
it
was
all
like
sounding
brass
and
a
tinkling
cymbal
the
sermons
i
couldn
t
understand
an
th
only
served
to
show
me
how
wicked
i
was
that
i
could
read
such
good
words
an
never
be
no
better
for
it
and
oftens
feel
it
a
sore
labour
an
a
heavy
task
beside
instead
of
a
blessing
and
a
privilege
as
all
good
christians
does
it
seemed
like
as
all
were
barren
an
dark
to
me
and
then
them
dreadful
words
many
shall
seek
to
enter
in
and
shall
not
be
they
like
as
they
fair
dried
up
my
sperrit
but
one
sunday
when
maister
hatfield
gave
out
about
the
sacrament
i
noticed
where
he
said
if
there
be
any
of
you
that
can
not
quiet
his
own
conscience
but
requireth
further
comfort
or
counsel
let
him
come
to
me
or
some
other
discreet
and
learned
minister
of
god
s
word
and
open
his
grief
so
next
sunday
morning
afore
service
i
just
looked
into
the
vestry
an
began
to
th
rector
again
i
hardly
could
fashion
to
take
such
a
liberty
but
i
thought
when
my
soul
was
at
stake
i
shouldn
t
stick
at
a
trifle
but
he
said
he
hadn
t
time
to
attend
to
me
then
and
indeed
says
he
i
ve
nothing
to
say
to
you
but
what
i
ve
said
before
take
the
sacrament
of
course
and
go
on
doing
your
duty
and
if
that
won
t
serve
you
nothing
will
so
don
t
bother
me
any
so
then
i
went
away
but
i
heard
maister
weston
was
there
was
his
first
sunday
at
horton
you
know
an
he
was
i
th
vestry
in
his
surplice
helping
th
rector
on
with
his
yes
and
i
heard
him
ask
maister
hatfield
who
i
was
an
he
says
oh
she
s
a
canting
old
and
i
was
very
ill
grieved
miss
grey
but
i
went
to
my
seat
and
i
tried
to
do
my
duty
as
aforetime
but
i
like
got
no
peace
an
i
even
took
the
sacrament
but
i
felt
as
though
i
were
eating
and
drinking
to
my
own
damnation
all
th
time
so
i
went
home
sorely
troubled
but
next
day
afore
i
d
gotten
fettled
indeed
miss
i
d
no
heart
to
sweeping
an
fettling
an
washing
pots
so
i
sat
me
down
i
th
should
come
in
but
maister
weston
i
started
siding
stuff
then
an
sweeping
an
doing
and
i
expected
he
d
begin
me
for
my
idle
ways
as
maister
hatfield
would
a
done
but
i
was
mista
en
he
only
bid
me
like
in
a
quiet
dacent
way
so
i
dusted
him
a
chair
an
fettled
up
th
fireplace
a
bit
but
i
hadn
t
forgotten
th
rector
s
words
so
says
i
i
wonder
sir
you
should
give
yourself
that
trouble
to
come
so
far
to
see
a
canting
old
fool
such
as
he
seemed
taken
aback
at
that
but
he
would
fain
persuade
me
at
the
rector
was
only
in
jest
and
when
that
wouldn
t
do
he
says
well
nancy
you
shouldn
t
think
so
much
about
it
hatfield
was
a
little
out
of
humour
just
then
you
know
we
re
none
of
us
moses
spoke
unadvisedly
with
his
lips
but
now
sit
down
a
minute
if
you
can
spare
the
time
and
tell
me
all
your
doubts
and
fears
and
i
ll
try
to
remove
so
i
sat
me
down
anent
him
he
was
quite
a
stranger
you
know
miss
grey
and
even
nor
maister
hatfield
i
believe
and
i
had
thought
him
not
so
as
him
and
rather
a
bit
crossish
at
first
to
look
at
but
he
spake
so
civil
when
th
cat
poor
thing
jumped
on
to
his
knee
he
only
stroked
her
and
gave
a
bit
of
a
smile
so
i
thought
that
was
a
good
sign
for
once
when
she
did
so
to
th
rector
he
knocked
her
off
like
as
it
might
be
in
scorn
and
anger
poor
thing
but
you
can
t
expect
a
cat
to
know
manners
like
a
christian
you
know
miss
no
of
course
not
nancy
but
what
did
weston
say
then
he
said
nought
but
he
listened
to
me
as
steady
an
patient
as
could
be
an
never
a
bit
o
scorn
about
him
so
i
went
on
an
telled
him
all
just
as
i
ve
telled
more
too
well
says
he
mr
hatfield
was
quite
right
in
telling
you
to
persevere
in
doing
your
duty
but
in
advising
you
to
go
to
church
and
attend
to
the
service
and
so
on
he
didn
t
mean
that
was
the
whole
of
a
christian
s
duty
he
only
thought
you
might
there
learn
what
more
was
to
be
done
and
be
led
to
take
delight
in
those
exercises
instead
of
finding
them
a
task
and
a
burden
and
if
you
had
asked
him
to
explain
those
words
that
trouble
you
so
much
i
think
he
would
have
told
you
that
if
many
shall
seek
to
enter
in
at
the
strait
gate
and
shall
not
be
able
it
is
their
own
sins
that
hinder
them
just
as
a
man
with
a
large
sack
on
his
back
might
wish
to
pass
through
a
narrow
doorway
and
find
it
impossible
to
do
so
unless
he
would
leave
his
sack
behind
him
but
you
nancy
i
dare
say
have
no
sins
that
you
would
not
gladly
throw
aside
if
you
knew
how
indeed
sir
you
speak
truth
said
i
well
says
he
you
know
the
first
and
great
the
second
which
is
like
unto
which
two
commandments
hang
all
the
law
and
the
prophets
you
say
you
can
not
love
god
but
it
strikes
me
that
if
you
rightly
consider
who
and
what
he
is
you
can
not
help
it
he
is
your
father
your
best
friend
every
blessing
everything
good
pleasant
or
useful
comes
from
him
and
everything
evil
everything
you
have
reason
to
hate
to
shun
or
to
fear
comes
from
enemy
as
well
as
ours
and
for
cause
was
god
manifest
in
the
flesh
that
he
might
destroy
the
works
of
the
devil
in
one
word
god
is
love
and
the
more
of
love
we
have
within
us
the
nearer
we
are
to
him
and
the
more
of
his
spirit
we
well
sir
i
said
if
i
can
always
think
on
these
things
i
think
i
might
well
love
god
but
how
can
i
love
my
neighbours
when
they
vex
me
and
be
so
contrary
and
sinful
as
some
on
em
is
it
may
seem
a
hard
matter
says
he
to
love
our
neighbours
who
have
so
much
of
what
is
evil
about
them
and
whose
faults
so
often
awaken
the
evil
that
lingers
within
ourselves
but
remember
that
made
them
and
loves
them
and
whosoever
loveth
him
that
begat
loveth
him
that
is
begotten
also
and
if
god
so
loveth
us
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
son
to
die
for
us
we
ought
also
to
love
one
another
but
if
you
can
not
feel
positive
affection
for
those
who
do
not
care
for
you
you
can
at
least
try
to
do
to
them
as
you
would
they
should
do
unto
you
you
can
endeavour
to
pity
their
failings
and
excuse
their
offences
and
to
do
all
the
good
you
can
to
those
about
you
and
if
you
accustom
yourself
to
this
nancy
the
very
effort
itself
will
make
you
love
them
in
some
say
nothing
of
the
goodwill
your
kindness
would
beget
in
them
though
they
might
have
little
else
that
is
good
about
them
if
we
love
god
and
wish
to
serve
him
let
us
try
to
be
like
him
to
do
his
work
to
labour
for
his
is
the
good
of
hasten
the
coming
of
his
kingdom
which
is
the
peace
and
happiness
of
all
the
world
however
powerless
we
may
seem
to
be
in
doing
all
the
good
we
can
through
life
the
humblest
of
us
may
do
much
towards
it
and
let
us
dwell
in
love
that
he
may
dwell
in
us
and
we
in
him
the
more
happiness
we
bestow
the
more
we
shall
receive
even
here
and
the
greater
will
be
our
reward
in
heaven
when
we
rest
from
our
i
believe
miss
them
is
his
very
words
for
i
ve
thought
em
ower
many
a
time
an
then
he
took
that
bible
an
read
bits
here
and
there
an
explained
em
as
clear
as
the
day
and
it
seemed
like
as
a
new
light
broke
in
on
my
soul
an
i
felt
fair
aglow
about
my
heart
an
only
wished
poor
bill
an
all
the
world
could
ha
been
there
an
heard
it
all
and
rejoiced
wi
me
after
he
was
gone
hannah
rogers
one
o
th
neighbours
came
in
and
wanted
me
to
help
her
to
wash
i
telled
her
i
couldn
t
just
then
for
i
hadn
t
set
on
th
potaties
for
th
dinner
nor
washed
up
th
breakfast
stuff
yet
so
then
she
began
me
for
my
nasty
idle
ways
i
was
a
little
bit
vexed
at
first
but
i
never
said
nothing
wrong
to
her
i
only
telled
her
like
all
in
a
quiet
way
at
i
d
had
th
new
parson
to
see
me
but
i
d
get
done
as
quick
as
ever
i
could
an
then
come
an
help
her
so
then
she
softened
down
and
my
heart
like
as
it
warmed
towards
her
an
in
a
bit
we
was
very
good
friends
an
so
it
is
miss
grey
a
soft
answer
turneth
away
wrath
but
grievous
words
stir
up
it
isn
t
only
in
them
you
speak
to
but
in
very
true
nancy

we
could
always
remember

do
and
they
take
it
kindly
of
me
just
as
he
said
you
see
miss
i
m
knitting
a
pair
o
stockings
now
re
for
thomas
jackson
he
s
a
queerish
old
body
an
we
ve
had
many
a
bout
at
threaping
one
anent
t
other
an
at
times
we
ve
differed
sorely
so
i
thought
i
couldn
t
do
better
nor
knit
him
a
pair
o
warm
stockings
an
i
ve
felt
to
like
him
a
deal
better
poor
old
man
sin
i
began
it
s
turned
out
just
as
maister
weston
well
i
m
very
glad
to
see
you
so
happy
nancy
and
so
wise
but
i
must
go
now
i
shall
be
wanted
at
the
hall
said
i
and
bidding
her
i
departed
promising
to
come
again
when
i
had
time
and
feeling
nearly
as
happy
as
herself
at
another
time
i
went
to
read
to
a
poor
labourer
who
was
in
the
last
stage
of
consumption
the
young
ladies
had
been
to
see
him
and
somehow
a
promise
of
reading
had
been
extracted
from
them
but
it
was
too
much
trouble
so
they
begged
me
to
do
it
instead
i
went
willingly
enough
and
there
too
i
was
gratified
with
the
praises
of
weston
both
from
the
sick
man
and
his
wife
the
former
told
me
that
he
derived
great
comfort
and
benefit
from
the
visits
of
the
new
parson
who
frequently
came
to
see
him
and
was
another
guess
sort
of
man
to
hatfield
who
before
the
other
s
arrival
at
horton
had
now
and
then
paid
him
a
visit
on
which
occasions
he
would
always
insist
upon
having
the
kept
open
to
admit
the
fresh
air
for
his
own
convenience
without
considering
how
it
might
injure
the
sufferer
and
having
opened
his
and
hastily
read
over
a
part
of
the
service
for
the
sick
would
hurry
away
again
if
he
did
not
stay
to
administer
some
harsh
rebuke
to
the
afflicted
wife
or
to
make
some
thoughtless
not
to
say
heartless
observation
rather
calculated
to
increase
than
diminish
the
troubles
of
the
suffering
pair
whereas
said
the
man
maister
weston
ull
pray
with
me
quite
in
a
different
fashion
an
talk
to
me
as
kind
as
owt
an
oft
read
to
me
too
an
sit
beside
me
just
like
a
just
for
all
the
world
exclaimed
his
wife
an
about
a
three
wik
sin
when
he
seed
how
poor
jem
shivered
wi
cold
an
what
pitiful
fires
we
kept
he
axed
if
wer
stock
of
coals
was
nearly
done
i
telled
him
it
was
an
we
was
ill
set
to
get
more
but
you
know
mum
i
didn
t
think
o
him
helping
us
but
howsever
he
sent
us
a
sack
o
coals
next
day
an
we
ve
had
good
fires
ever
sin
and
a
great
blessing
it
is
this
winter
time
but
that
s
his
way
miss
grey
when
he
comes
into
a
poor
body
s
house
sick
folk
he
like
notices
what
they
most
stand
i
need
on
an
if
he
thinks
they
can
t
readily
get
it
therseln
he
never
says
nowt
about
it
but
just
gets
it
for
em
an
it
isn
t
everybody
at
ud
do
that
at
has
as
little
as
he
has
for
you
know
mum
he
s
nowt
at
all
to
live
on
but
what
he
gets
fra
th
rector
an
that
s
little
enough
they
i
remembered
then
with
a
species
of
exultation
that
he
had
frequently
been
styled
a
vulgar
brute
by
the
amiable
miss
murray
because
he
wore
a
silver
watch
and
clothes
not
quite
so
bright
and
fresh
as
hatfield
s
in
returning
to
the
lodge
i
felt
very
happy
and
thanked
god
that
i
had
now
something
to
think
about
something
to
dwell
on
as
a
relief
from
the
weary
monotony
the
lonely
drudgery
of
my
present
life
for
i
lonely
never
from
month
to
month
from
year
to
year
except
during
my
brief
intervals
of
rest
at
home
did
i
see
one
creature
to
whom
i
could
open
my
heart
or
freely
speak
my
thoughts
with
any
hope
of
sympathy
or
even
comprehension
never
one
unless
it
were
poor
nancy
brown
with
whom
i
could
enjoy
a
single
moment
of
real
social
intercourse
or
whose
conversation
was
calculated
to
render
me
better
wiser
or
happier
than
before
or
who
as
far
as
i
could
see
could
be
greatly
benefited
by
mine
my
only
companions
had
been
unamiable
children
and
ignorant
girls
from
whose
fatiguing
folly
unbroken
solitude
was
often
a
relief
most
earnestly
desired
and
dearly
prized
but
to
be
restricted
to
such
associates
was
a
serious
evil
both
in
its
immediate
effects
and
the
consequences
that
were
likely
to
ensue
never
a
new
idea
or
stirring
thought
came
to
me
from
without
and
such
as
rose
within
me
were
for
the
most
part
miserably
crushed
at
once
or
doomed
to
sicken
or
fade
away
because
they
could
not
see
the
light
habitual
associates
are
known
to
exercise
a
great
influence
over
each
other
s
minds
and
manners
those
whose
actions
are
for
ever
before
our
eyes
whose
words
are
ever
in
our
ears
will
naturally
lead
us
albeit
against
our
will
slowly
gradually
imperceptibly
perhaps
to
act
and
speak
as
they
do
i
will
not
presume
to
say
how
far
this
irresistible
power
of
assimilation
extends
but
if
one
civilised
man
were
doomed
to
pass
a
dozen
years
amid
a
race
of
intractable
savages
unless
he
had
power
to
improve
them
i
greatly
question
whether
at
the
close
of
that
period
he
would
not
have
become
at
least
a
barbarian
himself
and
i
as
i
could
not
make
my
young
companions
better
feared
exceedingly
that
they
would
make
me
gradually
bring
my
feelings
habits
capacities
to
the
level
of
their
own
without
however
imparting
to
me
their
lightheartedness
and
cheerful
vivacity
already
i
seemed
to
feel
my
intellect
deteriorating
my
heart
petrifying
my
soul
contracting
and
i
trembled
lest
my
very
moral
perceptions
should
become
deadened
my
distinctions
of
right
and
wrong
confounded
and
all
my
better
faculties
be
sunk
at
last
beneath
the
baneful
influence
of
such
a
mode
of
life
the
gross
vapours
of
earth
were
gathering
around
me
and
closing
in
upon
my
inward
heaven
and
thus
it
was
that
weston
rose
at
length
upon
me
appearing
like
the
morning
star
in
my
horizon
to
save
me
from
the
fear
of
utter
darkness
and
i
rejoiced
that
i
had
now
a
subject
for
contemplation
that
was
above
me
not
beneath
i
was
glad
to
see
that
all
the
world
was
not
made
up
of
bloomfields
murrays
hatfields
ashbys
and
that
human
excellence
was
not
a
mere
dream
of
the
imagination
when
we
hear
a
little
good
and
no
harm
of
a
person
it
is
easy
and
pleasant
to
imagine
more
in
short
it
is
needless
to
analyse
all
my
thoughts
but
sunday
was
now
become
a
day
of
peculiar
delight
to
me
i
was
now
almost
to
the
back
corner
in
the
carriage
for
i
liked
to
hear
i
liked
to
see
him
too
though
i
knew
he
was
not
handsome
or
even
what
is
called
agreeable
in
outward
aspect
but
certainly
he
was
not
ugly
in
stature
he
was
a
little
a
very
little
above
the
middle
size
the
outline
of
his
face
would
be
pronounced
too
square
for
beauty
but
to
me
it
announced
decision
of
character
his
dark
brown
hair
was
not
carefully
curled
like
hatfield
s
but
simply
brushed
aside
over
a
broad
white
forehead
the
eyebrows
i
suppose
were
too
projecting
but
from
under
those
dark
brows
there
gleamed
an
eye
of
singular
power
brown
in
colour
not
large
and
somewhat
but
strikingly
brilliant
and
full
of
expression
there
was
character
too
in
the
mouth
something
that
bespoke
a
man
of
firm
purpose
and
an
habitual
thinker
and
when
he
i
will
not
speak
of
that
yet
for
at
the
time
i
mention
i
had
never
seen
him
smile
and
indeed
his
general
appearance
did
not
impress
me
with
the
idea
of
a
man
given
to
such
a
relaxation
nor
of
such
an
individual
as
the
cottagers
described
him
i
had
early
formed
my
opinion
of
him
and
in
spite
of
miss
murray
s
objurgations
was
fully
convinced
that
he
was
a
man
of
strong
sense
firm
faith
and
ardent
piety
but
thoughtful
and
stern
and
when
i
found
that
to
his
other
good
qualities
was
added
that
of
true
benevolence
and
gentle
considerate
kindness
the
discovery
perhaps
delighted
me
the
more
as
i
had
not
been
prepared
to
expect
it
chapter
shower
the
next
visit
i
paid
to
nancy
brown
was
in
the
second
week
in
march
for
though
i
had
many
spare
minutes
during
the
day
i
seldom
could
look
upon
an
hour
as
entirely
my
own
since
where
everything
was
left
to
the
caprices
of
miss
matilda
and
her
sister
there
could
be
no
order
or
regularity
whatever
occupation
i
chose
when
not
actually
busied
about
them
or
their
concerns
i
had
as
it
were
to
keep
my
loins
girded
my
shoes
on
my
feet
and
my
staff
in
my
hand
for
not
to
be
immediately
forthcoming
when
called
for
was
regarded
as
a
grave
and
inexcusable
offence
not
only
by
my
pupils
and
their
mother
but
by
the
very
servant
who
came
in
breathless
haste
to
call
me
exclaiming
you
re
to
go
to
the
schoolroom
mum
the
young
ladies
is
waiting
climax
of
horror
actually
waiting
for
their
governess
but
this
time
i
was
pretty
sure
of
an
hour
or
two
to
myself
for
matilda
was
preparing
for
a
long
ride
and
rosalie
was
dressing
for
a
at
lady
ashby
s
so
i
took
the
opportunity
of
repairing
to
the
widow
s
cottage
where
i
found
her
in
some
anxiety
about
her
cat
which
had
been
absent
all
day
i
comforted
her
with
as
many
anecdotes
of
that
animal
s
roving
propensities
as
i
could
recollect
i
m
feared
o
th
gamekeepers
said
she
that
s
all
at
i
think
on
if
th
young
gentlemen
had
been
at
home
i
should
a
thought
they
d
been
setting
their
dogs
at
her
an
worried
her
poor
thing
as
they
did
a
poor
thing
s
cat
but
i
haven
t
that
to
be
feared
on
nancy
s
eyes
were
better
but
still
far
from
well
she
had
been
trying
to
make
a
sunday
shirt
for
her
son
but
told
me
she
could
only
bear
to
do
a
little
bit
at
it
now
and
then
so
that
it
progressed
but
slowly
though
the
poor
lad
wanted
it
sadly
so
i
proposed
to
help
her
a
little
after
i
had
read
to
her
for
i
had
plenty
of
time
that
evening
and
need
not
return
till
dusk
she
thankfully
accepted
the
offer
an
you
ll
be
a
bit
o
company
for
me
too
miss
said
she
i
like
as
i
feel
lonesome
without
my
but
when
i
had
finished
reading
and
done
the
half
of
a
seam
with
nancy
s
capacious
brass
thimble
fitted
on
to
my
finger
by
means
of
a
roll
of
paper
i
was
disturbed
by
the
entrance
of
weston
with
the
identical
cat
in
his
arms
i
now
saw
that
he
could
smile
and
very
pleasantly
too
i
ve
done
you
a
piece
of
good
service
nancy
he
began
then
seeing
me
he
acknowledged
my
presence
by
a
slight
bow
i
should
have
been
invisible
to
hatfield
or
any
other
gentleman
of
those
parts
i
ve
delivered
your
cat
he
continued
from
the
hands
or
rather
the
gun
of
murray
s
god
bless
you
sir
cried
the
grateful
old
woman
ready
to
weep
for
joy
as
she
received
her
favourite
from
his
arms
take
care
of
it
said
he
and
don
t
let
it
go
near
the
for
the
gamekeeper
swears
he
ll
shoot
it
if
he
sees
it
there
again
he
would
have
done
so
if
i
had
not
been
in
time
to
stop
him
i
believe
it
is
raining
miss
grey
added
he
more
quietly
observing
that
i
had
put
aside
my
work
and
was
preparing
to
depart
don
t
let
me
disturb
shan
t
stay
two
you
ll
stay
while
this
shower
gets
owered
said
nancy
as
she
stirred
the
fire
and
placed
another
chair
beside
it
what
there
s
room
for
i
can
see
better
here
thank
you
nancy
replied
i
taking
my
work
to
the
window
where
she
had
the
goodness
to
suffer
me
to
remain
unmolested
while
she
got
a
brush
to
remove
the
cat
s
hairs
from
weston
s
coat
carefully
wiped
the
rain
from
his
hat
and
gave
the
cat
its
supper
busily
talking
all
the
time
now
thanking
her
clerical
friend
for
what
he
had
done
now
wondering
how
the
cat
had
found
out
the
warren
and
now
lamenting
the
probable
consequences
of
such
a
discovery
he
listened
with
a
quiet
smile
and
at
length
took
a
seat
in
compliance
with
her
pressing
invitations
but
repeated
that
he
did
not
mean
to
stay
i
have
another
place
to
go
to
said
he
and
i
see
glancing
at
the
book
on
the
table
someone
else
has
been
reading
to
yes
sir
miss
grey
has
been
as
kind
as
read
me
a
chapter
an
now
she
s
helping
me
with
a
shirt
for
our
i
m
feared
she
ll
be
cold
there
won
t
you
come
to
th
fire
miss
no
thank
you
nancy
i
m
quite
warm
i
must
go
as
soon
as
this
shower
is
oh
miss
you
said
you
could
stop
while
dusk
cried
the
provoking
old
woman
and
weston
seized
his
hat
nay
sir
exclaimed
she
pray
don
t
go
now
while
it
rains
so
but
it
strikes
me
i
m
keeping
your
visitor
away
from
the
no
you
re
not
weston
replied
i
hoping
there
was
no
harm
in
a
falsehood
of
that
description
no
sure
cried
nancy
what
there
s
lots
o
room
miss
grey
said
he
as
if
he
felt
it
necessary
to
change
the
present
subject
whether
he
had
anything
particular
to
say
or
not
i
wish
you
would
make
my
peace
with
the
squire
when
you
see
him
he
was
by
when
i
rescued
nancy
s
cat
and
did
not
quite
approve
of
the
deed
i
told
him
i
thought
he
might
better
spare
all
his
rabbits
than
she
her
cat
for
which
audacious
assertion
he
treated
me
to
some
rather
ungentlemanly
language
and
i
fear
i
retorted
a
trifle
too
oh
lawful
sir
i
hope
you
didn
t
fall
out
wi
th
maister
for
sake
o
my
cat
he
can
not
bide
answering
th
oh
it
s
no
matter
nancy
i
don
t
care
about
it
really
i
said
nothing
uncivil
and
i
suppose
murray
is
accustomed
to
use
rather
strong
language
when
he
s
ay
sir
it
s
a
and
now
i
really
must
go
i
have
to
visit
a
place
a
mile
beyond
this
and
you
would
not
have
me
to
return
in
the
dark
besides
it
has
nearly
done
raining
nancy
miss
weston
but
don
t
depend
upon
me
for
making
your
peace
with
murray
for
i
never
see
speak
don
t
you
it
can
t
be
helped
then
replied
he
in
dolorous
resignation
then
with
a
peculiar
he
added
but
never
mind
i
imagine
the
squire
has
more
to
apologise
for
than
i
and
left
the
cottage
i
went
on
with
my
sewing
as
long
as
i
could
see
and
then
bade
nancy
checking
her
too
lively
gratitude
by
the
undeniable
assurance
that
i
had
only
done
for
her
what
she
would
have
done
for
me
if
she
had
been
in
my
place
and
i
in
hers
i
hastened
back
to
horton
lodge
where
having
entered
the
schoolroom
i
found
the
all
in
confusion
the
tray
flooded
with
slops
and
miss
matilda
in
a
most
ferocious
humour
miss
grey
whatever
have
you
been
about
i
ve
had
tea
half
an
hour
ago
and
had
to
make
it
myself
and
drink
it
all
alone
i
wish
you
would
come
in
sooner
i
ve
been
to
see
nancy
brown
i
thought
you
would
not
be
back
from
your
how
could
i
ride
in
the
rain
i
should
like
to
know
that
damned
pelting
shower
was
vexatious
on
when
i
was
just
in
full
swing
and
then
to
come
and
find
nobody
in
to
tea
and
you
know
i
can
t
make
the
tea
as
i
like
i
didn
t
think
of
the
shower
replied
i
and
indeed
the
thought
of
its
driving
her
home
had
never
entered
my
head
no
of
course
you
were
under
shelter
yourself
and
you
never
thought
of
other
i
bore
her
coarse
reproaches
with
astonishing
equanimity
even
with
cheerfulness
for
i
was
sensible
that
i
had
done
more
good
to
nancy
brown
than
harm
to
her
and
perhaps
some
other
thoughts
assisted
to
keep
up
my
spirits
and
impart
a
relish
to
the
cup
of
cold
overdrawn
tea
and
a
charm
to
the
otherwise
unsightly
table
had
almost
miss
matilda
s
unamiable
face
but
she
soon
betook
herself
to
the
stables
and
left
me
to
the
quiet
enjoyment
of
my
solitary
meal
chapter
primroses
miss
murray
now
always
went
twice
to
church
for
she
so
loved
admiration
that
she
could
not
bear
to
lose
a
single
opportunity
of
obtaining
it
and
she
was
so
sure
of
it
wherever
she
showed
herself
that
whether
harry
meltham
and
green
were
there
or
not
there
was
certain
to
be
somebody
present
who
would
not
be
insensible
to
her
charms
besides
the
rector
whose
official
capacity
generally
obliged
him
to
attend
usually
also
if
the
weather
permitted
both
she
and
her
sister
would
walk
home
matilda
because
she
hated
the
confinement
of
the
carriage
she
because
she
disliked
the
privacy
of
it
and
enjoyed
the
company
that
generally
enlivened
the
first
mile
of
the
journey
in
walking
from
the
church
to
green
s
near
which
commenced
the
private
road
to
horton
lodge
which
lay
in
the
opposite
direction
while
the
highway
conducted
in
a
straightforward
course
to
the
still
more
distant
mansion
of
sir
hugh
meltham
thus
there
was
always
a
chance
of
being
accompanied
so
far
either
by
harry
meltham
with
or
without
miss
meltham
or
green
with
perhaps
one
or
both
of
his
sisters
and
any
gentlemen
visitors
they
might
have
whether
i
walked
with
the
young
ladies
or
rode
with
their
parents
depended
upon
their
own
capricious
will
if
they
chose
to
take
me
i
went
if
for
reasons
best
known
to
themselves
they
chose
to
go
alone
i
took
my
seat
in
the
carriage
i
liked
walking
better
but
a
sense
of
reluctance
to
obtrude
my
presence
on
anyone
who
did
not
desire
it
always
kept
me
passive
on
these
and
similar
occasions
and
i
never
inquired
into
the
causes
of
their
varying
whims
indeed
this
was
the
best
to
submit
and
oblige
was
the
governess
s
part
to
consult
their
own
pleasure
was
that
of
the
pupils
but
when
i
did
walk
the
first
half
of
journey
was
generally
a
great
nuisance
to
me
as
none
of
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
ever
noticed
me
it
was
disagreeable
to
walk
beside
them
as
if
listening
to
what
they
said
or
wishing
to
be
thought
one
of
them
while
they
talked
over
me
or
across
and
if
their
eyes
in
speaking
chanced
to
fall
on
me
it
seemed
as
if
they
looked
on
if
they
either
did
not
see
me
or
were
very
desirous
to
make
it
appear
so
it
was
disagreeable
too
to
walk
behind
and
thus
appear
to
acknowledge
my
own
inferiority
for
in
truth
i
considered
myself
pretty
nearly
as
good
as
the
best
of
them
and
wished
them
to
know
that
i
did
so
and
not
to
imagine
that
i
looked
upon
myself
as
a
mere
domestic
who
knew
her
own
place
too
well
to
walk
beside
such
fine
ladies
and
gentlemen
as
they
her
young
ladies
might
choose
to
have
her
with
them
and
even
condescend
to
converse
with
her
when
no
better
company
were
at
hand
am
almost
ashamed
to
confess
indeed
i
gave
myself
no
little
trouble
in
my
endeavours
if
i
did
keep
up
with
them
to
appear
perfectly
unconscious
or
regardless
of
their
presence
as
if
i
were
wholly
absorbed
in
my
own
reflections
or
the
contemplation
of
surrounding
objects
or
if
i
lingered
behind
it
was
some
bird
or
insect
some
tree
or
flower
that
attracted
my
attention
and
having
duly
examined
that
i
would
pursue
my
walk
alone
at
a
leisurely
pace
until
my
pupils
had
bidden
adieu
to
their
companions
and
turned
off
into
the
quiet
private
road
one
such
occasion
i
particularly
well
remember
it
was
a
lovely
afternoon
about
the
close
of
march
green
and
his
sisters
had
sent
their
carriage
back
empty
in
order
to
enjoy
the
bright
sunshine
and
balmy
air
in
a
sociable
walk
home
along
with
their
visitors
captain
somebody
and
lieutenant
a
couple
of
military
fops
and
the
misses
murray
who
of
course
contrived
to
join
them
such
a
party
was
highly
agreeable
to
rosalie
but
not
finding
it
equally
suitable
to
my
taste
i
presently
fell
back
and
began
to
botanise
and
entomologise
along
the
green
banks
and
budding
hedges
till
the
company
was
considerably
in
advance
of
me
and
i
could
hear
the
sweet
song
of
the
happy
lark
then
my
spirit
of
misanthropy
began
to
melt
away
beneath
the
soft
pure
air
and
genial
sunshine
but
sad
thoughts
of
early
childhood
and
yearnings
for
departed
joys
or
for
a
brighter
future
lot
arose
instead
as
my
eyes
wandered
over
the
steep
banks
covered
with
young
grass
and
plants
and
surmounted
by
budding
hedges
i
longed
intensely
for
some
familiar
flower
that
might
recall
the
woody
dales
or
green
of
home
the
brown
moorlands
of
course
were
out
of
the
question
such
a
discovery
would
make
my
eyes
gush
out
with
water
no
doubt
but
that
was
one
of
my
greatest
enjoyments
now
at
length
i
descried
high
up
between
the
twisted
roots
of
an
oak
three
lovely
primroses
peeping
so
sweetly
from
their
that
the
tears
already
started
at
the
sight
but
they
grew
so
high
above
me
that
i
tried
in
vain
to
gather
one
or
two
to
dream
over
and
to
carry
with
me
i
could
not
reach
them
unless
i
climbed
the
bank
which
i
was
deterred
from
doing
by
hearing
a
footstep
at
that
moment
behind
me
and
was
therefore
about
to
turn
away
when
i
was
startled
by
the
words
allow
me
to
gather
them
for
you
miss
grey
spoken
in
the
grave
low
tones
of
a
voice
immediately
the
flowers
were
gathered
and
in
my
hand
it
was
weston
of
else
would
trouble
himself
to
do
so
much
for
i
thanked
him
whether
warmly
or
coldly
i
can
not
tell
but
certain
i
am
that
i
did
not
express
half
the
gratitude
i
felt
it
was
foolish
perhaps
to
feel
any
gratitude
at
all
but
it
seemed
to
me
at
that
moment
as
if
this
were
a
remarkable
instance
of
his
an
act
of
kindness
which
i
could
not
repay
but
never
should
forget
so
utterly
unaccustomed
was
i
to
receive
such
civilities
so
little
prepared
to
expect
them
from
anyone
within
fifty
miles
of
horton
lodge
yet
this
did
not
prevent
me
from
feeling
a
little
uncomfortable
in
his
presence
and
i
proceeded
to
follow
my
pupils
at
a
much
quicker
pace
than
before
though
perhaps
if
weston
had
taken
the
hint
and
let
me
pass
without
another
word
i
might
have
repeated
it
an
hour
after
but
he
did
not
a
somewhat
rapid
walk
for
me
was
but
an
ordinary
pace
for
him
your
young
ladies
have
left
you
alone
said
he
yes
they
are
occupied
with
more
agreeable
then
don
t
trouble
yourself
to
overtake
i
slackened
my
pace
but
next
moment
regretted
having
done
so
my
companion
did
not
speak
and
i
had
nothing
in
the
world
to
say
and
feared
he
might
be
in
the
same
predicament
at
length
however
he
broke
the
pause
by
asking
with
a
certain
quiet
abruptness
peculiar
to
himself
if
i
liked
flowers
yes
very
much
i
answered
like
said
he
others
i
don
t
care
about
because
i
have
no
particular
associations
connected
with
one
or
two
what
are
your
favourite
flowers
primroses
bluebells
and
not
violets
no
because
as
you
say
i
have
no
particular
associations
connected
with
them
for
there
are
no
sweet
violets
among
the
hills
and
valleys
round
my
it
must
be
a
great
consolation
to
you
to
have
a
home
miss
grey
observed
my
companion
after
a
short
pause
however
remote
or
however
seldom
visited
still
it
is
something
to
look
it
is
so
much
that
i
think
i
could
not
live
without
it
replied
i
with
an
enthusiasm
of
which
i
immediately
repented
for
i
thought
it
must
have
sounded
essentially
silly
oh
yes
you
could
said
he
with
a
thoughtful
smile
the
ties
that
bind
us
to
life
are
tougher
than
you
imagine
or
than
anyone
can
who
has
not
felt
how
roughly
they
may
be
pulled
without
breaking
you
might
be
miserable
without
a
home
but
even
could
live
and
not
so
miserably
as
you
suppose
the
human
heart
is
like
a
little
swells
it
but
a
great
deal
will
not
burst
it
if
little
more
than
nothing
will
disturb
it
little
less
than
all
things
will
suffice
to
break
it
as
in
the
outer
members
of
our
frame
there
is
a
vital
power
inherent
in
itself
that
strengthens
it
against
external
violence
every
blow
that
shakes
it
will
serve
to
harden
it
against
a
future
stroke
as
constant
labour
thickens
the
skin
of
the
hand
and
strengthens
its
muscles
instead
of
wasting
them
away
so
that
a
day
of
arduous
toil
that
might
excoriate
a
lady
s
palm
would
make
no
sensible
impression
on
that
of
a
hardy
ploughman
i
speak
from
my
own
there
was
a
time
when
i
thought
as
you
least
i
was
fully
persuaded
that
home
and
its
affections
were
the
only
things
that
made
life
tolerable
that
if
deprived
of
these
existence
would
become
a
burden
hard
to
be
endured
but
now
i
have
no
you
would
dignify
my
two
hired
rooms
at
horton
by
such
a
name
not
twelve
months
ago
i
lost
the
last
and
dearest
of
my
early
friends
and
yet
not
only
i
live
but
i
am
not
wholly
destitute
of
hope
and
comfort
even
for
this
life
though
i
must
acknowledge
that
i
can
seldom
enter
even
an
humble
cottage
at
the
close
of
day
and
see
its
inhabitants
peaceably
gathered
around
their
cheerful
hearth
without
a
feeling
of
envy
at
their
domestic
you
don
t
know
what
happiness
lies
before
you
yet
said
i
you
are
now
only
in
the
commencement
of
your
the
best
of
happiness
replied
he
is
mine
power
and
the
will
to
be
we
now
approached
a
stile
communicating
with
a
footpath
that
conducted
to
a
where
i
suppose
weston
purposed
to
make
himself
useful
for
he
presently
took
leave
of
me
crossed
the
stile
and
traversed
the
path
with
his
usual
firm
elastic
tread
leaving
me
to
ponder
his
words
as
i
continued
my
course
alone
i
had
heard
before
that
he
had
lost
his
mother
not
many
months
before
he
came
she
then
was
the
last
and
dearest
of
his
early
friends
and
he
had
i
pitied
him
from
my
heart
i
almost
wept
for
sympathy
and
this
i
thought
accounted
for
the
shade
of
premature
thoughtfulness
that
so
frequently
clouded
his
brow
and
obtained
for
him
the
reputation
of
a
morose
and
sullen
disposition
with
the
charitable
miss
murray
and
all
her
kin
but
thought
i
he
is
not
so
miserable
as
i
should
be
under
such
a
deprivation
he
leads
an
active
life
and
a
wide
field
for
useful
exertion
lies
before
him
he
can
friends
and
he
can
make
a
home
too
if
he
pleases
and
doubtless
he
will
please
some
time
god
grant
the
partner
of
that
home
may
be
worthy
of
his
choice
and
make
it
a
happy
a
home
as
he
deserves
to
have
and
how
delightful
it
would
be
but
no
matter
what
i
thought
i
began
this
book
with
the
intention
of
concealing
nothing
that
those
who
liked
might
have
the
benefit
of
perusing
a
s
heart
but
we
have
some
thoughts
that
all
the
angels
in
heaven
are
welcome
to
behold
but
not
our
even
the
best
and
kindest
amongst
them
by
this
time
the
greens
had
taken
themselves
to
their
own
abode
and
the
murrays
had
turned
down
the
private
road
whither
i
hastened
to
follow
them
i
found
the
two
girls
warm
in
an
animated
discussion
on
the
respective
merits
of
the
two
young
officers
but
on
seeing
me
rosalie
broke
off
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
to
exclaim
with
malicious
miss
grey
you
re
come
at
last
are
you
no
you
lingered
so
long
behind
and
no
you
always
stand
up
so
vigorously
for
weston
when
i
abuse
him
i
see
it
all
now
now
come
miss
murray
don
t
be
foolish
said
i
attempting
a
laugh
you
know
such
nonsense
can
make
no
impression
on
but
she
still
went
on
talking
such
intolerable
sister
helping
her
with
appropriate
fiction
coined
for
the
i
thought
it
necessary
to
say
something
in
my
own
justification
what
folly
all
this
is
i
exclaimed
if
weston
s
road
happened
to
be
the
same
as
mine
for
a
few
yards
and
if
he
chose
to
exchange
a
word
or
two
in
passing
what
is
there
so
remarkable
in
that
i
assure
you
i
never
spoke
to
him
before
except
where
where
and
when
cried
they
eagerly
in
nancy
s
you
ve
met
him
there
have
you
exclaimed
rosalie
with
exultant
laughter
ah
now
matilda
i
ve
found
out
why
she
s
so
fond
of
going
to
nancy
brown
s
she
goes
there
to
flirt
with
really
that
is
not
worth
only
saw
him
there
once
i
tell
how
could
i
know
he
was
coming
irritated
as
i
was
at
their
foolish
mirth
and
vexatious
imputations
the
uneasiness
did
not
continue
long
when
they
had
had
their
laugh
out
they
returned
again
to
the
captain
and
lieutenant
and
while
they
disputed
and
commented
upon
them
my
indignation
rapidly
cooled
the
cause
of
it
was
quickly
forgotten
and
i
turned
my
thoughts
into
a
pleasanter
channel
thus
we
proceeded
up
the
park
and
entered
the
hall
and
as
i
ascended
the
stairs
to
my
own
chamber
i
had
but
one
thought
within
me
my
heart
was
filled
to
overflowing
with
one
single
earnest
wish
having
entered
the
room
and
shut
the
door
i
fell
upon
my
knees
and
offered
up
a
fervent
but
not
impetuous
prayer
thy
will
be
done
i
strove
to
say
throughout
but
father
all
things
are
possible
with
thee
and
may
it
be
thy
will
was
sure
to
follow
that
men
and
women
would
have
scorned
me
but
father
wilt
despise
i
said
and
felt
that
it
was
true
it
seemed
to
me
that
another
s
welfare
was
at
least
as
ardently
implored
for
as
my
own
nay
even
was
the
principal
object
of
my
heart
s
desire
i
might
have
been
deceiving
myself
but
that
idea
gave
me
confidence
to
ask
and
power
to
hope
i
did
not
ask
in
vain
as
for
the
primroses
i
kept
two
of
them
in
a
glass
in
my
room
until
they
were
completely
withered
and
the
housemaid
threw
them
out
and
the
petals
of
the
other
i
pressed
between
the
leaves
of
my
have
them
still
and
mean
to
keep
them
always

rector
the
following
day
was
as
fine
as
the
preceding
one
soon
after
breakfast
miss
matilda
having
galloped
and
blundered
through
a
few
unprofitable
lessons
and
vengeably
thumped
the
piano
for
an
hour
in
a
terrible
humour
with
both
me
and
it
because
her
mamma
would
not
give
her
a
holiday
had
betaken
herself
to
her
favourite
places
of
resort

yards
the
stables

was
gone
forth
to
enjoy
a
quiet
ramble
with
a
new
fashionable
novel
for
her
companion
leaving
me
in
the
schoolroom
hard
at
work
upon
a
drawing
which
i
had
promised
to
do
for
her
and
which
she
insisted
upon
my
finishing
that
day
at
my
feet
lay
a
little
rough
terrier
it
was
the
property
of
miss
matilda
but
she
hated
the
animal
and
intended
to
sell
it
alleging
that
it
was
quite
spoiled
it
was
really
an
excellent
dog
of
its
kind
but
she
affirmed
it
was
fit
for
nothing
and
had
not
even
the
sense
to
know
its
own
mistress
the
fact
was
she
had
purchased
it
when
but
a
small
puppy
insisting
at
first
that
no
one
should
touch
it
but
herself
but
soon
becoming
tired
of
so
helpless
and
troublesome
a
nursling
she
had
gladly
yielded
to
my
entreaties
to
be
allowed
to
take
charge
of
it
and
i
by
carefully
nursing
the
little
creature
from
infancy
to
adolescence
of
course
had
obtained
its
affections
a
reward
i
should
have
greatly
valued
and
looked
upon
as
far
outweighing
all
the
trouble
i
had
had
with
it
had
not
poor
snap
s
grateful
feelings
exposed
him
to
many
a
harsh
word
and
many
a
spiteful
kick
and
pinch
from
his
owner
and
were
he
not
now
in
danger
of
being
put
away
in
consequence
or
transferred
to
some
rough
master
but
how
could
i
help
it
i
could
not
make
the
dog
hate
me
by
cruel
treatment
and
she
would
not
propitiate
him
by
kindness
however
while
i
thus
sat
working
away
with
my
pencil
murray
came
into
the
room
miss
grey
she
began
dear
how
can
you
sit
at
your
drawing
such
a
day
as
this
she
thought
i
was
doing
it
for
my
own
pleasure
i
you
don
t
put
on
your
bonnet
and
go
out
with
the
young
i
think
ma
am
miss
murray
is
reading
and
miss
matilda
is
amusing
herself
with
her
if
you
would
try
to
amuse
miss
matilda
yourself
a
little
more
i
think
she
would
not
be
driven
to
seek
amusement
in
the
companionship
of
dogs
and
horses
and
grooms
so
much
as
she
is
and
if
you
would
be
a
little
more
cheerful
and
conversable
with
miss
murray
she
would
not
so
often
go
wandering
in
the
fields
with
a
book
in
her
hand
however
i
don
t
want
to
vex
you
added
she
seeing
i
suppose
that
my
cheeks
burned
and
my
hand
trembled
with
some
unamiable
emotion
do
pray
try
not
to
be
so
s
no
speaking
to
you
else
and
tell
me
if
you
know
where
rosalie
is
gone
and
why
she
likes
to
be
so
much
alone
she
says
she
likes
to
be
alone
when
she
has
a
new
book
to
but
why
can
t
she
read
it
in
the
park
or
the
garden
should
she
go
into
the
fields
and
lanes
and
how
is
it
that
that
hatfield
so
often
finds
her
out
she
told
me
last
week
he
d
walked
his
horse
by
her
side
all
up
moss
lane
and
now
i
m
sure
it
was
he
i
saw
from
my
window
walking
so
briskly
past
the
and
on
towards
the
field
where
she
so
frequently
goes
i
wish
you
would
go
and
see
if
she
is
there
and
just
gently
remind
her
that
it
is
not
proper
for
a
young
lady
of
her
rank
and
prospects
to
be
wandering
about
by
herself
in
that
manner
exposed
to
the
attentions
of
anyone
that
presumes
to
address
her
like
some
poor
neglected
girl
that
has
no
park
to
walk
in
and
no
friends
to
take
care
of
her
and
tell
her
that
her
papa
would
be
extremely
angry
if
he
knew
of
her
treating
hatfield
in
the
familiar
manner
that
i
fear
she
does
if
governess
had
but
half
a
mother
s
a
mother
s
anxious
care
i
should
be
saved
this
trouble
and
you
would
see
at
once
the
necessity
of
keeping
your
eye
upon
her
and
making
your
company
agreeable
well
there
s
no
time
to
be
lost
cried
she
seeing
that
i
had
put
away
my
drawing
materials
and
was
waiting
in
the
doorway
for
the
conclusion
of
her
address
according
to
her
prognostications
i
found
miss
murray
in
her
favourite
field
just
without
the
park
and
unfortunately
not
alone
for
the
tall
stately
figure
of
hatfield
was
slowly
sauntering
by
her
side
here
was
a
poser
for
me
it
was
my
duty
to
interrupt
the
but
how
was
it
to
be
done
hatfield
could
not
to
be
driven
away
by
so
insignificant
person
as
i
and
to
go
and
place
myself
on
the
other
side
of
miss
murray
and
intrude
my
unwelcome
presence
upon
her
without
noticing
her
companion
was
a
piece
of
rudeness
i
could
not
be
guilty
of
neither
had
i
the
courage
to
cry
aloud
from
the
top
of
the
field
that
she
was
wanted
elsewhere
so
i
took
the
intermediate
course
of
walking
slowly
but
steadily
towards
them
resolving
if
my
approach
failed
to
scare
away
the
beau
to
pass
by
and
tell
miss
murray
her
mamma
wanted
her
she
certainly
looked
very
charming
as
she
strolled
lingering
along
under
the
budding
trees
that
stretched
their
long
arms
over
the
with
her
closed
book
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
graceful
sprig
of
myrtle
which
served
her
as
a
very
pretty
plaything
her
bright
ringlets
escaping
profusely
from
her
little
bonnet
and
gently
stirred
by
the
breeze
her
fair
cheek
flushed
with
gratified
vanity
her
smiling
blue
eyes
now
slyly
glancing
towards
her
admirer
now
gazing
downward
at
her
myrtle
sprig
but
snap
running
before
me
interrupted
her
in
the
midst
of
some
repartee
by
catching
hold
of
her
dress
and
vehemently
tugging
thereat
till
hatfield
with
his
cane
administered
a
resounding
thwack
upon
the
animal
s
skull
and
sent
it
yelping
back
to
me
with
a
clamorous
outcry
that
afforded
the
reverend
gentleman
great
amusement
but
seeing
me
so
near
he
thought
i
suppose
he
might
as
well
be
taking
his
departure
and
as
i
stooped
to
caress
the
dog
with
ostentatious
pity
to
show
my
disapproval
of
his
severity
i
heard
him
say
when
shall
i
see
you
again
miss
murray
at
church
i
suppose
replied
she
unless
your
business
chances
to
bring
you
here
again
at
the
precise
moment
when
i
happen
to
be
walking
i
could
always
manage
to
have
business
here
if
i
knew
precisely
when
and
where
to
find
but
if
i
would
i
could
not
inform
you
for
i
am
so
immethodical
i
never
can
tell
what
i
shall
do
then
give
me
that
meantime
to
comfort
me
said
he
half
jestingly
and
half
in
earnest
extending
his
hand
for
the
sprig
of
myrtle
no
indeed
i
shan
do
do
i
shall
be
the
most
miserable
of
men
if
you
don
t
you
can
not
be
so
cruel
as
to
deny
me
a
favour
so
easily
granted
and
yet
so
highly
prized
pleaded
he
as
ardently
as
if
his
life
depended
on
it
by
this
time
i
stood
within
a
very
few
yards
of
them
impatiently
waiting
his
departure
there
then
take
it
and
go
said
rosalie
he
joyfully
received
the
gift
murmured
something
that
made
her
blush
and
toss
her
head
but
with
a
little
laugh
that
showed
her
displeasure
was
entirely
affected
and
then
with
a
courteous
salutation
withdrew
did
you
ever
see
such
a
man
miss
grey
said
she
turning
to
me
i
m
so
you
came
i
thought
i
never
get
rid
of
him
and
i
was
so
terribly
afraid
of
papa
seeing
has
he
been
with
you
long
no
not
long
but
he
s
so
extremely
impertinent
and
he
s
always
hanging
about
pretending
his
business
or
his
clerical
duties
require
his
attendance
in
these
parts
and
really
watching
for
poor
me
and
pouncing
upon
me
wherever
he
sees
well
your
mamma
thinks
you
ought
not
to
go
beyond
the
park
or
garden
without
some
discreet
matronly
person
like
me
to
accompany
you
and
keep
off
all
intruders
she
descried
hatfield
hurrying
past
the
and
forthwith
despatched
me
with
instructions
to
seek
you
up
and
to
take
care
of
you
and
likewise
to
oh
mamma
s
so
tiresome
as
if
i
couldn
t
take
care
of
myself
she
bothered
me
before
about
hatfield
and
i
told
her
she
might
trust
me
i
never
should
forget
my
rank
and
station
for
the
most
delightful
man
that
ever
breathed
i
wish
he
would
go
down
on
his
knees
and
implore
me
to
be
his
wife
that
i
might
just
show
her
how
mistaken
she
is
in
supposing
that
i
could
it
provokes
me
so
to
think
that
i
could
be
such
a
fool
as
to
fall
in
it
is
quite
beneath
the
dignity
of
a
woman
to
do
such
a
thing
love
i
detest
the
word
as
applied
to
one
of
our
sex
i
think
it
a
perfect
insult
a
preference
i
acknowledge
but
never
for
one
like
poor
hatfield
who
has
not
seven
hundred
a
year
to
bless
himself
with
i
like
to
talk
to
him
because
he
s
so
clever
and
wish
sir
thomas
ashby
were
half
as
nice
besides
i
must
have
to
flirt
with
and
no
one
else
has
the
sense
to
come
here
and
when
we
go
out
mamma
won
t
let
me
flirt
with
anybody
but
sir
he
s
there
and
if
he
s
there
i
m
bound
hand
and
foot
for
fear
somebody
should
go
and
make
up
some
exaggerated
story
and
put
it
into
his
head
that
i
m
engaged
or
likely
to
be
engaged
to
somebody
else
or
what
is
more
probable
for
fear
his
nasty
old
mother
should
see
or
hear
of
my
ongoings
and
conclude
that
i
m
not
a
fit
wife
for
her
excellent
son
as
if
the
said
son
were
not
the
greatest
scamp
in
christendom
and
as
if
any
woman
of
common
decency
were
not
a
world
too
good
for
is
it
really
so
miss
murray
and
does
your
mamma
know
it
and
yet
wish
you
to
marry
him
to
be
sure
she
does
she
knows
more
against
him
than
i
do
i
believe
she
keeps
it
from
me
lest
i
should
be
discouraged
not
knowing
how
little
i
care
about
such
things
for
it
s
no
great
matter
really
he
ll
be
all
right
when
he
s
married
as
mamma
says
and
reformed
rakes
make
the
best
husbands
knows
i
only
wish
he
were
not
so
all
think
about
but
then
there
s
no
choice
here
in
the
country
and
papa
let
us
go
to
but
i
should
think
hatfield
would
be
far
and
so
he
would
if
he
were
lord
of
ashby
s
not
a
doubt
of
it
but
the
fact
is
i
have
ashby
park
whoever
shares
it
with
but
hatfield
thinks
you
like
him
all
this
time
you
don
t
consider
how
bitterly
he
will
be
disappointed
when
he
finds
himself
indeed
it
will
be
a
proper
punishment
for
his
ever
to
think
i
could
like
him
i
should
enjoy
nothing
so
much
as
lifting
the
veil
from
his
the
sooner
you
do
it
the
better
no
i
tell
you
i
like
to
amuse
myself
with
him
besides
he
doesn
t
really
think
i
like
him
i
take
good
care
of
that
you
don
t
know
how
cleverly
i
manage
he
may
presume
to
think
he
can
induce
me
to
like
him
for
which
i
shall
punish
him
as
he
well
mind
you
don
t
give
too
much
reason
for
such
s
all
replied
i
but
all
my
exhortations
were
in
vain
they
only
made
her
somewhat
more
solicitous
to
disguise
her
wishes
and
her
thoughts
from
me
she
talked
no
more
to
me
about
the
rector
but
i
could
see
that
her
mind
if
not
her
heart
was
fixed
upon
him
still
and
that
she
was
intent
upon
obtaining
another
interview
for
though
in
compliance
with
her
mother
s
request
i
was
now
constituted
the
companion
of
her
rambles
for
a
time
she
still
persisted
in
wandering
in
the
fields
and
lanes
that
lay
in
the
nearest
proximity
to
the
road
and
whether
she
talked
to
me
or
read
the
book
she
carried
in
her
hand
she
kept
continually
pausing
to
look
round
her
or
gaze
up
the
road
to
see
if
anyone
was
coming
and
if
a
horseman
trotted
by
i
could
tell
by
her
unqualified
abuse
of
the
poor
equestrian
whoever
he
might
be
that
she
hated
him
he
was
not
hatfield
surely
thought
i
she
is
not
so
indifferent
to
him
as
she
believes
herself
to
be
or
would
have
others
to
believe
her
and
her
mother
s
anxiety
is
not
so
wholly
causeless
as
she
three
days
passed
away
and
he
did
not
make
his
appearance
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
as
we
were
walking
beside
the
in
the
memorable
field
each
furnished
with
a
book
for
i
always
took
care
to
provide
myself
with
something
to
be
doing
when
she
did
not
require
me
to
talk
she
suddenly
interrupted
my
studies
by
oh
miss
grey
do
be
so
kind
as
to
go
and
see
mark
wood
and
take
his
wife
from
should
have
given
or
sent
it
a
week
ago
but
quite
forgot
there
said
she
throwing
me
her
purse
and
speaking
very
never
mind
getting
it
out
now
but
take
the
purse
and
give
them
what
you
like
i
would
go
with
you
but
i
want
to
finish
this
volume
i
ll
come
and
meet
you
when
i
ve
done
it
be
quick
will
wait
hadn
t
you
better
read
to
him
a
bit
run
to
the
house
and
get
some
sort
of
a
good
book
anything
will
i
did
as
i
was
desired
but
suspecting
something
from
her
hurried
manner
and
the
suddenness
of
the
request
i
just
glanced
back
before
i
quitted
the
field
and
there
was
hatfield
about
to
enter
at
the
gate
below
by
sending
me
to
the
house
for
a
book
she
had
just
prevented
my
meeting
him
on
the
road
never
mind
thought
i
there
ll
be
no
great
harm
done
poor
mark
will
be
glad
of
the
and
perhaps
of
the
good
book
too
and
if
the
rector
does
steal
miss
rosalie
s
heart
it
will
only
humble
her
pride
a
little
and
if
they
do
get
married
at
last
it
will
only
save
her
from
a
worse
fate
and
she
will
be
quite
a
good
enough
partner
for
him
and
he
for
mark
wood
was
the
consumptive
labourer
whom
i
mentioned
before
he
was
now
rapidly
wearing
away
miss
murray
by
her
liberality
obtained
literally
the
blessing
of
him
that
was
ready
to
perish
for
though
the
could
be
of
very
little
service
to
him
he
was
glad
of
it
for
the
sake
of
his
wife
and
children
so
soon
to
be
widowed
and
fatherless
after
i
had
sat
a
few
minutes
and
read
a
little
for
the
comfort
and
edification
of
himself
and
his
afflicted
wife
i
left
them
but
i
had
not
proceeded
fifty
yards
before
i
encountered
weston
apparently
on
his
way
to
the
same
abode
he
greeted
me
in
his
usual
quiet
unaffected
way
stopped
to
inquire
about
the
condition
of
the
sick
man
and
his
family
and
with
a
sort
of
unconscious
brotherly
disregard
to
ceremony
took
from
my
hand
the
book
out
of
which
i
had
been
reading
turned
over
its
pages
made
a
few
brief
but
very
sensible
remarks
and
restored
it
then
told
me
about
some
poor
sufferer
he
had
just
been
visiting
talked
a
little
about
nancy
brown
made
a
few
observations
upon
my
little
rough
friend
the
terrier
that
was
frisking
at
his
feet
and
finally
upon
the
beauty
of
the
weather
and
departed
i
have
omitted
to
give
a
detail
of
his
words
from
a
notion
that
they
would
not
interest
the
reader
as
they
did
me
and
not
because
i
have
forgotten
them
no
i
remember
them
well
for
i
thought
them
over
and
over
again
in
the
course
of
that
day
and
many
succeeding
ones
i
know
not
how
often
and
recalled
every
intonation
of
his
deep
clear
voice
every
flash
of
his
quick
brown
eye
and
every
gleam
of
his
pleasant
but
too
transient
smile
such
a
confession
will
look
very
absurd
i
fear
but
no
matter
i
have
written
it
and
they
that
read
it
will
not
know
the
writer
while
i
was
walking
along
happy
within
and
pleased
with
all
around
miss
murray
came
hastening
to
meet
me
her
buoyant
step
flushed
cheek
and
radiant
smiles
showing
that
she
too
was
happy
in
her
own
way
running
up
to
me
she
put
her
arm
through
mine
and
without
waiting
to
recover
breath
now
miss
grey
think
yourself
highly
honoured
for
i
m
come
to
tell
you
my
news
before
i
ve
breathed
a
word
of
it
to
anyone
well
what
is
it
oh
news
in
the
first
place
you
must
know
that
hatfield
came
upon
me
just
after
you
were
gone
i
was
in
such
a
way
for
fear
papa
or
mamma
should
see
him
but
you
know
i
couldn
t
call
you
back
again
and
so
dear
i
can
t
tell
you
all
about
it
now
for
there
s
matilda
i
see
in
the
park
and
i
must
go
and
open
my
budget
to
her
but
however
hatfield
was
most
uncommonly
audacious
unspeakably
complimentary
and
unprecedentedly
to
be
so
at
didn
t
succeed
very
well
in
because
it
s
not
his
vein
i
ll
tell
you
all
he
said
another
but
what
did
m
more
interested
in
that
i
ll
tell
you
that
too
at
some
future
period
i
happened
to
be
in
a
very
good
humour
just
then
but
though
i
was
complaisant
and
gracious
enough
i
took
care
not
to
compromise
myself
in
any
possible
way
but
however
the
conceited
wretch
chose
to
interpret
my
amiability
of
temper
his
own
way
and
at
length
presumed
upon
my
indulgence
so
do
you
think
actually
made
me
an
offer
and
i
proudly
drew
myself
up
and
with
the
greatest
coolness
expressed
my
astonishment
at
such
an
occurrence
and
hoped
he
had
seen
nothing
in
my
conduct
to
justify
his
expectations
you
should
have
how
his
countenance
fell
he
went
perfectly
white
in
the
face
i
assured
him
that
i
esteemed
him
and
all
that
but
could
not
possibly
accede
to
his
proposals
and
if
i
did
papa
and
mamma
could
never
be
brought
to
give
their
but
if
they
could
said
he
would
yours
be
wanting
certainly
hatfield
i
replied
with
a
cool
decision
which
quelled
all
hope
at
once
oh
if
you
had
seen
how
dreadfully
mortified
he
crushed
to
the
earth
by
his
disappointment
really
i
almost
pitied
him
myself
one
more
desperate
attempt
however
he
made
after
a
silence
of
considerable
duration
during
which
he
struggled
to
be
calm
and
i
to
be
i
felt
a
strong
propensity
to
would
have
ruined
said
with
the
ghost
of
a
but
tell
me
plainly
miss
murray
if
i
had
the
wealth
of
sir
hugh
meltham
or
the
prospects
of
his
eldest
son
would
you
still
refuse
me
answer
me
truly
upon
your
certainly
said
i
that
would
make
no
difference
it
was
a
great
lie
but
he
looked
so
confident
in
his
own
attractions
still
that
i
determined
not
to
leave
him
one
stone
upon
another
he
looked
me
full
in
the
face
but
i
kept
my
countenance
so
well
that
he
could
not
imagine
i
was
saying
anything
more
than
the
actual
truth
then
it
s
all
over
i
suppose
he
said
looking
as
if
he
could
have
died
on
the
spot
with
vexation
and
the
intensity
of
his
despair
but
he
was
angry
as
well
as
disappointed
there
was
he
suffering
so
unspeakably
and
there
was
i
the
pitiless
cause
of
it
all
so
utterly
impenetrable
to
all
the
artillery
of
his
looks
and
words
so
calmly
cold
and
proud
he
could
not
but
feel
some
resentment
and
with
singular
bitterness
he
i
certainly
did
not
expect
this
miss
murray
i
might
say
something
about
your
past
conduct
and
the
hopes
you
have
led
me
to
foster
but
i
forbear
on
no
conditions
hatfield
said
i
now
truly
indignant
at
his
insolence
then
let
me
beg
it
as
a
favour
he
replied
lowering
his
voice
at
once
and
taking
a
humbler
tone
let
me
entreat
that
you
will
not
mention
this
affair
to
anyone
whatever
if
you
will
keep
silence
about
it
there
need
be
no
unpleasantness
on
either
i
mean
beyond
what
is
quite
unavoidable
for
my
own
feelings
i
will
endeavour
to
keep
to
myself
if
i
can
not
annihilate
will
try
to
forgive
if
i
can
not
forget
the
cause
of
my
sufferings
i
will
not
suppose
miss
murray
that
you
know
how
deeply
you
have
injured
me
i
would
not
have
you
aware
of
it
but
if
in
addition
to
the
injury
you
have
already
done
me
but
whether
innocently
or
not
you
done
if
you
add
to
it
by
giving
publicity
to
this
unfortunate
affair
or
naming
it
you
will
find
that
i
too
can
speak
and
though
you
scorned
my
love
you
will
hardly
scorn
he
stopped
but
he
bit
his
bloodless
lip
and
looked
so
terribly
fierce
that
i
was
quite
frightened
however
my
pride
upheld
me
still
and
i
answered
disdainfully
i
do
not
know
what
motive
you
suppose
i
could
have
for
naming
it
to
anyone
hatfield
but
if
i
were
disposed
to
do
so
you
would
not
deter
me
by
threats
and
it
is
scarcely
the
part
of
a
gentleman
to
attempt
pardon
me
miss
murray
said
he
i
have
loved
you
so
do
still
adore
you
so
deeply
that
i
would
not
willingly
offend
you
but
though
i
never
have
loved
and
never
love
any
woman
as
i
have
loved
you
it
is
equally
certain
that
i
never
was
so
by
any
on
the
contrary
i
have
always
found
your
sex
the
kindest
and
most
tender
and
obliging
of
god
s
creation
till
think
of
the
conceited
fellow
saying
that
and
the
novelty
and
harshness
of
the
lesson
you
have
taught
me
and
the
bitterness
of
being
disappointed
in
the
only
quarter
on
which
the
happiness
of
my
life
depended
must
excuse
any
appearance
of
asperity
if
my
presence
is
disagreeable
to
you
miss
murray
he
said
for
i
was
looking
about
me
to
show
how
little
i
cared
for
him
so
he
thought
i
was
tired
of
him
i
suppose
if
my
presence
is
disagreeable
to
you
miss
murray
you
have
only
to
promise
me
the
favour
i
named
and
i
will
relieve
you
at
once
there
are
many
even
in
this
would
be
delighted
to
accept
what
you
have
so
scornfully
trampled
under
your
feet
they
would
be
naturally
inclined
to
hate
one
whose
surpassing
loveliness
has
so
completely
estranged
my
heart
from
them
and
blinded
me
to
their
attractions
and
a
single
hint
of
the
truth
from
me
to
one
of
these
would
be
sufficient
to
raise
such
a
talk
against
you
as
would
seriously
injure
your
prospects
and
diminish
your
chance
of
success
with
any
other
gentleman
you
or
your
mamma
might
design
to
what
do
your
mean
sir
said
i
ready
to
stamp
with
passion
i
mean
that
this
affair
from
beginning
to
end
appears
to
me
like
a
case
of
arrant
flirtation
to
say
the
least
of
a
case
as
you
would
find
it
rather
inconvenient
to
have
blazoned
through
the
world
especially
with
the
additions
and
exaggerations
of
your
female
rivals
who
would
be
too
glad
to
publish
the
matter
if
i
only
gave
them
a
handle
to
it
but
i
promise
you
on
the
faith
of
a
gentleman
that
no
word
or
syllable
that
could
tend
to
your
prejudice
shall
ever
escape
my
lips
provided
you
well
well
i
won
t
mention
it
said
i
you
may
rely
upon
my
silence
if
that
can
afford
you
any
you
promise
it
yes
i
answered
for
i
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
now
farewell
then
said
he
in
a
most
doleful
tone
and
with
a
look
where
pride
vainly
struggled
against
despair
he
turned
and
went
away
longing
no
doubt
to
get
home
that
he
might
shut
himself
up
in
his
study
and
he
doesn
t
burst
into
tears
before
he
gets
but
you
have
broken
your
promise
already
said
i
truly
horrified
at
her
perfidy
oh
it
s
only
to
you
i
know
you
won
t
repeat
certainly
i
shall
not
but
you
say
you
are
going
to
tell
your
sister
and
she
will
tell
your
brothers
when
they
come
home
and
brown
immediately
if
you
do
not
tell
her
yourself
and
brown
will
blazon
it
or
be
the
means
of
blazoning
it
throughout
the
no
indeed
she
won
t
we
shall
not
tell
her
at
all
unless
it
be
under
the
promise
of
the
strictest
but
how
can
you
expect
her
to
keep
her
promises
better
than
her
more
enlightened
mistress
well
well
she
shan
t
hear
it
then
said
miss
murray
somewhat
snappishly
but
you
will
tell
your
mamma
of
course
pursued
i
and
she
will
tell
your
of
course
i
shall
tell
is
the
very
thing
that
pleases
me
so
much
i
shall
now
be
able
to
convince
her
how
mistaken
she
was
in
her
fears
about
oh
it
is
it
i
was
wondering
what
it
was
that
delighted
you
so
yes
and
another
thing
is
that
i
ve
humbled
hatfield
so
charmingly
and
you
must
allow
me
some
share
of
female
vanity
i
don
t
pretend
to
be
without
that
most
essential
attribute
of
our
if
you
had
seen
poor
hatfield
s
intense
eagerness
in
making
his
ardent
declaration
and
his
flattering
proposal
and
his
agony
of
mind
that
no
effort
of
pride
could
conceal
on
being
refused
you
would
have
allowed
i
had
some
cause
to
be
the
greater
his
agony
i
should
think
the
less
your
cause
for
oh
nonsense
cried
the
young
lady
shaking
herself
with
vexation
you
either
can
t
understand
me
or
you
won
t
if
i
had
not
confidence
in
your
magnanimity
i
should
think
you
envied
me
but
you
will
perhaps
comprehend
this
cause
of
is
as
great
as
that
i
am
delighted
with
myself
for
my
prudence
my
my
heartlessness
if
you
please
i
was
not
a
bit
taken
by
surprise
not
a
bit
confused
or
awkward
or
foolish
i
just
acted
and
spoke
as
i
ought
to
have
done
and
was
completely
my
own
mistress
throughout
and
here
was
a
man
decidedly
and
susan
green
call
him
bewitchingly
handsome
i
suppose
they
re
two
of
the
ladies
he
pretends
would
be
so
glad
to
have
him
but
however
he
was
certainly
a
very
clever
witty
agreeable
what
you
call
clever
but
just
enough
to
make
him
entertaining
and
a
man
one
needn
t
be
ashamed
of
anywhere
and
would
not
soon
grow
tired
of
and
to
confess
the
truth
i
rather
liked
even
of
late
than
harry
he
evidently
idolised
me
and
yet
though
he
came
upon
me
all
alone
and
unprepared
i
had
the
wisdom
and
the
pride
and
the
strength
to
refuse
so
scornfully
and
coolly
as
i
did
i
have
good
reason
to
be
proud
of
and
are
you
equally
proud
of
having
told
him
that
his
having
the
wealth
of
sir
hugh
meltham
would
make
no
difference
to
you
when
that
was
not
the
case
and
of
having
promised
to
tell
no
one
of
his
misadventure
apparently
without
the
slightest
intention
of
keeping
your
promise
of
course
what
else
could
i
do
you
would
not
have
had
i
see
miss
grey
you
re
not
in
a
good
temper
here
s
matilda
i
ll
see
what
she
and
mamma
have
to
say
about
she
left
me
offended
at
my
want
of
sympathy
and
thinking
no
doubt
that
i
envied
her
i
did
least
i
firmly
believed
i
did
not
i
was
sorry
for
her
i
was
amazed
disgusted
at
her
heartless
vanity
i
wondered
why
so
much
beauty
should
be
given
to
those
who
made
so
bad
a
use
of
it
and
denied
to
some
who
would
make
it
a
benefit
to
both
themselves
and
others
but
god
knows
best
i
concluded
there
are
i
suppose
some
men
as
vain
as
selfish
and
as
heartless
as
she
is
and
perhaps
such
women
may
be
useful
to
punish
them
chapter
walk
oh
dear
i
wish
hatfield
had
not
been
so
precipitate
said
rosalie
next
day
at
four
as
with
a
portentous
yawn
she
laid
down
her
and
looked
listlessly
towards
the
window
there
s
no
inducement
to
go
out
now
and
nothing
to
look
forward
to
the
days
will
be
so
long
and
dull
when
there
are
no
parties
to
enliven
them
and
there
are
none
this
week
or
next
either
that
i
know
pity
you
were
so
cross
to
him
observed
matilda
to
whom
this
lamentation
was
addressed
he
ll
never
come
again
and
i
suspect
you
liked
him
after
all
i
hoped
you
would
have
taken
him
for
your
beau
and
left
dear
harry
to
humph
my
beau
must
be
an
adonis
indeed
matilda
the
admired
of
all
beholders
if
i
am
to
be
contented
with
him
alone
i
m
sorry
to
lose
hatfield
i
confess
but
the
first
decent
man
or
number
of
men
that
come
to
supply
his
place
will
be
more
than
welcome
it
s
sunday
do
wonder
how
he
ll
look
and
whether
he
ll
be
able
to
go
through
the
service
most
likely
he
ll
pretend
he
s
got
a
cold
and
make
weston
do
it
not
he
exclaimed
matilda
somewhat
contemptuously
fool
as
he
is
he
s
not
so
soft
as
that
comes
her
sister
was
slightly
offended
but
the
event
proved
matilda
was
right
the
disappointed
lover
performed
his
pastoral
duties
as
usual
rosalie
indeed
affirmed
he
looked
very
pale
and
dejected
he
might
be
a
little
paler
but
the
difference
if
any
was
scarcely
perceptible
as
for
his
dejection
i
certainly
did
not
hear
his
laugh
ringing
from
the
vestry
as
usual
nor
his
voice
loud
in
hilarious
discourse
though
i
did
hear
it
uplifted
in
rating
the
sexton
in
a
manner
that
made
the
congregation
stare
and
in
his
transits
to
and
from
the
pulpit
and
the
there
was
more
of
solemn
pomp
and
less
of
that
irreverent
or
rather
imperiousness
with
which
he
usually
swept
air
that
seemed
to
say
you
all
reverence
and
adore
me
i
know
but
if
anyone
does
not
i
defy
him
to
the
teeth
but
the
most
remarkable
change
was
that
he
never
once
suffered
his
eyes
to
wander
in
the
direction
of
murray
s
pew
and
did
not
leave
the
church
till
we
were
gone
hatfield
had
doubtless
received
a
very
severe
blow
but
his
pride
impelled
him
to
use
every
effort
to
conceal
the
effects
of
it
he
had
been
disappointed
in
his
certain
hope
of
obtaining
not
only
a
beautiful
and
to
him
highly
attractive
wife
but
one
whose
rank
and
fortune
might
give
brilliance
to
far
inferior
charms
he
was
likewise
no
doubt
intensely
mortified
by
his
repulse
and
deeply
offended
at
the
conduct
of
miss
murray
throughout
it
would
have
given
him
no
little
consolation
to
have
known
how
disappointed
she
was
to
find
him
apparently
so
little
moved
and
to
see
that
he
was
able
to
refrain
from
casting
a
single
glance
at
her
throughout
both
services
though
she
declared
it
showed
he
was
thinking
of
her
all
the
time
or
his
eyes
would
have
fallen
upon
her
if
it
were
only
by
chance
but
if
they
had
so
chanced
to
fall
she
would
have
affirmed
it
was
because
they
could
not
resist
the
attraction
it
might
have
pleased
him
too
in
some
degree
to
have
seen
how
dull
and
dissatisfied
she
was
throughout
that
week
the
greater
part
of
it
at
least
for
lack
of
her
usual
source
of
excitement
and
how
often
she
regretted
having
used
him
up
so
soon
like
a
child
that
having
devoured
its
plumcake
too
hastily
sits
sucking
its
fingers
and
vainly
lamenting
its
greediness
at
length
i
was
called
upon
one
fine
morning
to
accompany
her
in
a
walk
to
the
village
ostensibly
she
went
to
get
some
shades
of
berlin
wool
at
a
tolerably
respectable
shop
that
was
chiefly
supported
by
the
ladies
of
the
vicinity
trust
there
is
no
breach
of
charity
in
supposing
that
she
went
with
the
idea
of
meeting
either
with
the
rector
himself
or
some
other
admirer
by
the
way
for
as
we
went
along
she
kept
wondering
what
hatfield
would
do
or
say
if
we
met
him
as
we
passed
green
s
she
wondered
whether
he
was
at
stupid
blockhead
as
lady
meltham
s
carriage
passed
us
she
wondered
what
harry
was
doing
this
fine
day
and
then
began
to
abuse
his
elder
brother
for
being
such
a
fool
as
to
get
married
and
go
and
live
in
why
said
i
i
thought
you
wanted
to
live
in
london
yes
because
it
s
so
dull
here
but
then
he
makes
it
still
duller
by
taking
himself
off
and
if
he
were
not
married
i
might
have
him
instead
of
that
odious
sir
then
observing
the
prints
of
a
horse
s
feet
on
the
somewhat
miry
road
she
wondered
whether
it
was
a
gentleman
s
horse
and
finally
concluded
it
was
for
the
impressions
were
too
small
to
have
been
made
by
a
great
clumsy
and
then
she
wondered
who
the
rider
could
be
and
whether
we
should
meet
him
coming
back
for
she
was
sure
he
had
only
passed
that
morning
and
lastly
when
we
entered
the
village
and
saw
only
a
few
of
its
humble
inhabitants
moving
about
she
wondered
why
the
stupid
people
couldn
t
keep
in
their
houses
she
was
sure
she
didn
t
want
to
see
their
ugly
faces
and
dirty
vulgar
wasn
t
for
that
she
came
to
horton
amid
all
this
i
confess
i
wondered
too
in
secret
whether
we
should
meet
or
catch
a
glimpse
of
somebody
else
and
as
we
passed
his
lodgings
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
wonder
whether
he
was
at
the
window
on
entering
the
shop
miss
murray
desired
me
to
stand
in
the
doorway
while
she
transacted
her
business
and
tell
her
if
anyone
passed
but
alas
there
was
no
one
visible
besides
the
villagers
except
jane
and
susan
green
coming
down
the
single
street
apparently
returning
from
a
walk
stupid
things
muttered
she
as
she
came
out
after
having
concluded
her
bargain
why
couldn
t
they
have
their
dolt
of
a
brother
with
them
even
he
would
be
better
than
she
greeted
them
however
with
a
cheerful
smile
and
protestations
of
pleasure
at
the
happy
meeting
equal
to
their
own
they
placed
themselves
one
on
each
side
of
her
and
all
three
walked
away
chatting
and
laughing
as
young
ladies
do
when
they
get
together
if
they
be
but
on
tolerably
intimate
terms
but
i
feeling
myself
to
be
one
too
many
left
them
to
their
merriment
and
lagged
behind
as
usual
on
such
occasions
i
had
no
relish
for
walking
beside
miss
green
or
miss
susan
like
one
deaf
and
dumb
who
could
neither
speak
nor
be
spoken
to
but
this
time
i
was
not
long
alone
it
struck
me
first
as
very
odd
that
just
as
i
was
thinking
about
weston
he
should
come
up
and
accost
me
but
afterwards
on
due
reflection
i
thought
there
was
nothing
odd
about
it
unless
it
were
the
fact
of
his
speaking
to
me
for
on
such
a
morning
and
so
near
his
own
abode
it
was
natural
enough
that
he
should
be
about
and
as
for
my
thinking
of
him
i
had
been
doing
that
with
little
intermission
ever
since
we
set
out
on
our
journey
so
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
that
you
are
alone
again
miss
grey
said
he
what
kind
of
people
are
those
misses
green
i
really
don
t
that
s
you
live
so
near
and
see
them
so
often
well
i
suppose
they
are
lively
girls
but
i
imagine
you
must
know
them
better
than
i
do
yourself
for
i
never
exchanged
a
word
with
either
of
indeed
they
don
t
strike
me
as
being
particularly
very
likely
they
are
not
so
to
people
of
their
own
class
but
they
consider
themselves
as
moving
in
quite
a
different
sphere
from
me
he
made
no
reply
to
this
but
after
a
short
pause
he
said
i
suppose
it
s
these
things
miss
grey
that
make
you
think
you
could
not
live
without
a
home
not
exactly
the
fact
is
i
am
too
socially
disposed
to
be
able
to
live
contentedly
without
a
friend
and
as
the
only
friends
i
have
or
am
likely
to
have
are
at
home
if
rather
if
they
were
will
not
say
i
could
not
i
would
rather
not
live
in
such
a
desolate
but
why
do
you
say
the
only
friends
you
are
likely
to
have
are
you
so
unsociable
that
you
can
not
make
friends
no
but
i
never
made
one
yet
and
in
my
present
position
there
is
no
possibility
of
doing
so
or
even
of
forming
a
common
acquaintance
the
fault
may
be
partly
in
myself
but
i
hope
not
the
fault
is
partly
in
society
and
partly
i
should
think
in
your
immediate
neighbours
and
partly
too
in
yourself
for
many
ladies
in
your
position
would
make
themselves
be
noticed
and
accounted
of
but
your
pupils
should
be
companions
for
you
in
some
degree
they
can
not
be
many
years
younger
than
oh
yes
they
are
good
company
sometimes
but
i
can
not
call
them
friends
nor
would
they
think
of
bestowing
such
a
name
on
have
other
companions
better
suited
to
their
perhaps
you
are
too
wise
for
them
how
do
you
amuse
yourself
when
you
read
much
reading
is
my
favourite
occupation
when
i
have
leisure
for
it
and
books
to
from
speaking
of
books
in
general
he
passed
to
different
books
in
particular
and
proceeded
by
rapid
transitions
from
topic
to
topic
till
several
matters
both
of
taste
and
opinion
had
been
discussed
considerably
within
the
space
of
half
an
hour
but
without
the
embellishment
of
many
observations
from
himself
he
being
evidently
less
bent
upon
communicating
his
own
thoughts
and
predilections
than
on
discovering
mine
he
had
not
the
tact
or
the
art
to
effect
such
a
purpose
by
skilfully
drawing
out
my
sentiments
or
ideas
through
the
real
or
apparent
statement
of
his
own
or
leading
the
conversation
by
imperceptible
gradations
to
such
topics
as
he
wished
to
advert
to
but
such
gentle
abruptness
and
such
straightforwardness
could
not
possibly
offend
me
and
why
should
he
interest
himself
at
all
in
my
moral
and
intellectual
capacities
what
is
it
to
him
what
i
think
or
feel
i
asked
myself
and
my
heart
throbbed
in
answer
to
the
question
but
jane
and
susan
green
soon
reached
their
home
as
they
stood
parleying
at
the
attempting
to
persuade
miss
murray
to
come
in
i
wished
weston
would
go
that
she
might
not
see
him
with
me
when
she
turned
round
but
unfortunately
his
business
which
was
to
pay
one
more
visit
to
poor
mark
wood
led
him
to
pursue
the
same
path
as
we
did
till
nearly
the
close
of
our
journey
when
however
he
saw
that
rosalie
had
taken
leave
of
her
friends
and
i
was
about
to
join
her
he
would
have
left
me
and
passed
on
at
a
quicker
pace
but
as
he
civilly
lifted
his
hat
in
passing
her
to
my
surprise
instead
of
returning
the
salute
with
a
stiff
ungracious
bow
she
accosted
him
with
one
of
her
sweetest
smiles
and
walking
by
his
side
began
to
talk
to
him
with
all
imaginable
cheerfulness
and
affability
and
so
we
proceeded
all
three
together
after
a
short
pause
in
the
conversation
weston
made
some
remark
addressed
particularly
to
me
as
referring
to
something
we
had
been
talking
of
before
but
before
i
could
answer
miss
murray
replied
to
the
observation
and
enlarged
upon
it
he
rejoined
and
from
thence
to
the
close
of
the
interview
she
engrossed
him
entirely
to
herself
it
might
be
partly
owing
to
my
own
stupidity
my
want
of
tact
and
assurance
but
i
felt
myself
wronged
i
trembled
with
apprehension
and
i
listened
with
envy
to
her
easy
rapid
flow
of
utterance
and
saw
with
anxiety
the
bright
smile
with
which
she
looked
into
his
face
from
time
to
time
for
she
was
walking
a
little
in
advance
for
the
purpose
as
i
judged
of
being
seen
as
well
as
heard
if
her
conversation
was
light
and
trivial
it
was
amusing
and
she
was
never
at
a
loss
for
something
to
say
or
for
suitable
words
to
express
it
in
there
was
nothing
pert
or
flippant
in
her
manner
now
as
when
she
walked
with
hatfield
there
was
only
a
gentle
playful
kind
of
vivacity
which
i
thought
must
be
peculiarly
pleasing
to
a
man
of
weston
s
disposition
and
temperament
when
he
was
gone
she
began
to
laugh
and
muttered
to
herself
i
thought
i
could
do
it
do
what
i
asked
fix
that
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
he
will
go
home
and
dream
of
me
i
have
shot
him
through
the
heart
how
do
you
know
by
many
infallible
proofs
more
especially
the
look
he
gave
me
when
he
went
away
it
was
not
an
impudent
exonerate
him
from
was
a
look
of
reverential
tender
adoration
ha
ha
he
s
not
quite
such
a
stupid
blockhead
as
i
thought
him
i
made
no
answer
for
my
heart
was
in
my
throat
or
something
like
it
and
i
could
not
trust
myself
to
speak
o
god
avert
it
i
cried
for
his
sake
not
for
mine
miss
murray
made
several
trivial
observations
as
we
passed
up
the
park
to
which
in
spite
of
my
reluctance
to
let
one
glimpse
of
my
feelings
appear
i
could
only
answer
by
monosyllables
whether
she
intended
to
torment
me
or
merely
to
amuse
herself
i
could
not
did
not
much
care
but
i
thought
of
the
poor
man
and
his
one
lamb
and
the
rich
man
with
his
thousand
flocks
and
i
dreaded
i
knew
not
what
for
weston
independently
of
my
own
blighted
hopes
right
glad
was
i
to
get
into
the
house
and
find
myself
alone
once
more
in
my
own
room
my
first
impulse
was
to
sink
into
the
chair
beside
the
bed
and
laying
my
head
on
the
pillow
to
seek
relief
in
a
passionate
burst
of
tears
there
was
an
imperative
craving
for
such
an
indulgence
but
alas
i
must
restrain
and
swallow
back
my
feelings
still
there
was
the
odious
bell
for
the
schoolroom
dinner
and
i
must
go
down
with
a
calm
face
and
smile
and
laugh
and
talk
and
eat
too
if
possible
as
if
all
was
right
and
i
was
just
returned
from
a
pleasant
walk
chapter
substitution
next
sunday
was
one
of
the
gloomiest
of
april
day
of
thick
dark
clouds
and
heavy
showers
none
of
the
murrays
were
disposed
to
attend
church
in
the
afternoon
excepting
rosalie
she
was
bent
upon
going
as
usual
so
she
ordered
the
carriage
and
i
went
with
her
nothing
loth
of
course
for
at
church
i
might
look
without
fear
of
scorn
or
censure
upon
a
form
and
face
more
pleasing
to
me
than
the
most
beautiful
of
god
s
creations
i
might
listen
without
disturbance
to
a
voice
more
charming
than
the
sweetest
music
to
my
ears
i
might
seem
to
hold
communion
with
that
soul
in
which
i
felt
so
deeply
interested
and
imbibe
its
purest
thoughts
and
holiest
aspirations
with
no
alloy
to
such
felicity
except
the
secret
reproaches
of
my
conscience
which
would
too
often
whisper
that
i
was
deceiving
my
own
self
and
mocking
god
with
the
service
of
a
heart
more
bent
upon
the
creature
than
the
creator
sometimes
such
thoughts
would
give
me
trouble
enough
but
sometimes
i
could
quiet
them
with
is
not
the
man
it
is
his
goodness
that
i
love
whatsoever
things
are
pure
whatsoever
things
are
lovely
whatsoever
things
are
honest
and
of
good
report
think
on
these
we
do
well
to
worship
god
in
his
works
and
i
know
none
of
them
in
which
so
many
of
his
much
of
his
own
spirit
shines
as
in
this
his
faithful
servant
whom
to
know
and
not
to
appreciate
were
obtuse
insensibility
in
me
who
have
so
little
else
to
occupy
my
heart
almost
immediately
after
the
conclusion
of
the
service
miss
murray
left
the
church
we
had
to
stand
in
the
porch
for
it
was
raining
and
the
carriage
was
not
yet
come
i
wondered
at
her
coming
forth
so
hastily
for
neither
young
meltham
nor
squire
green
was
there
but
i
soon
found
it
was
to
secure
an
interview
with
weston
as
he
came
out
which
he
presently
did
having
saluted
us
both
he
would
have
passed
on
but
she
detained
him
first
with
observations
upon
the
disagreeable
weather
and
then
with
asking
if
he
would
be
so
kind
as
to
come
some
time
to
see
the
granddaughter
of
the
old
woman
who
kept
the
porter
s
lodge
for
the
girl
was
ill
of
a
fever
and
wished
to
see
him
he
promised
to
do
so
and
at
what
time
will
you
be
most
likely
to
come
weston
the
old
woman
will
like
to
know
when
to
expect
know
such
people
think
more
about
having
their
cottages
in
order
when
decent
people
come
to
see
them
than
we
are
apt
to
here
was
a
wonderful
instance
of
consideration
from
the
thoughtless
miss
murray
weston
named
an
hour
in
the
morning
at
which
he
would
endeavour
to
be
there
by
this
time
the
carriage
was
ready
and
the
footman
was
waiting
with
an
open
umbrella
to
escort
miss
murray
through
the
churchyard
i
was
about
to
follow
but
weston
had
an
umbrella
too
and
offered
me
the
benefit
of
its
shelter
for
it
was
raining
heavily
no
thank
you
i
don
t
mind
the
rain
i
said
i
always
lacked
common
sense
when
taken
by
surprise
but
you
don
t
it
i
suppose
umbrella
will
do
you
no
harm
at
any
rate
he
replied
with
a
smile
that
showed
he
was
not
offended
as
a
man
of
worse
temper
or
less
penetration
would
have
been
at
such
a
refusal
of
his
aid
i
could
not
deny
the
truth
of
his
assertion
and
so
went
with
him
to
the
carriage
he
even
offered
me
his
hand
on
getting
in
an
unnecessary
piece
of
civility
but
i
accepted
that
too
for
fear
of
giving
offence
one
glance
he
gave
one
little
smile
at
was
but
for
a
moment
but
therein
i
read
or
thought
i
read
a
meaning
that
kindled
in
my
heart
a
brighter
flame
of
hope
than
had
ever
yet
arisen
i
would
have
sent
the
footman
back
for
you
miss
grey
if
you
d
waited
a
needn
t
have
taken
weston
s
umbrella
observed
rosalie
with
a
very
unamiable
cloud
upon
her
pretty
face
i
would
have
come
without
an
umbrella
but
weston
offered
me
the
benefit
of
his
and
i
could
not
have
refused
it
more
than
i
did
without
offending
him
replied
i
smiling
placidly
for
my
inward
happiness
made
that
amusing
which
would
have
wounded
me
at
another
time
the
carriage
was
now
in
motion
miss
murray
bent
forwards
and
looked
out
of
the
window
as
we
were
passing
weston
he
was
pacing
homewards
along
the
causeway
and
did
not
turn
his
head
stupid
ass
cried
she
throwing
herself
back
again
in
the
seat
you
don
t
know
what
you
ve
lost
by
not
looking
this
way
what
has
he
lost
a
bow
from
me
that
would
have
raised
him
to
the
seventh
heaven
i
made
no
answer
i
saw
she
was
out
of
humour
and
i
derived
a
secret
gratification
from
the
fact
not
that
she
was
vexed
but
that
she
thought
she
had
reason
to
be
so
it
made
me
think
my
hopes
were
not
entirely
the
offspring
of
my
wishes
and
imagination
i
mean
to
take
up
weston
instead
of
hatfield
said
my
companion
after
a
short
pause
resuming
something
of
her
usual
cheerfulness
the
ball
at
ashby
park
takes
place
on
tuesday
you
know
and
mamma
thinks
it
very
likely
that
sir
thomas
will
propose
to
me
then
such
things
are
often
done
in
the
privacy
of
the
when
gentlemen
are
most
easily
ensnared
and
ladies
most
enchanting
but
if
i
am
to
be
married
so
soon
i
must
make
the
best
of
the
present
time
i
am
determined
hatfield
shall
not
be
the
only
man
who
shall
lay
his
heart
at
my
feet
and
implore
me
to
accept
the
worthless
gift
in
if
you
mean
weston
to
be
one
of
your
victims
said
i
with
affected
indifference
you
will
have
to
make
such
overtures
yourself
that
you
will
find
it
difficult
to
draw
back
when
he
asks
you
to
fulfil
the
expectations
you
have
i
don
t
suppose
he
will
ask
me
to
marry
him
nor
should
i
desire
it
that
would
be
rather
too
much
presumption
but
i
intend
him
to
feel
my
power
he
has
felt
it
already
indeed
but
he
shall
it
too
and
what
visionary
hopes
he
may
have
he
must
keep
to
himself
and
only
amuse
me
with
the
result
of
a
oh
that
some
kind
spirit
would
whisper
those
words
in
his
ear
i
inwardly
exclaimed
i
was
far
too
indignant
to
hazard
a
reply
to
her
observation
aloud
and
nothing
more
was
said
about
weston
that
day
by
me
or
in
my
hearing
but
next
morning
soon
after
breakfast
miss
murray
came
into
the
schoolroom
where
her
sister
was
employed
at
her
studies
or
rather
her
lessons
for
studies
they
were
not
and
said
matilda
i
want
you
to
take
a
walk
with
me
about
eleven
o
oh
i
can
t
rosalie
i
have
to
give
orders
about
my
new
bridle
and
and
speak
to
the
about
his
dogs
miss
grey
must
go
with
no
i
want
you
said
rosalie
and
calling
her
sister
to
the
window
she
whispered
an
explanation
in
her
ear
upon
which
the
latter
consented
to
go
i
remembered
that
eleven
was
the
hour
at
which
weston
proposed
to
come
to
the
porter
s
lodge
and
remembering
that
i
beheld
the
whole
contrivance
accordingly
at
dinner
i
was
entertained
with
a
long
account
of
how
weston
had
overtaken
them
as
they
were
walking
along
the
road
and
how
they
had
had
a
long
walk
and
talk
with
him
and
really
found
him
quite
an
agreeable
companion
and
how
he
must
have
been
and
evidently
was
delighted
with
them
and
their
amazing
condescension
chapter
as
i
am
in
the
way
of
confessions
i
may
as
well
acknowledge
that
about
this
time
i
paid
more
attention
to
dress
than
ever
i
had
done
before
this
is
not
saying
hitherto
i
had
been
a
little
neglectful
in
that
particular
but
now
also
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
to
spend
as
much
as
two
minutes
in
the
contemplation
of
my
own
image
in
the
glass
though
i
never
could
derive
any
consolation
from
such
a
study
i
could
discover
no
beauty
in
those
marked
features
that
pale
hollow
cheek
and
ordinary
dark
brown
hair
there
might
be
intellect
in
the
forehead
there
might
be
expression
in
the
dark
grey
eyes
but
what
of
that
low
grecian
brow
and
large
black
eyes
devoid
of
sentiment
would
be
esteemed
far
preferable
it
is
foolish
to
wish
for
beauty
sensible
people
never
either
desire
it
for
themselves
or
care
about
it
in
others
if
the
mind
be
but
well
cultivated
and
the
heart
well
disposed
no
one
ever
cares
for
the
exterior
so
said
the
teachers
of
our
childhood
and
so
say
we
to
the
children
of
the
present
day
all
very
judicious
and
proper
no
doubt
but
are
such
assertions
supported
by
actual
experience
we
are
naturally
disposed
to
love
what
gives
us
pleasure
and
what
more
pleasing
than
a
beautiful
we
know
no
harm
of
the
possessor
at
least
a
little
girl
loves
her
because
it
lives
and
feels
because
it
is
helpless
and
harmless
a
toad
likewise
lives
and
feels
and
is
equally
helpless
and
harmless
but
though
she
would
not
hurt
a
toad
she
can
not
love
it
like
the
bird
with
its
graceful
form
soft
feathers
and
bright
speaking
eyes
if
a
woman
is
fair
and
amiable
she
is
praised
for
both
qualities
but
especially
the
former
by
the
bulk
of
mankind
if
on
the
other
hand
she
is
disagreeable
in
person
and
character
her
plainness
is
commonly
inveighed
against
as
her
greatest
crime
because
to
common
observers
it
gives
the
greatest
offence
while
if
she
is
plain
and
good
provided
she
is
a
person
of
retired
manners
and
secluded
life
no
one
ever
knows
of
her
goodness
except
her
immediate
connections
others
on
the
contrary
are
disposed
to
form
unfavourable
opinions
of
her
mind
and
disposition
if
it
be
but
to
excuse
themselves
for
their
instinctive
dislike
of
one
so
unfavoured
by
nature
and
with
her
whose
angel
form
conceals
a
vicious
heart
or
sheds
a
false
deceitful
charm
over
defects
and
foibles
that
would
not
be
tolerated
in
another
they
that
have
beauty
let
them
be
thankful
for
it
and
make
a
good
use
of
it
like
any
other
talent
they
that
have
it
not
let
them
console
themselves
and
do
the
best
they
can
without
it
certainly
though
liable
to
be
it
is
a
gift
of
god
and
not
to
be
despised
many
will
feel
this
who
have
felt
that
they
could
love
and
whose
hearts
tell
them
that
they
are
worthy
to
be
loved
again
while
yet
they
are
debarred
by
the
lack
of
this
or
some
such
seeming
trifle
from
giving
and
receiving
that
happiness
they
seem
almost
made
to
feel
and
to
impart
as
well
might
the
humble
glowworm
despise
that
power
of
giving
light
without
which
the
roving
fly
might
pass
her
and
repass
her
a
thousand
times
and
never
rest
beside
her
she
might
hear
her
winged
darling
buzzing
over
and
around
her
he
vainly
seeking
her
she
longing
to
be
found
but
with
no
power
to
make
her
presence
known
no
voice
to
call
him
no
wings
to
follow
his
flight
fly
must
seek
another
mate
the
worm
must
live
and
die
alone
such
were
some
of
my
reflections
about
this
period
i
might
go
on
prosing
more
and
more
i
might
dive
much
deeper
and
disclose
other
thoughts
propose
questions
the
reader
might
be
puzzled
to
answer
and
deduce
arguments
that
might
startle
his
prejudices
or
perhaps
provoke
his
ridicule
because
he
could
not
comprehend
them
but
i
forbear
now
therefore
let
us
return
to
miss
murray
she
accompanied
her
mamma
to
the
ball
on
tuesday
of
course
splendidly
attired
and
delighted
with
her
prospects
and
her
charms
as
ashby
park
was
nearly
ten
miles
distant
from
horton
lodge
they
had
to
set
out
pretty
early
and
i
intended
to
have
spent
the
evening
with
nancy
brown
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
a
long
time
but
my
kind
pupil
took
care
i
should
spend
it
neither
there
nor
anywhere
else
beyond
the
limits
of
the
schoolroom
by
giving
me
a
piece
of
music
to
copy
which
kept
me
closely
occupied
till
about
eleven
next
morning
as
soon
as
she
had
left
her
room
she
came
to
tell
me
her
news
sir
thomas
had
indeed
proposed
to
her
at
the
ball
an
event
which
reflected
great
credit
on
her
mamma
s
sagacity
if
not
upon
her
skill
in
contrivance
i
rather
incline
to
the
belief
that
she
had
first
laid
her
plans
and
then
predicted
their
success
the
offer
had
been
accepted
of
course
and
the
bridegroom
elect
was
coming
that
day
to
settle
matters
with
murray
rosalie
was
pleased
with
the
thoughts
of
becoming
mistress
of
ashby
park
she
was
elated
with
the
prospect
of
the
bridal
ceremony
and
its
attendant
splendour
and
Ã©clat
the
honeymoon
spent
abroad
and
the
subsequent
gaieties
she
expected
to
enjoy
in
london
and
elsewhere
she
appeared
pretty
well
pleased
too
for
the
time
being
with
sir
thomas
himself
because
she
had
so
lately
seen
him
danced
with
him
and
been
flattered
by
him
but
after
all
she
seemed
to
shrink
from
the
idea
of
being
so
soon
united
she
wished
the
ceremony
to
be
delayed
some
months
at
least
and
i
wished
it
too
it
seemed
a
horrible
thing
to
hurry
on
the
inauspicious
match
and
not
to
give
the
poor
creature
time
to
think
and
reason
on
the
irrevocable
step
she
was
about
to
take
i
made
no
pretension
to
a
mother
s
watchful
anxious
care
but
i
was
amazed
and
horrified
at
murray
s
heartlessness
or
want
of
thought
for
the
real
good
of
her
child
and
by
my
unheeded
warnings
and
exhortations
i
vainly
strove
to
remedy
the
evil
miss
murray
only
laughed
at
what
i
said
and
i
soon
found
that
her
reluctance
to
an
immediate
union
arose
chiefly
from
a
desire
to
do
what
execution
she
could
among
the
young
gentlemen
of
her
acquaintance
before
she
was
incapacitated
from
further
mischief
of
the
kind
it
was
for
this
cause
that
before
confiding
to
me
the
secret
of
her
engagement
she
had
extracted
a
promise
that
i
would
not
mention
a
word
on
the
subject
to
any
one
and
when
i
saw
this
and
when
i
beheld
her
plunge
more
recklessly
than
ever
into
the
depths
of
heartless
coquetry
i
had
no
more
pity
for
her
come
what
will
i
thought
she
deserves
it
sir
thomas
can
not
be
too
bad
for
her
and
the
sooner
she
is
incapacitated
from
deceiving
and
injuring
others
the
the
wedding
was
fixed
for
the
first
of
june
between
that
and
the
critical
ball
was
little
more
than
six
weeks
but
with
rosalie
s
accomplished
skill
and
resolute
exertion
much
might
be
done
even
within
that
period
especially
as
sir
thomas
spent
most
of
the
interim
in
london
whither
he
went
up
it
was
said
to
settle
affairs
with
his
lawyer
and
make
other
preparations
for
the
approaching
nuptials
he
endeavoured
to
supply
the
want
of
his
presence
by
a
pretty
constant
fire
of
but
these
did
not
attract
the
neighbours
attention
and
open
their
eyes
as
personal
visits
would
have
done
and
old
lady
ashby
s
haughty
sour
spirit
of
reserve
withheld
her
from
spreading
the
news
while
her
indifferent
health
prevented
her
coming
to
visit
her
future
so
that
altogether
this
affair
was
kept
far
closer
than
such
things
usually
are
rosalie
would
sometimes
show
her
lover
s
epistles
to
me
to
convince
me
what
a
kind
devoted
husband
he
would
make
she
showed
me
the
letters
of
another
individual
too
the
unfortunate
green
who
had
not
the
courage
or
as
she
expressed
it
the
spunk
to
plead
his
cause
in
person
but
whom
one
denial
would
not
satisfy
he
must
write
again
and
again
he
would
not
have
done
so
if
he
could
have
seen
the
grimaces
his
fair
idol
made
over
his
moving
appeals
to
her
feelings
and
heard
her
scornful
laughter
and
the
opprobrious
epithets
she
heaped
upon
him
for
his
perseverance
why
don
t
you
tell
him
at
once
that
you
are
engaged
i
asked
oh
i
don
t
want
him
to
know
that
replied
she
if
he
knew
it
his
sisters
and
everybody
would
know
it
and
then
there
would
be
an
end
of
and
besides
if
i
told
him
that
he
would
think
my
engagement
was
the
only
obstacle
and
that
i
would
have
him
if
i
were
free
which
i
could
not
bear
that
any
man
should
think
and
he
of
all
others
at
least
besides
i
don
t
care
for
his
letters
she
added
contemptuously
he
may
write
as
often
as
he
pleases
and
look
as
great
a
calf
as
he
likes
when
i
meet
him
it
only
amuses
meantime
young
meltham
was
pretty
frequent
in
his
visits
to
the
house
or
transits
past
it
and
judging
by
matilda
s
execrations
and
reproaches
her
sister
paid
more
attention
to
him
than
civility
required
in
other
words
she
carried
on
as
animated
a
flirtation
as
the
presence
of
her
parents
would
admit
she
made
some
attempts
to
bring
hatfield
once
more
to
her
feet
but
finding
them
unsuccessful
she
repaid
his
haughty
indifference
with
still
loftier
scorn
and
spoke
of
him
with
as
much
disdain
and
detestation
as
she
had
formerly
done
of
his
curate
but
amid
all
this
she
never
for
a
moment
lost
sight
of
weston
she
embraced
every
opportunity
of
meeting
him
tried
every
art
to
fascinate
him
and
pursued
him
with
as
much
perseverance
as
if
she
really
loved
him
and
no
other
and
the
happiness
of
her
life
depended
upon
eliciting
a
return
of
affection
such
conduct
was
completely
beyond
my
comprehension
had
i
seen
it
depicted
in
a
novel
i
should
have
thought
it
unnatural
had
i
heard
it
described
by
others
i
should
have
deemed
it
a
mistake
or
an
exaggeration
but
when
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
and
suffered
from
it
too
i
could
only
conclude
that
excessive
vanity
like
drunkenness
hardens
the
heart
enslaves
the
faculties
and
perverts
the
feelings
and
that
dogs
are
not
the
only
creatures
which
when
gorged
to
the
throat
will
yet
gloat
over
what
they
can
not
devour
and
grudge
the
smallest
morsel
to
a
starving
brother
she
now
became
extremely
beneficent
to
the
poor
cottagers
her
acquaintance
among
them
was
more
widely
extended
her
visits
to
their
humble
dwellings
were
more
frequent
and
excursive
than
they
had
ever
been
before
hereby
she
earned
among
them
the
reputation
of
a
condescending
and
very
charitable
young
lady
and
their
encomiums
were
sure
to
be
repeated
to
weston
whom
also
she
had
thus
a
daily
chance
of
meeting
in
one
or
other
of
their
abodes
or
in
her
transits
to
and
fro
and
often
likewise
she
could
gather
through
their
gossip
to
what
places
he
was
likely
to
go
at
such
and
such
a
time
whether
to
baptize
a
child
or
to
visit
the
aged
the
sick
the
sad
or
the
dying
and
most
skilfully
she
laid
her
plans
accordingly
in
these
excursions
she
would
sometimes
go
with
her
by
some
means
she
had
persuaded
or
bribed
to
enter
into
her
alone
never
now
with
me
so
that
i
was
debarred
the
pleasure
of
seeing
weston
or
hearing
his
voice
even
in
conversation
with
another
which
would
certainly
have
been
a
very
great
pleasure
however
hurtful
or
however
fraught
with
pain
i
could
not
even
see
him
at
church
for
miss
murray
under
some
trivial
pretext
chose
to
take
possession
of
that
corner
in
the
family
pew
which
had
been
mine
ever
since
i
came
and
unless
i
had
the
presumption
to
station
myself
between
and
murray
i
must
sit
with
my
back
to
the
pulpit
which
i
accordingly
did
now
also
i
never
walked
home
with
my
pupils
they
said
their
mamma
thought
it
did
not
look
well
to
see
three
people
out
of
the
family
walking
and
only
two
going
in
the
carriage
and
as
they
greatly
preferred
walking
in
fine
weather
i
should
be
honoured
by
going
with
the
seniors
and
besides
said
they
you
can
t
walk
as
fast
as
we
do
you
know
you
re
always
lagging
i
knew
these
were
false
excuses
but
i
made
no
objections
and
never
contradicted
such
assertions
well
knowing
the
motives
which
dictated
them
and
in
the
afternoons
during
those
six
memorable
weeks
i
never
went
to
church
at
all
if
i
had
a
cold
or
any
slight
indisposition
they
took
advantage
of
that
to
make
me
stay
at
home
and
often
they
would
tell
me
they
were
not
going
again
that
day
themselves
and
then
pretend
to
change
their
minds
and
set
off
without
telling
me
so
managing
their
departure
that
i
never
discovered
the
change
of
purpose
till
too
late
upon
their
return
home
on
one
of
these
occasions
they
entertained
me
with
an
animated
account
of
a
conversation
they
had
had
with
weston
as
they
came
along
and
he
asked
if
you
were
ill
miss
grey
said
matilda
but
we
told
him
you
were
quite
well
only
you
didn
t
want
to
come
to
he
ll
think
you
re
turned
all
chance
meetings
on
were
likewise
carefully
prevented
for
lest
i
should
go
to
see
poor
nancy
brown
or
any
other
person
miss
murray
took
good
care
to
provide
sufficient
employment
for
all
my
leisure
hours
there
was
always
some
drawing
to
finish
some
music
to
copy
or
some
work
to
do
sufficient
to
incapacitate
me
from
indulging
in
anything
beyond
a
short
walk
about
the
grounds
however
she
or
her
sister
might
be
occupied
one
morning
having
sought
and
waylaid
weston
they
returned
in
high
glee
to
give
me
an
account
of
their
interview
and
he
asked
after
you
again
said
matilda
in
spite
of
her
sister
s
silent
but
imperative
intimation
that
she
should
hold
her
tongue
he
wondered
why
you
were
never
with
us
and
thought
you
must
have
delicate
health
as
you
came
out
so
he
didn
t
nonsense
you
re
talking
oh
rosalie
what
a
lie
he
did
you
know
and
you
t
it
won
t
be
pinched
so
and
miss
grey
rosalie
told
him
you
were
quite
well
but
you
were
always
so
buried
in
your
books
that
you
had
no
pleasure
in
anything
what
an
idea
he
must
have
of
me
i
thought
and
i
asked
does
old
nancy
ever
inquire
about
me
yes
and
we
tell
her
you
are
so
fond
of
reading
and
drawing
that
you
can
do
nothing
that
is
not
the
case
though
if
you
had
told
her
i
was
so
busy
i
could
not
come
to
see
her
it
would
have
been
nearer
the
i
don
t
think
it
would
replied
miss
murray
suddenly
kindling
up
i
m
sure
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
yourself
now
when
you
have
so
little
teaching
to
it
was
no
use
beginning
to
dispute
with
such
indulged
unreasoning
creatures
so
i
held
my
peace
i
was
accustomed
now
to
keeping
silence
when
things
distasteful
to
my
ear
were
uttered
and
now
too
i
was
used
to
wearing
a
placid
smiling
countenance
when
my
heart
was
bitter
within
me
only
those
who
have
felt
the
like
can
imagine
my
feelings
as
i
sat
with
an
assumption
of
smiling
indifference
listening
to
the
accounts
of
those
meetings
and
interviews
with
weston
which
they
seemed
to
find
such
pleasure
in
describing
to
me
and
hearing
things
asserted
of
him
which
from
the
character
of
the
man
i
knew
to
be
exaggerations
and
perversions
of
the
truth
if
not
entirely
derogatory
to
him
and
flattering
to
to
miss
i
burned
to
contradict
or
at
least
to
show
my
doubts
about
but
dared
not
lest
in
expressing
my
disbelief
i
should
display
my
interest
too
other
things
i
heard
which
i
felt
or
feared
were
indeed
too
true
but
i
must
still
conceal
my
anxiety
respecting
him
my
indignation
against
them
beneath
a
careless
aspect
others
again
mere
hints
of
something
said
or
done
which
i
longed
to
hear
more
of
but
could
not
venture
to
inquire
so
passed
the
weary
time
i
could
not
even
comfort
myself
with
saying
she
will
soon
be
married
and
then
there
may
be
soon
after
her
marriage
the
holidays
would
come
and
when
i
returned
from
home
most
likely
weston
would
be
gone
for
i
was
told
that
he
and
the
rector
could
not
agree
the
rector
s
fault
of
course
and
he
was
about
to
remove
to
another
place
my
hope
in
god
my
only
consolation
was
in
thinking
that
though
he
know
it
not
i
was
more
worthy
of
his
love
than
rosalie
murray
charming
and
engaging
as
she
was
for
i
could
appreciate
his
excellence
which
she
could
not
i
would
devote
my
life
to
the
promotion
of
his
happiness
she
would
destroy
his
happiness
for
the
momentary
gratification
of
her
own
vanity
oh
if
he
could
but
know
the
difference
i
would
earnestly
exclaim
but
no
i
would
not
have
him
see
my
heart
yet
if
he
could
but
know
her
hollowness
her
worthless
heartless
frivolity
he
would
then
be
safe
and
i
should
happy
though
i
might
never
see
him
more
i
fear
by
this
time
the
reader
is
well
nigh
disgusted
with
the
folly
and
weakness
i
have
so
freely
laid
before
him
i
never
disclosed
it
then
and
would
not
have
done
so
had
my
own
sister
or
my
mother
been
with
me
in
the
house
i
was
a
close
and
resolute
this
one
case
at
least
my
prayers
my
tears
my
wishes
fears
and
lamentations
were
witnessed
by
myself
and
heaven
alone
when
we
are
harassed
by
sorrows
or
anxieties
or
long
oppressed
by
any
powerful
feelings
which
we
must
keep
to
ourselves
for
which
we
can
obtain
and
seek
no
sympathy
from
any
living
creature
and
which
yet
we
can
not
or
will
not
wholly
crush
we
often
naturally
seek
relief
in
often
find
it
in
the
effusions
of
others
which
seem
to
harmonize
with
our
existing
case
or
in
our
own
attempts
to
give
utterance
to
those
thoughts
and
feelings
in
strains
less
musical
perchance
but
more
appropriate
and
therefore
more
penetrating
and
sympathetic
and
for
the
time
more
soothing
or
more
powerful
to
rouse
and
to
unburden
the
oppressed
and
swollen
heart
before
this
time
at
wellwood
house
and
here
when
suffering
from
melancholy
i
had
sought
relief
twice
or
thrice
at
this
secret
source
of
consolation
and
now
i
flew
to
it
again
with
greater
avidity
than
ever
because
i
seemed
to
need
it
more
i
still
preserve
those
relics
of
past
sufferings
and
experience
like
pillars
of
witness
set
up
in
travelling
through
the
vale
of
life
to
mark
particular
occurrences
the
footsteps
are
obliterated
now
the
face
of
the
country
may
be
changed
but
the
pillar
is
still
there
to
remind
me
how
all
things
were
when
it
was
reared
lest
the
reader
should
be
curious
to
see
any
of
these
effusions
i
will
favour
him
with
one
short
specimen
cold
and
languid
as
the
lines
may
seem
it
was
almost
a
passion
of
grief
to
which
they
owed
their
being
oh
they
have
robbed
me
of
the
hope
my
spirit
held
so
dear
they
will
not
let
me
hear
that
voice
my
soul
delights
to
hear
they
will
not
let
me
see
that
face
i
so
delight
to
see
and
they
have
taken
all
thy
smiles
and
all
thy
love
from
me
well
let
them
seize
on
all
they
can
one
treasure
still
is
mine
a
heart
that
loves
to
think
on
thee
and
feels
the
worth
of
thine
yes
at
least
they
could
not
deprive
me
of
that
i
could
think
of
him
day
and
night
and
i
could
feel
that
he
was
worthy
to
be
thought
of
nobody
knew
him
as
i
did
nobody
could
appreciate
him
as
i
did
nobody
could
love
him
as
if
i
might
but
there
was
the
evil
what
business
had
i
to
think
so
much
of
one
that
never
thought
of
me
was
it
not
foolish
was
it
not
wrong
yet
if
i
found
such
deep
delight
in
thinking
of
him
and
if
i
kept
those
thoughts
to
myself
and
troubled
no
one
else
with
them
where
was
the
harm
of
it
i
would
ask
myself
and
such
reasoning
prevented
me
from
making
any
sufficient
effort
to
shake
off
my
fetters
but
if
those
thoughts
brought
delight
it
was
a
painful
troubled
pleasure
too
near
akin
to
anguish
and
one
that
did
me
more
injury
than
i
was
aware
of
it
was
an
indulgence
that
a
person
of
more
wisdom
or
more
experience
would
doubtless
have
denied
herself
and
yet
how
dreary
to
turn
my
eyes
from
the
contemplation
of
that
bright
object
and
force
them
to
dwell
on
the
dull
grey
desolate
prospect
around
the
joyless
hopeless
solitary
path
that
lay
before
me
it
was
wrong
to
be
so
joyless
so
desponding
i
should
have
made
god
my
friend
and
to
do
his
will
the
pleasure
and
the
business
of
my
life
but
faith
was
weak
and
passion
was
too
strong
in
this
time
of
trouble
i
had
two
other
causes
of
affliction
the
first
may
seem
a
trifle
but
it
cost
me
many
a
tear
snap
my
little
dumb
but
companion
the
only
thing
i
had
to
love
me
was
taken
away
and
delivered
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
village
a
man
notorious
for
his
brutal
treatment
of
his
canine
slaves
the
other
was
serious
enough
my
letters
from
home
gave
intimation
that
my
father
s
health
was
worse
no
boding
fears
were
expressed
but
i
was
grown
timid
and
despondent
and
could
not
help
fearing
that
some
dreadful
calamity
awaited
us
there
i
seemed
to
see
the
black
clouds
gathering
round
my
native
hills
and
to
hear
the
angry
muttering
of
a
storm
that
was
about
to
burst
and
desolate
our
hearth
chapter
and
mourning
the
of
june
arrived
at
last
and
rosalie
murray
was
transmuted
into
lady
ashby
most
splendidly
beautiful
she
looked
in
her
bridal
costume
upon
her
return
from
church
after
the
ceremony
she
came
flying
into
the
schoolroom
flushed
with
excitement
and
laughing
half
in
mirth
and
half
in
reckless
desperation
as
it
seemed
to
me
now
miss
grey
i
m
lady
ashby
she
exclaimed
it
s
done
my
fate
is
sealed
there
s
no
drawing
back
now
i
m
come
to
receive
your
congratulations
and
bid
you
and
then
i
m
off
for
paris
rome
naples
switzerland
dear
what
a
deal
i
shall
see
and
hear
before
i
come
back
again
but
don
t
forget
me
i
shan
t
forget
you
though
i
ve
been
a
naughty
girl
come
why
don
t
you
congratulate
me
i
can
not
congratulate
you
i
replied
till
i
know
whether
this
change
is
really
for
the
better
but
i
sincerely
hope
it
is
and
i
wish
you
true
happiness
and
the
best
of
well
the
carriage
is
waiting
and
they
re
calling
she
gave
me
a
hasty
kiss
and
was
hurrying
away
but
suddenly
returning
embraced
me
with
more
affection
than
i
thought
her
capable
of
evincing
and
departed
with
tears
in
her
eyes
poor
girl
i
really
loved
her
then
and
forgave
her
from
my
heart
all
the
injury
she
had
done
others
also
she
had
not
half
known
it
i
was
sure
and
i
prayed
god
to
pardon
her
too
during
the
remainder
of
that
day
of
festal
sadness
i
was
left
to
my
own
devices
being
too
much
unhinged
for
any
steady
occupation
i
wandered
about
with
a
book
in
my
hand
for
several
hours
more
thinking
than
reading
for
i
had
many
things
to
think
about
in
the
evening
i
made
use
of
my
liberty
to
go
and
see
my
old
friend
nancy
once
again
to
apologize
for
my
long
absence
which
must
have
seemed
so
neglectful
and
unkind
by
telling
her
how
busy
i
had
been
and
to
talk
or
read
or
work
for
her
whichever
might
be
most
acceptable
and
also
of
course
to
tell
her
the
news
of
this
important
day
and
perhaps
to
obtain
a
little
information
from
her
in
return
respecting
weston
s
expected
departure
but
of
this
she
seemed
to
know
nothing
and
i
hoped
as
she
did
that
it
was
all
a
false
report
she
was
very
glad
to
see
me
but
happily
her
eyes
were
now
so
nearly
well
that
she
was
almost
independent
of
my
services
she
was
deeply
interested
in
the
wedding
but
while
i
amused
her
with
the
details
of
the
festive
day
the
splendours
of
the
bridal
party
and
of
the
bride
herself
she
often
sighed
and
shook
her
head
and
wished
good
might
come
of
it
she
seemed
like
me
to
regard
it
rather
as
a
theme
for
sorrow
than
rejoicing
i
sat
a
long
time
talking
to
her
about
that
and
other
no
one
came
shall
i
confess
that
i
sometimes
looked
towards
the
door
with
a
wish
to
see
it
open
and
give
entrance
to
weston
as
had
happened
once
before
and
that
returning
through
the
lanes
and
fields
i
often
paused
to
look
round
me
and
walked
more
slowly
than
was
at
all
though
a
fine
evening
it
was
not
a
hot
finally
felt
a
sense
of
emptiness
and
disappointment
at
having
reached
the
house
without
meeting
or
even
catching
a
distant
glimpse
of
any
one
except
a
few
labourers
returning
from
their
work
sunday
however
was
approaching
i
should
see
him
then
for
now
that
miss
murray
was
gone
i
could
have
my
old
corner
again
i
should
see
him
and
by
look
speech
and
manner
i
might
judge
whether
the
circumstance
of
her
marriage
had
very
much
afflicted
him
happily
i
could
perceive
no
shadow
of
a
difference
he
wore
the
same
aspect
as
he
had
worn
two
months
look
manner
all
alike
unchanged
there
was
the
same
unclouded
truthfulness
in
his
discourse
the
same
forcible
clearness
in
his
style
the
same
earnest
simplicity
in
all
he
said
and
did
that
made
itself
not
marked
by
the
eye
and
ear
but
felt
upon
the
hearts
of
his
audience
i
walked
home
with
miss
matilda
but
did
not
join
matilda
was
now
sadly
at
a
loss
for
amusement
and
wofully
in
want
of
a
companion
her
brothers
at
school
her
sister
married
and
gone
she
too
young
to
be
admitted
into
society
for
which
from
rosalie
s
example
she
was
in
some
degree
beginning
to
acquire
a
taste
at
least
for
the
company
of
certain
classes
of
gentlemen
at
this
dull
time
of
hunting
going
on
no
shooting
though
she
might
not
join
in
that
it
was
to
see
her
father
or
the
gamekeeper
go
out
with
the
dogs
and
to
talk
with
them
on
their
return
about
the
different
birds
they
had
bagged
now
also
she
was
denied
the
solace
which
the
companionship
of
the
coachman
grooms
horses
greyhounds
and
pointers
might
have
afforded
for
her
mother
having
notwithstanding
the
disadvantages
of
a
country
life
so
satisfactorily
disposed
of
her
elder
daughter
the
pride
of
her
heart
had
begun
seriously
to
turn
her
attention
to
the
younger
and
being
truly
alarmed
at
the
roughness
of
her
manners
and
thinking
it
high
time
to
work
a
reform
had
been
roused
at
length
to
exert
her
authority
and
prohibited
entirely
the
yards
stables
kennels
and
of
course
she
was
not
implicitly
obeyed
but
indulgent
as
she
had
hitherto
been
when
once
her
spirit
was
roused
her
temper
was
not
so
gentle
as
she
required
that
of
her
governesses
to
be
and
her
will
was
not
to
be
thwarted
with
impunity
after
many
a
scene
of
contention
between
mother
and
daughter
many
a
violent
outbreak
which
i
was
ashamed
to
witness
in
which
the
father
s
authority
was
often
called
in
to
confirm
with
oaths
and
threats
the
mother
s
slighted
even
could
see
that
tilly
though
she
would
have
made
a
fine
lad
was
not
quite
what
a
young
lady
ought
to
be
at
length
found
that
her
easiest
plan
was
to
keep
clear
of
the
forbidden
regions
unless
she
could
now
and
then
steal
a
visit
without
her
watchful
mother
s
knowledge
amid
all
this
let
it
not
be
imagined
that
i
escaped
without
many
a
reprimand
and
many
an
implied
reproach
that
lost
none
of
its
sting
from
not
being
openly
worded
but
rather
wounded
the
more
deeply
because
from
that
very
reason
it
seemed
to
preclude
frequently
i
was
told
to
amuse
miss
matilda
with
other
things
and
to
remind
her
of
her
mother
s
precepts
and
prohibitions
i
did
so
to
the
best
of
my
power
but
she
would
not
be
amused
against
her
will
and
could
not
against
her
taste
and
though
i
went
beyond
mere
reminding
such
gentle
remonstrances
as
i
could
use
were
utterly
ineffectual
miss
grey
it
is
the
thing
i
suppose
you
can
t
help
it
if
it
s
not
in
your
i
you
can
t
win
the
confidence
of
that
girl
and
make
your
society
at
as
agreeable
to
her
as
that
of
robert
or
joseph
they
can
talk
the
best
about
the
things
in
which
she
is
most
interested
i
replied
well
that
is
a
strange
confession
to
come
from
her
who
is
to
form
a
young
lady
s
tastes
i
wonder
if
the
governess
doesn
t
do
it
i
have
known
governesses
who
have
so
completely
identified
themselves
with
the
reputation
of
their
young
ladies
for
elegance
and
propriety
in
mind
and
manners
that
they
would
blush
to
speak
a
word
against
them
and
to
hear
the
slightest
blame
imputed
to
their
pupils
was
worse
than
to
be
censured
in
their
own
i
really
think
it
very
natural
for
my
do
you
ma
am
yes
of
course
the
young
lady
s
proficiency
and
elegance
is
of
more
consequence
to
the
governess
than
her
own
as
well
as
to
the
world
if
she
wishes
to
prosper
in
her
vocation
she
must
devote
all
her
energies
to
her
business
all
her
ideas
and
all
her
ambition
will
tend
to
the
accomplishment
of
that
one
object
when
we
wish
to
decide
upon
the
merits
of
a
governess
we
naturally
look
at
the
young
ladies
she
professes
to
have
educated
and
judge
accordingly
the
governess
knows
this
she
knows
that
while
she
lives
in
obscurity
herself
her
pupils
virtues
and
defects
will
be
open
to
every
eye
and
that
unless
she
loses
sight
of
herself
in
their
cultivation
she
need
not
hope
for
success
you
see
miss
grey
it
is
just
the
same
as
any
other
trade
or
profession
they
that
wish
to
prosper
must
devote
themselves
body
and
soul
to
their
calling
and
if
they
begin
to
yield
to
indolence
or
they
are
speedily
distanced
by
wiser
competitors
there
is
little
to
choose
between
a
person
that
ruins
her
pupils
by
neglect
and
one
that
corrupts
them
by
her
example
you
will
excuse
my
dropping
these
little
hints
you
know
it
is
all
for
your
own
good
many
ladies
would
speak
to
you
much
more
strongly
and
many
would
not
trouble
themselves
to
speak
at
all
but
quietly
look
out
for
a
substitute
that
of
course
would
be
the
plan
but
i
know
the
advantages
of
a
place
like
this
to
a
person
in
your
situation
and
i
have
no
desire
to
part
with
you
as
i
am
sure
you
would
do
very
well
if
you
will
only
think
of
these
things
and
try
to
exert
yourself
a
more
then
i
am
convinced
you
would
acquire
that
delicate
tact
which
alone
is
wanting
to
give
you
a
proper
influence
over
the
mind
of
your
i
was
about
to
give
the
lady
some
idea
of
the
fallacy
of
her
expectations
but
she
sailed
away
as
soon
as
she
had
concluded
her
speech
having
said
what
she
wished
it
was
no
part
of
her
plan
to
await
my
answer
it
was
my
business
to
hear
and
not
to
speak
however
as
i
have
said
matilda
at
length
yielded
in
some
degree
to
her
mother
s
authority
pity
it
had
not
been
exerted
before
and
being
thus
deprived
of
almost
every
source
of
amusement
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
take
long
rides
with
the
groom
and
long
walks
with
the
governess
and
to
visit
the
cottages
and
farmhouses
on
her
father
s
estate
to
kill
time
in
chatting
with
the
old
men
and
women
that
inhabited
them
in
one
of
these
walks
it
was
our
chance
to
meet
weston
this
was
what
i
had
long
desired
but
now
for
a
moment
i
wished
either
he
or
i
were
away
i
felt
my
heart
throb
so
violently
that
i
dreaded
lest
some
outward
signs
of
emotion
should
appear
but
i
think
he
hardly
glanced
at
me
and
i
was
soon
calm
enough
after
a
brief
salutation
to
both
he
asked
matilda
if
she
had
lately
heard
from
her
sister
yes
replied
she
she
was
at
paris
when
she
wrote
and
very
well
and
very
she
spoke
the
last
word
emphatically
and
with
a
glance
impertinently
sly
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
but
replied
with
equal
emphasis
and
very
i
hope
she
will
continue
to
be
do
you
think
it
likely
i
ventured
to
inquire
for
matilda
had
started
off
in
pursuit
of
her
dog
that
was
chasing
a
leveret
i
can
not
tell
replied
he
sir
thomas
may
be
a
better
man
than
i
suppose
but
from
all
i
have
heard
and
seen
it
seems
a
pity
that
one
so
young
and
gay
interesting
to
express
many
things
by
one
greatest
if
not
her
only
fault
appears
to
be
trifling
fault
to
be
sure
since
it
renders
the
possessor
liable
to
almost
every
other
and
exposes
him
to
so
many
it
seems
a
pity
that
she
should
be
thrown
away
on
such
a
man
it
was
her
mother
s
wish
i
suppose
yes
and
her
own
too
i
think
for
she
always
laughed
at
my
attempts
to
dissuade
her
from
the
you
did
attempt
it
then
at
least
you
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
it
is
no
fault
of
yours
if
any
harm
should
come
of
it
as
for
murray
i
don
t
know
how
she
can
justify
her
conduct
if
i
had
sufficient
acquaintance
with
her
i
d
ask
it
seems
unnatural
but
some
people
think
rank
and
wealth
the
chief
good
and
if
they
can
secure
that
for
their
children
they
think
they
have
done
their
true
but
is
it
not
strange
that
persons
of
experience
who
have
been
married
themselves
should
judge
so
falsely
matilda
now
came
panting
back
with
the
lacerated
body
of
the
young
hare
in
her
hand
was
it
your
intention
to
kill
that
hare
or
to
save
it
miss
murray
asked
weston
apparently
puzzled
at
her
gleeful
countenance
i
pretended
to
want
to
save
it
she
answered
honestly
enough
as
it
was
so
glaringly
out
of
season
but
i
was
better
pleased
to
see
it
lolled
however
you
can
both
witness
that
i
couldn
t
help
it
prince
was
determined
to
have
her
and
he
clutched
her
by
the
back
and
killed
her
in
a
minute
wasn
t
it
a
noble
chase
very
for
a
young
lady
after
a
there
was
a
quiet
sarcasm
in
the
tone
of
his
reply
which
was
not
lost
upon
her
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
turning
away
with
a
significant
humph
asked
me
how
i
had
enjoyed
the
fun
i
replied
that
i
saw
no
fun
in
the
matter
but
admitted
that
i
had
not
observed
the
transaction
very
narrowly
didn
t
you
see
how
it
like
an
old
hare
and
didn
t
you
hear
it
scream
i
m
happy
to
say
i
did
it
cried
out
just
like
a
poor
little
thing
what
will
you
do
with
it
come
shall
leave
it
in
the
first
house
we
come
to
i
don
t
want
to
take
it
home
for
fear
papa
should
scold
me
for
letting
the
dog
kill
weston
was
now
gone
and
we
too
went
on
our
way
but
as
we
returned
after
having
deposited
the
hare
in
a
and
demolished
some
and
in
exchange
we
met
him
returning
also
from
the
execution
of
his
mission
whatever
it
might
be
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
cluster
of
beautiful
bluebells
which
he
offered
to
me
observing
with
a
smile
that
though
he
had
seen
so
little
of
me
for
the
last
two
months
he
had
not
forgotten
that
bluebells
were
numbered
among
my
favourite
flowers
it
was
done
as
a
simple
act
of
goodwill
without
compliment
or
remarkable
courtesy
or
any
look
that
could
be
construed
into
reverential
tender
adoration
rosalie
murray
but
still
it
was
something
to
find
my
unimportant
saying
so
well
remembered
it
was
something
that
he
had
noticed
so
accurately
the
time
i
had
ceased
to
be
visible
i
was
told
said
he
that
you
were
a
perfect
bookworm
miss
grey
so
completely
absorbed
in
your
studies
that
you
were
lost
to
every
other
yes
and
it
s
quite
true
cried
matilda
no
weston
don
t
believe
it
it
s
a
scandalous
libel
these
young
ladies
are
too
fond
of
making
random
assertions
at
the
expense
of
their
friends
and
you
ought
to
be
careful
how
you
listen
to
i
hope
assertion
is
groundless
at
any
why
do
you
particularly
object
to
ladies
studying
no
but
i
object
to
anyone
so
devoting
himself
or
herself
to
study
as
to
lose
sight
of
everything
else
except
under
peculiar
circumstances
i
consider
very
close
and
constant
study
as
a
waste
of
time
and
an
injury
to
the
mind
as
well
as
the
well
i
have
neither
the
time
nor
the
inclination
for
such
we
parted
again
well
what
is
there
remarkable
in
all
this
why
have
i
recorded
it
because
reader
it
was
important
enough
to
give
me
a
cheerful
evening
a
night
of
pleasing
dreams
and
a
morning
of
felicitous
hopes
cheerfulness
foolish
dreams
unfounded
hopes
you
would
say
and
i
will
not
venture
to
deny
it
suspicions
to
that
effect
arose
too
frequently
in
my
own
mind
but
our
wishes
are
like
tinder
the
flint
and
steel
of
circumstances
are
continually
striking
out
sparks
which
vanish
immediately
unless
they
chance
to
fall
upon
the
tinder
of
our
wishes
then
they
instantly
ignite
and
the
flame
of
hope
is
kindled
in
a
moment
but
alas
that
very
morning
my
flickering
flame
of
hope
was
dismally
quenched
by
a
letter
from
my
mother
which
spoke
so
seriously
of
my
father
s
increasing
illness
that
i
feared
there
was
little
or
no
chance
of
his
recovery
and
close
at
hand
as
the
holidays
were
i
almost
trembled
lest
they
should
come
too
late
for
me
to
meet
him
in
this
world
two
days
after
a
letter
from
mary
told
me
his
life
was
despaired
of
and
his
end
seemed
fast
approaching
then
immediately
i
sought
permission
to
anticipate
the
vacation
and
go
without
delay
murray
stared
and
wondered
at
the
unwonted
energy
and
boldness
with
which
i
urged
the
request
and
thought
there
was
no
occasion
to
hurry
but
finally
gave
me
leave
stating
however
that
there
was
no
need
to
be
in
such
agitation
about
the
might
prove
a
false
alarm
after
all
and
if
it
was
only
in
the
common
course
of
nature
we
must
all
die
some
time
and
i
was
not
to
suppose
myself
the
only
afflicted
person
in
the
world
and
concluding
with
saying
i
might
have
the
phaeton
to
take
me
to
o
and
instead
of
miss
grey
be
thankful
for
the
you
enjoy
there
s
many
a
poor
clergyman
whose
family
would
be
plunged
into
ruin
by
the
event
of
his
death
but
you
you
see
have
influential
friends
ready
to
continue
their
patronage
and
to
show
you
every
i
thanked
her
for
her
consideration
and
flew
to
my
room
to
make
some
hurried
preparations
for
my
departure
my
bonnet
and
shawl
being
on
and
a
few
things
hastily
crammed
into
my
largest
trunk
i
descended
but
i
might
have
done
the
work
more
leisurely
for
no
one
else
was
in
a
hurry
and
i
had
still
a
considerable
time
to
wait
for
the
phaeton
at
length
it
came
to
the
door
and
i
was
off
but
oh
what
a
dreary
journey
was
that
how
utterly
different
from
my
former
passages
homewards
being
too
late
for
the
last
coach
to
i
had
to
hire
a
cab
for
ten
miles
and
then
a
car
to
take
me
over
the
rugged
hills
it
was
ten
before
i
reached
home
they
were
not
in
bed
my
mother
and
sister
both
met
me
in
the
i
was
so
much
shocked
and
that
i
could
not
speak
to
ask
the
information
i
so
much
longed
yet
dreaded
to
obtain
agnes
said
my
mother
struggling
to
repress
some
strong
emotion
oh
agnes
cried
mary
and
burst
into
tears
how
is
he
i
asked
gasping
for
the
answer
dead
it
was
the
reply
i
had
anticipated
but
the
shock
seemed
none
the
less
tremendous
chapter
letter
my
father
s
mortal
remains
had
been
consigned
to
the
tomb
and
we
with
sad
faces
and
sombre
garments
sat
lingering
over
the
frugal
revolving
plans
for
our
future
life
my
mother
s
strong
mind
had
not
given
way
beneath
even
this
affliction
her
spirit
though
crushed
was
not
broken
mary
s
wish
was
that
i
should
go
back
to
horton
lodge
and
that
our
mother
should
come
and
live
with
her
and
richardson
at
the
vicarage
she
affirmed
that
he
wished
it
no
less
than
herself
and
that
such
an
arrangement
could
not
fail
to
benefit
all
parties
for
my
mother
s
society
and
experience
would
be
of
inestimable
value
to
them
and
they
would
do
all
they
could
to
make
her
happy
but
no
arguments
or
entreaties
could
prevail
my
mother
was
determined
not
to
go
not
that
she
questioned
for
a
moment
the
kind
wishes
and
intentions
of
her
daughter
but
she
affirmed
that
so
long
as
god
spared
her
health
and
strength
she
would
make
use
of
them
to
earn
her
own
livelihood
and
be
chargeable
to
no
one
whether
her
dependence
would
be
felt
as
a
burden
or
not
if
she
could
afford
to
reside
as
a
lodger
she
would
choose
that
house
before
all
others
as
the
place
of
her
abode
but
not
being
so
circumstanced
she
would
never
come
under
its
roof
except
as
an
occasional
visitor
unless
sickness
or
calamity
should
render
her
assistance
really
needful
or
until
age
or
infirmity
made
her
incapable
of
maintaining
herself
no
mary
said
she
if
richardson
and
you
have
anything
to
spare
you
must
lay
it
aside
for
your
family
and
agnes
and
i
must
gather
honey
for
ourselves
thanks
to
my
having
had
daughters
to
educate
i
have
not
forgotten
my
accomplishments
god
willing
i
will
check
this
vain
repining
she
said
while
the
tears
coursed
one
another
down
her
cheeks
in
spite
of
her
efforts
but
she
wiped
them
away
and
resolutely
shaking
back
her
head
continued
i
will
exert
myself
and
look
out
for
a
small
house
commodiously
situated
in
some
populous
but
healthy
district
where
we
will
take
a
few
young
ladies
to
board
and
we
can
get
as
many
day
pupils
as
will
come
or
as
we
can
manage
to
instruct
your
father
s
relations
and
old
friends
will
be
able
to
send
us
some
pupils
or
to
assist
us
with
their
recommendations
no
doubt
i
shall
not
apply
to
my
own
what
say
you
to
it
agnes
will
you
be
willing
to
leave
your
present
situation
and
try
quite
willing
mamma
and
the
money
i
have
saved
will
do
to
furnish
the
house
it
shall
be
taken
from
the
bank
when
it
is
wanted
we
must
get
the
house
and
settle
on
preliminaries
mary
offered
to
lend
the
little
she
possessed
but
my
mother
declined
it
saying
that
we
must
begin
on
an
economical
plan
and
she
hoped
that
the
whole
or
part
of
mine
added
to
what
we
could
get
by
the
sale
of
the
furniture
and
what
little
our
dear
papa
had
contrived
to
lay
aside
for
her
since
the
debts
were
paid
would
be
sufficient
to
last
us
till
christmas
when
it
was
hoped
something
would
accrue
from
our
united
labours
it
was
finally
settled
that
this
should
be
our
plan
and
that
inquiries
and
preparations
should
immediately
be
set
on
foot
and
while
my
mother
busied
herself
with
these
i
should
return
to
horton
lodge
at
the
close
of
my
four
weeks
vacation
and
give
notice
for
my
final
departure
when
things
were
in
train
for
the
speedy
commencement
of
our
school
we
were
discussing
these
affairs
on
the
morning
i
have
mentioned
about
a
fortnight
after
my
father
s
death
when
a
letter
was
brought
in
for
my
mother
on
beholding
which
the
colour
mounted
to
her
pale
enough
with
anxious
watchings
and
excessive
sorrow
from
my
father
murmured
she
as
she
hastily
tore
off
the
cover
it
was
many
years
since
she
had
heard
from
any
of
her
own
relations
before
naturally
wondering
what
the
letter
might
contain
i
watched
her
countenance
while
she
read
it
and
was
somewhat
surprised
to
see
her
bite
her
lip
and
knit
her
brows
as
if
in
anger
when
she
had
done
she
somewhat
irreverently
cast
it
on
the
table
saying
with
a
scornful
smile
your
grandpapa
has
been
so
kind
as
to
write
to
me
he
says
he
has
no
doubt
i
have
long
repented
of
my
unfortunate
marriage
and
if
i
will
only
acknowledge
this
and
confess
i
was
wrong
in
neglecting
his
advice
and
that
i
have
justly
suffered
for
it
he
will
make
a
lady
of
me
once
that
be
possible
after
my
long
remember
my
girls
in
his
will
get
my
desk
agnes
and
send
these
things
away
i
will
answer
the
letter
directly
but
first
as
i
may
be
depriving
you
both
of
a
legacy
it
is
just
that
i
should
tell
you
what
i
mean
to
say
i
shall
say
that
he
is
mistaken
in
supposing
that
i
can
regret
the
birth
of
my
daughters
who
have
been
the
pride
of
my
life
and
are
likely
to
be
the
comfort
of
my
old
age
or
the
thirty
years
i
have
passed
in
the
company
of
my
best
and
dearest
friend
had
our
misfortunes
been
three
times
as
great
as
they
were
unless
they
had
been
of
my
bringing
on
i
should
still
the
more
rejoice
to
have
shared
them
with
your
father
and
administered
what
consolation
i
was
able
and
had
his
sufferings
in
illness
been
ten
times
what
they
wore
i
could
not
regret
having
watched
over
and
laboured
to
relieve
them
if
he
had
married
a
richer
wife
misfortunes
and
trials
would
no
doubt
have
come
upon
him
still
while
i
am
egotist
enough
to
imagine
that
no
other
woman
could
have
cheered
him
through
them
so
well
not
that
i
am
superior
to
the
rest
but
i
was
made
for
him
and
he
for
me
and
i
can
no
more
repent
the
hours
days
years
of
happiness
we
have
spent
together
and
which
neither
could
have
had
without
the
other
than
i
can
the
privilege
of
having
been
his
nurse
in
sickness
and
his
comfort
in
affliction
will
this
do
children
shall
i
say
we
are
all
very
sorry
for
what
has
happened
during
the
last
thirty
years
and
my
daughters
wish
they
had
never
been
born
but
since
they
have
had
that
misfortune
they
will
be
thankful
for
any
trifle
their
grandpapa
will
be
kind
enough
to
bestow
of
course
we
both
applauded
our
mother
s
resolution
mary
cleared
away
the
breakfast
things
i
brought
the
desk
the
letter
was
quickly
written
and
despatched
and
from
that
day
we
heard
no
more
of
our
grandfather
till
we
saw
his
death
announced
in
the
newspaper
a
considerable
time
his
worldly
possessions
of
course
being
left
to
our
wealthy
unknown
cousins
chapter
farewell
a
house
in
a
the
fashionable
was
hired
for
our
seminary
and
a
promise
of
two
or
three
pupils
was
obtained
to
commence
with
i
returned
to
horton
lodge
about
the
middle
of
july
leaving
my
mother
to
conclude
the
bargain
for
the
house
to
obtain
more
pupils
to
sell
off
the
furniture
of
our
old
abode
and
to
fit
out
the
new
one
we
often
pity
the
poor
because
they
have
no
leisure
to
mourn
their
departed
relatives
and
necessity
obliges
them
to
labour
through
their
severest
afflictions
but
is
not
active
employment
the
best
remedy
for
overwhelming
surest
antidote
for
despair
it
may
be
a
rough
comforter
it
may
seem
hard
to
be
harassed
with
the
cares
of
life
when
we
have
no
relish
for
its
enjoyments
to
be
goaded
to
labour
when
the
heart
is
ready
to
break
and
the
vexed
spirit
implores
for
rest
only
to
weep
in
silence
but
is
not
labour
better
than
the
rest
we
covet
and
are
not
those
petty
tormenting
cares
less
hurtful
than
a
continual
brooding
over
the
great
affliction
that
oppresses
us
besides
we
can
not
have
cares
and
anxieties
and
toil
without
it
be
but
the
hope
of
fulfilling
our
joyless
task
accomplishing
some
needful
project
or
escaping
some
further
annoyance
at
any
rate
i
was
glad
my
mother
had
so
much
employment
for
every
faculty
of
her
frame
our
kind
neighbours
lamented
that
she
once
so
exalted
in
wealth
and
station
should
be
reduced
to
such
extremity
in
her
time
of
sorrow
but
i
am
persuaded
that
she
would
have
suffered
thrice
as
much
had
she
been
left
in
affluence
with
liberty
to
remain
in
that
house
the
scene
of
her
early
happiness
and
late
affliction
and
no
stern
necessity
to
prevent
her
from
incessantly
brooding
over
and
lamenting
her
bereavement
i
will
not
dilate
upon
the
feelings
with
which
i
left
the
old
house
the
garden
the
little
village
doubly
dear
to
me
because
my
father
who
for
thirty
years
had
taught
and
prayed
within
its
walls
lay
slumbering
now
beneath
its
the
old
bare
hills
delightful
in
their
very
desolation
with
the
narrow
vales
between
smiling
in
green
wood
and
sparkling
house
where
i
was
born
the
scene
of
all
my
early
associations
the
place
where
throughout
life
my
earthly
affections
had
been
centred
left
them
to
return
no
more
true
i
was
going
back
to
horton
lodge
where
amid
many
evils
one
source
of
pleasure
yet
remained
but
it
was
pleasure
mingled
with
excessive
pain
and
my
stay
alas
was
limited
to
six
weeks
and
even
of
that
precious
time
day
after
day
slipped
by
and
i
did
not
see
him
except
at
church
i
never
saw
him
for
a
fortnight
after
my
return
it
seemed
a
long
time
to
me
and
as
i
was
often
out
with
my
rambling
pupil
of
course
hopes
would
keep
rising
and
disappointments
would
ensue
and
then
i
would
say
to
my
own
heart
here
is
a
convincing
you
would
but
have
the
sense
to
see
it
or
the
candour
to
acknowledge
he
does
not
care
for
you
if
he
only
thought
as
much
about
you
as
you
do
about
him
he
would
have
contrived
to
meet
you
many
times
ere
this
you
must
know
that
by
consulting
your
own
feelings
therefore
have
done
with
this
nonsense
you
have
no
ground
for
hope
dismiss
at
once
these
hurtful
thoughts
and
foolish
wishes
from
your
mind
and
turn
to
your
own
duty
and
the
dull
blank
life
that
lies
before
you
you
might
have
known
such
happiness
was
not
for
but
i
saw
him
at
last
he
came
suddenly
upon
me
as
i
was
crossing
a
field
in
returning
from
a
visit
to
nancy
brown
which
i
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
paying
while
matilda
murray
was
riding
her
matchless
mare
he
must
have
heard
of
the
heavy
loss
i
had
sustained
he
expressed
no
sympathy
offered
no
condolence
but
almost
the
first
words
he
uttered
were
how
is
your
mother
and
this
was
no
question
for
i
never
told
him
that
i
had
a
mother
he
must
have
learned
the
fact
from
others
if
he
knew
it
at
all
and
besides
there
was
sincere
goodwill
and
even
deep
touching
unobtrusive
sympathy
in
the
tone
and
manner
of
the
inquiry
i
thanked
him
with
due
civility
and
told
him
she
was
as
well
as
could
be
expected
what
will
she
do
was
the
next
question
many
would
have
deemed
it
an
impertinent
one
and
given
an
evasive
reply
but
such
an
idea
never
entered
my
head
and
i
gave
a
brief
but
plain
statement
of
my
mother
s
plans
and
prospects
then
you
will
leave
this
place
shortly
said
he
yes
in
a
he
paused
a
minute
as
if
in
thought
when
he
spoke
again
i
hoped
it
would
be
to
express
his
concern
at
my
departure
but
it
was
only
to
say
i
should
think
you
will
be
willing
enough
to
go
some
things
i
replied
for
things
wonder
what
should
make
you
regret
it
i
was
annoyed
at
this
in
some
degree
because
it
embarrassed
me
i
had
only
one
reason
for
regretting
it
and
that
was
a
profound
secret
which
he
had
no
business
to
trouble
me
about
why
said
why
should
you
suppose
that
i
dislike
the
place
you
told
me
so
yourself
was
the
decisive
reply
you
said
at
least
that
you
could
not
live
contentedly
without
a
friend
and
that
you
had
no
friend
here
and
no
possibility
of
making
besides
i
know
you
dislike
but
if
you
remember
rightly
i
said
or
meant
to
say
i
could
not
live
contentedly
without
a
friend
in
the
world
i
was
not
so
unreasonable
as
to
require
one
always
near
me
i
think
i
could
be
happy
in
a
house
full
of
enemies
but
no
that
sentence
must
not
be
paused
and
hastily
added
and
besides
we
can
not
well
leave
a
place
where
we
have
lived
for
two
or
three
years
without
some
feeling
of
will
you
regret
to
part
with
miss
murray
your
sole
remaining
pupil
and
companion
i
dare
say
i
shall
in
some
degree
it
was
not
without
sorrow
i
parted
with
her
i
can
imagine
well
miss
matilda
is
quite
as
in
one
what
is
that
she
s
and
the
other
is
not
i
should
not
call
her
but
it
must
be
confessed
she
s
a
little
is
she
saw
she
was
giddy
and
now
he
added
after
a
pause
i
can
well
believe
she
was
artful
too
but
so
excessively
so
as
to
assume
an
aspect
of
extreme
simplicity
and
unguarded
openness
yes
continued
he
musingly
that
accounts
for
some
little
things
that
puzzled
me
a
trifle
after
that
he
turned
the
conversation
to
more
general
subjects
he
did
not
leave
me
till
we
had
nearly
reached
the
he
had
certainly
stepped
a
little
out
of
his
way
to
accompany
me
so
far
for
he
now
went
back
and
disappeared
down
moss
lane
the
entrance
of
which
we
had
passed
some
time
before
assuredly
i
did
not
regret
this
circumstance
if
sorrow
had
any
place
in
my
heart
it
was
that
he
was
gone
at
he
was
no
longer
walking
by
my
side
and
that
that
short
interval
of
delightful
intercourse
was
at
an
end
he
had
not
breathed
a
word
of
love
or
dropped
one
hint
of
tenderness
or
affection
and
yet
i
had
been
supremely
happy
to
be
near
him
to
hear
him
talk
as
he
did
talk
and
to
feel
that
he
thought
me
worthy
to
be
so
spoken
of
understanding
and
duly
appreciating
such
enough
yes
edward
weston
i
could
indeed
be
happy
in
a
house
full
of
enemies
if
i
had
but
one
friend
who
truly
deeply
and
faithfully
loved
me
and
if
that
friend
were
we
might
be
far
to
hear
from
each
other
still
more
seldom
to
toil
and
trouble
and
vexation
might
surround
me
would
be
too
much
happiness
for
me
to
dream
of
yet
who
can
tell
said
i
within
myself
as
i
proceeded
up
the
park
who
can
tell
what
this
one
month
may
bring
forth
i
have
lived
nearly
years
and
i
have
suffered
much
and
tasted
little
pleasure
yet
is
it
likely
my
life
all
through
will
be
so
clouded
is
it
not
possible
that
god
may
hear
my
prayers
disperse
these
gloomy
shadows
and
grant
me
some
beams
of
heaven
s
sunshine
yet
will
he
entirely
deny
to
me
those
blessings
which
are
so
freely
given
to
others
who
neither
ask
them
nor
acknowledge
them
when
received
may
i
not
still
hope
and
trust
i
did
hope
and
trust
for
a
while
but
alas
alas
the
time
ebbed
away
one
week
followed
another
and
excepting
one
distant
glimpse
and
two
transient
which
scarcely
anything
was
i
was
walking
with
miss
matilda
i
saw
nothing
of
him
except
of
course
at
church
and
now
the
last
sunday
was
come
and
the
last
service
i
was
often
on
the
point
of
melting
into
tears
during
the
last
i
was
to
hear
from
him
the
best
i
should
hear
from
anyone
i
was
well
assured
it
was
congregation
were
departing
and
i
must
follow
i
had
then
seen
him
and
heard
his
voice
too
probably
for
the
last
time
in
the
churchyard
matilda
was
pounced
upon
by
the
two
misses
green
they
had
many
inquiries
to
make
about
her
sister
and
i
know
not
what
besides
i
only
wished
they
would
have
done
that
we
might
hasten
back
to
horton
lodge
i
longed
to
seek
the
retirement
of
my
own
room
or
some
sequestered
nook
in
the
grounds
that
i
might
deliver
myself
up
to
my
weep
my
last
farewell
and
lament
my
false
hopes
and
vain
delusions
only
this
once
and
then
adieu
to
fruitless
only
sober
solid
sad
reality
should
occupy
my
mind
but
while
i
thus
resolved
a
low
voice
close
beside
me
i
suppose
you
are
going
this
week
miss
grey
yes
i
replied
i
was
very
much
startled
and
had
i
been
at
all
hysterically
inclined
i
certainly
should
have
committed
myself
in
some
way
then
thank
god
i
was
not
well
said
weston
i
want
to
bid
you
is
not
likely
i
shall
see
you
again
before
you
weston
i
said
oh
how
i
struggled
to
say
it
calmly
i
gave
him
my
hand
he
retained
it
a
few
seconds
in
his
it
is
possible
we
may
meet
again
said
he
will
it
be
of
any
consequence
to
you
whether
we
do
or
not
yes
i
should
be
very
glad
to
see
you
i
say
no
less
he
kindly
pressed
my
hand
and
went
now
i
was
happy
more
inclined
to
burst
into
tears
than
ever
if
i
had
been
forced
to
speak
at
that
moment
a
succession
of
sobs
would
have
inevitably
ensued
and
as
it
was
i
could
not
keep
the
water
out
of
my
eyes
i
walked
along
with
miss
murray
turning
aside
my
face
and
neglecting
to
notice
several
successive
remarks
till
she
bawled
out
that
i
was
either
deaf
or
stupid
and
then
having
recovered
my
as
one
awakened
from
a
fit
of
abstraction
i
suddenly
looked
up
and
asked
what
she
had
been
saying
chapter
school
i
left
horton
lodge
and
went
to
join
my
mother
in
our
new
abode
at
a
i
found
her
well
in
health
resigned
in
spirit
and
even
cheerful
though
subdued
and
sober
in
her
general
demeanour
we
had
only
three
boarders
and
half
a
dozen
to
commence
with
but
by
due
care
and
diligence
we
hoped
ere
long
to
increase
the
number
of
both
i
set
myself
with
befitting
energy
to
discharge
the
duties
of
this
new
mode
of
life
i
call
it
for
there
was
indeed
a
considerable
difference
between
working
with
my
mother
in
a
school
of
our
own
and
working
as
a
hireling
among
strangers
despised
and
trampled
upon
by
old
and
young
and
for
the
first
few
weeks
i
was
by
no
means
unhappy
it
is
possible
we
may
meet
again
and
will
it
be
of
any
consequence
to
you
whether
we
do
or
not
words
still
rang
in
my
ear
and
rested
on
my
heart
they
were
my
secret
solace
and
support
i
shall
see
him
will
come
or
he
will
no
promise
in
fact
was
too
bright
or
too
extravagant
for
hope
to
whisper
in
my
ear
i
did
not
believe
half
of
what
she
told
me
i
pretended
to
laugh
at
it
all
but
i
was
far
more
credulous
than
i
myself
supposed
otherwise
why
did
my
heart
leap
up
when
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
front
door
and
the
maid
who
opened
it
came
to
tell
my
mother
a
gentleman
wished
to
see
her
and
why
was
i
out
of
humour
for
the
rest
of
the
day
because
it
proved
to
be
a
come
to
offer
his
services
to
our
school
and
what
stopped
my
breath
for
a
moment
when
the
postman
having
brought
a
couple
of
letters
my
mother
said
here
agnes
this
is
for
you
and
threw
one
of
them
to
me
and
what
made
the
hot
blood
rush
into
my
face
when
i
saw
it
was
directed
in
a
gentleman
s
hand
and
why
did
that
cold
sickening
sense
of
disappointment
fall
upon
me
when
i
had
torn
open
the
cover
and
found
it
was
a
letter
from
mary
which
for
some
reason
or
other
her
husband
had
directed
for
her
was
it
then
come
to
i
should
be
to
receive
a
letter
from
my
only
sister
and
because
it
was
not
written
by
a
comparative
stranger
dear
mary
and
she
had
written
it
so
thinking
i
should
be
so
pleased
to
have
it
was
not
worthy
to
read
it
and
i
believe
in
my
indignation
against
myself
i
should
have
put
it
aside
till
i
had
schooled
myself
into
a
better
frame
of
mind
and
was
become
more
deserving
of
the
honour
and
privilege
of
its
perusal
but
there
was
my
mother
looking
on
and
wishful
to
know
what
news
it
contained
so
i
read
it
and
delivered
it
to
her
and
then
went
into
the
schoolroom
to
attend
to
the
pupils
but
amidst
the
cares
of
copies
and
the
intervals
of
correcting
errors
here
and
reproving
derelictions
of
duty
there
i
was
inwardly
taking
myself
to
task
with
far
sterner
severity
what
a
fool
you
must
be
said
my
head
to
my
heart
or
my
sterner
to
my
softer
self
how
could
you
ever
dream
that
he
would
write
to
you
what
grounds
have
you
for
such
a
that
he
will
see
you
or
give
himself
any
trouble
about
even
think
of
you
again
what
grounds
then
hope
set
before
me
that
last
short
interview
and
repeated
the
words
i
had
so
faithfully
treasured
in
my
memory
well
and
what
was
there
in
that
ever
hung
his
hopes
upon
so
frail
a
twig
what
was
there
in
those
words
that
any
common
acquaintance
might
not
say
to
another
of
course
it
was
possible
you
might
meet
again
he
might
have
said
so
if
you
had
been
going
to
new
zealand
but
that
did
not
imply
any
of
seeing
then
as
to
the
question
that
followed
anyone
might
ask
that
and
how
did
you
answer
with
a
stupid
commonplace
reply
such
as
you
would
have
given
to
master
murray
or
anyone
else
you
had
been
on
tolerably
civil
terms
but
then
persisted
hope
the
tone
and
manner
in
which
he
oh
that
is
nonsense
he
always
speaks
impressively
and
at
that
moment
there
were
the
greens
and
miss
matilda
murray
just
before
and
other
people
passing
by
and
he
was
obliged
to
stand
close
beside
you
and
to
speak
very
low
unless
he
wished
everybody
to
hear
what
he
said
it
was
nothing
at
all
course
he
would
rather
but
then
above
all
that
emphatic
yet
gentle
pressure
of
the
hand
which
seemed
to
say
me
and
many
other
things
delightful
almost
too
flattering
to
be
repeated
even
to
one
s
self
egregious
absurd
to
require
inventions
of
the
imagination
which
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
if
you
would
but
consider
your
own
unattractive
exterior
your
unamiable
reserve
your
foolish
must
make
you
appear
cold
dull
awkward
and
perhaps
too
you
had
but
rightly
considered
these
from
the
beginning
you
would
never
have
harboured
such
presumptuous
thoughts
and
now
that
you
have
been
so
foolish
pray
repent
and
amend
and
let
us
have
no
more
of
it
i
can
not
say
that
i
implicitly
obeyed
my
own
injunctions
but
such
reasoning
as
this
became
more
and
more
effective
as
time
wore
on
and
nothing
was
seen
or
heard
of
weston
until
at
last
i
gave
up
hoping
for
even
my
heart
acknowledged
it
was
all
in
vain
but
still
i
would
think
of
him
i
would
cherish
his
image
in
my
mind
and
treasure
every
word
look
and
gesture
that
my
memory
could
retain
and
brood
over
his
excellences
and
his
peculiarities
and
in
fact
all
i
had
seen
heard
or
imagined
respecting
him
agnes
this
sea
air
and
change
of
scene
do
you
no
good
i
think
i
never
saw
you
look
so
wretched
it
must
be
that
you
sit
too
much
and
allow
the
cares
of
the
schoolroom
to
worry
you
you
must
learn
to
take
things
easy
and
to
be
more
active
and
cheerful
you
must
take
exercise
whenever
you
can
get
it
and
leave
the
most
tiresome
duties
to
me
they
will
only
serve
to
exercise
my
patience
and
perhaps
try
my
temper
a
so
said
my
mother
as
we
sat
at
work
one
morning
during
the
easter
holidays
i
assured
her
that
my
employments
were
not
at
all
oppressive
that
i
was
well
or
if
there
was
anything
amiss
it
would
be
gone
as
soon
as
the
trying
months
of
spring
were
over
when
summer
came
i
should
be
as
strong
and
hearty
as
she
could
wish
to
see
me
but
inwardly
her
observation
startled
me
i
knew
my
strength
was
declining
my
appetite
had
failed
and
i
was
grown
listless
and
desponding
if
indeed
he
could
never
care
for
me
and
i
could
never
see
him
i
was
forbidden
to
minister
to
his
for
ever
to
taste
the
joys
of
love
to
bless
and
to
be
life
must
be
a
burden
and
if
my
heavenly
father
would
call
me
away
i
should
be
glad
to
rest
but
it
would
not
do
to
die
and
leave
my
mother
selfish
unworthy
daughter
to
forget
her
for
a
moment
was
not
her
happiness
committed
in
a
great
measure
to
my
charge
the
welfare
of
our
young
pupils
too
should
i
shrink
from
the
work
that
god
had
set
before
me
because
it
was
not
fitted
to
my
taste
did
not
he
know
best
what
i
should
do
and
where
i
ought
to
labour
should
i
long
to
quit
his
service
before
i
had
finished
my
task
and
expect
to
enter
into
his
rest
without
having
laboured
to
earn
it
no
by
his
help
i
will
arise
and
address
myself
diligently
to
my
appointed
duty
if
happiness
in
this
world
is
not
for
me
i
will
endeavour
to
promote
the
welfare
of
those
around
me
and
my
reward
shall
be
so
said
i
in
my
heart
and
from
that
hour
i
only
permitted
my
thoughts
to
wander
to
edward
at
least
to
dwell
upon
him
now
and
a
treat
for
rare
occasions
and
whether
it
was
really
the
approach
of
summer
or
the
effect
of
these
good
resolutions
or
the
lapse
of
time
or
all
together
tranquillity
of
mind
was
soon
restored
and
bodily
health
and
vigour
began
likewise
slowly
but
surely
to
return
early
in
june
i
received
a
letter
from
lady
ashby
late
miss
murray
she
had
written
to
me
twice
or
thrice
before
from
the
different
stages
of
her
bridal
tour
always
in
good
spirits
and
professing
to
be
very
happy
i
wondered
every
time
that
she
had
not
forgotten
me
in
the
midst
of
so
much
gaiety
and
variety
of
scene
at
length
however
there
was
a
pause
and
it
seemed
she
had
forgotten
me
for
upwards
of
seven
months
passed
away
and
no
letter
of
course
i
did
not
break
my
heart
about
though
i
often
wondered
how
she
was
getting
on
and
when
this
last
epistle
so
unexpectedly
arrived
i
was
glad
enough
to
receive
it
it
was
dated
from
ashby
park
where
she
was
come
to
settle
down
at
last
having
previously
divided
her
time
between
the
continent
and
the
metropolis
she
made
many
apologies
for
having
neglected
me
so
long
assured
me
she
had
not
forgotten
me
and
had
often
intended
to
write
but
had
always
been
prevented
by
something
she
acknowledged
that
she
had
been
leading
a
very
dissipated
life
and
i
should
think
her
very
wicked
and
very
thoughtless
but
notwithstanding
that
she
thought
a
great
deal
and
among
other
things
that
she
should
vastly
like
to
see
me
we
have
been
several
days
here
already
wrote
she
we
have
not
a
single
friend
with
us
and
are
likely
to
be
very
dull
you
know
i
never
had
a
fancy
for
living
with
my
husband
like
two
turtles
in
a
nest
were
he
the
most
delightful
creature
that
ever
wore
a
coat
so
do
take
pity
upon
me
and
come
i
suppose
your
midsummer
holidays
commence
in
june
the
same
as
other
people
s
therefore
you
can
not
plead
want
of
time
and
you
must
and
shall
fact
i
shall
die
if
you
don
t
i
want
you
to
visit
me
as
a
friend
and
stay
a
long
time
there
is
nobody
with
me
as
i
told
you
before
but
sir
thomas
and
old
lady
ashby
but
you
needn
t
mind
ll
trouble
us
but
little
with
their
company
and
you
shall
have
a
room
to
yourself
whenever
you
like
to
retire
to
it
and
plenty
of
books
to
read
when
my
company
is
not
sufficiently
amusing
i
forget
whether
you
like
babies
if
you
do
you
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
most
charming
child
in
the
world
no
doubt
and
all
the
more
so
that
i
am
not
troubled
with
nursing
was
determined
i
wouldn
t
be
bothered
with
that
unfortunately
it
is
a
girl
and
sir
thomas
has
never
forgiven
me
but
however
if
you
will
only
come
i
promise
you
shall
be
its
governess
as
soon
as
it
can
speak
and
you
shall
bring
it
up
in
the
way
it
should
go
and
make
a
better
woman
of
it
than
its
mamma
and
you
shall
see
my
poodle
too
a
splendid
little
charmer
imported
from
paris
and
two
fine
italian
paintings
of
great
forget
the
artist
doubtless
you
will
be
able
to
discover
prodigious
beauties
in
them
which
you
must
point
out
to
me
as
i
only
admire
by
hearsay
and
many
elegant
curiosities
besides
which
i
purchased
at
rome
and
elsewhere
and
finally
you
shall
see
my
new
splendid
house
and
grounds
i
used
to
covet
so
greatly
alas
how
far
the
promise
of
anticipation
exceeds
the
pleasure
of
possession
there
s
a
fine
sentiment
i
assure
you
i
am
become
quite
a
grave
old
matron
pray
come
if
it
be
only
to
witness
the
wonderful
change
write
by
return
of
post
and
tell
me
when
your
vacation
commences
and
say
that
you
will
come
the
day
after
and
stay
till
the
day
before
it
mercy
to
yours
affectionately
rosalie
i
showed
this
strange
epistle
to
my
mother
and
consulted
her
on
what
i
ought
to
do
she
advised
me
to
go
and
i
enough
to
see
lady
ashby
and
her
baby
too
and
to
do
anything
i
could
to
benefit
her
by
consolation
or
advice
for
i
imagined
she
must
be
unhappy
or
she
would
not
have
applied
to
me
feeling
as
may
readily
be
conceived
that
in
accepting
the
invitation
i
made
a
great
sacrifice
for
her
and
did
violence
to
my
feelings
in
many
ways
instead
of
being
delighted
with
the
honourable
distinction
of
being
entreated
by
the
baronet
s
lady
to
visit
her
as
a
friend
however
i
determined
my
visit
should
be
only
for
a
few
days
at
most
and
i
will
not
deny
that
i
derived
some
consolation
from
the
idea
that
as
ashby
park
was
not
very
far
from
horton
i
might
possibly
see
weston
or
at
least
hear
something
about
him
chapter
visit
ashby
park
was
certainly
a
very
delightful
residence
the
mansion
was
stately
without
commodious
and
elegant
within
the
park
was
spacious
and
beautiful
chiefly
on
account
of
its
magnificent
old
trees
its
stately
herds
of
deer
its
broad
sheet
of
water
and
the
ancient
woods
that
stretched
beyond
it
for
there
was
no
broken
ground
to
give
variety
to
the
landscape
and
but
very
little
of
that
undulating
swell
which
adds
so
greatly
to
the
charm
of
park
scenery
and
so
this
was
the
place
rosalie
murray
had
so
longed
to
call
her
own
that
she
must
have
a
share
of
it
on
whatever
terms
it
might
be
price
was
to
be
paid
for
the
title
of
mistress
and
whoever
was
to
be
her
partner
in
the
honour
and
bliss
of
such
a
possession
well
i
am
not
disposed
to
censure
her
now
she
received
me
very
kindly
and
though
i
was
a
poor
clergyman
s
daughter
a
governess
and
a
schoolmistress
she
welcomed
me
with
unaffected
pleasure
to
her
home
surprised
me
some
pains
to
make
my
visit
agreeable
i
could
see
it
is
true
that
she
expected
me
to
be
greatly
struck
with
the
magnificence
that
surrounded
her
and
i
confess
i
was
rather
annoyed
at
her
evident
efforts
to
reassure
me
and
prevent
me
from
being
overwhelmed
by
so
much
much
awed
at
the
idea
of
encountering
her
husband
and
or
too
much
ashamed
of
my
own
humble
appearance
i
was
not
ashamed
of
it
at
all
for
though
plain
i
had
taken
good
care
not
to
be
shabby
or
mean
and
should
have
been
pretty
considerably
at
my
ease
if
my
condescending
hostess
had
not
taken
such
manifest
pains
to
make
me
so
and
as
for
the
magnificence
that
surrounded
her
nothing
that
met
my
eyes
struck
me
or
affected
me
half
so
much
as
her
own
altered
appearance
whether
from
the
influence
of
fashionable
dissipation
or
some
other
evil
a
space
of
little
more
than
twelve
months
had
had
the
effect
that
might
be
expected
from
as
many
years
in
reducing
the
plumpness
of
her
form
the
freshness
of
her
complexion
the
vivacity
of
her
movements
and
the
exuberance
of
her
spirits
i
wished
to
know
if
she
was
unhappy
but
i
felt
it
was
not
my
province
to
inquire
i
might
endeavour
to
win
her
confidence
but
if
she
chose
to
conceal
her
matrimonial
cares
from
me
i
would
trouble
her
with
no
obtrusive
questions
i
therefore
at
first
confined
myself
to
a
few
general
inquiries
about
her
health
and
welfare
and
a
few
commendations
on
the
beauty
of
the
park
and
of
the
little
girl
that
should
have
been
a
boy
a
small
delicate
infant
of
seven
or
eight
weeks
old
whom
its
mother
seemed
to
regard
with
no
remarkable
degree
of
interest
or
affection
though
full
as
much
as
i
expected
her
to
show
shortly
after
my
arrival
she
commissioned
her
maid
to
conduct
me
to
my
room
and
see
that
i
had
everything
i
wanted
it
was
a
small
unpretending
but
sufficiently
comfortable
apartment
when
i
descended
divested
myself
of
all
travelling
encumbrances
and
arranged
my
toilet
with
due
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
my
lady
hostess
she
conducted
me
herself
to
the
room
i
was
to
occupy
when
i
chose
to
be
alone
or
when
she
was
engaged
with
visitors
or
obliged
to
be
with
her
or
otherwise
prevented
as
she
said
from
enjoying
the
pleasure
of
my
society
it
was
a
quiet
tidy
little
and
i
was
not
sorry
to
be
provided
with
such
a
harbour
of
refuge
and
some
time
said
she
i
will
show
you
the
library
i
never
examined
its
shelves
but
i
daresay
it
is
full
of
wise
books
and
you
may
go
and
burrow
among
them
whenever
you
please
and
now
you
shall
have
some
will
soon
be
but
i
thought
as
you
were
accustomed
to
dine
at
one
you
would
perhaps
like
better
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
about
this
time
and
to
dine
when
we
lunch
and
then
you
know
you
can
have
your
tea
in
this
room
and
that
will
save
you
from
having
to
dine
with
lady
ashby
and
sir
thomas
which
would
be
rather
least
not
awkward
but
know
what
i
mean
i
thought
you
mightn
t
like
it
so
as
we
may
have
other
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
dine
with
us
certainly
said
i
i
would
much
rather
have
it
as
you
say
and
if
you
have
no
objection
i
should
prefer
having
all
my
meals
in
this
why
so
because
i
imagine
it
would
be
more
agreeable
to
lady
ashby
and
sir
nothing
of
the
at
any
rate
it
would
be
more
agreeable
to
she
made
some
faint
objections
but
soon
conceded
and
i
could
see
that
the
proposal
was
a
considerable
relief
to
her
now
come
into
the
said
she
there
s
the
dressing
bell
but
i
won
t
go
yet
it
s
no
use
dressing
when
there
s
no
one
to
see
you
and
i
want
to
have
a
little
the
was
certainly
an
imposing
apartment
and
very
elegantly
furnished
but
i
saw
its
young
mistress
glance
towards
me
as
we
entered
as
if
to
notice
how
i
was
impressed
by
the
spectacle
and
accordingly
i
determined
to
preserve
an
aspect
of
stony
indifference
as
if
i
saw
nothing
at
all
remarkable
but
this
was
only
for
a
moment
immediately
conscience
whispered
why
should
i
disappoint
her
to
save
my
pride
let
me
sacrifice
my
pride
to
give
her
a
little
innocent
and
i
honestly
looked
round
and
told
her
it
was
a
noble
room
and
very
tastefully
furnished
she
said
little
but
i
saw
she
was
pleased
she
showed
me
her
fat
french
poodle
that
lay
curled
up
on
a
silk
cushion
and
the
two
fine
italian
paintings
which
however
she
would
not
give
me
time
to
examine
but
saying
i
must
look
at
them
some
other
day
insisted
upon
my
admiring
the
little
jewelled
watch
she
had
purchased
in
geneva
and
then
she
took
me
round
the
room
to
point
out
sundry
articles
of
she
had
brought
from
italy
an
elegant
little
timepiece
and
several
busts
small
graceful
figures
and
vases
all
beautifully
carved
in
white
marble
she
spoke
of
these
with
animation
and
heard
my
admiring
comments
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
that
soon
however
vanished
and
was
followed
by
a
melancholy
sigh
as
if
in
consideration
of
the
insufficiency
of
all
such
baubles
to
the
happiness
of
the
human
heart
and
their
woeful
inability
to
supply
its
insatiate
demands
then
stretching
herself
upon
a
couch
she
motioned
me
to
a
capacious
that
stood
before
the
fire
but
before
a
wide
open
window
for
it
was
summer
be
it
remembered
a
sweet
warm
evening
in
the
latter
half
of
june
i
sat
for
a
moment
in
silence
enjoying
the
still
pure
air
and
the
delightful
prospect
of
the
park
that
lay
before
me
rich
in
verdure
and
foliage
and
basking
in
yellow
sunshine
relieved
by
the
long
shadows
of
declining
day
but
i
must
take
advantage
of
this
pause
i
had
inquiries
to
make
and
like
the
substance
of
a
lady
s
postscript
the
most
important
must
come
last
so
i
began
with
asking
after
and
murray
and
miss
matilda
and
the
young
gentlemen
i
was
told
that
papa
had
the
gout
which
made
him
very
ferocious
and
that
he
would
not
give
up
his
choice
wines
and
his
substantial
dinners
and
suppers
and
had
quarrelled
with
his
physician
because
the
latter
had
dared
to
say
that
no
medicine
could
cure
him
while
he
lived
so
freely
that
mamma
and
the
rest
were
well
matilda
was
still
wild
and
reckless
but
she
had
got
a
fashionable
governess
and
was
considerably
improved
in
her
manners
and
soon
to
be
introduced
to
the
world
and
john
and
charles
now
at
home
for
the
holidays
were
by
all
accounts
fine
bold
unruly
mischievous
and
how
are
the
other
people
getting
on
said
the
greens
for
instance
ah
green
is
you
know
replied
she
with
a
languid
smile
he
hasn
t
got
over
his
disappointment
yet
and
never
will
i
suppose
he
s
doomed
to
be
an
old
bachelor
and
his
sisters
are
doing
their
best
to
get
and
the
melthams
oh
they
re
jogging
on
as
usual
i
suppose
but
i
know
very
little
about
any
of
harry
said
she
blushing
slightly
and
smiling
again
i
saw
a
great
deal
of
him
while
we
were
in
london
for
as
soon
as
he
heard
we
were
there
he
came
up
under
pretence
of
visiting
his
brother
and
either
followed
me
like
a
shadow
wherever
i
went
or
met
me
like
a
reflection
at
every
turn
you
needn
t
look
so
shocked
miss
grey
i
was
very
discreet
i
assure
you
but
you
know
one
can
t
help
being
admired
poor
fellow
he
was
not
my
only
worshipper
though
he
was
certainly
the
most
conspicuous
and
i
think
the
most
devoted
among
them
all
and
that
sir
thomas
chose
to
take
offence
at
my
profuse
expenditure
or
don
t
exactly
know
hurried
me
down
to
the
country
at
a
moment
s
notice
where
i
m
to
play
the
hermit
i
suppose
for
and
she
bit
her
lip
and
frowned
vindictively
upon
the
fair
domain
she
had
once
so
coveted
to
call
her
own
and
hatfield
said
i
what
is
become
of
him
again
she
brightened
up
and
answered
oh
he
made
up
to
an
elderly
spinster
and
married
her
not
long
since
weighing
her
heavy
purse
against
her
faded
charms
and
expecting
to
find
that
solace
in
gold
which
was
denied
him
in
ha
well
and
i
think
that
s
weston
what
is
he
doing
i
don
t
know
i
m
sure
he
s
gone
from
how
long
since
and
where
is
he
gone
to
i
know
nothing
about
him
replied
she
except
that
he
went
about
a
month
never
asked
where
i
would
have
asked
whether
it
was
to
a
living
or
merely
another
curacy
but
thought
it
better
not
and
the
people
made
a
great
rout
about
his
leaving
continued
she
much
to
hatfield
s
displeasure
for
hatfield
didn
t
like
him
because
he
had
too
much
influence
with
the
common
people
and
because
he
was
not
sufficiently
tractable
and
submissive
to
for
some
other
unpardonable
sins
i
don
t
know
what
but
now
i
positively
must
go
and
dress
the
second
bell
will
ring
directly
and
if
i
come
to
dinner
in
this
guise
i
shall
never
hear
the
end
of
it
from
lady
ashby
it
s
a
strange
thing
one
can
t
be
mistress
in
one
s
own
house
just
ring
the
bell
and
i
ll
send
for
my
maid
and
tell
them
to
get
you
some
tea
only
think
of
that
intolerable
maid
no
my
unfortunate
mistake
instead
of
letting
her
take
herself
off
to
some
other
house
as
she
offered
to
do
when
i
married
i
was
fool
enough
to
ask
her
to
live
here
still
and
direct
the
affairs
of
the
house
for
me
because
in
the
first
place
i
hoped
we
should
spend
the
greater
part
of
the
year
in
town
and
in
the
second
place
being
so
young
and
inexperienced
i
was
frightened
at
the
idea
of
having
a
houseful
of
servants
to
manage
and
dinners
to
order
and
parties
to
entertain
and
all
the
rest
of
it
and
i
thought
she
might
assist
me
with
her
experience
never
dreaming
she
would
prove
a
usurper
a
tyrant
an
incubus
a
spy
and
everything
else
that
s
detestable
i
wish
she
was
dead
she
then
turned
to
give
her
orders
to
the
footman
who
had
been
standing
bolt
upright
within
the
door
for
the
last
half
minute
and
had
heard
the
latter
part
of
her
animadversions
and
of
course
made
his
own
reflections
upon
them
notwithstanding
the
inflexible
wooden
countenance
he
thought
proper
to
preserve
in
the
on
my
remarking
afterwards
that
he
must
have
heard
her
she
oh
no
matter
i
never
care
about
the
footmen
they
re
mere
automatons
it
s
nothing
to
them
what
their
superiors
say
or
do
they
won
t
dare
to
repeat
it
and
as
to
what
they
they
presume
to
think
at
course
nobody
cares
for
that
it
would
be
a
pretty
thing
indeed
it
we
were
to
be
by
our
servants
so
saying
she
ran
off
to
make
her
hasty
toilet
leaving
me
to
pilot
my
way
back
to
my
where
in
due
time
i
was
served
with
a
cup
of
tea
after
that
i
sat
musing
on
lady
ashby
s
past
and
present
condition
and
on
what
little
information
i
had
obtained
respecting
weston
and
the
small
chance
there
was
of
ever
seeing
or
hearing
anything
more
of
him
throughout
my
quiet
life
which
henceforth
seemed
to
offer
no
alternative
between
positive
rainy
days
and
days
of
dull
grey
clouds
without
downfall
at
length
however
i
began
to
weary
of
my
thoughts
and
to
wish
i
knew
where
to
find
the
library
my
hostess
had
spoken
of
and
to
wonder
whether
i
was
to
remain
there
doing
nothing
till
as
i
was
not
rich
enough
to
possess
a
watch
i
could
not
tell
how
time
was
passing
except
by
observing
the
slowly
lengthening
shadows
from
the
window
which
presented
a
side
view
including
a
corner
of
the
park
a
clump
of
trees
whose
topmost
branches
had
been
colonized
by
an
innumerable
company
of
noisy
rooks
and
a
high
wall
with
a
massive
wooden
gate
no
doubt
communicating
with
the
as
a
broad
swept
up
to
it
from
the
park
the
shadow
of
this
wall
soon
took
possession
of
the
whole
of
the
ground
as
far
as
i
could
see
forcing
the
golden
sunlight
to
retreat
inch
by
inch
and
at
last
take
refuge
in
the
very
tops
of
the
trees
ere
long
even
they
were
left
in
shadow
of
the
distant
hills
or
of
the
earth
itself
and
in
sympathy
for
the
busy
citizens
of
the
rookery
i
regretted
to
see
their
habitation
so
lately
bathed
in
glorious
light
reduced
to
the
sombre
hue
of
the
lower
world
or
of
my
own
world
within
for
a
moment
such
birds
as
soared
above
the
rest
might
still
receive
the
lustre
on
their
wings
which
imparted
to
their
sable
plumage
the
hue
and
brilliance
of
deep
red
gold
at
last
that
too
departed
twilight
came
stealing
on
the
rooks
became
more
quiet
i
became
more
weary
and
wished
i
were
going
home
at
length
it
grew
dark
and
i
was
thinking
of
ringing
for
a
candle
and
betaking
myself
to
bed
when
my
hostess
appeared
with
many
apologies
for
having
neglected
me
so
long
and
laying
all
the
blame
upon
that
nasty
old
woman
as
she
called
her
if
i
didn
t
sit
with
her
in
the
while
sir
thomas
is
taking
his
wine
said
she
she
would
never
forgive
me
and
then
if
i
leave
the
room
the
instant
he
i
have
done
once
or
is
an
unpardonable
offence
against
her
dear
thomas
never
showed
such
disrespect
to
husband
and
as
for
affection
wives
never
think
of
that
she
supposes
but
things
were
different
in
if
there
was
any
good
to
be
done
by
staying
in
the
room
when
he
does
nothing
but
grumble
and
scold
when
he
s
in
a
bad
humour
talk
disgusting
nonsense
when
he
s
in
a
good
one
and
go
to
sleep
on
the
sofa
when
he
s
too
stupid
for
either
which
is
most
frequently
the
case
now
when
he
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
sot
over
his
but
could
you
not
try
to
occupy
his
mind
with
something
better
and
engage
him
to
give
up
such
habits
i
m
sure
you
have
powers
of
persuasion
and
qualifications
for
amusing
a
gentleman
which
many
ladies
would
be
glad
to
and
so
you
think
i
would
lay
myself
out
for
his
amusement
no
that
s
not
idea
of
a
wife
it
s
the
husband
s
part
to
please
the
wife
not
hers
to
please
him
and
if
he
isn
t
satisfied
with
her
as
she
thankful
to
possess
her
isn
t
worthy
of
her
that
s
all
and
as
for
persuasion
i
assure
you
i
shan
t
trouble
myself
with
that
i
ve
enough
to
do
to
bear
with
him
as
he
is
without
attempting
to
work
a
reform
but
i
m
sorry
i
left
you
so
long
alone
miss
grey
how
have
you
passed
the
time
chiefly
in
watching
the
mercy
how
dull
you
must
have
been
i
really
must
show
you
the
library
and
you
must
ring
for
everything
you
want
just
as
you
would
in
an
inn
and
make
yourself
comfortable
i
have
selfish
reasons
for
wishing
to
make
you
happy
because
i
want
you
to
stay
with
me
and
not
fulfil
your
horrid
threat
of
running
away
in
a
day
or
well
don
t
let
me
keep
you
out
of
the
any
longer
for
at
present
i
am
tired
and
wish
to
go
to
chapter
park
i
came
down
a
little
before
eight
next
morning
as
i
knew
by
the
striking
of
a
distant
clock
there
was
no
appearance
of
breakfast
i
waited
above
an
hour
before
it
came
still
vainly
longing
for
access
to
the
library
and
after
that
lonely
repast
was
concluded
i
waited
again
about
an
hour
and
a
half
in
great
suspense
and
discomfort
uncertain
what
to
do
at
length
lady
ashby
came
to
bid
me
she
informed
me
she
had
only
just
breakfasted
and
now
wanted
me
to
take
an
early
walk
with
her
in
the
park
she
asked
how
long
i
had
been
up
and
on
receiving
my
answer
expressed
the
deepest
regret
and
again
promised
to
show
me
the
library
i
suggested
she
had
better
do
so
at
once
and
then
there
would
be
no
further
trouble
either
with
remembering
or
forgetting
she
complied
on
condition
that
i
would
not
think
of
reading
or
bothering
with
the
books
now
for
she
wanted
to
show
me
the
gardens
and
take
a
walk
in
the
park
with
me
before
it
became
too
hot
for
enjoyment
which
indeed
was
nearly
the
case
already
of
course
i
readily
assented
and
we
took
our
walk
accordingly
as
we
were
strolling
in
the
park
talking
of
what
my
companion
had
seen
and
heard
during
her
travelling
experience
a
gentleman
on
horseback
rode
up
and
passed
us
as
he
turned
in
passing
and
stared
me
full
in
the
face
i
had
a
good
opportunity
of
seeing
what
he
was
like
he
was
tall
thin
and
wasted
with
a
slight
stoop
in
the
shoulders
a
pale
face
but
somewhat
blotchy
and
disagreeably
red
about
the
eyelids
plain
features
and
a
general
appearance
of
languor
and
flatness
relieved
by
a
sinister
expression
in
the
mouth
and
the
dull
soulless
eyes
i
detest
that
man
whispered
lady
ashby
with
bitter
emphasis
as
he
slowly
trotted
by
who
is
it
i
asked
unwilling
to
suppose
that
she
should
so
speak
of
her
husband
sir
thomas
ashby
she
replied
with
dreary
composure
and
do
you
him
miss
murray
said
i
for
i
was
too
much
shocked
to
remember
her
name
at
the
moment
yes
i
do
miss
grey
and
despise
him
too
and
if
you
knew
him
you
would
not
blame
but
you
knew
what
he
was
before
you
married
no
i
only
thought
so
i
did
not
half
know
him
really
i
know
you
warned
me
against
it
and
i
wish
i
had
listened
to
you
but
it
s
too
late
to
regret
that
now
and
besides
mamma
ought
to
have
known
better
than
either
of
us
and
she
never
said
anything
against
the
contrary
and
then
i
thought
he
adored
me
and
would
let
me
have
my
own
way
he
did
pretend
to
do
so
at
first
but
now
he
does
not
care
a
bit
about
me
yet
i
should
not
care
for
that
he
might
do
as
he
pleased
if
i
might
only
be
free
to
amuse
myself
and
to
stay
in
london
or
have
a
few
friends
down
here
but
do
as
he
pleases
and
i
must
be
a
prisoner
and
a
slave
the
moment
he
saw
i
could
enjoy
myself
without
him
and
that
others
knew
my
value
better
than
himself
the
selfish
wretch
began
to
accuse
me
of
coquetry
and
extravagance
and
to
abuse
harry
meltham
whose
shoes
he
was
not
worthy
to
clean
and
then
he
must
needs
have
me
down
in
the
country
to
lead
the
life
of
a
nun
lest
i
should
dishonour
him
or
bring
him
to
ruin
as
if
he
had
not
been
ten
times
worse
every
way
with
his
and
his
and
his
and
his
lady
this
and
and
his
bottles
of
wine
and
glasses
of
too
oh
i
would
give
ten
thousand
worlds
to
be
miss
murray
again
it
is
bad
to
feel
life
health
and
beauty
wasting
away
unfelt
and
unenjoyed
for
such
a
brute
as
that
exclaimed
she
fairly
bursting
into
tears
in
the
bitterness
of
her
vexation
of
course
i
pitied
her
exceedingly
as
well
for
her
false
idea
of
happiness
and
disregard
of
duty
as
for
the
wretched
partner
with
whom
her
fate
was
linked
i
said
what
i
could
to
comfort
her
and
offered
such
counsels
as
i
thought
she
most
required
advising
her
first
by
gentle
reasoning
by
kindness
example
and
persuasion
to
try
to
ameliorate
her
husband
and
then
when
she
had
done
all
she
could
if
she
still
found
him
incorrigible
to
endeavour
to
abstract
herself
from
wrap
herself
up
in
her
own
integrity
and
trouble
herself
as
little
about
him
as
possible
i
exhorted
her
to
seek
consolation
in
doing
her
duty
to
god
and
man
to
put
her
trust
in
heaven
and
solace
herself
with
the
care
and
nurture
of
her
little
daughter
assuring
her
she
would
be
amply
rewarded
by
witnessing
its
progress
in
strength
and
wisdom
and
receiving
its
genuine
affection
but
i
can
t
devote
myself
entirely
to
a
child
said
she
it
may
is
not
at
all
but
with
care
many
a
delicate
infant
has
become
a
strong
man
or
but
it
may
grow
so
intolerably
like
its
father
that
i
shall
hate
that
is
not
likely
it
is
a
little
girl
and
strongly
resembles
its
no
matter
i
should
like
it
better
if
it
were
a
that
its
father
will
leave
it
no
inheritance
that
he
can
possibly
squander
away
what
pleasure
can
i
have
in
seeing
a
girl
grow
up
to
eclipse
me
and
enjoy
those
pleasures
that
i
am
for
ever
debarred
from
but
supposing
i
could
be
so
generous
as
to
take
delight
in
this
still
it
is
a
child
and
i
can
t
centre
all
my
hopes
in
a
child
that
is
only
one
degree
better
than
devoting
oneself
to
a
dog
and
as
for
all
the
wisdom
and
goodness
you
have
been
trying
to
instil
into
is
all
very
right
and
proper
i
daresay
and
if
i
were
some
twenty
years
older
i
might
fructify
by
it
but
people
must
enjoy
themselves
when
they
are
young
and
if
others
won
t
let
they
must
hate
them
for
it
the
best
way
to
enjoy
yourself
is
to
do
what
is
right
and
hate
nobody
the
end
of
religion
is
not
to
teach
us
how
to
die
but
how
to
live
and
the
earlier
you
become
wise
and
good
the
more
of
happiness
you
secure
and
now
lady
ashby
i
have
one
more
piece
of
advice
to
offer
you
which
is
that
you
will
not
make
an
enemy
of
your
don
t
get
into
the
way
of
holding
her
at
arms
length
and
regarding
her
with
jealous
distrust
i
never
saw
her
but
i
have
heard
good
as
well
as
evil
respecting
her
and
i
imagine
that
though
cold
and
haughty
in
her
general
demeanour
and
even
exacting
in
her
requirements
she
has
strong
affections
for
those
who
can
reach
them
and
though
so
blindly
attached
to
her
son
she
is
not
without
good
principles
or
incapable
of
hearing
reason
if
you
would
but
conciliate
her
a
little
and
adopt
a
friendly
open
even
confide
your
grievances
to
grievances
such
as
you
have
a
right
to
complain
is
my
firm
belief
that
she
would
in
time
become
your
faithful
friend
and
a
comfort
and
support
to
you
instead
of
the
incubus
you
describe
but
i
fear
my
advice
had
little
effect
upon
the
unfortunate
young
lady
and
finding
i
could
render
myself
so
little
serviceable
my
residence
at
ashby
park
became
doubly
painful
but
still
i
must
stay
out
that
day
and
the
following
one
as
i
had
promised
to
do
so
though
resisting
all
entreaties
and
inducements
to
prolong
my
visit
further
i
insisted
upon
departing
the
next
morning
affirming
that
my
mother
would
be
lonely
without
me
and
that
she
impatiently
expected
my
return
nevertheless
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
i
bade
adieu
to
poor
lady
ashby
and
left
her
in
her
princely
home
it
was
no
slight
additional
proof
of
her
unhappiness
that
she
should
so
cling
to
the
consolation
of
my
presence
and
earnestly
desire
the
company
of
one
whose
general
tastes
and
ideas
were
so
little
congenial
to
her
she
had
completely
forgotten
in
her
hour
of
prosperity
and
whose
presence
would
be
rather
a
nuisance
than
a
pleasure
if
she
could
but
have
half
her
heart
s
desire
chapter
sands
our
school
was
not
situated
in
the
heart
of
the
town
on
entering
a
from
the
there
is
a
row
of
houses
on
each
side
of
the
broad
white
road
with
narrow
slips
of
before
them
venetian
blinds
to
the
windows
and
a
flight
of
steps
leading
to
each
trim
door
in
one
of
the
largest
of
these
habitations
dwelt
my
mother
and
i
with
such
young
ladies
as
our
friends
and
the
public
chose
to
commit
to
our
charge
consequently
we
were
a
considerable
distance
from
the
sea
and
divided
from
it
by
a
labyrinth
of
streets
and
houses
but
the
sea
was
my
delight
and
i
would
often
gladly
pierce
the
town
to
obtain
the
pleasure
of
a
walk
beside
it
whether
with
the
pupils
or
alone
with
my
mother
during
the
vacations
it
was
delightful
to
me
at
all
times
and
seasons
but
especially
in
the
wild
commotion
of
a
rough
and
in
the
brilliant
freshness
of
a
summer
morning
i
awoke
early
on
the
third
morning
after
my
return
from
ashby
sun
was
shining
through
the
blind
and
i
thought
how
pleasant
it
would
be
to
pass
through
the
quiet
town
and
take
a
solitary
ramble
on
the
sands
while
half
the
world
was
in
bed
i
was
not
long
in
forming
the
resolution
nor
slow
to
act
upon
it
of
course
i
would
not
disturb
my
mother
so
i
stole
noiselessly
downstairs
and
quietly
unfastened
the
door
i
was
dressed
and
out
when
the
church
clock
struck
a
quarter
to
six
there
was
a
feeling
of
freshness
and
vigour
in
the
very
streets
and
when
i
got
free
of
the
town
when
my
foot
was
on
the
sands
and
my
face
towards
the
broad
bright
bay
no
language
can
describe
the
effect
of
the
deep
clear
azure
of
the
sky
and
ocean
the
bright
morning
sunshine
on
the
semicircular
barrier
of
craggy
cliffs
surmounted
by
green
swelling
hills
and
on
the
smooth
wide
sands
and
the
low
rocks
out
at
with
their
clothing
of
weeds
and
moss
like
little
above
all
on
the
brilliant
sparkling
waves
and
then
the
unspeakable
freshness
of
the
air
there
was
just
enough
heat
to
enhance
the
value
of
the
breeze
and
just
enough
wind
to
keep
the
whole
sea
in
motion
to
make
the
waves
come
bounding
to
the
shore
foaming
and
sparkling
as
if
wild
with
glee
nothing
else
was
living
creature
was
visible
besides
myself
my
footsteps
were
the
first
to
press
the
firm
unbroken
sands
before
had
trampled
them
since
last
night
s
flowing
tide
had
obliterated
the
deepest
marks
of
yesterday
and
left
them
fair
and
even
except
where
the
subsiding
water
had
left
behind
it
the
traces
of
dimpled
pools
and
little
running
streams
refreshed
delighted
invigorated
i
walked
along
forgetting
all
my
cares
feeling
as
if
i
had
wings
to
my
feet
and
could
go
at
least
forty
miles
without
fatigue
and
experiencing
a
sense
of
exhilaration
to
which
i
had
been
an
entire
stranger
since
the
days
of
early
youth
about
six
however
the
grooms
began
to
come
down
to
air
their
masters
one
and
then
another
till
there
were
some
dozen
horses
and
five
or
six
riders
but
that
need
not
trouble
me
for
they
would
not
come
as
far
as
the
low
rocks
which
i
was
now
approaching
when
i
had
reached
these
and
walked
over
the
moist
slippery
at
the
risk
of
floundering
into
one
of
the
numerous
pools
of
clear
salt
water
that
lay
between
them
to
a
little
mossy
promontory
with
the
sea
splashing
round
it
i
looked
back
again
to
see
who
next
was
stirring
still
there
were
only
the
early
grooms
with
their
horses
and
one
gentleman
with
a
little
dark
speck
of
a
dog
running
before
him
and
one
coming
out
of
the
town
to
get
water
for
the
baths
in
another
minute
or
two
the
distant
bathing
machines
would
begin
to
move
and
then
the
elderly
gentlemen
of
regular
habits
and
sober
quaker
ladies
would
be
coming
to
take
their
salutary
morning
walks
but
however
interesting
such
a
scene
might
be
i
could
not
wait
to
witness
it
for
the
sun
and
the
sea
so
dazzled
my
eyes
in
that
direction
that
i
could
but
afford
one
glance
and
then
i
turned
again
to
delight
myself
with
the
sight
and
the
sound
of
the
sea
dashing
against
my
no
prodigious
force
for
the
swell
was
broken
by
the
tangled
and
the
unseen
rocks
beneath
otherwise
i
should
soon
have
been
deluged
with
spray
but
the
tide
was
coming
in
the
water
was
rising
the
gulfs
and
lakes
were
filling
the
straits
were
widening
it
was
time
to
seek
some
safer
footing
so
i
walked
skipped
and
stumbled
back
to
the
smooth
wide
sands
and
resolved
to
proceed
to
a
certain
bold
projection
in
the
cliffs
and
then
return
presently
i
heard
a
snuffling
sound
behind
me
and
then
a
dog
came
frisking
and
wriggling
to
my
feet
it
was
my
own
little
dark
terrier
when
i
spoke
his
name
he
leapt
up
in
my
face
and
yelled
for
joy
almost
as
much
delighted
as
himself
i
caught
the
little
creature
in
my
arms
and
kissed
him
repeatedly
but
how
came
he
to
be
there
he
could
not
have
dropped
from
the
sky
or
come
all
that
way
alone
it
must
be
either
his
master
the
or
somebody
else
that
had
brought
him
so
repressing
my
extravagant
caresses
and
endeavouring
to
repress
his
likewise
i
looked
round
and
weston
your
dog
remembers
you
well
miss
grey
said
he
warmly
grasping
the
hand
i
offered
him
without
clearly
knowing
what
i
was
about
you
rise
not
often
so
early
as
this
i
replied
with
amazing
composure
considering
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
how
far
do
you
purpose
to
extend
your
walk
i
was
thinking
of
must
be
almost
time
i
he
consulted
his
gold
one
told
me
it
was
only
five
minutes
past
seven
but
doubtless
you
have
had
a
long
enough
walk
said
he
turning
towards
the
town
to
which
i
now
proceeded
leisurely
to
retrace
my
steps
and
he
walked
beside
me
in
what
part
of
the
town
do
you
live
asked
he
i
never
could
never
could
discover
had
he
endeavoured
to
do
so
then
i
told
him
the
place
of
our
abode
he
asked
how
we
prospered
in
our
affairs
i
told
him
we
were
doing
very
we
had
had
a
considerable
addition
to
our
pupils
after
the
christmas
vacation
and
expected
a
still
further
increase
at
the
close
of
this
you
must
be
an
accomplished
instructor
he
observed
no
it
is
my
mother
i
replied
she
manages
things
so
well
and
is
so
active
and
clever
and
i
should
like
to
know
your
mother
will
you
introduce
me
to
her
some
time
if
i
call
yes
and
will
you
allow
me
the
privilege
of
an
old
friend
of
looking
in
upon
you
now
and
then
yes
suppose
this
was
a
very
foolish
answer
but
the
truth
was
i
considered
that
i
had
no
right
to
invite
anyone
to
my
mother
s
house
without
her
knowledge
and
if
i
had
said
yes
if
my
mother
does
not
object
it
would
appear
as
if
by
his
question
i
understood
more
than
was
expected
so
she
would
not
i
added
i
suppose
so
but
of
course
i
should
have
said
something
more
sensible
and
more
polite
if
i
had
had
my
wits
about
me
we
continued
our
walk
for
a
minute
in
silence
which
however
was
shortly
relieved
no
small
relief
to
me
by
weston
commenting
upon
the
brightness
of
the
morning
and
the
beauty
of
the
bay
and
then
upon
the
advantages
a
possessed
over
many
other
fashionable
places
of
resort
you
don
t
ask
what
brings
me
to
a
said
he
you
can
t
suppose
i
m
rich
enough
to
come
for
my
own
i
heard
you
had
left
you
didn
t
hear
then
that
i
had
got
the
living
of
f
f
was
a
village
about
two
miles
distant
from
a
no
said
i
we
live
so
completely
out
of
the
world
even
here
that
news
seldom
reaches
me
through
any
quarter
except
through
the
medium
of
but
i
hope
you
like
your
new
parish
and
that
i
may
congratulate
you
on
the
acquisition
i
expect
to
like
my
parish
better
a
year
or
two
hence
when
i
have
worked
certain
reforms
i
have
set
my
heart
at
least
progressed
some
steps
towards
such
an
achievement
but
you
may
congratulate
me
now
for
i
find
it
very
agreeable
to
a
parish
all
to
myself
with
nobody
to
interfere
with
thwart
my
plans
or
cripple
my
exertions
and
besides
i
have
a
respectable
house
in
a
rather
pleasant
neighbourhood
and
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
in
fact
i
have
nothing
but
solitude
to
complain
of
and
nothing
but
a
companion
to
wish
he
looked
at
me
as
he
concluded
and
the
flash
of
his
dark
eyes
seemed
to
set
my
face
on
fire
greatly
to
my
own
discomfiture
for
to
evince
confusion
at
such
a
juncture
was
intolerable
i
made
an
effort
therefore
to
remedy
the
evil
and
disclaim
all
personal
application
of
the
remark
by
a
hasty
reply
to
the
effect
that
if
he
waited
till
he
was
well
known
in
the
neighbourhood
he
might
have
numerous
opportunities
for
supplying
his
want
among
the
residents
of
f
and
its
vicinity
or
the
visitors
of
a
if
he
required
so
ample
a
choice
not
considering
the
compliment
implied
by
such
an
assertion
till
his
answer
made
me
aware
of
it
i
am
not
so
presumptuous
as
to
believe
that
said
he
though
you
tell
it
me
but
if
it
were
so
i
am
rather
particular
in
my
notions
of
a
companion
for
life
and
perhaps
i
might
not
find
one
to
suit
me
among
the
ladies
you
if
you
require
perfection
you
never
i
do
have
no
right
to
require
it
as
being
so
far
from
perfect
here
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
lumbering
past
us
for
we
were
now
come
to
the
busy
part
of
the
sands
and
for
the
next
eight
or
ten
minutes
between
carts
and
horses
and
asses
and
men
there
was
little
room
for
social
intercourse
till
we
had
turned
our
backs
upon
the
sea
and
begun
to
ascend
the
precipitous
road
leading
into
the
town
here
my
companion
offered
me
his
arm
which
i
accepted
though
not
with
the
intention
of
using
it
as
a
support
you
don
t
often
come
on
to
the
sands
i
think
said
he
for
i
have
walked
there
many
times
both
morning
and
evening
since
i
came
and
never
seen
you
till
now
and
several
times
in
passing
through
the
town
too
i
have
looked
about
for
your
i
did
not
think
of
and
once
or
twice
i
made
inquiries
but
without
obtaining
the
requisite
when
we
had
surmounted
the
acclivity
i
was
about
to
withdraw
my
arm
from
his
but
by
a
slight
tightening
of
the
elbow
was
tacitly
informed
that
such
was
not
his
will
and
accordingly
desisted
discoursing
on
different
subjects
we
entered
the
town
and
passed
through
several
streets
i
saw
that
he
was
going
out
of
his
way
to
accompany
me
notwithstanding
the
long
walk
that
was
yet
before
him
and
fearing
that
he
might
be
inconveniencing
himself
from
motives
of
politeness
i
i
fear
i
am
taking
you
out
of
your
way
believe
the
road
to
f
lies
quite
in
another
i
ll
leave
you
at
the
end
of
the
next
street
said
he
and
when
will
you
come
to
see
mamma
the
end
of
the
next
street
was
nearly
the
conclusion
of
my
journey
he
stopped
there
however
bid
me
and
called
snap
who
seemed
a
little
doubtful
whether
to
follow
his
old
mistress
or
his
new
master
but
trotted
away
upon
being
summoned
by
the
latter
i
won
t
offer
to
restore
him
to
you
miss
grey
said
weston
smiling
because
i
like
oh
i
don
t
want
him
replied
i
now
that
he
has
a
good
master
i
m
quite
you
take
it
for
granted
that
i
am
a
good
one
then
the
man
and
the
dog
departed
and
i
returned
home
full
of
gratitude
to
heaven
for
so
much
bliss
and
praying
that
my
hopes
might
not
again
be
crushed
chapter
well
agnes
you
must
not
take
such
long
walks
again
before
breakfast
said
my
mother
observing
that
i
drank
an
extra
cup
of
coffee
and
ate
the
heat
of
the
weather
and
the
fatigue
of
my
long
walk
as
an
excuse
i
certainly
did
feel
feverish
and
tired
too
you
always
do
things
by
extremes
now
if
you
had
taken
a
walk
every
morning
and
would
continue
to
do
so
it
would
do
you
well
mamma
i
but
this
is
worse
than
lying
in
bed
or
bending
over
your
books
you
have
quite
put
yourself
into
a
i
won
t
do
it
again
said
i
was
racking
my
brains
with
thinking
how
to
tell
her
about
weston
for
she
must
know
he
was
coming
however
i
waited
till
the
breakfast
things
were
removed
and
i
was
more
calm
and
cool
and
then
having
sat
down
to
my
drawing
i
i
met
an
old
friend
on
the
sands
an
old
friend
who
could
it
be
two
old
friends
indeed
one
was
a
dog
and
then
i
reminded
her
of
snap
whose
history
i
had
recounted
before
and
related
the
incident
of
his
sudden
appearance
and
remarkable
recognition
and
the
other
continued
i
was
weston
the
curate
of
mr
weston
i
never
heard
of
him
yes
you
have
i
ve
mentioned
him
several
times
i
believe
but
you
don
t
i
ve
heard
you
speak
of
mr
hatfield
was
the
rector
and
weston
the
curate
i
used
to
mention
him
sometimes
in
contradistinction
to
hatfield
as
being
a
more
efficient
clergyman
however
he
was
on
the
sands
this
morning
with
the
had
bought
it
i
suppose
from
the
and
he
knew
me
as
well
as
it
through
its
means
and
i
had
a
little
conversation
with
him
in
the
course
of
which
as
he
asked
about
our
school
i
was
led
to
say
something
about
you
and
your
good
management
and
he
said
he
should
like
to
know
you
and
asked
if
i
would
introduce
him
to
you
if
he
should
take
the
liberty
of
calling
so
i
said
i
would
was
i
right
of
course
what
kind
of
a
man
is
he
a
very
man
i
think
but
you
will
see
him
he
is
the
new
vicar
of
f
and
as
he
has
only
been
there
a
few
weeks
i
suppose
he
has
made
no
friends
yet
and
wants
a
little
the
morrow
came
what
a
fever
of
anxiety
and
expectation
i
was
in
from
breakfast
till
which
time
he
made
his
appearance
having
introduced
him
to
my
mother
i
took
my
work
to
the
window
and
sat
down
to
await
the
result
of
the
interview
they
got
on
extremely
well
to
my
satisfaction
for
i
had
felt
very
anxious
about
what
my
mother
would
think
of
him
he
did
not
stay
long
that
time
but
when
he
rose
to
take
leave
she
said
she
should
be
happy
to
see
him
whenever
he
might
find
it
convenient
to
call
again
and
when
he
was
gone
i
was
gratified
by
hearing
her
say
well
i
think
he
s
a
very
sensible
man
but
why
did
you
sit
back
there
agnes
she
added
and
talk
so
little
because
you
talked
so
well
mamma
i
thought
you
required
no
assistance
from
me
and
besides
he
was
your
visitor
not
after
that
he
often
called
upon
times
in
the
course
of
a
week
he
generally
addressed
most
of
his
conversation
to
my
mother
and
no
wonder
for
she
could
converse
i
almost
envied
the
unfettered
vigorous
fluency
of
her
discourse
and
the
strong
sense
evinced
by
everything
she
yet
i
did
not
for
though
i
occasionally
regretted
my
own
deficiencies
for
his
sake
it
gave
me
very
great
pleasure
to
sit
and
hear
the
two
beings
i
loved
and
honoured
above
every
one
else
in
the
world
discoursing
together
so
amicably
so
wisely
and
so
well
i
was
not
always
silent
however
nor
was
i
at
all
neglected
i
was
quite
as
much
noticed
as
i
would
wish
to
be
there
was
no
lack
of
kind
words
and
kinder
looks
no
end
of
delicate
attentions
too
fine
and
subtle
to
be
grasped
by
words
and
therefore
deeply
felt
at
heart
ceremony
was
quickly
dropped
between
us
weston
came
as
an
expected
guest
welcome
at
all
times
and
never
deranging
the
economy
of
our
household
affairs
he
even
called
me
agnes
the
name
had
been
timidly
spoken
at
first
but
finding
it
gave
no
offence
in
any
quarter
he
seemed
greatly
to
prefer
that
appellation
to
miss
grey
and
so
did
i
how
tedious
and
gloomy
were
those
days
in
which
he
did
not
come
and
yet
not
miserable
for
i
had
still
the
remembrance
of
the
last
visit
and
the
hope
of
the
next
to
cheer
me
but
when
two
or
three
days
passed
without
my
seeing
him
i
certainly
felt
very
unreasonably
so
for
of
course
he
had
his
own
business
and
the
affairs
of
his
parish
to
attend
to
and
i
dreaded
the
close
of
the
holidays
when
business
also
would
begin
and
i
should
be
sometimes
unable
to
see
him
and
my
mother
was
in
the
to
be
with
him
alone
a
position
i
did
not
at
all
desire
in
the
house
though
to
meet
him
out
of
doors
and
walk
beside
him
had
proved
by
no
means
disagreeable
one
evening
however
in
the
last
week
of
the
vacation
he
for
a
heavy
and
protracted
during
the
afternoon
had
almost
destroyed
my
hopes
of
seeing
him
that
day
but
now
the
storm
was
over
and
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
a
beautiful
evening
grey
said
he
as
he
entered
agnes
i
want
you
to
take
a
walk
with
me
to
he
named
a
certain
part
of
the
bold
hill
on
the
land
side
and
towards
the
sea
a
steep
precipice
from
the
summit
of
which
a
glorious
view
is
to
be
had
the
rain
has
laid
the
dust
and
cooled
and
cleared
the
air
and
the
prospect
will
be
magnificent
will
you
come
can
i
go
mamma
yes
to
be
i
went
to
get
ready
and
was
down
again
in
a
few
minutes
though
of
course
i
took
a
little
more
pains
with
my
attire
than
if
i
had
merely
been
going
out
on
some
shopping
expedition
alone
the
had
certainly
had
a
most
beneficial
effect
upon
the
weather
and
the
evening
was
most
delightful
weston
would
have
me
to
take
his
arm
he
said
little
during
our
passage
through
the
crowded
streets
but
walked
very
fast
and
appeared
grave
and
abstracted
i
wondered
what
was
the
matter
and
felt
an
indefinite
dread
that
something
unpleasant
was
on
his
mind
and
vague
surmises
concerning
what
it
might
be
troubled
me
not
a
little
and
made
me
grave
and
silent
enough
but
these
fantasies
vanished
upon
reaching
the
quiet
outskirts
of
the
town
for
as
soon
as
we
came
within
sight
of
the
venerable
old
church
and
with
the
deep
blue
beyond
it
i
found
my
companion
was
cheerful
enough
i
m
afraid
i
ve
been
walking
too
fast
for
you
agnes
said
he
in
my
impatience
to
be
rid
of
the
town
i
forgot
to
consult
your
convenience
but
now
we
ll
walk
as
slowly
as
you
please
i
see
by
those
light
clouds
in
the
west
there
will
be
a
brilliant
sunset
and
we
shall
be
in
time
to
witness
its
effect
upon
the
sea
at
the
most
moderate
rate
of
when
we
had
got
about
up
the
hill
we
fell
into
silence
again
which
as
usual
he
was
the
first
to
break
my
house
is
desolate
yet
miss
grey
he
smilingly
observed
and
i
am
acquainted
now
with
all
the
ladies
in
my
parish
and
several
in
this
town
too
and
many
others
i
know
by
sight
and
by
report
but
not
one
of
them
will
suit
me
for
a
companion
in
fact
there
is
only
one
person
in
the
world
that
will
and
that
is
yourself
and
i
want
to
know
your
decision
are
you
in
earnest
weston
in
earnest
how
could
you
think
i
should
jest
on
such
a
subject
he
laid
his
hand
on
mine
that
rested
on
his
arm
he
must
have
felt
it
it
was
no
great
matter
now
i
hope
i
have
not
been
too
precipitate
he
said
in
a
serious
tone
you
must
have
known
that
it
was
not
my
way
to
flatter
and
talk
soft
nonsense
or
even
to
speak
the
admiration
that
i
felt
and
that
a
single
word
or
glance
of
mine
meant
more
than
the
honied
phrases
and
fervent
protestations
of
most
other
i
said
something
about
not
liking
to
leave
my
mother
and
doing
nothing
without
her
consent
i
settled
everything
with
grey
while
you
were
putting
on
your
bonnet
replied
he
she
said
i
might
have
her
consent
if
i
could
obtain
yours
and
i
asked
her
in
case
i
should
be
so
happy
to
come
and
live
with
i
was
sure
you
would
like
it
better
but
she
refused
saying
she
could
now
afford
to
employ
an
assistant
and
would
continue
the
school
till
she
could
purchase
an
annuity
sufficient
to
maintain
her
in
comfortable
lodgings
and
meantime
she
would
spend
her
vacations
alternately
with
us
and
your
sister
and
should
be
quite
contented
if
you
were
happy
and
so
now
i
have
overruled
your
objections
on
her
account
have
you
any
other
you
love
me
then
said
be
fervently
pressing
my
hand
here
i
pause
my
diary
from
which
i
have
compiled
these
pages
goes
but
little
further
i
could
go
on
for
years
but
i
will
content
myself
with
adding
that
i
shall
never
forget
that
glorious
summer
evening
and
always
remember
with
delight
that
steep
hill
and
the
edge
of
the
precipice
where
we
stood
together
watching
the
splendid
sunset
mirrored
in
the
restless
world
of
waters
at
our
hearts
filled
with
gratitude
to
heaven
and
happiness
and
too
full
for
speech
a
few
weeks
after
that
when
my
mother
had
supplied
herself
with
an
assistant
i
became
the
wife
of
edward
weston
and
never
have
found
cause
to
repent
it
and
am
certain
that
i
never
shall
we
have
had
trials
and
we
know
that
we
must
have
them
again
but
we
bear
them
well
together
and
endeavour
to
fortify
ourselves
and
each
other
against
the
final
greatest
of
all
afflictions
to
the
survivor
but
if
we
keep
in
mind
the
glorious
heaven
beyond
where
both
may
meet
again
and
sin
and
sorrow
are
unknown
surely
that
too
may
be
borne
and
meantime
we
endeavour
to
live
to
the
glory
of
him
who
has
scattered
so
many
blessings
in
our
path
edward
by
his
strenuous
exertions
has
worked
surprising
reforms
in
his
parish
and
is
esteemed
and
loved
by
its
he
deserves
for
whatever
his
faults
may
be
as
a
man
and
no
one
is
entirely
without
i
defy
anybody
to
blame
him
as
a
pastor
a
husband
or
a
father
our
children
edward
agnes
and
little
mary
promise
well
their
education
for
the
time
being
is
chiefly
committed
to
me
and
they
shall
want
no
good
thing
that
a
mother
s
care
can
give
our
modest
income
is
amply
sufficient
for
our
requirements
and
by
practising
the
economy
we
learnt
in
harder
times
and
never
attempting
to
imitate
our
richer
neighbours
we
manage
not
only
to
enjoy
comfort
and
contentment
ourselves
but
to
have
every
year
something
to
lay
by
for
our
children
and
something
to
give
to
those
who
need
it
and
now
i
think
i
have
said
sufficient
and
