preface
a
small
portion
of
this
tale
appeared
in
once
a
week
under
the
title
of
a
good
after
writing
it
i
took
wider
views
of
the
subject
and
also
felt
uneasy
at
having
deviated
unnecessarily
from
the
historical
outline
of
a
true
story
these
two
sentiments
have
cost
me
more
than
a
year
very
hard
labour
which
i
venture
to
think
has
not
been
wasted
after
this
plain
statement
i
trust
all
who
comment
on
this
work
will
see
that
to
describe
it
as
a
reprint
would
be
unfair
to
the
public
and
to
me
the
english
language
is
copious
and
in
any
true
man
hands
quite
able
to
convey
the
truth
namely
that
of
the
present
work
is
a
reprint
and
of
it
a
new
composition
charles
reade
chapter
i
not
a
day
passes
over
the
earth
but
men
and
women
of
no
note
do
great
deeds
speak
great
words
and
suffer
noble
sorrows
of
these
obscure
heroes
philosophers
and
martyrs
the
greater
part
will
never
be
known
till
that
hour
when
many
that
are
great
shall
be
small
and
the
small
great
but
of
others
the
world
knowledge
may
be
said
to
sleep
their
lives
and
characters
lie
hidden
from
nations
in
the
annals
that
record
them
the
general
reader
can
not
feel
them
they
are
presented
so
curtly
and
coldly
they
are
not
like
breathing
stories
appealing
to
his
heart
but
little
historic
striking
him
but
to
glance
off
his
bosom
nor
can
he
understand
them
for
epitomes
are
not
narratives
as
skeletons
are
not
human
figures
thus
records
of
prime
truths
remain
a
dead
letter
to
plain
folk
the
writers
have
left
so
much
to
the
imagination
and
imagination
is
so
rare
a
gift
here
then
the
writer
of
fiction
may
be
of
use
to
the
public
as
an
interpreter
there
is
a
musty
chronicle
written
in
intolerable
latin
and
in
it
a
chapter
where
every
sentence
holds
a
fact
here
is
told
with
harsh
brevity
the
strange
history
of
a
pair
who
lived
untrumpeted
and
died
unsung
four
hundred
years
ago
and
lie
now
as
unpitied
in
that
stern
page
as
fossils
in
a
rock
thus
living
or
dead
fate
is
still
unjust
to
them
for
if
i
can
but
show
you
what
lies
below
that
dry
words
methinks
you
will
correct
the
indifference
of
centuries
and
give
those
two
souls
a
place
in
your
heart
for
a
day
it
was
past
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
louis
xi
was
sovereign
of
france
edward
iv
was
wrongful
king
of
england
and
philip
the
good
having
by
force
and
cunning
dispossessed
his
cousin
jacqueline
and
broken
her
heart
reigned
undisturbed
this
many
years
in
holland
where
our
tale
begins
elias
and
catherine
his
wife
lived
in
the
little
town
of
tergou
he
traded
wholesale
and
retail
in
cloth
silk
brown
holland
and
above
all
in
curried
leather
a
material
highly
valued
by
the
middling
people
because
it
would
stand
twenty
years
wear
and
turn
an
ordinary
knife
no
small
virtue
in
a
jerkin
of
that
century
in
which
folk
were
so
liberal
of
their
steel
even
at
dinner
a
man
would
leave
his
meat
awhile
and
carve
you
his
neighbour
on
a
very
moderate
difference
of
opinion
the
couple
were
well
to
do
and
would
have
been
free
from
all
earthly
care
but
for
nine
children
when
these
were
coming
into
the
world
one
per
annum
each
was
hailed
with
rejoicings
and
the
saints
were
thanked
not
expostulated
with
and
when
parents
and
children
were
all
young
together
the
latter
were
looked
upon
as
lovely
little
playthings
invented
by
heaven
for
the
amusement
joy
and
evening
solace
of
people
in
business
but
as
the
shot
up
and
the
parents
grew
older
and
saw
with
their
own
eyes
the
fate
of
large
families
misgivings
and
care
mingled
with
their
love
they
belonged
to
a
singularly
wise
and
provident
people
in
holland
reckless
parents
were
as
rare
as
disobedient
children
so
now
when
the
huge
loaf
came
in
on
a
gigantic
trencher
looking
like
a
fortress
in
its
moat
and
the
tour
of
the
table
once
made
seemed
to
have
melted
away
elias
and
catherine
would
look
at
one
another
and
say
who
is
to
find
bread
for
them
all
when
we
are
gone
at
this
observation
the
younger
ones
needed
all
their
filial
respect
to
keep
their
little
dutch
countenances
for
in
their
opinion
dinner
and
supper
came
by
nature
like
sunrise
and
sunset
and
so
long
as
that
luminary
should
travel
round
the
earth
so
long
as
the
brown
loaf
go
round
their
family
circle
and
set
in
their
stomachs
only
to
rise
again
in
the
family
oven
but
the
remark
awakened
the
national
thoughtfulness
of
the
elder
boys
and
being
often
repeated
set
several
of
the
family
thinking
some
of
them
good
thoughts
some
ill
thoughts
according
to
the
nature
of
the
thinkers
kate
the
children
grow
so
this
table
will
soon
be
too
we
can
not
afford
it
eli
replied
catherine
answering
not
his
words
but
his
thought
after
the
manner
of
women
their
anxiety
for
the
future
took
at
times
a
less
dismal
but
more
mortifying
turn
the
free
burghers
had
their
pride
as
well
as
the
nobles
and
these
two
could
not
bear
that
any
of
their
blood
should
go
down
in
the
burgh
after
their
decease
so
by
prudence
and
they
managed
to
clothe
all
the
little
bodies
and
feed
all
the
great
mouths
and
yet
put
by
a
small
hoard
to
meet
the
future
and
as
it
grew
and
grew
they
felt
a
pleasure
the
miser
hoarding
for
himself
knows
not
one
day
the
eldest
boy
but
one
aged
nineteen
came
to
his
mother
and
with
that
outward
composure
which
has
so
misled
some
persons
as
to
the
real
nature
of
this
people
begged
her
to
intercede
with
his
father
to
send
him
to
amsterdam
and
place
him
with
a
merchant
it
is
the
way
of
life
that
likes
me
merchants
are
wealthy
i
am
good
at
numbers
prithee
good
mother
take
my
part
in
this
and
i
shall
ever
be
as
i
am
now
your
catherine
threw
up
her
hands
with
dismay
and
incredulity
what
leave
tergou
what
is
one
street
to
me
more
than
another
if
i
can
leave
the
folk
of
tergou
i
can
surely
leave
the
what
quit
your
poor
father
now
he
is
no
longer
young
mother
if
i
can
leave
you
i
can
leave
what
leave
your
poor
brothers
and
sisters
that
love
you
so
dear
there
are
enough
in
the
house
without
what
mean
you
richart
who
is
more
thought
of
than
you
stay
have
i
spoken
sharp
to
you
have
i
been
unkind
to
you
never
that
i
know
of
and
if
you
had
you
should
never
hear
of
it
from
me
mother
said
richart
gravely
but
the
tear
was
in
his
eye
it
all
lies
in
a
word
and
nothing
can
change
my
mind
there
will
be
one
mouth
less
for
you
to
feed
there
now
see
what
my
tongue
has
done
said
catherine
and
the
next
moment
she
began
to
cry
for
she
saw
her
first
young
bird
on
the
edge
of
the
nest
trying
his
wings
to
fly
into
the
world
richart
had
a
calm
strong
will
and
she
knew
he
never
wasted
a
word
it
ended
as
nature
has
willed
all
such
discourse
shall
end
young
richart
went
to
amsterdam
with
a
face
so
long
and
sad
as
it
had
never
been
seen
before
and
a
heart
like
granite
that
afternoon
at
supper
there
was
one
mouth
less
catherine
looked
at
richart
chair
and
wept
bitterly
on
this
elias
shouted
roughly
and
angrily
to
the
children
sit
wider
ca
ye
sit
wider
and
turned
his
head
away
over
the
back
of
his
seat
awhile
and
was
silent
richart
was
launched
and
never
cost
them
another
penny
but
to
fit
him
out
and
place
him
in
the
house
of
vander
stegen
the
merchant
took
all
the
little
hoard
but
one
gold
crown
they
began
again
two
years
passed
richart
found
a
niche
in
commerce
for
his
brother
jacob
and
jacob
left
tergou
directly
after
dinner
which
was
at
eleven
in
the
forenoon
at
supper
that
day
elias
remembered
what
had
happened
the
last
time
so
it
was
in
a
low
whisper
he
said
sit
wider
dears
now
until
that
moment
catherine
would
not
see
the
gap
at
table
for
her
daughter
catherine
had
besought
her
not
to
grieve
and
she
had
said
no
sweetheart
i
promise
i
will
not
since
it
vexes
my
but
when
elias
whispered
sit
wider
says
she
ay
the
table
will
soon
be
too
big
for
the
children
and
you
thought
it
would
be
too
small
and
having
delivered
this
with
forced
calmness
she
put
up
her
apron
the
next
moment
and
wept
sore
is
the
best
that
leave
us
sobbed
she
that
is
the
cruel
nay
nay
said
elias
our
children
are
good
children
and
all
are
dear
to
us
alike
heed
her
not
what
god
takes
from
us
still
seems
better
that
what
he
spares
to
us
that
is
to
say
men
are
by
nature
unthankful
and
women
and
i
say
richart
and
jacob
were
the
flower
of
the
flock
sobbed
catherine
the
little
coffer
was
empty
again
and
to
fill
it
they
gathered
like
ants
in
those
days
speculation
was
pretty
much
confined
to
the
business
elias
knew
no
way
to
wealth
but
the
slow
and
sure
one
a
penny
saved
is
a
penny
gained
was
his
humble
creed
all
that
was
not
required
for
the
business
and
the
necessaries
of
life
went
into
the
little
coffer
with
steel
bands
and
florid
key
they
denied
themselves
in
turn
the
humblest
luxuries
and
then
catching
one
another
looks
smiled
perhaps
with
a
greater
joy
than
has
to
bestow
and
so
in
three
years
more
they
had
gleaned
enough
to
set
up
their
fourth
son
as
a
and
their
eldest
daughter
as
a
robemaker
in
tergou
here
were
two
more
provided
for
their
own
trade
would
enable
them
to
throw
work
into
the
hands
of
this
pair
but
the
coffer
was
drained
to
the
dregs
and
this
time
the
shop
too
bled
a
little
in
goods
if
not
in
coin
alas
there
remained
on
hand
two
that
were
unable
to
get
their
bread
and
two
that
were
unwilling
the
unable
ones
were
giles
a
dwarf
of
the
wrong
sort
half
stupidity
half
malice
all
head
and
claws
and
voice
run
from
by
dogs
and
unprejudiced
females
and
sided
with
through
thick
and
thin
by
his
mother
little
catherine
a
poor
little
girl
that
could
only
move
on
crutches
she
lived
in
pain
but
smiled
through
it
with
her
marble
face
and
violet
eyes
and
long
silky
lashes
and
fretful
or
repining
word
never
came
from
her
lips
the
unwilling
ones
were
sybrandt
the
youngest
a
too
much
in
love
with
play
to
work
and
cornelis
the
eldest
who
had
made
calculations
and
stuck
to
the
hearth
waiting
for
dead
men
shoes
almost
worn
out
by
their
repeated
efforts
and
above
all
dispirited
by
the
moral
and
physical
infirmities
of
those
that
now
remained
on
hand
the
anxious
couple
would
often
say
what
will
become
of
all
these
when
we
shall
be
no
longer
here
to
take
care
of
them
but
when
they
had
said
this
a
good
many
times
suddenly
the
domestic
horizon
cleared
and
then
they
used
still
to
say
it
because
a
habit
is
a
habit
but
they
uttered
it
half
mechanically
now
and
added
brightly
and
cheerfully
but
thanks
to
bavon
and
all
the
saints
there
young
gerard
was
for
many
years
of
his
life
a
son
apart
and
he
was
going
into
the
church
and
the
church
could
always
maintain
her
children
by
hook
or
by
crook
in
those
days
no
great
hopes
because
his
family
had
no
interest
with
the
great
to
get
him
a
benefice
and
the
young
own
habits
were
frivolous
and
indeed
such
as
our
cloth
merchant
would
not
have
put
up
with
in
any
one
but
a
clerk
that
was
to
be
his
trivialities
were
reading
and
penmanship
and
he
was
so
wrapped
up
in
them
that
often
he
could
hardly
be
got
away
to
his
meals
the
day
was
never
long
enough
for
him
and
he
carried
ever
a
and
brimstone
matches
and
begged
ends
of
candles
of
the
neighbours
which
he
lighted
at
unreasonable
hours
ay
even
at
eight
of
the
clock
at
night
in
winter
when
the
very
burgomaster
was
abed
endured
at
home
his
practices
were
encouraged
by
the
monks
of
a
neighbouring
convent
they
had
taught
him
penmanship
and
continued
to
teach
him
until
one
day
they
discovered
in
the
middle
of
a
lesson
that
he
was
teaching
them
they
pointed
this
out
to
him
in
a
merry
way
he
hung
his
head
and
blushed
he
had
suspected
as
much
himself
but
mistrusted
his
judgment
in
so
delicate
a
matter
but
my
son
said
an
elderly
monk
how
is
it
that
you
to
whom
god
has
given
an
eye
so
true
a
hand
so
subtle
yet
firm
and
a
heart
to
love
these
beautiful
crafts
how
is
it
you
do
not
colour
as
well
as
write
a
scroll
looks
but
barren
unless
a
border
of
fruit
and
leaves
and
rich
arabesques
surround
the
good
words
and
charm
the
sense
as
those
do
the
soul
and
understanding
to
say
nothing
of
the
pictures
of
holy
men
and
women
departed
with
which
the
several
chapters
should
be
adorned
and
not
alone
the
eye
soothed
with
the
brave
and
sweetly
blended
colours
but
the
heart
lifted
by
effigies
of
the
saints
in
glory
answer
me
my
at
this
gerard
was
confused
and
muttered
that
he
had
made
several
trials
at
illuminating
but
had
not
succeeded
well
and
thus
the
matter
rested
soon
after
this
a
came
on
the
scene
in
the
unwonted
form
of
an
old
lady
margaret
sister
and
survivor
of
the
brothers
van
eyck
left
flanders
and
came
to
end
her
days
in
her
native
country
she
bought
a
small
house
near
tergou
in
course
of
time
she
heard
of
gerard
and
saw
some
of
his
handiwork
it
pleased
her
so
well
that
she
sent
her
female
servant
reicht
heynes
to
ask
him
to
come
to
her
this
led
to
an
acquaintance
it
could
hardly
be
otherwise
for
little
tergou
had
never
held
so
many
as
two
zealots
of
this
sort
before
at
first
the
old
lady
damped
gerard
courage
terribly
at
each
visit
she
fished
out
of
holes
and
corners
drawings
and
paintings
some
of
them
by
her
own
hand
that
seemed
to
him
unapproachable
but
if
the
artist
overpowered
him
the
woman
kept
his
heart
up
she
and
reicht
soon
turned
him
inside
out
like
a
glove
among
other
things
they
drew
from
him
what
the
good
monks
had
failed
to
hit
upon
the
reason
why
he
did
not
illuminate
that
he
could
not
afford
the
gold
the
blue
and
the
red
but
only
the
cheap
earths
and
that
he
was
afraid
to
ask
his
mother
to
buy
the
choice
colours
and
was
sure
he
should
ask
her
in
vain
then
margaret
van
eyck
gave
him
a
little
brush
gold
and
some
vermilion
and
ultramarine
and
a
piece
of
good
vellum
to
lay
them
on
he
almost
adored
her
as
he
left
the
house
reicht
ran
after
him
with
a
candle
and
two
quarters
he
quite
kissed
her
but
better
even
than
the
gold
and
to
the
illuminator
was
the
sympathy
to
the
isolated
enthusiast
that
sympathy
was
always
ready
and
as
he
returned
it
an
affection
sprung
up
between
the
old
painter
and
the
young
caligrapher
that
was
doubly
characteristic
of
the
time
for
this
was
a
century
in
which
the
fine
arts
and
the
higher
mechanical
arts
were
not
separated
by
any
distinct
boundary
nor
were
those
who
practised
them
and
it
was
an
age
in
which
artists
sought
out
and
loved
one
another
should
this
last
statement
stagger
a
painter
or
writer
of
our
day
let
me
remind
him
that
even
christians
loved
one
another
at
first
starting
backed
by
an
acquaintance
so
venerable
and
strengthened
by
female
sympathy
gerard
advanced
in
learning
and
skill
his
spirits
too
rose
visibly
he
still
looked
behind
him
when
dragged
to
dinner
in
the
middle
of
an
initial
g
but
once
seated
showed
great
social
qualities
likewise
a
gay
humour
that
had
hitherto
but
peeped
in
him
shone
out
and
often
he
set
the
table
in
a
roar
and
kept
it
there
sometimes
with
his
own
wit
sometimes
with
jests
which
were
glossy
new
to
his
family
being
drawn
from
antiquity
as
a
return
for
all
he
owed
his
friends
the
monks
he
made
them
exquisite
copies
from
two
of
their
choicest
the
life
of
their
founder
and
their
comedies
of
terence
the
monastery
finding
the
vellum
the
high
and
puissant
prince
philip
the
good
duke
of
burgundy
luxemburg
and
brabant
earl
of
holland
and
zealand
lord
of
friesland
count
of
flanders
artois
and
hainault
lord
of
salins
and
macklyn
was
versatile
he
could
fight
as
well
as
any
king
going
and
lie
could
lie
as
well
as
any
except
the
king
of
france
he
was
a
mighty
hunter
and
could
read
and
write
his
tastes
were
wide
and
ardent
he
loved
jewels
like
a
woman
and
gorgeous
apparel
he
dearly
loved
maids
of
honour
and
indeed
paintings
generally
in
proof
of
which
he
ennobled
jan
van
eyck
he
had
also
a
rage
for
giants
dwarfs
and
turks
these
last
stood
ever
planted
about
him
turbaned
and
blazing
with
jewels
his
agents
inveigled
them
from
istamboul
with
fair
promises
but
the
moment
he
had
got
them
he
baptized
them
by
brute
force
in
a
large
tub
and
this
done
let
them
squat
with
their
faces
towards
mecca
and
invoke
mahound
as
much
as
they
pleased
laughing
in
his
sleeve
at
their
simplicity
in
fancying
they
were
still
infidels
he
had
lions
in
cages
and
fleet
leopards
trained
by
orientals
to
run
down
hares
and
deer
in
short
he
relished
all
rarities
except
the
humdrum
virtues
for
anything
singularly
pretty
or
diabolically
ugly
this
was
your
customer
the
best
of
him
was
he
was
openhanded
to
the
poor
and
the
next
best
was
he
fostered
the
arts
in
earnest
whereof
he
now
gave
a
signal
proof
he
offered
prizes
for
the
best
specimens
of
orfevrerie
in
two
kinds
religious
and
secular
item
for
the
best
paintings
in
white
of
egg
oils
and
tempera
these
to
be
on
panel
silk
or
metal
as
the
artists
chose
item
for
the
best
transparent
painting
on
glass
item
for
the
best
illuminating
and
on
vellum
item
for
the
fairest
writing
on
vellum
the
burgomasters
of
the
several
towns
were
commanded
to
aid
all
the
poorer
competitors
by
receiving
their
specimens
and
sending
them
with
due
care
to
rotterdam
at
the
expense
of
their
several
burghs
when
this
was
cried
by
the
bellman
through
the
streets
of
tergou
a
thousand
mouths
opened
and
one
heart
beat
gerard
he
told
his
family
timidly
he
should
try
for
two
of
those
prizes
they
stared
in
silence
for
their
breath
was
gone
at
his
audacity
but
one
horrid
laugh
exploded
on
the
floor
like
a
petard
gerard
looked
down
and
there
was
the
dwarf
slit
and
fanged
from
ear
to
ear
at
his
expense
and
laughing
like
a
lion
nature
relenting
at
having
made
giles
so
small
had
given
him
as
a
the
biggest
voice
on
record
his
very
whisper
was
a
bassoon
he
was
like
those
stunted
pieces
of
ordnance
we
see
on
fortifications
more
like
a
than
a
cannon
but
ods
tympana
how
they
bellow
gerard
turned
red
with
anger
the
more
so
as
the
others
began
to
titter
white
catherine
saw
and
a
pink
tinge
came
on
her
cheek
she
said
softly
why
do
you
laugh
is
it
because
he
is
our
brother
you
think
he
can
not
be
capable
yes
gerard
try
with
the
rest
many
say
you
are
skilful
and
mother
and
i
will
pray
the
virgin
to
guide
your
thank
you
little
kate
you
shall
pray
to
our
lady
and
our
mother
shall
buy
me
vellum
and
the
colours
to
illuminate
what
will
they
cost
my
lad
two
gold
crowns
about
three
shillings
and
fourpence
english
money
what
screamed
the
housewife
when
the
bushel
of
rye
costs
but
a
groat
what
me
spend
a
month
meal
and
meat
and
fire
on
such
vanity
as
that
the
lightning
from
heaven
would
fall
on
me
and
my
children
would
all
be
mother
sighed
little
catherine
imploringly
oh
it
is
in
vain
kate
said
gerard
with
a
sigh
i
shall
have
to
give
it
up
or
ask
the
dame
van
eyck
she
would
give
it
me
but
i
think
shame
to
be
for
ever
taking
from
it
is
not
her
affair
said
catherine
very
sharply
what
has
she
to
do
coming
between
me
and
my
son
and
she
left
the
room
with
a
red
face
little
catherine
smiled
presently
the
housewife
returned
with
a
gracious
affectionate
air
and
two
little
gold
pieces
in
her
hand
there
sweetheart
said
she
you
wo
have
to
trouble
dame
or
demoiselle
for
two
paltry
but
on
this
gerard
fell
a
thinking
how
he
could
spare
her
purse
one
will
do
mother
i
will
ask
the
good
monks
to
let
me
send
my
copy
of
their
it
is
on
snowy
vellum
and
i
can
write
no
better
so
then
i
shall
only
need
six
sheets
of
vellum
for
my
borders
and
miniatures
and
gold
for
my
ground
and
prime
colours
one
crown
will
do
never
tyne
the
ship
for
want
of
a
bit
of
tar
gerard
said
his
changeable
mother
but
she
added
well
there
i
will
put
the
crown
in
my
pocket
that
wo
be
like
putting
it
back
in
the
box
going
to
the
box
to
take
out
instead
of
putting
in
it
is
like
going
to
my
heart
with
a
knife
for
so
many
drops
of
blood
you
will
be
sure
to
want
it
gerard
the
house
is
never
built
for
less
than
the
builder
counted
sure
enough
when
the
time
came
gerard
longed
to
go
to
rotterdam
and
see
the
duke
and
above
all
to
see
the
work
of
his
competitors
and
so
get
a
lesson
from
defeat
and
the
crown
came
out
of
the
pocket
with
a
very
good
grace
gerard
would
soon
be
a
priest
it
seemed
hard
if
he
might
not
enjoy
the
world
a
little
before
separating
himself
from
it
for
life
the
night
before
he
went
margaret
van
eyck
asked
him
to
take
a
letter
for
her
and
when
he
came
to
look
at
it
to
his
surprise
he
found
it
was
addressed
to
the
princess
marie
at
the
stadthouse
in
rotterdam
the
day
before
the
prizes
were
to
be
distributed
gerard
started
for
rotterdam
in
his
holiday
suit
to
wit
a
doublet
of
cloth
with
sleeves
and
a
jerkin
of
the
same
over
it
but
without
sleeves
from
his
waist
to
his
heels
he
was
clad
in
a
pair
of
buckskin
hose
fastened
by
laces
called
points
to
his
doublet
his
shoes
were
pointed
in
moderation
and
secured
by
a
strap
that
passed
under
the
hollow
of
the
foot
on
his
head
and
the
back
of
his
neck
he
wore
his
flowing
hair
and
pinned
to
his
back
between
his
shoulders
was
his
hat
it
was
further
secured
by
a
purple
silk
ribbon
little
kate
had
passed
round
him
from
the
sides
of
the
hat
and
knotted
neatly
on
his
breast
below
his
hat
attached
to
the
upper
rim
of
his
broad
was
his
leathern
wallet
when
he
got
within
a
league
of
rotterdam
he
was
pretty
tired
but
he
soon
fell
in
with
a
pair
that
were
more
so
he
found
an
old
man
sitting
by
the
roadside
quite
worn
out
and
a
comely
young
woman
holding
his
hand
with
a
face
brimful
of
concern
the
country
people
trudged
by
and
noticed
nothing
amiss
but
gerard
as
he
passed
drew
conclusions
even
dress
tells
a
tale
to
those
who
study
it
so
closely
as
he
did
being
an
illuminator
the
old
man
wore
a
gown
and
a
fur
tippet
and
a
velvet
cap
sure
signs
of
dignity
but
the
triangular
purse
at
his
girdle
was
lean
the
gown
rusty
the
fur
worn
sure
signs
of
poverty
the
young
woman
was
dressed
in
plain
russet
cloth
yet
lawn
covered
that
part
of
her
neck
the
gown
left
visible
and
ended
half
way
up
her
white
throat
in
a
little
band
of
gold
embroidery
and
her
was
new
to
gerard
instead
of
hiding
her
hair
in
a
pile
of
linen
or
lawn
she
wore
an
open
network
of
silver
cord
with
silver
spangles
at
the
interstices
in
this
her
glossy
auburn
hair
was
rolled
in
front
into
two
solid
waves
and
supported
behind
in
a
luxurious
and
shapely
mass
his
quick
eye
took
in
all
this
and
the
old
man
pallor
and
the
tears
in
the
young
woman
eyes
so
when
he
had
passed
them
a
few
yards
he
reflected
and
turned
back
and
came
towards
them
bashfully
father
i
fear
you
are
indeed
my
son
i
am
replied
the
old
man
and
faint
for
lack
of
gerard
address
did
not
appear
so
agreeable
to
the
girl
as
to
the
old
man
she
seemed
ashamed
and
with
much
reserve
in
her
manner
said
that
it
was
her
fault
she
had
underrated
the
distance
and
imprudently
allowed
her
father
to
start
too
late
in
the
day
no
no
said
the
old
man
it
is
not
the
distance
it
is
the
want
of
the
girl
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
with
tender
concern
but
took
that
opportunity
of
whispering
father
a
stranger
a
young
man
but
it
was
too
late
gerard
with
simplicity
and
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
fell
to
gathering
sticks
with
great
expedition
this
done
he
took
down
his
wallet
out
with
the
manchet
of
bread
and
the
iron
flask
his
careful
mother
had
put
up
and
his
everlasting
lighted
a
match
then
a
then
the
sticks
and
put
his
iron
flask
on
it
then
down
he
went
on
his
stomach
and
took
a
good
blow
then
looking
up
he
saw
the
girl
face
had
thawed
and
she
was
looking
down
at
him
and
his
energy
with
a
demure
smile
he
laughed
back
to
her
mind
the
pot
said
he
and
do
let
it
spill
for
heaven
sake
there
a
cleft
stick
to
hold
it
safe
with
and
with
this
he
set
off
running
towards
a
at
some
distance
whilst
he
was
gone
there
came
by
on
a
mule
with
rich
purple
housings
an
old
man
redolent
of
wealth
the
purse
at
his
girdle
was
plethoric
the
fur
on
his
tippet
was
ermine
broad
and
new
it
was
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
the
burgomaster
of
tergou
he
was
old
and
his
face
furrowed
he
was
a
notorious
miser
and
looked
one
generally
but
the
idea
of
supping
with
the
duke
raised
him
just
now
into
manifest
complacency
yet
at
the
sight
of
the
faded
old
man
and
his
bright
daughter
sitting
by
a
fire
of
sticks
the
smile
died
out
of
his
face
and
he
wore
a
strange
look
of
pain
and
uneasiness
he
reined
in
his
mule
why
peter
margaret
said
he
almost
fiercely
what
mummery
is
this
peter
was
going
to
answer
but
margaret
interposed
hastily
and
said
my
father
was
exhausted
so
i
am
warming
something
to
give
him
strength
before
we
go
what
reduced
to
feed
by
the
roadside
like
the
bohemians
said
ghysbrecht
and
his
hand
went
into
his
purse
but
it
did
not
seem
at
home
there
it
fumbled
uncertainly
afraid
too
large
a
coin
might
stick
to
a
finger
and
come
out
at
this
moment
who
should
come
bounding
up
but
gerard
he
had
two
straws
in
his
hand
and
he
threw
himself
down
by
the
fire
and
relieved
margaret
of
the
cooking
part
then
suddenly
recognizing
the
burgomaster
he
coloured
all
over
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
started
and
glared
at
him
and
took
his
hand
out
of
his
purse
oh
said
he
bitterly
i
am
not
wanted
and
went
slowly
on
casting
a
long
look
of
suspicion
on
margaret
and
hostility
on
gerard
that
was
not
very
intelligible
however
there
was
something
about
it
that
margaret
could
read
enough
to
blush
at
and
almost
toss
her
head
gerard
only
stared
with
surprise
by
bavon
i
think
the
old
miser
grudges
us
three
our
quart
of
soup
said
he
when
the
young
man
put
that
interpretation
on
ghysbrecht
strange
and
meaning
look
margaret
was
greatly
relieved
and
smiled
gaily
on
the
speaker
meanwhile
ghysbrecht
plodded
on
more
wretched
in
his
wealth
than
these
in
their
poverty
and
the
curious
thing
is
that
the
mule
the
purple
housings
and
the
coin
in
that
plethoric
purse
belonged
not
to
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
but
to
that
faded
old
man
and
that
comely
girl
who
sat
by
a
roadside
fire
to
be
fed
by
a
stranger
they
did
not
know
this
but
ghysbrecht
knew
it
and
carried
in
his
heart
a
scorpion
of
his
own
begetting
that
scorpion
is
remorse
the
remorse
that
not
being
penitence
is
incurable
and
ready
for
fresh
misdeeds
upon
a
fresh
temptation
twenty
years
ago
when
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
was
a
hard
and
honest
man
the
touchstone
opportunity
came
to
him
and
he
did
an
act
of
heartless
roguery
it
seemed
a
safe
one
it
had
hitherto
proved
a
safe
one
though
he
had
never
felt
safe
he
had
seen
youth
enterprise
and
above
all
knowledge
seated
by
fair
margaret
and
her
father
on
terms
that
look
familiar
and
loving
and
the
fiends
are
at
big
ear
again
chapter
ii
the
soup
is
hot
said
gerard
but
how
are
we
to
get
it
to
our
mouths
inquired
the
senior
despondingly
father
the
young
man
has
brought
us
and
margaret
smiled
slily
ay
ay
said
the
old
man
but
my
poor
bones
are
stiff
and
indeed
the
fire
is
too
hot
for
a
body
to
kneel
over
with
these
short
straws
john
the
baptist
but
the
young
man
is
adroit
for
while
he
stated
his
difficulty
gerard
removed
it
he
untied
in
a
moment
the
knot
on
his
breast
took
his
hat
off
put
a
stone
into
each
corner
of
it
then
wrapping
his
hand
in
the
tail
of
his
jerkin
whipped
the
flask
off
the
fire
wedged
it
in
between
the
stones
and
put
the
hat
under
the
old
man
nose
with
a
merry
smile
the
other
tremulously
inserted
the
pipe
of
and
sucked
lo
and
behold
his
wan
drawn
face
was
seen
to
light
up
more
and
more
till
it
quite
glowed
and
as
soon
as
he
had
drawn
a
long
breath
hippocrates
and
galen
he
cried
is
a
soupe
au
vin
the
restorative
of
restoratives
blessed
be
the
nation
that
invented
it
and
the
woman
that
made
it
and
the
young
man
who
brings
it
to
fainting
folk
have
a
suck
my
girl
while
i
relate
to
our
young
host
the
history
and
virtues
of
this
his
sovereign
compound
this
corroborative
young
sir
was
unknown
to
the
ancients
we
find
it
neither
in
their
treatises
of
medicine
nor
in
those
popular
narratives
which
reveal
many
of
their
remedies
both
in
chirurgery
and
medicine
proper
hector
in
the
ilias
if
my
memory
does
not
play
me
false
margaret
alas
he
was
invited
by
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
poem
to
drink
a
draught
of
wine
but
he
declined
on
the
plea
that
he
was
just
going
into
battle
and
must
not
take
aught
to
weaken
his
powers
now
if
the
soupe
au
vin
had
been
known
in
troy
it
is
clear
that
in
declining
vinum
merum
upon
that
score
he
would
have
added
in
the
hexameter
a
soupe
au
vin
madam
i
will
degust
and
gratefully
not
only
would
this
have
been
but
common
civility
a
virtue
no
perfect
commander
is
wanting
in
but
not
to
have
done
it
would
have
proved
him
a
shallow
and
improvident
person
unfit
to
be
trusted
with
the
conduct
of
a
war
for
men
going
into
a
battle
need
sustenance
and
all
possible
support
as
is
proved
by
this
that
foolish
generals
bringing
hungry
soldiers
to
blows
with
full
ones
have
been
defeated
in
all
ages
by
inferior
numbers
the
romans
lost
a
great
battle
in
the
north
of
italy
to
hannibal
the
carthaginian
by
this
neglect
alone
now
this
divine
elixir
gives
in
one
moment
force
to
the
limbs
and
ardour
to
the
spirits
and
taken
into
hector
body
at
the
nick
of
time
would
by
the
aid
of
phoebus
venus
and
the
blessed
saints
have
most
likely
procured
the
greeks
a
defeat
for
note
how
faint
and
weary
and
i
was
a
minute
ago
well
i
suck
this
celestial
cordial
and
now
behold
me
brave
as
achilles
and
strong
as
an
oh
father
now
an
eagle
alack
girl
i
defy
thee
and
all
the
world
ready
i
say
like
a
foaming
charger
to
devour
the
space
between
this
and
rotterdam
and
strong
to
combat
the
ills
of
life
even
poverty
and
old
age
which
last
philosophers
have
called
the
summum
malum
negatur
unless
the
life
has
been
which
by
the
bye
it
generally
has
now
for
the
moderns
father
dear
father
fear
me
not
girl
i
will
be
brief
unreasonably
and
unseasonably
brief
the
soupe
au
vin
occurs
not
in
modern
science
but
this
is
only
one
proof
more
if
proof
were
needed
that
for
the
last
few
hundred
years
physicians
have
been
idiots
with
their
and
their
decoction
of
gold
whereby
they
attribute
the
highest
qualities
to
that
meat
which
has
the
least
juice
of
any
meat
and
to
that
metal
which
has
less
chemical
qualities
than
all
the
metals
mountebanks
dunces
homicides
since
then
from
these
no
light
is
to
be
gathered
go
we
to
the
chroniclers
and
first
we
find
that
duguesclin
a
french
knight
being
about
to
join
battle
with
the
english
masters
at
that
time
of
half
france
and
sturdy
strikers
by
sea
and
land
drank
not
one
but
three
soupes
au
vin
in
honour
of
the
blessed
trinity
this
done
he
charged
the
islanders
and
as
might
have
been
foretold
killed
a
multitude
and
drove
the
rest
into
the
sea
but
he
was
only
the
first
of
a
long
list
of
holy
and
ones
who
have
by
this
divine
restorative
been
sustentated
fortified
corroborated
and
dear
father
prithee
add
thyself
to
that
venerable
company
ere
the
soup
and
margaret
held
the
hat
imploringly
in
both
hands
till
he
inserted
the
straw
once
more
this
spared
them
the
modern
instances
and
gave
gerard
an
opportunity
of
telling
margaret
how
proud
his
mother
would
be
her
soup
had
profited
a
man
of
learning
ay
but
said
margaret
it
would
like
her
ill
to
see
her
son
give
all
and
take
none
himself
why
brought
you
but
two
straws
fair
mistress
i
hoped
you
would
let
me
put
my
lips
to
your
straw
there
being
but
margaret
smiled
and
blushed
never
beg
that
you
may
command
said
she
the
straw
is
not
mine
is
yours
you
cut
it
in
yonder
i
cut
it
and
that
made
it
mine
but
after
that
your
lip
touched
it
and
that
made
it
did
it
then
i
will
lend
it
you
there
now
it
is
yours
again
your
lip
has
touched
no
it
belongs
to
us
both
now
let
us
divide
by
all
means
you
have
a
no
i
will
not
cut
it
that
would
be
unlucky
i
bite
it
there
i
shall
keep
my
half
you
will
burn
yours
once
you
get
home
i
doubt
you
know
me
not
i
waste
nothing
it
is
odds
but
i
make
a
hairpin
of
it
or
this
answer
dashed
the
novice
gerard
instead
of
provoking
him
to
fresh
efforts
and
he
was
silent
and
now
the
bread
and
soup
being
disposed
of
the
old
scholar
prepared
to
continue
his
journey
then
came
a
little
difficulty
gerard
the
adroit
could
not
tie
his
ribbon
again
as
catherine
had
tied
it
margaret
after
slily
eyeing
his
efforts
for
some
time
offered
to
help
him
for
at
her
age
girls
love
to
be
coy
and
tender
saucy
and
gentle
by
turns
and
she
saw
she
had
put
him
out
of
countenance
but
now
then
a
fair
head
with
its
stately
crown
of
auburn
hair
glossy
and
glowing
through
silver
bowed
sweetly
towards
him
and
while
it
ravished
his
eye
two
white
supple
hands
played
delicately
upon
the
stubborn
ribbon
and
moulded
it
with
soft
and
airy
touches
then
a
heavenly
thrill
ran
through
the
innocent
young
man
and
vague
glimpses
of
a
new
world
of
feeling
and
sentiment
opened
on
him
and
these
new
and
exquisite
sensations
margaret
unwittingly
prolonged
it
is
not
natural
to
her
sex
to
hurry
aught
that
pertains
to
the
sacred
toilet
nay
when
the
taper
fingers
had
at
last
subjugated
the
ends
of
the
knot
her
mind
was
not
quite
easy
till
by
a
manoeuvre
peculiar
to
the
female
hand
she
had
made
her
palm
convex
and
so
applied
it
with
a
gentle
pressure
to
the
centre
of
the
knot
a
sweet
little
coaxing
as
much
as
to
say
now
be
a
good
knot
and
stay
the
was
bestowed
on
the
ribbon
but
the
wearer
heart
leaped
to
meet
it
there
that
is
how
it
was
said
margaret
and
drew
back
to
take
one
last
keen
survey
of
her
work
then
looking
up
for
simple
approval
of
her
skill
received
full
in
her
eyes
a
longing
gaze
of
such
ardent
adoration
as
made
her
lower
them
quickly
and
colour
all
over
an
indescribable
tremor
seized
her
and
she
retreated
with
downcast
lashes
and
cheeks
and
took
her
father
arm
on
the
opposite
side
gerard
blushing
at
having
scared
her
away
with
his
eyes
took
the
other
arm
and
so
the
two
young
things
went
downcast
and
conscious
and
propped
the
eagle
along
in
silence
they
entered
rotterdam
by
the
schiedamze
poort
and
as
gerard
was
unacquainted
with
the
town
peter
directed
him
the
way
to
the
hooch
straet
in
which
the
stadthouse
was
he
himself
was
going
with
margaret
to
his
cousin
in
the
straet
so
almost
on
entering
the
gate
their
roads
lay
apart
they
bade
each
other
a
friendly
adieu
and
gerard
dived
into
the
great
town
a
profound
sense
of
solitude
fell
upon
him
yet
the
streets
were
crowded
then
he
lamented
too
late
that
out
of
delicacy
he
had
not
asked
his
late
companions
who
they
were
and
where
they
lived
beshrew
my
shamefacedness
said
he
but
their
words
and
their
breeding
were
above
their
means
and
something
did
whisper
me
they
would
not
be
known
i
shall
never
see
her
more
oh
weary
world
i
hate
you
and
your
ways
to
think
i
must
meet
beauty
and
goodness
and
learning
three
pearls
of
price
and
never
see
them
more
falling
into
this
sad
reverie
and
letting
his
body
go
where
it
would
he
lost
his
way
but
presently
meeting
a
crowd
of
persons
all
moving
in
one
direction
he
mingled
with
them
for
he
argued
they
must
be
making
for
the
stadthouse
soon
the
noisy
troop
that
contained
the
moody
gerard
emerged
not
upon
the
stadthouse
but
upon
a
large
meadow
by
the
side
of
the
maas
and
then
the
attraction
was
revealed
games
of
all
sorts
were
going
on
wrestling
the
game
of
palm
the
quintain
legerdemain
archery
tumbling
in
which
art
i
blush
to
say
women
as
well
as
men
performed
to
the
great
delectation
of
the
company
there
was
also
a
trained
bear
who
stood
on
his
head
and
marched
upright
and
bowed
with
prodigious
gravity
to
his
master
and
a
hare
that
beat
a
drum
and
a
cock
that
strutted
on
little
stilts
disdainfully
these
things
made
gerard
laugh
now
and
then
but
the
gay
scene
could
not
really
enliven
it
for
his
heart
was
not
in
tune
with
it
so
hearing
a
young
man
say
to
his
fellow
that
the
duke
had
been
in
the
meadow
but
was
gone
to
the
stadthouse
to
entertain
the
burgomasters
and
aldermen
and
the
competitors
for
the
prizes
and
their
friends
he
suddenly
remembered
he
was
hungry
and
should
like
to
sup
with
a
prince
he
left
the
and
this
time
he
found
the
hooch
straet
and
it
speedily
led
him
to
the
stadthouse
but
when
he
got
there
he
was
refused
first
at
one
door
then
at
another
till
he
came
to
the
great
gate
of
the
courtyard
it
was
kept
by
soldiers
and
superintended
by
a
pompous
glittering
in
an
embroidered
collar
and
a
gold
chain
of
office
and
holding
a
white
staff
with
a
gold
knob
there
was
a
crowd
of
persons
at
the
gate
endeavouring
to
soften
this
official
rock
they
came
up
in
turn
like
ripples
and
retired
as
such
in
turn
it
cost
gerard
a
struggle
to
get
near
him
and
when
he
was
within
four
heads
of
the
gate
he
saw
something
that
made
his
heart
beat
there
was
peter
with
margaret
on
his
arm
soliciting
humbly
for
entrance
my
cousin
the
alderman
is
not
at
home
they
say
he
is
what
is
that
to
me
old
man
if
you
will
not
let
us
pass
in
to
him
at
least
take
this
leaf
from
my
tablet
to
my
cousin
see
i
have
written
his
name
he
will
come
out
to
us
for
what
do
you
take
me
i
carry
no
messages
i
keep
the
he
then
bawled
in
a
stentorian
voice
inexorably
no
strangers
enter
here
but
the
competitors
and
their
come
old
man
cried
a
voice
in
the
crowd
you
have
gotten
your
answer
make
margaret
turned
half
round
imploringly
good
people
we
are
come
from
far
and
my
father
is
old
and
my
cousin
has
a
new
servant
that
knows
us
not
and
would
not
let
us
sit
in
our
cousin
at
this
the
crowd
laughed
hoarsely
margaret
shrank
as
if
they
had
struck
her
at
that
moment
a
hand
grasped
hers
a
magic
grasp
it
felt
like
heart
meeting
heart
or
magnet
steel
she
turned
quickly
round
at
it
and
it
was
gerard
such
a
little
cry
of
joy
and
appeal
came
from
her
bosom
and
she
began
to
whimper
prettily
they
had
hustled
her
and
frightened
her
for
one
thing
and
her
thoughtlessness
in
not
even
telling
his
servant
they
were
coming
was
cruel
and
the
servant
caution
however
wise
and
faithful
to
her
master
was
bitterly
mortifying
to
her
father
and
her
and
to
her
so
mortified
and
anxious
and
jostled
came
suddenly
this
kind
hand
and
face
hinc
illae
all
is
well
now
remarked
a
coarse
humourist
she
hath
gotten
her
haw
haw
haw
went
the
crowd
she
dropped
gerard
hand
directly
and
turned
round
with
eyes
flashing
through
her
tears
i
have
no
sweetheart
you
rude
men
but
i
am
friendless
in
your
boorish
town
and
this
is
a
friend
and
one
who
knows
what
you
know
not
how
to
treat
the
aged
and
the
the
crowd
was
dead
silent
they
had
only
been
thoughtless
and
now
felt
the
rebuke
though
severe
was
just
the
silence
enabled
gerard
to
treat
with
the
porter
i
am
a
competitor
what
is
your
name
and
the
man
eyed
him
suspiciously
gerard
the
son
of
the
janitor
inspected
a
slip
of
parchment
he
held
in
his
hand
gerard
eliassoen
can
with
my
company
these
two
nay
those
are
not
your
company
they
came
before
what
matter
they
are
my
friends
and
without
them
i
go
not
stay
without
that
will
i
that
we
shall
we
will
and
and
with
this
gerard
raised
a
voice
of
astounding
volume
and
power
and
routed
so
that
the
whole
street
rang
ho
philip
earl
of
holland
are
you
mad
cried
the
porter
here
is
one
of
your
varlets
defies
hush
hush
and
will
not
let
your
guests
pass
hush
murder
the
dukes
there
i
dead
cried
the
janitor
quaking
then
suddenly
trying
to
overpower
gerard
thunder
he
shouted
with
all
his
lungs
open
the
gate
ye
knaves
way
there
for
gerard
eliassoen
and
his
company
the
fiends
go
with
him
the
gate
swung
open
as
by
magic
eight
soldiers
lowered
their
pikes
halfway
and
made
an
arch
under
which
the
victorious
three
marched
in
triumphant
the
moment
they
had
passed
the
pikes
clashed
together
horizontally
to
bar
the
gateway
and
all
but
pinned
an
abdominal
citizen
that
sought
to
wedge
in
along
with
them
once
past
the
guarded
portal
a
few
steps
brought
the
trio
upon
a
scene
of
oriental
luxury
the
courtyard
was
laid
out
in
tables
loaded
with
rich
meats
and
piled
with
gorgeous
plate
guests
in
rich
and
various
costumes
sat
beneath
a
leafy
canopy
of
branches
fastened
tastefully
to
golden
silver
and
blue
silken
cords
that
traversed
the
area
and
fruits
of
many
hues
including
some
artificial
ones
of
gold
silver
and
wax
hung
pendant
or
peeped
like
fair
eyes
among
the
green
leaves
of
and
the
duke
minstrels
swept
their
lutes
at
intervals
and
a
fountain
played
red
burgundy
in
six
jets
that
met
and
battled
in
the
air
the
evening
sun
darted
its
fires
through
those
bright
and
purple
wine
spouts
making
them
jets
and
cascades
of
molten
rubies
then
passing
on
tinged
with
the
blood
of
the
grape
shed
crimson
glories
here
and
there
on
fair
faces
snowy
beards
velvet
satin
jewelled
hilts
glowing
gold
gleaming
silver
and
sparkling
glass
gerard
and
his
friends
stood
dazzled
presently
a
whisper
buzzed
round
them
salute
the
duke
salute
the
duke
they
looked
up
and
there
on
high
under
the
dais
was
their
sovereign
bidding
them
welcome
with
a
kindly
wave
of
the
hand
the
men
bowed
low
and
margaret
curtsied
with
a
deep
and
graceful
obeisance
the
hand
being
up
he
gave
it
another
turn
and
pointed
the
out
to
a
knot
of
valets
instantly
seven
of
his
people
with
an
obedient
start
went
headlong
at
our
friends
seated
them
at
a
table
and
put
fifteen
soups
before
them
in
little
silver
bowls
and
as
many
wines
in
crystal
vases
nay
father
let
us
not
eat
until
we
have
thanked
our
good
friend
said
margaret
now
first
recovering
from
all
this
bustle
girl
he
is
our
guardian
gerard
put
his
face
into
his
hands
tell
me
when
you
have
done
said
he
and
i
will
reappear
and
have
my
supper
for
i
am
hungry
i
know
which
of
us
three
is
the
happiest
at
meeting
me
inquired
margaret
no
guess
father
then
i
have
no
guess
which
it
can
be
and
she
gave
a
little
crow
of
happiness
and
gaiety
the
soup
was
tasted
and
vanished
in
a
twirl
of
fourteen
hands
and
fish
came
on
the
table
in
a
dozen
forms
with
patties
of
lobster
and
almonds
mixed
and
of
almonds
and
cream
and
an
immense
variety
of
brouets
known
to
us
as
rissoles
the
next
trifle
was
a
wild
boar
which
smelt
divine
why
then
did
margaret
start
away
from
it
with
two
shrieks
of
dismay
and
pinch
so
good
a
friend
as
gerard
because
the
duke
cuisinier
had
been
too
clever
had
made
this
excellent
dish
too
captivating
to
the
sight
as
well
as
taste
he
had
restored
to
the
animal
by
elaborate
mimicry
with
burnt
sugar
and
other
edible
colours
the
hair
and
bristles
he
had
robbed
him
of
by
fire
and
water
to
make
him
still
more
enticing
the
huge
tusks
were
carefully
preserved
in
the
brute
jaw
and
gave
his
mouth
the
winning
smile
that
comes
of
tusk
in
man
or
beast
and
two
eyes
of
coloured
sugar
glowed
in
his
head
argus
what
eyes
so
bright
so
bloodshot
so
threatening
they
followed
a
man
and
every
movement
of
his
knife
and
spoon
but
indeed
i
need
the
pencil
of
granville
or
tenniel
to
make
you
see
the
two
gilt
valets
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
putting
the
monster
down
before
our
friends
with
a
smiling
benevolent
obsequiousness
for
this
ghastly
monster
was
the
flower
of
all
comestibles
old
peter
clasping
both
hands
in
pious
admiration
of
it
margaret
wheeling
round
with
eyes
and
her
hand
on
gerard
shoulder
squeaking
and
pinching
his
face
of
unwise
delight
at
being
pinched
the
grizzly
brute
glaring
sulkily
on
all
and
the
guests
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
what
to
do
shouted
the
duke
hearing
the
signals
of
female
distress
seven
of
his
people
with
a
zealous
start
went
headlong
and
told
him
he
laughed
and
said
give
her
of
the
then
and
bring
me
sir
benevolent
monarch
the
was
his
own
private
dish
on
these
grand
occasions
an
ox
was
roasted
whole
and
reserved
for
the
poor
but
this
wise
as
well
as
charitable
prince
had
discovered
that
whatever
venison
bares
lamb
poultry
you
skewered
into
that
beef
cavern
got
cooked
to
perfection
retaining
their
own
juices
and
receiving
those
of
the
reeking
ox
these
he
called
his
and
took
delight
therein
as
did
now
our
trio
for
at
his
word
seven
of
his
people
went
headlong
and
drove
silver
tridents
into
the
steaming
cave
at
random
and
speared
a
kid
a
cygnet
and
a
flock
of
wildfowl
these
presently
smoked
before
gerard
and
company
and
peter
face
sad
and
slightly
morose
at
the
loss
of
the
savage
hog
expanded
and
shone
after
this
twenty
different
tarts
of
fruits
and
herbs
and
last
of
all
confectionery
on
a
titanic
scale
cathedrals
of
sugar
all
gilt
painted
in
the
interstices
of
the
castles
with
moats
and
ditches
imitated
to
the
life
elephants
camels
toads
knights
on
horseback
jousting
kings
and
princesses
looking
on
trumpeters
blowing
and
all
these
personages
eating
and
their
veins
filled
with
juices
works
of
art
made
to
be
destroyed
the
guests
breached
a
bastion
crunched
a
crusader
and
his
horse
and
lance
or
cracked
a
bishop
cope
chasuble
crosier
and
all
as
remorselessly
as
we
do
a
caraway
comfit
sipping
meanwhile
hippocras
and
other
spiced
drinks
and
greek
and
corsican
wines
while
every
now
and
then
little
turkish
boys
turbaned
spangled
jewelled
and
gilt
came
offering
on
bended
knee
golden
troughs
of
and
to
keep
the
guests
hands
cool
and
perfumed
but
long
before
our
party
arrived
at
this
final
stage
appetite
had
succumbed
and
gerard
had
suddenly
remembered
he
was
the
bearer
of
a
letter
to
the
princess
marie
and
in
an
had
asked
one
of
the
servants
if
he
would
undertake
to
deliver
it
the
man
took
it
with
a
deep
obeisance
he
could
not
deliver
it
himself
but
would
instantly
give
it
one
of
the
princess
suite
several
of
whom
were
it
may
be
remembered
that
peter
and
margaret
came
here
not
to
dine
but
to
find
their
cousin
well
the
old
gentleman
ate
heartily
and
being
much
fatigued
dropped
asleep
and
forgot
all
about
his
cousin
margaret
did
not
remind
him
we
shall
hear
why
meanwhile
that
cousin
was
seated
within
a
few
feet
of
them
at
their
backs
and
discovered
them
when
margaret
turned
round
and
screamed
at
the
boar
but
he
forbore
to
speak
to
them
for
municipal
reasons
margaret
was
very
plainly
dressed
and
peter
inclined
to
threadbare
so
the
alderman
said
to
himself
be
time
to
make
up
to
them
when
the
sun
sets
and
the
company
disperses
then
i
will
take
my
poor
relations
to
my
house
and
none
will
be
the
half
the
courses
were
lost
on
gerard
and
margaret
they
were
no
great
eaters
and
just
now
were
feeding
on
sweet
thoughts
that
have
ever
been
unfavourable
to
appetite
but
there
is
a
delicate
kind
of
sensuality
to
whose
influence
these
two
were
perhaps
more
sensitive
than
any
other
pair
in
that
assembly
the
delights
of
colour
music
and
perfume
all
of
which
blended
so
fascinatingly
here
margaret
leaned
back
and
half
closed
her
eyes
and
murmured
to
gerard
what
a
lovely
scene
the
warm
sun
the
green
shade
the
rich
dresses
the
bright
music
of
the
lutes
and
the
cool
music
of
the
fountain
and
all
faces
so
happy
and
gay
and
then
it
is
to
you
we
owe
gerard
was
silent
all
but
his
eyes
observing
which
now
speak
not
to
me
said
margaret
languidly
let
me
listen
to
the
fountain
what
are
you
a
competitor
for
he
told
her
very
well
you
will
gain
one
prize
at
which
which
have
you
seen
any
of
my
work
i
no
but
you
will
gain
a
prize
i
hope
so
but
what
makes
you
think
so
because
you
were
so
good
to
my
gerard
smiled
at
the
feminine
logic
and
hung
his
head
at
the
sweet
praise
and
was
silent
speak
not
murmured
margaret
they
say
this
is
a
world
of
sin
and
misery
can
that
be
what
is
your
opinion
no
that
is
all
a
silly
old
song
explained
gerard
is
a
byword
our
elders
keep
repeating
out
of
custom
it
is
not
how
can
you
know
you
are
but
a
child
said
margaret
with
pensive
dignity
why
only
look
round
and
then
thought
i
had
lost
you
for
ever
and
you
are
by
my
side
and
now
the
minstrels
are
going
to
play
again
sin
and
misery
stuff
and
nonsense
the
lutes
burst
out
the
courtyard
rang
again
with
their
delicate
harmony
what
do
you
admire
most
of
all
these
beautiful
things
gerard
you
know
my
name
how
is
that
white
magic
i
am
a
angels
are
never
witches
but
i
ca
think
how
you
foolish
boy
was
it
not
cried
at
the
gate
loud
enough
to
deave
one
so
it
was
where
is
my
head
what
do
i
admire
most
if
you
will
sit
a
little
more
that
way
i
tell
this
way
yes
so
that
the
light
may
fall
on
you
there
i
see
many
fair
things
here
fairer
than
i
could
have
conceived
but
the
fairest
of
all
to
my
eye
is
your
lovely
hair
in
its
silver
frame
and
the
setting
sun
kissing
it
it
minds
me
of
what
the
vulgate
praises
for
beauty
apple
of
gold
in
a
network
of
silver
and
oh
what
a
pity
i
did
not
know
you
before
i
sent
in
my
poor
endeavours
at
illuminating
i
could
illuminate
so
much
better
now
i
could
do
everything
better
there
now
the
sun
is
full
on
it
it
is
like
an
aureole
so
our
lady
looked
and
none
since
her
until
oh
fie
it
is
wicked
to
talk
so
compare
a
poor
girl
like
me
with
the
queen
of
heaven
oh
gerard
i
thought
you
were
a
good
young
and
margaret
was
shocked
apparently
gerard
tried
to
explain
i
am
no
worse
than
the
rest
but
how
can
i
help
having
eyes
and
a
heart
margaret
gerard
be
not
angry
now
now
is
it
likely
i
love
oh
for
shame
you
must
not
say
that
to
me
and
margaret
coloured
furiously
at
this
sudden
assault
i
ca
help
it
i
love
you
i
love
hush
hush
for
pity
sake
i
must
not
listen
to
such
words
from
a
stranger
i
am
ungrateful
to
call
you
a
stranger
oh
how
one
may
be
mistaken
if
i
had
known
you
were
so
bold
and
margaret
bosom
began
to
heave
and
her
cheeks
were
covered
with
blushes
and
she
looked
towards
her
sleeping
father
very
much
like
a
timid
thing
that
meditates
actual
flight
then
gerard
was
frightened
at
the
alarm
he
caused
forgive
me
said
he
imploringly
how
could
any
one
help
loving
you
well
sir
i
will
try
and
forgive
you
you
are
so
good
in
other
respects
but
then
you
must
promise
me
never
to
say
you
to
say
that
give
me
your
hand
then
or
you
do
forgive
she
hesitated
but
eventually
put
out
her
hand
a
very
little
way
very
slowly
and
with
seeming
reluctance
he
took
it
and
held
it
prisoner
when
she
thought
it
had
been
there
long
enough
she
tried
gently
to
draw
it
away
he
held
it
tight
it
submitted
quite
patiently
to
force
what
is
the
use
resisting
force
she
turned
her
head
away
and
her
long
eyelashes
drooped
sweetly
gerard
lost
nothing
by
his
promise
words
were
not
needed
here
and
silence
was
more
eloquent
nature
was
in
that
day
what
she
is
in
ours
but
manners
were
somewhat
freer
then
as
now
virgins
drew
back
alarmed
at
the
first
words
of
love
but
of
prudery
and
artificial
coquetry
there
was
little
and
the
young
soon
read
one
another
hearts
everything
was
on
gerard
side
his
good
looks
her
belief
in
his
goodness
her
gratitude
and
opportunity
for
at
the
banquet
this
mellow
summer
eve
all
things
disposed
the
female
nature
to
tenderness
the
avenues
to
the
heart
lay
open
the
senses
were
so
soothed
and
subdued
with
lovely
colours
gentle
sounds
and
delicate
odours
the
sun
gently
sinking
the
warm
air
the
green
canopy
the
cool
music
of
the
now
violet
fountain
gerard
and
margaret
sat
hand
in
hand
in
silence
and
gerard
eyes
sought
hers
lovingly
and
hers
now
and
then
turned
on
him
timidly
and
imploringly
and
presently
two
sweet
unreasonable
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
and
she
smiled
while
they
were
drying
yet
they
did
not
take
long
and
the
sun
declined
and
the
air
cooled
and
the
fountain
plashed
more
gently
and
the
pair
throbbed
in
unison
and
silence
and
this
weary
world
looked
heaven
to
them
oh
the
merry
days
the
merry
days
when
we
were
young
oh
the
merry
days
the
merry
days
when
we
were
young
chapter
iii
a
grave
seneschal
came
to
their
table
and
inquired
courteously
whether
gerard
eliassoen
was
of
their
company
upon
answer
he
said
the
princess
marie
would
confer
with
you
young
sir
i
am
to
conduct
you
to
her
instantly
all
faces
within
hearing
turned
sharp
round
and
were
bent
with
curiosity
and
envy
on
the
man
that
was
to
go
to
a
princess
gerard
rose
to
obey
i
wager
we
shall
not
see
you
again
said
margaret
calmly
but
colouring
a
little
that
you
will
was
the
reply
then
he
whispered
in
her
ear
this
is
my
good
princess
but
you
are
my
he
added
aloud
wait
for
me
i
pray
you
i
will
presently
ay
ay
said
peter
awaking
and
speaking
at
one
and
the
same
moment
gerard
gone
the
pair
whose
dress
was
so
homely
yet
they
were
with
the
man
whom
the
princess
sent
for
became
the
cynosure
of
neighbouring
eyes
observing
which
william
johnson
came
forward
acted
surprise
and
claimed
his
relations
and
to
think
that
there
was
i
at
your
backs
and
you
saw
me
not
nay
cousin
johnson
i
saw
you
long
syne
said
margaret
coldly
you
saw
me
and
spoke
not
to
me
cousin
it
was
for
you
to
welcome
us
to
rotterdam
as
it
is
for
us
to
welcome
you
at
sevenbergen
your
servant
denied
us
a
seat
in
your
the
idiot
and
i
had
a
mind
to
see
whether
it
was
maid
like
master
for
there
is
sooth
in
william
johnson
blushed
purple
he
saw
margaret
was
keen
and
suspected
him
he
did
the
wisest
thing
under
the
circumstances
trusted
to
deeds
not
words
he
insisted
on
their
coming
home
with
him
at
once
and
he
would
show
them
whether
they
were
welcome
to
rotterdam
or
not
who
doubts
it
cousin
who
doubts
it
said
the
scholar
margaret
thanked
him
graciously
but
demurred
to
go
just
now
said
she
wanted
to
hear
the
minstrels
again
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
johnson
renewed
his
proposal
and
bade
her
observe
that
many
of
the
guests
had
left
then
her
real
reason
came
out
it
were
ill
manners
to
our
friend
and
he
will
lose
us
he
knows
not
where
we
lodge
in
rotterdam
and
the
city
is
large
and
we
have
parted
company
once
oh
said
johnson
we
will
provide
for
that
my
young
man
ahem
i
mean
my
secretary
shall
sit
here
and
wait
and
bring
him
on
to
my
house
he
shall
lodge
with
me
and
with
no
cousin
we
shall
be
too
nay
nay
you
shall
see
whether
you
are
welcome
or
not
you
and
your
friends
and
your
friends
friends
if
need
be
and
i
shall
hear
what
the
princess
would
with
margaret
felt
a
thrill
of
joy
that
gerard
should
be
lodged
under
the
same
roof
with
her
then
she
had
a
slight
misgiving
but
if
your
young
man
should
be
thoughtless
and
go
play
and
gerard
miss
him
he
go
play
he
leave
that
spot
where
i
put
him
and
bid
him
stay
ho
stand
forth
hans
a
figure
clad
in
black
serge
and
dark
violet
hose
arose
and
took
two
steps
and
stood
before
them
without
moving
a
muscle
a
solemn
precise
young
man
the
very
statue
of
gravity
and
starched
propriety
at
his
aspect
margaret
being
very
happy
could
hardly
keep
her
countenance
but
she
whispered
johnson
i
would
put
my
hand
in
the
fire
for
him
we
are
at
your
command
cousin
as
soon
as
you
have
given
him
his
hans
was
then
instructed
to
sit
at
the
table
and
wait
for
gerard
and
conduct
him
to
straet
he
replied
not
in
words
but
by
calmly
taking
the
seat
indicated
and
margaret
peter
and
william
johnson
went
away
together
and
indeed
it
is
time
you
were
abed
father
after
all
your
travel
said
margaret
this
had
been
in
her
mind
all
along
hans
cloterman
sat
waiting
for
gerard
solemn
and
businesslike
the
minutes
flew
by
but
excited
no
impatience
in
that
perfect
young
man
johnson
did
him
no
more
than
justice
when
he
laughed
to
scorn
the
idea
of
his
secretary
leaving
his
post
or
neglecting
his
duty
in
pursuit
of
sport
or
out
of
youthful
hilarity
and
frivolity
as
gerard
was
long
in
coming
the
patient
hans
his
employer
eye
being
no
longer
on
him
improved
the
time
by
quaffing
solemnly
silently
and
at
short
but
accurately
measured
intervals
goblets
of
corsican
wine
the
wine
was
strong
so
was
cloterman
head
and
gerard
had
been
gone
a
good
hour
ere
the
model
secretary
imbibed
the
notion
that
creation
expected
cloterman
to
drink
the
health
of
all
good
fellows
and
nommement
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
there
present
with
this
view
he
filled
bumper
nine
and
rose
gingerly
but
solemnly
and
slowly
having
reached
his
full
height
he
instantly
rolled
upon
the
grass
goblet
in
hand
spilling
the
cold
liquor
on
more
than
one
ankle
whose
owners
frisked
but
not
disturbing
a
muscle
in
his
own
long
face
which
in
the
total
eclipse
of
reason
retained
its
gravity
primness
and
infallibility
the
seneschal
led
gerard
through
several
passages
to
the
door
of
the
pavilion
where
some
young
noblemen
embroidered
and
feathered
sat
sentinel
guarding
the
and
playing
cards
by
the
red
light
of
torches
their
servants
held
a
whisper
from
the
seneschal
and
one
of
them
rose
reluctantly
stared
at
gerard
with
haughty
surprise
and
entered
the
pavilion
he
presently
returned
and
beckoning
the
pair
led
then
through
a
passage
or
two
and
landed
them
in
an
where
sat
three
more
young
gentlemen
feathered
furred
and
embroidered
like
pieces
of
fancy
work
and
deep
in
that
instructive
and
edifying
branch
of
learning
dice
you
ca
see
the
princess
it
is
too
late
said
one
another
followed
suit
she
passed
this
way
but
now
with
her
nurse
she
is
gone
to
bed
doll
and
all
deuce
ace
again
gerard
prepared
to
retire
the
seneschal
with
an
incredulous
smile
replied
the
young
man
is
here
by
the
countess
orders
be
so
good
as
conduct
him
to
her
on
this
a
superb
adonis
rose
with
an
injured
look
and
led
gerard
into
a
room
where
sat
or
lolloped
eleven
ladies
chattering
like
magpies
two
more
industrious
than
the
rest
were
playing
with
fingers
as
nimble
as
their
tongues
at
the
sight
of
a
stranger
all
the
tongues
stopped
like
one
piece
of
complicated
machinery
and
all
the
eyes
turned
on
gerard
as
if
the
same
string
that
checked
the
tongues
had
turned
the
eyes
on
gerard
was
ill
at
ease
before
but
this
battery
of
eyes
discountenanced
him
and
down
went
his
eyes
on
the
ground
then
the
cowards
finding
like
the
hare
who
ran
by
the
pond
and
the
frogs
scuttled
into
the
water
that
there
was
a
creature
they
could
frighten
giggled
and
enjoyed
their
prowess
then
a
duenna
said
severely
mesdames
and
they
were
all
abashed
at
once
as
though
a
modesty
string
had
been
pulled
this
same
duenna
took
gerard
and
marched
before
him
in
solemn
silence
the
young
man
heart
sank
and
he
had
half
a
mind
to
turn
and
run
out
of
the
place
what
must
princes
be
he
thought
when
their
courtiers
are
so
freezing
doubtless
they
take
their
breeding
from
him
they
these
reflections
were
interrupted
by
the
duenna
suddenly
introducing
him
into
a
room
where
three
ladies
sat
working
and
a
pretty
little
girl
tuning
a
lute
the
ladies
were
richly
but
not
showily
dressed
and
the
duenna
went
up
to
the
one
who
was
hemming
a
kerchief
and
said
a
few
words
in
a
low
tone
this
lady
then
turned
towards
gerard
with
a
smile
and
beckoned
him
to
come
near
her
she
did
not
rise
but
she
laid
aside
her
work
and
her
manner
of
turning
towards
him
slight
as
the
movement
was
was
full
of
grace
and
ease
and
courtesy
she
began
a
conversation
at
once
margaret
van
eyck
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
sir
and
i
am
right
glad
to
have
a
letter
from
her
hand
and
thankful
to
you
sir
for
bringing
it
to
me
safely
marie
my
love
this
is
the
gentleman
who
brought
you
that
pretty
sir
i
thank
you
a
thousand
times
said
the
young
lady
i
am
glad
you
feel
her
debtor
sweetheart
for
our
friend
would
have
us
to
do
him
a
little
service
in
return
i
will
do
anything
on
earth
for
him
replied
the
young
lady
with
ardour
anything
on
earth
is
nothing
in
the
world
said
the
countess
of
charolois
quietly
well
then
i
will
what
would
you
have
me
to
do
sir
gerard
had
just
found
out
what
high
society
he
was
in
my
sovereign
demoiselle
said
he
gently
and
a
little
tremulously
where
there
have
been
no
pains
there
needs
no
but
we
must
obey
mamma
all
the
world
must
obey
that
is
true
then
our
demoiselle
reward
me
if
you
will
by
letting
me
hear
the
stave
you
were
going
to
sing
and
i
did
interrupt
what
you
love
music
sir
i
adore
the
little
princess
looked
inquiringly
at
her
mother
and
received
a
smile
of
assent
she
then
took
her
lute
and
sang
a
romaunt
of
the
day
although
but
twelve
years
old
she
was
a
and
painstaking
musician
her
little
claw
swept
the
chords
with
courage
and
precision
and
struck
out
the
notes
of
the
arpeggio
clear
and
distinct
and
bright
like
twinkling
stars
but
the
main
charm
was
her
voice
it
was
not
mighty
but
it
was
round
clear
full
and
ringing
like
a
bell
she
sang
with
a
certain
modest
eloquence
though
she
knew
none
of
the
tricks
of
feeling
she
was
too
young
to
be
theatrical
or
even
sentimental
so
nothing
was
forced
all
gushed
her
little
mouth
seemed
the
mouth
of
nature
the
ditty
too
was
as
pure
as
its
utterance
as
there
were
none
of
those
false
divisions
those
whining
slurs
which
are
now
sold
so
dear
by
italian
songsters
though
every
jackal
in
india
delivers
them
gratis
to
his
customers
all
night
and
sometimes
gets
shot
for
them
and
always
deserves
it
so
there
were
no
cadences
and
fiorituri
the
trite
turgid
and
feeble
expletives
of
song
the
with
which
mindless
musicians
and
mindless
writers
quench
fire
wash
out
colour
and
drown
melody
and
meaning
dead
while
the
pure
and
tender
strain
was
flowing
from
the
pure
young
throat
gerard
eyes
filled
the
countess
watched
him
with
interest
for
it
was
usual
to
applaud
the
princess
loudly
but
not
with
cheek
and
eye
so
when
the
voice
ceased
and
the
glasses
left
off
ringing
she
asked
demurely
was
he
content
gerard
gave
a
little
start
the
spoken
voice
broke
a
charm
and
brought
him
back
to
earth
oh
madam
he
cried
surely
it
is
thus
that
cherubs
and
seraphs
sing
and
charm
the
saints
in
i
am
somewhat
of
your
opinion
my
young
friend
said
the
countess
with
emotion
and
she
bent
a
look
of
love
and
gentle
pride
upon
her
girl
a
heavenly
look
such
as
they
say
is
given
to
the
eye
of
the
resting
on
the
the
countess
resumed
my
old
friend
request
me
to
be
serviceable
to
you
it
is
the
first
favour
she
has
done
us
the
honour
of
asking
us
and
the
request
is
sacred
you
are
in
holy
orders
sir
gerard
bowed
i
fear
you
are
not
a
priest
you
look
too
oh
no
madam
i
am
not
even
a
i
am
only
a
lector
but
next
month
i
shall
be
an
exorcist
and
before
long
an
well
monsieur
gerard
with
your
accomplishments
you
can
soon
pass
through
the
inferior
orders
and
let
me
beg
you
to
do
so
for
the
day
after
you
have
said
your
first
mass
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
appointing
you
to
a
oh
madam
and
marie
remember
i
make
this
promise
in
your
name
as
well
as
my
fear
not
mamma
i
will
not
forget
but
if
he
will
take
my
advice
what
he
will
be
is
bishop
of
liege
the
bishop
of
liege
is
a
beautiful
bishop
what
do
you
not
remember
him
mamma
that
day
we
were
at
liege
he
was
braver
than
grandpapa
himself
he
had
on
a
crown
a
high
one
and
it
was
cut
in
the
middle
and
it
was
full
of
oh
such
beautiful
jewels
and
his
gown
stiff
with
gold
and
his
mantle
too
and
it
had
a
broad
border
all
pictures
but
above
all
his
gloves
you
have
no
such
gloves
mamma
they
were
embroidered
and
covered
with
jewels
and
scented
with
such
lovely
scent
i
smelt
them
all
the
time
he
was
giving
me
his
blessing
on
my
head
with
them
dear
old
man
i
dare
say
he
will
die
soon
most
old
people
do
and
then
sir
you
can
be
bishop
you
know
and
wear
gently
marie
gently
bishoprics
are
for
old
gentlemen
and
this
is
a
young
mamma
he
is
not
so
very
young
not
compared
with
you
marie
eh
he
is
a
good
birth
dear
mamma
and
i
am
sure
he
is
good
enough
for
a
bishop
alas
mademoiselle
you
are
mistaken
i
know
not
that
monsieur
gerard
but
i
am
a
little
puzzled
to
know
on
what
grounds
mademoiselle
there
pronounces
your
character
so
alas
mamma
said
the
princess
you
have
not
looked
at
his
face
then
and
she
raised
her
eyebrows
at
her
mother
simplicity
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
countess
i
have
well
sir
if
i
can
not
go
quite
so
fast
as
my
daughter
attribute
it
to
my
age
not
to
a
want
of
interest
in
your
welfare
a
benefice
will
do
to
begin
your
career
with
and
i
must
take
care
it
is
not
too
far
from
what
call
you
the
place
tergou
madam
a
priest
gives
up
much
continued
the
countess
often
i
fear
he
learns
too
late
how
much
and
her
woman
eye
rested
a
moment
on
gerard
with
mild
pity
and
half
surprise
at
his
resigning
her
sex
and
all
the
heaven
they
can
bestow
and
the
great
parental
joys
at
least
you
shall
be
near
your
friends
have
you
a
mother
yes
madam
thanks
be
to
god
good
you
shall
have
a
church
near
tergou
she
will
thank
me
and
now
sir
we
must
not
detain
you
too
long
from
those
who
have
a
better
claim
on
your
society
than
we
have
duchess
oblige
me
by
bidding
one
of
the
pages
conduct
him
to
the
hall
of
banquet
the
way
is
hard
to
gerard
bowed
low
to
the
countess
and
the
princess
and
backed
towards
the
door
i
hope
it
will
be
a
nice
benefice
said
the
princess
to
him
with
a
pretty
smile
as
he
was
going
out
then
shaking
her
head
with
an
air
of
solemn
misgiving
but
you
had
better
have
been
bishop
of
gerard
followed
his
new
conductor
his
heart
warm
with
gratitude
but
ere
he
reached
the
a
chill
came
over
him
the
mind
of
one
who
has
led
a
quiet
uneventful
life
is
not
apt
to
take
in
contradictory
feelings
at
the
same
moment
and
balance
them
but
rather
to
be
overpowered
by
each
in
turn
while
gerard
was
with
the
countess
the
excitement
of
so
new
a
situation
the
promise
the
joy
and
pride
it
would
cause
at
home
possessed
him
wholly
but
now
it
was
passion
turn
to
be
heard
again
what
give
up
margaret
whose
soft
hand
he
still
felt
in
his
and
her
deep
eyes
in
his
heart
resign
her
and
all
the
world
of
love
and
joy
she
had
opened
on
him
the
revulsion
when
it
did
come
was
so
strong
that
he
hastily
resolved
to
say
nothing
at
home
about
the
offered
benefice
the
countess
is
so
good
thought
he
she
has
a
hundred
ways
of
aiding
a
young
fortune
she
will
not
compel
me
to
be
a
priest
when
she
shall
learn
i
love
one
of
her
sex
one
would
almost
think
she
does
know
it
for
she
cast
a
strange
look
on
me
and
said
priest
gives
up
much
too
much
i
dare
say
she
will
give
me
a
place
about
the
and
with
this
hopeful
reflection
his
mind
was
eased
and
being
now
at
the
entrance
of
the
banqueting
hall
he
thanked
his
conductor
and
ran
hastily
with
joyful
eyes
to
margaret
he
came
in
sight
of
the
table
she
was
gone
peter
was
gone
too
nobody
was
at
the
table
at
all
only
a
citizen
in
sober
garments
had
just
tumbled
under
it
dead
drunk
and
several
persons
were
raising
him
to
carry
him
away
gerard
never
guessed
how
important
this
solemn
drunkard
was
to
him
he
was
looking
for
beauty
and
let
the
beast
lie
he
ran
wildly
round
the
hall
which
was
now
comparatively
empty
she
was
not
there
he
left
the
palace
outside
he
found
a
crowd
gaping
at
two
great
just
lighted
over
the
gate
he
asked
them
earnestly
if
they
had
seen
an
old
man
in
a
gown
and
a
lovely
girl
pass
out
they
laughed
at
the
question
they
were
staring
at
these
new
lights
that
turn
night
into
day
they
did
trouble
their
heads
about
old
men
and
young
wenches
from
another
group
he
learned
there
was
a
mystery
being
played
under
canvas
hard
by
and
all
the
world
gone
to
see
it
this
revived
his
hopes
and
he
went
and
saw
the
mystery
in
this
representation
divine
personages
too
sacred
for
me
to
name
here
came
clumsily
down
from
heaven
to
talk
sophistry
with
the
cardinal
virtues
the
nine
muses
and
the
seven
deadly
sins
all
present
in
human
shape
and
not
unlike
one
another
to
enliven
which
weary
stuff
in
rattled
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
and
an
imp
that
kept
molesting
him
and
buffeting
him
with
a
bladder
at
each
thwack
of
which
the
crowd
were
in
ecstasies
when
the
vices
had
uttered
good
store
of
obscenity
and
the
virtues
twaddle
the
celestials
including
the
nine
muses
went
gingerly
back
to
heaven
one
by
one
for
there
was
but
one
cloud
and
two
artisans
worked
it
up
with
its
supernatural
freight
and
worked
it
down
with
a
winch
in
full
sight
of
the
audience
these
disposed
of
the
bottomless
pit
opened
and
flamed
in
the
centre
of
the
stage
the
carpenters
and
virtues
shoved
the
vices
in
and
the
virtues
and
beelzebub
and
his
tormentor
danced
merrily
round
the
place
of
eternal
torture
to
the
fife
and
tabor
this
entertainment
was
writ
by
the
bishop
of
ghent
for
the
diffusion
of
religious
sentiment
by
the
aid
of
the
senses
and
was
an
average
specimen
of
theatrical
exhibitions
so
long
as
they
were
in
the
hands
of
the
clergy
but
in
course
of
time
the
laity
conducted
plays
and
so
the
theatre
i
learn
from
the
pulpit
has
become
profane
margaret
was
nowhere
in
the
crowd
and
gerard
could
not
enjoy
the
performance
he
actually
went
away
in
act
in
the
midst
of
a
piece
of
dialogue
in
which
justice
satan
he
walked
through
many
streets
but
could
not
find
her
he
sought
at
last
fairly
worn
out
he
went
to
a
hostelry
and
slept
till
daybreak
all
that
day
heavy
and
heartsick
he
sought
her
but
could
never
fall
in
with
her
or
her
father
nor
ever
obtain
the
slightest
clue
then
he
felt
she
was
false
or
had
changed
her
mind
he
was
irritated
now
as
well
as
sad
more
good
fortune
fell
on
him
he
almost
hated
it
at
last
on
the
third
day
after
he
had
once
more
been
through
every
street
he
said
she
is
not
in
the
town
and
i
shall
never
see
her
again
i
will
go
he
started
for
tergou
with
royal
favour
promised
with
fifteen
golden
angels
in
his
purse
a
golden
medal
on
his
bosom
and
a
heart
like
a
lump
of
lead
chapter
iv
it
was
near
four
in
the
afternoon
eli
was
in
the
shop
his
eldest
and
youngest
sons
were
abroad
catherine
and
her
little
crippled
daughter
had
long
been
anxious
about
gerard
and
now
they
were
gone
a
little
way
down
the
road
to
see
if
by
good
luck
he
might
be
visible
in
the
distance
and
giles
was
alone
in
the
which
i
will
sketch
furniture
and
dwarf
included
the
hollanders
were
always
an
original
and
leading
people
they
claim
to
have
invented
printing
wooden
type
liberty
banking
gardening
etc
above
all
years
before
my
tale
they
invented
cleanliness
so
while
the
english
gentry
in
velvet
jerkins
and
shoes
trode
floors
of
stale
rushes
foul
receptacle
of
bones
decomposing
morsels
spittle
dogs
eggs
and
all
abominations
this
hosier
at
tergou
was
floored
with
dutch
tiles
so
highly
glazed
and
constantly
washed
that
you
could
eat
off
them
there
was
one
large
window
the
cross
in
the
centre
of
it
was
very
massive
and
stood
in
relief
looking
like
an
actual
cross
to
the
inmates
and
was
eyed
as
such
in
their
devotions
the
panes
were
very
small
and
and
soldered
to
one
another
with
strips
of
lead
the
like
you
may
see
to
this
day
in
our
rural
cottages
the
chairs
were
rude
and
primitive
all
but
the
whose
back
at
right
angles
with
its
seat
was
so
high
that
the
sitter
head
stopped
two
feet
short
of
the
top
this
chair
was
of
oak
and
carved
at
the
summit
there
was
a
copper
pail
that
went
in
at
the
waist
holding
holy
water
and
a
little
to
sprinkle
it
far
and
wide
and
a
long
narrow
but
massive
oak
table
and
a
dwarf
sticking
to
its
rim
by
his
teeth
his
eyes
glaring
and
his
claws
in
the
air
like
a
pouncing
vampire
nature
it
would
seem
did
not
make
giles
a
dwarf
out
of
malice
prepense
she
constructed
a
head
and
torso
with
her
usual
care
but
just
then
her
attention
was
distracted
and
she
left
the
rest
to
chance
the
result
was
a
human
wedge
an
inverted
cone
he
might
justly
have
taken
her
to
task
in
the
terms
of
horace
amphora
coepit
institui
currente
rota
cur
urceus
exit
his
centre
was
anything
but
his
centre
of
gravity
bisected
upper
giles
would
have
outweighed
three
lower
giles
but
this
very
disproportion
enabled
him
to
do
feats
that
would
have
baffled
milo
his
brawny
arms
had
no
weight
to
draw
after
them
so
he
could
go
up
a
vertical
pole
like
a
squirrel
and
hang
for
hours
from
a
bough
by
one
hand
like
a
cherry
by
its
stalk
if
he
could
have
made
a
vacuum
with
his
hands
as
the
lizard
is
said
to
do
with
its
feet
he
would
have
gone
along
a
ceiling
now
this
was
insanely
fond
of
gripping
the
with
both
hands
and
so
swinging
and
then
climax
of
delight
he
would
seize
it
with
his
teeth
and
taking
off
his
hands
hold
on
like
grim
death
by
his
huge
ivories
but
all
our
joys
however
elevating
suffer
interruption
little
kate
caught
sampsonet
in
this
posture
and
stood
aghast
she
was
her
daughter
and
her
heart
was
with
the
furniture
not
with
the
gymnast
oh
giles
how
can
you
mother
is
at
hand
it
dents
the
go
and
tell
her
little
snarled
giles
you
are
the
one
for
making
am
i
inquired
kate
calmly
that
is
news
to
the
biggest
in
tergou
growled
giles
fastening
on
again
oh
indeed
said
kate
drily
this
piece
of
unwonted
satire
launched
and
giles
not
visibly
blasted
she
sat
down
quietly
and
cried
her
mother
came
in
almost
at
that
moment
and
giles
hurled
himself
under
the
table
and
there
glared
what
is
to
do
now
said
the
dame
sharply
then
turning
her
experienced
eyes
from
kate
to
giles
and
observing
the
position
he
had
taken
up
and
a
sheepish
expression
she
hinted
at
cuffing
of
ears
nay
mother
said
the
girl
it
was
but
a
foolish
word
giles
spoke
i
had
not
noticed
it
at
another
time
but
i
was
tired
and
in
care
for
gerard
you
let
no
one
be
in
care
for
me
said
a
faint
voice
at
the
door
and
in
tottered
gerard
pale
dusty
and
worn
out
and
amidst
uplifted
hands
and
cries
of
delight
curiosity
and
anxiety
mingled
dropped
exhausted
into
the
nearest
chair
beating
rotterdam
like
a
covert
for
margaret
and
the
long
journey
afterwards
had
fairly
knocked
gerard
up
but
elastic
youth
soon
revived
and
behold
him
the
centre
of
an
eager
circle
first
of
all
they
must
hear
about
the
prizes
then
gerard
told
them
he
had
been
admitted
to
see
the
competitors
works
all
laid
out
in
an
enormous
hall
before
the
judges
pronounced
oh
mother
oh
kate
when
i
saw
the
goldsmiths
work
i
had
liked
to
have
fallen
on
the
floor
i
thought
not
all
the
goldsmiths
on
earth
had
so
much
gold
silver
jewels
and
craft
of
design
and
facture
but
in
sooth
all
the
arts
are
then
to
please
the
females
he
described
to
them
the
reliquaries
feretories
calices
crosiers
crosses
pyxes
monstrances
and
other
wonders
ecclesiastical
and
the
goblets
hanaps
watches
clocks
chains
brooches
so
that
their
mouths
watered
but
kate
when
i
came
to
the
illuminated
work
from
ghent
and
bruges
my
heart
sank
mine
was
dirt
by
the
side
of
it
for
the
first
minute
i
could
almost
have
cried
but
i
prayed
for
a
better
spirit
and
presently
i
was
able
to
enjoy
them
and
thank
god
for
those
lovely
works
and
for
those
skilful
patient
craftsmen
whom
i
own
my
masters
well
the
coloured
work
was
so
beautiful
i
forgot
all
about
the
black
and
white
but
next
day
when
all
the
other
prizes
had
been
given
they
came
to
the
writing
and
whose
name
think
you
was
called
first
yours
said
kate
the
others
laughed
her
to
scorn
you
may
well
laugh
said
gerard
but
for
all
that
gerard
eliassoen
of
tergou
was
the
name
the
herald
shouted
i
stood
stupid
they
thrust
me
forward
everything
swam
before
my
eyes
i
found
myself
kneeling
on
a
cushion
at
the
feet
of
the
duke
he
said
something
to
me
but
i
was
so
fluttered
i
could
not
answer
him
so
then
he
put
his
hand
to
his
side
and
did
not
draw
a
glaive
and
cut
off
my
dull
head
but
gave
me
a
gold
medal
and
there
it
there
was
a
yell
and
almost
a
scramble
and
then
he
gave
me
fifteen
great
bright
golden
angels
i
had
seen
one
before
but
i
never
handled
one
here
they
oh
gerard
oh
gerard
there
is
one
for
you
our
eldest
and
one
for
you
sybrandt
and
for
you
little
mischief
and
two
for
thee
little
lily
because
god
hath
afflicted
thee
and
one
for
myself
to
buy
colours
and
vellum
and
nine
for
her
that
nursed
us
all
and
risked
the
two
crowns
upon
poor
the
gold
drew
out
their
characters
cornelis
and
sybrandt
clutched
each
his
coin
with
one
glare
of
greediness
and
another
glare
of
envy
at
kate
who
had
got
two
pieces
giles
seized
his
and
rolled
it
along
the
floor
and
gambolled
after
it
kate
put
down
her
crutches
and
sat
down
and
held
out
her
little
arms
to
gerard
with
a
heavenly
gesture
of
love
and
tenderness
and
the
mother
fairly
benumbed
at
first
by
the
shower
of
gold
that
fell
on
her
apron
now
cried
out
leave
kissing
him
kate
he
is
my
son
not
yours
ah
gerard
my
boy
i
have
not
loved
you
as
you
then
gerard
threw
himself
on
his
knees
beside
her
and
she
flung
her
arms
round
him
and
wept
for
joy
and
pride
upon
his
neck
good
lad
good
lad
cried
the
hosier
with
some
emotion
i
must
go
and
tell
the
neighbours
lend
me
the
medal
gerard
i
show
it
my
good
friend
peter
buyskens

is
ever
regaling

how
his
son
jorian
won
the
tin
mug

shooting

the
ay

my
man
and
show
peter
buyskens
one
of
the
angels

him

fourteen
more
where
that
came
from
mind
you
bring
it
me
back
stay
a
minute
father
there
is
better
news
behind
said
gerard
flushing
with
joy
at
the
joy
he
caused
better
better
than
this
then
gerard
told
his
interview
with
the
countess
and
the
house
rang
with
joy
now
god
bless
the
good
lady
and
bless
the
dame
van
eyck
a
benefice
our
son
my
cares
are
at
an
end
eli
my
good
friend
and
master
now
we
two
can
die
happy
whenever
our
time
comes
this
dear
boy
will
take
our
place
and
none
of
these
loved
ones
will
want
a
home
or
a
from
that
hour
gerard
was
looked
upon
as
the
stay
of
the
family
he
was
a
son
apart
but
in
another
sense
he
was
always
in
the
right
and
nothing
too
good
for
him
cornelis
and
sybrandt
became
more
and
more
jealous
of
him
and
longed
for
the
day
he
should
go
to
his
benefice
they
would
get
rid
of
the
favourite
and
his
reverence
purse
would
be
open
to
them
with
these
views
he
the
wound
love
had
given
him
throbbed
duller
and
duller
his
success
and
the
affection
and
admiration
of
his
parents
made
him
think
more
highly
of
himself
and
resent
with
more
spirit
margaret
ingratitude
and
discourtesy
for
all
that
she
had
power
to
cool
him
towards
the
rest
of
her
sex
and
now
for
every
reason
he
wished
to
be
ordained
priest
as
soon
as
he
could
pass
the
intermediate
orders
he
knew
the
vulgate
already
better
than
most
of
the
clergy
and
studied
the
rubric
and
the
dogmas
of
the
church
with
his
friends
the
monks
and
the
first
time
the
bishop
came
that
way
he
applied
to
be
admitted
exorcist
the
third
step
in
holy
orders
the
bishop
questioned
him
and
ordained
him
at
once
he
had
to
kneel
and
after
a
short
prayer
the
bishop
delivered
to
him
a
little
full
of
exorcisms
and
said
take
this
gerard
and
have
power
to
lay
hands
on
the
possessed
whether
baptized
or
catechumens
and
he
took
it
reverently
and
went
home
invested
by
the
church
with
power
to
cast
out
demons
returning
home
from
the
church
he
was
met
by
little
kate
on
her
crutches
oh
gerard
who
think
you
hath
sent
to
our
house
seeking
you
the
burgomaster
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
what
would
he
with
me
nay
gerard
i
know
not
but
he
seems
urgent
to
see
you
you
are
to
go
to
his
house
on
the
well
he
is
the
burgomaster
i
will
go
but
it
likes
me
not
kate
i
have
seen
him
cast
such
a
look
on
me
as
no
friend
casts
no
matter
such
looks
forewarn
the
wise
to
be
sure
he
knows
what
gerard
nothing
kate
i
chapter
v
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
was
an
artful
man
he
opened
on
the
novice
with
something
quite
wide
of
the
mark
he
was
really
aiming
at
the
town
records
said
he
are
crabbedly
written
and
the
ink
rusty
with
he
offered
gerard
the
honour
of
transcribing
them
fair
gerard
inquired
what
he
was
to
be
paid
ghysbrecht
offered
a
sum
that
would
have
just
purchased
the
pens
ink
and
parchment
but
burgomaster
my
labour
here
is
a
year
your
labour
call
you
marking
parchment
labour
little
sweat
goes
to
that
i
is
labour
and
skilled
labour
to
boot
and
that
is
better
paid
in
all
crafts
than
rude
labour
sweat
or
no
sweat
besides
there
my
your
time
why
what
is
time
to
you
at
then
fixing
his
eyes
keenly
on
gerard
to
mark
the
effect
of
his
words
he
said
say
rather
you
are
idle
grown
you
are
in
love
your
body
is
with
these
chanting
monks
but
your
heart
is
with
peter
brandt
and
his
i
know
no
peter
this
denial
confirmed
ghysbrecht
suspicion
that
the
of
demons
was
playing
a
deep
game
ye
lie
he
shouted
did
i
not
find
you
at
her
elbow
on
the
road
to
rotterdam
ah
ah
and
you
were
seen
at
sevenbergen
but
was
i
ah
and
at
peter
at
sevenbergen
ay
at
now
this
was
what
in
modern
days
is
called
a
draw
it
was
a
guess
put
boldly
forth
as
fact
to
elicit
by
the
young
man
answer
whether
he
had
been
there
lately
or
not
the
result
of
the
artifice
surprised
the
crafty
one
gerard
started
up
in
a
strange
state
of
nervous
excitement
burgomaster
said
he
with
trembling
voice
i
have
not
been
at
sevenbergen
these
three
years
and
i
know
not
the
name
of
those
you
saw
me
with
nor
where
they
dwelt
but
as
my
time
is
precious
though
you
value
it
not
give
you
good
and
he
darted
out
with
his
eyes
sparkling
ghysbrecht
started
up
in
huge
ire
but
he
sank
into
his
chair
again
he
fears
me
not
he
knows
something
if
not
then
he
called
hastily
to
his
trusty
servant
and
almost
dragged
him
to
a
window
see
you
yon
man
he
cried
haste
follow
him
but
let
him
not
see
you
he
is
young
but
old
in
craft
keep
him
in
sight
all
day
let
me
know
whither
he
goes
and
what
he
it
was
night
when
the
servant
returned
well
well
cried
van
swieten
eagerly
master
the
young
man
went
from
you
to
ghysbrecht
groaned
to
the
house
of
peter
the
chapter
vi
look
into
your
own
heart
and
write
said
herr
cant
and
cuckoos
echoed
the
cry
look
into
the

where
it
is
deepest
and
the
thames
where
it

and
paint
the
bottom
lower
a
bucket
into
a
well
of
and
what
comes
up
must
be
immortal
truth
must
it
now
in
the
first
place
no
son
of
adam
ever
reads
his
own
heart
at
all
except
by
the
habit
acquired
and
the
light
gained
from
some
years
perusal
of
other
hearts
and
even
then
with
his
acquired
sagacity
and
reflected
light
he
can
but
spell
and
decipher
his
own
heart
not
read
it
fluently
half
way
to
sevenbergen
gerard
looked
into
his
own
heart
and
asked
it
why
he
was
going
to
sevenbergen
his
heart
replied
without
a
moment
hesitation
we
are
going
out
of
curiosity
to
know
why
she
jilted
us
and
to
show
her
it
has
not
broken
our
hearts
and
that
we
are
quite
content
with
our
honours
and
our
benefice
in
prospectu
and
do
want
her
nor
ally
of
her
fickle
he
soon
found
out
peter
brandt
cottage
and
there
sat
a
girl
in
the
doorway
plying
her
needle
and
a
stalwart
figure
leaned
on
a
long
bow
and
talked
to
her
gerard
felt
an
unaccountable
pang
at
the
sight
of
him
however
the
man
turned
out
to
be
past
fifty
years
of
age
an
old
soldier
whom
gerard
remembered
to
have
seen
shoot
at
the
butts
with
admirable
force
and
skill
another
minute
and
the
youth
stood
before
them
margaret
looked
up
and
dropped
her
work
and
uttered
a
faint
cry
and
was
white
and
red
by
turns
but
these
signs
of
emotion
were
swiftly
dismissed
and
she
turned
far
more
chill
and
indifferent
than
she
would
if
she
had
not
betrayed
this
agitation
what
is
it
you
master
gerard
what
on
earth
brings
you
here
i
wonder
i
was
passing
by
and
saw
you
so
i
thought
i
would
give
you
good
day
and
ask
after
your
my
father
is
well
he
will
be
here
then
i
may
as
well
stay
till
he
as
you
will
good
martin
step
into
the
village
and
tell
my
father
here
is
a
friend
of
and
not
of
yours
my
father
friends
are
that
is
doubtful
it
was
not
like
a
friend
to
promise
to
wait
for
me
and
then
make
off
the
moment
my
back
was
turned
cruel
margaret
you
little
know
how
i
searched
the
town
for
you
how
for
want
of
you
nothing
was
pleasant
to
these
are
idle
words
if
you
had
desired
my
father
company
or
mine
you
would
have
come
back
there
i
had
a
bed
laid
for
you
sir
at
my
cousin
and
he
would
have
made
much
of
you
and
who
knows
i
might
have
made
much
of
you
too
i
was
in
the
humour
that
day
you
will
not
catch
me
in
the
same
mind
again
neither
you
nor
any
young
man
i
warrant
margaret
i
came
back
the
moment
the
countess
let
me
go
but
you
were
not
nay
you
did
not
or
you
had
seen
hans
cloterman
at
our
table
we
left
him
to
bring
you
i
saw
no
one
there
but
only
a
drunken
man
that
had
just
tumbled
at
our
table
how
was
he
clad
nay
i
took
little
heed
in
at
this
margaret
face
gradually
warmed
but
presently
assuming
incredulity
and
severity
she
put
many
shrewd
questions
all
of
which
gerard
answered
most
loyally
finally
the
clouds
cleared
and
they
guessed
how
the
misunderstanding
had
come
about
then
came
a
revulsion
of
tenderness
all
the
more
powerful
that
they
had
done
each
other
wrong
and
then
more
dangerous
still
came
mutual
confessions
neither
had
been
happy
since
neither
ever
would
have
been
happy
but
for
this
fortunate
meeting
and
gerard
found
a
vulgate
lying
open
on
the
table
and
pounced
upon
it
like
a
hawk
mss
were
his
delight
but
before
he
could
get
to
it
two
white
hands
quickly
came
flat
upon
the
page
and
a
red
face
over
them
nay
take
away
your
hands
margaret
that
i
may
see
where
you
are
reading
and
i
will
read
there
too
at
home
so
shall
my
soul
meet
yours
in
the
sacred
page
you
will
not
nay
then
i
must
kiss
them
and
he
kissed
them
so
often
that
for
very
shame
they
were
fain
to
withdraw
and
lo
the
sacred
book
lay
open
at
an
apple
of
gold
in
a
network
of
there
now
said
she
i
had
been
hunting
for
it
ever
so
long
and
found
it
but
even
now
and
to
be
caught
and
with
a
touch
of
inconsistency
she
pointed
it
out
to
gerard
with
her
white
finger
ay
said
he
but
it
is
all
hidden
in
that
great
it
is
a
comely
cap
i
told
by
maybe
but
what
it
hides
is
it
is
not
it
is
well
it
was
beautiful
at
ay
everything
was
beautiful
that
day
with
a
little
sigh
and
now
peter
came
in
and
welcomed
gerard
cordially
and
would
have
him
to
stay
supper
and
margaret
disappeared
and
gerard
had
a
nice
learned
chat
with
peter
and
margaret
reappeared
with
her
hair
in
her
silver
net
and
shot
a
glance
half
arch
half
coy
and
glided
about
them
and
spread
supper
and
beamed
bright
with
gaiety
and
happiness
and
in
the
cool
evening
gerard
coaxed
her
out
and
she
objected
and
came
and
coaxed
her
on
to
the
road
to
tergou
and
she
declined
and
came
and
there
they
strolled
up
and
down
hand
in
hand
and
when
he
must
go
they
pledged
each
other
never
to
quarrel
or
misunderstand
one
another
again
and
they
sealed
the
promise
with
a
long
loving
kiss
and
gerard
went
home
on
wings
from
that
day
gerard
spent
most
of
his
evenings
with
margaret
and
the
attachment
deepened
and
deepened
on
both
sides
till
the
hours
they
spent
together
were
the
hours
they
lived
the
rest
they
counted
and
underwent
and
at
the
outset
of
this
deep
attachment
all
went
smoothly
obstacles
there
were
but
they
seemed
distant
and
small
to
the
eyes
of
hope
youth
and
love
the
feelings
and
passions
of
so
many
persons
that
this
attachment
would
thwart
gave
no
warning
smoke
to
show
their
volcanic
nature
and
power
the
course
of
true
love
ran
smoothly
placidly
until
it
had
drawn
these
two
young
hearts
into
its
current
for
ever
and
then
chapter
vii
one
bright
morning
unwonted
velvet
shone
unwonted
feathers
waved
and
horses
hoofs
glinted
and
ran
through
the
streets
of
tergou
and
the
windows
and
balconies
were
studded
with
wondering
faces
the
french
ambassador
was
riding
through
to
sport
in
the
neighbouring
forest
besides
his
own
suite
he
was
attended
by
several
servants
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
lent
to
do
him
honour
and
minister
to
his
pleasure
the
duke
tumbler
rode
before
him
with
a
grave
sedate
majesty
that
made
his
more
noble
companions
seem
light
frivolous
persons
but
ever
and
anon
when
respect
and
awe
neared
the
oppressive
he
rolled
off
his
horse
so
ignobly
and
funnily
that
even
the
ambassador
was
fain
to
burst
out
laughing
he
also
climbed
up
again
by
the
tail
in
a
way
provocative
of
mirth
and
so
he
played
his
part
towards
the
rear
of
the
pageant
rode
one
that
excited
more
attention
still
the
duke
leopard
a
huntsman
mounted
on
a
flemish
horse
of
giant
prodigious
size
and
power
carried
a
long
box
fastened
to
the
rider
loins
by
straps
curiously
contrived
and
on
this
box
sat
a
bright
leopard
crouching
she
was
chained
to
the
huntsman
the
people
admired
her
glossy
hide
and
spots
and
pressed
near
and
one
or
two
were
for
feeling
her
and
pulling
her
tail
then
the
huntsman
shouted
in
a
terrible
voice
beware
at
antwerp
one
did
but
throw
a
handful
of
dust
at
her
and
the
duke
made
dust
of
gramercy
i
speak
sooth
the
good
duke
shut
him
up
in
prison
in
a
cell
under
ground
and
the
rats
cleaned
the
flesh
off
his
bones
in
a
night
served
him
right
for
molesting
the
poor
there
was
a
murmur
of
fear
and
the
tergovians
shrank
from
tickling
the
leopard
of
their
sovereign
but
an
incident
followed
that
raised
their
spirits
again
the
giant
a
hungarian
seven
feet
four
inches
high
brought
up
the
rear
this
enormous
creature
had
like
some
other
giants
a
treble
fluty
voice
of
little
power
he
was
a
vain
fellow
and
not
conscious
of
this
nor
any
defect
now
it
happened
he
caught
sight
of
giles
sitting
on
the
top
of
the
balcony
so
he
stopped
and
began
to
make
fun
of
him
hallo
brother
squeaked
he
i
had
nearly
passed
without
seeing
you
are
plain
enough
to
see
bellowed
giles
in
his
bass
tones
come
on
my
shoulder
brother
squeaked
titan
and
held
out
a
shoulder
of
mutton
fist
to
help
him
down
if
i
do
i
cuff
your
ears
roared
the
dwarf
the
giant
saw
the
homuncule
was
irascible
and
played
upon
him
being
encouraged
thereto
by
the
shouts
of
laughter
for
he
did
not
see
that
the
people
were
laughing
not
at
his
wit
but
at
the
ridiculous
incongruity
of
the
two
voices
the
gigantic
feeble
fife
and
the
petty
deep
loud
drum
the
mountain
delivered
of
a
squeak
and
the
belching
thunder
the
singular
duet
came
to
as
singular
an
end
giles
lost
all
patience
and
and
being
a
creature
devoid
of
fear
and
in
a
rage
to
boot
he
actually
dropped
upon
the
giant
neck
seized
his
hair
with
one
hand
and
punched
his
head
with
the
other
the
giant
first
impulse
was
to
laugh
but
the
weight
and
rapidity
of
the
blows
soon
corrected
that
inclination
he
he
ah
ha
hallo
oh
oh
holy
saints
here
help
or
i
must
throttle
the
imp
i
ca
i
split
your
skull
against
the
and
he
made
a
wild
run
backwards
at
the
balcony
giles
saw
his
danger
seized
the
balcony
in
time
with
both
hands
and
whipped
over
it
just
as
the
giant
head
came
against
it
with
a
stunning
crack
the
people
roared
with
laughter
and
exultation
at
the
address
of
their
little
champion
the
indignant
giant
seized
two
of
the
laughers
knocked
them
together
like
shook
them
and
strewed
them
flat
catherine
shrieked
and
threw
her
apron
over
giles
then
strode
wrathfully
away
after
the
party
this
incident
had
consequences
no
one
then
present
foresaw
its
immediate
results
were
agreeable
the
tergovians
turned
proud
of
giles
and
listened
with
more
affability
to
his
prayers
for
parchment
for
he
drove
a
regular
trade
with
his
brother
gerard
in
this
article
went
about
and
begged
it
gratis
and
gerard
gave
him
coppers
for
it
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
catherine
and
her
daughter
were
chatting
together
about
their
favourite
theme
gerard
his
goodness
his
benefice
and
the
brightened
prospects
of
the
whole
family
their
good
luck
had
come
to
them
in
the
very
shape
they
would
have
chosen
besides
the
advantages
of
a
benefice
such
as
the
countess
charolois
would
not
disdain
to
give
there
was
the
feminine
delight
at
having
a
priest
a
holy
man
in
their
own
family
he
will
marry
cornelis
and
sybrandt
for
they
can
wed
good
housewives
now
if
they
will
gerard
will
take
care
of
you
and
giles
when
we
are
yes
mother
and
we
can
confess
to
him
instead
of
to
a
stranger
said
kate
ay
girl
and
he
can
give
the
sacred
oil
to
your
father
and
me
and
close
our
eyes
when
our
time
oh
mother
not
for
many
many
years
i
do
pray
heaven
pray
speak
not
of
that
it
always
makes
me
sad
i
hope
to
go
before
you
mother
dear
no
let
us
be
gay
i
am
out
of
pain
mother
quite
out
of
all
pain
it
does
seem
so
strange
and
i
feel
so
bright
and
happy
that
mother
can
you
keep
a
secret
nobody
better
child
why
you
know
i
then
i
will
show
you
something
so
beautiful
you
never
saw
the
like
i
trow
only
gerard
must
never
know
for
sure
he
means
to
surprise
us
with
it
he
covers
it
up
so
and
sometimes
he
carries
it
away
kate
took
her
crutches
and
moved
slowly
away
leaving
her
mother
in
an
exalted
state
of
curiosity
she
soon
returned
with
something
in
a
cloth
uncovered
it
and
there
was
a
lovely
picture
of
the
virgin
with
all
her
insignia
and
wearing
her
tiara
over
a
wealth
of
beautiful
hair
which
flowed
loose
over
her
shoulders
catherine
at
first
was
struck
with
awe
it
is
herself
she
cried
it
is
the
queen
of
heaven
i
never
saw
one
like
her
to
my
mind
and
her
eyes
mother
lifted
to
the
sky
as
if
they
belonged
there
and
not
to
a
mortal
creature
and
her
beautiful
hair
of
burning
and
to
think
i
have
a
son
that
can
make
the
saints
live
again
upon
a
piece
of
wood
the
reason
is
he
is
a
young
saint
himself
mother
he
is
too
good
for
this
world
he
is
here
to
portray
the
blessed
and
then
to
go
away
and
be
with
them
for
ere
they
had
half
done
admiring
it
a
strange
voice
was
heard
at
the
door
by
one
of
the
furtive
instincts
of
their
sex
they
hastily
hid
the
picture
in
the
cloth
though
there
was
no
need
and
the
next
moment
in
came
casting
his
eyes
furtively
around
a
man
that
had
not
entered
the
house
this
ten
years
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
the
two
women
were
so
taken
by
surprise
that
they
merely
stared
at
him
and
at
one
another
and
said
the
burgomaster
in
a
tone
so
expressive
that
ghysbrecht
felt
compelled
to
answer
it
yes
i
own
the
last
time
i
came
here
was
not
on
a
friendly
errand
men
love
their
own
interest
eli
and
mine
were
contrary
well
let
this
visit
atone
the
last
i
come
on
your
business
and
none
of
catherine
and
her
daughter
exchanged
a
swift
glance
of
contemptuous
incredulity
they
knew
the
man
better
than
he
thought
it
is
about
your
son
ay
ay
you
want
him
to
work
for
the
town
all
for
nothing
he
told
i
come
on
no
such
errand
it
is
to
let
you
know
he
has
fallen
into
bad
now
heaven
and
the
saints
forbid
man
torture
not
a
mother
speak
out
and
quickly
speak
ere
you
have
time
to
coin
falsehood
we
know
ghysbrecht
turned
pale
at
this
affront
and
spite
mingled
with
the
other
motives
that
brought
him
here
thus
it
is
then
said
he
grinding
his
teeth
and
speaking
very
fast
your
son
gerard
is
more
like
to
be
father
of
a
family
than
a
priest
he
is
for
ever
with
margaret
peter
girl
and
loves
her
like
a
cow
her
mother
and
daughter
both
burst
out
laughing
ghysbrecht
stared
at
them
what
you
knew
it
carry
this
tale
to
those
who
know
not
my
son
gerard
women
are
nought
to
other
women
mayhap
but
this
one
is
the
apple
of
his
eye
to
him
or
will
be
if
you
part
them
not
and
soon
come
dame
make
me
not
waste
time
and
friendly
counsel
my
servant
has
seen
them
together
a
score
times
handed
and
reading
babies
in
one
another
eyes
like
you
know
dame
you
have
been
young
girl
i
am
ill
at
ease
yea
i
have
been
young
and
know
how
blind
and
foolish
the
young
are
my
heart
he
has
turned
me
sick
in
a
moment
kate
if
it
should
be
true
nay
nay
cried
kate
eagerly
gerard
might
love
a
young
woman
all
young
men
do
i
ca
find
what
they
see
in
them
to
love
so
but
if
he
did
he
would
let
us
know
he
would
not
deceive
us
you
wicked
man
no
dear
mother
look
not
so
gerard
is
too
good
to
love
a
creature
of
earth
his
love
is
for
our
lady
and
the
saints
ah
i
will
show
you
the
picture
there
if
his
heart
was
earthly
could
he
paint
the
queen
of
heaven
like
that
look
look
and
she
held
the
picture
out
triumphantly
and
more
radiant
and
beautiful
in
this
moment
of
enthusiasm
than
ever
dead
picture
was
or
will
be
the
burgomaster
with
her
eloquence
and
her
feminine
proof
of
purity
his
eyes
and
mouth
opened
and
remained
open
in
which
state
they
kept
turning
face
and
all
as
if
on
a
pivot
from
the
picture
to
the
women
and
from
the
women
to
the
picture
why
it
is
herself
he
gasped
is
it
cried
kate
and
her
hostility
was
softened
you
admire
it
i
forgive
you
for
frightening
am
i
in
a
said
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
thoroughly
puzzled
you
show
me
a
picture
of
the
girl
and
you
say
he
painted
it
and
that
is
a
proof
he
can
not
love
her
why
they
all
paint
their
sweethearts
painters
a
picture
of
the
girl
exclaimed
kate
shocked
fie
this
is
no
girl
this
is
our
blessed
no

is
margaret
oh
blind
it
is
the
queen
of
no

of
sevenbergen
profane
man
behold

crown
silly
child

at
her
red
hair

the
virgin
be
seen
in
red
hair
she
who
had
the
pick
of
all
the
colours
ten
thousand
years
before
the
world
at
this
moment
an
anxious
face
was
insinuated
round
the
edge
of
the
open
door
it
was
their
neighbour
peter
buyskens
what
is
to
do
said
he
in
a
cautious
whisper
we
can
hear
you
all
across
the
street
what
on
earth
is
to
do
oh
neighbour
what
is
to
do
why
here
is
the
burgomaster
blackening
our
stop
cried
van
swieten
peter
buyskens
is
come
in
the
nick
of
time
he
knows
father
and
daughter
both
they
cast
their
glamour
on
what
is
she
a
witch
too
else
the
egg
takes
not
after
the
bird
why
is
her
father
called
the
magician
i
tell
you
they
bewitched
this
very
peter
here
they
cast
unholy
spells
on
him
and
cured
him
of
the
colic
now
peter
look
and
tell
me
who
is
that
and
you
be
silent
women
for
a
moment
if
you
can
who
is
it
peter
well
to
be
sure
said
peter
in
reply
and
his
eye
seemed
fascinated
by
the
picture
who
is
it
repeated
ghysbrecht
impetuously
peter
buyskens
smiled
why
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
but
what
have
they
put
a
crown
on
her
for
i
never
saw
her
in
a
crown
for
my
man
alive
ca
you
open
your
great
jaws
and
just
speak
a
name
plain
out
to
oblige
three
people
i
do
a
great
deal
more
to
oblige
one
of
you
than
that
burgomaster
if
it
is
as
natural
as
life
curse
the
man
he
wo
he
wo
curse
him
why
what
have
i
done
now

little
kate

pity
sake

these
the
features
of
a
living
woman
of
of
margaret
brandt
a
mirror

not
truer
my
little
but
is
it
she
sir
for
very
certain
why
who
else
should
it
be
now
why
could
you
say
so
at
once
snarled
ghysbrecht
i
did
say
so
as
plain
as
i
could
speak
snapped
peter
and
they
growled
over
this
small
bone
of
contention
so
zealously
that
they
did
not
see
catherine
and
her
daughter
had
thrown
their
aprons
over
their
heads
and
were
rocking
to
and
fro
in
deep
distress
the
next
moment
elias
came
in
from
the
shop
and
stood
aghast
catherine
though
her
face
was
covered
knew
his
footstep
that
is
my
poor
man
she
sobbed
tell
him
good
peter
buyskens
for
i
have
not
the
elias
turned
pale
the
presence
of
the
burgomaster
in
his
house
after
so
many
years
of
coolness
coupled
with
his
wife
and
distress
made
him
fear
some
heavy
misfortune
richart
jacob
he
gasped
no
no
said
the
burgomaster
it
is
nearer
home
and
nobody
is
dead
or
dying
old
god
bless
you
burgomaster
ah
something
has
gone
off
my
breast
that
was
like
to
choke
me
now
what
is
the
matter
ghysbrecht
then
told
him
all
that
he
told
the
women
and
showed
the
picture
in
evidence
is
that
all
said
eli
profoundly
relieved
what
are
ye
roaring
and
bellowing
for
it
is
vexing
it
is
angering
but
it
is
not
like
death
not
even
sickness
boys
will
be
boys
he
will
outgrow
that
disease
is
but
but
when
ghysbrecht
told
him
that
margaret
was
a
girl
of
good
character
that
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
she
would
be
so
intimate
if
marriage
had
not
been
spoken
of
between
them
his
brow
darkened
marriage
that
shall
never
be
said
he
sternly
i
stay
that
ay
by
force
if
need
be
as
i
would
his
hand
lifted
to
cut
his
throat
do
what
old
john
koestein
did
and
what
is
that
in
heaven
name
asked
the
mother
suddenly
removing
her
apron
it
was
the
burgomaster
who
replied
he
made
me
shut
young
albert
koestein
up
in
the
prison
of
the
stadthouse
till
he
knocked
under
it
was
not
long
hours
all
alone
on
bread
and
water
cooled
his
hot
stomach
my
father
i
am
his
humble
servant
says
he
let
me
into
the
sun
once
more
the
sun
is
worth
all
the
wenches
in
the
world
oh
the
cruelty
of
men
sighed
catherine
as
to
that
the
burgomaster
has
no
choice
it
is
the
law
and
if
a
father
says
lock
up
my
son
he
must
do
it
a
fine
thing
it
would
be
if
a
father
might
not
lock
up
his
own
well
well
it
wo
come
to
that
with
me
and
my
son
he
never
disobeyed
me
in
his
life
he
never
shall
where
is
he
it
is
past
where
is
he
kate
alas
i
know
not
i
know
said
ghysbrecht
he
is
at
sevenbergen
my
servant
met
him
on
the
supper
passed
in
gloomy
silence
evening
descended
no
gerard
eight
came
no
gerard
then
the
father
sent
all
to
bed
except
catherine
you
and
i
will
walk
abroad
wife
and
talk
over
this
new
abroad
my
man
at
this
time
whither

on
the
road
to
oh
no
no
hasty
words
father
poor
gerard
he
never
vexed
you
fear
me
not
but
it
must
end
and
i
am
not
one
that
trusts
with
the
old
pair
walked
hand
in
hand
for
strange
is
it
may
appear
to
some
of
my
readers
the
use
of
the
elbow
to
couples
walking
was
not
discovered
in
europe
till
centuries
after
this
they
sauntered
on
a
long
time
in
silence
the
night
was
clear
and
balmy
such
nights
calm
and
silent
recall
the
past
from
the
dead
it
is
a
many
years
since
we
walked
so
late
my
man
said
catherine
softly

do

as

strong
and
the
same
in
all
our

kate
i

been
happy

but
none

a
heart

a
great
comfort
to
man
or
woman

it
eli
it

so
my
lass
doth
joy
double
and
halveth
trouble
runs
the
byword
and
so
i
have
found
it
sweetheart
ah
here
comes
the
young
catherine
trembled
and
held
her
husband
hand
tight
the
moon
was
bright
but
they
were
in
the
shadow
of
some
trees
and
their
son
did
not
see
them
he
came
singing
in
the
moonlight
and
his
face
shining
chapter
viii
while
the
burgomaster
was
exposing
gerard
at
tergou
margaret
had
a
trouble
of
her
own
at
sevenbergen
it
was
a
housewife
distress
but
deeper
than
we
can
well
conceive
she
came
to
martin
wittenhaagen
the
old
soldier
with
tears
in
her
eyes
martin
there
nothing
in
the
house
and
gerard
is
coming
and
he
is
so
thoughtless
he
forgets
to
sup
at
home
when
he
gives
over
work
then
he
runs
to
me
straight
poor
soul
and
often
he
comes
quite
faint
and
to
think
i
have
nothing
to
set
before
my
servant
that
loves
me
so
martin
scratched
his
head
what
can
i
do
it
is
thursday
it
is
your
day
to
shoot
sooth
to
say
i
counted
on
you
nay
said
the
soldier
i
may
not
shoot
when
the
duke
or
his
friends
are
at
the
chase
read
else
i
am
no
and
he
took
out
of
his
pouch
a
parchment
with
a
grand
seal
it
purported
to
be
a
stipend
and
a
licence
given
by
philip
duke
of
burgundy
to
martin
wittenhaagen
one
of
his
archers
in
return
for
services
in
the
wars
and
for
a
wound
received
at
the
dukes
side
the
stipend
was
four
merks
yearly
to
be
paid
by
the
duke
almoner
and
the
licence
was
to
shoot
three
arrows
once
a
week
on
thursday
and
no
other
day
in
any
of
the
forests
in
holland
at
any
game
but
a
buck
or
a
doe
carrying
fawn
proviso
that
the
duke
should
not
be
hunting
on
that
day
or
any
of
his
friends
in
this
case
martin
was
not
to
go
and
disturb
the
woods
on
peril
of
his
salary
and
his
head
and
a
fine
of
a
penny
margaret
sighed
and
was
silent
come
cheer
up
mistress
said
he
for
your
sake
i
peril
my
carcass
i
have
done
that
for
many
a
one
that
was
not
worth
your
forefinger
it
is
no
such
mighty
risk
either
i
but
step
into
the
skirts
of
the
forest
here
it
is
odds
but
they
drive
a
hare
or
a
fawn
within
reach
of
my
well
if
i
let
you
go
you
must
promise
me
not
to
go
far
and
not
to
be
seen
far
better
gerard
went
supperless
than
ill
should
come
to
you
faithful
the
required
promise
given
martin
took
his
bow
and
three
arrows
and
stole
cautiously
into
the
wood
it
was
scarce
a
furlong
distant
the
horns
were
heard
faintly
in
the
distance
and
all
the
game
was
afoot
come
thought
martin
i
shall
soon
fill
the
pot
and
no
one
be
the
he
took
his
stand
behind
a
thick
oak
that
commanded
a
view
of
an
open
glade
and
strung
his
bow
a
truly
formidable
weapon
it
was
of
english
yew
six
feet
two
inches
high
and
thick
in
proportion
and
martin
with
arms
all
iron
and
cord
and
used
to
the
bow
from
infancy
could
draw
a
arrow
to
the
head
and
when
it
flew
the
eye
could
scarce
follow
it
and
the
bowstring
twanged
as
musical
as
a
harp
this
bow
had
laid
many
a
stout
soldier
low
in
the
wars
of
the
hoecks
and
in
those
days
a
battlefield
was
not
a
cloud
of
smoke
the
combatants
were
few
but
the
deaths
many
for
they
saw
what
they
were
about
and
fewer
bloodless
arrows
flew
than
bloodless
bullets
now
a
hare
came
cantering
then
sat
sprightly
and
her
ears
made
a
capital
martin
levelled
his
tremendous
weapon
at
her
the
arrow
flew
the
string
twanged
but
martin
had
been
in
a
hurry
to
pot
her
and
lost
her
by
an
inch
the
arrow
seemed
to
hit
her
but
it
struck
the
ground
close
to
her
and
passed
under
her
belly
like
a
flash
and
hissed
along
the
short
grass
and
disappeared
she
jumped
three
feet
perpendicular
and
away
at
the
top
of
her
speed
bungler
said
martin
a
sure
proof
he
was
not
an
habitual
bungler
or
he
would
have
blamed
the
hare
he
had
scarcely
fitted
another
arrow
to
his
string
when
a
settled
on
the
very
tree
he
stood
under
aha
thought
he
you
are
small
but
this
time
he
took
more
pains
drew
his
arrow
carefully
loosed
it
smoothly
and
saw
it
to
all
appearance
go
clean
through
the
bird
carrying
feathers
skyward
like
dust
instead
of
falling
at
his
feet
the
bird
whose
breast
was
torn
not
fairly
pierced
fluttered
feebly
away
and
by
a
great
effort
rose
above
the
trees
flew
some
fifty
yards
and
dead
at
last
but
where
he
could
not
see
for
the
thick
foliage
luck
is
against
me
said
he
despondingly
but
he
fitted
another
arrow
and
eyed
the
glade
keenly
presently
he
heard
a
bustle
behind
him
and
turned
round
just
in
time
to
see
a
noble
buck
cross
the
open
but
too
late
to
shoot
at
him
he
dashed
his
bow
down
with
an
imprecation
at
that
moment
a
long
spotted
animal
glided
swiftly
across
after
the
deer
its
belly
seemed
to
touch
the
ground
as
it
went
martin
took
up
his
bow
hastily
he
recognized
the
duke
leopard
the
hunters
will
not
be
far
from
her
said
he
and
i
must
not
be
seen
gerard
must
go
supperless
this
he
plunged
into
the
wood
following
the
buck
and
leopard
for
that
was
his
way
home
he
had
not
gone
far
when
he
heard
an
unusual
sound
ahead
of
him
leaves
rustling
violently
and
the
ground
trampled
he
hurried
in
the
direction
he
found
the
leopard
on
the
buck
back
tearing
him
with
teeth
and
claw
and
the
buck
running
in
a
circle
and
bounding
convulsively
with
the
blood
pouring
down
his
hide
then
martin
formed
a
desperate
resolution
to
have
the
venison
for
margaret
he
drew
his
arrow
to
the
head
and
buried
it
in
the
deer
who
spite
of
the
creature
on
his
back
bounded
high
into
the
air
and
fell
dead
the
leopard
went
on
tearing
him
as
if
nothing
had
happened
martin
hoped
that
the
creature
would
gorge
itself
with
blood
and
then
let
him
take
the
meat
he
waited
some
minutes
then
walked
resolutely
up
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
buck
leg
the
leopard
gave
a
frightful
growl
and
left
off
sucking
blood
she
saw
martin
game
and
was
sulky
and
on
her
guard
what
was
to
be
done
martin
had
heard
that
wild
creatures
can
not
stand
the
human
eye
accordingly
he
stood
erect
and
fixed
his
on
the
leopard
the
leopard
returned
a
savage
glance
and
never
took
her
eye
off
martin
then
martin
continuing
to
look
the
beast
down
the
leopard
brutally
ignorant
of
natural
history
flew
at
his
head
with
a
frightful
yell
flaming
eyes
and
jaws
and
distended
he
had
but
just
time
to
catch
her
by
the
throat
before
her
teeth
could
crush
his
face
one
of
her
claws
seized
his
shoulder
and
rent
it
the
other
aimed
at
his
cheek
would
have
been
more
deadly
still
but
martin
was
and
wore
no
hat
but
a
scapulary
of
the
same
stuff
as
his
jerkin
and
this
scapulary
he
had
brought
over
his
head
like
a
hood
the
brute
claw
caught
in
the
loose
leather
martin
kept
her
teeth
off
his
face
with
great
difficulty
and
griped
her
throat
fiercely
and
she
kept
rending
his
shoulder
it
was
like
blunt
grinding
and
tearing
the
pain
was
fearful
but
instead
of
cowing
the
old
soldier
it
put
his
blood
up
and
he
gnashed
his
teeth
with
rage
almost
as
fierce
as
hers
and
squeezed
her
neck
with
iron
force
the
two
pair
of
eyes
flared
at
one
another
and
now
the
man
were
almost
as
furious
as
the
brute
she
found
he
was
throttling
her
and
made
a
wild
attempt
to
free
herself
in
which
she
dragged
his
cowl
all
over
his
face
and
blinded
him
and
tore
her
claw
out
of
his
shoulder
flesh
and
all
but
still
he
throttled
her
with
hand
and
arm
of
iron
presently
her
long
tail
that
was
high
in
the
air
went
down
aha
cried
martin
joyfully
and
gripped
her
like
death
next
her
body
lost
its
elasticity
and
he
held
a
choked
and
powerless
thing
he
gripped
it
still
till
all
motion
ceased
then
dashed
it
to
the
earth
then
panting
removed
his
cowl
the
leopard
lay
mute
at
his
feet
with
tongue
protruding
and
bloody
paw
and
for
the
first
time
terror
fell
on
martin
i
am
a
dead
man
i
have
slain
the
duke
he
hastily
seized
a
few
handfuls
of
leaves
and
threw
them
over
her
then
shouldered
the
buck
and
staggered
away
leaving
a
trail
of
blood
all
the
way
his
own
and
the
buck
he
burst
into
peter
house
a
horrible
figure
bleeding
and
bloodstained
and
flung
the
deer
carcass
down
there
no
questions
said
he
but
broil
me
a
steak
o
for
i
am
margaret
did
not
see
he
was
wounded
she
thought
the
blood
was
all
from
the
deer
she
busied
herself
at
the
fire
and
the
stout
soldier
stanched
and
bound
his
own
wound
apart
and
soon
he
and
gerard
and
margaret
were
supping
royally
on
broiled
venison
they
were
very
merry
and
gerard
with
wonderful
thoughtfulness
had
brought
a
flask
of
schiedam
and
under
its
influence
martin
revived
and
told
them
how
the
venison
was
got
and
they
all
made
merry
over
the
exploit
their
mirth
was
strangely
interrupted
margaret
eye
became
fixed
and
fascinated
and
her
cheek
pale
with
fear
she
gasped
and
could
not
speak
but
pointed
to
the
window
with
trembling
finger
their
eyes
followed
hers
and
there
in
the
twilight
crouched
a
dark
form
with
eyes
like
glowworms
it
was
the
leopard
while
they
stood
petrified
fascinated
by
the
eyes
of
green
fire
there
sounded
in
the
wood
a
single
deep
bay
martin
trembled
at
it
they
have
lost
her
and
laid
muzzled
bloodhounds
on
her
scent
they
will
find
her
here
and
the
venison
friends
martin
wittenhaagen
ends
gerard
seized
his
bow
and
put
it
into
the
soldier
hands
be
a
man
he
cried
shoot
her
and
fling
her
into
the
wood
ere
they
come
up
who
will
know
more
voices
of
hounds
broke
out
and
nearer
curse
her
cried
martin
i
spared
her
once
now
she
must
die
or
i
or
both
more
likely
and
he
reared
his
bow
and
drew
his
arrow
to
the
head
nay
nay
cried
margaret
and
seized
the
arrow
it
broke
in
half
the
pieces
fell
on
each
side
the
bow
the
air
at
the
same
time
filled
with
the
tongues
of
the
hounds
they
were
hot
upon
the
scent
what
have
you
done
wench
you
have
put
the
halter
round
my
no
cried
margaret
i
have
saved
you
stand
back
from
the
window
both
your
knife
quick
she
seized
his
knife
almost
tore
it
out
of
his
girdle
and
darted
from
the
room
the
house
was
now
surrounded
with
baying
dogs
and
shouting
men
the
glowworm
eyes
moved
not
chapter
ix
margaret
cut
off
a
huge
piece
of
venison
and
ran
to
the
window
and
threw
it
out
to
the
green
eyes
of
fire
they
darted
on
to
it
with
a
savage
snarl
and
there
was
a
sound
of
rending
and
crunching
at
this
moment
a
hound
uttered
a
bay
so
near
and
loud
it
rang
through
the
house
and
the
three
at
the
window
shrank
together
then
the
leopard
feared
for
her
supper
and
glided
swiftly
and
stealthily
away
with
it
towards
the
woods
and
the
very
next
moment
horses
and
men
and
dogs
came
past
the
window
and
followed
her
full
cry
martin
and
his
companions
breathed
again
the
leopard
was
swift
and
would
not
be
caught
within
a
league
of
their
house
they
grasped
hands
margaret
seized
this
opportunity
and
cried
a
little
gerard
kissed
the
tears
away
to
table
once
more
and
gerard
drank
to
woman
wit
is
stronger
than
man
force
said
he
ay
said
margaret
when
those
she
loves
are
in
danger
not
gerard
stayed
with
her
longer
than
usual
and
went
home
prouder
than
ever
of
her
and
happy
as
a
prince
some
little
distance
from
home
under
the
shadow
of
some
trees
he
encountered
two
figures
they
almost
barred
his
way
it
was
his
father
and
mother
out
so
late
what
could
be
the
cause
a
chill
fell
on
him
he
stopped
and
looked
at
them
they
stood
grim
and
silent
he
stammered
out
some
words
of
inquiry
why
ask
said
the
father
you
know
why
we
are
oh
gerard
said
his
mother
with
a
voice
full
of
reproach
yet
of
affection
gerard
heart
quaked
he
was
silent
then
his
father
pitied
his
confusion
and
said
to
him
nay
you
need
not
to
hang
your
head
you
are
not
the
first
young
fool
that
has
been
caught
by
a
red
cheek
and
a
pair
of
blue
nay
nay
put
in
catherine
it
was
witchcraft
peter
the
magician
is
well
known
for
come
sir
priest
resumed
his
father
you
know
you
must
not
meddle
with
women
folk
but
give
us
your
promise
to
go
no
more
to
sevenbergen
and
here
all
ends
we
wo
be
hard
on
you
for
one
i
can
not
promise
that
not
promise
it
you
young
hypocrite
nay
father
miscall
me
not
i
lacked
courage
to
tell
you
what
i
knew
would
vex
you
and
right
grateful
am
i
to
that
good
friend
whoever
he
be
that
has
let
you
wot
is
a
load
off
my
mind
yes
father
i
love
margaret
and
call
me
not
a
priest
for
a
priest
i
will
never
be
i
will
die
that
we
shall
see
young
man
come
gainsay
me
no
more
you
will
learn
what
is
to
disrespect
a
gerard
held
his
peace
and
the
three
walked
home
in
gloomy
silence
broken
only
by
a
deep
sigh
or
two
from
catherine
from
that
hour
the
little
house
at
tergou
was
no
longer
the
abode
of
peace
gerard
was
taken
to
task
next
day
before
the
whole
family
and
every
voice
was
loud
against
him
except
little
kate
and
the
dwarf
who
was
apt
to
take
his
cue
from
her
without
knowing
why
as
for
cornelis
and
sybrandt
they
were
bitterer
than
their
father
gerard
was
dismayed
at
finding
so
many
enemies
and
looked
wistfully
into
his
little
sister
face
her
eyes
were
brimming
at
the
harsh
words
showered
on
one
who
but
yesterday
was
the
universal
pet
but
she
gave
him
no
encouragement
she
turned
her
head
away
from
him
and
said
dear
dear
gerard
pray
to
heaven
to
cure
you
of
this
folly
what
are
you
against
me
too
said
gerard
sadly
and
he
rose
with
a
deep
sigh
and
left
the
house
and
went
to
sevenbergen
the
beginning
of
a
quarrel
where
the
parties
are
bound
by
affection
though
opposed
in
interest
and
sentiment
is
comparatively
innocent
both
are
perhaps
in
the
right
at
first
starting
and
then
it
is
that
a
calm
judicious
friend
capable
of
seeing
both
sides
is
a
gift
from
heaven
for
the
longer
the
dissension
endures
the
wider
and
deeper
it
grows
by
the
fallibility
and
irascibility
of
human
nature
these
are
not
confined
to
either
side
and
finally
the
invariable
end
is
reached
both
in
the
wrong
the
combatants
were
unequally
matched
elias
was
angry
cornelis
and
sybrandt
spiteful
but
gerard
having
a
larger
and
more
cultivated
mind
saw
both
sides
where
they
saw
but
one
and
had
fits
of
irresolution
and
was
not
wroth
but
unhappy
he
was
lonely
too
in
this
struggle
he
could
open
his
heart
to
no
one
margaret
was
a
girl
he
dared
not
tell
her
what
he
had
to
endure
at
home
she
was
capable
of
siding
with
his
relations
by
resigning
him
though
at
the
cost
of
her
own
happiness
margaret
van
eyck
had
been
a
great
comfort
to
him
on
another
occasion
but
now
he
dared
not
make
her
his
confidant
her
own
history
was
well
known
in
early
life
she
had
many
offers
of
marriage
but
refused
them
all
for
the
sake
of
that
art
to
which
a
wife
and
mother
duties
are
so
fatal
thus
she
remained
single
and
painted
with
her
brothers
how
could
he
tell
her
that
he
declined
the
benefice
she
had
got
him
and
declined
it
for
the
sake
of
that
which
at
his
age
she
had
despised
and
sacrificed
so
lightly
gerard
at
this
period
bade
fair
to
succumb
but
the
other
side
had
a
horrible
ally
in
catherine
senior
this
but
uneducated
woman
could
not
like
her
daughter
act
quietly
and
firmly
still
less
could
she
act
upon
a
plan
she
irritated
gerard
at
times
and
so
helped
him
for
anger
is
a
great
sustainer
of
the
courage
at
others
she
turned
round
in
a
moment
and
made
onslaughts
on
her
own
forces
to
take
a
single
instance
out
of
many
one
day
that
they
were
all
at
home
catherine
and
all
cornelis
said
our
gerard
wed
margaret
brandt
why
it
is
hunger
marrying
and
what
will
it
be
when
you
marry
cried
catherine
gerard
can
paint
gerard
can
write
but
what
can
you
do
to
keep
a
woman
ye
lazy
loon
nought
but
wait
for
your
father
shoon
oh
we
can
see
why
you
and
sybrandt
would
not
have
the
poor
boy
to
marry
you
are
afraid
he
will
come
to
us
for
a
share
of
our
substance
and
say
that
he
does
and
say
that
we
give
it
him
it
is
yourn
we
part
from
and
mayhap
never
will
on
these
occasions
gerard
smiled
slily
and
picked
up
heart
and
temporary
confusion
fell
on
catherine
unfortunate
allies
but
at
last
after
more
than
six
months
of
irritation
came
the
climax
the
father
told
the
son
before
the
whole
family
he
had
ordered
the
burgomaster
to
imprison
him
in
the
stadthouse
rather
than
let
him
marry
margaret
gerard
turned
pale
with
anger
at
this
but
by
a
great
effort
held
his
peace
his
father
went
on
to
say
and
a
priest
you
shall
be
before
the
year
is
out
is
it
so
cried
gerard
then
hear
me
all
by
god
and
bavon
i
swear
i
will
never
be
a
priest
while
margaret
lives
since
force
is
to
decide
it
and
not
love
and
duty
try
force
father
but
force
shall
not
serve
you
for
the
day
i
see
the
burgomaster
come
for
me
i
leave
tergou
for
ever
and
holland
too
and
my
father
house
where
it
seems
i
have
been
valued
all
these
years
not
for
myself
but
for
what
is
to
be
got
out
of
and
he
flung
out
of
the
room
white
with
anger
and
desperation
there
cried
catherine
that
comes
of
driving
young
folks
too
hard
but
men
are
crueller
than
tigers
even
to
their
own
flesh
and
blood
now
heaven
forbid
he
should
ever
leave
us
married
or
as
gerard
came
out
of
the
house
his
cheeks
pale
and
his
heart
panting
he
met
reicht
heynes
she
had
a
message
for
him
margaret
van
eyck
desired
to
see
him
he
found
the
old
lady
seated
grim
as
a
judge
she
wasted
no
time
in
preliminaries
but
inquired
coldly
why
he
had
not
visited
her
of
late
before
he
could
answer
she
said
in
a
sarcastic
tone
i
thought
we
had
been
friends
young
at
this
gerard
looked
the
picture
of
doubt
and
consternation
it
is
because
you
never
told
her
you
were
in
love
said
reicht
heynes
pitying
his
confusion
silence
wench
why
should
he
tell
us
his
affairs
we
are
not
his
friends
we
have
not
deserved
his
alas
my
second
mother
said
gerard
i
did
not
dare
to
tell
you
my
what
folly
is
it
folly
to
love
i
am
told
so
every
day
of
my
you
need
not
have
been
afraid
to
tell
my
mistress
she
is
always
kind
to
true
madam
reicht
i
was
afraid
because
i
was
told
well
you
were
told
that
in
your
youth
you
scorned
love
preferring
i
did
boy
and
what
is
the
end
of
it
behold
me
here
a
barren
stock
while
the
women
of
my
youth
have
a
troop
of
children
at
their
side
and
grandchildren
at
their
knee
i
gave
up
the
sweet
joys
of
wifehood
and
motherhood
for
what
for
my
dear
brothers
they
have
gone
and
left
me
long
ago
for
my
art
it
has
all
but
left
me
too
i
have
the
knowledge
still
but
what
avails
that
when
the
hand
trembles
no
gerard
i
look
on
you
as
my
son
you
are
good
you
are
handsome
you
are
a
painter
though
not
like
some
i
have
known
i
will
not
let
you
throw
your
youth
away
as
i
did
mine
you
shall
marry
this
margaret
i
have
inquired
and
she
is
a
good
daughter
reicht
here
is
a
gossip
she
has
told
me
all
about
it
but
that
need
not
hinder
you
to
tell
poor
gerard
was
overjoyed
to
be
permitted
to
praise
margaret
aloud
and
to
one
who
could
understand
what
he
loved
in
her
soon
there
were
two
pair
of
wet
eyes
over
his
story
and
when
the
poor
boy
saw
that
there
were
three
women
are
creatures
brimful
of
courage
theirs
is
not
exactly
the
same
quality
as
manly
courage
that
would
never
do
hang
it
all
we
should
have
to
give
up
trampling
on
them
no
it
is
a
vicarious
courage
they
never
take
part
in
a
by
any
chance
but
it
is
remarked
that
they
sit
at
one
unshaken
by
those
tremors
and
apprehensions
for
the
combatants
to
which
the
male
spectator
wretch
is
subject
nothing
can
exceed
the
resolution
with
which
they
have
been
known
to
send
forth
men
to
battle
as
some
witty
dog
says
les
femmes
sont
tres
braves
avec
le
peur
by
this
trait
gerard
now
profited
margaret
and
reicht
were
agreed
that
a
man
should
always
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
gerard
only
course
was
to
marry
margaret
brandt
the
old
people
would
come
to
after
a
while
the
deed
once
done
whereas
the
longer
this
misunderstanding
continued
on
its
present
footing
the
worse
for
all
parties
especially
for
gerard
see
how
pale
and
thin
they
have
made
him
amongst
indeed
you
are
master
gerard
said
reicht
it
makes
a
body
sad
to
see
a
young
man
so
wasted
and
worn
mistress
when
i
met
him
in
the
street
i
had
liked
to
have
burst
out
crying
he
was
so
changed
and
i
be
bound
the
others
keep
their
colour
ah
reicht
such
as
it
oh
i
see
no
odds
in
of
course
not
we
painters
are
no
match
for
boors
we
are
glass
they
are
stone
we
ca
stand
the
worry
worry
worry
of
little
minds
and
it
is
not
for
the
good
of
mankind
we
should
be
exposed
to
it
it
is
hard
enough
heaven
knows
to
design
and
paint
a
masterpiece
without
having
gnats
and
flies
stinging
us
to
death
into
the
exasperated
as
gerard
was
by
his
father
threat
of
violence
he
listened
to
these
friendly
voices
telling
him
the
prudent
course
was
rebellion
but
though
he
listened
he
was
not
convinced
i
do
not
fear
my
father
violence
he
said
but
i
do
fear
his
anger
when
it
came
to
the
point
he
would
not
imprison
me
i
would
marry
margaret
if
that
was
my
only
fear
no
he
would
disown
me
i
should
take
margaret
from
her
father
and
give
her
a
poor
husband
who
would
never
thrive
weighed
down
by
his
parent
curse
madam
i
sometimes
think
if
i
could
marry
her
secretly
and
then
take
her
away
to
some
country
where
my
craft
is
better
paid
than
in
this
and
after
a
year
or
two
when
the
storm
had
blown
over
you
know
could
come
back
with
money
in
my
purse
and
say
dear
parents
we
do
not
seek
your
substance
we
but
ask
you
to
love
us
once
more
as
you
used
and
as
we
have
never
ceased
to
love
you
but
alas
i
shall
be
told
these
are
the
dreams
of
an
inexperienced
young
the
old
lady
eyes
sparkled
it
is
no
dream
but
a
piece
of
wonderful
in
a
boy
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
you
have
spirit
to
carry
out
your
own
thought
there
is
a
country
gerard
where
certain
fortune
awaits
you
at
this
moment
here
the
arts
freeze
but
there
they
flourish
as
they
never
yet
flourished
in
any
age
or
it
is
italy
cried
gerard
it
is
italy
ay
italy
where
painters
are
honoured
like
princes
and
scribes
are
paid
three
hundred
crowns
for
copying
a
single
manuscript
know
you
not
that
his
holiness
the
pope
has
written
to
every
land
for
skilful
scribes
to
copy
the
hundreds
of
precious
manuscripts
that
are
pouring
into
that
favoured
land
from
constantinople
whence
learning
and
learned
men
are
driven
by
the
barbarian
turks
nay
i
know
not
that
but
it
has
been
the
dream
and
hope
of
my
life
to
visit
italy
the
queen
of
all
the
arts
oh
madam
but
the
journey
and
we
are
all
so
find
you
the
heart
to
go
i
find
the
means
i
know
where
to
lay
my
hand
on
ten
golden
angels
they
will
take
you
to
rome
and
the
girl
with
you
if
she
loves
you
as
she
they
sat
till
midnight
over
this
theme
and
after
that
day
gerard
recovered
his
spirits
and
seemed
to
carry
a
secret
talisman
against
all
the
gibes
and
the
harsh
words
that
flew
about
his
ears
at
home
besides
the
money
she
procured
him
for
the
journey
margaret
van
eyck
gave
him
money
worth
said
she
i
will
tell
you
secrets
that
i
learned
from
masters
that
are
gone
from
me
and
have
left
no
fellow
behind
even
the
italians
know
them
not
and
what
i
tell
you
now
in
tergou
you
shall
sell
here
in
florence
note
my
brother
jan
pictures
time
which
fades
all
other
paintings
leaves
his
colours
bright
as
the
day
they
left
the
easel
the
reason
is
he
did
nothing
blindly
in
a
hurry
he
trusted
to
no
hireling
to
grind
his
colours
he
did
it
himself
or
saw
it
done
his
panel
was
prepared
and
prepared
again
i
will
show
you
how
a
year
before
he
laid
his
colour
on
most
of
them
are
quite
content
to
have
their
work
sucked
up
and
lost
sooner
than
not
be
in
a
hurry
bad
painters
are
always
in
a
hurry
above
all
gerard
i
warn
you
use
but
little
oil
and
never
boil
it
boiling
it
melts
that
vegetable
dross
into
its
heart
which
it
is
our
business
to
clear
away
for
impure
oil
is
death
to
colour
no
take
your
oil
and
pour
it
into
a
bottle
with
water
in
a
day
or
two
the
water
will
turn
muddy
that
is
muck
from
the
oil
pour
the
dirty
water
carefully
away
and
add
fresh
when
that
is
poured
away
you
will
fancy
the
oil
is
clear
mistaken
reicht
fetch
me
that
reicht
brought
a
glass
trough
with
a
glass
lid
fitting
tight
when
your
oil
has
been
washed
in
bottle
put
it
into
this
trough
with
water
and
put
the
trough
in
the
sun
all
day
you
will
soon
see
the
water
turbid
again
but
mark
you
must
not
carry
this
game
too
far
or
the
sun
will
turn
your
oil
to
varnish
when
it
is
as
clear
as
crystal
not
too
luscious
drain
carefully
and
cork
it
up
tight
grind
your
own
prime
colours
and
lay
them
on
with
this
oil
and
they
shall
live
hubert
would
put
sand
or
salt
in
the
water
to
clear
the
oil
quicker
but
jan
used
to
say
will
do
it
best
give
water
time
jan
van
eyck
was
never
in
a
hurry
and
that
is
why
the
world
will
not
forget
him
in
a
this
and
several
other
receipts
quae
nunc
perscribere
longum
est
margaret
gave
him
with
sparkling
eyes
and
gerard
received
them
like
a
legacy
from
heaven
so
interesting
are
some
things
that
read
uninteresting
thus
provided
with
money
and
knowledge
gerard
decided
to
marry
and
fly
with
his
wife
to
italy
nothing
remained
now
but
to
inform
margaret
brandt
of
his
resolution
and
to
publish
the
banns
as
quietly
as
possible
he
went
to
sevenbergen
earlier
than
usual
on
both
these
errands
he
began
with
margaret
told
her
of
the
dame
van
goodness
and
the
resolution
he
had
come
to
at
last
and
invited
her
she
refused
it
plump
no
gerard
you
and
i
have
never
spoken
of
your
family
but
when
you
come
to
marriage
she
stopped
then
began
again
i
do
think
your
father
has
no
to
me
more
than
to
another
he
told
peter
buyskens
as
much
and
peter
told
me
but
so
long
as
he
is
bent
on
your
being
a
priest
you
ought
have
told
me
this
instead
of
i
you
i
could
not
marry
you
gerard
dearly
as
i
love
gerard
strove
in
vain
to
shake
this
resolution
he
found
it
very
easy
to
make
her
cry
but
impossible
to
make
her
yield
then
gerard
was
impatient
and
unjust
very
well
he
cried
then
you
are
on
their
side
and
you
will
drive
me
to
be
a
priest
for
this
must
end
one
way
or
another
my
parents
hate
me
in
earnest
but
my
lover
only
loves
me
in
and
with
this
wild
bitter
speech
he
flung
away
home
again
and
left
margaret
weeping
when
a
man
misbehaves
the
effect
is
curious
on
a
girl
who
loves
him
sincerely
it
makes
her
pity
him
this
to
some
of
us
males
seems
anything
but
logical
the
fault
is
in
our
own
eye
the
logic
is
too
swift
for
us
the
girl
argues
thus
how
unhappy
how
vexed
how
poor
he
must
be
to
misbehave
poor
thing
margaret
was
full
of
this
sweet
womanly
pity
when
to
her
great
surprise
scarce
an
hour
and
a
half
after
he
left
her
gerard
came
running
back
to
her
with
the
fragments
of
a
picture
in
his
hand
and
panting
with
anger
and
grief
there
margaret
see
see
the
wretches
look
at
their
spite
they
have
cut
your
portrait
to
margaret
looked
and
sure
enough
some
malicious
hand
had
cut
her
portrait
into
five
pieces
she
was
a
good
girl
but
she
was
not
ice
she
turned
red
to
her
very
forehead
who
did
it
nay
i
know
not
i
dared
not
ask
for
i
should
hate
the
hand
that
did
it
ay
till
my
dying
day
my
poor
margaret
the
butchers
the
ruffians
six
months
work
cut
out
of
my
life
and
nothing
to
show
for
it
now
see
they
have
hacked
through
your
very
face
the
sweet
face
that
every
one
loves
who
knows
it
oh
heartless
merciless
vipers
never
mind
gerard
said
margaret
panting
since
this
is
how
they
treat
you
for
my
sake
ye
rob
him
of
my
portrait
do
ye
well
then
he
shall
have
the
face
itself
such
as
it
oh
margaret
yes
gerard
since
they
are
so
cruel
i
will
be
the
kinder
forgive
me
for
refusing
you
i
will
be
your
wife
if
it
is
your
gerard
kissed
her
hands
with
rapture
and
then
her
lips
and
in
a
tumult
of
joy
ran
for
peter
and
martin
they
came
and
witnessed
the
betrothal
a
solemn
ceremony
in
those
days
and
indeed
for
more
than
a
century
later
though
now
abolished
chapter
x
the
banns
of
marriage
had
to
be
read
three
times
as
in
our
days
with
this
difference
that
they
were
commonly
read
on
and
the
young
couple
easily
persuaded
the
cure
to
do
the
three
readings
in
hours
he
was
new
to
the
place
and
their
looks
spoke
volumes
in
their
favour
they
were
cried
on
monday
at
matins
and
at
vespers
and
to
their
great
delight
nobody
from
tergou
was
in
the
church
the
next
morning
they
were
both
there
palpitating
with
anxiety
when
to
their
horror
a
stranger
stood
up
and
forbade
the
banns
on
the
score
that
the
parties
were
not
of
age
and
their
parents
not
consenting
outside
the
church
door
margaret
and
gerard
held
a
trembling
and
almost
despairing
consultation
but
before
they
could
settle
anything
the
man
who
had
done
them
so
ill
a
turn
approached
and
gave
them
to
understand
that
he
was
very
sorry
to
interfere
that
his
inclination
was
to
further
the
happiness
of
the
young
but
that
in
point
of
fact
his
only
means
of
getting
a
living
was
by
forbidding
banns
what
then
the
young
people
give
me
a
crown
and
i
undo
my
work
handsomely
tell
the
cure
i
was
misinformed
and
all
goes
a
crown
i
will
give
you
a
golden
angel
to
do
this
said
gerard
eagerly
the
man
consented
as
eagerly
and
went
with
gerard
to
the
cure
and
told
him
he
had
made
a
ridiculous
mistake
which
a
sight
of
the
parties
had
rectified
on
this
the
cure
agreed
to
marry
the
young
couple
next
day
at
ten
and
the
professional
obstructor
of
bliss
went
home
with
gerard
angel
like
most
of
these
very
clever
knaves
he
was
a
fool
and
proceeded
to
drink
his
angel
at
a
certain
hostelry
in
tergou
where
was
a
green
devoted
to
archery
and
the
common
sports
of
the
day
there
being
drunk
he
bragged
of
his
day
exploit
and
who
should
be
there
imbibing
every
word
but
a
great
frequenter
of
the
spot
the
sybrandt
sybrandt
ran
home
to
tell
his
father
his
father
was
not
at
home
he
was
gone
to
rotterdam
to
buy
cloth
of
the
merchants
catching
his
elder
brother
eye
he
made
him
a
signal
to
come
out
and
told
him
what
he
had
heard
there
are
black
sheep
in
nearly
every
large
family
and
these
two
were
gerard
black
brothers
idleness
is
vitiating
waiting
for
the
death
of
those
we
ought
to
love
is
vitiating
and
these
two
curs
were
ready
to
tear
any
one
to
death
that
should
interfere
with
that
miserable
inheritance
which
was
their
thought
by
day
and
their
dream
by
night
their
parents
parsimony
was
a
virtue
it
was
accompanied
by
industry
and
its
motive
was
love
of
their
offspring
but
in
these
perverse
and
selfish
hearts
that
homely
virtue
was
perverted
into
avarice
than
which
no
more
fruitful
source
of
crimes
is
to
be
found
in
nature
they
put
their
heads
together
and
agreed
not
to
tell
their
mother
whose
sentiments
were
so
uncertain
but
to
go
first
to
the
burgomaster
they
were
cunning
enough
to
see
that
he
was
averse
to
the
match
though
they
could
not
divine
why
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
saw
through
them
at
once
but
he
took
care
not
to
let
them
see
through
him
he
heard
their
story
and
putting
on
magisterial
dignity
and
coldness
he
said
since
the
father
of
the
family
is
not
here
his
duty
falleth
on
me
who
am
the
father
of
the
town
i
know
your
father
mind
leave
all
to
me
and
above
all
tell
not
a
woman
a
word
of
this
least
of
all
the
women
that
are
in
your
own
house
for
chattering
tongues
mar
wisest
so
he
dismissed
them
a
little
superciliously
he
was
ashamed
of
his
confederates
on
their
return
home
they
found
their
brother
gerard
seated
on
a
low
stool
at
their
mother
knee
she
was
caressing
his
hair
with
her
hand
speaking
very
kindly
to
him
and
promising
to
take
his
part
with
his
father
and
thwart
his
love
no
more
the
main
cause
of
this
change
of
mind
was
characteristic
of
the
woman
she
it
was
who
in
a
moment
of
female
irritation
had
cut
margaret
picture
to
pieces
she
had
watched
the
effect
with
some
misgivings
and
had
seen
gerard
turn
pale
as
death
and
sit
motionless
like
a
bereaved
creature
with
the
pieces
in
his
hands
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
them
till
tears
came
and
blinded
them
then
she
was
terrified
at
what
she
had
done
and
next
her
heart
smote
her
bitterly
and
she
wept
sore
apart
but
being
what
she
was
dared
not
own
it
but
said
to
herself
i
not
say
a
word
but
i
make
it
up
to
and
her
bowels
yearned
over
her
son
and
her
feeble
violence
died
a
natural
death
and
she
was
transferring
her
fatal
alliance
to
gerard
when
the
two
black
sheep
came
in
gerard
knew
nothing
of
the
immediate
cause
on
the
contrary
inexperienced
as
he
was
in
the
ins
and
outs
of
females
her
kindness
made
him
ashamed
of
a
suspicion
he
had
entertained
that
she
was
the
depredator
and
he
kissed
her
again
and
again
and
went
to
bed
happy
as
a
prince
to
think
his
mother
was
his
mother
once
more
at
the
very
crisis
of
his
fate
the
next
morning
at
ten
gerard
and
margaret
were
in
the
church
at
sevenbergen
he
radiant
with
joy
she
with
blushes
peter
was
also
there
and
martin
wittenhaagen
but
no
other
friend
secrecy
was
everything
margaret
had
declined
italy
she
could
not
leave
her
father
he
was
too
learned
and
too
helpless
but
it
was
settled
they
should
retire
into
flanders
for
a
few
weeks
until
the
storm
should
be
blown
over
at
tergou
the
cure
did
not
keep
them
waiting
long
though
it
seemed
an
age
presently
he
stood
at
the
altar
and
called
them
to
him
they
went
hand
in
hand
the
happiest
in
holland
the
cure
opened
his
book
but
ere
he
uttered
a
single
word
of
the
sacred
rite
a
harsh
voice
cried
forbear
and
the
constables
of
tergou
came
up
the
aisle
and
seized
gerard
in
the
name
of
the
law
martin
long
knife
flashed
out
directly
forbear
man
cried
the
priest
what
draw
your
weapon
in
a
church
and
ye
who
interrupt
this
holy
sacrament
what
means
this
impiety
there
is
no
impiety
father
said
the
burgomaster
servant
respectfully
this
young
man
would
marry
against
his
father
will
and
his
father
has
prayed
our
burgomaster
to
deal
with
him
according
to
the
law
let
him
deny
it
if
he
is
this
so
young
man
gerard
hung
his
head
we
take
him
to
rotterdam
to
abide
the
sentence
of
the
at
this
margaret
uttered
a
cry
of
despair
and
the
young
creatures
who
were
so
happy
a
moment
ago
fell
to
sobbing
in
one
another
arms
so
piteously
that
the
instruments
of
oppression
drew
back
a
step
and
were
ashamed
but
one
of
them
that
was
stepped
up
under
pretence
of
separating
them
and
whispered
to
margaret
rotterdam
it
is
a
lie
we
but
take
him
to
our
they
took
him
away
on
horseback
on
the
road
to
rotterdam
and
after
a
dozen
halts
and
by
sly
detours
to
tergou
just
outside
the
town
they
were
met
by
a
rude
vehicle
covered
with
canvas
gerard
was
put
into
this
and
about
five
in
the
evening
was
secretly
conveyed
into
the
prison
of
the
stadthouse
he
was
taken
up
several
flights
of
stairs
and
thrust
into
a
small
room
lighted
only
by
a
narrow
window
with
a
vertical
iron
bar
the
whole
furniture
was
a
huge
oak
chest
imprisonment
in
that
age
was
one
of
the
highroads
to
death
it
is
horrible
in
its
mildest
form
but
in
those
days
it
implied
cold
unbroken
solitude
torture
starvation
and
often
poison
gerard
felt
he
was
in
the
hands
of
an
enemy
oh
the
look
that
man
gave
me
on
the
road
to
rotterdam
there
is
more
here
than
my
father
wrath
i
doubt
i
shall
see
no
more
the
light
of
and
he
kneeled
down
and
commended
his
soul
to
god
presently
he
rose
and
sprang
at
the
iron
bar
of
the
window
and
clutched
it
this
enabled
him
to
look
out
by
pressing
his
knees
against
the
wall
it
was
but
for
a
minute
but
in
that
minute
he
saw
a
sight
such
as
none
but
a
captive
can
appreciate
martin
wittenhaagen
back
martin
was
sitting
quietly
fishing
in
the
brook
near
the
stadthouse
gerard
sprang
again
at
the
window
and
whistled
martin
instantly
showed
that
he
was
watching
much
harder
than
fishing
he
turned
hastily
round
and
saw
gerard
made
him
a
signal
and
taking
up
his
line
and
bow
went
quickly
off
gerard
saw
by
this
that
his
friends
were
not
idle
yet
had
rather
martin
had
stayed
the
very
sight
of
him
was
a
comfort
he
held
on
looking
at
the
soldier
retiring
form
as
long
as
he
could
then
falling
back
somewhat
heavily
wrenched
the
rusty
iron
bar
held
only
by
rusty
nails
away
from
the
just
as
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
opened
the
door
stealthily
behind
him
the
burgomaster
eye
fell
instantly
on
the
iron
and
then
glanced
at
the
window
but
he
said
nothing
the
window
was
a
hundred
feet
from
the
ground
and
if
gerard
had
a
fancy
for
jumping
out
why
should
he
balk
it
he
brought
a
brown
loaf
and
a
pitcher
of
water
and
set
them
on
the
chest
in
solemn
silence
gerard
first
impulse
was
to
brain
him
with
the
iron
bar
and
fly
down
the
stairs
but
the
burgomaster
seeing
something
wicked
in
his
eye
gave
a
little
cough
and
three
stout
fellows
armed
showed
themselves
directly
at
the
door
my
orders
are
to
keep
you
thus
until
you
shall
bind
yourself
by
an
oath
to
leave
margaret
brandt
and
return
to
the
church
to
which
you
have
belonged
from
your
death
with
all
my
and
the
burgomaster
retired
martin
went
with
all
speed
to
sevenbergen
there
he
found
margaret
pale
and
agitated
but
full
of
resolution
and
energy
she
was
just
finishing
a
letter
to
the
countess
charolois
appealing
to
her
against
the
violence
and
treachery
of
ghysbrecht
courage
cried
martin
on
entering
i
have
found
him
he
is
in
the
haunted
tower
right
at
the
top
of
it
ay
i
know
the
place
many
a
poor
fellow
has
gone
up
there
straight
and
come
down
feet
he
then
told
them
how
he
had
looked
up
and
seen
gerard
face
at
a
window
that
was
like
a
slit
in
the
wall
oh
martin
how
did
he
look
what
mean
you
he
looked
like
gerard
but
was
he
pale
a
looked
he
anxious
looked
he
like
one
doomed
nay
nay
as
bright
as
a
pewter
you
mock
me
stay
then
that
must
have
been
at
sight
of
you
he
counts
on
us
oh
what
shall
we
do
martin
good
friend
take
this
at
once
to
martin
held
out
his
hand
for
the
letter
peter
had
sat
silent
all
this
time
but
pondering
and
yet
contrary
to
custom
keenly
attentive
to
what
was
going
on
around
him
put
not
your
trust
in
princes
said
he
alas
what
else
have
we
to
trust
in
father
your
learning
will
not
serve
us
how
know
you
that
wit
has
been
too
strong
for
iron
bars
ere
ay
father
but
nature
is
stronger
than
wit
and
she
is
against
us
think
of
the
height
no
ladder
in
holland
might
reach
i
need
no
ladder
what
i
need
is
a
gold
nay
i
have
money
for
that
matter
i
have
nine
angels
gerard
gave
them
me
to
keep
but
what
do
they
avail
the
burgomaster
will
not
be
bribed
to
let
gerard
what
do
they
avail
give
me
but
one
crown
and
the
young
man
shall
sup
with
us
this
peter
spoke
so
eagerly
and
confidently
that
for
a
moment
margaret
felt
hopeful
but
she
caught
martin
eye
dwelling
upon
him
with
an
expression
of
benevolent
contempt
it
passes
the
powers
of
man
invention
said
she
with
a
deep
sigh
invention
cried
the
old
man
a
fig
for
invention
what
need
we
invention
at
this
time
of
day
everything
has
been
said
that
is
to
be
said
and
done
that
ever
will
be
done
i
shall
tell
you
how
a
florentine
knight
was
shut
up
in
a
tower
higher
than
gerard
yet
did
his
faithful
squire
stand
at
the
tower
foot
and
get
him
out
with
no
other
engine
than
that
in
your
hand
martin
and
certain
kickshaws
i
shall
buy
for
a
martin
looked
at
his
bow
and
turned
it
round
in
his
hand
and
seemed
to
interrogate
it
but
the
examination
left
him
as
incredulous
as
before
then
peter
told
them
his
story
how
the
faithful
squire
got
the
knight
out
of
a
high
tower
at
brescia
the
manoeuvre
like
most
things
that
are
really
scientific
was
so
simple
that
now
their
wonder
was
they
had
taken
for
impossible
what
was
not
even
difficult
the
letter
never
went
to
rotterdam
they
trusted
to
peter
learning
and
their
own
dexterity
it
was
nine
on
a
clear
moonlight
night
gerard
senior
was
still
away
the
rest
of
his
little
family
had
been
some
time
abed
a
figure
stood
by
the
dwarf
bed
it
was
white
and
the
moonlight
shone
on
it
with
an
unearthly
noise
between
a
yell
and
a
snarl
the
gymnast
rolled
off
his
bed
and
under
it
by
a
single
unbroken
movement
a
soft
voice
followed
him
in
his
retreat
why
giles
are
you
afeard
of
me
at
this
giles
head
peeped
cautiously
up
and
he
saw
it
was
only
his
sister
kate
she
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
hush
lest
the
wicked
cornelis
or
the
wicked
sybrandt
hear
giles
claws
seized
the
side
of
the
bed
and
he
returned
to
his
place
by
one
undivided
gymnastic
kate
then
revealed
to
giles
that
she
had
heard
cornelis
and
sybrandt
mention
gerard
name
and
being
herself
in
great
anxiety
at
his
not
coming
home
all
day
had
listened
at
their
door
and
had
made
a
fearful
discovery
gerard
was
in
prison
in
the
haunted
tower
of
the
stadthouse
he
was
there
it
seemed
by
their
father
authority
but
here
must
be
some
treachery
for
how
could
their
father
have
ordered
this
cruel
act
he
was
at
rotterdam
she
ended
by
entreating
giles
to
bear
her
company
to
the
foot
of
the
haunted
tower
to
say
a
word
of
comfort
to
poor
gerard
and
let
him
know
their
father
was
absent
and
would
be
sure
to
release
him
on
his
return
dear
giles
i
would
go
alone
but
i
am
afeard
of
the
spirits
that
men
say
do
haunt
the
tower
but
with
you
i
shall
not
be
nor
i
with
you
said
giles
i
do
believe
there
are
any
spirits
in
tergou
i
never
saw
one
this
last
was
the
likest
one
ever
i
saw
and
it
was
but
you
kate
after
in
less
than
half
an
hour
giles
and
kate
opened
the
housedoor
cautiously
and
issued
forth
she
made
him
carry
a
lantern
though
the
night
was
bright
the
lantern
gives
me
more
courage
against
the
evil
spirits
said
she
the
first
day
of
imprisonment
is
very
trying
especially
if
to
the
horror
of
captivity
is
added
the
horror
of
utter
solitude
i
observe
that
in
our
own
day
a
great
many
persons
commit
suicide
during
the
first
hours
of
the
solitary
cell
this
is
doubtless
why
our
jairi
abstain
so
carefully
from
the
impertinence
of
watching
their
little
experiment
upon
the
human
soul
at
that
particular
stage
of
it
as
the
sun
declined
gerard
heart
too
sank
and
sank
with
the
waning
light
even
the
embers
of
hope
went
out
he
was
faint
too
with
hunger
for
he
was
afraid
to
eat
the
food
ghysbrecht
had
brought
him
and
hunger
alone
cows
men
he
sat
upon
the
chest
his
arms
and
his
head
drooping
before
him
a
picture
of
despondency
suddenly
something
struck
the
wall
beyond
him
very
sharply
and
then
rattled
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
it
was
an
arrow
he
saw
the
white
feather
a
chill
ran
through
him
they
meant
then
to
assassinate
him
from
the
outside
he
crouched
no
more
missiles
came
he
crawled
on
all
fours
and
took
up
the
arrow
there
was
no
head
to
it
he
uttered
a
cry
of
hope
had
a
friendly
hand
shot
it
he
took
it
up
and
felt
it
all
over
he
found
a
soft
substance
attached
to
it
then
one
of
his
eccentricities
was
of
grand
use
to
him
his
enabled
him
to
strike
a
light
it
showed
him
two
things
that
made
his
heart
bound
with
delight
none
the
less
thrilling
for
being
somewhat
vague
attached
to
the
arrow
was
a
skein
of
silk
and
on
the
arrow
itself
were
words
written
how
his
eyes
devoured
them
his
heart
panting
the
while
well
beloved
make
fast
the
silk
to
thy
knife
and
lower
to
us
but
hold
thine
end
fast
then
count
an
hundred
and
draw
up
gerard
seized
the
oak
chest
and
with
almost
superhuman
energy
dragged
it
to
the
window
a
moment
ago
he
could
not
have
moved
it
standing
on
the
chest
and
looking
down
he
saw
figures
at
the
tower
foot
they
were
so
indistinct
they
looked
like
one
huge
form
he
waved
his
bonnet
to
them
with
trembling
hand
then
he
undid
the
silk
rapidly
but
carefully
and
made
one
end
fast
to
his
knife
and
lowered
it
till
it
ceased
to
draw
then
he
counted
a
hundred
then
pulled
the
silk
carefully
up
it
came
up
a
little
heavier
at
last
he
came
to
a
large
knot
and
by
that
knot
a
stout
whipcord
was
attached
to
the
silk
what
could
this
mean
while
he
was
puzzling
himself
margaret
voice
came
up
to
him
low
but
clear
draw
up
gerard
till
you
see
at
the
word
gerard
drew
the
whipcord
line
up
and
drew
and
drew
till
he
came
to
another
knot
and
found
a
cord
of
some
thickness
take
the
place
of
the
whipcord
he
had
no
sooner
begun
to
draw
this
up
than
he
found
that
he
had
now
a
heavy
weight
to
deal
with
then
the
truth
suddenly
flashed
on
him
and
he
went
to
work
and
pulled
and
pulled
till
the
perspiration
rolled
down
him
the
weight
got
heavier
and
heavier
and
at
last
he
was
exhausted
looking
down
he
saw
in
the
moonlight
a
sight
that
revived
him
it
was
as
it
were
a
great
snake
coming
up
to
him
out
of
the
deep
shadow
cast
by
the
tower
he
gave
a
shout
of
joy
and
a
score
more
wild
pulls
and
lo
a
stout
new
rope
touched
his
hand
he
hauled
and
hauled
and
dragged
the
end
into
his
prison
and
instantly
passed
it
through
both
handles
of
the
chest
in
succession
and
knotted
it
firmly
then
sat
for
a
moment
to
recover
his
breath
and
collect
his
courage
the
first
thing
was
to
make
sure
that
the
chest
was
sound
and
capable
of
resisting
his
weight
poised
in
he
jumped
with
all
his
force
upon
it
at
the
third
jump
the
whole
side
burst
open
and
out
scuttled
the
contents
a
host
of
parchments
after
the
first
start
and
misgiving
this
gave
him
gerard
comprehended
that
the
chest
had
not
burst
but
opened
he
had
doubtless
jumped
upon
some
secret
spring
still
it
shook
in
some
degree
his
confidence
in
the
chest
powers
of
resistance
so
he
gave
it
an
ally
he
took
the
iron
bar
and
fastened
it
with
the
small
rope
across
the
large
rope
and
across
the
window
he
now
mounted
the
chest
and
from
the
chest
put
his
foot
through
the
window
and
sat
half
in
and
half
out
with
one
hand
on
that
part
of
the
rope
which
was
inside
in
the
silent
night
he
heard
his
own
heart
beat
the
free
air
breathed
on
his
face
and
gave
him
the
courage
to
risk
what
we
must
all
lose
one
day
for
liberty
many
dangers
awaited
him
but
the
greatest
was
the
first
getting
on
to
the
rope
outside
gerard
reflected
finally
he
put
himself
in
the
attitude
of
a
swimmer
his
body
to
the
waist
being
in
the
prison
his
legs
outside
then
holding
the
inside
rope
with
both
hands
he
felt
anxiously
with
his
feet
for
the
outside
rope
and
when
he
had
got
it
he
worked
it
in
between
the
palms
of
his
feet
and
kept
it
there
tight
then
he
uttered
a
short
prayer
and
all
the
calmer
for
it
put
his
left
hand
on
the
sill
and
gradually
wriggled
out
then
he
seized
the
iron
bar
and
for
one
fearful
moment
hung
outside
from
it
by
his
right
hand
while
his
left
hand
felt
for
the
rope
down
at
his
knees
it
was
too
tight
against
the
wall
for
his
fingers
to
get
round
it
higher
up
the
moment
he
had
fairly
grasped
it
he
left
the
bar
and
swiftly
seized
the
rope
with
the
right
hand
too
but
in
this
manoeuvre
his
body
necessarily
fell
about
a
yard
a
stifled
cry
came
up
from
below
gerard
hung
in
he
clenched
his
teeth
and
nipped
the
rope
tight
with
his
feet
and
gripped
it
with
his
hands
and
went
down
slowly
hand
below
hand
he
passed
by
one
huge
rough
stone
after
another
he
saw
there
was
green
moss
on
one
he
looked
up
and
he
looked
down
the
moon
shone
into
his
prison
window
it
seemed
very
near
the
fluttering
figures
below
seemed
an
awful
distance
it
made
him
dizzy
to
look
down
so
he
fixed
his
eyes
steadily
on
the
wall
close
to
him
and
went
slowly
down
down
down
he
passed
a
rusty
slimy
streak
on
the
wall
it
was
some
ten
feet
long
the
rope
made
his
hands
very
hot
he
stole
another
look
up
the
prison
window
was
a
good
way
off
now
down
down
down
down
the
rope
made
his
hands
sore
he
looked
up
the
window
was
so
distant
he
ventured
now
to
turn
his
eyes
downward
again
and
there
not
more
than
thirty
feet
below
him
were
margaret
and
martin
their
faithful
hands
upstretched
to
catch
him
should
he
fall
he
could
see
their
eyes
and
their
teeth
shine
in
the
moonlight
for
their
mouths
were
open
and
they
were
breathing
hard
take
care
gerard
oh
take
care
look
not
fear
me
not
cried
gerard
joyfully
and
eyed
the
wall
but
came
down
faster
in
another
minute
his
feet
were
at
their
hands
they
seized
him
ere
he
touched
the
ground
and
all
three
clung
together
in
one
embrace
hush
away
in
silence
dear
they
stole
along
the
shadow
of
the
wall
now
ere
they
had
gone
many
yards
suddenly
a
stream
of
light
shot
from
an
angle
of
the
building
and
lay
across
their
path
like
a
barrier
of
fire
and
they
heard
whispers
and
footsteps
close
at
hand
back
hissed
martin
keep
in
the
they
hurried
back
passed
the
dangling
rope
and
made
for
a
little
square
projecting
tower
they
had
barely
rounded
it
when
the
light
shot
trembling
past
them
and
flickered
uncertainly
into
the
distance
a
lantern
groaned
martin
in
a
whisper
they
are
after
give
me
my
knife
whispered
gerard
i
never
be
taken
no
no
murmured
margaret
is
there
no
way
out
where
we
are
none
none
but
i
carry
six
lives
at
my
shoulder
and
with
the
word
martin
strung
his
bow
and
fitted
an
arrow
to
the
string
in
war
never
wait
to
be
struck
i
will
kill
one
or
two
ere
they
shall
know
where
their
death
comes
from
then
motioning
his
companions
to
be
quiet
he
began
to
draw
his
bow
and
ere
the
arrow
was
quite
drawn
to
the
head
he
glided
round
the
corner
ready
to
loose
the
string
the
moment
the
enemy
should
offer
a
mark
gerard
and
margaret
held
their
breath
in
horrible
expectation
they
had
never
seen
a
human
being
killed
and
now
a
wild
hope
but
half
repressed
thrilled
through
gerard
that
this
watchful
enemy
might
be
the
burgomaster
in
person
the
soldier
he
knew
would
send
an
arrow
through
a
burgher
or
burgomaster
as
he
would
through
a
boar
in
a
wood
but
who
may
foretell
the
future
however
near
the
bow
instead
of
remaining
firm
and
loosing
the
deadly
shaft
was
seen
to
waver
first
then
shake
violently
and
the
stout
soldier
staggered
back
to
them
his
knees
knocking
and
his
cheeks
blanched
with
fear
he
let
his
arrow
fall
and
clutched
gerard
shoulder
let
me
feel
flesh
and
blood
he
gasped
the
haunted
tower
the
haunted
tower
his
terror
communicated
itself
to
margaret
and
gerard
they
gasped
rather
than
uttered
an
inquiry
hush
he
cried
it
will
hear
you
up
the
wall
it
is
going
up
the
wall
its
head
is
on
fire
up
the
wall
as
mortal
creatures
walk
upon
green
sward
if
you
know
a
prayer
say
it
for
hell
is
loose
i
have
power
to
exorcise
spirits
said
gerard
trembling
i
will
venture
go
alone
then
said
martin
i
have
looked
o
once
and
chapter
xi
the
strange
glance
of
hatred
the
burgomaster
had
cast
on
gerard
coupled
with
his
imprisonment
had
filled
the
young
man
with
a
persuasion
that
ghysbrecht
was
his
enemy
to
the
death
and
he
glided
round
the
angle
of
the
tower
fully
expecting
to
see
no
supernatural
appearance
but
some
cruel
and
treacherous
contrivance
of
a
bad
man
to
do
him
a
mischief
in
that
prison
his
escape
from
which
could
hardly
be
known
as
he
stole
forth
a
soft
but
brave
hand
crept
into
his
and
margaret
was
by
his
side
to
share
this
new
peril
no
sooner
was
the
haunted
tower
visible
than
a
sight
struck
their
eyes
that
benumbed
them
as
they
stood
more
than
halfway
up
the
tower
a
creature
with
a
fiery
head
like
an
enormous
glowworm
was
steadily
mounting
the
wall
the
body
was
dark
but
its
outline
visible
through
the
glare
from
the
head
and
the
whole
creature
not
much
less
than
four
feet
long
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
stood
a
thing
in
white
that
looked
exactly
like
the
figure
of
a
female
gerard
and
margaret
palpitated
with
awe
the
rope
the
rope
it
is
going
up
the
rope
gasped
gerard
as
they
gazed
the
glowworm
disappeared
in
gerard
late
prison
but
its
light
illuminated
the
cell
inside
and
reddened
the
window
the
white
figure
stood
motionless
below
such
as
can
retain
their
senses
after
the
first
prostrating
effect
of
the
supernatural
are
apt
to
experience
terror
in
one
of
its
strangest
forms
a
wild
desire
to
fling
themselves
upon
the
terrible
object
it
fascinates
them
as
the
snake
the
bird
the
great
tragedian
macready
used
to
render
this
finely
in
macbeth
at
banquo
second
appearance
he
flung
himself
with
averted
head
at
the
horrible
shadow
this
strange
impulse
now
seized
margaret
she
put
down
gerard
hand
quietly
and
stood
bewildered
then
all
in
a
moment
with
a
wild
cry
darted
towards
the
spectre
gerard
not
aware
of
the
natural
impulse
i
have
spoken
of
never
doubted
the
evil
one
was
drawing
her
to
her
perdition
he
fell
on
his
knees
exorcizo
vos
in
nomine
beatae
mariae
exorcizo
while
the
exorcist
was
shrieking
his
incantations
in
extremity
of
terror
to
his
infinite
relief
he
heard
the
spectre
utter
a
feeble
cry
of
fear
to
find
that
hell
had
also
its
little
weaknesses
was
encouraging
he
redoubled
his
exorcisms
and
presently
he
saw
the
ghastly
shape
kneeling
at
margaret
knees
and
heard
it
praying
piteously
for
mercy
kate
and
giles
soon
reached
the
haunted
tower
judge
their
surprise
when
they
found
a
new
rope
dangling
from
the
prisoner
window
to
the
ground
i
see
how
it
is
said
the
inferior
intelligence
taking
facts
as
they
came
our
gerard
has
come
down
this
rope
he
has
got
clear
up
i
go
and
no
giles
no
said
the
superior
intelligence
blinded
by
prejudice
see
you
not
this
is
glamour
this
rope
is
a
line
the
evil
one
casts
out
to
wile
thee
to
destruction
he
knows
the
weaknesses
of
all
our
hearts
he
has
seen
how
fond
you
are
of
going
up
things
where
should
our
gerard
procure
a
rope
how
fasten
it
in
the
sky
like
this
it
is
not
in
nature
holy
saints
protect
us
this
night
for
hell
is
stuff
said
the
dwarf
the
way
to
hell
is
down
and
this
rope
leads
up
i
never
had
the
luck
to
go
up
such
a
long
rope
it
may
be
years
ere
i
fall
in
with
such
a
long
rope
all
ready
for
me
as
well
be
knocked
on
the
head
at
once
as
never
know
and
he
sprung
on
to
the
rope
with
a
cry
of
delight
as
a
cat
jumps
with
a
mew
on
to
a
table
where
fish
is
all
the
gymnast
was
on
fire
and
the
only
concession
kate
could
gain
from
him
was
permission
to
fasten
the
lantern
on
his
neck
first
a
light
scares
the
ill
spirits
said
she
and
so
with
his
huge
arms
and
his
legs
like
feathers
giles
went
up
the
rope
faster
than
his
brother
came
down
it
the
light
at
the
nape
of
his
neck
made
a
glowworm
of
him
his
sister
watched
his
progress
with
trembling
anxiety
suddenly
a
female
figure
started
out
of
the
solid
masonry
and
came
flying
at
her
with
more
than
mortal
velocity
kate
uttered
a
feeble
cry
it
was
all
she
could
for
her
tongue
clove
to
her
palate
with
terror
then
she
dropped
her
crutches
and
sank
upon
her
knees
hiding
her
face
and
moaning
take
my
body
but
spare
my
soul
margaret
panting
why
it
is
a
woman
kate
quivering
why
it
is
a
woman
margaret
how
you
scared
me
kate
i
am
scared
enough
myself
oh
oh
oh
this
is
strange
but
the
thing
yet
it
was
with
you
and
you
are
harmless
but
why
are
you
here
at
this
time
of
night
nay
why
are
you
perhaps
we
are
on
the
same
errand
ah
you
are
his
good
sister
kate
and
you
are
margaret
yes
all
the
better
you
love
him
you
are
here
then
giles
was
right
he
has
won
gerard
came
forward
and
put
the
question
at
rest
but
all
further
explanation
was
cut
short
by
a
horrible
unearthly
noise
like
a
sepulchre
ventriloquizing
parchment
parchment
parchment
at
each
repetition
it
rose
in
intensity
they
looked
up
and
there
was
the
dwarf
with
his
hands
full
of
parchments
and
his
face
lighted
with
fiendish
joy
and
lurid
with
diabolical
fire
the
light
being
at
his
neck
a
more
infernal
transparency
never
startled
mortal
eye
with
the
word
the
awful
imp
hurled
parchment
at
the
astonished
heads
below
down
came
records
like
wounded
some
collapsed
others
fluttering
and
others
spread
out
and
wheeling
slowly
down
in
airy
circles
they
had
hardly
settled
when
again
the
sepulchral
roar
was
heard
parchment
parchment
and
down
pattered
and
sailed
another
flock
of
documents
another
followed
they
whitened
the
grass
finally
the
imp
with
his
light
body
and
horny
hands
slid
down
the
rope
like
a
falling
star
and
business
before
sentiment
proposed
to
his
rescued
brother
an
immediate
settlement
for
the
merchandise
he
had
just
delivered
hush
said
gerard
you
speak
too
loud
gather
them
up
and
follow
us
to
a
safer
place
than
will
you
come
home
with
me
gerard
said
little
kate
i
have
no
you
shall
not
say
so
who
is
more
welcome
than
you
will
be
after
this
cruel
wrong
to
your
father
house
father
i
have
no
father
said
gerard
sternly
he
that
was
my
father
is
turned
my
gaoler
i
have
escaped
from
his
hands
i
will
never
come
within
their
reach
an
enemy
did
this
and
not
our
and
she
told
him
what
she
had
overheard
cornelis
and
sybrandt
say
but
the
injury
was
too
recent
to
be
soothed
gerard
showed
a
bitterness
of
indignation
he
had
hitherto
seemed
incapable
of
cornelis
and
sybrandt
are
two
ill
curs
that
have
shown
me
their
teeth
and
their
heart
a
long
while
but
they
could
do
no
more
my
father
it
is
that
gave
the
burgomaster
authority
or
he
durst
not
have
laid
a
finger
on
me
that
am
a
free
burgher
of
this
town
so
be
it
then
i
was
his
son
i
am
his
prisoner
he
has
played
his
part
i
shall
play
mine
farewell
the
burgh
where
i
was
born
and
lived
honestly
and
was
put
in
prison
while
there
is
another
town
left
in
creation
i
never
trouble
you
again
oh
gerard
gerard
margaret
whispered
her
do
not
gainsay
him
now
give
his
choler
time
to
cool
kate
turned
quickly
towards
her
let
me
look
at
your
face
the
inspection
was
favourable
it
seemed
for
she
whispered
it
is
a
comely
face
and
no
fear
me
not
said
margaret
in
the
same
tone
i
could
not
be
happy
without
your
love
as
well
as
these
are
comfortable
words
sobbed
kate
then
looking
up
she
said
i
little
thought
to
like
you
so
well
my
heart
is
willing
but
my
infirmity
will
not
let
me
embrace
at
this
hint
margaret
wound
gently
round
gerard
sister
and
kissed
her
lovingly
often
he
has
spoken
of
you
to
me
kate
and
often
i
longed
for
you
too
gerard
said
kate
kiss
me
ere
you
go
for
my
heart
lies
heavy
at
parting
with
you
this
gerard
kissed
her
and
she
went
on
her
crutches
home
the
last
thing
they
heard
of
her
was
a
little
patient
sigh
then
the
tears
came
and
stood
thick
in
margaret
eyes
but
gerard
was
a
man
and
noticed
not
his
sister
sigh
as
they
turned
to
go
to
sevenbergen
the
dwarf
nudged
gerard
with
his
bundle
of
parchments
and
held
out
a
concave
claw
margaret
dissuaded
gerard
why
take
what
is
not
ours
oh
spoil
an
enemy
how
you
but
may
they
not
make
this
a
handle
for
fresh
violence
how
can
they
think
you
i
shall
stay
in
tergou
after
this
the
burgomaster
robbed
me
of
my
liberty
i
doubt
i
should
take
his
life
for
it
if
i
oh
fie
what
is
life
worth
more
than
liberty
well
i
ca
take
his
life
so
i
take
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
he
gave
giles
a
few
small
coins
with
which
the
urchin
was
gladdened
and
shuffled
after
his
sister
margaret
and
gerard
were
speedily
joined
by
martin
and
away
to
sevenbergen
chapter
xii
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
kept
the
key
of
gerard
prison
in
his
pouch
he
waited
till
ten
of
the
clock
ere
he
visited
for
he
said
to
himself
a
little
hunger
sometimes
does
well
it
breaks
at
ten
he
crept
up
the
stairs
with
a
loaf
and
pitcher
followed
by
his
trusty
servant
well
armed
ghysbrecht
listened
at
the
door
there
was
no
sound
inside
a
grim
smile
stole
over
his
features
by
this
time
he
will
be
as
as
albert
koestein
was
thought
he
he
opened
the
door
no
gerard
ghysbrecht
stood
stupefied
although
his
face
was
not
visible
his
body
seemed
to
lose
all
motion
in
so
peculiar
a
way
and
then
after
a
little
he
fell
trembling
so
that
the
servant
behind
him
saw
there
was
something
amiss
and
crept
close
to
him
and
peeped
over
his
shoulder
at
sight
of
the
empty
cell
and
the
rope
and
iron
bar
he
uttered
a
loud
exclamation
of
wonder
but
his
surprise
doubled
when
his
master
disregarding
all
else
suddenly
flung
himself
on
his
knees
before
the
empty
chest
and
felt
wildly
all
over
it
with
quivering
hands
as
if
unwilling
to
trust
his
eyes
in
a
matter
so
important
the
servant
gazed
at
him
in
utter
bewilderment
why
master
what
is
the
matter
ghysbrecht
pale
lips
worked
as
if
he
was
going
to
answer
but
they
uttered
no
sound
his
hands
fell
by
his
side
and
he
stared
into
the
chest
why
master
what
avails
glaring
into
that
empty
box
the
lad
is
not
there
see
here
note
the
cunning
of
the
young
rogue
he
hath
taken
out
the
bar
and
gone
gone
gone
gone
what
is
gone
holy
saints
he
is
stop
thief
shrieked
ghysbrecht
and
suddenly
turned
on
his
servant
and
collared
him
and
shook
him
with
rage
d
stand
there
knave
and
see
your
master
robbed
run
fly
a
hundred
crowns
to
him
that
finds
it
me
again
no
no
is
in
vain
oh
fool
fool
to
leave
that
in
the
same
room
with
him
but
none
ever
found
the
secret
spring
before
none
ever
would
but
he
it
was
to
be
it
is
to
be
lost
lost
and
his
years
and
infirmity
now
gained
the
better
of
his
frenzy
and
he
sank
on
the
chest
muttering
lost
lost
what
is
lost
master
asked
the
servant
kindly
house
and
lands
and
good
name
groaned
ghysbrecht
and
wrung
his
hands
feebly
what
cried
the
servant
this
emphatic
word
and
the
tone
of
eager
curiosity
struck
on
ghysbrecht
ear
and
revived
his
natural
cunning
i
have
lost
the
town
records
stammered
he
and
he
looked
askant
at
the
man
like
a
fox
caught
near
a
oh
is
that
all
not
enough
what
will
the
burghers
say
to
me
what
will
the
burghs
do
then
he
suddenly
burst
out
again
a
hundred
crowns
to
him
who
shall
recover
them
all
mind
all
that
were
in
this
box
if
one
be
missing
i
give
is
a
bargain
master
the
hundred
crowns
are
in
my
pouch
see
you
not
that
where
gerard
eliassoen
is
there
are
the
pieces
of
sheepskin
you
rate
so
high
that
is
true
that
is
true
good
dierich
good
faithful
dierich
all
mind
all
that
were
in
the
master
i
will
take
the
constables
to
gerard
house
and
seize
him
for
the
the
theft
ay
good
very
good
it
is
theft
i
forgot
that
so
as
he
is
a
thief
now
we
will
put
him
in
the
dungeons
below
where
the
toads
are
and
the
rats
dierich
that
man
must
never
see
daylight
again
is
his
own
fault
he
must
be
prying
quick
quick
ere
he
has
time
to
talk
you
know
time
to
in
less
than
half
an
hour
dierich
brower
and
four
constables
entered
the
hosier
house
and
demanded
young
gerard
of
the
catherine
alas
what
has
he
done
now
cried
she
that
boy
will
break
my
nay
dame
but
a
trick
of
youth
said
dierich
he
hath
but
made
off
with
certain
skins
of
parchment
in
a
frolic
doubtless
but
the
burgomaster
is
answerable
to
the
burgh
for
their
safe
keeping
so
he
is
in
care
about
them
as
for
the
youth
he
will
doubtless
be
quit
for
a
this
smooth
speech
completely
imposed
on
catherine
but
her
daughter
was
more
suspicious
and
that
suspicion
was
strengthened
by
the
disproportionate
anger
and
disappointment
dierich
showed
the
moment
he
learned
gerard
was
not
at
home
had
not
been
at
home
that
night
come
away
then
said
he
roughly
we
are
wasting
he
added
vehemently
i
find
him
if
he
is
above
affection
sharpens
the
wits
and
often
it
has
made
an
innocent
person
more
than
a
match
for
the
wily
as
dierich
was
going
out
kate
made
him
a
signal
she
would
speak
with
him
privately
he
bade
his
men
go
on
and
waited
outside
the
door
she
joined
him
hush
said
she
my
mother
knows
not
gerard
has
left
how
i
saw
him
last
ay
where
cried
dierich
eagerly
at
the
foot
of
the
haunted
how
did
he
get
the
rope
i
know
not
but
this
i
know
my
brother
gerard
bade
me
there
farewell
and
he
is
many
leagues
from
tergou
ere
this
the
town
you
know
was
always
unworthy
of
him
and
when
it
imprisoned
him
he
vowed
never
to
set
foot
in
it
again
let
the
burgomaster
be
content
then
he
has
imprisoned
him
and
he
has
driven
him
from
his
birthplace
and
from
his
native
land
what
need
now
to
rob
him
and
us
of
our
good
name
this
might
at
another
moment
have
struck
dierich
as
good
sense
but
he
was
too
mortified
at
this
escape
of
gerard
and
the
loss
of
a
hundred
crowns
what
need
had
he
to
steal
retorted
he
bitterly
gerard
stole
not
the
trash
he
but
took
it
to
spite
the
burgomaster
who
stole
his
liberty
but
he
shall
answer
to
the
duke
for
it
he
shall
as
for
these
skins
of
parchment
you
keep
such
a
coil
about
look
in
the
nearest
brook
or
stye
and
is
odds
but
you
find
think
ye
so
mistress
think
ye
so
and
dierich
eyes
flashed
mayhap
you
know
is
this
i
know
that
gerard
is
too
good
to
steal
and
too
wise
to
load
himself
with
rubbish
going
a
give
you
good
day
then
said
dierich
sharply
the
sheepskin
you
scorn
i
value
it
more
than
the
skin
of
any
in
and
he
went
off
hastily
on
a
false
scent
kate
returned
into
the
house
and
drew
giles
aside
giles
my
heart
misgives
me
breathe
not
to
a
soul
what
i
say
to
you
i
have
told
dirk
brower
that
gerard
is
out
of
holland
but
much
i
doubt
he
is
not
a
league
from
why
where
is
he
then
where
should
he
be
but
with
her
he
loves
but
if
so
he
must
not
loiter
these
be
deep
and
dark
and
wicked
men
that
seek
him
giles
i
see
that
in
dirk
brower
eye
makes
me
tremble
oh
why
can
not
i
fly
to
sevenbergen
and
bid
him
away
why
am
i
not
lusty
and
active
like
other
girls
god
forgive
me
for
fretting
at
his
will
but
i
never
felt
till
now
what
it
is
to
be
lame
and
weak
and
useless
but
you
are
strong
dear
giles
added
she
coaxingly
you
are
very
yes
i
am
strong
thundered
perpusillus
then
catching
sight
of
her
meaning
but
i
hate
to
go
on
foot
he
added
sulkily
alas
alas
who
will
help
me
if
you
will
not
dear
giles
do
you
not
love
gerard
yes
i
like
him
best
of
the
lot
i
go
to
sevenbergen
on
peter
buyskens
his
mule
ask
you
him
for
he
wo
lend
her
kate
remonstrated
the
whole
town
would
follow
him
it
would
be
known
whither
he
was
gone
and
gerard
be
in
worse
danger
than
before
giles
parried
this
by
promising
to
ride
out
of
the
town
the
opposite
way
and
not
turn
the
mule
head
towards
sevenbergen
till
he
had
got
rid
of
the
curious
kate
then
assented
and
borrowed
the
mule
she
charged
giles
with
a
short
but
meaning
message
and
made
him
repeat
it
after
her
over
and
over
till
he
could
say
it
word
for
word
giles
started
on
the
mule
and
little
kate
retired
and
did
the
last
thing
now
in
her
power
for
her
beloved
brother
prayed
on
her
knees
long
and
earnestly
for
his
safety
chapter
xiii
gerard
and
margaret
went
gaily
to
sevenbergen
in
the
first
flush
of
recovered
liberty
and
successful
adventure
but
these
soon
yielded
to
sadder
thoughts
gerard
was
an
escaped
prisoner
and
liable
to
be
retaken
and
perhaps
punished
and
therefore
he
and
margaret
would
have
to
part
for
a
time
moreover
he
had
conceived
a
hatred
to
his
native
place
margaret
wished
him
to
leave
the
country
for
a
while
but
at
the
thought
of
his
going
to
italy
her
heart
fainted
gerard
on
the
contrary
was
reconciled
to
leaving
margaret
only
by
his
desire
to
visit
italy
and
his
strong
conviction
that
there
he
should
earn
money
and
reputation
and
remove
every
obstacle
to
their
marriage
he
had
already
told
her
all
that
the
demoiselle
van
eyck
had
said
to
him
he
repeated
it
and
reminded
margaret
that
the
gold
pieces
were
only
given
him
to
go
to
italy
with
the
journey
was
clearly
for
gerard
interest
he
was
a
craftsman
and
an
artist
lost
in
this
boorish
place
in
italy
they
would
know
how
to
value
him
on
this
ground
above
all
the
unselfish
girl
gave
her
consent
but
many
tender
tears
came
with
it
and
at
that
gerard
young
and
loving
as
herself
cried
bitterly
with
her
and
often
they
asked
one
another
what
they
had
done
that
so
many
different
persons
should
be
their
enemies
and
combine
as
it
seemed
to
part
them
they
sat
hand
in
hand
till
midnight
now
deploring
their
hard
fate
now
drawing
bright
and
hopeful
pictures
of
the
future
in
the
midst
of
which
margaret
tears
would
suddenly
flow
and
then
poor
gerard
eloquence
would
die
away
in
a
sigh
the
morning
found
them
resigned
to
part
but
neither
had
the
courage
to
say
when
and
much
i
doubt
whether
the
hour
of
parting
ever
would
have
struck
but
about
three
in
the
afternoon
giles
who
had
made
a
circuit
of
many
miles
to
avoid
suspicion
rode
up
to
the
door
they
both
ran
out
to
him
eager
with
curiosity
brother
gerard
cried
he
in
his
tremendous
tones
kate
bids
you
run
for
your
life
they
charge
you
with
theft
you
have
given
them
a
handle
think
not
to
explain
hope
not
for
justice
in
tergou
the
parchments
you
took
they
are
but
a
blind
she
hath
seen
your
death
in
the
men
eyes
a
price
is
on
your
head
fly
for
margaret
sake
and
all
who
love
you
loiter
not
life
away
but
fly
it
was
a
and
left
two
white
faces
looking
at
one
another
and
at
the
terrible
messenger
then
giles
who
had
hitherto
but
uttered
by
rote
what
catherine
bade
him
put
in
a
word
of
his
own
all
the
constables
were
at
our
house
after
you
and
so
was
dirk
brower
kate
is
wise
gerard
best
give
ear
to
her
rede
and
fly
oh
yes
gerard
cried
margaret
wildly
fly
on
the
instant
ah
those
parchments
my
mind
misgave
me
why
did
i
let
you
take
them
margaret
they
are
but
a
blind
giles
says
so
no
matter
the
old
caitiff
shall
never
see
them
again
i
will
not
go
till
i
have
hidden
his
treasure
where
he
shall
never
find
gerard
then
after
thanking
giles
warmly
bade
him
farewell
and
told
him
to
go
back
and
tell
kate
he
was
gone
for
i
shall
be
gone
ere
you
reach
home
said
he
he
then
shouted
for
martin
and
told
him
what
had
happened
and
begged
him
to
go
a
little
way
towards
tergou
and
watch
the
road
ay
said
martin
and
if
i
see
dirk
brower
or
any
of
his
men
i
will
shoot
an
arrow
into
the
that
is
in
our
garden
and
on
that
you
must
run
into
the
forest
hard
by
and
meet
me
at
the
weird
spring
then
i
will
guide
you
through
the
surprise
thus
provided
against
gerard
breathed
again
he
went
with
margaret
and
while
she
watched
the
tremblingly
fearing
every
moment
to
see
an
arrow
strike
among
the
branches
gerard
dug
a
deep
hole
to
bury
the
parchments
in
he
threw
them
in
one
by
one
they
were
nearly
all
charters
and
records
of
the
burgh
but
one
appeared
to
be
a
private
deed
between
floris
brandt
father
of
peter
and
ghysbrecht
why
this
is
as
much
yours
as
his
said
gerard
i
will
read
oh
not
now
gerard
not
now
cried
margaret
every
moment
you
lose
fills
me
with
fear
and
see
large
drops
of
rain
are
beginning
to
fall
and
the
clouds
gerard
yielded
to
this
remonstrance
but
he
put
the
deed
into
his
bosom
and
threw
the
earth
in
over
the
others
and
stamped
it
down
while
thus
employed
there
came
a
flash
of
lightning
followed
by
a
peal
of
distant
thunder
and
the
rain
came
down
heavily
margaret
and
gerard
ran
into
the
house
whither
they
were
speedily
followed
by
martin
the
road
is
clear
said
he
and
a
heavy
storm
coming
his
words
proved
true
the
thunder
came
nearer
and
nearer
till
it
crashed
overhead
the
flashes
followed
one
another
close
like
the
strokes
of
a
whip
and
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
margaret
hid
her
face
not
to
see
the
lightning
on
this
gerard
put
up
the
rough
shutter
and
lighted
a
candle
the
lovers
consulted
together
and
gerard
blessed
the
storm
that
gave
him
a
few
hours
more
with
margaret
the
sun
set
unperceived
and
still
the
thunder
pealed
and
the
lightning
flashed
and
the
rain
poured
supper
was
set
but
gerard
and
margaret
could
not
eat
the
thought
that
this
was
the
last
time
they
should
sup
together
choked
them
the
storm
lulled
a
little
peter
retired
to
rest
but
gerard
was
to
go
at
peep
of
day
and
neither
he
nor
margaret
could
afford
to
lose
an
hour
in
sleep
martin
sat
a
while
too
for
he
was
fitting
a
new
string
to
his
bow
a
matter
in
which
he
was
very
nice
the
lovers
murmured
their
sorrows
and
their
love
beside
him
suddenly
the
old
man
held
up
his
hand
to
them
to
be
silent
they
were
quiet
and
listened
and
heard
nothing
but
the
next
moment
a
footstep
crackled
faintly
upon
the
autumn
leaves
that
lay
strewn
in
the
garden
at
the
back
door
of
the
house
to
those
who
had
nothing
to
fear
such
a
step
would
have
said
nothing
but
to
those
who
had
enemies
it
was
terrible
for
it
was
a
foot
trying
to
be
noiseless
martin
fitted
an
arrow
to
his
string
and
hastily
blew
out
the
candle
at
this
moment
to
their
horror
they
heard
more
than
one
footstep
approach
the
other
door
of
the
cottage
not
quite
so
noiselessly
as
the
other
but
very
stealthily
and
then
a
dead
pause
their
blood
froze
in
their
veins
oh
kate
oh
kate
you
said
fly
on
the
and
margaret
moaned
and
wrung
her
hands
in
anguish
and
terror
and
wild
remorse
for
having
kept
gerard
hush
girl
said
martin
in
a
stern
whisper
a
heavy
knock
fell
on
the
door
and
on
the
hearts
within
chapter
xiv
as
if
this
had
been
a
concerted
signal
the
back
door
was
struck
as
rudely
the
next
instant
they
were
hemmed
in
but
at
these
alarming
sounds
margaret
seemed
to
recover
some
share
of
she
whispered
say
he
was
here
but
is
and
with
this
she
seized
gerard
and
almost
dragged
him
up
the
rude
steps
that
led
to
her
her
own
lay
next
beyond
it
the
blows
on
the
door
were
repeated
who
knocks
at
this
hour
open
and
you
will
see
i
open
not
to
thieves
honest
men
are
all
abed
open
to
the
law
martin
wittenhaagen
or
you
shall
rue
why
that
is
dirk
brower
voice
i
trow
what
make
you
so
far
from
tergou
open
and
you
will
martin
drew
the
bolt
very
slowly
and
in
rushed
dierich
and
four
more
they
let
in
their
companion
who
was
at
the
back
door
now
martin
where
is
gerard
eliassoen
gerard
eliassoen
why
he
was
here
but
now
was
here
dierich
countenance
fell
and
where
is
he
now
they
say
he
has
gone
to
italy
why
what
is
to
do
no
matter
when
did
he
go
tell
me
not
that
he
went
in
such
a
storm
as
this
here
is
a
coil
about
gerard
eliassoen
said
martin
contemptuously
then
he
lighted
the
candle
and
seating
himself
coolly
by
the
fire
proceeded
to
whip
some
fine
silk
round
his
at
the
place
where
the
nick
of
the
arrow
frets
it
i
tell
you
said
he
carelessly
know
you
his
brother
giles
a
little
misbegotten
imp
all
head
and
arms
well
he
came
tearing
over
here
on
a
mule
and
bawled
out
something
i
was
too
far
off
to
hear
the
creature
words
but
only
its
noise
any
way
he
started
gerard
for
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
there
was
such
crying
and
kissing
and
then
gerard
went
away
they
do
tell
me
he
has
gone
to
italy
mayhap
you
know
where
that
is
for
i
dierich
countenance
fell
lower
and
lower
at
this
account
there
was
no
flaw
in
it
a
cunninger
man
than
martin
would
perhaps
have
told
a
lie
too
many
and
raised
suspicion
but
martin
did
his
task
well
he
only
told
the
one
falsehood
he
was
bade
to
tell
and
of
his
own
head
invented
nothing
mates
said
dierich
i
doubt
he
speaks
sooth
i
told
the
burgomaster
how
be
he
met
the
dwarf
galloping
peter
buyskens
mule
from
sevenbergen
have
sent
that
imp
to
gerard
says
he
then
gerard
is
at
sevenbergen
master
says
i
too
late
now
we
should
have
thought
of
sevenbergen
before
instead
of
wasting
our
time
hunting
all
the
odd
corners
of
tergou
for
those
cursed
parchments
that
we
shall
never
find
till
we
find
the
man
that
took
if
he
was
at
sevenbergen
quoth
i
they
sent
the
dwarf
to
him
it
must
have
been
to
warn
him
we
are
after
him
he
is
leagues
away
by
now
quoth
confound
that
girl
she
has
outwitted
us
bearded
men
and
so
i
told
the
burgomaster
but
he
would
not
hear
reason
a
wet
jerkin
apiece
that
is
all
we
shall
get
mates
by
this
martin
grinned
coolly
in
dierich
face
however
added
the
latter
to
content
the
burgomaster
we
will
search
the
martin
turned
grave
directly
this
change
of
countenance
did
not
escape
dierich
he
reflected
a
moment
watch
outside
two
of
you
one
on
each
side
of
the
house
that
no
one
jump
from
the
upper
windows
the
rest
come
with
and
he
took
the
candle
and
mounted
the
stairs
followed
by
three
of
his
comrades
martin
was
left
alone
the
stout
soldier
hung
his
head
all
had
gone
so
well
at
first
and
now
this
fatal
turn
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
all
was
not
yet
lost
gerard
must
be
either
in
peter
room
or
margaret
they
were
not
so
very
high
from
the
ground
gerard
would
leap
out
dierich
had
left
a
man
below
but
what
then
for
half
a
minute
gerard
and
he
would
be
two
to
one
and
in
that
brief
space
what
might
not
be
done
martin
then
held
the
back
door
ajar
and
watched
the
light
shone
in
peter
room
curse
the
fool
said
he
is
he
going
to
let
them
take
him
like
a
girl
the
light
now
passed
into
margaret
bedroom
still
no
window
was
opened
had
gerard
intended
to
escape
that
way
he
would
not
have
waited
till
the
men
were
in
the
room
martin
saw
that
at
once
and
left
the
door
and
came
to
the
and
listened
he
began
to
think
gerard
must
have
escaped
by
the
window
while
all
the
men
were
in
the
house
the
longer
the
silence
continued
the
stronger
grew
this
conviction
but
it
was
suddenly
and
rudely
dissipated
faint
cries
issued
from
the
inner
bedroom
margaret
they
have
taken
him
groaned
martin
they
have
got
it
now
flashed
across
martin
mind
that
if
they
took
gerard
away
his
life
was
not
worth
a
button
and
that
if
evil
befell
him
heart
would
break
he
cast
his
eyes
wildly
round
like
some
savage
beast
seeking
an
escape
and
in
a
twinkling
formed
a
resolution
terribly
characteristic
of
those
iron
times
and
of
a
soldier
driven
to
bay
he
stepped
to
each
door
in
turn
and
imitating
dierich
brower
voice
said
sharply
watch
the
window
he
then
quietly
closed
and
bolted
both
doors
he
then
took
up
his
bow
and
six
arrows
one
he
fitted
to
his
string
the
others
he
put
into
his
quiver
his
knife
he
placed
upon
a
chair
behind
him
the
hilt
towards
him
and
there
he
waited
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
with
the
calm
determination
to
slay
those
four
men
or
be
slain
by
them
two
he
knew
he
could
dispose
of
by
his
arrows
ere
they
could
get
near
him
and
gerard
and
he
must
take
their
chance
with
the
remaining
pair
besides
he
had
seen
men
by
a
sudden
attack
of
this
sort
should
brower
and
his
men
hesitate
but
an
instant
before
closing
with
him
he
should
shoot
three
instead
of
two
and
then
the
odds
would
be
on
the
right
side
he
had
not
long
to
wait
the
heavy
steps
sounded
in
margaret
room
and
came
nearer
and
nearer
the
light
also
approached
and
voices
martin
heart
stout
as
it
was
beat
hard
to
hear
men
coming
thus
to
their
death
and
perhaps
to
his
more
likely
so
than
not
for
four
is
long
odds
in
a
battlefield
of
ten
feet
square
and
gerard
might
be
bound
perhaps
and
powerless
to
help
but
this
man
whom
we
have
seen
shake
in
his
shoes
at
a
never
wavered
in
this
awful
moment
of
real
danger
but
stood
there
his
body
all
braced
for
combat
and
his
eye
glowing
equally
ready
to
take
life
and
lose
it
desperate
game
to
win
which
was
exile
instant
and
for
life
and
to
lose
it
was
to
die
that
moment
upon
that
floor
he
stood
on
dierich
brower
and
his
men
found
peter
in
his
first
sleep
they
opened
his
cupboards
they
ran
their
knives
into
an
alligator
he
had
nailed
to
his
wall
they
looked
under
his
bed
it
was
a
large
room
and
apparently
full
of
but
they
found
no
gerard
then
they
went
on
to
margaret
room
and
the
very
sight
of
it
was
discouraging
it
was
small
and
bare
and
not
a
cupboard
in
it
there
was
however
a
large
fireplace
and
chimney
dierich
eye
fell
on
these
directly
here
they
found
the
beauty
of
sevenbergen
sleeping
on
an
old
chest
not
a
foot
high
and
no
attempt
made
to
cover
it
but
the
sheets
were
snowy
white
and
so
was
margaret
own
linen
and
there
she
lay
looking
like
a
lily
fallen
into
a
rut
presently
she
awoke
and
sat
up
in
the
bed
like
one
amazed
then
seeing
the
men
began
to
scream
faintly
and
pray
for
mercy
she
made
dierich
brower
ashamed
of
his
errand
here
is
a
said
he
a
little
confused
we
are
not
going
to
hurt
you
my
pretty
maid
lie
you
still
and
shut
your
eyes
and
think
of
your
while
i
look
up
this
chimney
to
see
if
master
gerard
is
gerard
in
my
room
why
not
they
say
that
you
and
he
cruel
you
know
they
have
driven
him
away
from
me
driven
him
from
his
native
place
this
is
a
blind
you
are
thieves
you
are
wicked
men
you
are
not
men
of
sevenbergen
or
you
would
know
margaret
brandt
better
than
to
look
for
her
lover
in
this
room
of
all
others
in
the
world
oh
brave
four
great
hulking
men
to
come
armed
to
the
teeth
to
insult
one
poor
honest
girl
the
women
that
live
in
your
own
houses
must
be
naught
or
you
would
respect
them
too
much
to
insult
a
girl
of
good
there
come
away
before
we
hear
worse
said
dierich
hastily
he
is
not
in
the
chimney
plaster
will
mend
what
a
cudgel
breaks
but
a
woman
tongue
is
a
dagger
and
a
girl
is
a
woman
with
her
mother
milk
still
in
and
he
beat
a
hasty
retreat
i
told
the
burgomaster
how
chapter
xv
where
is
the
woman
that
can
not
act
a
part
where
is
she
who
will
not
do
it
and
do
it
well
to
save
the
man
she
loves
nature
on
these
great
occasions
comes
to
the
aid
of
the
simplest
of
the
sex
and
teaches
her
to
throw
dust
in
solomon
eyes
the
men
had
no
sooner
retired
than
margaret
stepped
out
of
bed
and
opened
the
long
chest
on
which
she
had
been
lying
down
in
her
skirt
and
petticoat
and
stockings
and
nightdress
over
all
and
put
the
lid
and
all
against
the
wall
then
glided
to
the
door
and
listened
the
footsteps
died
away
through
her
father
room
and
down
the
stairs
now
in
that
chest
there
was
a
peculiarity
that
it
was
almost
impossible
for
a
stranger
to
detect
a
part
of
the
boarding
of
the
room
had
been
broken
and
gerard
being
applied
to
to
make
it
look
neater
and
being
short
of
materials
had
ingeniously
sawed
away
a
space
sufficient
just
to
admit
margaret
bed
and
with
the
materials
thus
acquired
he
had
repaired
the
whole
room
as
for
the
bed
or
chest
it
really
rested
on
the
rafters
a
foot
below
the
boards
consequently
it
was
full
two
feet
deep
though
it
looked
scarce
one
all
was
quiet
margaret
kneeled
and
gave
thanks
to
heaven
then
she
glided
from
the
door
and
leaned
over
the
chest
and
whispered
tenderly
gerard
gerard
did
not
reply
she
then
whispered
a
little
louder
gerard
all
is
safe
thank
heaven
you
may
rise
but
oh
be
cautious
gerard
made
no
reply
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
gerard
no
reply
oh
what
is
this
she
cried
and
her
hands
ran
wildly
over
his
face
and
his
bosom
she
took
him
by
the
shoulders
she
shook
him
she
lifted
him
but
he
escaped
from
her
trembling
hands
and
fell
back
not
like
a
man
but
like
a
body
a
great
dread
fell
on
her
the
lid
had
been
down
she
had
lain
upon
it
the
men
had
been
some
time
in
the
room
with
all
the
strength
of
frenzy
she
tore
him
out
of
the
chest
she
bore
him
in
her
arms
to
the
window
she
dashed
the
window
open
the
sweet
air
came
in
she
laid
him
in
it
and
in
the
moonlight
his
face
was
the
colour
of
ashes
his
body
was
all
limp
and
motionless
she
felt
his
heart
horror
it
was
as
still
as
the
rest
horror
of
horrors
she
had
stifled
him
with
her
own
body
the
mind
can
not
all
at
once
believe
so
great
and
sudden
and
strange
a
calamity
gerard
who
had
got
alive
into
that
chest
scarce
five
minutes
ago
how
could
he
be
dead
she
called
him
by
all
the
endearing
names
that
heart
could
think
or
tongue
could
frame
she
kissed
him
and
fondled
him
and
coaxed
him
and
implored
him
to
speak
to
her
no
answer
to
words
of
love
such
as
she
had
never
uttered
to
him
before
nor
thought
she
could
utter
then
the
poor
creature
trembling
all
over
began
to
say
over
that
ashy
face
little
foolish
things
that
were
at
once
terrible
and
pitiable
oh
gerard
i
am
very
sorry
you
are
dead
i
am
very
sorry
i
have
killed
you
forgive
me
for
not
letting
the
men
take
you
it
would
have
been
better
than
this
oh
gerard
i
am
very
very
sorry
for
what
i
have
then
she
began
suddenly
to
rave
no
no
such
things
ca
be
or
there
is
no
god
it
is
monstrous
how
can
my
gerard
be
dead
how
can
i
have
killed
my
gerard
i
love
him
oh
god
you
know
how
i
love
him
he
does
not
i
never
told
him
if
he
knew
my
heart
he
would
speak
to
me
he
would
not
be
so
deaf
to
his
poor
margaret
it
is
all
a
trick
to
make
me
cry
out
and
betray
him
but
no
i
love
him
too
well
for
that
i
choke
and
she
seized
her
own
throat
to
check
her
wild
desire
to
scream
in
her
terror
and
anguish
if
he
would
but
say
one
word
oh
gerard
do
die
without
a
word
have
mercy
on
me
and
scold
me
but
speak
to
me
if
you
are
angry
with
me
scold
me
curse
me
i
deserve
it
the
idiot
that
killed
the
man
she
loved
better
than
herself
ah
i
am
a
murderess
the
worst
in
all
the
world
help
help
i
have
murdered
him
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
she
tore
her
hair
and
uttered
shriek
after
shriek
so
wild
so
piercing
they
fell
like
a
knell
upon
the
ears
of
dierich
brower
and
his
men
all
started
to
their
feet
and
looked
at
one
another
chapter

martin
wittenhaagen
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
with
his
arrow
drawn
nearly
to
the
head
and
his
knife
behind
him
was
struck
with
amazement
to
see
the
men
come
back
without
gerard
he
lowered
his
bow
and
looked
at
them
they
for
their
part
were
equally
puzzled
at
the
attitude
they
had
caught
him
in
why
mates
was
the
old
fellow
making
ready
to
shoot
at
us
stuff
said
martin
recovering
his
stolid
composure
i
was
but
trying
my
new
string
there
i
unstring
my
bow
if
you
think
humph
said
dierich
suspiciously
there
is
something
more
in
you
than
i
understand
put
a
log
on
and
let
us
dry
our
hides
a
bit
ere
we
a
blazing
fire
was
soon
made
and
the
men
gathered
round
it
and
their
clothes
and
long
hair
were
soon
smoking
from
the
cheerful
blaze
then
it
was
that
the
shrieks
were
heard
in
margaret
room
they
all
started
up
and
one
of
them
seized
the
candle
and
ran
up
the
steps
that
led
to
the
bedrooms
martin
rose
hastily
too
and
being
confused
by
these
sudden
screams
and
apprehending
danger
from
the
man
curiosity
tried
to
prevent
him
from
going
there
at
this
dierich
threw
his
arms
round
him
from
behind
and
called
on
the
others
to
keep
him
the
man
that
had
the
candle
got
clear
away
and
all
the
rest
fell
upon
martin
and
after
a
long
and
fierce
struggle
in
the
course
of
which
they
were
more
than
once
all
rolling
on
the
floor
with
martin
in
the
middle
they
succeeded
in
mastering
the
old
samson
and
binding
him
hand
and
foot
with
a
rope
they
had
brought
for
gerard
martin
groaned
aloud
he
saw
the
man
had
made
his
way
to
margaret
room
during
the
struggle
and
here
was
he
powerless
ay
grind
your
teeth
you
old
rogue
said
dierich
panting
with
the
struggle
you
sha
use
it
is
my
belief
mates
that
our
lives
were
scarce
safe
while
this
old
fellow
bones
were
he
makes
me
think
this
gerard
is
not
far
off
put
in
another
no

jorian
ketel
is
a
long
time
in
that

bedroom
best
go
and
see
after
him
some
of
the
rude
laugh
caused
by
this
remark
had
hardly
subsided
when
hasty
footsteps
were
heard
running
along
over
head
oh
here
he
comes
at
last
well
jorian
what
is
to
do
now
up
there
chapter
xvii
jorian
ketel
went
straight
to
margaret
room
and
there
to
his
infinite
surprise
he
found
the
man
he
had
been
in
search
of
pale
and
motionless
his
head
in
margaret
lap
and
she
kneeling
over
him
mute
now
and
stricken
to
stone
her
eyes
were
dilated
yet
glazed
and
she
neither
saw
the
light
nor
heard
the
man
nor
cared
for
anything
on
earth
but
the
white
face
in
her
lap
jorian
stood
the
candle
shaking
in
his
hand
why
where
was
he
then
all
the
time
margaret
heeded
him
not
jorian
went
to
the
empty
chest
and
inspected
it
he
began
to
comprehend
the
girl
dumb
and
frozen
despair
moved
him
this
is
a
sorry
sight
said
he
it
is
a
black
night
work
all
for
a
few
skins
better
have
gone
with
us
than
so
she
is
past
answering
me
poor
wench
stop
let
us
try
whether
he
took
down
a
little
round
mirror
no
bigger
than
his
hand
and
put
it
to
gerard
mouth
and
nostrils
and
held
it
there
when
he
withdrew
it
it
was
dull
there
is
life
in
him
said
jorian
ketel
to
himself
margaret
caught
the
words
instantly
though
only
muttered
and
it
was
if
a
statue
should
start
into
life
and
passion
she
rose
and
flung
her
arms
round
jorian
neck
oh
bless
the
tongue
that
tells
me
so
and
she
clasped
the
great
rough
fellow
again
and
again
eagerly
almost
fiercely
there
there
let
us
lay
him
warm
said
jorian
and
in
a
moment
he
raised
gerard
and
laid
him
on
the
then
he
took
out
a
flask
he
carried
and
filled
his
hand
twice
with
schiedamze
and
flung
it
sharply
each
time
in
gerard
face
the
pungent
liquor
with
his
recovery
he
gave
a
faint
sigh
oh
never
was
sound
so
joyful
to
human
ear
she
flew
towards
him
but
then
stopped
quivering
for
fear
she
should
hurt
him
she
had
lost
all
confidence
in
herself
that
is
right
let
him
alone
said
jorian
do
go
cuddling
him
as
you
did
me
or
you
drive
his
breath
back
again
let
him
alone
he
is
sure
to
come
to
is
like
as
if
he
was
an
old
gerard
sighed
deeply
and
a
faint
streak
of
colour
stole
to
his
lips
jorian
made
for
the
door
he
had
hardly
reached
it
when
he
found
his
legs
seized
from
behind
it
was
margaret
she
curled
round
his
knees
like
a
serpent
and
kissed
his
hand
and
fawned
on
him
you
wo
tell
you
have
saved
his
life
you
have
not
the
heart
to
thrust
him
back
into
his
grave
to
undo
your
own
good
work
no
no
it
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
done
you
two
a
good
turn
was
i
told
you
in
the
church
whither
we
had
to
take
him
besides
what
is
dierich
brower
to
me
i
see
him
hanged
ere
i
tell
him
but
i
wish
you
tell
me
where
the
parchments
are
there
are
a
hundred
crowns
offered
for
them
that
would
be
a
good
windfall
for
my
joan
and
the
children
you
ah
they
shall
have
those
hundred
crowns
what
are
the
things
in
the
house
asked
jorian
eagerly
no
but
i
know
where
they
are
and
by
god
and
bavon
i
swear
you
shall
have
them
come
to
me
for
them
when
you
will
but
come
i
were
made
else
what
share
the
hundred
crowns
with
dirk
brower
and
now
may
my
bones
rot
in
my
skin
if
i
let
a
soul
know
the
poor
boy
is
he
then
ran
off
lest
by
staying
longer
he
should
excite
suspicion
and
have
them
all
after
him
and
margaret
knelt
quivering
from
head
to
foot
and
prayed
beside
gerard
and
for
gerard
what
is
to
do
replied
jorian
to
dierich
brower
query
why
we
have
scared
the
girl
out
of
her
wits
she
was
in
a
kind
of
we
had
better
all
go
and
doctor
her
oh
yes
and
frighten
her
into
the
churchyard
her
father
is
a
doctor
and
i
have
roused
him
and
set
him
to
bring
her
round
let
us
see
the
fire
will
ye
his
way
disarmed
all
suspicion
and
soon
after
the
party
agreed
that
the
kitchen
of
the
three
kings
was
much
warmer
than
house
and
they
departed
having
first
untied
martin
take
note
mate
that
i
was
right
and
the
burgomaster
wrong
said
dierich
brower
at
the
door
i
said
we
should
be
too
late
to
catch
him
and
we
were
too
thus
gerard
in
one
terrible
night
grazed
the
prison
and
the
grave
and
how
did
he
get
clear
at
last
not
by
his
cunningly
contrived
nor
by
margaret
ready
wit
but
by
a
good
impulse
in
one
of
his
captors
by
the
bit
of
humanity
left
in
a
somewhat
reckless
fellow
heart
aided
by
his
desire
of
gain
so
mixed
and
seemingly
incongruous
are
human
motives
so
shortsighted
our
shrewdest
counsels
they
whose
moderate
natures
or
gentle
fates
keep
them
in
passage
from
the
fierce
extremes
of
joy
and
anguish
our
nature
is
capable
of
are
perhaps
the
best
and
certainly
the
happiest
of
mankind
but
to
such
readers
i
should
try
in
vain
to
convey
what
bliss
unspeakable
settled
now
upon
these
persecuted
lovers
even
to
those
who
have
joyed
greatly
and
greatly
suffered
my
feeble
art
can
present
but
a
pale
reflection
of
margaret
and
gerard
ecstasy
to
sit
and
see
a
beloved
face
come
back
from
the
grave
to
the
world
to
health
and
beauty
by
swift
gradations
to
see
the
roses
return
to
the
loved
cheek
love
glance
to
the
loved
eye
and
his
words
to
the
loved
mouth
this
was
margaret
a
joy
to
balance
years
of
sorrow
it
was
gerard
to
awake
from
a
trance
and
find
his
head
pillowed
on
margaret
arm
to
hear
the
woman
he
adored
murmur
new
words
of
eloquent
love
and
shower
tears
and
tender
kisses
and
caresses
on
him
he
never
knew
till
this
sweet
moment
how
ardently
how
tenderly
she
loved
him
he
thanked
his
enemies
they
wreathed
their
arms
sweetly
round
each
other
and
trouble
and
danger
seemed
a
world
an
age
behind
them
they
called
each
other
husband
and
wife
were
they
not
solemnly
betrothed
and
had
they
not
stood
before
the
altar
together
was
not
the
blessing
of
holy
church
upon
their
union
her
curse
on
all
who
would
part
them
but
as
no
woman
nerves
can
bear
with
impunity
so
terrible
a
strain
presently
margaret
turned
faint
and
sank
on
gerard
shoulder
smiling
feebly
but
quite
quite
unstrung
then
gerard
was
anxious
and
would
seek
assistance
but
she
held
him
with
a
gentle
grasp
and
implored
him
not
to
leave
her
for
a
moment
while
i
can
lay
my
hand
on
you
i
feel
you
are
safe
not
else
foolish
gerard
nothing
ails
me
i
am
weak
dearest
but
happy
oh
so
happy
then
it
was
gerard
turn
to
support
that
dear
head
with
its
great
waves
of
hair
flowing
loose
over
him
and
nurse
her
and
soothe
her
quivering
on
his
bosom
with
soft
encouraging
words
and
murmurs
of
love
and
gentle
caresses
sweetest
of
all
her
charms
is
a
woman
weakness
to
a
manly
heart
poor
things
they
were
happy
they
must
part
but
that
was
nothing
to
them
now
they
had
seen
death
and
all
other
troubles
seemed
light
as
air
while
there
is
life
there
is
hope
while
there
is
hope
there
is
joy
separation
for
a
year
or
two
what
was
it
to
them
who
were
so
young
and
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
grave
the
future
was
bright
the
present
was
heaven
so
passed
the
blissful
hours
alas
their
innocence
ran
other
risks
besides
the
prison
and
the
grave
they
were
in
most
danger
from
their
own
hearts
and
their
inexperience
now
that
visible
danger
there
was
none

went
upstairs
and
then
suddenly
one
of

gave

shout
and
pointed
through

the
others
looked
and
there
at

walking
quietly
across

descended
the
stairs
and
flung
himself
on
his
mule
and
he
and
his
men
set
off
in
hot
pursuit
chapter
xix
gerard
warned
by
recent
peril
rose
before
daybreak
and
waked
martin
the
old
soldier
was
astonished
he
thought
gerard
had
escaped
by
the
window
last
night
being
consulted
as
to
the
best
way
for
him
to
leave
the
country
and
elude
pursuit
he
said
there
was
but
one
road
safe
i
must
guide
you
through
the
great
forest
to
a
i
know
of
this
will
take
you
speedily
to
a
hostelry
where
they
will
lend
you
a
swift
horse
and
then
a
day
gallop
will
take
you
out
of
holland
but
let
us
start
ere
the
folk
here
quit
their
peter
house
was
but
a
furlong
and
a
half
from
the
forest
they
started
martin
with
his
bow
and
three
arrows
for
it
was
thursday
gerard
with
nothing
but
a
stout
oak
staff
peter
gave
him
for
the
journey
margaret
pinned
up
her
kirtle
and
farthingale
for
the
road
was
wet
peter
went
as
far
as
his
garden
hedge
with
them
and
then
with
more
emotion
than
he
often
bestowed
on
passing
events
gave
the
young
man
his
blessing
the
sun
was
peeping
above
the
horizon
as
they
crossed
the
stony
field
and
made
for
the
wood
they
had
crossed
about
half
when
margaret
who
kept
nervously
looking
back
every
now
and
then
uttered
a
cry
and
following
her
instinct
began
to
run
towards
the
wood
screaming
with
terror
all
the
way
ghysbrecht
and
his
men
were
in
hot
pursuit
resistance
would
have
been
madness
martin
and
gerard
followed
margaret
example
the
pursuers
gained
slightly
on
them
but
martin
kept
shouting
only
win
the
wood
only
win
the
wood
they
had
too
good
a
start
for
the
men
on
foot
and
their
hearts
bounded
with
hope
at
martin
words
for
the
great
trees
seemed
now
to
stretch
their
branches
like
friendly
arms
towards
them
and
their
leaves
like
a
screen
but
an
unforeseen
danger
attacked
them
the
fiery
old
burgomaster
flung
himself
on
his
mule
and
spurring
him
to
a
gallop
he
headed
not
his
own
men
only
but
the
fugitives
his
object
was
to
cut
them
off
the
old
man
came
galloping
in
a
semicircle
and
got
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
right
in
front
of
gerard
the
others
might
escape
for
aught
he
cared
margaret
shrieked
and
tried
to
protect
gerard
by
clasping
him
but
he
shook
her
off
without
ceremony
ghysbrecht
in
his
ardour
forgot
that
hunted
animals
turn
on
the
hunter
and
that
two
men
can
hate
and
two
can
long
to
kill
the
thing
they
hate
instead
of
attempting
to
dodge
him
as
the
burgomaster
made
sure
he
would
gerard
flew
right
at
him
with
a
savage
exulting
cry
and
struck
at
him
with
all
his
heart
and
soul
and
strength
the
oak
staff
came
down
on
ghysbrecht
face
with
a
frightful
crash
and
laid
him
under
his
mule
tail
beating
the
devil
tattoo
with
his
heels
his
face
streaming
and
his
collar
spattered
with
blood
the
next
moment
the
three
were
in
the
wood
the
yell
of
dismay
and
vengeance
that
burst
from
ghysbrecht
men
at
that
terrible
blow
which
felled
their
leader
told
the
fugitives
that
it
was
now
a
race
for
life
or
death
why
run
cried
gerard
panting
you
have
your
bow
and
i
have
this
and
he
shook
his
bloody
staff
boy
roared
martin
the
gallows
follow
me
and
he
fled
into
the
wood
soon
they
heard
a
cry
like
a
pack
of
hounds
opening
on
sight
of
the
game
the
men
were
in
the
wood
and
saw
them
flitting
amongst
the
trees
margaret
moaned
and
panted
as
she
ran
and
gerard
clenched
his
teeth
and
grasped
his
staff
the
next
minute
they
came
to
a
stiff
hazel
coppice
martin
dashed
into
it
and
shouldered
the
young
wood
aside
as
if
it
were
standing
corn
ere
they
had
gone
fifty
yards
in
it
they
came
to
four
blind
paths
martin
took
one
bend
low
said
he
and
half
creeping
they
glided
along
presently
their
path
was
again
intersected
with
other
little
tortuous
paths
they
took
one
of
them
it
seemed
to
lead
back
but
it
soon
took
a
turn
and
after
a
while
brought
them
to
a
thick
pine
grove
where
the
walking
was
good
and
hard
there
were
no
paths
here
and
the
young
were
so
thick
you
could
not
see
three
yards
before
your
nose
when
they
had
gone
some
way
in
this
martin
sat
down
and
having
learned
in
war
to
lose
all
impression
of
danger
with
the
danger
itself
took
a
piece
of
bread
and
a
slice
of
ham
out
of
his
wallet
and
began
quietly
to
eat
his
breakfast
the
young
ones
looked
at
him
with
dismay
he
replied
to
their
looks
all
sevenbergen
could
not
find
you
now
you
will
lose
your
purse
gerard
long
before
you
get
to
italy
is
that
the
way
to
carry
a
purse
gerard
looked
and
there
was
a
large
triangular
purse
entangled
by
its
chains
to
the
buckle
and
strap
of
his
wallet
this
is
none
of
mine
said
he
what
is
in
it
i
wonder
and
he
tried
to
detach
it
but
in
passing
through
the
coppice
it
had
become
inextricably
entangled
in
his
strap
and
buckle
it
seems
loath
to
leave
me
said
gerard
and
he
had
to
cut
it
loose
with
his
knife
the
purse
on
examination
proved
to
be
well
provided
with
silver
coins
of
all
sizes
but
its
bloated
appearance
was
greatly
owing
to
a
number
of
pieces
of
brown
paper
folded
and
doubled
a
light
burst
on
gerard
why
it
must
be
that
old
thief
and
see
stuffed
with
paper
to
deceive
the
world
the
wonder
was
how
the
burgomaster
purse
came
on
gerard
they
hit
at
last
upon
the
right
solution
the
purse
must
have
been
at
ghysbrecht
and
gerard
rushing
at
his
enemy
had
unconsciously
torn
it
away
thus
felling
his
enemy
and
robbing
him
with
a
single
gesture
gerard
was
delighted
at
this
feat
but
margaret
was
uneasy
throw
it
away
gerard
or
let
martin
take
it
back
already
they
call
you
a
thief
i
can
not
bear
throw
it
away
give
it
him
back
not
a
stiver
this
is
spoil
lawfully
won
in
battle
from
an
enemy
is
it
not
martin
why
of
course
send
him
back
the
brown
paper
and
you
will
but
the
purse
or
the
coin
that
were
a
oh
gerard
said
margaret
you
are
going
to
a
distant
land
we
need
the
goodwill
of
heaven
how
can
we
hope
for
that
if
we
take
what
is
not
ours
but
gerard
saw
it
in
a
different
light
it
is
heaven
that
gives
it
me
by
a
miracle
and
i
shall
cherish
it
accordingly
said
this
pious
youth
thus
the
favoured
people
spoiled
the
egyptians
and
were
take
your
own
way
said
margaret
humbly
you
are
wiser
than
i
am
you
are
my
husband
added
she
in
a
low
murmuring
voice
is
it
for
me
to
gainsay
you
these
humble
words
from
margaret
who
till
that
day
had
held
the
rather
surprised
martin
for
the
moment
they
recurred
to
him
some
time
afterwards
and
then
they
surprised
him
less
gerard
kissed
her
tenderly
in
return
for
her
docility
and
they
pursued
their
journey
hand
in
hand
martin
leading
the
way
into
the
depths
of
the
huge
forest
the
farther
they
went
the
more
absolutely
secure
from
pursuit
they
felt
indeed
the
townspeople
never
ventured
so
far
as
this
into
the
trackless
part
of
the
forest
impetuous
natures
repent
quickly
gerard
was
no
sooner
out
of
all
danger
than
his
conscience
began
to
prick
him
martin
would
i
had
not
struck
quite
so
whom
oh
let
that
pass
he
is
cheap
martin
i
saw
his
grey
hairs
as
my
stick
fell
on
him
i
doubt
they
will
not
from
my
sight
this
martin
grunted
with
contempt
who
spares
a
badger
for
his
grey
hairs
the
greyer
your
enemy
is
the
older
and
the
older
the
craftier
and
the
craftier
the
better
for
a
little
killing
killing
martin
speak
not
of
killing
and
gerard
shook
all
over
i
am
much
mistook
if
you
have
not
said
martin
cheerfully
now
heaven
forbid
the
old
vagabond
skull
cracked
like
a
walnut
aha
heaven
and
the
saints
forbid
it
he
rolled
off
his
mule
like
a
stone
shot
out
of
a
cart
said
i
to
myself
is
one
wiped
out
and
the
iron
old
soldier
grinned
ruthlessly
gerard
fell
on
his
knees
and
began
to
pray
for
his
enemy
life
at
this
martin
lost
his
patience
here
mummery
what
you
that
set
up
for
learning
know
you
not
that
a
wise
man
never
strikes
his
enemy
but
to
kill
him
and
what
is
all
this
coil
about
killing
of
old
men
if
it
had
been
a
young
one
now
with
the
joys
of
life
waiting
for
him
wine
women
and
pillage
but
an
old
fellow
at
the
edge
of
the
grave
why
not
shove
him
in
go
he
must
or
and
what
better
place
for
greybeards
now
if
ever
i
should
be
so
mischancy
as
to
last
so
long
as
ghysbrecht
did
and
have
to
go
on
a
mule
legs
instead
of
martin
wittenhaagen
and
a
back
like
this
striking
the
wood
of
his
bow
instead
of
this
striking
the
string
i
thank
and
bless
any
young
fellow
who
will
knock
me
on
the
head
as
you
have
done
that
old
shopkeeper
malison
on
his
memory
oh
culpa
mea
culpa
mea
cried
gerard
and
smote
upon
his
breast
look
there
cried
martin
to
margaret
scornfully
he
is
a
priest
at
heart
still
and
when
he
is
not
in
ire
paul
what
a
milksop
tush
martin
cried
margaret
reproachfully
then
she
wreathed
her
arms
round
gerard
and
comforted
him
with
the
double
magic
of
a
woman
sense
and
a
woman
voice
sweetheart
murmured
she
you
forget
you
went
not
a
step
out
of
the
way
to
harm
him
who
hunted
you
to
your
death
you
fled
from
him
he
it
was
who
spurred
on
you
then
did
you
strike
but
in
and
a
single
blow
and
with
that
which
was
in
your
hand
malice
had
drawn
knife
or
struck
again
and
again
how
often
have
men
been
smitten
with
staves
not
one
but
many
blows
yet
no
lives
lost
if
then
your
enemy
has
fallen
it
is
through
his
own
malice
not
yours
and
by
the
will
of
bless
you
margaret
bless
you
for
thinking
so
yes
but
beloved
one
if
you
have
had
the
misfortune
to
kill
that
wicked
man
the
more
need
is
there
that
you
fly
with
haste
from
holland
oh
let
us
nay
margaret
said
gerard
i
fear
not
man
vengeance
thanks
to
martin
here
and
this
thick
wood
only
him
i
fear
whose
eye
pierces
the
forest
and
reads
the
heart
of
man
if
i
but
struck
in
well
but
if
in
hate
he
may
bid
the
avenger
of
blood
follow
me
to
italy
to
italy
ay
to
earth
remotest
hush
said
martin
peevishly
i
ca
hear
for
your
what
is
it
do
you
hear
nothing
margaret
my
ears
are
getting
margaret
listened
and
presently
she
heard
a
tuneful
sound
like
a
single
stroke
upon
a
deep
ringing
bell
she
described
it
so
to
martin
nay
i
heard
it
said
he
and
so
did
i
said
gerard
it
was
beautiful
ah
there
it
is
again
how
sweetly
it
blends
with
the
air
it
is
a
long
way
off
it
is
before
us
is
it
not
no
no
the
echoes
of
this
wood
confound
the
ear
of
a
stranger
it
comes
from
the
pine
what
the
one
we
passed
why
martin
is
this
anything
you
look
wonderful
said
martin
with
a
sickly
sneer
he
asks
me
is
it
anything
come
on
on
at
any
rate
let
us
reach
a
better
place
than
a
better
place
for
what
to
stand
at
bay
gerard
said
martin
gravely
and
die
like
soldiers
killing
three
for
what
that
sound
it
is
the
avenger
of
oh
martin
save
him
oh
heaven
be
merciful
what
new
mysterious
peril
is
this
girl
it
a
chapter
xx
the
courage
like
the
talent
of
common
men
runs
in
a
narrow
groove
take
them
but
an
inch
out
of
that
and
they
are
done
martin
courage
was
perfect
as
far
as
it
went
he
had
met
and
baffled
many
dangers
in
the
course
of
his
rude
life
and
these
familiar
dangers
he
could
face
with
spartan
fortitude
almost
with
indifference
but
he
had
never
been
hunted
by
a
bloodhound
nor
had
he
ever
seen
that
brute
unerring
instinct
baffled
by
human
cunning
here
then
a
sense
of
the
supernatural
combined
with
novelty
to
ungenteel
his
heart
after
going
a
few
steps
he
leaned
on
his
bow
and
energy
and
hope
oozed
out
of
him
gerard
to
whom
the
danger
appeared
slight
in
proportion
as
it
was
distant
urged
him
to
flight
what
avails
it
said
martin
sadly
if
we
get
clear
of
the
wood
we
shall
die
cheap
here
hard
by
i
know
a
place
where
we
may
die
alas
good
martin
cried
gerard
despair
not
so
quickly
there
must
be
some
way
to
oh
martin
cried
margaret
what
if
we
were
to
part
company
life
alone
is
forfeit
is
there
no
way
to
draw
the
pursuit
on
us
twain
and
let
him
go
safe
girl
you
know
not
the
bloodhound
nature
he
is
not
on
this
track
or
that
he
is
on
the
track
of
blood
my
life
o
they
have
taken
him
to
where
ghysbrecht
fell
and
from
the
dead
man
blood
to
the
man
that
shed
it
that
cursed
hound
will
lead
them
though
gerard
should
run
through
an
army
or
swim
the
and
again
he
leaned
upon
his
bow
and
his
head
sank
the
hound
mellow
voice
rang
through
the
wood
a
cry
more
tunable
was
never
halloed
to
nor
cheered
with
horn
in
crete
in
sparta
or
in
thessaly
strange
that
things
beautiful
should
be
terrible
and
deadly
the
eye
of
the
while
fascinating
its
prey
is
lovely
no
royal
crown
holds
such
a
jewel
it
is
a
ruby
with
the
emerald
green
light
playing
ever
upon
it
yet
the
deer
that
sees
it
loses
all
power
of
motion
and
trembles
and
awaits
his
death
and
even
so
to
compare
hearing
with
sight
this
sweet
and
mellow
sound
seemed
to
fascinate
martin
wittenhaagen
he
stood
uncertain
bewildered
and
unnerved
gerard
was
little
better
now
martin
last
words
had
daunted
him
he
had
struck
an
old
man
and
shed
his
blood
and
by
means
of
that
very
blood
blood
avenger
was
on
his
track
was
not
the
finger
of
heaven
in
this
whilst
the
men
were
thus
benumbed
the
woman
brain
was
all
activity
the
man
she
loved
was
in
danger
lend
me
your
knife
said
she
to
martin
he
gave
it
her
but
be
little
use
in
your
hands
said
he
then
margaret
did
a
sly
thing
she
stepped
behind
gerard
and
furtively
drew
the
knife
across
her
arm
and
made
it
bleed
freely
then
stooping
smeared
her
hose
and
shoes
and
still
as
the
blood
trickled
she
smeared
them
but
so
adroitly
that
neither
gerard
nor
martin
saw
then
she
seized
the
soldier
arm
come
be
a
man
she
said
and
let
this
end
take
us
to
some
thick
place
where
numbers
will
not
avail
our
i
am
going
said
martin
sulkily
hurry
avails
not
we
can
not
shun
the
hound
and
the
place
is
hard
by
then
turning
to
the
left
he
led
the
way
as
men
go
to
execution
he
soon
brought
them
to
a
thick
hazel
coppice
like
the
one
that
had
favoured
their
escape
in
the
morning
there
said
he
this
is
but
a
furlong
broad
but
it
will
serve
our
what
are
we
to
do
get
through
this
and
wait
on
the
other
side
then
as
they
come
straggling
through
shoot
three
knock
two
on
the
head
and
the
rest
will
kill
is
that
all
you
can
think
of
said
gerard
that
is
then
martin
wittenhaagen
i
take
the
lead
for
you
have
lost
your
head
come
can
you
obey
so
young
a
man
as
i
am
oh
yes
martin
cried
margaret
do
not
gainsay
gerard
he
is
wiser
than
his
martin
yielded
a
sullen
assent
do
then
as
you
see
me
do
said
gerard
and
drawing
his
huge
knife
he
cut
at
every
step
a
hazel
shoot
or
two
close
by
the
ground
and
turning
round
twisted
them
behind
him
among
the
standing
shoots
martin
did
the
same
but
with
a
dogged
hopeless
air
when
they
had
thus
painfully
travelled
through
the
greater
part
of
the
coppice
the
bloodhound
deep
bay
came
nearer
and
nearer
less
and
less
musical
louder
and
sterner
margaret
trembled
martin
went
down
on
his
stomach
and
listened
i
hear
a
horse
no
said
gerard
i
doubt
it
is
a
mule
that
cursed
ghysbrecht
is
still
alive
none
other
would
follow
me
up
so
never
strike
your
enemy
but
to
slay
him
said
martin
gloomily
i
hit
harder
this
time
if
heaven
gives
me
the
chance
said
gerard
at
last
they
worked
through
the
coppice
and
there
was
an
open
wood
the
trees
were
large
but
far
apart
and
no
escape
possible
that
way
and
now
with
the
hound
bay
mingled
a
score
of
voices
hooping
and
hallooing
the
whole
village
is
out
after
us
said
martin
i
care
not
said
gerard
listen
martin
i
have
made
the
track
smooth
to
the
dog
but
rough
to
the
men
that
we
may
deal
with
them
apart
thus
the
hound
will
gain
on
the
men
and
as
soon
as
he
comes
out
of
the
coppice
we
must
kill
the
hound
there
are
more
than
i
hear
but
ay
but
one
speaks
the
others
run
mute
but
let
the
leading
hound
lose
the
scent
then
another
shall
give
tongue
there
will
be
two
dogs
at
least
or
devils
in
dog
then
we
must
kill
two
instead
of
one
the
moment
they
are
dead
into
the
coppice
again
and
go
right
that
is
a
good
thought
gerard
said
martin
plucking
up
heart
hush
the
men
are
in
the
gerard
now
gave
his
orders
in
a
whisper
stand
you
with
your
bow
by
the
side
of
the
coppice
there
in
the
ditch
i
will
go
but
a
few
yards
to
yon
and
hide
behind
it
the
dogs
will
follow
me
and
as
they
come
out
shoot
as
many
as
you
can
the
rest
will
i
brain
as
they
come
round
the
martin
eye
flashed
they
took
up
their
places
the
hooping
and
hallooing
came
closer
and
closer
and
soon
even
the
rustling
of
the
young
wood
was
heard
and
every
now
and
then
the
unerring
bloodhound
gave
a
single
bay
it
was
terrible
the
branches
rustling
nearer
and
nearer
and
the
inevitable
struggle
for
life
and
death
coming
on
minute
by
minute
and
that
leading
it
a
trembling
hand
was
laid
on
shoulder
it
made
him
start
violently
strung
up
as
he
was
martin
says
if
we
are
forced
to
part
company
make
for
that
high
we
came
in
yes
yes
yes
but
go
back
for
heaven
sake
do
come
here
all
out
in
the
open
she
ran
back
towards
martin
but
ere
she
could
get
to
him
suddenly
a
huge
dog
burst
out
of
the
coppice
and
stood
erect
a
moment
margaret
cowered
with
fear
but
he
never
noticed
her
scent
was
to
him
what
sight
is
to
us
he
lowered
his
nose
an
instant
and
the
next
moment
with
an
awful
yell
sprang
straight
at
gerard
tree
and
rolled
dead
as
a
stone
literally
spitted
with
an
arrow
from
the
bow
that
twanged
beside
the
coppice
in
martin
hand
that
same
moment
out
came
another
hound
and
smelt
his
dead
comrade
gerald
rushed
out
at
him
but
ere
he
could
use
his
cudgel
a
streak
of
white
lightning
seemed
to
strike
the
hound
and
he
grovelled
in
the
dust
wounded
desperately
but
not
killed
and
howling
piteously
gerard
had
not
time
to
despatch
him
the
coppice
rustled
too
near
it
seemed
alive
pointing
wildly
to
martin
to
go
back
gerard
ran
a
few
yards
to
the
right
then
crept
cautiously
into
the
thick
coppice
just
as
three
men
burst
out
these
had
headed
their
comrades
considerably
the
rest
were
following
at
various
distances
gerard
crawled
back
almost
on
instinct
taught
martin
and
margaret
to
do
the
same
upon
their
line
of
retreat
thus
within
the
distance
of
a
few
yards
the
pursuers
and
pursued
were
passing
one
another
upon
opposite
tracks
a
loud
cry
announced
the
discovery
of
the
dead
and
the
wounded
hound
then
followed
a
babble
of
voices
still
swelling
as
fresh
pursuers
reached
the
spot
the
hunters
as
usual
on
a
surprise
were
wasting
time
and
the
hunted
ones
were
making
the
most
of
it
i
hear
no
more
hounds
whispered
martin
to
margaret
and
he
was
himself
again
it
was
margaret
turn
to
tremble
and
despair
oh
why
did
we
part
with
gerard
they
will
kill
my
gerard
and
i
not
near
nay
nay
the
head
to
catch
him
is
not
on
their
shoulders
you
bade
him
meet
us
at
the
and
so
i
did
bless
you
martin
for
thinking
of
that
to
the
ay
but
with
less
they
were
now
nearly
at
the
edge
of
the
coppice
when
suddenly
they
heard
hooping
and
hallooing
behind
them
the
men
had
satisfied
themselves
the
fugitives
were
in
the
coppice
and
were
beating
back
no
matter
whispered
martin
to
his
trembling
companion
we
shall
have
time
to
win
clear
and
slip
back
out
of
sight
by
hard
running
ah
he
stooped
suddenly
for
just
as
he
was
going
to
burst
out
of
the
brushwood
his
eye
caught
a
figure
keeping
sentinel
it
was
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
seated
on
his
mule
a
bloody
bandage
was
across
his
nose
the
bridge
of
which
was
broken
but
over
this
his
eyes
peered
keenly
and
it
was
plain
by
their
expression
he
had
heard
the
fugitives
rustle
and
was
looking
out
for
them
martin
muttered
a
terrible
oath
and
cautiously
strung
his
bow
then
with
equal
caution
fitted
his
last
arrow
to
the
string
margaret
put
her
hands
to
her
face
but
said
nothing
she
saw
this
man
must
die
or
gerard
after
the
first
impulse
she
peered
through
her
fingers
her
heart
panting
to
her
throat
the
bow
was
raised
and
the
deadly
arrow
steadily
drawn
to
its
head
when
at
that
moment
an
active
figure
leaped
on
ghysbrecht
from
behind
so
swiftly
it
was
like
a
hawk
swooping
on
a
pigeon
a
kerchief
went
over
the
burgomaster
in
a
turn
of
the
hand
his
head
was
muffled
in
it
and
he
was
whirled
from
his
seat
and
fell
heavily
upon
the
ground
where
he
lay
groaning
with
terror
and
gerard
jumped
down
after
him
hist
martin
martin
martin
and
margaret
came
out
the
former
openmouthed
crying
now
fly
fly
while
they
are
all
in
the
thicket
we
are
at
this
crisis
when
safety
seemed
at
hand
as
fate
would
have
it
margaret
who
had
borne
up
so
bravely
till
now
began
to
succumb
partly
from
loss
of
blood
oh
my
beloved
fly
she
gasped
leave
me
for
i
am
no
no
cried
gerard
death
together
or
safety
ah
the
mule
mount
her
you
and
i
run
by
your
in
a
moment
martin
was
on
ghysbrecht
mule
and
gerard
raised
the
fainting
girl
in
his
arms
and
placed
her
on
the
saddle
and
relieved
martin
of
his
bow
help
treason

murder
shrieked
ghysbrecht
suddenly
rising
on
his
hams
silence
cur
roared
gerard
and
trode
him
down
again
by
the
throat
as
men
crush
an
adder
now
have
you
got
her
firm
then
fly
for
our
lives
for
our
lives
but
even
as
the
mule
urged
suddenly
by
martin
heel
scattered
the
flints
with
his
hind
hoofs
ere
he
got
into
a
canter
and
even
as
gerard
withdrew
his
foot
from
ghysbrecht
throat
to
run
dierich
brower
and
his
five
men
who
had
come
back
for
orders
and
heard
the
cries
burst
roaring
out
of
the
coppice
on
them
chapter
xxi
speech
is
the
familiar
vent
of
human
thoughts
but
there
are
emotions
so
simple
and
overpowering
that
they
rush
out
not
in
words
but
eloquent
sounds
at
such
moments
man
seems
to
lose
his
characteristics
and
to
be
merely
one
of
the
higher
animals
for
these
when
greatly
agitated
ejaculate
though
they
can
not
speak
there
was
something
terrible
and
truly
animal
both
in
the
roar
of
triumph
with
which
the
pursuers
burst
out
of
the
thicket
on
our
fugitives
and
the
sharp
cry
of
terror
with
which
these
latter
darted
away
the
pursuers
hands
clutched
the
empty
air
scarce
two
feet
behind
them
as
they
fled
for
life
confused
for
a
moment
like
lions
that
miss
their
spring
dierich
and
his
men
let
gerard
and
the
mule
put
ten
yards
between
them
then
they
flew
after
with
uplifted
weapons
they
were
sure
of
catching
them
for
this
was
not
the
first
time
the
parties
had
measured
speed
in
the
open
ground
they
had
gained
visibly
on
the
three
this
morning
and
now
at
last
it
was
a
fair
race
again
to
be
settled
by
speed
alone
a
hundred
yards
were
covered
in
no
time
yet
still
there
remained
these
ten
yards
between
the
pursuers
and
the
pursued
this
increase
of
speed
since
the
morning
puzzled
dierich
brower
the
reason
was
this
when
three
run
in
company
the
pace
is
that
of
the
slowest
of
the
three
from
peter
house
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
gerard
ran
margaret
pace
but
now
he
ran
his
own
for
the
mule
was
fleet
and
could
have
left
them
all
far
behind
moreover
youth
and
chaste
living
began
to
tell
daylight
grew
imperceptibly
between
the
hunted
ones
and
the
hunters
then
dierich
made
a
desperate
effort
and
gained
two
yards
but
in
a
few
seconds
gerard
had
stolen
them
quietly
back
the
pursuers
began
to
curse
martin
heard
and
his
face
lighted
up
courage
gerard
courage
brave
lad
they
are
it
was
so
dierich
was
now
headed
by
one
of
his
men
and
another
dropped
into
the
rear
altogether
they
came
to
a
rising
ground
not
sharp
but
long
and
here
youth
and
grit
and
sober
living
told
more
than
ever
ere
he
reached
the
top
dierich
forty
years
weighed
him
down
like
forty
bullets
our
cake
is
dough
he
gasped
take
him
dead
if
you
ca
alive
and
he
left
running
and
followed
at
a
foot
pace
jorian
ketel
tailed
off
next
and
then
another
and
so
one
by
one
gerard
ran
them
all
to
a
standstill
except
one
who
kept
on
stanch
as
a
bloodhound
though
losing
ground
every
minute
his
name
if
i
am
not
mistaken
was
eric
wouverman
followed
by
him
they
came
to
a
rise
in
the
wood
shorter
but
much
steeper
than
the
last
hand
on
mane
cried
martin
gerard
obeyed
and
the
mule
helped
him
up
the
hill
faster
even
than
he
was
running
before
at
the
sight
of
this
manoeuvre
dierich
man
lost
heart
and
being
now
full
eighty
yards
behind
gerard
and
rather
more
than
that
in
advance
of
his
nearest
comrade
he
pulled
up
short
and
in
obedience
to
order
took
down
his
crossbow
levelled
it
deliberately
and
just
as
the
trio
were
sinking
out
of
sight
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
sent
the
bolt
whizzing
among
them
there
was
a
cry
of
dismay
and
next
moment
as
if
a
had
fallen
on
them
they
were
all
lying
on
the
ground
mule
and
all
chapter
xxii
the
effect
was
so
sudden
and
magical
that
the
shooter
himself
was
stupefied
for
an
instant
then
he
hailed
his
companions
to
join
him
in
effecting
the
capture
and
himself
set
off
up
the
hill
but
ere
he
had
got
half
way
up
rose
the
figure
of
martin
wittenhaagen
with
a
bent
bow
in
his
hand
eric
wouverman
no
sooner
saw
him
in
this
attitude
than
he
darted
behind
a
tree
and
made
himself
as
small
as
possible
skill
with
that
weapon
was
well
known
and
the
slain
dog
was
a
keen
reminder
of
it
wouverman
peered
round
the
bark
cautiously
there
was
the
arrow
point
still
aimed
at
him
he
saw
it
shine
he
dared
not
move
from
his
shelter
when
he
had
been
at
some
minutes
his
companions
came
up
in
great
force
then
with
a
scornful
laugh
martin
vanished
and
presently
was
heard
to
ride
off
on
the
mule
all
the
men
ran
up
together
the
high
ground
commanded
a
view
of
a
narrow
but
almost
interminable
glade
they
saw
gerard
and
margaret
running
along
at
a
prodigious
distance
they
looked
like
gnats
and
martin
galloping
after
them
ventre
a
terre
the
hunters
were
outwitted
as
well
as
outrun
a
few
words
will
explain
martin
conduct
we
arrive
at
causes
by
noting
coincidences
yet
now
and
then
coincidences
are
deceitful
as
we
have
all
seen
a
hare
tumble
over
a
briar
just
as
the
gun
went
off
and
so
raise
expectations
then
dash
them
to
earth
by
scudding
away
untouched
so
the
burgomaster
mule
put
her
foot
in
a
at
or
about
the
time
the
crossbow
bolt
whizzed
innocuous
over
her
head
she
fell
and
threw
both
her
riders
gerard
caught
margaret
but
was
carried
down
by
her
weight
and
impetus
and
behold
the
soil
was
strewed
with
dramatis
personae
the
docile
mule
was
up
again
directly
and
stood
trembling
martin
was
next
and
looking
round
saw
there
was
but
one
in
pursuit
on
this
he
made
the
young
lovers
fly
on
foot
while
he
checked
the
enemy
as
i
have
recorded
he
now
galloped
after
his
companions
and
when
after
a
long
race
he
caught
them
he
instantly
put
gerard
and
margaret
on
the
mule
and
ran
by
their
side
till
his
breath
failed
then
took
his
turn
to
ride
and
so
in
rotation
thus
the
runner
was
always
fresh
and
long
ere
they
relaxed
their
speed
all
sound
and
trace
of
them
was
hopelessly
lost
to
dierich
and
his
men
these
latter
went
crestfallen
back
to
look
after
their
chief
and
their
winged
bloodhound

life
and
liberty
while
safe
are
little
thought
of
for
why
they
are
matters
of
course
endangered
they
are
rated
at
their
real
value
in
this
too
they
are
like
sunshine
whose
beauty
men
notice
not
at
noon
when
it
is
greatest
but
towards
evening
when
it
lies
in
flakes
of
topaz
under
shady
elms
yet
it
is
feebler
then
but
gloom
lies
beside
it
and
contrast
reveals
its
fire
thus
gerard
and
margaret
though
they
started
at
every
leaf
that
rustled
louder
than
its
fellows
glowed
all
over
with
joy
and
thankfulness
as
they
glided
among
the
friendly
trees
in
safety
and
deep
tranquil
silence
baying
dogs
and
brutal
voices
yet
ringing
in
their
mind
ears
but
presently
gerard
found
stains
of
blood
on
margaret
ankles
martin
martin
help
they
have
wounded
her
the
crossbow
no
no
said
margaret
smiling
to
reassure
him
i
am
not
wounded
nor
hurt
at
but
what
is
it
then
in
heaven
name
cried
gerard
in
great
agitation
scold
me
not
then
and
margaret
blushed
did
i
ever
scold
you
no
dear
gerard
well
then
martin
said
it
was
blood
those
cruel
dogs
followed
so
i
thought
if
i
could
but
have
a
little
blood
on
my
shoon
the
dogs
would
follow
me
instead
and
let
my
gerard
wend
free
so
i
scratched
my
arm
with
martin
knife
forgive
me
whose
else
could
i
take
yours
gerard
ah
no
you
forgive
me
said
she
beseechingly
and
lovingly
and
fawningly
all
in
one
let
me
see
this
scratch
first
said
gerard
choking
with
emotion
there
i
thought
so
a
scratch
i
call
it
a
cut
a
deep
terrible
cruel
gerard
shuddered
at
sight
of
it
she
might
have
done
it
with
her
bodkin
said
the
soldier
milksop
that
sickens
at
sight
of
a
scratch
and
a
little
no
no
i
could
look
on
a
sea
of
blood
but
not
on
hers
oh
margaret
how
could
you
be
so
cruel
margaret
smiled
with
love
ineffable
foolish
gerard
murmured
she
to
make
so
much
of
and
she
flung
the
guilty
arm
round
his
neck
as
if
i
would
not
give
all
the
blood
in
my
heart
for
you
let
alone
a
few
drops
from
my
and
with
this
under
the
sense
of
his
recent
danger
she
wept
on
his
neck
for
pity
and
love
and
he
wept
with
her
and
i
must
part
from
her
he
sobbed
we
two
that
love
so
dear
one
must
be
in
holland
one
in
italy
ah
me
ah
me
ah
me
at
this
margaret
wept
afresh
but
patiently
and
silently
instinct
is
never
off
its
guard
and
with
her
unselfishness
was
an
instinct
to
utter
her
present
thoughts
would
be
to
add
to
gerard
misery
at
parting
so
she
wept
in
silence
suddenly
they
emerged
upon
a
beaten
path
and
martin
stopped
this
is
the
i
spoke
of
said
he
hanging
his
head
and
there
away
lies
the
margaret
and
gerard
cast
a
scared
look
at
one
another
come
a
step
with
me
martin
whispered
gerard
when
he
had
drawn
him
aside
he
said
to
him
in
a
broken
voice
good
martin
watch
over
her
for
me
she
is
my
wife
yet
i
leave
her
see
martin
here
is
gold
it
was
for
my
journey
it
is
no
use
my
asking
her
to
take
it
she
would
not
but
you
will
for
her
will
you
not
oh
heaven
and
is
this
all
i
can
do
for
her
money
but
poverty
is
a
curse
you
will
not
let
her
want
for
anything
dear
martin
the
burgomaster
silver
is
enough
for
thou
art
a
good
lad
gerard
neither
want
nor
harm
shall
come
to
her
i
care
more
for
her
little
finger
than
for
all
the
world
and
were
she
nought
to
me
even
for
thy
sake
would
i
be
a
father
to
her
go
with
a
stout
heart
and
god
be
with
thee
going
and
and
the
rough
soldier
wrung
gerard
hand
and
turned
his
head
away
with
unwonted
feeling
after
a
moment
silence
he
was
for
going
back
to
margaret
but
gerard
stopped
him
no
good
martin
prithee
stay
here
behind
this
thicket
and
turn
your
head
away
from
us
while
martin
martin
by
this
means
gerard
escaped
a
witness
of
his
anguish
at
leaving
her
he
loved
and
martin
escaped
a
piteous
sight
he
did
not
see
the
poor
young
things
kneel
and
renew
before
heaven
those
holy
vows
cruel
men
had
interrupted
he
did
not
see
them
cling
together
like
one
and
then
try
to
part
and
fail
and
return
to
one
another
and
cling
again
like
drowning
despairing
creatures
but
he
heard
gerard
sob
and
sob
and
margaret
moan
at
last
there
was
a
hoarse
cry
and
feet
pattered
on
the
hard
road
he
started
up
and
there
was
gerard
running
wildly
with
both
hands
clasped
above
his
head
in
prayer
and
margaret
tottering
back
towards
him
with
palms
extended
piteously
as
if
for
help
and
ashy
cheek
and
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
spoke
words
of
comfort
to
her
but
her
mind
could
not
take
them
in
only
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
moaned
and
held
him
tight
and
trembled
violently
he
got
her
on
the
mule
and
put
his
arm
around
her
and
so
supporting
her
frame
which
from
being
strong
like
a
boy
had
now
turned
all
relaxed
and
powerless
he
took
her
slowly
and
sadly
home
she
did
not
shed
one
tear
nor
speak
one
word
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
he
took
her
off
the
mule
and
bade
her
go
across
to
her
father
house
she
did
as
she
was
bid
martin
to
rotterdam
sevenbergen
was
too
hot
for
him
gerard
severed
from
her
he
loved
went
like
one
in
a
dream
he
hired
a
horse
and
a
guide
at
the
little
hostelry
and
rode
swiftly
towards
the
german
frontier
but
all
was
mechanical
his
senses
felt
blunted
trees
and
houses
and
men
moved
by
him
like
objects
seen
through
a
veil
his
companions
spoke
to
him
twice
but
he
did
not
answer
only
once
he
cried
out
savagely
shall
we
never
be
out
of
this
hateful
country
after
many
hours
riding
they
came
to
the
brow
of
a
steep
hill
a
small
brook
ran
at
the
bottom
halt
cried
the
guide
and
pointed
across
the
valley
here
is
where
on
side
of
the
bourn
no
need
to
ride
down
the
hill
i
gerard
dismounted
without
a
word
and
took
the
burgomaster
purse
from
his
girdle
while
he
opened
it
you
will
soon
be
out
of
this
hateful
country
said
his
guide
half
sulkily
mayhap
the
one
you
are
going
to
will
like
you
no
better
any
way
though
it
be
a
church
you
have
robbed
they
can
not
take
you
once
across
that
these
words
at
another
time
would
have
earned
the
speaker
an
admonition
or
a
cuff
they
fell
on
gerard
now
like
idle
air
he
paid
the
lad
in
silence
and
descended
the
hill
alone
the
brook
was
silvery
it
ran
murmuring
over
little
pebbles
that
glittered
varnished
by
the
clear
water
he
sat
down
and
looked
stupidly
at
them
then
he
drank
of
the
brook
then
he
laved
his
hot
feet
and
hands
in
it
it
was
very
cold
it
waked
him
he
rose
and
taking
a
run
leaped
across
it
into
germany
even
as
he
touched
the
strange
land
he
turned
suddenly
and
looked
back
farewell
ungrateful
country
he
cried
but
for
her
it
would
cost
me
nought
to
leave
you
for
ever
and
all
my
kith
and
kin
and
the
mother
that
bore
me
and
my
playmates
and
my
little
native
town
farewell
fatherland
welcome
the
wide
world
omne
p
and
with
these
brave
words
in
his
mouth
he
drooped
suddenly
with
arms
and
legs
all
weak
and
sat
down
and
sobbed
bitterly
upon
the
foreign
soil
when
the
young
exile
had
sat
a
while
bowed
down
he
rose
and
dashed
the
tears
from
his
eyes
like
a
man
and
not
casting
a
single
glance
more
behind
him
to
weaken
his
heart
stepped
out
into
the
wide
world
his
love
and
heavy
sorrow
left
no
room
in
him
for
vulgar
misgivings
compared
with
rending
himself
from
margaret
it
seemed
a
small
thing
to
go
on
foot
to
italy
in
that
rude
age
all
nations
meet
in
a
convent
so
thanks
to
his
good
friends
the
monks
and
his
own
thirst
of
knowledge
he
could
speak
most
of
the
languages
needed
on
that
long
road
he
said
to
himself
i
will
soon
be
at
rome
the
sooner
the
better
after
walking
a
good
league
he
came
to
a
place
where
four
ways
met
being
country
roads
and
serpentine
they
had
puzzled
many
an
inexperienced
neighbour
passing
from
village
to
village
gerard
took
out
a
little
dial
peter
had
given
him
and
set
it
in
the
autumn
sun
and
by
this
compass
steered
unhesitatingly
for
rome
inexperienced
as
a
young
swallow
flying
south
but
unlike
the
swallow
wandering
south
alone
chapter
xxiv
not
far
on
this
road
he
came
upon
a
little
group
two
men
in
sober
suits
stood
leaning
lazily
on
each
side
of
a
horse
talking
to
one
another
the
rider
in
a
silk
doublet
and
bright
green
jerkin
and
hose
both
of
english
cloth
glossy
as
a
mole
lay
flat
on
his
stomach
in
the
afternoon
sun
and
looked
an
enormous
lizard
his
velvet
cloak
flaming
yellow
was
carefully
spread
over
the
horse
loins
is
aught
amiss
inquired
gerard
not
that
i
wot
of
replied
one
of
the
servants
but
your
master
he
lies
like
a
corpse
are
ye
not
ashamed
to
let
him
grovel
on
the
ground
go
to
the
bare
ground
is
the
best
cure
for
his
disorder
if
you
get
sober
in
bed
it
gives
you
a
headache
but
you
leap
up
from
the
hard
ground
like
a
lark
in
spring
eh
ulric
he
speaks
sooth
young
man
said
ulric
warmly
what
is
the
gentleman
drunk
the
servants
burst
into
a
hoarse
laugh
at
the
simplicity
of
question
but
suddenly
ulric
stopped
and
eyeing
him
all
over
said
very
gravely
who
are
you
and
where
born
that
know
not
the
count
is
ever
drunk
at
this
hour
and
gerard
found
himself
a
suspected
character
i
am
a
stranger
said
he
but
a
true
man
and
one
that
loves
knowledge
therefore
ask
i
questions
and
not
for
love
of
if
you
be
a
true
man
said
ulric
shrewdly
then
give
us
trinkgeld
for
the
knowledge
we
have
given
gerard
looked
blank
but
putting
a
good
face
on
it
said
trinkgeld
you
shall
have
such
as
my
lean
purse
can
spare
an
if
you
will
tell
me
why
ye
have
his
cloak
from
the
man
and
laid
it
on
the
under
the
inspiring
influence
of
coming
trinkgeld
two
solutions
were
instantly
offered
gerard
at
once
the
one
was
that
should
the
count
come
to
himself
which
being
a
seasoned
toper
he
was
apt
to
do
all
in
a
minute
and
find
his
horse
standing
sweating
in
the
cold
while
a
cloak
lay
idle
at
hand
he
would
fall
to
cursing
and
peradventure
to
laying
on
the
other
more
pretentious
was
that
a
horse
is
a
poor
milksop
which
drinking
nothing
but
water
has
to
be
cockered
up
and
warmed
outside
but
a
master
being
a
creature
ever
filled
with
good
beer
has
a
store
of
inward
heat
that
warms
him
to
the
skin
and
renders
a
cloak
a
mere
shred
of
idle
vanity
each
of
the
speakers
fell
in
love
with
his
theory
and
to
tell
the
truth
both
had
taken
a
hair
or
two
of
the
dog
that
had
bitten
their
master
to
the
brain
so
their
voices
presently
rose
so
high
that
the
green
sot
began
to
growl
instead
of
snoring
in
their
heat
they
did
not
notice
this
ere
long
the
argument
took
a
turn
that
sooner
or
later
was
pretty
sure
to
enliven
a
discussion
in
that
age
hans
holding
the
bridle
with
his
right
hand
gave
ulric
a
sound
cuff
with
his
left
ulric
returned
it
with
interest
his
right
hand
being
free
and
at
it
they
went
ding
dong
over
the
horse
mane
pommelling
one
another
and
jagging
the
poor
beast
till
he
ran
backward
and
trode
with
iron
heel
upon
a
promontory
of
the
green
lord
he
like
the
toad
stung
by
spear
started
up
howling
with
one
hand
clapped
to
the
smart
and
the
other
tugging
at
his
hilt
the
servants
amazed
with
terror
let
the
horse
go
he
galloped
off
whinnying
the
men
in
pursuit
of
him
crying
out
with
fear
and
the
green
noble
after
them
volleying
curses
his
naked
sword
in
his
hand
and
his
body
rebounding
from
hedge
to
hedge
in
his
headlong
but
zigzag
career
down
the
narrow
lane
in
which
hurtling
gerard
turned
his
back
on
them
all
and
went
calmly
south
glad
to
have
saved
the
four
tin
farthings
he
had
got
ready
for
trinkgeld
but
far
too
heavy
hearted
even
to
smile
at
their
drunken
extravagance
the
sun
was
nearly
setting
and
gerard
who
had
now
for
some
time
been
hoping
in
vain
to
find
an
inn
by
the
way
was
very
ill
at
ease
to
make
matters
worse
black
clouds
gathered
over
the
sky
gerard
quickened
his
pace
almost
to
a
run
it
was
in
vain
down
came
the
rain
in
torrents
drenched
the
bewildered
traveller
and
seemed
to
extinguish
the
very
his
rays
already
fading
could
not
cope
with
this
new
assailant
gerard
trudged
on
dark
and
wet
and
in
an
unknown
region
fool
to
leave
margaret
said
he
presently
the
darkness
thickened
he
was
entering
a
great
wood
huge
branches
shot
across
the
narrow
road
and
the
benighted
stranger
groped
his
way
in
what
seemed
an
interminable
and
inky
cave
with
a
rugged
floor
on
which
he
stumbled
and
stumbled
as
he
went
on
and
on
and
on
with
shivering
limbs
and
empty
stomach
and
fainting
heart
till
the
wolves
rose
from
their
lairs
and
bayed
all
round
the
wood
his
hair
bristled
but
he
grasped
his
cudgel
and
prepared
to
sell
his
life
dear
there
was
no
wind
and
his
excited
ear
heard
light
feet
patter
at
times
over
the
newly
fallen
leaves
and
low
branches
rustle
with
creatures
gliding
swiftly
past
them
presently
in
the
sea
of
ink
there
was
a
great
fiery
star
close
to
the
ground
he
hailed
it
as
he
would
his
patron
saint
candle
a
candle
he
shouted
and
tried
to
run
but
the
dark
and
rugged
way
soon
stopped
that
the
light
was
more
distant
than
he
had
thought
but
at
last
in
the
very
heart
of
the
forest
he
found
a
house
with
lighted
candles
and
loud
voices
inside
it
he
looked
up
to
see
if
there
was
a
signboard
there
was
none
not
an
inn
after
all
said
he
sadly
no
matter
what
christian
would
turn
a
dog
out
into
this
wood
and
with
this
he
made
for
the
door
that
led
to
the
voices
he
opened
it
slowly
and
put
his
head
in
timidly
he
drew
it
out
abruptly
as
if
slapped
in
the
face
and
recoiled
into
the
rain
and
darkness
he
had
peeped
into
a
large
but
low
room
the
middle
of
which
was
filled
by
a
huge
round
stove
or
clay
oven
that
reached
to
the
ceiling
round
this
wet
clothes
were
on
lines
and
some
more
compendiously
on
rustics
these
latter
habiliments
impregnated
with
the
wet
of
the
day
but
the
dirt
of
a
life
and
lined
with
what
another
foot
traveller
in
these
parts
call
rammish
clowns
evolved
rank
vapours
and
compound
odours
inexpressible
in
steaming
clouds
in
one
corner
was
a
travelling
family
a
large
one
thence
flowed
into
the
common
stock
the
peculiar
sickly
smell
of
neglected
brats
garlic
filled
up
the
interstices
of
the
air
and
all
this
with
closed
window
and
intense
heat
of
the
central
furnace
and
the
breath
of
at
least
forty
persons
they
had
just
supped
now
gerard
like
most
artists
had
sensitive
organs
and
the
potent
effluvia
struck
dismay
into
him
but
the
rain
lashed
him
outside
and
the
light
and
the
fire
tempted
him
in
he
could
not
force
his
way
all
at
once
through
the
palpable
perfumes
but
he
returned
to
the
light
again
and
again
like
the
singed
moth
at
last
he
discovered
that
the
various
smells
did
not
entirely
mix
no
fiend
being
there
to
stir
them
round
odour
of
family
predominated
in
two
corners
stewed
rustic
reigned
supreme
in
the
centre
and
garlic
in
the
noisy
group
by
the
window
he
found
too
by
hasty
analysis
that
of
these
the
garlic
described
the
smallest
aerial
orbit
and
the
scent
of
reeking
rustic
darted
farthest
a
flavour
as
if
ancient
goats
or
the
fathers
of
all
foxes
had
been
drawn
through
a
river
and
were
here
dried
by
nebuchadnezzar
so
gerard
crept
into
a
corner
close
to
the
door
but
though
the
solidity
of
the
main
fetors
isolated
them
somewhat
the
heat
and
reeking
vapours
circulated
and
made
the
walls
drip
and
the
novice
found
something
like
a
cold
snake
wind
about
his
legs
and
his
head
turn
to
a
great
lump
of
lead
and
next
he
felt
like
choking
sweetly
slumbering
and
dying
all
in
one
he
was
within
an
ace
of
swooning
but
recovered
to
a
deep
sense
of
disgust
and
discouragement
and
settled
to
go
back
to
holland
at
peep
of
day
this
resolution
formed
he
plucked
up
a
little
heart
and
being
faint
with
hunger
asked
one
of
the
men
of
garlic
whether
this
was
not
an
inn
after
all
whence
come
you
who
know
not
star
of
the
forest
was
the
reply
i
am
a
stranger
and
in
my
country
inns
have
aye
a
droll
country
yours
what
need
of
a
sign
to
a
a
place
that
every
soul
knows
gerard
was
too
tired
and
faint
for
the
labour
of
argument
so
he
turned
the
conversation
and
asked
where
he
could
find
the
landlord
at
this
fresh
display
of
ignorance
the
native
contempt
rose
too
high
for
words
he
pointed
to
a
woman
seated
on
the
other
side
of
the
oven
and
turning
to
his
mates
let
them
know
what
an
outlandish
animal
was
in
the
room
thereat
the
loud
voices
stopped
one
by
one
as
the
information
penetrated
the
mass
and
each
eye
turned
as
on
a
pivot
following
gerard
and
his
every
movement
silently
and
zoologically
the
landlady
sat
on
a
chair
an
inch
or
two
higher
than
the
rest
between
two
bundles
from
the
first
a
huge
heap
of
feathers
and
wings
she
was
taking
the
downy
plumes
and
pulling
the
others
from
the
quills
and
so
filling
bundle
two
littering
the
floor
and
contributing
to
the
general
stock
a
stuffy
little
malaria
which
might
have
played
a
distinguished
part
in
a
sweet
room
but
went
for
nothing
here
gerard
asked
her
if
he
could
have
something
to
eat
she
opened
her
eyes
with
astonishment
supper
is
over
this
hour
and
more
but
i
had
none
of
it
good
is
that
my
fault
you
were
welcome
to
your
share
for
but
i
was
benighted
and
a
stranger
and
belated
sore
against
my
what
have
i
to
do
with
that
all
the
world
knows
star
of
the
forest
sups
from
six
till
eight
come
before
six
ye
sup
well
come
before
eight
ye
sup
as
pleases
heaven
come
after
eight
ye
get
a
clean
bed
and
a
stirrup
cup
or
a
horn
of
kine
milk
at
the
gerard
looked
blank
may
i
go
to
bed
then
dame
said
he
sulkily
for
it
is
ill
sitting
up
wet
and
fasting
and
the
byword
saith
sups
who
sleeps
the
beds
are
not
come
yet
replied
the
landlady
you
will
sleep
when
the
rest
do
inns
are
not
built
for
it
was
gerard
turn
to
be
astonished
the
beds
were
not
come
what
in
heaven
name
did
she
mean
but
he
was
afraid
to
ask
for
every
word
he
had
spoken
hitherto
had
amazed
the
assembly
and
zoological
eyes
were
upon
him
he
felt
them
he
leaned
against
the
wall
and
sighed
audibly
at
this
fresh
zoological
trait
a
titter
went
round
the
watchful
company
so
this
is
germany
thought
gerard
and
germany
is
a
great
country
by
holland
small
nations
for
he
consoled
himself
by
reflecting
it
was
to
be
his
last
as
well
as
his
first
night
in
the
land
his
reverie
was
interrupted
by
an
elbow
driven
into
his
ribs
he
turned
sharp
on
his
assailant
who
pointed
across
the
room
gerard
looked
and
a
woman
in
the
corner
was
beckoning
him
he
went
towards
her
gingerly
being
surprised
and
irresolute
so
that
to
a
spectator
her
beckoning
finger
seemed
to
be
pulling
him
across
the
floor
with
a
when
he
had
got
up
to
her
hold
the
child
said
she
in
a
fine
hearty
voice
and
in
a
moment
she
plumped
the
bairn
into
gerard
arms
he
stood
transfixed
jelly
of
lead
in
his
hands
and
sudden
horror
in
his
elongated
countenance
at
this
ruefully
expressive
face
the
conclave
laughed
loud
and
long
never
heed
them
said
the
woman
cheerfully
they
know
no
better
how
should
they
bred
an
born
in
a
wood
she
was
rummaging
among
her
clothes
with
the
two
penetrating
hands
one
of
which
gerard
had
set
free
presently
she
fished
out
a
small
tin
plate
and
a
dried
pudding
and
resuming
her
child
with
one
arm
held
them
forth
to
gerard
with
the
other
keeping
a
thumb
on
the
pudding
to
prevent
it
from
slipping
off
put
it
in
the
stove
said
she
you
are
too
young
to
lie
down
gerard
thanked
her
warmly
but
on
his
way
to
the
stove
his
eye
fell
on
the
landlady
may
i
dame
said
he
beseechingly
why
not
said
she
the
question
was
evidently
another
surprise
though
less
startling
than
its
predecessors
coming
to
the
stove
gerard
found
the
oven
door
obstructed
by
the
rammish
they
did
not
budge
he
hesitated
a
moment
the
landlady
saw
calmly
put
down
her
work
and
coming
up
pulled
a
hircine
man
or
two
hither
and
pushed
a
hircine
man
or
two
thither
with
the
impassive
countenance
of
a
housewife
moving
her
furniture
turn
about
is
fair
play
she
said
ye
have
been
dry
this
ten
minutes
and
her
experienced
eye
was
not
deceived
gorgonii
had
done
stewing
and
begun
baking
debarred
the
stove
they
trundled
home
all
but
one
who
stood
like
a
table
where
the
landlady
had
moved
him
to
like
a
table
and
gerard
baked
his
pudding
and
getting
to
the
stove
burst
into
steam
the
door
opened
and
in
flew
a
bundle
of
straw
it
was
hurled
by
a
hind
with
a
pitchfork
another
and
another
came
flying
after
it
till
the
room
was
like
a
clean
farmyard
these
were
then
dispersed
round
the
stove
in
layers
like
the
seats
in
an
arena
and
in
a
moment
the
company
was
all
on
its
back
the
beds
had
come
gerard
took
out
his
pudding
and
found
it
delicious
while
he
was
relishing
it
the
woman
who
had
given
it
him
and
who
was
now
abed
beckoned
him
again
he
went
to
her
bundle
side
she
is
waiting
for
you
whispered
the
woman
gerard
returned
to
the
stove
and
gobbled
the
rest
of
his
sausage
casting
uneasy
glances
at
the
landlady
seated
silent
as
fate
amid
the
prostrate
multitude
the
food
bolted
he
went
to
her
and
said
thank
you
kindly
dame
for
waiting
for
you
are
welcome
said
she
calmly
making
neither
much
nor
little
of
the
favour
and
with
that
began
to
gather
up
the
feathers
but
gerard
stopped
her
nay
that
is
my
task
and
he
went
down
on
his
knees
and
collected
them
with
ardour
she
watched
him
demurely
i
wot
not
whence
ye
come
said
she
with
a
relic
of
distrust
adding
more
cordially
but
ye
have
been
well
brought
up
y
have
had
a
good
mother
i
go
at
the
door
she
committed
the
whole
company
to
heaven
in
a
formula
and
disappeared
gerard
to
his
straw
in
the
very
the
guests
lay
round
the
sacred
stove
by
seniority
priority
of
arrival
this
punishment
was
a
boon
to
gerard
for
thus
he
lay
on
the
shore
of
odour
and
stifling
heat
instead
of
in
he
was
just
dropping
off
when
he
was
awaked
by
a
noise
and
lo
there
was
the
hind
remorselessly
shaking
and
waking
guest
after
guest
to
ask
him
whether
it
was
he
who
had
picked
up
the
mistress
feathers
it
was
i
cried
gerard
oh
it
was
you
was
it
said
the
other
and
came
striding
rapidly
over
the
intermediate
sleepers
she
bade
me
say
good
turn
deserves
another
and
so
here
your
nightcap
and
he
thrust
a
great
oaken
mug
under
gerard
nose
i
thank
her
and
bless
her
here
goes
ugh
and
his
gratitude
ended
in
a
wry
face
for
the
beer
was
muddy
and
had
a
strange
medicinal
twang
new
to
the
hollander
trinke
aus
shouted
the
hind
reproachfully
enow
is
as
good
as
a
feast
said
the
youth
jesuitically
the
hind
cast
a
look
of
pity
on
this
stranger
who
left
liquor
in
his
mug
ich
brings
euch
said
he
and
drained
it
to
the
bottom
and
now
gerard
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
pulled
up
two
handfuls
of
the
nice
clean
straw
and
bored
in
them
with
his
finger
and
so
made
a
scabbard
and
sheathed
his
nose
in
it
and
soon
they
were
all
asleep
men
maids
wives
and
children
all
lying
and
snoring
in
a
dozen
keys
like
an
orchestra
slowly
tuning
and
gerard
body
lay
on
straw
in
germany
and
his
spirit
was
away
to
sevenbergen
when
he
woke
in
the
morning
he
found
nearly
all
his
gone
one
or
two
were
waiting
for
dinner
nine
it
was
now
six
he
paid
the
landlady
her
demand
two
pfenning
or
about
an
english
halfpenny
and
he
of
the
pitchfork
demanded
trinkgeld
and
getting
a
trifle
more
than
usual
and
seeing
gerard
eye
a
foaming
he
had
just
brought
from
the
cow
hoisted
it
up
bodily
to
his
lips
drink
your
fill
man
said
he
and
on
gerard
offering
to
pay
for
the
delicious
draught
told
him
in
broad
patois
that
a
man
might
swallow
a
skinful
of
milk
or
a
breakfast
of
air
without
putting
hand
to
pouch
at
the
door
gerard
found
his
benefactress
of
last
night
and
a
artisan
her
husband
gerard
thanked
her
and
in
the
spirit
of
the
age
offered
her
a
creutzer
for
her
pudding
but
she
repulsed
his
hand
quietly
for
what
do
you
take
me
said
she
colouring
faintly
we
are
travellers
and
strangers
the
same
as
you
and
bound
to
feel
for
those
in
like
then
gerard
blushed
in
his
turn
and
stammered
excuses
the
hulking
husband
grinned
superior
to
them
both
give
the
vixen
a
kiss
for
her
pudding
and
cry
quits
said
he
with
an
air
impartial
and
gerard
obeyed
the
lofty
behest
and
kissed
the
wife
cheek
a
blessing
go
with
you
both
good
people
said
he
and
god
speed
you
young
man
replied
the
honest
couple
and
with
that
they
parted
and
never
met
again
in
this
world
the
sun
had
just
risen
the
on
the
leaves
glittered
like
diamonds
the
air
was
fresh
and
bracing
and
gerard
steered
south
and
did
not
even
remember
his
resolve
of
overnight
eight
leagues
he
walked
that
day
and
in
the
afternoon
came
upon
a
huge
building
with
an
enormous
arched
gateway
and
a
postern
by
its
side
a
monastery
cried
he
joyfully
i
go
no
further
lest
i
fare
he
applied
at
the
postern
and
on
stating
whence
he
came
and
whither
bound
was
instantly
admitted
and
directed
to
the
guestchamber
a
large
and
lofty
room
where
travellers
were
fed
and
lodged
gratis
by
the
charity
of
the
monastic
orders
soon
the
bell
tinkled
for
vespers
and
gerard
entered
the
church
of
the
convent
and
from
his
place
heard
a
service
sung
so
exquisitely
it
seemed
the
choir
of
heaven
but
one
thing
was
wanting
margaret
was
not
there
to
hear
it
with
him
and
this
made
him
sigh
bitterly
in
mid
rapture
at
supper
plain
but
wholesome
and
abundant
food
and
good
beer
brewed
in
the
convent
were
set
before
him
and
his
fellows
and
at
an
early
hour
they
were
ushered
into
a
large
dormitory
and
the
number
being
moderate
had
each
a
truckle
bed
and
for
covering
sheepskins
dressed
with
the
fleece
on
but
previously
to
this
a
monk
struck
by
his
youth
and
beauty
questioned
him
and
soon
drew
out
his
projects
and
his
heart
when
he
was
found
to
be
convent
bred
and
going
alone
to
rome
he
became
a
personage
and
in
the
morning
they
showed
him
over
the
convent
and
made
him
stay
and
dine
in
the
refectory
they
also
pricked
him
a
route
on
a
slip
of
parchment
and
the
prior
gave
him
a
silver
guilden
to
help
him
on
the
road
and
advised
him
to
join
the
first
honest
company
he
should
fall
in
with
and
not
face
alone
the
manifold
perils
of
the
perils
said
gerard
to
himself
that
evening
he
came
to
a
small
straggling
town
where
was
one
inn
it
had
no
sign
but
being
now
better
versed
in
the
customs
of
the
country
he
detected
it
at
once
by
the
coats
of
arms
on
its
walls
these
belonged
to
the
distinguished
visitors
who
had
slept
in
it
at
different
epochs
since
its
foundation
and
left
these
customary
tokens
of
their
patronage
at
present
it
looked
more
like
a
mausoleum
than
a
hotel
nothing
moved
nor
sounded
either
in
it
or
about
it
gerard
hammered
on
the
great
oak
door
no
answer
he
hallooed
no
reply
after
a
while
he
hallooed
louder
and
at
last
a
little
round
window
or
rather
hole
in
the
wall
opened
a
man
head
protruded
cautiously
like
a
from
its
shell
and
eyed
gerard
stolidly
but
never
uttered
a
syllable
is
this
an
inn
asked
gerard
with
a
covert
sneer
the
head
seemed
to
fall
into
a
brown
study
eventually
it
nodded
but
lazily
can
i
have
entertainment
here
again
the
head
pondered
and
ended
by
nodding
but
sullenly
and
seemed
a
skull
overburdened
with
interrogatories
how
am
i
to
get
within
a
please
you
at
this
the
head
popped
in
as
if
the
last
question
had
shot
it
and
a
hand
popped
out
pointed
round
the
corner
of
the
building
and
slammed
the
window
gerard
followed
the
indication
and
after
some
research
discovered
that
the
fortification
had
one
vulnerable
part
a
small
low
door
on
its
flank
as
for
the
main
entrance
that
was
used
to
keep
out
thieves
and
customers
except
once
or
twice
in
a
year
when
they
entered
together
when
some
duke
or
count
arrived
in
pomp
with
his
train
of
gaudy
ruffians
gerard
having
penetrated
the
outer
fort
soon
found
his
way
to
the
stove
as
the
public
room
was
called
from
the
principal
article
in
it
and
sat
down
near
the
oven
in
which
were
only
a
few
live
embers
that
diffused
a
mild
and
grateful
heat
after
waiting
patiently
a
long
time
he
asked
a
grim
old
fellow
with
a
long
white
beard
who
stalked
solemnly
in
and
turned
the
and
then
was
stalking
out
when
supper
would
be
the
grisly
ganymede
counted
the
guests
on
his
fingers
when
i
see
thrice
as
many
here
as
gerard
groaned
the
grisly
tyrant
resented
the
rebellious
sound
inns
are
not
built
for
one
said
he
if
you
ca
wait
for
the
rest
look
out
for
another
gerard
sighed
at
this
the
greybeard
frowned
after
a
while
company
trickled
steadily
in
till
full
eighty
persons
of
various
conditions
were
congregated
and
to
our
novice
the
place
became
a
chamber
of
horrors
for
here
the
mothers
got
together
and
compared
ringworms
and
the
men
scraped
the
mud
off
their
shoes
with
their
knives
and
left
it
on
the
floor
and
combed
their
long
hair
out
inmates
included
and
made
their
toilet
consisting
generally
of
a
dry
rub
water
however
was
brought
in
ewers
gerard
pounced
on
one
of
these
but
at
sight
of
the
liquid
contents
lost
his
temper
and
said
to
the
waiter
wash
you
first
your
water
and
then
a
man
may
wash
his
hands
an
it
likes
you
not
seek
another
inn
gerard
said
nothing
but
went
quietly
and
courteously
besought
an
old
traveller
to
tell
him
how
far
it
was
to
the
next
inn
about
four
then
gerard
appreciated
the
grim
pleasantry
of
the
unbending
sire
that
worthy
now
returned
with
an
armful
of
wood
and
counting
the
travellers
put
on
a
log
for
every
six
by
which
act
of
raw
justice
the
hotter
the
room
the
more
heat
he
added
poor
gerard
noticed
this
little
flaw
in
the
ancient
man
logic
but
carefully
suppressed
every
symptom
of
intelligence
lest
his
feet
should
have
to
carry
his
brains
four
leagues
farther
that
night
when
perspiration
and
suffocation
were
far
advanced
they
brought
in
the
but
oh
so
brown
so
dirty
and
so
coarse
they
seemed
like
sacks
that
had
been
worn
out
in
agriculture
and
come
down
to
this
or
like
shreads
from
the
mainsail
of
some
ship
the
hollander
who
had
never
seen
such
linen
even
in
nightmare
uttered
a
faint
cry
what
is
to
do
inquired
a
traveller
gerard
pointed
ruefully
to
the
dirty
sackcloth
the
other
looked
at
it
with
lack
lustre
eye
and
comprehended
nought
a
burgundian
soldier
with
his
arbalest
at
his
back
came
peeping
over
gerard
shoulder
and
seeing
what
was
amiss
laughed
so
loud
that
the
room
rang
again
then
slapped
him
on
the
back
and
cried
courage
le
diable
est
gerard
stared
he
doubted
alike
the
good
tidings
and
their
relevancy
but
the
tones
were
so
hearty
and
the
arbalestrier
face
notwithstanding
a
formidable
beard
was
so
gay
and
genial
that
he
smiled
and
after
a
pause
said
drily
il
a
bien
faite
avec
et
linge
du
pays
on
allait
le
noircir
a
ne
se
reconnaitre
tiens
tiens
cried
the
soldier
qui
parle
le
francais
peu
faut
and
he
seated
himself
by
gerard
and
in
a
moment
was
talking
volubly
of
war
women
and
pillage
interlarding
his
discourse
with
curious
oaths
at
which
gerard
drew
away
from
him
more
or
less
presently
in
came
the
grisly
servant
and
counted
them
all
on
his
fingers
superciliously
like
abraham
telling
sheep
then
went
out
again
and
returned
with
a
deal
trencher
and
deal
spoon
to
each
then
there
was
an
interval
then
he
brought
them
a
long
mug
apiece
made
of
glass
and
frowned
he
stalked
gloomily
in
with
a
hunch
of
bread
apiece
and
exit
with
an
injured
air
expectation
thus
raised
the
guests
sat
for
nearly
an
hour
balancing
the
wooden
spoons
and
with
their
own
knives
whittling
the
bread
eventually
when
hope
was
extinct
patience
worn
out
and
hunger
exhausted
a
huge
vessel
was
brought
in
with
pomp
the
lid
was
removed
a
cloud
of
steam
rolled
forth
and
behold
some
thin
broth
with
square
pieces
of
bread
floating
this
though
not
agreeable
to
the
mind
served
to
distend
the
body
slices
of
strasbourg
ham
followed
and
pieces
of
salt
fish
both
so
highly
salted
that
gerard
could
hardly
swallow
a
mouthful
then
came
a
kind
of
gruel
and
when
the
repast
had
lasted
an
hour
and
more
some
hashed
meat
highly
peppered
and
the
french
and
dutch
being
now
full
to
the
brim
with
the
above
dainties
and
the
draughts
of
beer
the
salt
and
spiced
meats
had
provoked
in
came
roasted
kids
most
excellent
and
carp
and
trout
fresh
from
the
stream
gerard
made
an
effort
and
looked
angrily
at
them
but
could
no
more
as
the
poets
say
the
burgundian
swore
by
the
liver
and
of
the
good
centurion
the
natives
had
outwitted
him
then
turning
to
gerard
he
said
courage
le
diable
est
mort
as
loudly
as
before
but
not
with
the
same
tone
of
conviction
the
canny
natives
had
kept
an
internal
corner
for
contingencies
and
polished
the
kid
very
bones
the
feast
ended
with
a
dish
of
raw
animalcula
in
a
wicker
cage
a
cheese
had
been
surrounded
with
little
twigs
and
strings
then
a
hole
made
in
it
and
a
little
sour
wine
poured
in
this
speedily
bred
a
small
but
numerous
vermin
when
the
cheese
was
so
rotten
with
them
that
only
the
twigs
and
string
kept
it
from
tumbling
to
pieces
and
walking
off
quadrivious
it
came
to
table
by
a
malicious
caprice
of
fate
cage
and
menagerie
were
put
down
right
under
the
dutchman
organ
of
he
recoiled
with
a
loud
ejaculation
and
hung
to
the
bench
by
the
calves
of
his
legs
what
is
the
matter
said
a
traveller
disdainfully
does
the
good
cheese
scare
ye
then
put
it
hither
in
the
name
of
all
the
saints
cheese
cried
gerard
i
see
none
these
nauseous
reptiles
have
made
away
with
every
bit
of
well
replied
another
it
is
not
gone
far
by
eating
of
the
mites
we
eat
the
cheese
to
nay
not
so
said
gerard
these
reptiles
are
made
like
us
and
digest
their
food
and
turn
it
to
foul
flesh
even
as
we
do
ours
to
sweet
as
well
might
you
think
to
chew
grass
by
eating
of
beeves
as
to
eat
cheese
by
swallowing
these
uncleanly
gerard
raised
his
voice
in
uttering
this
and
the
company
received
the
paradox
in
dead
silence
and
with
a
distrustful
air
like
any
other
stranger
during
which
the
burgundian
who
understood
german
but
imperfectly
made
gerard
gallicize
the
discussion
he
patted
his
interpreter
on
the
back
bien
mon
gars
plus
fin
que
toi
pas
bete
and
administered
his
formula
of
encouragement
and
gerard
edged
away
from
him
for
next
to
ugly
sights
and
ill
odours
the
poor
wretch
disliked
profaneness
meantime
though
shaken
in
argument
the
raw
reptiles
were
duly
eaten
and
relished
by
the
company
and
served
to
provoke
thirst
a
principal
aim
of
all
the
solids
in
that
part
of
germany
so
now
the
company
drank
garausses
all
round
and
their
tongues
were
unloosed
and
oh
the
babel
but
above
the
fierce
clamour
rose
at
intervals
like
some
hero
in
battle
the
voice
of
the
burgundian
soldier
shouting
lustily
courage
camarades
le
diable
est
mort
entered
grisly
ganymede
holding
in
his
hand
a
wooden
dish
with
circles
and
semicircles
marked
on
it
in
chalk
he
put
it
down
on
the
table
and
stood
silent
sad
and
sombre
as
charon
by
styx
waiting
for
his
of
souls
then
pouches
and
purses
were
rummaged
and
each
threw
a
coin
into
the
dish
gerard
timidly
observed
that
he
had
drunk
next
to
no
beer
and
inquired
how
much
less
he
was
to
pay
than
the
others
what
mean
you
said
ganymede
roughly
whose
fault
is
it
you
have
not
drunken
are
all
to
suffer
because
one
chooses
to
be
a
milksop
you
will
pay
no
more
than
the
rest
and
no
gerard
was
abashed
courage
petit
le
diable
est
mort
hiccoughed
the
soldier
and
flung
ganymede
a
coin
you
are
bad
as
he
is
said
the
old
man
peevishly
you
are
paying
too
much
and
the
tyrannical
old
aristides
returned
him
some
coin
out
of
the
trencher
with
a
most
reproachful
countenance
and
now
the
man
whom
gerard
had
confuted
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
awoke
from
a
brown
study
in
which
he
had
been
ever
since
and
came
to
him
and
said
yes
but
the
honey
is
none
the
worse
for
passing
through
the
bees
gerard
stared
the
answer
had
been
so
long
on
the
road
he
had
an
idea
what
it
was
an
answer
to
seeing
him
dumfounded
the
other
concluded
him
confuted
and
withdrew
calmed
the
bedrooms
were
upstairs
dungeons
with
not
a
scrap
of
furniture
except
the
bed
and
a
male
servant
settled
inexorably
who
should
sleep
with
whom
neither
money
nor
prayers
would
get
a
man
a
bed
to
himself
here
custom
forbade
it
sternly
you
might
as
well
have
asked
to
monopolize
a
they
assigned
to
gerard
a
man
with
a
great
black
beard
he
was
an
honest
fellow
enough
but
not
perfect
he
would
not
go
to
bed
and
would
sit
on
the
edge
of
it
telling
the
wretched
gerard
by
force
and
at
length
the
events
of
the
day
and
alternately
laughing
and
crying
at
the
same
circumstances
which
were
not
in
the
smallest
degree
pathetic
or
humorous
but
only
dead
trivial
at
last
gerard
put
his
fingers
in
his
ears
and
lying
down
in
his
clothes
for
the
sheets
were
too
dirty
for
him
to
undress
contrived
to
sleep
but
in
an
hour
or
two
he
awoke
cold
and
found
that
his
drunken
companion
had
got
all
the
feather
bed
so
mighty
is
instinct
they
lay
between
two
beds
the
lower
one
hard
and
made
of
straw
the
upper
soft
and
filled
with
feathers
light
as
down
gerard
pulled
at
it
but
the
experienced
drunkard
held
it
fast
mechanically
gerard
tried
to
twitch
it
away
by
surprise
but
instinct
was
too
many
for
him
on
this
he
got
out
of
bed
and
kneeling
down
on
his
bedfellow
unguarded
side
easily
whipped
the
prize
away
and
rolled
with
it
under
the
bed
and
there
lay
on
one
edge
of
it
and
curled
the
rest
round
his
shoulders
before
he
slept
he
often
heard
something
grumbling
and
growling
above
him
which
was
some
little
satisfaction
thus
instinct
was
outwitted
and
victorious
reason
lay
chuckling
on
feathers
and
not
quite
choked
with
dust
at
peep
of
day
gerard
rose
flung
the
feather
bed
upon
his
snoring
companion
and
went
in
search
of
milk
and
air
a
cheerful
voice
hailed
him
in
french
what
ho
you
are
up
with
the
sun
he
rises
betimes
that
lies
in
a
dog
lair
answered
gerard
crossly
courage
le
diable
est
mort
was
the
instant
reply
the
soldier
then
told
him
his
name
was
denys
and
he
was
passing
from
flushing
in
zealand
to
the
duke
french
dominions
a
change
the
more
agreeable
to
him
as
he
should
revisit
his
native
place
and
a
host
of
pretty
girls
who
had
wept
at
his
departure
and
should
hear
french
spoken
again
and
who
are
you
and
whither
bound
my
name
is
gerard
and
i
am
going
to
rome
said
the
more
reserved
hollander
and
in
a
way
that
invited
no
further
confidences
all
the
better
we
will
go
together
as
far
as
that
is
not
my
all
roads
take
to
ay
but
the
shortest
road
thither
is
my
well
then
it
is
i
who
must
go
out
of
my
way
a
step
for
the
sake
of
good
company
for
thy
face
likes
me
and
thou
speakest
french
or
there
go
two
words
to
that
bargain
said
gerard
coldly
i
steer
by
proverbs
too
they
do
put
old
heads
on
young
men
shoulders
loup
mauvais
compagnon
dit
le
brebis
and
a
soldier
they
say
is
near
akin
to
a
they
lie
said
denys
besides
if
he
is
loups
ne
se
mangent
pas
entre
eux
aye
but
sir
soldier
i
am
not
a
wolf
and
thou
knowest
a
bien
petite
occasion
se
saisit
le
loup
du
mouton
let
us
drop
wolves
and
sheep
being
men
my
meaning
is
that
a
good
soldier
never
comrade
come
young
man
too
much
suspicion
becomes
not
your
years
they
who
travel
should
learn
to
read
faces
methinks
you
might
see
lealty
in
mine
sith
i
have
seen
it
in
yourn
is
it
yon
fat
purse
at
your
girdle
you
fear
for
gerard
turned
pale
look
hither
and
he
undid
his
belt
and
poured
out
of
it
a
double
handful
of
gold
pieces
then
returned
them
to
their
there
is
a
hostage
for
you
said
he
carry
you
that
and
let
us
be
comrades
and
handed
him
his
belt
gold
and
all
gerard
stared
if
i
am
over
prudent
you
have
not
but
he
flushed
and
looked
pleased
at
the
other
trust
in
him
bah
i
can
read
faces
and
so
must
you
or
you
never
take
your
four
bones
safe
to
soldier
you
would
find
me
a
dull
companion
for
my
heart
is
very
heavy
said
gerard
yielding
i
cheer
you
mon
i
think
you
would
said
gerard
sweetly
and
sore
need
have
i
of
a
kindly
voice
in
mine
ear
this
oh
no
soul
is
sad
alongside
me
i
lift
up
their
poor
little
hearts
with
my
consigne
tout
le
monde
le
diable
est
mort
ha
ha
so
be
it
then
said
gerard
but
take
back
your
belt
for
i
could
never
trust
by
halves
we
will
go
together
as
far
as
rhine
and
god
go
with
us
both
amen
said
denys
and
lifted
his
cap
en
avant
the
pair
trudged
manfully
on
and
denys
enlivened
the
weary
way
he
chattered
about
battles
and
sieges
and
things
which
were
new
to
gerard
and
he
was
one
of
those
who
make
little
incidents
wherever
they
go
he
passed
nobody
without
addressing
them
they
do
understand
it
but
it
wakes
them
up
said
he
but
whenever
they
fell
in
with
a
monk
or
priest
he
pulled
a
long
face
and
sought
the
reverend
blessing
and
fearlessly
poured
out
on
him
floods
of
german
words
in
such
order
as
not
to
produce
a
single
german
sentence
he
doffed
his
cap
to
every
woman
high
or
low
he
caught
sight
of
and
with
eagle
eye
discerned
her
best
feature
and
complimented
her
on
it
in
his
native
tongue
well
adapted
to
such
matters
and
at
each
carrion
crow
or
magpie
down
came
his
crossbow
and
he
would
go
a
furlong
off
the
road
to
circumvent
it
and
indeed
he
did
shoot
one
old
crow
with
laudable
neatness
and
despatch
and
carried
it
to
the
nearest
and
there
slipped
in
and
set
it
upon
a
nest
the
will
say
here
is
beelzebub
ahatching
of
my
eggs
no
you
forget
he
is
dead
objected
gerard
so
he
is
so
he
is
but
she
does
know
that
not
having
the
luck
to
be
acquainted
with
me
who
carry
the
good
news
from
city
to
city
uplifting
men
such
was
denys
in
time
of
peace
our
travellers
towards
nightfall
reached
a
village
it
was
a
very
small
one
but
contained
a
place
of
entertainment
they
searched
for
it
and
found
a
small
house
with
barn
and
stables
in
the
former
was
the
everlasting
stove
and
the
clothes
drying
round
it
on
lines
and
a
traveller
or
two
sitting
morose
gerard
asked
for
supper
supper
we
have
no
time
to
cook
for
travellers
we
only
provide
lodging
good
lodging
for
man
and
beast
you
can
have
some
madman
who
born
in
holland
sought
other
lands
snorted
gerard
in
dutch
the
landlady
started
what
gibberish
is
that
asked
she
and
crossed
herself
with
looks
of
superstitious
alarm
you
can
buy
what
you
like
in
the
village
and
cook
it
in
our
oven
but
prithee
mutter
no
charms
nor
sorceries
here
good
man
do
ye
now
it
do
make
my
flesh
creep
they
scoured
the
village
for
food
and
ended
by
supping
on
roasted
eggs
and
brown
bread
at
a
very
early
hour
their
chambermaid
came
for
them
it
was
a
old
fellow
with
a
lanthorn
they
followed
him
he
led
them
across
a
dirty
farmyard
where
they
had
much
ado
to
pick
their
steps
and
brought
them
into
a
there
on
each
side
of
every
cow
was
laid
a
little
clean
straw
and
a
tied
bundle
of
ditto
for
a
pillow
the
old
man
looked
down
on
this
his
work
with
paternal
pride
not
so
gerard
what
do
you
set
christian
men
to
lie
among
cattle
well
it
is
hard
upon
the
poor
beasts
they
have
scarce
room
to
oh
what
it
is
not
hard
on
us
then
where
is
the
hardship
i
have
lain
among
them
all
my
life
look
at
me

am
fourscore

born
days

among
the
kye
bless
your
silly
head
kine
breath

ten
times
sweeter
to
drink
nor
christians

try
it
and
he
slammed
the
bedroom
door
denys
where

gerard
here
on
her
other
what

field

but
this
is
well
we
had
a
little
battle
in
brabant
and
won
a
little
victory
but
it
cost
us
dear
several
arbalestriers
turned
their
toes
up
and
i
among
killed
denys
come
now
dead
as
mutton
stuck
full
of
till
the
blood
ran
out
of
me
like
the
good
wine
of
macon
from
the
trodden
grapes
it
is
right
bounteous
in
me
to
pour
the
tale
in
minstrel
phrase
for
augh
i
am
sleepy
augh
now
where
was
i
left
dead
on
the
field
of
battle
bleeding
like
a
pig
that
is
to
say
like
grapes
or
something
go
on
prithee
go
on
is
a
sin
to
sleep
in
the
midst
of
a
good
granted
well
some
of
those
vagabonds
that
strip
the
dead
soldier
on
the
field
of
glory
came
and
took
every
rag
off
me
they
wrought
me
no
further
ill
because
there
was
no
no
you
were
convenu
this
must
have
been
at
sundown
and
with
the
night
came
a
shrewd
frost
that
barkened
the
blood
on
my
wounds
and
stopped
all
the
rivulets
that
were
running
from
my
heart
and
about
midnight
i
awoke
as
from
a
trance
and
thought
you
were
in
heaven
asked
gerard
eagerly
being
a
youth
inoculated
with
monkish
tales
too
for
that
mon
gars
besides
i
heard
the
wounded
groaning
on
all
sides
so
i
knew
i
was
in
the
old
place
i
saw
i
could
not
live
the
night
through
without
cover
i
groped
about
shivering
and
shivering
at
last
one
did
suddenly
leave
groaning
are
sped
said
i
so
made
up
to
him
and
true
enough
he
was
dead
but
warm
you
know
i
took
my
lord
in
my
arms
but
was
too
weak
to
carry
him
so
rolled
with
him
into
a
ditch
hard
by
and
there
my
comrades
found
me
in
the
morning
properly
stung
with
nettles
and
hugging
a
dead
fleming
for
the
bare
gerard
shuddered
and
this
is
war
this
is
the
chosen
theme
of
poets
and
troubadours
and
reden
ryckers
truly
was
it
said
by
the
men
of
old
dulce
bellum
tu
dis
i
what
stout
hearts
some
men
have
pas
so
after
that
sort
thing
this
sort
thing
is
heaven
soft
warm
good
company
comradancow
diable
and
the
glib
tongue
was
still
for
some
hours
in
the
morning
gerard
was
wakened
by
a
liquid
hitting
his
eye
and
it
was
denys
employing
the
cow
udder
as
a
squirt
oh
fie
cried
gerard
to
waste
the
good
milk
and
he
took
a
horn
out
of
his
wallet
fill
this
but
indeed
i
see
not
what
right
we
have
to
meddle
with
her
milk
at
make
your
mind
easy
last
night
la
camarade
was
not
nice
but
what
then
true
friendship
dispenses
with
ceremony
we
make
as
free
with
why
what
did
she
do
poor
thing
ate
my
ha
ha
on
waking
i
had
to
hunt
for
my
head
and
found
it
down
in
the
stable
gutter
she
ate
our
pillow
from
us
we
drink
our
pillow
from
her
a
votre
sante
madame
et
sans
rancune
and
the
dog
drank
her
milk
to
her
own
health
the
ancient
was
right
though
said
gerard
never
have
i
risen
so
refreshed
since
i
left
my
native
land
henceforth
let
us
shun
great
towns
and
still
lie
in
a
convent
or
a
for
i
liever
sleep
on
fresh
straw
than
on
linen
well
washed
six
months
agone
and
the
breath
of
kine
it
is
sweeter
than
that
of
christians
let
alone
the
garlic
which
men
and
women
folk
affect
but
cowen
abhor
from
and
so
do
i
bavon
be
my
witness
the
soldier
eyed
him
from
head
to
foot
now
but
for
that
little
tuft
on
your
chin
i
should
take
you
for
a
girl
and
by
the
of
luke
no
one
these
three
towns
proved
types
and
repeated
themselves
with
slight
variations
for
many
a
weary
league
but
even
when
he
could
get
neither
a
convent
nor
a
gerard
learned
in
time
to
steel
himself
to
the
inevitable
and
to
emulate
his
comrade
whom
he
looked
on
as
almost
superhuman
for
hardihood
of
body
and
spirit
there
was
however
a
balance
to
all
this
veneration
denys
like
his
predecessor
achilles
had
his
weak
part
his
very
weak
part
thought
gerard
his
foible
was
whatever
he
was
saying
or
doing
he
stopped
short
at
sight
of
a
farthingale
and
his
whole
soul
became
occupied
with
that
garment
and
its
inmate
till
they
had
disappeared
and
sometimes
for
a
good
while
after
he
often
put
gerard
to
the
blush
by
talking
his
amazing
german
to
such
females
as
he
caught
standing
or
sitting
indoors
or
out
at
which
they
stared
and
when
he
met
a
peasant
girl
on
the
road
he
took
off
his
cap
to
her
and
saluted
her
as
if
she
was
a
queen
the
invariable
effect
of
which
was
that
she
suddenly
drew
herself
up
quite
stiff
like
a
soldier
on
parade
and
wore
a
forbidding
countenance
they
drive
me
to
despair
said
denys
is
that
a
just
return
to
a
civil
bonnetade
they
are
large
they
are
fair
but
stupid
as
what
breeding
can
you
expect
from
women
that
wear
no
hose
inquired
gerard
and
some
of
them
no
shoon
they
seem
to
me
reserved
and
modest
as
becomes
their
sex
and
sober
whereas
the
men
are
little
better
than
would
you
have
them
brazen
as
well
as
hoseless
a
little
affability
adorns
even
beauty
sighed
denys
then
let
these
alone
sith
they
are
not
to
your
taste
retorted
gerard
what
is
there
no
sweet
face
in
burgundy
that
would
pale
to
see
you
so
wrapped
up
in
strange
women
that
would
cry
their
eyes
well
then
but
it
is
a
long
way
to
ay
to
the
foot
but
not
to
the
heart
i
am
there
sleeping
and
waking
and
almost
every
minute
of
the
in
burgundy
why
i
thought
you
had
never
in
burgundy
cried
gerard
contemptuously
no
in
sweet
sevenbergen
ah
many
such
dialogues
as
this
passed
between
the
pair
on
the
long
and
weary
road
and
neither
could
change
the
other
one
day
about
noon
they
reached
a
town
of
some
pretensions
and
gerard
was
glad
for
he
wanted
to
buy
a
pair
of
shoes
his
own
were
quite
worn
out
they
soon
found
a
shop
that
displayed
a
goodly
array
and
made
up
to
it
and
would
have
entered
it
but
the
shopkeeper
sat
on
the
doorstep
taking
a
nap
and
was
so
fat
as
to
block
up
the
narrow
doorway
the
very
light
could
hardly
struggle
past
his
too
too
solid
flesh
much
less
a
carnal
customer
my
fair
readers
accustomed
when
they
go
shopping
to
be
met
half
way
with
nods
and
becks
and
wreathed
smiles
and
waved
into
a
seat
while
almost
at
the
same
instant
an
eager
shopman
flings
himself
half
across
the
counter
in
a
to
learn
their
commands
can
best
appreciate
this
mediaeval
teuton
who
kept
a
shop
as
a
dog
keeps
a
kennel
and
sat
at
the
exclusion
of
custom
snoring
like
a
pig
denys
and
gerard
stood
and
contemplated
this
curiosity
emblem
permit
me
to
remark
of
the
lets
and
hindrances
to
commerce
that
characterized
his
epoch
jump
over
him
the
door
is
too
march
through
him
the
man
is
too
what
is
the
coil
inquired
a
mumbling
voice
from
the
interior
apprentice
with
his
mouth
full
we
want
to
get
into
your
shop
what
for
in
heaven
name
shoon
lazy
bones
the
ire
of
the
apprentice
began
to
rise
at
such
an
explanation
and
could
ye
find
no
hour
out
of
all
the
twelve
to
come
pestering
us
for
shoon
but
the
one
little
little
hour
my
master
takes
his
nap
and
i
sit
down
to
my
dinner
when
all
the
rest
of
the
world
is
full
long
ago
denys
heard
but
could
not
follow
the
sense
waste
no
more
time
talking
their
german
gibberish
said
he
take
out
thy
knife
and
tickle
his
fat
that
i
will
not
said
gerard
then
here
goes
i
prong
him
with
gerard
seized
the
mad
fellow
arm
in
dismay
for
he
had
been
long
enough
in
the
country
to
guess
that
the
whole
town
would
take
part
in
any
brawl
with
the
native
against
a
stranger
but
denys
twisted
away
from
him
and
the
bolt
in
his
hand
was
actually
on
the
road
to
the
sleeper
ribs
but
at
that
very
moment
two
females
crossed
the
road
towards
him
he
saw
the
blissful
vision
and
instantly
forgot
what
he
was
about
and
awaited
their
approach
with
unreasonable
joy
though
companions
they
were
not
equals
except
in
attractiveness
to
a
burgundian
crossbow
man
for
one
was
very
tall
the
other
short
and
by
one
of
those
anomalies
which
society
however
primitive
speedily
establishes
the
long
one
held
up
the
little
one
tail
the
tall
one
wore
a
plain
linen
coif
on
her
head
a
little
grogram
cloak
over
her
shoulders
a
grey
kirtle
and
a
short
farthingale
or
petticoat
of
bright
red
cloth
and
feet
and
legs
quite
bare
though
her
arms
were
veiled
in
tight
linen
sleeves
the
other
a
kirtle
broadly
trimmed
with
fur
her
arms
in
double
sleeves
whereof
the
inner
of
yellow
satin
clung
to
the
skin
the
outer
all
befurred
were
open
at
the
inside
of
the
elbow
and
so
the
arm
passed
through
and
left
them
dangling
velvet
huge
purse
at
girdle
gorgeous
train
bare
legs
and
thus
they
came
on
the
citizen
wife
strutting
and
the
maid
gliding
after
holding
her
mistress
train
devoutly
in
both
hands
and
bending
and
winding
her
lithe
body
prettily
enough
to
do
it
imagine
if
not
pressed
for
time
a
bantam
with
a
guineahen
stepping
obsequious
at
its
stately
heel
this
pageant
made
straight
for
the
shoemaker
shop
denys
louted
low
the
worshipful
lady
nodded
graciously
but
rapidly
having
business
on
hand
or
rather
on
foot
for
in
a
moment
she
poked
the
point
of
her
little
shoe
into
the
sleeper
and
worked
it
round
in
him
like
a
gimlet
till
with
a
long
snarl
he
woke
the
incarnate
shutter
rising
and
grumbling
vaguely
the
lady
swept
in
and
deigned
him
no
further
notice
he
retreated
to
his
neighbour
shop
the
tailor
and
sitting
on
the
step
protected
it
from
the
impertinence
of
morning
calls
neighbours
should
be
neighbourly
denys
and
gerard
followed
the
dignity
into
the
shop
where
sat
the
apprentice
at
dinner
the
maid
stood
outside
with
her
insteps
crossed
leaning
against
the
wall
and
tapping
it
with
her
nails
those
yonder
said
the
dignity
briefly
pointing
with
an
imperious
little
white
hand
to
some
yellow
shoes
gilded
at
the
toe
while
the
apprentice
stood
stock
still
neutralized
by
his
dinner
and
his
duty
denys
sprang
at
the
shoes
and
brought
them
to
her
she
smiled
and
calmly
seating
herself
protruded
her
foot
shod
but
hoseless
and
scented
down
went
denys
on
his
knees
and
drew
off
her
shoe
and
tried
the
new
ones
on
the
white
skin
devoutly
finding
she
had
a
willing
victim
she
abused
the
opportunity
tried
first
one
pair
then
another
then
the
first
again
and
so
on
balancing
and
hesitating
for
about
half
an
hour
to
gerard
disgust
and
denys
weak
delight
at
last
she
was
fitted
and
handed
two
pair
of
yellow
and
one
pair
of
red
shoes
out
to
her
servant
then
was
heard
a
sigh
it
burst
from
the
owner
of
the
shop
he
had
risen
from
slumber
and
was
now
hovering
about
like
a
partridge
near
her
brood
in
danger
there
go
all
my
coloured
shoes
said
he
as
they
disappeared
in
the
girl
apron
the
lady
departed
gerard
fitted
himself
with
a
stout
pair
asked
the
price
paid
it
without
a
word
and
gave
his
old
ones
to
a
beggar
in
the
street
who
blessed
him
in
the
marketplace
and
threw
them
furiously
down
a
well
in
the
suburbs
the
comrades
left
the
shop
and
in
it
two
melancholy
men
that
looked
and
even
talked
as
if
they
had
been
robbed
wholesale
my
shoon
are
sore
worn
said
denys
grinding
his
teeth
but
i
go
barefoot
till
i
reach
france
ere
i
leave
my
money
with
such
churls
as
the
dutchman
replied
calmly
they
seem
indifferent
well
as
they
drew
near
the
rhine
they
passed
through
forest
after
forest
and
now
for
the
first
time
ugly
words
sounded
in
travellers
mouths
seated
around
stoves
thieves
black
gangs
etc
the
very
rustics
were
said
to
have
a
custom
hereabouts
of
murdering
the
unwary
traveller
in
these
gloomy
woods
whose
dark
and
devious
winding
enabled
those
who
were
familiar
with
them
to
do
deeds
of
rapine
and
blood
undetected
or
if
detected
easily
to
baffle
pursuit
certain
it
was
that
every
clown
they
met
carried
whether
for
offence
or
defence
a
most
formidable
weapon
a
light
axe
with
a
short
pike
at
the
head
and
a
long
slender
handle
of
ash
or
yew
well
seasoned
these
the
natives
could
all
throw
with
singular
precision
so
as
to
make
the
point
strike
an
object
at
several
yard
distance
or
could
slay
a
bullock
at
hand
with
a
stroke
of
the
blade
gerard
bought
one
and
practised
with
it
denys
quietly
filed
and
ground
his
bolt
sharp
whistling
the
whilst
and
when
they
entered
a
gloomy
wood
he
would
unsling
his
crossbow
and
carry
it
ready
for
action
but
not
so
much
like
a
traveller
fearing
an
attack
as
a
sportsman
watchful
not
to
miss
a
snap
shot
one
day
being
in
a
forest
a
few
leagues
from
dusseldorf
as
gerard
was
walking
like
one
in
a
dream
thinking
of
margaret
and
scarce
seeing
the
road
he
trode
his
companion
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
strung
his
crossbow
with
glittering
eye
hush
said
he
in
a
low
whisper
that
startled
gerard
more
than
thunder
gerard
grasped
his
axe
tight
and
shook
a
little
he
heard
a
rustling
in
the
wood
hard
by
and
at
the
same
moment
denys
sprang
into
the
wood
and
his
crossbow
went
to
his
shoulder
even
as
he
jumped
twang
went
the
metal
string
and
after
an
instant
suspense
he
roared
run
forward
guard
the
road
he
is
hit
he
is
hit
gerard
darted
forward
and
as
he
ran
a
young
bear
burst
out
of
the
wood
right
upon
him
finding
itself
intercepted
it
went
upon
its
hind
legs
with
a
snarl
and
though
not
half
grown
opened
formidable
jaws
and
long
claws
gerard
in
a
fury
of
excitement
and
agitation
flung
himself
on
it
and
delivered
a
tremendous
blow
on
its
nose
with
his
axe
and
the
creature
staggered
another
and
it
lay
grovelling
with
gerard
hacking
it
hallo
stop
you
are
mad
to
spoil
the
i
took
it
for
a
robber
said
gerard
panting
i
mean
i
had
made
ready
for
a
robber
so
i
could
not
hold
my
ay
these
chattering
travellers
have
stuffed
your
head
full
of
thieves
and
assassins
they
have
not
got
a
real
live
robber
in
their
whole
nation
nay
i
carry
the
beast
bear
thou
my
we
will
carry
it
by
turns
then
said
gerard
for
is
a
heavy
load
poor
thing
how
its
blood
drips
why
did
we
slay
it
for
supper
and
the
reward
the
baillie
of
the
next
town
shall
give
and
for
that
it
must
die
when
it
had
but
just
begun
to
live
and
perchance
it
hath
a
mother
that
will
miss
it
sore
this
night
and
loves
it
as
ours
love
us
more
than
mine
does
what
know
you
not
that
his
mother
was
caught
in
a
pitfall
last
month
and
her
skin
is
now
at
the
tanner
and
his
father
was
stuck
full
of
shafts
day
and
died
like
julius
caesar
with
his
hands
folded
on
his
bosom
and
a
dead
dog
in
each
of
them
but
gerard
would
not
view
it
jestingly
why
then
said
he
we
have
killed
one
of
god
creatures
that
was
all
alone
in
the
i
am
this
day
in
this
strange
you
young
milksop
roared
denys
these
things
must
not
be
looked
at
so
or
not
another
bow
would
be
drawn
nor
quarrel
fly
in
forest
nor
battlefield
why
one
of
your
kidney
consorting
with
a
troop
of
pikemen
should
turn
them
to
a
row
of
it
is
ended
to
rome
thou
goest
not
alone
for
never
wouldst
thou
reach
the
alps
in
a
whole
skin
i
take
thee
to
remiremont
my
native
place
and
there
i
marry
thee
to
my
young
sister
she
is
blooming
as
a
peach
thou
shakest
thy
head
ah
i
forgot
thou
lovest
elsewhere
and
art
a
one
woman
man
a
creature
to
me
scarce
conceivable
well
then
i
shall
find
thee
not
a
wife
nor
a
leman
but
a
friend
some
honest
burgundian
who
shall
go
with
thee
as
far
as
lyons
and
much
i
doubt
that
honest
fellow
will
be
myself
into
whose
liquor
thou
has
dropped
sundry
powders
to
make
me
love
thee
for
erst
i
endured
not
doves
in
doublet
and
hose
from
lyons
i
say
i
can
trust
thee
by
ship
to
italy
which
being
by
all
accounts
the
very
stronghold
of
milksops
thou
wilt
there
be
safe
they
will
hear
thy
words
and
make
thee
their
duke
in
a
gerard
sighed
in
sooth
i
love
not
to
think
of
this
dusseldorf
where
we
are
to
part
company
good
they
walked
silently
each
thinking
of
the
separation
at
hand
the
thought
checked
trifling
conversation
and
at
these
moments
it
is
a
relief
to
do
something
however
insignificant
gerard
asked
denys
to
lend
him
a
bolt
i
have
often
shot
with
a
long
bow
but
never
with
one
of
these
draw
thy
knife
and
cut
this
one
out
of
the
cub
said
denys
slily
nay
day
i
want
a
clean
denys
gave
him
three
out
of
his
quiver
gerard
strung
the
bow
and
levelled
it
at
a
bough
that
had
fallen
into
the
road
at
some
distance
the
power
of
the
instrument
surprised
him
the
short
but
thick
steel
bow
jarred
him
to
the
very
heel
as
it
went
off
and
the
swift
steel
shaft
was
invisible
in
its
passage
only
the
dead
leaves
with
which
november
had
carpeted
the
narrow
road
flew
about
on
the
other
side
of
the
bough
ye
aimed
a
thought
too
high
said
denys
what
a
deadly
thing
no
wonder
it
is
driving
out
the
longbow
to
martin
much
ay
lad
said
denys
triumphantly
it
gains
ground
every
day
in
spite
of
their
laws
and
their
proclamations
to
keep
up
the
yewen
bow
because
forsooth
their
grandsires
shot
with
it
knowing
no
better
you
see
gerard
war
is
not
pastime
men
will
shoot
at
their
enemies
with
the
hittingest
arm
and
the
killingest
not
with
the
longest
and
then
these
new
engines
i
hear
of
will
put
both
bows
down
for
these
with
a
pinch
of
black
dust
and
a
leaden
ball
and
a
child
finger
shall
slay
you
mars
and
goliath
and
the
seven
pooh
pooh
said
denys
warmly
petrone
nor
harquebuss
shall
ever
put
down
sir
arbalest
why
we
can
shoot
ten
times
while
they
are
putting
their
charcoal
and
their
lead
into
their
leathern
smoke
belchers
and
then
kindling
their
matches
all
that
is
too
fumbling
for
the
field
of
battle
there
a
soldier
weapon
needs
be
aye
ready
like
his
gerard
did
not
answer
for
his
ear
was
attracted
by
a
sound
behind
them
it
was
a
peculiar
sound
too
like
something
heavy
but
not
hard
rushing
softly
over
the
dead
leaves
he
turned
round
with
some
little
curiosity
a
colossal
creature
was
coming
down
the
road
at
about
sixty
paces
distance
he
looked
at
it
in
a
sort
of
calm
stupor
at
first
but
the
next
moment
he
turned
ashy
pale
denys
he
cried
oh
god
denys
denys
whirled
round
it
was
a
bear
as
big
as
a
it
was
tearing
along
with
its
huge
head
down
running
on
a
hot
scent
the
very
moment
he
saw
it
denys
said
in
a
sickening
whisper
the
cub
oh
the
concentrated
horror
of
that
one
word
whispered
hoarsely
with
dilating
eyes
for
in
that
syllable
it
all
flashed
upon
them
both
like
a
sudden
stroke
of
lightning
in
the
dark
the
bloody
trail
the
murdered
cub
the
mother
upon
them
and
it
death
all
this
in
a
moment
of
time
the
next
she
saw
them
huge
as
she
was
she
seemed
to
double
herself
it
was
her
long
hair
bristling
with
rage
she
raised
her
head
big
as
a
hull
her
jaws
opened
wide
at
them
her
eyes
turned
to
blood
and
flame
and
she
rushed
upon
them
scattering
the
leaves
about
her
like
a
whirlwind
as
she
came
shoot
screamed
denys
but
gerard
stood
shaking
from
head
to
foot
useless
shoot
man
ten
thousand
devils
shoot
too
late
tree
tree
and
he
dropped
the
cub
pushed
gerard
across
the
road
and
flew
to
the
first
tree
and
climbed
it
gerard
the
same
on
his
side
and
as
they
fled
both
men
uttered
inhuman
howls
like
savage
creatures
grazed
by
death
with
all
their
speed
one
or
other
would
have
been
torn
to
fragments
at
the
foot
of
his
tree
but
the
bear
stopped
a
moment
at
the
cub
without
taking
her
bloodshot
eyes
off
those
she
was
hunting
she
smelt
it
all
round
and
found
how
her
creator
only
knows
that
it
was
dead
quite
dead
she
gave
a
yell
such
as
neither
of
the
hunted
ones
had
ever
heard
nor
dreamed
to
be
in
nature
and
flew
after
denys
she
reared
and
struck
at
him
as
he
climbed
he
was
just
out
of
reach
instantly
she
seized
the
tree
and
with
her
huge
teeth
tore
a
great
piece
out
of
it
with
a
crash
then
she
reared
again
dug
her
claws
deep
into
the
bark
and
began
to
mount
it
slowly
but
as
surely
as
a
monkey
denys
evil
star
had
led
him
to
a
dead
tree
a
mere
shaft
and
of
no
very
great
height
he
climbed
faster
than
his
pursuer
and
was
soon
at
the
top
he
looked
this
way
and
that
for
some
bough
of
another
tree
to
spring
to
there
was
none
and
if
he
jumped
down
he
knew
the
bear
would
be
upon
him
ere
he
could
recover
the
fall
and
make
short
work
of
him
moreover
denys
was
little
used
to
turning
his
back
on
danger
and
his
blood
was
rising
at
being
hunted
he
turned
to
bay
my
hour
is
come
thought
he
let
me
meet
death
like
a
he
kneeled
down
and
grasped
a
small
shoot
to
steady
himself
drew
his
long
knife
and
clenching
his
teeth
prepared
to
jab
the
huge
brute
as
soon
as
it
should
mount
within
reach
of
this
combat
the
result
was
not
doubtful
the
monster
head
and
neck
were
scarce
vulnerable
for
bone
and
masses
of
hair
the
man
was
going
to
sting
the
bear
and
the
bear
to
crack
the
man
like
a
nut
gerard
heart
was
better
than
his
nerves
he
saw
his
friend
mortal
danger
and
passed
at
once
from
fear
to
blindish
rage
he
slipped
down
his
tree
in
a
moment
caught
up
the
crossbow
which
he
had
dropped
in
the
road
and
running
furiously
up
sent
a
bolt
into
the
bear
body
with
a
loud
shout
the
bear
gave
a
snarl
of
rage
and
pain
and
turned
its
head
irresolutely
keep
aloof
cried
denys
or
you
are
a
dead
i
care
not
and
in
a
moment
he
had
another
bolt
ready
and
shot
it
fiercely
into
the
bear
screaming
take
that
take
that
denys
poured
a
volley
of
oaths
down
at
him
get
away
idiot
he
was
right
the
bear
finding
so
formidable
and
noisy
a
foe
behind
her
slipped
growling
down
the
tree
rending
deep
furrows
in
it
as
she
slipped
gerard
ran
back
to
his
tree
and
climbed
it
swiftly
but
while
his
legs
were
dangling
some
eight
feet
from
the
ground
the
bear
came
rearing
and
struck
with
her
fore
paw
and
out
flew
a
piece
of
bloody
cloth
from
gerard
hose
he
climbed
and
climbed
and
presently
he
heard
as
it
were
in
the
air
a
voice
say
go
out
on
the
bough
he
looked
and
there
was
a
long
massive
branch
before
him
shooting
upwards
at
a
slight
angle
he
threw
his
body
across
it
and
by
a
series
of
convulsive
efforts
worked
up
it
to
the
end
then
he
looked
round
panting
the
bear
was
mounting
the
tree
on
the
other
side
he
heard
her
claws
scrape
and
saw
her
bulge
on
both
sides
of
the
massive
tree
her
eye
not
being
very
quick
she
reached
the
fork
and
passed
it
mounting
the
main
stem
gerard
drew
breath
more
freely
the
bear
either
heard
him
or
found
by
scent
she
was
wrong
she
paused
presently
she
caught
sight
of
him
she
eyed
him
steadily
then
quietly
descended
to
the
fork
slowly
and
cautiously
she
stretched
out
a
paw
and
tried
the
bough
it
was
a
stiff
oak
branch
sound
as
iron
instinct
taught
the
creature
this
it
crawled
carefully
out
on
the
bough
growling
savagely
as
it
came
gerard
looked
wildly
down
he
was
forty
feet
from
the
ground
death
below
death
moving
slow
but
sure
on
him
in
a
still
more
horrible
form
his
hair
bristled
the
sweat
poured
from
him
he
sat
helpless
fascinated
as
the
fearful
monster
crawled
growling
towards
him
incongruous
thoughts
coursed
through
his
mind
margaret
the
vulgate
where
it
speaks
of
the
rage
of
a
robbed
of
her
whelps
rome
eternity
the
bear
crawled
on
and
now
the
stupor
of
death
fell
on
the
doomed
man
he
saw
the
open
jaws
and
bloodshot
eyes
coming
but
in
a
mist
as
in
a
mist
he
heard
a
twang
he
glanced
down
denys
white
and
silent
as
death
was
shooting
up
at
the
bear
the
bear
snarled
at
the
twang
but
crawled
on
again
the
crossbow
twanged
and
the
bear
snarled
and
came
nearer
again
the
cross
bow
twanged
and
the
next
moment
the
bear
was
close
upon
gerard
where
he
sat
with
hair
standing
stiff
on
end
and
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
palsied
the
bear
opened
her
jaws
like
a
grave
and
hot
blood
spouted
from
them
upon
gerard
as
from
a
pump
the
bough
rocked
the
wounded
monster
was
reeling
it
clung
it
stuck
its
sickles
of
claws
deep
into
the
wood
it
toppled
its
claws
held
firm
but
its
body
rolled
off
and
the
sudden
shock
to
the
branch
shook
gerard
forward
on
his
stomach
with
his
face
upon
one
of
the
bear
straining
paws
at
this
by
a
convulsive
effort
she
raised
her
head
up
up
till
he
felt
her
hot
fetid
breath
then
huge
teeth
snapped
together
loudly
close
below
him
in
the
air
with
a
last
effort
of
baffled
hate
the
ponderous
carcass
rent
the
claws
out
of
the
bough
then
pounded
the
earth
with
a
tremendous
thump
there
was
a
shout
of
triumph
below
and
the
very
next
instant
a
cry
of
dismay
for
gerard
had
swooned
and
without
an
attempt
to
save
himself
rolled
headlong
from
the
perilous
height
chapter
xxv
denys
caught
at
gerard
and
somewhat
checked
his
fall
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
this
alone
would
have
saved
him
from
breaking
his
neck
or
a
limb
his
best
friend
now
was
the
dying
bear
on
whose
hairy
carcass
his
head
and
shoulders
descended
denys
tore
him
off
her
it
was
needless
she
panted
still
and
her
limbs
quivered
but
a
hare
was
not
so
harmless
and
soon
she
breathed
her
last
and
the
judicious
denys
propped
gerard
up
against
her
being
soft
and
fanned
him
he
came
to
by
degrees
but
confused
and
feeling
the
bear
around
him
rolled
away
yelling
courage
cried
denys
le
diable
est
is
it
dead
quite
dead
inquired
gerard
from
behind
a
tree
for
his
courage
was
feverish
and
the
cold
fit
was
on
him
just
now
and
had
been
for
some
time
behold
said
denys
and
pulled
the
brute
ear
playfully
and
opened
her
jaws
and
put
in
his
head
with
other
insulting
antics
in
the
midst
of
which
gerard
was
violently
sick
denys
laughed
at
him
what
is
the
matter
now
said
he
also
why
tumble
off
your
perch
just
when
we
had
won
the
day
i
swooned
i
but
why
not
receiving
an
answer
he
continued
green
girls
faint
as
soon
as
look
at
you
but
then
they
choose
time
and
place
what
woman
ever
fainted
up
a
tree
she
sent
her
nasty
blood
all
over
me
i
think
the
smell
must
have
overpowered
me
faugh
i
hate
i
do
believe
it
see
what
a
mess
she
has
made
me
but
with
her
blood
not
yours
i
pity
the
enemy
that
strives
to
satisfy
you
need
not
to
brag
maitre
denys
i
saw
you
under
the
tree
the
colour
of
your
let
us
distinguish
said
denys
colouring
it
is
permitted
to
tremble
for
a
gerard
for
answer
flung
his
arms
round
denys
neck
in
silence
look
here
whined
the
stout
soldier
affected
by
this
little
gush
of
nature
and
youth
was
ever
aught
so
like
a
woman
i
love
thee
little
milksop
go
to
good
behold
him
on
his
knees
now
what
new
caprice
is
this
oh
denys
ought
we
not
to
return
thanks
to
him
who
has
saved
both
our
lives
against
such
fearful
odds
and
gerard
kneeled
and
prayed
aloud
and
presently
he
found
denys
kneeling
quiet
beside
him
with
his
hands
across
his
bosom
after
the
custom
of
his
nation
and
a
face
as
long
as
his
arm
when
they
rose
gerard
countenance
was
beaming
good
denys
said
he
heaven
will
reward
thy
ah
bah
i
did
it
out
of
politeness
said
the
frenchman
it
was
to
please
thee
little
one
egal
was
well
and
orderly
prayed
and
edified
me
to
the
core
while
it
lasted
a
bishop
had
scarce
handled
the
matter
better
so
now
our
evensong
being
sung
and
the
saints
enlisted
with
us
ere
they
had
taken
two
steps
he
stopped
the
cub
oh
no
no
cried
gerard
you
are
right
it
is
late
we
have
lost
time
climbing
trees
and
tumbling
off
and
swooning
and
vomiting
and
praying
and
the
brute
is
heavy
to
carry
and
now
i
think
o
we
shall
have
papa
after
it
next
these
bears
make
such
a
coil
about
an
odd
cub
what
is
this
you
are
wounded
you
are
wounded
not
he
is
wounded
miserable
that
i
am
be
calm
denys
i
am
not
touched
i
feel
no
pain
you
you
only
feel
when
another
is
hurt
cried
denys
with
great
emotion
and
throwing
himself
on
his
knees
he
examined
gerard
leg
with
glistening
eyes
quick
quick
before
it
stiffens
he
cried
and
hurried
him
on
who
makes
the
coil
about
nothing
now
inquired
gerard
composedly
denys
reply
was
a
very
indirect
one
be
pleased
to
note
said
he
that
i
have
a
bad
heart
you
were
man
enough
to
save
my
life
yet
i
must
sneer
at
you
a
novice
in
war
was
not
i
a
novice
once
myself
then
you
fainted
from
a
wound
and
i
thought
you
swooned
for
fear
and
called
you
a
milksop
briefly
i
have
a
bad
tongue
and
a
bad
denys
you
you
are
very
good
to
say
so
little
one
and
i
am
eternally
obliged
to
you
mumbled
the
remorseful
denys
ere
they
had
walked
many
furlongs
the
muscles
of
the
wounded
leg
contracted
and
stiffened
till
presently
gerard
could
only
just
put
his
toe
to
the
ground
and
that
with
great
pain
at
last
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
let
me
lie
down
and
die
he
groaned
for
this
is
denys
represented
that
it
was
afternoon
and
the
nights
were
now
frosty
and
cold
and
hunger
ill
companions
and
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
lose
heart
a
certain
great
personage
being
notoriously
defunct
so
gerard
leaned
upon
his
axe
and
hobbled
on
but
presently
he
gave
in
all
of
a
sudden
and
sank
helpless
in
the
road
denys
drew
him
aside
into
the
wood
and
to
his
surprise
gave
him
his
crossbow
and
bolts
enjoining
him
strictly
to
lie
quiet
and
if
any
fellows
should
find
him
out
and
come
to
him
to
bid
them
keep
aloof
and
should
they
refuse
to
shoot
them
dead
at
twenty
paces
honest
men
keep
the
path
and
knaves
in
a
wood
none
but
fools
do
parley
with
with
this
he
snatched
up
gerard
axe
and
set
off
running
not
as
gerard
expected
towards
dusseldorf
but
on
the
road
they
had
come
gerard
lay
aching
and
smarting
and
to
him
rome
that
seemed
so
near
at
starting
looked
far
far
off
now
that
he
was
two
hundred
miles
nearer
it
but
soon
all
his
thoughts
turned
how
sweet
it
would
be
one
day
to
hold
margaret
hand
and
tell
her
all
he
had
gone
through
for
her
the
very
thought
of
it
and
her
soothed
him
and
in
the
midst
of
pain
and
irritation
of
the
nerves
be
lay
resigned
and
sweetly
though
faintly
smiling
he
had
lain
thus
more
than
two
hours
when
suddenly
there
were
shouts
and
the
next
moment
something
struck
a
tree
hard
by
and
quivered
in
it
he
looked
it
was
an
arrow
he
started
to
his
feet
several
missiles
rattled
among
the
boughs
and
the
wood
echoed
with
whence
they
came
he
could
not
tell
for
noises
in
these
huge
woods
are
so
reverberated
that
a
stranger
is
always
at
fault
as
to
their
whereabout
but
they
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
air
presently
there
was
a
lull
then
he
heard
the
fierce
galloping
of
hoofs
and
still
louder
shouts
and
cries
arose
mingled
with
shrieks
and
groans
and
above
all
strange
and
terrible
sounds
like
fierce
claps
of
thunder
bellowing
loud
and
then
dying
off
in
cracking
echoes
and
red
tongues
of
flame
shot
out
ever
and
anon
among
the
trees
and
clouds
of
sulphurous
smoke
came
drifting
over
his
head
and
all
was
still
gerard
was
struck
with
awe
what
will
become
of
denys
he
cried
oh
why
did
you
leave
me
oh
denys
my
friend
my
friend
just
before
sunset
denys
returned
almost
sinking
under
a
hairy
bundle
it
was
the
bear
skin
gerard
welcomed
him
with
a
burst
of
joy
that
astonished
him
i
thought
never
to
see
you
again
dear
denys
were
you
in
the
battle
no
what
battle
the
bloody
battle
of
men
or
fiends
that
raged
in
the
wood
a
while
agone
and
with
this
he
described
it
to
the
life
and
more
fully
than
i
have
done
denys
patted
him
indulgently
on
the
back
it
is
well
said
he
thou
art
a
good
limner
and
fever
is
a
great
spur
to
the
imagination
one
day
i
lay
in
a
with
a
cracked
skull
and
saw
two
hosts
manoeuvre
and
fight
a
good
hour
on
eight
feet
square
the
which
i
did
fairly
describe
to
my
comrade
in
due
order
only
not
so
gorgeously
as
thou
for
want
of
book
learning
what
then
you
believe
me
not
when
i
tell
you
the
arrows
whizzed
over
my
head
and
the
combatants
shouted
and
may
the
foul
fiends
fly
away
with
me
if
i
believe
a
word
of
gerard
took
his
arm
and
quietly
pointed
to
a
tree
close
by
why
it
looks
like
it
broad
arrow
as
i
live
and
he
went
close
and
looked
up
at
it
it
came
out
of
the
battle
i
heard
it
and
saw
an
english
how
know
you
that
marry
by
its
length
the
english
bowmen
draw
the
bow
to
the
ear
others
only
to
the
right
breast
hence
the
english
loose
a
shaft
and
this
is
one
of
them
perdition
seize
them
well
if
this
is
not
glamour
there
has
been
a
trifle
of
a
battle
and
if
there
has
been
a
battle
in
so
ridiculous
a
place
for
a
battle
as
this
why
then
is
no
business
of
mine
for
my
duke
hath
no
quarrel
hereabouts
so
let
to
bed
said
the
professional
and
with
this
he
scraped
together
a
heap
of
leaves
and
made
gerard
lie
on
it
his
axe
by
his
side
he
then
lay
down
beside
him
with
one
hand
on
his
arbalest
and
drew
the
over
them
hair
inward
they
were
soon
as
warm
as
toast
and
fast
asleep
but
long
before
the
dawn
gerard
woke
his
comrade
what
shall
i
do
denys
i
die
of
famine
do
why
go
to
sleep
again
incontinent
qui
dort
but
i
tell
you
i
am
too
hungry
to
sleep
snapped
gerard
let
us
march
then
replied
denys
with
paternal
indulgence
he
had
a
brief
paroxysm
of
yawns
then
made
a
small
bundle
of
ears
rolling
them
up
in
a
strip
of
the
skin
cut
for
the
purpose
and
they
took
the
road
gerard
leaned
on
his
axe
and
propped
by
denys
on
the
other
side
hobbled
along
not
without
sighs
i
hate
said
gerard
viciously
therein
you
show
judgment
replied
papa
smoothly
it
was
a
clear
starlight
night
and
soon
the
moon
rising
revealed
the
end
of
the
wood
at
no
great
distance
a
pleasant
sight
since
dusseldorf
they
knew
was
but
a
short
league
further
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
they
came
upon
something
so
mysterious
that
they
stopped
to
gaze
at
it
before
going
up
to
it
two
white
pillars
rose
in
the
air
distant
a
few
paces
from
each
other
and
between
them
stood
many
figures
that
looked
like
human
forms
i
go
no
farther
till
i
know
what
this
is
said
gerard
in
an
agitated
whisper
are
they
effigies
of
the
saints
for
men
to
pray
to
on
the
road
or
live
robbers
waiting
to
shoot
down
honest
travellers
nay
living
men
they
can
not
be
for
they
stand
on
nothing
that
i
see
oh
denys
let
us
turn
back
till
daybreak
this
is
no
mortal
denys
halted
and
peered
long
and
keenly
they
are
men
said
he
at
last
gerard
was
for
turning
back
all
the
more
but
men
that
will
never
hurt
us
nor
we
them
look
not
to
their
feet
for
that
they
stand
on
where
then
i
the
name
of
all
the
saints
look
over
their
heads
said
denys
gravely
following
this
direction
gerard
presently
discerned
the
outline
of
a
dark
wooden
beam
passing
from
pillar
to
pillar
and
as
the
pair
got
nearer
walking
now
on
tiptoe
one
by
one
dark
cords
came
out
in
the
moonlight
each
pendent
from
the
beam
to
a
dead
man
and
tight
as
wire
now
as
they
came
under
this
awful
monument
of
crime
and
wholesale
vengeance
a
light
air
swept
by
and
several
of
the
corpses
swung
or
gently
gyrated
and
every
rope
creaked
gerard
shuddered
at
this
ghastly
salute
so
thoroughly
had
the
gibbet
with
its
sickening
load
seized
and
held
their
eyes
that
it
was
but
now
they
perceived
a
fire
right
underneath
and
a
living
figure
sitting
huddled
over
it
his
axe
lay
beside
him
the
bright
blade
shining
red
in
the
glow
he
was
asleep
gerard
started
but
denys
only
whispered
courage
comrade
here
is
a
ay
but
there
is
a
man
at
there
will
soon
be
three
and
he
began
to
heap
some
wood
on
it
that
the
watcher
had
prepared
during
which
the
prudent
gerard
seized
the
man
axe
and
sat
down
tight
on
it
grasping
his
own
and
examining
the
sleeper
there
was
nothing
outwardly
distinctive
in
the
man
he
wore
the
dress
of
the
country
folk
and
the
hat
of
the
district
a
hat
called
a
brunswicker
stiff
enough
to
turn
a
sword
cut
and
with
a
thick
brass
the
weight
of
the
whole
thing
had
turned
his
ears
entirely
down
like
a
fancy
rabbit
in
our
century
but
even
this
though
it
spoiled
him
as
a
man
was
nothing
remarkable
they
had
of
late
met
scores
of
these
rustics
the
peculiarity
was
this
clown
watching
under
a
laden
gallows
what
for
denys
if
he
felt
curious
would
not
show
it
he
took
out
two
ears
from
his
bundle
and
running
sticks
through
them
began
to
toast
them
be
eating
coined
money
said
he
for
the
burgomaster
of
dusseldorf
had
given
us
a
for
these
ears
as
proving
the
death
of
their
owners
but
better
a
lean
purse
than
a
lere
unhappy
man
cried
gerard
could
you
eat
food
here
where
the
fire
is
lighted
there
must
the
meat
roast
and
where
it
roasts
there
must
it
be
eaten
for
nought
travels
worse
than
your
roasted
well
eat
thou
denys
an
thou
canst
but
i
am
cold
and
sick
there
is
no
room
for
hunger
in
my
heart
after
what
mine
eyes
have
seen
and
he
shuddered
over
the
fire
oh
how
they
creak
and
who
is
this
man
i
wonder
what
an
churl
denys
examined
him
like
a
connoisseur
looking
at
a
picture
and
in
due
course
delivered
judgment
i
take
him
to
be
of
the
refuse
of
that
company
whereof
these
pointing
carelessly
upward
were
the
cream
and
so
ran
their
heads
into
danger
at
that
rate
why
not
stun
him
before
he
wakes
and
gerard
fidgeted
where
he
sat
denys
opened
his
eyes
with
humorous
surprise
for
one
who
sets
up
for
a
milksop
you
have
the
readiest
hand
why
should
two
stun
one
tush
he
wakes
note
now
what
he
says
at
waking
and
tell
these
last
words
were
hardly
whispered
when
the
watcher
opened
his
eyes
at
sight
of
the
fire
made
up
and
two
strangers
eyeing
him
keenly
he
stared
and
there
was
a
severe
and
pretty
successful
effort
to
be
calm
still
a
perceptible
tremor
ran
all
over
him
soon
he
manned
himself
and
said
gruffly
good
morrow
but
at
the
very
moment
of
saying
it
he
missed
his
axe
and
saw
how
gerard
was
sitting
upon
it
with
his
own
laid
ready
to
his
hand
he
lost
countenance
again
directly
denys
smiled
grimly
at
this
bit
of
byplay
good
morrow
said
gerard
quietly
keeping
his
eye
on
him
the
watcher
was
now
too
ill
at
ease
to
be
silent
you
make
free
with
my
fire
said
he
but
he
added
in
a
somewhat
faltering
voice
you
are
denys
whispered
gerard
the
watcher
eyed
them
askant
my
comrade
says
sith
we
share
your
fire
you
shall
share
his
so
be
it
said
the
man
warmly
i
have
half
a
kid
hanging
on
a
bush
hard
by
i
go
fetch
it
and
he
arose
with
a
cheerful
and
obliging
countenance
and
was
retiring
denys
caught
up
his
crossbow
and
levelled
it
at
his
head
the
man
fell
on
his
knees
denys
lowered
his
weapon
and
pointed
him
back
to
his
place
he
rose
and
went
back
slowly
and
unsteadily
like
one
disjointed
and
sick
at
heart
as
the
mouse
that
the
cat
lets
go
a
little
way
and
then
darts
and
replaces
sit
down
friend
said
denys
grimly
in
french
the
man
obeyed
finger
and
tone
though
he
knew
not
a
word
of
french
tell
him
the
fire
is
not
big
enough
for
more
than
thee
he
will
take
my
this
being
communicated
by
gerard
the
man
grinned
ever
since
denys
spoke
he
had
seemed
greatly
relieved
i
wist
not
ye
were
strangers
said
he
to
gerard
denys
cut
a
piece
of
bear
ear
and
offered
it
with
grace
to
him
he
had
just
levelled
crossbow
at
he
took
it
calmly
and
drew
a
piece
of
bread
from
his
wallet
and
divided
it
with
the
pair
nay
more
he
winked
and
thrust
his
hand
into
the
heap
of
leaves
he
sat
on
gerard
grasped
his
axe
ready
to
brain
him
and
produced
a
leathern
bottle
holding
full
two
gallons
he
put
it
to
his
mouth
and
drank
their
healths
then
handed
it
to
gerard
he
passed
it
untouched
to
denys
mort
de
ma
vie
cried
the
soldier
it
is
rhenish
wine
and
fit
for
the
gullet
of
an
archbishop
here
to
thee
thou
prince
of
good
fellows
wishing
thee
a
short
life
and
a
merry
one
come
gerard
sup
sup
pshaw
never
heed
them
man
they
heed
not
thee
natheless
did
i
hang
over
such
a
skin
of
rhenish
as
this
and
three
churls
sat
beneath
a
drinking
it
and
offered
me
not
a
drop
i
soon
be
down
among
denys
denys
my
spirit
would
cut
the
cord
and
womp
would
come
my
body
amongst
ye
with
a
hand
on
the
bottle
and
one
eye
winking
gerard
started
up
with
a
cry
of
horror
and
his
fingers
to
his
ears
and
was
running
from
the
place
when
his
eye
fell
on
the
watcher
axe
the
tangible
danger
brought
him
back
he
sat
down
again
on
the
axe
with
his
fingers
in
his
ears
courage
le
diable
est
mort
shouted
denys
gaily
and
offered
him
a
piece
of
bear
ear
put
it
right
under
his
nose
as
he
stopped
his
ears
gerard
turned
his
head
away
with
loathing
wine
he
gasped
heaven
knows
i
have
much
need
of
it
with
such
companions
as
thee
and
he
took
a
long
draught
of
the
rhenish
wine
it
ran
glowing
through
his
veins
and
warmed
and
strengthened
his
heart
but
could
not
check
his
tremors
whenever
a
gust
of
wind
came
as
for
denys
and
the
other
they
feasted
recklessly
and
plied
the
bottle
unceasingly
and
drank
healths
and
caroused
beneath
that
creaking
sepulchre
and
its
ghastly
tenants
ask
him
how
they
came
here
said
denys
with
his
mouth
full
and
pointing
up
without
looking
on
this
question
being
interpreted
to
the
watcher
he
replied
that
treason
had
been
their
end
diabolical
treason
and
he
then
being
rendered
communicative
by
drink
delivered
a
long
prosy
narrative
the
purport
of
which
was
as
follows
these
honest
gentlemen
who
now
dangled
here
so
miserably
were
all
stout
men
and
true
and
lived
in
the
forest
by
their
wits
their
independence
and
thriving
state
excited
the
jealousy
and
hatred
of
a
large
portion
of
mankind
and
many
attempts
were
made
on
their
lives
and
liberties
these
the
virgin
and
their
patron
saints
coupled
with
their
individual
skill
and
courage
constantly
baffled
but
yester
eve
a
party
of
merchants
came
slowly
on
their
mules
from
dusseldorf
the
honest
men
saw
them
crawling
and
let
them
penetrate
near
a
league
into
the
forest
then
set
upon
them
to
make
them
disgorge
a
portion
of
their
gains
but
alas
the
merchants
were
no
merchants
at
all
but
soldiers
of
more
than
one
nation
in
the
pay
of
the
archbishop
of
cologne
haubergeons
had
they
beneath
their
gowns
and
weapons
of
all
sorts
at
hand
natheless
the
honest
men
fought
stoutly
and
pressed
the
traitors
hard
when
lo
horsemen
that
had
been
planted
in
ambush
many
hours
before
galloped
up
and
with
these
new
diabolical
engines
of
war
shot
leaden
bullets
and
laid
many
an
honest
fellow
low
and
so
quelled
the
courage
of
others
that
they
yielded
them
prisoners
these
being
taken
the
victors
who
with
malice
inconceivable
had
brought
cords
knotted
round
their
waists
did
speedily
hang
and
by
their
side
the
dead
ones
to
make
the
gallanter
show
that
one
at
the
end
was
the
captain
he
never
felt
the
cord
he
was
riddled
with
broad
arrows
and
leaden
balls
or
ever
they
could
take
him
a
worthy
man
as
ever
cried
and
deliver
but
a
little
hasty
not
much
stay
i
forgot
he
is
dead
very
hasty
and
obstinate
as
a
pig
that
one
in
the
buff
jerkin
is
the
lieutenant
as
good
a
soul
as
ever
lived
he
was
hanged
alive
this
one
here
i
never
could
abide
no
not
that
one
that
is
conrad
my
bosom
friend
i
mean
this
one
right
overhead
in
the
shoon
you
were
always
carrying
tales
ye
thief
and
making
mischief
you
know
you
were
and
sirs
i
am
a
man

so
he
went
down
the
whole
string
indicating
with
the
neck
of
the
bottle
like
a
showman
with
his
pole
and
giving
a
neat
description
of
each
which
though
pithy
was
invariably
false
for
the
showman
had
no
real
eye
for

and
had
misunderstood

he
saw
in

that
resistance
would
be

he
submitted

in

strange
and
mixed
attitude
of
tender

deadly
suspicion
the

did
walk
i
wish
i
could
draw

would
not

pen
the
light
of
the
at
dusseldorf
was
visible
as
soon
as
they
cleared
the
wood
and
cheered
gerard
when
after
an
hour
march
the
black
outline
of
the
tower
itself
and
other
buildings
stood
out
clear
to
the
eye
their
companion
halted
and
said
gloomily
you
may
as
well
slay
me
out
of
hand
as
take
me
any
nearer
the
gates
of
dusseldorf
on
this
being
communicated
to
denys
he
said
at
once
let
him
go
then
for
in
sooth
his
neck
will
be
in
jeopardy
if
he
wends
much
further
with
gerard
acquiesced
as
a
matter
of
course
his
horror
of
a
criminal
did
not
in
the
least
dispose
him
to
active
with
the
law
but
the
fact
is
that
at
this
epoch
no
private
citizen
in
any
part
of
europe
ever
meddled
with
criminals
but
in
except
in
england
which
behind
other
nations
in
some
things
was
centuries
before
them
all
in
this
the
man
personal
liberty
being
restored
he
asked
for
his
axe
it
was
given
him
to
the
friends
surprise
he
still
lingered
was
he
to
have
nothing
for
coming
so
far
out
of
his
way
with
them
here
are
two
batzen
friend
add
the

the
good
rhenish
did
you
give
aught
for
it
ay
the
peril
of
my

say
you

i
say
it
was
worth
its

who

doubtless
be
there
in

the
man
took
the
coins
but
still
lingered
well
what
now
cried
gerard
who
thought
him
shamefully
overpaid
already
dost
seek
the
hide
off
our
bones
nay
good
sirs
but
you
have
seen
how
parlous
a
life
is
mine
ye
be
true
men
and
your
prayers
avail
give
me
then
a
small
trifle
of
a
prayer
a
please
you
for
i
know
not
gerard
choler
began
to
rise
at
the
egotistical
rogue
moreover
ever
since
his
wound
he
had
felt
gusts
of
irritability
however
he
bit
his
lip
and
said
there
go
two
words
to
that
bargain
tell
me
first
is
it
true
what
men
say
of
you
rhenish
thieves
that
ye
do
murder
innocent
and
unresisting
travellers
as
well
as
rob
them
the
other
answered
sulkily
they
you
call
thieves
are
not
to
blame
for
that
the
fault
lies
with
the
gramercy
so
is
the
law
fault
that
ill
men
break
it
i
mean
not
so
but
the
law
in
this
land
slays
an
honest
man
an
if
he
do
but
steal
what
follows
he
would
be
pitiful
but
is
discouraged
herefrom
pity
gains
him
no
pity
and
doubles
his
peril
an
he
but
cut
a
purse
his
life
is
forfeit
therefore
cutteth
he
the
throat
to
boot
to
save
his
own
neck
dead
men
tell
no
tales
pray
then
for
the
poor
soul
who
by
bloody
laws
is
driven
to
kill
or
else
be
slaughtered
were
there
less
of
this
unreasonable
gibbeting
on
the
highroad
there
should
be
less
enforced
cutting
of
throats
in
dark
woods
my
fewer
words
had
served
replied
gerard
coldly
i
asked
a
question
i
am
answered
and
suddenly
doffing
his
bonnet

and
so
good
the
greedy
outlaw
was
satisfied
last
that
is
latin
he
muttered
and
more
than
i
bargained
so
indeed
it
was
and
he
returned
to
his
business
with
a
mind
at
ease
the
friends
pondered
in
silence
the
many
events
of
the
last
few
hours
at
last
gerard
said
thoughtfully
that
saved
both
our
god
like
enough
replied
denys
and
talking
of
that
it
was
lucky
we
did
not
dawdle
over
our
what
mean
you
i
mean
they
are
not
all
hanged
i
saw
a
refuse
of
seven
or
eight
as
black
as
ink
around
our
when
when
ere
we
had
left
it
five
good
heavens
and
you
said
not
a
it
would
but
have
worried
you
and
had
set
our
friend
a
looking
back
and
mayhap
tempted
him
to
get
his
skull
split
all
other
danger
was
over
they
could
not
see
us
we
were
out
of
the
moonshine
and
indeed
just
turning
a
corner
ah
there
is
the
sun
and
here
are
the
gates
of
dusseldorf
courage
le
diable

mort
my
head
my
head
was
all
poor
gerard
could
reply
so
many
shocks
emotions
perils
horrors
added
to
the
wound
his
first
had
tried
his
youthful
body
and
sensitive
nature
too
severely
it
was
noon
of
the
same
day
in
a
bedroom
of
the
silver
lion
the
rugged
denys
sat
anxious
watching
his
young
friend
and
he
lay
raging
with
fever
delirious
at
intervals
and
one
word
for
ever
on
his
lips
margaret
margaret
margaret
chapter
xxvi
it
was
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
gerard
was
no
longer
lightheaded
but
very
irritable
and
full
of
fancies
and
in
one
of
these
he
begged
denys
to
get
him
a
lemon
to
suck
denys
who
from
a
rough
soldier
had
been
turned
by
tender
friendship
into
a
kind
of
grandfather
got
up
hastily
and
bidding
him
set
his
mind
at
ease
lemons
he
should
have
in
the
twinkling
of
a
quart
pot
went
and
ransacked
the
shops
for
them
they
were
not
so
common
in
the
north
as
they
are
now
and
he
was
absent
a
long
while
and
gerard
getting
very
impatient
when
at
last
the
door
opened
but
it
was
not
denys
entered
softly
an
imposing
figure
an
old
gentleman
in
a
long
sober
gown
trimmed
with
rich
fur
hose
and
pointed
shoes
with
a
sword
by
his
side
in
a
morocco
scabbard
a
ruff
round
his
neck
not
only
starched
severely
but
treacherously
stiffened
in
furrows
by
rebatoes
or
a
little
hidden
framework
of
wood
and
on
his
head
a
cap
with
a
fur
border
on
his
chin
and
bosom
a
majestic
white
beard
gerard
was
in
no
doubt
as
to
the
vocation
of
his
visitor
for
the
sword
excepted
this
was
familiar
to
him
as
the
full
dress
of
a
physician
moreover
a
boy
followed
at
his
heels
with
a
basket
where
phials
lint
and
surgical
tools
rather
courted
than
shunned
observation
the
old
gentleman
came
softly
to
the
bedside
and
said
mildly
and
sotto
voce
how
with
thee
my
son
gerard
answered
gratefully
that
his
wound
gave
him
little
pain
now
but
his
throat
was
parched
and
his
head
heavy
a
wound
they
told
me
not
of
that
let
me
see
it
ay
ay
a
good
clean
bite
the
mastiff
had
sound
teeth
that
took
this
out
i
warrant
me
and
the
good
doctor
sympathy
seemed
to
run
off
to
the
quadruped
he
had
conjured
his
jackal
this
must
be
cauterized
forthwith
or
we
shall
have
you
starting
back
from
water
and
turning
somersaults
in
bed
under
our
hands
is
the
year
for
raving
curs
and
one
hath
done
your
business
but
we
will
baffle
him
yet
urchin
go
heat
thine
but
sir
edged
in
gerard
was
no
dog
but
a
a
bear
young
man
remonstrated
the
senior
severely
think
what
you
say
is
ill
jesting
with
the
man
of
art
who
brings
his
grey
hairs
and
long
study
to
heal
you
a
bear
quotha
had
you
dissected
as
many
bears
as
i
or
the
tithe
and
drawn
their
teeth
to
keep
your
hand
in
you
would
know
that
no
bear
jaw
ever
made
this
foolish
trifling
wound
i
tell
you
was
a
dog
and
since
you
put
me
to
it
i
even
deny
that
it
was
a
dog
of
magnitude
but
neither
more
nor
less
than
one
of
these
little
furious
curs
that
are
so
rife
and
run
devious
biting
each
manly
leg
and
laying
its
wearer
low
but
for
me
and
my
learned
brethren
who
still
stay
the
mischief
with
knife
and
alas
sir
when
said
i
was
a
bear
jaw
i
said
bear
it
was
his
paw
and
why
didst
not
tell
me
that
at
once
because
you
kept
telling
me
never
conceal
aught
from
your
leech
young
man
continued
the
senior
who
was
a
good
talker
but
one
of
the
worst
listeners
in
europe
well
it
is
an
ill
business
all
the
horny
excrescences
of
animals
to
wit
claws
of
tigers
panthers
badgers
cats
bears
and
the
like
and
horn
of
deer
and
nails
of
humans
especially
children
are
imbued
with
direst
poison
better
have
been
bitten
by
a
cur
whatever
you
may
say
than
gored
by
bull
or
stag
or
scratched
by
bear
however
shalt
have
a
good
biting
cataplasm
for
thy
leg
meantime
keep
we
the
body
cool
put
out
thy
tongue
let
me
feel
thy
pulse
good
fever
i
ordain
flebotomy
and
on
the
flebotomy
that
is
bloodletting
humph
well
no
matter
if
is
sure
to
cure
me
for
i
will
not
lie
idle
the
doctor
let
him
know
that
flebotomy
was
infallible
especially
in
this
case
hans
go
fetch
the
things
needful
and
i
will
entertain
the
patient
meantime
with
the
man
of
art
then
explained
to
gerard
that
in
disease
the
blood
becomes
hot
and
distempered
and
more
or
less
poisonous
but
a
portion
of
this
unhealthy
liquid
removed
nature
is
fain
to
create
a
purer
fluid
to
fill
its
place
bleeding
therefore
being
both
a
cooler
and
a
purifier
was
a
specific
in
all
diseases
for
all
diseases
were
febrile
whatever
empirics
might
say
but
think
not
said
he
warmly
that
it
suffices
to
bleed
any
paltry
barber
can
open
a
vein
though
not
all
can
close
it
again
the
art
is
to
know
what
vein
to
empty
for
what
disease
day
they
brought
me
one
tormented
with
earache
i
let
him
blood
in
the
right
thigh
and
away
flew
his
earache
he
has
died
since
then
another
came
with
the
toothache
i
bled
him
behind
the
ear
and
relieved
him
in
a
jiffy
he
is
also
since
dead
as
it
happens
i
bled
our
bailiff
between
the
thumb
and
forefinger
for
rheumatism
presently
he
comes
to
me
with
a
headache
and
drumming
in
the
ears
and
holds
out
his
hand
over
the
basin
but
i
smiled
at
his
folly
and
bled
him
in
the
left
ankle
sore
against
his
will
and
made
his
head
as
light
as
a
diverging
then
from
the
immediate
theme
after
the
manner
of
enthusiasts
the
reverend
teacher
proceeded
thus
know
young
man
that
two
schools
of
art
contend
at
this
moment
throughout
europe
the
arabian
whose
ancient
oracles
are
avicenna
rhazes
albucazis
and
its
revivers
are
chauliac
and
lanfranc
and
the
greek
school
whose
modern
champions
are
bessarion
platinus
and
marsilius
ficinus
but
whose
pristine
doctors
were
medicine
very
oracles
phoebus
chiron
aesculapius
and
his
sons
podalinus
and
machaon
pythagoras
democritus
praxagoras
who
invented
the
arteries
and
dioctes
primus
urinae
animum
dedit
all
these
taught
orally
then
came
hippocrates
the
eighteenth
from
aesculapius
and
of
him
we
have
manuscripts
to
him
we
owe
vital
principle
he
also
invented
the
bandage
and
tapped
for
water
on
the
chest
and
above
all
he
dissected
yet
only
quadrupeds
for
the
brutal
prejudices
of
the
pagan
vulgar
withheld
the
human
body
from
the
knife
of
science
him
followed
aristotle
who
gave
us
the
aorta
the
largest
in
the
human
surely
sir
the
almighty
gave
us
all
that
is
in
our
bodies
and
not
aristotle
nor
any
grecian
man
objected
gerard
humbly
child
of
course
he
gave
us
the
thing
but
aristotle
did
more
he
gave
us
the
name
of
the
thing
but
young
men
will
still
be
talking
the
next
great
light
was
galen
he
studied
at
alexandria
then
the
home
of
science
he
justly
malcontent
with
quadrupeds
dissected
apes
as
coming
nearer
to
man
and
bled
like
a
trojan
then
came
theophilus
who
gave
us
the
nerves
the
lacteal
vessels
and
the
pia
this
worried
gerard
i
can
not
lie
still
and
hear
it
said
that
mortal
man
bestowed
the
parts
which
adam
our
father
took
from
him
who
made
him
of
the
clay
and
us
his
was
ever
such
perversity
said
the
doctor
his
colour
rising
who
is
the
real
donor
of
a
thing
to
man
he
who
plants
it
secretly
in
the
dark
recesses
of
man
body
or
the
learned
wight
who
reveals
it
to
his
intelligence
and
so
enriches
his
mind
with
the
knowledge
of
it
comprehension
is
your
only
true
possession
are
you
answered
i
am
put
to
silence
and
that
is
better
still
for
garrulous
patients
are
ill
to
cure
especially
in
fever
i
say
then
that
eristratus
gave
us
the
cerebral
nerves
and
the
milk
vessels
nay
more
he
was
the
inventor
of
lithotomy
whatever
you
may
say
then
came
another
whom
i
forget
you
do
somewhat
perturb
me
with
your
petty
exceptions
then
came
ammonius
the
author
of
lithotrity
and
here
comes
hans
with
the
stay
your
volubility
blow
thy
chafer
boy
and
hand
me
the

is
well
arabians
quotha
what
are
they
but
a
sect
of
yesterday
who
about
the
year
did
fall
in
with
the
writings
of
those
very
greeks
and
read
them
awry
having
no
concurrent
light
of
their
own
for
their
demigod
and
mahound
impostor
in
science
as
in
religion
had
strictly
forbidden
them
anatomy
even
of
the
lower
animals
the
which

who

not
at
my
fervour
good
youth
where
the
general
weal
stands
in
jeopardy
a
little
warmth
is
civic
humane
and
honourable
now
there
is
settled
of
late
in
this
town
a
pestilent
arabist
a
mere
empiric
who
despising
anatomy
and
scarce
knowing
greek
from
hebrew
hath
yet
spirited
away
half
my
patients
and
i
tremble
for
the

whilst
matters
were
in
this
posture
in
came
denys
with
the
lemons
and
stood
surprised
what
sport
is
toward
said
he
raising
his
brows
gerard
coloured
a
little
and
told
him
the
learned
doctor
was
going
to
flebotomize
him
and
cauterize
him
that
was
all
ay
indeed
and
yon
imp
what
bloweth
he
hot
coals
for
what
should
it
be
for
said
the
doctor
to
gerard
but
to
cauterize
the
vein
when
opened
and
the
poisonous
blood
let
free
is
the
only
safe
way
avicenna
indeed
recommends
a
ligature
of
the
vein
but
how
to
be
done
he
saith
not
nor
knew
he
himself
i
wot
nor
any
of
the
spawn
of
ishmael
for
me
i
have
no
faith
in
such
tricksy
expedients
and
take
this
with
you
for
a
safe
principle
an
arab
or
arabist
says
is
right
must
be
wrong
oh
i
see
now
what
is
for
said
denys
and
art
thou
so
simple
as
to
let
him
put
hot
iron
to
thy
living
flesh
didst
ever
keep
thy
little
finger
but
ten
moments
in
a
candle
and
this
will
be
as
many
minutes
art
not
content
to
burn
in
purgatory
after
thy
death
must
thou
needs
buy
a
foretaste
o
here
i
never
thought
of
that
said
gerard
gravely
the
good
doctor
spake
not
of
burning
but
of
cautery
to
be
sure
is
all
one
but
cautery
sounds
not
so
fearful
as
imbecile
that
is
their
art
to
confound
a
plain
man
with
dark
words
till
his
hissing
flesh
lets
him
know
their
meaning
now
listen
to
what
i
have
seen
when
a
soldier
bleeds
from
a
wound
in
battle
these
leeches
say
blood
him
and
so
they
burn
the
wick
at
end
too
they
bleed
the
bled
now
at
fever
heels
comes
desperate
weakness
then
the
man
needs
all
his
blood
to
live
but
these
prickers
and
burners
having
no
forethought
recking
nought
of
what
is
sure
to
come
in
a
few
hours
and
seeing
like
brute
beasts
only
what
is
under
their
noses
having
meantime
robbed
him
of
the
very
blood
his
hurt
had
spared
him
to
battle
that
weakness
withal
and
so
he
dies
exhausted
hundreds
have
i
seen
so
scratched
and
pricked
out
of
the
world
gerard
and
tall
fellows
too
but
lo
if
they
have
the
luck
to
be
wounded
where
no
doctor
can
be
had
then
they
live
this
too
have
i
seen
had
i
ever
outlived
that
field
in
brabant
but
for
my
most
lucky
mischance
lack
of
chirurgery
the
frost
chocked
all
my
bleeding
wounds
and
so
i
lived
a
chirurgeon
had
pricked
yet
one
more
hole
in
this
my
body
with
his
lance
and
drained
my
last
drop
out
and
my
spirit
with
it
seeing
them
thus
distraught
in
bleeding
of
the
bleeding
soldier
i
place
no
trust
in
them
for
what
slays
a
veteran
may
well
lay
a
bourgeois
this
sounds
like
common
sense
sighed
gerard
languidly
but
no
need
to
raise
your
voice
so
i
was
not
born
deaf
and
just
now
i
hear
common
sense
very
common
sense
indeed
shouted
the
bad
listener
why
this
is
a
soldier
a
brute
whose
business
is
to
kill
men
not
cure
he
added
in
very
tolerable
french
woe
be
to
you
unlearned
man
if
you
come
between
a
physician
and
his
patient
and
woe
be
to
you
misguided
youth
if
you
listen
to
that
man
of
much
obliged
said
denys
with
mock
politeness
but
i
am
a
true
man
and
would
rob
no
man
of
his
name
i
do
somewhat
in
the
way
of
blood
but
not
worth
mention
in
this
presence
for
one
i
slay
you
slay
a
score
and
for
one
spoonful
of
blood
i
draw
you
spill
a
tubful
the
world
is
still
gulled
by
shows
we
soldiers
vapour
with
long
swords
and
even
in
war
two
foes
for
every
one
we
kill
but
you
smooth
gownsmen
with
soft
phrases
and
bare
bodkins
is
you
that
thin
a
sick
chamber
is
no
place
for
jesting
cried
the
physician
no
doctor
nor
for
bawling
said
the
patient
peevishly
come
young
man
said
the
senior
kindly
be
reasonable

my
whole
life
has
been
given
to
this
art
i
studied
at
montpelier
the
first
school
in
france
and
by
consequence
in
europe
there
learned
i
dririmancy
scatomancy
pathology
therapeusis
and
greater
than

all
anatomy
for
there
we

never
knew
goodbye
quadrupeds

we
bought

shook

we
undid
the
sexton
work
of
dark
nights
penetrated
with
love
of

our

he
sent
us
twice
a

a

criminal
condemned
to

him

shouted
denys
at
the
top
of
his
voice
gerard
gave
a
little
squawk
and
put
his
fingers
in
his
ears
but
speedily
drew
them
out
and
shouted
angrily
and
as
loudly
you
great
roaring
blaspheming
bull
of
basan

your
noisy
tongue
denys
summoned
a
contrite
look

slight

said
the
doctor
with
calm
contempt
and
vibrated
a
hand
over
him
as
in
this
age
men
make
a
pointer
dog
down
charge
then
flowed
majestic
on
we
seldom
or
never
dissected
the
living
criminal
except
in

we
mostly
inoculated
them
with
such
diseases
as
the

we
watched
through

to

the
death
of
the
poor
rogue
whispered
denys
meekly
and
now
my
poor
sufferer
who
best
merits
your
confidence
this
honest
soldier
with
his
youth
his
ignorance
and
his
prejudices
or
a
greybeard
laden
with
the
gathered
wisdom
of
ages
that
is
cried
denys
impatiently
will
you
believe
what
a
jackdaw
in
a
long
gown
has
heard
from
a
starling
in
a
long
gown
who
heard
it
from
a
who
heard
it
from
a
magpie
who
heard
it
from

or
will
you
believe
what
i
a

with
nought
to
gain
by
looking
awry
nor
speaking
false
have
seen
nor
heard
with
the

stay
who
sent
for
this
did
you
not
i
thought
you
nay
explained
the
doctor
the
good
landlord
told
me
one
was
in
his
house
so
i
said
to
myself
stranger
and
in
need
of
my
art
and
came
it
was
the
act
of
a
good
christian
of
a
good
bloodhound
cried
denys
contemptuously
what
art
thou
so
green
as
not
to
know
that
all
these
landlords
are
in
league
with
certain
of
their
who
pay
them
toll
on
each
booty
whatever
you
pay
this
ancient
for
stealing
your
life
blood
of
that
the
landlord
takes
his
third
for
betraying
you
to
him
nay
more
as
soon
as
ever
your
blood
goes
down
the
stair
in
that
basin
there
the
landlord
will
see
it
or
smell
it
and
send
swiftly
to
his
undertaker
and
get
his
third
out
of
that
job
for
if
he
waited
till
the
doctor
got
downstairs
the
doctor
would
be
beforehand
and
bespeak
his
undertaker
and
then
he
would
get
the
black
thirds
say
i
sooth
old
rouge
et
noir
dites
denys
denys
who
taught
you
to
think
so
ill
of
man
mine
eyes
that
are
not
to
be
gulled
by
what
men
say
seeing
this
many
a
year
what
they
do
in
all
the
lands
i
the
doctor
with
some
address
made
use
of
these
last
words
to
escape
the
personal
question
i
too
have
eyes
as
well
as
thou
and
go
not
by
tradition
only
but
by
what
i
have
seen
and
not
only
seen
but
done
i
have
healed
as
many
men
by
bleeding
as
that
interloping
arabist
has
killed
for
want
of
it
was
but
day
i
healed
one
threatened
with
leprosy
i
but
bled
him
at
the
tip
of
the
nose
i
cured
last
year
a
quartan
ague
how
bled
its
forefinger
our
cure
lost
his
memory
i
brought
it
him
back
on
the
point
of
my
lance
i
bled
him
behind
the
ear
i
bled
a
dolt
of
a
boy
and
now
he
is
the
only
one
who
can
tell
his
right
hand
from
his
left
in
a
whole
family
of
idiots
when
the
plague
was
here
years
ago
no
sham
plague
such
as
empyrics
proclaim
every
six
years
or
so
but
the
good
honest
byzantine
pest
i
blooded
an
alderman
freely
and
cauterized
the
symptomatic
buboes
and
so
pulled
him
out
of
the
grave
whereas
our
then
chirurgeon
a
most
pernicious
arabist
caught
it
himself
and
died
of
it
aha
calling
on
rhazes
avicenna
and
mahound
who
could
they
have
come
had
all
perished
as
miserably
as
oh
my
poor
ears
sighed
gerard
and
am
i
fallen
so
low
that
one
of
your
presence
and
speech
rejects
my
art
and
listens
to
a
rude
soldier
so
far
behind
even
his
own
miserable
trade
as
to
bear
an
arbalest
a
invention
that
german
children
shoot
at
pigeons
with
but
german
soldiers
mock
at
since
ever
arquebusses
came
and
put
them
down
you
old
charlatan
cried
denys
the
arbalest
is
shouldered
by
taller
men
than
ever
stood
in
rhenish
hose
and
even
now
it
kills
as
many
more
than
your
noisy
stinking
arquebus
as
the
lancet
does
than
all
our
toys
together
go
to
he
was
no
fool
who
first
called
you
va
gerard
groaned
by
the
holy
virgin
i
wish
you
were
both
at
jericho
bellowing
thank
you
comrade
then
i
bark
no
more
but
at
need
i
bite
if
he
has
a
lance
i
have
a
sword
if
he
bleeds
you
i
bleed
him
the
moment
his
lance
pricks
your
skin
little
one
my
knocks
against
his
ribs
i
have
said
and
denys
turned
pale
folded
his
arms
and
looked
gloomy
and
dangerous
gerard
sighed
wearily
now
as
all
this
is
about
me
give
me
leave
to
say
a
ay
let
the
young
man
choose
life
or
death
for
gerard
then
indirectly
rebuked
his
noisy
counsellors
by
contrast
and
example
he
spoke
with
unparalleled
calmness
sweetness
and
gentleness
and
these
were
the
words
of
gerard
the
son
of
eli
i
doubt
not
you
both
mean
me
well
but
you
assassinate
me
between
you
calmness
and
quiet
are
everything
to
me
but
you
are
like
two
dogs
growling
over
a
bone
and
in
sooth
bone
i
should
be
did
this
uproar
last
there
was
a
dead
silence
broken
only
by
the
silvery
voice
of
gerard
as
he
lay
tranquil
and
gazed
calmly
at
the
ceiling
and
trickled
into
words
first
venerable
sir
i
thank
you
for
coming
to
see
me
whether
from
humanity
or
in
the
way
of
honest
gain
all
trades
must
live
your
learning
reverend
sir
seems
great
to
me
at
least
and
for
your
experience
your
age
voucheth
it
you
say
you
have
bled
many
and
of
these
many
many
have
not
died
thereafter
but
lived
and
done
well
i
must
needs
believe
the
physician
bowed
denys
grunted
others
you
say
you
have
bled
are
dead
i
must
needs
believe
you
denys
knows
few
things
compared
with
you
but
he
knows
them
well
he
is
a
man
not
given
to
conjecture
this
i
myself
have
noted
he
says
he
has
seen
the
fevered
and
blooded
for
the
most
part
die
the
fevered
and
not
blooded
live
i
must
needs
believe
him
here
then
all
is
doubt
but
thus
much
is
certain
if
i
be
bled
i
must
pay
you
a
fee
and
be
burnt
and
excruciated
with
a
hot
iron
who
am
no
felon
pay
a
certain
price
in
money
and
anguish
for
a
doubtful
remedy
that
will
i
never
next
to
money
and
ease
peace
and
quiet
are
certain
goods
above
all
in
a
but
seem
men
can
not
argue
medicine
without
heat
and
raised
voices
therefore
sir
i
will
essay
a
little
sleep
and
denys
will
go
forth
and
gaze
on
the
females
of
the
place
and
i
will
keep
you
no
longer
from
those
who
can
afford
to
lay
out
blood
and
money
in
flebotomy
and
the
old
physician
had
naturally
a
hot
temper
he
had
often
during
this
battle
of
words
mastered
it
with
difficulty
and
now
it
mastered
him
the
most
dignified
course
was
silence
he
saw
this
and
drew
himself
up
and
made
loftily
for
the
door
followed
close
by
his
little
boy
and
big
basket
but
at
the
door
he
choked
he
swelled
he
burst
he
whirled
and
came
back
and
the
little
boy
and
big
basket
had
to
whisk
semicircularly
not
to
be
run
down
for
de
minimis
non
curat
when
not
in
a
rage
ah
you
reject
my
skill
you
scorn
my
art
my
revenge
shall
be
to
leave
you
to
yourself
lost
idiot
take
your
last
look
at
me
and
at
the
sun
your
blood
be
on
your
head
and
away
he
stamped
but
on
reaching
the
door
he
whirled
and
came
back
his
wicker
tail
twirling
round
after
him
like
a
cat
in
twelve
hours
at
furthest
you
will
be
in
the
secondary
stage
of
fever
your
head
will
split
your
carotids
will
thump
aha
and
let
but
a
pin
fall
you
will
jump
to
the
ceiling
then
send
for
me
and
i
not
he
departed
but
at
the
gathered
fury
wheeled
and
came
flying
with
pale
boy
and
wicker
tail
whisking
after
him
next
will
come
cramps
of
the
stomach
aha
then
bilious
vomit
aha
then
cold
sweat
and
deadly
stupor
then
confusion
of
all
the
senses
then
bloody
vomit
and
after
that
nothing
can
save
you
not
even
i
and
if
i
could
i
would
not
and
so
farewell
even
denys
changed
colour
at
threats
so
fervent
and
precise
but
gerard
only
gnashed
his
teeth
with
rage
at
the
noise
and
seized
his
hard
bolster
with
kindling
eye
this
added
fuel
to
the
fire
and
brought
the
insulted
ancient
back
from
the
impassable
door
with
his
whisking
train
and
after
that
madness
and
after
that
black
vomit
and
then
convulsions
and
then
that
cessation
of
all
vital
functions
the
vulgar
call
for
which
thank
your
own
satanic
folly
and
insolence
he
went
he
came
he
roared
and
think
not
to
be
buried
in
any
christian
for
the
bailiff
is
my
good
friend
and
i
shall
tell
him
how
and
why
you
died
felo
de
se
felo
de

gerard
sprang
to
his
feet
on
the
bed
by
some
supernatural
gymnastic
power
excitement
lent
him
and
seeing
him
so
moved
the
vindictive
orator
came
back
at
him
fiercer
than
ever
to
launch
some
the
world
has
unhappily
lost
for
as
he
came
with
his
whisking
train
and
shaking
his
fist
gerard
hurled
the
bolster
furiously
in
his
face
and
knocked
him
down
like
a
shot
the
boy
head
cracked
under
his
falling
master
and
crash
went
the
orator
into
the
basket
and
there
sat
wedged
in
an
inverted
angle
crushing
phial
after
phial
the
boy
being
light
was
strewed
afar
but
in
a
squatting
posture
so
that
they
sat
in
a
sequence
like
graduated
specimens
the
smaller
howling
but
soon
the
doctor
face
filled
with
horror
and
he
uttered
a
far
louder
and
unearthly
screech
and
kicked
and
struggled
with
wonderful
agility
for
one
of
his
age
he
was
sitting
on
the
hot
coals
they
had
singed
the
cloth
and
were
now
biting
the
man
struggling
wildly
but
vainly
to
get
out
of
the
basket
he
rolled
yelling
over
with
it
sideways
and
lo
a
great
hissing
then
the
humane
gerard
ran
and
wrenched
off
the
tight
basket
not
without
a
struggle
the
doctor
lay
on
his
face
groaning
handsomely
singed
with
his
own
chafer
and
slaked
a
moment
too
late
by
his
own
villainous
compounds
which
however
being
as
various
and
even
beautiful
in
colour
as
they
were
odious
in
taste
had
strangely
diversified
his
grey
robe
and
painted
it
more
gaudy
than
neat
gerard
and
denys
raised
him
up
and
consoled
him
courage
man
is
but
cautery
balm
of
gilead
why
you
recommend
it
but
now
to
my
comrade
the
physician
replied
only
by
a
look
of
concentrated
spite
and
went
out
in
dead
silence
thrusting
his
stomach
forth
before
him
in
the
drollest
way
the
boy
followed
him
next
moment
but
in
that
slight
interval
he
left
off
whining
burst
into
a
grin
and
conveyed
to
the
culprits
by
an
unrefined
gesture
his
accurate
comprehension
of
and
rapturous
though
compressed
joy
at
his
master
disaster
chapter
xxvii
the
worthy
physician
went
home
and
told
his
housekeeper
he
was
in
agony
from
a
bad
those
were
the
words
for
in
phlogistic
as
in
other
things
we
cauterize
our
neighbour
digits
but
burn
our
own
fingers
his
housekeeper
applied
some
old
women
remedy
mild
as
milk
he
submitted
like
a
lamb
to
her
experience
his
sole
object
in
the
case
of
this
patient
being
cure
meantime
he
made
out
his
bill
for
broken
phials
and
took
measures
to
have
the
travellers
imprisoned
at
once
he
made
oath
before
a
magistrate
that
they
being
strangers
and
indebted
to
him
meditated
instant
flight
from
the
township
alas
it
was
his
unlucky
day
his
sincere
desire
and
honest
endeavour
to
perjure
himself
were
baffled
by
a
circumstance
he
had
never
foreseen
nor
indeed
thought
possible
he
had
spoken
the
truth
and
in
an
affidavit
the
officers
on
reaching
the
silver
lion
found
the
birds
were
flown
they
went
down
to
the
river
and
from
intelligence
they
received
there
started
up
the
bank
in
hot
pursuit
this
temporary
escape
the
friends
owed
to
denys
good
sense
and
observation
after
a
peal
of
laughter
that
it
was
a
cordial
to
hear
and
after
venting
his
watchword
three
times
he
turned
short
grave
and
told
gerard
dusseldorf
was
no
place
for
them
that
old
fellow
said
he
went
off
unnaturally
silent
for
such
a
babbler
we
are
strangers
here
the
bailiff
is
his
friend
in
five
minutes
we
shall
lie
in
a
dungeon
for
assaulting
a
dusseldorf
dignity
are
you
strong
enough
to
hobble
to
the
water
edge
it
is
hard
by
once
there
you
have
but
to
lie
down
in
a
boat
instead
of
a
bed
and
what
is
the
odds
the
odds
denys
untold
and
all
in
favour
of
the
boat
i
pine
for
rome
for
rome
is
my
road
to
sevenbergen
and
then
we
shall
lie
in
the
boat
but
on
the
rhine
the
famous
rhine
the
cool
refreshing
rhine
i
feel
its
breezes
coming
the
very
sight
will
cure
a
little
fever
like
mine
away
away
finding
his
excitable
friend
in
this
mood
denys
settled
hastily
with
the
landlord
and
they
hurried
to
the
river
on
inquiry
they
found
to
their
dismay
that
the
public
boat
was
gone
this
half
hour
and
no
other
would
start
that
day
being
afternoon
by
dint
however
of
asking
a
great
many
questions
and
collecting
a
crowd
they
obtained
an
offer
of
a
private
boat
from
an
old
man
and
his
two
sons
this
was
duly
ridiculed
by
a
bystander
the
current
is
too
strong
for
three
then
my
comrade
and
i
will
help
row
said
the
invalid
no
need
said
the
old
man
bless
your
silly
heart
he
owns
there
was
a
powerful
breeze
right
astern
the
boatmen
set
a
broad
sail
and
rowing
also
went
off
at
a
spanking
rate
are
ye
better
lad
for
the
river
breeze
much
better
but
indeed
the
doctor
did
me
the
doctor
why
you
would
none
of
his
no
but
i
mean
you
will
say
i
am
nought
but
knocking
the
old
fool
down
somehow
it
soothed
amiable
dove
how
thy
little
character
opens
more
and
more
every
day
like
a
rosebud
i
read
thee
all
wrong
at
nay
denys
mistake
me
not
neither
i
trust
i
had
borne
with
his
idle
threats
though
in
sooth
his
voice
went
through
my
poor
ears
but
he
was
an
infidel
or
next
door
to
one
and
such
i
have
been
taught
to
abhor
did
he
not
as
good
as
say
we
owed
our
inward
parts
to
men
with
long
greek
names
and
not
to
him
whose
name
is
but
a
syllable
but
whose
hand
is
over
all
the
earth
pagan
so
you
knocked
him
down
forthwith
like
a
good
now
denys
you
will
still
be
jesting
take
not
an
ill
man
part
had
it
been
a
thunderbolt
from
heaven
he
had
met
but
his
due
yet
he
took
but
a
sorry
bolster
from
this
weak
what
weak
arm
inquired
denys
with
twinkling
eyes
i
have
lived
among
arms
and
by
samson
hairy
pow
never
saw
i
one
more
like
a
catapult
the
bolster
wrapped
round
his
nose
and
the
two
ends
kissed
behind
his
head
and
his
forehead
resounded
and
had
he
been
goliath
or
julius
caesar
instead
of
an
old
quacksalver
down
he
had
gone
denys
guard
me
from
such
feeble
opposites
as
thou
and
above
all
from
their
weak
arms
thou
diabolical
young
the
river
took
many
turns
and
this
sometimes
brought
the
wind
on
their
side
instead
of
right
astern
then
they
all
moved
to
the
weather
side
to
prevent
the
boat
heeling
over
too
much
all
but
a
child
of
about
five
years
old
the
grandson
of
the
boatman
and
his
darling
this
urchin
had
slipped
on
board
at
the
moment
of
starting
and
being
too
light
to
affect
the
boat
trim
was
above
or
rather
below
the
laws
of
navigation
they
sailed
merrily
on
little
conscious
that
they
were
pursued
by
a
whole
posse
of
constables
armed
with
the
bailiff
writ
and
that
their
pursuers
were
coming
up
with
them
for
if
the
wind
was
strong
so
was
the
current
and
now
gerard
suddenly
remembered
that
this
was
a
very
good
way
to
rome
but
not
to
burgundy
oh
denys
said
he
with
an
almost
alarmed
look
this
is
not
your
i
know
it
said
denys
quietly
but
what
can
i
do
i
can
not
leave
thee
till
the
fever
leaves
thee
and
it
is
on
thee
still
for
thou
art
both
red
and
white
by
turns
i
have
watched
thee
i
must
go
on
to
cologne
i
doubt
and
then
strike
thank
heaven
said
gerard
joyfully
he
added
eagerly
with
a
little
touch
of
a
sin
to
be
so
near
cologne
and
not
see
it
oh
man
it
is
a
vast
and
ancient
city
such
as
i
have
often
dreamed
of
but
had
the
good
luck
to
see
me
miserable
by
what
hard
fortune
do
i
come
to
it
now
well
then
denys
continued
the
young
man
less
warmly
it
is
old
enough
to
have
been
founded
by
a
roman
lady
in
the
first
century
of
grace
and
sacked
by
attila
the
barbarous
and
afterwards
sore
defaced
by
the
norman
lothaire
and
it
has
a
church
for
every
week
in
the
year
forbye
chapels
and
churches
innumerable
of
convents
and
nunneries
and
above
all
the
stupendous
minster
yet
unfinished
and
therein
but
in
their
own
chapel
lie
the
three
kings
that
brought
gifts
to
our
lord
melchior
gold
and
gaspar
frankincense
and
balthazar
the

brought
myrrh

over
their
bones

two

run
to

fro
of
jewels
so

but
some
of

are
wearied
of

by
this
tush
denys
said
gerard
why
wilt
thou
being
good
still
make
thyself
seem
evil
if

that

there

in
which
they

draws
denys
of

to

gerard
hung
his
head
at
this
juncture
one
of
the
younger
boatmen
suddenly
inquired
what
was
amiss
with
little
his
young
nephew
thus
described
had
just
come
aft
grave
as
a
judge
and
burst
out
crying
in
the
midst
without
more
ado
on
this
phenomenon
so
sharply
defined
he
was
subjected
to
many
interrogatories
some
coaxingly
uttered
some
not
had
he
hurt
himself
had
he
himself
was
he
frightened
was
he
cold
was
he
sick
was
he
an
idiot
to
all
and
each
he
uttered
the
same
reply
which
english
writers
render
thus
oh
oh
oh
and
french
writers
thus
hi
hi
hi
so
fixed
are
fiction
phonetics
who
can
tell
what
ails
the
peevish
brat
snarled
the
young
boatman
impatiently
rather
look
this
way
and
tell
me
whom
be
these
after
the
old
man
and
his
other
son
looked
and
saw
four
men
walking
along
the
east
bank
of
the
river
at
the
sight
they
left
rowing
awhile
and
gathered
mysteriously
in
the
stern
whispering
and
casting
glances
alternately
at
their
passengers
and
the
pedestrians
the
sequel
may
show
they
would
have
employed
speculation
better
in
trying
to
fathom
the
mystery
i
beg
pardon
of
my
age
i
mean
the
deep
mind
of
dauntless
infancy
if
is
as
i
doubt
whispered
one
of
the
young
men
why
not
give
them
a
squeak
for
their
lives
let
us
make
for
the
west
the
old
man
objected
stoutly
what
said
he
run
our
heads
into
trouble
for
strangers
are
ye
mad
nay
let
us
rather
cross
to
the
east
side
still
side
with
the
strong
arm
that
is
my
rede
what
say
you
werter
i
say
please
what
age
and
youth
could
not
decide
upon
a
puff
of
wind
settled
most
impartially
came
a
squall
and
the
little
vessel
heeled
over
the
men
jumped
to
windward
to
trim
her
but
to
their
horror
they
saw
in
the
very
boat
from
stem
to
stern
a
ditch
of
water
rushing
to
leeward
and
the
next
moment
they
saw
nothing
but
felt
the
rhine
the
cold
and
rushing
rhine
had
drawn
the
plug
the
officers
unwound
the
cords
from
their
waists
gerard
could
swim
like
a
duck
but
the
best
swimmer
canted
out
of
a
boat
capsized
must
sink
ere
he
can
swim
the
dark
water
bubbled
loudly
over
his
head
and
then
he
came
up
almost
blind
and
deaf
for
a
moment
the
next
he
saw
the
black
boat
bottom
uppermost
and
figures
clinging
to
it
he
shook
his
head
like
a
and
made
for
it
by
a
sort
of
unthinking
imitation
but
ere
he
reached
it
he
heard
a
voice
behind
him
cry
not
loud
but
with
deep
manly
distress
adieu
comrade
adieu
he
looked
and
there
was
poor
denys
sinking
sinking
weighed
down
by
his
wretched
arbalest
his
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
staring
wide
and
turned
despairingly
on
his
dear
friend
gerard
uttered
a
wild
cry
of
love
and
terror
and
made
for
him
cleaving
the
water
madly
but
the
next
moment
denys
was
under
water
the
next
gerard
was
after
him
the
officers
knotted
a
rope
and
threw
the
end
in
chapter
xxviii
things
good
and
evil
balance
themselves
in
a
remarkable
manner
and
almost
universally
the
steel
bow
attached
to
the
arbalestrier
back
and
carried
above
his
head
had
sunk
him
that
very
steel
bow
owing
to
that
very
position
could
not
escape
gerard
hands
one
of
which
grasped
it
and
the
other
went
between
the
bow
and
the
cord
which
was
as
good
the
next
moment
denys
by
means
of
his
crossbow
was
hoisted
with
so
eager
a
jerk
that
half
his
body
bobbed
up
out
of
water
now
grip
me
not
grip
me
not
cried
gerard
in
mortal
terror
of
that
fatal
mistake
pas

gurgled
denys
seeing
the
sort
of
stuff
he
had
to
deal
with
gerard
was
hopeful
and
calm
directly
on
thy
back
said
he
sharply
and
seizing
the
arbalest
and
taking
a
stroke
forward
he
aided
the
desired
movement

on
my
shoulder

the
water
with
the
other
hand

with
a
downward
motion

gerard
had
got
hold
of
denys
long
hair
and
twisting
it
hard
caught
the
end
between
his
side
teeth
and
with
the
strong
muscles
of
his
youthful
neck
easily
kept
up
the
soldier
head
and
struck
out
lustily
across
the
current
a
moment
he
had
hesitated
which
side
to
make
for
little
knowing
the
awful
importance
of
that
simple
decision
then
seeing
the
west
bank
a
trifle
nearest
he
made
towards
it
instead
of
swimming
to
jail
like
a
good
boy
and
so
furnishing
one
a
novel
incident
owing
to
the
force
of
the
current
they
slanted
considerably
and
when
they
had
covered
near
a
hundred
yards
denys
murmured
uneasily
how
much
more
of
it
courage
mumbled
gerard
whatever
a
duck
knows
a
dutchman
knows
art
safe
as
in
the
next
moment
to
their
surprise
they
found
themselves
in
shallow
water
and
so
waded
ashore
once
on
terra
firma
they
looked
at
one
another
from
head
to
foot
as
if
eyes
could
devour
then
by
one
impulse
flung
each
an
arm
round
the
other
neck
and
panted
there
with
hearts
too
full
to
speak
and
at
this
sacred
moment
life
was
sweet
as
heaven
to
both
sweetest
perhaps
to
the
poor
exiled
lover
who
had
just
saved
his
friend
oh
joy
to
whose
height
what
poet
has
yet
soared
or
ever
tried
to
soar
to
save
a
human
life
and
that
life
a
loved
one
such
moments
are
worth
living
for
ay
three
score
years
and
ten
and
then
calmer
they
took
hands
and
so
walked
along
the
bank
hand
in
hand
like
a
pair
of
sweethearts
scarce
knowing
or
caring
whither
they
went
the
boat
people
were
all
safe
on
the
late
concave
now
convex
craft
herr
the
inverter
of
things
being
in
the
middle
all
this
fracas
seemed
not
to
have
essentially
deranged
his
habits
at
least
he
was
greeting
when
he
shot
our
friends
into
the
rhine
and
greeting
when
they
got
out
again
shall
we
wait
till
they
right
the
boat
no
denys
our
fare
is
paid
we
owe
them
nought
let
us
on
and
denys
assented
observing
that
they
could
walk
all
the
way
to
cologne
on
this
bank
i
fare
not
to
cologne
was
the
calm
reply
why
whither
then
to
to
burgundy
ah
no
that
is
too
good
to
be
sooth
is
and
sense
into
the
bargain
what
matters
it
to
me
how
i
go
to
rome
nay
nay
you
but
say
so
to
pleasure
me
the
change
is
too
sudden
and
think
me
not
so
as
take
you
at
your
word
also
did
i
not
see
your
eyes
sparkle
at
the
wonders
of
cologne
the
churches
the
images
the
relics
how
dull
art
thou
denys
that
was
when
we
were
to
enjoy
them
together
churches
i
shall
see
plenty
go
how
i
will
the
bones
of
saints
and
martyrs
alas
the
world
is
full
of
them
but
a
friend
like
thee
where
on
earth

shall
i
find
another
no
i
will
not
turn
thee
farther
from
the
road

that
pines
for

will
i
rob

of
thee

my
pearl

fished
thee

must
keep
thee

fever
but
cry

and
lead
on

hey
for

gave
a
joyful
caper
courage

oh

cette
fois
il

decidement
mort

and
they
turned
their
backs
on
the
rhine
on
this
decision
making
itself
clear
across
the
rhine
there
was
a
commotion
in
the
little
party
that
had
been
watching
the
discussion
and
the
friends
had
not
taken
many
steps
ere
a
voice
came
to
them
over
the
water
halt
gerard
turned
and
saw
one
of
those
four
holding
out
a
badge
of
office
and
a
parchment
slip
his
heart
sank
for
he
was
a
good
citizen
and
used
to
obey
the
voice
that
now
bade
him
turn
again
to
dusseldorf
the
law
denys
did
not
share
his
scruples
he
was
a
frenchman
and
despised
every
other
nation
laws
inmates
and
customs
included
he
was
a
soldier
and
took
a
military
view
of
the
situation
superior
force
opposed
river
between
rear
open
why
was
retreat
made
easy
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
boat
still
drifted
in
and
there
was
no
ferry
nearer
than
dusseldorf
i
shall
beat
a
quick
retreat
to
that
hill
said
he
and
then
being
out
of
sight
quick
they
sauntered
off
halt
in
the
bailiff
name
cried
a
voice
from
the
shore
denys
turned
round
and
ostentatiously
snapped
his
fingers
at
the
bailiff
and
proceeded
halt
in
the
archbishop
denys
snapped
his
fingers
at
his
grace
and
proceeded
halt
in
the
emperor
denys
snapped
his
fingers
at
his
majesty
and
proceeded
gerard
saw
this
needless
pantomime
with
regret
and
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
the
brow
of
the
hill
said
there
is
now
but
one
course
we
must
run
to
burgundy
instead
of
walking
and
he
set
off
and
ran
the
best
part
of
a
league
without
stopping
denys
was
fairly
blown
and
inquired
what
on
earth
had
become
of
gerard
fever
i
begin
to
miss
it
sadly
said
he
drily
i
dropped
it
in
rhine
i
trow
was
the
reply
presently
they
came
to
a
little
village
and
here
denys
purchased
a
loaf
and
a
huge
bottle
of
rhenish
wine
for
he
said
we
must
sleep
in
some
hole
or
corner
if
we
lie
at
an
inn
we
shall
be
taken
in
our
this
was
no
more
than
common
prudence
on
the
old
soldier
part
the
official
network
for
catching
especially
plebeian
ones
was
very
close
in
that
age
though
the
of
the
public
was
almost
null
at
all
events
upon
the
continent
the
innkeepers
were
everywhere
under
close
surveillance
as
to
their
travellers
for
whose
acts
they
were
even
in
some
degree
responsible
more
so
it
would
seem
than
for
their
sufferings
the
friends
were
both
glad
when
the
sun
set
and
delighted
when
after
a
long
trudge
under
the
stars
for
the
moon
if
i
remember
right
did
not
rise
till
about
three
in
the
morning
they
came
to
a
large
barn
belonging
to
a
house
at
some
distance
a
quantity
of
barley
had
been
lately
thrashed
for
the
heap
of
straw
on
one
side
the
was
almost
as
high
as
the
unthrashed
corn
on
the
other
here
be
two
royal
beds
said
denys
which
shall
we
lie
on
the
mow
or
the
straw
the
straw
for
me
said
gerard
they
sat
on
the
heap
and
ate
their
brown
bread
and
drank
their
wine
and
then
denys
covered
his
friend
up
in
straw
and
heaped
it
high
above
him
leaving
him
only
a
breathing
hole
water
they
say
is
death
to
fevered
men
i
make
warm
water
o
gerard
bade
him
make
his
mind
easy
these
few
drops
from
rhine
can
not
chill
me
i
feel
heat
enough
in
my
body
now
to
parch
a
kennel
or
boil
a
cloud
if
i
was
in
and
with
this
epigram
his
consciousness
went
so
rapidly
he
might
really
be
said
to
fall
denys
who
lay
awake
awhile
heard
that
which
made
him
nestle
closer
horses
hoofs
came
ringing
up
from
dusseldorf
and
the
wooden
barn
vibrated
as
they
rattled
past
howling
in
a
manner
too
well
known
and
understood
in
the
century
but
as
unfamiliar
in
europe
now
as
a
red
indian
denys
shook
where
he
lay
gerard
slept
like
a
top
it
all
swept
by
and
troop
and
howls
died
away
the
stout
soldier
drew
a
long
breath
whistled
in
a
whisper
closed
his
eyes
and
slept
like
a
top
too
in
the
morning
he
sat
up
and
put
out
his
hand
to
wake
gerard
it
lighted
on
the
young
man
forehead
and
found
it
quite
wet
denys
then
in
his
quality
of
nurse
forbore
to
wake
him
it
is
ill
to
check
sleep
or
sweat
in
a
sick
man
said
he
i
know
that
far
though
i
minced
ape
nor
after
waiting
a
good
hour
he
felt
desperately
hungry
so
he
turned
and
in
went
to
sleep
again
poor
fellow
in
his
hard
life
he
had
been
often
driven
to
this
manoeuvre
at
high
noon
he
was
waked
by
gerard
moving
and
found
him
sitting
up
with
the
straw
smoking
round
him
like
a
animal
heat
versus
moisture
gerard
called
him
a
lazy
he
quietly
grinned
they
set
out
and
the
first
thing
denys
did
was
to
give
gerard
his
arbalest
and
mount
a
high
tree
on
the
road
coast
clear
to
the
next
village
said
he
and
on
they
went
on
drawing
near
the
village
denys
halted
and
suddenly
inquired
of
gerard
how
he
felt
what
can
you
not
see
i
feel
as
if
rome
was
no
further
than
yon
but
thy
body
lad
thy
skin
neither
hot
nor
cold
and
yesterday
was
hot
one
while
and
cold
another
but
what
i
can
not
get
rid
of
is
this
tiresome
le
grand
malheur
many
of
my
comrades
have
found
no
such
ah
there
it
goes
again
itches
unhappy
youth
said
denys
solemnly
the
sum
of
thy
troubles
is
this
thy
fever
is
gone
and
thy
wound
is
healing
sith
so
it
is
added
he
indulgently
i
shall
tell
thee
a
little
piece
of
news
i
had
otherwise
what
asked
gerard
sparkling
with
curiosity
the
hue
and
cry
is
out
after
us
and
on
fleet
oh
chapter
xxix
gerard
was
staggered
by
this
sudden
communication
and
his
colour
came
and
went
then
he
clenched
his
teeth
with
ire
for
men
of
any
spirit
at
all
are
like
the
wild
boar
he
will
run
from
a
superior
force
owing
perhaps
to
his
not
being
an
ass
but
if
you
stick
to
his
heels
too
long
and
too
close
and
in
short
bore
him
he
will
whirl
and
come
tearing
at
a
multitude
of
hunters
and
perhaps
bore
you
gerard
then
set
his
teeth
and
looked
battle
but
the
next
moment
his
countenance
fell
and
he
said
plaintively
and
my
axe
is
in
they
consulted
together
prudence
bade
them
avoid
that
village
hunger
said
buy
hunger
spoke
loudest
prudence
most
convincingly
they
settled
to
strike
across
the
fields
they
halted
at
a
haystack
and
borrowed
two
bundles
of
hay
and
lay
on
them
in
a
dry
ditch
out
of
sight
but
in
nettles
they
sallied
out
in
turn
and
came
back
with
turnips
these
they
munched
at
intervals
in
their
retreat
until
sunset
presently
they
crept
out
shivering
into
the
rain
and
darkness
and
got
into
the
road
on
the
other
side
of
the
village
it
was
a
dismal
night
dark
as
pitch
and
blowing
hard
they
could
neither
see
nor
hear
nor
be
seen
nor
heard
and
for
aught
i
know
passed
like
ghosts
close
to
their
foes
these
they
almost
forgot
in
the
natural
horrors
of
the
black
tempestuous
night
in
which
they
seemed
to
grope
and
hew
their
way
as
in
black
marble
when
the
moon
rose
they
were
many
a
league
from
dusseldorf
but
they
still
trudged
on
presently
they
came
to
a
huge
building
courage
cried
denys
i
think
i
know
this
convent
aye
it
is
we
are
in
the
see
of
juliers
cologne
has
no
power
the
next
moment
they
were
safe
within
the
walls
chapter
xxx
here
gerard
made
acquaintance
with
a
monk
who
had
constructed
the
great
dial
in
the
prior
garden
and
a
wheel
for
drawing
water
and
a
winnowing
machine
for
the
grain
and
had
ever
some
ingenious
mechanism
on
hand
he
had
made
several
psalteries
and
two
dulcimers
and
was
now
attempting
a
set
of
regalles
or
little
organ
for
the
choir
now
gerard
played
the
humble
psaltery
a
little
but
the
monk
touched
that
instrument
divinely
and
showed
him
most
agreeably
what
a
novice
he
was
in
music
he
also
illuminated
finely
but
could
not
write
so
beautifully
as
gerard
comparing
their
acquirements
with
the
earnestness
and
simplicity
of
an
age
in
which
accomplishments
implied
a
true
natural
bent
youth
and
age
soon
became
like
brothers
and
gerard
was
pressed
hard
to
stay
that
night
he
consulted
denys
who
assented
with
a
rueful
shrug
gerard
told
his
old
new
friend
whither
he
was
going
and
described
their
late
adventures
softening
down
the
bolster
alack
said
the
good
old
man
i
have
been
a
great
traveller
in
my
day
but
none
molested
he
then
told
him
to
avoid
inns
they
were
always
haunted
by
rogues
and
roysterers
whence
his
soul
might
take
harm
even
did
his
body
escape
and
to
manage
each
day
journey
so
as
to
lie
at
some
peaceful
monastery
then
suddenly
breaking
off
and
looking
as
sharp
as
a
needle
at
gerard
he
asked
him
how
long
since
he
had
been
shriven
gerard
coloured
up
and
replied
feebly
better
than
a
and
thou
an
exorcist
no
wonder
perils
have
overtaken
thee
come
thou
must
be
assoiled
out
of
yes
father
said
gerard
and
with
all
mine
heart
and
was
sinking
down
to
his
knees
with
his
hands
joined
but
the
monk
stopped
him
half
fretfully
not
to
me
not
to
me
not
to
me
i
am
as
full
of
the
world
as
thou
or
any
be
that
lives
i
my
whole
soul
it
is
in
these
wooden
pipes
and
sorry
leathern
stops
which
shall
perish
with
them
whose
minds
are
fixed
on
such
like
dear
father
said
gerard
they
are
for
the
use
of
the
church
and
surely
that
sanctifies
the
pains
and
labour
spent
on
them
that
is
just
what
the
devil
has
been
whispering
in
mine
ear
this
while
said
the
monk
putting
one
hand
behind
his
back
and
shaking
his
finger
half
threateningly
half
playfully
at
gerard
he
was
even
so
kind
and
thoughtful
as
to
mind
me
that
solomon
built
the
lord
a
house
with
rare
hangings
and
that
this
in
him
was
counted
gracious
and
no
sin
oh
he
can
quote
scripture
rarely
but
i
am
not
so
simple
a
monk
as
you
think
my
lad
cried
the
good
father
with
sudden
defiance
addressing
not
gerard
but
vacancy
this
one
toy
finished
vigils
fasts
and
prayers
for
me
prayers
standing
prayers
lying
on
the
chapel
floor
and
prayers
in
a
right
good
tub
of
cold
he
nudged
gerard
and
winked
his
eye
knowingly
nothing
he
hates
and
dreads
like
seeing
us
monks
at
our
orisons
up
to
our
chins
in
cold
water
for
corpus
domat
aqua
so
now
go
confess
thy
little
trumpery
sins
pardonable
in
youth
and
secularity
and
leave
me
to
mine
sweet
to
me
as
honey
and
to
be
expiated
in
gerard
bowed
his
head
but
could
not
help
saying
where
shall
i
find
a
confessor
more
holy
and
clement
in
each
of
these
cells
replied
the
monk
simply
they
were
now
in
the
corridor
there
go
to
brother
anselm
gerard
followed
the
monk
direction
and
made
for
a
cell
but
the
doors
were
pretty
close
to
one
another
and
it
seems
he
mistook
for
just
as
he
was
about
to
tap
he
heard
his
old
friend
crying
to
him
in
an
agitated
whisper
nay
nay
nay
he
turned
and
there
was
the
monk
at
his
in
a
strange
state
of
anxiety
going
up
and
down
and
beating
the
air
like
a
bottom
sawyer
gerard
really
thought
the
cell
he
was
at
must
be
inhabited
by
some
dangerous
wild
beast
if
not
by
that
personage
whose
presence
in
the
convent
had
been
so
distinctly
proclaimed
he
looked
back
inquiringly
and
went
on
to
the
next
door
then
his
old
friend
nodded
his
head
rapidly
bursting
in
a
moment
into
a
comparatively
blissful
expression
of
face
and
shot
back
into
his
den
he
took
his
turned
it
and
went
to
work
on
his
regalles
and
often
he
looked
up
and
said
to
himself
the
sands
how
swift
they
run
when
the
man
is
bent
over
earthly
father
anselm
was
a
venerable
monk
with
an
ample
head
and
a
face
all
dignity
and
love
therefore
gerard
in
confessing
to
him
and
replying
to
his
gentle
though
searching
questions
could
not
help
thinking
here
is
a
head
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
wonder
whether
you
will
let
me
draw
it
when
i
have
done
and
so
his
own
head
got
confused
and
he
forgot
a
crime
or
two
however
he
did
not
lower
the
bolstering
this
time
nor
was
he
so
uncandid
as
to
detract
from
the
pagan
character
of
the
bolstered
the
penance
inflicted
was
this
he
was
to
enter
the
convent
church
and
prostrating
himself
kiss
the
lowest
step
of
the
altar
three
times
then
kneeling
on
the
floor
to
say
three
paternosters
and
a
credo
this
done
come
back
to
me
on
the
accordingly
his
short
mortification
performed
gerard
returned
and
found
father
anselm
spreading
plaster
after
the
soul
the
body
said
he
know
that
i
am
the
chirurgeon
here
for
want
of
a
better
this
is
going
on
thy
leg
to
cool
it
not
to
burn
it
the
saints
during
the
operation
the
monastic
leech
who
had
naturally
been
interested
by
the
dusseldorf
branch
of
gerard
confession
rather
sided
with
denys
upon
we
dominicans
seldom
let
blood
nowadays
the
lay
leeches
say
is
from
timidity
and
want
of
skill
but
in
sooth
we
have
long
found
that
simples
will
cure
most
of
the
ills
that
can
be
cured
at
all
besides
they
never
kill
in
capable
hands
and
other
remedies
slay
like
thunderbolts
as
for
the
blood
the
vulgate
saith
expressly
it
is
the
life
of
a
man
and
in
medicine
or
law
as
in
divinity
to
be
wiser
than
the
is
to
be
a
fool
moreover
simples
are
mighty
the
little
creature
that
kills
the
poisonous
snake
if
bitten
herself
finds
an
herb
powerful
enough
to
quell
that
poison
though
stronger
and
of
swifter
operation
than
any
mortal
malady
and
we
taught
by
her
wisdom
and
our
own
traditions
still
search
and
try
the
virtues
of
those
plants
the
good
god
hath
strewed
this
earth
with
some
to
feed
men
bodies
some
to
heal
them
only
in
desperate
ills
we
mix
heavenly
with
earthly
virtue
we
steep
the
hair
or
the
bones
of
some
dead
saint
in
the
medicine
and
thus
work
marvellous
think
you
father
it
is
along
of
the
reliques
for
peter
a
floris
a
learned
leech
and
no
pagan
denies
it
what
knows
peter
a
floris
and
what
know
i
i
take
not
on
me
to
say
we
can
command
the
saints
and
will
they
nill
they
can
draw
corporal
virtue
from
their
blest
remains
but
i
see
that
the
patient
drinking
thus
in
faith
is
often
bettered
as
by
a
charm
doubtless
faith
in
the
recipient
is
for
much
in
all
these
cures
but
so
was
ever
a
sick
woman
that
all
the
jewish
leeches
failed
to
cure
did
but
touch
christ
garment
and
was
healed
in
a
moment
had
she
not
touched
that
sacred
piece
of
cloth
she
had
never
been
healed
had
she
without
faith
not
touched
it
only
but
worn
it
to
her
grave
i
trow
she
had
been
none
the
better
but
we
do
ill
to
search
these
things
too
curiously
all
we
see
around
us
calls
for
faith
have
then
a
little
patience
we
shall
soon
know
all
meantime
i
thy
confessor
for
the
nonce
do
strictly
forbid
thee
on
thy
soul
health
to
hearken
learned
lay
folk
on
things
religious
arrogance
is
their
bane
with
it
they
shut
open
door
in
their
own
faces
mind
i
say
learned
laics
unlearned
ones
have
often
been
my
masters
in
humility
and
may
be
thine
thy
wound
is
cared
for
in
three
days
be
but
a
scar
and
now
god
speed
thee
and
the
saints
make
thee
as
good
and
as
happy
as
thou
art
thoughtful
and
gerard
hoped
there
was
no
need
to
part
yet
for
he
was
to
dine
in
the
refectory
but
father
anselm
told
him
with
a
shade
of
regret
just
perceptible
and
no
more
that
he
did
not
leave
his
cell
this
week
being
himself
in
penitence
and
with
this
he
took
gerard
head
delicately
in
both
hands
and
kissed
him
on
the
brow
and
almost
before
the
cell
door
had
closed
on
him
was
back
to
his
pious
offices
gerard
went
away
chilled
to
the
heart
by
the
isolation
of
the
monastic
life
and
saddened
too
alas
he
thought
here
is
a
kind
face
i
must
never
look
to
see
again
on
earth
a
kind
voice
gone
from
mine
ear
and
my
heart
for
ever
there
is
nothing
but
meeting
and
parting
in
this
sorrowful
world
this
pensive
mood
was
interrupted
by
a
young
monk
who
came
for
him
and
took
him
to
the
refectory
there
he
found
several
monks
seated
at
a
table
and
denys
standing
like
a
poker
being
examined
as
to
the
towns
he
should
pass
through
the
friars
then
clubbed
their
knowledge
and
marked
out
the
route
noting
all
the
religious
houses
on
or
near
that
road
and
this
they
gave
gerard
then
supper
and
after
it
the
old
monk
carried
gerard
to
his
cell
and
they
had
an
eager
chat
and
the
friar
incidentally
revealed
the
cause
of
his
pantomime
in
the
corridor
ye
had
fallen
into
brother
jerome
clutches
yon
was
his
is
father
jerome
an
ill
man
then
an
ill
man
and
the
friar
crossed
himself
a
saint
an
anchorite
the
very
pillar
of
this
house
he
had
sent
ye
barefoot
to
loretto
nay
i
forgot
bound
for
italy
the
spiteful
old
saint
upon
earth
had
sent
ye
to
canterbury
or
compostella
but
jerome
was
born
old
and
with
a
cowl
anselm
and
i
were
boys
once
and
wicked
beyond
anything
you
can
imagine
gerard
wore
a
somewhat
incredulous
look
this
keeps
us
humble
more
or
less
and
makes
us
reasonably
lenient
to
youth
and
hot
then
at
gerard
earnest
request
one
more
heavenly
strain
upon
the
psalterion
and
so
to
bed
the
troubled
spirit
calmed
and
the
sore
heart
soothed
i
have
described
in
full
this
day
marked
only
by
contrast
a
day
that
came
like
oil
on
waves
after
so
many
passions
and
perils
because
it
must
stand
in
this
narrative
as
the
representative
of
many
such
days
which
now
succeeded
to
it
for
our
travellers
on
their
weary
way
experienced
that
which
most
of
my
readers
will
find
in
the
longer
journey
of
life
that
stirring
events
are
not
evenly
distributed
over
the
whole
road
but
come
by
fits
and
starts
and
as
it
were
in
clusters
to
some
extent
this
may
be
because
they
draw
one
another
by
links
more
or
less
subtle
but
there
is
more
in
it
than
that
it
happens
so
life
is
an
intermittent
fever
now
all
narrators
whether
of
history
or
fiction
are
compelled
to
slur
these
barren
portions
of
time
or
else
line
trunks
the
practice
however
tends
to
give
the
unguarded
reader
a
wrong
arithmetical
impression
which
there
is
a
particular
reason
for
avoiding
in
these
pages
as
far
as
possible
i
invite
therefore
your
intelligence
to
my
aid
and
ask
you
to
try
and
realize
that
although
there
were
no
more
vivid
adventures
for
a
long
while
one
day
march
succeeded
another
one
monastery
after
another
fed
and
lodged
them
gratis
with
a
welcome
always
charitable
sometimes
genial
and
though
they
met
no
enemy
but
winter
and
rough
weather
antagonists
not
always
contemptible
yet
they
trudged
over
a
much
larger
tract
of
territory
than
that
their
passage
through
which
i
have
described
so
minutely
and
so
the
pair
gerard
bronzed
in
the
face
and
from
head
to
foot
and
denys
with
his
shoes
in
tatters
stiff
and
footsore
both
of
them
drew
near
the
burgundian
frontier
chapter
xxxi
gerard
was
almost
as
eager
for
this
promised
land
as
denys
for
the
latter
constantly
chanted
its
praises
and
at
every
little
annoyance
showed
him
they
did
things
better
in
burgundy
and
above
all
played
on
his
foible
by
guaranteeing
clean
bedclothes
at
the
inns
of
that
polished
nation
i
ask
no
more
the
hollander
would
say
to
think
that
i
have
not
lain
once
in
a
naked
bed
since
i
left
home
when
i
look
at
their
linen
instead
of
doffing
habit
and
hose
it
is
mine
eyes
and
nose
i
would
fain
be
shut
denys
carried
his
love
of
country
so
far
as
to
walk
twenty
leagues
in
shoes
that
had
exploded
rather
than
buy
of
a
german
churl
who
would
throw
all
manner
of
obstacles
in
a
customer
way
his
incivility
his
dinner
his
body
towards
sunset
they
found
themselves
at
equal
distances
from
a
little
town
and
a
monastery
only
the
latter
was
off
the
road
denys
was
for
the
inn
gerard
for
the
convent
denys
gave
way
but
on
condition
that
once
in
burgundy
they
should
always
stop
at
an
inn
gerard
consented
to
this
the
more
readily
that
his
chart
with
its
list
of
convents
ended
here
so
they
turned
off
the
road
and
now
gerard
asked
with
surprise
whence
this
sudden
aversion
to
places
that
had
fed
and
lodged
them
gratis
so
often
the
soldier
hemmed
and
hawed
at
first
but
at
last
his
wrongs
burst
forth
it
came
out
that
this
was
no
sudden
aversion
but
an
ancient
and
abiding
horror
which
he
had
suppressed
till
now
but
with
infinite
difficulty
and
out
of
politeness
i
saw
they
had
put
powder
in
your
drink
said
he
so
i
forbore
them
however
being
the
last
why
not
ease
my
mind
know
then
i
have
been
like
a
fish
out
of
water
in
all
those
great
dungeons
you
straightway
levant
with
some
old
shaveling
so
you
see
not
my
forgive
me
i
have
been
ay
ay
i
forgive
thee
little
one
is
not
thy
fault
art
not
the
first
fool
that
has
been
and
but
i
not
forgive
them
my
then
about
a
century
before
henry
viii
commissioners
he
delivered
his
indictment
these
gloomy
piles
were
all
built
alike
inns
differed
but
here
all
was
monotony
great
gate
little
gate
so
many
steps
and
then
a
gloomy
cloister
here
the
dortour
there
the
great
cold
refectory
where
you
must
sit
mumchance
or
at
least
inaudible
he
who
liked
to
speak
his
mind
out
and
then
said
he
nobody
is
a
man
here
but
all
are
slaves
and
of
what
of
a
peevish
tinkling
bell
that
never
sleeps
an
a
trumpet
now
aye
sounding
alarums
freeze
a
man
heart
so
tinkle
tinkle
tinkle
and
you
must
sit
to
meat
with
may
be
no
stomach
for
food
ere
your
meat
settles
in
your
stomach
tinkle
tinkle
and
ye
must
to
church
with
may
be
no
stomach
for
devotion
i
am
not
a
hog
at
prayers
for
one
tinkle
tinkle
and
now
you
must
to
bed
with
your
eyes
open
well
by
then
you
have
contrived
to
shut
them
some
uneasy
imp
of
darkness
has
got
to
the
and
tinkle
tinkle
it
behoves
you
say
a
prayer
in
the
dark
whether
you
know
one
or
not
if
they
heard
the
sort
of
prayers
i
mutter
when
they
break
my
rest
with
their
tinkle
well
you
drop
off
again
and
get
about
an
eyeful
of
sleep
lo
it
is
tinkle
tinkle
for
and
the
only
clapper
you
love
is
a
woman
put
in
gerard
half
contemptuously
because
there
is
some
music
in
that
even
when
it
scolds
was
the
stout
reply
and
then
to
be
always
checked
if
i
do
but
put
my
finger
in
the
straightway
i
hear
you
no
knife
that
you
finger
the
salt
and
if
i
but
wipe
my
knife
on
the
cloth
to
save
time
then
is
thy
knife
dirty
on
the
bread
and
clean
upon
the
cloth
oh
small
of
soul
these
little
peevish
pedantries
fall
chill
upon
good
fellowship
like
wee
icicles
down
from
strawen
i
hold
cleanliness
no
pedantry
said
gerard
shouldst
learn
better
manners
once
for
nay

they
who
lack
manners
they
stop
a
fellow
mouth
at
every
at
every
other
word
you
mean
every
obscene
or
blasphemous
exaggerator
go
to
why
at
the
very
last
of
these
dungeons
i
found
the
poor
travellers
sitting
all
chilled
and
mute
round
one
shaveling
like
rogues
awaiting
their
turn
to
be
hanged
so
to
cheer
them
up
i
did
but
cry
out
tout
le

le

what
befell

this
not
quo
the
bourreau
say
i
does
he
wheel
and
wyte
on
me
in
a
sort
of
alsatian
french
turning
all
the

i
had
much
ado
not
to
laugh
in
his
being
thyself
unable
to
speak
ten
words
of
his
language
without
a
well
all
the
world
ought
to
speak
french
what
avail
so
many
jargons
except
to
put
a
frontier
atwixt
men
hearts
but
what
said
he
what
signifies
it
what
a
fool
says
oh
not
all
the
words
of
a
fool
are
folly
or
i
should
not
listen
to
well
then
he
said
as
begin
by
making
free
with
the
name
aye
end
by
doing
it
with
all
the
names
in
heaven
said
i
am
a
soldier
and
this
is
but
my
consigne
or
then
it
is
just
a
custom
said
he
i
not
divining
the
old
fox
and
thinking
to
clear
myself
said
it
was
that
is
ten
times
worse
said
he
bring
him
about
your
ears
one
of
these
days
he
still
comes
where
he
hears
his
name
often
called
observe
no
gratitude
for
the
tidings
which
neither
his
missals
nor
his
breviary
had
ever
let
him
know
then
he
was
so
good
as
to
tell
me
soldiers
do
commonly
the
crimes
for
which
all
other
men
are
broke
on
the
wheel
a
savoir
murder
rape
and
and
not
true
true
or
not
it
was
ill
manners
replied
denys
guardedly
and
so
says
this
courteous
host
of
mine
the
foes
of
mankind
why
make
enemies
of
good
spirits
into
the
bargain
by
still
shouting
the
names
of
evil
ones
and
a
lot
more
well
but
denys
whether
you
hearken
his
rede
or
slight
it
wherefore
blame
a
man
for
raising
his
voice
to
save
your
soul
how
can
his
voice
save
my
soul
when
he
keeps
turning
of
his
p
into
gerard
was
staggered
ere
he
could
recover
at
this
thunderbolt
of
gallicism
denys
went
triumphant
off
at
a
tangent
and
stigmatized
all
monks
as
hypocrites
do
but
look
at
them
how
they
creep
about
and
can
not
eye
you
like

said
gerard
eagerly
that
modest
downcast
gaze
is

of
their
discipline

i
thought
so
the
wolf
in
my
stomach
cried
this
last
statement
he
confirmed
with
two
oaths
and
marched
like
a
victorious
gamecock
into
the
convent
thinking
by
gerard
silence
he
had
convinced
him
and
not
dreaming
how
profoundly
he
had
disgusted
him
chapter
xxxii
in
the
refectory
allusion
was
made
at
the
table
where
gerard
sat
to
the
sudden
death
of
the
monk
who
had
undertaken
to
write
out
fresh
copies
of
the
charter
of
the
monastery
and
the
rule
etc
gerard
caught
this
and
timidly
offered
his
services
there
was
a
hesitation
which
he
mistook
nay
not
for
hire
my
lords
but
for
love
and
as
a
trifling
return
for
many
a
good
night
lodging
the
brethren
of
your
order
have
bestowed
on
me
a
poor
a
monk
smiled
approvingly
but
hinted
that
the
late
brother
was
an
excellent
penman
and
his
work
could
not
be
continued
but
by
a
master
gerard
on
this
drew
from
his
wallet
with
some
trepidation
a
vellum
deed
the
back
of
which
he
had
cleaned
and
written
upon
by
way
of
specimen
the
monk
gave
quite
a
start
at
sight
of
it
and
very
hastily
went
up
the
hall
to
the
high
table
and
bending
his
knee
so
as
just
to
touch
in
passing
the
fifth
step
and
the
tenth
or
last
presented
it
to
the
prior
with
comments
instantly
a
dozen
knowing
eyes
were
fixed
on
it
and
a
buzz
of
voices
was
heard
and
soon
gerard
saw
the
prior
point
more
than
once
and
the
monk
came
back
looking
as
proud
as
punch
with
a
savoury
crustade
ryal
or
game
pie
gravied
and
spiced
for
gerard
and
a
silver
grace
cup
full
of
rich
pimentum
this
latter
gerard
took
and
bowing
low
first
to
the
distant
prior
then
to
his
own
company
quaffed
and
circulated
the
cup
instantly
to
his
surprise
the
whole
table
hailed
him
as
a
brother
art
convent
bred
deny
it
not
he
acknowledged
it
and
gave
heaven
thanks
for
it
for
otherwise
he
had
been
as
rude
and
ignorant
as
his
brothers
sybrandt
and
cornelis
but
is
passing
strange
how
you
could
know
said
he
you
drank
with
the
cup
in
both
hands
said
two
monks
speaking
together
the
voices
had
for
some
time
been
loudish
round
a
table
at
the
bottom
of
the
hall
but
presently
came
a
burst
of
mirth
so
obstreperous
and
prolonged
that
the
prior
sent
the
very
all
down
the
hall
to
check
it
and
inflict
penance
on
every
monk
at
the
table
and
cheek
burned
with
shame
for
in
the
heart
of
the
unruly
merriment
his
ear
had
caught
the
word
courage
and
the
trumpet
tones
of
denys
of
burgundy
soon
gerard
was
installed
in
feu
werter
cell
with
wax
lights
and
a
little
frame
that
could
be
set
at
any
angle
and
all
the
materials
of
caligraphy
the
work
however
was
too
much
for
one
evening
then
came
the
question
how
could
he
ask
denys
the
to
stay
longer
however
he
told
him
and
offered
to
abide
by
his
decision
he
was
agreeably
surprised
when
denys
said
graciously
a
day
rest
will
do
neither
of
us
harm
write
thou
and
i
pass
the
time
as
i
gerard
work
was
vastly
admired
they
agreed
that
the
records
of
the
monastery
had
gained
by
poor
werter
death
the
forced
a
on
gerard
and
several
brushes
and
colours
out
of
the
convent
stock
which
was
very
large
he
resumed
his
march
warm
at
heart
for
this
was
of
good
omen
since
it
was
on
the
pen
he
relied
to
make
his
fortune
and
recover
his
come
denys
said
he
see
what
the
good
monks
have
given
me
now
do
try
to
be
fairer
to
them
for
to
be
round
with
you
it
chilled
my
friendship
for
a
moment
to
hear
even
you
call
my
benefactors
i
recant
said
denys
thank
you
thank
you
good
i
was
a
scurrilous
nay
nay
say
not
so
neither
but
we
soldiers
are
rude
and
hasty
i
give
myself
the
lie
and
i
offer
those
i
misunderstood
all
my
esteem
is
unjust
that
thousands
should
be
defamed
for
the
hypocrisy
of
a
now
are
you
reasonable
you
have
pondered
what
i
said
nay
it
is
their
own
gerard
crowed
a
little
we
all
like
to
be
proved
in
the
right
and
was
all
attention
when
denys
offered
to
relate
how
his
conversion
was
effected
well
then
at
dinner
the
first
day
a
young
monk
beside
me
did
open
his
jaws
and
laughed
right
out
and
most
musically
said
i
last
i
have
fallen
on
a
man
and
not
a
shorn
ape
so
to
sound
him
further
i
slapped
his
broad
back
and
administered
my
consigne
forbid
says
he
i
stared
for
the
dog
looked
as
sad
as
solomon
a
better
mime
saw
you
never
even
at
a
mystery
see
war
is
no
sharpener
of
the
wits
said
he
are
the
clergy
for
but
to
fight
the
foul
fiend
and
what
else
are
the
monks
for
the
fiend
being
dead
the
friars
are
you
may
plough
up
the
convents
and
we
poor
monks
shall
have
nought
to
do
but
turn
soldiers
and
so
bring
him
to
life
again
then
there
was
a
great
laugh
at
my
expense
you
are
the
monk
for
me
said
i
you
are
the
crossbowman
for
me
quo
he
i
be
bound
you
could
tell
us
tales
of
the
war
should
make
our
hair
stand
on
end
the
barber
has
put
that
out
of
the
question
quoth
i
and
then
i
had
the
what
wretched
ribaldry
observed
gerard
pensively
the
candid
denys
at
once
admitted
he
had
seen
merrier
jests
hatched
with
less
cackle
was
a
great
matter
to
have
got
rid
of
hypocrisy
said
i
can
give
you
the
chaire
de
poule
if
that
may
content
ye
we
will
see
was
the
cry
and
a
signal
went
denys
then
related
bursting
with
glee
how
at
bedtime
he
had
been
taken
to
a
cell
instead
of
the
great
dortour
and
strictly
forbidden
to
sleep
and
to
aid
his
vigil
a
book
had
been
lent
him
of
pictures
representing
a
hundred
merry
adventures
of
monks
in
pursuit
of
the
female
laity
and
how
in
due
course
he
had
been
taken
out
barefooted
and
down
to
the
parlour
where
was
a
supper
fit
for
the
duke
and
at
it
twelve
jolly
friars
the
roaringest
boys
he
had
ever
met
in
peace
or
war
how
the
story
the
toast
the
jest
the
had
gone
round
and
some
had
played
cards
with
a
gorgeous
pack
where
saint
theresa
and
saint
catherine
bedizened
with
gold
stood
for
the
four
queens
and
black
white
grey
and
crutched
friars
for
the
four
knaves
and
had
staked
their
very
rosaries
swearing
like
troopers
when
they
lost
and
how
about
midnight
a
sly
monk
had
stolen
out
but
had
by
him
and
others
been
as
cannily
followed
into
the
garden
and
seen
to
thrust
his
hand
into
the
ivy
and
out
with
a
with
this
he
had
run
up
on
the
wall
which
was
ten
feet
broad
yet
not
so
nimbly
but
what
a
russet
kirtle
had
popped
up
from
the
outer
world
as
quick
as
he
and
so
to
billing
and
cooing
that
this
situation
had
struck
him
as
rather
feline
than
ecclesiastical
and
drawn
from
him
the
appropriate
comment
of
a
mew
the
monks
had
joined
the
mewsical
chorus
and
the
lay
visitor
shrieked
and
been
sore
discomforted
but
abelard
only
cried
what
are
ye
there
ye
jealous
miauling
knaves
ye
shall
caterwaul
to
some
tune
night
i
fit
every
of
ye
with
a
that
this
brutal
threat
had
reconciled
him
to
stay
another
day
at
request
gerard
groaned
meantime
unable
to
disconcert
so
brazen
a
monk
and
the
demoiselle
beginning
to
whimper
they
had
danced
caterwauling
in
a
circle
then
bestowed
a
solemn
benediction
on
the
two
and
off
to
the
parlour
where
they
found
a
pair
lying
dead
drunk
and
other
two
affectionate
to
tears
that
they
had
straightway
carried
off
the
inanimate
and
dragged
off
the
loving
and
lachymose
kicked
them
all
merrily
each
into
his
cell
and
so
shut
up
in
measureless
gerard
was
disgusted
and
said
so
denys
chuckled
and
proceeded
to
tell
him
how
the
next
day
he
and
the
young
monks
had
drawn
the
and
secreted
much
pike
carp
tench
and
eel
for
their
own
use
and
how
in
the
dead
of
night
he
had
been
taken
shoeless
by
crooked
ways
into
the
chapel
a
place
being
dark
and
then
down
some
steps
into
a
crypt
below
the
chapel
floor
where
suddenly
paradise
had
burst
on
him
is
there
the
holy
fathers
retire
to
pray
put
in
gerard
not
always
said
denys
wax
candles
by
the
dozen
were
lighted
and
princely
cheer
fifteen
soups
maigre
with
marvellous
twangs
of
venison
grouse
and
hare
in
them
and
twenty
different
fishes
being
friday
cooked
with
wondrous
art
and
each
he
between
two
buxom
lasses
and
each
lass
between
two
lads
with
a
cowl
all
but
me
and
to
think
i
had
to
woo
by
interpreter
i
doubt
the
knave
put
in
three
words
for
himself
and
one
for
me
if
he
did
hang
him
for
a
fool
and
some
of
the
weaker
vessels
were
novices
and
not
wont
to
hold
good
wine
had
to
be
coaxed
ere
they
would
put
it
to
their
white
teeth
mais
elles
faisaient
and
the
story
and
the
jest
and
the
cup
went
round
they
had
flagons
made
to
simulate
breviaries
and
a
monk
touched
the
cittern
and
sang
ditties
with
a
voice
tunable
as
a
lark
in
spring
the
posies
did
turn
the
faces
of
the
women
folk
bright
red
at
first
but
elles
here
gerard
exploded
miserable
wretches
corrupters
of
youth
perverters
of
innocence
but
for
your
being
there
denys
who
have
been
taught
no
better
oh
would
god
the
church
had
fallen
on
the
whole
gang
impious
abominable
hypocrites
hypocrites
cried
denys
with
unfeigned
surprise
why
that
is
what
i
clept
them
ere
i
knew
them
and
you
withstood
me
nay
they
are
sinners
all
good
fellows
are
that
but
by
denys
his
helmeted
skull
no
hypocrites
but
right
jolly
roaring
denys
said
gerard
solemnly
you
little
know
the
peril
you
ran
that
night
that
church
you
defiled
amongst
you
is
haunted
i
had
it
from
one
of
the
elder
monks
the
dead
walk
there
their
light
feet
have
been
heard
to
patter
the
misericorde
whispered
denys
ay
more
said
gerard
lowering
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
celestial
sounds
have
issued
from
the
purlieus
of
that
very
crypt
you
turned
into
a
tavern
voices
of
the
dead
holding
unearthly
communion
have
chilled
the
ear
of
midnight
and
at
times
denys
the
faithful
in
their
nightly
watches
have
even
heard
music
from
dead
lips
and
chords
made
by
no
mortal
finger
swept
by
no
mortal
hand
have
rung
faintly
like
echoes
deep
among
the
dead
in
those
sacred
denys
wore
a
look
of
dismay
ugh
if
i
had
known
mules
and
had
not
hauled
me
thither
and
so
with
a
sigh
i
had
lost
a
merry
whether
further
discussion
might
have
thrown
any
more
light
upon
these
ghostly
sounds
who
can
tell
for
up
came
a
bearded
brother
from
the
monastery
spurring
his
mule
and
waving
a
piece
of
vellum
in
his
hand
it
was
the
deed
between
ghysbrecht
and
floris
brandt
gerard
valued
it
deeply
as
a
remembrance
of
home
he
turned
pale
at
first
but
to
think
he
had
so
nearly
lost
it
and
to
denys
infinite
amusement
not
only
gave
a
piece
of
money
to
the
lay
brother
but
kissed
the
mule
nose
i
read
you
now
said
gerard
were
you
twice
as
ill
written
and
to
make
sure
of
never
losing
you
here
he
sat
down
and
taking
out
needle
and
thread
sewed
it
with
feminine
dexterity
to
his
doublet
and
his
mind
and
heart
and
soul
were
away
to
sevenbergen
they
reached
the
promised
land
and
denys
who
was
in
high
spirits
doffed
his
bonnet
to
all
the
females
who
curtsied
and
smiled
in
return
fired
his
consigne
at
most
of
the
men
at
which
some
stared
some
grinned
some
both
and
finally
landed
his
friend
at
one
of
the
burgundian
inns
it
is
a
little
one
said
he
but
i
know
it
of
old
for
a
good
one
les
trois
poissons
but
what
is
this
writ
up
i
mind
not
this
and
he
pointed
to
an
inscription
that
ran
across
the
whole
building
in
a
single
line
of
huge
letters
oh
i
see
on
loge
a
pied
et
a
cheval
said
denys
going
minutely
through
the
inscription
and
looking
bumptious
when
he
had
effected
it
gerard
did
look
and
the
sentence
in
question
ran
thus

they
met
the
landlord
in
the
passage
welcome
messieurs
said
he
taking
off
his
cap
with
a
low
bow
come
we
are
not
in
germany
said
gerard
in
the
public
room
they
found
the
mistress
a
buxom
woman
of
forty
she
curtsied
to
them
and
smiled
right
cordially
give
yourself
the
trouble
of
sitting
ye
down
fair
sir
said
she
to
gerard
and
dusted
two
chairs
with
her
apron
not
that
they
needed
it
thank
you
dame
said
gerard
well
thought
he
this
is
a
polite
nation
the
trouble
of
sitting
down
that
will
i
with
singular
patience
and
presently
the
labour
of
eating
also
the
toil
of
digestion
and
finally
by
hercules
his
aid
the
strain
of
going
to
bed
and
the
struggle
of
sinking
fast
asleep
why
denys
what
are
you
doing
ordering
supper
for
only
two
why
not
what
can
we
sup
without
waiting
for
forty
more
burgundy
forever
aha
courage
camarade

the
salic
law
seemed
not
to
have
penetrated
to
french
inns
in
this
one
at
least
wimple
and
kirtle
reigned
supreme
doublets
and
hose
were
few
in
number
and
feeble
in
act
the
landlord
himself
wandered
objectless
eternally
taking
off
his
cap
to
folk
for
want
of
thought
and
the
women
as
they
passed
him
in
turn
thrust
him
quietly
aside
without
looking
at
him
as
we
remove
a
live
twig
in
bustling
through
a
wood
a
maid
brought
in
supper
and
the
mistress
followed
her
empty
handed
fall
to
my
masters
said
she
cheerily
but
one
enemy
here
and
he
lies
under
your
i
shrewdly
suspect
this
of
formula
they
fell
to
the
mistress
drew
her
chair
a
little
toward
the
table
and
provided
company
as
well
as
meat
gossiped
genially
with
them
like
old
acquaintances
but
this
form
gone
through
the
busy
dame
was
soon
off
and
sent
in
her
daughter
a
beautiful
young
woman
of
about
twenty
who
took
the
vacant
seat
she
was
not
quite
so
broad
and
genial
as
the
elder
but
gentle
and
cheerful
and
showed
a
womanly
tenderness
for
gerard
on
learning
the
distance
the
poor
boy
had
come
and
had
to
go
she
stayed
nearly
and
when
she
left
them
gerard
said
this
an
inn
why
it
is
like
qui
fit
francois
il
fit
courtois
said
denys
bursting
with
gratified
pride
courteous
nay
christian
to
welcome
us
like
home
guests
and
old
friends
us
vagrants
here
and
gone
but
indeed
who
better
merits
pity
and
kindness
than
the
worn
traveller
far
from
his
folk
hola
here
the
was
the
chambermaid
a
woman
of
about
with
a
cocked
nose
a
large
laughing
mouth
and
a
sparkling
black
eye
and
a
bare
arm
very
stout
but
not
very
shapely
the
moment
she
came
in
one
of
the
travellers
passed
a
somewhat
free
jest
on
her
the
next
the
whole
company
were
roaring
at
his
expense
so
swiftly
had
her
practised
tongue
done
his
business
even
as
in
a
passage
of
arms
between
a
novice
and
a
master
of
fence
foils
clash
novice
pinked
on
this
another
and
then
another
must
break
a
lance
with
her
but
marion
stuck
her
great
arms
upon
her
haunches
and
held
the
whole
room
in
play
this
country
girl
possessed
in
perfection
that
rude
and
ready
humour
which
looks
mean
and
vulgar
on
paper
but
carries
all
before
it
spoken
not
wit
rapier
its
bludgeon
nature
had
done
much
for
her
in
this
way
and
daily
practice
in
an
inn
the
rest
yet
shall
she
not
be
photographed
by
me
but
feebly
indicated
for
it
was
just
four
hundred
years
ago
the
raillery
was
coarse
she
returned
every
stroke
in
kind
and
though
a
virtuous
woman
said
things
without
winking
which
no
decent
man
of
our
day
would
say
even
among
men
gerard
sat
gaping
with
astonishment
this
was
to
him
almost
a
new
variety
of
that
interesting
species
homo
he
whispered
denys
now
i
see
why
you
frenchmen
say
woman
tongue
is
her
sword
just
then
she
levelled
another
assailant
and
the
chivalrous
denys
to
console
and
support
the
weaker
vessel
the
iron
kettle
among
the
clay
pots
administered
his
consigne

she
turned
on
him
directly
how
can
he
be
dead
as
long
as
there
is
an
archer
left
alive
general
laughter
at
her
ally
expense
it
is
day
my
masters
said
she
with
sudden
gravity
apres
we
travellers
can
not
strip
and
go
bare
while
you
wash
our
clothes
objected
a
peevish
old
fellow
by
the
fireside
who
had
kept
mumchance
during
the
raillery
but
crept
out
into
the
sunshine
of
commonplaces
i
aimed
not
your
way
ancient
man
replied
marion
superciliously
but
since
you
ask
me
here
she
scanned
him
slowly
from
head
to
foot
i
trow
you
might
take
a
turn
in
the
tub
clothes
and
all
and
no
harm
done
laughter
but
what
i
spoke
for
i
thought
this
young
sire
might
like
his
beard
poor
gerard
turn
had
come
his
chin
crop
was
thin
and
silky
the
loudest
of
all
the
laughers
this
time
was
the
traitor
denys
whose
beard
was
of
a
good
length
and
singularly
stiff
and
bristly
so
that
shakespeare
though
he
never
saw
him
hit
him
in
the
bull
eye
full
of
strange
oaths
and
bearded
like
the
as
you
like
it
gerard
bore
the
amazonian
satire
mighty
calmly
he
had
little
personal
vanity
nay
said
he
with
a
smile
mine
is
all
unworthy
your
pains
take
you
this
fair
growth
in
hand
and
he
pointed
to
denys
vegetable
oh
time
for
that
when
i
starch
the
whilst
they
were
all
shouting
over
this
palpable
hit
the
mistress
returned
and
in
no
more
time
than
it
took
her
to
cross
the
threshold
did
our
amazon
turn
to
a
seeming
madonna
meek
and
mild
mistresses
are
wonderful
subjugators
their
like
i
think
breathes
not
on
the
globe
housemaids
decide
it
was
a
waste
of
histrionic
ability
though
for
the
landlady
had
heard
and
did
not
at
heart
disapprove
the
peals
of
laughter
ah
marion
lass
said
she
if
you
laid
me
an
egg
every
time
you
cackle
trois
poissons
would
never
lack
an
now
dame
said
gerard
what
is
to
pay
what
for
our
where
is
the
hurry
can
not
you
be
content
to
pay
when
you
go
lose
the
guest
find
the
money
is
the
rule
of
three
fish
but
dame
outside
three
fish
it
is
thus
written
ne
loge
bah
let
that
flea
stick
on
the
wall
look
hither
and
she
pointed
to
the
smoky
ceiling
which
was
covered
with
hieroglyphics
these
were
accounts
vulgo
scores
intelligible
to
this
dame
and
her
daughter
who
wrote
them
at
need
by
simply
mounting
a
low
stool
and
scratching
with
a
knife
so
as
to
show
lines
of
ceiling
through
the
deposit
of
smoke
the
dame
explained
that
the
writing
on
the
wall
was
put
there
to
frighten
moneyless
folk
from
the
inn
altogether
or
to
be
acted
on
at
odd
times
when
a
face
should
come
in
and
insist
on
being
served
we
ca
refuse
them
plump
you
know
the
law
forbids
and
how
know
you
mine
is
not
such
a
face
out
fie
it
is
the
best
face
that
has
entered
three
fish
this
and
mine
dame
said
denys
dost
see
no
knavery
here
she
eyed
him
calmly
not
such
a
good
one
as
the
lad
nor
ever
will
be
but
it
is
the
face
of
a
true
man
for
all
that
added
she
drily
an
i
were
ten
years
younger
i
as
lieve
not
meet
that
face
on
a
dark
night
too
far
from
gerard
stared
denys
laughed
why
dame
i
would
but
sip
the
night
dew
off
the
flower
and
you
need
take
ten
years
off
nor
ten
days
to
be
worth
risking
a
scratched
face
there
our
mistress
said
marion
who
had
just
come
in
said
i
not
day
you
could
make
a
fool
of
them
still
an
if
you
were
properly
minded
i
dare
say
ye
did
it
sounds
like
some
daft
wench
dame
said
gerard
this
is
what
oh
no
no
that
is
no
wonder
at
all
why
i
have
been
here
all
my
life
and
reading
faces
is
the
first
thing
a
girl
picks
up
in
an
marion
and
frying
eggs
the
second
no
telling
lies
frying
eggs
is
the
third
the
mistress
and
holding
her
tongue
the
last
and
modesty
the
day
after
never
at
marion
alack
talk
of
my
tongue
but
i
say
no
more
she
under
whose
wing
i
live
now
deals
the
blow
i
sped
is
but
a
chambermaid
gone
catch
what
left
o
and
she
staggered
and
sank
backwards
on
to
the
handsomest
fellow
in
the
room
which
happened
to
be
gerard
tic
tic
cried
he
peevishly
there
do
be
stupid
that
is
too
heavy
a
jest
for
me
see
you
not
i
am
talking
to
the
mistress
marion
resumed
her
elasticity
with
a
grimace
made
two
little
bounds
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
there
turned
a
pirouette
there
mistress
said
she
i
give
in
is
you
that
reigns
supreme
with
the
men
leastways
with
male
young
man
said
the
mistress
this
girl
is
not
so
stupid
as
her
deportment
in
reading
of
faces
and
frying
of
omelets
there
we
are
great
be
hard
if
we
failed
at
these
arts
since
they
are
about
all
we
do
you
do
not
quite
take
me
dame
said
gerard
that
honesty
in
a
face
should
shine
forth
to
your
experienced
eye
that
seems
reasonable
but
how
by
looking
on
denys
here
could
you
learn
his
one
little
foible
his
insanity
his
miserable
mulierosity
poor
gerard
got
angrier
the
more
he
thought
of
it
his
mule
his
what
crossing
herself
with
superstitious
awe
at
the
polysyllable
nay
is
but
the
word
i
was
fain
to
invent
for
invent
what
can
a
child
like
you
make
other
words
than
grow
in
burgundy
by
nature
take
heed
what
ye
do
why
we
are
overrun
with
them
already
especially
bad
ones
lord
these
be
times
i
look
to
hear
of
a
new
thistle
invented
well
then
dame
mulierose
that
means
wrapped
up
body
and
soul
in
women
so
prithee
tell
me
how
did
you
ever
detect
the
mulierosity
alas
good
youth
you
make
a
mountain
of
a
molehill
we
that
are
women
be
and
out
of
the
tail
of
our
eye
see
more
than
most
men
can
glaring
through
a
prospect
glass
whiles
i
move
to
and
fro
doing
this
and
that
my
glance
is
still
on
my
guests
and
i
did
notice
that
this
soldier
eyes
were
never
off
the
womenfolk
my
daughter
or
marion
or
even
an
old
woman
like
me
all
was
gold
to
him
and
there
a
sat
glowering
oh
you
foolish
foolish
man
now
you
still
turned
to
the
speaker
her
or
him
and
that
is
common
denys
burst
into
a
hoarse
laugh
you
never
were
more
out
why
this
silky
companion
is
a
very
turk
all
but
his
beard
he
is
what
d
call
oser
than
ere
an
archer
in
the
duke
he
is
more
wrapped
up
in
one
single
dutch
lass
called
margaret
than
i
am
in
the
whole
bundle
of
ye
brown
and
man
alive
that
is
just
the
contrary
said
the
hostess
yourn
is
the
bane
and
hisn
the
cure
cling
you
still
to
margaret
my
dear
i
hope
she
is
an
honest
dame
she
is
an
ay
ay
they
are
all
that
till
better
acquainted
i
as
lieve
have
her
no
more
than
honest
and
then
she
will
serve
to
keep
you
out
of
worse
company
as
for
you
soldier
there
is
trouble
in
store
for
you
your
eyes
were
never
made
for
the
good
of
your
nor
of
his
pouch
either
said
marion
striking
in
and
his
lips
they
will
sip
the
dew
as
he
calls
it
off
many
a
bramble
overmuch
clack
marion
overmuch
ods
bodikins
mistress
ye
did
hire
me
to
be
one
o
your
three
fishes
did
ye
and
marion
sulked
thirty
seconds
is
that
the
way
to
speak
to
our
mistress
remonstrated
the
landlord
who
had
slipped
in
hold
your
whisht
said
his
wife
sharply
it
is
not
your
business
to
check
the
girl
she
is
a
good
servant
to
what
is
the
cock
never
to
crow
and
the
hens
at
it
all
day
you
can
crow
as
loud
as
you
like
my
man
out
o
doors
but
the
hen
means
to
rule
the
i
know
a
byword
to
that
said
gerard
do
ye
now
out
femme
veut
en
toute
saison
estre
dame
en
sa
i
never
heard
it
afore
but
is
as
sooth
as
gospel
ay
they
that
set
these
bywords
a
rolling
had
eyes
and
tongues
and
tongues
and
eyes
before
all
the
world
give
me
an
old
and
me
a
young
husband
said
marion
now
there
was
a
chance
for
you
all
and
nobody
spoke
oh
it
is
too
late
now
i
changed
my
all
the
better
for
some
poor
fellow
suggested
denys
and
now
the
arrival
of
the
young
mistress
or
as
she
was
called
the
little
mistress
was
the
signal
for
them
all
to
draw
round
the
fire
like
one
happy
family
travellers
host
hostess
and
even
servants
in
the
outer
ring
and
tell
stories
till
bedtime
and
gerard
in
his
turn
told
a
tremendous
one
out
of
his
repertory
a
collection
of
acts
of
the
saints
and
made
them
all
shudder
deliciously
but
soon
after
began
to
nod
exhausted
by
the
effort
i
should
say
the
young
mistress
saw
and
gave
marion
a
look
she
instantly
lighted
a
rush
and
laying
her
hand
on
gerard
shoulder
invited
him
to
follow
her
she
showed
him
a
room
where
were
two
nice
white
beds
and
bade
him
choose
either
is
paradise
said
he
i
take
this
one
do
you
know
i
have
not
lain
in
a
naked
bed
once
since
i
left
my
home
in
alack
poor
soul
said
she
well
then
the
sooner
my
flax
and
your
down
he
he
come
together
the
better
so
allons
and
she
held
out
her
cheek
as
as
if
it
had
been
her
hand
for
a
fee
allons
what
does
that
mean
it
means
ahem
what
do
they
salute
the
chambermaid
in
your
part
not
all
in
a
what
do
they
make
a
business
o
nay
perverter
of
words
i
mean
we
make
not
so
free
with
strange
women
they
must
be
strange
women
if
they
do
not
think
you
strange
fools
then
here
is
a
coil
why
all
the
old
greasy
greybeards
that
lie
at
our
inn
do
kiss
us
chambermaids
faugh
and
what
have
we
poor
wretches
to
set
on
side
the
compt
but
now
and
then
a
nice
young
alack
time
flies
chambermaids
ca
be
spared
long
in
the
nursery
so
how
to
be
a
please
you
arrange
with
my
comrade
for
both
he
is
mulierose
i
am
nay
is
the
curb
he
will
want
not
the
spur
well
well
you
shall
to
bed
without
paying
the
usual
toll
and
oh
but
is
sweet
to
fall
in
with
a
young
man
who
can
withstand
these
ancient
ill
customs
and
gainsay
brazen
hussies
shalt
have
thy
thank
you
but
what
are
you
doing
with
my
bed
me
oh
only
taking
off
these
sheets
and
going
to
put
on
the
pair
the
drunken
miller
slept
in
last
oh
no
no
you
cruel
thing
there
there
a
la
bonne
heure
what
will
not
perseverance
effect
but
note
now
the
frowardness
of
a
mad
wench
i
cared
not
a
button
i
am
dead
sick
of
that
sport
this
five
years
but
you
denied
me
so
then
forthwith
i
behoved
to
have
it
belike
had
gone
through
fire
and
water
alas
young
sir
we
women
are
kittle
cattle
poor
perverse
toads
excuse
us
and
keep
us
in
our
place
savoir
at
arm
length
and
so
at
the
door
she
turned
and
said
with
a
complete
change
of
tone
and
manner
the
virgin
guard
thy
head
and
the
holy
evangelists
watch
the
bed
where
lies
a
poor
young
wanderer
far
from
home
amen
and
the
next
moment
he
heard
her
run
tearing
down
the
stairs
and
soon
a
peal
of
laughter
from
the
salle
betrayed
her
whereabouts
now
that
is
a
character
said
gerard
profoundly
and
yawned
over
the
discovery
in
a
very
few
minutes
he
was
in
a
dry
bath
of
cold
clean
linen
inexpressibly
refreshing
to
him
after
so
long
disuse
then
came
a
delicious
glow
and
then
sevenbergen
in
the
morning
gerard
awoke
infinitely
refreshed
and
was
for
rising
but
found
himself
a
close
prisoner
his
linen
had
vanished
now
this
was
paralysis
for
the
nightgown
is
a
recent
institution
in
century
and
indeed
long
after
men
did
not
play
fast
and
loose
with
clean
sheets
when
they
could
get
them
but
crept
into
them
clothed
with
their
innocence
like
adam
out
of
bed
they
seem
to
have
taken
most
after
his
eldest
son
gerard
bewailed
his
captivity
to
denys
but
that
instant
the
door
opened
and
in
sailed
marion
with
their
linen
newly
washed
and
ironed
on
her
two
arms
and
set
it
down
on
the
table
oh
you
good
girl
cried
gerard
alack
have
you
found
me
out
at
last
yes
indeed
is
this
another
custom
nay
not
to
take
them
unbidden
but
at
night
we
aye
question
travellers
are
they
for
linen
washed
so
i
came
into
you
but
you
were
both
sound
then
said
i
to
the
little
mistress
where
is
the
sense
of
waking
wearied
men
them
is
charles
the
great
dead
and
would
they
liever
carry
foul
linen
or
clean
especially
this
one
with
a
skin
like
cream
so
he
has
i
declare
said
the
young
that
was
me
remarked
denys
with
the
air
of
a
commentator
guess
once
more
and
you
hit
the
notice
him
not
marion
he
is
an
impudent
fellow
and
i
am
sure
we
can
not
be
grateful
enough
for
your
goodness
and
i
am
sorry
i
ever
refused
you
anything
you
fancied
you
should
oh
are
ye
there
said
i
take
that
to
mean
you
would
fain
brush
the
morning
dew
off
as
your
bashful
companion
calls
it
well
then
excuse
me
is
customary
but
not
prudent
i
decline
quits
with
you
stop
stop
cried
denys
as
she
was
making
off
victorious
i
am
curious
to
know
how
many
of
ye
were
here
last
night
your
eyes
on
us
twain
was
so
satisfactory
a
feast
as
we
were
half
a
minute
who
why
the
big
mistress
the
little
mistress
janet
and
me
and
the
whole
posse
comitatus
on
tiptoe
we
mostly
make
our
rounds
the
last
thing
not
to
get
burned
down
and
in
prodigious
numbers
somehow
that
maketh
us
bolder
especially
where
archers
lie
scattered
why
did
not
you
tell
me
i
have
lain
beau
sire
the
saying
goes
that
the
good
and
the
ill
are
all
one
while
their
lids
are
closed
so
we
said
is
one
who
will
serve
god
best
asleep
break
not
his
rest
she
is
funny
said
gerard
dictatorially
i
must
be
either
that
or
how
so
because
three
fish
pay
me
to
be
funny
you
will
eat
before
you
part
good
then
i
go
see
the
meat
be
fit
for
such
worshipful
denys
what
is
your
will
i
wish
that
was
a
great
boy
and
going
along
with
us
to
keep
us
so
do
not
i
but
i
wish
it
was
going
along
with
us
as
it
now
heaven
forefend
a
fine
fool
you
would
make
of
they
broke
their
fast
settled
their
score
and
said
farewell
then
it
was
they
found
that
marion
had
not
exaggerated
the
custom
of
the
the
three
principal
women
took
and
kissed
them
right
heartily
and
they
kissed
the
three
principal
women
the
landlord
took
and
kissed
them
and
they
kissed
the
landlord
and
the
cry
was
come
back
the
sooner
the
better
never
pass
three
fish
should
your
purses
be
void
bring
yourselves
sieur
credit
is
not
dead
for
and
they
took
the
road
again
they
came
to
a
little
town
and
denys
went
to
buy
shoes
the
shopkeeper
was
in
the
doorway
but
wide
awake
he
received
denys
with
a
bow
down
to
the
ground
the
customer
was
soon
fitted
and
followed
to
the
street
and
dismissed
with
graceful
salutes
from
the
doorstep
the
friends
agreed
it
was
elysium
to
deal
with
such
a
shoemaker
as
this
not
but
what
my
german
shoes
have
lasted
well
enough
said
gerard
the
just
outside
the
town
was
a
pebbled
walk
this
is
to
keep
the
burghers
feet
dry
o
sundays
with
their
wives
and
daughters
said
denys
those
simple
words
of
denys
one
stroke
of
a
careless
tongue
painted
home
in
gerard
heart
oh
how
sweet
said
he
mercy
what
is
this
a
gibbet
and
ugh
two
skeletons
thereon
oh
denys
what
a
sorry
sight
to
woo
by
nay
said
denys
a
comfortable
sight
for
every
rogue
i
the
air
there
is
one
the
less
a
little
farther
on
they
came
to
two
pillars
and
between
these
was
a
huge
wheel
closely
studded
with
iron
prongs
and
entangled
in
these
were
bones
and
fragments
of
cloth
miserably
dispersed
over
the
wheel
gerard
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
oh
to
think
those
patches
and
bones
are
all
that
is
left
of
a
man
of
one
who
was
what
we
are
excusez
a
thing
that
went
on
two
legs
and
stole
are
we
no
more
than
that
how
know
ye
he
stole
have
true
men
never
suffered
death
and
torture
too
none
of
my
kith
ever
found
their
way
to
the
gibbet
i
the
better
their
luck
prithee
how
died
the
saints
hard
but
not
in
ye
massacred
them
wholesale
at
lyons
and
that
is
on
threshold
to
you
the
gibbet
proves
the
crime
because
you
read
not
story
alas
had
you
stood
on
calvary
that
bloody
day
we
sigh
for
to
this
hour
i
tremble
to
think
you
had
perhaps
shouted
for
joy
at
the
gibbet
builded
there
for
the
cross
was
but
the
roman
gallows
father
martin
the
blaspheming
old
hound
oh
fie
fie
a
holy
and
a
man
ay
denys
read
them
that
suffered
there
by
the
bare
light
of
the
gibbet
in
the
nails
cried
in
the
spear
here
be
three
malefactors
three
yet
of
those
little
three
one
was
the
first
christian
saint
and
another
was
the
saviour
of
the
world
which
gibbeted
denys
assured
him
on
his
honour
they
managed
things
better
in
burgundy
he
added
too
after
profound
reflection
that
the
horrors
gerard
had
alluded
to
had
more
than
once
made
him
curse
and
swear
with
rage
when
told
by
the
good
cure
in
his
native
village
at
eastertide
but
they
chanced
in
an
outlandish
nation
and
near
a
thousand
years
agone
mort
de
ma
vie
let
us
hope
it
is
not
true
or
at
least
sore
exaggerated
do
but
see
how
all
tales
gather
as
they
roll
then
he
reflected
again
and
all
in
a
moment
turned
red
with
ire
do
ye
not
blush
to
play
with
your
on
your
unlettered
friend
and
throw
dust
in
his
eyes
evening
the
saints
with
these
reptiles
then
suddenly
he
recovered
his
good
humour
since
your
heart
beats
for
vermin
feel
for
the
carrion
crows
they
be
as
good
vermin
as
these
would
ye
send
them
to
bed
supperless
poor
pretty
poppets
why
these
be
their
larder
the
pangs
of
hunger
would
gnaw
them
dead
but
for
cold
hung
up
here
and
gerard
who
had
for
some
time
maintained
a
dead
silence
informed
him
the
subject
was
closed
between
them
and
for
ever
there
are
things
said
he
in
which
our
hearts
seem
wide
as
the
poles
asunder
and
eke
our
heads
but
i
love
thee
dearly
all
the
same
he
added
with
infinite
grace
and
tenderness
towards
afternoon
they
heard
a
faint
wailing
noise
on
ahead
it
grew
distincter
as
they
proceeded
being
fast
walkers
they
soon
came
up
with
its
cause
a
score
of
pikemen
accompanied
by
several
constables
were
marching
along
and
in
advance
of
them
was
a
herd
of
animals
they
were
driving
these
creatures
in
number
rather
more
than
a
hundred
were
of
various
ages
only
very
few
were
downright
old
the
males
were
downcast
and
silent
it
was
the
females
from
whom
all
the
outcry
came
in
other
words
the
animals
thus
driven
along
at
the
law
point
were
men
and
women
good
heaven
cried
gerard
what
a
band
of
them
but
stay
surely
all
those
children
can
not
be
thieves
why
there
are
some
in
arms
what
on
earth
is
this
denys
denys
advised
him
to
ask
that
bourgeois
with
the
badge
this
is
burgundy
here
a
civil
question
ever
draws
a
civil
gerard
went
up
to
the
officer
and
removing
his
cap
a
civility
which
was
immediately
returned
said
for
our
lady
sake
sir
what
do
ye
with
these
poor
folk
nay
what
is
that
to
you
my
lad
replied
the
functionary
suspiciously
master
i
a
stranger
and
athirst
for
that
is
another
matter
what
are
we
doing
ahem
why
we
dost
hear
jacques
here
is
a
stranger
seeks
to
know
what
we
are
doing
and
the
two
machines
were
tickled
that
there
should
be
a
man
who
did
not
know
something
they
happened
to
know
in
all
ages
this
has
tickled
however
the
chuckle
was
brief
and
moderated
by
the
native
courtesy
and
the
official
turned
to
gerard
again
what
we
are
doing
hum
and
now
he
hesitated
not
from
any
doubt
as
to
what
he
was
doing
but
because
he
was
hunting
for
a
single
word
that
should
convey
the
matter
ce
que
nous
faisons
mon
gars
mais
dam
nous
you
decant
that
should
mean
you
pour
from
one
vessel
to
he
explained
that
last
year
the
town
of
charmes
had
been
sore
thinned
by
a
pestilence
whole
houses
emptied
and
trades
short
of
hands
much
ado
to
get
in
the
rye
and
the
flax
half
spoiled
so
the
bailiff
and
aldermen
had
written
to
the
duke
secretary
and
the
duke
he
sent
far
and
wide
to
know
what
town
was
too
full
that
are
we
had
the
baillie
of
toul
writ
back
then
send
four
or
five
score
of
your
townsfolk
was
the
order
was
not
this
to
decant
the
full
town
into
the
empty
and
is
not
the
good
duke
the
father
of
his
people
and
will
not
let
the
duchy
be
weakened
nor
its
fair
towns
laid
waste
by
sword
nor
pestilence
but
meets
the
one
with
pike
and
arbalest
touching
his
cap
to
the
sergeant
and
denys
alternately
and
with
policy
long
live
the
duke
the
pikemen
of
course
were
not
to
be
outdone
in
loyalty
so
they
shouted
with
stentorian
lungs
long
live
the
duke
then
the
decanted
ones
partly
because
loyalty
was
a
sentiment
in
those
days
partly
perhaps
because
they
feared
some
further
ill
consequence
should
they
alone
be
mute
raised
a
feeble
tremulous
shout
long
live
the
duke
but
at
this
insulted
nature
rebelled
perhaps
indeed
the
sham
sentiment
drew
out
the
real
for
on
the
very
heels
of
that
royal
noise
a
loud
and
piercing
wail
burst
from
every
woman
bosom
and
a
deep
deep
groan
from
every
man
oh
the
air
filled
in
a
moment
with
womanly
and
manly
anguish
judge
what
it
must
have
been
when
the
rude
pikemen
halted
unbidden
all
confused
as
if
a
wall
of
sorrow
had
started
up
before
them
en
avant
roared
the
sergeant
and
they
marched
again
but
muttering
and
cursing
ah
the
ugly
sound
said
the
civilian
wincing
les
malheureux
cried
he
ruefully
for
where
is
the
single
man
can
hear
the
sudden
agony
of
a
multitude
and
not
be
moved
les
ingrats
they
are
going
whence
they
were
de
trop
to
where
they
will
be
welcome
from
starvation
to
plenty
and
they
object
they
even
make
dismal
noises
one
would
think
we
were
thrusting
them
forth
from
come
away
whispered
gerard
trembling
come
away
and
the
friends
strode
forward
when
they
passed
the
head
of
the
column
and
saw
the
men
walk
with
their
eyes
bent
in
bitter
gloom
upon
the
ground
and
the
women
some
carrying
some
leading
little
children
and
weeping
as
they
went
and
the
poor
bairns
some
frolicking
some
weeping
because
their
mammies
wept
gerard
tried
hard
to
say
a
word
of
comfort
but
choked
and
could
utter
nothing
to
the
mourners
but
gasped
come
on
denys
i
can
not
mock
such
sorrow
with
little
words
of
and
now
all
his
aim
was
to
get
swiftly
out
of
the
grief
he
could
not
soothe
he
almost
ran
not
to
hear
these
sighs
and
sobs
why
mate
said
denys
art
the
colour
of
a
lemon
man
alive
take
not
other
folk
troubles
to
heart
not
one
of
those
whining
milksops
there
but
would
see
thee
a
stranger
hanged
without
gerard
scarce
listened
to
him
decant
them
he
groaned
ay
if
blood
were
no
thicker
than
wine
princes
ye
are
wolves
poor
things
poor
things
ah
denys
denys
with
looking
on
their
grief
mine
own
comes
home
to
me
ah
ay
now
you
talk
reason
that
you
poor
lad
should
be
driven
all
the
way
from
holland
to
rome
is
pitiful
indeed
but
these
snivelling
curs
where
is
their
hurt
there
is
six
score
of
to
keep
one
another
company
besides
they
are
not
going
out
of
better
for
them
if
they
had
never
been
in
mechant
va
they
are
but
going
from
one
village
to
another
a
journey
whilst
thou
there
no
more
courage
camarade
le
diable
est
gerard
shook
his
head
very
doubtfully
but
kept
silence
for
about
a
mile
and
then
he
said
thoughtfully
ay
denys
but
then
i
am
sustained
by
booklearning
these
are
simple
folk
that
likely
thought
their
village
was
the
world
now
what
is
this
more
weeping
oh
is
a
sweet
world
humph
a
little
girl
that
hath
broke
her
pipkin
now
may
i
hang
on
one
of
your
gibbets
but
i
dry
somebody
tears
and
he
pounced
savagely
upon
this
little
martyr
like
a
kite
on
a
chick
but
with
more
generous
intentions
it
was
a
pretty
little
lass
of
about
twelve
the
tears
were
raining
down
her
two
peaches
and
her
palms
lifted
to
heaven
in
that
utter
though
temporary
desolation
which
attends
calamity
at
twelve
and
at
her
feet
the
fatal
cause
a
broken
pot
worth
say
the
fifth
of
a
modern
farthing
what
hast
broken
thy
pot
little
one
said
gerard
acting
intensest
sympathy
helas
bel
gars
as
you
behold
and
the
hands
came
down
from
the
sky
and
both
pointed
at
the
fragments
a
statuette
of
adversity
and
you
weep
so
for
that
needs
i
must
bel
gars
my
mammy
will
massacre
me
do
they
not
already
with
a
fresh
burst
of
woe
me
tout
it
wanted
but
this
that
i
should
break
my
poor
pot
helas
donc
mere
de
dieu
courage
little
love
said
gerard
is
not
thy
heart
lies
broken
money
will
soon
mend
pots
see
now
here
is
a
piece
of
silver
and
there
scarce
a
stone
throw
off
is
a
potter
take
the
bit
of
silver
to
him
and
buy
another
pot
and
the
copper
the
potter
will
give
thee
keep
that
to
play
with
thy
the
little
mind
took
in
all
this
and
smiles
began
to
struggle
with
the
tears
but
spasms
are
like
waves
they
can
not
go
down
the
very
moment
the
wind
of
trouble
is
lulled
so
denys
thought
well
to
bring
up
his
reserve
of
consolation
courage
ma
mie
le
diable
est
mort
cried
that
inventive
warrior
gaily
gerard
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
such
a
way
of
cheering
a
little
girl
what
a
fine
thing
is
a
lute
with
one
string
said
he
the
little
girl
face
broke
into
warm
sunshine
oh
the
good
news
oh
the
good
news
she
sang
out
with
such
heartfelt
joy
it
went
off
into
a
honeyed
whine
even
as
our
gay
old
tunes
have
a
pathos
underneath
so
then
said
she
they
will
no
longer
be
able
to
threaten
us
little
girls
with
him
making
our
lives
a
burden
and
she
bounded
off
to
tell
nanette
she
said
there
is
a
theory
that
everything
has
its
counterpart
if
true
denys
it
would
seem
had
found
the
mind
his
consigne
fitted
while
he
was
roaring
with
laughter
at
its
unexpected
success
and
gerard
amazement
a
little
hand
pulled
his
jerkin
and
a
little
face
peeped
round
his
waist
curiosity
was
now
the
dominant
passion
in
that
small
but
vivid
countenance
toi
qui
tue
beau
soldat
oui
ma
mie
said
denys
as
gruffly
as
ever
he
could
rightly
deeming
this
would
smack
of
supernatural
puissance
to
owners
of
trebles
moi

adieu

said
gerard
and
on
they
marched
but
presently
looking
back
they
saw
the
contemner
of
women
in
the
middle
of
the
road
making
them
a
reverence
and
blowing
them
kisses
with
little
may
morning
face
come
on
cried
gerard
lustily
i
shall
win
to
rome
yet
holy
bavon
what
a
sunbeam
of
innocence
hath
shot
across
our
bloodthirsty
road
forget
thee
little
jeanneton
not
likely
amidst
all
this
slobbering
and
gibbeting
and
decanting
come
on
thou
laggard
forward
dost
call
this
marching
remonstrated
denys
why
we
shall
walk
christmas
day
and
never
see
at
the
next
town
they
came
to
suddenly
an
arbalestrier
ran
out
of
a
tavern
after
them
and
in
a
moment
his
beard
and
denys
were
like
two
brushes
stuck
together
it
was
a
comrade
he
insisted
on
their
coming
into
the
tavern
with
him
and
breaking
a
bottle
of
wine
in
course
of
conversation
he
told
denys
there
was
an
insurrection
in
the
flemish
provinces
and
soldiers
were
ordered
thither
from
all
parts
of
burgundy
indeed
i
marvelled
to
see
thy
face
turned
this
way
i
go
to
embrace
my
folk
that
i
have
not
seen
these
three
years
ye
can
quell
a
bit
of
a
rising
without
me
i
suddenly
denys
gave
a
start
dost
hear
gerard
this
comrade
is
bound
for
what
then
ah
a
letter
a
letter
to
margaret
but
will
he
be
so
good
so
kind
the
soldier
with
a
torrent
of
blasphemy
informed
him
he
would
not
only
take
it
but
go
a
league
or
two
out
of
his
way
to
do
it
in
an
instant
out
came
inkhorn
and
paper
from
gerard
wallet
and
he
wrote
a
long
letter
to
margaret
and
told
her
briefly
what
i
fear
i
have
spun
too
tediously
dwelt
most
on
the
bear
and
the
plunge
in
the
rhine
and
the
character
of
denys
whom
he
painted
to
the
life
and
with
many
endearing
expressions
bade
her
to
be
of
good
cheer
some
trouble
and
peril
there
had
been
but
all
that
was
over
now
and
his
only
grief
left
was
that
he
could
not
hope
to
have
a
word
from
her
hand
till
he
should
reach
rome
he
ended
with
comforting
her
again
as
hard
as
he
could
and
so
absorbed
was
he
in
his
love
and
his
work
that
he
did
not
see
all
the
people
in
the
room
were
standing
peeping
to
watch
the
nimble
and
true
finger
execute
such
rare
penmanship
denys
proud
of
his
friend
skill
let
him
alone
till
presently
the
writer
face
worked
and
soon
the
scalding
tears
began
to
run
down
his
young
cheeks
one
after
another
on
the
paper
where
he
was
then
writing
comfort
comfort
then
denys
rudely
repulsed
the
curious
and
asked
his
comrade
with
a
faltering
voice
whether
he
had
the
heart
to
let
so
sweet
a
miscarry
the
other
swore
by
the
face
of
luke
he
would
lose
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
sooner
seeing
him
so
ready
gerard
charged
him
also
with
a
short
cold
letter
to
his
parents
and
in
it
he
drew
hastily
with
his
pen
two
hands
grasping
each
other
to
signify
farewell
one
drop
of
bitterness
found
its
way
into
his
letter
to
margaret
but
of
that
anon
gerard
now
offered
money
to
the
soldier
he
hesitated
but
declined
it
no
no
art
comrade
of
my
comrade
and
may
etc
but
thy
love
for
the
wench
touches
me
i
break
another
bottle
at
thy
charge
an
thou
wilt
and
so
cry
well
said
comrade
cried
denys
hadst
taken
money
i
had
invited
thee
to
walk
in
the
courtyard
and
cross
swords
with
whereupon
i
had
cut
thy
comb
for
thee
retorted
the
other
hadst
done
thy
endeavour
drole
i
doubt
they
drank
the
new
bottle
shook
hands
adhered
to
custom
and
parted
on
opposite
routes
this
delay
however
somewhat
put
out
denys
calculations
and
evening
surprised
them
ere
they
reached
a
little
town
he
was
making
for
where
was
a
famous
hotel
however
they
fell
in
with
a
roadside
auberge
and
denys
seeing
a
buxom
girl
at
the
door
said
this
seems
a
decent
inn
and
led
the
way
into
the
kitchen
they
ordered
supper
to
which
no
objection
was
raised
only
the
landlord
requested
them
to
pay
for
it
beforehand
it
was
not
an
uncommon
proposal
in
any
part
of
the
world
still
it
was
not
universal
and
denys
was
nettled
and
dashed
his
hand
somewhat
ostentatiously
into
his
purse
and
pulled
out
a
gold
angel
count
me
the
change
and
speedily
said
he
you
are
more
likely
to
rob
me
than
i
while
the
supper
was
preparing
denys
disappeared
and
was
eventually
found
by
gerard
in
the
yard
helping
manon
his
plump
but
not
bright
decoy
duck
to
draw
water
and
pouring
extravagant
compliments
into
her
dullish
ear
gerard
grunted
and
returned
to
table
but
denys
did
not
come
in
for
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
uphill
work
at
the
end
of
a
march
said
he
shrugging
his
shoulders
what
matters
that
to
you
said
gerard
drily
the
mad
dog
bites
all
the
exaggerator
you
know
i
bite
but
the
fairer
half
well
here
comes
supper
that
is
better
worth
during
supper
the
girl
kept
constantly
coming
in
and
out
and
looking
at
them
especially
at
denys
and
at
last
in
leaning
over
him
to
remove
a
dish
dropped
a
word
in
his
ear
and
he
replied
with
a
nod
as
soon
as
supper
was
cleared
away
denys
rose
and
strolled
to
the
door
telling
gerard
the
sullen
fair
had
relented
and
given
him
a
little
rendezvous
in
the
gerard
suggested
that
the
would
have
been
a
more
appropriate
locality
i
shall
go
to
bed
then
said
he
a
little
crossly
where
is
the
landlord
out
at
this
time
of
night
no
matter
i
know
our
room
shall
you
be
long
pray
not
i
grudge
leaving
the
fire
and
thee
but
what
can
i
do
there
are
two
sorts
of
invitations
a
burgundian
never
denys
found
a
figure
seated
by
the
well
it
was
manon
but
instead
of
receiving
him
as
he
thought
he
had
a
right
to
expect
coming
by
invitation
all
she
did
was
to
sob
he
asked
her
what
ailed
her
she
sobbed
could
he
do
anything
for
her
she
sobbed
the
denys
driven
to
his
wits
end
which
was
no
great
distance
proffered
the
custom
of
the
country
by
way
of
consolation
she
repulsed
him
roughly
is
it
a
time
for
fooling
said
she
and
sobbed
you
seem
to
think
so
said
denys
waxing
wroth
but
the
next
moment
he
added
tenderly
and
i
who
could
never
bear
to
see
beauty
in
it
is
not
for
who
then
your
sweetheart
oh
que
nenni
my
sweetheart
is
not
on
earth
now
and
to
think
i
have
not
an
ecu
to
buy
masses
for
his
soul
and
in
this
shallow
nature
the
grief
seemed
now
to
be
all
turned
in
another
direction
come
come
said
denys
shalt
have
money
to
buy
masses
for
thy
dead
lad
i
swear
it
meantime
tell
me
why
you
for
for
me
art
mad
no
i
am
not
mad
is
you
that
were
mad
to
open
your
purse
before
the
mystery
seemed
to
thicken
and
denys
wearied
of
stirring
up
the
mud
by
questions
held
his
peace
to
see
if
it
would
not
clear
of
itself
then
the
girl
finding
herself
no
longer
questioned
seemed
to
go
through
some
internal
combat
at
last
she
said
doggedly
and
aloud
i
will
the
virgin
give
me
courage
what
matters
it
if
they
kill
me
since
he
is
dead
soldier
the
landlord
is
oh
is
he
what
do
landlords
leave
their
taverns
at
this
time
of
night
also
see
what
a
tempest
we
are
sheltered
here
but
side
it
blows
a
denys
said
nothing
he
is
gone
to
fetch
the
the
band
what
band
those
who
will
cut
your
throat
and
take
your
gold
wretched
man
to
go
and
shake
gold
in
an
innkeeper
face
the
blow
came
so
unexpectedly
it
staggered
even
denys
accustomed
as
he
was
to
sudden
perils
he
muttered
a
single
word
but
in
it
a
volume
gerard
gerard
what
is
that
oh
is
thy
comrade
name
poor
lad
get
him
out
quick
ere
they
come
and
fly
to
the
next
and
thou
they
will
kill
that
shall
they
not
fly
with
avail
me
nought
one
of
the
band
will
be
sent
to
kill
me
they
are
sworn
to
slay
all
who
betray
i
take
thee
to
my
native
place
full
thirty
leagues
from
hence
and
put
thee
under
my
own
mother
wing
ere
they
shall
hurt
a
hair
o
thy
head
but
first
gerard
stay
thou
here
whilst
i
fetch
him
as
he
was
darting
off
the
girl
seized
him
convulsively
and
with
all
the
iron
strength
excitement
lends
to
women
stay
me
not
for
sake
he
cried
is
life
or
sh
sh
whispered
the
girl
shutting
his
mouth
hard
with
her
hand
and
putting
her
pale
lips
close
to
him
and
her
eyes
that
seemed
to
turn
backwards
straining
towards
some
indistinct
sound
he
listened
he
heard
footsteps
many
footsteps
and
no
voices
she
whispered
in
his
ear
they
are
and
trembled
like
a
leaf
denys
felt
it
was
so
travellers
in
that
number
would
never
have
come
in
dead
silence
the
feet
were
now
at
the
very
door
how
many
said
he
in
a
hollow
whisper
hush
and
she
put
her
mouth
to
his
very
ear
and
who
that
had
seen
this
man
and
woman
in
that
attitude
would
have
guessed
what
freezing
hearts
were
theirs
and
what
terrible
whispers
passed
between
them
how
armed
sword
and
dagger
and
the
giant
with
his
axe
they
call
him
the
and
my
comrade
nothing
can
save
him
better
lose
one
life
than
two
fly
denys
blood
froze
at
this
cynical
advice
poor
creature
you
know
not
a
soldier
he
put
his
head
in
his
hands
a
moment
and
a
hundred
thoughts
of
dangers
baffled
whirled
through
his
brain
listen
girl
there
is
one
chance
for
our
lives
if
thou
wilt
but
be
true
to
us
run
to
the
town
to
the
nearest
tavern
and
tell
the
first
soldier
there
that
a
soldier
here
is
sore
beset
but
armed
and
his
life
to
be
saved
if
they
will
but
run
then
to
the
bailiff
but
first
to
the
soldiers
nay
not
a
word
but
buss
me
good
lass
and
fly
lives
hang
on
thy
she
kilted
up
her
gown
to
run
he
came
round
to
the
road
with
her
saw
her
cross
the
road
cringing
with
fear
then
glide
away
then
turn
into
an
erect
shadow
then
melt
away
in
the
storm
and
now
he
must
get
to
gerard
but
how
he
had
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
whole
band
he
asked
himself
what
was
the
worst
thing
they
could
do
for
he
had
learned
in
war
that
an
enemy
does
not
what
you
hope
he
will
do
but
what
you
hope
he
will
not
do
attack
me
as
i
enter
the
kitchen
then
i
must
not
give
them
just
as
he
drew
near
to
the
latch
a
terrible
thought
crossed
him
suppose
they
had
already
dealt
with
gerard
why
then
thought
he
nought
is
left
but
to
kill
and
be
killed
and
he
strung
his
bow
and
walked
rapidly
into
the
kitchen
there
were
seven
hideous
faces
seated
round
the
fire
and
the
landlord
pouring
them
out
neat
brandy
forerunner
in
every
age
what
company
cried
denys
gaily
one
minute
my
lads
and
i
be
with
you
and
he
snatched
up
a
lighted
candle
off
the
table
opened
the
door
that
led
to
the
staircase
and
went
up
it
hallooing
what
gerard
whither
hast
thou
skulked
to
there
was
no
answer
he
hallooed
louder
gerard
where
art
thou
after
a
moment
in
which
denys
lived
an
hour
of
agony
a
peevish
noise
issued
from
the
room
at
the
head
of
the
little
stairs
denys
burst
in
and
there
was
gerard
asleep
thank
god
he
said
in
a
choking
voice
then
began
to
sing
loud
untuneful
ditties
gerard
put
his
fingers
into
his
ears
but
presently
he
saw
in
denys
face
a
horror
that
contrasted
strangely
with
this
sudden
merriment
what
ails
thee
said
he
sitting
up
and
staring
hush
said
denys
and
his
hand
spoke
even
more
plainly
than
his
lips
listen
to
denys
then
pointing
significantly
to
the
door
to
show
gerard
sharp
ears
were
listening
hard
by
continued
his
song
aloud
but
under
cover
of
it
threw
in
short
muttered
syllables
our
lives
are
in
peril
thieves
thy
doublet
thy
sword
aid
coming
put
off
then
aloud
well
now
wilt
have
bottle
say
no
not
but
i
tell
thee
there
are
jolly
fellows
ay
but
i
am
too
wearied
said
gerard
go
nay
nay
then
he
went
to
the
door
and
called
out
cheerfully
landlord
the
young
milksop
will
not
rise
give
those
honest
fellows
bottle
i
will
pay
in
the
he
heard
a
brutal
and
fierce
chuckle
having
thus
by
observation
made
sure
the
kitchen
door
was
shut
and
the
miscreants
were
not
actually
listening
he
examined
the
chamber
door
closely
then
quietly
shut
it
but
did
not
bolt
it
and
went
and
inspected
the
window
it
was
too
small
to
get
out
of
and
yet
a
thick
bar
of
iron
had
been
let
in
the
stone
to
make
it
smaller
and
just
as
he
made
this
chilling
discovery
the
outer
door
of
the
house
was
bolted
with
a
loud
clang
denys
groaned
the
beasts
are
in
the
but
would
the
thieves
attack
them
while
they
were
awake
probably
not
not
to
throw
away
this
their
best
chance
the
poor
souls
now
made
a
series
of
desperate
efforts
to
converse
as
if
discussing
ordinary
matters
and
by
this
means
gerard
learned
all
that
had
passed
and
that
the
girl
was
gone
for
aid
pray
heaven
she
may
not
lose
heart
by
the
way
said
denys
sorrowfully
and
denys
begged
gerard
forgiveness
for
bringing
him
out
of
his
way
for
this
gerard
forgave
him
i
would
fear
them
less
gerard
but
for
one
they
call
the
abbot
i
picked
him
out
at
once
taller
than
you
bigger
than
us
both
put
together
fights
with
an
axe
gerard
a
man
to
lead
a
herd
of
deer
to
battle
i
shall
kill
that
man
or
he
will
kill
me
i
think
somehow
is
he
will
kill
saints
forbid
shoot
him
at
the
door
what
avails
his
strength
against
your
weapon
i
shall
pick
him
out
but
if
it
comes
to
hand
fighting
run
swiftly
under
his
guard
or
you
are
a
dead
man
i
tell
thee
neither
of
us
may
stand
a
blow
of
that
axe
thou
never
sawest
such
a
body
of
a
gerard
was
for
bolting
the
door
but
denys
with
a
sign
showed
him
that
half
the
turned
outward
on
a
hinge
and
the
great
bolt
was
little
more
than
a
blind
i
have
forborne
to
bolt
it
said
he
that
they
may
think
us
the
less
near
an
hour
rolled
away
thus
it
seemed
an
age
yet
it
was
but
a
little
hour
and
the
town
was
a
league
distant
and
some
of
the
voices
in
the
kitchen
became
angry
and
impatient
they
will
not
wait
much
longer
said
denys
and
we
have
no
chance
at
all
unless
we
surprise
i
will
do
you
bid
said
gerard
meekly
there
was
a
cupboard
on
the
same
side
as
the
door
but
between
it
and
the
window
it
reached
nearly
to
the
ground
but
not
quite
denys
opened
the
cupboard
door
and
placed
gerard
on
a
chair
behind
it
if
they
run
for
the
bed
strike
at
the
napes
of
their
necks
a
sword
cut
there
always
kills
or
he
then
arranged
the
bolsters
and
their
shoes
in
the
bed
so
as
to
deceive
a
person
peeping
from
a
distance
and
drew
the
short
curtains
at
the
head
meantime
gerard
was
on
his
knees
denys
looked
round
and
saw
him
ah
said
denys
above
all
pray
them
to
forgive
me
for
bringing
you
into
this
and
now
they
grasped
hands
and
looked
in
one
another
eyes
oh
such
a
look
denys
hand
was
cold
and
gerard
warm
they
took
their
posts
denys
blew
out
the
candle
we
must
keep
silence
but
in
the
terrible
tension
of
their
nerves
and
very
souls
they
found
they
could
hear
a
whisper
fainter
than
any
man
could
catch
at
all
outside
that
door
they
could
hear
each
other
hearts
thump
at
times
good
news
breathed
denys
listening
at
the
door
they
are
casting
pray
that
it
may
be
the
yes
why
if
he
comes
alone
i
can
make
sure
of
denys
ay
i
fear
i
shall
go
mad
if
they
do
not
come
shall
i
feign
sleep
shall
i
snore
will
that
perhaps
do
then
and
god
have
mercy
on
us
denys
snored
at
intervals
there
was
a
scuffling
of
feet
heard
in
the
kitchen
and
then
all
was
still
denys
snored
again
then
took
up
his
position
behind
the
door
but
he
or
they
who
had
drawn
the
lot
seemed
determined
to
run
no
foolish
risks
nothing
was
attempted
in
a
hurry
when
they
were
almost
starved
with
cold
and
waiting
for
the
attack
the
door
on
the
stairs
opened
softly
and
closed
again
nothing
more
there
was
another
harrowing
silence
then
a
single
light
footstep
on
the
stair
and
nothing
more
then
a
light
crept
under
the
door
and
nothing
more
presently
there
was
a
gentle
scratching
not
half
so
loud
as
a
mouse
and
the
false
opened
by
degrees
and
left
a
perpendicular
space
through
which
the
light
streamed
in
the
door
had
it
been
bolted
would
now
have
hung
by
the
bare
tip
of
the
bolt
which
went
into
the
real
but
as
it
was
it
swung
gently
open
of
itself
it
opened
inwards
so
denys
did
not
raise
his
crossbow
from
the
ground
but
merely
grasped
his
dagger
the
candle
was
held
up
and
shaded
from
behind
by
a
man
hand
he
was
inspecting
the
beds
from
the
threshold
satisfied
that
his
victims
were
both
in
bed
the
man
glided
into
the
apartment
but
at
the
first
step
something
in
the
position
of
the
cupboard
and
chair
made
him
uneasy
he
ventured
no
further
but
put
the
candle
on
the
floor
and
stooped
to
peer
under
the
chair
but
as
he
stooped
an
iron
hand
grasped
his
shoulder
and
a
dagger
was
driven
so
fiercely
through
his
neck
that
the
point
came
out
at
his
gullet
there
was
a
terrible
hiccough
but
no
cry
and
silent
strokes
followed
in
swift
succession
each
a
and
the
assassin
was
laid
noiselessly
on
the
floor
denys
closed
the
door
bolted
it
gently
drew
the
post
to
and
even
while
he
was
going
whispered
gerard
to
bring
a
chair
it
was
done
help
me
set
him
dead
what
for
frighten
them
gain
even
while
saying
this
denys
had
whipped
a
piece
of
string
round
the
dead
man
neck
and
tied
him
to
the
chair
and
there
the
ghastly
figure
sat
fronting
the
door
denys
i
can
do
better
saints
forgive
me
what
be
quick
then
we
have
not
many
and
denys
got
his
crossbow
ready
and
tearing
off
his
straw
mattress
reared
it
before
him
and
prepared
to
shoot
the
moment
the
door
should
open
for
he
had
no
hope
any
more
would
come
singly
when
they
found
the
first
did
not
return
while
thus
employed
gerard
was
busy
about
the
seated
corpse
and
to
his
amazement
denys
saw
a
luminous
glow
spreading
rapidly
over
the
white
face
gerard
blew
out
the
candle
and
on
this
the
corpse
face
shone
still
more
like
a
glowworm
head
denys
shook
in
his
shoes
and
his
teeth
chattered
what
in
heaven
name
is
this
he
whispered
hush
is
but
phosphorus
but
away
they
will
surprise
in
fact
uneasy
mutterings
were
heard
below
and
at
last
a
deep
voice
said
what
makes
him
so
long
is
the
drole
rifling
them
it
was
their
comrade
they
suspected
then
not
the
enemy
soon
a
step
came
softly
but
rapidly
up
the
stairs
the
door
was
gently
tried
when
this
resisted
which
was
clearly
not
expected
the
sham
post
was
very
cautiously
moved
and
an
eye
no
doubt
peeped
through
the
aperture
for
there
was
a
howl
of
dismay
and
the
man
was
heard
to
stumble
back
and
burst
into
the
kitchen
here
a
babel
of
voices
rose
directly
on
his
return
gerard
ran
to
the
dead
thief
and
began
to
work
on
him
again
back
madman
whispered
denys
nay
nay
i
know
these
ignorant
brutes
they
will
not
venture
here
awhile
i
can
make
him
ten
times
more
at
least
close
that
opening
let
them
not
see
you
at
your
devilish
gerard
closed
the
sham
post
and
in
half
a
minute
his
brush
gave
the
dead
head
a
sight
to
strike
any
man
with
dismay
he
put
his
art
to
a
strange
use
and
one
unparalleled
perhaps
in
the
history
of
mankind
he
illuminated
his
dead
enemy
face
to
frighten
his
living
foe
the
staring
eyeballs
he
made
globes
of
fire
the
teeth
he
left
white
for
so
they
were
more
terrible
by
the
contrast
but
the
palate
and
tongue
he
tipped
with
fire
and
made
one
lurid
cavern
of
the
red
depths
the
chapfallen
jaw
revealed
and
on
the
brow
he
wrote
in
burning
letters
la
and
while
he
was
doing
it
the
stout
denys
was
quaking
and
fearing
the
vengeance
of
heaven
for
one
mans
courage
is
not
another
and
the
band
of
miscreants
below
were
quarrelling
and
disputing
loudly
and
now
without
disguise
the
steps
that
led
down
to
the
kitchen
were
fifteen
but
they
were
nearly
perpendicular
there
was
therefore
in
point
of
fact
no
distance
between
the
besiegers
and
besieged
and
the
latter
now
caught
almost
every
word
at
last
one
was
heard
to
cry
out
i
tell
ye
the
devil
has
got
him
and
branded
him
with
hellfire
i
am
more
like
to
leave
this
cursed
house
than
go
again
into
a
room
that
is
full
of
art
drunk
or
mad
or
a
coward
said
another
call
me
a
coward
i
give
thee
my
dagger
point
and
send
thee
where
pierre
sits
o
fire
for
ever
come
no
quarrelling
when
work
is
afoot
roared
a
tremendous
diapason
or
i
brain
ye
both
with
my
fist
and
send
ye
where
we
shall
all
go
soon
or
the
abbot
whispered
denys
gravely
he
felt
the
voice
he
had
just
heard
could
belong
to
no
man
but
the
colossus
he
had
seen
in
passing
through
the
kitchen
it
made
the
place
vibrate
the
quarrelling
continued
some
time
and
then
there
was
a
dead
silence
look
out
ay
what
will
they
do
next
we
shall
soon
shall
i
wait
for
you
or
cut
down
the
first
that
opens
the
door
wait
for
me
lest
we
strike
the
same
and
waste
a
blow
alas
we
can
not
afford
dead
silence
sudden
came
into
the
room
a
thing
that
made
them
start
and
their
hearts
quiver
and
what
was
it
a
moonbeam
even
so
can
this
machine
the
body
by
the
soul
action
be
strung
up
to
start
and
quiver
the
sudden
ray
shot
keen
and
pure
into
that
shamble
its
calm
cold
silvery
soul
traversed
the
apartment
in
a
stream
of
no
great
volume
for
the
window
was
narrow
after
the
first
tremor
gerard
whispered
courage
denys
god
eye
is
on
us
even
and
he
fell
upon
his
knees
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
window
ay
it
was
like
a
holy
eye
opening
suddenly
on
human
crime
and
human
passions
many
a
scene
of
blood
and
crime
that
pure
cold
eye
had
rested
on
but
on
few
more
ghastly
than
this
where
two
men
with
a
lighted
corpse
between
them
waited
panting
to
kill
and
be
killed
nor
did
the
moonlight
deaden
that
horrible
if
anything
it
added
to
its
ghastliness
for
the
body
sat
at
the
edge
of
the
moonbeam
which
cut
sharp
across
the
shoulder
and
the
ear
and
seemed
blue
and
ghastly
and
unnatural
by
the
side
of
that
lurid
glow
in
which
the
face
and
eyes
and
teeth
shone
horribly
but
denys
dared
not
look
that
way
the
moon
drew
a
broad
stripe
of
light
across
the
door
and
on
that
his
eyes
were
glued
presently
he
whispered
gerard
gerard
looked
and
raised
his
sword
acutely
as
they
had
listened
they
had
heard
of
late
no
sound
on
the
stair
yet
therein
the
at
the
edge
of
the
stream
of
moonlight
were
the
tips
of
the
fingers
of
a
hand
the
nails
glistened
presently
they
began
to
crawl
and
crawl
down
towards
the
bolt
but
with
infinite
slowness
and
caution
in
so
doing
they
crept
into
the
moonlight
the
actual
motion
was
imperceptible
but
slowly
slowly
the
fingers
came
out
whiter
and
whiter
but
the
hand
between
the
main
knuckles
and
the
wrist
remained
dark
denys
slowly
raised
his
crossbow
he
levelled
it
he
took
a
long
steady
aim
gerard
palpitated
at
last
the
crossbow
twanged
the
hand
was
instantly
nailed
with
a
stern
jar
to
the
quivering
there
was
a
scream
of
anguish
cut
whispered
denys
eagerly
and
gerard
uplifted
sword
descended
and
severed
the
wrist
with
two
swift
blows
a
body
sank
down
moaning
outside
the
hand
remained
inside
immovable
with
blood
trickling
from
it
down
the
wall
the
fierce
bolt
slightly
barbed
had
gone
through
it
and
deep
into
the
real
two
said
denys
with
terrible
cynicism
he
strung
his
crossbow
and
kneeled
behind
his
cover
again
the
next
will
be
the
the
wounded
man
moved
and
presently
crawled
down
to
his
companions
on
the
stairs
and
the
kitchen
door
was
shut
there
nothing
was
heard
now
but
low
muttering
the
last
incident
had
revealed
the
mortal
character
of
the
weapons
used
by
the
besieged
i
begin
to
think
the
abbot
stomach
is
not
so
great
as
his
body
said
denys
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
when
the
following
events
happened
all
in
a
couple
of
seconds
the
kitchen
door
was
opened
roughly
a
heavy
but
active
man
darted
up
the
stairs
without
any
manner
of
disguise
and
a
single
ponderous
blow
sent
the
door
not
only
off
its
hinges
but
right
across
the
room
on
to
denys
fortification
which
it
struck
so
rudely
as
nearly
to
lay
him
flat
and
in
the
doorway
stood
a
colossus
with
a
glittering
axe
he
saw
the
dead
man
with
the
moon
blue
light
on
half
his
face
and
the
red
light
on
the
other
half
and
inside
his
chapfallen
jaws
he
stared
his
arms
fell
his
knees
knocked
together
and
he
crouched
with
terror
la
mort
he
cried
in
tones
of
terror
and
turned
and
fled
in
which
act
denys
started
up
and
shot
him
through
both
jaws
he
sprang
with
one
bound
into
the
kitchen
and
there
leaned
on
his
axe
spitting
blood
and
teeth
and
curses
denys
strung
his
bow
and
put
his
hand
into
his
breast
he
drew
it
out
dismayed
my
last
bolt
is
gone
he
groaned
but
we
have
our
swords
and
you
have
slain
the
no
gerard
said
denys
gravely
i
have
not
and
the
worst
is
i
have
wounded
him
fool
to
shoot
at
a
retreating
lion
he
had
never
faced
thy
handiwork
again
but
for
my
ha
to
your
guard
i
hear
them
open
the
then
denys
depressed
by
the
one
error
he
had
committed
in
all
this
fearful
night
felt
convinced
his
last
hour
had
come
he
drew
his
sword
but
like
one
doomed
but
what
is
this
a
red
light
flickers
on
the
ceiling
gerard
flew
to
the
window
and
looked
out
there
were
men
with
torches
and
breastplates
gleaming
red
we
are
saved
armed
men
and
he
dashed
his
sword
through
the
window
shouting
quick
quick
we
are
sore
back
yelled
denys
they
come
strike
none
but
him
that
very
moment
the
abbot
and
two
men
with
naked
weapons
rushed
into
the
room
even
as
they
came
the
outer
door
was
hammered
fiercely
and
the
abbot
comrades
hearing
it
and
seeing
the
torchlight
turned
and
fled
not
so
the
terrible
abbot
wild
with
rage
and
pain
he
spurned
his
dead
comrade
chair
and
all
across
the
room
then
as
the
men
faced
him
on
each
side
with
kindling
eyeballs
he
waved
his
tremendous
axe
like
a
feather
right
and
left
and
cleared
a
space
then
lifted
it
to
hew
them
both
in
pieces
his
antagonists
were
inferior
in
strength
but
not
in
swiftness
and
daring
and
above
all
they
had
settled
how
to
attack
him
the
moment
he
reared
his
axe
they
flew
at
him
like
cats
and
both
together
if
he
struck
a
full
blow
with
his
weapon
he
would
most
likely
kill
one
but
the
other
would
certainly
kill
him
he
saw
this
and
intelligent
as
well
as
powerful
he
thrust
the
handle
fiercely
in
denys
face
and
turning
jobbed
with
the
steel
at
gerard
denys
went
staggering
back
covered
with
blood
gerard
had
rushed
in
like
lightning
and
just
as
the
axe
turned
to
descend
on
him
drove
his
sword
so
fiercely
through
the
giant
body
that
the
very
hilt
sounded
on
his
ribs
like
the
blow
of
a
pugilist
and
denys
staggering
back
to
help
his
friend
saw
a
steel
point
come
out
of
the
abbot
behind
the
stricken
giant
bellowed
like
a
bull
dropped
his
axe
and
clutching
gerard
throat
tremendously
shook
him
like
a
child
then
denys
with
a
fierce
snarl
drove
his
sword
into
the
giant
back
stand
firm
now
and
he
pushed
the
cold
steel
through
and
through
the
giant
and
out
at
his
breast
thus
horribly
spitted
on
both
sides
the
abbot
gave
a
violent
shudder
and
his
heels
hammered
the
ground
convulsively
his
lips
fast
turning
blue
opened
wide
and
deep
and
he
cried
la
mort
mort
mort
the
first
time
in
a
roar
of
despair
and
then
twice
in
a
whisper
never
to
be
forgotten
just
then
the
street
door
was
forced
suddenly
the
abbot
arms
whirled
like
windmills
and
his
huge
body
wrenched
wildly
and
carried
them
to
the
doorway
twisting
their
wrists
and
nearly
throwing
them
off
their
legs
he
win
clear
yet
cried
denys
out
steel
and
in
again
they
tore
out
their
smoking
swords
but
ere
they
could
stab
again
the
abbot
leaped
full
five
feet
high
and
fell
with
a
tremendous
crash
against
the
door
below
carrying
it
away
with
him
like
a
sheet
of
paper
and
through
the
aperture
the
glare
of
torches
burst
on
the
faces
above
half
blinding
them
the
thieves
at
the
first
alarm
had
made
for
the
back
door
but
driven
thence
by
a
strong
guard
ran
back
to
the
kitchen
just
in
time
to
see
the
lock
forced
out
of
the
socket
and
mailed
archers
burst
in
upon
them
on
these
in
pure
despair
they
drew
their
swords
but
ere
a
blow
was
struck
on
either
side
the
staircase
door
behind
them
was
battered
into
their
midst
with
one
ponderous
blow
and
with
it
the
abbot
body
came
flying
hurled
as
they
thought
by
no
mortal
hand
and
rolled
on
the
floor
spouting
blood
from
back
and
bosom
in
two
furious
jets
and
quivered
but
breathed
no
more
the
thieves
smitten
with
dismay
fell
on
their
knees
directly
and
the
archers
bound
them
while
above
the
rescued
ones
still
stood
like
statues
rooted
to
the
spot
their
dripping
swords
extended
in
the
red
torchlight
expecting
their
indomitable
enemy
to
leap
back
on
them
as
wonderfully
as
he
had
gone
chapter
xxxiv
where
be
the
true
men
here
be
we
god
bless
you
all
god
bless
you
there
was
a
rush
to
the
stairs
and
hard
but
friendly
hands
were
held
out
and
grasped
them
warmly
saved
our
lives
lads
cried
denys
saved
our
lives
this
a
wild
sight
met
the
eyes
of
the
rescued
pair
the
room
flaring
with
torches
the
glittering
breastplates
of
the
archers
their
bronzed
faces
the
white
cheeks
of
the
bound
thieves
and
the
bleeding
giant
whose
dead
body
these
hard
men
left
lying
there
in
its
own
gore
gerard
went
round
the
archers
and
took
them
each
by
the
hand
with
glistening
eyes
and
on
this
they
all
kissed
him
and
this
time
he
kissed
them
in
return
then
he
said
to
one
handsome
archer
of
his
own
age
prithee
good
soldier
have
an
eye
to
me
a
strange
drowsiness
overcomes
me
let
no
one
cut
my
throat
while
i
sleep
for
pity
the
archer
promised
with
a
laugh
for
he
thought
gerard
was
jesting
and
the
latter
went
off
into
a
deep
sleep
almost
immediately
denys
was
surprised
at
this
but
did
not
interfere
for
it
suited
his
immediate
purpose
a
couple
of
archers
were
inspecting
the
abbot
body
turning
it
half
over
with
their
feet
and
inquiring
which
of
the
two
had
flung
this
enormous
rogue
down
from
an
upper
storey
like
that
they
would
fain
have
the
trick
of
his
denys
at
first
pished
and
pshawed
but
dared
not
play
the
braggart
for
he
said
to
himself
that
young
vagabond
will
break
in
and
say
was
the
finger
of
heaven
and
no
mortal
arm
or
some
such
stuff
and
make
me
look
like
a
but
now
seeing
gerard
unconscious
he
suddenly
gave
this
required
information
well
then
you
see
comrades
i
had
run
my
sword
through
this
one
up
to
the
hilt
and
one
or
two
more
of
came
buzzing
about
me
so
it
behoved
me
have
my
sword
or
die
so
i
just
put
my
foot
against
his
stomach
gave
a
tug
with
my
hand
and
a
spring
with
my
foot
and
sent
him
flying
to
kingdom
come
he
died
in
the
air
and
his
carrion
rolled
in
amongst
you
without
ceremony
made
you
jump
i
warrant
me
but
pikestaves
and
pillage
what
avails
prattling
of
these
trifles
once
they
are
gone
by
buvons
camarades
the
archers
remarked
that
it
was
easy
to
say
buvons
where
no
liquor
was
but
not
so
easy
to
do
it
nay
i
soon
find
you
liquor
my
nose
hath
a
natural
alacrity
at
scenting
out
the
wine
you
follow
me
and
i
my
nose
bring
a
torch
and
they
left
the
room
and
finding
a
short
flight
of
stone
steps
descended
them
and
entered
a
large
low
damp
cellar
it
smelt
close
and
dank
and
the
walls
were
encrusted
here
and
there
with
what
seemed
cobwebs
but
proved
to
be
saltpetre
that
had
oozed
out
of
the
damp
stones
and
crystallized
oh
the
fine
mouldy
smell
said
denys
in
such
places
still
lurks
the
good
wine
advance
thy
torch
diable
what
is
that
in
the
corner
a
pile
of
rags
no
is
a
they
gathered
round
with
the
torch
and
lo
a
figure
crouched
on
a
heap
in
the
corner
pale
as
ashes
and
shivering
why
it
is
the
landlord
said
denys
get
up
thou
craven
heart
shouted
one
of
the
archers
why
man
the
thieves
are
bound
and
we
are
dry
that
bound
them
up
and
show
us
thy
wine
for
no
bottles
see
what
be
the
rascals
bound
stammered
the
pale
landlord
good
news
that
will
i
honest
and
he
rose
with
unsure
joints
and
offered
to
lead
the
way
to
the
wine
cellar
but
denys
interposed
you
are
all
in
the
dark
comrades
he
is
in
league
with
the
alack
good
soldier
me
in
league
with
the
accursed
robbers
is
that
reasonable
the
girl
said
so
the
girl
what
girl
ah
curse
her
traitress
well
interposed
the
other
archer
the
girl
is
not
here
but
gone
on
to
the
bailiff
so
let
the
burghers
settle
whether
this
craven
be
guilty
or
no
for
we
caught
him
not
in
the
act
and
let
him
draw
us
our
one
moment
said
denys
shrewdly
why
cursed
he
the
girl
if
he
be
a
true
man
he
should
bless
her
as
we
alas
sir
said
the
landlord
i
have
but
my
good
name
to
live
by
and
i
cursed
her
to
you
because
you
said
she
had
belied
humph
i
trow
thou
art
a
thief
and
where
is
the
thief
that
can
not
lie
with
a
smooth
face
therefore
hold
him
comrades
a
prisoner
can
draw
wine
an
if
his
hands
be
not
the
landlord
offered
no
objection
but
on
the
contrary
said
he
would
with
pleasure
show
them
where
his
little
stock
of
wine
was
but
hoped
they
would
pay
for
what
they
should
drink
for
his
rent
was
due
this
two
months
the
archers
smiled
grimly
at
his
simplicity
as
they
thought
it
one
of
them
laid
a
hand
quietly
but
firmly
on
his
shoulder
the
other
led
on
with
the
torch
they
had
reached
the
threshold
when
denys
cried
halt
what
here
be
bottles
in
this
corner
advance
thy
the
went
towards
him
he
had
just
taken
off
his
scabbard
and
was
probing
the
heap
the
landlord
had
just
been
crouched
upon
nay
nay
cried
the
landlord
the
wine
is
in
the
next
cellar
there
is
nothing
nothing
is
mighty
hard
then
said
denys
and
drew
out
something
with
his
hand
from
the
heap
it
proved
to
be
only
a
bone
denys
threw
it
on
the
floor
it
rattled
there
is
nought
there
but
the
bones
of
the
house
said
the
landlord
just
now
was
nothing
now
that
we
have
found
something
is
nothing
but
bones
here
another
humph
look
at
this
one
comrade
and
you
come
too
and
look
at
it
and
bring
you
smooth
knave
the
archer
with
the
torch
whose
name
was
philippe
held
the
bone
to
the
light
and
turned
it
round
and
round
well
said
denys
well
if
this
was
a
field
of
battle
i
should
say
was
the
shankbone
of
a
man
no
more
no
less
but
is
a
battlefield
nor
a
churchyard
an
true
mate
but
yon
knave
ashy
face
is
as
good
a
light
to
me
as
a
field
of
battle
i
read
the
bone
by
it
bring
yon
face
nearer
i
say
when
the
chine
is
amissing
and
the
house
dog
ca
look
at
you
without
his
tail
creeping
between
his
legs
who
was
the
thief
good
brothers
mine
my
mind
it
doth
misgive
me
the
deeper
i
thrust
the
more
there
be
mayhap
if
these
bones
could
tell
their
tale
they
would
make
true
flesh
creep
that
heard
alas
young
man
what
hideous
fancies
are
these
the
bones
are
bones
of
beeves
and
sheep
and
kids
and
not
as
you
think
of
men
and
women
holy
saints
preserve
us
hold
thy
peace
thy
words
are
air
thou
hast
not
got
burghers
by
the
ear
that
know
not
a
veal
knuckle
from
their
grandsire
ribs
but
that
have
gone
to
look
for
their
dear
comrades
and
found
their
bones
picked
as
clean
by
the
crows
as
these
i
doubt
have
been
by
thee
and
thy
mates
men
and
women
saidst
thou
and
prithee
when
spake
i
a
word
of
women
bones
wouldst
make
a
child
suspect
thee
field
of
battle
comrade
was
not
this
house
a
field
of
battle
half
an
hour
agone
drag
him
close
to
me
let
me
read
his
face
now
then
what
is
this
thou
knave
and
he
thrust
a
small
object
suddenly
in
his
face
alas
i
know
well
i
would
not
swear
neither
but
it
is
too
like
the
thumb
bone
of
a
man
hand
mates
my
flesh
it
creeps
churchyard
how
know
i
this
is
not
one
and
he
now
drew
his
sword
out
of
the
scabbard
and
began
to
rake
the
heap
of
earth
and
broken
crockery
and
bones
out
on
the
floor
the
landlord
assured
him
he
but
wasted
his
time
we
poor
innkeepers
are
sinners
said
he
we
give
short
measure
and
baptize
the
wine
we
are
fain
to
do
these
things
the
laws
are
so
unjust
to
us
but
we
are
not
assassins
how
could
we
afford
to
kill
our
customers
may
lightning
strike
me
dead
if
there
be
any
bones
there
but
such
as
have
been
used
for
meat
is
the
kitchen
wench
flings
them
here
i
swear
by
god
holy
mother
by
holy
paul
by
holy
dominic
and
denys
my
patron
saint
ah
denys
held
out
a
bone
under
his
eye
in
dead
silence
it
was
a
bone
no
man
however
ignorant
however
lying
could
confound
with
those
of
sheep
or
oxen
the
sight
of
it
shut
the
lying
lips
and
palsied
the
heartless
heart
the
landlord
hair
rose
visibly
on
his
head
like
spikes
and
his
knees
gave
way
as
if
his
limbs
had
been
struck
from
under
him
but
the
archers
dragged
him
fiercely
up
and
kept
him
erect
under
the
torch
staring
fascinated
at
the
dead
skull
which
white
as
the
living
cheek
opposed
but
no
whiter
glared
back
again
at
its
murderer
whose
pale
lip
now
opened
and
opened
but
could
utter
no
sound
ah
said
denys
solemnly
and
trembling
now
with
rage
look
on
the
sockets
out
of
which
thou
hast
picked
the
eyes
and
let
them
blast
thine
eyes
that
crows
shall
pick
out
ere
this
week
shall
end
now
hold
thou
that
while
i
search
on
hold
it
i
say
or
here
i
rob
the
gallows
and
he
threatened
the
quaking
wretch
with
his
naked
sword
till
with
a
groan
he
took
the
skull
and
held
it
almost
fainting
oh
that
every
murderer
and
contriver
of
murder
could
see
him
sick
and
staggering
with
terror
and
with
his
hair
on
end
holding
the
cold
skull
and
feeling
that
his
own
head
would
soon
be
like
it
and
soon
the
heap
was
scattered
and
alas
not
one
nor
two
but
many
skulls
were
brought
to
light
the
culprit
moaning
at
each
discovery
suddenly
denys
uttered
a
strange
cry
of
distress
to
come
from
so
bold
and
hard
a
man
and
held
up
to
the
torch
a
mass
of
human
hair
it
was
long
glossy
and
golden
a
woman
beautiful
hair
at
the
sight
of
it
the
archers
instinctively
shook
the
craven
wretch
in
their
hands
and
he
whined
i
have
a
little
sister
with
hair
just
so
fair
and
shining
as
this
gulped
denys
jesu
if
it
should
be
hers
there
quick
take
my
sword
and
dagger
and
keep
them
from
my
hand
lest
i
strike
him
dead
and
wrong
the
gibbet
and
thou
poor
innocent
victim
on
whose
head
this
most
lovely
hair
did
grow
hear
me
swear
this
on
bended
knee
never
to
leave
this
man
till
i
see
him
broken
to
pieces
on
the
wheel
even
for
thy
he
rose
from
his
knee
ay
had
he
as
many
lives
as
here
be
hairs
have
them
all
by
god
and
he
put
the
hair
into
his
bosom
then
in
a
sudden
fury
seized
the
landlord
fiercely
by
the
neck
and
forced
him
to
his
knees
and
foot
on
head
ground
his
face
savagely
among
the
bones
of
his
victims
where
they
lay
thickest
and
the
assassin
first
yelled
then
whined
and
whimpered
just
as
a
dog
first
yells
then
whines
when
his
nose
is
so
forced
into
some
leveret
or
other
innocent
he
has
killed
now
lend
me
thy
bowstring
philippe
he
passed
it
through
the
eyes
of
a
skull
alternately
and
hung
the
ghastly
relic
of
mortality
and
crime
round
the
man
neck
then
pulled
him
up
and
kicked
him
industriously
into
the
kitchen
where
one
of
the
aldermen
of
the
burgh
had
arrived
with
constables
and
was
even
now
taking
an
archer
deposition
the
grave
burgher
was
much
startled
at
sight
of
the
landlord
driven
in
bleeding
from
a
dozen
scratches
inflicted
by
the
bones
of
his
own
victims
and
carrying
his
horrible
collar
but
denys
came
panting
after
and
in
a
few
fiery
words
soon
made
all
clear
bind
him
like
the
rest
said
the
alderman
sternly
i
count
him
the
blackest
of
them
while
his
hands
were
being
bound
the
poor
wretch
begged
piteously
that
the
skull
might
be
taken
from
humph
said
the
alderman
certes
i
had
not
ordered
such
a
thing
to
be
put
on
mortal
man
yet
being
there
i
will
not
lift
voice
nor
finger
to
doff
it
methinks
it
fits
thee
truly
thou
bloody
dog
is
thy
ensign
and
hangs
well
above
a
heart
so
foul
as
he
then
inquired
of
denys
if
he
thought
they
had
secured
the
whole
gang
or
but
a
part
your
worship
said
denys
there
are
but
seven
of
them
and
this
landlord
one
we
slew
upstairs
one
we
trundled
down
dead
the
rest
are
bound
before
good
go
fetch
the
dead
one
from
upstairs
and
lay
him
beside
him
i
caused
to
be
here
a
voice
like
a
broke
peevishly
in
now
now
now
where
is
the
hand
that
is
what
i
want
to
the
speaker
was
a
little
pettifogging
clerk
you
will
find
it
above
nailed
to
the
by
a
crossbow
good
said
the
clerk
he
whispered
his
master
what
a
goodly
show
will
the
de
conviction
make
and
with
this
he
wrote
them
down
enumerating
them
in
separate
squeaks
as
he
penned
them
skulls
bones
a
woman
hair
a
thief
hands
axe
carcasses
crossbow
bolt
this
done
he
itched
to
search
the
cellar
himself
there
might
be
other
invaluable
morsels
of
evidence
an
ear
or
even
an
earring
the
alderman
assenting
he
caught
up
a
torch
and
was
hurrying
thither
when
an
accident
stopped
him
and
indeed
carried
him
a
step
or
two
in
the
opposite
direction
the
constables
had
gone
up
the
stair
in
single
file
but
the
head
constable
no
sooner
saw
the
phosphorescent
corpse
seated
by
the
bedside
than
he
stood
stupefied
and
next
he
began
to
shake
like
one
in
an
ague
and
terror
gaining
on
him
more
and
more
he
uttered
a
sort
of
howl
and
recoiled
swiftly
forgetting
the
steps
in
his
recoil
he
tumbled
over
backward
on
his
nearest
companion
but
he
shaken
by
the
shout
of
dismay
and
catching
a
glimpse
of
something
horrid
was
already
staggering
back
and
in
no
condition
to
sustain
the
head
constable
who
like
most
head
constables
was
a
ponderous
man
the
two
carried
away
the
third
and
the
three
the
fourth
and
they
streamed
into
the
kitchen
and
settled
on
the
floor
overlapping
each
other
like
a
sequence
laid
out
on
a
the
clerk
coming
hastily
with
his
torch
ran
an
involuntary
tilt
against
the
fourth
man
who
sharing
the
momentum
of
the
mass
knocked
him
instantly
on
his
back
the
ace
of
that
fair
quint
and
there
he
lay
kicking
and
waving
his
torch
apparently
in
triumph
but
really
in
convulsion
sense
and
wind
being
driven
out
together
by
the
concussion
what
is
to
do
now
in
heaven
name
cried
the
alderman
starting
up
with
considerable
alarm
but
denys
explained
and
offered
to
accompany
his
worship
so
be
it
said
the
latter
his
men
picked
themselves
ruefully
up
and
the
alderman
put
himself
at
their
head
and
examined
the
premises
above
and
below
as
for
the
prisoners
their
interrogatory
was
postponed
till
they
could
be
confronted
with
the
servant
before
dawn
the
thieves
alive
and
dead
and
all
the
relics
and
evidences
of
crime
and
retribution
were
swept
away
into
the
net
and
the
inn
was
silent
and
almost
deserted
there
remained
but
one
constable
and
denys
and
gerard
the
latter
still
sleeping
heavily
chapter
xxxv
gerard
awoke
and
found
denys
watching
him
with
some
anxiety
it
is
you
for
sleeping
why
is
high
it
was
a
blessed
sleep
said
gerard
methinks
heaven
sent
it
me
it
hath
put
as
it
were
a
veil
between
me
and
that
awful
night
to
think
that
you
and
i
sit
here
alive
and
well
how
terrible
a
dream
i
seem
to
have
had
ay
lad
that
is
the
wise
way
to
look
at
these
things
when
once
they
are
past
why
they
are
dreams
shadows
break
thy
fast
and
then
thou
wilt
think
no
more
o
moreover
i
promised
to
bring
thee
on
to
the
town
by
noon
and
take
thee
to
his
gerard
then
sopped
some
rye
bread
in
red
wine
and
ate
it
to
break
his
fast
then
went
with
denys
over
the
scene
of
combat
and
came
back
shuddering
and
finally
took
the
road
with
his
friend
and
kept
peering
through
the
hedges
and
expecting
sudden
attacks
unreasonably
till
they
reached
the
little
town
denys
took
him
to
the
white
hart
no
fear
of
here
said
he
i
know
the
landlord
this
many
a
year
he
is
a
burgess
and
looks
to
be
bailiff
is
here
i
was
making
for
yestreen
but
we
lost
time
and
night
us
and
and
you
saw
a
woman
at
the
door
and
would
be
wiser
than
a
jeanneton
she
told
us
they
were
why
what
saved
our
lives
if
not
a
woman
ay
and
risked
her
own
to
do
that
is
true
denys
and
though
women
are
nothing
to
me
i
long
to
thank
this
poor
girl
and
reward
her
ay
though
i
share
every
doit
in
my
purse
with
her
do
not
you
where
shall
we
find
her
mayhap
the
alderman
will
tell
us
we
must
go
to
him
the
alderman
received
them
with
a
most
singular
and
inexplicable
expression
of
countenance
however
after
a
moment
reflection
he
wore
a
grim
smile
and
finally
proceeded
to
put
interrogatories
to
gerard
and
took
down
the
answers
this
done
he
told
them
that
they
must
stay
in
the
town
till
the
thieves
were
tried
and
be
at
hand
to
give
evidence
on
peril
of
fine
and
imprisonment
they
looked
very
blank
at
this
however
said
he
not
be
long
the
culprits
having
been
taken
he
added
and
you
know
in
any
case
you
could
not
leave
the
place
this
denys
stared
at
this
remark
and
gerard
smiled
at
what
he
thought
the
simplicity
of
the
old
gentleman
in
dreaming
that
a
provincial
town
of
burgundy
had
attraction
to
detain
him
from
rome
and
margaret
he
now
went
to
that
which
was
nearest
both
their
hearts
your
worship
said
he
we
can
not
find
our
benefactress
in
the
nay
but
who
is
your
benefactress
who
why
the
good
girl
that
came
to
you
by
night
and
saved
our
lives
at
peril
of
her
own
oh
sir
our
hearts
burn
within
us
to
thank
and
bless
her
where
is
she
chapter
xxxvi
in
prison
sir
good
lack
for
what
misdeed
well
she
is
a
witness
and
may
be
a
necessary
why
messire
bailiff
put
in
denys
you
lay
not
all
your
witnesses
by
the
heels
i
the
alderman
pleased
at
being
called
bailiff
became
communicative
in
a
case
of
blood
we
detain
all
testimony
that
is
like
to
give
us
leg
bail
and
so
defeat
justice
and
that
is
why
we
still
keep
the
women
folk
for
a
man
at
odd
times
hides
a
week
in
one
mind
but
a
woman
if
she
do
her
duty
to
the
realm
o
friday
she
shall
undo
it
afore
sunday
or
try
could
you
see
yon
wench
now
you
should
find
her
at
having
betrayed
five
males
to
the
gallows
had
they
been
females
we
might
have
trusted
to
a
subpoena
for
they
despise
one
another
and
there
they
show
some
sense
but
now
i
think
o
there
were
other
reasons
for
laying
this
one
by
the
heels
hand
me
those
depositions
young
and
he
put
on
his
glasses
ay
she
was
implicated
she
was
one
of
the
a
loud
disclaimer
burst
from
denys
and
gerard
at
once
no
need
to
deave
me
said
the
alderman
here
is
in
black
and
white
hardy
that
is
one
of
the
thieves
being
questioned
confessed
that
humph
ay
here
is
that
the
girl
manon
was
the
decoy
and
her
sweetheart
was
georges
vipont
one
of
the
band
and
hanged
last
month
and
that
she
had
been
deject
ever
since
and
had
openly
blamed
the
band
for
his
death
saying
if
they
had
not
been
rank
cowards
he
had
never
been
taken
and
it
is
his
opinion
she
did
but
betray
them
out
of
very
spite
and
his
opinion
cried
gerard
indignantly
what
signifies
the
opinion
of
a
burning
to
be
revenged
on
her
who
has
delivered
him
to
justice
and
an
you
go
to
that
what
avails
his
testimony
is
a
thief
never
a
liar
is
he
not
aye
a
liar
and
here
a
motive
to
lie
revenge
why
is
the
strongest
of
all
the
passions
and
oh
sir
what
madness
to
question
a
detected
felon
and
listen
to
him
lying
away
an
honest
life
as
if
he
were
a
true
man
swearing
in
open
day
with
his
true
hand
on
the
gospel
laid
young
man
said
the
alderman
restrain
thy
heat
in
presence
of
authority
i
find
by
your
tone
you
are
a
stranger
know
then
that
in
this
land
we
question
all
the
world
we
are
not
so
weak
as
to
hope
to
get
at
the
truth
by
shutting
either
our
left
ear
or
our
and
so
you
would
listen
to
satan
belying
the
saints
ta
ta
the
law
meddles
but
with
men
and
women
and
these
can
not
utter
a
story
all
lies
let
them
try
ever
so
wherefore
we
shut
not
the
as
the
saying
is
against
any
man
grain
only
having
taken
it
in
we
do
winnow
and
sift
it
and
who
told
you
i
had
swallowed
the
thief
story
whole
like
fair
water
not
so
i
did
but
credit
so
much
o
as
was
borne
out
by
better
better
proof
and
gerard
looked
blank
why
who
but
the
thieves
would
breathe
a
word
against
her
marry
herself
sir
what
did
you
question
her
too
i
tell
you
we
question
all
the
world
here
is
her
deposition
can
you
read
read
it
yourself
gerard
looked
at
denys
and
read
him
manon
deposition
i
am
a
native
of
epinal
i
left
my
native
place
two
years
ago
because
i
was
unfortunate
i
could
not
like
the
man
they
bade
me
so
my
father
beat
me
i
ran
away
from
my
father
i
went
to
service
i
left
service
because
the
mistress
was
jealous
of
me
the
reason
that
she
gave
for
turning
me
off
was
because
i
was
saucy
last
year
i
stood
in
the
marketplace
to
be
hired
with
other
girls
the
landlord
of
fair
star
hired
me
i
was
eleven
months
with
him
a
young
man
courted
me
i
loved
him
i
found
out
that
travellers
came
and
never
went
away
again
i
told
my
lover
he
bade
me
hold
my
peace
he
threatened
me
i
found
my
lover
was
one
of
a
band
of
thieves
when
travellers
were
to
be
robbed
the
landlord
went
out
and
told
the
band
to
come
then
i
wept
and
prayed
for
the
travellers
souls
i
never
told
a
month
ago
my
lover
died
the
soldier
put
me
in
mind
of
my
lover
he
was
bearded
like
him
i
had
lost
i
can
not
tell
whether
i
should
have
interfered
if
he
had
had
no
beard
i
am
sorry
i
told
the
paper
almost
dropped
from
gerard
hands
now
for
the
first
time
he
saw
that
manon
life
was
in
mortal
danger
he
knew
the
dogged
law
and
the
dogged
men
that
executed
it
he
threw
himself
suddenly
on
his
knees
at
the
alderman
feet
oh
sir
think
of
the
difference
between
those
cruel
men
and
this
poor
weak
woman
could
you
have
the
heart
to
send
her
to
the
same
death
with
them
could
you
have
the
heart
to
condemn
us
to
look
on
and
see
her
slaughtered
who
but
that
she
risked
her
life
for
ours
had
not
now
been
in
jeopardy
alas
sir
show
me
and
my
comrade
some
pity
if
you
have
none
for
her
poor
soul
denys
and
i
be
true
men
and
you
will
rend
our
hearts
if
you
kill
that
poor
simple
girl
what
can
we
do
what
is
left
for
us
to
do
then
but
cut
our
throats
at
her
gallows
foot
the
alderman
was
tough
but
mortal
the
prayers
and
agitation
of
gerard
first
astounded
then
touched
him
he
showed
it
in
a
curious
way
he
became
peevish
and
fretful
there
get
up
do
said
he
i
doubt
whether
anybody
would
say
as
many
words
for
me
what
ho
daniel
go
fetch
the
town
and
on
that
functionary
entering
from
an
adjoining
room
here
is
a
foolish
lad
fretting
about
yon
girl
can
we
stretch
a
point
say
we
admit
her
to
bear
witness
and
question
her
the
town
clerk
was
one
of
your
impossibility
men
nay
sir
we
can
not
do
that
she
was
not
concerned
in
this
business
had
she
been
accessory
we
might
have
offered
her
a
pardon
to
bear
gerard
burst
in
but
she
did
better
instead
of
being
accessory
she
stayed
the
crime
and
she
proffered
herself
as
witness
by
running
hither
with
the
tush
young
man
is
a
matter
of
the
alderman
and
the
clerk
then
had
a
long
discussion
the
one
maintaining
the
other
denying
that
she
stood
as
fair
in
law
as
if
she
had
been
accessory
to
the
attempt
on
our
travellers
lives
and
this
was
lucky
for
manon
for
the
alderman
irritated
by
the
clerk
reiterating
that
he
could
not
do
this
and
could
not
that
and
could
not
do
said
he
would
show
him
he
could
do
anything
he
chose
and
he
had
manon
out
and
upon
the
landlord
of
the
white
hart
being
her
bondsman
and
denys
depositing
five
gold
pieces
with
him
and
the
girl
promising
not
without
some
coaxing
from
denys
to
attend
as
a
witness
he
liberated
her
but
eased
his
conscience
by
telling
her
in
his
own
terms
his
reason
for
this
leniency
the
town
had
to
buy
a
new
rope
for
everybody
hanged
and
present
it
to
the
bourreau
or
compound
with
him
in
money
and
she
was
not
in
his
opinion
worth
this
municipal
expense
whereas
decided
characters
like
her
late
confederates
and
so
denys
and
gerard
carried
her
off
gerard
dancing
round
her
for
joy
denys
keeping
up
her
heart
by
assuring
her
of
the
demise
of
a
troublesome
personage
and
she
weeping
inauspiciously
however
on
the
road
to
the
white
hart
the
public
found
her
out
and
having
heard
the
whole
story
from
the
archers
who
naturally
told
it
warmly
in
her
favour
followed
her
hurrahing
and
encouraging
her
till
finding
herself
backed
by
numbers
she
plucked
up
heart
the
landlord
too
saw
at
a
glance
that
her
presence
in
the
inn
would
draw
custom
and
received
her
politely
and
assigned
her
an
upper
chamber
here
she
buried
herself
and
being
alone
rained
tears
again
poor
little
mind
it
was
like
a
ripple
up
and
down
down
and
up
up
and
down
bidding
the
landlord
be
very
kind
to
her
and
keep
her
a
prisoner
without
letting
her
feel
it
the
friends
went
out
and
lo
as
they
stepped
into
the
street
they
saw
two
processions
coming
towards
them
from
opposite
sides
one
was
a
large
one
attended
with
noise
and
howls
and
those
indescribable
cries
by
which
rude
natures
reveal
at
odd
times
that
relationship
to
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
forest
which
at
other
times
we
succeed
in
hiding
the
other
very
thinly
attended
by
a
few
nuns
and
friars
came
slow
and
silent
the
prisoners
going
to
exposure
in
the
the
gathered
bones
of
the
victims
coming
to
the
churchyard
and
the
two
met
in
the
narrow
street
nearly
at
the
inn
door
and
could
not
pass
each
other
for
a
long
time
and
the
bier
that
bore
the
relics
of
mortality
got
wedged
against
the
cart
that
carried
the
men
who
had
made
those
bones
what
they
were
and
in
a
few
hours
must
die
for
it
themselves
the
mob
had
not
the
quick
intelligence
to
be
at
once
struck
with
this
stern
meeting
but
at
last
a
woman
cried
look
at
your
work
ye
dogs
and
the
crowd
took
it
like
wildfire
and
there
was
a
horrible
yell
and
the
culprits
groaned
and
tried
to
hide
their
heads
upon
their
bosoms
but
could
not
their
hands
being
tied
and
there
they
stood
images
of
pale
despair
and
oh
how
they
looked
on
the
bier
and
envied
those
whom
they
had
sent
before
them
on
the
dark
road
they
were
going
upon
themselves
and
the
two
men
who
were
the
cause
of
both
processions
stood
and
looked
gravely
on
and
even
manon
hearing
the
disturbance
crept
to
the
window
and
hiding
her
face
peeped
trembling
through
her
fingers
as
women
will
this
strange
meeting
parted
denys
and
gerard
the
former
yielded
to
curiosity
and
revenge
the
latter
doffed
his
bonnet
and
piously
followed
the
poor
remains
of
those
whose
fate
had
so
nearly
been
his
own
for
some
time
he
was
the
one
lay
mourner
but
when
they
had
reached
the
suburbs
a
long
way
from
the
greater
attraction
that
was
filling
the
more
than
one
artisan
threw
down
his
tools
and
more
than
one
shopman
left
his
shop
and
touched
with
pity
or
a
sense
of
our
common
humanity
and
perhaps
decided
somewhat
by
the
example
of
gerard
followed
the
bones
bareheaded
and
saw
them
deposited
with
the
prayers
of
the
church
in
hallowed
ground
after
the
funeral
rites
gerard
stepped
respectfully
up
to
the
cure
and
offered
to
buy
a
mass
for
their
souls
gerard
son
of
catherine
always
looked
at
two
sides
of
a
penny
and
he
tried
to
purchase
this
mass
a
trifle
under
the
usual
terms
on
account
of
the
pitiable
circumstances
but
the
good
cure
gently
but
adroitly
parried
his
ingenuity
and
blandly
screwed
him
up
to
the
market
price
in
the
course
of
the
business
they
discovered
a
similarity
of
sentiments
piety
and
worldly
prudence
are
not
very
rare
companions
still
it
is
unusual
to
carry
both
so
far
as
these
two
men
did
their
collision
in
the
prayer
market
led
to
mutual
esteem
as
when
knight
encountered
knight
worthy
of
his
steel
moreover
the
good
cure
loved
a
bit
of
gossip
and
finding
his
customer
was
one
of
those
who
had
fought
the
thieves
at
domfront
would
have
him
into
his
parlour
and
hear
the
whole
from
his
own
lips
and
his
heart
warmed
to
gerard
and
he
said
god
was
good
to
thee
i
thank
him
with
all
my
soul
thou
art
a
good
he
added
drily
shouldst
have
told
me
this
tale
in
the
churchyard
i
doubt
i
had
given
thee
the
mass
for
love
however
said
he
the
thermometer
suddenly
falling
is
ill
luck
to
go
back
upon
a
bargain
but
i
broach
a
bottle
of
my
old
medoc
for
thee
and
few
be
the
guests
i
would
do
that
the
cure
went
to
his
cupboard
and
while
he
groped
for
the
choice
bottle
he
muttered
to
himself
at
their
old
tricks
again
said
gerard
i
said
nought
ay
here
is
nay
your
reverence
you
surely
spoke
you
said
their
old
tricks
again
said
i
so
in
sooth
and
his
reverence
smiled
he
then
proceeded
to
broach
the
wine
and
filled
a
cup
for
each
then
he
put
a
log
of
wood
on
the
fire
for
stoves
were
none
in
burgundy
and
so
i
said
their
old
tricks
did
i
come
sip
the
good
wine
and
whilst
it
lasts
story
for
story
i
care
not
if
i
tell
you
a
little
gerard
eyes
sparkled
thou
lovest
a
story
as
my
nay
but
raise
not
thine
expectations
too
high
neither
is
but
a
foolish
trifle
compared
with
thine
the
cure
tale
once
upon
a
time
then
in
the
kingdom
of
france
and
in
the
duchy
of
burgundy
and
not
a
day
journey
from
the
town
where
now
we
sit
of
old
medoc
there
lived
a
cure
i
say
he
lived
but
barely
the
parish
was
small
the
parishioners
greedy
and
never
gave
their
cure
a
doit
more
than
he
could
compel
the
nearer
they
brought
him
to
a
disembodied
spirit
by
meagre
diet
the
holier
should
be
his
prayers
in
their
behalf
i
know
not
if
this
was
their
creed
but
their
practice
gave
it
colour
at
last
he
pickled
a
rod
for
them
one
day
the
richest
farmer
in
the
place
had
twins
to
baptize
the
cure
was
had
to
the
christening
dinner
as
usual
but
ere
he
would
baptize
the
children
he
demanded
not
the
christening
fees
only
but
the
burial
fees
defend
us
parson
cried
the
mother
not
of
burying
i
did
never
see
children
liker
to
live
i
said
the
cure
praise
be
to
god
natheless
they
are
sure
to
die
being
sons
of
adam
as
well
as
of
thee
dame
but
die
when
they
will
cost
them
nothing
the
burial
fees
being
paid
and
entered
in
this
book
all
that
cost
them
something
quoth
the
miller
the
greatest
wag
in
the
place
and
as
big
a
knave
as
any
for
which
was
the
biggest
god
knoweth
but
no
mortal
man
not
even
the
hangman
i
tell
thee
nay
quo
the
cure
i
tell
you
ay
quo
the
miller
cost
them
their
lives
at
which
millstone
conceit
was
a
great
laugh
and
in
the
general
mirth
the
fees
were
paid
and
the
christians
made
but
when
the
next
parishioner
child
and
the
next
after
and
all
had
to
pay
each
his
burial
fee
or
lose
his
place
in
heaven
discontent
did
secretly
rankle
in
the
parish
well
one
fine
day
they
met
in
secret
and
sent
a
churchwarden
with
a
complaint
to
the
bishop
and
a
thunderbolt
fell
on
the
poor
cure
came
to
him
at
a
summons
to
the
episcopal
palace
to
bring
the
parish
books
and
answer
certain
charges
then
the
cure
guessed
where
the
shoe
pinched
he
left
his
food
on
the
board
for
small
his
appetite
now
and
took
the
parish
books
and
went
quaking
the
bishop
entertained
him
with
a
frown
and
exposed
the
plaint
said
the
cure
right
humbly
the
parish
allege
many
things
against
me
or
this
one
only
sooth
but
this
one
said
the
bishop
and
softened
a
little
monseigneur
i
acknowledge
the
fact
well
quoth
the
bishop
saves
time
and
trouble
now
to
your
excuse
if
excuse
there
be
i
have
been
cure
of
that
parish
seven
years
and
fifty
children
have
i
baptized
and
buried
not
five
at
first
i
used
to
say
heaven
be
praised
the
air
of
this
village
is
main
healthy
but
on
searching
the
register
book
i
found
always
so
and
on
probing
the
matter
it
came
out
that
of
those
born
at
domfront
all
but
here
and
there
one
did
go
and
get
hanged
at
aix
but
this
was
to
defraud
not
their
cure
only
but
the
entire
church
of
her
dues
since
pendards
pay
no
funeral
fees
being
buried
in
air
thereupon
knowing
by
sad
experience
their
greed
and
how
they
grudge
the
church
every
sou
i
laid
a
trap
to
keep
them
from
hanging
for

against
greed
there
be
of
them
that
will
die
in
their
beds
like
true
men
ere
the
church
shall
gain
those
funeral
fees
for
nought
then
the
bishop
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
and
questioned
the
churchwarden
and
he
was
fain
to
confess
that
too
many
of
the
parish
did
come
to
that
unlucky
end
at
aix
said
the
bishop
do
approve
the
act
for
myself
and
my
successors
and
so
be
it
ever
till
they
mend
their
manners
and
die
in
their
beds
and
the
next
day
came
the
ringleaders
crestfallen
to
the
cure
and
said
ye
were
even
good
to
us
barring
this
untoward
matter
prithee
let
there
be
no
ill
blood
anent
so
trivial
a
thing
and
the
cure
said
children
i
were
unworthy
to
be
your
pastor
could
i
not
forgive
a
wrong
go
in
peace
and
get
me
as
many
children
as
may
be
that
by
the
double
fees
the
cure
you
love
may
miss
starvation
and
the
bishop
often
told
the
story
and
it
kept
his
memory
of
the
cure
alive
and
at
last
he
shifted
him
to
a
decent
parish
where
he
can
offer
a
glass
of
old
medoc
to
such
as
are
worthy
of
it
their
name
it
is
not
a
light
broke
in
upon
gerard
his
countenance
showed
it
ay
said
his
host
i
am
that
cure
so
now
thou
canst
guess
why
i
said
their
old
tricks
my
life
o
they
have
wheedled
my
successor
into
remitting
those
funeral
fees
you
are
well
out
of
that
parish
and
so
am
the
cure
little
niece
burst
in
uncle
the
weighing
la
a
stranger
and
burst
out
the
cure
rose
directly
but
would
not
part
with
gerard
wet
thy
beard
once
more
and
come
with
in
the
church
porch
they
found
the
sexton
with
a
huge
pair
of
scales
and
weights
of
all
sizes
several
humble
persons
were
standing
by
and
soon
a
woman
stepped
forward
with
a
sickly
child
and
said
be
it
heavy
be
it
light
i
vow
in
rye
meal
of
the
best
this
child
shall
weigh
and
the
same
will
duly
pay
to
holy
church
an
if
he
shall
cast
his
trouble
pray
good
people
for
this
child
and
for
me
his
mother
hither
come
in
dole
and
care
the
child
was
weighed
and
yelled
as
if
the
scale
had
been
the
font
courage
dame
cried
gerard
this
is
a
good
sign
there
is
plenty
of
life
here
to
battle
its
now
blest
be
the
tongue
that
tells
me
so
said
the
poor
woman
she
hushed
her
ponderling
against
her
bosom
and
stood
aloof
watching
whilst
another
woman
brought
her
child
to
scale
but
presently
a
loud
dictatorial
voice
was
heard
way
there
make
way
for
the
seigneur
the
small
folk
parted
on
both
sides
like
waves
ploughed
by
a
lordly
galley
and
in
marched
in
gorgeous
attire
his
cap
adorned
by
a
feather
with
a
topaz
at
its
root
his
jerkin
richly
furred
satin
doublet
red
hose
shoes
like
skates
sword
in
velvet
scabbard
and
hawk
on
his
wrist
the
lord
of
the
he
flung
himself
into
the
scales
as
if
he
was
lord
of
the
zodiac
as
well
as
the
manor
whereat
the
hawk
balanced
and
flapped
but
stuck
then
winked
while
the
sexton
heaved
in
the
great
weights
the
cure
told
gerard
my
lord
had
been
sick
unto
death
and
vowed
his
weight
in
bread
and
cheese
to
the
poor
the
church
taking
her
permit
me
my
lord
if
your
lordship
continues
to
press
your
staff
on
the
other
scale
you
will
disturb
the
his
lordship
grinned
and
removed
his
staff
and
leaned
on
it
the
cure
politely
but
firmly
objected
to
that
too
mille
diables
what
am
i
to
do
with
it
then
cried
the
other
deign
to
hold
it
out
so
my
lord
wide
of
both
when
my
lord
did
this
and
so
fell
into
the
trap
he
had
laid
for
holy
church
the
good
cure
whispered
to
gerard
cretensis
incidit
in
cretensem
which
i
take
to
mean
diamond
cut
he
then
said
with
an
obsequious
air
if
that
your
lordship
grudges
heaven
full
weight
you
might
set
the
hawk
on
your
lacquey
and
so
save
a
gramercy
for
thy
rede
cure
cried
the
great
man
reproachfully
shall
i
for
one
sorry
pound
grudge
my
poor
fowl
the
benefit
of
holy
church
i
as
lieve
the
devil
should
have
me
and
all
my
house
as
her
any
day
i
the
sweet
is
affection
whispered
the
cure
between
a
bird
and
a
brute
whispered
gerard
tush
and
the
cure
looked
terrified
the
seigneur
weight
was
booked
and
heaven
i
trust
and
believe
did
not
weigh
his
gratitude
in
the
balance
of
the
sanctuary
for
my
unlearned
reader
is
not
to
suppose
there
was
anything
the
least
eccentric
in
the
man
or
his
gratitude
to
the
giver
of
health
and
all
good
gifts
men
look
forward
to
death
and
back
upon
past
sickness
with
different
eyes
item
when
men
drive
a
bargain
they
strive
to
get
the
sunny
side
of
it
it
matters
not
one
straw
whether
it
is
with
man
or
heaven
they
are
bargaining
in
this
respect
we
are
the
same
now
at
bottom
as
we
were
four
hundred
years
ago
only
in
those
days
we
did
it
a
grain
or
two
more
naively
and
that
naivete
shone
out
more
palpably
because
in
that
rude
age
body
prevailing
over

all
sentiments
took
material

whilst
i
have
been
preaching
who
preach
so
rarely
and
so
ill
the
good
cure
has
been
soliciting
the
lord
of
the
manor
to
step
into
the
church
and
give
order
what
shall
be
done
with
his
ods
bodikins
what
have
you
dug
him
up
nay
my
lord
he
never
was
what
the
old
dict
was
true
after
all
so
true
that
the
workmen
this
very
day
found
a
skeleton
erect
in
the
pillar
they
are
repairing
i
had
sent
to
my
lord
at
once
but
i
knew
he
would
be
it
is
he
is
he
said
his
descendant
quickening
his
pace
let
us
go
see
the
old
boy
this
youth
is
a
stranger
i
gerard
bowed
know
then
that
my
held
his
head
high
and
being
on
the
point
of
death
revolted
against
lying
under
the
aisle
with
his
forbears
for
mean
folk
to
pass
over
so
as
the
tradition
goes
he
swore
his
son
my
to
bury
him
erect
in
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
church
here
they
entered
the
porch
quoth
he
base
man
shall
pass
over
my
stomach
peste
and
even
while
speaking
his
lordship
parried
adroitly
with
his
stick
a
skull
that
came
hopping
at
him
bowled
by
a
boy
in
the
middle
of
the
aisle
who
took
to
his
heels
yelling
with
fear
the
moment
he
saw
what
he
had
done
his
lordship
hurled
the
skull
furiously
after
him
as
he
ran
at
which
the
cure
gave
a
shout
of
dismay
and
put
forth
his
arm
to
hinder
him
but
was
too
late
the
cure
groaned
aloud
and
as
if
this
had
evoked
spirits
of
mischief
up
started
a
whole
pack
of
children
from
some
ambuscade
and
unseen
but
heard
loud
enough
clattered
out
of
the
church
like
a
covey
rising
in
a
thick
wood
oh
these
pernicious
brats
cried
the
cure
the
workmen
can
not
go
to
their
nonemete
but
the
church
is
rife
with
them
pray
heaven
they
have
not
found
his
late
lordship
nay
i
mind
i
hid
his
lordship
under
a
workmen
jerkin
and
saints
defend
us
the
jerkin
has
been
the
poor
cure
worst
misgivings
were
realized
the
rising
generation
of
the
plebians
had
played
the
mischief
with
the
haughty
old
noble
the
little
ones
had
jockeyed
for
the
bones
oh
and
pocketed
such
of
them
as
seemed
adapted
for
certain
primitive
games
then
in
vogue
amongst
them
i
excommunicate
them
roared
the
curate
and
all
their
never
heed
said
the
scapegrace
lord
and
stroked
his
hawk
there
is
enough
of
him
to
swear
by
put
him
back
put
him
back
surely
my
lord
is
your
will
his
bones
be
laid
in
hallowed
earth
and
masses
said
for
his
poor
prideful
soul
the
noble
stroked
his
hawk
are
ye
there
master
cure
said
he
nay
the
business
is
too
old
he
is
out
of
purgatory
by
this
time
up
or
down
i
shall
not
draw
my
for
him
every
dog
his
day
adieu
messires
adieu
ancestor
and
he
sauntered
off
whistling
to
his
hawk
and
caressing
it
his
reverence
looked
ruefully
after
him
cretensis
incidit
in
cretensem
said
he
sorrowfully
i
thought
i
had
him
safe
for
a
dozen
masses
yet
i
blame
him
not
but
that
young
which
did
trundle
his
ancestor
skull
at
us
for
who
could
venerate
his
and
play
football
with
his
head
well
it
behoves
us
to
be
better
christians
than
he
so
they
gathered
the
bones
reverently
and
the
cure
locked
them
up
and
forbade
the
workmen
who
now
entered
the
church
to
close
up
the
pillar
till
he
should
recover
by
threats
of
the
church
wrath
every
atom
of
my
lord
and
he
showed
gerard
a
famous
shrine
in
the
church
before
it
were
the
usual
gifts
of
tapers
etc
there
was
also
a
wax
image
of
a
falcon
most
curiously
moulded
and
coloured
to
the
life
eyes
and
all
gerard
eye
fell
at
once
on
this
and
he
expressed
the
liveliest
admiration
the
cure
assented
then
gerard
asked
could
the
saint
have
loved
hawking
the
cure
laughed
at
his
simplicity
nay
is
but
a
statuary
hawk
when
they
have
a
bird
of
gentle
breed
they
can
not
train
they
make
his
image
and
send
it
to
this
shrine
with
a
present
and
pray
the
saint
to
work
upon
the
stubborn
mind
of
the
original
and
make
it
ductile
as
wax
that
is
the
notion
and
methinks
a
reasonable
one
gerard
assented
but
alack
reverend
sir
were
i
a
saint
methinks
i
should
side
with
the
innocent
dove
rather
than
with
the
cruel
hawk
that
rends
by
denys
you
are
right
said
the
cure
but
que
the
saints
are
debonair
and
have
been
flesh
themselves
and
know
frailty
and
absurdity
is
the
bishop
of
avignon
sent
this
what
do
bishops
hawk
in
this
country
one
and
all
every
noble
person
hawks
and
lives
with
hawk
on
wrist
why
my
lord
abbot
hard
by
and
his
lordship
that
has
just
parted
from
us
had
a
two
years
feud
as
to
where
they
should
put
their
hawks
down
on
that
very
altar
there
each
claimed
the
right
hand
of
the
altar
for
his
what
desecration
nay
nay
thou
knowest
we
make
them
doff
both
glove
and
hawk
to
take
the
blessed
eucharist
their
jewelled
gloves
will
they
give
to
a
servant
or
simple
christian
to
hold
but
their
beloved
hawks
they
will
put
down
on
no
place
less
than
the
gerard
inquired
how
the
battle
of
the
hawks
ended
why
the
abbot
he
yielded
as
the
church
yields
to
laymen
he
searched
ancient
books
and
found
that
the
left
hand
was
the
more
honourable
being
in
truth
the
right
hand
since
the
altar
is
east
but
looks
westward
so
he
gave
my
lord
the
right
hand
and
contented
himself
with
the
real
right
hand
and
even
so
may
the
church
still
outwit
the
lay
nobles
and
their
arrogance
saving
your
nay
sir
i
honour
the

i
am
convent
bred
and
owe
all
i
have
and
am
to

that
accounts
for
my
sudden
liking

a
gracious
youth
come
and
see
me
whenever
thou
gerard
took
this
as
a
hint
that
he
might
go
now
it
jumped
with
his
own
wish
for
he
was
curious
to
hear
what
denys
had
seen
and
done
all
this
time
he
made
his
reverence
and
walked
out
of
the
church
but
was
no
sooner
clear
of
it
than
he
set
off
to
run
with
all
his
might
and
tearing
round
a
corner
ran
into
a
large
stomach
whose
owner
clutched
him
to
keep
himself
steady
under
the
shock
but
did
not
release
his
hold
on
regaining
his
equilibrium
let
go

chapter
xxxvii
the
culprits
were
condemned
to
stand
pinioned
in
the
marketplace
for
two
hours
that
should
any
persons
recognize
them
or
any
of
them
as
guilty
of
other
crimes
they
might
depose
to
that
effect
at
the
trial
they
stood
however
the
whole
period
and
no
one
advanced
anything
fresh
against
them
this
was
the
less
remarkable
that
they
were
night
birds
vampires
who
preyed
in
the
dark
on
weary
travellers
mostly
strangers
but
just
as
they
were
being
taken
down
a
fearful
scream
was
heard
in
the
crowd
and
a
woman
pointed
at
one
of
them
with
eyes
almost
starting
from
their
sockets
but
ere
she
could
speak
she
fainted
away
then
men
and
women
crowded
round
her
partly
to
aid
her
partly
from
curiosity
when
she
began
to
recover
they
fell
to
conjectures
was
at
him
she
nay
was
at
this
nay
nay
said
another
was
at
yon
hangdog
with
the
hair
hung
round
his
all
further
conjectures
were
cut
short
the
poor
creature
no
sooner
recovered
her
senses
than
she
flew
at
the
landlord
like
a
lioness
my
child
man
man
give
me
back
my
and
she
seized
the
glossy
golden
hair
that
the
officers
had
hung
round
his
neck
and
tore
it
from
his
neck
and
covered
it
with
kisses
then
her
poor
confused
mind
clearing
she
saw
even
by
this
token
that
her
lost
girl
was
dead
and
sank
suddenly
down
shrieking
and
sobbing
so
over
the
poor
hair
that
the
crowd
rushed
on
the
assassin
with
one
savage
growl
his
life
had
ended
then
and
speedily
for
in
those
days
all
carried
death
at
their
girdles
but
denys
drew
his
sword
directly
and
shouting
a
moi
camarades
kept
the
mob
at
bay
who
lays
a
finger
on
him
other
archers
backed
him
and
with
some
difficulty
they
kept
him
uninjured
while
denys
appealed
to
those
who
shouted
for
his
blood
what
sort
of
vengeance
is
this
would
you
be
so
mad
as
rob
the
wheel
and
give
the
vermin
an
easy
death
the
mob
was
kept
passive
by
the
archers
steel
rather
than
by
words
and
growled
at
intervals
with
flashing
eyes
the
municipal
officers
seeing
this
collected
round
and
with
the
archers
made
a
guard
and
prudently
carried
the
accused
back
to
gaol
the
mob
hooted
them
and
the
prisoners
indiscriminately
denys
saw
the
latter
safely
lodged
then
made
for
the
white
hart
where
he
expected
to
find
gerard
on
the
way
he
saw
two
girls
working
at
a
window
he
saluted
them
they
smiled
he
entered
into
conversation
their
manners
were
easy
their
complexion
high
he
invited
them
to
a
repast
at
the
white
they
objected
he
acquiesced
in
their
refusal
they
consented
and
in
this
charming
society
he
forgot
all
about
poor
gerard
who
meantime
was
carried
off
to
gaol
but
on
the
way
suddenly
stopped
having
now
somewhat
recovered
his
presence
of
mind
and
demanded
to
know
by
whose
authority
he
was
arrested
by
the
said
the
constable
the
alas
what
have
i
a
stranger
done
to
offend
a
for
this
charge
of

be
a

from

he
jacques
held
out
the
writ
in
both
hands
about
a
yard
and
a
half
from
gerard
eye
and
at
the
same
moment
the
large
constable
suddenly
pinned
him
both
officers
were
on
tenterhooks
lest
the
prisoner
should
grab
the
document
to
which
they
attached
a
superstitious
importance
but
the
poor
prisoner
had
no
such
thought
query
whether
he
would
have
touched
it
with
the
tongs
he
just
craned
out
his
neck
and
read
it
and
to
his
infinite
surprise
found
the
who
had
signed
the
writ
was
the
friendly
alderman
he
took
courage
and
assured
his
captor
there
was
some
error
but
finding
he
made
no
impression
demanded
to
be
taken
before
the
alderman
what
say
you
to
that
jacques
impossible
we
have
no
orders
to
take
him
before
his
worship
read
the
writ
nay
but
good
kind
fellows
what
harm
can
it
be
i
will
give
you
each
an
jacques
what
say
you
to
that
humph
i
say
we
have
no
orders
not
to
take
him
to
his
worship
read
the
writ
then
say
we
take
him
to
prison
round
by
his
it
was
agreed
they
got
the
money
and
bade
gerard
observe
they
were
doing
him
a
favour
he
saw
they
wanted
a
little
gratitude
as
well
as
much
silver
he
tried
to
satisfy
this
cupidity
but
it
stuck
in
his
throat
feigning
was
not
his
forte
he
entered
the
alderman
presence
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
and
begged
with
faltering
voice
to
know
what
he
had
done
to
offend
since
he
left
that
very
room
with
manon
and
denys
nought
that
i
know
of
said
the
alderman
on
the
writ
being
shown
him
he
told
gerard
he
had
signed
it
at
daybreak
i
get
old
and
my
memory
faileth
me
a
discussing
of
the
girl
i
quite
forgot
your
own
offence
but
i
remember
now
all
is
well
you
are
he
i
committed
for
sorcery
stay
ere
you
go
to
gaol
you
shall
hear
what
your
accuser
says
run
and
fetch
him
the
man
could
not
find
the
accuser
all
at
once
so
the
alderman
getting
impatient
told
gerard
the
main
charge
was
that
he
had
set
a
dead
body
a
burning
with
diabolical
fire
that
flamed
but
did
not
consume
and
if
true
young
man
i
sorry
for
thee
for
thou
wilt
assuredly
burn
with
fire
of
good
pine
logs
in
the
of
oh
sir
for
pity
sake
let
me
have
speech
with
his
reverence
the
the
alderman
advised
gerard
against
it
the
church
was
harder
upon
sorcerers
than
was
the
but
sir
i
am
innocent
said
gerard
between
snarling
and
whining
oh
if
you
think
you
are
innocent
officer
go
with
him
to
the
cure
but
see
he
you
not
innocent
quotha
they
found
the
cure
in
his
doublet
repairing
a
wheelbarrow
gerard
told
him
all
and
appealed
piteously
to
him
just
for
using
a
little
phosphorus
in
against
they
are
going
to
it
was
lucky
for
our
magician
that
he
had
already
told
his
tale
in
full
to
the
cure
for
thus
that
shrewd
personage
had
hold
of
the
stick
at
the
right
end
the
corporation
held
it
by
the
ferule
his
reverence
looked
exceedingly
grave
and
said
i
must
question
you
privately
on
this
untoward
he
took
him
into
a
private
room
and
bade
the
officer
stand
outside
and
guard
the
door
and
be
ready
to
come
if
called
the
big
constable
stood
outside
the
door
quaking
and
expecting
to
see
the
room
fly
away
and
leave
a
stink
of
brimstone
instantly
they
were
alone
the
cure
unlocked
his
countenance
and
was
himself
again
show
me
the
trick
o
said
he
all
curiosity
i
can
not
sir
unless
the
room
be
the
cure
speedily
closed
out
the
light
with
a
wooden
shutter
now
but
on
what
shall
i
put
it
said
gerard
here
is
no
dead
face
was
that
made
it
look
so
the
cure
groped
about
the
room
good
here
is
an
image
is
my
patron
heaven
forbid
that
were
pshaw
rub
off
not
ay
but
it
goes
against
me
to
take
such
liberty
with
a
saint
objected
the
sorcerer
fiddlestick
said
the
divine
to
be
sure
by
putting
it
on
his
holiness
will
show
your
reverence
it
is
no
satanic
mayhap
was
for
that
i
did
propose
said
the
cure
subtly
thus
encouraged
gerard
fired
the
eyes
and
nostrils
of
the
image
and
made
the
cure
jump
then
lighted
up
the
hair
in
patches
and
set
the
whole
face
shining
like
a
lady
shouted
the
cure
is
strange
and
small
my
wonder
that
they
took
you
for
a
magician
seeing
a
dead
face
thus
fired
now
come
thy
ways
with
me
he
put
on
his
grey
gown
and
great
hat
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
found
themselves
in
presence
of
the
alderman
by
his
side
poisoning
his
mind
stood
the
accuser
a
singular
figure
in
red
hose
and
red
shoes
a
black
gown
with
blue
bands
and
a
cocked
hat
after
saluting
the
alderman
the
cure
turned
to
this
personage
and
said
so
mangis
at
thy
work
again
babbling
away
honest
men
lives
come
your
worship
this
is
the
old
tale
two
of
a
trade
can
agree
here
is
mangis
who
professes
sorcery
and
would
sell
himself
to
satan
but
that
satan
is
not
so
weak
as
buy
what
he
can
have
gratis
this
mangis
who
would
be
a
sorcerer
but
is
only
a
quacksalver
accuses
of
magic
a
true
lad
who
did
but
use
in
a
secret
of
chemistry
to
me
and
all
but
he
is
no
churchman
to
dabble
in
such
mysteries
objected
the
alderman
he
is
more
churchman
than
layman
being
convent
bred
and
in
the
lesser
orders
said
the
ready
cure
therefore
sorcerer
withdraw
thy
plaint
without
more
words
that
i
will
not
your
reverence
replied
mangis
stoutly
a
sorcerer
i
am
but
a
white
one
not
a
black
one
i
make
no
pact
with
satan
but
on
the
contrary
still
battle
him
with
lawful
and
necessary
arts
i
profane
the
sacraments
as
do
the
black
sorcerers
nor
turn
myself
into
a
cat
and
go
sucking
infants
blood
nor
their
breath
nor
set
dead
men
o
fire
i
but
tell
the
peasants
when
their
cattle
and
their
hens
are
possessed
and
at
what
time
of
the
moon
to
plant
rye
and
what
days
in
each
month
are
lucky
for
wooing
of
women
and
selling
of
bullocks
and
so
forth
above
all
it
is
my
art
and
my
trade
to
detect
the
black
magicians
as
i
did
that
whole
tribe
of
them
who
were
burnt
at
dol
but
last
ay
mangis
and
what
is
the
upshot
of
that
famous
fire
thy
tongue
did
kindle
why
their
ashes
were
cast
to
the
ay
but
the
true
end
of
thy
comedy
is
this
the
parliament
of
dijon
hath
since
sifted
the
matter
and
found
they
were
no
sorcerers
but
good
and
peaceful
citizens
and
but
last
week
did
order
masses
to
be
said
for
their
souls
and
expiatory
farces
and
mysteries
to
be
played
for
them
in
seven
towns
of
burgundy
all
which
will
not
of
those
cinders
make
men
and
women
again
now
is
our
custom
in
this
land
when
we
have
slain
the
innocent
by
hearkening
false
knaves
like
thee
not
to
blame
our
credulous
ears
but
the
false
tongue
that
gulled
them
therefore
bethink
thee
that
at
a
word
from
me
to
my
lord
bishop
thou
wilt
smell
burning
pine
nearer
than
knave
smelt
it
and
lived
and
wilt
travel
on
a
smoky
cloud
to
him
whose
heart
thou
bearest
for
the
word
devil
in
the
latin
it
meaneth
accuser
and
whose
livery
thou
and
the
cure
pointed
at
mangis
with
his
staff
that
is
true
said
the
alderman
for
red
and
black
be
the
foul
fiendys
by
this
time
the
white
sorcerer
cheek
was
as
colourless
as
his
dress
was
fiery
indeed
the
contrast
amounted
to
pictorial
he
stammered
out
i
respect
holy
church
and
her
will
he
shall
fire
the
churchyard
and
all
in
it
for
me
i
do
withdraw
the
then
withdraw
thyself
said
the
the
moment
he
was
gone
the
cure
took
the
conversational
tone
and
told
the
alderman
courteously
that
the
accused
had
received
the
chemical
substance
from
holy
church
and
had
restored
it
her
by
giving
it
all
to
him
then
is
in
good
hands
was
the
reply
young
man
you
are
free
let
me
have
your
reverence
doubt
it
not
humph
the
town
owes
me
four
silver
franks
this
three
months
and
they
shall
be
paid
cure
ay
ere
the
week
be
on
this
good
understanding
church
and
state
parted
as
soon
as
he
was
in
the
street
gerard
caught
the
priest
hand
and
kissed
it
oh
sir
oh
your
reverence
you
have
saved
me
from
the
fiery
stake
what
can
i
say
what
do
what
nought
foolish
lad
bounty
rewards
itself
natheless
humph
i
wish
i
had
without
leasing
it
ill
becomes
my
function
to
utter
falsehood
sir
gerard
was
mystified
didst
not
hear
me
say
thou
hadst
given
me
that
same
phosphorus
cost
me
a
fortnight
penance
that
light
the
cure
sighed
and
his
eye
twinkled
cunningly
nay
nay
cried
gerard
eagerly
now
heaven
forbid
that
was
no
falsehood
father
well
you
knew
the
phosphorus
was
yours
is
and
he
thrust
the
bottle
into
the
cure
hand
but
alas
is
too
poor
a
gift
will
you
not
take
from
my
purse
somewhat
for
holy
church
and
now
he
held
out
his
purse
with
glistening
eyes
nay
said
the
other
brusquely
and
put
his
hands
quickly
behind
him
not
a
doit
fie
fie
art
pauper
et
exul
come
thou
rather
each
day
at
noon
and
take
thy
diet
with
me
for
my
heart
warms
to
thee
and
he
went
off
very
abruptly
with
his
hands
behind
him
they
itched
but
they
itched
in
vain
where
there
a
heart
there
a
rubicon
gerard
went
hastily
to
the
inn
to
relieve
denys
of
the
anxiety
so
long
and
mysterious
an
absence
must
have
caused
him
he
found
him
seated
at
his
ease
playing
dice
with
two
young
ladies
whose
manners
were
unreserved
and
complexion
high
gerard
was
hurt
point
la
jeanneton
said
he
colouring
up
what
of
her
said
denys
gaily
rattling
the
dice
she
said
peu
que
sont
les
femmes
oh
did
she
and
what
say
you
to
that
mesdemoiselles
we
say
that
none
run
women
down
but
such
as
are
too
old
or
too
or
too
witless
to
please
witless
quotha
wise
men
have
not
folly
enough
to
please
them
nor
madness
enough
to
desire
to
please
them
said
gerard
loftily
but
is
to
my
comrade
i
speak
not
to
you
you
brazen
toads
that
make
so
free
with
a
man
at
first
preach
away
comrade
fling
a
byword
or
two
at
our
heads
know
girls
that
he
is
a
very
solomon
for
bywords
methinks
he
was
brought
up
by
hand
on
be
thy
friendship
a
byword
retorted
gerard
the
friendship
that
melts
to
nought
at
sight
of
a
malheureux
cried
denys
i
speak
but
pellets
and
thou
answerest
would
i
could
was
the
reply
what
a
little
savage
said
one
of
the
girls
gerard
opened
the
door
and
put
in
his
head
i
have
thought
of
a
byword
said
he
spitefully
qui
hante
femmes
et
dez
il
mourra
en
pauvretez
and
having
delivered
this
thunderbolt
of
antique
wisdom
he
slammed
the
door
viciously
ere
any
of
them
could
retort
and
now
being
somewhat
exhausted
by
his
anxieties
he
went
to
the
bar
for
a
morsel
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
wine
the
landlord
would
sell
nothing
less
than
a
pint
bottle
well
then
he
would
have
a
bottle
but
when
he
came
to
compare
the
contents
of
the
bottle
with
its
size
great
was
the
discrepancy
on
this
he
examined
the
bottle
keenly
and
found
that
the
glass
was
thin
where
the
bottle
tapered
but
towards
the
bottom
unnaturally
thick
he
pointed
this
out
at
once
the
landlord
answered
superciliously
that
he
did
not
make
bottles
and
was
nowise
accountable
for
their
shape
that
we
will
see
presently
said
gerard
i
will
take
this
thy
pint
to
the
nay
nay
for
heaven
sake
cried
the
landlord
changing
his
tone
at
once
i
love
to
content
my
customers
if
by
chance
this
pint
be
short
we
will
charge
it
and
its
fellow
three
sous
insteads
of
two
sous
so
be
it
but
much
i
admire
that
you
the
host
of
so
fair
an
inn
should
practise
thus
the
wine
too
smacketh
strongly
of
spring
young
sir
said
the
landlord
we
cut
no
travellers
throats
at
this
inn
as
they
do
at
most
however
you
know
all
about
that
white
hart
is
no
lion
nor
bear
whatever
masterful
robbery
is
done
here
is
done
upon
the
poor
host
how
then
could
he
live
at
all
if
he
dealt
not
a
little
crooked
with
the
few
who
pay
gerard
objected
to
this
system
root
and
branch
honest
trade
was
small
profits
quick
returns
and
neither
to
cheat
nor
be
cheated
the
landlord
sighed
at
this
picture
so
might
one
keep
an
inn
in
heaven
but
not
in
burgundy
when
foot
soldiers
going
to
the
wars
are
quartered
on
me
how
can
i
but
lose
by
their
custom
two
sous
per
day
is
their
pay
and
they
eat
two
sous
worth
and
drink
into
the
bargain
the
pardoners
are
my
good
friends
but
palmers
and
pilgrims
what
think
you
i
gain
by
them
marry
a
loss
minstrels
and
jongleurs
draw
custom
and
so
claim
to
pay
no
score
except
for
liquor
by
the
secular
monks
i
neither
gain
nor
lose
but
the
black
and
grey
friars
have
made
vow
of
poverty
but
not
of
famine
eat
like
wolves
and
give
the
poor
host
nought
but
their
prayers
and
mayhap
not
them
how
can
he
tell
in
my
father
day
we
had
the
weddings
but
now
the
great
gentry
let
their
houses
and
their
plates
their
mugs
and
their
spoons
to
any
honest
couple
that
want
to
wed
and
thither
the
very
mechanics
go
with
their
brides
and
bridal
train
they
come
not
to
us
indeed
we
could
not
find
seats
and
vessels
for
such
a
crowd
as
eat
and
drink
and
dance
the
week
out
at
the
homeliest
wedding
now
in
my
father
day
the
great
gentry
sold
wine
by
the
barrel
only
but
now
they
have
leave
to
cry
it
and
sell
it
by
the
galopin
in
the
very
how
can
we
vie
with
them
they
grow
it
we
buy
it
of
the
grower
the
coroner
quests
we
have
still
and
these
would
bring
goodly
profit
but
the
meat
is
aye
gone
ere
the
mouths
be
you
should
make
better
provision
suggested
his
hearer
the
law
will
not
let
us
we
are
forbidden
to
go
into
the
market
for
the
first
hour
so
when
we
arrive
the
burghers
have
bought
all
but
the
refuse
besides
the
law
forbids
us
to
buy
more
than
three
bushels
of
meal
at
a
time
yet
market
day
comes
but
once
a
week
as
for
the
butchers
they
will
not
kill
for
us
unless
we
bribe
courage
said
gerard
kindly
the
shoe
pinches
every
trader
ay
but
not
as
it
pinches
us
our
shoe
is
trode
all
o
one
side
as
well
as
pinches
us
lame
a
savoir
if
we
pay
not
the
merchants
we
buy
meal
meat
and
wine
of
they
can
cast
us
into
prison
and
keep
us
there
till
we
pay
or
die
but
we
can
not
cast
into
prison
those
who
buy
those
very
victuals
of
us
a
traveller
horse
we
may
keep
for
his
debt
but
where
in
heaven
name
in
our
own
stable
eating
his
head
off
at
our
cost
nay
we
may
keep
the
traveller
himself
but
where
in
gaol
nay
in
our
own
good
house
and
there
must
we
lodge
and
feed
him
gratis
and
so
fling
good
silver
after
bad
merci
no
let
him
go
with
a
wanion
our
honestest
customers
are
the
thieves
would
to
heaven
there
were
more
of
them
they
look
not
too
close
into
the
shape
of
the
canakin
nor
into
the
host
reckoning
with
them
and
with
their
purses
is
lightly
come
and
lightly
go
also
they
spend
freely
not
knowing
but
each
carouse
may
be
their
last
but
the
instead
of
profiting
by
this
fair
example
are
for
ever
robbing
the
poor
host
when
noble
or
honest
travellers
descend
at
our
door
come
the
provost
men
pretending
to
suspect
them
and
demanding
to
search
them
and
their
papers
to
save
which
offence
the
host
must
bleed
wine
and
meat
then
come
the
excise
to
examine
all
your
weights
and
measures
you
must
stop
their
mouths
with
meat
and
wine
town
excise
royal
excise
parliament
excise
a
swarm
of
them
and
all
with
a
wolf
in
their
stomachs
and
a
sponge
in
their
gullets
monks
friars
pilgrims
palmers
soldiers
excisemen
and
men
and
mere
bad
debtors
how
can
white
butt
against
all
these
cutting
no
throats
in
as
do
your
and
and
heads
and
lions
and
your
and
how
can
white
hart
give
a
pint
of
wine
for
a
pint
and
everything
risen
so
why
lad
not
a
pound
of
bread
i
sell
but
cost
me
three
good
copper
deniers
twelve
to
the
sou
and
each
pint
of
wine
bought
by
the
tun
costs
me
four
deniers
every
sack
of
charcoal
two
sous
and
gone
in
a
day
a
pair
of
partridges
five
sous
what
think
you
of
that
heard
one
ever
the
like
five
sous
for
two
little
beasts
all
bone
and
feather
a
pair
of
pigeons
thirty
deniers
is
ruination
for
we
may
not
raise
our
pricen
with
the
market
oh
no
i
tell
thee
the
shoe
is
trode
all
o
one
side
as
well
as
pinches
the
water
into
our
eyn
we
may
charge
nought
for
mustard
pepper
salt
or
firewood
think
you
we
get
them
for
nought
candle
it
is
a
sou
the
pound
salt
five
sous
the
stone
pepper
four
sous
the
pound
mustard
twenty
deniers
the
pint
and
raw
meat
dwindleth
it
on
the
spit
with
no
cost
to
me
but
loss
of
weight
why
what
think
you
i
pay
my
cook
but
you
shall
never
guess
a
hundred
sous
a
year
as
i
am
a
living
sinner
and
my
waiter
thirty
sous
besides
his
perquisites
he
is
a
hantle
richer
than
i
am
and
then
to
be
insulted
as
well
as
pillaged
last
sunday
i
went
to
church
it
is
a
place
i
trouble
not
often
did
the
cure
lash
the
i
grant
you
he
hit
all
the
trades
except
the
one
that
is
a
byword
for
looseness
and
pride
and
sloth
to
wit
the
clergy
but
mind
you
he
stripeit
the
other
lay
estates
with
a
feather
but
us
with
a
neat
pizzle
godless
for
this
godless
for
that
and
most
godless
of
all
for
opening
our
doors
during
mass
why
the
law
forces
us
to
open
at
all
hours
to
travellers
from
another
town
stopping
halting
or
passing
those
be
the
words
they
can
fine
us
before
the
bailiff
if
we
refuse
them
mass
or
no
mass
and
say
a
townsman
should
creep
in
with
the
true
travellers
are
we
to
blame
they
all
vow
they
are
tired
wayfarers
and
can
i
ken
every
face
in
a
great
town
like
this
so
if
we
respect
the
law
our
poor
souls
are
to
suffer
and
if
we
respect
it
not
our
poor
lank
purses
must
bleed
at
two
holes
fine
and
loss
of
a
man
speaking
of
himself
in
general
is
a
babbling
brook
of
his
wrongs
a
shining
labitur
et
labetur
in
omne
volubilis
so
luckily
for
my
readers
though
not
for
all
concerned
this
injured
orator
was
arrested
in
mid
career
another
man
burst
in
upon
his
wrongs
with
all
the
advantage
of
a
recent
wrong
a
wrong
red
hot
it
was
denys
cursing
and
swearing
and
crying
that
he
was
robbed
did
those
hussies
pass
this
way
who
are
they
where
do
they
bide
they
have
my
purse
and
fifteen
golden
pieces
raise
the
hue
and
cry
ah
traitresses
vipers
these
inns
are
all
there
now
cried
the
landlord
to
gerard
gerard
implored
him
to
be
calm
and
say
how
it
had
befallen
first
one
went
out
on
some
pretence
then
after
a
while
the
other
went
to
fetch
her
back
and
neither
returning
i
clapped
hand
to
purse
and
found
it
empty
the
ungrateful
creatures
i
was
letting
them
win
it
in
a
gallop
but
loaded
dice
were
not
quick
enough
they
must
claw
it
all
in
a
gerard
was
for
going
at
once
to
the
alderman
and
setting
the
officers
to
find
them
not
i
said
denys
i
hate
the
law
no
as
it
came
so
let
it
gerard
would
not
give
it
up
so
at
a
hint
from
the
landlord
he
forced
denys
along
with
him
to
the
that
dignitary
shook
his
head
we
have
no
clue
to
occasional
thieves
that
work
honestly
at
their
needles
till
some
gull
comes
and
tempts
them
with
an
easy
booty
and
then
they
pluck
him
come
away
cried
denys
furiously
i
knew
what
use
a
bourgeois
would
be
to
me
at
a
pinch
and
he
marched
off
in
a
rage
they
are
clear
of
the
town
ere
this
said
gerard
speak
no
more
o
if
you
prize
my
friendship
i
have
five
pieces
with
the
bailiff
and
ten
i
left
with
manon
luckily
or
these
traitresses
had
feathered
their
nest
with
my
last
plume
what
dost
gape
for
so
nay
i
do
ill
to
vent
my
choler
on
thee
i
tell
thee
all
art
wiser
than
i
what
saidst
thou
at
the
door
no
matter
well
then
i
did
offer
marriage
to
that
gerard
was
dumfounded
what
you
offered
her
what
marriage
is
that
such
a
mighty
strange
thing
to
offer
a
wench
is
a
strange
thing
to
offer
to
a
strange
girl
in
nay
i
am
not
such
a
sot
as
you
opine
i
saw
the
corn
in
all
that
chaff
i
knew
i
could
not
get
her
by
fair
means
so
i
was
fain
to
try
foul
said
i
is
not
one
of
my
habits
but
struck
by
your
qualities
i
make
an
exception
deign
to
bestow
this
hand
on
me
and
she
bestowed
it
on
thine
ear
not
so
on
the
contrary
she
art
a
disrespectful
young
monkey
know
that
here
not
being
holland
or
any
other
barbarous
state
courtesy
begets
courtesy
says
she
a
colouring
like
a
rose
you
are
too
late
he
is
not
a
patch
on
you
for
looks
but
then
he
has
loved
me
a
long
time
who
other
why
he
that
was
not
too
late
oh
that
is
the
way
they
all
speak
the
loves
the
their
little
minds
go
in
leaps
think
you
they
marshal
their
words
in
order
of
battle
their
tongues
are
in
too
great
a
hurry
says
she
love
him
not
not
to
say
love
him
but
he
does
me
and
dearly
and
for
that
reason
i
sooner
die
than
cause
him
grief
i
would
now
i
believe
she
did
love
who
doubts
that
why
she
said
so
round
about
as
they
always
say
these
things
and
with
for
well
one
thing
led
to
another
and
at
last
as
she
could
not
give
me
her
hand
she
gave
me
a
piece
of
advice
and
that
was
to
leave
part
of
my
money
with
the
young
mistress
then
when
bad
company
had
cleaned
me
out
i
should
have
some
to
travel
back
with
said
she
i
said
i
would
better
her
advice
and
leave
it
with
her
her
face
got
red
says
she
what
you
do
chambermaids
have
an
ill
name
for
honesty
the
devil
is
not
so
black
as
he
is
painted
said
i
risk
it
and
i
left
fifteen
gold
pieces
with
gerard
sighed
i
wish
you
may
ever
see
them
again
it
is
wondrous
in
what
esteem
you
do
hold
this
sex
to
trust
so
to
the
first
comer
for
my
part
i
know
little
about
them
i
never
saw
but
one
i
could
love
as
well
as
i
love
thee
but
the
ancients
must
surely
know
and
they
held
women
cheap
quid
femina
said
they
which
is
but
la
tune
in
latin
peu
que
sont
les
femmes
also
do
but
see
how
the
greybeards
of
our
own
day
speak
of
them
being
no
longer
blinded
by
desire
this
alderman
to
oh
novice
of
novices
cried
denys
not
to
have
seen
why
that
old
fool
rails
so
on
the
poor
things
one
day
out
of
the
millions
of
women
he
blackens
one
did
prefer
some
other
man
to
him
for
which
solitary
piece
of
bad
taste
and
ten
to
one
was
good
taste
he
doth
bespatter
creation
fairer
half
thereby
proving
what
le
peu
que
sont
les
i
see
women
have
a
shrewd
champion
in
thee
said
gerard
with
a
smile
but
the
next
moment
inquired
gravely
why
he
had
not
told
him
all
this
before
denys
grinned
had
the
girl
said
why
then
i
had
told
thee
straight
but
is
a
rule
with
us
soldiers
never
to
publish
our
defeats
much
if
after
each
check
we
claim
not
a
now
that
is
true
said
gerard
young
as
i
am
i
have
seen
this
that
after
every
great
battle
the
generals
on
both
sides
go
to
the
nearest
church
and
sing
each
a
te
deum
for
the
victory
methinks
a
te
martem
or
te
bellonam
or
te
mercurium
mercury
being
the
god
of
lies
were
more
pas
si
bete
said
denys
approvingly
hast
a
good
eye
canst
see
a
steeple
by
daylight
so
now
tell
me
how
thou
hast
fared
in
this
town
all
come
said
gerard
is
well
thou
hast
asked
me
for
else
i
had
never
told
he
then
related
in
full
how
he
had
been
arrested
and
by
what
a
providential
circumstance
he
had
escaped
long
imprisonment
or
speedy
conflagration
his
narrative
produced
an
effect
he
little
expected
or
desired
i
am
a
traitor
cried
denys
i
left
thee
in
a
strange
place
to
fight
thine
own
battles
while
i
shook
the
dice
with
those
jades
now
take
thou
this
sword
and
pass
it
through
my
body
what
for
in
heaven
name
inquired
gerard
for
an
example
roared
denys
for
a
warning
to
all
false
loons
that
profess
friendship
and
disgrace
oh
very
well
said
gerard
yes
not
a
bad
notion
where
will
you
have
it
here
through
my
heart
that
is
where
other
men
have
a
heart
but
i
none
or
a
satanic
false
gerard
made
a
motion
to
run
him
through
and
flung
his
arms
round
his
neck
instead
i
know
no
way
to
thy
heart
but
this
thou
great
silly
denys
uttered
an
exclamation
then
hugged
him
warmly
and
quite
overcome
by
this
sudden
turn
of
youthful
affection
and
native
grace
gulped
out
in
a
broken
voice
railest
on
women
and
art
like
them
with
thy
pretty
ways
thy
mother
milk
is
in
thee
still
satan
would
love
thee
or
le
bon
dieu
would
kick
him
out
of
hell
for
shaming
it
give
me
thy
hand
give
me
thy
hand
may
a
tremendous
oath
if
i
let
thee
out
of
my
sight
till
and
so
the
staunch
friends
were
more
than
reconciled
after
their
short
tiff
the
next
day
the
thieves
were
tried
the
pieces
de
conviction
were
reduced
in
number
to
the
great
chagrin
of
the
little
clerk
by
the
interment
of
the
bones
but
there
was
still
a
pretty
show
a
hand
struck
off
flagrante
delicto
a
murdered
woman
hair
the
axe
and
other
tools
of
crime
the
skulls
were
sworn
to
by
the
constables
who
had
found
them
evidence
was
lax
in
that
age
and
place
they
all
confessed
but
the
landlord
and
manon
was
called
to
bring
the
crime
home
to
him
her
evidence
was
conclusive
he
made
a
vain
attempt
to
shake
her
credibility
by
drawing
from
her
that
her
own
sweetheart
had
been
one
of
the
gang
and
that
she
had
held
her
tongue
so
long
as
he
was
alive
the
public
prosecutor
came
to
the
aid
of
his
witness
and
elicited
that
a
knife
had
been
held
to
her
throat
and
her
own
sweetheart
sworn
with
solemn
oaths
to
kill
her
should
she
betray
them
and
that
this
terrible
threat
and
not
the
mere
fear
of
death
had
glued
her
lips
the
other
thieves
were
condemned
to
be
hanged
and
the
landlord
to
be
broken
on
the
wheel
he
uttered
a
piercing
cry
when
his
sentence
was
pronounced
as
for
poor
manon
she
became
the
subject
of
universal
criticism
nor
did
opinion
any
longer
run
dead
in
her
favour
it
divided
into
two
broad
currents
and
strange
to
relate
the
majority
of
her
own
sex
took
her
part
and
the
males
were
but
equally
divided
which
hardly
happens
once
in
a
hundred
years
perhaps
some
lady
will
explain
the
phenomenon
as
for
me
i
am
a
little
shy
of
explaining
things
i
do
understand
it
has
become
so
common
meantime
had
she
been
a
lover
of
notoriety
she
would
have
been
happy
for
the
town
talked
of
nothing
but
her
the
poor
girl
however
had
but
one
wish
to
escape
the
crowd
that
followed
her
and
hide
her
head
somewhere
where
she
could
cry
over
her
pendard
whom
all
these
proceedings
brought
vividly
back
to
her
affectionate
remembrance
before
he
was
hanged
he
had
threatened
her
life
but
she
was
not
one
of
your
fastidious
girls
who
love
their
male
divinities
any
the
less
for
beating
them
kicking
them
or
killing
them
but
rather
the
better
provided
these
attentions
are
interspersed
with
occasional
caresses
so
it
would
have
been
odd
indeed
had
she
taken
offence
at
a
mere
threat
of
that
sort
he
had
never
threatened
her
with
a
rival
she
sobbed
meantime
the
inn
was
filled
with
thirsters
for
a
sight
of
her
who
feasted
and
drank
to
pass
away
the
time
till
she
should
deign
to
appear
when
she
had
been
sobbing
some
time
there
was
a
tap
at
her
door
and
the
landlord
entered
with
a
proposal
nay
weep
not
good
lass
your
fortune
it
is
made
an
you
like
say
the
word
and
you
are
chambermaid
of
white
hart
nay
nay
said
manon
with
a
fresh
burst
of
grief
never
more
will
i
be
a
servant
in
an
inn
i
go
to
my
the
landlord
consoled
and
coaxed
her
and
she
became
calmer
but
none
the
less
determined
against
his
proposal
the
landlord
left
her
but
ere
long
he
returned
and
made
her
another
proposal
would
she
be
his
wife
and
landlady
of
the
white
hart
you
do
ill
to
mock
me
said
she
sorrowfully
nay
sweetheart
i
mock
thee
not
i
am
too
old
for
sorry
jests
say
you
the
word
and
you
are
my
partner
for
better
for
she
looked
at
him
and
saw
he
was
in
earnest
on
this
she
suddenly
rained
hard
to
the
memory
of
le
pendard
the
tears
came
in
a
torrent
being
the
last
and
she
gave
her
hand
to
the
landlord
of
the
white
hart
and
broke
a
gold
crown
with
him
in
sign
of
plighted
troth
we
will
keep
it
dark
till
the
house
is
quiet
said
the
landlord
ay
said
she
but
meantime
prithee
give
me
linen
to
hem
or
work
to
do
for
the
time
hangs
on
me
like
her
betrothed
eye
brightened
at
this
housewifely
request
and
he
brought
her
up
two
dozen
flagons
of
various
sizes
to
clean
and
polish
she
gathered
complacency
as
she
reflected
that
by
a
strange
turn
of
fortune
all
this
bright
pewter
was
to
be
hers
meantime
the
landlord
went
downstairs
and
falling
in
with
our
friends
drew
them
aside
into
the
bar
he
then
addressed
denys
with
considerable
solemnity
we
are
old
acquaintances
and
you
want
not
for
sagacity
now
advise
me
in
a
strait
my
custom
is
somewhat
declining
this
girl
manon
is
the
talk
of
the
town
see
how
full
the
inn
is
she
doth
refuse
to
be
my
chambermaid
i
have
half
a
mind
to
marry
her
what
think
you
shall
i
say
the
word
denys
in
reply
merely
open
his
eyes
wide
with
amazement
the
landlord
turned
to
gerard
with
a
look
nay
sir
said
gerard
i
am
too
young
to
advise
my
seniors
and
no
matter
let
us
hear
your
well
sir
it
was
said
of
a
good
wife
by
the
ancients
quae
latuit
bene
vixit
that
is
she
is
the
best
wife
that
is
least
talked
of
but
here
quae
patuit
were
as
near
the
mark
therefore
an
you
bear
the
lass
why
not
club
purses
with
denys
and
me
and
convey
her
safe
home
with
a
dowry
then
mayhap
some
rustical
person
in
her
own
place
may
be
brought
to
wife
why
so
many
words
said
denys
this
old
fox
is
not
the
ass
he
affects
to
oh
that
is
your
advice
is
it
said
the
landlord
testily
well
then
we
shall
soon
know
who
is
the
fool
you
or
me
for
i
have
spoken
to
her
as
it
happens
and
what
is
more
she
has
said
ay
and
she
is
polishing
the
flagons
at
this
oho
said
denys
drily
was
an
ambuscade
well
in
that
case
my
advice
is
run
for
the
notary
tie
the
noose
and
let
us
three
drink
the
bride
health
till
we
see
six
sots
and
shall
ay
now
you
utter
in
ten
minutes
a
civil
marriage
was
effected
upstairs
before
a
notary
and
his
clerk
and
our
two
friends
in
ten
minutes
more
the
white
hind
dead
sick
of
seclusion
had
taken
her
place
within
the
bar
and
was
serving
out
liquids
and
bustling
and
her
colour
rising
a
little
in
six
little
minutes
more
she
soundly
rated
a
careless
for
carrying
a
nipperkin
of
wine
awry
and
spilling
good
liquor
during
the
evening
she
received
across
the
bar
eight
offers
of
marriage
some
of
them
from
respectable
burghers
now
the
landlord
and
our
two
friends
had
in
perfect
innocence
ensconced
themselves
behind
a
screen
to
drink
at
their
ease
the
new
couple
health
the
above
comedy
was
thrown
in
for
their
entertainment
by
bounteous
fate
they
heard
the
proposals
made
one
after
another
and
uninventive
manon
invariable
answer
serviteur
you
are
a
day
after
the
the
landlord
chuckled
and
looked
superiority
at
both
his
late
advisers
with
their
traditional
notions
that
men
shun
a
woman
quae
patuit
who
has
become
the
town
talk
but
denys
scarce
noticed
the
spouse
triumph
over
him
he
was
so
occupied
with
his
own
over
gerard
at
each
municipal
tender
of
undying
affection
he
turned
almost
purple
with
the
effort
it
cost
him
not
to
roar
with
glee
and
driving
his
elbow
into
the
and
pupil
of
antiquity
whispered
le
peu
que
sont
les
the
next
morning
gerard
was
eager
to
start
but
denys
was
under
a
vow
to
see
the
murderers
of
the
girl
executed
gerard
respected
his
vow
but
avoided
his
example
he
went
to
bid
the
cure
farewell
instead
and
sought
and
received
his
blessing
about
noon
the
travellers
got
clear
of
the
town
just
outside
the
south
gate
they
passed
the
gallows
it
had
eight
tenants
the
skeleton
of
manon
late
wept
and
now
being
fast
forgotten
lover
and
the
bodies
of
those
who
had
so
nearly
taken
our
travellers
lives
a
hand
was
nailed
to
the
beam
and
hard
by
on
a
huge
wheel
was
clawed
the
dead
landlord
with
every
bone
in
his
body
broken
to
pieces
gerard
averted
his
head
and
hurried
by
denys
lingered
and
crowed
over
his
dead
foes
times
are
changed
my
lads
since
we
two
sat
shaking
in
the
cold
awaiting
you
seven
to
come
and
cut
our
fie
denys
death
squares
all
reckonings
prithee
pass
on
without
another
word
if
you
prize
my
respect
a
to
this
earnest
remonstrance
denys
yielded
he
even
said
thoughtfully
you
have
been
better
brought
up
than
about
three
in
the
afternoon
they
reached
a
little
town
with
the
people
buzzing
in
knots
the
wolves
starved
by
the
cold
had
entered
and
eaten
two
persons
overnight
in
the
main
street
so
some
were
blaming
the
eaten
none
but
fools
or
knaves
are
about
after
nightfall
others
the
law
for
not
protecting
the
town
and
others
the
corporation
for
not
enforcing
what
laws
there
were
bah
this
is
nothing
to
us
said
denys
and
was
for
resuming
their
march
ay
but
is
remonstrated
gerard
what
are
we
the
pair
they
ate
no
but
we
may
be
the
next
ay
neighbour
said
an
ancient
man
is
the
town
fault
for
not
obeying
the
ducal
ordinance
which
bids
every
shopkeeper
light
a
lamp
his
door
at
sunset
and
burn
it
till
on
this
denys
asked
him
somewhat
derisively
what
made
him
fancy
rush
dips
would
scare
away
empty
wolves
why
mutton
fat
is
all
their
is
not
the
fat
vain
man
but
the
light
all
ill
things
hate
light
especially
wolves
and
the
imps
that
lurk
i
ween
under
their
fur
example
paris
city
stands
in
a
wood
like
and
the
wolves
do
howl
around
it
all
night
yet
of
late
years
wolves
come
but
little
in
the
streets
for
why
in
that
burgh
the
watchmen
do
thunder
at
each
door
that
is
dark
and
make
the
weary
wight
rise
and
light
is
my
son
tells
me
he
is
a
great
voyager
my
son
in
further
explanation
he
assured
them
that
previously
to
that
ordinance
no
city
had
been
worse
infested
with
wolves
than
paris
a
troop
had
boldly
assaulted
the
town
in
and
in
they
had
eaten
fourteen
persons
in
a
single
month
between
montmartre
and
the
gate
antoine
and
that
not
a
winter
month
even
but
september
and
as
for
the
dead
which
nightly
lay
in
the
streets
slain
in
midnight
brawls
or
assassinated
the
wolves
had
used
to
devour
them
and
to
grub
up
the
fresh
graves
in
the
churchyards
and
tear
out
the
bodies
here
a
thoughtful
citizen
suggested
that
probably
the
wolves
had
been
bridled
of
late
in
paris
not
by
but
owing
to
the
english
having
been
driven
out
of
the
kingdom
of
france
for
those
english
be
very
wolves
themselves
for
fierceness
and
greediness
what
marvel
then
that
under
their
rule
our
neighbours
of
france
should
be
this
logic
was
too
suited
to
the
time
and
place
not
to
be
received
with
acclamation
but
the
old
man
stood
his
ground
i
grant
ye
those
islanders
are
wolves
but
ones
and
little
apt
to
favour
their
cousins
one
greedy
thing
loveth
it
another
i
trow
not
by
the
same
token
and
this
too
i
have
from
my
boy
nicole
sir
wolf
dare
not
show
his
nose
in
london
city
though
is
smaller
than
paris
and
thick
woods
hard
by
the
north
wall
and
therein
great
store
of
deer
and
wild
boars
as
rife
as
flies
at
sir
said
gerard
you
seem
conversant
with
wild
beasts
prithee
advise
my
comrade
here
and
me
we
would
not
waste
time
on
the
road
an
if
we
may
go
forward
to
the
next
town
with
reasonable
safety
young
man
i
trow
an
idle
risk
it
lacks
but
an
hour
of
dusk
and
you
must
pass
nigh
a
wood
where
lurk
some
thousands
of
these
vermin
rank
cowards
single
but
in
great
bands
bold
as
lions
wherefore
i
rede
you
sojourn
here
the
night
and
journey
on
betimes
by
the
dawn
the
vermin
will
be
tired
out
with
roaring
and
rampaging
and
mayhap
will
have
filled
their
lank
bellies
with
flesh
of
my
good
neighbours
here
the
unteachable
gerard
hoped
not
and
asked
could
he
recommend
them
to
a
good
inn
humph
there
is
the
my
grandaughter
keeps
it
she
is
a
mijauree
but
not
so
knavish
as
most
and
her
house
indifferent
hey
for
the
struck
in
denys
decided
by
his
ineradicable
foible
on
the
way
to
it
gerard
inquired
of
his
companion
what
a
mijauree
was
denys
laughed
at
his
ignorance
not
know
what
a
mijauree
is
why
all
the
world
knows
that
it
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
as
they
entered
the
tete
they
met
a
young
lady
richly
dressed
with
a
velvet
chaperon
on
her
head
which
was
confined
by
law
to
the
nobility
they
unbonneted
and
louted
low
and
she
curtsied
but
fixed
her
eye
on
vacancy
the
while
which
had
a
curious
rather
than
a
genial
effect
however
nobility
was
not
so
unassuming
in
those
days
as
it
is
now
so
they
were
little
surprised
but
the
next
minute
supper
was
served
and
lo
in
came
this
princess
and
carved
the
goose
holy
bavon
cried
gerard
was
the
landlady
all
the
a
young
woman
cursed
with
nice
white
teeth
and
lovely
hands
for
these
beauties
being
misallied
to
homely
features
had
turned
her
head
she
was
a
feeble
carver
carving
not
for
the
sake
of
others
but
herself
to
display
her
hands
when
not
carving
she
was
eternally
either
taking
a
pin
out
of
her
head
or
her
body
or
else
putting
a
pin
into
her
head
or
her
body
to
display
her
teeth
she
laughed
indifferently
at
gay
or
grave
and
from
ear
to
ear
and
she
sat
at
ease
with
her
mouth
ajar
now
there
is
an
animal
in
creation
of
no
great
general
merit
but
it
has
the
eye
of
a
hawk
for
affectation
it
is
called
a
and
gerard
was
but
a
boy
still
in
some
things
swift
to
see
and
to
loath
affectation
so
denys
sat
casting
sheep
eyes
and
gerard
daggers
at
one
comedian
presently
in
the
midst
of
her
minauderies
she
gave
a
loud
shriek
and
bounded
out
of
her
chair
like
hare
from
form
and
ran
backwards
out
of
the
room
uttering
little
screams
and
holding
her
farthingale
tight
down
to
her
ankles
with
both
hands
and
as
she
scuttled
out
of
the
door
a
mouse
scuttled
back
to
the
wainscot
in
a
state
of
equal
and
perhaps
more
reasonable
terror
the
guests
who
had
risen
in
anxiety
at
the
principal
yell
now
stood
irresolute
awhile
then
sat
down
laughing
the
tender
denys
to
whom
a
woman
cowardice
being
a
sexual
trait
seemed
to
be
a
lovely
and
pleasant
thing
said
he
would
go
comfort
her
and
bring
her
back
nay
nay
nay
for
pity
sake
let
her
bide
cried
gerard
earnestly
oh
blessed
mouse
sure
some
saint
sent
thee
to
our
now
at
his
right
hand
sat
a
sturdy
burgher
whose
conduct
up
to
date
had
been
cynical
he
had
never
budged
nor
even
rested
his
knife
at
all
this
fracas
he
now
turned
on
gerard
and
inquired
haughtily
whether
he
really
thought
that
grimaciere
was
afraid
of
a
mouse
ay
she
screamed
where
is
the
coquette
that
can
not
scream
to
the
life
these
she
do
still
ape
the
nobles
some
princess
or
duchess
hath
lain
here
a
night
that
was
honestly
afeard
of
a
mouse
having
been
brought
up
to
it
and
this
ape
hath
seen
her
and
said
will
start
at
a
mouse
and
make
a
coil
she
has
no
more
right
to
start
at
a
mouse
than
to
wear
that
fur
on
her
bosom
and
that
velvet
on
her
head
i
am
of
the
town
young
man
and
have
known
the
mijauree
all
her
life
and
i
mind
when
she
was
no
more
afeard
of
a
mouse
than
she
is
of
a
he
added
that
she
was
fast
emptying
the
inn
with
these
all
the
world
is
so
sick
of
her
hands
that
her
very
kinsfolk
will
not
venture
themselves
anigh
he
concluded
with
something
like
a
sigh
the
was
a
thriving
hostelry
under
my
old
chum
her
good
father
but
she
is
digging
its
grave
tooth
and
nail
tooth
and
nail
good
a
right
merry
conceit
and
a
true
said
gerard
but
the
right
merry
conceit
was
an
inadvertence
as
pure
as
snow
and
the
stout
burgher
went
to
his
grave
and
never
knew
what
he
had
done
for
just
then
attention
was
attracted
by
denys
returning
pompously
he
inspected
the
apartment
minutely
and
with
a
high
official
air
he
also
looked
solemnly
under
the
table
and
during
the
whole
inquisition
a
white
hand
was
placed
conspicuously
on
the
edge
of
the
open
door
and
a
tremulous
voice
inquired
behind
it
whether
the
horrid
thing
was
quite
gone
the
enemy
has
retreated
bag
and
baggage
said
denys
and
handed
in
the
trembling
fair
who
sitting
down
apologized
to
her
guests
for
her
foolish
fears
with
so
much
earnestness
grace
and
seeming
that
but
for
a
sour
grin
on
his
neighbour
face
gerard
would
have
been
taken
in
as
all
the
other
strangers
were
dinner
ended
the
young
landlady
begged
an
augustine
friar
at
her
right
hand
to
say
grace
he
delivered
a
longish
one
the
moment
he
began
she
clapped
her
white
hands
piously
together
and
held
them
up
joined
for
mortals
to
admire
is
an
excellent
pose
for
taper
white
fingers
and
cast
her
eyes
upward
towards
heaven
and
felt
as
thankful
to
it
as
a
magpie
does
while
cutting
off
with
your
thimble
after
supper
the
two
friends
went
to
the
and
eyed
the
the
mistress
joined
them
and
pointed
out
the
the
borough
gaol
catherine
church
etc
this
was
courteous
to
say
the
least
but
the
true
cause
soon
revealed
itself
the
fair
hand
was
poked
right
under
their
eyes
every
time
an
object
was
indicated
and
gerard
eyed
it
like
a
basilisk
and
longed
for
a
bunch
of
nettles
the
sun
set
and
the
travellers
few
in
number
drew
round
the
great
roaring
fire
and
omitting
to
go
on
the
spit
were
frozen
behind
though
roasted
in
front
for
if
the
german
stoves
were
oppressively
hot
the
french
salles
manger
were
bitterly
cold
and
above
all
stormy
in
germany
men
sat
bareheaded
round
the
stove
and
took
off
their
upper
clothes
but
in
burgundy
they
kept
on
their
hats
and
put
on
their
warmest
furs
to
sit
round
the
great
open
chimney
places
at
which
the
external
air
rushed
furiously
from
door
and
window
however
it
seems
their
mediaeval
backs
were
broad
enough
to
bear
it
for
they
made
themselves
not
only
comfortable
but
merry
and
broke
harmless
jests
over
each
other
in
turn
for
instance
denys
new
shoes
though
not
in
direct
communication
had
this
day
exploded
with
sympathy
and
unanimity
where
do
you
buy
your
shoon
soldier
asked
one
denys
looked
askant
at
gerard
and
not
liking
the
theme
shook
it
off
i
gather
off
the
trees
by
the
roadside
said
he
surlily
then
you
gathered
these
too
ripe
said
the
hostess
who
was
only
a
fool
externally
ay
rotten
ripe
observed
another
inspecting
them
gerard
said
nothing
but
pointed
the
circular
satire
by
pantomime
he
slily
put
out
both
his
feet
one
after
another
under
denys
eye
with
their
german
shoes
on
which
a
hundred
leagues
of
travel
had
produced
no
effect
they
seemed
hewn
out
of
a
rock
at
this
i
twist
the
smooth
varlet
neck
that
sold
me
mine
shouted
denys
in
huge
wrath
and
confirmed
the
threat
with
singular
oaths
peculiar
to
the
mediaeval
military
the
landlady
put
her
fingers
in
her
ears
thereby
exhibiting
the
hand
in
a
fresh
attitude
tell
me
when
he
has
done
his
orisons
somebody
said
she
mincingly
and
after
that
they
fell
to
telling
stories
gerard
when
his
turn
came
told
the
adventure
of
denys
and
gerard
at
the
inn
in
domfront
and
so
well
that
the
hearers
were
rapt
into
sweet
oblivion
of
the
very
existence
of
mijauree
and
hands
but
this
made
her
very
uneasy
and
she
had
recourse
to
her
grand
coup
this
misdirected
genius
had
for
a
twelvemonth
past
practised
yawning
and
could
do
it
now
at
any
moment
so
naturally
as
to
set
all
creation
gaping
could
all
creation
have
seen
her
by
this
means
she
got
in
all
her
charms
for
first
she
showed
her
teeth
then
out
of
good
breeding
you
know
closed
her
mouth
with
three
taper
fingers
so
the
moment
gerard
story
got
too
interesting
and
absorbing
she
turned
to
and
made
yawns
and
croix
sur
la
this
was
all
very
fine
but
gerard
was
an
artist
and
artists
are
chilled
by
gaping
auditors
he
bore
up
against
the
yawns
a
long
time
but
finding
they
came
from
a
bottomless
reservoir
lost
both
heart
and
temper
and
suddenly
rising
in
mid
narrative
said
but
i
weary
our
hostess
and
i
am
tired
myself
so
good
night
whipped
a
candle
off
the
dresser
whispered
denys
i
can
not
stand
her
and
marched
to
bed
in
a
moment
the
mijauree
coloured
and
bit
her
lips
she
had
not
intended
her
byplay
for
gerard
eye
and
she
saw
in
a
moment
she
had
been
rude
and
silly
and
publicly
rebuked
she
sat
with
cheek
on
fire
and
a
little
natural
water
in
her
eyes
and
looked
ten
times
comelier
and
more
womanly
and
interesting
than
she
had
done
all
day
the
desertion
of
the
best
narrator
broke
up
the
party
and
the
unassuming
denys
approached
the
meditative
mijauree
and
invited
her
in
the
most
flattering
terms
to
gamble
with
him
she
started
from
her
reverie
looked
him
down
into
the
earth
centre
with
chilling
dignity
and
consented
for
she
remembered
all
in
a
moment
what
a
show
of
hands
gambling
admitted
the
soldier
and
the
mijauree
rattled
the
dice
in
which
sport
she
was
so
taken
up
with
her
hands
that
she
forgot
to
cheat
and
denys
won
an
ecu
au
soleil
of
her
she
fumbled
slowly
with
her
purse
partly
because
her
sex
do
not
burn
to
pay
debts
of
honour
partly
to
admire
the
play
of
her
little
knuckles
peeping
between
their
soft
white
cushions
denys
proposed
a
compromise
three
silver
franks
i
win
of
you
fair
hostess
give
me
now
three
kisses
of
this
white
hand
and
we
cry
you
are
malapert
said
the
lady
with
a
toss
of
her
head
besides
they
are
so
dirty
see
they
are
like
ink
and
to
convince
him
she
put
them
out
to
him
and
turned
them
up
and
down
they
were
no
dirtier
than
cream
fresh
from
the
cob
and
she
knew
it
she
was
eternally
washing
and
scenting
them
denys
read
the
objection
like
the
observant
warrior
he
was
seized
them
and
mumbled
them
finding
him
so
appreciative
of
her
charm
she
said
timidly
will
you
do
me
a
kindness
good
soldier
a
thousand
fair
hostess
an
you
nay
i
ask
but
one
is
to
tell
thy
comrade
i
was
right
sorry
to
lose
his
most
thrilling
story
and
i
hope
he
will
tell
me
the
rest
morning
meantime
i
shall
not
sleep
for
thinking
o
wilt
tell
him
that
to
pleasure
me
ay
i
tell
the
young
savage
but
he
is
not
worthy
of
your
condescension
sweet
hostess
he
would
rather
be
aside
a
man
than
a
woman
any
so
would
ahem
he
is
right
the
young
women
of
the
day
are
not
worthy
of
him
tas
des
mijaurees
he
has
a
good
honest
and
right
comely
face
any
way
i
would
not
guest
of
mine
should
think
me
unmannerly
not
for
all
the
world
wilt
keep
faith
with
me
and
tell
him
on
this
fair
hand
i
swear
it
and
thus
i
seal
the
there
no
need
to
melt
the
wax
though
now
go
to
bed
and
tell
him
ere
you
the
perverse
toad
i
thank
thee
manon
for
teaching
me
that
word
was
inclined
to
bestow
her
slight
affections
upon
gerard
not
that
she
was
inflammable
far
less
so
than
many
that
passed
for
prudes
in
the
town
but
gerard
possessed
a
triple
attraction
that
has
ensnared
coquettes
in
all
ages
he
was
very
handsome
he
did
not
admire
her
the
least
he
had
given
her
a
good
slap
in
the
face
denys
woke
gerard
and
gave
the
message
gerard
was
not
enchanted
dost
wake
a
tired
man
to
tell
him
that
am
i
to
be
pestered
with
by
night
as
well
as
day
but
i
tell
thee
novice
thou
hast
conquered
her
trust
to
my
experience
her
voice
sank
to
melodious
whispers
and
the
cunning
jade
did
in
a
manner
bribe
me
to
carry
thee
her
challenge
to
love
lists
for
so
i
read
her
denys
then
assuming
the
senior
and
the
man
of
the
world
told
gerard
the
time
was
come
to
show
him
how
a
soldier
understood
friendship
and
camaraderie
italy
was
now
out
of
the
question
fate
had
provided
better
and
the
blind
jade
fortune
had
smiled
on
merit
for
once
the
head
of
gold
had
been
a
prosperous
inn
would
be
again
with
a
man
at
its
head
a
good
general
laid
plans
but
was
always
ready
to
abandon
them
should
some
brilliant
advantage
offer
and
to
reap
the
full
harvest
of
the
unforeseen
was
chiefly
by
this
trait
great
leaders
defeated
little
ones
for
these
latter
could
do
nothing
not
cut
and
dried
beforehand
sorry
friendship
that
would
marry
me
to
a
mijauree
interposed
gerard
yawning
comrade
be
reasonable
is
not
the
friskiest
sheep
that
falls
down
the
cliff
all
creatures
must
have
their
fling
soon
or
late
and
why
not
a
woman
what
more
frivolous
than
a
kitten
what
graver
than
a
cat
hast
a
good
eye
for
nature
denys
said
gerard
that
i
proclaim
a
better
for
thine
interest
boy
trust
then
to
me
these
little
doves
they
are
my
study
day
and
night
happy
the
man
whose
wife
taketh
her
fling
before
wedlock
and
who
trippeth
up
the
instead
of
down
marriage
it
always
changeth
them
for
better
or
else
for
worse
why
gerard
she
is
honest
when
all
is
done
and
he
is
no
man
nor
half
a
man
that
can
not
mould
any
honest
lass
like
a
bit
of
warm
wax
and
she
aye
aside
him
at
bed
and
board
i
tell
thee
in
one
month
thou
wilt
make
of
this
coquette
the
matron
the
most
sober
in
the
town
and
of
all
its
wives
the
one
most
docile
and
submissive
why
she
is
half
tamed
already
nine
in
ten
meek
and
mild
ones
had
gently
hated
thee
like
poison
all
their
lives
for
wounding
of
their
hidden
pride
but
she
for
an
affront
proffers
affection
by
joshua
his
bugle
a
generous
lass
and
void
of
petty
malice
when
thou
wast
gone
she
sat
and
spoke
not
a
sure
sign
of
love
in
one
of
her
sex
for
of
all
things
else
they
speak
ere
they
think
also
her
voice
did
sink
exceeding
low
in
discoursing
of
thee
and
murmured
sweetly
another
infallible
sign
the
bolt
hath
struck
and
rankles
in
her
oh
be
joyful
art
silent
i
see
is
settled
i
shall
go
alone
to
remiremont
alone
and
sad
but
pillage
and
poleaxes
what
care
i
for
that
since
my
dear
comrade
will
stay
here
landlord
of
the
and
safe
from
all
the
storms
of
life
wilt
think
of
me
gerard
now
and
then
by
thy
warm
fire
of
me
camped
on
some
windy
heath
or
lying
in
wet
trenches
or
wounded
on
the
field
and
far
from
comfort
nay
and
this
he
said
in
a
manner
truly
noble
not
comfortless
or
cold
or
wet
or
bleeding
still
warm
my
heart
to
lie
on
my
back
and
think
that
i
have
placed
my
dear
friend
and
comrade
true
in
the
far
from
a
soldier
i
let
you
run
on
dear
denys
said
gerard
softly
because
at
each
word
you
show
me
the
treasure
of
a
good
heart
but
now
bethink
thee
my
troth
is
plighted
there
where
my
heart
it
clingeth
you
so
leal
would
you
make
me
disloyal
perdition
seize
me
but
i
forgot
that
said
denys
no
more
then
but
hie
thee
to
bed
good
denys
next
to
margaret
i
love
thee
best
on
earth
and
value
thy
far
more
than
a
dozen
of
these
so
prithee
call
me
at
the
first
blush
of
morn
and
let
away
ere
the
woman
with
the
hands
be
they
rose
with
the
dawn
and
broke
their
fast
by
the
kitchen
fire
denys
inquired
of
the
girl
whether
the
mistress
was
about
nay
but
she
hath
risen
from
her
bed
by
the
same
token
i
am
carrying
her
this
to
clean
her
withal
and
she
filled
a
jug
with
boiling
water
and
took
it
upstairs
behold
said
gerard
the
very
elements
must
be
warmed
to
suit
her
skin
what
had
the
saints
said
which
still
chose
the
coldest
pool
away
ere
she
come
down
and
catch
they
paid
the
score
and

its
mistress
was
washing
her
hands
chapter
xxxviii
outside
the
town
they
found
the
snow
fresh
trampled
by
innumerable
wolves
every
foot
of
the
road
we
did
well
to
take
the
old
man
advice
ay
did
we
for
now
i
think
o
i
did
hear
them
last
night
scurrying
under
our
window
and
howling
and
whining
for
man
flesh
in
yon
but
no
fat
burgher
did
pity
the
poor
vagabones
and
drop
out
o
gerard
smiled
but
with
an
air
of
abstraction
and
they
plodded
on
in
silence
what
dost
meditate
so
profoundly
thy
denys
was
anything
but
pleased
at
this
answer
amongst
his
oddities
you
may
have
observed
that
he
could
stand
a
great
deal
of
real
impertinence
he
was
so
but
would
fire
up
now
and
then
where
not
even
the
shadow
of
a
ground
for
anger
existed
a
civil
question
merits
a
civil
reply
said
he
very
drily
alas
i
meant
no
other
said
gerard
then
why
pretend
you
were
thinking
of
my
goodness
when
you
know
i
have
no
goodness
under
my
skin
had
another
said
this
i
had
answered
liest
but
to
thee
i
say
no
eye
for
men
qualities
but
only
for
women
and
once
more
i
do
defy
thy
unreasonable
choler
and
say
i
was
thinking
on
thy
goodness
of
overnight
wouldst
have
wedded
me
to
the
or
rather
to
the
de
veau
doree
and
left
thyself
oh
are
ye
there
lad
said
denys
recovering
his
good
humour
in
a
moment
well
but
to
speak
sooth
i
meant
that
not
for
goodness
but
for
friendship
and
true
fellowship
no
more
and
let
me
tell
you
my
young
master
my
conscience
it
pricketh
me
even
now
for
letting
you
turn
your
back
thus
on
fortune
and
peaceful
days
a
truer
friend
than
i
had
and
somewhat
hamstrung
thee
then
hadst
thou
been
fain
to
lie
smarting
at
the
a
month
or
so
yon
skittish
lass
had
nursed
thee
tenderly
and
all
had
been
well
blade
i
had
in
hand
to
but
remembering
how
thou
hatest
pain
though
it
be
but
a
scratch
my
craven
heart
it
failed
me
at
the
and
denys
wore
a
look
of
humble
apology
for
his
lack
of
virtuous
resolution
when
the
path
of
duty
lay
so
clear
gerard
raised
his
eyebrows
with
astonishment
at
this
monstrous
but
thoroughly
characteristic
revelation
however
this
new
and
delicate
point
of
friendship
was
never
discussed
whether
one
ought
in
all
love
to
cut
the
tendon
achilles
of
one
friend
for
an
incident
interposed
here
cometh
one
in
our
rear
on
his
neighbour
mule
shouted
denys
gerard
turned
round
and
how
know
ye
is
not
his
own
pray
oh
blind
because
he
rides
it
with
no
and
in
truth
the
man
came
galloping
like
a
fury
but
what
astonished
the
friends
most
was
that
on
reaching
them
the
rustic
rider
eyes
opened
and
he
drew
the
rein
so
suddenly
and
powerfully
that
the
mule
stuck
out
her
and
went
sliding
between
the
pedestrians
like
a
table
on
castors
i
trow
ye
are
from
the
they
assented
which
of
ye
is
the
younger
he
that
was
born
the
later
said
denys
winking
at
his
companion
gramercy
for
the
come
divine
then
and
shall
thy
beard
is
ripe
thy
fellow
is
green
he
shall
be
the
younger
here
and
he
held
him
out
a
paper
packet
ye
left
this
at
the
and
our
mistress
sends
it
nay
good
fellow
methinks
i
left
and
gerard
felt
his
pouch
etc
would
ye
make
our
burgess
a
liar
said
the
rustic
reproachfully
and
shall
i
have
no
pourboire
still
more
reproachfully
and
came
ventre
a
nay
thou
shalt
have
pourboire
and
he
gave
him
a
small
coin
a
la
bonne
heure
cried
the
clown
and
his
features
beamed
with
disproportionate
joy
the
virgin
go
with
ye
come
up
jenny
and
back
he
went
stomach
to
earth
as
his
nation
is
pleased
to
call
it
gerard
undid
the
packet
it
was
about
six
inches
square
and
inside
it
he
found
another
packet
which
contained
a
packet
and
so
on
at
the
fourth
he
hurled
the
whole
thing
into
the
snow
denys
took
it
out
and
rebuked
his
petulance
he
excused
himself
on
the
ground
of
hating
affectation
denys
attested
great
toe
of
the
little
daughter
of
there
was
no
affectation
here
but
only
woman
good
wit
doubtless
the
wraps
contained
something
which
out
of
delicacy
or
her
sex
lovely
cunning
she
would
not
her
hind
should
see
her
bestow
on
a
young
man
thy
garter
to
i
wear
her
own
then
or
a
lock
of
her
hair
what
is
this
a
piece
of
raw
silk
fresh
from
the
worm
well
of
all
the
love
tokens
now
who
but
thee
ever
dreamed
that
she
is
so
naught
as
send
me
love
tokens
i
saw
no
harm
in
her
barring
her
stay
here
is
something
hard
lurking
in
this
soft
nest
come
forth
i
say
little
nestling
saints
and
pikestaves
look
at
this
it
was
a
gold
ring
with
a
great
amethyst
glowing
and
sparkling
full
coloured
but
pure
as
crystal
how
lovely
said
gerard
innocently
and
here
is
something
writ
read
it
thou
i
read
not
so
glib
as
some
when
i
know
not
the
matter
gerard
took
the
paper
is
a
posy
and
fairly
enough
he
read
the
lines
blushing
like
a
girl
they
were
very
naive
and
may
be
thus
englished
with
thee
my
heart
is
fledde
come
back
to
the
hedde
wilt
not
yet
this
token
keepe
of
hir
who
doeth
thy
goeing
weepe
gyf
the
world
prove
harsh
and
cold
come
back
to
hedde
of
gold
the
little
dove
purred
denys
the
great
owl
to
go
and
risk
her
good
name
thus
however
thank
heaven
she
has
played
this
prank
with
an
honest
lad
that
will
expose
her
folly
but
oh
the
perverseness
could
she
not
bestow
her
nauseousness
on
thee
denys
sighed
and
shrugged
on
thee
that
art
as
ripe
for
folly
as
herself
denys
confessed
that
his
young
friend
had
harped
his
very
thought
was
passing
strange
to
him
that
a
damsel
with
eyes
in
her
head
should
pass
by
a
man
and
bestow
her
affections
on
a
boy
still
he
could
not
but
recognize
in
this
the
bounty
of
nature
boys
were
human
beings
after
all
and
but
for
this
occasional
caprice
of
women
their
lot
would
be
too
terrible
they
would
be
out
of
the
sun
altogether
blighted
and
never
come
to
anything
since
only
the
fair
could
make
a
man
out
of
such
unpromising
materials
as
a
boy
gerard
interrupted
this
flattering
discourse
to
beg
the
acceptance
of
the
ring
he
refused
it
flatly
and
insisted
on
gerard
going
back
to
the
tete
at
once
ring
and
all
like
a
man
and
not
letting
a
poor
girl
hold
out
her
arms
to
him
in
vain
her
hands
you
her
hand
with
the
in
failing
in
this
he
was
for
putting
the
ring
on
his
friend
finger
gerard
declined
i
wear
a
ring
what
that
sorry
gimcrack
why
is
pewter
or
tin
at
best
and
this
virgin
gold
forbye
the
ay
but
was
margaret
gave
me
this
one
and
i
value
it
above
rubies
i
neither
part
with
it
nor
give
it
a
rival
and
he
kissed
the
base
metal
and
bade
it
fear
nought
i
see
the
owl
hath
sent
her
ring
to
a
goose
said
denys
sorrowfully
however
he
prevailed
on
gerard
to
fasten
it
inside
his
bonnet
to
this
indeed
the
lad
consented
very
readily
for
sovereign
qualities
were
universally
ascribed
to
certain
jewels
and
the
amethyst
ranked
high
among
these
precious
talismans
when
this
was
disposed
of
gerard
earnestly
requested
his
friend
to
let
the
matter
drop
since
speaking
of
the
other
sex
to
him
made
him
pine
so
for
margaret
and
almost
unmanned
him
with
the
thought
that
each
step
was
taking
him
farther
from
her
i
am
no
general
lover
denys
there
is
room
in
my
heart
for
one
sweetheart
and
for
one
friend
i
am
far
from
my
dear
mistress
and
my
friend
a
few
leagues
more
and
i
must
lose
him
too
oh
let
me
drink
thy
friendship
pure
while
i
may
and
not
dilute
with
any
of
these
stupid
and
shalt
and
shalt
said
denys
kindly
but
as
to
my
leaving
thee
at
remiremont
reckon
thou
not
on
that
for
three
consecutive
oaths
if
i
do
nay
i
shall
propose
to
thee
to
stay
hours
there
while
i
kiss
my
mother
and
sisters
and
the
females
generally
and
on
go
you
and
i
together
to
the
denys
denys
denys
nor
me
is
settled
gainsay
me
not
or
i
go
with
thee
to
rome
why
not
his
holiness
the
pope
hath
ever
some
little
merry
pleasant
war
toward
and
a
burgundian
soldier
is
still
welcome
in
his
on
this
gerard
opened
his
heart
denys
ere
i
fell
in
with
thee
i
used
often
to
halt
on
the
road
unable
to
go
farther
my
puny
heart
so
pulled
me
back
and
then
after
a
short
prayer
to
the
saints
for
aid
would
i
rise
and
drag
my
most
unwilling
body
onward
but
since
i
joined
company
with
thee
great
is
my
courage
i
have
found
the
saying
of
the
ancients
true
that
better
is
a
bright
comrade
on
the
weary
road
than
a
and
dear
brother
when
i
do
think
of
what
we
have
done
and
suffered
together
savedst
my
life
from
the
bear
and
from
yet
more
savage
thieves
and
even
poor
i
did
make
shift
to
draw
thee
out
of
rhine
and
somehow
loved
thee
double
from
that
hour
how
many
ties
tender
and
strong
between
us
had
i
my
will
i
never
never
never
never
part
with
my
denys
on
this
side
the
grave
god
his
will
be
done
no
my
will
shall
be
done
this
time
shouted
denys
le
bon
dieu
has
bigger
fish
to
fry
than
you
or
me
i
go
with
thee
to
rome
there
is
my
hand
on
think
what
you
say
is
impossible
is
too
selfish
of
i
tell
thee
is
settled
no
power
can
change
me
at
remiremont
i
borrow
ten
pieces
of
my
uncle
and
on
we
go
is
they
shook
hands
over
it
then
gerard
said
nothing
for
his
heart
was
too
full
but
he
ran
twice
round
his
companion
as
he
walked
then
danced
backwards
in
front
of
him
and
finally
took
his
hand
and
so
on
they
went
hand
in
hand
like
sweethearts
till
a
company
of
mounted
soldiers
about
fifty
in
number
rose
to
sight
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
see
the
banner
of
burgundy
said
denys
joyfully
i
shall
look
out
for
a
comrade
among
how
gorgeous
is
the
standard
in
the
sun
said
gerard
and
how
brave
are
the
leaders
with
velvet
and
feathers
and
steel
breastplates
like
glassy
mirrors
when
they
came
near
enough
to
distinguish
faces
denys
uttered
an
exclamation
why
is
the
bastard
of
burgundy
as
i
live
nay
then
there
is
fighting
since
he
is
out
a
gallant
leader
gerard
rates
his
life
no
higher
than
a
private
soldier
and
a
soldier
no
higher
than
a
tomtit
and
that
is
the
captain
for
and
see
denys
the
very
mules
with
their
great
brass
frontlets
and
trappings
seem
proud
to
carry
them
no
wonder
men
itch
to
be
soldiers
and
in
the
midst
of
this
innocent
admiration
the
troop
came
up
with
them
halt
cried
a
stentorian
voice
the
troop
halted
the
bastard
of
burgundy
bent
his
brow
gloomily
on
denys
how
now
arbalestrier
how
comes
it
thy
face
is
turned
southward
when
every
good
hand
and
heart
is
hurrying
northward
denys
replied
respectfully
that
he
was
going
on
leave
after
some
years
of
service
to
see
his
kindred
at
remiremont
good
but
this
is
not
the
time
the
duchy
is
disturbed
ho
bring
that
dead
soldier
mule
to
the
front
and
thou
mount
her
and
forward
with
us
to
so
please
your
highness
said
denys
firmly
that
may
not
be
my
home
is
close
at
hand
i
have
not
seen
it
these
three
years
and
above
all
i
have
this
poor
youth
in
charge
whom
i
may
not
can
not
leave
till
i
see
him
shipped
for
rome
dost
bandy
words
with
me
said
the
chief
with
amazement
turning
fast
to
wrath
art
weary
o
thy
life
let
go
the
youth
hand
and
into
the
saddle
without
more
idle
denys
made
no
reply
but
he
held
gerard
hand
the
tighter
and
looked
defiance
at
this
the
bastard
roared
jarnac
dismount
six
of
thy
archers
and
shoot
me
this
cur
dead
where
he
stands
for
an
the
young
count
de
jarnac
second
in
command
gave
the
order
and
the
men
dismounted
to
execute
it
strip
him
naked
said
the
bastard
in
the
cold
tone
of
military
business
and
put
his
arms
and
accoutrements
on
the
spare
mule
maybe
find
some
clown
worthier
to
wear
denys
groaned
aloud
am
i
to
be
shamed
as
well
as
slain
oh
nay
nay
nay
cried
gerard
awaking
from
the
stupor
into
which
this
thunderbolt
of
tyranny
had
thrown
him
he
shall
go
with
you
on
the
instant
i
liever
part
with
him
for
ever
than
see
a
hair
of
his
dear
head
harmed
oh
sir
oh
my
lord
give
a
poor
boy
but
a
minute
to
bid
his
only
friend
farewell
he
will
go
with
you
i
swear
he
shall
go
with
the
stern
leader
nodded
a
cold
contemptuous
assent
thou
jarnac
stay
with
them
and
bring
him
on
alive
or
dead
forward
and
he
resumed
his
march
followed
by
all
the
band
but
the
young
count
and
six
archers
one
of
whom
held
the
spare
mule
denys
and
gerard
gazed
at
one
another
haggardly
oh
what
a
look
and
after
this
mute
interchange
of
anguish
they
spoke
hurriedly
for
the
moments
were
flying
by
thou
goest
to
holland
thou
knowest
where
she
bides
tell
her
all
she
will
be
kind
to
thee
for
my
oh
sorry
tale
that
i
shall
carry
her
for
god
sake
go
back
to
the
i
am
mad
hush
let
me
think
have
i
nought
to
say
to
thee
denys
my
head
my
head
ah
i
have
it
make
for
the
rhine
gerard
strasbourg
is
but
a
step
and
down
the
current
to
rotterdam
margaret
is
there
i
go
thither
tell
her
thou
art
coming
we
shall
all
be
my
lads
haste
ye
or
you
will
get
us
into
trouble
said
the
count
firmly
but
not
harshly
now
oh
sir
one
moment
one
little
moment
panted
gerard
cursed
be
the
land
i
born
in
cursed
be
the
race
of
man
and
he
that
made
them
what
they
are
screamed
denys
hush
denys
hush
blaspheme
not
oh
god
forgive
him
he
wots
not
what
he
says
be
patient
denys
be
patient
though
we
meet
no
more
on
earth
let
us
meet
in
a
better
world
where
no
blasphemer
may
enter
to
my
heart
lost
friend
for
what
are
words
now
he
held
out
his
arms
and
they
locked
one
another
in
a
close
embrace
they
kissed
one
another
again
and
again
speechless
and
the
tears
rained
down
their
cheeks
and
the
count
jarnac
looked
on
amazed
but
the
rougher
soldiers
to
whom
comrade
was
a
sacred
name
looked
on
with
some
pity
in
their
hard
faces
then
at
a
signal
from
jarnac
with
kind
force
and
words
of
rude
consolation
they
almost
lifted
denys
on
to
the
mule
and
putting
him
in
the
middle
of
them
spurred
after
their
leader
and
gerard
ran
wildly
after
for
the
lane
turned
to
see
the
very
last
of
him
and
the
last
glimpse
he
caught
denys
was
rocking
to
and
fro
on
his
mule
and
tearing
his
hair
out
but
at
this
sight
something
rose
in
gerard
throat
so
high
so
high
he
could
run
no
more
nor
breathe
but
gasped
and
leaned
against
the
hedge
seizing
it
and
choking
piteously
the
thorns
ran
into
his
hand
after
a
bitter
struggle
he
got
his
breath
again
and
now
began
to
see
his
own
misfortune
yet
not
all
at
once
to
realize
it
so
sudden
and
numbing
was
the
stroke
he
staggered
on
but
scarce
feeling
or
caring
whither
he
was
going
and
every
now
and
then
he
stopped
and
his
arms
fell
and
his
head
sank
on
his
chest
and
he
stood
motionless
then
he
said
to
himself
can
this
thing
be
this
must
be
a
dream
is
scarce
five
minutes
since
we
were
so
happy
walking
handed
faring
to
rome
together
and
we
admired
them
and
their
gay
banners
and
helmets
oh
hearts
of
hell
all
nature
seemed
to
stare
now
as
lonely
as
himself
not
a
creature
in
sight
no
colour
but
white
he
the
ghost
of
his
former
self
wandered
alone
among
the
ghosts
of
trees
and
fields
and
hedges
desolate
desolate
desolate
all
was
desolate
he
knelt
and
gathered
a
little
snow
nay
i
dream
not
for
this
is
snow
cold
as
the
world
heart
it
is
bloody
too
what
may
that
mean
fool
is
from
thy
hand
i
mind
not
the
wound
ay
i
see
thorns
welcome
kindly
foes
i
felt
ye
not
ye
ran
not
into
my
heart
ye
are
not
cruel
like
he
had
risen
and
was
dragging
his
leaden
limbs
along
when
he
heard
horses
feet
and
gay
voices
behind
him
he
turned
with
a
joyful
but
wild
hope
that
the
soldiers
had
relented
and
were
bringing
denys
back
but
no
it
was
a
gay
cavalcade
a
gentleman
of
rank
and
his
favourites
in
velvet
and
furs
and
feathers
and
four
or
five
armed
retainers
in
buff
jerkins
they
swept
gaily
by
gerard
never
looked
at
them
after
they
were
gone
by
certain
gay
shadows
had
come
and
passed
that
was
all
he
was
like
one
in
a
dream
but
he
was
rudely
wakened
suddenly
a
voice
in
front
of
him
cried
harshly
stand
and
deliver
and
there
were
three
of
the
gentleman
servants
in
front
of
him
they
had
ridden
back
to
rob
him
how
ye
false
knaves
said
he
quite
calmly
would
ye
shame
your
noble
master
he
will
hang
ye
to
the
nearest
tree
and
with
these
words
he
drew
his
sword
doggedly
and
set
his
back
to
the
hedge
one
of
the
men
instantly
levelled
his
petronel
at
him
but
another
less
sanguinary
interposed
be
not
so
hasty
and
be
not
thou
so
mad
look
yonder
gerard
looked
and
scarce
a
hundred
yards
off
the
nobleman
and
his
friends
had
halted
and
sat
on
their
horses
looking
at
the
lawless
act
too
proud
to
do
their
own
dirty
work
but
not
too
proud
to
reap
the
fruit
and
watch
lest
their
agents
should
rob
them
of
another
money
the
milder
servant
then
a
fellow
showed
gerard
resistance
was
vain
reminded
him
common
thieves
often
took
the
life
as
well
as
the
purse
and
assured
him
it
cost
a
mint
to
be
a
gentleman
his
master
had
lost
money
at
play
overnight
and
was
going
to
visit
his
leman
and
so
must
take
money
where
he
saw
it
therefore
good
youth
consider
that
we
rob
not
for
ourselves
and
deliver
us
that
fat
purse
at
thy
girdle
without
more
ado
nor
put
us
to
the
pain
of
slitting
thy
throat
and
taking
it
all
the
this
knave
is
right
said
gerard
calmly
aloud
but
to
himself
i
ought
not
to
fling
away
my
life
margaret
would
be
so
sorry
take
then
the
poor
man
purse
to
the
rich
man
pouch
and
with
it
this
tell
him
i
pray
the
holy
trinity
each
coin
in
it
may
burn
his
hand
and
freeze
his
heart
and
blast
his
soul
for
ever
begone
and
leave
me
to
my
sorrow
he
flung
them
the
purse
they
rode
away
muttering
for
his
words
pricked
them
a
little
a
very
little
and
he
staggered
on
penniless
now
as
well
as
friendless
till
he
came
to
the
edge
of
a
wood
then
though
his
heart
could
hardly
feel
this
second
blow
his
judgment
did
and
he
began
to
ask
himself
what
was
the
use
going
further
he
sat
down
on
the
hard
road
and
ran
his
nails
into
his
hair
and
tried
to
think
for
the
best
a
task
all
the
more
difficult
that
a
strange
drowsiness
was
stealing
over
him
rome
he
could
never
reach
without
money
denys
had
said
go
to
strasbourg
and
down
the
rhine
he
would
obey
denys
but
how
to
get
to
strasbourg
without
money
then
suddenly
seemed
to
ring
in
his
ears
gyf
the
world
prove
harsh
and
cold
come
back
to
the
hedde
of
and
if
i
do
i
must
go
as
her
servant
i
who
am
margaret
i
am
i
will
sleep
and
dream
all
is
as
it
was
ah
me
how
happy
were
we
an
hour
agone
we
little
knew
how
happy
there
is
a
house
the
owner
what
if
i
told
him
my
wrong
and
prayed
his
aid
to
retrieve
my
purse
and
so
to
rhine
fool
is
he
not
a
man
like
the
rest
he
would
scorn
me
and
trample
me
lower
denys
cursed
the
race
of
men
that
will
i
never
but
oh
i
begin
to
loathe
and
dread
them
nay
here
will
i
lie
till
sunset
then
darkling
creep
into
this
rich
barn
and
take
by
stealth
a
draught
of
milk
or
a
handful
o
grain
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
god
who
hath
seen
the
rich
rob
me
will
peradventure
forgive
me
they
say
is
ill
sleeping
on
the
snow
death
steals
on
such
sleepers
with
muffled
feet
and
honey
breath
but
what
can
i
i
am
shall
this
be
the
wood
where
lie
the
wolves
yon
old
man
spoke
of
i
must
trust
them
they
are
not
men
and
i
am
so
he
crawled
to
the
roadside
and
stretched
out
his
limbs
on
the
snow
with
a
deep
sigh
ah
tear
not
thine
hair
so
teareth
my
heart
to
see
margaret
never
see
me
more
poor
and
the
too
tender
heart
was
still
and
the
constant
lover
and
friend
of
antique
mould
lay
silent
on
the
snow
in
peril
from
the
weather
in
peril
from
wild
beasts
in
peril
from
hunger
friendless
and
penniless
in
a
strange
land
and
not
halfway
to
rome
chapter

rude
travel
is
enticing
to
us
english
and
so
are
its
records
even
though
the
adventurer
be
no
pilgrim
of
love
and
antique
friendship
has
at
least
the
interest
of
a
fossil
still
as
the
true
centre
of
this
story
is
in
holland
it
is
full
time
to
return
thither
and
to
those
ordinary
personages
and
incidents
whereof
life
has
been
mainly
composed
in
all
ages
jorian
ketel
came
to
peter
house
to
claim
margaret
promise
but
margaret
was
ill
in
bed
and
peter
on
hearing
his
errand
affronted
him
and
warned
him
off
the
premises
and
one
or
two
that
stood
by
were
for
ducking
him
for
both
father
and
daughter
were
favourites
and
the
whole
story
was
in
every
mouth
and
sevenbergens
in
that
state
of
hot
undiscriminating
irritation
which
accompanies
popular
sympathy
so
jorian
ketel
went
off
in
dudgeon
and
repented
him
of
his
good
deed
this
sort
of
penitence
is
not
rare
and
has
the
merit
of
being
sincere
dierich
brower
who
was
discovered
at
the
three

making
a
chatterbox

to
worm

taken
and
flung
into
a
horsepond
and
threatened
with
worse
usage
should
he
ever
show
his
face
in
the
burgh
again
and
finally
municipal
jealousy
being
roused
the
burgomaster
of
sevenbergen
sent
a
formal
missive
to
the
burgomaster
of
tergou
reminding
him
he
had
overstepped
the
law
and
requesting
him
to
apply
to
the
authorities
of
sevenbergen
on
any
future
occasion
when
he
might
have
a
complaint
real
or
imaginary
against
any
of
its
townsfolk
the
wily
ghysbrecht
suppressing
his
rage
at
this
remonstrance
sent
back
a
civil
message
to
say
that
the
person
he
had
followed
to
sevenbergen
was
a
tergovian
one
gerard
and
that
he
had
stolen
the
town
records
that
gerard
having
escaped
into
foreign
parts
and
probably
taken
the
documents
with
him
the
whole
matter
was
at
an
end
thus
he
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
but
in
reality
his
calmness
was
but
a
veil
baffled
at
sevenbergen
he
turned
his
views
elsewhere
he
set
his
emissaries
to
learn
from
the
family
at
tergou
whither
gerard
had
fled
and
to
his
infinite
surprise
they
did
not
know
this
added
to
his
uneasiness
it
made
him
fear
gerard
was
only
lurking
in
the
neighbourhood
he
would
make
a
certain
discovery
and
would
come
back
and
take
a
terrible
revenge
from
this
time
dierich
and
others
that
were
about
him
noticed
a
change
for
the
worse
in
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
he
became
a
moody
irritable
man
a
dread
lay
on
him
his
eyes
cast
furtive
glances
like
one
who
expects
a
blow
and
knows
not
from
what
quarter
it
is
to
come
making
others
wretched
had
not
made
him
happy
it
seldom
does
the
little
family
at
tergou
which
but
for
his
violent
interference
might
in
time
have
cemented
its
difference
without
banishing
spem
gregis
to
a
distant
land
wore
still
the
same
outward
features
but
within
was
no
longer
the
simple
happy
family
this
tale
opened
with
little
kate
knew
the
share
cornelis
and
sybrandt
had
in
banishing
gerard
and
though
for
fear
of
making
more
mischief
still
she
never
told
her
mother
yet
there
were
times
she
shuddered
at
the
bare
sight
of
them
and
blushed
at
their
hypocritical
regrets
catherine
with
a
vigilance
noticed
this
and
with
a
woman
subtlety
said
nothing
but
quietly
pondered
it
and
went
on
watching
for
more
the
black
sheep
themselves
in
their
efforts
to
partake
in
the
general
gloom
and
sorrow
succeeded
so
far
as
to
impose
upon
their
father
and
giles
but
the
demure
satisfaction
that
lay
at
their
bottom
could
not
escape
these
feminine
eyes
that
noting
all
seem
nought
to
thus
mistrust
and
suspicion
sat
at
the
table
poor
substitutes
for
gerard
intelligent
face
that
had
brightened
the
whole
circle
unobserved
till
it
was
gone
as
for
the
old
hosier
his
pride
had
been
wounded
by
his
son
disobedience
and
so
he
bore
stiffly
up
and
did
his
best
never
to
mention
gerard
name
but
underneath
his
spartan
cloak
nature
might
be
seen
tugging
at
his
one
anxiety
he
never
affected
to
conceal
if
i
but
knew
where
the
boy
is
and
that
his
life
and
health
are
in
no
danger
small
would
be
my
care
would
he
say
and
then
a
deep
sigh
would
follow
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
if
gerard
had
opened
the
door
just
then
and
walked
in
there
would
have
been
many
tears
and
embraces
for
him
and
few
reproaches
or
none
one
thing
took
the
old
couple
quite
by
surprise
publicity
ere
gerard
had
been
gone
a
week
his
adventures
were
in
every
mouth
and
to
make
matters
worse
the
popular
sympathy
declared
itself
warmly
on
the
side
of
the
lovers
and
against
gerard
cruel
parents
and
that
old
busybody
the
burgomaster
who
must
put
his
nose
into
a
business
that
nowise
concerned
him
mother
said
kate
it
is
all
over
the
town
that
margaret
is
down
with
a
fever
a
burning
fever
her
father
fears
her
margaret
what
margaret
inquired
catherine
with
a
treacherous
assumption
of
calmness
and
indifference
oh
mother
whom
should
i
mean
why
gerard
gerard
margaret
screamed
catherine
how
dare
you
say
such
a
word
to
me
and
i
rede
you
never
mention
that
hussy
name
in
this
house
that
she
has
laid
bare
she
is
the
ruin
of
my
poor
boy
the
flower
of
all
my
flock
she
is
the
cause
that
he
is
not
a
holy
priest
in
the
midst
of
us
but
is
roaming
the
world
and
i
a
desolate
mother
there
do
not
cry
my
girl
i
do
ill
to
speak
harsh
to
you
but
oh
kate
you
know
not
what
passes
in
a
mother
heart
i
bear
up
before
you
all
it
behoves
me
swallow
my
fears
but
at
night
i
see
him
in
my
dreams
and
still
some
trouble
or
other
near
him
sometimes
he
is
torn
by
wild
beasts
other
times
he
is
in
the
hands
of
robbers
and
their
cruel
knives
uplifted
to
strike
his
poor
pale
face
that
one
should
think
would
move
a
stone
oh
when
i
remember
that
while
i
sit
here
in
comfort
perhaps
my
poor
boy
lies
dead
in
some
savage
place
and
all
along
of
that
girl
there
her
very
name
is
ratsbane
to
me
i
tremble
all
over
when
i
hear
i
not
say
anything
nor
do
anything
to
grieve
you
worse
mother
said
kate
tenderly
but
she
sighed
she
whose
name
was
so
fiercely
interdicted
in
this
house
was
much
spoken
of
and
even
pitied
elsewhere
all
sevenbergen
was
sorry
for
her
and
the
young
men
and
maidens
cast
many
a
pitying
glance
as
they
passed
at
the
little
window
where
the
beauty
of
the
village
lay
dying
for
in
this
familiar
phrase
they
underrated
her
spirit
and
unselfishness
gerard
was
not
dead
and
she
was
too
loyal
herself
to
doubt
his
constancy
her
father
was
dear
to
her
and
helpless
and
but
for
bodily
weakness
all
her
love
for
gerard
would
not
have
kept
her
from
doing
her
duties
though
she
might
have
gone
about
them
with
drooping
head
and
heavy
heart
but
physical
and
mental
excitement
had
brought
on
an
attack
of
fever
so
violent
that
nothing
but
youth
and
constitution
saved
her
the
malady
left
her
at
last
but
in
that
terrible
state
of
bodily
weakness
in
which
the
patient
feels
life
a
burden
then
it
is
that
love
and
friendship
by
the
bedside
are
mortal
angels
with
comfort
in
their
voice
and
healing
in
their
palms
but
this
poor
girl
had
to
come
back
to
life
and
vigour
how
she
could
many
days
she
lay
alone
and
the
heavy
hours
rolled
like
leaden
waves
over
her
in
her
enfeebled
state
existence
seemed
a
burden
and
life
a
thing
gone
by
she
could
not
try
her
best
to
get
well
gerard
was
gone
she
had
not
him
to
get
well
for
often
she
lay
for
hours
quite
still
with
the
tears
welling
gently
out
of
her
eyes
one
day
waking
from
an
uneasy
slumber
she
found
two
women
in
her
room
one
was
a
servant
the
other
by
the
deep
fur
on
her
collar
and
sleeves
was
a
person
of
consideration
a
narrow
band
of
silvery
hair
being
spared
by
her
coiffure
showed
her
to
be
past
the
age
when
women
of
sense
concealed
their
years
the
looks
of
both
were
kind
and
friendly
margaret
tried
to
raise
herself
in
the
bed
but
the
old
lady
placed
a
hand
very
gently
on
her
lie
still
sweetheart
we
come
not
here
to
put
you
about
but
to
comfort
you
god
willing
now
cheer
up
a
bit
and
tell
us
first
who
think
you
we
are
nay
madam
i
know
you
though
i
never
saw
you
before
you
are
the
demoiselle
van
eyck
and
this
is
reicht
heynes
gerard
has
oft
spoken
of
you
and
of
your
goodness
to
him
madam
he
has
no
friend
like
you
near
him
now
and
at
this
thought
she
lay
back
and
the
tears
welled
out
of
her
eyes
in
a
moment
the
reicht
heynes
began
to
cry
for
company
but
her
mistress
scolded
her
well
you
are
a
pretty
one
for
a
said
she
and
she
put
out
a
world
of
innocent
art
to
cheer
the
patient
and
not
without
some
little
success
an
old
woman
that
has
seen
life
and
all
its
troubles
is
a
sovereign
blessing
by
a
sorrowful
young
side
she
knows
what
to
say
and
what
to
avoid
she
knows
how
to
soothe
her
and
interest
her
ere
she
had
been
there
an
hour
she
had
head
lying
on
her
shoulder
instead
of
on
the
pillow
and
margaret
soft
eyes
dwelling
on
her
with
gentle
gratitude
ah
this
is
hair
said
the
old
lady
running
her
fingers
through
it
come
and
look
at
it
reicht
reicht
came
and
handled
it
and
praised
it
unaffectedly
the
poor
girl
that
owned
it
was
not
quite
out
of
the
reach
of
flattery
owing
doubtless
to
not
being
dead
in
sooth
madam
i
did
use
to
think
it
hideous
but
he
praised
it
and
ever
since
then
i
have
been
almost
vain
of
it
saints
forgive
me
you
know
how
foolish
those
are
that
they
are
greater
fools
that
do
said
the
old
lady
sharply
margaret
opened
her
lovely
eyes
and
looked
at
her
for
her
meaning
this
was
only
the
first
of
many
visits
in
fact
either
margaret
van
eyck
or
reicht
came
nearly
every
day
until
their
patient
was
convalescent
and
she
improved
rapidly
under
their
hands
reicht
attributed
this
principally
to
certain
nourishing
dishes
she
prepared
in
kitchen
but
margaret
herself
thought
more
of
the
kind
words
and
eyes
that
kept
telling
her
she
had
friends
to
live
for
martin
wittenhaagen
went
straight
to
rotterdam
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
the
bull
was
a
biped
with
a
crown
for
horns
it
was
philip
the
good
duke
of
this
earl
of
that
lord
of
the
other
arrived
at
rotterdam
martin
found
the
court
was
at
ghent
to
ghent
he
went
and
sought
an
audience
but
was
put
off
and
baffled
by
lackeys
and
pages
so
he
threw
himself
in
his
sovereign
way
out
hunting
and
contrary
to
all
court
precedents
commenced
the
conversation
by
roaring
lustily
for
mercy
why
where
is
the
peril
man
said
the
duke
looking
all
round
and
laughing
grace
for
an
old
soldier
hunted
down
by
burghers
now
kings
differ
in
character
like
other
folk
but
there
is
one
trait
they
have
in
common
they
are
mightily
inclined
to
be
affable
to
men
of
very
low
estate
these
do
not
vie
with
them
in
anything
whatever
so
jealousy
can
not
creep
in
and
they
amuse
them
by
their
bluntness
and
novelty
and
refresh
the
poor
things
with
a
touch
of
nature
a
rarity
in
courts
so
philip
the
good
reined
in
his
horse
and
gave
martin
almost
a
and
martin
reminded
him
of
a
certain
battlefield
where
he
had
received
an
arrow
intended
for
his
sovereign
the
duke
remembered
the
incident
perfectly
and
was
graciously
pleased
to
take
a
cheerful
view
of
it
he
could
afford
to
not
having
been
the
one
hit
then
martin
told
his
majesty
of
gerard
first
capture
in
the
church
his
imprisonment
in
the
tower
and
the
manoeuvre
by
which
they
got
him
out
and
all
the
details
of
the
hunt
and
whether
he
told
it
better
than
i
have
or
the
duke
had
not
heard
so
many
good
stories
as
you
have
certain
it
is
that
sovereign
got
so
wrapt
up
in
it
that
when
a
number
of
courtiers
came
galloping
up
and
interrupted
martin
he
swore
like
a
costermonger
and
threatened
only
half
in
jest
to
cut
off
the
next
head
that
should
come
between
him
and
a
good
story
and
when
martin
had
done
he
cried
out
st
luke
what
sport
goeth
on
in
this
mine
earldom
ay
in
my
own
woods
and
i
see
it
not
you
base
fellows
have
all
the
and
he
was
indignant
at
the
partiality
of
fortune
lo
you
now
this
was
a
said
he
i
never
had
the
luck
to
be
at
a
my
luck
was
none
so
great
replied
martin
bluntly
i
was
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
dogs
ah
so
you
were
i
forgot
and
royalty
was
more
reconciled
to
its
lot
what
would
you
then
a
free
pardon
your
highness
for
myself
and
for
what
for
go
to
the
bird
will
fly
from
the
cage
is
instinct
besides
coop
a
young
man
up
for
loving
a
young
woman
these
burgomasters
must
be
void
of
common
sense
what
else
for
striking
down
the
oh
the
hunted
boar
will
turn
to
bay
is
his
right
and
i
hold
him
less
than
man
that
grudges
it
him
what
else
for
killing
of
the
the
duke
countenance
fell
was
their
life
or
mine
said
martin
eagerly
ay
but
i
ca
have
my
bloodhounds
my
beautiful
bloodhounds
sacrificed
to
no
no
no
they
were
not
your
whose
dogs
then
the
oh
well
i
am
very
sorry
for
him
but
as
i
was
saying
i
ca
have
my
old
soldiers
sacrificed
to
his
bloodhounds
thou
shalt
have
thy
free
and
poor
and
poor
gerard
too
for
thy
sake
and
more
tell
thou
this
burgomaster
his
doings
mislike
me
this
is
to
set
up
for
a
king
not
a
burgomaster
i
have
no
kings
in
holland
but
one
bid
him
be
more
humble
or
by
jude
i
hang
him
before
his
own
door
as
i
hanged
the
burgomaster
of
what
the
name
some
town
or
other
in
flanders
it
was
no
was
somewhere
in
brabant
no
matter
i
hanged
him
i
remember
that
much
for
oppressing
poor
the
duke
then
beckoned
his
chancellor
a
pursy
old
fellow
that
rode
like
a
sack
and
bade
him
write
out
a
free
pardon
for
martin
and
one
gerard
this
precious
document
was
drawn
up
in
form
and
signed
next
day
and
martin
hastened
home
with
it
margaret
had
left
her
bed
some
days
and
was
sitting
pale
and
pensive
by
the
fireside
when
he
burst
in
waving
the
parchment
and
crying
a
free
pardon
girl
for
gerard
as
well
as
me
send
for
him
back
when
you
will
all
the
burgomasters
on
earth
dare
lay
a
finger
on
she
flushed
all
over
with
joy
and
her
hands
trembled
with
eagerness
as
she
took
the
parchment
and
devoured
it
with
her
eyes
and
kissed
it
again
and
again
and
flung
her
arms
round
martin
neck
and
kissed
him
when
she
was
calmer
she
told
him
heaven
had
raised
her
up
a
friend
in
the
dame
van
eyck
and
i
would
fain
consult
her
on
this
good
news
but
i
have
not
strength
to
walk
so
what
need
to
walk
there
is
my
your
mule
martin
the
old
soldier
or
professional
pillager
laughed
and
confessed
he
had
got
so
used
to
her
that
he
forgot
at
times
ghysbrecht
had
a
prior
claim
he
would
turn
her
into
the
burgomaster
yard
but
she
should
carry
margaret
to
tergou
it
was
nearly
dusk
so
margaret
ventured
and
about
seven
in
the
evening
she
astonished
and
gladdened
her
new
but
ardent
friend
by
arriving
at
her
house
with
unwonted
roses
on
her
cheeks
and
gerard
pardon
in
her
bosom

margaret
van
eyck
heart
was
an
evergreen
she
loved
her
young
namesake
with
youthful
ardour
nor
was
this
new
sentiment
a
mere
caprice
she
was
quick
at
reading
character
and
saw
in
margaret
brandt
that
which
in
one
of
her
own
sex
goes
far
with
an
intelligent
woman
genuineness
but
besides
her
own
sterling
qualities
margaret
had
from
the
first
a
potent
ally
in
the
old
artist
bosom
human
nature
strange
as
it
may
appear
to
the
unobservant
our
hearts
warm
more
readily
to
those
we
have
benefited
than
to
our
benefactors
some
of
the

noticed
this

stamped
it
in
immortal
lines
i
heard
and
thought
how
side
by
side
we
two
had
stemmed
the
battle
tide
in
many
a
field
where
bertram
breast
was
philip
shield
i
thought
on
darien
deserts
pale
where
death
bestrides
the
evening
gale
how
my
friend
my
cloak
i
threw
and
fenceless
faced
the
deadly
dew
i
thought
on
quariana
cliff
where
rescued
from
our
foundering
skiff
through
the
white
breakers
wrath
i
bore
exhausted
bertram
to
the
shore
and
when
his
side
an
arrow
found
i
sucked
the
indian
venom
wound
these
thoughts
like
torrents
rushed
along
to
sweep
away
my
purpose
observe
this
assassin
hand
is
stayed
by
memory
not
of
benefits
received
but
benefits
conferred
now
margaret
van
eyck
had
been
wonderfully
kind
to
margaret
brandt
had
broken
through
her
own
habits
to
go
and
see
her
had
nursed
her
and
soothed
her
and
petted
her
and
cured
her
more
than
all
the
medicine
in
the
world
so
her
heart
opened
to
the
recipient
of
her
goodness
and
she
loved
her
now
far
more
tenderly
than
she
had
ever
loved
gerard
though
in
truth
it
was
purely
out
of
regard
for
gerard
she
had
visited
her
in
the
first
instance
when
therefore
she
saw
the
roses
on
margaret
cheek
and
read
the
bit
of
parchment
that
had
brought
them
there
she
gave
up
her
own
views
without
a
murmur
sweetheart
said
she
i
did
desire
he
should
stay
in
italy
five
or
six
years
and
come
back
rich
and
above
all
an
artist
but
your
happiness
is
before
all
and
i
see
you
can
not
live
without
him
so
we
must
have
him
home
as
fast
as
may
ah
madam
you
see
my
very
and
the
young
woman
hung
her
head
a
moment
and
blushed
but
how
to
let
him
know
madam
that
passes
my
skill
he
is
gone
to
italy
but
what
part
i
know
not
stay
he
named
the
cities
he
should
visit
florence
was
one
and
but
then
finally
being
a
sensible
girl
she
divined
that
a
letter
addressed
my
gerard
italy
might
chance
to
miscarry
and
she
looked
imploringly
at
her
friend
for
counsel
you
are
come
to
the
right
place
and
at
the
right
time
said
the
old
lady
here
was
this
hans
memling
with
me
he
is
going
to
italy
girl
no
later
than
next
week
improve
his
hand
he
says
not
before
was
needed
i
do
assure
but
how
is
he
to
find
my
gerard
why
he
knows
your
gerard
child
they
have
supped
here
more
than
once
and
were
like
hand
and
glove
now
as
his
business
is
the
same
as
gerard
he
will
visit
the
same
places
as
gerard
and
soon
or
late
he
must
fall
in
with
him
wherefore
get
you
a
long
letter
written
and
copy
out
this
pardon
into
it
and
i
answer
for
the
messenger
in
six
months
at
farthest
gerard
shall
get
it
and
when
he
shall
get
it
then
will
he
kiss
it
and
put
it
in
his
bosom
and
come
flying
home
what
are
you
smiling
at
and
now
what
makes
your
cheeks
so
red
and
what
you
are
smothering
me
for
i
can
not
think
yes
happy
days
are
coming
to
my
little
meantime
martin
sat
in
the
kitchen
with
the
before
him
and
reicht
heynes
spinning
beside
him
and
wow
but
she
pumped
him
that
night
this
hans
memling
was
an
old
pupil
of
jan
van
eyck
and
his
sister
he
was
a
painter
notwithstanding
margaret
sneer
and
a
good
soul
enough
with
one
fault
he
loved
the
nipperkin
canakin
and
the
brown
bowl
more
than
they
deserve
this
singular
penchant
kept
him
from
amassing
fortune
and
was
the
cause
that
he
often
came
to
margaret
van
eyck
for
a
meal
and
sometimes
for
a
groat
but
this
gave
her
a
claim
on
him
and
she
knew
he
would
not
trifle
with
any
commission
she
should
entrust
to
him
the
letter
was
duly
written
and
left
with
margaret
van
eyck
and
the
following
week
sure
enough
hans
memling
returned
from
flanders
margaret
van
eyck
gave
him
the
letter
and
a
piece
of
gold
towards
his
travelling
expenses
he
seemed
in
a
hurry
to
be
off
all
the
better
said
the
old
artist
he
will
be
the
sooner
in
but
as
there
are
horses
who
burn
and
rage
to
start
and
after
the
first
yard
or
two
want
the
whip
so
all
this
hurry
cooled
into
inaction
when
hans
got
as
far
as
the
principal
hostelry
of
tergou
and
saw
two
of
his
boon
companions
sitting
in
the
bay
window
he
went
in
for
a
parting
glass
with
them
but
when
he
offered
to
pay
they
would
not
hear
of
it
no
he
was
going
a
long
journey
they
would
treat
him
everybody
must
treat
him
the
landlord
and
all
it
resulted
from
this
treatment
that
his
tongue
got
as
loose
as
if
the
wine
had
been
oil
and
he
confided
to
the
convivial
crew
that
he
was
going
to
show
the
italians
how
to
paint
next
he
sang
his
exploits
in
battle
for
he
had
handled
a
pike
and
his
amorous
successes
with
females
not
present
to
oppose
their
version
of
the
incidents
in
short
plenus
rimarum
erat
huc
illuc
diffluebat
and
among
the
miscellaneous
matters
that
oozed
out
he
must
blab
that
he
was
entrusted
with
a
letter
to
a
townsman
of
theirs
one
gerard
a
good
fellow
he
added
you
are
all
good
fellows
and
to
impress
his
eulogy
slapped
sybrandt
on
the
back
so
heartily
as
to
drive
the
breath
out
of
his
body
sybrandt
got
round
the
table
to
avoid
this
muscular
approval
but
listened
to
every
word
and
learned
for
the
first
time
that
gerard
was
gone
to
italy
however
to
make
sure
he
affected
to
doubt
it
my
brother
gerard
is
never
in
ye
lie
ye
cur
roared
hans
taking
instantly
the
irascible
turn
and
not
being
clear
enough
to
see
that
he
who
now
sat
opposite
him
was
the
same
he
had
praised
and
hit
when
beside
him
if
he
is
ten
times
your
brother
he
is
in
italy
what
call
ye
this
there
read
me
that
superscription
and
he
flung
down
a
letter
on
the
table
sybrandt
took
it
up
and
examined
it
gravely
but
eventually
laid
it
down
with
the
remark
that
he
could
not
read
however
one
of
the
company
by
some
immense
fortuity
could
read
and
proud
of
so
rare
an
accomplishment
took
it
and
read
it
out
to
gerard
eliassoen
of
tergou
these
by
the
hand
of
the
trusty
hans
memling
with
all
is
excellently
well
writ
said
the
reader
examining
every
letter
ay
said
hans
bombastically
and
small
wonder
is
writ
by
a
famous
hand
by
margaret
sister
of
jan
van
eyck
blessed
and
honoured
be
his
memory
she
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
is
margaret
van
miscellaneous
hans
then
diverged
into
forty
topics
sybrandt
stole
out
of
the
company
and
went
in
search
of
cornelis
they
put
their
heads
together
over
the
news
italy
was
an
immense
distance
off
if
they
could
only
keep
him
there
keep
him
there
nothing
would
keep
him
long
from
his
curse
her
said
sybrandt
why
did
she
die
when
she
was
about
it
she
die
she
would
outlive
the
pest
to
vex
and
cornelis
was
wroth
at
her
selfishness
in
not
dying
to
oblige
these
two
black
sheep
kept
putting
their
heads
together
and
tainting
each
other
worse
and
worse
till
at
last
their
corrupt
hearts
conceived
a
plan
for
keeping
gerard
in
italy
all
his
life
and
so
securing
his
share
of
their
father
substance
but
when
they
had
planned
it
they
were
no
nearer
the
execution
for
that
required
talent
so
iniquity
came
to
a
standstill
but
presently
as
if
satan
had
come
between
the
two
heads
and
whispered
into
the
right
ear
of
one
and
the
left
of
the
other
simultaneously
they
both
burst
out
the
burgomaster
they
went
to
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
and
he
received
them
at
once
for
the
man
who
is
under
the
torture
of
suspense
catches
eagerly
at
knowledge
certainty
is
often
painful
but
seldom
like
suspense
intolerable
you
have
news
of
gerard
said
he
eagerly
then
they
told
about
the
letter
and
hans
memling
he
listened
with
restless
eye
who
writ
the
letter
margaret
van
eyck
was
the
reply
for
they
naturally
thought
the
contents
were
by
the
same
hand
as
the
superscription
are
ye
sure
and
he
went
to
a
drawer
and
drew
out
a
paper
written
by
margaret
van
eyck
while
treating
with
the
burgh
for
her
house
was
it
writ
like
this
yes
is
the
same
writing
said
sybrandt
boldly
good
and
now
what
would
ye
of
me
said
ghysbrecht
with
beating
heart
but
a
carelessness
so
well
feigned
that
it
staggered
them
they
fumbled
with
their
bonnets
and
stammered
and
spoke
a
word
or
two
then
hesitated
and
beat
about
the
bush
and
let
out
by
degrees
that
they
wanted
a
letter
written
to
say
something
that
might
keep
gerard
in
italy
and
this
letter
they
proposed
to
substitute
in
hans
wallet
for
the
one
he
carried
while
these
fumbled
with
their
bonnets
and
their
iniquity
and
vacillated
between
respect
for
a
burgomaster
and
suspicion
that
this
one
was
as
great
a
rogue
as
themselves
and
somehow
or
other
on
their
side
against
gerard
pros
and
cons
were
coursing
one
another
to
and
fro
in
the
keen
old
man
spirit
vengeance
said
let
gerard
come
back
and
feel
the
weight
of
the
law
prudence
said
keep
him
a
thousand
miles
off
but
then
prudence
said
also
why
do
dirty
work
on
a
doubtful
chance
why
put
it
in
the
power
of
these
two
rogues
to
tarnish
your
name
finally
his
strong
persuasion
that
gerard
was
in
possession
of
a
secret
by
means
of
which
he
could
wound
him
to
the
quick
coupled
with
his
caution
found
words
thus
it
is
my
duty
to
aid
the
citizens
that
can
not
write
but
for
their
matter
i
will
not
be
responsible
tell
me
then
what
i
shall
something
about
this
ay
ay
that
she
is
false
that
she
is
married
to
another
i
go
nay
burgomaster
nay
not
for
all
the
world
cried
sybrandt
gerard
would
not
believe
it
or
but
half
and
then
he
would
come
back
to
see
no
say
that
she
is
dead
what
at
her
age
will
he
credit
that
sooner
than
the
other
why
she
was
nearly
dead
so
it
is
not
to
say
a
downright
lie
after
humph
and
you
think
that
will
keep
him
in
italy
we
are
sure
of
it
are
we
not
cornelis
ay
said
cornelis
our
gerard
will
never
leave
italy
now
he
is
there
it
was
always
his
dream
to
get
there
he
would
come
back
for
his
margaret
but
not
for
us
what
cares
he
for
us
he
despises
his
own
family
always
this
would
be
a
bitter
pill
to
him
said
the
old
hypocrite
it
will
be
for
his
good
in
the
end
replied
the
young
one
what
avails
famine
wedding
thirst
said
cornelis
and
the
grief
you
are
preparing
for
him
so
coolly
ghysbrecht
spoke
sarcastically
but
tasted
his
own
vengeance
all
the
time
oh
a
lie
is
not
like
a
blow
with
a
curtal
axe
it
hacks
no
flesh
and
breaks
no
a
curtal
axe
said
sybrandt
no
nor
even
like
a
stroke
with
a
and
he
shot
a
sly
envenomed
glance
at
the
burgomaster
broken
nose
ghysbrecht
face
darkened
with
ire
when
this
adder
tongue
struck
his
wound
but
it
told
as
intended
the
old
man
bristled
with
hate
well
said
he
tell
me
what
to
write
for
you
and
i
must
write
it
but
take
notice
you
bear
the
blame
if
aught
turns
amiss
not
the
hand
which
writes
but
the
tongue
which
dictates
doth
the
the
brothers
assented
warmly
sneering
within
ghysbrecht
then
drew
his
inkhorn
towards
him
and
laid
the
specimen
of
margaret
van
writing
before
him
and
made
some
inquiries
as
to
the
size
and
shape
of
the
letter
when
an
interruption
occurred
jorian
ketel
burst
hastily
into
the
room
and
looked
vexed
at
not
finding
him
alone
thou
seest
i
have
matter
on
hand
good
ay
but
this
is
grave
i
bring
good
news
but
is
not
for
every
the
burgomaster
rose
and
drew
jorian
aside
into
the
embrasure
of
his
deep
window
and
then
the
brothers
heard
them
converse
in
low
but
eager
tones
it
ended
by
ghysbrecht
sending
jorian
out
to
saddle
his
mule
he
then
addressed
the
black
sheep
with
a
sudden
coldness
that
amazed
them
i
prize
the
peace
of
households
but
this
is
not
a
thing
to
be
done
in
a
hurry
we
will
see
about
it
we
will
but
burgomaster
the
man
will
be
gone
it
will
be
too
where
is
he
at
the
hostelry
well
keep
him
drinking
we
will
see
we
will
and
he
sent
them
off
discomfited
to
explain
all
this
we
must
retrograde
a
step
this
very
morning
then
margaret
brandt
had
met
jorian
ketel
near
her
own
door
he
passed
her
with
a
scowl
this
struck
her
and
she
remembered
him
stay
said
she
yes
it
is
the
good
man
who
saved
him
oh
why
have
you
not
been
near
me
since
and
why
have
you
not
come
for
the
parchments
was
it
not
true
about
the
hundred
crowns
jorian
gave
a
snort
but
seeing
her
face
that
looked
so
candid
began
to
think
there
might
be
some
mistake
he
told
her
he
had
come
and
how
he
had
been
received
alas
said
she
i
knew
nought
of
this
i
lay
at
death
door
she
then
invited
him
to
follow
her
and
took
him
into
the
garden
and
showed
him
the
spot
where
the
parchments
were
buried
martin
was
for
taking
them
up
but
i
would
not
let
him
he
put
them
there
and
i
said
none
should
move
them
but
you
who
had
earned
them
so
well
of
him
and
give
me
a
spade
cried
jorian
eagerly
but
stay
no
he
is
a
suspicious
man
you
are
sure
they
are
there
still
i
will
openly
take
the
blame
if
human
hand
hath
touched
then
keep
them
but
two
hours
more
i
prithee
good
margaret
said
jorian
and
ran
off
to
the
stadthouse
of
tergou
a
joyful
man
the
burgomaster
jogged
along
towards
sevenbergen
with
jorian
striding
beside
him
giving
him
assurance
that
in
an
hour
time
the
missing
parchments
would
be
in
his
hand
ah
master
said
he
lucky
for
us
it
was
a
thief
that
took
not
a
thief
not
a
thief
what
call
you
him
then
well
saving
your
presence
i
call
him
a
jackdaw
this
is
work
if
ever
there
was
the
thing
you
are
least
in
need
of
and
hide
it
that
a
jackdaw
i
should
know
added
jorian
oracularly
for
i
was
brought
up
along
with
a
chough
he
and
i
were
born
the
same
year
but
he
cut
his
teeth
long
before
me
and
wow
but
my
life
was
a
burden
for
years
all
along
of
him
if
you
had
but
a
hole
in
your
hose
no
bigger
than
a
groat
in
went
his
beak
like
a
gimlet
and
for
stealing
gerard
all
over
what
he
wanted
least
and
any
poor
christian
in
the
house
wanted
most
that
went
first
mother
was
a
notable
woman
so
if
she
did
but
look
round
away
flew
her
thimble
father
lived
by
cordwaining
so
about
sunrise
jack
went
diligently
off
with
his
awl
his
wax
and
his
twine
after
that
make
your
bread
how
you
could
one
day
i
heard
my
mother
tell
him
to
his
face
he
was
enough
to
corrupt
other
children
and
he
only
cocked
his
eye
at
her
and
next
minute
away
with
the
nurseling
shoe
off
his
very
foot
now
this
gerard
is
tarred
with
the
same
stick
the
parchments
are
no
more
use
to
him
than
a
thimble
or
an
awl
to
jack
he
took
out
of
pure
mischief
and
hid
them
and
you
would
never
have
found
them
but
for
i
believe
you
are
right
said
ghysbrecht
and
i
have
vexed
myself
more
than
when
they
came
to
peter
gate
he
felt
uneasy
i
wish
it
had
been
anywhere
but
jorian
reassured
him
the
girl
is
honest
and
friendly
said
he
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
taking
them
i
be
sworn
and
he
led
him
into
the
garden
there
master
if
a
face
is
to
be
believed
here
they
lie
and
see
the
mould
is
he
ran
for
a
spade
which
was
stuck
up
in
the
ground
at
some
distance
and
soon
went
to
work
and
uncovered
a
parchment
ghysbrecht
saw
it
and
thrust
him
aside
and
went
down
on
his
knees
and
tore
it
out
of
the
hole
his
hands
trembled
and
his
face
shone
he
threw
out
parchment
after
parchment
and
jorian
dusted
them
and
cleared
them
and
shook
them
now
when
ghysbrecht
had
thrown
out
a
great
many
his
face
began
to
darken
and
lengthen
and
when
he
came
to
the
last
he
put
his
hands
to
his
temples
and
seemed
to
be
all
amazed
what
mystery
lies
here
he
gasped
are
fiends
mocking
me
dig
deeper
there
must
be
jorian
drove
the
spade
in
and
threw
out
quantities
of
hard
mould
in
vain
and
even
while
he
dug
his
master
mood
had
changed
treason
treachery
he
cried
you
knew
of
knew
what
master
in
heaven
name
caitiff
you
knew
there
was
another
one
worth
all
these
twice
told
is
false
cried
jorian
made
suspicious
by
the
other
suspicion
is
a
trick
to
rob
me
of
my
hundred
crowns
oh
i
know
you
and
jorian
was
ready
to
whimper
a
mellow
voice
fell
on
them
both
like
oil
upon
the
waves
no
good
man
it
is
not
false
nor
yet
is
it
quite
true
there
was
another
there
there
there
where
is
it
but
continued
margaret
calmly
it
was
not
a
town
record
so
you
have
gained
your
hundred
crowns
good
man
it
was
but
a
private
deed
between
the
burgomaster
here
and
my
grandfather
flor
hush
hush
is
where
is
it
girl
that
is
all
we
want
to
have
patience
and
i
shall
tell
you
gerard
read
the
title
of
it
and
he
said
is
as
much
yours
as
the
burgomaster
and
he
put
it
apart
to
read
it
with
me
at
his
it
is
in
the
house
then
said
the
burgomaster
recovering
his
calmness
no
sir
said
margaret
gravely
it
is
then
in
a
voice
that
faltered
suddenly
you
hunted
my
poor
gerard
so
hard
and
so
you
gave
him
no
think
of
aught
but
his
life
and
his
grief
the
parchment
was
in
his
bosom
and
he
hath
it
with
whither
whither
ask
me
no
more
sir
what
right
is
yours
to
question
me
thus
it
was
for
your
sake
good
man
i
put
force
upon
my
heart
and
came
out
here
and
bore
to
speak
at
all
to
this
hard
old
man
for
when
i
think
of
the
misery
he
has
brought
on
him
and
me
the
sight
of
him
is
more
than
i
can
bear
and
she
gave
an
involuntary
shudder
and
went
slowly
in
with
her
hand
to
her
head
crying
bitterly
remorse
for
the
past
and
dread
of
the
future
the
slow
but
as
he
now
felt
the
inevitable
future
avarice
and
fear
all
tugged
in
one
short
moment
at
ghysbrecht
tough
heart
he
hung
his
head
and
his
arms
fell
listless
by
his
sides
a
coarse
chuckle
made
him
start
round
and
there
stood
martin
wittenhaagen
leaning
on
his
bow
and
sneering
from
ear
to
ear
at
sight
of
the
man
and
his
grinning
face
ghysbrecht
worst
passions
awoke
ho
attach
him
seize
him
traitor
and
thief
cried
he
dog
thou
shalt
pay
for
martin
without
a
word
calmly
thrust
the
duke
pardon
under
ghysbrecht
nose
he
looked
and
had
not
a
word
to
say
martin
followed
up
his
advantage
the
duke
and
i
are
soldiers
he
wo
let
you
greasy
burghers
trample
on
an
old
comrade
he
bade
me
carry
you
a
message
the
duke
send
a
message
to
me
ay
i
told
him
of
your
masterful
doings
of
your
imprisoning
gerard
for
loving
a
girl
and
says
he
him
this
is
to
be
a
king
not
a
burgomaster
i
have
no
kings
in
holland
but
one
bid
him
be
more
humble
or
i
hang
him
at
his
own
door
ghysbrecht
trembled
he
thought
the
duke
capable
of
the
deed
i
hanged
the
burgomaster
of
thingembob
the
duke
could
not
mind
which
of
you
he
had
hung
or
in
what
part
such
trifles
stick
not
in
a
soldier
memory
but
he
was
sure
he
had
hanged
one
of
you
for
grinding
poor
folk
i
the
man
to
hang
another
quoth
the
good
these
repeated
insults
from
so
mean
a
man
coupled
with
his
invulnerability
shielded
as
he
was
by
the
duke
drove
the
choleric
old
man
into
a
fit
of
impotent
fury
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
soldier
and
tried
to
threaten
him
but
could
not
speak
for
the
rage
and
mortification
that
choked
him
then
he
gave
a
sort
of
screech
and
coiled
himself
up
in
eye
and
form
like
a
rattlesnake
about
to
strike
and
spat
furiously
upon
martin
doublet
the
soldier
treated
this
ebullition
with
genuine
contempt
here
a
venomous
old
toad
he
knows
a
kick
from
his
foot
would
send
him
to
his
last
home
and
he
wants
me
to
cheat
the
gallows
but
i
have
slain
too
many
men
in
fair
fight
to
lift
limb
against
anything
less
than
a
man
and
this
i
count
no
man
what
is
it
in
heaven
name
an
old
bag
full
o
rotten
my
mule
my
mule
screamed
ghysbrecht
jorian
helped
the
old
man
up
trembling
in
every
joint
once
in
the
saddle
he
seemed
to
gather
in
a
moment
unnatural
vigour
and
the
figure
that
went
flying
to
tergou
was
truly
and
terrible
so
old
and
wizened
the
face
so
white
and
reverend
the
streaming
hair
so
baleful
the
eye
so
fierce
the
fury
which
shook
the
bent
frame
that
went
spurring
like
mad
while
the
quavering
voice
yelled
i
make
their
hearts
ache
i
make
their
hearts
ache
i
make
their
hearts
ache
i
make
their
hearts
ache
all
of
them
all
all
all
the
black
sheep
sat
disconsolate
amidst
the
convivial
crew
and
eyed
hans
memling
wallet
for
more
ease
he
had
taken
it
off
and
flung
it
on
the
table
how
readily
they
could
have
slipped
out
that
letter
and
put
in
another
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
they
were
sorry
they
had
not
learned
to
write
like
their
brother
and
now
hans
began
to
talk
of
going
and
the
brothers
agreed
in
a
whisper
to
abandon
their
project
for
the
time
they
had
scarcely
resolved
this
when
dierich
brower
stood
suddenly
in
the
doorway
and
gave
them
a
wink
they
went
out
to
him
come
to
the
burgomaster
with
all
speed
said
he
they
found
ghysbrecht
seated
at
a
table
pale
and
agitated
before
him
lay
margaret
van
eyck
handwriting
i
have
written
what
you
desired
said
he
now
for
the
superscription
what
were
the
words
did
ye
see
we
can
not
read
said
cornelis
then
is
all
this
labour
lost
cried
ghysbrecht
angrily
dolts
nay
but
said
sybrandt
i
heard
the
words
read
and
i
have
not
lost
them
they
were
gerard
eliassoen
these
by
the
hand
of
the
trusty
hans
memling
with
all
speed
is
well
now
how
was
the
letter
folded
how
big
was
it
longer
than
that
one
and
not
so
long
as
is
well
where
is
he
at
the
come
then
take
you
this
groat
and
treat
him
then
ask
to
see
the
letter
and
put
this
in
place
of
it
come
to
me
with
the
other
the
brothers
assented
took
the
letter
and
went
to
the
hostelry
they
had
not
been
gone
a
minute
when
dierich
brower
issued
from
the
stadthouse
and
followed
them
he
had
his
orders
not
to
let
them
out
of
his
sight
till
the
true
letter
was
in
his
master
hands
he
watched
outside
the
hostelry
he
had
not
long
to
wait
they
came
out
almost
immediately
with
downcast
looks
dierich
made
up
to
them
too
late
they
cried
too
late
he
is
gone
how
long
scarce
five
minutes
cursed
chance
you
must
go
back
to
the
burgomaster
at
once
said
dierich
brower
to
what
end
no
matter
come
and
he
hurried
them
to
the
stadthouse
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
was
not
the
man
to
accept
a
defeat
well
said
he
on
hearing
the
ill
news
suppose
he
is
gone
is
he
mounted
then
what
hinders
you
to
come
up
with
him
but
what
avails
coming
up
with
him
there
are
no
hostelries
on
the
road
he
is
fools
said
ghysbrecht
is
there
no
way
of
emptying
a
man
pockets
but
liquor
and
sleight
of
hand
a
meaning
look
that
passed
between
ghysbrecht
and
dierich
aided
the
brothers
comprehension
they
changed
colour
and
lost
all
zeal
for
the
business
no
no
we
do
hate
our
brother
we
wo
get
ourselves
hanged
to
spite
him
said
sybrandt
that
would
be
a
fool
hanged
cried
ghysbrecht
am
i
not
the
burgomaster
how
can
ye
be
hanged
i
see
how
is
ye
fear
to
tackle
one
man
being
two
hearts
of
hare
that
ye
are
oh
why
can
not
i
be
young
again
i
do
it
the
old
man
now
threw
off
all
disguise
and
showed
them
his
heart
was
in
this
deed
he
then
flattered
and
besought
and
jeered
them
alternately
but
he
found
no
eloquence
could
move
them
to
an
action
however
dishonourable
which
was
attended
with
danger
at
last
he
opened
a
drawer
and
showed
them
a
pile
of
silver
coins
change
but
those
letters
for
me
he
said
and
each
of
you
shall
thrust
one
hand
into
this
drawer
and
take
away
as
many
of
them
as
you
can
the
effect
was
magical
their
eyes
glittered
with
desire
their
whole
bodies
seemed
to
swell
and
rise
into
male
energy
swear
it
then
said
sybrandt
i
swear
no
on
the
ghysbrecht
swore
upon
the
crucifix
the
next
minute
the
brothers
were
on
the
road
in
pursuit
of
hans
memling
they
came
in
sight
of
him
about
two
leagues
from
tergou
but
though
they
knew
he
had
no
weapon
but
his
staff
they
were
too
prudent
to
venture
on
him
in
daylight
so
they
fell
back
but
being
now
three
leagues
and
more
from
the
town
and
on
a
grassy
road
sun
down
moon
not
yet
up
honest
hans
suddenly
found
himself
attacked
before
and
behind
at
once
by
men
with
uplifted
knives
who
cried
in
loud
though
somewhat
shaky
voices
stand
and
deliver
the
attack
was
so
sudden
and
so
well
planned
that
hans
was
dismayed
slay
me
not
good
fellows
he
cried
i
am
but
a
poor
man
and
ye
shall
have
my
so
be
it
then
live
but
empty
thy
there
is
nought
in
my
wallet
good
friend
but
one
that
we
shall
see
said
sybrandt
who
was
the
one
in
front
well
it
is
a
take
it
not
from
me
i
pray
you
is
worth
nought
and
the
good
dame
would
fret
that
writ
there
said
sybrandt
take
back
thy
letter
and
now
empty
thy
pouch
come
i
tarry
not
but
by
this
time
hans
had
recovered
his
confusion
and
from
a
certain
flutter
in
sybrandt
and
hard
breathing
of
cornelis
aided
by
an
indescribable
consciousness
felt
sure
the
pair
he
had
to
deal
with
were
no
heroes
he
pretended
to
fumble
for
his
money
then
suddenly
thrust
his
staff
fiercely
into
sybrandt
face
and
drove
him
staggering
and
lent
cornelis
a
slash
on
the
ear
that
sent
him
twirling
like
a
weathercock
in
march
then
whirled
his
weapon
over
his
head
and
danced
about
the
road
like
a
figure
on
springs
shouting
come
on
ye
thieving
loons
come
on
it
was
a
plain
invitation
yet
they
misunderstood
it
so
utterly
as
to
take
to
their
heels
with
hans
after
them
he
shouting
stop
thieves
and
they
howling
with
fear
and
pain
as
they
ran
chapter
xli
denys
placed
in
the
middle
of
his
companions
lest
he
should
be
so
mad
as
attempt
escape
was
carried
off
in
an
agony
of
grief
and
remorse
for
his
sake
gerard
had
abandoned
the
german
route
to
rome
and
what
was
his
reward
left
all
alone
in
the
centre
of
burgundy
this
was
the
thought
which
maddened
denys
most
and
made
him
now
rave
at
heaven
and
earth
now
fall
into
a
gloomy
silence
so
savage
and
sinister
that
it
was
deemed
prudent
to
disarm
him
they
caught
up
their
leader
just
outside
the
town
and
the
whole
cavalcade
drew
up
and
baited
at
the
tete
the
young
landlady
though
much
occupied
with
the
count
and
still
more
with
the
bastard
caught
sight
of
denys
and
asked
him
somewhat
anxiously
what
had
become
of
his
young
companion
denys
with
a
burst
of
grief
told
her
all
and
prayed
her
to
send
after
gerard
now
he
is
parted
from
me
he
will
maybe
listen
to
my
rede
said
he
poor
wretch
he
loves
not
the
landlady
gave
a
toss
of
her
head
i
trow
i
have
been
somewhat
already
said
she
and
turned
rather
red
you
will
not
not
then
and
he
poured
a
volley
of
curses
and
abuse
upon
her
she
turned
her
back
upon
him
and
went
off
whimpering
and
saying
she
was
not
used
to
be
cursed
at
and
ordered
her
hind
to
saddle
two
mules
denys
went
north
with
his
troop
mute
and
drooping
over
his
saddle
and
quite
unknown
to
him
that
veracious
young
lady
made
an
equestrian
toilet
in
only
forty
minutes
she
being
really
in
a
hurry
and
spurred
away
with
her
servant
in
the
opposite
direction
at
dark
after
a
long
march
the
bastard
and
his
men
reached
the
white
hart
their
arrival
caused
a
prodigious
bustle
and
it
was
some
time
before
manon
discovered
her
old
friend
among
so
many
when
she
did
she
showed
it
only
by
heightened
colour
she
did
not
claim
the
acquaintance
the
poor
soul
was
already
beginning
to
scorn
the
base
degrees
by
which
she
did
denys
saw
but
could
not
smile
the
inn
reminded
him
too
much
of
gerard
ere
the
night
closed
the
wind
changed
she
looked
into
the
room
and
beckoned
him
with
her
finger
he
rose
sulkily
and
his
guards
with
him
nay
i
would
speak
a
word
to
thee
in
she
drew
him
to
a
corner
of
the
room
and
there
asked
him
under
her
breath
would
he
do
her
a
kindness
he
answered
out
loud
no
he
would
not
he
was
not
in
the
vein
to
do
kindnesses
to
man
or
woman
if
he
did
a
kindness
it
should
be
to
a
dog
and
not
that
if
he
could
help
alas
good
archer
i
did
you
one
eftsoons
you
and
your
pretty
comrade
said
manon
humbly
you
did
dame
you
did
well
then
for
his
sake
what
to
do
thou
knowest
my
story
i
had
been
unfortunate
now
i
am
worshipful
but
a
woman
did
cast
him
in
my
teeth
this
day
and
so
be
ever
while
he
hangs
there
i
would
have
him
down
with
all
my
and
none
dare
i
ask
but
thee
wilt
not
i
even
were
i
not
a
on
this
stern
refusal
the
tender
manon
sighed
and
clasped
her
palms
together
despondently
denys
told
her
she
need
not
fret
there
were
soldiers
of
a
lower
stamp
who
would
not
make
two
bites
of
such
a
cherry
it
was
a
mere
matter
of
money
if
she
could
find
two
angels
he
would
find
two
soldiers
to
do
the
dirty
work
of
the
white
this
was
not
very
palatable
however
reflecting
that
soldiers
were
birds
of
passage
drinking
here
knocked
on
the
head
there
she
said
softly
send
them
out
to
me
but
prithee
tell
them
that
is
for
one
that
is
my
friend
let
them
not
think
is
for
me
i
should
sink
into
the
earth
times
are
denys
found
warriors
glad
to
win
an
angel
apiece
so
easily
he
sent
them
out
and
instantly
dismissing
the
subject
with
contempt
sat
brooding
on
his
lost
friend
manon
and
the
warriors
soon
came
to
a
general
understanding
but
what
were
they
to
do
with
the
body
when
taken
down
she
murmured
the
river
is
nigh
the
the
fling
him
in
eh
nay
nay
be
not
so
cruel
could
ye
not
put
him
gently
and
with
somewhat
weighty
she
must
have
been
thinking
on
the
subject
in
detail
for
she
was
not
one
to
whom
ideas
came
quickly
all
was
speedily
agreed
except
the
time
of
payment
the
itched
for
it
and
sought
it
in
advance
manon
demurred
to
that
what
did
she
doubt
their
word
then
let
her
come
along
with
them
or
watch
them
at
a
distance
me
said
manon
with
horror
i
would
liever
die
than
see
it
which
yet
you
would
have
ay
for
sore
is
my
need
times
are
she
had
already
forgotten
her
precept
to
denys
an
hour
later
the
disagreeable
relic
of
caterpillar
existence
ceased
to
canker
the
worshipful
matron
public
life
and
the
grim
eyes
of
the
past
to
cast
malignant
glances
down
into
a
white
hind
clover
field
total
she
made
the
landlord
an
average
wife
and
a
prime
and
outlived
everybody
her
troops
when
they
returned
from
executing
with
mediaeval
naivete
the
precept
off
wi
the
auld
love
received
a
shock
they
found
the
black
with
groups
it
had
been
empty
an
hour
ago
conscience
smote
them
this
came
of
meddling
with
the
dead
however
the
bolder
of
the
two
encouraged
by
the
darkness
stole
forward
alone
and
slily
mingled
with
a
group
he
soon
returned
to
his
companion
saying
in
a
tone
of
reproach
not
strictly
reasonable
ye
born
fool
it
is
only
a
chapter
xlii
letters
of
fire
on
the
church
wall
had
just
inquired
with
an
appearance
of
genuine
curiosity
why
there
was
no
mass
for
the
duke
in
this
time
of
trouble
the
supernatural
expostulation
had
been
seen
by
many
and
had
gradually
faded
leaving
the
spectators
glued
there
gaping
the
upshot
was
that
the
corporation
not
choosing
to
be
behind
the
angelic
powers
in
loyalty
to
a
temporal
sovereign
invested
freely
in
masses
by
this
an
old
friend
of
ours
the
cure
profited
in
hard
cash
for
which
he
had
a
very
pretty
taste
but
for
this
i
would
not
of
course
have
detained
you
over
so
trite
an
occurrence
as
a
miracle
denys
begged
for
his
arms
why
disgrace
him
as
well
as
break
his
heart
then
swear
on
the
cross
of
thy
sword
not
to
leave
the
bastard
service
until
the
sedition
shall
be
put
he
yielded
to
necessity
and
delivered
three
volleys
of
oaths
and
recovered
his
arms
and
liberty
the
troops
halted
at
the
three
fish
and
marion
at
sight
of
him
cried
out
i
out
of
luck
who
would
have
thought
to
see
you
again
then
seeing
he
was
sad
and
rather
hurt
than
amused
at
this
blunt
jest
she
asked
him
what
was
amiss
he
told
her
she
took
a
bright
view
of
the
case
gerard
was
too
handsome
and
to
come
to
harm
the
women
too
would
always
be
on
his
side
moreover
it
was
clear
that
things
must
either
go
well
or
ill
with
him
in
the
former
case
he
would
strike
in
with
some
good
company
going
to
rome
in
the
latter
he
would
return
home
perhaps
be
there
before
his
friend
for
you
have
a
trifle
of
fighting
to
do
in
flanders
by
all
she
then
brought
him
his
gold
pieces
and
steadily
refused
to
accept
one
though
he
urged
her
again
and
again
denys
was
somewhat
convinced
by
her
argument
because
she
concurred
with
his
own
wishes
and
was
also
cheered
a
little
by
finding
her
so
honest
it
made
him
think
a
little
better
of
that
world
in
which
his
poor
little
friend
was
walking
alone
foot
soldiers
in
small
bodies
down
to
twos
and
threes
were
already
on
the
road
making
lazily
towards
flanders
many
of
them
penniless
but
passed
from
town
to
town
by
the
bailiffs
with
orders
for
food
and
lodging
on
the
innkeepers
anthony
of
burgundy
overtook
numbers
of
these
and
gathered
them
under
his
standard
so
that
he
entered
flanders
at
the
head
of
six
hundred
men
on
crossing
the
frontier
he
was
met
by
his
brother
baldwyn
with
men
arms
and
provisions
he
organized
his
whole
force
and
marched
on
in
battle
array
through
several
towns
not
only
without
impediment
but
with
great
acclamations
this
loyalty
called
forth
comments
not
altogether
gracious
this
rebellion
of
ours
is
a
bite
growled
a
soldier
called
simon
who
had
elected
himself
denys
comrade
denys
said
nothing
but
made
a
little
vow
to
mars
to
shoot
this
anthony
of
burgundy
dead
should
the
rebellion
that
had
cost
him
gerard
prove
no
rebellion
that
afternoon
they
came
in
sight
of
a
strongly
fortified
town
and
a
whisper
went
through
the
little
army
that
this
was
a
disaffected
place
but
when
they
came
in
sight
the
great
gate
stood
open
and
the
towers
that
flanked
it
on
each
side
were
manned
with
a
single
sentinel
apiece
so
the
advancing
force
somewhat
broke
their
array
and
marched
carelessly
when
they
were
within
a
furlong
the
drawbridge
across
the
moat
rose
slowly
and
creaking
till
it
stood
vertical
against
the
fort
and
the
very
moment
it
settled
into
this
warlike
attitude
down
rattled
the
portcullis
at
the
gate
and
the
towers
and
curtains
bristled
with
lances
and
crossbows
a
stern
hum
ran
through
the
bastard
front
rank
and
spread
to
the
rear
halt
cried
he
the
word
went
down
the
line
and
they
halted
herald
to
the
gate
a
pursuivant
spurred
out
of
the
ranks
and
halting
twenty
yards
from
the
gate
raised
his
bugle
with
his
herald
flag
hanging
down
round
it
and
blew
a
summons
a
tall
figure
in
brazen
armour
appeared
over
the
gate
a
few
fiery
words
passed
between
him
and
the
herald
which
were
not
audible
but
their
import
clear
for
the
herald
blew
a
single
keen
and
threatening
note
at
the
walls
and
came
galloping
back
with
war
in
his
face
the
bastard
moved
out
of
the
line
to
meet
him
and
their
heads
had
not
been
together
two
seconds
ere
he
turned
in
his
saddle
and
shouted
pioneers
to
the
van
and
in
a
moment
hedges
were
levelled
and
the
force
took
the
field
and
encamped
just
out
of
shot
from
the
walls
and
away
went
mounted
officers
flying
south
east
and
west
to
the
friendly
towns
for
catapults
palisades
mantelets
raw
hides
carpenters
provisions
and
all
the
materials
for
a
siege
the
bright
perspective
mightily
cheered
one
drooping
soldier
at
the
first
clang
of
the
portcullis
his
eyes
brightened
and
his
temple
flushed
and
when
the
herald
came
back
with
battle
in
his
eye
he
saw
it
in
a
moment
and
for
the
first
time
this
many
days
cried
courage
tout
le
monde
le
diable
est
if
that
great
warrior
heard
how
he
must
have
grinned
the
besiegers
encamped
a
furlong
from
the
walls
and
made
roads
kept
their
pikemen
in
camp
ready
for
an
assault
when
practicable
and
sent
forward
their
sappers
pioneers
catapultiers
and
crossbowmen
these
opened
a
siege
by
filling
the
moat
and
mining
or
breaching
the
wall
etc
and
as
much
of
their
work
had
to
be
done
under
close
fire
of
arrows
quarels
bolts
stones
and
little
rocks
the
above
artists
had
need
of
a
hundred
eyes
and
acted
in
concert
with
a
vigilance
and
an
amount
of
individual
intelligence
daring
and
skill
that
made
a
siege
very
interesting
and
even
amusing
to
lookers
on
the
first
thing
they
did
was
to
advance
their
carpenters
behind
rolling
mantelets
to
erect
a
stockade
high
and
strong
on
the
very
edge
of
the
moat
some
lives
were
lost
at
this
but
not
many
for
a
strong
force
of
crossbowmen
including
denys
rolled
their
mantelets
up
and
shot
over
the
workmen
heads
at
every
besieged
who
showed
his
nose
and
at
every
loophole
or
other
aperture
which
commanded
the
particular
spot
the
carpenters
happened
to
be
upon
covered
by
their
condensed
fire
these
soon
raised
a
high
palisade
between
them
and
the
ordinary
missiles
from
the
pierced
masonry
but
the
besieged
expected
this
and
ran
out
at
night
their
boards
or
wooden
penthouses
on
the
top
of
the
curtains
the
curtains
were
built
with
square
holes
near
the
top
to
receive
the
beams
that
supported
these
structures
the
true
defence
of
mediaeval
forts
from
which
the
besieged
delivered
their
missiles
with
far
more
freedom
and
variety
of
range
than
they
could
shoot
through
the
oblique
but
immovable
loopholes
of
the
curtain
or
even
through
the
sloping
crenelets
of
the
higher
towers
on
this
the
besiegers
brought
up
mangonels
and
set
them
hurling
huge
stones
at
these
woodworks
and
battering
them
to
pieces
contemporaneously
they
built
a
triangular
wooden
tower
as
high
as
the
curtain
and
kept
it
ready
for
use
and
just
out
of
shot
this
was
a
terrible
sight
to
the
besieged
these
wooden
towers
had
taken
many
a
town
they
began
to
mine
underneath
that
part
of
the
moat
the
tower
stood
frowning
at
and
made
other
preparations
to
give
it
a
warm
reception
the
besiegers
also
mined
but
at
another
part
their
object
being
to
get
under
the
square
barbican
and
throw
it
down
all
this
time
denys
was
behind
his
mantelet
with
another
arbalestrier
protecting
the
workmen
and
making
some
excellent
shots
these
ended
by
earning
him
the
esteem
of
an
unseen
archer
who
every
now
and
then
sent
a
winged
compliment
quivering
into
his
mantelet
one
came
and
struck
within
an
inch
of
the
narrow
slit
through
which
denys
was
squinting
at
the
moment
peste
cried
he
you
shoot
well
my
friend
come
forth
and
receive
my
congratulations
shall
merit
such
as
thine
hide
its
head
comrade
it
is
one
of
those
cursed
englishmen
with
his
half
ell
shaft
i
not
die
till
i
had
a
shot
at
london
on
the
side
of
the
besieged
was
a
figure
that
soon
attracted
great
notice
by
promenading
under
fire
it
was
a
tall
knight
clad
in
complete
brass
and
carrying
a
light
but
prodigiously
long
lance
with
which
he
directed
the
movements
of
the
besieged
and
when
any
disaster
befell
the
besiegers
this
tall
knight
and
his
long
lance
were
pretty
sure
to
be
concerned
in
it
my
young
reader
will
say
why
did
not
denys
shoot
him
denys
did
shoot
him
every
day
of
his
life
other
arbalestriers
shot
him
archers
shot
him
everybody
shot
him
he
was
there
to
be
shot
apparently
but
the
abomination
was
he
did
not
mind
being
shot
nay
worse
he
got
at
last
so
demoralised
as
not
to
seem
to
know
when
he
was
shot
he
walked
his
battlements
under
fire
as
some
stout
skipper
paces
his
deck
in
a
suit
of
flushing
calmly
oblivious
of
the
april
drops
that
fall
on
his
woollen
armour
at
last
the
besiegers
got
spiteful
and
would
not
waste
any
more
good
steel
on
him
but
cursed
him
and
his
impervious
coat
of
mail
he
took
those
missiles
like
the
rest
gunpowder
has
spoiled
war
war
was
always
detrimental
to
the
solid
interests
of
mankind
but
in
old
times
it
was
good
for
something
it
painted
well
sang
divinely
furnished
iliads
but
invisible
butchery
under
a
pall
of
smoke
a
furlong
thick
who
is
any
the
better
for
that
poet
with
his
may
repeat
suave
etiam
belli
certamina
magna
tueri
but
the
sentiment
is
hollow
and
savours
of
cuckoo
you
tueri
anything
but
a
horrid
row
he
did
say
suave
etiam
ingentem

tueri
per
campos
they
managed
better
in
the
middle
ages
this
siege
was
a
small
affair
but
such
as
it
was
a
writer
or
minstrel
could
see
it
and
turn
an
honest
penny
by
singing
it
so
far
then
the
sport
was
reasonable
and
served
an
end
it
was
a
bright
day
clear
but
not
quite
frosty
the
efforts
of
the
besieging
force
were
concentrated
against
a
space
of
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
yards
containing
two
curtains
and
two
towers
one
of
which
was
the
square
barbican
the
other
had
a
pointed
roof
that
was
built
to
overlap
resting
on
a
stone
machicolade
and
by
this
means
a
row
of
dangerous
crenelets
between
the
roof
and
the
masonry
grinned
down
at
the
nearer
assailants
and
looked
not
very
unlike
the
grinders
of
a
modern
frigate
with
each
port
nearly
closed
the
curtains
were
overlapped
with
penthouses
somewhat
shattered
by
the
mangonels
trebuchets
and
other
slinging
engines
of
the
besiegers
on
the
besiegers
edge
of
the
moat
was
what
seemed
at
first
sight
a
gigantic
arsenal
longer
than
it
was
broad
peopled
by
human
ants
and
full
of
busy
honest
industry
and
displaying
all
the
various
mechanical
science
of
the
age
in
full
operation
here
the
lever
at
work
there
the
winch
and
pulley
here
the
balance
there
the
capstan
everywhere
heaps
of
stones
and
piles
of
fascines
mantelets
and
rows
of
mantelets
rolling
the
hammer
tapping
all
day
horses
and
carts
in
endless
succession
rattling
up
with
materials
only
on
looking
closer
into
the
hive
of
industry
you
might
observe
that
arrows
were
constantly
flying
to
and
fro
that
the
cranes
did
not
tenderly
deposit
their
masses
of
stone
but
flung
them
with
an
indifference
to
property
though
on
scientific
principles
and
that
among
the
tubs
full
of
arrows
and
the
and
the
beams
the
fagots
and
other
utensils
here
and
there
a
workman
or
a
soldier
lay
flatter
than
is
usual
in
limited
naps
and
something
more
or
less
feathered
stuck
in
them
and
blood
and
other
essentials
oozed
out
at
the
edge
of
the
moat
opposite
the
wooden
tower
a
strong
penthouse
which
they
called
a
cat
might
be
seen
stealing
towards
the
curtain
and
gradually
filling
up
the
moat
with
fascines
and
rubbish
which
the
workmen
flung
out
at
its
mouth
it
was
advanced
by
two
sets
of
ropes
passing
round
pulleys
and
each
worked
by
a
windlass
at
some
distance
from
the
cat
the
knight
burnt
the
first
cat
by
flinging
blazing
on
it
so
the
besiegers
made
the
roof
of
this
one
very
steep
and
covered
it
with
raw
hides
and
the
could
not
harm
it
then
the
knight
made
signs
with
his
spear
and
a
little
trebuchet
behind
the
walls
began
dropping
stones
just
clear
of
the
wall
into
the
moat
and
at
last
they
got
the
range
and
a
stone
went
clean
through
the
roof
of
the
cat
and
made
an
ugly
hole
baldwyn
of
burgundy
saw
this
and
losing
his
temper
ordered
the
great
catapult
that
was
battering
the
of
the
curtain
opposite
it
to
be
turned
and
levelled
slantwise
at
this
invulnerable
knight
denys
and
his
englishman
went
to
dinner
these
two
worthies
being
eternally
on
the
watch
for
one
another
had
made
a
sort
of
distant
acquaintance
and
conversed
by
signs
especially
on
a
topic
that
in
peace
or
war
maintains
the
same
importance
sometimes
denys
would
put
a
piece
of
bread
on
the
top
of
his
mantelet
and
then
the
archer
would
hang
something
of
the
kind
out
by
a
string
or
the
order
of
invitation
would
be
reversed
anyway
they
always
managed
to
dine
together
and
now
the
engineers
proceeded
to
the
unusual
step
of
slinging
stones
at
an
individual
this
catapult
was
a
scientific
simple
and
beautiful
engine
and
very
effective
in
vertical
fire
at
the
short
ranges
of
the
period
imagine
a
cut
down
and
set
to
turn
round
a
horizontal
axis
on
lofty
uprights
but
not
in
equilibrio
of
the
tree
being
on
the
hither
side
at
the
shorter
and
thicker
end
of
the
tree
was
fastened
a
weight
of
half
a
ton
this
butt
end
just
before
the
discharge
pointed
towards
the
enemy
by
means
of
a
powerful
winch
the
long
tapering
portion
of
the
tree
was
forced
down
to
the
very
ground
and
fastened
by
a
bolt
and
the
stone
placed
in
a
sling
attached
to
the
tree
nose
but
this
process
of
course
raised
the
butt
end
with
its
huge
weight
high
in
the
air
and
kept
it
there
struggling
in
vain
to
come
down
the
bolt
was
now
drawn
gravity
an
institution
which
flourished
even
then
resumed
its
sway
the
short
end
swung
furiously
down
the
long
end
went
as
furiously
round
up
and
at
its
highest
elevation
flung
the
huge
stone
out
of
the
sling
with
a
tremendous
jerk
in
this
case
the
huge
mass
so
flung
missed
the
knight
but
came
down
near
him
on
the
penthouse
and
went
through
it
like
paper
making
an
awful
gap
in
roof
and
floor
through
the
latter
fell
out
two
inanimate
objects
the
stone
itself
and
the
mangled
body
of
a
besieger
it
had
struck
they
fell
down
the
high
curtain
side
down
down
and
struck
almost
together
the
sullen
waters
of
the
moat
which
closed
bubbling
on
them
and
kept
both
the
stone
and
the
bone
two
hundred
years
till
cannon
mocked
those
oft
perturbed
waters
and
civilization
dried
them
aha
a
good
shot
cried
baldwyn
of
burgundy
the
tall
knight
retired
the
besiegers
hooted
him
he
reappeared
on
the
platform
of
the
barbican
his
helmet
being
just
visible
above
the
parapet
he
seemed
very
busy
and
soon
an
enormous
turkish
catapult
made
its
appearance
on
the
platform
and
aided
by
the
elevation
at
which
it
was
planted
flung
a
twentypound
stone
some
two
hundred
and
forty
yards
in
the
air
it
bounded
after
that
and
knocked
some
dirt
into
the
lord
anthony
eye
and
made
him
swear
the
next
stone
struck
a
horse
that
was
bringing
up
a
sheaf
of
arrows
in
a
cart
bowled
the
horse
over
dead
like
a
rabbit
and
spilt
the
cart
it
was
then
turned
at
the
besiegers
wooden
tower
supposed
to
be
out
of
shot
sir
turk
slung
stones
cut
with
sharp
edges
on
purpose
and
struck
it
repeatedly
and
broke
it
in
several
places
the
besiegers
turned
two
of
their
slinging
engines
on
this
monster
and
kept
constantly
slinging
smaller
stones
on
to
the
platform
of
the
barbican
and
killed
two
of
the
engineers
but
the
turk
disdained
to
retort
he
flung
a
stone
on
to
the
besiegers
great
catapult
and
hitting
it
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
axis
knocked
the
whole
structure
to
pieces
and
sent
the
engineers
skipping
and
yelling
in
the
afternoon
as
simon
was
running
back
to
his
mantelet
from
a
palisade
where
he
had
been
shooting
at
the
besieged
denys
peeping
through
his
slit
saw
the
poor
fellow
suddenly
stare
and
hold
out
his
arms
then
roll
on
his
face
and
a
feathered
arrow
protruded
from
his
back
the
archer
showed
himself
a
moment
to
enjoy
his
skill
it
was
the
englishman
denys
already
prepared
shot
his
bolt
and
the
murderous
archer
staggered
away
wounded
but
poor
simon
never
moved
his
wars
were
over
i
am
unlucky
in
my
comrades
said
denys
the
next
morning
an
unwelcome
sight
greeted
the
besieged
the
cat
was
covered
with
mattresses
and
raw
hides
and
fast
filling
up
the
moat
the
knight
stoned
it
but
in
vain
flung
burning
on
it
but
in
vain
then
with
his
own
hands
he
let
down
by
a
rope
a
bag
of
burning
sulphur
and
pitch
and
stunk
them
out
but
baldwyn
armed
like
a
lobster
ran
and
bounding
on
the
roof
cut
the
string
and
the
work
went
on
then
the
knight
sent
fresh
engineers
into
the
mine
and
undermined
the
place
and
underpinned
it
with
beams
and
covered
the
beams
thickly
with
grease
and
tar
at
break
of
day
the
moat
was
filled
and
the
wooden
tower
began
to
move
on
its
wheels
towards
a
part
of
the
curtain
on
which
two
catapults
were
already
playing
to
breach
the
hoards
and
clear
the
way
there
was
something
awful
and
magical
in
its
approach
without
visible
agency
for
it
was
driven
by
internal
rollers
worked
by
leverage
on
the
top
was
a
platform
where
stood
the
first
assailing
party
protected
in
front
by
the
drawbridge
of
the
turret
which
stood
vertical
till
lowered
on
to
the
wall
but
better
protected
by
full
suits
of
armour
the
beseiged
slung
at
the
tower
and
struck
it
often
but
in
vain
it
was
well
defended
with
mattresses
and
hides
and
presently
was
at
the
edge
of
the
moat
the
knight
bade
fire
the
mine
underneath
it
then
the
turkish
engine
flung
a
stone
of
half
a
hundredweight
right
amongst
the
knights
and
carried
two
away
with
it
off
the
tower
on
to
the
plain
one
lay
and
writhed
the
other
neither
moved
nor
spake
and
now
the
besieging
catapults
flung
blazing
and
fired
the
hoards
on
both
sides
and
the
assailants
ran
up
the
ladders
behind
the
tower
and
lowered
the
drawbridge
on
to
the
battered
curtain
while
the
catapults
in
concert
flung
and
fired
the
adjoining
works
to
dislodge
the
defenders
the
armed
men
on
the
platform
sprang
on
the
bridge
led
by
baldwyn
the
invulnerable
knight
and
his
met
them
and
a
fearful
combat
ensued
in
which
many
a
figure
was
seen
to
fall
headlong
down
off
the
narrow
bridge
but
fresh
besiegers
kept
swarming
up
behind
the
tower
and
the
besieged
were
driven
off
the
bridge
another
minute
and
the
town
was
taken
but
so
well
had
the
firing
of
the
mine
been
timed
that
just
at
this
instant
the
underpinners
gave
way
and
the
tower
suddenly
sank
away
from
the
walls
tearing
the
drawbridge
clear
and
pouring
the
soldiers
off
it
against
the
masonry
and
on
to
the
dry
moat
the
besieged
uttered
a
fierce
shout
and
in
a
moment
surrounded
baldwyn
and
his
fellows
but
strange
to
say
offered
them
quarter
while
a
party
disarmed
and
disposed
of
these
others
fired
the
turret
in
fifty
places
with
a
sort
of
hand
grenades
at
this
work
who
so
busy
as
the
tall
knight
he
put
the
on
his
long
spear
and
thrust
them
into
the
doomed
structure
late
so
terrible
to
do
this
he
was
obliged
to
stand
on
a
projecting
beam
of
the
shattered
hoard
holding
on
by
the
hand
of
a
pikeman
to
steady
himself
this
provoked
denys
he
ran
out
from
his
mantelet
hoping
to
escape
notice
in
the
confusion
and
levelling
his
crossbow
missed
the
knight
clean
but
sent
his
bolt
into
the
brain
of
the
pikeman
and
the
tall
knight
fell
heavily
from
the
wall
lance
and
all
denys
gazed
and
in
that
unlucky
moment
suddenly
he
felt
his
arm
hot
then
cold
and
there
was
an
english
arrow
skewering
it
this
episode
was
unnoticed
in
a
much
greater
matter
the
knight
his
armour
glittering
in
the
morning
sun
fell
headlong
but
turning
as
he
neared
the
water
struck
it
with
a
slap
that
sounded
a
mile
off
none
ever
thought
to
see
him
again
but
he
fell
at
the
edge
of
the
fascines
on
which
the
turret
stood
all
cocked
on
one
side
and
his
spear
stuck
into
them
under
water
and
by
a
mighty
effort
he
got
to
the
side
but
could
not
get
out
anthony
sent
a
dozen
knights
with
a
white
flag
to
take
him
prisoner
he
submitted
like
a
lamb
but
said
nothing
he
was
taken
to
anthony
tent
that
worthy
laughed
at
first
at
the
sight
of
his
muddy
armour
but
presently
frowning
said
i
marvel
sir
that
so
good
a
knight
as
you
should
know
his
devoir
so
ill
as
turn
rebel
and
give
us
all
this
i
am
what
then
a
a
what
then
thy
armour
shall
be
stripped
off
and
thou
shalt
be
tied
to
a
stake
in
front
of
the
works
and
riddled
with
arrows
for
a
warning
to
do
why
not
what
whom
your
what
have
you
knaves
him
the
warlike
hosier
nodded
hang
the
fool
said
anthony
peevishly
the
warlike
hosier
watched
his
eye
and
doffing
his
helmet
took
out
of
the
lining
an
intercepted
letter
from
the
duke
bidding
the
said
anthony
come
to
court
immediately
as
he
was
to
represent
the
court
of
burgundy
at
the
court
of
england
was
to
go
over
and
receive
the
english
sister
and
conduct
her
to
her
bridegroom
the
earl
of
charolois
the
mission
was
one
very
soothing
to
anthony
pride
and
also
to
his
love
of
pleasure
for
edward
the
fourth
held
the
gayest
and
most
luxurious
court
in
europe
the
sly
hosier
saw
he
longed
to
be
off
and
said
we
ye
a
thousand
angels
to
raise
the
and
baldwyn
i
and
send
him
with
the
it
was
now
and
a
flag
of
truce
being
hoisted
on
both
sides
the
sham
knight
and
the
true
one
dined
together
and
came
to
a
friendly
understanding
but
what
is
your
grievance
my
good
friend
much
denys
on
finding
the
arrow
in
his
right
arm
turned
his
back
which
was
protected
by
a
long
shield
and
walked
sulkily
into
camp
he
was
met
by
the
comte
de
jarnac
who
had
seen
his
brilliant
shot
and
finding
him
wounded
into
the
bargain
gave
him
a
handful
of
broad
pieces
hast
got
the
better
of
thy
grief
arbalestrier
my
grief
yes
but
not
my
love
as
soon
as
ever
i
have
put
down
this
rebellion
i
go
to
holland
and
there
i
shall
meet
with
this
event
was
nearer
than
denys
thought
he
was
relieved
from
service
next
day
and
though
his
wound
was
no
trifle
set
out
with
a
stout
heart
to
rejoin
his
friend
in
holland
chapter
xliii
a
change
came
over
margaret
brandt
she
went
about
her
household
duties
like
one
in
a
dream
if
peter
did
but
speak
a
little
quickly
to
her
she
started
and
fixed
two
terrified
eyes
on
him
she
went
less
often
to
her
friend
margaret
van
eyck
and
was
ill
at
her
ease
when
there
instead
of
meeting
her
warm
old
friend
caresses
she
used
to
receive
them
passive
and
trembling
and
sometimes
almost
shrink
from
them
but
the
most
extraordinary
thing
was
she
never
would
go
outside
her
own
house
in
daylight
when
she
went
to
tergou
it
was
after
dusk
and
she
returned
before
daybreak
she
would
not
even
go
to
matins
at
last
peter
unobservant
as
he
was
noticed
it
and
asked
her
the
reason
methinks
the
folk
all
look
at
one
day
margaret
van
eyck
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
a
scared
look
and
a
flood
of
tears
were
all
the
reply
the
old
lady
expostulated
gently
what
sweetheart
afraid
to
confide
your
sorrows
to
me
i
have
no
sorrows
madam
but
of
my
own
making
i
am
kinder
treated
than
i
deserve
especially
in
this
then
why
not
come
oftener
my
dear
i
come
oftener
than
i
deserve
and
she
sighed
deeply
there
reicht
is
bawling
for
you
said
margaret
van
eyck
go
child
what
on
earth
can
it
be
turning
possibilities
over
in
her
mind
she
thought
margaret
must
be
mortified
at
the
contempt
with
which
she
was
treated
by
gerard
family
i
will
take
them
to
task
for
it
at
least
such
of
them
as
are
women
and
the
very
next
day
she
put
on
her
hood
and
cloak
and
followed
by
reicht
went
to
the
hosier
house
catherine
received
her
with
much
respect
and
thanked
her
with
tears
for
her
kindness
to
gerard
but
when
encouraged
by
this
her
visitor
diverged
to
margaret
brandt
catherine
eyes
dried
and
her
lips
turned
to
half
the
size
and
she
looked
as
only
obstinate
ignorant
women
can
look
when
they
put
on
this
cast
of
features
you
might
as
well
attempt
to
soften
or
convince
a
brick
wall
margaret
van
eyck
tried
but
all
in
vain
so
then
not
being
herself
used
to
be
thwarted
she
got
provoked
and
at
last
went
out
hastily
with
an
abrupt
and
mutilated
curtsey
which
catherine
returned
with
an
air
rather
of
defiance
than
obeisance
outside
the
door
margaret
van
eyck
found
reicht
conversing
with
a
pale
girl
on
crutches
margaret
van
eyck
was
pushing
by
them
with
heightened
colour
and
a
scornful
toss
intended
for
the
whole
family
when
suddenly
a
little
delicate
hand
glided
timidly
into
hers
and
looking
round
she
saw
two
eyes
with
the
water
in
them
that
sought
hers
gratefully
and
at
the
same
time
imploringly
the
old
lady
read
this
wonderful
look
complex
as
it
was
and
down
went
her
choler
she
stopped
and
kissed
kate
brow
i
see
said
she
mind
then
i
leave
it
to
returned
home
she
said
i
have
been
to
a
house
where
i
have
seen
a
very
common
thing
and
a
very
uncommon
thing
i
have
seen
a
stupid
obstinate
woman
and
i
have
seen
an
angel
in
the
flesh
with
a
i
had
it
here
i
take
down
my
brushes
once
more
and
try
and
paint
little
kate
did
not
belie
the
good
opinion
so
hastily
formed
of
her
she
waited
a
better
opportunity
and
told
her
mother
what
she
had
learned
from
reicht
heynes
that
margaret
had
shed
her
very
blood
for
gerard
in
the
wood
see
mother
how
she
loves
who
would
not
love
him
oh
mother
think
of
it
poor
ay
wench
she
has
her
own
trouble
no
doubt
as
well
as
we
ours
i
ca
abide
the
sight
of
blood
let
alone
my
this
was
a
point
gained
but
when
kate
tried
to
follow
it
up
she
was
stopped
short
about
a
month
after
this
a
soldier
of
the
dalgetty
tribe
returning
from
service
in
burgundy
brought
a
letter
one
evening
to
the
hosier
house
he
was
away
on
business
but
the
rest
of
the
family
sat
at
supper
the
soldier
laid
the
letter
on
the
table
by
catherine
and
refusing
all
guerdon
for
bringing
it
went
off
to
sevenbergen
the
letter
was
unfolded
and
spread
out
and
curiously
enough
though
not
one
of
them
could
read
they
could
all
tell
it
was
gerard
handwriting
and
your
father
must
be
away
cried
catherine
are
ye
not
ashamed
of
yourselves
not
one
that
can
read
your
brother
but
although
the
words
were
to
them
what
hieroglyphics
are
to
us
there
was
something
in
the
letter
they
could
read
there
is
an
art
can
speak
without
words
unfettered
by
the
penman
limits
it
can
steal
through
the
eye
into
the
heart
and
brain
alike
of
the
learned
and
unlearned
and
it
can
cross
a
frontier
or
a
sea
yet
lose
nothing
it
is
at
the
mercy
of
no
translator
for
it
writes
an
universal
language
when
therefore
they
saw
this
a
picture
of
two
hands
clasped
together
which
gerard
had
drawn
with
his
pencil
between
the
two
short
paragraphs
of
which
his
letter
consisted
they
read
it
and
it
went
straight
to
their
hearts
gerard
was
bidding
them
farewell
as
they
gazed
on
that
simple
sketch
in
every
turn
and
line
of
which
they
recognized
his
manner
gerard
seemed
present
and
bidding
them
farewell
the
women
wept
over
it
till
they
could
see
it
no
longer
giles
said
poor
gerard
in
a
lower
voice
than
seemed
to
belong
to
him
even
cornelis
and
sybrandt
felt
a
momentary
remorse
and
sat
silent
and
gloomy
but
how
to
get
the
words
read
to
them
they
were
loth
to
show
their
ignorance
and
their
emotion
to
a
stranger
the
dame
van
eyck
said
kate
timidly
and
so
i
will
kate
she
has
a
good
heart
she
loves
gerard
too
she
will
be
glad
to
hear
of
him
i
was
short
with
her
when
she
came
here
but
i
will
make
my
submission
and
then
she
will
tell
me
what
my
poor
child
says
to
she
was
soon
at
margaret
van
eyck
house
reicht
took
her
into
a
room
and
said
bide
a
minute
she
is
at
her
there
was
a
young
woman
in
the
room
seated
pensively
by
the
stove
but
she
rose
and
courteously
made
way
for
the
visitor
thank
you
young
lady
the
winter
nights
are
cold
and
your
stove
is
a
catherine
then
while
warming
her
hands
inspected
her
companion
furtively
from
head
to
foot
inclusive
the
young
person
wore
an
ordinary
wimple
but
her
gown
was
trimmed
with
fur
which
was
in
those
days
almost
a
sign
of
superior
rank
or
wealth
but
what
most
struck
catherine
was
the
candour
and
modesty
of
the
face
she
felt
sure
of
sympathy
from
so
good
a
countenance
and
began
to
gossip
now
what
think
you
brings
me
here
young
lady
it
is
a
letter
a
letter
from
my
poor
boy
that
is
far
away
in
some
savage
part
or
other
and
i
take
shame
to
say
that
none
of
us
can
read
it
i
wonder
whether
you
can
read
can
ye
now
it
is
much
to
your
credit
my
dear
i
dare
say
she
be
long
but
every
minute
is
an
hour
to
a
poor
longing
i
will
read
it
to
bless
you
my
dear
bless
you
in
her
unfeigned
eagerness
she
never
noticed
the
suppressed
eagerness
with
which
the
hand
was
slowly
put
out
to
take
the
letter
she
did
not
see
the
tremor
with
which
the
fingers
closed
on
it
come
then
read
it
to
me
prithee
i
am
wearying
for
the
first
words
are
my
honoured
parents
ay
and
he
always
did
honour
us
poor
and
the
saints
have
you
in
his
holy
keeping
and
bless
you
by
night
and
by
day
your
one
harsh
deed
is
forgotten
your
years
of
love

laid
her
hand
on
her
bosom
and
sank
back
in
her
chair
with

long
sob

and

the
poor
girl

for
unnatural
composure
suddenly
gave
way
and

insensible

what
made
her
go
off

she

coming

none
are

they
seated
her
in

the

was
creeping
back

catherine
drew

staying

you
are

you
can
make
her
there

put
her
mouth
to
margaret

ear
for
half
a

went
up
to
the

and
taking
her
round
the
neck
kissed
her
warmly

you
shed
your
blood

him

his

been
to
blame
the
very
words
you
have
read
to
me

have
held
aloof
from
her
but
make
it
up
to
her

you
are
my

another
warm
embrace
sealed
this
hasty
compact
and
the
woman
of
impulse
was
gone
margaret
lay
back
in
her
chair
and
a
feeble
smile
stole
over
her
face
gerard
mother
had
kissed
her
and
called
her
daughter
but
the
next
moment
she
saw
her
old
friend
looking
at
her
with
a
vexed
air
i
wonder
you
let
that
woman
kiss
his
mother

reproachfully
mother
or
no
mother
you
would
not
let
her
touch
you

you
knew

she
whispered
in

ear
about
about
me

ay
about
you
whom
she
never
saw
till
the
old
lady
was
proceeding
with
some
hesitation
and
choice
of
language
to
make
margaret
share
her
indignation
when
an
interruption
closed
her
lips
the
young
woman
slid
from
her
chair
to
her
knees
and
began
to
pray
piteously
to
her
for
pardon
from
the
words
and
the
manner
of
her
penitence
a
bystander
would
have
gathered
she
had
inflicted
some
cruel
wrong
some
intolerable
insult
upon
her
venerable
friend
chapter

the
little
party
at
the
hosier
house
sat
at
table
discussing
the
recent
event
when
their
mother
returned
and
casting
a
piercing
glance
all
round
the
little
circle
laid
the
letter
flat
on
the
table
she
repeated
every
word
of
it
by
memory
following
the
lines
with
her
finger
to
cheat
herself
and
bearers
into
the
notion
that
she
could
read
the
words
or
nearly
then
suddenly
lifting
her
head
she
cast
another
keen
look
on
cornelis
and
sybrandt
their
eyes
fell
on
this
the
storm
that
had
long
been
brewing
burst
on
their
heads
catherine
seemed
to
swell
like
an
angry
hen
ruffling
her
feathers
and
out
of
her
mouth
came
a
rhone
and
saone
of
wisdom
and
twaddle
of
great
and
mean
invective
such
as
no
male
that
ever
was
born
could
utter
in
one
current
and
not
many
women
the
following
is
a
fair
though
a
small
sample
of
her
words
only
they
were
uttered
all
in
one
breath
i
have
long
had
my
doubts
that
you
blew
the
flame
betwixt
gerard
and
your
father
and
set
that
old
rogue
ghysbrecht
on
and
now
here
are
gerard
own
written
words
to
prove
it
you
have
driven
your
own
flesh
and
blood
into
a
far
land
and
robbed
the
mother
that
bore
you
of
her
darling
the
pride
of
her
eye
the
joy
of
her
heart
but
you
are
all
of
a
piece
from
end
to
end
when
you
were
all
boys
together
my
others
were
a
comfort
but
you
were
a
curse
mischievous
and
sly
and
took
a
woman
half
a
day
to
keep
your
clothes
whole
for
why
work
wears
cloth
but
play
cuts
it
with
the
beard
comes
prudence
but
none
came
to
you
still
the
last
to
go
to
bed
and
the
last
to
leave
it
and
why
because
honesty
goes
to
bed
early
and
industry
rises
betimes
where
there
are
two
in
a
house
there
are
a
pair
of
often
sat
and
looked
at
your
ways
and
wondered
where
ye
came
from
ye
take
after
your
father
and
ye
are
no
more
like
me
than
a
wasp
is
to
an
ant
sure
ye
were
changed
in
the
cradle
or
the
cuckoo
dropped
ye
on
my
floor
for
ye
have
not
our
hands
nor
our
hearts
of
all
my
blood
none
but
you
ever
jeered
them
that
god
afflicted
but
often
when
my
back
was
turned
i
heard
you
mock
at
giles
because
he
is
not
as
big
as
some
and
at
my
lily
kate
because
she
is
not
so
strong
as
a
flanders
mare
after
that
rob
a
church
an
you
will
for
you
can
be
no
worse
in
his
eyes
that
made
both
kate
and
giles
and
in
mine
that
suffered
for
them
poor
darlings
as
i
did
for
you
you
paltry
unfeeling
treasonable
curs
no
i
will
not
hush
my
daughter
they
have
filled
the
cup
too
full
it
takes
a
deal
to
turn
a
mother
heart
against
the
sons
she
has
nursed
upon
her
knees
and
many
is
the
time
i
have
winked
and
would
see
too
much
and
bitten
my
tongue
lest
their
father
should
know
them
as
i
do
he
would
have
put
them
to
the
door
that
moment
but
now
they
have
filled
the
cup
too
full
and
where
got
ye
all
this
money
for
this
last
month
you
have
been
rolling
in
it
you
never
wrought
for
it
i
wish
i
may
never
hear
from
other
mouths
how
ye
got
it
it
is

that
night
you
were
out
so
late

your
head
came
back

if

any

shall
hold
him
in

crafty

not

catherine
was
a
good
housewife
who
seldom
left
home
for
a
day
and
then
one
thing
or
another
always
went
amiss
she
was
keenly
conscious
of
this
and
watching
for
a
slack
tide
in
things
domestic
put
off
her
visit
to
sevenbergen
from
day
to
day
and
one
afternoon
that
it
really
could
have
been
managed
peter
buyskens
mule
was
out
of
the
way
at
last
one
day
eli
asked
her
before
all
the
family
whether
it
was
true
she
had
thought
of
visiting
margaret
brandt
ay
my
then
i
do
forbid
oh
do
you
i
then
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
i
suppose
said
she
colouring
not
a
word
replied
eli
sternly
when
she
was
alone
with
her
daughter
she
was
very
severe
not
upon
eli
but
upon
herself
behoved
me
rather
go
thither
like
a
cat
at
a
robin
but
this
was
me
all
over
i
am
like
a
silly
hen
that
can
lay
no
egg
without
cackling
and
convening
all
the
house
to
rob
her
o
next
time
you
and
i
are
after
aught
the
least
amiss
let
in
heaven
name
then
and
there
and
not
take
time
to
think
about
it
far
less
talk
so
then
if
they
take
us
to
task
we
can
say
alack
we
knew
nought
we
thought
no
ill
now
ever
and
so
forth
for
two
pins
i
go
thither
in
all
their
defiance
so
wild
and
picturesque
staggered
kate
nay
mother
with
patience
father
will
come
and
so
will
michaelmas
but
when
and
i
was
so
bent
on
you
seeing
the
girl
then
we
could
have
put
our
heads
together
about
her
say
what
they
will
there
is
no
judging
body
or
beast
but
by
the
eye
and
were
i
to
have
fifty
more
sons
i
thwart
one
of
them
fancy
till
such
time
as
i
had
clapped
my
eyes
upon
her
and
seen
quicksands
say
you
i
should
have
thought
of
that
before
condemning
gerard
his
fancy
but
there
life
is
a
school
and
the
lesson
done
we
put
down
one
fault
and
take
up
and
so
go
blundering
here
and
blundering
there
till
we
blunder
into
our
graves
and
there
an
end

noble
word
for
ye
said
catherine
proudly
our
gerard
taught
thee
that
i
go
bail
come
then
out
with
thy
well
then
sooth
to
say
i
have
seen
and
and
spoken
with
her
to
and
never
told
me
after
this
marvels
are
mother
you
were
so
hot
against
her
i
waited
till
i
could
tell
you
without
angering
you
ay
said
catherine
half
sadly
half
bitterly
like
mother
like
daughter
cowardice
it
is
our
bane
the
others
i
whiles
buffet
or
how
would
the
house
fare
but
did
you
kate
ever
have
harsh
word
or
look
from
your
poor
mother
that
you
nay
i
will
not
have
ye
cry
girl
ten
to
one
ye
had
your
reason
so
rise
up
brave
heart
and
tell
me
all
better
late
than
and
first
and
foremost
when
ever
and
how
ever
wend
you
to
sevenbergen
wi
your
poor
crutches
and
i
not
know
i
never
was
there
in
my
life
and
mammy
dear
to
say
that
i
wished
to
see
her
that
i
will
not
but
i
went
nor
sought
to
see
there
now
said
catherine
disputatively
said
i
not
was
all
unlike
my
girl
to
seek
her
unbeknown
to
me
come
now
for
i
all
agog
then
thus
was
it
came
to
my
ears
no
matter
how
and
prithee
good
mother
on
my
knees
ask
me
how
that
gerard
was
a
prisoner
in
the
stadthouse
ah
by
father
behest
as
was
catherine
uttered
a
sigh
that
was
almost
a
moan
blacker
than
i
thought
she
muttered
faintly
giles
and
i
went
out
at
night
to
bid
him
be
of
good
cheer
and
there
at
the
tower
foot
was
a
brave
lass
quite
strange
to
me
i
vow
on
the
same
lookee
there
now
at
first
we
did
properly
frighten
one
another
through
the
place
his
bad
name
and
our
poor
heads
being
so
full
o
divels
and
we
whitened
a
bit
in
moonshine
but
next
moment
quo
i
are
margaret
you
are
kate
quo
she
think
o
did
one
ever
was
gerard
he
will
have
been
talking
backards
and
forrards
of
thee
to
her
and
her
to
in
return
for
this
kate
bestowed
on
catherine
one
of
the
prettiest
presents
in
nature
the
composite
kiss
she
imprinted
on
her
cheek
a
single
kiss
which
said
quite
correct
good
clever
mother
for
guessing
so
right
and
quick
how
sweet
for
us
twain
to
be
of
one
mind
again
after
never
having
been
otherwise
etc
now
then
speak
thy
mind
child
gerard
is
not
here
alas
what
am
i
saying
would
to
heaven
he
well
then
mother
she
is
comely
and
wrongs
her
picture
but
eh
dear
hark
to
young
folk
i
am
for
good
acts
not
good
looks
loves
she
my
boy
as
he
did
ought
to
be
loved
sevenbergen
is
farther
from
the
stadthouse
than
we
are
said
kate
thoughtfully
yet
she
was
there
afore
catherine
nodded
intelligence
nay
more
she
had
got
him
out
ere
i
came
ay
down
from
the
catherine
shook
her
head
incredulously
the
highest
tower
for
miles
it
is
not
is
sooth
though
she
and
an
old
man
she
brought
found
means
and
wit
to
send
him
up
a
rope
there
was
dangling
from
his
prison
and
our
giles
went
up
it
when
first
i
saw
it
hang
i
said
is
glamour
but
when
the
frank
lass
arms
came
round
me
and
her
bosom
did
beat
on
mine
and
her
cheeks
wet
then
said
i
not
glamour
is
love
for
she
is
not
like
me
but
lusty
and
able
and
dear
heart
even
i
poor
frail
creature
do
feel
sometimes
as
i
could
move
the
world
for
them
i
love
i
love
you
mother
and
she
loves
god
bless
her
god
bless
her
but
but
what
lamb
her
love
is
it
for
very
certain
honest
is
most
strange
but
that
very
thing
which
hath
warmed
your
heart
hath
somewhat
cooled
mine
towards
her
poor
soul
she
is
no
wife
you
know
mother
when
all
is
humph
they
have
stood
at
the
altar
ay
but
they
went
as
they
came
maid
and
the
parson
saith
he
so
nay
for
that
i
know
then
i
take
no
man
word
but
his
in
such
a
tangled
after
some
reflection
she
added
natheless
art
right
girl
i
to
sevenbergen
alone
a
wife
i
am
but
not
a
slave
we
are
all
in
the
dark
here
and
she
holds
the
clue
i
must
question
her
and
no
one
by
least
of
all
you
i
not
take
any
lily
to
a
house
wi
a
spot
no
not
to
a
palace
o
gold
and
the
more
catherine
pondered
this
conversation
the
more
she
felt
drawn
towards
margaret
and
moreover
she
was
all
agog
with
curiosity
a
potent
passion
with
us
all
and
nearly
omnipotent
with
those
who
like
catherine
do
not
slake
it
with
reading
at
last
one
fine
day
after
dinner
she
whispered
to
kate
keep
the
house
from
going
to
pieces
an
ye
can
and
donned
her
best
kirtle
and
hood
and
her
scarlet
clocked
hose
and
her
new
shoes
and
trudged
briskly
off
to
sevenbergen
troubling
no
man
mule
when
she
got
there
she
inquired
where
margaret
brandt
lived
the
first
person
she
asked
shook
his
head
and
said
the
name
is
strange
to
she
went
a
little
farther
and
asked
a
girl
of
about
fifteen
who
was
standing
at
a
door
father
said
the
girl
speaking
into
the
house
here
is
another
after
that
magician
the
man
came
out
and
told
catherine
peter
brandt
cottage
was
just
outside
the
town
on
the
east
side
you
may
see
the
chimney
hence
and
he
pointed
it
out
to
her
but
you
will
not
find
them
there
neither
father
nor
daughter
they
have
left
the
town
this
week
bless
say
not
so
good
man
and
me
walken
all
the
way
from
from
tergou
then
you
must
ha
met
the
what
soldier
ay
i
did
meet
a
well
then
yon
soldier
was
here
seeking
that
ay
and
war
a
mad
with
us
because
she
was
gone
put
in
the
girl
his
long
beard
and
her
cheek
are
no
strangers
i
say
no
more
than
ye
know
said
catherine
sharply
you
are
young
to
take
to
slandering
your
elders
stay
tell
we
more
about
this
soldier
good
man
nay
i
know
no
more
than
that
he
came
hither
seeking
margaret
brandt
and
i
told
him
she
and
her
father
had
made
a
moonlight
flit
o
this
day
sennight
and
that
some
thought
the
devil
had
flown
away
with
them
being
magicians
says
he
devil
fly
away
with
thee
for
thy
ill
news
that
was
my
thanks
i
doubt
is
a
lie
said
he
you
think
so
said
i
and
see
will
said
he
and
burst
out
wi
a
hantle
o
gibberish
my
wife
thinks
was
curses
and
hied
him
to
the
cottage
presently
back
a
comes
and
sings
tune
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
says
he
and
shoves
a
silver
coin
in
my
hand
show
it
the
wife
some
of
ye
then
she
believe
me
i
have
been
called
a
liar
once
it
needs
not
said
catherine
inspecting
the
coin
all
the
same
and
he
seemed
quiet
and
sad
like
did
he
now
wench
that
a
did
said
the
young
woman
warmly
and
dame
he
was
just
as
pretty
a
man
as
ever
i
clapped
eyes
on
cheeks
like
a
rose
and
shining
beard
and
eyes
in
his
head
like
i
saw
he
was
well
bearded
said
catherine
but
for
the
rest
at
my
age
i
scan
them
not
as
when
i
was
young
and
foolish
but
he
seemed
right
civil
doffed
his
bonnet
to
me
as
i
had
been
a
queen
and
i
did
drop
him
my
best
reverence
for
manners
beget
manners
but
little
i
wist
he
had
been
her
light
o
love
and
most
likely
the
who
bakes
for
this
town
the
man
not
being
acquainted
with
her
opened
his
eyes
at
this
transition
swift
and
smooth
well
dame
there
be
two
john
bush
and
eric
donaldson
they
both
bide
in
this
then
god
be
with
you
good
people
said
she
and
proceeded
but
her
sprightly
foot
came
flat
on
the
ground
now
and
no
longer
struck
it
with
little
jerks
and
cocking
heel
she
asked
the
bakers
whether
peter
brandt
had
gone
away
in
their
debt
bush
said
they
were
not
customers
donaldson
said
not
a
stiver
his
daughter
had
come
round
and
paid
him
the
very
night
they
went
did
believe
they
owed
a
copper
in
the
so
catherine
got
all
the
information
of
that
kind
she
wanted
with
very
little
trouble
can
you
tell
me
what
sort
this
margaret
was
said
she
as
she
turned
to
go
well
somewhat
too
reserved
for
my
taste
i
like
a
chatty
customer
when
i
not
too
busy
but
she
bore
a
high
character
for
being
a
good
is
no
small
praise
a
lass
i
am
told
why
whence
come
you
wyfe
from
oh
ay
well
you
shall
judge
the
lads
clept
her
beauty
of
sevenbergen
the
lasses
did
scout
it
merrily
and
terribly
pulled
her
to
pieces
and
found
so
many
faults
no
two
could
agree
where
the
fault
that
is
enough
said
catherine
i
see
the
bakers
are
no
fools
in
sevenbergen
and
the
young
women
no
shallower
than
in
other
she
bought
a
manchet
of
bread
partly
out
of
sympathy
and
justice
she
kept
a
shop
partly
to
show
her
household
how
much
better
bread
she
gave
them
daily
and
returned
to
tergou
dejected
kate
met
her
outside
the
town
with
beaming
eyes
well
kate
lass
it
is
a
happy
thing
i
went
i
am
heartbroken
gerard
has
been
sore
abused
the
child
is
none
of
ourn
nor
the
mother
from
this
alas
mother
i
fathom
not
your
ask
me
no
more
girl
but
never
mention
her
name
to
me
again
that
is
kate
acquiesced
with
a
humble
sigh
and
they
went
home
together
they
found
a
soldier
seated
tranquilly
by
their
fire
the
moment
they
entered
the
door
he
rose
and
saluted
them
civilly
they
stood
and
looked
at
him
kate
with
some
little
surprise
but
catherine
with
a
great
deal
and
with
rising
indignation
what
makes
you
here
was
catherine
greeting
i
came
to
seek
after
well
we
know
no
such
say
not
so
dame
sure
you
know
her
by
name
margaret
we
have
heard
of
her
for
that
matter
to
our
comes
dame
prithee
tell
me
at
least
where
she
i
know
not
where
she
bides
and
care
denys
felt
sure
this
was
a
deliberate
untruth
he
bit
his
lip
well
i
looked
to
find
myself
in
an
enemy
country
at
this
tergou
but
maybe
if
ye
knew
all
ye
would
not
be
so
i
do
know
all
replied
catherine
bitterly
this
morn
i
knew
then
suddenly
setting
her
arms
akimbo
she
told
him
with
a
raised
voice
and
flashing
eyes
she
wondered
at
his
cheek
sitting
down
by
that
hearth
of
all
hearths
in
the
world
may
satan
fly
away
with
your
hearth
to
the
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
shouted
denys
who
could
speak
flemish
fluently
your
own
servant
bade
me
sit
there
till
you
came
else
i
had
troubled
your
hearth
my
malison
on
it
and
on
the
churlish
that
greets
an
unoffending
stranger
this
way
and
he
strode
scowling
to
the
door
oh
oh
ejaculated
catherine
frightened
and
also
a
little
and
the
virago
sat
suddenly
down
and
burst
into
tears
her
daughter
followed
suit
quietly
but
without
loss
of
time
a
shrewd
writer
now
unhappily
lost
to
us
has
somewhere
the
following
dialogue
she
i
feel
all
a
woman
he
then
you
are
denys
by
anticipation
confirmed
that
valuable
statement
he
stood
at
the
door
looking
ruefully
at
the
havoc
his
thunderbolt
of
eloquence
had
made
nay
wife
said
he
weep
not
neither
for
a
soldier
hasty
word
i
mean
not
all
i
said
why
your
house
is
your
own
and
what
right
in
it
have
i
there
now
i
what
is
to
do
said
a
grave
manly
voice
it
was
eli
he
had
come
in
from
the
shop
here
is
a
ruffian
been
of
your
women
folk
and
making
them
cry
explained
denys
little
kate
what
for
ruffians
do
not
use
to
call
themselves
ruffians
said
eli
the
sensible
ere
she
could
explain
hold
your
tongue
girl
said
catherine
muriel
bade
him
sat
down
and
i
knew
not
that
and
wyted
on
him
and
he
was
going
and
leaving
his
malison
on
us
root
and
branch
i
was
never
so
becursed
in
all
my
days
oh
oh
oh
you
were
both
somewhat
to
blame
both
you
and
he
said
eli
calmly
however
what
the
servant
says
the
master
should
still
stand
to
we
keep
not
open
house
but
yet
we
are
not
poor
enough
to
grudge
a
seat
at
our
hearth
in
a
cold
day
to
a
wayfarer
with
an
honest
face
and
as
i
think
a
wounded
man
so
end
all
malice
and
sit
ye
down
wounded
cried
mother
and
daughter
in
a
breath
think
you
a
soldier
slings
his
arm
for
sport
nay
is
but
an
arrow
said
denys
cheerfully
but
an
arrow
said
kate
with
concentrated
horror
where
were
our
eyes
mother
nay
in
good
sooth
a
trifle
which
however
i
will
pray
mesdames
to
accept
as
an
excuse
for
my
vivacity
is
these
little
foolish
trifling
wounds
that
fret
a
man
worthy
sir
why
look
ye
now
sweeter
temper
than
our
gerard
never
breathed
yet
when
the
bear
did
but
strike
a
piece
no
bigger
than
a
crown
out
of
his
calf
he
turned
so
hot
and
choleric
said
he
was
no
son
of
yours
but
got
by
the
good
knight
sir
john
pepper
on
his
wife
dame
mustard
who

a
dwarf

servant

roared
the
newcomer
denys
started
he
had
not
counted
on
exchanging
greetings
with
a
petard
denys
words
had
surprised
his
hosts
but
hardly
more
than
their
deportment
now
did
him
they
all
three
came
creeping
up
to
where
he
sat
and
looked
down
into
him
with
their
lips
parted
as
if
he
had
been
some
strange
phenomenon
and
growing
agitation
succeeded
to
amazement
now
hush
said
eli
let
none
speak
but
i
young
man
said
he
solemnly
in
god
name
who
are
you
that
know
us
though
we
know
you
not
and
that
shake
our
hearts
speaking
to

of

poor
rebellious
son
whom

and
bless

his
voice

eli
impatiently
and
let
the
young
man
answer
me
how
came

to
know
gerard
our
son
prithee
now

on
a
parent

and
answer
me
straightforward
like

soldier

shall
i
was
paid
off
at
flushing
and
started
for
burgundy
on
the
german
frontier
i
lay
at
the
same
inn
with
gerard
i
fancied
him

said
my
comrade
he
was
loth
at
first
consented

a
weary
league
we
trode
together

were
truer
comrades
never
will
be
while
earth

i
left

route
a
bit
to

he
his
to

talked
of
sevenbergen
and
tergou
a
thousand
times
and
of
all
in
this
house

had
our
troubles
on
the
road
but
battling
them
together
made
them
light
i
saved
his
life
from
a
bear
he
mine
in
the
rhine
for
he
swims
like
a
duck
and
i
like
a
hod
o
bricks
and
one
another
lives
at
an
inn
in
burgundy
where
we
two
held
a
room
for
a
good
hour
against
seven
and
crippled
one
and
slew
two
and
your
son
did
his
devoir
like
a
man
and
met
the
stoutest
champion
i
ever
countered
and
spitted
him
like
a
else
i
had
not
been
here
but
just
when
all
was
fair
and
i
was
to
see
him
safe
aboard
ship
for
rome
if
not
to
rome
itself
met
us
that
son
of
a
the
lord
anthony
of
burgundy
and
his
men
making
for
flanders
then
in
insurrection
tore
us
by
force
apart
took
me
where
i
got
some
broad
pieces
in
hand
and
a
broad
arrow
in
my
shoulder
and
left
my
poor
gerard
lonesome
at
that
sad
parting
soldier
though
i
be
these
eyes
did
rain
salt
scalding
tears
and
so
did
his
poor
soul
his
last
word
to
me
was
comfort
margaret
so
here
i
be
mine
to
him
was
no
more
of
rome
make
for
rhine
and
down
stream
home
now
say
for
you
know
best
did
i
advise
him
well
or
ill
soldier
take
my
hand
said
eli
god
bless
thee
god
bless
thee
and
his
lip
quivered
it
was
all
his
reply
but
more
eloquent
than
many
words
catherine
did
not
answer
at
all
but
she
darted
from
the
room
and
bade
muriel
bring
the
best
that
was
in
the
house
and
returned
with
wood
in
both
arms
and
heaped
the
fire
and
took
out
a
cloth
from
the
press
and
was
going
in
a
great
hurry
to
lay
it
for
gerard
friend
when
suddenly
she
sat
down
and
all
the
power
ebbed
rapidly
out
of
her
body
father
cried
kate
whose
eye
was
as
quick
as
her
affection
denys
started
up
but
eli
waved
him
back
and
flung
a
little
water
sharply
in
his
wife
face
this
did
her
instant
good
she
gasped
so
sudden
my
poor
boy
eli
whispered
denys
take
no
notice
she
thinks
of
him
night
and
they
pretended
not
to
observe
her
and
she
shook
it
off
and
hustled
and
laid
the
cloth
with
her
own
hands
but
as
she
smoothed
it
her
hands
trembled
and
a
tear
or
two
stole
down
her
cheeks
they
could
not
make
enough
of
denys
they
stuffed
him
and
crammed
him
and
then
gathered
round
him
and
kept
filling
his
glass
in
turn
while
by
that
genial
blaze
of
fire
and
ruby
wine
and
eager
eyes
he
told
all
that
i
have
related
and
a
vast
number
of
minor
details
which
an
artist
however
minute
omits
but
how
different
the
effect
on
my
readers
and
on
this
small
circle
to
them
the
interest
was
already
made
before
the
first
word
came
from
his
lips
it
was
all
about
gerard
and
he
who
sat
there
telling
it
them
was
warm
from
gerard
and
an
actor
with
him
in
all
these
scenes
the
flesh
and
blood
around
that
fire
quivered
for
their
severed
member
hearing
its
struggles
and
perils
i
shall
ask
my
readers
to
recall
to
memory
all
they
can
of
journey
with
denys
and
in
their
mind
eye
to
see
those
very
matters
told
by
his
comrade
to
an
exile
father
all
stoic
outside
all
father
within
and
to
two
poor
women
an
exile
mother
and
a
sister
who
were
all
love
and
pity
and
tender
anxiety
both
outside
and
in
now
would
you
mind
closing
this
book
for
a
minute
and
making
an
effort
to
realize
all
this
it
will
save
us
so
much
repetition
then
you
will
not
be
surprised
when
i
tell
you
that
after
a
while
giles
came
softly
and
curled
himself
up
before
the
fire
and
lay
gazing
at
the
speaker
with
a
reverence
almost
canine
and
that
when
the
rough
soldier
had
unconsciously
but
thoroughly
betrayed
his
better
qualities
and
above
all
his
rare
affection
for
gerard
kate
though
timorous
as
a
bird
stole
her
little
hand
into
the
warrior
huge
brown
palm
where
it
lay
an
instant
like
a
of
cream
spilt
on
a
platter
then
nipped
the
ball
of
his
thumb
and
served
for
a
kardiometer
in
other
words
fate
is
just
even
to
rival
storytellers
and
balances
matters
denys
had
to
pay
a
tax
to
his
audience
which
i
have
not
whenever
gerard
was
in
too
much
danger
the
female
faces
became
so
white
and
their
poor
little
throats
gurgled
so
he
was
obliged
in
common
humanity
to
spoil
his
recital
suspense
is
the
soul
of
narrative
and
thus
dealt
of
burgundy
with
his
best
suspenses
now
dame
take
not
on
till
ye
hear
the
end
let
not
your
cheek
blanch
so
courage
it
looks
ugly
but
you
shall
hear
how
we
won
through
had
he
miscarried
and
i
at
hand
would
i
be
alive
and
meantime
kate
little
kardiometer
or
graduated
emotion
and
pinched
by
scale
at
its
best
it
was
by
no
means
a
engine
but
all
is
relative
denys
soon
learned
the
tender
gamut
and
when
to
water
the
suspense
and
extract
the
thrill
as
far
as
possible
on
one
occasion
only
he
cannily
indemnified
his
narrative
for
this
drawback
falling
personally
into
the
rhine
and
sinking
he
got
pinched
he
denys
to
his
surprise
and
satisfaction
oho
thought
he
and
on
the
principle
of
the
anatomists
experimentum
in
corpore
vili
kept
himself
a
quarter
of
an
hour
under
water
under
pressure
all
the
time
and
even
when
gerard
had
got
hold
of
him
he
was
loth
to
leave
the
river
so
less
conscientious
than
i
was
swam
with
gerard
to
the
east
bank
first
and
was
about
to
land
but
detected
the
officers
and
their
intent
chaffed
them
a
little
space
treading
water
then
turned
and
swam
wearily
all
across
and
at
last
was
obliged
to
get
out
for
very
shame
or
else
acknowledge
himself
a
pike
so
permitted
himself
to
land
exhausted
and
the
pressure
relaxed
it
was
eleven
an
hour
but
they
took
no
note
of
time
this
night
and
denys
had
still
much
to
tell
them
when
the
door
was
opened
quietly
and
in
stole
cornelis
and
sybrandt
looking
they
had
this
night
been
drinking
the
very
last
drop
of
their
mysterious
funds
catherine
feared
her
husband
would
rebuke
them
before
denys
but
he
only
looked
sadly
at
them
and
motioned
them
to
sit
down
quietly
denys
it
was
who
seemed
discomposed
he
knitted
his
brows
and
eyed
them
thoughtfully
and
rather
gloomily
then
turned
to
catherine
what
say
you
dame
the
rest
for
i
am
somewhat
weary
and
it
waxes
so
be
it
said
eli
but
when
denys
rose
to
go
to
his
inn
he
was
instantly
stopped
by
catherine
and
think
you
to
lie
from
this
house
gerard
room
has
been
got
ready
for
you
hours
agone
the
sheets
not
say
much
for
seeing
i
spun
the
flax
and
wove
the
then
would
i
lie
in
them
blindfold
was
the
gallant
reply
ah
dame
our
poor
gerard
was
the
one
for
fine
linen
he
could
hardly
forgive
the
honest
germans
their
coarse
flax
and
my
traitors
of
countrymen
did
amiss
a
would
excuse
them
saying
well
bonnes
toiles
sont
en
bourgogne
that
means
there
be
good
lenten
cloths
in
burgundy
but
indeed
he
beat
all
for
bywords
and
cleanliness
oh
eli
eli
doth
not
our
son
come
back
to
us
at
each
word
ay
buss
me
my
poor
kate
you
and
i
know
all
that
passeth
in
each
other
hearts
this
night
none
other
can
but
chapter
xlvii
denys
took
an
opportunity
next
day
and
told
mother
and
daughter
the
rest
excusing
himself
characteristically
for
not
letting
cornelis
and
sybrandt
hear
of
it
it
is
not
for
me
to
blacken
them
they
come
of
a
good
stock
but
gerard
looks
on
them
as
no
friends
of
his
in
this
matter
and
i
gerard
comrade
and
it
is
a
rule
with
us
soldiers
not
to
tell
the
enemy
aught
but
catherine
sighed
but
made
no
answer
the
adventures
he
related
cost
them
a
tumult
of
agitation
and
grief
and
sore
they
wept
at
the
parting
of
the
friends
which
even
now
denys
could
not
tell
without
faltering
but
at
last
all
merged
in
the
joyful
hope
and
expectation
of
gerard
speedy
return
in
this
denys
confidently
shared
but
reminded
them
that
was
no
reason
why
he
should
neglect
his
friend
wishes
and
last
words
in
fact
should
gerard
return
next
week
and
no
margaret
to
be
found
what
sort
of
figure
should
he
cut
catherine
had
never
felt
so
kindly
towards
the
truant
margaret
as
now
and
she
was
fully
as
anxious
to
find
her
and
be
kind
to
her
before
gerard
return
as
denys
was
but
she
could
not
agree
with
him
that
anything
was
to
be
gained
by
leaving
this
neighbourhood
to
search
for
her
she
must
have
told
somebody
whither
she
was
going
it
is
not
as
though
they
were
dishonest
folk
flying
the
country
they
owe
not
a
stiver
in
sevenbergen
and
dear
heart
denys
you
ca
hunt
all
holland
for
can
i
not
said
denys
grimly
that
we
shall
he
added
after
some
reflection
that
they
must
divide
their
forces
she
stay
here
with
eyes
and
ears
wide
open
and
he
ransack
every
town
in
holland
for
her
if
need
be
but
she
will
not
be
many
leagues
from
here
they
be
three
three
fly
not
so
fast
nor
far
as
that
is
sense
said
catherine
but
she
insisted
on
his
going
first
to
the
demoiselle
van
eyck
she
and
our
margaret
were
bosom
friends
she
knows
where
the
girl
is
gone
if
she
will
but
tell
denys
was
for
going
to
her
that
instant
so
catherine
in
a
turn
of
the
hand
made
herself
one
shade
neater
and
took
him
with
her
she
was
received
graciously
by
the
old
lady
sitting
in
a
richly
furnished
room
and
opened
her
business
the
tapestry
dropped
out
of
margaret
van
eyck
hands
gone
gone
from
sevenbergen
and
not
told
me
the
thankless
this
turn
greatly
surprised
the
visitors
what
you
know
not
when
was
she
here
last
maybe
ten
days
agone
i
had
out
my
brushes
after
so
many
years
to
paint
her
portrait
i
did
not
do
it
though
for
catherine
remarked
it
was
a
most
strange
thing
she
should
go
away
bag
and
baggage
like
this
without
with
your
leave
or
by
your
leave
why
or
wherefore
was
ever
aught
so
untoward
just
when
all
our
hearts
are
warm
to
her
and
here
is
gerard
mate
come
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
with
comfort
for
her
from
gerard
and
ca
find
her
and
gerard
himself
expected
what
to
do
i
know
not
but
sure
she
is
not
parted
like
this
without
a
reason
can
ye
not
give
us
the
clue
my
good
demoiselle
prithee
now
i
have
it
not
to
give
said
the
elder
lady
rather
peevishly
then
i
can
said
reicht
heynes
showing
herself
in
the
doorway
with
colour
somewhat
heightened
so
you
have
been
hearkening
all
the
time
eh
what
are
my
ears
for
mistress
true
well
throw
us
the
light
of
thy
wisdom
on
this
dark
there
is
no
darkness
that
i
see
said
reicht
and
the
clue
why
an
ye
a
twine
and
the
ends
o
in
this
room
now
ye
not
be
far
out
oh
mistress
i
wonder
at
you
sitting
there
marry
come
and
the
mistress
cheek
was
now
nearly
as
red
as
the
servant
so
was
i
drove
the
foolish
girl
you
did
your
share
mistress
what
sort
of
greeting
gave
you
her
last
time
she
came
think
you
she
could
miss
to
notice
it
and
she
all
friendless
and
you
said
have
altered
my
mind
about
painting
of
you
says
you
a
turning
up
your
nose
at
i
did
not
turn
up
my
nose
it
is
not
shaped
like
yours
for
looking
oh
all
our
nosen
can
follow
our
heartys
bent
for
that
matter
poor
soul
she
did
come
into
the
kitchen
to
me
am
not
to
be
painted
now
said
she
and
the
tears
in
her
eyes
she
said
no
more
but
i
knew
well
what
she
did
mean
i
had
seen
well
said
margaret
van
eyck
i
do
confess
so
much
and
i
make
you
the
judge
madam
know
that
these
young
girls
can
do
nothing
of
their
own
heads
but
are
most
apt
at
mimicking
aught
their
sweethearts
do
now
your
gerard
is
reasonably
handy
at
many
things
and
among
the
rest
at
the
illuminator
craft
and
margaret
she
is
his
pupil
and
a
patient
one
what
marvel
having
a
woman
eye
for
colour
and
eke
a
lover
to
ape
is
a
trick
i
despise
at
heart
for
by
it
the
great
art
of
colour
which
should
be
royal
aspiring
and
free
becomes
a
poor
slave
to
the
petty
crafts
of
writing
and
printing
and
is
fettered
imprisoned
and
made
little
body
and
soul
to
match
the
littleness
of
books
and
go
to
church
in
a
rich
fool
pocket
natheless
affection
rules
us
all
and
when
the
poor
wench
would
bring
me
her
thorn
leaves
and
lilies
and
ivy
and
dewberries
and
ladybirds
and
butterfly
grubs
and
all
the
scum
of
fast
in
like
wasps
in
a
and
withal
her
diurnal
book
showing
she
had
pored
an
hundred
or
an
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
hours
over
each
singular
page
certes
i
was
wroth
that
an
immortal
soul
and
many
hours
of
labour
and
much
manual
skill
should
be
flung
away
on
nature
trash
leaves
insects
grubs
and
on
barren
letters
but
having
bowels
i
did
perforce
restrain
and
as
it
were
dam
my
better
feelings
and
looked
kindly
at
the
work
to
see
how
it
might
be
bettered
and
said
i
heaven
for
our
sins
hath
doomed
us
to
spend
time
and
soul
and
colour
on
great
letters
and
little
beetles
omitting
such
small
fry
as
saints
and
heroes
their
acts
and
passions
why
not
present
the
scum
naturally
i
told
her
grapes
i
saw
walking
abroad
did
hang
i
the
air
not
stick
in
a
wall
and
even
these
insects
quo
i
nature
her
slime
in
general
pass
not
their
noxious
lives
wedged
miserably
in
metal
prisons
like
flies
in
and
but
do
crawl
or
hover
at
large
infesting
air
my
dear
friend
says
she
see
now
whither
you
drive
but
this
ground
is
gold
whereon
we
may
not
shade
said
so
quoth
i
teachers
of
this
craft
says
she
and
to
make
an
end
o
me
at
once
i
trow
himself
for
gerard
himself
quoth
i
all
the
gang
me
a
brush
then
chose
i
to
shade
her
fruit
and
reptiles
a
colour
false
in
nature
but
true
relatively
to
that
monstrous
ground
of
glaring
gold
and
in
five
minutes
out
came
a
bunch
of
raspberries
stalk
and
all
and
flew
in
your
mouth
likewise
a
butterfly
grub
she
had
so
truly
presented
as
might
turn
the
stoutest
stomach
my
lady
she
flings
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
says
she
did
she
now
the
little
love
observed
denys
succeeding
at
last
in
wedging
in
a
word
margaret
van
eyck
stared
at
him
and
then
smiled
she
went
on
to
tell
them
how
from
step
to
step
she
had
been
led
on
to
promise
to
resume
the
art
she
had
laid
aside
with
a
sigh
when
her
brothers
died
and
to
paint
the
madonna
once
more
with
margaret
for
model
incidentally
she
even
revealed
how
girls
are
turned
into
saints
thy
hair
is
adorable
said
i
why
is
red
quo
she
ay
quoth
i
but
what
a
red
how
brown
how
glossy
most
hair
is
not
worth
a
straw
to
us
painters
thine
the
artist
very
hue
but
thy
violet
eyes
which
smack
of
earth
being
now
languid
for
lack
of
one
gerard
now
full
of
fire
in
hopes
of
the
same
gerard
these
will
i
lift
to
heaven
in
fixed
and
holy
meditation
and
thy
nose
which
doth
already
somewhat
aspire
that
way
though
not
so
piously
as
reicht
will
i
debase
a
trifle
and
somewhat
enfeeble
thy
enfeeble
her
chin
alack
what
may
that
mean
ye
go
beyond
me
is
a
resolute
chin
not
a
jot
too
resolute
for
this
wicked
world
but
when
ye
come
to
a
madonna
no
thank
well
i
never
a
resolute
denys
the
darling
and
now
comes
the
rub
when
you
told
me
she
was
the
way
she
is
it
gave
me
a
shock
i
dropped
my
brushes
was
i
going
to
turn
a
girl
that
could
keep
her
lover
at
a
distance
into
the
virgin
mary
at
my
time
of
life
i
love
the
poor
ninny
still
but
i
adore
our
blessed
lady
say
you
painter
must
not
be
peevish
in
such
matters
well
most
painters
are
men
and
men
are
fine
fellows
they
can
do
aught
their
saints
and
virgins
are
neither
more
nor
less
than
their
lemans
saving
your
presence
but
know
that
for
this
very
reason
half
their
craft
is
lost
on
me
which
find
beneath
their
angels
white
wings
the
very
trollops
i
have
seen
flaunting
it
on
the
streets
bejewelled
like
paynim
idols
and
put
on
like
the
queens
in
a
pack
o
cards
and
i
am
not
a
fine
fellow
but
only
a
woman
and
my
painting
is
but
one
half
craft
and
half
devotion
so
now
you
may
read
me
was
foolish
maybe
but
i
could
not
help
it
yet
am
i
and
the
old
lady
ended
despondently
a
discourse
which
she
had
commenced
in
defiant
tone
well
you
know
dame
observed
catherine
you
must
think
it
would
go
to
the
poor
girl
heart
and
she
so
fond
of
ye
margaret
van
eyck
only
sighed
the
frisian
girl
after
biting
her
lips
impatiently
a
little
while
turned
upon
catherine
why
dame
think
you
was
for
that
alone
margaret
and
peter
hath
left
sevenbergen
for
what
else
then
what
else
why
because
gerard
people
slight
her
so
cruel
who
would
bide
among
folk
that
ha
driven
her
lad
t
italy
and
now
he
is
gone
relent
not
but
face
it
out
and
come
anigh
her
that
is
left
reicht
i
was
oh
ay
going
and
going
and
going
ye
should
ha
said
less
or
else
done
more
but
with
your
words
you
did
uplift
her
heart
and
let
it
down
wi
your
deeds
have
never
been
said
the
poor
thing
to
me
with
such
a
sigh
ay
here
is
one
can
feel
for
her
for
i
too
am
far
from
my
friends
and
often
when
first
i
came
to
holland
i
did
used
to
take
a
hearty
cry
all
to
myself
but
ten
times
liever
would
i
be
reicht
heynes
with
nought
but
the
leagues
me
and
all
my
kith
than
be
as
she
is
i
the
midst
of
them
that
ought
to
warm
to
her
and
yet
to
fare
as
lonesome
as
alack
reicht
i
did
go
but
yestreen
and
had
gone
before
but
one
plaguy
thing
or
did
still
come
and
hinder
mistress
did
aught
hinder
ye
to
eat
your
dinner
any
one
of
those
days
i
trow
not
and
had
your
heart
been
as
good
towards
your
own
flesh
and
blood
as
was
towards
your
flesher
meat
nought
had
prevailed
to
keep
you
from
her
that
sat
lonely
a
watching
the
road
for
you
and
comfort
wi
your
child
child
a
beating
her
here
this
rude
young
woman
was
interrupted
by
an
incident
not
uncommon
in
a
domestic
bright
existence
the
van
eyck
had
been
nettled
by
the
attack
on
her
but
with
due
tact
had
gone
into
ambush
she
now
sprang
out
of
it
since
you
disrespect
my
guests
seek
another
place
with
all
my
heart
said
reicht
stoutly
nay
mistress
put
in
the
catherine
true
folk
will
still
speak
out
her
tongue
is
a
here
the
water
came
into
the
speaker
eyes
by
way
of
confirmation
but
better
she
said
it
than
thought
it
so
now
wo
rankle
in
her
and
part
with
her
for
me
that
shall
ye
not
beshrew
the
wench
she
wots
she
is
a
good
servant
and
takes
advantage
we
poor
wretches
which
keep
house
must
still
pay
tax
for
value
i
had
a
good
servant
once
when
i
was
a
young
woman
eh
dear
how
she
did
grind
me
down
into
the
dust
in
the
end
by
heaven
mercy
she
married
the
baker
and
i
was
my
own
woman
again
said
i
more
good
servants
shall
come
hither
a
hectoring
me
i
just
get
a
fool
and
learn
her
and
whenever
she
knoweth
her
right
hand
from
her
left
she
sauceth
me
then
out
i
bundle
her
neck
and
crop
and
take
another
dunce
in
her
place
dear
heart
is
wearisome
teaching
a
string
of
fools
by
ones
but
there
i
am
mistress
here
she
forgot
that
she
was
defending
reicht
and
turning
rather
spitefully
upon
her
added
and
you
be
mistress
here
i
no
more
than
that
stool
said
the
van
eyck
loftily
she
is
neither
mistress
nor
servant
but
gone
she
is
dismissed
the
house
and
an
end
of
her
what
did
ye
not
hear
me
turn
the
saucy
baggage
off
ay
ay
we
all
heard
ye
said
reicht
with
vast
indifference
then
hear
me
said
denys
solemnly
they
all
went
round
like
things
on
wheels
and
fastened
their
eyes
on
him
ay
let
us
hear
what
the
man
says
urged
the
hostess
men
are
fine
fellows
with
their
great
hoarse
mistress
reicht
said
denys
with
great
dignity
and
ceremony
indeed
so
great
as
to
verge
on
the
absurd
you
are
turned
off
if
on
a
slight
acquaintance
i
might
advise
i
say
since
you
are
a
servant
no
more
be
a
mistress
a
easier
said
than
done
replied
reicht
bluntly
not
a
jot
you
see
here
one
who
is
a
man
though
but
half
an
arbalestrier
owing
to
that
devilish
englishman
arrow
in
whose
carcass
i
have
however
left
a
like
token
which
is
a
comfort
i
have
twenty
gold
pieces
he
showed
them
and
a
stout
arm
in
another
week
or
so
i
shall
have
twain
marriage
is
not
a
habit
of
mine
but
i
capitulate
to
so
many
virtues
you
are
beautiful
and
outspoken
and
above
all
you
take
the
part
of
my
be
then
an
arbalestriesse
and
what
the
dickens
is
that
inquired
reicht
i
mean
be
the
wife
mistress
and
queen
of
denys
of
burgundy
here
a
dead
silence
fell
on
all
it
did
not
last
long
though
and
was
followed
by
a
burst
of
unreasonable
indignation
catherine
well
did
you
ever
margaret
never
in
all
my
born
catherine
before
our
very
margaret
of
all
the
absurdity
and
insolence
of
this
ridiculous
sex
then
denys
observed
somewhat
drily
that
the
female
to
whom
he
had
addressed
himself
was
mute
and
the
others
on
whose
eloquence
there
was
no
immediate
demand
were
fluent
on
this
the
voices
stopped
and
the
eyes
turned
upon
reicht
she
took
a
sly
glance
from
under
her
lashes
at
her
military
assailant
and
said
i
mean
to
take
a
good
look
at
any
man
ere
i
leap
into
his
denys
drew
himself
up
majestically
then
look
your
fill
and
leap
this
proposal
led
to
a
new
and
most
unexpected
result
a
long
white
finger
was
extended
by
the
van
eyck
in
a
line
with
the
speaker
eye
and
an
agitated
voice
bade
him
stand
in
the
name
of
all
the
saints
you
are
beautiful
so
cried
she
you
are
inspired
with
folly
what
matters
that
you
are
inspired
i
must
take
off
your
and
in
a
moment
she
was
at
work
with
her
pencil
come
out
hussy
she
screamed
to
reicht
more
in
front
of
him
and
keep
the
fool
inspired
and
beautiful
oh
why
had
i
not
this
maniac
for
my
good
centurion
they
went
and
brought
me
a
brute
with
a
low
forehead
and
a
shapeless
catherine
stood
and
looked
with
utter
amazement
at
this
pantomime
and
secretly
resolved
that
her
venerable
hostess
had
been
a
disguised
lunatic
all
this
time
and
was
now
busy
throwing
off
the
mask
as
for
reicht
she
was
unhappy
and
cross
she
had
left
her
caldron
in
a
precarious
state
and
made
no
scruple
to
say
so
and
that
duties
so
grave
as
hers
left
her
no
time
to
waste
a
playing
the
statee
and
the
fool
all
at
one
her
mistress
in
reply
reminded
her
that
it
was
possible
to
be
rude
and
rebellious
to
one
poor
old
affectionate
desolate
mistress
without
being
utterly
heartless
and
savage
and
a
trampler
on
arts
on
this
reicht
stopped
and
pouted
and
looked
like
a
little
basilisk
at
the
inspired
model
who
caused
her
woe
he
retorted
with
unshaken
admiration
the
situation
was
at
last
dissolved
by
the
artist
wrist
becoming
cramped
from
disuse
this
was
not
however
until
she
had
made
a
rough
but
noble
sketch
i
can
work
no
more
at
present
said
she
sorrowfully
then
now
mistress
i
may
go
and
mind
my
pot
ay
ay
go
to
your
pot
and
get
into
it
do
you
will
find
your
soul
in
it
so
then
you
will
all
be
well
but
reicht
said
catherine
laughing
she
turned
you
boo
boo
boo
said
reicht
contemptuously
when
she
wants
to
get
rid
of
me
let
her
turn
herself
off
and
die
i
am
sure
she
is
old
enough
but
take
your
time
mistress
if
you
are
in
no
hurry
no
more
am
i
when
that
day
doth
come
take
a
man
to
dry
my
eyes
and
if
you
should
be
in
the
same
mind
then
soldier
you
can
say
so
and
if
you
are
not
why
be
all
one
to
reicht
and
the
plain
speaker
went
her
way
but
her
words
did
not
fall
to
the
ground
neither
of
her
female
hearers
could
disguise
from
herself
that
this
blunt
girl
solitary
herself
had
probably
read
margaret
brandt
aright
and
that
she
had
gone
away
from
sevenbergen
catherine
and
denys
bade
the
van
eyck
adieu
and
that
same
afternoon
denys
set
out
on
a
wild
goose
chase
his
plan
like
all
great
things
was
simple
he
should
go
to
a
hundred
towns
and
villages
and
ask
in
each
after
an
old
physician
with
a
fair
daughter
and
an
old
soldier
he
should
inquire
of
the
burgomasters
about
all
and
should
go
to
the
fountains
and
watch
the
women
and
girls
as
they
came
with
their
pitchers
for
water
and
away
he
went
and
was
months
and
months
on
the
tramp
and
could
not
find
her
happily
this
chivalrous
feat
of
friendship
was
in
some
degree
its
own
reward
those
who
sit
at
home
blindfolded
by
and
think
camel
or
man
out
of
the
depths
of
their
inner
consciousness
alias
their
ignorance
will
tell
you
that
in
the
intervals
of
war
and
danger
peace
and
tranquil
life
acquire
their
true
value
and
satisfy
the
heroic
mind
but
those
who
look
before
they
babble
or
scribble
will
see
and
say
that
men
who
risk
their
lives
habitually
thirst
for
exciting
pleasures
between
the
acts
of
danger
are
not
for
innocent
tranquility
to
this
denys
was
no
exception
his
whole
military
life
had
been
half
sparta
half
capua
and
he
was
too
good
a
soldier
and
too
good
a
libertine
to
have
ever
mixed
either
habit
with
the
other
but
now
for
the
first
time
he
found
himself
mixed
at
peace
and
yet
on
duty
for
he
took
this
latter
view
of
his
wild
goose
chase
luckily
so
all
these
months
he
was
a
sober
prudent
vigilant
indomitable
and
happy
though
constantly
disappointed
as
might
have
been
expected
he
flirted
gigantically
on
the
road
but
wasted
no
time
about
it
nor
in
these
his
wanderings
did
he
tell
a
single
female
that
marriage
was
not
one
of
his
habits
and
so
we
leave
him
on
the
tramp
pilgrim
of
friendship
as
his
poor
comrade
was
of
love
chapter
xlviii
catherine
was
in
dismay
when
she
reflected
that
gerard
must
reach
home
in
another
month
at
farthest
more
likely
in
a
week
and
how
should
she
tell
him
she
had
not
even
kept
an
eye
upon
his
betrothed
then
there
was
the
uncertainty
as
to
the
girl
fate
and
this
uncertainty
sometimes
took
a
sickening
form
oh
kate
she
groaned
if
she
should
have
gone
and
made
herself
away
mother
she
would
never
be
so
ah
my
lass
you
know
not
what
hasty
fools
young
lasses
be
that
have
no
mothers
to
keep
straight
they
will
fling
themselves
into
the
water
for
a
man
that
the
next
man
they
meet
would
ha
cured
of
in
a
week
i
have
known
to
jump
in
like
brass
one
moment
and
scream
for
help
in
the
next
could
know
their
own
minds
ye
see
even
about
such
a
trifle
as
yon
and
then
there
times
when
their
bodies
ail
like
no
other
living
creatures
ever
i
could
hear
of
and
that
strings
up
their
feelings
so
the
patience
that
belongs
to
them
at
other
times
beyond
all
living
souls
barring
an
ass
seems
all
to
jump
out
of
at
one
turn
and
into
the
water
they
go
therefore
i
say
that
men
are
mother
monsters
and
no
less
to
go
making
such
heaps
o
canals
just
to
tempt
the
poor
women
in
they
know
we
shall
not
cut
our
throats
hating
the
sight
of
blood
and
rating
our
skins
a
hantle
higher
nor
our
lives
and
as
for
hanging
while
she
is
a
fixing
of
the
nail
and
a
making
of
the
noose
she
has
time
t
alter
her
mind
but
a
jump
into
a
canal
is
no
more
than
into
bed
and
the
water
it
does
all
the
lave
will
ye
nill
ye
why
look
at
me
the
mother
o
nine
was
i
agog
to
make
a
hole
in
our
canal
for
the
nonce
nay
mother
i
never
believe
it
of
ye
may
though
was
in
the
first
year
of
our
keeping
house
together
eli
had
found
out
my
weak
stitches
then
nor
i
his
so
we
made
a
rent
pulling
contrariwise
had
a
quarrel
so
then
i
ran
crying
to
tell
some
gabbling
fool
like
myself
what
i
had
no
business
to
tell
out
doors
except
to
the
saints
and
there
was
one
of
our
precious
canals
in
the
way
do
they
take
us
for
teal
oh
how
tempting
it
did
look
says
i
to
myself
he
has
let
me
go
out
of
his
door
quarrelled
he
shall
see
me
drowned
next
and
then
he
will
change
his
key
he
will
blubber
a
good
one
and
i
shall
look
down
from
heaven
i
forgot
i
should
be
in
part
see
him
take
on
and
oh
but
that
will
be
sweet
and
i
was
all
a
tiptoe
and
going
in
only
just
then
i
thought
i
would
i
had
got
a
new
gown
a
making
for
one
thing
and
hard
upon
finished
so
i
went
home
instead
and
what
was
eli
first
word
yon
flea
stick
i
the
wall
my
lass
says
he
a
word
of
all
i
said
t
anger
thee
was
sooth
but
this
i
love
these
were
his
very
words
i
minded
being
the
first
quarrel
so
i
flung
my
arms
about
his
neck
and
sobbed
a
bit
and
thought
o
the
canal
and
he
was
no
colder
to
me
than
i
to
him
being
a
man
and
a
young
one
and
so
then
that
was
better
than
lying
in
the
water
and
spoiling
my
wedding
kirtle
and
my
fine
new
shoon
old
john
bush
made
that
was
uncle
to
him
keeps
the
shop
now
and
what
was
my
grief
to
hers
little
kate
hoped
that
margaret
loved
her
father
too
much
to
think
of
leaving
him
so
at
his
age
he
is
father
and
mother
and
all
to
her
you
nay
kate
they
do
forget
all
these
things
in
a
moment
o
despair
when
the
very
sky
seems
black
above
them
i
place
more
faith
in
him
that
is
unborn
than
on
him
that
is
ripe
for
the
grave
to
keep
her
out
mischief
for
certes
it
do
go
sore
against
us
to
die
when
there
a
little
innocent
a
pulling
at
our
hearts
to
let
live
and
feeding
at
our
very
well
then
keep
up
a
good
heart
she
added
that
very
likely
all
these
fears
were
exaggerated
she
ended
by
solemnly
entreating
her
mother
at
all
events
not
to
persist
in
naming
the
sex
of
infant
it
was
so
unlucky
all
the
gossips
told
her
dear
heart
as
if
there
were
not
as
many
girls
born
as
this
reflection
though
not
unreasonable
was
met
with
clamour
have
you
the
cruelty
to
threaten
me
with
a
girl
i
want
no
more
girls
while
i
have
you
what
use
would
a
lass
be
to
me
can
i
set
her
on
my
knee
and
see
my
gerard
again
as
i
can
a
boy
i
tell
thee
is
all
settled
how
may
that
be
in
my
mind
and
if
i
am
to
be
disappointed
i
the
end
is
for
you
to
disappoint
me
beforehand
telling
me
it
is
not
to
be
a
child
but
only
a
chapter
xlix
margaret
brandt
had
always
held
herself
apart
from
sevenbergen
and
her
reserve
had
passed
for
pride
this
had
come
to
her
ears
and
she
knew
many
hearts
were
swelling
with
jealousy
and
malevolence
how
would
they
triumph
over
her
when
her
condition
could
no
longer
be
concealed
this
thought
gnawed
her
night
and
day
for
some
time
it
had
made
her
bury
herself
in
the
house
and
shun
daylight
even
on
those
rare
occasions
when
she
went
abroad
not
that
in
her
secret
heart
and
conscience
she
mistook
her
moral
situation
as
my
unlearned
readers
have
done
perhaps
though
not
acquainted
with
the
nice
distinctions
of
the
contemporary
law
she
knew
that
betrothal
was
a
marriage
contract
and
could
no
more
be
legally
broken
on
either
side
than
any
other
compact
written
and
witnessed
and
that
marriage
with
another
party
than
the
betrothed
had
been
formerly
annulled
both
by
church
and
state
and
that
betrothed
couples
often
came
together
without
any
further
ceremony
and
their
children
were
legitimate
but
what
weighed
down
her
simple
mediaeval
mind
was
this
that
very
contract
of
betrothal
was
not
forthcoming
instead
of
her
keeping
it
gerard
had
got
it
and
gerard
was
far
far
away
she
hated
and
despised
herself
for
the
miserable
oversight
which
had
placed
her
at
the
mercy
of
false
opinion
for
though
she
had
never
heard
horace
famous
couplet
segnius
irritant
she
was
horatian
by
the
plain
hard
positive
intelligence
which
strange
to
say
characterizes
the
judgment
of
her
sex
when
feeling
happens
not
to
blind
it
altogether
she
gauged
the
understanding
of
the
world
to
a
her
marriage
lines
being
out
of
sight
and
in
italy
would
never
prevail
to
balance
her
visible
pregnancy
and
the
sight
of
her
child
when
born
what
sort
of
a
tale
was
this
to
stop
slanderous
tongues
i
have
got
my
marriage
lines
but
i
can
not
show
them
what
woman
would
believe
her
or
even
pretend
to
believe
her
and
as
she
was
in
reality
one
of
the
most
modest
girls
in
holland
it
was
women
good
opinion
she
wanted
not
men
even
barefaced
slander
attacks
her
sex
at
a
great
advantage
but
here
was
slander
with
a
face
of
truth
the
woman
had
not
yet
been
invented
and
margaret
though
by
nature
and
by
having
been
early
made
mistress
of
a
family
she
was
resolute
in
some
respects
was
weak
as
water
in
others
and
weakest
of
all
in
this
like
all
the
elite
of
her
sex
she
was
a
poor
little
leaf
trembling
at
each
gust
of
the
world
opinion
true
or
false
much
misery
may
be
contained
in
few
words
i
doubt
if
pages
of
description
from
any
man
pen
could
make
any
human
creature
except
virtuous
women
and
these
need
no
such
aid
realize
the
anguish
of
a
virtuous
woman
foreseeing
herself
paraded
as
a
frail
one
had
she
been
frail
at
heart
she
might
have
brazened
it
out
but
she
had
not
that
advantage
she
was
really
pure
as
snow
and
saw
the
pitch
coming
nearer
her
and
nearer
the
poor
girl
sat
listless
hours
at
a
time
and
moaned
with
inner
anguish
and
often
when
her
father
was
talking
to
her
and
she
giving
mechanical
replies
suddenly
her
cheek
would
burn
like
fire
and
the
old
man
would
wonder
what
he
had
said
to
discompose
her
nothing
his
words
were
less
than
air
to
her
it
was
the
dread
sent
the
colour
of
shame
into
her
burning
cheek
no
matter
what
she
seemed
to
be
talking
and
thinking
about
but
both
shame
and
fear
rose
to
a
climax
when
she
came
back
that
night
from
margaret
van
eyck
her
condition
was
discovered
and
by
persons
of
her
own
sex
the
old
artist
secluded
like
herself
might
not
betray
her
but
catherine
a
gossip
in
the
centre
of
a
family
and
a
thick
neighbourhood
one
spark
of
hope
remained
catherine
had
spoken
kindly
even
lovingly
the
situation
admitted
no
half
course
gerard
mother
thus
roused
must
either
be
her
best
friend
or
worst
enemy
she
waited
then
in
racking
anxiety
to
hear
more
no
word
came
she
gave
up
hope
catherine
was
not
going
to
be
her
friend
then
she
would
expose
her
since
she
had
no
strong
and
kindly
feeling
to
balance
the
natural
love
of
babbling
then
it
was
the
wish
to
fly
from
this
neighbourhood
began
to
grow
and
gnaw
upon
her
till
it
became
a
wild
and
passionate
desire
but
how
persuade
her
father
to
this
old
people
cling
to
places
he
was
very
old
and
infirm
to
change
his
abode
there
was
no
course
but
to
make
him
her
confidant
better
so
than
to
run
away
from
him
and
she
felt
that
would
be
the
alternative
and
now
between
her
uncontrollable
desire
to
fly
and
hide
and
her
invincible
aversion
to
speak
out
to
a
man
even
to
her
father
she
vibrated
in
a
suspense
full
of
lively
torture
and
presently
betwixt
these
two
came
in
one
day
the
fatal
thought
end
all
things
foolishly
worded
are
not
always
foolish
one
of
poor
bugbears
these
numerous
canals
did
sorely
tempt
this
poor
fluctuating
girl
she
stood
on
the
bank
one
afternoon
and
eyed
the
calm
deep
water
it
seemed
an
image
of
repose
and
she
was
so
harassed
no
more
trouble
no
more
fear
of
shame
if
gerard
had
not
loved
her
i
doubt
she
had
ended
there
as
it
was
she
kneeled
by
the
water
side
and
prayed
fervently
to
god
to
keep
such
wicked
thoughts
from
her
oh
selfish
wretch
said
she
to
leave
thy
father
oh
wicked
wretch
to
kill
thy
child
and
make
thy
poor
gerard
lose
all
his
pain
and
peril
undertaken
for
thy
sight
i
will
tell
father
all
ay
ere
this
sun
shall
and
she
went
home
with
eager
haste
lest
her
good
resolution
should
ooze
out
ere
she
got
there
now
in
matters
domestic
the
learned
peter
was
simple
as
a
child
and
margaret
from
the
age
of
sixteen
had
governed
the
house
gently
but
absolutely
it
was
therefore
a
strange
thing
in
this
house
the
faltering
irresolute
way
in
which
its
young
but
despotic
mistress
addressed
that
person
who
in
a
domestic
sense
was
less
important
than
martin
wittenhaagen
or
even
than
the
little
girl
who
came
in
the
morning
and
for
a
pittance
washed
the
vessels
and
went
home
at
night
father
i
would
speak
to
speak
on
wilt
listen
to
me
and
and
not
and
try
to
excuse
my
faults
we
have
all
our
faults
margaret
thou
no
more
than
the
rest
of
us
but
fewer
unless
parental
feeling
blinds
alas
no
father
i
am
a
poor
foolish
girl
that
would
fain
do
well
but
have
done
ill
most
ill
most
unwisely
and
now
must
bear
the
shame
but
father
i
love
you
with
all
my
faults
and
will
not
you
forgive
my
folly
and
still
love
your
motherless
girl
that
ye
may
count
on
said
peter
cheerfully
oh
well
smile
not
for
then
how
can
i
speak
and
make
you
sad
why
what
is
the
matter
father
disgrace
is
coming
on
this
house
it
is
at
the
door
and
i
the
culprit
oh
father
turn
your
head
away
i
i
father
i
have
let
gerard
take
away
my
marriage
is
that
all
was
an
was
the
deed
of
a
mad
woman
but
woe
is
me
that
is
not
the
peter
interrupted
her
the
youth
is
honest
and
loves
you
dear
you
are
young
what
is
a
year
or
two
to
you
gerard
will
assuredly
come
back
and
keep
and
meantime
know
you
what
is
coming
not
i
except
that
i
shall
be
gone
first
for
worse
than
that
there
is
worse
pain
than
death
nay
for
pity
sake
turn
away
your
head
foolish
wench
muttered
peter
but
turned
his
head
she
trembled
violently
and
with
her
cheeks
on
fire
began
to
falter
out
i
did
look
on
gerard
as
my
husband
we
being
he
was
in
so
sore
danger
and
i
thought
i
had
killed
him
and
if
you
were
but
my
mother
i
might
find
courage
you
would
question
me
but
you
say
not
a
why
margaret
what
is
all
this
coil
about
and
why
are
thy
cheeks
crimson
speaking
to
no
stranger
but
to
thy
old
father
why
are
my
cheeks
on
fire
because
because
father
kill
me
send
me
to
heaven
bid
martin
shoot
me
with
his
arrow
and
then
the
gossips
will
come
and
tell
you
why
i
blush
so
this
day
and
then
when
i
am
dead
i
hope
you
will
love
your
girl
again
for
her
mother
give
me
thy
hand
mistress
said
peter
a
little
sternly
she
put
it
out
to
him
trembling
he
took
it
gently
and
began
with
some
anxiety
in
his
face
to
feel
her
pulse
alas
nay
said
she
is
my
soul
that
burns
not
my
body
with
fever
i
can
not
will
not
bide
in
and
she
wrung
her
hands
impatiently
be
calm
now
said
the
old
man
soothingly
nor
torment
thyself
for
nought
not
bide
in
sevenbergen
what
need
to
bide
a
day
as
it
vexes
thee
and
puts
thee
in
a
fever
for
fevered
thou
art
deny
it
what
cried
margaret
would
you
yield
to
go
hence
and
and
ask
no
reason
but
my
longing
to
be
gone
and
suddenly
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
beside
him
in
a
fervour
of
supplication
she
clutched
his
sleeve
and
then
his
arm
and
then
his
shoulder
while
imploring
him
to
quit
this
place
and
not
ask
her
why
alas
what
needs
it
you
will
soon
see
it
and
i
could
never
say
it
i
would
liever
foolish
child
who
seeks
thy
girlish
secrets
is
it
i
whose
life
hath
been
spent
in
searching
nature
and
for
leaving
sevenbergen
what
is
there
to
keep
me
in
it
thee
unwilling
is
there
respect
for
me
here
or
gratitude
am
i
not
yclept
quacksalver
by
those
that
come
not
near
me
and
wizard
by
those
i
heal
and
give
they
not
the
guerdon
and
the
honour
they
deny
me
to
the
empirics
that
slaughter
them
besides
what
to
me
where
we
sojourn
choose
thou
that
as
did
thy
mother
before
margaret
embraced
him
tenderly
and
wept
upon
his
shoulder
she
was
respited
yet
as
she
wept
respited
she
almost
wished
she
had
had
the
courage
to
tell
him
after
a
while
nothing
would
content
him
but
her
taking
a
medicament
he
went
and
brought
her
she
took
it
submissively
to
please
him
it
was
the
least
she
could
do
it
was
a
composing
draught
and
though
administered
under
an
error
and
a
common
one
did
her
more
good
than
harm
she
awoke
calmed
by
a
long
sleep
and
that
very
day
began
her
preparations
next
week
they
went
to
rotterdam
bag
and
baggage
and
lodged
above
a
tailor
shop
in
the
straet
only
one
person
in
tergou
knew
whither
they
were
gone
the
burgomaster
he
locked
the
information
in
his
own
breast
the
use
he
made
of
it
ere
long
my
reader
will
not
easily
divine
for
he
did
not
divine
it
himself
but
time
will
show
chapter
l
among
strangers
margaret
brandt
was
comparatively
happy
and
soon
a
new
and
unexpected
cause
of
content
arose
a
civic
dignitary
being
ill
and
fanciful
in
proportion
went
from
doctor
to
doctor
and
having
arrived
at
death
door
sent
for
peter
peter
found
him
bled
and
purged
to
nothing
he
flung
a
battalion
of
bottles
out
of
window
and
left
it
open
beat
up
yolks
of
eggs
in
neat
schiedam
and
administered
it
in
small
doses
followed
this
up
by
meat
stewed
in
red
wine
and
water
shredding
into
both
mild
febrifugal
herbs
that
did
no
harm
finally
his
patient
got
about
again
looking
something
between
a
man
and
a
and
being
a
voluble
dignitary
spread
peter
fame
in
every
street
and
that
artist
who
had
long
merited
a
reputation
in
vain
made
one
rapidly
by
luck
things
looked
bright
the
old
man
pride
was
cheered
at
last
and
his
purse
began
to
fill
he
spent
much
of
his
gain
however
in
sovereign
herbs
and
choice
drugs
and
would
have
so
invested
them
all
but
margaret
a
part
the
victory
came
too
late
its
happy
excitement
was
fatal
one
evening
in
bidding
her
his
voice
seemed
rather
inarticulate
the
next
morning
he
was
found
speechless
and
only
just
sensible
margaret
who
had
been
for
years
her
father
attentive
pupil
saw
at
once
that
he
had
had
a
paralytic
stroke
but
not
trusting
to
herself
she
ran
for
a
doctor
one
of
those
who
obstructed
by
peter
had
not
killed
the
civic
dignitary
came
and
cheerfully
confirmed
her
views
he
was
for
bleeding
the
patient
she
declined
he
was
always
against
blooding
said
she
especially
the
peter
lived
but
was
never
the
same
man
again
his
memory
became
much
affected
and
of
course
he
was
not
to
be
trusted
to
prescribe
and
several
patients
had
come
and
one
or
two
that
were
bent
on
being
cured
by
the
new
doctor
and
no
other
awaited
his
convalescence
misery
stared
her
in
the
face
she
resolved
to
go
for
advice
and
comfort
to
her
cousin
william
johnson
from
whom
she
had
hitherto
kept
aloof
out
of
pride
and
poverty
she
found
him
and
his
servant
sitting
in
the
same
room
and
neither
of
them
the
better
for
liquor
mastering
all
signs
of
surprise
she
gave
her
greetings
and
presently
told
him
she
had
come
to
talk
on
a
family
matter
and
with
this
glanced
quietly
at
the
servant
by
way
of
hint
the
woman
took
it
but
not
as
expected
oh
you
can
speak
before
me
can
she
not
my
old
man
at
this
familiarity
margaret
turned
very
red
and
said
i
cry
you
mercy
mistress
i
knew
not
my
cousin
had
fallen
into
the
custom
of
this
town
well
i
must
take
a
fitter
opportunity
and
she
rose
to
go
i
wot
not
what
ye
mean
by
custom
o
the
town
said
the
woman
bouncing
up
but
this
i
know
is
the
part
of
a
faithful
servant
to
keep
her
master
from
being
preyed
on
by
his
beggarly
margaret
retorted
ye
are
too
modest
mistress
ye
are
no
servant
your
speech
betrays
you
is
not
till
the
ape
hath
mounted
the
tree
that
she
shows
her
tail
so
plain
nay
there
sits
the
servant
god
help
him
and
while
so
it
is
fear
not
thou
his
kin
will
ever
be
so
poor
in
spirit
as
come
where
the
likes
of
you
can
flout
their
and
casting
one
look
of
mute
reproach
at
her
cousin
for
being
so
little
of
a
man
as
to
sit
passive
and
silent
all
this
time
she
turned
and
went
haughtily
out
nor
would
she
shed
a
single
tear
till
she
got
home
and
thought
of
it
and
now
here
were
two
men
to
be
lodged
and
fed
by
one
pregnant
girl
and
another
mouth
coming
into
the
world
but
this
last
though
the
most
helpless
of
all
was
their
best
friend
nature
was
strong
in
margaret
brandt
that
same
nature
which
makes
the
brutes
the
birds
and
the
insects
so
cunning
at
providing
food
and
shelter
for
their
progeny
yet
to
come
stimulated
by
nature
she
sat
and
brooded
and
brooded
and
thought
and
thought
how
to
be
beforehand
with
destitution
ay
though
she
had
still
five
gold
pieces
left
she
saw
starvation
coming
with
inevitable
foot
her
sex
when
deviating
from
custom
it
thinks
with
male
intensity
thinks
just
as
much
to
the
purpose
as
we
do
she
rose
bade
martin
move
peter
to
another
room
made
her
own
very
neat
and
clean
polished
the
glass
globe
and
suspended
it
from
the
ceiling
dusted
the
crocodile
and
nailed
him
to
the
outside
wall
and
after
duly
instructing
martin
set
him
to
play
the
lounging
sentinel
about
the
street
door
and
tell
the
that
a
great
and
aged
and
learned
alchymist
abode
there
who
in
his
moments
of
recreation
would
sometimes
amuse
himself
by
curing
mortal
diseases
patients
soon
came
and
were
received
by
margaret
and
demanded
to
see
the
leech
that
might
not
be
he
was
deep
in
his
studies
searching
for
the
grand
elixir
and
not
princes
could
have
speech
of
him
they
must
tell
her
their
symptoms
and
return
in
two
and
oh
mysterious
powers
when
they
did
return
the
drug
or
draught
was
always
ready
for
them
sometimes
when
it
was
a
worshipful
patient
she
would
carefully
scan
his
face
and
feeling
both
pulse
and
skin
as
well
as
hearing
his
story
would
go
softly
with
it
to
peter
room
and
there
think
and
ask
herself
how
her
father
whose
system
she
had
long
quietly
observed
would
have
treated
the
case
then
she
would
write
an
illegible
scrawl
with
a
cabalistic
letter
and
bring
it
down
reverently
and
show
it
the
patient
and
could
he
read
that
then
it
would
be
either
i
am
no
reader
or
with
admiration
nay
mistress
nought
can
i
make
ay
but
i
can
is
sovereign
look
on
thyself
as
cured
if
she
had
the
materials
by
her
and
she
was
too
good
an
economist
not
to
favour
somewhat
those
medicines
she
had
in
her
own
stock
she
would
sometimes
let
the
patient
see
her
compound
it
often
and
anxiously
consulting
the
sacred
prescription
lest
great
science
should
suffer
in
her
hands
and
so
she
would
send
them
away
relieved
of
cash
but
with
their
pockets
full
of
medicine
and
minds
full
of
faith
and
humbugged
to
their
hearts
content
populus
vult
decipi
and
when
they
were
gone
she
would
take
down
two
little
boxes
gerard
had
made
her
and
on
one
of
these
she
had
written
and
on
the
other
and
put
the
smaller
coins
into
and
the
larger
into
along
with
such
of
her
gold
pieces
as
had
survived
the
journey
from
sevenbergen
and
the
expenses
of
housekeeping
in
a
strange
place
and
so
she
met
current
expenses
and
laid
by
for
the
rainy
day
she
saw
coming
and
mixed
drugs
with
simples
and
vice
with
virtue
on
this
last
score
her
conscience
pricked
her
sore
and
after
each
day
comedy
she
knelt
down
and
prayed
god
to
forgive
her
for
the
sake
of
her
but
lo
and
behold
cure
and
cure
was
reported
to
her
so
then
her
conscience
began
to
harden
martin
wittenhaagen
had
of
late
been
a
dead
weight
on
her
hands
like
most
men
who
had
endured
great
hardships
he
had
stiffened
rather
suddenly
but
though
less
supple
he
was
as
strong
as
ever
and
at
his
own
pace
could
have
carried
the
doctor
herself
round
rotterdam
city
he
carried
her
slops
instead
in
this
new
business
he
showed
the
qualities
of
a
soldier
unreasoning
obedience
punctuality
accuracy
despatch
and
drunkenness
he
fell
among
good
fellows
the
blackguards
plied
him
with
schiedam
he
babbled
he
bragged
doctor
margaret
had
risen
very
high
in
his
estimation
all
this
brandishing
of
a
crocodile
for
a
standard
and
setting
a
dotard
in
ambush
and
getting
rid
of
slops
and
taking
good
money
in
exchange
struck
him
not
as
science
but
something
far
superior
strategy
and
he
boasted
in
his
cups
and
before
a
mixed
company
how
me
and
my
general
we
are
a
biting
of
the
when
this
revelation
had
had
time
to
leaven
the
city
his
general
doctor
margaret
received
a
call
from
the
constables
they
took
her
trembling
and
begging
subordinate
machines
to
forgive
her
before
the
burgomaster
and
by
his
side
stood
real
physicians
a
terrible
row
in
long
robes
and
square
caps
accusing
her
of
practising
unlawfully
on
the
bodies
of
the
duke
lieges
at
first
she
was
too
frightened
to
say
a
word
novice
like
the
very
name
of
law
paralyzed
her
but
being
questioned
closely
but
not
so
harshly
as
if
she
had
been
ugly
she
told
the
truth
she
had
long
been
her
father
pupil
and
had
but
followed
his
system
and
she
had
cured
many
and
it
is
not
for
myself
in
very
deed
sirs
but
i
have
two
poor
helpless
honest
men
at
home
upon
my
hands
and
how
else
can
i
keep
them
ah
good
sirs
let
a
poor
girl
make
her
bread
honestly
ye
hinder
them
not
to
make
it
idly
and
shamefully
and
oh
sirs
ye
are
husbands
ye
are
fathers
ye
can
not
but
see
i
have
reason
to
work
and
provide
as
best
i
may
and
ere
this
woman
appeal
had
left
her
lips
she
would
have
given
the
world
to
recall
it
and
stood
with
one
hand
upon
her
heart
and
one
before
her
face
hiding
it
but
not
the
tears
that
trickled
underneath
it
all
which
went
to
the
wrong
address
perhaps
a
female
bailiff
might
have
yielded
to
such
arguments
and
bade
her
practise
medicine
and
break
law
till
such
time
as
her
child
should
be
weaned
and
no
longer
what
have
we
to
do
with
that
said
the
burgomaster
save
and
except
that
if
thou
wilt
pledge
thyself
to
break
the
law
no
more
i
will
remit
the
imprisonment
and
exact
but
the
fine
on
this
doctor
margaret
clasped
her
hands
together
and
vowed
most
penitently
never
never
never
to
cure
body
or
beast
again
and
being
dismissed
with
the
constables
to
pay
the
fine
she
turned
at
the
door
and
curtsied
poor
soul
and
thanked
the
gentlemen
for
their
forbearance
and
to
pay
the
fine
the
box
must
be
opened
on
the
instant
and
with
excess
of
caution
she
had
gone
and
nailed
it
up
that
no
slight
temptation
might
prevail
to
open
it
and
now
she
could
not
draw
the
nails
and
the
constables
grew
impatient
and
doubted
its
contents
and
said
let
us
break
it
for
but
she
would
not
let
them
ye
will
break
it
worse
than
i
and
she
took
a
hammer
and
struck
too
faintly
and
lost
all
strength
for
a
minute
and
wept
hysterically
and
at
last
she
broke
it
and
a
little
cry
bubbled
from
her
when
it
broke
and
she
paid
the
fine
and
it
took
all
her
unlawful
gains
and
two
gold
pieces
to
boot
and
when
the
men
were
gone
she
drew
the
broken
pieces
of
the
box
and
what
little
money
they
had
left
her
all
together
on
the
table
and
her
arms
went
round
them
and
her
rich
hair
escaped
and
fell
down
all
loose
and
she
bowed
her
forehead
on
the
wreck
and
sobbed
my
love
box
it
is
broken
and
my
heart
withal
and
so
remained
and
martin
wittenhaagen
came
in
and
she
could
not
lift
her
head
but
sighed
out
to
him
what
had
befallen
her
ending
my
love
his
box
is
broken
and
so
mine
heart
is
and
martin
was
not
so
sad
as
wroth
some
traitor
had
betrayed
him
what
stony
heart
had
told
and
brought
her
to
this
pass
whoever
it
was
should
feel
his
arrow
point
the
curious
attitude
in
which
he
must
deliver
the
shaft
never
occurred
to
him
idle
chat
idle
chat
moaned
margaret
without
lifting
her
brow
from
the
table
when
you
have
slain
all
the
gossips
in
this
town
can
we
eat
them
tell
me
how
to
keep
you
all
or
prithee
hold
thy
peace
and
let
the
saints
get
leave
to
whisper
martin
held
his
tongue
and
cast
uneasy
glances
at
his
defeated
general
towards
evening
she
rose
and
washed
her
face
and
did
up
her
hair
and
doggedly
bade
martin
take
down
the
crocodile
and
put
out
a
basket
instead
i
can
get
up
linen
better
than
they
seem
to
do
it
in
this
street
said
she
and
you
must
carry
it
in
the
that
will
i
for
thy
sake
said
the
soldier
good
martin
forgive
me
that
i
spake
shrewishly
to
even
while
they
were
talking
came
a
male
for
advice
margaret
told
it
the
mayor
had
interfered
and
forbidden
her
to
sell
drugs
but
said
she
i
will
gladly
iron
and
starch
your
linen
for
you
and
i
will
come
and
fetch
it
from
your
are
ye
mad
young
woman
said
the
male
i
come
for
a
leech
and
ye
proffer
me
a
washerwoman
and
it
went
out
in
dudgeon
there
is
a
stupid
creature
said
margaret
sadly
presently
came
a
female
to
tell
the
symptoms
of
her
sick
child
margaret
stopped
it
we
are
forbidden
by
the
bailiff
to
sell
drugs
but
i
will
gladly
wash
iron
and
starch
your
linen
for
will
come
and
fetch
it
from
your
oh
ay
said
the
female
well
i
have
some
smocks
and
ruffs
foul
come
for
them
and
when
you
are
there
you
can
look
at
the
boy
and
it
told
her
where
it
lived
and
when
its
husband
would
be
out
yet
it
was
rather
fond
of
its
husband
than
not
an
introduction
is
an
introduction
and
two
or
three
patients
out
of
all
those
who
came
and
were
denied
medicine
made
doctor
margaret
their
washerwoman
now
martin
you
must
help
i
no
more
cats
than
can
slay
mistress
the
stomach
is
not
awanting
but
the
headpiece
worst
oh
i
mean
not
the
starching
and
ironing
that
takes
a
woman
and
a
handy
one
but
the
bare
washing
a
man
can
surely
contrive
that
why
a
mule
has
wit
enough
in
head
to
with
his
hoofs
an
ye
could
drive
him
into
the
tub
come
off
doublet
and
i
am
your
man
said
the
brave
old
soldier
stripping
for
the
unwonted
toil
i
risk
my
arm
in
soapsuds
an
you
will
risk
your
my
what
your
glory
and
honour
as
a
gramercy
if
you
are
man
enough
to
bring
me
linen
t
iron
i
am
woman
enough
to
back
i
the
and
so
the
brave
girl
and
the
brave
soldier
worked
with
a
will
and
kept
the
wolf
from
the
door
more
they
could
not
do
margaret
had
repaired
the
box
and
as
she
leaned
over
the
glue
her
tears
mixed
with
it
and
she
cemented
her
exiled
lover
box
with
them
at
which
a
smile
is
allowable
but
an
intelligent
smile
tipped
with
pity
please
and
not
the
empty
guffaw
of
the
burlesquing
bibles
and
making
fun
of
all
things
except
fun
but
when
mended
it
stood
unreplenished
they
kept
the
weekly
rent
paid
and
the
pot
boiling
but
no
more
and
now
came
a
concatenation
recommended
from
one
to
another
margaret
washed
for
the
mayor
and
bringing
home
the
clean
linen
one
day
she
heard
in
the
kitchen
that
his
worship
only
daughter
was
stricken
with
disease
and
not
like
to
live
poor
margaret
could
not
help
and
a
female
servant
gave
her
such
of
the
symptoms
as
she
had
observed
but
they
were
too
general
however
one
gossip
would
add
one
fact
and
another
another
and
margaret
pondered
them
all
at
last
one
day
she
met
the
mayor
himself
he
recognized
her
directly
why
you
are
the
unlicensed
i
was
said
she
but
now
your
worship
the
dignitary
coloured
and
said
that
was
rather
a
come
down
nay
i
bear
no
malice
for
your
worship
might
have
been
harder
rather
would
i
do
you
a
good
turn
sir
you
have
a
sick
daughter
let
me
see
the
mayor
shook
his
head
that
can
not
be
the
law
i
do
enforce
on
others
i
may
not
break
margaret
opened
her
eyes
alack
sir
i
seek
no
guerdon
now
for
curing
folk
why
i
am
a
washerwoman
i
trow
one
may
heal
all
the
world
an
if
one
will
but
let
the
world
starve
one
in
that
is
no
more
than
just
said
the
mayor
he
added
an
ye
make
no
trade
o
there
is
no
then
let
me
see
what
avails
it
the
learnedest
leeches
in
rotterdam
have
all
seen
her
and
bettered
her
nought
her
ill
is
inscrutable
one
skilled
wight
saith
spleen
another
liver
another
blood
another
stomach
and
another
that
she
is
possessed
and
in
very
truth
she
seems
to
have
a
demon
shunneth
all
company
pineth
alone
eateth
no
more
victuals
than
might
diet
a
sparrow
speaketh
seldom
nor
hearkens
them
that
speak
and
weareth
thinner
and
paler
and
nearer
and
nearer
the
grave
sir
said
margaret
an
if
you
take
your
velvet
doublet
to
of
shops
in
rotterdam
and
speer
is
this
fine
or
sorry
velvet
and
worth
how
much
the
ell
those
six
traders
will
eye
it
and
feel
it
and
all
be
in
one
story
to
a
letter
and
why
because
they
know
their
trade
and
your
leeches
are
all
in
different
stories
why
because
they
know
not
their
trade
i
have
heard
my
father
say
each
is
enamoured
of
some
one
evil
and
seeth
it
with
his
bat
eye
in
every
patient
had
they
stayed
at
home
and
never
seen
your
daughter
they
had
answered
all
the
same
spleen
blood
stomach
lungs
liver
lunacy
or
as
they
call
it
possession
let
me
see
her
we
are
of
a
sex
and
that
is
and
when
he
still
hesitated
saints
of
heaven
cried
she
giving
way
to
the
irritability
of
a
breeding
woman
is
this
how
men
love
their
own
flesh
and
blood
her
mother
had
me
in
her
arms
ere
this
and
carried
me
to
the
sick
and
two
violet
eyes
flashed
fire
come
with
me
said
the
mayor
hastily
mistress
i
have
brought
thee
a
new
the
person
addressed
a
pale
young
girl
of
eighteen
gave
a
contemptuous
wrench
of
her
shoulder
and
turned
more
decidedly
to
the
fire
she
was
sitting
over
margaret
came
softly
and
sat
beside
her
but
is
one
that
will
not
torment
you
a
woman
exclaimed
the
young
lady
with
surprise
and
some
contempt
tell
her
your
what
for
you
will
be
no
you
will
be
none
the
well
i
have
no
stomach
for
food
and
no
heart
for
any
thing
now
cure
me
and
patience
awhile
your
food
is
it
tasteless
like
in
your
mouth
ay
how
knew
you
that
nay
i
knew
it
not
till
you
did
tell
me
i
trow
you
would
be
better
for
a
little
good
i
trow
not
what
is
their
silly
chat
to
me
here
margaret
requested
the
father
to
leave
them
alone
and
in
his
absence
put
some
practical
questions
then
she
reflected
when
you
wake
i
the
morning
you
find
yourself
quiver
as
one
may
say
nay
ay
how
knew
you
that
shall
i
dose
you
or
shall
i
but
tease
you
a
bit
with
my
silly
chat
which
you
then
i
will
tell
you
a
story
is
about
two
true
i
hate
to
hear
of
lovers
said
the
girl
nevertheless
canst
tell
me
be
less
nauseous
than
your
physic
margaret
then
told
her
a
love
story
the
maiden
was
a
girl
called
ursel
and
the
youth
one
conrad
she
an
old
physician
daughter
he
the
son
of
a
hosier
at
tergou
she
told
their
adventures
their
troubles
their
sad
condition
she
told
it
from
the
female
point
of
view
and
in
a
sweet
and
winning
and
earnest
voice
that
by
degrees
soon
laid
hold
of
this
sullen
heart
and
held
it
breathless
and
when
she
broke
it
off
her
patient
was
much
disappointed
nay
nay
i
must
hear
the
end
i
will
hear
ye
can
not
for
i
know
it
not
none
knoweth
that
but
ah
your
ursel
was
a
jewel
of
worth
said
the
girl
earnestly
would
she
were
instead
of
her
that
is
here
i
say
not
that
and
she
blushed
a
little
you
do
but
think
thought
is
free
whether
or
no
an
she
were
here
i
give
her
a
buss
poor
then
give
it
me
for
i
am
nay
nay
that
i
be
sworn
y
are
say
not
so
in
very
truth
i
am
she
and
prithee
sweet
mistress
go
not
from
your
word
but
give
me
the
buss
ye
promised
me
and
with
a
good
heart
for
oh
my
own
heart
lies
heavy
heavy
as
thine
sweet
the
young
gentlewoman
rose
and
put
her
arms
round
margaret
neck
and
kissed
her
i
am
woe
for
you
she
sighed
you
are
a
good
soul
you
have
done
me
good
a
a
gulp
came
in
her
throat
come
again
come
again
margaret
did
come
again
and
talked
with
her
and
gently
but
keenly
watched
what
topics
interested
her
and
found
there
was
but
one
then
she
said
to
the
mayor
i
know
your
daughter
trouble
and
is
what
the
blood
the
stomach
the
liver
the
foul
fiend
what
then
love
stuff
impossible
she
is
but
a
child
she
never
stirs
abroad
unguarded
she
never
hath
from
a
all
the
better
then
we
shall
not
have
far
to
look
for
i
vow
not
i
shall
but
command
her
to
tell
me
the
caitiff
name
that
hath
by
magic
arts
ensnared
her
young
oh
how
foolish
be
the
wise
said
margaret
what
would
ye
go
and
put
her
on
her
guard
nay
let
us
work
by
art
first
and
if
that
fails
then
still
be
time
for
violence
and
margaret
then
with
some
difficulty
prevailed
on
the
mayor
to
take
advantage
of
its
being
saturday
and
pay
all
his
people
their
salaries
in
his
daughter
presence
and
hers
it
was
done
some
fifteen
people
entered
the
room
and
received
their
pay
with
a
kind
word
from
their
employer
then
margaret
who
had
sat
close
to
the
patient
all
the
time
rose
and
went
out
the
mayor
followed
her
sir
how
call
you
yon
lad
that
is
ulrich
my
well
then
is
now
heaven
forbid
a
lad
i
took
out
of
the
well
but
your
worship
is
an
understanding
man
you
took
him
not
up
without
some
merit
of
his
merit
not
a
jot
i
liked
the
looks
of
the
brat
that
was
was
that
no
merit
he
pleased
the
father
eye
and
now
who
had
pleased
the
daughter
that
has
oft
been
seen
since
how
know
ye
is
he
i
held
her
hand
and
with
my
finger
did
lightly
touch
her
wrist
and
when
the
others
came
and
went
was
as
if
dogs
and
cats
had
fared
in
and
out
but
at
this
ulrich
coming
her
pulse
did
leap
and
her
eye
shine
and
when
he
went
she
did
sink
back
and
sigh
and
was
to
be
seen
the
sun
had
gone
out
of
the
room
for
her
nay
burgomaster
look
not
on
me
so
scared
no
witch
or
magician
i
but
a
poor
girl
that
hath
been
docile
and
so
bettered
herself
by
a
great
neglected
leech
art
and
learning
i
tell
ye
all
this
hath
been
done
before
thousands
of
years
ere
we
were
born
now
bide
thou
there
till
i
come
to
thee
and
prithee
prithee
spoil
not
good
work
wi
she
then
went
back
and
asked
her
patient
for
a
lock
of
her
hair
take
it
said
she
more
listlessly
than
ever
why
is
a
lass
of
marble
how
long
do
you
count
to
be
like
that
mistress
till
i
am
in
my
grave
sweet
who
knows
maybe
in
ten
minutes
you
will
be
altogether
as
she
ran
into
the
shop
but
speedily
returned
to
the
mayor
and
said
good
news
he
fancies
her
and
more
than
a
little
now
how
to
be
will
you
marry
your
child
or
bury
her
for
there
is
no
third
way
for
shame
and
love
they
do
rend
her
virgin
heart
to
the
dignitary
decided
for
the
more
cheerful
rite
but
not
without
a
struggle
and
with
its
marks
on
his
face
he
accompanied
margaret
to
his
daughter
but
as
men
are
seldom
in
a
hurry
to
drink
their
wormwood
he
stood
silent
so
doctor
margaret
said
cheerfully
mistress
your
lock
is
gone
i
have
sold
and
who
was
so
mad
as
to
buy
such
a
thing
inquired
the
young
lady
scornfully
oh
a
laddie
wi
white
teeth
they
call
him
the
pale
face
reddened
directly
brow
and
all
says
he
sweet
mistress
give
it
me
i
had
told
them
all
whose
said
i
is
my
livelihood
not
giving
so
he
offered
me
this
he
offered
me
that
but
nought
less
would
i
take
than
his
next
quarter
wages
cruel
murmured
the
girl
scarce
audibly
why
you
are
in
one
tale
with
your
father
says
he
to
me
when
i
told
him
an
he
loves
her
hair
so
well
is
odd
but
he
loves
the
rest
of
her
well
quoth
he
an
honest
lad
and
a
shall
have
her
gien
she
will
but
leave
her
sulks
and
consent
so
what
say
ye
mistress
will
you
be
married
to
ulrich
or
buried
i
the
kirkyard
father
father
is
so
girl
speak
thy
i
will
obey
my
father
in
all
things
stammered
the
poor
girl
trying
hard
to
maintain
the
advantageous
position
in
which
margaret
had
placed
her
but
nature
and
the
joy
and
surprise
were
too
strong
even
for
a
virgin
bashful
cunning
she
cast
an
eloquent
look
on
them
both
and
sank
at
her
father
knees
and
begged
his
pardon
with
many
sobs
for
having
doubted
his
tenderness
he
raised
her
in
his
arms
and
took
her
radiant
through
her
tears
with
joy
and
returning
life
and
filial
love
to
his
breast
and
the
pair
passed
a
truly
sacred
moment
and
the
dignitary
was
as
happy
as
he
thought
to
be
miserable
so
hard
is
it
for
mortals
to
foresee
and
they
looked
round
for
margaret
but
she
had
stolen
away
softly
the
young
girl
searched
the
house
for
her
where
is
she
hid
where
on
earth
is
she
where
was
she
why
in
her
own
house
dressing
meat
for
her
two
old
children
and
crying
bitterly
the
while
at
the
living
picture
of
happiness
she
had
just
created
the
odds
between
her
lot
and
mine
next
time
she
met
the
dignitary
he
hemm
and
hawed
and
remarked
what
a
pity
it
was
the
law
forbade
him
to
pay
her
who
had
cured
his
daughter
however
when
all
is
done
was
not
art
was
but
woman
nought
but
that
burgomaster
said
margaret
bitterly
pay
the
men
of
art
for
not
curing
her
all
the
guerdon
i
seek
that
cured
her
is
this
go
not
and
give
your
foul
linen
away
from
me
by
way
of
why
should
i
inquired
he
marry
because
there
be
fools
about
ye
will
tell
ye
she
that
hath
wit
to
cure
dark
diseases
can
not
have
wit
to
take
dirt
out
o
rags
so
pledge
me
your
the
dignitary
promised
pompously
and
felt
all
the
patron
something
must
be
done
to
fill
box
she
hawked
her
initial
letters
and
her
illuminated
vellums
all
about
the
town
printing
had
by
this
time
dealt
caligraphy
in
black
and
white
a
terrible
blow
in
holland
and
germany
but
some
copies
of
the
printed
books
were
usually
illuminated
and
fettered
the
printers
offered
margaret
prices
for
work
in
these
two
kinds
i
think
o
said
she
she
took
down
her
diurnal
book
and
calculated
that
the
price
of
an
hour
work
on
those
arts
would
be
about
what
she
got
for
an
hour
at
the
tub
and
mangle
i
starve
first
said
she
what
pay
a
craft
and
a
mystery
five
times
less
than
a
handicraft
martin
carrying
the
dry
got
treated
and
drunk
this
time
he
babbled
her
whole
story
the
girls
got
hold
of
it
and
gibed
her
at
the
fountain
all
she
had
gone
through
was
light
to
her
compared
with
the
pins
and
bodkins
her
own
sex
drove
into
her
heart
whenever
she
came
near
the
merry
crew
with
her
pitcher
and
that
was
every
day
each
sex
has
its
form
of
cruelty
man
is
more
brutal
and
terrible
but
shallow
women
that
have
neither
read
nor
suffered
have
an
unmuscular
barbarity
of
their
own
where
no
feeling
of
sex
steps
in
to
overpower
it
this
defect
intellectual
perhaps
rather
than
moral
has
been
mitigated
in
our
day
by
books
especially
by
able
works
of
fiction
for
there
are
two
roads
to
the
highest
effort
of
intelligence
pity
experience
of
sorrows
and
imagination
by
which
alone
we
realize
the
grief
we
never
felt
in
the
fifteenth
century
girls
with
pitchers
had
but
one
experience
and
at
sixteen
years
of
age
or
so
that
road
had
scarce
been
trodden
these
girls
persisted
that
margaret
was
deserted
by
her
lover
and
to
be
deserted
was
a
crime
they
had
not
been
deserted
yet
not
a
word
against
the
gerard
they
had
created
out
of
their
own
heads
for
the
imaginary
crime
they
fell
foul
of
the
supposed
victim
sometimes
they
affronted
her
to
her
face
oftener
they
talked
at
her
backwards
and
forwards
with
a
subtle
skill
and
a
perseverance
which
oh
that
they
had
bestowed
on
the
arts
as
poor
aguecheek
says
now
margaret
was
brave
and
a
coward
brave
to
battle
difficulties
and
ill
fortune
brave
to
shed
her
own
blood
for
those
she
loved
fortitude
she
had
but
she
had
no
true
fighting
courage
she
was
a
powerful
young
woman
rather
tall
full
and
symmetrical
yet
had
one
of
those
slips
of
girls
slapped
her
face
the
poor
fool
hands
would
have
dropped
powerless
or
gone
to
her
own
eyes
instead
of
her
adversary
nor
was
she
even
a
match
for
so
many
tongues
and
besides
what
could
she
say
she
knew
nothing
of
these
girls
except
that
somehow
they
had
found
out
her
sorrows
and
hated
her
only
she
thought
to
herself
they
must
be
very
happy
or
they
would
not
be
so
hard
on
her
so
she
took
their
taunts
in
silence
and
all
her
struggle
was
not
to
let
them
see
their
power
to
make
her
writhe
within
here
came
in
her
fortitude
and
she
received
their
blows
with
icy
hauteur
they
slapped
a
statue
but
one
day
when
her
spirits
were
weak
as
happens
at
times
to
females
in
her
condition
a
dozen
assailants
followed
suit
so
admirably
that
her
whole
sex
seemed
to
the
dispirited
one
to
be
against
her
and
she
lost
heart
and
the
tears
began
to
run
silently
at
each
fresh
stab
on
this
their
triumph
knew
no
bounds
and
they
followed
her
half
way
home
casting
barbed
speeches
after
that
exposure
of
weakness
the
statue
could
be
assumed
no
more
so
then
she
would
stand
timidly
aloof
out
of
till
her
young
tyrants
pitchers
were
all
filled
and
they
gone
and
then
creep
up
with
hers
and
one
day
she
waited
so
long
that
the
fount
had
ceased
to
flow
so
the
next
day
she
was
obliged
to
face
the
phalanx
or
her
house
go
dry
she
drew
near
slowly
but
with
the
less
tremor
that
she
saw
a
man
at
the
well
talking
to
them
he
would
distract
their
attention
and
besides
they
would
keep
their
foul
tongues
quiet
if
only
to
blind
the
male
to
their
real
character
this
conjecture
though
shrewd
was
erroneous
they
could
not
all
flirt
with
that
one
man
so
the
outsiders
indemnified
themselves
by
talking
at
her
the
very
moment
she
came
up
any
news
from
foreign
parts
jacqueline
none
for
me
martha
my
lad
goes
no
farther
from
me
than
the
town
i
ca
say
as
much
says
a
third
but
if
he
goes
t
italy
i
have
got
another
ready
to
take
the
he
not
go
thither
lass
they
go
not
so
far
till
they
are
sick
of
us
that
bide
in
surprise
and
indignation
and
the
presence
of
a
man
gave
margaret
a
moment
fighting
courage
oh
flout
me
not
and
show
your
ill
nature
before
the
very
soldier
in
heaven
name
what
ill
did
i
ever
to
ye
what
harsh
word
cast
back
for
all
you
have
flung
on
me
a
desolate
stranger
in
your
cruel
town
that
ye
flout
me
for
my
bereavement
and
my
poor
lad
most
unwilling
banishment
hearts
of
flesh
would
surely
pity
us
both
for
that
ye
cast
in
my
teeth
these
many
days
ye
brows
of
brass
ye
bosoms
of
they
stared
at
this
novelty
resistance
and
ere
they
could
recover
and
make
mincement
of
her
she
put
her
pitcher
quietly
down
and
threw
her
coarse
apron
over
her
head
and
stood
there
grieving
her
spirit
oozing
fast
hallo
cried
the
soldier
why
what
is
your
ill
she
made
no
reply
but
a
little
girl
who
had
long
secretly
hated
the
big
ones
squeaked
out
they
did
flout
her
they
are
aye
flouting
her
she
may
not
come
nigh
the
fountain
for
fear
o
them
and
is
a
black
who
spoke
to
her
not
i
for
nor
i
would
not
bemean
myself
so
the
man
laughed
heartily
at
this
display
of
dignity
come
wife
said
he
never
lower
thy
flag
to
such
light
skirmishers
as
these
hast
a
tongue
i
thy
head
as
well
as
alack
good
soldier
i
was
not
bred
to
bandy
foul
well
but

a
better
arm
than
these
why
not
take
by
twos
across
thy
knee
and
skelp
till
they
cry
meculpee
nay
i
would
not
hurt
their
bodies
for
all
their
cruel
then
ye
must
laugh
at
them

their
bright
eyes

swamps
there

your
crime

gie
me
thy
pitcher
and
if
they
flout
me
shalt
see
me
scrub
all
wi
my
beard
till
they
squeak
holy
the
pitcher
was
soon
filled
and
the
soldier
put
it
in
margaret
hand
she
murmured
thank
you
kindly
brave
he
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
come

she
let
the
heavy
pitcher

hopped
in
a
circle
saying
no

thief

and
has
broken
my
great
the
apron
came
down
and
there
was
a
lovely
face
all
flushed
emotion
and
two
beaming
eyes
in
front
of
him
and
two
hands
held
out
clasped

will
soon

wet
thy

no
but
the
fair
eyes
were
wet
even
now
looking
kindly
and
gratefully
at
the
friend
that
had
dropped
among
her
foes

if
from

comrade
prithee
come
home
with

good
kind
denys
i
can
not

of
him

they
went
off
together
followed
by
a
chorus
she
has
gotten

man
she
has
gotten
a
man
at
last
boo
boo
boo
margaret
quickened
her
steps
but
denys
took
down
his
crossbow
and
pretended
to
shoot

all
dead

fled

chapter
li
the
reader
already
knows
how
much
these
two
had
to
tell
one
another
it
was
a
sweet
yet
bitter
day
for
margaret
since
it
brought
her
a
true
friend
and
ill
news
for
now
first
she
learned
that
gerard
was
all
alone
in
that
strange
land
she
could
not
think
with
denys
that
he
would
come
home
indeed
he
would
have
arrived
before
this
denys
was
a
balm
he
called
her
his
and
was
always
cheering
her
up
with
his
formula
and
hilarities
and
she
petted
him
and
made
much
of
him
and
feebly
hectored
it
over
him
as
well
as
over
martin
and
would
not
let
him
eat
a
single
meal
out
of
her
house
and
forbade
him
to
use
naughty
words
it
spoils
you
denys
good
lack
to
hear
such
ugly
words
come
forth
so
comely
a
head
forbear
or
i
shall
be
angry
so
be
whereupon
denys
was
upon
his
good
behaviour
and
ludicrous
the
struggle
between
his
native
politeness
and
his
acquired
ruffianism
and
as
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
other
persons
now
solicited
friendship
she
had
written
to
margaret
van
eyck
a
humble
letter
telling
her
she
knew
she
was
no
longer
the
favourite
she
had
been
and
would
keep
her
distance
but
could
not
forget
her
benefactress
past
kindness
she
then
told
her
briefly
how
many
ways
she
had
battled
for
a
living
and
in
conclusion
begged
earnestly
that
her
residence
might
not
be
betrayed
least
of
all
to
his
people
i
do
hate
them
they
drove
him
from
me
and
even
when
he
was
gone
their
hearts
turned
not
to
me
as
they
would
an
if
they
had
repented
their
cruelty
to
the
van
eyck
was
perplexed
at
last
she
made
a
confidante
of
reicht
the
secret
ran
through
reicht
as
through
a
cylinder
to
catherine
ay
and
is
she
turned
that
bitter
against
us
said
that
good
woman
she
stole
our
son
from
us
and
now
she
hates
us
for
not
running
into
her
arms
natheless
it
is
a
blessing
she
is
alive
and
no
farther
away
than
the
english
princess
now
countess
charolois
made
a
stately
progress
through
the
northern
states
of
the
duchy
accompanied
by
her
stepdaughter
the
young
heiress
of
burgundy
marie
de
bourgogne
then
the
old
duke
the
most
magnificent
prince
in
europe
put
out
his
splendour
troops
of
dazzling
knights
and
bevies
of
fair
ladies
gorgeously
attired
attended
the
two
princesses
and
minstrels
jongleurs
or
bards
musicians
actors
tumblers
followed
in
the
train
and
there
was
fencing
dancing
and
joy
in
every
town
they
shone
on
richart
invited
all
his
people
to
meet
him
at
rotterdam
and
view
the
pageant
they
had
been
in
rotterdam
some
days
when
denys
met
catherine
accidentally
in
the
street
and
after
a
warm
greeting
on
both
sides
bade
her
rejoice
for
he
had
found
the
and
crowed
but
catherine
cooled
him
by
showing
him
how
much
earlier
he
would
have
found
her
by
staying
quietly
at
tergou
than
by
vagabondizing
it
all
over
holland
and
being
found
what
the
better
are
we
her
heart
is
set
dead
against
us
oh
let
that
flea
stick
come
you
with
me
to
her
no
she
would
not
go
where
she
was
sure
of
an
ill
welcome
them
that
come
unbidden
sit
no
let
denys
be
mediator
and
bring
the
parties
to
a
good
understanding
he
undertook
the
office
at
once
and
with
great
pomp
and
confidence
he
trotted
off
to
margaret
and
said
i
met
this
day
a
friend
of
thou
didst
look
into
the
rotter
then
and
see
nay
was
a
female
and
one
that
seeks
thy
regard
was
catherine
gerard
oh
was
it
said
margaret
then
you
may
tell
her
she
comes
too
late
there
was
a
time
i
longed
and
longed
for
her
but
she
held
aloof
in
my
hour
of
most
need
so
now
we
will
be
as
we
ha
denys
tried
to
shake
this
resolution
he
coaxed
her
but
she
was
bitter
and
sullen
and
not
to
be
coaxed
then
he
scolded
her
well
then
at
that
she
went
into
hysterics
he
was
frightened
at
this
result
of
his
eloquence
and
being
off
his
guard
allowed
himself
to
be
entrapped
into
a
solemn
promise
never
to
recur
to
the
subject
he
went
back
to
catherine
crestfallen
and
told
her
she
fired
up
and
told
the
family
how
his
overtures
had
been
received
then
they
fired
up
it
became
a
feud
and
burned
fiercer
every
day
little
kate
alone
made
some
excuses
for
margaret
the
very
next
day
another
visitor
came
to
margaret
and
found
the
military
enslaved
and
degraded
martin
up
to
his
elbows
in
soapsuds
and
denys
ironing
very
clumsily
and
margaret
plaiting
ruffs
but
with
a
mistress
eye
on
her
raw
levies
to
these
there
entered
an
old
man
venerable
at
first
sight
but
on
nearer
view
keen
and
wizened
ah
cried
margaret
then
swiftly
turned
her
back
on
him
and
hid
her
face
with
invincible
repugnance
oh
that
man
that
man
nay
fear
me
not
said
ghysbrecht
i
come
on
a
friend
errand
i
bring
ye
a
letter
from
foreign
mock
me
not
old
man
and
she
turned
slowly
round
nay
see
and
he
held
out
an
enormous
letter
margaret
darted
on
it
and
held
it
with
trembling
hands
and
glistening
eyes
it
was
gerard
handwriting
oh
thank
you
sir
bless
you
for
this
i
forgive
you
all
the
ill
you
ever
wrought
and
she
pressed
the
letter
to
her
bosom
with
one
hand
and
glided
swiftly
from
the
room
with
it
as
she
did
not
come
back
ghysbrecht
went
away
but
not
without
a
scowl
at
martha
margaret
was
hours
alone
with
her
letter
chapter
li
when
she
came
down
again
she
was
a
changed
woman
her
eyes
were
wet
but
calm
and
all
her
bitterness
and
excitement
charmed
away
denys
said
she
softly
i
have
got
my
orders
i
am
to
read
my
letter
to
his
ye
will
never
do
that
ay
will
i
see
there
is
something
in
the
letter
has
softened
ye
towards
not
a
jot
denys
not
a
jot
but
an
i
hated
them
like
poison
i
would
not
disobey
my
love
denys
is
so
sweet
to
obey
and
sweetest
of
all
to
obey
one
who
is
far
far
away
and
can
not
enforce
my
duty
but
must
trust
my
love
for
my
obedience
ah
gerard
my
darling
at
hand
i
might
have
slighted
thy
commands
misliking
thy
folk
as
i
have
cause
to
do
but
now
didst
bid
me
go
into
the
raging
sea
and
read
thy
sweet
letter
to
the
sharks
there
i
go
therefore
denys
tell
his
mother
i
have
got
a
letter
and
if
she
and
hers
would
hear
it
i
am
their
servant
let
them
say
their
hour
and
i
seat
them
as
best
i
can
and
welcome
them
as
best
i
denys
went
off
to
catherine
with
this
good
news
he
found
the
family
at
dinner
and
told
them
there
was
a
long
letter
from
gerard
then
in
the
midst
of
the
joy
this
caused
he
said
and
her
heart
is
softened
and
she
will
read
it
to
you
herself
you
are
to
choose
your
own
what
does
she
think
there
are
none
can
read
but
her
asked
catherine
let
her
send
the
letter
and
we
will
read
nay
but
mother
objected
little
kate
mayhap
she
can
not
bear
to
part
it
from
her
hand
she
loves
him
what
thinks
she
we
shall
steal
it
cornelis
suggested
that
she
would
fain
wedge
herself
into
the
family
by
means
of
this
letter
denys
cast
a
look
of
scorn
on
the
speaker
there
spoke
a
bad
heart
said
he
la
camarade
hates
you
all
like
poison
oh

me
not

a

a

denys
the

bless

little

and
her
mellow

and
what

and
terrifying

and
what

while
and
petting

the
crawlingest

instant

and
hear
it
read
will
ye
not
else
our
hearts
were
black
as
coal
said
catherine
so
denys
went
for
the
letter
he
came
back
crestfallen
she
will
not
let
it
out
of
her
hand
neither
to
me
nor
you
nor
any
he
or
she
that
i
knew
she
would
not
said
cornelis
whisht
whisht
said
eli
and
let
denys
tell
his
said
i
be
ruled
by
me
i
quoth
she
but
quoth
i
same
honey
obedience
ye
spake
of
are
a
fool
says
she
to
gerard
is
sweet
but
obedience
to
any
other
body
who
ever
said
that
was
sweet
at
last
she
seemed
to
soften
a
bit
and
did
give
me
a
written
paper
for
you
mademoiselle
here
is
for
me
said
little
kate
colouring
give
that
here
said
eli
and
he
scanned
the
writing
and
said
almost
in
a
whisper
these
be
words
from
the
letter
hearken
sweetheart
an
if
these
lines
should
travel
safe
to
thee
make
thou
trial
of
my
people
hearts
withal
maybe
they
are
somewhat
turned
towards
me
being
far
away
if
is
so
they
will
show
it
to
thee
since
now
to
me
they
may
not
read
then
this
letter
but
i
do
strictly
forbid
thee
to
let
it
from
thy
hand
and
if
they
still
hold
aloof
from
thee
why
then
say
nought
but
let
them
think
me
dead
obey
me
in
this
for
if
thou
dost
disrespect
my
judgment
and
my
will
in
this
thou
lovest
me
not
there
was
a
silence
and
gerard
words
copied
by
margaret
here
handed
round
and
inspected
well
said
catherine
that
is
another
matter
but
methinks
is
for
her
to
come
to
us
not
we
to
alas
mother
what
odds
does
that
make
much
said
eli
tell
her
we
are
over
many
to
come
to
her
and
bid
her
hither
the
sooner
the
when
denys
was
gone
eli
owned
it
was
a
bitter
pill
to
him
when
that
lass
shall
cross
my
threshold
all
the
mischief
and
misery
she
hath
made
here
will
seem
to
come
in
adoors
in
one
heap
but
what
could
i
do
wife
we
must
hear
the
news
of
gerard
i
saw
that
in
thine
eyes
and
felt
it
in
my
own
heart
and
she
is
backed
by
our
undutiful
but
still
beloved
son
and
so
is
she
stronger
than
we
and
brings
our
noses
down
to
the
grindstone
the
sly
cruel
jade
but
never
heed
we
will
hear
the
letter
and
then
let
her
go
unblessed
as
she
came
make
your
mind
easy
said
catherine
she
will
not
come
at
and
a
tone
of
regret
was
visible
shortly
after
richart
who
had
been
hourly
expected
arrived
from
amsterdam
grave
and
dignified
in
his
burgher
robe
and
gold
chain
ruff
and
furred
cap
and
was
received
not
with
affection
only
but
respect
for
he
had
risen
a
step
higher
than
his
parents
and
such
steps
were
marked
in
mediaeval
society
almost
as
visibly
as
those
in
their
staircases
admitted
in
due
course
to
the
family
council
he
showed
plainly
though
not
discourteously
that
his
pride
was
deeply
wounded
by
their
having
deigned
to
treat
with
margaret
brandt
i
see
the
temptation
said
he
but
which
of
us
hath
not
at
times
to
wish
one
way
and
do
another
this
threw
a
considerable
chill
over
the
old
people
so
little
kate
put
in
a
word
vex
not
thyself
dear
richart
mother
says
she
will
not
come
all
the
better
sweetheart
i
fear
me
if
she
do
i
shall
hie
me
back
to
here
denys
popped
his
head
in
at
the
door
and
said
she
will
be
here
at
three
on
the
great
they
all
looked
at
one
another
in
silence
anglice
a
chapter
liii
nay
richart
said
catherine
at
last
for
heaven
sake
let
not
this
one
sorry
wench
set
us
all
by
the
ears
hath
she
not
made
ill
blood
enough
already
in
very
deed
she
hath
fear
me
not
good
mother
let
her
come
and
read
the
letter
of
the
poor
boy
she
hath
by
devilish
arts
bewitched
and
then
let
her
go
give
me
your
words
to
show
her
no
countenance
beyond
decent
and
constrained
civility
less
we
may
not
being
in
our
own
house
and
i
will
say
no
on
this
understanding
they
waited
the
foe
she
for
her
part
prepared
for
the
interview
in
a
spirit
little
less
hostile
when
denys
brought
word
they
would
not
come
to
her
but
would
receive
her
her
lip
curled
and
she
bade
him
observe
how
in
them
every
feeling
however
small
was
larger
than
the
love
for
gerard
well
said
she
i
have
not
that
excuse
so
why
mimic
the
pretty
burgher
pride
the
pride
of
all
unlettered
folk
i
will
go
to
them
for
gerard
sake
oh
how
i
loathe
them
thus
poor
denys
was
bringing
into
one
house
the
materials
of
an
explosion
margaret
made
her
toilet
in
the
same
spirit
that
a
knight
of
her
day
dressed
for
battle
he
to
parry
blows
and
she
to
parry
glances
glances
of
contempt
at
her
poverty
or
of
irony
at
her
extravagance
her
kirtle
was
of
english
cloth
dark
blue
and
her
farthingale
and
hose
of
the
same
material
but
a
glossy
roan
or
claret
colour
not
an
inch
of
pretentious
fur
about
her
but
plain
snowy
linen
wristbands
and
curiously
plaited
linen
from
the
bosom
of
the
kirtle
up
to
the
commencement
of
the
throat
it
did
not
encircle
her
throat
but
framed
it
being
square
not
round
her
front
hair
still
peeped
in
two
waves
much
after
the
fashion
which
mary
queen
of
scots
revived
a
century
later
but
instead
of
the
silver
net
which
would
have
ill
become
her
present
condition
the
rest
of
her
head
was
covered
with
a
very
small
hood
of
dark
blue
cloth
hemmed
with
silver
her
shoes
were
red
but
the
roan
petticoat
and
hose
prepared
the
spectator
mind
for
the
shock
and
they
set
off
the
arched
instep
and
shapely
foot
beauty
knew
its
business
then
as
now
and
with
all
this
she
kept
her
enemies
waiting
though
it
was
three
by
the
dial
at
last
she
started
attended
by
her
and
when
they
were
halfway
she
stopped
and
said
thoughtfully
denys
well
i
must
go
home
piteously
what
have
ye
left
somewhat
behind
what
my
courage
oh
oh
oh
nay
nay
be
brave
i
shall
be
with
ay
but
wilt
keep
close
to
me
when
i
be
there
denys
promised
and
she
resumed
her
march
but
gingerly
meantime
they
were
all
assembled
and
waiting
for
her
with
a
strange
mixture
of
feelings
mortification
curiosity
panting
affection
aversion
to
her
who
came
to
gratify
those
feelings
yet
another
curiosity
to
see
what
she
was
like
and
what
there
was
in
her
to
bewitch
gerard
and
make
so
much
mischief
at
last
denys
came
alone
and
whispered
the
is
fetch
her
in
said
eli
now
whisht
all
of
ye
none
speak
to
her
but
they
all
turned
their
eyes
to
the
door
in
dead
silence
a
little
muttering
was
heard
outside
denys
rough
organ
and
a
soft
and
mellow
voice
presently
that
stopped
and
then
the
door
opened
slowly
and
margaret
brandt
dressed
as
i
have
described
and
somewhat
pale
but
calm
and
lovely
stood
on
the
threshold
looking
straight
before
her
they
all
rose
but
kate
and
remained
mute
and
staring
be
seated
mistress
said
eli
gravely
and
motioned
to
a
seat
that
had
been
set
apart
for
her
she
inclined
her
head
and
crossed
the
apartment
and
in
so
doing
her
condition
was
very
visible
not
only
in
her
shape
but
in
her
languor
cornelis
and
sybrandt
hated
her
for
it
richart
thought
it
spoiled
her
beauty
it
softened
the
women
somewhat
she
took
her
letter
out
of
her
bosom
and
kissed
it
as
if
she
had
been
alone
then
disposed
herself
to
read
it
with
the
air
of
one
who
knew
she
was
there
for
that
single
purpose
but
as
she
began
she
noticed
they
had
seated
her
all
by
herself
like
a
leper
she
looked
at
denys
and
putting
her
hand
down
by
her
side
made
him
a
swift
furtive
motion
to
come
by
her
he
went
with
an
obedient
start
as
if
she
had
cried
march
and
stood
at
her
shoulder
like
a
sentinel
but
this
zealous
manner
of
doing
it
revealed
to
the
company
that
he
had
been
ordered
thither
and
at
that
she
coloured
and
now
she
began
to
read
her
gerard
their
gerard
to
their
eager
ears
in
a
mellow
clear
voice
so
soft
so
earnest
so
thrilling
her
very
soul
seemed
to
cling
about
each
precious
sound
it
was
a
voice
as
of
a
woman
bosom
set
speaking
by
heaven
itself
i
do
nothing
doubt
my
margaret
that
long
ere
this
shall
meet
thy
beloved
eyes
denys
my
most
dear
friend
will
have
sought
thee
out
and
told
thee
the
manner
of
our
unlooked
for
and
most
tearful
parting
therefore
i
will
begin
at
that
most
doleful
day
what
befell
him
after
poor
faithful
soul
fain
fain
would
i
hear
but
may
not
but
i
pray
for
him
day
and
night
next
after
thee
dearest
friend
more
stanch
and
loving
had
not
david
in
jonathan
than
i
in
him
be
good
to
him
for
poor
gerard
at
these
words
which
came
quite
unexpectedly
to
him
denys
leaned
his
head
on
margaret
high
chair
and
groaned
aloud
she
turned
quickly
as
she
sat
and
found
his
hand
and
pressed
it
and
so
the
sweetheart
and
the
friend
held
hands
while
the
sweetheart
read
i
went
forward
all
dizzied
like
one
in
an
ill
dream
and
presently
a
gentleman
came
up
with
his
servants
all
on
horseback
and
had
liked
to
have
rid
me
and
he
drew
rein
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
sent
his
armed
men
back
to
rob
me
they
robbed
me
civilly
enough
and
took
my
purse
and
the
last
copper
and
rid
gaily
away
i
wandered
stupid
on
a
friendless
there
was
a
general
sigh
followed
by
an
oath
from
denys
presently
a
strange
dimness
came
me
i
lay
down
to
sleep
on
the
snow
was
ill
done
and
with
store
of
wolves
hard
by
had
i
loved
thee
as
thou
dost
deserve
i
had
shown
more
manhood
but
oh
sweet
love
the
drowsiness
that
did
crawl
me
desolate
and
benumb
me
was
more
than
nature
and
so
i
slept
and
but
that
god
was
better
to
us
than
i
to
thee
or
to
myself
from
that
sleep
i
had
waked
so
all
do
say
i
had
slept
an
hour
or
two
as
i
suppose
but
no
more
when
a
hand
did
shake
me
rudely
i
awoke
to
my
troubles
and
there
stood
a
servant
girl
in
her
holiday
suit
ye
mad
quoth
she
in
seeming
choler
sleep
in
snow
and
under
wolves
nosen
art
weary
o
life
and
not
long
weaned
come
now
said
she
more
kindly
up
like
a
good
lad
so
i
did
rise
up
ye
rich
or
are
ye
poor
but
i
stared
at
her
as
one
amazed
is
easy
of
reply
quoth
she
ye
rich
or
are
ye
poor
then
i
gave
a
great
loud
cry
that
she
did
start
back
i
rich
or
am
i
poor
had
ye
asked
me
an
hour
agone
i
had
said
i
am
rich
but
now
i
am
so
poor
as
sure
earth
beareth
on
her
bosom
none
poorer
an
hour
agone
i
was
rich
in
a
friend
rich
in
money
rich
in
hope
and
spirits
of
youth
but
now
the
bastard
of
burgundy
hath
taken
my
friend
and
another
gentleman
my
purse
and
i
can
neither
go
forward
to
rome
nor
back
to
her
i
left
in
holland
i
am
poorest
of
the
poor
said
the
wench
an
ye
had
been
rich
ye
might
ha
lain
down
again
in
the
snow
for
any
use
i
had
for
ye
and
then
i
trow
ye
had
soon
fared
out
o
this
world
as
bare
as
ye
came
into
it
but
being
poor
you
are
our
man
so
come
wi
me
then
i
went
because
she
bade
me
and
because
i
recked
not
now
whither
i
went
and
she
took
me
to
a
fine
house
hard
by
and
into
a
noble
hung
with
black
and
there
was
set
a
table
with
many
dishes
and
but
one
plate
and
one
chair
to
said
she
in
a
whisper
alone
said
i
and
which
of
us
think
ye
would
eat
out
of
the
same
dish
with
ye
are
we
robbers
o
the
dead
then
she
speered
where
i
was
born
tergou
said
i
says
she
when
a
gentleman
dies
in
that
country
serve
they
not
the
dead
dinner
up
as
usual
till
he
be
in
the
ground
and
set
some
poor
man
to
it
i
told
her
she
blushed
for
us
then
here
they
were
better
christians
so
i
behoved
to
sit
down
but
small
was
my
heart
for
meat
then
this
kind
lass
sat
by
me
and
poured
me
out
wine
and
tasting
it
it
cut
me
to
the
heart
denys
was
not
there
to
drink
with
me
he
doth
so
love
good
wine
and
women
good
bad
or
indifferent
the
rich
strong
wine
curled
round
my
sick
heart
and
that
day
first
i
did
seem
to
glimpse
why
folk
in
trouble
run
to
drink
so
she
made
me
eat
of
every
dish
unlucky
to
pass
one
nought
was
here
but
her
master
daily
dinner
had
a
good
stomach
then
said
i
lad
and
a
good
heart
leastways
so
we
all
say
now
he
is
dead
but
being
alive
no
word
o
heard
i
so
i
did
eat
as
a
bird
nibbling
of
every
dish
and
she
hearing
me
sigh
and
seeing
me
like
to
choke
at
the
food
took
pity
and
bade
me
be
of
good
cheer
i
should
sup
and
lie
there
that
night
and
she
went
to
the
hind
and
he
gave
me
a
right
good
bed
and
i
told
him
all
and
asked
him
would
the
law
give
me
back
my
purse
quoth
he
there
was
none
for
the
poor
in
burgundy
why
was
the
cousin
of
the
lady
of
the
manor
he
that
had
robbed
me
he
knew
the
wild
spark
the
matter
must
be
judged
before
the
lady
and
she
was
quite
young
and
far
more
like
to
hang
me
for
slandering
her
cousin
and
a
gentleman
and
a
handsome
man
than
to
make
him
give
me
back
my
own
inside
the
liberties
of
a
town
a
poor
man
might
now
and
then
see
the
face
of
justice
but
out
among
the
grand
seigneurs
and
dames
never
so
i
said
sit
down
robbed
rather
than
seek
justice
and
find
gallows
they
were
all
most
kind
to
me
next
day
and
the
girl
proffered
me
money
from
her
small
wage
to
help
me
towards
oh
then
he
is
coming
home
he
is
coming
home
shouted
denys
interrupting
the
reader
she
shook
her
head
gently
at
him
by
way
of
reproof
i
beg
pardon
all
the
company
said
he
stiffly
was
a
sore
temptation
but
being
a
servant
my
stomach
rose
against
it
nay
said
i
she
told
me
i
was
wrong
pride
out
place
poor
folk
should
help
one
another
or
who
on
earth
would
i
said
if
i
could
do
aught
in
return
well
but
for
a
free
gift
nay
i
was
overmuch
beholden
already
should
i
write
a
letter
for
her
he
is
in
the
house
at
present
said
she
i
draw
her
picture
and
so
earn
my
money
can
ye
said
she
i
told
her
i
could
try
and
her
habit
would
well
become
a
picture
so
she
was
agog
to
be
limned
and
give
it
her
lad
and
i
set
her
to
stand
in
a
good
light
and
soon
made
sketches
two
whereof
i
send
thee
one
coloured
at
odd
hours
the
other
i
did
most
hastily
and
with
little
conscience
daub
for
which
may
heaven
forgive
me
but
time
was
short
they
poor
things
knew
no
better
and
were
most
proud
and
joyous
and
both
kissing
me
after
their
country
fashion
was
the
hind
that
was
her
sweetheart
they
did
bid
me
and
i
towards
margaret
paused
here
and
gave
denys
the
coloured
drawing
to
hand
round
it
was
eagerly
examined
by
the
females
on
account
of
the
costume
which
differed
in
some
respects
from
that
of
the
dutch
domestic
the
hair
was
in
a
tight
linen
bag
a
yellow
half
kerchief
crossed
her
head
from
ear
to
ear
but
threw
out
a
rectangular
point
that
descended
the
centre
of
her
forehead
and
it
met
in
two
more
points
over
her
bosom
she
wore
a
red
kirtle
with
long
sleeves
kilted
very
high
in
front
and
showing
a
green
farthingale
and
a
great
red
leather
purse
hanging
down
over
it
red
stockings
yellow
leathern
shoes
ahead
of
her
age
for
they
were
and
secured
by
a
strap
buckling
over
the
instep
which
was
not
uncommon
and
was
perhaps
the
rude
germ
of
the
diamond
buckle
to
come
margaret
continued
but
oh
how
i
missed
my
denys
at
every
step
often
i
sat
down
on
the
road
and
groaned
and
in
the
afternoon
it
chanced
that
i
did
so
set
me
down
where
two
roads
met
and
with
heavy
head
in
hand
and
heavy
heart
did
think
of
thee
my
poor
sweetheart
and
of
my
lost
friend
and
of
the
little
house
at
tergou
where
they
all
loved
me
once
though
now
it
is
turned
to
catherine
alas
that
he
will
think
eli
whisht
wife
and
i
did
sigh
loud
and
often
and
me
sighing
so
one
came
carolling
like
a
bird
adown
t
other
road
chirp
and
chirp
cried
i
bitterly
has
not
lost
sweetheart
and
friend
thy
hearth
thy
mother
smile
and
every
penny
in
the
world
and
at
last
he
did
so
carol
and
carol
i
jumped
up
in
ire
to
get
away
from
his
most
jarring
mirth
but
ere
i
lied
from
it
i
looked
down
the
path
to
see
what
could
make
a
man
so
lighthearted
in
this
weary
world
and
lo
the
songster
was
a
humpbacked
cripple
with
a
bloody
bandage
his
eye
and
both
legs
gone
at
the
he
he
he
he
he
went
sybrandt
laughing
and
cackling
margaret
eyes
flashed
she
began
to
fold
the
letter
up
nay
lass
said
eli
heed
him
not
thou
unmannerly
cur
but
again
and
i
put
thee
to
the
why
what
was
there
to
gibe
at
sybrandt
remonstrated
catherine
more
mildly
is
not
our
kate
afflicted
and
is
she
not
the
most
content
of
us
all
and
singeth
like
a
merle
at
times
between
her
pains
but
i
am
as
bad
as
thou
prithee
read
on
lass
and
stop
our
gabble
wi
somewhat
worth
the
said
i
this
thing
be
and
i
took
myself
to
task
son
of
eli
dost
thou
well
to
bemoan
thy
lot
thou
hast
youth
and
health
and
here
comes
the
wreck
of
nature
on
crutches
praising
god
goodness
with
singing
like
a
mavis
catherine
there
you
eli
whisht
dame
whisht
and
whenever
he
saw
me
he
left
carolling
and
presently
hobbled
up
and
chanted
for
love
of
heaven
sweet
master
charity
with
a
whine
as
piteous
as
wind
at
keyhole
poor
soul
said
i
is
in
my
heart
but
not
my
purse
i
am
poor
as
thou
then
he
believed
me
none
and
to
melt
me
undid
his
sleeve
and
showed
a
sore
wound
on
his
arm
and
said
he
cripple
though
i
be
i
am
like
to
lose
this
eye
to
boot
look
else
i
saw
and
groaned
for
him
and
to
excuse
myself
let
him
wot
how
i
had
been
robbed
of
my
last
copper
thereat
he
left
whining
all
in
a
moment
and
said
in
a
big
manly
voice
i
take
a
rest
here
youngster
pull
thou
this
strap
nay
fear
not
i
pulled
and
down
came
a
stout
pair
of
legs
out
of
his
back
and
half
his
hump
had
melted
away
and
the
wound
in
his
eye
no
deeper
than
the
bandage
oh
ejaculated
margaret
hearers
in
a
body
whereat
seeing
me
astounded
he
laughed
in
my
face
and
told
me
i
was
not
worth
gulling
and
offered
me
his
protection
face
was
prophetic
he
said
what
said
i
said
he
its
owner
will
starve
in
this
thievish
land
travel
teaches
the
young
wisdom
time
was
i
had
turned
and
fled
this
impostor
as
a
pestilence
but
now
i
listened
patiently
to
pick
up
crumbs
of
counsel
and
well
i
did
for
nature
and
his
adventurous
life
had
crammed
the
poor
knave
with
shrewdness
and
knowledge
of
the
homelier
sort
a
child
was
i
beside
him
when
he
had
turned
me
inside
out
said
he
well
to
leave
france
and
make
for
germany
but
think
not
of
holland
again
nay
on
to
augsburg
and
nurnberg
the
paradise
of
craftsmen
thence
to
venice
an
thou
wilt
but
thou
wilt
never
bide
in
italy
nor
any
other
land
having
once
tasted
the
great
german
cities
why
there
is
but
one
honest
country
in
europe
and
that
is
germany
and
since
thou
art
honest
and
since
i
am
a
vagabone
germany
was
made
for
us
twain
i
bade
him
make
that
good
how
might
one
country
fit
true
men
and
knaves
thou
novice
said
he
in
an
honest
land
are
fewer
knaves
to
bite
the
honest
man
and
many
honest
men
for
the
knave
to
bite
i
was
in
luck
being
honest
to
have
fallen
in
with
a
friendly
sharp
be
my
pal
said
he
go
to
nurnberg
we
will
reach
it
with
full
pouches
learn
ye
the
cul
de
bois
and
the
cul
de
jatte
and
how
to
maund
and
chaunt
and
patter
and
to
raise
swellings
and
paint
sores
and
ulcers
on
thy
body
would
take
in
the
divell
i
told
him
shivering
i
liever
die
than
shame
myself
and
my
folk
eli
good
lad
good
lad
why
what
shame
was
it
for
such
as
i
to
turn
beggar
beggary
was
an
ancient
and
most
honourable
mystery
what
did
holy
monks
and
bishops
and
kings
when
they
would
win
heaven
smile
why
wash
the
feet
of
beggars
those
favourites
of
the
saints
saints
were
no
fools
he
told
me
then
he
did
put
out
his
foot
at
that
that
was
washed
by
the
greatest
king
alive
louis
of
france
the
last
holy
thursday
that
was
and
the
next
day
friday
clapped
in
the
stocks
by
the
warden
of
a
petty
hamlet
so
i
told
him
my
foot
should
walk
between
such
high
honour
and
such
low
disgrace
on
the
same
path
of
honesty
please
god
well
then
since
i
had
not
spirit
to
beg
he
would
indulge
my
perversity
i
should
work
under
him
he
be
the
head
i
the
fingers
and
with
that
he
set
himself
up
like
a
judge
on
a
heap
of
dust
by
the
road
side
and
questioned
me
strictly
what
i
could
do
i
began
to
say
i
was
strong
and
willing
said
he
is
an
ox
say
what
canst
do
that
sir
ox
can
not
i
could
write
i
had
won
a
prize
for
it
write
as
fast
as
the
printers
quo
he
jeering
else
i
could
paint
was
better
i
was
like
to
tear
my
hair
to
hear
him
say
so
and
me
going
to
rome
to
write
i
could
twang
the
psaltery
a
bit
was
well
could
i
tell
stories
ay
by
the
score
said
he
hire
you
from
this
moment
to
do
said
i
crooked
sir
candour
says
he
will
feed
thee
all
the
way
and
find
thee
work
and
take
half
thine
earnings
no
more
said
i
and
gave
my
hand
on
it
servant
said
he
will
dine
but
ye
need
not
stand
behind
my
chair
for
two
reasons
first
i
ha
got
no
chair
and
next
good
fellowship
likes
me
better
than
state
and
out
of
his
wallet
he
brought
flesh
fowl
and
pastry
a
good
dozen
of
spices
lapped
in
flax
paper
and
wine
fit
for
a
king
feasted
i
better
than
out
of
this
beggar
wallet
now
my
master
when
we
had
well
eaten
i
was
for
going
on
said
he
should
not
drive
their
masters
too
hard
especially
after
feeding
for
then
the
body
is
for
repose
and
the
mind
turns
to
contemplation
and
he
lay
on
his
back
gazing
calmly
at
the
sky
and
presently
wondered
whether
there
were
any
beggars
up
there
i
told
him
i
knew
but
of
one
called
lazarus
he
do
the
cul
de
jatte
better
than
i
said
he
and
looked
quite
jealous
like
i
told
him
nay
lazarus
was
honest
though
a
beggar
and
fed
daily
of
the
crumbs
from
a
rich
man
table
and
the
dogs
licked
his
sores
quo
he
spy
a
foul
fault
in
thee
thou
liest
without
discretion
now
the
end
of
lying
being
to
gull
this
is
no
better
than
fumbling
with
the
divell
tail
i
pray
heaven
thou
mayest
prove
to
paint
better
than
thou
cuttest
whids
or
i
am
done
out
of
a
dinner
no
beggar
eats
crumbs
but
only
the
fat
of
the
land
and
dogs
lick
not
a
beggar
sores
being
made
with
spearwort
or
ratsbane
or
biting
acids
from
all
which
dogs
and
even
pigs
abhor
my
sores
are
made
after
my
proper
receipt
but
no
dog
would
lick
them
twice
i
have
made
a
scurvy
bargain
art
a
cozening
knave
i
doubt
as
well
as
a
nincompoop
i
deigned
no
reply
to
this
bundle
of
lies
which
did
accuse
heavenly
truth
of
falsehood
for
not
being
in
a
tale
with
him
he
rose
and
we
took
the
road
and
presently
we
came
to
a
place
where
were
two
little
wayside
inns
scarce
a
furlong
apart
said
my
master
armories
are
sore
faded
all
the
better
go
thou
in
shun
the
master
board
the
wife
and
flatter
her
inn
sky
high
all
but
the
armories
and
offer
to
colour
them
dirt
cheap
so
i
went
in
and
told
the
wife
i
was
a
painter
and
would
revive
her
armories
cheap
but
she
sent
me
away
with
a
rebuff
i
to
my
master
he
groaned
are
all
fingers
and
no
tongue
said
he
have
made
a
scurvy
bargain
come
and
hear
me
patter
and
flatter
between
the
two
inns
was
a
high
hedge
he
goes
behind
it
a
minute
and
comes
out
a
decent
tradesman
we
went
on
to
the
other
inn
and
then
i
heard
him
praise
it
so
fulsome
as
the
very
wife
did
blush
says
he
is
one
little
little
fault
your
armories
are
dull
and
faded
say
but
the
word
and
for
a
silver
franc
my
apprentice
here
the
cunningest
i
had
shall
make
them
bright
as
ever
whilst
she
hesitated
the
rogue
told
her
he
had
done
it
to
a
little
inn
hard
by
and
now
the
inn
face
was
like
the
starry
firmament
d
hear
that
my
man
cries
she
the
three
frogs
have
been
and
painted
up
their
armories
shall
the
four
hedgehogs
be
outshone
by
them
so
i
painted
and
my
master
stood
by
like
a
lord
advising
me
how
to
do
and
winking
to
me
to
heed
him
none
and
i
got
a
silver
franc
and
he
took
me
back
to
three
frogs
and
on
the
way
put
me
on
a
beard
and
disguised
me
and
flattered
three
frogs
and
told
them
how
he
had
adorned
four
hedgehogs
and
into
the
net
jumped
the
three
poor
simple
frogs
and
i
earned
another
silver
franc
then
we
went
on
and
he
found
his
crutches
and
sent
me
forward
and
showed
his
cicatrices
as
he
called
them
and
all
his
infirmities
at
four
hedgehogs
and
got
both
food
and
money
share
and
share
quoth
he
so
i
gave
him
one
franc
have
made
a
good
bargain
said
he
a
master
limner
but
takest
too
much
time
so
i
let
him
know
that
in
matters
of
honest
craft
things
could
not
be
done
quick
and
well
do
them
quick
quoth
he
and
he
told
me
my
name
was
bon
bec
and
i
might
call
him
cul
de
jatte
because
that
was
his
lay
at
our
first
meeting
and
at
the
next
town
my
master
cul
de
jatte
bought
me
a
psaltery
and
set
himself
up
again
by
the
roadside
in
state
like
him
that
erst
judged
marsyas
and
apollo
piping
for
vain
glory
so
i
played
a
strain
well
harmonious
bon
bec
said
he
haughtily
tune
thy
pipes
so
i
did
sing
a
sweet
strain
the
good
monks
taught
me
and
singing
it
reminded
poor
bon
bec
gerard
erst
of
his
young
days
and
home
and
brought
the
water
to
my
een
but
looking
up
my
master
visage
was
as
the
face
of
a
little
boy
whipt
soundly
or
sipping
foulest
medicine
stop
that
bellyache
blether
quoth
he
will
wile
a
stiver
out
o
peasants
purses
but
sour
the
nurses
milk
and
gar
the
kine
jump
into
rivers
to
be
out
of
earshot
o
what
false
knave
did
i
buy
thee
a
fine
new
psaltery
to
be
minded
o
my
latter
end
withal
hearken
these
be
the
songs
that
glad
the
heart
and
fill
the
minstrel
purse
and
he
sung
so
blasphemous
a
stave
and
eke
so
obscene
as
i
drew
away
from
him
a
space
that
the
lightning
might
not
spoil
the
new
psaltery
however
none
came
being
winter
and
then
i
said
the
lord
is
debonair
held
i
the
thunder
yon
ribaldry
had
been
thy
last
thou
wretch
bon
bec
what
is
to
do
quoth
he
have
made
an
ill
bargain
oh
perverse
heart
that
turneth
from
doctrine
so
i
bade
him
keep
his
breath
to
cool
his
broth
would
i
shame
my
folk
with
singing
ribald
songs
says
he
sulkily
first
fire
we
light
by
the
wayside
clap
thou
on
the
music
box
so
make
our
pot
boil
for
the
nonce
but
with
your
good
people
let
us
peak
and
pine
cut
tristful
mugs
and
miaul
and
whine
thorough
our
nosen
chaunts
divine
never
never
never
ye
might
as
well
go
through
lorraine
crying
mulleygrubs
mulleygrubs
who
buy
my
mulleygrubs
so
we
fared
on
bad
friends
but
i
took
a
thought
and
prayed
him
hum
me
one
of
his
naughty
ditties
again
then
he
brightened
and
broke
forth
into
ribaldry
like
a
nightingale
finger
in
ears
stuffed
i
words
naught
but
the
bare
melody
for
oh
margaret
note
the
sly
malice
of
the
evil
one
still
to
the
scurviest
matter
he
wedded
the
tunablest
catherine
that
is
true
as
holy
sybrandt
how
know
you
that
mother
cornelis
he
he
he
eli
whisht
ye
uneasy
wights
and
let
me
hear
the
boy
he
is
wiser
than
ye
wiser
than
his
tomfoolery
is
this
said
he
yet
he
yielded
to
me
and
soon
i
garnered
three
of
his
melodies
but
i
would
not
let
cul
de
jatte
wot
the
thing
i
meditated
not
fools
nor
bairns
unfinished
work
saith
the
byword
and
by
this
time
was
night
and
a
little
town
at
hand
where
we
went
each
to
his
inn
for
my
master
would
not
yield
to
put
off
his
rags
and
other
sores
till
morning
nor
i
to
enter
an
inn
with
a
tatterdemalion
so
we
were
to
meet
on
the
road
at
peep
of
day
and
indeed
we
still
lodged
apart
meeting
at
morn
and
parting
at
eve
outside
each
town
we
lay
at
and
waking
at
midnight
and
cogitating
good
thoughts
came
down
to
me
and
sudden
my
heart
was
enlightened
i
called
to
mind
that
my
margaret
had
withstood
the
taking
of
the
purse
theft
said
you
it
how
ye
will
but
i
must
be
wiser
than
my
betters
and
now
that
which
i
had
as
good
as
stolen
others
had
stolen
from
me
as
it
came
so
it
was
gone
then
i
said
is
not
cruel
but
just
and
i
vowed
a
vow
to
repay
our
burgomaster
every
shilling
an
i
could
and
i
went
forth
in
the
morning
sad
but
hopeful
i
felt
lighter
for
the
purse
being
gone
my
master
was
at
the
gate
becrutched
i
told
him
i
liever
have
seen
him
in
another
disguise
must
not
be
choosers
said
he
however
soon
he
bade
me
untruss
him
for
he
felt
sadly
his
head
swam
i
told
him
forcefully
to
deform
nature
thus
could
scarce
be
wholesome
he
answered
none
but
looked
scared
and
hand
on
head
he
gave
a
groan
and
rolled
on
the
ground
like
a
ball
and
writhed
sore
i
was
scared
and
wist
not
what
to
do
but
went
to
lift
him
but
his
trouble
rose
higher
and
higher
he
gnashed
his
teeth
fearfully
and
the
foam
did
fly
from
his
lips
and
presently
his
body
bended
itself
like
a
bow
and
jerked
and
bounded
many
times
into
the
air
i
exorcised
him
it
but
made
him
worse
there
was
water
in
a
ditch
hard
by
not
very
clear
but
the
poor
creature
struggling
between
life
and
death
i
filled
my
hat
withal
and
came
flying
to
souse
him
then
my
lord
laughed
in
my
face
bon
bec
by
thy
white
gills
i
have
not
forgotten
my
trade
i
stood
with
watery
hat
in
hand
glaring
this
be
feigning
else
said
he
a
real
fit
is
the
sorriest
thing
but
a
stroke
with
a
feather
compared
with
mine
art
still
betters
nature
look
now
blood
trickleth
from
your
nose
said
i
ay
pricked
my
nostrils
with
a
straw
ye
foamed
at
the
lips
a
little
soap
makes
a
mickle
foam
and
he
drew
out
a
morsel
like
a
bean
from
his
mouth
thy
stars
bon
bec
says
he
leading
thee
to
a
worthy
master
each
day
his
lesson
we
will
study
the
cul
de
bois
and
other
branches
own
me
prince
of
demoniacs
and
indeed
of
all
good
fellows
then
being
puffed
up
he
forgot
yesterday
grudge
and
discoursed
me
freely
of
beggars
and
gave
me
who
eftsoons
thought
a
beggar
was
a
beggar
and
there
an
end
the
names
and
qualities
of
full
thirty
sorts
of
masterful
and
crafty
mendicants
in
france
and
germany
and
england
his
three
provinces
for
so
the
poor
proud
knave
yclept
those
kingdoms
three
wherein
his
throne
it
was
the
stocks
i
ween
and
outside
the
next
village
one
had
gone
to
dinner
and
left
his
wheelbarrow
so
says
he
tie
myself
in
a
knot
and
shalt
wheel
me
through
and
what
with
my
crippledom
and
thy
piety
of
thy
poor
old
dad
we
bleed
the
bumpkins
of
a
i
did
refuse
i
would
work
for
him
but
no
hand
would
have
in
begging
wheeling
an
asker
in
a
barrow
is
not
that
work
said
he
fling
yon
muckle
stone
in
to
boot
stay
i
soil
it
a
bit
and
swear
it
is
a
chip
of
the
holy
sepulchre
and
you
wheeled
us
both
from
jerusalem
said
i
a
pair
o
lies
one
stony
one
fleshy
may
be
work
and
hard
work
but
honest
work
is
not
is
fumbling
with
his
tail
you
wot
of
and
said
i
next
time
you
go
to
tempt
me
to
knavery
speak
not
to
me
of
my
poor
old
dad
said
i
have
minded
me
of
my
real
father
face
the
truest
man
in
holland
he
and
i
are
ill
friends
now
worse
luck
but
though
i
offend
him
shame
him
i
never
will
dear
margaret
with
this
knave
saying
poor
old
dad
it
had
gone
to
my
heart
like
a
knife
well
said
my
master
gloomily
have
made
a
bad
bargain
presently
he
halts
and
eyes
a
tree
by
the
wayside
spell
me
what
is
writ
on
yon
tree
so
i
went
and
there
was
nought
but
a
long
square
drawn
in
outline
i
told
him
so
much
for
thy
monkish
lore
quoth
he
a
little
farther
and
he
sent
me
to
read
a
wall
there
was
nought
but
a
circle
scratched
on
the
stone
with
a
point
of
nail
or
knife
and
in
the
circle
two
dots
i
said
so
then
said
he
bec
that
square
was
a
warning
some
good
truand
left
it
that
came
through
this
village
faring
west
that
means
the
circle
with
the
two
dots
was
writ
by
another
of
our
brotherhood
and
it
signifies
as
how
the
writer
soit
rollin
trapu
soit
triboulet
soit
catin
cul
de
bois
or
what
not
was
becked
for
asking
here
and
lay
two
months
in
starabin
then
he
broke
forth
of
your
little
snivelling
books
that
go
in
pouch
three
books
have
i
france
england
and
germany
and
they
are
writ
all
over
in
one
tongue
that
my
brethren
of
all
countries
understand
and
that
is
what
i
call
learning
so
sith
here
they
whip
sores
and
imprison
infirmities
i
to
my
tiring
room
and
he
popped
behind
the
hedge
and
came
back
worshipful
we
passed
through
the
village
and
i
sat
me
down
on
the
stocks
and
even
the
barber
apprentice
whets
his
razor
on
a
block
so
did
i
flesh
my
psaltery
on
this
village
fearing
great
cities
i
tuned
it
and
coursed
up
and
down
the
wires
nimbly
with
my
two
wooden
strikers
and
then
chanted
loud
and
clear
as
i
had
heard
the
minstrels
of
the
country
veut
ouir
qui
veut
savoir
some
trash
i
mind
not
what
and
soon
the
villagers
male
and
female
thronged
about
me
thereat
i
left
singing
and
recited
them
to
the
psaltery
a
short
but
right
merry
tale
out
of
lives
of
the
saints
which
it
is
my
handbook
of
pleasant
figments
and
this
ended
instantly
struck
up
and
whistled
one
of
cul
de
jatte
devil
ditties
and
played
it
on
the
psaltery
to
boot
thou
knowest
heaven
hath
bestowed
on
me
a
rare
whistle
both
for
compass
and
tune
and
with
me
whistling
bright
and
full
this
sprightly
air
and
making
the
wires
slow
when
the
tune
did
gallop
and
tripping
when
the
tune
did
amble
or
i
did
stop
and
shake
on
one
note
like
a
lark
i
the
air
they
were
like
to
eat
me
but
looking
round
lo
my
master
had
given
way
to
his
itch
and
there
was
his
hat
on
the
ground
and
copper
pouring
in
i
deemed
it
cruel
to
whistle
the
bread
out
of
poverty
pouch
so
broke
off
and
away
yet
could
not
get
clear
so
swift
but
both
men
and
women
did
slobber
me
sore
and
smelled
all
of
garlic
master
said
i
call
that
cleaving
the
divell
in
twain
and
keeping
his
white
half
said
he
bec
i
have
made
a
good
bargain
then
he
bade
me
stay
where
i
was
while
he
went
to
the
holy
land
i
stayed
and
he
leaped
the
churchyard
dike
and
the
sexton
was
digging
a
grave
and
my
master
chaffered
with
him
and
came
back
with
a
knuckle
bone
but
why
he
clept
a
churchyard
holy
land
that
i
learned
not
then
but
after
dinner
i
was
colouring
the
armories
of
a
little
inn
and
he
sat
by
me
most
peaceable
a
cutting
and
filing
and
polishing
bones
sedately
so
i
speered
was
not
honest
work
sweet
rain
water
said
he
mocking
was
he
a
making
pair
of
bones
to
play
on
with
thee
and
with
the
refuse
a
anthony
thumb
and
a
martin
little
finger
for
the
devout
the
vagabone
and
now
sweet
margaret
thou
seest
our
manner
of
life
faring
rhineward
i
with
the
two
arts
i
had
least
prized
or
counted
on
for
bread
was
welcome
everywhere
too
poor
now
to
fear
robbers
yet
able
to
keep
both
master
and
man
on
the
road
for
at
night
i
often
made
a
portraiture
of
the
innkeeper
or
his
dame
and
so
went
richer
from
an
inn
the
which
it
is
the
lot
of
few
but
my
master
despised
this
even
way
of
life
love
ups
and
downs
said
he
and
certes
he
lacked
them
not
one
day
he
would
gather
more
than
i
in
three
another
to
hear
his
tale
it
had
rained
kicks
all
day
in
lieu
of
and
that
is
pennies
yet
even
then
at
heart
he
despised
me
for
a
poor
mechanical
soul
and
scorned
my
arts
extolling
his
own
the
art
of
feigning
natheless
at
odd
times
was
he
ill
at
his
ease
going
through
the
town
of
aix
we
came
upon
a
beggar
walking
fast
by
one
hand
to
a
and
the
hangman
a
lashing
his
bare
bloody
back
he
stout
knave
so
whipt
did
not
a
jot
relent
but
i
did
wince
at
every
stroke
and
my
master
hung
his
head
or
late
bon
bec
quoth
he
or
late
i
seeing
his
haggard
face
knew
what
he
meaned
and
at
a
town
whose
name
hath
slipped
me
but
was
on
a
fair
river
as
we
came
to
the
foot
of
the
bridge
he
halted
and
shuddered
what
is
the
coil
said
i
blind
said
he
are
justifying
there
so
nought
would
serve
him
but
take
a
boat
and
cross
the
river
by
water
but
was
out
of
the
as
the
word
goeth
for
the
boatman
had
scarce
told
us
the
matter
and
that
it
was
a
man
and
a
woman
for
stealing
glazed
windows
out
of
housen
and
that
the
man
was
hanged
at
daybreak
and
the
quean
to
be
drowned
when
lo
they
did
fling
her
off
the
bridge
and
fell
in
the
water
not
far
from
us
and
oh
margaret
the
deadly
splash
it
ringeth
in
mine
ears
even
now
but
worse
was
coming
for
though
tied
she
came
up
and
cried
help
and
i
forgetting
all
and
hearing
a
woman
voice
cry
was
for
leaping
in
to
save
her
and
had
surely
done
it
but
the
boatman
and
cul
de
jatte
clung
round
me
and
in
a
moment
the
man
that
waited
in
a
boat
came
and
entangled
his
hooked
pole
in
her
long
hair
and
so
thrust
her
down
and
ended
her
oh
if
the
saints
answered
so
our
cries
for
help
and
poor
cul
de
jatte
groaned
and
i
sat
sobbing
and
beat
my
breast
and
cried
what
hath
god
made
hearts
the
reader
stopped
and
the
tears
trickled
down
her
cheeks
gerard
crying
in
lorraine
made
her
cry
at
rotterdam
the
leagues
were
no
more
to
her
heart
than
the
breadth
of
a
room
eli
softened
by
many
touches
in
the
letter
and
by
the
reader
womanly
graces
said
kindly
enough
take
thy
time
lass
and
methinks
some
of
ye
might
find
her
a
creepie
to
rest
her
foot
and
she
so
near
her
own
i
do
more
for
her
than
that
an
i
durst
said
catherine
here
cornelis
and
she
held
out
her
little
wooden
stool
and
that
worthy
who
hated
margaret
worse
than
ever
had
to
take
the
creepie
and
put
it
carefully
under
her
foot
you
are
very
kind
dame
she
faltered
i
will
read
on
is
all
i
can
do
for
you
in
turn
thus
seeing
my
master
ashy
and
sore
shaken
i
deemed
this
horrible
tragic
act
came
timeously
to
warn
him
so
i
strove
sore
to
turn
him
from
his
ill
ways
discoursing
of
sinners
and
their
lethal
end
late
said
he
late
and
gnashed
his
teeth
then
i
told
him
was
the
divell
favourite
whisper
in
repentant
ears
said
i
lord
is
debonair
let
sinners
nought
despair
late
said
he
and
gnashed
his
teeth
and
writhed
his
face
as
though
vipers
were
biting
his
inward
parts
but
dear
heart
his
was
a
mind
like
running
water
ere
we
cleared
the
town
he
was
carolling
and
outside
the
gate
hung
the
other
culprit
from
the
bough
of
a
little
tree
and
scarce
a
yard
above
the
ground
and
that
stayed
my
music
but
ere
we
had
gone
another
furlong
he
feigned
to
have
dropped
his
rosary
and
ran
back
with
no
good
intent
as
you
shall
hear
i
strolled
on
very
slowly
and
often
halting
and
presently
he
came
stumping
up
on
one
leg
and
that
bandaged
i
asked
him
how
he
could
contrive
that
for
was
masterly
done
that
was
his
mystery
would
i
know
that
i
must
join
the
brotherhood
and
presently
we
did
pass
a
narrow
lane
and
at
the
mouth
o
espied
a
written
stone
telling
beggars
by
a
word
like
a
wee
pitchfork
to
go
that
way
yon
farmhouse
said
he
thou
at
hand
and
he
went
to
the
house
and
came
back
with
money
food
and
wine
lad
did
the
business
said
he
slapping
his
one
leg
proudly
then
he
undid
the
bandage
and
with
prideful
face
showed
me
a
hole
in
his
calf
you
could
have
put
your
neef
in
had
i
been
strange
to
his
tricks
here
was
a
leg
had
drawn
my
last
penny
presently
another
farmhouse
by
the
road
he
made
for
it
i
stood
and
asked
myself
should
i
run
away
and
leave
him
not
to
be
shamed
in
my
own
despite
by
him
but
while
i
doubted
there
was
a
great
noise
and
my
master
well
cudgelled
by
the
farmer
and
his
men
came
towards
me
hobbling
and
holloaing
for
the
peasants
had
laid
on
heartily
but
more
trouble
was
at
his
heels
some
mischievous
wight
loosed
a
dog
as
big
as
a
jackass
colt
and
came
roaring
after
him
and
downed
him
momently
i
deeming
the
poor
rogue
death
certain
and
him
least
fit
to
die
drew
my
sword
and
ran
shouting
but
ere
i
could
come
near
the
muckle
dog
had
torn
away
his
bad
leg
and
ran
growling
to
his
lair
with
it
and
cul
de
jatte
slipped
his
knot
and
came
running
like
a
lapwing
with
his
hair
on
end
and
so
striking
with
both
crutches
before
and
behind
at
unreal
dogs
as
was
like
a
windmill
crazed
he
fled
adown
the
road
i
followed
leisurely
and
found
him
at
dinner
the
quiens
said
he
and
not
a
word
all
dinner
time
but
the
quiens
i
said
i
must
know
who
they
were
before
i
would
curse
them
why
that
was
dogs
and
i
knew
not
even
that
much
he
had
made
a
bad
bargain
well
well
said
he
we
shall
be
in
germany
there
the
folk
are
music
bitten
and
they
molest
not
beggars
unless
they
fake
to
boot
and
then
they
drown
us
out
of
hand
that
moment
curse
we
came
to
strasbourg
and
i
looked
down
rhine
with
longing
heart
the
stream
how
swift
it
seemed
running
to
clip
sevenbergen
to
its
soft
bosom
with
but
a
piece
of
timber
and
an
oar
i
might
drift
at
my
ease
to
thee
sleeping
yet
gliding
still
was
a
sore
temptation
but
the
fear
of
an
ill
welcome
from
my
folk
and
of
the
neighbours
sneers
and
the
hope
of
coming
back
to
thee
victorious
not
as
now
i
must
defeated
and
shamed
and
thee
with
me
it
did
withhold
me
and
so
with
many
sighs
and
often
turning
of
the
head
to
look
on
beloved
rhine
i
turned
sorrowful
face
and
heavy
heart
towards
alas
dame
alas
good
master
eli
forgive
me
but
i
can
win
over
this
part
all
at
one
time
it
taketh
my
breath
away
welladay
why
did
he
not
listen
to
his
heart
had
he
not
gone
through
peril
enow
sorrow
enow
the
letter
dropped
from
her
hand
and
she
drooped
like
a
wounded
lily
then
there
was
a
clatter
on
the
floor
and
it
was
little
kate
going
on
her
crutches
with
flushed
face
and
eyes
full
of
pity
to
console
her
water
mother
she
cried
i
am
afeared
she
shall
nay
nay
fear
me
not
said
margaret
feebly
i
will
not
be
so
troublesome
thy
it
maketh
me
stouter
hearted
sweet
mistress
kate
for
if
thou
carest
how
i
fare
sure
heaven
is
not
against
catherine
d
hear
that
my
man
eli
ay
wife
i
hear
and
mark
to
little
kate
went
back
to
her
place
and
margaret
read
on
the
germans
are
fonder
of
armorials
than
the
french
so
i
found
work
every
day
and
whiles
i
wrought
my
master
would
leave
me
and
doff
his
raiment
and
don
his
rags
and
other
infirmities
and
cozen
the
world
which
he
did
clepe
it
of
the
goose
this
done
would
meet
me
and
demand
half
my
earnings
and
with
restless
piercing
eye
ask
me
would
i
be
so
base
as
cheat
my
poor
master
by
making
three
parts
in
lieu
of
two
till
i
threatened
to
lend
him
a
cuff
to
boot
in
requital
of
his
suspicion
and
thenceforth
took
his
due
with
feigned
confidence
in
my
good
faith
the
which
his
dancing
eye
belied
early
in
germany
we
had
a
quarrel
i
had
seen
him
buy
a
skull
of
a
jailer
wife
and
mighty
zealous
a
polishing
it
thought
i
can
he
carry
yon
memento
and
not
repent
seeing
where
ends
his
way
presently
i
did
catch
him
selling
it
to
a
woman
for
the
head
of
barnabas
with
a
tale
had
cozened
an
ebrew
so
i
snatched
it
out
of
their
hands
and
trundled
it
into
the
ditch
thou
impious
knave
said
i
sell
for
a
saint
the
skull
of
some
dead
thief
thy
brother
he
slunk
away
but
shallow
she
did
crawl
after
the
skull
and
with
apron
reverently
dust
it
for
barnabas
and
it
barabbas
and
so
home
with
it
said
i
vult

but
lo
my
master
fell
on
his
knees
and
begged
me
for
pity
sake

turn
him
off

become
of
him
he
did
so
love
honesty

said
i
said
he

but
to
look
on

so
fair
a
thing
to
look
on
alas

how

so
simple
as
thou

throat

the
money

in
my
belt

walk
at
mine
ease
with
a
sharp
i
dare
not
go
before
in
a
narrow
way
alas
forgive
me
now
i
know
where
in
thy
bonnet
lurks
the
bee
i
will
ware

sting
i
will
but
pluck
the
secular
goose
be
it
said
i
example
was
contagious
he
should
be
a
true
man
by
then
we
reached
nurnberg
was
a
long
way
to
nurnberg
seeing
him
so
humble
i
said
doff
rags
and
make
thyself
decent
help
me
forget
what
thou
art
and
he
did
so
and
we
sat
down
to
our
nonemete
presently
came
by
a
reverend
palmer
with
hat
stuck
round
with
cockle
shells
from
holy
land
and
great
rosary
of
beads
like
eggs
of
teal
and
sandals
for
shoes
and
he
leaned
on
his
long
staff
and
offered
us
a
shell
apiece
my
master
would
none
but
i
to
set
him
a
better
example
took
one
and
for
it
gave
the
poor
pilgrim
two
batzen
and
had
his
blessing
and
he
was
scarce
gone
when
we
heard
savage
cries
and
came
a
sorry
sight
one
leading
a
wild
woman
in
a
chain
all
rags
and
howling
like
a
wolf
and
when
they
came
nigh
us
she
fell
to
tearing
her
rags
to
threads
the
man
sought
an
alms
of
us
and
told
us
his
hard
case
was
his
wife
stark
raving
mad
and
he
could
not
work
in
the
fields
and
leave
her
in
his
house
to
fire
it
nor
cure
her
could
be
without
the
saintys
help
and
had
vowed
six
pounds
of
wax
to
anthony
to
heal
her
and
so
was
fain
beg
of
charitable
folk
for
the
money
and
now
she
espied
us
and
flew
at
me
with
her
long
nails
and
i
was
cold
with
fear
so
devilish
showed
her
face
and
rolling
eyes
and
nails
like
birdys
talons
but
he
with
the
chain
checked
her
sudden
and
with
his
whip
did
cruelly
lash
her
for
it
that
i
cried
forbear
she
knoweth
not
what
she
doth
and
gave
him
a
batz
and
being
gone
said
i
of
those
twain
i
know
not
which
is
the
more
pitiable
and
he
laughed
in
my
face
thy
justice
bon
bec
said
he
railest
on
thy
poor
good
within
an
ace
of
honest
master
and

one
of
us

sham
maniac
and
wow
but
she
did
it
clumsily
i
blushed
for
her
and
thee
also
gavest
two
batzen
for
a
shell
from
holy
land
that
came
no
farther
than

that
coast
by
scores

along
so
motley
a
crew
as
never
your

beheld
dear
margaret
marched
at
their
head
one
with
a
banner
on
a
lance
and
girded
with
a
great
long
sword
and
in
velvet
doublet
and
leathern
jerkin
the
which
stuffs
saw
i
wedded
afore
on
mortal
flesh
and
a
gay
feather
in
his
lordly
cap
and
a
couple
of
dead
fowls
at
his
back
the
which
an
the
spark
had
come
by
honestly
i
am
much
mistook
him
followed
wives
and
babes
on
two
lean
horses
whose
flanks
still
rattled
like
parchment
drum
being
beaten
by
kettles
and
caldrons
next
an
armed
man
of
a
horse
which
drew
a
cart
full
of
females
and
children
and
in
it
sitting
backwards
a
lusty
lazy
knave
lance
in
hand
with
his
luxurious
feet
raised
on
a
holy
that
lay
along
and
therein
a
cat
new
kittened
sat
glowing
her
brood
and
sparks
for
eyes
and
the
cavalier
had
on
his
shoulders
a
round
bundle
and
thereon
did
perch
a
cock
and
crowed
with
zeal
poor
ruffler
proud
of
his
brave
feathers
as
the
rest
and
haply
with
more
reason
being
his
own
and
on
an
ass
another
wife
and
child
and
one
poor
quean
scarce
dragged
herself
along
so
near
her
time
was
she
yet
held
two
little
ones
by
the
hand
and
helplessly
helped
them
on
the
road
and
the
little
folk
were
just
a
farce
some
rode
sticks
with
horses
heads
between
their
legs
which
pranced
and
caracoled
and
soon
wearied
the
riders
so
sore
they
stood
stock
still
and
wept
which
cavaliers
were
presently
taken
into
cart
and
cuffed
and
one
more
grave
lost
in
a
man
hat
and
feather
walked
in
egyptian
darkness
handed
by
a
girl
another
had
the
great
saucepan
on
his
back
and
a
tremendous
sat
on
his
head
and
shoulders
swallowing
him
so
as
he
too
went
darkling
led
by
his
sweetheart
three
foot
high
when
they
were
gone
by
and
we
had
both
laughed
lustily
said
i
master
my
bowels
they
yearn
for
one
of
that
tawdry
band
even
for
the
poor
wife
so
near
the
downlying
scarce
able
to
drag
herself
yet
still
poor
soul
helping
the

on
the

pluck
up

certes
thou
art
no
kate
nay
mother

not

i
trow
but
her
father
and
dear

why
take
notice
to
put
her
to
the
blush
richart
so
i
and
he
derided
me
that
is
a
biltreger
said
he
you
waste
your
bowels
on
a
pillow
or
so
forth
i
told
him
he
lied
would
show
said
he
till
they
camp
and
rising
after
meat
and
meditation
and
travelling
forward
we
found
them
camped
between
two
great
trees
on
a
common
by
the
wayside
and
they
had
lighted
a
great
fire
and
on
it
was
their
caldron
and
one
of
the
trees
slanting
the
fire
a
kid
hung
down
by
a
chain
from
the
to
the
fire
and
in
the
fork
was
wedged
an
urchin
turning
still
the
chain
to
keep
the
meat
from
burning
and
a
gay
spark
with
a
feather
in
his
cap
cut
up
a
sheep
and
another
had
spitted
a
leg
of
it
on
a
wooden
stake
and
a
woman
ended
chanticleer
pride
with
wringing
of
his
neck
and
under
the
other
tree
four
rufflers
played
at
cards
and
quarrelled
and
no
word
sans
oath
and
of
these
lewd
gamblers
one
had
cockles
in
his
hat
and
was
my
reverend
pilgrim
and
a
female
young
and
comely
and
dressed
like
a
butterfly
sat
and
mended
a
heap
of
dirty
rags
and
cul
de
jatte
said
is
the
vopper
and
i
looked
incredulous
and
looked
again
and
it
was
so
and
at
her
feet
sat
he
that
had
so
late
lashed
her
but
i
ween
he
had
wist
where
to
strike
or
woe
betide
him
and
she
did
now
oppress
him
sore
and
made
him
thread
her
very
needle
the
which
he
did
with
all
humility
so
was
their
comedy
turned
seamy
side
without
and
cul
de
jatte
told
me
was
still
so
with
and
their
men
in
camp
they
would
don
their
bravery
though
but
for
an
hour
and
with
their
tinsel
empire
and
the
man
durst
not
the
least
gainsay
the
or
she
would
turn
him
off
at
these
times
as
i
my
master
and
take
another
tyrant
more
submissive
and
my
master
chuckled
over
me
natheless
we
soon
espied
a
wife
set
with
her
back
against
the
tree
and
her
hair
down
and
her
face
white
and
by
her
side
a
wench
held
up
to
her
eye
a
newborn
babe
with
words
of
cheer
and
the
rough
fellow
her
husband
did
bring
her
hot
wine
in
a
cup
and
bade
her
take
courage
and
just
the
place
she
sat
they
had
pinned
from
bough
to
bough
of
those
neighbouring
trees
two
shawls
and
blankets
two
together
to
keep
the
drizzle
off
her
and
so
had
another
poor
little
rogue
come
into
the
world
and
by
her
own
particular
folk
tended
gipsywise
but
of
the
roasters
and
boilers
and
voppers
and
gamblers
no
more
noticed
no
not
for
a
single
moment
than
sheep
which
droppeth
her
lamb
in
a
field
by
travellers
upon
the
way
then
said
i
of
thy
foul
suspicions
master
blinds
the
eye
as
well
as
and
he
laughed
and
said
bon
bec
triumph
the
chances
were
nine
in
ten
against
thee
then
i
did
pity
her
to
be
in
a
crowd
at
such
a
time
but
he
rebuked
me
should
pity
rather
your
queens
and
royal
duchesses
which
by
law
are
condemned
to
groan
in
a
crowd
of
nobles
and
courtiers
and
do
writhe
with
shame
as
well
as
sorrow
being
come
of
decent
mothers
whereas
these
gipsy
women
have
no
more
shame
under
their
skins
than
a
wolf
ruth
or
a
hare
valour
and
bon
bec
quoth
he
espy
in
thee
a
lamentable
fault
wastest
thy
bowels
wilt
have
none
left
for
thy
poor
good
master
which
doeth
thy
will
by
night
and
day
then
we
came
forward
and
he
talked
with
the
men
in
some
strange
hebrew
cant
whereof
no
word
knew
i
and
the
poor
knaves
bade
us
welcome
and
denied
us
nought
with
them
and
all
they
had
was
lightly
come
and
lightly
go
and
when
we
left
them
my
master
said
to
me
is
thy
first
lesson
but
we
shall
lie
at
hansburgh
come
with
me
to
the
rotboss
there
and
i
show
thee
all
our
folk
and
their
lays
and
especially
the
lossners
the
dutzers
the
schleppers
the
gickisses
the
schwanfelders
whom
in
england
we
call
shivering
jemmies
the
suntvegers
the
schwiegers
the
joners
the
sesseldegers
the
gensscherers
in
france
marcandiers
or
rifodes
the
veranerins
the
stabulers
with
a
few
foreigners
like
ourselves
such
as
pietres
francmitoux
polissons
malingreux
traters
rufflers
whipjalks
dommerars
glymmerars
jarkmen
patricos
swadders
autem
morts
walking
morts
cried
i
stopping
him
as
gleesome
as
the
evil
one
a
counting
of
his
imps
i
jot
down
in
my
tablet
all
these
caitiffs
and
their
accursed
names
for
knowledge
is
knowledge
but
go
among
them
alive
or
dead
that
will
i
not
with
my
good
will
moreover
said
i
need
since
i
have
a
companion
in
thee
who
is
all
the
knaves
on
earth
in
one
and
thought
to
abash
him
but
his
face
shone
with
pride
and
hand
on
breast
he
did
bow
low
to
me
thy
wit
be
scant
good
bon
bec
thy
manners
are
a
charm
i
have
made
a
good
bargain
so
he
to
the
and
i
to
a
decent
inn
and
sketched
the
landlord
daughter
by
and
started
at
morn
batzen
three
the
richer
but
could
not
find
my
master
so
loitered
slowly
on
and
presently
met
him
coming
west
for
me
and
cursing
the
quiens
why
so
because
he
could
blind
the
culls
but
not
the
quiens
at
last
i
prevailed
on
him
to
leave
cursing
and
canting
and
tell
me
his
adventure
said
he
sat
outside
the
gate
of
yon
monastery
full
of
sores
which
i
the
oh
bon
bec
beautifuller
sores
you
never
saw
and
it
rained
coppers
in
my
hat
presently
the
monks
came
home
from
some
procession
and
the
convent
dogs
ran
out
to
meet
them
curse
the
quiens
did
they
fall
on
thee
and
bite
thee
poor
soul
worse
dear
bon
bec
had
they
bitten
me
i
had
earned
silver
but
the
great
idiots
being
as
i
think
puppies
or
little
better
fell
on
me
where
i
sat
downed
me
and
fell
a
licking
my
sores
among
them
as
thou
false
knave
didst
swear
the
whelps
in
heaven
licked
the
sores
of
lazybones
a
beggar
of
old
nay
said
i
said
no
such
thing
but
tell
me
since
they
bit
thee
not
but
sportfully
licked
thee
what
harm
harm
noodle
why
the
sores
came
off
could
that
be
could
aught
else
be
and
them
just
fresh
put
on
did
i
think
he
was
so
weak
as
bite
holes
in
his
flesh
with
ratsbane
nay
he
was
an
artist
a
painter
like
his
servant
and
had
put
on
sores
made
of
pig
blood
rye
meal
and
glue
so
when
the
folk
saw
my
sores
go
on
tongues
of
puppies
they
laughed
and
i
saw
cord
or
sack
before
me
so
up
i
jumped
and
shouted
a
miracle
a
miracle
the
very
dogs
of
this
holy
convent
be
holy
and
have
cured
me
good
fathers
cried
i
whose
day
is
this
st
isidore
said
one
st
isidore
cried
i
in
a
sort
of
rapture
why
isidore
is
my
patron
saint
so
that
and
the
simple
folk
swallowed
my
miracle
as
those
accursed
quiens
my
wounds
but
the
monks
took
me
inside
and
shut
the
gate
and
put
their
heads
together
but
i
have
a
quick
ear
and
one
did
say
caret
miraculo
monasterium
which
is
greek
patter
leastways
it
is
no
beggar
cant
finally
they
bade
the
lay
brethren
give
me
a
hiding
and
take
me
out
a
back
way
and
put
me
on
the
road
and
threatened
me
did
i
come
back
to
the
town
to
hand
me
to
the
magistrate
and
have
me
drowned
for
a
plain
impostor
profit
now
by
the
grace
said
they
and
mend
thy
so
forward
bon
bec
for
my
life
is
not
sure
nigh
hand
this
town
as
we
went
he
worked
his
shoulders
but
the
brethren
laid
on
and
what
means
yon
piece
of
monk
cant
i
wonder
so
i
told
him
the
words
meant
monastery
is
in
want
of
a
miracle
but
the
application
thereof
was
dark
to
me
cried
he
as
noon
why
it
means
they
are
going
to
work
the
miracle
my
miracle
and
gather
all
the
grain
i
sowed
therefore
these
blows
on
their
benefactor
shoulders
therefore
is
he
that
wrought
their
scurry
miracle
driven
forth
with
stripes
and
threats
oh
cozening
knaves
said
i
you
to
complain
of
guile
bon
bec
said
he
but
outwit
the
simple
but
these
monks
would
pluck
lucifer
of
his
wing
feathers
and
went
a
league
bemoaning
himself
that
he
was
not
like
his
servant
would
put
it
to
more
profit
and
railing
on
quiens
as
for
those
monks
there
was
one
above
said
i
is
one
above
what
then
will
call
those
shavelings
to
compt
one
day
quoth
he
all
deceitful
men
said
i
at
one
that
afternoon
i
got
armories
to
paint
so
my
master
took
the
yellow
jaundice
and
went
begging
through
the
town
and
with
his
oily
tongue
and
face
did
fill
his
hat
now
in
all
the
towns
are
certain
licensed
beggars
and
one
of
these
was
an
old
favourite
with
the
townsfolk
had
his
station
at
martin
porch
the
greatest
church
a
blind
man
they
called
him
blind
hans
he
saw
my
master
drawing
coppers
on
the
other
side
the
street
and
knew
him
by
his
tricks
for
an
impostor
so
sent
and
warned
the
constables
and
i
met
my
master
in
the
constables
hands
and
going
to
his
trial
in
the
town
hall
i
followed
and
many
more
and
he
was
none
abashed
neither
by
the
pomp
of
justice
nor
memory
of
his
misdeeds
but
demanded
his
accuser
like
a
trumpet
and
blind
hans
boy
came
forward
but
was
sifted
narrowly
by
my
master
and
stammered
and
faltered
and
owned
he
had
seen
nothing
but
only
carried
blind
hans
tale
to
the
chief
constable
is
but
hearsay
said
my
master
ye
now
here
standeth
misfortune
backbit
by
envy
but
stand
thou
forth
blind
envy
and
vent
thine
own
lie
and
blind
hans
behoved
to
stand
forth
sore
against
his
will
him
did
my
master
so
press
with
questions
and
so
pinch
and
torture
asking
him
again
and
again
how
being
blind
he
could
see
all
that
befell
and
some
that
befell
not
across
a
way
and
why
an
he
could
not
see
he
came
there
holding
up
his
perjured
hand
and
maligning
the
misfortunate
that
at
last
he
groaned
aloud
and
would
utter
no
word
more
and
an
alderman
said
sooth
hans
ye
are
to
blame
hast
cast
more
dirt
of
suspicion
on
thyself
than
on
him
but
the
burgomaster
a
wondrous
fat
man
and
methinks
of
his
fat
some
had
gotten
into
his
head
checked
him
and
said
hans
we
know
this
many
years
and
be
he
blind
or
not
he
hath
passed
for
blind
so
long
is
all
one
back
to
thy
porch
good
hans
and
let
the
strange
varlet
leave
the
town
incontinent
on
pain
of
whipping
then
my
master
winked
to
me
but
there
rose
a
civic
officer
in
his
gown
of
state
and
golden
chain
a
dignity
with
us
lightly
prized
and
even
shunned
of
some
but
in
germany
and
france
much
courted
save
by
condemned
malefactors
to
wit
the
hangman
and
says
he
please
you
first
let
us
see
why
he
weareth
his
hair
so
thick
and
low
and
his
man
went
and
lifted
cul
de
jatte
hair
and
lo
the
upper
gristle
of
both
ears
was
gone
is
this
knave
quoth
the
burgomaster
my
master
said
carelessly
he
minded
not
precisely
his
had
been
a
life
of
misfortunes
and
losses
when
a
poor
soul
has
lost
the
use
of
his
leg
noble
sirs
these
more
trivial
woes
rest
lightly
in
his
memory
when
he
found
this
would
not
serve
his
turn
he
named
two
famous
battles
in
each
of
which
he
had
lost
half
an
ear
a
fighting
like
a
true
man
against
traitors
and
rebels
but
the
hangman
showed
them
the
two
cuts
were
made
at
one
time
and
by
measurement
no
bungling
work
my
masters
said
he
ourn
then
the
burgomaster
gave
judgment
present
charge
is
not
proven
against
thee
but
an
thou
beest
not
guilty
now
thou
hast
been
at
other
times
witness
thine
ears
wherefore
i
send
thee
to
prison
for
one
month
and
to
give
a
florin
towards
the
new
hall
of
the
guilds
now
a
building
and
to
be
whipt
out
of
the
town
and
pay
the
hangman
fee
for
the
same
and
all
the
aldermen
approved
and
my
master
was
haled
to
prison
with
one
look
of
anguish
it
did
strike
my
bosom
i
tried
to
get
speech
of
him
but
the
jailer
denied
me
but
lingering
near
the
jail
i
heard
a
whistle
and
there
was
cul
de
jatte
at
a
narrow
window
twenty
feet
from
earth
i
went
under
and
he
asked
me
what
made
i
there
i
told
him
i
was
loath
to
go
forward
and
not
bid
him
farewell
he
seemed
quite
amazed
but
soon
his
suspicious
soul
got
the
better
that
was
not
all
mine
errand
i
told
him
not
all
the
psaltery
what
of
that
was
not
mine
but
his
i
would
pay
him
the
price
of
it
throw
me
a
rix
dollar
said
he
i
counted
out
my
coins
and
they
came
to
a
rix
dollar
and
two
batzen
i
threw
him
up
his
money
in
three
throws
and
when
he
had
got
it
all
he
said
softly
bec
said
i
then
the
poor
rogue
was
greatly
moved
thought
ye
had
been
mocking
me
said
he
bon
bec
bon
bec
if
i
had
found
the
world
like
thee
at
starting
i
had
put
my
wit
to
better
use
and
i
had
not
lain
here
then
he
whimpered
out
gave
not
quite
a
rix
dollar
for
the
jingler
and
threw
me
back
that
he
had
gone
to
cheat
me
of
honest
for
once
and
over
late
and
so
with
many
sighs
bade
me
godspeed
thus
did
my
master
after
often
baffling
men
justice
fall
by
their
injustice
for
his
lost
ears
proved
not
his
guilt
only
but
of
that
guilt
the
bitter
punishment
so
the
account
was
even
yet
they
for
his
chastisement
did
chastise
him
natheless
he
was
a
parlous
rogue
yet
he
holp
to
make
a
man
of
me
thanks
to
his
good
wit
i
went
forward
richer
far
with
my
psaltery
and
brush
than
with
yon
as
good
as
stolen
purse
for
that
must
have
run
dry
in
time
like
a
big
trough
but
these
a
little
richart
how
pregnant
his
reflections
be
and
but
a
curly
pated
lad
when
last
i
saw
him
asking
your
pardon
mistress
prithee
read
one
day
i
walked
alone
and
sooth
to
say
lighthearted
for
mine
honest
denys
sweetened
the
air
on
the
way
but
poor
cul
de
jatte
poisoned
it
the
next
day
passing
a
grand
house
out
came
on
prancing
steeds
a
gentleman
in
brave
attire
and
two
servants
they
overtook
me
the
gentleman
bade
me
halt
i
laughed
in
my
sleeve
for
a
few
batzen
were
all
my
store
he
bade
me
doff
my
doublet
and
jerkin
then
i
chuckled
no
more
you
my
lord
said
i
winter
how
may
a
poor
fellow
go
bare
and
live
so
he
told
me
i
shot
mine
arrow
wide
of
his
thought
and
off
with
his
own
gay
jerkin
richly
furred
and
doublet
to
match
and
held
them
forth
to
me
then
a
servant
let
me
know
it
was
a
penance
lordship
had
had
the
ill
luck
to
slay
his
cousin
in
their
cups
down
to
my
shoes
he
changed
with
me
and
set
me
on
his
horse
like
a
popinjay
and
fared
by
my
side
in
my
worn
weeds
with
my
psaltery
on
his
back
and
said
he
good
youth
thou
art
cousin
detstein
and
i
late
count
thy
servant
play
the
part
well
and
help
me
save
my
bloodstained
soul
be
haughty
and
choleric
as
any
noble
and
i
will
be
as
humble
as
i
may
i
said
i
would
do
my
best
to
play
the
noble
but
what
should
i
call
him
he
bade
me
call
him
nought
but
servant
that
would
mortify
him
most
he
wist
we
rode
on
a
long
way
in
silence
for
i
was
meditating
this
strange
chance
that
from
a
beggar
servant
had
made
me
master
to
a
count
and
also
cudgelling
my
brains
how
best
i
might
play
the
master
without
being
run
through
the
body
all
at
one
time
like
his
cousin
for
i
mistrusted
sore
my
spark
humility
your
german
nobles
being
to
my
knowledge
proud
as
lucifer
and
choleric
as
fire
as
for
the
servants
they
did
slily
grin
to
one
another
to
see
their
master
so
what
is
that
a
lump
as
of
lead
had
just
bounced
against
the
door
and
the
latch
was
fumbled
with
unsuccessfully
another
bounce
and
the
door
swung
inwards
with
giles
arrayed
in
cloth
of
gold
sticking
to
it
like
a
wasp
he
landed
on
the
floor
and
was
embraced
but
on
learning
what
was
going
on
trumpeted
that
he
would
much
liever
hear
of
gerard
than
gossip
sybrandt
pointed
to
a
diminutive
chair
giles
showed
his
sense
of
this
civility
by
tearing
the
said
sybrandt
out
of
a
very
big
one
and
there
ensconced
himself
gorgeous
and
glowing
sybrandt
had
to
wedge
himself
into
the
one
which
was
too
small
for
the
magnificent
dwarf
soul
and
margaret
resumed
but
as
this
part
of
the
letter
was
occupied
with
notices
of
places
all
which
my
reader
probably
knows
and
if
not
can
find
handled
at
large
in
a
dozen
books
from
munster
to
murray
i
skip
the
topography
and
hasten
to
that
part
where
it
occurred
to
him
to
throw
his
letter
into
a
journal
the
personal
narrative
that
intervened
may
be
thus
condensed
he
spoke
but
little
at
first
to
his
new
companions
but
listened
to
pick
up
their
characters
neither
his
noble
servant
nor
his
servants
could
read
or
write
and
as
he
often
made
entries
in
his
tablets
he
impressed
them
with
some
awe
one
of
his
entries
was
le
peu
que
sont
les
for
he
found
the
surly
innkeepers
licked
the
very
ground
before
him
now
nor
did
a
soul
suspect
the
hosier
son
in
the
feathers
nor
the
count
in
the
minstrel
weeds
this
seems
to
have
surprised
him
for
he
enlarged
on
it
with
the
naivete
and
pomposity
of
youth
at
one
place
being
humbly
requested
to
present
the
inn
with
his
armorial
bearings
he
consented
loftily
but
painted
them
himself
to
mine
host
wonder
who
thought
he
lowered
himself
by
handling
brush
the
true
count
stood
grinning
by
and
held
the
while
the
sham
count
painted
the
shield
with
three
red
herrings
rampant
under
a
sort
of
maltese
cross
made
with
two
at
first
his
plebeian
servants
were
insolent
but
this
coming
to
the
notice
of
his
noble
one
he
forgot
what
he
was
doing
penance
for
and
drew
his
sword
to
cut
off
their
ears
heads
included
but
gerard
interposed
and
saved
them
and
rebuked
the
count
severely
and
finally
they
all
understood
one
another
and
the
superior
mind
obtained
its
natural
influence
he
played
the
barbarous
noble
of
that
day
vilely
for
his
heart
would
not
let
him
be
either
tyrannical
or
cold
here
were
three
human
beings
he
tried
to
make
them
all
happier
than
he
was
held
them
ravished
with
stories
and
songs
and
set
herr
penitent
and
dancing
with
his
whistle
and
psaltery
for
his
own
convenience
he
made
them
ride
and
tie
and
thus
pushed
rapidly
through
the
country
travelling
generally
fifteen
leagues
a
day
diary
this
first
day
of
january
i
observed
a
young
man
of
the
country
to
meet
a
strange
maiden
and
kissed
his
hand
and
then
held
it
out
to
her
she
took
it
with
a
smile
and
lo
acquaintance
made
and
babbled
like
old
friends
greeting
so
pretty
and
delicate
i
did
see
yet
were
they
both
of
the
baser
sort
so
the
next
lass
i
saw
a
coming
i
said
to
my
servant
lord
further
penance
bow
thy
pride
go
meet
yon
girl
kiss
thy
homicidal
hand
and
give
it
her
and
hold
her
in
discourse
as
best
ye
may
and
my
noble
servant
said
humbly
shall
obey
my
lord
and
we
drew
rein
and
watched
while
he
went
forward
kissed
his
hand
and
held
it
out
to
her
forthwith
she
took
it
smiling
and
was
most
affable
with
him
and
he
with
her
presently
came
up
a
band
of
her
companions
so
this
time
i
bade
him
doff
his
bonnet
to
them
as
though
they
were
empresses
and
he
did
so
and
lo
the
lasses
drew
up
as
stiff
as
hedgestakes
and
moved
not
nor
denys
aie
aie
aie
pardon
the
this
surprised
me
none
for
so
they
did
discountenance
poor
denys
and
that
whole
day
i
wore
in
experimenting
these
german
lasses
and
was
still
the
same
an
ye
doff
bonnet
to
them
they
stiffen
into
statues
distance
for
distance
but
accost
them
with
honest
freedom
and
with
that
customary
and
though
rustical
most
gracious
proffer
of
the
kissed
hand
and
they
withhold
neither
their
hands
in
turn
nor
their
acquaintance
in
an
honest
way
seeing
which
i
vexed
myself
that
denys
was
not
with
us
to
prattle
with
them
he
is
so
fond
of
are
you
fond
of
women
denys
and
the
reader
opened
two
great
violet
eyes
upon
him
with
gentle
surprise
denys
ahem
he
says
so
by
hannibal
helmet
is
their
fault
not
mine
they
will
have
such
soft
voices
and
white
skins
and
sunny
hair
and
dark
blue
eyes
and
margaret
reading
suddenly
which
their
affability
i
put
to
profit
thus
i
asked
them
how
they
made
shift
to
grow
roses
in
yule
for
know
dear
margaret
that
throughout
germany
the
baser
sort
of
lasses
wear
for
nought
but
a
or
wreath
of
roses
encircling
their
bare
hair
as
laurel
caesar
and
though
of
the
worshipful
scorned
yet
is
braver
i
wist
to
your
eye
and
mine
which
painters
be
though
sorry
ones
than
the
gorgeous
uncouth
mechanical
of
the
time
and
adorns
not
hides
her
hair
that
goodly
ornament
fitted
to
her
head
by
craft
divine
so
the
good
lasses
being
questioned
close
did
let
me
know
the
rosebuds
are
cut
in
summer
and
laid
then
in
great
thus
ordered
first
bay
salt
then
a
row
of
buds
and
over
that
row
bay
salt
sprinkled
then
another
row
of
buds
placed
crosswise
for
they
say
it
is
death
to
the
buds
to
touch
one
another
and
so
on
buds
and
salt
in
layers
then
each
pot
is
covered
and
soldered
tight
and
kept
in
cool
cellar
and
on
saturday
night
the
master
of
the
house
or
mistress
if
master
be
none
opens
a
pot
and
doles
the
rosebuds
out
to
every
female
in
the
house
high
or
low
withouten
grudge
then
solders
it
up
again
and
such
as
of
these
buds
would
roses
make
put
them
in
warm
water
a
little
space
or
else
in
the
stove
and
then
with
tiny
brush
and
soft
wetted
in
rhenish
wine
do
coax
them
till
they
ope
their
folds
and
some
perfume
them
with
for
alack
their
smell
it
is
fled
with
the
summer
and
only
their
fair
bodyes
lie
withouten
soul
in
tomb
of
clay
awaiting
resurrection
and
some
with
the
roses
and
buds
mix
nutmegs
gilded
but
not
by
my
good
will
for
gold
brave
in
itself
cheek
by
jowl
with
roses
is
but
yellow
earth
and
it
does
the
eye
heart
good
to
see
these
fair
heads
of
hair
come
blooming
with
roses
over
snowy
roads
and
by
hedges
setting
winter
beauty
by
the
side
of
summer
glory
for
what
so
fair
as
winter
lilies
snow
yclept
and
what
so
brave
as
roses
and
shouldst
have
had
a
picture
here
but
for
their
superstition
leaned
a
lass
in
sunday
garb
cross
ankled
against
her
cottage
corner
whose
low
roof
was
and
with
her
crantz
did
seem
a
summer
flower
sprouting
from
winter
bosom
i
drew
rein
and
out
pencil
and
brush
to
limn
her
for
thee
but
the
simpleton
fearing
the
evil
eye
or
glamour
claps
both
hands
to
her
face
and
flies
but
indeed
they
are
not
more
superstitious
than
the
sevenbergen
folk
which
take
thy
father
for
a
magician
yet
softly
sith
at
this
moment
i
profit
by
this
darkness
of
their
minds
for
at
first
sitting
down
to
write
this
diary
i
could
frame
nor
thought
nor
word
so
harried
and
deaved
was
i
with
noise
of
mechanical
persons
and
hoarse
laughter
at
dull
jests
of
one
of
these
particoloured
which
are
so
rife
in
germany
but
oh
sorry
wit
that
is
driven
to
the
poor
resource
of
pointed
and
a
green
and
yellow
body
true
wit
methinks
is
of
the
mind
we
met
in
burgundy
an
honest
wench
though
over
free
for
my
palate
a
chambermaid
had
made
havoc
of
all
these
zanies
droll
by
brute
force
oh
digressor
well
then
i
to
be
rid
of
roaring
rusticalls
and
mindless
jests
put
my
finger
in
a
glass
and
drew
on
the
table
a
great
watery
circle
whereat
the
rusticalls
did
look
askant
like
venison
at
a
cat
and
in
that
circle
a
smaller
circle
the
rusticalls
held
their
peace
and
besides
these
circles
cabalistical
i
laid
down
on
the
table
solemnly
yon
parchment
deed
i
had
out
of
your
house
the
rusticalls
held
their
breath
then
did
i
look
as
glum
as
might
be
and
muttered
slowly
thus
quam
diu
tu
fictus
morio
vosque
veri
stulti
audebitis
in
hac
aula
morari
strepitantes
ita
et
olentes
ut
dulcissimae
nequeam
miser
scribere
they
shook
like
aspens
and
stole
away
on
tiptoe
one
by
one
at
first
then
in
a
rush
and
jostling
and
left
me
alone
and
most
scared
of
all
was
the
fool
never
earned
jester
fairer
his
ass
ears
so
rubbed
i
their
foible
who
first
rubbed
mine
for
of
all
a
traveller
foes
i
dread
those
giants
twain
sir
noise
and
eke
sir
stench
the
saints
and
martyrs
forgive
my
peevishness
thus
i
write
to
thee
in
balmy
peace
and
tell
thee
trivial
things
scarce
worthy
ink
also
how
i
love
thee
which
there
was
no
need
to
tell
for
well
thou
knowest
it
and
oh
dear
margaret
looking
on
their
roses
which
grew
in
summer
but
blow
in
winter
i
see
the
picture
of
our
true
affection
born
it
was
in
smiles
and
bliss
but
soon
adversity
beset
us
sore
with
many
a
bitter
blast
yet
our
love
hath
lost
no
leaf
thank
god
but
blossoms
full
and
fair
as
ever
proof
against
frowns
and
jibes
and
prison
and
banishment
as
those
sweet
german
flowers
a
blooming
in
winter
snow
january
my
servant
the
count
finding
me
curious
took
me
to
the
stables
of
the
prince
that
rules
this
part
in
the
first
court
was
a
adorned
with
pillars
graven
with
the
arms
and
also
the
shop
so
furnished
as
a
rich
apothecary
might
envy
the
stable
is
a
fair
quadrangle
whereof
three
sides
filled
with
horses
of
all
nations
before
each
horse
nose
was
a
glazed
window
with
a
green
curtain
to
be
drawn
at
pleasure
and
at
his
tail
a
thick
wooden
pillar
with
a
brazen
shield
whence
by
turning
of
a
pipe
he
is
watered
and
serves
too
for
a
cupboard
to
keep
his
comb
and
rubbing
clothes
each
rack
was
iron
and
each
manger
shining
copper
and
each
nag
covered
with
a
scarlet
mantle
and
above
him
his
bridle
and
saddle
hung
ready
to
gallop
forth
in
a
minute
and
not
less
than
two
hundred
horses
whereof
twelve
score
of
foreign
breed
and
we
returned
to
our
inn
full
of
admiration
and
the
two
varlets
said
sorrowfully
were
we
born
with
two
legs
and
one
of
the
grooms
that
was
civil
and
had
of
me
trinkgeld
stood
now
at
his
and
asked
us
in
there
we
found
his
wife
and
children
of
all
ages
from
five
to
eighteen
and
had
but
one
room
to
bide
and
sleep
in
a
thing
pestiferous
and
most
uncivil
then
i
asked
my
servant
knew
he
this
prince
ay
did
he
and
had
often
drunk
with
him
in
a
marble
chamber
above
the
stable
where
for
table
was
a
curious
and
artificial
rock
and
the
drinking
vessels
hang
on
its
pinnacles
and
at
the
hottest
of
the
engagement
a
statue
of
a
horseman
in
bronze
came
forth
bearing
a
bowl
of
liquor
and
he
that
sat
nearest
behoved
to
drain
it
well
said
i
for
thy
penance
whisper
thou
in
yon
prince
ear
that
god
hath
given
him
his
people
freely
and
not
sought
a
price
for
them
as
for
horses
and
pray
him
look
inside
the
huts
at
his
door
and
bethink
himself
is
it
well
to
house
his
horses
and
stable
his
folk
said
he
give
sore
offence
said
i
must
do
it
discreetly
and
choose
your
time
so
he
promised
and
riding
on
we
heard
plaintive
cries
said
i
sore
mischance
hath
befallen
some
poor
soul
what
may
it
be
and
we
rode
up
and
lo
it
was
a
wedding
feast
and
the
guests
were
plying
the
business
of
drinking
sad
and
silent
but
ever
and
anon
cried
loud
and
dolefully
frolich
be
merry
january
yesterday
between
nurnberg
and
augsburg
we
parted
company
i
gave
my
lord
late
servant
back
his
brave
clothes
for
mine
but
his
horse
he
made
me
keep
and
five
gold
pieces
and
said
he
was
still
my
debtor
his
penance
it
had
been
slight
along
of
me
but
profitable
but
his
best
word
was
this
see
is
more
noble
to
be
loved
than
feared
and
then
he
did
so
praise
me
as
i
blushed
to
put
on
paper
yet
poor
fool
would
fain
thou
couldst
hear
his
words
but
from
some
other
pen
than
mine
and
the
servants
did
heartily
grasp
my
hand
and
wish
me
good
luck
and
riding
apace
yet
could
i
not
reach
augsburg
till
the
gates
were
closed
but
it
mattered
little
for
this
augsburg
it
is
an
enchanted
city
for
a
small
coin
one
took
me
a
long
way
round
to
a
famous
postern
called
der
einlasse
here
stood
two
guardians
like
statues
to
them
i
gave
my
name
and
business
they
nodded
me
leave
to
knock
i
knocked
and
the
iron
gate
opened
with
a
great
noise
and
hollow
rattling
of
a
chain
but
no
hand
seen
nor
chain
and
he
who
drew
the
hidden
chain
sits
a
butt
length
from
the
gate
and
i
rode
in
and
the
gate
closed
with
a
clang
after
me
i
found
myself
in
a
great
building
with
a
bridge
at
my
feet
this
i
rode
over
and
presently
came
to
a
porter
lodge
where
one
asked
me
again
my
name
and
business
then
rang
a
bell
and
a
great
portcullis
that
barred
the
way
began
to
rise
drawn
by
a
wheel
overhead
and
no
hand
seen
behind
the
portcullis
was
a
thick
oaken
door
studded
with
steel
it
opened
without
hand
and
i
rode
into
a
hall
as
dark
as
pitch
trembling
there
a
while
a
door
opened
and
showed
me
a
smaller
hall
lighted
i
rode
into
it
a
tin
goblet
came
down
from
the
ceiling
by
a
little
chain
i
put
two
batzen
into
it
and
it
went
up
again
being
gone
another
thick
door
creaked
and
opened
and
i
rid
through
it
closed
on
me
with
a
tremendous
clang
and
behold
me
in
augsburg
city
i
lay
at
an
inn
called
three
moors
over
an
hundred
years
old
and
this
morning
according
to
my
way
of
viewing
towns
to
learn
their
compass
and
shape
i
mounted
the
highest
tower
i
could
find
and
setting
my
dial
at
my
foot
surveyed
the
beautiful
city
whole
streets
of
palaces
and
churches
tiled
with
copper
burnished
like
gold
and
the
house
fronts
gaily
painted
and
all
glazed
and
the
glass
so
clean
and
burnished
as
is
most
resplendent
and
rare
and
i
now
first
seeing
a
great
city
did
crow
with
delight
and
like
cock
on
his
ladder
and
at
the
tower
foot
was
taken
into
custody
for
a
spy
for
whilst
i
watched
the
city
the
watchman
had
watched
me
the
burgomaster
received
me
courteously
and
heard
my
story
then
rebuked
he
the
officers
ye
not
question
him
yourselves
or
read
in
his
face
this
is
to
make
our
city
stink
in
strangers
report
then
he
told
me
my
curiosity
was
of
a
commendable
sort
and
seeing
i
was
a
craftsman
and
inquisitive
bade
his
clerk
take
me
among
the
guilds
god
bless
the
city
where
the
very
burgomaster
is
cut
of
soloman
cloth
january
dear
margaret
it
is
a
noble
city
and
a
kind
mother
to
arts
here
they
cut
in
wood
and
ivory
that
is
like
spider
work
and
paint
on
glass
and
sing
angelical
harmonies
writing
of
books
is
quite
gone
by
here
be
six
printers
yet
was
i
offered
a
bountiful
wage
to
write
fairly
a
merchant
accounts
one
fugger
a
grand
and
wealthy
trader
and
hath
store
of
ships
yet
his
father
was
but
a
poor
weaver
but
here
in
commerce
her
very
garden
men
swell
like
mushrooms
and
he
bought
my
horse
of
me
and
abated
me
not
a
jot
which
way
of
dealing
is
not
known
in
holland
but
oh
margaret
the
workmen
of
all
the
guilds
are
so
kind
and
brotherly
to
one
another
and
to
me
here
methinks
i
have
found
the
true
german
mind
loyal
frank
and
kindly
somewhat
choleric
withal
but
nought
revengeful
each
mechanic
wears
a
sword
the
very
weavers
at
the
loom
sit
girded
with
their
weapons
and
all
germans
on
too
slight
occasion
draw
them
and
fight
but
no
treachery
challenge
first
then
draw
and
with
the
edge
only
mostly
the
face
not
with
sir
point
for
if
in
these
combats
one
thrust
at
his
adversary
and
hurt
him
called
ein
schelemstucke
a
heinous
act
both
men
and
women
turn
their
backs
on
him
and
even
the
judges
punish
thrusts
bitterly
but
pass
over
cuts
hence
in
germany
be
good
store
of
scarred
faces
three
in
five
at
least
and
in
france
scarce
more
than
one
in
three
but
in
arts
mechanical
no
citizens
may
compare
with
these
fountains
in
every
street
that
play
to
heaven
and
in
the
gardens
seeming
trees
which
being
approached
one
standing
afar
touches
a
spring
and
every
twig
shoots
water
and
souses
the
guests
to
their
host
much
delectation
big
culverins
of
war
they
cast
with
no
more
ado
than
our
folk
and
have
done
this
fourscore
years
all
stuffs
they
weave
and
linen
fine
as
ours
at
home
or
nearly
which
elsewhere
in
europe
vainly
shall
ye
seek
sir
printing
press
sore
foe
to
poor
gerard
but
to
other
humans
beneficial
plieth
by
night
and
day
and
casteth
goodly
words
like
sower
afield
while
i
poor
fool
can
but
sow
them
as
i
saw
women
in
france
sow
rye
dribbling
it
in
the
furrow
grain
by
grain
and
of
their
strange
mechanical
skill
take
two
examples
for
ending
of
exemplary
rogues
they
have
a
figure
like
a
woman
seven
feet
high
and
called
jung
frau
but
lo
a
spring
is
touched
she
seizeth
the
poor
wretch
with
iron
arms
and
opening
herself
hales
him
inside
her
and
there
pierces
him
through
and
through
with
two
score
lances
secondly
in
all
great
houses
the
spit
is
turned
not
by
a
scrubby
boy
but
by
smoke
ay
mayst
well
admire
and
judge
me
a
lying
knave
these
cunning
germans
do
set
in
the
chimney
a
little
windmill
and
the
smoke
struggling
to
wend
past
turns
it
and
from
the
mill
a
wire
runs
through
the
wall
and
turns
the
spit
on
wheels
beholding
which
i
doffed
my
bonnet
to
the
men
of
augsburg
for
who
but
these
had
ere
devised
to
bind
ye
so
dark
and
subtle
a
knave
as
sir
smoke
and
set
him
to
roast
dame
pullet
this
day
january
with
three
craftsmen
of
the
town
i
painted
a
pack
of
cards
they
were
for
a
senator
in
a
hurry
i
the
diamonds
my
queen
came
forth
with
eyes
like
spring
violets
hair
a
golden
brown
and
witching
smile
my
saw
her
and
put
their
arms
round
my
neck
and
hailed
me
master
oh
noble
germans
no
jealousy
of
a
no
sour
looks
at
a
stranger
and
would
have
me
spend
sunday
with
them
after
matins
and
the
merchant
paid
me
so
richly
as
i
was
ashamed
to
take
the
guerdon
and
i
to
my
inn
and
tried
to
paint
the
queen
of
diamonds
for
poor
gerard
but
no
she
would
not
come
like
again
luck
will
not
be
bespoke
oh
happy
rich
man
that
hath
got
her
fie
fie
happy
gerard
that
shall
have
herself
one
day
and
keep
house
with
her
at
augsburg
january
with
my
fellows
and
one
veit
stoss
a
and
one
hafnagel
of
the
goldsmiths
guild
and
their
wives
and
lasses
to
hafnagel
cousin
a
senator
of
this
free
city
and
his
stupendous
it
is
ribbed
like
a
ship
and
hath
been
eighteen
months
in
hand
and
finished
but
now
and
holds
a
hundred
and
fifty
hogsheads
and
standeth
not
but
lieth
yet
even
so
ye
get
not
on
his
back
withouten
ladders
two
of
thirty
steps
and
we
sat
about
the
miraculous
mass
and
drank
rhenish
from
it
drawn
by
a
little
artificial
pump
and
the
lasses
pinned
their
crantzes
to
it
and
we
danced
round
it
and
the
senator
danced
on
its
back
but
with
drinking
of
so
many
garausses
lost
his
footing
and
fell
off
glass
in
hand
and
broke
an
arm
and
a
leg
in
the
midst
of
us
so
scurvily
ended
our
drinking
bout
for
this
time
january
this
day
started
for
venice
with
a
company
of
merchants
and
among
them
him
who
had
desired
me
for
his
scrivener
and
so
we
are
now
agreed
i
to
write
at
night
the
letters
he
shall
dict
and
other
matters
he
to
feed
and
lodge
me
on
the
road
we
be
many
and
armed
and
soldiers
with
us
to
boot
so
fear
not
the
thieves
which
men
say
lie
on
the
borders
of
italy
but
an
if
i
find
the
printing
press
at
venice
i
trow
i
shall
not
go
unto
rome
for
man
may
not
vie
with
iron
imprimit
una
dies
quantum
non
scribitur
anno
and
dearest
something
tells
me
you
and
i
shall
end
our
days
at
augsburg
whence
going
i
shall
leave
it
all
i
can
my
blessing
january
my
master
affecteth
me
much
and
now
maketh
me
sit
with
him
in
his
a
grave
good
man
of
all
respected
but
sad
for
loss
of
a
dear
daughter
and
loveth
my
psaltery
not
ditties
but
holy
harmonies
such
as
cul
de
jatte
made
wry
mouths
at
so
many
men
so
many
minds
but
cooped
in
and
at
night
writing
his
letters
my
journal
halteth
january
when
not
attending
on
my
good
merchant
i
consort
with
such
of
our
company
as
are
italians
for
is
to
italy
i
wend
and
i
am
ill
seen
in
italian
tongue
a
courteous
and
a
subtle
people
at
meat
delicate
feeders
and
cleanly
love
not
to
put
their
left
hand
in
the
dish
they
say
venice
is
the
garden
of
lombardy
lombardy
the
garden
of
italy
italy
of
the
world
january
ways
and
steep
and
the
mountain
girls
so
girded
up
as
from
their
armpits
to
their
waist
is
but
a
handful
of
all
the
garbs
i
yet
have
seen
the
most
unlovely
january
the
midst
of
life
we
are
in
death
oh
dear
margaret
i
thought
i
had
lost
thee
here
i
lie
in
pain
and
dole
and
shall
write
thee
that
which
read
you
it
in
a
romance
ye
should
cry
improbable
and
so
still
wondering
that
i
am
alive
to
write
it
and
thanking
for
it
god
and
the
saints
this
is
what
befell
thy
gerard
yestreen
i
wearied
of
being
shut
up
in
litter
and
of
the
mule
slow
pace
and
so
went
forward
and
being
i
know
not
why
strangely
full
of
spirit
and
hope
as
i
have
heard
befall
some
men
when
on
brink
seemed
to
tread
on
air
and
soon
distanced
them
all
presently
i
came
to
two
roads
and
took
the
larger
i
should
have
taken
the
smaller
after
travelling
a
good
i
found
my
error
and
returned
and
deeming
my
company
had
long
passed
by
pushed
bravely
on
but
i
could
not
overtake
them
and
small
wonder
as
you
shall
hear
then
i
was
anxious
and
ran
but
bare
was
the
road
of
those
i
sought
and
night
came
down
and
the
wild
beasts
and
i
bemoaned
my
folly
also
i
was
hungered
the
moon
rose
clear
and
bright
exceedingly
and
presently
a
little
way
off
the
road
i
saw
a
tall
windmill
said
i
the
miller
will
take
ruth
on
me
near
the
mill
was
a
haystack
and
scattered
about
were
store
of
little
barrels
but
lo
they
were
not
but
one
or
two
and
the
rest
of
spirits
brant
vein
and
schiedam
i
knew
them
momently
having
seen
the
like
in
holland
i
knocked
at
the
but
none
answered
i
lifted
the
latch
and
the
door
opened
inwards
i
went
in
and
gladly
for
the
night
was
fine
but
cold
and
a
rime
on
the
trees
which
were
a
kind
of
lofty
sycamores
there
was
a
stove
but
black
i
lighted
it
with
some
of
the
hay
and
wood
for
there
was
a
great
pile
of
wood
outside
and
i
know
not
how
i
went
to
sleep
not
long
had
i
slept
i
trow
when
hearing
a
noise
i
awoke
and
there
were
a
dozen
men
around
me
with
wild
faces
and
long
black
hair
and
black
sparkling
catherine
oh
my
poor
boy
those
ones
do
still
scare
me
to
look
i
made
my
excuses
in
such
italian
as
i
knew
and
eking
out
by
signs
they
grinned
had
lost
my
company
they
grinned
was
an
hungered
still
they
grinned
and
spoke
to
one
another
in
a
tongue
i
knew
not
at
last
one
gave
me
a
piece
of
bread
and
a
tin
mug
of
wine
as
i
thought
but
it
was
spirits
neat
i
made
a
wry
face
and
asked
for
water
then
these
wild
men
laughed
a
horrible
laugh
i
thought
to
fly
but
looking
towards
the
door
it
was
bolted
with
two
enormous
bolts
of
iron
and
now
first
as
i
ate
my
bread
i
saw
it
was
all
guarded
too
and
ribbed
with
iron
my
blood
curdled
within
me
and
yet
i
could
not
tell
thee
why
but
hadst
thou
seen
the
faces
wild
stupid
and
ruthless
i
mumbled
my
bread
not
to
let
them
see
i
feared
them
but
oh
it
cost
me
to
swallow
it
and
keep
it
in
me
then
it
whirled
in
my
brain
was
there
no
way
to
escape
said
i
will
not
let
me
forth
by
the
door
these
be
smugglers
or
robbers
so
i
feigned
drowsiness
and
taking
out
two
batzen
said
men
for
our
lady
grace
let
me
lie
on
a
bed
and
sleep
for
i
am
faint
with
travel
they
nodded
and
grinned
their
horrible
grin
and
bade
one
light
a
lanthorn
and
lead
me
he
took
me
up
a
winding
staircase
up
up
and
i
saw
no
windows
but
the
wooden
walls
were
pierced
like
a
barbican
tower
and
methinks
for
the
same
purpose
and
through
these
slits
i
got
glimpses
of
the
sky
and
thought
i
see
thee
again
he
took
me
to
the
very
top
of
the
mill
and
there
was
a
room
with
a
heap
of
straw
in
one
corner
and
many
empty
barrels
and
by
the
wall
a
truckle
bed
he
pointed
to
it
and
went
downstairs
heavily
taking
the
light
for
in
this
room
was
a
great
window
and
the
moon
came
in
bright
i
looked
out
to
see
and
lo
it
was
so
high
that
even
the
mill
sails
at
their
highest
came
not
up
to
my
window
by
some
feet
but
turned
very
slow
and
stately
underneath
for
wind
there
was
scarce
a
breath
and
the
trees
seemed
silver
filagree
made
by
angel
craftsmen
my
hope
of
flight
was
gone
but
now
those
wild
faces
being
out
of
sight
i
smiled
at
my
fears
what
an
if
they
were
ill
men
would
it
profit
them
to
hurt
me
natheless
for
caution
against
surprise
i
would
put
the
bed
against
the
door
i
went
to
move
it
but
could
not
it
was
free
at
the
head
but
at
the
foot
fast
clamped
with
iron
to
the
floor
so
i
flung
my
psaltery
on
the
bed
but
for
myself
made
a
layer
of
straw
at
the
door
so
as
none
could
open
on
me
unawares
and
i
laid
my
sword
ready
to
my
hand
and
said
my
prayers
for
thee
and
me
and
turned
to
sleep
below
they
drank
and
made
merry
and
hearing
this
gave
me
confidence
said
i
of
sight
out
of
mind
another
hour
and
the
good
schiedam
will
make
them
forget
that
i
am
here
and
so
i
composed
myself
to
sleep
and
for
some
time
could
not
for
the
boisterous
mirth
below
at
last
i
dropped
off
how
long
i
slept
i
knew
not
but
i
woke
with
a
start
the
noise
had
ceased
below
and
the
sudden
silence
woke
me
and
scarce
was
i
awake
when
sudden
the
truckle
bed
was
gone
with
a
loud
clang
all
but
the
feet
and
the
floor
yawned
and
i
heard
my
psaltery
fall
and
break
to
atoms
deep
deep
below
the
very
floor
of
the
mill
it
had
fallen
into
a
well
and
so
had
i
done
lying
where
it
margaret
shuddered
and
put
her
face
in
her
hands
but
speedily
resumed
i
lay
stupefied
at
first
then
horror
fell
on
me
and
i
rose
but
stood
rooted
there
shaking
from
head
to
foot
at
last
i
found
myself
looking
down
into
that
fearsome
gap
and
my
very
hair
did
bristle
as
i
peered
and
then
i
remember
i
turned
quite
calm
and
made
up
my
mind
to
die
sword
in
hand
for
i
saw
no
man
must
know
this
their
bloody
secret
and
live
and
i
said
margaret
and
i
took
out
of
my
bosom
where
they
lie
ever
our
marriage
lines
and
kissed
them
again
and
again
and
i
pinned
them
to
my
shirt
again
that
they
might
lie
in
one
grave
with
me
if
die
i
must
and
i
thought
our
love
and
hopes
to
end
thus
eli
whisht
all
their
marriage
lines
give
her
time
but
no
word
i
can
bear
no
chat
my
poor
lad
during
the
long
pause
that
ensued
catherine
leaned
forward
and
passed
something
adroitly
from
her
own
lap
under
her
daughter
apron
who
sat
next
her
presently
thinking
all
in
a
whirl
of
all
that
ever
passed
between
us
and
taking
leave
of
all
those
pleasant
hours
i
called
to
mind
how
one
day
at
sevenbergen
thou
taughtest
me
to
make
a
rope
of
straw
mindest
thou
the
moment
memory
brought
that
happy
day
back
to
me
i
cried
out
very
loud
gives
me
a
chance
for
life
even
here
i
woke
from
my
lethargy
i
seized
on
the
straw
and
twisted
it
eagerly
as
thou
didst
teach
me
but
my
fingers
trembled
and
delayed
the
task
whiles
i
wrought
i
heard
a
door
open
below
that
was
a
terrible
moment
even
as
i
twisted
my
rope
i
got
to
the
window
and
looked
down
at
the
great
arms
of
the
mill
coming
slowly
up
then
passing
then
turning
less
slowly
down
as
it
seemed
and
i
thought
go
not
as
when
there
is
wind
yet
slow
or
fast
what
man
rid
ever
on
such
steed
as
these
and
lived
yet
said
i
trust
to
them
and
god
than
to
ill
men
and
i
prayed
to
him
whom
even
the
wind
obeyeth
dear
margaret
i
fastened
my
rope
and
let
myself
gently
down
and
fixed
my
eye
on
that
huge
arm
of
the
mill
which
then
was
creeping
up
to
me
and
went
to
spring
on
to
it
but
my
heart
failed
me
at
the
pinch
and
methought
it
was
not
near
enow
and
it
passed
calm
and
awful
by
i
watched
for
another
they
were
three
and
after
a
little
while
one
crept
up
slower
than
the
rest
methought
and
i
with
my
foot
thrust
myself
in
good
time
somewhat
out
from
the
wall
and
crying
aloud
did
grip
with
all
my
soul
the
of
the
sail
and
that
moment
was
swimming
in
the
giles
well
done
well
done
motion
i
felt
little
but
the
stars
seemed
to
go
round
the
sky
and
then
the
grass
came
up
to
me
nearer
and
nearer
and
when
the
hoary
grass
was
quite
close
i
was
sent
rolling
along
it
as
if
hurled
from
a
catapult
and
got
up
breathless
and
every
point
and
tie
about
me
broken
i
rose
but
fell
down
again
in
agony
i
had
but
one
leg
i
could
stand
catherine
eh
dear
his
leg
is
broke
my
boy
leg
is
and
as
i
lay
groaning
i
heard
a
sound
like
thunder
it
was
the
assassins
running
up
the
stairs
the
crazy
old
mill
shook
under
them
they
must
have
found
that
i
had
not
fallen
into
their
bloody
trap
and
were
running
to
despatch
me
margaret
i
felt
no
fear
for
i
had
now
no
hope
i
could
neither
run
nor
hide
so
wild
the
place
so
bright
the
moon
i
struggled
up
all
agony
and
revenge
more
like
some
wounded
wild
beast
than
your
gerard
leaning
on
my
sword
hilt
i
hobbled
round
and
swift
as
lighting
or
vengeance
i
heaped
a
great
pile
of
their
hay
and
wood
at
the
mill
door
then
drove
my
dagger
into
a
barrel
of
their
smuggled
spirits
and
flung
it
on
then
out
with
my
tinder
and
lighted
the
pile
will
bring
true
men
round
my
dead
body
said
i
i
cried
you
i
die
alone
cowards
assassins
reckless
fiends
and
at
each
word
on
went
a
barrel
pierced
but
oh
margaret
the
fire
fed
by
the
spirits
surprised
me
it
shot
up
and
singed
my
very
hair
it
went
roaring
up
the
side
of
the
mill
swift
as
falls
the
lightning
and
i
yelled
and
laughed
in
my
torture
and
despair
and
pierced
more
barrels
and
the
very
and
flung
them
on
the
fire
roared
like
a
lion
for
its
prey
and
voices
answered
it
inside
from
the
top
of
the
mill
and
the
feet
came
thundering
down
and
i
stood
as
near
that
awful
fire
as
i
could
with
uplifted
sword
to
slay
and
be
slain
the
bolt
was
drawn
a
caught
fire
the
door
was
opened
what
followed
not
the
men
came
out
but
the
fire
rushed
in
at
them
like
a
living
death
and
the
first
i
thought
to
fight
with
was
blackened
and
crumpled
on
the
floor
like
a
leaf
one
fearsome
yell
and
dumb
for
ever
the
feet
ran
up
again
but
fewer
i
heard
them
hack
with
their
swords
a
little
way
up
at
the
mill
wooden
sides
but
they
had
no
time
to
hew
their
way
out
the
fire
and
reek
were
at
their
heels
and
the
smoke
burst
out
at
every
loophole
and
oozed
blue
in
the
moonlight
through
each
crevice
i
hobbled
back
racked
with
pain
and
fury
there
were
white
faces
up
at
my
window
they
saw
me
they
cursed
me
i
cursed
them
back
and
shook
my
naked
sword
down
the
road
i
came
i
cried
ye
must
come
one
by
one
and
as
ye
come
ye
die
upon
this
steel
some
cursed
at
that
but
others
wailed
for
i
had
them
all
at
deadly
vantage
and
doubtless
with
my
face
and
fiendish
rage
i
looked
a
demon
and
now
there
was
a
steady
roar
inside
the
mill
the
flame
was
going
up
it
as
furnace
up
its
chimney
the
mill
caught
fire
fire
glimmered
through
it
tongues
of
flame
darted
through
each
loophole
and
shot
sparks
and
fiery
flakes
into
the
night
one
of
the
assassins
leaped
on
to
the
sail
as
i
had
done
in
his
hurry
he
missed
his
grasp
and
fell
at
my
feet
and
bounded
from
the
hard
ground
like
a
ball
and
never
spoke
nor
moved
again
and
the
rest
screamed
like
women
and
with
their
despair
came
back
to
me
both
ruth
for
them
and
hope
of
life
for
myself
and
the
fire
gnawed
through
the
mill
in
placen
and
shot
forth
showers
of
great
flat
sparks
like
flakes
of
fiery
snow
and
the
sails
caught
fire
one
after
another
and
i
became
a
man
again
and
staggered
away
leaning
on
my
sword
from
the
sight
of
my
revenge
and
with
great
bodily
pain
crawled
back
to
the
road
and
dear
margaret
the
rimy
trees
were
now
all
like
pyramids
of
golden
filagree
and
lace
cobweb
fine
in
the
red
firelight
oh
most
beautiful
and
a
poor
wretch
got
entangled
in
the
burning
sails
and
whirled
round
screaming
and
lost
hold
at
the
wrong
time
and
hurled
like
stone
from
mangonel
high
into
the
air
then
a
dull
thump
it
was
his
carcass
striking
the
earth
the
next
moment
there
was
a
loud
crash
the
mill
fell
in
on
its
destroyer
and
a
million
great
sparks
flew
up
and
the
sails
fell
over
the
burning
wreck
and
at
that
a
million
more
sparks
flew
up
and
the
ground
was
strewn
with
burning
wood
and
men
i
prayed
god
forgive
me
and
kneeling
with
my
back
to
that
fiery
shambles
i
saw
lights
on
the
road
a
welcome
sight
it
was
a
company
coming
towards
me
and
scarce
two
furlongs
off
i
hobbled
towards
them
ere
i
had
gone
far
i
heard
a
swift
step
behind
me
i
turned
one
had
escaped
how
escaped
who
can
divine
his
sword
shone
in
the
moonlight
i
feared
him
methought
the
ghosts
of
all
those
dead
sat
on
that
glittering
glaive
i
put
my
other
foot
to
the
ground
maugre
the
anguish
and
fled
towards
the
torches
moaning
with
pain
and
shouting
for
aid
but
what
could
i
do
he
gained
on
me
behooved
me
turn
and
fight
denys
had
taught
me
sword
play
in
sport
i
wheeled
our
swords
clashed
his
clothes
they
smelled
all
singed
i
cut
swiftly
upward
with
supple
hand
and
his
dangled
bleeding
at
the
wrist
and
his
sword
fell
it
tinkled
on
the
ground
i
raised
my
sword
to
hew
him
should
he
stoop
he
stood
and
cursed
me
he
drew
his
dagger
with
his
left
i
opposed
my
point
and
dared
him
with
my
eye
to
close
a
great
shout
arose
behind
me
from
true
men
throats
he
started
he
spat
at
me
in
his
rage
then
gnashed
his
teeth
and
fled
blaspheming
i
turned
and
saw
torches
close
at
hand
lo
they
fell
to
dancing
up
and
down
methought
and
the
i
had
ah
catherine
here
help
water
stand
aloof
you
that
be
men
margaret
had
fainted
away
chapter
liv
when
she
recovered
her
head
was
on
catherine
arm
and
the
honest
half
of
the
family
she
had
invaded
like
a
foe
stood
round
her
uttering
rough
homely
words
of
encouragement
especially
giles
who
roared
at
her
that
she
was
not
to
take
on
like
that
gerard
was
alive
and
well
or
he
could
not
have
writ
this
letter
the
biggest
mankind
had
seen
as
yet
and
as
he
thought
the
beautifullest
and
most
moving
and
smallest
ay
good
master
giles
sighed
margaret
feebly
he
was
alive
but
how
know
i
what
hath
since
befallen
him
oh
why
left
he
holland
to
go
among
strangers
fierce
as
lions
and
why
did
i
not
drive
him
from
me
sooner
than
part
him
from
his
own
flesh
and
blood
forgive
me
you
that
are
his
mother
and
she
gently
removed
catherine
arm
and
made
a
feeble
attempt
to
slide
off
the
chair
on
to
her
knees
which
after
a
brief
struggle
with
superior
force
ended
in
her
finding
herself
on
catherine
bosom
then
margaret
held
out
the
letter
to
eli
and
said
faintly
but
sweetly
i
will
trust
it
from
my
hand
now
in
sooth
i
am
little
fit
to
read
any
loth
to
leave
my
comfort
and
she
wreathed
her
other
arm
round
catherine
neck
read
thou
richart
said
eli
thine
eyes
be
younger
than
richart
took
the
letter
well
said
he
such
writing
saw
i
never
a
writeth
with
a
needle
point
and
clear
to
boot
why
is
he
not
in
my
at
amsterdam
instead
of
vagabonding
it
out
yonder
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
seated
in
the
litter
and
my
good
merchant
holding
of
my
hand
i
babbled
i
know
not
what
and
then
shuddered
awhile
in
silence
he
put
a
horn
of
wine
to
my
catherine
bless
him
bless
him
eli
whisht
and
i
told
him
what
had
befallen
he
would
see
my
leg
it
was
sprained
sore
and
swelled
at
the
ankle
and
all
my
points
were
broken
as
i
could
scarce
keep
up
my
hose
and
i
said
i
shall
be
but
a
burden
to
you
i
doubt
and
can
make
you
no
harmony
now
my
poor
psaltery
it
is
broken
and
i
did
grieve
over
my
broken
music
companion
of
so
many
weary
leagues
but
he
patted
me
on
the
cheek
and
bade
me
not
fret
also
he
did
put
up
my
leg
on
a
pillow
and
tended
me
like
a
kind
father
january
i
sit
all
day
in
the
litter
for
we
are
pushing
forward
with
haste
and
at
night
the
good
kind
merchant
sendeth
me
to
bed
and
will
not
let
me
work
strange
i
fall
in
with
men
like
fiends
then
the
next
moment
god
still
sendeth
me
some
good
man
or
woman
lest
i
should
turn
away
from
human
kind
oh
margaret
how
strangely
mixed
they
be
and
how
old
i
am
by
what
i
was
three
months
agone
and
lo
if
good
master
fugger
hath
not
been
and
bought
me
a
catherine
eli
my
man
an
yon
merchant
comes
our
way
let
us
buy
a
hundred
ells
of
cloth
of
him
and
not
eli
that
will
i
take
your
oath
o
while
richart
prepared
to
read
kate
looked
at
her
mother
and
with
a
faint
blush
drew
out
the
piece
of
work
from
under
her
apron
and
sewed
with
head
depressed
a
little
more
than
necessary
on
this
her
mother
drew
a
piece
of
work
out
of
her
pocket
and
sewed
too
while
richart
read
both
the
specimens
these
sweet
surreptitious
creatures
now
first
exposed
to
observation
were
babies
caps
and
more
than
half
finished
which
told
a
tale
horror
they
were
like
little
monks
cowls
in
shape
and
delicacy
january
laid
up
in
the
litter
and
as
good
as
blind
but
halting
to
bait
lombardy
plains
burst
on
me
oh
margaret
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
all
sloping
plains
goodly
rivers
jocund
meadows
delectable
orchards
and
blooming
gardens
and
though
winter
looks
warmer
than
poor
beloved
holland
at
midsummer
and
makes
the
face
to
shine
and
his
heart
to
leap
for
joy
to
see
earth
so
kind
and
smiling
here
be
vines
cedars
olives
and
cattle
plenty
but
three
goats
to
a
sheep
the
draught
oxen
wear
white
linen
on
their
necks
and
standing
by
dark
green
each
one
is
a
picture
and
the
folk
especially
women
wear
delicate
strawen
hats
with
flowers
and
leaves
fairly
imitated
in
silk
with
silver
mixed
this
day
we
crossed
a
river
prettily
in
a
chained
on
either
bank
was
a
windlass
and
a
single
man
by
turning
of
it
drew
our
whole
company
to
his
shore
whereat
i
did
admire
being
a
stranger
passed
over
with
us
some
country
folk
and
an
old
woman
looking
at
a
young
wench
she
did
hide
her
face
with
her
hand
and
held
her
crucifix
out
like
knight
his
sword
in
tourney
dreading
the
evil
eye
january
safe
at
venice
a
place
whose
strange
and
passing
beauty
is
well
known
to
thee
by
report
of
our
mariners
dost
mind
too
how
peter
would
oft
fill
our
ears
withal
we
handed
beneath
the
table
and
he
still
discoursing
of
this
and
peerless
city
in
shape
a
bow
and
its
great
canal
and
palaces
on
piles
and
its
watery
ways
plied
by
scores
of
gilded
boats
and
that
of
nations
orbis

forum
mark
his
place
and
his
statue
with
the
peerless
jewels
in
his
eyes
and
the
lion
at
his
gate
but
i
lying
at
my
window
in
pain
may
see
none
of
these
beauties
as
yet
but
only
a
street
fairly
paved
which
is
dull
and
houses
with
oiled
paper
and
linen
in
lieu
of
glass
which
is
rude
and
the
their
habits
and
their
gestures
wherein
they
are
superfluous
therefore
not
to
miss
my
daily
comfort
of
whispering
to
thee
i
will
turn
mine
eyes
inward
and
bind
my
sheaves
of
wisdom
reaped
by
travel
for
i
love
thee
so
that
no
treasure
pleases
me
not
shared
with
thee
and
what
treasure
so
good
and
enduring
as
knowledge
this
then
have
i
sir
footsore
learned
that
each
nation
hath
its
proper
wisdom
and
its
proper
folly
and
methinks
could
a
great
king
or
duke
tramp
like
me
and
see
with
his
own
eyes
he
might
pick
the
flowers
and
eschew
the
weeds
of
nations
and
go
home
and
set
his
own
folk
on
wisdom
hill
the
germans
in
the
north
were
churlish
but
frank
and
honest
in
the
south
kindly
and
honest
too
their
general
blot
is
drunkenness
the
which
they
carry
even
to
mislike
and
contempt
of
sober
men
they
say
commonly
niecht
sauffen
und
fressen
so
kanstu
kienem
hern
wol
dienen
in
england
the
vulgar
sort
drink
as
deep
but
the
worshipful
hold
excess
in
this
a
reproach
and
drink
a
health
or
two
for
courtesy
not
gluttony
and
still
sugar
the
wine
in
their
cups
the
germans
use
little
mirth
or
discourse
but
ply
the
business
sadly
crying
frolich
the
best
of
their
drunken
sport
is
a
way
of
drinking
with
touching
deftly
of
the
glass
the
beard
the
table
in
due
turn
intermixed
with
whistlings
and
snappings
of
the
finger
so
curiously
ordered
as
is
a
labour
of
hercules
but
to
the
beholder
right
pleasant
and
mirthful
their
topers
by
advice
of
german
leeches
sleep
with
pebbles
in
their
mouths
for
as
of
a
boiling
pot
the
lid
must
be
set
ajar
so
with
these
fleshy
to
vent
the
heat
of
their
inward
parts
spite
of
which
many
die
suddenly
from
drink
but
is
a
matter
of
religion
to
slur
it
and
gloze
it
and
charge
some
innocent
disease
therewith
yet
is
more
a
custom
than
very
nature
for
their
women
come
among
the
tipplers
and
do
but
stand
a
moment
and
as
it
were
kiss
the
and
are
indeed
most
temperate
in
eating
and
drinking
and
of
all
women
modest
and
virtuous
and
true
spouses
and
friends
to
their
mates
far
before
our
holland
lasses
that
being
maids
put
the
question
to
the
men
and
being
wived
do
lord
it
over
them
why
there
is
a
wife
in
tergou
not
far
from
our
door
one
came
to
the
house
and
sought
her
man
says
she
not
find
him
he
asked
my
leave
to
go
abroad
this
afternoon
and
i
did
give
it
him
catherine
is
sooth
is
sooth
was
beck

jonah
wife
this
comes
of
a
woman
wedding
a
in
the
south
where
wine
is
the
gentry
drink
themselves
bare
but
not
in
the
north
for
with
beer
a
noble
shall
sooner
burst
his
body
than
melt
his
lands
they
are
quarrelsome
but
is
the
liquor
not
the
mind
for
they
are
none
revengeful
and
when
they
have
made
a
bad
bargain
drunk
they
stand
to
it
sober
they
keep
their
windows
bright
and
judge
a
man
by
his
clothes
whatever
fruit
or
grain
or
herb
grows
by
the
roadside
gather
and
eat
the
owner
seeing
you
shall
say
welcome
honest
man
but
an
ye
pluck
a
wayside
grape
your
very
life
is
in
jeopardy
is
eating
of
that
heaven
gave
to
be
drunken
the
french
are
much
fairer
spoken
and
not
nigh
so
sweet
words
cost
them
nought
they
call
it
payer
en
denys
les
coquins
ha
ha
natheless
courtesy
is
in
their
hearts
ay
in
their
very
blood
they
say
commonly
yourself
the
trouble
of
sitting
down
and
such
straws
of
speech
show
how
blows
the
wind
also
at
a
public
show
if
you
would
leave
your
seat
yet
not
lose
it
tie
but
your
napkin
round
the
bench
and
no
french
man
or
woman
will
sit
here
but
rather
keep
the
place
for
catherine
gramercy
that
is
manners
france
for
me
denys
rose
and
placed
his
hand
gracefully
to
his
breastplate
natheless
they
say
things
in
sport
which
are
not
courteous
but
shocking
diable
au
diable
and
so
forth
but
i
trow
they
mean
not
such
dreadful
wishes
custom
belike
moderate
in
drinking
and
mix
water
with
their
wine
and
sing
and
dance
over
their
cups
and
are
then
enchanting
company
they
are
curious
not
to
drink
in
another
man
cup
in
war
the
english
gain
the
better
of
them
in
the
field
but
the
french
are
their
masters
in
attack
and
defence
of
cities
witness
orleans
where
they
besieged
their
besiegers
and
hashed
them
sore
with
their
double
and
treble
culverines
and
many
other
sieges
in
this
our
century
more
than
all
nations
they
flatter
their
women
and
despise
them
no
she
may
be
their
sovereign
ruler
also
they
often
hang
their
female
malefactors
instead
of
drowning
them
decently
as
other
nations
use
the
furniture
in
their
inns
is
walnut
in
germany
only
deal
french
windows
are
ill
the
lower
half
is
of
wood
and
opens
the
upper
half
is
of
glass
but
fixed
so
that
the
servant
can
not
come
at
it
to
clean
it
the
german
windows
are
all
glass
and
movable
and
shine
far
and
near
like
diamonds
in
france
many
mean
houses
are
not
glazed
at
all
once
i
saw
a
frenchman
pass
a
church
without
unbonneting
this
i
witnessed
in
holland
germany
or
italy
at
many
inns
they
show
the
traveller
his
sheets
to
give
him
assurance
they
are
clean
and
warm
them
at
the
fire
before
him
a
laudable
custom
they
receive
him
kindly
and
like
a
guest
they
mostly
cheat
him
and
whiles
cut
his
throat
they
plead
in
excuse
hard
and
tyrannous
laws
and
true
it
is
their
law
thrusteth
its
nose
into
every
platter
and
its
finger
into
every
pie
in
france
worshipful
men
wear
their
hats
and
their
furs
indoors
and
go
abroad
lighter
clad
in
germany
they
don
hat
and
furred
cloak
to
go
abroad
but
sit
bareheaded
and
light
clad
round
the
stove
the
french
intermix
not
the
men
and
women
folk
in
assemblies
as
we
hollanders
use
round
their
preachers
the
women
sit
on
their
heels
in
rows
and
the
men
stand
behind
them
their
harvests
are
rye
and
flax
and
wine
three
mules
shall
you
see
to
one
horse
and
whole
flocks
of
sheep
as
black
as
coal
in
germany
the
snails
be
red
i
lie
not
the
french
buy
minstrelsy
but
breed
jests
and
make
their
own
mirth
the
germans
foster
their
set
fools
with
which
move
them
to
laughter
by
simulating
madness
a
calamity
that
asks
pity
not
laughter
in
this
particular
i
deem
that
lighter
nation
wiser
than
the
graver
german
what
sayest
thou
alas
canst
not
answer
me
now
in
germany
the
petty
laws
are
wondrous
wise
and
just
those
against
criminals
bloody
in
france
bloodier
still
and
executed
a
trifle
more
cruelly
there
here
the
wheel
is
common
and
the
fiery
stake
and
under
this
king
they
drown
men
by
the
score
in
paris
river
seine
yclept
but
the
english
are
as
peremptory
in
hanging
and
drowning
for
a
light
fault
so
travellers
report
finally
a
frenchman
when
ye
chance
on
one
is
a
man
as
near
perfect
as
earth
affords
and
such
a
man
is
my
denys
spite
of
his
foul
denys
my
foul
mouth
is
that
so
writ
master
richart
richart
ay
in
sooth
see
denys
inspecting
the
letter
gravely
i
read
not
the
letter
richart
how
then
denys
humph
ahem
why
just
the
he
added
is
kittle
work
perusing
of
these
black
scratches
men
are
agreed
to
take
for
words
and
i
trow
is
still
by
guess
you
clerks
do
go
worthy
sir
my
foul
mouth
this
is
the
first
time
i
heard
o
eh
mesdames
but
the
females
did
not
seize
the
opportunity
he
gave
them
and
burst
into
a
loud
and
general
disclaimer
margaret
blushed
and
said
nothing
the
other
two
bent
silently
over
their
work
with
something
very
like
a
sly
smile
denys
inspected
their
countenances
long
and
carefully
and
the
perusal
was
so
satisfactory
that
he
turned
with
a
tone
of
injured
but
patient
innocence
and
bade
richart
read
on
the
italians
are
a
polished
and
subtle
people
they
judge
a
man
not
by
his
habits
but
his
speech
and
gesture
here
sir
chough
may
by
no
means
pass
for
falcon
gentle
as
did
i
in
germany
pranked
in
my
noble
servant
feathers
wisest
of
all
nations
in
their
singular
temperance
of
food
and
drink
most
foolish
of
all
to
search
strangers
coming
into
their
borders
and
stay
them
from
bringing
much
money
in
they
should
rather
invite
it
and
like
other
nations
let
the
traveller
from
taking
of
it
out
also
here
in
venice
the
dames
turn
their
black
hair
yellow
by
the
sun
and
art
to
be
wiser
than
him
who
made
them
ye
enter
no
italian
town
without
a
bill
of
health
though
now
is
no
plague
in
europe
this
peevishness
is
for
extortion
sake
the
innkeepers
cringe
and
fawn
and
cheat
and
in
country
places
murder
you
yet
will
they
give
you
clean
sheets
by
paying
therefor
delicate
in
eating
and
abhor
from
putting
their
hand
in
the
plate
sooner
they
will
apply
a
crust
or
what
not
they
do
even
tell
of
a
cardinal
at
rome
which
armeth
his
guest
left
hand
with
a
little
bifurcal
dagger
to
hold
the
meat
while
his
knife
cutteth
it
but
methinks
this
too
is
to
be
wiser
than
him
who
made
the
hand
so
supple
and
eli
i
am
of
your
mind
my
they
are
sore
troubled
with
the
itch
and
ointment
for
it
unguento
per
la

is
cried
at
every
corner
of
venice
from
this
my
window
i
saw
an
urchin

it
to
three
several
dames
in
silken
trains
and
to
two
velvet
catherine

my
lass

your
body
i
the

and
then
ye

i
the
plate
o
thursday
withouten
their
bread
is
lovely
white
their
meats
they
spoil
with
sprinkling
cheese
over
them
o
perversity
their
salt
is
black
without
a
lie
in
commerce
these
venetians
are
masters
of
the
earth
and
sea
and
govern
their
territories
wisely
only
one
flaw
i
find
the
same
i
once
heard
a
learned
friar
cast
up
against
plato
his
republic
to
wit
that
here
women
are
encouraged
to
venal
frailty
and
do
pay
a
tax
to
the
state
which
not
content
with
silk
and
spice
and
other
rich
and
honest
freights
good
store
must
trade
in
sin
twenty
thousand
of
these
jezebels
there
be
in
venice
and
candia
and
about
pampered
and
honoured
for
bringing
strangers
to
the
city
and
many
live
in
princely
palaces
of
their
own
but
herein
methinks
the
politic
signors
of
venice
forget
what
king
david
saith
the
lord
keep
the
city
the
watchman
waketh
but
in
vain
also
in
religion
they
hang
their
cloth
according
to
the
wind
siding
now
with
the
pope
now
with
the
turk
but
aye
with
the
god
of
traders
mammon
hight
shall
flower
so
cankered
bloom
to
the
end
but
since
i
speak
of
flowers
this
none
may
deny
them
that
they
are
most
cunning
in
making
roses
and
gilliflowers
to
blow
unseasonably
in
summer
they
nip
certain
of
the
budding
roses
and
water
them
not
then
in
winter
they
dig
round
these
discouraged
plants
and
put
in
cloves
and
so
with
great
art
rear
roses
and
bring
them
to
market
in
january
and
did
first
learn
this
art
of
a
cow
buds
she
grazed
in
summer
and
they
sprouted
at
yule
women
have
sat
in
the
doctors

at
their

but
she
that
sat
in

was
a
german
italy
too
for
artful
fountains
and
figures
that
move
by
water
and
enact
life
and
next
for
fountains
is
augsburg
where
they
harness
the
foul
knave
smoke
to
good
sir
spit
and
he
turneth
stout
master
roast
but
lest
any
one
place
should
vaunt
two
towns
there
be
in

which
scorning
giddy
fountains
bring
water
tame
in

to
every

is
london
so
watered
this
many
a
year
by
pipes
of
a
league
from
paddington
a
neighbouring
city
and
the
other
is
the
fair
town
of
lubeck
also
the
fierce
english
are
reported
to
me
wise
in
that
they
will
not
share
their
land
and
flocks
with
wolves
but
have
fairly
driven
those
marauders
into
their
mountains
but
neither
in
france
nor
germany
nor
italy
is
a
wayfarer
life
safe
from
the
vagabones
after
sundown
i
can
hear
of
no
glazed
house
in
all
venice
but
only
oiled
linen
and
paper
and
behind
these
barbarian
eyelets
a
wooden
jalosy
their
name
for
a
cowardly
assassin
is
brave
man
and
for
an
harlot
courteous
person
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
a
woman
worst
vice
and
a
man
worst
vice
are
virtues
but
i
pray
god
for
little
holland
that
there
an
assassin
may
be
yclept
an
assassin
and
an
harlot
an
harlot
till
domesday
and
then
gloze
foul
faults
with
silken
names
who
can
eli
with
a
sigh
he
should
have
been
a
priest
saving
your
presence
my
poor
january
sweetheart
i
must
be
brief
and
tell
thee
but
a
part
of
that
i
have
seen
for
this
day
my
journal
ends
it
sails
for
thee
and
i
unhappy
not
with
it
but
in
another
ship
to
rome
dear
margaret
i
took
a
hand
litter
and
was
carried
to
mark
his
church
outside
it
towards
the
is
a
noble
gallery
and
above
it
four
famous
horses
cut
in
brass
by
the
ancient
romans
and
seem
all
moving
and
at
the
very
next
step
must
needs
leap
down
on
the
beholder
about
the
church
are
six
hundred
pillars
of
marble
porphyry
and
ophites
inside
is
a
treasure
greater
than
either
at
denys
or
loretto
or
toledo
here
a
jewelled
pitcher
given
the
seigniory
by
a
persian
king
also
the
ducal
cap
blazing
with
jewels
and
on
its
crown
a
diamond
and
a
chrysolite
each
as
big
as
an
almond
two
golden
crowns
and
twelve
golden
stomachers
studded
with
jewels
from
constantinople
item
a
monstrous
sapphire
item
a
great
diamond
given
by
a
french
king
item
a
prodigious
carbuncle
item
three
unicorns
horns
but
what
are
these
compared
with
the
sacred
relics
dear
margaret
i
stood
and
saw
the
brazen
chest
that
holds
the
body
of
mark
the
evangelist
i
saw
with
these
eyes
and
handled
his
ring
and
his
gospel
written
with
his
own
hand
and
all
my
travels
seemed
light
for
who
am
i
that
i
should
see
such
things
dear
margaret
his
sacred
body
was
first
brought
from
alexandria
by
merchants
in
and
then
not
prized
as
now
for
between
when
this
church
was
builded
and
the
very
place
where
it
lay
was
forgotten
then
holy
priests
fasted
and
prayed
many
days
seeking
for
light
and
lo
the
body
brake
at
midnight
through
the
marble
and
stood
before
them
they
fell
to
the
earth
but
in
the
morning
found
the
crevice
the
sacred
body
had
burst
through
and
peering
through
it
saw
him
lie
then
they
took
and
laid
him
in
his
chest
beneath
the
altar
and
carefully
put
back
the
stone
with
its
miraculous
crevice
which
crevice
i
saw
and
shall
gape
for
a
monument
while
the
world
lasts
after
that
they
showed
me
the
virgin
chair
it
is
of
stone
also
her
picture
painted
by
luke
very
dark
and
the
features
now
scarce
visible
this
picture
in
time
of
drought
they
carry
in
procession
and
brings
the
rain
i
wish
i
had
not
seen
it
item
two
pieces
of
marble
spotted
with
john
the
blood
item
a
piece
of
the
true
cross
and
of
the
pillar
to
which
christ
was
tied
item
the
rock
struck
by
moses
and
wet
to
this
hour
also
a
stone
christ
sat
on
preaching
at
tyre
but
some
say
it
is
the
one
the
patriarch
jacob
laid
his
head
on
and
i
hold
with
them
by
reason
our
lord
never
preached
at
tyre
going
hence
they
showed
me
the
state
nursery
for
the
children
of
those
aphrodisian
dames
their
favourites
here
in
the
outer
wall
was
a
broad
niche
and
if
they
bring
them
so
little
as
they
can
squeeze
them
through
it
alive
the
bairn
falls
into
a
net
inside
and
the
state
takes
charge
of
it
but
if
too
big
their
mothers
must
even
take
them
home
again
with
whom
abiding
like
to
be
mali
corvi
mali
ovum
coming
out
of
the
church
we
met
them
carrying
in
a
corpse
with
the
feet
and
face
bare
this
i
then
first
learned
is
venetian
custom
and
sure
no
other
town
will
ever
rob
them
of
it
nor
of
this
that
follows
on
a
great
porphyry
slab
in
the
piazza
were
three
ghastly
heads
rotting
and
tainting
the
air
and
in
their
hot
summers
like
to
take
vengeance
with
breeding
of
a
plague
these
were
traitors
to
the
state
and
a
heavy
price
two
thousand
ducats
being
put
on
each
head
their
friends
had
slain
them
and
brought
all
three
to
the
slab
and
so
sold
blood
of
others
and
their
own
faith
no
state
buys
heads
so
many
nor
pays
half
so
high
a
price
for
that
sorry
merchandise
but
what
i
most
admired
was
to
see
over
against
the
duke
palace
a
fair
gallows
in
alabaster
reared
express
to
bring
him
and
no
other
for
the
least
treason
to
the
state
and
there
it
stands
in
his
eye
whispering
him
memento
mori
i
pondered
and
owned
these
signors
my
masters
who
will
let
no
man
not
even
their
sovereign
be
above
the
common
weal
hard
by
on
a
wall
the
workmen
were
just
finishing
by
order
of
the
seigniory
the
stone
effigy
of
a
tragical
and
enormous
act
enacted
last
year
yet
on
the
wall
looks
innocent
here
two
gentle
folks
whisper
together
and
there
other
twain
their
swords
by
their
side
four
brethren
were
they
which
did
on
either
side
conspire
to
poison
the
other
two
and
so
halve
their
land
in
lieu
of
quartering
it
and
at
a
mutual
banquet
these
twain
drugged
the
wine
and
those
twain
envenomed
a
marchpane
to
such
good
purpose
that
the
same
afternoon
lay
four
men
around
one
table
grovelling
in
mortal
agony
and
cursing
of
one
another
and
themselves
and
so
concluded
miserably
and
the
land
for
which
they
had
lost
their
immortal
souls
went
into
another
family
and
why
not
it
could
not
go
into
a
worse
but
o
sovereign
wisdom
of
bywords
how
true
they
put
the
finger
on
each
nation
or
particular
fault
quand
italie
sera
sans
poison
et
france
sans
trahison
et
sans
guerre
lors
sera
le
monde
sans
richart
explained
this
to
catherine
then
proceeded
and
after
this
they
took
me
to
the
quay
and
presently
i
espied
among
the
masts
one
garlanded
with
amaranth
flowers
me
thither
said
i
and
i
let
my
guide
know
the
custom
of
our
dutch
skippers
to
hoist
flowers
to
the
masthead
when
they
are
courting
a
maid
oft
had
i
scoffed
at
this
saying
then
his
wooing
is
the
earth
concern
but
now
so
far
from
the
rotter
that
bunch
at
a
masthead
made
my
heart
leap
with
assurance
of
a
countryman
they
carried
me
and
oh
margaret
on
the
stern
of
that
dutch
boy
was
written
in
muckle
letters
richart
eliassoen
amsterdam
me
down
i
said
our
lady
sake
put
me
down
i
sat
on
the
bank
and
looked
scarce
believing
my
eyes
and
looked
and
presently
fell
to
crying
till
i
could
see
the
words
no
more
ah
me
how
they
went
to
my
heart
those
bare
letters
in
a
foreign
land

i
have
sat
on
his

and

given
me
unkind
word
from
him

i
never
and
there
was
his
name
on
his
own
ship
and
his
face
and
all
his
grave
but
good
and
gentle
ways
came
back
to
me
and
i
sobbed
vehemently
and
cried
aloud
why
is
not
brother
richart
here
and
not
his
name
only
i
spake
in
dutch
for
my
heart

too
full
to
hold
their
foreign
tongues
and

place
to

have
driven
him
so
far

what
i
would
fain

said
catherine
drily
then
fell
to
weeping
and
rocking
herself
with
her
apron
over
her
head
kind
dame
good
friends
said
margaret
trembling
let
me
tell
you
how
the
letter
ends
the
skipper
hearing
our
gerard
speak
his
grief
in
dutch
accosted
him
and
spake
comfortably
to
him
and
after
a
while
our
gerard
found
breath
to
say
he
was
worthy
master
richart
brother
thereat
was
the
good
skipper
all
agog
to
serve
richart
so
so
skipper
master
richart
aforesaid
will
be
at
thy
wedding
and
bring
purse
to
margaret
sir
he
told
gerard
of
his
consort
that
was
to
sail
that
very
night
for
rotterdam
and
dear
gerard
had
to
go
home
and
finish
his
letter
and
bring
it
to
the
ship
and
the
rest
it
is
but
his
poor
dear
words
of
love
to
me
the
which
a
please
you
i
think
shame
to
hear
them
read
aloud
and
ends
with
the
lines
i
sent
to
mistress
kate
and
they
would
sound
so
harsh
now
and
the
pleading
tone
as
much
as
the
words
prevailed
and
richart
said
he
would
read
no
more
aloud
but
run
his
eye
over
it
for
his
own
brotherly
satisfaction
she
blushed
and
looked
uneasy
but
made
no
reply
eli
said
catherine
still
sobbing
a
little
tell
me
for
our
sake
how
our
poor
boy
is
to
live
at
that
nasty
rome
he
is
gone
there
to
write
but
here
he
his
own
words
to
prove
writing
avails
nought
a
had
died
o
hunger
by
the
way
but
for
and
psaltery
well
well
said
eli
he
has
got
brush
and
music
still
besides
so
many
men
so
many
minds
writing
though
it
had
no
sale
in
other
parts
may
be
merchandise
at
father
said
little
kate
have
i
your
good
leave
to
put
in
my
word
mother
and
you
and
welcome
little
then
seems
to
me
painting
and
music
close
at
hand
be
stronger
than
writing
but
being
distant
nought
to
compare
for
see
what
glamour
written
paper
hath
done
here
but
now
our
gerard
writing
at
venice
hath
verily
put
his
hand
into
this
room
at
rotterdam
and
turned
all
our
hearts
ay
dear
dear
gerard
methinks
thy
spirit
hath
rid
hither
on
these
thy
paper
wings
and
oh
dear
father
why
not
do
as
we
should
do
were
he
here
in
the
body
kate
said
eli
fear
not
richart
and
i
will
give
him
glamour
for
glamour
we
will
write
him
a
letter
and
send
it
to
rome
by
a
sure
hand
with
money
and
bid
him
home
on
the
cornelis
and
sybrandt
exchanged
a
gloomy
look
ah
good
father
and
meantime
well
meantime
dear
father
dear
mother
what
can
we
do
to
pleasure
the
absent
but
be
kind
to
his
poor
lass
and
her
own
trouble
afore
her
is
well
said
eli
but
i
am
older
than

he
turned
gravely
to
margaret

answer
me
a
question

pretty
mistress

margaret

my
grief
but
i
doubted

he
said

a
comfort
to
him

have
them

his
a
very
foolish
indeed
i
was
sir
but
trouble

is
a
good
answer
well
foolish
or
no
honest

had
shown

more
respect

first
but
i
thought

his
leman

that

time
for

to
go

letter

not
so
hot

a

to
give
it
her
my
softly
wife
softly
i
am
not
counted
an
unjust
man
though

somewhat
here
richart
broke
in
why
mistress
did
ye
shed
your
blood
for
our
gerard
not
i
sir
but
maybe
i
nay
nay
but
he
says

know
not
what

rede

poor
lad

throw
dust
in
thine
eyes
master
richart
old
martin
tells
me
ye
need
not
make
signals
to
me
i
am
as
blind
as
love
martin
tells
me
she
cut
her
arm
and
let
her
blood
flow
and
smeared
her
heels
when
gerard
was
hunted
by
the
bloodhounds
to
turn
the
scent
from
her
well
and
if
i
did
was
my
own
and
spilled
for
the
good
of
my
own
said
margaret
defiantly
but
catherine
suddenly
clasping
her
she
began
to
cry
at
having
found
a
bosom
to
cry
on
of
one
who
would
have
also
shed
her
blood
for
gerard
in
danger
eli
rose
from
his
chair
wife
said
he
solemnly
you
will
set
another
chair
at
our
table
for
every
meal
also
another
plate
and
knife
they
will
be
for
margaret
and
peter
she
will
come
when
she
likes
and
stay
away
when
she
pleases
none
may
take
her
place
at
my
left
hand
such
as
can
welcome
her
are
welcome
to
me
such
as
can
not
i
force
them
not
to
abide
with
me
the
world
is
wide
and
free
within
my
walls
i
am
master
and
my
son
betrothed
is
catherine
bustled
out
to
prepare
supper
eli
and
richart
sat
down
and
concocted
a
letter
to
bring
gerard
home
richart
promised
it
should
go
by
sea
to
rome
that
very
week
sybrandt
and
cornelis
exchanged
a
gloomy
wink
and
stole
out
margaret
seeing
giles
deep
in
meditation
for
the
dwarf
intelligence
had
taken
giant
strides
asked
him
to
bring
her
the
letter
you
have
heard
but
half
good
master
giles
said
she
shall
i
read
you
the
rest
i
shall
be
much
beholden
to
you
shouted
the
sonorous
atom
she
gave
him
her
stool
curiosity
bowed
his
pride
to
sit
on
it
and
margaret
murmured
the
first
part
of
the
letter
into
his
ear
very
low
not
to
disturb
eli
and
richart
and
to
do
this
she
leaned
forward
and
put
her
lovely
face
cheek
by
jowl
with
giles
hideous
one
a
strange
contrast
and
worth
a
painter
while
to
try
and
represent
and
in
this
attitude
catherine
found
her
and
all
the
mother
warmed
towards
her
and
she
exchanged
an
eloquent
glance
with
little
kate
the
latter
smiled
and
sewed
with
drooping
lashes
get
him
home
on
the
instant
roared
giles
i
make
a
man
of
hear
the
boy
said
catherine
half
comically
half
proudly
we
hear
him
said
richart
a
mostly
makes
himself
heard
when
a
do
sybrandt
which
will
get
to
him
first
cornelis
gloomily
who
can
tell
chapter
lv
about
two
months
before
this
scene
in
eli
home
the
natives
of
a
little
maritime
place
between
naples
and
rome
might
be
seen
flocking
to
the
sea
beach
with
eyes
cast
seaward
at
a
ship
that
laboured
against
a
stiff
gale
blowing
dead
on
the
shore
at
times
she
seemed
likely
to
weather
the
danger
and
then
the
spectators
congratulated
her
aloud
at
others
the
wind
and
sea
drove
her
visibly
nearer
and
the
were
not
without
a
secret
satisfaction
they
would
not
have
owned
even
to
themselves
non
quia
vexari
quemquam
est
jucunda
voluptas
sed
quibus
ipse
malis
careas
quia
cernere
suave
est
and
the
poor
ship
though
not
scientifically
built
for
sailing
was
admirably
constructed
for
going
ashore
with
her
extravagant
poop
that
caught
the
wind
and
her
lines
like
a
cocked
hat
reversed
to
those
on
the
beach
that
battered
labouring
frame
of
wood
seemed
alive
and
struggling
against
death
with
a
panting
heart
but
could
they
have
been
transferred
to
her
deck
they
would
have
seen
she
had
not
one
beating
heart
but
many
and
not
one
nature
but
a
score
were
coming
out
clear
in
that
fearful
hour
the
mariners
stumbled
wildly
about
the
deck
handling
the
ropes
as
each
thought
fit
and
cursing
and
praying
alternately
the
passengers
were
huddled
together
round
the
mast
some
sitting
some
kneeling
some
lying
prostrate
and
grasping
the
bulwarks
as
the
vessel
rolled
and
pitched
in
the
mighty
waves
one
comely
young
man
whose
ashy
cheek
but
compressed
lips
showed
how
hard
terror
was
battling
in
him
with
stood
a
little
apart
holding
tight
by
a
shroud
and
wincing
at
each
sea
it
was
the
gerard
meantime
prayers
and
vows
rose
from
the
trembling
throng
and
to
hear
them
it
seemed
there
were
almost
as
many
gods
about
as
men
and
women
the
sailors
indeed
relied
on
a
single
goddess
they
varied
her
titles
only
calling
on
her
as
queen
of
heaven
star
of
the
sea
mistress
of
the
world
haven
of
but
among
the
landsmen
polytheism
raged
even
those
who
by
some
strange
chance
hit
on
the
same
divinity
did
not
hit
on
the
same
edition
of
that
divinity
an
english
merchant
vowed
a
heap
of
gold
to
our
lady
of
walsingham
but
a
genoese
merchant
vowed
a
silver
collar
of
four
pounds
to
our
lady
of
loretto
and
a
tuscan
noble
promised
ten
pounds
of
wax
lights
to
our
lady
of
ravenna
and
with
a
similar
rage
for
diversity
they
pledged
themselves
not
on
the
true
cross
but
on
the
true
cross
in
this
that
or
the
other
modern
city
suddenly
a
more
powerful
gust
than
usual
catching
the
sail
at
a
disadvantage
the
rotten
shrouds
gave
way
and
the
sail
was
torn
out
with
a
loud
crack
and
went
down
the
wind
smaller
and
smaller
blacker
and
blacker
and
fluttered
into
the
sea
half
a
mile
off
like
a
sheet
of
paper
and
ere
the
helmsman
could
put
the
ship
head
before
the
wind
a
wave
caught
her
on
the
quarter
and
drenched
the
poor
wretches
to
the
bone
and
gave
them
a
foretaste
of
chill
death
then
one
vowed
aloud
to
turn
carthusian
monk
if
thomas
would
save
him
another
would
go
a
pilgrim
to
compostella
bareheaded
barefooted
with
nothing
but
a
coat
of
mail
on
his
naked
skin
if
james
would
save
him
others
invoked
thomas
dominic
denys
and
above
all
catherine
of
sienna
two
petty
neapolitan
traders
stood
shivering
one
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
i
vow
to
christopher
at
paris
a
waxen
image
of
his
own
weight
if
i
win
safe
to
on
this
the
other
nudged
him
and
said
brother
brother
take
heed
what
you
vow
why
if
you
sell
all
you
have
in
the
world
by
public
auction
not
buy
his
weight
in
hold
your
tongue
you
fool
said
the
vociferator
then
in
a
whisper
think
ye
i
am
in
earnest
let
me
but
win
safe
to
land
i
not
give
him
a
rush
others
lay
flat
and
prayed
to
the
sea
oh
most
merciful
sea
oh
sea
most
generous
oh
bountiful
sea
oh
beautiful
sea
be
gentle
be
kind
preserve
us
in
this
hour
of
and
others
wailed
and
moaned
in
mere
animal
terror
each
time
the
ship
rolled
or
pitched
more
terribly
than
usual
and
she
was
now
a
mere
plaything
in
the
arms
of
the
tremendous
waves
a
roman
woman
of
the
humbler
class
sat
with
her
child
at
her
breast
silent
amid
that
wailing
throng
her
cheek
ashy
pale
her
eye
calm
and
her
lips
moved
at
times
in
silent
prayer
but
she
neither
wept
nor
lamented
nor
bargained
with
the
gods
whenever
the
ship
seemed
really
gone
under
their
feet
and
bearded
men
squeaked
she
kissed
her
child
but
that
was
all
and
so
she
sat
patient
and
suckled
him
in
death
jaws
for
why
should
he
lose
any
joy
she
could
give
him
moribundo
ay
there
i
do
believe
sat
antiquity
among
those
mediaevals
sixteen
hundred
years
had
not
tainted
the
old
roman
blood
in
her
veins
and
the
instinct
of
a
race
she
had
perhaps
scarce
heard
of
taught
her
to
die
with
decent
dignity
a
gigantic
friar
stood
on
the
poop
with
feet
apart
like
the
colossus
of
rhodes
not
so
much
defying
as
ignoring
the
peril
that
surrounded
him
he
recited
verses
from
the
canticles
with
a
loud
unwavering
voice
and
invited
the
passengers
to
confess
to
him
some
did
so
on
their
knees
and
he
heard
them
and
laid
his
hands
on
them
and
absolved
them
as
if
he
had
been
in
a
snug
sacristy
instead
of
a
perishing
ship
gerard
got
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
by
the
instinct
that
takes
the
wavering
to
the
side
of
the
impregnable
and
in
truth
the
courage
of
heroes
facing
fleshly
odds
might
have
paled
by
the
side
of
that
gigantic
friar
and
his
still
more
gigantic
composure
thus
even
here
two
were
found
who
maintained
the
dignity
of
our
race
a
woman
tender
yet
heroic
and
a
monk
steeled
by
religion
against
mortal
fears
and
now
the
sail
being
gone
the
sailors
cut
down
the
useless
mast
a
foot
above
the
board
and
it
fell
with
its
remaining
hamper
over
the
ship
side
this
seemed
to
relieve
her
a
little
but
now
the
hull
no
longer
impelled
by
canvas
could
not
keep
ahead
of
the
sea
it
struck
her
again
and
again
on
the
poop
and
the
tremendous
blows
seemed
given
by
a
rocky
mountain
not
by
a
liquid
the
captain
left
the
helm
and
came
amidships
pale
as
death
lighten
her
he
cried
fling
all
overboard
or
we
shall
founder
ere
we
strike
and
lose
the
one
little
chance
we
have
of
while
the
sailors
were
executing
this
order
the
captain
pale
himself
and
surrounded
by
pale
faces
that
demanded
to
know
their
fate
was
talking
as
unlike
an
english
skipper
in
like
peril
as
can
well
be
imagined
friends
said
he
last
night
when
all
was
fair
too
fair
alas
there
came
a
globe
of
fire
close
to
the
ship
when
a
pair
of
them
come
it
is
good
luck
and
nought
can
drown
her
that
voyage
we
mariners
call
these
fiery
globes
castor
and
pollux
but
if
castor
come
without
pollux
or
pollux
without
castor
she
is
doomed
therefore
like
good
christians
prepare
to
these
words
were
received
with
a
loud
wail
to
a
trembling
inquiry
how
long
they
had
to
prepare
the
captain
replied
she
may
or
may
not
last
half
an
hour
over
that
impossible
she
leaks
like
a
sieve
bustle
men
lighten
the
poor
passengers
seized
on
everything
that
was
on
deck
and
flung
it
overboard
presently
they
laid
hold
of
a
heavy
sack
an
old
man
was
lying
on
it
sea
sick
they
lugged
it
from
under
him
it
rattled
two
of
them
drew
it
to
the
side
up
started
the
owner
and
with
an
unearthly
shriek
pounced
on
it
holy
moses
what
would
you
do
is
my
all
the
whole
fruits
of
my
journey
silver
candlesticks
silver
plates
brooches
hanaps
let
go
thou
hoary
villain
cried
the
others
shall
all
our
lives
be
lost
for
thy
gear
fling
him
in
with
it
cried
one
is
this
ebrew
we
christian
men
are
drowned
numbers
soon
wrenched
it
from
him
and
heaved
it
over
the
side
it
splashed
into
the
waves
then
its
owner
uttered
one
cry
of
anguish
and
stood
glaring
his
white
hair
streaming
in
the
wind
and
was
going
to
leap
after
it
and
would
had
it
floated
but
it
sank
and
was
gone
for
ever
and
he
staggered
to
and
fro
tearing
his
hair
and
cursed
them
and
the
ship
and
the
sea
and
all
the
powers
of
heaven
and
hell
alike
and
now
the
captain
cried
out
see
there
is
a
church
in
sight
steer
for
that
church
mate
and
you
friends
pray
to
the
saint
he
so
they
steered
for
the
church
and
prayed
to
the
unknown
god
it
was
named
after
a
tremendous
sea
pooped
them
broke
the
rudder
and
jammed
it
immovable
and
flooded
the
deck
then
wild
with
superstitious
terror
some
of
them
came
round
gerard
here
is
the
cause
of
all
they
cried
he
has
never
invoked
a
single
saint
he
is
a
heathen
here
is
a
pagan
alas
good
friends
say
not
so
said
gerard
his
teeth
chattering
with
cold
and
fear
rather
call
these
heathens
that
lie
a
praying
to
the
sea
friends
i
do
honour
the
saints
but
i
dare
not
pray
to
them
now
there
is
no
time
oh
what
avail
me
dominic
and
thomas
and
catherine
nearer
god
throne
than
these
peter
sitteth
and
if
i
pray
to
him
it
odd
but
i
shall
be
drowned
ere
he
has
time
to
plead
my
cause
with
god
oh
oh
oh
i
must
need
go
straight
to
him
that
made
the
sea
and
the
saints
and
me
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
save
these
poor
souls
and
me
that
cry
for
the
bare
life
oh
sweet
jesus
pitiful
jesus
that
didst
walk
genezaret
when
peter
sank
and
wept
for
lazarus
dead
when
the
apostles
eyes
were
dry
oh
save
poor
gerard
for
dear
margaret
sake
at
this
moment
the
sailors
were
seen
preparing
to
desert
the
sinking
ship
in
the
little
boat
which
even
at
that
epoch
every
ship
carried
then
there
was
a
rush
of
egotists
and
thirty
souls
crowded
into
it
remained
behind
three
who
were
bewildered
and
two
who
were
paralyzed
with
terror
the
paralyzed
sat
like
heaps
of
wet
rags
the
bewildered
ones
ran
to
and
fro
and
saw
the
thirty
egotists
put
off
but
made
no
attempt
to
join
them
only
kept
running
to
and
fro
and
wringing
their
hands
besides
these
there
was
one
on
his
knees
praying
over
the
wooden
statue
of
the
virgin
mary
as
large
as
life
which
the
sailors
had
reverently
detached
from
the
mast
it
washed
about
the
deck
as
the
water
came
slushing
in
from
the
sea
and
pouring
out
at
the
scuppers
and
this
poor
soul
kept
following
it
on
his
knees
with
his
hands
clasped
at
it
and
the
water
playing
with
it
and
there
was
the
jew
palsied
but
not
by
fear
he
was
no
longer
capable
of
so
petty
a
passion
he
sat
bemoaning
his
bag
and
whenever
the
spray
lashed
him
shook
his
fist
at
where
it
came
from
and
cursed
the
nazarenes
and
their
gods
and
their
devils
and
their
ships
and
their
waters
to
all
eternity
and
the
gigantic
dominican
having
shriven
the
whole
ship
stood
calmly
communing
with
his
own
spirit
and
the
roman
woman
sat
pale
and
patient
only
drawing
her
child
closer
to
her
bosom
as
death
came
nearer
gerard
saw
this
and
it
awakened
his
manhood
see
see
he
said
they
have
the
boat
and
left
the
poor
woman
and
her
child
to
his
heart
soon
set
his
wit
working
wife
i
save
thee
yet
please
and
he
ran
to
find
a
cask
or
a
plank
to
float
her
there
was
none
then
his
eye
fell
on
the
wooden
image
of
the
virgin
he
caught
it
up
in
his
arms
and
heedless
of
a
wail
that
issued
from
its
worshipper
like
a
child
robbed
of
its
toy
ran
aft
with
it
come
wife
he
cried
i
lash
thee
and
the
child
to
this
is
sore
worm
eaten
but
she
turned
her
great
dark
eye
on
him
and
said
a
single
word
thyself
but
with
wonderful
magnanimity
and
tenderness
i
am
a
man
and
have
no
child
to
take
care
ah
said
she
and
his
words
seemed
to
animate
her
face
with
a
desire
to
live
he
lashed
the
image
to
her
side
then
with
the
hope
of
life
she
lost
something
of
her
heroic
calm
not
much
her
body
trembled
a
little
but
not
her
eye
the
ship
was
now
so
low
in
the
water
that
by
using
an
oar
as
a
lever
he
could
slide
her
into
the
waves
come
said
he
while
yet
there
is
she
turned
her
great
roman
eyes
wet
now
upon
him
poor
youth
god
forgive
me
my
child
and
he
launched
her
on
the
surge
and
with
his
oar
kept
her
from
being
battered
against
the
ship
a
heavy
hand
fell
on
him
a
deep
sonorous
voice
sounded
in
his
ear
is
well
now
come
with
it
was
the
gigantic
friar
gerard
turned
and
the
friar
took
two
strides
and
laid
hold
of
the
broken
mast
gerard
did
the
same
obeying
him
instinctively
between
them
after
a
prodigious
effort
they
hoisted
up
the
remainder
of
the
mast
and
carried
it
off
fling
it
in
said
the
friar
and
follow
they
flung
it
in
but
one
of
the
bewildered
passengers
had
run
after
them
and
jumped
first
and
got
on
one
end
gerard
seized
the
other
the
friar
the
middle
it
was
a
terrible
situation
the
mast
rose
and
plunged
with
each
wave
like
a
kicking
horse
and
the
spray
flogged
their
faces
mercilessly
and
blinded
them
to
help
knock
them
off
presently
was
heard
a
long
grating
noise
ahead
the
ship
had
struck
and
soon
after
she
being
stationary
now
they
were
hurled
against
her
with
tremendous
force
their
companion
head
struck
against
the
upper
part
of
the
broken
rudder
with
a
horrible
crack
and
was
smashed
like
a
by
a
he
sunk
directly
leaving
no
trace
but
a
red
stain
on
the
water
and
a
white
clot
on
the
jagged
rudder
and
a
death
cry
ringing
in
their
ears
as
they
drifted
clear
under
the
lee
of
the
black
hull
the
friar
uttered
a
short
latin
prayer
for
the
safety
of
his
soul
and
took
his
place
composedly
they
rolled
along
one
moment
they
saw
nothing
and
seemed
down
in
a
mere
basin
of
watery
hills
the
next
they
caught
glimpses
of
the
shore
speckled
bright
with
people
who
kept
throwing
up
their
arms
with
wild
italian
gestures
to
encourage
them
and
the
black
boat
driving
bottom
upwards
and
between
it
and
them
the
woman
rising
and
falling
like
themselves
she
had
come
across
a
paddle
and
was
holding
her
child
tight
with
her
left
arm
and
paddling
gallantly
with
her
right
when
they
had
tumbled
along
thus
a
long
time
suddenly
the
friar
said
quietly
i
touched
the
impossible
father
said
gerard
we
are
more
than
a
hundred
yards
from
shore
prithee
prithee
leave
not
our
faithful
my
son
said
the
friar
you
speak
prudently
but
know
that
i
have
business
of
holy
church
on
hand
and
may
not
waste
time
floating
when
i
can
walk
in
her
service
there
i
felt
it
with
my
toes
again
see
the
benefit
of
wearing
sandals
and
not
shoon
again
and
sandy
thy
stature
is
less
than
mine
keep
to
the
mast
i
he
left
the
mast
accordingly
and
extending
his
powerful
arms
rushed
through
the
water
gerard
soon
followed
him
at
each
overpowering
wave
the
monk
stood
like
a
tower
and
closing
his
mouth
threw
his
head
back
to
encounter
it
and
was
entirely
lost
under
it
awhile
then
emerged
and
ploughed
lustily
on
at
last
they
came
close
to
the
shore
but
the
suction
outward
baffled
all
their
attempts
to
land
then
the
natives
sent
stout
fishermen
into
the
sea
holding
by
long
spears
in
a
triple
chain
and
so
dragged
them
ashore
the
friar
shook
himself
bestowed
a
short
paternal
benediction
on
the
natives
and
went
on
to
rome
with
eyes
bent
on
earth
according
to
his
rule
and
without
pausing
he
did
not
even
cast
a
glance
back
upon
that
sea
which
had
so
nearly
engulfed
him
but
had
no
power
to
harm
him
without
his
master
leave
while
he
stalks
on
alone
to
rome
without
looking
back
i
who
am
not
in
the
service
of
holy
church
stop
a
moment
to
say
that
the
reader
and
i
were
within
six
inches
of
this
giant
once
before
but
we
escaped
him
that
time
now
i
fear
we
are
in
for
him
gerard
grasped
every
hand
upon
the
beach
they
brought
him
to
an
enormous
fire
and
with
a
delicacy
he
would
hardly
have
encountered
in
the
north
left
him
to
dry
himself
alone
on
this
he
took
out
of
his
bosom
a
parchment
and
a
paper
and
dried
them
carefully
when
this
was
done
to
his
mind
and
not
till
then
he
consented
to
put
on
a
fisherman
dress
and
leave
his
own
by
the
fire
and
went
down
to
the
beach
what
he
saw
may
be
briefly
related
the
captain
stuck
by
the
ship
not
so
much
from
gallantry
as
from
a
conviction
that
it
was
idle
to
resist
castor
or
pollux
whichever
it
was
that
had
come
for
him
in
a
ball
of
fire
nevertheless
the
sea
broke
up
the
ship
and
swept
the
poop
captain
and
all
clear
of
the
rest
and
took
him
safe
ashore
gerard
had
a
principal
hand
in
pulling
him
out
of
the
water
the
disconsolate
hebrew
landed
on
another
fragment
and
on
touching
earth
offered
a
reward
for
his
bag
which
excited
little
sympathy
but
some
amusement
two
more
were
saved
on
pieces
of
the
wreck
the
thirty
egotists
came
ashore
but
one
at
a
time
and
dead
one
breathed
still
him
the
natives
with
excellent
intentions
took
to
a
hot
fire
so
then
he
too
retired
from
this
shifting
scene
as
gerard
stood
by
the
sea
watching
with
horror
and
curiosity
mixed
his
late
companions
washed
ashore
a
hand
was
laid
lightly
on
his
shoulder
he
turned
it
was
the
roman
matron
burning
with
womanly
gratitude
she
took
his
hand
gently
and
raising
it
slowly
to
her
lips
kissed
it
but
so
nobly
she
seemed
to
be
conferring
an
honour
on
one
deserving
hand
then
with
face
all
beaming
and
moist
eyes
she
held
her
child
up
and
made
him
kiss
his
preserver
gerard
kissed
the
child
more
than
once
he
was
fond
of
children
but
he
said
nothing
he
was
much
moved
for
she
did
not
speak
at
all
except
with
her
eyes
and
glowing
cheeks
and
noble
antique
gesture
so
large
and
stately
perhaps
she
was
right
gratitude
is
not
a
thing
of
words
it
was
an
ancient
roman
matron
thanking
a
modern
from
her
heart
of
hearts
next
day
towards
afternoon
gerard
twice
as
old
as
last
year
thrice
as
learned
in
human
ways
a
boy
no
more
but
a
man
who
had
shed
blood
in
and
grazed
the
grave
by
land
and
sea
reached
the
eternal
city
post

chapter
lvi
gerard
took
a
modest
lodging
on
the
west
bank
of
the
tiber
and
every
day
went
forth
in
search
of
work
taking
a
specimen
round
to
every
shop
he
could
hear
of
that
executed
such
commissions
they
received
him
coldly
we
make
our
letter
somewhat
thinner
than
this
said
one
how
dark
your
ink
is
said
another
but
the
main
cry
was
what
avails
this
scant
is
the
latin
writ
here
now
can
ye
not
write
greek
ay
but
not
nigh
so
well
as
then
you
shall
never
make
your
bread
at
gerard
borrowed
a
beautiful
greek
manuscript
at
a
high
price
and
went
home
with
a
sad
hole
in
his
purse
but
none
in
his
courage
in
a
fortnight
he
had
made
vast
progress
with
the
greek
character
so
then
to
lose
no
time
he
used
to
work
at
it
till
noon
and
hunt
customers
the
rest
of
the
day
when
he
carried
round
a
better
greek
specimen
than
any
they
possessed
the
traders
informed
him
that
greek
and
latin
were
alike
unsaleable
the
city
was
thronged
with
works
from
all
europe
he
should
have
come
last
year
gerard
bought
a
psaltery
his
landlady
pleased
with
his
looks
and
manners
used
often
to
speak
a
kind
word
in
passing
one
day
she
made
him
dine
with
her
and
somewhat
to
his
surprise
asked
him
what
had
dashed
his
spirits
he
told
her
she
gave
him
her
reading
of
the
matter
those
sly
traders
she
would
be
bound
had
writers
in
their
pay
for
whose
work
they
received
a
noble
price
and
paid
a
sorry
one
so
no
wonder
they
blow
cold
on
you
methinks
you
write
too
well
how
know
i
that
say
you
marry
marry
because
you
lock
not
your
door
like
the
churl
pietro
and
women
will
be
curious
ay
ay
you
write
too
well
for
gerard
asked
an
explanation
why
said
she
your
good
work
might
put
out
the
eyes
of
that
they
are
gerard
sighed
alas
dame
you
read
folk
on
the
ill
side
and
you
so
kind
and
frank
my
dear
little
heart
these
romans
are
a
subtle
race
me
i
am
a
siennese
thanks
to
the
my
mistake
was
leaving
augsburg
said
gerard
augsburg
said
she
haughtily
is
that
a
place
to
even
to
rome
i
never
heard
of
it
for
my
she
then
assured
him
that
he
should
make
his
fortune
in
spite
of
the
booksellers
seeing
thee
a
stranger
they
lie
to
thee
without
sense
or
discretion
why
all
the
world
knows
that
our
great
folk
are
bitten
with
the
writing
spider
this
many
years
and
pour
out
their
money
like
water
and
turn
good
land
and
houses
into
writ
sheepskins
to
keep
in
a
chest
or
a
cupboard
god
help
them
and
send
them
safe
through
this
fury
as
he
hath
through
a
heap
of
others
and
in
sooth
hath
been
somewhat
less
cutting
and
stabbing
among
rival
factions
and
vindictive
eating
of
their
opposites
livers
minced
and
fried
since
scribbling
came
in
why
i
can
tell
you
two
there
is
his
eminence
cardinal
bassarion
and
his
holiness
the
pope
himself
there
be
a
pair
could
keep
a
score
such
as
thee
a
writing
night
and
day
but
i
speak
to
teresa
she
hears
the
gossip
of
the
the
next
day
she
told
him
she
had
seen
teresa
and
had
heard
of
five
more
signors
who
were
bitten
with
the
writing
spider
gerard
took
down
their
names
and
bought
parchment
and
busied
himself
for
some
days
in
preparing
specimens
he
left
one
with
his
name
and
address
at
each
of
these
signors
doors
and
hopefully
awaited
the
result
there
was
none
day
after
day
passed
and
left
him
heartsick
and
strange
to
say
this
was
just
the
time
when
margaret
was
fighting
so
hard
against
odds
to
feed
her
male
dependents
at
rotterdam
and
arrested
for
curing
without
a
licence
instead
of
killing
with
one
gerard
saw
ruin
staring
him
in
the
face
he
spent
the
afternoons
picking
up
canzonets
and
mastering
them
he
laid
in
playing
cards
to
colour
and
struck
off
a
meal
per
day
this
last
stroke
of
genius
got
him
into
fresh
trouble
in
these
camere
locande
the
landlady
dressed
all
the
meals
though
the
lodgers
bought
the
provisions
so
gerard
hostess
speedily
detected
him
and
asked
him
if
he
was
not
ashamed
himself
by
which
brusque
opening
having
made
him
blush
and
look
scared
she
pacified
herself
all
in
a
moment
and
appealed
to
his
good
sense
whether
adversity
was
a
thing
to
be
overcome
on
an
empty
stomach
patienza
my
lad
times
will
mend
meantime
i
will
feed
you
for
the
love
of
italian
for
nay
hostess
said
gerard
my
purse
is
not
yet
quite
void
and
it
would
add
to
my
trouble
an
if
true
folk
should
lose
their
due
by
why
you
are
as
mad
as
your
neighbour
pietro
with
his
one
bad
why
how
know
you
is
a
bad
picture
because
nobody
will
buy
it
there
is
one
that
hath
no
gift
he
will
have
to
don
casque
and
glaive
and
carry
his
panel
for
a
gerard
pricked
up
his
ears
at
this
so
she
told
him
more
pietro
had
come
from
florence
with
money
in
his
purse
and
an
unfinished
picture
had
taken
her
one
unfurnished
room
opposite
gerard
and
furnished
it
neatly
when
his
picture
was
finished
he
received
visitors
and
had
offers
for
it
though
in
her
opinion
liberal
ones
he
had
refused
so
disdainfully
as
to
make
enemies
of
his
customers
since
then
he
had
often
taken
it
out
with
him
to
try
and
sell
but
had
always
brought
it
back
and
the
last
month
she
had
seen
one
movable
after
another
go
out
of
his
room
and
now
he
wore
but
one
suit
and
lay
at
night
on
a
great
chest
she
had
found
this
out
only
by
peeping
through
the
keyhole
for
he
locked
the
door
most
vigilantly
whenever
he
went
out
is
he
afraid
we
shall
steal
his
chest
or
his
picture
that
no
soul
in
all
rome
is
weak
enough
to
buy
nay
sweet
hostess
see
you
not
is
his
poverty
he
would
screen
from
view
and
the
more
fool
he
are
all
our
hearts
as
ill
as
his
a
might
give
us
a
trial
first
how
you
speak
of
him
why
his
case
is
mine
and
your
countryman
to
oh
we
siennese
love
strangers
his
case
yours
nay
is
just
the
contrary
you
are
the
comeliest
youth
ever
lodged
in
this
house
hair
like
gold
he
is
a
dark
loon
besides
you
know
how
to
take
a
woman
on
her
better
side
but
not
he
natheless
i
wish
he
would
not
starve
to
death
in
my
house
to
get
me
a
bad
name
anyway
one
starveling
is
enough
in
any
house
you
are
far
from
home
and
it
is
for
me
which
am
the
mistress
here
to
number
your
meals
for
me
and
the
dutch
wife
your
mother
that
is
far
away
we
two
women
shall
settle
that
matter
mind
thou
thine
own
business
being
a
man
and
leave
cooking
and
the
like
to
us
that
are
in
the
world
for
little
else
that
i
see
but
to
roast
fowls
and
suckle
men
at
starting
and
sweep
their
grownup
dear
kind
dame
in
sooth
you
do
often
put
me
in
mind
of
my
mother
that
is
far
all
the
better
i
put
you
more
in
mind
of
her
before
i
have
done
with
and
the
honest
soul
beamed
with
pleasure
gerard
not
being
an
egotist
nor
blinded
by
female
partialities
saw
his
own
grief
in
poor
proud
pietro
and
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
he
resolved
to
share
his
humble
means
with
that
unlucky
artist
sympathy
would
repay
him
he
tried
to
waylay
him
but
without
success
one
day
he
heard
a
groaning
in
the
room
he
knocked
at
the
door
but
received
no
answer
he
knocked
again
a
surly
voice
bade
him
enter
he
obeyed
somewhat
timidly
and
entered
a
garret
furnished
with
a
chair
a
picture
face
to
wall
an
iron
basin
an
easel
and
a
long
chest
on
which
was
coiled
a
haggard
young
man
with
a
wonderfully
bright
eye
anything
more
like
a
coiled
cobra
ripe
for
striking
the
first
comer
was
never
seen
good
signor
pietro
said
gerard
forgive
me
that
weary
of
my
own
solitude
i
intrude
on
yours
but
i
am
your
nighest
neighbour
in
this
house
and
methinks
your
brother
in
fortune
i
am
an
artist
you
are
a
painter
welcome
signer
sit
down
on
my
and
pietro
jumped
off
and
waved
him
into
the
vacant
throne
with
a
magnificent
demonstration
of
courtesy
gerard
bowed
and
smiled
but
hesitated
a
little
i
may
not
call
myself
a
painter
i
am
a
writer
a
caligraph
i
copy
greek
and
latin
manuscripts
when
i
can
get
them
to
and
you
call
that
an
artist
without
offence
to
your
superior
merit
signor
no
offence
stranger
none
only
meseemeth
an
artist
is
one
who
thinks
and
paints
his
thought
now
a
caligraph
but
draws
in
black
and
white
the
thoughts
of
is
well
distinguished
signor
but
then
a
writer
can
write
the
thoughts
of
the
great
ancients
and
matters
of
pure
reason
such
as
no
man
may
paint
ay
and
the
thoughts
of
god
which
angels
could
not
paint
but
let
that
pass
i
am
a
painter
as
well
but
a
sorry
the
better
thy
luck
will
buy
thy
work
in
but
seeking
to
commend
myself
to
one
of
thy
eminence
i
thought
it
well
rather
to
call
myself
a
capable
writer
than
a
scurvy
at
this
moment
a
step
was
heard
on
the
stair
ah
is
the
good
dame
cried
gerard
what
oh
hostess
i
am
here
in
conversation
with
signor
pietro
i
dare
say
he
will
let
me
have
my
humble
dinner
the
italian
bowed
gravely
the
landlady
brought
in
gerard
dinner
smoking
and
savoury
she
put
the
dish
down
on
the
bed
with
a
face
divested
of
all
expression
and
went
gerard
fell
to
but
ere
he
had
eaten
many
mouthfuls
he
stopped
and
said
i
am
an
churl
signor
pietro
i
eat
to
my
mind
when
i
eat
alone
for
our
lady
sake
put
a
spoon
into
this
ragout
with
me
is
not
unsavoury
i
promise
pietro
fixed
his
glittering
eye
on
him
what
good
youth
thou
a
stranger
and
offerest
me
thy
dinner
why
see
there
is
more
than
one
can
well
i
accept
said
pietro
and
took
the
dish
with
some
appearance
of
calmness
and
flung
the
contents
out
of
window
then
he
turned
trembling
with
mortification
and
ire
and
said
let
that
teach
thee
to
offer
alms
to
an
artist
thou
knowest
not
master
gerard
face
flushed
with
anger
and
it
cost
him
a
bitter
struggle
not
to
box
this
creature
ears
and
then
to
go
and
destroy
good
food
his
mother
milk
curdled
in
his
veins
with
horror
at
such
impiety
finally
pity
at
pietro
petulance
and
egotism
and
a
touch
of
respect
for
pride
prevailed
however
he
said
coldly
likely
what
thou
hast
done
might
pass
in
a
novel
of
thy
countryman
signor
boccaccio
but
was
not
make
that
good
said
the
painter
sullenly
i
offered
thee
half
my
dinner
no
more
but
thou
hast
it
all
hadst
a
right
to
throw
away
thy
share
but
not
mine
pride
is
well
but
justice
is
pietro
stared
then
reflected
is
well
i
took
thee
for
a
fool
so
transparent
was
thine
artifice
forgive
me
and
prithee
leave
me
thou
seest
how
is
with
me
the
world
hath
soured
me
i
hate
mankind
i
was
not
always
so
once
more
excuse
that
my
discourtesy
and
fare
thee
gerard
sighed
and
made
for
the
door
but
suddenly
a
thought
struck
him
signor
pietro
said
he
we
dutchmen
are
hard
bargainers
we
are
the
lads
eij
scheeren
that
is
shave
an
egg
therefore
i
for
my
lost
dinner
do
claim
to
feast
mine
eyes
on
your
picture
whose
face
is
toward
the
nay
nay
said
the
painter
hastily
ask
me
not
that
i
have
already
misconducted
myself
enough
towards
thee
i
would
not
shed
thy
saints
forbid
my
blood
stranger
said
pietro
sullenly
irritated
by
repeated
insults
to
my
picture
which
is
my
child
my
heart
i
did
in
a
moment
of
rage
make
a
solemn
vow
to
drive
my
dagger
into
the
next
one
that
should
flout
it
and
the
labour
and
love
that
i
have
given
to
what
are
all
to
be
slain
that
will
not
praise
this
picture
and
he
looked
at
its
back
with
curiosity
nay
nay
if
you
would
but
look
at
it
and
hold
your
parrot
tongues
but
you
will
be
talking
so
i
have
turned
it
to
the
wall
for
ever
would
i
were
dead
and
buried
in
it
for
my
coffin
gerard
reflected
i
accept
the
condition
show
me
the
picture
i
can
but
hold
my
pietro
went
and
turned
its
face
and
put
it
in
the
best
light
the
room
afforded
and
coiled
himself
again
on
his
chest
with
his
eye
and
stiletto
glittering
the
picture
represented
the
virgin
and
christ
flying
through
the
air
in
a
sort
of
cloud
of
shadowy
cherubic
faces
underneath
was
a
landscape
forty
or
fifty
miles
in
extent
and
a
purple
sky
above
gerard
stood
and
looked
at
it
in
silence
then
he
stepped
close
and
looked
then
he
retired
as
far
off
as
he
could
and
looked
but
said
not
a
word
when
he
had
been
at
this
game
half
an
hour
pietro
cried
out
querulously
and
somewhat
inconsistently
well
have
you
not
a
word
to
say
about
it
gerard
started
i
cry
your
mercy
i
forgot
there
were
three
of
us
here
ay
i
have
much
to
and
he
drew
his
sword
alas
alas
cried
pietro
jumping
in
terror
from
his
lair
what
wouldst
thou
marry
defend
myself
against
thy
bodkin
signor
and
at
due
odds
being
as
aforesaid
a
dutchman
therefore
hold
aloof
while
i
deliver
judgment
or
i
will
pin
thee
to
the
wall
like
a
oh
is
that
all
said
pietro
greatly
relieved
i
feared
you
were
going
to
stab
my
poor
picture
with
your
sword
stabbed
already
by
so
many
foul
gerard
pursued
criticism
under
put
himself
in
a
position
of
defence
with
his
sword
point
covering
pietro
and
one
eye
glancing
aside
at
the
picture
first
signor
i
would
have
you
know
that
in
the
mixing
of
certain
colours
and
in
the
preparation
of
your
oil
you
italians
are
far
behind
us
flemings
but
let
that
flea
stick
for
as
small
as
i
am
i
can
show
you
certain
secrets
of
the
van
eycks
that
you
will
put
to
marvellous
profit
in
your
next
picture
meantime
i
see
in
this
one
the
great
qualities
of
your
nation
verily
ye
are
solis
filii
if
we
have
colour
you
have
imagination
mother
of
heaven
an
he
hath
not
flung
his
immortal
soul
upon
the
panel
one
thing
i
go
by
is
this
it
makes
other
pictures
i
once
admired
seem
drossy
things
the
drapery
here
is
somewhat
short
and
stiff
why
not
let
it
float
freely
the
figures
being
in
air
and
motion
i
will
i
will
cried
pietro
eagerly
i
will
do
anything
for
those
who
will
but
see
what
i
have
humph
this
landscape
it
enlightens
me
henceforth
i
scorn
those
little
huddled
landscapes
that
did
erst
content
me
here
is
nature
very
face
a
spacious
plain
each
distance
marked
and
every
tree
house
figure
field
and
river
smaller
and
less
plain
by
exquisite
gradation
till
vision
itself
melts
into
distance
o
beautiful
and
the
cunning
rogue
hath
hung
his
celestial
figure
in
air
out
of
the
way
of
his
little
world
below
here
floating
saints
beneath
heaven
purple
canopy
there
far
down
earth
and
her
busy
hives
and
they
let
you
take
this
painted
poetry
this
blooming
hymn
through
the
streets
of
rome
and
bring
it
home
unsold
but
i
tell
thee
in
ghent
or
bruges
or
even
in
rotterdam
they
would
tear
it
out
of
thy
hands
but
it
is
a
common
saying
that
a
stranger
eye
sees
clearest
courage
pietro
vanucci
i
reverence
thee
and
though
myself
a
scurvy
painter
do
forgive
thee
for
being
a
great
one
forgive
thee
i
thank
god
for
thee
and
such
rare
men
as
thou
art
and
bow
the
knee
to
thee
in
just
homage
thy
picture
is
immortal
and
thou
that
hast
but
a
chest
to
sit
on
art
a
king
in
thy
most
royal
art
viva
il
maestro
viva
at
this
unexpected
burst
the
painter
with
all
the
abandon
of
his
nation
flung
himself
on
gerard
neck
they
said
it
was
a
dream
he
sobbed
maniacs
themselves
no
idiots
shouted
gerard
generous
stranger
i
will
hate
men
no
more
since
the
world
hath
such
as
thee
i
was
a
viper
to
fling
thy
poor
dinner
away
a
wretch
a
well
monster
wilt
be
gentle
now
and
sup
with
me
ah
that
i
will
whither
goest
thou
to
order
supper
on
the
instant
we
will
have
the
picture
for
third
i
will
invite
it
whiles
thou
art
gone
my
poor
picture
child
of
my
ah
master
look
on
many
a
supper
after
the
worms
have
eaten
you
and
i
hope
so
said
pietro
chapter
lvii
about
a
week
after
this
the
two
friends
sat
working
together
but
not
in
the
same
spirit
pietro
dashed
fitfully
at
his
and
did
wonders
in
a
few
minutes
and
then
did
nothing
except
abuse
it
then
presently
resumed
it
in
a
fury
to
lay
it
down
with
a
groan
through
all
which
kept
calmly
working
calmly
smiling
the
canny
dutchman
to
be
plain
gerard
who
never
had
a
friend
he
did
not
master
had
put
his
onagra
in
harness
the
friends
were
painting
playing
cards
to
boil
the
pot
when
done
the
indignant
master
took
up
his
picture
to
make
his
daily
tour
in
search
of
a
customer
gerard
begged
him
to
take
the
cards
as
well
and
try
and
sell
them
he
looked
all
the
but
eventually
embraced
gerard
in
the
italian
fashion
and
took
them
after
first
drying
the
ones
in
the
sun
which
was
now
powerful
in
that
happy
clime
gerard
left
alone
executed
a
greek
letter
or
two
and
then
mended
a
little
rent
in
his
hose
his
landlady
found
him
thus
employed
and
inquired
ironically
whether
there
were
no
women
in
the
house
when
you
have
done
that
said
she
come
and
talk
to
teresa
my
friend
i
spoke
to
thee
of
that
hath
a
husband
not
good
for
much
which
brags
his
acquaintance
with
the
gerard
went
down
and
who
should
teresa
be
but
the
roman
matron
ah
madama
said
he
is
it
you
the
good
dame
told
me
not
that
and
the
little
boy
is
he
well
is
he
none
the
worse
for
his
voyage
in
that
strange
boat
he
is
well
said
the
matron
why
what
are
you
two
talking
about
said
the
landlady
staring
at
them
both
in
turn
and
why
tremble
you
so
teresa
mia
he
saved
my
child
life
said
teresa
making
an
effort
to
compose
herself
what
my
lodger
and
he
never
told
me
a
word
of
that
art
not
ashamed
to
look
me
in
the
face
alas
speak
not
harshly
to
him
said
the
matron
she
then
turned
to
her
friend
and
poured
out
a
glowing
description
of
gerard
conduct
during
which
gerard
stood
blushing
like
a
girl
and
scarce
recognizing
his
own
performance
gratitude
painted
it
so
fair
and
to
think
thou
shouldst
ask
me
to
serve
thy
lodger
of
whom
i
knew
nought
but
that
he
had
thy
good
word
oh
fiammina
and
that
was
enough
for
me
dear
youth
in
serving
thee
i
serve
then
ensued
an
eager
description
by
the
two
women
of
what
had
been
done
and
what
should
be
done
to
penetrate
the
thick
wall
of
fees
commissions
and
chicanery
which
stood
between
the
patrons
of
art
and
an
unknown
artist
in
the
eternal
city
teresa
smiled
sadly
at
gerard
simplicity
in
leaving
specimens
of
his
skill
at
the
doors
of
the
great
what
said
she
without
promising
the
servants
a
share
without
even
feeing
them
to
let
the
signors
see
thy
merchandise
as
well
have
flung
it
into
sighed
gerard
then
how
is
an
artist
to
find
a
patron
for
artists
are
poor
not
by
going
to
some
city
nobler
and
not
so
greedy
as
this
said
teresa
la
corte
romana
non
vuol
pecora
senza
she
fell
into
thought
and
said
she
would
come
again
the
landlady
felicitated
gerard
teresa
has
got
something
in
her
head
said
she
teresa
was
scarce
gone
when
pietro
returned
with
his
picture
looking
black
as
thunder
gerard
exchanged
a
glance
with
the
landlady
and
followed
him
upstairs
to
console
him
what
have
they
let
thee
bring
home
thy
masterpiece
as
more
fools
they
that
is
not
the
why
what
is
the
matter
they
have
bought
the
cards
yelled
pietro
and
hammered
the
air
furiously
right
and
left
all
the
better
said
gerard
cheerfully
they
flew
at
me
for
them
they
were
enraptured
with
them
they
tried
to
conceal
their
longing
for
them
but
could
not
i
saw
i
feigned
i
pillaged
curse
the
and
he
flung
down
a
dozen
small
silver
coins
on
the
floor
and
jumped
on
them
and
danced
on
them
with
basilisk
eyes
and
then
kicked
them
assiduously
and
sent
them
spinning
and
flying
and
running
all
abroad
down
went
gerard
on
his
knees
and
followed
the
maltreated
innocents
directly
and
transferred
them
tenderly
to
his
purse
shouldst
rather
smile
at
their
ignorance
and
put
it
to
profit
said
he
and
so
i
will
said
pietro
with
concentrated
indignation
the
brutes
we
will
paint
a
pack
a
day
we
will
set
the
whole
city
gambling
and
ruining
itself
while
we
live
like
princes
on
its
vices
and
stupidity
there
was
one
of
the
queens
though
i
had
fain
have
kept
back
was
you
limned
her
brother
she
had
lovely
hair
and
sapphire
eyes
and
above
all
pietro
said
gerard
softly
i
painted
that
one
from
my
the
italian
nodded
and
his
eyes
twinkled
you
love
her
so
well
yet
leave
pietro
it
is
because
i
love
her
so
dear
that
i
have
wandered
all
this
weary
this
interesting
colloquy
was
interrupted
by
the
landlady
crying
from
below
come
down
you
are
he
went
down
and
there
was
teresa
again
come
with
me
ser
chapter
lviii
gerard
walked
silently
beside
teresa
wondering
in
his
own
mind
after
the
manner
of
artists
what
she
was
going
to
do
with
him
instead
of
asking
her
so
at
last
she
told
him
of
her
own
accord
a
friend
had
informed
her
of
a
working
goldsmith
wife
who
wanted
a
writer
her
shop
is
hard
by
you
will
not
have
far
to
accordingly
they
soon
arrived
at
the
goldsmith
wife
madama
said
teresa
leonora
tells
me
you
want
a
writer
i
have
brought
you
a
beautiful
one
he
saved
my
child
at
sea
prithee
look
on
him
with
the
goldsmith
wife
complied
in
one
sense
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
gerard
comely
face
and
could
hardly
take
them
off
again
but
her
reply
was
unsatisfactory
nay
i
have
no
use
for
a
writer
ah
i
mind
now
it
is
my
gossip
claelia
the
wants
one
she
told
me
and
i
told
teresa
made
a
courteous
speech
and
withdrew
claelia
lived
at
some
distance
and
when
they
reached
her
house
she
was
out
teresa
said
calmly
i
will
await
her
return
and
sat
so
still
and
dignified
and
statuesque
that
gerard
was
beginning
furtively
to
draw
her
when
claelia
returned
madama
i
hear
from
the
goldsmith
wife
the
excellent
olympia
that
you
need
a
writer
here
she
took
gerard
by
the
hand
and
led
him
forward
i
have
brought
you
a
beautiful
one
he
saved
my
child
from
the
cruel
waves
for
our
lady
sake
look
with
favour
on
my
good
dame
my
fair
ser
said
claelia
i
have
no
use
for
a
writer
but
now
you
remind
me
it
was
my
friend
appia
claudia
asked
me
for
one
but
the
other
day
she
is
a
tailor
lives
in
the
via
teresa
retired
calmly
madama
said
gerard
this
is
likely
to
be
a
tedious
business
for
teresa
opened
her
eyes
what
was
ever
done
without
a
little
patience
she
added
mildly
we
will
knock
at
every
door
at
rome
but
you
shall
have
but
madama
i
think
we
are
dogged
i
noticed
a
man
that
follows
us
sometimes
afar
sometimes
i
have
seen
it
said
teresa
coldly
but
her
cheek
coloured
faintly
it
is
my
poor
she
stopped
and
turned
and
beckoned
with
her
finger
a
figure
approached
them
somewhat
unwillingly
when
he
came
up
she
gazed
him
full
in
the
face
and
he
looked
sheepish
lodovico
mio
said
she
know
this
young
ser
of
whom
i
have
so
often
spoken
to
thee
know
him
and
love
him
for
he
it
was
who
saved
thy
wife
and
at
these
last
words
lodovico
who
had
been
bowing
and
grinning
artificially
suddenly
changed
to
an
expression
of
heartfelt
gratitude
and
embraced
gerard
warmly
yet
somehow
there
was
something
in
the
man
original
manner
and
his
having
followed
his
wife
by
stealth
that
made
gerard
uncomfortable
under
this
caress
however
he
said
we
shall
have
your
company
ser
lodovico
no
signor
replied
lodovico
i
go
not
on
that
side
addio
then
said
teresa
significantly
when
shall
you
return
home
teresa
mia
when
i
have
done
mine
errand
they
pursued
their
way
in
silence
teresa
now
wore
a
sad
and
almost
gloomy
air
to
be
brief
appia
claudia
was
merciful
and
did
not
send
them
over
tiber
again
but
only
a
hundred
yards
down
the
street
to
lucretia
who
kept
the
glove
shop
she
it
was
wanted
a
writer
but
what
for
appia
claudia
could
not
conceive
lucretia
was
a
merry
little
dame
who
received
them
heartily
enough
and
told
them
she
wanted
no
writer
kept
all
her
accounts
in
her
head
it
was
for
my
confessor
father
colonna
he
is
mad
after
i
have
heard
of
his
excellency
said
teresa
who
has
not
but
good
dame
he
is
a
friar
he
has
made
vow
of
poverty
i
can
not
let
the
young
man
write
and
not
be
paid
he
saved
my
child
at
sea
did
he
now
and
lucretia
cast
an
approving
look
on
gerard
well
make
your
mind
easy
a
colonna
never
wants
for
money
the
good
father
has
only
to
say
the
word
and
the
princes
of
his
race
will
pour
a
thousand
crowns
into
his
lap
and
such
a
confessor
dame
the
best
in
rome
his
head
is
leagues
and
leagues
away
all
the
while
he
never
heeds
what
you
are
saying
why
i
think
no
more
of
confessing
my
sins
to
him
than
of
telling
them
to
that
wall
once
to
try
him
i
confessed
along
with
the
rest
as
how
i
had
killed
my
lodger
little
girl
and
baked
her
in
a
pie
well
when
my
voice
left
off
confessing
he
started
out
of
his
dream
and
says
he
a
mustering
up
a
gloom
erring
sister
say
three
paternosters
and
three
ave
marias
kneeling
and
eat
no
butter
nor
eggs
next
wednesday
and
pax
vobiscum
and
off
a
went
with
his
hands
behind
him
looking
as
if
there
was
no
such
thing
as
me
in
the
teresa
waited
patiently
then
calmly
brought
this
discursive
lady
back
to
the
point
would
she
be
so
kind
as
go
with
this
good
youth
to
the
friar
and
speak
for
him
alack
how
can
i
leave
my
shop
and
what
need
his
door
is
aye
open
to
writers
and
painters
and
scholars
and
all
such
cattle
why
one
day
he
would
not
receive
the
duke
because
a
learned
greek
was
closeted
with
him
and
the
friar
head
and
his
so
close
together
over
a
dusty
parchment
just
come
in
from
greece
as
you
could
put
one
cowl
over
the
pair
his
wench
onesta
told
me
she
mostly
looks
in
here
for
a
chat
when
she
goes
an
this
is
the
man
for
thee
my
friend
said
teresa
all
you
have
to
do
continued
lucretia
is
to
go
to
his
lodgings
my
boy
shall
show
them
you
and
tell
onesta
you
come
from
me
and
you
are
a
writer
and
she
will
take
you
up
to
him
if
you
put
a
piece
of
silver
in
the
wench
hand
do
you
no
harm
that
stands
to
i
have
silver
said
teresa
warmly
but
stay
said
lucretia
mind
one
thing
what
the
young
man
saith
he
can
do
that
he
must
be
able
to
do
or
let
him
shun
the
good
friar
like
poison
he
is
a
very
wild
beast
against
all
bunglers
why
was
but
day
one
brought
him
an
crucifix
says
he
this
how
you
present
salvator
mundi
who
died
for
you
in
mortal
agony
and
you
go
and
grudge
him
careful
work
this
slovenly
gimcrack
a
crucifix
but
that
it
is
a
crucifix
of
some
sort
and
i
am
a
holy
man
i
dust
your
jacket
with
your
crucifix
says
he
onesta
heard
every
word
through
the
so
have
no
fears
madama
said
teresa
loftily
i
will
answer
for
his
ability
he
saved
my
gerard
was
not
subtle
enough
to
appreciate
this
conclusion
and
was
so
far
from
sharing
teresa
confidence
that
he
begged
a
respite
he
would
rather
not
go
to
the
friar
would
not
do
as
well
here
is
a
coward
for
ye
said
lucretia
no
he
is
not
a
coward
said
teresa
firing
up
he
is
i
am
afraid
of
this
fastidious
friar
said
gerard
consider
he
has
seen
the
handiwork
of
all
the
writers
in
italy
dear
dame
teresa
if
you
would
but
let
me
prepare
a
better
piece
of
work
than
yet
i
have
done
and
then
i
will
face
him
with
i
consent
said
teresa
they
walked
home
together
not
far
from
his
own
lodging
was
a
shop
that
sold
vellum
there
was
a
beautiful
white
skin
in
the
window
gerard
looked
at
it
wistfully
but
he
knew
he
could
not
pay
for
it
so
he
went
on
rather
hastily
however
he
soon
made
up
his
mind
where
to
get
vellum
and
parting
with
teresa
at
his
own
door
ran
hastily
upstairs
and
took
the
bond
he
had
brought
all
the
way
from
sevenbergen
and
laid
it
with
a
sigh
on
the
table
he
then
prepared
with
his
chemicals
to
erase
the
old
writing
but
as
this
was
his
last
chance
of
reading
it
he
now
overcame
his
deadly
repugnance
to
bad
writing
and
proceeded
to
decipher
the
deed
in
spite
of
its
detestable
contractions
it
appeared
by
this
deed
that
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
was
to
advance
some
money
to
floris
brandt
on
a
piece
of
land
and
was
to
repay
himself
out
of
the
rent
on
this
gerard
felt
it
would
be
imprudent
and
improper
to
destroy
the
deed
on
the
contrary
he
vowed
to
decipher
every
word
at
his
leisure
he
went
downstairs
determined
to
buy
a
small
piece
of
vellum
with
his
half
of
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
he
found
the
landlady
and
teresa
talking
at
sight
of
him
the
former
cried
here
he
is
you
are
caught
donna
mia
see
what
she
has
bought
you
and
whipped
out
from
under
her
apron
the
very
skin
of
vellum
gerard
had
longed
for
why
dame
why
donna
teresa
and
he
was
speechless
with
pleasure
and
astonishment
dear
donna
teresa
there
is
not
a
skin
in
all
rome
like
it
however
came
you
to
hit
on
this
one
is
alas
dear
boy
did
not
thine
eye
rest
on
it
with
desire
and
didst
thou
not
sigh
in
turning
away
from
it
and
was
it
for
teresa
to
let
thee
want
the
thing
after
that
what
sagacity
what
goodness
madama
oh
dame
i
never
thought
i
should
possess
this
what
did
you
pay
for
it
i
forget
addio
fiammina
addio
ser
gerard
be
happy
be
prosperous
as
you
are
and
the
roman
matron
glided
away
while
gerard
was
hesitating
and
thinking
how
to
offer
to
pay
so
stately
a
creature
for
her
purchase
the
next
day
in
the
afternoon
he
went
to
lucretia
and
her
boy
took
him
to
fra
colonna
lodgings
he
announced
his
business
and
feed
onesta
and
she
took
him
up
to
the
friar
gerard
entered
with
a
beating
heart
the
room
a
large
one
was
strewed
and
heaped
with
objects
of
art
antiquity
and
learning
lying
about
in
rich
profusion
and
confusion
manuscripts
pictures
carvings
in
wood
and
ivory
musical
instruments
and
in
this
glorious
chaos
sat
the
friar
poring
intently
over
an
arabian
manuscript
he
looked
up
a
little
peevishly
at
the
interruption
onesta
whispered
in
his
ear
very
well
said
he
let
him
be
seated
stay
young
man
show
me
how
you
write
and
he
threw
gerard
a
piece
of
paper
and
pointed
to
an
inkhorn
so
please
you
reverend
father
said
gerard
my
hand
it
trembleth
too
much
at
this
moment
but
last
night
i
wrote
a
vellum
page
of
greek
and
the
latin
version
by
its
side
to
show
the
various
show
it
me
gerard
brought
the
work
to
him
in
fear
and
trembling
then
stood
awaiting
his
verdict
when
it
came
it
staggered
him
for
the
verdict
was
a
dominican
falling
on
his
neck
the
next
day
an
event
took
place
in
holland
the
effect
of
which
on
gerard
destiny
no
mortal
at
the
time
nor
even
my
intelligent
reader
now
could
i
think
foresee
marched
up
to
eli
door
a
pageant
brave
to
the
eye
of
sense
and
to
the
vulgar
judgment
noble
but
to
the
philosophic
pitiable
more
or
less
it
looked
one
animal
a
centaur
but
on
severe
analysis
proved
two
the
human
half
were
sadly
bedizened
with
those
two
metals
to
clothe
his
carcass
with
which
and
line
his
pouch
man
has
now
and
then
disposed
of
his
soul
still
the
horse
was
the
vainer
brute
of
the
two
he
was
far
worse
beflounced
bebonneted
and
bemantled
than
any
fair
lady
regnante
crinolina
for
the
man
under
the
colour
of
a
retained
nature
outline
but
it
was
subaudi
equum
scarce
a
pennyweight
of
honest
to
be
seen
our
crinoline
spares
the
noble
parts
of
women
and
makes
but
the
baser
parts
gigantic
why
this
preference
but
this
poor
animal
from
stem
to
stern
was
swamped
in
finery
his
ears
were
hid
in
great
sheaths
of
white
linen
tipped
with
silver
and
blue
his
body
swaddled
in
stiff
gorgeous
cloths
descending
to
the
ground
except
just
in
front
where
they
left
him
room
to
mince
his
tail
though
dear
to
memory
no
doubt
was
lost
to
sight
being
tucked
in
heaven
knows
how
only
his
eyes
shone
out
like
goggles
through
two
holes
pierced
in
the
wall
of
haberdashery
and
his
little
front
hoofs
peeped
in
and
out
like
rats
yet
did
this
compound
gorgeous
and
irrational
represent
power
absolute
power
it
came
straight
from
a
tournament
at
the
duke
court
which
being
on
a
progress
lay
last
night
at
a
neighbouring
town
to
execute
the
behests
of
royalty
what
ho
cried
the
upper
half
and
on
eli
emerging
with
his
wife
behind
him
saluted
them
peace
be
with
you
good
people
rejoice
i
am
come
for
your
eli
looked
amazed
and
said
nothing
but
catherine
screamed
over
his
shoulder
you
have
mistook
your
road
good
man
here
abides
no
nay
wife
he
means
our
giles
who
is
somewhat
small
of
stature
why
gainsay
what
gainsayed
may
not
be
ay
cried
the
pageant
that
is
he
and
discourseth
like
the
big
taber
his
breast
is
sound
for
that
matter
said
catherine
sharply
and
prompt
with
his
fists
though
at
long
else
how
would
the
poor
thing
keep
his
head
in
such
a
world
as
this
is
well
said
dame
art
as
ready
with
thy
weapon
as
he
art
his
mother
likely
so
bring
him
forth
and
that
presently
see
they
lead
a
stunted
mule
for
him
the
duke
hath
need
of
him
sore
need
we
are
clean
out
o
dwarven
and
which
may
not
be
whiles
earth
them
yieldeth
our
last
hop
o
my
thumb
tumbled
down
the
well
and
think
you
i
let
my
darling
go
to
such
an
house
as
you
where
the
reckless
trollops
of
servants
close
not
the
well
mouth
but
leave
it
open
to
trap
innocents
like
wolven
the
representative
of
autocracy
lost
patience
at
this
unwonted
opposition
and
with
stern
look
and
voice
bade
her
bethink
her
whether
it
was
the
better
of
the
two
to
have
your
abortion
at
court
fed
like
a
bishop
and
put
on
like
a
prince
or
to
have
all
your
heads
stricken
off
and
borne
on
poles
with
the
bellman
crying
the
heads
of
hardy
rebels
which
having
by
good
luck
a
misbegotten
son
did
traitorously
grudge
him
to
the
duke
who
is
the
true
father
of
all
his
folk
little
or
mickle
nay
said
eli
sadly
miscall
us
not
we
be
true
folk
and
neither
rebels
nor
traitors
but
is
sudden
and
the
poor
lad
is
our
true
flesh
and
blood
and
hath
of
late
given
proof
of
more
sense
than
avails
not
threatening
our
lives
whimpered
catherine
we
grudge
him
not
to
the
duke
but
in
sooth
he
can
not
go
his
linen
is
all
in
holes
so
there
is
an
but
the
male
mind
resisted
this
crusher
think
you
the
duke
will
not
find
linen
and
cloth
of
gold
to
boot
none
so
brave
none
so
affected
at
court
as
our
monsters
big
or
how
long
the
dispute
might
have
lasted
before
the
iron
arguments
of
despotism
achieved
the
inevitable
victory
i
know
not
but
it
was
cut
short
by
a
party
whom
neither
disputant
had
deigned
to
consult
the
bone
of
contention
walked
out
of
the
house
and
sided
with
monarchy
if
my
folk
are
mad
i
am
not
he
roared
i
go
with
you
and
on
the
at
this
catherine
set
up
a
piteous
cry
she
saw
another
of
her
brood
escaping
from
under
her
wing
into
some
unknown
element
giles
was
not
quite
insensible
to
her
distress
so
simple
yet
so
eloquent
he
said
nay
take
not
on
mother
why
is
a
godsend
and
i
am
sick
of
this
ever
since
gerard
left
ah
cruel
giles
should
ye
not
rather
say
she
is
bereaved
of
gerard
the
more
need
of
you
to
stay
aside
her
and
comfort
oh
i
am
not
going
to
rome
not
such
a
fool
i
shall
never
be
farther
than
rotterdam
and
i
often
come
and
see
you
and
if
i
like
not
the
place
who
shall
keep
me
there
not
all
the
dukes
in
good
sense
lies
in
little
bulk
said
the
emissary
approvingly
therefore
master
giles
buss
the
old
folk
and
thank
them
for
misbegetting
of
thee
and
ho
you
bring
hither
his
one
of
his
retinue
brought
up
the
dwarf
mule
giles
refused
it
with
scorn
and
on
being
asked
the
reason
said
it
was
not
just
what
would
ye
throw
all
into
one
scale
put
muckle
to
muckle
and
little
to
wee
besides
i
hate
and
scorn
small
things
i
go
on
the
highest
horse
here
or
not
at
the
pursuivant
eyed
him
attentively
a
moment
he
then
adopted
a
courteous
manner
i
shall
study
your
will
in
all
things
reasonable
dismount
eric
yours
is
the
highest
horse
and
if
you
would
halt
in
the
town
an
hour
or
so
while
you
bid
them
farewell
say
but
the
word
and
your
pleasure
shall
be
my
giles
reflected
master
said
he
if
we
wait
a
month
be
still
the
same
my
mother
is
a
good
soul
but
her
body
is
bigger
than
her
spirit
we
shall
not
part
without
a
tear
or
two
and
the
quicker
is
done
the
fewer
so
bring
yon
horse
to
catherine
threw
her
apron
over
her
face
and
sobbed
the
high
horse
was
brought
and
giles
was
for
swarming
up
his
tail
like
a
rope
but
one
of
the
servants
cried
out
hastily
forbear
for
he
i
kick
him
said
giles
bring
him
close
beneath
this
window
and
i
learn
you
all
how
to
mount
a
horse
which
kicketh
and
will
not
be
clomb
by
the
tail
the
staircase
of
a
and
he
dashed
into
the
house
and
almost
immediately
reappeared
at
an
upper
window
with
a
rope
in
his
hand
he
fastened
an
end
somehow
and
holding
the
other
descended
as
swift
and
smooth
as
an
oiled
thunderbolt
in
a
groove
and
lighted
astride
his
high
horse
as
unperceived
by
that
animal
as
a
fly
settling
on
him
the
official
lifted
his
hands
to
heaven
in
mawkish
admiration
i
have
gotten
a
pearl
thought
he
and
wow
but
this
will
be
a
good
day
work
for
come
father
come
mother
buss
me
and
bless
me
and
off
i
eli
gave
him
his
blessing
and
bade
him
be
honest
and
true
and
a
credit
to
his
folk
catherine
could
not
speak
but
clung
to
him
with
many
sobs
and
embraces
and
even
through
the
mist
of
tears
her
eye
detected
in
a
moment
the
little
rent
in
his
sleeve
he
had
made
getting
out
of
window
and
she
whipped
out
her
needle
and
mended
it
then
and
there
and
her
tears
fell
on
his
arm
the
while
unheeded
except
by
those
unfleshly
eyes
with
which
they
say
the
very
air
is
thronged
and
so
the
dwarf
mounted
the
high
horse
and
rode
away
complacent
with
the
old
hand
laying
the
court
butter
on
his
back
with
a
trowel
little
recked
perpusillus
of
two
poor
silly
females
that
sat
by
the
bereaved
hearth
rocking
themselves
and
weeping
and
discussing
all
his
virtues
and
how
his
mind
had
opened
lately
and
blind
as
two
beetles
to
his
faults
who
rode
away
from
them
jocund
and
bold
ingentes
animos
angusto
pectore
versans
arrived
at
court
he
speedily
became
a
great
favourite
one
strange
propensity
of
his
electrified
the
palace
but
on
account
of
his
small
size
and
for
variety
sake
and
as
a
monster
he
was
indulged
on
it
in
a
word
he
was
let
speak
the
truth
it
is
an
unpopular
thing
he
made
it
an
intolerable
one
bawled
it
chapter
lix
happy
the
man
who
has
two
merit

oh
that

francesco

a
young
nobleman
of
florence

at

his
object

he
retired
from

and

the
humming

the
stinging
of
the

to
dominic
and
the
nine
muses
an
eager
student
of
languages
pictures
statues
chronology
coins
and
monumental
inscriptions
these
last
loosened
his
faith
in
popular
histories
he
travelled
many
years
in
the
east
and
returned
laden
with
spoils
master
of
several
choice
and
versed
in
greek
and
latin
hebrew
and

found
his
country

not
stood
still
other
lettered
princes
besides
cosmo
had
sprung
up
alfonso
king
of
naples
nicolas

above
all
his
old
friend
thomas
of

had
been
made
pope
and
had
lent
a
mighty
impulse
to
letters
had
accumulated
mss
in
the
library
of
the

and
had
set

thucydides
theodore

the

found

aristotle
under
armistice
but
poggio
and
valla
at
loggerheads
over
verbs
and
nouns
and
on
fire
with
odium
philologicum
all
this
was
heaven
and
he
settled
down
in
his
native
land
his
life
a
rosy
dream
none
so
happy
as
the
versatile
provided
they
have
not
their
bread
to
make
by
it
and
fra

was
versatility
he

a
little

could
write
a

paint
a

a

sing
a

in

he

was
for
gauge
the
intellects
of
your
acquaintances
and
you
will
find
but
few
whose
minds
are
neither
deaf
nor
blind
nor
dead
to
some
great
art
or
science
and
wisdom
at
one
entrance
quite
shut

such
of

conceited
as

as
stupid

even
parade
instead
of
blushing

the
holes
in
their
intellects
a
zealot
in
art
the
friar
was
a
sceptic
in
religion
in
every
age
there
are
a
few
men
who
hold
the
opinions
of
another
age
past
or
future
being
a
lump
of
simplicity
his
sceptism
was
as
naif
as
his
enthusiasm
he
affected
to
look
on
the
religious
ceremonies
of
his
day
as
his
models
the
heathen
philosophers
regarded
the
worship
of
gods
and
departed
heroes
mummeries
good
for
the
populace
but
here
his
mind
drew
unconsciously
a
droll
distinction
whatever
christian
ceremony
his
learning
taught
him
was
of
purely
pagan
origin
that
he
respected
out
of
respect
for
antiquity
though
had
he
with
his
turn
of
mind
been
a
pagan
and
its
contemporary
he
would
have
scorned
it
from
his
philosophic
heights
fra
colonna
was
charmed
with
his
new
artist
and
having
the
run
of
half
the
palaces
in
rome
sounded
his
praises
so
that
he
was
soon
called
upon
to
resign
him
he
told
gerard
what
great
princes
wanted
him
but
i
am
so
happy
with
you
father
objected
gerard
fiddlestick
about
being
happy
with
me
said
fra
colonna
you
must
not
be
happy
you
must
be
a
man
of
the
world
the
grand
lesson
i
impress
on
the
young
is
be
a
man
of
the
world
now
these
montesini
can
pay
you
three
times
as
much
as
i
can
and
they
shall
and
the
friar
clapped
a
terrific
price
on
gerard
pen
it
was
acceded
to
without
a
murmur
much
higher
prices
were

the

are
mighty
sweet
upon
all
their
pets
while
the
fancy
lasts
and
in
the
rage
for
greek
mss
the
handsome
writer
soon
became
a
pet
and
nobles
of
both
sexes
caressed
him
like
a
lap
dog
it
would
have
turned
a
vain
fellow
head
but
the
canny
dutchman
saw
the
steel
hand
beneath
the
velvet
glove
and
did
not
presume
nevertheless
it
was
a
proud
day
for
him
when
he
found
himself
seated
with
fra
colonna
at
the
table
of
his
present
employer
cardinal
bessarion
they
were
about
a
mile
from
the
top
of
that
table
but
never
mind
there
they
were
and
gerard
had
the
advantage
of
seeing
roast
pheasants
dished
up
with
all
their
feathers
as
if
they
had
just
flown
out
of
a
coppice
instead
of
off
the
spit
also
chickens
cooked
in
bottles
and
tender
as
peaches
but
the
grand
novelty
was
the
napkins
surpassingly
fine
and
folded
into
cocked
hats
and
birds
wings
and
fans
instead
of
lying
flat
this
electrified
gerard
though
my
readers
have
seen
the
dazzling
phenomenon
without
tumbling
backwards
chair
and
all
after
dinner
the
tables
were
split
in
pieces
and
carried
away
and
lo
under
each
was
another
table
spread
with
sweetmeats
the
signoras
and
signorinas
fell
upon
them
and
gormandized
but
the
signors
eyed
them
with
reasonable
suspicion
but
dear
father
objected
gerard
i
see
not
the
bifurcal
daggers
with
which
men
say
his
excellency
armeth
the
left
hand
of
a
nay
is
the
cardinal
orsini
which
hath
invented
yon
peevish
instrument
for
his
guests
to
fumble
their
meat
withal
one
being
in
haste
did
skewer
his
tongue
to
his
palate
with
it
i
hear
o
tempora
o

the
ancients
reclining
godlike
at
their
feasts
how
had
they
spurned
such
as
soon
as
the
ladies
had
disported
themselves
among
the
the
tables
were
suddenly
removed
and
the
guests
sat
in
a
row
against
the
wall
then
came
in
ducking
and
scraping
two
ecclesiastics
with
lutes
and
kneeled
at
the
cardinal
feet
and
there
sang
the
service
of
the
day
then
retired
with
a
deep
obeisance
in
answer
to
which
the
cardinal
fingered
his
skull
cap
as
our
late
iron
duke
his
hat
the
company
dispersed
and
gerard
had
dined
with
a
cardinal
and
one
that
had
thrice
just
missed
being
pope
but
greater
honour
was
in
store
one
day
the
cardinal
sent
for
him
and
after
praising
the
beauty
of
his
work
took
him
in
his
coach
to
the
vatican
and
up
a
private
stair
to
a
luxurious
little
room
with
a
great
oriel
window
here
were
inkstands
sloping
frames
for
writing
on
and
all
the
instruments
of
art
the
cardinal
whispered
a
courtier
and
presently
the
pope
private
secretary
appeared
with
a
glorious
grimy
old
of
plutarch
lives
and
soon
gerard
was
seated
alone
copying
it
yet
half
delighted
at
the
thought
that
his
holiness
would
handle
his
work
and
read
it
the
papal
inkstands
were
all
glorious
externally
but
within
the
ink
was
vile
but
gerard
carried
ever
good
ink
in
a
dirty
little
inkhorn
he
prayed
on
his
knees
for
a
firm
and
skilful
hand
and
set
to
work
one
side
of
his
room
was
nearly
occupied
by
a
massive
curtain
divided
in
the
centre
but
its
ample
folds
overlapped
after
a
while
gerard
felt
drawn
to
peep
through
that
curtain
he
resisted
the
impulse
it
returned
it
overpowered
him
he
left
plutarch
stole
across
the
matted
floor
took
the
folds
of
the
curtain
and
gently
gathered
them
up
with
his
fingers
and
putting
his
nose
through
the
chink
ran
it
against
a
cold
steel
halbert
two
soldiers
armed
were
holding
their
glittering
weapons
crossed
in
a
triangle
gerard
drew
swiftly
back
but
in
that
instant
he
heard
the
soft
murmur
of
voices
and
saw
a
group
of
persons
cringing
before
some
hidden
figure
he
never
repeated
his
attempt
to
pry
through
the
guarded
curtain
but
often
eyed
it
every
hour
or
so
an
ecclesiastic
peeped
in
eyed
him
chilled
him
and
exit
all
this
was
gloomy
and
mechanical
but
the
next
day
a
gentleman
richly
armed
bounced
in
and
glared
at
him
what
is
toward
here
said
he
gerard
told
him
he
was
writing
out
plutarch
with
the
help
of
the
saints
the
spark
said
he
did
not
know
the
signor
in
question
gerard
explained
the
circumstances
of
time
and
space
that
had
deprived
the
signor
plutarch
of
the
advantage
of
the
spark
conversation
oh
one
of
those
old
dead
greeks
they
keep
such
a
coil
ay
signor
one
of
them
who
being
dead
yet
i
understand
you
not
young
man
said
the
noble
with
all
the
dignity
of
ignorance
what
did
the
old
fellow
write
love
stories
and
his
eyes
sparkled
merry
tales
like
nay
lives
of
heroes
and
soldiers
and
popes
soldiers
and
wilt
read
me
of
them
some
day
and
willingly
signor
but
what
would
they
say
who
employ
me
were
i
to
break
off
work
oh
never
heed
that
know
you
not
who
i
am
i
am
jacques
bonaventura
nephew
to
his
holiness
the
pope
and
captain
of
his
guards
and
i
came
here
to
look
after
my
fellows
i
trow
they
have
turned
them
out
of
their
room
for
signor
bonaventura
then
hurried
away
this
lively
companion
however
having
acquired
a
habit
of
running
into
that
little
room
and
finding
gerard
good
company
often
looked
in
on
him
and
chattered
ephemeralities
while
gerard
wrote
the
immortal
lives
one
day
he
came
a
changed
and
moody
man
and
threw
himself
into
chair
crying
ah
traitress
traitress
gerard
inquired
what
was
his
ill
traitress
traitress
was
the
reply
whereupon
gerard
wrote
plutarch
then
says
bonaventura
i
am
melancholy
and
for
our
lady
sake
read
me
a
story
out
of
ser
plutarcho
to
soothe
my
bile
in
all
that
greek
is
there
nought
about
lovers
betrayed
gerard
read
him
the
life
of
alexander
he
got
excited
marched
about
the
room
and
embracing
the
reader
vowed
to
shun
soft
delights
that
bed
of
nettles
and
follow
glory
who
so
happy
now
as
gerard
his
art
was
honoured
and
fabulous
prices
paid
for
it
in
a
year
or
two
he
should
return
by
sea
to
holland
with
good
store
of
money
and
set
up
with
his
beloved
margaret
in
bruges
or
antwerp
or
dear
augsburg
and
end
their
days
in
peace
and
love
and
healthy
happy
labour
his
heart
never
strayed
an
instant
from
her
in
his
prosperity
he
did
not
forget
poor
pietro
he
took
the
fra
colonna
to
see
his
picture
the
friar
inspected
it
severely
and
closely
fell
on
the
artist
neck
and
carried
the
picture
to
one
of
the
colonnas
who
gave
a
noble
price
for
it
pietro
descended
to
the
first
floor
and
lived
like
a
gentleman
but
gerard
remained
in
his
garret
to
increase
his
expenses
would
have
been
to
postpone
his
return
to
margaret
luxury
had
no
charms
for
the
one
when
opposed
to
love
jacques
bonaventura
made
him
acquainted
with
other
gay
young
fellows
they
loved
him
and
sought
to
entice
him
into
vice
and
other
expenses
but
he
begged
humbly
to
be
excused
so
he
escaped
that
temptation
but
a
greater
was
behind
chapter
lx
fra
colonna
had
the
run
of
the
pope
library
and
sometimes
left
off
work
at
the
same
hour
and
walked
the
city
with
gerard
on
which
occasions
the
happy
artist
saw
all
things
en
beau
and
was
wrapped
up
in
the
grandeur
of
rome
and
its
churches
palaces
and
ruins
the
friar
granted
the
ruins
but
threw
cold
water
on
the
rest
this
place
rome
it
is
but
the
tomb
of
mighty
he
showed
gerard
that
twenty
or
thirty
feet
of
the
old
triumphal
arches
were
underground
and
that
the
modern
streets
ran
over
ancient
palaces
and
over
the
tops
of
columns
and
coupling
this
with
the
comparatively
narrow
limits
of
the
modern
city
and
the
gigantic
vestiges
of
antiquity
that
peeped
aboveground
here
and
there
he
uttered
a
somewhat
remarkable
simile
i
tell
thee
this
village
they
call
rome
is
but
as
one
of
those
nests
ye
shall
see
built
on
the
eaves
of
a
decayed
old
rome
must
indeed
have
been
fair
then
said
gerard
judge
for
yourself
my
son
you
see
the
great
sewer
the
work
of
the
romans
in
their
very
childhood
and
shall
outlast
vesuvius
you
see
the
fragments
of
the
temple
of
peace
how
would
you
look
could
you
see
also
the
capitol
with
its
temples
do
but
note
this
monte
savello
what
is
it
an
it
pleases
you
but
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
theatre
of
marcellus
and
as
for
testacio
one
of
the
highest
hills
in
modern
rome
it
is
but
an
ancient
dust
heap
the
women
of
old
rome
flung
their
broken
pots
and
pans
there
and
lo
a
mountain
pede
herculem
ex
ungue
leonem
gerard
listened
respectfully
but
when
the
holy
friar
proceeded
by
analogy
to
imply
that
the
moral
superiority
of
the
heathen
romans
was
proportionally
grand
he
resisted
stoutly
has
then
the
world
lost
by
christ
his
coming
said
he
but
blushed
for
he
felt
himself
reproaching
his
benefactor
saints
forbid
said
the
friar
heresy
to
say
and
having
made
this
direct
concession
he
proceeded
gradually
to
evade
it
by
subtle
circumlocution
and
reached
the
forbidden
door
by
the
spiral
back
staircase
in
the
midst
of
all
which
they
came
to
a
church
with
a
knot
of
persons
in
the
porch
a
demon
was
being
exorcised
within
now
fra
colonna
had
a
way
of
uttering
a
curious
sort
of
little
moan
when
things
zeno
or
epicurus
would
not
have
swallowed
were
presented
to
him
as
facts
this
moan
conveyed
to
such
as
had
often
heard
it
not
only
strong
dissent
but
pity
for
human
credulity
ignorance
and
error
especially
of
course
when
it
blinded
men
to
the
merits
of
pagandom
the
friar
moaned
and
said
then
come
away
nay
father
prithee
prithee
i
saw
a
divell
cast
the
friar
accompanied
gerard
into
the
church
but
had
a
good
shrug
first
there
they
found
the
demoniac
forced
down
on
his
knees
before
the
altar
with
a
scarf
tied
round
his
neck
by
which
the
officiating
priest
held
him
like
a
dog
in
a
chain
not
many
persons
were
present
for
fame
had
put
forth
that
the
last
demon
cast
out
in
that
church
went
no
farther
than
into
one
of
the
company
as
a
cony
ferreted
out
of
one
burrow
runs
to
the
when
gerard
and
the
friar
came
up
the
priest
seemed
to
think
there
were
now
spectators
enough
and
began
he
faced
the
demoniac
breviary
in
hand
and
first
set
himself
to
learn
the
individual
name
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
come
out
ashtaroth
oho
it
is
not
you
then
come
out

come
out

aha
what
have
i
found
ye
is
thou
thou
reptile
at
thine
old
tricks
let
us
pray
oh
lord
we
pray
thee
to
drive
the
foul
fiend
nebul
out
of
this
thy
creature
out
of
his
hair
and
his
eyes
out
of
his
nose
out
of
his
mouth
out
of
his
ears
out
of
his
gums
out
of
his
teeth
out
of
his
shoulders
out
of
his
arms
legs
loins
stomach
bowels
thighs
knees
calves
feet
ankles
and
soul
the
priest
then
rose
from
his
knees
and
turning
to
the
company
said
with
quiet
geniality
gentles
we
have
here
as
obstinate
a
divell
as
you
may
see
in
a
summer
then
facing
the
patient
he
spoke
to
him
with
great
rigour
sometimes
addressing
man
and
sometimes
the
fiend
and
they
answered
him
in
turn
through
the
same
mouth
now
saying
that
they
hated
those
holy
names
the
priest
kept
uttering
and
now
complaining
they
did
feel
so
bad
in
their
inside
it
was
the
priest
who
first
confounded
the
victim
and
the
culprit
in
idea
by
pitching
into
the
former
cuffing
him
soundly
kicking
him
and
spitting
repeatedly
in
his
face
then
he
took
a
candle
and
lighted
it
and
turned
it
down
and
burned
it
till
it
burned
his
fingers
when
he
dropped
it
double
quick
then
took
the
custodial
and
showed
the
patient
the
corpus
domini
within
then
burned
another
candle
as
before
but
more
cautiously
then
spoke
civilly
to
the
demoniac
in
his
human
character
dismissed
him
and
received
the
compliments
of
the
company
good
father
said
gerard
how
you
have
their
names
by
heart
our
northern
priests
have
no
such
exquisite
knowledge
of
the
hellish
ay
young
man
here
we
know
all
their
names
and
eke
their
ways
the
reptiles
this
nebul
is
a
bitter
hard
one
to
hunt
he
then
told
the
company
in
the
most
affable
way
several
of
his
experiences
concluding
with
his
feat
of
yesterday
when
he
drove
a
great
hulking
fiend
out
of
a
woman
by
her
mouth
leaving
behind
him
certain
nails
and
pins
and
a
tuft
of
his
own
hair
and
cried
out
in
a
voice
of
anguish
is
not
thou
that
conquers
me
see
that
stone
on
the
window
sill
know
that
the
angel
gabriel
coming
down
to
earth
once
lighted
on
that
stone
is
that
has
done
my
the
friar
moaned
and
you
believed
him
certes
who
but
an
infidel
has
discredited
a
revelation
so
what
believe
the
father
of
lies
that
is
pushing
credulity
beyond
the
oh
a
liar
does
not
always
ay
doth
he
whenever
he
tells
an
improbable
story
to
begin
and
shows
you
a
holy
relic
arms
you
against
the
satanic
host
fiends
if
any
be
not
so
simple
shouldst
have
answered
him
out
of
antiquity
danaos
et
dona
ferentes
some
blackguard
chopped
his
wife
head
off
on
that
stone
young
man
you
take
my
word
for
and
the
friar
hurried
gerard
away
alack
father
i
fear
you
abashed
the
good
ay
by
pollux
said
the
friar
with
a
chuckle
i
blistered
him
with
a
single
touch
of
interrogation
what
modern
can
parry
the
weapons
of
one
afternoon
when
gerard
had
finished
his
day
work
a
fine
lackey
came
and
demanded
his
attendance
at
the
palace
cesarini
he
went
and
was
ushered
into
a
noble
apartment
there
was
a
girl
seated
in
it
working
on
a
tapestry
she
rose
and
left
the
room
and
said
she
would
let
her
mistress
know
a
good
hour
did
gerard
cool
his
heels
in
that
great
room
and
at
last
he
began
to
fret
these
nobles
think
nothing
of
a
poor
fellow
however
just
as
he
was
making
up
his
mind
to
slip
out
and
go
about
his
business
the
door
opened
and
a
superb
beauty
entered
the
room
followed
by
two
maids
it
was
the
young
princess
of
the
house
of
cesarini
she
came
in
talking
rather
loudly
and
haughtily
to
her
dependents
but
at
sight
of
gerard
lowered
her
voice
to
a
very
feminine
tone
and
said
are
you
the
writer
messer
i
am

is
she
then
seated
herself
gerard
and
her
maids
remained
standing

my
lover
at
least
he
says
gerard
seated
himself
took
out
paper
and
ink
and
looked
up
to
the
princess
for
instructions
she
seated
on
a
much
higher
chair
almost
a
throne
looked
down
at
him
with
eyes
equally
inquiring

your
grace
whose
letter
it
is
to
be
gramercy
what
you
writers
find
you
not

words
what
avails
your
art
without
the
words
i
doubt
you
are
an
impostor
nay
signora
i
am
none
i
might
make
shift
to
put
your
speech
into
grammar
as
well
as
writing
but
i
can
not
interpret
your
silence
therefore
speak
what
is
in
your
heart
and
i
will
empaper
it
before
your
but
there
is
nothing
in
my
heart
and
sometimes
i
think
i
have
got
no
what
is
in
your
mind
then
but
there
is
nothing
in
my
mind
nor
my
head
then
why
write
at
all
why
indeed
that
is
the
first
word
of
sense
either
you
or
i
have
spoken
gerardo
pestilence
seize
him
why
writeth
he
not
first
then
i
could
say
nay
to
this
and
ay
to
that
withouten
headache
also
is
it
a
lady
part
to
say
the
first
word
no
signora
the
it
is
well
spoken
gerardo
ha
ha
shalt
have
a
gold
piece
for
thy
wit
give
me
my
purse
and
she
paid
him
for
the
article
on
the
nail
a
la
moyen
age
money
never
yet
chilled
zeal
gerard
after
getting
a
gold
piece
so
cheap
felt
bound
to
pull
her
out
of
her
difficulty
if
the
wit
of
man
might
achieve
it
signorina
said
he
these
things
are
only
hard
because
folk
attempt
too
much
are
artificial
and
labour
phrases
do
but
figure
to
yourself
the
signor
you
love
i
love
him
well
then
the
signor
you
love
at
this
table
and
dict
to
me
just
what
you
would
say
to
well
if
he
sat
there
i
should
say
away
gerard
who
was
flourishing
his
pen
by
way
of
preparation
laid
it
down
with
a
groan
and
when
he
was
gone
said
floretta
your
highness
would
say
back
like
enough
wench
now
silence
all
and
let
me
think
he
pestered
me
to
write
and
i
promised
so
mine
honour
is
engaged
what
lie
shall
i
tell
the
gerardo
to
tell
the
fool
and
she
turned
her
head
away
from
them
and
fell
into
deep
thought
with
her
noble
chin
resting
on
her
white
hand
half
clenched
she
was
so
lovely
and
statuesque
and
looked
so
inspired
with
thoughts
celestial
as
she
sat
thus
impregnating
herself
with
mendacity
that
gerard
forgot
all
except
art
and
proceeded
eagerly
to
transfer
that
exquisite
profile
to
paper
he
had
very
nearly
finished
when
the
fair
statue
turned
brusquely
round
and
looked
at
him
nay
signora
said
he
a
little
peevishly
for
heaven
sake
change
not
your
posture
was
perfect
see
you
are
nearly
all
eyes
were
instantly
on
the
work
and
all
tongues
active
how
like
and
done
in
a
minute
nay
methinks
her
highness
chin
is
not
quite
oh
a
touch
will
make
that
what
a
pity
is
not
coloured
i
all
for
colours
hang
black
and
white
and
her
highness
hath
such
a
lovely
skin
take
away
her
skin
and
half
her
beauty
is
peace
can
you
colour
ser
gerardo
ay
signorina
i
am
a
poor
hand
at
oils
there
shines
my
friend
pietro
but
in
this
small
way
i
can
tint
you
to
the
life
if
you
have
time
to
waste
on
such
call
you
this
vanity
and
for
time
it
hangs
on
me
like
lead
send
for
your
colours
now
quick
this
moment
for
love
of
all
the
nay
signorina
i
must
prepare
them
i
could
come
at
the
same
so
be
it
and
you
floretta
see
that
he
be
admitted
at
all
hours
alack
leave
my
head
leave
my
head
forgive
me
signora
i
thought
to
prepare
it
at
home
to
receive
the
colours
but
i
will
leave
it
and
now
let
us
despatch
the
what
letter
to
the
signor
and
shall
i
waste
my
time
on
such
vanity
as
writing
letters
and
to
that
empty
creature
to
whom
i
am
as
indifferent
as
the
moon
nay
not
indifferent
for
i
have
just
discovered
my
real
sentiments
i
hate
him
and
despise
him
girls
i
here
forbid
you
once
for
all
to
mention
that
signor
name
to
me
again
else
i
whip
you
till
the
blood
comes
you
know
how
i
can
lay
on
when
i
we
do
we
then
provoke
me
not
to
it
and
her
eye
flashed
daggers
and
she
turned
to
gerard
all
instantaneous
honey
addio
il
and
gerard
bowed
himself
out
of
this
velvet
tiger
den
he
came
next
day
and
coloured
her
and
next
he
was
set
to
make
a
portrait
of
her
on
a
large
scale
and
then
a
figure
and
he
was
obliged
to
set
apart
two
hours
in
the
afternoon
for
drawing
and
painting
this
princess
whose
beauty
and
vanity
were
prodigious
and
candidates
for
a
portrait
of
her
numerous
here
the
thriving
gerard
found
a
new
and
fruitful
source
of
income
margaret
seemed
nearer
and
nearer
it
was
holy
thursday
no
work
this
day
fra
colonna
and
gerard
sat
in
a
window
and
saw
the
religious
processions
their
number
and
pious
ardour
thrilled
gerard
with
the
devotion
that
now
seemed
to
animate
the
whole
people
lately
bent
on
earthly
joys
presently
the
pope
came
pacing
majestically
at
the
head
of
his
cardinals
in
a
red
hat
white
cloak
a
capuchin
of
red
velvet
and
riding
a
lovely
white
neapolitan
barb
caparisoned
with
red
velvet
fringed
and
tasselled
with
gold
a
hundred
horsemen
armed
rode
behind
him
with
their
lances
erected
the
resting
on
the
man
thigh
the
cardinals
went
uncovered
all
but
one
de
medicis
who
rode
close
to
the
pope
and
conversed
with
him
as
with
an
equal
at
every
fifteen
steps
the
pope
stopped
a
single
moment
and
gave
the
people
his
blessing
then
on
again
gerard
and
the
friar
now
came
down
and
threading
some
reached
the
portico
of
one
of
the
seven
churches
it
was
hung
with
black
and
soon
the
pope
and
cardinals
who
had
entered
the
church
by
another
door
issued
forth
and
stood
with
torches
on
the
steps
separated
by
barriers
from
the
people
then
a
canon
read
a
latin
bull
excommunicating
several
persons
by
name
especially
such
princes
as
were
keeping
the
church
out
of
any
of
her
temporal
possessions
at
this
awful
ceremony
gerard
trembled
and
so
did
the
people
but
two
of
the
cardinals
spoiled
the
effect
by
laughing
unreservedly
the
whole
time
when
this
was
ended
the
black
cloth
was
removed
and
revealed
a
gay
panoply
and
the
pope
blessed
the
people
and
ended
by
throwing
his
torch
among
them
so
did
two
cardinals
instantly
there
was
a
scramble
for
the
torches
they
were
fought
for
and
torn
in
pieces
by
the
candidates
so
devoutly
that
small
fragments
were
gained
at
the
price
of
black
eyes
bloody
noses
and
burnt
fingers
in
which
hurtling
his
holiness
and
suite
withdrew
in
peace
and
now
there
was
a
cry
and
the
crowd
rushed
to
a
square
where
was
a
large
open
stage
several
priests
were
upon
it
praying
they
rose
and
with
great
ceremony
donned
red
gloves
then
one
of
their
number
kneeled
and
with
signs
of
the
lowest
reverence
drew
forth
from
a
shrine
a
square
frame
like
that
of
a
mirror
and
inside
was
as
it
were
the
impression
of
a
face
it
was
the
verum
icon
or
true
impression
of
our
saviour
face
taken
at
the
very
moment
of
his
most
mortal
agony
for
us
received
as
it
was
without
a
grain
of
doubt
imagine
how
it
moved
every
christian
heart
the
people
threw
themselves
on
their
faces
when
the
priest
raised
it
on
high
and
cries
of
pity
were
in
every
mouth
and
tears
in
almost
every
eye
after
a
while
the
people
rose
and
then
the
priest
went
round
the
platform
showing
it
for
a
single
moment
to
the
nearest
and
at
each
sight
loud
cries
of
pity
and
devotion
burst
forth
soon
after
this
the
friends
fell
in
with
a
procession
of
flagellants
flogging
their
bare
shoulders
till
the
blood
ran
streaming
down
but
without
a
sign
of
pain
in
their
faces
and
many
of
them
laughing
and
jesting
as
they
lashed
the
bystanders
out
of
pity
offered
them
wine
they
took
it
but
few
drank
it
they
generally
used
it
to
free
the
tails
of
the
cat
which
were
hard
with
clotted
blood
and
make
the
next
stroke
more
effective
most
of
them
were
boys
and
a
young
woman
took
pity
on
one
fair
urchin
alas
dear
child
said
she
why
wound
thy
white
skin
so
basta
said
he
laughing
is
for
your
sins
i
do
it
not
for
hear
you
that
said
the
friar
show
me
the
whip
that
can
whip
the
vanity
out
of
man
heart
the
young
monkey
how
knoweth
he
that
stranger
is
a
sinner
more
than
he
father
said
gerard
surely
this
is
not
to
our
lord
mind
he
was
so
our
lord
said
the
friar
crossing
himself
what
has
he
to
do
with
this
this
was
a
custom
in
rome
six
hundred
years
before
he
was
born
the
boys
used
to
go
through
the
streets
at
the
lupercalia
flogging
themselves
and
the
married
women
used
to
shove
in
and
try
and
get
a
blow
from
the
monkeys
scourges
for
these
blows
conferred
fruitfulness
in
those
days
a
foolish
trick
this
flagellation
but
interesting
to
the
bystander
reminds
him
of
the
grand
old
heathen
we
are
so
prone
to
forget
all
we
owe
next
they
got
into
one
of
the
seven
churches
and
saw
the
pope
give
the
mass
the
ceremony
was
imposing
but
again
spoiled
by
the
inconsistent
conduct
of
the
cardinals
and
other
prelates
who
sat
about
the
altar
with
their
hats
on
chattering
all
through
the
mass
like
a
flock
of
geese
the
eucharist
in
both
kinds
was
tasted
by
an
official
before
the
pope
would
venture
on
it
and
this
surprised
gerard
beyond
measure
who
is
that
base
man
and
what
doth
he
there
oh
that
is
preguste
and
he
tastes
the
eucharist
by
way
of
precaution
this
is
the
country
for
poison
and
none
fall
oftener
by
it
than
the
poor
alas
so
i
have
heard
but
after
the
miraculous
change
of
the
bread
and
wine
to
christ
his
body
and
blood
poison
can
not
remain
gone
is
the
bread
with
all
its
properties
and
accidents
gone
is
the
so
says
faith
but
experience
tells
another
tale
scores
have
died
in
italy
poisoned
in
the
and
i
tell
you
father
that
were
both
bread
and
wine
charged
with
direst
poison
before
his
holiness
had
consecrated
them
yet
after
consecration
i
would
take
them
both
withouten
so
would
i
but
for
the
fine
what
mean
you
marry
that
i
would
be
as
ready
to
leave
the
world
as
thou
were
it
not
for
those
arts
which
beautify
existence
here
below
and
make
it
dear
to
men
of
sense
and
education
no
so
long
as
the
nine
muses
strew
my
path
with
roses
of
learning
and
art
me
may
apollo
inspire
with
wisdom
and
caution
that
knowing
the
wiles
of
my
countrymen
i
may
eat
poison
neither
at
god
altar
nor
at
a
friend
table
since
wherever
i
eat
it
or
drink
it
it
will
assuredly
cut
short
my
mortal
thread
and
i
am
writing
a
book
heart
and
soul
in
it
dream
of
polifilo
the
man
of
many
arts
so
name
not
poison
to
me
till
that
is
finished
and
and
now
the
great
bells
of
john
lateran
were
rung
with
a
clash
at
short
intervals
and
the
people
hurried
thither
to
see
the
heads
of
peter
and
paul
gerard
and
the
friar
got
a
good
place
in
the
church
and
there
was
a
great
curtain
and
after
long
and
breathless
expectation
of
the
people
this
curtain
was
drawn
by
jerks
and
at
a
height
of
about
thirty
feet
were
two
human
heads
with
bearded
faces
that
seemed
alive
they
were
shown
no
longer
than
the
time
to
say
an
ave
maria
and
then
the
curtain
drawn
but
they
were
shown
in
this
fashion
three
times
complexion
was
pale
his
face
oval
his
beard
grey
and
forked
his
head
crowned
with
a
papal
mitre
paul
was
dark
skinned
with
a
thick
square
beard
his
face
also
and
head
were
more
square
and
massive
and
full
of
resolution
gerard
was
the
friar
approved
after
his
fashion
this
exhibition
of
the
or
waxen
effigies
of
heroes
and
demigods
is
a
venerable
custom
and
inciteth
the
vulgar
to
virtue
by
great
and
invisible
examples
waxen
images
what
are
they
not
the
apostles
themselves
embalmed
or
the
like
the
friar
moaned
they
did
not
exist
in
the
year
the
great
old
roman
families
always
produced
at
their
funerals
a
series
of
these
thereby
tying
past
and
present
history
together
and
showing
the
populace
the
features
of
worthies
i
can
conceive
nothing
more
thrilling
or
instructive
but
then
the
effigies
were
portraits
made
during
life
or
at
the
hour
of
death
these
of
paul
and
peter
are
moulded
out
of
pure
ah
say
not
so
but
the
worst
is
this
humour
of
showing
them
up
on
a
shelf
and
half
in
the
dark
and
by
snatches
and
with
the
poor
mountebank
trick
of
a
drawn
curtain
ostendis
mihi
sic
incredulus
odi
enough
the
men
of
this
day
are
not
the
men
of
old
let
us
have
done
with
these
mummeries
and
go
among
the
pope
books
there
we
shall
find
the
wisdom
we
shall
vainly
hunt
in
the
streets
of
modern
and
this
idea
having
once
taken
root
the
good
friar
plunged
and
tore
through
the
crowd
and
looked
neither
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
till
he
had
escaped
the
glories
of
the
holy
week
which
had
brought
fifty
thousand
strangers
to
rome
and
had
got
nice
and
quiet
among
the
dead
in
the
library
of
the
vatican
presently
going
into
gerard
room
he
found
a
hot
dispute
afoot
between
him
and
jacques
bonaventura
that
spark
had
come
in
all
steel
from
head
to
toe
doffed
helmet
puffed
and
railed
most
scornfully
on
a
ridiculous
ceremony
at
which
he
and
his
soldiers
had
been
compelled
to
attend
the
pope
to
wit
the
blessing
of
the
beasts
of
burden
gerard
said
it
was
not
ridiculous
nothing
a
pope
did
could
be
ridiculous
the
argument
grew
warm
and
the
friar
stood
grimly
neuter
waiting
like
the
stork
that
ate
the
frog
and
the
mouse
at
the
close
of
their
combat
to
grind
them
both
between
the
jaws
of
antiquity
when
lo
the
curtain
was
gently
drawn
and
there
stood
a
venerable
old
man
in
a
purple
skull
cap
with
a
beard
like
white
floss
silk
looking
at
them
with
a
kind
though
feeble
smile
happy
youth
said
he
that
can
heat
itself
over
such
they
all
fell
on
their
knees
it
was
the
pope
nay
rise
my
children
said
he
almost
peevishly
i
came
not
into
this
corner
to
be
in
state
how
goes
plutarch
gerard
brought
his
work
and
kneeling
on
one
knee
presented
it
to
his
holiness
who
had
seated
himself
the
others
standing
his
holiness
inspected
it
with
interest
is
excellently
writ
said
he
gerard
heart
beat
with
delight
ah
this
plutarch
he
had
a
wondrous
art
francesco
how
each
character
standeth
out
alive
on
his
page
how
full
of
nature
each
yet
how
unlike
his
fellow
jacques
bonaventura
give
me
the
signor
his
holiness
an
excellent
narrator
capitano
and
writeth
exquisite
italian
but
in
spirit
a
thought
too
monotonous
monks
and
nuns
were
never
all
unchaste
one
or
two
such
stories
were
right
pleasant
and
diverting
but
five
score
paint
his
time
falsely
and
sadden
the
heart
of
such
as
love
mankind
moreover
he
hath
no
skill
at
characters
now
this
greek
is
supreme
in
that
great
art
he
carveth
them
with
pen
and
turning
his
page
see
into
how
real
and
great
a
world
we
enter
of
war
and
policy
and
business
and
love
in
its
own
place
for
with
him
as
in
the
great
world
men
are
not
all
running
after
a
wench
with
this
great
open
field
compare
me
not
the
narrow
garden
of
boccaccio
and
his
little
of
dishonest
your
holiness
they
say
hath
not
disdained
to
write
a
my
holiness
hath
done
more
foolish
things
than
one
whereof
it
repents
too
late
when
i
wrote
novels
i
little
thought
to
be
head
of
the
i
search
in
vain
for
a
copy
of
it
to
add
to
my
poor
it
is
well
then
the
strict
orders
i
gave
four
years
ago
to
destroy
every
copy
in
italy
have
been
well
discharged
however
for
your
comfort
on
my
being
made
pope
some
fool
turned
it
into
french
so
that
you
may
read
it
at
the
price
of
reduced
to
this
strait
we
throw
ourselves
on
your
generosity
vouchsafe
to
give
us
your
infallible
judgment
on
it
gently
gently
good
francesco
a
pope
novels
are
not
matters
of
faith
i
can
but
give
you
my
sincere
impression
well
then
the
work
in
question
had
as
far
as
i
can
remember
all
the
vices
of
boccaccio
without
his
choice
fra
colonna
your
holiness
is
known
for
slighting
aeneas
silvius
as
other
men
never
slighted
him
i
did
him
injustice
to
make
you
his
judge
perhaps
your
holiness
will
decide
more
justly
between
these
two
blessing
the
the
pope
demurred
in
speaking
of
plutarch
he
had
brightened
up
for
a
moment
and
his
eye
had
even
flashed
but
his
general
manner
was
as
unlike
what
youthful
females
expect
in
a
pope
as
you
can
conceive
i
can
only
describe
it
in
french
le
gentilhomme
blase
a
highbred
and
highly
cultivated
gentleman
who
had
done
and
said
and
seen
and
known
everything
and
whose
body
was
nearly
worn
out
but
double
languor
seemed
to
seize
him
at
the
father
proposal
my
poor
francesco
said
he
bethink
thee
that
i
have
had
a
life
of
controversy
and
am
sick
o
sick
as
death
plutarch
drew
me
to
this
calm
retreat
not
nay
but
your
holiness
for
moderating
of
strife
between
two
hot
young
bloods
makarioi
oi
eirinopioi
and
know
you
nature
so
ill
as
to
think
either
of
these
youths
will
reck
what
a
poor
old
pope
saith
oh
your
holiness
broke
in
gerard
blushing
and
gasping
sure
here
is
one
who
will
treasure
your
words
all
his
life
as
words
from
in
that
case
said
the
pope
i
am
fairly
caught
as
francesco
here
would
say
ouk
estin
ostis
est
anyr
eleutheos
i
came
to
taste
that
eloquent
heathen
dear
to
me
as
to
thee
thou
paynim
monk
and
i
must
talk
divinity
or
something
next
door
to
it
but
the
youth
hath
a
good
and
a
winning
face
and
writeth
greek
like
an
angel
well
then
my
children
to
comprehend
the
ways
of
the
church
we
should
still
rise
a
little
above
the
earth
since
the
church
is
between
heaven
and
earth
and
interprets
betwixt
them
the
question
is
then
not
how
vulgar
men
feel
but
how
the
common
creator
of
man
and
beast
doth
feel
towards
the
lower
animals
this
if
we
are
too
proud
to
search
for
it
in
the
lessons
of
the
church
the
next
best
thing
is
to
go
to
the
most
ancient
history
of
men
and
colonna
nay
nay
in
this
matter
herodotus
is
but
a
mushroom
finely
were
we
sped
for
ancient
history
if
we
depended
on
your
greeks
who
did
but
write
on
the
last
leaf
of
that
great
book
the
friar
groaned
here
was
a
pope
uttering
heresy
against
his
demigods
is
the
vulgate
i
speak
of
a
history
that
handles
matters
three
thousand
years
before
him
pedants
call
father
of
history
colonna
oh
the
vulgate
i
cry
your
holiness
mercy
how
you
frightened
me
i
quite
forgot
the
forgot
it
art
sure
thou
ever
readst
it
francesco
mio
not
quite
your
holiness
is
a
pleasure
i
have
long
promised
myself
the
first
vacant
moment
hitherto
these
grand
old
heathen
have
left
me
small
time
for
his
holiness
first
then
you
will
find
in
genesis
that
god
having
created
the
animals
drew
a
holy
pleasure
undefinable
by
us
from
contemplating
of
their
beauty
was
it
wonderful
see
their
myriad
forms
their
lovely
hair
and
eyes
their
grace
and
of
some
the
power
and
majesty
the
colour
of
others
brighter
than
roses
or
rubies
and
when
for
man
sin
not
their
own
they
were
destroyed
yet
were
two
of
each
kind
spared
and
when
the
ark
and
its
trembling
inmates
tumbled
solitary
on
the
world
of
water
then
saith
the
word
remembered
noah
and
the
cattle
that
were
with
him
in
the
ark
thereafter
god
did
write
his
rainbow
in
the
sky
as
a
bond
that
earth
should
be
flooded
no
more
and
between
whom
the
bond
between
god
and
man
nay
between
god
and
man
and
every
living
creature
of
all
flesh
or
my
memory
fails
me
with
age
in
exodus
god
commanded
that
the
cattle
should
share
the
sweet
blessing
of
the
one
day
rest
moreover
he
to
muzzle
the
ox
that
trod
out
the
corn
let
the
poor
overwrought
soul
snatch
a
mouthful
as
he
goes
his
toilsome
round
the
bulk
of
the
grain
shall
still
be
for
man
ye
will
object
perchance
that
paul
commenting
this
saith
rudely
god
care
for
oxen
verily
had
i
been
peter
instead
of
the
humblest
of
his
successors
i
had
answered
him
thy
theatrical
poets
paul
and
read
the
scriptures
then
shalt
thou
know
whether
god
careth
only
for
men
and
sparrows
or
for
all
his
creatures
o
paul
had
i
made
bold
to
say
not
to
learn
god
by
looking
into
paul
heart
nor
any
heart
of
man
but
study
that
which
he
hath
revealed
concerning
himself
thrice
he
forbade
the
jews
to
boil
the
kid
in
his
mother
milk
not
that
this
is
cruelty
but
want
of
thought
and
gentle
sentiments
and
so
paves
the
way
for
downright
cruelty
a
prophet
riding
on
an
ass
did
meet
an
angel
which
of
these
two
paulo
judice
had
seen
the
heavenly
spirit
marry
the
prophet
but
it
was
not
so
the
man
his
vision
cloyed
with
sin
saw
nought
the
poor
despised
creature
saw
all
nor
is
this
recorded
as
miraculous
poor
proud
things
we
overrate
ourselves
the
angel
had
slain
the
prophet
and
spared
the
ass
but
for
that
creature
clearer
vision
of
essences
divine
he
said
so
methinks
but
in
sooth
i
read
it
many
years
agone
why
did
god
spare
repentant
nineveh
because
in
that
city
were
sixty
thousand
children
besides
much
cattle
profane
history
and
vulgar
experience
add
their
mite
of
witness
the
cruel
to
animals
end
in
cruelty
to
man
and
strange
and
violent
deaths
marked
with
retribution
bloody
finger
have
in
all
ages
fallen
from
heaven
on
such
as
wantonly
harm
innocent
beasts
this
i
myself
have
seen
all
this
duly
weighed
and
seeing
that
despite
this
friends
the
stoics
who
in
their
vanity
say
the
creatures
all
subsist
for
man
comfort
there
be
snakes
and
scorpions
which
kill
terra
with
a
nip
musquitoes
which
eat
him
piecemeal
and
tigers
and
sharks
which
crack
him
like
an
almond
we
do
well
to
be
grateful
to
these
true
faithful
patient
friends
which
in
lieu
of
powdering
us
put
forth
their
strength
to
relieve
our
toils
and
do
feed
us
like
mothers
from
their
gentle
dugs
methinks
then
the
church
is
never
more
divine
than
in
this
benediction
of
our
friends
which
has
revolted
you
great
theological
authority
the
captain
of
the
pope
guards
since
here
she
inculcates
humility
and
gratitude
and
rises
towards
the
level
of
the
mind
divine
and
interprets
god
to
man
god
the
creator
parent
and
friend
of
man
and
beast
but
all
this
young
gentles
you
will
please
to
receive
not
as
delivered
by
the
pope
ex
cathedra
but
uttered
carelessly
in
a
free
hour
by
an
aged
clergyman
on
that
score
you
will
perhaps
do
well
to
entertain
it
with
some
little
consideration
for
old
age
must
surely
bring
a
man
somewhat
in
return
for
his
digestion
his
puerorum
ilia
eh
francesco
which
it
carries
such
was
the
purport
of
the
pope
discourse
but
the
manner
high
bred
languid
kindly
and
free
from
all
tone
of
dictation
he
seemed
to
be
gently
probing
the
matter
in
concert
with
his
hearers
not
playing
sir
oracle
at
the
bottom
of
all
which
was
doubtless
a
slight
touch
of
humbug
but
the
humbug
that
embellishes
life
and
all
sense
of
it
was
lost
in
the
subtle
italian
grace
of
the
thing
i
seem
to
hear
the
oracle
of
delphi
said
fra
colonna
enthusiastically
i
call
that
good
sense
shouted
jacques
bonaventura
oh
captain
good
sense
said
gerard
with
a
deep
and
tender
reproach
the
pope
smiled
on
gerard
cavil
not
at
words
that
was
an
unheard
of
concession
from
a
rival
he
then
asked
for
all
work
and
took
it
away
in
his
hand
but
before
going
he
gently
pulled
fra
colonna
ear
and
asked
him
whether
he
remembered
when
they
were
together
and
robbed
the
virgin
by
the
roadside
of
the
money
dropped
into
her
box
you
took
a
flat
stick
and
applied
to
the
top
and
drew
the
money
out
through
the
chink
you
rogue
said
his
holiness
severely
to
every
signor
his
own
honour
replied
fra
colonna
it
was
your
holiness
good
wit
invented
the
manoeuvre
i
was
but
the
humble
it
is
well
doubtless
you
know
was
of
the
first
water
but
i
did
it
in
such
good
company
it
troubles
me
humph
i
have
not
even
that
poor
consolation
what
did
we
spend
it
in
dost
mind
can
your
holiness
ask
why
what
all
o
every
these
are
delightful
reminiscences
my
francesco
alas
i
am
getting
old
i
shall
not
be
here
long
and
i
am
sorry
for
it
for
thy
sake
they
will
go
and
burn
thee
when
i
am
gone
art
far
more
a
heretic
than
huss
whom
i
saw
burned
with
these
eyes
and
oh
he
died
like
a
ay
your
holiness
but
i
believe
in
the
pope
and
huss
did
fox
they
will
not
burn
thee
wood
is
too
dear
adieu
old
playmate
adieu
young
gentlemen
an
old
man
blessing
be
on
that
afternoon
the
pope
secretary
brought
gerard
a
little
bag
in
it
were
several
gold
pieces
he
added
them
to
his
store
margaret
seemed
nearer
and
nearer
for
some
time
past
too
it
appeared
as
if
the
fairies
had
watched
over
him
baskets
of
choice
provisions
and
fruits
were
brought
to
his
door
by
porters
who
knew
not
who
had
employed
them
or
affected
ignorance
and
one
day
came
a
jewel
in
a
letter
but
no
words
chapter
lxi
the
princess
claelia
ordered
a
portrait
of
herself
gerard
advised
her
to
employ
his
friend
pietro
vanucci
but
she
declined
be
time
to
put
a
slight
on
the
gerardo
when
his
work
discontents
then
gerard
who
knew
he
was
an
excellent
draughtsman
but
not
so
good
a
colourist
begged
her
to
stand
to
him
as
a
roman
statue
he
showed
her
how
closely
he
could
mimic
marble
on
paper
she
consented
at
first
but
demurred
when
this
enthusiast
explained
to
her
that
she
must
wear
the
tunic
toga
and
sandals
of
the
ancients
why
i
had
as
lieve
be
presented
in
my
smock
said
she
with
mediaeval
frankness
alack
signorina
said
gerard
you
have
surely
never
noted
the
ancient
habit
so
free
so
ample
so
simple
yet
so
noble
and
most
becoming
your
highness
to
whom
heaven
hath
given
the
roman
features
and
eke
a
shapely
arm
and
hand
his
in
modern
what
can
you
flatter
like
the
rest
gerardo
well
give
me
time
to
think
o
come
o
saturday
and
then
i
will
say
ay
or
the
respite
thus
gained
was
passed
in
making
the
tunic
and
toga
and
trying
them
on
in
her
chamber
to
see
whether
they
suited
her
style
of
beauty
well
enough
to
compensate
their
being
a
thousand
years
out
of
date
gerard
hurrying
along
to
this
interview
was
suddenly
arrested
and
rooted
to
earth
at
a
shop
window
his
quick
eye
had
discerned
in
that
window
a
copy
of
lactantius
lying
open
that
is
fairly
writ
anyway
thought
he
he
eyed
it
a
moment
more
with
all
his
eyes
it
was
not
written
at
all
it
was
printed
gerard
groaned
i
am
sped
mine
enemy
is
at
the
door
the
press
is
in
he
went
into
the
shop
and
affecting
nonchalance
inquired
how
long
the
had
been
in
rome
the
man
said
he
believed
there
was
no
such
thing
in
the
city
oh
the
lactantius
that
was
printed
on
the
top
of
the
what
did
the
fall
down
there
out
o
the
moon
nay
messer
said
the
trader
laughing
it
shot
up
there
out
of
germany
see
the
gerard
took
the
lactantius
eagerly
and
saw
the
following
opera
et
impensis
sweynheim
et
pannartz
alumnorum
joannis
fust
impressum
subiacis
will
ye
buy
messer
see
how
fair
and
even
be
the
letters
few
are
left
can
write
like
that
and
scarce
a
quarter
of
the
i
would
fain
have
it
said
gerard
sadly
but
my
heart
will
not
let
me
know
that
i
am
a
caligraph
and
these
disciples
of
fust
run
after
me
round
the
world
the
bread
out
of
my
mouth
but
i
wish
them
no
ill
heaven
forbid
and
he
hurried
from
the
shop
dear
margaret
said
he
to
himself
we
must
lose
no
time
we
must
make
our
hay
while
shines
the
sun
one
month
more
and
an
avalanche
of
printer
type
shall
roll
down
on
rome
from
those
apennines
and
lay
us
waste
that
writers
and
he
almost
ran
to
the
princess
claelia
he
was
ushered
into
an
apartment
new
to
him
it
was
not
very
large
but
most
luxurious
a
fountain
played
in
the
centre
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
the
skins
of
panthers
dressed
with
the
hair
so
that
no
footfall
could
be
heard
the
room
was
an
to
the
boudoir
for
on
one
side
there
was
no
door
but
an
ample
curtain
of
gorgeous
tapestry
here
gerard
was
left
alone
till
he
became
quite
uneasy
and
doubted
whether
the
maid
had
not
shown
him
to
the
wrong
place
these
doubts
were
agreeably
dissipated
a
light
step
came
swiftly
behind
the
curtain
it
parted
in
the
middle
and
there
stood
a
figure
the
heathens
might
have
worshipped
it
was
not
quite
venus
nor
quite
minerva
but
between
the
two
nobler
than
venus
more
womanly
than
jupiter
daughter
toga
tunic
sandals
nothing
was
modern
and
as
for
beauty
that
is
of
all
times
gerard
started
up
and
all
the
artist
in
him
flushed
with
pleasure
oh
he
cried
innocently
and
gazed
in
rapture
this
added
the
last
charm
to
his
model
a
light
blush
tinted
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
brightened
and
her
mouth
smiled
with
delicious
complacency
at
this
genuine
tribute
to
her
charms
when
they
had
looked
at
one
another
so
some
time
and
she
saw
eloquence
was
confined
to
ejaculating
and
gazing
she
spoke
well
gerardo
thou
seest
i
have
made
myself
an
antique
monster
for
a
monster
i
doubt
fra
colonna
would
fall
down
and
adore
your
highness
seeing
you
so
nay
i
care
not
to
be
adored
by
an
old
man
i
would
liever
be
loved
by
a
young
one
of
my
own
gerard
took
out
his
pencils
arranged
his
canvas
which
he
had
covered
with
stout
paper
and
set
to
work
and
so
absorbed
was
he
that
he
had
no
mercy
on
his
model
at
last
after
near
an
hour
in
one
posture
gerardo
said
she
faintly
i
can
stand
so
no
more
even
for
sit
down
and
rest
awhile
i
thank
thee
said
she
and
sinking
into
a
chair
turned
pale
and
sighed
gerard
was
alarmed
and
saw
also
he
had
been
inconsiderate
he
took
water
from
the
fountain
and
was
about
to
throw
it
in
her
face
but
she
put
up
a
white
hand
deprecatingly
nay
hold
it
to
my
brow
with
thine
hand
prithee
do
not
fling
it
at
me
gerard
timidly
and
hesitating
applied
his
wet
hand
to
her
brow
ah
she
sighed
that
is
reviving
he
applied
it
again
she
thanked
him
and
asked
him
to
ring
a
little
on
the
table
he
did
so
and
a
maid
came
and
was
sent
to
floretta
with
orders
to
bring
a
large
fan
floretta
speedily
came
with
the
fan
she
no
sooner
came
near
the
princess
than
that
lady
highbred
nostrils
suddenly
expanded
like
a
bloodhorse
wretch
said
she
and
rising
up
with
a
sudden
return
to
vigour
seized
floretta
with
her
left
hand
twisted
it
in
her
hair
and
with
the
right
hand
boxed
her
ears
severely
three
times
floretta
screamed
and
blubbered
but
obtained
no
mercy
the
antique
toga
left
quite
disengaged
a
bare
arm
that
now
seemed
as
powerful
as
it
was
beautiful
it
rose
and
fell
like
the
piston
of
a
modern
and
heavy
slaps
resounded
one
after
another
on
floretta
shoulders
the
last
one
drove
her
sobbing
and
screaming
through
the
curtain
and
there
she
was
heard
crying
bitterly
for
some
time
after
saints
of
heaven
cried
gerard
what
is
amiss
what
has
she
done
she
knows
right
well
is
not
the
first
time
the
nasty
toad
learn
her
to
come
to
me
stinking
of
the
alas
signora
was
a
small
fault
a
small
fault
nay
was
a
foul
she
added
with
an
amazing
sudden
descent
to
humility
and
sweetness
are
you
wroth
with
me
for
beating
her
signora
it
ill
becomes
me
to
school
you
but
methinks
such
as
heaven
appoints
to
govern
others
should
govern
that
is
true
gerardo
how
wise
you
are
to
be
so
she
then
called
the
other
maid
and
gave
her
a
little
purse
take
that
to
floretta
and
tell
her
gerardo
hath
interceded
for
her
and
so
i
must
needs
forgive
her
there
gerard
coloured
all
over
at
the
compliment
but
not
knowing
how
to
turn
a
phrase
equal
to
the
occasion
asked
her
if
he
should
resume
her
picture
not
yet
beating
that
hussy
hath
somewhat
breathed
me
i
sit
awhile
and
you
shall
talk
to
me
i
know
you
can
talk
an
it
pleases
you
as
rarely
as
you
that
were
easily
done
do
it
then
gerard
was
taken
aback
but
signora
i
know
not
what
to
say
this
is
say
your
real
mind
say
you
wish
you
were
anywhere
but
nay
signora
that
would
not
be
sooth
i
wish
one
thing
ay
and
what
is
that
said
she
gently
i
wish
i
could
have
drawn
you
as
you
were
beating
that
poor
lass
you
were
awful
yet
lovely
oh
what
a
subject
for
a
pythoness
alas
he
thinks
but
of
his
art
and
why
keep
such
a
coil
about
my
beauty
gerardo
you
are
far
fairer
than
i
am
you
are
more
like
apollo
than
i
to
venus
also
you
have
lovely
hair
and
lovely
eyes
but
you
know
not
what
to
do
with
ay
do
i
to
draw
you
ah
yes
you
can
see
my
features
with
them
but
you
can
not
see
what
any
roman
gallant
had
seen
long
ago
in
your
place
yet
sure
you
must
have
noted
how
welcome
you
are
to
me
gerardo
i
can
see
your
highness
is
always
passing
kind
to
me
a
poor
stranger
like
no
i
am
not
gerardo
i
have
often
been
cold
to
you
rude
sometimes
and
you
are
so
simple
you
see
not
the
cause
alas
i
feared
for
my
own
heart
i
feared
to
be
your
slave
i
who
have
hitherto
made
slaves
ah
gerardo
i
am
unhappy
ever
since
you
came
here
i
have
lived
upon
your
visits
the
day
you
are
to
come
i
am
bright
the
other
days
i
am
listless
and
wish
them
fled
you
are
not
like
the
roman
gallants
you
make
me
hate
them
you
are
ten
times
braver
to
my
eye
and
you
are
wise
and
scholarly
and
never
flatter
and
lie
i
scorn
a
man
that
lies
teach
me
thy
magic
teach
me
to
make
thee
as
happy
by
my
side
as
i
am
still
by
as
she
poured
out
these
strange
words
the
princess
mellow
voice
sunk
almost
to
a
whisper
and
trembled
with
passion
and
her
white
hand
stole
timidly
yet
earnestly
down
gerard
arm
till
it
rested
like
a
soft
bird
upon
his
wrist
and
as
ready
to
fly
away
at
a
word
destitute
of
vanity
and
experience
wrapped
up
in
his
margaret
and
his
art
gerard
had
not
seen
this
revelation
coming
though
it
had
come
by
regular
and
visible
gradations
he
blushed
all
over
his
innocent
admiration
of
the
regal
beauty
that
besieged
him
did
not
for
a
moment
displace
the
absent
margaret
image
yet
it
was
regal
beauty
and
wooing
with
a
grace
and
tenderness
he
had
never
even
figured
in
imagination
how
to
check
her
without
wounding
her
he
blushed
and
trembled
the
siren
saw
and
encouraged
him
poor
gerardo
she
murmured
fear
not
none
shall
ever
harm
thee
under
my
wing
wilt
not
speak
to
me
mio
signora
muttered
gerard
deprecatingly
at
this
moment
his
eye
lowered
in
his
confusion
fell
on
the
shapely
white
arm
and
delicate
hand
that
curled
round
his
elbow
like
a
tender
vine
and
it
flashed
across
him
how
he
had
just
seen
that
lovely
limb
employed
on
floretta
he
trembled
and
blushed
alas
said
the
princess
i
scare
him
am
i
then
so
very
terrible
is
it
my
roman
robe
i
doff
it
and
habit
me
as
when
thou
first
camest
to
me
mindest
thou
was
to
write
a
letter
to
yon
barren
knight
ercole
shall
i
tell
thee
was
the
sight
of
thee
and
thy
pretty
ways
and
thy
wise
words
made
me
hate
him
on
the
instant
i
liked
the
fool
well
enough
before
or
wist
i
liked
him
tell
me
now
how
many
times
hast
thou
been
here
since
then
ah
thou
knowest
not
lovest
me
not
i
doubt
as
i
love
thee
eighteen
times
gerardo
and
each
time
dearer
to
me
the
day
thou
comest
not
is
night
not
day
to
claelia
alas
i
speak
for
both
cruel
boy
am
i
not
worth
a
word
hast
every
day
a
princess
at
thy
feet
nay
prithee
prithee
speak
to
me
signora
faltered
gerard
what
can
i
say
that
were
not
better
left
unsaid
oh
evil
day
that
ever
i
came
ah
say
not
so
was
the
brightest
day
ever
shone
on
me
or
indeed
on
thee
i
make
thee
confess
so
much
ere
long
ungrateful
your
highness
began
gerard
in
a
low
pleading
voice
call
me
claelia
signora
i
am
too
young
and
too
little
wise
to
know
how
i
ought
to
speak
to
you
so
as
not
to
seem
blind
nor
yet
ungrateful
but
this
i
know
i
were
both
naught
and
ungrateful
and
the
worst
foe
you
had
did
i
take
advantage
of
this
mad
fancy
sure
some
ill
spirit
hath
had
leave
to
afflict
you
withal
for
is
all
unnatural
that
a
princess
adorned
with
every
grace
should
abase
her
affections
on
a
the
princess
withdrew
her
hand
slowly
from
gerard
wrist
yet
as
it
passed
lightly
over
his
arm
it
seemed
to
linger
a
moment
at
parting
you
fear
the
daggers
of
my
kinsmen
said
she
half
sadly
half
contemptuously
no
more
than
i
fear
the
bodkins
of
your
women
said
gerard
haughtily
but
i
fear
god
and
the
saints
and
my
own
the
truth
gerardo
the
truth
hypocrisy
sits
awkwardly
on
thee
princesses
while
they
are
young
are
not
despised
for
love
of
god
but
of
some
other
woman
tell
me
whom
thou
lovest
and
if
she
is
worthy
thee
i
will
forgive
no
she
in
italy
upon
my
ah
there
is
one
somewhere
then
where
where
in
holland
my
native
ah
marie
de
bourgoyne
is
fair
they
say
yet
she
is
but
a
princess
she
i
love
is
not
noble
she
is
as
i
am
nor
is
she
so
fair
as
thou
yet
is
she
fair
and
linked
to
my
heart
for
ever
by
her
virtues
and
by
all
the
dangers
and
griefs
we
have
borne
together
and
for
one
another
forgive
me
but
i
would
not
wrong
my
margaret
for
all
the
highest
dames
in
the
slighted
beauty
started
to
her
feet
and
stood
opposite
him
as
beautiful
but
far
more
terrible
than
when
she
slapped
floretta
for
then
her
cheeks
were
red
but
now
they
were
pale
and
her
eyes
full
of
concentrated
fury
this
to
my
face
unmannered
wretch
she
cried
was
i
born
to
be
insulted
as
well
as
scorned
by
such
as
thou
beware
we
nobles
brook
no
rivals
bethink
thee
whether
is
better
the
love
of
a
cesarini
or
her
hate
for
after
all
i
have
said
and
done
to
thee
it
must
be
love
or
hate
between
us
and
to
the
death
choose
now
he
looked
up
at
her
with
wonder
and
awe
as
she
stood
towering
over
him
in
her
roman
toga
offering
this
strange
alternative
he
seemed
to
have
affronted
a
goddess
of
antiquity
he
a
poor
puny
mortal
he
sighed
deeply
but
spoke
not
perhaps
something
in
his
deep
and
patient
sigh
touched
a
tender
chord
in
that
ungoverned
creature
or
perhaps
the
time
had
come
for
one
passion
to
ebb
and
another
to
flow
the
princess
sank
languidly
into
a
seat
and
the
tears
began
to
steal
rapidly
down
her
cheeks
alas
alas
said
gerard
weep
not
sweet
lady
your
tears
they
do
accuse
me
and
i
am
like
to
weep
for
company
my
kind
patron
be
yourself
you
will
live
to
see
how
much
better
a
friend
i
was
to
you
than
i
i
see
it
now
gerardo
said
the
princess
friend
is
the
word
the
only
word
can
ever
pass
between
us
twain
i
was
mad
any
other
man
had
advantage
of
my
folly
you
must
teach
me
to
be
your
friend
and
nothing
gerard
hailed
this
proposition
with
joy
and
told
her
out
of
cicero
how
godlike
a
thing
was
friendship
and
how
much
better
and
rarer
and
more
lasting
than
love
to
prove
to
her
he
was
capable
of
it
he
even
told
her
about
denys
and
himself
she
listened
with
her
eyes
half
shut
watching
his
words
to
fathom
his
character
and
learn
his
weak
point
at
last
she
addressed
him
calmly
thus
leave
me
now
gerardo
and
come
as
usual
you
will
find
your
lesson
well
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
he
kissed
it
and
went
away
pondering
deeply
this
strange
interview
and
wondering
whether
he
had
done
prudently
or
not
the
next
day
he
was
received
with
marked
distance
and
the
princess
stood
before
him
literally
like
a
statue
and
after
a
very
short
sitting
excused
herself
and
dismissed
him
gerard
felt
the
chilling
difference
but
said
to
himself
she
is
so
she
was
in
her
way
the
next
day
he
found
the
princess
waiting
for
him
surrounded
by
young
nobles
flattering
her
to
the
skies
she
and
they
treated
him
like
a
dog
that
could
do
one
little
trick
they
could
not
the
cavaliers
in
particular
criticised
his
work
with
a
mass
of
ignorance
and
insolence
combined
that
made
his
cheeks
burn
the
princess
watched
his
face
demurely
with
eyes
at
each
sting
the
insects
gave
him
and
when
they
had
fled
had
her
doors
closed
against
every
one
of
them
for
their
pains
the
next
day
gerard
found
her
alone
cold
and
silent
after
standing
to
him
so
some
time
she
said
you
treated
my
company
with
less
respect
than
became
did
i
signora
did
you
you
fired
up
at
the
comments
they
did
you
the
honour
to
make
on
your
nay
i
said
nought
observed
gerard
oh
high
looks
speak
as
plain
as
high
words
your
cheeks
were
red
as
i
was
nettled
a
moment
at
seeing
so
much
ignorance
and
now
it
is
me
their
hostess
you
forgive
me
signora
and
acquit
me
of
design
it
would
ill
become
me
to
affront
the
kindest
patron
and
friend
i
have
in
rome
but
how
humble
we
are
all
of
a
sudden
in
sooth
ser
gerardo
you
are
a
capital
feigner
you
can
insult
or
truckle
at
truckle
to
whom
to
me
for
one
to
one
whom
you
affronted
for
a
girl
like
yourself
but
whose
patronage
you
claim
all
the
gerard
rose
and
put
his
hand
to
his
heart
these
are
biting
words
signora
have
i
really
deserved
them
oh
what
are
words
to
an
adventurer
like
you
cold
steel
is
all
you
fear
i
am
no
swashbuckler
yet
i
have
met
steel
with
steel
and
methinks
i
had
rather
face
your
kinsmen
swords
than
your
cruel
tongue
lady
why
do
you
use
me
so
for
no
good
reason
but
because
i
am
wayward
and
shrewish
and
curst
and
because
everybody
admires
me
but
i
admire
you
too
signora
your
friends
may
flatter
you
more
but
believe
me
they
have
not
the
eye
to
see
half
your
charms
their
babble
yesterday
showed
me
that
none
admire
you
more
truly
or
wish
you
better
than
the
poor
artist
who
might
not
be
your
lover
but
hoped
to
be
your
friend
but
no
i
see
that
may
not
be
between
one
so
high
as
you
and
one
so
low
as
ay
but
it
shall
gerardo
said
the
princess
eagerly
i
will
not
be
so
curst
tell
me
now
where
abides
thy
margaret
and
i
will
give
thee
a
present
for
her
and
on
that
you
and
i
will
be
she
is
a
daughter
of
a
physician
called
peter
and
they
bide
at
sevenbergen
ah
me
shall
i
see
it
again
is
well
now
and
she
dismissed
him
somewhat
abruptly
poor
gerard
he
began
to
wade
in
deep
waters
when
he
encountered
this
italian
princess
callida
et
calida
selis
filia
he
resolved
to
go
no
more
when
once
he
had
finished
her
likeness
indeed
he
now
regretted
having
undertaken
so
long
and
laborious
a
task
this
resolution
was
shaken
for
a
moment
by
his
next
reception
which
was
all
gentleness
and
kindness
after
standing
to
him
some
time
in
her
toga
she
said
she
was
fatigued
and
wanted
his
assistance
in
another
way
would
he
teach
her
to
draw
a
little
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
taught
her
to
make
easy
lines
he
found
her
wonderfully
apt
he
said
so
i
had
a
teacher
before
thee
ay
and
one
as
handsome
as
she
then
went
to
a
drawer
and
brought
out
several
heads
drawn
with
a
complete
ignorance
of
the
art
but
with
great
patience
and
natural
talent
they
were
all
heads
of
gerard
and
full
of
spirit
and
really
not
unlike
one
was
his
very
image
there
said
she
now
thou
seest
who
was
my
not
i
what
know
you
not
who
teaches
us
women
to
do
all
things
is
love
love
made
me
draw
because
thou
draweth
love
prints
thine
image
in
my
bosom
my
fingers
touch
the
pen
and
love
supplies
the
want
of
art
and
lo
thy
beloved
features
lie
upon
the
gerard
opened
his
eyes
with
astonishment
at
this
return
to
an
interdicted
topic
oh
signora
you
promised
me
to
be
friends
and
nothing
she
laughed
in
his
face
how
simple
you
are
who
believes
a
woman
promising
nonsense
impossibilities
friendship
foolish
boy
who
ever
built
that
temple
on
red
ashes
nay
gerardo
she
added
gloomily
between
thee
and
me
it
must
be
love
or
which
you
will
signora
said
gerard
firmly
but
for
me
i
will
neither
love
nor
hate
you
but
with
your
permission
i
will
leave
and
he
rose
abruptly
she
rose
too
pale
as
death
and
said
ere
thou
leavest
me
so
know
thy
fate
outside
that
door
are
armed
men
who
wait
to
slay
thee
at
a
word
from
but
you
will
not
speak
that
word
that
word
i

over
thy
she
ended
in
a
little
scream
for
gerard
threw
himself
in
a
moment
at
her
feet
and
poured
out
in
one
torrent
of
eloquence
the
story
of
his
love
and
margaret
how
he
had
been
imprisoned
hunted
with
bloodhounds
for
her
driven
to
exile
for
her
how
she
had
shed
her
blood
for
him
and
now
pined
at
home
how
he
had
walked
through
europe
environed
by
perils
torn
by
savage
brutes
attacked
by
furious
men
with
sword
and
axe
and
trap
robbed
shipwrecked
for
her
the
princess
trembled
and
tried
to
get
away
from
him
but
he
held
her
robe
he
clung
to
her
he
made
her
hear
his
pitiful
story
and
margaret
he
caught
her
hand
and
clasped
it
between
both
his
and
his
tears
fell
fast
on
her
hand
as
he
implored
her
to
think
on
all
the
woes
of
the
true
lovers
she
would
part
and
what
but
remorse
swift
and
lasting
could
come
of
so
deep
a
love
betrayed
and
so
false
a
love
feigned
with
mutual
hatred
lurking
at
the
bottom
in
such
moments
none
ever
resisted
gerard
the
princess
after
in
vain
trying
to
get
away
from
him
for
she
felt
his
power
over
her
began
to
waver
and
sigh
and
her
bosom
to
rise
and
fall
tumultuously
and
her
fiery
eyes
to
fill
you
conquer
me
she
sobbed
you
or
my
better
angel
leave
rome
i
will
i
if
you
breathe
a
word
of
my
folly
it
will
be
your
think
not
so
poorly
of
me
you
are
my
benefactress
once
more
is
it
for
me
to
slander
you

i
will
send

the
means

know
myself
if
you
cross
my
path
again
i
shall
kill
you
addio
my
heart
is
she
touched
her
bell
floretta
said
she
in
a
choked
voice
take
him
safe
out
of
the
house
through
my
chamber
and
by
the
side
he
turned
at
the
door
she
was
leaning
with
one
hand
on
a
chair
crying
with
averted
head
then
he
thought
only
of
her
kindness
and
ran
back
and
kissed
her
robe
she
never
moved
once
clear
of
the
house
he
darted
home
thanking
heaven
for
his
escape
soul
and
body
landlady
said
he
there
is
one
would
pick
a
quarrel
with
me
what
is
to
be
done
strike
him
first
and
at
vantage
get
behind
him
and
then
alas
i
lack
your
italian
courage
to
be
serious
is
a
oh
holy
saints
that
is
another
matter
change
thy
lodging
awhile
and
keep
snug
and
alter
the
fashion
of
thy
she
then
took
him
to
her
own
niece
who
let
lodgings
at
some
little
distance
and
installed
him
there
he
had
little
to
do
now
and
no
princess
to
draw
so
he
set
himself
resolutely
to
read
that
deed
of
floris
brandt
from
which
he
had
hitherto
been
driven
by
the
abominably
bad
writing
he
mastered
it
and
saw
at
once
that
the
loan
on
this
land
must
have
been
paid
over
and
over
again
by
the
rents
and
that
ghysbrecht
was
keeping
peter
brandt
out
of
his
own
fool
not
to
have
read
this
before
he
cried
he
hired
a
horse
and
rode
down
to
the
nearest
port
a
vessel
was
to
sail
for
amsterdam
in
four
days
he
took
a
passage
and
paid
a
small
sum
to
secure
it
the
land
is
too
full
of
for
me
said
he
and
is
lovely
fair
weather
for
the
sea
our
dutch
skippers
are
not
shipwrecked
like
these
bungling
when
he
returned
home
there
sat
his
old
landlady
with
her
eyes
sparkling
you
are
in
luck
my
young
master
said
she
all
the
fish
run
to
your
net
this
day
methinks
see
what
a
lackey
hath
brought
to
our
house
this
bill
and
this
gerard
broke
the
seals
and
found
it
full
of
silver
crowns
the
letter
contained
a
mere
slip
of
paper
with
this
line
cut
out
of
some
la
lingua
non
ha
osso
ma
fa
rompere

said
gerard
aloud

he
fell
to
dancing
round
her

said
she

make
you

be

with
a
grating
laugh

a
pretty
letter
to
send
to
a
poor
fellow
so
far
from
home
but
it
is
reicht
heynes
i
blame
for
humouring
the
old
woman
and
letting
her
do
it
as
for
the
old
woman
herself
she
dotes
she
has
lost
her
head
she
is
fourscore
oh
my
heart
i
choking
for
all
that
she
ought
to
be
locked
up
or
her
hands
tied
say
this
had
come
to
a
fool
say
i
was
idiot
enough
to
believe
this
know
ye
what
i
should
do
run
to
the
top
of
the
highest
church
tower
in
rome
and
fling
myself
off
it
cursing
heaven
woman
woman
what
are
you
doing
and
he
seized
her
rudely
by
the
shoulder
what
are
ye
weeping
for
he
cried
in
a
voice
all
unlike
his
own
and
loud
and
hoarse
as
a
raven
would
ye
scald
me
to
death
with
your
tears
she
believes
it
she
believes
it
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
then
there
is
no
the
poor
woman
sighed
and
rocked
herself
and
must
be
the
one
to
bring
it
thee
all
smiling
and
smirking
i
could
kill
myself
death
spares
none
she
sobbed
death
spares
gerard
staggered
against
the
window
sill
but
he
is
master
of
death
he
groaned
or
they
have
taught
me
a
lie
i
begin
to
fear
there
is
no
god
and
the
saints
are
but
dead
bones
and
hell
is
master
of
the
world
my
pretty
margaret
my
sweet
my
loving
margaret
the
best
daughter
the
truest
lover
the
pride
of
holland
the
darling
of
the
world
it
is
a
lie
where
is
this
caitiff
hans
i
hunt
him
round
the
town
i
cram
his
murdering
falsehood
down
his
and
he
seized
his
hat
and
ran
furiously
about
the
streets
for
hours
towards
sunset
he
came
back
white
as
a
ghost
he
had
not
found
memling
but
his
poor
mind
had
had
time
to
realise
the
woman
simple
words
that
death
spares
none
he
crept
into
the
house
bent
and
feeble
as
an
old
man
and
refused
all
food
nor
would
he
speak
but
sat
white
with
great
staring
eyes
muttering
at
intervals
there
is
no
alarmed
both
on
his
account
and
on
her
own
for
he
looked
a
desperate
maniac
his
landlady
ran
for
her
aunt
the
good
dame
came
and
the
two
women
braver
together
sat
one
on
each
side
of
him
and
tried
to
soothe
him
with
kind
and
consoling
voices
but
he
heeded
them
no
more
than
the
chairs
they
sat
on
then
the
younger
held
a
crucifix
out
before
him
to
aid
her
maria
mother
of
heaven
comfort
him
they
sighed
but
he
sat
glaring
deaf
to
all
external
sounds
presently
without
any
warning
he
jumped
up
struck
the
crucifix
rudely
out
of
his
way
with
a
curse
and
made
a
headlong
dash
at
the
door
the
poor
women
shrieked
but
ere
he
reached
the
door
something
seemed
to
them
to
draw
him
up
straight
by
his
hair
and
twirl
him
round
like
a
top
he
whirled
twice
round
with
arms
extended
then
fell
like
a
dead
log
upon
the
floor
with
blood
trickling
from
his
nostrils
and
ears
chapter
xlii
gerard
returned
to
consciousness
and
to
despair
on
the
second
day
he
was
raving
with
fever
on
the
brain
on
a
table
hard
by
lay
his
rich
auburn
hair
long
as
a
woman
the
deadlier
symptoms
succeeded
one
another
rapidly
on
the
fifth
day
his
leech
retired
and
gave
him
up
on
the
sunset
of
that
same
day
he
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
some
said
he
would
wake
only
to
die
but
an
old
gossip
whose
opinion
carried
weight
she
had
been
a
professional
nurse
declared
that
his
youth
might
save
him
yet
could
he
sleep
twelve
hours
on
this
his
old
landlady
cleared
the
room
and
watched
him
alone
she
vowed
a
wax
candle
to
the
virgin
for
every
hour
he
should
sleep
he
slept
twelve
hours
the
good
soul
rejoiced
and
thanked
the
virgin
on
her
knees
he
slept
hours
his
kind
nurse
began
to
doubt
at
the
thirtieth
hour
she
sent
for
the
woman
of
art
thirty
hours
shall
we
wake
him
the
other
inspected
him
closely
for
some
time
his
breath
is
even
his
hand
moist
i
know
there
be
learned
leeches
would
wake
him
to
look
at
his
tongue
and
be
none
the
wiser
but
we
that
be
women
should
have
the
sense
to
let
bon
nature
alone
when
did
sleep
ever
harm
the
racked
brain
or
the
torn
heart
when
he
had
been
hours
asleep
it
got
wind
and
they
had
much
ado
to
keep
the
curious
out
but
they
admitted
only
fra
colonna
and
his
friend
the
gigantic
fra
jerome
these
two
relieved
the
women
and
sat
silent
the
former
eyeing
his
young
friend
with
tears
in
his
eyes
the
latter
with
beads
in
his
hand
looked
as
calmly
on
him
as
he
had
on
the
sea
when
gerard
and
he
encountered
it
hand
to
hand
at
last
i
think
it
was
about
the
sixtieth
hour
of
this
strange
sleep
the
landlady
touched
fra
colonna
with
her
elbow
he
looked
gerard
had
opened
his
eyes
as
gently
as
if
he
had
been
but
dozing
he
stared
he
drew
himself
up
a
little
in
bed
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
and
found
his
hair
was
gone
he
noticed
his
friend
colonna
and
smiled
with
pleasure
but
in
the
middle
of
smiling
his
face
stopped
and
was
convulsed
in
a
moment
with
anguish
unspeakable
and
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
his
good
landlady
wept
at
this
she
had
known
what
it
is
to
awake
bereaved
fra
jerome
recited
canticles
and
prayers
from
his
breviary
gerard
rolled
himself
in
the
fra
colonna
went
to
him
and
whimpering
reminded
him
that
all
was
not
lost
the
divine
muses
were
immortal
he
must
transfer
his
affection
to
them
they
would
never
betray
him
nor
fail
him
like
creatures
of
clay
the
good
simple
father
then
hurried
away
for
he
was
overcome
by
his
emotion
fra
jerome
remained
behind
young
man
said
he
the
muses
exist
but
in
the
brains
of
pagans
and
visionaries
the
church
alone
gives
repose
to
the
heart
on
earth
and
happiness
to
the
soul
hereafter
hath
earth
deceived
thee
hath
passion
broken
thy
heart
after
tearing
it
the
church
opens
her
arms
consecrate
thy
gifts
to
her
the
church
is
peace
of
he
spoke
these
words
solemnly
at
the
door
and
was
gone
as
soon
as
they
were
uttered
the
church
cried
gerard
rising
furiously
and
shaking
his
fist
after
the
friar
malediction
on
the
church
but
for
the
church
i
should
not
lie
broken
here
and
she
lie
cold
cold
cold
in
holland
oh
my
margaret
oh
my
darling
my
darling
and
i
must
run
from
thee
the
few
months
thou
hadst
to
live
cruel
cruel
the
monsters
they
let
her
die
death
comes
not
without
some
signs
these
the
blind
selfish
wretches
saw
not
or
recked
not
but
i
had
seen
them
i
that
love
her
oh

i
been
there
i
had
saved
her
i
had
saved
her
idiot
idiot
to
leave

for
a
he
wept
bitterly
a
long
time
then
suddenly
bursting
into
rage
again
he
cried
vehemently
the
church
for
whose
sake
i
was
driven
from
her
my
malison
be
on
the
church
and
the
hypocrites
that

broken

and
whosoever
made
them
what
they
are
the
friar
did
not
hear
these
mad
and
wicked
words
but
only
the
yell
of
rage
with
which
they
were
flung
after
him
it
was
as
well
for
if
he
had
heard
them
he
would
have
had
his
late
shipmate
burned
in
the
forum
with
as
little
hesitation
as
he
would
have
roasted
a
kid
his
old
landlady
who
had
accompanied
fra
colonna
down
the
stair
heard
the
raised
voice
and
returned
in
some
anxiety
she
found
gerard
putting
on
his
clothes
and
crying
she
remonstrated
what
avails
my
lying
here
said
he
gloomily
can
i
find
here
that
which
i
seek
saints
preserve
us
is
he
distraught
again
what
seek
ye
oblivion
my
little
heart
oh
but
young
to
talk
young
or
old
what
else
have
i
to
live
for
he
put
on
his
best
clothes
the
good
dame
remonstrated
my
pretty
gerard
know
that
it
is
tuesday
not
oh
tuesday
is
it
i
thought
it
had
been
nay
thou
hast
slept
long
thou
never
wearest
thy
brave
clothes
on
working
days
what
i
did
when
she
lived
i
did
now
i
shall
do
whatever
erst
i
did
not
the
past
is
the
past
there
lies
my
hair
and
with
it
my
way
of
life
i
have
served
one
master
as
well
as
i
could
you
see
my
reward
now
i
serve
another
and
give
him
a
fair
trial
alas
sighed
the
woman
turning
pale
what
mean
these
dark
words
and
what
new
master
is
this
whose
service
thou
wouldst
try
and
with
this
horrible
declaration
on
his
lips
the
miserable
creature
walked
out
with
his
cap
and
feather
set
jauntily
on
one
side
and
feeble
limbs
and
a
sinister
face
pale
as
ashes
and
all
drawn
down
as
if
by
age
chapter
lxiii
a
dark
cloud
fell
on
a
noble
mind
his
pure
and
unrivalled
love
for
margaret
had
been
his
polar
star
it
was
quenched
and
he
drifted
on
the
gloomy
sea
of
no
hope
nor
was
he
a
prey
to
despair
alone
but
to
exasperation
at
all
his
fortitude
perils
virtue
wasted
and
worse
than
wasted
for
it
kept
burning
and
stinging
him
that
had
he
stayed
lazily
selfishly
at
home
he
should
have
saved
his
margaret
life
these
two
poisons
raging
together
in
his
young
blood
maddened
and
demoralized
him
he
rushed
fiercely
into
pleasure
and
in
those
days
even
more
than
now
pleasure
was
vice
wine
women
gambling
whatever
could
procure
him
an
hour
excitement
and
a
moment
oblivion
he
plunged
into
these
things
as
men
tired
of
life
have
rushed
among
the
enemy
bullets
the
large
sums
he
had
put
by
for
margaret
gave
him
ample
means
for
debauchery
and
he
was
soon
the
leader
of
those
loose
companions
he
had
hitherto
kept
at
a
distance
his
heart
deteriorated
along
with
his
morals
he
sulked
with
his
old
landlady
for
thrusting
gentle
advice
and
warning
on
him
and
finally
removed
to
another
part
of
the
town
to
be
clear
of
remonstrance
and
reminiscences
when
he
had
carried
this
game
on
some
time
his
hand
became
less
steady
and
he
could
no
longer
write
to
satisfy
himself
moreover
his
patience
declined
as
the
habits
of
pleasure
grew
on
him
so
he
gave
up
that
art
and
took
likenesses
in
colours
but
this
he
neglected
whenever
the
idle
rakes
his
companions
came
for
him
and
so
he
dived
in
foul
waters
seeking
that
sorry
oblivion
it
is
not
my
business
to
paint
at
full
length
the
scenes
of
coarse
vice
in
which
this
unhappy
young
man
now
played
a
part
but
it
is
my
business
to
impress
the
broad
truth
that
he
was
a
rake
a
debauchee
and
a
drunkard
and
one
of
the
wildest
loosest
and
wickedest
young
men
in
rome
they
are
no
lovers
of
truth
nor
of
mankind
who
conceal
or
slur
the
wickedness
of
the
good
and
so
by
their
want
of
candour
rob
despondent
sinners
of
hope
enough
the
man
was
not
born
to
do
things
by
halves
and
he
was
not
vicious
by
halves
his
humble
female
friends
often
gossiped
about
him
his
old
landlady
told
teresa
he
was
going
to
the
bad
and
prayed
her
to
try
and
find
out
where
he
was
teresa
told
her
husband
lodovico
his
sad
story
and
bade
him
look
about
and
see
if
he
could
discover
the
young
man
present
abode
shouldst
remember
his
face
lodovico
mio
teresa
a
man
in
my
way
of
life
never
forgets
a
face
least
of
all
a
benefactor
but
thou
knowest
i
seldom
go
abroad
by
teresa
sighed
and
how
long
is
it
to
be
so
lodovico
till
some
cavalier
passes
his
sword
through
me
they
will
not
let
a
poor
fellow
like
me
take
to
any
honest
pietro
vanucci
was
one
of
those
who
bear
prosperity
worse
than
adversity
having
been
ignominiously
ejected
for
late
hours
by
their
old
landlady
and
meeting
gerard
in
the
street
he
greeted
him
warmly
and
soon
after
took
up
his
quarters
in
the
same
house
he
brought
with
him
a
lad
called
andrea
who
ground
his
colours
and
was
his
pupil
and
also
his
model
being
a
youth
of
rare
beauty
and
as
sharp
as
a
needle
pietro
had
not
quite
forgotten
old
times
and
professed
a
warm
friendship
for
gerard
gerard
in
whom
all
warmth
of
sentiment
seemed
extinct
submitted
coldly
to
the
other
friendship
and
a
fine
acquaintance
it
was
this
pietro
was
not
only
a
libertine
but
half
a
misanthrope
and
an
open
infidel
and
so
they
ran
in
couples
with
mighty
little
in
common
o
rare
phenomenon
one
day
when
gerard
had
undermined
his
health
and
taken
the
bloom
off
his
beauty
and
run
through
most
of
his
money
vanucci
got
up
a
gay
party
to
mount
the
tiber
in
a
boat
drawn
by
buffaloes
lorenzo
medici
had
imported
these
creatures
into
florence
about
three
years
before
but
they
were
new
in
rome
and
nothing
would
content
this
beggar
on
horseback
vanucci
but
being
drawn
by
the
brutes
up
the
tiber
each
libertine
was
to
bring
a
lady
and
she
must
be
handsome
or
he
be
fined
but
the
one
that
should
contribute
the
loveliest
was
to
be
crowned
with
laurel
and
voted
a
public
benefactor
such
was
their
reading
of
vir
bonus
est
quis
they
got
a
splendid
galley
and
twelve
buffaloes
and
all
the
libertines
and
their
female
accomplices
assembled
by
degrees
at
the
place
of
embarkation
but
no
gerard
they
waited
for
him
some
time
at
first
patiently
then
impatiently
vanucci
excused
him
i
heard
him
say
he
had
forgotten
to
provide
himself
with
a
fardingale
comrades
the
good
lad
is
hunting
for
a
beauty
fit
to
take
rank
among
these
peerless
dames
consider
the
difficulty
ladies
and
be
patient
at
last
gerard
was
seen
at
some
distance
with
a
female
in
his
hand
she
is
long
enough
said
one
of
her
sex
criticising
her
from
afar
gemini
what
steps
she
takes
said
another
oh
it
is
wise
to
hurry
into
good
company
was
pietro
excuse
but
when
the
pair
came
up
satire
was
choked
gerard
companion
was
a
peerless
beauty
she
extinguished
the
as
stars
the
rising
sun
tall
but
not
too
tall
and
straight
as
a
dart
yet
supple
as
a
young
panther
her
face
a
perfect
oval
her
forehead
white
her
cheeks
a
rich
olive
with
the
eloquent
blood
mantling
below
and
her
glorious
eyes
fringed
with
long
thick
silken
eyelashes
that
seemed
made
to
sweep
up
sensitive
hearts
by
the
half
dozen
saucy
red
lips
and
teeth
of
the
whitest
ivory
the
women
were
visibly
depressed
by
this
wretched
sight
the
men
in
ecstasies
they
received
her
with
loud
shouts
and
waving
of
caps
and
one
enthusiast
even
went
down
on
his
knees
upon
the
boat
gunwale
and
hailed
her
of
origin
divine
but
his
chere
amie
pulling
his
hair
for
it
and
the
goddess
giving
him
a
little
kick
cotemporaneously
he
lay
supine
and
the
peerless
creature
frisked
over
his
body
without
deigning
him
a
look
and
took
her
seat
at
the
prow
pietro
vanucci
sat
in
a
sort
of
collapse
glaring
at
her
and
gaping
with
his
mouth
open
like
a
dying
the
drover
spoke
to
the
buffaloes
the
ropes
tightened
and
they
moved
up
stream
what
think
ye
of
this
new
beef
mesdames
we
saw
monsters
so
viley
with
their
nasty
horns
that
make
one
afeard
and
their
foul
nostrils
cast
up
into
the
air
holes
be
they
not
signorina
the
beeves
are
a
present
from
florence
the
beautiful
would
ye
look

i
the
nose
they
are
so
dull
objected
a
lively
lady
i
went
up
tiber
twice
as
fast
last
time
with
but
five
mules
and
an
nay
that
is
soon
mended
cried
a
gallant
and
jumping
ashore
he
drew
his
sword
and
despite
the
remonstrances
of
the
drivers
went
down
the
dozen
buffaloes
goading
them
they
snorted
and
whisked
their
tails
and
went
no
faster
at
which
the
laughed
loud
and
long
finally
he
goaded
a
patriarch
bull
who
turned
instantly
on
the
sword
sent
his
long
horns
clean
through
the
spark
and
with
a
furious
jerk
of
his
prodigious
neck
sent
him
flying
over
his
head
into
the
air
he
described
a
bold
parabola
and
fell
sitting
and
unconsciously
waving
his
glittering
blade
into
the
yellow
tiber
the
laughing
ladies
screamed
and
wrung
their
hands
all
but
gerard
fair
she
uttered
something
very
like
an
oath
and
seizing
the
helm
steered
the
boat
out
and
the
gallant
came
up
sputtering
griped
the
gunwale
and
was
drawn
in
dripping
he
glared
round
him
confusedly
i
understand
not
that
said
he
a
little
peevishly
puzzled
and
therefore
it
would
seem
discontented
at
which
finding
he
was
by
some
strange
accident
not
slain
his
doublet
being
perforated
instead
of
his
body
they
began
to
laugh
again
louder
than
ever
what
are
ye
cackling
at
remonstrated
the
spark
i
desire
to
know
how
is
that
one
moment
a
gentleman
is
out
yonder
a
pricking
of
african
beef
and
the
next
moment
gerard
lady
disporting
in
his
native
tell
him
not
a
soul
of
ye
cried
vanucci
let
him
find
out

confound
ye

i
might
puzzle
my
brains
till
doomsday
i
should
find
it
out
also
where
is
my

gerard
lady
ask
tiber
your
best
way
signor
will
be
to
do
it
over
again
and
in
a
word
keep
pricking
of
afric
beef
till
your
mind
receives
light
so
shall
you
comprehend
the
matter
by
degrees
as
lawyers
mount
heaven
and
buffaloes
here
a
chevalier
remarked
that
the
last
speaker
transcended
the
sons
of
adam
as
much
in
wit
as
she
did
the
daughters
of
eve
in
beauty
at
which
and
indeed
at
all
their
compliments
the
conduct
of
pietro
vanucci
was
peculiar
that
signor
had
left
off
staring
and
gaping
bewildered
and
now
sat
coiled
up
on
each
his
mouth
muffled
and
two
bright
eyes
fixed
on
the
lady
and
twinkling
and
scintillating
most
comically
he
did
not
appear
to
interest
or
amuse
her
in
return
her
glorious
eyes
and
eyelashes
swept
him
calmly
at
times
but
scarce
distinguished
him
from
the
benches
and
things
presently
the
unanimity
of
the
party
suffered
a
momentary
check
mortified
by
the
attention
the
cavaliers
paid
to
gerard
companion
the
ladies
began
to
pick
her
to
pieces
sotto
voce
and
audibly
the
lovely
girl
then
showed
that
if
rich
in
beauty
she
was
poor
in
feminine
tact
instead
of
revenging
herself
like
a
true
woman
through
the
men
she
permitted
herself
to
overhear
and
openly
retaliate
on
her
detractors
there
is
not
one
of
you
that
wears
nature
colours
said
she
look
here
and
she
pointed
rudely
in
one
face
this
is
the
beauty
that
is
to
be
bought
in
every
shop
here
is
cerussa
here
is
stibium
and
here
purpurissum
oh
i
know
the
articles
bless
you
i
use
them
every
day
but
not
on
my
face
no
thank
here
vanucci
eyes
twinkled
themselves
nearly
out
of
sight
why
your
lips
are
coloured
and
the
very
veins
in
your
forehead
not
a
charm
but
would
come
off
with
a
wet
towel
and
look
at
your
great
coarse
black
hair
like
a
horse
tail
drugged
and
stained
to
look
like
tow
and
then
your
bodies
are
as
false
as
your
heads
and
your
cheeks
and
your
hearts
i
trow
look
at
your
padded
bosoms
and
your
wooden
heeled
chopines
to
raise
your
little
stunted
limbs
up
and
deceive
the
world
skinny
dwarfs
ye
are
cushioned
and
stultified
into
great
fat
giants
aha
mesdames
well
is
it
said
of
you
grande
di
legni
grosse
di
straci
rosse
di
bettito
bianche
di
this
drew
out
a
rejoinder
avaunt
vulgar
toad
telling
the
men
everything
your
coarse
ruddy
cheeks
are
your
own
and
your
little
handful
of
african
hair
but
who
is
padded
more
why
you
are
shaped
like
a
ye
lie
oh
the
young
person
where
didst
pick
her
up
ser
gerard
hold
thy
peace
marcia
said
gerard
awakened
by
the
raised
trebles
from
a
gloomy
reverie
be
not
so
insolent
the
grave
shall
close
over
thy
beauty
as
it
hath
over
fairer
than
they
began
said
marcia
petulantly
then
be
thou
the
first
to
leave
at
thy
request
my
she
then
whispered
gerard
it
was
only
to
make
you
laugh
you
are
distraught
you
are
sad
judge
whether
i
care
for
the
quips
of
these
little
fools
or
the
admiration
of
these
big
fools
dear
signor
gerard
would
i
were
what
they
take
me
for
you
should
not
be
so
gerard
sighed
deeply
and
shook
his
head
but
touched
by
the
earnest
young
tones
caressed
the
jet
black
locks
much
as
one
strokes
the
head
of
an
affectionate
dog
at
this
moment
a
galley
drifting
slowly
down
stream
got
entangled
for
an
instant
in
their
ropes
for
the
river
turning
suddenly
they
had
shot
out
into
the
stream
and
this
galley
came
between
them
and
the
bank
in
it
a
lady
of
great
beauty
was
seated
under
a
canopy
with
gallants
and
dependents
standing
behind
her
gerard
looked
up
at
the
interruption
it
was
the
princess
claelia
he
coloured
and
withdrew
his
hand
from
marcia
head
marcia
was
all
admiration
aha
ladies
said
she
here
is
a
rival
an
ye
will
those
cheeks
were
coloured
by
peace
child
peace
said
gerard
make
not
too
free
with
the
why
she
heard
me
not
oh
ser
gerard
what
a
lovely
creature
two
of
the
females
had
been
for
some
time
past
putting
their
heads
together
and
casting
glances
at
marcia
one
of
them
now
addressed
her
signorina
do
you
love
almonds
the
speaker
had
a
lapful
of
them
yes
i
love
them
when
i
can
get
them
said
marcia
pettishly
and
eyeing
the
fruit
with
desire
but
yours
is
not
the
hand
to
give
me
any
i
you
are
much
mistook
said
the
other
here
catch
and
suddenly
threw
a
double
handful
into
marcia
lap
marcia
brought
her
knees
together
by
an
irresistible
instinct
aha
you
are
caught
my
lad
cried
she
of
the
nuts

a
man
or
a
boy
a
woman
still
parteth
her
knees
to
catch
the
nuts
the
surer
in
her
apron
but
a
man
closeth
his

hose

said
he

too
handsome

ser
gerard
they
have
found
me
out
observed
the
epicaene
calmly
cracking
an
almond
the
libertines
vowed
it
was
impossible
and
all
glared
at
the
goddess
like
a
battery
but
vanucci
struck
in
and
reminded
the
gaping
gazers
of
a
recent
controversy
in
which
they
had
with
a
unanimity
not
often
found
among
dunces
laughed
gerard
and
him
to
scorn
for
saying
that
men
were
as
beautiful
as
women
in
a
true
artist
eye
where
are
ye
now
this
is
my
boy
andrea
and
you
have
all
been
down
on
your
knees
to
him

but
oh
my
little
ladies
when
he
lectured
you
and
flung
your
stibium
your
cerussa
and
your
purpurissum
back
in
your
faces

i
was
like
to
burst

grinds

colours
ha

he
he
he
ho
the
little
impostor
duck
him
what
for
signors
cried
andrea
in
dismay
and
lost
his
rich
carnation
but
the
females
collected
round
him
and
vowed
nobody
should
harm
a
hair
of
his
head
the
dear
child
how
well
his
pretty
little
saucy
ways
become
oh
what
eyes
and
teeth
and
what
eyebrows
and
hair
and
what
lashes
and
what
a
nose
the
sweetest
little
ear
in
the
world
and
what
health
touch
but
his
cheek
with
a
pin
the
blood
should
who
would
be
so
cruel
he
is
a
rosebud
washed
in
and
they
revenged
themselves
for
their
beaux
admiration
of
her
by
lavishing
all
their
tenderness
on
him
but
one
there
was
who
was
still
among
these
butterflies
but
no
longer
of
them
the
sight
of
the
princess
claelia
had
torn
open
his
wound
scarce
three
months
ago
he
had
declined
the
love
of
that
peerless
creature
a
love
illicit
and
insane
but
at
least
refined
how
much
lower
had
he
fallen
now
how
happy
he
must
have
been
when
the
blandishments
of
claelia
that
might
have
melted
an
anchorite
could
not
tempt
him
from
the
path
of
loyalty
now
what
was
he
he
had
blushed
at
her
seeing
him
in
such
company
yet
it
was
his
daily
company
he
hung
over
the
boat
in
moody
silence
and
from
that
hour
another
phase
of
his
misery
began
and
grew
upon
him
some
wretched
fools
try
to
drown
care
in
drink
the
fumes
of
intoxication
vanish
the
inevitable
care
remains
and
must
be
faced
at
last
with
an
aching
head
disordered
stomach
and
spirits
artificially
depressed
gerard
conduct
had
been
of
a
piece
with
these
maniacs
to
survive
his
terrible
blow
he
needed
all
his
forces
his
virtue
his
health
his
habits
of
labour
and
the
calm
sleep
that
is
labour
satellite
above
all
his
piety
yet
all
these
balms
to
wounded
hearts
he
flung
away
and
trusted
to
moral
intoxication
its
brief
fumes
fled
the
bereaved
heart
lay
still
heavy
as
lead
within
his
bosom
but
now
the
dark
vulture
remorse
sat
upon
it
rending
it
broken
health
means
wasted
innocence
fled
margaret
parted
from
him
by
another
gulf
wider
than
the
grave
the
hot
fit
of
despair
passed
away
the
cold
fit
of
despair
came
on
then
this
miserable
young
man
spurned
his
gay
companions
and
all
the
world
he
wandered
alone
he
drank
wine
alone
to
stupefy
himself
and
paralyze
a
moment
the
dark
foes
to
man
that
preyed
upon
his
soul
he
wandered
alone
amidst
the
temples
of
old
rome
and
lay
stony
eyed
woebegone
among
their
ruins
worse
wrecked
than
they
last
of
all
came
the
climax
to
which
solitude
that
gloomy
yet
fascinating
foe
of
minds
diseased
pushes
the
hopeless
he
wandered
alone
at
night
by
dark
streams
and
eyed
them
and
eyed
them
with
decreasing
repugnance
there
glided
peace
perhaps
annihilation
what
else
was
left
him
these
dark
spells
have
been
broken
by
kind
words
by
loving
and
cheerful
voices
the
humblest
friend
the
afflicted
one
possesses
may
speak
or
look
or
smile
a
sunbeam
between
him
and
that
worst
madness
gerard
now
brooded
where
was
teresa
where
his
hearty
kind
old
landlady
they
would
see
with
their
homely
but
swift
intelligence
they
would
see
and
save
no
they
knew
not
where
he
was
or
whither
he
was
gliding
and
is
there
no
mortal
eye
upon
the
poor
wretch
and
the
dark
road
he
is
going
yes
one
eye
there
is
upon
him
watching
his
every
movement
following
him
abroad
tracking
him
home
and
that
eye
is
the
eye
of
an
enemy
an
enemy
to
the
death
chapter
lxiv
in
an
apartment
richly
furnished
the
floor
covered
with
striped
and
spotted
skins
of
animals
a
lady
sat
with
her
arms
extended
before
her
and
her
hands
half
clenched
the
agitation
of
her
face
corresponded
with
this
attitude
she
was
pale
and
red
by
turns
and
her
foot
restless
presently
the
curtain
was
drawn
by
a
domestic
the
lady
brow
flushed
the
maid
said
in
an
whisper
altezza
the
man
is
the
lady
bade
her
admit
him
and
snatched
up
a
little
black
mask
and
put
it
on
and
in
a
moment
her
colour
was
gone
and
the
contrast
between
her
black
mask
and
her
marble
cheeks
was
strange
and
fearful
a
man
entered
bowing
and
scraping
it
was
such
a
figure
as
crowds
seem
made
of
short
hair
roundish
head
plain
but
decent
clothes
features
neither
comely
not
forbidding
nothing
to
remark
in
him
but
a
singularly
restless
eye
after
a
profusion
of
bows
he
stood
opposite
the
lady
and
awaited
her
pleasure
they
have
told
you
for
what
you
are
wanted
yes
did
those
who
spoke
to
you
agree
as
to
what
you
are
to
receive
yes
signora
is
the
full
price
and
purchases
the
greater
vendetta
unless
of
your
benevolence
you
choose
to
content
yourself
with
the
i
understand
you
not
said
the
lady
ah
this
is
the
signora
first
the
lesser
vendetta
lady
is
the
death
of
the
body
only
we
watch
our
man
come
out
of
a
church
or
take
him
in
an
innocent
hour
and
so
deal
with
him
in
the
greater
vendetta
we
watch
him
and
catch
him
hot
from
some
unrepented
sin
and
so
slay
his
soul
as
well
as
his
body
but
this
vendetta
is
not
so
run
upon
now
as
it
was
a
few
years
man
silence
me
his
tongue
and
let
his
treasonable
heart
beat
no
more
but
his
soul
i
have
no
feud
so
be
it
signora
he
who
spoke
to
me
knew
not
the
man
nor
his
name
nor
his
abode
from
whom
shall
i
learn
these
from
at
this
the
man
with
the
first
symptoms
of
anxiety
he
had
shown

her
to
be
cautious
and
particular
in
this
part
of
the
business
fear

not
said
she
listen
it
is
a
young
man
tall
of
stature
and
auburn
hair
and
dark
blue
eyes
and
an
honest
face
would
deceive
a
saint
he
lives
in

the
bravo
showed
her
a
steel
gauntlet
we
strike
with
such
force
we
need

guard
our
hand
this
is
our
he
then
undid
his
doublet
and
gave
her
a
glimpse
of
a
coat
of
mail
beneath
and
finally
laid
his
glittering
stiletto
on
the
table
with
a
flourish
the
lady
shuddered
at
first
but
presently
took
it
up
in
her
white
hand
and
tried
its
point
against
her
finger
beware
madam
said
the
bravo
what
is
it
poisoned
saints
forbid
we
steal
no
lives
we
take
them
with

not
drugs
but
is
newly

and
i
feared
for
the
signora
white
his
skin
is
as
white
as
mine
said
she
with
a
sudden
gleam
of
pity
it
lasted
but
a
moment
but
his
heart
is
black
as
soot
say
do
i
not
well
to
remove
a
traitor
that
slanders
me
the
signora
will
settle
that
with
her
confessor
i
am
but
a
tool
in
noble
hands
like
my
the
princess
appeared
not
to
hear
the
speaker
oh
how
i
could
have
loved
him
to
the
death
as
now
i
hate
him
fool
he
will
learn
to
trifle
with
princes
to
spurn
them
and
fawn
on
them
and
prefer
the
scum
of
the
town
to
them
and
make
them
a
she
looked
up
why
thou
here
haste
thee
revenge
it
is
customary
to
pay
half
the
price
beforehand
ah
i
forgot
thy
revenge
is
bought
here
is
more
than
half
and
she
pushed
a
bag
across
the
table
to
him
when
the
blow
is
struck
come
for
the
you
will
soon
see
me
again
and
he
retired
bowing
and
scraping
the
princess
burning
with
jealousy
mortified
pride
and
dread
of
exposure
for
till
she
knew
gerard
no
public
stain
had
fallen
on
her
sat
where
he
left
her
masked
with
her
arms
straight
out
before
her
and
the
nails
of
her
clenched
hand
nipping
the
table
so
sat
the
fabled
sphynx
so
sits
a
tigress
yet
there
crept
a
chill
upon
her
now
that
the
assassin
was
gone
and
moody
misgivings
heaved
within
her
precursors
of
vain
remorse
gerard
and
margaret
were
before
their
age
this
was
your
true
mediaeval
proud
amorous
vindictive
generous
foolish
cunning
impulsive
unprincipled
and
ignorant
as
dirt
power
is
the
curse
of
such
a
creature
forced
to
do
her
own
crimes
the
weakness
of
her
nerves
would
have
balanced
the
violence
of
her
passions
and
her
bark
been
worse
than
her
bite
but
power
gives
a
feeble
furious
woman
male
instruments
and
the
effect
is
as
terrible
as
the
combination
is
unnatural
in
this
instance
it
whetted
an
assassin
dagger
for
a
poor
forlorn
wretch
just
meditating
suicide
chapter
lxv
it
happened
two
days
after
the
scene
i
have
endeavoured
to
describe
that
gerard
wandering
through
one
of
the
meanest
streets
in
rome
was
overtaken
by
a
thunderstorm
and
entered
a
low
hostelry
he
called
for
wine
and
the
rain
continuing
soon
drank
himself
into
a
half
stupid
condition
and
dozed
with
his
head
on
his
hands
and
his
hands
upon
the
table
in
course
of
time
the
room
began
to
fill
and
the
noise
of
the
rude
guests
to
wake
him
then
it
was
he
became
conscious
of
two
figures
near
him
conversing
in
a
low
voice
one
was
a
pardoner
the
other
by
his
dress
clean
but
modest
might
have
passed
for
a
decent
tradesman
but
the
way
he
had
slouched
his
hat
over
his
brows
so
as
to
hide
all
his
face
except
his
beard
showed
he
was
one
of
those
who
shun
the
eye
of
honest
men
and
of
the
law
the
pair
were
driving
a
bargain
in
the
sin
market
and
by
an
arrangement
not
uncommon
at
that
date
the
crime
to
be
forgiven
was
yet
to
be
committed
under
the
celestial
contract
he
of
the
slouched
hat
was
complaining
of
the
price
pardons
had
reached
if
they
go
up
any
higher
we
poor
fellows
shall
be
shut
out
of
heaven
the
pardoner
denied
the
charge
flatly
indulgences
were
never
cheaper
to
good
the
other
inquired
who
were
they
why
such
as
sin
by
the
market
like
reasonable
creatures
but
if
you
will
be
so
perverse
as
go
and
pick
out
a
crime
the
pope
hath
set
his
face
against
blame
yourself
not
me
then
to
prove
that
crime
of
one
sort
or
another
was
within
the
means
of
all
but
the
very
scum
of
society
he
read
out
the
scale
from
a
written
parchment
it
was
a
curious
list
but
not
one
that
could
be
printed
in
this
book
and
to
mutilate
it
would
be
to
misrepresent
it
it
is
to
be
found
in
any
great
library
suffice
it
to
say
that
murder
of
a
layman
was
much
cheaper
than
many
crimes
my
lay
readers
would
deem
light
by
comparison
this
told
and
by
a
little
trifling
concession
on
each
side
the
bargain
was
closed
the
money
handed
over
and
the
aspirant
to
heaven
favour
forgiven
beforehand
for
removing
one
layman
the
price
for
disposing
of
a
clerk
bore
no
proportion
the
word
assassination
was
never
once
uttered
by
either
merchant
all
this
buzzed
in
gerard
ear
but
he
never
lifted
his
head
from
the
table
only
listened
stupidly
however
when
the
parties
rose
and
separated
he
half
raised
his
head
and
eyed
with
a
scowl
the
retiring
figure
of
the
purchaser
if
margaret
was
alive
muttered
he
i
take
thee
by
the
throat
and
throttle
thee
thou
cowardly
stabber
but
she
is
dead
dead
dead
die
all
the
world
is
nought
to
me
so
that
i
die
among
the
when
he
got
home
there
was
a
man
in
a
slouched
hat
walking
briskly
to
and
fro
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
why
there
is
that
cur
again
thought
gerard
but
in
this
state
of
mind
the
circumstance
made
no
impression
whatever
on
him
chapter
lxvi
two
nights
after
this
pietro
vanucci
and
andrea
sat
waiting
supper
for
gerard
the
former
grew
peevish
it
was
past
nine
at
last
he
sent
andrea
to
gerard
room
on
the
desperate
chance
of
his
having
come
in
unobserved
andrea
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
he
returned
without
gerard
but
with
a
slip
of
paper
andrea
could
not
read
as
scholars
in
his
day
and
charity
boys
in
ours
understand
the
art
but
he
had
a
quick
eye
and
had
learned
how
the
words
pietro
vanucci
looked
on
paper
that
is
for
you
i
trow
said
he
proud
of
his
intelligence
pietro
snatched
it
and
read
it
to
andrea
with
his
satirical
comments
pietro
dear
andrea
life
is
too
great
a
burden
so
is
my
lad
but
that
is
no
reason
for
being
abroad
at
supper
is
not
a
my
habits
said
the
poplar
to
the
juniper
thou
andrea
mine
amethyst
ring
and
me
in
both
your
hearts
a
month
or
two
why
andrea
my
body
ere
this
ye
read
it
will
lie
in
tiber
trouble
not
to
look
for
it
is
not
worth
the
pains
oh
unhappy
day
that
it
was
born
oh
happy
night
that
rids
me
of
it
adieu
gerard
here
is
a
sorry
jest
of
the
peevish
rogue
said
pietro
but
his
pale
cheek
and
chattering
teeth
belied
his
words
andrea
filled
the
house
with
his
cries
o
miserable
day
o
calamity
of
calamities
gerard
my
friend
my
sweet
patron
help
help
he
is
killing
himself
oh
good
people
help
me
save
him
and
after
alarming
all
the
house
he
ran
into
the
street
bareheaded
imploring
all
good
christians
to
help
him
save
his
friend
a
number
of
persons
soon
collected
but
poor
andrea
could
not
animate
their
sluggishness
go
down
to
the
river
no
it
was
not
their
business
what
part
of
the
river
it
was
a
wild
goose
chase
it
was
not
lucky
to
go
down
to
the
river
after
sunset
too
many
ghosts
walked
those
banks
all
night
a
lackey
however
who
had
been
standing
some
time
opposite
the
house
said
he
would
go
with
andrea
and
this
turned
three
or
four
of
the
younger
ones
the
little
band
took
the
way
to
the
river
the
lackey
questioned
andrea
andrea
sobbing
told
him
about
the
letter
and
gerard
moody
ways
of
late
that
lackey
was
a
spy
of
the
princess
claelia
their
italian
tongues
went
fast
till
they
neared
the
tiber
but
the
moment
they
felt
the
air
from
the
river
and
the
smell
of
the
stream
in
the
calm
spring
night
they
were
dead
silent
the
moon
shone
calm
and
clear
in
a
cloudless
sky
their
feet
sounded
loud
and
ominous
their
tongues
were
hushed
presently
hurrying
round
a
corner
they
met
a
man
he
stopped
irresolute
at
sight
of
them
the
man
was
bareheaded
and
his
dripping
hair
glistened
in
the
moonlight
and
at
the
next
step
they
saw
his
clothes
were
drenched
with
water
here
he
is
cried
one
of
the
young
men
unacquainted
with
face
and
figure
the
stranger
turned
instantly
and
fled
they
ran
after
him
might
and
main
andrea
leading
and
the
lackey
next
andrea
gained
on
him
but
in
a
moment
he
twisted
up
a
narrow
alley
andrea
shot
by
unable
to
check
himself
and
the
pursuers
soon
found
themselves
in
a
labyrinth
in
which
it
was
vain
to
pursue
a
quickfooted
fugitive
who
knew
every
inch
of
it
and
could
now
only
be
followed
by
the
ear
they
returned
to
their
companions
and
found
them
standing
on
the
spot
where
the
man
had
stood
and
utterly
confounded
for
pietro
had
assured
them
that
the
fugitive
had
neither
the
features
nor
the
stature
of
gerard
are
ye
verily
sure
said
they
he
had
been
in
the
river
why
in
the
saints
names
fled
he
at
our
approach
then
said
vanucci
friends
methinks
this
has
nought
to
do
with
him
we
seek
what
shall
we
do
andrea
here
the
lackey
put
in
his
word
let
us
track
him
to
the
water
side
to
make
sure
see
he
hath
come
dripping
all
the
this
advice
was
approved
and
with
very
little
difficulty
they
tracked
the
man
course
but
soon
they
encountered
a
new
enigma
they
had
gone
scarcely
fifty
yards
ere
the
drops
turned
away
from
the
river
and
took
them
to
the
gate
of
a
large
gloomy
building
it
was
a
monastery
they
stood
irresolute
before
it
and
gazed
at
the
dark
pile
it
seemed
to
them
to
hide
some
horrible
mystery
but
presently
andrea
gave
a
shout
here
be
the
drops
again
cried
he
and
this
road
leadeth
to
the
they
resumed
the
chase
and
soon
it
became
clear
the
drops
were
now
leading
them
home
the
track
became
wetter
and
wetter
and
took
them
to
the
tiber
edge
and
there
on
the
bank
a
bucketful
appeared
to
have
been
discharged
from
the
stream
at
first
they
shouted
and
thought
they
had
made
a
discovery
but
reflection
showed
them
it
amounted
to
nothing
certainly
a
man
had
been
in
the
water
and
had
got
out
of
it
in
safety
but
that
man
was
not
gerard
one
said
he
knew
a
fisherman
hard
by
that
had
nets
and
drags
they
found
the
fisherman
and
paid
him
liberally
to
sink
nets
in
the
river
below
the
place
and
to
drag
it
above
and
below
and
promised
him
gold
should
he
find
the
body
then
they
ran
vainly
up
and
down
the
river
which
flowed
so
calm
and
voiceless
holding
this
and
a
thousand
more
strange
secrets
suddenly
andrea
with
a
cry
of
hope
ran
back
to
the
house
he
returned
in
less
than
half
an
hour
no
he
groaned
and
wrung
his
hands
what
is
the
hour
asked
the
lackey
four
hours
past
my
pretty
lad
said
the
lackey
solemnly
say
a
mass
for
thy
soul
for
he
is
not
among
living
the
morning
broke
worn
out
with
fatigue
andrea
and
pietro
went
home
heart
sick
the
days
rolled
on
mute
as
the
tiber
as
to
gerard
fate
chapter
lxvii
it
would
indeed
have
been
strange
if
with
such
barren
data
as
they
possessed
those
men
could
have
read
the
handwriting
on
the
bank
for
there
on
that
spot
an
event
had
just
occurred
which
take
it
altogether
was
perhaps
without
a
parallel
in
the
history
of
mankind
and
may
remain
so
to
the
end
of
time
but
it
shall
be
told
in
a
very
few
words
partly
by
me
partly
by
an
actor
in
the
scene
gerard
then
after
writing
his
brief
adieu
to
pietro
and
andrea
had
stolen
down
to
the
river
at
nightfall
he
had
taken
his
measures
with
a
dogged
resolution
not
uncommon
in
those
who
are
bent
on
he
filled
his
pockets
with
all
the
silver
and
copper
he
possessed
that
he
might
sink
the
surer
and
so
provided
hurried
to
a
part
of
the
stream
that
he
had
seen
was
little
frequented
there
are
some
especially
women
who
look
about
to
make
sure
there
is
somebody
at
hand
but
this
resolute
wretch
looked
about
him
to
make
sure
there
was
nobody
and
to
his
annoyance
he
observed
a
single
figure
leaning
against
the
corner
of
an
alley
so
he
affected
to
stroll
carelessly
away
but
returned
to
the
spot
lo
the
same
figure
emerged
from
a
side
street
and
loitered
about
can
he
be
watching
me
can
he
know
what
i
am
here
for
thought
gerard
he
went
briskly
off
walked
along
a
street
or
two
made
a
detour
and
came
back
the
man
had
vanished
but
lo
on
gerard
looking
all
round
to
make
sure
there
he
was
a
few
yards
behind
apparently
fastening
his
shoe
gerard
saw
he
was
watched
and
at
this
moment
observed
in
the
moonlight
a
steel
gauntlet
in
his
sentinel
hand
then
he
knew
it
was
an
assassin
strange
to
say
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
his
was
the
life
aimed
at
to
be
sure
he
was
not
aware
he
had
an
enemy
in
the
world
he
turned
and
walked
up
to
the
bravo
my
good
friend
said
he
eagerly
sell
me
thine
arm
a
single
stroke
see
here
is
all
i
have
and
he
forced
his
money
into
the
bravo
hands
oh
prithee
prithee
do
one
good
deed
and
rid
me
of
my
hateful
life
and
even
while
speaking
he
undid
his
doublet
and
bared
his
bosom
the
man
stared
in
his
face
why
do
ye
hesitate
shrieked
gerard
have
ye
no
bowels
is
it
so
much
pains
to
lift
your
arm
and
fall
it
is
it
because
i
am
poor
and
give
ye
gold
useless
wretch
canst
only
strike
a
man
behind
not
look
one
in
the
face
there
then
do
but
turn
thy
head
and
hold
thy
tongue
and
with
a
snarl
of
contempt
he
ran
from
him
and
flung
himself
into
the
water
margaret
at
the
heavy
plunge
of
his
body
in
the
stream
the
bravo
seemed
to
recover
from
a
stupor
he
ran
to
the
bank
and
with
a
strange
cry
the
assassin
plunged
in
after
the
what
followed

be
related
by
the
assassin
chapter
lxviii
a
woman
has
her
own
troubles
as
a
man
has
his
and
we
male
writers
seldom
do
more
than
indicate
the
griefs
of
the
other
sex
the
intelligence
of
the
female
reader
must
come
to
our
aid
and
fill
up
our
cold
outlines
so
have
i
indicated
rather
than
described
what
margaret
brandt
went
through
up
to
that
eventful
day
when
she
entered
house
an
enemy
read
her
sweetheart
letter
and
remained
a
friend
and
now
a
woman
greatest
trial
drew
near
and
gerard
far
away
she
availed
herself
but
little
of
eli
sudden
favour
for
this
reserve
she
had
always
a
plausible
reason
ready
and
never
hinted
at
the
true
one
which
was
this
there
were
two
men
in
that
house
at
sight
of
whom
she
shuddered
with
instinctive
antipathy
and
dread
she
had
read
wickedness
and
hatred
in
their
faces
and
mysterious
signals
of
secret
intelligence
she
preferred
to
receive
catherine
and
her
daughter
at
home
the
former
went
to
see
her
every
day
and
was
wrapped
up
in
the
expected
event
catherine
was
one
of
those
females
whose
office
is
to
multiply
and
rear
the
multiplied
who
when
at
last
they
consent
to
leave
off
pelting
one
out
of
every
room
in
the
house
with
babies
hover
about
the
fair
scourges
that
are
still
in
full
swing
and
do
so
cluck
they
seem
to
multiply
by
proxy
it
was
in
this
spirit
she
entreated
eli
to
let
her
stay
at
rotterdam
while
he
went
back
to
tergou
the
poor
lass
hath
not
a
soul
about
her
that
knows
anything
about
anything
what
avail
a
pair
o
soldiers
why
that
sort
o
cattle
should
be
putten
out
o
doors
the
first
at
such
an
a
need
i
say
that
this
was
a
great
comfort
to
margaret
poor
soul
she
was
full
of
anxiety
as
the
time
drew
near
she
should
die
and
gerard
away
but
things
balance
themselves
her
poverty
and
her
helplessness
which
had
cost
her
such
a
struggle
stood
her
in
good
stead
now
adversity
iron
hand
had
forced
her
to
battle
the
lassitude
that
overpowers
the
rich
of
her
sex
and
to
be
for
ever
on
her
feet
working
she
kept
this
up
to
the
last
by
catherine
advice
and
so
it
was
that
one
fine
evening
just
at
sunset
she
lay
weak
as
water
but
safe
with
a
little
face
by
her
side
and
the
heaven
of
maternity
opening
on
her
why
dost
weep
sweetheart
all
of
a
sudden
he
is
not
here
to
see
ah
well
lass
he
will
be
here
ere
is
weaned
meantime
god
hath
been
as
good
to
thee
as
to
a
woman
born
and
do
but
bethink
thee
it
might
have
been
a
girl
did
my
very
own
kate
threaten
me
with
one
and
here
we
have
got
the
bonniest
boy
in
holland
and
a
rare
heavy
one
the
saints
be
praised
ay
mother
i
am
but
a
sorry
ungrateful
wretch
to
weep
if
only
gerard
were
here
to
see
it
is
strange
i
bore
him
well
enow
to
be
away
from
me
in
my
sorrow
but
oh
it
does
seem
so
hard
he
should
not
share
my
joy
prithee
prithee
come
to
me
gerard
dear
dear
gerard
and
she
stretched
out
her
feeble
arms
catherine
hustled
about
but
avoided
margaret
eyes
for
she
could
not
restrain
her
own
tears
at
hearing
her
own
absent
child
thus
earnestly
addressed
presently
turning
round
she
found
margaret
looking
at
her
with
a
singular
expression
heard
you
nought
no
my
lamb
what
i
did
cry
on
gerard
but
ay
ay
sure
i
heard
well
he
answered
tush
girl
say
not
mother
as
sure
as
i
lie
here
with
his
boy
by
my
side
his
voice
came
back
to
me
so
yet
methought
was
not
his
happy
voice
but
that
might
be
the
distance
all
voices
go
off
sad
like
at
a
distance
why
art
not
happy
sweetheart
and
i
so
happy
this
night
mother
i
seem
never
to
have
felt
a
pain
or
known
a
and
her
sweet
eyes
turned
and
gloated
on
the
little
face
in
silence
that
very
night
gerard
flung
himself
into
the
tiber
and
that
very
hour
she
heard
him
speak
her
name
he
cried
aloud
in
death
jaws
and
despair
margaret
account
for
it
those
who
can
i
can
not
chapter
lxix
in
the
guest
chamber
of
a
dominican
convent
lay
a
single
stranger
exhausted
by
successive
and
violent
fits
of
nausea
which
had
at
last
subsided
leaving
him
almost
as
weak
as
margaret
lay
that
night
in
holland
a
huge
wood
fire
burned
on
the
hearth
and
beside
it
hung
the
clothes
a
gigantic
friar
sat
by
his
bedside
reading
pious
collects
aloud
from
his
breviary
the
patient
at
times
eyed
him
and
seemed
to
listen
at
others
closed
his
eyes
and
moaned
the
monk
kneeled
down
with
his
face
touching
the
ground
and
prayed
for
him
then
rose
and
bade
him
farewell
day
breaks
said
he
i
must
prepare
for
good
father
jerome
before
you
go
how
came
i
hither
by
the
hand
of
heaven
you
flung
away
god
gift
he
bestowed
it
on
you
again
think
on
it
hast
tried
the
world
and
found
its
gall
now
try
the
church
the
church
is
peace
pax
he
was
gone
gerard
lay
back
meditating
and
wondering
till
weak
and
wearied
he
fell
into
a
doze
when
he
awoke
again
he
found
a
new
nurse
seated
beside
him
it
was
a
layman
with
an
eye
as
small
and
restless
as
friar
jerome
was
calm
and
majestic
the
man
inquired
earnestly
how
he
felt
very
very
weak
where
have
i
seen
you
before
messer
none
the
worse
for
my
gauntlet
inquired
the
other
with
considerable
anxiety
i
was
fain
to
strike
you
withal
or
both
you
and
i
should
be
at
the
bottom
of
gerard
stared
at
him
what
was
you
saved
me
how
well
signor
i
was
by
the
banks
of
tiber
an
errand
no
matter
what
you
came
to
me
and
begged
hard
for
a
dagger
stroke
but
ere
i
could
oblige
you
ay
even
as
you
spoke
to
me
i
knew
you
for
the
signor
that
saved
my
wife
and
child
upon
the
it
is
teresa
husband
and
an
assassin
at
your
service
well
ser
gerard
the
next
thing
was
you
flung
yourself
into
tiber
and
bade
me
hold
i
remember
had
it
been
any
but
you
believe
me
i
had
obeyed
you
and
not
wagged
a
finger
men
are
my
foes
they
may
all
hang
on
one
rope
or
drown
in
one
river
for
me
but
when
thou
sinking
in
tiber
didst
cry
ah
my
heart
it
cried
how
could
i
go
home
and
look
her
in
the
face
did
i
let
thee
die
and
by
the
very
death
thou
savedst
her
from
so
in
i
went
and
luckily
for
us
both
i
swim
like
a
duck
you
seeing
me
near
and
being
bent
on
destruction
tried
to
grip
me
and
so
end
us
both
but
i
swam
round
thee
and
receive
my
excuses
so
buffeted
thee
on
the
nape
of
the
neck
with
my
steel
glove
that
thou
lost
sense
and
i
with
much
ado
the
stream
being
strong
did
draw
thy
body
to
land
but
insensible
and
full
of
water
then
i
took
thee
on
my
back
and
made
for
my
own
home
will
nurse
him
and
be
pleased
with
me
thought
i
but
hard
by
this
monastery
a
holy
friar
the
biggest
i
saw
met
us
and
asked
the
matter
so
i
told
him
he
looked
hard
at
thee
know
the
face
quoth
he
one
gerard
a
fair
youth
from
holland
same
quo
i
then
said
his
reverence
hath
friends
among
our
brethren
leave
him
with
us
charity
it
is
our
office
also
he
told
me
they
of
the
convent
had
better
means
to
tend
thee
than
i
had
and
that
was
true
enow
so
i
just
bargained
to
be
let
in
to
see
thee
once
a
day
and
here
thou
and
the
miscreant
cast
a
strange
look
of
affection
and
interest
upon
gerard
gerard
did
not
respond
to
it
he
felt
as
if
a
snake
were
in
the
room
he
closed
his
eyes
ah
thou
wouldst
sleep
said
the
miscreant
eagerly
i
and
he
retired
on
with
a
promise
to
come
every
day
gerard
lay
with
his
eyes
closed
not
asleep
but
deeply
pondering
saved
from
death
by
an
assassin
was
not
this
the
finger
of
heaven
of
that
heaven
he
had
insulted
cursed
and
defied
he
shuddered
at
his
blasphemies
he
tried
to
pray
he
found
he
could
utter
prayers
but
he
could
not
pray
i
am
doomed
eternally
he
cried
doomed
the
organ
of
the
convent
church
burst
on
his
ear
in
rich
and
solemn
harmony
then
rose
the
voices
of
the
choir
chanting
a
full
service
among
them
was
one
that
seemed
to
hover
above
the
others
and
tower
towards
heaven
a
sweet
boy
voice
full
pure
angelic
he
closed
his
eyes
and
listened
the
days
of
his
own
boyhood
flowed
back
upon
him
in
those
sweet
pious
harmonies
no
earthly
dross
there
no
foul
fierce
passions
rending
and
corrupting
the
soul
peace
peace
sweet
balmy
peace
ay
he
sighed
the
church
is
peace
of
mind
till
i
left
her
bosom
i
knew
sorrow
nor
and
the
poor
torn
worn
creature
wept
and
even
as
he
wept
there
beamed
on
him
the
sweet
and
reverend
face
of
one
he
had
never
thought
to
see
again
it
was
the
face
of
father
anselm
the
good
father
had
only
reached
the
convent
the
night
before
last
gerard
recognized
him
in
a
moment
and
cried
to
him
oh
father
anselm
you
cured
my
wounded
body
in
juliers
now
cure
my
hurt
soul
in
rome
alas
you
can
not
anselm
sat
down
by
the
bedside
and
putting
a
gentle
hand
on
his
head
first
calmed
him
with
a
soothing
word
or
two
he
then
for
he
had
learned
how
gerard
came
there
spoke
to
him
kindly
but
solemnly
and
made
him
feel
his
crime
and
urged
him
to
repentance
and
gratitude
to
that
divine
power
which
had
thwarted
his
will
to
save
his
soul
come
my
son
said
he
first
purge
thy
bosom
of
its
ah
father
said
gerard
in
juliers
i
could
then
i
was
innocent
but
now
impious
monster
that
i
am
i
dare
not
confess
to
why
not
my
son
thinkest
thou
i
have
not
sinned
against
heaven
in
my
time
and
deeply
oh
how
deeply
come
poor
laden
soul
pour
forth
thy
grief
pour
forth
thy
faults
hold
back
nought
lie
not
oppressed
and
crushed
by
hidden
and
soon
gerard
was
at
father
anselm
knees
confessing
his
every
sin
with
sighs
and
groans
of
penitence
thy
sins
are
great
said
anselm
thy
temptation
also
was
great
terribly
great
i
must
consult
our
good
the
good
anselm
kissed
his
brow
and
left
him
to
consult
the
superior
as
to
his
penance
and
lo
gerard
could
pray
now
and
he
prayed
with
all
his
heart
the
phase
through
which
this
remarkable
mind
now
passed
may
be
summed
in
a
word
penitence
he
turned
with
terror
and
aversion
from
the
world
and
begged
passionately
to
remain
in
the
convent
to
him
convent
nurtured
it
was
like
a
bird
returning
wounded
wearied
to
its
gentle
nest
he
passed
his
novitiate
in
prayer
and
mortification
and
pious
reading
and
meditation
the
princess
claelia
spy
went
home
and
told
her
that
gerard
was
certainly
dead
the
manner
of
his
death
unknown
at
present
she
seemed
literally
stunned
when
after
a
long
time
she
found
breath
to
speak
at
all
it
was
to
bemoan
her
lot
cursed
with
such
ready
tools
so
soon
she
sighed
see
how
swift
these
monsters
are
to
do
ill
deeds
they
come
to
us
in
our
hot
blood
and
first
tempt
us
with
their
venal
daggers
then
enact
the
mortal
deeds
we
had
thought
on
but
for
ere
many
hours
had
passed
her
pity
for
gerard
and
hatred
of
his
murderer
had
risen
to
fever
heat
which
with
this
fool
was
blood
heat
poor
soul
i
can
not
call
thee
back
to
life
but
he
shall
never
live
that
traitorously
slew
and
she
put
armed
men
in
ambush
and
kept
them
on
guard
all
day
ready
when
lodovico
should
come
for
his
money
to
fall
on
him
in
a
certain
antechamber
and
hack
him
to
pieces
strike
at
his
head
said
she
for
he
weareth
a
privy
coat
of
mail
and
if
he
goes
hence
alive
your
own
heads
shall
answer
and
so
she
sat
weeping
her
victim
and
pulling
the
strings
of
machines
to
shed
the
blood
of
a
second
for
having
been
her
machine
to
kill
the
first
chapter
lxx
one
of
the
novice
gerard
penances
was
to
receive
lodovico
kindly
feeling
secretly
as
to
a
slimy
serpent
never
was
better
bestowed
and
like
most
rational
penances
it
soon
became
no
penance
at
all
at
first
the
pride
and
complacency
with
which
the
assassin
gazed
on
the
one
life
he
had
saved
was
perhaps
as
ludicrous
as
pathetic
but
it
is
a
great
thing
to
open
a
good
door
in
a
heart
one
good
thing
follows
another
through
the
aperture
finding
it
so
sweet
to
save
life
the
miscreant
went
on
to
be
averse
to
taking
it
and
from
that
to
remorse
and
from
remorse
to
something
very
like
penitence
and
here
teresa
cooperated
by
threatening
not
for
the
first
time
to
leave
him
unless
he
would
consent
to
lead
an
honest
life
the
good
fathers
of
the
convent
lent
their
aid
and
lodovico
and
teresa
were
sent
by
sea
to
leghorn
where
teresa
had
friends
and
the
assassin
settled
down
and
became
a
porter
he
found
it
miserably
dull
work
at
first
and
said
so
but
methinks
this
dull
life
of
plodding
labour
was
better
for
him
than
the
brief
excitement
of
being
hewn
in
pieces
by
the
princess
myrmidons
his
exile
saved
the
unconscious
penitent
from
that
fate
and
the
princess
balked
of
her
revenge
took
to
brooding
and
fell
into
a
profound
melancholy
dismissed
her
confessor
and
took
a
new
one
with
a
great
reputation
for
piety
to
whom
she
confided
what
she
called
her
griefs
the
new
confessor
was
no
other
than
fra
jerome
she
could
not
have
fallen
into
better
hands
he
heard
her
grimly
out
then
took
her
and
shook
the
delusions
out
of
her
as
roughly
as
if
she
had
been
a
for
to
do
this
hard
monk
justice
on
the
path
of
duty
he
feared
the
anger
of
princes
as
little
as
he
did
the
sea
he
showed
her
in
a
few
words
all
thunder
and
lightning
that
she
was
the
criminal
of
criminals
thou
art
the
devil
that
with
thy
money
hath
tempted
one
man
to
slay
his
fellow
and
then
blinded
with
instead
of
blaming
and
punishing
thyself
art
thirsting
for
more
blood
of
guilty
men
but
not
so
guilty
as
at
first
she
resisted
and
told
him
she
was
not
used
to
be
taken
to
task
by
her
confessors
but
he
overpowered
her
and
so
threatened
her
with
the
church
curse
here
and
hereafter
and
so
tore
the
scales
off
her
eyes
and
thundered
at
her
and
crushed
her
that
she
sank
down
and
grovelled
with
remorse
and
terror
at
the
feet
of
the
gigantic
boanerges
oh
holy
father
have
pity
on
a
poor
weak
woman
and
help
me
save
my
guilty
soul
i
was
benighted
for
want
of
ghostly
counsel
like
thine
good
father
i
waken
as
from
a
dream
doff
thy
jewels
said
fra
jerome
sternly
i
will
i
doff
thy
silk
and
velvet
and
in
humbler
garb
than
wears
thy
meanest
servant
wend
thou
instant
to

will
said
the
princess
faintly
no
shoes
but
a
bare
sandal
no
wash
the
feet
of
pilgrims
both
going
and
coming
and
to
such
of
them
as
be
holy
friars
tell
thy
sin
and
abide
their
oh
holy
father
let
me
wear
my
humph
oh
mercy
bethink
thee
my
features
are
known
through
ay
beauty
is
a
curse
to
most
of
ye
well
thou
mayst
mask
thine
eyes
no
on
this
concession
she
seized
his
hand
and
was
about
to
kiss
it
but
he
snatched
it
rudely
from
her
what
would
ye
do
that
hand
handled
the
eucharist
but
an
hour
agone
is
it
fit
for
such
as
thou
to
touch
it
ah
no
but
oh
go
not
without
giving
your
penitent
daughter
your
time
enow
to
ask
it
when
you
come
back
from
thus
that
marvellous
occurrence
by
tiber
banks
left
its
mark
on
all
the
actors
as
prodigies
are
said
to
do
the
assassin
softened
by
saving
the
life
he
was
paid
to
take
turned
from
the
stiletto
to
the
porter
knot
the
princess
went
barefoot
to
loretto
weeping
her
crime
and
washing
the
feet
of
men
and
gerard
carried
from
the
tiber
into
that
convent
a
suicide
now
passed
for
a
young
saint
within
its
walls
loving
but
experienced
eyes
were
on
him
upon
a
shorter
probation
than
usual
he
was
admitted
to
priest
orders
and
soon
after
took
the
monastic
vows
and
became
a
friar
of
dominic
dying
to
the
world
the
monk
parted
with
the
very
name
by
which
he
had
lived
in
it
and
so
broke
the
last
link
of
association
with
earthly
feelings
here
gerard
ended
and
brother
clement
began
chapter
lxxi
as
is
the
race
of
leaves
so
is
that
of
and
a
great
man
budded
unnoticed
in
a
tailor
house
at
rotterdam
this
year
and
a
large
man
dropped
to
earth
with
great
eclat
philip
duke
of

earl
of

lay
sick
at
bruges
now
paupers
got
sick
and
got
well
as
nature
pleased
but
woe
betided
the
rich
in
an
age
when
for
one
malady
killed
three
fell
by
dr
remedy
the
duke
complaint
nameless
then
is
now
diphtheria
it
is
and
was
a
very
weakening
malady
and
the
duke
was
old
so
altogether
dr
remedy
bled
him
the
duke
turned
very
cold
wonderful
then
dr
remedy
had
recourse
to
the
arcana
of
science
ho
this
is
grave
flay
me
an
ape
incontinent
and
clap
him
to
the
duke
breast
officers
of
state
ran
septemvious
seeking
an
ape
to
counteract
the
bloodthirsty
tomfoolery
of
the
human
species
perdition
the
duke
was
out
of
apes
there
were
buffaloes
lizards
turks
leopards
any
unreasonable
beast
but
the
right
one
why
there
used
to
be
an
ape
about
said
one
if
i
stand
here
i
saw
so
there
used
but
the
mastiff
had
mangled
the
sprightly
creature
for
stealing
his
supper
and
so
fulfilled
the
human
precept
soyez
de
votre
siecle
in
this
emergency
the
seneschal
cast
his
despairing
eyes
around
and
not
in
vain
a
hopeful
light
shot
into
them
here
is
this
said
he
sotto
voce
surely
this
will
serve
is
altogether
apelike
doublet
and
hose
nay
said
the
chancellor
peevishly
the
princess
marie
would
hang
us
she
doteth
on
now
this
was
our
friend
giles
strutting
all
unconscious
in
cloth
of
gold
then
dr
remedy
grew
impatient
and
bade
flay
a
dog
a
dog
is
next
best
to
an
ape
only
it
must
be
a
dog
all
of
one
so
they
flayed
a
dog
and
clapped
it
yet
palpitating
to
their
sovereign
breast
and
he
died
philip
the
good
thus
scientifically
disposed
of
left
children
of
whom
one
somehow
or
another
was
legitimate
and
reigned

descended
from

kings
of

through
thierry
of

and

lxxii
the
cloister
the
dominicans
or
preaching
friars
once
the
most
powerful
order
in
europe
were
now
on
the
wane
their
rivals
and
bitter
enemies
the
franciscans
were
overpowering
them
throughout
europe
even
in
england
a
rich
and
religious
country
where
under
the
name
of
the
black
friars
they
had
once
been
paramount
therefore
the
sagacious
men
who
watched
and
directed
the
interests
of
the
order
were
never
so
anxious
to
incorporate
able
and
zealous
sons
and
send
them
forth
to
win
back
the
world
the
zeal
and
accomplishments
of
clement
especially
his
rare
mastery
of
language
for
he
spoke
latin
italian
french
high
and
low
dutch
soon
transpired
and
he
was
destined
to
travel
and
preach
in
england
corresponding
with
the
roman
centre
but
jerome
who
had
the
superior
ear
obstructed
this
design
clement
said
he
has
the
milk
of
the
world
still
in
his
veins
its
feelings
its
weaknesses
let
not
his
zeal
and
his
humility
tempt
us
to
forego
our
ancient
wisdom
try
him
first
and
temper
him
lest
one
day
we
find
ourselves
leaning
on
a
reed
for
a
staff
it
is
well
advised
said
the
prior
take
him
in
hand
then
jerome
following
the
ancient
wisdom
took
clement
and
tried
him
one
day
he
brought
him
to
a
field
where
the
young
men
amused
themselves
at
the
games
of
the
day
he
knew
this
to
be
a
haunt
of
clement
late
friends
and
sure
enough
ere
long
pietro
vanucci
and
andrea
passed
by
them
and
cast
a
careless
glance
on
the
two
friars
they
did
not
recognize
their
dead
friend
in
a
shaven
monk
clement
gave
a
very
little
start
and
then
lowered
his
eyes
and
said
a
paternoster
would
ye
not
speak
with
them
brother
said
jerome
trying
him
no
brother
yet
was
it
good
for
me
to
see
them
they
remind
me
of
the
sins
i
can
never
repent
it
is
well
said
jerome
and
he
made
a
cold
report
in
favour
then
jerome
took
clement
to
many
and
then
into
noisome
dungeons
places
where
the
darkness
was
appalling
and
the
stench
loathsome
pestilential
and
men
looking
like
wild
beasts
lay
coiled
in
rags
and
filth
and
despair
it
tried
his
body
hard
but
the
soul
collected
all
its
powers
to
comfort
such
poor
wretches
there
as
were
not
past
comfort
and
clement
shone
in
that
trial
jerome
reported
that
clement
spirit
was
willing
but
his
flesh
was
weak
good
said
anselm
his
flesh
is
weak
but
his
spirit
is
but
there
was
a
greater
trial
in
store
i
will
describe
it
as
it
was
seen
by
others
one
morning
a
principal
street
in
rome
was
crowded
and
even
the
avenues
blocked
up
with
heads
it
was
an
execution
no
common
crime
had
been
done
and
on
no
vulgar
victim
the
governor
of
rome
had
been
found
in
his
bed
at
daybreak
slaughtered
his
hand
raised
probably
in
lay
by
his
side
severed
at
the
wrist
his
throat
was
cut
and
his
temples
bruised
with
some
blunt
instrument
the
murder
had
been
traced
to
his
servant
and
was
to
be
expiated
in
kind
this
very
morning
italian
executions
were
not
cruel
in
general
but
this
murder
was
thought
to
call
for
exact
and
bloody
retribution
the
criminal
was
brought
to
the
house
of
the
murdered
man
and
fastened
for
half
an
hour
to
its
wall
after
this
foretaste
of
legal
vengeance
his
left
hand
was
struck
off
like
his
victim
a
fowl
was
cut
open
and
fastened
round
the
bleeding
stump
with
what
view
i
really
do
know
but
by
the
look
of
it
some
mare
nest
of
the
poor
dear
doctors
and
the
murderer
thus
mutilated
and
bandaged
was
hurried
to
the
scaffold
and
there
a
young
friar
was
most
earnest
and
affectionate
in
praying
with
him
and
for
him
and
holding
the
crucifix
close
to
his
eyes
presently
the
executioner
pulled
the
friar
roughly
on
one
side
and
in
a
moment
felled
the
culprit
with
a
heavy
mallet
and
falling
on
him
cut
his
throat
from
ear
to
ear
there
was
a
cry
of
horror
from
the
crowd
the
young
friar
swooned
away
a
gigantic
monk
strode
forward
and
carried
him
off
like
a
child
brother
clement
went
back
to
the
convent
sadly
discouraged
he
confessed
to
the
prior
with
tears
of
regret
courage
son
clement
said
the
prior
a
dominican
is
not
made
in
a
day
thou
shalt
have
another
trial
and
i
forbid
thee
to
go
to
it
clement
bowed
his
head
in
token
of
obedience
he
had
not
long
to
wait
a
robber
was
brought
to
the
scaffold
a
monster
of
villainy
and
cruelty
who
had
killed
men
in
pure
wantonness
after
robbing
them
clement
passed
his
last
night
in
prison
with
him
accompanied
him
to
the
scaffold
and
then
prayed
with
him
and
for
him
so
earnestly
that
the
hardened
ruffian
shed
tears
and
embraced
him
clement
embraced
him
too
though
his
flesh
quivered
with
repugnance
and
held
the
crucifix
earnestly
before
his
eyes
the
man
was
garotted
and
clement
lost
sight
of
the
crowd
and
prayed
loud
and
earnestly
while
that
dark
spirit
was
passing
from
earth
he
was
no
sooner
dead
than
the
hangman
raised
his
hatchet
and
quartered
the
body
on
the
spot
and
oh
mysterious
heart
of
man
the
people
who
had
seen
the
living
body
robbed
of
life
with
indifference
almost
with
satisfaction
uttered
a
piteous
cry
at
each
stroke
of
the
axe
upon
his
corpse
that
could
feel
nought
clement
too
shuddered
then
but
stood
firm
like
one
of
those
rocks
that
vibrate
but
can
not
be
thrown
down
but
suddenly
jerome
voice
sounded
in
his
ear
brother
clement
get
thee
on
that
cart
and
preach
to
the
people
nay
quickly
strike
with
all
thy
force
on
all
this
iron
while
yet
is
hot
and
souls
are
to
be
clement
colour
came
and
went
and
he
breathed
hard
but
he
obeyed
and
with
step
mounted
the
cart
and
preached
his
first
sermon
to
the
first
crowd
he
had
ever
faced
oh
that
sea
of
heads
his
throat
seemed
parched
his
heart
thumped
his
voice
trembled
the
greatness
of
the
occasion
the
sight
of
the
eager
upturned
faces
and
his
own
heart
full
of
zeal
fired
the
pale
monk
he
told
them
this
robber
history
warm
from
his
own
lips
in
the
prison
and
showed
his
hearers
by
that
example
the
gradations
of
folly
and
crime
and
warned
them
solemnly
not
to
put
foot
on
the
first
round
of
that
fatal
ladder
and
as
alternately
he
thundered
against
the
shedders
of
blood
and
moved
the
crowd
to
charity
and
pity
his
tremors
left
him
and
he
felt
all
strung
up
like
a
lute
and
gifted
with
an
unsuspected
force
he
was
master
of
that
listening
crowd
could
feel
their
very
pulse
could
play
sacred
melodies
on
them
as
on
his
psaltery
sobs
and
groans
attested
his
power
over
the
mob
already
excited
by
the
tragedy
before
them
jerome
stared
like
one
who
goes
to
light
a
stick
and
fires
a
rocket
after
a
while
clement
caught
his
look
of
astonishment
and
seeing
no
approbation
in
it
broke
suddenly
off
and
joined
him
it
was
my
first
endeavour
said
he
apologetically
your
behest
came
on
me
like
a
thunderbolt
was
i
did
i
oh
correct
me
and
aid
me
with
your
experience
brother
humph
said
jerome
doubtfully
he
added
rather
sullenly
after
long
reflection
give
the
glory
to
god
brother
clement
my
opinion
is
thou
art
an
orator
he
reported
the
same
at
headquarters
half
reluctantly
for
he
was
an
honest
friar
though
a
disagreeable
one
one
julio
antonelli
was
accused
of
sacrilege
three
witnesses
swore
they
saw
him
come
out
of
the
church
whence
the
were
stolen
and
at
the
very
time
other
witnesses
proved
an
alibi
for
him
as
positively
neither
testimony
could
be
shaken
in
this
doubt
antonelli
was
permitted
the
trial
by
water
hot
or
cold
by
the
hot
trial
he
must
put
his
bare
arm
into
boiling
water
fourteen
inches
deep
and
take
out
a
pebble
by
the
cold
trial
his
body
must
be
let
down
into
eight
feet
of
water
the
clergy
who
thought
him
innocent
recommended
the
hot
water
trial
which
to
those
whom
they
favoured
was
not
so
terrible
as
it
sounded
but
the
poor
wretch
had
not
the
nerve
and
chose
the
cold
ordeal
and
this
gave
jerome
another
opportunity
of
steeling
clement
antonelli
took
the
sacrament
and
then
was
stripped
naked
on
the
banks
of
the
tiber
and
tied
hand
and
foot
to
prevent
those
struggles
by
which
a
man
throwing
his
arms
out
of
the
water
sinks
his
body
he
was
then
let
down
gently
into
the
stream
and
floated
a
moment
with
just
his
hair
above
water
a
simultaneous
roar
from
the
crowd
on
each
bank
proclaimed
him
guilty
but
the
next
moment
the
ropes
which
happened
to
be
new
got
wet
and
he
settled
down
another
roar
proclaimed
his
innocence
they
left
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
the
appointed
time
rather
more
than
half
a
minute
then
drew
him
up
gurgling
and
gasping
and
screaming
for
mercy
and
after
the
appointed
prayers
dismissed
him
cleared
of
the
charge
during
the
experiment
clement
prayed
earnestly
on
the
bank
when
it
was
over
he
thanked
god
in
a
loud
but
slightly
quavering
voice
he
asked
jerome
whether
the
man
ought
not
to
be
compensated
for
what
for
the
pain
the
dread
the
suffocation
poor
soul
he
liveth
but
hath
tasted
all
the
bitterness
of
death
yet
he
had
done
no
he
is
rewarded
enough
in
that
he
is
cleared
of
his
but
being
innocent
of
that
fault
yet
hath
he
drunk
death
cup
though
not
to
the
dregs
and
his
accusers
less
innocent
than
he
do
suffer
jerome
replied
somewhat
sternly
it
is
not
in
this
world
men
are
really
punished
brother
clement
unhappy
they
who
sin
yet
suffer
not
and
happy
they
who
suffer
such
ills
as
earth
hath
power
to
inflict
is
counted
to
them
above
ay
and
a
clement
bowed
his
head
submissively
may
thy
good
words
not
fall
to
the
ground
but
take
root
in
my
heart
brother
but
the
severest
trial
clement
underwent
at
jerome
hands
was
unpremeditated
it
came
about
thus
jerome
in
an
indulgent
moment
went
with
him
to
fra
colonna
and
there
the
dream
of
polifilo
lay
on
the
table
just
copied
fairly
the
poor
author
in
the
pride
of
his
heart
pointed
out
a
in
it
for
ages
said
he
fools
have
been
lavishing
poetic
praise
and
amorous
compliment
on
mortal
women
mere
creatures
of
earth
smacking
palpably
of
their
origin
sirens
at
the
windows
where
our
roman
women
in
particular
have
by
lifelong
study
learned
the
wily
art
to
show
their
one
good
feature
though
but
an
ear
or
an
eyelash
at
a
jalosy
and
hide
all
the
rest
magpies
at
the
door
capre
n
i
giardini

in
strada
sante
in
chiesa
diavoli
in

then
come
i
and
ransack
the
minstrels
lines
for
amorous
turns
not
forgetting
those
which
petrarch
wasted
on
that
french
jilt
laura
the
sliest
of
them
all
and
i
lay
you
the
whole
bundle
of
spice
at
the
feet
of
the
only
females
worthy
amorous
incense
to
wit
the
nine
by
which
goodly
stratagem
said
jerome
who
had
been
turning
the
pages
all
this
time
you
a
friar
of
dominic
have
produced
an
obscene
and
he
dashed
polifilo
on
the
table
obscene
thou
discourteous
monk
and
the
author
ran
round
the
table
snatched
polifilo
away
locked
him
up
and
trembling
with
mortification
said
my
gerard
pshaw
brother
had
not
found
polifilo
obscene
puris
omnia
such
as
read
your
polifilo
heaven
grant
they
may
be
few
will
find
him
what
i
find
poor
colonna
gulped
down
this
bitter
pill
as
he
might
and
had
he
not
been
in
his
own
lodgings
and
a
gentleman
as
well
as
a
scholar
there
might
have
been
a
vulgar
quarrel
as
it
was
he
made
a
great
effort
and
turned
the
conversation
to
a
beautiful
chrysolite
the
cardinal
colonna
had
lent
him
and
while
clement
handled
it
enlarged
on
its
moral
virtues
for
he
went
the
whole
length
of
his
age
as
a
worshipper
of
jewels
but
jerome
did
not
and
expostulated
with
him
for
believing
that
one
dead
stone
could
confer
valour
on
its
wearer
another
chastity
another
safety
from
poison
another
temperance
the
experience
of
ages
proves
they
do
said
colonna
as
to
the
last
virtue
you
have
named
there
sits
a
living
proof
this
gerard
i
beg
pardon
brother
thingemy
comes
from
the
north
where
men
drink
like
fishes
yet
was
he
ever
most
abstemious
and
why
carried
an
amethyst
the
clearest
and
fullest
coloured
i
saw
on
any
but
noble
finger
where
in
heaven
name
is
thine
amethyst
show
it
this
unbeliever
and
was
that
amethyst
made
the
boy
temperate
asked
jerome
ironically
certainly
why
what
is
the
derivation
and
meaning
of
amethyst
a
negative
and
methua
to
tipple
go
to
names
are
but
the
signs
of
things
a
stone
is
not
called
amethustos
for
two
thousand
years
out
of
mere
sport
and
abuse
of
he
then
went
through
the
prime
jewels
illustrating
their
moral
properties
especially
of
the
ruby
the
sapphire
the
emerald
and
the
opal
by
anecdotes
out
of
grave
historians
these
be
old
wives
fables
said
jerome
contemptuously
was
ever
such
credulity
as
thine
now
credulity
is
a
reproach
sceptics
have
often
the
to
incur
but
it
mortifies
them
none
the
less
for
that
the
believer
in
stones
writhed
under
it
and
dropped
the
subject
then
jerome
mistaking
his
silence
exhorted
him
to
go
a
step
farther
and
give
up
from
this
day
his
vain
pagan
lore
and
study
the
lives
of
the
saints
blot
out
these
heathen
superstitions
from
thy
mind
brother
as
christianity
hath
blotted
them
from
the
and
in
this
strain
he
proceeded
repeating
incautiously
some
current
but
loose
theological
statements
then
the
smarting
polifilo
revenged
himself
he
flew
out
and
hurled
a
mountain
of
crude
miscellaneous
lore
upon
jerome
of
which
partly
for
want
of
time
partly
for
lack
of
learning
i
can
reproduce
but
a
few
fragments
the
heathen
blotted
out
why
they
hold
of
the
world
and
what
have
we
christians
invented
without
their
aid
painting
sculpture
these
are
heathen
arts
and
we
but
pigmies
at
them
what
modern
mind
can
conceive
and
grave
so
forms
as
did
the
chief
athenian
sculptors
and
the
libyan
licas
and
dinocrates
of
macedon
and
scopas
timotheus
leochares
and
briaxis
chares
lysippus
and
the
immortal
three
of
rhodes
that
wrought
laocoon
from
a
single
block
what
prince
hath
the
genius
to
turn
mountains
into
statues
as
was
done
at
bagistan
and
projected
at
athos
what
town
the
soul
to
plant
a
colossus
of
brass
in
the
sea
for
the
tallest
ships
to
sail
in
and
out
between
his
legs
is
it
architecture
we
have
invented
why
here
too
we
are
but
children
can
we
match
for
pure
design
the
parthenon
with
its
clusters
of
double
and
single
doric
columns
i
do
adore
the
doric
when
the
scale
is
large
and
for
grandeur
and
finish
the
theatres
of
greece
and
rome
or
the
prodigious
temples
of
egypt
up
to
whose
portals
men
walked
through
avenues
a
mile
long
of
sphinxes
each
as
big
as
a
venetian
palace
and
all
these
prodigies
of
porphyry
cut
and
polished
like
crystal
not
rough
hewn
as
in
our
puny
structures
even
now
their
polished
columns
and
pilasters
lie
and
broken
with
acanthus
and
myrtle
but
sparkling
still
and
flouting
the
slovenly
art
of
modern
workmen
is
it
sewers
aqueducts
viaducts
why
we
have
lost
the
art
of
making
a
road
lost
it
with
the
greatest
models
under
our
very
eye
is
it
sepulchres
of
the
dead
why
no
christian
nation
has
ever
erected
a
tomb
the
sight
of
which
does
not
set
a
scholar
laughing
do
but
think
of
the
mausoleum
and
the
pyramids
and
the
monstrous
sepulchres
of
the
indus
and
ganges
which
outside
are
mountains
and
within
are
mines
of
precious
stones
ah
you
have
not
seen
the
east
jerome
or
you
could
not
decry
the
jerome
observed
that
these
were
mere
material
things
true
greatness
was
in
the
soul
well
then
replied
colonna
in
the
world
of
mind
what
have
we
discovered
is
it
geometry
is
it
logic
nay
we
are
all
pupils
of
euclid
and
aristotle
is
it
written
characters
an
invention
almost
divine
we
no
more
invented
it
than
cadmus
did
is
it
poetry
homer
hath
never
been
approached
by
us
nor
hath
virgil
nor
horace
is
it
tragedy
or
comedy
why
poets
actors
theatres
all
fell
to
dust
at
our
touch
have
we
succeeded
in
reviving
them
would
you
compare
our
little
miserable
mysteries
and
moralities
all
frigid
personification
and
dog
latin
with
the
glories
of
a
greek
play
on
the
decoration
of
which
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
had
been
spent
performed
inside
a
marble
miracle
the
audience
a
seated
city
and
the
poet
a
sophocles
what
then
have
we
invented
is
it
monotheism
why
the
learned
and
philosophical
among
the
greeks
and
romans
held
it
even
their
more
enlightened
poets
were
monotheists
in
their
sleeves
zeus
estin
ouranos
zeus
te
gy
zeus
toi
panta
saith
the
greek
and
lucan
echoes
him
est
quod
cunque
vides
quo
cunque
moveris
their
vulgar
were
polytheists
and
what
are
ours
we
have
not
invented
of
the
saints
our
sancti
answers
to
their
daemones
and
divi
and
the
heathen
used
to
pray
their
divi
or
deified
mortal
to
intercede
with
the
higher
divinity
but
the
ruder
minds
among
them
incapable
of
nice
distinctions
worshipped
those
lesser
gods
they
should
have
but
invoked
and
so
do
the
mob
of
christians
in
our
day
following
the
heathen
vulgar
or
by
unbroken
tradition
for
in
holy
writ
is
no
polytheism
of
any
sort
or
kind
we
have
not
invented
so
much
as
a
form
or
variety
of
polytheism
the
pagan
vulgar
worshipped
all
sorts
of
deified
mortals
and
each
had
his
favourite
to
whom
he
prayed
ten
times
for
once
to
the
omnipotent
our
vulgar
worship
canonized
mortals
and
each
has
his
favourite
to
whom
he
prays
ten
times
for
once
to
god
call
you
that
invention
invention
is
confined
to
the
east
among
the
ancient
vulgar
only
the
mariners
were
monotheists
they
worshipped
venus
called
her
maris
and
caelorum
among
our
vulgar
only
the
mariners
are
monotheists
they
worship
the
virgin
mary
and
call
her
the
of
the
sea
and
the
of
heaven
call
you
theirs
a
new
religion
an
old
doubtlet
with
a
new
button
our
vulgar
make
images
and
adore
them
which
is
absurd
for
adoration
is
the
homage
due
from
a
creature
to
its
creator
now
here
man
is
the
creator
so
the
statues
ought
to
worship
him
and
would
if
they
had
brains
enough
to
justify
a
rat
in
worshipping
them
but
even
this
abuse
though
childish
enough
to
be
modern
is
ancient
the
pagan
vulgar
in
these
parts
made
their
images
then
knelt
before
them
adorned
them
with
flowers
offered
incense
to
them
lighted
tapers
before
them
carried
them
in
procession
and
made
pilgrimages
to
them
just
to
the
smallest
tittle
as
we
their
imitators
jerome
here
broke
in
impatiently
and
reminded
him
that
the
images
the
most
revered
in
christendom
were
made
by
no
mortal
hand
but
had
dropped
from
heaven
ay
cried
colonna
such
are
the
tutelary
images
of
most
great
italian
towns
i
have
examined
nineteen
of
them
and
made
drafts
of
them
if
they
came
from
the
sky
our
worst
sculptors
are
our
angels
but
my
mind
is
easy
on
that
score
ungainly
statue
or
villainous
daub
fell
never
yet
from
heaven
to
smuggle
the
bread
out
of
capable
workmen
mouths
all
this
is
pagan
and
arose
thus
the
trojans
had
oriental
imaginations
and
feigned
that
their
palladium
a
wooden
statue
three
cubits
long
fell
down
from
heaven
the
greeks
took
this
fib
home
among
the
spoils
of
troy
and
soon
it
rained
statues
on
all
the
grecian
cities
and
their
latin
apes
and
one
of
these
palladia
gave
paul
trouble
at
ephesus
a
statue
of
diana
that
fell
down
from
jupiter
credat
qui
credere
what
would
you
cast
your
profane
doubts
on
that
picture
of
our
blessed
lady
which
scarce
a
century
agone
hung
lustrous
in
the
air
over
this
very
city
and
was
taken
down
by
the
pope
and
bestowed
in
church
i
have
no
profane
doubts
on
the
matter
jerome
this
is
the
story
of
numa
shield
revived
by
theologians
with
an
itch
for
fiction
but
no
talent
that
way
not
being
orientals
the
or
sacred
shield
of
numa
hung
lustrous
in
the
air
over
this
very
city
till
that
pious
prince
took
it
down
and
hung
it
in
the
temple
of
jupiter
be
just
swallow
both
stories
or
neither
the
della
verita
passes
for
a
statue
of
the
virgin
and
convicted
a
woman
of
perjury
the
other
day
it
is
in
reality
an
image
of
the
goddess
rhea
and
the
modern
figment
is
one
of
its
ancient
traditions
swallow
both
or
neither
bavium
non

but
indeed
we
owe
all
our
palladiuncula
and
all
our
speaking
nodding
winking
sweating
bleeding
statues
to
these
poor
abused
heathens
the
athenian
statues
all
sweated
before
the
battle
of

so
did
the
roman
statues
during

you
may
see
near

a

nearly
in

we
of
the

had
his

kissed
under
the

the
druids
kissed
the
high

toe
a
thousand
years
the
mussulmans
who
like
you
profess
to
abhor
heathenism
kiss
the
stone
of
the
caaba
a
pagan
practice
the
priests
of
baal
kissed
their
idols
so
tully
tells
us
of
a
fair
image
of
hercules
at
agrigentum
whose
chin
was
worn
by
kissing
the
lower
parts
of
the
statue
we
call
peter
are
jupiter
the
toe
is
sore
worn
but
not
all
by
christian
mouths
the
heathen
vulgar
laid
their
lips
there
first
for
many
a
year
and
ours
have
but
followed
them
as
monkeys
their
masters
and
that
is
why
down
with
the
poor
heathen

on

coffin
and
saying
dust
to

our
incense
is
oriental
roman
pagan
and
the
early
fathers
of
the
church
regarded
it
with
superstitious
horror
and
died
for
refusing
to
handle
it
our
holy
water
is
pagan
and
all
its
uses
see
here
is
a
pagan
aspersorium
could
you
tell
it
from
one
of
ours
it
stood
in
the
same
part
of
their
temples
and
was
used
in
ordinary
worship
as
ours
and
in
extraordinary
purifications
they
called
it
aqua
lustralis
their
vulgar
like
ours
thought
drops
of
it
falling
on
the
body
would
wash
out
sin
and
their
men
of
sense
like
ours
smiled
or
sighed
at
such
credulity
what
saith
ovid
of
this
folly
which
hath
outlived

no

we
not
fra

uttered
all
this
with
such
volubility
that
his
hearers
could
not
edge
in
a
word
of
remonstrance
and
not
being
interrupted
in
praising
his
favourites
he
recovered
his
good
humour
without
any
diminution
of
his
volubility
we
celebrate
the
miraculous
conception
of
the
virgin
on
the
of
february
the
old
romans
celebrated
the
miraculous
conception
of
juno
on
the
of
february
our
feast
of
all
saints
is
on
the
november
the
festum
dei
mortis
was
on
the
november
our
candlemas
is
also
an
old
roman
feast
neither
the
date
nor
the
ceremony
altered
one
tittle
the
patrician
ladies
carried
candles
about
the
city
that
night
as
our
signoras
do
now
at
the
gate
of
san
croce
our
courtesans
keep
a
feast
on
the
august
ask
them
why
the
little
noodles
can
not
tell
you
on
that
very
spot
stood
the
temple
of
venus
her
building
is
gone
but
her
rite
remains
did
we
discover
purgatory
on
the
contrary
all
we
really
know
about
it
is
from
two
treatises
of
plato
the
gorgias
and
the
phaedo
and
the
sixth
book
of
virgil
aeneid
i
take
it
from
a
holier
source
gregory
said
jerome
sternly
like
enough
replied
colonna
drily
but
gregory
was
not
so
nice
he
took
it
from
virgil
some
souls
saith
gregory
are
purged
by
fire
others
by
water
others
by
air
says
virgil
panduntur
inanes
suspensae
ad
ventous
aliis
sub
gurgite
vasto
infectum
eluitur
scelus
aut
exuritur
igni
but
peradventure
you
think
pope
gregory
i
lived
before
virgil
and
virgil
versified
him
but
the
doctrine
is
eastern
and
as
much
older
than
plato
as
plato
than
gregory
our
prayers
for
the
dead
came
from
asia
with
aeneas
ovid
tells
that
when
he
prayed
for
the
soul
of
anchises
the
custom
was
strange
in
italy
morem

pietatis

tuas
the
sortes
which
i
have
seen
consulted
on
the
altar
are
a
parody
on
the
virgilianae
our
numerous
altars
in
one
church
are
heathen
the
jews
who
are
monotheists
have
but
one
altar
in
a
church
but
the
pagans
had
many
being
polytheists
in
the
temple
of
pathian
venus
were
a
hundred
of
them
que

our
altar
and
our
hundred
lights
around

are

we
invent
nothing
not
even

our
very
devil

the
god
pan
horns
and
hoofs
and
all
but
blackened
for
we
can
not
draw
we
can
but
daub
the
figures
of
antiquity
with
a
little
sorry
paint
or
soot
our
moses
hath
stolen
the

of
ammon
our
wolfgang
the
hook
of
saturn
and
janus
bore
the

of

before

all
our
really
old
italian
bronzes
of
the
virgin
and
child
are
venuses
and
cupids
so
is
the
wooden
statue
that
stands
hard
by
this
house
of
pope
joan
and
the
child
she
is
said
to
have
brought
forth
there
in
the
middle
of
a
procession
idiots
are
children
thirteen
years
old
and
that

is
not
a

younger

cupid
and
since
you
accuse
me
of
credulity
know
that
to
my
mind
that
papess
is
full
as
mythological
born
of
froth
and
every
way
unreal
as
the
goddess
who
passes
for
her
in
the
next
street
or
as
the
saints
you
call
baccho
and
quirina
or
oracte
which
is
a
corruption
of
mount
soracte
or
amphibolus
an
english
saint
which
is
a
corruption
of
the
cloak
worn
by
their
alban
or
as
the
spanish
saint
viar
which
words
on
his
tombstone
written
thus
viar
prove
him
no
saint
but
a
good
old
nameless
heathen
and
viarum
or
overseer
of
roads
would
he
were
back
to
earth
and
paganizing
of
our
christian
roads
or
as
our
veronica
of
benasco
which
veronica
is
a
corruption
of
the
icon
which
this
saint
brought
into
the
church
i
wish
it
may
not
be
as
unreal
as
the
donor
or
as
the
eleven
thousand
virgins
of
cologne
who
were
but
a
clement
interrupted
him
to
inquire
what
he
meant
i
have
spoken
with
those
have
seen
their
what
of
eleven
thousand
virgins
all
collected
in
one
place
and
at
one
time
do
but
bethink
thee
clement
not
one
of
the
great
eastern
cities
of
antiquity
could
collect
eleven
thousand
pagan
virgins
at
one
time
far
less
a
puny
western
city
eleven
thousand
christian
virgins
in
a
little
wee
paynim
city
cunque
ostendis
mihi
sic
incredulus
odi
the
simple
sooth
is
this
the
martyrs
were
two
the
breton
princess
herself
falsely
called
british
and
her
maid
onesimilla
which
is
a
greek
name
onesima
diminished
this
some
fool
did
undecim
mille
eleven
thousand
loose
tongue
found
credulous
ears
and
so
one
fool
made
many
eleven
thousand
of
them
an
you
will
and
you
charge
me
with
credulity
jerome
and
bid
me
read
the
lives
of
the
saints
well
i
have
read
them
and
many
a
dear
old
pagan
acquaintance
i
found
there
the
best
fictions
in
the
book
are
oriental
and
are
known
to
have
been
current
in
persia
and
arabia
eight
hundred
years
and
more
before
the
dates
the
church
assigns
to
them
as
facts
as
for
the
true
western
figments
they
lack
the
oriental
plausibility
think
you
i
am
credulous
enough
to
believe
that
ida
joined
a
decapitated
head
to
its
body
that
cuthbert
carcass
directed
his
bearers
where
to
go
and
where
to
stop
that
a
city
was
eaten
up
of
rats
to
punish
one
hatto
for
comparing
the
poor
to
mice
that
angels
have
a
little
horn
in
their
foreheads
and
that
this
was
seen
and
recorded
at
the
time
by
veronica
of
benasco
who
never
existed
and
hath
left
us
this
information
and
a
miraculous
handkercher
for
my
part
i
think
the
holiest
woman
the
world
ere
saw
must
have
an
existence
ere
she
can
have
a
handkercher
or
an
eye
to
take
unicorns
for
angels
think
you
i
believe
that
a
brace
of
lions
turned
sextons
and
helped
anthony
bury
paul
of
thebes
that
patrick
a
scotch
saint
stuck
a
goat
beard
on
all
the
descendants
of
one
that
offended
him
that
certain
thieves
having
stolen
the
convent
ram
and
denying
it
pol
de
leon
bade
the
ram
bear
witness
and
straight
the
mutton
bleated
in
the
thief
belly
would
you
have
me
give
up
the
skilful
figments
of
antiquity
for
such
old
wives
fables
as
these
the
ancients
lied
about
animals
too
but
then
they
lied
logically
we
unreasonably
do
but
compare
ephis
and
his
lion
or
better
still
androcles
and
his
lion
with
anthony
and
his
two
lions
both
the
pagan
lions
do
what
lions
never
did
but
at
the
least
they
act
in
character
a
lion
with
a
bone
in
his
throat
or
a
thorn
in
his
foot
could
not
do
better
than
be
civil
to
a
man
but
lions
are
asses
in
a
lion
skin
what
leonine
motive
could
they
have
in
turning
sextons
a
lion
business
is
to
make
corpses
not
inter
he
added
with
a
sigh
our
lies
are
as
inferior
to
the
lies
of
the
ancients
as
our
statues
and
for
the
same
reason
we
do
not
study
nature
as
they
did
we
are
imitatores
servum
pecus
believe
you
lives
of
the
saints
that
paul
the
theban
was
the
first
hermit
and
anthony
the
first
caenobite
why
pythagoras
was
an
eremite
and
under
ground
for
seven
years
and
his
daughter
was
an
abbess
monks
and
hermits
were
in
the
east
long
before
moses
and
neither
old
greece
nor
rome
was
ever
without
them
as
for
francis
and
his
snowballs
he
did
but
mimic
diogenes
who
naked
embraced
statues
on
which
snow
had
fallen
the
folly
without
the
poetry
ape
of
an
ape
for
diogenes
was
but
a
mimic
therein
of
the
brahmins
and
indian
gymnosophists
natheless
the
children
of
this
francis
bid
fair
to
pelt
us
out
of
the
church
with
their
snowballs
tell
me
now
clement
what
habit
is
lovelier
than
the
vestments
of
our
priests
well
we
owe
them
all
to
numa
pompilius
except
the
girdle
and
the
stole
which
are
judaical
as
for
the
amice
and
the
albe
they
retain
the
very
names
they
bore
in
numa
day
the
worn
by
the
canons
comes
from
primeval
paganism
is
a
relic
of
those
rude
times
when
the
sacrificing
priest
wore
the
skins
of
the
beasts
with
the
fur
outward
strip
off
thy
black
gown
jerome
thy
girdle
and
cowl
for
they
come
to
us
all
three
from
the
pagan
ladies
let
thy
hair
grow
like
absolom
jerome
for
the
tonsure
is
as
pagan
as
the
take
care
what
thou
sayest
said
jerome
sternly
we
know
the
very
year
in
which
the
church
did
first
ordain
but
not
invent
it
jerome
the
brahmins
wore
it
a
few
thousands
years
ere
that
from
them
it
came
through
the
assyrians
to
the
priests
of
isis
in
egypt
and
afterwards
of
serapis
at
athens
the
late
pope
the
saints
be
good
to
him
once
told
me
the
tonsure
was
forbidden
by
god
to
the
levites
in
the
pentateuch
if
so
this
was
because
of
the
egyptian
priests
wearing
it
i
trust
to
his
holiness
i
am
no
biblical
scholar
the
latin
of
thy
namesake
jerome
is
a
barrier
i
can
not
overleap
ad
me
dominus
dens
dixi
ad

no
thank
you
holy
jerome
i
can
stand
a
good
deal
but
i
can
not
stand
thy
latin
nay
give
me
the
new
testament
is
not
the
greek
of
xenophon
but
is
greek
and
there
be
heathen
sayings
in
it
too
for
paul
was
not
so
spiteful
against
them
as
thou
when
the
heathen
said
a
good
thing
that
suited
his
matter
by
jupiter
he
just
took
it
and
mixed
it
to
all
eternity
with
the
inspired
come
forth
clement
come
forth
said
jerome
rising
and
thou
profane
monk
know
that
but
for
the
powerful
house
that
upholds
thee
thy
accursed
heresy
should
go
no
farther
for
i
would
have
thee
burned
at
the
and
he
strode
out
white
with
indignation
colonna
reception
of
this
threat
did
credit
to
him
as
an
enthusiast
he
ran
and
hallooed
joyfully
after
jerome
and
that
is
pagan
burning
of
men
bodies
for
the
opinions
of
their
souls
is
a
purely
pagan
custom
as
pagan
as
incense
holy
water
a
hundred
altars
in
one
church
the
tonsure
the
cardinal
or
flamen
hat
the
word
pope
the
here
jerome
slammed
the
door
but
ere
they
could
get
clear
of
the
house
a
jalosy
was
flung
open
and
the
paynim
monk
came
out
head
and
shoulders
and
overhung
the
street
shouting
affecti
suppliciis
chrisitiani
genus
hominum
novas
superstitionis
ac
maleficae
and
having
delivered
this
parting
blow
he
felt
a
great
triumphant
joy
and
strode
exultant
to
and
fro
and
not
attending
with
his
usual
care
to
the
fair
way
for
his
room
could
only
be
threaded
by
little
paths
wriggling
among
the
antiquities
tripped
over
the
beak
of
an
egyptian
stork
and
rolled
upon
a
regiment
of
armenian
gods
which
he
found
tough
in
argument
though
small
in
stature
you
will
go
no
more
to
that
heretical
monk
said
jerome
to
clement
clement
sighed
shall
we
leave
him
and
not
try
to
correct
him
make
allowance
for
heat
of
discourse
he
was
nettled
his
words
are
worse
than
his
acts
oh
is
a
pure
and
charitable
so
are
all
satan
does
not
tempt
them
like
other
men
rather
he
makes
them
more
moral
to
give
their
teaching
weight
fra

can
not
be
corrected
his
family
is
in
rome
pray
we
the
saints
he
blasphemes
to
enlighten
him
not
be
the
first
time
they
have
returned
good
for
evil
meantime
thou
art
forbidden
to
consort
with
him
from
this

go
alone
through

and
absolve

exorcise

comfort
the

the

wherever

gathered
and

serves
and
hold
no
converse
with
the
fra

clement
bowed
his
head
then
the
prior
at
jerome
request
had
the
young
friar
watched
and
one
day
the
spy
returned
with
the
news
that
brother
clement
had
passed
by
the
fra
colonna
lodging
and
had
stopped
a
little
while
in
the
street
and
then
gone
on
but
with
his
hand
to
his
eyes
and
slowly
this
report
jerome
took
to
the
prior
the
prior
asked
his
opinion
and
also
anselm
who
was
then
taking
leave
of
him
on
his
return
to
juliers
jerome
humph
he
obeyed
but
with
regret
ay
with
childish
anselm
he
shed
a
natural
tear
at
turning
his
back
on
a
friend
and
a
benefactor
but
he
now
anselm
was
one
of
your
gentle
irresistibles
he
had
at
times
a
mild
ascendant
even
over
jerome
worthy
brother
anselm
said
jerome
clement
is
weak
to
the
very
bone
he
will
disappoint
thee
he
will
do
nothing
great
either
for
the
church
or
for
our
holy
order
yet
he
is
an
orator
and
hath
drunken
of
the
spirit
of
dominic
fly
him
then
with
a
that
same
day
it
was
announced
to
clement
that
he
was
to
go
to
england
immediately
with
brother
jerome
clement
folded
his
hands
on
his
breast
and
bowed
his
head
in
calm
submission
chapter
lxxiii
the
hearth
a
catherine
is
not
an
unmixed
good
in
a
strange
house
the
governing
power
is
strong
in
her
she
has
scarce
crossed
the
threshold
ere
the
utensils
seem
to
brighten
the
hearth
to
sweep
itself
the
windows
to
let
in
more
light
and
the
soul
of
an
enormous
cricket
to
animate
the
but
this
cricket
is
a
busy
body
and
that
is
a
tremendous
character
it
has
no
discrimination
it
sets
everything
to
rights
and
everybody
now
many
things
are
the
better
for
being
set
to
rights
but
everything
is
not
everything
is
the
one
thing
that
stand
being
set
to
rights
except
in
that
calm
and
cool
retreat
the
grave
catherine
altered
the
position
of
every
chair
and
table
in
house
and
perhaps
for
the
better
but
she
must
go
farther
and
upset
the
live
furniture
when
margaret
time
was
close
at
hand
catherine
treacherously
invited
the
aid
of
denys
and
martin
and
on
the
poor
fellows
asking
her
earnestly
what
service
they
could
be
she
told
them
they
might
make
themselves
comparatively
useful
by
going
for
a
little
walk
so
far
so
good
but
she
intimated
further
that
should
the
promenade
extend
into
the
middle
of
next
week
all
the
better
this
was
not
ingratiating
the
subsequent
conduct
of
the
strong
under
the
yoke
of
the
weak
might
have
propitiated
a
with
three
cubs
one
sickly
they
generally
slipped
out
of
the
house
at
daybreak
and
stole
in
like
thieves
at
night
and
if
by
any
chance
they
were
at
home
they
went
about
like
cats
on
a
wall
tipped
with
broken
glass
and
wearing
visages
and
a
general
air
of
subjugation
and
depression
but
all
would
not
do
their
very
presence
was
and
jarred
upon
catherine
nerves
did
instinct
whisper
a
pair
of
depopulators
had
no
business
in
a
house
with
multipliers
twain
the
breastplate
is
no
armour
against
a
female
tongue
and
catherine
ran
infinite
pins
and
needles
of
speech
into
them
in
a
word
when
margaret
came
down
stairs
she
found
the
kitchen
swept
of
heroes
martin
old
and
stiff
had
retreated
no
farther
than
the
street
and
with
the
honours
of
war
for
he
had
carried
off
his
baggage
a
stool
and
sat
on
it
in
the
air
margaret
saw
he
was
out
in
the
sun
but
was
not
aware
he
was
a
fixture
in
that
luminary
she
asked
for
denys
good
kind
denys
he
will
be
right
pleased
to
see
me
about
catherine
wiping
a
bowl
with
now
superfluous
vigour
told
her
denys
was
gone
to
his
friends
in
burgundy
and
high
time
has
been
anigh
them
this
three
years
by
all
what
gone
without
bidding
me
farewell
said
margaret
uplifting
two
tender
eyes
like
violets
catherine
reddened
for
this
new
view
of
the
matter
set
her
conscience
pricking
her
but
she
gave
a
little
toss
and
said
oh
you
were
asleep
at
the
time
and
i
would
not
have
you
poor
denys
said
margaret
and
the
dew
gathered
visibly
on
the
open
violets
catherine
saw
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
and
without
taking
a
bit
of
open
notice
slipped
off
and
lavished
hospitality
and
tenderness
on
the
surviving
depopulator
it
was
sudden
and
martin
old
and
stiff
in
more
ways
than
one
no
thank
you
dame
i
have
got
used
to
out
o
doors
and
i
love
not
changing
and
changing
i
meddle
wi
nobody
here
and
nobody
meddles
oh
you
nasty
cross
old
wretch
screamed
catherine
passing
in
a
moment
from
treacle
to
sharpest
vinegar
and
she
flounced
back
into
the
house
on
calm
reflection
she
had
a
little
cry
then
she
half
reconciled
herself
to
her
conduct
by
vowing
to
be
so
kind
margaret
should
never
miss
her
plagues
of
soldiers
but
feeling
still
a
little
uneasy
she
dispersed
all
regrets
by
a
process
at
once
simple
and
sovereign
she
took
and
washed
the
child
from
head
to
foot
she
washed
him
in
tepid
water
and
heroes
and
their
wrongs
became
as
dust
in
an
ocean
of
soap
and
water
while
this
celestial
ceremony
proceeded
margaret
could
not
keep
quiet
she
hovered
round
the
fortunate
performer
she
must
have
an
apparent
hand
in
it
if
not
a
real
she
put
her
finger
into
the
water
to
pave
the
way
for
her
boy
i
suppose
for
she
could
not
have
deceived
herself
so
far
as
to
think
catherine
would
allow
her
to
settle
the
temperature
during
the
ablution
she
kneeled
down
opposite
the
little
gerard
and
prattled
to
him
with
amazing
fluency
taking
care
however
not
to
articulate
like
people
for
how
could
a
cherub
understand
their
ridiculous
pronunciation
i
wish
you
could
wash
out
that
said
she
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
little
boy
hand
what
what
have
you
not
noticed
on
his
little
granny
looked
and
there
was
a
little
brown
mole
eh
but
this
is
wonderful
she
cried
nature
my
lass
strong
and
meddlesome
to
boot
hast
noticed
such
a
mark
on
some
one
else
tell
the
truth
girl
what
on
him
nay
mother
not
well
then
he
has
and
on
the
very
spot
and
you
never
noticed
that
much
but
dear
heart
i
forgot
you
ha
known
him
from
child
to
man
as
i
have
i
have
had
him
hundreds
o
times
on
my
knees
the
same
as
this
and
washed
him
from
top
to
toe
in
and
she
swelled
with
conscious
superiority
and
margaret
looked
meekly
up
to
her
as
a
woman
beyond
competition
catherine
looked
down
from
her
dizzy
height
and
moralized
she
differed
from
other
in
this
that
she
now
and
then
reflected
not
deeply
or
of
course
i
should
take
care
not
to
print
it
it
is
strange
said
she
how
things
come
round
and
about
life
is
but
a
whirligig
leastways
we
poor
women
our
lives
are
all
cut
upon
one
pattern
was
i
for
washing
out
my
gerard
mole
in
his
young
days
fie
here
a
foul
blot
quo
i
and
scrubbed
away
at
it
i
did
till
i
made
the
poor
wight
cry
so
then
i
thought
was
time
to
give
over
and
now
says
you
to
me
says
you
try
and
wash
you
out
o
my
gerard
finger
says
you
think
o
wash
it
out
cried
margaret
i
would
for
all
the
world
why
it
is
the
sweetest
bit
in
his
little
darling
body
i
kiss
it
morn
and
night
till
he
that
owned
it
first
comes
back
to
us
three
oh
bless
you
my
jewel
of
gold
and
silver
for
being
marked
like
your
own
daddy
to
comfort
and
she
kissed
little
gerard
little
mole
but
she
could
not
stop
there
she
presently
had
him
sprawling
on
her
lap
and
kissed
his
back
all
over
again
and
again
and
seemed
to
worry
him
as
wolf
a
lamb
catherine
looking
on
and
smiling
she
had
seen
a
good
many
of
these
savage
onslaughts
in
her
day
and
this
little
sketch
indicates
the
tenor
of
margaret
life
for
several
months
one
or
two
small
things
occurred
to
her
during
that
time
which
must
be
told
but
i
reserve
them
since
one
string
will
serve
for
many
glass
beads
but
while
her
boy
father
was
passing
through
those
fearful
tempests
of
the
soul
ending
in
the
dead
monastic
calm
her
life
might
fairly
be
summed
in
one
great
blissful
word
maternity
you
who
know
what
lies
in
that
word
enlarge
my
little
sketch
and
see
the
young
mother
nursing
and
washing
and
dressing
and
undressing
and
crowing
and
gambolling
with
her
then
swifter
than
lightning
dart
your
eye
into
italy
and
see
the
cold
cloister
and
the
monks
passing
like
ghosts
eyes
down
hands
meekly
crossed
over
bosoms
dead
to
earthly
feelings
one
of
these
cowled
ghosts
is
he
whose
return
full
of
love
and
youth
and
joy
that
radiant
young
mother
awaits
in
the
valley
of
grindelwald
the
traveller
has
on
one
side
the
perpendicular
alps
all
rock
ice
and
everlasting
snow
towering
above
the
clouds
and
piercing
to
the
sky
on
his
other
hand
little
slopes
but
green
as
emeralds
and
studded
with
cows
and
pretty
cots
and
life
whereas
those
lofty
neighbours
stand
leafless
lifeless
inhuman
sublime
elsewhere
sweet
commonplaces
of
nature
are
apt
to
pass
unnoticed
but
fronting
the
grim
alps
they
soothe
and
even
gently
strike
the
mind
by
contrast
with
their
tremendous
opposites
such
in
their
way
are
the
two
halves
of
this
story
rightly
looked
at
on
the
italian
side
rugged
adventure
strong
passion
blasphemy
vice
penitence
pure
ice
holy
snow
soaring
direct
at
heaven
on
the
dutch
side
all
on
a
humble
scale
and
womanish
but
ever
green
and
as
a
pathway
parts
the
ice
towers
of
grindelwald
aspiring
to
the
sky
from
its
little
sunny
braes
so
here
is
but
a
page
between
the
cloister
and
the
chapter
lxxiv
the
cloister
the
new
pope
favoured
the
dominican
order
the
convent
received
a
message
from
the
vatican
requiring
a
capable
friar
to
teach
at
the
university
of
basle
now
clement
was
the
very
monk
for
this
well
versed
in
languages
and
in
his
worldly
days
had
attended
the
lectures
of
guarini
the
younger
his
visit
to
england
was
therefore
postponed
though
not
resigned
and
meantime
he
was
sent
to
basle
but
not
being
wanted
there
for
three
months
he
was
to
preach
on
the
road
he
passed
out
of
the
northern
gate
with
his
eyes
lowered
and
the
whole
man
wrapped
in
pious
contemplation
oh
if
we
could
paint
a
mind
and
its
story
what
a
walking
fresco
was
this
barefooted
friar
hopeful
happy
love
bereavement
despair
impiety
vice
suicide
remorse
religious
despondency
penitence
death
to
the
world
resignation
and
all
in
twelve
short
months
and
now
the
traveller
was
on
foot
again
but
all
was
changed
no
perilous
adventures
now
the
very
thieves
and
robbers
bowed
to
the
ground
before
him
and
instead
of
robbing
him
forced
stolen
money
on
him
and
begged
his
prayers
this
journey
therefore
furnished
few
picturesque
incidents
i
have
however
some
readers
to
think
of
who
care
little
for
melodrama
and
expect
a
quiet
peep
at
what
passes
inside
a
man
to
such
students
things
undramatic
are
often
vocal
denoting
the
progress
of
a
mind
the
first
sunday
of
clement
journey
was
marked
by
this
he
prayed
for
the
soul
of
margaret
he
had
never
done
so
before
not
that
her
eternal
welfare
was
not
dearer
to
him
than
anything
on
earth
it
was
his
humility
the
terrible
impieties
that
burst
from
him
on
the
news
of
her
death
horrified
my
readers
but
not
as
on
reflection
they
horrified
him
who
had
uttered
them
for
a
long
time
during
his
novitiate
he
was
oppressed
with
religious
despair
he
thought
he
must
have
committed
that
sin
against
the
holy
spirit
which
dooms
the
soul
for
ever
by
degrees
that
dark
cloud
cleared
away
anselmo
juvante
but
deep
remained
he
felt
his
own
salvation
insecure
and
moreover
thought
it
would
be
mocking
heaven
should
he
the
deeply
stained
pray
for
a
soul
so
innocent
comparatively
as
margaret
so
he
used
to
coax
good
anselm
and
another
kindly
monk
to
pray
for
her
they
did
not
refuse
nor
do
it
by
halves
in
general
the
good
old
monks
and
there
were
good
bad
and
indifferent
in
every
convent
had
a
pure
and
tender
affection
for
their
younger
brethren
which
in
truth
was
not
of
this
world
clement
then
having
preached
on
sunday
morning
in
a
small
italian
town
and
being
mightily
carried
onward
was
greatly
encouraged
and
that
day
a
balmy
sense
of
god
forgiveness
and
love
descended
on
him
and
he
prayed
for
the
welfare
of
margaret
soul
and
from
that
hour
this
became
his
daily
habit
and
the
one
purified
tie
that
by
memory
connected
his
heart
with
earth
for
his
family
were
to
him
as
if
they
had
never
been
the
church
would
not
share
with
earth
nor
could
even
the
church
cure
the
great
love
without
annihilating
the
smaller
ones
during
most
of
this
journey
clement
rarely
felt
any
spring
of
life
within
him
but
when
he
was
in
the
pulpit
the
other
exceptions
were
when
he
happened
to
relieve
some
a
young
man
was
tarantula
bitten
or
perhaps
like
many
more
fancied
it
fancy
or
reality
he
had
been
for
two
days
without
sleep
and
in
most
extraordinary
convulsions
leaping
twisting
and
beating
the
walls
the
village
musicians
had
only
excited
him
worse
with
their
music
exhaustion
and
death
followed
the
disease
when
it
gained
such
a
head
clement
passed
by
and
learned
what
was
the
matter
he
sent
for
a
psaltery
and
tried
the
patient
with
soothing
melodies
but
if
the
other
tunes
maddened
him
clement
seemed
to
crush
him
he
groaned
and
moaned
under
them
and
grovelled
on
the
floor
at
last
the
friar
observed
that
at
intervals
his
lips
kept
going
he
applied
his
ear
and
found
the
patient
was
whispering
a
tune
and
a
very
singular
one
that
had
no
existence
he
learned
this
tune
and
played
it
the
patient
face
brightened
amazingly
he
marched
about
the
room
on
the
light
fantastic
toe
enjoying
it
and
when
clement
fingers
ached
nearly
off
with
playing
it
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
young
man
sink
complacently
to
sleep
to
this
lullaby
the
strange
creation
of
his
own
mind
for
it
seems
he
was
no
musician
and
never
composed
a
tune
before
or
after
this
sleep
saved
his
life
and
clement
after
teaching
the
tune
to
another
in
case
it
should
be
wanted
again
went
forward
with
his
heart
a
little
warmer
on
another
occasion
he
found
a
mob
haling
a
decently
dressed
man
along
who
struggled
and
vociferated
but
in
a
strange
language
this
person
had
walked
into
their
town
erect
and
sprightly
waving
a
mulberry
branch
over
his
head
thereupon
the
natives
first
gazed
stupidly
not
believing
their
eyes
then
pounced
on
him
and
dragged
him
before
the
podesta
clement
went
with
them
but
on
the
way
drew
quietly
near
the
prisoner
and
spoke
to
him
in
italian
no
answer
in
french
german
dutch
no
assets
then
the
man
tried
clement
in
tolerable
latin
but
with
a
sharpish
accent
he
said
he
was
an
englishman
and
oppressed
with
the
heat
of
italy
had
taken
a
bough
off
the
nearest
tree
to
save
his
head
in
my
country
anybody
is
welcome
to
what
grows
on
the
highway
confound
the
fools
i
am
ready
to
pay
for
it
but
here
is
all
italy
up
in
arms
about
a
twig
and
a
handful
of
the
podesta
would
have
sent
the
dogged
islander
to
prison
but
clement
mediated
and
with
some
difficulty
made
the
prisoner
comprehend
that
silkworms
and
by
consequence
mulberry
leaves
were
sacred
being
under
the
wing
of
the
sovereign
and
his
source
of
income
and
urged
on
the
podesta
that
ignorance
of
his
mulberry
laws
was
natural
in
a
distant
country
where
the
very
tree
perhaps
was
unknown
the
opinionative
islander
turned
the
still
vibrating
scale
by
pulling
out
a
long
purse
and
repeating
his
original
theory
that
the
whole
question
was
mercantile
quid
damni
said
he
dic
et
cito
the
podesta
snuffed
the
gold
fined
him
a
ducat
for
the
duke
about
the
value
of
the
whole
tree
and
pouched
the
coin
the
englishman
shook
off
his
ire
the
moment
he
was
liberated
and
laughed
heartily
at
the
whole
thing
but
was
very
grateful
to
clement
you
are
too
good
for
this
hole
of
a
country
father
said
he
come
to
england
that

the
only
place
in
the
world
i
was
an
uneasy
fool
to
leave
it
and
wander
among
mulberries
and
their
idiots
i
am
a
kentish
squire
and
educated
at
cambridge
university

with

and

heirs
if
you
will
come
now
what
an
englishman
says
he
and
he
gave
him
a
great
hearty
grip
of
the
hand
to
confirm
it
i
will
visit
thee
some
day
my
son
said
clement
but
not
to
weary
thy
the
englishman
then
begged
clement
to
shrive
him
i
know
not
what
will
become
of
my
soul
said
he
i
live
like
a
heathen
since
i
left
clement
consented
gladly
and
soon
the
islander
was
on
his
knees
to
him
by
the
roadside
confessing
the
last
month
sins
finding
him
so
pious
a
son
of
the
church
clement
let
him
know
he
was
really
coming
to
england
he
then
asked
him
whether
it
was
true
that
country
was
overrun
with
lollards
and
wickliffites
the
other
coloured
up
a
little
there
be
black
sheep
in
every
land
said
he
then
after
some
reflection
he
said
gravely
holy
father
hear
the
truth
about
these
heretics
none
are
better
disposed
towards
holy
church
than
we
english
but
we
are
ourselves
and
by
ourselves
we
love
our
own
ways
and
above
all
our
own
tongue
the
norman
could
conquer
our
but
not
our
tongues
and
hard
they
tried
it
for
many
a
long
year
by
law
and
proclamation
our
good
foreign
priests
utter
god
to
plain
english
folk
in
latin
or
in
some
french
or
italian
lingo
like
the
bleating
of
a
sheep
then
come
the
fox
wickliff
and
his
crew
and
read
him
out
of
his
own
book
in
plain
english
that
all
men
hearts
warm
to
who
can
withstand
this
god
forgive
me
i
believe
the
english
would
turn
deaf
ears
to
st
peter
himself
spoke
he
not
to
them
in
the
tongue
their
mothers
sowed
in
their
ears
and
their
hearts
along
with
mothers
he
added
hastily
i
say
not
this
for
myself
i
am
cambridge
bred
and
good
words
come
not
amiss
to
me
in
latin
but
for
the
people
in
general
clavis
ad
corda
anglorum
est
lingua
my
son
said
clement
blessed
be
the
hour
i
met
thee
for
thy
words
are
sober
and
wise
but
alas
how
shall
i
learn
your
english
tongue
no
book
have
i
would
give
you
my
book
of
hours
father
is
in
english
and
latin
cheek
by
jowl
but
then
what
would
become
of
my
poor
soul
wanting
my
in
a
strange
land
stay
you
are
a
holy
man
and
i
am
an
honest
one
let
us
make
a
bargain
you
to
pray
for
me
every
day
for
two
months
and
i
to
give
you
my
book
of
hours
here
it
is
what
say
you
to
that
and
his
eyes
sparkled
and
he
was
all
on
fire
with
mercantility
clement
smiled
gently
at
this
trait
and
quietly
detached
a
from
his
girdle
and
showed
him
that
it
was
in
latin
and
italian
see
my
son
said
he
heaven
hath
foreseen
our
several
needs
and
given
us
the
means
to
satisfy
them
let
us
change
books
and
my
dear
son
i
will
give
thee
my
poor
prayers
and
welcome
not
sell
them
thee
i
love
not
religious
the
islander
was
delighted
so
shall
i
learn
the
italian
tongue
without
risk
to
my
eternal
weal
near
is
my
purse
but
nearer
is
my
he
forced
money
on
clement
in
vain
the
friar
told
him
it
was
contrary
to
his
vow
to
carry
more
of
that
than
was
barely
necessary
lay
it
out
for
the
good
of
the
church
and
of
my
soul
said
the
islander
i
ask
you
not
to
keep
it
but
take
it
you
must
and
and
he
grasped
clement
hand
warmly
again
and
clement
kissed
him
on
the
brow
and
blessed
him
and
they
went
each
his
way
about
a
mile
from
where
they
parted
clement
found
two
tired
wayfarers
lying
in
the
deep
shade
of
a
great
one
of
a
thick
grove
the
road
skirted
near
the
men
was
a
little
cart
and
in
it
a
rude
and
clumsy
as
a
a
jaded
mule
was
harnessed
to
the
cart
and
so
clement
stood
face
to
face
with
his
old
enemy
and
as
he
eyed
it
and
the
honest
faces
of
the
wearied
craftsmen
he
looked
back
as
on
a
dream
at
the
bitterness
he
had
once
felt
towards
this
machine
he
looked
kindly
down
on
them
and
said
softly
sweynheim
the
men
started
to
their
feet
pannartz
they
scuttled
into
the
wood
and
were
seen
no
more
clement
was
amazed
and
stood
puzzling
himself
presently
a
face
peeped
from
behind
a
tree
clement
addressed
it
what
fear
ye
a
quavering
voice
replied
say
rather
by
what
magic
you
a
stranger
can
call
us
by
our
names
i
never
clapt
eyes
on
you
till
o
superstition
i
know
ye
as
all
good
workmen
are
known
by
your
works
come
hither
and
i
will
tell
they
advanced
gingerly
from
different
sides
each
regulating
his
advance
by
the
other
my
children
said
clement
i
saw
a
lactantius
in
rome
printed
by
sweynheim
and
pannartz
disciples
of
d
hear
that
pannartz
our
work
has
gotten
to
rome
by
your
blue
eyes
and
flaxen
hair
i
wist
ye
were
germans
and
the
spoke
for
itself
who
then
should
ye
be
but
disciples
pannartz
and
sweynheim
the
honest
germans
were
now
astonished
that
they
had
suspected
magic
in
so
simple
a
matter
the
good
father
hath
his
wits
about
him
that
is
all
said
pannartz
ay
said
sweynheim
and
with
those
wits
would
he
could
tell
us
how
to
get
this
tired
beast
to
the
next
yea
said
sweynheim
and
where
to
find
money
to
pay
for
his
meat
and
ours
when
we
get
i
will
try
said
clement
free
the
mule
of
the
cart
and
of
all
harness
but
the
bare
this
was
done
and
the
animal
immediately
lay
down
and
rolled
on
his
back
in
the
dust
like
a
kitten
whilst
he
was
thus
employed
clement
assured
them
he
would
rise
up
a
new
mule
his
creator
hath
taught
him
this
art
to
refresh
himself
which
the
nobler
horse
knoweth
not
now
with
regard
to
money
know
that
a
worthy
englishman
hath
entrusted
me
with
a
certain
sum
to
bestow
in
charity
to
whom
can
i
better
give
a
stranger
money
than
to
strangers
take
it
then
and
be
kind
to
some
englishman
or
other
stranger
in
his
need
and
may
all
nations
learn
to
love
one
another
one
the
tears
stood
in
the
honest
workmen
eyes
they
took
the
money
with
heartfelt
thanks
it
is
your
nation
we
are
bound
to
thank
and
bless
good
father
if
we
but
knew
my
nation
is
the
clement
was
then
for
bidding
them
farewell
but
the
honest
fellows
implored
him
to
wait
a
little
they
had
no
silver
nor
gold
but
they
had
something
they
could
give
their
benefactor
they
took
the
press
out
of
the
cart
and
while
clement
fed
the
mule
they
hustled
about
now
on
the
white
hot
road
now
in
the
deep
cool
shade
now
half
in
and
half
out
and
presently
printed
a
quarto
sheet
of
eight
pages
which
was
already
set
up
they
had
not
type
enough
to
print
two
sheets
at
a
time
when
after
the
slower
preliminaries
the
printed
sheet
was
pulled
all
in
a
moment
clement
was
amazed
in
turn
what
are
all
these
words
really
fast
upon
the
paper
said
he
is
it
verily
certain
they
will
not
go
as
swiftly
as
they
came
and
you
took
me
for
a
magician
is
de
civitate
dei
my
sons
you
carry
here
the
very
wings
of
knowledge
oh
never
abuse
this
great
craft
print
no
ill
books
they
would
fly
abroad
countless
as
locusts
and
lay
waste
men
the
workmen
said
they
would
sooner
put
their
hands
under
the
screw
than
so
abuse
their
goodly
craft
and
so
they
parted
there
is
nothing
but
meeting
and
parting
in
this
world
at
a
town
in
tuscany
the
holy
friar
had
a
sudden
and
strange
recontre
with
the
past
he
fell
in
with
one
of
those
motley
assemblages
of
patricians
and
plebeians
piety
and
profligacy
a
company
of
pilgrims
a
subject
too
well
painted
by
others
for
me
to
go
and
daub
they
were
in
an
immense
barn
belonging
to
the
inn
clement
dusty
and
wearied
and
no
lover
of
idle
gossip
sat
in
a
corner
studying
the
englishman
hours
and
making
them
out
as
much
by
his
own
dutch
as
by
the
latin
version
presently
a
servant
brought
a
bucket
half
full
of
water
and
put
it
down
at
his
feet
a
female
servant
followed
with
two
towels
and
then
a
woman
came
forward
and
crossing
herself
kneeled
down
without
a
word
at
the
removed
her
sleeves
entirely
and
motioned
to
him
to
put
his
feet
into
the
water
it
was
some
lady
of
rank
doing
penance
she
wore
a
mask
scarce
an
inch
broad
but
effectual
moreover
she
handled
the
friar
feet
more
delicately
than
those
do
who
are
born
to
such
offices
these
penances
were
not
uncommon
and
clement
though
he
had
little
faith
in
this
form
of
contrition
received
the
services
of
the
incognita
as
a
matter
of
course
but
presently
she
sighed
deeply
and
with
her
heartfelt
sigh
and
her
head
bent
low
over
her
menial
office
she
seemed
so
bowed
with
penitence
that
he
pitied
her
and
said
calmly
but
gently
can
i
aught
for
your
soul
weal
my
daughter
she
shook
her
head
with
a
faint
sob
nought
holy
father
nought
only
to
hear
the
sin
of
her
who
is
most
unworthy
to
touch
thy
holy
feet
is
part
of
my
penance
to
tell
sinless
men
how
vile
i
speak
my
father
said
the
lady
bending
lower
and
lower
these
hands
of
mine
look
white
but
they
are
stained
with
blood
the
blood
of
the
man
i
loved
alas
you
withdraw
your
foot
ah
me
what
shall
i
do
all
holy
things
shrink
from
culpa
mea
culpa
mea
said
clement
eagerly
my
daughter
it
was
an
unworthy
movement
of
earthly
weakness
for
which
i
shall
do
penance
judge
not
the
church
by
her
feebler
servants
not
her
foot
but
her
bosom
is
offered
to
thee
repenting
truly
take
courage
then
and
purge
thy
conscience
of
its
on
this
the
lady
in
a
trembling
whisper
and
hurriedly
and
cringing
a
little
as
if
she
feared
the
church
would
strike
her
bodily
for
what
she
had
done
made
this
confession
he
was
a
stranger
and
but
beautiful
as
spring
and
wise
beyond
his
years
i
loved
him
i
had
not
the
prudence
to
conceal
my
love
nobles
courted
me
i
thought
one
of
humble
birth
could
reject
me
i
showed
him
my
heart
oh
shame
of
my
sex
he
drew
back
yet
he
admired
me
but
innocently
he
loved
another
and
he
was
constant
i
resorted
to
a
woman
wiles
they
availed
not
i
borrowed
the
wickedness
of
men
and
threatened
his
life
and
to
tell
his
true
lover
he
died
false
to
her
ah
you
shrink
your
foot
trembles
am
i
not
a
monster
then
he
wept
and
prayed
to
me
for
mercy
then
my
good
angel
helped
me
i
bade
him
leave
rome
gerard
gerard
why
did
you
not
obey
me
i
thought
he
was
gone
but
two
months
after
this
i
met
him
never
shall
i
forget
it
i
was
descending
the
tiber
in
my
galley
when
he
came
up
it
with
a
gay
company
and
at
his
side
a
woman
beautiful
as
an
angel
but
bold
and
bad
that
woman
claimed
me
aloud
for
her
rival
traitor
and
hypocrite
he
had
exposed
me
to
her
and
to
all
the
loose
tongues
in
rome
in
terror
and
revenge
i
bravo
when
he
was
gone
on
his
bloody
errand
i
wavered
too
late
the
dagger
i
had
hired
struck
he
never
came
back
to
his
lodgings
he
was
dead
alas
perhaps
he
was
not
so
much
to
blame
none
have
ever
cast
his
name
in
my
teeth
his
poor
body
is
not
found
or
i
should
kiss
its
wounds
and
slay
myself
upon
it
all
around
his
very
name
seems
silent
as
the
grave
to
which
this
murderous
hand
hath
sent
clement
eye
was
drawn
by
her
movement
he
recognized
her
shapely
arm
and
soft
white
hand
and
oh
he
was
so
young
to
die
a
poor
thoughtless
boy
that
had
fallen
a
victim
to
that
bad
arts
and
she
had
made
him
tell
her
everything
monster
of
cruelty
what
penance
can
avail
me
oh
holy
father
what
shall
i
do
clement
lips
moved
in
prayer
but
he
was
silent
he
could
not
see
his
duty
clear
then
she
took
his
feet
and
began
to
dry
them
she
rested
his
foot
upon
her
soft
arm
and
pressed
it
with
the
towel
so
gently
she
seemed
incapable
of
hurting
a
fly
yet
her
lips
had
just
told
another
story
and
a
true
one
while
clement
was
still
praying
for
wisdom
a
tear
fell
upon
his
foot
it
decided
him
my
daughter
said
he
i
myself
have
been
a
great
you
father
i
quite
as
great
a
sinner
as
thou
though
not
in
the
same
way
the
devil
has
gins
and
snares
as
well
as
traps
but
penitence
softened
my
impious
heart
and
then
gratitude
remoulded
it
therefore
seeing
you
penitent
i
hope
you
can
be
grateful
to
him
who
has
been
more
merciful
to
you
than
you
have
to
your
daughter
the
church
sends
you
comfort
to
me
ah
never
unless
it
can
raise
my
victim
from
the
take
this
crucifix
in
thy
hand
fix
thine
eyes
on
it
and
listen
to
me
was
all
the
reply
yes
father
but
let
me
thoroughly
dry
your
feet
first
is
ill
sitting
in
wet
feet
and
you
are
the
holiest
man
of
all
whose
feet
i
have
washed
i
know
it
by
your
woman
i
am
not
as
for
my
feet
they
can
wait
their
turn
obey
thou
me
yes
father
said
the
lady
humbly
but
with
a
woman
evasive
pertinacity
she
wreathed
one
towel
swiftly
round
the
foot
she
was
drying
and
placed
his
other
foot
on
the
dry
napkin
then
obeyed
his
command
and
as
she
bowed
over
the
crucifix
the
low
solemn
tones
of
the
friar
fell
upon
her
ear
and
his
words
soon
made
her
whole
body
quiver
with
various
emotion
in
quick
succession
my
daughter
he
you
murdered
in
intent
was
one
gerard
a
hollander
he
loved
a
creature
as
men
should
love
none
but
their
redeemer
and
his
church
heaven
chastised
him
a
letter
came
to
rome
she
was
poor
gerard
poor
margaret
moaned
the
penitent
clement
voice
faltered
at
this
a
moment
but
soon
by
a
strong
effort
he
recovered
all
his
calmness
his
feeble
nature
yielded
body
and
soul
to
the
blow
he
was
stricken
down
with
fever
he
revived
only
to
rebel
against
heaven
he
said
is
no
god
poor
poor
gerard
poor
gerard
thou
feeble
foolish
woman
nay
wicked
impious
gerard
he
plunged
into
vice
and
soiled
his
eternal
jewel
those
you
met
him
with
were
his
daily
companions
but
know
rash
creature
that
the
seeming
woman
you
took
to
be
his
leman
was
but
a
boy
dressed
in
habits
to
flout
the

he
fell
into
despair
and
bent
on
destroying

stood
one

by

resolved
on

he
saw
one
watching

coldly
he
you

gerard
needs
nothing
man
can
do
for
him
saved
by
a
miracle
from
double
death
he
has
left

taken
refuge
from
sin
and
folly
in
the
bosom
of
the

a
priest

a

then
you
are
not
his
confessor

you
know
all
that
gentle
voice
she
raised
her
head
slowly
and
peered
at
him
through
her
mask
the
next
moment
she
uttered
a
faint
shriek
and
lay
with
her
brow
upon
his
bare
feet
chapter
lxxv
clement
sighed
he
began
to
doubt
whether
he
had
taken
the
wisest
course
with
a
creature
so
passionate
but
young
as
he
was
he
had
already
learned
many
lessons
of
ecclesiastical
wisdom
for
one
thing
he
had
been
taught
to
pause
in
certain
difficulties
neither
to
do
nor
to
say
anything
until
the
matter
should
clear
itself
a
little
he
therefore
held
his
peace
and
prayed
for
wisdom
all
he
did
was
gently
to
withdraw
his
foot
but
his
penitent
flung
her
arms
round
it
with
a
piteous
cry
and
held
it
convulsively
and
wept
over
it
and
now
the
agony
of
shame
as
well
as
penitence
she
was
in
showed
itself
by
the
bright
red
that
crept
over
her
very
throat
as
she
lay
quivering
at
his
feet
my
daughter
said
clement
gently
take
courage
torment
thyself
no
more
about
this
gerard
who
is
not
as
for
me
i
am
brother
clement
whom
heaven
hath
sent
to
thee
this
day
to
comfort
thee
and
help
thee
save
thy
soul
thou
last
made
me
thy
confessor
i
claim
then
thine
oh
yes
sobbed
the
penitent
leave
this
pilgrimage
and
instant
return
to
rome
penitence
abroad
is
little
worth
there
where
we
live
lie
the
temptations
we
must
defeat
or
perish
not
fly
in
search
of
others
more
showy
but
less
lethal
easy
to
wash
the
feet
of
strangers
masked
ourselves
hard
to
be
merely
meek
and
charitable
with
those
about
i
never
never
lay
finger
on
her
nay
i
speak
not
of
servants
only
but
of
dependents
kinsmen
friends
this
be
thy
penance
the
last
thing
at
night
and
the
first
thing
after
matins
call
to
mind
thy
sin
and
god
his
goodness
and
so
be
humble
and
gentle
to
the
faults
of
those
around
thee
the
world
it
courts
the
rich
but
seek
thou
the
poor
not
beggars
these
for
the
most
are
neither
honest
nor
truly
poor
but
rather
find
out
those
who
blush
to
seek
thee
yet
need
thee
sore
giving
to
them
shalt
lend
to
heaven
marry
a
good
son
of
the
me
i
will
never
thou
wilt
marry
within
the
year
i
do
entreat
and
command
thee
to
marry
one
that
feareth
god
for
thou
art
very
clay
mated
ill
thou
shalt
be
naught
but
wedding
a
worthy
husband
thou
mayest

live
a
pious
princess
ay
and
die

i
he
then
desired
her
to
rise
and
go
about
the
good
work
he
had
set
her
she
rose
to
her
knees
and
removing
her
mask
cast
an
eloquent
look
upon
him
then
lowered
her
eyes
meekly
i
will
obey
you
as
i
would
an
angel
how
happy
i
am
yet
unhappy
for
oh
my
heart
tells
me
i
shall
never
look
on
you
again
i
will
not
go
till
i
have
dried
your
it
needs
not
i
have
excused
thee
this
bootless
is
no
penance
to
me
ah
you
do
not
forgive
me
if
you
will
not
let
me
dry
your
poor
so
be
it
then
said
clement
resignedly
and
thought
to
himself
levius
quid
but
these
weak
creatures
that
gravitate
towards
the
small
as
heavenly
bodies
towards
the
great
have
yet
their
own
flashes
of
angelic
intelligence
when
the
princess
had
dried
the
friar
feet
she
looked
at
him
with
tears
in
her
beautiful
eyes
and
murmured
with
singular
tenderness
and
goodness
i
will
have
masses
said
for
her
soul
may
i
she
added
timidly
this
brought
a
faint
blush
into
the
monk
cheek
and
moistened
his
cold
blue
eye
it
came
so
suddenly
from
one
he
was
just
rating
so
low
it
is
a
gracious
thought
he
said
do
as
thou
wilt
often
such
acts
fall
back
on
the
doer
like
blessed
dew
i
am
thy
confessor
not
hers
thine
is
the
soul
i
must
now
do
my
all
to
save
or
woe
be
to
my
own
my
daughter
my
dear
daughter
i
see
good
and
ill
angels
fighting
for
thy
soul
this
day
ay
this
moment
oh
fight
thou
on
thine
own
side
dost
thou
remember
all
i
bade
thee
remember
said
the
princess
sweet
saint
each
syllable
of
thine
is
graved
in
my
but
one
word
more
then
pray
much
to
christ
and
little
to
his
i
and
that
is
the
best
word
i
have
light
to
say
to
thee
so
part
we
on
it
thou
to
the
place
becomes
thee
best
thy
father
house
i
to
my
holy
mother
adieu
faltered
the
princess
adieu
thou
that
i
have
loved
too
well
hated
too
ill
known
and
revered
too
late
forgiving
angel
adieu
for
the
monk
caught
her
words
though
but
faltered
in
a
sigh
for
ever
he
cried
aloud
with
sudden
ardour
christians
live
ever
and
love
ever
but
they
never
part
ever
they
part
as
part
the
earth
and
sun
to
meet
more
brightly
in
a
little
while
you
and
i
part
here
for
life
and
what
is
our
life
one
line
in
the
great
story
of
the
church
whose
son
and
daughter
we
are
one
handful
in
the
sand
of
time
one
drop
in
the
ocean
of
ever
adieu
for
the
little
moment
called
life
we
part
in
trouble
we
shall
meet
in
peace
we
part
creatures
of
clay
we
shall
meet
immortal
spirits
we
part
in
a
world
of
sin
and
sorrow
we
shall
meet
where
all
is
purity
and
love
divine
where
no
ill
passions
are
but
christ
is
and
his
saints
around
him
clad
in
white
there
in
the
turning
of
an
in
the
breaking
of
a
bubble
in
the
passing
of
a
cloud
she
and
thou
and
i
shall
meet
again
and
sit
at
the
feet
of
angels
and
archangels
apostles
and
saints
and
beam
like
them
with
joy
unspeakable
in
the
light
of
the
shadow
of
god
upon
his
throne
for
ever
and
ever
and
and
so
they
parted
the
monk
erect
his
eyes
turned
heavenwards
and
glowing
with
the
sacred
fire
of
zeal
the
princess
slowly
retiring
and
turning
more
than
once
to
cast
a
lingering
glance
of
awe
and
tender
regret
on
that
inspired
figure
she
went
home
subdued
and
purified
clement
in
due
course
reached
basle
and
entered
on
his
duties
teaching
in
the
university
and
preaching
in
the
town
and
neighbourhood
he
led
a
life
that
can
be
comprised
in
two
words
deep
study
and
mortification
my
reader
has
already
a
peep
into
his
soul
at
basle
he
advanced
in
holy
zeal
and
knowledge
the
brethren
of
his
order
began
to
see
in
him
a
descendant
of
the
saints
and
martyrs
chapter
lxxvi
the
hearth
when
little
gerard
was
nearly
three
months
old
a
messenger
came
hot
from
tergou
for
catherine
now
just
you
go
back
said
she
and
tell
them
i
ca
come
and
i
wo
they
have
got
kate
so
he
departed
and
catherine
continued
her
sentence
there
child
i
must
go
they
are
all
at
sixes
and
sevens
this
is
the
third
time
of
asking
and
my
man
would
come
himself
and
take
me
home
by
the
ear
with
a
flea
she
then
recapitulated
her
experiences
of
infants
and
instructed
margaret
what
to
do
in
each
coming
emergency
and
pressed
money
upon
her
margaret
declined
it
with
thanks
catherine
insisted
and
turned
angry
margaret
made
excuses
all
so
reasonable
that
catherine
rejected
them
with
calm
contempt
to
her
mind
they
lacked
femininity
come
out
with
your
heart
said
she
and
you
and
me
parting
and
mayhap
shall
never
see
one
another
face
oh
mother
say
not
alack
girl
i
have
seen
it
so
often
come
into
my
mind
now
at
each
parting
when
i
was
your
age
i
never
had
such
a
thought
nay
we
were
all
to
live
for
ever
then
so
out
wi
well
then
mother
i
would
rather
not
have
told
you
your
cornelis
must
say
to
me
you
are
come
to
share
with
us
eh
mistress
those
were
his
words
i
told
him
i
would
be
very
sorry
beshrew
his
ill
tongue
what
signifies
it
he
will
never
know
most
likely
he
would
sooner
or
later
but
whether
or
no
i
will
take
no
grudged
bounty
from
any
family
unless
i
saw
my
child
starving
and
heaven
only
knows
what
i
might
do
nay
mother
give
me
but
thy
love
i
do
prize
that
above
silver
and
they
grudge
me
not
that
by
all
i
can
find
for
not
a
stiver
of
money
will
i
take
out
of
your
you
are
a
foolish
lass
why
were
it
me
i
take
it
just
to
spite
no
you
would
not
you
and
i
are
apples
off
one
tree
catherine
yielded
with
a
good
grace
and
when
the
actual
parting
came
embraces
and
tears
burst
forth
on
both
sides
when
she
was
gone
the
child
cried
a
good
deal
and
all
attempts
to
pacify
him
failing
margaret
suspected
a
pin
and
searching
between
his
clothes
and
his
skin
found
a
gold
angel
incommoding
his
backbone
there
now
gerard
said
she
to
the
babe
i
thought
granny
gave
in
rather
she
took
the
coin
and
wrapped
it
in
a
piece
of
linen
and
laid
it
at
the
bottom
of
her
box
bidding
the
infant
observe
she
could
be
at
times
as
resolute
as
granny
herself
catherine
told
eli
of
margaret
foolish
pride
and
how
she
had
baffled
it
eli
said
margaret
was
right
and
she
was
wrong
catherine
tossed
her
head
eli
pondered
margaret
was
not
without
domestic
anxieties
she
had
still
two
men
to
feed
and
could
not
work
so
hard
as
she
had
done
she
had
enough
to
do
to
keep
the
house
and
the
child
and
cook
for
them
all
but
she
had
a
little
money
laid
by
and
she
used
to
tell
her
child
his
father
would
be
home
to
help
them
before
it
was
spent
and
with
these
bright
hopes
and
that
treasury
of
bliss
her
boy
she
spent
some
happy
months
time
wore
on
and
no
gerard
came
and
stranger
still
no
news
of
him
then
her
mind
was
disquieted
and
contrary
to
her
nature
which
was
practical
she
was
often
lost
in
sad
reverie
and
sighed
in
silence
and
while
her
heart
was
troubled
her
money
was
melting
and
so
it
was
that
one
day
she
found
the
cupboard
empty
and
looked
in
her
faces
and
at
the
sight
of
them
her
bosom
was
all
pity
and
she
appealed
to
the
baby
whether
she
could
let
grandfather
and
poor
old
martin
want
a
meal
and
went
and
took
out
catherine
angel
as
she
unfolded
the
linen
a
tear
of
gentle
mortification
fell
on
it
she
sent
martin
out
to
change
it
while
he
was
gone
a
frenchman
came
with
one
of
the
dealers
in
illuminated
work
who
had
offered
her
so
poor
a
price
he
told
her
he
was
employed
by
his
sovereign
to
collect
masterpieces
for
her
book
of
hours
then
she
showed
him
the
two
best
things
she
had
and
he
was
charmed
with
one
of
them
the
flowers
and
raspberries
and
creeping
things
which
margaret
van
eyck
had
shaded
he
offered
her
an
price
nay
flout
not
my
need
good
stranger
said
she
three
mouths
there
be
in
this
house
and
none
to
fill
them
but
curious
arithmetic
left
out
no
i
out
thee
not
fair
mistress
my
princess
charged
me
strictly
the
best
craftsmen
but
i
will
no
hard
bargains
make
them
content
with
me
and
me
with
them
the
next
minute
margaret
was
on
her
knees
kissing
little
gerard
in
the
cradle
and
showering
four
gold
pieces
on
him
again
and
again
and
relating
the
whole
occurrence
to
him
in
very
broken
dutch
and
oh
what
a
good
princess
was
she
we
will
pray
for
her
we
my
lambkin
when
we
are
old
enough
martin
came
in
furious
they
will
not
change
it
i
trow
they
think
i
stole
i
am
beholden
to
thee
said
margaret
hastily
and
almost
snatched
it
from
martin
and
wrapped
it
up
again
and
restored
it
to
its
ere
these
unexpected
funds
were
spent
she
got
to
her
ironing
and
starching
again
in
the
midst
of
which
martin
sickened
and
died
after
an
illness
of
nine
days
nearly
all
her
money
went
to
bury
him
decently
he
was
gone
and
there
was
an
empty
chair
by
her
fireside
for
he
had
preferred
the
hearth
to
the
sun
as
soon
as
the
busy
body
was
gone
margaret
would
not
allow
anybody
to
sit
in
this
chair
now
yet
whenever
she
let
her
eye
dwell
too
long
on
it
vacant
it
was
sure
to
cost
her
a
tear
and
now
there
was
nobody
to
carry
her
linen
home
to
do
it
herself
she
must
leave
little
gerard
in
charge
of
a
neighbour
but
she
dared
not
trust
such
a
treasure
to
mortal
and
besides
she
could
not
bear
him
out
of
her
sight
for
hours
and
hours
so
she
set
inquiries
on
foot
for
a
boy
to
carry
her
basket
on
saturday
and
monday
a
plump
youth
called
luke
peterson
who
looked
fifteen
but
was
eighteen
came
in
and
blushing
and
twiddling
his
bonnet
asked
her
if
a
man
would
not
serve
her
turn
as
well
as
a
boy
before
he
spoke
she
was
saying
to
herself
this
boy
will
just
but
she
took
the
cue
and
said
nay
but
a
man
will
maybe
seek
more
than
i
can
well
pay
not
i
said
luke
warmly
why
mistress
margaret
i
am
your
neighbour
and
i
do
very
well
at
the
coopering
i
can
carry
your
basket
for
you
before
or
after
my
day
work
and
welcome
you
have
no
need
to
pay
me
anything
is
as
if
we
were
strangers
ye
why
master
luke
i
know
your
face
for
that
matter
but
i
can
not
call
to
mind
that
ever
a
word
passed
between
oh
yes

did
mistress
margaret
what
have
you
forgotten
one
day
you
were
trying
to
carry
your
baby
and
eke
your
pitcher
full
o
water
and
quo
i
me
the
baby
to
carry
says
you
give
you
the
pitcher
and
keep
the
bairn
myself
and
i
carried
the
pitcher
home
and
you
took
it
from
me
at
this
door
and
you
said
to
me
am
muckle
obliged
to
you
young
man
with
such
a
sweet
voice
not
like
the
folk
in
this
street
speak
to
a
i
do
mind
now
master
luke
and
methinks
it
was
the
least
i
could
well
mistress
margaret
if
you
will
say
as
much
every
time
i
carry
your
basket
i
care
not
how
often
i
bear
it
nor
how
nay
nay
said
margaret
colouring
faintly
i
would
not
put
upon
good
nature
you
are
young
master
luke
and
kindly
say
i
give
you
your
supper
on
saturday
night
when
you
bring
the
linen
home
and
your
o
monday
would
that
make
us
anyways
even
as
you
please
only
say
not
i
sought
a
couple
o
diets
for
such
a
trifle
as
with
luke
timely
assistance
and
the
health
and
strength
which
heaven
gave
this
poor
young
woman
to
balance
her
many
ills
the
house
went
pretty
smoothly
awhile
but
the
heart
became
more
and
more
troubled
by
gerard
long
and
now
most
mysterious
silence
and
then
that
mental
torturer
suspense
began
to
tear
her
heavy
heart
with
his
hot
pincers
till
she
cried
often
and
vehemently
oh
that
i
could
know
the
whilst
she
was
in
this
state
one
day
she
heard
a
heavy
step
mount
the
stair
she
started
and
trembled
that
is
no
step
that
i
know
ill
tidings
the
door
opened
and
an
unexpected
visitor
eli
came
in
looking
grave
and
kind
margaret
eyed
him
in
silence
and
with
increasing
agitation
said
he
the
skipper
is
come
one
word
gasped
margaret
is
he
alive
surely
i
hope
so
no
one
has
seen
him
then
they
must
have
seen
him
no
girl
neither
dead
nor
alive
hath
he
been
seen
this
many
months
in
rome
my
daughter
kate
thinks
he
is
gone
to
some
other
city
she
bade
me
tell
you
her
ay
like
enough
said
margaret
gloomily
like
enough
my
poor
babe
the
old
man
in
a
faintish
voice
asked
her
for
a
morsel
to
eat
he
had
come
fasting
the
poor
thing
pitied
him
with
the
surface
of
her
agitated
mind
and
cooked
a
meal
for
him
trembling
and
scarce
knowing
what
she
was
about
ere
he
went
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
head
and
said
be
he
alive
or
be
he
dead
i
look
on
thee
as
my
daughter
can
i
do
nought
for
thee
this
day
bethink
thee
now
ay
old
man
pray
for
him
and
for
me
eli
sighed
and
went
sadly
and
heavily
down
the
stairs
she
listened
half
stupidly
to
his
retiring
footsteps
till
they
ceased
then
she
sank
moaning
down
by
the
cradle
and
drew
little
gerard
tight
to
her
bosom
oh
my
poor
fatherless
boy
my
fatherless
boy
chapter
lxxvii
not
long
after
this
as
the
little
family
at
tergou

at

in
on
them

with
dust

did
wait
for
holy
saints
he
has
come
home
kate
nay
she
would
sure
have
said
so
what
on
earth
can
it
be
and
she
heaped
conjecture
on
conjecture
mayhap
the
young
man
can
tell
us
hazarded
kate
timidly
that
i
can
said
luke
why
her
babe
is
and
she
was
so
wrapped
up
in
it
catherine
started
up
what
is
his
trouble
nay
i
know
not
but
it
has
been
peaking
and
pining
worse
and
worse
this
a
furtive
glance
of
satisfaction
passed
between
cornelis
and
sybrandt
luckily
for
them
catherine
did
not
see
it
her
face
was
turned
towards
her
husband
now
eli
cried
she
furiously
if
you
say
a
word
against
it
you
and
i
shall
quarrel
after
all
these
years
who
gainsays
thee
foolish
woman

with
your
own
shadow
while
i
go

peter

good
man

thee

never
yet

me
at
a
pinch

dinners
who

while
i
go
and
make
she
took
luke
back
with
her
in
the
cart
and
on
the
way
questioned
and
him
severely
and
seductively
by
turns
till
she
had
turned
his
mind
inside
out
what
there
was
of
it
margaret
met
her
at
the
door
pale
and
agitated
and
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
looked
imploringly
in
her
face
come
he
is
alive
thank
god
said
catherine
after
scanning
her
eagerly
she
looked
at
the
failing
child
and
then
at
the
poor
mother
alternately
lucky
you
sent
for
me
said
she
the
child
is
poisoned
by
whom
by
you
you
have
been
nay
indeed
mother
how
can
i
help
fretting
do
tell
me
margaret
a
nursing
mother
has
no
business
to
fret
she
must
turn
her
mind
away
from
her
grief
to
the
comfort
that
lies
in
her
lap
know
you
not
that
the
child
pines
if
the
mother
vexes
herself
this
comes
of
your
reading
and
writing
those
idle
crafts
befit
a
man
but
they
keep
all
useful
knowledge
out
of
a
woman
the
child
must
be
oh
you
cruel
woman
cried
margaret
vehemently
i
am
sorry
i
sent
for
you
would
you
rob
me
of
the
only
bit
of
comfort
i
have
in
the
world
my
gerard
i
forget
i
am
the
most
unhappy
creature
beneath
the
that
you
do
not
was
the
retort
or
he
would
not
be
the
way
he
mother
said
margaret
imploringly
is
hard
replied
catherine
relenting
but
bethink
thee
would
it
not
be
harder
to
look
down
and
see
his
lovely
wee
face
up
at
you
out
of
a
little
coffin
oh
jesu
and
how
could
you
face
your
other
troubles
with
your
heart
aye
full
and
your
lap
empty
oh
mother
i
consent
to
anything
only
save
my
that
is
a
good
lass
trust
to
me
i
do
stand
by
and
see
clearer
than
unfortunately
there
was
another
consent
to
be
gained
the
babe
and
he
was
more
refractory
than
his
mother
there
said
margaret
trying
to
affect
regret
at
his
misbehaviour
he
loves
me
too
but
catherine
was
a
match
for
them
both
as
she
came
along
she
had
observed
a
healthy
young
woman
sitting
outside
her
own
door
with
an
infant
hard
by
she
went
and
told
her
the
case
and
would
she
nurse
the
pining
child
for
the
nonce
till
she
had
matters
ready
to
wean
him
the
young
woman
consented
with
a
smile
and
popped
her
child
into
the
cradle
and
came
into
margaret
house
she
dropped
a
curtsey
and
catherine
put
the
child
into
her
hands
she
examined
and
pitied
it
and
purred
over
it
and
proceeded
to
nurse
it
just
as
if
it
had
been
her
own
margaret
who
had
been
paralyzed
at
her
assurance
cast
a
rueful
look
at
catherine
and
burst
out
crying
the
visitor
looked
up
what
is
to
do
wife
ye
told
me
not
the
mother
was
she
is
not
she
is
only
a
fool
never
heed
her
and
you
margaret
i
am
ashamed
of
you
are
a
cruel
woman
sobbed
margaret
them
as
take
in
hand
to
guide
the
weak
need
be
hardish
and
you
will
excuse
me
but
you
are
not
my
flesh
and
blood
and
your
boy
after
giving
this
blunt
speech
time
to
sink
she
added
come
now
she
is
robbing
her
own
to
save
yours
and
you
can
think
of
nothing
better
than
bursting
out
in
the
woman
face
out
fie
for
shame
nay
wife
said
the
nurse
thank
heaven
i
have
enough
for
my
own
and
for
hers
to
boot
and
prithee
wyte
not
on
her
maybe
the
troubles
life
ha
soured
her
own
and
her
heart
into
the
bargain
said
the
remorseless
catherine
margaret
looked
her
full
in
the
face
and
down
went
her
eyes
i
know
i
ought
to
be
very
grateful
to
you
sobbed
margaret
to
the
nurse
then
turned
her
head
and
leaned
away
over
the
chair
not
to
witness
the
intolerable
sight
of
another
nursing
her
gerard
and
gerard
drawing
no
distinction
between
this
new
mother
and
her
the
banished
one
the
nurse
replied
you
are
very
welcome
my
poor
woman
and
so
are
you
mistress
catherine
which
are
my
townswoman
and
know
it
what
are
ye
from
tergou
all
the
better
but
i
can
not
call
your
face
to
oh
you
know
not
me
my
husband
and
me
we
are
very
humble
folk
by
you
but
true
eli
and
his
wife
are
known
of
all
the
town
and
respected
so
i
am
at
your
call
dame
and
at
yours
wife
and
yours
my
pretty
poppet
night
or
there
a
woman
of
the
right
old
sort
said
catherine
as
the
door
closed
upon
her
i
hate
her
i
hate
her
i
hate
her
said
margaret
with
wonderful
fervour
catherine
only
laughed
at
this
outburst
that
is
right
said
she
better
say
it
as
set
sly
and
think
it
it
is
very
natural
after
all
come
here
is
your
bundle
o
comfort
take
and
hate
that
if
ye
can
and
she
put
the
child
in
her
lap
no
no
said
margaret
turning
her
head
half
way
from
him
she
could
not
for
her
life
turn
the
other
half
he
is
not
my
child
now
he
is
hers
i
know
not
why
she
left
him
here
for
my
part
it
was
very
good
of
her
not
to
take
him
to
her
house
cradle
and
all
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
ah
well
one
comfort
he
is
not
dead
this
gives
me
light
some
other
woman
has
got
him
away
from
me
like
father
like
son
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
catherine
was
sorry
for
her
and
let
her
cry
in
peace
and
after
that
when
she
wanted
joan
aid
she
used
to
take
gerard
out
to
give
him
a
little
fresh
air
margaret
never
objected
nor
expressed
the
least
incredulity
but
on
their
return
was
always
in
tears
this
connivance
was
she
was
now
altogether
as
eager
to
wean
little
gerard
it
was
done
and
he
recovered
health
and
vigour
and
another
trouble
fell
upon
him
directly
teething
but
here
experience
was
invaluable
and
now
in
the
midst
of
her
grief
and
anxiety
about
the
father
margaret
had
moments
of
bliss
watching
the
son
tiny
teeth
come
through
teeth
mother
i
call
them
not
teeth
but
pearls
of
and
each
pearl
that
peeped
and
sparkled
on
his
red
gums
was
to
her
the
greatest
feat
nature
had
ever
achieved
her
companion
partook
the
illusion
and
had
we
told
them
standing
corn
was
equally
admirable
margaret
would
have
changed
to
a
reproachful
gazelle
and
catherine
turned
us
out
of
doors
so
each
pearl
arrival
was
announced
with
a
shriek
of
triumph
by
whichever
of
them
was
the
fortunate
discoverer
catherine
gossiped
with
joan
and
learned
that
she
was
the
wife
of
jorian
ketel
of
tergou
who
had
been
servant
to
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
but
fallen
out
of
favour
and
come
back
to
rotterdam
his
native
place
his
friends
had
got
him
the
place
of
sexton
to
the
parish
and
what
with
that
and
carpentering
he
did
pretty
well
catherine
told
joan
in
return
whose
child
it
was
she
had
nursed
and
all
about
margaret
and
gerard
and
the
deep
anxiety
his
silence
had
plunged
them
in
ay
said
joan
the
world
is
full
of
one
day
she
said
to
catherine
it
my
belief
my
man
knows
more
about
your
gerard
than
anybody
in
these
parts
but
he
has
got
to
be
closer
than
ever
of
late
drop
in
some
day
just
afore
sunset
and
set
him
talking
and
for
our
lady
sake
say
not
i
set
you
on
the
only
hiding
he
ever
gave
me
was
for
babbling
his
business
and
i
do
not
want
another
gramercy
i
married
a
man
for
the
comfort
of
the
thing
not
to
be
catherine
dropped
in
jorian
was
ready
enough
to
tell
her
how
he
had
befriended
her
son
and
perhaps
saved
his
life
but
this
was
no
news
to
catherine
and
the
moment
she
began
to
him
as
to
whether
he
could
guess
why
her
lost
boy
neither
came
nor
wrote
he
cast
a
grim
look
at
his
wife
who
received
it
with
a
calm
air
of
stolid
candour
and
innocent
unconsciousness
and
his
answers
became
short
and
sullen
what
should
he
know
more
than
another
and
so
on
he
added
after
a
pause
think
you
the
burgomaster
takes
such
as
me
into
his
secrets
oh
then
the
burgomaster
knows
something
said
catherine
sharply
likely
who
else
should
i
ask
i
and
tell
him
you
say
he
that
is
right
dame
go
make
him
mine
enemy
that
is
what
a
poor
fellow
always
gets
if
he
says
a
word
to
you
and
jorian
from
that
moment
shrunk
in
and
became
impenetrable
as
a
hedgehog
and
almost
as
prickly
his
conduct
caused
both
the
poor
women
agonies
of
mind
alarm
and
irritated
curiosity
ghysbrecht
was
for
some
cause
gerard
mortal
enemy
had
stopped
his
marriage
imprisoned
him
hunted
him
and
here
was
his
late
servant
who
when
off
his
guard
had
hinted
that
this
enemy
had
the
clue
to
gerard
silence
after
sifting
jorian
every
word
and
look
all
remained
dark
and
mysterious
then
catherine
told
margaret
to
go
herself
to
him
you
are
young
you
are
fair
you
will
maybe
get
more
out
of
him
than
i
the
conjecture
was
a
reasonable
one
margaret
went
with
her
child
in
her
arms
and
tapped
timidly
at
door
just
before
sunset
come
in
said
a
sturdy
voice
she
entered
and
there
sat
jorian
by
the
fireside
at
sight
of
her
he
rose
snorted
and
burst
out
of
the
house
is
that
for
me
wife
inquired
margaret
turning
very
red
you
must
excuse
him
replied
joan
rather
coldly
he
lays
it
to
your
door
that
he
is
a
poor
man
instead
of
a
rich
one
it
is
something
about
a
piece
of
parchment
there
was
one
amissing
and
he
got
nought
from
the
burgomaster
all
along
of
that
alas
gerard
took
likely
but
my
man
says
you
should
not
have
let
him
you
were
pledged
to
him
to
keep
them
all
safe
and
sooth
to
say
i
blame
not
my
jorian
for
being
wroth
is
hard
for
a
poor
man
to
be
so
near
fortune
and
lose
it
by
those
he
has
befriended
however
i
tell
him
another
story
says
i
that
are
out
o
trouble
like
you
and
me
did
ought
to
be
too
hard
on
folk
that
are
in
trouble
and
she
has
plenty
going
already
what
is
all
your
hurry
mistress
oh
it
is
not
for
me
to
drive
the
goodman
out
of
his
own
well
let
me
kiss
the
bairn
afore
ye
go
he
is
not
in
fault
anyway
poor
upon
this
cruel
rebuff
margaret
came
to
a
resolution
which
she
did
not
confide
even
to
catherine
after
six
weeks
stay
that
good
woman
returned
home
on
the
child
birthday
which
occurred
soon
after
margaret
did
no
work
but
put
on
her
sunday
clothes
and
took
her
boy
in
her
arms
and
went
to
the
church
and
prayed
there
long
and
fervently
for
gerard
safe
return
that
same
day
and
hour
father
clement
celebrated
a
mass
and
prayed
for
margaret
departed
soul
in
the
minster
church
at
basle
chapter
lxxviii
some
blackguard
or
other
i
think
it
was
sybrandt
said
a
lie
is
not
like
a
blow
with
a
curtal
true
for
we
can
predict
in
some
degree
the
consequences
of
a
stroke
with
any
material
weapon
but
a
lie
has
no
bounds
at
all
the
nature
of
the
thing
is
to
ramify
beyond
human
calculation
often
in
the
everyday
world
a
lie
has
cost
a
life
or
laid
waste
two
or
three
and
so
in
this
story
what
tremendous
consequences
of
that
one
heartless
falsehood
yet
the
tellers
reaped
little
from
it
the
brothers
who
invented
it
merely
to
have
one
claimant
the
less
for
their
father
property
saw
little
gerard
take
their
brother
place
in
their
mother
heart
nay
more
one
day
eli
openly
proclaimed
that
gerard
being
lost
and
probably
dead
he
had
provided
by
will
for
little
gerard
and
also
for
margaret
his
poor
son
widow
at
this
the
look
that
passed
between
the
black
sheep
was
a
caution
to
traitors
cornelis
had
it
on
his
lips
to
say
gerard
was
most
likely
alive
but
he
saw
his
mother
looking
at
him
and
checked
himself
in
time
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
the
other
partner
in
that
lie
was
now
a
failing
man
he
saw
the
period
fast
approaching
when
all
his
wealth
would
drop
from
his
body
and
his
misdeeds
cling
to
his
soul
too
intelligent
to
deceive
himself
entirely
he
had
never
been
free
from
gusts
of
remorse
in
taking
gerard
letter
to
margaret
he
had
compounded
i
can
not
give
up
land
and
money
said
his
giant
avarice
i
will
cause
her
no
unnecessary
pain
said
his
dwarf
conscience
so
after
first
tampering
with
the
seal
and
finding
there
was
not
a
syllable
about
the
deed
he
took
it
to
her
with
his
own
hand
and
made
a
merit
of
it
to
himself
a
and
on
a
scale
not
uncommon
where
the
is
the
judge
the
birth
of
margaret
child
surprised
and
shocked
him
and
put
his
treacherous
act
in
a
new
light
should
his
letter
take
effect
he
should
cause
the
dishonour
of
her
who
was
the
daughter
of
one
friend
the
granddaughter
of
another
and
whose
land
he
was
keeping
from
her
too
these
thoughts
preying
on
him
at
that
period
of
life
when
the
strength
of
body
decays
and
the
memory
of
old
friends
revives
filled
him
with
gloomy
horrors
yet
he
was
afraid
to
confess
for
the
cure
was
an
honest
man
and
would
have
made
him
disgorge
and
with
him
avarice
was
an
ingrained
habit
penitence
only
a
sentiment
matters
were
thus
when
one
day
returning
from
the
town
hall
to
his
own
house
he
found
a
woman
waiting
for
him
in
the
vestibule
with
a
child
in
her
arms
she
was
veiled
and
so
concluding
she
had
something
to
be
ashamed
of
he
addressed
her
magisterially
on
this
she
let
down
her
veil
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
it
was
margaret
brandt
her
sudden
appearance
and
manner
startled
him
and
he
could
not
conceal
his
confusion
where
is
my
gerard
cried
she
her
bosom
heaving
is
he
alive
for
aught
i
know
stammered
ghysbrecht
i
hope
so
for
your
sake
prithee
come
into
this
room
the
servants
not
a
step
said
margaret
and
she
took
him
by
the
shoulder
and
held
him
with
all
the
energy
of
an
excited
woman
you
know
the
secret
of
that
which
is
breaking
my
heart
why
does
not
my
gerard
come
nor
send
a
line
this
many
months
answer
me
or
all
the
town
is
like
to
hear
me
let
alone
thy
servants
my
misery
is
too
great
to
be
sported
in
vain
he
persisted
he
knew
nothing
about
gerard
she
told
him
those
who
had
sent
her
to
him
told
her
another
tale
you
do
know
why
he
neither
comes
nor
sends
said
she
firmly
at
this
ghysbrecht
turned
paler
and
paler
but
he
summoned
all
his
dignity
and
said
would
you
believe
those
two
knaves
against
a
man
of
worship
what
two
knaves
said
she
keenly
he
stammered
said
ye
not
there
i
am
a
poor
old
broken
man
whose
memory
is
shaken
and
you
come
here
and
confuse
me
so
i
know
not
what
i
ay
sir
your
memory
is
shaken
or
sure
you
would
not
be
my
enemy
my
father
saved
you
from
the
plague
when
none
other
would
come
anigh
you
and
was
ever
your
friend
my
grandfather
floris
helped
you
in
your
early
poverty
and
loved
you
man
and
boy
three
generations
of
us
you
have
seen
and
here
is
the
fourth
of
us
this
is
your
old
friend
grandchild
and
your
old
friend
floris
his
look
down
on
his
innocent
face
and
think
of
theirs
woman
you
torture
me
sighed
ghysbrecht
and
sank
upon
a
bench
but
she
saw
her
advantage
and
kneeled
before
him
and
put
the
boy
on
his
knees
this
fatherless
babe
is
poor
margaret
brandt
that
never
did
you
ill
and
comes
of
a
race
that
loved
you
nay
look
at
his
face
melt
thee
more
than
any
word
of
mine
saints
of
heaven
what
can
a
poor
desolate
girl
and
her
babe
have
done
to
wipe
out
all
memory
of
thine
own
young
days
when
thou
wert
guiltless
as
he
is
that
now
looks
up
in
thy
face
and
implores
thee
to
give
him
back
his
father
and
with
her
arms
under
the
child
she
held
him
up
higher
and
higher
smiling
under
the
old
man
eyes
he
cast
a
wild
look
of
anguish
on
the
child
and
another
on
the
kneeling
mother
and
started
up
shrieking
avaunt
ye
pair
of
the
stung
soul
gave
the
old
limbs
a
momentary
vigour
and
he
walked
rapidly
wringing
his
hands
and
clutching
at
his
white
hair
forget
those
days
i
forget
all
else
oh
woman
woman
sleeping
or
waking
i
see
but
the
faces
of
the
dead
i
hear
but
the
voices
of
the
dead
and
i
shall
soon
be
among
the
dead
there
there
what
is
done
is
done
i
am
in
hell
i
am
in
and
unnatural
force
ended
in
prostration
he
staggered
and
but
for
margaret
would
have
fallen
with
her
one
disengaged
arm
she
supported
him
as
well
as
she
could
and
cried
for
help
a
couple
of
servants
came
running
and
carried
him
away
in
a
state
bordering
on
syncope
the
last
margaret
saw
of
him
was
his
old
furrowed
face
white
and
helpless
as
his
hair
that
hung
down
over
the
elbow
heaven
forgive
me
she
said
i
doubt
i
have
killed
the
poor
old
then
this
attempt
to
penetrate
the
torturing
mystery
left
it
as
dark
or
darker
than
before
for
when
she
came
to
ponder
every
word
her
suspicion
was
confirmed
that
ghysbrecht
did
know
something
about
gerard
and
who
were
the
two
knaves
he
thought
had
done
a
good
deed
and
told
me
oh
my
gerard
my
poor
deserted
babe
you
and
i
are
wading
in
deep
the
visit
to
tergou
took
more
money
than
she
could
well
afford
and
a
customer
ran
away
in
her
debt
she
was
once
more
compelled
to
unfold
catherine
angel
but
strange
to
say
as
she
came
down
stairs
with
it
in
her
hand
she
found
some
loose
silver
on
the
table
with
a
written
line
for
gerard
his
wife
she
fell
with
a
cry
of
surprise
on
the
writing
and
soon
it
rose
into
a
cry
of
joy
he
is
alive
he
sends
me
this
by
some
friendly
she
kissed
the
writing
again
and
again
and
put
it
in
her
bosom
time
rolled
on
and
no
news
of
gerard
and
about
every
two
months
a
small
sum
in
silver
found
its
way
into
the
house
sometimes
it
lay
on
the
table
once
it
was
flung
in
through
the
bedroom
window
in
a
purse
once
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
luke
basket
he
had
stopped
at
the
to
talk
to
a
friend
the
giver
or
his
agent
was
never
detected
catherine
disowned
it
margaret
van
eyck
swore
she
had
no
hand
in
it
so
did
eli
and
margaret
whenever
it
came
used
to
say
to
little
gerard
oh
my
poor
deserted
child
you
and
i
are
wading
in
deep
she
applied
at
least
half
this
modest
but
useful
supply
to
dressing
the
little
gerard
beyond
his
station
in
life
if
it
does
come
from
gerard
he
shall
see
his
boy
all
the
mothers
in
the
street
began
to
sneer
especially
such
as
had
brats
out
at
elbows
the
months
rolled
on
and
dead
sickness
of
heart
succeeded
to
these
keener
torments
she
returned
to
her
first
thought
gerard
must
be
dead
she
should
never
see
her
boy
father
again
nor
her
marriage
this
last
grief
which
had
been
somewhat
allayed
by
eli
and
catherine
recognizing
her
betrothal
now
revived
in
full
force
others
would
not
look
so
favourably
on
her
story
and
often
she
moaned
over
her
boy
illegitimacy
is
it
not
enough
for
us
to
be
bereaved
must
we
be
dishonoured
too
oh
that
we
had
been
a
change
took
place
in
peter
brandt
his
mind
clouded
for
nearly
two
years
seemed
now
to
be
clearing
he
had
intervals
of
intelligence
and
then
he
and
margaret
used
to
talk
of
gerard
till
he
wandered
again
but
one
day
returning
after
an
absence
of
some
hours
margaret
found
him
conversing
with
catherine
in
a
way
he
had
never
done
since
his
paralytic
stroke
eh
girl
why
must
you
be
out
said
she
but
indeed
i
have
told
him
all
and
we
have
been
together
over
thy
margaret
stood
silent
looking
joyfully
from
one
to
the
other
peter
smiled
on
her
and
said
come
let
me
bless
she
kneeled
at
his
feet
and
he
blessed
her
most
eloquently
he
told
her
she
had
been
all
her
life
the
lovingest
truest
and
most
obedient
daughter
heaven
ever
sent
to
a
poor
old
widowed
man
may
thy
son
be
to
thee
what
thou
hast
been
to
me
after
this
he
dozed
then
the
females
whispered
together
and
catherine
said
all
our
talk
now
was
of
gerard
it
lies
heavy
on
his
mind
his
poor
head
must
often
have
listened
to
us
when
it
seemed
quite
dark
margaret
he
is
a
very
understanding
man
he
thought
of
many
things
may
be
in
prison
says
he
forced
to
go
fighting
for
some
king
or
sent
to
constantinople
to
copy
books
there
or
gone
into
the
church
after
all
he
had
a
bent
that
ah
mother
whispered
margaret
in
reply
he
doth
but
deceive
himself
as
we
ere
she
could
finish
the
sentence
a
strange
interruption
occurred
a
loud
voice
cried
out
i
see
him
i
see
and
the
old
man
with
dilating
eyes
seemed
to
be
looking
right
through
the
wall
of
the
house
in
a
boat
on
a
great
river
coming
this
way
sore
disfigured
but
i
knew
him
gone
gone
all
and
he
sank
back
and
asked
feebly
where
was
margaret
dear
father
i
am
by
thy
side
oh
mother
mother
what
is
this
i
can
not
see
thee
and
but
a
moment
agone
i
saw
all
round
the
world
ay
ay
well
i
am
ready
is
this
thy
hand
bless
thee
my
child
bless
thee
weep
not
the
tree
is
the
old
physician
read
the
signs
aright
these
calm
words
were
his
last
the
next
moment
he
drooped
his
head
and
gently
placidly
drifted
away
from
earth
like
an
infant
sinking
to
rest
the
torch
had
flashed
up
before
going
out
chapter
lxxix
she
who
had
wept
for
poor
old
martin
was
not
likely
to
bear
this
blow
so
stoically
as
the
death
of
the
old
is
apt
to
be
borne
in
vain
catherine
tried
to
console
her
with
commonplaces
in
vain
told
her
it
was
a
happy
release
for
him
and
that
as
he
himself
had
said
the
tree
was
ripe
but
her
worst
failure
was
when
she
urged
that
there
were
now
but
two
mouths
to
feed
and
one
care
the
less
such
cares
are
all
the
joys
i
have
said
margaret
they
fill
my
desolate
heart
which
now
seems
void
as
well
as
waste
oh
empty
chair
my
bosom
it
aches
to
see
thee
poor
old
man
how
could
i
love
him
by
halves
i
that
did
use
to
sit
and
look
at
him
and
think
for
me
thou
wouldst
die
of
hunger
he
so
wise
so
learned
erst
was
got
to
be
helpless
as
my
own
sweet
babe
and
i
loved
him
as
if
he
had
been
my
child
instead
of
my
father
oh
empty
chair
oh
empty
heart
and
the
pious
tears
would
not
be
denied
then
catherine
held
her
peace
and
hung
her
head
and
one
day
she
made
this
confession
i
speak
to
thee
out
o
my
head
and
not
out
o
my
bosom
thou
dost
well
to
be
deaf
to
me
were
i
in
thy
place
i
should
mourn
the
old
man
all
one
as
thou
then
margaret
embraced
her
and
this
bit
of
true
sympathy
did
her
a
little
good
the
commonplaces
did
none
then
catherine
bowels
yearned
over
her
and
she
said
my
poor
girl
you
were
not
born
to
live
alone
i
have
got
to
look
on
you
as
my
own
daughter
waste
not
thine
youth
upon
my
son
gerard
either
he
is
dead
or
he
is
a
traitor
it
cuts
my
heart
to
say
it
but
who
can
help
seeing
it
thy
father
is
gone
and
i
can
not
always
be
aside
thee
and
here
is
an
honest
lad
that
loves
thee
well
this
many
a
day
i
take
him
and
comfort
together
heaven
hath
sent
us
these
creatures
to
torment
us
and
comfort
us
and
all
we
are
just
nothing
in
the
world
without
then
seeing
margaret
look
utterly
perplexed
she
went
on
to
say
why
sure
you
are
not
so
blind
as
not
to
see
it
what
who
who
but
this
luke
what
our
luke
the
boy
that
carries
my
basket
nay
he
is
over
nineteen
and
a
fine
healthy
lad
and
i
have
made
inquiries
for
you
and
they
all
do
say
he
is
a
capable
workman
and
never
touches
a
drop
and
that
is
much
in
a
rotterdam
lad
which
they
are
mostly
half
man
half
margaret
smiled
for
the
first
time
this
many
days
luke
loves
dried
puddings
dearly
said
she
and
i
make
them
to
his
mind
is
them
he
comes
then
she
suddenly
turned
red
but
if
i
thought
he
came
after
your
son
wife
that
is
or
ought
to
be
i
soon
put
him
to
the
nay
nay
for
heaven
sake
let
me
not
make
mischief
poor
lad
why
girl
fancy
will
not
be
bridled
bless
you
i
wormed
it
out
of
him
near
a
twelvemonth
oh
mother
and
you
let
him
well
i
thought
of
you
i
said
to
myself
he
is
fool
enough
to
be
her
slave
for
nothing
all
the
better
for
her
a
lone
woman
is
lost
without
a
man
about
her
to
fetch
and
carry
her
little
matters
but
now
my
mind
is
changed
and
i
think
the
best
use
you
can
put
him
to
is
to
marry
so
then
his
own
mother
is
against
him
and
would
wed
me
to
the
first
comer
an
gerard
thou
hast
but
me
i
will
not
believe
thee
dead
till
i
see
thy
tomb
nor
false
till
i
see
thee
with
another
lover
in
thine
hand
foolish
boy
i
shall
be
civil
to
him
afflicted
with
the
busybody
protection
luke
peterson
met
a
cold
reception
in
the
house
where
he
had
hitherto
found
a
gentle
and
kind
one
and
finding
himself
very
little
spoken
to
at
all
and
then
sharply
and
irritably
the
great
soft
fellow
fell
to
whimpering
and
asked
margaret
plump
if
he
had
done
anything
to
offend
her
nothing
i
am
to
blame
i
am
curst
if
you
will
take
my
counsel
you
will
keep
out
of
my
way
it
is
all
along
of
me
luke
said
the
busybody
you
mistress
catherine
why
what
have
i
done
for
you
to
set
her
against
me
nay
i
meant

the
best
i
told

i
saw
you
were
looking
towards
her
through
a
wedding
ring
but
she
wo

no
need
to
tell
her
that
wife
she
knows

am
courting

said
margaret
or
i

the
street
door
to

said
luke
tenderly
then
you
have
seen
the
last
of
them
how
dare
you
talk
so
to
another
man
wife
and
him
far
away
she
ended
gently
but
very
firmly
you

not
trouble
yourself
to
come
here
any
more
luke
i
can
carry
my
basket
oh
very
well
said
luke
and
after
sitting
silent
and
stupid
for
a
little
while
he
rose
and
said
sadly
to
catherine
dame
i
daresay
i
have
got
the
sack
and
went
out
but
the
next
saturday
catherine
found
him
seated
on
the
doorstep
blubbering
he
told
her
he
had
got
used
to
come
there
and
every
other
place
seemed
strange
she
went
in
and
told
margaret
and
margaret
sighed
and
said
poor
luke
he
might
come
in
for
her
if
he
could
know
his
place
and
treat
her
like
a
married
on
this
being
communicated
to
luke
he
hesitated
pshaw
said
catherine
promises
are
promise
her
all
the
world
sooner
than
sit
outside
like
a
fool
when
a
word
will
carry
you
inside
now
you
humour
her
in
everything
and
then
if
poor
gerard
come
not
home
and
claim
her
you
will
be
sure
to
have
her
in
time
a
lone
woman
is
aye
to
be
tired
out
thou
foolish

the
cloister
brother
clement
had
taught
and
preached
in
basle
more
than
a
twelvemonth
when
one
day
jerome
stood
before
him
dusty
with
a
triumphant
glance
in
his
eye
give
the
glory
to
god
brother
clement
thou
canst
now
wend
to
england
with
i
am
ready
brother
jerome
and
expecting
thee
these
many
months
have
in
the
intervals
of
teaching
and
devotion
studied
the
english
tongue
somewhat
was
well
thought
of
said
jerome
he
then
told
him
he
had
but
delayed
till
he
could
obtain
extraordinary
powers
from
the
pope
to
collect
money
for
the
church
use
in
england
and
to
hear
confession
in
all
the
secular
monasteries
so
now
gird
up
thy
loins
and
let
us
go
forth
and
deal
a
good
blow
for
the
church
and
against
the
the
two
friars
went
preaching
down
the
rhine
for
england
in
the
larger
places
they
both
preached
at
the
smaller
they
often
divided
and
took
different
sides
of
the
river
and
met
again
at
some
appointed
spot
both
were
able
orators
but
in
different
styles
jerome
was
noble
and
impressive
but
a
little
contracted
in
religious
topics
and
a
trifle
monotonous
in
delivery
compared
with
clement
though
in
truth
not
so
compared
with
most
preachers
clement
was
full
of
variety
and
often
remarkably
colloquial
in
its
general
flow
tender
and
gently
winning
it
curled
round
the
reason
and
the
heart
but
it
always
rose
with
the
rising
thought
and
so
at
times
clement
soared
as
far
above
jerome
as
his
level
speaking
was
below
him
indeed
in
these
noble
heats
he
was
all
that
we
hue
read
of
inspired
prophet
or
heathen
orator
vehemens

would
give
literal
specimens
but
for
five
objections
it
is
difficult
time
is
short
i
have
done
it
elsewhere
an
able
imitator
has
since
done
it
better
and
similarity
a
virtue
in
peas
is
a
vice
in
books
but
not
to
evade
the
matter
entirely
clement
used
secretly
to
try
and
learn
the
recent
events
and
the
besetting
sin
of
each
town
he
was
to
preach
in
but
jerome
the
unbending
scorned
to
go
out
of
his
way
for
any
vices
at
one
great
town
some
leagues
from
the
rhine
they
mounted
the
same
pulpit
in
turn
jerome
preached
against
vanity
in
dress
a
favourite
theme
of
his
he
was
eloquent
and
satirical
and
the
people
listened
with
complacency
it
was
a
vice
that
they
were
little
given
to
clement
preached
against
drunkenness
it
was
a
besetting
sin
and
sacred
from
preaching
in
these
parts
for
the
clergy
themselves
were
infected
with
it
and
popular
prejudice
protected
it
clement
dealt
it
merciless
blows
out
of
holy
writ
and
worldly
experience
a
crime
itself
it
was
the
nursing
mother
of
most
crimes
especially
theft
and
murder
he
reminded
them
of
a
parricide
that
had
lately
been
committed
in
their
town
by
all
honest
man
in
liquor
and
also
how
a
band
of
drunkards
had
roasted
one
of
their
own
comrades
alive
at
a
neighbouring
village
your
last
prince
said
he
is
reported
to
have
died
of
apoplexy
but
well
you
know
he
died
of
drink
and
of
your
aldermen
one
perished
miserably
last
month
dead
drunk
suffocated
in
a
puddle
your
children
backs
go
bare
that
you
may
fill
your
bellies
with
that
which
makes
you
the
worst
of
beasts
silly
as
calves
yet
fierce
as
boars
and
drives
your
families
to
need
and
your
souls
to
hell
i
tell
ye
your
town
ay
and
your
very
nation
would
sink
to
the
bottom
of
mankind
did
your
women
drink
as
you
do
and
how
long
will
they
be
temperate
and
contrary
to
nature
resist
the
example
of
their
husbands
and
fathers
vice
yet
stood
still
ye
must
amend
yourselves
or
see
them
come
down
to
your
mark
already
in
bohemia
they
drink
along
with
the
men
how
shows
a
drunken
woman
would
you
love
to
see
your
wives
drunken
your
mothers
drunken
at
this
there
was
a
shout
of
horror
for
mediaeval
audiences
had
not
learned
to
sit
mumchance
at
a
moving
sermon
ah
that
comes
home
to
you
cried
the
friar
what
madmen
think
you
it
doth
not
more
shock
the
god
to
see
a
man
his
noblest
work
turned
to
a
drunken
beast
than
it
can
shock
you
creatures
of
sin
and
unreason
to
see
a
woman
turned
into
a
thing
no
better
nor
worse
than
he
ended
with
two
pictures
a
drunkard
house
and
family
and
a
sober
man
both
so
true
and
dramatic
in
all
their
details
that
the
wives
fell
all
to
ohing
and
ahing
and
eh
but
that
is
a
true
this
discourse
caused
quite
all
uproar
the
hearers
formed
knots
the
men
were
indignant
so
the
women
flattered
them
and
took
their
part
openly
against
the
preacher
a
married
man
had
a
right
to
a
drop
he
needed
it
working
for
all
the
family
and
for
their
part
they
did
not
care
to
change
their
men
for
milksops
the
double
faces
that
very
evening
a
hand
of
men
caught
near
a
hundred
of
them
round
brother
clement
filling
his
wallet
with
the
best
and
offering
him
the
very
roses
off
their
heads
and
kissing
his
frock
and
blessing
him
for
taking
in
hand
to
mend
their
jerome
thought
this
sermon
too
earthly
drunkenness
is
not
heresy
clement
that
a
whole
sermon
should
be
preached
against
as
they
went
on
he
found
to
his
surprise
that
clement
sermons
sank
into
his
hearers
deeper
than
his
own
made
them
listen
think
cry
and
sometimes
even
amend
their
ways
he
hath
the
art
of
sinking
to
their
peg
thought
jerome
yet
he
can
soar
high
enough
at
upon
the
whole
it
puzzled
jerome
who
had
a
secret
sense
of
superiority
to
his
tenderer
brother
and
after
about
two
hundred
miles
of
it
it
got
to
displease
him
as
well
as
puzzle
him
but
he
tried
to
check
this
sentiment
as
petty
and
unworthy
souls
differ
like
locks
said
he
and
preachers
must
differ
like
keys
or
the
fewer
should
the
church
open
for
god
to
pass
in
and
certes
this
novice
hath
the
key
to
these
northern
souls
being
himself
a
northern
and
so
they
came
slowly
down
the
rhine
sometimes
drifting
a
few
miles
down
the
stream
but
in
general
walking
by
the
banks
preaching
and
teaching
and
confessing
sinners
in
the
towns
and
villages
and
they
reached
the
town
of
dusseldorf
there
was
the
little
quay
where
gerard
and
denys
had
taken
boat
up
the
rhine
the
friars
landed
on
it
there
were
the
streets
there
was
the
silver
nothing
had
changed
but
he
who
walked
through
it
barefoot
with
his
heart
calm
and
cold
his
hands
across
his
breast
and
his
eyes
bent
meekly
on
the
ground
a
true
son
of
dominic
and
holy
church
chapter
lxxxi
the
hearth
eli
said
catherine
answer
me
one
question
like
a
man
and
i
ask
no
more
what
is
wormwood
eli
looked
a
little
helpless
at
this
sudden
demand
upon
his
faculties
but
soon
recovered
enough
to
say
it
was
something
that
tasted
main
bitter
that
is
a
fair
answer
my
man
but
not
the
one
i
look
then
answer
it
and
shall
wormwood
is
to
have
two
in
the
house
nought
but
waiting
for
thy
shoes
and
mine
eli
groaned
the
shaft
struck
home
methinks
waiting
for
their
best
friend
coffin
that
and
nothing
to
do
are
enow
to
make
them
worse
than
nature
meant
why
not
set
them
up
somewhere
to
give
a
chance
eli
said
he
was
willing
but
afraid
they
would
drink
and
gamble
their
very
shelves
away
nay
said
catherine
dost
take
me
for
a
simpleton
of
course
i
mean
to
watch
them
at
starting
and
drive
them
wi
a
loose
rein
as
the
saying
where
did
you
think
of
not
here
to
divide
our
own
not
likely
i
say
rotterdam
against
the
world
then
i
could
start
oh
the
true
motive
of
all
this
was
to
get
near
little
gerard
after
many
discussions
and
eager
promises
of
amendment
on
these
terms
from
cornelis
and
sybrandt
catherine
went
to
rotterdam
and
took
kate
with
her
for
a
change
they
soon
found
one
and
in
a
good
street
but
it
was
sadly
out
of
order
however
they
got
it
cheaper
for
that
and
instantly
set
about
brushing
it
up
fitting
proper
shelves
for
the
business
and
making
the
habitable
luke
peterson
was
always
asking
margaret
what
he
could
do
for
her
the
answer
used
to
be
in
a
sad
tone
nothing
luke
what
you
that
are
so
clever
can
you
think
of
nothing
for
me
to
do
for
you
nothing
luke
but
at
last
she
varied
the
reply
thus
if
you
could
make
something
to
help
my
sweet
sister
kate
the
slave
of
love
consented
joyfully
and
soon
made
kate
a
little
cart
and
cushioned
it
and
yoked
himself
into
it
and
at
eventide
drew
her
out
of
the
town
and
along
the
pleasant
boulevard
with
margaret
and
catherine
walking
beside
it
looked
a
happier
party
than
it
was
kate
for
one
enjoyed
it
keenly
for
little
gerard
was
put
in
her
lap
and
she
doted
on
him
and
it
was
like
a
cherub
carried
by
a
little
angel
or
a
rosebud
lying
in
the
cup
of
a
lily
so
the
vulgar
jeered
and
asked
luke
how
a
thistle
tasted
and
if
his
mistress
could
not
afford
one
with
four
legs
etc
luke
did
not
mind
these
jeers
but
kate
minded
them
for
him
thou
hast
made
the
cart
for
me
good
luke
said
she
was
much
i
did
ill
to
let
thee
draw
me
too
we
can
afford
to
pay
some
poor
soul
for
that
i
love
my
rides
and
to
carry
little
gerard
but
i
liever
ride
no
more
than
thou
be
mocked
much
i
care
for
their
tongues
said
luke
if
i
did
care
i
knock
their
heads
together
i
shall
draw
you
till
my
mistress
says
give
over
luke
if
you
obey
kate
you
will
oblige
then
i
will
obey
an
honourable
exception
to
popular
humour
was
jorian
ketel
wife
that
is
strength
well
laid
out
to
draw
the
weak
and
her
prayers
will
be
your
guerdon
she
is
not
long
for
this
world
she
smileth
in
these
were
the
words
of
joan
luke
answered
that
he
did
not
want
the
poor
lass
prayers
he
did
it
to
please
his
mistress
margaret
after
that
luke
often
pressed
margaret
to
give
him
something
to
do
without
success
but
one
day
as
if
tired
with
his
importuning
she
turned
on
him
and
said
with
a
look
and
accent
i
should
in
vain
try
to
convey
find
me
my
boy
chapter
lxxxii
mistress
they
all
say
he
is
not
so
they
feed
me
still
with
ay
to
your
face
but
behind
your
back
they
all
say
he
is
at
this
revelation
margaret
tears
began
to
flow
luke
whimpered
for
company
he
had
the
body
of
a
man
but
the
heart
of
a
girl
prithee
weep
not
so
sweet
mistress
said
he
i
bring
him
back
to
life
an
i
could
rather
than
see
thee
weed
so
margaret
said
she
thought
she
was
weeping
because
they
were
so
with
her
she
recovered
herself
and
laying
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
said
solemnly
luke
he
is
not
dead
dying
men
are
known
to
have
a
strange
sight
and
listen
luke
my
poor
father
when
he
was
and
i
simple
fool
was
so
happy
thinking
he
was
going
to
get
well
altogether
he
said
to
mother
and
me
he
was
sitting
in
that
very
chair
where
you
are
now
and
mother
was
as
might
be
here
and
i
was
yonder
making
a
sleeve
said
he
see
him
i
see
him
just
so
not
like
a
failing
man
at
all
but
all
o
fire
a
great
this
way
ah
luke
if
you
were
a
woman
and
had
the
feeling
for
me
you
think
you
have
you
would
pity
me
and
find
him
for
me
take
a
thought
the
father
of
my
child
alack
i
would
if
i
knew
how
said
luke
but
how
can
i
nay
of
course
you
can
not
i
am
mad
to
think
it
but
oh
if
any
one
really
cared
for
me
they
would
that
is
all
i
luke
reflected
in
silence
for
some
time
the
old
folk
all
say
dying
men
can
see
more
than
living
wights
let
me
think
for
my
mind
can
not
gallop
like
thine
on
a
great
river
well
the
maas
is
a
great
he
pondered
on
coming
this
way
then
if
it
was
the
maas
he
would
have
been
here
by
this
time
so
is
not
the
maas
the
rhine
is
a
great
river
greater
than
the
maas
and
very
long
i
think
it
will
be
the
and
so
do
i
luke
for
denys
bade
him
come
down
the
rhine
but
even
if
it
is
he
may
turn
off
before
he
comes
anigh
his
birthplace
he
does
not
pine
for
me
as
i
for
him
that
is
clear
luke
do
you
not
think
he
has
deserted
me
she
wanted
him
to
contradict
her
but
he
said
it
looks
very
like
it
what
a
fool
he
must
be
what
do
we
know
objected
margaret
imploringly
let
me
think
again
said
luke
i
can
not
the
result
of
this
meditation
was
this
he
knew
a
station
about
sixty
miles
up
the
rhine
where
all
the
public
boats
put
in
and
he
would
go
to
that
station
and
try
and
cut
the
truant
off
to
be
sure
he
did
not
even
know
him
by
sight
but
as
each
boat
came
in
he
would
mingle
with
the
passengers
and
ask
if
one
gerard
was
there
and
mistress
if
you
were
to
give
me
a
bit
of
a
letter
to
him
for
with
us
being
strangers
mayhap
a
wo
believe
a
word
i
good
kind
thoughtful
luke
i
will
how
i
have
undervalued
thee
but
give
me
till
to
get
it
at
supper
she
put
a
letter
into
his
hand
with
a
blush
it
was
a
long
letter
tied
round
with
silk
after
the
fashion
of
the
day
and
sealed
over
the
knot
luke
weighed
it
in
his
hand
with
a
shade
of
discontent
and
said
to
her
very
gravely
say
your
father
was
not
dreaming
and
say
i
have
the
luck
to
fall
in
with
this
man
and
say
he
should
turn
out
a
better
bit
of
stuff
than
i
think
him
and
come
home
to
you
then
and
there
what
is
to
become
o
me
margaret
coloured
to
her
very
brow
oh
luke
heaven
will
reward
thee
and
i
shall
fall
on
my
knees
and
bless
thee
and
i
shall
love
thee
all
my
days
sweet
luke
as
a
mother
does
her
son
i
am
so
old
by
thee
trouble
ages
the
heart
thou
shalt
not
go
is
not
fair
of
me
love
maketh
us
to
be
all
humph
said
luke
and
if
resumed
he
in
the
same
grave
way
yon
scapegrace
shall
read
thy
letter
and
hear
me
tell
him
how
thou
pinest
for
him
and
yet
being
a
traitor
or
a
mere
idiot
will
not
turn
to
thee
what
shall
become
of
me
then
must
i
die
a
bachelor
and
thou
fare
lonely
to
thy
grave
neither
maid
wife
nor
widow
margaret
panted
with
fear
and
emotion
at
this
terrible
piece
of
good
sense
and
the
plain
question
which
followed
it
but
at
last
she
faltered
out
if
which
our
lady
be
merciful
to
me
and
forbid
oh
well
mistress
if
he
should
read
my
letter
and
hear
thy
words
and
sweet
luke
be
just
and
tell
him
what
a
lovely
babe
he
hath
fatherless
fatherless
oh
luke
can
he
be
so
cruel
i
trow
not
but
if
then
he
will
give
thee
up
my
marriage
lines
and
i
shall
be
an
honest
woman
and
a
wretched
one
and
my
boy
will
not
be
a
bastard
and
of
course
then
we
could
both
go
into
any
honest
man
house
that
would
be
troubled
with
us
and
even
for
thy
goodness
this
day
i
will
i
will
be
so
ungrateful
as
go
past
thy
door
to
another
ay
but
will
you
come
in
at
mine
answer
me
that
oh
ask
me
not
some
day
perhaps
when
my
wounds
leave
bleeding
alas
i
try
if
i
do
fling
myself
and
my
child
into
the
maas
do
not
go
luke
do
not
think
of
going
is
all
madness
from
first
to
but
luke
was
as
slow
to
forego
an
idea
as
to
form
one
his
reply
showed
how
fast
love
was
making
a
man
of
him
well
said
he
madness
is
something
anyway
and
i
am
tired
of
doing
nothing
for
thee
and
i
am
no
great
talker
at
peep
of
day
i
start
but
hold
i
have
no
money
my
mother
she
takes
care
of
all
mine
and
i
see
it
then
margaret
took
out
catherine
gold
angel
which
had
escaped
so
often
and
gave
it
to
luke
and
he
set
out
on
his
mad
errand
it
did
not
however
seem
so
mad
to
him
as
to
us
it
was
a
superstitious
age
and
luke
acted
on
the
dying
man
dream
or
vision
or
illusion
or
whatever
it
was
much
as
we
should
act
on
respectable
information
but
catherine
was
downright
angry
when
she
heard
of
it
to
send
the
poor
lad
on
such
a
chase
but
you
are
like
a
many
more
girls
and
mark
my
words
by
the
time
you
have
worn
that
luke
fairly
out
and
made
him
as
sick
of
you
as
a
dog
you
will
turn
as
fond
on
him
as
a
cow
on
a
calf
and
late
will
be
the
the
cloister
the
two
friars
reached
holland
from
the
south
just
twelve
hours
after
luke
started
up
the
rhine
thus
chase
or
not
the
parties
were
nearing
each
other
and
rapidly
too
for
jerome
unable
to
preach
in
low
dutch
now
began
to
push
on
towards
the
coast
anxious
to
get
to
england
as
soon
as
possible
and
having
the
stream
with
them
the
friars
would
in
point
of
fact
have
missed
luke
by
passing
him
in
full
stream
below
his
station
but
for
the
incident
which
i
am
about
to
relate
about
twenty
miles
above
the
station
luke
was
making
for
clement
landed
to
preach
in
a
large
village
and
towards
the
end
of
his
sermon
he
noticed
a
grey
nun
weeping
he
spoke
to
her
kindly
and
asked
her
what
was
her
grief
nay
said
she
is
not
for
myself
flow
these
tears
is
for
my
lost
friend
thy
words
reminded
me
of
what
she
was
and
what
she
is
poor
wretch
but
you
are
a
dominican
and
i
am
a
franciscan
it
matters
little
my
sister
if
we
are
both
christians
and
if
i
can
aid
thee
in
the
nun
looked
in
his
face
and
said
these
are
strange
words
but
methinks
they
are
good
and
thy
lips
are
oh
most
eloquent
i
will
tell
thee
our
she
then
let
him
know
that
a
young
nun
the
darling
of
the
convent
and
her
bosom
friend
had
been
lured
away
from
her
vows
and
after
various
gradations
of
sin
was
actually
living
in
a
small
inn
as
chambermaid
in
reality
as
a
decoy
and
was
known
to
be
selling
her
favours
to
the
wealthier
customers
she
added
anywhere
else
we
might
by
kindly
violence
force
her
away
from
perdition
but
this
innkeeper
was
the
servant
of
the
fierce
baron
on
the
height
there
and
hath
his
ear
still
and
he
would
burn
our
convent
to
the
ground
were
we
to
take
her
by
moreover
souls
will
not
be
saved
by
brute
force
said
clement
while
they
were
talking
jerome
came
up
and
clement
persuaded
him
to
lie
at
the
convent
that
night
but
when
in
the
morning
clement
told
him
he
had
had
a
long
talk
with
the
abbess
and
that
she
was
very
sad
and
he
had
promised
her
to
try
and
win
back
her
nun
jerome
objected
and
said
it
was
not
their
business
and
was
a
waste
of
time
clement
however
was
no
longer
a
mere
pupil
he
stood
firm
and
at
last
they
agreed
that
jerome
should
go
forward
and
secure
their
passage
in
the
next
ship
for
england
and
clement
be
allowed
time
to
make
his
but
idle
experiment
about
ten
that
day
a
figure
in
a
horseman
cloak
and
great
boots
to
match
and
a
large
flapping
felt
hat
stood
like
a
statue
near
the
auberge
where
was
the
apostate
nun
mary
the
friar
thus
disguised
was
at
that
moment
truly
wretched
these
ardent
natures
undertake
wonders
but
are
dashed
when
they
come
hand
to
hand
with
the
sickening
difficulties
but
then
as
their
hearts
are
steel
though
their
nerves
are
anything
but
iron
they
turn
not
back
but
panting
and
dispirited
struggle
on
to
the
last
clement
hesitated
long
at
the
door
prayed
for
help
and
wisdom
and
at
last
entered
the
inn
and
sat
down
faint
at
heart
and
with
his
body
in
a
cold
perspiration
but
inside
he
was
another
man
he
called
lustily
for
a
cup
of
wine
it
was
brought
him
by
the
landlord
he
paid
for
it
with
money
the
convent
had
supplied
him
and
made
a
show
of
drinking
it
landlord
said
he
i
hear
there
is
a
fair
chambermaid
in
thine
ay
stranger
the
buxomest
in
holland
but
she
gives
not
her
company
to
all
comers
only
to
good
friar
clement
dangled
a
massive
gold
chain
in
the
landlord
sight
he
laughed
and
shouted
here
janet
here
is
a
lover
for
thee
would
bind
thee
in
chains
of
gold
and
a
tall
lad
into
the
bargain
i
promise
then
i
am
in
double
luck
said
a
female
voice
send
him
clement
rose
shuddered
and
passed
into
the
room
where
janet
was
seated
playing
with
a
piece
of
work
and
laying
it
down
every
minute
to
sing
a
mutilated
fragment
of
a
song
for
in
her
mode
of
life
she
had
not
the
patience
to
carry
anything
out
after
a
few
words
of
greeting
the
disguised
visitor
asked
her
if
they
could
not
be
more
private
somewhere
why
not
said
she
and
she
rose
and
smiled
and
went
tripping
before
him
he
followed
groaning
inwardly
and
sore
perplexed
there
said
she
have
no
fear
nobody
ever
comes
here
but
such
as
pay
for
the
clement
looked
round
the
room
and
prayed
silently
for
wisdom
then
he
went
softly
and
closed
the
carefully
what
on
earth
is
that
for
said
janet
in
some
uneasiness
sweetheart
whispered
the
visitor
with
a
mysterious
air
it
is
that
god
may
not
see
us
madman
said
janet
think
you
a
wooden
shutter
can
keep
out
his
eye
nay
i
know
not
perchance
he
has
too
much
on
hand
to
notice
us
but
i
would
not
the
saints
and
angels
should
see
us
would
you
my
poor
soul
hope
not
to
escape
their
sight
the
only
way
is
not
to
think
of
them
for
if
you
do
it
poisons
your
cup
for
two
pins
i
run
and
leave
thee
art
pleasant
company
in
after
all
girl
so
that
men
see
us
not
what
signify
god
and
the
saints
seeing
us
feel
this
chain
is
virgin
gold
i
shall
cut
two
of
these
heavy
links
off
for
ah
now
thy
discourse
is
to
the
point
and
she
handled
the
chain
greedily
why
is
as
massy
as
the
chain
round
the
virgin
neck
at
the
conv
she
did
not
finish
the
word
whisht
whisht
whisht
is
it
and
thou
shalt
have
thy
share
but
betray
me
monster
cried
janet
drawing
back
from
him
with
repugnance
what
rob
the
blessed
virgin
of
her
chain
and
give
it
to
an
you
are
none
cried
clement
exultingly
or
you
had
not
recked
for
ah
ah
ah
thy
patron
saint
whose
chain
this
is
sends
me
to
greet
thee
she
ran
screaming
to
the
window
and
began
to
undo
the
shutters
her
fingers
trembled
and
clement
had
time
to
debarass
himself
of
his
boots
and
his
hat
before
the
light
streamed
in
upon
him
he
then
let
his
cloak
quietly
fall
and
stood
before
her
a
dominican
friar
calm
and
majestic
as
a
statue
and
held
his
crucifix
towering
over
her
with
a
loving
sad
and
solemn
look
that
somehow
relieved
her
of
the
physical
part
of
fear
but
crushed
her
with
religious
terror
and
remorse
she
crouched
and
cowered
against
the
wall
mary
said
he
gently
one
word
are
you
happy
as
happy
as
i
shall
be
in
and
they
are
not
happy
at
the
convent
they
weep
for
for
me
day
and
night
above
all
the
sister
poor
ursula
and
the
strayed
nun
began
to
weep
herself
at
the
thought
of
her
friend
the
angels
weep
still
more
wilt
not
dry
all
their
tears
in
earth
and
heaven
and
save
thyself
ay
would
i
could
but
it
is
too
satan
avaunt
cried
the
monk
sternly
is
thy
favourite
temptation
and
thou
mary
listen
not
to
the
enemy
of
man
belying
god
and
whispering
despair
i
who
come
to
save
thee
have
been
a
far
greater
sinner
than
thou
come
mary
sin
thou
seest
is
not
so
sweet
in
this
world
as
holiness
and
eternity
is
at
the
how
can
they
ever
receive
me
again
is
their
worthiness
thou
doubtest
now
but
in
truth
they
pine
for
thee
was
in
pity
of
their
tears
that
i
a
dominican
undertook
this
task
and
broke
the
rule
of
my
order
by
entering
an
inn
and
broke
it
again
by
donning
these
lay
vestments
but
all
is
well
done
and
quit
for
a
light
penance
if
thou
wilt
let
us
rescue
thy
soul
from
this
den
of
wolves
and
bring
thee
back
to
thy
the
nun
gazed
at
him
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
thou
a
dominican
hast
done
this
for
a
daughter
of
francis
why
the
franciscans
and
dominicans
hate
one
ay
my
daughter
but
francis
and
dominic
love
one
the
recreant
nun
seemed
struck
and
affected
by
this
answer
clement
now
reminded
her
how
shocked
she
had
been
that
the
virgin
should
be
robbed
of
her
chain
but
see
now
said
he
the
convent
and
the
virgin
too
think
ten
times
more
of
their
poor
nun
than
of
golden
chains
for
they
freely
trusted
their
chain
to
me
a
stranger
that
peradventure
the
sight
of
it
might
touch
their
lost
mary
and
remind
her
of
their
love
finally
he
showed
her
with
such
terrible
simplicity
the
end
of
her
present
course
and
on
the
other
hand
so
revived
her
dormant
memories
and
better
feelings
that
she
kneeled
sobbing
at
his
feet
and
owned
she
had
never
known
happiness
nor
peace
since
she
betrayed
her
vows
and
said
she
would
go
back
if
he
would
go
with
her
but
alone
she
dared
not
could
not
even
if
she
reached
the
gate
she
could
never
enter
how
could
she
face
the
abbess
and
the
sisters
he
told
her
he
would
go
with
her
as
joyfully
as
the
shepherd
bears
a
strayed
lamb
to
the
fold
but
when
he
urged
her
to
go
at
once
up
sprung
a
crop
of
those
prodigiously
petty
difficulties
that
entangle
her
sex
like
silken
nets
liker
iron
cobwebs
he
quietly
swept
them
aside
but
how
can
i
walk
beside
thee
in
this
habit
i
have
brought
the
gown
and
cowl
of
thy
holy
order
hide
thy
bravery
with
them
and
leave
thy
shoes
as
i
leave
these
pointing
to
his
horseman
boots
she
collected
her
jewels
and
ornaments
what
are
these
for
inquired
clement
to
present
to
the
convent
their
source
is
too
but
objected
the
penitent
it
would
be
a
sin
to
leave
them
here
they
can
be
sold
to
feed
the
mary
fix
thine
eye
on
this
crucifix
and
trample
those
devilish
baubles
beneath
thy
she
hesitated
but
soon
threw
them
down
and
trampled
on
them
now
open
the
window
and
fling
them
out
on
that
dunghill
is
well
done
so
pass
the
wages
of
sin
from
thy
hands
its
glittering
yoke
from
thy
neck
its
pollution
from
thy
soul
away
daughter
of
francis
we
tarry
in
this
vile
place
too
she
followed
him
but
they
were
not
clear
yet
at
first
the
landlord
was
so
astounded
at
seeing
a
black
friar
and
a
grey
nun
pass
through
his
kitchen
from
the
inside
that
he
gaped
and
muttered
why
what
mummery
is
this
but
he
soon
comprehended
the
matter
and
whipped
in
between
the
fugitives
and
the
door
what
ho
reuben
carl
gavin
here
is
a
false
friar
spiriting
away
our
the
men
came
running
in
with
threatening
looks
the
friar
rushed
at
them
crucifix
in
hand
forbear
he
cried
in
a
stentorian
voice
she
is
a
holy
nun
returning
to
her
vows
the
hand
that
touches
her
cowl
or
her
robe
to
stay
her
it
shall
wither
his
body
shall
lie
unburied
cursed
by
rome
and
his
soul
shall
roast
in
eternal
they
shrank
back
as
if
a
flame
had
met
them
and
thou
miserable
panderer
he
did
not
end
the
sentence
in
words
but
seized
the
man
by
the
neck
and
strong
as
a
lion
in
his
moments
of
hot
excitement
hurled
him
furiously
from
the
door
and
sent
him
all
across
the
room
pitching
head
foremost
on
to
the
stone
floor
then
tore
the
door
open
and
carried
the
screaming
nun
out
into
the
road
hush
poor
trembler
he
gasped
they
dare
not
molest
thee
on
the
highroad
away
the
landlord
lay
terrified
half
stunned
and
bleeding
and
mary
though
she
often
looked
back
apprehensively
saw
no
more
of
him
on
the
road
he
bade
her
observe
his
impetuosity
hitherto
said
he
we
have
spoken
of
thy
faults
now
for
mine
my
choler
is
ungovernable
furious
it
is
by
the
grace
of
god
i
am
not
a
murderer
i
repent
the
next
moment
but
a
moment
too
late
is
all
too
late
mary
had
the
churls
laid
finger
on
thee
i
should
have
scattered
their
brains
with
my
crucifix
oh
i
know
myself
go
to
and
tremble
at
myself
there
lurketh
a
wild
beast
beneath
this
black
gown
of
alas
father
said
mary
were
you
other
than
you
are
i
had
been
lost
to
take
me
from
that
place
needed
a
man
wary
as
a
fox
yet
bold
as
a
clement
reflected
this
much
is
certain
god
chooseth
well
his
fleshly
instruments
and
with
imperfect
hearts
doeth
his
perfect
work
glory
be
to
god
when
they
were
near
the
convent
mary
suddenly
stopped
and
seized
the
friar
arm
and
began
to
cry
he
looked
at
her
kindly
and
told
her
she
had
nothing
to
fear
it
would
be
the
happiest
day
she
had
ever
spent
he
then
made
her
sit
down
and
compose
herself
till
he
should
return
he
entered
the
convent
and
desired
to
see
the
abbess
my
sister
give
the
glory
to
god
mary
is
at
the
the
astonishment
and
delight
of
the
abbess
were
unbounded
she
yielded
at
once
to
clement
earnest
request
that
the
road
of
penitence
might
be
smoothed
at
first
to
this
unstable
wanderer
and
after
some
opposition
she
entered
heartily
into
his
views
as
to
her
actual
reception
to
give
time
for
their
little
preparations
clement
went
slowly
back
and
seating
himself
by
mary
soothed
her
and
heard
her
confession
the
abbess
has
granted
me
that
you
shall
propose
your
own
it
shall
be
none
the
lighter
said
she
i
trow
not
said
he
but
that
is
future
is
given
to
joy
he
then
led
her
round
the
building
to
the
abbess
postern
as
they
went
they
heard
musical
instruments
and
singing
is
a
feastday
said
mary
and
i
come
to
mar
hardly
said
clement
smiling
seeing
that
you
are
the
queen
of
the
i
father
what
mean
you
what
mary
have
you
never
heard
that
there
is
more
joy
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
than
over
just
persons
which
need
no
repentance
now
this
convent
is
not
heaven
nor
the
nuns
angels
yet
are
there
among
then
some
angelic
spirits
and
these
sing
and
exult
at
thy
return
but
here
methinks
comes
one
of
them
for
i
see
her
hand
trembles
at
the
the
postern
was
flung
open
and
in
a
moment
sister
ursula
clung
sobbing
and
kissing
round
her
friend
neck
the
abbess
followed
more
sedately
but
little
less
moved
clement
bade
them
farewell
they
entreated
him
to
stay
but
he
told
them
with
much
regret
he
could
not
he
had
already
tried
his
good
brother
jerome
patience
and
must
hasten
to
the
river
and
perhaps
sail
for
england
so
mary
returned
to
the
fold
and
clement
strode
briskly
on
towards
the
rhine
and
england
this
was
the
man
for
whom
margaret
boy
lay
in
wait
with
her
letter
the
hearth
and
that
letter
was
one
of
those
simple
touching
appeals
only
her
sex
can
write
to
those
who
have
used
them
cruelly
and
they
love
them
she
began
by
telling
him
of
the
birth
of
the
little
boy
and
the
comfort
he
had
been
to
her
in
all
the
distress
of
mind
his
long
and
strange
silence
had
caused
her
she
described
the
little
gerard
minutely
not
forgetting
the
mole
on
his
little
finger
know
you
any
one
that
hath
the
like
on
his
if
you
only
saw
him
you
could
not
choose
but
be
proud
of
him
all
the
mothers
in
the
street
do
envy
me
but
i
the
wives
for
thou
comest
not
to
us
my
own
gerard
some
say
thou
art
dead
but
if
thou
wert
dead
how
could
i
be
alive
others
say
that
thou
whom
i
love
so
truly
art
false
but
this
will
i
believe
from
no
lips
but
thine
my
father
loved
thee
well
and
as
he
lay
he
thought
he
saw
thee
on
a
great
river
with
thy
face
turned
towards
thy
margaret
but
sore
disfigured
so
perchance
have
cruel
men
scarred
thy
sweet
face
or
hast
thou
lost
one
of
thy
precious
limbs
why
then
thou
hast
the
more
need
of
me
and
i
shall
love
thee
not
worse
alas
thinkest
thou
a
woman
love
is
light
as
a
man
but
better
than
i
did
when
i
shed
those
few
drops
from
my
arm
not
worth
the
tears
thou
didst
shed
for
them
mindest
thou
is
not
so
very
long
agone
dear
the
letter
continued
in
this
strain
and
concluded
without
a
word
of
reproach
or
doubt
as
to
his
faith
and
affection
not
that
she
was
free
from
most
distressing
doubts
but
they
were
not
certainties
and
to
show
them
might
turn
the
scale
and
frighten
him
away
from
her
with
fear
of
being
scolded
and
of
this
letter
she
made
soft
luke
the
bearer
so
she
was
not
an
angel
after
all
luke
mingled
with
the
passengers
of
two
boats
and
could
hear
nothing
of
gerard
eliassoen
nor
did
this
surprise
him
he
was
more
surprised
when
at
the
third
attempt
a
black
friar
said
to
him
somewhat
severely
and
what
would
you
with
him
you
call
gerard
eliassoen
why
father
if
he
is
alive
i
have
got
a
letter
for
humph
said
jerome
i
am
sorry
for
it
however
the
flesh
is
weak
well
my
son
he
you
seek
will
be
here
by
the
next
boat
or
the
next
boat
after
and
if
he
chooses
to
answer
to
that
name
after
all
i
am
not
the
keeper
of
his
good
father
one
plain
word
for
heaven
sake
this
gerard
eliassoen
of
tergou
is
he
alive
humph
why
certes
he
that
went
by
that
name
is
well
then
that
is
settled
said
luke
drily
but
the
next
moment
he
found
it
necessary
to
run
out
of
sight
and
blubber
oh
why
did
the
lord
make
any
women
said
he
to
himself
i
was
content
with
the
world
till
i
fell
in
love
here
his
little
finger
is
more
to
her
than
my
whole
body
and
he
is
not
dead
and
here
i
have
got
to
give
him
he
looked
at
the
letter
and
dashed
it
on
the
ground
but
he
picked
it
up
again
with
a
spiteful
snatch
and
went
to
the
landlord
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
begged
for
work
the
landlord
declined
said
he
had
his
own
people
oh
i
seek
not
your
money
said
luke
i
only
want
some
work
to
keep
me
from
breaking
my
heart
about
another
man
good
lad
good
lad
exploded
the
landlord
and
found
him
lots
of
barrels
to
mend
on
these
terms
and
he
coopered
with
fury
in
the
interval
of
the
boats
coming
down
the
rhine
chapter
lxxxiii
the
hearth
waiting
an
earnest
letter
seldom
leaves
the
mind
in
statu
quo
margaret
in
hers
vented
her
energy
and
her
faith
in
her
dying
vision
or
illusion
and
when
this
was
done
and
luke
gone
she
wondered
at
her
credulity
and
her
conscience
pricked
her
about
luke
and
catherine
came
and
scolded
her
and
she
paid
the
price
of
false
hopes
and
elevation
of
spirits
by
falling
into
deeper
despondency
she
was
found
in
this
state
by
a
staunch
friend
she
had
lately
made
joan
ketel
this
good
woman
came
in
radiant
with
an
idea
margaret
i
know
the
cure
for
thine
ill
the
hermit
of
gouda
a
wondrous
holy
man
why
he
can
tell
what
is
coming
when
he
is
in
the
ay
i
have
heard
of
him
said
margaret
hopelessly
joan
with
some
difficulty
persuaded
her
to
walk
out
as
far
as
gouda
and
consult
the
hermit
they
took
some
butter
and
eggs
in
a
basket
and
went
to
his
cave
what
had
made
the
pair
such
fast
friends
jorian
some
six
weeks
ago
fell
ill
of
a
bowel
disease
it
began
with
raging
pain
and
when
this
went
off
leaving
him
weak
an
awkward
symptom
succeeded
nothing
either
liquid
or
solid
would
stay
in
his
stomach
a
minute
the
doctor
said
he
must
die
if
this
goes
on
many
hours
therefore
boil
thou
now
a
chicken
with
a
golden
angel
in
the
water
and
let
him
sup
that
alas
gilt
chicken
broth
shared
the
fate
of
the
humbler
viands
its
predecessors
then
the
cure
steeped
the
thumb
of
sergius
in
beef
broth
same
result
then
joan
ran
weeping
to
margaret
to
borrow
some
linen
to
make
his
shroud
let
me
see
him
said
margaret
she
came
in
and
felt
his
pulse
ah
said
she
i
doubt
they
have
not
gone
to
the
root
open
the
window
art
stifling
him
now
change
all
his
linen
alack
woman
what
for
why
foul
more
linen
for
a
dying
man
objected
the
mediaeval
wife
do
as
thou
art
bid
said
margaret
dully
and
left
the
room
joan
somehow
found
herself
doing
as
she
was
bid
margaret
returned
with
her
apron
full
of
a
flowering
herb
she
made
a
decoction
and
took
it
to
the
bedside
and
before
giving
it
to
the
patient
took
a
spoonful
herself
and
smacked
her
lips
hypocritically
that
is
fair
said
he
with
a
feeble
attempt
at
humour
why
is
sweet
and
now
is
she
engaged
him
in
conversation
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
it
this
stayed
by
him
seeing
which
she
built
on
it
as
cards
are
built
mixed
a
very
little
schiedam
in
the
third
spoonful
and
a
little
beaten
yoke
of
egg
in
the
seventh
and
so
with
the
patience
of
her
sex
she
coaxed
his
body
out
of
death
grasp
and
finally
nature
being
patted
on
the
back
instead
of
kicked
under
the
bed
set
jorian
ketel
on
his
legs
again
but
the
doctress
made
them
both
swear
never
to
tell
a
soul
her
guilty
deed
they
would
put
me
in
prison
away
from
my
the
simple
that
saved
jorian
was
called
sweet
feverfew
she
gathered
it
in
his
own
garden
her
eagle
eye
had
seen
it
growing
out
of
the
window
margaret
and
joan
then
reached
the
hermit
cave
and
placed
their
present
on
the
little
platform
margaret
then
applied
her
mouth
to
the
aperture
made
for
that
purpose
and
said
holy
hermit
we
bring
thee
butter
and
eggs
of
the
best
and
i
a
poor
deserted
girl
wife
yet
no
wife
and
mother
of
the
sweetest
babe
come
to
pray
thee
tell
me
whether
he
is
quick
or
dead
true
to
his
vows
or
a
faint
voice
issued
from
the
cave
trouble
me
not
with
the
things
of
earth
but
send
me
a
holy
friar
i
am
alas
cried
margaret
is
it
so
poor
soul
then
let
us
in
to
help
saints
forbid
thine
is
a
woman
voice
send
me
a
holy
they
went
back
as
they
came
joan
could
not
help
saying
are
women
imps
o
darkness
then
that
they
must
not
come
anigh
a
dying
bed
but
margaret
was
too
deeply
dejected
to
say
anything
joan
applied
rough
consolation
but
she
was
not
listened
to
till
she
said
and
jorian
will
speak
out
ere
long
he
is
just
on
the
boil
he
is
very
grateful
to
thee
believe
seeing
is
believing
replied
margaret
with
quiet
bitterness
not
but
what
he
thinks
you
might
have
saved
him
with
something
more
out
o
the
common
than
yon
man
of
my
inches
to
be
cured
wi
feverfew
says
he
if
there
is
a
sorry
herb
says
he
i
was
thinking
o
pulling
all
mine
up
says
he
i
up
and
told
him
remedies
were
none
the
better
for
being
you
and
feverfew
cured
him
when
the
grand
medicines
came
up
faster
than
they
went
down
so
says
i
may
go
down
on
your
four
bones
to
feverfew
but
indeed
he
is
grateful
at
bottom
you
are
all
his
thought
and
all
his
chat
but
he
sees
folk
coming
around
ye
and
good
friends
and
he
said
only
last
night
well
he
made
me
vow
not
to
tell
prithee
tell
well
he
said
if
i
tell
what
little
i
know
it
wo
bring
him
back
and
it
will
set
them
all
by
the
ears
i
wish
i
had
more
headpiece
said
he
am
sore
perplexed
but
least
said
is
soonest
mended
yon
is
his
favourite
word
he
comes
back
from
a
mile
margaret
shook
her
head
ay
we
are
wading
in
deep
waters
my
poor
babe
and
it
was
saturday
night
and
no
luke
poor
luke
said
margaret
it
was
very
good
of
him
to
go
on
such
an
he
is
one
out
of
a
hundred
replied
catherine
warmly
mother
do
you
think
he
would
be
kind
to
little
gerard
i
am
sure
he
would
so
do
you
be
kinder
to
him
when
he
comes
back
will
ye
now
the
cloister
brother
clement
directed
by
the
nuns
avoided
a
bend
in
the
river
and
striding
lustily
forward
reached
a
station
some
miles
nearer
the
coast
than
that
where
luke
lay
in
wait
for
gerard
eliassoen
and
the
next
morning
he
started
early
and
was
in
rotterdam
at
noon
he
made
at
once
for
the
port
not
to
keep
jerome
waiting
he
observed
several
monks
of
his
order
on
the
quay
he
went
to
them
but
jerome
was
not
amongst
them
he
asked
one
of
them
whether
jerome
had
arrived
surely
brother
was
the
reply
prithee
where
is
he
where
why
there
said
the
monk
pointing
to
a
ship
in
full
sail
and
clement
now
noticed
that
all
the
monks
were
looking
seaward
what
gone
without
me
oh
jerome
jerome
cried
he
in
a
voice
of
anguish
several
of
the
friars
turned
round
and
stared
you
must
be
brother
clement
said
one
of
them
at
length
and
on
this
they
kissed
him
and
greeted
him
with
brotherly
warmth
and
gave
him
a
letter
jerome
had
charged
them
with
for
him
it
was
a
hasty
scrawl
the
writer
told
him
coldly
a
ship
was
about
to
sail
for
england
and
he
was
loth
to
lose
time
he
clement
might
follow
if
he
pleased
but
he
would
do
much
better
to
stay
behind
and
preach
to
his
own
country
folk
give
the
glory
to
god
brother
you
have
a
wonderful
power
over
dutch
hearts
but
you
are
no
match
for
those
haughty
islanders
you
are
too
tender
know
thou
that
on
the
way
i
met
one
who
asked
me
for
thee
under
the
name
thou
didst
bear
in
the
world
be
on
thy
guard
let
not
the
world
catch
thee
again
by
any
silken
net
and
remember
solitude
fasting
and
prayer
are
the
sword
spear
and
shield
of
the
soul
clement
was
deeply
shocked
and
mortified
at
this
contemptuous
desertion
and
this
missive
he
promised
the
good
monks
to
sleep
at
the
convent
and
to
preach
wherever
the
prior
should
appoint
for
jerome
had
raised
him
to
the
skies
as
a
preacher
and
then
withdrew
abruptly
for
he
was
cut
to
the
quick
and
wanted
to
be
alone
he
asked
himself
was
there
some
incurable
fault
in
him
repulsive
to
so
true
a
son
of
dominic
or
was
jerome
himself
devoid
of
that
christian
love
which
paul
had
placed
above
faith
itself
shipwrecked
with
him
and
saved
on
the
same
fragment
of
the
wreck
his
pupil
his
penitent
his
son
in
the
church
and
now
for
four
hundred
miles
his
in
christ
and
to
be
shaken
off
like
dirt
the
first
opportunity
with
harsh
and
cold
disdain
why
worldly
hearts
are
no
colder
nor
less
trusty
than
this
said
he
the
only
one
that
ever
really
loved
me
lies
in
a
grave
hard
by
fly
me
fly
to
england
man
born
without
a
heart
i
will
go
and
pray
over
a
grave
at
three
hours
later
he
passed
peter
cottage
a
troop
of
noisy
children
were
playing
about
the
door
and
the
house
had
been
repaired
and
a
new
outhouse
added
he
turned
his
head
hastily
away
not
to
disturb
a
picture
his
memory
treasured
and
went
to
the
churchyard
he
sought
among
the
tombstones
for
margaret
he
could
not
find
it
he
could
not
believe
they
had
grudged
her
a
tombstone
so
searched
the
churchyard
all
over
again
oh
poverty
stern
poverty
poor
soul
thou
wert
like
me
no
one
was
left
that
loved
thee
when
gerard
was
he
went
into
the
church
and
after
kissing
the
steps
prayed
long
and
earnestly
for
the
soul
of
her
whose
he
could
not
find
coming
out
of
the
church
he
saw
a
very
old
man
looking
over
the
little
churchyard
gate
he
went
towards
him
and
asked
him

live
in
the
place

score
and
twelve
years

convent
at
sunset
and
watched
and
prayed
in

chapel
for
jerome

till
it
was
long
past
midnight
and
his
soul
had
recovered
its
cold
calm

the
hearth
the
next
day
sunday
after
mass
was
a
bustling
day
at
house
in
the
hoog
straet
the
shop
was
now
quite
ready
and
cornelis
and
sybrandt
were
to
open
it
next
day
their
names
were
above
the
door
also
their
sign
a
white
lamb
sucking
a
gilt
sheep
eli
had
come
and
brought
them
some
more
goods
from
his
store
to
give
them
a
good
start
the
hearts
of
the
parents
glowed
at
what
they
were
doing
and
the
pair
themselves
walked
in
the
garden
together
and
agreed
they
were
sick
of
their
old
life
and
it
was
more
pleasant
to
make
money
than
waste
it
they
vowed
to
stick
to
business
like
wax
their
mother
quick
and
ever
watchful
ear
overheard
this
resolution
through
an
open
window
and
she
told
eli
the
family
supper
was
to
include
margaret
and
her
boy
and
be
a
kind
of
inaugural
feast
at
which
good
trade
advice
was
to
flow
from
the
elders
and
good
wine
to
be
drunk
to
the
success
of
the
converts
to
commerce
from
agriculture
in
its
unremunerative
form
wild
oats
so
margaret
had
come
over
to
help
her
and
also
to
shake
off
her
own
deep
languor
and
both
their
faces
were
as
red
as
the
fire
presently
in
came
joan
with
a
salad
from
jorian
garden
he
cut
it
for
you
margaret
you
are
all
his
chat
i
shall
be
jealous
i
told
him
you
were
to
feast
but
oh
lass
what
a
sermon
in
the
new
kerk
preaching
i
never
heard
it
till

this
afternoon
but
mayhap

she
said
catherine
come

margaret
methinks
i
should
not
be
such
a
damper
at
table
if

could
come
to
warm
from
a
good
then
you
must
be
brisk
observed
joan
see
the
folk
are
wending
that
way
and
as
i
live
there
goes
the
holy
friar
oh
bless
us
and
save
us
margaret
the
hermit
we
and
this
active
woman
bounded
out
of
the
house
and
ran
across
the
road
and
stopped
the
friar
she
returned
as
quickly
there
i
was
bent
on
seeing
him
nigh
what
said
he
to
thee
says
he
daughter
i
will
go
to
him
ere
sunset
god
willing
the
sweetest
voice
but
oh
my
mistresses
what
thin
cheeks
for
a
young
man
and
great
eyes
not
far
from
your
colour
i
have
a
great
mind
to
go

said
margaret
but
my
cap

not
very
clean
and
they
will
all
be
there
in
their
there

my
handkerchief
out
of

catherine
you

my
poor
kate
it

one
of
her
ill
margaret
replied
by
taking
the
boy
upstairs
she
found
kate
in
bed
how

sore
pain

smilest
so

brought

thou
two
by
my
way
of
counting
said
kate
with
an
angelic
smile
she
had
a
spasm
at
that
moment
would
have
made
some
of
us
roar
like
bulls
what
in
your
lap
said
margaret
answering
a
gesture
of
the
suffering
girl
nay
he
is
too
heavy
and
thou
in
such
i
love
him
too
dear
to
feel
his
weight
was
the
reply
margaret
took
this
opportunity
and
made
her
toilet
i
am
for
the
kerk
said
she
to
hear
a
beautiful
kate
sighed
and
a
minute
ago
kate
i
was
all
agog
to
go
that
is
the
way
with
me
this
month
past
up

word

said
kate
prithee
go
and
bring
me
back
every
word
that
i
can
not
go
and
the
tears
stood
in
the
patient
eyes
this
decided
margaret
and
she
kissed
kate
looked
under
her
lashes
at
the
boy
and
heaved
a
little
sigh
i
trow
i
must
not
said
she
i
never
could
kiss
him
a
little
and
my
father
was
dead
against
waking

child

day
or
night
when

thy
pleasure
to
wake

thy
aunt
kate
the
two
new
words

and
she
went
out
looking
lovingly
over
her
shoulder
and
shut
the
door
inaudibly
joan

will
lend
me
a
hand

catherine

silent

good
way

street

homely
housewives

an
incident
catherine

on
the
launch

to

there
an
end
what
one
grandchild
chapter
lxxxv
the
cloister
and
the
hearth
the
sermon
had
begun
when
margaret
entered
the
great
church
of
laurens
it
was
a
huge
edifice
far
from
completed
churches
were
not
built
in
a
year
the
side
aisles
were
roofed
but
not
the
mid
aisle
nor
the
chancel
the
pillars
and
arches
were
pretty
perfect
and
some
of
them
whitewashed
but
only
one
window
in
the
whole
church
was
glazed
the
rest
were
at
present
great
jagged
openings
in
the
outer
walls
but
all
these
uncouth
imperfections
made
the
church
beautiful
it
was
a
glorious
summer
afternoon
and
the
sunshine
came
broken
into
marvellous
forms
through
those
irregular
openings
and
played
bewitching
pranks
upon
so
many
broken
surfaces
it
streamed
through
the
gaping
walls
and
clove
the
dark
cool
side
aisles
with
rivers
of
glory
and
dazzled
and
glowed
on
the
white
pillars
beyond
and
nearly
the
whole
central
aisle
was
chequered
with
light
and
shade
in
broken
outlines
the
shades
seeming
cooler
and
more
soothing
than
ever
shade
was
and
the
lights
like
patches
of
amber
diamond
animated
with
heavenly
fire
and
above
from
west
to
east
the
blue
sky
vaulted
the
lofty
aisle
and
seemed
quite
close
the
sunny
caps
of
the
women
made
a
sea
of
white
contrasting
exquisitely
with
that
vivid
vault
of
blue
for
the
mid
aisle
huge
as
it
was
was
crammed
yet
quite
still
the
words
and
the
mellow
gentle
earnest
voice
of
the
preacher
held
them
mute
margaret
stood
spellbound
at
the
beauty
the
devotion
the
great
calm
she
got
behind
a
pillar
in
the
north
aisle
and
there
though
she
could
hardly
catch
a
word
a
sweet
devotional
langour
crept
over
her
at
the
loveliness
of
the
place
and
the
preacher
musical
voice
and
balmy
oil
seemed
to
trickle
over
the
waves
in
her
heart
and
smooth
them
so
she
leaned
against
the
pillar
with
eyes
half
closed
and
all
seemed
soft
and
dreamy
she
felt
it
good
to
be
there
presently
she
saw
a
lady
leave
an
excellent
place
opposite
to
get
out
of
the
sun
which
was
indeed
pouring
on
her
head
from
the
window
margaret
went
round
softly
but
swiftly
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
the
place
she
was
now
beside
a
pillar
of
the
south
aisle
and
not
above
fifty
feet
from
the
preacher
she
was
at
his
side
a
little
behind
him
but
could
hear
every
word
her
attention
however
was
soon
distracted
by
the
shadow
of
a
head
and
shoulders
bobbing
up
and
down
so
drolly
she
had
some
ado
to
keep
from
smiling
yet
it
was
nothing
essentially
droll
it
was
the
sexton
digging
she
found
that
out
in
a
moment
by
looking
behind
her
through
the
window
to
whence
the
shadow
came
now
as
she
was
looking
at
jorian
ketel
digging
suddenly
a
tone
of
the
preacher
voice
fell
upon
her
ear
and
her
mind
so
distinctly
it
seemed
literally
to
strike
her
and
make
her
vibrate
inside
and
out
her
hand
went
to
her
bosom
so
strange
and
sudden
was
the
thrill
then
she
turned
round
and
looked
at
the
preacher
his
back
was
turned
and
nothing
visible
but
his
tonsure
she
sighed
that
tonsure
being
all
she
saw
contradicted
the
tone
effectually
yet
she
now
leaned
a
little
forward
with
downcast
eyes
hoping
for
that
accent
again
it
did
not
come
but
the
whole
voice
grew
strangely
upon
her
it
rose
and
fell
as
the
preacher
warmed
and
it
seemed
to
waken
faint
echoes
of
a
thousand
happy
memories
she
would
not
look
to
dispel
the
melancholy
pleasure
this
voice
gave
her
presently
in
the
middle
of
an
eloquent
period
the
preacher
stopped
she
almost
sighed
a
soothing
music
had
ended
could
the
sermon
be
ended
already
no
she
looked
round
the
people
did
not
move
a
good
many
faces
seemed
now
to
turn
her
way
she
looked
behind
her
sharply
there
was
nothing
there
startled
countenances
near
her
now
eyed
the
preacher
she
followed
their
looks
and
there
in
the
pulpit
was
a
face
as
of
a
staring
corpse
the
friar
eyes
naturally
large
and
made
larger
by
the
thinness
of
his
cheeks
were
dilated
to
supernatural
size
and
glaring
her
way
out
of
a
bloodless
face
she
cringed
and
turned
fearfully
round
for
she
thought
there
must
be
some
terrible
thing
near
her
no
there
was
nothing
she
was
the
outside
figure
of
the
listening
crowd
at
this
moment
the
church
fell
into
commotion
figures
got
up
all
over
the
building
and
craned
forward
agitated
faces
by
hundreds
gazed
from
the
friar
to
margaret
and
from
margaret
to
the
friar
the
turning
to
and
fro
of
so
many
caps
made
a
loud
rustle
then
came
shrieks
of
nervous
women
and
buzzing
of
men
and
margaret
seeing
so
many
eyes
levelled
at
her
shrank
terrified
behind
the
pillar
with
one
scared
hurried
glance
at
the
preacher
momentary
as
that
glance
was
it
caught
in
that
stricken
face
an
expression
that
made
her
shiver
she
turned
faint
and
sat
down
on
a
heap
of
chips
the
workmen
had
left
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
the
sermon
went
on
again
she
heard
the
sound
of
it
but
not
the
sense
she
tried
to
think
but
her
mind
was
in
a
whirl
thought
would
fix
itself
in
no
shape
but
this
that
on
that
face
she
had
seen
a
look
stamped
and
the
recollection
of
that
look
now
made
her
quiver
from
head
to
foot
for
that
look
was
the
sermon
after
wavering
some
time
ended
in
a
strain
of
exalted
nay
feverish
eloquence
that
went
far
to
make
the
crowd
forget
the
preacher
strange
pause
and
ghastly
glare
margaret
mingled
hastily
with
the
crowd
and
went
out
of
the
church
with
them
they
went
their
ways
home
but
she
turned
at
the
door
and
went
into
the
churchyard
to
peter
grave
poor
as
she
was
she
had
given
him
a
slab
and
a
headstone
she
sat
down
on
the
slab
and
kissed
it
then
threw
her
apron
over
her
head
that
no
one
might
distinguish
her
by
her
hair
father
she
said
thou
hast
often
heard
me
say
i
am
wading
in
deep
waters
but
now
i
begin
to
think
god
only
knows
the
bottom
of
them
follow
that
friar
round
the
world
but
i
see
him
at
arm
length
and
he
shall
tell
me
why
he
looked
towards
me
like
a
dead
man
wakened
and
not
a
soul
behind
me
oh
father
you
often
praised
me
here
speak
a
word
for
me
there
for
i
am
wading
in
deep
her
father
tomb
commanded
a
side
view
of
the
church
door
and
on
that
tomb
she
sat
with
her
face
covered
waylaying
the
holy
preacher
chapter
lxxxvi
the
cloister
and
the
hearth
the
cool
church
chequered
with
sunbeams
and
crowned
with
heavenly
purple
soothed
and
charmed
father
clement
as
it
did
margaret
and
more
it
carried
his
mind
direct
to
the
creator
of
all
good
and
pure
delights
then
his
eye
fell
on
the
great
aisle
crammed
with
his
country
folk
a
thousand
snowy
caps
filigreed
with
gold
many
a
hundred
leagues
he
had
travelled
but
seen
nothing
like
them
except
snow
in
the
morning
he
had
thundered
but
this
sweet
afternoon
seemed
out
of
tune
with
threats
his
bowels
yearned
over
that
multitude
and
he
must
tell
them
of
god
love
poor
souls
they
heard
almost
as
little
of
it
from
the
pulpit
then
a
days
as
the
heathen
used
he
told
them
the
glad
tidings
of
salvation
the
people
hung
upon
his
gentle
earnest
tongue
he
was
not
one
of
those
preachers
who
keep
gyrating
in
the
pulpit
like
the
weathercock
on
the
steeple
he
moved
the
hearts
of
others
more
than
his
own
body
but
on
the
other
hand
he
did
not
entirely
neglect
those
who
were
in
bad
places
and
presently
warm
with
this
theme
that
none
of
all
that
multitude
might
miss
the
joyful
tidings
of
christ
love
he
turned
him
towards
the
south
aisle
and
there
in
a
stream
of
sunshine
from
the
window
was
the
radiant
face
of
margaret
brandt
he
gazed
at
it
without
emotion
it
just
benumbed
him
soul
and
body
but
soon
the
words
died
in
his
throat
and
he
trembled
as
he
glared
at
it
there
with
her
auburn
hair
bathed
in
sunbeams
and
glittering
like
the
gloriola
of
a
saint
and
her
face
glowing
doubly
with
its
own
beauty
and
the
sunshine
it
was
set
his
dead
love
she
was
leaning
very
lightly
against
a
white
column
she
was
listening
with
tender
downcast
lashes
he
had
seen
her
listen
so
to
him
a
hundred
times
there
was
no
change
in
her
this
was
the
blooming
margaret
he
had
left
only
a
shade
riper
and
more
lovely
he
started
at
her
with
monstrous
eyes
and
bloodless
cheeks
the
people
died
out
of
his
sight
he
heard
as
in
a
dream
a
rustling
and
rising
all
over
the
church
but
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
that
face
all
life
and
bloom
and
beauty
and
that
wondrous
auburn
hair
glistening
gloriously
in
the
sun
he
gazed
thinking
she
must
vanish
she
remained
all
in
a
moment
she
was
looking
at
him
full
her
own
violet
eyes
at
this
he
was
beside
himself
and
his
lips
parted
to
shriek
out
her
name
when
she
turned
her
head
swiftly
and
soon
after
vanished
but
not
without
one
more
glance
which
though
rapid
as
lightning
encountered
his
and
left
her
couching
and
quivering
with
her
mind
in
a
whirl
and
him
panting
and
gripping
the
pulpit
convulsively
for
this
glance
of
hers
though
not
recognition
was
the
startled
inquiring
nameless
indescribable
look
that
precedes
recognition
he
made
a
mighty
effort
and
muttered
something
nobody
could
understand
then
feebly
resumed
his
discourse
and
stammered
and
babbled
on
a
while
till
by
degrees
forcing
himself
now
she
was
out
of
sight
to
look
on
it
as
a
vision
from
the
other
world
he
rose
into
a
state
of
unnatural
excitement
and
concluded
in
a
style
of
eloquence
that
electrified
the
simple
for
it
bordered
on
rhapsody
the
sermon
ended
he
sat
down
on
the
pulpit
stool
terribly
shaken
but
presently
an
idea
very
characteristic
of
the
time
took
possession
of
him
he
had
sought
her
grave
at
sevenbergen
in
vain
she
had
now
been
permitted
to
appear
to
him
and
show
him
that
she
was
buried
here
probably
hard
by
that
very
pillar
where
her
spirit
had
showed
itself
to
him
this
idea
once
adopted
soon
settled
on
his
mind
with
all
the
certainty
of
a
fact
and
he
felt
he
had
only
to
speak
to
the
sexton
whom
to
his
great
disgust
he
had
seen
working
during
the
sermon
to
learn
the
spot
where
she
was
laid
the
church
was
now
quite
empty
he
came
down
from
the
pulpit
and
stepped
through
an
aperture
in
the
south
wall
on
to
the
grass
and
went
up
to
the
sexton
he
knew
him
in
a
moment
but
jorian
never
suspected
the
poor
lad
whose
life
he
had
saved
in
this
holy
friar
the
loss
of
his
shapely
beard
had
wonderfully
altered
the
outline
of
his
face
this
had
changed
him
even
more
than
his
tonsure
his
short
hair
sprinkled
with
premature
grey
and
his
cheeks
thinned
and
paled
by
fasts
and
vigils
my
son
said
friar
clement
softly
if
you
keep
any
memory
of
those
whom
you
lay
in
the
earth
prithee
tell
me
is
any
christian
buried
inside
the
church
near
one
of
the
pillars
nay
father
said
jorian
here
in
the
churchyard
lie
buried
all
that
buried
be
why
no
matter
prithee
tell
me
then
where
lieth
margaret
margaret
brandt
and
jorian
stared
stupidly
at
the
speaker
she
died
about
three
years
ago
and
was
buried
oh
that
is
another
matter
said
jorian
that
was
before
my
time
the
vicar
could
tell
you
likely
if
so
be
she
was
a
gentlewoman
or
at
the
least
rich
enough
to
pay
him
his
alas
my
son
she
was
poor
and
paid
a
heavy
penalty
for
it
but
born
of
decent
folk
her
father
peter
was
a
learned
physician
she
came
hither
from
sevenbergen
to
when
clement
had
uttered
these
words
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
and
he
seemed
to
have
no
power
nor
wish
to
question
jorian
more
i
doubt
even
if
he
knew
where
he
was
he
was
lost
in
the
past
jorian
put
down
his
spade
and
standing
upright
in
the
grave
set
his
arms
akimbo
and
said
sulkily
are
you
making
a
fool
of
me
holy
sir
or
has
some
wag
been
making
a
fool
of
you
and
having
relieved
his
mind
thus
he
proceeded
to
dig
again
with
a
certain
vigour
that
showed
his
somewhat
irritable
temper
was
ruffled
clement
gazed
at
him
with
a
puzzled
but
gently
reproachful
eye
for
the
tone
was
rude
and
the
words
unintelligible
though
crusty
jorian
had
not
thrown
up
three
spadefuls
ere
he
became
ashamed
of
it
himself
why
what
a
base
churl
am
i
to
speak
thus
to
thee
holy
father
and
thou
a
standing
there
looking
at
me
like
a
lamb
aha
i
have
it
is
peter
brandt
grave
you
would
fain
see
not
margaret
he
does
lie
here
hard
by
the
west
door
there
i
show
and
he
laid
down
his
spade
and
put
on
his
doublet
and
jerkin
to
go
with
the
friar
he
did
not
know
there
was
anybody
sitting
on
peter
tomb
still
less
that
she
was
watching
for
this
holy
friar
pietro
vanucci
and
andrea
did
not
recognize
him
without
his
beard
the
fact
is
that
the
beard
which
has
never
known
a
razor
grows
in
a
very
picturesque
and
characteristic
form
and
becomes
a
feature
in
the
face
so
that
its
removal
may
in
some
cases
be
an
effectual
disguise
chapter
lxxxvii
while
jorian
was
putting
on
his
doublet
and
jerkin
to
go
to
tomb
his
tongue
was
not
idle
they
used
to
call
him
a
magician
out
sevenbergen
way
and
they
do
say
he
gave
a
touch
of
his
trade
at
parting
told
he
saw
margaret
lad
down
rhine
in
brave
clothes
and
store
o
money
but
his
face
scarred
by
foreign
glaive
and
not
altogether
so
many
arms
and
legs
as
a
went
away
wi
but
dear
heart
nought
came
o
margaret
is
still
wearying
for
her
lad
and
peter
he
lies
as
quiet
as
his
neighbours
not
but
what
she
hath
put
a
stone
slab
over
him
to
keep
him
where
he
is
as
you
shall
he
put
both
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
and
was
about
to
raise
himself
out
of
it
but
the
friar
laid
a
trembling
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
in
a
strange
whisper
how
long
since
died
peter
brandt
about
two
months
why
and
his
daughter
buried
him
say
you
nay
i
buried
him
but
she
paid
the
fee
and
reared
the
then
but
he
had
just
one
daughter
margaret
no
more
leastways
that
he
owned
then
you
think
margaret
is
is
alive
think
why
i
should
be
dead
else
riddle
me
alas
how
can
i
you
love
her
no
more
than
reason
being
a
married
man
and
father
of
four
more
sturdy
knaves
like
myself
nay
the
answer
is
she
saved
my
life
scarce
six
weeks
agone
now
had
she
been
dead
she
could
ha
kept
me
alive
bless
your
heart
i
could
keep
a
thing
on
my
stomach
nor
doctors
could
make
me
my
joan
says
time
to
buy
thee
a
shroud
dare
say
so
is
says
i
but
try
and
borrow
one
first
in
comes
my
lady
this
margaret
which
she
died
three
years
ago
by
your
way
o
opens
the
windows
makes
shift
me
where
i
lay
and
cures
me
in
the
twinkling
of
a
bedpost
but
wi
what
there
pinches
the
shoe
with
the
scurviest
herb
and
out
of
my
own
garden
too
with
sweet
feverfew
a
herb
quotha
is
a
weed
leastways
it
was
a
weed
till
it
cured
me
but
now
i
pass
my
hunch
i
doff
bonnet
and
says
i
service
why
how
now
father
you
look
wondrous
pale
and
now
you
are
red
and
now
you
are
white
why
what
is
the
matter
what
in
name
is
the
matter
the
surprise
the
joy
the
wonder
the
fear
gasped
clement
why
what
is
it
to
thee
art
thou
of
kin
to
margaret
brandt
nay
but
i
knew
one
that
loved
her
well
so
well
her
death
nigh
killed
him
body
and
soul
and
yet
thou
sayest
she
lives
and
i
believe
jorian
stared
and
after
a
considerable
silence
said
very
gravely
father
you
have
asked
me
many
questions
and
i
have
answered
them
truly
now
for
our
lady
sake
answer
me
but
two
did
you
in
very
sooth
know
one
who
loved
this
poor
lass
where
clement
was
on
the
point
of
revealing
himself
but
he
remembered
jerome
letter
and
shrank
from
being
called
by
the
name
he
had
borne
in
the
world
i
knew
him
in
italy
said
he
if
you
knew
him
you
can
tell
me
his
name
said
jorian
cautiously
his
name
was
gerard
oh
but
this
is
strange
stay
what
made
thee
say
margaret
brandt
was
dead
i
was
with
gerard
when
a
letter
came
from
margaret
van
eyck
the
letter
told
him
she
he
loved
was
dead
and
buried
let
me
sit
down
for
my
strength
fails
me
foul
play
foul
play
father
said
jorian
i
thank
heaven
for
sending
thee
to
me
ay
sit
ye
down
ye
do
look
like
a
ghost
ye
fast
overmuch
to
be
strong
my
mind
misgives
me
methinks
i
hold
the
clue
to
this
riddle
and
if
i
do
there
be
two
knaves
in
this
town
whose
heads
i
would
fain
batter
to
pieces
as
i
do
this
mould
and
he
clenched
his
teeth
and
raised
his
long
spade
above
his
head
and
brought
it
furiously
down
upon
the
heap
several
times
foul
play
you
never
said
a
truer
word
i
your
life
and
if
you
know
where
gerard
is
now
lose
no
time
but
show
him
the
trap
they
have
laid
for
him
mine
is
but
a
dull
head
but
whiles
the
slow
hound
puzzles
out
the
scent
go
to
and
i
do
think
you
and
i
ha
got
hold
of
two
ends
o
one
stick
and
a
main
foul
jorian
then
after
some
of
those
useless
preliminaries
men
of
his
class
always
deal
in
came
to
the
point
of
the
story
he
had
been
employed
by
the
burgomaster
of
tergou
to
repair
the
floor
of
an
upper
room
in
his
house
and
when
it
was
almost
done
coming
suddenly
to
fetch
away
his
tools
curiosity
had
been
excited
by
some
loud
words
below
and
he
had
lain
down
on
his
stomach
and
heard
the
burgomaster
talking
about
a
letter
which
cornelis
and
sybrandt
were
minded
to
convey
into
the
place
of
one
that
a
certain
hans
memling
was
taking
to
gerard
and
it
seems
their
will
was
good
but
their
stomach
was
small
so
to
give
them
courage
the
old
man
showed
them
a
drawer
full
of
silver
and
if
they
did
the
trick
they
should
each
put
a
hand
in
and
have
all
the
silver
they
could
hold
i
well
father
continued
jorian
i
thought
not
much
o
at
the
time
except
for
the
bargain
itself
that
kept
me
awake
mostly
all
night
think
o
next
morning
at
peep
of
day
who
should
i
see
but
my
masters
cornelis
and
sybrandt
come
out
of
their
house
each
with
a
black
eye
says
i
yon
hans
hath
put
his
mark
on
ye
well
now
i
hope
that
is
all
you
have
got
for
your
pains
did
they
make
for
the
burgomaster
house
i
to
my
at
this
part
of
jorian
revelation
the
monk
nostril
dilated
and
his
restless
eye
showed
the
suspense
he
was
in
well
father
continued
jorian
the
burgomaster
brought
them
into
that
same
room
he
had
a
letter
in
his
hand
but
i
am
no
scholar
however
i
have
got
as
many
eyes
in
my
head
as
the
pope
hath
and
i
saw
the
drawer
opened
and
those
two
knaves
put
in
each
a
hand
and
draw
it
out
full
and
saints
in
glory
how
they
tried
to
hold
more
and
more
and
more
o
yon
stuff
and
sybrandt
he
had
daubed
his
hand
in
something
sticky
i
think
was
glue
and
he
made
shift
to
carry
one
or
two
pieces
away
a
sticking
to
the
back
of
his
hand
he
he
he
is
a
sin
to
laugh
so
you
see
luck
was
on
the
wrong
side
as
usual
they
had
done
the
trick
but
how
they
did
it
that
methinks
will
never
be
known
till
doomsday
go
to
they
left
their
immortal
jewels
in
yon
drawer
well
they
got
a
handful
of
silver
for
them
the
devil
had
the
worst
o
yon
bargain
there
father
that
is
off
my
mind
often
i
longed
to
tell
it
some
one
but
i
durst
not
to
the
women
or
margaret
would
not
have
had
a
friend
left
in
the
world
for
those
two
villains
are
the
favourites
is
always
so
have
not
the
old
folk
just
taken
a
brave
new
shop
for
them
in
this
very
town
in
the
hoog
straet
there
may
you
see
their
sign
a
gilt
sheep
and
a
lambkin
a
brace
of
wolves
sucking
their
dam
would
be
nigher
the
mark
and
there
the
whole
family
feast
this
day
oh
is
a
fine
world
what
not
a
word
holy
father
you
sit
there
like
stone
and
have
not
even
a
curse
to
bestow
on
them
the
miscreants
what
was
it
not
enough
the
poor
lad
was
all
alone
in
a
strange
land
must
his
own
flesh
and
blood
go
and
lie
away
the
one
blessing
his
enemies
had
left
him
and
then
think
of
her
pining
and
pining
all
these
years
and
sitting
at
the
window
looking
adown
the
street
for
gerard
and
so
constant
so
tender
and
true
my
wife
says
she
is
sure
no
woman
ever
loved
a
man
truer
than
she
loves
the
lad
those
villains
have
parted
from
her
and
the
day
never
passes
but
she
weeps
salt
tears
for
him
and
when
i
think
that
but
for
those
two
greedy
lying
knaves
yon
winsome
lad
whose
life
i
saved
might
be
by
her
side
this
day
the
happiest
he
in
holland
and
the
sweet
lass
that
saved
my
life
might
be
sitting
with
her
cheek
upon
her
sweetheart
shoulder
the
happiest
she
in
holland
in
place
of
the
saddest
oh
i
thirst
for
their
blood
the
nasty
sneaking
lying
cogging
cowardly
heartless
bowelless
how
now
the
monk
started
wildly
up
livid
with
fury
and
despair
and
rushed
headlong
from
the
place
with
both
hands
clenched
and
raised
on
high
so
terrible
was
this
inarticulate
burst
of
fury
that
jorian
puny
ire
died
out
at
sight
of
it
and
he
stood
looking
dismayed
after
the
human
tempest
he
had
launched
while
thus
absorbed
he
felt
his
arm
grasped
by
a
small
tremulous
hand
it
was
margaret
brandt
he
started
her
coming
there
just
then
seemed
so
strange
she
had
waited
long
on
peter
tombstone
but
the
friar
did
not
come
so
she
went
into
the
church
to
see
if
he
was
there
still
she
could
not
find
him
presently
going
up
the
south
aisle
the
gigantic
shadow
of
a
friar
came
rapidly
along
the
floor
and
part
of
a
pillar
and
seemed
to
pass
through
her
she
was
near
screaming
but
in
a
moment
remembered
jorian
shadow
had
come
in
so
from
the
churchyard
and
tried
to
clamber
out
the
nearest
way
she
did
so
but
with
some
difficulty
and
by
that
time
clement
was
just
disappearing
down
the
street
yet
so
expressive
at
times
is
the
body
as
well
as
the
face
she
could
see
he
was
greatly
agitated
jorian
and
she
looked
at
one
another
and
at
the
wild
figure
of
the
distant
friar
well
said
she

penned
yon
lie
but
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
and
those
foul
knaves
cornelis
and
sybrandt

changed
the
true
letter
for
one
of
their
own
i
told
him
as
how
i
saw
the
whole
villainy
done
through
a
chink
and

give
them
their
lesson

a
man
was
mad
with
rage
its
yon
he
turned
black
and
white
and
parted
like
a
stone
from
a
sling

was
thunder
in

silence
on

jerkin

has
been
a
mother
to
the
shop
was
a
corner
house
with
two
doors
one
in
the
main
street
for
customers
and
a
round
the
corner
margaret
and
jorian
were
now
within
twenty
yards
of
the
shop
when
they
heard
a
roar
inside
like
as
of
some
wild
animal
and
the
friar
burst
out
white
and
raging
and
went
tearing
down
the
street
margaret
screamed
and
sank
fainting
on
jorian
arm
jorian
shouted
after
him
stay
madman

thy
but
he
was
deaf
and
went
headlong
shaking
his
clenched
fists
high
high
in
the
air
help
me
in
good
jorian
moaned
margaret
turning
suddenly
calm
let
me
know
the
worst
and
he
supported
her
trembling
limbs
into
the
house
it
seemed
unnaturally
still
not
a
sound
jorian
own
heart
beat
fast
a
door
was
before
him
unlatched
he
pushed
it
softly
with
his
left
hand
and
margaret
and
he
stood
on
the
threshold
what
they
saw
there
you
shall
soon
know
chapter
lxxxviii
it
was
eli
family
were
collected
round
the
board
margaret
only
was
missing
to
catherine
surprise
eli
said
he
would
wait
a
bit
for
her
why
i
told
her
you
would
not
wait
for
the
she
is
not
the
duke
she
is
a
poor
good
lass
that
hath
waited
not
minutes
but
years
for
a
graceless
son
of
mine
you
can
put
the
meat
on
the
board
all
the
same
then
we
can
fall
to
without
farther
loss
time
when
she
does
the
smoking
dishes
smelt
so
savoury
that
eli
gave
way
she
will
come
if
we
begin
said
he
they
always
do
come
sit
ye
down
mistress
joan
not
here
for
a
slave
i
trow
but
a
guest
there
i
hear
a
quick
step
off
covers
and
fall
the
covers
were
withdrawn
and
the
knives
brandished
then
burst
into
the
room
not
the
expected
margaret
but
a
dominican
friar
livid
with
rage
he
was
at
the
table
in
a
moment
in
front
of
cornelis
and
sybrandt
threw
his
tall
body
over
the
narrow
table
and
with
two
hands
hovering
above
their
shrinking
heads
like
eagles
over
a
quarry
he
cursed
them
by
name
soul
and
body
in
this
world
and
the
next
it
was
an
age
eloquent
in
curses
and
this
curse
was
so
full
so
minute
so
blighting
blasting
withering
and
tremendous
that
i
am
afraid
to
put
all
the
words
on
paper
cursed
be
the
lips
he
shrieked
which
spoke
the
lie
that
margaret
was
dead
may
they
rot
before
the
grave
and
kiss
iron
in
hell
thereafter
doubly
cursed
be
the
hands
that
changed
those
letters
and
be
they
struck
off
by
the
hangman
knife
and
handle
hell
fire
for
ever
thrice
accursed
be
the
cruel
hearts
that
did
conceive
that
damned
lie
to
part
true
love
for
ever
may
they
sicken
and
wither
on
earth
joyless
loveless
hopeless
and
wither
to
dust
before
their
time
and
burn
in
eternal
fire
he
cursed
the
meat
at
their
mouths
and
every
atom
of
their
bodies
from
their
hair
to
the
soles
of
their
feet
then
turning
from
the
cowering
shuddering
pair
who
had
almost
hid
themselves
beneath
the
table
he
tore
a
letter
out
of
his
bosom
and
flung
it
down
before
his
father
read
that
thou
hard
old
man
that
didst
imprison
thy
son
read
and
see
what
monsters
thou
hast
brought
into
the
world
the
memory
of
my
wrongs
and
hers
dwell
with
you
all
for
ever
i
will
meet
you
again
at
the
judgment
day
on
earth
ye
will
never
see
me
and
in
a
moment
as
he
had
come
so
he
was
gone
leaving
them
stiff
and
cold
and
white
as
statues
round
the
smoking
board
and
this
was
the
sight
that
greeted
margaret
eyes
and
jorian
pale
figures
of
men
and
women
petrified
around
the
untasted
food
as
eastern
poets
feigned
margaret
glanced
her
eye
round
and
gasped
out
oh
joy
all
here
no
blood
hath
been
shed
oh
you
cruel
cruel
men
i
thank
god
he
hath
not
slain
at
sight
of
her
catherine
gave
an
eloquent
scream
then
turned
her
head
away
but
eli
who
had
just
cast
his
eye
over
the
false
letter
and
begun
to
understand
it
all
seeing
the
other
victim
come
in
at
that
very
moment
with
her
wrongs
reflected
in
her
sweet
pale
face
started
to
his
feet
in
a
transport
of
rage
and
shouted
stand
clear
and
let
me
get
at
the
traitors
i
hang
for
them
and
in
a
moment
he
whipped
out
his
short
sword
and
fell
upon
them
fly
screamed
margaret
fly
they
slipped
howling
under
the
table
and
crawled
out
the
other
side
but
ere
they
could
get
to
the
door
the
furious
old
man
ran
round
and
intercepted
them
catherine
only
screamed
and
wrung
her
hands
your
notables
are
generally
useless
at
such
a
time
and
blood
would
certainly
have
flowed
but
margaret
and
jorian
seized
the
fiery
old
man
arms
and
held
them
with
all
their
might
whilst
the
pair
got
clear
of
the
house
then
they
let
him
go
and
he
went
vainly
raging
after
them
out
into
the
street
they
were
a
furlong
off
running
like
hares
he
hacked
down
the
board
on
which
their
names
were
written
and
brought
it
indoors
and
flung
it
into
the
catherine
was
sitting
rocking
herself
with
her
apron
over
her
head
joan
had
run
to
her
husband
margaret
had
her
arms
round
catherine
neck
and
pale
and
panting
was
yet
making
efforts
to
comfort
her
but
it
was
not
to
be
done
oh
my
poor
children
she
cried
oh
miserable
mother
is
a
mercy
kate
was
ill
upstairs
there
i
have
lived
to
thank
god
for
that
she
cried
with
a
fresh
burst
of
sobs
it
would
have
killed
her
he
had
better
have
stayed
in
italy
as
come
home
to
curse
his
own
flesh
and
blood
and
set
us
all
by
the
ears
oh
hold
your
chat
woman
cried
eli
angrily
you
are
still
on
the
side
of
the
you
are
cheap
served
your
weakness
made
the
rogues
what
they
are
i
was
for
correcting
them
in
their
youth
for
sore
ills
sharp
remedies
but
you
still
sided
with
their
faults
and
undermined
me
and
baffled
wise
severity
and
you
margaret
leave
comforting
her
that
ought
rather
to
comfort
you
for
what
is
her
hurt
to
yours
but
she
never
had
a
grain
of
justice
under
her
skin
and
never
will
so
come
thou
to
me
that
am
thy
father
from
this
this
was
a
command
so
she
kissed
catherine
and
went
tottering
to
him
and
he
put
her
on
a
chair
beside
him
and
she
laid
her
feeble
head
on
his
honest
breast
but
not
a
tear
it
was
too
deep
for
that
poor
lamb
said
he
after
a
while
come
good
folks
said
true
eli
in
a
broken
voice
to
jorian
and
joan
we
are
in
a
little
trouble
as
you
see
but
that
is
no
reason
you
should
starve
for
our
lady
sake
fall
to
and
add
not
to
my
grief
the
reputation
of
a
churl
what
the
dickens
added
he
with
a
sudden
ghastly
attempt
at
the
more
knaves
i
have
the
luck
to
get
shut
of
the
more
my
need
of
true
men
and
women
to
help
me
clear
the
dish
and
cheer
mine
eye
with
honest
faces
about
me
where
else
were
gaps
fall
to
i
do
entreat
catherine
sobbing
backed
his
request
poor
simple
antique
hospitable
souls
jorian
whose
appetite
especially
since
his
illness
was
very
keen
was
for
acting
on
this
hospitable
invitation
but
joan
whispered
a
word
in
his
ear
and
he
instantly
drew
back
nay
touch
no
meat
that
holy
church
hath
in
sooth
i
forgot
said
eli
apologetically
my
son
who
was
reared
at
my
table
hath
cursed
my
victuals
that
seems
strange
well
what
god
wills
man
must
bow
the
supper
was
flung
out
into
the
yard
jorian
took
his
wife
home
and
heavy
sadness
reigned
in
eli
house
that
night
meantime
where
was
clement
lying
at
full
length
upon
the
floor
of
the
convent
church
with
his
lips
upon
the
lowest
step
of
the
altar
in
an
indescribable
state
of
terror
misery
penitence
and
through
all
which
struggled
gleams
of
joy
that
margaret
was
alive
night
fell
and
found
him
lying
there
weeping
and
praying
and
morning
would
have
found
him
there
too
but
he
suddenly
remembered
that
absorbed
in
his
own
wrongs
and
margaret
he
had
committed
another
sin
besides
intemperate
rage
he
had
neglected
a
dying
man
he
rose
instantly
groaning
at
his
accumulated
wickedness
and
set
out
to
repair
the
omission
the
weather
had
changed
it
was
raining
hard
and
when
he
got
clear
of
the
town
he
heard
the
wolves
baying
they
were
on
the
foot
but
clement
was
himself
again
or
nearly
he
thought
little
of
danger
or
discomfort
having
a
shameful
omission
of
religious
duty
to
repair
he
went
stoutly
forward
through
rain
and
darkness
and
as
he
went
he
often
beat
his
breast
and
cried
mea
culpa
mea
culpa
chapter
lxxxix
what
that
sensitive
mind
and
tender
conscience
and
loving
heart
and
religious
soul
went
through
even
in
a
few
hours
under
a
situation
so
sudden
and
tremendous
is
perhaps
beyond
the
power
of
words
to
paint
fancy
yourself
the
man
and
then
put
yourself
in
his
place
were
i
to
write
a
volume
on
it
we
should
have
to
come
to
that
at
last
i
shall
relate
his
next
two
overt
acts
they
indicate
his
state
of
mind
after
the
first
fierce
tempest
of
the
soul
had
subsided
after
spending
the
night
with
the
dying
hermit
in
giving
and
receiving
holy
consolations
he
set
out
not
for
rotterdam
but
for
tergou
he
went
there
to
confront
his
fatal
enemy
the
burgomaster
and
by
means
of
that
parchment
whose
history
was
itself
a
romance
to
make
him
disgorge
and
give
margaret
her
own
heated
and
dusty
he
stopped
at
the
fountain
and
there
began
to
eat
his
black
bread
and
drink
of
the
water
but
in
the
middle
of
his
frugal
meal
a
female
servant
came
running
and
begged
him
to
come
and
shrive
her
dying
master
he
returned
the
bread
to
his
wallet
and
followed
her
without
a
word
she
took
him
to
the
stadthouse
he
drew
back
with
a
little
shudder
when
he
saw
her
go
in
but
he
almost
instantly
recovered
himself
and
followed
her
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
and
there
in
bed
propped
up
by
pillows
lay
his
deadly
enemy
looking
already
like
a
corpse
clement
eyed
him
a
moment
from
the
door
and
thought
of
all
the
tower
the
wood
the
letter
then
he
said
in
a
low
voice
pax
vobiscum
he
trembled
a
little
while
he
said
it
the
sick
man
welcomed
him
as
eagerly
as
his
weak
state
permitted
thank
heaven
thou
art
come
in
time
to
absolve
me
from
my
sins
father
and
pray
for
my
soul
thou
and
thy
my
son
said
clement
before
absolution
cometh
confession
in
which
act
there
must
be
no
reservation
as
thou
valuest
thy
soul
weal
bethink
thee
therefore
wherein
thou
hast
most
offended
god
and
the
church
while
i
offer
up
a
prayer
for
wisdom
to
direct
clement
then
kneeled
and
prayed
and
when
he
rose
from
his
knees
he
said
to
ghysbrecht
with
apparent
calmness
my
son
confess
thy
ah
father
said
the
sick
man
they
are
many
and
great
then
be
thy
penitence
my
son
so
shalt
thou
find
god
mercy
ghysbrecht
put
his
hands
together
and
began
to
confess
with
every
appearance
of
contrition
he
owned
he
had
eaten
meat
in
he
had
often
absented
himself
from
mass
on
the
lord
day
and
saints
days
and
had
trifled
with
other
religious
observances
which
he
enumerated
with
scrupulous
fidelity
when
he
had
done
the
friar
said
quietly
is
well
my
son
these
be
faults
now
to
thy
crimes
thou
hadst
done
better
to
begin
with
why
father
what
crimes
lie
to
my
account
if
these
be
none
am
i
confessing
to
thee
or
thou
to
me
said
clement
somewhat
severely
forgive
me
father
why
surely
i
to
you
but
i
know
not
what
you
call
the
seven
deadly
sins
art
thou
clear
of
them
heaven
forefend
i
should
be
guilty
of
them
i
know
them
not
by
many
do
them
all
that
can
not
name
them
begin
with
that
one
which
leads
to
lying
theft
and
i
am
quit
of
that
one
any
way
how
call
you
it
avarice
my
avarice
oh
as
to
that
i
have
been
a
saving
man
all
my
day
but
i
have
kept
a
good
table
and
not
altogether
forgotten
the
poor
but
alas
i
am
a
great
sinner
mayhap
the
next
will
catch
me
what
is
the
next
we
have
not
yet
done
with
this
one
bethink
thee
the
church
is
not
to
be
trifled
alas
am
i
in
a
condition
to
trifle
with
her
now
avarice
avarice
he
looked
puzzled
and
innocent
hast
thou
ever
robbed
the
fatherless
inquired
the
friar
me
robbed
the
fatherless
gasped
ghysbrecht
not
that
i
once
more
my
son
i
am
forced
to
tell
thee
thou
art
trifling
with
the
church
miserable
man
another
evasion
and
i
leave
thee
and
fiends
will
straightway
gather
round
thy
bed
and
tear
thee
down
to
the
bottomless
oh
leave
me
not
leave
me
not
shrieked
the
terrified
old
man
the
church
knows
all
i
must
have
robbed
the
fatherless
i
will
confess
who
shall
i
begin
with
my
memory
for
names
is
the
defence
was
skilful
but
in
this
case
failed
hast
thou
forgotten
floris
brandt
said
clement
stonily
the
sick
man
reared
himself
in
bed
in
a
pitiable
state
of
terror
how
knew
you
that
said
he
the
church
knows
many
things
said
clement
coldly
and
by
many
ways
that
are
dark
to
thee
miserable
impenitent
you
called
her
to
your
side
hoping
to
deceive
her
you
said
will
not
confess
to
the
cure
but
to
some
friar
who
knows
not
my
misdeeds
so
will
i
cheat
the
church
on
my
deathbed
and
die
as
i
have
lived
but
god
kinder
to
thee
than
thou
art
to
thyself
sent
to
thee
one
whom
thou
couldst
not
deceive
he
has
tried
thee
he
was
patient
with
thee
and
warned
thee
not
to
trifle
with
holy
church
but
all
is
in
vain
thou
canst
not
confess
for
thou
art
impenitent
as
a
stone
die
then
as
thou
hast
lived
methinks
i
see
the
fiends
crowding
round
the
bed
for
their
prey
they
wait
but
for
me
to
go
and
i
he
turned
his
back
but
ghysbrecht
in
extremity
of
terror
caught
him
by
the
frock
oh
holy
man
mercy
stay
i
will
confess
all
all
i
robbed
my
friend
floris
alas
would
it
had
ended
there
for
he
lost
little
by
me
but
i
kept
the
land
from
peter
his
son
and
from
margaret
peter
daughter
yet
i
was
always
going
to
give
it
back
but
i
could
i
avarice
my
son
avarice
happy
for
thee
is
not
too
no
i
will
leave
it
her
by
will
she
will
not
have
long
to
wait
for
it
now
not
above
a
month
or
two
at
for
which
month
possession
thou
wouldst
damn
thy
soul
for
ever
thou
fool
the
sick
man
groaned
and
prayed
the
friar
to
be
reasonable
the
friar
firmly
but
gently
and
persuasively
persisted
and
with
infinite
patience
detached
the
dying
man
gripe
from
property
there
were
times
when
his
patience
was
tried
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
bosom
and
producing
the
deed
which
he
had
brought
for
that
purpose
but
after
yesterday
outbreak
he
was
on
his
guard
against
choler
and
to
conclude
he
conquered
his
impatience
he
conquered
a
personal
repugnance
to
the
man
so
strong
as
to
make
his
own
flesh
creep
all
the
time
he
was
struggling
with
this
miser
for
his
soul
and
at
last
without
a
word
about
the
deed
he
won
upon
him
to
make
full
and
prompt
restitution
how
the
restitution
was
made
will
be
briefly
related
elsewhere
also
certain
curious
effects
produced
upon
ghysbrecht
by
it
and
when
and
on
what
terms
ghysbrecht
and
clement
parted
i
promised
to
relate
two
acts
of
the
latter
indicative
of
his
mind
this
is
one
the
other
is
told
in
two
words
as
soon
as
he
was
quite
sure
margaret
had
her
own
and
was
a
rich
woman
he
disappeared
chapter
xc
it
was
the
day
after
that
terrible
scene
the
little
house
in
the
hoog
straet
was
like
a
grave
and
none
more
listless
and
dejected
than
catherine
so
busy
and
sprightly
by
nature
after
dinner
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
she
went
to
the
convent
to
try
and
soften
gerard
and
lay
the
first
stone
at
least
of
a
reconciliation
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
make
the
porter
understand
whom
she
was
seeking
eventually
she
learned
he
had
left
late
last
night
and
was
not
expected
back
she
went
sighing
with
the
news
to
margaret
she
found
her
sitting
idle
like
one
with
whom
life
had
lost
its
savour
she
had
her
boy
clasped
so
tight
in
her
arms
as
if
he
was
all
she
had
left
and
she
feared
some
one
would
take
him
too
catherine
begged
her
to
come
to
the
hoog
straet
what
for
sighed
margaret
you
can
not
but
say
to
yourselves
she
is
the
cause
of
nay
nay
said
catherine
we
are
not
so
and
eli
is
so
fond
on
you
you
will
maybe
soften
oh
if
you
think
i
can
do
any
good
i
come
said
margaret
with
a
weary
sigh
they
found
eli
and
a
carpenter
putting
up
another
name
in
place
of
cornelis
and
sybrandt
and
what
should
that
name
be
but
margaret
brandt
with
all
her
affection
for
margaret
this
went
through
poor
catherine
like
a
knife
the
bane
of
one
is
another
meat
said
she
can
he
make
me
spend
the
money
unjustly
replied
margaret
coldly
you
are
a
good
soul
said
catherine
ay
so
best
sith
he
is
the
the
next
day
giles
dropped
in
and
catherine
told
the
story
all
in
favour
of
the
black
sheep
and
invited
his
pity
for
them
anathematized
by
their
brother
and
turned
on
the
wide
world
by
their
father
but
giles
prejudices
ran
the
other
way
he
heard
her
out
and
told
her
bluntly
the
knaves
had
got
off
cheap
they
deserved
to
be
hanged
at
margaret
door
into
the
bargain
and
dismissing
them
with
contempt
crowed
with
delight
at
the
return
of
his
favourite
i
show
him
said
he
what
is
to
have
a
brother
at
court
with
a
heart
to
serve
a
friend
and
a
head
to
point
the
bless
thee
giles
murmured
margaret
softly
thou
wast
ever
his
stanch
friend
dear
giles
said
little
kate
but
alack
i
know
not
what
thou
canst
do
for
him
giles
had
left
them
and
all
was
sad
and
silent
again
when
a
man
opened
the
door
softly
and
asked
was
margaret
brandt
here
d
hear
lass
you
are
wanted
said
catherine
briskly
in
her
the
gossip
was
indestructible
well
mother
said
margaret
listlessly
and
here
i
a
shuffling
of
feet
was
heard
at
the
door
and
a
colourless
feeble
old
man
was
assisted
into
the
room
it
was
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
at
sight
of
him
catherine
shrieked
and
threw
her
apron
over
her
head
and
margaret
shuddered
violently
and
turned
her
head
swiftly
away
not
to
see
him
a
feeble
voice
issued
from
the
strange
visitor
lips
good
people
a
dying
man
hath
come
to
ask
your
come
to
look
on
your
work
you
mean
said
catherine
taking
down
her
apron
and
bursting
out
sobbing
there
there
she
is
fainting
look
to
her
eli
nay
said
margaret
in
a
feeble
voice
the
sight
of
him
gave
me
a
turn
that
is
all
prithee
let
him
say
his
say
and
go
for
he
is
the
murderer
of
me
and
alas
said
ghysbrecht
i
am
too
feeble
to
say
it
standing
and
no
one
biddeth
me
sit
eli
who
had
followed
him
into
the
house
interfered
here
and
said
half
sullenly
half
apologetically
well
burgomaster
is
not
our
wont
to
leave
a
visitor
standing
whiles
we
sit
but
man
man
you
have
wrought
us
too
much
and
the
honest
fellow
voice
began
to
shake
with
anger
he
fought
hard
to
contain
because
it
was
his
own
house
then
ghysbrecht
found
an
advocate
in
one
who
seldom
spoke
in
vain
in
that
family
it
was
little
kate
father
mother
said
she
my
duty
to
you
but
this
is
not
well
death
squares
all
accounts
and
see
you
not
death
in
his
face
i
shall
not
live
long
good
friends
and
his
time
is
shorter
than
eli
made
haste
and
set
a
chair
for
their
dying
enemy
with
his
own
hands
ghysbrecht
attendants
put
him
into
it
go
fetch
the
boxes
said
he
they
brought
in
two
boxes
and
then
retired
leaving
their
master
alone
in
the
family
he
had
so
cruelly
injured
every
eye
was
now
bent
on
him
except
margaret
he
undid
the
boxes
with
unsteady
fingers
and
brought
out
of
one
the
of
a
property
at
tergou
this
land
and
these
houses
belonged
to
floris
brandt
and
do
belong
to
thee
of
right
his
granddaughter
these
i
did
usurp
for
a
debt
long
since
defrayed
with
interest
these
i
now
restore
their
rightful
owner
with
penitent
tears
in
this
other
box
are
three
hundred
and
forty
golden
angels
being
the
rent
and
fines
i
have
received
from
that
land
more
than
floris
brandt
debt
to
me
i
have
kept
it
compt
still
meaning
to
be
just
one
day
but
avarice
withheld
me
pray
good
people
against
temptation
i
was
not
born
dishonest
yet
you
well
to
be
sure
cried
catherine
and
you
the
burgomaster
hast
whipt
good
store
of
thieves
in
thy
day
however
said
she
on
second
thoughts
is
better
late
than
never
what
margaret
art
deaf
the
good
man
hath
brought
thee
back
thine
own
art
a
rich
woman
alack
what
a
mountain
o
gold
bid
him
keep
land
and
gold
and
give
me
back
my
gerard
that
he
stole
from
me
with
his
treason
said
margaret
with
her
head
still
averted
alas
said
ghysbrecht
would
i
could
what
i
can
i
have
done
is
it
nought
it
cost
me
a
sore
struggle
and
i
rose
from
my
last
bed
to
do
it
myself
lest
some
mischance
should
come
between
her
and
her
old
man
said
margaret
since
thou
whose
idol
is
pelf
hast
done
this
god
and
the
saints
will
as
i
hope
forgive
thee
as
for
me
i
am
neither
saint
nor
angel
but
only
a
poor
woman
whose
heart
thou
hast
broken
speak
to
him
kate
for
i
am
like
the
kate
meditated
a
little
while
and
then
her
soft
silvery
voice
fell
like
a
soothing
melody
upon
the
air
my
poor
sister
hath
a
sorrow
that
riches
can
not
heal
give
her
time
ghysbrecht
is
not
in
nature
she
should
forgive
thee
all
her
boy
is
fatherless
and
she
is
neither
maid
wife
nor
widow
and
the
blow
fell
but
two
days
syne
that
laid
her
heart
a
a
single
heavy
sob
from
margaret
was
the
comment
to
these
words
therefore
give
her
time
and
ere
thou
diest
she
will
forgive
thee
all
ay
even
to
pleasure
me
that
haply
shall
not
be
long
behind
thee
ghysbrecht
meantime
we
whose
wounds
be
sore
but
not
so
deep
as
hers
do
pardon
thee
a
penitent
and
a
dying
man
and
i
for
one
will
pray
for
thee
from
this
hour
go
in
peace
their
little
oracle
had
spoken
it
was
enough
eli
even
invited
him
to
break
a
manchet
and
drink
a
stoup
of
wine
to
give
him
heart
for
his
journey
but
ghysbrecht
declined
and
said
what
he
had
done
was
a
cordial
to
him
man
seeth
but
a
little
way
before
him
neighbour
this
land
i
clung
so
to
it
was
a
bed
of
nettles
to
me
all
the
time
is
gone
and
i
feel
happier
and
livelier
like
for
the
loss
he
called
his
men
and
they
lifted
him
into
the
litter
when
he
was
gone
catherine
gloated
over
the
money
she
had
never
seen
so
much
together
and
was
almost
angry
with
margaret
for
sitting
out
there
like
an
and
she
dilated
on
the
advantages
of
money
and
she
teased
margaret
till
at
last
she
prevailed
on
her
to
come
and
look
at
it
better
let
her
be
mother
said
kate
how
can
she
relish
gold
with
a
heart
in
her
bosom
liker
lead
but
catherine
persisted
the
result
was
margaret
looked
down
at
all
her
wealth
with
wondering
eyes
then
suddenly
wrung
her
hands
and
cried
with
piercing
anguish
too
late
too
late
and
shook
off
her
leaden
despondency
only
to
go
into
strong
hysterics
over
the
wealth
that
came
too
late
to
be
shared
with
him
she
loved
a
little
of
this
gold
a
portion
of
this
land
a
year
or
two
ago
when
it
was
as
much
her
own
as
now
and
gerard
would
have
never
left
her
side
for
italy
or
any
other
place
too
late
too
late
chapter
xci
not
many
days
after
this
came
the
news
that
margaret
van
eyck
was
dead
and
buried
by
a
will
she
had
made
a
year
before
she
left
all
her
property
after
her
funeral
expenses
and
certain
presents
to
reicht
heynes
to
her
dear
daughter
margaret
brandt
requesting
her
to
keep
reicht
as
long
as
unmarried
by
this
will
margaret
inherited
a
furnished
house
and
pictures
and
sketches
that
in
the
present
day
would
be
a
fortune
among
the
pictures
was
one
she
valued
more
than
a
gallery
of
others
it
represented
a
the
solemnity
of
the
ceremony
was
marked
in
the
grave
face
of
the
man
and
the
demure
complacency
of
the
woman
she
was
painted
almost
entirely
by
margaret
van
eyck
but
the
rest
of
the
picture
by
jan
the
accessories
were
exquisitely
finished
and
remain
a
marvel
of
skill
to
this
day
margaret
brandt
sent
word
to
reicht
to
stay
in
the
house
till
such
time
as
she
could
find
the
heart
to
put
foot
in
it
and
miss
the
face
and
voice
that
used
to
meet
her
there
and
to
take
special
care
of
the
picture
in
the
little
cubboord
meaning
the
diptych
the
next
thing
was
luke
peterson
came
home
and
heard
that
gerard
was
a
monk
he
was
like
to
go
mad
with
joy
he
came
to
margaret
and
said
heed
mistress
if
he
can
not
marry

i
you
said
margaret
why

and
ask
him
whether
you
are
married
or
nay
i
shall
ask
my
own
heart
not
a
lawyer
so
that
is
your
regard
for
me
to
go
making
me
the
town
talk
oh
fie
that
is
done
already
without
a
word
from
but
not
by
such
as

my
respect
and
if
you
do
it
never
come
nigh
me
ay
said
luke
with
a
sigh
you
are
like
a
dove
to
all
the
rest
but
you
are
a
hardhearted
tyrant
to
is
your
own
fault
dear
luke
for
wooing
me
that
is
what
lets
me
from
being
as
kind
to
you
as
i
desire
luke
my
bonny
lad
listen
to
me
i
am
rich
now

round
the
street

round
the
parish
there
is
many
a
quean
in
it

and
not
spoiled

weeping

your
choice

you
to
the
lass

speak
to
the
mother
they

not
say
thee

very
red
but

your
liking

your
money

was
your
servant

took
you
for
so
part
we
withouten
malice

you
your

road
where
never
a
she
did
find
it
yet
and
for
me
i
live
and
die
a
bachelor
good
even
farewell
dear
luke
and
god
forgive
you
for
saying
that
to
for
some
days
margaret
dreaded
almost
as
much
as
she
desired
the
coming
interview
with
gerard
she
said
to
herself
i
wonder
not
he
keeps
away
a
while
for
so
should
however
he
would
hear
he
was
a
father
and
the
desire
to
see
their
boy
would
overcome
everything
and
said
the
poor
girl
to
herself
if
so
be
that
meeting
does
not
kill
me
i
feel
i
shall
be
better
after
it
than
i
am
but
when
day
after
day
went
by
and
he
was
not
heard
of
a
freezing
suspicion
began
to
crawl
and
creep
towards
her
mind
what
if
his
absence
was
intentional
what
if
he
had
gone
to
some
monks
his
fellows
and
they
had
told
him
never
to
see
her
more
the
convent
had
ere
this
shown
itself
as
merciless
to
true
lovers
as
the
grave
itself
at
this
thought
the
very
life
seemed
to
die
out
of
her
and
now
for
the
first
time
deep
indignation
mingled
at
times
with
her
grief
and
apprehension
can
he
have
ever
loved
me
to
run
from
me
and
his
boy
without
a
word
why
this
poor
luke
thinks
more
of
me
than
he
while
her
mind
was
in
this
state
giles
came
roaring
i
hit
the
clout
our
gerard
is
vicar
of
a
very
brief
sketch
of
the
dwarf
court
life
will
suffice
to
prepare
the
reader
for
his
own
account
of
this
feat
some
months
before
he
went
to
court
his
intelligence
had
budded
he
himself
dated
the
change
from
a
certain
of
june
when
swinging
by
one
hand
along
with
the
washing
on
a
tight
rope
in
the
drying
ground
something
went
crack
inside
his
head
and
lo
intellectual
powers
unchained
at
court
his
shrewdness
and
bluntness
of
speech
coupled
with
his
gigantic
voice
and
his
small
stature
made
him
a
power
without
the
last
item
i
fear
they
would
have
conducted
him
to
that
unpopular
gymnasium
the
gallows
the
young
duchess
of
burgundy
and
marie
the
heiress
apparent
both
petted
him
as
great
ladies
have
petted
dwarfs
in
all
ages
and
the
court
poet
melted
butter
by
the
rule
and
poured
enough
of
it
down
his
back
to
stew
goliah
in
he
even
amplified
versified
and
enfeebled
certain
rough
and
ready
sentences
dictated
by
giles
the
centipedal
prolixity
that
resulted
went
to
eli
by
letter
thus
entitled
the
high
and
puissant
princess
marie
of
bourgogne
her
lytel
jantilman
hys
complaynt
of
y
coort
and
praise
of
a
rusticall
lyfe
versificated
and
empapyred
by
me
the
lytel
jantilman
right
lovynge
and
obsequious
servitor
but
the
dwarf
reached
his
climax
by
a
happy
mixture
of
mind
and
muscle
thus
the
day
before
a
grand
court
joust
he
challenged
the
duke
giant
to
a
trial
of
strength
this
challenge
made
the
gravest
grin
and
aroused
expectation
giles
had
a
lofty
pole
planted
ready
and
at
the
appointed
hour
went
up
it
like
a
squirrel
and
by
strength
of
arm
made
a
right
angle
with
his
body
and
so
remained
then
slid
down
so
quickly
that
the
high
and
puissant
princess
squeaked
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
not
to
see
the
demise
of
her
the
giant
effected
only
about
ten
feet
then
looked
ruefully
up
and
ruefully
down
and
descended
bathed
in
perspiration
to
argue
the
matter
it
was
not
the
dwarf
greater
strength
but
his
smaller
the
spectators
received
this
excuse
with
loud
derision
there
was
the
fact
the
dwarf
was
great
at
mounting
a
pole
the
giant
only
great
at
excuses
in
short
giles
had
gauged
their
intellects
with
his
own
body
no
doubt
come
said
he
an
ye
go
to
that
i
wrestle
ye
my
lad
if
so
be
you
will
let
me
blindfold
your
the
giant
smarting
under
defeat
and
thinking
he
could
surely
recover
it
by
this
means
readily
consented
madam
said
giles
see
you
yon
blind
samson
at
a
signal
from
me
he
shall
make
me
a
low
obeisance
and
unbonnet
to
how
may
that
be
being
blinded
inquired
a
maid
of
honour
i
wager
on
giles
for
one
said
the
princess
that
is
my
when
several
wagers
were
laid
pro
and
con
giles
hit
the
giant
in
the
he
went
double
the
obeisance
and
his
bonnet
fell
off
the
company
yelled
with
delight
at
this
delicate
stroke
of
wit
and
giles
took
to
his
heels
the
giant
followed
as
soon
as
he
could
recover
his
breath
and
tear
off
his
bandage
but
it
was
too
late
giles
had
prepared
a
little
door
in
the
wall
through
which
he
could
pass
but
not
a
giant
and
had
coloured
it
so
artfully
it
looked
like
a
wall
this
door
he
tore
open
and
went
headlong
through
leaving
no
vestige
but
this
posy
written
very
large
upon
the
reverse
of
his
trick
door
long
limbs
big
body
panting
wit
by
wee
and
wise
is
bet
and
bit
after
this
giles
became
a
force
he
shall
now
speak
for
himself
finding
margaret
unable
to
believe
the
good
news
and
sceptical
as
to
the
affairs
of
holy
church
being
administered
by
dwarfs
he
narrated
as
follows
when
the
princess
sent
for
me
to
her
bedroom
as
of
custom
to
keep
her
out
of
languor
i
came
not
mirthful
nor
full
of
country
dicts
as
is
my
wont
but
dull
as
lead
what
aileth
thee
quo
she
sick
heart
quo
i
he
is
in
love
quo
she
whereat
five
brazen
hussies
which
they
call
them
maids
of
honour
did
giggle
loud
so
mad
as
that
said
i
what
i
see
at
court
of
women
folk
ladies
quo
the
princess
let
him
a
be
is
a
liberal
mannikin
and
still
giveth
more
than
he
taketh
of
saucy
words
all
sadness
quo
she
is
the
matter
i
told
her
i
was
meditating
and
what
perplexed
me
was
that
other
folk
could
now
and
then
keep
their
word
but
princes
never
says
she
shafts
fly
high
this
morn
i
told
her
for
they
hit
the
truth
she
said
i
was
as
keen
as
keen
but
it
became
not
me
to
put
riddles
to
her
nor
her
to
answer
them
aloof
a
bit
mesdames
said
she
thou
speak
withouten
fear
for
she
saw
i
was
in
sad
earnest
i
began
to
quake
a
bit
for
mind
ye
she
can
doff
freedom
and
don
dignity
quicker
than
she
can
slip
out
of
her
into
kirtle
of
state
but
i
made
my
voice
so
soft
as
honey
wherefore
smilest
and
i
said
one
evening
a
matter
of
five
years
agone
as
ye
sat
with
your
mother
the
countess
of
charolois
who
is
now
in
heaven
worse
luck
you
wi
your
lute
and
she
wi
her
tapestry
or
the
like
do
ye
mind
there
came
came
into
ye
a
fair
youth
with
a
letter
from
a
painter
body
one
margaret
van
eyck
she
said
she
thought
she
did
it
not
a
tall
youth
exceeding
comely
madam
said
i
was
my
brother
brother
said
she
and
did
eye
me
like
all
over
what
dost
smile
at
so
i
told
her
all
that
passed
between
her
and
gerard
and
how
she
was
for
giving
him
a
bishopric
but
the
good
countess
said
marie
he
is
too
young
and
with
that
they
did
both
promise
him
a
living
said
i
hath
been
a
priest
a
long
while
and
no
living
hence
my
bile
said
she
not
by
my
good
will
for
all
this
thou
hast
said
is
sooth
and
more
i
do
remember
my
dear
mother
said
to
me
see
thou
to
it
if
i
be
not
so
then
she
cried
out
dear
mother
no
word
of
thine
shall
ever
fall
to
the
ground
i
seeing
her
so
ripe
said
quickly
the
vicar
of
gouda
died
last
week
for
when
ye
seek
favours
of
the
great
behoves
ye
know
the
very
thing
ye
aim
at
thy
brother
is
vicar
of
gouda
quo
she
sure
as
i
am
heiress
of
burgundy
and
the
netherlands
nay
thank
me
not
good
giles
quo
she
my
good
mother
and
i
do
thank
thee
for
giving
of
me
somewhat
to
do
for
her
memory
and
does
she
fall
a
weeping
for
her
mother
and
does
that
set
me
off
for
my
good
brother
that
i
love
so
dear
and
to
think
that
a
poor
little
elf
like
me
could
yet
speak
in
the
ear
of
princes
and
make
my
beautiful
brother
vicar
of
gouda
eh
lass
it
is
a
bonny
place
and
a
bonny
manse
and
hawthorn
in
every
bush
at
and
and
eglantine
in
every
summer
hedge
i
know
what
the
poor
fool
affects
leave
that
to
the
dwarf
began
his
narrative
strutting
to
and
fro
before
margaret
but
he
ended
it
in
her
arms
for
she
could
not
contain
herself
but
caught
him
and
embraced
him
warmly
oh
giles
she
said
blushing
and
kissing
him
i
can
not
keep
my
hands
off
thee
thy
body
it
is
so
little
and
thy
heart
so
great
thou
art
his
true
friend
bless
thee
bless
thee
bless
thee
now
we
shall
see
him
again
we
have
not
set
eyes
on
him
since
that
terrible
gramercy
but
that
is
strange
said
giles
maybe
he
is
ashamed
of
having
cursed
those
two
vagabones
being
our
own
flesh
and
blood
worse
think
you
that
is
why
he
hides
said
margaret
eagerly
ay
if
he
is
hiding
at
all
however
i
cry
him
by
bellman
nay
that
might
much
offend
what
care
i
is
gouda
to
go
vicarless
and
the
manse
in
nettles
and
to
margaret
secret
satisfaction
giles
had
the
new
vicar
cried
in
rotterdam
and
the
neighbouring
towns
he
easily
persuaded
margaret
that
in
a
day
or
two
gerard
would
be
sure
to
hear
and
come
to
his
benefice
she
went
to
look
at
his
manse
and
thought
how
comfortable
it
might
be
made
for
him
and
how
dearly
she
should
love
to
do
it
but
the
days
rolled
on
and
gerard
came
neither
to
rotterdam
nor
gouda
giles
was
mortified
margaret
indignant
and
very
wretched
she
said
to
herself
thinking
me
dead
he
comes
home
and
now
because
i
am
alive
he
goes
back
to
italy
for
that
is
where
he
has
joan
advised
her
to
consult
the
hermit
of
gouda
why
sure
he
is
dead
by
this
yon
one
belike
but
the
cave
is
never
long
void
gouda
wants
a
but
margaret
declined
to
go
again
to
gouda
on
such
an
errand
what
can
he
know
shut
up
in
a
cave
less
than
i
belike
gerard
hath
gone
back
t
italy
he
hates
me
for
not
being
presently
a
tergovian
came
in
with
a
word
from
catherine
that
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
had
seen
gerard
later
than
any
one
else
on
this
margaret
determined
to
go
and
see
the
house
and
goods
that
had
been
left
her
and
take
reicht
heynes
home
to
rotterdam
and
as
may
be
supposed
her
steps
took
her
first
to
ghysbrecht
house
she
found
him
in
his
garden
seated
in
a
chair
with
wheels
he
greeted
her
with
a
feeble
voice
but
cordially
and
when
she
asked
him
whether
it
was
true
he
had
seen
gerard
since
the
fifth
of
august
he
replied
gerard
no
more
but
friar
clement
ay
i
saw
him
and
blessed
be
the
day
he
entered
my
he
then
related
in
his
own
words
his
interview
with
clement
he
told
her
moreover
that
the
friar
had
afterwards
acknowledged
he
came
to
tergou
with
the
missing
deed
in
his
bosom
on
purpose
to
make
him
disgorge
her
land
but
that
finding
him
disposed
towards
penitence
he
had
gone
to
work
the
other
way
was
not
this
a
saint
who
came
to
right
thee
but
must
needs
save
his
enemy
soul
in
the
doing
it
to
her
question
whether
he
had
recognized
him
he
said
i
suspected
such
a
thing
was
only
when
he
had
been
three
days
with
me
that
he
revealed
himself
listen
while
i
speak
my
shame
and
his
praise
i
said
to
him
land
is
gone
home
and
my
stomach
feels
lighter
but
there
is
another
fault
that
clingeth
to
me
still
then
told
i
him
of
the
letter
i
had
writ
at
request
of
his
brethren
i
whose
place
it
was
to
check
them
said
i
letter
was
writ
to
part
two
lovers
and
the
devil
aiding
it
hath
done
the
foul
work
land
and
houses
i
can
give
back
but
yon
mischief
is
done
for
ever
quoth
he
for
ever
but
for
life
repent
it
then
while
thou
livest
shall
said
i
how
can
god
forgive
it
i
would
not
said
i
i
he
will
he
certainly
forgive
it
quoth
he
he
is
ten
times
more
forgiving
than
i
am
and
i
forgive
thee
i
stared
at
him
and
then
he
said
softly
but
quavering
like
look
at
me
closer
i
am
gerard
the
son
of
eli
and
i
looked
and
looked
and
at
last
lo
it
was
gerard
verily
i
had
fallen
at
his
feet
with
shame
and
contrition
but
he
would
not
suffer
me
became
not
mine
years
and
his
for
a
particular
fault
i
say
not
i
forgive
thee
without
a
struggle
said
he
being
a
saint
but
these
three
days
thou
hast
spent
in
penitence
i
have
worn
under
thy
roof
in
prayer
and
i
do
forgive
thee
those
were
his
very
margaret
tears
began
to
flow
for
it
was
in
a
broken
and
contrite
voice
the
old
man
told
her
this
unexpected
trait
in
her
gerard
he
continued
and
even
with
that
he
bade
me
farewell
work
here
is
done
now
said
he
i
had
not
the
heart
to
stay
him
for
let
him
forgive
me
ever
so
the
sight
of
me
must
be
wormwood
to
him
he
left
me
in
peace
and
may
a
dying
man
blessing
wait
on
him
go
where
he
will
oh
girl
when
i
think
of
his
wrongs
and
thine
and
how
he
hath
avenged
himself
by
saving
this
stained
soul
of
mine
my
heart
is
broken
with
remorse
and
these
old
eyes
shed
tears
by
night
and
ghysbrecht
said
margaret
weeping
since
he
hath
forgiven
thee
i
forgive
thee
too
what
is
done
is
done
and
thou
hast
let
me
know
this
day
that
which
i
had
walked
the
world
to
hear
but
oh
burgomaster
thou
art
an
understanding
man
now
help
a
poor
woman
which
hath
forgiven
thee
her
she
then
told
him
all
that
had
befallen
and
said
she
they
will
not
keep
the
living
for
him
for
ever
he
bids
fair
to
lose
that
as
well
as
break
all
our
call
my
servant
cried
the
burgomaster
with
sudden
vigour
he
sent
him
for
a
table
and
writing
materials
and
dictated
letters
to
the
burgomasters
in
all
the
principal
towns
in
holland
and
one
to
a
prussian
authority
his
friend
his
clerk
and
margaret
wrote
them
and
he
signed
them
there
said
he
the
matter
shall
be
despatched
throughout
holland
by
trusty
couriers
and
as
far
as
basle
in
switzerland
and
fear
not
but
we
will
soon
have
the
vicar
of
gouda
to
his
she
went
home
animated
with
fresh
hopes
and
accusing
herself
of
ingratitude
to
gerard
i
value
my
wealth
now
said
she
she
also
made
a
resolution
never
to
blame
his
conduct
till
she
should
hear
from
his
own
lips
his
reason
not
long
after
her
return
from
tergou
a
fresh
disaster
befell
catherine
i
must
premise
had
secret
interviews
with
the
black
sheep
the
very
day
after
they
were
expelled
and
cornelis
followed
her
to
tergou
and
lived
there
on
secret
contributions
but
sybrandt
chose
to
remain
in
rotterdam
ere
catherine
left
she
asked
margaret
to
lend
her
two
gold
angels
for
said
she
all
mine
are
margaret
was
delighted
to
lend
them
or
give
them
but
the
words
were
scarce
out
of
her
mouth
ere
she
caught
a
look
of
regret
and
distress
on
kate
face
and
she
saw
directly
whither
her
money
was
going
she
gave
catherine
the
money
and
went
and
shut
herself
up
with
her
boy
now
this
money
was
to
last
sybrandt
till
his
mother
could
make
some
good
excuse
for
visiting
rotterdam
again
and
then
she
would
bring
the
idle
dog
some
of
her
own
industrious
savings
but
sybrandt
having
gold
in
his
pocket
thought
it
inexhaustible
and
being
now
under
no
shadow
of
restraint
led
the
life
of
a
complete
sot
until
one
afternoon
in
a
drunken
frolic
he
climbed
on
the
roof
of
the
stable
at
the
inn
he
was
carousing
in
and
proceeded
to
walk
along
it
a
feat
he
had
performed
many
times
when
sober
but
now
his
unsteady
brain
made
his
legs
unsteady
and
he
rolled
down
the
roof
and
fell
with
a
loud
thwack
on
to
an
horizontal
paling
where
he
hung
a
moment
in
a
semicircle
then
toppled
over
and
lay
silent
on
the
ground
amidst
roars
of
laughter
from
his
boon
companions
when
they
came
to
pick
him
up
he
could
not
stand
but
fell
down
giggling
at
each
attempt
on
this
they
went
staggering
and
roaring
down
the
street
with
him
and
carried
him
at
great
risk
of
another
fall
to
the
shop
in
the
hoog
straet
for
he
had
babbled
his
own
shame
all
over
the
place
as
soon
as
he
saw
margaret
he
hiccupped
out
here
is
the
doctor
that
cures
all
hurts
a
bonny
he
also
bade
her
observe
he
bore
her
no
malice
for
he
was
paying
her
a
visit
sore
against
his
will
wherefore
prithee
send
away
these
drunkards
and
let
you
and
me
have
glass
to
drown
all
all
this
time
margaret
was
pale
and
red
by
turns
at
sight
of
her
enemy
and
at
his
insolence
but
one
of
the
men
whispered
what
had
happened
and
a
streaky
something
in
sybrandt
face
arrested
her
attention
and
he
can
not
stand
up
say
you
a
could
just
now
try
comrade
be
a
man
now
i
am
a
better
man
than
thou
roared
sybrandt
i
stand
up
and
fight
ye
all
for
a
he
started
to
his
feet
and
instantly
rolled
into
his
attendant
arms
with
a
piteous
groan
he
then
began
to
curse
his
boon
companions
and
declare
they
had
stolen
away
his
legs
he
could
feel
nothing
below
the
alas
poor
wretch
said
margaret
she
turned
very
gravely
to
the
men
and
said
leave
him
here
and
if
you
have
brought
him
to
this
go
on
your
knees
for
you
have
spoiled
him
for
life
he
will
never
walk
again
his
back
is
the
drunken
man
caught
these
words
and
the
foolish
look
of
intoxication
fled
and
a
glare
of
anguish
took
its
place
the
curse
he
groaned
the
curse
margaret
and
reicht
heynes
carried
him
carefully
and
laid
him
on
the
softest
bed
i
must
do
as
he
would
do
whispered
margaret
he
was
kind
to
her
opinion
was
verified
sybrandt
spine
was
fatally
injured
and
he
lay
groaning
and
helpless
fed
and
tended
by
her
he
had
so
deeply
injured
the
news
was
sent
to
tergou
and
catherine
came
over
it
was
a
terrible
blow
to
her
moreover
she
accused
herself
as
the
cause
oh
false
wife
oh
weak
mother
she
cried
i
am
rightly
punished
for
my
treason
to
my
poor
she
sat
for
hours
at
a
time
by
his
bedside
rocking
herself
in
silence
and
was
never
quite
herself
again
and
the
first
grey
hairs
began
to
come
in
her
poor
head
from
that
hour
as
for
sybrandt
all
his
cry
was
now
for
gerard
he
used
to
whine
to
margaret
like
a
suffering
hound
oh
sweet
margaret
oh
bonny
margaret
for
our
lady
sake
find
gerard
and
bid
him
take
his
curse
off
me
thou
art
gentle
thou
art
good
thou
wilt
entreat
for
me
and
he
will
refuse
thee
catherine
shared
his
belief
that
gerard
could
cure
him
and
joined
her
entreaties
to
his
margaret
hardly
needed
this
the
burgomaster
and
his
agents
having
failed
she
employed
her
own
and
spent
money
like
water
and
among
these
agents
poor
luke
enrolled
himself
she
met
him
one
day
looking
very
thin
and
spoke
to
him
compassionately
on
this
he
began
to
blubber
and
say
he
was
more
miserable
than
ever
he
would
like
to
be
good
friends
again
upon
almost
any
terms
dear
heart
said
margaret
sorrowfully
why
can
you
not
say
to
yourself
now
i
am
her
little
brother
and
she
is
my
old
married
sister
worn
down
with
care
say
so
and
i
will
indulge
thee
and
pet
thee
and
make
thee
happier
than
a
well
i
will
said
luke
savagely
sooner
than
keep
away
from
you
altogether
but
above
all
give
me
something
to
do
perchance
i
may
have
better
luck
this
get
me
my
marriage
lines
said
margaret
turning
sad
and
gloomy
in
a
moment
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
get
me
him
for
where
they
are
he
not
so
he
may
refuse
to
come
nigh
me
but
certes
he
will
not
deny
a
poor
woman
who
loved
him
once
her
lines
of
betrothal
how
can
she
go
without
them
into
any
honest
man
house
i
get
them
you
if
they
are
in
holland
said
luke
they
are
as
like
to
be
in
rome
replied
margaret
let
us
begin
with
holland
observed
luke
prudently
the
slave
of
love
was
furnished
with
money
by
his
soft
tyrant
and
wandered
hither
and
thither
coopering
and
carpentering
and
looking
for
gerard
i
ca
be
worse
if
i
find
the
vagabone
said
he
and
i
may
be
a
hantle
the
months
rolled
on
and
sybrandt
improved
in
spirit
but
not
in
body
he
was
margaret
pensioner
for
life
and
a
sorrow
fell
upon
poor
catherine
and
left
her
still
more
bowed
down
and
she
lost
her
fine
hearty
bustling
way
and
never
went
about
the
house
singing
now
and
her
nerves
were
shaken
and
she
lived
in
dread
of
some
terrible
misfortune
falling
on
cornelis
the
curse
was
laid
on
him
as
well
as
sybrandt
she
prayed
eli
if
she
had
been
a
faithful
partner
all
these
years
to
take
cornelis
into
his
house
again
and
let
her
live
awhile
at
rotterdam
i
have
good
daughters
here
said
she
but
margaret
is
so
tender
and
thoughtful
and
the
little
gerard
he
is
my
joy
he
grows
liker
his
father
every
day
and
his
prattle
cheers
my
heavy
heart
and
i
do
love
and
eli
sturdy
but
kindly
consented
sorrowfully
and
the
people
of
gouda
petitioned
the
duke
for
a
vicar
a
real
vicar
ours
cometh
never
nigh
us
said
they
this
six
months
past
our
children
they
die
unchristened
and
our
folk
unburied
except
by
some
chance
giles
influence
baffled
this
just
complaint
once
but
a
second
petition
was
prepared
and
he
gave
margaret
little
hope
that
the
present
position
could
be
maintained
a
single
day
so
then
margaret
went
sorrowfully
to
the
pretty
manse
to
see
it
for
the
last
time
ere
it
should
pass
for
ever
into
stranger
hands
i
think
he
would
have
been
happy
here
she
said
and
turned
away
on
their
return
reicht
heynes
proposed
to
her
to
go
and
consult
the
hermit
what
said
margaret
joan
has
been
at
you
she
is
the
one
for
hermits
i
go
if
is
but
to
show
thee
they
know
no
more
than
we
and
they
went
to
the
cave
it
was
an
excavation
partly
natural
partly
artificial
in
a
bank
of
rock
overgrown
by
brambles
there
was
a
rough
stone
door
on
hinges
and
a
little
window
high
up
and
two
apertures
through
one
of
which
the
people
announced
their
gifts
to
the
hermit
and
put
questions
of
all
sorts
to
him
and
when
he
chose
to
answer
his
voice
came
dissonant
and
monstrous
out
at
another
small
aperture
on
the
face
of
the
rock
this
line
was
cut
felix
qui
in
domino
nixus
ab
orbe
fugit
margaret
observed
to
her
companion
that
this
was
new
since
she
was
here
last
ay
said
reicht
like
enough
and
looked
up
at
it
with
awe
writing
even
on
paper
she
thought
no
trifle
but
on
rock
she
whispered
tis
a
far
holier
hermit
than
the
last
he
used
to
come
in
the
town
now
and
then
but
this
one
shows
his
face
to
mortal
and
that
is
holiness
ay
then
what
a
saint
a
dormouse
must
be
out
fie
mistress
would
ye
even
a
beast
to
a
man
come
reicht
said
margaret
my
poor
father
taught
me
overmuch
so
i
will
sit
here
and
look
at
the
manse
once
more
go
thou
forward
and
question
thy
solitary
and
tell
me
whether
ye
get
nought
or
nonsense
out
of
him
for
be
as
reicht
drew
near
the
cave
a
number
of
birds
flew
out
of
she
gave
a
little
scream
and
pointed
to
the
cave
to
show
margaret
they
had
come
thence
on
this
margaret
felt
sure
there
was
no
human
being
in
the
cave
and
gave
the
matter
no
further
attention
she
fell
into
a
deep
reverie
while
looking
at
the
little
manse
she
was
startled
from
it
by
reicht
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
a
faint
voice
saying
let
us
go
you
got
no
answer
at
all
reicht
said
margaret
calmly
no
margaret
said
reicht
despondently
and
they
returned
home
perhaps
after
all
margaret
had
nourished
some
faint
secret
hope
in
her
heart
though
her
reason
had
rejected
it
for
she
certainly
went
home
more
dejectedly
just
as
they
entered
rotterdam
reicht
said
stay
oh
margaret
i
am
ill
at
deceit
but
is
death
to
utter
ill
news
to
thee
i
love
thee
so
speak
out
sweetheart
said
margaret
i
have
gone
through
so
much
i
am
almost
past
feeling
any
fresh
margaret
the
hermit
did
speak
to
what
a
hermit
there
among
all
those
ay
and
doth
not
that
show
him
a
holy
man
i
god
name
what
said
he
to
thee
reicht
alas
margaret
i
told
him
thy
story
and
i
prayed
him
for
our
sake
tell
me
where
thy
gerard
is
and
i
waited
long
for
an
answer
and
presently
a
voice
came
like
a
trumpet
for
the
soul
of
gerard
the
son
of
eli
ah
oh
woe
is
me
that
i
have
this
to
tell
thee
sweet
margaret
bethink
thee
thou
hast
thy
boy
to
live
for
let
me
get
home
said
margaret
faintly
passing
down
the
brede
kirk
straet
they
saw
joan
at
the
door
reicht
said
to
her
eh
woman
she
has
been
to
your
hermit
and
heard
no
good
come
in
said
joan
eager
for
a
gossip
margaret
would
not
go
in
but
she
sat
down
disconsolate
on
the
lowest
step
but
one
of
the
little
external
staircase
that
led
into
house
and
let
the
other
two
gossip
their
fill
at
the
top
of
it
oh
said
joan
what
yon
hermit
says
is
sure
to
be
sooth
he
is
that
holy
i
am
told
that
the
very
birds
consort
with
what
does
that
prove
said
margaret
deprecatingly
i
have
seen
my
gerard
tame
the
birds
in
winter
till
they
would
eat
from
his
a
look
of
pity
at
this
parallel
passed
between
the
other
two
but
they
were
both
too
fond
of
her
to
say
what
they
thought
joan
proceeded
to
relate
all
the
marvellous
tales
she
had
heard
of
this
hermit
sanctity
how
he
never
came
out
but
at
night
and
prayed
among
the
wolves
and
they
never
molested
him
and
now
he
bade
the
people
not
bring
him
so
much
food
to
pamper
his
body
but
to
bring
him
candles
the
candles
are
to
burn
before
his
saint
whispered
reicht
solemnly
ay
lass
and
to
read
his
holy
books
wi
a
neighbour
o
mine
saw
his
hand
come
out
and
the
birds
sat
thereon
and
pecked
crumbs
she
went
for
to
kiss
it
but
the
holy
man
whippit
it
away
in
a
trice
they
abide
a
woman
to
touch
or
even
look
at
saints
what
like
was
his
hand
wife
did
you
ask
her
what
is
my
tongue
for
else
why
dear
heart
all
one
as
yourn
by
the
same
token
a
had
a
thumb
and
four
look
ye
there
but
a
deal
whiter
nor
yourn
and
ay
and
main
what
could
ye
expect
why
a
live
upon
air
and
prayer
and
ah
well
continued
joan
poor
thing
i
whiles
think
is
best
for
her
to
know
the
worst
and
now
she
hath
gotten
a
voice
from
heaven
or
almost
as
good
and
behoves
her
pray
for
his
soul
one
thing
she
is
not
so
poor
now
as
she
was
and
never
fell
riches
to
a
better
hand
and
she
is
only
come
into
her
own
for
that
matter
so
she
can
pay
the
priest
to
say
masses
for
him
and
that
is
a
great
in
the
midst
of
their
gossip
margaret
in
whose
ears
it
was
all
buzzing
though
she
seemed
lost
in
thought
got
softly
up
and
crept
away
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
and
her
brows
bent
she
hath
forgotten
i
am
with
her
said
reicht
heynes
ruefully
she
had
her
gossip
out
with
joan
and
then
went
home
she
found
margaret
seated
cutting
out
a
pelisse
of
grey
cloth
and
a
cape
to
match
little
gerard
was
standing
at
her
side
inside
her
left
arm
eyeing
the
work
and
making
it
more
difficult
by
wriggling
about
and
fingering
the
arm
with
which
she
held
the
cloth
steady
to
all
which
she
submitted
with
imperturbable
patience
and
complacency
fancy
a
male
workman
so
entangled
impeded
worried
ot
that
mammy
a
pelisse
my
ot
a
a
great
frock
and
this
is
the
cape
ot
it
for
to
keep
his
body
from
the
cold
and
the
cape
is
for
his
shoulders
or
to
go
over
his
head
like
the
country
folk
is
for
a
ot
a
a
holy
man
that
lives
in
a
cave
all
by
in
de
dark
ay
in
the
morning
reicht
was
sent
to
the
hermit
with
the
pelisse
and
a
pound
of
thick
candles
as
she
was
going
out
of
the
door
margaret
said
to
her
said
you
whose
son
gerard
was
nay
not
think
girl
how
could
he
call
him
gerard
son
of
eli
if
you
had
not
told
him
reicht
persisted
she
had
never
mentioned
him
but
as
plain
gerard
but
margaret
told
her
flatly
she
did
not
believe
her
at
which
reicht
was
affronted
and
went
out
with
a
little
toss
of
the
head
however
she
determined
to
question
the
hermit
again
and
did
not
doubt
he
would
be
more
liberal
in
his
communication
when
he
saw
his
nice
new
pelisse
and
the
candles
she
had
not
been
gone
long
when
giles
came
in
with
ill
news
the
living
of
gouda
would
be
kept
vacant
no
longer
margaret
was
greatly
distressed
at
this
oh
giles
said
she
ask
for
another
month
they
will
give
thee
another
month
he
returned
in
an
hour
to
tell
her
he
could
not
get
a
month
they
have
given
me
a
week
said
he
and
what
is
a
week
drowning
bodies
catch
at
strawen
was
her
reply
a
week
a
little
week
reicht
came
back
from
her
errand
out
of
spirits
her
oracle
had
declined
all
further
communication
so
at
least
its
obstinate
silence
might
fairly
be
interpreted
the
next
day
margaret
put
reicht
in
charge
of
the
shop
and
disappeared
all
day
so
the
next
day
and
so
the
next
nor
would
she
tell
any
one
where
she
had
been
perhaps
she
was
ashamed
the
fact
is
she
spent
all
those
days
on
one
little
spot
of
ground
when
they
thought
her
dreaming
she
was
applying
to
every
word
that
fell
from
joan
and
reicht
the
whole
powers
of
a
far
acuter
mind
than
either
of
them
possessed
she
went
to
work
on
a
scale
that
never
occurred
to
either
of
them
she
was
determined
to
see
the
hermit
and
question
him
face
to
face
not
through
a
wall
she
found
that
by
making
a
circuit
she
could
get
above
the
cave
and
look
down
without
being
seen
by
the
solitary
but
when
she
came
to
do
it
she
found
an
impenetrable
mass
of
brambles
after
tearing
her
clothes
and
her
hands
and
feet
so
that
she
was
soon
covered
with
blood
the
resolute
patient
girl
took
out
her
scissors
and
steadily
snipped
and
cut
till
she
made
a
narrow
path
through
the
enemy
but
so
slow
was
the
work
that
she
had
to
leave
it
half
done
the
next
day
she
had
her
scissors
fresh
ground
and
brought
a
sharp
knife
as
well
and
gently
silently
cut
her
way
to
the
roof
of
the
cave
there
she
made
an
ambush
of
some
of
the
cut
brambles
so
that
the
might
not
see
her
and
couched
with
watchful
eye
till
the
hermit
should
come
out
she
heard
him
move
underneath
her
but
he
never
left
his
cell
she
began
to
think
it
was
true
that
he
only
came
out
at
night
the
next
day
she
came
early
and
brought
a
jerkin
she
was
making
for
little
gerard
and
there
she
sat
all
day
working
and
watching
with
dogged
patience
at
four
the
birds
began
to
feed
and
a
great
many
of
the
smaller
kinds
came
fluttering
round
the
cave
and
one
or
two
went
in
but
most
of
them
taking
a
preliminary
seat
on
the
bushes
suddenly
discovered
margaret
and
went
off
with
an
agitated
flirt
of
their
little
wings
and
although
they
sailed
about
in
the
air
they
would
not
enter
the
cave
presently
to
encourage
them
the
hermit
all
unconscious
of
the
cause
of
their
tremors
put
out
a
thin
white
hand
with
a
few
crumbs
in
it
margaret
laid
down
her
work
softly
and
gliding
her
body
forward
like
a
snake
looked
down
at
it
from
above
it
was
but
a
few
feet
from
her
it
was
as
the
woman
described
it
a
thin
white
hand
presently
the
other
hand
came
out
with
a
piece
of
bread
and
the
two
hands
together
broke
it
and
scattered
the
crumbs
but
that
other
hand
had
hardly
been
out
two
seconds
ere
the
violet
eyes
that
were
watching
above
dilated
and
the
gentle
bosom
heaved
and
the
whole
frame
quivered
like
a
leaf
in
the
wind
what
her
swift
eye
had
seen
i
leave
the
reader
to
guess
she
suppressed
the
scream
that
rose
to
her
lips
but
the
effort
cost
her
dear
soon
the
left
hand
of
the
hermit
began
to
swim
indistinctly
before
her
gloating
eyes
and
with
a
deep
sigh
her
head
drooped
and
she
lay
like
a
broken
lily
she
was
in
a
deep
swoon
to
which
perhaps
her
long
fast
and
the
agitation
and
sleeplessness
of
many
preceding
days
contributed
and
there
lay
beauty
intelligence
and
constancy
pale
and
silent
and
little
that
hermit
guessed
who
was
so
near
him
the
little
birds
hopped
on
her
now
and
one
nearly
entangled
his
little
feet
in
her
rich
auburn
hair
she
came
back
to
her
troubles
the
sun
was
set
she
was
very
cold
she
cried
a
little
but
i
think
it
was
partly
from
the
remains
of
physical
weakness
and
then
she
went
home
praying
god
and
the
saints
to
enlighten
her
and
teach
her
what
to
do
for
the
best
when
she
got
home
she
was
pale
and
hysterical
and
would
say
nothing
in
answer
to
all
their
questions
but
her
favourite
word
we
are
wading
in
deep
the
night
seemed
to
have
done
wonders
for
her
she
came
to
catherine
who
was
sitting
sighing
by
the
fireside
and
kissed
her
and
said
mother
what
would
you
like
best
in
the
world
eh
dear
replied
catherine
despondently
i
know
nought
that
would
make
me
smile
now
i
have
parted
from
too
many
that
were
dear
to
me
gerard
lost
again
as
soon
as
found
kate
in
heaven
and
sybrandt
down
for
poor
mother
mother
dear
gouda
manse
is
to
be
furnished
and
cleaned
and
made
ready
all
in
a
hurry
see
here
be
ten
gold
angels
make
them
go
far
good
mother
for
i
have
over
many
already
from
my
boy
for
a
set
of
useless
loons
that
were
aye
going
to
find
him
for
catherine
and
reicht
stared
at
her
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
out
burst
a
flood
of
questions
to
none
of
which
would
she
give
a
reply
nay
said
she
i
have
lain
on
my
bed
and
thought
and
thought
and
thought
whiles
you
were
all
sleeping
and
methinks
i
have
got
the
clue
to
all
i
love
you
dear
mother
but
i
trust
no
woman
tongue
if
i
fail
this
time
i
have
none
to
blame
but
margaret
a
resolute
woman
is
a
very
resolute
thing
and
there
was
a
deep
dogged
determination
in
margaret
voice
and
brow
that
at
once
convinced
catherine
it
would
be
idle
to
put
any
more
questions
at
that
time
she
and
reicht
lost
themselves
in
conjectures
and
catherine
whispered
reicht
bide
quiet
then
leak
out
a
shrewd
piece
of
advice
founded
on
general
observation
within
an
hour
catherine
was
on
the
road
to
gouda
in
a
cart
with
two
stout
girls
to
help
her
and
quite
a
siege
artillery
of
mops
and
pails
and
brushes
she
came
back
with
heightened
colour
and
something
of
the
old
sparkle
in
her
eye
and
kissed
margaret
with
a
silent
warmth
that
spoke
volumes
and
at
five
in
the
morning
was
off
again
to
gouda
that
night
as
reicht
was
in
her
first
sleep
a
hand
gently
pressed
her
shoulder
and
she
awoke
and
was
going
to
scream
whisht
said
margaret
and
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
she
then
whispered
rise
softly
don
thy
habits
and
come
with
me
when
she
came
down
margaret
begged
her
to
loose
dragon
and
bring
him
along
now
dragon
was
a
great
mastiff
who
had
guarded
margaret
van
eyck
and
reicht
two
lone
women
for
some
years
and
was
devotedly
attached
to
the
latter
margaret
and
reicht
went
out
with
dragon
walking
majestically
behind
them
they
came
back
long
after
midnight
and
retired
to
rest
catherine
never
knew
margaret
read
her
friends
she
saw
the
sturdy
faithful
frisian
could
hold
her
tongue
and
catherine
could
not
yet
i
am
not
sure
she
would
have
trusted
even
reicht
had
her
nerve
equalled
her
spirit
but
with
all
her
daring
and
resolution
she
was
a
tender
timid
woman
a
little
afraid
of
the
dark
very
afraid
of
being
alone
in
it
and
desperately
afraid
of
wolves
now
dragon
could
kill
a
wolf
in
a
brace
of
shakes
but
then
dragon
would
not
go
with
her
but
only
with
reicht
so
altogether
she
made
one
confidante
the
next
night
they
made
another
moonlight
reconnaissance
and
as
i
think
with
some
result
for
not
the
next
night
it
rained
that
night
and
extinguished
their
courage
but
the
next
after
they
took
with
them
a
companion
the
last
in
the
world
reicht
heynes
would
have
thought
of
yet
she
gave
her
warm
approval
as
soon
as
she
was
told
he
was
to
go
with
them
imagine
how
these
stealthy
assailants
trembled
and
panted
when
the
moment
of
action
came
imagine
if
you
can
the
tumult
in
breast
the
thrilling
hopes
chasing
and
chased
by
sickening
fears
the
strange
and
perhaps
unparalleled
mixture
of
tender
familiarity
and
distant
awe
with
which
a
lovely
and
but
tender
adoring
woman
wife
in
the
eye
of
the
law
and
no
wife
in
the
eye
of
the
church
trembling
blushing
paling
glowing
shivering
stole
at
night
noiseless
as
the
dew
upon
the
hermit
of
gouda
and
the
stars
above
seemed
never
so
bright
and
calm
chapter
xcii
yes
the
hermit
of
gouda
was
the
vicar
of
gouda
and
knew
it
not
so
absolute
was
his
seclusion
my
reader
is
aware
that
the
moment
the
frenzy
of
his
passion
passed
he
was
seized
with
remorse
for
having
been
betrayed
into
it
but
perhaps
only
those
who
have
risen
as
high
in
religious
spirit
as
he
had
and
suddenly
fallen
can
realize
the
terror
at
himself
that
took
possession
of
him
he
felt
like
one
whom
had
betrayed
to
the
very
edge
of
a
precipice
ah
good
jerome
he
cried
how
much
better
you
knew
me
than
i
knew
myself
how
bitter
yet
wholesome
was
your
admonition
accustomed
to
search
his
own
heart
he
saw
at
once
that
the
true
cause
of
his
fury
was
margaret
i
love
her
then
better
than
god
said
he
despairingly
better
than
the
church
from
such
a
love
what
can
spring
to
me
or
to
her
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
let
the
strong
battle
temptation
is
for
the
weak
to
flee
and
who
is
weaker
than
i
have
shown
myself
what
is
my
penitence
my
religion
a
pack
of
cards
built
by
degrees
into
a
structure
and
lo
one
breath
of
earthly
love
and
it
lies
in
the
dust
i
must
begin
again
and
on
a
surer
he
resolved
to
leave
holland
at
once
and
spend
years
of
his
life
in
some
distant
convent
before
returning
to
it
by
that
time
the
temptations
of
earthly
passion
would
be
doubly
baffled
and
older
and
a
better
monk
he
should
be
more
master
of
his
earthly
affections
and
margaret
seeing
herself
abandoned
would
marry
and
love
another
the
very
anguish
this
last
thought
cost
him
showed
the
and
that
he
was
on
the
path
of
religious
duty
but
in
leaving
her
for
his
immortal
good
and
hers
he
was
not
to
neglect
her
temporal
weal
indeed
the
sweet
thought
he
could
make
her
comfortable
for
life
and
rich
in
this
world
goods
which
she
was
not
bound
to
despise
sustained
him
in
the
bitter
struggle
it
cost
him
to
turn
his
back
on
her
without
one
kind
word
or
look
oh
what
will
she
think
of
me
he
groaned
shall
i
not
seem
to
her
of
all
creatures
the
most
heartless
inhuman
but
so
best
ay
better
she
should
hate
me
miserable
that
i
am
heaven
is
merciful
and
giveth
my
broken
heart
this
comfort
i
can
make
that
villain
restore
her
own
and
she
shall
never
lose
another
true
lover
by
poverty
another
ah
me
ah
me
god
and
the
saints
to
mine
aid
how
he
fared
on
this
errand
has
been
related
but
first
as
you
may
perhaps
remember
he
went
at
night
to
shrive
the
hermit
of
gouda
he
found
him
dying
and
never
left
him
till
he
had
closed
his
eyes
and
buried
him
beneath
the
floor
of
the
little
oratory
attached
to
his
cell
it
was
the
peaceful
end
of
a
stormy
life
the
hermit
had
been
a
soldier
and
even
now
carried
a
steel
corselet
next
his
skin
saying
he
was
now
christ
soldier
as
he
had
been
satan
when
clement
had
shriven
him
and
prayed
by
him
he
in
his
turn
sought
counsel
of
one
who
was
dying
in
so
pious
a
frame
the
hermit
advised
him
to
be
his
successor
in
this
peaceful
retreat
his
had
been
a
hard
fight
against
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
and
he
had
never
thoroughly
baffled
them
till
he
retired
into
the
citadel
of
these
words
and
the
hermit
pious
and
peaceful
death
which
speedily
followed
and
set
as
it
were
the
seal
of
immortal
truth
on
them
made
a
deep
impression
upon
clement
nor
in
his
case
had
they
any
prejudice
to
combat
the
solitary
recluse
was
still
profoundly
revered
in
the
church
whether
immured
as
an
anchorite
or
anchoress
in
some
cave
or
cell
belonging
to
a
monastery
or
hidden
in
the
more
savage
but
laxer
seclusion
of
the
independent
hermitage
and
clement
knew
more
about
the
hermits
of
the
church
than
most
divines
at
his
time
of
life
he
had
read
much
thereon
at
the
monastery
near
tergou
had
devoured
their
lives
with
wonder
and
delight
in
the
manuscripts
of
the
vatican
and
conversed
earnestly
about
them
with
the
mendicant
friars
of
several
nations
before
printing
these
friars
were
the
great
circulators
of
those
local
annals
and
biographies
which
accumulated
in
the
convents
of
every
land
then
his
teacher
jerome
had
been
three
years
an
anchorite
on
the
heights
of
camaldoli
where
for
more
than
four
centuries
the
thebaid
had
been
revived
and
jerome
cold
and
curt
on
most
religious
themes
was
warm
with
enthusiasm
on
this
one
he
had
pored
over
the
annals
of
john
baptist
abbey
round
about
which
the
hermit
caves
were
scattered
and
told
him
the
names
of
many
a
noble
and
many
a
famous
warrior
who
had
ended
his
days
there
a
hermit
and
of
many
a
bishop
and
archbishop
who
had
passed
from
the
see
to
the
hermitage
or
from
the
hermitage
to
the
see
among
the
former
the
archbishop
of
ravenna
among
the
latter
pope
victor
the
ninth
he
told
him
too
with
grim
delight
of
their
multifarious
austerities
and
how
each
hermit
set
himself
to
find
where
he
was
weakest
and
attacked
himself
without
mercy
or
remission
till
there
even
there
he
was
strongest
and
how
seven
times
in
the
hours
in
thunder
rain
or
snow
by
daylight
twilight
moonlight
or
torchlight
the
solitaries
flocked
from
distant
points
over
rugged
precipitous
ways
to
worship
in
the
convent
church
at
matins
at
prime
tierce
sexte
nones
vespers
and
compline
he
even
under
eager
questioning
described
to
him
the
persons
of
famous
anchorites
he
had
sung
the
psalter
and
prayed
with
there
the
only
intercourse
their
vows
allowed
except
with
special
permission
moncata
duke
of
moncata
and
cardova
and
hidalgo
of
spain
who
in
the
flower
of
his
youth
had
retired
thither
from
the
pomps
vanities
and
pleasures
of
the
world
father
john
baptist
of
novara
who
had
led
armies
to
battle
but
was
now
a
private
soldier
of
christ
cornelius
samuel
and
sylvanus
this
last
when
the
great
duchess
de
medici
obtained
the
pope
leave
hitherto
refused
to
visit
camaldoli
went
down
and
met
her
at
the
first
wooden
cross
and
there
surrounded
as
she
was
with
courtiers
and
flatterers
remonstrated
with
her
and
persuaded
her
and
warned
her
not
to
profane
that
holy
mountain
where
no
woman
for
so
many
centuries
had
placed
her
foot
and
she
awed
by
the
place
and
the
man
retreated
with
all
her
captains
soldiers
courtiers
and
pages
from
that
one
hoary
hermit
at
basle
clement
found
fresh
materials
especially
with
respect
to
german
and
english
anchorites
and
he
had
even
prepared
a
catena
eremitarum
from
the
year
of
our
lord
when
paul
of
thebes
commenced
his
ninety
years
of
solitude
down
to
the
year
he
called
them
angelorum
amici
et
animalium
friends
of
angels
and
animals
thus
though
in
those
days
he
never
thought
to
be
a
recluse
the
road
was
paved
so
to
speak
and
when
the
dying
hermit
of
gouda
blessed
the
citadel
of
solitude
where
he
had
fought
the
good
fight
and
won
it
and
invited
him
to
take
up
the
of
faith
that
now
fell
off
his
own
shrunken
body
clement
said
within
himself
heaven
itself
led
my
foot
hither
to
this
it
struck
him
too
as
no
small
coincidence
that
his
patron
bavon
was
a
hermit
and
an
austere
one
a
cuirassier
of
the
solitary
cell
as
soon
as
he
was
reconciled
to
ghysbrecht
van
swieten
he
went
eagerly
to
his
abode
praying
heaven
it
might
not
have
been
already
occupied
in
these
three
days
the
fear
was
not
vain
these
famous
dens
never
wanted
a
human
tenant
long
he
found
the
rude
stone
door
ajar
then
he
made
sure
he
was
too
late
he
opened
the
door
and
went
softly
in
no
the
cell
was
vacant
and
there
were
the
hermit
great
ivory
crucifix
his
pens
ink
seeds
and
memento
mori
a
skull
his
cilice
of
hair
and
another
of
bristles
his
sheepskin
pelisse
and
hood
his
hammer
chisel
and
psaltery
etc
men
and
women
had
passed
that
way
but
none
had
ventured
to
intrude
far
less
to
steal
faith
and
simplicity
had
guarded
that
keyless
door
more
securely
than
the
houses
of
the
laity
were
defended
by
their
gates
like
a
modern
gaol
and
think
iron
bars
at
every
window
and
the
gentry
by
moat
bastion
chevaux
de
frise
and
portcullis
as
soon
as
clement
was
fairly
in
the
cell
there
was
a
loud
flap
and
a
flutter
and
down
came
a
great
brown
owl
from
a
corner
and
whirled
out
of
the
window
driving
the
air
cold
on
clement
face
he
started
and
shuddered
was
this
seeming
owl
something
diabolical
trying
to
deter
him
from
his
soul
good
on
second
thoughts
might
it
not
be
some
good
spirit
the
hermit
had
employed
to
keep
the
cell
for
him
perhaps
the
hermit
himself
finally
he
concluded
that
it
was
just
an
owl
and
that
he
would
try
and
make
friends
with
it
he
kneeled
down
and
inaugurated
his
new
life
with
prayer
clement
had
not
only
an
earthly
passion
to
quell
the
power
of
which
made
him
tremble
for
his
eternal
weal
but
he
had
a
penance
to
do
for
having
given
way
to
ire
his
besetting
sin
and
cursed
his
own
brothers
he
looked
round
this
roomy
cell
furnished
with
so
many
comforts
and
compared
it
with
the
pictures
in
his
mind
of
the
hideous
place
eremus
in
eremo
a
desert
in
a
desert
where
holy
jerome
hermit
and
the
plutarch
of
hermits
had
wrestled
with
sickness
temptation
and
despair
four
mortal
years
and
with
the
inaccessible
and
thorny
niche
a
hole
in
a
precipice
where
the
boy
hermit
benedict
buried
himself
and
lived
three
years
on
the
pittance
the
good
monk
romanus
could
spare
him
from
his
scanty
commons
and
subdivided
that
mouthful
with
his
friend
a
raven
and
the
hollow
tree
of
his
patron
bavon
and
the
earthly
purgatory
at
fribourg
where
lived
a
nameless
saint
in
a
horrid
cavern
his
eyes
chilled
with
perpetual
gloom
and
his
ears
stunned
with
an
eternal
waterfall
and
the
pillar
on
which
simeon
stylita
existed
years
and
the
destina
or
stone
box
of
dunstan
where
like
hilarion
in
his
bulrush
hive
sepulchro
potius
quam
domu
he
could
scarce
sit
stand
or
lie
and
the
living
tombs
sealed
with
lead
of
thais
and
christina
and
other
recluses
and
the
damp
dungeon
of
alred
these
and
scores
more
of
the
dismal
dens
in
which
true
hermits
had
worn
out
their
wasted
bodies
on
the
rock
and
the
rock
under
their
sleeping
bodies
and
their
praying
knees
all
came
into
his
mind
and
he
said
to
himself
this
sweet
retreat
is
for
safety
of
the
soul
but
what
for
penance
jesu
aid
me
against
faults
to
come
and
for
the
fault
i
rue
face
of
man
i
will
not
see
for
a
twelvemonth
and
a
he
had
famous
precedents
in
his
eye
even
for
this
last
and
unusual
severity
in
fact
the
original
hermit
of
this
very
cell
was
clearly
under
the
same
vow
hence
the
two
apertures
through
which
he
was
spoken
to
and
replied
adopting
in
other
respects
the
uniform
rule
of
hermits
and
anchorites
he
divided
his
day
into
the
seven
offices
ignoring
the
petty
accidents
of
light
and
dark
creations
both
of
him
to
whom
he
prayed
so
unceasingly
he
learned
the
psalter
by
heart
and
in
all
the
intervals
of
devotion
not
occupied
by
broken
slumbers
he
worked
hard
with
his
hands
no
article
of
the
hermit
rule
was
more
strict
or
more
ancient
than
this
and
here
his
penance
embarrassed
him
for
what
work
could
he
do
without
being
seen
that
should
benefit
his
neighbours
for
the
hermit
was
to
labour
for
himself
in
those
cases
only
where
his
subsistence
depended
on
it
now
clement
modest
needs
were
amply
supplied
by
the
villagers
on
moonlight
nights
he
would
steal
out
like
a
thief
and
dig
some
poor
man
garden
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
he
made
baskets
and
dropped
them
slily
at
humble
doors
and
since
he
could
do
nothing
for
the
bodies
of
those
who
passed
by
his
cell
in
daytime
he
went
out
in
the
dead
of
the
night
with
his
hammer
and
his
chisel
and
carved
moral
and
religious
sentences
all
down
the
road
upon
the
sandstone
rocks
who
knows
said
he
often
a
chance
shaft
strikes
oh
sore
heart
comfort
thou
the
poor
and
bereaved
with
holy
words
of
solace
in
their
native
tongue
for
he
said
well
is
ad
corda
plebis
also
he
remembered
the
learned
colonna
had
told
him
of
the
written
mountains
in
the
east
where
kings
had
inscribed
their
victories
what
said
clement
are
they
so
wise
those
eastern
monarchs
to
engrave
their
glory
upon
the
rock
making
a
blood
bubble
endure
so
long
as
earth
and
shall
i
leave
the
rocks
about
me
silent
on
the
king
of
glory
at
whose
word
they
were
and
at
whose
breath
they
shall
be
dust
nay
but
these
stones
shall
speak
to
weary
wayfarers
of
eternal
peace
and
of
the
lamb
whose
frail
and
afflicted
yet
happy
servant
worketh
them
now
at
this
time
the
inspired
words
that
have
consoled
the
poor
and
the
afflicted
for
so
many
ages
were
not
yet
printed
in
dutch
so
that
these
sentences
of
gold
from
the
holy
evangelists
came
like
fresh
oracles
from
heaven
or
like
the
dew
on
parched
flowers
and
the
poor
written
rocks
softened
a
heart
or
two
and
sent
the
heavy
laden
singing
on
their
way
these
holy
oracles
that
seemed
to
spring
up
around
him
like
magic
his
prudent
answers
through
his
window
to
such
as
sought
ghostly
counsel
and
above
all
his
invisibility
soon
gained
him
a
prodigious
reputation
this
was
not
diminished
by
the
medical
advice
they
now
and
then
extorted
from
him
sore
against
his
will
by
tears
and
entreaties
for
if
the
patients
got
well
they
gave
the
holy
hermit
the
credit
and
if
not
they
laid
all
the
blame
on
the
devil
i
think
he
killed
nobody
for
his
remedies
were
womanish
and
sage
and
wormwood
sion
hyssop
borage
spikenard
our

feverfew
and

and
all
in
small
quantities
except
the
last

his
abstinence
sure
sign
of
a
saint
the
eggs
and
milk
they
brought
him
at
first
he
refused
with
horror
know
ye
not
the
rule
is
bread
or
herbs
and
water
eggs
they
are
birds
in
disguise
for
when
the
bird
dieth
then
the
egg
rotteth
as
for
milk
it
is
little
better
than
white
blood
and
when
they
brought
him
too
much
bread
he
refused
it
then
they
used
to
press
it
on
him
nay
holy
father
give
the
overplus
to
the
you
who
go
among

poor

do

his
clement
had
one
advantage
over
her
whose
image
in
his
heart
he
was
bent
on
destroying
he
had
suffered
and
survived
the
pang
of
bereavement
and
the
mind
can
not
quite
repeat
such
anguish
then
he
had
built
up
a
habit
of
looking
on
her
as
dead
after
that
strange
scene
in
the
church
and
churchyard
of
laurens
that
habit
might
be
compared
to
a
structure
riven
by
a
thunderbolt
it
was
shattered
but
stones
enough
stood
to
found
a
similar
habit
on
to
look
on
her
as
dead
to
him
and
by
severe
subdivision
of
his
time
and
thoughts
by
unceasing
prayers
and
manual
labour
he
did
in
about
three
months
succeed
in
benumbing
the
earthly
half
of
his
heart
but
lo
within
a
day
or
two
of
this
first
symptom
of
mental
peace
returning
slowly
there
descended
upon
his
mind
a
horrible
despondency
words
can
not
utter
it
for
words
never
yet
painted
a
likeness
of
despair
voices
seemed
to
whisper
in
his
ear
kill
thyself
kill
kill
kill
and
he
longed
to
obey
the
voices
for
life
was
intolerable
he
wrestled
with
his
dark
enemy
with
prayers
and
tears
he
prayed
god
but
to
vary
his
temptation
oh
let
mine
enemy
have
power
to
scourge
me
with
whips
to
tear
me
leagues
and
leagues
over
rugged
places
by
the
hair
of
my
head
as
he
has
served
many
a
holy
hermit
that
yet
baffled
him
at
last
to
fly
on
me
like
a
raging
lion
to
gnaw
me
with
a
serpent
fangs
any
pain
any
terror
but
this
horrible
gloom
of
the
soul
that
shuts
me
from
all
light
of
thee
and
of
the
and
now
a
freezing
thought
crossed
him
what
if
the
triumphs
of
the
powers
of
darkness
over
christian
souls
in
desert
places
had
been
suppressed
and
only
their
defeats
recorded
or
at
least
in
full
for
dark
hints
were
scattered
about
antiquity
that
now
first
began
to
grin
at
him
with
terrible
meaning
they
wandered
in
the
desert
and
perished
by
serpents
said
an
ancient
father
of
hermits
that
went
into
solitude
and
were
seen
no
and
another
at
a
more
recent
epoch
wrote
vertuntur
ad
melancholiam
they
turn
to
gloomy
these
two
statements
were
they
not
one
for
the
ancient
fathers
never
spoke
with
regret
of
the
death
of
the
body
no
the
hermits
so
lost
were
perished
souls
and
the
serpents
were
diabolical
thoughts
the
natural
brood
of
solitude
jerome
went
into
the
desert
with
three
companions
one
fled
in
the
first
year
two
died
how
the
single
one
that
lasted
was
a
gigantic
soul
with
an
iron
body
the
cotemporary
who
related
this
made
no
comment
expressed
no
wonder
what
then
if
here
was
a
glimpse
of
the
true
proportion
in
every
age
and
many
souls
had
always
been
lost
in
solitude
for
one
gigantic
mind
and
iron
body
that
survived
this
terrible
ordeal
the
darkened
recluse
now
cast
his
despairing
eyes
over
antiquity
to
see
what
weapons
the
christian
arsenal
contained
that
might
befriend
him
the
greatest
of
all
was
prayer
alas
it
was
a
part
of
his
malady
to
be
unable
to
pray
with
true
fervour
the
very
system
of
mechanical
supplication
he
had
for
months
carried
out
so
severely
by
rule
had
rather
checked
than
fostered
his
power
of
originating
true
prayer
he
prayed
louder
than
ever
but
the
heart
hung
back
cold
and
gloomy
and
let
the
words
go
up
alone
poor
wingless
prayers
he
cried
you
will
not
get
to
a
fiend
of
this
complexion
had
been
driven
out
of
king
saul
by
music
clement
took
up
the
hermit
psaltery
and
with
much
trouble
mended
the
strings
and
tuned
it
no
he
could
not
play
it
his
soul
was
so
out
of
tune
the
sounds
jarred
on
it
and
made
him
almost
mad
ah
wretched
me
he
cried
saul
had
a
saint
to
play
to
him
he
was
not
alone
with
the
spirits
of
darkness
but
here
is
no
sweet
bard
of
israel
to
play
to
me
i
lonely
with
crushed
heart
on
which
a
black
fiend
sitteth
mountain
high
must
make
the
music
to
uplift
that
heart
to
heaven
it
may
not
and
he
grovelled
on
the
earth
weeping
and
tearing
his
hair
vertebatur
ad
melancholiam
it
requires
nowadays
a
strong
effort
of
the
imagination
to
realize
the
effect
on
poor
people
who
had
never
seen
them
before
of
such
sentences
as
this
blessed
are
the
poor
etc
the
primitive
writer
was
so
interpreted
by
others
besides
clement
and
in
particular
by
peter
of
blois
a
divine
of
the
twelfth
century
whose
comment
is
noteworthy
as
he
himself
was
a
hermit
chapter
xciii
one
day
as
he
lay
there
sighing
and
groaning
prayerless
tuneless
hopeless
a
thought
flashed
into
his
mind
what
he
had
done
for
the
poor
and
the
wayfarer
he
would
do
for
himself
he
would
fill
his
den
of
despair
with
the
name
of
god
and
the
magic
words
of
holy
writ
and
the
pious
prayerful
consolations
of
the
church
then
like
christian
at
apollyon
feet
he
reached
his
hand
suddenly
out
and
caught
not
his
sword
for
he
had
none
but
peaceful
humbler
weapon
his
chisel
and
worked
with
it
as
if
his
soul
depended
on
his
arm
they
say
that
michael
angelo
in
the
next
generation
used
to
carve
statues
not
like
our
timid
sculptors
by
modelling
the
work
in
clay
and
then
setting
a
mechanic
to
chisel
it
but
would
seize
the
block
conceive
the
image
and
at
once
with
mallet
and
steel
make
the
marble
chips
fly
like
mad
about
him
and
the
mass
sprout
into
form
even
so
clement
drew
no
lines
to
guide
his
hand
he
went
to
his
memory
for
the
gracious
words
and
then
dashed
at
his
work
and
eagerly
graved
them
in
the
soft
stone
between
working
and
fighting
he
begged
his
visitors
for
candle
ends
and
rancid
oil
anything
is
good
enough
for
me
he
said
if
but
so
at
night
the
cave
glowed
afar
off
like
a
blacksmith
forge
through
the
window
and
the
gaping
chinks
of
the
rude
stone
door
and
the
rustics
beholding
crossed
themselves
and
suspected
deviltries
and
within
the
holy
talismans
one
after
another
came
upon
the
walls
and
the
sparks
and
the
chips
flew
day
and
night
night
and
day
as
the
soldier
of
solitude
and
of
the
church
plied
with
sighs
and
groans
his
bloodless

he
may
be
wholly
nailed
to
thy
heart
who
for
thee
was
all
nailed
unto
the
cross
for
do
but
call
to
mind
the
sufferings
of
christ
and
there
is
nought
on
earth
too
hard
to
endure
with
composure
soothed
a
little
a
very
little
by
the
sweet
and
pious
words
he
was
raising
all
round
him
and
weighed
down
with
watching
and
working
night
and
day
clement
one
morning
sank
prostrate
with
fatigue
and
a
deep
sleep
overpowered
him
for
many
hours
awaking
quietly
he
heard
a
little
cheep
he
opened
his
eyes
and
lo
upon
his
breviary
which
was
on
a
low
stool
near
his
feet
ruffling
all
his
feathers
with
a
single
pull
and
smoothing
them
as
suddenly
and
cocking
his
bill
this
way
and
that
with
a
vast
display
of
cunning
purely
imaginary
perched
a
robin
redbreast
clement
held
his
breath
he
half
closed
his
eyes
lest
they
should
frighten
the
airy
guest
down
came
robin
on
the
floor
when
there
he
went
through
his
pantomime
of
astuteness
and
then
pim
pim
pim
with
three
stiff
little
hops
like
a
ball
of
worsted
on
vertical
wires
he
was
on
the
hermit
bare
foot
on
this
eminence
he
swelled
and
contracted
again
with
ebb
and
flow
of
feathers
but
clement
lost
this
for
he
quite
closed
his
eyes
and
scarce
drew
his
breath
in
fear
of
frightening
and
losing
his
visitor
he
was
content
to
feel
the
minute
claw
on
his
foot
he
could
but
just
feel
it
and
that
by
help
of
knowing
it
was
there
presently
a
little
flirt
with
two
little
wings
and
the
feathered
busybody
was
on
the
breviary
again
then
clement
determined
to
try
and
feed
this
pretty
little
fidget
without
frightening
it
away
but
it
was
very
difficult
he
had
a
piece
of
bread
within
reach
but
how
get
at
it
i
think
he
was
five
minutes
creeping
his
hand
up
to
that
bread
and
when
there
he
must
not
move
his
arm
he
slily
got
a
crumb
between
a
finger
and
thumb
and
shot
it
as
boys
do
marbles
keeping
the
hand
quite
still
cockrobin
saw
it
fall
near
him
and
did
sagacity
but
moved
not
when
another
followed
and
then
another
he
popped
down
and
caught
up
one
of
the
crumbs
but
not
quite
understanding
this
mystery
fled
with
it
for
more
security
to
an
eminence
to
wit
the
hermit
knee
and
so
the
game
proceeded
till
a
much
larger
fragment
than
usual
rolled
along
here
was
a
prize
cockrobin
pounced
on
it
bore
it
aloft
and
fled
so
swiftly
into
the
world
with
it
the
cave
resounded
with
the
buffeted
air
now
bless
thee
sweet
bird
sighed
the
stricken
solitary
thy
wings
are
music
and
thou
a
feathered
ray
camedst
to
light
my
darkened
and
from
that
to
his
orisons
and
then
to
his
tools
with
a
little
bit
of
courage
and
this
was
his
day
work
veni

gratia
quae

perpeti
and
so
the
days
rolled
on
and
the
weather
got
colder
and
heart
got
warmer
and
despondency
was
rolling
away
and
somehow
or
another
it
was
gone
he
had
outlived
it
it
had
come
like
a
cloud
and
it
went
like
one
and
presently
all
was
reversed
his
cell
seemed
illuminated
with
joy
his
work
pleased
him
his
prayers
were
full
of
unction
his
psalms
of
praise
hosts
of
little
birds
followed
their
crimson
leader
and
flying
from
snow
and
a
parish
full
of
cains
made
friends
one
after
another
with
abel
fast
friends
and
one
keen
frosty
night
as
he
sang
the
praises
of
god
to
his
tuneful
psaltery
and
his
hollow
cave
rang
forth
the
holy
psalmody
upon
the
night
as
if
that
cave
itself
was
surrounding
shell
or
david
harp
he
heard
a
clear
whine
not
unmelodious
it
became
louder
and
less
in
tune
he
peeped
through
the
chinks
of
his
rude
door
and
there
sat
a
great
red
wolf
moaning
melodiously
with
his
nose
high
in
the
air
clement
was
rejoiced
my
sins
are
going
he
cried
and
the
creatures
of
god
are
owning
me
one
after
and
in
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
he
struck
up
the
laud
praise
him
all
ye
creatures
of
his
let
everything
that
hath
breath
praise
the
and
all
the
time
he
sang
the
wolf
bayed
at
intervals
but
above
all
he
seemed
now
to
be
drawing
nearer
to
that
celestial
intercourse
which
was
the
sign
and
the
bliss
of
the
true
hermit
for
he
had
dreams
about
the
saints
and
angels
so
vivid
they
were
more
like
visions
he
saw
bright
figures
clad
in
woven
snow
they
bent
on
him
eyes
lovelier
than
those
of
the
antelope
he
had
seen
at
rome
and
fanned
him
with
broad
wings
hued
like
the
rainbow
and
their
gentle
voices
bade
him
speed
upon
his
course
he
had
not
long
enjoyed
this
felicity
when
his
dreams
began
to
take
another
and
a
strange
complexion
he
wandered
with
fra
colonna
over
the
relics
of
antique
nations
and
the
friar
was
lame
and
had
a
staff
and
this
staff
he
waved
over
the
mighty
ruins
and
were
they
egyptian
greek
or
roman
straightway
the
temples
and
palaces
whose
wrecks
they
were
rose
again
like
an
exhalation
and
were
thronged
with
the
famous
dead
songsters
that
might
have
eclipsed
both
apollo
and
his
rival
poured
forth
their
lays
women
in
form
and
draped
like
minerva
swam
round
the
marble
courts
in
voluptuous
but
easy
and
graceful
dances
here
sculptors
carved
away
amidst
admiring
pupils
and
forms
of
supernatural
beauty
grew
out
of
parian
marble
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
grave
philosophers
conversed
on
high
and
subtle
matters
with
youth
listening
reverently
it
was
a
long
time
ago
and
still
beneath
all
this
wonderful
panorama
a
sort
of
suspicion
or
expectation
lurked
in
the
dreamer
mind
this
is
a
prologue
a
flourish
there
is
something
behind
something
that
means
me
no
good
something
mysterious
and
one
night
that
the
wizard
colonna
had
transcended
himself
he
pointed
with
his
stick
and
there
was
a
swallowing
up
of
many
great
ancient
cities
and
the
pair
stood
on
a
vast
sandy
plain
with
a
huge
crimson
sun
sinking
to
rest
there
were
great
and
there
were
bulrush
hives
scarce
a
man
height
dotted
all
about
to
the
sandy
horizon
and
the
crimson
sun
these
are
the
anchorites
of
the
theban
desert
said
colonna
calmly
followers
not
of
christ
and
his
apostles
and
the
great
fathers
but
of
the
greek
pupils
of
the
egyptian
pupils
of
the
brachmans
and
and
clement
thought
that
he
burned
to
go
and
embrace
the
holy
men
and
tell
them
his
troubles
and
seek
their
advice
but
he
was
tied
by
the
feet
somehow
and
could
not
move
and
the
crimson
sun
sank
and
it
got
dusk
and
the
hives
scarce
visible
and
colonna
figure
became
shadowy
and
shapeless
but
his
eyes
glowed
ten
times
brighter
and
this
thing
all
eyes
spoke
and
said
nay
let
them
be
a
pack
of
fools
i
see
how
dismal
it
all
then
with
a
sudden
sprightliness
but
i
hear
one
of
them
has
a
manuscript
of
petronius
on
papyrus
i
go
to
buy
it
farewell
for
ever
for
ever
for
and
it
was
pitch
dark
and
a
light
came
at
clement
back
like
a
gentle
stroke
a
glorious
roseate
light
it
warmed
as
well
as
brightened
it
loosened
his
feet
from
the
ground
he
turned
round
and
there
her
face
irradiated
with
sunshine
and
her
hair
glittering
like
the
gloriola
of
a
saint
was
margaret
brandt
she
blushed
and
smiled
and
cast
a
look
of
ineffable
tenderness
on
him
gerard
she
murmured
be
whose
thou
wilt
by
day
but
at
night
be
mine
even
as
she
spoke
the
agitation
of
seeing
her
so
suddenly
awakened
him
and
he
found
himself
lying
trembling
from
head
to
foot
that
radiant
figure
and
mellow
voice
seemed
to
have
struck
his
nightly
keynote
awake
he
could
pray
and
praise
and
worship
god
he
was
master
of
his
thoughts
but
if
he
closed
his
eyes
in
sleep
margaret
or
satan
in
her
shape
beset
him
a
seeming
angel
of
light
he
might
dream
of
a
thousand
different
things
wide
as
the
poles
asunder
ere
he
woke
the
imperial
figure
was
sure
to
come
and
extinguish
all
the
rest
in
a
moment
stellas
exortus
uti
aetherius
sol
for
she
came
glowing
with
two
beauties
never
before
united
an
angel
radiance
and
a
woman
blushes
angels
can
not
blush
so
he
knew
it
was
a
fiend
he
was
alarmed
but
not
so
much
surprised
as
at
the
demon
last
artifice
from
anthony
to
nicholas
of
the
rock
scarce
hermit
that
had
not
been
thus
beset
sometimes
with
gay
voluptuous
visions
sometimes
with
lovely
phantoms
warm
tangible
and
womanly
without
demons
within
nor
always
baffled
even
by
the
saints
witness
that
angel
form
with
a
devil
heart
that
came
hanging
its
lovely
head
like
a
bruised
flower
to
macarius
with
a
feigned
tale
and
wept
and
wept
and
wept
and
beguiled
him
first
of
his
tears
and
then
of
half
his
virtue
but
with
the
examples
of
satanic
power
and
craft
had
come
down
copious
records
of
the
hermits
triumphs
and
the
weapons
by
which
they
had
conquered
domandum
est
corpus
the
body
must
be
tamed
this
had
been
their
watchword
for
twelve
hundred
years
it
was
a
tremendous
for
they
called
the
earthly
affections
as
well
as
appetites
body
and
crushed
the
whole
heart
through
the
suffering
and
mortified
flesh
clement
then
said
to
himself
that
the
great
enemy
of
man
had
retired
but
to
spring
with
more
effect
and
had
allowed
him
a
few
days
of
true
purity
and
joy
only
to
put
him
off
his
guard
against
the
soft
blandishments
he
was
pouring
over
the
soul
that
had
survived
the
buffeting
of
his
black
wings
he
applied
himself
to
tame
the
body
he
shortened
his
sleep
lengthened
his
prayers
and
increased
his
severe
temperance
to
abstinence
hitherto
following
the
ordinary
rule
he
had
eaten
only
at
sunset
now
he
ate
but
once
in
hours
drinking
a
little
water
every
day
on
this
the
visions
became
more
distinct
then
he
flew
to
a
famous
antidote
to
the
grand
febrifuge
of
anchorites
cold
water
he
found
the
deepest
part
of
the
stream
that
ran
by
his
cell
it
rose
not
far
off
at
a
holy
well
and
clearing
the
bottom
of
the
large
stones
made
a
hole
where
he
could
stand
in
water
to
the
chin
and
fortified
by
so
many
examples
he
sprang
from
his
rude
bed
upon
the
next
diabolical
assault
and
entered
the
icy
water
it
made
him
gasp
and
almost
shriek
with
the
cold
it
froze
his
marrow
i
shall
die
he
cried
i
shall
die
but
better
this
than
fire
and
the
next
day
he
was
so
stiff
in
all
his
joints
he
could
not
move
and
he
seemed
one
great
ache
and
even
in
sleep
he
felt
that
his
very
bones
were
like
so
many
raging
teeth
till
the
phantom
he
dreaded
came
and
gave
one
pitying
smile
and
all
the
pain
was
gone
then
feeling
that
to
go
into
the
icy
water
again
enfeebled
by
fasts
as
he
was
might
perhaps
carry
the
guilt
of
suicide
he
scourged
himself
till
the
blood
ran
and
so
lay
down
smarting
and
when
exhaustion
began
to
blunt
the
smart
down
to
a
throb
that
moment
the
present
was
away
and
the
past
came
smiling
back
he
sat
with
margaret
at
the
feast
the
minstrels
played
divinely
and
the
purple
fountains
gushed
youth
and
love
reigned
in
each
heart
and
perfumed
the
very
air
then
the
scene
shifted
and
they
stood
at
the
altar
together
man
and
wife
and
no
interruption
this
time
and
they
wandered
hand
in
hand
and
told
each
other
their
horrible
dreams
as
for
him
he
had
dreamed
she
was
dead
and
he
was
a
monk
and
really
the
dream
had
been
so
vivid
and
so
full
of
particulars
that
only
his
eyesight
could
even
now
convince
him
it
was
only
a
dream
and
they
were
really
and
this
new
keynote
once
struck
every
tune
ran
upon
it
awake
he
was
clement
the
hermit
risen
from
unearthly
visions
of
the
night
as
dangerous
as
they
were
sweet
asleep
he
was
gerard
eliassoen
the
happy
husband
of
the
loveliest
and
best
and
truest
girl
in
holland
all
the
happier
that
he
had
been
for
some
time
the
sport
of
hideous
dreams
in
which
he
had
lost
her
his
constant
fasts
coupled
with
other
austerities
and
the
deep
mental
anxiety
of
a
man
fighting
with
a
supernatural
foe
had
now
reduced
him
nearly
to
a
skeleton
but
still
on
those
aching
bones
hung
flesh
unsubdued
and
quivering
with
an
earthly
passion
so
however
he
thought
or
why
had
ill
spirits
such
power
over
him
his
opinion
was
confirmed
when
one
day
he
detected
himself
sinking
to
sleep
actually
with
a
feeling
of
complacency
because
now
margaret
would
come
and
he
should
feel
no
more
pain
and
the
unreal
would
be
real
and
the
real
unreal
for
an
hour
on
this
he
rose
hastily
with
a
cry
of
dismay
and
stripping
to
the
skin
climbed
up
to
the
brambles
above
his
cave
and
flung
himself
on
them
and
rolled
on
them
writhing
with
the
pain
then
he
came
into
his
den
a
mass
of
gore
and
lay
moaning
for
hours
till
out
of
sheer
exhaustion
he
fell
into
a
deep
and
dreamless
sleep
he
awoke
to
bodily
pain
and
mental
exultation
he
had
broken
the
fatal
spell
yes
it
was
broken
another
and
another
day
passed
and
her
image
molested
him
no
more
but
he
caught
himself
sighing
at
his
victory
the
birds
got
tamer
and
tamer
they
perched
upon
his
hand
two
of
them
let
him
gild
their
little
claws
eating
but
once
in
two
days
he
had
more
to
give
them
his
tranquility
was
not
to
last
long
a
woman
voice
came
in
from
the
outside
told
him
his
own
story
in
a
very
few
words
and
asked
him
to
tell
her
where
gerard
was
to
be
found
he
was
so
astounded
he
could
only
say
with
an
instinct
of
pray
for
the
soul
of
gerard
the
son
of
eli
meaning
that
he
was
dead
to
the
world
and
he
sat
wondering
when
the
woman
was
gone
he
determined
after
an
inward
battle
to
risk
being
seen
and
he
peeped
after
her
to
see
who
it
could
be
but
he
took
so
many
precautions
and
she
ran
so
quickly
back
to
her
friend
that
the
road
was
clear
satan
said
he
directly
and
that
night
back
came
his
visions
of
earthly
love
and
happiness
so
vividly
he
could
count
every
auburn
hair
in
margaret
head
and
see
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
then
he
began
to
despair
and
said
i
must
leave
this
country
here
i
am
bound
fast
in
memory
chain
and
began
to
dread
his
cell
he
said
a
breath
from
hell
hath
infected
it
and
robbed
even
these
holy
words
of
their
and
unconsciously
imitating
jerome
a
victim
of
earthly
hallucinations
as
overpowering
and
coarser
he
took
his
warmest
covering
out
into
the
wood
hard
by
and
there
flung
down
under
a
tree
that
torn
and
wrinkled
leather
bag
of
bones
which
a
little
ago
might
have
served
a
sculptor
for
apollo
whether
the
fever
of
his
imagination
intermitted
as
a
master
mind
of
our
day
has
shown
that
all
things
intermit
or
that
this
really
broke
some
subtle
link
i
know
not
but
his
sleep
was
dreamless
he
awoke
nearly
frozen
but
warm
with
joy
within
i
shall
yet
be
a
true
hermit
dei
gratia
said
he
the
next
day
some
good
soul
left
on
his
little
platform
a
new
pelisse
and
cape
warm
soft
and
ample
he
had
a
moment
misgiving
on
account
of
its
delicious
softness
and
warmth
but
that
passed
it
was
the
right
skin
and
a
mark
that
heaven
approved
his
present
course
it
restored
warmth
to
his
bones
after
he
came
in
from
his
short
rest
and
now
at
one
moment
he
saw
victory
before
him
if
he
could
but
live
to
it
at
another
he
said
to
himself
is
but
another
lull
be
on
thy
guard
and
this
thought
agitated
his
nerves
and
kept
him
in
continual
awe
he
was
like
a
soldier
within
the
enemy
lines
one
night
a
beautiful
clear
frosty
night
he
came
back
to
his
cell
after
a
short
rest
the
stars
were
wonderful
heaven
seemed
a
thousand
times
larger
as
well
as
brighter
than
earth
and
to
look
with
a
thousand
eyes
instead
of
one
oh
wonderful
he
cried
that
there
should
be
men
who
do
crimes
by
night
and
others
scarce
less
mad
who
live
for
this
little
world
and
not
for
that
great
and
glorious
one
which
nightly
to
all
eyes
not
blinded
by
custom
reveals
its
glowing
glories
thank
god
i
am
a
and
in
this
mood
he
came
to
his
cell
door
he
paused
at
it
it
was
closed
why
methought
i
left
it
open
said
he
the
wind
there
is
not
a
breath
of
wind
what
means
this
he
stood
with
his
hand
upon
the
rugged
door
he
looked
through
one
of
the
great
chinks
for
it
was
much
smaller
in
places
than
the
aperture
it
pretended
to
close
and
saw
his
little
oil
wick
burning
just
where
he
had
left
it
how
is
it
with
me
he
sighed
when
i
start
and
tremble
at
nothing
either
i
did
shut
it
or
the
fiend
hath
shut
it
after
me
to
disturb
my
happy
soul
retro
sathanas
and
he
entered
his
cave
rapidly
and
began
with
somewhat
nervous
expedition
to
light
one
of
his
largest
tapers
while
he
was
lighting
it
there
was
a
soft
sigh
in
the
cave
he
started
and
dropped
the
candle
just
as
it
was
lighting
and
it
went
out
he
stooped
for
it
hurriedly
and
lighted
it
listening
intently
when
it
was
lighted
he
shaded
it
with
his
hand
from
behind
and
threw
the
faint
light
all
round
the
cell
in
the
farthest
corner
the
outline
of
the
wall
seemed
broken
he
took
a
step
towards
the
place
with
his
heart
beating
the
candle
at
the
same
time
getting
brighter
he
saw
it
was
the
figure
of
a
woman

xciv
her
attitude
was
one
to
excite
pity
rather
than
terror
in
eyes
not
blinded
by
a
preconceived
notion
her
bosom
was
fluttering
like
a
bird
and
the
red
and
white
coming
and
going
in
her
cheeks
and
she
had
her
hand
against
the
wall
by
the
instinct
of
timid
things
she
trembled
so
and
the
marvellous
mixed
gaze
of
love
and
pious
awe
and
pity
and
tender
memories
those
purple
eyes
cast
on
the
emaciated
and
glaring
hermit
was
an
event
in
nature
aha
he
cried
thou
art
come
at
last
in
flesh
and
blood
come
to
me
as
thou
camest
to
holy
anthony
but
i
am
ware
of
thee
i
thought
thy
wiles
were
not
exhausted
i
am
with
this
he
snatched
up
his
small
crucifix
and
held
it
out
at
her
astonished
and
the
candle
in
the
other
hand
both
crucifix
and
candle
shaking
violently

ah
no
cried
she
piteously
and
put
out
two
pretty
deprecating
palms
alas
work
me
no
ill
it
is
liar
shouted
the
hermit
margaret
was
fair
but
not
so
supernatural
fair
as
thou
thou
didst
shrink
at
that
sacred
name
thou
subtle
hypocrite
in
nomine
dei
exorcizo
ah
jesu
gasped
margaret
in
extremity
of
terror
curse
me
not
i
will
go
home
i
thought
i
might
come
for
very
manhood
me
not
oh
gerard
is
it
thus
you
and
i
meet
after
all
after
all
and
she
cowered
almost
to
her
knees
and
sobbed
with
superstitious
fear
and
wounded
affection
impregnated
as
he
was
with
satanophobia
he
might
perhaps
have
doubted
still
whether
this
distressed
creature
all
woman
and
nature
was
not
all
art
and
fiend
but
her
spontaneous
appeal
to
that
sacred
name
dissolved
his
chimera
and
let
him
see
with
his
eyes
and
hear
with
his
ears
he
uttered
a
cry
of
and
tried
to
raise
her
but
what
with
fasts
what
with
the
overpowering
emotion
of
a
long
solitude
so
broken
he
could
not
what
he
gasped
shaking
over
her
and
is
it
thou
and
have
i
met
thee
with
hard
words
alas
and
they
were
both
choked
with
emotion
and
could
not
speak
for
a
while
i
heed
it
not
much
said
margaret
bravely
struggling
with
her
tears
you
took
me
for
another
for
a
devil
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
forgive
me
sweet
soul
and
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
more
than
a
word
at
a
time
he
said
i
have
been
much
beset
by
the
evil
one
since
i
came
margaret
looked
round
with
a
shudder
like
enow
then
oh
take
my
hand
and
let
me
lead
thee
from
this
foul
he
gazed
at
her
with
astonishment
what
desert
my
cell
and
go
into
the
world
again
is
it
for
that
thou
hast
come
to
me
said
he
sadly
and
reproachfully
ay
gerard
i
am
come
to
take
thee
to
thy
pretty
vicarage
art
vicar
of
gouda
thanks
to
heaven
and
thy
good
brother
giles
and
mother
and
i
have
made
it
so
neat
for
thee
gerard
is
well
enow
in
winter
i
promise
thee
but
bide
a
bit
till
the
hawthorn
bloom
and
anon
thy
walls
put
on
their
kirtle
of
brave
roses
and
sweet
woodbine
have
we
forgotten
thee
and
the
foolish
things
thou
lovest
and
dear
gerard
thy
mother
is
waiting
and
is
late
for
her
to
be
out
of
her
bed
prithee
prithee
come
and
the
moment
we
are
out
of
this
foul
hole
show
thee
a
treasure
thou
hast
gotten
and
knowest
nought
o
or
sure
hadst
never
fled
from
us
so
alas
what
is
to
do
what
have
i
ignorantly
said
to
be
regarded
thus
for
he
had
drawn
himself
all
up
into
a
heap
and
was
looking
at
her
with
a
strange
gaze
of
fear
and
suspicion
blended
unhappy
girl
said
he
solemnly
yet
deeply
agitated
would
you
have
me
risk
my
soul
and
yours
for
a
miserable
vicarage
and
the
flowers
that
grow
on
it
but
this
is
not
thy
doing
the
bowelless
fiend
sends
thee
poor
simple
girl
to
me
with
this
bait
but
oh
cunning
fiend
i
will
unmask
thee
even
to
this
thine
instrument
and
she
shall
see
thee
and
abhor
thee
as
i
do
margaret
my
lost
love
why
am
i
here
because
i
love
oh
no
gerard
you
love
me
not
or
you
would
not
have
hidden
from
me
there
was
no
let
there
be
no
deceit
between
us
twain
that
have
loved
so
true
and
after
this
night
shall
meet
no
more
on
now
god
forbid
said
she
i
love
thee
and
thou
hast
not
forgotten
me
or
thou
hadst
married
ere
this
and
hadst
not
been
the
one
to
find
me
buried
here
from
sight
of
man
i
am
a
priest
a
monk
what
but
folly
or
sin
can
come
of
you
and
me
living
neighbours
and
feeding
a
passion
innocent
once
but
now
so
heaven
wills
it
impious
and
unholy
no
though
my
heart
break
i
must
be
firm
is
i
that
am
the
man
is
i
that
am
the
priest
you
and
i
must
meet
no
more
till
i
am
schooled
by
solitude
and
thou
art
wedded
to
i
consent
to
my
doom
but
not
to
thine
i
would
ten
times
liever
die
yet
i
will
marry
ay
wed
misery
itself
sooner
than
let
thee
lie
in
this
foul
dismal
place
with
yon
sweet
manse
awaiting
for
clement
groaned
at
each
word
she
spoke
out
stood
clearer
and
clearer
two
things
his
duty
and
the
agony
it
must
cost
my
beloved
said
he
with
a
strange
mixture
of
tenderness
and
dogged
resolution
i
bless
thee
for
giving
me
one
more
sight
of
thy
sweet
face
and
may
god
forgive
thee
and
bless
thee
for
destroying
in
a
minute
the
holy
peace
it
hath
taken
six
months
of
solitude
to
build
no
matter
a
year
of
penance
will
dei

restore
me
to
my
calm
my
poor
margaret
i
seem
cruel
yet
i
am
kind
is
best
we
part
ay
this
part
gerard
never
we
have
seen
what
comes
of
parting
part
why
you
have
not
heard
half
my
story
no
nor
the
tithe
is
not
for
thy
mere
comfort
i
take
thee
to
gouda
manse
hear
me
i
may
not
thy
very
voice
is
a
temptation
with
its
music
but
i
say
you
shall
hear
me
gerard
for
forth
this
place
i
go
not
then
must
we
part
by
other
means
said
clement
sadly
alack
what
other
means
wouldst
put
me
to
thine
own
door
being
the
stronger
nay
margaret
well
thou
knowest
i
would
suffer
many
deaths
rather
than
put
force
on
thee
thy
sweet
body
is
dearer
to
me
than
my
own
but
a
million
times
dearer
to
me
are
our
immortal
souls
both
thine
and
mine
i
have
withstood
this
direst
temptation
of
all
long
enow
now
i
must
fly
it
farewell
farewell
he
made
to
the
door
and
had
actually
opened
it
and
got
half
out
when
she
darted
after
and
caught
him
by
the
arm
nay
then
another
must
speak
for
me
i
thought
to
reward
thee
for
yielding
to
me
but
unkind
that
thou
art
i
need
his
help
i
find
turn
then
this
way
one
nay
but
i
say
ay
and
then
turn
thy
back
on
us
an
thou
she
somewhat
relaxed
her
grasp
thinking
he
would
never
deny
her
so
small
a
favour
but
at
this
he
saw
his
opportunity
and
seized
it
fly
clement
fly
he
almost
shrieked
and
his
religious
enthusiasm
giving
him
for
a
moment
his
old
strength
he
burst
wildly
away
from
her
and
after
a
few
steps
bounded
over
the
little
stream
and
ran
beside
it
but
finding
he
was
not
followed
stopped
and
looked
back
she
was
lying
on
her
face
with
her
hands
spread
out
yes
without
meaning
it
he
had
thrown
her
down
and
hurt
her
when
he
saw
that
he
groaned
and
turned
back
a
step
but
suddenly
by
another
impulse
flung
himself
into
the
icy
water
instead
there
kill
my
body
he
cried
but
save
my
soul
whilst
he
stood
there
up
to
his
throat
in
liquid
ice
so
to
speak
margaret
uttered
one
long
piteous
moan
and
rose
to
her
knees
he
saw
her
as
plain
almost
as
in
midday
saw
her
pale
face
and
her
eyes
glistening
and
then
in
the
still
night
he
heard
these
words
oh
god
thou
that
knowest
all
thou
seest
how
i
am
used
forgive
me
then
for
i
will
not
live
another
with
this
she
suddenly
started
to
her
feet
and
flew
like
some
wild
creature
wounded
to
death
close
by
his
miserable
shrieking
cruel
cruel
cruel
cruel
what
manifold
anguish
may
burst
from
a
human
heart
in
a
single
syllable
there
were
wounded
love
and
wounded
pride
and
despair
and
coming
madness
all
in
that
piteous
cry
clement
heard
and
it
froze
his
heart
with
terror
and
remorse
worse
than
the
icy
water
chilled
the
marrow
of
his
bones
he
felt
he
had
driven
her
from
him
for
ever
and
in
the
midst
of
his
dismal
triumph
the
greatest
he
had
won
there
came
an
almost
incontrollable
impulse
to
curse
the
church
to
curse
religion
itself
for
exacting
such
savage
cruelty
from
mortal
man
at
last
he
crawled
half
dead
out
of
the
water
and
staggered
to
his
den
i
am
safe
here
he
groaned
she
will
never
come
near
me
again
unmanly
ungrateful
wretch
that
i
and
he
flung
his
emaciated
frozen
body
down
on
the
floor
not
without
a
secret
hope
that
it
might
never
rise
thence
alive
but
presently
he
saw
by
the
that
it
was
past
midnight
on
this
he
rose
slowly
and
took
off
his
wet
things
and
moaning
all
the
time
at
the
pain
he
had
caused
her
he
loved
put
on
the
old
cilice
of
bristles
and
over
that
his
breastplate
he
had
never
worn
either
of
these
before
doubting
himself
worthy
to
don
the
arms
of
that
tried
soldier
but
now
he
must
give
himself
every
aid
the
bristles
might
distract
his
earthly
remorse
by
bodily
pain
and
there
might
be
holy
virtue
in
the
breastplate
then
he
kneeled
down
and
prayed
god
humbly
to
release
him
that
very
night
from
the
burden
of
the
flesh
then
he
lighted
all
his
candles
and
recited
his
psalter
doggedly
each
word
seemed
to
come
like
a
lump
of
lead
from
a
leaden
heart
and
to
fall
leaden
to
the
ground
and
in
this
mechanical
office
every
now
and
then
he
moaned
with
all
his
soul
in
the
midst
of
which
he
suddenly
observed
a
little
bundle
in
the
corner
he
had
not
seen
before
in
the
feebler
light
and
at
one
end
of
it
something
like
gold
spun
into
silk
he
went
to
see
what
it
could
be
and
he
had
no
sooner
viewed
it
closer
than
he
threw
up
his
hands
with
rapture
it
is
a
seraph
he
whispered
a
lovely
seraph
heaven
hath
witnessed
my
bitter
trial
and
approves
my
cruelty
and
this
flower
of
the
skies
is
sent
to
cheer
me
fainting
under
my
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
gazed
with
ecstasy
on
its
golden
hair
and
its
tender
skin
and
cheeks
like
a
peach
let
me
feast
my
sad
eyes
on
thee
ere
thou
leavest
me
for
thine
abode
and
my
cell
darkens
again
at
thy
parting
as
it
did
at
with
all
this
the
hermit
disturbed
the
lovely
visitor
he
opened
wide
two
eyes
the
colour
of
heaven
and
seeing
a
strange
figure
kneeling
over
him
he
cried
piteously
mumma
and
the
tears
began
to
run
down
his
little
cheeks
perhaps
after
all
clement
who
for
more
than
six
months
had
not
looked
on
the
human
face
divine
estimated
childish
beauty
more
justly
than
we
can
and
in
truth
this
fair
northern
child
with
its
long
golden
hair
was
far
more
angelic
than
any
of
our
imagined
angels
but
now
the
spell
was
broken
yet
not
unhappily
clement
it
may
be
remembered
was
fond
of
children
and
true
monastic
life
fosters
this
sentiment
the
innocent
distress
on
the
cherubic
face
the
tears
that
ran
so
smoothly
from
those
transparent
violets
his
eyes
and
his
pretty
dismal
cry
for
his
only
friend
his
mother
went
through
the
hermit
heart
he
employed
all
his
gentleness
and
all
his
art
to
soothe
him
and
as
the
little
soul
was
wonderfully
intelligent
for
his
age
presently
succeeded
so
far
that
he
ceased
to
cry
out
and
wonder
took
the
place
of
fear
while
in
silence
broken
only
in
little
gulps
he
scanned
with
great
tearful
eyes
this
strange
figure
that
looked
so
wild
but
spoke
so
kindly
and
wore
armour
yet
did
not
kill
little
boys
but
coaxed
them
clement
was
equally
perplexed
to
know
how
this
little
human
flower
came
to
lie
sparkling
and
blooming
in
his
gloomy
cave
but
he
remembered
he
had
left
the
door
wide
open
and
he
was
driven
to
conclude
that
owing
to
this
negligence
some
unfortunate
creature
of
high
or
low
degree
had
seized
this
opportunity
to
get
rid
of
her
child
for
at
this
his
bowels
yearned
so
over
the
poor
deserted
cherub
that
the
tears
of
pure
tenderness
stood
in
his
eyes
and
still
beneath
the
crime
of
the
mother
he
saw
the
divine
goodness
which
had
so
directed
her
heartlessness
as
to
comfort
his
servant
breaking
heart
now
bless
thee
bless
thee
bless
thee
sweet
innocent
i
would
not
change
thee
for
a
cherub
in
at
pooty
replied
the
infant
ignoring
contemptuously
after
the
manner
of
infants
all
remarks
that
did
not
interest
him
what
is
pretty
here
my
love
besides
thee
said
the
boy
pointing
to
the
hermit
breastplate
quot

child
screamed
at
his
father
glittering
casque
and
nodding
crest
and
here
was
a
mediaeval
babe
charmed
with
a
polished
cuirass
and
his
griefs
assuaged
there
are
prettier
things
here
than
that
said
clement
there
are
little
birds

an
he
then
confided
in
very
broken
language
that
the
storks
with
their
great
flapping
wings
scared
him
and
were
a
great
trouble
and
worry
to
him
darkening
his
existence

or
less
ay
but
my
birds
are
very
little
and
good
and
oh
so
pretty

the

authoritatively

alas

shall
have
to
fill
her
place
as
best
i
may
hast
thou
no

as
well
as
mammy
sweet
one
now
not
only
was
this
conversation
from
first
to
last
the
relative
ages
situations
and
all
circumstances
of
the
parties
considered
as
strange
a
one
as
ever
took
place
between
two
mortal
creatures
but
at
or
within
a
second
or
two
of
the
hermit
last
question
to
turn
the
strange
into
the
marvellous
came
an
unseen
witness
to
whom
every
word
that
passed
carried
ten
times
the
force
it
did
to
either
of
the
speakers
since
therefore
it
is
with
her
eyes
you
must
now
see
and
hear
with
her
ears
i
go
back
a
step
for
her
margaret
when
she
ran
past
gerard
was
almost
mad
she
was
in
that
state
of
mind
in
which
affectionate
mothers
have
been
known
to
kill
their
children
sometimes
along
with
themselves
sometimes
alone
which
last
is
certainly
maniacal
she
ran
to
reicht
heynes
pale
and
trembling
and
clasped
her
round
the
neck
oh
reicht
oh
reicht
and
could
say
no
more
reicht
kissed
her
and
began
to
whimper
and
would
you
believe
it
the
great
mastiff
uttered
one
long
whine
even
his
glimmer
of
sense
taught
him
grief
was
afoot
oh
reicht
moaned
the
despised
beauty
as
soon
as
she
could
utter
a
word
for
choking
see
how
he
has
served
me
and
she
showed
her
hands
that
were
bleeding
with
falling
on
the
stony
ground
he
threw
me
down
he
was
so
eager
to
fly
from
me
he
took
me
for
a
devil
he
said
i
came
to
tempt
him
am
i
the
woman
to
tempt
a
man
you
know
me
nay
in
sooth
sweet
mistress
margaret
the
last
i
the
and
he
would
not
look
at
my
child
i
fling
myself
and
him
into
the
rotter
this
oh
fie
fie
eh
my
sweet
woman

not
so

any
man
that
breathes

your
child

my
child
where

he
why
reicht
i
have
left
him
behind
oh
shame
is
it
possible
i
can
love
him
to
that
degree
as
to
forget
my
child
ah
i
am
rightly
served
for
and
she
sat
down
and
faithful
reicht
beside
her
and
they
sobbed
in
one
another
arms
after
a
while
margaret
left
off
sobbing
and
said
doggedly
let
us
go
ay
but
the
bairn
oh
he
is
well
where
he
is
my
heart
is
turned
against
my
very
child
he
cares
nought
for
him
would
see
him
nor
hear
speak
of
him
and
i
took
him
there
so
proud
and
made
his
hair
so
nice
i
did
and
put
his
new
frock
and
cowl
on
him
nay
turn
about
it
his
child
as
well
as
mine
let
him
keep
it
awhile
mayhap
that
will
learn
him
to
think
more
of
its
mother
and
his
high
words
off
an
empty
stomach
said
reicht
time
will
show
come
you
they
departed
and
time
did
show
quicker
than
he
levels
abbeys
for
at
the
second
step
margaret
stopped
and
could
neither
go
one
way
nor
the
other
but
stood
stock
still
reicht
said
she
piteously
what
else

on

said
you
could
think

we
were
in
our
beds
much
more

led
the
way
and
margaret
followed
readily
enough
in
that
direction
but
as
they
drew
near
the
cell
she
stopped
again
reicht
go
you
and
ask
him
will
he
give
me
back
my
boy
for
i
could
not
bear
the
sight
of

a
sorry
ending
after
all
that

been
betwixt
you

thine
heart
whisper
no
excuse

oh
weary
world

him
reicht
i
would
not
harm
a
hair
of
his
head
for
all
that
is
in
nature
but
look
on
him
i
can
not
i
have
taken
a
horror
of
him
oh
when
i
think
of
all
i
have
suffered
for
him
and
what
i
came
here
this
night
to
do
for
him
and
brought
my
own
darling
to
kiss
him
and
call
him
father
ah
luke
my
poor
chap
my
wound
showeth
me
thine
i
have
thought
too
little
of
thy
pangs
whose
true
affection
i
despised
and
now
my
own
is
despised

if
the
poor
lad
was
here
now
he
would
have
a
good
well

not
far
off

reicht
heynes
but
somehow
she
did
not
say
it
with
alacrity
speak
not
to
me
of
any
man
said
margaret
bitterly
i
hate
them
for
the
sake
of
one
flout
me
not
but
prithee
go
forward
and
get
me
what
is
my
own
my
sole
joy
in
the
world
thou
knowest
i
am
on
thorns
till
i
have
him
to
my
bosom
reicht
went
forward
margaret
sat
by
the
roadside
and
covered
her
face
with
her
apron
and
rocked
herself
after
the
manner
of
her
country
for
her
soul
was
full
of
bitterness
and
grief
so
severe
indeed
was
the
internal
conflict
that
she
did
not
hear
reicht
running
back
to
her
and
started
violently
when
the
young
woman
laid
a
hand
upon
her
shoulder
mistress
margaret
said
reicht
quietly
take
a
fool
advice
that
loves
ye
go
softly
to
yon
cave
wi
all
the
ears
and
eyes
your
mother
ever
gave
why
reicht
stammered
margaret
i
thought
the
cave
was
afire
was
so
light
inside
and
there
were
voices
ay
not
one
but
twain
and
all
unlike
a
man
and
a
little
talking
as
pleasant
as
you
and
me
i
am
no
great
hand
at
a
keyhole
for
my
part
is
paltry
work
but
if
so
be
voices
were
a
talking
in
yon
cave
and
them
that
owned
those
voices
were
so
near
to
me
as
those
are
to
thee
i
go
on
all
fours
like
a
fox
and
i
crawl
on
my
belly
like
a
serpent
ere
i
lose
one
word
that
passes
atwixt
those
whisht
reicht
bless
thee
bide
thou
here
buss
me
pray
for
me
and
almost
ere
the
agitated
words
had
left
her
lips
margaret
was
flying
towards
the
hermitage
as
noiselessly
as
a
lapwing
arrived
near
it
she
crouched
and
there
was
something
truly
serpentine
in
the
gliding
flexible
noiseless
movements
by
which
she
reached
the
very
door
and
there
she
found
a
chink
and
listened
and
often
it
cost
her
a
struggle
not
to
burst
in
upon
them
but
warned
by
defeat
she
was
cautious
and
resolute
let
well
alone
and
after
a
while
slowly
and
noiselessly
she
reared
her
head
like
a
snake
its
crest
to
where
she
saw
the
broadest
chink
of
all
and
looked
with
all
her
eyes
and
soul
as
well
as
listened
the
little
boy
then
being
asked
whether
he
had
no
daddy
at
first
shook
his
head
and
would
say
nothing
but
being
pressed
he
suddenly
seemed
to
remember
something
and
said
he
ill
man
run
away
and
left
poor
she
who
heard
this
winced
it
was
as
new
to
her
as
to
clement
some
interfering
foolish
woman
had
gone
and
said
this
to
the
boy
and
now
out
it
came
in
gerard
very
face
his
answer
surprised
her
he
burst
out
the
villain
the
monster
he
must
be
born
without
bowels
to
desert
thee
sweet
one
ah
he
little
knows
the
joy
he
has
turned
his
back
on
well
my
little
dove
i
must
be
father
and
mother
to
thee
since
the
one
runs
away
and
abandons
thee
to
my
care
now
i
shall
ask
the
good
people
that
bring
me
my
food
to
fetch
some
nice
eggs
and
milk
for
thee
as
well
for
bread

a
beautiful
place

thousand
times
fairer
and
better
than

and
there

little
cherubs
like
thyself
in
white
glad
to
welcome
thee
and
love
thee
wouldst
like
to
go
to
heaven
one
day
ay
along

then
nay
i
ont
my

to
her
heart

she
will
come
when

shall
i
do
to
pleasure

the
boy
clapping
his
hands
or
sing

song
i

and
he
became
excited
choose
then
a
song
or
a
ting
i
a
tong
nay
tell
i
a
tory
nay
ting
i
a
tong
nay
and
the
corners
of
his
little
mouth
turned
down
and
he
had
half
a
mind
to
weep
because
he
could
not
have
both
and
could
not
tell
which
to
forego
suddenly
his
little
face
cleared
ting
i
a
tory
said
he
sing
thee
a
story
baby
well
after
all
why
not
and
wilt

sit
my
knee
and
hear
it
then

breastplate

too
hard
for
thy
soft
cheek
so
and
now
i
must
doff
this
bristly
cilice
they
would
prick
thy
tender
skin
perhaps
make
it
bleed
as
they
have
me
i
see
so
and
now
i
put
on
my
best
pelisse
in
honour
of
thy
worshipful
visit

how
soft
and
warm
it
is
bless
the
good
soul
that
sent
it
and
now
i
sit
me
down
so
and
i
take
thee
on
my
left
knee
and
put
my
arm
under
thy
little
head

and

the
psaltery
and

a
little
tune
so
not
too
i
ikes
i
am
right
glad
o
now
list
the
he
chanted
a
child
story
in
a
sort
of
recitative
singing
a
little
moral
refrain
now
and
then
the
boy
listened
with
rapture
i
ikes

but
during
this
final
performance
nature
suddenly
held
out
her
leaden
sceptre
over
the
youthful
eyelids
i
is
not
eepy
whined
he
very
faintly
and
succumbed
clement
laid
down
his
psaltery
softly
and
began
to
rock
his
new
treasure
in
his
arms
and
to
crone
over
him
a
little
lullaby
well
known
in
tergou
with
which
his
own
mother
had
often
sent
him
off
and
the
child
sank
into
a
profound
sleep
upon
his
arm
and
he
stopped
croning
and
gazed
on
him
with
infinite
tenderness
yet
sadness
for
at
that
moment
he
could
not
help
thinking
what
might
have
been
but
for
a
piece
of
paper
with
a
lie
in
it
he
sighed
deeply
the
next
moment
the
moonlight
burst
into
his
cell
and
with
it
and
in
it
and
almost
as
swift
as
it
margaret
brandt
was
down
at
his
knee
with
a
timorous
hand
upon
his
shoulder
gerard
you
do
not
reject
us
you
can
not
more
than
one
hermit
had
received
a
present
of
this
kind
query
looking
craft
he
means
trade
or
profession
chapter
xcv
the
startled
hermit
glared
from
his
nurseling
to
margaret
and
from
her
to
him
in
amazement
equalled
only
by
his
agitation
at
her
so
unexpected
return
the
child
lay
asleep
on
his
left
arm
and
she
was
at
his
right
knee
no
longer
the
pale
scared
panting
girl
he
had
overpowered
so
easily
an
hour
or
two
ago
but
an
imperial
beauty
with
blushing
cheeks
and
sparkling
eyes
and
lips
sweetly
parted
in
triumph
and
her
whole
face
radiant
with
a
look
he
could
not
quite
read
for
he
had
never
yet
seen
it
on
her
maternal
pride
he
stared
and
stared
from
the
child
to
her
in
throbbing
amazement
us
he
gasped
at
last
and
still
his
eyes
turned
to
and
fro
margaret
was
surprised
in
her
turn
it
was
an
age
of
impressions
not
facts
what
she
cried
doth
not
a
father
know
his
own
child
and
a
man
of
god
too
fie
gerard
to
pretend
nay
thou
art
too
wise
too
good
not
to
have
why
i
watched
thee
and
now
look
at
you
twain
is
thine
own
flesh
and
blood
thou
holdest
to
thine
clement
trembled
what
words
are
these
he
stammered
this
angel
mine
whose
else
since
he
is
clement
turned
on
the
sleeping
child
with
a
look
beyond
the
power
of
the
pen
to
describe
and
trembled
all
over
as
his
eyes
seemed
to
absorb
the
little
love
margaret
eyes
followed
his
he
is
not
a
bit
like
me
said
she
proudly
but
oh
at
whiles
he
is
thy
very
image
in
little
and
see
this
golden
hair
thine
was
the
very
colour
at
his
age
ask
mother
else
and
see
this
mole
on
his
little
finger
now
look
at
thine
own
there
was
thy
mother
let
me
weet
thou
wast
marked
so
before
him
and
oh
gerard
this
our
child
found
thee
for
me
for
by
that
little
mark
on
thy
finger
i
knew
thee
for
his
father
when
i
watched
above
thy
window
and
saw
thee
feed
the
here
she
seized
the
child
hand
and
kissed
it
eagerly
and
got
half
of
it
into
her
mouth
heaven
knows
how
ah
bless
thee
thou
didst
find
thy
poor
daddy
for
her
and
now
thou
hast
made
us
friends
again
after
our
little
quarrel
the
first
the
last
wast
very
cruel
to
me
but
now
my
poor
gerard
and
i
forgive
thee
for
loving
of
thy
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
sobbed
clement
choking
and
lowered
by
fasts
and
unnerved
by
solitude
the
once
strong
man
was
hysterical
and
nearly
fainting
margaret
was
alarmed
but
having
experience
her
pity
was
greater
than
her
fear
nay
take
not
on
so
she
murmured
soothingly
and
put
a
gentle
hand
upon
his
brow
be
brave
so
so
dear
heart
thou
art
not
the
first
man
that
hath
gone
abroad
and
come
back
richer
by
a
lovely
little
self
than
he
went
forth
being
a
man
of
god
take
courage
and
say
he
sends
thee
this
to
comfort
thee
for
what
thou
hast
lost
in
me
and
that
is
not
so
very
much
my
lamb
for
sure
the
better
part
of
love
shall
cool
here
to
thee
though
it
may
in
thine
and
ought
being
a
priest
and
parson
of
i
priest
of
gouda
never
murmured
clement
in
a
faint
voice
i
am
a
friar
of
dominic
yet
speak
on
sweet
music
tell
me
all
that
has
happened
thee
before
we
are
parted
now
some
would
on
this
have
exclaimed
against
parting
at
all
and
raised
the
true
question
in
dispute
but
such
women
as
margaret
do
not
repeat
their
mistakes
it
is
very
hard
to
defeat
them
twice
where
their
hearts
are
set
on
a
thing
she
assented
and
turned
her
back
on
gouda
manse
as
a
thing
not
to
be
recurred
to
and
she
told
him
her
tale
dwelling
above
all
on
the
kindness
to
her
of
his
parents
and
while
she
related
her
troubles
his
hand
stole
to
hers
and
often
she
felt
him
wince
and
tremble
with
ire
and
often
press
her
hand
sympathizing
with
her
in
every
vein
oh
piteous
tale
of
a
true
heart
battling
alone
against
such
bitter
odds
said
he
it
all
seems
small
when
i
see
thee
here
again
and
nursing
my
boy
we
have
had
a
warning
gerard
true
friends
like
you
and
me
are
rare
and
they
are
mad
to
part
ere
death
divideth
and
that
is
true
said
clement
off
his
guard
and
then
she
would
have
him
tell
her
what
he
had
suffered
for
her
and
he
begged
her
to
excuse
him
and
she
consented
but
by
questions
quietly
revoked
her
consent
and
elicited
it
all
and
many
a
sigh
she
heaved
for
him
and
more
than
once
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
with
terror
at
his
perils
though
past
and
to
console
him
for
all
he
had
gone
through
she
kneeled
down
and
put
her
arms
under
the
little
boy
and
lifted
him
gently
up
kiss
him
softly
she
whispered
again
again
kiss
thy
fill
if
thou
canst
he
is
sound
is
all
i
can
do
to
comfort
thee
till
thou
art
out
of
this
foul
den
and
in
thy
sweet
manse
clement
shook
his
head
well
said
she
let
that
pass
know
that
i
have
been
sore
affronted
for
want
of
my
who
hath
dared
affront
thee
no
matter
those
that
will
do
it
again
if
thou
hast
lost
them
which
the
saints
i
lose
them
nay
there
they
lie
close
to
thy
where
where
oh
where
clement
hung
his
head
look
in
the
vulgate
heaven
forgive
me
i
thought
thou
wert
dead
and
a
saint
in
she
looked
and
on
the
blank
leaves
of
the
poor
soul
vulgate
she
found
her
marriage
lines
thank
god
she
cried
thank
god
oh
bless
thee
gerard
bless
thee
why
what
is
here
gerard
on
the
other
leaves
were
pinned
every
scrap
of
paper
she
had
ever
sent
him
and
their
two
names
she
had
once
written
together
in
sport
and
the
lock
of
her
hair
she
had
given
him
and
half
a
silver
coin
she
had
broken
with
him
and
a
straw
she
had
sucked
her
soup
with
the
first
day
he
ever
saw
her
when
margaret
saw
these
proofs
of
love
and
signs
of
a
gentle
heart
bereaved
even
her
exultation
at
getting
back
her
marriage
lines
was
overpowered
by
gushing
tenderness
she
almost
staggered
and
her
hand
went
to
her
bosom
and
she
leaned
her
brow
against
the
stone
cell
and
wept
so
silently
that
he
did
not
see
she
was
weeping
indeed
she
would
not
let
him
for
she
felt
that
to
befriend
him
now
she
must
be
the
stronger
and
emotion
weakens
gerard
said
she
i
know
you
are
wise
and
good
you
must
have
a
reason
for
what
you
are
doing
let
it
seem
ever
so
unreasonable
talk
we
like
old
friends
why
are
you
buried
alive
margaret
to
escape
temptation
my
impious
ire
against
those
two
had
its
root
in
the
heart
that
heart
then
i
must
deaden
and
dei
gratia
i
shall
shall
i
a
servant
of
christ
and
of
the
church
court
temptation
shall
i
pray
daily
to
be
led
out
o
and
walk
into
it
with
open
eyes
that
is
good
sense
anyway
said
margaret
with
a
consummate
affectation
of
candour
is
unanswerable
said
clement
with
a
sigh
we
shall
see
tell
me
have
you
escaped
temptation
here
why
i
ask
is
when
i
am
alone
my
thoughts
are
far
more
wild
and
foolish
than
in
company
nay
speak
sooth
come
i
must
needs
own
i
have
been
worse
tempted
here
with
evil
imaginations
than
in
the
there
ay
but
so
were
anthony
and
jerome
macarius
and
hilarion
benedict
bernard
and
all
the
saints
wear
how
do
you
know
i
feel
sure
it
guessing
against
knowledge
here
is
men
folk
are
sillier
than
us
that
be
but
women
wise
in
their
own
conceits
they
will
not
let
themselves
see
their
stomachs
are
too
high
to
be
taught
by
their
eyes
a
woman
if
she
went
into
a
hole
in
a
bank
to
escape
temptation
and
there
found
it
would
just
lift
her
farthingale
and
out
o
and
not
know
how
wise
she
was
till
she
watched
a
man
in
like
nay
i
grant
humility
and
a
teachable
spirit
are
the
roads
to
wisdom
but
when
all
is
said
here
i
wrestle
but
with
imagination
at
gouda
she
i
love
as
no
priest
or
monk
must
love
any
but
the
angels
she
will
tempt
a
weak
soul
unwilling
yet
not
loth
to
be
ay
that
is
another
matter
i
should
tempt
thee
then
to
what
i
name
who
knows
the
flesh
is
speak
for
yourself
my
lad
why
you
are
thinking
of
some
other
margaret
not
margaret
a
peter
was
ever
my
mind
turned
to
folly
and
frailty
stay
is
it
because
you
were
my
husband
once
as
these
lines
avouch
think
you
the
road
to
folly
is
beaten
for
you
more
than
another
oh
how
shallow
are
the
wise
and
how
little
able
are
you
to
read
me
who
can
read
you
so
well
from
top
to
toe
come
learn
thine
a
b
were
a
stranger
to
proffer
me
unchaste
love
i
should
shrink
a
bit
no
doubt
and
feel
sore
but
i
should
defend
myself
without
making
a
coil
for
men
i
know
are
so
the
best
of
them
sometimes
but
if
you
that
have
been
my
husband
and
are
my
child
father
were
to
offer
to
humble
me
so
in
mine
own
eyes
and
thine
and
his
either
i
should
spit
in
thy
face
gerard
or
as
i
am
not
a
downright
vulgar
woman
i
should
snatch
the
first
weapon
at
hand
and
strike
thee
and
margaret
eyes
flashed
fire
and
her
nostrils
expanded
that
it
was
glorious
to
see
and
no
one
that
did
see
her
could
doubt
her
sincerity
i
had
not
the
sense
to
see
that
said
gerard
quietly
and
he
pondered
margaret
eyed
him
in
silence
and
soon
recovered
her
composure
let
not
you
and
i
dispute
said
she
gently
speak
we
of
other
things
ask
me
of
thy
my
father
well
and
warms
to
thee
and
me
poor
soul
a
drew
glaive
on
those
twain
that
day
but
jorian
ketel
and
i
we
mastered
him
and
he
drove
them
forth
his
house
for
that
may
not
be
he
must
take
them
that
he
will
never
do
for
us
you
know
the
man
he
is
dour
as
iron
yet
would
he
do
it
for
one
word
from
one
that
will
not
speak
who
the
vicar
of
gouda
the
old
man
will
be
at
the
manse
i
how
you
come
back
to
forgive
me
i
am
but
a
woman
it
is
us
for
nagging
shouldst
keep
me
from
it
wi
questioning
of
my
sister
kate
alas
what
hath
ill
befallen
that
sweet
lily
out
and
alas
be
calm
sweetheart
no
harm
hath
her
befallen
oh
nay
nay
far
then
margaret
forced
herself
to
be
composed
and
in
a
low
sweet
gentle
voice
she
murmured
to
him
thus
my
poor
gerard
kate
hath
left
her
trouble
behind
her
for
the
manner
o
was
like
the
rest
ah
such
as
she
saw
never
thirty
nor
ever
shall
while
earth
shall
last
she
smiled
in
pain
too
a
well
then
thus
she
was
took
wi
a
languor
and
a
loss
of
all
her
a
loss
of
her
pains
i
understand
you
ay
you
are
not
experienced
indeed
thy
mother
almost
blinded
herself
and
said
maybe
a
change
for
the
better
but
joan
ketel
which
is
an
understanding
woman
she
looked
at
her
and
said
sun
down
wind
and
the
gossips
sided
and
said
brave
you
that
are
her
mother
for
she
is
half
way
to
the
saints
and
thy
mother
wept
sore
but
kate
would
not
let
her
and
one
very
ancient
woman
she
said
to
thy
mother
will
die
as
easy
as
she
lived
hard
and
she
lay
painless
best
part
of
three
days
a
sipping
of
heaven
and
my
dear
when
she
was
just
parting
she
asked
for
little
boy
and
i
brought
him
and
set
him
on
the
bed
and
the
little
thing
behaved
as
peaceably
as
he
does
now
but
by
this
time
she
was
past
speaking
but
she
pointed
to
a
drawer
and
her
mother
knew
what
to
look
for
it
was
two
gold
angels
thou
hadst
given
her
years
ago
poor
soul
she
had
kept
then
till
thou
shouldst
come
home
and
she
nodded
towards
the
little
boy
and
looked
anxious
but
we
understood
her
and
put
the
pieces
in
his
two
hands
and
when
his
little
fingers
closed
on
them
she
smiled
content
and
so
she
gave
her
little
earthly
treasures
to
her
child
for
you
were
her
favourite
and
her
immortal
jewel
to
god
and
passed
so
sweetly
we
none
of
us
knew
justly
when
she
left
us
gerard
wept
she
hath
not
left
her
like
on
earth
he
sobbed
oh
how
the
affections
of
earth
curl
softly
round
my
heart
i
can
not
help
it
god
made
them
after
all
speak
on
sweet
margaret
at
thy
voice
the
past
rolls
its
tides
back
upon
me
the
loves
and
the
hopes
of
youth
come
fair
and
gliding
into
my
dark
cell
and
darker
bosom
on
waves
of
memory
and
gerard
i
am
loth
to
grieve
you
but
kate
cried
a
little
when
she
first
took
ill
at
you
not
being
there
to
close
her
gerard
sighed
you
were
within
a
league
but
hid
your
face
from
he
groaned
there
forgive
me
for
nagging
i
am
but
a
woman
you
would
not
have
been
so
cruel
to
your
own
flesh
and
blood
knowingly
would
you
oh
well
then
know
that
thy
brother
sybrandt
lies
in
my
charge
with
a
broken
back
fruit
of
thy
mea
culpa
mea
culpa
he
is
very
penitent
be
yourself
and
forgive
him
this
i
have
forgiven
him
long
think
you
he
can
believe
that
from
any
mouth
but
yours
come
he
is
but
about
two
butts
length
so
near
why
where
at
gouda
manse
i
took
him
there
yestreen
for
i
know
you
the
curse
was
scarce
cold
on
your
lips
when
you
repented
it
gerard
nodded
assent
and
i
said
to
myself
gerard
will
thank
me
for
taking
sybrandt
to
die
under
his
roof
he
will
not
beat
his
breast
and
cry
mea
culpa
yet
grudge
three
footsteps
to
quiet
a
withered
brother
on
his
last
bed
he
may
have
a
bee
in
his
bonnet
but
he
is
not
a
hypocrite
a
thing
all
pious
words
and
uncharitable
gerard
literally
staggered
where
he
sat
at
this
tremendous
thrust
forgive
me
for
nagging
said
she
thy
mother
too
is
waiting
for
thee
is
it
well
done
to
keep
her
on
thorns
so
long
she
will
not
sleep
this
night
bethink
thee
gerard
she
is
all
to
thee
that
i
am
to
this
sweet
child
ah
i
think
so
much
more
of
mothers
since
i
had
my
little
gerard
she
suffered
for
thee
and
nursed
thee
and
tended
thee
from
boy
to
man
priest
monk
hermit
call
thyself
what
thou
wilt
to
her
thou
art
but
one
thing
her
where
is
she
murmured
gerard
in
a
quavering
voice
at
gouda
manse
wearing
the
night
in
prayer
and
then
margaret
saw
the
time
was
come
for
that
appeal
to
his
reason
she
had
purposely
reserved
till
persuasion
should
have
paved
the
way
for
conviction
so
the
smith
first
softens
the
iron
by
fire
and
then
brings
down
the
sledge
hammer
she
showed
him
but
in
her
own
good
straightforward
dutch
that
his
present
life
was
only
a
higher
kind
of
selfishness
spiritual
egotism
whereas
a
priest
had
no
more
right
to
care
only
for
his
own
soul
than
only
for
his
own
body
that
was
not
his
path
to
heaven
but
said
she
whoever
yet
lost
his
soul
by
saving
the
souls
of
others
the
almighty
loves
him
who
thinks
of
others
and
when
he
shall
see
thee
caring
for
the
souls
of
the
folk
the
duke
hath
put
into
thine
hand
he
will
care
ten
times
more
for
thy
soul
than
he
does
gerard
was
struck
by
this
remark
art
shrewd
in
dispute
said
he
far
from
it
was
the
reply
only
my
eyes
are
not
bandaged
with
conceit
so
long
as
satan
walks
the
whole
earth
tempting
men
and
so
long
as
the
sons
of
belial
do
never
lock
themselves
in
caves
but
run
like
ants
to
and
fro
corrupting
others
the
good
man
that
skulks
apart
plays
the
devil
game
or
at
least
gives
him
the
odds
thou
a
soldier
of
christ
ask
thy
comrade
denys
who
is
but
a
soldier
of
the
duke
ask
him
if
ever
he
skulked
in
a
hole
and
shunned
the
battle
because
forsooth
in
battle
is
danger
as
well
as
glory
and
duty
for
thy
sole
excuse
is
fear
thou
makest
no
secret
o
go
to
no
duke
nor
king
hath
such
cowardly
soldiers
as
christ
hath
what
was
that
you
said
in
the
church
at
rotterdam
about
the
man
in
the
parable
that
buried
his
talent
in
the
earth
and
so
offended
the
giver
thy
wonderful
gift
for
preaching
is
it
not
a
talent
and
a
gift
from
thy
creator
certes
such
as
it
and
hast
thou
laid
it
out
or
buried
it
to
whom
hast
thou
preached
these
seven
months
to
bats
and
owls
hast
buried
it
in
one
hole
with
thyself
and
thy
once
good
wits
the
dominicans
are
the
friars
preachers
is
for
preaching
they
were
founded
so
thou
art
false
to
dominic
as
well
as
to
his
master
do
you
remember
gerard
when
we
were
young
together
which
now
are
old
before
our
time
as
we
walked
handed
in
the
fields
did
you
but
see
a
sheep
cast
ay
three
fields
off
you
would
leave
your
sweetheart
by
her
good
will
and
run
and
lift
the
sheep
for
charity
well
then
at
gouda
is
not
one
sheep
in
evil
plight
but
a
whole
flock
some
cast
some
strayed
some
sick
some
tainted
some
a
being
devoured
and
all
for
the
want
of
a
shepherd
where
is
their
shepherd
lurking
in
a
den
like
a
wolf
a
den
in
his
own
parish
out
fie
out
fie
i
scented
thee
out
in
part
by
thy
kindness
to
the
little
birds
take
note
you
gerard
eliassoen
must
love
something
is
in
your
blood
you
were
born
shunning
man
you
do
but
seek
earthly
affection
a
peg
lower
than
gerard
interrupted
her
the
birds
are
god
creatures
his
innocent
creatures
and
i
do
well
to
love
them
being
god
what
are
they
creatures
of
the
same
god
that
we
are
that
he
is
who
lies
upon
thy
knee
you
know
they
then
what
pretence
for
shunning
us
and
being
kind
to
them
sith
man
is
one
of
the
animals
why
pick
him
out
to
shun
because
he
is
of
animals
the
paragon
what
you
court
the
young
of
birds
and
abandon
your
own
young
birds
need
but
bodily
food
and
having
wings
deserve
scant
pity
if
they
can
not
fly
and
find
it
but
that
sweet
dove
upon
thy
knee
he
needeth
not
carnal
only
but
spiritual
food
he
is
thine
as
well
as
mine
and
i
have
done
my
share
he
will
soon
be
too
much
for
me
and
i
look
to
gouda
parson
to
teach
him
true
piety
and
useful
lore
is
he
not
of
more
value
than
many
sparrows
gerard
started
and
stammered
an
affirmation
for
she
waited
for
his
reply
you
wonder
continued
she
to
hear
me
quote
holy
writ
so
glib
i
have
pored
over
it
this
four
years
and
why
not
because
god
wrote
it
but
because
i
saw
it
often
in
thy
hands
ere
thou
didst
leave
me
heaven
forgive
me
i
am
but
a
woman
what
thinkest
thou
of
this
sentence
your
work
so
shine
before
men
that
they
may
see
your
good
works
and
glorify
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
what
is
a
saint
in
a
sink
better
than
light
under
a
bushel
therefore
since
the
sheep
committed
to
thy
charge
bleat
for
thee
and
cry
desert
us
no
longer
but
come
to
gouda
manse
since
i
who
know
thee
ten
times
better
than
thou
knowest
thyself
do
pledge
my
soul
it
is
for
thy
soul
weal
to
go
to
gouda
manse
since
duty
to
thy
child
too
long
abandoned
calls
thee
to
gouda
manse
since
thy
sovereign
whom
holy
writ
again
bids
thee
honour
sends
thee
to
gouda
manse
since
the
pope
whom
the
church
teaches
thee
to
revere
hath
absolved
thee
of
thy
monkish
vows
and
orders
thee
to
gouda
manse
ah
since
thy
mother
watches
for
thee
in
dole
and
care
and
turneth
oft
the
and
sigheth
sore
that
thou
comest
so
slow
to
her
at
gouda
manse
since
thy
brother
withered
by
thy
curse
awaits
thy
forgiveness
and
thy
prayers
for
his
soul
now
lingering
in
his
body
at
gouda
manse
take
thou
in
thine
arms
the
sweet
bird
wi
crest
of
gold
that
nestles
to
thy
bosom
and
give
me
thy
hand
thy
sweetheart
erst
and
wife
and
now
thy
friend
the
truest
friend
to
thee
this
night
that
ere
man
had
and
come
with
me
to
gouda
manse
it
is
the
voice
of
an
angel
cried
clement
loudly
then
hearken
it
and
come
forth
to
gouda
manse
the
battle
was
won
margaret
lingered
behind
cast
her
eye
rapidly
round
the
furniture
and
selected
the
vulgate
and
the
psaltery
the
rest
she
sighed
at
and
let
it
lie
the
breastplate
and
the
cilice
of
bristles
she
took
and
dashed
with
feeble
ferocity
on
the
floor
then
seeing
gerard
watch
her
with
surprise
from
the
outside
she
coloured
and
said
i
am
but
a
woman
will
still
be
why
encumber
thyself
with
those
they
are
oh
she
had
a
and
with
this
they
took
the
road
to
gouda
parsonage
the
moon
and
stars
were
so
bright
it
seemed
almost
as
light
as
day
suddenly
gerard
stopped
my
poor
little
birds
what
of
them
they
will
miss
their
food
i
feed
them
every
the
child
hath
a
piece
of
bread
in
his
cowl
take
that
and
feed
them
now
against
the
i
will
nay
i
will
not
he
is
as
innocent
and
nearer
to
me
and
to
margaret
drew
a
long
breath
is
well
hadst
taken
it
i
might
have
hated
thee
i
am
but
a
when
they
had
gone
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
gerard
sighed
margaret
said
he
i
must
rest
he
is
too
heavy
for
then
give
him
me
and
take
thou
these
alas
alas
i
mind
when
thou
wouldst
have
run
with
the
child
on
one
shoulder
and
the
mother
on
and
margaret
carried
the
boy
i
trow
said
gerard
looking
down
overmuch
fasting
is
not
good
for
a
a
many
die
of
it
each
year
winter
time
replied
margaret
gerard
pondered
these
simple
words
and
eyed
her
askant
carrying
the
child
with
perfect
ease
when
they
had
gone
nearly
a
mile
he
said
with
considerable
surprise
you
thought
it
was
but
two
butts
not
why
you
said
that
is
another
she
then
turned
on
him
the
face
of
a
madonna
i
lied
said
she
sweetly
and
to
save
your
soul
and
body
i
maybe
tell
a
worse
lie
than
that
at
need
i
am
but
a
woman
ah
well
it
is
but
two
butts
length
from
here
at
any
without
a
lie
humph
three
without
a
and
sure
enough
in
a
few
minutes
they
came
up
to
the
manse
a
candle
was
burning
in
the
vicar
parlour
she
is
waking
still
whispered
margaret
beautiful
beautiful
said
clement
and
stopped
to
look
at
it
what
in
heaven
name
that
little
candle
seen
through
the
window
at
night
look
an
it
be
not
like
some
fair
star
of
size
prodigious
it
delighteth
the
eyes
and
warmeth
the
heart
of
those
come
and
i
show
thee
something
better
said
margaret
and
led
him
on
tiptoe
to
the
window
they
looked
in
and
there
was
catherine
kneeling
on
the
hassock
with
her
hours
before
her
folk
can
pray
out
of
a
cave
whispered
margaret
ay
and
hit
heaven
with
their
prayers
for
is
for
a
sight
of
thee
she
prayeth
and
thou
art
here
now
gerard
be
prepared
she
is
not
the
woman
you
knew
her
her
children
troubles
have
greatly
broken
the
brisk
soul
and
i
see
she
has
been
weeping
now
she
will
have
given
thee
up
being
so
let
me
get
to
her
said
clement
hastily
trembling
all
over
that
door
i
will
bide
when
gerard
was
gone
to
the
door
margaret
fearing
the
sudden
surprise
gave
one
sharp
tap
at
the
window
and
cried
mother
in
a
loud
expressive
voice
that
catherine
read
at
once
she
clasped
her
hands
together
and
had
half
risen
from
her
kneeling
posture
when
the
door
burst
open
and
clement
flung
himself
wildly
on
his
knees
at
her
knees
with
his
arms
out
to
embrace
her
she
uttered
a
cry
such
as
only
a
mother
could
ah
my
darling
my
darling
and
clung
sobbing
round
his
neck
and
true
it
was
she
saw
neither
a
hermit
a
priest
nor
a
monk
but
just
her
child
lost
and
despaired
of
and
in
her
arms
and
after
a
little
while
margaret
came
in
with
wet
eyes
and
cheeks
and
a
holy
calm
of
affection
settled
by
degrees
on
these
sore
troubled
ones
and
they
sat
all
three
together
hand
in
hand
murmuring
sweet
and
loving
converse
and
he
who
sat
in
the
middle
drank
right
and
left
their
true
affection
and
their
humble
but
genuine
wisdom
and
was
forced
to
eat
a
good
nourishing
meal
and
at
daybreak
was
packed
off
to
a
snowy
bed
and
by
and
by
awoke
as
from
a
hideous
dream
friar
and
hermit
no
more
clement
no
more
but
gerard
eliassoen
parson
of
gouda
i
think
she
means
prejudice
chapter
xcvi
margaret
went
back
to
rotterdam
long
ere
gerard
awoke
and
actually
left
her
boy
behind
her
she
sent
the
faithful
sturdy
reicht
off
to
gouda
directly
with
a
vicar
grey
frock
and
large
felt
hat
and
with
minute
instructions
how
to
govern
her
new
master
then
she
went
to
jorian
ketel
for
she
said
to
herself
he
is
the
closest
i
ever
met
so
he
is
the
man
for
me
and
in
concert
with
him
she
did
two
mortal
sly
things
yet
not
in
my
opinion
virulent
though
she
thought
they
were
but
if
i
am
asked
what
were
these
deeds
without
a
name
the
answer
is
that
as
she
who
was
a
woman
kept
them
secret
till
her
dying
day
i
who
am
a
man
verbum
non
amplius
she
kept
away
from
gouda
parsonage
things
that
pass
little
noticed
in
the
heat
of
argument
sometimes
rankle
afterwards
and
when
she
came
to
go
over
all
that
had
passed
she
was
offended
at
gerard
thinking
she
could
ever
forget
the
priest
in
the
some
time
lover
for
what
did
he
take
me
said
she
and
this
raised
a
great
shyness
which
really
she
would
not
otherwise
have
felt
being
downright
innocent
and
pride
sided
with
modesty
and
whispered
go
no
more
to
gouda
she
left
little
gerard
there
to
complete
the
conquest
her
maternal
heart
ascribed
to
him
not
to
her
own
eloquence
and
sagacity
and
to
anchor
his
father
for
ever
to
humanity
but
this
generous
stroke
of
policy
cost
her
heart
dear
she
had
never
yet
been
parted
from
her
boy
an
hour
and
she
felt
sadly
strange
as
well
as
desolate
without
him
after
the
first
day
it
became
intolerable
and
what
does
the
poor
soul
do
but
creep
at
dark
up
to
gouda
parsonage
and
lurk
about
the
premises
like
a
thief
till
she
saw
reicht
heynes
in
the
kitchen
alone
then
she
tapped
softly
at
the
window
and
said
reicht
for
pity
sake
bring
him
out
to
me
with
margaret
the
person
who
occupied
her
thoughts
at
the
time
ceased
to
have
a
name
and
sank
to
a
pronoun
reicht
soon
found
an
excuse
for
taking
little
gerard
out
and
there
was
a
scene
of
mutual
rapture
followed
by
mutual
tears
when
mother
and
boy
parted
again
and
it
was
arranged
that
reicht
should
take
him
half
way
to
rotterdam
every
day
at
a
set
hour
and
margaret
meet
them
and
at
these
meetings
after
the
raptures
and
after
mother
and
child
had
gambolled
together
like
a
young
cat
and
her
first
kitten
the
boy
would
sometimes
amuse
himself
alone
at
their
feet
and
the
two
women
generally
seized
this
opportunity
to
talk
very
seriously
about
luke
peterson
this
began
thus
reicht
said
margaret
i
as
good
as
promised
him
to
marry
luke
peterson
you
the
word
quoth
i
i
wed
him
poor
luke
prithee
why
poor
luke
to
be
bandied
about
so
atwixt
yea
and
why
reicht
you
have
not
ever
been
so
simple
as
to
cast
an
eye
of
affection
on
the
boy
that
you
take
his
part
me
said
reicht
with
a
toss
of
the
head
oh
i
ask
your
pardon
well
then
you
can
do
me
a
good
whisht
whisper
that
little
darling
is
listening
to
every
word
and
eyes
like
on
this
both
their
heads
would
have
gone
under
one
cap
two
women
plotting
against
one
boy
oh
you
great
cowardly
serpents
but
when
these
stolen
meetings
had
gone
on
for
about
five
days
margaret
began
to
feel
the
injustice
of
it
and
to
be
irritated
as
well
as
unhappy
and
she
was
crying
about
it
when
a
cart
came
to
her
door
and
in
it
clean
as
a
new
penny
his
beard
close
shaved
his
hands
white
as
snow
and
a
little
colour
in
his
pale
face
sat
the
vicar
of
gouda
in
the
grey
frock
and
large
felt
hat
she
had
sent
him
she
ran
upstairs
directly
and
washed
away
all
traces
of
her
tears
and
put
on
a
cap
which
being
just
taken
out
of
the
drawer
was
cleaner
theoretically
than
the
one
she
had
on
and
came
down
to
him
he
seized
both
her
hands
and
kissed
them
and
a
tear
fell
upon
them
she
turned
her
head
away
at
that
to
hide
her
own
which
started
my
sweet
margaret
he
cried
why
is
this
why
hold
you
aloof
from
your
own
good
deed
we
have
been
waiting
for
you
every
day
and
no
you
said
what
when
i
was
a
hermit
and
a
ay
no
matter
you
said
things
and
you
had
no
forget
all
i
said
there
who
hearkens
the
ravings
of
a
maniac
for
i
see
now
that
in
a
few
months
more
i
should
have
been
a
gibbering
idiot
yet
no
mortal
could
have
persuaded
me
away
but
you
oh
what
an
outlay
of
wit
and
goodness
was
yours
but
it
is
not
here
i
can
thank
and
bless
you
as
i
ought
no
it
is
in
the
home
you
have
given
me
among
the
sheep
whose
shepherd
you
have
made
me
already
i
love
them
dearly
there
it
is
i
must
thank
truest
friend
ever
man
had
so
now
i
say
to
you
as
erst
you
said
to
me
come
to
gouda
humph
we
will
see
about
why
margaret
think
you
i
had
ever
kept
the
dear
child
so
long
but
that
i
made
sure
you
would
be
back
to
him
from
day
to
day
oh
he
curls
round
my
very
heartstrings
but
what
is
my
title
to
him
compared
to
thine
confess
now
thou
hast
had
hard
thoughts
of
me
for
nay
nay
not
ah
thou
art
thyself
again
wast
ever
thoughtful
of
others
i
have
half
a
mind
to
go
to
gouda
manse
for
your
saying
come
then
with
half
thy
mind
is
worth
the
whole
of
other
well
i
dare
say
i
will
but
there
is
no
such
mighty
hurry
said
she
coolly
she
was
literally
burning
to
go
tell
me
first
how
you
agree
with
your
why
already
my
poor
have
taken
root
in
my
i
thought
as
and
there
are
such
good
creatures
among
them
simple
and
rough
and
superstitious
but
wonderfully
oh
i
leave
you
alone
for
seeing
a
grain
of
good
among
a
bushel
of
whisht
whisht
and
margaret
two
of
them
have
been
ill
friends
for
four
years
and
came
to
the
manse
each
to
get
on
my
blind
side
but
give
the
glory
to
god
i
got
on
their
bright
side
and
made
them
friends
and
laugh
at
themselves
for
their
but
are
you
in
very
deed
their
vicar
answer
me
certes
have
i
not
been
to
the
bishop
and
taken
the
oath
and
rung
the
church
bell
and
touched
the
altar
the
missal
and
the
holy
cup
before
the
and
they
have
handed
me
the
parish
seal
see
here
it
is
nay
is
a
real
vicar
inviting
a
true
friend
to
gouda
then
my
mind
is
at
ease
tell
me
oceans
well
sweet
one
nearest
to
me
of
all
my
parish
is
a
poor
cripple
that
my
guardian
angel
and
his
her
name
thou
knowest
even
by
this
turning
of
thy
head
away
hath
placed
beneath
my
roof
sybrandt
and
i
are
that
we
never
were
till
now
brothers
gladden
thee
yet
sadden
thee
to
hear
how
we
kissed
and
forgave
one
another
he
is
full
of
thy
praises
and
wholly
in
a
pious
mind
he
says
he
is
happier
since
his
trouble
than
he
was
in
the
days
of
his
strength
oh
out
of
my
house
he
shall
go
to
any
place
but
tell
me
somewhat
that
happened
thyself
poor
soul
all
this
is
good
but
yet
no
tidings
to
me
do
i
not
know
thee
of
old
well
let
me
see
at
first
i
was
much
dazzled
by
the
and
could
not
go
abroad
owl
but
that
is
passed
and
good
reicht
heynes
humph
what
of
her
this
to
thine
ear
only
for
she
is
a
diamond
her
voice
goes
through
me
like
a
knife
and
all
voices
seem
loud
but
thine
which
is
so
mellow
sweet
stay
now
i
fit
ye
with
tidings
i
spake
yesterday
with
an
old
man
that
conceits
he
is
and
sweats
to
pass
for
such
with
others
but
oh
so
threadbare
and
the
best
good
heart
why
is
a
parish
of
angels
said
margaret
ironically
then
why
dost
thou
keep
out
o
retorted
gerard
well
he
was
telling
me
there
was
no
parish
in
holland
where
the
devil
hath
such
power
as
at
gouda
and
among
his
instances
says
he
had
a
hermit
the
holiest
in
holland
but
being
gouda
the
devil
came
for
him
this
week
and
took
him
bag
and
baggage
not
a
of
him
left
but
a
goodish
piece
of
his
skin
just
for
all
the
world
like
a
hedgehog
and
a
piece
o
old
iron
furbished
up
margaret
smiled
ay
but
continued
gerard
the
strange
thing
is
the
cave
has
verily
fallen
in
and
had
i
been
so
perverse
as
resist
thee
it
had
assuredly
buried
me
dead
there
where
i
had
buried
myself
alive
therefore
in
this
i
see
the
finger
of
providence
condemning
my
late
approving
my
present
way
of
life
what
sayest
thou
nay
can
i
pierce
the
like
mysteries
i
am
but
a
somewhat
more
methinks
this
very
tale
proves
thee
my
guardian
angel
and
all
else
avouches
it
so
come
to
gouda
well
go
you
on
i
nay
in
the
cart
with
not
why
can
i
tell
why
and
wherefore
being
a
woman
all
i
know
is
i
seem
to
feel
to
wish
to
come
so
be
it
then
i
leave
thee
the
cart
being
as
thou
sayest
a
woman
and
i
go
being
a
man
again
with
the
joyful
tidings
of
thy
when
margaret
reached
the
manse
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
the
two
gerards
together
the
son
performing
his
capriccios
on
the
plot
and
the
father
slouching
on
a
chair
in
his
great
hat
with
pencil
and
paper
trying
very
patiently
to
sketch
him
after
a
warm
welcome
he
showed
her
his
attempts
but
in
vain
i
strive
to
fix
him
said
he
for
he
is
incarnate
quick
silver
yet
do
but
note
his
changes
infinite
but
none
ungracious
all
is
supple
and
easy
and
how
he
melteth
from
one
posture
to
another
he
added
presently
woe
to
illuminators
i
looking
on
thee
sir
baby
i
see
what
awkward
lopsided
ungainly
toads
i
and
my
fellows
painted
missals
with
and
called
them
cherubs
and
seraphs
finally
he
threw
the
paper
away
in
despair
and
margaret
conveyed
it
secretly
into
her
bosom
at
night
when
they
sat
round
the
peat
fire
he
bade
them
observe
how
beautiful
the
brass
candlesticks
and
other
glittering
metals
were
in
the
glow
from
the
hearth
catherine
eyes
sparkled
at
this
observation
and
oh
the
sheets
i
lie
in
here
said
he
often
my
conscience
pricketh
me
and
saith
art
thou
to
lie
in
lint
like
web
of
snow
dives
was
so
flaxed
as
i
and
to
think
that
there
are
folk
in
the
world
that
have
all
the
beautiful
things
which
i
have
here
yet
not
content
let
them
pass
six
months
in
a
hermit
cell
seeing
no
face
of
man
then
will
they
find
how
lovely
and
pleasant
this
wicked
world
is
and
eke
that
men
and
women
are
god
fairest
creatures
margaret
was
always
fair
but
never
to
my
eye
so
bright
as
margaret
shook
her
head
incredulously
gerard
continued
my
mother
was
ever
good
and
kind
but
i
noted
not
her
exceeding
comeliness
till
nor
i
neither
said
catherine
a
score
years
ago
i
might
pass
in
a
crowd
but
not
gerard
declared
to
her
that
each
age
had
its
beauty
see
this
mild
grey
eye
said
he
that
hath
looked
motherly
love
upon
so
many
of
us
all
that
love
hath
left
its
shadow
and
that
shadow
is
a
beauty
which
defieth
time
see
this
delicate
lip
these
pure
white
teeth
see
this
brow
where
comliness
just
passeth
into
reverence
art
beautiful
in
my
eyes
mother
and
that
is
enough
for
me
my
darling
is
time
you
were
in
bed
child
ye
have
to
preach
the
and
reicht
heynes
and
catherine
interchanged
a
look
which
said
we
two
have
an
amiable
maniac
to
superintend
calls
everything
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
they
heard
him
preach
in
his
own
church
it
was
crammed
with
persons
who
came
curious
but
remained
devout
never
was
his
wonderful
gift
displayed
more
powerfully
he
was
himself
deeply
moved
by
the
first
sight
of
all
his
people
and
his
bowels
yearned
over
this
flock
he
had
so
long
neglected
in
a
single
sermon
which
lasted
two
hours
and
seemed
to
last
but
twenty
minutes
he
declared
the
whole
scripture
he
terrified
the
impenitent
and
thoughtless
confirmed
the
wavering
consoled
the
bereaved
and
the
afflicted
uplifted
the
heart
of
the
poor
and
when
he
ended
left
the
multitude
standing
rapt
and
unwilling
to
believe
the
divine
music
of
his
voice
and
soul
had
ceased
need
i
say
that
two
poor
women
in
a
corner
sat
entranced
with
streaming
eyes
wherever
gat
he
it
all
whispered
catherine
with
her
apron
to
her
eyes
by
our
lady
not
from
as
soon
as
they
were
by
themselves
margaret
threw
her
arms
round
catherine
neck
and
kissed
her
mother
mother
i
am
not
quite
a
happy
woman
but
oh
i
am
a
proud
and
she
vowed
on
her
knees
never
by
word
or
deed
to
let
her
love
come
between
this
young
saint
and
heaven
reader
did
you
ever
stand
by
the
seashore
after
a
storm
when
the
wind
happens
to
have
gone
down
suddenly
the
waves
can
not
cease
with
their
cause
indeed
they
seem
at
first
to
the
ear
to
lash
the
sounding
shore
more
fiercely
than
while
the
wind
blew
still
we
are
conscious
that
inevitable
calm
has
begun
and
is
now
but
rocking
them
to
sleep
so
it
was
with
those
true
and
lovers
from
that
eventful
night
when
they
went
hand
in
hand
beneath
the
stars
from
gouda
hermitage
to
gouda
manse
at
times
a
loud
wave
would
every
now
and
then
come
roaring
but
it
was
only
memory
echo
of
the
tempest
that
had
swept
their
lives
the
storm
itself
was
over
and
the
boiling
waters
began
from
that
moment
to
go
down
down
down
gently
but
inevitably
this
image
is
to
supply
the
place
of
interminable
details
that
would
be
tedious
and
tame
what
best
merits
attention
at
present
is
the
general
situation
and
the
strange
complication
of
feeling
that
arose
from
it
history
itself
though
a
far
more
daring
than
romance
presents
few
things
so
strange
as
the
footing
on
which
gerard
and
margaret
now
lived
for
many
years
united
by
present
affection
past
familiarity
and
a
marriage
irregular
but
legal
separated
by
holy
church
and
by
their
own
consciences
which
sided
unreservedly
with
holy
church
separated
by
the
church
but
united
by
a
living
pledge
of
affection
lawful
in
every
sense
at
its
date
and
living
but
a
few
miles
from
one
another
and
she
calling
his
mother
mother
for
some
years
she
always
took
her
boy
to
gouda
on
sunday
returning
home
at
dark
go
when
she
would
it
was
always
fete
at
gouda
manse
and
she
was
received
like
a
little
queen
catherine
in
these
days
was
nearly
always
with
her
and
eli
very
often
tergou
had
so
little
to
tempt
them
compared
with
rotterdam
and
at
last
they
left
it
altogether
and
set
up
in
the
capital
and
thus
the
years
glided
so
barren
now
of
striking
incidents
so
void
of
great
hopes
and
free
from
great
fears
and
so
like
one
another
that
without
the
help
of
dates
i
could
scarcely
indicate
the
progress
of
time
however
early
next
year
the
duchess
of
burgundy
with
the
open
dissent
but
secret
connivance
of
the
duke
raised
forces
to
enable
her
dethroned
brother
edward
the
fourth
of
england
to
invade
that
kingdom
our
old
friend
denys
thus
enlisted
and
passing
through
rotterdam
to
the
ships
heard
on
his
way
that
gerard
was
a
priest
and
margaret
alone
on
this
he
told
margaret
that
marriage
was
not
a
habit
of
his
but
that
as
his
comrade
had
put
it
out
of
his
own
power
to
keep
troth
he
felt
bound
to
offer
to
keep
it
for
him
for
a
comrade
honour
is
dear
to
us
as
our
own
said
he
she
stared
then
smiled
i
choose
rather
to
be
still
thy

she
closer
acquainted
we
might
not
agree
so
well
and
in
her
character

she
equipped
him
with
a
new
sword
of
antwerp

and
a
double
handful
of
silver

she
for

thrown
away
as
quick
as
silver
and
harder
to
win
back

thee
safe
out
of
all
thy
perils

famous
fair
women
yonder
to
beguile
thee
with
their

well
as

he
was
hurried
on
board
at
la
vere
and
never
saw
gerard
at
that
time
in
sybrandt
began
to
fail
his
pitiable
existence
had
been
sweetened
by
his
brother
inventive
tenderness
and
his
own
contented
spirit
which
his
antecedents
considered
was
truly
remarkable
as
for
gerard
the
day
never
passed
that
he
did
not
devote
two
hours
to
him
reading
or
singing
to
him
praying
with
him
and
drawing
him
about
in
a
soft
carriage
margaret
and
he
had
made
between
them
when
the
poor
soul
found
his
end
near
he
begged
margaret
might
be
sent
for
she
came
at
once
and
almost
with
his
last
breath
he
sought
once
more
that
forgiveness
she
had
long
ago
accorded
she
remained
by
him
till
the
last
and
he
died
blessing
and
blessed
in
the
arms
of
the
two
true
lovers
he
had
parted
for
life
tantum
religio
scit
suadere
boni
there
was
a
wedding
in
margaret
house
luke
peterson
and
reicht
heynes
this
may
seem
less
strange
if
i
give
the
purport
of
the
dialogue
interrupted
some
time
back
margaret
went
on
to
say
then
in
that
case
you
can
easily
make
him
fancy
you
and
for
my
sake
you
must
for
my
conscience
it
pricketh
me
and
i
must
needs
fit
him
with
a
wife
the
best
i
margaret
then
instructed
reicht
to
be
always
kind
and
to
luke
and
she
would
be
a
model
of
peevishness
to
him
but
be
not
thou
so
simple
as
run
me
down
said
she
leave
that
to
me
make
thou
excuses
for
me
i
will
make
myself
black
reicht
received
these
instructions
like
an
order
to
sweep
a
room
and
obeyed
them
punctually
when
they
had
subjected
poor
luke
to
this
double
artillery
for
a
couple
of
years
he
got
to
look
upon
margaret
as
his
fog
and
wind
and
reicht
as
his
sunshine
and
his
affections
transferred
themselves
he
scarce
knew
how
or
when
on
the
wedding
day
reicht
embraced
margaret
and
thanked
her
almost
with
tears
he
was
always
my
fancy
said
she
from
the
first
hour
i
clapped
eyes
on
heyday
you
never
told
me
that
what
reicht
are
you
as
sly
as
the
rest
nay
nay
said
reicht
eagerly
but
i
never
thought
you
would
really
part
with
him
to
me
in
my
country
the
mistress
looks
to
be
served
before
the
margaret
settled
them
in
her
shop
and
gave
them
half
the
profits
and
were
years
of
great
trouble
to
gerard
whose
conscience
compelled
him
to
oppose
the
pope
his
holiness
siding
with
the
grey
friars
in
their
determination
to
swamp
every
palpable
distinction
between
the
virgin
mary
and
her
son
bribed
the
christian
world
into
his
crotchet
by
proffering
pardon
of
all
sins
to
such
as
would
add
to
the
ave
mary
this
clause
and
blessed
be
thy
mother
anna
from
whom
without
blot
of
sin
proceeded
thy
virgin
gerard
in
common
with
many
of
the
northern
clergy
held
this
sentence
to
be
flat
heresy
he
not
only
refused
to
utter
it
in
his
church
but
warned
his
parishioners
against
using
it
in
private
and
he
refused
to
celebrate
the
new
feast
the
pope
invented
at
the
same
time
the
feast
of
the
miraculous
conception
of
the
but
this
drew
upon
him
the
bitter
enmity
of
the
franciscans
and
they
were
strong
enough
to
put
him
into
more
than
one
serious
difficulty
and
inflict
many
a
little
mortification
on
him
in
emergencies
he
consulted
margaret
and
she
always
did
one
of
two
things
either
she
said
i
do
not
see
my
way
and
refused
to
guess
or
else
she
gave
him
advice
that
proved
wonderfully
sagacious
he
had
genius
but
she
had
marvellous
tact
and
where
affection
came
in
and
annihilated
the
woman
judgment
he
stepped
in
his
turn
to
her
aid
thus
though
she
knew
she
was
spoiling
little
gerard
and
catherine
was
ruining
him
for
life
she
would
not
part
with
him
but
kept
him
at
home
and
his
abilities
uncultivated
and
there
was
a
shrewd
boy
of
nine
years
instead
of
learning
to
work
and
obey
playing
about
and
learning
selfishness
from
their
infinite
unselfishness
and
tyrannizing
with
a
rod
of
iron
over
two
women
both
of
them
sagacious
and
spirited
but
reduced
by
their
fondness
for
him
to
the
exact
level
of
idiots
gerard
saw
this
with
pain
and
interfered
with
mild
but
firm
remonstrance
and
after
a
considerable
struggle
prevailed
and
got
little
gerard
sent
to
the
best
school
in
europe
kept
by
one
haaghe
at
deventer
this
was
in
many
tears
were
shed
but
the
great
progress
the
boy
made
at
that
famous
school
reconciled
margaret
in
some
degree
and
the
fidelity
of
reicht
heynes
now
her
partner
in
business
enabled
her
to
spend
weeks
at
a
time
hovering
over
her
boy
at
deventer
and
so
the
years
glided
and
these
two
persons
subjected
to
as
strong
and
constant
a
temptation
as
can
well
be
conceived
were
each
guardian
angels
and
not
each
other
tempters
to
be
sure
the
morality
of
the
next
century
which
taught
that
solemn
vows
to
god
are
sacred
in
proportion
as
they
are
reasonable
had
at
that
time
entered
no
single
mind
and
the
alternative
to
these
two
minds
was
or
sacrilege
it
was
a
strange
thing
to
hear
them
talk
with
unrestrained
tenderness
to
one
another
of
their
boy
and
an
icy
barrier
between
themselves
all
the
time
eight
years
had
now
passed
thus
and
gerard
fairly
compared
with
men
in
general
was
happy
but
margaret
was
not
the
habitual
expression
of
her
face
was
a
sweet
pensiveness
but
sometimes
she
was
irritable
and
a
little
petulant
she
even
snapped
gerard
now
and
then
and
when
she
went
to
see
him
if
a
monk
was
with
him
she
would
turn
her
back
and
go
home
she
hated
the
monks
for
having
parted
gerard
and
her
and
she
inoculated
her
boy
with
a
contempt
for
them
which
lasted
him
till
his
dying
day
gerard
bore
with
her
like
an
angel
he
knew
her
heart
of
gold
and
hoped
this
ill
gust
would
blow
over
he
himself
being
now
the
right
man
in
the
right
place
this
many
years
loving
his
parishioners
and
beloved
by
them
and
occupied
from
morn
till
night
in
good
works
recovered
the
natural
cheerfulness
of
his
disposition
to
tell
the
truth
a
part
of
his
jocoseness
was
a
blind
he
was
the
greatest
except
harmony
in
the
play
that
ever
was
born
he
reconciled
more
enemies
in
ten
years
than
his
predecessors
had
done
in
three
hundred
and
one
of
his
manoeuvres
in
the
peacemaking
art
was
to
make
the
quarrellers
laugh
at
the
cause
of
quarrel
so
did
he
undermine
the
demon
of
discord
but
independently
of
that
he
really
loved
a
harmless
joke
he
was
a
wonderful
tamer
of
animals
squirrels
bares
fawns
etc
so
half
in
jest
a
parishioner
who
had
a
mule
supposed
to
be
possessed
with
a
devil
gave
it
him
and
said
tame
this
vagabone
parson
if
ye
well
in
about
six
months
heaven
knows
how
he
not
only
tamed
jack
but
won
his
affections
to
such
a
degree
that
jack
would
come
running
to
his
whistle
like
a
dog
one
day
having
taken
shelter
from
a
shower
on
the
stone
settle
outside
a
certain
he
heard
a
toper
inside
a
stranger
boasting
he
could
take
more
at
a
draught
than
any
man
in
gouda
he
instantly
marched
in
and
said
what
lads
do
none
of
ye
take
him
up
for
the
honour
of
gouda
shall
it
be
said
that
there
came
hither
one
from
another
parish
a
greater
sot
than
any
of
us
nay
then
i
your
parson
do
take
him
up
go
to
i
find
thee
a
parishioner
shall
drink
more
at
a
draught
than
a
bet
was
made
gerard
whistled
in
clattered
jack
for
he
was
taught
to
come
into
a
room
with
the
utmost
composure
and
put
his
nose
into
his
backer
hand
a
pair
of
buckets
shouted
gerard
and
let
us
see
which
of
these
two
sons
of
asses
can
drink
most
at
a
on
another
occasion
two
farmers
had
a
dispute
whose
hay
was
the
best
failing
to
convince
each
other
they
said
we
ask
parson
for
by
this
time
he
was
their
referee
in
every
mortal
thing
how
lucky
you
thought
of
me
said
gerard
why
i
have
got
one
staying
with
me
who
is
the
best
judge
of
hay
in
holland
bring
me
a
double
handful
so
when
they
came
he
had
them
into
the
parlour
and
put
each
bundle
on
a
chair
then
he
whistled
and
in
walked
jack
lord
a
mercy
said
one
of
the
farmers
jack
said
the
parson
in
the
tone
of
conversation
just
tell
us
which
is
the
best
hay
of
these
jack
sniffed
them
both
and
made
his
choice
directly
proving
his
sincerity
by
eating
every
morsel
the
farmers
slapped
their
thighs
and
scratched
their
heads
to
think
of
we
not
thinking
o
that
and
they
each
sent
jack
a
truss
so
gerard
got
to
be
called
the
merry
parson
of
gouda
but
margaret
who
like
most
loving
women
had
no
more
sense
of
humour
than
a
took
this
very
what
said
she
to
herself
is
there
nothing
sore
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
that
he
can
go
about
playing
the
zany
she
could
understand
pious
resignation
and
content
but
not
mirth
in
true
lovers
parted
and
whilst
her
woman
nature
was
perturbed
by
this
gust
and
women
seem
more
subject
to
gusts
than
men
came
that
terrible
animal
a
busybody
to
work
upon
her
catherine
saw
she
was
not
happy
and
said
to
her
your
boy
is
gone
from
you
i
would
not
live
alone
all
my
days
if
i
were
he
is
more
alone
than
i
sighed
margaret
oh
a
man
is
a
man
but
a
woman
is
a
woman
you
must
not
think
all
of
him
and
none
of
yourself
near
is
your
kirtle
but
nearer
is
your
smock
besides
he
is
a
priest
and
can
do
no
better
but
you
are
not
a
priest
he
has
got
his
parish
and
his
heart
is
in
that
bethink
thee
time
flies
overstay
not
thy
market
wouldst
not
like
to
have
three
or
four
more
little
darlings
about
thy
knee
now
they
have
robbed
thee
of
poor
little
gerard
and
sent
him
to
yon
nasty
school
and
so
she
worked
upon
a
mind
already
irritated
margaret
had
many
suitors
ready
to
marry
her
at
a
word
or
even
a
look
and
among
them
two
merchants
of
the
better
class
van
schelt
and
oostwagen
take
one
of
those
two
said
catherine
well
i
will
ask
gerard
if
i
may
said
margaret
one
day
with
a
flood
of
tears
for
i
can
not
go
on
the
way
i
why
you
would
never
be
so
simple
as
ask
him
think
you
i
would
be
so
wicked
as
marry
without
his
leave
accordingly
she
actually
went
to
gouda
and
after
hanging
her
head
and
blushing
and
crying
and
saying
she
was
miserable
told
him
his
mother
wished
her
to
marry
one
of
those
two
and
if
he
approved
of
her
marrying
at
all
would
he
use
his
wisdom
and
tell
her
which
he
thought
would
be
the
kindest
to
the
little
gerard
of
those
two
for
herself
she
did
not
care
what
became
of
her
gerard
felt
as
if
she
had
put
a
soft
hand
into
his
body
and
torn
his
heart
out
with
it
but
the
priest
with
a
mighty
effort
mastered
the
man
in
a
voice
scarcely
audible
he
declined
this
responsibility
i
am
not
a
saint
or
a
prophet
said
he
i
might
advise
thee
ill
i
shall
read
the
marriage
service
for
thee
faltered
he
it
is
my
right
no
other
would
pray
for
thee
as
i
should
but
thou
must
choose
for
thyself
and
oh
let
me
see
thee
happy
this
four
months
past
thou
hast
not
been
a
discontented
mind
is
never
happy
said
margaret
she
left
him
and
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
prayed
for
help
from
above
margaret
went
home
pale
and
agitated
mother
said
she
never
mention
it
to
me
again
or
we
shall
he
forbade
you
well
more
shame
for
him
that
is
he
forbid
me
he
did
not
condescend
so
far
he
was
as
noble
as
i
was
paltry
he
would
not
choose
for
me
for
fear
of
choosing
me
an
ill
husband
but
he
would
read
the
service
for
my
groom
and
me
that
was
his
right
oh
mother
what
a
heartless
creature
i
was
well
i
thought
not
he
had
that
much
ah
you
go
by
the
poor
soul
words
but
i
rate
words
as
air
when
the
face
speaketh
to
mine
eye
i
saw
the
priest
and
the
true
lover
in
his
dear
face
and
his
cheek
pale
with
the
strife
and
oh
his
poor
lip
trembled
as
he
said
the
words
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
and
margaret
burst
into
a
violent
passion
of
tears
catherine
groaned
there
give
it
up
without
more
ado
said
she
you
two
are
chained
together
for
life
and
if
god
is
merciful
that
wo
be
for
long
for
what
are
you
neither
maid
wife
nor
give
it
up
said
margaret
that
was
done
long
ago
all
i
think
of
now
is
comforting
him
for
now
i
have
been
and
made
him
unhappy
too
wretch
and
monster
that
i
so
the
next
day
they
both
went
to
gouda
and
gerard
who
had
been
praying
for
resignation
all
this
time
received
her
with
peculiar
tenderness
as
a
treasure
he
was
to
lose
but
she
was
agitated
and
eager
to
let
him
see
without
words
that
she
would
never
marry
and
she
fawned
on
him
like
a
little
dog
to
be
forgiven
and
as
she
was
going
away
she
murmured
forgive
and
forget
i
am
but
a
he
misunderstood
her
and
said
all
i
bargain
for
is
let
me
see
thee
content
for
pity
sake
let
me
not
see
thee
unhappy
as
i
have
this
my
darling
you
never
shall
again
said
margaret
with
streaming
eyes
and
kissed
his
hand
he
misunderstood
this
too
at
first
but
when
month
after
month
passed
and
he
heard
no
more
of
her
marriage
and
she
came
to
gouda
comparatively
cheerful
and
was
even
civil
to
father
ambrose
a
mild
benevolent
monk
from
the
dominican
convent
hard
by
then
he
understood
her
and
one
day
he
invited
her
to
walk
alone
with
him
in
the
sacred
paddock
and
before
i
relate
what
passed
between
them
i
must
give
its
history
when
gerard
had
been
four
or
five
days
at
the
manse
looking
out
of
window
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
mother
margaret
here
is
one
of
my
birds
another
another
four
six
nine
a
miracle
a
miracle
why
how
can
you
tell
your
birds
from
their
fellows
said
catherine
i
know
every
feather
in
their
wings
and
see
there
is
the
little
darling
whose
claw
i
gilt
bless
it
and
presently
his
rapture
took
a
serious
turn
and
he
saw
approbation
in
this
conduct
of
the
birds
as
he
did
in
the
fall
of
the
cave
this
wonderfully
kept
alive
his
friendship
for
animals
and
he
enclosed
a
paddock
and
drove
all
the
sons
of
cain
from
it
with
threats
of
excommunication
on
this
little
spot
of
earth
we
have
no
murder
said
he
he
tamed
leverets
and
partridges
and
little
birds
and
hares
and
he
found
a
squirrel
with
a
broken
leg
he
set
it
with
infinite
difficulty
and
patience
and
during
the
cure
showed
it
repositories
of
acorns
nuts
chestnuts
etc
and
this
squirrel
got
well
and
went
off
but
visited
him
in
hard
weather
and
brought
a
mate
and
next
year
little
squirrels
were
found
to
have
imbibed
their
sentiments
and
of
all
these
animals
each
generation
was
tamer
than
the
last
this
set
the
good
parson
thinking
and
gave
him
the
true
clue
to
the
great
successes
of
mediaeval
hermits
in
taming
wild
animals
he
kept
the
key
of
this
paddock
and
never
let
any
man
but
himself
enter
it
nor
would
he
even
let
little
gerard
go
there
without
him
or
margaret
children
are
all
little
cains
said
he
in
this
oasis
then
he
spoke
to
margaret
and
said
dear
margaret
i
have
thought
more
than
ever
of
thee
of
late
and
have
asked
myself
why
i
am
content
and
thou
because
thou
art
better
wiser
holier
than
i
that
is
all
said
margaret
promptly
our
lives
tell
another
tale
said
gerard
thoughtfully
i
know
thy
goodness
and
thy
wisdom
too
well
to
reason
thus
perversely
also
i
know
that
i
love
thee
as
dear
as
thou
i
think
lovest
me
yet
am
i
happier
than
thou
why
is
this
so
dear
gerard
i
am
as
happy
as
a
woman
can
hope
to
be
this
side
of
the
not
so
happy
as
i
now
for
the
reason
first
then
i
am
a
priest
and
this
the
one
great
trial
and
disappointment
god
giveth
me
along
with
so
many
joys
why
i
share
it
with
a
multitude
for
alas
i
am
not
the
only
priest
by
thousands
that
must
never
hope
for
entire
earthly
happiness
here
then
thy
lot
is
harder
than
but
gerard
i
have
my
child
to
love
thou
canst
not
fill
thy
heart
with
him
as
his
mother
can
so
you
may
set
this
against
and
i
have
him
from
thee
it
was
cruel
but
he
would
have
broken
thy
heart
one
day
if
i
had
not
well
then
sweet
one
i
come
to
where
the
shoe
pincheth
methinks
i
have
my
parish
and
it
keeps
my
heart
in
a
glow
from
morn
till
night
there
is
scarce
an
emotion
that
my
folk
stir
not
up
in
me
many
times
a
day
often
their
sorrows
make
me
weep
sometimes
their
perversity
kindles
a
little
wrath
and
their
absurdity
makes
me
laugh
and
sometimes
their
flashes
of
unexpected
goodness
do
set
me
all
of
a
glow
and
i
could
hug
meantime
thou
poor
soul
sittest
with
heart
of
lead
gerard
of
very
see
now
how
unkind
thy
lot
compared
with
mine
now
how
if
thou
couldst
be
persuaded
to
warm
thyself
at
the
fire
that
warmeth
ah
if
i
could
hast
but
to
will
it
come
among
my
folk
take
in
thine
hand
the
alms
i
set
aside
and
give
it
with
kind
words
hear
their
sorrows
they
shall
show
you
life
is
full
of
troubles
and
as
thou
sayest
truly
no
man
or
woman
without
their
thorn
this
side
the
grave
indoors
i
have
a
map
of
gouda
parish
not
to
thee
at
first
i
will
put
twenty
housen
under
thee
with
their
folk
what
sayest
thou
but
for
thy
wisdom
i
had
died
a
dirty
maniac
and
seen
gouda
manse
nor
pious
peace
wilt
profit
in
turn
by
what
little
wisdom
i
have
to
soften
her
lot
to
whom
i
do
owe
all
margaret
assented
warmly
and
a
happy
thing
it
was
for
the
little
district
assigned
to
her
it
was
as
if
an
angel
had
descended
on
them
her
fingers
were
never
tired
of
knitting
or
cutting
for
them
her
heart
of
sympathizing
with
them
and
that
heart
expanded
and
waved
its
drooping
wings
and
the
glow
of
good
and
gentle
deed
began
to
spread
over
it
and
she
was
rewarded
in
another
way
by
being
brought
into
more
contact
with
gerard
and
also
with
his
spirit
all
this
time
malicious
tongues
had
not
been
idle
if
there
is
nought
between
them
more
than
meets
the
eye
why
doth
she
not
marry
etc
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
our
old
friend
joan
ketel
was
one
of
these
coarse
sceptics
and
now
one
winter
evening
she
got
on
a
hot
scent
she
saw
margaret
and
gerard
talking
earnestly
together
on
the
boulevard
she
whipped
behind
a
tree
now
i
hear
something
said
she
and
so
she
did
it
was
winter
there
had
been
one
of
those
tremendous
floods
followed
by
a
sharp
frost
and
gerard
in
despair
as
to
where
he
should
lodge
forty
or
fifty
houseless
folk
out
of
the
piercing
cold
and
now
it
was
oh
dear
dear
margaret
what
shall
i
do
the
manse
is
full
of
them
and
a
sharp
frost
coming
on
this
margaret
reflected
and
joan
listened
you
must
lodge
them
in
the
church
said
margaret
quietly
in
the
church
no
charity
profanes
nothing
not
even
a
church
soils
nought
not
even
a
church
is
but
tuesday
go
save
their
lives
for
a
bitter
night
is
coming
take
thy
stove
into
the
church
and
there
house
them
we
will
dispose
of
them
here
and
there
ere
the
lord
and
i
could
not
think
of
that
bless
thee
sweet
margaret
thy
mind
is
stronger
than
mine
and
nay
nay
a
woman
looks
but
a
little
way
therefore
she
sees
clear
i
come
over
myself
and
on
this
they
parted
with
mutual
blessings
joan
glided
home
remorseful
and
after
that
she
used
to
check
all
surmises
to
their
discredit
beware
she
would
say
lest
some
angel
should
blister
thy
tongue
gerard
and
margaret
paramours
i
tell
ye
they
are
two
saints
which
meet
in
secret
to
plot
charity
to
the
in
the
summer
of
gerard
determined
to
provide
against
similar
disasters
recurring
to
his
poor
accordingly
he
made
a
great
hole
in
his
income
and
bled
his
friends
zealous
parsons
always
do
that
to
build
a
large
xenodochium
to
receive
the
victims
of
flood
or
fire
giles
and
all
his
friends
were
kind
but
all
was
not
enough
when
lo
the
dominican
monks
of
gouda
to
whom
his
parlour
and
heart
had
been
open
for
years
came
out
nobly
and
put
down
a
handsome
sum
to
aid
the
charitable
vicar
the
dear
good
souls
said
margaret
who
would
have
thought
it
any
one
who
knows
them
said
gerard
who
more
charitable
than
monks
go
to
they
do
but
give
the
laity
back
a
pig
of
their
own
and
what
more
do
i
what
more
doth
the
duke
then
the
ambitious
vicar
must
build
almshouses
for
decayed
true
men
in
their
old
age
close
to
the
manse
that
he
might
keep
and
feed
them
as
well
as
lodge
them
and
his
money
being
gone
he
asked
margaret
for
a
few
thousand
bricks
and
just
took
off
his
coat
and
turned
builder
and
as
he
had
a
good
head
and
the
strength
of
a
hercules
with
the
zeal
of
an
artist
up
rose
a
couple
of
almshouses
parson
built
and
at
this
work
margaret
would
sometimes
bring
him
his
dinner
and
add
a
good
bottle
of
rhenish
and
once
seeing
him
run
up
a
plank
with
a
wheelbarrow
full
of
bricks
which
really
most
bricklayers
would
have
gone
staggering
under
she
said
times
are
changed
since
i
had
to
carry
little
gerard
for
ay
dear
one
thanks
to
when
the
first
home
was
finished
the
question
was
who
they
should
put
into
it
and
being
fastidious
over
it
like
a
new
toy
there
was
much
hesitation
but
an
old
friend
arrived
in
time
to
settle
this
question
as
gerard
was
passing
a
in
rotterdam
one
day
he
heard
a
voice
he
looked
up
and
there
was
denys
of
burgundy
but
sadly
changed
his
beard
stained
with
grey
and
his
clothes
worn
and
ragged
he
had
a
cuirass
still
and
gauntlets
but
a
staff
instead
of
an
arbalest
to
the
company
he
appeared
to
be
bragging
and
boasting
but
in
reality
he
was
giving
a
true
relation
of
edward
the
fourth
invasion
of
an
armed
kingdom
with
men
and
his
march
through
the
country
with
armies
capable
of
swallowing
him
looking
on
his
battles
at
tewkesbury
and
barnet
and
reoccupation
of
his
capital
and
kingdom
in
three
months
after
landing
at
the
humber
with
a
mixed
handful
of
dutch
english
and
burgundians
in
this
the
greatest
feat
of
arms
the
century
had
seen
denys
had
shone
and
whilst
sneering
at
the
warlike
pretensions
of
charles
the
bold
a
duke
with
an
itch
but
no
talent
for
fighting
and
proclaiming
the
english
king
the
first
captain
of
the
age
did
not
forget
to
exalt
himself
gerard
listened
with
eyes
glittering
affection
and
fun
and
now
said
denys
after
all
these
feats
patted
on
the
back
by
the
gallant
young
prince
of
gloucester
and
smiled
on
by
the
great
captain
himself
here
i
am
lamed
for
life
by
what
by
the
kick
of
a
horse
and
this
night
i
know
not
where
i
shall
lay
my
tired
bones
i
had
a
comrade
once
in
these
parts
that
would
not
have
let
me
lie
far
from
him
but
he
turned
priest
and
deserted
his
sweetheart
so
is
not
likely
he
would
remember
his
comrade
and
ten
years
play
sad
havoc
with
our
hearts
and
limbs
and
poor
denys
sighed
and
gerard
bowels
yearned
over
him
what
words
are
these
he
said
with
a
great
gulp
in
his
throat
who
grudges
a
brave
soldier
supper
and
bed
come
home
with
me
much
obliged
but
i
am
no
lover
of
nor
i
of
soldiers
but
what
is
supper
and
bed
between
two
true
men
not
much
to
you
but
something
to
me
i
will
in
one
hour
said
gerard
and
went
in
high
spirits
to
margaret
and
told
her
the
treat
in
store
and
she
must
come
and
share
it
she
must
drive
his
mother
in
his
little
carriage
up
to
the
manse
with
all
speed
and
make
ready
an
excellent
supper
then
he
himself
borrowed
a
cart
and
drove
denys
up
rather
slowly
to
give
the
women
time
on
the
road
denys
found
out
this
priest
was
a
kind
soul
so
told
him
his
trouble
and
confessed
his
heart
was
pretty
near
broken
the
great
use
our
stout
hearts
and
arms
and
lives
till
we
are
worn
out
and
then
fling
us
away
like
broken
he
sighed
deeply
and
it
cost
gerard
a
great
struggle
not
to
hug
him
then
and
there
and
tell
him
but
he
wanted
to
do
it
all
like
a
story
book
who
has
not
had
this
fancy
once
in
his
life
why
joseph
had
it
all
the
better
for
us
they
landed
at
the
little
house
it
was
as
clean
as
a
penny
the
hearth
blazing
and
supper
set
denys
brightened
up
is
this
your
house
reverend
sir
well
is
my
work
and
with
these
hands
but
is
your
ah
no
such
luck
said
denys
with
a
sigh
but
i
say
ay
shouted
gerard
and
what
is
more
i
gulp
say
gulp
courage
camarade
le
diable
est
mort
denys
started
and
almost
staggered
why
what
he
stammered
art
thou
that
bringest
me
back
the
merry
words
and
merry
days
of
my
youth
and
he
was
greatly
agitated
my
poor
denys
i
am
one
whose
face
is
changed
but
nought
else
to
my
heart
dear
trusty
comrade
to
my
heart
and
he
opened
his
arms
with
the
tears
in
his
eyes
but
denys
came
close
to
him
and
peered
in
his
face
and
devoured
every
feature
and
when
he
was
sure
it
was
really
gerard
he
uttered
a
cry
so
vehement
it
brought
the
women
running
from
the
house
and
fell
upon
gerard
neck
and
kissed
him
again
and
again
and
sank
on
his
knees
and
laughed
and
sobbed
with
joy
so
terribly
that
gerard
mourned
his
folly
in
doing
dramas
but
the
women
with
their
gentle
soothing
ways
soon
composed
the
brave
fellow
and
he
sat
smiling
and
holding
margaret
hand
and
gerard
and
they
all
supped
together
and
went
to
their
beds
with
hearts
warm
as
a
toast
and
the
broken
soldier
was
at
peace
and
in
his
own
house
and
under
his
wing
his
natural
gaiety
returned
and
he
resumed
his
consigne
after
eight
years
disuse
and
hobbled
about
the
place
enlivening
it
but
offended
the
parish
mortally
by
calling
the
adored
vicar
comrade
and
nothing
but
comrade
when
they
made
a
fuss
about
this
to
gerard
he
just
looked
in
their
faces
and
said
what
does
it
matter
break
him
of
swearing
and
you
shall
have
my
this
year
margaret
went
to
a
lawyer
to
make
her
will
for
without
this
she
was
told
her
boy
might
have
trouble
some
day
to
get
his
own
not
being
born
in
lawful
wedlock
the
lawyer
however
in
conversation
expressed
a
different
opinion
this
is
the
babble
of
churchmen
said
he
yours
is
a
perfect
marriage
though
an
irregular
he
then
informed
her
that
throughout
europe
excepting
only
the
southern
part
of
britain
there
were
three
irregular
marriages
the
highest
of
which
was
hers
a
betrothal
before
witnesses
this
said
he
if
not
followed
by
matrimonial
intercourse
is
a
marriage
complete
in
form
but
incomplete
in
substance
a
person
so
betrothed
can
forbid
any
other
banns
to
all
eternity
it
has
however
been
set
aside
where
a
party
so
betrothed
contrived
to
get
married
regularly
and
children
were
born
thereafter
but
such
a
decision
was
for
the
sake
of
the
offspring
and
of
doubtful
justice
however
in
your
case
the
birth
of
your
child
closes
that
door
and
your
marriage
is
complete
both
in
form
and
substance
your
course
therefore
is
to
sue
for
your
conjugal
rights
it
will
be
the
prettiest
case
of
the
century
the
law
is
all
on
our
side
the
church
all
on
theirs
if
you
come
to
that
the
old
batavian
law
which
compelled
the
clergy
to
marry
hath
fallen
into
disuse
but
was
never
formally
margaret
was
quite
puzzled
what
are
you
driving
at
sir
who
am
i
to
go
to
law
with
who
is
the
defendant
why
the
vicar
of
alas
poor
soul
and
for
what
shall
i
law
him
why
to
make
him
take
you
into
his
house
and
share
bed
and
board
with
you
to
be
margaret
turned
red
as
fire
gramercy
for
your
rede
said
she
what
is
yon
a
woman
part
constrain
a
man
to
be
hers
by
force
that
is
men
way
of
wooing
not
ours
say
i
were
so
ill
a
woman
as
ye
think
me
i
should
set
myself
to
beguile
him
not
to
law
him
and
she
departed
crimson
with
shame
and
indignation
there
is
an
impracticable
fool
for
you
said
the
man
of
art
margaret
had
her
will
drawn
elsewhere
and
made
her
boy
safe
from
poverty
marriage
or
no
marriage
these
are
the
principal
incidents
that
in
ten
whole
years
befell
two
peaceful
lives
which
in
a
much
shorter
period
had
been
so
thronged
with
adventures
and
emotions
their
general
tenor
was
now
peace
piety
the
mild
content
that
lasts
not
the
fierce
bliss
ever
on
tiptoe
to
depart
and
above
all
christian
charity
on
this
sacred
ground
these
two
true
lovers
met
with
an
uniformity
and
a
kindness
of
sentiment
which
went
far
to
soothe
the
wound
in
their
own
hearts
to
pity
the
same
bereaved
to
hunt
in
couples
all
the
ills
in
gouda
and
contrive
and
scheme
together
to
remedy
all
that
were
remediable
to
use
the
rare
insight
into
troubled
hearts
which
their
own
troubles
had
given
them
and
use
it
to
make
others
happier
than
themselves
this
was
their
daily
practice
and
in
this
blessed
cause
their
passions
for
one
another
cooled
a
little
but
their
affection
increased
from
this
time
margaret
entered
heart
and
soul
into
gerard
pious
charities
that
affection
purged
itself
of
all
mortal
dross
and
as
it
had
now
long
scandal
and
misapprehension
one
would
have
thought
that
so
bright
an
example
of
pure
affection
was
to
remain
long
before
the
world
to
show
men
how
nearly
religious
faith
even
when
not
quite
reasonable
and
religious
charity
which
is
always
reasonable
could
raise
two
true
lovers
hearts
to
the
loving
hearts
of
the
angels
of
heaven
but
the
great
disposer
of
events
ordered
otherwise
little
gerard
rejoiced
both
his
parents
hearts
by
the
extraordinary
progress
he
made
at
alexander
haaghe
famous
school
at
deventer
the
last
time
margaret
returned
from
visiting
him
she
came
to
gerard
flushed
with
pride
oh
gerard
he
will
be
a
great
man
one
day
thanks
to
thy
wisdom
in
taking
him
from
us
silly
women
a
great
scholar
one
zinthius
came
to
see
the
school
and
judge
the
scholars
and
did
our
gerard
stand
up
and
not
a
line
in
horace
or
terence
could
zinthius
cite
but
the
boy
would
follow
him
with
the
rest
is
a
prodigy
says
that
great
scholar
and
there
was
his
poor
mother
stood
by
and
heard
it
and
he
took
our
gerard
in
his
arms
and
kissed
him
and
what
think
you
he
said
nay
i
know
will
hear
of
thee
one
day
and
not
holland
only
but
all
the
world
why
what
a
sad
brow
sweet
one
i
am
as
glad
as
thou
yet
am
i
uneasy
to
hear
the
child
is
wise
before
his
time
i
love
him
dear
but
he
is
thine
idol
and
heaven
doth
often
break
our
make
thy
mind
easy
said
margaret
heaven
will
never
rob
me
of
my
child
what
i
was
to
suffer
in
this
world
i
have
suffered
for
if
any
ill
happened
my
child
or
thee
i
should
not
live
a
week
the
lord
he
knows
this
and
he
will
leave
me
my
a
month
had
elapsed
after
this
but
margaret
words
were
yet
ringing
in
his
ears
when
going
on
his
daily
round
of
visits
to
his
poor
he
was
told
quite
incidentally
and
as
mere
gossip
that
the
plague
was
at
deventer
carried
thither
by
two
sailors
from
hamburgh
his
heart
turned
cold
within
him
news
did
not
gallop
in
those
days
the
fatal
disease
must
have
been
there
a
long
time
before
the
tidings
would
reach
gouda
he
sent
a
line
by
a
messenger
to
margaret
telling
her
that
he
was
gone
to
fetch
little
gerard
to
stay
at
the
manse
a
little
while
and
would
she
see
a
bed
prepared
for
he
should
be
back
next
day
and
so
he
hoped
she
would
not
hear
a
word
of
the
danger
till
it
was
all
happily
over
he
borrowed
a
good
horse
and
scarce
drew
rein
till
he
reached
deventer
quite
late
in
the
afternoon
he
went
at
once
to
the
school
the
boy
had
been
taken
away
as
he
left
the
school
he
caught
sight
of
margaret
face
at
the
window
of
a
neighbouring
house
she
always
lodged
at
when
she
came
to
deventer
he
ran
hastily
to
scold
her
and
pack
both
her
and
the
boy
out
of
the
place
to
his
surprise
the
servant
told
him
with
some
hesitation
that
margaret
had
been
there
but
was
gone
gone
woman
said
gerard
indignantly
art
not
ashamed
to
say
so
why
i
saw
her
but
now
at
the
oh
if
you
saw
her
a
sweet
voice
above
said
stay
him
not
let
him
it
was
margaret
gerard
ran
up
the
stairs
to
her
and
went
to
take
her
hand
she
drew
back
hastily
he
looked
astounded
i
am
displeased
she
said
coldly
what
makes
you
here
know
you
not
the
plague
is
in
the
town
ay
dear
margaret
and
came
straightway
to
take
our
boy
what
had
he
no
mother
how
you
speak
to
me
i
hoped
you
knew
what
think
you
i
leave
my
boy
unwatched
i
pay
a
trusty
woman
that
notes
every
change
in
his
cheek
when
i
am
not
here
and
lets
me
know
i
am
his
where
is
he
in
rotterdam
i
hope
ere
thank
heaven
and
why
are
you
not
there
i
am
not
fit
for
the
journey
never
heed
me
go
you
home
on
the
instant
i
follow
for
shame
of
you
to
come
here
risking
your
precious
it
is
not
so
precious
as
thine
said
gerard
but
let
that
pass
we
will
go
home
together
and
on
the
nay
i
have
some
matters
to
do
in
the
town
go
thou
at
once
and
i
will
follow
leave
thee
alone
in
a
town
to
whom
speak
you
dear
margaret
nay
then
we
shall
quarrel
methinks
i
see
margaret
and
gerard
quarrelling
why
it
takes
two
to
quarrel
and
we
are
but
with
this
gerard
smiled
on
her
sweetly
but
there
was
no
kind
responsive
glance
she
looked
cold
gloomy
and
troubled
he
sighed
and
sat
patiently
down
opposite
her
with
his
face
all
puzzled
and
saddened
he
said
nothing
for
he
felt
sure
she
would
explain
her
capricious
conduct
or
it
would
explain
itself
presently
she
rose
hastily
and
tried
to
reach
her
bedroom
but
on
the
way
she
staggered
and
put
out
her
hand
he
ran
to
her
with
a
cry
of
alarm
she
swooned
in
his
arms
he
laid
her
gently
on
the
ground
and
beat
her
cold
hands
and
ran
to
her
bedroom
and
fetched
water
and
sprinkled
her
pale
face
his
own
was
scarce
less
pale
for
in
a
basin
he
had
seen
water
stained
with
blood
it
alarmed
him
he
knew
not
why
she
was
a
long
time
ere
she
revived
and
when
she
did
she
found
gerard
holding
her
hand
and
bending
over
her
with
a
look
of
infinite
concern
and
tenderness
she
seemed
at
first
as
if
she
responded
to
it
but
the
next
moment
her
eyes
dilated
and
she
cried
ah
wretch
leave
my
hand
how
dare
you
touch
me
heaven
help
her
said
gerard
she
is
not
you
will
not
leave
me
then
gerard
said
she
faintly
alas
why
do
i
ask
would
i
leave
thee
if
thou
wert
at
least
touch
me
not
and
then
i
will
let
thee
bide
and
see
the
last
of
poor
margaret
she
spoke
harsh
to
thee
before
sweetheart
and
she
never
will
alas
what
mean
these
dark
words
these
wild
and
troubled
looks
said
gerard
clasping
his
hands
my
poor
gerard
said
margaret
forgive
me
that
i
spoke
so
to
thee
i
am
but
a
woman
and
would
have
spared
thee
a
sight
will
make
thee
she
burst
into
tears
ah
me
she
cried
weeping
that
i
can
not
keep
grief
from
thee
there
is
a
great
sorrow
before
my
darling
and
this
time
i
shall
not
be
able
to
come
and
dry
his
let
it
come
margaret
so
it
touch
not
thee
said
gerard
trembling
dearest
said
margaret
solemnly
call
now
religion
to
thine
aid
and
mine
i
must
have
died
before
thee
one
day
or
else
outlived
thee
and
so
died
of
died
thou
die
i
will
never
let
thee
die
where
is
thy
pain
what
is
thy
trouble
the
plague
she
said
calmly
gerard
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
and
started
to
his
feet
she
read
his
thought
useless
said
she
quietly
my
nose
hath
bled
none
ever
yet
survived
to
whom
that
came
along
with
the
plague
bring
no
fools
hither
to
babble
over
the
body
they
can
not
save
i
am
but
a
woman
i
love
not
to
be
stared
at
let
none
see
me
die
but
and
even
with
this
a
convulsion
seized
her
and
she
remained
sensible
but
speechless
a
long
time
and
now
for
the
first
time
gerard
began
to
realize
the
frightful
truth
and
he
ran
wildly
to
and
fro
and
cried
to
heaven
for
help
as
drowning
men
cry
to
their
she
raised
herself
on
her
arm
and
set
herself
to
quiet
him
she
told
him
she
had
known
the
torture
of
hopes
and
fears
and
was
resolved
to
spare
him
that
agony
i
let
my
mind
dwell
too
much
on
the
danger
said
she
and
so
opened
my
brain
to
it
through
which
door
when
this
subtle
venom
enters
it
makes
short
work
i
shall
not
be
spotted
or
loathsome
my
poor
darling
god
is
good
and
spares
thee
that
but
in
twelve
hours
i
shall
be
a
dead
woman
ah
look
not
so
but
be
a
man
be
a
priest
waste
not
one
precious
minute
over
my
body
it
is
doomed
but
comfort
my
parting
gerard
sick
and
cold
at
heart
kneeled
down
and
prayed
for
help
from
heaven
to
do
his
duty
when
he
rose
from
his
knees
his
face
was
pale
and
old
but
deadly
calm
and
patient
he
went
softly
and
brought
her
bed
into
the
room
and
laid
her
gently
down
and
supported
her
head
with
pillows
then
he
prayed
by
her
side
the
prayers
for
the
dying
and
she
said
amen
to
each
prayer
then
for
some
hours
she
wandered
but
when
the
fell
disease
had
quite
made
sure
of
its
prey
her
mind
cleared
and
she
begged
gerard
to
shrive
her
for
oh
my
conscience
it
is
laden
she
said
sadly
confess
thy
sins
to
me
my
daughter
let
there
be
no
my
father
said
she
sadly
i
have
one
great
sin
on
my
breast
this
many
years
now
that
death
is
at
my
heart
i
can
scarce
own
it
but
the
lord
is
debonair
if
thou
wilt
pray
to
him
perchance
he
may
forgive
confess
it
first
my
i
alas
confess
it
i
deceived
thee
this
many
years
i
have
deceived
here
tears
interrupted
her
speech
courage
my
daughter
courage
said
gerard
kindly
overpowering
the
lover
in
the
priest
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
with
many
sighs
told
him
it
was
she
who
had
broken
down
the
hermit
cave
with
the
help
of
jorian
ketel
i
shallow
did
it
but
to
hinder
thy
return
thither
but
when
thou
sawest
therein
the
finger
of
god
i
played
the
traitress
and
said
he
thinks
so
he
will
leave
gouda
manse
and
i
held
my
tongue
oh
false
courage
my
daughter
thou
dost
exaggerate
a
trivial
ah
but
is
not
all
the
well
they
followed
thee
not
to
gouda
by
miracle
but
by
my
treason
i
said
he
will
be
quite
happy
without
his
birds
that
visited
him
in
his
cell
and
i
was
jealous
of
them
and
cried
and
said
these
foul
little
things
they
are
my
child
rivals
and
i
bought
loaves
of
bread
and
jorian
and
me
we
put
crumbs
at
the
cave
door
and
thence
went
sprinkling
them
all
the
way
to
the
manse
and
there
a
heap
and
my
wiles
succeeded
and
they
came
and
thou
wast
glad
and
i
was
pleased
to
see
thee
glad
and
when
thou
sawest
in
my
guile
the
finger
of
heaven
wicked
deceitful
i
did
hold
my
tongue
but
die
deceiving
thee
ah
no
i
could
not
forgive
me
if
thou
canst
i
was
but
a
woman
i
knew
no
better
at
the
time
was
writ
in
my
bosom
with
a
very
sunbeam
good
for
him
to
bide
at
gouda
manse
forgive
thee
sweet
innocent
sobbed
gerard
what
have
i
to
forgive
thou
hadst
a
foolish
froward
child
to
guide
to
his
own
weal
and
didst
all
this
for
the
best
i
thank
thee
and
bless
thee
but
as
thy
confessor
all
deceit
is
ill
in
heaven
pure
eyes
therefore
thou
hast
done
well
to
confess
and
report
it
and
even
on
thy
confession
and
penitence
the
church
through
me
absolves
thee
pass
to
thy
graver
my
graver
faults
alas
alas
why
what
have
i
done
to
compare
i
am
not
an
ill
woman
not
a
very
ill
one
if
he
can
forgive
me
deceiving
thee
he
can
well
forgive
me
all
the
rest
ever
i
being
gently
pressed
she
said
she
was
to
blame
not
to
have
done
more
good
in
the
world
i
have
just
begun
to
do
a
little
she
said
and
now
i
must
go
but
i
repine
not
since
is
heaven
will
only
i
am
so
afeard
thou
wilt
miss
and
at
this
she
could
not
restrain
her
tears
though
she
tried
hard
gerard
struggled
with
his
as
well
as
he
could
and
knowing
her
life
of
piety
purity
and
charity
and
seeing
that
she
could
not
in
her
present
state
realise
any
sin
but
her
having
deceived
him
gave
her
full
absolution
then
he
put
the
crucifix
in
her
hand
and
while
he
consecrated
the
oil
bade
her
fix
her
mind
neither
on
her
merits
nor
her
demerits
but
on
him
who
died
for
her
on
the
tree
she
obeyed
him
with
a
look
of
confiding
love
and
submission
and
he
touched
her
eyes
with
the
consecrated
oil
and
prayed
aloud
beside
her
soon
after
she
dosed
he
watched
beside
her
more
dead
than
alive
himself
when
the
day
broke
she
awoke
and
seemed
to
acquire
some
energy
she
begged
him
to
look
in
her
box
for
her
marriage
lines
and
for
a
picture
and
bring
them
both
to
her
he
did
so
she
then
entreated
him
by
all
they
had
suffered
for
each
other
to
ease
her
mind
by
making
a
solemn
vow
to
execute
her
dying
requests
he
vowed
to
obey
them
to
the
letter
then
gerard
let
no
creature
come
here
to
lay
me
out
i
could
not
bear
to
be
stared
at
my
very
corpse
would
blush
also
i
would
not
be
made
a
monster
of
for
the
worms
to
sneer
at
as
well
as
feed
on
also
my
very
clothes
are
tainted
and
shall
to
earth
with
me
i
am
a
daughter
and
ill
becomes
me
kill
folk
being
dead
which
did
so
little
good
to
men
in
the
days
of
health
wherefore
lap
me
in
lead
the
way
i
am
and
bury
me
deep
yet
not
so
deep
but
what
one
day
thou
mayst
find
the
way
and
lay
thy
bones
by
mine
whiles
i
lived
i
went
to
gouda
but
once
or
twice
a
week
it
cost
me
not
to
go
each
day
let
me
gain
this
by
dying
to
be
always
at
dear
gouda
in
the
green
kirkyard
also
they
do
say
the
spirit
hovers
where
the
body
lies
i
would
have
my
spirit
hover
near
thee
and
the
kirkyard
is
not
far
from
the
manse
i
am
so
afeard
some
ill
will
happen
thee
margaret
being
gone
and
see
with
mine
own
hands
i
place
my
marriage
lines
in
my
bosom
let
no
living
hand
move
them
on
pain
of
thy
curse
and
mine
then
when
the
angel
comes
for
me
at
the
last
day
he
shall
say
this
is
an
honest
woman
she
hath
her
marriage
lines
for
you
know
i
am
your
lawful
wife
though
holy
church
hath
come
between
us
and
he
will
set
me
where
the
honest
women
be
i
will
not
sit
among
ill
women
no
not
in
heaven
for
their
mind
is
not
my
mind
nor
their
soul
my
soul
i
have
stood
unbeknown
at
my
window
and
heard
their
for
some
time
she
was
unable
to
say
any
more
but
made
signs
to
him
that
she
had
not
done
at
last
she
recovered
her
breath
and
bade
him
look
at
the
picture
it
was
the
portrait
he
had
made
of
her
when
they
were
young
together
and
little
thought
to
part
so
soon
he
held
it
in
his
hands
and
looked
at
it
but
could
scarce
see
it
he
had
left
it
in
fragments
but
now
it
was
whole
they
cut
it
to
pieces
gerard
but
see
love
mocked
at
their
knives
i
implore
thee
with
my
dying
breath
let
this
picture
hang
ever
in
thine
eye
i
have
heard
that
such
as
die
of
the
plague
unspotted
yet
after
death
spots
have
been
known
to
come
out
and
oh
i
could
not
bear
thy
last
memory
of
me
to
be
so
therefore
as
soon
as
the
breath
is
out
of
my
body
cover
my
face
with
this
handkerchief
and
look
at
me
no
more
till
we
meet
again
not
be
so
very
long
o
i
promise
said
gerard
sobbing
but
look
on
this
picture
instead
forgive
me
i
am
but
a
woman
i
could
not
bear
my
face
to
lie
a
foul
thing
in
thy
memory
nay
i
must
have
thee
still
think
me
as
fair
as
i
was
true
hast
called
me
an
angel
once
or
twice
but
be
just
did
i
not
still
tell
thee
i
was
no
angel
but
only
a
poor
simple
woman
that
whiles
saw
clearer
than
thou
because
she
looked
but
a
little
way
and
that
loves
thee
dearly
and
never
loved
but
thee
and
now
with
her
dying
breath
prays
thee
indulge
her
in
this
thou
that
art
a
i
will
i
will
each
word
each
wish
is
bless
thee
bless
thee
so
then
the
eyes
that
now
can
scarce
see
thee
they
are
so
troubled
by
the
pest
and
the
lips
that
shall
not
touch
thee
to
taint
thee
will
still
be
before
thee
as
they
were
when
we
were
young
and
thou
didst
love
when
i
did
love
thee
margaret
oh
never
loved
i
thee
as
hast
not
told
me
so
of
alas
hath
love
no
voice
but
words
i
was
a
priest
i
had
charge
of
thy
soul
the
sweet
offices
of
a
pure
love
were
lawful
words
of
love
imprudent
at
the
least
but
now
the
good
fight
is
won
ah
me
oh
my
love
if
thou
hast
lived
doubting
of
thy
gerard
heart
die
not
so
for
never
was
woman
loved
so
tenderly
as
thou
this
ten
years
calm
thyself
dear
one
said
the
dying
woman
with
a
heavenly
smile
i
know
it
only
being
but
a
woman
i
could
not
die
happy
till
i
had
heard
thee
say
so
ah
i
have
pined
ten
years
for
those
sweet
words
hast
said
them
and
this
is
the
happiest
hour
of
my
life
i
had
to
die
to
get
them
well
i
grudge
not
the
from
this
moment
a
gentle
complacency
rested
on
her
fading
features
but
she
did
not
speak
then
gerard
who
had
loved
her
soul
so
many
years
feared
lest
she
should
expire
with
a
mind
too
fixed
on
earthly
affection
oh
my
daughter
he
cried
my
dear
daughter
if
indeed
thou
lovest
me
as
i
love
thee
give
me
not
the
pain
of
seeing
thee
die
with
thy
pious
soul
fixed
on
mortal
things
dearest
lamb
of
all
my
fold
for
whose
soul
i
must
answer
oh
think
not
now
of
mortal
love
but
of
his
who
died
for
thee
on
the
tree
oh
let
thy
last
look
be
heavenwards
thy
last
word
a
word
of
she
turned
a
look
of
gratitude
and
obedience
on
him
what
saint
she
murmured
meaning
doubtless
what
saint
should
she
invoke
as
an
he
to
whom
the
saints
themselves
do
she
turned
on
him
one
more
sweet
look
of
love
and
submission
and
put
her
pretty
hands
together
in
a
prayer
like
a
child
jesu
this
blessed
word
was
her
last
she
lay
with
her
eyes
heavenwards
and
her
hands
put
together
gerard
prayed
fervently
for
her
passing
spirit
and
when
he
had
prayed
a
long
time
with
his
head
averted
not
to
see
her
last
breath
all
seemed
unnaturally
still
he
turned
his
head
fearfully
it
was
so
she
was
gone
nothing
left
him
now
but
the
earthly
shell
of
as
constant
pure
and
loving
a
spirit
as
eve
adorned
the
earth
let
me
not
be
understood
to
apply
this
to
the
bare
outline
of
the
relation
many
bishops
and
priests
and
not
a
few
popes
had
wives
and
children
as
laymen
and
entering
orders
were
parted
from
the
wives
and
not
from
the
children
but
in
the
case
before
the
reader
are
the
additional
features
of
a
strong
surviving
attachment
on
both
sides
and
of
neighbourhood
besides
that
here
the
man
had
been
led
into
holy
orders
by
a
false
statement
of
the
woman
death
on
a
summary
of
all
the
essential
features
the
situation
was
to
the
best
of
my
belief
unique
chapter
xcvii
a
priest
is
never
more
thoroughly
a
priest
than
in
the
chamber
of
death
gerard
did
the
last
offices
of
the
church
for
the
departed
just
as
he
should
have
done
them
for
his
smallest
parishioner
he
did
this
mechanically
then
sat
down
stupefied
by
the
sudden
and
tremendous
blow
and
not
yet
realizing
the
pangs
of
bereavement
then
in
a
transport
of
religious
enthusiasm
he
kneeled
and
thanked
heaven
for
her
christian
end
and
then
all
his
thought
was
to
take
her
away
from
strangers
and
lay
her
in
his
own
churchyard
that
very
evening
a
covered
cart
with
one
horse
started
for
gouda
and
in
it
was
a
coffin
and
a
man
lying
with
his
arms
and
chin
resting
on
it
the
mourner
energy
had
exhausted
itself
in
the
necessary
preparations
and
now
he
lay
crushed
clinging
to
the
cold
lead
that
held
her
the
man
of
whom
the
cart
was
hired
walked
by
the
horse
head
and
did
not
speak
to
him
and
when
he
baited
the
horse
spoke
but
in
a
whisper
respecting
that
mute
agony
but
when
he
stopped
for
the
night
he
and
the
landlord
made
a
attempt
to
get
the
mourner
away
to
take
some
rest
and
food
but
gerard
repulsed
them
and
when
they
persisted
almost
snarled
at
them
like
a
faithful
dog
and
clung
to
the
cold
lead
all
night
so
then
they
drew
a
cloak
over
him
and
left
him
in
peace
and
at
noon
the
sorrowful
cart
came
up
to
the
manse
and
there
were
full
a
score
of
parishioners
collected
with
one
little
paltry
trouble
or
another
they
had
missed
the
parson
already
and
when
they
saw
what
it
was
and
saw
their
healer
so
stricken
down
they
raised
a
loud
wail
of
grief
and
it
roused
him
from
his
lethargy
of
woe
and
he
saw
where
he
was
and
their
faces
and
tried
to
speak
to
them
oh
my
children
my
children
he
cried
but
choked
with
anguish
could
say
no
more
yet
the
next
day
spite
of
all
remonstrances
he
buried
her
himself
and
read
the
service
with
a
voice
that
only
trembled
now
and
then
many
tears
fell
upon
her
grave
and
when
the
service
ended
he
stayed
there
standing
like
a
statue
and
the
people
left
the
churchyard
out
of
respect
he
stood
like
one
in
a
dream
till
the
sexton
who
was
as
most
men
are
a
fool
began
to
fill
in
the
grave
without
giving
him
due
warning
but
at
the
sound
of
earth
falling
on
her
gerard
uttered
a
piercing
scream
the
sexton
forbore
gerard
staggered
and
put
his
hand
to
his
breast
the
sexton
supported
him
and
called
for
help
jorian
ketel
who
lingered
near
mourning
his
benefactress
ran
into
the
churchyard
and
the
two
supported
gerard
into
the
manse
ah
jorian
good
jorian
said
he
something
snapped
within
me
i
felt
it
and
i
heard
it
here
jorian
here
and
he
put
his
hand
to
his
breast
chapter
xcviii
a
fortnight
after
this
a
pale
bowed
figure
entered
the
dominican
convent
in
the
suburbs
of
gouda
and
sought
speech
with
brother
ambrose
who
governed
the
convent
as
deputy
the
prior
having
lately
died
and
his
successor
though
appointed
not
having
arrived
the
sick
man
was
gerard
come
to
end
life
as
he
began
it
he
entered
as
a
novice
on
probation
but
the
truth
was
he
was
a
failing
man
and
knew
it
and
came
there
to
die
in
peace
near
kind
and
gentle
ambrose
his
friend
and
the
other
monks
to
whom
his
house
and
heart
had
always
been
open
his
manse
was
more
than
he
could
bear
it
was
too
full
of
reminiscences
of
her
ambrose
who
knew
his
value
and
his
sorrow
was
not
without
a
kindly
hope
of
curing
him
and
restoring
him
to
his
parish
with
this
view
he
put
him
in
a
comfortable
cell
over
the
gateway
and
forbade
him
to
fast
or
practice
any
austerities
but
in
a
few
days
the
new
prior
arrived
and
proved
a
very
tartar
at
first
he
was
absorbed
in
curing
abuses
and
tightening
the
general
discipline
but
one
day
hearing
the
vicar
of
gouda
had
entered
the
convent
as
a
novice
he
said
is
well
let
him
first
give
up
his
vicarage
then
or
go
i
no
fat
parsons
in
my
the
prior
then
sent
for
gerard
and
he
went
to
him
and
the
moment
they
saw
one
another
they
both
started
clement
jerome
chapter
xcix
jerome
was
as
morose
as
ever
in
his
general
character
but
he
had
somewhat
softened
towards
gerard
all
the
time
he
was
in
england
he
had
missed
him
more
then
he
thought
possible
and
since
then
had
often
wondered
what
had
become
of
him
what
he
heard
in
gouda
raised
his
feeble
brother
in
his
good
opinion
above
all
that
he
had
withstood
the
pope
and
the
minorites
on
the
infernal
heresy
of
the
immaculate
conception
as
he
called
it
but
when
one
of
his
young
monks
told
him
with
tears
in
his
eyes
the
cause
of
gerard
illness
all
his
contempt
revived
dying
for
a
woman
he
determined
to
avert
this
scandal
he
visited
clement
twice
a
day
in
his
cell
and
tried
all
his
old
influence
and
all
his
eloquence
to
induce
him
to
shake
off
this
unspiritual
despondency
and
not
rob
the
church
of
his
piety
and
his
eloquence
at
so
critical
a
period
gerard
heard
him
approved
his
reasoning
admired
his
strength
confessed
his
own
weakness
and
continued
visibly
to
wear
away
to
the
land
of
the
leal
one
day
jerome
told
him
he
had
heard
his
story
and
heard
it
with
pride
but
now
said
he
you
spoil
it
all
clement
for
this
is
the
triumph
of
earthly
passion
better
have
yielded
to
it
and
repented
than
resist
it
while
she
lived
and
succumb
under
it
now
body
and
dear
jerome
said
clement
so
sweetly
as
to
rob
his
remonstrance
of
the
tone
of
remonstrance
here
i
think
you
do
me
some
injustice
passion
there
is
none
but
a
deep
affection
for
which
i
will
not
blush
here
since
i
shall
not
blush
for
it
in
heaven
bethink
thee
jerome
the
poor
dog
that
dies
of
grief
on
his
master
grave
is
he
guilty
of
passion
neither
am
i
passion
had
saved
my
life
and
lost
my
soul
she
was
my
good
angel
she
sustained
me
in
my
duty
and
charity
her
face
encouraged
me
in
the
pulpit
her
lips
soothed
me
under
ingratitude
she
intertwined
herself
with
all
that
was
good
in
my
life
and
after
leaning
on
her
so
long
i
could
not
go
on
alone
and
dear
jerome
believe
me
i
am
no
rebel
against
heaven
it
is
god
will
to
release
me
when
they
threw
the
earth
upon
her
poor
coffin
something
snapped
within
my
bosom
here
that
mended
may
not
be
i
heard
it
and
i
felt
it
and
from
that
time
jerome
no
food
that
i
put
in
my
mouth
had
any
savour
with
my
eyes
bandaged
now
i
could
not
tell
thee
which
was
bread
and
which
was
flesh
by
eating
of
holy
saints
and
again
from
that
same
hour
my
deep
dejection
left
me
and
i
smiled
again
i
often
smile
why
i
read
it
thus
he
in
whose
hands
are
the
issues
of
life
and
death
gave
me
that
minute
the
great
summons
was
some
cord
of
life
snapped
in
me
he
is
very
pitiful
i
should
have
lived
unhappy
but
he
said
enough
is
done
enough
is
suffered
poor
feeble
loving
servant
thy
shortcomings
are
forgiven
thy
sorrows
touch
thine
end
come
thou
to
thy
rest
i
come
lord
i
come
jerome
groaned
the
church
had
ever
her
holy
but
feeble
servants
he
said
now
would
i
give
ten
years
of
my
life
to
save
thine
but
i
see
it
may
not
be
die
in
and
so
it
was
that
in
a
few
days
more
gerard
lay
in
a
frame
of
mind
so
holy
and
happy
that
more
than
one
aged
saint
was
there
to
garner
his
dying
words
in
the
evening
he
had
seen
giles
and
begged
him
not
to
let
poor
jack
starve
and
to
see
that
little
gerard
trustees
did
their
duty
and
to
kiss
his
parents
for
him
and
to
send
denys
to
his
friends
in
burgundy
poor
thing
he
will
feel
so
strange
here
without
his
and
after
that
he
had
an
interview
with
jerome
alone
what
passed
between
them
was
never
distinctly
known
but
it
must
have
been
something
remarkable
for
jerome
went
from
the
door
with
his
hands
crossed
on
his
breast
his
high
head
lowered
and
sighing
as
he
went
the
two
monks
that
watched
with
him
till
matins
related
that
all
through
the
night
he
broke
out
from
time
to
time
in
pious
ejaculations
and
praises
and
thanksgivings
only
once
they
said
he
wandered
and
thought
he
saw
her
walking
in
green
meadows
with
other
spirits
clad
in
white
and
beckoning
him
and
they
all
smiled
and
beckoned
him
and
both
these
monks
said
but
it
might
have
been
fancy
that
just
before
dawn
there
came
three
light
taps
against
the
wall
one
after
another
very
slow
and
the
dying
man
heard
them
and
said
i
come
love
i
this
much
is
certain
that
gerard
did
utter
these
words
and
prepare
for
his
departure
having
uttered
them
he
sent
for
all
the
monks
who
at
that
hour
were
keeping
vigil
they
came
and
hovered
like
gentle
spirits
round
him
with
holy
words
some
prayed
in
silence
for
him
with
their
faces
touching
the
ground
others
tenderly
supported
his
head
but
when
one
of
them
said
something
about
his
life
of
and
charity
he
stopped
him
and
addressing
them
all
said
my
dear
brethren
take
note
that
he
who
here
dies
so
happy
holds
not
these
doctrines
of
man
merit
oh
what
a
miserable
hour
were
this
to
me
an
if
i
did
nay
but
i
hold
with
the
apostles
and
their
pupils
in
the
church
the
ancient
fathers
that
we
are
justified
not
by
our
own
wisdom
or
piety
or
the
works
we
have
done
in
holiness
of
heart
but
by
faith
then
there
was
silence
and
the
monks
looked
at
one
another
significantly
please
you
sweep
the
floor
said
the
dying
christian
in
a
voice
to
which
all
its
clearance
and
force
seemed
supernaturally
restored
they
instantly
obeyed
not
without
a
sentiment
of
awe
and
curiosity
make
me
a
great
cross
with
wood
they
strewed
the
ashes
in
form
of
a
great
cross
upon
the
floor
now
lay
me
down
on
it
for
so
will
i
and
they
took
him
gently
from
his
bed
and
laid
him
on
the
cross
of
wood
ashes
shall
we
spread
out
thine
arms
dear
brother
now
god
forbid
am
i
worthy
of
that
he
lay
silent
but
with
his
eyes
raised
in
ecstasy
presently
he
spoke
half
to
them
half
to
himself
oh
he
said
with
a
subdued
but
concentrated
rapture
i
feel
it
buoyant
it
lifts
me
floating
in
the
sky
whence
my
merits
had
sunk
me
like
day
broke
and
displayed
his
face
cast
upward
in
silent
rapture
and
his
hands
together
like
margaret
and
just
about
the
hour
she
died
he
spoke
his
last
word
in
this
world
jesu
and
even
with
that
word
he
fell
asleep
they
laid
him
out
for
his
last
under
his
linen
they
found
a
shirt
ah
cried
the
young
monks
behold
a
saint
under
the
hair
cloth
they
found
a
long
thick
tress
of
auburn
hair
they
started
and
were
horrified
and
a
babel
of
voices
arose
some
condemning
some
excusing
in
the
midst
of
which
jerome
came
in
and
hearing
the
dispute
turned
to
an
ardent
young
monk
called
basil
who
was
crying
scandal
the
loudest
basil
said
he
is
she
alive
or
dead
that
owned
this
hair
how
may
i
know
father
then
for
aught
you
know
it
may
be
the
relic
of
a
saint
certes
it
may
be
said
basil
sceptically
you
have
then
broken
our
rule
which
saith
ill
construction
on
no
act
done
by
a
brother
which
can
be
construed
innocently
who
are
you
to
judge
such
a
man
as
this
was
go
to
your
cell
and
stir
not
out
for
a
week
by
way
of
he
then
carried
off
the
lock
of
hair
and
when
the
coffin
was
to
be
closed
he
cleared
the
cell
and
put
the
tress
upon
the
dead
man
bosom
there
clement
said
he
to
the
dead
face
and
set
himself
a
penance
for
doing
it
and
nailed
the
coffin
up
himself
the
next
day
gerard
was
buried
in
gouda
churchyard
the
monks
followed
him
in
procession
from
the
convent
jerome
who
was
evidently
carrying
out
the
wishes
of
the
deceased
read
the
service
the
grave
was
a
deep
one
and
at
the
bottom
of
it
was
a
lead
coffin
poor
gerard
light
as
a
feather
so
wasted
was
he
was
lowered
and
placed
by
the
side
of
it
after
the
service
jerome
said
a
few
words
to
the
crowd
of
parishioners
that
had
come
to
take
the
last
look
at
their
best
friend
when
he
spoke
of
the
virtues
of
the
departed
loud
wailing
and
weeping
burst
forth
and
tears
fell
upon
the
coffin
like
rain
the
monks
went
home
jerome
collected
them
in
the
refectory
and
spoke
to
them
thus
we
have
this
day
laid
a
saint
in
the
earth
the
convent
will
keep
his
trentals
but
will
feast
not
fast
for
our
good
brother
is
freed
from
the
burden
of
the
flesh
his
labours
are
over
and
he
has
entered
into
his
joyful
rest
i
alone
shall
fast
and
do
penance
for
to
my
shame
i
say
it
i
was
unjust
to
him
and
knew
not
his
worth
till
it
was
too
late
and
you
young
monks
be
not
curious
to
inquire
whether
a
lock
he
bore
on
his
bosom
was
a
token
of
pure
affection
or
the
relic
of
a
saint
but
remember
the
heart
he
wore
beneath
most
of
all
fix
your
eyes
upon
his
life
and
conversation
and
follow
them
an
ye
may
for
he
was
a
holy
thus
after
life
fitful
fever
these
true
lovers
were
at
peace
the
grave
kinder
to
them
than
the
church
united
them
for
ever
and
now
a
man
of
another
age
and
nation
touched
with
their
fate
has
laboured
to
build
their
tombstone
and
rescue
them
from
long
and
unmerited
oblivion
he
asks
for
them
your
sympathy
but
not
your
pity
no
put
this
story
to
a
wholesome
use
fiction
must
often
give
false
views
of
life
and
death
here
as
it
happens
curbed
by
history
she
gives
you
true
ones
let
the
barrier
that
kept
these
true
lovers
apart
prepare
you
for
this
that
here
on
earth
there
will
nearly
always
be
some
obstacle
or
other
to
your
perfect
happiness
to
their
early
death
apply
your
reason
and
your
faith
by
way
of
exercise
and
preparation
for
if
you
can
not
bear
to
be
told
that
these
died
young
who
had
they
lived
a
hundred
years
would
still
be
dead
how
shall
you
bear
to
see
the
gentle
the
loving
and
the
true
glide
from
your
own
bosom
to
the
grave
and
fly
from
your
house
to
heaven
yet
this
is
in
store
for
you
in
every
age
the
master
of
life
and
death
who
is
kinder
as
well
as
wiser
than
we
are
has
transplanted
to
heaven
young
earth
sweetest
flowers
i
ask
your
sympathy
then
for
their
rare
constancy
and
pure
affection
and
their
cruel
separation
by
a
vile
heresy
in
the
bosom
of
the
church
but
not
your
pity
for
their
early
but
happy
end

came
to
himself
in

my

said
the
poor

soothingly
and
in

he
was
clay

that
clay
was
followed
to
the
grave
by

was
glad

there
a
small
pension
the
court
allowed
him

him
until
unexpectedly
he
inherited
a
considerable
sum
from
a
relation
he
was
known
in
his
native
place
for
many
years
as
a
crusty
old
soldier
who
could
tell
good
stories
of
war
when
he
chose
and
a
bitter
railer
against
women
jerome
disgusted
with
northern
laxity
retired
to
italy
and
having
high
connections
became
at
seventy
a
mitred
abbot
he
put
on
the
screw
of
discipline
his
monks
revered
and
hated
him
he
ruled
with
iron
rod
ten
years
and
one
night
he
died
alone
for
he
had
not
found
the
way
to
a
single
heart
the
vulgate
was
on
his
pillow
and
the
crucifix
in
his
hand
and
on
his
lips
something
more
like
a
smile
than
was
ever
seen
there
while
he
lived
so
that
methinks
at
that
awful
hour
he
was
not
quite
alone
