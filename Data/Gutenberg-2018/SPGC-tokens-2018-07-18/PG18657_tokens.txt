the
collected
works
of
henrik
ibsen
volume
i
love
comedy
translation
by
herford
was
published
at
christiania
in
the
polite
world
so
far
as
such
a
thing
existed
at
the
time
in
the
northern
capital
received
it
with
an
outburst
of
indignation
now
entirely
easy
to
understand
it
has
indeed
faults
enough
the
is
often
crude
the
action
though
full
of
effective
extremely
slight
and
the
sensational
climax
has
little
relation
to
human
nature
as
exhibited
in
norway
or
out
of
it
at
that
or
any
other
time
but
the
sting
lay
in
the
unflattering
veracity
of
the
piece
as
a
whole
in
the
merciless
portrayal
of
the
trivialities
of
persons
or
classes
high
in
their
own
esteem
in
the
unexampled
effrontery
of
bringing
a
clergyman
upon
the
stage
all
these
have
long
since
passed
in
scandinavia
into
the
category
of
the
things
which
people
take
with
their
ibsen
as
a
matter
of
course
and
the
play
is
welcomed
with
delight
by
every
scandinavian
audience
but
in
the
matter
was
serious
and
ibsen
meant
it
to
be
so
for
they
were
years
of
ferment
those
six
or
seven
which
intervened
between
his
return
to
christiania
from
bergen
in
and
his
departure
for
italy
in
as
director
of
the
newly
founded
norwegian
theatre
ibsen
was
a
prominent
member
of
the
little
knot
of
brilliant
young
writers
who
led
the
nationalist
revolt
against
danish
literary
tradition
then
still
dominant
in
and
especially
in
official
christiania
and
official
christiania
met
the
revolt
with
contempt
under
such
conditions
the
specific
literary
battle
of
the
norwegian
with
the
dane
easily
developed
into
the
eternal
warfare
of
youthful
idealism
with
respectability
and
convention
ibsen
had
already
started
work
upon
the
greatest
of
his
norse
histories
but
history
was
for
him
little
more
than
material
for
the
illustration
of
modern
problems
and
he
turned
with
zest
from
the
task
of
breathing
his
own
spirit
into
the
stubborn
mould
of
the
thirteenth
century
to
hold
up
the
satiric
mirror
to
the
suburban
of
christiania
and
to
the
varied
phenomena
current
there
and
in
suburban
elsewhere
under
the
name
of
love
yet
is
much
more
than
a
satire
and
its
exuberant
humour
has
a
bitter
core
the
laughter
that
rings
through
it
is
the
harsh
implacable
laughter
of
carlyle
his
criticism
of
commonplace
is
at
first
sight
harmless
and
ordinary
enough
the
ceremonial
formalities
of
the
continental
the
shrill
raptures
of
aunts
and
cousins
over
the
engaged
pair
the
satisfied
smile
of
enterprising
as
she
reckons
up
the
tale
of
daughters
or
of
nieces
safely
married
off
under
her
auspices
or
again
the
embarrassments
incident
to
a
prolonged
following
a
hasty
wooing
the
deadly
effect
of
familiarity
upon
a
shallow
affection
and
the
anxious
efforts
to
save
the
appearance
of
romance
when
its
zest
has
departed
all
these
things
had
yielded
such
comedy
as
they
possess
to
many
others
before
ibsen
and
an
ibsen
was
not
needed
to
evoke
it
but
if
we
ask
what
then
is
the
right
way
from
which
these
cosmic
personages
in
their
several
fashions
diverge
what
is
the
condition
which
will
secure
courtship
from
ridicule
and
marriage
from
disillusion
ibsen
abruptly
parts
company
with
all
his
predecessors
course
reply
the
rest
in
chorus
deep
and
sincere
love
add
some
prudent
good
sense
the
prudent
good
sense
ibsen
allows
but
he
couples
with
it
the
startling
paradox
that
the
first
condition
of
a
happy
marriage
is
the
absence
of
love
and
the
first
condition
of
an
enduring
love
is
the
absence
of
marriage
the
student
of
the
ibsen
is
naturally
somewhat
taken
aback
to
find
the
grim
poet
of
doubt
whose
task
it
seems
to
be
to
apply
a
corrosive
criticism
to
modern
institutions
in
general
and
to
marriage
in
particular
gravely
defending
the
marriage
of
convenience
and
his
amazement
is
not
diminished
by
the
sense
that
the
author
of
this
plea
for
the
loveless
marriage
which
poets
have
at
all
times
scorned
and
derided
was
himself
beyond
question
happily
married
the
truth
is
that
there
are
two
men
in
ibsen
an
idealist
exalted
to
the
verge
of
sentimentality
and
a
critic
hard
inexorable
remorseless
to
the
verge
of
cynicism
what
we
call
his
social
philosophy
is
a
arrived
at
between
them
both
agree
in
repudiating
marriage
for
love
but
the
idealist
repudiates
it
in
the
name
of
love
the
critic
in
the
name
of
marriage
love
for
the
idealist
ibsen
is
a
passion
which
loses
its
virtue
when
it
reaches
its
goal
which
inspires
only
while
it
aspires
and
flags
bewildered
when
it
attains
marriage
for
the
critic
ibsen
is
an
institution
beset
with
pitfalls
into
which
those
are
surest
to
step
who
enter
it
blinded
with
love
in
the
latter
dramas
the
tragedy
of
married
life
is
commonly
generated
by
other
forms
of
blindness
the
childish
innocence
of
nora
the
maidenly
ignorance
of
helena
alving
neither
of
whom
married
precisely
for
love
here
it
is
blind
love
alone
who
to
the
jealous
eye
of
the
critic
plays
the
part
of
the
serpent
in
the
edens
of
wedded
bliss
there
is
it
is
clear
an
element
of
unsolved
contradiction
in
ibsen
thought
love
is
at
once
so
precious
and
so
deadly
a
possession
so
glorious
that
all
other
things
in
life
are
of
less
worth
and
yet
capable
of
producing
only
disastrously
illusive
effects
upon
those
who
have
entered
into
the
relations
to
which
it
prompts
but
with
ibsen
and
it
is
a
grave
intellectual
defect
there
is
an
absolute
antagonism
between
spirit
and
form
an
institution
is
always
with
him
a
shackle
for
the
free
life
of
souls
not
an
organ
through
which
they
attain
expression
and
since
the
institution
of
marriage
can
not
but
be
there
remains
as
the
only
logical
solution
that
which
he
enjoins
to
keep
the
soul
life
out
of
it
to
those
about
to
marry
ibsen
therefore
says
in
effect
be
sure
you
are
not
in
love
and
to
those
who
are
in
love
he
says
part
it
is
easy
to
understand
the
irony
with
which
a
man
who
thought
thus
of
love
contemplated
the
business
of
and
the
ceremonial
discipline
of
continental
courtship
the
whole
unnumbered
tribe
of
wooing
and
plighted
lovers
were
for
him
unconscious
actors
in
a
of
love
contriving
naive
fools
of
fancy
passionately
weaving
the
cords
that
are
to
strangle
passion
comedy
like
this
can
not
be
altogether
gay
and
as
each
fresh
romance
decays
into
routine
and
each
aspiring
passion
goes
out
under
the
spell
of
a
vulgar
environment
or
submits
to
the
bitter
salvation
of
a
final
parting
the
ringing
laughter
grows
harsh
and
hollow
and
notes
of
ineffable
sadness
escape
from
the
poet
stoic
ibsen
had
grown
up
in
a
school
which
cultivated
the
romantic
piquant
picturesque
in
style
which
ran
riot
in
wit
in
vivacious
and
brilliant
imagery
in
resonant
rhythms
and
telling
double
rhymes
it
must
be
owned
that
this
was
not
the
happiest
school
for
a
dramatist
nor
can
be
regarded
in
the
matter
of
style
as
other
than
a
risky
experiment
which
nothing
but
the
sheer
dramatic
force
of
an
ibsen
could
have
carried
through
as
it
is
there
are
palpable
fluctuations
discrepancies
of
manner
the
realism
of
treatment
often
provokes
a
realism
of
style
out
of
keeping
with
the
lyric
afflatus
of
the
verse
and
we
pass
with
little
warning
from
the
barest
colloquial
prose
to
the
strains
of
poetic
fancy
nevertheless
the
style
with
all
its
inequalities
becomes
in
ibsen
hands
a
singularly
plastic
medium
of
dramatic
expression
the
marble
is
too
richly
veined
for
ideal
sculpture
but
it
takes
the
print
of
life
the
wit
exuberant
as
it
is
does
not
coruscate
indiscriminately
upon
all
lips
and
it
has
many
shades
and
varieties
caustic
ironical
imaginative
playful
passionate
which
take
their
temper
from
the
speaker
mood
the
present
version
of
the
play
retains
the
metres
of
the
original
and
follows
it
in
general
line

not

rich
in
well
in

as
others
of

seemed
to
be
stiver

yes
and
i
am
sure
it
could
not
tax

i

dear

were
you
a

miss

my
stiver
yes
stiver
oh
in

miss

to
the

his

halm
yes
we
know
it
stiver
not
now
it
ages
since
i
turned

and

but
in

days

well
you
see
was
when
i
was
in

falk
is
that
time
over
then
have
you
slept
off
the
sweet
intoxication
stiver
i
now
engaged
i
hold

that
better
than
in

i
apprehend
falk
quite
so
you
in
the
right
my
good
old
friend
the
worst
is
past
voila
bien
promoted
from
mere
lover
to
stiver
with
a
smile
of
complacent
recollection
it
strange
to
think
of
it
upon
my
word
i
half
suspect
my
memory
of
lying
turns
to
falk
but
seven
years
ago
it
sounds
absurd
i
wasted
office
hours
in
versifying
falk
what
office
hours
stiver
yes
such
were
my
transgressions
guldstad
ringing
on
his
glass
silence
for
our
solicitor
confessions
stiver
but
chiefly
after
five
when
i
was
free
i
rattle
off
whole
reams
of
poetry
ten
fifteen
folios
ere
i
went
to
bed
falk
i
see
you
gave
your
pegasus
his
head
and
off
he
tore
stiver
on
stamped
or
unstamped
paper
all
the
same
to
him
he
prance
and
caper
falk
the
spring
of
poetry
flowed
no
less
flush
but
how
pray
did
you
teach
it
first
to
gush
stiver
by
aid
of
love
my
friend
miss
jay
it
was
that
taught
me
where
to
bore
my
she
became
so
in
the
end
for
then
she
was
falk
your
love
and
nothing
more
stiver
continuing
was
a
strange
time
i
could
not
read
a
bit
i
tuned
my
pen
instead
of
pointing
it
and
when
along
the
foolscap
sheet
it
raced
it
twangled
music
to
the
words
i
traced
at
last
by
letter
i
declared
my
flame
to
her
to
her
falk
whose
you
became
stiver
in
course
of
post
her
answer
came
to
hand
the
motion
granted
judgment
in
my
favour
falk
and
you
felt
bigger
as
you
wrote
and
braver
to
find
you
brought
your
venture
safe
to
land
stiver
of
course
falk
and
you
bade
the
muse
farewell
stiver
i
felt
no
lyric
impulse
truth
to
tell
from
that
day
forth
my
vein
appeared
to
peter
entirely
out
and
now
if
i
essay
to
turn
a
verse
or
two
for
new
year
day
i
make
the
veriest
hash
of
rhyme
and
metre
and
i
no
notion
what
the
cause
can
be
it
turns
to
law
and
not
to
poetry
guldstad
clinks
glasses
with
him
and
trust
me
you
no
whit
the
worse
for
that
to
falk
you
think
the
stream
of
life
is
flowing
solely
to
bear
you
to
the
goal
you
aiming
at
but
here
i
lodge
a
protest
energetic
say
what
you
will
against
its
wretched
moral
a
masterly
economy
and
new
to
let
the
birds
play
havoc
at
their
pleasure
among
your
fruitless
now
for
you
and
suffer
flocks
and
herds
to
trample
through
your
garden
and
lay
waste
its
springtide
treasure
a
pretty
prospect
truly
for
next
year
falk
oh
next
next
next
the
thought
i
loathe
and
fear
that
these
four
letters
timidly
express
it
beggars
millionaires
in
happiness
if
i
could
be
the
autocrat
of
speech
but
for
one
hour
that
hateful
word
i
banish
i
send
it
packing
out
of
mortal
reach
as
b
and
g
from
knudsen
grammar
vanish
stiver
why
should
the
word
of
hope
enrage
you
thus
falk
because
it
darkens
god
fair
earth
for
us
next
year
next
love
next
life
my
soul
is
vext
to
see
this
world
in
thraldom
to
the
next
is
this
dull
forethought
bent
on
future
prizes
that
millionaires
in
gladness
pauperises
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
it
blurs
the
age
all
rapture
of
the
moment
it
destroys
no
one
dares
taste
in
peace
life
simplest
joys
until
he
struggled
on
another
stage
and
there
arriving
can
he
there
repose
no
to
a
new
next
off
he
flies
again
on
on
unresting
to
the
grave
he
goes
and
god
knows
if
there
any
resting
then
miss
jay
fie
falk
such
sentiments
are
shocking
anna
pensively
oh
i
can
understand
the
feeling
quite
i
am
sure
at
bottom
falk
is
right

must
listen
to
his
mocking
he
rather
too
eccentric
even
my
dear
i
want
you
stiver
occupied
in
cleaning
his
pipe
presently
my
dear
guldstad
to
falk
one
thing
at
least
to
me
is
very
clear
and
this
is
that
you
can
not
but
allow
some
forethought
indispensable
for
see
suppose
that
you
should
write
a
sonnet
and
scorning
forethought
you
should
lavish
on
it
your
last
reserve
your
all
of
poetry
so
that
when
you
set
about
your
next
song
you
should
find
yourself
cleaned
out
heavens
how
your
friends
the
critics
then
would
crow
falk
think
they
notice
i
was
bankrupt
no
once
beggared
of
ideas
i
and
they
would
saunter
arm
in
arm
the
selfsame
way
breaking
off
but
lind
why
what
the
matter
with
you
pray
you
sit
there
dumb
and
dreaming
i
suspect
deep
in
the
mysteries
of
architecture
lind
collecting
himself
i
what
should
make
you
think
so
falk
i
observe
your
eyes
are
glued
to
the
verandah
yonder
you
studying
mayhap
its
arches
curve
or
can
it
be
its
pillars
strength
you
ponder
the
door
perhaps
with
hammered
iron
hinges
from
something
there
your
glances
never
wander
lind
no
you
are
wrong
i
just
absorbed
in
being
drunk
with
the
hour
naught
craving
naught
foreseeing
i
feel
as
though
i
stood
my
life
complete
with
all
earth
riches
scattered
at
my
feet
thanks
for
your
song
of
happiness
and
spring
from
out
my
inmost
heart
it
seemed
to
spring
lifts
his
glass
and
exchanges
a
glance
unobserved
with
anna
here
to
the
blossom
in
its
fragrant
pride
what
reck
we
of
the
fruit
of
empties
his
glass
falk
looks
at
him
with
surprise
and
emotion
but
assumes
a
light
tone
behold
fair
ladies
though
you
scorn
me
quite
here
i
have
made
an
easy
proselyte
his
yesterday
was
all
he
cared
for
dithyrambics
he
prepared
for
we
poets
must
be
born
cries
every
judge
but
now
and
then
like
strasburg
geese
gorge
themselves
so
inhumanly
obese
on
rhyming
balderdash
and
rhythmic
fudge
that
when
cleaned
out
their
very
souls
are
thick
with
lyric
lard
and
greasy
rhetoric
to
lind
your
praise
however
i
shall
not
forget
we
sweep
the
lyre
henceforward
in
duet
miss
jay
you
falk
are
hard
at
work
no
doubt
here
in
these
rural
solitudes
delightful
where
at
your
own
sweet
will
you
roam
about
halm
smiling
oh
no
his
laziness
is
something
frightful
miss
jay
what
here
at
halm
that
most
surprising
surely
it
just
the
place
for
poetising
pointing
to
the
right
that
for
instance
in
the
wood
sequestered
name
me
any
place
that
could
be
more
conducive
to
poetic
mood
falk
let
blindness
veil
the
sunlight
from
mine
eyes
i
chant
the
splendour
of
the
sunlit
skies
just
for
a
season
let
me
beg
or
borrow
a
great
a
crushing
a
stupendous
sorrow
and
soon
you
hear
my
hymns
of
gladness
rise
but
best
miss
jay
to
nerve
my
wings
for
flight
find
me
a
maid
to
be
my
life
my
light
for
that
incitement
long
to
heaven
i
pleaded
but
hitherto
worse
luck
it
has
heeded
miss
jay
what
levity
halm
yes
most
irreverent
falk
pray
do
imagine
it
was
my
intent
to
live
with
her
on
bread
and
cheese
and
kisses
no
just
upon
the
threshold
of
our
blisses
kind
heaven
must
snatch
away
the
gift
it
lent
i
need
a
little
spiritual
gymnastic
the
dose
in
that
form
surely
would
be
drastic
svanhild
has
during
the
talk
approached
she
stands
close
to
the
table
and
says
in
a
determined
but
whimsical
tone
i
pray
that
such
may
be
your
destiny
but
when
it
finds
you
bear
it
like
a
man
falk
turning
round
in
surprise
miss
svanhild
well
i
do
the
best
i
can
but
think
you
i
may
trust
implicitly
to
finding
your
petitions
efficacious
heaven
as
you
know
to
faith
alone
is
gracious
and
though
you
doubtless
will
enough
for
two
to
make
me
bid
my
peace
of
mind
adieu
have
you
the
faith
to
carry
matters
through
that
is
the
question
svanhild
half
in
jest
wait
till
sorrow
comes
and
all
your
being
springtide
chills
and
numbs
wait
till
it
gnaws
and
rends
you
soon
and
late
then
tell
me
if
my
faith
is
adequate
she
goes
across
to
the
ladies
halm
aside
to
her
can
you
two
never
be
at
peace
you
made
poor
falk
quite
angry
i
afraid
continues
reprovingly
in
a
low
voice
miss
jay
joins
in
the
conversation
svanhild
remains
cold
and
silent
falk
after
a
pause
of
reflection
goes
over
to
the
then
to
himself
with
fullest
confidence
her
glances
lightened
shall
i
believe
as
she
does
so
securely
that
heaven
intends
guldstad
no
hang
it
do
be
frightened
the
powers
above
would
be
demented
surely
to
give
effect
to
orders
such
as
these
no
my
good
sir
the
cure
for
your
disease
is
exercise
for
muscle
nerve
and
sinew
do
lie
there
wasting
all
the
grit
that
in
you
in
idle
dreams
cut
wood
if
that
were
all
and
then
i
say
the
devil
i
indeed
if
one
brief
fortnight
does
not
find
you
freed
from
all
your
whimsies
falk
fetter
by
choice
like
burnell
ass
i
ponder
the
flesh
on
this
side
and
the
spirit
yonder
which
were
it
wiser
i
should
go
for
first
guldstad
filling
the
glasses
first
have
some
punch
that
quenches
ire
and
thirst
halm
looking
at
her
watch
ha
eight
my
watch
is
either
fast
or
it
just
the
time
we
may
expect
the
pastor
rises
and
puts
things
in
order
on
the
verandah
falk
what
have
we
parsons
coming
miss
jay
do
you
know
halm
i
told
you
just
a
little
while
ago
anna
no
mother
falk
had
not
yet
come
halm
why
no
that
true
but
pray
do
look
so
glum
trust
me
you
be
enchanted
with
his
visit
falk
a
clerical
enchanter
pray
who
is
it
halm
why
pastor
strawman
not
unknown
to
fame
falk
indeed
oh
yes
i
think
i
heard
his
name
and
read
that
in
the
legislative
game
he
comes
to
take
a
hand
with
voice
and
vote
stiver
he
speaks
superbly
guldstad
when
he
cleared
his
throat
miss
jay
he
coming
with
his
wife
halm
and
all
their
blessings
falk
to
give
them
three
or
four
days
treat
poor
dears
soon
he
be
buried
over
head
and
ears
in
swedish
muddles
and
official
messings
i
see
halm
to
falk
now
there
a
man
for
you
in
truth
guldstad
they
say
he
was
a
rogue
though
in
his
youth
miss
jay
offended
there
guldstad
i
must
break
a
lance
i
heard
as
long
as
i
can
recollect
most
worthy
people
speak
with
great
respect
of
pastor
strawman
and
his
life
romance
guldstad
laughing
romance
miss
jay
romance
i
call
a
match
romantic
at
which
mere
worldly
wisdom
looks
askance
falk
you
make
my
curiosity
gigantic
miss
jay
continuing
but
certain
people
always
grow
splenetic
why
goodness
knows
at
everything
pathetic
and
scoff
it
down
we
all
know
how
of
late
an
unfledged
upstart
undergraduate
presumed
with
brazen
insolence
to
declare
that
william
russell
was
a
poor
affair
falk
but
what
has
this
to
do
with
strawman
pray
is
he
a
poem
or
a
christian
play
miss
jay
with
tears
of
emotion
no
falk
a
man
with
heart
as
large
as
day
but
when
a
so
to
speak
mere
lifeless
thing
can
put
such
venom
into
envy
sting
and
stir
up
evil
passions
fierce
and
fell
of
such
a
depth
falk
sympathetically
and
such
a
length
as
well
miss
jay
why
then
a
man
of
your
commanding
brain
ca
fail
to
see
falk
oh
yes
that
very
plain
but
hitherto
i
have
quite
made
out
the
nature
style
and
plot
of
this
romance
it
something
quite
delightful
i
no
doubt
but
just
a
little
inkling
in
advance
stiver
i
will
abstract
in
rapid
the
leading
points
miss
jay
no
i
am
more
i
know
the
ins
and
outs
halm
i
know
them
too
miss
jay
oh
halm
now
let
me
tell
it
do
well
falk
you
see
he
passed
at
college
for
quite
a
miracle
of
wit
and
knowledge
had
admirable
taste
in
books
and
dress
halm
and
acted
privately
with
great
success
miss
jay
yes
wait
a
bit
he
painted
played
and
wrote
halm
and
do
forget
his
gift
of
anecdote
miss
jay
do
give
me
time
i
know
the
whole
affair
he
made
some
verses
set
them
to
an
air
also
his
own
and
found
a
publisher
o
heavens
with
what
romantic
melancholy
he
played
and
sang
his
madrigals
to
molly
halm
he
was
a
genius
the
simple
fact
guldstad
to
himself
hm
some
were
of
opinion
he
was
cracked
falk
a
gray
old
stager
whose
sagacious
head
was
never
upon
mouldy
parchments
fed
says
love
makes
petrarchs
just
as
many
lambs
and
little
occupation
abrahams
but
who
was
molly
miss
jay
molly
his
elect
his
whom
shortly
we
expect
of
a
great
firm
her
father
was
a
member
guldstad
a
timber
house
miss
jay
curtly
i
really
not
aware
guldstad
did
a
large
trade
in
scantlings
i
remember
miss
jay
that
is
the
trivial
side
of
the
affair
falk
a
firm
miss
jay
continuing
of
vast
resources
i
informed
you
can
imagine
how
the
suitors
swarm
gentlemen
of
the
highest
halm
even
a
baronet
made
application
miss
jay
but
molly
was
not
to
be
made
their
catch
she
had
met
strawman
upon
private
stages
to
see
him
was
to
love
him
falk
and
despatch
the
wooing
gentry
home
without
their
wages
halm
was
it
not
just
a
too
romantic
match
miss
jay
and
then
there
was
a
terrible
old
father
whose
sport
was
thrusting
happy
souls
apart
she
had
a
guardian
also
as
i
gather
to
add
fresh
torment
to
her
tortured
heart
but
each
of
them
was
loyal
to
his
vow
a
cottage
and
a
ewe
they
dream
of
just
enough
to
nourish
two
halm
or
at
the
very
uttermost
a
cow
miss
jay
in
short
i
heard
it
from
the
lips
of
both
a
beck
a
byre
two
bosoms
and
one
troth
falk
ah
yes
and
then
miss
jay
she
broke
with
kin
and
class
falk
she
broke
halm
broke
with
them
falk
there
a
plucky
lass
miss
jay
and
fled
to
strawman
garret
falk
how
without
ahem
the
priestly
consecration
miss
jay
shame
halm
fy
fy
my
late
beloved
husband
name
was
on
the
list
of
sponsors
stiver
to
miss
jay
the
one
room
not
housing
sheep
and
cattle
i
presume
miss
jay
to
stiver
o
but
you
must
consider
this
my
friend
there
is
no
where
love
the
guiding
star
all
right
without
if
tender
troth
within
to
falk
he
loved
her
to
the
notes
of
the
guitar
and
she
gave
lessons
on
the
violin
halm
then
all
of
course
on
credit
they
bespoke
guldstad
till
in
a
year
the
timber
merchant
broke
halm
then
strawman
had
a
call
to
north
miss
jay
and
there
vowed
in
a
letter
that
i
saw
as
few
did
he
lived
but
for
his
duty
and
for
her
falk
as
if
completing
her
statement
and
with
those
words
his
life
romance
concluded
halm
rising
how
if
we
should
go
out
upon
the
lawn
and
see
if
there
no
prospect
of
them
yet
miss

drawing
on
her
mantle

svanhild
will
you

ah
ditto
lind
falk
your

vehement
it
will
perforce
break

hullo
there
you
must
first
be
tried

and
hanging
follow
in
due
course
now
what
on
earth
the
matter
to
conceal
from
me
your
friend
this
treasure
of
your
finding
for
you
confess
the
inference
is
binding
you
come
into
a
prize
off

lind
i
snared
and
taken

blessed

falk
how
living
and
undamaged
by
the
steel
lind
patience
i
tell
the
matter
in
one
word
i
am
engaged
conceive
falk
quickly
engaged
lind
it
true
with
unimagined
courage
swelling
i
said
ahem
it
will
not
bear
but
only
think
the
sweet
young
maiden
grew
quite
but
not
at
all
enraged
you
see
falk
what
i
ventured
for
a
bride
she
listened
and
i
rather
think
she
cried
that
sure
means
yes
falk
if
precedents
decide
go
on
lind
and
so
we
really
are
engaged
falk
i
should
conclude
so
but
the
only
way
to
be
quite
certain
is
to
ask
miss
jay
lind
o
no
i
feel
so
confident
so
clear
so
perfectly
assured
and
void
of
fear
radiantly
in
a
mysterious
tone
hark
i
had
leave
her
fingers
to
caress
when
from
the
she
drew
the
cover
falk
lifting
and
emptying
his
glass
well
flowers
of
spring
your
wedding
garland

the

i
swear
by
heaven
that
i
will
love
her
until
i
die
with
love
as
infinite
as
now
glows
in
me
for
she
is
so
sweet
falk
engaged
aha
so
that
was
why
you
flung
the
holy
law
and
prophets
on
the
shelf
lind
laughing
and
you
believed
it
was
the
song
you
sung
falk
a
poet
believes
all
things
of
himself
lind
seriously
do
think
however
falk
that
i
dismiss
the
theologian
from
my
hour
of
bliss
only
i
find
the
book
will
not
suffice
as
jacob

unto

into

a
boundless

moment
and
paces
up

down
in

falk
half
to
himself
yes
is
there
the
same
the
shadow
in
her
eyes
deep
mirror
sleeping
the
roguish
elf
about
her
lips
it
is
there
svanhild
what
you
frighten
me
falk
your
name
is
svanhild
svanhild
yes
you
know
it
very
well
falk
but
do
you
know
the
name
is
laughable
i
beg
you
to
discard
it
from
svanhild
that
would
be
far
beyond
a
daughter
right
falk
laughing
hm
svanhild
svanhild
with
sudden
gravity
with
your
earliest
breath
how
came
you
by
this
prophecy
of
death
svanhild
is
it
so
grim
falk
no
lovely
as
a
song
but
for
our
age
too
great
and
stern
and
strong
how
can
a
modern
demoiselle
fill
out
the
ideal
that
heroic
name
expresses
no
no
discard
it
with
your
outworn
dresses
svanhild
you
mean
the
mythical
princess
no
doubt
falk
who
guiltless
died
beneath
the
horse
feet
svanhild
but
now
such
acts
are
clearly
obsolete
no
no
i
mount
his
saddle
there
my
place
how
often
have
i
dreamt
in
pensive
ease
he
bore
me
buoyant
through
the
world
apace
his
mane
a
flag
of
freedom
in
the
breeze
falk
yes
the
old
tale
in
pensive
ease
no
mortal
is
stopped
by
thwarting
bar
or
cullis
portal
fearless
we
cleave
the
ether
without
bound
in
practice
tho
we
shrewdly
hug
the
ground
for
all
love
life
and
having
choice
will
choose
it
and
no
man
dares
to
leap
where
he
may
lose
it
svanhild
yes
show
me
but
the
end
i
spurn
the
shore
but
let
the
end
be
worth
the
leaping
for
a
ballarat
beyond
the
desert
sands
else
each
will
stay
exactly
where
he
stands
falk
sarcastically
i
grasp
the
case
the
due
conditions
fail
svanhild
eagerly
exactly
what
the
use
of
spreading
sail
when
there
is
not
a
breath
of
wind
astir
falk
ironically
yes
what
the
use
of
plying
whip
and
spur
when
there
is
not
a
penny
of
reward
for
him
who
tears
him
from
the
festal
board
and
mounts
and
dashes
headlong
to
perdition
such
doing
for
the
deed
sake
asks
a
knight
and
knighthood
now
an
idle
superstition
that
was
your
meaning
possibly
svanhild
quite
right
look
at
that
fruit
tree
in
the
orchard
close
no
blossom
on
its
barren
branches
blows
you
should
have
seen
last
year
with
what
brave
airs
it
staggered
underneath
its
world
of
pears
falk
uncertain
no
doubt
but
what
the
moral
you
impute
svanhild
with
finesse
o
among
other
things
the
bold
unreason
of
modern
zacharies
who
seek
for
fruit
if
the
tree
blossom
to
excess
last
season
you
must
not
crave
the
blossoms
back
in
this
falk
i
knew
you
find
your
footing
in
the
ways
of
old
romance
svanhild
yes
modern
virtue
is
of
quite
another
stamp
who
now
arrays
himself
to
battle
for
the
truth
who
stake
his
life
and
person
fearless
for
truth
sake
where
is
the
hero
falk
looking
keenly
at
her
where
is
the
valkyria
svanhild
shaking
her
head
valkyrias
find
no
market
in
this
land
when
the
faith
lately
was
assailed
in
syria
did
you
go
out
with
the
no
but
on
paper
you
were
warm
and
willing
and
sent
the
clerical
gazette
a
shilling
pause
falk
is
about
to
retort
but
checks
himself
and
goes
into
the
garden
svanhild
after
watching
him
a
moment
approaches
him
and
asks
gently
falk
are
you
angry
falk
no
i
only
brood
svanhild
with
thoughtful
sympathy
you
seem
to
be
two
natures
still
at
feud
unreconciled
falk
i
know
it
well
svanhild
impetuously
but
why
falk
losing
why
why
because
i
hate
to
go
about
with
soul
bared
boldly
to
the
vulgar
eye
as
jock
and
jennie
hang
their
passions
out
to
wear
my
glowing
heart
upon
my
sleeve
like
women
in
low
dresses
you
alone
svanhild
you
only
you
i
did
believe
well
it
is
past
that
dream
for
ever
she
goes
to
the
and
looks
out
he
follows
you
listen
svanhild
to
another
voice
that
sings
hark
every
evening
when
the
sun
at
rest
a
little
bird
floats
hither
on
beating
wings
see
there
it
darted
from
its
leafy
nest
and
do
you
know
it
is
my
faith
as
oft
as
god
makes
any
songless
soul
he
sends
a
little
bird
to
be
her
friend
of
friends
and
sing
for
ever
in
her
falk
picking
up
a
stone
then
must
the
owner
and
the
bird
be
near
or
its
song
squandered
on
a
stranger
ear
svanhild
yes
that
is
true
but
i
discovered
mine
of
speech
and
song
i
am
denied
the
power
but
when
it
warbles
in
its
leafy
bower
poems
flow
in
upon
my
brain
like
wine
ah
yes
they
fleet
they
are
not
to
be
won
falk
throws
the
stone
svanhild
screams
o
god
you
hit
it
ah
what
have
you
done
she
hurries
out
to
the
the
right
and
then
quickly
returns
o
pity
pity
falk
in
passionate
agitation
no
but
eye
for
eye
svanhild
and
tooth
for
tooth
now
you
attend
no
further
greetings
from
your
no
guerdon
from
the
land
of
melody
that
is
my
vengeance
as
you
slew
i
slay
svanhild
i
slew
falk
you
slew
until
this
very
day
a
warbled
in
my
soul
see
now
one
passing
bell
for
both
may
toll
you
killed
it
svanhild
have
i
falk
yes
for
you
have
slain
my
young
joyous
exultation
contemptuously
by
your
betrothal
svanhild
how
but
pray
explain
falk
o
it
in
full
accord
with
expectation
he
gets
his
licence
enters
orders
speeds
to
a
post
as
missionary
in
the
west
svanhild
in
the
same
tone
a
pretty
penny
also
he
succeeds
to
for
it
is
lind
you
speak
of
falk
you
know
best
of
whom
i
speak
svanhild
with
a
subdued
smile
as
the
bride
sister
true
i
can
not
help
falk
great
god
it
is
not
you
svanhild
who
win
this
overplus
of
bliss
ah
no
falk
with
almost
childish
joy
it
is
not
you
o
god
be
glorified
what
love
what
mercy
does
he
not
bestow
i
shall
not
see
you
as
another
bride
but
the
fire
of
pain
he
bade
me
bear
tries
to
seize
her
hand
o
hear
me
svanhild
hear
me
then
svanhild
pointing
quickly
to
the
background
see
there
she
goes
towards
the
house
at
the
same
moment

glancing
at

colour

high

in
stiver
to
falk
what
is
the
colour
of
this
parson
coat
falk
i
guess
would
not
catch
his
vote
stiver
how
if
one
made
allusion
to
the
store
of
verses
yet
unpublished
in
my
drawer
falk
it
might
do
something

to

i
try
they

i
ca
endure

must
present
her
falk

and
announce
your
union
to
the

lind
other
reflections
also
weigh
with
me
and
one
of
more
especial
gravity
say
that
there
lurked
among
our
motley
band
some
sneaking
sly
pretender
to
her
hand
say
his
attentions
became
undisguised
we
should
be
disagreeably
compromised
falk
yes
it
is
true
it

escaped
my
mind

a
higher
office
were
designed

as
his
young
licentiate
has
retained
you
shortly
you
get
a
permanent
position

it

directions
falk
looking
after

so
to
the
ruin
of
his
youth
he
goes
guldstad
who
has
meantime
been
conversing
on
the
steps
with
halm
and
miss
jay
approaches
falk
and
slaps
him
on
the
shoulder
well
brooding
on
a
poem
falk
no
a
play
guldstad
the
deuce
i
never
heard
it
was
your
line
falk
o
no
the
author
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
your
acquaintance
also
i
daresay
the
knave
a
dashing
writer
never
doubt
only
imagine
in
a
single
day
he
worked
a
perfect
little
idyll
out
guldstad
slily
with
happy
ending
doubtless
falk
you
aware
no
curtain
falls
but
on
a
plighted
pair
thus
with
the
trilogy
first
part
we
reckoned
but
now
the
poet
begin
the
comedy
of
part
the
second
thro
five
insipid
acts
he
has
to
spin
and
of
that
staple
finally
compose
part
third
or
wedlock
tragedy
in
prose
guldstad
smiling
the
poet
vein
is
catching
it
would
seem
falk
really
how
so
pray
guldstad
since
i
also
pore
and
ponder
over
a
poetic
scheme
mysteriously
an
actuality
and
not
a
dream
falk
and
pray
who
is
the
hero
of
your
theme
guldstad
i
tell
you
that
not
before
falk
it
is
yourself
guldstad
you
think
me
equal
to
it
falk
i
sure
no
other
mortal
man
could
do
it
but
then
the
heroine
no
city
maid
i
swear
but
of
the
country
breathing
balm
guldstad
lifting
his
finger
ah
that
the
point
and
must
not
be
betrayed
changing
his
tone
pray
tell
me
your
opinion
of
miss
halm
falk
o
you
best
able
to
pronounce
upon
her
my
voice
can
neither
credit
nor
dishonour
smiling
but
just
take
care
no
blot
this
fine
poetic
scheme
of
which
you
talk
suppose
i
were
so
shameless
as
to
balk
the
meditated
climax
of
the
plot
guldstad
well
i
would
cry
amen
and
change
my
plan
falk
what
guldstad
why
you
see
you
are
a
letter
man
how
monstrous
were
it
if
your
skill
design
were
ruined
by
a
bungler
hand
like
mine
retires
to
the
background
falk
in
passing
to
lind
yes
you
were
right
the
merchant
really
scheming
the
ruin
of
your
happiness
lind
aside
to
anna
now

you
see
my
doubting

not
dreaming

go
this
very
moment
and
confess
they
approach
halm
who
is
standing
with
miss
jay
by
the
house
guldstad
conversing
with
stiver

a
fine
evening

very
likely
when
a
man
disposed
guldstad
facetiously
what

up

with
your
engagement

that
about
the
truth

hurrah
your
spendthrift
pocket
has
a
groat
or
two
still
left

seems
of
poetry
stiver
stiffly
i
can
not
see
what
poetry
has
got
to
do
with
my
engagement
or
with
me
falk
you
are
not
meant
to
see
when
lovers
prove
what
love
is
all

over
with
their
love
guldstad
to
stiver
but
if
there
matter
for
adjustment

let
hear
it

pondering
all

ayes
are
balanced
by
the
noes
falk
i
right
you
in
one
sentence
ever
since
as
plighted
lover
you
were
first
installed
you
felt
yourself
if
i
may
say
so
galled
stiver
and
sometimes
to
the
quick
falk
you
had
to
wince
beneath
a
crushing
load
of
obligations
that
you
send
packing
if
good
form
permitted
that
what
the
matter
stiver
monstrous
accusations

legal
debts

honestly
acquitted

man
weds

see
he
gets
a
wife
falk

all
you
wanted
and
a

each
captive
bond
and
set
you

all
this
about
explain
explain
guldstad
laughingly
to

clear
your
mind
of
all
this
balderdash
what
do
you
want
stiver
pulling
himself
together
a
trifling
loan
in
cash
falk
a
loan
stiver
hurriedly
to
guldstad
that
is
i

miss

to

well
there
will
come
a

with

falk
hold
as
a
plighted
man
you
are
a
member
of
rapture
observe
it
rules
no
orgies
here
remember
turning
to
guldstad
sympathetically
well
my
good
sir
guldstad
beaming
with
pleasure
i
think
this
promises
all
happiness
for
both
falk
staring
at
him
you
seem
to
stand
the
shock
with
exemplary
that
well
guldstad
what
do
you
mean
sir
falk
only
this
that
inasmuch
as
you
appeared
to
feed
fond
expectations
of
your
own
guldstad
indeed
falk
at
any
rate
you
were
upon
the
scent
you
named
miss
halm
you
stood
upon
this
spot
and
asked
me
guldstad
smiling
there
are
two
though
are
there
not
falk
it
was
the
other
sister
that
you
meant
guldstad
that
sister
yes
the
other
one
just
so
judge
for
yourself
when
you
have
come
to
know
that
sister
better
if
she
has
not
in
her
merits
which
if
they
were
divined
would
win
her
a
little
more
regard
than
we
bestow
falk
coldly
her
virtues
are
of
every
known
variety
i
sure
guldstad
not
quite
the
accent
of
society
she
can
not
hit
exactly
there
she
loses
falk
a
grievous
fault
guldstad
but
if
her
mother
chooses
to
spend
a
winter
on
her
she
come
out
of
it
queen

i
thinking
of
the

they
go
out
to
the

falk
who
has
been
continuously
watching
strawman
and
his
wife
remains
behind
alone
in
the
garden
it
is
now
dark
the
house
is
lighted
up
falk
all
is
as
if
burnt
out
all
desolate
dead
so
thro
the
world
they
wander
two
and
two
charred
wreckage
like
the
blackened
stems
that
strew
the
forest
when
the
withering
fire
is
fled
far
as
the
eye
can
travel
all
is
drought
and
nowhere
peeps
one
spray
of
verdure
out
svanhild
comes
out
on
to
the
verandah
with
a
flowering
which
she
sets
down
yes
one
yes
one
svanhild
falk
in
the
dark
falk
and
fearless
darkness
to
me
is
fair
and
light
is
cheerless
but
are
not
you
afraid
in
yonder
walls
where
the
lamp
light
on
sallow
corpses
falls
svanhild
shame
falk
looking
after
strawman
who
appears
at
the
window
he
was
once
so
brilliant
and
strong
warred
with
the
world
to
win
his
mistress

for
custom
doughtiest
iconoclast
and
pored
forth
love
in
paeans
of
glad
song
look
at
him
now
in
solemn
robes
and
wraps
a
drama
on
his
own
collapse
and
she
the
slattern
with
the
shoes
that
squeak
and
clatter
in
her
traces
this
is
the
winged
maid
who
was
his

svanhild
yes
it
is
wretched
wretched
past
compare
i
know
of
no

i

then
let
us
two
rise
up
and
bid
defiance
to
this

no

philistine

one
aim

be

free
and
true
in
that
i
am
not
wanting
nor
are
you
a
fiery
spirit
pulses
in
your

for
thoughts
that
master
you
have
works
that
burn
the
corslet
of
convention
that
constrains
the
beating
hearts
of
other

you
spurn
the
voice
that
you
were
born
with
will
not
chime
to
the
chorus
custom
baton
gives
the
time
to
svanhild
and
do
you
think
pain
has
not
often
pressed
tears
from
my
eyes
and
quiet
from
my
breast
i
longed
to
shape
my
way
to
my
own
bent
falk
in
pensive
ease
svanhild
o
no
was
sternly
meant
but
then
the
aunts
came
in
with
advice
the
matter
must
be
sifted
weighed
coming
nearer
in
pensive
ease
you
say
oh
no
i
made
a
bold
experiment
in
art
falk
which
ended
svanhild
in
failure
i
lacked
talent
for
the
brush
the
thirst
for
freedom
tho
i
could
not
crush
checked
at
the
easel
it
essayed
the
stage
falk
that
plan
was
shattered
also
i
engage
svanhild
upon
the
eldest
aunt
suggestion
yes
she
much
preferred
a
place
as
governess
falk
but
of
all
this
i
never
heard
a
word
svanhild
smiling
no
wonder
they
took
care
that
none
was
heard
they
trembled
at
the
risk
my
future
ran
if
this
were
whispered
to
unmarried
man
falk
after
gazing
a
moment
at
her
in
meditative
sympathy
that
such
must
be
your
lot
i
long
had
guessed
when
first
i
met
you
i
can
well
recall
you
seemed
to
me
quite
other
than
the
rest
beyond
the
comprehension
of
them
all
they
sat
at
table
fragrant
tea
and
humming
with
the
tea
in
tune
the
young
girls
blushing
and
the
young
men
cooing
like
pigeons
on
a
sultry
afternoon
old
maids
and
matrons
volubly
averred
morality
and
faith
supreme
felicity
young
wives
were
loud
in
praise
of
domesticity
while
you
stood
lonely
like
a
mateless
bird
and
when
at
last
the
gabbling
clamour
rose
to
a
a
debauch
of
prose
you
seemed
a
piece
of
silver
newly
minted
among
foul
notes
and
coppers
dulled
and
dinted
you
were
a
coin
imported
alien
strange
here
valued
at
another
rate
of
change
not
passing
current
in
that
babel
mart
of
poetry
and
butter
cheese
and
art
then
while
miss
jay
in
triumph
took
the
field
svanhild
gravely
her
knight
behind
her
like
a
champion
bold
his
hat
upon
his
elbow
like
a
shield
falk
your
mother
nodded
to
your
untouched
cup
drink
svanhild
dear
before
your
tea
grows
cold
and
then
you
drank
the
vapid
liquor
up
the
mawkish
brew
beloved
of
young
and
old
but
that
name
gripped
me
with
a
sudden
spell
the
grim
old
volsungs
as
they
fought
and
fell
with
all
their
faded
aeons
seemed
to
rise
in
line
before
my
eyes
in
you
i
saw
a
svanhild
like
the
old
but
fashioned
to
the
modern
age
mould
sick
of
its
hollow
warfare
is
the
world
its
lying
banner
it
would
fain
have
furled
but
when
the
world
does
evil
its
offence
is
blotted
in
the
blood
of
innocence
svanhild
with
gentle
irony
i
think
at
any
rate
the
fumes
of
tea
must
answer
for
that
direful
fantasy
but
is
your
least
achievement
past
dispute
to
hear
the
spirit
speaking
when
is
mute
falk
with
emotion
nay
svanhild
do
not
jest
behind
your
scoff
tears
glitter
o
i
see
them
plain
enough
and
i
see
more
when
you
to
dust
are
fray
and
kneaded
to
a
formless
lump
of
clay
each
bungling
dilettante
on
you
his
dull
devices
shall
display
the
world
usurps
the
creature
of
god
hand
and
sets
its
image
in
the
place
of
his
transforms
enlarges
that
part
lightens
this
and
when
upon
the
pedestal
you
stand
complete
cries
out
in
triumph
now
she
is
at
last
what
woman
ought
to
be
behold
how
plastically
calm
how
bathed
in
the
lamplight
soft
irradiation
how
well
in
keeping
with
the
decoration
seizing
her
hand
but
if
you
are
to
die
live
first
come
forth
with
me
into
the
glory
of
god
earth
soon
soon
the
gilded
cage
will
claim
its
prize
the
lady
thrives
there
but
the
woman
dies
and
i
love
nothing
but
the
woman
in
you
there
if
they
will
let
others
woo
and
win
you
but
here
my
spring
of
life
began
to
shoot
here
my
put
forth
its
firstling
fruit
here
i
found
wings
and
flight
svanhild
i
know
it
only
be
mine
here
i
shall
grow
a
poet
svanhild
in
gentle
reproof
withdrawing
her
hand
o
why
have
you
betrayed
yourself
how
sweet
it
was
when
we
as
friends
could
freely
meet
you
should
have
kept
your
counsel
can
we
stake
our
bliss
upon
a
word
that
we
may
break
now
you
have
spoken
all
is
over
falk
no
i
pointed
to
the
goal
now
leap
with
me
my
svanhild
if
you
dare
and
show
that
you
have
heart
and
courage
to
be
free
svanhild
be
free
falk
yes
free
for
freedom
is
absolutely
to
fulfil
our
call
and
you
by
heaven
were
destined
i
know
well
to
be
my
bulwark
against
beauty
spell
i
like
my
falcon
namesake
have
to
swing
against
the
wind
if
i
would
reach
the
sky
you
are
the
breeze
i
must
be
breasted
by
you
only
you
put
vigour
in
my
wing
be
mine
be
mine
until
the
world
shall
take
you
when
leaves
are
falling
then
our
paths
shall
part
sing
unto
me
the
treasures
of
your
heart
and
for
each
song
another
song
i
make
you
so
may
you
pass
into
the
lamplit
glow
of
age
as
forests
fade
without
a
throe
svanhild
with
suppressed
bitterness
i
can
not
thank
you
for
your
words
betray
the
meaning
of
your
kind
solicitude
you
eye
me
as
a
boy
a
sallow
good
to
cut
and
play
the
flute
on
for
a
day
falk
yes
better
than
to
linger
in
the
swamp
till
autumn
choke
it
with
her
grey
mists
damp
vehemently
you
must
you
shall
to
me
you
must
present
what
god
to
you
so
bountifully
lent
i
speak
in
song
what
you
in
dreams
have
meant
see
yonder
bird
i
innocently
slew
her
warbling
was
song
book
of
books
for
you
o
yield
your
music
as
she
yielded
hers
my
life
shall
be
that
music
set
to
verse
svanhild
and
when
you
know
me
when
my
songs
are
flown
and
my
last
requiem
chanted
from
the
bough
what
then
falk
observing
her
what
then
ah
well
remember
now
pointing
to
the
garden
svanhild
gently
yes
i
remember
you
can
drive
a
stone
falk
with
a
scornful
laugh
this
is
your
vaunted
soul
of
freedom
therefore
all
daring
if
it
had
an
end
to
dare
for
vehemently
i
shown
you
one
now
once
for
all
your
yea
or
nay
svanhild
you
know
the
answer
i
must
make
you
i
never
can
accept
you
in
your
way
falk
coldly
breaking
off
then
there
an
end
of
it
the
world
may
take
you
svanhild
has
silently
turned
away
she
supports
her
hands
upon
the
verandah
railing
and
rests
her
head
upon
them
falk
walks
several
times
up
and
down
takes
a
cigar
stops
near
her
and
says
after
a
pause
you
think
the
topic
of
my
talk
extremely
ludicrous
i
should
not
wonder
pauses
for
an
answer
svanhild
is
silent
i
very
conscious
that
it
was
a
blunder
sister
and
daughter
love
alone
possess
you
henceforth
i
wear
kid
gloves
when
i
address
you
sure
so
of
being
understood
aright
pauses
but
as
svanhild
remains
motionless
he
turns
and
goes
towards
the
right
svanhild
lifting
her
head
after
a
brief
silence
looking
at
him
and
drawing
near
now
i
will
recompense
your
kind
intent
to
save
me
with
an
earnest
admonition
that
gave
me
sudden
vision
what
your
emancipation
really
meant
you
said
you
were
the
falcon
that
must
fight
athwart
the
wind
if
it
would
reach
the
sky
i
was
the
breeze
you
must
be
breasted
by
else
vain
were
all
your
faculty
of
flight
how
pitifully
mean
how
paltry
nay
how
ludicrous
as
you
yourself
divined
that
seed
however
fell
not
by
the
way
but
bred
another
fancy
in
my
mind
of
a
far
more
illuminating
kind
you
as
i
saw
it
were
no
falcon
but
a
tuneful
dragon
out
of
paper
cut
whose
ego
holds
a
secondary
station
dependent
on
the
string
for
animation
its
breast
was
scrawled
with
promises
to
pay
in
cash
poetic
at
some
future
day
the
wings
were
stiff
with
barbs
and
shafts
of
wit
that
wildly
beat
the
air
but
never
hit
the
tail
was
a
satiric
rod
in
pickle
to
castigate
the
town
infirmities
but
all
it
compass
was
to
lightly
tickle
the
casual
doer
of
some
small
amiss
so
you
lay
helpless
at
my
feet
imploring
o
raise
me
how
and
where
is
all
the
same
give
me
the
power
of
singing
and
of
soaring
no
matter
at
what
cost
of
bitter
blame
falk
clenching
his
fists
in
inward
agitation
heaven
be
my
witness
svanhild
no
you
must
be
told
for
such
a
childish
sport
i
am
too
old
but
you
whom
nature
made
for
high
endeavour
are
you
content
the
fields
of
air
to
tread
hanging
your
poet
life
upon
a
thread
that
at
my
pleasure
i
can
slip
and
sever
falk
hurriedly
what
is
the
date
svanhild
more
gently
why
now
that
right
mind
well
this
day
and
heed
it
and
beware
trust
to
your
own
wings
only
for
your
flight
sure
if
they
do
not
break
that
they
will
bear
the
paper
poem
for
the
desk
is
fit
that
which
is
lived
alone
has
life
in
it
that
only
has
the
wings
that
scale
the
height
choose
now
between
them
poet
be
or
write
nearer
to
him
now
i
have
done
what
you
besought
me
now
my
requiem
is
chanted
from
the
bough
my
only
one
now
all
my
songs
are
flown
now
if
you
will
i
ready
for
the
stone
she
goes
into
the
house
falk
remains
motionless
looking
after
her
far
out
on
the
fjord
is
seen
a
boat
from
which
the
following
chorus
is
faintly
heard
chorus
my
wings
i
open
my
sails
spread
wide
and
cleave
like
an
eagle
life
glassy
tide
gulls
follow
my
furrow
foaming
overboard
with
the
ballast
of
care
and
cark
and
what
if
i
shatter
my
roaming
bark
it
is
passing
sweet
to
be
roaming
falk
starting
from
a
reverie
what
music
ah
it
will
be
lind
quartette
getting
their
jubilation
well
met
to
guldstad
who
enters
with
an
overcoat
on
his
arm
ah
slipping
off
sir
guldstad
yes
with
your
goodwill
but
let
me
first
put
on
my
overcoat
we
are
susceptible
to

during

has
been
walking
about
in
the
garden

into

and
looks
in

the

has
somewhat
abated
falk
there
love

being
done

clasping
their

together
what
tyranny

but
think
his
call
that
would
not
be
denied

must
be
submissive
to
the

reflecting
but
if
i
apprehended
him
aright
his
call
a
problematical
affair
the

altogether
in

falk
pray
do
not
judge
so
rashly
i
can
give
you
absolute
assurance
as
i

his
call
is
definite
and
incontestable
strawman
seeing
it
in
a
new
light
ah
if
there
something
fixed

i
nothing

most
of

i

the

strawman
with

unctuous

ah
yes
if
he
were
free
my
dear
young

willingly
agree
the
thing
might
pass
but
being
pledged
and
bound
he
scarcely

sound

vigorous

to
found
a
little

still
the

upon

the
offering
falk
that
no
trifle
i
aware
strawman
ah
come
that
wholly
alters
the
affair
when
men
are
zealous
in
their
offering
and
liberal
falk
there
he
far
surpasses
most
strawman
he
say
you
how
in
virtue
of
his
post
the
offering
is
not
what
he
has
to
bring
but
what
he
has
to
get
strawman

i
thought
the
tour
a
little
long
the
fourteen
days
might
well
be
better
spent
falk
nay
but
you
had
another
argument
for
staying

the
lovely
dale
for
you
was
mountain
air
and
winged
warble
too
lind
yes
to
be
sure
this
air
is
unalloyed
but
all
its
benefits
may
be
enjoyed
over

but
it
was
just
the
book

spare
the

we

miss

who

such
very
great

well
but
the

a
fever

almost
doubted

falk
ah

a
sort
of
witchery
you

lind
thank
god
i
woke
in
perfect
during
the

one
would
imagine

no
my
dear
lind
you
take
another
view
when
you
have
heard
the
whole

discussed
lind
but
then
this
warfare
for
the
faith
you
know
is
my
most
cherished
dream
miss

o
who
would
build
on
dreaming
in
this
century
of
light

a
dream
the
other
night
there
came
a
letter
singularly
sealed
strawman

a
dream

nodding
yes

next
day
they
sued
him
for
the
rates

make
a
circle
round
lind
and
go
in
conversation
with
him
into
the
garden

perceive
that
to
desert
your
call
were
absolutely
inexcusable
anna
half
crying
oh
i
so
young
strawman
and
it
is
natural
i
own
that
one
should
tremble
to
essay
these
perils
dare
the
lures
that
there
waylay
but
from
doubt
tangle
you
must
now
break

your
dear
mother
tells
me
that
i
too
was
just
as
inconsolable
as
you
when
we
received
our
call
strawman
and
for
like
cause
the
fascination
of
the

it
was
but
when
a
little
money
had
come

she
quite
got
over
it
falk
sotto

and
turning
again
to

falk

so
very
slender
after
all
did
you
not
falk
falk
nay
pastor
strawman
to
be
sure
to

of
something
then
at

so
look

him
falk
now
let
us
tackle
her
approaches
anna
strawman
with
a
deprecating
motion
she
needs
no
secular
solicitation
the
spirit
has
spoken
what
can
earth
bestead
modestly
if
in
some
small
degree
my
words
have

power
was
vouchsafed
me
halm
come
no
more
evasion
bring
them
together
aunts
with
emotion
ah
how
exquisite
strawman
yes
can
there
be
a
heart
so
dull
and
dead
as
not
to
be
entranced
at
such
a
sight
it
is
so
thrilling
and
so
penetrating
so
lacerating
so
exhilarating
to
see
an
innocent
babe
devoutly
lay
its
offering
on
duty
altar
halm
nay
her
family
have
also
done
their
part
miss
jay
i
and
the
aunts
i
should
imagine
so
you
lind
may
have
the
key
to
anna
heart
presses
his
hand
but
we
possess
a
picklock
you
must
know
able
to
open
where
the
key
avails
not
and
if
in
years
to
come
cares
throng
and
thwart
only
apply
to
us
our
friendship
fails
not
halm
yes
we
shall
hover
round
you
all
your
life
miss

and
shield
you
from
the
fiend
of
wedded
strife
strawman
enchanting
group
love
friendship
hour
of
gladness
yet
so
pathetically
touched
with
sadness
turning
to
lind
but
now
young
man
pray
make
an
end
of
this
leading
anna
to
him
take
thy
betrothed
receive
her
with
a
kiss
lind
giving
his
hand
to
anna
i
stay
at
home
anna
at
the
same
moment
i
go
with
you
anna
amazed
you
stay
lind
equally
so
you
go
with
me
anna
with
a
helpless
glance
at
the
company
why
then
we
are
divided
as
before
lind
what
this
the
ladies
what
now
miss
jay
excitedly
our
wills
are
at
war
strawman
she
gave
her
solemn
word
to
cross
the
sea
with
him
miss
jay
and
he
gave
his
to
stay
ashore
with
her
falk
laughing
they
both
complied
what
would
you
more
strawman
these
complications
are
too
much
for
me
goes
toward
the
background
aunts
to
one
another
how
in
the
world
came
they
to
disagree
halm
to
guldstad
and
stiver
who
have
been
walking
in
the
garden
and
now
approach
the
spirit
of
discord
in
possession
of
her
talks
aside
to
them
strawman
to
miss
jay
noticing
that
the
table
is
being
laid
there
comes
the
tea
miss
jay
curtly
thank
heaven
falk
hurrah
a
cheer
for
love
and
friendship
maiden
aunts
and
tea
stiver
but
if
the
case
stands
thus
the
whole
proceeding
may
easily
be
ended
with
a
laugh
all
turns
upon
a
single
paragraph
which
bids
the
wife
attend
the
spouse
no
pleading
can
wrest
an
ordinance
so
clearly
stated
miss
jay
doubtless
but
does
that
help
us
to
agree
strawman
she
must
obey
a
law
that
heaven
dictated
stiver
but
lind
can
circumvent
that
law
you
see
to
lind
put
off
your
journey
and
then
budge
no

it

miss

but
china
is
an

you
hold
in

that

is
very
old

antecedent
to
jerusalem
falk
yes
was
already
famous
when
methusalem
his

rattles
tore

flung
miss

triumphantly
and
love
is
in
its
very
nature
young
to
find
a
likeness
there
is
pretty
bold
falk
no
love
in
truth
is
also
very
old
that
principle
we
here
no
more
dispute
than
do
the

of

there
are
those
from
cayenne

who
stand
upon

everlastingness
well
that
may
be
slight
exaggeration
but
old
it
is
beyond
all
estimation
miss

love
is
all
alike
whereas
we
see
both
good

bad

middling
kinds
of

where

as

that

if
it

over

it

it

a

the

it

what
then

yet
you
want

thrust

out
falk
madam
you
quite
mistake
in
all
i
spoke
i
cast
no
doubt
on
anything
you
claim
but
i
would
fain
remind
you
that
from
smoke
we
can
not
logically
argue
flame
that
men
are
married
and
have
children
i
have
no
desire
whatever
to
deny
nor
do
i
dream
of
doubting
that
such
things
are
in
the
world
as
troth
and
the
some
tender
hands
indite
and
seal
with
pairs
of
turtle
doves
that
fight
that
sweethearts
swarm
in
cottage
and
in

that
chocolate
reward
the
wedding
call
that
usage
and
convention
have
decreed
in
every
point
how
lovers
shall
proceed
but
heavens
we
majors
also
by
the
score
arsenals
heaped
with
muniments
of
war
with
spurs
and
howitzers
and
drums
and
shot
but
what
does
that
permit
us
to
infer
that
we
have
men
who
dangle
swords
but
not
that
they
will
wield
the
weapons
that
they
wear
tho
all
the
plain
with
gleaming
tents
you
crowd
does
that
make
heroes
of
the
men
they
shroud
strawman
well
all
in
moderation
i
must
own
it
is
not
quite
conducive
to
the
truth
that
we
should
paint
the
enamourment
of
youth
so
bright
as
if
ahem
it
stood
alone
still
a
frail
foundation
is
only
the
snuggery
of
wedded
bliss
provides
a
rock
where
love
may
builded
be
in
unassailable
security
miss

there
i
entirely
differ
in
my
view
a
free
accord
of
lovers
heart
with
heart
who
hold
together
having
leave
to
part
gives
the
best
warrant
that
their

the
hip
miss
jay
offended
you
jeer
falk
a
useful
household
condiment
heaven
knows
but
yet
the
hip
was
not
his
bridal
rose
halm
o
if
it
is
a
queen
he
wants
i
very
sorry
these
are
not
their
haunts
falk
o
yes
i
know
the
pretty
coquetry
they
carry
on
with
domesticity
it
is
a
suckling
of
the
mighty
lie
that
like
spreads
itself
on
high
i
madam
reverently
bare
my
head
to
the
ball
queen
a
child
of
beauty
she
and
the
ideal
golden
woof
is
spread
in
hardly
in
the
nursery
halm
with
suppressed
bitterness
your
conduct
sir
is
easily
explained
a
plighted
lover
can
not
be
a
friend
that
is
the
kernel
of
the
whole
affair
i
have
a
very
large
experience
there
falk
no
doubt
with
seven
nieces
each
a
wife
halm
and
each
a
happy
wife
falk
with
emphasis
ah
do
we
know
guldstad
how
miss
jay
falk
lind
are
you
resolved
to
sow
dissension
falk
vehemently
yes
war
discord
turmoil
strife
stiver
what
you
a
lay
profane
outsider
here
falk
no
matter
still
the
i
rear
yes
it
is
war
i
mean
with
nail
and
tooth
against
the
lie
with
the
tenacious
root
the
lie
that
you
have
fostered
into
fruit
for
all
its
strutting
in
the
guise
of
truth
stiver
against
these
groundless
charges
i
protest
reserving
right
of
action
miss
jay
do
be
still
falk
so
then
it
is
love
rill
that
tells
the
widow
what
she
once
possess
out
of
her
language
blotted
moan
and
sigh
so
then
it
is
love
brimming
tide
that
rolls
along
the
placid
veins
of
wedded
souls
that
very
love
that
faced
the
iron
sleet
trampling
inane
convention
under
feet
and
scoffing
at
the
impotent
discreet
so
then
it
is
love
flame
that
keeps
the
plighted
from
the
taint
of
time
year
after
year
ah
yes
the
very
same
that
made
our
young
bureaucrat
blaze
in
rhyme
so
it
is
love
young
bliss
that
will
not
brave
the
voyage
over
vaulted
ocean
wave
but
asks
a
sacrifice
when
like
the
sun
its
face
should
fill
with
glory
making
one
ah
no
you
vulgar
prophets
of
the
lie
give
things
the
names
we
ought
to
know
them
by
call
widows
passion
wanting
what
they
miss
and
wedlock
habit
call
it
what
it
is
strawman
young
man
this
insolence
has
gone
too
far
in
every
word
there
scoffing
and
defiance
goes
close
up
to
falk
now
i
gird
up
my
aged
loins
to
war
for
hallowed
custom
against
modern
science
falk
i
go
to
battle
as
it
were
a
feast
strawman
good
for
your
bullets
i
will
be
a
beacon
nearer
a
wedded
pair
is
holy
like
a
priest
stiver
at
falk
other
side
and
a
betrothed
falk
like
the
deacon
strawman
behold
these
children
see
this
little
throng
may
for
them
be
sung
how
was
it
possible
how
practicable
the
words
of
truth
are
strong
inexorable
he
has
no
hearing
whom
they
can
not
move
see
every
one
of
them
a
child
of
love
stops
in
confusion
that
is
you
understand
i
would
have
said
miss
jay
fanning
herself
with
her
handkerchief
this
is
a
very
mystical
oration
falk
there
you
yourself
provide
the
demonstration
a
good
old
norse
one
sound
you
draw
distinction
between
wedded
pledges
and
those
of
love
your
logic
without
flaw
they
are
distinguished
just
as
roast
from
raw
as
hothouse
bloom
from
wilding
of
the
hedges
love
is
with
us
a
science
and
an
art
it
long
ago
since
ceased
to
animate
the
heart
love
is
with
us
a
trade
a
special
line
of
business
with
its
union
code
and
sign
it
is
a
guild
of
married
folks
and
plighted
with
apprentices
united
for
they
cohere
compact
as
a
their
single
want
and
wish
is
guldstad
and
a
gazette
falk
a
good
suggestion
yes
we
too
must
have
our
organ
in
the

like
ladies
athletes
boys
and
devotees
do
ask
the

at

if
you

we
are
often

men
can
not

on

i
show
that
this
is
an

hypothesis
for

will
prove
to
be
a

particularly
if

fired
me
to
a
nobler
task
right
in
the
midst
of
men
the
church
is
founded
where
truth
appealing
clarion
must
be
sounded
we
are
not
called
like
demigods
to
gaze
on
the
battle
from
the
mountain
crest
but
in
our
hearts
to
bear
our
fiery
blazon
an
olaf
cross
upon
a
mailed
breast
to
look
afar
across
the
fields
of
flight
tho
pent
within
the
mazes
of
its
might
beyond
the
mirk
descry
one
glimmer
still
of
glory
that
the
call
we
must
fulfil
svanhild
and
you
fulfil
it
when
you
break
from
men
stand
free
alone
falk
did
i
frequent
them
then
and
there
lies
duty
no
that
time
gone
by
my
solitary
compact
with

my
poetry
is
done
my
verse
shall
live
in
forest
and
in
field
i
fight
under
the
splendour
of
the
sun
i
or
the
lie
one
of
us
two

yield
svanhild

a

shafts
of
hate

you
dare
with
me
to
stand
or
fall
henceforth
along
the
beaten
walks
i
move
heedful
of
each
constraining
etiquette
spread
like
the
rest
of
men
my
board
and
set
the
ring
upon
the
finger
of
love
takes
a
ring
from
his
finger
and
holds
it
up
svanhild
in
breathless
suspense
you
mean
that
falk
yes
by
us
the
world
will
see
love
has
an
everlasting
energy
that
suffers
not
its
splendour
to
take
hurt
from
the
day
dust
the
common
highway
dirt
last
night
i
showed
you
the
ideal
aflame
beaconing
from
a
dizzy
mountain
brow
you
shuddered
for
you
were
a
woman
now
i
show
you

a
soul
like
yours
what
it
has
vowed
will
keep
you

the
abyss
before
you
svanhild
leap
svanhild
almost
inaudibly
if
we
should
fail
falk
exulting
no
in
your
eyes
i
see
a
gleam
that
surely
prophesies
our
winning
svanhild
then
take
me
as
i
am
take
all
of
me

porter
nay
such
payment

a
poor

but
sir

thinking
if

have
done
with
all
your
learning

and
rather

more
nay

the
porter
goes
out
to
the
left
falk
approaching
svanhild
who
comes
to
meet
him
one
moment
ours
my
svanhild
in
the
light
of
god
and
of
the
lustrous
summer
night
how
the
stars
glitter
thro
the
leafage
see
like
bright
fruit
hanging
on
the
great
now
slavery
last
manacle
i
slip
now
for
the
last
time
feel
the
wealing
whip
like
israel
at
the
passover
i
stand
loins
girded
for
the
desert
staff
in
hand
dull
generation
from
whose
sight
is
hid
the
promised
land
beyond
that
desert
flight
thrall
tricked
with
knighthood
never
the
more
knight
tomb
thyself
kinglike
in
the
pyramid
i
cross
the
barren
desert
to
be
free
my
ship
strides
on
despite
an
ebbing
sea
but
there
the
legion
lie
shall
find
its
doom
and
glut
one
deep
dark
tomb
a
short
pause
he
looks
at
her
and
takes
her
hand
you
are
so
still
svanhild
so
happy
suffer
me
o
suffer
me
in
silence
still
to
dream
speak
you
for
me
my
budding
thoughts
grown
strong
one
after
one
will
burgeon
into
song
like
lilies
in
the
bosom
of
the
stream
falk
o
say
it
once
again
in
truth
pure
tone
beyond
the
fear
of
doubt
that
thou
art
mine
o
say
it
svanhild
say
svanhild
throwing
herself
on
his
neck
yes
i
am
thine
falk
thou
god
sent
me
for
my
own
svanhild
homeless
within
my
mother
house
i
dwelt
lonely
in
all
i
thought
in
all
i
felt
a
guest
unbidden
at
the
feast
of
mirth
accounted
nothing
less
than
nothing
worth
then
you
appeared
for
the
first
time
i
heard
my
own
thought
uttered
in
another
word
to
my
lame
visions
you
gave
wings
and
feet
you
young
unmasker
of
the
obsolete
half
with
your
caustic
keenness
you
alarmed
me
half
with
your
radiant
eloquence
you
charmed
me
as
forests
summon
with
their
spell
the
sea
their
flinty
beaches
still
repel
now
i
have
read
the
bottom
of
your
soul
now
you
have
won
me
undivided
whole
dear
forest
where
my
tossing
billows
beat
my
tide
at
flood
and
never
will
retreat
falk
and
i
thank
god
that
in
the
bath
of
pain
he
purged
my
love
what
strong
compulsion
drew
me
on
i
knew
not
till
i
saw
in
you
the
treasure
i
had
blindly
sought
in
vain
i
praise
him
who
our
love
has
lifted
thus
to
noble
rank
by
sorrow
licensed
us
to
a
triumphal
progress
bade
us
sweep
thro
fen
and
forest
to
our
a
noble
pair
astride
on
pegasus
svanhild
pointing
to
the
house

whole
house

making
feast
there
in
their
honour

room

there
cheerful
talk
and
joyous
song

out
on
the
highroad
no
will
doubt
that
men
are
happy
where
they
are
so
gay
with
compassion
poor
sister
happy
in
the
great
world
way
falk
poor
sister
say
you
svanhild
has
she
not
divided
with
kith
and
kin
the
treasure
of
her
soul
her
capital
to
fifty
hands
confided
so
that
not
one
is
debtor
for
the
whole
from
no
one
has
she
all
things
to
receive
for
no
one
has
she
utterly
to
live
o
beside
my
wealth
hers
is
little
worth
i
have
but
one
possession
upon
earth
my
heart
was
lordless
when
with
trumpet
blare
and
multitudinous
song
you
came
its
king
the
banners
of
my
thought
your
ensign
bear
you
fill
my
soul
with
glory
like
the
spring
yes
i
must
needs
thank
god
when
it
is
past
that
i
was
lonely
till
i
found
out
thee
that
i
lay
dead
until
the
trumpet
blast
waken
me
from
the
world
frivolity
falk
yes
we
who
have
no
friends
on
earth
we
twain
own
the
true
wealth
the
golden
fortune
we
who
stand
without
beside
the
starlit
sea
and
watch
the
indoor
revel
thro
the
pane
let
the
lamp
glitter
and
the
song
resound
let
the
dance
madly
eddy
round
and
round
look
up
my
svanhild
into
yon
deep
blue
there
glitter
little
lamps
in
thousands
too
svanhild
and
hark
beloved
thro
the
limes
there
floats
this
balmy
eve
a
chorus
of
sweet
notes
falk
it
is
for
us
that
fretted
vault
aglow
svanhild
it
is
for
us
the
vale
is
loud
below
falk
i
feel
myself
like
god
lost
prodigal
i
left
him
for
the
world
delusive
charms
with
mild
reproof
he
wooed
me
to
his
arms
and
when
i
come
he
lights
the
vaulted
hall
prepares
a
banquet
for
the
son
restored
and
makes
his
noblest
creature
my
reward
from
this
time
forth
i
never
leave
that
light
but
stand
its
armed
defender
in
the
fight
nothing
shall
part
us
and
our
life
shall
prove
a
song
of
glory
to
triumphant
love
svanhild
and
see
how
easy
triumph
is
for
two
when
he
a
man
falk
she
woman
thro
and
thro
it
is
impossible
for
such
to
fall
svanhild
then
up
and
to
the
war
with
want
and
sorrow
this
very
hour
i
will
declare
it
all
pointing
to
falk
ring
on
her
finger
falk
hastily
no
svanhild
not
wait
till
we
gather
our
young
love
red
rose
sacrilege
to
smirch
it
with
the
prose
of
common
day
the
door
into
the
opens
your
mother
coming
hide
no
eye
this
night
shall
see
thee
as
my
bride
they
go
out
among
the
trees
by
the
halm
and
guldstad
come
out
on
the
balcony

seems
so
i
admit
stiver
coming

aware
of
it

a
most
unfortunate
punctilio
he

in
the
gazette
he
put
us
all
by

my
love
will
figure
under
leaded
headings
with
jilts
and
twins
and
countermanded
weddings
listen
i
tell
you
if
it
were
for
shame
i
would
propose
an
armistice
a
truce
halm
you
think
he
would
be
willing
stiver
i
deduce
the
fact
from
certain
signs
which
indicate
that
his
tall
talk
about
his
amor
news
was
uttered
in
a
far
from
sober
state
one
proof
especially
if
not
transcendent
yet
tells
most
heavily
against
defendant
it
has
been
clearly
proved
that
after
dinner
to
his
and
lind
joint
chamber
he
withdrew
and
there
displayed
such
singular
demeanour
as
leaves
no
question
guldstad
sees
a
glimpse
of
falk
and
svanhild
who
separate
falk
going
to
the
background
svanhild
remains
standing
hidden
by
the
hold
we
have
the
clue
madam
one
word
falk
does
not
mean
to
go
or
if
he
does
he
means
it
as
a
friend
stiver
how
you
believe
then
halm
what
do
you
intend
guldstad
with
the
least
possible
delay
i
show
that
matters
move
precisely
as
you
would
merely
a
word
in
private
halm
very
good
they
go
together
into
the
garden
and
are
seen
from

in
lively
conversation
stiver
descending
into
the
garden
discovers
falk
who

standing
by

less
intractable
than
when
we
parted
falk

my
own
inexorable
way
strawman
even
tho
you
crush
another
happiness
falk
i
plant
the
flower
of
knowledge
in
its
place
smiling
if
by
the
way
you
have
not
ceased
to
think
of
the
gazette
strawman
ah
that
was
all
a
joke
falk
yes
pluck
up
courage
that
will
turn
to
smoke
i
break
the
ice
in
action
not
in

strawman
but
even
though
you
spare
me
sure
enough
there
one
who
wo
so
lightly
let
me
off
he
has
the
advantage
and
he
wo
forego

the
ashes
of
our
faded
flames
and
you
may
take
your
oath
he
wo
be
still
if
once
i
mutter
but
a
syllable
against
the
brazen
bluster
of
his
claims
these
gentlemen
they
say
are
very
potent
in
the
press
a
trumpery
paragraph
can
lay
me
low
once
printed
in
that
gazette
that
with
the
jaw
of
asses
fells
its
foe
and
runs
away
with
tackle
and
with
net
especially
towards
the
quarter
day
falk
aquiescing
ah
were
there
scandal
in
the
case
indeed
strawman
despondently
no
matter
read
its
columns
with
good
heed
you
see
me
offered
up
to
vengeance
falk
whimsically
nay
to
retribution
punishment
thro
all
our
life
there
runs
a
nemesis
which
may
delay
but
never
will
relent
and
grants
to
none
exception
or
release
who
wrongs
the
ideal
straight
there
rushes
in
the
press
its
guardian
with
the
argus
eye
and
the
offender
suffers
for
his
sin
strawman
but
in
the
name
of
heaven
what
pledge
have
i
given
this
ideal
that
ever
on
your
tongue
i
married
have
a
family
twelve
young
and
helpless
innocents
to
clothe
and
keep
i
have
my
daily
calls
on
every
side
churches
remote
and
gleve
and
pasture
wide
great
herds
of
breeding
cattle
ghostly
sheep
all
to
be
watched
and
cared
for
clipt
and
fed
grain
to
be
winnowed
compost
to
be
spread
wanted
all
day
in
shippon
and
in
stall
what
time
have
to
serve
the
ideal
withal
falk
then
get
you
home
with
what
dispatch
you
may
creep
snugly
in
before
the
look
in
young
norway
dawns
at
last
the
day
thousand
brave
hearts
are
in
its
ranks
enroll
its
banners
in
the
morning
breezes
play
strawman
and
if
young
man
i
were
to
take
my
way
with
bag
and
baggage
home
with
everything
that
made
me
yesterday
a
little
king
were
mine
the
only
think
you
i
carry
back
the
wealth
i
brought
as
falk
is
about
to
answer
nay
listen
let
me
first
explain
my
thought
coming
nearer
time
was
when
i
was
young
like
you
and
played
like
you
the
unconquerable
titan
part
year
after
year
i
toiled
and
moiled
for
bread
which
hardens
a
man
hand
but
not
his
heart
for
northern
fells
my
lonely
home
surrounded
and
by
my
parish
bounds
my
world
was
bounded
my
home
ah
falk
i
wonder
do
you
know
what
home
is
falk
curtly
i
have
never
known
strawman
just
so
that
is
a
home
where
five
may
dwell
with
ease
tho
two
would
be
a
crowd
if
enemies
that
is
a
home
where
all
your
thoughts
play
free
as
boys
and
girls
about
their
father
knee
where
speech
no
sooner
touches
heart
than
tongue
darts
back
an
answering
harmony
of
song
where
you
may
grow
from
and
not
a
soul
take
note
that
you
grow
old
where
memories
grow
fairer
as
they
fade
like
far
blue
peaks
beyond
the
forest
glade
falk
with
constrained
sarcasm
come
you
grow
warm
strawman
where
you
but
jeered
and
flouted
so
utterly
unlike
god
made
us
two
i
bare
of
that
he
lavished
upon
you
but
i
have
won
the
game
where
you
were
routed
seen
from
the
clouds
full
many
a
wayside
grain
of
truth
seems
empty
chaff
and
husks
you
soar
to
heaven
i
scarcely
reach
the
stable
door
one
bird
an
eagle
born
falk
and
one
a
hen
strawman
yes
laugh
away
and
say
it
be
so
grant
i
am
a
hen
there
clusters
to
my
cluck
a
crowd
of
little
chickens
which
you
want
and
i
the
hen
high
spirit
and
her
pluck
and
for
my
little
ones
forget
myself
you
think
me
dull
i
know
it
possibly
you
pass
a
harsher
judgment
yet
decree
me
over
covetous
of
worldly
pelf
good
on
that
head
we
will
not
disagree
seizes
falk
arm
and
continues
in
a
low
tone
but
with
gathering
vehemence
you
right
i
dull
and
dense
and
grasping
yes
but
grasping
for
my
babes
and
wife
and
dense
from
struggling
blindly
for
bare
life
and
dull
from
sailing
seas
of
loneliness
just
when
the
pinnance
of
my
youthful
dream
into
the
everlasting
deep
went
down
another
started
from
the
ocean
stream
borne
with
a
fair
wind
onward
to
life
crown
for
every
dream
that
vanished
in
the
wave
for
every
buoyant
plume
that
broke
asunder
god
sent
me
in
return
a
little
wonder
and
gratefully
i
took
the
good
he
gave
for
them
i
strove
for
them
amassed
annexed
for
them
for
them
explained
the
holy
text
on
them
you
poured
the
venom
of
your
spite
you
proved
with
all
the
cunning
of
the
schools
my
bliss
was
but
the
paradise
of
fools
that
all
i
took
for
earnest
was
a
jest
now
i
implore
give
me
my
quiet
breast
again
the
flawless
peace
of
mind
i
had
falk
prove
in
a
word
your
title
to
be
glad
strawman
yes
in
my
path
you
cast
the
stone
of
doubt
and
nobody
but
you
can
cast
it
out
between
my
kin
and
me
you
set
a
bar
remove
the
bar
the
strangling
noose
undo
falk
you
possibly
believe
i
keep
the
glue
of
lies
for
happiness
in
a
broken
jar
strawman
i
do
believe
the
faith
your
reasons
tore
to
shreds
your
reasons
may
again
restore
the
limb
that
you
have
shatter
you
can
set
reverse
your
judgment
the
whole
truth
unfold
restate
the
case
i
fly
my
banner
yet
falk
haughtily
i
stamp
no
copper
happiness
as
gold
strawman
looking
fixedly
at
him
remember
then
that
lately
one
whose
scent
for
truth
is
of
the
keenest
told
us
this
with
uplifted
finger
there
runs
through
all
our
life
a
nemesis
which
may
delay
but
never
will
relent
he
goes
towards
the
house
stiver
coming
out
with
glasses
on
and
an
open
book
in
his
hand
pastor
you
must
come
flying
like
the
blast
your
girls
are
sobbing
the
children
in
the
doorway
pa
stiver
and
madam
waiting
strawman
goes
in
this
lady
has
no
talent
for
debating
puts
the
book
and
glasses
in
his
pocket
and
approaches
falk
falk
falk
yes
stiver
i
hope
you
changed
your
mind
at
last
falk
why
so
stiver
for
obvious
reasons
to
betray
communications
made
in
confidence
is
conduct
utterly
without
defence
they
must
not
pass
the
lips
falk
no
i
heard
say
it
is
at
times
a
risky
game
to
play
stiver
the
very
devil
falk
only
for
the
great
stiver
zealously
no
no
for
all
us
servants
of
the
state
only
imagine
how
my
future
chances
would
dwindle
if
the
governor
once
knew
i
keep
pegasus
that
neighs
and
prances
in
office
hours
and
such
an
office
too
from
first
to
last
you
know
in
our
profession
the
winged
horse
is
viewed
with
reprobation
but
worst
of
all
would
be
if
it
got
wind
that
i
against
our
primal
law
had
by
bringing
secret
matters
to
the
light
falk
that
penal
is
it
such
an
oversight
stiver
mysteriously
it
can
a
servant
of
the
state
compel
to
beg
for
his
dismissal
out
of
hand
on
us
officials
lies
a
strict
command
even
by
the
hearth
to
be
inscrutable
falk
o
those
despotical
authorities
muzzling
the
clerk
that
treadeth
out
the
grain
stiver
shrugging
his
shoulders
it
is
the
law
to
murmur
is
in
vain
moreover
at
a
moment
such
as
this
when
salary
revision
is
in
train
it
is
not
well
to
advertise
one
views
of
office
time
true
function
and
right
use
that
why
i
beg
you
to
be
silent
look
a
word
may
forfeit
my
falk
portfolio
stiver
officially
it
called
a
transcript
book
a
protocol
the
clasp
upon
the
veil
of
snow
that
shrouds
the
modest
breast
of
the
bureau
what
lies
beneath
you
must
not
seek
to
know
falk
and
yet
i
only
spoke
at
your
desire
you
hinted
at
your
literary
crop
stiver
how
should
i
guess
he
grovel
in
the
mire
so
deep
this
parson
perch
on
fortune
top
a
man
with
snug
appointments
children
wife
and
money
to
defy
the
ills
of
life
if
such
a
man
prove
such
a
philistine
what
shall
of
us
poor
copyists
be
said
of
me
who
drive
the
quill
and
rule
the
line
a
man
engaged
and
shortly
to
be
wed
with
family
in
prospect
and
so
forth
more
vehemently
o
if
i
only
had
a
berth
i
bind
the
armour
helmet
on
my
head
and
cry
defiance
to
united
earth
and
were
i
only
unengaged
like
you
trust
me
i
break
a
road
athwart
the
snow
of
prose
and
carry
the
ideal
through
falk
to
work
then
man
stiver
how
falk
you
may
still
do
so
let
the
world
prudish
owl
unheeded
flutter
by
freedom
converts
the
grub
into
a
butterfly
stiver
you
mean
to
break
the
engagement
falk
that
my
mind
the
fruit
is
gone
why
keep
the
empty
rind
stiver
such
a
proposal
for
a
green
young
shoot
not
for
a
man
of
judgment
and
repute
i
heed
not
what
king
christian
in
his
time
the
fifth
laid
down
about
engagements
for
that
relationship
is
nowhere
spoken
of
in
any
rubric
of
the
code
of
crime
the
act
would
not
be
criminal
in

it
would
in
no
way
violate
the
laws
falk
why
there
you
see
then
stiver
firmly
yes
but
all
the

i
must
reject
all
pleas
in

a

gloaming
stiver
stands
listening
in
silent
emotion
with
the
same
melody
she
calls
me
yet
which
thrilled
me
to
the
heart
when
first
we
met
lays
his
hand
on
falk
arm
and
gazes
intently
at
him
oft
as
she
wakens
those
pathetic
notes
from
the
white
keys
reverberating
floats
an
echo
of
the
yes
that
made
her
mine
and
when
our
passions
shall
one
day
decline
to
live
again
as
friendship
to
the
last
that
song
shall
link
that
present
to
this
past
and
what
tho
at
the
desk
my
back
grow
round
and
my
day
work
a
battle
for
mere
bread
yet
joy
will
lead
me
homeward
where
the
dead
enchantment
will
be
born
again
in
sound
if
one
poor
bit
of
evening
we
can
claim
i
shall
come
off
undamaged
from
the

towards
the
svanhild
comes
out
she
is
pale
and
agitated
they
gaze
at
each
other
in
silence
a
moment
and
fling
themselves
impetuously
into
each
other
arms
falk
o
svanhild
let
us
battle
side
by
side
thou
fresh
glad
blossom
flowering
by
the
tomb
see
what
the
life
is
that
they
call
youth
bloom
there
wherever
two
go
by
at
the
street
corner
smiling
outwardly
with
falsehood
reeking
sepulchre
beneath
and
in
their
blood
the
apathy
of
death
and
this
they
think
is
living
heaven
and
earth
is
such
a
load
so
many
antics
worth
for
such
an
end
to
haul
up
babes
in
shoals
to
pamper
them
with
honesty
and
reason
to
feed
them
fat
with
faith
one
sorry
season
for
service
after
as
souls
svanhild
falk
let
us
travel
falk
travel
whither
then
is
not
the
whole
world
everywhere
the
same
and
does
not
truth
own
mirror
in
its
frame
lie
equally
to
all
the
sons
of
men
no
we
will
stay
and
watch
the
merry
game
the
conjurer
trick
the
of
liars
that
are
dupes
of
their
own
lie
stiver
and
lind
the
parson
and
his
dame
see
them
prize
oxen
harness
to
love
yoke
and
yet
at
bottom
very
decent
folk
each
wears
for
others
and
himself
a
mask
yet
one
too
innocent
to
take
to
task
each
one
a
stranded
sailor
on
a
wreck
counts
himself
happy
as
the
gods
in
heaven
each
his
own
hand
from
paradise
has
driven
then
splash
into
the
sulphur
to
the
neck
but
none
has
any
inkling
where
he
lies
each
thinks
himself
a
knight
of
paradise
and
each
sits
smiling
between
howl
and
howl
and
if
the
fiend
come
by
with
jeer
and
growl
with
horns
and
hoofs
and
things
yet
more
abhorred
then
each
man
jogs
the
neighbour
at
his
jowl
off
with
your
hat
man
see
there
goes
the
lord
svanhild
after
a
brief
thoughtful
silence
how
marvellous
a
love
my
steps
has
led
to
this
sweet
trysting
place
my
life
that
sped
in
frolic
and
fantastic
visions
gay
henceforth
shall
grow
one
ceaseless
working
day
o
god
i
wandered
groping
all
was
dim
thou
gavest
me
light
and
i
discovered
him
gazing
at
falk
in
love
and
wonder
whence
is
that
strength
of
thine
thou
mighty
tree
that
alone
and
yet
canst
shelter
me
falk
god
truth
my
svanhild
that
gives
fortitude
svanhild
with
a
shy
glance
towards
the
house
they
came
like
tempters
evilly
inclined
each
spokesman
for
his
half
of
humankind
one
asking
how
can
true
love
reach
its
goal
when
riches
leaden
weight
subdues
the
soul
the
other
asking
how
can
true
love
speed
when
life
a
battle
to
the
death
with
need
o
horrible
to
bid
the
world
receive
that
teaching
as
the
truth
and
yet
to
live
falk
how
if
meant
for
us
svanhild
for
us
what
then
can
outward
fate
control
the
wills
of
men
i
have
already
said
if
stand
fast
i
dare
and
suffer
by
thee
to
the
last
how
light
to
listen
to
the
gospel
voice
to
leave
one
home
behind
to
weep
rejoice
and
take
with
god
the
husband
of
one
choice
falk
embracing
her
come
then
and
blow
thy
worst
thou
winter
weather
we
stand
unshaken
for
we
stand
together
halm
and
guldstad
come
in
from
the
right
in
the
background
guldstad
aside
observe
falk
and
svanhild
remain
standing
by
the
halm
surprised
together
guldstad
do
you
doubt
it
now
halm
this
is
most
singular
guldstad
o
i
noted
how
his
work
of
late
absorb
his
interest
halm
to
herself
who
would
have
fancied
svanhild
so
sly
vivaciously
to
guldstad
but
no
i
ca
think
guldstad
put
it
to
the
test
halm
now
on
the
spot
guldstad
yes
and
decisively
halm
giving
him
her
hand
god
blessing
with
you
guldstad
gravely
thanks
it
may
bestead
comes
to
the
front
halm
looking
back
as
she
goes
towards
the
house
whichever
way
it
goes
my
child
is
sped
goes
in
guldstad
approaching
falk
it
late
i
think
falk
ten
minutes
and
i
go
guldstad
sufficient
for
my
purpose
svanhild
going
farewell
guldstad
no
remain
svanhild
shall
i
guldstad
until
you
answered
me
it
time
we
squared
accounts
it
time
we
three
talked
out
for
once
together
from
the
heart
falk
taken
aback
we
three
guldstad
yes
all
disguises
flung
apart
falk
suppressing
a
smile
o
at
your
service
guldstad
very
good
then
hear
we
been
acquainted
now
for
half
a
year
we
wrangled
falk
yes
guldstad
we
been
in
constant
feud
we
changed
hard
blows
enough
you
fought
alone
for
a
sublime
ideal
i
as
one
among
the
multitude
and
yet
it
seemed
as
if
a
chord
united
us
two
as
if
a
thousand
thoughts
that
lay
deep
in
my
own
youth
memory
benighted
had
started
at
your
bidding
into
day
yes
i
amaze
you
but
this
hair
once
fluttered
brown
in
and
this
brow
which
daily
occupation
moistens
now
with
sweat
of
labour
was
not
always
wrinkled
enough
i
am
a
man
of
business
hence
falk
with
gentle
sarcasm
you
are
the
type
of
practical
good
sense
guldstad
and
you
are
hope
own
singer
young
and
fain
stepping
between
them
just
therefore
falk
and
svanhild
i
am
here
now
let
us
talk
then
for
the
hour
is
near
which
brings
good
hap
or
sorrow
in
its
train
falk
in
suspense
speak
then
guldstad
smiling
my
ground
is
as
i
said
last
night
a
kind
of
poetry
falk
in
practice
guldstad
right
falk
and
if
one
asked
the
source
from
which
you
drew
guldstad
glancing
a
moment
at
svanhild
and
then
turning
again
to
falk
a
common
source
discovered
by
us
two
svanhild
now
i
must
go
guldstad
no
wait
till
i
conclude
i
should
not
ask
so
much
of
others
you
svanhild
i
learnt
to
fathom
thro
and
thro
you
are
too
sensible
to
play
the
prude
i
watched
expand
unfold
your
little
life
a
perfect
woman
i
divined
within
you
but
long
i
only
saw
a
daughter
in
you
now
i
ask
of
you
will
you
be
my
wife
svanhild
draws
back
in
embarrassment
falk
seizing
his
arm
hold
guldstad
patience
she
must
answer
put
your
own
question
then
her
decision
will
be
free
falk
i
do
you
say
guldstad
looking
steadily
at
him
the
happiness
of
three
lives
is
at
stake
not
mine
alone
do
fancy
it
concerns
you
less
than
me
for
tho
base
matter
is
my
chosen
sphere
yet
nature
made
me
something
of
a
seer
yes
falk
you
love
her
gladly
i
confess
i
saw
your
young
love
bursting
into
flower
but
this
young
passion
with
its
lawless
power
may
be
the
ruin
of
her
happiness
falk
firing
up
you
have
the
face
to
say
so
guldstad
quietly
years
give
right
say
now
you
won
her
falk
defiantly
and
what
then
guldstad
slowly
and
emphatically
yes
say
she
ventured
in
one
bottom
to
embark
her
all
her
all
upon
one
card
to
play
and
then
life
tempest
swept
the
ship
away
and
the
flower
faded
as
the
day
grew
dark
falk
involuntarily
she
must
not
guldstad
looking
at
him
with
meaning
hm
so
i
myself
decided
when
i
was
young
like
you
in
days
of
old
i
was
afire
for
one
our
paths
divided
last
night
we
met
again
the
fire
was
cold
falk
last
night
guldstad
last
night
you
know
the
parson
dame
falk
what
it
was
she
then
who
guldstad
who
lit
the
flame
long
i
remembered
her
with
keen
regret
and
still
in
my
remembrance
she
arose
as
the
young
lovely
woman
that
she
was
when
in
life
buoyant
first
we
met
and
that
same
foolish
fire
you
now
are
fain
to
light
that
game
of
hazard
you
would
dare
see
that
is
why
i
call
to
you
beware
the
game
is
perilous
pause
and
think
again
falk
no
to
the
whole
i
declared
my
fixed
and
unassailable
belief
guldstad
completing
his
sentence
that
heartfelt
love
can
weather
unimpaired
custom
and
poverty
and
age
and
grief
well
say
it
be
so
possibly
you
right
but
see
the
matter
in
another
light
what
love
is
no
man
ever
told
us
whence
it
issues
that
ecstatic
confidence
that
one
life
may
fulfil
itself
in
two
to
this
no
mortal
ever
found
the
clue
but
marriage
is
a
practical
concern
as
also
is
betrothal
my
good
sir
and
by
experience
easily
we
learn
that
we
are
fitted
just
for
her
or
her
but
love
you
know
goes
blindly
to
its
fate
chooses
a
woman
not
a
wife
for
mate
and
what
if
now
this
chosen
woman
was
no
wife
for
you
falk
in
suspense
well
guldstad
shrugging
his
shoulders
then
you
lost
your
cause
to
make
happy
bridegroom
and
a
bride
demands
not
love
alone
but
much
beside
relations
that
do
not
wholly
disagree
and
marriage
why
it
is
a
very
sea
of
claims
and
calls
of
taxing
and
exaction
whose
bearing
upon
love
is
very
small
here
mild
domestic
virtues
are
demanded
a
kitchen
soul
inventive
and
neat
handed
making
no
claims
and
executing
all
and
much
which
in
a
lady
presence
i
can
hardly
with
decorum
specify
falk
and
therefore
guldstad
hear
a
golden
counsel
then
use
your
experience
watch
your
how
every
loving
couple
struts
and
swaggers
like
millionaires
among
a
world
of
beggars
they
scamper
to
the
altar
lad
and
lass
they
make
a
home
and
drunk
with
exultation
dwell
for
awhile
within
its
walls
of
glass
then
comes
the
day
of
reckoning
out
alas
they
bankrupt
and
their
house
in
liquidation
bankrupt
the
bloom
of
youth
on
woman
brow
bankrupt
the
flower
of
passion
in
her
breast
bankrupt
the
husband
now
bankrupt
each
spark
of
passion
he
possessed
bankrupt
the
whole
estate
below
above
and
yet
this
broken
pair
were
once
confessed
a
house
in
all
the
wares
of
love
falk
vehemently
that
is
a
lie
guldstad
unmoved
some
hours
ago
was
true
however
i
have
only
quoted
you
in
these
same
words
you
challenged
to
the
field
the
caucus
with
love
name
upon
your
shield
then
rang
repudiation
fast
and
thick
from
all
directions
as
from
you
at
present
incredible
i
know
who
finds
it
pleasant
to
hear
the
name
of
death
when
he
is
sick
look
at
the
priest
a
painter
and
composer
of
taste
and
spirit
when
he
wooed
his
bride
what
wonder
if
the
man
became
a
proser
when
she
was
snugly
settled
by
his
side
to
be
his
she
was
most
fit
to
be
his
wife
tho
not
a
bit
of
it
and
then
the
clerk
who
once
wrote
clever
numbers
no
sooner
was
the
gallant
plighted
fixed
than
all
his
rhymes
ran
counter
and
got
mixed
and
now
his
muse
continuously
slumbers
lullabied
by
the
law
eternal
hum
thus
you
see
looks
at
svanhild
are
you
cold
svanhild
softly
no
falk
with
forced
humour
since
the
sum
works
out
a
minus
then
in
every
case
and
never
shows
a
plus
why
should
you
be
so
resolute
your
capital
to
place
in
such
a
questionable
lottery
guldstad
looks
at
him
smiles
and
shakes
his
head
my
bold
young
falk
reserve
a
while
your
there
are
two
ways
of
founding
an
estate
it
may
be
built
on
credit
drafts
on
pleasure
in
a
bout
on
perpetuity
of
youth
unbated
and
permanent
postponement
of
the
gout
it
may
be
built
on
lips
of
rosy
red
on
sparkling
eyes
and
locks
of
flowing
gold
on
trust
these
glories
never
will
be
shed
nor
the
dread
hour
of
periwigs
be
tolled
it
may
be
built
on
thoughts
that
glow
and
quiver
flowers
blowing
in
the
sandy
wilderness
on
hearts
that
to
the
end
of
life
for
ever
throb
with
the
passion
of
the
primal
yes
to
dealings
such
as
this
the
world
extends
one
epithet
is
known
as
humbug
friends
falk
i
see
you
are
a
dangerous
attorney
you
a
millionaire
while
two
broad
backs
could
carry
in
one
journey
all
that
beneath
the
sun
belongs
to
me
guldstad
sharply
what
do
you
mean
falk
that
is
not
hard
to
see
for
the
sound
way
of
building
i
suppose
is
just
with
cash
the
paint
that
round
the
widow
batten
forehead
throws
the
aureole
of
a
young
adored
saint
guldstad
o
no
is
something
better
that
i
meant
is
the
still
flow
of
generous
esteem
which
no
less
honours
the
recipient
than
does
young
rapture
dream
it
is
the
feeling
of
the
blessedness
of
service
and
home
quiet
and
tender
ties
the
joy
of
mutual
of
keeping
watch
lest
any
stone
distress
her
footsteps
her
pathway
lies
it
is
the
healing
arm
of
a
true
friend
the
manly
muscle
that
no
burdens
bend
the
constancy
no
length
of
years
decays
the
arm
that
stoutly
lifts
and
firmly
stays
this
svanhild
is
the
contribution
i
bring
to
your
fortune
fabric
now
reply
svanhild
makes
an
effort
to
speak
guldstad
lifts
his
hand
to
check
her
consider
well
before
you
give
your
voice
with
clear
deliberation
make
your
choice
falk
and
how
have
you
discovered
guldstad
that
i
love
her
that
in
your
eyes
was
easy
to
discover
let
her
too
know
it
presses
his
hand
now
i
will
go
in
let
the
jest
cease
and
earnest
work
begin
and
if
you
undertake
that
till
the
end
you
be
to
her
no
less
a
faithful
friend
a
staff
to
lean
on
and
a
help
in
need
than
i
can
be
turning
to
svanhild
cancel
it
from
the
tables
of
your
thought
then
it
is
i
who
triumph
in
very
deed
you
happy
and
for
nothing
else
i
fought
to
falk
and
apropos
just
now
you
spoke
of
cash
trust
me
is
little
more
than
tinsell
trash
i
have
not
ties
stand
perfectly
alone
to
you
i
will
make
over
all
i
own
my
daughter
she
shall
be
and
you
my
son
you
know
i
have
a
business
by
the
border
there
i
retire
you
set
your
home
in
order
and
we
foregather
when
a
year
is
gone
now
falk
you
know
me
with
the
same
precision
observe
yourself
the
voyage
down
life
stream
remember
is
no
pastime
and
no
dream
now
in
the
name
of
god
make
your
decision
goes
into
the
house
pause
falk
and
svanhild
look
shyly
at
each
other
falk
you
are
so
pale
svanhild
and
you
so
silent
falk
true
svanhild
he
smote
us
hardest
falk
to
himself
stole
my
armour
too
svanhild
what
blows
he
struck
falk
he
knew
to
place
them
well
svanhild
all
seemed
to
go
to
pieces
where
they
fell
coming
nearer
to
him
how
rich
in
one
another
wealth
before
we
were
when
all
had
left
us
in
despite
and
thought
rose
upward
like
the
echoing
roar
of
breakers
in
the
silence
of
the
night
with
exultation
then
we
faced
the
fray
and
confidence
that
love
is
lord
of
death
he
came
with
worldly
cunning
stole
our
faith
sowed
doubt
and
all
the
glory
pass
away
falk
with
wild
vehemence
tear
tear
it
from
thy
memory
all
his
talk
was
true
for
others
but
for
us
a
lie
svanhild
slowly
shaking
her
head
the
golden
grain
on
its
stalk
will
never
more
wave
wanton
to
the
sky
falk
with
an
outburst
of
anguish
yes
we
two
svanhild
svanhild
hence
with
hopes
that
snare
if
you
sow
falsehood
you
must
reap
despair
for
others
true
you
say
and
do
you
doubt
that
each
of
them
like
us
is
sure
alike
that
he
the
man
the
lightning
will
not
strike
and
no
avenging
thunder
will
find
out
whom
the
blue
scudding
up
the
sky
on
wings
of
tempest
never
can
come
nigh
falk
the
others
split
their
souls
on
scattered
ends
thy
single
love
my
being
comprehends
they
hoarse
with
yelling
in
life
babel
din
i
in
this
quiet
shelter
fold
thee
in
svanhild
but
if
love
notwithstanding
should
decay
love
being
happiness
single
stay
could
you
avert
then
happiness
fall
falk
no
my
love
ruin
were
the
wreck
of
all
svanhild
and
can
you
promise
me
before
the
lord
that
it
will
last
not
drooping
like
the
flower
but
smell
as
sweet
as
now
till
life
last
hour
falk
after
a
short
pause
it
will
last
long
svanhild
long
long
poor
starveling
word
can
long
give
any
comfort
in
love
need
it
is
her
blight
upon
her
seed
my
faith
is
love
will
never
pass
away
that
song
must
cease
and
in
its
stead
be
heard
my
faith
is
that
i
loved
you
yesterday
as
uplifted
by
inspiration
no
no
not
thus
our
day
of
bliss
shall
wane
flag
drearily
to
west
in
clouds
and
rain
but
at
high
noontide
when
it
is
most
bright
plunge
sudden
like
a
meteor
into
the
night
falk
what
would
you
svanhild
svanhild
we
are
of
the
spring
no
autumn
shall
come
after
when
the
bird
of
music
in
thy
breast
shall
not
be
heard
and
long
not
thither
where
it
first
took
wing
nor
ever
winter
shall
his
snowy
shroud
lay
on
the
body
of
our
bliss
this
love
of
ours
ardent
and
glad
and
proud
pure
of
disease
taint
and
age
cloud
shall
die
the
young
and
glorious
thing
it
is
falk
in
deep
pain
and
far
from
thee
what
would
be
left
of
life
svanhild
and
near
me
what
were
left
if
love
depart
falk
a
home
svanhild
where
joy
would
gasp
in
mortal
strife
firmly
it
was
not
given
to
me
to
be
your
wife
that
is
the
clear
conviction
of
my
heart
in
courtship
merry
pastime
i
can
lead
but
not
sustain
your
spirit
in
its
need
nearer
and
gathering
fire
now
we
have
revell
out
a
feast
of
spring
no
thought
of
slumber
sluggard
couch
come
nigh
let
joy
amid
delirious
song
make
wing
and
flock
with
choirs
of
cherubim
on
high
and
tho
the
vessel
of
our
fate
capsize
one
plank
yet
breasts
the
waters
strong
to
save
the
fearless
swimmer
reaches
paradise
let
joy
go
down
into
his
watery
grave
our
love
shall
yet
triumph
by
god
hand
be
borne
from
out
the
wreckage
safe
to
land
falk
o
i
divine
thee
but
to
sever
thus
now
when
the
portals
of
the
world
stand
wide
when
the
blue
spring
is
bending
over
us
on
the
same
day
that
plighted
thee
my
bride
svanhild
just
therefore
must
we
part
our
joy
torch
fire
will
from
this
moment
wane
till
it
expire
and
when
at
last
our
worldly
days
are
spent
and
face
to
face
with
our
great
judge
we
stand
and
as
righteous
god
he
shall
demand
of
us
the
earthly
treasure
that
he
lent
then
falk
we
cry
past
power
of
grace
to
save
o
lord
we
lost
it
going
to
the
grave
falk
with
strong
resolve
pluck
off
the
ring
svanhild
with
fire
wilt
thou
falk
now
i
divine
thus
and
no
otherwise
canst
thou
be
mine
as
the
grave
opens
into
life
so
love
with
life
may
not
espoused
be
till
loosed
from
longing
and
from
wild
desire
pluck
off
the
ring
svanhild
svanhild
in
rapture
my
task
is
done
now
i

filled
thy
soul
with
song
and

forth
now

soarest
on
triumphant
wings
forth
now
thy
svanhild
is
the
swan
that
sings
takes
off
the
ring
and
presses
a
kiss
upon
it
to
the
abysmal
ooze
of

my
dream
i

thee
in
its
stead

a
few
steps
back

the
ring
into
the

approaches
falk
with
a
transfigured
expression
now
for
this
earthly
life
i

foregone
thee
but
for
the

eternal
i

won
thee
falk
firmly
and
now
to

our
paths

mingle
each
must
wage
his
warfare
without
moan
we
caught
the
fevered
frenzy
of
the

fain
without
fighting
to
secure
the
spoil
win
sabbath
ease
and
shirk
the
six
