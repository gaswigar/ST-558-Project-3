preface
no
new
edition
of
bulfinch
classic
work
can
be
considered
complete
without
some
notice
of
the
american
scholar
to
whose
wide
erudition
and
painstaking
care
it
stands
as
a
perpetual
monument
the
age
of
fable
has
come
to
be
ranked
with
older
books
like
pilgrim
progress
gulliver
travels
the
arabian
nights
robinson
crusoe
and
five
or
six
other
productions
of
renown
as
a
work
with
which
every
one
must
claim
some
acquaintance
before
his
education
can
be
called
really
complete
many
readers
of
the
present
edition
will
probably
recall
coming
in
contact
with
the
work
as
children
and
it
may
be
added
will
no
doubt
discover
from
a
fresh
perusal
the
source
of
numerous
bits
of
knowledge
that
have
remained
stored
in
their
minds
since
those
early
years
yet
to
the
majority
of
this
great
circle
of
readers
and
students
the
name
bulfinch
in
itself
has
no
significance
thomas
bulfinch
was
a
native
of
boston
where
he
was
born
in
his
boyhood
was
spent
in
that
city
and
he
prepared
for
college
in
the
boston
schools
he
finished
his
scholastic
training
at
harvard
college
and
after
taking
his
degree
was
for
a
period
a
teacher
in
his
home
city
for
a
long
time
later
in
life
he
was
employed
as
an
accountant
in
the
boston
merchants
bank
his
leisure
time
he
used
for
further
pursuit
of
the
classical
studies
which
he
had
begun
at
harvard
and
his
chief
pleasure
in
life
lay
in
writing
out
the
results
of
his
reading
in
simple
condensed
form
for
young
or
busy
readers
the
plan
he
followed
in
this
work
to
give
it
the
greatest
possible
usefulness
is
set
forth
in

scrupulous
care
has
been
taken
to
follow
the
original
text
of
bulfinch
but
attention
should
be
called
to
some
additional
sections
which
have
been
inserted
to
add
to
the
rounded
completeness
of
the
work
and
which
the
publishers
believe
would
meet
with
the
sanction
of
the
author
himself
as
in
no
way
intruding
upon
his
original
plan
but
simply
carrying
it
out
in
more
complete
detail
the
section
on
northern
mythology
has
been
enlarged
by
a
retelling
of
the
epic
of
the
nibelungen
lied
together
with
a
summary
of
wagner
version
of
the
legend
in
his
series
of
under
the
head
of
hero
myths
of
the
british
race
have
been
included
outlines
of
the
stories
of
beowulf
cuchulain
hereward
the
wake
and
robin
hood
of
the
verse
extracts
which
occur
throughout
the
text
thirty
or
more
have
been
added
from
literature
which
has
appeared
since
bulfinch
time
extracts
that
he
would
have
been
likely
to
quote
had
he
personally
supervised
the
new
edition
finally
the
index
has
been
thoroughly
overhauled
and
indeed
remade
all
the
proper
names
in
the
work
have
been
entered
with
references
to
the
pages
where
they
occur
and
a
concise
explanation
or
definition
of
each
has
been
given
thus
what
was
a
mere
list
of
names
in
the
original
has
been
enlarged
into
a
small
classical
and
mythological
dictionary
which
it
is
hoped
will
prove
valuable
for
reference
purposes
not
necessarily
connected
with
the
age
of
fable
acknowledgments
are
due
the
writings
of
oliver
huckel
for
information
on
the
point
of
wagner
rendering
of
the
nibelungen
legend
and
ebbutt
authoritative
volume
on
hero
myths
and

of
the
british
race
from
which
much
of
the
information
concerning
the
british
heroes
has
been
obtained
author
preface
if
no
other
knowledge
deserves
to
be
called
useful
but
that
which
helps
to
enlarge
our
possessions
or
to
raise
our
station
in
society
then
mythology
has
no
claim
to
the
appellation
but
if
that
which
tends
to
make
us
happier
and
better
can
be
called
useful
then
we
claim
that
epithet
for
our
subject
for
mythology
is
the
handmaid
of
literature
and
literature
is
one
of
the
best
allies
of
virtue
and
promoters
of
happiness
without
a
knowledge
of
mythology
much
of
the
elegant
literature
of
our
own
language
can
not
be
understood
and
appreciated
when
byron
calls
rome
the
niobe
of
nations
or
says
of
venice
she
looks
a
fresh
from
ocean
he
calls
up
to
the
mind
of
one
familiar
with
our
subject
illustrations
more
vivid
and
striking
than
the
pencil
could
furnish
but
which
are
lost
to
the
reader
ignorant
of
mythology
milton
abounds
in
similar
allusions
the
short
poem
comus
contains
more
than
thirty
such
and
the
ode
on
the
morning
of
the
nativity
half
as
many
through
paradise
lost
they
are
scattered
profusely
this
is
one
reason
why
we
often
hear
persons
by
no
means
illiterate
say
that
they
can
not
enjoy
milton
but
were
these
persons
to
add
to
their
more
solid
acquirements
the
easy
learning
of
this
little
volume
much
of
the
poetry
of
milton
which
has
appeared
to
them
harsh
and
crabbed
would
be
found
musical
as
is
apollo
lute
our
citations
taken
from
more
than
poets
from
spenser
to
longfellow
will
show
how
general
has
been
the
practice
of
borrowing
illustrations
from
mythology
the
prose
writers
also
avail
themselves
of
the
same
source
of
elegant
and
suggestive
illustration
one
can
hardly
take
up
a
number
of
the
edinburgh
or
quarterly
review
without
meeting
with
instances
in
macaulay
article
on
milton
there
are
twenty
such
but
how
is
mythology
to
be
taught
to
one
who
does
not
learn
it
through
the
medium
of
the
languages
of
greece
and
rome
to
devote
study
to
a
species
of
learning
which
relates
wholly
to
false
marvels
and
obsolete
faiths
is
not
to
be
expected
of
the
general
reader
in
a
practical
age
like
this
the
time
even
of
the
young
is
claimed
by
so
many
sciences
of
facts
and
things
that
little
can
be
spared
for
set
treatises
on
a
science
of
mere
fancy
but
may
not
the
requisite
knowledge
of
the
subject
be
acquired
by
reading
the
ancient
poets
in
translations
we
reply
the
field
is
too
extensive
for
a
preparatory
course
and
these
very
translations
require
some
previous
knowledge
of
the
subject
to
make
them
intelligible
let
any
one
who
doubts
it
read
the
first
page
of
the
aeneid
and
see
what
he
can
make
of
the
hatred
of
juno
the
decree
of
the
parcae
the
judgment
of
paris
and
the
honors
of
ganymede
without
this
knowledge
shall
we
be
told
that
answers
to
such
queries
may
be
found
in
notes
or
by
a
reference
to
the
classical
dictionary
we
reply
the
interruption
of
one
reading
by
either
process
is
so
annoying
that
most
readers
prefer
to
let
an
allusion
pass
unapprehended
rather
than
submit
to
it
moreover
such
sources
give
us
only
the
dry
facts
without
any
of
the
charm
of
the
original
narrative
and
what
is
a
poetical
myth
when
stripped
of
its
poetry
the
story
of
ceyx
and
halcyone
which
fills
a
chapter
in
our
book
occupies
but
eight
lines
in
the
best
smith
classical
dictionary
and
so
of
others
our
work
is
an
attempt
to
solve
this
problem
by
telling
the
stories
of
mythology
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
them
a
source
of
amusement
we
have
endeavored
to
tell
them
correctly
according
to
the
ancient
authorities
so
that
when
the
reader
finds
them
referred
to
he
may
not
be
at
a
loss
to
recognize
the
reference
thus
we
hope
to
teach
mythology
not
as
a
study
but
as
a
relaxation
from
study
to
give
our
work
the
charm
of
a
yet
by
means
of
it
to
impart
a
knowledge
of
an
important
branch
of
education
the
index
at
the
end
will
adapt
it
to
the
purposes
of
reference
and
make
it
a
classical
dictionary
for
the
parlor
most
of
the
classical
legends
in
stories
of
gods
and
heroes
are
derived
from
ovid
and
virgil
they
are
not
literally
translated
for
in
the
author
opinion
poetry
translated
into
literal
prose
is
very
unattractive
reading
neither
are
they
in
verse
as
well
for
other
reasons
as
from
a
conviction
that
to
translate
faithfully
under
all
the
embarrassments
of
rhyme
and
measure
is
impossible
the
attempt
has
been
made
to
tell
the
stories
in
prose
preserving
so
much
of
the
poetry
as
resides
in
the
thoughts
and
is
separable
from
the
language
itself
and
omitting
those
amplifications
which
are
not
suited
to
the
altered
form
the
northern
mythological
stories
are
copied
with
some
abridgment
from
mallet
northern
antiquities
these
chapters
with
those
on
oriental
and
egyptian
mythology
seemed
necessary
to
complete
the
subject
though
it
is
believed
these
topics
have
not
usually
been
presented
in
the
same
volume
with
the
classical
fables
the
poetical
citations
so
freely
introduced
are
expected
to
answer
several
valuable
purposes
they
will
tend
to
fix
in
memory
the
leading
fact
of
each
story
they
will
help
to
the
attainment
of
a
correct
pronunciation
of
the
proper
names
and
they
will
enrich
the
memory
with
many
gems
of
poetry
some
of
them
such
as
are
most
frequently
quoted
or
alluded
to
in
reading
and
conversation
having
chosen
mythology
as
connected
with
literature
for
our
province
we
have
endeavored
to
omit
nothing
which
the
reader
of
elegant
literature
is
likely
to
find
occasion
for
such
stories
and
parts
of
stories
as
are
offensive
to
pure
taste
and
good
morals
are
not
given
but
such
stories
are
not
often
referred
to
and
if
they
occasionally
should
be
the
english
reader
need
feel
no
mortification
in
confessing
his
ignorance
of
them
our
work
is
not
for
the
learned
nor
for
the
theologian
nor
for
the
philosopher
but
for
the
reader
of
english
literature
of
either
sex
who
wishes
to
comprehend
the
allusions
so
frequently
made
by
public
speakers
lecturers
essayists
and
poets
and
those
which
occur
in
polite
conversation
in
the
stories
of
gods
and
heroes
the
compiler
has
endeavored
to
impart
the
pleasures
of
classical
learning
to
the
english
reader
by
presenting
the
stories
of
pagan
mythology
in
a
form
adapted
to
modern
taste
in
king
arthur
and
his
knights
and
the
mabinogeon
the
attempt
has
been
made
to
treat
in
the
same
way
the
stories
of
the
second
age
of
fable
the
age
which
witnessed
the
dawn
of
the
several
states
of
modern
europe
it
is
believed
that
this
presentation
of
a
literature
which
held
unrivalled
sway
over
the
imaginations
of
our
ancestors
for
many
centuries
will
not
be
without
benefit
to
the
reader
in
addition
to
the
amusement
it
may
afford
the
tales
though
not
to
be
trusted
for
their
facts
are
worthy
of
all
credit
as
pictures
of
manners
and
it
is
beginning
to
be
held
that
the
manners
and
modes
of
thinking
of
an
age
are
a
more
important
part
of
its
history
than
the
conflicts
of
its
peoples
generally
leading
to
no
result
besides
this
the
literature
of
romance
is
a
of
poetical
material
to
which
modern
poets
frequently
resort
the
italian
poets
dante
and
ariosto
the
english
spenser
scott
and
tennyson
and
our
own
longfellow
and
lowell
are
examples
of
this
these
legends
are
so
connected
with
each
other
so
consistently
adapted
to
a
group
of
characters
strongly
individualized
in
arthur
launcelot
and
their
compeers
and
so
lighted
up
by
the
fires
of
imagination
and
invention
that
they
seem
as
well
adapted
to
the
poet
purpose
as
the
legends
of
the
greek
and
roman
mythology
and
if
every
young
person
is
expected
to
know
the
story
of
the
golden
fleece
why
is
the
quest
of
the
sangreal
less
worthy
of
his
acquaintance
or
if
an
allusion
to
the
shield
of
achilles
ought
not
to
pass
unapprehended
why
should
one
to
excalibar
the
famous
sword
of
arthur
of
arthur
who
to
upper
light
restored
with
that
terrific
sword
which
yet
he
brandishes
for
future
war
shall
lift
his
country
fame
above
the
polar
star
footnote
wordsworth
it
is
an
additional
recommendation
of
our
subject
that
it
tends
to
cherish
in
our
minds
the
idea
of
the
source
from
which
we
sprung
we
are
entitled
to
our
full
share
in
the
glories
and
recollections
of
the
land
of
our
forefathers
down
to
the
time
of
colonization
thence
the
associations
which
spring
from
this
source
must
be
fruitful
of
good
influences
among
which
not
the
least
valuable
is
the
increased
enjoyment
which
such
associations
afford
to
the
american
traveller
when
he
visits
england
and
sets
his
foot
upon
any
of
her
renowned
localities
the
legends
of
charlemagne
and
his
peers
are
necessary
to
complete
the
subject
in
an
age
when
intellectual
darkness
enveloped
western
europe
a
constellation
of
brilliant
writers
arose
in
italy
of
these
pulci
born
in
boiardo
and
ariosto
took
for
their
subjects
the
romantic
fables
which
had
for
many
ages
been
transmitted
in
the
lays
of
bards
and
the
legends
of
monkish
chroniclers
these
fables
they
arranged
in
order
adorned
with
the
embellishments
of
fancy
amplified
from
their
own
invention
and
stamped
with
immortality
it
may
safely
be
asserted
that
as
long
as
civilization
shall
endure
these
productions
will
retain
their
place
among
the
most
cherished
creations
of
human
genius
in
stories
of
gods
and
heroes
king
arthur
and
his
knights
and
the
mabinogeon
the
aim
has
been
to
supply
to
the
modern
reader
such
knowledge
of
the
fables
of
classical
and
mediaeval
literature
as
is
needed
to
render
intelligible
the
allusions
which
occur
in
reading
and
conversation
the
legends
of
charlemagne
is
intended
to
carry
out
the
same
design
like
the
earlier
portions
of
the
work
it
aspires
to
a
higher
character
than
that
of
a
piece
of
mere
amusement
it
claims
to
be
useful
in
acquainting
its
readers
with
the
subjects
of
the
productions
of
the
great
poets
of
italy
some
knowledge
of
these
is
expected
of
every
young
person
in
reading
these
romances
we
can
not
fail
to
observe
how
the
primitive
inventions
have
been
used
again
and
again
by
successive
generations
of
fabulists
the
siren
of
ulysses
is
the
prototype
of
the
siren
of
orlando
and
the
character
of
circe
reappears
in
alcina
the
fountains
of
love
and
hatred
may
be
traced
to
the
story
of
cupid
and
psyche
and
similar
effects
produced
by
a
magic
draught
appear
in
the
tale
of
tristram
and
isoude
and
substituting
a
flower
for
the
draught
in
shakspeare
midsummer
night
dream
there
are
many
other
instances
of
the
same
kind
which
the
reader
will
recognize
without
our
assistance
the
sources
whence
we
derive
these
stories
are
first
the
italian
poets
named
above
next
the
romans
de
chevalerie
of
the
comte
de

lastly
certain
german
collections
of
popular
tales
some
chapters
have
been
borrowed
from

translations
from
the

it
seemed
unnecessary
to
do
over
again
what

had
already
done
so
well
yet
on

other
hand
those

chapter
i
introduction
the
religions
of
ancient
greece
and
rome
are
extinct
the
called
divinities
of
olympus
have
not
a
single
worshipper
among
living
men
they
belong
now
not
to
the
department
of
theology
but
to
those
of
literature
and
taste
there
they
still
hold
their
place
and
will
continue
to
hold
it
for
they
are
too
closely
connected
with
the
finest
productions
of
poetry
and
art
both
ancient
and
modern
to
pass
into
oblivion
we
propose
to
tell
the
stories
relating
to
them
which
have
come
down
to
us
from
the
ancients
and
which
are
alluded
to
by
modern
poets
essayists
and
orators
our
readers
may
thus
at
the
same
time
be
entertained
by
the
most
charming
fictions
which
fancy
has
ever
created
and
put
in
possession
of
information
indispensable
to
every
one
who
would
read
with
intelligence
the
elegant
literature
of
his
own
day
in
order
to
understand
these
stories
it
will
be
necessary
to
acquaint
ourselves
with
the
ideas
of
the
structure
of
the
universe
which
prevailed
among
the
greeks
the
people
from
whom
the
romans
and
other
nations
through
them
received
their
science
and
religion
the
greeks
believed
the
earth
to
be
flat
and
circular
their
own
country
occupying
the
middle
of
it
the
central
point
being
either
mount
olympus
the
abode
of
the
gods
or
delphi
so
famous
for
its
oracle
the
circular
disk
of
the
earth
was
crossed
from
west
to
east
and
divided
into
two
equal
parts
by
the
sea
as
they
called
the
mediterranean
and
its
continuation
the
euxine
the
only
seas
with
which
they
were
acquainted
around
the
earth
flowed
the
river
ocean
its
course
being
from
south
to
north
on
the
western
side
of
the
earth
and
in
a
contrary
direction
on
the
eastern
side
it
flowed
in
a
steady
equable
current
unvexed
by
storm
or
tempest
the
sea
and
all
the
rivers
on
earth
received
their
waters
from
it
the
northern
portion
of
the
earth
was
supposed
to
be
inhabited
by
a
happy
race
named
the
hyperboreans
dwelling
in
everlasting
bliss
and
spring
beyond
the
lofty
mountains
whose
caverns
were
supposed
to
send
forth
the
piercing
blasts
of
the
north
wind
which
chilled
the
people
of
hellas
greece
their
country
was
inaccessible
by
land
or
sea
they
lived
exempt
from
disease
or
old
age
from
toils
and
warfare
moore
has
given
us
the
song
of
a
hyperborean
beginning
i
come
from
a
land
in
the
deep
where
golden
gardens
glow
where
the
winds
of
the
north
becalmed
in
sleep
their
conch
shells
never
blow
on
the
south
side
of
the
earth
close
to
the
stream
of
ocean
dwelt
a
people
happy
and
virtuous
as
the
hyperboreans
they
were
named
the
aethiopians
the
gods
favored
them
so
highly
that
they
were
wont
to
leave
at
times
their
olympian
abodes
and
go
to
share
their
sacrifices
and
banquets
on
the
western
margin
of
the
earth
by
the
stream
of
ocean
lay
a
happy
place
named
the
elysian
plain
whither
mortals
favored
by
the
gods
were
transported
without
tasting
of
death
to
enjoy
an
immortality
of
bliss
this
happy
region
was
also
called
the
fortunate
fields
and
the
isles
of
the
blessed
we
thus
see
that
the
greeks
of
the
early
ages
knew
little
of
any
real
people
except
those
to
the
east
and
south
of
their
own
country
or
near
the
coast
of
the
mediterranean
their
imagination
meantime
peopled
the
western
portion
of
this
sea
with
giants
monsters
and
enchantresses
while
they
placed
around
the
disk
of
the
earth
which
they
probably
regarded
as
of
no
great
width
nations
enjoying
the
peculiar
favor
of
the
gods
and
blessed
with
happiness
and
longevity
the
dawn
the
sun
and
the
moon
were
supposed
to
rise
out
of
the
ocean
on
the
eastern
side
and
to
drive
through
the
air
giving
light
to
gods
and
men
the
stars
also
except
those
forming
the
wain
or
bear
and
others
near
them
rose
out
of
and
sank
into
the
stream
of
ocean
there
the
embarked
in
a
winged
boat
which
conveyed
him
round
by
the
northern
part
of
the
earth
back
to
his
place
of
rising
in
the
east
milton
alludes
to
this
in
his
comus

shoots
against
the
dusky
pole
pacing
towards
the
other
goal
of
his
chamber
in
the
east
the
abode
of
the
gods
was
on
the
summit
of
mount
olympus
in
thessaly
a
gate
of
clouds
kept
by
the
goddesses
named
the
seasons
opened
to
permit
the
passage
of
the
celestials
to
earth
and
to
receive
them
on
their
return
the
gods
had
their
separate
dwellings
but
all
when
summoned
repaired
to
the
palace
of
jupiter
as
did
also
those
deities
whose
usual
abode
was
the
earth
the
waters
or
the
underworld
it
was
also
in
the
great
hall
of
the
palace
of
the
olympian
king
that
the
gods
feasted
each
day
on
ambrosia
and
nectar
their
food
and
drink
the
latter
being
handed
round
by
the
lovely
goddess
hebe
here
they
conversed
of
the
affairs
of
heaven
and
earth
and
as
they
quaffed
their
nectar
apollo
the
god
of
music
delighted
them
with
the
tones
of
his
lyre
to
which
the
muses
sang
in
responsive
strains
when
the
sun
was
set
the
gods
retired
to
sleep
in
their
respective
dwellings
the
following
lines
from
the
odyssey
will
show
how
homer
conceived
of
olympus
so
saying
minerva
goddess
rose
to
olympus
the
reputed
seat
eternal
of
the
gods
which
never
storms
disturb

or
snow
invades
but
calm
the
expanse
and
cloudless
shmes
with
purest
day
there
the
inhabitants
divine
rejoice
forever
cowper
the
robes
and
other
parts
of
the
dress
of
the
goddesses
were
woven
by
minerva
and
the
graces
and
everything
of
a
more
solid
nature
was
formed
of
the
various
metals
vulcan
was
architect
smith
armorer
chariot
builder
and
artist
of
all
work
in
olympus
he
built
of
brass
the
houses
of
the
gods
he
made
for
them
the
golden
shoes
with
which
they
trod
the
air
or
the
water
and
moved
from
place
to
place
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
or
even
of
thought
he
also
shod
with
brass
the
celestial
steeds
which
whirled
the
chariots
of
the
gods
through
the
air
or
along
the
surface
of
the
sea
he
was
able
to
bestow
on
his
workmanship
so
that
the
tripods
chairs
and
tables
could
move
of
themselves
in
and
out
of
the
celestial
hall
he
even
endowed
with
intelligence
the
golden
handmaidens
whom
he
made
to
wait
on
himself

the

and

himself
a
beginning
saturn
cronos

his

ops
his

saturn
and
rhea
were
of
the
race
of
titans
who
were
the
children
of
earth
and
heaven
which
sprang
from
chaos
of
which
we
shall
give
a
further
account
in
our
next
chapter
there
is
another
cosmogony
or
account
of
the
creation
according
to
which
earth
erebus
and
love
were
the
first
of
beings
love
eros
issued
from
the
egg
of
night
which
floated
on
chaos
by
his
arrows
and
torch
he
pierced
and
vivified
all
things
producing
life
and
joy
saturn
and
rhea
were
not
the
only
titans
there
were
others
whose
names
were
oceanus
hyperion
iapetus
and
ophion
males
and
themis
mnemosyne
eurynome

they
are
spoken
of
as
the
elder
gods
whose
dominion
was
afterwards
transferred
to
others
saturn
yielded
to
jupiter
oceanus
to
neptune
hyperion
to
apollo
hyperion
was
the
father
of
the
sun
moon
and
dawn
he
is
therefore
the
original
and
is
painted
with
the
splendor
and

milton
alludes
to
them
in
paradise
lost
he
says
the
heathens
seem
to
have
had
some
knowledge
of
the
temptation
and
fall
of
man
and
fabled
how
the
serpent
whom
they
called
ophion
with
eurynome
the
encroaching
eve
perhaps
had
first
the
rule
of
high
olympus
thence
by
saturn
driven
the
representations
given
of
saturn
are
not
very
consistent
for
on
the
one
hand
his
reign
is
said
to
have
been
the
golden
age
of
innocence
and
purity
and
on
the
other
he
is
described
as
a
monster
who
devoured
his
children
footnote
this
inconsistency
arises
from
considering
the
saturn
of
the
romans
the
same
with
the
grecian
deity
cronos
time
which
as
it
brings
an
end
to
all
things
which
have
had
a
beginning
may
be
said
to
devour
its
own
offspring
jupiter
however
escaped
this
fate

when
grown
up
espoused
metis
prudence

administered
a
draught
to

which
caused
him
to

out

in
a

occurred
between

vulcan
lameness
according
to

falling
and
at

which
was
thenceforth
sacred
to

venus
aphrodite
the
goddess
of

that
venus
sprang
from

foam
of
the

the
zephyr
wafted
her
along
the
waves
to
the
isle
of
cyprus
where
she
was
received
and
attired
by
the
seasons
and
then
led
to
the
assembly
of
the
gods
all
were
charmed
with
her
beauty
and
each
one
demanded
her
for
his
wife
jupiter
gave
her
to
vulcan
in
gratitude
for
the
service
he
had
rendered
in
forging
thunderbolts
so
the
most
beautiful
of
the
goddesses
became
the
wife
of
the
most
of
gods
venus
possessed
an
embroidered
girdle
called
cestus
which
had
the
power
of
inspiring
love
her
favorite
birds
were
swans
and
doves
and
the
plants
sacred
to
her
were
the
rose
and
the
myrtle
cupid
eros
the
god
of
love
was
the
son
of
venus
he
was
her
constant
companion
and
armed
with
bow
and
arrows
he
shot
the
darts
of
desire
into
the
bosoms
of
both
gods
and
men
there
was
a
deity
named
anteros
who
was
sometimes
represented
as
the
avenger
of
slighted
love
and
sometimes
as
the
symbol
of
reciprocal
affection
the
following
legend
is
told
of
him
venus
complaining
to
themis
that
her
son
eros
continued
always
a
child
was
told
by
her
that
it
was
because
he
was
solitary
and
that
if
he
had
a
brother
he
would
grow
apace
anteros
was
soon
afterwards
born
and
eros
immediately
was
seen
to
increase
rapidly
in
size
and
strength
minerva
pallas
athene
the
goddess
of
wisdom
was
the
offspring
of

without

sacred
to
her
the

byron

also
household
gods
but
differed
from
the

in
being
regarded
as
the

of

the

prometheus
and
pandora
the
creation
of
the
world
is
a
problem
naturally
fitted
to
excite
the
liveliest
interest
of
man
its
inhabitant
the
ancient
pagans
not
having
the
information
on
the
subject
which
we
derive
from
the
pages
of
scripture
had
their
own
way
of
telling
the
story
which
is
as
follows
before
earth
and
sea
and
heaven
were
created
all
things
wore
one
aspect
to
which
we
give
the
name
of
chaos
a
confused
and
shapeless
mass
nothing
but
dead
weight
in
which
however
slumbered
the
seeds
of
things
earth
sea
and
air
were
all
mixed
up
together
so
the
earth
was
not
solid
the
sea
was
not
fluid
and
the
air
was
not
transparent
god
and
nature
at
last
interposed
and
put
an
end
to
this
discord
separating
earth
from
sea
and
heaven
from
both
the
fiery
part
being
the
lightest
sprang
up
and
formed
the
skies
the
air
was
next
in
weight
and
place
the
earth
being
heavier
sank
below
and
the
water
took
the
lowest
place
and
buoyed
up
the
earth
here
some
god
it
is
not
known
which
gave
his
good
offices
in
arranging
and
disposing
the
earth
he
appointed
rivers
and
bays
their
places
raised
mountains
scooped
out
valleys
distributed
woods
fountains
fertile
fields
and
stony
plains
the
air
being
cleared
the
stars
began
to
appear
fishes
took
possession
of
the
sea
birds
of
the
air
and
beasts
of
the
land
but
a
nobler
animal
was
wanted
and
man
was
made
it
is
not
known
whether
the
creator
made
him
of
divine
materials
or
whether
in
the
earth
so
lately
separated
from
heaven
there
lurked
still
some
heavenly
seeds
prometheus
took
some
of
this
earth
and
kneading
it
up
with
water
made
man
in
the
image
of
the
gods
he
gave
him
an
upright
stature
so
that
while
all
other
animals
turn
their
faces
downward
and
look
to
the
earth
he
raises
his
to
heaven
and
gazes
on
the
stars
prometheus
was
one
of
the
titans
a
gigantic
race
who
inhabited
the
earth
before
the
creation
of
man
to
him
and
his
brother
epimetheus
was
committed
the
office
of
making
man
and
providing
him
and
all
other
animals
with
the
faculties
necessary
for
their
preservation
epimetheus
undertook
to
do
this
and
prometheus
was
to
overlook
his
work
when
it
was
done
epimetheus
accordingly
proceeded
to
bestow
upon
the
different
animals
the
various
gifts
of
courage
strength
swiftness
sagacity
wings
to
one
claws
to
another
a
shelly
covering
to
a
third
etc
but
when
man
came
to
be
provided
for
who
was
to
be
superior
to
all
other
animals
epimetheus
had
been
so
prodigal
of
his
resources
that
he
had
nothing
left
to
bestow
upon
him
in
his
perplexity
he
resorted
to
his
brother
prometheus
who
with
the
aid
of
minerva
went
up
to
heaven
and
lighted
his
torch
at
the
chariot
of
the
sun
and
brought
down
fire
to
man
with
this
gift
man
was
more
than
a
match
for
all
other
animals
it
enabled
him
to
make
weapons
wherewith
to
subdue
them
tools
with
which
to
cultivate
the
earth
to
warm
his
dwelling
so
as
to
be
comparatively
independent
of
climate
and
finally
to
introduce
the
arts
and
to
coin
money
the
means
of
trade
and
commerce
woman
was
not
yet
made
the
story
absurd
enough
is
that
jupiter
made
her
and
sent
her
to
prometheus
and
his
brother
to
punish
them
for
their
presumption
in
stealing
fire
from
heaven
and
man
for
accepting
the
gift
the
first
woman
was
named
pandora
she
was
made
in
heaven
every
god
contributing
something
to
perfect
her
venus
gave
her
beauty
mercury
persuasion
apollo
music
etc
thus
equipped
she
was
conveyed
to
earth
and
presented
to
epimetheus
who
gladly
accepted
her
though
cautioned
by
his
brother
to
beware
of
jupiter
and
his
gifts
epimetheus
had
in
his
house
a
jar
in
which
were
kept
certain
noxious
articles
for
which
in
fitting
man
for
his
new
abode
he
had
had
no
occasion
pandora
was
seized
with
an
eager
curiosity
to
know
what
this
jar
contained
and
one
day
she
slipped
off
the
cover
and
looked
in
forthwith
there
escaped
a
multitude
of
plagues
for
hapless
man
such
as
gout
rheumatism
and
colic
for
his
body
and
envy
spite
and
revenge
for
his
mind
and
scattered
themselves
far
and
wide
pandora
hastened
to
replace
the
lid
but
alas
the
whole
contents
of
the
jar
had
escaped
one
thing
only
excepted
which
lay
at
the
bottom
and
that
was
hope
so
we
see
at
this
day
whatever
evils
are
abroad
hope
never
entirely
leaves
us
and
while
we
have
that
no
amount
of
other
ills
can
make
us
completely
wretched
another
story
is
that
pandora
was
sent
in
good
faith
by
jupiter
to
bless
man
that
she
was
furnished
with
a
box
containing
her
marriage
presents
into
which
every
god
had
put
some
blessing
she
opened
the
box
incautiously
and
the
blessings
all
escaped
hope
only
excepted
this
story
seems
more
probable
than
the
former
for
how
could
hope
so
precious
a
jewel
as
it
is
have
been
kept
in
a
jar
full
of
all
manner
of
evils
as
in
the
former
statement
the
world
being
thus
furnished
with
inhabitants
the
first
age
was
an
age
of
innocence
and
happiness
called
the
golden
age
truth
and
right
prevailed
though
not
enforced
by
law
nor
was
there
any
magistrate
to
threaten
or
punish
the
forest
had
not
yet
been
robbed
of
its
trees
to
furnish
timbers
for
vessels
nor
had
men
built
fortifications
round
their
towns
there
were
no
such
things
as
swords
spears
or
helmets
the
earth
brought
forth
all
things
necessary
for
man
without
his
labor
in
ploughing
or
sowing
perpetual
spring

sprang
up
without

the
rivers
flowed
with

and
wine
and

honey
distilled
from

oaks
then
succeeded
the
silver
age
inferior
to
the
golden
but
better
than
that
of
brass
jupiter
shortened
the
spring
and
divided
the
year
into
seasons
then
first
men
had
to
endure
the
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
and
houses
became
necessary
caves
were
the
first
dwellings
and
leafy
coverts
of
the
woods
and
huts
woven
of
twigs
crops

no
longer
grow
without
planting
the
farmer
was
obliged
to
sow
the
seed
and
the
toiling
ox
to
draw
the
plough
next
came
the
brazen
age
more
savage
of
temper
and
readier
to
the
strife
of
arms
yet
not
altogether
wicked
the
hardest
and
worst
was
the
iron
age
crime
burst
in
like
a

modesty
truth

fled
in

came
fraud

were
torn
from

to

for
keels
to

and
vex
the
face
of

the
earth
which
till
now
had
been
cultivated
in
common
began
to
be
divided
off
into
possessions
men
were
not
satisfied
with
what
the

produced
but
must
dig
into
its
bowels
and
draw
forth
from
thence
the
ores
of

mischievous
iron

mischievous

were
produced
war

seeing

he

set
forth
the
frightful
condition
of
things
on

and
closed
by
announcing
his
intention
to
destroy
the
whole
of
its
inhabitants
and
provide
a
new
race
unlike
the
first
who
would
be
more
worthy
of

much
better

of

so
saying
he
took
a
thunderbolt
and
was
about
to
launch
it
at
the
world
and
destroy
it
by
burning
but
recollecting
the
danger
that
such
a
conflagration
might
set
heaven
itself
on

he
changed
his
plan
and
resolved
to
drown

there
deucalion

of

found
refuge
he
a
just
man
and
she
a
faithful
worshipper
of
the

jupiter
when
he
saw
none
left
alive
but
this

and
remembered
their

ordered

to
drive

neptune
also
directed

to
blow

the

obeyed
and
the

returned
to

and

to
their
channels
then
deucalion
thus
addressed
pyrrha
o
wife
only
surviving
woman
joined
to
me
first
by
the
ties
of
kindred
and
marriage
and
now
by
a
common
danger
would
that
we
possessed
the
power
of
our
ancestor
prometheus
and
could
renew
the
race
as
he
at
first
made
it
but
as
we
can
not
let
us
seek
yonder
temple
and
inquire
of
the
gods
what
remains
for
us
to
do
they
entered
the
temple
deformed
as
it
was
with
slime
and
approached
the
altar
where
no
fire
burned
there
they
fell
prostrate
on
the
earth
and
prayed
the
goddess
to
inform
them
how
they
might
retrieve
their
miserable
affairs
the
oracle
answered
depart
from
the
temple
with
head
veiled
and
garments
unbound
and
cast
behind
you
the
bones
of
your
mother
they
heard
the
words
with
astonishment
pyrrha
first
broke
silence
we
can
not
obey
we
dare
not
profane
the
remains
of
our
parents
they
sought
the
thickest
shades
of
the
wood
and
revolved
the
oracle
in
their
minds
at
length
deucalion
spoke
either
my
sagacity
deceives
me
or
the
command
is
one
we
may
obey
without
impiety
the
earth
is
the
great
parent
of
all
the
stones
are
her
bones
these
we
may
cast
behind
us
and
i
think
this
is
what
the
oracle
means
at
least
it
will
do
no
harm
to
try
they
veiled
their
faces
unbound
their
garments
and
picked
up
stones
and
cast
them
behind
them
the
stones
wonderful
to
relate
began
to
grow
soft
and
assume
shape
by
degrees
they
put
on
a
rude
resemblance
to
the
human
form
like
a
block
in
the
hands
of
the
sculptor
the
moisture
and
slime
that
were
about
them
became
flesh
the
stony
part
became
bones
the
veins
remained
veins
retaining
their
name
only
changing
their
use
those
thrown
by
the
hand
of
the
man
became
men
and
those
by
the
woman
became
women
it
was
a
hard
race
and
well
adapted
to
labor
as
we
find
ourselves
to
be
at
this
day
giving
plain
indications
of
our
origin
the
comparison
of
eve
to
pandora
is
too
obvious
to
have
escaped
milton
who
introduces
it
in
book
iv
of
paradise
lost
more
lovely
than
pandora
whom
the
gods
endowed
with
all
their
gifts
and
o
too
like
in
sad
event
when
to
the
unwiser
son
of
japhet
brought
by
hermes
she
insnared
mankind
with
her
fair
looks
to
be
avenged
on
him
who
had
stole
jove
authentic
fire
prometheus
and
epimetheus
were
sons
of
iapetus
which
milton
changes
to
japhet
prometheus
has
been
a
favorite
subject
with
the
poets
he
is
represented
as
the
friend
of
mankind
who
interposed
in
their
behalf
when
jove
was
incensed
against
them
and
who
taught
them
civilization
and
the
arts
but
as
in
so
doing
he
transgressed
the
will
of
jupiter
he
drew
down
on
himself
the
anger
of
the
ruler
of
gods
and
men
jupiter
had
him
chained
to
a
rock
on
mount
caucasus
where
a
vulture
preyed
on
his
liver
which
was
renewed
as
fast
as
devoured
this
state
of
torment
might
have
been
brought
to
an
end
at
any
time
by
prometheus
if
he
had
been
willing
to
submit
to
his
oppressor
for
he
possessed
a
secret
which
involved
the
stability
of
jove
throne
and
if
he
would
have
revealed
it
he
might
have
been
at
once
taken
into
favor
but
that
he
disdained
to
do
he
has
therefore
become
the
symbol
of
magnanimous
endurance
of
unmerited
suffering
and
strength
of
will
resisting
oppression
byron
and
shelley
have
both
treated
this
theme
the
following
are
byron
lines
titan
to
whose
immortal
eyes
the
sufferings
of
mortality
seen
in
their
sad
reality
were
not
as
things
that

despise
what
was
thy
pity
recompense
a
silent
suffering
and
intense
the

the
vulture
and
the
chain
all
that
the
proud
can
feel
of
pain
the
agony
they
do
not
show
the
suffocating
sense
of
woe
thy
godlike
crime
was
to
be
kind
to
render
with
thy
precepts
less
the
sum
of
human
wretchedness
and
strengthen
man
with
his
own
mind
and
baffled
as
thou
wert
from
high
still
in
thy
patient
energy
in
the
endurance
and
repulse
of
thine
impenetrable
spirit
which
earth
and
heaven
could
not
convulse
a
mighty
lesson
we
inherit
byron
also
employs
the
same
allusion
in
his
ode
to
napoleon
bonaparte
or
like
the
thief
of

from

wilt
thou

it

apollo
saw
the
boy
playing
with
his
bow
and
arrows
and
being
himself
elated
with
his
recent
victory
over

he
said
to
him
what
have
you

weapons
saucy

leave

venus
boy
heard
these
words
and
rejoined
your
arrows
may
strike
all
things
else
apollo
but
mine
shall
strike
you
so
saying
he
took
his
stand
on
a
rock
of
parnassus
and
drew
from
his
quiver
two
arrows
of
different
workmanship
one
to
excite
love
the
other
to
repel
it
the
former
was
of
gold
and
sharp
pointed
the
latter
blunt
and
tipped
with
lead
with
the
leaden
shaft
he
struck
the
nymph
daphne
the
daughter
of
the
river
god
peneus
and
with
the
golden
one
apollo
through
the
heart
forthwith
the
god
was
seized
with
love
for
the
maiden
and
she
abhorred
the
thought
of
loving
her
delight
was
in
woodland
sports
and
in
the
spoils
of
the
chase
many
lovers
sought
her
but
she
spurned
them
all
ranging
the
woods
and
taking
no
thought
of
cupid
nor
of
hymen
her
father
often
said
to
her
daughter
you
owe
me
a
you
owe
me
grandchildren
she
hating
the
thought
of
marriage
as
a
crime
with
her
beautiful
face
tinged
all
over
with
blushes
threw
arms
around
her
father
neck
and
said
dearest
father
grant
me
this
favor
that
i
may
always
remain
unmarried
like
diana
he
consented
but
at
the
same
time
said
your
own
face
will
forbid
it
apollo
loved
her
and
longed
to
obtain
her
and
he
who
gives
oracles
to
all
the
world
was
not
wise
enough
to
look
into
his
own
fortunes
he
saw
her
hair
flung
loose
over
her
shoulders
and
said
if
so
charming
in
disorder
what
would
it
be
if
arranged
he
saw
her
eyes
bright
as
stars
he
saw
her
lips
and
was
not
satisfied
with
only
seeing
them
he
admired
her
hands
and
arms
naked
to
the
shoulder
and
whatever
was
hidden
from
view
he
imagined
more
beautiful
still
he
followed
her
she
fled
swifter
than
the
wind
and
delayed
not
a
moment
at
his
entreaties
stay
said
he
daughter
of
peneus
i
am
not
a

do
not
fly
me
as
a
lamb
flies
the
wolf
or
a

the

it
is
for
love
i
pursue
you
you
make
me
miserable
for
fear
you
should
fall
and
hurt
yourself
on
these
stones
and
i
should
be
the
cause
pray
run
slower
and
i
will
follow
slower
i
am
no
clown
no
rude
peasant
jupiter
is
my
father
and
i
am

of
delphos
and

and

all
things
present
and
future
i
am
the
god
of
song
and
the

my
arrows
fly
true
to
the
mark
but
alas
an
arrow
more
fatal
than
mine
has
pierced
my
heart
i
am
the
god
of
medicine
and
know
the
virtues
of
all
healing
plants
alas
i
suffer
a
malady
that
no
balm
can
cure
the
nymph
continued
her
flight
and
left
his
plea
half
uttered
and
even
as
she
fled
she
charmed
him
the
wind
blew
her
garments
and
her
unbound
hair
streamed
loose
behind
her
the
god
grew
impatient
to
find
his
wooings
thrown
away
and
sped
by
cupid
gained
upon
her
in
the
race
it
was
like
a
hound
pursuing
a
hare
with
open
jaws
ready
to
seize
while
the
feebler
animal
darts
forward
slipping
from
the
very
grasp
so
flew
the
god
and
the
virgin
he
on
the
wings
of
love
and
she
on
those
of
fear
the
pursuer
is
the
more
rapid
however
and
gains
upon
her
and
his
panting
breath
blows
upon
her
hair
her
strength
begins
to
fail
and
ready
to
sink
she
calls
upon
her
father
the
river
god
help
me
peneus
open
the
earth
to
enclose
me
or
change
my
form
which
has
brought
me
into
this
danger
scarcely
had
she
spoken
when
a
stiffness
seized
all
her
limbs
her
bosom
began
to
be
enclosed
in
a
tender
bark
her
hair
became
leaves
her
arms
became
branches
her
foot
stuck
fast
in
the
ground
as
a
root
her
face
became
a
retaining
nothing
of
its
former
self
but
its
beauty
apollo
stood
amazed
he
touched
the
stem
and
felt
the
flesh
tremble
under
the
new
bark
he
embraced
the
branches
and
lavished
kisses
on
the
wood
the
branches
shrank
from
his
lips
since
you
can
not
be
my
wife
said
he
you
shall
assuredly
be
my
tree
i
will
wear
you
for
my
crown
i
will
decorate
with
you
my
harp
and
my
quiver
and
when
the
great
roman
conquerors
lead
up
the
triumphal
pomp
to
the
capitol
you
shall
be
woven
into
wreaths
for
their
brows
and
as
eternal
youth
is
mine
you
also
shall
be
always
green
and
your
leaf
know
no
decay
the
nymph
now
changed
into
a
laurel
tree
bowed
its
head
in
grateful
acknowledgment
that
apollo
should
be
the
god
both
of
music
and
poetry
will
not
appear
strange
but
that
medicine
should
also
be
assigned
to
his
province
may
the
poet
armstrong
himself
a
physician
thus
accounts
for
it
music
exalts
each
joy
allays
each
grief
expels
diseases
softens
every
pain
and
hence
the
wise
of
ancient
days
adored
one
power
of
physic
melody
and
song
the
story
of
apollo
and
daphne
is
often
alluded
to
by
the
poets
waller
applies
it
to
the
case
of
one
whose
amatory
verses
though
they
did
not
soften
the
heart
of
his
mistress
yet
won
for
the
poet
fame
yet
what
he
sung
in
his
immortal
strain
though
unsuccessful
was
not
sung
in
vain
all
but
the
nymph
that
should
redress
his
wrong
attend
his
passion
and
approve
his
song
like
phoebus
thus
acquiring
unsought
praise
he
caught
at
love
and
filled
his
arms
with
bays
the
following
stanza
from
shelley
adonais
alludes
to
early
quarrel
with
the
reviewers
the
herded
wolves
bold
only
to
pursue
the
obscene
ravens
clamorous
the
dead
the
vultures
to
the
conqueror
banner
true
who

where
desolation
first
has
fed
and

rain
contagion
how
they

they

they
go
pyramus
and
thisbe
pyramus
was
the
handsomest
youth
and
thisbe
the
fairest
maiden
in
all
babylonia
where
semiramis
reigned
their
parents
occupied
adjoining
houses
and
neighborhood
brought
the
young
people
together
and
acquaintance
ripened
into
love
they
would
gladly
have
married
but
their
parents
forbade
one
thing
however
they
could
not
forbid
that
love
should
glow
with
equal
ardor
in
the
bosoms
of
both
they
conversed
by
signs
and
glances
and
the
fire
burned
more
intensely
for
being
covered
up
in
the
wall
that
parted
the
two
houses
there
was
a
crack
caused
by
some
fault
in
the
structure
no
one
had
remarked
it
before
but
the
lovers
discovered
it
what
will
not
love
discover
it
afforded
a
passage
to
the
voice
and
tender
messages
used
to
pass
backward
and
forward
through
the
gap
as
they
stood
pyramus
on
this
side
thisbe
on
that
their
breaths
would
mingle
cruel
wall
they
said
why
do
you
keep
two
lovers
apart
but
we
will
not
be
ungrateful
we
owe
you
we
confess
the
privilege
of
transmitting
loving
words
to
willing
ears
such
words
they
uttered
on
different
sides
of
the
wall
and
when
night
came
and
they
must
say
farewell
they
pressed
their
lips
upon
the
wall
she
on
her
side
he
on
his
as
they
could
come
no
nearer
next
morning
when
aurora
had
put
out
the
stars
and
the
sun
had
melted
the
frost
from
the
grass
they
met
at
the
accustomed
spot
then
after
lamenting
their
hard
fate
they
agreed
that
next
night
when
all
was
still
they
would
slip
away
from
watchful
eyes
leave
their
dwellings
and
walk
out
into
the
fields
and
to
insure
a
meeting
repair
to
a
edifice
standing
without
the
city
bounds
called
the
tomb
of
ninus
and
that
the
one
who
came
first
should
await
the
other
at
the
foot
of
a
certain
tree
it
was
a
white
mulberry
tree
and
stood
near
a
cool
spring
all
was
agreed
on
and
they
waited
impatiently
for
the
sun
to
go
down
beneath
the
waters
and
night
to
rise
up
from
them
then
cautiously
thisbe
stole
forth
unobserved
by
the
family
her
head
covered
with
a
veil
made
her
way
to
the
monument
and
sat
down
under
the
tree
as
she
sat
alone
in
the
dim
light
of
the
evening
she
descried
a
lioness
her
jaws
reeking
with
recent
slaughter
approaching
the
fountain
to
slake
her
thirst
thisbe
fled
at
the
sight
and
sought
refuge
in
the
hollow
of
a
rock
as
she
fled
she
dropped
her
veil
the
lioness
after
drinking
at
the
spring
turned
to
retreat
to
the
woods
and
seeing
the
veil
on
the
ground
tossed
and
rent
it
with
her
bloody
mouth
pyramus
having
been
delayed
now
approached
the
place
of
meeting
he
saw
in
the
sand
the
footsteps
of
the
lion
and
the
color
fled
from
his
cheeks
at
the
sight
presently
he
found
the
veil
all
rent
and
bloody
o
hapless
girl
said
he
i
have
been
the
cause
of
thy
death
thou
more
worthy
of
life
than
i
hast
fallen
the
first
victim
i
will
follow
i
am
the
guilty
cause
in
tempting
thee
forth
to
a
place
of
such
peril
and
not
being
myself
on
the
spot
to
guard
thee
come
forth
ye
lions
from
the
rocks
and
tear
this
guilty
body
with
your
teeth
he
took
up
the
veil
carried
it
with
him
to
the
appointed
tree
and
covered
it
with
kisses
and
with
tears
my
blood
also
shall
stain
your
texture
said
he
and
drawing
his
sword
plunged
it
into
his
heart
the
blood
spurted
from
the
wound
and
tinged
the
white
mulberries
of
the
tree
all
red
and
sinking
into
the
earth
reached
the
roots
so
that
the
red
color
mounted
through
the
trunk
to
the
fruit
by
this
time
thisbe
still
trembling
with
fear
yet
wishing
not
to
disappoint
her
lover
stepped
cautiously
forth
looking
anxiously
for
the
youth
eager
to
tell
him
the
danger
she
had
escaped
when
she
came
to
the
spot
and
saw
the
changed
color
of
the
mulberries
she
doubted
whether
it
was
the
same
place
while
she
hesitated
she
saw
the
form
of
one
struggling
in
the
agonies
of
death
she
started
back
a
shudder
ran
through
her
frame
as
a
ripple
on
the
face
of
the
still
water
when
a
sudden
breeze
sweeps
over
it
but
as
soon
as
she
recognized
her
lover
she
screamed
and
beat
her
breast
embracing
the
lifeless
body
pouring
tears
into
its
wounds
and
imprinting
kisses
on
the
cold
lips
o
pyramus
she
cried
what
has
done
this
answer
me
pyramus
it
is
your
own
thisbe
that
speaks
hear
me
dearest
and
lift
that
drooping
head
at
the
name
of
thisbe
pyramus
opened
his
eyes
then
closed
them
again
she
saw
her
veil
stained
with
blood
and
the
scabbard
empty
of
its
sword
thy
own
hand
has
slain
thee
and
for
my
sake
she
said
i
too
can
be
brave
for
once
and
my
love
is
as
strong
as
thine
i
will
follow
thee
in
death
for
i
have
been
the
cause
and
death
which
alone
could
part
us
shall
not
prevent
my
joining
thee
and
ye
unhappy
parents
of
us
both
deny
us
not
our
united
request
as
love
and
death
have
joined
us
let
one
tomb
contain
us
and
thou
tree
retain
the
marks
of
slaughter
let
thy
berries
still
serve
for
memorials
of
our
blood
so
saying
she
plunged
the
sword
into
her
breast
her
parents
ratified
her
wish
the
gods
also
ratified
it
the
two
bodies
were
buried
in
one
sepulchre
and
the
tree
ever
after
brought
forth
purple
berries
as
it
does
to
this
day
moore
in
the

speaking
of

reminded
of
the

her

o

metallic

that

of
protecting

which

delicately
draws
around

sets

through
whose
small
holes
this
dangerous
pair
may
see
each

but
not

in
mickle
translation
of
the
lusiad
occurs
the
following
allusion
to
the
story
of
pyramus
and
thisbe
and
the
metamorphosis
of
the
mulberries
the
poet
is
describing
the
island
of
love
here
each
gift
pomona

bestows
in
cultured
garden
free
uncultured
flows
the
flavor
sweeter
and
the
hue
more
fair
than
was
fostered
by
the
hand
of
care
the
cherry
here
in
shining
crimson
glows
and
stained
with
lovers
blood
in
pendent
rows
the
mulberries
the
bending
boughs
if
any
of
our
young
readers
can
be
so
as
to
enjoy
a
laugh
at
the
expense
of
poor
pyramus
and
thisbe
they
may
find
an
opportunity
by
turning
to
shakspeare
play
of
the
midsummer
night
dream
where
it
is
most
amusingly
burlesqued
cephalus
and
procris
cephalus
was
a
beautiful
youth
and
fond
of
manly
sports
he
would
rise
before
the
dawn
to
pursue
the
chase
aurora
saw
him
when
she
first
looked
forth
fell
in
love
with
him
and
stole
him
away
but
cephalus
was
just
married
to
a
charming
wife
whom
he
devotedly
loved
her
name
was
procris
she
was
a
favorite
of
diana
the
goddess
of
hunting
who
had
given
her
a
dog
which
could
outrun
every
rival
and
a
javelin
which
would
never
fail
of
its
mark
and
procris
gave
these
presents
to
her
husband
cephalus
was
so
happy
in
his
wife
that
he
resisted
all
the
entreaties
of
aurora
and
she
finally
dismissed
him
in
displeasure
saying
go
ungrateful
mortal
keep
your
wife
whom
if
i
am
not
much
mistaken
you
will
one
day
be
very
sorry
you
ever
saw
again
cephalus
returned
and
was
as
happy
as
ever
in
his
wife
and
his
woodland
sports
now
it
happened
some
angry
deity
had
sent
a
ravenous
fox
to
annoy
the
country
and
the
hunters
turned
out
in
great
strength
to
capture
it
their
efforts
were
all
in
vain
no
dog
could
run
it
down
and
at
last
they
came
to
cephalus
to
borrow
his
famous
dog
whose
name
was
lelaps
no
sooner
was
the
dog
let
loose
than
he
darted
off
quicker
than
their
eye
could
follow
him
if
they
had
not
seen
his
footprints
in
the
sand
they
would
have
thought
he
flew
cephalus
and
others
stood
on
a
hill
and
saw
the
race
the
fox
tried
every
art
he
ran
in
a
circle
and
turned
on
his
track
the
dog
close
upon
him
with
open
jaws
snapping
at
his
heels
but
biting
only
the
air
cephalus
was
about
to
use
his
javelin
when
suddenly
he
saw
both
dog
and
game
stop
instantly
the
heavenly
powers
who
had
given
both
were
not
willing
that
either
should
conquer
in
the
very
attitude
of
life
and
action
they
were
turned
into
stone
so
lifelike
and
natural
did
they
look
you
would
have
thought
as
you
looked
at
them
that
one
was
going
to
bark
the
other
to
leap
forward
cephalus
though
he
had
lost
his
dog
still
continued
to
take
delight
in
the
chase
he
would
go
out
at
early
morning
ranging
the
woods
and
hills
unaccompanied
by
any
one
needing
no
help
for
his
javelin
was
a
sure
weapon
in
all
cases
fatigued
with
hunting
when
the
sun
got
high
he
would
seek
a
shady
nook
where
a
cool
stream
flowed
and
stretched
on
the
grass
with
his
garments
thrown
aside
would
enjoy
the
breeze
sometimes
he
would
say
aloud
come
sweet
breeze
come
and
fan
my
breast
come
and
allay
the
heat
that
burns
me
some
one
passing
by
one
day
heard
him
talking
in
this
way
to
the
air
and
foolishly
believing
that
he
was
talking
to
some
maiden
went
and
told
the
secret
to
procris
cephalus
wife
love
is
credulous
procris
at
the
sudden
shock
fainted
away
presently
recovering
she
said
it
can
not
be
true
i
will
not
believe
it
unless
i
myself
am
a
witness
to
it
so
she
waited
with
anxious
heart
till
the
next
morning
when
cephalus
went
to
hunt
as
usual
then
she
stole
out
after
him
and
concealed
herself
in
the
place
where
the
informer
directed
her
cephalus
came
as
he
was
wont
when
tired
with
sport
and
stretched
himself
on
the
green
bank
saying
come
sweet
breeze
come
and
fan
me
you
know
how
i
love
you
you
make
the
groves
and
my
solitary
rambles
delightful
he
was
running
on
in
this
way
when
he
heard
or
thought
he
heard
a
sound
as
of
a
sob
in
the
bushes
supposing
it
some
wild
animal
he
threw
his
javelin
at
the
spot
a
cry
from
his
beloved
procris
told
him
that
the
weapon
had
too
surely
met
its
mark
he
rushed
to
the
place
and
found
her
bleeding
and
with
sinking
strength
endeavoring
to
draw
forth
from
the
wound
the
javelin
her
own
gift
cephalus
raised
her
from
the
earth
strove
to
stanch
the
blood
and
called
her
to
revive
and
not
to
leave
him
miserable
to
reproach
himself
with
her
death
she
opened
her
feeble
eyes
and
forced
herself
to
utter
these
few
words
i
implore
you
if
you
have
ever
loved
me
if
i
have
ever
deserved
kindness
at
your
hands
my
husband
grant
me
this
last
request
do
not
marry
that
odious
breeze
this
disclosed
the
whole
mystery
but
alas
what
advantage
to
disclose
it
now
she
died
but
her
face
wore
a
calm
expression
and
she
looked
pityingly
and
forgivingly
on
her
husband
when
he
made
her
understand
the
truth
moore
in
his
legendary
ballads
has
one
on
cephalus
and
procris
beginning
thus
a
hunter
once
in
a
grove
reclined
to
shun
the
noon
bright
eye
and
oft
he
wooed
the
wandering
wind
to
cool
his
brow
with
its
sigh
while
mute
lay
even
the
wild
bee
hum
nor
breath
could
stir
the
aspen
hair
his
song
was
still
air
o
come
while
echo
answered
sweet
air
chapter
iv
juno
and
her
rivals
io
and
callisto
diana
and
actaeon
latona
and
the
rustics
juno
one
day
perceived
it
suddenly
grow
dark
and
immediately
suspected
that
her
husband
had
raised
a
cloud
to
hide
some
of
his
doings
that
would
not
bear
the
light
she
brushed
away
the
cloud
and
saw
her
husband
on
the
banks
of
a
glassy
river
with
a
beautiful
heifer
standing
near
him
juno
suspected
the
form
concealed
some
fair
nymph
of
mortal
mould
as
was
indeed
the
case
for
it
was
io
the
daughter
of
the
river
god
inachus
whom
jupiter
had
been
flirting
with
and
when
he
became
aware
of
the
approach
of
his
wife
had
changed
into
that
form
juno
joined
her
husband
and
noticing
the
heifer
praised
its
beauty
and
asked
whose
it
was
and
of
what
herd
jupiter
to
stop
questions
replied
that
it
was
a
fresh
creation
from
the
earth
juno
asked
to
have
it
as
a
gift
what
could
jupiter
do
he
was
loath
to
give
his
mistress
to
his
wife
yet
how
refuse
so
trifling
a
present
as
a
simple
heifer
he
could
not
without
exciting
suspicion
so
he
consented
the
goddess
was
not
yet
relieved
of
her
suspicions
so
she
delivered
the
heifer
to
argus
to
be
strictly
watched
now
argus
had
a
hundred
eyes
in
his
head
and
never
went
to
sleep
with
more
than
two
at
a
time
so
that
he
kept
watch
of
io
constantly
he
suffered
her
to
feed
through
the
day
and
at
night
tied
her
up
with
a
vile
rope
round
her
neck
she
would
have
stretched
out
her
arms
to
implore
freedom
of
argus
but
she
had
no
arms
to
stretch
out
and
her
voice
was
a
bellow
that
frightened
even
herself
she
saw
her
father
and
her
sisters
went
near
them
and
suffered
them
to
pat
her
back
and
heard
them
admire
her
beauty
her
father
reached
her
a
tuft
of
grass
and
she
licked
the
outstretched
hand
she
longed
to
make
herself
known
to
him
and
would
have
uttered
her
wish
but
alas
words
were
wanting
at
length
she
bethought
herself
of
writing
and
inscribed
her
name
it
was
a
short
one
with
her
hoof
on
the
sand
inachus
recognized
it
and
discovering
that
his
daughter
whom
he
had
long
sought
in
vain
was
hidden
under
this
disguise
mourned
over
her
and
embracing
her
white
neck
exclaimed
alas
my
daughter
it
would
have
been
a
less
grief
to
have
lost
you
altogether
while
he
thus
lamented
argus
observing
came
and
drove
her
away
and
took
his
seat
on
a
high
bank
from
whence
he
could
see
all
around
in
every
direction
jupiter
was
troubled
at
beholding
the
sufferings
of
his
mistress
and
calling
mercury
told
him
to
go
and
despatch
argus
mercury
made
haste
put
his
winged
slippers
on
his
feet
and
cap
on
his
head
took
his
wand
and
leaped
down
from
the
heavenly
towers
to
the
earth
there
he
laid
aside
his
wings
and
kept
only
his
wand
with
which
he
presented
himself
as
a
shepherd
driving
his
flock
as
he
strolled
on
he
blew
upon
his
pipes
these
were
what
are
called
the
syrinx
or
pandean
pipes
argus
listened
with
delight
for
he
had
never
seen
the
instrument
before
young
man
said
he
come
and
take
a
seat
by
me
on
this
stone
there
is
no
better
place
for
your
flocks
to
graze
in
than
hereabouts
and
here
is
a
pleasant
shade
such
as
shepherds
love
mercury
sat
down
talked
and
told
stories
till
it
grew
late
and
played
upon
his
pipes
his
most
soothing
strains
hoping
to
lull
the
watchful
eyes
to
sleep
but
all
in
vain
for
argus
still
contrived
to
keep
some
of
his
eyes
open
though
he
shut
the
rest
among
other
stories
mercury
told
him
how
the
instrument
on
which
he
played
was
invented
there
was
a
certain
nymph
whose
name
was
syrinx
who
was
much
beloved
by
the
satyrs
and
spirits
of
the
wood
but
she
would
have
none
of
them
but
was
a
faithful
worshipper
of
diana
and
followed
the
chase
you
would
have
thought
it
was
diana
herself
had
you
seen
her
in
her
hunting
dress
only
that
her
bow
was
of
horn
and
diana
of
silver
one
day
as
she
was
returning
from
the
chase
pan
met
her
told
her
just
this
and
added
more
of
the
same
sort
she
ran
away
without
stopping
to
hear
his
compliments
and
he
pursued
till
she
came
to
the
bank
of
the
river
where
he
overtook
her
and
she
had
only
time
to
call
for
help
on
her
friends
the
water
nymphs
they
heard
and
consented
pan
threw
his
arms
around
what
he
supposed
to
be
the
form
of
the
nymph
and
found
he
embraced
only
a
tuft
of
reeds
as
he
breathed
a
sigh
the
air
sounded
through
the
reeds
and
produced
a
plaintive
melody
the
god
charmed
with
the
novelty
and
with
the
sweetness
of
the
music
said
then
at
least
you
shall
be
mine
and
he
took
some
of
the
reeds
and
placing
them
together
of
unequal
lengths
side
by
side
made
an
instrument
which
he
called
syrinx
in
honor
of
the
nymph
before
mercury
had
finished
his
story
he
saw
argus
eyes
all
asleep
as
his
head
nodded
forward
on
his
breast
mercury
with
one
stroke
cut
his
neck
through
and
tumbled
his
head
down
the
rocks
o
hapless
argus
the
light
of
your
hundred
eyes
is
quenched
at
once
juno
took
them
and
put
them
as
ornaments
on
the
tail
of
her
peacock
where
they
remain
to
this
day
but
the
vengeance
of
juno
was
not
yet
satiated
she
sent
a
gadfly
to
torment
io
who
fled
over
the
whole
world
from
its
pursuit
she
swam
through
the
ionian
sea
which
derived
its
name
from
her
then
roamed
over
the
plains
of
illyria
ascended
mount
haemus
and
crossed
the
thracian
strait
thence
named
the
bosphorus
ford
rambled
on
through
scythia
and
the
country
of
the
cimmerians
and
arrived
at
last
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
at
length
jupiter
interceded
for
her
and
upon
his
promising
not
to
pay
her
any
more
attentions
juno
consented
to
restore
her
to
her
form
it
was
curious
to
see
her
gradually
recover
her
former
self
the
coarse
hairs
fell
from
her
body
her
horns
shrank
up
her
eyes
grew
narrower
her
mouth
shorter
hands
and
fingers
came
instead
of
hoofs
to
her
forefeet
in
fine
there
was
nothing
left
of
the
heifer
except
her
beauty
at
first
she
was
afraid
to
speak
for
fear
she
should
low
but
gradually
she
recovered
her
confidence
and
was
restored
to
her
father
and
sisters
in
a
poem
dedicated
to
leigh
hunt
by
keats
the
following
allusion
to
the
story
of
pan
and
syrinx
occurs
so
did
he
feel
who
pulled
the
bough
aside
that
we
might
look
into
a
forest
wide
telling
us
how
fair
trembling
syrinx
fled
arcadian
pan
with
such
a
fearful
dread
poor
nymph
poor
pan
how
he
did
weep
to
find
nought
but
a
lovely
sighing
of
the
wind
along
the
reedy
stream
a
strain
full
of
sweet
desolation
balmy
pain
callisto
callisto
was
another
maiden
who
excited
the
jealousy
of
juno
and
the
goddess
changed
her
into
a
bear
i
will
take
away
said
she
that
beauty
with
which
you
have
captivated
my
husband
down
fell
callisto
on
her
hands
and
knees
she
tried
to
stretch
out
her
arms
in
supplication
they
were
already
beginning
to
be
covered
with
black
hair
her
hands
grew
rounded
became
armed
with
crooked
claws
and
served
for
feet
her
mouth
which
jove
used
to
praise
for
its
beauty
became
a
horrid
pair
of
jaws
her
voice
which
if
unchanged
would
have
moved
the
heart
to
pity
became
a
growl
more
fit
to
inspire
terror
yet
her
former
disposition
remained
and
with
continual
groaning
she
bemoaned
her
fate
and
stood
upright
as
well
as
she
could
lifting
up
her
paws
to
beg
for
mercy
and
felt
that
jove
was
unkind
though
she
could
not
tell
him
so
ah
how
often
afraid
to
stay
in
the
woods
all
night
alone
she
wandered
about
the
neighborhood
of
her
former
haunts
how
often
frightened
by
the
dogs
did
she
so
lately
a
huntress
fly
in
terror
from
the
hunters
often
she
fled
from
the
wild
beasts
forgetting
that
she
was
now
a
wild
beast
herself
and
bear
as
she
was
was
afraid
of
the
bears
one
day
a
youth
espied
her
as
he
was
hunting
she
saw
him
and
recognized
him
as
her
own
son
now
grown
a
young
man
she
stopped
and
felt
inclined
to
embrace
him
as
she
was
about
to
approach
he
alarmed
raised
his
hunting
spear
and
was
on
the
point
of
transfixing
her
when
jupiter
beholding
arrested
the
crime
and
snatching
away
both
of
them
placed
them
in
the
heavens
as
the
great
and
little
bear
juno
was
in
a
rage
to
see
her
rival
so
set
in
honor
and
hastened
to
ancient
tethys
and
oceanus
the
powers
of
ocean
and
in
answer
to
their
inquiries
thus
told
the
cause
of
her
coming
do
you
ask
why
i
the
queen
of
the
gods
have
left
the
heavenly
plains
and
sought
your
depths
learn
that
i
am
supplanted
in
heaven
my
place
is
given
to
another
you
will
hardly
believe
me
but
look
when
night
darkens
the
world
and
you
shall
see
the
two
of
whom
i
have
so
much
reason
to
complain
exalted
to
the
heavens
in
that
part
where
the
circle
is
the
smallest
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
pole
why
should
any
one
hereafter
tremble
at
the
thought
of
offending
juno
when
such
rewards
are
the
consequence
of
my
displeasure
see
what
i
have
been
able
to
effect
i
forbade
her
to
wear
the
human
form
she
is
placed
among
the
stars
so
do
my
punishments
result
such
is
the
extent
of
my
power
better
that
she
should
have
resumed
her
former
shape
as
i
permitted
io
to
do
perhaps
he
means
to
marry
her
and
put
me
away
but
you
my
if
you
feel
for
me
and
see
with
displeasure
this
unworthy
treatment
of
me
show
it
i
beseech
you
by
forbidding
this
guilty
couple
from
coming
into
your
waters
the
powers
of
the
ocean
assented
and
consequently
the
two
constellations
of
the
great
and
little
bear
move
round
and
round
in
heaven
but
never
sink
as
the
other
stars
do
beneath
the
ocean
milton
alludes
to
the
fact
that
the
constellation
of
the
bear
never
sets
when
he
says
let
my
lamp
at
midnight
hour
be
seen
in
some
high
lonely
tower
where
i
may
oft
outwatch
the
bear
etc
and
prometheus
in
lowell
poem
says
one
after
one
the
stars
have
risen
and
set
sparkling
upon
the
hoar
frost
of
my
chain
the
bear
that
prowled
all
night
about
the
fold
of
the
hath
shrunk
into
his
den
scared
by
the
blithesome
footsteps
of
the
dawn
the
last
star
in
the
tail
of
the
little
bear
is
the
called
also
the
cynosure
milton
says
straight
mine
eye
hath
caught
new
pleasures
while
the
landscape
round
it
measures
towers
and
battlements
it
sees
bosomed
high
in
tufted
trees
where
perhaps
some
beauty
lies
the
cynosure
of
neighboring
eyes
the
reference
here
is
both
to
the
as
the
guide
of
mariners
and
to
the
magnetic
attraction
of
the
north
he
calls
it
also
the
star
of
arcady
because
callisto
boy
was
named
arcas
and
they
lived
in
arcadia
in
comus
the
brother
benighted
in
the
woods
says
some
gentle
taper
though
a
rush
candle
from
the
wicker
hole
of
some
clay
habitation
visit
us
with
thy
long
levelled
rule
of
streaming
light
and
thou
shalt
be
our
star
of
arcady
or
tyrian
cynosure
diana
and
actaeon
thus
in
two
instances
we
have
seen
juno
severity
to
her
rivals
now
let
us
learn
how
a
virgin
goddess
punished
an
invader
of
her
privacy
it
was
midday
and
the
sun
stood
equally
distant
from
either
goal
when
young
actaeon
son
of
king
cadmus
thus
addressed
the
youths
who
with
him
were
hunting
the
stag
in
the
mountains
friends
our
nets
and
our
weapons
are
wet
with
the
blood
of
our
victims
we
have
had
sport
enough
for
one
day
and
we
can
renew
our
labors
now
while
phoebus
parches
the
earth
let
us
put
by
our
implements
and
indulge
ourselves
with
rest
there
was
a
valley
thick
enclosed
with
cypresses
and
pines
sacred
to
the
huntress
queen
diana
in
the
extremity
of
the
valley
was
a
cave
not
adorned
with
art
but
nature
had
counterfeited
art
in
its
construction
for
she
had
turned
the
arch
of
its
roof
with
stones
as
delicately
fitted
as
if
by
the
hand
of
man
a
fountain
burst
out
from
one
side
whose
open
basin
was
bounded
by
a
grassy
rim
here
the
goddess
of
the
woods
used
to
come
when
weary
with
hunting
and
lave
her
virgin
limbs
in
the
sparkling
water
one
day
having
repaired
thither
with
her
nymphs
she
handed
her
javelin
her
quiver
and
her
bow
to
one
her
robe
to
another
while
a
third
unbound
the
sandals
from
her
feet
then
crocale
the
most
skilful
of
them
arranged
her
hair
and
nephele
hyale
and
the
rest
drew
water
in
capacious
urns
while
the
goddess
was
thus
employed
in
the
labors
of
the
toilet
behold
actaeon
having
quitted
his
companions
and
rambling
without
any
especial
object
came
to
the
place
led
thither
by
his
destiny
as
he
presented
himself
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
the
nymphs
seeing
a
man
screamed
and
rushed
towards
the
goddess
to
hide
her
with
their
bodies
but
she
was
taller
than
the
rest
and
overtopped
them
all
by
a
head
such
a
color
as
tinges
the
clouds
at
sunset
or
at
dawn
came
over
the
countenance
of
diana
thus
taken
by
surprise
surrounded
as
she
was
by
her
nymphs
she
yet
turned
half
away
and
sought
with
a
sudden
impulse
for
her
arrows
as
they
were
not
at
hand
she
dashed
the
water
into
the
face
of
the
intruder
adding
these
words
now
go
and
tell
if
you
can
that
you
have
seen
diana
unapparelled
immediately
a
pair
of
branching
stag
horns
grew
out
of
his
head
his
neck
gained
in
length
his
ears
grew
his
hands
became
feet
his
arms
long
legs
his
body
was
covered
with
a
hairy
spotted
hide
fear
took
the
place
of
his
former
boldness
and
the
hero
fled
he
could
not
but
admire
his
own
speed
but
when
he
saw
his
horns
in
the
water
ah
wretched
me
he
would
have
said
but
no
sound
followed
the
effort
he
groaned
and
tears
flowed
down
the
face
which
had
taken
the
place
of
his
own
yet
his
consciousness
remained
what
shall
he
do
go
home
to
seek
the
palace
or
lie
hid
in
the
woods
the
latter
he
was
afraid
the
former
he
was
ashamed
to
do
while
he
hesitated
the
dogs
saw
him
first
melampus
a
spartan
dog
gave
the
signal
with
his
bark
then
pamphagus
dorceus
lelaps
theron
nape
tigris
and
all
the
rest
rushed
after
him
swifter
than
the
wind
over
rocks
and
cliffs
through
mountain
gorges
that
seemed
impracticable
he
fled
and
they
followed
where
he
had
often
chased
the
stag
and
cheered
on
his
pack
his
pack
now
chased
him
cheered
on
by
his
huntsmen
he
longed
to
cry
out
i
am
actaeon
recognize
your
master
but
the
words
came
not
at
his
will
the
air
resounded
with
the
bark
of
the
dogs
presently
one
fastened
on
his
back
another
seized
his
shoulder
while
they
held
their
master
the
rest
of
the
pack
came
up
and
buried
their
teeth
in
his
flesh
he
groaned
not
in
a
human
voice
yet
certainly
not
in
a
stag
and
falling
on
his
knees
raised
his
eyes
and
would
have
raised
his
arms
in
supplication
if
he
had
had
them
his
friends
and
cheered
on
the
dogs
and
looked
everywhere
for
actaeon
calling
on
him
to
join
the
sport
at
the
sound
of
his
name
he
turned
his
head
and
heard
them
regret
that
he
should
be
away
he
earnestly
wished
he
was
he
would
have
been
well
pleased
to
see
the
exploits
of
his
dogs
but
to
feel
them
was
too
much
they
were
all
around
him
rending
and
tearing
and
it
was
not
till
they
had
torn
his
life
out
that
the
anger
of
diana
was
satisfied
in
shelley
poem
adonais
is
the
following
allusion
to
the
story
of
actaeon
others
of
less
note
came
one
frail
form
a
phantom
among
men
companionless
as
the
last
cloud
of
an
expiring
storm
whose
thunder
is
its
knell
he
as
i
guess
had
gazed
on
nature
naked
loveliness
and
now
he
fled
astray
with
feeble
steps
the
world
wilderness
and
his
own
thoughts
along
that
rugged
way
pursued
like
raging
hounds
their
father
and
their
prey
stanza
the
allusion
is
probably
to
shelley
himself
latona
and
the
rustics
some
thought
the
goddess
in
this
instance
more
severe
than
was
just
while
others
praised
her
conduct
as
strictly
consistent
with
her
virgin
dignity
as
usual
the
recent
event
brought
older
ones
to
mind
and
one
of
the
bystanders
told
this
story
some
countrymen
of
lycia
once
insulted
the
goddess
latona
but
not
with
impunity
when
i
was
young
my
father
who
had
grown
too
old
for
active
labors
sent
me
to
lycia
to
drive
thence
some
choice
oxen
and
there
i
saw
the
very
pond
and
marsh
where
the
wonder
happened
near
by
stood
an
ancient
altar
black
with
the
smoke
of
sacrifice
and
almost
buried
among
the
reeds
i
inquired
whose
altar
it
might
be
whether
of
faunus
or
the
naiads
or
some
god
of
the
neighboring
mountain
and
one
of
the
country
people
replied
mountain
or
river
god
possesses
this
altar
but
she
whom
royal
juno
in
her
jealousy
drove
from
land
to
land
denying
her
any
spot
of
earth
whereon
to
rear
her
twins
bearing
in
her
arms
the
infant
deities
latona
reached
this
land
weary
with
her
burden
and
parched
with
thirst
by
chance
she
espied
on
the
bottom
of
the
valley
this
pond
of
clear
water
where
the
country
people
were
at
work
gathering
willows
and
osiers
the
goddess
approached
and
kneeling
on
the
bank
would
have
slaked
her
thirst
in
the
cool
stream
but
the
rustics
forbade
her
do
you
refuse
me
water
said
she
is
free
to
all
nature
allows
no
one
to
claim
as
property
the
sunshine
the
air
or
the
water
i
come
to
take
my
share
of
the
common
blessing
yet
i
ask
it
of
you
as
a
favor
i
have
no
intention
of
washing
my
limbs
in
it
weary
though
they
be
but
only
to
quench
my
thirst
my
mouth
is
so
dry
that
i
can
hardly
speak
a
draught
of
water
would
be
nectar
to
me
it
would
revive
me
and
i
would
own
myself
indebted
to
you
for
life
itself
let
these
infants
move
your
pity
who
stretch
out
their
little
arms
as
if
to
plead
for
me
and
the
children
as
it
happened
were
stretching
out
their
arms
who
would
not
have
been
moved
with
these
gentle
words
of
the
goddess
but
these
clowns
persisted
in
their
rudeness
they
even
added
jeers
and
threats
of
violence
if
she
did
not
leave
the
place
nor
was
this
all
they
waded
into
the
pond
and
stirred
up
the
mud
with
their
feet
so
as
to
make
the
water
unfit
to
drink
latona
was
so
angry
that
she
ceased
to
mind
her
thirst
she
no
longer
supplicated
the
clowns
but
lifting
her
hands
to
heaven
exclaimed
they
never
quit
that
pool
but
pass
their
lives
there
and
it
came
to
pass
accordingly
they
now
live
in
the
water
sometimes
totally
submerged
then
raising
their
heads
above
the
surface
or
swimming
upon
it
sometimes
they
come
out
upon
the
bank
but
soon
leap
back
again
into

you
may

ask

he
continued
look
round
the
world
and
choose
whatever
you
will
of
what
earth
or

contains
most
precious
ask
it
and
fear
no
refusal
this
only
i
pray
you
not
to
urge
it
is
not
honor

destruction
you
seek
why
do
you
hang
round
my

still
entreat
me
you
shall
have
it
if
you
persist
the
oath
is
sworn
and
must
be
kept
but
i
beg
you
to
choose
more
wisely
he
ended
but
the
youth
rejected
all
admonition
and
held
to
his
demand
so
having
resisted
as
long
as
he
could
phoebus
at
last
led
the
way
to
where
stood
the
lofty
chariot
it
was
of
gold
the
gift
of
vulcan
the
axle
was
of
gold
the
pole
and
wheels
of
gold
the
spokes
of
silver
along
the
seat
were
rows
of
chrysolites
and
diamonds
which
reflected
all
around
the
brightness
of
the
sun
while
the
daring
youth
gazed
in
admiration
the
early
dawn
threw
open
the
purple
doors
of
the
east
and
showed
the
pathway
strewn
with
roses
the
stars
withdrew
marshalled
by
the
which
last
of
all
retired
also
the
father
when
he
saw
the
earth
beginning
to
glow
and
the
moon
preparing
to
retire
ordered
the
hours
to
harness
up
the
horses
they
obeyed
and
led
forth
from
the
lofty
stalls
the
steeds
full
fed
with
ambrosia
and
attached
the
reins
then
the
father
bathed
the
face
of
his
son
with
a
powerful
unguent
and
made
him
capable
of
enduring
the
brightness
of
the
flame
he
set
the
rays
on
his
head
and
with
a
foreboding
sigh
said
if
my
son
you
will
in
this
at
least
heed
my
advice
spare
the
whip
and
hold
tight
the
reins
they
go
fast
enough
of
their
own
accord
the
labor
is
to
hold
them
in
you
are
not
to
take
the
straight
road
directly
between
the
five
circles
but
turn
off
to
the
left
keep
within
the
limit
of
the
middle
zone
and
avoid
the
northern
and
the
southern
alike
you
will
see
the
marks
of
the
wheels
and
they
will
serve
to
guide
you
and
that
the
skies
and
the
earth
may
each
receive
their
due
share
of
heat
go
not
too
high
or
you
will
burn
the
heavenly
dwellings
nor
too
low
or
you
will
set
the
earth
on
fire
the
middle
course
is
safest
and
best

night

agile
youth
sprang
into

the

out

outrun

breezes
which
started
from
the

eastern
goal
the
steeds
soon
perceived
that
the
load
they
drew
was
lighter
than
usual
and
as
a
ship
without
ballast
is
tossed
hither
and
thither
on
the

the
chariot
without
its
accustomed
weight
was
dashed
about

plunged
into

the

coiled
up

warm

felt
its
rage
revive

they

fled
away

encumbered
with

grew
pale

with
terror

himself

he
loses
his

to

whether
to
draw
tight
the

loose
he
forgets

midas
baucis
and
philemon
bacchus
on
a
certain
occasion
found
his
old
schoolmaster
and
silenus
missing
the
old
man
had
been
drinking
and
in
that
state
wandered
away
and
was
found
by
some
peasants
who
carried
him
to
their
king
midas
midas
recognized
him
and
treated
him
hospitably
entertaining
him
for
ten
days
and
nights
with
an
unceasing
round
of
jollity
on
the
eleventh
day
he
brought
silenus
back
and
restored
him
in
safety
to
his
pupil
whereupon
bacchus
offered
midas
his
choice
of
a
reward
whatever
he
might
wish
he
asked
that
whatever
he
might
touch
should
be
changed
into
gold
bacchus
consented
though
sorry
that
he
had
not
made
a
better
choice
midas
went
his
way
rejoicing
in
his
power
which
he
hastened
to
put
to
the
test
he
could
scarce
believe
his
eyes
when
he
found
a
twig
of
an
oak
which
he
plucked
from
the
branch
become
gold
in
his
hand
he
took
up
a
stone
it
changed
to
gold
he
touched
a
sod
it
did
the
same
he
took
an
apple
from
the
tree
you
would
have
thought
he
had
robbed
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
his
joy
knew
no
bounds
and
as
soon
as
he
got
home
he
ordered
the
servants
to
set
a
splendid
repast
on
the
table
then
he
found
to
his
dismay
that
whether
he
touched
bread
it
hardened
in
his
hand
or
put
a
morsel
to
his
lips
it
defied
his
teeth
he
took
a
glass
of
wine
but
it
flowed
down
his
throat
like
melted
gold
in
consternation
at
the
unprecedented
affliction
he
strove
to
divest
himself
of
his
power
he
hated
the
gift
he
had
lately
coveted
but
all
in
vain
starvation
seemed
to
await
him
he
raised
his
arms
all
shining
with
gold
in
prayer
to
bacchus
begging
to
be
delivered
from
his
glittering
destruction
bacchus
merciful
deity
heard
and
consented
go
said
he
to
the
river
pactolus
trace
the
stream
to
its
there
plunge
your
head
and
body
in
and
wash
away
your
fault
and
its
punishment
he
did
so
and
scarce
had
he
touched
the
waters
before
the
creating
power
passed
into
them
and
the
became
changed
into
gold
as
they
remain
to
this
day
thenceforth
midas
hating
wealth
and
splendor
dwelt
in
the
country
and
became
a
worshipper
of
pan
the
god
of
the
fields
on
a
certain
occasion
pan
had
the
temerity
to
compare
his
music
with
that
of
apollo
and
to
challenge
the
god
of
the
lyre
to
a
trial
of
skill
the
challenge
was
accepted
and
tmolus
the
mountain
god
was
chosen
umpire
the
senior
took
his
seat
and
cleared
away
the
trees
from
his
ears
to
listen
at
a
given
signal
pan
blew
on
his
pipes
and
with
his
rustic
melody
gave
great
satisfaction
to
himself
and
his
faithful
follower
midas
who
happened
to
be
present
then
tmolus
turned
his
head
toward
the
and
all
his
trees
turned
with
him
apollo
rose
his
brow
wreathed
with
parnassian
laurel
while
his
robe
of
tyrian
purple
swept
the
ground
in
his
left
hand
he
held
the
lyre
and
with
his
right
hand
struck
the
strings
ravished
with
the
harmony
tmolus
at
once
awarded
the
victory
to
the
god
of
the
lyre
and
all
but
midas
acquiesced
in
the
judgment
he
dissented
and
questioned
the
justice
of
the
award
apollo
would
not
suffer
such
a
depraved
pair
of
ears
any
longer
to
wear
the
human
form
but
caused
them
to
increase
in
length
grow
hairy
within
and
without
and
movable
on
their
roots
in
short
to
be
on
the
perfect
pattern
of
those
of
an
ass
mortified
enough
was
king
midas
at
this
mishap
but
he
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
it
was
possible
to
hide
his
misfortune
which
he
attempted
to
do
by
means
of
an
ample
turban
or
but
his
of
course
knew
the
secret
he
was
charged
not
to
mention
it
and
threatened
with
dire
punishment
if
he
presumed
to
disobey
but
he
found
it
too
much
for
his
discretion
to
keep
such
a
secret
so
he
went
out
into
the
meadow
dug
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
stooping
down
whispered
the
story
and
covered
it
up
before
long
a
thick
bed
of
reeds
sprang
up
in
the
meadow
and
as
soon
as
it
had
gained
its
growth
began
whispering
the
story
and
has
continued
to
do
so
from
that
day
to
this
every
time
a
breeze
passes
over
the
place
the
story
of
king
midas
has
been
told
by
others
with
some
variations
dryden
in
the
wife
of
bath
tale
makes
queen
the
betrayer
of
the
secret
this
midas
knew
and
durst
communicate
to
none
but
to
his
wife
his
ears
of
state
midas
was
king
of
phrygia
he
was
the
son
of
gordius
a
poor
countryman
who
was
taken
by
the
people
and
made
king
in
obedience
to
the
command
of
the
oracle
which
had
said
that
their
future
king
should
come
in
a
wagon
while
the
people
were
deliberating
gordius
with
his
wife
and
son
came
driving
his
wagon
into
the
public
square
gordius
being
made
king
dedicated
his
wagon
to
the
deity
of
the
oracle
and
tied
it
up
in
its
place
with
a
fast
knot
this
was
the
celebrated
gordian
knot
which
in
after
times
it
was
said
whoever
should
untie
should
become
lord
of
all
asia
many
tried
to
untie
it
but
none
succeeded
till
alexander
the
great
in
his
career
of
conquest
came
to
phrygia
he
tried
his
skill
with
as
ill
success
as
others
till
growing
impatient
he
drew
his
sword
and
cut
the
knot
when
he
afterwards
succeeded
in
subjecting
all
asia
to
his
sway
people
began
to
think
that
he
had
complied
with
the
terms
of
the
oracle

to
its
true
meaning

without

presented
themselves
as
weary
travellers
at
many
a
door
seeking
rest
and
shelter
but
found
all
closed
for
it
was
late
and
the
inhospitable
inhabitants
would
not
rouse
themselves
to
open
for
their
reception
at
last
a
humble
mansion
received
them
a
small
thatched
cottage
where
baucis
a
pious
old
dame
and
her
husband
philemon
united
when
young
had
grown
old
together
not
ashamed
of
their
poverty
they
made
it
endurable
by
moderate
desires
and
kind
dispositions
one
need
not
look
there
for
master
or
for
servant
they
two
were
the
whole
household
master
and
servant
alike
when
the
two
heavenly
guests
crossed
the
humble
threshold
and
bowed
their
heads
to
pass
under
the
low
door
the
old
man
placed
a
seat
on
which
baucis
bustling
and
attentive
spread
a
cloth
and
begged
them
to
sit
down
then
she
raked
out
the
coals
from
the
ashes
and
kindled
up
a
fire
fed
it
with
leaves
and
dry
bark
and
with
her
scanty
breath
blew
it
into
a
flame
she
brought
out
of
a
corner
split
sticks
and
dry
branches
broke
them
up
and
placed
them
under
the
small
kettle
her
husband
collected
some
in
the
garden
and
she
shred
them
from
the
stalks
and
prepared
them
for
the
pot
he
reached
down
with
a
forked
stick
a
flitch
of
bacon
hanging
in
the
chimney
cut
a
small
piece
and
put
it
in
the
pot
to
boil
with
the
herbs
setting
away
the
rest
for
another
time
a
beechen
bowl
was
filled
with
warm
water
that
their
guests
might
wash
while
all
was
doing
they
beguiled
the
time
with
conversation
on
the
bench
designed
for
the
guests
was
laid
a
cushion
stuffed
with
and
a
cloth
only
produced
on
great
occasions
but
ancient
and
coarse
enough
was
spread
over
that
the
old
lady
with
her
apron
on
with
trembling
hand
set
the
table
one
leg
was
shorter
than
the
rest
but
a
piece
of
slate
put
under
restored
the
level
when
fixed
she
rubbed
the
table
down
with
some
smelling
herbs
upon
it
she
set
some
of
chaste
minerva
olives
some
cornel
berries
preserved
in
vinegar
and
added
radishes
and
cheese
with
eggs
lightly
cooked
in
the
ashes
all
were
served
in
earthen
dishes
and
an
earthenware
pitcher
with
wooden
cups
stood
beside
them
when
all
was
ready
the
stew
smoking
hot
was
set
on
the
table
some
wine
not
of
the
oldest
was
added
and
for
dessert
apples
and
wild
honey
and
over
and
above
all
friendly
faces
and
simple
but
hearty
welcome
now
while
the
repast
proceeded
the
old
folks
were
astonished
to
see
that
the
wine
as
fast
as
it
was
poured
out
renewed
itself
in
the
pitcher
of
its
own
accord
struck
with
terror
baucis
and
philemon
recognized
their
heavenly
guests
fell
on
their
knees
and
with
clasped
hands
implored
forgiveness
for
their
poor
entertainment
there
was
an
old
goose
which
they
kept
as
the
guardian
of
their
humble
cottage
and
they
bethought
them
to
make
this
a
sacrifice
in
honor
of
their
guests
but
the
goose
too
nimble
with
the
aid
of
feet
and
wings
for
the
old
folks
eluded
their
pursuit
and
at
last
took
shelter
between
the
gods
themselves
they
forbade
it
to
be
slain
and
spoke
in
these
words
we
are
gods
this
inhospitable
village
shall
pay
the
penalty
of
its
impiety
you
alone
shall
go
free
from
the
chastisement
quit
your
house
and
come
with
us
to
the
top
of
yonder
hill
they
hastened
to
obey
and
staff
in
hand
labored
up
the
steep
ascent
they
had
reached
to
within
an
arrow
flight
of
the
top
when
turning
their
eyes
below
they
beheld
all
the
country
sunk
in
a
lake
only
their
own
house
left
standing
while
they
gazed
with
wonder
at
the
sight
and
lamented
the
fate
of
their
neighbors
that
old
house
of
theirs
was
changed
into
a
temple
columns
took
the
place
of
the
corner
posts
the
thatch
grew
yellow
and
appeared
a
gilded
roof
the
floors
became
marble
the
doors
were
enriched
with
carving
and
ornaments
of
gold
then
spoke
jupiter
in
benignant
accents
excellent
old
man
and
woman
worthy
of
such
a
husband
speak
tell
us
your
wishes
what
favor
have
you
to
ask
of
us
philemon
took
counsel
with
baucis
a
few
moments
then
declared
to
the
gods
their
united
wish
we
ask
to
be
priests
and
guardians
of
this
your
temple
and
since
here
we
have
passed
our
lives
in
love
and
concord
we
wish
that
one
and
the
same
hour
may
take
us
both
from
life
that
i
may
not
live
to
see
her
grave
nor
be
laid
in
my
own
by
her
their
prayer
was
granted
they
were
the
keepers
of
the
temple
as
long
as
they
lived
when
grown
very
old
as
they
stood
one
day
before
the
steps
of
the
sacred
edifice
and
were
telling
the
story
of
the
place
baucis
saw
philemon
begin
to
put
forth
leaves
and
old
philemon
saw
baucis
changing
in
like
manner
and
now
a
leafy
crown
had
grown
over
their
heads
while
exchanging
parting
words
as
long
as
they
could
speak
farewell
dear
spouse
they
said
together
and
at
the
same
moment
the
bark
closed
over
their
mouths
the
tyanean
shepherd
still
shows
the
two
trees
standing
side
by
side
made
out
of
the
two
good
old
people
the
story
of
baucis
and
philemon
has
been
imitated
by
swift
in
a
burlesque
style
the
actors
in
the
change
being
two
wandering
saints
and
the
house
being
changed
into
a
church
of
which
philemon
is
made
the
parson
the
following
may
serve
as
a
specimen
they
scarce
had
spoke
when
fair
and
soft
the
roof
began
to
mount
aloft
aloft
rose
every
beam
and
rafter
the
heavy
wall
climbed
slowly
after
the
chimney
widened
and
grew
higher
became
a
steeple
with
a
spire
the
kettle
to
the
top
was
hoist
and
there
stood
fastened
to
a
joist
but
with
the
upside
down
to
show
its
inclination
for

in
vain
for
a
superior
force
applied
at
bottom
stops
its
course
doomed
ever
in
suspense
to
dwell
is
now
no
kettle
but
a
bell
a
wooden
jack
which
had
almost
lost
by
disuse
the
art
to
roast
a
sudden
alteration
feels
increased
by
new
intestine
wheels
and
what
exalts
the
wonder
more
the
number
made
the

the

feet

you

inch
an

the
jack
and
chimney
near

had
never
left

other
side
the
chimney
to
a
steeple
grown
the
jack
would
not
be
left
alone
but
up
against
the
steeple
reared
became
a
clock
and
still
adhered
and
still
its
love

proserpine
glaucus
and
scylla
when
jupiter
and
his
brothers
had
defeated
the
titans
and
banished
them
to
tartarus
a
new
enemy
rose
up
against
the
gods
they
were
the
giants
typhon
briareus
enceladus
and
others
some
of
them
had
a
hundred
arms
others
breathed
out
fire
they
were
finally
subdued
and
buried
alive
under
mount
aetna
where
they
still
sometimes
struggle
to
get
loose
and
shake
the
whole
island
with
earthquakes
their
breath
comes
up
through
the
mountain
and
is
what
men
call
the
eruption
of
the
volcano
the
fall
of
these
monsters
shook
the
earth
so
that
pluto
was
alarmed
and
feared
that
his
kingdom
would
be
laid
open
to
the
light
of
day
under
this
apprehension
he
mounted
his
chariot
drawn
by
black
horses
and
took
a
circuit
of
inspection
to
satisfy
himself
of
the
extent
of
the
damage
while
he
was
thus
engaged
venus
who
was
sitting
on
mount
eryx
playing
with
her
boy
cupid
espied
him
and
said
my
son
take
your
darts
with
which
you
conquer
all
even
jove
himself
and
send
one
into
the
breast
of
yonder
dark
monarch
who
rules
the
realm
of
tartarus
why
should
he
alone
escape
seize
the
opportunity
to
extend
your
empire
and
mine
do
you
not
see
that
even
in
heaven
some
despise
our
power
minerva
the
wise
and
diana
the
huntress
defy
us
and
there
is
that
daughter
of
ceres
who
threatens
to
follow
their
example
now
do
you
if
you
have
any
regard
for
your
own
interest
or
mine
join
these
two
in
one
the
boy
unbound
his
quiver
and
selected
his
sharpest
and
truest
arrow
then
straining
the
bow
against
his
knee
he
attached
the
string
and
having
made
ready
shot
the
arrow
with
its
barbed
point
right
into
the
heart
of
pluto
in
the
vale
of
enna
there
is
a
lake
embowered
in
woods
which
screen
it
from
the
fervid
rays
of
the
sun
while
the
moist
ground
is
covered
with
flowers
and
spring
reigns
perpetual
here
proserpine
was
playing
with
her
companions
gathering
lilies
and
violets
and
filling
her
basket
and
her
apron
with
them
when
pluto
saw
her
loved
her
and
carried
her
off
she
screamed
for
help
to
her
mother
and
companions
and
when
in
her
fright
she
dropped
the
corners
of
her
apron
and
let
the
flowers
fall
childlike
she
felt
the
loss
of
them
as
an
addition
to
her
grief
the
ravisher
urged
on
his
steeds
calling
them
each
by
name
and
throwing
loose
over
their
heads
and
necks
his
reins
when
he
reached
the
river
cyane
and
it
opposed
his
passage
he
struck
the
with
his
trident
and
the
earth
opened
and
gave
him
a
passage
to
tartarus
ceres
sought
her
daughter
all
the
world
over
aurora
when
she
came
forth
in
the
morning
and
hesperus
when
he
led
out
the
stars
in
the
evening
found
her
still
busy
in
the
search
but
it
was
all
unavailing
at
length
weary
and
sad
she
sat
down
upon
a
stone
and
continued
sitting
nine
days
and
nights
in
the
open
air
under
the
sunlight
and
moonlight
and
falling
showers
it
was
where
now
stands
the
city
of
eleusis
then
the
home
of
an
old
man
named
celeus
he
was
out
in
the
field
gathering
acorns
and
blackberries
and
sticks
for
his
fire
his
little
girl
was
driving
home
their
two
goats
and
as
she
passed
the
goddess
who
appeared
in
the
guise
of
an
old
woman
she
said
to
her
mother
and
the
name
was
sweet
to
the
ears
of
ceres
why
do
you
sit
here
alone
upon
the
rocks
the
old
man
also
stopped
though
his
load
was
heavy
and
begged
her
to
come
into
his
cottage
such
as
it
was
she
declined
and
he
urged
her
go
in
peace
she
replied
and
be
happy
in
your
daughter
i
have
lost
mine
as
she
spoke
tears
or
something
like
tears
for
the
gods
never
weep
fell
down
her
cheeks
upon
her
bosom
the
compassionate
old
man
and
his
child
wept
with
her
then
said
he
come
with
us
and
despise
not
our
humble
roof
so
may
your
daughter
be
restored
to
you
in
safety
lead
on
said
she
i
can
not
resist
that
appeal
so
she
rose
from
the
stone
and
went
with
them
as
they
walked
he
told
her
that
his
only
son
a
little
boy
lay
very
sick
feverish
and
sleepless
she
stooped
and
gathered
some
poppies
as
they
entered
the
cottage
they
found
all
in
great
distress
for
the
boy
seemed
past
hope
of
recovery
metanira
his
mother
received
her
kindly
and
the
goddess
stooped
and
kissed
the
lips
of
the
sick
child
instantly
the
paleness
left
his
face
and
healthy
vigor
returned
to
his
body
the
whole
family
were
delighted
that
is
the
father
mother
and
little
girl
for
they
were
all
they
had
no
servants
they
spread
the
table
and
put
upon
it
curds
and
cream
apples
and
honey
in
the
comb
while
they
ate
ceres
mingled
poppy
juice
in
the
milk
of
the
boy
when
night
came
and
all
was
still
she
arose
and
taking
the
sleeping
boy
moulded
his
limbs
with
her
hands
and
uttered
over
him
three
times
a
solemn
charm
then
went
and
laid
him
in
the
ashes
his
mother
who
had
been
watching
what
her
guest
was
doing
sprang
forward
with
a
cry
and
snatched
the
child
from
the
fire
then
ceres
assumed
her
own
form
and
a
divine
splendor
shone
all
around
while
they
were
overcome
with
astonishment
she
said
mother
you
have
been
cruel
in
your
fondness
to
your
son
i
would
have
made
him
immortal
but
you
have
frustrated
my
attempt
nevertheless
he
shall
be
great
and
useful
he
shall
teach
men
the
use
of
the
plough
and
the
rewards
which
labor
can
win
from
the
cultivated
soil
so
saying
she
wrapped
a
cloud
about
her
and
mounting
her
chariot
rode
away
ceres
continued
her
search
for
her
daughter
passing
from
land
to
land
and
across
seas
and
rivers
till
at
length
she
returned
to
sicily
whence
she
at
first
set
out
and
stood
by
the
banks
of
the
river
cyane
where
pluto
made
himself
a
passage
with
his
prize
to
his
own
dominions
the
river
nymph
would
have
told
the
goddess
all
she
had
witnessed
but
dared
not
for
fear
of
pluto
so
she
only
ventured
to
take
up
the
girdle
which
proserpine
had
dropped
in
her
flight
and
waft
it
to
the
feet
of
the
mother
ceres
seeing
this
was
no
longer
in
doubt
of
her
loss
but
she
did
not
yet
know
the
cause
and
laid
the
blame
on
the
innocent
land
ungrateful
soil
said
she
which
i
have
endowed
with
fertility
and
clothed
with
herbage
and
nourishing
grain
no
more
shall
you
enjoy
my
favors
then
the
cattle
died
the
plough
broke
in
the
furrow
the
seed
failed
to
come
up
there
was
too
much
sun
there
was
too
much
rain
the
birds
stole
the
seeds
thistles
and
brambles
were
the
only
growth
seeing
this
the
fountain
arethusa
interceded
for
the
land
goddess
said
she
blame
not
the
land
it
opened
unwillingly
to
yield
a
passage
to
your
daughter
i
can
tell
you
of
her
fate
for
i
have
seen
her
this
is
not
my
native
country
i
came
hither
from
elis
i
was
a
woodland
nymph
and
delighted
in
the
chase
they
praised
my
beauty
but
i
cared
nothing
for
it
and
rather
boasted
of
my
hunting
exploits
one
day
i
was
returning
from
the
wood
heated
with
exercise
when
i
came
to
a
stream
silently
flowing
so
clear
that
you
might
count
the
pebbles
on
the
bottom
the
willows
shaded
it
and
the
grassy
bank
sloped
down
to
the
water
edge
i
approached
i
touched
the
water
with
my
foot
i
stepped
in
and
not
content
with
that
i
laid
my
garments
on
the
willows
and
went
in
while
i
sported
in
the
water
i
heard
an
indistinct
murmur
coming
up
as
out
of
the
depths
of
the
stream
and
made
haste
to
escape
to
the
nearest
bank
the
voice
said
do
you
fly
arethusa
i
am
alpheus
the
god
of
this
stream
i
ran
he
pursued
he
was
not
more
swift
than
i
but
he
was
stronger
and
gained
upon
me
as
my
strength
failed
at
last
exhausted
i
cried
for
help
to
diana
me
goddess
help
your
votary
the
goddess
heard
and
wrapped
me
suddenly
in
a
thick
cloud
the
river
god
looked
now
this
way
and
now
that
and
twice
came
close
to
me
but
could
not
find
me
arethusa
he
cried
oh
how
i
trembled
like
a
lamb
that
hears
the
wolf
growling
outside
the
fold
a
cold
sweat
came
over
me
my
hair
flowed
down
in
streams
where
my
foot
stood
there
was
a
pool
in
short
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
i
became
a
fountain
but
in
this
form
alpheus
knew
me
and
attempted
to
mingle
his
stream
with
mine
diana
cleft
the
ground
and
i
endeavoring
to
escape
him
plunged
into
the
cavern
and
through
the
bowels
of
the
earth
came
out
here
in
sicily
while
i
passed
through
the
lower
parts
of
the
earth
i
saw
your
proserpine
she
was
sad
but
no
longer
showing
alarm
in
her
countenance
her
look
was
such
as
became
a
queen
the
queen
of
erebus
the
powerful
bride
of
the
monarch
of
the
realms
of
the
dead
when
ceres
heard
this
she
stood
for
a
while
like
one
stupefied
then
turned
her
chariot
towards
heaven
and
hastened
to
present
herself
before
the
throne
of
jove
she
told
the
story
of
her
bereavement
and
implored
jupiter
to
interfere
to
procure
the
restitution
of
her
daughter
jupiter
consented
on
one
condition
namely
that
proserpine
should
not
during
her
stay
in
the
lower
world
have
taken
any
food
otherwise
the
fates
forbade
her
release
accordingly
mercury
was
sent
accompanied
by
spring
to
demand
proserpine
of
pluto
the
wily
monarch
consented
but
alas
the
maiden
had
taken
a
pomegranate
which
pluto
offered
her
and
had
sucked
the
sweet
pulp
from
a
few
of
the
seeds
this
was
enough
to
prevent
her
complete
release
but
a
compromise
was
made
by
which
she
was
to
pass
half
the
time
with
her
mother
and
the
rest
with
her
husband
pluto
ceres
allowed
herself
to
be
pacified
with
this
arrangement
and
restored
the
earth
to
her
favor
now
she
remembered
celeus
and
his
family
and
her
promise
to
his
infant
son
triptolemus
when
the
boy
grew
up
she
taught
him
the
use
of
the
plough
and
how
to
sow
the
seed
she
took
him
in
her
chariot
drawn
by
winged
dragons
through
all
the
countries
of
the
earth
imparting
to
mankind
valuable
grains
and
the
knowledge
of
agriculture
after
his
return
triptolemus
built
a
magnificent
temple
to
ceres
in
eleusis
and
established
the
worship
of
the
goddess
under
the
name
of
the
eleusinian
mysteries
which
in
the
splendor
and
solemnity
of
their
observance
surpassed
all
other
religious
celebrations
among
the
greeks
there
can
be
little
doubt
of
this
story
of
ceres
and
proserpine
being
an
allegory
proserpine
signifies
the
which
when
cast
into
the
ground
lies
there
concealed
that
is
she
is
carried
off
by
the
god
of
the
underworld
it
reappears
that
is
proserpine
is
restored
to
her
mother
spring
leads
her
back
to
the
light
of
day
milton
alludes
to
the
story
of
proserpine
in
paradise
lost
book
iv
not
that
fair
field
of
enna
where
proserpine
gathering
flowers
herself
a
fairer
flower
by
gloomy

was
gathered
which
cost

all
that
pain
to
seek

through

in

the

very
beautifully
forgive
if
somewhile
i
forget
in
woe
to
come
the
present

as
frighted

let
fall
her
flowers
at
the
sight
of
dis
the

alpheus
does
in
fact
disappear
underground
in
part
of
its
course
finding
its
way
through
subterranean
channels
till
it
again
appears
on
the
surface
it
was
said
that
the
sicilian
fountain
arethusa
was
the
same
stream
which
after
passing
under
the
sea
came
up
again
in
sicily
hence
the
story
ran
that
a
cup
thrown
into
the
alpheus
appeared
again
in
arethusa
it
is
this
fable
of
the
underground
course
of
alpheus
that
coleridge
alludes
to
in
his
poem
of
kubla
khan
in
xanadu
did
kubla
khan
a
stately
decree
where
alph
the
sacred
river
ran
through
caverns
measureless
to
man
down
to
a
sunless
sea
in
one
of
moore
juvenile
poems
he
thus
alludes
to
the
same
story
and
to
the
practice
of
throwing
garlands
or
other
light
objects
on
his
stream
to
be
carried
downward
by
it
and
afterwards
reproduced
at
its
emerging
o
my
beloved
how
divinely
sweet
is
the
pure
joy
when
kindred
spirits
meet
like
him
the
river
god
whose
waters
flow
with
love
their
only
light
through
caves
below
wafting
in
triumph
all
the
flowery
braids
and
festal
rings
with
which
olympic
maids
have
decked
his
current
as
an
offering
meet
to
lay
at
arethusa
shining
feet
think
when
he
meets
at
last
his
fountain
bride
what
perfect
love
must
thrill
the
blended
tide
each
lost
in
each
till
mingling
into
one
their
lot
the
same
for
shadow
or
for
sun
a
type
of
true
love
to
the
deep
they
run
the
following
extract
from
moore
rhymes
on
the
road
gives
an
account
of
a
celebrated
picture
by
albano
at
milan
called
a
dance
of
loves
is
for
the
theft
ef
enna
flower
from

these
urchins
celebrate
their
dance
of
mirth
round
the
green
tree
like
fays
upon
a
heath
those
that
are
nearest
linked
in
order
bright
cheek
after
cheek
like
rosebuds
in
a
wreath
and
those
more
distant
showing
from
beneath
the
others
wings
their
little
eyes
of
light
while
see
among
the
clouds
their
eldest
brother
but
just
flown
up
tells
with
a
smile
of
bliss
this
prank
of
pluto
to
his
charmed
mother
who
turns
to
greet
the
tidings
with
a
kiss
glaucus
and
scylla
glaucus
was
a
fisherman
one
day
he
had
drawn
his
nets
to
land
and
had
taken
a
great
many
fishes
of
various
kinds
so
he
emptied
his
net
and
proceeded
to
sort
the
fishes
on
the
grass
the
place
where
he
stood
was
a
beautiful
island
in
the
river
a
solitary
spot
uninhabited
and
not
used
for
pasturage
of
cattle
nor
ever
visited
by
any
but
himself
on
a
sudden
the
fishes
which
had
been
laid
on
the
grass
began
to
revive
and
move
their
fins
as
if
they
were
in
the
water
and
while
he
looked
on
astonished
they
one
and
all
moved
off
to
the
water
plunged
in
and
swam
away
he
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
this
whether
some
god
had
done
it
or
some
secret
power
in
the
herbage
what
herb
has
such
a
power
he
exclaimed
and
gathering
some
of
it
he
tasted
it
scarce
had
the
juices
of
the
plant
reached
his
palate
when
he
found
himself
agitated
with
a
longing
desire
for
the
water
he
could
no
longer
restrain
himself
but
bidding
farewell
to
earth
he
plunged
into
the
stream
the
gods
of
the
water
received
him
graciously
and
admitted
him
to
the
honor
of
their
society
they
obtained
the
consent
of
oceanus
and
tethys
the
sovereigns
of
the
sea
that
all
that
was
mortal
in
him
should
be
washed
away
a
hundred
rivers
poured
their
waters
over
him
then
he
lost
all
sense
of
his
former
nature
and
all
consciousness
when
he
recovered
he
found
himself
changed
in
form
and
mind
his
hair
was
and
trailed
behind
him
on
the
water
his
shoulders
grew
broad
and
what
had
been
thighs
and
legs
assumed
the
form
of
a
fish
tail
the
gods
complimented
him
on
the
change
of
his
appearance
and
he
fancied
himself
rather
a
personage
one
day
glaucus
saw
the
beautiful
maiden
scylla
the
favorite
of
the
rambling
on
the
shore
and
when
she
had
found
a
sheltered
nook
laving
her
limbs
in
the
clear
water
he
fell
in
love
with
her
and
showing
himself
on
the
surface
spoke
to
her
saying
such
things
as
he
thought
most
likely
to
win
her
to
stay
for
she
turned
to
run
immediately
on
the
sight
of
him
and
ran
till
she
had
gained
a
cliff
overlooking
the
sea
here
she
stopped
and
turned
round
to
see
whether
it
was
a
god
or
a
sea
animal
and
observed
with
wonder
his
shape
and
color
glaucus
partly
emerging
from
the
water
and
supporting
himself
against
a
rock
said
maiden
i
am
no
monster
nor
a
sea
animal
but
a
god
and
neither
proteus
nor
triton
ranks
higher
than
i
once
i
was
a
mortal
and
followed
the
sea
for
a
living
but
now
i
belong
wholly
to
it
then
he
told
the
story
of
his
metamorphosis
and
how
he
had
been
promoted
to
his
present
dignity
and
added
but
what
avails
all
this
if
it
fails
to
move
your
heart
he
was
going
on
in
this
strain
but
scylla
turned
and
hastened
away
glaucus
was
in
despair
but
it
occurred
to
him
to
consult
the
enchantress
circe
accordingly
he
repaired
to
her
island
the
same
where
afterwards
ulysses
landed
as
we
shall
see
in
one
of
our
later
stories
after
mutual
salutations
he
said
goddess
i
entreat
your
pity
you
alone
can
relieve
the
pain
i
suffer
the
power
of
herbs
i
know
as
well
as
any
one
for
it
is
to
them
i
owe
my
change
of
form
i
love
scylla
i
am
ashamed
to
tell
you
how
i
have
sued
and
promised
to
her
and
how
scornfully
she
has
treated
me
i
beseech
you
to
use
your
incantations
or
potent
herbs
if
they
are
more
prevailing
not
to
cure
me
of
my
love
for
that
i
do
not
wish
but
to
make
her
share
it
and
yield
me
a
like
return
to
which
circe
replied
for
she
was
not
insensible
to
the
attractions
of
the
deity
you
had
better
pursue
a
willing
object
you
are
worthy
to
be
sought
instead
of
having
to
seek
in
vain
be
not
diffident
know
your
own
worth
i
protest
to
you
that
even
i
goddess
though
i
be
and
learned
in
the
virtues
of
plants
and
spells
should
not
know
how
to
refuse
you
if
she
scorns
you
scorn
her
meet
one
who
is
ready
to
meet
you
half
way
and
thus
make
a
due
return
to
both
at
once
to
these
words
glaucus
replied
sooner
shall
trees
grow
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
and
on
the
top
of
the
mountains
than
i
will
cease
to
love
scylla
and
her
alone
the
goddess
was
indignant
but
she
could
not
punish
him
neither
did
she
wish
to
do
so
for
she
liked
him
too
well
so
she
turned
all
her
wrath
against
her
rival
poor
scylla
she
took
plants
of
poisonous
powers
and
mixed
them
together
with
incantations
and
charms
then
she
passed
through
the
crowd
of
gambolling
beasts
the
victims
of
her
art
and
proceeded
to
the
coast
of
sicily
where
scylla
lived
there
was
a
little
bay
on
the
shore
to
which
scylla
used
to
resort
in
the
heat
of
the
day
to
breathe
the
air
of
the
sea
and
to
bathe
in
its
waters
here
the
goddess
poured
her
poisonous
mixture
and
muttered
over
it
incantations
of
mighty
power
scylla
came
as
usual
and
plunged
into
the
water
up
to
her
waist
what
was
her
horror
to
perceive
a
brood
of
serpents
and
barking
monsters
surrounding
her
at
first
she
could
not
imagine
they
were
a
part
of
herself
and
tried
to
run
from
them
and
to
drive
them
away
but
as
she
ran
she
carried
them
with
her
and
when
she
tried
to
touch
her
limbs
she
found
her
hands
touch
only
the
yawning
jaws
of
monsters
scylla
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
her
temper
grew
as
ugly
as
her
form
and
she
took
pleasure
in
devouring
hapless
mariners
who
came
within
her
grasp
thus
she
destroyed
six
of
the
companions
of
ulysses
and
tried
to
wreck
the
ships
of
aeneas
till
at
last
she
was
turned
into
a
rock
and
as
such
still
continues
to
be
a
terror
to
mariners
keats
in
his
endymion
has
given
a
new
version
of
the
ending
of
glaucus
and
scylla
glaucus
consents
to
circe
blandishments
till
he
by
chance
is
witness
to
her
transactions
with
her
beasts
disgusted
with
her
treachery
and
cruelty
he
tries
to
escape
from
her
but
is
taken
and
brought
back
when
with
reproaches
she
banishes
him
sentencing
him
to
pass
a
thousand
years
in
decrepitude
and
pain
he
returns
to
the
sea
and
there
finds
the
body
of
scylla
whom
the
goddess
has
not
transformed
but
drowned
glaucus
learns
that
his
destiny
is
that
if
he
passes
his
thousand
years
in
collecting
all
the
bodies
of
drowned
lovers
a
youth
beloved
of
the
gods
will
appear
and
help
him
endymion
fulfils
this
prophecy
and
aids
in
restoring
glaucus
to
youth
and
scylla
and
all
the
drowned
lovers
to
life
the
following
is
glaucus
account
of
his
feelings
after
his
change
i
plunged
for
life
or
death
to
interknit
one
senses
with
so
dense
a
breathing
stuff
might
seem
a
work
of
pain
so
not
enough
can
i
admire
how
it
felt
and
buoyant
round
my
limbs
at
first
i
dwelt
whole
days
and
days
in
sheer
astonishment
forgetful
utterly
of
moving
but
with
the
mighty
ebb
and
flow
then
like
a
bird
that
first
doth
show
his
spreaded
feathers
to
the
morrow
chill
i
tried
in
fear
the
pinions
of
my
will

and
at
once
i
visited

ceaseless
wonders

chapter
viii
pygmalion
and
adonis
apollo
and
hyacinthus
pygmalion
saw
so
much
to
blame
in
women
that
he
came
at
last
to
abhor
the
sex
and
resolved
to
live
unmarried
he
was
a
sculptor
and
had
made
with
wonderful
skill
a
statue
of
ivory
so
beautiful
that
no
living
woman
came
anywhere
near
it
it
was
indeed
the
perfect
semblance
of
a
maiden
that
seemed
to
be
alive
and
only
prevented
from
moving
by
modesty
his
art
was
so
perfect
that
it
concealed
itself
and
its
product
looked
like
the
workmanship
of
nature
pygmalion
admired
his
own
work
and
at
last
fell
in
love
with
the
counterfeit
creation
oftentimes
he
laid
his
hand
upon
it
as
if
to
assure
himself
whether
it
were
living
or
not
and
could
not
even
then
believe
that
it
was
only
ivory
he
caressed
it
and
gave
it
presents
such
as
young
girls
love
bright
shells
and
polished
stones
little
birds
and
flowers
of
various
hues
beads
and
amber
he
put
raiment
on
its
limbs
and
jewels
on
its
fingers
and
a
necklace
about
its
neck
to
the
ears
he
hung
earrings
and
strings
of
pearls
upon
the
breast
her
dress
became
her
and
she
looked
not
less
charming
than
when
unattired
he
laid
her
on
a
couch
spread
with
cloths
of
tyrian
dye
and
called
her
his
wife
and
put
her
head
upon
a
pillow
of
the
softest
feathers
as
if
she
could
enjoy
their
softness
the
festival
of
venus
was
at
hand
a
festival
celebrated
with
great
pomp
at
cyprus
victims
were
offered
the
altars
smoked
and
the
odor
of
incense
filled
the
air
when
pygmalion
had
performed
his
part
in
the
solemnities
he
stood
before
the
altar
and
timidly
said
ye
gods
who
can
do
all
things
give
me
i
pray
you
for
my
wife
he
dared
not
say
my
ivory
virgin
but
said
instead
one
like
my
ivory
virgin
venus
who
was
present
at
the
festival
heard
him
and
knew
the
thought
he
would
have
uttered
and
as
an
omen
of
her
favor
caused
the
flame
on
the
altar
to
shoot
up
thrice
in
a
fiery
point
into
the
air
when
he
returned
home
he
went
to
see
his
statue
and
leaning
over
the
couch
gave
a
kiss
to
the
mouth
it
seemed
to
be
warm
he
pressed
its
lips
again
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
limbs
the
ivory
felt
soft
to
his
touch
and
yielded
to
his
fingers
like
the
wax
of
hymettus
while
he
stands
astonished
and
glad
though
doubting
and
fears
he
may
be
mistaken
again
and
again
with
a
lover
ardor
he
touches
the
object
of
his
hopes
it
was
indeed
alive
the
veins
when
pressed
yielded
to
the
finger
and
again
resumed
their
roundness
then
at
last
the
votary
of
venus
found
words
to
thank
the
goddess
and
pressed
his
lips
upon
lips
as
real
as
his
own
the
virgin
felt
the
kisses
and
blushed
and
opening
her
timid
eyes
to
the
light
fixed
them
at
the
same
moment
on
her
lover
venus
blessed
the
nuptials
she
had
formed
and
from
this
union
paphos
was
born
from
whom
the
city
sacred
to
venus
received
its
name
schiller
in
his
poem
the
ideals
applies
this
tale
of
pygmalion
to
the
love
of
nature
in
a
youthful
heart
the
following
translation
is
furnished
by
a
friend
as
once
with
prayers
in
passion
flowing
pygmalion
embraced
the
stone
till
from
the
frozen
marble
glowing
the
light
of
feeling
him
shone
so
did
i
clasp
with
young
devotion
bright
nature
to
a
poet
heart
till
breath
and
warmth
and
vital
motion
seemed
through
the
statue
form
to
dart
and
then
in
all
my
ardor
sharing
the
silent
form
expression
found
returned
my
kiss
of
youthful
daring
and
understood
my
heart
quick
sound
then
lived
for
me
the
bright
creation
the
silver
rill
with
song
was
rife
the
trees
the
roses
shared
sensation
an
echo
of
my
boundless
life
dryope
dryope
and
iole
were
sisters
the
former
was
the
wife
of
andraemon
beloved
by
her
husband
and
happy
in
the
birth
of
her
first
child
one
day
the
sisters
strolled
to
the
bank
of
a
stream
that
sloped
gradually
down
to
the
water
edge
while
the
upland
was
overgrown
with
myrtles
they
were
intending
to
gather
flowers
for
forming
garlands
for
the
altars
of
the
nymphs
and
dryope
carried
her
child
at
her
bosom
precious
burden
and
nursed
him
as
she
walked
near
the
water
grew
a
lotus
plant
full
of
purple
flowers
dryope
gathered
some
and
offered
them
to
the
baby
and
iole
was
about
to
do
the
same
when
she
perceived
blood
dropping
from
the
places
where
her
sister
had
broken
them
off
the
stem
the
plant
was
no
other
than
the
nymph
lotis
who
running
from
a
base
pursuer
had
been
changed
into
this
form
this
they
learned
from
the
country
people
when
it
was
too
late
dryope
when
she
perceived
what
she
had
done
would
gladly
have
hastened
from
the
spot
but
found
her
feet
rooted
to
the
ground
she
tried
to
pull
them
away
but
moved
nothing
but
her
upper
limbs
the
woodiness
crept
upward
and
by
degrees
invested
her
body
in
anguish
she
attempted
to
tear
her
hair
but
found
her
hands
filled
with
leaves
the
infant
felt
his
mother
bosom
begin
to
harden
and
the
milk
cease
to
flow
iole
looked
on
at
the
sad
fate
of
her
sister
and
could
render
no
assistance
she
embraced
the
growing
trunk
as
if
she
would
hold
back
the
advancing
wood
and
would
gladly
have
been
enveloped
in
the
same
bark
at
this
moment
andraemon
the
husband
of
dryope
with
her
father
approached
and
when
they
asked
for
dryope
iole
pointed
them
to
the
lotus
they
embraced
the
trunk
of
the
yet
warm
tree
and
showered
their
kisses
on
its
leaves
now
there
was
nothing
left
of
dryope
but
her
face
her
tears
still
flowed
and
fell
on
her
leaves
and
while
she
could
she
spoke
i
am
not
guilty
i
deserve
not
this
fate
i
have
injured
no
one
if
i
speak
falsely
may
my
foliage
perish
with
drought
and
my
trunk
be
cut
down
and
burned
take
this
infant
and
give
it
to
a
nurse
let
it
often
be
brought
and
nursed
under
my
branches
and
play
in
my
shade
and
when
he
is
old
enough
to
talk
let
him
be
taught
to
call
me
mother
and
to
say
with
sadness
mother
lies
hid
under
this
bark
but
bid
him
be
careful
of
river
banks
and
beware
how
he
plucks
flowers
remembering
that
every
bush
he
sees
may
be
a
goddess
in
disguise
farewell
dear
husband
and
sister
and
father
if
you
retain
any
love
for
me
let
not
the
axe
wound
me
nor
the
flocks
bite
and
tear
my
branches
since
i
can
not
stoop
to
you
climb
up
hither
and
kiss
me
and
while
my
lips
continue
to
feel
lift
up
my
child
that
i
may
kiss
him
i
can
speak
no
more
for
already
the
bark
advances
up
my
neck
and
will
soon
shoot
over
me
you
need
not
close
my
eyes
the
bark
will
close
them
without
your
aid
then
the
lips
ceased
to
move
and
life
was
extinct
but
the
branches
retained
for
some
time
longer
the
vital
heat
keats
in
endymion
alludes
to
dryope
thus
she
took
a
lute
from
which
there
pulsing
came
a
lively
prelude
fashioning
the
way
in
which
her
voice
should
wander
was
a
lay

more
than

of

one
day
with
her
boy
cupid
wounded
her
bosom
with
one
of
his
arrows
she
pushed
him
away
but
the
wound
was
deeper
than
she
thought
before
it
healed
she
beheld
adonis
and
was
captivated
with
him
she
no
longer
took
any
interest
in
her
favorite
resorts
paphos
and
cnidos
and
amathos
rich
in
metals
she
absented
herself
even
from

for
adonis
was
dearer
to
her
than
heaven
him
she
followed
and
bore
him
company
she
who
used
to
love
to
recline
in
the
shade
with
no
care
but
to
cultivate
her
charms

through

over

hills

like
the
huntress

calls
her
dogs
and
chases

it

too
to
beware
of
such
dangerous
animals
be
brave
towards
the
timid
said
she
courage
against
the
courageous
is
not
safe
beware
how
you
expose
yourself
to
danger
and
put
my
happiness
to
risk
attack
not
the
beasts
that
nature
has
armed
with
weapons
i
do
not
value
your
glory
so
high
as
to
consent
to
purchase
it
by
such
exposure
your
youth
and
the
beauty
that
charms
venus
will
not
touch
the
hearts
of
lions
and
bristly
boars
think
of
their
terrible
claws
and
prodigious
strength
i
hate
the
whole
race
of
them
do
you
ask
me
why
then
she
told
him
the
story
of
atalanta
and
hippomenes
who
were
changed
into
lions
for
their
ingratitude
to
her
having
given
him
this
warning
she
mounted
her
chariot
drawn
by
swans
and
drove
away
through
the
air
but
adonis
was
too
noble
to
heed
such
counsels
the
dogs
had
roused
a
wild
boar
from
his
lair
and
the
youth
threw
his
spear
and
wounded
the
animal
with
a
sidelong
stroke
the
beast
drew
out
the
weapon
with
his
jaws
and
rushed
after
adonis
who
turned
and
ran
but
the
boar
overtook
him
and
buried
his
tusks
in
his
side
and
stretched
him
dying
upon
the
plain
venus
in
her
chariot
had
not
yet
reached
cyprus
when
she
heard
coming
up
through
the
groans
of
her
beloved
and
turned
her
coursers
back
to
earth
as
she
drew
near
and
saw
from
on
high
his
lifeless
body
bathed
in
blood
she
alighted
and
bending
over
it
beat
her
breast
and
tore
her
hair
reproaching
the
fates
she
said
yet
theirs
shall
be
but
a
partial
triumph
memorials
of
my
grief
shall
endure
and
the
spectacle
of
your
death
my
adonis
and
of
my
lamentations
shall
be
annually
renewed
your
blood
shall
be
changed
into
a
flower
that
consolation
none
can
envy
me
thus
speaking
she
sprinkled
nectar
on
the
blood
and
as
they
mingled
bubbles
rose
as
in
a
pool
on
which
raindrops
fall
and
in
an
hour
time
there
sprang
up
a
flower
of
bloody
hue
like
that
of
the
pomegranate
but
it
is
it
is
said
the
wind
blows
the
blossoms
open
and
afterwards
blows
the
petals
away
so
it
is
called
anemone
or
wind
flower
from
the
cause
which
assists
equally
in
its
production
and
its
decay
milton
alludes
to
the
story
of
venus
and
adonis
in
his
comus
beds
of
hyacinth
and
roses
where
young
adonis
oft
reposes
waxing
well
of
his
deep
wound
in
slumber
soft
and
on
the
ground
sadly
sits

assyrian
queen
etc
apollo
and
hyacinthus
apollo
was
passionately
fond
of
a
youth
named
hyacinthus
he
accompanied
him
in
his
sports
carried
the
nets
when
he
went
fishing
led
the
dogs
when
he
went
to
hunt
followed
him
in
his
excursions
in
the
mountains
and
neglected
for
him
his
lyre
and
his
arrows
one
day
they
played
a
game
of
quoits
together
and
apollo
heaving
aloft
the
discus
with
strength
mingled
with
skill
sent
it
high
and
far
hyacinthus
watched
it
as
it
flew
and
excited
with
the
sport
ran
forward
to
seize
it
eager
to
make
his
throw
when
the
quoit
bounded
from
the
earth
and
struck
him
in
the
forehead
he
fainted
and
fell
the
god
as
pale
as
himself
raised
him
and
tried
all
his
art
to
stanch
the
wound
and
retain
the
flitting
life
but
all
in
vain
the
hurt
was
past
the
power
of
medicine
as
when
one
has
broken
the
stem
of
a
lily
in
the
garden
it
hangs
its
head
and
turns
its
flowers
to
the
earth
so
the
head
of
the
dying
boy
as
if
too
heavy
for
his
neck
fell
over
on
his
shoulder
thou
diest
hyacinth
so
spoke
phoebus
robbed
of
thy
youth
by
me
thine
is
the
suffering
mine
the
crime
would
that
i
could
die
for
thee
but
since
that
may
not
be
thou
shalt
live
with
me
in
memory
and
in
song
my
lyre
shall
celebrate
thee
my
song
shall
tell
thy
fate
and
thou
shalt
become
a
flower
inscribed
with
my
regrets
while
apollo
spoke
behold
the
blood
which
had
flowed
on
the
ground
and
stained
the
herbage
ceased
to
be
blood
but
a
flower
of
hue
more
beautiful
than
the
tyrian
sprang
up
resembling
the
lily
if
it
were
not
that
this
is
purple
and
that
silvery
white
footnote
it
is
evidently
not
our
modern
hyacinth
that
is
here
described
it
is
perhaps
some
species
of
iris
or
perhaps
of
larkspur
or
of
pansy
and
this
was
not
enough
for
phoebus
but
to
confer
still
greater
honor
he
marked
the
petals
with
his
sorrow
and
inscribed
ah
ah
upon
them
as
we
see
to
this
day
the
flower
bears
the
name
of
hyacinthus
and
with
every
returning
spring
revives
the
memory
of
his
fate
it
was
said
that
zephyrus
the
west
wind
who
was
also
fond
of
hyacinthus
and
jealous
of
his
preference
of
apollo
blew
the
quoit
out
of
its
course
to
make
it
strike
hyacinthus
keats
alludes
to
this
in
his
endymion
where
he
describes
the
at
the
game
of
quoits
or
they
might
watch
the
intent
on
either
side
pitying
the
sad
death
of
hyacinthus
when
the
cruel
breath
of
zephyr
slew
him
zephyr
penitent
who
now
ere
phoebus
mounts
the
firmament
fondles
the
flower
amid
the
sobbing
rain
an
allusion
to
hyacinthus
will
also
be
recognized
in
lycidas
like
to
that
sanguine
flower
inscribed
with
woe
chapter
ix
ceyx
and
halcyone
or
the
halcyon
birds
ceyx
was
king
of
thessaly
where
he
reigned
in
peace
without
violence
or
wrong
he
was
son
of
hesperus
the
and
the
glow
of
his
beauty
reminded
one
of
his
father
halcyone
the
daughter
of
aeolus
was
his
wife
and
devotedly
attached
to
him
now
ceyx
was
in
deep
affliction
for
the
loss
of
his
brother
and
direful
prodigies
following
his
brother
death
made
him
feel
as
if
the
gods
were
hostile
to
him
he
thought
best
therefore
to
make
a
voyage
to
carlos
in
ionia
to
consult
the
oracle
of
apollo
but
as
soon
as
he
disclosed
his
intention
to
his
wife
halcyone
a
shudder
ran
through
her
frame
and
her
face
grew
deadly
pale
what
fault
of
mine
dearest
husband
has
turned
your
affection
from
me
where
is
that
love
of
me
that
used
to
be
uppermost
in
your
thoughts
have
you
learned
to
feel
easy
in
the
absence
of
halcyone
would
you
rather
have
me
away
she
also
endeavored
to
discourage
him
by
describing
the
violence
of
the
winds
which
she
had
known
familiarly
when
she
lived
at
home
in
her
house
aeolus
being
the
god
of
the
winds
and
having
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
restrain
them
they
rush
together
said
she
with
such
fury
that
fire
flashes
from
the
conflict
but
if
you
must
go
she
added
dear
husband
let
me
go
with
you
otherwise
i
shall
suffer
not
only
the
real
evils
which
you
must
encounter
but
those
also
which
my
fears
suggest
these
words
weighed
heavily
on
the
mind
of
king
ceyx
and
it
was
no
less
his
own
wish
than
hers
to
take
her
with
him
but
he
could
not
bear
to
expose
her
to
the
dangers
of
the
sea
he
answered
therefore
consoling
her
as
well
as
he
could
and
finished
with
these
words
i
promise
by
the
rays
of
my
father
the
that
if
fate
permits
i
will
return
before
the
moon
shall
have
twice
rounded
her
orb
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
ordered
the
vessel
to
be
drawn
out
of
the
shiphouse
and
the
oars
and
sails
to
be
put
aboard
when
halcyone
saw
these
preparations
she
shuddered
as
if
with
a
presentiment
of
evil
with
tears
and
sobs
she
said
farewell
and
then
fell
senseless
to
the
ground
ceyx
would
still
have
lingered
but
now
the
young
men
grasped
their
oars
and
pulled
vigorously
through
the
waves
with
long
and
measured
strokes
halcyone
raised
her
streaming
eyes
and
saw
her
husband
standing
on
the
deck
waving
his
hand
to
her
she
answered
his
signal
till
the
vessel
had
receded
so
far
that
she
could
no
longer
distinguish
his
form
from
the
rest
when
the
vessel
itself
could
no
more
be
seen
she
strained
her
eyes
to
catch
the
last
glimmer
of
the
sail
till
that
too
disappeared
then
retiring
to
her
chamber
she
threw
herself
on
her
solitary
couch
meanwhile
they
glide
out
of
the
harbor
and
the
breeze
plays
among
the
ropes
the
seamen
draw
in
their
oars
and
hoist
their
sails
when
half
or
less
of
their
course
was
passed
as
night
drew
on
the
sea
began
to
whiten
with
swelling
waves
and
the
east
wind
to
blow
a
gale
the
master
gave
the
word
to
take
in
sail
but
the
storm
forbade
obedience
for
such
is
the
roar
of
the
winds
and
waves
his
orders
are
unheard
the
men
of
their
own
accord
busy
themselves
to
secure
the
oars
to
strengthen
the
ship
to
reef
the
sail
while
they
thus
do
what
to
each
one
seems
best
the
storm
increases
the
shouting
of
the
men
the
rattling
of
the
shrouds
and
the
dashing
of
the
waves
mingle
with
the
roar
of
the
thunder
the
swelling
sea
seems
lifted
up
to
the
heavens
to
scatter
its
foam
among
the
clouds
then
sinking
away
to
the
bottom
assumes
the
color
of
the
shoal
a
stygian
blackness
the
vessel
shares
all
these
changes
it
seems
like
a
wild
beast
that
rushes
on
the
spears
of
the
hunters
rain
falls
in
torrents
as
if
the
skies
were
coming
down
to
unite
with
the
sea
when
the
lightning
ceases
for
a
moment
the
night
seems
to
add
its
own
darkness
to
that
of
the
storm
then
comes
the
flash
rending
the
darkness
asunder
and
lighting
up
all
with
a
glare
skill
fails
courage
sinks
and
death
seems
to
come
on
every
wave
the
men
are
stupefied
with
terror
the
thought
of
parents
and
kindred
and
pledges
left
at
home
comes
over
their
minds
ceyx
thinks
of
halcyone
no
name
but
hers
is
on
his
lips
and
while
he
yearns
for
her
he
yet
rejoices
in
her
absence
presently
the
mast
is
shattered
by
a
stroke
of
lightning
the
rudder
broken
and
the
triumphant
surge
curling
over
looks
down
upon
the
wreck
then
falls
and
crushes
it
to
fragments
some
of
the
seamen
stunned
by
the
stroke
sink
and
rise
no
more
others
cling
to
fragments
of
the
wreck
ceyx
with
the
hand
that
used
to
grasp
the
sceptre
holds
fast
to
a
plank
calling
for
help
alas
in
vain
upon
his
father
and
his
but
oftenest
on
his
lips
was
the
name
of
halcyone
to
her
his
thoughts
cling
he
prays
that
the
waves
may
bear
his
body
to
her
sight
and
that
it
may
receive
burial
at
her
hands
at
length
the
waters
overwhelm
him
and
he
sinks
the
looked
dim
that
night
since
it
could
not
leave
the
heavens
it
shrouded
its
face
with
clouds
in
the
meanwhile
halcyone
ignorant
of
all
these
horrors
counted
the
days
till
her
husband
promised
return
now
she
gets
ready
the
garments
which
he
shall
put
on
and
now
what
she
shall
wear
when
he
arrives
to
all
the
gods
she
offers
frequent
incense
but
more
than
all
to
juno
for
her
husband
who
was
no
more
she
prayed
incessantly
that
he
might
be
safe
that
he
might
come
home
that
he
might
not
in
his
absence
see
any
one
that
he
would
love
better
than
her
but
of
all
these
prayers
the
last
was
the
only
one
destined
to
be
granted
the
goddess
at
length
could
not
bear
any
longer
to
be
pleaded
with
for
one
already
dead
and
to
have
hands
raised
to
her
altars
that
ought
rather
to
be
offering
funeral
rites
so
calling
iris
she
said
iris
my
faithful
messenger
go
to
the
drowsy
dwelling
of
somnus
and
tell
him
to
send
a
vision
to
halcyone
in
the
form
of
ceyx
to
make
known
to
her
the
event
iris
puts
on
her
robe
of
many
colors
and
tingeing
the
sky
with
her
bow
seeks
the
palace
of
the
king
of
sleep
near
the
cimmerian
country
a
mountain
cave
is
the
abode
of
the
dull
god
somnus
here
phoebus
dares
not
come
either
rising
at
midday
or
setting
clouds
and
shadows
are
exhaled
from
the
ground
and
the
light
glimmers
faintly
the
bird
of
dawning
with
crested
head
never
there
calls
aloud
to
aurora
nor
watchful
dog
nor
more
sagacious
goose
disturbs
the
silence
no
wild
beast
nor
cattle
nor
branch
moved
with
the
wind
nor
sound
of
human
conversation
breaks
the
stillness
silence
reigns
there
but
from
the
bottom
of
the
rock
the
river
lethe
flows
and
by
its
murmur
invites
to
sleep
poppies
grow
abundantly
before
the
door
of
the
cave
and
other
herbs
from
whose
juices
night
collects
slumbers
which
she
scatters
over
the
darkened
earth
there
is
no
gate
to
the
mansion
to
creak
on
its
hinges
nor
any
watchman
but
in
the
midst
a
couch
of
black
ebony
adorned
with
black
plumes
and
black
curtains
there
the
god
reclines
his
limbs
relaxed
with
sleep
around
him
lie
dreams
resembling
all
various
forms
as
many
as
the
harvest
bears
stalks
or
the
forest
leaves
or
the
seashore
sand
grains
as
soon
as
the
goddess
entered
and
brushed
away
the
dreams
that
hovered
around
her
her
brightness
lit
up
all
the
cave
the
god
scarce
opening
his
eyes
and
ever
and
anon
dropping
his
beard
upon
his
breast
at
last
shook
himself
free
from
himself
and
leaning
on
his
arm
inquired
her
errand
for
he
knew
who
she
was
she
answered
somnus
gentlest
of
the
gods
tranquillizer
of
minds
and
soother
of
hearts
juno
sends
you
her
commands
that
you
despatch
a
dream
to
halcyone
in
the
city
of
trachine
representing
her
lost
husband
and
all
the
events
of
the
wreck
having
delivered
her
message
iris
hasted
away
for
she
could
not
longer
endure
the
stagnant
air
and
as
she
felt
drowsiness
creeping
over
her
she
made
her
escape
and
returned
by
her
bow
the
way
she
came
then
somnus
called
one
of
his
numerous
sons
morpheus
the
most
expert
in
counterfeiting
forms
and
in
imitating
the
walk
the
countenance
and
mode
of
speaking
even
the
clothes
and
attitudes
most
characteristic
of
each
but
he
only
imitates
men
leaving
it
to
another
to
personate
birds
beasts
and
serpents
him
they
call
icelos
and
phantasos
is
a
third
who
turns
himself
into
rocks
waters
woods
and
other
things
without
life
these
wait
upon
kings
and
great
personages
in
their
sleeping
hours
while
others
move
among
the
common
people
somnus
chose
from
all
the
brothers
morpheus
to
perform
the
command
of
iris
then
laid
his
head
on
his
pillow
and
yielded
himself
to
grateful
repose
morpheus
flew
making
no
noise
with
his
wings
and
soon
came
to
the
haemonian
city
where
laying
aside
his
wings
he
assumed
the
form
of
ceyx
under
that
form
but
pale
like
a
dead
man
naked
he
stood
before
the
couch
of
the
wretched
wife
his
beard
seemed
soaked
with
water
and
water
trickled
from
his
drowned
locks
leaning
over
the
bed
tears
streaming
from
his
eyes
he
said
do
you
recognize
your
ceyx
unhappy
wife
or
has
death
too
much
changed
my
visage
behold
me
know
me
your
husband
shade
instead
of
himself
your
prayers
halcyone
availed
me
nothing
i
am
dead
no
more
deceive
yourself
with
vain
hopes
of
my
return
the
stormy
winds
sunk
my
ship
in
the
aegean
sea
waves
filled
my
mouth
while
it
called
aloud
on
you
no
uncertain
messenger
tells
you
this
no
vague
rumor
brings
it
to
your
ears
i
come
in
person
a
shipwrecked
man
to
tell
you
my
fate
arise
give
me
tears
give
me
lamentations
let
me
not
go
down
to
tartarus
unwept
to
these
words
morpheus
added
the
voice
which
seemed
to
be
that
of
her
husband
he
seemed
to
pour
forth
genuine
tears
his
hands
had
the
gestures
of
ceyx
halcyone
weeping
groaned
and
stretched
out
her
arms
in
her
sleep
striving
to
embrace
his
body
but
grasping
only
the
air
stay
she
cried
whither
do
you
fly
let
us
go
together
her
own
voice
awakened
her
starting
up
she
gazed
eagerly
around
to
see
if
he
was
still
present
for
the
servants
alarmed
by
her
cries
had
brought
a
light
when
she
found
him
not
she
smote
her
breast
and
rent
her
garments
she
cares
not
to
unbind
her
hair
but
tears
it
wildly
her
nurse
asks
what
is
the
cause
of
her
grief
halcyone
is
no
more
she
answers
she
perished
with
her
ceyx
utter
not
words
of
comfort
he
is
shipwrecked
and
dead
i
have
seen
him
i
have
recognized
him
i
stretched
out
my
hands
to
seize
him
and
detain
him
his
shade
vanished
but
it
was
the
true
shade
of
my
husband
not
with
the
accustomed
features
not
with
the
beauty
that
was
his
but
pale
naked
and
with
his
hair
wet
with
he
appeared
to
wretched
me
here
in
this
very
spot
the
sad
vision
stood
and
she
looked
to
find
the
mark
of
his
footsteps
this
it
was
this
that
my
presaging
mind
foreboded
when
i
implored
him
not
to
leave
me
to
trust
himself
to
the
waves
oh
how
i
wish
since
thou
wouldst
go
thou
hadst
taken
me
with
thee
it
would
have
been
far
better
then
i
should
have
had
no
remnant
of
life
to
spend
without
thee
nor
a
separate
death
to
die
if
i
could
bear
to
live
and
struggle
to
endure
i
should
be
more
cruel
to
myself
than
the
sea
has
been
to
me
but
i
will
not
struggle
i
will
not
be
separated
from
thee
unhappy
husband
this
time
at
least
i
will
keep
thee
company
in
death
if
one
tomb
may
not
include
us
one
epitaph
shall
if
i
may
not
lay
my
ashes
with
thine
my
name
at
least
shall
not
be
separated
her
grief
forbade
more
words
and
these
were
broken
with
tears
and
sobs
it
was
now
morning
she
went
to
the
seashore
and
sought
the
spot
where
she
last
saw
him
on
his
departure
while
he
lingered
here
and
cast
off
his
tacklings
he
gave
me
his
last
kiss
while
she
reviews
every
object
and
strives
to
recall
every
incident
looking
out
over
the
sea
she
descries
an
indistinct
object
floating
in
the
water
at
first
she
was
in
doubt
what
it
was
but
by
degrees
the
waves
bore
it
nearer
and
it
was
plainly
the
body
of
a
man
though
unknowing
of
whom
yet
as
it
was
of
some
shipwrecked
one
she
was
deeply
moved
and
gave
it
her
tears
saying
alas
unhappy
one
and
unhappy
if
such
there
be
thy
wife
borne
by
the
waves
it
came
nearer
as
she
more
and
more
nearly
views
it
she
trembles
more
and
more
now
now
it
approaches
the
shore
now
marks
that
she
recognizes
appear
it
is
her
husband
stretching
out
her
trembling
hands
towards
it
she
exclaims
o
dearest
husband
is
it
thus
you
return
to
me
there
was
built
out
from
the
shore
a
mole
constructed
to
break
the
assaults
of
the
sea
and
stem
its
violent
ingress
she
leaped
upon
this
barrier
and
it
was
wonderful
she
could
do
so
she
flew
and
striking
the
air
with
wings
produced
on
the
instant
skimmed
along
the
surface
of
the
water
an
unhappy
bird
as
she
flew
her
throat
poured
forth
sounds
full
of
grief
and
like
the
voice
of
one
lamenting
when
she
touched
the
mute
and
bloodless
body
she
enfolded
its
beloved
limbs
with
her
wings
and
tried
to
give
kisses
with
her
horny
beak
whether
ceyx
felt
it
or
whether
it
was
only
the
action
of
the
waves
those
who
looked
on
doubted
but
the
body
seemed
to
raise
its
head
but
indeed
he
did
feel
it
and
by
the
pitying
gods
both
of
them
were
changed
into
birds
they
mate
and
have
their
young
ones

pomona
was
of
this
class
and
no
one
excelled
her
in
love
of
the
garden
and
the
culture
of
fruit
she
cared
not
for
orests
and
rivers
but
loved
the
cultivated
country
and
trees
that
bear
delicious
apples
her
right
hand
bore
for
its
weapon
not
a
javelin
but
a
armed
with
this
she
busied
herself
at
one
time
to
repress
the
too
luxuriant
growths
and
curtail
the
branches
that
straggled
out
of
place
at
another
to
split
the
twig
and
insert
therein
a
graft
making
the

not

she
took
care
too
that
her
favorites
should
not
suffer
from
drought
and
led
streams
of
water
by
them
that
the
thirsty
roots
might
drink
this
occupation
was
her
pursuit
her
passion
and
she
was
free
from
that
which
venus
inspires
she
was
not
without
fear
of
the
country
people
and
kept
her
orchard
locked
and
allowed
not
men
to
enter
the
fauns
and
satyrs
would
have
given
all
they
possessed
to
win
her
and
so
would

looks
young
for
his

and

who
wears
a
garland
of

leaves
around
his

but
vertumnus
loved
her
best
of
all
yet
he
sped
no
better
than
the
rest
o
how
often
in
the
disguise
of
a
reaper
did
he
bring
her
corn
in
a
basket
and
looked
the
very
image
of
a
reaper
with
a
hay
band
tied
round
him
one
would
think
he
had
just
come
from
turning
over
the
grass
sometimes
he
would
have
an
in
his
hand
and
you
would
have
said
he
had
just
unyoked
his
weary
oxen
now
he
bore
a
and
personated
a
and
again
with
a
ladder
on
his
shoulder
he
seemed
as
if
he
was
going
to
gather
apples
sometimes
he
trudged
along
as
a
discharged
soldier
and
again
he
bore
a
as
if
going
to
fish
in
this
way
he
gained
admission
to
her
again
and
again
and
fed
his
passion
with
the
sight
of
her
one
day
he
came
in
the
guise
of
an
old
woman
her
gray
hair
surmounted
with
a
cap
and
a
staff
in
her
hand
she
entered
the
garden
and
admired
the
fruit
it
does
you
credit
my
dear
she
said
and
kissed
her
not
exactly
with
an
old
woman
kiss
she
sat
down
on
a
bank
and
looked
up
at
the
branches
laden
with
fruit
which
hung
over
her
opposite
was
an
elm
entwined
with
a
vine
loaded
with
swelling
grapes
she
praised
the
tree
and
its
associated
vine
equally
but
said
she
if
the
tree
stood
alone
and
had
no
vine
clinging
to
it
it
would
have
nothing
to
attract
or
offer
us
but
its
useless
leaves
and
equally
the
vine
if
it
were
not
twined
round
the
elm
would
lie
prostrate
on
the
ground
why
will
you
not
take
a
lesson
from
the
tree
and
the
vine
and
consent
to
unite
yourself
with
some
one
i
wish
you
would
helen
herself
had
not
more
numerous
suitors
nor
penelope
the
wife
of
shrewd
ulysses
even
while
you
spurn
them
they
court
you
rural
deities
and
others
of
every
kind
that
frequent
these
mountains
but
if
you
are
prudent
and
want
to
make
a
good
alliance
and
will
let
an
old
woman
advise
you
who
loves
you
better
than
you
have
any
idea
of
dismiss
all
the
rest
and
accept
vertumnus
on
my
recommendation
i
know
him
as
well
as
he
knows
himself
he
is
not
a
wandering
deity
but
belongs
to
these
mountains
nor
is
he
like
too
many
of
the
lovers
nowadays
who
love
any
one
they
happen
to
see
he
loves
you
and
you
only
add
to
this
he
is
young
and
handsome
and
has
the
art
of
assuming
any
shape
he
pleases
and
can
make
himself
just
what
you
command
him
moreover
he
loves
the
same
things
that
you
do
delights
in
gardening
and
handles
your
apples
with
admiration
but
now
he
cares
nothing
for
fruits
nor
flowers
nor
anything
else
but
only
yourself
take
pity
on
him
and
fancy
him
speaking
now
with
my
mouth
remember
that
the
gods
punish
cruelty
and
that
venus
hates
a
hard
heart
and
will
visit
such
offences
sooner
or
later
to
prove
this
let
me
tell
you
a
story
which
is
well
known
in
cyprus
to
be
a
fact
and
i
hope
it
will
have
the
effect
to
make
you
more
merciful
iphis
was
a
young
man
of
humble
parentage
who
saw
and
loved
anaxarete
a
noble
lady
of
the
ancient
family
of
teucer
he
struggled
long
with
his
passion
but
when
he
found
he
could
not
subdue
it
he
came
a
suppliant
to
her
mansion
first
he
told
his
passion
to
her
nurse
and
begged
her
as
she
loved
her
to
favor
his
suit
and
then
he
tried
to
win
her
domestics
to
his
side
sometimes
he
committed
his
vows
to
written
tablets
and
often
hung
at
her
door
garlands
which
he
had
moistened
with
his
tears
he
stretched
himself
on
her
threshold
and
uttered
his
complaints
to
the
cruel
bolts
and
bars
she
was
deafer
than
the
surges
which
rise
in
the
november
gale
harder
than
steel
from
the
german
forges
or
a
rock
that
still
clings
to
its
native
cliff
she
mocked
and
laughed
at
him
adding
cruel
words
to
her
ungentle
treatment
and
gave
not
the
slightest
gleam
of
hope
iphis
could
not
any
longer
endure
the
torments
of
hopeless
love
and
standing
before
her
doors
he
spake
these
last
words
you
have
conquered
and
shall
no
longer
have
to
bear
my
importunities
enjoy
your
triumph
sing
songs
of
joy
and
bind
your
forehead
with
laurel
you
have
conquered
i
die
stony
heart
rejoice
this
at
least
i
can
do
to
gratify
you
and
force
you
to
praise
me
and
thus
shall
i
prove
that
the
love
of
you
left
me
but
with
life
nor
will
i
leave
it
to
rumor
to
tell
you
of
my
death
i
will
come
myself
and
you
shall
see
me
die
and
feast
your
eyes
on
the
spectacle
yet
o
ye
gods
who
look
down
on
mortal
woes
observe
my
fate
i
ask
but
this
let
me
be
remembered
in
coming
ages
and
add
those
years
to
my
fame
which
you
have
reft
from
my
life
thus
he
said
and
turning
his
pale
face
and
weeping
eyes
towards
her
mansion
he
fastened
a
rope
to
the
gatepost
on
which
he
had
often
hung
garlands
and
putting
his
head
into
the
noose
he
murmured
garland
at
least
will
please
you
cruel
girl
and
falling
hung
suspended
with
his
neck
broken
as
he
fell
he
struck
against
the
gate
and
the
sound
was
as
the
sound
of
a
groan
the
servants
opened
the
door
and
found
him
dead
and
with
exclamations
of
pity
raised
him
and
carried
him
home
to
his
mother
for
his
father
was
not
living
she
received
the
dead
body
of
her
son
and
folded
the
cold
form
to
her
bosom
while
she
poured
forth
the
sad
words
which
bereaved
mothers
utter
the
mournful
funeral
passed
through
the
town
and
the
pale
corpse
was
borne
on
a
bier
to
the
place
of
the
funeral
pile
by
chance
the
home
of
anaxarete
was
on
the
street
where
the
procession
passed
and
the
lamentations
of
the
mourners
met
the
ears
of
her
whom
the
avenging
deity
had
already
marked
for
punishment
us
see
this
sad
procession
said
she
and
mounted
to
a
turret
whence
through
an
open
window
she
looked
upon
the
funeral
scarce
had
her
eyes
rested
upon
the
form
of
iphis
stretched
on
the
bier
when
they
began
to
stiffen
and
the
warm
blood
in
her
body
to
become
cold
endeavoring
to
step
back
she
found
she
could
not
move
her
feet
trying
to
turn
away
her
face
she
tried
in
vain
and
by
degrees
all
her
limbs
became
stony
like
her
heart
that
you
may
not
doubt
the
fact
the
statue
still
remains
and
stands
in
the
temple
of
venus
at
salamis
in
the
exact
form
of
the
lady
now
think
of
these
things
my
dear
and
lay
aside
your
scorn
and
your
delays
and
accept
a
lover
so
may
neither
the
vernal
frosts
blight
your
young
fruits
nor
furious
winds
scatter
your
blossoms
when
vertumnus
had
spoken
thus
he
dropped
the
disguise
of
an
old
woman
and
stood
before
her
in
his
proper
person
as
a
comely
youth
it
appeared
to
her
like
the
sun
bursting
through
a
cloud
he
would
have
renewed
his
entreaties
but
there
was
no
need
his
arguments
and
the
sight
of
his
true
form
prevailed
and
the
nymph
no
longer
resisted
but
owned
a
mutual
flame

xi
cupid
and
psyche
a
certain
king
and
queen
had
three
daughters
the
charms
of
the
two
elder
were
more
than
common
but
the
beauty
of
the
youngest
was
so
wonderful
that
the
poverty
of
language
is
unable
to
express
its
due
praise
the
fame
of
her
beauty
was
so
great
that
strangers
from
neighboring
countries
came
in
crowds
to
enjoy
the
sight
and
looked
on
her
with
amazement
paying
her
that
homage
which
is
due
only
to
venus
herself
in
fact
venus
found
her
altars
deserted
while
men
turned
their
devotion
to
this
young
virgin
as
she
passed
along
the
people
sang
her
praises
and
strewed
her
way
with
chaplets
and
flowers
this
perversion
of
homage
due
only
to
the
immortal
powers
to
the
exaltation
of
a
mortal
gave
great
offence
to
the
real
venus
shaking
her
ambrosial
locks
with
indignation
she
exclaimed
am
i
then
to
be
eclipsed
in
my
honors
by
a
mortal
girl
in
vain
then
did
that
royal
shepherd
whose
judgment
was
approved
by
jove
himself
give
me
the
palm
of
beauty
over
my
illustrious
rivals
pallas
and
juno
but
she
shall
not
so
quietly
usurp
my
honors
i
will
give
her
cause
to
repent
of
so
unlawful
a
beauty
thereupon
she
calls
her
winged
son
cupid
mischievous
enough
in
his
own
nature
and
rouses
and
provokes
him
yet
more
by
her
complaints
she
points
out
psyche
to
him
and
says
my
dear
son
punish
that
contumacious
beauty
give
thy

a
revenge
as
sweet
as
her
injuries
are
great
infuse
into
the
bosom
of
that
haughty
girl
a
passion
for
some
low
mean
unworthy
being
so
that
she
may
reap
a
mortification
as
great
as
her
present
exultation

triumph

filled
two
amber
vases
one
from

fountain
and
suspending
them
from
the
top
of
his
quiver
hastened
to
the
chamber
of
psyche
whom
he
found
asleep
he
shed
a
few
drops
from
the
bitter
fountain
over
her
lips
though
the
sight
of
her
almost
moved
him
to
pity
then
touched
her
side
with
the
point
of
his
arrow
at
the
touch
she
awoke

opened
eyes
upon

startled

wounded

whole
thought
now
was
to

king
royal
youth
nor
plebeian
presented
himself
to
demand
her
in
marriage
her
two
elder
sisters
of
moderate
charms
had
now
long
been
married
to
two
royal
princes
but
psyche
in
her
lonely
apartment
deplored
her
solitude
sick
of
that
beauty
which
while
it
procured
abundance
of
flattery
had
failed
to
awaken
love
her
parents
afraid
that
they
had
unwittingly
incurred
the
anger
of
the
gods
consulted
the
oracle
of
apollo
and
received
this
answer
the
virgin
is
destined
for
the
bride
of
no
mortal
lover
her
future
husband
awaits
her
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
he
is
a
monster
whom
neither
gods
nor
men
can
resist
this
dreadful
decree
of
the
oracle
filled
all
the
people
with
dismay
and
her
parents
abandoned
themselves
to
grief
but
psyche
said
why
my
dear
parents
do
you
now
lament
me
you
should
rather
have
grieved
when
the
people
showered
upon
me
undeserved
honors
and
with
one
voice
called
me
a
venus
i
now
perceive
that
i
am
a
victim
to
that
name
i
submit
lead
me
to
that
rock
to
which
my
unhappy
fate
has
destined
me
accordingly
all
things
being
prepared
the
royal
maid
took
her
place
in
the
procession
which
more
resembled
a
funeral
than
a
nuptial
pomp
and
with
her
parents
amid
the
lamentations
of
the
people
ascended
the
mountain
on
the
summit
of
which
they
left
her
alone
and
with
sorrowful
hearts
returned
home
while
psyche
stood
on
the
ridge
of
the
mountain
panting
with
fear
and
with
eyes
full
of
tears
the
gentle
zephyr
raised
her
from
the
earth
and
bore
her
with
an
easy
motion
into
a
flowery
dale
by
degrees
her
mind
became
composed
and
she
laid
herself
down
on
the
grassy
bank
to
sleep
when
she
awoke
refreshed
with
sleep
she
looked
round
and
beheld
near
by
a
pleasant
grove
of
tall
and
stately
trees
she
entered
it
and
in
the
midst
discovered
a
fountain
sending
forth
clear
and
crystal
waters
and
fast
by
a
magnificent
palace
whose
august
front
impressed
the
spectator
that
it
was
not
the
work
of
mortal
hands
but
the
happy
retreat
of
some
god
drawn
by
admiration
and
wonder
she
approached
the
building
and
ventured
to
enter
every
object
she
met
filled
her
with
pleasure
and
amazement
golden
pillars
supported
the
vaulted
roof
and
the
walls
were
enriched
with
carvings
and
paintings
representing
beasts
of
the
chase
and
rural
scenes
adapted
to
delight
the
eye
of
the
beholder
proceeding
onward
she
perceived
that
besides
the
apartments
of
state
there
were
others
filled
with
all
manner
of
treasures
and
beautiful
and
precious
productions
of
nature
and
art
while
her
eyes
were
thus
occupied
a
voice
addressed
her
though
she
saw
no
one
uttering
these
words
sovereign
lady
all
that
you
see
is
yours
we
whose
voices
you
hear
are
your
servants
and
shall
obey
all
your
commands
with
our
utmost
care
and
diligence
retire
therefore
to
your
chamber
and
repose
on
your
bed
of
down
and
when
you
see
fit
repair
to
the
bath
supper
awaits
you
in
the
adjoining
alcove
when
it
pleases
you
to
take
your
seat
there
psyche
gave
ear
to
the
admonitions
of
her
vocal
attendants
and
after
repose
and
the
refreshment
of
the
bath
seated
herself
in
the
alcove
where
a
table
immediately
presented
itself
without
any
visible
aid
from
waiters
or
servants
and
covered
with
the
greatest
delicacies
of
food
and
the
most
nectareous
wines
her
ears
too
were
feasted
with
music
from
invisible
performers
of
whom
one
sang
another
played
on
the
lute
and
all
closed
in
the
wonderful
harmony
of
a
full
chorus
she
had
not
yet
seen
her
destined
husband
he
came
only
in
the
hours
of
darkness
and
fled
before
the
dawn
of
morning
but
his
accents
were
full
of
love
and
inspired
a
like
passion
in
her
she
often
begged
him
to
stay
and
let
her
behold
him
but
he
would
not
consent
on
the
contrary
he
charged
her
to
make
no
attempt
to
see
him
for
it
was
his
pleasure
for
the
best
of
reasons
to
keep
concealed
why
should
you
wish
to
behold
me
he
said
have
you
any
doubt
of
my
love
have
you
any
wish
ungratified
if
you
saw
me
perhaps
you
would
fear
me
perhaps
adore
me
but
all
i
ask
of
you
is
to
love
me
i
would
rather
you
would
love
me
as
an
equal
than
adore
me
as
a
god
this
reasoning
somewhat
quieted
psyche
for
a
time
and
while
the
novelty
lasted
she
felt
quite
happy
but
at
length
the
thought
of
her
parents
left
in
ignorance
of
her
fate
and
of
her
sisters
precluded
from
sharing
with
her
the
delights
of
her
situation
preyed
on
her
mind
and
made
her
begin
to
feel
her
palace
as
but
a
splendid
prison
when
her
husband
came
one
night
she
told
him
her
distress
and
at
last
drew
from
him
an
unwilling
consent
that
her
sisters
should
be
brought
to
see
her
so
calling
zephyr
she
acquainted
him
with
her
commands
and
he
promptly
obedient
soon
brought
them
across
the
mountain
down
to
their
sister
valley
they
embraced
her
and
she
returned
their
caresses
come
said
psyche
enter
with
me
my
house
and
refresh
yourselves
with
whatever
your
sister
has
to
offer
then
taking
their
hands
she
led
them
into
her
golden
palace
and
committed
them
to
the
care
of
her
numerous
train
of
attendant
voices
to
refresh
them
in
her
baths
and
at
her
table
and
to
show
them
all
her
treasures
the
view
of
these
celestial
delights
caused
envy
to
enter
their
bosoms
at
seeing
their
young
sister
possessed
of
such
state
and
splendor
so
much
exceeding
their
own
they
asked
her
numberless
questions
among
others
what
sort
of
a
person
her
husband
was
psyche
replied
that
he
was
a
beautiful
youth
who
generally
spent
the
daytime
in
hunting
upon
the
mountains
the
sisters
not
satisfied
with
this
reply
soon
made
her
confess
that
she
had
never
seen
him
then
they
proceeded
to
fill
her
bosom
with
dark
suspicions
call
to
mind
they
said
the
pythian
oracle
that
declared
you
destined
to
marry
a
direful
and
tremendous
monster
the
inhabitants
of
this
valley
say
that
your
husband
is
a
terrible
and
monstrous
serpent
who
nourishes
you
for
a
while
with
dainties
that
he
may
by
and
by
devour
you
take
our
advice
provide
yourself
with
a
lamp
and
a
sharp
knife
put
them
in
concealment
that
your
husband
may
not
discover
them
and
when
he
is
sound
asleep
slip
out
of
bed
bring
forth
your
lamp
and
see
for
yourself
whether
what
they
say
is
true
or
not
if
it
is
hesitate
not
to
cut
off
the
monster
head
and
thereby
recover
your
liberty
psyche
resisted
these
persuasions
as
well
as
she
could
but
they
did
not
fail
to
have
their
effect
on
her
mind
and
when
her
sisters
were
gone
their
words
and
her
own
curiosity
were
too
strong
for
her
to
resist
so
she
prepared
her
lamp
and
a
sharp
knife
and
hid
them
out
of
sight
of
her
husband
when
he
had
fallen
into
his
first
sleep
she
silently
rose
and
uncovering
her
lamp
beheld
not
a
hideous
monster
but
the
most
beautiful
and
charming
of
the
gods
with
his
golden
ringlets
wandering
over
his
snowy
neck
and
crimson
cheek
with
two
dewy
wings
on
his
shoulders
whiter
than
snow
and
with
shining
feathers
like
the
tender
blossoms
of
spring
as
she
leaned
the
lamp
over
to
have
a
nearer
view
of
his
face
a
drop
of
burning
oil
fell
on
the
shoulder
of
the
god
startled
with
which
he
opened
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
full
upon
her
then
without
saying
one
word
he
spread
his
white
wings
and
flew
out
of
the
window
psyche
in
vain
endeavoring
to
follow
him
fell
from
the
window
to
the
ground
cupid
beholding
her
as
she
lay
in
the
dust
stopped
his
flight
for
an
instant
and
said
o
foolish
psyche
is
it
thus
you
repay
my
love
after
having
disobeyed
my
mother
commands
and
made
you
my
wife
will
you
think
me
a
monster
and
cut
off
my
head
but
go
return
to
your
sisters
whose
advice
you
seem
to
think
preferable
to
mine
i
inflict
no
other
punishment
on
you
than
to
leave
you
forever
love
can
not
dwell
with
suspicion
so
saying
he
fled
away
leaving
poor
psyche
prostrate
on
the
ground
filling
the
place
with
mournful
lamentations
when
she
had
recovered
some
degree
of
composure
she
looked
around
her
but
the
palace
and
gardens
had
vanished
and
she
found
herself
in
the
open
field
not
far
from
the
city
where
her
sisters
dwelt
she
repaired
thither
and
told
them
the
whole
story
of
her
misfortunes
at
which
pretending
to
grieve
those
spiteful
creatures
inwardly
rejoiced
for
now
said
they
he
will
perhaps
choose
one
of
us
with
this
idea
without
saying
a
word
of
her
intentions
each
of
them
rose
early
the
next
morning
and
ascended
the
mountains
and
having
reached
the
top
called
upon
zephyr
to
receive
her
and
bear
her
to
his
lord
then
leaping
up
and
not
being
sustained
by
zephyr
fell
down
the
precipice
and
was
dashed
to
pieces
psyche
meanwhile
wandered
day
and
night
without
food
or
repose
in
search
of
her
husband
casting
her
eyes
on
a
lofty
mountain
having
on
its
brow
a
magnificent
temple
she
sighed
and
said
to
herself
perhaps
my
love
my
lord
inhabits
there
and
directed
her
steps
thither
she
had
no
sooner
entered
than
she
saw
heaps
of
corn
some
in
loose
ears
and
some
in
sheaves
with
mingled
ears
of
barley
scattered
about
lay
sickles
and
rakes
and
all
the
instruments
of
harvest
without
order
as
if
thrown
carelessly
out
of
the
weary
reapers
hands
in
the
sultry
hours
of
the
day
this
unseemly
confusion
the
pious
psyche
put
an
end
to
by
separating
and
sorting
everything
to
its
proper
place
and
kind
believing
that
she
ought
to
neglect
none
of
the
gods
but
endeavor
by
her
piety
to
engage
them
all
in
her
behalf
the
holy
ceres
whose
temple
it
was
finding
her
so
religiously
employed
thus
spoke
to
her
o
psyche
truly
worthy
of
our
pity
though
i
can
not
shield
you
from
the
frowns
of
venus
yet
i
can
teach
you
how
best
to
allay
her
displeasure
go
then
and
voluntarily
surrender
yourself
to
your
lady
and
sovereign
and
try
by
modesty
and
submission
to
win
her
forgiveness
and
perhaps
her
favor
will
restore
you
the
husband
you
have
lost
psyche
obeyed
the
commands
of
ceres
and
took
her
way
to
the
temple
of
venus
endeavoring
to
fortify
her
mind
and
ruminating
on
what
she
should
say
and
how
best
propitiate
the
angry
goddess
feeling
that
the
issue
was
doubtful
and
perhaps
fatal
venus
received
her
with
angry
countenance
most
undutiful
and
faithless
of
servants
said
she
do
you
at
last
remember
that
you
really
have
a
mistress
or
have
you
rather
come
to
see
your
sick
husband
yet
laid
up
of
the
wound
given
him
by
his
loving
wife
you
are
so
and
disagreeable
that
the
only
way
you
can
merit
your
lover
must
be
by
dint
of
industry
and
diligence
i
will
make
trial
of
your
housewifery
then
she
ordered
psyche
to
be
led
to
the
storehouse
of
her
temple
where
was
laid
up
a
great
quantity
of
wheat
barley
millet
vetches
beans
and
lentils
prepared
for
food
for
her
pigeons
and
said
take
and
separate
all
these
grains
putting
all
of
the
same
kind
in
a
parcel
by
themselves
and
see
that
you
get
it
done
before
evening
then
venus
departed
and
left
her
to
her
task
but
psyche
in
a
perfect
consternation
at
the
enormous
work
sat
stupid
and
silent
without
moving
a
finger
to
the
inextricable
heap
while
she
sat
despairing
cupid
stirred
up
the
little
ant
a
native
of
the
fields
to
take
compassion
on
her
the
leader
of
the
ant
hill
followed
by
whole
hosts
of
his
subjects
approached
the
heap
and
with
the
utmost
diligence
taking
grain
by
grain
they
separated
the
pile
sorting
each
kind
to
its
parcel
and
when
it
was
all
done
they
vanished
out
of
sight
in
a
moment
venus
at
the
approach
of
twilight
returned
from
the
banquet
of
the
gods
breathing
odors
and
crowned
with
roses
seeing
the
task
done
she
exclaimed
this
is
no
work
of
yours
wicked
one
but
his
whom
to
your
own
and
his
misfortune
you
have
enticed
so
saying
she
threw
her
a
piece
of
black
bread
for
her
supper
and
went
away
next
morning
venus
ordered
psyche
to
be
called
and
said
to
her
behold
yonder
grove
which
stretches
along
the
margin
of
the
water
there
you
will
find
sheep
feeding
without
a
shepherd
with
fleeces
on
their
backs
go
fetch
me
a
sample
of
that
precious
wool
gathered
from
every
one
of
their
fleeces
psyche
obediently
went
to
the
riverside
prepared
to
do
her
best
to
execute
the
command
but
the
river
god
inspired
the
reeds
with
harmonious
murmurs
which
seemed
to
say
o
maiden
severely
tried
tempt
not
the
dangerous
flood
nor
venture
among
the
formidable
rams
on
the
other
side
for
as
long
as
they
are
under
the
influence
of
the
rising
sun
they
burn
with
a
cruel
rage
to
destroy
mortals
with
their
sharp
horns
or
rude
teeth
but
when
the
noontide
sun
has
driven
the
cattle
to
the
shade
and
the
serene
spirit
of
the
flood
has
lulled
them
to
rest
you
may
then
cross
in
safety
and
you
will
find
the
woolly
gold
sticking
to
the
bushes
and
the
trunks
of
the
trees
thus
the
compassionate
river
god
gave
psyche
instructions
how
to
accomplish
her
task
and
by
observing
his
directions
she
soon
returned
to
venus
with
her
arms
full
of
the
golden
fleece
but
she
received
not
the
approbation
of
her
implacable
mistress
who
said
i
know
very
well
it
is
by
none
of
your
own
doings
that
you
have
succeeded
in
this
task
and
i
am
not
satisfied
yet
that
you
have
any
capacity
to
make
yourself
useful
but
i
have
another
task
for
you
here
take
this
box
and
go
your
way
to
the
infernal
shades
and
give
this
box
to
proserpine
and
say
mistress
venus
desires
you
to
send
her
a
little
of
your
beauty
for
in
tending
her
sick
son
she
has
lost
some
of
her
own
be
not
too
long
on
your
errand
for
i
must
paint
myself
with
it
to
appear
at
the
circle
of
the
gods
and
goddesses
this
evening
psyche
was
now
satisfied
that
her
destruction
was
at
hand
being
obliged
to
go
with
her
own
feet
directly
down
to
erebus
wherefore
to
make
no
delay
of
what
was
not
to
be
avoided
she
goes
to
the
top
of
a
high
tower
to
precipitate
herself
headlong
thus
to
descend
the
shortest
way
to
the
shades
below
but
a
voice
from
the
tower
said
to
her
why
poor
unlucky
girl
dost
thou
design
to
put
an
end
to
thy
days
in
so
dreadful
a
manner
and
what
cowardice
makes
thee
sink
under
this
last
danger
who
hast
been
so
miraculously
supported
in
all
thy
former
then
the
voice
told
her
how
by
a
certain
cave
she
might
reach
the
realms
of
pluto
and
how
to
avoid
all
the
dangers
of
the
road
to
pass
by
cerberus
the
dog
and
prevail
on
charon
the
ferryman
to
take
her
across
the
black
river
and
bring
her
back
again
but
the
voice
added
when
proserpine
has
given
you
the
box
filled
with
her
beauty
of
all
things
this
is
chiefly
to
be
observed
by
you
that
you
never
once
open
or
look
into
the
box
nor
allow
your
curiosity
to
pry
into
the
treasure
of
the
beauty
of
the
goddesses
psyche
encouraged
by
this
advice
obeyed
it
in
all
things
and
taking
heed
to
her
ways
travelled
safely
to
the
kingdom
of
pluto
she
was
admitted
to
the
palace
of
proserpine
and
without
accepting
the
delicate
seat
or
delicious
banquet
that
was
offered
her
but
contented
with
coarse
bread
for
her
food
she
delivered
her
message
from
venus
presently
the
box
was
returned
to
her
shut
and
filled
with
the
precious
commodity
then
she
returned
the
way
she
came
and
glad
was
she
to
come
out
once
more
into
the
light
of
day
but
having
got
so
far
successfully
through
her
dangerous
task
a
longing
desire
seized
her
to
examine
the
contents
of
the
box
what
said
she
shall
i
the
carrier
of
this
divine
beauty
not
take
the
least
bit
to
put
on
my
cheeks
to
appear
to
more
advantage
in
the
eyes
of
my
beloved
husband
so
she
carefully
opened
the
box
but
found
nothing
there
of
any
beauty
at
all
but
an
infernal
and
truly
stygian
sleep
which
being
thus
set
free
from
its
prison
took
possession
of
her
and
she
fell
down
in
the
midst
of
the
road
a
sleepy
corpse
without
sense
or
motion
but
cupid
being
now
recovered
from
his
wound
and
not
able
longer
to
bear
the
absence
of
his
beloved
psyche
slipping
through
the
smallest
crack
of
the
window
of
his
chamber
which
happened
to
be
left
open
flew
to
the
spot
where
psyche
lay
and
gathering
up
the
sleep
from
her
body
closed
it
again
in
the
box
and
waked
psyche
with
a
light
touch
of
one
of
his
arrows
again
said
he
hast
thou
almost
perished
by
the
same
curiosity
but
now
perform
exactly
the
task
imposed
on
you
by
my
mother
and
i
will
take
care
of
the
rest
then
cupid
as
swift
as
lightning
penetrating
the
heights
of
heaven
presented
himself
before
jupiter
with
his
supplication
jupiter
lent
a
favoring
ear
and
pleaded
the
cause
of
the
lovers
so
earnestly
with
venus
that
he
won
her
consent
on
this
he
sent
mercury
to
bring
psyche
up
to
the
heavenly
assembly
and
when
she
arrived
handing
her
a
cup
of
ambrosia
he
said
drink
this
psyche
and
be
immortal
nor
shall
cupid
ever
break
away
from
the
knot
in
which
he
is
tied
but
these
nuptials
shall
be
perpetual
thus
psyche
became
at
last
united
to
cupid
and
in
due
time
they
had
a
daughter
born
to
them
whose
name
was
pleasure
the
fable
of
cupid
and
psyche
is
usually
considered
allegorical
the
greek
name
for
a
butterfly
is
psyche
and
the
same
word
means
the
soul
there
is
no
illustration
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
so
striking
and
beautiful
as
the
butterfly
bursting
on
brilliant
wings
from
the
tomb
in
which
it
has
lain
after
a
dull
grovelling
caterpillar
existence
to
flutter
in
the
blaze
of
day
and
feed
on
the
most
fragrant
and
delicate
productions
of
the
spring
psyche
then
is
the
human
soul
which
is
purified
by
sufferings
and
misfortunes
and
is
thus
prepared
for
the
enjoyment
of
true
and
pure
happiness
in
works
of
art
psyche
is
represented
as
a
maiden
with
the
wings
of
a
butterfly
along
with
cupid
in
the
different
situations
described
in
the
allegory
milton
alludes
to
the
story
of
cupid
and
psyche
in
the
conclusion
of
his
comus
celestial
cupid
her
famed
son
advanced
holds
his
dear
psyche
sweet
entranced
after
her
wandering
labors
long
till
free
consent
the
gods
among
make
her
his
eternal
bride
and
from
her
fair
unspotted
side
two
blissful
twins
are
to
be
born
youth
and
joy
so
jove
hath
sworn
the
allegory
of
the
story
of
cupid
and
psyche
is
well
presented
in
the
beautiful
lines
of
harvey
they
wove
bright
fables
in
the
days
of
old
when
reason
borrowed
fancy
painted
wings
when
truth
clear
river
flowed
sands
of
gold
and
told
in
song
its
high
and
mystic
things
and
such
the
sweet
and
solemn
tale
of
her
the
pilgrim
heart
to
whom
a
dream
was
given
that
led
her
through
the
world
love
worshipper
to
seek
on
earth
for
him
whose
home
was
heaven
in
the
full
city
by
the
haunted
fount
through
the
dim
grotto
tracery
of
spars
the
pine
temples
on
the
moonlit
mount
where
silence
sits
to
listen
to
the
stars
in
the
deep
glade
where
dwells
the
brooding
dove
the
painted
valley
and
the
scented
air
she
heard
far
echoes
of
the
voice
of
love
and
found
his
footsteps
traces
everywhere
but
nevermore
they
met
since
doubts
and
fears
those
phantom
shapes
that
haunt
and
blight
the
earth
had
come
her
a
child
of
sin
and
tears
and
that
bright
spirit
of
immortal
birth
until
her
pining
soul
and
weeping
eyes
had
learned
to
seek
him
only
in
the
skies
till
wings
unto
the
weary
heart
were
given
and
she
became
love
angel
bride
in
heaven
the
story
of
cupid
and
psyche
first
appears
in
the
works
of
apuleius
a
writer
of
the
second
century
of
our
era
it
is
therefore
of
much
more
recent
date
than
most
of
the
legends
of
the
age
of

it
is
this
that

to
in

here
chapter
xii
cadmus
the
myrmidons
jupiter
under
the
disguise
of
a
bull
had
carried
away
europa
the
daughter
of
agenor
king
of
phoenicia
agenor
commanded
his
son
cadmus
to
go
in
search
of
his
sister
and
not
to
return
without
her
cadmus
went
and
sought
long
and
far
for
his
sister
but
could
not
find
her
and
not
daring
to
return
unsuccessful
consulted
the
oracle
of
apollo
to
know
what
country
he
should
settle
in
the
oracle
informed
him
that
he
should
find
a
cow
in
the
field
and
should
follow
her
wherever
she
might
wander
and
where
she
stopped
should
build
a
city
and
call
it
thebes
cadmus
had
hardly
left
the
castalian
cave
from
which
the
oracle
was
delivered
when
he
saw
a
young
cow
slowly
walking
before
him
he
followed
her
close
offering
at
the
same
time
his
prayers
to
phoebus
the
cow
went
on
till
she
passed
the
shallow
channel
of
cephisus
and
came
out
into
the
plain
of
panope
there
she
stood
still
and
raising
her
broad
forehead
to
the
sky
filled
the
air
with
her
lowings
cadmus
gave
thanks
and
stooping
down
kissed
the
foreign
soil
then
lifting
his
eyes
greeted
the
surrounding
mountains
wishing
to
offer
a
sacrifice
to
jupiter
he
sent
his
servants
to
seek
pure
water
for
a
libation
near
by
there
stood
an
ancient
grove
which
had
never
been
profaned
by
the
axe
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
cave
thick
covered
with
the
growth
of
bushes
its
roof
forming
a
low
arch
from
beneath
which
burst
forth
a
fountain
of
purest
water
in
the
cave
lurked
a
horrid
serpent
with
a
crested
head
and
scales
glittering
like
gold
his
eyes
shone
like
fire
his
body
was
swollen
with
venom
he
vibrated
a
triple
tongue
and
showed
a
triple
row
of
teeth
no
sooner
had
the
tyrians
dipped
their
pitchers
in
the
fountain
and
the
gushing
waters
made
a
sound
than
the
glittering
serpent
raised
his
head
out
of
the
cave
and
uttered
a
fearful
hiss
the
vessels
fell
from
their
hands
the
blood
left
their
cheeks
they
trembled
in
every
limb
the
serpent
twisting
his
scaly
body
in
a
huge
coil
raised
his
head
so
as
to
overtop
the
tallest
trees
and
while
the
tyrians
from
terror
could
neither
fight
nor
fly
slew
some
with
his
fangs
others
in
his
folds
and
others
with
his
poisonous
breath
cadmus
having
waited
for
the
return
of
his
men
till
midday
went
in
search
of
them
his
covering
was
a
lion
hide
and
besides
his
javelin
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
lance
and
in
his
breast
a
bold
heart
a
surer
reliance
than
either
when
he
entered
the
wood
and
saw
the
lifeless
bodies
of
his
men
and
the
monster
with
his
bloody
jaws
he
exclaimed
o
faithful
friends
i
will
avenge
you
or
share
your
death
so
saying
he
lifted
a
huge
stone
and
threw
it
with
all
his
force
at
the
serpent
such
a
block
would
have
shaken
the
wall
of
a
fortress
but
it
made
no
impression
on
the
monster
cadmus
next
threw
his
javelin
which
met
with
better
success
for
it
penetrated
the
serpent
scales
and
pierced
through
to
his
entrails
fierce
with
pain
the
monster
turned
back
his
head
to
view
the
wound
and
attempted
to
draw
out
the
weapon
with
his
mouth
but
broke
it
off
leaving
the
iron
point
rankling
in
his
flesh
his
neck
swelled
with
rage
bloody
foam
covered
his
jaws
and
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
poisoned
the
air
around
now
he
twisted
himself
into
a
circle
then
stretched
himself
out
on
the
ground
like
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
as
he
moved
onward
cadmus
retreated
before
him
holding
his
spear
opposite
to
the
monster
opened
jaws
the
serpent
snapped
at
the
weapon
and
attempted
to
bite
its
iron
point
at
last
cadmus
watching
his
chance
thrust
the
spear
at
a
moment
when
the
animal
head
thrown
back
came
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
and
so
succeeded
in
pinning
him
to
its
side
his
weight
bent
the
tree
as
he
struggled
in
the
agonies
of
death
while
cadmus
stood
over
his
conquered
foe
contemplating
its
vast
size
a
voice
was
heard
from
whence
he
knew
not
but
he
heard
it
distinctly
commanding
him
to
take
the
dragon
teeth
and
sow
them
in
the
earth
he
obeyed
he
made
a
furrow
in
the
ground
and
planted
the
teeth
destined
to
produce
a
crop
of
men
scarce
had
he
done
so
when
the
clods
began
to
move
and
the
points
of
spears
to
appear
above
the
surface
next
helmets
with
their
nodding
plumes
came
up
and
next
the
shoulders
and
breasts
and
limbs
of
men
with
weapons
and
in
time
a
harvest
of
armed
warriors
cadmus
alarmed
prepared
to
encounter
a
new
enemy
but
one
of
them
said
to
him
meddle
not
with
our
civil
war
with
that
he
who
had
spoken
smote
one
of
his
brothers
with
a
sword
and
he
himself
fell
pierced
with
an
arrow
from
another
the
latter
fell
victim
to
a
fourth
and
in
like
manner
the
whole
crowd
dealt
with
each
other
till
all
fell
slain
with
mutual
wounds
except
five
survivors
one
of
these
cast
away
his
weapons
and
said
brothers
let
us
live
in
peace
these
five
joined
with
cadmus
in
building
his
city
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
thebes
cadmus
obtained
in
marriage
harmonia
the
daughter
of
venus
the
gods
left
olympus
to
honor
the
occasion
with
their
presence
and
vulcan
presented
the
bride
with
a
necklace
of
surpassing
brilliancy
his
own
workmanship
but
a
fatality
hung
over
the
family
of
cadmus
in
consequence
of
his
killing
the
serpent
sacred
to
mars
semele
and
ino
his
daughters
and
actaeon
and
pentheus
his
grandchildren
all
perished
unhappily
and
cadmus
and
harmonia
quitted
thebes
now
grown
odious
to
them
and
emigrated
to
the
country
of
the
enchelians
who
received
them
with
honor
and
made
cadmus
their
king
but
the
misfortunes
of
their
children
still
weighed
upon
their
minds
and
one
day
cadmus
exclaimed
if
a
serpent
life
is
so
dear
to
the
gods
i
would
i
were
myself
a
serpent
no
sooner
had
he
uttered
the
words
than
he
began
to
change
his
form
harmonia
beheld
it
and
prayed
to
the
gods
to
let
her
share
his
fate
both
became
serpents
they
live
in
the
woods
but
mindful
of
their
origin
they
neither
avoid
the
presence
of
man
nor
do
they
ever
injure
any
one
there
is
a
tradition
that
cadmus
introduced
into
greece
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
which
were
invented
by
the
phoenicians
this
is
alluded
to
by
byron
where
addressing
the
modern
greeks
he
says
you
have
the
letters
cadmus
gave
think
you
he
meant
them
for
a
slave
milton
describing
the
serpent
which
tempted
eve
is
reminded
of
the
serpents
of
the
classical
stories
and
says
pleasing
was
his
shape
and
lovely
never
since
of
serpent
kind
lovelier
not
those
that
in
illyria
changed
hermione
and
cadmus
nor
the
god
in
epidaurus
for
an
explanation
of
the
last
allusion
see
oracle
of
aesculapius
the
myrmidons
the
myrmidons
were
the
soldiers
of
achilles
in
the
trojan
war
from
them
all
zealous
and
unscrupulous
followers
of
a
political
chief
are
called
by
that
name
down
to
this
day
but
the
origin
of
the
myrmidons
would
not
give
one
the
idea
of
a
fierce
and
bloody
race
but
rather
of
a
laborious
and
peaceful
one
cephalus
king
of
athens
arrived
in
the
island
of
aegina
to
seek
assistance
of
his
old
friend
and
ally
aeacus
the
king
in
his
war
with
minos
king
of
crete
cephalus
was
most
kindly
received
and
the
desired
assistance
readily
promised
i
have
people
enough
said
aeacus
to
protect
myself
and
spare
you
such
a
force
as
you
need
i
rejoice
to
see
it
replied
cephalus
and
my
wonder
has
been
raised
i
confess
to
find
such
a
host
of
youths
as
i
see
around
me
all
apparently
of
about
the
same
age
yet
there
are
many
individuals
whom
i
previously
knew
that
i
look
for
now
in
vain
what
has
become
of
them
aeacus
groaned
and
replied
with
a
voice
of
sadness
i
have
been
intending
to
tell
you
and
will
now
do
so
without
more
delay
that
you
may
see
how
from
the
saddest
beginning
a
happy
result
sometimes
flows
those
whom
you
formerly
knew
are
now
dust
and
ashes
a
plague
sent
by
angry
juno
devastated
the
land
she
hated
it
because
it
bore
the
name
of
one
of
her
husband
female
favorites
while
the
disease
appeared
to
spring
from
natural
causes
we
resisted
it
as
we
best
might
by
natural
remedies
but
it
soon
appeared
that
the
pestilence
was
too
powerful
for
our
efforts
and
we
yielded
at
the
beginning
the
sky
seemed
to
settle
down
upon
the
earth
and
thick
clouds
shut
in
the
heated
air
for
four
months
together
a
deadly
south
wind
prevailed
the
disorder
affected
the
wells
and
springs
thousands
of
snakes
crept
over
the
land
and
shed
their
poison
in
the
fountains
the
force
of
the
disease
was
first
spent
on
the
lower
animals
dogs
cattle
sheep
and
birds
the
luckless
ploughman
wondered
to
see
his
oxen
fall
in
the
midst
of
their
work
and
lie
helpless
in
the
unfinished
furrow
the
wool
fell
from
the
bleating
sheep
and
their
bodies
pined
away
the
horse
once
foremost
in
the
race
contested
the
palm
no
more
but
groaned
at
his
stall
and
died
an
inglorious
death
the
wild
boar
forgot
his
rage
the
stag
his
swiftness
the
bears
no
longer
attacked
the
herds
everything
languished
dead
bodies
lay
in
the
roads
the
fields
and
the
woods
the
air
was
poisoned
by
them
i
tell
you
what
is
hardly
credible
but
neither
dogs
nor
birds
would
touch
them
nor
starving
wolves
their
decay
spread
the
infection
next
the
disease
attacked
the
country
people
and
then
the
dwellers
in
the
city
at
first
the
cheek
was
flushed
and
the
breath
drawn
with
difficulty
the
tongue
grew
rough
and
swelled
and
the
dry
mouth
stood
open
with
its
veins
enlarged
and
gasped
for
the
air
men
could
not
bear
the
heat
of
their
clothes
or
their
beds
but
preferred
to
lie
on
the
bare
ground
and
the
ground
did
not
cool
them
but
on
the
contrary
they
heated
the
spot
where
they
lay
nor
could
the
physicians
help
for
the
disease
attacked
them
also
and
the
contact
of
the
sick
gave
them
infection
so
that
the
most
faithful
were
the
first
victims
at
last
all
hope
of
relief
vanished
and
men
learned
to
look
upon
death
as
the
only
deliverer
from
disease
then
they
gave
way
to
every
inclination
and
cared
not
to
ask
what
was
expedient
for
nothing
was
expedient
all
restraint
laid
aside
they
crowded
around
the
wells
and
fountains
and
drank
till
they
died
without
quenching
thirst
many
had
not
strength
to
get
away
from
the
water
but
died
in
the
midst
of
the
stream
and
others
would
drink
of
it
notwithstanding
such
was
their
weariness
of
their
sick
beds
that
some
would
creep
forth
and
if
not
strong
enough
to
stand
would
die
on
the
ground
they
seemed
to
hate
their
friends
and
got
away
from
their
homes
as
if
not
knowing
the
cause
of
their
sickness
they
charged
it
on
the
place
of
their
abode
some
were
seen
tottering
along
the
road
as
long
as
they
could
stand
while
others
sank
on
the
earth
and
turned
their
dying
eyes
around
to
take
a
last
look
then
closed
them
in
death
what
heart
had
i
left
me
during
all
this
or
what
ought
i
to
have
had
except
to
hate
life
and
wish
to
be
with
my
dead
subjects
on
all
sides
lay
my
people
strewn
like
apples
beneath
the
tree
or
acorns
under
the
oak
you
see
yonder
a
temple
on
the
height
it
is
sacred
to
jupiter
o
how
many
offered
prayers
there
husbands
for
wives
fathers
for
sons
and
died
in
the
very
act
of
supplication
how
often
while
the
priest
made
ready
for
sacrifice
the
victim
fell
struck
down
by
disease
without
waiting
for
the
blow
at
length
all
reverence
for
sacred
things
was
lost
bodies
were
thrown
out
unburied
wood
was
wanting
for
funeral
piles
men
fought
with
one
another
for
the
possession
of
them
finally
there
were
none
left
to
mourn
sons
and
husbands
old
men
and
youths
perished
alike
unlamented
standing
before
the
altar
i
raised
my
eyes
to
heaven
jupiter
i
said
thou
art
indeed
my
father
and
art
not
ashamed
of
thy
offspring
give
me
back
my
people
or
take
me
also
away
at
these
words
a
clap
of
thunder
was
heard
accept
the
omen
i
cried
may
it
be
a
sign
of
a
favorable
disposition
towards
me
by
chance
there
grew
by
the
place
where
i
stood
an
oak
with
branches
sacred
to
jupiter
i
observed
a
troop
of
ants
busy
with
their
labor
carrying
minute
grains
in
their
mouths
and
following
one
another
in
a
line
up
the
trunk
of
the
tree
observing
their
numbers
with
admiration
i
said
me
o
father
citizens
as
numerous
as
these
and
replenish
my
empty
city
the
tree
shook
and
gave
a
rustling
sound
with
its
branches
though
no
wind
agitated
them
i
trembled
in
every
limb
yet
i
kissed
the
earth
and
the
tree
i
would
not
confess
to
myself
that
i
hoped
yet
i
did
hope
night
came
on
and
sleep
took
possession
of
my
frame
oppressed
with
cares
the
tree
stood
before
me
in
my
dreams
with
its
numerous
branches
all
covered
with
living
moving
creatures
it
seemed
to
shake
its
limbs
and
throw
down
over
the
ground
a
multitude
of
those
industrious
gathering
animals
which
appeared
to
gain
in
size
and
grow
larger
and
larger
and
by
and
by
to
stand
erect
lay
aside
their
superfluous
legs
and
their
black
color
and
finally
to
assume
the
human
form
then
i
awoke
and
my
first
impulse
was
to
chide
the
gods
who
had
robbed
me
of
a
sweet
vision
and
given
me
no
reality
in
its
place
being
still
in
the
temple
my
attention
was
caught
by
the
sound
of
many
voices
without
a
sound
of
late
unusual
to
my
ears
while
i
began
to
think
i
was
yet
dreaming
telamon
my
son
throwing
open
the
temple
gates
exclaimed
approach
and
behold
things
surpassing
even
your
hopes
i
went
forth
i
saw
a
multitude
of
men
such
as
i
had
seen
in
my
dream
and
they
were
passing
in
procession
in
the
same
manner
while
i
gazed
with
wonder
and
delight
they
approached
and
kneeling
hailed
me
as
their
king
i
paid
my
vows
to
jove
and
proceeded
to
allot
the
vacant
city
to
the
race
and
to
parcel
out
the
fields
among
them
i
called
them
myrmidons
from
the
ant
myrmex
from
which
they
sprang
you
have
seen
these
persons
their
dispositions
resemble
those
which
they
had
in
their
former
shape
they
are
a
diligent
and
industrious
race
eager
to
gain
and
tenacious
of
their
gains
among
them
you
may
recruit
your
forces
they
will
follow
you
to
the
war
young
in
years
and
bold
in
heart

and

chapter
xiii
nisus
and
scylla
echo
and
narcissus
clytie
hero
and
leander
nisus
and
scylla
minos
king
of
crete
made
war
upon
megara
nisus
was
king
of
megara
and
scylla
was
his
daughter
the
siege
had
now
lasted
six
months
and
the
city
still
held
out
for
it
was
decreed
by
fate
that
it
should
not
be
taken
so
long
as
a
certain
purple
lock
which
glittered
among
the
hair
of
king
nisus
remained
on
his
head
there
was
a
tower
on
the
city
walls
which
overlooked
the
plain
where
minos
and
his
army
were
encamped
to
this
tower
scylla
used
to
repair
and
look
abroad
over
the
tents
of
the
hostile
army
the
siege
had
lasted
so
long
that
she
had
learned
to
distinguish
the
persons
of
the
leaders
minos
in
particular
excited
her
admiration
arrayed
in
his
helmet
and
bearing
his
shield
she
admired
his
graceful
deportment
if
he
threw
his
javelin
skill
seemed
combined
with
force
in
the
discharge
if
he
drew
his
bow
apollo
himself
could
not
have
done
it
more
gracefully
but
when
he
laid
aside
his
helmet
and
in
his
purple
robes
bestrode
his
white
horse
with
its
gay
caparisons
and
reined
in
its
foaming
mouth
the
daughter
of
nisus
was
hardly
mistress
of
herself
she
was
almost
frantic
with
admiration
she
envied
the
weapon
that
he
grasped
the
reins
that
he
held
she
felt
as
if
she
could
if
it
were
possible
go
to
him
through
the
hostile
ranks
she
felt
an
impulse
to
cast
herself
down
from
the
tower
into
the
midst
of
his
camp
or
to
open
the
gates
to
him
or
to
do
anything
else
so
only
it
might
gratify
minos
as
she
sat
in
the
tower
she
talked
thus
with
herself
i
know
not
whether
to
rejoice
or
grieve
at
this
sad
war
i
grieve
that
minos
is
our
enemy
but
i
rejoice
at
any
cause
that
brings
him
to
my
sight
perhaps
he
would
be
willing
to
grant
us
peace
and
receive
me
as
a
hostage
i
would
fly
down
if
i
could
and
alight
in
his
camp
and
tell
him
that
we
yield
ourselves
to
his
mercy
but
then
to
betray
my
father
no
rather
would
i
never
see
minos
again
and
yet
no
doubt
it
is
sometimes
the
best
thing
for
a
city
to
be
conquered
when
the
conqueror
is
clement
and
generous
minos
certainly
has
right
on
his
side
i
think
we
shall
be
conquered
and
if
that
must
be
the
end
of
it
why
should
not
love
unbar
the
gates
to
him
instead
of
leaving
it
to
be
done
by
war
better
spare
delay
and
slaughter
if
we
can
and
o
if
any
one
should
wound
or
kill
minos
no
one
surely
would
have
the
heart
to
do
it
yet
ignorantly
not
knowing
him
one
might
i
will
i
will
surrender
myself
to
him
with
my
country
as
a
dowry
and
so
put
an
end
to
the
war
but
how
the
gates
are
guarded
and
my
father
keeps
the
keys
he
only
stands
in
my
way
o
that
it
might
please
the
gods
to
take
him
away
but
why
ask
the
gods
to
do
it
another
woman
loving
as
i
do
would
remove
with
her
own
hands
whatever
stood
in
the
way
of
her
love
and
can
any
other
woman
dare
more
than
i
i
would
encounter
fire
and
sword
to
gain
my
object
but
here
there
is
no
need
of
fire
and
sword
i
only
need
my
father
purple
lock
more
precious
than
gold
to
me
that
will
give
me
all
i
wish
while
she
thus
reasoned
night
came
on
and
soon
the
whole
palace
was
buried
in
sleep
she
entered
her
father
bedchamber
and
cut
off
the
fatal
lock
then
passed
out
of
the
city
and
entered
the
enemy
camp
she
demanded
to
be
led
to
the
king
and
thus
addressed
him
i
am
scylla
the
daughter
of
nisus
i
surrender
to
you
my
country
and
my
father
house
i
ask
no
reward
but
yourself
for
love
of
you
i
have
done
it
see
here
the
purple
lock
with
this
i
give
you
my
father
and
his
kingdom
she
held
out
her
hand
with
the
fatal
spoil
minos
shrunk
back
and
refused
to
touch
it
the
gods
destroy
thee
infamous
woman
he
exclaimed
disgrace
of
our
time
may
neither
earth
nor
sea
yield
thee
a
surely
my
crete
where
jove
himself
was
cradled
shall
not
be
polluted
with
such
a
monster
thus
he
said
and
gave
orders
that
equitable
terms
should
be
allowed
to
the
conquered
city
and
that
the
fleet
should
immediately
sail
from
the
island
scylla
was
frantic
ungrateful
man
she
exclaimed
is
it
thus
you
leave
me
me
who
have
given
you
victory
who
have
sacrificed
for
you
parent
and
country
i
am
guilty
i
confess
and
deserve
to
die
but
not
by
your
hand
as
the
ships
left
the
shore
she
leaped
into
the
water
and
seizing
the
rudder
of
the
one
which
carried
minos
she
was
borne
along
an
unwelcome
companion
of
their
course
a
ing
aloft
it
was
her
father
who
had
been
changed
into
that
form
seeing
her
pounced
down
upon
her
and
struck
her
with
his
beak
and
claws
in
terror
she
let
go
the
ship
and
would
have
fallen
into
the
water
but
some
pitying
deity
changed
her
into
a
bird
the
still
cherishes
the
old
animosity
and
whenever
he
espies
her
in
his
lofty
flight
you
may
see
him
dart
down
upon
her
with
beak
and
claws
to
take
vengeance
for
the
ancient
crime
echo
and
narcissus
echo
was
a
beautiful
nymph
fond
of
the
woods
and
hills
where
she
devoted
herself
to
woodland
sports
she
was
a
favorite
of
diana
and
attended
her
in
the
chase
but
echo
had
one
failing
she
was
fond
of
talking
and
whether
in
chat
or
argument
would
have
the
last
word
one
day
juno
was
seeking
her
husband
who
she
had
reason
to
fear
was
amusing
himself
among
the
nymphs
echo
by
her
talk
contrived
to
detain
the
goddess
till
the
nymphs
made
their
escape
when
juno
discovered
it
she
passed
sentence
upon
echo
in
these
words
you
shall
forfeit
the
use
of
that
tongue
with
which
you
have
cheated
me
except
for
that
one
purpose
you
are
so
fond
of
reply
you
shall
still
have
the
last
word
but
no
power
to
speak
first
this
nymph
saw
narcissus
a
beautiful
youth
as
he
pursued
the
chase
upon
the
mountains
she
loved
him
and
followed
his
footsteps
o
how
she
longed
to
address
him
in
the
softest
accents
and
win
him
to
converse
but
it
was
not
in
her
power
she
waited
with
impatience
for
him
to
speak
first
and
had
her
answer
ready
one
day
the
youth
being
separated
from
his
companions
shouted
aloud
who
here
echo
replied
here
narcissus
looked
around
but
seeing
no
one
called
out
come
echo
answered
come
as
no
one
came
narcissus
called
again
why
do
you
shun
me
echo
asked
the
same
question
let
us
join
one
another
said
the
youth
the
maid
answered
with
all
her
heart
in
the
same
words
and
hastened
to
the
spot
ready
to
throw
her
arms
about
his
neck
he
started
back
exclaiming
hands
off
i
would
rather
die
than
you
should
have
me
have
me
said
she
but
it
was
all
in
vain
he
left
her
and
she
went
to
hide
her
blushes
in
the
recesses
of
the
woods
from
that
time
forth
she
lived
in
caves
and
among
mountain
cliffs
her
form
faded
with
grief
till
at
last
all
her
flesh
shrank
away
her
bones
were
changed
into
rocks
and
there
was
nothing
left
of
her
but
her
voice
with
that
she
is
still
ready
to
reply
to
any
one
who
calls
her
and
keeps
up
her
old
habit
of
having
the
last
word
narcissus
cruelty
in
this
case
was
not
the
only
instance
he
shunned
all
the
rest
of
the
nymphs
as
he
had
done
poor
echo
one
day
a
maiden
who
had
in
vain
endeavored
to
attract
him
uttered
a
prayer
that
he
might
some
time
or
other
feel
what
it
was
to
love
and
meet
no
return
of
affection
the
avenging
goddess
heard
and
granted
the
prayer
there
was
a
clear
fountain
with
water
like
silver
to
which
the
shepherds
never
drove
their
flocks
nor
the
mountain
goats
resorted
nor
any
of
the
beasts
of
the
forest
neither
was
it
defaced
with
fallen
leaves
or
branches
but
the
grass
grew
fresh
around
it
and
the
rocks
sheltered
it
from
the
sun
hither
came
one
day
the
youth
fatigued
with
hunting
heated
and
thirsty
he
stooped
down
to
drink
and
saw
his
own
image
in
the
water
he
thought
it
was
some
beautiful
living
in
the
fountain
he
stood
gazing
with
admiration
at
those
bright
eyes
those
locks
curled
like
the
locks
of
bacchus
or
apollo
the
rounded
cheeks
the
ivory
neck
the
parted
lips
and
the
glow
of
health
and
exercise
over
all
he
fell
in
love
with
himself
he
brought
his
lips
near
to
take
a
kiss
he
plunged
his
arms
in
to
embrace
the
beloved
object
it
fled
at
the
touch
but
returned
again
after
a
moment
and
renewed
the
fascination
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
he
lost
all
thought
of
food
or
rest
while
he
hovered
over
the
brink
of
the
fountain
gazing
upon
his
own
image
he
talked
with
the
supposed
spirit
why
beautiful
being
do
you
shun
me
surely
my
face
is
not
one
to
repel
you
the
nymphs
love
me
and
you
yourself
look
not
indifferent
upon
me
when
i
stretch
forth
my
arms
you
do
the
same
and
you
smile
upon
me
and
answer
my
beckonings
with
the
like
his
tears
fell
into
the
water
and
disturbed
the
image
as
he
saw
it
depart
he
exclaimed
stay
i
entreat
you
let
me
at
least
gaze
upon
you
if
i
may
not
touch
you
with
this
and
much
more
of
the
same
kind
he
cherished
the
flame
that
consumed
him
so
that
by
degrees
he
lost
his
color
his
vigor
and
the
beauty
which
formerly
had
so
charmed
the
nymph
echo
she
kept
near
him
however
and
when
he
exclaimed
alas
alas
she
answered
him
with
the
same
words
he
pined
away
and
died
and
when
his
shade
passed
the
stygian
river
it
leaned
over
the
boat
to
catch
a
look
of
itself
in
the
waters
the
nymphs
mourned
for
him
especially
the
and
when
they
smote
their
breasts
echo
smote
hers
also
they
prepared
a
funeral
pile
and
would
have
burned
the
body
but
it
was
nowhere
to
be
found
but
in
its
place
a
flower
purple
within
and
surrounded
with
white
leaves
which
bears
the
name
and
preserves
the
memory
of
narcissus
milton
alludes
to
the
story

milton
has
imitated
the
story
of
narcissus
in
the
account
which
he
makes
eve
give
of
the
first
sight
of
herself
reflected
in
the

that
day
i
oft
remember
when
from
sleep
i
first
awaked
and
found
myself
reposed
under
a
shade
on
flowers
much
wondering
where
and
what
i
was
whence
thither
brought
and
how
not
distant
far
from
thence
a
murmuring
sound
of
waters
issued
from
a
cave
and
spread
into
a
liquid
plain
then
stood
unmoved
pure
as
the
expanse
of
heaven
i
thither
went
with
unexperienced
thought
and
laid
me
down
on
the
green
bank
to
look
into
the
clear
smooth
lake
that
to
me
seemed
another
sky
as
i
bent
down

just

iv
no
one
of
the
fables
of
antiquity
has
been
oftener
alluded
to
by
the
poets
than
that
of
narcissus
here
are
two
epigrams
which
treat
it
in
different
ways
the
first
is
by
goldsmith
on
a
beautiful
youth
struck
blind
by
lightning
sure
was
by
providence
designed
rather
in
pity
than
in
hate
that
he
should
be
like
cupid
blind
to
save
him
from
narcissus
fate
the
other
is
by
cowper
on
an
ugly
fellow
beware
my
friend
of
crystal
brook
or
fountain
lest
that
hideous
hook
thy
nose
thou
chance
to
see
narcissus
fate
would
then
be
thine
and
thou
pine
as
he
clytie
clytie
was
a
and
in
love
with
apollo
who
made
her
no
return
so
she
pined
away
sitting
all
day
long
upon
the
cold
ground
with
her
unbound
tresses
streaming
over
her
shoulders
nine
days
she
sat
and
tasted
neither
food
nor
drink
her
own
tears
and
the
chilly
dew
her
only
food
she
gazed
on
the
sun
when
he
rose
and
as
he
passed
through
his
daily
course
to
his
setting
she
saw
no
other
object
her
face
turned
constantly
on
him
at
last
they
say
her
limbs
rooted
in
the
ground
her
face
became
a
flower
footnote
the
sunflower
which
turns
on
its
stem
so
as
always
to
face
the
sun
throughout
its
daily
course
for
it
retains
to
that
extent
the
feeling
of
the
nymph
from
whom
it
sprang
hood
in
his
flowers
thus
alludes
to
clytie
i
will
not
have
the
mad
clytie
whose
head
is
turned
by
the
sun
the
tulip
is
a
courtly
quean
whom
therefore
i
will
shun
the
cowslip
is
a

the
violet
is
a
nun
but
i
will
woo
the
dainty
rose
the
queen
of

the
sunflower
is
a
favorite
emblem
of
constancy
thus
moore
uses
it
the
heart
that
has
truly
loved
never
forgets
but
as
truly
loves
on
to
the
close
as
the
sunflower
turns
on
her
god
when
he
sets
the

that

turned

rose

leander
was
a
youth
of
abydos
a
town
of
the
asian
side
of
the
strait
which
separates

and
europe
on
the
opposite

in
the

of

lived
the
maiden
hero
a
priestess
of

leander
loved
her
and
used
to
swim
the
strait
nightly
to
enjoy
the
company
of
his
mistress
guided
by
a
torch
which
she
reared
upon
the
tower
for
the
purpose
but
one
night
a
tempest
arose
and
the
sea
was
rough
his
strength
failed
and
he
was
drowned
the
waves
bore
his
body
to
the
european
shore
where
hero
became
aware
of
his
death
and
in
her
despair
cast
herself
down
from
the
tower
into
the
sea
and
perished

sonnet

toiling

swooning

doth
purse
his
weary

horrid
dream

how
his

the
story
of
leander
swimming
the
hellespont
was
looked
upon
as
fabulous
and
the
feat
considered
impossible
till
lord
byron
proved
its
possibility
by
performing
it
himself
in
the
bride
of
abydos
he
says
these
limbs

wave

borne

almost
a
mile
and
there
is
a
constant
current
setting
out
from
the
sea
of
marmora
into
the
archipelago
since
byron
time
the
feat
has
been
achieved
by
others
but
it
yet
remains
a
test
of
strength
and
skill
in
the
art
of
swimming
sufficient
to
give
a
wide
and
lasting
celebrity
to
any
one
of
our
readers
who
may
dare
to
make
the
attempt
and
succeed
in
accomplishing
it
in
the
beginning
of
the
second
canto
of
the
same
poem
byron
thus
alludes
to
this
story
the
winds
are
high
on

wave
as
on
that
night
of
stormiest
water
when
love
who

forgot
to

the
brave
the
lonely
hope
of

when
alone

rising

breaking
foam
and
shrieking
warned
him
home

he

minerva
minerva
the
goddess
of
wisdom
was
the
daughter
of
jupiter
she
was
said
to
have
leaped
forth
from
his
brain
mature
and
in
complete
armor
she
presided
over
the
useful
and
ornamental
arts
both
those
of
men
such
as
agriculture
and
navigation
and
those
of
women
spinning
weaving
and
needlework
she
was
also
a
warlike
divinity
but
it
was
defensive
war
only
that
she
patronized
and
she
had
no
sympathy
with
mars
savage
love
of
violence
and
bloodshed
athens
was
her
chosen
seat
her
own
city
awarded
to
her
as
the
prize
of
a
contest
with
neptune
who
also
aspired
to
it
the
tale
ran
that
in
the
reign
of
cecrops
the
first
king
of
athens
the
two
deities
contended
for
the
possession
of
the
city
the
gods
decreed
that
it
should
be
awarded
to
that
one
who
produced
the
gift
most
useful
to
mortals
neptune
gave
the
horse
minerva
produced
the
olive
the
gods
gave
judgment
that
the
olive
was
the
more
useful
of
the
two
and
awarded
the
city
to
the
goddess
and
it
was
named
after
her
athens
her
name
in
greek
being
athene
there
was
another
contest
in
which
a
mortal
dared
to
come
in
competition
with
minerva
that
mortal
was
arachne
a
maiden
who
had
attained
such
skill
in
the
arts
of
weaving
and
embroidery
that
the
nymphs
themselves
would
leave
their
groves
and
fountains
to
come
and
gaze
upon
her
work
it
was
not
only
beautiful
when
it
was
done
but
beautiful
also
in
the
doing
to
watch
her
as
she
took
the
wool
in
its
rude
state
and
formed
it
into
rolls
or
separated
it
with
her
fingers
and
carded
it
till
it
looked
as
light
and
soft
as
a
cloud
or
twirled
the
spindle
with
skilful
touch
or
wove
the
web
or
after
it
was
woven
adorned
it
with
her
needle
one
would
have
said
that
minerva
herself
had
taught
her
but
this
she
denied
and
could
not
bear
to
be
thought
a
pupil
even
of
a
goddess
let
minerva
try
her
skill
with
mine
said
she
if
beaten
i
will
pay
the
penalty
minerva
heard
this
and
was
displeased
she
assumed
the
form
of
an
old
woman
and
went
and
gave
arachne
some
friendly
advice
i
have
had
much
experience
said
she
and
i
hope
you
will
not
despise
my
counsel
challenge
your
as
you
will
but
do
not
compete
with
a
goddess
on
the
contrary
i
advise
you
to
ask
her
forgiveness
for
what
you
have
said
and
as
she
is
merciful
perhaps
she
will
pardon
you
arachne
stopped
her
spinning
and
looked
at
the
old
dame
with
anger
in
her
countenance
keep
your
counsel
said
she
for
your
daughters
or
handmaids
for
my
part
i
know
what
i
say
and
i
stand
to
it
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
goddess
let
her
try
her
skill
if
she
dare
venture
she
comes
said
minerva
and
dropping
her
disguise
stood
confessed
the
nymphs
bent
low
in
homage
and
all
the
bystanders
paid
reverence
arachne
alone
was
unterrified
she
blushed
indeed
a
sudden
color
dyed
her
cheek
and
then
she
grew
pale
but
she
stood
to
her
resolve
and
with
a
foolish
conceit
of
her
own
skill
rushed
on
her
fate
minerva
forbore
no
longer
nor
interposed
any
further
advice
they
proceed
to
the
contest
each
takes
her
station
and
attaches
the
web
to
the
beam
then
the
slender
shuttle
is
passed
in
and
out
among
the
threads
the
reed
with
its
fine
teeth
strikes
up
the
woof
into
its
place
and
compacts
the
web
both
work
with
speed
their
skilful
hands
move
rapidly
and
the
excitement
of
the
contest
makes
the
labor
light
wool
of
tyrian
dye
is
contrasted
with
that
of
other
colors
shaded
off
into
one
another
so
adroitly

the
joining
deceives
the
eye

to

terror
at
the
sight

to
draw
back

canvas
with
similar
subjects
wonderfully
well
done
but
strongly
marking
her
presumption
and
impiety
minerva
could
not
forbear
to
admire
yet
felt
indignant
at
the
insult
she
struck
the
web
with
her
shuttle
and
rent
it
in
pieces
she
then
touched
the
forehead
of

her
guilt

shame
she
could
not
endure
it

went
and
hanged

pitied
her
as

made
a

when

saw
as
overlaid

mastered
with
workmanship
so
rare
she
stood
astonied
long
ne
aught
gainsaid

with
eyes
on

by

be
proud
of
but
it
was
not
her
husband
fame
nor
her
own
beauty
nor
their
great
descent
nor
the
power
of
their
kingdom
that
elated
her
it
was
her
children
and
truly
the
happiest
of
mothers
would
niobe
have
been
if
only
she
had
not
claimed
to
be
so
it
was
on
occasion
of
the
annual
celebration
in
honor
of
latona
and
her
offspring
apollo
and
diana
when
the
people
of
thebes
were
assembled
their
brows
crowned
with
laurel
bearing
frankincense
to
the
altars
and
paying
their
vows
that
niobe
appeared
among
the
crowd
her
attire
was
splendid
with
gold
and
gems
and
her
aspect
beautiful
as
the
face
of
an
angry
woman
can
be
she
stood
and
surveyed
the
people
with
haughty
looks
what
folly
said
she
is
this
to
prefer
beings
whom
you
never
saw
to
those
who
stand
before
your
eyes
why
should
latona
be
honored
with
worship
and
none
be
paid
to
me
my
father
was
tantalus
who
was
received
as
a
guest
at
the
table
of
the
gods
my
mother
was
a
goddess
my
husband
built
and
rules
this
city
thebes
and
phrygia
is
my
paternal
inheritance
wherever
i
turn
my
eyes
i
survey
the
elements
of
my
power
nor
is
my
form
and
presence
unworthy
of
a
goddess
to
all
this
let
me
add
i
have
seven
sons
and
seven
daughters
and
look
for
and
of
pretensions
worthy
of
my
alliance
have
i
not
cause
for
pride
will
you
prefer
to
me
this
latona
the
daughter
with
her
two
children
i
have
seven
times
as
many
fortunate
indeed
am
i
and
fortunate
i
shall
remain
will
any
one
deny
this
my
abundance
is
my
security
i
feel
myself
too
strong
for
fortune
to
subdue
she
may
take
from
me
much
i
shall
still
have
much
left
were
i
to
lose
some
of
my
children
i
should
hardly
be
left
as
poor
as
latona
with
her
two
only
away
with
you
from
these
solemnities
put
off
the
laurel
from
your
brows
have
done
with
this
worship
the
people
obeyed
and
left
the
sacred
services
uncompleted
the
goddess
was
indignant
on
the
cynthian
mountain
top
where
she
dwelt
she
thus
addressed
her
son
and
daughter
my
children
i
who
have
been
so
proud
of
you
both
and
have
been
used
to
hold
myself
second
to
none
of
the
goddesses
except
juno
alone
begin
now
to
doubt
whether
i
am
indeed
a
goddess
i
shall
be
deprived
of
my
worship
altogether
unless
you
protect
me
she
was
proceeding
in
this
strain
but
apollo
interrupted
her
say
no
more
said
he
speech
only
delays
punishment
so
said
diana
also
darting
through
the
air
veiled
in
clouds
they
alighted
on
the
towers
of
the
city
spread
out
before
the
gates
was
a
broad
plain
where
the
youth
of
the
city
pursued
their
warlike
sports
the
sons
of
niobe
were
there
with
the
rest
some
mounted
on
spirited
horses
richly
caparisoned
some
driving
gay
chariots
ismenos
the
as
he
guided
his
foaming
steeds
struck
with
an
arrow
from
above
cried
out
ah
me
dropped
the
reins
and
fell
lifeless
another
hearing
the
sound
of
the
bow
like
a
boatman
who
sees
the
storm
gathering
and
makes
all
sail
for
the
port
gave
the
reins
to
his
horses
and
attempted
to
escape
the
inevitable
arrow
overtook
him
as
he
fled
two
others
younger
boys
just
from
their
tasks
had
gone
to
the
playground
to
have
a
game
of
wrestling
as
they
stood
breast
to
breast
one
arrow
pierced
them
both
they
uttered
a
cry
together
together
cast
a
parting
look
around
them
and
together
breathed
their
last
alphenor
an
elder
brother
seeing
them
fall
hastened
to
the
spot
to
render
assistance
and
fell
stricken
in
the
act
of
brotherly
duty
one
only
was
left
ilioneus
he
raised
his
arms
to
heaven
to
try
whether
prayer
might
not
avail
spare
me
ye
gods
he
cried
addressing
all
in
his
ignorance
that
all
needed
not
his
intercessions
and
apollo
would
have
spared
him
but
the
arrow
had
already
left
the
string
and
it
was
too
late
the
terror
of
the
people
and
grief
of
the
attendants
soon
made
niobe
acquainted
with
what
had
taken
place
she
could
hardly
think
it
possible
she
was
indignant
that
the
gods
had
dared
and
amazed
that
they
had
been
able
to
do
it
her
husband
amphion
overwhelmed
with
the
blow
destroyed
himself
alas
how
different
was
this
niobe
from
her
who
had
so
lately
driven
away
the
people
from
the
sacred
rites
and
held
her
stately
course
through
the
city
the
envy
of
her
friends
now
the
pity
even
of
her
foes
she
knelt
over
the
lifeless
bodies
and
kissed
now
one
now
another
of
her
dead
sons
raising
her
pallid
arms
to
heaven
cruel
latona
said
she
feed
full
your
rage
with
my
anguish
satiate
your
hard
heart
while
i
follow
to
the
grave
my
seven
sons
yet
where
is
your
triumph
bereaved
as
i
am
i
am
still
richer
than
you
my
conqueror
scarce
had
she
spoken
when
the
bow
sounded
and
struck
terror
into
all
hearts
except
niobe
alone
she
was
brave
from
excess
of
grief
the
sisters
stood
in
garments
of
mourning
over
the
biers
of
their
dead
brothers
one
fell
struck
by
an
arrow
and
died
on
the
corpse
she
was
bewailing
another
attempting
to
console
her
mother
suddenly
ceased
to
speak
and
sank
lifeless
to
the
earth
a
third
tried
to
escape
by
flight
a
fourth
by
concealment
another
stood
trembling
uncertain
what
course
to
take
six
were
now
dead
and
only
one
remained
whom
the
mother
held
clasped
in
her
arms
and
covered
as
it
were
with
her
whole
body
spare
me
one
and
that
the
youngest
o
spare
me
one
of
so
many
she
cried
and
while
she
spoke
that
one
fell
dead
desolate
she
sat
among
sons
daughters
husband
all
dead
and
seemed
torpid
with
grief
the
breeze
moved
not
her
hair
no
color
was
on
her
cheek
her
eyes
glared
fixed
and
immovable
there
was
no
sign
of
life
about
her
her
very
tongue
cleaved
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
and
her
veins
ceased
to
convey
the
tide
of
life
her
neck
bent
not
her
arms
made
no
gesture
her
foot
no
step
she
was
changed
to
stone
within
and
without
yet
tears
continued
to
flow
and
borne
on
a
whirlwind
to
her
native
mountain
she
still
remains
a
mass
of
rock
from
which
a
trickling
stream
flows
the
tribute
of
her
grief
the
story
of
niobe
has
furnished
byron
with
a
fine
illustration
of
the
fallen
condition
of
modern
rome
the
niobe
of
nations
there
she
stands
childless
and
crownless
in
her
voiceless
woe
an
empty
urn
within
her
withered
hands
whose
holy
dust
was
scattered
long
ago
the
scipios
tomb
contains
no
ashes
now
the
very
sepulchres
lie
tenantless
of
their
heroic
dwellers
dost
thou
flow
old
tiber
through
a
marble
wilderness
rise
with
thy
yellow
waves
and
mantle
her
distress

iv
this
affecting
story
has
been
made
the
subject
of
a
celebrated
statue
in
the
imperial
gallery
of
florence
it
is
the
principal
figure
of
a
group
supposed
to
have
been
originally
arranged
in
the
pediment
of
a
temple
the
figure
of
the
mother
clasped
by
the
arm
of
her
terrified
child
is
one
of
the
most
admired
of
the
ancient
statues
it
ranks
with
the
laocoon
and
the
apollo
among
the
masterpieces
of
art
the
following
is
a
translation
of
a
greek
epigram
supposed
to
relate
to
this
statue
to
stone
the
gods
have
changed
her
but
in
vain
the
sculptor
art
has
made
her
breathe
again
tragic
as
is
the
story
of
niobe
we
can
not
forbear
to
smile
at
the
use
moore
has
made
of
it
in
rhymes
on
the
road
was
in
his
carriage
the
sublime
sir
richard
blackmore
used
to
rhyme
and
if
the
wits
do
do
him
wrong
death
and
epics
passed
his
time
scribbling
and
killing
all
day
long
like
phoebus
in
his
car
at
ease
now
warbling
forth
a
lofty
song
now
murdering
the
young
niobes
sir
richard
blackmore
was
a
physician
and
at
the
same
time
a
very
prolific
and
very
tasteless
poet
whose
works
are
now
forgotten
unless
when
recalled
to
mind

some
wit
like

for
the
sake

chapter
xv
the
graeae
or
perseus
medusa
atlas
andromeda
the
graeae
and
the
gorgons
the
graeae
were
three
sisters
who
were
from
their
birth
whence
their
name
the
gorgons
were
monstrous
females
with
huge
teeth
like
those
of
swine
brazen
claws
and
snaky
hair
none
of
these
beings
make
much
figure
in
mythology
except
medusa
the
gorgon
whose
story
we
shall
next
advert
to
we
mention
them
chiefly
to
introduce
an
ingenious
theory
of
some
modern
writers
namely
that
the
gorgons
and
graeae
were
only
personifications
of
the
terrors
of
the
sea
the
former
denoting
the
strong
billows
of
the
wide
open
main
and
the
latter
the
waves
that
dash
against
the
rocks
of
the
coast
their
names
in
greek
signify
the
above
epithets
perseus
and
medusa
perseus
was
the
son
of
jupiter
and
danae
his
grandfather
acrisius
alarmed
by
an
oracle
which
had
told
him
that
his
daughter
child
would
be
the
instrument
of
his
death
caused
the
mother
and
child
to
be
shut
up
in
a
chest
and
set
adrift
on
the
sea
the
chest
floated
towards
seriphus
where
it
was
found
by
a
fisherman
who
conveyed
the
mother
and
infant
to
polydectes
the
king
of
the
country
by
whom
they
were
treated
with
kindness
when
perseus
was
grown
up
polydectes
sent
him
to
attempt
the
conquest
of
medusa
a
terrible
monster
who
had
laid
waste
the
country
she
was
once
a
beautiful
maiden
whose
hair
was
her
chief
glory
but
as
she
dared
to
vie
in
beauty
with
minerva
the
goddess
deprived
her
of
her
charms
and
changed
her
beautiful
ringlets
into
hissing
serpents
she
became
a
cruel
monster
of
so
frightful
an
aspect
that
no
living
thing
could
behold
her
without
being
turned
into
stone
all
around
the
cavern
where
she
dwelt
might
be
seen
the
stony
figures
of
men
and
animals
which
had
chanced
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
and
had
been
petrified
with
the
sight
perseus
favored
by
minerva
and
mercury
the
former
of
whom
lent
him
her
shield
and
the
latter
his
winged
shoes
approached
medusa
while
she
slept
and
taking
care
not
to
look
directly
at
her
but
guided
by
her
image
reflected
in
the
bright
shield
which
he
bore
he
cut
off
her
head
and
gave
it
to
minerva
who
fixed
it
in
the
middle
of
her
aegis
milton
in
his
comus
thus
alludes
to
the
aegis
what
was
that
that
wise
minerva
wore
unconquered
virgin
wherewith
she
freezed
her
foes
to
congealed
stone
but
rigid
looks
of
chaste
austerity
and
noble
grace
that
dashed
brute
violence
with
sudden
adoration
and
blank
awe
armstrong
the
poet
of
the
art
of
preserving
health
thus
describes
the
effect
of
frost
upon
the
waters
now
blows
the
surly
north
and
chills
throughout
the
stiffening
regions
while
by
stronger
charms
than
circe
or
fell
medea
brewed
each
brook
that
wont
to
prattle
to
its
banks
lies
all
bestilled
and
wedged
betwixt
its
banks
nor
moves
the
withered
reeds
the
surges
baited
by
the
fierce
tossing
with
fretful
spleen
their
angry
heads
in
the
foam
of
all
their
madness
struck
to
monumental
ice
such
execution
so
stern
so
sudden
wrought
the
grisly
aspect
of
terrible
medusa
when
wandering
through
the
woods
she
turned
to
stone
their
savage
tenants
just
as
the
foaming
lion
sprang
furious
on
his
prey
her
speedier
power
outran
his
haste
and
fixed
in
that
fierce
attitude
he
stands
like
rage
in
marble
imitations
of
shakspeare
perseus
and
atlas
after
the
slaughter
of
medusa
perseus
bearing
with
him
the
head
of
the
gorgon
flew
far
and
wide
over
land
and
sea
as
night
came
on
he
reached
the
western
limit
of
the
earth
where
the
sun
goes
down
here
he
would
gladly
have
rested
till
morning
it
was
the
realm
of
king
atlas
whose
bulk
surpassed
that
of
all
other
men
he
was
rich
in
flocks
and
herds
and
had
no
neighbor
or
rival
to
dispute
his
state
but
his
chief
pride
was
in
his
gardens
whose
fruit
was
of
gold
hanging
from
golden
branches
half
hid
with
golden
leaves
perseus
said
to
him
i
come
as
a
guest
if
you
honor
illustrious
descent
i
claim
jupiter
for
my
father
if
mighty
deeds
i
plead
the
conquest
of
the
gorgon
i
seek
rest
and
food
but
atlas
remembered
that
an
ancient
prophecy
had
warned
him
that
a
son
of
jove
should
one
day
rob
him
of
his
golden
apples
so
he
answered
begone
or
neither
your
false
claims
of
glory
nor
parentage
shall
protect
you
and
he
attempted
to
thrust
him
out
perseus
finding
the
giant
too
strong
for
him
said
since
you
value
my
friendship
so
little
deign
to
accept
a
present
and
turning
his
face
away
he
held
up
the
gorgon
head
atlas
with
all
his
bulk
was
changed
into
stone
his
beard
and
hair
became
forests
his
arms
and
shoulders
cliffs
his
head
a
summit
and
his
bones
rocks
each
part
increased
in
bulk
till
he
became
a
mountain
and
such
was
the
pleasure
of
the
gods
heaven
with
all
its
stars
rests
upon
his
shoulders
the
perseus
continuing
his
flight
arrived
at
the
country
of
the
aethiopians
of
which
cepheus
was
king
cassiopeia
his
queen
proud
of
her
beauty
had
dared
to
compare
herself
to
the
nymphs
which
roused
their
indignation
to
such
a
degree
that
they
sent
a
prodigious
to
ravage
the
coast
to
appease
the
deities
cepheus
was
directed
by
the
oracle
to
expose
his
daughter
andromeda
to
be
devoured
by
the
monster
as
perseus
looked
down
from
his
aerial
height
he
beheld
the
virgin
chained
to
a
rock
and
waiting
the
approach
of
the
serpent
she
was
so
pale
and
motionless
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
flowing
tears
and
her
hair
that
moved
in
the
breeze
he
would
have
taken
her
for
a
marble
statue
he
was
so
startled
at
the
sight
that
he
almost
forgot
to
wave
his
wings
as
he
hovered
over
her
he
said
o
virgin
undeserving
of
those
chains
but
rather
of
such
as
bind
fond
lovers
together
tell
me
i
beseech
you
your
name
and
the
name
of
your
country
and
why
you
are
thus
bound
at
first
she
was
silent
from
modesty
and
if
she
could
would
have
hid
her
face
with
her
hands
but
when
he
repeated
his
questions
for
fear
she
might
be
thought
guilty
of
some
fault
which
she
dared
not
tell
she
disclosed
her
name
and
that
of
her
country
and
her
mother
pride
of
beauty
before
she
had
done
speaking
a
sound
was
heard
off
upon
the
water
and
the
appeared
with
his
head
raised
above
the
surface
cleaving
the
waves
with
his
broad
breast
the
virgin
shrieked
the
father
and
mother
who
had
now
arrived
at
the
scene
wretched
both
but
the
mother
more
justly
so
stood
by
not
able
to
afford
protection
but
only
to
pour
forth
lamentations
and
to
embrace
the
victim
then
spoke
perseus
there
will
be
time
enough
for
tears
this
hour
is
all
we
have
for
rescue
my
rank
as
the
son
of
jove
and
my
renown
as
the
slayer
of
the
gorgon
might
make
me
acceptable
as
a
suitor
but
i
will
try
to
win
her
by
services
rendered
if
the
gods
will
only
be
propitious
if
she
be
rescued
by
my
valor
i
demand
that
she
be
my
reward
the
parents
consent
how
could
they
hesitate
and
promise
a
royal
dowry
with
her
and
now
the
monster
was
within
the
range
of
a
stone
thrown
by
a
skilful
slinger
when
with
a
sudden
bound
the
youth
soared
into
the
air
as
an
eagle
when
from
his
lofty
flight
he
sees
a
serpent
basking

upon
him
and
seizes
him
by
the
neck
to
prevent
him
from
turning
his
head
round
and
using
his
fangs
so
the
youth
darted
down
upon
the
back
of
the
monster
and
plunged
his
sword
into
its
shoulder
irritated
by
the
wound
the
monster
raised
himself
in
the
air
then
plunged
into
the
depth
then
like
a
wild
boar
surrounded
by
a
pack
of
barking
dogs
turned
swiftly
from
side
to
side
while
the
youth
eluded
its
attacks
by
means
of
his
wings
wherever
he
can
find
a
passage
for
his
sword
between
the
scales
he
makes
a
wound
piercing
now
the
side
now
the
flank
as
it
slopes
towards
the
tail
the
brute
spouts
from
his
nostrils
water
mixed
with
blood
the
wings
of
the
hero
are
wet
with
it
and
he
dares
no
longer
trust
to
them
alighting
on
a
rock
which
rose
above
the
waves
and
holding
on
by
a
projecting
fragment
as
the
monster
floated
near
he
gave
him
a
death
stroke
the
people
who
had
gathered
on
the
shore
shouted
so
that
the
hills
reechoed
the
sound
the
parents
transported
with
joy
embraced
their
future
calling
him
their
deliverer
and
the
savior
of
their
house
and
the
virgin
both
cause
and
reward
of
the
contest
descended
from
the
rock
cassiopeia
was
an
aethiopian
and
consequently
in
spite
of
her
boasted
beauty
black
at
least
so
milton
seems
to
have
thought
who
alludes
to
this
story
in
his
penseroso
where
he
addresses
melancholy
as
the
goddess
sage
and
holy
whose
saintly
visage
is
too
bright
to
hit
the
sense
of
human
sight
and
therefore
to
our
weaker
view
with
black
staid
wisdom
hue
black
but
such
as

might
beseem
or
that
starred
aethiop
queen
that
strove
to
set
her
beauty
praise
above
the
and
their
powers
offended
cassiopeia
is
called
the
starred
aethiop
queen
because
after
her
death
she
was
placed
among
the
stars
forming
the
constellation
of
that
name
though
she
attained
this
honor
yet
the
her
old
enemies
prevailed
so
far
as
to
cause
her
to
be
placed
in
that
part
of
the
heaven
near
the
pole
where
every
night
she
is
half
the
time
held
with
her
head
downward
to
give
her
a
lesson
of
humility
memnon
was
an
aethiopian
prince
of
whom
we
shall
tell
in
a
future
chapter
the
wedding
feast
the
joyful
parents
with
perseus
and
andromeda
repaired
to
the
palace
where
a
banquet
was
spread
for
them
and
all
was
joy
and
festivity
but
suddenly
a
noise
was
heard
of
warlike
clamor
and
phineus
the
betrothed
of
the
virgin
with
a
party
of
his
adherents
burst
in
demanding
the
maiden
as
his
own
it
was
in
vain
that
cepheus
remonstrated
you
should
have
claimed
her
when
she
lay
bound
to
the
rock
the
monster
victim
the
sentence
of
the
gods
dooming
her
to
such
a
fate
dissolved
all
engagements
as
death
itself
would
have
done
phineus
made
no
reply
but
hurled
his
javelin
at
perseus
but
it
missed
its
mark
and
fell
harmless
perseus
would
have
thrown
his
in
turn
but
the
cowardly
assailant
ran
and
took
shelter
behind
the
altar
but
his
act
was
a
signal
for
an
onset
by
his
band
upon
the
guests
of
cepheus
they
defended
themselves
and
a
general
conflict
ensued
the
old
king
retreating
from
the
scene
after
fruitless
expostulations
calling
the
gods
to
witness
that
he
was
guiltless
of
this
outrage
on
the
rights
of
hospitality
perseus
and
his
friends
maintained
for
some
time
the
unequal
contest
but
the
numbers
of
the
assailants
were
too
great
for
them
and
destruction
seemed
inevitable
when
a
sudden
thought
struck
perseus
i
will
make
my
enemy
defend
me
then
with
a
loud
voice
he
exclaimed
if
i
have
any
friend
here
let
him
turn
away
his
eyes
and
held
aloft
the
gorgon
head
seek
not
to
frighten
us
with
your
jugglery
said
thescelus
and
raised
his
javelin
in
act
to
throw
and
became
stone
in
the
very
attitude
ampyx
was
about
to
plunge
his
sword
into
the
body
of
a
prostrate
foe
but
his
arm
stiffened
and
he
could
neither
thrust
forward
nor
withdraw
it
another
in
the
midst
of
a
vociferous
challenge
stopped
his
mouth
open
but
no
sound
issuing
one
of
friends
aconteus
caught
sight
of
the
gorgon
and
stiffened
like
the
rest
astyages
struck
him
with
his
sword
but
instead
of
wounding
it
recoiled
with
a
ringing
noise
phineus
beheld
this
dreadful
result
of
his
unjust
aggression
and
felt
confounded
he
called
aloud
to
his
friends
but
got
no
answer
he
touched
them
and
found
them
stone
falling
on
his
knees
and
stretching
out
his
hands
to
perseus
but
turning
his
head
away
he
begged
for
mercy
take
all
said
he
give
me
but
my
life
base
coward
said
perseus
thus
much
i
will
grant
you
no
weapon
shall
touch
you
moreover
you
shall
be
preserved
in
my
house
as
a
memorial
of
these
events
so
saying
he
held
the
gorgon
head
to
the
side
where
phineus
was
looking
and
in
the
very
form
in
which
he
knelt
with
his
hands
outstretched
and
face
averted
he
became
fixed
immovably
a
mass
of
stone
the
following
allusion
to
perseus
is
from
milman
samor
the
fabled
libyan
bridal
stood
perseus
in
stern
tranquillity
of
wrath
half
stood
half
floated
on
his
while
the
bright
face
on
his
shield
looked
into
stone
the
raging
fray
so
rose
but
with
no
magic
arms
wearing
alone
th
appalling
and
control
of
his
firm
look
the

monsters
giants
sphinx
pegasus
and
chimaera
centaurs
griffin
and
pygmies
monsters
in
the
language
of
mythology
were
beings
of
unnatural
proportions
or
parts
usually
regarded
with
terror
as
possessing
immense
strength
and
ferocity
which
they
employed
for
the
injury
and
annoyance
of
men
some
of
them
were
supposed
to
combine
the
members
of
different
animals
such
were
the
sphinx
and
chimaera
and
to
these
all
the
terrible
qualities
of
wild
beasts
were
attributed
together
with
human
sagacity
and
faculties
others
as
the
giants
differed
from
men
chiefly
in
their
size
and
in
this
particular
we
must
recognize
a
wide
distinction
among
them
the
human
giants
if
so
they
may
be
called
such
as
the
cyclopes
antaeus
orion
and
others
must
be
supposed
not
to
be
altogether
disproportioned
to
human
beings
for
they
mingled
in
love
and
strife
with
them
but
the
superhuman
giants
who
warred
with
the
gods
were
of
vastly
larger
dimensions
tityus
we
are
told
when
stretched
on
the
plain
covered
nine
acres
and
enceladus
required
the
whole
of
mount
aetna
to
be
laid
upon
him
to
keep
him
down
we
have
already
spoken
of
the
war
which
the
giants
waged
against
the
gods
and
of
its
result
while
this
war
lasted
the
giants
proved
a
formidable
enemy
some
of
them
like
briareus
had
a
hundred
arms
others
like
typhon
breathed
out
fire
at
one
time
they
put
the
gods
to
such
fear
that
they
fled
into
egypt
and
hid
themselves
under
various
forms
jupiter
took
the
form
of
a
ram
whence
he
was
afterwards
worshipped
in
egypt
as
the
god
ammon
with
curved
horns
apollo
became
a
crow
bacchus
a
goat
diana
a
cat
juno
a
cow
venus
a
fish
mercury
a
bird
at
another
time
the
giants
attempted
to
climb
up
into
heaven
and
for
that
purpose
took
up
the
mountain
ossa
and
piled
it
on

they
were
at

subdued
by

invented
and

and
his
cyclopes
to
make
for
jupiter
the
sphinx
laius
king
of
thebes
was
warned
by
an
oracle
that
there
was
danger
to
his
throne
and
life
if
his
son
should
be
suffered
to
grow
up
he
therefore
committed
the
child
to
the
care
of
a
herdsman
with
orders
to
destroy
him
but
the
herdsman
moved
with
pity
yet
not
daring
entirely
to
disobey
tied
up
the
child
by
the
feet
and
left
him
hanging
to
the
branch
of
a
tree
in
this
condition
the
infant
was
found
by
a
peasant
who
carried
him
to
his
master
and
mistress
by
whom
he
was
adopted
and
called
oedipus
or
many
years
afterwards
laius
being
on
his
way
to
delphi
accompanied
only
by
one
attendant
met
in
a
narrow
road
a
young
man
also
driving
in
a
chariot
on
his
refusal
to
leave
the
way
at
their
command
the
attendant
killed
one
of
his
horses
and
the
stranger
filled
with
rage
slew
both
laius
and
his
attendant
the
young
man
was
oedipus
who
thus
unknowingly
became
the
slayer
of
his
own
father
shortly
after
this
event
the
city
of
thebes
was
afflicted
with
a
monster
which
infested
the
highroad
it
was
called
the
sphinx
it
had
the
body
of
a
lion
and
the
upper
part
of
a
woman
it
lay
crouched
on
the
top
of
a
rock
and
arrested
all
travellers
who
came
that
way
proposing
to
them
a
riddle
with
the
condition
that
those
who
could
solve
it
should
pass
safe
but
those
who
failed
should
be
killed
not
one
had
yet
succeeded
in
solving
it
and
all
had
been
slain
oedipus
was
not
daunted
by
these
alarming
accounts
but
boldly
advanced
to
the
trial
the
sphinx
asked
him
what
animal
is
that
which
in
the
morning
gees
on
four
feet
at
noon
on
two
and
in
the
evening
upon
three
oedipus
replied
man
who
in
childhood
creeps
on
hands
and
knees
in
manhood
walks
erect
and
in
old
age
with
the
aid
of
a
staff
the
sphinx
was
so
mortified
at
the
solving
of
her
riddle
that
she
cast
herself
down
from
the
rock
and
perished
the
gratitude
of
the
people
for
their
deliverance
was
so
great
that
they
made
oedipus
their
king
giving
him
in
marriage
their
queen
jocasta
oedipus
ignorant
of
his
parentage
had
already
become
the
slayer
of
his
father
in
marrying
the
queen
he
became
the
husband
of
his
mother
these
horrors
remained
undiscovered
till
at
length
thebes
was
afflicted
with
famine
and
pestilence
and
the
oracle
being
consulted
the
double
crime
of
oedipus
came
to
light
jocasta
put
an
end
to
her
own
life
and
oedipus
seized
with
madness
tore
out
his
eyes
and
wandered
away
from
thebes
dreaded
and
abandoned
by
all
except
his
daughters
who
faithfully
adhered
to
him
till
after
a
tedious
period
of
miserable
wandering
he
found
the
termination
of
his
wretched
life
pegasus
and
the
chimaera
when
perseus
cut
off

the
blood
sinking
into

caught
him
and
tamed
him
and
presented
him
to

the
fountain
hippocrene
on
the

mountain
helicon
was
opened
by
a
kick
from
his
hoof
the
chimaera
was
a
fearful
monster
breathing
fire
the
fore
part
of
its
body
was
a
compound
of
the
lion
and
the
goat
and
the
hind
part
a
dragon
it
made
great
havoc
in
lycia
so
that
the
king
iobates
sought
for
some
hero
to
destroy
it
at
that
time
there
arrived
at
his
court
a
gallant
young
warrior
whose
name
was
bellerophon
he
brought
letters
from
proetus
the
of
iobates
recommending
bellerophon
in
the
warmest
terms
as
an
unconquerable
hero
but
added
at
the
close
a
request
to
his
to
put
him
to
death
the
reason
was
that
proetus
was
jealous
of
him
suspecting
that
his
wife
antea
looked
with
too
much
admiration
on
the
young
warrior
from
this
instance
of
bellerophon
being
unconsciously
the
bearer
of
his
own
death

letters
arose
to
describe
any
species
of
communication
which
a
person
is
made
the
bearer
of
containing
matter
prejudicial
to
himself
iobates
on
perusing
the
letters
was
puzzled
what
to
do
not
willing
to
violate
the
claims
of
hospitality
yet
wishing
to
oblige
his
a
lucky
thought
occurred
to
him
to
send
bellerophon
to
combat
with
the
chimaera
bellerophon
accepted
the
proposal
but
before
proceeding
to
the
combat
consulted
the
soothsayer
polyidus
who
advised
him
to
procure
if
possible
the
horse
pegasus
for
the
conflict
for
this
purpose
he
directed
him
to
pass
the
night
in
the
temple
of
minerva
he
did
so
and
as
he
slept
minerva
came
to
him
and
gave
him
a
golden
bridle
when
he
awoke
the
bridle
remained
in
his
hand
minerva
also
showed
him
pegasus
drinking
at
the
well
of
pirene
and
at
sight
of
the
bridle
the
winged
steed
came
willingly
and
suffered
himself
to
be
taken
bellerophon
mounted
him
rose
with
him
into
the
air
soon
found
the
chimaera
and
gained
an
easy
victory
over
the
monster
after
the
conquest
of
the
chimaera
bellerophon
was
exposed
to
further
trials
and
labors
by
his
unfriendly
host
but
by
the
aid
of
pegasus
he
triumphed
in
them
all
till
at
length
iobates
seeing
that
the
hero
was
a
special
favorite
of
the
gods
gave
him
his
daughter
in
marriage
and
made
him
his
successor
on
the
throne
at
last
bellerophon
by
his
pride
and
presumption
drew
upon
himself
the
anger
of
the
gods
it
is
said
he
even
attempted
to
fly
up
into
heaven
on
his
winged
steed
but
jupiter
sent
a
gadfly
which
stung
pegasus
and
made
him
throw
his
rider
who
became
lame
and
blind
in
consequence
after
this
bellerophon
wandered
lonely
through
the
aleian
field
avoiding
the
paths
of

the
golden

medea
the
golden
fleece
in
very
ancient
times
there
lived
in
thessaly
a
king
and
queen
named
athamas
and
nephele
they
had
two
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
after
a
time
athamas
grew
indifferent
to
his
wife
put
her
away
and
took
another
nephele
suspected
danger
to
her
children
from
the
influence
of
the
and
took
measures
to
send
them
out
of
her
reach
mercury
assisted
her
and
gave
her
a
ram
with
a
golden
fleece
on
which
she
set
the
two
children
trusting
that
the
ram
would
convey
them
to
a
place
of
safety
the
ram
vaulted
into
the
air
with
the
children
on
his
back
taking
his
course
to
the
east
till
when
crossing
the
strait
that
divides
europe
and
asia
the
girl
whose
name
was
helle
fell
from
his
back
into
the
sea
which
from
her
was
called
the
hellespont
now
the
dardanelles
the
ram
continued
his
career
till
he
reached
the
kingdom
of
colchis
on
the
eastern
shore
of
the
black
sea
where
he
safely
landed
the
boy
phryxus
who
was
hospitably
received
by
aeetes
king
of
the
country
phryxus
sacrificed
the
ram
to
jupiter
and
gave
the
golden
fleece
to
aeetes
who
placed
it
in
a
consecrated
grove
under
the
care
of
a
sleepless
dragon
there
was
another
kingdom
in
thessaly
near
to
that
of
athamas
and
ruled
over
by
a
relative
of
his
the
king
aeson
being
tired
of
the
cares
of
government
surrendered
his
crown
to
his
brother
pelias
on
condition
that
he
should
hold
it
only
during
the
minority
of
jason
the
son
of
aeson
when
jason
was
grown
up
and
came
to
demand
the
crown
from
his
uncle
pelias
pretended
to
be
willing
to
yield
it
but
at
the
same
time
suggested
to
the
young
man
the
glorious
adventure
of
going
in
quest
of
the
golden
fleece
which
it
was
well
known
was
in
the
kingdom
of
colchis
and
was
as
pelias
pretended
the
rightful
property
of
their
family
jason
was
pleased
with
the
thought
and
forthwith
made
preparations
for
the
expedition
at
that
time
the
only
species
of
navigation
known
to
the
greeks
consisted
of
small
boats
or
canoes
hollowed
out
from
trunks
of
trees
so
that
when
jason
employed
argus
to
build
him
a
vessel
capable
of
containing
fifty
men
it
was
considered
a
gigantic
undertaking
it
was
accomplished
however
and
the
vessel
named
argo
from
the
name
of
the
builder
jason
sent
his
invitation
to
all
the
adventurous
young
men
of
greece
and
soon
found
himself
at
the
head
of
a
band
of
bold
youths
many
of
whom
afterwards
were
renowned
among
the
heroes
and
demigods
of
greece
hercules
theseus
orpheus
and
nestor
were
among
them
they
are
called
the
argonauts
from
the
name
of
their
vessel
the
argo
with
her
crew
of
heroes
left
the
shores
of
thessaly
and
having
touched
at
the
island
of
lemnos
thence
crossed
to
mysia
and
thence
to
thrace
here
they
found
the
sage
phineus
and
from
him
received
instruction
as
to
their
future
course
it
seems
the
entrance
of
the
euxine
sea
was
impeded
by
two
small
rocky
islands
which
floated
on
the
surface
and
in
their
tossings
and
heavings
occasionally
came
together
crushing
and
grinding
to
atoms
any
object
that
might
be
caught
between
them
they
were
called
the
symplegades
or
clashing
islands
phineus
instructed
the
argonauts
how
to
pass
this
dangerous
strait
when
they
reached
the
islands
they
let
go
a
dove
which
took
her
way
between
the
rocks
and
passed
in
safety
only
losing
some
feathers
of
her
tail
jason
and
his
men
seized
the
favorable
moment
of
the
rebound
plied
their
oars
with
vigor
and
passed
safe
through
though
the
islands
closed
behind
them
and
actually
grazed
their
stern
they
now
rowed
along
the
shore
till
they
arrived
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
sea
and
landed
at
the
kingdom
of
colchis
jason
made
known
his
message
to
the
colchian
king
aeetes
who
consented
to
give
up
the
golden
fleece
if
jason
would
yoke
to
the
plough
two
bulls
with
brazen
feet
and
sow
the
teeth
of
the
dragon
which
cadmus
had
slain
and
from
which
it
was
well
known
that
a
crop
of
armed
men
would
spring
up
who
would
turn
their
weapons
against
their
producer
jason
accepted
the
conditions
and
a
time
was
set
for
making
the
experiment
previously
however
he
found
means
to
plead
his
cause
to
medea
daughter
of
the
king
he
promised
her
marriage
and
as
they
stood
before
the
altar
of
hecate
called
the
goddess
to
witness
his
oath
medea
yielded
and
by
her
aid
for
she
was
a
potent
sorceress
he
was
furnished
with
a
charm
by
which
he
could
encounter
safely
the
breath
of
the
bulls
and
the
weapons
of
the
armed
men
at
the
time
appointed
the
people
assembled
at
the
grove
of
mars
and
the
king
assumed
his
royal
seat
while
the
multitude
covered
the
the
bulls
rushed
in
breathing
fire
from
their
nostrils
that
burned
up
the
herbage
as
they
passed
the
sound
was
like
the
roar
of
a
furnace
and
the
smoke
like
that
of
water
upon
jason
advanced
boldly
to
meet
them
his
friends
the
chosen
heroes
of
greece
trembled
to
behold
him
regardless
of
the
burning
breath
he
soothed
their
rage
with
his
voice
patted
their
necks
with
fearless
hand
and
adroitly
slipped
over
them
the
yoke
and
compelled
them
to
drag
the
plough
the
colchians
were
amazed
the
greeks
shouted
for
joy
jason
next
proceeded
to
sow
the
dragon
teeth
and
plough
them
in
and
soon
the
crop
of
armed
men
sprang
up
and
wonderful
to
relate
no
sooner
had
they
reached
the
surface
than
they
began
to
brandish
their
weapons
and
rush
upon
jason
the
greeks
trembled
for
their
hero
and
even
she
who
had
provided
him
a
way
of
safety
and
taught
him
how
to
use
it
medea
herself
grew
pale
with
fear
jason
for
a
time
kept
his
assailants
at
bay
with
his
sword
and
shield
till
finding
their
numbers
overwhelming
he
resorted
to
the
charm
which
medea
had
taught
him
seized
a
stone
and
threw
it
in
the
midst
of
his
foes
they
immediately
turned
their
arms
against
one
another
and
soon
there
was
not
one
of
the
dragon
brood
left
alive
the
greeks
embraced
their
hero
and
medea
if
she
dared
would
have
embraced
him
too
it
remained
to
lull
to
sleep
the
dragon
that
guarded
the
fleece
and
this
was
done
by
scattering
over
him
a
few
drops
of
a
preparation
which
medea
had
supplied
at
the
smell
he
relaxed
his
rage
stood
for
a
moment
motionless
then
shut
those
great
round
eyes
that
had
never
been
known
to
shut
before
and
turned
over
on
his
side
fast
asleep
jason
seized
the
fleece
and
with
his
friends
and
medea
accompanying
hastened
to
their
vessel
before
aeetes
the
king
could
arrest
their
departure
and
made
the
best
of
their
way
back
to
thessaly
where
they
arrived
safe
and
jason
delivered
the
fleece
to
pelias
and
dedicated
the
argo
to
neptune
what
became
of
the
fleece
afterwards
we
do
not
know
but
perhaps
it
was
found
after
all
like
many
other
golden
prizes
not
worth
the
trouble
it
had
cost
to
procure
it
this
is
one
of
those
mythological
tales
says
a
late
writer
in
which
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
a
substratum
of
truth
exists
though
overlaid
by
a
mass
of
fiction
it
probably
was
the
first
important
maritime
expedition
and
like
the
first
attempts
of
the
kind
of
all
nations
as
we
know
from
history
was
probably
of
a
character
if
rich
spoils
were
the
result
it
was
enough
to
give
rise
to
the
idea
of
the
golden
fleece
another
suggestion
of
a
learned
mythologist
bryant
is
that
it
is
a
corrupt
tradition
of
the
story
of
noah
and
the
ark
the
name
argo
seems
to
countenance
this
and
the
incident
of
the
dove
is
another
confirmation
pope
in
his
ode
on
cecilia
day
thus
celebrates
the
launching
of
the
ship
argo
and
the
power
of
the
music
of
orpheus
whom
he
calls
the
thracian
so
when
the
first
bold
vessel
dared
the
seas
high
on
the
stern
the
thracian
raised
his
strain
while
argo
saw
her
kindred
trees
descend
from
pelion
to
the
main
transported
demigods
stood
round
and
men
grew
heroes
at
the
sound
in
dyer
poem
of
the
fleece
there
is
an
account
of
the
ship
argo
and
her
crew
which
gives
a
good
picture
of
this
primitive
maritime
adventure
from
every
region
of
aegea
shore
the
brave
assembled
those
illustrious
twins
castor
and
pollux
orpheus
tuneful

zetes
and
calais
as
the

in

strong
hercules
and
many
a
chief
renowned
on

iolcos
sandy
shore
they
thronged
gleaming
in
armor
ardent
of
exploits
and
soon
the
laurel
cord
and
the
huge
stone
uplifting
to
the
deck
unmoored
the
bark
whose
keel
of
wondrous
length
the
skilful
hand
of
argus
fashioned
for
the
proud
attempt
and
in
the
extended
keel
a
lofty
mast
upraised
and
sails
full
swelling
to
the
chiefs
unwonted
objects
now
first
now
they
learned
their
bolder
steerage
over
ocean

led
by
the
golden
stars
as
chiron
art
had
marked
the
sphere
celestial
etc
hercules
left
the
expedition
at
mysia
for
hylas
a
youth
beloved
by
him
having
gone
for
water
was
laid
hold
of
and
kept
by
the
nymphs
of
the
spring
who
were
fascinated
by
his
beauty
hercules
went
in
quest
of
the
lad
and
while
he
was
absent
the
argo
put
to
sea
and
left
him
moore
in
one
of
his
songs
makes
a
beautiful
allusion
to
this
incident
when
hylas
was
sent
with
his
urn
to
the
fount
through
fields
full
of
light
and
with
heart
full
of
play
light
rambled
the
boy
over
meadow
and
mount
and
neglected
his
task
for
the
flowers
in
the
way
thus
many
like
me
who
in
youth
should
have
tasted
the
fountain
that
runs
by
philosophy
shrme
their
time
with
the
flowers
on
the
margin
have
wasted
and
left
their
light
urns
all
as
empty
as
mine
medea
and
aeson
amid
the
rejoicings
for
the
recovery
of
the
golden
fleece
jason
felt
that
one
thing
was
wanting
the
presence
of
aeson
his
father
who
was
prevented
by
his
age
and
infirmities
from
taking
part
in
them
jason
said
to
medea
my
spouse
would
that
your
arts
whose
power
i
have
seen
so
mighty
for
my
aid
could
do
me
one
further
service
take
some
years
from
my
life
and
add
them
to
my
father
medea
replied
not
at
such
a
cost
shall
it
be
done
but
if
my
art
avails
me
his
life
shall
be
lengthened
without
abridging
yours
the
next
full
moon
she
issued
forth
alone
while
all
creatures
slept
not
a
breath
stirred
the
foliage
and
all
was
still
to
the
stars
she
addressed
her
incantations
and
to
the
moon
to
hecate
footnote
hecate
was
a
mysterious
divinity
sometimes
identified
with
diana
and
sometimes
with
proserpine
as
diana
represents
the
moonlight
splendor
of
night
so
hecate
represents
its
darkness
and
terrors
she
was
the
goddess
of
sorcery
and
witchcraft
and
was
believed
to
wander
by
night
along
the
earth
seen
only
by
the
dogs
whose
barking
told
her
approach
the
goddess
of
the
underworld
and
to
tellus
the
goddess
of
the
earth
by
whose
power
plants
potent
for
enchantment
are
produced
she
invoked
the
gods
of
the
woods
and
caverns
of
mountains
and
valleys
of
lakes
and
rivers
of
winds
and
vapors
while
she
spoke

shone

presently
a
chariot
descended
through
the
air
drawn
by
flying
serpents
she
ascended
it
and
borne
aloft
made
her
way
to
distant
regions
where
potent
plants
grew
which
she
knew
how
to
select
for
her
purpose
nine
nights
she
employed
in
her
search
and
during
that
time
came
not
within
the
doors
of
her
palace
nor
under
any
roof
and
shunned

intercourse
with
mortals
she
next
erected
two
altars
the
one
to
hecate
the
other
to
hebe
the
goddess
of
youth
and
sacrificed
a
black
sheep
pouring
libations
of
milk
and
wine
she
implored
pluto
and
his
stolen
bride
that
they
would
not
hasten
to
take
the
old
man
life
then
she
directed
that
aeson
should
be
led
forth
and
having
thrown
him
into
a
deep
sleep
by
a
charm
had
him
laid
on
a
bed
of
herbs
like
one
dead
jason
and
all
others
were
kept
away
from
the
place
that
no
profane
eyes
might
look
upon
her
mysteries
then
with
streaming
hair
she
thrice
moved
round
the
altars
dipped
flaming
twigs
in
the
blood
and
laid
them
thereon
to
burn
meanwhile
the
caldron
with
its
contents
was
got
ready
in
it
she
put
magic
herbs
with
seeds
and
flowers
of
acrid
juice
stones
from
the
distant
east
and
sand
from
the
shore
of
ocean
hoar
frost
gathered
by
moonlight
a
screech
owl
head
and
wings
and
the
entrails
of
a
wolf
she
added
fragments
of
the
shells
of
tortoises
and
the
liver
of
stags
animals
tenacious
of
life
and
the
head
and
beak
of
a
crow
that
outlives
nine
generations
of
men
these
with
many
other
things
without
a
name
she
boiled
together
for
her
purposed
work
stirring
them
up
with
a
dry
olive
branch
and
behold
the
branch
when
taken
out
instantly
became
green
and
before
long
was
covered
with
leaves
and
a
plentiful
growth
of
young
olives
and
as
the
liquor
boiled
and
bubbled
and
sometimes
ran
over
the
grass
wherever
the
sprinklings
fell
shot
forth
with
a
verdure
like
that
of
spring
seeing
that
all
was
ready
medea
cut
the
throat
of
the
old
man
and
let
out
all
his
blood
and
poured
into
his
mouth
and
into
his
wound
the
juices
of
her
caldron
as
soon
as
he
had
completely
imbibed
them
his
hair
and
beard
laid
by
their
whiteness
and
assumed
the
blackness
of
youth
his
paleness
and
emaciation
were
gone
his
veins
were
full
of
blood
his
limbs
of
vigor
and
robustness
aeson
is
amazed
at
himself
and
remembers
that
such
as
he
now
is
he
was
in
his
youthful
days
forty
years
before
medea
used
her
arts
here
for
a
good
purpose
but
not
so
in
another
instance
where
she
made
them
the
instruments
of
revenge
pelias
our
readers
will
recollect
was
the
usurping
uncle
of
jason
and
had
kept
him
out
of
his
kingdom
yet
he
must
have
had
some
good
qualities
for
his
daughters
loved
him
and
when
they
saw
what
medea
had
done
for
aeson
they
wished
her
to
do
the
same
for
their
father
medea
pretended
to
consent
and
prepared
her
caldron
as
before
at
her
request
an
old
sheep
was
brought
and
plunged
into
the
caldron
very
soon
a
bleating
was
heard
in
the
kettle
and
when
the
cover
was
removed
a
lamb
jumped
forth
and
ran
frisking
away
into
the
meadow
the
daughters
of
pelias
saw
the
experiment
with
delight
and
appointed
a
time
for
their
father
to
undergo
the
same
operation
but
medea
prepared
her
caldron
for
him
in
a
very
different
way
she
put
in
only
water
and
a
few
simple
herbs
in
the
night
she
with
the
sisters
entered
the
bed
chamber
of
the
old
king
while
he
and
his
guards
slept
soundly
under
the
influence
of
a
spell
cast
upon
them
by
medea
the
daughters
stood
by
the
bedside
with
their
weapons
drawn
but
hesitated
to
strike
till
medea
chid
their
irresolution
then
turning
away
their
faces
and
giving
random
blows
they
smote
him
with
their
weapons
he
starting
from
his
sleep
cried
out
my
daughters
what
are
you
doing
will
you
kill
your
father
their
hearts
failed
them
and
their
weapons
fell
from
their
hands
but
medea
struck
him
a
fatal
blow
and
prevented
his
saying
more
then
they
placed
him
in
the
caldron
and
medea
hastened
to
depart
in
her
chariot
before
they
discovered
her
treachery
or
their
vengeance
would
have
been
terrible
she
escaped
however
but
had
little
enjoyment
of
the
fruits
of
her
crime
jason
for
whom
she
had
done
so
much
wishing
to
marry
creusa
princess
of
corinth
put
away
medea
she
enraged
at
his
ingratitude
called
on
the
gods
for
vengeance
sent
a
poisoned
robe
as
a
gift
to
the
bride
and
then
killing
her
own
children
and
setting
fire
to
the
palace
mounted
her
chariot
and
fled
to
athens
where
she
married
king
aegeus
the
father
of
theseus
and
we
shall
meet
her
again
when
we
come
to
the
adventures
of
that
hero
the
incantations
of
medea
will
remind
the
reader
of
those
of
the
witches
in
macbeth
the
following
lines
are
those
which
seem
most
strikingly
to
recall
the
ancient
model
round
about
the
caldron
go
in
the
poisoned
entrails
throw

of
a

and
again
what
you
do
witches
a
deed
without
a
name
there
is
another
story
of
medea
almost
too
revolting
for
record
even
of
a
sorceress
a
class
of
persons
to
whom
both
ancient
and
modern
poets
have
been
accustomed
to
attribute
every
degree
of
atrocity
in
her
flight
from
colchis
she
had
taken
her
young
brother
absyrtus
with
her
finding
the
pursuing
vessels
of
aeetes
gaining
upon
the
argonauts
she
caused
the
lad
to
be
killed
and
his
limbs
to
be
strewn
over
the
sea
aeetes
on
reaching
the
place
found
these
sorrowful
traces
of
his
murdered
son
but
while
he
tarried
to
collect
the
scattered
fragments
and
bestow
upon
them
an
honorable
interment
the
argonauts
escaped
in
the
poems
of
campbell
will
be
found
a
translation
of
one
of
the
choruses
of
the
tragedy
of
medea
where
the
poet
euripides
has
taken
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
pay
a
glowing
tribute
to
athens
his
native
city
it
begins
thus
o
haggard
queen
to
athens
dost
thou
guide
thy
glowing
chariot
steeped
in
kindred
gore
or
seek
to
hide
thy
damned
parricide
where
peace
and
justice
dwell

chapter
xviii
meleager
and
atalanta
one
of
the
heroes
of
the
argonautic
expedition
was
meleager
son
of
oeneus
and
althea
king
and
queen
of
calydon
althea
when
her
son
was
born
beheld
the
three
destinies
who
as
they
spun
their
fatal
thread
foretold
that
the
life
of
the
child
should
last
no
longer
than
a
brand
then
burning
upon
the
hearth
althea
seized
and
quenched
the
brand
and
carefully
preserved
it
for
years
while
meleager
grew
to
boyhood
youth
and
manhood
it
chanced
then
that
oeneus
as
he
offered
sacrifices
to
the
gods
omitted
to
pay
due
honors
to
diana
and
she
indignant
at
the
neglect
sent
a
wild
boar
of
enormous
size
to
lay
waste
the
fields
of
calydon
its
eyes
shone
with
blood
and
fire
its
bristles
stood
like
threatening
spears
its
tusks
were
like
those
of
indian
elephants
the
growing
corn
was
trampled
the
vines
and
olive
trees
laid
waste
the
flocks
and
herds
were
driven
in
wild
confusion
by
the
slaughtering
foe
all
common
aid
seemed
vain
but
meleager
called
on
the
heroes
of
greece
to
join
in
a
bold
hunt
for
the
ravenous
monster
theseus
and
his
friend
pirithous
jason
peleus
afterwards
the
father
of
achilles
telamon
the
father
of
ajax
nestor
then
a
youth
but
who
in
his
age
bore
arms
with
achilles
and
ajax
in
the
trojan
war
these
and
many
more
joined
in
the
enterprise
with
them
came
atalanta
the
daughter
of
iasius
king
of
arcadia
a
buckle
of
polished
gold
confined
her
vest
an
ivory
quiver
hung
on
her
left
shoulder
and
her
left
hand
bore
the
bow
her
face
blent
feminine
beauty
with
the
best
graces
of
martial
youth
meleager
saw
and
loved
but
now
already
they
were
near
the
monster
lair
they
stretched
strong
nets
from
tree
to
tree
they
uncoupled
their
dogs
they
tried
to
find
the
footprints
of
their
quarry
in
the
grass
from
the
wood
was
a
descent
to
marshy
ground
here
the
boar
as
he
lay
among
the
reeds
heard
the
shouts
of
his
pursuers
and
rushed
forth
against
them
one
and
another
is
thrown
down
and
slain
jason
throws
his
spear
with
a
prayer
to
diana
for
success
and
the
favoring
goddess
allows
the
weapon
to
touch
but
not
to
wound
removing
the
steel
point
of
the
spear
in
its
flight
nestor
assailed
seeks
and
finds
safety
in
the
branches
of
a
tree
telamon
rushes
on
but
stumbling
at
a
projecting
root
falls
prone
but
an
arrow
from
atalanta
at
length
for
the
first
time
tastes
the
monster
blood
it
is
a
slight
wound
but
meleager
sees
and
joyfully
proclaims
it
anceus
excited
to
envy
by
the
praise
given
to
a
female
loudly
proclaims
his
own
valor
and
defies
alike
the
boar
and
the
goddess
who
had
sent
it
but
as
he
rushes
on
the
infuriated
beast
lays
him
low
with
a
mortal
wound
theseus
throws
his
lance
but
it
is
turned
aside
by
a
projecting
bough
the
dart
of
jason
misses
its
object
and
kills
instead
one
of
their
own
dogs
but
meleager
after
one
unsuccessful
stroke
drives
his
spear
into
the
monster
side
then
rushes
on
and
despatches
him
with
repeated
blows
then
rose
a
shout
from
those
around
they
congratulated
the
conqueror
crowding
to
touch
his
hand
he
placing
his
foot
upon
the
head
of
the
slain
boar
turned
to
atalanta
and
bestowed
on
her
the
head
and
the
rough
hide
which
were
the
trophies
of
his
success
but
at
this
envy
excited
the
rest
to
strife
plexippus
and
toxeus
the
brothers
of
meleager
mother
beyond
the
rest
opposed
the
gift
and
snatched
from
the
maiden
the
trophy
she
had
received
meleager
kindling
with
rage
at
the
wrong
done
to
himself
and
still
more
at
the
insult
offered
to
her
whom
he
loved
forgot
the
claims
of
kindred
and
plunged
his
sword
into
the
offenders
hearts
as
althea
bore
gifts
of
thankfulness
to
the
temples
for
the
victory
of
her
son
the
bodies
of
her
murdered
brothers
met
her
sight
she
shrieks
and
beats
her
breast
and
hastens
to
change
the
garments
of
rejoicing
for
those
of
mourning
but
when
the
author
of
the
deed
is
known
grief
gives
way
to
the
stern
desire
of
vengeance
on
her
son
the
fatal
brand
which
once
she
rescued
from
the
flames
the
brand
which
the
destinies
had
linked
with
meleager
life
she
brings
forth
and
commands
a
fire
to
be
prepared
then
four
times
she
essays
to
place
the
brand
upon
the
pile
four
times
draws
back
shuddering
at
the
thought
of
bringing
destruction
on
her
son
the
feelings
of
the
mother
and
the
sister
contend
within
her
now
she
is
pale
at
the
thought
of
the
proposed
deed
now
flushed
again
with
anger
at
the
act
of
her
son
as
a
vessel
driven
in
one
direction
by
the
wind
and
in
the
opposite
by
the
tide
the
mind
of
althea
hangs
suspended
in
uncertainty
but
now
the
sister
prevails
above
the
mother
and
she
begins
as
she
holds
the
fatal
wood
turn
ye
furies
goddesses
of
punishment
turn
to
behold
the
sacrifice
i
bring
crime
must
atone
for
crime
shall
oeneus
rejoice
in
his
victor
son
while
the
house
of
thestius
is
desolate
but
alas
to
what
deed
am
i
borne
along
brothers
forgive
a
mother
weakness
my
hand
fails
me
he
deserves
death
but
not
that
i
should
destroy
him
but
shall
he
then
live
and
triumph
and
reign
over
calydon
while
you
my
brothers
wander
unavenged
among
the
shades
no
thou
hast
lived
by
my
gift
die
now
for
thine
own
crime
return
the
life
which
twice
i
gave
thee
first
at
thy
birth
again
when
i
snatched
this
brand
from
the
flames
o
that
thou
hadst
then
died
alas
evil
is
the
conquest
but
brothers
ye
have
conquered
and
turning
away
her
face
she
threw
the
fatal
wood
upon
the
burning
pile
it
gave
or
seemed
to
give
a
deadly
groan
meleager
absent
and
unknowing
of
the
cause
felt
a
sudden
pang
he
burns
and
only
by
courageous
pride
conquers
the
pain
which
destroys
him
he
mourns
only
that
he
perishes
by
a
bloodless
and
unhonored
death
with
his
last
breath
he
calls
upon
his
aged
father
his
brother
and
his
fond
sisters
upon
his
beloved
atalanta
and
upon
his
mother
the
unknown
cause
of
his
fate
the
flames
increase
and
with
them
the
pain
of
the
hero
now
both
subside
now
both
are
quenched
the
brand
is
ashes
and
the
life
of
meleager
is
breathed
forth
to
the
wandering
winds
althea
when
the
deed
was
done
laid
violent
hands
upon
herself
the
sisters
of
meleager
mourned
their
brother
with
uncontrollable
grief
till
diana
pitying
the
sorrows
of
the
house
that
once
had
aroused
her
anger
turned
them
into
birds
atalanta
the
innocent
cause
of
so
much
sorrow
was
a
maiden
whose
face
you
might
truly
say
was
boyish
for
a
girl
yet
too
girlish
for
a
boy
her
fortune
had
been
told
and
it
was
to
this
effect
atalanta
do
not
marry
marriage
will
be
your
ruin
terrified
by
this
oracle
she
fled
the
society
of
men
and
devoted
herself
to
the
sports
of
the
chase
to
all
suitors
for
she
had
many
she
imposed
a
condition
which
was
generally
effectual
in
relieving
her
of
their
persecutions
i
will
be
the
prize
of
him
who
shall
conquer
me
in
the
race
but
death
must
be
the
penalty
of
all
who
try
and
fail
in
spite
of
this
hard
condition
some
would
try
hippomenes
was
to
be
judge
of
the
race
can
it
be
possible
that
any
will
be
so
rash
as
to
risk
so
much
for
a
wife
said
he
but
when
he
saw
her
lay
aside
her
robe
for
the
race
he
changed
his
mind
and
said
pardon
me
youths
i
knew
not
the
prize
you
were
competing
for
as
he
surveyed
them
he
wished
them
all
to
be
beaten
and
swelled
with
envy
of
any
one
that
seemed
at
all
likely
to
win
while
such
were
his
thoughts
the
virgin
darted
forward
as
she
ran
she
looked
more
beautiful
than
ever
the
breezes
seemed
to
give
wings
to
her
feet
her
hair
flew
over
her
shoulders
and
the
gay
fringe
of
her
garment
fluttered
behind
her
a
ruddy
hue
tinged
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
such
as
a
crimson
curtain
casts
on
a
marble
wall
all
her
competitors
were
distanced
and
were
put
to
death
without
mercy
hippomenes
not
daunted
by
this
result
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
virgin
said
why
boast
of
beating
those
laggards
i
offer
myself
for
the
contest
atalanta
looked
at
him
with
a
pitying
countenance
and
hardly
knew
whether
she
would
rather
conquer
him
or
not
what
god
can
tempt
one
so
young
and
handsome
to
throw
himself
away
i
pity
him
not
for
his
beauty
yet
he
is
beautiful
but
for
his
youth
i
wish
he
would
give
up
the
race
or
if
he
will
be
so
mad
i
hope
he
may
outrun
me
while
she
hesitates
revolving
these
thoughts
the
spectators
grow
impatient
for
the
race
and
her
father
prompts
her
to
prepare
then
hippomenes
addressed
a
prayer
to
venus
help
me
venus
for
you
have
led
me
on
venus
heard
and
was
propitious
in
the
garden
of
her
temple
in
her
own
island
of
cyprus
is
a
tree
with
yellow
leaves
and
yellow
branches
and
golden
fruit
hence
she
gathered
three
golden
apples
and
unseen
by
any
one
else
gave
them
to
hippomenes
and
told
him
how
to
use
them
the
signal
is
given
each
starts
from
the
goal
and
skims
over
the
sand
so
light
their
tread
you
would
almost

spectators

hippomenes
now
now

your
best

haste

relax
not
one
more
effort
it
was
doubtful
whether
the
youth
or
the
maiden
heard
these
cries
with
the
greater
pleasure
but
his
breath
began
to
fail
him
his
throat
was
dry
the
goal
yet
far
off
at
that
moment
he
threw
down
one
of
the
golden
apples
the
virgin
was
all
amazement
she
stopped
to
pick
it
up
hippomenes
shot
ahead
shouts
burst
forth
from
all
sides
she
redoubled
her
efforts
and
soon
overtook
him
again
he
threw
an
apple
she
stopped
again
but
again
came
up
with
him
the
goal
was
near
one
chance
only
remained
now
goddess
said
he
prosper
your
gift
and
threw
the
last
apple
off
at
one
side
she
looked
at
it
and
hesitated
venus
impelled
her
to
turn
aside
for
it
she
did
so
and
was
vanquished
the
youth
carried
off
his
prize
but
the
lovers
were
so
full
of
their
own
happiness
that
they
forgot
to
pay
due
honor
to
venus
and
the
goddess
was
provoked
at
their
ingratitude
she
caused
them
to
give
offence
to
cybele
that
powerful
goddess
was
not
to
be
insulted
with
impunity
she
took
from
them
their
human
form
and
turned
them
into
animals
of
characters
resembling
their
own
of
the
triumphing
in
the
blood
of
her
lovers
she
made
a
lioness
and
of
her
lord
and
master
a
lion

yoked
them

her
car

they
are
still
to
be

chapter

hercules
hebe
and
ganymede
hercules
hercules
was
the
son
of
jupiter
and
alcmena
as
juno
was
always
hostile
to
the
offspring
of
her
husband
by
mortal
mothers
she
declared
war
against
hercules
from
his
birth
she
sent
two
serpents
to
destroy
him
as
he
lay
in
his
cradle
but
the
precocious
infant
strangled
them
with
his
own
hands
he
was
however
by
the
arts
of
juno
rendered
subject
to
eurystheus
and
compelled
to
perform
all
his
commands
eurystheus
enjoined
upon
him
a
succession
of
desperate
adventures
which
are
called
the
twelve
labors
of
hercules
the
first
was
the
fight
with
the
nemean
lion
the
valley
of
nemea
was
infested
by
a
terrible
lion
eurystheus
ordered
hercules
to
bring
him
the
skin
of
this
monster
after
using
in
vain
his
club
and
arrows
against
the
lion
hercules
strangled
the
animal
with
his
hands
he
returned
carrying
the
dead
lion
on
his
shoulders
but
eurystheus
was
so
frightened
at
the
sight
of
it
and
at
this
proof
of
the
prodigious
strength
of
the
hero
that
he
ordered
him
to
deliver
the
account
of
his
exploits
in
future
outside
the
town
his
next
labor
was
the
slaughter
of
the
hydra
this
monster
ravaged
the
country
of
argos
and
dwelt
in
a
swamp
near
the
well
of
amymone
this
well
had
been
discovered
by
amymone
when
the
country
was
suffering
from
drought
and
the
story
was
that
neptune
who
loved
her
had
permitted
her
to
touch
the
rock
with
his
trident
and
a
spring
of
three
outlets
burst
forth
here
the
hydra
took
up
his
position
and
hercules
was
sent
to
destroy
him
the
hydra
had
nine
heads
of
which
the
middle
one
was
immortal
hercules
struck
off
its
heads
with
his
club
but
in
the
place
of
the
head
knocked
off
two
new
ones
grew
forth
each
time
at
length
with
the
assistance
of
his
faithful
servant
iolaus
he
burned
away
the
heads
of
the
hydra
and
buried
the
ninth
or
immortal
one
under
a
huge
rock
another
labor
was
the
cleaning
of
the
augean
stables
augeas
king
of
elis
had
a
herd
of
three
thousand
oxen
whose
stalls
had
not
been
cleansed
for
thirty
years
hercules
brought
the
rivers
alpheus
and
peneus
through
them
and
cleansed
them
thoroughly
in
one
day
his
next
labor
was
of
a
more
delicate
kind
admeta
the
daughter
of
eurystheus
longed
to
obtain
the
girdle
of
the
queen
of
the
amazons
and
eurystheus
ordered
hercules
to
go
and
get
it
the
amazons
were
a
nation
of
women
they
were
very
warlike
and
held
several
flourishing
cities
it
was
their
custom
to
bring
up
only
the
female
children
the
boys
were
either
sent
away
to
the
neighboring
nations
or
put
to
death
hercules
was
accompanied
by
a
number
of
volunteers
and
after
various
adventures
at
last
reached
the
country
of
the
amazons
hippolyta
the
queen
received
him
kindly
and
consented
to
yield
him
her
girdle
but
juno
taking
the
form
of
an
amazon
went
and
persuaded
the
rest
that
the
strangers
were
carrying
off
their
queen
they
instantly
armed
and
came
in
great
numbers
down
to
the
ship
hercules
thinking
that
hippolyta
had
acted
treacherously
slew
her
and
taking
her
girdle
made
sail
homewards
another
task
enjoined
him
was
to
bring
to
eurystheus
the
oxen
of
geryon
a
monster
with
three
bodies
who
dwelt
in
the
island
erytheia
the
red
so
called
because
it
lay
at
the
west
under
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
this
description
is
thought
to
apply
to
spain
of
which
geryon
was
king
after
traversing
various
countries
hercules
reached
at
length
the
frontiers
of
libya
and
europe
where
he
raised
the
two
mountains
of
calpe
and
abyla
as
monuments
of
his
progress
or
according
to
another
account
rent
one
mountain
into
two
and
left
half
on
each
side
forming
the
straits
of
gibraltar
the
two
mountains
being
called
the
pillars
of
hercules
the
oxen
were
guarded
by
the
giant
eurytion
and
his
dog
but
hercules
killed
the
giant
and
his
dog
and
brought
away
the
oxen
in
safety
to
eurystheus
the
most
difficult
labor
of
all
was
getting
the
golden
apples
of
the
hesperides
for
hercules
did
not
know
where
to
find
them
these
were
the
apples
which
juno
had
received
at
her
wedding
from
the
goddess
of
the
earth
and
which
she
had
intrusted
to
the
keeping
of
the
daughters
of
hesperus
assisted
by
a
watchful
dragon
after
various
adventures
hercules
arrived
at
mount
atlas
in
africa
atlas
was
one
of
the
titans
who
had
warred
against
the
gods
and
after
they
were
subdued
atlas
was
condemned
to
bear
on
his
shoulders
the
weight
of
the
heavens
he
was
the
father
of
the
hesperides
and
hercules
thought
might
if
any
one
could
find
the
apples
and
bring
them
to
him
but
how
to
send
atlas
away
from
his
post
or
bear
up
the
heavens
while
he
was
gone
hercules
took
the
burden
on
his
own
shoulders
and
sent
atlas
to
seek
the
apples
he
returned
with
them
and
though
somewhat
reluctantly
took
his
burden
upon
his
shoulders
again
and
let
hercules
return
with
the
apples
to
eurystheus
milton
in
his
comus
makes
the
hesperides
the
daughters
of
hesperus
and
nieces
of
atlas
amidst
the
gardens
fair
of
hesperus
and
his
daughters
three
that
sing
about
the
golden
tree
the
poets
led
by
the
analogy
of
the
lovely
appearance
of
the
western
sky
at
sunset
viewed
the
west
as
a
region
of
brightness
and
glory
hence
they
placed
in
it
the
isles
of
the
blest
the
ruddy
isle
erythea
on
which
the
bright
oxen
of
geryon
were
pastured
and
the
isle
of
the
hesperides
the
apples
are
supposed
by
some
to
be
the
oranges
of
spain
of
which
the
greeks
had
heard
some
obscure
accounts
a
celebrated
exploit
of
hercules
was
his
victory
over
antaeus
antaeus
the
son
of
terra
the
earth
was
a
mighty
giant
and
wrestler
whose
strength
was
invincible
so
long
as
he
remained
in
contact
with
his
mother
earth
he
compelled
all
strangers
who
came
to
his
country
to
wrestle
with
him
on
condition
that
if
conquered
as
they
all
were
they
should
be
put
to
death
hercules
encountered
him
and
finding
that
it
was
of
no
avail
to
throw
him
for
he
always
rose
with
renewed
strength
from
every
fall
he
lifted
him
up
from
the
earth
and
strangled
him
in
the
air
cacus
was
a
huge
giant
who
inhabited
a
cave
on
mount
aventine
and
plundered
the
surrounding
country
when
hercules
was
driving
home
the
oxen
of
geryon
cacus
stole
part
of
the
cattle
while
the
hero
slept
that
their
footprints
might
not
serve
to
show
where
they
had
been
driven
he
dragged
them
backward
by
their
tails
to
his
cave
so
their
tracks
all
seemed
to
show
that
they
had
gone
in
the
opposite
direction
hercules
was
deceived
by
this
stratagem
and
would
have
failed
to
find
his
oxen
if
it
had
not
happened
that
in
driving
the
remainder
of
the
herd
past
the
cave
where
the
stolen
ones
were
concealed
those
within
began
to
low
and
were
thus
discovered
cacus
was
slain
by
hercules
the
last
exploit
we
shall
record
was
bringing
cerberus
from
the
lower
world
hercules
descended
into
hades
accompanied
by
mercury
and
minerva
he
obtained
permission
from
pluto
to
carry
cerberus
to
the
upper
air
provided
he
could
do
it
without
the
use
of
weapons
and
in
spite
of
the
monster
struggling
he
seized
him
held
him
fast
and
carried
him
to
eurystheus
and
afterwards
brought
him
back
again
when
he
was
in
hades
he
obtained
the
liberty
of
theseus
his
admirer
and
imitator
who
had
been
detained
a
prisoner
there
for
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
carry
off
proserpine
hercules
in
a
fit
of
madness
killed
his
friend
iphitus
and
was
condemned
for
this
offence
to
become
the
slave
of
queen
omphale
for
three
years
while
in
this
service
the
hero
nature
seemed
changed
he
lived
effeminately
wearing
at
times
the
dress
of
a
woman
and
spinning
wool
with
the
of
omphale
while
the
queen
wore
his
lion
skin
when
this
service
was
ended
he
married
dejanira
and
lived
in
peace
with
her
three
years
on
one
occasion
as
he
was
travelling
with
his
wife
they
came
to
a
river
across
which
the
centaur
nessus
carried
travellers
for
a
stated
fee
hercules
himself
forded
the
river
but
gave
dejanira
to
nessus
to
be
carried
across
nessus
attempted
to
run
away
with
her
but
hercules
heard
her
cries
and
shot
an
arrow
into
the
heart
of
nessus
the
dying
centaur
told
dejanira
to
take
a
portion
of
his
blood
and
keep
it
as
it
might
be
used
as
a
charm
to
preserve
the
love
of
her
husband
dejanira
did
so
and
before
long
fancied
she
had
occasion
to
use
it
hercules
in
one
of
his
conquests
had
taken
prisoner
a
fair
maiden
named
iole
of
whom
he
seemed
more
fond
than
dejanira
approved
when
hercules
was
about
to
offer
sacrifices
to
the
gods
in
honor
of
his
victory
he
sent
to
his
wife
for
a
white
robe
to
use
on
the
occasion
dejanira
thinking
it
a
good
opportunity
to
try
her
steeped
the
garment
in
the
blood
of
nessus
we
are
to
suppose
she
took
care
to
wash
out
all
traces
of
it
but
the
magic
power
remained
and
as
soon
as
the
garment
became
warm
on
the
body
of
hercules
the
poison
penetrated
into
all
his
limbs
and
caused
him
the
most
intense
agony
in
his
frenzy
he
seized
lichas
who
had
brought
him
the
fatal
robe
and
hurled
him
into
the
sea
he
wrenched
off
the
garment
but
it
stuck
to
his
flesh
and
with
it
he
tore
away
whole
pieces
of
his
body
in
this
state
he
embarked
on
board
a
ship
and
was
conveyed
home
dejanira
on
seeing
what
she
had
unwittingly
done
hung
herself
hercules
prepared
to
die
ascended
mount
oeta
where
he
built
a
funeral
pile
of
trees
gave
his
bow
and
arrows
to
philoctetes
and
laid
himself
down
on
the
pile
his
head
resting
on
his
club
and
his
lion
skin
spread
over
him
with
a
countenance
as
serene
as
if
he
were
taking
his
place
at
a
festal
board
he
commanded
philoctetes
to
apply
the
torch
the
flames
spread
apace
and
soon
invested
the
whole
mass
milton
thus
alludes
to
the
frenzy
of
hercules
as
when
alcides
from
oechalia
crowned
with
conquest
felt
the
envenomed
robe
and
tore
through
pain
up
by
the
roots
thessalian
pines
and
lichas
from
the
top
of
oeta
threw
into
the
euboic
sea

brought

jupiter
with

it

now
i

who
conquered
all

i

attaining
this
honor
yet
no

can
deny
that
he
has
deserved
it
the
gods
all
gave
their
assent
juno
only
heard
the
closing
words
with
some
displeasure
that
she
should
be
so
particularly
pointed
at
yet
not
enough
to
make
her
regret
the
determination
of
her
husband
so
when
the
flames
had
consumed
the
mother
share
of
hercules
the
diviner
part
instead
of
being
injured
thereby
seemed
to
start
forth
with
new
vigor
to
assume
a
more
lofty
port
and
a
more
awful
dignity
jupiter
enveloped
him
in

him
up

theseus
daedalus
castor
and
pollux
theseus
theseus
was
the
son
of
aegeus
king
of
athens
and
of
aethra
daughter
of
the
king
of
troezen
he
was
brought
up
at
troezen
and
when
arrived
at
manhood
was
to
proceed
to
athens
and
present
himself
to
his
father
aegeus
on
parting
from
aethra
before
the
birth
of
his
son
placed
his
sword
and
shoes
under
a
large
stone
and
directed
her
to
send
his
son
to
him
when
he
became
strong
enough
to
roll
away
the
stone
and
take
them
from
under
it
when
she
thought
the
time
had
come
his
mother
led
theseus
to
the
stone
and
he
removed
it
with
ease
and
took
the
sword
and
shoes
as
the
roads
were
infested
with
robbers
his
grandfather
pressed
him
earnestly
to
take
the
shorter
and
safer
way
to
his
country
by
sea
but
the
youth
feeling
in
himself
the
spirit
and
the
soul
of
a
hero
and
eager
to
signalize
himself
like
hercules
with
whose
fame
all
greece
then
rang
by
destroying
the
and
monsters
that
oppressed
the
country
determined
on
the
more
perilous
and
adventurous
journey
by
land
his
first
day
journey
brought
him
to
epidaurus
where
dwelt
a
man
named
periphetes
a
son
of
vulcan
this
ferocious
savage
always
went
armed
with
a
club
of
iron
and
all
travellers
stood
in
terror
of
his
violence
when
he
saw
theseus
approach
he
assailed
him
but
speedily
fell
beneath
the
blows
of
the
young
hero
who
took
possession
of
his
club
and
bore
it
ever
afterwards
as
a
memorial
of
his
first
victory
several
similar
contests
with
the
petty
tyrants
and
marauders
of
the
country
followed
in
all
of
which
theseus
was
victorious
one
of
these
was
called
procrustes
or
the
stretcher
he
had
an
iron
bedstead
on
which
he
used
to
tie
all
travellers
who
fell
into
his
hands
if
they
were
shorter
than
the
bed
he
stretched
their
limbs
to
make
them
fit
it
if
they
were
longer
than
the
bed
he
lopped
off
a
portion
theseus
served
him
as
he
had
served
others
having
overcome
all
the
perils
of
the
road
theseus
at
length
reached
athens
where
new
dangers
awaited
him
medea
the
sorceress
who
had
fled
from
corinth
after
her
separation
from
jason
had
become
the
wife
of
aegeus
the
father
of
theseus
knowing
by
her
arts
who
he
was
and
fearing
the
loss
of
her
influence
with
her
husband
if
theseus
should
be
acknowledged
as
his
son
she
filled
the
mind
of
aegeus
with
suspicions
of
the
young
stranger
and
induced
him
to
present
him
a
cup
of
poison
but
at
the
moment
when
theseus
stepped
forward
to
take
it
the
sight
of
the
sword
which
he
wore
discovered
to
his
father
who
he
was
and
prevented
the
fatal
draught
medea
detected
in
her
arts
fled
once
more
from
deserved
punishment
and
arrived
in
asia
where
the
country
afterwards
called
media
received
its
name
from
her
theseus
was
acknowledged
by
his
father
and
declared
his
successor
the
athenians
were
at
that
time
in
deep
affliction
on
account
of
the
tribute
which
they
were
forced
to
pay
to
minos
king
of
crete
this
tribute
consisted
of
seven
youths
and
seven
maidens
who
were
sent
every
year
to
be
devoured
by
the
minotaur
a
monster
with
a
bull
body
and
a
human
head
it
was
exceedingly
strong
and
fierce
and
was
kept
in
a
labyrinth
constructed
by
daedalus
so
artfully
contrived
that
whoever
was
enclosed
in
it
could
by
no
means
find
his
way
out
unassisted
here
the
minotaur
roamed
and
was
fed
with
human
victims
theseus
resolved
to
deliver
his
countrymen
from
this
calamity
or
to
die
in
the
attempt
accordingly
when
the
time
of
sending
off
the
tribute
came
and
the
youths
and
maidens
were
according
to
custom
drawn
by
lot
to
be
sent
he
offered
himself
as
one
of
the
victims
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
his
father
the
ship
departed
under
black
sails
as
usual
which
theseus
promised
his
father
to
change
for
white
in
case
of
his
returning
victorious
when
they
arrived
in
crete
the
youths
and
maidens
were
exhibited
before
minos
and
ariadne
the
daughter
of
the
king
being
present
became
deeply
enamored
of
theseus
by
whom
her
love
was
readily
returned
she
furnished
him
with
a
sword
with
which
to
encounter
the
minotaur
and
with
a
clew
of
thread
by
which
he
might
find
his
way
out
of
the
labyrinth
he
was
successful
slew
the
minotaur
escaped
from
the
labyrinth
and
taking
ariadne
as
the
companion
of
his
way
with
his
rescued
companions
sailed
for
athens
on
their
way
they
stopped
at
the
island
of
naxos
where
theseus
abandoned
ariadne
leaving
her
asleep
footnote
one
of
the
finest
pieces
of
sculpture
in
italy
the
recumbent
ariadne
of
the
vatican
represents
this
incident
a
copy
is
owned
by
the
athenaeum
boston
and
deposited
in
the
museum
of
fine
arts
his
excuse
for
this
ungrateful
treatment
of
his
benefactress
was
that
minerva
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
and
commanded
him
to
do
so
on
approaching
the
coast
of
attica
theseus
forgot
the
signal
appointed
by
his
father
and
neglected
to
raise
the
white
sails
and
the
old
king
thinking
his
son
had
perished
put
an
end
to
his
own
life
theseus
thus
became
king
of
athens
one
of
the
most
celebrated
of
the
adventures
of
theseus
is
his
expedition
against
the
amazons
he
assailed
them
before
they
had
recovered
from
the
attack
of
hercules
and
carried
off
their
queen
antiope
the
amazons
in
their
turn
invaded
the
country
of
athens
and
penetrated
into
the
city
itself
and
the
final
battle
in
which
theseus
overcame
them
was
fought
in
the
very
midst
of
the
city
this
battle
was
one
of
the
favorite
subjects
of
the
ancient
sculptors
and
is
commemorated
in
several
works
of
art
that
are
still
extant
the
friendship
between
theseus
and
pirithous
was
of
a
most
intimate
nature
yet
it
originated
in
the
midst
of
arms
pirithous
had
made
an
irruption
into
the
plain
of
marathon
and
carried
off
the
herds
of
the
king
of
athens
theseus
went
to
repel
the
plunderers
the
moment
pirithous
beheld
him
he
was
seized
with
admiration
he
stretched
out
his
hand
as
a
token
of
peace
and
cried
be
judge
thyself
what
satisfaction
dost
thou
require
thy
friendship
replied
the
athenian
and
they
swore
inviolable
fidelity
their
deeds
corresponded
to
their
professions
and
they
ever
continued
true
brothers
in
arms
each
of
them
aspired
to
espouse
a
daughter
of
jupiter
theseus
fixed
his
choice
on
helen
then
but
a
child
afterwards
so
celebrated
as
the
cause
of
the
trojan
war
and
with
the
aid
of
his
friend
he
carried
her
off
pirithous
aspired
to
the
wife
of
the
monarch
of
erebus
and
theseus
though
aware
of
the
danger
accompanied
the
ambitious
lover
in
his
descent
to
the
but
pluto
seized
and
set
them
on
an
enchanted
rock
at
his
palace
gate
where
they
remained
till
hercules
arrived
and
liberated
theseus
leaving
pirithous
to
his
fate
after
the
death
of
antiope
theseus
married
phaedra
daughter
of
minos
king
of
crete
phaedra
saw
in
hippolytus
the
son
of
theseus
a
youth
endowed
with
all
the
graces
and
virtues
of
his
father
and
of
an
age
corresponding
to
her
own
she
loved
him
but
he
repulsed
her
advances
and
her
love
was
changed
to
hate
she
used
her
influence
over
her
infatuated
husband
to
cause
him
to
be
jealous
of
his
son
and
he
imprecated
the
vengeance
of
neptune
upon
him
as
hippolytus
was
one
day
driving
his
chariot
along
the
shore
a
raised
himself
above
the
waters
and
frightened
the
horses
so
that
they
ran
away
and
dashed
the
chariot
to
pieces
hippolytus
was
killed
but
by
diana
assistance
aesculapius
restored
him
to
life
diana
removed
hippolytus
from
the
power
of
his
deluded
father
and
false
stepmother
and
placed
him
in
italy
under
the
protection
of
the
nymph
egeria
theseus
at
length
lost
the
favor
of
his
people
and
retired
to
the
court
of
lycomedes
king
of
scyros
who
at
first
received
him
kindly
but
afterwards
treacherously
slew
him
in
a
later
age
the
athenian
general
cimon
discovered
the
place
where
his
remains
were
laid
and
caused
them
to
be
removed
to
athens
where
they
were
deposited
in
a
temple
called
the
theseum
erected
in
honor
of
the
hero
the
queen
of
the
amazons
whom
theseus
espoused
is
by
some
called
hippolyta
that
is
the
name
she
bears
in
shakspeare
midsummer
night
dream
the
subject
of
which
is
the
festivities
attending
the
nuptials
of
theseus
and
hippolyta
hemans
has
a
poem
on
the
ancient
greek
tradition
that
the
shade
of
theseus
appeared
strengthening
his
countrymen
at
the
battle
of
marathon
theseus
is
a
personage
it
is
recorded
of
him
that
he
united
the
several
tribes
by
whom
the
territory
of
attica
was
then
possessed
into
one
state
of
which
athens
was
the
capital
in
commemoration
of
this
important
event
he
instituted
the
festival
of
panathenaea
in
honor
of
minerva
the
patron
deity
of
athens
this
festival
differed
from
the
other
grecian
games
chiefly
in
two
particulars
it
was
peculiar
to
the
athenians
and
its
chief
feature
was
a
solemn
procession
in
which
the
peplus
or
sacred
robe
of
minerva
was
carried
to
the
parthenon
and
suspended
before
the
statue
of
the
goddess
the
peplus
was
covered
with
embroidery
worked
by
select
virgins
of
the
noblest
families
in
athens
the
procession
consisted
of
persons
of
all
ages
and
both
sexes
the
old
men
carried
olive
branches
in
their
hands
and
the
young
men
bore
arms
the
young
women
carried
baskets
on
their
heads
containing
the
sacred
utensils
cakes
and
all
things
necessary
for
the
sacrifices
the
procession
formed
the
subject
of
the
which
embellished
the
outside
of
the
temple
of
the
parthenon
a
considerable
portion
of
these
sculptures
is
now
in
the
british
museum
among
those
known
as
the
elgin
marbles
olympic
and
other
games
it
seems
not
inappropriate
to
mention
here
the
other
celebrated
national
games
of
the
greeks
the
first
and
most
distinguished
were
the
olympic
founded
it
was
said
by
jupiter
himself
they
were
celebrated
at
olympia
in
elis
vast
numbers
of
spectators
flocked
to
them
from
every
part
of
greece
and
from
asia
africa
and
sicily
they
were
repeated
every
fifth
year
in
and
continued
five
days
they
gave
rise
to
the
custom
of
reckoning
time
and
dating
events
by
olympiads
the
first
olympiad
is
generally
considered
as
corresponding
with
the
year
the
pythian
games
were
celebrated
in
the
vicinity
of
delphi
the
isthmian
on
the
corinthian
isthmus
the
nemean
at
nemea
a
city
of
argolis
the
exercises
in
these
games
were
of
five
sorts
running
leaping
wrestling
throwing
the
quoit
and
hurling
the
javelin
or
boxing
besides
these
exercises
of
bodily
strength
and
agility
there
were
contests
in
music
poetry
and
eloquence
thus
these
games
furnished
poets
musicians
and
authors
the
best
opportunities
to
present
their
productions
to
the
public
and
the
fame
of
the
victors
was
diffused
far
and
wide
daedalus
the
labyrinth
from
which
theseus
escaped
by
means
of
the
clew
of
ariadne
was
built
by
daedalus
a
most
skilful
artificer
it
was
an
edifice
with
numberless
winding
passages
and
turnings
opening
into
one
another
and
seeming
to
have
neither
beginning
nor
end
like
the
river
maeander
which
returns
on
itself
and
flows
now
onward
now
backward
in
its
course
to
the
sea
daedalus
built
the
labyrinth
for
king
minos
but
afterwards
lost
the
favor
of
the
king
and
was
shut
up
in
a
tower
he
contrived
to
make
his
escape
from
his
prison
but
could
not
leave
the
island
by
sea
as
the
king
kept
strict
watch
on
all
the
vessels
and
permitted
none
to
sail
without
being
carefully
searched
minos
may
control
the
land
and
sea
said
daedalus
but
not
the
regions
of
the
air
i
will
try
that
way
so
he
set
to
work
to
fabricate
wings
for
himself
and
his
young
son
icarus
he
wrought
feathers
together
beginning
with
the
smallest
and
adding
larger
so
as
to
form
an
increasing
surface
the
larger
ones
he
secured
with
thread
and
the
smaller
with
wax
and
gave
the
whole
a
gentle
curvature
like
the
wings
of
a
bird
icarus
the
boy
stood
and
looked
on
sometimes
running
to
gather
up
the
feathers
which
the
wind
had
blown
away
and
then
handling
the
wax
and
working
it
over
with
his
fingers
by
his
play
impeding
his
father
in
his
labors
when
at
last
the
work
was
done
the
artist
waving
his
wings
found
himself
buoyed
upward
and
hung
suspended
poising
himself
on
the
beaten
air
he
next
equipped
his
son
in
the
same
manner
and
taught
him
how
to
fly
as
a
bird
tempts
her
young
ones
from
the
lofty
nest
into
the
air
when
all
was
prepared
for
flight
he
said
icarus
my
son
i
charge
you
to
keep
at
a
moderate
height
for
if
you
fly
too
low
the
damp
will
clog
your
wings
and
if
too
high
the
heat
will
melt
them
keep
near
me
and
you
will
be
safe
while
he
gave
him
these
instructions
and
fitted
the
wings
to
his
shoulders
the
face
of
the
father
was
wet
with
tears
and
his
hands
trembled
he
kissed
the
boy
not
knowing
that
it
was
for
the
last
time
then
rising
on
his
wings
he
flew
off
encouraging
him
to
follow
and
looked
back
from
his
own
flight
to
see
how
his
son
managed
his
wings
as
they
flew
the
ploughman
stopped
his
work
to
gaze
and
the
shepherd
leaned
on
his
staff
and
watched
them
astonished
at
the
sight
and
thinking
they
were
gods
who
could
thus
cleave
the
air
they
passed
samos
and
delos
on
the
left
and
lebynthos
on
the
right
when
the
boy
exulting
in
his
career
began
to
leave
the
guidance
of
his
companion
and
soar
upward
as
if
to
reach
heaven
the
nearness
of
the
blazing
sun
softened
the
wax
which
held
the
feathers
together
and
they
came
off
he
fluttered
with
his
arms
but
no
feathers
remained
to
hold
the
air
while
his
mouth
uttered
cries
to
his
father
it
was
submerged
in
the
blue
waters
of
the
sea
which
thenceforth
was
called
by
his
name
his
father
cried
icarus
icarus
where
are
you
at
last
he
saw
the
feathers
floating
on
the
water
and
bitterly
lamenting
his
own
arts
he
buried
the
body
and
called
the
land
icaria
in
memory
of
his
child
daedalus
arrived
safe
in
sicily
where
he
built
a
temple
to
apollo
and
hung
up
his
wings
an
offering
to
the
god
daedalus
was
so
proud
of
his
achievements
that
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
a
rival
his
sister
had
placed
her
son
perdix
under
his
charge
to
be
taught
the
mechanical
arts
he
was
an
apt
scholar
and
gave
striking
evidences
of
ingenuity
walking
on
the
seashore
he
picked
up
the
spine
of
a
fish
imitating
it
he
took
a
piece
of
iron
and
notched
it
on
the
edge
and
thus
invented
the
saw
he
put
two
pieces
of
iron
together
connecting
them
at
one
end
with
a
rivet
and
sharpening
the
other
ends
and
made
a
pair
of
compasses
daedalus
was
so
envious
of
his
nepnew
performances
that
he
took
an
opportunity
when
they
were
together
one
day
on
the
top
of
a
high
tower
to
push
him
off
but
minerva
who
favors
ingenuity
saw
him
falling
and
arrested
his
fate
by
changing
him
into
a
bird
called
after
his
name
the
partridge
this
bird
does
not
build
his
nest
in
the
trees
nor
take
lofty
flights
but
nestles
in
the
hedges
and
mindful
of
his
fall
avoids
high
places
the
death
of
icarus
is
told
in
the
following
lines
by
darwin
with
melting
wax
and
loosened
strings
sunk
hapless
icarus
on
unfaithful
wings
headlong
he
rushed
through
the
affrighted
air
with
limbs
distorted
and
dishevelled
hair
his
scattered
plumage
danced
upon
the
wave
and
sorrowing
nereids
decked
his
watery
grave
his
pale
corse
their
pearly
shed
and
strewed
with
crimson
moss
his
marble
bed
struck
in
their
coral
towers
the
passing

and

in

castor
and
pollux
castor
and
pollux
were
the
offspring
of
leda
and
the
swan
under
which
disguise
jupiter
had
concealed
himself
leda
gave
birth
to
an
egg
from
which
sprang
the
twins
helen
so
famous
afterwards
as
the
cause
of
the
trojan
war
was
their
sister
when
theseus
and
his
friend
pirithous
had
carried
off
helen
from
sparta
the
youthful
heroes
castor
and
pollux
with
their
followers
hastened
to
her
rescue
theseus
was
absent
from
attica
and
the
brothers
were
successful
in
recovering
their
sister
castor
was
famous
for
taming
and
managing
horses
and
pollux
for
skill
in
boxing
they
were
united
by
the
warmest
affection
and
inseparable
in
all
their
enterprises
they
accompanied
the
argonautic
expedition
during
the
voyage
a
storm
arose
and
orpheus
prayed
to
the
samothracian
gods
and
played
on
his
harp
whereupon
the
storm
ceased
and
stars
appeared
on
the
heads
of
the
brothers
from
this
incident
castor
and
pollux
came
afterwards
to
be
considered
the
patron
deities
of
seamen
and
voyagers
and
the
lambent
flames
which
in
certain
states
of
the
atmosphere
play
round
the
sails
and
masts
of
vessels
were
called
by
their
names
after
the
argonautic
expedition
we
find
castor
and
pollux
engaged
in
a
war
with
idas
and
lynceus
castor
was
slain
and
pollux
inconsolable
for
the
loss
of
his
brother
besought
jupiter
to
be
permitted
to
give
his
own
life
as
a
ransom
for
him
jupiter
so
far
consented
as
to
allow
the
two
brothers
to
enjoy
the
boon
of
life
alternately
passing
one
day
under
the
earth
and
the
next
in
the
heavenly
abodes
according
to
another
form
of
the
story
jupiter
rewarded
the
attachment
of
the
brothers
by
placing
them
among
the
stars
as
gemini
the
twins
they
received
divine
honors
under
the
name
of
dioscuri
sons
of
jove
they
were
believed
to
have
appeared
occasionally
in
later
times
taking
part
with
one
side
or
the
other
in
fields
and
were
said
on
such
occasions
to
be
mounted
on
magnificent
white
steeds
thus
in
the
early
history
of
rome
they
are
said
to
have
assisted
the
romans
at
the
battle
of
lake
regillus
and
after
the
victory
a
temple
was
erected
in
their
honor
on
the
spot
where
they
appeared
macaulay
in
his
lays
of
ancient
rome
thus
alludes
to
the
legend
so
like
they
were
no
mortal
might
one
from
other
know
white
as
snow
their
armor
was
their
steeds
were
white
as
snow
never
on
earthly
anvil
did
such
rare
armor
gleam
and
never
did
such
gallant
steeds
drink
of
an
earthly
stream
back
comes
the
chief
in
triumph
who
in
the
hour
of
fight
hath
seen
the
great
twin
brethren
in
harness
on
his
right
safe
comes
the
ship
to
haven
through
billows
and
through
gales

chapter

bacchus
ariadne
bacchus
bacchus
was
the
son
of
jupiter
and
semele
juno
to
gratify
her
resentment
against
semele
contrived
a
plan
for
her
destruction
assuming
the
form
of
beroe
her
aged
nurse
she
insinuated
doubts
whether
it
was
indeed
jove
himself
who
came
as
a
lover
heaving
a
sigh
she
said
i
hope
it
will
turn
out
so
but
i
ca
help
being
afraid
people
are
not
always
what
they
pretend
to
be
if
he
is
indeed
jove
make
him
give
some
proof
of
it
ask
him
to
come
arrayed
in
all
his
splendors
such
as
he
wears
in
heaven
that
will
put
the
matter
beyond
a
doubt
semele
was
persuaded
to
try
the
experiment
she
asks
a
favor
without
naming
what
it
is
jove
gives
his
promise
and
confirms
it
with
the
irrevocable
oath
attesting
the
river
styx
terrible
to
the
gods
themselves
then
she
made
known
her
request
the
god
would
have
stopped
her
as
she
spake
but
she
was
too
quick
for
him
the
words
escaped
and
he
could
neither
unsay
his
promise
nor
her
request
in
deep
distress
he
left
her
and
returned
to
the
upper
regions
there
he
clothed
himself
in
his
splendors
not
putting
on
all
his
terrors
as
when
he
overthrew
the
giants
but
what
is
known
among
the
gods
as
his
lesser
panoply
arrayed
in
this
he
entered
the
chamber
of
semele
her
mortal
frame
could
not
endure
the
splendors
of
the
immortal
radiance
she
was
consumed
to
ashes
jove
took
the
infant
bacchus
and
gave
him
in
charge
to
the
nysaean
nymphs
who
nourished
his
infancy
and
childhood
and
for
their
care
were
rewarded
by
jupiter
by
being
placed
as
the
hyades
among
the
stars
when
bacchus
grew
up
he
discovered
the
culture
of
the
vine
and
the
mode
of
extracting
its
precious
juice
but
juno
struck
him
with
madness
and
drove
him
forth
a
wanderer
through
various
parts
of
the
earth
in
phrygia
the
goddess
rhea
cured
him
and
taught
him
her
religious
rites
and
he
set
out
on
a
progress
through
asia
teaching
the
people
the
cultivation
of
the
vine
the
most
famous
part
of
his
wanderings
is
his
expedition
to
india
which
is
said
to
have
lasted
several
years
returning
in
triumph
he
undertook
to
introduce
his
worship
into
greece
but
was
opposed
by
some
princes
who
dreaded
its
introduction
on
account
of
the
disorders
and
madness
it
brought
with
it
as
he
approached
his
native
city
thebes
pentheus
the
king
who
had
no
respect
for
the
new
worship
forbade
its
rites
to
be
performed
but
when
it
was
known
that
bacchus
was
advancing
men
and
women
but
chiefly
the
latter
young
and
old
poured
forth
to
meet
him
and
to
join
his
triumphal
march
longfellow
in
his
drinking
song
thus
describes
the
march
of
bacchus
fauns
with
youthful
bacchus
follow
ivy
crowns
that
brow
supernal
as
the
forehead
of
apollo
and
possessing
youth
eternal
round
about
him
fair
bacchantes
bearing
cymbals
flutes
and
thyrses
wild
from
naxian
groves
of
vineyards
sing
delirious
verses
it
was
in
vain
pentheus
remonstrated
commanded
and
threatened
go
said
he
to
his
attendants
seize
this
vagabond
leader
of
the
rout
and
bring
him
to
me
i
will
soon
make
him
confess
his
false
claim
of
heavenly
parentage
and
renounce
his
counterfeit
worship
it
was
in
vain
his
nearest
friends
and
wisest
counsellors
remonstrated
and
begged
him
not
to
oppose
the
god
their
remonstrances
only
made
him
more
violent
but
now
the
attendants
returned
whom
he
had
despatched
to
seize
bacchus
they
had
been
driven
away
by
the
bacchanals
but
had
succeeded
in
taking
one
of
them
prisoner
whom
with
his
hands
tied
behind
him
they
brought
before
the
king
pentheus
beholding
him
with
wrathful
countenance
said
fellow
you
shall
speedily
be
put
to
death
that
your
fate
may
be
a
warning
to
others
but
though
i
grudge
the
delay
of
your
punishment
speak
tell
us
who
you
are
and
what
are
these
new
rites
you
presume
to
celebrate
the
prisoner
unterrified
responded
my
name
is
acetes
my
country
is
maeonia
my
parents
were
poor
people
who
had
no
fields
or
flocks
to
leave
me
but
they
left
me
their
fishing
rods
and
nets
and
their
fisherman
trade
this
i
followed
for
some
time
till
growing
weary
of
remaining
in
one
place
i
learned
the
pilot
art
and
how
to
guide
my
course
by
the
stars
it
happened
as
i
was
sailing
for
delos
we
touched
at
the
island
of
dia
and
went
ashore
next
morning
i
sent
the
men
for
fresh
water
and
myself
mounted
the
hill
to
observe
the
wind
when
my
men
returned
bringing
with
them
a
prize
as
they
thought
a
boy
of
delicate
appearance
whom
they
had
found
asleep
they
judged
he
was
a
noble
youth
perhaps
a
king
son
and
they
might
get
a
liberal
ransom
for
him
i
observed
his
dress
his
walk
his
face
there
was
something
in
them
which
i
felt
sure
was
more
than
mortal
i
said
to
my
men
god
there
is
concealed
in
that
form
i
know
not
but
some
one
there
certainly
is
pardon
us
gentle
deity
for
the
violence
we
have
done
you
and
give
success
to
our
undertakings
dictys
one
of
my
best
hands
for
climbing
the
mast
and
coming
down
by
the
ropes
and
melanthus
my
steersman
and
epopeus
the
leader
of
the
sailor
cry
one
and
all
exclaimed
your
prayers
for
us
so
blind
is
the
lust
of
gain
when
they
proceeded
to
put
him
on
board
i
resisted
them
ship
shall
not
be
profaned
by
such
impiety
said
i
have
a
greater
share
in
her
than
any
of
you
but
lycabas
a
turbulent
fellow
seized
me
by
the
throat
and
attempted
to
throw
me
overboard
and
i
scarcely
saved
myself
by
clinging
to
the
ropes
the
rest
approved
the
deed
then
bacchus
for
it
was
indeed
he
as
if
shaking
off
his
drowsiness
exclaimed
are
you
doing
with
me
what
is
this
fighting
about
who
brought
me
here
where
are
you
going
to
carry
me
one
of
them
replied
nothing
tell
us
where
you
wish
to
go
and
we
will
take
you
there
is
my
home
said
bacchus
me
there
and
you
shall
be
well
rewarded
they
promised
so
to
do
and
told
me
to
pilot
the
ship
to
naxos
naxos
lay
to
the
right
and
i
was
trimming
the
sails
to
carry
us
there
when
some
by
signs
and
others
by
whispers
signified
to
me
their
will
that
i
should
sail
in
the
opposite
direction
and
take
the
boy
to
egypt
to
sell
him
for
a
slave
i
was
confounded
and
said
some
one
else
pilot
the
ship
withdrawing
myself
from
any
further
agency
in
their
wickedness
they
cursed
me
and
one
of
them
exclaiming
flatter
yourself
that
we
depend
on
you
for
our
safety
took
any
place
as
pilot
and
bore
away
from
naxos
then
the
god
pretending
that
he
had
just
become
aware
of
their
treachery
looked
out
over
the
sea
and
said
in
a
voice
of
weeping
these
are
not
the
shores
you
promised
to
take
me
to
yonder
island
is
not
my
home
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
treat
me
so
it
is
small
glory
you
will
gain
by
cheating
a
poor
boy
i
wept
to
hear
him
but
the
crew
laughed
at
both
of
us
and
sped
the
vessel
fast
over
the
sea
all
at
once
strange
as
it
may
seem
it
is
true
the
vessel
stopped
in
the
mid
sea
as
fast
as
if
it
was
fixed
on
the
ground
the
men
astonished
pulled
at
their
oars
and
spread
more
sail
trying
to
make
progress
by
the
aid
of
both
but
all
in
vain
ivy
twined
round
the
oars
and
hindered
their
motion
and
clung
to
the
sails
with
heavy
clusters
of
berries
a
vine
laden
with
grapes
ran
up
the
mast
and
along
the
sides
of
the
vessel
the
sound
of
flutes
was
heard
and
the
odor
of
fragrant
wine
spread
all
around
the
god
himself
had
a
chaplet
of
vine
leaves
and
bore
in
his
hand
a
spear
wreathed
with
ivy
tigers
crouched
at
his
feet
and
forms
of
lynxes
and
spotted
panthers
played
around
him
the
men
were
seized
with
terror
or
madness
some
leaped
overboard
others
preparing
to
do
the
same
beheld
their
companions
in
the
water
undergoing
a
change
their
bodies
becoming
flattened
and
ending
in
a
crooked
tail
one
exclaimed
miracle
is
this
and
as
he
spoke
his
mouth
widened
his
nostrils
expanded
and
scales
covered
all
his
body
another
endeavoring
to
pull
the
oar
felt
his
hands
shrink
up
and
presently
to
be
no
longer
hands
but
fins
another
trying
to
raise
his
arms
to
a
rope
found
he
had
no
arms
and
curving
his
mutilated
body
jumped
into
the
sea
what
had
been
his
legs
became
the
two
ends
of
a
tail
the
whole
crew
became
dolphins
and
swam
about
the
ship
now
upon
the
surface
now
under
it
scattering
the
spray
and
spouting
the
water
from
their
broad
nostrils
of
twenty
men
i
alone
was
left
trembling
with
fear
the
god
cheered
me
not
said
he
towards
naxos
i
obeyed
and
when
we
arrived
there
i
kindled
the
altars
and
celebrated
the
sacred
rites
of
bacchus
pentheus
here
exclaimed
we
have
wasted
time
enough
on
this
silly
story
take
him
away
and
have
him
executed
without
delay
acetes
was
led
away
by
the
attendants
and
shut
up
fast
in
prison
but
while
they
were
getting
ready
the
instruments
of
execution
the
prison
doors
came
open
of
their
own
accord
and
the
chains
fell
from
his
limbs
and
when
they
looked
for
him
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
pentheus
would
take
no
warning
but
instead
of
sending
others
determined
to
go
himself
to
the
scene
of
the
solemnities
the
mountain
citheron
was
all
alive
with
worshippers
and
the
cries
of
the
bacchanals
resounded
on
every
side
the
noise
roused
the
anger
of
pentheus
as
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
does
the
fire
of
a
horse
he
penetrated
through
the
wood
and
reached
an
open
space
where
the
chief
scene
of
the
orgies
met
his
eyes
at
the
same
moment
the
women
saw
him
and
first
among
them
his
own
mother
agave
blinded
by
the
god
cried
out
see
there
the
wild
boar
the
hugest
monster
that
prowls
in
these
woods
come
on
sisters
i
will
be
the
first
to
strike
the
wild
boar
the
whole
band
rushed
upon
him
and
while
he
now
talks
less
arrogantly
now
excuses
himself
and
now
confesses
his
crime
and
implores
pardon
they
press
upon
him
and
wound
him
in
vain
he
cries
to
his
aunts
to
protect
him
from
his
mother
autonoe
seized
one
arm
ino
the
other
and
between
them
he
was
torn
to
pieces
while
his
mother
shouted
victory
victory
we
have
done
it
the
glory
is
ours
so
the
worship
of
bacchus
was
established
in
greece
there
is
an
allusion
to
the
story
of
bacchus
and
the
mariners
in
milton
comus
at
line
the
story
of
circe
will
be
found
in
chapter
xxix
bacchus
that
first
from
out
the
purple
grapes
crushed
the
sweet
poison

pan
the
god
of
woods
and
fields
of
flocks
and
shepherds
dwelt
in
grottos
wandered
on
the
mountains
and
in
valleys
and
amused
himself
with
the
chase
or
in
leading
the
dances
of
the
nymphs
he
was
fond
of
music
and
as
we
have
seen
the
inventor
of
the
syrinx
or
shepherd
pipe
which
he
himself
played
in
a
masterly
manner
pan
like
other
gods
who
dwelt
in
forests
was
dreaded
by
those
whose
occupations
caused
them
to
pass
through
the
woods
by
night
for
the
gloom
and
loneliness
of
such
scenes
dispose
the
mind
to
superstitious
fears
hence
sudden
fright
without
any
visible
cause
was
ascribed
to
pan
and
called
a
panic
terror
as
the
name
of
the
god
signifies
all
pan
came
to
be
considered
a
symbol
of
the
universe
and
personification
of
nature
and
later
still
to
be
regarded
as
a
representative
of
all
the
gods
and
of
heathenism
itself
sylvanus
and
faunus
were
latin
divinities
whose
characteristics
are
so
nearly
the
same
as
those
of
pan
that
we
may
safely
consider
them
as
the
same
personage
under
different
names
the
pan
partners
in
the
dance
were
but
one
class
of
nymphs
there
were
beside
them
the
naiads
who
presided
over
brooks
and
fountains
the
oreads
nymphs
of
mountains
and
grottos
and
the
nereids
the
three
last
named
were
immortal
but
the
called
dryads
or
hamadryads
were
believed
to
perish
with
the
trees
which
had
been
their
abode
and
with
which
they
had
come
into
existence
it
was
therefore
an
impious
act
wantonly
to
destroy
a
tree
and
in
some
aggravated
cases
were
severely
punished
as
in
the
instance
of
erisichthon
which
we
are
about
to
record
milton
in
his
glowing
description
of
the
early
creation
thus
alludes
to
pan
as
the
personification
of
nature
universal
pan
knit
with
the
graces
and
the
hours
in

led
on
the
eternal
spring

sacred
or
sequestered
though
but

pan
or
sylvanus
never
slept
nor

nor
faunus
haunted
paradise
lost
iv
it
was
a
pleasing
trait
in
the
old
paganism
that
it
loved
to
trace
in
every
operation
of
nature
the
agency
of
deity
the
imagination
of
the
greeks
peopled
all
the
regions
of
earth
and
sea
with
divinities
to
whose
agency
it
attributed
those
phenomena
which
our
philosophy
ascribes
to
the
operation
of
the
laws
of
nature
sometimes
in
our
poetical
moods
we
feel
disposed
to
regret
the
change
and
to
think
that
the
heart
has
lost
as
much
as
the
head
has
gained
by
the
substitution
the
poet
wordsworth
thus
strongly
expresses
this
sentiment

i
standing
on

would
make

hear
old

his

expresses
his
regret
for
the
overthrow
of

of

times

way
which
has
called
forth
an
answer
from
a
christian
poet

in
her
poem

these

tradition
that
when
the

told
the
shepherds
at
bethlehem
of
the
birth
of
christ
a
deep
groan
heard
through
all
the

told
that

and
that

royalty
of

was
dethroned
and

were
sent

erisichthon
erisichthon
was
a
profane
person
and
a
despiser
of
the
gods
on
one
occasion
he
presumed
to
violate
with
the
axe
a
grove
sacred
to
ceres
there
stood
in
this
grove
a
venerable
oak
so
large
that
it
seemed
a
wood
in
itself
its
ancient
trunk
towering
aloft
whereon
votive
garlands
were
often
hung
and
inscriptions
carved
expressing
the
gratitude
of
suppliants
to
the
nymph
of
the
tree
often
had
the
dryads
danced
round
it
hand
in
hand
its
trunk
measured
fifteen
cubits
round
and
it
overtopped
the
other
trees
as
they
overtopped
the
shrubbery
but
for
all
that
erisichthon
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
spare
it
and
he
ordered
his
servants
to
cut
it
down
when
he
saw
them
hesitate
he
snatched
an
axe
from
one
and
thus
impiously
exclaimed
i
care
not
whether
it
be
a
tree
beloved
of
the
goddess
or
not
were
it
the
goddess
herself
it
should
come
down
if
it
stood
in
my
way
so
saying
he
lifted
the
axe
and
the
oak
seemed
to
shudder
and
utter
a
groan
when
the
first
blow
fell
upon
the
trunk
blood
flowed
from
the
wound
all
the
bystanders
were
and
one
of
them
ventured
to
remonstrate
and
hold
back
the
fatal
axe
erisichthon
with
a
scornful
look
said
to
him
receive
the
reward
of
your
piety
and
turned
against
him
the
weapon
which
he
had
held
aside
from
the
tree
gashed
his
body
with
many
wounds
and
cut
off
his
head
then
from
the
midst
of
the
oak
came
a
voice
i
who
dwell
in
this
tree
am
a
nymph
beloved
of
ceres
and
dying
by
your
hands
forewarn
you
that
punishment
awaits
you
he
desisted
not
from
his
crime
and
at
last
the
tree
sundered
by
repeated
blows
and
drawn
by
ropes
fell
with
a
crash
and
prostrated
a
great
part
of
the
grove
in
its
fall
the
dryads
in
dismay
at
the
loss
of
their
companion
and
at
seeing
the
pride
of
the
forest
laid
low
went
in
a
body
to
ceres
all
clad
in
garments
of
mourning
and
invoked
punishment
upon
erisichthon
she
nodded
her
assent
and
as
she
bowed
her
head
the
grain
ripe
for
harvest
in
the
laden
fields
bowed
also
she
planned
a
punishment
so
dire
that
one
would
pity
him
if
such
a
culprit
as
he
could
be
pitied
to
deliver
him
over
to
famine
as
ceres
herself
could
not
approach
famine
for
the
fates
have
ordained
that
these
two
goddesses
shall
never
come
together
she
called
an
oread
from
her
mountain
and
spoke
to
her
in
these
words
there
is
a
place
in
the
farthest
part
of
scythia
a
sad
and
sterile
region
without
trees
and
without
crops
cold
dwells
there
and
fear
and
shuddering
and
famine
go
and
tell
the
last
to
take
possession
of
the
bowels
of
erisichthon
let
not
abundance
subdue
her
nor
the
power
of
my
gifts
drive
her
away
be
not
alarmed
at
the
distance
for
famine
dwells
very
far
from
ceres
but
take
my
chariot
the
dragons
are
fleet
and
obey
the
rein
and
will
take
you
through
the
air
in
a
short
time
so
she
gave
her
the
reins
and
she
drove
away
and
soon
reached
scythia
on
arriving
at
mount
caucasus
she
stopped
the
dragons
and
found
famine
in
a
stony
field
pulling
up
with
teeth
and
claws
the
scanty
herbage
her
hair
was
rough
her
eyes
sunk
her
face
pale
her
lips
blanched
her
jaws
covered
with
dust
and
her
skin
drawn
tight
so
as
to
show
all
her
bones
as
the
oread
saw
her
afar
off
for
she
did
not
dare
to
come
near
she
delivered
the
commands
of
ceres
and
though
she
stopped
as
short
a
time
as
possible
and
kept
her
distance
as
well
as
she
could
yet
she
began
to
feel
hungry
and
turned
the
dragons
heads
and
drove
back
to
thessaly
famine
obeyed
the
commands
of
ceres
and
sped
through
the
air
to
the
dwelling
of
erisichthon
entered
the
bedchamber
of
the
guilty
man
and
found
him
asleep
she
enfolded
him
with
her
wings
and
breathed
herself
into
him
infusing
her
poison
into
his
veins
having
discharged
her
task
she
hastened
to
leave
the
land
of
plenty
and
returned
to
her
accustomed
haunts
erisichthon
still
slept
and
in
his
dreams
craved
food
and
moved
his
jaws
as
if
eating
when
he
awoke
his
hunger
was
raging
without
a
delay
he
would
have
food
set
before
him
of
whatever
kind
earth
sea
or
air
produces
and
complained
of
hunger
even
while
he
ate
what
would
have
sufficed
for
a
city
or
a
nation
was
not
enough
for
him
the
more
he
ate
the
more
he
craved
his
hunger
was
like
the
sea
which
receives
all
the
rivers
yet
is
never
filled
or
like
fire
that
burns
all
the
fuel
that
is
heaped
upon
it
yet
is
still
voracious
for
more
his
property
rapidly
diminished
under
the
unceasing
demands
of
his
appetite
but
his
hunger
continued
unabated
at
length
he
had
spent
all
and
had
only
his
daughter
left
a
daughter
worthy
of
a
better
parent
her
too
he
sold
she
scorned
to
be
the
slave
of
a
purchaser
and
as
she
stood
by
the
seaside
raised
her
hands
in
prayer
to
neptune
he
heard
her
prayer
and
though
her
new
master
was
not
far
off
and
had
his
eye
upon
her
a
moment
before
neptune
changed
her
form
and
made
her
assume
that
of
a
fisherman
busy
at
his
occupation
her
master
looking
for
her
and
seeing
her
in
her
altered
form
addressed
her
and
said
good
fisherman
whither
went
the
maiden
whom
i
saw
just
now
with
hair
dishevelled
and
in
humble
garb
standing
about
where
you
stand
tell
me
truly
so
may
your
luck
be
good
and
not
a
fish
nibble
at
your
hook
and
get
away
she
perceived
that
her
prayer
was
answered
and
rejoiced
inwardly
at
hearing
herself
inquired
of
about
herself
she
replied
pardon
me
stranger
but
i
have
been
so
intent
upon
my
line
that
i
have
seen
nothing
else
but
i
wish
i
may
never
catch
another
fish
if
i
believe
any
woman
or
other
person
except
myself
to
have
been
hereabouts
for
some
time
he
was
deceived
and
went
his
way
thinking
his
slave
had
escaped
then
she
resumed
her
own
form
her
father
was
well
pleased
to
find
her
still
with
him
and
the
money
too
that
he
got
by
the
sale
of
her
so
he
sold
her
again
but
she
was
changed
by
the
favor
of
neptune
as
often
as
she
was
sold
now
into
a
horse
now
a
bird
now
an
ox
and
now
a
stag
got
away
from
her
purchasers
and
came
home
by
this
base
method
the
starving
father
procured
food
but
not
enough
for
his
wants
and
at
last
hunger
compelled
him
to
devour
his
limbs
and
he
strove
to
nourish
his
body
by
eating
his
body
till
death
relieved
him
from
the
vengeance
of
ceres
rhoecus
the
hamadryads
could
appreciate
services
as
well
as
punish
injuries
the
story
of
rhoecus
proves
this
rhoecus
happening
to
see
an
oak
just
ready
to
fall
ordered
his
servants
to
prop
it
up
the
nymph
who
had
been
on
the
point
of
perishing
with
the
tree
came
and
expressed
her
gratitude
to
him
for
having
saved
her
life
and
bade
him
ask
what
reward
he
would
rhoecus
boldly
asked
her
love
and
the
nymph
yielded
to
his
desire
she
at
the
same
time
charged
him
to
be
constant
and
told
him
that
a
bee
should
be
her
messenger
and
let
him
know
when
she
would
admit
his
society
one
time
the
bee
came
to
rhoecus
when
he
was
playing
at
draughts
and
he
carelessly
brushed
it
away
this
so
incensed
the
nymph
that
she
deprived
him
of
sight
our
countryman
lowell
has
taken
this
story
for
the
subject
of
one
of
his
shorter
poems
he
introduces
it
thus
hear
now
this
fairy
legend
of
old
greece
as
full
of
freedom

and

neptune
neptune
was
the
chief
of

the
symbol

with
which
he
used
to
shatter

to
call
forth
or
subdue

created

achelous

the

told
the

of
erisichthon
to
theseus
and
his
companions
whom
he
was
entertaining
at
his
hospitable
board
while
they
were
delayed
on
their
journey
by
the
overflow
of
his
waters
having
finished
his
story
he
added
but
why
should
i
tell
of
other
persons
transformations
when
i
myself
am
an
instance
of
the
possession
of
this
power
sometimes
i
become
a
serpent
and
sometimes
a
bull
with
horns
on
my
head
or
i
should
say
i
once
could
do
so
but
now
i
have
but
one
horn
having
lost
one
and
here
he
groaned
and
was
silent
theseus
asked
him
the
cause
of
his
grief
and
how
he
lost
his
horn
to
which
question
the
replied
as
follows
who
likes
to
tell
of
his
defeats
yet
i
will
not
hesitate
to
relate
mine
comforting
myself
with
the
thought
of
the
greatness
of
my
conqueror
for
it
was
hercules
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
the
fame
of
dejanira
the
fairest
of
maidens
whom
a
host
of
suitors
strove
to
win
hercules
and
myself
were
of
the
number
and
the
rest
yielded
to
us
two
he
urged
in
his
behalf
his
descent
from
jove
and
his
labors
by
which
he
had
exceeded
the
exactions
of
juno
his
stepmother
i
on
the
other
hand
said
to
the
father
of
the
maiden
me
the
king
of
the
waters
that
flow
through
your
land
i
am
no
stranger
from
a
foreign
shore
but
belong
to
the
country
a
part
of
your
realm
let
it
not
stand
in
my
way
that
royal
juno
owes
me
no
enmity
nor
punishes
me
with
heavy
tasks
as
for
this
man
who
boasts
himself
the
son
of
jove
it
is
either
a
false
pretence
or
disgraceful
to
him
if
true
for
it
can
not
be
true
except
by
his
mother
shame
as
i
said
this
hercules
scowled
upon
me
and
with
difficulty
restrained
his
rage
hand
will
answer
better
than
my
tongue
said
he
yield
to
you
the
victory
in
words
but
trust
my
cause
to
the
strife
of
deeds
with
that
he
advanced
towards
me
and
i
was
ashamed
after
what
i
had
said
to
yield
i
threw
off
my
green
vesture
and
presented
myself
for
the
struggle
he
tried
to
throw
me
now
attacking
my
head
now
my
body
my
bulk
was
my
protection
and
he
assailed
me
in
vain
for
a
time
we
stopped
then
returned
to
the
conflict
we
each
kept
our
position
determined
not
to
yield
foot
to
foot
i
bending
over
him
clenching
his
hand
in
mine
with
my
forehead
almost
touching
his
thrice
hercules
tried
to
throw
me
off
and
the
fourth
time
he
succeeded
brought
me
to
the
ground
and
himself
upon
my
back
i
tell
you
the
truth
it
was
as
if
a
mountain
had
fallen
on
me
i
struggled
to
get
my
arms
at
liberty
panting
and
reeking
with
perspiration
he
gave
me
no
chance
to
recover
but
seized
my
throat
my
knees
were
on
the
earth
and
my
mouth
in
the
dust
finding
that
i
was
no
match
for
him
in
the
warrior
art
i
resorted
to
others
and
glided
away
in
the
form
of
a
serpent
i
curled
my
body
in
a
coil
and
hissed
at
him
with
my
forked
tongue
he
smiled
scornfully
at
this
and
said
was
the
labor
of
my
infancy
to
conquer
snakes
so
saying
he
clasped
my
neck
with
his
hands
i
was
almost
choked
and
struggled
to
get
my
neck
out
of
his
grasp
vanquished
in
this
form
i
tried
what
alone
remained
to
me
and
assumed
the
form
of
a
bull
he
grasped
my
neck
with
his
arm
and
dragging
my
head
down
to
the
ground
overthrew
me
on
the
sand
nor
was
this
enough
his
ruthless
hand
rent
my
horn
from
my
head
the
naiades
took
it
consecrated
it
and
filled
it
with
fragrant
flowers
plenty
adopted
my
horn
and
made
it
her
own
and
called
it
the
ancients
were
fond
of
finding
a
hidden
meaning
in
their
mythological
tales
they
explain
this
fight
of
achelous
with
hercules
by
saying
achelous
was
a
river
that
in
seasons
of
rain
overflowed
its
banks
when
the
fable
says
that
achelous
loved
dejanira
and
sought
a
union
with
her
the
meaning
is
that
the
river
in
its
windings
flowed
through
part
of
dejanira
kingdom
it
was
said
to
take
the
form
of
a
snake
because
of
its
winding
and
of
a
bull
because
it
made
a
brawling
or
roaring
in
its
course
when
the
river
swelled
it
made
itself
another
channel
thus
its
head
was
horned
hercules
prevented
the
return
of
these
periodical
overflows
by
embankments
and
canals
and
therefore
he
was
said
to
have
vanquished
the
and
cut
off
his
horn
finally
the
lands
formerly
subject
to
overflow
but
now
redeemed
became
very
fertile
and
this
is
meant
by
the
horn
of
plenty
there
is
another
account
of
the
origin
of
the
cornucopia
jupiter
at
his
birth
was
committed
by
his
mother
rhea
to
the
care
of
the
daughters
of
melisseus
a
cretan
king
they
fed
the
infant
deity
with
the
milk
of
the
goat
amalthea
jupiter
broke
off
one
of
the
horns
of
the
goat
and
gave
it
to
his
nurses
and
endowed
it
with
the
wonderful
power
of
becoming
filled
with
whatever
the
possessor
might
wish
the
name
of
amalthea
is
also
given
by
some
writers
to
the
mother
of
bacchus
it
is
thus
used
by
milton
paradise
lost
book
iv
that
nyseian
isle
girt
with
the
river
triton
where
old
cham
whom
gentiles
ammon
call
and

jove
hid
amalthea
and
her
florid
son
young
bacchus
from
his
stepdame
rhea
eye
admetus
and
alcestis
aesculapius
the
son
of
apollo
was
endowed
by
his
father
with
such
skill
in
the
healing
art
that
he
even
restored
the
dead
to
life
at
this
pluto
took
alarm
and
prevailed
on
jupiter
to
launch
a
thunderbolt
at
aesculapius
apollo
was
indignant
at
the
destruction
of
his
son
and
wreaked
his
vengeance
on
the
innocent
workmen
who
had
made
the
thunderbolt
these
were
the
cyclopes
who
have
their
workshop
under
mount
aetna
from
which
the
smoke
and
flames
of
their
furnaces
are
constantly
issuing
apollo
shot
his
arrows
at
the
cyclopes
which
so
incensed
jupiter
that
he
condemned
him
as
a
punishment
to
become
the
servant
of
a
mortal
for
the
space
of
one
year
accordingly
apollo
went
into
the
service
of
admetus
king
of
thessaly
and
pastured
his
flocks
for
him
on
the
verdant
banks
of
the
river
amphrysos
admetus
was
a
suitor
with
others
for
the
hand
of
alcestis
the
daughter
of
pelias
who
promised
her
to
him
who
should
come
for
her
in
a
chariot
drawn
by
lions
and
boars
this
task
admetus
performed
by
the
assistance
of
his
divine
herdsman
and
was
made
happy
in
the
possession
of
alcestis
but
admetus
fell
ill
and
being
near
to
death
apollo
prevailed
on
the
fates
to
spare
him
on
condition
that
some
one
would
consent
to
die
in
his
stead
admetus
in
his
joy
at
this
reprieve
thought
little
of
the
ransom
and
perhaps
remembering
the
declarations
of
attachment
which
he
had
often
heard
from
his
courtiers
and
dependents
fancied
that
it
would
be
easy
to
find
a
substitute
but
it
was
not
so
brave
warriors
who
would
willingly
have
perilled
their
lives
for
their
prince
shrunk
from
the
thought
of
dying
for
him
on
the
bed
of
sickness
and
old
servants
who
had
experienced
his
bounty
and
that
of
his
house
from
their
childhood
up
were
not
willing
to
lay
down
the
scanty
remnant
of
their
days
to
show
their
gratitude
men
asked
why
does
not
one
of
his
parents
do
it
they
can
not
in
the
course
of
nature
live
much
longer
and
who
can
feel
like
them
the
call
to
rescue
the
life
they
gave
from
an
untimely
end
but
the
parents
distressed
though
they
were
at
the
thought
of
losing
him
shrunk
from
the
call
then
alcestis
with
a
generous
devotion
proffered
herself
as
the
substitute
admetus
fond
as
he
was
of
life
would
not
have
submitted
to
receive
it
at
such
a
cost
but
there
was
no
remedy
the
condition
imposed
by
the
fates
had
been
met
and
the
decree
was
irrevocable
alcestis
sickened
as
admetus
revived
and
she
was
rapidly
sinking
to
the
grave
just
at
this
time
hercules
arrived
at
the
palace
of
admetus
and
found
all
the
inmates
in
great
distress
for
the
impending
loss
of
the
devoted
wife
and
beloved
mistress
hercules
to
whom
no
labor
was
too
arduous
resolved
to
attempt
her
rescue
he
went
and
lay
in
wait
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
of
the
dying
queen
and
when
death
came
for
his
prey
he
seized
him
and
forced
him
to
resign
his
victim
alcestis
recovered
and
was
restored
to
her
husband
milton
alludes
to
the
story
of
alcestis
in
his
sonnet
on
his
deceased
wife
methought
i
saw
my
late
espoused
saint
brought
to
me
like
alcestis

the

makes
that
event

a
shiftless
youth

whom
no
good
they
saw

yet
unwittingly
in
truth
they
made
his
careless
words
their
law

by

shared
his
wanderings
and
remained
with

her
brothers
eteocles

polynices
had
agreed
to

the

when

expired
refused
to
surrender
the
kingdom
to
his
brother

fled
to
adrastus
king
of
argos
who
gave
him
his
daughter
in
marriage
and
aided
him
with
an
army
to
enforce
his
claim
to
the
kingdom
this
led
to
the
celebrated
expedition
of
the
seven
against
thebes
which
furnished
ample
materials
for
the
epic
and
tragic
poets
of
greece
amphiaraus
the
of
adrastus
opposed
the
enterprise
for
he
was
a
soothsayer
and
knew
by
his
art
that
no
one
of
the
leaders
except
adrastus
would
live
to
return
but
amphiaraus
on
his
marriage
to
eriphyle
the
king
sister
had
agreed
that
whenever
he
and
adrastus
should
differ
in
opinion
the
decision
should
be
left
to
eriphyle
polynices
knowing
this
gave
eriphyle
the
collar
of
harmonia
and
thereby
gained
her
to

this
collar

necklace
was
a
present
which

eriphyle
could
not

so
tempting
a
bribe
and
by
her
decision
the
war
was
resolved
on

amphiaraus
went
to
his
certain
fate
he
bore
his

bravely
in

it
would

here
to
detail
all
the
acts
of
heroism
or
atrocity
which
marked
the
contest
but
we
must
not
omit
to
record
the
fidelity
of
evadne
as
an
offset
to
the
weakness
of
eriphyle
capaneus
the
husband
of
evadne
in
the
ardor
of
the
fight
declared
that
he
would
force
his
way
into
the
city
in

of

placing

mounted

offended
at
his
impious

struck
him
with
a
thunderbolt

were
celebrated
evadne
cast
herself
on

funeral
pile
and
perished
early
in
the
contest
eteocles
consulted
the
soothsayer
tiresias

to
the
issue
tiresias
in
his
youth
had
by
chance
seen
minerva
bathing
the
goddess
in
her
wrath
deprived
him
of
his
sight
but
afterwards
relenting
gave
him
in
compensation
the
knowledge
of
future
events
when
consulted
by
eteocles
he
declared
that
victory
should
fall
to

decide
their
quarrel
by
single
combat
they
fought
and
fell
by
each
other
hands

armies

renewed
the
fight
and
at
last
the

were
forced
to
yield
and
fled

the
uncle
of
the
fallen

caused
eteocles
to
be

with
distinguished
honor
but

lie
where
it
fell
forbidding
every
one
on
pain
of
death
to
give
it

the
sister
of

heard
with
indignation
the
revolting
edict
which
consigned
her

to
the
dogs

depriving
it
of
those
rites
which
were
considered
essential

the
repose
of
the
dead
unmoved
by
the
dissuading
counsel
of
an
affectionate
but
timid

and
unable

procure

she
determined
to
brave
the
hazard
and
to
bury
the
body
with
her
own
hands
she
was
detected
in
the
act
and
creon
gave
orders
that
she
should
be
buried
alive

having
deliberately
set
at
naught
the
solemn
edict
of
the
city
her
lover

penelope
is
another
of
those
mythic
heroines
whose
beauties
were
rather
those
of
character
and
conduct
than
of
person
she
was
the
daughter
of
icarius
a
spartan
prince
ulysses
king
of
ithaca
sought
her
in
marriage
and
won
her
over
all
competitors
when
the
moment
came
for
the
bride
to
leave
her
father
house
icarius
unable
to
bear
the
thoughts
of
parting
with
his
daughter
tried
to
persuade
her
to
remain
with
him
and
not
accompany
her
husband
to
ithaca
ulysses
gave
penelope
her
choice
to
stay
or
go
with
him
penelope
made
no
reply
but
dropped
her
veil
over
her
face
icarius
urged
her
no
further
but
when
she
was
gone
erected
a
statue
to
modesty
on
the
spot
where
they
parted
ulysses
and
penelope
had
not
enjoyed
their
union
more
than
a
year
when
it
was
interrupted
by
the
events
which
called
ulysses
to
the
trojan
war
during
his
long
absence
and
when
it
was
doubtful
whether
he
still
lived
and
highly
improbable
that
he
would
ever
return
penelope
was
importuned
by
numerous
suitors
from
whom
there
seemed
no
refuge
but
in
choosing
one
of
them
for
her
husband
penelope
however
employed
every
art
to
gain
time
still
hoping
for
ulysses
return
one
of
her
arts
of
delay
was
engaging
in
the
preparation
of
a
robe
for
the
funeral
canopy
of
laertes
her
husband
father
she
pledged
herself
to
make
her
choice
among
the
suitors
when
the
robe
was
finished
during
the
day
she
worked
at
the
robe
but
in
the
night
she
undid
the
work
of
the
day

for
anything

musaeus
orpheus
and
eurydice
orpheus
was
the
son
of
apollo
and
the
muse
calliope
he
was
presented
by
his
father
with
a
lyre
and
taught
to
play
upon
it
which
he
did
to
such
perfection
that
nothing
could
withstand
the
charm
of
his
music
not
only
his
but
wild
beasts
were
softened
by
his
strains
and
gathering
round
him
laid
by
their
fierceness
and
stood
entranced
with
his
lay
nay
the
very
trees
and
rocks
were
sensible
to
the
charm
the
former
crowded
round
him
and
the
latter
relaxed
somewhat
of
their
hardness
softened
by
his
notes
hymen
had
been
called
to
bless
with
his
presence
the
nuptials
of
orpheus
with
eurydice
but
though
he
attended
he
brought
no
happy
omens
with
him
his
very
torch
smoked
and
brought
tears
into
their
eyes
in
coincidence
with
such
prognostics
eurydice
shortly
after
her
marriage
while
wandering
with
the
nymphs
her
companions
was
seen
by
the
shepherd
aristaeus
who
was
struck
with
her
beauty
and
made
advances
to
her
she
fled
and
in
flying
trod
upon
a
snake
in
the
grass
was
bitten
in
the
foot
and
died
orpheus
sang
his
grief
to
all
who
breathed
the
upper
air
both
gods
and
men
and
finding
it
all
unavailing
resolved
to
seek
his
wife
in
the
regions
of
the
dead
he
descended
by
a
cave
situated
on
the
side
of
the
promontory
of
taenarus
and
arrived
at
the
stygian
realm
he
passed
through
crowds
of
ghosts
and
presented
himself
before
the
throne
of
pluto
and
proserpine
accompanying
the
words
with
the
lyre
he
sung
o
deities
of
the
underworld
to
whom
all
we
who
live
must
come
hear
my
words
for
they
are
true
i
come
not
to
spy
out
the
secrets
of
tartarus
nor
to
try
my
strength
against
the
dog
with
snaky
hair
who
guards
the
entrance
i
come
to
seek
my
wife
whose
opening
years
the
poisonous
viper
fang
has
brought
to
an
untimely
end
love
has
led
me
here
love
a
god
all
powerful
with
us
who
dwell
on
the
earth
and
if
old
traditions
say
true
not
less
so
here
i
implore
you
by
these
abodes
full
of
terror
these
realms
of
silence
and
uncreated
things
unite
again
the
thread
of
life
we
all
are
destined
to
you
and
sooner
or
later
must
pass
to
your
domain
she
too
when
she
shall
have
filled
her
term
of
life
will
rightly
be
yours
but
till
then
grant
her
to
me
i
beseech
you
if
you
deny
me
i
can
not
return
alone
you
shall
triumph
in
the
death
of
us
both
as
he
sang
these
tender
strains
the
very
ghosts
shed
tears
tantalus
in
spite
of
his
thirst
stopped
for
a
moment
his
efforts
for
water
ixion
wheel
stood
still
the
vulture
ceased
to
tear
the
giant
liver
the
daughters
of
danaus
rested
from
their
task
of
drawing
water
in
a
sieve
and
sisyphus
sat
on
his
rock
to
listen
then
for
the
first
time
it
is
said
the
cheeks
of
the
furies
were
wet
with
tears
proserpine
could
not
resist
and
pluto
himself
gave
way
eurydice
was
called
she
came
from
among
the
ghosts
limping
with
her
wounded
foot
orpheus
was
permitted
to
take
her
away
with
him
on
one
condition
that
he
should
not
turn
around
to
look
at
her
till
they
should
have
reached
the
upper
air
under
this
condition
they
proceeded
on
their
way
he
leading
she
following
through
passages
dark
and
steep
in
total
silence
till
they
had
nearly
reached
the
outlet
into
the
cheerful
upper
world
when
orpheus
in
a
moment
of
forgetfulness
to
assure
himself
that
she
was
still
following
cast
a
glance
behind
him
when
instantly
she
was
borne
away
stretching
out
their
arms
to
embrace
each
other
they
grasped
only
the
air
dying
now
a
second
time
she
yet
can
not
reproach
her
husband
for
how
can
she
blame
his
impatience
to
behold
her
farewell
she
said
a
last
farewell
and
was
hurried
away
so
fast
that
the
sound
hardly
reached
his
ears
orpheus
endeavored
to
follow
her
and
besought
permission
to
return
and
try
once
more
for
her
release
but
the
stern
ferryman
repulsed
him
and
refused
passage
seven
days
he
lingered
about
the
brink
without
food
or
sleep
then
bitterly
accusing
of
cruelty
the
powers
of
erebus
he
sang
his
complaints
to
the
rocks
and
mountains
melting
the
hearts
of
tigers
and
moving
the
oaks
from
their
stations
he
held
himself
aloof
from
womankind
dwelling
constantly
on
the
recollection
of
his
sad
mischance
the
thracian
maidens
tried
their
best
to
captivate
him
but
he
repulsed
their
advances
they
bore
with
him
as
long
as
they
could
but
finding
him
insensible
one
day
excited
by
the
rites
of
bacchus
one
of
them
exclaimed
see
yonder
our
despiser
and
threw
at
him
her
javelin
the
weapon
as
soon
as
it
came
within
the
sound
of
his
lyre
fell
harmless
at
his
feet
so
did
also
the
stones
that
they
threw
at
him
but
the
women
raised
a
scream
and
drowned
the
voice
of
the
music
and
then
the
missiles
reached
him
and
soon
were
stained
with
his
blood
the
maniacs
tore
him
limb
from
limb
and
threw
his
head
and
his
lyre
into
the
river
hebrus
down
which
they
floated
murmuring
sad
music
to
which
the
shores
responded
a
plaintive
symphony
the
muses
gathered
up
the
fragments
of
his
body
and
buried
them
at
libethra
where
the
nightingale
is
said
to
sing
over
his
grave
more
sweetly
than
in
any
other
part
of
greece
his
lyre
was
placed
by
jupiter
among
the
stars
his
shade
passed
a
second
time
to
tartarus
where
he
sought
out
his
eurydice
and
embraced
her
with
eager
arms
they
roam
the
happy
fields
together
now
sometimes
he
leading
sometimes
she
and
orpheus
gazes
as
much
as
he
will
upon
her
no
longer
incurring
a
penalty
for
a
thoughtless
glance
the
story
of
orpheus
has
furnished
pope
with
an
illustration
of
the
power
of
music
for
his
ode
for
cecilia
day
the
following
stanza
relates
the
conclusion
of
the
story
but
soon
too
soon
the
lover
turns
his
eyes
again
she
falls
again
she
dies
she
dies
how
wilt
thou
now
the
fatal
sisters
move
no
crime
was
thine
is
no
crime
to
love
now
under
hanging
mountains
beside
the
falls
of
fountains
or
where
hebrus
wanders
rolling
in
meanders
all
alone
he
makes
his
moan
and
calls
her
ghost
forever
ever
ever
lost
now
with
furies
surrounded
despairing
confounded
he
trembles
he
glows
amidst
rhodope
snows
see
wild
as
the
winds
the
desert
he
flies
hark
haemus
resounds
with
the
bacchanals
cries
ah
see
he
dies
yet
even
in
death
eurydice
he
sung

trembled
on
his

the
superior
melody
of
the
nightingale
song
over
the
grave
of
orpheus
is
alluded
to
by
southey
in
his

then
on
his
ear
what
sounds
of

music
and
the
song
from

never
from
that
most
melodious
bird
singing
a

song
to
his
brooding
mate
did
thracian
shepherd
by
the
grave
of

hear
a
sweeter
melody

there
the
spirit
of
the
sepulchre
all
his
own
power
infuse
to
swell
the
incense
that
he
loves
aristaeus
the
man
avails
himself
of
the
instincts
of
the
inferior
animals
for
his
own
advantage
hence
sprang
the
art
of
keeping
bees
honey
must
first
have
been
known
as
a
wild
product
the
bees
building
their
structures
in
hollow
trees
or
holes
in
the
rocks
or
any
similar
cavity
that
chance
offered
thus
occasionally
the
carcass
of
a
dead
animal
would
be
occupied
by
the
bees
for
that
purpose
it
was
no
doubt
from
some
such
incident
that
the
superstition
arose
that
the
bees
were
engendered
by
the
decaying
flesh
of
the
animal
and
virgil
in
the
following
story
shows
how
this
supposed
fact
may
be
turned
to
account
for
renewing
the
swarm
when
it
has
been
lost
by
disease
or
accident
aristaeus
who
first
taught
the
management
of
bees
was
the
son
of
the
cyrene
his
bees
had
perished
and
he
resorted
for
aid
to
his
mother
he
stood
at
the
river
side
and
thus
addressed
her
o
mother
the
pride
of
my
life
is
taken
from
me
i
have
lost
my
precious
bees
my
care
and
skill
have
availed
me
nothing
and
you
my
mother
have
not
warded
off
from
me
the
blow
of
misfortune
his
mother
heard
these
complaints
as
she
sat
in
her
palace
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
with
her
attendant
nymphs
around
her
they
were
engaged
in
female
occupations
spinning
and
weaving
while
one
told
stories
to
amuse
the
rest
the
sad
voice
of
aristaeus
interrupting
their
occupation
one
of
them
put
her
head
above
the
water
and
seeing
him
returned
and
gave
information
to
his
mother
who
ordered
that
he
should
be
brought
into
her
presence
the
river
at
her
command
opened
itself
and
let
him
pass
in
while
it
stood
curled
like
a
mountain
on
either
side
he
descended
to
the
region
where
the
fountains
of
the
great
rivers
lie
he
saw
the
enormous
receptacles
of
waters
and
was
almost
deafened
with
the
roar
while
he
surveyed
them
hurrying
off
in
various
directions
to
water
the
face
of
the
earth
arriving
at
his
mother
apartment
he
was
hospitably
received
by
cyrene
and
her
nymphs
who
spread
their
table
with
the
richest
dainties
they
first
poured
out
libations
to
neptune
then
regaled
themselves
with
the
feast
and
after
that
cyrene
thus
addressed
him
there
is
an
old
prophet
named
proteus
who
dwells
in
the
sea
and
is
a
favorite
of
neptune
whose
herd
of
he
pastures
we
nymphs
hold
him
in
great
respect
for
he
is
a
learned
sage
and
knows
all
things
past
present
and
to
come
he
can
tell
you
my
son
the
cause
of
the
mortality
among
your
bees
and
how
you
may
remedy
it
but
he
will
not
do
it
voluntarily
however
you
may
entreat
him
you
must
compel
him
by
force
if
you
seize
him
and
chain
him
he
will
answer
your
questions
in
order
to
get
released
for
he
can
not
by
all
his
arts
get
away
if
you
hold
fast
the
chains
i
will
carry
you
to
his
cave
where
he
comes
at
noon
to
take
his
midday
repose
then
you
may
easily
secure
him
but
when
he
finds
himself
captured
his
resort
is
to
a
power
he
possesses
of
changing
himself
into
various
forms
he
will
become
a
wild
boar
or
a
fierce
tiger
a
scaly
dragon
or
lion
with
yellow
mane
or
he
will
make
a
noise
like
the
crackling
of
flames
or
the
rush
of
water
so
as
to
tempt
you
to
let
go
the
chain
when
he
will
make
his
escape
but
you
have
only
to
keep
him
fast
bound
and
at
last
when
he
finds
all
his
arts
unavailing
he
will
return
to
his
own
figure
and
obey
your
commands
so
saying
she
sprinkled
her
son
with
fragrant
nectar
the
beverage
of
the
gods
and
immediately
an
unusual
vigor
filled
his
frame
and
courage
his
heart
while
perfume
breathed
all
around
him
the
nymph
led
her
son
to
the
prophet
cave
and
concealed
him
among
the
recesses
of
the
rocks
while
she
herself
took
her
place
behind
the
clouds
when
noon
came
and
the
hour
when
men
and
herds
retreat
from
the
glaring
sun
to
indulge
in
quiet
slumber
proteus
issued
from
the
water
followed
by
his
herd
of
which
spread
themselves
along
the
shore
he
sat
on
the
rock
and
counted
his
herd
then
stretched
himself
on
the
floor
of
the
cave
and
went
to
sleep
aristaeus
hardly
allowed
him
to
get
fairly
asleep
before
he
fixed
the
fetters
on
him
and
shouted
aloud
proteus
waking
and
finding
himself
captured
immediately
resorted
to
his
arts
becoming
first
a
fire
then
a
flood
then
a
horrible
wild
beast
in
rapid
succession
but
finding
all
would
not
do
he
at
last
resumed
his
own
form
and
addressed
the
youth
in
angry
accents
who
are
you
bold
youth
who
thus
invade
my
abode
and
what
do
yot
want
of
me
aristaeus
replied
proteus
you
know
already
for
it
is
needless
for
any
one
to
attempt
to
deceive
you
and
do
you
also
cease
your
efforts
to
elude
me
i
am
led
hither
by
divine
assistance
to
know
from
you
the
cause
of
my
misfortune
and
how
to
remedy
it
at
these
words
the
prophet
fixing
on
him
his
gray
eyes
with
a
piercing
look
thus
spoke
you
receive
the
merited
reward
of
your
deeds
by
which
eurydice
met
her
death
for
in
flying
from
you
she
trod
upon
a
serpent
of
whose
bite
she
died
to
avenge
her
death
the
nymphs
her
companions
have
sent
this
destruction
to
your
bees
you
have
to
appease
their
anger
and
thus
it
must
be
done
select
four
bulls
of
perfect
form
and
size
and
four
cows
of
equal
beauty
build
four
altars
to
the
nymphs
and
sacrifice
the
animals
leaving
their
carcasses
in
the
leafy
grove
to
orpheus
and
eurydice
you
shall
pay
such
funeral
honors
as
may
allay
their
resentment
returning
after
nine
days
you
will
examine
the
bodies
of
the
cattle
slain
and
see
what
will
befall
aristaeus
faithfully
obeyed
these
directions
he
sacrificed
the
cattle
he
left
their
bodies
in
the
grove
he
offered
funeral
honors
to
the
shades
of
orpheus
and
eurydice
then
returning
on
the
ninth
day
he
examined
the
bodies
of
the
animals
and
wonderful
to

a
swarm
of

had
taken
possession
of
one
of
the
carcasses
and
were
pursuing
their
labors
there

the

some
of
whose

yet

and
their

on

who

the

arion
was
a

and
dwelt
in

of
periander
king
of

with
whom
he
was
a
great
favorite
there
was
to
be

and
arion
longed
to
compete
for
the

he
told
his
wish
to
periander
who
besought
him
like
a
brother
to
give
up
the
thought
pray
stay
with
me
he
said
and
be
contented
he
who
strives
to
win
may
lose
arion
answered
a
wandering
life
best
suits
the
free
heart
of
a
poet
the
talent
which
a
god
bestowed
on
me
i
would
fain
make
a
source
of
pleasure
to
others
and
if
i
win
the
prize
how
will
the
enjoyment
of
it
be
increased
by
the
consciousness
of
my
widespread
fame
he
went
won
the
prize
and
embarked
with
his
wealth
in
a
corinthian
ship
for
home
on
the
second
morning
after
setting
sail
the
wind
breathed
mild
and
fair
o
periander
he
exclaimed
dismiss
your
fears
soon
shall
you
forget
them
in
my
embrace
with
what
lavish
offerings
will
we
display
our
gratitude
to
the
gods
and
how
merry
will
we
be
at
the
festal
board
the
wind
and
sea
continued
propitious
not
a
cloud
dimmed
the
firmament
he
had
not
trusted
too
much
to
the
ocean
but
he
had
to
man
he
overheard
the
seamen
exchanging
hints
with
one
another
and
found
they
were
plotting
to
possess
themselves
of
his
treasure
presently
they
surrounded
him
loud
and
mutinous
and
said
arion
you
must
die
if
you
would
have
a
grave
on
shore
yield
yourself
to
die
on
this
spot
but
if
otherwise
cast
yourself
into
the
sea
will
nothing
satisfy
you
but
my
life
said
he
take
my
gold
and
welcome
i
willingly
buy
my
life
at
that
price
no
no
we
can
not
spare
you
your
life
would
be
too
dangerous
to
us
where
could
we
go
to
escape
from
periander
if
he
should
know
that
you
had
been
robbed
by
us
your
gold
would
be
of
little
use
to
us
if
on
returning
home
we
could
never
more
be
free
from
fear
grant
me
then
said
he
a
last
request
since
nought
will
avail
to
save
my
life
that
i
may
die
as
i
have
lived
as
becomes
a
bard
when
i
shall
have
sung
my
death
song
and
my
shall
have
ceased
to
vibrate
then
i
will
bid
farewell
to
life
and
yield
uncomplaining
to
my
fate
this
prayer
like
the
others
would
have
been
unheeded
they
thought
only
of
their
booty
but
to
hear
so
famous
a
musician
that
moved
their
rude
hearts
suffer
me
he
added
to
arrange
my
dress
apollo
will
not
favor
me
unless
i
be
clad
in
my
minstrel
garb
he
clothed
his
limbs
in
gold
and
purple
fair
to
see
his
tunic
fell
around
him
in
graceful
folds
jewels
adorned
his
arms
his
brow
was
crowned
with
a
golden
wreath
and
over
his
neck
and
shoulders
flowed
his
hair
perfumed
with
odors
his
left
hand
held
the
lyre
his
right
the
ivory
wand
with
which
he
struck
its
chords
like
one
inspired
he
seemed
to
drink
the
morning
air
and
glitter
in
the
morning
ray
the
seamen
gazed
with
admiration
he
strode
forward
to
the
vessel
side
and
looked
down
into
the
deep
blue
sea
addressing
his
lyre
he
sang
companion
of
my
voice
come
with
me
to
the
realm
of
shades
though
cerberus
may
growl
we
know
the
power
of
song
can
tame
his
rage
ye
heroes
of
elysium
who
have
passed
the
darkling
flood
ye
happy
souls
soon
shall
i
join
your
band
yet
can
ye
relieve
my
grief
alas
i
leave
my
friend
behind
me
thou
who
didst
find
thy
eurydice
and
lose
her
again
as
soon
as
found
when
she
had
vanished
like
a
dream
how
didst
thou
hate
the
cheerful
light
i
must
away
but
i
will
not
fear
the
gods
look
down
upon
us
ye
who
slay
me
unoffending
when
i
am
no
more
your
time
of
trembling
shall
come
ye
nereids
receive
your
guest
who
throws
himself
upon
your
mercy
so
saying
he
sprang
into
the
deep
sea
the
waves
covered
him
and
the
seamen
held
on
their
way
fancying
themselves
safe
from
all
danger
of
detection
but
the
strains
of
his
music
had
drawn
round
him
the
inhabitants
of
the
deep
to
listen
and
dolphins
followed
the
ship
as
if
chained
by
a
spell
while
he
struggled
in
the
waves
a
dolphin
offered
him
his
back
and
carried
him
mounted
thereon
safe
to
shore
at
the
spot
where
he
landed
a
monument
of
brass
was
afterwards
erected
upon
the
rocky
shore
to
preserve
the
memory
of
the
event
when
arion
and
the
dolphin
parted
each
to
his
own
element
arion
thus
poured
forth
his
thanks
farewell
thou
faithful
friendly
fish
would
that
i
could
reward
thee
but
thou
canst
not
wend
with
me
nor
i
with
thee
companionship
we
may
not
have
may
galatea
queen
of
the
deep
accord
thee
her
favor
and
thou
proud
of
the
burden
draw
her
chariot
over
the
smooth
mirror
of
the
deep
arion
hastened
from
the
shore
and
soon
saw
before
him
the
towers
of
corinth
he
journeyed
on
harp
in
hand
singing
as
he
went
full
of
love
and
happiness
forgetting
his
losses
and
mindful
only
of
what
remained
his
friend
and
his
lyre
he
entered
the
hospitable
halls
and
was
soon
clasped
in
the
embrace
of
periander
i
come
back
to
thee
my
friend
he
said
the
talent
which
a
god
bestowed
has
been
the
delight
of
thousands
but
false
knaves
have
stripped
me
of
my
treasure
yet
i
retain
the
consciousness
of
wide
spread
fame
then
he
told
periander
all
the
wonderful
events
that
had
befallen
him
who
heard
him
with
amazement
shall
such
wickedness
triumph
said
he
then
in
vain
is
power
lodged
in
my
hands
that
we
may
discover
the
criminals
you
must
remain
here
in
concealment
and
so
they
will
approach
without
suspicion
when
the
ship
arrived
in
the
harbor
he
summoned
the
mariners

i
anxiously

for
his
return
they
replied
we
left
him
well
and
prosperous
in
tarentum
as
they
said
these
words
arion
stepped
forth
and
faced
them
his
proportioned
limbs
were
arrayed
in
gold
and
purple
fair
to
see
his
tunic
fell
around
him
in
graceful
folds
jewels
adorned
his
arms
his
brow
was
crowned
with
a
golden
wreath
and
over
his
neck
and
shoulders
flowed
his
hair
perfumed
with
odors
his
left
hand
held
the
lyre
his
right
the
ivory
wand
with
which
he
struck
its
chords
they
fell
prostrate
at
his
feet
as
if
a
lightning
bolt
had
struck
them
we
meant
to
murder
him
and
he
has
become
a
god
o

not

some
barbarous

spenser
represents
arion
mounted
on
his
dolphin
accompanying
the
train
of
neptune
and
amphitrite
then
was
there
heard
a
most
celestial
sound
of
dainty
music
which
did
next
ensue
and
on
the
floating
waters
as
enthroned
arion
with
his
harp
unto
him
drew
the
ears
and
hearts
of
all
that
goodly
crew
even
when
as
yet
the
dolphin
which
him
bore
through
the
aegean
seas
from
pirates
view
stood
still
by
him
astonished
at
his
lore
and
all
the
raging
seas
for
joy
forgot
to
roar
byron
in
his
childe
harold
canto
alludes
to
the
story
of
arion
when
describing
his
voyage
he
represents
one
of
the
seamen
making
music
to
entertain
the
rest
the
moon
is
up
by
heaven
a
lovely
eve
long
streams
of
light
dancing
waves
expand
now
lads
on
shore
may
sigh
and
maids
believe
such
be
our
fate
when
we
return
to
land
meantime
some
rude
arion
restless
hand
wakes
the
brisk
harmony
that
sailors
love
a
circle
there
of
merry
listeners
stand
or
to
some
measure
featly
move
thoughtless
as
if
on
shore
they
still
were
free
to
rove
ibycus
in
order
to
understand
the
story
of
ibycus
which
follows
it
is
necessary
to
remember
first
that
the
theatres
of
the
ancients
were
immense
fabrics
capable
of
containing
from
ten
to
thirty
thousand
spectators
and
as
they
were
used
only
on
festival
occasions
and
admission
was
free
to
all
they
were
usually
filled
they
were
without
roofs
and
open
to
the
sky
and
the
performances
were
in
the
daytime
secondly
the
appalling
representation
of
the
furies
is
not
exaggerated
in
the
story
it
is
recorded
that
aeschylus
the
tragic
poet
having
on
one
occasion
represented
the
furies
in
a
chorus
of
fifty
performers
the
terror
of
the
spectators
was
such
that
many
fainted
and
were
thrown
into
convulsions
and
the
magistrates
forbade
a
like
representation
for
the
future
ibycus
the
pious
poet
was
on
his
way
to
the
chariot
races
and
musical
competitions
held
at
the
isthmus
of
corinth
which
attracted
all
of
grecian
lineage
apollo
had
bestowed
on
him
the
gift
of
song
the
honeyed
lips
of
the
poet
and
he
pursued
his
way
with
lightsome
step
full
of
the
god
already
the
towers
of
corinth
crowning
the
height
appeared
in
view
and
he
had
entered
with
pious
awe
the
sacred
grove
of
neptune
no
living
object
was
in
sight
only
a
flock
of
cranes
flew
overhead
taking
the
same
course
as
himself
in
their
migration
to
a
southern
clime
good
luck
to
you
ye
friendly
squadrons
he
exclaimed
my
companions
from
across
the
sea
i
take
your
company
for
a
good
omen
we
come
from
far
and
fly
in
search
of
hospitality
may
both
of
us
meet
that
kind
reception
which
shields
the
stranger
guest
from
harm
he
paced
briskly
on
and
soon
was
in
the
middle
of
the
wood
there
suddenly
at
a
narrow
pass
two
robbers
stepped
forth
and
barred
his
way
he
must
yield
or
fight
but
his
hand
accustomed
to
the
lyre
and
not
to
the
strife
of
arms
sank
powerless
he
called
for
help
on
men
and
gods
but
his
cry
reached
no
defender
ear
then
here
must
i
die
said
he
in
a
strange
land
unlamented
cut
off
by
the
hand
of
outlaws
and
see
none
to
avenge
my
cause
sore
wounded
he
sank
to
the
earth
when
hoarse
screamed
the
cranes
overhead
take
up
my
cause
ye
cranes
he
said
since
no
voice
but
yours
answers
to
my
cry
so
saying
he
closed
his
eyes
in
death
the
body
despoiled
and
mangled
was
found
and
though
disfigured
with
wounds
was
recognized
by
the
friend
in
corinth
who
had
expected
him
as
a
guest
is
it
thus
i
find
you
restored
to
me
he
exclaimed
i
who
hoped
to
entwine
your
temples
with
the
wreath
of
triumph
in
the
strife
of
song
the
guests
assembled
at
the
festival
heard
the
tidings
with
dismay
all
greece
felt
the
wound
every
heart
owned
its
loss
they
crowded
round
the
tribunal
of
the
magistrates
and
demanded
vengeance
on
the
murderers
and
expiation
with
their
blood
but
what
trace
or
mark
shall
point
out
the
perpetrator
from
amidst
the
vast
multitude
attracted
by
the
splendor
of
the
feast
did
he
fall
by
the
hands
of
robbers
or
did
some
private
enemy
slay
him
the
sun
alone
can
tell
for
no
other
eye
beheld
it
yet
not
improbably
the
murderer
even
now
walks
in
the
midst
of
the
throng
and
enjoys
the
fruits
of
his
crime
while
vengeance
seeks
for
him
in
vain
perhaps
in
their
own
temple
enclosure
he
defies
the
gods
mingling
freely
in
this
throng
of
men
that
now
presses
into
the
amphitheatre
for
now
crowded
together
row
on
row
the
multitude
fill
the
seats
till
it
seems
as
if
the
very
fabric
would
give
way
the
murmur
of
voices
sounds
like
the
roar
of
the
sea
while
the
circles
widening
in
their
ascent
rise
tier
on
tier
as
if
they
would
reach
the
sky
and
now
the
vast
assemblage
listens
to
the
awful
voice
of
the
chorus
personating
the
furies
which
in
solemn
guise
advances
with
measured
step
and
moves
around
the
circuit
of
the
theatre
can
they
be
mortal
women
who
compose
that
awful
group
and
can
that
vast
concourse
of
silent
forms
be
living
beings
the
choristers
clad
in
black
bore
in
their
fleshless
hands
torches
blazing
with
a
pitchy
flame
their
cheeks
were
bloodless
and
in
place
of
hair
writhing
and
swelling
serpents
curled
around
their
brows
forming
a
circle
these
awful
beings
sang
their
hymns
rending
the
hearts
of
the
guilty
and
enchaining
all
their
faculties
it
rose
and
swelled
overpowering
the
sound
of
the
instruments
stealing
the
judgment
palsying
the
heart
curdling
the
blood
happy
the
man
who
keeps
his
heart
pure
from
guilt
and
crime
him
we
avengers
touch
not
he
treads
the
path
of
life
secure
from
us
but
woe
woe
to
him
who
has
done
the
deed
of
secret
murder
we
the
fearful
family
of
night
fasten
ourselves
upon
his
whole
being
thinks
he
by
flight
to
escape
us
we
fly
still
faster
in
pursuit
twine
our
snakes
around
his
feet
and
bring
him
to
the
ground
unwearied
we
pursue
no
pity
checks
our
course
still
on
and
on
to
the
end
of
life
we
give
him
no
peace
nor
rest
thus
the
eumenides
sang
and
moved
in
solemn
cadence
while
stillness
like
the
stillness
of
death
sat
over
the
whole
assembly
as
if
in
the
presence
of
superhuman
beings
and
then
in
solemn
march
completing
the
circuit
of
the
theatre
they
passed
out
at
the
back
of
the
stage
every
heart
fluttered
between
illusion
and
reality
and
every
breast
panted
with
undefined
terror
quailing
before
the
awful
power
that
watches
secret
crimes
and
winds
unseen
the
skein
of
destiny
at
that
moment
a
cry
burst
forth
from
one
of
the
uppermost
benches
look
look
comrade
yonder
are
the
cranes
of
ibycus
and
suddenly
there
appeared
sailing
across
the
sky
a
dark
object
which
a
moment
inspection
showed
to
be
a
flock
of
cranes
flying
directly
over
the
theatre
of
ibycus
did
he
say
the
beloved
name
revived
the
sorrow
in
every
breast
as
wave
follows
wave
over
the
face
of
the
sea
so
ran
from
mouth
to
mouth
the
words
of
ibycus
him
whom
we
all
lament
whom
some
hand
laid
low
what
have
the
cranes
to
do
with
him
and
louder
grew
the
swell
of
voices
while
like
a
lightning
flash
the
thought
sped
through
every
heart
observe
the
power
of
the
eumenides
the
pious
poet
shall
be
avenged
the
murderer
has
informed
against
himself
seize
the
man
who
uttered
that
cry
and
the
other
to
whom
he
spoke
the
culprit
would
gladly
have
recalled
his
words
but
it
was
too
late
the
faces
of
the
murderers
pale
with
terror
betrayed
their
guilt
the
people
took
them
before
the
judge
they
confessed
their
crime
and
suffered
the
punishment
they
deserved
simonides
simonides
was
one
of
the
most
prolific
of
the
early
poets
of
greece
but
only
a
few
fragments
of
his
compositions
have
descended
to
us
he
wrote
hymns
triumphal
odes
and
elegies
in
the
last
species
of
composition
he
particularly
excelled
his
genius
was
inclined
to
the
pathetic
and
none
could
touch
with
truer
effect
the
chords
of
human
sympathy
the
lamentation
of
danae
the
most
important
of
the
fragments
which
remain
of
his
poetry
is
based
upon
the
tradition
that
danae
and
her
infant
son
were
confined
by
order
of
her
father
acrisius
in
a
chest
and
set
adrift
on
the
sea
the
chest
floated
towards
the
island
of
seriphus
where
both
were
rescued
by
dictys
a
fisherman
and
carried
to
polydectes
king
of
the
country
who
received
and
protected
them
the
child
perseus
when
grown
up
became
a
famous
hero
whose
adventures
have
been
recorded
in
a
previous
chapter
simonides
passed
much
of
his
life
at
the
courts
of
princes
and
often
employed
his
talents
in
panegyric
and
festal
odes
receiving
his
reward
from
the
munificence
of
those
whose
exploits
he
celebrated
this
employment
was
not
derogatory
but
closely
resembles
that
of
the
earliest
bards
such
as
demodocus
described
by
homer
or
of
homer
himself
as
recorded
by
tradition
on
one
occasion
when
residing
at
the
court
of
scopas
king
of
thessaly
the
prince
desired
him
to
prepare
a
poem
in
celebration
of
his
exploits
to
be
recited
at
a
banquet
in
order
to
diversify
his
theme
simonides
who
was
celebrated
for
his
piety
introduced
into
his
poem
the
exploits
of
castor
and
pollux
such
digressions
were
not
unusual
with
the
poets
on
similar
occasions
and
one
might
suppose
an
ordinary
mortal
might
have
been
content
to
share
the
praises
of
the
sons
of
leda
but
vanity
is
exacting
and
as
scopas
sat
at
his
festal
board
among
his
courtiers
and
sycophants
he
grudged
every
verse
that
did
not
rehearse
his
own
praises
when
simonides
approached
to
receive
the
promised
reward
scopas
bestowed
but
half
the
expected
sum
saying
here
is
payment
for
my
portion
of
thy
performance
castor
and
pollux
will
doubtless
compensate
thee
for
so
much
as
relates
to
them
the
disconcerted
poet
returned
to
his
seat
amidst
the
laughter
which
followed
the
great
man
jest
in
a
little
time
he
received
a
message
that
two
young
men
on
horseback
were
waiting
without
and
anxious
to
see
him
simonides
hastened
to
the
door
but
looked
in
vain
for
the
visitors
scarcely
however
had
he
left
the
banqueting
hall
when
the
roof
fell
in
with
a
loud
crash
burying
scopas
and
all
his
guests
beneath
the
ruins
on
inquiring
as
to
the
appearance
of
the
young
men
who
had
sent
for
him
simonides
was
satisfied
that
they
were
no
other
than
castor
and
pollux
themselves
sappho
sappho
was
a
poetess
who
flourished
in
a
very
early
age
of
greek
literature
of
her
works
few
fragments
remain
but
they
are
enough
to
establish
her
claim
to
eminent
poetical
genius
the
story
of
sappho
commonly
alluded
to
is
that
she
was
passionately
in
love
with
a
beautiful
youth
named
phaon
and
failing
to
obtain
a
return
of
affection
she
threw
herself
from
the
promontory
of
leucadia
into
the
sea
under
a
superstition
that
those
who
should
take
that
would
if
not
destroyed
be
cured
of
their
love
byron

the
story
of
sappho

warmed
by

beauty
and
she
came
down
to

by

life
for
she

and
guarded
his

and

from

the
story
of
endymion
has
a
peculiar
charm
from
the
human
meaning
which
it
so
thinly
veils
we
see
in
endymion
the
young
poet
his
fancy
and
his
heart
seeking
in
vain
for
that
which
can
satisfy
them
finding
his
favorite

moonlight
and
nursing
there
beneath
the
beams
of
the
bright
and
silent
witness
the
melancholy
and
the
ardor
which
consumes

they
prayed

a
poem
on

of

the

lines
are

in

he
alludes
to

mythic
story
we
must
premise
that
on

orion
is
represented
as
robed
in
a
lion
skin

wielding
a
club
at
the
moment
the

of
the
constellation
one
by
one
were
quenched
in
the
light
of
the
moon

poet
tells
us
down
fell
the
red
skin
of
the
lion
into
the
river
at
his
feet
his
mighty
club
no
longer
beat
the
forehead
of

bull
but
he
reeled
as
of
yore
beside
the
sea
when
blinded
by
oenopion
he
sought
the
blacksmith
at
his
forge
and
climbing
up
the
narrow
gorge
fixed
his
blank
eyes
upon

after

great
mortification

left

of

there
still
exist
some
memorials
of

on

nile
in

are
two
colossal
statues
one
of
which
is
said
to
be
the
statue
of

ancient
writers
record
that
when
the
first
rays
of

rising
sun
fall
upon
this
statue
a
sound
is
heard
to
issue
from
it
which
they
compare
to
the
snapping
of
a
there
is
some
doubt
about
the
identification
of
the
existing
statue
with
the
one
described
by
the
ancients
and
the
mysterious
sounds
are
still
more
doubtful
yet
there
are
not
wanting
some
modern
testimonies
to
their
being
still
audible
it
has
been
suggested
that
sounds
produced
by
confined
air
making
its
escape
from
crevices
or
caverns
in

may
have
given
some
ground
for
the
story
sir
gardner
wilkinson
a
late
traveller
of
the
highest
authority
examined
the
statue
itself
and
discovered
that
it
was
hollow
and
that
in
the
lap
of
the
statue
is
a
stone
which
on
being
struck
emits
a
metallic
sound
that
might
still
be
made

deceive

predisposed

acis

scylla
was
a
fair
virgin
of
sicily
a
favorite
of
the
she
had
many
suitors
but
repelled
them
all
and
would
go
to
the
grotto
of
galatea
and
tell
her
how
she
was
persecuted
one
day
the
goddess
while
scylla
dressed
her
hair
listened
to
the
story
and
then
replied
yet
maiden
your
persecutors
are
of
the
not
ungentle
race
of
men
whom
if
you
will
you
can
repel
but
i
the
daughter
of
nereus
and
protected
by
such
a
band
of
sisters
found
no
escape
from
the
passion
of
the
cyclops
but
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
tears
stopped
her
utterance
which
when
the
pitying
maiden
had
wiped
away
with
her
delicate
finger
and
soothed
the
goddess
tell
me
dearest
said
she
the
cause
of
your
grief
galatea
then
said
acis
was
the
son
of
faunus
and
a
naiad
his
father
and
mother
loved
him
dearly
but
their
love
was
not
equal
to
mine
for
the
beautiful
youth
attached
himself
to
me
alone
and
he
was
just
sixteen
years
old
the
down
just
beginning
to
darken
his
cheeks
as
much
as
i
sought
his
society
so
much
did
the
cyclops
seek
mine
and
if
you
ask
me
whether
my
love
for
acis
or
my
hatred
of
polyphemus
was
the
stronger
i
can
not
tell
you
they
were
in
equal
measure
o
venus
how
great
is
thy
power
this
fierce
giant
the
terror
of
the
woods
whom
no
hapless
stranger
escaped
unharmed
who
defied
even
jove
himself
learned
to
feel
what
love
was
and
touched
with
a
passion
for
me
forgot
his
flocks
and
his
caverns
then
for
the
first
time
he
began
to
take
some
care
of
his
appearance
and
to
try
to
make
himself
agreeable
he
harrowed
those
coarse
locks
of
his
with
a
comb
and
mowed
his
beard
with
a
sickle
looked
at
his
harsh
features
in
the
water
and
composed
his
countenance
his
love
of
slaughter
his
fierceness
and
thirst
of
blood
prevailed
no
more
and
ships
that
touched
at
his
island
went
away
in
safety
he
paced
up
and
down
the
imprinting
huge
tracks
with
his
heavy
tread
and
when
weary
lay
tranquilly
in
his
cave
there
is
a
cliff
which
projects
into
the
sea
which
washes
it
on
either
side
thither
one
day
the
huge
cyclops
ascended
and
sat
down
while
his
flocks
spread
themselves
around
laying
down
his
staff
which
would
have
served
for
a
mast
to
hold
a
vessel
sail
and
taking
his
instrument
compacted
of
numerous
pipes
he
made
the
hills
and
the
waters
echo
the
music
of
his
song
i
lay
hid
under
a
rock
by
the
side
of
my
beloved
acis
and
listened
to
the
distant
strain
it
was
full
of
extravagant
praises
of
my
beauty
mingled
with
passionate
reproaches
of
my
coldness
and
cruelty
when
he
had
finished
he
rose
up
and
like
a
raging
bull
that
can
not
stand
still
wandered
off
into
the
woods
acis
and
i
thought
no
more
of
him
till
on
a
sudden
he
came
to
a
spot
which
gave
him
a
view
of
us
as
we
sat
see
you
he
exclaimed
i
will
make
this
the
last
of
your
his
voice
was
a
roar
such
as
an
angry
cyclops
alone
could
utter
aetna
trembled
at
the
sound
i
overcome
with
terror
plunged
into
the
water
acis
turned
and
fled
crying
me
galatea
save
me
my
parents
the
cyclops
pursued
him
and
tearing
a
rock
from
the
side
of
the
mountain
hurled
it
at
him
though
only
a
corner
of
it
touched
him
it
overwhelmed
him
all
that
fate
left
in
my
power
i
did
for
acis
i
endowed
him
with
the
honors
of
his
grandfather
the
the
purple
blood
flowed
out
from
under
the
rock
but
by
degrees
grew
paler
and
looked
like
the
stream
of
a
river
rendered
turbid
by
rains
and
in
time
it
became
clear
the
rock
cleaved
open
and
the
water
as
it
gushed
from
the
chasm
uttered
a
pleasing
murmur
thus
acis
was
changed
into
a
river
and
the
river
retains
the
name
of
acis
dryden
in
his
cymon
and
iphigenia
has
told
the
story
of
a
clown
converted
into
a
gentleman
by
the
power
of
love
in
a
way
that
shows
traces
of
kindred
to
the
old
story
of
galatea
and
the
cyclops
what
not
his
father
care
nor
tutor
art
could
plant
with
pains
in
his
unpolished
heart
the
best
instructor
love
at
once
inspired
as
barren
grounds
to
fruitfulness
are
fired
love
taught
him
shame
and
shame
with
love
at

soon
taught
the

civilities
of
life

the

minerva
was
the
goddess
of
wisdom
but
on
one
occasion
she
did
a
very
foolish
thing
she
entered
into
competition
with
juno
and
venus
for
the
prize
of
beauty
it
happened
thus
at
the
nuptials
of
peleus
and
thetis
all
the
gods
were
invited
with
the
exception
of
eris
or
discord
enraged
at
her
exclusion
the
goddess
threw
a
golden
apple
among
the
guests
with
the
inscription
for
the
fairest
thereupon
juno
venus
and
minerva
each
claimed
the
apple
jupiter
not
willing
to
decide
in
so
delicate
a
matter
sent
the
goddesses
to
mount
ida
where
the
beautiful
shepherd
paris
was
tending
his
flocks
and
to
him
was
committed
the
decision
the
goddesses
accordingly
appeared
before
him
juno
promised
him
power
and
riches
minerva
glory
and
renown
in

the
fairest
of

for
his

attempting
to
bias
his
decision
in
her
own
favor
paris
decided
in
favor
of

and
gave
her
the
golden
apple
thus
making
the
two
other

his
enemies

the
protection
of

sailed
to
greece
and
was
hospitably
received
by
menelaus
king
of

the

was
the
very
woman
whom
venus
had
destined
for

the
fairest
of
her
sex
she
had
been
sought
as
a
bride
by
numerous
suitors
and
before
her
decision
was
made
known
they
all
at
the
suggestion
of
ulysses
one
of
their
number
took
an
oath
that
they
would
defend
her
from
all
injury
and
avenge
her
cause
if
necessary
she
chose
menelaus
and
was
living
with
him
happily
when
paris
became
their
guest
paris
aided
by
venus
persuaded
her
to
elope
with
him
and
carried
her
to
troy

arose
the
famous

theme
of
the
greatest
poems
of

called
upon

him
in
his
efforts
to
recover
his
wife
they
generally
came
forward
but
ulysses
who
had
married
penelope
and
was
very
happy
in
his
wife
and
child
had
no
disposition
to
embark
in
such
a
troublesome
affair
he
therefore
hung
back
and
palamedes
was
sent
to
urge
him
when
palamedes
arrived
at

ulysses
pretended
to
be
mad

yoked
an

an

the
infant

before

whereupon
the
father
turned
the
plough
aside
showing
plainly
that
he
was
no
madman
and
after
that
could
no
longer
refuse
to
fulfil
his
promise

now
himself
gained
for
the
undertaking
he
lent
his
aid
to

sent
him
away
to

of
intellect
diomede
second
only
to
achilles
in
all
the
qualities
of
a
hero
ulysses
famous
for
his
sagacity
and
nestor
the
oldest
of
the
grecian
chiefs
and
one
to
whom
they
all
looked
up
for
counsel
but
troy
was
no
feeble
enemy
priam
the
king
was
now
old
but
he
had
been
a
wise
prince
and
had
strengthened
his
state
by
good
government
at
home
and
numerous
alliances
with
his
neighbors
but
the
principal
stay
and
support
of
his
throne
was
his
son
hector
one
of
the
noblest
characters
painted
by
heathen
antiquity
he
felt
from
the
first
a
presentiment
of
the
fall
of
his
country
but
still
persevered
in
his
heroic
resistance
yet
by
no
means
justified
the
wrong
which
brought
this
danger
upon
her
he
was
united
in
marriage
with
andromache
and
as
a
husband
and
father
his
character
was
not
less
admirable
than
as
a
warrior
the
principal
leaders
on
the
side
of
the
trojans
besides
hector
were
aeneas
and
deiphobus
glaucus
and
sarpedon
after
two
years
of
preparation
the
greek
fleet
and
army
assembled
in
the
port
of
aulis
in
boeotia
here
agamemnon
in
hunting
killed
a
stag
which
was
sacred
to
diana
and
the
goddess
in
return
visited
the
army
with
pestilence
and
produced
a
calm
which
prevented
the
ships
from
leaving
the
port
calchas
the
soothsayer
thereupon
announced
that
the
wrath
of
the
virgin
goddess
could
only
be
appeased
by
the
sacrifice
of
a
virgin
on
her
altar
and
that
none
other
but
the
daughter
of
the
offender
would
be
acceptable
agamemnon
however
reluctant
yielded
his
consent
and
the
maiden
iphigenia
was
sent
for
under
the
pretence
that
she
was
to
be
married
to
achilles
when
she
was
about
to
be
sacrificed
the
goddess
relented
and
snatched
her
away
leaving
a
hind
in
her
place
and
iphigenia
enveloped
in
a
cloud
was
carried
to
tauris
where
diana
made
her
priestess
of
her
temple
tennyson
in
his
dream
of
fair
women
makes
iphigenia
thus
describe
her
feelings
at
the
moment
of
sacrifice
i
was
cut
off
from
hope
in
that
sad
place
which
yet
to
name
my
spirit
loathes
and
fears
my
father
held
his
hand
upon
his
face
i
blinded
by
my
tears
still
strove
to
speak
my
voice
was
thick
with
sighs
as
in
a
dream
dimly
i
could
descry
the
stern
kings
with
wolfish
eyes
waiting
to
see
me
die
the
tall
masts
quivered
as
they
lay
afloat
the
temples
and
the
people
and
the
shore
one
drew
a
sharp
knife
through
my
tender
throat
slowly
and
nothing
more
the
wind
now
proving
fair
the
fleet
made
sail
and
brought
the
forces
to
the
coast
of
troy
the
trojans
came
to
oppose
their
landing
and
at
the
first
onset
protesilaus
fell
by
the
hand
of
hector
protesilaus
had
left
at
home
his
wife
laodamia
who
was
most
tenderly
attached
to
him
when
the
news
of
his
death
reached
her
she
implored
the
gods
to
be
allowed
to
converse
with
him
only
three
hours
the
request
was
granted
mercury
led
protesilaus
back
to
the
upper
world
and
when
he
died
a
second
time
laodamia
died
with
him
there
was
a
story
that
the
nymphs
planted
elm
trees
round
his
grave
which
grew
very
well
till
they
were
high
enough
to
command
a
view
of
troy
and
then
withered
away
while
fresh
branches
sprang
from
the
roots
wordsworth
has
taken
the
story
of
protesilaus
and
laodamia
for
the
subject
of
a
poem
it
seems
the
oracle
had
declared
that
victory
should
be
the
lot
of
that
party
from
which
should
fall
the
first
victim
to
the
war
the
poet
represents
protesilaus
on
his
brief
return
to
earth
as
relating
to
laodamia
the
story
of
his
fate
wind
was
given
i
then
revolved
the
oracle
upon
the
silent
sea
and
if
no
worthier
led
the
way
resolved
that
of
a
thousand
vessels
mine
should
be
the
foremost
prow
impressing
to
the
strand
mine
the
first
blood
that
tinged
the
trojan
sand
bitter
ofttimes
bitter
was
the
pang
when
of
thy
loss
i
thought
beloved
wife
on
thee
too
fondly
did
my
memory
hang
and
on
the
joys
we
shared
in
mortal
life
the
paths
which
we
had
trod
these
fountains
flowers
my
new
planned
cities
and
unfinished
towers
should
suspense
permit
the
foe
to
cry
behold
they
tremble
haughty
their
array
yet
of
their
number
no
one
dares
to
die
in
soul
i
swept
the
indignity
away
old
frailties
then
recurred
but
lofty
thought
in
act
embodied
my
deliverance
wrought
upon
the
side
of
hellespont
such
faith
was
entertained
a
knot
of
spiry
trees
for
ages
grew
from
out
the
tomb
of
him
for
whom
she
died
and
ever
when
such
stature
they
had
gained
that
ilium
walls
were
subject
to
their
view
the
trees
tall
summits
withered
at
the
sight
a
constant
interchange
of
growth
and
blight
the
iliad
the
war
continued
without
decisive
results
for
nine
years
then
an
event
occurred
which
seemed
likely
to
be
fatal
to
the
cause
of
the
greeks
and
that
was
a
quarrel
between
achilles
and
agamemnon
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
great
poem
of
homer
the
iliad
begins
the
greeks
though
unsuccessful
against
troy
had
taken
the
neighboring
and
allied
cities
and
in
the
division
of
the
spoil
a
female
captive
by
name
chryseis
daughter
of
chryses
priest
of
apollo
had
fallen
to
the
share
of
agamemnon
chryses
came
bearing
the
sacred
emblems
of
his
office
and
begged
the
release
of
his
daughter
agamemnon
refused
thereupon
chryses
implored
apollo
to
afflict
the
greeks
till
they
should
be
forced
to
yield
their
prey
apollo
granted
the
prayer
of
his
priest
and
sent
pestilence
into
the
grecian
camp
then
a
council
was
called
to
deliberate
how
to
allay
the
wrath
of
the
gods
and
avert
the
plague
achilles
boldly
charged
their
misfortunes
upon
agamemnon
as
caused
by
his
withholding
chryseis
agamemnon
enraged
consented
to
relinquish
his
captive
but
demanded
that
achilles
should
yield
to
him
in
her
stead
briseis
a
maiden
who
had
fallen
to
achilles
share
in
the
division
of
the
spoil
achilles
submitted
but
forthwith
declared
that
he
would
take
no
further
part
in
the
war
he
withdrew
his
forces
from
the
general
camp
and
openly
avowed
his
intention
of
returning
home
to
greece
the
gods
and
goddesses
interested
themselves
as
much
in
this
famous
war
as
the
parties
themselves
it
was
well
known
to
them
that
fate
had
decreed
that
troy
should
fall
at
last
if
her
enemies
should
persevere
and
not
voluntarily
abandon
the
enterprise
yet
there
was
room
enough
left
for
chance
to
excite
by
turns
the
hopes
and
fears
of
the
powers
above
who
took
part
with
either
side
juno
and
minerva
in
consequence
of
the
slight
put
upon
their
charms
by
paris
were
hostile
to
the
trojans
venus
for
the
opposite
cause
favored
them
venus
enlisted
her
admirer
mars
on
the
same
side
but
neptune
favored
the
greeks
apollo
was
neutral
sometimes
taking
one
side
sometimes
the
other
and
jove
himself
though
he
loved
the
good
king
priam
yet
exercised
a
degree
of
impartiality
not
however
without
exceptions
thetis
the
mother
of
achilles
warmly
resented
the
injury
done
to
her
son
she
repaired
immediately
to
jove
palace
and
besought
him
to
make
the
greeks
repent
of
their
injustice
to
achilles
by
granting
success
to
the
trojan
arms
jupiter
consented
and
in
the
battle
which
ensued
the
trojans
were
completely
successful
the
greeks
were
driven
from
the
field
and
took
refuge
in
their
ships
then
agamemnon
called
a
council
of
his
wisest
and
bravest
chiefs
nestor
advised
that
an
embassy
should
be
sent
to
achilles
to
persuade
him
to
return
to
the
field
that
agamemnon
should
yield
the
maiden
the
cause
of
the
dispute
with
ample
gifts
to
atone
for
the
wrong
he
had
done
agamemnon
consented
and
ulysses
ajax
and
phoenix
were
sent
to
carry
to
achilles
the
penitent
message
they
performed
that
duty
but
achilles
was
deaf
to
their
entreaties
he
positively
refused
to
return
to
the
field
and
persisted
in
his
resolution
to
embark
for
greece
without
delay
the
greeks
had
constructed
a
rampart
around
their
ships
and
now
instead
of
besieging
troy
they
were
in
a
manner
besieged
themselves
within
their
rampart
the
next
day
after
the
unsuccessful
embassy
to
achilles
a
battle
was
fought
and
the
trojans
favored
by
jove
were
successful
and
succeeded
in
forcing
a
passage
through
the
grecian
rampart
and
were
about
to
set
fire
to
the
ships
neptune
seeing
the
greeks
so
pressed
came
to
their
rescue
he
appeared
in
the
form
of
calchas
the
prophet
encouraged
the
warriors
with
his
shouts
and
appealed
to
each
individually
till
he
raised
their
ardor
to
such
a
pitch
that
they
forced
the
trojans
to
give
way
ajax
performed
prodigies
of
valor
and
at
length
encountered
hector
ajax
shouted
defiance
to
which
hector
replied
and
hurled
his
lance
at
the
huge
warrior
it
was
well
aimed
and
struck
ajax
where
the
belts
that
bore
his
sword
and
shield
crossed
each
other
on
the
breast
the
double
guard
prevented
its
penetrating
and
it
fell
harmless
then
ajax
seizing
a
huge
stone
one
of
those
that
served
to
prop
the
ships
hurled
it
at
hector
it
struck
him
in
the
neck
and
stretched
him
on
the
plain
his
followers
instantly
seized
him
and
bore
him
off
stunned
and
wounded
while
neptune
was
thus
aiding
the
greeks
and
driving
back
the
trojans
jupiter
saw
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
for
his
attention
had
been
drawn
from
the
field
by
the
wiles
of
juno
that
goddess
had
arrayed
herself
in
all
her
charms
and
to
crown
all
had
borrowed
of
venus
her
girdle
called
cestus
which
had
the
effect
to
heighten
the
wearer
charms
to
such
a
degree
that
they
were
quite
irresistible
so
prepared
juno
went
to
join
her
husband
who
sat
on
olympus
watching
the
battle
when
he
beheld
her
she
looked
so
charming
that
the
fondness
of
his
early
love
revived
and
forgetting
the
contending
armies
and
all
other
affairs
of
state
he
thought
only
of
her
and
let
the
battle
go
as
it
would
but
this
absorption
did
not
continue
long
and
when
upon
turning
his
eyes
downward
he
beheld
hector
stretched
on
the
plain
almost
lifeless
from
pain
and
bruises
he
dismissed
juno
in
a
rage
commanding
her
to
send
iris
and
apollo
to
him
when
iris
came
he
sent
her
with
a
stern
message
to
neptune
ordering
him
instantly
to
quit
the
field
apollo
was
despatched
to
heal
hector
bruises
and
to
inspirit
his
heart
these
orders
were
obeyed
with
such
speed
that
while
the
battle
still
raged
hector
returned
to
the
field
and
neptune
betook
himself
to
his
own
dominions
an
arrow
from
paris
bow
wounded
machaon
son
of
aesculapius
who
inherited
his
father
art
of
healing
and
was
therefore
of
great
value
to
the
greeks
as
their
surgeon
besides
being
one
of
their
bravest
warriors
nestor
took
machaon
in
his
chariot
and
conveyed
him
from
the
field
as
they
passed
the
ships
of
achilles
that
hero
looking
out
over
the
field
saw
the
chariot
of
nestor
and
recognized
the
old
chief
but
could
not
discern
who
the
wounded
chief
was
so
calling
patroclus
his
companion
and
dearest
friend
he
sent
him
to
nestor
tent
to
inquire
patroclus
arriving
at
nestor
tent
saw
machaon
wounded
and
having
told
the
cause
of
his
coming
would
have
hastened
away
but
nestor
detained
him
to
tell
him
the
extent
of
the
grecian
calamities
he
reminded
him
also
how
at
the
time
of
departing
for
troy
achilles
and
himself
had
been
charged
by
their
respective
fathers
with
different
advice
achilles
to
aspire
to
the
highest
pitch
of
glory
patroclus
as
the
elder
to
keep
watch
over
his
friend
and
to
guide
his
inexperience
now
said
nestor
is
the
time
for
such
influence
if
the
gods
so
please
thou
mayest
win
him
back
to
the
common
cause
but
if
not
let
him
at
least
send
his
soldiers
to
the
field
and
come
thou
patroclus
clad
in
his
armor
and
perhaps
the
very
sight
of
it
may
drive
back
the
trojans
patroclus
was
strongly
moved
with
this
address
and
hastened
back
to
achilles
revolving
in
his
mind
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
he
told
the
prince
the
sad
condition
of
affairs
at
the
camp
of
their
late
associates
diomede
ulysses
agamemnon
machaon
all
wounded
the
rampart
broken
down
the
enemy
among
the
ships
preparing
to
burn
them
and
thus
to
cut
off
all
means
of
return
to
greece
while
they
spoke
the
flames
burst
forth
from
one
of
the
ships
achilles
at
the
sight
relented
so
far
as
to
grant
patroclus
his
request
to
lead
the
myrmidons
for
so
were
soldiers
called
to
the
field
and
to
lend
him
his
armor
that
he
might
thereby
strike
more
terror
into
the
minds
of
the
trojans
without
delay
the
soldiers
were
marshalled
patroclus
put
on
the
radiant
armor
and
mounted
the
chariot
of
achilles
and
led
forth
the
men
ardent
for
battle
but
before
he
went
achilles
strictly
charged
him
that
he
should
be
content
with
repelling
the
foe
seek
not
said
he
to
press
the
trojans
without
me
lest
thou
add
still
more
to
the
disgrace
already
mine
then
exhorting
the
troops
to
do
their
best
he
dismissed
them
full
of
ardor
to
the
fight
patroclus
and
his
myrmidons
at
once
plunged
into
the
contest
where
it
raged
hottest
at
the
sight
of
which
the
joyful
grecians
shouted
and
the
ships
reechoed
the
acclaim
the
trojans
at
the
sight
of
the
armor
struck
with
terror
looked
everywhere
for
refuge
first
those
who
had
got
possession
of
the
ship
and
set
it
on
fire
left
and
allowed
the
grecians
to
retake
it
and
extinguish
the
flames
then
the
rest
of
the
trojans
fled
in
dismay
ajax
menelaus
and
the
two
sons
of
nestor
performed
prodigies
of
valor
hector
was
forced
to
turn
his
horses
heads
and
retire
from
the
enclosure
leaving
his
men
entangled
in
the
fosse
to
escape
as
they
could
patroclus
drove
them
before
him
slaying
many
none
daring
to
make
a
stand
against
him
at
last
sarpedon
son
of
jove
ventured
to
oppose
himself
in
fight
to
patroclus
jupiter
looked
down
upon
him
and
would
have
snatched
him
from
the
fate
which
awaited
him
but
juno
hinted
that
if
he
did
so
it
would
induce
all
others
of
the
inhabitants
of
heaven
to
interpose
in
like
manner
whenever
any
of
their
offspring
were
endangered
to
which
reason
jove
yielded
sarpedon
threw
his
spear
but
missed
patroclus
but
patroclus
threw
his
with
better
success
it
pierced
sarpedon
breast
and
he
fell
and
calling
to
his
friends
to
save
his
body
from
the
foe
expired
then
a
furious
contest
arose
for
the
possession
of
the
corpse
the
greeks
succeeded
and
stripped
sarpedon
of
his
armor
but
jove
would
not
allow
the
remains
of
his
son
to
be
dishonored
and
by
his
command
apollo
snatched
from
the
midst
of
the
combatants
the
body
of
sarpedon
and
committed
it
to
the
care
of
the
twin
brothers
death
and
sleep
by
whom
it
was
transported
to
lycia
the
native
land
of
sarpedon
where
it
received
due
funeral
rites
thus
far
patroclus
had
succeeded
to
his
utmost
wish
in
repelling
the
trojans
and
relieving
his
countrymen
but
now
came
a
change
of
fortune
hector
borne
in
his
chariot
confronted
him
patroclus
threw
a
vast
stone
at
hector
which
missed
its
aim
but
smote
cebriones
the
charioteer
and
knocked
him
from
the
car
hector
leaped
from
the
chariot
to
rescue
his
friend
and
patroclus
also
descended
to
complete
his
victory
thus
the
two
heroes
met
face
to
face
at
this
decisive
moment
the
poet
as
if
reluctant
to
give
hector
the
glory
records
that
phoebus
took
part
against
patroclus
he
struck
the
helmet
from
his
head
and
the
lance
from
his
hand
at
the
same
moment
an
obscure
trojan
wounded
him
in
the
back
and
hector
pressing
forward
pierced
him
with
his
spear
he
fell
mortally
wounded
then
arose
a
tremendous
conflict
for
the
body
of
patroclus
but
his
armor
was
at
once
taken
possession
of
by
hector
who
retiring
a
short
distance
divested
himself
of
his
own
armor
and
put
on
that
of
achilles
then
returned
to
the
fight
ajax
and
menelaus
defended
the
body
and
hector
and
his
bravest
warriors
struggled
to
capture
it
the
battle
raged
with
equal
fortunes
when
jove
enveloped
the
whole
face
of
heaven
with
a
dark
cloud
the
lightning
flashed
the
thunder
roared
and
ajax
looking
round
for
some
one
whom
he
might
despatch
to
achilles
to
tell
him
of
the
death
of
his
friend
and
of
the
imminent
danger
that
his
remains
would
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
could
see
no
suitable
messenger
it
was
then
that
he
exclaimed
in
those
famous
lines
so
often
quoted
father
of
heaven
and
earth
deliver
thou
achaia
host
from
darkness
clear
the
skies
give
day
and
since
thy
sovereign
will
is
such
destruction
with
it
but
o
give
us
day
cowper
or
as
rendered
by
pope
lord
of
earth
and
air
o
king
o
father
hear
my
humble
prayer
dispel
this
cloud
the
light
of
heaven
restore
give
me
to
see
and
ajax
asks
no
more
if
greece
must
perish
we
thy
will
obey
but
let
us
perish
in
the
face
of
day
jupiter
heard
the
prayer
and
dispersed
the
clouds
then
ajax
sent
antilochus
to
achilles
with
the
intelligence
of
patroclus
death
and
of
the
conflict
raging
for
his
remains
the
greeks
at
last
succeeded
in
bearing
off
the
body
to
the
ships
closely
pursued
by
hector
and
aeneas
and
the
rest
of
the
trojans
achilles
heard
the
fate
of
his
friend
with
such
distress
that
antilochus
feared
for
a
while
that
he
would
destroy
himself
his
groans
reached
the
ears
of
his
mother
thetis
far
down
in
the
deeps
of
ocean
where
she
abode
and
she
hastened
to
him
to
inquire
the
cause
she
found
him
overwhelmed
with
that
he
had
indulged
his
resentment
so
far
and
suffered
his
friend
to
fall
a
victim
to
it
but
his
only
consolation
was
the
hope
of
revenge
he
would
fly
instantly
in
search
of
hector
but
his
mother
reminded
him
that
he
was
now
without
armor
and
promised
him
if
he
would
but
wait
till
the
morrow
she
would
procure
for
him
a
suit
of
armor
from
vulcan
more
than
equal
to
that
he
had
lost
he
consented
and
thetis
immediately
repaired
to
palace
she
found
him
busy
at
his
forge
making
tripods
for
his
own
use
so
artfully
constructed
that
they
moved
forward
of
their
own
accord
when
wanted
and
retired
again
when
dismissed
on
hearing
the
request
of
thetis
vulcan
immediately
laid
aside
his
work
and
hastened
to
comply
with
her
wishes
he
fabricated
a
splendid
suit
of
armor
for
achilles
first
a
shield
adorned
with
elaborate
devices
then
a
helmet
crested
with
gold
then
a
corselet
and
greaves
of
impenetrable
temper
all
perfectly
adapted
to
his
form
and
of
consummate
workmanship
it
was
all
done
in
one
night
and
thetis
receiving
it
descended
with
it
to
earth
and
laid
it
down
at
achilles
feet
at
the
dawn
of
day
the
first
glow
of
pleasure
that
achilles
had
felt
since
the
death
of
patroclus
was
at
the
sight
of
this
splendid
armor
and
now
arrayed
in
it
he
went
forth
into
the
camp
calling
all
the
chiefs
to
council
when
they
were
all
assembled
he
addressed
them
renouncing
his
displeasure
against
agamemnon
and
bitterly
lamenting
the
miseries
that
had
resulted
from
it
he
called
on
them
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
field
agamemnon
made
a
suitable
reply
laying
all
the
blame
on
ate
the
goddess
of
discord
and
thereupon
complete
reconcilement
took
place
between
the
heroes
then
achilles
went
forth
to
battle
inspired
with
a
rage
and
thirst
for
vengeance
that
made
him
irresistible
the
bravest
warriors
fled
before
him
or
fell
by
his
lance
hector
cautioned
by
apollo
kept
aloof
but
the
god
assuming
the
form
of
one
of
priam
sons
lycaon
urged
aeneas
to
encounter
the
terrible
warrior
aeneas
though
he
felt
himself
unequal
did
not
decline
the
combat
he
hurled
his
spear
with
all
his
force
against
the
shield
the
work
of
vulcan
it
was
formed
of
five
metal
plates
two
were
of
brass
two
of
tin
and
one
of
gold
the
spear
pierced
two
thicknesses
but
was
stopped
in
the
third
achilles
threw
his
with
better
success
it
pierced
through
the
shield
of
aeneas
but
glanced
near
his
shoulder
and
made
no
wound
then
aeneas
seized
a
stone
such
as
two
men
of
modern
times
could
hardly
lift
and
was
about
to
throw
it
and
achilles
with
sword
drawn
was
about
to
rush
upon
him
when
neptune
who
looked
out
upon
the
contest
moved
with
pity
for
aeneas
who
he
saw
would
surely
fall
a
victim
if
not
speedily
rescued
spread
a
cloud
between
the
combatants
and
lifting
aeneas
from
the
ground
bore
him
over
the
heads
of
warriors
and
steeds
to
the
rear
of
the
battle
achilles
when
the
mist
cleared
away
looked
round
in
vain
for
his
adversary
and
acknowledging
the
prodigy
turned
his
arms
against
other
champions
but
none
dared
stand
before
him
and
priam
looking
down
from
the
city
walls
beheld
his
whole
army
in
full
flight
towards
the
city
he
gave
command
to
open
wide
the
gates
to
receive
the
fugitives
and
to
shut
them
as
soon
as
the
trojans
should
have
passed
lest
the
enemy
should
enter
likewise
but
achilles
was
so
close
in
pursuit
that
that
would
have
been
impossible
if
apollo
had
not
in
the
form
of
agenor
priam
son
encountered
achilles
for
a
while
then
turned
to
fly
and
taken
the
way
apart
from
the
city
achilles
pursued
and
had
chased
his
supposed
victim
far
from
the
walls
when
apollo
disclosed
himself
and
achilles
perceiving
how
he
had
been
deluded
gave
up
the
chase
but
when
the
rest
had
escaped
into
the
town
hector
stood
without
determined
to
await
the
combat
his
old
father
called
to
him
from
the
walls
and
begged
him
to
retire
nor
tempt
the
encounter
his
mother
hecuba
also
besought
him
to
the
same
effect
but
all
in
vain
how
can
i
said
he
to
himself
by
whose
command
the
people
went
to
this
day
contest
where
so
many
have
fallen
seek
safety
for
myself
against
a
single
foe
but
what
if
i
offer
him
to
yield
up
helen
and
all
her
treasures
and
ample
of
our
own
beside
ah
no
it
is
too
late
he
would
not
even
hear
me
through
but
slay
me
while
i
spoke
while
he
thus
ruminated
achilles
approached
terrible
as
mars
his
armor
flashing
lightning
as
he
moved
at
that
sight
hector
heart
failed
him
and
he
fled
achilles
swiftly
pursued
they
ran
still
keeping
near
the
walls
till
they
had
thrice
encircled
the
city
as
often
as
hector
approached
the
walls
achilles
intercepted
him
and
forced
him
to
keep
out
in
a
wider
circle
but
apollo
sustained
hector
strength
and
would
not
let
him
sink
in
weariness
then
pallas
assuming
the
form
of
deiphobus
hector
bravest
brother
appeared
suddenly
at
his
side
hector
saw
him
with
delight
and
thus
strengthened
stopped
his
flight
and
turned
to
meet
achilles
hector
threw
his
spear
which
struck
the
shield
of
achilles
and
bounded
back
he
turned
to
receive
another
from
the
hand
of
deiphobus
but
deiphobus
was
gone
then
hector
understood
his
doom
and
said
alas
it
is
plain
this
is
my
hour
to
die
i
thought
deiphobus
at
hand
but
pallas
deceived
me
and
he
is
still
in
troy
but
i
will
not
fall
inglorious
so
saying
he
drew
his
falchion
from
his
side
and
rushed
at
once
to
combat
achilles
secured
behind
his
shield
waited
the
approach
of
hector
when
he
came
within
reach
of
his
spear
achilles
choosing
with
his
eye
a
vulnerable
part
where
the
armor
leaves
the
neck
uncovered
aimed
his
spear
at
that
part
and
hector
fell
and
feebly
said
spare
my
body
let
my
parents
ransom
it
and
let
me
receive
funeral
rites
from
the
sons
and
daughters
of
troy
to
which
achilles
replied
dog
name
not
ransom
nor
pity
to
me
on
whom
you
have
brought
such
dire
distress
no
trust
me
naught
shall
save
thy
carcass
from
the
dogs
though
twenty
ransoms
and
thy
weight
in
gold
were
offered
i
would
refuse
it
all
so
saying
he
stripped
the
body
of
its
armor
and
fastening
cords
to
the
feet
tied
them
behind
his
chariot
leaving
the
body
to
trail
along
the
ground
then
mounting
the
chariot
he
lashed
the
steeds
and
so
dragged
the
body
to
and
fro
before
the
city
what
words
can
tell
the
grief
of
king
priam
and
queen
hecuba
at
this
sight
his
people
could
scarce
restrain
the
old
king
from
rushing
forth
he
threw
himself
in
the
dust
and
besought
them
each
by
name
to
give
him
way
hecuba
distress
was
not
less
violent
the
citizens
stood
round
them
weeping
the
sound
of
the
mourning
reached
the
ears
of
andromache
the
wife
of
hector
as
she
sat
among
her
maidens
at
work
and
anticipating
evil
she
went
forth
to
the
wall
when
she
saw
the
sight
there
presented
she
would
have
thrown
herself
headlong
from
the
wall
but
fainted
and
fell
into
the
arms
of
her
maidens
recovering
she
bewailed
her
fate
picturing
to
herself
her
country
ruined
herself
a
captive
and
her
son
dependent
for
his
bread
on
the
charity
of
strangers
when
achilles
and
the
greeks
had
taken
their
revenge
on
the
killer
of
patroclus
they
busied
themselves
in
paying
due
funeral
rites
to
their
friend
a
pile
was
erected
and
the
body
burned
with
due
solemnity
and
then
ensued
games
of
strength
and
skill
chariot
races
wrestling
boxing
and
archery
then
the
chiefs
sat
down
to
the
funeral
banquet
and
after
that
retired
to
rest
but
achilles
neither
partook
of
the
feast
nor
of
sleep
the
recollection
of
his
lost
friend
kept
him
awake
remembering
their
companionship
in
toil
and
dangers
in
battle
or
on
the
perilous
deep
before
the
earliest
dawn
he
left
his
tent
and
joining
to
his
chariot
his
swift
steeds
he
fastened
hector
body
to
be
dragged
behind
twice
he
dragged
him
around
the
tomb
of
patroclus
leaving
him
at
length
stretched
in
the
dust
but
apollo
would
not
permit
the
body
to
be
torn
or
disfigured
with
all
this
abuse
but
preserved
it
free
from
all
taint
or
defilement
while
achilles
indulged
his
wrath
in
thus
disgracing
brave
hector
jupiter
in
pity
summoned
thetis
to
his
presence
he
told
her
to
go
to
her
son
and
prevail
on
him
to
restore
the
body
of
hector
to
his
friends
then
jupiter
sent
iris
to
king
priam
to
encourage
him
to
go
to
achilles
and
beg
the
body
of
his
son
iris
delivered
her
message
and
priam
immediately
prepared
to
obey
he
opened
his
treasuries
and
took
out
rich
garments
and
cloths
with
ten
talents
in
gold
and
two
splendid
tripods
and
a
golden
cup
of
matchless
workmanship
then
he
called
to
his
sons
and
bade
them
draw
forth
his
litter
and
place
in
it
the
various
articles
designed
for
a
ransom
to
achilles
when
all
was
ready
the
old
king
with
a
single
companion
as
aged
as
himself
the
herald
idaeus
drove
forth
from
the
gates
parting
there
with
hecuba
his
queen
and
all
his
friends
who
lamented
him
as
going
to
certain
death
but
jupiter
beholding
with
compassion
the
venerable
king
sent
mercury
to
be
his
guide
and
protector
mercury
assuming
the
form
of
a
young
warrior
presented
himself
to
the
aged
couple
and
while
at
the
sight
of
him
they
hesitated
whether
to
fly
or
yield
the
god
approached
and
grasping
priam
hand
offered
to
be
their
guide
to
achilles
tent
priam
gladly
accepted
his
offered
service
and
he
mounting
the
carriage
assumed
the
reins
and
soon
conveyed
them
to
the
tent
of
achilles
mercury
wand
put
to
sleep
all
the
guards
and
without
hinderance
he
introduced
priam
into
the
tent
where
achilles
sat
attended
by
two
of
his
warriors
the
old
king
threw
himself
at
the
feet
of
achilles
and
kissed
those
terrible
hands
which
had
destroyed
so
many
of
his
sons
think
o
achilles
he
said
of
thy
own
father
full
of
days
like
me
and
trembling
on
the
gloomy
verge
of
life
perhaps
even
now
some
neighbor
chief
oppresses
him
and
there
is
none
at
hand
to
succor
him
in
his
distress
yet
doubtless
knowing
that
achilles
lives
he
still
rejoices
hoping
that
one
day
he
shall
see
thy
face
again
but
no
comfort
cheers
me
whose
bravest
sons
so
late
the
flower
of
ilium
all
have
fallen
yet
one
i
had
one
more
than
all
the
rest
the
strength
of
my
age
whom
fighting
for
his
country
thou
hast
slain
i
come
to
redeem
his
body
bringing
inestimable
ransom
with
me
achilles
reverence
the
gods
recollect
thy
father
for
his
sake
show
compassion
to
me
these
words
moved
achilles
and
he
wept
remembering
by
turns
his
absent
father
and
his
lost
friend
moved
with
pity
of
priam
silver
locks
and
beard
he
raised
him
from
the
earth
and
thus
spake
priam
i
know
that
thou
hast
reached
this
place
conducted
by
some
god
for
without
aid
divine
no
mortal
even
in
his
prime
of
youth
had
dared
the
attempt
i
grant
thy
request
moved
thereto
by
the
evident
will
of
jove
so
saying
he
arose
and
went
forth
with
his
two
friends
and
unloaded
of
its
charge
the
litter
leaving
two
mantles
and
a
robe
for
the
covering
of
the
body
which
they
placed
on
the
litter
and
spread
the
garments
over
it
that
not
unveiled
it
should
be
borne
back
to
troy
then
achilles
dismissed
the
old
king
with
his
attendants
having
first
pledged
himself
to
allow
a
truce
of
twelve
days
for
the
funeral
solemnities
as
the
litter
approached
the
city
and
was
descried
from
the
walls
the
people
poured
forth
to
gaze
once
more
on
the
face
of
their
hero
foremost
of
all
the
mother
and
the
wife
of
hector
came
and
at
the
sight
of
the
lifeless
body
renewed
their
lamentations
the
people
all
wept
with
them
and
to
the
going
down
of
the
sun
there
was
no
pause
or
abatement
of
their
grief
the
next
day
preparations
were
made
for
the
funeral
solemnities
for
nine
days
the
people
brought
wood
and
built
the
pile
and
on
the
tenth
they
placed
the
body
on
the
summit
and
applied
the
torch
while
all
troy
thronging
forth
encompassed
the
pile
when
it
had
completely
burned
they
quenched
the
cinders
with
wine
collected
the
bones
and
placed
them
in
a
golden
urn
which
they
buried
in
the
earth
and
reared
a
pile
of
stones
over
the
spot

but
when
the
hero
bent
over
his
fallen
foe
and
contemplated
her
beauty
youth
and
valor
he
bitterly
regretted
his
victory
thersites
an
insolent
brawler
and
demagogue
ridiculed
his
grief
and
was
in
consequence
slain
by
the
hero
achilles
by
chance
had
seen
polyxena
daughter
of
king
priam
perhaps
on
the
occasion
of
the
truce
which
was
allowed
the
trojans
for
the
burial
of
hector
he
was
captivated
with
her
charms
and
to
win
her
in
marriage
agreed
to
use
his
influence
with
the
greeks
to
grant
peace
to
troy
while
in
the
temple
of
apollo
negotiating
the
marriage
paris
discharged
at
him
a
poisoned
arrow
which
guided
by
apollo
wounded
achilles
in
the
heel
the
only
vulnerable
part
about
him
for
thetis
his
mother
had
dipped
him
when
an
infant
in
the
river
styx
which
made
every
part
of
him
invulnerable
except
the
heel
by
which
she
held
him
footnote
the
story
of
the
invulnerability
of
achilles
is
not
found
in
homer
and
is
inconsistent
with
his
account
for
how
could
achilles
require
the
aid
of
celestial
armor
if
be
were
invulnerable
the
body
of
achilles
so
treacherously
slain
was
rescued
by
ajax

thetis
directed
the
greeks
to
bestow
her
son
armor
on
the
hero
who
of
all
the
survivors
should
be
judged
most
deserving
of
it
ajax
and
ulysses
were
the
only
claimants
a
select
number
of
the
other
chiefs
were
appointed
to
award
the
prize
it
was
awarded
to
ulysses
thus
placing
wisdom
before
valor
whereupon
ajax
slew
himself
on
the
spot
where
his
blood
sank
into
the
earth
a
flower
sprang
up
called
the
hyacinth
bearing
on
its
leaves
the
first
two
letters
of
the
name
of
ajax
ai
the
greek
for
woe
thus
ajax
is
a
claimant
with
the
boy
hyacinthus
for
the
honor
of
giving
birth
to
this
flower
there
is
a
species
of

by
the

were
in
possession
of
philoctetes

had
accidentally
wounded
his
foot
with

of

poisoned
arrows

the
smell
from

wound
proved
so
offensive
that
his

carried
him
to

to
rejoin

he
sukcceeded
philoctetes
was
cured
of
his
wound
by
machaon
and
paris
was
the
first
victim
of
the
fatal
arrows
in
his
distress
paris
bethought
him
of
one
whom
in
his
prosperity
he
had
forgotten
this
was
the
nymph
oenone
whom
he
had
married
when
a
youth
and
had
abandoned
for
the
fatal
beauty
helen
oenone
remembering
the
wrongs
she
had
suffered
refused
to
heal
the
wound
and
paris
went
back
to
troy
and
died
oenone
quickly
repented
and
hastened
after
him
with
remedies
but
came
too
late
and
in
her
grief
hung
herself

oenone
as

the

cruelty
and
subsequent
repentance
there
was
in
troy
a
celebrated
statue
of
minerva
called
the
palladium
it
was
said
to
have
fallen
from
heaven
and
the
belief
was
that
the
city
could
not
be
taken
so

remained
within

diomed
entered
the
city
in

and
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
palladium
which
they
carried
off
to
the
grecian
camp
but
troy
still
held
out
and
the
greeks
began
to
despair
of
ever
subduing
it
by
force
and
by
advice
of
ulysses
resolved
to
resort
to
stratagem
they
pretended
to
be
making
preparations
to
abandon
the
siege
and
a
portion
of
the
ships
were
withdrawn
and
lay
hid
behind
a
neighboring
island
the
greeks
then
constructed
an
immense
wooden
horse
which
they
gave
out
was
intended
as
a
propitiatory
offering
to
minerva
but
in
fact
was
filled
with
armed
men
the
remaining
greeks
then
betook
themselves
to
their
ships
and
sailed
away
as
if
for
a
final
departure
the
trojans

the
encampment
broken
up
and

gone
concluded
the

to

the
whole
population
issued
forth
rejoicing
at
the
liberty
of
passing
freely
over
the
scene
of

late
encampment
the
great
horse
was
the

all
wondered
what
it
could
be
for

recommended
to
take
it
into

others
felt
afraid
of

saying
he
threw
his

at

side
it
struck
and
a
hollow
sound
reverberated
like
a
groan
then
perhaps
the
people
might
have
taken
his
advice
and
destroyed
the
fatal
horse
and
all
its
contents
but
just
at
that
moment
a
group
of
people
appeared
dragging
forward
one
who
seemed
a
prisoner
and
a
greek
stupefied
with
terror
he
was
brought
before
the

reassured
him
promising
that
his
life
should
be
spared
on

of
his
returning
true
answers

asked
him
he
informed
them
that
he

greek
sinon

and
that
in

of
the
malice
of
ulysses
he
had
been
left
behind
by
his
countrymen
at
their
departure
with

to
the
wooden
horse
he
told
them
that
it
was

made
so
huge
for
the
express
purpose
of
preventing
its
being
carried
within
the
city

the
prophet
had
told
them
that
if
the
trojans
took

it
they
would
assuredly
triumph
over
the
greeks
this
language
turned
the
tide

they
began
to
think
how
they
might
best
secure
the
monstrous
horse
and
the
favorable
auguries
connected
with
it
when
suddenly
a
prodigy
occurred
which
left
no
room
to
doubt
there
appeared
advancing
over
the
sea
two
immense
serpents
they
came
upon
the
land
and
the
crowd
fled
in
all
directions
the
serpents
advanced
directly
to
the
spot
where
laocoon
stood
with
his
two
sons
they
first
attacked
the
children
winding
round
their
bodies
and
breathing
their
pestilential
breath
in
their
faces
the
father
attempting
to
rescue
them
is
next
seized
and
involved
in
the
serpents
coils
he
struggles
to
tear
them
away
but
they
overpower
all
his
efforts
and
strangle
him
and
the
children
in
their
poisonous
folds
this
event
was
regarded
as
a
clear
indication
of
the
displeasure
of
the
gods
at
irreverent
treatment
of
the
wooden
horse
which
they
no
longer
hesitated
to
regard
as
a
sacred
object
and
prepared
to
introduce
with
due
solemnity
into
the

this
was
done
with
songs

frequently
reminded

up

abhorrence
that
it
does

eumenides
avenging
deities
seized
upon

and
drove
him
frantic
from
land
to
land
pylades
accompanied
him
in
his
wanderings
and
watched
over
him
at
length
in
answer
to
a
second
appeal
to
the
oracle
he
was
directed
to
go
to
tauris
in
scythia
and
to
bring
thence
a
statue
of
diana
which
was
believed
to
have
fallen
from
heaven
accordingly
orestes
and
pylades
went
to
tauris
where
the
barbarous
people
were
accustomed
to
sacrifice
to
the
goddess
all
strangers
who
fell
into
their
hands
the
two
friends
were
seized
and
carried
bound
to

temple
to
be
made
victims
but
the
priestess
of
diana
was
no
other
than
iphigenia
the
sister
of
orestes
who
our
readers
will
remember
was
snatched
away
by
diana
at
the
moment
when
she
was
about
to
be
sacrificed
ascertaining
from
the
prisoners
who
they
were
iphigenia
disclosed
herself
to
them
and
the
three
made
their
escape
with
the
statue
of
the
goddess
and
returned
to
mycenae
but
orestes
was
not
yet
relieved
from
the
vengeance
of
the
erinyes
at
length
he
took
refuge
with
minerva
at
athens
the
goddess
afforded
him
protection
and
appointed
the
court
of
areopagus
to
decide
his
fate
the
erinyes
brought
forward
their
accusation
and
orestes
made
the
command
of
the
delphic
oracle
his
excuse
when
the
court
voted
and

voices
were
equally
divided

the
facts
relating
to
the
city
of
troy
are
still
unknown
to
history
antiquarians
have
long
sought
for
the
actual
city
and
some
record
of
its
rulers
the
most
interesting
explorations
were
those
conducted
about
by
the
german
scholar
henry
schliemann
who
believed
that
at
the
mound
of
hissarlik
the
traditional
site
of
troy
he
had
uncovered
the
ancient
capital
schliemann
excavated
down
below
the
ruins
of
three
or
four
settlements
each
revealing
an
earlier
civilization
and
finally
came
upon
some
royal
jewels
and
other
relics
said
to
be
treasure
scholars
are
by
no
means
agreed

the
historic
value

with
the
inhabitants
ulysses
lost
six
men
from
each
ship
sailing
thence
they
were
overtaken
by

which

them
for
nine
days
along

till
they
reached

sent
three
of

men
to
discover
who
the

were
kindly
entertained
by
them
and
were
given
some
of
their
own
food

the
effect
of
this
food
was
such
that
those
who
partook
of
it
lost
all
thoughts
of
home
and
wished
to
remain
in
that
country
it
was
by
main
force
that
ulysses
dragged
these
men
away
and
he
was
even
obliged
to
tie
them
under
the
benches
of
the
ships
footnote

charmingly
expressed
the
dreamy
languid
feeling
which
the

is
said
to
have
produced
how
sweet
it
were
hearing
the
downward
stream
with
eyes
ever
to
seem
falling
asleep
in
a
half
dream
to
dream

day

to
watch
the
crisping
ripples
on
the
beach
and
tender
curving
lines
of
creamy
spray
to
lend
our
hearts
and
spirits
wholly
to
the
influence
of
melancholy
to
muse
and
brood
and
live
again
in
memory
with
those
old
faces
of
our
infancy
heaped
over
with
a
mound
of
grass
two
handfuls
of
white
dust
shut
in
an
urn
of
brass
they
next
arrived
at
the
country
of
the
cyclopes
the
cyclopes
were
giants
who
inhabited
an
island
of
which
they
were
the
only
possessors
the
name
means
round
eye
and
these
giants
were
so
called
because
they
had
but
one
eye
and
that
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
they
dwelt
in
caves
and
fed
on
the
wild
productions
of
the
island
and
on
what
their
flocks
yielded
for
they
were
shepherds
ulysses
left
the
main
body
of
his
ships
at
anchor
and
with
one
vessel
went
to
the
cyclopes
island
to
explore
for
supplies
he
landed
with
his
companions
carrying
with
them
a
jar
of
wine
for
a
present
and
coming
to
a
large
cave
they
entered
it
and
finding
no
one
within
examined
its
contents
they
found
it
stored
with
the
richest
of
the
flock
quantities
of
cheese
pails
and
bowls
of
milk
lambs
and
kids
in
their
pens
all
in
nice
order
presently
arrived
the
master
of
the
cave
polyphemus
bearing
an
immense
bundle
of
firewood
which
he
threw
down
before
the
cavern
mouth
he
then
drove
into
the
cave
the
sheep
and
goats
to
be
milked
and
entering
rolled
to
the
mouth
an
enormous
rock
that
twenty
oxen
could
not
draw
next
he
sat
down
and
milked
his
ewes
preparing
a
part
for
cheese
and
setting
the
rest
aside
for
his
customary
drink
then
turning
round
his
great
eye
he
discerned
the
strangers
and
growled
out
to
them
demanding
who
they
were
and
where
from
ulysses
replied
most
humbly
stating
that
they
were
greeks
from
the
great
expedition
that
had
lately
won
so
much
glory
in
the
conquest
of
troy
that
they
were
now
on
their
way
home
and
finished
by
imploring
his
hospitality
in
the
name
of
the
gods
polyphemus
deigned
no
answer
but
reaching
out
his
hand
seized
two
of
the
greeks
whom
he
hurled
against
the
side
of
the
cave
and
dashed
out
their
brains
he
proceeded
to
devour
them
with
great
relish
and
having
made
a
hearty
meal
stretched
himself
out
on
the
floor
to
sleep
ulysses
was
tempted
to
seize
the
opportunity
and
plunge
his
sword
into
him
as
he
slept
but
recollected
that
it
would
only
expose
them
all
to
certain
destruction
as
the
rock
with
which
the
giant
had
closed
up
the
door
was
far
beyond
their
power
to
remove
and
they
would
therefore
be
in
hopeless
imprisonment
next
morning
the
giant
seized
two
more
of
the
greeks
and
despatched
them
in
the
same
manner
as
their
companions
feasting
on
their
flesh
till
no
fragment
was
left
he
then
moved
away
the
rock
from
the
door
drove
out
his
flocks
and
went
out
carefully
replacing
the
barrier
after
him
when
he
was
gone
ulysses
planned
how
he
might
take
vengeance
for
his
murdered
friends
and
effect
his
escape
with
his
surviving
companions
he
made
his
men
prepare
a
massive
bar
of
wood
cut
by
the
cyclops
for
a
staff
which
they
found
in
the
cave
they
sharpened
the
end
of
it
and
seasoned
it
in
the
fire
and
hid
it
under
the
straw
on
the
cavern
floor
then
four
of
the
boldest
were
selected
with
whom
ulysses
joined
himself
as
a
fifth
the
cyclops
came
home
at
evening
rolled
away
the
stone
and
drove
in
his
flock
as
usual
after
milking
them
and
making
his
arrangements
as
before
he
seized
two
more
of
ulysses
companions
and
dashed
their
brains
out
and
made
his
evening
meal
upon
them
as
he
had
on
the
others
after
he
had
supped
ulysses
approaching
him
handed
him
a
bowl
of
wine
saying
cyclops
this
is
wine
taste
and
drink
after
thy
meal
of
men
flesh
he
took
and
drank
it
and
was
hugely
delighted
with
it
and
called
for
more
ulysses
supplied
him
once
again
which
pleased
the
giant
so
much
that
he
promised
him
as
a
favor
that
he
should
be
the
last
of
the
party
devoured
he
asked
his
name
to
which
ulysses
replied
my
name
is
noman
after
his
supper
the
giant
lay
down
to
repose
and
was
soon
sound
asleep
then
ulysses
with
his
four
select
friends
thrust
the
end
of
the
stake
into
the
fire
till
it
was
all
one
burning
coal
then
poising
it
exactly
above
the
giant
only
eye
they
buried
it
deeply
into
the
socket
twirling
it
round
as
a
carpenter
does
his
auger
the
howling
monster
with
his
outcry
filled
the
cavern
and
ulysses
with
his
aids
nimbly
got
out
of
his
way
and
concealed
themselves
in
the
cave
he
bellowing
called
aloud
on
all
the
cyclopes
dwelling
in
the
caves
around
him
far
and
near
they
on
his
cry
flocked
round
the
den
and
inquired
what
grievous
hurt
had
caused
him
to
sound
such
an
alarm
and
break
their
slumbers
he
replied
o
friends
i
die
and
noman
gives
the
blow
they
answered
if
no
man
hurts
thee
it
is
the
stroke
of
jove
and
thou
must
bear
it
so
saying
they
left
him
groaning
next
morning
the
cyclops
rolled
away
the
stone
to
let
his
flock
out
to
pasture
but
planted
himself
in
the
door
of
the
cave
to
feel
of
all
as
they
went
out
that
ulysses
and
his
men
should
not
escape
with
them
but
ulysses
had
made
his
men
harness
the
rams
of
the
flock
three
abreast
with
osiers
which
they
found
on
the
floor
of
the
cave
to
the
middle
ram
of
the
three
one
of
the
greeks
suspended
himself
so
protected
by
the
exterior
rams
on
either
side
as
they
passed
the
giant
felt
of
the
animals
backs
and
sides
but
never
thought
of
their
bellies
so
the
men
all
passed
safe
ulysses
himself
being
on
the
last
one
that
passed
when
they
had
got
a
few
paces
from
the
cavern
ulysses
and
his
friends
released
themselves
from
their
rams
and
drove
a
good
part
of
the
flock
down
to
the
shore
to
their
boat
they
put
them
aboard
with
all
haste
then
pushed
off
from
the
shore
and
when
at
a
safe
distance
ulysses
shouted
out
cyclops
the
gods
have
well
requited
thee
for
thy
atrocious
deeds
know
it
is
ulysses
to
whom
thou
owest
thy
shameful
loss
of
sight
the
cyclops
hearing
this
seized
a
rock
that
projected
from
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
rending
it
from
its
bed
he
lifted
it
high
in
the
air
then
exerting
all
his
force
hurled
it
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
down
came
the
mass
just
clearing
the
vessel
stern
the
ocean
at
the
plunge
of
the
huge
rock
heaved
the
ship
towards
the
land
so
that
it
barely
escaped
being
swamped
by
the
waves
when
they
had
with
the
utmost
difficulty
pulled
off
shore
ulysses
was
about
to
hail
the
giant
again
but
his
friends
besought
him
not
to
do
so
he
could
not
forbear
however
letting
the
giant
know
that
they
had
escaped
his
missile
but
waited
till
they
had
reached
a
safer
distance
than
before
the
giant
answered
them
with
curses
but
ulysses
and
his
friends
plied
their
oars
vigorously
and
soon
regained
their
companions
ulysses
next
arrived
at
the
island
of
aeolus
to
this
monarch
jupiter
had
intrusted
the
government
of
the
winds
to
send
them
forth
or
retain
them
at
his
will
he
treated
ulysses
hospitably
and
at
his
departure
gave
him
tied
up
in
a
leathern
bag
with
a
silver
string
such
winds
as
might
be
hurtful
and
dangerous
commanding
fair
winds
to
blow
the
barks
towards
their
country
nine
days
they
sped
before
the
wind
and
all
that
time
ulysses
had
stood
at
the
helm
without
sleep
at
last
quite
exhausted
he
lay
down
to
sleep
while
he
slept
the
crew
conferred
together
about
the
mysterious
bag
and
concluded
it
must
contain
treasures
given
by
the
hospitable
king
aeolus
to
their
commander
tempted
to
secure
some
portion
for
themselves
they
loosed
the
string
when
immediately
the
winds
rushed
forth
the
ships
were
driven
far
from
their
course
and
back
again
to
the
island
they
had
just
left
aeolus
was
so
indignant
at
their
folly
that
he
refused
to
assist
them
further
and
they
were
obliged
to
labor
over
their
course
once
more
by
means
of
their
oars
the
laestrygonians
their
next
adventure
was
with
the
barbarous
tribe
of
laestrygonians
the
vessels
all
pushed
into
the
harbor
tempted
by
the
secure
appearance
of
the
cove
completely
only
ulysses
moored
his
vessel
without
as
soon
as
the
laestrygonians
found
the
ships
completely
in
their
power
they
attacked
them
heaving
huge
stones
which
broke
and
overturned
them
and
with
their
spears
despatched
the
seamen
as
they
struggled
in
the
water
all
the
vessels
with
their
crews
were
destroyed
except
own
ship
which
had
remained
outside
and
finding
no
safety
but
in
flight
he
exhorted
his
men
to
ply
their
oars
vigorously
and
they
escaped
with
grief
for
their
slain
companions
mixed
with
joy
at
their
own
escape
they
pursued
their
way
till
they
arrived
at
the
aeaean
isle
where
circe
dwelt
the
daughter
of
the
sun
landing
here
ulysses
climbed
a
hill
and
gazing
round
saw
no
signs
of
habitation
except
in
one
spot
at
the
centre
of
the
island
where
he
perceived
a
palace
embowered
with
trees
he
sent
forward
half
of
his
crew
under
the
command
of
eurylochus
to
see
what
prospect
of
hospitality
they
might
find
as
they
approached
the
palace
they
found
themselves
surrounded
by
lions
tigers
and
wolves
not
fierce
but
tamed
by
circe
art
for
she
was
a
powerful
magician
all
these
animals
had
once
been
men
but
had
been
changed
by
circe
enchantments
into
the
forms
of
beasts
the
sounds
of
soft
music
were
heard
from
within
and
a
sweet
female
voice
singing
eurylochus
called
aloud
and
the
goddess
came
forth
and
invited
them
in
they
all
gladly
entered
except
eurylochus
who
suspected
danger
the
goddess
conducted
her
guests
to
a
seat
and
had
them
served
with
wine
and
other
delicacies
when
they
had
feasted
heartily
she
touched
them
one
by
one
with
her
wand
and
they
became
immediately
changed
into
swine
in
head
body
voice
and
bristles
yet
with
their
intellects
as
before
she
shut
them
in
her
sties
and
supplied
them
with
acorns
and
such
other
things
as
swine
love
eurylochus
hurried
back
to
the
ship
and
told
the
tale
ulysses
thereupon
determined
to
go
himself
and
try
if
by
any
means
he
might
deliver
his
companions
as
he
strode
onward
alone
he
met
a
youth
who
addressed
him
familiarly
appearing
to
be
acquainted
with
his
adventures
he
announced
himself
as
mercury
and
informed
ulysses
of
the
arts
of
circe
and
of
the
danger
of
approaching
her
as
ulysses
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
from
his
attempt
mercury
provided
him
with
a
sprig
of
the
plant
moly
of
wonderful
power
to
resist
sorceries
and
instructed
him
how
to
act
ulysses
proceeded
and
reaching
the
palace
was
courteously
received
by
circe
who
entertained
him
as
she
had
done
his
companions
and
after
he
had
eaten
and
drank
touched
him
with
her
wand
saying
hence
seek
the
sty
and
wallow
with
thy
friends
but
he
instead
of
obeying
drew
his
sword
and
rushed
upon
her
with
fury
in
his
countenance
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
begged
for
mercy
he
dictated
a
solemn
oath
that
she
would
release
his
companions
and
practise
no
further
harm
against
him
or
them
and
she
repeated
it
at
the
same
time
promising
to
dismiss
them
all
in
safety
after
hospitably
entertaining
them
she
was
as
good
as
her
word
the
men
were
restored
to
their
shapes
the
rest
of
the
crew
summoned
from
the
shore
and
the
whole
magnificently
entertained
day
after
day
till
ulysses
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
native
land
and
to
have
reconciled
himself
to
an
inglorious
life
of
ease
and
pleasure
at
length
his
companions
recalled
him
to
nobler
sentiments
and
he
received
their
admonition
gratefully
circe
aided
their
departure
and
instructed
them
how
to
pass
safely
by
the
coast
of
the
sirens
the
sirens
were
who
had
the
power
of
charming
by
their
song
all
who
heard
them
so
that
the
unhappy
mariners
were
irresistibly
impelled
to
cast
themselves
into
the
sea
to
their
destruction
circe
directed
ulysses
to
fill
the
ears
of
his
seamen
with
wax
so
that
they
should
not
hear
the
strain
and
to
cause
himself
to
be
bound
to
the
mast
and
his
people
to
be
strictly
enjoined
whatever
he
might
say
or
do
by
no
means
to
release
him
till
they
should
have
passed
the
sirens
island
ulysses
obeyed
these
directions
he
filled
the
ears
of
his
people
with
wax
and
suffered
them
to
bind
him
with
cords
firmly
to
the
mast
as
they
approached
the
sirens
island
the
sea
was
calm
and
over
the
waters
came
the
notes
of
music
so
ravishing
and
attractive
that
ulysses
struggled
to
get
loose
and
by
cries
and
signs
to
his
people
begged
to
be
released
but
they
obedient
to
his
previous
orders
sprang
forward
and
bound
him
still
faster
they
held
on
their
course
and
the
music
grew
fainter
till
it
ceased
to
be
heard
when
with
joy
ulysses
gave
his
companions
the
signal
to
unseal
their
ears
and
they
relieved
him
from
his
bonds
the
imagination
of
a
modern
poet
keats
has
discovered
for
us
the
thoughts
that
passed
through
the
brains
of
the
victims
of
circe
after
their
transformation
in
his
endymion
he
represents
one
of
them
a
monarch
in
the
guise
of
an
elephant
addressing
the
sorceress
in
human
language
thus
i
sue
not
for
my
happy
crown
again
i
sue
not
for
my
phalanx
on
the
plain
i
sue
not
for
my
lone
my
widowed
wife
i
sue
not
for
my
ruddy
drops
of
life
my
children
fair
my
lovely

boys
i
will
forget
them
i
will
pass
these
joys
ask
nought
so
heavenward
so
too
too
high
only
i
pray
as
fairest
boon
to
die
to
be
delivered
from
this
cumbrous
flesh
from
this
gross
detestable
filthy
mesh
and
merely
given
to
the
cold
bleak

have

feel
my
prayer
scylla
and
charybdis
ulysses
had
been
warned
by
circe
of
the
two
monsters
scylla
and
charybdis
we
have
already
met
with
scylla
in
the
story
of
glaucus
and
remember
that
she
was
once
a
beautiful
maiden
and
was
changed
into
a
snaky
monster
by
circe
she
dwelt
in
a
cave
high
up
on
the
cliff
from
whence
she
was
accustomed
to
thrust
forth
her
long
necks
for
she
had
six
heads
and
in
each
of
her
mouths
to
seize
one
of
the
crew
of
every
vessel
passing
within
reach
the
other
terror
charybdis
was
a
gulf
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
water
thrice
each
day
the
water
rushed
into
a
frightful
chasm
and
thrice
was
disgorged
any
vessel
coming
near
the
whirlpool
when
the
tide
was
rushing
in
must
inevitably
be
ingulfed
not
neptune
himself
could
save
it
on
approaching
the
haunt
of
the
dread
monsters
ulysses
kept
strict
watch
to
discover
them
the
roar
of
the
waters
as
charybdis
ingulfed
them
gave
warning
at
a
distance
but
scylla
could
nowhere
be
discerned
while
ulysses
and
his
men
watched
with
anxious
eyes
the
dreadful
whirlpool
they
were
not
equally
on
their
guard
from
the
attack
of
scylla
and
the
monster
darting
forth
her
snaky
heads
caught
six
of
his
men
and
bore
them
away
shrieking
to
her
den
it
was
the
saddest
sight
ulysses
had
yet
seen
to
behold
his
friends
thus
sacrificed
and
hear
their
cries
unable
to
afford
them
any
assistance
circe
had
warned
him
of
another
danger
after
passing
scylla
and
charybdis
the
next
land
he
would
make
was
thrinakia
an
island
whereon
were
pastured
the
cattle
of
hyperion
the
sun
tended
by
his
daughters
lampetia
and
phaethusa
these
flocks
must
not
be
violated
whatever
the
wants
of
the
voyagers
might
be
if
this
injunction
were
transgressed
destruction
was
sure
to
fall
on
the
offenders
ulysses
would
willingly
have
passed
the
island
of
the
sun
without
stopping
but
his
companions
so
urgently
pleaded
for
the
rest
and
refreshment
that
would
be
derived
from
anchoring
and
passing
the
night
on
shore
that
ulysses
yielded
he
bound
them
however
with
an
oath
that
they
would
not
touch
one
of
the
animals
of
the
sacred
flocks
and
herds
but
content
themselves
with
what
provision
they
yet
had
left
of
the
supply
which
circe
had
put
on
board
so
long
as
this
supply
lasted
the
people
kept
their
oath
but
contrary
winds
detained
them
at
the
island
for
a
month
and
after
consuming
all
their
stock
of
provisions
they
were
forced
to
rely
upon
the
birds
and
fishes
they
could
catch
famine
pressed
them
and
at
length
one
day
in
the
absence
of
ulysses
they
slew
some
of
the
cattle
vainly
attempting
to
make
amends
for
the
deed
by
offering
from
them
a
portion
to
the
offended
powers
ulysses
on
his
return
to
the
shore
was
at
perceiving
what
they
had
done
and
the
more
so
on
account
of
the
portentous
signs
which
followed
the
skins
crept
on
the
ground
and
the
joints
of
meat
lowed
on
the
spits
while
roasting
the
wind
becoming
fair
they
sailed
from
the
island
they
had
not
gone
far
when
the
weather
changed
and
a
storm
of
thunder
and
lightning
ensued
a
stroke
of
lightning
shattered
their
mast
which
in
its
fall
killed
the
pilot
at
last
the
vessel
itself
came
to
pieces
the
keel
and

floating

ulysses
formed
of
them
a
raft
to
which
he
clung
and
the
wind
changing
the
waves
bore
him
to

she
supplied
ulysses
with
the

constructing

for

in

arose
that
broke

asunder
in

was

by

who
in
the

of

alighted
on

presented
him
a

directing
him
to
bind
it
beneath

he

smoothed

him
a

that
rolled

towards
the

the

beat
high
on
the
rocks
and
seemed
to
forbid
approach
but
at
length
finding
calm
water
at
the
mouth
of
a
gentle
stream
he
landed
spent
with
toil
breathless
and
speechless
and
almost
dead
after
some
time
reviving
he
kissed
the
soil
rejoicing
yet
at
a
loss
what
course
to
take
at
a
short
distance
he
perceived
a
wood
to
which
he
turned
his
steps
there
finding
a
covert
sheltered
by
intermingling
branches
alike
from
the
sun
and
the
rain
he
collected
a
pile
of
leaves
and
formed
a
bed
on
which
he
stretched
himself
and
heaping
the
leaves
over
him
fell
asleep
the
land
where
he
was
thrown
was
scheria
the
country
of
the
phaeacians
these
people
dwelt
originally
near
the
cyclopes
but
being
oppressed
by
that
savage
race
they
migrated
to
the
isle
of
scheria
under
the
conduct
of
nausithous
their
king
they
were
the
poet
tells
us
a
people
akin
to
the
gods
who
appeared
manifestly
and
feasted
among
them
when
they
offered
sacrifices
and
did
not
conceal
themselves
from
solitary
wayfarers
when
they
met
them
they
had
abundance
of
wealth
and
lived
in
the
enjoyment
of
it
undisturbed
by
the
alarms
of
war
for
as
they
dwelt
remote
from
man
no
enemy
ever
approached
their
shores
and
they
did
not
even
require
to
make
use
of
bows
and
quivers
their
chief
employment
was
navigation
their
ships
which
went
with
the
velocity
of
birds
were
endued
with
intelligence
they
knew
every
port
and
needed
no
pilot
alcinous
the
son
of
nausithous
was
now
their
king
a
wise
and
just
sovereign
beloved
by
his
people
now
it
happened
that
the
very
night
on
which
ulysses
was
cast
ashore
on
the
phaeacian
island
and
while
he
lay
sleeping
on
his
bed
of
leaves
nausicaa
the
daughter
of
the
king
had
a
dream
sent
by
minerva
reminding
her
that
her
was
not
far
distant
and
that
it
would
be
but
a
prudent
preparation
for
that
event
to
have
a
general
washing
of
the
clothes
of
the
family
this
was
no
slight
affair
for
the
fountains
were
at
some
distance
and
the
garments
must
be
carried
thither
on
awaking
the
princess
hastened
to
her
parents
to
tell
them
what
was
on
her
mind
not
alluding
to
her
but
finding
other
reasons
equally
good
her
father
readily
assented
and
ordered
the
grooms
to
furnish
forth
a
wagon
for
the
purpose
the
clothes
were
put
therein
and
the
queen
mother
placed
in
the
wagon
likewise
an
abundant
supply
of
food
and
wine
the
princess
took
her
seat
and
plied
the
lash
her
attendant
virgins
following
her
on
foot
arrived
at
the
river
side
they
turned
out
the
mules
to
graze
and
unlading
the
carriage
bore
the
garments
down
to
the
water
and
working
with
cheerfulness
and
alacrity
soon
despatched
their
labor
then
having
spread
the
garments
on
the
shore
to
dry
and
having
themselves
bathed
they
sat
down
to
enjoy
their
meal
after
which
they
rose
and
amused
themselves
with
a
game
of
ball
the
princess
singing
to
them
while
they
played
but
when
they
had
refolded
the
apparel
and
were
about
to
resume
their
way
to
the
town
minerva
caused
the
ball
thrown
by
the
princess
to
fall
into
the
water
whereat
they
all
screamed
and
ulysses
awaked
at
the
sound
now
we
must
picture
to
ourselves
ulysses
a
mariner
but
a
few
hours
escaped
from
the
waves
and
utterly
destitute
of
clothing
awaking
and
discovering
that
only
a
few
bushes
were
interposed
tween
him
and
a
group
of
young
maidens
whom
by
their
deportment
and
attire
he
discovered
to
be
not
mere
peasant
girls
but
of
a
higher
class
sadly
needing
help
how
could
he
yet
venture
naked
as
he
was
to
discover
himself
and
make
his
wants
known
it
certainly
was
a
case
worthy
of
the
interposition
of
his
patron
goddess
minerva
who
never
failed
him
at
a
crisis
breaking
off
a
leafy
branch
from
a
tree
he
held
it
before
him
and
stepped
out
from
the
thicket
the
virgins
at
sight
of
him
fled
in
all
directions
nausicaa
alone
excepted
for
her
minerva
aided
and
endowed
with
courage
and
discernment
ulysses
standing
respectfully
aloof
told
his
sad
case
and
besought
the
fair
object
whether
queen
or
goddess
he
professed
he
knew
not
for
food
and
clothing
the
princess
replied
courteously
promising
present
relief
and
her
father
hospitality
when
he
should
become
acquainted
with
the
facts
she
called
back
her
scattered
maidens
chiding
their
alarm
and
reminding
them
that
the
phaeacians
had
no
enemies
to
fear
this
man
she
told
them
was
an
unhappy
wanderer
whom
it
was
a
duty
to
cherish
for
the
poor
and
stranger
are
from
jove
she
bade
them
bring
food
and
clothing
for
some
of
her
brother
garments
were
among
the
contents
of
the
wagon
when
this
was
done
and
ulysses
retiring
to
a
sheltered
place
had
washed
his
body
free
from
the
clothed
and
refreshed
himself
with
food
pallas
dilated
his
form
and
diffused
grace
over
his
ample
chest
and
manly
brows
the
princess
seeing
him
was
filled
with
admiration
and
scrupled
not
to
say
to
her
damsels
that
she
wished
the
gods
would
send
her
such
a
husband
to
ulysses
she
recommended
that
he
should
repair
to
the
city
following
herself
and
train
so
far
as
the
way
lay
through
the
fields
but
when
they
should
approach
the
city
she
desired
that
he
would
no
longer
be
seen
in
her
company
for
she
feared
the
remarks
which
rude
and
vulgar
people
might
make
on
seeing
her
return
accompanied
by
such
a
gallant
stranger
to
avoid
which
she
directed
him
to
stop
at
a
grove
adjoining
the
city
in
which
were
a
farm
and
garden
belonging
to
the
king
after
allowing
time
for
the
princess
and
her
companions
to
reach
the
city
he
was
then
to
pursue
his
way
thither
and
would
be
easily
guided
by
any
he
might
meet
to
the
royal
abode
ulysses
obeyed
the
directions
and
in
due
time
proceeded
to
the
city
on
approaching
which
he
met
a
young
woman
bearing
a
pitcher
forth
for
water
it
was
minerva
who
had
assumed
that
form
ulysses
accosted
her
and
desired
to
be
directed
to
the
palace
of
alcinous
the
king
the
maiden
replied
respectfully
offering
to
be
his
guide
for
the
palace
she
informed
him
stood
near
her
father
dwelling
under
the
guidance
of
the
goddess
and
by
her
power
enveloped
in
a
cloud
which
shielded
him
from
observation
ulysses
passed
among
the
busy
crowd
and
with
wonder
observed
their
harbor
their
ships
their
forum
the
resort
of
heroes
and
their
battlements
till
they
came
to
the
palace
where
the
goddess
having
first
given
him
some
information
of
the
country
king
and
people
he
was
about
to
meet
left
him
ulysses
before
entering
the
courtyard
of
the
palace
stood
and
surveyed
the
scene
its
splendor
astonished
him
brazen
walls
stretched
from
the
entrance
to
the
interior
house
of
which
the
doors
were
gold
the
doorposts
silver
the
lintels
silver
ornamented
with

on

were

of

wrought
in

standing
in
rows
as
if
to
guard
the
approach
along
the
walls
were

spread
through
all
their
length
with
mantles
of

texture
the
work
of

on

the

sat
and
feasted

ulysses
stood
gazing
in
admiration
unobserved
himself
for
the
cloud
which
minerva
spread
around
him
still
shielded
him
at
length
having
sufficiently
observed
the
scene
he
advanced
with
rapid
step
into
the
hall
where
the
chiefs
and
senators
were
assembled
pouring
libation
to
mercury
whose
worship
followed
the
evening
meal
just
then
minerva
dissolved
the
cloud
and
disclosed
him
to
the
assembled
chiefs
advancing
to
the
place
where
the
queen
sat
he
knelt
at
her
feet
and
implored
her
favor
and
assistance
to
enable
him
to
return
to
his
native
country
then
withdrawing
he
seated
himself
in
the
manner
of
suppliants
at
the
hearth
side
for
a
time
none
spoke
at
last
an
aged
statesman
addressing
the
king
said
it
is
not
fit
that
a
stranger
who
asks
our
hospitality
should
be
kept
waiting
in
suppliant
guise
none
welcoming
him
let
him
therefore
be
led
to
a
seat
among
us
and
supplied
with
food
and
wine
at
these
words
the
king
rising
gave
his
hand
to
ulysses
and
led
him
to
a
seat
displacing
thence
his
own
son
to
make
room
for
the
stranger
food
and
wine
were
set
before
him
and
he
ate
and
refreshed
himself
the
king
then
dismissed
his
guests
notifying
them
that
the
next
day
he
would
call
them
to
council
to
consider
what
had
best
be
done
for
the
stranger
when
the
guests
had
departed
and
ulysses
was
left
alone
with
the
king
and
queen
the
queen
asked
him
who
he
was
and
whence
he
came
and
recognizing
the
clothes
which
he
wore
as
those
which
her
maidens
and
herself
had
made
from
whom
he
received
those
garments
he
told
them
of
his
residence
in
calypso
isle
and
his
departure
thence
of
the
wreck
of
his
raft
his
escape
by
swimming
and
of
the
relief
afforded
by
the
princess
the
parents
heard
approvingly
and
the
king
promised
to
furnish
a
ship
in
which
his
guest
might
return
to
his
own
land
the
next
day
the
assembled
chiefs
confirmed
the
promise
of
the
king
a
bark
was
prepared
and
a
crew
of
stout
rowers
selected
and
all
betook
themselves
to
the
palace
where
a
bounteous
repast
was
provided
after
the
feast
the
king
proposed
that
the
young
men
should
show
their
guest
their
proficiency
in
manly
sports
and
all
went
forth
to
the
arena
for
games
of
running
wrestling
and
other
exercises
after
all
had
done
their
best
ulysses
being
challenged
to
show
what
he
could
do
at
first
declined
but
being
taunted
by
one
of
the
youths
seized
a
quoit
of
weight
far
heavier
than
any
of
the
phaeacians
had
thrown
and
sent
it
farther
than
the
utmost
throw
of
theirs
all
were
astonished
and
viewed
their
guest
with
greatly
increased
respect
after
the
games
they
returned
to
the
hall
and
the
herald
led
in
demodocus
the
blind
bard
dear
to
the
muse
who
yet
appointed
him
both
good
and
ill
took
from
him
sight
but
gave
him
strains
divine
he
took
for
his
theme
the
wooden
horse
by
means
of
which
the
greeks
found
entrance
into
troy
apollo
inspired
him
and
he
sang
so
feelingly
the
terrors
and
the
exploits
of
that
eventful
time
that
all
were
delighted
but
ulysses
was
moved
to
tears
observing
which
alcinous
when
the
song
was
done
demanded
of
him
why
at
the
mention
of
troy
his
sorrows
awaked
had
he
lost
there
a
father
or
brother
or
any
dear
friend
ulysses
replied
by
announcing
himself
by
his
true
name
and
at
their
request
recounted
the
adventures
which
had
befallen
him
since
his
departure
from
troy
this
narrative
raised
the
sympathy
and
admiration
of
the
phaeacians
for
their
guest
to
the
highest
pitch
the
king
proposed
that
all
the
chiefs
should
present
him
with
a
gift
himself
setting
the
example
they
obeyed
and
vied
with
one
another
in
loading
the
illustrious
stranger
with
costly
gifts
the
next
day
ulysses
set
sail
in
the
phaeacian
vessel
and
in
a
short
time
arrived
safe
at
ithaca
his
own
island
when
the
vessel
touched
the
strand
he
was
asleep
the
mariners
without
waking
him
carried
him
on
shore
and
landed
with
him
the
chest
containing
his
presents
and
then
sailed
away
neptune
was
so
displeased
at
the
conduct
of
the
phaeacians
in
thus
rescuing
ulysses
from
his
hands
that
on
the
return
of
the
vessel
to
port
he
transformed
it
into
a
rock
right
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
harbor

fate
of
the
suitors
ulysses
had
now
been
away
from
ithaca
for
twenty
years
and
when
he
awoke
he
did
not
recognize
his
native
land
minerva
appeared
to
him
in
the
form
of
a
young
shepherd
informed
him
where
he
was
and
told
him
the
state
of
things
at
his
palace
more
than
a
hundred
nobles
of
ithaca
and
of
the
neighboring
islands
had
been
for
years
suing
for
the
hand
of
penelope
his
wife
imagining
him
dead
and
lording
it
over
his
palace
and
people
as
if
they
were
owners
of
both
that
he
might
be
able
to
take
vengeance
upon
them
it
was
important
that
he
should
not
be
recognized
minerva
accordingly
metamorphosed
him
into
an
unsightly
beggar
and
as
such
he
was
kindly
received
by
eumaeus
the
a
faithful
servant
of
his
house
telemachus
his
son
was
absent
in
quest
of
his
father
he
had
gone
to
the
courts
of
the
other
kings
who
had
returned
from
the
trojan
expedition
while
on
the
search
he
received
counsel
from
minerva
to
return
home
he
arrived
and
sought
eumaeus
to
learn
something
of
the
state
of
affairs
at
the
palace
before
presenting
himself
among
the
suitors
finding
a
stranger
with
eumaeus
he
treated
him
courteously
though
in
the
garb
of
a
beggar
and
promised
him
assistance
eumaeus
was
sent
to
the
palace
to
inform
penelope
privately
of
her
son
arrival
for
caution
was
necessary
with
regard
to
the
suitors
who
as
telemachus
had
learned
were
plotting
to
intercept
and
kill
him
when
eumaeus
was
gone
minerva
presented
herself
to
ulysses
and
directed
him
to
make
himself
known
to
his
son
at
the
same
time
she
touched
him
removed
at
once
from
him
the
appearance
of
age
and
penury
and
gave
him
the
aspect
of
vigorous
manhood
that
belonged
to
him
telemachus
viewed
him
with
astonishment
and
at
first
thought
he
must
be
more
than
mortal
but
ulysses
announced
himself
as
his
father
and
accounted
for
the
change
of
appearance
by
explaining
that
it
was
doing
then
threw
telemachus
his
arms
around
his
father
neck
and
wept
desire
intense
of
lamentation
seized
on
both
soft
murmurs
uttering
each
indulged
his
grief
the
father
and
son
took
counsel
together
how
they
should
get
the
better
of
the
suitors
and
punish
them
for
their
outrages
it
was
arranged
that
telemachus
should
proceed
to
the
palace
and
mingle
with
the
suitors
as
formerly
that
ulysses
should
also
go
as
a
beggar
a
character
which
in
the
rude
old
times
had
different
privileges
from
what
we
concede
to
it
now
as
traveller
and
storyteller
the
beggar
was
admitted
in
the
halls
of
chieftains
and
often
treated
like
a
guest
though
sometimes
also
no
doubt
with
contumely
ulysses
charged
his
son
not
to
betray
by
any
display
of
unusual
interest
in
him
that
he
knew
him
to
be
other
than
he
seemed
and
even
if
he
saw
him
insulted
or
beaten
not
to
interpose
otherwise
than
he
might
do
for
any
stranger
at
the
palace
they
found
the
usual
scene
of
feasting
and
riot
going
on
the
suitors
pretended
to
receive
telemachus
with
joy
at
his
return
though
secretly
mortified
at
the
failure
of
their
plots
to
take
his
life
the
old
beggar
was
permitted
to
enter
and
provided
with
a
portion
from
the
table
a
touching
incident
occurred
as
ulysses
entered
the
courtyard
of
the
palace
an
old
dog
lay
in
the
yard
almost
dead
with
age
and
seeing
a
stranger
enter
raised
his
head
with
ears
erect
it
was
argus
ulysses
own
dog
that
he
had
in
other
days
often
led
to
the
chase
soon
as
he
perceived
ulysses
nigh
down
fell
his
ears
clapped
close
and
with
his
tail
glad
sign
he
gave
of
gratulation
impotent
to
rise
and
to
approach
his
master
as
of
old
ulysses
noting
him
wiped
off
a
tear
unmarked
then
his
destiny
released
old
argus
soon
as
he
had
lived
to
see
ulysses
in
the
twentieth
year
restored
as
ulysses
sat
eating
his
portion
in
the
hall
the
suitors
began
to
exhibit
their
insolence
to
him
when
he
mildly
remonstrated
one
of
them
raised
a
stool
and
with
it
gave
him
a
blow
telemachus
had
hard
work
to
restrain
his
indignation
at
seeing
his
father
so
treated
in
his
own
hall
but
remembering
his
injunctions
said
no
more
than
what
became
him
as
master
of
the
house
though
young
and
protector
of
his
guests
penelope
had
protracted
her
decision
in
favor
of
either
of
her
suitors
so
long
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
further
pretence
for
delay
the
continued
absence
of
her
husband
seemed
to
prove
that
his
return
was
no
longer
to
be
expected
meanwhile
her
son
had
grown
up
and
was
able
to
manage
his
own
affairs
she
therefore
consented
to
submit
the
question
of
her
choice
to
a
trial
of
skill
among
the
suitors
the
test
selected
was
shooting
with
the
bow
twelve
rings
were
arranged
in
a
line
and
he
whose
arrow
was
sent
through
the
whole
twelve
was
to
have
the
queen
for
his
prize
a
bow
that
one
of
his
brother
heroes
had
given
to
ulysses
in
former
times
was
brought
from
the
armory
and
with
its
quiver
full
of
arrows
was
laid
in
the
hall
telemachus
had
taken
care
that
all
other
weapons
should
be
removed
under
pretence
that
in
the
heat
of
competition
there
was
danger
in
some
rash
moment
of
putting
them
to
an
improper
use
all
things
being
prepared
for
the
trial
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
bend
the
bow
in
order
to
attach
the
string
telemachus
endeavored
to
do
it
but
found
all
his
efforts
fruitless
and
modestly
confessing
that
he
had
attempted
a
task
beyond
his
strength
he
yielded
the
bow
to
another
he
tried
it
with
no
better
success
and
amidst
the
laughter
and
jeers
of
his
companions
gave
it
up
another
tried
it
and
another
they
rubbed
the
bow
with
tallow
but
all
to
no
purpose
it
would
not
bend
then
spoke
ulysses
humbly
suggesting
that
he
should
be
permitted
to
try
for
said
he
beggar
as
i
am
i
was
once
a
soldier
and
there
is
still
some
strength
in
these
old
limbs
of
mine
the
suitors
hooted
with
derision
and
commanded
to
turn
him
out
of
the
hall
for
his
insolence
but
telemachus
spoke
up
for
him
and
merely
to
gratify
the
old
man
bade
him
try
ulysses
took
the
bow
and
handled
it
with
the
hand
of
a
master
with
ease
he
adjusted
the
cord
to
its
notch
then
fitting
an
arrow
to
the
bow
he
drew
the
string
and
sped
the
arrow
unerring
through
the
rings
without
allowing
them
time
to
express
their
astonishment
he
said
now
for
another
mark
and
aimed
direct
at
the
most
insolent
one
of
the
suitors
the
arrow
pierced
through
his
throat
and
he
fell
dead
telemachus
eumaeus
and
another
faithful
follower
well
armed
now
sprang
to
the
side
of
ulysses
the
suitors
in
amazement
looked
round
for
arms
but
found
none
neither
was
there
any
way
of
escape
for
eumaeus
had
secured
the
door
ulysses
left
them
not
long
in
uncertainty
he
announced
himself
as
the
chief
whose
house
they
had
invaded
whose
substance
they
had
squandered
whose
wife
and
son
they
had
persecuted
for
ten
long
years
and
told
them
he
meant
to
have
ample
vengeance
all
were
slain
and

left
master
of

possessor
of

and
lost
on
arriving
at
the
place
of
rendezvous
numerous
fugitives
of
both
sexes
were
found
who
put
themselves
under
the
guidance
of
aeneas
some
months
were
spent
in
preparation
and
at
length
they
embarked
they
first
landed
on
the
neighboring
shores
of
thrace
and
were
preparing
to
build
a
city
but
aeneas
was
deterred
by
a
prodigy
preparing
to
offer
sacrifice
he
tore
some
twigs
from
one
of
the
bushes
to
his
dismay
the
wounded
part
dropped
blood
when
he
repeated
the
act
a
voice
from
the
ground
cried
out
to
him
spare
me
aeneas
i
am
your
kinsman
polydore
here
murdered
with
many
arrows
from
which
a
bush
has
grown
nourished
with
my
blood
these
words
recalled
to
the
recollection
of
aeneas
that
polydore
was
a
young
prince
of
troy
whom
his
father
had
sent
with
ample
treasures
to
the
neighboring
land
of
thrace
to
be
there
brought
up
at
a
distance
from
the
horrors
of
war
the
king
to
whom
he
was
sent
had
murdered
him
and
seized
his
treasures
aeneas
and
his
companions
considering
the
land
accursed
by
the
stain
of
such
a
crime
hastened
away
they
next
landed
on
the
island
of
delos
which
was
once
a
floating
island
till
jupiter
fastened
it
by
adamantine
chains
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
apollo
and
diana
were
born
there
and
the
island
was
sacred
to
apollo
here
aeneas
consulted
the
oracle
of
apollo
and
received
an
answer
ambiguous
as
usual
seek
your
ancient
mother
there
the
race
of
aeneas
shall
dwell
and
reduce
all
other
nations
to
their
sway
the
trojans
heard
with
joy
and
immediately
began
to
ask
one
another
where
is
the
spot
intended
by
the
oracle
anchises
remembered
that
there
was
a
tradition
that
their
forefathers
came
from
crete
and
thither
they
resolved
to
steer
they
arrived
at
crete
and
began
to
build
their
city
but
sickness
broke
out
among
them
and
the
fields
that
they
had
planted
failed
to
yield
a
crop
in
this
gloomy
aspect
of
affairs
aeneas
was
warned
in
a
dream
to
leave
the
country
and
seek
a
western
land
called
hesperia
whence
dardanus
the
true
founder
of
the
trojan
race
had
originally
migrated
to
hesperia
now
called
italy
therefore
they
directed
their
future
course
and
not
till
after
many
adventures
and
the
lapse
of
time
sufficient
to
carry
a
modern
navigator
several
times
round
the
world
did
they
arrive
there
their
first
landing
was
at
the
island
of
the
harpies
these
were
disgusting
birds
with
the
heads
of
maidens
with
long
claws
and
faces
pale
with
hunger
they
were
sent
by
the
gods
to
torment
a
certain
phineus
whom
jupiter
had
deprived
of
his
sight
in
punishment
of
his
cruelty
and
whenever
a
meal
was
placed
before
him
the
harpies
darted
down
from
the
air
and
carried
it
off
they
were
driven
away
from
phineus
by
the
heroes
of
the
argonautic
expedition
and
took
refuge
in
the
island
where
aeneas
now
found
them
when
they
entered
the
port
the
trojans
saw
herds
of
cattle
roaming
over
the
plain
they
slew
as
many
as
they
wished
and
prepared
for
a
feast
but
no
sooner
had
they
seated
themselves
at
the
table
than
a
horrible
clamor
was
heard
in
the
air
and
a
flock
of
these
odious
harpies
came
rushing
down
upon
them
seizing
in
their
talons
the
meat
from
the
dishes
and
flying
away
with
it
aeneas
and
his
companions
drew
their
swords
and
dealt
vigorous
blows
among
the
monsters
but
to
no
purpose
for
they
were
so
nimble
it
was
almost
impossible
to
hit
them
and
their
feathers
were
like
armor
impenetrable
to
steel
one
of
them
perched
on
a
neighboring
cliff
screamed
out
is
it
thus
trojans
you
treat
us
innocent
birds
first
slaughter
our
cattle
and
then
make
war
on
ourselves
she
then
predicted
dire
sufferings
to
them
in
their
future
course
and
having
vented
her
wrath
flew
away
the
trojans
made
haste
to
leave
the
country
and
next
found
themselves
coasting
along
the
shore
of
epirus
here
they
landed
and
to
their
astonishment
learned
that
certain
trojan
exiles
who
had
been
carried
there
as
prisoners
had
become
rulers
of
the
country

widow

treated
the
exiles
with
the
utmost
hospitality
and
dismissed
them
loaded
with
gifts
from
hence
aeneas
coasted
along
the
shore
of
sicily
and
passed
the
country
of
the
cyclopes
here
they
were
hailed
from
the
shore
by
a
miserable
object
whom
by
his
garments
tattered
as
they
were
they
perceived
to
be
a
greek
he
told
them
he
was
one
of

left
behind
by
that
chief
in
his
hurried
departure
he
related
the
story
of
ulysses

with

and
besought
them
to
take
him
off
with
them
as
he
had
no

of
sustaining
his
existence
where
he
was
but
wild
berries
and
roots
and
lived
in
constant
fear
of
the
cyclopes

his

waded

to
advance

into

that

in

took
to

present
a
view
of
the
regions
of
the
dead
depicted
by
one
of
their
most
enlightened
poets
who
drew
his
doctrines
from
their
most
esteemed
philosophers
the
region
where
virgil
locates
the
entrance
to
this
abode
is
perhaps
the
most
strikingly
adapted
to
excite
ideas
of
the
terrific
and
preternatural
of
any
on
the
face
of
the
earth
it
is
the
volcanic
region
near
vesuvius
where
the
whole
country
is
cleft
with
chasms
from
which
sulphurous
flames
arise
while
the
ground
is
shaken
with
vapors
and
mysterious
sounds
issue
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
the
lake
avernus
is
supposed
to
fill
the
crater
of
an
extinct
volcano
it
is
circular
half
a
mile
wide
and
very
deep
surrounded
by
high
banks
which
in
virgil
time
were
covered
with
a
gloomy
forest
mephitic
vapors
rise
from
its
waters
so
that
no
life
is
found
on
its
banks
and
no
birds
fly
over
it
here
according
to
the
poet
was
the
cave
which
afforded
access
to
the
infernal
regions
and
here
aeneas
offered
sacrifices
to
the
infernal
deities
proserpine
hecate
and
the
furies
then
a
roaring
was
heard
in
the
earth
the
woods
on
the
were
shaken
and
the
howling
of
dogs
announced
the
approach
of
the
deities
now
said
the
sibyl
summon
up
your
courage
for
you
will
need
it
she
descended
into
the
cave
and
aeneas
followed
before
the
threshold
of
hell
they
passed
through
a
group
of
beings
who
are
enumerated
as
griefs
and
avenging
cares
pale
diseases
and
melancholy
age
fear
and
hunger
that
tempt
to
crime
toil
poverty
and
death
forms
horrible
to
view
the
furies
spread
their
couches
there
and
discord
whose
hair
was
of
vipers
tied
up
with
a
bloody
fillet
here
also
were
the
monsters
briareus
with
his
hundred
arms
hydras
hissing
and
chimaeras
breathing
fire
aeneas
shuddered
at
the
sight
drew
his
sword
and
would
have
struck
but
the
sibyl
restrained
him
they
then
came
to
the
black
river
cocytus
where
they
found
the
ferryman
charon
old
and
squalid
but
strong
and
vigorous
who
was
receiving
passengers
of
all
kinds
into
his
boat
magnanimous
heroes
boys
and
unmarried
girls
as
numerous
as
the
leaves
that
fall
at
autumn
or
the
flocks
that
fly
southward
at
the
approach
of
winter
they
stood
pressing
for
a
passage
and
longing
to
touch
the
opposite
shore
but
the
stern
ferryman
took
in
only
such
as
he
chose
driving
the
rest
back
aeneas
wondering
at
the
sight
asked
the
sibyl
why
this
discrimination
she
answered
those
who
are
taken
on
board
the
bark
are
the
souls
of
those
who
have
received
due
burial
rites
the
host
of
others
who
have
remained
unburied
are
not
permitted
to
pass
the
flood
but
wander
a
hundred
years
and
flit
to
and
fro
about
the
shore
till
at
last
they
are
taken
over
aeneas
grieved
at
recollecting
some
of
his
own
companions
who
had
perished
in
the
storm
at
that
moment
he
beheld
palinurus
his
pilot
who
fell
overboard
and
was
drowned
he
addressed
him
and
asked
him
the
cause
of
his
misfortune
palinurus
replied
that
the
rudder
was
carried
away
and
he
clinging
to
it
was
swept
away
with
it
he
besought
aeneas
most
urgently
to
extend
to
him
his
hand
and
take
him
in
company
to
the
opposite
shore
but
the
sibyl
rebuked
him
for
the
wish
thus
to
transgress
the
laws
of
pluto
but
consoled
him
by
informing
him
that
the
people
of
the
shore
where
his
body
had
been
wafted
by
the
waves
should
be
stirred
up
by
prodigies
to
give
it
due
burial
and
that
the
promontory
should
bear
the
name
of
cape
palinurus
which
it
does
to
this
day
leaving
palinurus
consoled
by
these
words
they
approached
the
boat
charon
fixing
his
eyes
sternly
upon
the
advancing
warrior
demanded
by
what
right
he
living
and
armed
approached
that
shore
to
which
the
sibyl
replied
that
they
would
commit
no
violence
that
aeneas
only
object
was
to
see
his
father
and
finally
exhibited
the
golden
branch
at
sight
of
which
wrath
relaxed
and
he
made
haste
to
turn
his
bark
to
the
shore
and
receive
them
on
board
the
boat
adapted
only
to
the
light
freight
of
bodiless
spirits
groaned
under
the
weight
of
the
hero
they
were
soon
conveyed
to
the
opposite
shore
there
they
were
encountered
by
the
dog
cerberus
with
his
necks
bristling
with
snakes
he
barked
with
all
his
three
throats
till
the
sibyl
threw
him
a
medicated
cake
which
he
eagerly
devoured
and
then
stretched
himself
out
in
his
den
and
fell
asleep
aeneas
and
the
sibyl
sprang
to
land
the
first
sound
that
struck
their
ears
was
the
wailing
of
young
children
who
had
died
on
the
threshold
of
life
and
near
to
these
were
they
who
had
perished
under
false
charges
minos
presides
over
them
as
judge
and
examines
the
deeds
of
each
the
next
class
was
of
those
who
had
died
by
their
own
hand
hating
life
and
seeking
refuge
in
death
o
how
willingly
would
they
now
endure
poverty
labor
and
any
other
infliction
if
they
might
but
return
to
life
next
were
situated
the
regions
of
sadness
divided
off
into
retired
paths
leading
through
groves
of
myrtle
here
roamed
those
who
had
fallen
victims
to
unrequited
love
not
freed
from
pain
even
by
death
itself
among
these
aeneas
thought
he
descried
the
form
of
dido
with
a
wound
still
recent
in
the
dim
light
he
was
for
a
moment
uncertain
but
approaching
perceived
it
was
indeed
herself
tears
fell
from
his
eyes
and
he
addressed
her
in
the
accents
of
love
unhappy
dido
was
then
the
rumor
true
that
you
had
perished
and
was
i
alas
the
cause
i
call
the
gods
to
witness
that
my
departure
from
you
was
reluctant
and
in
obedience
to
the
commands
of
jove
nor
could
i
believe
that
my
absence
would
cost
you
so
dear
stop
i
beseech
you
and
refuse
me
not
a
last
farewell
she
stood
for
a
moment
with
averted
countenance
and
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
and
then
silently
passed
on
as
insensible
to
his
pleadings
as
a
rock
aeneas
followed
for
some
distance
then
with
a
heavy
heart
rejoined
his
companion
and
resumed
his
route
they
next
entered
the
fields
where
roam
the
heroes
who
have
fallen
in
battle
here
they
saw
many
shades
of
grecian
and
trojan
warriors
the
trojans
thronged
around
him
and
could
not
be
satisfied
with
the
sight
they
asked
the
cause
of
his
coming
and
plied
him
with
innumerable
questions
but
the
greeks
at
the
sight
of
his
armor
glittering
through
the
murky
atmosphere
recognized
the
hero
and
filled
with
terror
turned
their
backs
and
fled
as
they
used
to
do
on
the
plains
of
troy
aeneas
would
have
lingered
long
with
his
trojan
friends
but
the
sibyl
hurried
him
away
they
next
came
to
a
place
where
the
road
divided
the
one
leading
to
elysium
the
other
to
the
regions
of
the
condemned
aeneas
beheld
on
one
side
the
walls
of
a
mighty
city
around
which
phlegethon
rolled
its
fiery
waters
before
him
was
the
gate
of
adamant
that
neither
gods
nor
men
can
break
through
an
iron
tower
stood
by
the
gate
on
which
tisiphone
the
avenging
fury
kept
guard
from
the
city
were
heard
groans
and
the
sound
of
the
scourge
the
creaking
of
iron
and
the
clanking
of
chains
aeneas
inquired
of
his
guide
what
crimes
were
those
whose
punishments
produced
the
sounds
he
heard
the
sibyl
answered
here
is
the
judgment
hall
of
rhadamanthus
who
brings
to
light
crimes
done
in
life
which
the
perpetrator
vainly
thought
impenetrably
hid
tisiphone
applies
her
whip
of
scorpions
and
delivers
the
offender
over
to
her
sister
furies
at
this
moment
with
horrid
clang
the
brazen
gates
unfolded
and
aeneas
saw
within
a
hydra
with
fifty
heads
guarding
the
entrance
the
sibyl
told
him
that
the
gulf
of
tartarus
descended
deep
so
that
its
recesses
were
as
far
beneath
their
feet
as
heaven
was
high
above
their
heads
in
the
bottom
of
this
pit
the
titan
race
who
warred
against
the
gods
lie
prostrate
salmoneus
also
who
presumed
to
vie
with
jupiter
and
built
a
bridge
of
brass
over
which
he
drove
his
chariot
that
the
sound
might
resemble
thunder
launching
flaming
brands
at
his
people
in
imitation
of
lightning
till
jupiter
struck
him
with
a
real
thunderbolt
and
taught
him
the
difference
between
mortal
weapons
and
divine
here
also
is
tityus
the
giant
whose
form
is
so
immense
that
as
he
lies
he
stretches
over
nine
acres
while
a
vulture
preys
upon
his
liver
which
as
fast
as
it
is
devoured
grows
again
so
that
his
punishment
will
have
no
end
aeneas
saw
groups
seated
at
tables
loaded
with
dainties
while
near
by
stood
a
fury
who
snatched
away
the
viands
from
their
lips
as
fast
as
they
prepared
to
taste
them
others
beheld
suspended
over
their
heads
huge
rocks
threatening
to
fall
keeping
them
in
a
state
of
constant
alarm
these
were
they
who
had
hated
their
brothers
or
struck
their
parents
or
defrauded
the
friends
who
trusted
them
or
who
having
grown
rich
kept
their
money
to
themselves
and
gave
no
share
to
others
the
last
being
the
most
numerous
class
here
also
were
those
who
had
violated
the
marriage
vow
or
fought
in
a
bad
cause
or
failed
in
fidelity
to
their
employers
here
was
one
who
had
sold
his
country
for
gold
another
who
perverted
the
laws
making
them
say
one
thing
and
another
ixion
was
there
fastened
to
the
circumference
of
a
wheel
ceaselessly
revolving
and
sisyphus
whose
task
was
to
roll
a
huge
stone
up
to
a
but
when
the
steep
was
gained
the
rock
repulsed
by
some
sudden
force
rushed
again
headlong
down
to
the
plain
again
he
toiled
at
it
while
the
sweat
bathed
all
his
weary
limbs
but
all
to
no
effect
there
was
tantalus
who
stood
in
a
pool
his
chin
level
with
the
water
yet
he
was
parched
with
thirst
and
found
nothing
to
assuage
it
for
when
he
bowed
his
hoary
head
eager
to
quaff
the
water
fled
away
leaving
the
ground
at
his
feet
all
dry
tall
trees
laden
with
fruit
stooped
their
heads
to
him
pears
pomegranates
apples
and
luscious
figs
but
when
with
a
sudden
grasp
he
tried
to
seize
them
winds
whirled
them
high
above
his
reach
the
sibyl
now
warned
aeneas
that
it
was
time
to
turn
from
these
melancholy
regions
and
seek
the
city
of
the
blessed
they
passed
through
a
middle
tract
of
darkness
and
came
upon
the
elysian
fields
the
groves
where
the
happy
reside
they
breathed
a
freer
air
and
saw
all
objects
clothed
in
a
purple
light
the
region
has
a
sun
and
stars
of
its
own
the
inhabitants
were
enjoying
themselves
in
various
ways
some
in
sports
on
the
grassy
turf
in
games
of
strength
or
skill
others
dancing
or
singing
orpheus
struck
the
chords
of
his
lyre
and
called
forth
ravishing
sounds
here
aeneas
saw
the
founders
of
the
trojan
state
magnanimous
heroes
who
lived
in
happier
times
he
gazed
with
admiration
on
the
war
chariots
and
glittering
arms
now
reposing
in
disuse
spears
stood
fixed
in
the
ground
and
the
horses
unharnessed
roamed
over
the
plain
the
same
pride
in
splendid
armor
and
generous
steeds
which
the
old
heroes
felt
in
life
accompanied
them
here
he
saw
another
group
feasting
and
listening
to
the
strains
of
music
they
were
in
a
laurel
grove
whence
the
great
river
po
has
its
origin
and
flows
out
among
men
here
dwelt
those
who
fell
by
wounds
received
in
their
country
cause
holy
priests
also
and
poets
who
have
uttered
thoughts
worthy
of
apollo
and
others
who
have
contributed
to
cheer
and
adorn
life
by
their
discoveries
in
the
useful
arts
and
have
made
their
memory
blessed
by
rendering
service
to
mankind
they
wore
fillets
about
their
brows
the
sibyl
addressed
a
group
of
these
and
inquired
where
anchises
was
to
be
found
they
were
directed
where
to
seek
him
and
soon
found
him
in
a
verdant
valley
where
he
was
contemplating
the
ranks
of
his
posterity
their
destinies
and
worthy
deeds
to
be
achieved
in
coming
times
when
he
recognized
aeneas
approaching
he
stretched
out
both
hands
to
him
while
tears
flowed
freely
have
you
come
at
last
said
he
long
expected
and
do
i
behold
you
after
such
perils
past
o
my
son
how
have
i
trembled
for
you
as
i
have
watched
your
career
to
which
aeneas
replied
o
father
your
image
was
always
before
me
to
guide
and
guard
me
then
he
endeavored
to
enfold
his
father
in
his
embrace
but
his
arms
enclosed
only
an
unsubstantial
image
aeneas
perceived
before
him
a
spacious
valley
with
trees
gently
waving
to
the
wind
a
tranquil
landscape
through
which
the
river
lethe
flowed
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
wandered
a
countless
multitude
numerous
as
insects
in
the
summer
air
aeneas
with
surprise
inquired
who
were
these
anchises
answered
they
are
souls
to
which
bodies
are
to
be
given
in
due
time
meanwhile
they
dwell
on
lethe
bank
and
drink
oblivion
of
their
former
lives
o
father
said
aeneas
is
it
possible
that
any
can
be
so
in
love
with
life
as
to
wish
to
leave
these
tranquil
seats
for
the
upper
world
anchises
replied
by
explaining
the
plan
of
creation
the
creator
he
told
him
originally
made
the
material
of
which
souls
are
composed
of
the
four
elements
fire
air
earth
and
water
all
which
when
united
took
the
form
of
the
most
excellent
part
fire
and
became
flame
this
material
was
scattered
like
seed
among
the
heavenly
bodies
the
sun
moon
and
stars
of
this
seed
the
inferior
gods
created
man
and
all
other
animals
mingling
it
with
various
proportions
of
earth
by
which
its
purity
was
alloyed
and
reduced
thus
the
more
earth
predominates
in
the
composition
the
less
pure
is
the
individual
and
we
see
men
and
women
with
their
bodies
have
not
the
purity
of
childhood
so
in
proportion
to
the
time
which
the
union
of
body
and
soul
has
lasted
is
the
impurity
contracted
by
the
spiritual
part
this
impurity
must
be
purged
away
after
death
which
is
done
by
ventilating
the
souls
in
the
current
of
winds
or
merging
them
in
water
or
burning
out
their
impurities
by
fire
some
few
of
whom
anchises
intimates
that
he
is
one
are
admitted
at
once
to
elysium
there
to
remain
but
the
rest
after
the
impurities
of
earth
are
purged
away
are
sent
back
to
life
endowed
with
new
bodies
having
had
the
remembrance
of
their
former
lives
effectually
washed
away
by
the
waters
of
lethe
some
however
there
still
are
so
thoroughly
corrupted
that
they
are
not
fit
to
be
intrusted
with
human
bodies
and
these
are
made
into
brute
animals
lions
tigers
cats
dogs
monkeys
etc
this
is
what
the
ancients
called
metempsychosis
or
the
transmigration
of
souls
a
doctrine
which
is
still
held
by
the
natives
of
india
who
scruple
to
destroy
the
life
even
of
the
most
insignificant
animal
not
knowing
but
it
may
be
one
of
their
relations
in
an
altered
form
anchises
having
explained
so
much
proceeded
to
point
out
to
aeneas
individuals
of
his
race
who
were
hereafter
to
be
born
and
to
relate
to
him
the
exploits
they
should
perform
in
the
world
after
this
he
reverted
to
the
present
and
told
his
son
of
the
events
that
remained
to
him
to
be
accomplished
before
the
complete
establishment
of
himself
and
his
followers
in
italy
wars
were
to
be
waged
battles
fought
a
bride
to
be
won
and
in
the
result
a
trojan
state
founded
from
which
should
rise
the
roman
power
to
be
in
time
the
sovereign
of
the
world
aeneas
and
the
sibyl
then
took
leave
of
anchises
and
returned
by
some
short
cut
which

forms
no

places
it
on

describes
it
as
a

there
is

this

may
have

the
sibyl
as

and
the
sibyl
pursued
their
way
back
to
earth
he
said
to
her
whether
thou
be
a

beloved
of
the

by
me
thou
shalt
always
be
held
in

i
will
cause
a

to
be
built
to
thy
honor
and
will
myself
bring
offerings
i
am
no
goddess
said
the
sibyl
i
have
no
claim
to
sacrifice
or
offering
i
am
mortal
yet
if
i
could
have
accepted
the
love
of
apollo
i
might
have
been
immortal
he
promised
me
the
fulfilment
of
my
wish
if
i
would
consent
to
be
his
i
took
a
handful
of
sand
and
holding
it
forth
said
me
to
see
as
many
birthdays
as
there
are
sand
grains
in

hand
unluckily
i
forgot
to
ask
for
enduring
youth
this
also
he
would
have
granted
could
i
have
accepted
his
love
but
offended
at
my
refusal
he
allowed
me
to
grow

my
youth
and
youthful
strength
fled
long

i
have
lived
seven
hundred
years
and
to
equal
the
number
of
the

grains
i
have
still
to
see
three
hundred
springs
and
three
hundred

my
body
shrinks
up
as
years
increase
and
in

i
shall
be
lost

but
my

will
remain

future
ages
will
respect
my
sayings
these
concluding
words
of
the
sibyl
alluded
to
her
prophetic
power
in
her
cave
she
was
accustomed
to
inscribe
on
leaves
gathered
from
the
trees
the
names
and
fates
of
individuals
the
leaves
thus
inscribed
were
arranged
in
order
within
the
cave
and
might
be
consulted
by
her
votaries
but
if
perchance
at
the
opening
of
the
door
the
wind
rushed
in
and
dispersed
the
leaves
the
sibyl
gave
no
aid
to
restoring
them
again
and
the
oracle
was
irreparably
lost
the
following
legend
of
the
sibyl
is
fixed
at
a
later
date
in
the
reign
of
one
of
the
tarquins
there
appeared
before
the
king
a
woman
who
offered
him
nine
books
for
sale
the
king
refused
to
purchase
them
whereupon
the
woman
went
away
and
burned
three
of
the
books
and
returning
offered
the
remaining
books
for
the
same
price
she
had
asked
for
the
nine
the
king
again
rejected
them
but
when
the
woman
after
burning
three
books
more
returned
and
asked
for
the
three
remaining
the
same
price
which
she
had
before
asked
for
the
nine
his
curiosity
was
excited
and
he
purchased
the
books
they
were
found
to
contain
the
destinies
of
the
roman
state
they
were
kept
in
the
temple
of
jupiter
capitolinus
preserved
in
a
stone
chest
and
allowed
to
be
inspected
only
by
especial
officers
appointed
for
that
duty
who
on
great
occasions
consulted
them
and
interpreted
their
oracles
to
the
people
there
were
various
sibyls
but
the
cumaean
sibyl
of
whom
ovid
and
virgil
write
is
the
most
celebrated
of
them
ovid
story
of
her
life
protracted
to
one
thousand
years
may
be
intended
to
represent
the
various
sibyls
as
being
only
reappearances
of
one
and
the
same
individual
young
in
the
night
thoughts
alludes
to
the
sibyl
speaking
of
worldly
wisdom
he
says
if
future
fate
she
plans
is
all
in
leaves
like
sibyl
unsubstantial
fleeting
bliss
at
the
first
blast
it
vanishes

parted
from

sibyl
and
rejoined
his
fleet
coasted
along
the
shores
of
italy
and
cast
anchor
in
the
mouth
of
the
tiber
the
poet
having
brought
his
hero
to
this
spot
the
destined
termination
of
his
wanderings
invokes
his
muse
to
tell
him
the
situation
of
things
at
that
eventful
moment
latinus
third
in
descent
from
saturn
ruled
the
country
he
was
now
old
and
had
no
male
descendant
but
had
one
charming
daughter
lavinia
who
was
sought
in
marriage
by
many
neighboring
chiefs
one
of
whom
turnus
king
of
the
rutulians
was
favored
by
the
wishes
of
her
parents
but
latinus
had
been
warned
in
a
dream
by
his
father
faunus
that
the
destined
husband
of
lavinia
should
come
from
a
foreign
land
from
that
union
should
spring
a
race
destined
to
subdue
the
world
our
readers
will
remember
that
in
the
conflict
with
the
harpies
one
of
those
birds
had
threatened
the
trojans
with
dire
sufferings
in
particular
she
predicted
that
before
their
wanderings
ceased
they
should
be
pressed
by
hunger
to
devour
their
tables
this
portent
now
came
true
for
as
they
took
their
scanty
meal
seated
on
the
grass
the
men
placed
their
hard
biscuit
on
their
laps
and
put
thereon
whatever
their
gleanings
in
the
woods
supplied
having
despatched
the
latter
they
finished
by
eating
the
crusts
seeing
which
the
boy
iulus
said
playfully
see
we
are
eating
our
tables
aeneas
caught
the
words
and
accepted
the
omen
all
hail
promised
land
he
exclaimed
this
is
our
home
this
our
country
he
then
took
measures
to
find
out
who
were
the
present
inhabitants
of
the
land
and
who
their
rulers
a
hundred
chosen
men
were
sent
to
the
village
of
latinus
bearing
presents
and
a
request
for
friendship
and
alliance
they
went
and
were
favorably
received
latinus
immediately
concluded
that
the
trojan
hero
was
no
other
than
the
promised
announced
by
the
oracle
he
cheerfully
granted
his
alliance
and
sent
back
the
messengers
mounted
on
steeds
from
his
stables
and
loaded
with
gifts
and
friendly
messages
juno
seeing
things
go
thus
prosperously
for
the
trojans
felt
her
old
animosity
revive
summoned
alecto
from
erebus
and
sent
her
to
stir
up
discord
the
fury
first
took
possession
of
the
queen
amata
and
roused
her
to
oppose
in
every
way
the
new
alliance
alecto
then
speeded
to
the
city
of
turnus
and
assuming
the
form
of
an
old
priestess
informed
him
of
the
arrival
of
the
foreigners
and
of
the
attempts
of
their
prince
to
rob
him
of
his
bride
next
she
turned
her
attention
to
the
camp
of
the
trojans
there
she
saw
the
boy
iulus
and
his
companions
amusing
themselves
with
hunting
she
sharpened
the
scent
of
the
dogs
and
led
them
to
rouse
up
from
the
thicket
a
tame
stag
the
favorite
of
silvia
the
daughter
of
tyrrheus
the
king
herdsman
a
javelin
from
the
hand
of
iulus
wounded
the
animal
and
he
had
only
strength
left
to
run
homewards
and
died
at
his
mistress
feet
her
cries
and
tears
roused
her
brothers
and
the
herdsmen
and
they
seizing
whatever
weapons
came
to
hand
furiously
assaulted
the
hunting
party
these
were
protected
by
their
friends
and
the
herdsmen
were
finally
driven
back
with
the
loss
of
two
of
their
number
these
things
were
enough
to
rouse
the
storm
of
war
and
the
queen
turnus
and
the
peasants
all
urged
the
old
king
to
drive
the
strangers
from
the
country
he
resisted
as
long
as
he
could
but
finding
his
opposition
unavailing
finally
gave
way
and
retreated
to
his
retirement
opening
the
gates
of
janus
it
was
the
custom
of
the
country
when
war
was
to
be
undertaken
for
the
chief
magistrate
clad
in
his
robes
of
office
with
solemn
pomp
to
open
the
gates
of
the
temple
of
janus
which
were
kept
shut
as
long
as
peace
endured
his
people
now
urged
the
old
king
to
perform
that
solemn
office
but
he
refused
to
do
so
while
they
contested
juno
herself
descending
from
the
skies
smote
the
doors
with
irresistible
force
and
burst
them
open
immediately
the
whole
country
was
in
a
flame
the
people
rushed
from
every
side
breathing
nothing
but
war
turnus
was
recognized
by
all
as
leader
others
joined
as
allies
chief
of
whom
was
mezentius
a
brave
and
able
soldier
but
of
detestable
cruelty
he
had
been
the
chief
of
one
of
the
neighboring
cities
but
his
people
drove
him
out

him

camilla
the
favorite
of
diana
a
huntress
and
warrior
after
the
fashion
of
the
amazons
came
with
her
band
of
mounted
followers
including
a
select
number
of
her
own
sex
and
ranged
herself
on
the
side
of
turnus
this
maiden
had
never
accustomed
her
fingers
to
the
distaff
or
the
loom
but
had
learned
to
endure
the
toils
of
war
and
in
speed
to
outstrip
the
wind
it
seemed
as
if
she
might
run
over
the
standing
corn
without
crushing
it
or
over
the
surface
of
the
water
without
dipping
her
feet
camilla
history
had
been
singular
from
the
beginning
her
father
metabus
driven
from
his
city
by
civil
discord
carried
with
him
in
his
flight
his
infant
daughter
as
he
fled
through
the
woods
his
enemies
in
hot
pursuit
he
reached
the
bank
of
the
river
amazenus
which
swelled
by
rains
seemed
to
debar
a
passage
he
paused
for
a
moment
then
decided
what
to
do
he
tied
the
infant
to
his
lance
with
wrappers
of
bark
and
poising
the
weapon
in
his
upraised
hand
thus
addressed
diana
goddess
of
the
woods
i
consecrate
this
maid
to
you
then
hurled
the
weapon
with
its
burden
to
the
opposite
bank
the
spear
flew
across
the
roaring
water
his
pursuers
were
already
upon
him
but
he
plunged
into
the
river
and
swam
across
and
found
the
spear
with
the
infant
safe
on
the
other
side
thenceforth
he
lived
among
the
shepherds
and
brought
up
his
daughter
in
woodland
arts
while
a
child
she
was
taught
to
use
the
bow
and
throw
the
javelin
with
her
sling
she
could
bring
down
the
crane
or
the
wild
swan
her
dress
was
a

many

sought

for

she
continued

such
were
the
formidable

that
ranged
themselves
against

it
was

stretched
in
sleep
on
the
bank
of
the
river
under
the
open

the

seemed
to

woke
and
paid
immediate
obedience
to
the
friendly
vision
he
sacrificed
to
juno
and
invoked
the
god
of
the
river
and
all
his
tributary
fountains
to
lend
their
aid
then
for
the
first
time
a
vessel
filled
with
armed
warriors
floated
on
the
stream
of
the
tiber
the
river
smoothed
its
waves
and
bade
its
current
flow
gently
while
impelled
by
the
vigorous
strokes
of
the
rowers
the
vessels
shot
rapidly
up
the
stream
about
the
middle
of
the
day
they
came
in
sight
of
the
scattered
buildings
of
the
infant
town
where
in
after
times
the
proud
city
of
rome
grew
whose
glory
reached
the
skies
by
chance
the
old
king
evander
was
that
day
celebrating
annual
solemnities
in
honor
of
hercules
and
all
the
gods
pallas
his
son
and
all
the
chiefs
of
the
little
commonwealth
stood
by
when
they
saw
the
tall
ship
gliding
onward
near
the
wood
they
were
alarmed
at
the
sight
and
rose
from
the
tables
but
pallas
forbade
the
solemnities
to
be
interrupted
and
seizing
a
weapon
stepped
forward
to
the
bank
he
called
aloud
demanding
who
they
were
and
what
their
object
aeneas
holding
forth
an
replied
we
are
trojans
friends
to
you
and
enemies
to
the
rutulians
we
seek
evander
and
offer
to
join
our
arms
with
yours
pallas
in
amaze
at
the
sound
of
so
great
a
name
invited
them
to
land
and
when
aeneas
touched
the
shore
he
seized
his
hand
and
held
it
long
in
friendly
grasp
proceeding
through
the
wood
they
joined
the
king
and
his
party
and
were
most
favorably
received
seats
were
provided
for
them
at
the
tables
and
the
repast
proceeded
infant
rome
when
the
solemnities
were
ended
all
moved
towards
the
city
the
king
bending
with
age
walked
between
his
son
and
aeneas
taking
the
arm
of
one
or
the
other
of
them
and
with
much
variety
of
pleasing
talk
shortening
the
way
aeneas
with
delight
looked
and
listened
observing
all
the
beauties
of
the
scene
and
learning
much
of
heroes
renowned
in
ancient
times
evander
said
these
extensive
groves
were
once
inhabited
by
fauns
and
nymphs
and
a
rude
race
of
men
who
sprang
from
the
trees
themselves
and
had
neither
laws
nor
social
culture
they
knew
not
how
to
yoke
the
cattle
nor
raise
a
harvest
nor
provide
from
present
abundance
for
future
want
but
browsed
like
beasts
upon
the
leafy
boughs
or
fed
voraciously
on
their
hunted
prey
such
were
they
when
saturn
expelled
from
olympus
by
his
sons
came
among
them
and
drew
together
the
fierce
savages
formed
them
into
society
and
gave
them
laws
such
peace
and
plenty
ensued
that
men
ever
since
have
called
his
reign
the
golden
age
but
by
degrees
far
other
times
succeeded
and
the
thirst
of
gold
and
the
thirst
of
blood
prevailed
the
land
was
a
prey
to
successive
tyrants
till
fortune
and
resistless
destiny
brought
me
hither
an
exile
from
my
native
land
arcadia
having
thus
said
he
showed
him
the
tarpeian
rock
and
the
rude
spot
then
overgrown
with
bushes
where
in
after
times
the
capitol
rose
in
all
its
magnificence
he

pointed
to
some

here
stood
janiculum

there
saturnia
the

such
discourse
brought
them
to
the
cottage
of
poor
evander
whence
they
saw
the
lowing
herds
roaming
over
the
plain
where
now
the
proud
and
stately
forum

they
entered
and
a
couch
was
spread
for
aeneas
well
stuffed
with
leaves
and
covered
with
the
skin

a
libyan
bear
next
morning
awakened
by
the
dawn
and
the
shrill
song
of
birds
beneath
the
eaves
of
his
low
mansion
old
evander
rose
clad
in
a
tunic
and
a
panther
skin
thrown
over
his
shoulders
with
sandals
on
his
feet
and
his
good
sword
girded
to
his
side
he
went
forth
to
seek
his
guest
two
mastiffs
followed
him
his
whole
retinue
and
body
guard
he
found
the
hero
attended
by
his
faithful
achates
and
pallas
soon
joining
them
the
old
king
spoke
thus
illustrious
trojan
it
is
but
little
we
can
do
in
so
great
a
cause
our
state
is
feeble
hemmed
in
on
one
side
by
the
river
on
the
other
by
the
rutulians
but
i
propose
to
ally
you
with
a
people
numerous
and
rich
to
whom
fate
has
brought
you
at
the
propitious
moment
the
etruscans
hold
the
country
beyond
the
river
mezentius
was
their
king
a
monster
of
cruelty
who
invented
torments
to
gratify
his
vengeance
he
would
fasten
the
dead
to
the
living
hand
to
hand
and
face
to
face
and
leave
the
wretched
victims
to
die
in
that
dreadful
embrace
at
length
the
people
cast
him
out
him
and
his
house
they
burned
his
palace
and
slew
his
friends
he
escaped
and
took
refuge
with
turnus
who
protects
him
with
arms
the
etruscans
demand
that
he
shall
be
given
up
to
deserved
punishment
and
would
ere
now
have
attempted
to
enforce
their
demand
but
their
priests
restrain
them
telling
them
that
it
is
the
will
of
heaven
that
no
native
of
the
land
shall
guide
them
to
victory
and
that
thsir
destined
leader
must
come
from
across
the
sea
they
have
offered
the
crown
to
me
but
i
am
too
old
to
undertake
such
great
affairs
and
my
son
is
which
precludes
him
from
the
choice
you
equally
by
birth
and
time
of
life
and
fame
in
arms
pointed
out
by
the
gods
have
but
to
appear
to
be
hailed
at
once
as
their
leader
with
you
i
will
join
pallas
my
son
my
only
hope
and
comfort
under
you
he
shall
learn
the
art
of
war
and
strive
to
emulate
your
great
exploits
then
the
king
ordered
horses
to
be
furnished
for
the
trojan
chiefs
and
aeneas
with
a
chosen
band
of
followers
and
pallas
accompanying
mounted
and
took
the
way
to
the
etruscan
city
footnote
the
poet
here
inserts
a
famous
line
which
is
thought
to
imitate
in
its
sound
the
galloping
of
horses

may
be
thus
translated

aeneas

safely
arrived
at
the
etruscan
camp
and
were
received
with
open
arms
by
tarchon
and
his
countrymen
nisus
and
euryalus
in
the
meanwhile
turnus
had
collected
his
bands
and
made

preparations
for

juno
sent

to
him
with
a
message
inciting
him
to
take
advantage
of
the
absence
of
aeneas
and
surprise
the
trojan
camp
accordingly
the
attempt
was
made
but
the
trojans
were
found
on
their
guard
and
having
received
strict
orders
from
aeneas
not
to
fight
in
his
absence
they
lay
still
in
their
intrenchments
and
resisted
all
the
efforts
of
the
rutulians
to
draw
them
into
the
field
night
coming
on
the
army
of
turnus
in
high
spirits
at
their
fancied
superiority
feasted
and
enjoyed
themselves
and
finally
stretched
themselves
on
the
field
and
slept
secure
in
the
camp
of
the
trojans
things
were
far
otherwise
there
all
was
watchfulness
and
anxiety
and
impatience
for
aeneas
return
nisus
stood
guard
at
the
entrance
of
the
camp
and
euryalus
a
youth
distinguished
above
all
in
the
army
for
graces
of
person
and
fine
qualities
was
with
him
these
two
were
friends
and
brothers
in
arms
nisus
said
to
his
friend
do
you
perceive
what
confidence
and
carelessness
the
enemy
display
their
lights
are
few
and
dim
and
the
men
seem
all
oppressed
with
wine
or
sleep
you
know
how
anxiously
our
chiefs
wish
to
send
to
aeneas
and
to
get
intelligence
from
him
now
i
am
strongly
moved
to
make
my
way
through
the
enemy
camp
and
to
go
in
search
of
our
chief
if
i
succeed
the
glory
of
the
deed
will
be
reward
enough
for
me
and
if
they
judge
the
service
deserves
anything
more
let
them
pay
it
to
you
euryalus
all
on
fire
with
the
love
of
adventure
replied
would
you
then
nisus
refuse
to
share
your
enterprise
with
me
and
shall
i
let
you
go
into
such
danger
alone
not
so
my
brave
father
brought
me
up
nor
so
have
i
planned
for
myself
when
i
joined
the
standard
of
aeneas
and
resolved
to
hold
my
life
cheap
in
comparison
with
honor
nisus
replied
i
doubt
it
not
my
friend
but
you
know
the
uncertain
event
of
such
an
undertaking
and
whatever
may
happen
to
me
i
wish
you
to
be
safe
you
are
younger
than
i
and
have
more
of
life
in
prospect
nor
can
i
be
the
cause
of
such
grief
to
your
mother
who
has
chosen
to
be
here
in
the
camp
with
you
rather
than
stay
and
live
in
peace
with
the
other
matrons
in
acestes
city
euryalus
replied
say
no
more
in
vain
you
seek
arguments
to
dissuade
me
i
am
fixed
in
the
resolution
to
go
with
you
let
us
lose
no
time
they
called
the
guard
and
committing
the
watch
to
them
sought
the
general
tent
they
found
the
chief
officers
in
consultation
deliberating
how
they
should
send
notice
to
aeneas
of
their
situation
the
offer
of
the
two
friends
was
gladly
accepted
themselves
loaded
with
praises
and
promised
the
most
liberal
rewards
in
case
of
success
iulus
especially
addressed
euryalus
assuring
him
of
his
lasting
friendship
euryalus
replied
i
have
but
one
boon
to
ask
my
aged
mother
is
with
me
in
the
camp
for
me
she
left
the
trojan
soil
and
would
not
stay
behind
with
the
other
matrons
at
the
city
of
acestes
i
go
now
without
taking
leave
of
her
i
could
not
bear
her
tears
nor
set
at
nought
her
entreaties
but
do
thou
i
beseech
you
comfort
her
in
her
distress
promise
me
that
and
i
shall
go
more
boldly
into
whatever
dangers
may
present
themselves
iulus
and
the
other
chiefs
were
moved
to
tears
and
promised
to
do
all
his
request
your
mother
shall
be
mine
said
iulus
and
all
that
i
have
promised
to
you
shall
be
made
good
to
her
if
you
do
not
return
to
receive
it
the
two
friends
left
the
camp
and
plunged
at
once
into
the
midst
of
the
enemy
they
found
no
watch
no
sentinels
posted
but
all
about
the
sleeping
soldiers
strewn
on
the
grass
and
among
the
wagons
the
laws
of
war
at
that
early
day
did
not
forbid
a
brave
man
to
slay
a
sleeping
foe
and
the
two
trojans
slew
as
they
passed
such
of
the
enemy
as
they
could
without
exciting
alarm
in
one
tent
euryalus
made
prize
of
a
helmet
brilliant
with
gold
and
plumes
they
had
passed
through
the
enemy
ranks
without
being
discovered
but
now
suddenly
appeared
a
troop
directly
in
front
of
them
which
under
volscens
their
leader
were
approaching
the
camp
the
glittering
helmet
of
euryalus
caught
their
attention
and
volscens
hailed
the
two
and
demanded
who
and
whence
they
were
they
made
no
answer
but
plunged
into
the
wood
the
horsemen
scattered
in
all
directions
to
intercept
their
flight
nisus
had
eluded
pursuit
and
was
out
of
danger
but
euryalus
being
missing
he
turned
back
to
seek
him
he
again
entered
the
wood
and
soon
came
within
sound
of
voices
looking
through
the
thicket
he
saw
the
whole
band
surrounding
euryalus
with
noisy
questions
what
should
he
do
how
extricate
the
youth
or
would
it
be
better
to
die
with
him
raising
his
eyes
to
the
moon
which
now
shone
clear
he
said
goddess
favor
my
effort
and
aiming
his
javelin
at
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
troop
struck
him
in
the
back
and
stretched
him
on
the
plain
with
a
in
the
midst
of
their
amazement
another
weapon
flew
and
another
of
the
party
fell
dead
volscens
the
leader
ignorant
whence
the
darts
came
rushed
sword
in
hand
upon
euryalus
you
shall
pay
the
penalty
of
both
he
said
and
would
have
plunged
the
sword
into
his
bosom
when
nisus
who
from
his
concealment
saw
the
peril
of
his
friend
rushed
forward
exclaiming
was
i
was
i
turn
your
swords
against
me
rutulians
i
did
it
he
only
followed
me
as
a
friend
while
he
spoke
the
sword
fell
and
pierced
the
comely
bosom
of
euryalus
his
head
fell
over
on
his
shoulder
like
a
flower
cut
down
by
the
plough
nisus
rushed
upon
volscens
and
plunged
his
sword
into
his
body
and
was
himself
slain
on
the
instant
by
numberless
blows
mezentius
aeneas
with
his
etrurian
allies
arrived
on
the
scene
of
action
in
time
to
rescue
his
beleaguered
camp
and
now
the
two
armies
being
nearly
equal
in
strength
the
war
began
in
good
earnest
we
can
not
find
space
for
all
the
details
but
must
simply
record
the
fate
of
the
principal
characters
whom
we
have
introduced
to
our
readers
the
tyrant
mezentius
finding
himself
engaged
against
his
revolting
subjects
raged
like
a
wild
beast
he
slew
all
who
dared
to
withstand
him
and
put
the
multitude
to
flight
wherever
he
appeared
at
last
he
encountered
aeneas
and
the
armies
stood
still
to
see
the
issue
mezentius
threw
his
spear
which
striking
aeneas
shield
glanced
off
and
hit
anthor
he
was
a
grecian
by
birth
who
had
left
argos
his
native
city
and
followed
evander
into
italy
the
poet
says
of
him
with
simple
pathos
which
has
made
the
words
proverbial
he
fell
unhappy
by
a
wound
intended
for
another
looked
up
at
the
skies
and
dying
remembered
sweet
argos
footnote

proverbial
expressions
aeneas
now
in
turn
hurled
his
lance
it
pierced
the
shield
of
mezentius
and
wounded
him
in
the
thigh
lausus
his
son
could
not
bear
the
sight
but
rushed
forward
and
interposed
himself
while
the
followers
pressed
round
mezentius
and
bore
him
away
aeneas
held
his
sword
suspended
over
lausus
and
delayed
to
strike
but
the
furious
youth
pressed
on
and
he
was
compelled
to
deal
the
fatal
blow
lausus
fell
and
aeneas
bent
over
him
in
pity
hapless
youth
he
said
what
can
i
do
for
you
worthy
of
your
praise
keep
those
arms
in
which
you
glory
and
fear
not
but
that
your
body
shall
be
restored
to
your
friends
and
have
due
funeral
honors
so
saying
he
called
the
timid
followers
and
delivered
the
body
into
their
hands
mezentius
meanwhile
had
been
borne
to
the
riverside
and
washed
his
wound
soon
the
news
reached
him
of
lausus
death
and
rage
and
despair
supplied
the
place
of
strength
he
mounted
his
horse
and
dashed
into
the
thickest
of
the
fight
seeking
aeneas
having
found
him
footnote
see
proverbial
expressions
he
rode
round
him
in
a
circle
throwing
one
javelin
after
another
while
aeneas
stood
fenced
with
his
shield
turning
every
way
to
meet
them
at
last
after
mezentius
had
three
times
made
the
circuit
aeneas
threw
his
lance
directly
at
the
horse
head
it
pierced
his
temples
and
he
fell
while
a
shout
from
both
armies
rent
the
skies
mezentius
asked
no
mercy
but
only
that
his
body
might
be
spared
the
insults
of
his
revolted
subjects
and
be
buried
in
the
same
grave
with
his
son
he
received
the
fatal
stroke
not
unprepared

pallas
bore
himself
bravely
but
fell
by
the
lance
of
turnus
the
victor
almost
relented
when
he
saw
the
brave
youth
lying
dead
at
his
feet
and
spared
to
use
the
privilege
of
a
conqueror
in
despoiling
him
of
his
arms
the
belt
only
adorned
with
studs
and
carvings
of
gold
he
took
and
clasped
round
his

the
rest
he
remitted
to
the
friends
of
the
slain
after
the
battle
there
was
a
cessation
of
arms
for
some
days
to
allow
both
armies
to
bury
their
dead
in
this
interval
aeneas
challenged
turnus
to
decide
the
contest
by
single
combat
but
turnus
evaded
the
challenge
another
battle
ensued
in
which
camilla
the
virgin
warrior
was
chiefly
conspicuous
her
deeds
of
valor
surpassed
those
of
the
bravest
warriors
and
many
trojans
and
etruscans
fell
pierced
with
her
darts
or
struck
down
by
her
at
last
an
etruscan
named
aruns
who
had
watched
her
long
seeking
for
some
advantage
observed
her
pursuing
a
flying
enemy
whose
splendid
armor
offered
a
tempting
prize
intent
on
the
chase
she
observed
not
her
danger
and
the
javelin
of
aruns
struck
her
and
inflicted
a
fatal
wound
she
fell
and
breathed
her
last
in
the
arms
of
her
attendant
maidens
but
diana
who
beheld
her
fate
suffered
not
her
slaughter
to
be
unavenged
aruns

he
stole
away
glad

frightened
was
struck
by
a

by

and
died
ignobly

the
final
conflict

between
aeneas
and

turnus
had
avoided
the
contest
as
long
as
he
could
but
at
last
impelled
by
the
ill
success
of
his
arms
and
by
the
murmurs
of
his
followers
he
braced
himself
to
the
conflict
it
could
not
be
doubtful
on
the
side
of
aeneas
were
the
expressed
decree
of
destiny
the
aid
of
his
at

threw
his
which
penetrated
the
shield
of
turnus
and
pierced
his
thigh
then
turnus
fortitude
forsook
him
and
he
begged
for
mercy
and
aeneas
would
have
given
him
his
life
but
at
the
instant
his
eye
fell
on
the
belt
of
pallas
which
turnus
had
taken
from
the
slaughtered
youth
instantly
his
rage
revived
and
exclaiming
pallas
immolates
thee
with
this
blow
he
thrust
him
through
with
his
sword
here
the
poem
of
the
aeneid

and
we
are
left
to
infer
that
aeneas
having
triumphed
over
his
foes
obtained
lavinia
for
his
bride

that
he
founded

the
doctrines
of
the
pythagoreans
pythagoras
born
five
hundred
and
forty
years
was
a
native
of
the
island
of
samos
but
passed
the
chief
portion
of
his
life
at
crotona
in
italy
he
is
therefore
sometimes
called
the
samian
and
sometimes
the
philosopher
of
crotona
when
young
he
travelled
extensively
and
it
is
said
visited
egypt
where
he
was
instructed
by
the
priests
in
all
their
learning
and
afterwards
journeyed
to
the
east
and
visited
the
persian
and
chaldean
magi
and
the
brahmins
of
india
at
crotona
where
he
finally
established
himself
his
extraordinary
qualities
collected
round
him
a
great
number
of
disciples
the
inhabitants
were
notorious
for
luxury
and
licentiousness
but
the
good
effects
of
his
influence
were
soon
visible
sobriety
and
temperance
succeeded
six
hundred
of
the
inhabitants
became
his
disciples
and
enrolled
themselves
in
a
society
to
aid
each
other
in
the
pursuit
of
wisdom
uniting
their
property
in
one
common
stock
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole
they
were
required
to
practise
the
greatest
purity
and
simplicity
of
manners
the
first
lesson
they
learned
was
silence
for
a
time
they
were
required
to
be
only
hearers
he
pythagoras
said
so
ipse
dixit
was
to
be
held
by
them
as
sufficient
without
any
proof
it
was
only
the
advanced
pupils
after
years
of
patient
submission
who
were
allowed
to
ask
questions
and
to
state
objections
pythagoras
considered
numbers
as
the
essence
and
principle
of
all
things
and
attributed
to
them
a
real
and
distinct
existence
so
that
in
his
view
they
were
the
elements
out
of
which
the
universe
was
constructed
how
he
conceived
this
process
has
never
been
satisfactorily
explained
he
traced
the
various
forms
and
phenomena
of
the
world
to
numbers
as
their
basis
and
essence
the
monad
or
unit
he
regarded
as
the
source
of
all
numbers
the
number
two
was
imperfect
and
the
cause
of
increase
and
division
three
was
called
the
number
of
the
whole
because
it
had
a
beginning
middle
and
end
four
representing
the
square
is
in
the
highest
degree
perfect
and
ten
as
it
contains
the
sum
of
the
four
prime
numbers
comprehends
all
musical
and
arithmetical
proportions
and
denotes
the
system
of
the
world
as
the
numbers
proceed
from
the
monad
so
he
regarded
the
pure
and
simple
essence
of
the
deity
as
the
source
of
all
the
forms
of
nature
gods
demons
and
heroes
are
emanations
of
the
supreme
and
there
is
a
fourth
emanation
the
human
soul
this
is
immortal
and
when
freed
from
the
fetters
of
the
body
passes
to
the
habitation
of
the
dead
where
it
remains
till
it
returns
to
the
world
to
dwell
in
some
other
human
or
animal
body
and
at
last
when
sufficiently
purified
it
returns
to
the
source
from
which
it
proceeded
this
doctrine
of
the
transmigration
of
souls
metempsychosis
which
was
originally
egyptian
and
connected
with
the
doctrine
of
reward
and
punishment
of
human
actions
was
the
chief
cause
why
the
pythagoreans
killed
no
animals
ovid
represents
pythagoras
addressing
his
disciples
in
these
words
souls
never
die
but
always
on
quitting
one
abode
pass
to
another
i
myself
can
remember
that
in
the
time
of
the
trojan
war
i
was
euphorbus
the
son
of
panthus
and
fell
by
the
spear
of
menelaus
lately
being
in
the
temple
of
juno
at
argos
i
recognized
my
shield
hung
up
there
among
the
trophies
all
things
change
nothing
perishes
the
soul
passes
hither
and
thither
occupying
now
this
body
now
that
passing
from
the
body
of
a
beast
into
that
of
a
man
and
thence
to
a
beast
again
as
wax
is
stamped
with
certain
figures
then
melted
then
stamped
anew
with
others
yet
is
always
the
same
wax
so
the
soul
being
always
the
same
yet
wears
at
different
times
different
forms
therefore
if
the
love
of
kindred
is
not
extinct
in
your
bosoms
forbear
i
entreat
you
to
violate
the
life
of
those
who
may
haply
be
your
own
relatives
shakspeare
in
the
merchant
of
venice
makes
gratiano
allude
to
the
metempsychosis
where
he
says
to
shylock
thou
almost
me
waver
in
my
faith
to
hold
opinion
with
pythagoras
that
souls
of
animals
infuse
themselves
into
the
trunks
of
men
thy
currish
spirit
governed
a
wolf
who
hanged
for
human
slaughter
infused
his
soul
in
thee
for
thy
desires
are
wolfish
bloody
starved
and
ravenous
the
relation
of
the
notes
of
the
musical
scale
to
numbers
whereby
harmony
results
from
vibrations
in
equal
times
and
discord
from
the
reverse
led
pythagoras
to
apply
the
word
harmony
to
the
visible
creation
meaning
by
it
the
just
adaptation
of
parts
to
each
other
this
is
the
idea
which
dryden
expresses
in
the
beginning
of
his
song
for
cecilia
day
from
harmony
from
heavenly
harmony
this
everlasting
frame
began
from
harmony
to
harmony
through
all
the
compass
of
the
notes
it
ran
the
diapason
closing
full
in
man
in
the
centre
of
the
universe
he
taught
there
was
a
central
fire
the
principle
of
life
the
central
fire
was
surrounded
by
the
earth
the
moon
the
sun
and
the
five
planets
the
distances
of
the
various
heavenly
bodies
from
one
another
were
conceived
to
correspond
to
the
proportions
of
the
musical
scale
the
heavenly
bodies
with
the
gods
who
inhabited
them
were
supposed
to
perform
a
choral
dance
round
the
central
fire
not
without
song
it
is
this
doctrine
which
shakspeare
alludes
to
when
he
makes
lorenzo
teach
astronomy
to
jessica
in
this
fashion
look
jessica
see
how
the
floor
of
heaven
is
thick
inlaid
with
patines
of
bright
gold
there
not
the
smallest
orb
that
thou
but
in
his
motion
like
an
angel
sings
still
quiring
to
the
cherubim
such
harmony
is
in
immortal
souls
but
whilst
this
muddy
vesture
of
decay
doth
grossly
close
it
in
we
can
not
hear
it
merchant
of
venice
the
spheres
were
conceived
to
be
crystalline
or
glassy
fabrics
arranged
over
one
another
like
a
nest
of
bowls
reversed
in
the
substance
of
each
sphere
one
or
more
of
the
heavenly
bodies
was
supposed
to
be
fixed
so
as
to
move
with
it
as
the
spheres
are
transparent
we
look
through
them
and
see
the
heavenly
bodies
which
they
contain
and
carry
round
with
them
but
as
these
spheres
can
not
move
on
one
another
without
friction
a
sound
is
thereby
produced
which
is
of
exquisite
harmony
too
fine
for
mortal
ears
to
recognize
milton
in
his
hymn
on
the
nativity
thus
alludes
to
the
music
of
the

to
have

hearing

smote

years
old
upon
his
shoulders
and
afterwards
eating
the
whole
of
it
in
a
single
day
the
mode
of
his
death
is
thus
related
as
he
was
passing
through
a
forest
he
saw
the
trunk
of
a
tree
which
had
been
partially
split
open
by
cutters
and
attempted
to
rend
it
further
but
the
wood
closed
upon
his
hands
and
held
him
fast
in
which
state
he
was
attacked
and
devoured
by
wolves

how
looked
he
round
egyptian
deities
the
egyptians
acknowledged
as
the
highest
deity
amun
afterwards
called
zeus
or
jupiter
ammon
amun
manifested
himself
in
his
word
or
will
which
created
kneph
and
athor
of
different
sexes
from
kneph
and
athor
proceeded
osiris
and
isis
osiris
was
worshipped
as
the
god
of
the
sun
the
source
of
warmth
life
and
fruitfulness
in
addition
to
which
he
was
also
regarded
as
the
god
of
the
nile
who
annually
visited
his
wife
isis
the
earth
by
means
of
an
inundation
serapis
or
hermes
is
sometimes
represented
as
identical
with
osiris
and
sometimes
as
a
distinct
divinity
the
ruler
of

and
god
of
medicine
anubis
is
the
guardian
god
represented
with

horus
or
harpocrates
was
the
son
of
osiris
he
is
represented
seated
on
a
lotus
flower
with
his
finger
on
his

as
the
god
of
silence

of

under

hush
myth
of
osiris
and
isis
osiris
and
isis
were
at
one
time
induced
to
descend
to
the
earth
to
bestow
gifts
and
blessings
on
its
inhabitants
isis
showed
them
first
the
use
of
wheat
and
barley
and
osiris
made
the
instruments
of
agriculture
and
taught
men
the
use
of
them
as
well
as
how
to
harness
the
ox
to
the
plough
he
then
gave
men
laws
the
institution
of
marriage
a
civil
organization
and
taught
them
how
to
worship
the
gods
after
he
had
thus
made
the
valley
of
the
nile
a
happy
country
he
assembled
a
host
with
which
he
went
to
bestow
his
blessings
upon
the
rest
of
the
world
he
conquered
the
nations
everywhere
but
not
with
weapons
only
with
music
and
eloquence
his
brother
typhon
saw
this
and
filled
with
envy
and
malice
sought
during
his
absence
to
usurp
his
throne
but
isis
who
held
the
reins
of
government
frustrated
his
plans
still
more
embittered
he
now
resolved
to
kill
his
brother
this
he
did
in
the
following
manner
having
organized
a
conspiracy
of
members
he
went
with
them
to
the
feast
which
was
celebrated
in
honor
of
the
king
return
he
then
caused
a
box
or
chest
to
be
brought
in
which
had
been
made
to
fit
exactly
the
size
of
osiris
and
declared
that
he
wouldd
would
give
that
chest
of
precious
wood
to
whosoever
could
get
into
it
the
rest
tried
in
vain
but
no
sooner
was
osiris
in
it
than
typhon
and
his
companions
closed
the
lid
and
flung
the
chest
into
the
nile
when
isis
heard
of
the
cruel
murder
she
wept
and
mourned
and
then
with
her
hair
shorn
clothed
in
black
and
beating
her
breast
she
sought
diligently
for
the
body
of
her
husband
in
this
search
she
was
materially
assisted
by
anubis
the
son
of
osiris
and
nephthys
they
sought
in
vain
for
some
time
for
when
the
chest
carried
by
the
waves
to
the
shores
of
byblos
had
become
entangled
in
the
reeds
that
grew
at
the
edge
of
the
water
the
divine
power
that
dwelt
in
the
body
of
osiris
imparted
such
strength
to
the
shrub
that
it
grew
into
a
mighty
tree
enclosing
in
its
trunk
the
coffin
of
the
god
this
tree
with
its
sacred
deposit
was
shortly
after
felled
and
erected
as
a
column
in
the
palace
of
the
king
of
phoenicia
but
at
length
by
the
aid
of
anubis
and
the
sacred
birds
isis
ascertained
these
facts
and
then
went
to
the
royal
city
there
she
offered
herself
at
the
palace
as
a
servant
and
being
admitted
threw
off
her
disguise
and
appeared
as
a
goddess
surrounded
with
thunder
and
lightning
striking
the
column
with
her
wand
she
caused
it
to
split
open
and
give
up
the
sacred
coffin
this
she
seized
and
returned
with
it
and
concealed
it
in
the
depth
of
a
forest
but
typhon
discovered
it
and
cutting
the
body
into
fourteen
pieces
scattered
them
hither
and
thither
after
a
tedious
search
isis
found
thirteen
pieces
the
fishes
of
the
nile
having
eaten
the
other
this
she
replaced
by
an
imitation
of
sycamore
wood
and
buried
the
body
at
philae
which
became
ever
after
the
great
burying
place
of
the
nation
and
the
spot
to
which
pilgrimages
were
made
from
all
parts
of
the
country
a
temple
of
surpassing
magnificence
was
also
erected
there
in
honor
of
the
god
and
at
every
place
where
one
of
his
limbs
had
been
found
minor
temples
and
tombs
were
built
to
commemorate
the
event
osiris
became
after
that
the
tutelar
deity
of
the
egyptians
his
soul
was
supposed
always
to
inhabit
the
body
of
the
bull
apis
and
at
his
death
to
transfer
itself
to
his
successor
apis
the
bull
of
memphis
was
worshipped
with
the
greatest
reverence
by
the
egyptians
the
individual
animal
who
was
held
to
be
apis
was
recognized
by
certain
signs
it
was
requisite
that
he
should
be
quite
black
have
a
white
square
mark
on
the
forehead
another
in
the
form
of
an
eagle
on
his
back
and
under
his
tongue
a
lump
somewhat
in
the
shape
of
a
scarabaeus
or
beetle
as
soon
as
a
bull
thus
marked
was
found
by
those
sent
in
search
of
him
he
was
placed
in
a
building
facing
the
east
and
was
fed
with
milk
for
four
months
at
the
expiration
of
this
term
the
priests
repaired
at
new
moon
with
great
pomp
to
his
habitation
and
saluted
him
apis
he
was
placed
in
a
vessel
magnificently
decorated
and
conveyed
down
the
nile
to
memphis
where
a
temple
with
two
chapels
and
a
court
for
exercise
was
assigned
to
him
sacrifices
were
made
to
him
and
once
every
year
about
the
time
when
the
nile
began
to
rise
a
golden
cup
was
thrown
into
the
river
and
a
grand
festival
was
held
to
celebrate
his
birthday
the
people
believed
that
during
this
festival
the
crocodiles
forgot
their
natural
ferocity
and
became
harmless
there
was
however
one
drawback
to
his
happy
lot
he
was
not
permitted
to
live
beyond
a
certain
period
and
if
when
he
had
attained
the
age
of
years
he
still
survived
the
priests
drowned
him
in
the
sacred
cistern
and
then
buried
him
in
the
temple
of
serapis
on
the
death
of
this
bull
whether
it
occurred
in
the
course
of
nature
or
by
violence
the
whole
land
was
filled
with
sorrow
and
lamentations
which
lasted
until
his
successor
was
found
we
find
the
following
item
in
one
of
the
newspapers
of
the
day
the
tomb
of
the
excavations
going
on
at
memphis
bid
fair
to
make
that
buried
city
as
interesting
as
pompeii
the
monster
tomb
of
apis
is
now
open
after
having
lain
unknown
for
centuries
milton
in
his
hymn
on
the
nativity
alludes
to
the
egyptian
deities
not
as
imaginary
beings
but
as
real
demons
put
to
flight
by
the
coming
of
christ
the

oracles
oracle
was
the
name
used
to
denote
the
place
where
answers
were
supposed
to
be
given
by
any
of
the
divinities
to
those
who
consulted
them
respecting
the
future
the
word
was
also
used
to
signify
the
response
which
was
given
the
most
ancient
grecian
oracle
was
that
of
jupiter
at
dodona
according
to
one
account
it
was
established
in
the
following
manner
two
black
doves
took
their
flight
from
thebes
in
egypt
one
flew
to
dodona
in
epirus
and
alighting
in
a
grove
of
oaks
it
proclaimed
in
human
language
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
that
they
must
establish
there
an
oracle
of
jupiter
the
other
dove
flew
to
the
temple
of
jupiter
ammon
in
the
libyan
oasis
and
delivered
a
similar
command
there
another
account
is
that
they
were
not
doves
but
priestesses
who
were
carried
off
from
thebes
in
egypt
by
the
phoenicians
and
set
up
oracles
at
the
oasis
and
dodona
the
responses
of
the
oracle
were
given
from
the
trees
by
the
branches
rustling
in
the
wind
the
sounds
being
interpreted
by
the
priests
but
the
most
celebrated
of
the
grecian
oracles
was
that
of
apollo
at
delphi
a
city
built
on
the
slopes
of
parnassus
in
phocis
it
had
been
observed
at
a
very
early
period
that
the
goats
feeding
on
parnassus
were
thrown
into
convulsions
when
they
approached
a
certain
long
deep
cleft
in
the
side
of
the
mountain
this
was
owing
to
a
peculiar
vapor
arising
out
of
the
cavern
and
one
of
the
goatherds
was
induced
to
try
its
effects
upon
himself
inhaling
the
intoxicating
air
he
was
affected
in
the
same
manner
as
the
cattle
had
been
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
country
unable
to
explain
the
circumstance
imputed
the
convulsive
ravings
to
which
he
gave
utterance
while
under
the
power
of
the
exhalations
to
a
divine
inspiration
the
fact
was
speedily
circulated
widely
and
a
temple
was
erected
on
the
spot
the
prophetic
influence
was
at
first
variously
attributed
to
the
goddess
earth
to
neptune
themis
and
others
but
it
was
at
length
assigned
to
apollo
and
to
him
alone
a
priestess
was
appointed
whose
office
it
was
to
inhale
the
hallowed
air
and
who
was
named
the
pythia
she
was
prepared
for
this
duty
by
previous
ablution
at
the
fountain
of
castalia
and
being
crowned
with
laurel
was
seated
upon
a
tripod
similarly
adorned
which
was
placed
over
the
chasm
whence
the
divine
afflatus
proceeded
her
inspired
words
while
thus
situated
were
interpreted
by
the
priests
oracle
of
trophonius
besides
the
oracles
of
jupiter
and
apollo
at
dodona
and
delphi
that
of
trophonius
in
boeotia
was
held
in
high
estimation
trophonius
and
agamedes
were
brothers
they
were
distinguished
architects
and
built
the
temple
of
apollo
at
delphi
and
a
treasury
for
king
hyrieus
in
the
wall
of
the
treasury
they
placed
a
stone
in
such
a
manner
that
it
could
be
taken
out
and
by
this
means
from
time
to
time
purloined
the
treasure
this
amazed
hyrieus
for
his
locks
and
seals
were
untouched
and
yet
his
wealth
continually
diminished
at
length
he
set
a
trap
for
the
thief
and
agamedes
was
caught
trophonias
unable
to
extricate
him
and
fearing
that
when
found
he
would
be
compelled
by
torture
to
discover
his
accomplice
cut
off
his
head
trophonius
himself
is
said
to
have
been
shortly
afterwards
swallowed
up
by
the
earth
the
oracle
of
trophonius
was
at
lebadea
in
boeotia
during
a
great
drought
the
boeotians
it
is
said
were
directed
by
the
god
at
delphi
to
seek
aid
of
trophonius
at
lebadea
they
came
thither
but
could
find
no
pracle
one
of
them
however
happening
to
see
a
swarm
of
bees
followed
them
to
a
chasm
in
the
earth
which
proved
to
be
the
place
sought
peculiar
ceremonies
were
to
be
performed
by
the
person
who
came
to
consult
the
oracle
after
these
preliminaries
he
descended
into
the
cave
by
a
narrow
passage
this
place
could
be
entered
only
in
the
night
the
person
returned
from
the
cave
by
the
same
narrow
passage
bat
walking
backwards
he
appeared
melancholy
and
defected
and
hence
the
proverb
which
was
applied
to
a
person
spirited
and
gloomy
he
has
been
consulting
the
oracle
of
trophonius
oracle
of
aesculapius
there
were
numerous
oracles
of
aesculapius
but
the
most
celebrated
one
was
at
epidaurus
here
the
sick
sought
responses
and
the
recovery
of
their
health
by
sleeping
in
the
temple
it
has
been
inferred
from
the
accounts
that
have
come
down
to
us
that
the
treatment
of
the
sick
resembled
what
is
now
called
animal
magnetism
or
mesmerism
serpents
sacred
to
aesculapius
probably
because
of
a
superstition
that
those
animals
have
a
faculty
of
renewing
their
youth
by
a
change
of
skin
the
worship
of
aesculapius
was
introduced
into
rome
in
a
time
of
great
sickness
and
an
embassy
sent
to
the
temple
of
epidaurus
to
entreat
the
aid
of
the
god
aesculapius
was
propitious
and
on
the
return
of
the
ship
accompanied
it
in
the
form
of
a
serpent
arriving
in
the
river
tiber
the
serpent
glided
from
the
vessel
and
took
possession
of
an
island
in
the
river
and
a
temple
was
there
erected
to
his
honor
oracle
of
apis
at
memphis
the
sacred
bull
apis
gave
answer
to
those
who
consulted
him
by
the
manner
in
which
he
received
or
rejected
what
was
presented
to
him
if
the
bull
refused
food
from
the
hand
of
the
inquirer
it
was
considered
an
unfavorable
sign
and
the
contrary
when
he
received
it
it
has
been
a
question
whether
oracular
responses
ought
to
be
ascribed
to
mere
human
contrivance
or
to
the
agency
of
evil
spirits
the
latter
opinion
has
been
most
general
in
past
ages
a
third
theory
has
been
advanced
since
the
phenomena
of
mesmerism
have
attracted
attention
that
something
like
the
mesmeric
trance
was
induced
in
the
pythoness
and
the
faculty
of
clairvoyance
really
called
into
action
another
question
is
as
to
the
time
when
the
pagan
oracles
ceased
to
give
responses
ancient
christian
writers
assert
that
they
became
silent
at
the
birth
of
christ
and
were
heard
no
more
after
that
date
milton
adopts
this
view
in
his
hymn
on
the
mativity
and
in
lines
of
solemn
and
elevated
beauty
pictures
the
consternation
of
the
heathen
idols
at
the
advent
of
the
saviour
the
oracles
are
dumb
no

or
hideous
hum

close
of

inquiry
suggests
itself
whence
came
these
stories
have
they
a
foundation
in
truth
or
are
they
simply
dreams
of
the
imagination
philosophers
have
suggested
various
theories
on
the
subject
and
the
scriptural
theory
according
to
which
all
mythological
legends
are
derived
from
the
narratives
of
scripture
though
the
real
facts
have
been
disguised
and
altered
thus
deucalion
is
only
another
name
for
noah
hercules
for
samson
arion
for
jonah

sir

in

against

there
are
doubtless
many
curious
coincidences
like
these
but
the
theory
can
not
without
extravagance
be
pushed
so
far
as
to
account
for
any
great
proportion
of
the
stories
the
historical
theory
according
to
which
all
the
persons
mentioned
in
mythology
were
once
real
human
beings
and
the
legends
and
fabulous
traditions
relating
to
them
are
merely
the
additions
and
embellishments
of
later
times
thus
the
story
of
aeolus
the
king
and
god
of
the
winds
is
supposed
to
have
risen
from
the
fact
that
aeolus
was
the
ruler
of
some
islands
in
the
tyrrhenian
sea
where
he
reigned
as
a
just
and
pious
king
and
taught
the
natives
the
use
of
sails
for
ships
and
how
to
tell
from
the
signs
of
the
atmosphere
the
changes
of
the
weather
and
the
winds
cadmus
who
the
legend
says
sowed
the
earth
with
dragon
teeth
from
which
sprang
a
crop
of
armed
men
was
in
fact
an
emigrant
from
phoenicia
and
brought
with
him
into
greece
the
knowledge
of
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
which
he
taught
to
the
natives
from
these
rudiments
of
learning
sprung
civilization
which
the
poets
have
always
been
prone
to
describe
as
a
deterioration
of
man
first
estate
the
golden
age
of
innocence
and
simplicity
the
allegorical
theory
supposes
that
all
the
myths
of
the
ancients
were
allegorical
and
symbolical
and
contained
some
moral
religious
or
philosophical
truth
or
historical
fact
under
the
form
of
an
allegory
but
came
in
process
of
time
to
be
understood
literally
thus
saturn
who
devours
his
own
children
is
the
same
power
whom
the
greeks
called
cronos
time
which
may
truly
be
said
to
destroy
whatever
it
has
brought
into
existence
the
story
of
io
is
interpreted
in
a
similar
manner
io
is
the
moon
and
argus
the
starry
sky
which
as
it
were
keeps
sleepless
watch
over
her
the
fabulous
wanderings
of
io
represent
the
continual
revolutions
of
the
moon
which
also
suggested
to
milton
the
same
idea
to
behold
the
wandering
moon
riding
near
her
highest
noon
like
one
that
had
been
led
astray
in
the

wide

way
il
penseroso
the
physical
theory
according
to
which
the
elements
of
air
fire
and
water
were
originally
the
objects
of
religious
adoration
and
the
principal
deities
were
personifications
of
the
powers
of
nature
the
transition
was
easy
from
a
personification
of
the
elements
to
the
notion
of
supernatural
beings
presiding
over
and
governing
the
different
objects
of
nature
the
greeks
whose
imagination
was
lively
peopled
all
nature
with
invisible
beings
and
supposed
that
every
object
from
the
sun
and
sea
to
the
smallest
fountain
and
rivulet
was
under
the
care
of
some
particular
divinity
wordsworth
in
his
excursion
has
beautifully
developed
this
view
of
grecian
mythology
in
that
fair
clime
the
lonely
herdsman
stretched
on
the
soft
grass
through
half
a
summer
day
with
music
lulled
his
indolent
repose
and
in
some
fit
of
weariness
if
he
when
his
own
breath
was
silent
chanced
to
hear
a
distant
strain
far
sweeter
than
the
sounds
which
his
poor
skill
could
make
his
fancy
fetched
even
from
the
blazing
chariot
of
the
sun
a
beardless
youth
who
touched
a
golden
lute
and
filled
the
illumined
groves
with
ravishment
the
mighty
hunter
lifting
up
his
eyes
toward
the
crescent
moon
with
grateful
heart
called
on
the
lovely
wanderer
who
bestowed
that
timely
light
to
share
his
joyous
sport
and
hence
a
beaming
goddess
with
her
nymphs
across
the
lawn
and
through
the
darksome
grove
not
unaccompanied
with
tuneful
notes
by

swept
in
the

the
naiad

apace

these
were

or

all
the
theories
which
have
been
mentioned
are
true
to
a
certain
extent
it
would
therefore
be
more
correct
to
say
that
the
mythology
of
a
nation
has
sprung
from
all
these
sources
combined
than
from
any
one
in
particular
we
may
add
also
that
there
are
many
myths
which
have
arisen
from
the
desire
of
man
to
account
for
those
natural
phenomena
which
he
can
not
understand
and
not
a
few
have
had
their
rise
from
a
similar
desire
of
giving
a
reason
for
the
names
of
places
and
persons
statues
of
the
gods
to
adequately
represent
to
the
eye
the
ideas
intended
to
be
conveyed
to
the
mind
under
the
several
names
of
deities
was
a
task
which
called
into
exercise
the
highest
powers
of
genius
and
art
of
the
many
attempts
four
have
been
most
celebrated
the
first
two
known
to
us
only
by
the
descriptions
of
the
ancients
the
others
still
extant
and
the
acknowledged
masterpieces
of
the
art
the
olympian
jupiter
the
statue
of
the
olympian
jupiter
by
phidias
was
considered
the
highest
achievement
of
this
department
of
grecian
art
it
was
of
colossal
dimensions
and
was
what
the
ancients
called
chryselephantine
that
is
composed
of
ivory
and
gold
the
parts
representing
flesh
being
of
ivory
laid
on
a
core
of
wood
or
stone
while
the
drapery
and
other
ornaments
were
of
gold
the
height
of
the
figure
was
forty
feet
on
a
pedestal
twelve
feet
high
the
god
was
represented
seated
on
his
throne
his
brows
were
crowned
with
a
wreath
of
olive
and
he
held
in
his
right
hand
a
sceptre
and
in
his
left
a
statue
of
victory
the
throne
was
of
cedar
adorned
with
gold
and
precious
stones
the
idea
which
the
artist
essayed
to
embody
was
that
of
the
supreme
deity
of

under
the

was
also
the

it
stood
in

parthenon

temple
of
minerva
at
athens
the
goddess
was
represented
standing
in
one
hand
she
held
a
spear
in
the
other
a
statue
of
victory
her
helmet
highly
decorated
was
surmounted
by
a
sphinx
the
statue
was
forty
feet
in
height
and
like
the
jupiter
composed
of
ivory
and
gold
the
eyes
were
of
marble
and
probably
painted
to
represent
the
iris
and
pupil
the
parthenon
in
which
this
statue
stood
was
also
constructed
under
the
direction
and
superintendence
of
phidias
its
exterior
was
enriched
with
sculptures
many
of
them
from
the
hand
of
phidias
the
elgin
marbles
now
in
the
british
museum
are
a
part
of
them
both
the
jupiter
and
minerva
of
phidias
are
lost
but
there
is
good
ground
to
believe
that
we
have
in
several
extant
statues
and
busts
the
artist
conceptions
of
the
countenances
of
both
they
are
characterized
by
grave
and
dignified
beauty
and
freedom
from
any
transient
expression
which
in
the
language
of
art
is
called
repose
the
venus
de
medici
the
venus
of
the
medici
is
so
called
from
its
having
been
in
the
possession
of
the
princes
of
that
name
in
rome
when
it
first
attracted
attention
about
two
hundred
years
ago
an
inscription
on
the
base
records
it
to
be
the
work
of
cleomenes
an
athenian
sculptor
of
but
the
authenticity
of
the
inscription
is
doubtful
there
is
a
story
that
the
artist
was
employed
by
public
authority
to
make
a
statue
exhibiting
the
perfection
of
female
beauty
and
to
aid
him
in
his
task
the
most
perfect
forms
the
city
could
supply
were
furnished
him
for
models
it
is
this
which
thomson
alludes
to
in
his
summer
so
stands
the
statue
that
enchants
the
world
so
bending
tries
to

the
matchless
boast

byron
also
alludes
to
this

speaking
of

says
there

the
most

of
all
the

the
name
of
the
apartment
of
the

palace
at

in
which
it
was
placed
the

it
is
supposed
to
be
a
work
of
roman
art
of
about
the
first
century
of

for
the

which
is
fastened
around

the

the

much
resembles
that
of

the
sizes
correspond
and
also
the
style
of

it
is
a
work
of
the
highest
order

by
no

equal
to

the
poets
of
mythology
homer
from
whose
poems
of
the
iliad
and
odyssey
we
have
taken
the
chief
part
of
our
chapters
of
the
trojan
war
and
the
return
of
the
grecians
is
almost
as
mythical
a
personage
as
the
heroes
he
celebrates
the
traditionary
story
is
that
he
was
a
wandering
minstrel
blind
and
old
who
travelled
from
place
to
place
singing
his
lays
to
the
music
of
his
harp
in
the
courts
of
princes
or
the
cottages
of
peasants
and
dependent
upon
the
voluntary
offerings
of
his
hearers
for
support
byron
calls
him
the
blind
old
man
of
scio
rocky
isle
and
a
epigram
alluding
to
the
uncertainty
of
the
fact
of
his
birthplace
says
seven
wealthy
towns
contend
for
homer
dead
through
which
the
living
homer
begged
his
bread
these
seven
were
smyrna
scio
rhodes
colophon
salamis
argos
and
athens
modern
scholars
have
doubted
whether
the
homeric
poems
are
the
work
of
any
single
mind
this
arises
from
the
difficulty
of
believing
that
poems
of
such
length
could
have
been
committed
to
writing
at
so
early
an
age
as
that
usually
assigned
to
these
an
age
earlier
than
the
date
of
any
remaining
inscriptions
or
coins
and
when
no
materials
capable
of
containing
such
long
productions
were
yet
introduced
into
use
on
the
other
hand
it
is
asked
how
poems
of
such
length
could
have
been
handed
down
from
age
to
age
by
means
of
the
memory
alone
this
is
answered
by
the
statement
that
there
was
a
professional
body
of
men
called
rhapsodists
who
recited
the
poems
of
others
and
whose
business
it
was
to
commit
to
memory
and
rehearse
for
pay
the
national
and
patriotic
legends
the
prevailing
opinion
of
the
learned
at
this
time
seems
to
be
that
the
framework
and
much
of
the
structure
of
the
poems
belong
to
homer
but
that
there
are
numerous
interpolations
and
additions
by
other
hands
the
date
assigned
to
homer
on
the
authority
of
herodotus
is
virgil
virgil
called
also
by
his
surname
maro
from
whose
poem
of
the
aeneid
we
have
taken
the
story
of
aeneas
was
one
of
the
great
poets
who
made
the
reign
of
the
roman
emperor
augustus
so
celebrated
under
the
name
of
the
augustan
age
virgil
was
born
in
mantua
in
the
year
his
great
poem
is
ranked
next
to
those
of
homer
in
the
highest
class
of
poetical
composition
the
epic
virgil
is
far
inferior
to
homer
in
originality
and
invention
but
superior
to
him
in
correctness
and
elegance
to
critics
of
english
lineage
milton
alone
of
modern
poets
seems
worthy
to
be
classed
with
these
illustrious
ancients
his
poem
of
paradise
lost
from
which
we
have
borrowed
so
many
illustrations
is
in
many
respects
equal
in
some
superior
to
either
of
the
great
works
of
antiquity
the
following
epigram
of
dryden
characterizes
the
three
poets
with
as
much
truth
as
it
is
usual
to
find
in
such
pointed
criticism
on

ovid
ovid
often
alluded
to
in
poetry
by
his
other
name
of
naso
was
born
in
the
year
he
was
educated
for
public
life
and
held
some
offices
of
considerable
dignity
but
poetry
was
his
delight
and
he
early
resolved
to
devote
himself
to
it
he
accordingly
sought
the
society
of
the
contemporary
poets
and
was
acquainted
with
horace
and
saw
virgil
though
the
latter
died
when
ovid
was
yet
too
young
and
undistinguished
to
have
formed
his
acquaintance
ovid
spent
an
easy
life
at
rome
in
the
enjoyment
of
a
competent
income
he
was
intimate
with
the
family
of
augustus
the
emperor
and
it
is
supposed
that
some
serious
offence
given
to
some
member
of
that
family
was
the
cause
of
an
event
which
reversed
the
happy
circumstances
and
clouded
all
the
latter
portion
of
his
life
at
the
age
of
fifty
he
was
banished
from
rome
and
ordered
to
betake
himself
to
tomi
on
the
borders
of
the
black
sea
here
among
the
barbarous
people
and
in
a
severe
climate
the
poet
who
had
been
accustomed
to
all
the
pleasures
of
a
luxurious
capital
and
the
society
of
his
most
distinguished
contemporaries
spent
the
last
ten
years
of
his
life
worn
out
with
grief
and
anxiety
his
only
consolation
in
exile
was
to
address
his
wife
and
absent
friends
and
his
letters
were
all
poetical
though
these
poems
the
trista
and
letters
from
pontus
have
no
other
topic
than
the
poet
sorrows
his
exquisite
taste
and
fruitful
invention
have
redeemed
them
from
the
charge
of
being
tedious
and
they
are
read
with
pleasure
and
even
with
sympathy
the
two
great
works
of
ovid
are
his
metamorphoses
and
his
fasti
they
are
both
mythological
poems
and
from
the
former
we
have
taken
most
of
our
stories
of
grecian
and
roman
mythology
a
late
writer
thus
characterizes
these
poems
the
rich
mythology
of
greece
furnished

as
it
may
still
furnish
the
poet
the
painter
and
the
sculptor
with
materials
for
his
art
with
exquisite
taste
simplicity
and
pathos
he
has
narrated
the
fabulous
traditions
of
early
ages
and
given
to
them
that
appearance
of
reality
which
only
a
master
hand
could
impart
his
pictures
of
nature
are
striking
and
true
he
selects
with
care
that
which
is
appropriate
he
rejects
the
superfluous
and
when
he
has
completed
his
work
it
is
neither
defective
nor
redundant
the
are
read
with
pleasure
by
youth
and
are
in
more
advanced
age
with
still
greater
delight
the
poet
ventured
to
predict
that
his
poem
would
survive
him
and
be
read
wherever
the
roman
name
was
known
the
prediction
above
alluded
to
is

they
are
mentioned
perhaps
by
the
classical
writers
but
their
chief
popularity
and
currency
seem
to
have
been
in
more
modern
times
we
seek
our
accounts
of
them
not
so
much
in
the
poetry
of
the
ancients
as
in
the
old
natural
history
books
and
narrations
of
travellers
the
accounts
which
we
are
about
to
give
are
taken
chiefly
from
the
penny
cyclopedia
the
phoenix
ovid
tells
the
story
of
the
phoenix
as
follows
most
beings
spring
from
other
individuals
but
there
is
a
certain
kind
which
reproduces
itself
the
assyrians
call
it
the
phoenix
it
does
not
live
on
fruit
or
flowers
but
on
frankincense
and
odoriferous
gums
when
it
has
lived
five
hundred
years
it
builds
itself
a
nest
in
the
branches
of
an
oak
or
on
the
top
of
a
palm
tree
in
this
it
collects
cinnamon
and
spikenard
and
myrrh
and
of
these
materials
builds
a
pile
on
which
it
deposits
itself
and
dying
breathes
out
its
last
breath
amidst
odors
from
the
body
of
the
parent
bird
a
young
phoenix
issues
forth
destined
to
live
as
long
a
life
as
its
predecessor
when
this
has
grown
up
and
gained
sufficient
strength
it
lifts
its
nest
from
the
tree
its
own
cradle
and
its
parent
sepulchre
and
carries
it
to
the
city
of
heliopolis
in
egypt
and
deposits
it
in
the
temple
of
the
sun
such
is
the
account
given
by
a
poet
now
let
us
see
that
of
a
philosophic
historian
tacitus
says
in
the
consulship
of
paulus
fabius
the
miraculous
bird
known
to
the
world
by
the
name
of
the
phoenix
after
disappearing
for
a
series
of
ages
revisited
egypt
it
was
attended
in
its
flight
by
a
group
of
various
birds
all
attracted
by
the
novelty
and
gazing
with
wonder
at
so
beautiful
an
appearance
he
then
gives
an
account
of
the
bird
not
varying
materially
from
the
preceding
but
adding
some
details
the
first
care
of
the
young
bird
as
soon
as
fledged
and
able
to
trust
to
his
wings
is
to
perform
the
obsequies
of
his
father
but
this
duty
is
not
undertaken
rashly
he
collects
a
quantity
of
myrrh
and
to
try
his
strength
makes
frequent
excursions
with
a
load
on
his
back
when
he
has
gained
sufficient
confidence
in
his
own
vigor
he
takes
up
the
body
of
his
father
and
flies
with
it
to
the
altar
of
the
sun
where
he
leaves
it
to
be
consumed
in
flames
of
fragrance
other
writers
add
a
few
particulars
the
myrrh
is
compacted
in
the
form
of
an
egg
in
which
the
dead
phoenix
is
enclosed
from
the
mouldering
flesh
of
the
dead
bird
a
worm
springs
and
this
worm
when
grown
large
is
transformed
into
a
bird
herodotus
describes
the
bird
though
he
says
i
have
not
seen
it
myself
except
in
a
picture
part
of
his
plumage
is
and
part
crimson
and
he
is
for
the
most
part
very
much
like
an
eagle
in
outline
and
bulk
the
first
writer
who
disclaimed
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
the
phoenix
was
sir
thomas
browne
in
his
vulgar
errors
published
in
he
was
replied
to
a
few
years
later
by
alexander
ross
who
says
in
answer
to
the
objection
of
the
phoenix
so
seldom
making
his
appearance
his
instinct
teaches
him
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
tyrant
of
the
creation
man
for
if
he
were
to
be
got
at
some
wealthy
glutton
would
surely
devour
him
though

he
flies
the
cockatrice
or
basilisk
this
animal
was
called
the
king
of
the
serpents
in
confirmation
of
his
royalty
he
was
said
to
be
endowed
with
a
crest
or
comb
upon
the
head
constituting
a
crown
he
was
supposed
to
be
produced
from
the
egg
of
a
cock
hatched
under
toads
or
serpents
there
were
several
species
of
this
animal
one
species
burned
up
whatever
they
approached
a
second
were
a
kind
of
wandering
medusa
heads
and
their
look
caused
an
instant
horror
which
was
immediately
followed
by
death
in

the
third
lady
anne
in
answer
to
richard
compliment
on
her

says
would
they
were
basilisk
to
strike
thee
dead
the
basilisks
were
called
kings
of
serpents
because
all
other
serpents
and
snakes
behaving
like
good
subjects
and
wisely
not
wishing
to
be
burned
up
or
struck
dead
fled
the
moment
they
heard
the
distant
hiss
of
their
king
although
they
might
be
in
full
feed
upon
the
most
delicious
prey
leaving
the
sole
enjoyment
of
the
banquet
to
the
royal
monster
the
roman
naturalist
pliny
thus
describes
him
he
does
not
impel
his
body
like
other
serpents
by
a
multiplied
flexion
but
advances
lofty
and
upright
he
kills
the
shrubs
not
only
by
contact
but
by
breathing
on
them
and
splits
the
rocks
such
power
of
evil
is
there
in
him
it
was
formerly
believed
that
if
killed
by
a
spear
from
on
horseback
the
power
of
the
poison
conducted
through
the
weapon
killed
not
only
the
rider
but
the
horse
also
to
this
lucan
alludes
in
these
lines
what
though
the
moor
the
basilisk
hath
slain
and
pinned
him
lifeless
to
the
sandy
plain
up
through
the
spear
the
subtle
venom
flies
the
hand
imbibes
it
and
the
victor
dies
such
a
prodigy
was
not
likely
to
be
passed
over
in
the
legends
of
the
saints
accordingly
we
find
it
recorded
that
a
certain
holy
man
going
to
a
fountain
in
the
desert
suddenly
beheld
a
basilisk
he
immediately
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
with
a
pious
appeal
to
the
deity
laid
the
monster
dead
at
his
feet
these
wonderful
powers
of
the
basilisk
are
attested
by
a
host
of
learned
persons
such
as
galen
avicenna
scaliger
and
others
occasionally
one
would
demur
to
some
part
of
the
tale
while
he
admitted
the
rest
jonston
a
learned
physician
sagely
remarks
i
would
scarcely
believe
that
it
kills
with
its
look
for
who
could
have
seen
it
and
lived
to
tell
the
story
the
worthy
sage
was
not
aware
that
those
who
went
to
hunt
the
basilisk
of
this
sort
took
with
them
a
mirror
which
reflected
back
the
deadly
glare
upon
its
author
and
by
a
kind
of
poetical
justice
slew
the
basilisk
with
his
own
weapon
but
what
was
to
attack
this
terrible
and
unapproachable
monster
there
is
an
old
saying
that
everything
has
its
enemy
and
the
cockatrice
quailed
before
the
weasel
the
basilisk
might
look
daggers
the
weasel
cared
not
but
advanced
boldly
to
the
conflict
when
bitten
the
weasel
retired
for
a
moment
to
eat
some
rue
which
was
the
only
plant
the
basilisks
could
not
wither
returned
with
renewed
strength
and
soundness
to
the
charge
and
never
left
the
enemy
till
he
was
stretched
dead
on
the
plain
the
monster
too
as
if
conscious
of
the
irregular
way
in
which
he
came
into
the
world
was
supposed
to
have
a
great
antipathy
to
a
cock
and
well
he
might
for
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
cock
crow
he
expired
the
basilisk
was
of
some
use
after
death
thus
we
read
that
its
carcass
was
suspended
in
the
temple
of
apollo
and
in
private
houses
as
a
sovereign
remedy
against
spiders
and
that
it
was
also
hung
up
in
the
temple
of
diana
for
which
reason
no
swallow
ever
dared
enter
the
sacred
place
the
reader
will
we
apprehend
by
this
time
have
had
enough
of
absurdities
but
still
we
can
imagine
his
anxiety
to
know
what
a
cockatrice
was
like
the
following
is
from
aldrovandus
a
celebrated
naturalist
of
the
sixteenth
century
whose
work
on
natural
history
in
thirteen
folio
volumes
contains
with
much
that
is
valuable
a
large
proportion
of
fables
and
inutilities
in
particular
he
is
so
ample
on
the
subject
of
the
cock
and
the
bull
that
from
his
practice
all
rambling
gossiping
tales
of
doubtful
credibility
are
called
cock
and
bull
stories
aldrovandus
however
deserves
our
respect
and
esteem
as
the
founder
of
a
botanic
garden
and
as
a
pioneer
in
the
now
prevalent
custom
of
making
scientific
collections
for
purposes
of
investigation
and
research
shelley
in
his
ode
to
naples
full
of
the
enthusiasm
excited
by
the
intelligence
of
the
proclamation
of
a
constitutional
government
at
naples
in
thus
uses
an
allusion
to
the
basilisk

though
cimmerian
anarchs
dare
blaspheme

and

more

gazing
on
their

the
unicorn
pliny
the
roman
naturalist
out
of
whose
account
of
the
unicorn
most
of
the
modern
unicorns
have
been
described
and
figured
records
it
as
a
very
ferocious
beast
similar
in
the
rest
of
its
body
to
a
horse
with
the
head
of
a
deer
the
feet
of
an
elephant
the
tail
of
a
boar
a
deep
bellowing
voice
and
a
single
black
horn
two
cubits
in
length
standing
out
in
the
middle
of
its
forehead
he
adds
that
it
can
not
be
taken
alive
and
some
such
excuse
may
have
been
necessary
in
those
days
for
not
producing
the
living
animal
upon
the
arena
of
the
amphitheatre
the
unicorn
seems
to
have
been
a
sad
puzzle
to
the
hunters
who
hardly
knew
how
to
come
at
so
valuable
a
piece
of
game
some
described
the
horn
as
movable
at
the
will
of
the
animal
a
kind
of
small
sword
in
short
with
which
no
hunter
who
was
not
exceedingly
cunning
in
fence
could
have
a
chance
others
maintained
that
all
the
animal
strength
lay
in
its
horn
and
that
when
hard
pressed
in
pursuit
it
would
throw
itself
from
the
pinnacle
of
the
highest
rocks
horn
foremost
so
as
to
pitch
upon
it
and
then
quietly
march
off
not
a
whit
the
worse
for
its
fall
but
it
seems
they
found
out
how
to
circumvent
the
poor
unicorn
at
last
they
discovered
that
it
was
a
great
lover
of
purity
and
innocence
so
they
took
the
field
with
a
young
virgin
who
was
placed
in
the
unsuspecting
admirer
way
when
the
unicorn
spied
her
he
approached
with
all
reverence
couched
beside
her
and
laying
his
head
in
her
lap
fell
asleep
the
treacherous
virgin
then
gave
a
signal
and
the
hunters
made
in
and
captured
the
simple
beast
modern
zoologists
disgusted
as
they
well
may
be
with
such
fables
as
these
disbelieve
generally
the
existence
of
the
unicorn
yet
there
are
animals
bearing
on
their
heads
a
bony
protuberance
more
or
less
like
a
horn
which
may
have
given
rise
to
the
story
the
rhinoceros
horn
as
it
is
called
is
such
a
protuberance
though
it
does
not
exceed
a
few
inches
in
height
and
is
far
from
agreeing
with
the
descriptions
of
the
horn
of
the
unicorn
the
nearest
approach
to
a
horn
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
is
exhibited
in
the
bony
protuberance
on
the
forehead
of
the
giraffe
but
this
also
is
short
and
blunt
and
is
not
the
only
horn
of
the
animal
but
a
third
horn
standing
in
front
of
the
two
others
in
fine
though
it
would
be
presumptuous
to
deny
the
existence
of
a
quadruped
other
than
the
rhinoceros
it
may
be
safely
stated
that
the
insertion
of
a
long
and
solid
horn
in
the
living
forehead
of
a
or
animal
is
as
near
an
impossibility
as
anything
can
be
the
salamander
the
following
is
from
the
life
of
benvenuto
cellini
an
italian
artist
of
the
sixteenth
century
written
by
himself
when
i
was
about
five
years
of
age
my
father
happening
to
be
in
a
little
room
in
which
they
had
been
washing
and
where
there
was
a
good
fire
of
oak
burning
looked
into
the
flames
and
saw
a
little
animal
resembling
a
lizard
which
could
live
in
the
hottest
part
of
that
element
instantly
perceiving
what
it
was
he
called
for
my
sister
and
me
and
after
he
had
shown
us
the
creature
he
gave
me
a
box
on
the
ear
i
fell
while
he
soothing
me
with
caresses
spoke
these
words
dear
child
i
do
not
give
you
that
blow
for
any
fault
you
have
committed
but
that
you
may
recollect
that
the
little
creature
you
see
in
the
fire
is
a
salamander
such
a
one
as
never
was
beheld
before
to
my
knowledge
so
saying
he
embraced
me
and
gave
me
some
money
it
seems
unreasonable
to
doubt
a
story
of
which
signor
cellini
was
both
an
eye
and
ear
witness
add
to
which
the
authority
of
numerous
sage
philosophers
at
the
head
of
whom
are
aristotle
and
pliny
affirms
this
power
of
the
salamander
according
to
them
the
animal
not
only
resists
fire
but
extinguishes
it
and
when
he
sees
the
flame
charges
it
as
an
enemy
which
he
well
knows
how
to
vanquish
that
the
skin
of
an
animal
which
could
resist
the
action
of
fire
should
be
considered
proof
against
that
element
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
we
accordingly
find
that
a
cloth
made
of
the
skin
of
salamanders
for
there
really
is
such
an
animal
a
kind
of
lizard
was
incombustible
and
very
valuable
for
wrapping
up
such
articles
as
were
too
precious
to
be
intrusted
to
any
other
envelopes
these
cloths
were
actually
produced
said
to
be
made
of
salamander
wool
though
the
knowing
ones
detected
that
the
substance
of
which
they
were
composed
was
asbestos
a
mineral
which
is
in
fine
filaments
capable
of
being
woven
into
a
flexible
cloth
the
foundation
of
the
above
fables
is
supposed
to
be
the
fact
that
the
salamander
really
does
secrete
from
the
pores
of
his
body
a
milky
juice
which
when
he
is
irritated
is
produced
in
considerable
quantity
and
would
doubtless
for
a
few
moments
defend
the
body
from
fire
then
it
is
a
hibernating
animal
and
in
winter
retires
to
some
hollow
tree
or
other
cavity
where
it
coils
itself
up
and
remains
in
a
torpid
state
till
the
spring
again
calls
it
forth
it
may
therefore
sometimes
be
carried
with
the
fuel
to
the
fire
and
wake
up
only
time
enough
to
put
forth
all
its
faculties
for
its
defence
its
viscous
juice
would
do
good
service
and
all
who
profess
to
have
seen
it
acknowledge
that
it
got
out
of
the
fire
as
fast
as
its
legs
could
carry
it
indeed
too
fast
for
them
ever
to
make
prize
of
one
except
in
one
instance
and
in
that
one
the
animal
feet
and
some
parts
of
its
body
were
badly
burned
young
in
the
night
thoughts
with
more
quaintness
than
good
taste
compares
the
sceptic
who
can
remain
unmoved
in
the
contemplation
of
the
starry
heavens
to
a
salamander
unwarmed
in
the

zoroaster
our
knowledge
of
the
religion
of
the
ancient
persians
is
principally
derived
from
the
zendavesta
or
sacred
books
of
that
people
zoroaster
was
the
founder
of
their
religion
or
rather
the
reformer
of
the
religion
which
preceded
him
the
time
when
he
lived
is
doubtful
but
it
is
certain
that
his
system
became
the
dominant
religion
of
western
asia
from
the
time
of
cyrus
to
the
conquest
of
persia
by
alexander
the
great
under
the
macedonian
monarchy
the
doctrines
of
zoroaster
appear
to
have
been
considerably
corrupted
by
the
introduction
of
foreign
opinions
but
they
afterwards
recovered
their
ascendency
zoroaster
taught
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being
who
created
two
other
mighty
beings
and
imparted
to
them
as
much
of
his
own
nature
as
seemed
good
to
him
of
these
ormuzd
called
by
the
greeks
oromasdes
remained
faithful
to
his
creator
and
was
regarded
as
the
source
of
all
good
while
ahriman
arimanes
rebelled
and
became
the
author
of
all
evil
upon
the
earth
ormuzd
created
man
and
supplied
him
with
all
the
materials
of
happiness
but
ahriman
marred
this
happiness
by
introducing
evil
into
the
world
and
creating
savage
beasts
and
poisonous
reptiles
and
plants
in
consequence
of
this
evil
and
good
are
now
mingled
together
in
every
part
of
the
world
and
the
followers
of
good
and
evil
the
adherents
of
ormuzd
and
ahriman
carry
on
incessant
war
but
this
state
of
things
will
not
last
forever
the
time
will
come
when
the
adherents
of
ormuzd
shall
everywhere
be
victorious
and
ahriman
and
his
followers
be
consigned
to
darkness
forever
the
religious
rites
of
the
ancient
persians
were
exceedingly
simple
they
used
neither
temples
altars
nor
statues
and
performed
their
sacrifices
on
the
tops
of
mountains
they
adored
fire
light
and
the
sun
as
emblems
of
ormuzd
the
source
of
all
light
and
purity
but
did
not
regard
them
as
independent
deities
the
religious
rites
and
ceremonies
were
regulated
by
the
priests
who
were
called
magi
the
learning
of
the
magi
was
connected
with
astrology
and
enchantment
in
which
they
were
so
celebrated
that
their
name
was
applied
to
all
orders
of
magicians
and
enchanters
wordsworth
thus
alludes
to
the
worship
of
the
persians
the
persian
zealous
to
reject

and

and
the
inclusive
walls
and
roofs
of

of

excursion
book
iv
in
childe
harold
byron
speaks
thus
of
the
persian
worship
not
vainly
did
the
early
persian
make
his
altar
the
high
places
and
the
peak
of
mountains
and
thus
take
a
fit
and
unwalled
temple
there
to
seek
the

in

to
circumscribe
thy
prayer
the
religion
of
zoroaster
continued
to
flourish
even
after
the
introduction
of
christianity
and
in
the
third
century
was
the
dominant
faith
of
the
east
till
the
rise
of
the
mahometan
power
and
the
conquest
of
persia
by
the
arabs
in
the
seventh
century
who
compelled
the
greater
number
of
the
persians
to
renounce
their
ancient
faith
those
who
refused
to
abandon
the
religion
of
their
ancestors
fled
to

hindu
mythology
the
religion
of
the
hindus
is
professedly
founded
on
the
vedas
to
these
books
of
their
scripture
they
attach
the
greatest
sanctity
and
state
that
brahma
himself
composed
them
at
the
creation
but
the
present
arrangement
of
the
vedas
is
attributed
to
the
sage
vyasa
about
five
thousand
years
ago
the
vedas
undoubtedly
teach
the
belief
of
one
supreme
god
the
name
of
this
deity
is
brahma
his
attributes
are
represented
by
the
three
personified
powers
of
creation
preservation
and
destruction
which
under
the
respective
names
of
brahma
vishnu
and
siva
form
the
trimurti
or
triad
of
principal
hindu
gods
of
the
inferior
gods
the
most
important
are
indra
the
god
of
heaven
of
thunder
lightning
storm
and
rain
agni
the
god
of
fire
yama
the
god
of
the
infernal
regions
surya
the
god
of
the
sun
brahma
is
the
creator
of
the
universe
and
the
source
from
which
all
the
individual
deities
have
sprung
and
into
which
all
will
ultimately
be
absorbed
as
milk
changes
to
curd
and
water
to
ice
so
is
brahma
variously
transformed
and
diversified
without
aid
of
exterior
means
of
any
sort
the
human
soul
according
to
the
vedas
is
a
portion
of
the
supreme
ruler
as
a
spark
is
of
the
fire
vishnu
vishnu
occupies
the
second
place
in
the
triad
of
the
hindus
and
is
the
personification
of
the
preserving
principle
to
protect
the
world
in
various
epochs
of
danger
vishnu
descended
to
the
earth
in
different
incarnations
or
bodily
forms
which
descents
are
called
avatars
they
are
very
numerous
but
ten
are
more
particularly
specified
the
first
avatar
was
as
matsya
the
fish
under
which
form
vishnu
preserved
manu
the
ancestor
of
the
human
race
during
a
universal
deluge
the
second
avatar
was
in
the
form
of
a
tortoise
which
form
he
assumed
to
support
the
earth
when
the
gods
were
churning
the
sea
for
the
beverage
of
immortality
amrita
we
may
omit
the
other
avatars
which
were
of
the
same
general
character
that
is
interpositions
to
protect
the
right
or
to
punish
and
come
to
the
ninth
which
is
the
most
celebrated
of
the
avatars
of
vishnu
in
which
he
appeared
in
the
human
form
of
krishna
an
invincible
warrior
who
by
his
exploits
relieved
the
earth
from
the
tyrants
who
oppressed
it
buddha
is
by
the
followers
of
the
brahmanical
religion
regarded
as
a
delusive
incarnation
of
vishnu
assumed
by
him
in
order
to
induce
the
asuras
opponents
of
the
gods
to
abandon
the
sacred
ordinances
of
the
vedas
by
which
means
they
lost
their
strength
and
supremacy
kalki
is
the
name
of
the
tenth
avatar
in
which
vishnu
will
appear
at
the
end
of
the
present
age
of
the
world
to
destroy
all
vice
and
wickedness
and
to
restore
mankind
to
virtue
and
purity
siva
siva
is
the
third
person
of
the
hindu
triad
he
is
the
personification
of
the
destroying
principle
though
the
third
name
he
is
in
respect
to
the
number
of
his
worshippers
and
the
extension
of
his
worship
before
either
of
the
others
in
the
puranas
the
scriptures
of
the
modern
hindu
religion
no
allusion
is
made
to
the
original
power
of
this
god
as
a
destroyer
that
power
not
being
to
be
called
into
exercise
till
after
the
expiration
of
twelve
millions
of
years
or
when
the
universe
will
come
to
an
end
and
mahadeva
another
name
for
siva
is
rather
the
representative
of
regeneration
than
of
destruction
the
worshippers
of
vishnu
and
siva
form
two
sects
each
of
which
proclaims
the
superiority
of
its
favorite
deity
denying
the
claims
of
the
other
and
brahma
the
creator
having
finished
his
work
seems
to
be
regarded
as
no
longer
active
and
has
now
only
one
temple
in
india
while
mahadeva
and
vishnu
have
many
the
worshippers
of
vishnu
are
generally
distinguished
by
a
greater
tenderness
for
life
and
consequent
abstinence
from
animal
food
and
a
worship
less
cruel
than
that
of
the
followers
of
siva
juggernaut
whether
the
worshippers
of
juggernaut
are
to
be
reckoned
among
the
followers
of
vishnu
or
siva
our
authorities
differ
the
temple
stands
near
the
shore
about
three
hundred
miles
of
calcutta
the
idol
is
a
carved
block
of
wood
with
a
hideous
face
painted
black
and
a
distended
mouth
on
festival
days
the
throne
of
the
image
is
placed
on
a
tower
sixty
feet
high
moving
on
wheels
six
long
ropes
are
attached
to
the
tower
by
which
the
people
draw
it
along
the
priests
and
their
attendants
stand
round
the
throne
on
the
tower
and
occasionally
turn
to
the
worshippers
with
songs
and
gestures
while
the
tower
moves
along
numbers
of
the
devout
worshippers
throw
themselves
on
the
ground
in
order
to
be
crushed
by
the
wheels
and
the
multitude
shout
in
approbation
of
the
act
as
a
pleasing
sacrifice
to
the
idol
every
year
particularly
at
two
great
festivals
in
march
and
july
pilgrims
flock
in
crowds
to
the
temple
not
less
than
seventy
or
eighty
thousand
people
are
said
to
visit
the
place
on
these
occasions
when
all
castes
eat
together
castes
the
division
of
the
hindus
into
classes
or
castes
with
fixed
occupations
existed
from
the
earliest
times
it
is
supposed
by
some
to
have
been
founded
upon
conquest
the
first
three
castes
being
composed
of
a
foreign
race
who
subdued
the
natives
of
the
country
and
reduced
them
to
an
inferior
caste
others
trace
it
to
the
fondness
of
perpetuating
by
descent
from
father
to
son
certain
offices
or
occupations
the
hindu
tradition
gives
the
following
account
of
the
origin
of
the
various
castes
at
the
creation
brahma
resolved
to
give
the
earth
inhabitants
who
should
be
direct
emanations
from
his
own
body
accordingly
from
his
mouth
came
forth
the
eldest
born
brahma
the
priest
to
whom
he
confided
the
four
vedas
from
his
right
arm
issued
shatriya
the
warrior
and
from
his
left
the
warrior
wife
his
thighs
produced
vaissyas
male
and
female
agriculturists
and
traders
and
lastly
from
his
feet
sprang
sudras
mechanics
and
laborers
the
four
sons
of
brahma
so
significantly
brought
into
the
world
became
the
fathers
of
the
human
race
and
heads
of
their
respective
castes
they
were
commanded
to
regard
the
four
vedas
as
containing
all
the
rules
of
their
faith
and
all
that
was
necessary
to
guide
them
in
their
religious
ceremonies
they
were
also
commanded
to
take
rank
in
the
order
of
their
birth
the
brahmans
uppermost
as
having
sprung
from
the
head
of
brahma
a
strong
line
of
demarcation
is
drawn
between
the
first
three
castes
and
the
sudras
the
former
are
allowed
to
receive
instruction
from
the
vedas
which
is
not
permitted
to
the
sudras
the
brahmans
possess
the
privilege
of
teaching
the
vedas
and
were
in
former
times
in
exclusive
possession
of
all
knowledge
though
the
sovereign
of
the
country
was
chosen
from
the
shatriya
class
also
called
rajputs
the
brahmans
possessed
the
real
power
and
were
the
royal
counsellors
the
judges
and
magistrates
of
the
country
their
persons
and
property
were
inviolable
and
though
they
committed
the
greatest
crimes
they
could
only
be
banished
from
the
kingdom
they
were
to
be
treated
by
sovereigns
with
the
greatest
respect
for
a
brahman
whether
learned
or
ignorant
is
a
powerful
divinity
when
the
brahman
arrives
at
years
of
maturity
it
becomes
his
duty
to
marry
he
ought
to
be
supported
by
the
contributions
of
the
rich
and
not
to
be
obliged
to
gain
his
subsistence
by
any
laborious
or
productive
occupation
but
as
all
the
brahmans
could
not
be
maintained
by
the
working
classes
of
the
community
it
was
found
necessary
to
allow
them
to
engage
in
productive
employments
we
need
say
little
of
the
two
intermediate
classes
whose
rank
and
privileges
may
be
readily
inferred
from
their
occupations
the
sudras
or
fourth
class
are
bound
to
servile
attendance
on
the
higher
classes
especially
the
brahmans
but
they
may
follow
mechanical
occupations
and
practical
arts
as
painting
and
writing
or
become
traders
or
husbandmen
consequently
they
sometimes
grow
rich
and
it
will
also
sometimes
happen
that
brahmans
become
poor
that
fact
works
its
usual
consequence
and
rich
sudras
sometimes
employ
poor
brahmans
in
menial
occupations
there
is
another
class
lower
even
than
the
sudras
for
it
is
not
one
of
the
original
pure
classes
but
springs
from
an
unauthorized
union
of
individuals
of
different
castes
these
are
the
pariahs
who
are
employed
in
the
lowest
services
and
treated
with
the
utmost
severity
they
are
compelled
to
do
what
no
one
else
can
do
without
pollution
they
are
not
only
considered
unclean
themselves
but
they
render
unclean
everything
they
touch
they
are
deprived
of
all
civil
rights
and
stigmatized
by
particular
laws
regulating
their
mode
of
life
their
houses
and
their
furniture
they
are
not
allowed
to
visit
the
pagodas
or
temples
of
the
other
castes
but
have
their
own
pagodas
and
religious
exercises
they
are
not
suffered
to
enter
the
houses
of
the
other
castes
if
it
is
done
incautiously
or
from
necessity
the
place
must
be
purified
by
religious
ceremonies
they
must
not
appear
at
public
markets
and
are
confined
to
the
use
of
particular
wells
which
they
are
obliged
to
surround
with
bones
of
animals
to
warn
others
against
using
them
they
dwell
in
miserable
hovels
distant
from
cities
and
villages
and
are
under
no
restrictions
in
regard
to
food
which
last
is
not
a
privilege
but
a
mark
of
ignominy
as
if
they
were
so
degraded
that
nothing
could
pollute
them
the
three
higher
castes
are
prohibited
entirely
the
use
of
flesh
the
fourth
is
allowed
to
use
all
kinds
except
beef
but
only
the
lowest
caste
is
allowed
every
kind
of
food
without
restriction
buddha
buddha
whom
the
vedas
represent
as
a
delusive
incarnation
of
vishnu
is
said
by
his
followers
to
have
been
a
mortal
sage
whose
name
was
gautama
called
also
by
the
complimentary
epithets
of
sakyasinha
the
lion
and
buddha
the
sage
by
a
comparison
of
the
various
epochs
assigned
to
his
birth
it
is
inferred
that
he
lived
about
one
thousand
years
before
christ
he
was
the
son
of
a
king
and
when
in
conformity
to
the
usage
of
the
country
he
was
a
few
days
after
his
birth
presented
before
the
altar
of
a
deity
the
image
is
said
to
have
inclined
its
head
as
a
presage
of
the
future
greatness
of
the
prophet
the
child
soon
developed
faculties
of
the
first
order
and
became
equally
distinguished
by
the
uncommon
beauty
of
his
person
no
sooner
had
he
grown
to
years
of
maturity
than
he
began
to
reflect
deeply
on
the
depravity
and
misery
of
mankind
and
he
conceived
the
idea
of
retiring
from
society
and
devoting
himself
to
meditation
his
father
in
vain
opposed
this
design
buddha
escaped
the
vigilance
of
his
guards
and
having
found
a
secure
retreat
lived
for
six
years
undisturbed
in
his
devout
contemplations
at
the
expiration
of
that
period
he
came
forward
at
benares
as
a
religious
teacher
at
first
some
who
heard
him
doubted
of
the
soundness
of
his
mind
but
his
doctrines
soon
gained
credit
and
were
propagated
so
rapidly
that
buddha
himself
lived
to
see
them
spread
all
over
india
he
died
at
the
age
of
eighty
years
the
buddhists
reject
entirely
the
authority
of
the
vedas
and
the
religious
observances
prescribed
in
them
and
kept
by
the
hindus
they
also
reject
the
distinction
of
castes
and
prohibit
all
bloody
sacrifices
and
allow
animal
food
their
priests
are
chosen
from
all
classes
they
are
expected
to
procure
their
maintenance
by
perambulation
and
begging
and
among
other
things
it
is
their
duty
to
endeavor
to
turn
to
some
use
things
thrown
aside
as
useless
by
others
and
to
discover
the
medicinal
power
of
plants
but
in
ceylon
three
orders
of
priests
are
recognized
those
of
the
highest
order
are
usually
men
of
high
birth
and
learning
and
are
supported
at
the
principal
temples
most
of
which
have
been
richly
endowed
by
the
former
monarchs
of
the
country
for
several
centuries
after
the
appearance
of
buddha
his
sect
seems
to
have
been
tolerated
by
the
brahmans
and
buddhism
appears
to
have
penetrated
the
peninsula
of
hindustan
in
every
direction
and
to
have
been
carried
to
ceylon
and
to
the
eastern
peninsula
but
afterwards
it
had
to
endure
in
india
a
persecution
which
ultimately
had
the
effect
of
entirely
abolishing
it
in
the
country
where
it
had
originated
but
to
scatter
it
widely
over
adjacent
countries
buddhism
appears
to
have
been
introduced
into
china
about
the
year
of
our
era
from
china
it
was
subsequently
extended
to
corea
japan
and
java
the
grand
lama
it
is
a
doctrine
alike
of
the
brahminical
hindus
and
of
the
buddhist
sect
that
the
confinement
of
the
human
soul
an
emanation
of
the
divine
spirit
in
a
human
body
is
a
state
of
misery
and
the
consequence
of
frailties
and
sins
committed
during
former
existences
but
they
hold
that
some
few
individuals
have
appeared
on
this
earth
from
time
to
time
not
under
the
necessity
of
terrestrial
existence
but
who
voluntarily
descended
to
the
earth
to
promote
the
welfare
of
mankind
these
individuals
have
gradually
assumed
the
character
of
reappearances
of
buddha
himself
in
which
capacity
the
line
is
continued
till
the
present
day
in
the
several
lamas
of
thibet
china
and
other
countries
where
buddhism
prevails
in
consequence
of
the
victories
of
gengis
khan
and
his
successors
the
lama
residing
in
thibet
was
raised
to
the
dignity
of
chief
pontiff
of
the
sect
a
separate
province
was
assigned
to
him
as
his
own
territory
and
besides
his
spiritual
dignity
he
became
to
a
limited
extent
a
temporal
monarch
he
is
styled
the
dalai
lama
the
first
christian
missionaries
who
proceeded
to
thibet
were
surprised
to
find
there
in
the
heart
of
asia
a
pontifical
court
and
several
other
ecclesiastical
institutions
resembling
those
of
the
roman
catholic
church
they
found
convents
for
priests
and
nuns
also
processions
and
forms
of
religious
worship
attended
with
much
pomp
and
splendor
and
many
were
induced
by
these
similarities
to
consider
lamaism
as
a
sort
of
degenerated
christianity
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
lamas
derived
some
of
these
practices
from
the
nestorian
christians
who
were
settled
in
tartary
when
buddhism
was
introduced
into
thibet
prester
john
an
early
account
communicated
probably
by
travelling
merchants
of
a
lama
or
spiritual
chief
among
the
tartars
seems
to
have
occasioned
in
europe
the
report
of
a
presbyter
or
prester
john
a
christian
pontiff
resident
in
upper
asia
the
pope
sent
a
mission
in
search
of
him
as
did
also
louis
ix
of
france
some
years
later
but
both
missions
were
unsuccessful
though
the
small
communities
of
nestorian
christians
which
they
did
find
served
to
keep
up
the
belief
in
europe
that
such
a
personage
did
exist
somewhere
in
the
east
at
last
in
the
fifteenth
century
a
portuguese
traveller
pedro
covilham
happening
to
hear
that
there
was
a
christian
prince
in
the
country
of
the
abessines
abyssinia
not

the

northern
mythology
the
stories
which
have
engaged
our
attention
thus
far
relate
to
the
mythology
of
southern
regions
but
there
is
another
branch
of
ancient
superstitions
which
ought
not
to
be
entirely
overlooked
especially
as
it
belongs
to
the
nations
from
which
we
through
our
english
ancestors
derive
our
origin
it
is
that
of
the
northern
nations
called
scandinavians
who
inhabited
the
countries
now
known
as
sweden
denmark
norway
and
iceland
these
mythological
records
are
contained
in
two
collections
called
the
eddas
of
which
the
oldest
is
in
poetry
and
dates
back
to
the
year
the
more
modern
or
prose
edda
being
of
the
date
of
according
to
the
eddas
there
was
once
no
heaven
above
nor
earth
beneath
but
only
a
bottomless
deep
and
a
world
of
mist
in
which
flowed
a
fountain
twelve
rivers
issued
from
this
fountain
and
when
they
had
flowed
far
from
their
source
they
froze
into
ice
and
one
layer
accumulating
over
another
the
great
deep
was
filled
up
southward
from
the
world
of
mist
was
the
world
of
light
from
this
flowed
a
warm
wind
upon
the
ice
and
melted
it
the
vapors
rose
in
the
air
and
formed
clouds
from
which
sprang
ymir
the
frost
giant
and
his
progeny
and
the
cow
audhumbla
whose
milk
afforded
nourishment
and
food
to
the
giant
the
cow
got
nourishment
by
licking
the
hoar
frost
and
salt
from
the
ice
while
she
was
one
day
licking
the
salt
stones
there
appeared
at
first
the
hair
of
a
man
on
the
second
day
the
whole
head
and
on
the
third
the
entire
form
endowed
with
beauty
agility
and
power
this
new
being
was
a
god
from
whom
and
his
wife
a
daughter
of
the
giant
race
sprang
the
three
brothers
odin
vili
and
ve
they
slew
the
giant
ymir
and
out
of
his
body
formed
the
earth
of
his
blood
the
seas
of
his
bones
the
mountains
of
his
hair
the
trees
of
his
skull
the
heavens
and
of
his
brain
clouds
charged
with
hail
and
snow
of
ymir
eyebrows
the
gods
formed
midgard
mid
earth
destined
to
become
the
abode
of
man
odin
then
regulated
the
periods
of
day
and
night
and
the
seasons
by
placing
in
the
heavens
the
sun
and
moon
and
appointing
to
them
their
respective
courses
as
soon
as
the
sun
began
to
shed
its
rays
upon
the
earth
it
caused
the
vegetable
world
to
bud
and
sprout
shortly
after
the
gods
had
created
the
world
they
walked
by
the
side
of
the
sea
pleased
with
their
new
work
but
found
that
it
was
still
incomplete
for
it
was
without
human
beings
they
therefore
took
an
ash
tree
and
made
a
man
out
of
it
and
they
made
a
woman
out
of
an
elder
and
called
the
man
aske
and
the
woman
embla
odin
then
gave
them
life
and
soul
vili
reason
and
motion
and
ve
bestowed
upon
them
the
senses
expressive
features
and
speech
midgard
was
then
given
them
as
their
residence
and
they
became
the
progenitors
of
the
human
race
the
mighty
ash
tree
ygdrasill
was
supposed
to
support
the
whole
universe
it
sprang
from
the
body
of
ymir
and
had
three
immense
roots
extending
one
into
asgard
the
dwelling
of
the
gods
the
other
into
jotunheim
the
abode
of
the
giants
and
the
third
to
niffleheim
the
regions
of
darkness
and
cold
by
the
side
of
each
of
these
roots
is
a
spring
from
which
it
is
watered
the
root
that
extends
into
asgard
is
carefully
tended
by
the
three
norns
goddesses
who
are
regarded
as
the
dispensers
of
fate
they
are
urdur
the
past
verdandi
the
present
skuld
the
future
the
spring
at
the
jotunheim
side
is
ymir
well
in
which
wisdom
and
wit
lie
hidden
but
that
of
niffleheim
feeds
the
adder
nidhogge
darkness
which
perpetually
gnaws
at
the
root
four
harts
run
across
the
branches
of
the
tree
and
bite
the
buds
they
represent
the
four
winds
under
the

when
he
tries
to
shake
off
its

the
name
of
the
abode
of
the

access
to
which
is
only
gained
by
crossing
the
bridge
bifrost
the
rainbow
asgard
consists
of
golden
and
silver
palaces
the
dwellings
of
the
gods
but
the
most
beautiful
of
these
is
valhalla
the
residence
of
odin
when
seated
on
his
throne
he
overlooks
all
heaven
and
earth
upon
his
shoulders
are
the
ravens
hugin
and
munin
who
fly
every
day
over
the
whole
world
and
on
their
return
report
to
him
all
they
have
seen
and
heard
at
his
feet
lie
his
two
wolves
geri
and
freki
to
whom
odin
gives
all
the
meat
that
is
set
before
him
for
he
himself
stands
in
no
need
of
food
mead
is
for
him
both
food
and
drink
he
invented
the
runic
characters
and
it
is
the
business
of
the
norns
to
engrave
the
runes
of
fate
upon
a
metal
shield

woden
as
it
sometimes
is
came
wednesday
the
name
of
the
fourth
day
of
the
week
odin
is
frequently
called
alfadur
but
this
name
is
sometimes
used
in
a
way
that
shows
that
the
scandinavians
had
an
idea
of
a
deity
superior
to
odin
uncreated
and
eternal
of
the
joys
of
valhalla
valhalla
is
the
great
hall
of
odin
wherein
he
feasts
with
his
chosen
heroes
all
those
who
have
fallen
bravely
in
battle
for
all
who
die
a
peaceful
death
are
excluded
the
flesh
of
the
boar
schrimnir
is
served
up
to
them
and
is
abundant
for
all
for
although
this
boar
is
cooked
every
morning
he
becomes
whole
again
every
night
for
drink
the
heroes
are
supplied
abundantly
with
mead
from
the
heidrum
when
the
heroes
are
not
feasting
they
amuse
themselves
with
fighting
every
day
they
ride
out
into
the
court
or
field
and
fight
until
they
cut
each
other
in
pieces
this
is
their
pastime
but
when
meal
time
comes
they
recover
from
their
wounds
and
return
to
feast
in
valhalla
the
valkyrie

warlike
virgins
mounted
upon

in

the

footnote
gray
ode
the
fatal
sisters
is
founded
on
this
superstition
of
thor
and
the
other
gods
thor
the
thunderer
odin
eldest
son
is
the
strongest
of
gods
and
men
and
possesses
three
very
precious
things
the
first
is
a
hammer
which
both
the
frost
and
the
mountain
giants
know
to
their
cost
when
they
see
it
hurled
against
them
in
the
air
for
it
has
split
many
a
skull
of
their
fathers
and
kindred
when
thrown
it
returns
to
his
hand
of
its
own
accord
the
second
rare
thing
he
possesses
is
called
the
belt
of
strength
when
he
girds
it
about
him
his
divine
might
is
doubled
the
third
also
very
precious
is
his
iron
gloves
which
he
puts
on
whenever
he
would
use
his
mallet
efficiently
from
thor
name

derived
our
word
thursday
frey
is
one
of
the
most
celebrated
of
the
gods
he
presides
over
rain
and
sunshine
and
all
the
fruits
of
the
earth
his
sister
freya
is
the
most
propitious
of
the
goddesses
she
loves
music
spring
and
flowers
and
is
particularly
fond
of
the
elves
fairies
she
is
very
fond
of
love
ditties
and
all
lovers
would
do
well
to
invoke
her
bragi
is
the
god
of
poetry
and
his
song
records
the
deeds
of
warriors
his
wife
iduna
keeps
in
a
box
the
apples
which
the
gods
when
they
feel
old
age
approaching
have
only
to
taste
of
to
become
young
again
heimdall
is
the
watchman
of
the
gods
and
is
therefore
placed
on
the
borders
of
heaven
to
prevent
the
giants
from
forcing
their
way
over
the
bridge
bifrost
the
rainbow
he
requires
less
sleep
than
a
bird
and
sees
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
a
hundred
miles
around
him
so
acute
is
his
ear
that
no
sound
escapes
him
for
he
can
even
hear
the
grass
grow
and
the
wool
on
a
sheep
back
of
loki
and
his
progeny
there
is
another
deity
who
is
described
as
the
calumniator
of
the
gods
and
the
contriver
of
all
fraud
and
mischief
his
name
is
loki
he
is
handsome
and
well
made
but
of
a
very
fickle
mood
and
most
evil
disposition
he
is
of
the
giant
race
but
forced
himself
into
the
company
of
the
gods
and
seems
to
take
pleasure
in
bringing
them
into
difficulties
and
in
extricating
them
out
of
the
danger
by
his
cunning
wit
and
skill
loki
has
three
children
the
first
is
the
wolf
fenris
the
second
the
midgard
serpent
the
third
hela
death
the
gods
were
not
ignorant
that
these
monsters
were
growing
up
and
that
they
would
one
day
bring
much
evil
upon
gods
and
men
so
odin
deemed
it
advisable
to
send
one
to
bring
them
to
him
when
they
came
he
threw
the
serpent
into
that
deep
ocean
by
which
the
earth
is
surrounded
but
the
monster
had
grown
to
such
an
enormous
size
that
holding
his
tail
in
his
mouth
he
encircles
the
whole
earth
hela
he
cast
into
niffleheim
and
gave
her
power
over
nine
worlds
or
regions
into
which
she
distributes
those
who
are
sent
to
her
that
is
all
who
die
of
sickness
or
old
age
her
hall
is
called
elvidner
hunger
is
her
table
starvation
her
knife
delay
her
man
slowness
her
maid
precipice
her
threshold
care
her
bed
and
burning
anguish
forms
the
hangings
of
the
apartments
she
may
easily
be
recognized
for
her
body
is
half
flesh
color
and
half
blue
and
she
has
a
dreadfully
stern
and
forbidding
countenance
the
wolf
fenris
gave
the
gods
a
great
deal
of
trouble
before
they
succeeded
in
chaining
him
he
broke
the
strongest
fetters
as
if
they
were
made
of
cobwebs
finally
the
gods
sent
a
messenger
to
the
mountain
spirits
who
made
for
them
the
chain
called
gleipnir
it
is
fashioned
of
six
things
the
noise
made
by
the
footfall
of
a
cat
the
beards
of
women
the
roots
of
stones
the
breath
of
fishes
the
nerves
sensibilities
of
bears
and
the
spittle
of
birds
when
finished
it
was
as
smooth
and
soft
as
a
silken
string
but
when
the
gods
asked
the
wolf
to
suffer
himself
to
be
bound
with
this
apparently
slight
ribbon
he
suspected
their
design
fearing
that
it
was
made
by
enchantment
he
therefore
only
consented
to
be
bound
with
it
upon
condition
that
one
of
the
gods
put
his
hand
in
his
fenris
mouth
as
a
pledge
that
the
band
was
to
be
removed
again
tyr
the
god
of
battles
alone
had
courage
enough
to
do
this
but
when
the
wolf
found
that
he
could
not
break
his
fetters
and
that
the
gods
would
not
release
him
he
bit
off
tyr
hand
and
he
has
ever
since
remained
how
thor
paid
the
mountain
giant
his
wages
once
on
a
time
when
the
gods
were
constructing
their
abodes
and
had
already
finished
midgard
and
valhalla
a
certain
artificer
came
and
offered
to
build
them
a
residence
so
well
fortified
that
they
should
be
perfectly
safe
from
the
incursions
of
the
frost
giants
and
the
giants
of
the
mountains
but
he
demanded
for
his
reward
the
goddess
freya
together
with
the
sun
and
moon
the
gods
yielded
to
his
terms
provided
he
would
finish
the
whole
work
himself
without
any
one
assistance
and
all
within
the
space
of
one
winter
but
if
anything
remained
unfinished
on
the
first
day
of
summer
he
should
forfeit
the
recompense
agreed
on
on
being
told
these
terms
the
artificer
stipulated
that
he
should
be
allowed
the
use
of
his
horse
svadilfari
and
this
by
the
advice
of
loki
was
granted
to
him
he
accordingly
set
to
work
on
the
first
day
of
winter
and
during
the
night
let
his
horse
draw
stone
for
the
building
the
enormous
size
of
the
stones
struck
the
gods
with
astonishment
and
they
saw
clearly
that
the
horse
did
more
of
the
toilsome
work
than
his
master
their
bargain
however
had
been
concluded
and
confirmed
by
solemn
oaths
for
without
these
precautions
a
giant
would
not
have
thought
himself
safe
among
the
gods
especially
when
thor
should
return
from
an
expedition
he
had
then
undertaken
against
the
evil
demons
as
the
winter
drew
to
a
close
the
building
was
far
advanced
and
the
bulwarks
were
sufficiently
high
and
massive
to
render
the
place
impregnable
in
short
when
it
wanted
but
three
days
to
summer
the
only
part
that
remained
to
be
finished
was
the
gateway
then
sat
the
gods
on
their
seats
of
justice
and
entered
into
consultation
inquiring
of
one
another
who
among
them
could
have
advised
to
give
freya
away
or
to
plunge
the
heavens
in
darkness
by
permitting
the
giant
to
carry
away
the
sun
and
the
moon
they
all
agreed
that
no
one
but
loki
the
author
of
so
many
evil
deeds
could
have
given
such
bad
counsel
and
that
he
should
be
put
to
a
cruel
death
if
he
did
not
contrive
some
way
to
prevent
the
artificer
from
completing
his
task
and
obtaining
the
stipulated
recompense
they
proceeded
to
lay
hands
on
loki
who
in
his
fright
promised
upon
oath
that
let
it
cost
him
what
it
would
he
would
so
manage
matters
that
the
man
should
lose
his
reward
that
very
night
when
the
man
went
with
svadilfari
for
building
stone
a
mare
suddenly
ran
out
of
a
forest
and
began
to
neigh
the
horse
thereat
broke
loose
and
ran
after
the
mare
into
the
forest
which
obliged
the
man
also
to
run
after
his
horse
and
thus
between
one
and
another
the
whole
night
was
lost
so
that
at
dawn
the
work
had
not
made
the
usual
progress
the
man
seeing
that
he
must
fail
of
completing
his
task
resumed
his
own
gigantic
stature
and
the
gods
now
clearly
perceived
that
it
was
in
reality
a
mountain
giant
who
had
come
amongst
them
feeling
no
longer
bound
by
their
oaths
they
called
on
thor
who
immediately
ran
to
their
assistance
and
lifting
up
his
mallet
paid
the
workman
his
wages
not
with
the
sun
and
moon
and
not
even
by
sending
him
back
to
jotunheim
for
with
the
first
blow
he
shattered
the
skull
to
pieces
and
hurled
him
headlong
into
niffleheim
the
recovery
of
the
hammer
once
upon
a
time
it
happened
that
thor
hammer
fell
into
the
possession
of
the
giant
thrym
who
buried
it
eight
fathoms
deep
under
the
rocks
of
jotunheim
thor
sent
loki
to
negotiate
with
thrym
but
he
could
only
prevail
so
far
as
to
get
the
promise
to
restore
the
weapon
if
freya
would
consent
to
be
his
bride
loki
returned
and
reported
the
result
of
his
mission
but
the
goddess
of
love
was
quite
horrified
at
the
idea
of
bestowing
her
charms
on
the
king
of
the
frost
giants
in
this
emergency
loki
persuaded
thor
to
dress
himself
in
freya
clothes
and
accompany
him
to
jotunheim
thrym
received
his
veiled
bride
with
due
courtesy
but
was
greatly
surprised
at
seeing
her
eat
for
her
supper
eight
salmons
and
a
full
grown
ox
besides
other
delicacies
washing
the
whole
down
with
three
tuns
of
mead
loki
however
assured
him
that
she
had
not
tasted
anything
for
eight
long
nights
so
great
was
her
desire
to
see
her
lover
the
renowned
ruler
of
jotunheim
thrym
had
at
length
the
curiosity
to
peep
under
his
bride
veil
but
started
back
in
affright
and
demanded
why
freya
eyeballs
glistened
with
fire
loki
repeated
the
same
excuse
and
the
giant
was
satisfied
he
ordered
the
hammer
to
be
brought
in
and
laid
on
the
maiden
lap
thereupon
thor
threw
off
his
disguise
grasped
his
redoubted
weapon
and
slaughtered
thrym
and
all
his
followers
frey
also
possessed
a
wonderful
weapon
a
sword
which
would
of
itself
spread
a
field
with
carnage
whenever
the
owner
desired
it
frey
parted
with
this
sword
but
was
less
fortunate
than
thor
and
never
recovered
it
it
happened
in
this
way
frey
once
mounted
odin
throne
from
whence
one
can
see
over
the
whole
universe
and
looking
round
saw
far
off
in
the
giant
kingdom
a
beautiful
maid
at
the
sight
of
whom
he
was
struck
with
sudden
sadness
insomuch
that
from
that
moment
he
could
neither
sleep
nor
drink
nor
speak
at
last
skirnir
his
messenger
drew
his
secret
from
him
and
undertook
to
get
him
the
maiden
for
his
bride
if
he
would
give
him
his
sword
as
a
reward
frey
consented
and
gave
him
the
sword
and
skirnir
set
off
on
his
journey
and
obtained
the

that
within

thor
visit
to
jotunheim
the
giant
country
one
day
the
god
thor
with
his
servant
thialfi
and
accompanied
by
loki
set
out
on
a
journey
to
the
giant
country
thialfi
was
of
all
men
the
swiftest
of
foot
he
bore
thor
wallet
containing
their
provisions
when
night
came
on
they
found
themselves
in
an
immense
forest
and
searched
on
all
sides
for
a
place
where
they
might
pass
the
night
and
at
last
came
to
a
very
large
hall
with
an
entrance
that
took
the
whole
breadth
of
one
end
of
the
building
here
they
lay
down
to
sleep
but
towards
midnight
were
alarmed
by
an
earthquake
which
shook
the
whole
edifice
thor
rising
up
called
on
his
companions
to
seek
with
him
a
place
of
safety
on
the
right
they
found
an
adjoining
chamber
into
which
the
others
entered
but
thor
remained
at
the
doorway
with
his
mallet
in
his
hand
prepared
to
defend
himself
whatever
might
happen
a
terrible
groaning
was
heard
during
the
night
and
at
dawn
of
day
thor
went
out
and
found
lying
near
him
a
huge
giant
who
slept
and
snored
in
the
way
that
had
alarmed
them
so
it
is
said
that
for
once
thor
was
afraid
to
use
his
mallet
and
as
the
giant
soon
waked
up
thor
contented
himself
with
simply
asking
his
name
my
name
is
skrymir
said
the
giant
but
i
need
not
ask
thy
name
for
i
know
that
thou
art
the
god
thor
but
what
has
become
of
my
glove
thor
then
perceived
that
what
they
had
taken
overnight
for
a
hall
was
the
giant
glove
and
the
chamber
where
his
two
companions
had
sought
refuge
was
the
thumb
skrymir
then
proposed
that
they
should
travel
in
company
and
thor
consenting
they
sat
down
to
eat
their
breakfast
and
when
they
had
done
skrymir
packed
all
the
provisions
into
one
wallet
threw
it
over
his
shoulder
and
strode
on
before
them
taking
such
tremendous
strides
that
they
were
hard
put
to
it
to
keep
up
with
him
so
they
travelled
the
whole
day
and
at
dusk
skrymir
chose
a
place
for
them
to
pass
the
night
in
under
a
large
oak
tree
skrymir
then
told
them
he
would
lie
down
to
sleep
but
take
ye
the
wallet
he
added
and
prepare
your
supper
skrymir
soon
fell
asleep
and
began
to
snore
strongly
but
when
thor
tried
to
open
the
wallet
he
found
the
giant
had
tied
it
up
so
tight
he
could
not
untie
a
single
knot
at
last
thor
became
wroth
and
grasping
his
mallet
with
both
hands
he
struck
a
furious
blow
on
the
giant
head
skrymir
awakening
merely
asked
whether
a
leaf
had
not
fallen
on
his
head
and
whether
they
had
supped
and
were
ready
to
go
to
sleep
thor
answered
that
they
were
just
going
to
sleep
and
so
saying
went
and
laid
himself
down
under
another
tree
but
sleep
came
not
that
night
to
thor
and
when
skrymir
snored
again
so
loud
that
the
forest
reechoed
with
the
noise
he
arose
and
grasping
his
mallet
launched
it
with
such
force
at
the
giant
skull
that
it
made
a
deep
dint
in
it
skrymir
awakening
cried
out
what
the
matter
are
there
any
birds
perched
on
this
tree
i
felt
some
moss
from
the
branches
fall
on
my
head
how
fares
it
with
thee
thor
but
thor
went
away
hastily
saying
that
he
had
just
then
awoke
and
that
as
it
was
only
midnight
there
was
still
time
for
sleep
he
however
resolved
that
if
he
had
an
opportunity
of
striking
a
third
blow
it
should
settle
all
matters
between
them
a
little
before
daybreak
he
perceived
that
skrymir
was
again
fast
asleep
and
again
grasping
his
mallet
he
dashed
it
with
such
violence
that
it
forced
its
way
into
the
giant
skull
up
to
the
handle
but
skrymir
sat
up
and
stroking
his
cheek
said
an
acorn
fell
on
my
head
what
art
thou
awake
thor
me
thinks
it
is
time
for
us
to
get
up
and
dress
ourselves
but
you
have
not
now
a
long
way
before
you
to
the
city
called
utgard
i
have
heard
you
whispering
to
one
another
that
i
am
not
a
man
of
small
dimensions
but
if
you
come
to
utgard
you
will
see
there
many
men
much
taller
than
wherefore
i
advise
you
when
you
come
there
not
to
make
too
much
of
yourselves
for
the
followers
of
utgard
loki
will
not
brook
the
boasting
of
such
little
fellows
as
you
are
you
must
take
the
road
that
leads
eastward
mine
lies
northward
so
we
must
part
here
hereupon
he
threw
his
wallet
over
his
shoulders
and
turned
away
from
them
into
the
forest
and
thor
had
no
wish
to
stop
him
or
to
ask
for
any
more
of
his
company
thor
and
his
companions
proceeded
on
their
way
and
towards
noon
descried
a
city
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
plain
it
was
so
lofty
that
they
were
obliged
to
bend
their
necks
quite
back
on
their
shoulders
in
order
to
see
to
the
top
of
it
on
arriving
they
entered
the
city
and
seeing
a
large
palace
before
them
with
the
door
wide
open
they
went
in
and
found
a
number
of
men
of
prodigious
stature
sitting
on
benches
in
the
hall
going
further
they
came
before
the
king
whom
they
saluted
with
great
respect
the
king
regarding
them
with
a
scornful
smile
said
if
i
do
not
mistake
me
that
stripling
yonder
must
be
the
god
thor
then
addressing
himself
to
thor
he
said
perhaps
thou
mayst
be
more
than
thou
appearest
to
be
what
are
the
feats
that
thou
and
thy
fellows
deem
yourselves
skilled
in
for
no
one
is
permitted
to
remain
here
who
does
not
in
some
feat
or
other
excel
all
other
men
the
feat
that
i
know
said
loki
is
to
eat
quicker
than
any
one
else
and
in
this
i
am
ready
to
give
a
proof
against
any
one
here
who
may
choose
to
compete
with
me
that
will
indeed
be
a
feat
said
if
thou
performest
what
thou
promisest
and
it
shall
be
tried
forthwith
he
then
ordered
one
of
his
men
who
was
sitting
at
the
farther
end
of
the
bench
and
whose
name
was
logi
to
come
forward
and
try
his
skill
with
loki
a
trough
filled
with
meat
having
been
set
on
the
hall
floor
loki
placed
himself
at
one
end
and
logi
at
the
other
and
each
of
them
began
to
eat
as
fast
as
he
could
until
they
met
in
the
middle
of
the
trough
but
it
was
found
that
loki
had
only
eaten
the
flesh
while
his
adversary
had
devoured
both
flesh
and
bone
and
the
trough
to
boot
all
the
company
therefore
adjudged
that
loki
was
vanquished
then
asked
what
feat
the
young
man
who
accompanied
thor
could
perform
thialfi
answered
that
he
would
run
a
race
with
any
one
who
might
be
matched
against
him
the
king
observed
that
skill
in
running
was
something
to
boast
of
but
if
the
youth
would
win
the
match
he
must
display
great
agility
he
then
arose
and
went
with
all
who
were
present
to
a
plain
where
there
was
good
ground
for
running
on
and
calling
a
young
man
named
hugi
bade
him
run
a
match
with
thialfi
in
the
first
course
hugi
so
much
his
competitor
that
he
turned
back
and
met
him
not
far
from
the
starting
place
then
they
ran
a
second
and
a
third
time
but
thialfi
met
with
no
better
success
then
asked
thor
in
what
feats
he
would
choose
to
give
proofs
of
that
prowess
for
which
he
was
so
famous
thor
answered
that
he
would
try
a
with
any
one
bade
his
bring
the
large
horn
which
his
followers
were
obliged
to
empty
when
they
had
trespassed
in
any
way
against
the
law
of
the
feast
the
cupbearer
having
presented
it
to
thor
said
whoever
is
a
good
drinker
will
empty
that
horn
at
a
single
draught
though
most
men
make
two
of
it
but
the
most
puny
drinker
can
do
it
in
three
thor
looked
at
the
horn
which
seemed
of
no
extraordinary
size
though
somewhat
long
however
as
he
was
very
thirsty
he
set
it
to
his
lips
and
without
drawing
breath
pulled
as
long
and
as
deeply
as
he
could
that
he
might
not
be
obliged
to
make
a
second
draught
of
it
but
when
he
set
the
horn
down
and
looked
in
he
could
scarcely
perceive
that
the
liquor
was
diminished
after
taking
breath
thor
went
to
it
again
with
all
his
might
but
when
he
took
the
horn
from
his
mouth
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
drunk
rather
less
than
before
although
the
horn
could
now
be
carried
without
spilling
how
now
thor
said
thou
must
not
spare
thyself
if
thou
meanest
to
drain
the
horn
at
the
third
draught
thou
must
pull
deeply
and
i
must
needs
say
that
thou
wilt
not
be
called
so
mighty
a
man
here
as
thou
art
at
home
if
thou
showest
no
greater
prowess
in
other
feats
than
methinks
will
be
shown
in
this
thor
full
of
wrath
again
set
the
horn
to
his
lips
and
did
his
best
to
empty
it
but
on
looking
in
found
the
liquor
was
only
a
little
lower
so
he
resolved
to
make
no
further
attempt
but
gave
back
the
horn
to
the
i
now
see
plainly
said
that
thou
art
not
quite
so
stout
as
we
thought
thee
but
wilt
thou
try
any
other
feat
though
methinks
thou
art
not
likely
to
bear
any
prize
away
with
thee
hence
what
new
trial
hast
thou
to
propose
said
thor
we
have
a
very
trifling
game
here
answered
in
which
we
exercise
none
but
children
it
consists
in
merely
lifting
my
cat
from
the
ground
nor
should
i
have
dared
to
mention
such
a
feat
to
the
great
thor
if
i
had
not
already
observed
that
thou
art
by
no
means
what
we
took
thee
for
as
he
finished
speaking
a
large
gray
cat
sprang
on
the
hall
floor
thor
put
his
hand
under
the
cat
belly
and
did
his
utmost
to
raise
him
from
the
floor
but
the
cat
bending
his
back
had
notwithstanding
all
thor
efforts
only
one
of
his
feet
lifted
up
seeing
which
thor
made
no
further
attempt
this
trial
has
turned
out
said
just
as
i
imagined
it
would
the
cat
is
large
but
thor
is
little
in
comparison
to
our
men
little
as
ye
call
me
answered
thor
let
me
see
who
among
you
will
come
hither
now
i
am
in
wrath
and
wrestle
with
me
i
see
no
one
here
said
looking
at
the
men
sitting
on
the
benches
who
would
not
think
it
beneath
him
to
wrestle
with
thee
let
somebody
however
call
hither
that
old
crone
my
nurse
elli
and
let
thor
wrestle
with
her
if
he
will
she
has
thrown
to
the
ground
many
a
man
not
less
strong
than
this
thor
is
a
toothless
old
woman
then
entered
the
hall
and
was
told
by
to
take
hold
of
thor
the
tale
is
shortly
told
the
more
thor
tightened
his
hold
on
the
crone
the
firmer
she
stood
at
length
after
a
very
violent
struggle
thor
began
to
lose
his
footing
and
was
finally
brought
down
upon
one
knee
then
told
them
to
desist
adding
that
thor
had
now
no
occasion
to
ask
any
one
else
in
the
hall
to
wrestle
with
him
and
it
was
also
getting
late
so
he
showed
thor
and
his
companions
to
their
seats
and
they
passed
the
night
there
in
good
cheer
the
next
morning
at
break
of
day
thor
and
his
companions
dressed
themselves
and
prepared
for
their
departure
ordered
a
table
to
be
set
for
them
on
which
there
was
no
lack
of
victuals
or
drink
after
the
repast
led
them
to
the
gate
of
the
city
and
on
parting
asked
thor
how
he
thought
his
journey
had
turned
out
and
whether
he
had
met
with
any
men
stronger
than
himself
thor
told
him
that
he
could
not
deny
but
that
he
had
brought
great
shame
on
himself
and
what
grieves
me
most
he
added
is
that
ye
will
call
me
a
person
of
little
worth
nay
said
it
behooves
me
to
tell
thee
the
truth
now
thou
art
out
of
the
city
which
so
long
as
i
live
and
have
my
way
thou
shalt
never
enter
again
and
by
my
troth
had
i
known
beforehand
that
thou
hadst
so
much
strength
in
thee
and
wouldst
have
brought
me
so
near
to
a
great
mishap
i
would
not
have
suffered
thee
to
enter
this
time
know
then
that
i
have
all
along
deceived
thee
by
my
illusions
first
in
the
forest
where
i
tied
up
the
wallet
with
iron
wire
so
that
thou
couldst
not
untie
it
after
this
thou
gavest
me
three
blows
with
thy
mallet
the
first
though
the
least
would
have
ended
my
days
had
it
fallen
on
me
but
i
slipped
aside
and
thy
blows
fell
on
the
mountain
where
thou
wilt
find
three
glens
one
of
them
remarkably
deep
these
are
the
dints
made
by
thy
mallet
i
have
made
use
of
similar
illusions
in
the
contests
you
have
had
with
my
followers
in
the
first
loki
like
hunger
itself
devoured
all
that
was
set
before
him
but
logi
was
in
reality
nothing
else
than
fire
and
therefore
consumed
not
only
the
meat
bat
the
trough
which
held
it
hugi
with
whom
thialfi
contended
in
running
was
thought
and
it
was
impossible
for
thialfi
to
keep
pace
with
that
when
thou
in
thy
turn
didst
attempt
to
empty
the
horn
thou
didst
perform
by
my
troth
a
deed
so
marvellous
that
had
i
not
seen
it
myself
i
should
never
have
believed
it
for
one
end
of
that
horn
reached
the
sea
which
thou
wast
not
aware
of
but
when
thou
comest
to
the
shore
thou
wilt
perceive
how
much
the
sea
has
sunk
by
thy
draughts
thou
didst
perform
a
feat
no
less
wonderful
by
lifting
up
the
cat
and
to
tell
thee
the
truth
when
we
saw
that
one
of
his
paws
was
off
the
floor
we
were
all
of
us
for
what
thou
tookest
for
a
cat
was
in
reality
the
midgard
serpent
that
encompasseth
the
earth
and
he
was
so
stretched
by
thee
that
he
was
barely
long
enough
to
enclose
it
between
his
head
and
tail
thy
wrestling
with
elli
was
also
a
most
astonishing
feat
for
there
was
never
yet
a
man
nor
ever
will
be
whom
old
age
for
such
in
fact
was
elli
will
not
sooner
or
later
lay
low
but
now
as
we
are
going
to
part
let
me
tell
thee
that
it
will
be
better
for
both
of
us
if
thou
never
come
near
me
again
for
shouldst
thou
do
so
i
shall
again
defend
myself
by
other
illusions
so
that
thou
wilt
only
lose
thy
labor
and
get
no
fame
from
the
contest
with
me
on
hearing
these
words
thor
in
a
rage
laid
hold
of
his
mallet
and
would
have
launched
it
at
him
but
had
disappeared
and
when
thor
would
have
returned
to
the
city
to
destroy
it
he
found
nothing
around
him
but
a
verdant
plain
chapter
xl
the
death
of
baldur
the
elves
runic

iceland
teutonic
mythology
nibelungen
lied
the
death
of
baldur
baldur
the
good
having
been
tormented
with
terrible
dreams
indicating
that
his
life
was
in
peril
told
them
to
the
assembled
gods
who
resolved
to
conjure
all
things
to
avert
from
him
the
threatened
danger
then
frigga
the
wife
of
odin
exacted
an
oath
from
fire
and
water
from
iron
and
all
other
metals
from
stones
trees
diseases
beasts
birds
poisons
and
creeping
things
that
none
of
them
would
do
any
harm
to
baldur
odin
not
satisfied
with
all
this
and
feeling
alarmed
for
the
fate
of
his
son
determined
to
consult
the
prophetess
angerbode
a
giantess
mother
of
fenris
hela
and
the
midgard
serpent
she
was
dead
and
odin
was
forced
to
seek
her
in
hela
dominions
this
descent
of
odin
forms
the
subject
of
gray
fine
ode
beginning
uprose
the
king
of
men
with
speed
and
saddled
straight
his
steed
but
the
other
gods
feeling
that
what
frigga
had
done
was
quite
sufficient
amused
themselves
with
using
baldur
as
a
mark
some
hurling
darts
at
him
some
stones
while
others
hewed
at
him
with
their
swords
and
for
do
what
they
would
none
of
them
could
harm
him
and
this
became
a
favorite
pastime
with
them
and
was
regarded
as
an
honor
shown
to
baldur
but
when
loki
beheld
the
scene
he
was
sorely
vexed
that
baldur
was
not
hurt
assuming
therefore
the
shape
of
a
woman
he
went
to
fensalir
the
sion
of
frigga
that
goddess
when
she
saw
the
pretended
woman
inquired
of
her
if
she
knew
what
the
gods
were
doing
at
their
meetings
she
replied
that
they
were
throwing
darts
and
stones
at
baldur
without
being
able
to
hurt
him
ay
said
frigga
neither
stones
nor
sticks
nor
anything
else
can
hurt
baldur
for
i
have
exacted
an
oath
from
all
of
them
what
exclaimed
the
woman
have
all
things
sworn
to
spare
baldur
all
things
replied
frigga
except
one
little
shrub
that
grows
on
the
eastern
side
of
valhalla
and
is
called
mistletoe
and
which
i
thought
too
young
and
feeble
to
crave
an
oath
from
as
soon
as
loki
heard
this
he
went
away
and
resuming
his
natural
shape
cut
off
the
mistletoe
and
repaired
to
the
place
where
the
gods
were
assembled
there
he
found
hodur
standing
apart
without
partaking
of
the
sports
on
account
of
his
blindness
and
going
up
to
him
said
why
dost
thou
not
also
throw
something
at
baldur
because
i
am
blind
answered
hodur
and
see
not
where
baldur
is
and
have
moreover
nothing
to
throw
come
then
said
loki
do
like
the
rest
and
show
honor
to
baldur
by
throwing
this
twig
at
him
and
i
will
direct
thy
arm
towards
the
place
where
he
stands
hodur
then
took
the
mistletoe
and
under
the
guidance
of
loki
darted
it
at
baldur
who
pierced
through
and
through
fell
down
lifeless
surely
never
was
there
witnessed
either
among
gods
or
men
a
more
atrocious
deed
than
this
when
baldur
fell
the
gods
were
struck
speechless
with
horror
and
then
they
looked
at
each
other
and
all
were
of
one
mind
to
lay
hands
on
him
who
had
done
the
deed
but
they
were
obliged
to
delay
their
vengeance
out
of
respect
for
the
sacred
place
where
they
were
assembled
they
gave
vent
to
their
grief
by
loud
lamentations
when
the
gods
came
to
themselves
frigga
asked
who
among
them
wished
to
gain
all
her
love
and
good
will
for
this
said
she
shall
he
have
who
will
ride
to
hel
and
offer
hela
a
ransom
if
she
will
let
baldur
return
to
asgard
whereupon
hermod
surnamed
the
nimble
the
son
of
odin
offered
to
undertake
the
journey
odin
horse
sleipnir
which
has
eight
legs
and
can
outrun
the
wind
was
then
led
forth
on
which
hermod
mounted
and
galloped
away
on
his
mission
for
the
space
of
nine
days
and
as
many
nights
he
rode
through
deep
glens
so
dark
that
he
could
not
discern
anything
until
he
arrived
at
the
river
gyoll
which
he
passed
over
on
a
bridge
covered
with
glittering
gold
the
maiden
who
kept
the
bridge
asked
him
his
name
and
lineage
telling
him
that
the
day
before
five
bands
of
dead
persons
had
ridden
over
the
bridge
and
did
not
shake
it
as
much
as
he
alone
but
she
added
thou
hast
not
death
hue
on
thee
why
then
ridest
thou
here
on
the
way
to
hel
i
ride
to
hel
answered
hermod
to
seek
baldur
hast
thou
perchance
seen
him
pass
this
way
she
replied
baldur
hath
ridden
over
gyoll
bridge
and
yonder
lieth
the
way
he
took
to
the
abodes
of
death
hermod
pursued
his
journey
until
he
came
to
the
barred
gates
of
hel
here
he
alighted
girthed
his
saddle
tighter
and
remounting
clapped
both
spurs
to
his
horse
who
cleared
the
gate
by
a
tremendous
leap
without
touching
it
hermod
then
rode
on
to
the
palace
where
he
found
his
brother
baldur
occupying
the
most
distinguished
seat
in
the
hall
and
passed
the
night
in
his
company
the
next
morning
he
besought
hela
to
let
baldur
ride
home
with
him
assuring
her
that
nothing
but
lamentations
were
to
be
heard
among
the
gods
hela
answered
that
it
should
now
be
tried
whether
baldur
was
so
beloved
as
he
was
said
to
be
if
therefore
she
added
all
things
in
the
world
both
living
and
lifeless
weep
for
him
then
shall
he
return
to
life
but
if
any
one
thing
speak
against
him
or
refuse
to
weep
he
shall
be
kept
in
hel
hermod
then
rode
back
to
asgard
and
gave
an
account
of
all
he
had
heard
and
witnessed
the
gods
upon
this
despatched
messengers
throughout
the
world
to
beg
everything
to
weep
in
order
that
baldur
might
be
delivered
from
hel
all
things
very
willingly
complied
with
this
request
both
men
and
every
other
living
being
as
well
as
earths
and
stones
and
trees
and
metals
just
as
we
have
all
seen
these
things
weep
when
they
are
brought
from
a
cold
place
into
a
hot
one
as
the
messengers
were
returning
they
found
an
old
hag
named
thaukt
sitting
in
a
cavern
and
begged
her
to
weep
baldur
out
of
hel
but
she
answered
thaukt
will
wail
with
dry
tears
baldur
let
hela
keep
her
own
it
was
strongly
suspected
that
this
hag
was
no
other
than
loki
himself
who
never
ceased
to
work
evil
among
gods
and
men
so
baldur
was
prevented
from
coming
back
to
asgard
footnote
in
longfellow
poems
will
be
found
a
poem
entitled
tegner
drapa
upon
the
subject
of
baldur
death
the
gods
took
up
the
dead
body
and
bore
it
to
the
seashore
where
stood
baldur
ship
hringham
which
passed
for
the
largest
in
the
world
baldur
dead
body
was
put
on
the
funeral
pile
on
board
the
ship
and
his
wife
nanna
was
so
struck
with
grief
at
the
sight
that
she
broke
her
heart
and
her
body
was
burned
on
the
same
pile
as
her
husband
there
was
a
vast
concourse
of
various
kinds
of
people
at
baldur
obsequies
first
came
odin
accompanied
by
frigga
the
valkyrie
and
his
ravens
then
frey
in
his
car
drawn
by
gullinbursti
the
boar
heimdall
rode
his
horse
gulltopp
and
freya
drove
in
her
chariot
drawn
by
cats
there
were
also
a
great
many
frost
giants
and
giants
of
the
mountain
present
baldur
horse
was
led
to
the
pile
fully
caparisoned
and
consumed
in
the
same
flames
with
his
master
but
loki
did
not
escape
his
deserved
punishment
when
he
saw
how
angry
the
gods
were
he
fled
to
the
mountain
and
there
built
himself
a
hut
with
four
doors
so
that
he
could
see
every
approaching
danger
he
invented
a
net
to
catch
the
fishes
such
as
fishermen
have
used
since
his
time
but
odin
found
out
his
place
and
the
gods
assembled
to
take
him
he
seeing
this
changed
himself
into
a
salmon
and
lay
hid
among
the
stones
of
the
brook
but
the
gods
took
his
net
and
dragged
the
brook
and
loki
finding
he
must
be
caught
tried
to
leap
over
the
net
but
thor
caught
him
by
the
tail
and
compressed
it
so
that
salmons
ever
since
have
had
that
part
remarkably
fine
and
thin
they
bound
him
with
chains
and
suspended
a
serpent
over
his
head
whose
venom
falls
upon
his
face
drop
by
drop
his
wife
siguna
sits
by
his
side
and
catches
the
drops
as
they
fall
in
a
cup
but
when
she
carries
it
away
to
empty
it
the
venom
falls
upon
loki
which
makes
him
howl
with
horror
and
twist
his
body
about
so
violently
that
the
whole
earth
shakes
and
this
produces
what
men
call
earthquakes
the
elves
the
edda
mentions
another
class
of
beings
inferior
to
the
gods
but
still
possessed
of
great
power
these
were
called
elves
the
white
spirits
or
elves
of
light
were
exceedingly
fair
more
brilliant
than
the
sun
and
clad
in
garments
of
a
delicate
and
transparent
texture
they
loved
the
light
were
kindly
disposed
to
mankind
and
generally
appeared
as
fair
and
lovely
children
their
country
was
called
alfheim
and
was
the
domain
of
freyr
the
god
of
the
sun
in
whose
light
they
were
always
sporting
the
black
or
night
elves
were
a
different
kind
of
creatures
ugly
dwarfs
of
a
dirty
brown
color
they
appeared
only
at
night
for
they
avoided
the
sun
as
their
most
deadly
enemy
because
whenever
his
beams
fell
upon
any
of
them
they
changed
them
immediately
into
stones
their
language
was
the
echo
of
solitudes
and
their
subterranean
caves
and
clefts
they
were
supposed
to
have
come
into
existence
as
maggots
produced
by
the
decaying
flesh
of
ymir
body
and
were
afterwards
endowed
by
the
gods
with
a
human
form
and
great
understanding
they
were
particularly
distinguished
for
a
knowledge
of
the
mysterious
powers
of
nature
and
for
the
runes
which
they
carved
and
explained
they
were
the
most
skilful
artificers
of
all
created
beings
and
worked
in
metals
and
in
wood
among
their
most
noted
works
were
thor
hammer
and
the
ship
skidbladnir
which
they
gave
to
freyr
and
which
was
so
large
that
it
could
contain
all
the
deities
with
their
war
and
household
implements
but
so
skillfully
was
it
wrought
that
when
folded
together
it
could
be
put
into
a
side
pocket
ragnarok
the
twilight
of
the
gods
it
was
a
firm
belief
of
the
northern
nations
that
a
time
would
come
when
all
the
visible
creation
the
gods
of
valhalla
and
niffleheim
the
inhabitants
of
jotunheim
alfheim
and
midgard
together
with
their
habitations
would
be
destroyed
the
fearful
day
of
destruction
will
not
however
be
without
its
forerunners
first
will
come
a
triple
winter
during
which
snow
will
fall
from
the
four
corners
of
the
heavens
the
frost
be
very
severe
the
wind
piercing
the
weather
tempestuous
and
the
sun
impart
no
gladness
three
such
winters
will
pass
away
without
being
tempered
by
a
single
summer
three
other
similar
winters
will
then
follow
during
which
war
and
discord
will
spread
over
the
universe
the
earth
itself
will
be
frightened
and
begin
to
tremble
the
sea
leave
its
basin
the
heavens
tear
asunder
and
men
perish
in
great
numbers
and
the
eagles
of
the
air
feast
upon
their
still
quivering
bodies
the
wolf
fenris
will
now
break
his
bands
the
midgard
serpent
rise
out
of
her
bed
in
the
sea
and
loki
released
from
his
bonds
will
join
the
enemies
of
the
gods
amidst
the
general
devastation
the
sons
of
muspelheim
will
rush
forth
under
their
leader
surtur
before
and
behind
whom
are
flames
and
burning
fire
onward
they
ride
over
bifrost
the
rainbow
bridge
which
breaks
under
the
horses
hoofs
but
they
disregarding
its
fall
direct
their
course
to
the
battlefield
called
vigrid
thither

with
all

up

sinks
into

the

fall

cause
a

a

arise
out

the

filled
with
abundant
supplies
will
spontaneously
produce
its
fruits
without

wickedness

will
no

will
live
happily
together
runic
letters
one
can
not
travel
far
in
denmark
norway
or
sweden
without
meeting
with
great
stones
of
different
forms
engraven
with
characters
called
runic
which
appear
at
first
sight
very
different
from
all
we
know
the
letters
consist
almost
invariably
of
straight
lines
in
the
shape
of
little
sticks
either
singly
or
put
together
such
sticks
were
in
early
times
used
by
the
northern
nations
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
future
events
the
sticks
were
shaken
up
and
from
the
figures
that
they
formed
a
kind
of
divination
was
derived
the
runic
characters
were
of
various
kinds
they
were
chiefly
used
for
magical
purposes
the
noxious
or
as
they
called
them
the
bitter
runes
were
employed
to
bring
various
evils
on
their
enemies
the
favorable
averted
misfortune
some
were
medicinal
others
employed
to
win
love
etc
in
later
times
they
were
frequently
used
for
inscriptions
of
which
more
than
a
thousand
have
been
found
the
language
is
a
dialect
of
the
gothic
called
norse
still
in
use
in
iceland
the
inscriptions
may
therefore
be
read
with
certainty
but
hitherto
very
few
have
been
found
which
throw
the

in

iceland

the

like
the

where
of

we

looked

the

of

was

a

of

country
where

by

it

teutonic

in
the
mythology
of

proper
the

of

appears
as
wotan
freya

are
regarded
as

are
in

represented
as

however
teutonic
mythology
runs
along
almost
identical
lines
with
that
of

the

is

the

one
of

myths
of

in
the
great
national
epic
of

dates
back
to
the
prehistoric
era
when
wotan
frigga
thor
loki
and

gods
and

were
worshipped
in

forests
the
epic
is
divided
into
two
parts
the
first
of
which
tells
how
siegfried
the
youngest
of
the
kings
of
the

went
to
worms
to
ask
in
marriage
the
hand
of
kriemhild
sister
of
gunther
king
of
burgundy
while
he
was
staying
with
gunther
siegfried
helped
the
burgundian
king
to
secure
as
his
wife
brunhild
queen
of
issland
the
latter
had
announced
publicly
that
he
only
should
be
her
husband
who
could
beat
her
in
hurling
a
spear
throwing
a
huge
stone
and
in
leaping
siegfried
who
possessed
a
cloak
of
invisibility
aided
gunther
in
these
three
contests
and
brunhild
became
his
wife
in
return
for
these
services
gunther
gave
siegfried
his
sister
kriemhild
in
marriage
after
some
time
had
elapsed
siegfried
and
kriemhild
went
to

gunther
when
the
two
women
fell
into
a
dispute
about
the
relative
merits
of
their
husbands
kriemhild
to
exalt
siegfried
boasted
that
it
was
to
the
latter
that
gunther
owed
his
victories
and
his
wife
brunhild
in
great
anger
employed

liegeman
of

to
murder

in

is
described
as

this

obtained
from

upon

seized

buried
it

at

the

was

when

though
richard
wagner
of
the
nibelungen
ring
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
ancient
german
epic
it
is
a
wholly
independent
composition
and
was
derived
from
various
old
songs
and
sagas
which
the
dramatist
wove
into
one
great
harmonious
story
the
principal
source
was
the

while
lesser

were
taken
from

from

the

in

there
are
at

the

they
hate
what

are
enemies
of

they

the

hating

they

a

funeral
march
is
heard
and
brunhild
rides
into

flames
and
sacrifices
herself
for

sake
the
ring
goes
back
to
the
and
the
old
world
of
the
gods
of
valhalla
of
passion
and
sin
is
burnt
up
with
flames
for
the
gods
have
broken
moral
law
and
coveted
power
rather
than
love
gold
rather
than
truth
and
therefore
must
perish
they
pass
and
a
new
era
the
reign
of
love
and
truth
has
begun
those
who

to
study
the
differences
in
the

for
a

thorough
and
clear
analysis
of

it
with

probably
nothing

antiquaries
tell
us
means
the
life
of
everything
or
the
source
of
all
beings
and
which
seems
to
have
affinity
with
the
phoenician
baal
what
renders
this
affinity
more
striking
is
that
the
druids
as
well
as
the
phoenicians
identified
this
their
supreme
deity
with
the
sun
fire
was
regarded
as
a
symbol
of
the
divinity
the
latin
writers
assert
that
the
druids
also
worshipped
numerous
inferior
gods
they
used
no
images
to
represent
the
object
of
their
worship
nor
did
they
meet
in
temples
or
buildings
of
any
kind
for
the
performance
of
their
sacred
rites
a
circle
of
stones
each
stone
generally
of
vast
size
enclosing
an
area
of
from
twenty
feet
to
thirty
yards
in
diameter
constituted
their
sacred
place
the
most
celebrated
of
these
now
remaining
is
stonehenge
on
salisbury
plain
england
these
sacred
circles
were
generally
situated
near
some
stream
or
under
the
shadow
of
a
grove
or
oak
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
stood
the
cromlech
or
altar
which
was
a
large
stone
placed
in
the
manner
of
a
table
upon
other
stones
set
up
on
end
the
druids
had
also
their
high
places
which
were
large
stones
or
piles
of
stones
on
the
summits
of
hills
these
were
called
cairns
and
were
used
in
the
worship
of
the
deity
under
the
symbol
of
the
sun
that
the
druids
offered
sacrifices
to
their
deity
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
there
is
some
uncertainty
as
to
what
they
offered
and
of
the
ceremonies
connected
with
their
religious
services
we
know
almost
nothing
the
classical
roman
writers
affirm
that
they
offered
on
great
occasions
human
sacrifices
as
for
success
in
war
or
for
relief
from
dangerous
diseases
caesar
has
given
a
detailed
account
of
the
manner
in
which
this
was
done
they
have
images
of
immense
size
the
limbs
of
which
are
framed
with
twisted
twigs
and
filled
with
living
persons
these
being
set
on
fire
those
within
are
encompassed
by
the
flames
many
attempts
have
been
made
by
celtic
writers
to
shake
the
testimony
of
the
roman
historians
to
this
fact
but
without
success
the
druids
observed
two
festivals
in
each
year
the
former
took
place
in
the
beginning
of
may
and
was
called
beltane
or
fire
of
god
on
this
occasion
a
large
fire
was
kindled
on
some
elevated
spot
in
honor
of
the
sun
whose
returning
beneficence
they
thus
welcomed
after
the
gloom
and
desolation
of
winter
of
this
custom
a
trace
remains
in
the
name
given
to
whitsunday
in
parts
of
scotland
to
this
day
sir
walter
scott
uses
the
word
in
the
boat
song
in
the
lady
of
the
lake
ours
is
no
sapling
chance
sown
by
the
fountain
blooming
at
beltane
in
winter
to
fade
etc
the
other
great
festival
of
the
druids
was
called
or
fire
of
peace
and
was
held
on
halloweve
first
of
november
which
still
retains
this
designation
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
on
this
occasion
the
druids
assembled
in
solemn
conclave
in
the
most
central
part
of
the
district
to
discharge
the
judicial
functions
of
their
order
all
questions
whether
public
or
private
all
crimes
against
person
or
property
were
at
this
time
brought
before
them
for
adjudication
with
these
judicial
acts
were
combined
certain
superstitious
usages
especially
the
kindling
of
the
sacred
fire
from
which
all
the
fires
in
the
district
which
had
been
beforehand
scrupulously
extinguished
might
be
relighted
this
usage
of
kindling
fires
on
lingered
in
the
british
islands
long
after
the
establishment
of
christianity
besides
these
two
great
annual
festivals
the
druids
were
in
the
habit
of
observing
the
full
moon
and
especially
the
sixth
day
of
the
moon
on
the
latter
they
sought
the
mistletoe
which
grew
on
their
favorite
oaks
and
to
which
as
well
as
to
the
oak
itself
they
ascribed
a
peculiar
virtue
and
sacredness
the
discovery
of
it
was
an
occasion
of
rejoicing
and
solemn
worship
they
call
it
says
pliny
by
a
word
in
their
language
which
means
all
and
having
made
solemn
preparation
for
feasting
and
sacrifice
under
the
tree
they
drive
thither
two
bulls
whose
horns
are
then
for
the
first
time
bound
the
priest
then
robed
in
white
ascends
the
tree
and
cuts
off
the
mistletoe
with
a
golden
sickle
it
is
caught
in
a
white
mantle
after
which
they
proceed
to
slay
the
victims
at
the
same
time
praying
that
god
would
render
his
gift
prosperous
to
those
to
whom
he
had
given
it
they
drink
the
water
in
which
it
has
been
infused
and
think
it
a
remedy
for
all
diseases
the
mistletoe
is
a
parasitic
plant
and
is
not
always
nor
often
found
on
the
oak
so
that
when
it
is
found
it
is
the
more
precious
the
druids
were
the
teachers
of
morality
as
well
as
of
religion
of
their
ethical
teaching
a
valuable
specimen
is
preserved
in
the
triads
of
the
welsh
bards
and
from
this
we
may
gather
that
their
views
of
moral
rectitude
were
on
the
whole
just
and
that
they
held
and
inculcated
many
very
noble
and
valuable
principles
of
conduct
they
were
also
the
men
of
science
and
learning
of
their
age
and
people
whether
they
were
acquainted
with
letters
or
not
has
been
disputed
though
the
probability
is
strong
that
they
were
to
some
extent
but
it
is
certain
that
they
committed
nothing
of
their
doctrine
their
history
or
their
poetry
to
writing
their
teaching
was
oral
and
their
literature
if
such
a
word
may
be
used
in
such
a
case
was
preserved
solely
by
tradition
but
the
roman
writers
admit
that
they
paid
much
attention
to
the
order
and
laws
of
nature
and
investigated
and
taught
to
the
youth
under
their
charge
many
things
concerning
the
stars
and
their
motions
the
size
of
the
world
and
the
lands
and
concerning
the
might
and
power
of
the
immortal
gods
their
history
consisted
in
traditional
tales
in
which
the
heroic
deeds
of
their
forefathers
were
celebrated
these
were
apparently
in
verse
and
thus
constituted
part
of
the
poetry
as
well
as
the
history
of
the
druids
in
the
poems
of
ossian
we
have
if
not
the
actual
productions
of
druidical
times
what
may
be
considered
faithful
representations
of
the
songs
of
the
bards
the
bards
were
an
essential
part
of
the
druidical
hierarchy
one
author
pennant
says
the
bards
were
supposed
to
be
endowed
with
powers
equal
to
inspiration
they
were
the
oral
historians
of
all
past
transactions
public
and
private
they
were
also
accomplished
genealogists
etc
pennant
gives
a
minute
account
of
the
eisteddfods
or
sessions
of
the
bards
and
minstrels
which
were
held
in
wales
for
many
centuries
long
after
the
druidical
priesthood
in
its
other
departments
became
extinct
at
these
meetings
none
but
bards
of
merit
were
suffered
to
rehearse
their
pieces
and
minstrels
of
skill
to
perform
judges
were
appointed
to
decide
on
their
respective
abilities
and
suitable
degrees
were
conferred
in
the
earlier
period
the
judges
were
appointed
by
the
welsh
princes
and
after
the
conquest
of
wales
by
commission
from
the
kings
of
england
yet
the
tradition
is
that
edward
in
revenge
for
the
influence
of
the
bards
in
animating
the
resistance
of
the
people
to
his
sway
persecuted
them
with
great
cruelty
this
tradition
has
furnished
the
poet
gray
with
the
subject
of
his
celebrated
ode
the
bard
there
are
still
occasional
meetings
of
the
lovers
of
welsh
poetry
and
music
held
under
the
ancient
name
among
hemans
poems
is
one
written
for
an
eisteddfod
or
meeting
of
welsh
bards
held
in
london
may
it
begins
with
a
description
of
the
ancient
meeting
of
which
the
following
lines
are
a
part
midst
the
eternal
cliffs
whose
strength
defied
the
crested
roman
in
his
hour
of
pride
and
where
the
druid
ancient
cromlech
frowned
and
the
oaks
breathed
mysterious
murmurs
round
there
thronged
the
inspired
of
yore
on
plain
or
height
in
the
sun
face
beneath
the
eye
of
light
and
baring
unto
heaven
each
noble
head
stood
in
the
circle
where
none
else
might
tread
the
druidical
system
was
at
its
height
at
the
time
of
the
roman
invasion
under
julius
caesar
against
the
druids
as
their
chief
enemies
these
conquerors
of
the
world
directed
their
unsparing
fury
the
druids
harassed
at
all
points
on
the
mainland
retreated
to
anglesey
and
iona
where
for
a
season
they
found
shelter
and
continued
their
now
dishonored
rites
the
druids
retained
their
predominance
in
iona
and
over
the
adjacent
islands
and
mainland
until
they
were
supplanted
and
their
superstitions
overturned
by
the
arrival
of
columba
the
apostle
of
the
highlands
by
whom
the
inhabitants
of
that
district
were
first
led
to
profess
christianity
iona
one
of
the
smallest
of
the
british
isles
situated
near
a
rugged
and
barren
coast
surrounded
by
dangerous
seas
and
possessing
no
sources
of
internal
wealth
iona
has
obtained
an
imperishable
place
in
history
as
the
seat
of
civilization
and
religion
at
a
time
when
the
darkness
of
heathenism
hung
over
almost
the
whole
of
northern
europe
lona
or
icolmkill
is
situated
at
the
extremity
of
the
island
of
mull
from
which
it
is
separated
by
a
strait
of
half
a
mile
in
breadth
its
distance
from

of
scotland
being
miles
columba
was
a
native
of
ireland
and
connected
by
birth
with
the
princes
of
the
land
ireland
was
at
that
time
a
land
of
gospel
light
while
the
western
and
northern
parts
of
scotland
were
still
immersed
in
the
darkness
of
heathenism
columba
with
twelve
friends
landed
on
the
island
of
lona
in
the
year
of
our
lord
having
made
the
passage
in
a
wicker
boat
covered
with
hides
the
druids
who
occupied
the
island
endeavored
to
prevent
his
settling
there
and
the
savage
nations
on
the
adjoining
shores
incommoded
him
with
their
hostility
and
on
several
occasions
endangered
his
life
by
their
attacks
yet
by
his
perseverance
and
zeal
he
surmounted
all
opposition
procured
from
the
king
a
gift
of
the
island
and
established
there
a
monastery
of
which
he
was
the
abbot
he
was
unwearied
in
his
labors
to
disseminate
a
knowledge
of
the
scriptures
throughout
the
highlands
and
islands
of
scotland
and
such
was
the
reverence
paid
him
that
though
not
a
bishop
but
merely
a
presbyter
and
monk
the
entire
province
with
its
bishops
was
subject
to
him
and
his
successors
the
pictish
monarch
was
so
impressed
with
a
sense
of
his
wisdom
and
worth
that
he
held
him
in
the
highest
honor
and
the
neighboring
chiefs
and
princes
sought
his
counsel
and
availed
themselves
of
his
judgment
in
settling
their
disputes
when
columba
landed
on
lona
he
was
attended
by
twelve
followers
whom
he
had
formed
into
a
religious
body
of
which
he
was
the
head
to
these
as
occasion
required
others
were
from
time
to
time
added
so
that
the
original
number
was
always
kept
up
their
institution
was
called
a
monastery
and
the
superior
an
abbot
but
the
system
had
little
in
common
with
the
monastic
institutions
of
later
times
the
name
by
which
those
who
submitted
to
the
rule
were
known
was
that
of
culdees
probably
from
the
latin
cultores
dei
worshippers
of
god
they
were
a
body
of
religious
persons
associated
together
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
each
other
in
the
common
work
of
preaching
the
gospel
and
teaching
youth
as
well
as
maintaining
in
themselves
the
fervor
of
devotion
by
united
exercises
of
worship
on
entering
the
order
certain
vows
were
taken
by
the
members
but
they
were
not
those
which
were
usually
imposed
by
monastic
orders
for
of
these
which
are
three
celibacy
poverty
and
the
culdees
were
bound
to
none
except
the
third
to
poverty
they
did
not
bind
themselves
on
the
contrary
they
seem
to
have
labored
diligently
to
procure
for
themselves
and
those
dependent
on
them
the
comforts
of
life
marriage
also
was
allowed
them
and
most
of
them
seem
to
have
entered
into
that
state
true
their
wives
were
not
permitted
to
reside
with
them
at
the
institution
but
they
had
a
residence
assigned
to
them
in
an
adjacent
locality
near
lona
there
is
an
island
which
still
bears
the
name
of

where
their
husbands
seem
to
have
resided
with
them
except
when
duty
required
their
presence
in
the
school
or
the
sanctuary
campbell
in
his
poem
of
reullura
alludes
to
the
married
monks
of

the
pure

were
albyn
earliest
priests

an

in
these
respects
and
in
others
the
culdees
departed
from
the
established
rules
of
the
romish
church
and
consequently
were
deemed
heretical
the
consequence
was
that
as
the
power
of
the
latter
advanced
that
of
the
culdees
was
enfeebled
it
was
not
however
till
the
thirteenth
centurv
that
the
communities
of
the
culdees
were
suppressed
and
the
members
dispersed
they
still
continued
to
labor
as
individuals
and
resisted
the
inroads
of
papal
usurpation
as
they
best
might
till
the
light
of
the
reformation
dawned
on
the
world
iona
from
its
position
in
the
western
seas
was
exposed
to
the
assaults
of
the
norwegian
and
danish
rovers
by
whom
those
seas
were
infested
and
by
them
it
was
repeatedly
pillaged
its
dwellings
burned
and
its
peaceful
inhabitants
put
to
the
sword
these
unfavorable
circumstances
led
to
its
gradual
decline
which
was
expedited
by
the
subversion
of
the
culdees
throughout
scotland
under
the
reign
of
popery
the
island
became
the
seat
of
a
nunnery
the
ruins
of
which
are
still
seen
at
the
reformation
the
nuns
were
allowed
to
remain
living
in
community
when
the
abbey
was
dismantled
iona
is
now
chiefly
resorted
to
by
travellers
on
account
of
the
numerous
ecclesiastical
and
sepulchral
remains
which
are
found
upon
it
the
principal
of
these
are
the
cathedral
or
abbey
church
and
the
chapel
of
the
nunnery
besides
these
remains
of
ecclesiastical
antiquity
there
are
some
of
an
earlier
date
and
pointing
to
the
existence
on
the
island
of
forms
of
worship
and
belief
different
from
those
of
christianity
these
are
the
circular
cairns
which
are
found
in
various
parts
and
which
seem
to
have
been
of
druidical
origin
it
is
in
reference
to
all
these
remains
of
ancient
religion
that
johnson
exclaims
that
man
is
little
to
be
envied
whose
patriotism

not

each
could
enforce
his
dominion
and
occasionally
those
chiefs
would
unite
for
a
common
object
but
in
ordinary
times
they
were
much
more
likely
to
be
found
in
hostility
to
one
another
in
such
a
state
of
things
the
rights
of
the
humbler
classes
of
society
were
at
the
mercy
of
every
assailant
and
it
is
plain
that
without
some
check
upon
the
lawless
power
of
the
chiefs
society
must
have
relapsed
into
barbarism
such
checks
were
found
first
in
the
rivalry
of
the
chiefs
themselves
whose
mutual
jealousy
made
them
restraints
upon
one
another
secondly
in
the
influence
of
the
church
which
by
every
motive
pure
or
selfish
was
pledged
to
interpose
for
the
protection
of
the
weak
and
lastly
in
the
generosity
and
sense
of
right
which
however
crushed
under
the
weight
of
passion
and
selfishness
dwell
naturally
in
the
heart
of
man
from
this
last
source
sprang
chivalry
which
framed
an
ideal
of
the
heroic
character
combining
invincible
strength
and
valor
justice
modesty
loyalty
to
superiors
courtesy
to
equals
compassion
to
weakness
and
devotedness
to
the
church
an
ideal
which
if
never
met
with
in
real
life
was
acknowledged
by
all
as
the
highest
model
for
emulation
the
word
chivalry
is
derived
from
the
french
cheval
a
horse
the
word
knight
which
originally
meant
boy
or
servant
was
particularly
applied
to
a
young
man
after
he
was
admitted
to
the
privilege
of
bearing
arms
this
privilege
was
conferred
on
youths
of
family
and
fortune
only
for
the
mass
of
the
people
were
not
furnished
with
arms
the
knight
then
was
a
mounted
warrior
a
man
of
rank
or
in
the
service
and
maintenance
of
some
man
of
rank
generally
possessing
some
independent
means
of
support
but
often
relying
mainly
on
the
gratitude
of
those
whom
he
served
for
the
supply
of
his
wants
and
often
no
doubt
resorting
to
the
means
which
power
confers
on
its
possessor
in
time
of
war
the
knight
was
with
his
followers
in
the
camp
of
his
sovereign
or
commanding
in
the
field
or
holding
some
castle
for
him
in
time
of
peace
he
was
often
in
attendance
at
his
sovereign
court
gracing
with
his
presence
the
banquets
and
tournaments
with
which
princes
cheered
their
leisure
or
he
was
traversing
the
country
in
quest
of
adventure
professedly
bent
on
redressing
wrongs
and
enforcing
rights
sometimes
in
fulfilment
of
some
vow
of
religion
or
of
love
these
wandering
knights
were
called
they
were
welcome
guests
in
the
castles
of
the
nobility
for
their
presence
enlivened
the
dulness
of
those
secluded
abodes
and
they
were
received
with
honor
at
the
abbeys
which
often
owed
the
best
part
of
their
revenues
to
the
patronage
of
the
knights
but
if
no
castle
or
abbey
or
hermitage
were
at
hand
their
hardy
habits
made
it
not
intolerable
to
them
to
lie
down
supperless
at
the
foot
of
some
wayside
cross
and
pass
the
night
it
is
evident
that
the
justice
administered
by
such
an
instrumentality
must
have
been
of
the
rudest
description
the
force
whose
legitimate
purpose
was
to
redress
wrongs
might
easily
be
perverted
to
inflict
them
accordingly
we
find
in
the
romances
which
however
fabulous
in
facts
are
true
as
pictures
of
manners
that
a
knightly
castle
was
often
a
terror
to
the
surrounding
country
that
is
dungeons
were
full
of
oppressed
knights
and
ladies
waiting
for
some
champion
to
appear
to
set
them
free
or
to
be
ransomed
with
money
that
hosts
of
idle
retainers
were
ever
at
hand
to
enforce
their
lord
behests
regardless
of
law
and
justice
and
that
the
rights
of
the
unarmed
multitude
were
of
no
account
this
contrariety
of
fact
and
theory
in
regard
to
chivalry
will
account
for
the
opposite
impressions
which
exist
in
minds
respecting
it
while
it
has
been
the
theme
of
the
most
fervid
eulogium
on
the
one
part
it
has
been
as
eagerly
denounced
on
the
other
on
a
cool
estimate
we
can
not
but
see
reason
to
congratulate
ourselves
that
it
has
given
way
in
modern
times
to
the
reign
of
law
and
that
the
civil
magistrate
if
less
picturesque
has
taken
the
place
of
the
mailed
champion
the
training
of
a
knight
the
preparatory
education
of
candidates
for
knighthood
was
long
and
arduous
at
seven
years
of
age
the
noble
children
were
usually
removed
from
their
father
house
to
the
court
or
castle
of
their
future
patron
and
placed
under
the
care
of
a
governor
who
taught
them
the
first
articles
of
religion
and
respect
and
reverence
for
their
lords
and
superiors
and
initiated
them
in
the
ceremonies
of
a
court
they
were
called
pages
valets
or
varlets
and
their
office
was
to
carve
to
wait
at
table
and
to
perform
other
menial
services
which
were
not
then
considered
humiliating
in
their
leisure
hours
they
learned
to
dance
and
play
on
the
harp
were
instructed
in
the
mysteries
of
woods
and
rivers
that
is
in
hunting
falconry
and
fishing
and
in
wrestling
tilting
with
spears
and
performing
other
military
exercises
on
horseback
at
fourteen
the
page
became
an
esquire
and
began
a
course
of
severer
and
more
laborious
exercises
to
vault
on
a
horse
in
heavy
armor
to
run
to
scale
walls
and
spring
over
ditches
under
the
same
encumbrance
to
wrestle
to
wield
the
for
a
length
of
time
without
raising
the
visor
or
taking
breath
to
perform
with
grace
all
the
evolutions
of
horsemanship
were
necessary
preliminaries
to
the
reception
of
knighthood
which
was
usually
conferred
at
years
of
age
when
the
young
education
was
supposed
to
be
completed
in
the
meantime
the
esquires
were
no
less
assiduously
engaged
in
acquiring
all
those
refinements
of
civility
which
formed
what
was
in
that
age
called
courtesy
the
same
castle
in
which
they
received
their
education
was
usually
thronged
with
young
persons
of
the
other
sex
and
the
page
was
encouraged
at
a
very
early
age
to
select
some
lady
of
the
court
as
the
mistress
of
his
heart
to
whom
he
was
taught
to
refer
all
his
sentiments
words
and
actions
the
service
of
his
mistress
was
the
glory
and
occupation
of
a
knight
and
her
smiles
bestowed
at
once
by
affection
and
gratitude
were
held
out
as
the
recompense
of
his
valor
religion
united
its
influence
with
those
of
loyalty
and
love
and
the
order
of
knighthood
endowed
with
all
the
sanctity
and
religious
awe
that
attended
the
priesthood
became
an
object
of
ambition
to
the
greatest
sovereigns
the
ceremonies
of
initiation
were
peculiarly
solemn
after
undergoing
a
severe
fast
and
spending
whole
nights
in
prayer
the
candidate
confessed
and
received
the
sacrament
he
then
clothed
himself
in
garments
and
repaired
to
the
church
or
the
hall
where
the
ceremony
was
to
take
place
bearing
a
knightly
sword
suspended
from
his
neck
which
the
officiating
priest
took
and
blessed
and
then
returned
to
him
the
candidate
then
with
folded
arms
knelt
before
the
presiding
knight
who
after
some
questions
about
his
motives
and
purposes
in
requesting
admission
administered
to
him
the
oaths
and
granted
his
request
some
of
the
knights
present
sometimes
even
ladies
and
damsels
handed
to
him
in
succession
the
spurs
the
coat
of
mail
the
hauberk
the
armlet
and
gauntlet
and
lastly
he
girded
on
the
sword
he
then
knelt
again
before
the
president
who
rising
from
his
seat
gave
him
the
accolade
which
consisted
of
three
strokes
with
the
flat
of
a
sword
on
the
shoulder
or
neck
of
the
candidate
accompanied
by
the
words
in
the
name
of
god
of
michael
and
george
i
make
thee
a
knight
be
valiant
courteous
and
loyal
then
he
received
his
helmet
his
shield
and
spear
and
thus
the
investiture
ended
freemen
villains
serfs
and
clerks
the
other
classes
of
which
society
was
composed
were
first
freemen
owners
of
small
portions
of
land
independent
though
they
sometimes
voluntarily
became
the
vassals
of
their
more
opulent
neighbors
whose
power
was
necessary
for
their
protection
the
other
two
classes
which
were
much
the
most
numerous
were
either
serfs
or
villains
both
of
which
were
slaves
the
serfs
were
in
the
lowest
state
of
slavery
all
the
fruits
of
their
labor
belonged
to
the
master
whose
land
they
tilled
and
by
whom
they
were
fed
and
clothed
the
villians
were
less
degraded
their
situation
seems
to
have
resembled
that
of
the
russian
peasants
at
this
day
like
the
serfs
they
were
attached
to
the
soil
and
were
transferred
with
it
by
purchase
but
they
paid
only
a
fixed
rent
to
the
landlord
and
had
a
right
to
dispose
of
any
surplus
that
might
arise
from
their
industry
the
term
clerk
was
of
very
extensive
import
it
comprehended
originally
such
persons
only
as
belonged
to
the
clergy
or
clerical
order
among
whom
however
might
be
found
a
multitude
of
married
persons
artisans
or
others
but
in
process
of
time
a
much
wider
rule
was
established
every
one
that
could
read
being
accounted
a
clerk
or
clericus
and
allowed
the
benefit
of
clergy
that
is
exemption
from
capital
and
some
other
forms
of
punishment
in
case
of
crime
tournaments
the
splendid
pageant
of
a
tournament
between
knights
its
gaudy
accessories
and
trappings
and
its
chivalrous
regulations
originated
in
france
tournaments
were
repeatedly
condemned
by
the
church
probably
on
account
of
the
quarrels
they
led
to
and
the
often
fatal
results
the
joust
or
just
was
different
from
the
tournament
in
these
knights
fought
with
their
lances
and
their
object
was
to
unhorse
their
antagonists
while
the
tournaments
were
intended
for
a
display
of
skill
and
address
in
evolutions
and
with
various
weapons
and
greater
courtesy
was
observed
in
the
regulations
by
these
it
was
forbidden
to
wound
the
horse
or
to
use
the
point
of
the
sword
or
to
strike
a
knight
after
he
had
raised
his
vizor
or
unlaced
his
helmet
the
ladies
encouraged
their
knights
in
these
exercises
they
bestowed
prizes
and
the
conqueror
feats
were
the
theme
of
romance
and
song
the
stands
overlooking
the
ground
of
course
were
varied
in
the
shapes
of
towers
terraces
galleries
and
pensile
gardens
magnificently
decorated
with
tapestry
pavilions
and
banners
every
combatant
proclaimed
the
name
of
the
lady
whose
servant
he
was
he
was
wont
to
look
up
to
the
stand
and
strengthen
his
courage
by
the
sight
of
the
bright
eyes
that
were
raining
their
influence
on
him
from
above
the
knights
also
carried
favors
consisting
of
scarfs
veils
sleeves
bracelets
clasps
in
short
some
piece
of
female
habiliment
attached
to
their
helmets
shields
or
armor
if
during
the
combat
any
of
these
appendages
were
dropped
or
lost
the
fair
donor
would
at
times
send
her
knight
new
ones
especially
if
pleased
with
his
exertions
mail
armor
mail
armor
of
which
the
hauberk
is
a
species
and
which
derived
its
name
from
maille
a
french
word
for
mesh
was
of
two
kinds
plate
or
scale
mail
and
chain
mail
it
was
originally
used
for
the
protection
of
the
body
only
reaching
no
lower
than
the
knees
it
was
shaped
like
a
carter
frock
and
bound
round
the
waist
by
a
girdle
gloves
and
hose
of
mail
were
afterwards
added
and
a
hood
which
when
necessary
was
drawn
over
the
head
leaving
the
face
alone
uncovered
to
protect
the
skin
from
the
impression
of
the
iron
network
of
the
chain
mail
a
quilted
lining
was
employed
which
however
was
insufficient
and
the
bath
was
used
to
efface
the
marks
of
the
armor
the
hauberk
was
a
complete
covering
of
double
chain
mail
some
hauberks
opened
before
like
a
modern
coat
others
were
closed
like
a
shirt
the
chain
mail
of
which
they
were
composed
was
formed
by
a
number
of
iron
links
each
link
having
others
inserted
into
it
the
whole
exhibiting
a
kind
of
network
of
which
in
some
instances
at
least
the
meshes
were
circular
with
each
link
separately
riveted
the
hauberk
was
proof
against
the
most
violent
blow
of
a
sword
but
the
point
of
a
lance
might
pass
through
the
meshes
or
drive
the
iron
into
the
flesh
to
guard
against
this
a
thick
and
stuffed
doublet
was
worn
underneath
under
which
was
commonly
added
an
iron
breastplate
hence
the
expression
to
pierce
both
plate
and
mail
so
common
in
the
earlier
poets
mail
armor
continued
in
general
use
till
about
the
year
when
it
was
gradually
supplanted
by
plate
armor
or
suits
consisting
of
pieces
or
plates
of
solid
iron
adapted
to
the
different
parts
of
the
body
shields
were
generally
made
of
wood
covered
with
leather
or
some
similar
substance
to
secure
them
in
some
sort
from
being
cut
through
by
the
sword
they
were
surrounded
with
a
hoop
of
metal
helmets
the
helmet
was
composed
of
two
parts
the
headpiece
which
was
strengthened
within
by
several
circles
of
iron
and
the
visor
which
as
the
name
implies
was
a
sort
of
grating
to
see
through
so
contrived
as
by
sliding
in
a
groove
or
turning
on
a
pivot
to
be
raised
or
lowered
at
pleasure
some
helmets
had
a
further
improvement
called
a
bever
from
the
italian
bevere
to
drink
the
ventayle
or
is
another
name
for
this
to
secure
the
helmet
from
the
possibility
of
falling
or
of
being
struck
off
it
was
tied
by
several
laces
to
the
meshes
of
the
hauberk
consequently
when
a
knight
was
overthrown
it
was
necessary
to
undo
these
laces
before
he
could
be
put
to
death
though
this
was
sometimes
effected
by
lifting
up
the
skirt
of
the
hauberk
and
stabbing
him
in
the
belly
the
instrument
of
death
was
a
small
dagger
worn
on
the
right
side
romances
in
ages
when
there
were
no
books
when
noblemen
and
princes
themselves
could
not
read
history
or
tradition
was
monopolized
by
the
they
inherited
generation
after
generation
the
wondrous
tales
of
their
predecessors
which
they
retailed
to
the
public
with
such
additions
of
their
own
as
their
acquired
information
supplied
them
with
anachronisms
became
of
course
very
common
and
errors
of
geography
of
locality
of
manners
equally
so
spurious
genealogies
were
invented
in
which
arthur
and
his
knights
and
charlemagne
and
his
paladins
were
made
to
derive
their
descent
from
aeneas
hector
or
some
other
of
the
trojan
heroes
with
regard
to
the
derivation
of
the
word
romance
we
trace
it
to
the
fact
that
the
dialects
which
were
formed
in
western
europe
from
the
admixture
of
latin
with
the
native
languages
took
the
name
of
langue
romaine
the
french
language
was
divided
into
two
dialects
the
river
loire
was
their
common
boundary
in
the
provinces
to
the
south
of
that
river
the
affirmative
yes
was
expressed
by
the
word
oc
in
the
north
it
was
called
oil
oui
and
hence
dante
has
named
the
southern
language
langue
and
the
northern
langue
the
latter
which
was
carried
into
england
by
the
normans
and
is
the
origin
of
the
present
french
may
be
called
the
french
romane
and
the
former
the
provencal
or
provencial
romane
because
it
was
spoken
by
the
people
of
provence
and
languedoc
southern
provinces
of
france
these
dialects
were
soon
distinguished
by
very
opposite
characters
a
soft
and
enervating
climate
a
spirit
of
commerce
encouraged
by
an
easy
communication
with
other
maritime
nations
the
influx
of
wealth
and
a
more
settled
government
may
have
tended
to
polish
and
soften
the
diction
of
the
provencials
whose
poets
under
the
name
of
troubadours
were
the
masters
of
the
italians
and
particularly
of
petrarch
their
favorite
pieces
were
sirventes
satirical
pieces
and
tensons
which
last
were
a
sort
of
dialogue
in
verse
between
two
poets
who
questioned
each
other
on
some
refined
points
of
loves
casuistry
it
seems
the
provencials
were
so
completely
absorbed
in
these
delicate
questions
as
to
neglect
and
despise
the
composition
of
fabulous
histories
of
adventure
and
knighthood
which
they
left
in
a
great
measure
to
the
poets
of
the
northern
part
of
the
kingdom
called
trouveurs
at
a
time
when
chivalry
excited
universal
admiration
and
when
all
the
efforts
of
that
chivalry
were
directed
against
the
enemies
of
religion
it
was
natural
that
literature
should
receive
the
same
impulse
and
that
history
and
fable
should
be
ransacked
to
furnish
examples
of
courage
and
piety
that
might
excite
increased
emulation
arthur
and
charlemagne
were
the
two
heroes
selected
for
this
purpose
arthur
pretensions
were
that
he
was
a
brave
though
not
always
a
successful
warrior
he
had
withstood
with
great
resolution
the
arms
of
the
infidels
that
is
to
say
of
the
saxons
and
his
memory
was
held
in
the
highest
estimation
by
his
countrymen
the
britons
who
carried
with
them
into
wales
and
into
the
kindred
country
of
armorica
or
brittany
the
memory
of
his
exploits
which
their
national
vanity
insensibly
exaggerated
till
the
little
prince
of
the
silures
south
wales
was
magnified
into
the
conqueror
of
england
of
gaul
and
of
the
greater
part
of
europe
his
genealogy
was
gradually
carried
up
to
an
imaginary
brutus
and
to
the
period
of
the
trojan
war
and
a
sort
of
chronicle
was
composed
in
the
welsh
or
armorican
language
which
under
the
pompous
title
of
the
history
of
the
kings
of
britain
was
translated
into
latin
by
geoffrey
of
monmouth
about
the
year
the
welsh
critics
consider
the
material
of
the
work
to
have
been
an
older
history
written
by
talian
bishop
of
asaph
in
the
seventh
century
as
to
charlemagne
though
his
real
merits
were
sufficient
to
secure
his
immortality
it
was
impossible
that
his
holy
wars
against
the
saracens
should
not
become
a
favorite
topic
for
fiction
accordingly
the
fabulous
history
of
these
wars
was
written
probably
towards
the
close
of
the
eleventh
century
by
a
monk
who
thinking
it
would
add
dignity
to
his
work
to
embellish
it
with
a
contemporary
name
boldly
ascribed
it
to
turpin
who
was
archbishop
of
rheims
about
the
year
these
fabulous
chronicles
were
for
a
while
imprisoned
in
languages
of
local
only
or
of
professional
access
both
turpin
and
geoffrey
might
indeed
be
read
by
ecclesiastics
the
sole
latin
scholars
of
those
times
and
geoffrey
british
original
would
contribute
to
the
gratification
of
welshmen
but
neither
could
become
extensively
popular
till
translated
into
some
language
of
general
and
familiar
use
the
was
at
that
time
used
only
by
a
conquered
and
enslaved
nation
the
spanish
and
italian
languages
were
not
yet
formed
the
norman
french
alone
was
spoken
and
understood
by
the
nobility
in
the
greater
part
of
europe
and
therefore
was
a
proper
vehicle
for
the
new
mode
of
composition
that
language
was
fashionable
in
england
before
the
conquest
and
became
after
that
event
the
only
language
used
at
the
court
of
london
as
the
various
conquests
of
the
normans
and
the
enthusiastic
valor
of
that
extraordinary
people
had
familiarized
the
minds
of
men
with
the
most
marvellous
events
their
poets
eagerly
seized
the
fabulous
legends
of
arthur
and
charlemagne
translated
them
into
the
language
of
the
day
and
soon
produced
a
variety
of
imitations
the
adventures
attributed
to
these
monarchs
and
to
their
distinguished
warriors
together
with
those
of
many
other
traditionary
or
imaginary
heroes
composed
by
degrees
that
formidable
body
of
marvellous
histories
which
from
the
dialect
in
which
the
most
ancient
of
them
were
written
were
called
romances
metrical
romances
the
earliest
form
in
which
romances
appear
is
that
of
a
rude
kind
of
verse
in
this
form
it
is
supposed
they
were
sung
or
recited
at
the
feasts
of
princes
and
knights
in
their
baronial
halls

this

of

was

among
the

of

in

ages
immediately

that

at

the

previous

it
was
not
till
toward
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
that
the
prose
romances
began
to
appear
these
works
generally
began
with
disowning
and
discrediting
the
sources
from
which
in
reality
they
drew
their
sole
information
as
every
romance
was
supposed
to
be
a
real
history
the
compilers
of
those
in
prose
would
have
forfeited
all
credit
if
they
had
announced
themselves
as
mere
copyists
of
the
minstrels
on
the
contrary
they
usually
state
that
as
the
popular
poems
upon

contain

they
had
been
induced
to
translate

of
such
or
such
a
knight
from
the
original
latin
or
greek
or
from
the
ancient
british
or

authorities

authorities
existed

a

of
the
style
of

chapter
ii
the
mythical
history
of
england
the
illustrious
poet
milton
in
his
history
of
england
is
the
author
whom
we
chiefly
follow
in
this
chapter
according
to
the
earliest
accounts
albion
a
giant
and
son
of
neptune
a
contemporary
of
hercules
ruled
over
the
island
to
which
he
gave
his
name
presuming
to
oppose
the
progress
of
hercules
in
his
western
march
he
was
slain
by
him
another
story
is
that
histion
the
son
of
japhet
the
son
of
noah
had
four
sons
francus
romanus
alemannus
and
britto
from
whom
descended
the
french
roman
german
and
british
people
rejecting
these
and
other
like
stories
milton
gives
more
regard
to
the
story
of
brutus
the
trojan
which
he
says
is
supported
by
descents
of
ancestry
long
continued
laws
and
exploits
not
plainly
seeming
to
be
borrowed
or
devised
which
on
the
common
belief
have
wrought
no
small
impression
defended
by
many
denied
utterly
by
few
the
principal
authority
is
geoffrey
of
monmouth
whose
history
written
in
the
twelfth
century
purports
to
be
a
translation
of
a
history
of
britain
brought
over
from
the
opposite
shore
of
france
which
under
the
name
of
brittany
was
chiefly
peopled
by
natives
of
britain
who
from
time
to
time
emigrated
thither
driven
from
their
own
country
by
the
inroads
of
the
picts
and
scots
according
to
this
authority
brutus
was
the
son
of
silvius
and
he
of
ascanius
the
son
of
aeneas
whose
flight
from
troy
and
settlement
in
italy
are
narrated
in
stories
of
gods
and
heroes
brutus
at
the
age
of
fifteen
attending
his
father
to
the
chase
unfortunately
killed
him
with
an
arrow
banished
therefor
by
his
kindred
he
sought
refuge
in
that
part
of
greece
where
helenus
with
a
band
of
trojan
exiles
had
become
established
but
helenus
was
now
dead
and
the
descendants
of
the
trojans
were
oppressed
by
pandrasus
the
king
of
the
country
brutus
being
kindly
received
among
them
so
throve
in
virtue
and
in
arms
as
to
win
the
regard
of
all
the
eminent
of
the
land
above
all
others
of
his
age
in
consequence
of
this
the
trojans
not
only
began
to
hope
but
secretly
to
persuade
him
to
lead
them
the
way
to
liberty
to
encourage
them
they
had
the
promise
of
help
from
assaracus
a
noble
greek
youth
whose
mother
was
a
trojan
he
had
suffered
wrong
at
the
hands
of
the
king
and
for
that
reason
the
more
willingly
cast
in
his
lost
with
the
trojan
exiles
choosing
a
fit
opportunity
brutus
with
his
countrymen
withdrew
to
the
woods
and
hills
as
the
safest
place
from
which
to
expostulate
and
sent
this
message
to
pandrasus
that
the
trojans
holding
it
unworthy
of
their
ancestors
to
serve
in
a
foreign
land
had
retreated
to
the
woods
choosing
rather
a
savage
life
than
a
slavish
one
if
that
displeased
him
then
with
his
leave
they
would
depart
to
some
other
country
pandrasus
not
expecting
so
bold
a
message
from
the
sons
of
captives
went
in
pursuit
of
them
with
such
forces
as
he
could
gather
and
met
them
on
the
banks
of
the
achelous
where
brutus
got
the
advantage
and
took
the
king
captive
the
result
was
that
the
terms
demanded
by
the
trojans
were
granted
the
king
gave
his
daughter
imogen
in
marriage
to
brutus
and
furnished
shipping
money
and
fit
provision
for
them
all
to
depart
from
the
land
the
marriage
being
solemnized
and
shipping
from
all
parts
got
together
the
trojans
in
a
fleet
of
no
less
than
three
hundred
and
twenty
sail
betook
themselves
to
the
sea
on
the
third
day
they
arrived
at
a
certain
island
which
they
found
destitute
of
inhabitants
though
there
were
appearances
of
former
habitation
and
among
the
ruins
a
temple
of

here
performing

at

sped
his
course

etc
if
our
readers
ask
when
all
this
took
place
we
must
answer
in
the
first
place
that
mythology
is
not
careful
of
dates
and
next
that
as
brutus
was
the
of
aeneas
it
must
have
been
not
far
from
a
century
subsequent
to
the
trojan
war
or
about
eleven
hundred
years
before
the
invasion
of
the
island
by
julius
caesar
this
long
interval
is
filled
with
the
names
of
princes
whose
chief
occupation
was
in
warring
with
one
another
some
few
whose
names
remain
connected
with
places

embalmed

will
mention

invention
and
practised
the
arts
of
magic
till
having
made
him
wings
to
fly
he
fell
down
upon
the
temple
of
apollo
in
trinovant
and
so
died
after
twenty
years
reign
leir
leir
who
next
reigned
built
leicester
and
called
it
after
his
name
he
had
no
male
issue
but
only
three
daughters
when
grown
old
he
determined
to
divide
his
kingdom
among
his
daughters
and
bestow
them
in
marriage
but
first
to
try
which
of
them
loved
him
best
he
determined
to
ask
them
solemnly
in
order
and
judge
of
the
warmth
of
their
affection
by
their
answers
goneril
the
eldest
knowing
well
her
father
weakness
made
answer
that
she
loved
him
above
her
soul
since
thou
so
honorest
my
declining
age
said
the
old
man
to
thee
and
to
thy
husband
i
give
the
third
part
of
my
realm
such
good
success
for
a
few
words
soon
uttered
was
ample
instruction
to
regan
the
second
daughter
what
to
say
she
therefore
to
the
same
question
replied
that
she
loved
him
more
than
all
the
world
beside
and
so
received
an
equal
reward
with
her
sister
but
cordelia
the
youngest
and
hitherto
the
best
beloved
though
having
before
her
eyes
the
reward
of
a
little
easy
soothing
and
the
loss
likely
to
attend
dealing
yet
was
not
moved
from
the
solid
purpose
of
a
sincere
and
virtuous
answer
and
replied
father
my
love
towards
you
is
as
my
duty
bids
they
who
pretend
beyond
this
flatter
when
the
old
man
sorry
to
hear
this
and
wishing
her
to
recall
these
words
persisted
in
asking
she
still
restrained
her
expressions
so
as
to
say
rather
less
than
more
than
the
truth
then
leir
all
in
a
passion
burst
forth
since
thou
hast
not
reverenced
thy
aged
father
like
thy
sisters
think
not
to
have
any
part
in
my
kingdom
or
what
else
i
have
and
without
delay
giving
in
marriage
his
other
daughters
goneril
to
the
duke
of
albany
and
regan
to
the
duke
of
cornwall
he
divides
his
kingdom
between
them
and
goes
to
reside
with
his
eldest
daughter
attended
only
by
a
hundred
knights
but
in
a
short
time
his
attendants
being
complained
of
as
too
numerous
and
disorderly
are
reduced
to
thirty
resenting
that
affront
the
old
king
betakes
him
to
his
second
daughter
but
she
instead
of
soothing
his
wounded
pride
takes
part
with
her
sister
and
refuses
to
admit
a
retinue
of
more
than
five
then
back
he
returns
to
the
other
who
now
will
not
receive
him
with
more
than
one
attendant
then
the
remembrance
of
cordeilla
comes
to
his
thoughts
and
he
takes
his
journey
into
france
to
seek
her
with
little
hope
of
kind
consideration
from
one
whom
he
had
so
injured
but
to
pay
her
the
last
recompense
he
can
render
confession
of
his
injustice
when
cordeilla
is
informed
of
his
approach
and
of
his
sad
condition
she
pours
forth
true
filial
tears
and
not
willing
that
her
own
or
others
eyes
should
see
him
in
that
forlorn
condition
she
sends
one
of
her
trusted
servants
to
meet
him
and
convey
him
privately
to
some
comfortable
abode
and
to
furnish
him
with
such
state
as
befitted
his
dignity
after
which
cordeilla
with
the
king
her
husband
went
in
state
to
meet
him
and
after
an
honorable
reception
the
king
permitted
his
wife
cordeilla
to
go
with
an
army
and
set
her
father
again
upon
his
throne
they
prospered
subdued
the
wicked
sisters
and
their
consorts
and
leir
obtained
the
crown
and
held
it
three
years
cordeilla
succeeded
him
and
reigned
five
years
but
the
sons
of
her
sisters
after
that
rebelled
against
her
and
she
lost
both
her
crown
and
life
shakspeare
has
chosen
this
story
as
the
subject
of
his
tragedy
of
king
lear
varying
its
details
in
some
respects
the
madness
of
leir
and
the
ill
success
of
cordeilla
attempt
to
reinstate
her
father
are
the
principal
variations
and
those
in
the
names
will
also
be
noticed
our
narrative
is
drawn
from
milton
history
and
thus
the
reader
will
perceive
that
the
story
of
leir
has
had
the
distinguished
honor
of
being
told
by
the
two
acknowledged
chiefs
of
british
literature
ferrex
and
porrex
ferrex
and
porrex
were
brothers
who
held
the
kingdom
after
leir
they
quarrelled
about
the
supremacy
and
porrex
expelled
his
brother
who
obtaining
aid
from
suard
king
of
the
franks
returned
and
made
war
upon
porrex
ferrex
was
slain
in
battle
and
his
forces
dispersed
when
their
mother
came
to
hear
of
her
death
who
was
her
favorite
she
fell
into
a
great
rage
and
conceived
a
mortal
hatred
against
the
survivor
she
took
therefore
her
opportunity
when
he
was
asleep
fell
upon
him
and
with
the
assistance
of
her
women
tore
him
in
pieces
this
horrid
story
would
not
be
worth
relating
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
it
has
furnished
the
plot
for
the
first
tragedy
which
was
written
in
the
english
language
it
was
entitled
gorboduc
but
in
the
second
edition
ferrex
and
porrex
and
was
the
production
of
thomas
sackville
afterwards
earl
of
dorset
and
thomas

its
date
was

molmutius
established
the
molmutine
laws
which
bestowed
the
privilege
of
sanctuary
on
temples
cities
and
the

them
and
gave
the

brennus
was

where
he

that
he
gave

and
wisely
after
five
years

one
day
when
hunting
he
met
in
the
forest
his
brother
arthgallo
who
had
been
deposed
after
long
wandering
unable
longer
to
bear
the
poverty
to
which
he
was
reduced
he
had
returned

with

and
embraced
him
he
took
arthgallo
home
with
him
and
concealed
him
in
the
palace
after
this
he
feigned
himself
sick
and
calling

induced
them
partly
by

wordsworth
has
taken
the
story
of

subject
of

greatly
enlarged
trinovant
his
capital
and
surrounded
it
with
a
wall
he
changed
its

his

so
that
henceforth
it
was
called

buried
by

he
had
two
sons
but
they
were
not
old
enough
at
the
time
of
their
father
death
to
sustain
the
cares
of
government
and
therefore
their
uncle
caswallaun
or
cassibellaunus
succeeded
to
the
kingdom
he
was
a
brave
and
magnificent
prince
so
that
his
fame
reached
to
distant
countries
cassibellaunus
about
this
time
it
happened
as
is
found
in
the
roman
histories
that
julius
caesar
having
subdued
gaul
came
to
the
shore
opposite
britain
and
having
resolved
to
add
this
island
also
to
his
conquests
he
prepared
ships
and
transported
his
army
across
the
sea
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
thames
here
he
was
met
by
cassibellaun
with
all
his
forces
and
a
battle
ensued
in
which
nennius
the
brother
of
cassibellaun
engaged
in
single
combat
with
csesar
after
several
furious
blows
given
and
received
the
sword
of
caesar
stuck
so
fast
in
the
shield
of
nennius
that
it
could
not
be
pulled
out
and
the
combatants
being
separated
by
the
intervention
of
the
troops
nennius
remained
possessed
of
this
trophy
at
last
after
the
greater
part
of
the
day
was
spent
the
britons
poured
in
so
fast
that
caesar
was
forced
to
retire
to
his
camp
and
fleet
and
finding
it
useless
to
continue
the
war
any
longer
at
that
time
he
returned
to
gaul
shakspeare

to
cassibellaunus
in

or
cymbeline
caesar
on
a
second
invasion
of
the
island
was
more
fortunate
and
compelled
the
britons
to
pay
tribute
cymbeline
the
nephew
of
the
king
was
delivered
to
the
romans
as
a
hostage
for
the
faithful
fulfilment
of
the
treaty
and
being
carried
to
rome
by
caesar
he
was
there
brought
up
in
the
roman
arts
and
accomplishments
being
afterwards
restored
to
his
country
and
placed
on
the
throne
he
was
attached
to
the
romans
and
continued
through
all
his
reign
at
peace
with
them
his
sons
guiderius
and
arviragus
who
made
their
appearance
in
shakspeare
play
of
cymbeline
succeeded
their
father
and
refusing
to
pay
tribute
to
the
romans
brought
on
another
invasion
guiderius
was
slain
but
arviragus
afterward
made
terms
with
the
romans
and
reigned
prosperously
many
years
armorica
the
next
event
of
note
is
the
conquest
and
colonization
of
armorica
by
maximus
a
roman
general
and
conan
lord
of
miniadoc
or
in
wales
the
name
of
the
country
was
changed
to
brittany
or
lesser
britain
and
so
completely
was
it
possessed
by
the
british
colonists
that
the
language
became
assimilated
to
that
spoken
in
wales
and
it
is
said
that
to
this
day
the
peasantry
of
the
two
countries
can
understand
each
other
when
speaking
their
native
language
the
romans
eventually
succeeded
in
establishing
themselves
in
the
island
and
after
the
lapse
of
several
generations
they
became
blended
with
the
natives
so
that
no
distinction
existed
between
the
two
races
when
at
length
the
roman
armies
were
withdrawn
from
britain
their
departure
was
a
matter
of
regret
to
the
inhabitants
as
it
left
them
without
protection
against
the
barbarous
tribes
scots
picts
and
norwegians
who
harassed
the
country
incessantly
this
was
the
state
of
things
when
the
era
of
king
arthur
began
the
adventure
of

pass
into

to
fight
with

vanquish

slain
chapter
iii
merlin
merlin
was
the
son
of
no
mortal
father
but
of
an
incubus
one
of
a
class
of
beings
not
absolutely
wicked
but
far
from
good
who
inhabit
the
regions
of
the
air
merlin
mother
was
a
virtuous
young
woman
who
on
the
birth
of
her
son
intrusted
him
to
a
priest
who
hurried
him
to
the
baptismal
fount
and
so
saved
him
from
sharing
the
lot
of
his
father
though
he
retained
many
marks
of
his
unearthly
origin
at
this
time
vortigern
reigned
in
britain
he
was
a
usurper
who
had
caused
the
death
of
his
sovereign
moines
and
driven
the
two
brothers
of
the
late
king
whose
names
were
uther
and
pendragon
into
banishment
vortigern
who
lived
in
constant
fear
of
the
return
of
the
rightful
heirs
of
the
kingdom
began
to
erect
a
strong
tower
for
defence
the
edifice
when
brought
by
the
workmen
to
a
certain
height
three
times
fell
to
the
ground
without
any
apparent
cause
the
king
consulted
his
astrologers
on
this
wonderful
event
and
learned
from
them
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
bathe
the
of
the
foundation
with
the
blood
of
a
child
born
without
a
mortal
father
in
search
of
such
an
infant
vortigern
sent
his
messengers
all
over
the
kingdom
and
they
by
accident
discovered
merlin
whose
lineage
seemed
to
point
him
out
as
the
individual
wanted
they
took
him
to
the
king
but
merlin
young
as
he
was
explained
to
the
king
the
absurdity
of
attempting
to
rescue
the
fabric
by
such
means
for
he
told
him
the
true
cause
of
the
instability
of
the
tower
was
its
being
placed
over
the
den
of
two
immense
dragons
whose
combats
shook
the
earth
above
them
the
king
ordered
his
workmen
to
dig
beneath
the
tower
and
when
they
had
done
so
they
discovered
two
enormous
serpents
the
one
white
as
milk
the
other
red
as
fire
the
multitude
looked
on
with
amazement
till
the
serpents
slowly
rising
from
their
den
and
expanding
their
enormous
folds
began
the
combat
when
every
one
fled
in
terror
except
merlin
who
stood
by
clapping
his
hands
and
cheering
on
the
conflict
the
red
dragon
was
slain
and
the
white
one
gliding
through
a
cleft
in
the
rock
disappeared
these
animals
typified
as
merlin
afterwards
explained
the
invasion
of
uther
and
pendragon
the
rightful
princes
who
soon
after
landed
with
a
great
army
vortigern
was
defeated
and
afterwards
burned
alive
in
the
castle
he
had
taken
such
pains
to
construct
on
the
death
of
vortigern
pendragon
ascended
the
throne
merlin
became
his
chief
adviser
and
often
assisted
the
king
by
his
magical
arts
merlin
who
knew
the
range
of
all
their
arts
had
built
the
king
his
havens
ships
and
halls
vivian
among
other
endowments
he
had
the
power
of
transforming
himself
into
any
shape
he
pleased
at
one
time
he
appeared
as
a
dwarf
at
others
as
a
damsel
a
page
or
even
a
greyhound
or
a
stag
this
faculty
he
often
employed
for
the
service
of
the
king
and
sometimes
also
for
the
diversion
of
the
court
and
the
sovereign
merlin
continued
to
be
a
favorite
counsellor
through
the
reigns
of
pendragon
uther
and
arthur
and
at
last
disappeared
from
view
and
was
no
more
found
among
men
through
the
treachery
of
his
mistress
viviane
the
fairy
which
happened
in
this
wise
merlin
having
become
enamoured
of
the
fair
viviane
the
lady
of
the
lake
was
weak
enough
to
impart
to
her
various
important
secrets
of
his
art
being
impelled
by
fatal
destiny
of
which
he
was
at
the
same
time
fully
aware
the
lady
however
was
not
content
with
his
devotion
unbounded
as
it
seems
to
have
been
but
cast
about
the
romance
tells
us
how
she
might
detain
him
for
evermore
and
one
day
addressed
him
in
these
terms
sir
i
would
that
we
should
make
a
fair
place
and
a
suitable
so
contrived
by
art
and
by
cunning
that
it
might
never
be
undone
and
that
you
and
i
should
be
there
in
joy
and
solace
my
lady
said
merlin
i
will
do
all
this
sir
said
she
i
would
not
have
you
do
it
but
you
shall
teach
me
and
i
will
do
it
and
then
it
will
be
more
to
my
mind
i
grant
you
this
said
merlin
then
he
began
to
devise
and
the
damsel
put
it
all
in
writing
and
when
he
had
devised
the
whole
then
had
the
damsel
full
great
joy
and
showed
him
greater
semblance
of
love
than
she
had
ever
before
made
and
they
sojourned
together
a
long
while
at
length
it
fell
out
that
as
they
were
going
one
day
hand
in
hand
through
the
forest
of
breceliande
they
found
a
bush
of
which
was
laden
with
flowers
and
they
seated
themselves
under
the
shade
of
this
upon
the
green
grass
and
merlin
laid
his
head
upon
the
damsel
lap
and
fell
asleep
then
the
damsel
rose
and
made
a
ring
with
her
wimple
round
the
bush
and
round
merlin
and
began
her
enchantments
such
as
he
himself
had
taught
her
and
nine
times
she
made
the
ring
and
nine
times
she
made
the
enchantment
and
then
she
went
and
sat
down
by
him
and
placed
his
head
again
upon
her
lap
and
a
sleep
fell
upon
merlin
more
like
death
so
deep
her
finger
on
her
lips
then
vivian
rose
and
from
her
head
the
wimple
throws
and
takes
it
in
her
hand
and
waves
it
over
the
blossomed
thorn
tree
and
her
sleeping
lover
nine
times
she
waved
the
fluttering
wimple
round
and
made
a
little
plot
of
magic
ground
matthew
arnold
and
when
he
awoke
and
looked
round
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
enclosed
in
the
strongest
tower
in
the
world
and
laid
upon
a
fair
bed
then
said
he
to
the
dame
my
lady
you
have
deceived
me
unless
you
abide
with
me
for
no
one
hath
power
to
unmake
this
tower
but
you
alone
she
then
promised
she
would
be
often
there
and
in
this
she
held
her
covenant
with
him
and
merlin
never
went
out
of
that
tower
where
his
mistress
viviane
had
enclosed
him
but
she
entered
and
went
out
again
when
she
listed
after
this
event
merlin
was
never
more
known
to
hold
converse
with
any
mortal
but
viviane
except
on
one
occasion
arthur
having
for
some
time
missed
him
from
his
court
sent
several
of
his
knights
in
search
of
him
and
among
the
number
sir
gawain
who
met
with
a
very
unpleasant
adventure
while
engaged
in
this
quest
happening
to
pass
a
damsel
on
his
road
and
neglecting
to
salute
her
she
revenged
herself
for
his
incivility
by
transforming
him
into
a
hideous
dwarf
he
was
bewailing
aloud
his
evil
fortune
as
he
went
through
the
forest
of
breceliande
when
suddenly
he
heard
the
voice
of
one
groaning
on
his
right
hand
and
looking
that
way
he
could
see
nothing
save
a
kind
of
smoke
which
seemed
like
air
and
through
which
he
could
not
pass
merlin
then
addressed
him
from
out
the
smoke
and
told
him
by
what
misadventure
he
was
imprisoned
there
ah
sir
he
added
you
will
never
see
me
more
and
that
grieves
me
but
i
can
not
remedy
it
i
shall
never
more
speak
to
you
nor
to
any
other
person
save
only
my
mistress
but
do
thou
hasten
to
king
arthur
and
charge
him
from
me
to
undertake
without
delay
the
quest
of
the
sacred
graal
the
knight
is
already
born
and
has
received
knighthood
at
his
hands
who
is
destined
to
accomplish
this
quest
and
after
this
he
comforted
gawain
under
his
transformation
assuring
him
that
he
should
speedily
be
disenchanted
and
he
predicted
to
him
that
he
should
find
the
king
at
carduel
in
wales
on
his
return
and
that
all
the
other
knights
who
had
been
on
like
quest
would
arrive
there
the
same
day
as
himself
and
all
this
came
to
pass
as
merlin
had
said
merlin
is
frequently
introduced
in
the
tales
of
chivalry
but
it
is
chiefly
on
great
occasions
and
at
a
period
subsequent
to
his
death
or
magical
disappearance
in
the
romantic
poems
of
italy

in

chiefly
represented

chapter
iv
arthur
we
shall
begin
our
history
of
king
arthur
by
giving
those
particulars
of
his
life
which
appear
to
rest
on
historical
evidence
and
then
proceed
to
record
those
legends
concerning
him
which
form
the
earliest
portion
of
british
literature
arthur
was
a
prince
of
the
tribe
of
britons
called
silures
whose
country
was
south
wales
the
son
of
uther
named
pendragon
a
title
given
to
an
elective
sovereign
paramount
over
the
many
kings
of
britain
he
appears
to
have
commenced
his
martial
career
about
the
year
and
was
raised
to
the
pendragonship
about
ten
years
later
he
is
said
to
have
gained
twelve
victories
over
the
saxons
the
most
important
of
them
was
that
of
badon
by
some
supposed
to
be
bath
by
others
berkshire
this
was
the
last
of
his
battles
with
the
saxons
and
checked
their
progress
so
effectually
that
arthur
experienced
no
more
annoyance
from
them
and
reigned
in
peace
until
the
revolt
of
his
nephew
modred
twenty
years
later
which
led
to
the
fatal
battle
of
camlan
in
cornwall
in
modred
was
slain
and
arthur
mortally
wounded
was
conveyed
by
sea
to
glastonbury
where
he
died
and
was
buried
tradition
preserved
the
memory
of
the
place
of
his
interment
within
the
abbey
as
we
are
told
by
giraldus
cambrensis
who
was
present
when
the
grave
was
opened
by
command
of
henry
ii
about
and
saw
the
bones
and
sword
of
the
monarch
and
a
leaden
cross
let
into
his
tombstone
with
the
inscription
in
rude
roman
letters
here
lies
buried
the
famous
king
arthur
in
the
island
avalonia
this
story
has
been
elegantly
versified
by
warton
a
popular
traditional
belief
was
long
entertained
among
the
britons
that
arthur
was
not
dead
but
had
been
carried
off
to
be
healed
of
his
wounds
in
and
that
he
would
reappear
to
avenge
his
countrymen
and
reinstate
them
in
the
sovereignty
of
britain
in

to

renowned
in

who

whether
ever
any
such
reigned
in

hath
been
doubted
heretofore
and
may
again
with
good
reason
modern
critics
however
admit
that
there
was
a

find
proof
of
it
in

the
arthur
of

according
to
owen
a
welsh
scholar
and
antiquarian
is
a
mythological
person
arthur
he
says
is
the
great
bear
as
the
name
literally
implies
arctos
arcturus
and
perhaps
this
constellation
being
so
near
the

the
origin

he
was
killed
by

vortigern
was
soon

defeated
in
a
great
battle
by
uther
and
pendragon
the
surviving
brothers
of
moines
and
pendragon
ascended
the
throne
this
prince
had
great
confidence
in
the
wisdom
of
merlin
and
made
him
his
chief
adviser
about
this
time
a
dreadful
war
arose
between
the
saxons
and
britons
merlin
obliged
the
royal
brothers
to
swear
fidelity
to
each
other
but
predicted
that
one
of
them
must
fall
in
the
first
battle
the
saxons
were
routed
and
pendragon
being
slain
was
succeeded
by
uther
who
now
assumed
in
addition
to
his
own
name
the
appellation
of
pendragon
merlin
still
continued
a
favorite
counsellor
at
the
request
of
uther
he
transported
by
magic
art
enormous
stones
from

to
form
the
sepulchre
of
pendragon
these
stones
constitute
the
monument
now
called

merlin
next
proceeded
to
carlisle
to
prepare
the
round
table
at
which
he
seated
an
assemblage
of
the
great
nobles
of
the
country
the
companions
admitted
to
this
high
order
were
bound
by

to

at
the
hazard
of
their

singly
the
most
perilous
adventures
to
lead

a
life
of

had
defeated
the
enemy
unless
night
intervened
and
separated
the
combatants
soon
after
this
institution
the
king
invited
all
his
barons
to
the
celebration
of
a
great
festival
which
he
proposed
holding
annually
at
carlisle
as
the
knights
had
obtained
the
sovereign
permission
to
bring
their
ladies
along
with
them
the
beautiful
igerne
accompanied
her
husband
gorlois
duke
of
tintadel
to
one
of
these
anniversaries
the
king
became
deeply
enamoured
of
the
duchess
and
disclosed
his
passion
but
igerne
repelled
his
advances
and
revealed
his
solicitations
to
her
husband
on
hearing
this
the
duke
instantly
removed
from
court
with
igerne
and
without
taking
leave
of
uther
the
king
complained
to
his
council
of
this
want
of
duty
and
they
decided
that
the
duke
should
be
summoned
to
court
and
if
refractory
should
be
treated
as
a
rebel
as
he
refused
to
obey
the
citation
the
king
carried
war
into
the
estates
of
his
vassal
and
besieged
him
in
the
strong
castle
of
tintadel
merlin
transformed
the
king
into
the
likeness
of
gorlois
and
enabled
him
to
have
many
stolen
interviews
with
igerne
at
length
the
duke
was
killed
in

king
arthur
though
only
fifteen
years
old
at
his
father
death
was
elected
king
at
a
general
meeting
of
the
nobles
it
was
not
done
without
opposition
for
there
were
many
ambitious
competitors
for
while
he
linger
there
a
doubt
that
ever
smoulder
in
the
hearts
of
those
great
lords
and
barons
of
his
realm
flash
forth

into
war

against
him

is
he
that
he
should
rule
us
who
hath
proven
him
king

son
for
lo
we
look
at
him
and
find
nor
face
nor
bearing
limbs
nor
voice
are
like
to
those
of
uther
whom
we
knew
coming
of
arthur
but
bishop
brice
a
person
of
great
sanctity
on

eve
addressed
the
assembly
and

at

solemn
season
to
put
up
their
prayers
for
some
token

should
manifest

was
done

after
exhorting
the
assembly
to
offer
up
their
thanksgiving
for
this
signal
miracle
proposed
a
law
that
whoever
should
be
able
to
draw
out
the
sword
from
the
stone
should
be
acknowledged
as
sovereign
of
the
britons
and
his
proposal
was
decreed
by
general
acclamation
the
tributary
kings
of
uther
and
the
most
famous
knights
successively
put
their
strength
to
the
proof
but
the
miraculous
sword
resisted
all
their
efforts
it
stood
till
candlemas
it
stood
till
easter
and
till
pentecost
when
the
best
knights
in
the
kingdom
usually
assembled
for
the
annual
tournament
arthur
who
was
at
that
time
serving
in
the
capacity
of
squire
to
his
sir
kay
attended
his
master
to
the
lists
sir
kay
fought
with
great
valor
and
success
but
had
the
misfortune
to
break
his
sword
and
sent
arthur
to
his
mother
for
a
new
one
arthur
hastened
home
but
did
not
find
the
lady
but
having
observed
near
the
church
a
sword
sticking
in
a
stone
he
galloped
to
the
place
drew
out
the
sword
with
great
ease
and
delivered
it
to
his
master
sir
kay
would
willingly
have
assumed
to
himself
the
distinction
conferred
by
the
possession
of
the
sword
but
when
to
confirm
the
doubters
the
sword
was
replaced
in
the
stone
he
was
utterly
unable
to
withdraw
it
and
it
would
yield
a
second
time
to
no
hand
but
arthur
thus
decisively
pointed
out
by
heaven
as
their
king
arthur
was
by
general
consent
proclaimed
as
such
and
an
early
day
appointed
for
his
solemn
coronation
immediately
after
his
election
to
the
crown
arthur
found
himself
opposed
by
eleven
kings
and
one
duke
who
with
a
vast
army
were
actually
encamped
in
the
forest
of
rockingham
by
merlin
advice
arthur
sent
an
embassy
to
brittany
to
solicit
the
aid
of
king
ban
and
king
bohort
two
of
the
best
knights
in
the
world
they
accepted
the
call
and
with
a
powerful
army
crossed
the
sea
landing
at
portsmouth
where
they
were
received
with
great
rejoicing
the
rebel
kings
were
still
superior
in
numbers
but
merlin
by
a
powerful
enchantment
caused
all
their
tents
to
fall
down
at
once
and
in
the
confusion
arthur
with
his
allies
fell
upon
them
and
totally
routed
them
after
defeating
the
rebels
arthur
took
the
field
against
the
saxons
as
they
were
too
strong
for
him
unaided
he
sent
an
embassy
to
armorica
beseeching
the
assistance
of
hoel
who
soon
after
brought
over
an
army
to
his
aid
the
two
kings
joined
their
forces
and
sought
the
enemy
whom
they
met
and
both
sides
prepared
for
a
decisive
engagement
arthur
himself
as
geoffrey
of
monmouth
relates
dressed
in
a
breastplate
worthy
of
so
great
a
king
places
on
his
head
a
golden
helmet
engraved
with
the
semblance
of
a
dragon
over
his
shoulders
he
throws
his
shield
called
priwen
on
which
a
picture
of
the
holy
virgin
constantly
recalled
her
to
his
memory
girt
with
caliburn
a
most
excellent
sword
and
fabricated
in
the
isle
of
avalon
he
graces
his
right
hand
with
the
lance
named
ron
this
was
a
long
and
broad
spear
well
contrived
for
slaughter
after
a
severe
conflict
arthur
calling
on
the
name
of
the
virgin
rushes
into
the
midst
of
his
enemies
and
destroys
multitudes
of
them
with
the
formidable
caliburn
and
puts
the
rest
to
flight
hoel
being
detained
by
sickness
took
no
part
in
this
battle
this
is
called
the
victory
of
mount
badon
and
however
disguised
by
fable
it
is
regarded
by
historians
as
a
real
event
the
feats
performed
by
arthur
at
the
battle
of
badon
mount
are
thus
celebrated
in
drayton
verse
they
sung
how
he
himself
at
badon
bore
that
day
when
at
the
glorious

his
british

merlin
had
planned
for
arthur
a
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
king
laodegan
of
carmalide
by
his
advice
arthur
paid
a
visit
to
the
court
of
that
sovereign
attended
only
by
merlin
and
by
nine
knights
whom
the
magician
had
selected
for
that
service
on
their
arrival
they
found
laodegan
and
his
peers
sitting
in
council
endeavoring
but
with
small
prospect
of
success
to
devise
means
of
resisting
the
impending
attack
of
ryence
king
of
ireland
who
with
fifteen
tributary
kings
and
an
almost
innumerable
army
had
nearly
surrounded
the
city
merlin
who
acted
as
leader
of
the
band
of
british
knights
announced
them
as
strangers
who
came
to
offer
the
king
their
services
in
his
wars
but
under
the
express
condition
that
they
should
be
at
liberty
to
conceal
their
names
and
quality
until
they
should
think
proper
to
divulge
them
these
terms
were
thought
very
strange
but
were
thankfully
accepted
and
the
strangers
after
taking
the
usual
oath
to
the
king
retired
to
the
lodging
which
merlin
had
prepared
for
them
a
few
days
after
this
the
enemy
regardless
of
a
truce
into
which
they
had
entered
with
king
laodegan
suddenly
issued
from
their
camp
and
made
an
attempt
to
surprise
the
city
cleodalis
the
king
general
assembled
the
royal
forces
with
all
possible
despatch
arthur
and
his
companions
also
flew
to
arms
and
merlin
appeared
at
their
head
bearing
a
standard
on
which
was
emblazoned
a
terrific
dragon
merlin
advanced
to
the
gate
and
commanded
the
porter
to
open
it
which
the
porter
refused
to
do
without
the
king
order
merlin
thereupon
took
up
the
gate
with
all
its
appurtenances
of
locks
bars
bolts
and
directed
his
troops
to
pass
through
after
which
he
replaced
it
in
perfect
order
he
then
set
spurs
to
his
horse
and
dashed
at
the
head
of
his
little
troop
into
a
body
of
two
thousand
pagans
the
disparity
of
numbers
being
so
enormous
merlin
cast
a
spell
upon
the
enemy
so
as
to
prevent
their
seeing
the
small
number
of
their
assailants
notwithstanding
which
the
british
knights
were
hard
pressed
but
the
people
of
the
city
who
saw
from
the
walls
this
unequal
contest
were
ashamed
of
leaving
the
small
body
of
strangers
to
their
fate
so
they
opened
the
gate
and
sallied
forth
the
numbers
were
now
more
nearly
equal
and
merlin
revoked
his
spell
so
that
the
two
armies
encountered
on
fair
terms
where
arthur
ban
bohort
and
the
rest
fought
the
king
army
had
the
advantage
but
in
another
part
of
the
field
the
king
himself
was
surrounded
and
carried
off
by
the
enemy
the
sad
sight
was
seen
by
guenever
the
fair
daughter
of
the
king
who
stood
on
the
city
wall
and
looked
at
the
battle
she
was
in
dreadful
distress
tore
her
hair
and
swooned
away
but
merlin
aware
of
what
passed
in
every
part
of
the
field
suddenly
collected
his
knights
led
them
out
of
the
battle
intercepted
the
passage
of
the
party
who
were
carrying
away
the
king
charged
them
with
irresistible
impetuosity
cut
in
pieces
or
dispersed
the
whole
escort
and
rescued
the
king
in
the
fight
arthur
encountered
caulang
a
giant
fifteen
feet
high
and
the
fair
guenever
who
had
already
began
to
feel
a
strong
interest
in
the
handsome
young
stranger
trembled
for
the
issue
of
the
contest
but
arthur
dealing
a
dreadful
blow
on
the
shoulder
of
the
monster
cut
through
his
neck
so
that
his
head
hung
over
on
one
side
and
in
this
condition
his
horse
carried
him
about
the
field
to
the
great
horror
and
dismay
of
the
pagans
guenever
could
not
refrain
from
expressing
aloud
her
wish
that
the
gentle
knight
who
dealt
with
giants
so
dexterously
were
destined
to
become
her
husband
and
the
wish
was
echoed
by
her
attendants
the
enemy
soon
turned
their
backs
and
fled
with
precipitation
closely
pursued
by
laodegan
and
his
allies
after
the
battle
arthur
was
disarmed
and
conducted
to
the
bath
by
the
princess
guenever
while
his
friends
were
attended
by
the
other
ladies
of
the
court
after
the
bath
the
knights
were
conducted
to
a
magnificent
entertainment
at
which
they
were
diligently
served
by
the
same
fair
attendants
laodegan
more
and
more
anxious
to
know
the
name
and
quality
of
his
generous
deliverers
and
occasionally
forming
a
secret
wish
that
the
chief
of
his
guests
might
be
captivated
by
the
charms
of
his
daughter
appeared
silent
and
pensive
and
was
scarcely
roused
from
his
reverie
by
the
banters
of
his
courtiers
arthur
having
had
an
opportunity
of
explaining
to
guenever
his
great
esteem
for
her
merit
was
in
the
joy
of
his
heart
and
was
still
further
delighted
by
hearing
from
merlin
the
late
exploits
of
gawain
at
london
by
means
of
which
his
immediate
return
to
his
dominions
was
rendered
unnecessary
and
he
was
left
at
liberty
to
protract
his
stay
at
the
court
of
laodegan
every
day
contributed
to
increase
the
admiration
of
the
whole
court
for
the
gallant
strangers
and
the
passion
of
guenever
for
their
chief
and
when
at
last
merlin
announced
to
the
king
that
the
object
of
the
visit
of
the
party
was
to
procure
a
bride
for
their
leader
laodegan
at
once
presented
guenever
to
arthur
telling
him
that
whatever
might
be
his
rank
his
merit
was
sufficient
to
entitle
him
to
the
possession
of
the
heiress
of
carmalide
and
could
he
find
a
woman
in
her
womanhood
as
great
as
he
was
in
his
manhood
the
twain
together
might
change
the
world
guinevere
arthur
accepted
the
lady
with
the
utmost
gratitude
and
merlin
then
proceeded
to
satisfy
the
king
of
the
rank
of
his
upon
which
laodegan
with
all
his
barons
hastened
to
do
homage
to
their
lawful
sovereign
the
successor
of
uther
pendragon
the
fair
guenever
was
then
solemnly
betrothed
to
arthur
and
a
magnificent
festival
was
proclaimed
which
lasted
seven
days
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
enemy
appearing
again
with
renewed
force
it
became
necessary
to
resume
military
operations
footnote
guenever
the
name
of
arthur
queen
also
written
genievre
and
geneura
is
familiar
to
all
who
are
conversant
with
chivalric
lore
it
is
to
her
adventures
and
those
of
her
true
knight
sir
launcelot
that
dante
alludes
in
the
beautiful
episode
of
francesca
di
rimini
we
must
now
relate
what
took
place
at
and
near
london
while
arthur
was
absent
from
his
capital
at
this
very
time
a
band
of
young
heroes
were
on
their
way
to
arthur
court
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
knighthood
from
him
they
were
gawain
and
his
three
brothers
nephews
of
arthur
sons
of
king
lot
and
galachin
another
nephew
son
of
king
nanters
king
lot
had
been
one
of
the
rebel
chiefs
whom
arthur
had
defeated
but
he
now
hoped
by
means
of
the
young
men
to
be
reconciled
to
his
he
equipped
his
sons
and
his
nephew
with
the
utmost
magnificence
giving
them
a
splendid
retinue
of
young
men
sons
of
earls
and
barons
all
mounted
on
the
best
horses
with
complete
suits
of
choice
armor
they
numbered
in
all
seven
hundred
but
only
nine
had
yet
received
the
order
of
knighthood
the
rest
were
candidates
for
that
honor
and
anxious
to
earn
it
by
an
early
encounter
with
the
enemy
gawain
the
leader
was
a
knight
of
wonderful
strength
but
what
was
most
remarkable
about
him
was
that
his
strength
was
greater
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
than
at
others
from
nine
till
noon
his
strength
was
doubled
and
so
it
was
from
three
to
evensong
for
the
rest
of
the
time
it
was
less
remarkable
though
at
all
times
surpassing
that
of
ordinary
men
after
a
march
of
three
days
they
arrived
in
the
vicinity
of
london
where
they
expected
to
find
arthur
and
his
court
and
very
unexpectedly
fell
in
with
a
large
convoy
belonging
to
the
enemy
consisting
of
numerous
carts
and
wagons
all
loaded
with
provisions
and
escorted
by
three
thousand
men
who
had
been
collecting
spoil
from
all
the
country
round
a
single
charge
from
gawain
impetuous
cavalry
was
sufficient
to
disperse
the
escort
and
recover
the
convoy
which
was
instantly
despatched
to
london
but
before
long
a
body
of
seven
thousand
fresh
soldiers
advanced
to
the
attack
of
the
five
princes
and
their
little
army
gawain
singling
out
a
chief
named
choas
of
gigantic
size
began
the
battle
by
splitting
him
from
the
crown
of
the
head
to
the
breast
galachin
encountered
king
sanagran
who
was
also
very
huge
and
cut
off
his
head
agrivain
and
gahariet
also
performed
prodigies
of
valor
thus
they
kept
the
great
army
of
assailants
at
bay
though
hard
pressed
till
of
a
sudden
they
perceived
a
strong
body
of
the
citizens
advancing
from
london
where
the
convoy
which
had
been
recovered
by
gawain
had
arrived
and
informed
the
mayor
and
citizens
of
the
danger
of
their
deliverer
the
arrival
of
the
londoners
soon
decided
the
contest
the
enemy
fled
in
all
directions
and
gawain
and
his
friends
escorted
by
the
grateful
citizens
entered
london
and
were
received
with
acclamations
chapter
v
arthur
continued
after
the
great
victory
of
mount
badon
by
which
the
saxons
were
for
the
time
effectually
put
down
arthur
turned
his
arms
against
the
scots
and
picts
whom
he
routed
at
lake
lomond
and
compelled
to
sue
for
mercy
he
then
went
to
york
to
keep
his
christmas
and
employed
himself
in
restoring
the
christian
churches
which
the
pagans
had
rifled
and
overthrown
the
following
summer
he
conquered
ireland
and
then
made
a
voyage
with
his
fleet
to
iceland
which
he
also
subdued
the
kings
of
gothland
and
of
the
orkneys
came
voluntarily
and
made
their
submission
promising
to
pay
tribute
then
he
returned
to
britain
where
having
established
the
kingdom
he
dwelt
twelve
years
in
peace
during
this
time
he
invited
over
to
him
all
persons
whatsoever
that
were
famous
for
valor
in
foreign
nations
and
augmented
the
number
of
his
domestics
and
introduced
such
politeness
into
his
court
as
people
of
the
remotest
countries
thought
worthy
of
their
imitation
so
that
there
was
not
a
nobleman
who
thought
himself
of
any
consideration
unless
his
clothes
and
arms
were
made
in
the
same
fashion
as
those
of
arthur
knights
finding
himself
so
powerful
at
home
arthur
began
to
form
designs
for
extending
his
power
abroad
so
having
prepared
his
fleet
he
first
attempted
norway
that
he
might
procure
the
crown
of
it
for
lot
his
sister
husband
arthur
landed
in
norway
fought
a
great
battle
with
the
king
of
that
country
defeated
him
and
pursued
the
victory
till
he
had
reduced
the
whole
country
under
his
dominion
and
established
lot
upon
the
throne
then
arthur
made
a
voyage
to
gaul
and
laid
siege
to
the
city
of
paris
gaul
was
at
that
time
a
roman
province
and
governed
by
flollo
the
tribune
when
the
siege
of
paris
had
continued
a
month
and
the
people
began
to
suffer
from
famine
flollo
challenged
arthur
to
single
combat
proposing
to
decide
the
conquest
of
the
province
in
that
way
arthur
gladly
accepted
the
challenge
and
slew
his
adversary
in
the
contest
upon
which
the
citizens
surrendered
the
city
to
him
after
the
victory
arthur
divided
his
army
into
two
parts
one
of
which
he
committed
to
the
conduct
of
hoel
whom
he
ordered
to
march
into
aquitaine
while
he
with
the
other
part
should
endeavor
to
subdue
the
other
provinces
at
the
end
of
nine
years
in
which
time
all
the
parts
of
gaul
were
entirely
reduced
arthur
returned
to
paris
where
he
kept
his
court
and
calling
an
assembly
of
the
clergy
and
people
established
peace
and
the
just
administration
of
the
laws
in
that
kingdom
then
he
bestowed
normandy
upon
bedver
his
butler
and
the
province
of
andegavia
upon
kay
his
steward
footnote
this
name
in
the
french
romances
is
spelled
queux
which
means
head
cook
this
would
seem
to
imply
that
it
was
a
title
and
not
a
name
yet
the
personage
who
bore
it
is
never
mentioned
by
any
other
he
is
the
chief
if
not
the
only
comic
character
among
the
heroes
of
arthur
court
he
is
the
seneschal
or
steward
his
duties
also
embracing
those
of
chief
of
the
cooks
in
the
romances
his
general
character
is
a
compound
of
valor
and
buffoonery
always
ready
to
fight
and
generally
getting
the
worst
of
the
battle
he
is
also
sarcastic
and
abusive
in
his
remarks
by
which
he
often
gets
into
trouble
yet
arthur
seems
to
have
an
attachment
to
him
and
often
takes
his
advice
which
is
generally
wrong
and
several
other
provinces
upon
his
great
men
that
attended
him
and
having
settled
the
peace
of
the
cities
and
countries
he
returned
back
in
the
beginning
of
spring
to
britain
upon
the
approach
of
the
feast
of
pentecost
arthur
the
better
to
demonstrate
his
joy
after
such
triumphant
successes
and
for
the
more
solemn
observation
of
that
festival
and
reconciling
the
minds
of
the
princes
that
were
now
subject
to
him
resolved
during
that
season
to
hold
a
magnificent
court
to
place
the
crown
upon
his
head
and
to
invite
all
the
kings
and
dukes
under
his
subjection
to
the
solemnity
and
he
pitched
upon
caerleon
the
city
of
legions
as
the
proper
place
for
his
purpose
for
besides
its
great
wealth
above
the
other
cities
its
situation
upon
the
river
usk
near
the
severn
sea
was
most
pleasant
and
fit
for
so
great
a
solemnity
for
on
one
side
it
was
washed
by
that
noble
river
so
that
the
kings
and
princes
from
the
countries
beyond
the
seas
might
have
the
convenience
of
sailing
up
to
it
on
the
other
side
the
beauty
of
the
meadows
and
groves
and
magnificence
of
the
royal
palaces
with
lofty
gilded
roofs
that
adorned
it
made
it
even
rival
the
grandeur
of
rome
it
was
also
famous
for
two
churches
whereof
one
was
adorned
with
a
choir
of
virgins
who
devoted
themselves
wholly
to
the
service
of
god
and
the
other
maintained
a
convent
of
priests
besides
there
was
a
college
of
two
hundred
philosophers
who
being
learned
in
astronomy
and
the
other
arts
were
diligent
in
observing
the
courses
of
the
stars
and
gave
arthur
true
predictions
of
the
events
that
would
happen
in
this
place
therefore
which
afforded
such
delights
were
preparations
made
for
the
ensuing
festival

were
then
sent
into
several

to

with
his
nobility
who
came
with
such
a
train
of
mules
horses
and
rich
furniture
as
it
is
difficult
to
describe
besides
these
there
remained
no
prince
of
any
consideration
on
this
side
of
spain
who
came
not
upon
this
invitation
and
no
wonder
when
arthur
munificence
which
was
celebrated
over
the
whole
world
made
him
beloved
by
all
people
when
all
were
assembled
upon
the
day
of
the
solemnity
the
archbishops
were
conducted
to
the
palace
in
order
to
place
the
crown
upon
the
king
head
then
dubricius
inasmuch
as
the
court
was
held
in
his
diocese
made
himself
ready
to
celebrate
the
office
as
soon
as
the
king
was
invested
with
his
royal
habiliments
he
was
conducted
in
great
pomp
to
the
metropolitan
church
having
four
kings
of
albania
cornwall
demetia
and
venedotia
bearing
four
golden
swords
before
him
on
another
part
was
the
queen
dressed
out
in
her
richest
ornaments
conducted
by
the
archbishops
and
bishops
to
the
church
of
virgins
the
four
queens
also
of
the
kings
last
mentioned
bearing
before
her
four
white
doves
according
to
ancient
custom
when
the
whole
procession
was
ended
so
transporting
was
the
harmony
of
the
musical
instruments
and
voices
whereof
there
was
a
vast
variety
in
both
churches
that
the
knights
who
attended
were
in
doubt
which
to
prefer
and
therefore
crowded
from
the
one
to
the
other
by
turns
and
were
far
from
being
tired
of
the
solemnity
though
the
whole
day
had
been
spent
in
it
at
last
when
divine
service
was
over
at
both
churches
the
king
and
queen
put
off
their
crowns
and
putting
on
their
lighter
ornaments
went
to
the
banquet
when
they
had
all
taken
their
seats
according
to
precedence
kay
the
sewer
in
rich
robes
of
ermine
with
a
thousand
young
noblemen
all
in
like
manner
clothed
in
rich
attire
served
up
the
dishes
from
another
part
bedver
the
butler
was
followed
by
the
same
number
of
attendants
who
waited
with
all
kinds
of
cups
and
and
there
was
food
and
drink
in
abundance
and
everything
was
of
the
best
kind
and
served
in
the
best
manner
for
at
that
time
britain
had
arrived
at
such
a
pitch
of
grandeur
that
in
riches
luxury
and
politeness
it
far
surpassed
all
other
kingdoms
as
soon
as
the
banquets
were
over
they
went
into
the
fields
without
the
city
to
divert
themselves
with
various
sports
such
as
shooting
with
bows
and
arrows
tossing
the
pike
casting
of
heavy
stones
and
rocks
playing
at
dice
and
the
like
and
all
these
inoffensively
and
without
quarrelling
in
this
manner
were
three
days
spent
and
after
that
they
separated
and
the
kings
and
noblemen
departed
to
their
several
homes
after
this
arthur
reigned
five
years
in
peace
then
came
ambassadors
from
lucius
tiberius
procurator
under
leo
emperor
of
rome
demanding
tribute
but
arthur
refused
to
pay
tribute
and
prepared
for
war
as
soon
as
the
necessary
dispositions
were
made
he
committed
the
government
of
his
kingdom
to
his
nephew
modred
and
to
queen
guenever
and
marched
with
his
army
to
hamo
port
where
the
wind
stood
fair
for
him
the
army
crossed
over
in
safety
and
landed
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
barba
and
there
they
pitched
their
tents
to
wait
the
arrival
of
the
kings
of
the
islands
as
soon
as
all
the
forces
were
arrived
arthur
marched
forward
to
augustodunum
and
encamped
on
the
banks
of
the
river
alba
here
repeated
battles
were
fought
in
all
which
the
britons
under
their
valiant
leaders
hoel
duke
of
armorica
and
gawain
nephew
to
arthur
had
the
advantage
at
length
lucius
tiberius
determined
to
retreat
and
wait
for
the
emperor
leo
to
join
him
with
fresh
troops
but
arthur
anticipating
this
event
took
possession
of
a
certain
valley
and
closed
up
the
way
of
retreat
to
lucius
compelling
him
to
fight
a
decisive
battle
in
which
arthur
lost
some
of
the
bravest
of
his
knights
and
most
faithful
followers
but
on
the
other
hand
lucius
tiberius
was
slain
and
his
army
totally
defeated
the
fugitives
dispersed
over
the
country
some
to
the
and
woods
some
to
cities
and
towns
and
all
other
places
where
they
could
hope
for
safety
arthur
stayed
in
those
parts
till
the
next
winter
was
over
and
employed
his
time
in
restoring
order
and
settling
the
government
he
then
returned
into
england
and
celebrated
his
victories
with
great
splendor
then
the
king
stablished
all
his
knights
and
to
them
that
were
not
rich
he
gave
lands
and
charged
them
all
never
to
do
outrage
nor
murder
and
always
to
flee
treason
also
by
no
means
to
be
cruel
but
to
give
mercy
unto
him
that
asked
mercy
upon
pain
of
forfeiture
of
their
worship
and
lordship
and
always
to
do
ladies
damosels
and
gentlewomen
service
upon
pain
of
death
also
that
no
man
take
battle
in
a
wrongful
quarrel
for
no
law
nor
for
any
world
goods
unto
this
were
all
the
knights
sworn
of
the
table
round
both
old
and
young
and
at
every
year
were
they
sworn
at
the
high
feast
of
pentecost
king
arthur
slays
the
giant
of
michael
mount
while
the
army
was
encamped
in
brittany
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
kings
there
came
a
countryman
to
arthur
and
told
him
that
a
giant
whose
cave
was
on
a
neighboring
mountain
called
michael
mount
had
for
a
long
time
been
accustomed
to
carry
off
the
children
of
the
peasants
to
devour
them
and
now
he
hath
taken
the
duchess
of
brittany
as
she
rode
with
her
attendants
and
hath
carried
her
away
in
spite
of
all
they
could
do
now
fellow
said
king
arthur
canst
thou
bring
me
there
where
this
giant
haunteth
yea
sure
said
the
good
man
lo
yonder
where
thou
seest
two
great
fires
there
shalt
thou
find
him
and
more
treasure
than
i
suppose
is
in
all
france
beside
then
the
king
called
to
him
sir
bedver
and
sir
kay
and
commanded
them
to
make
ready
horse
and
harness
for
himself
and
them
for
after
evening
he
would
ride
on
pilgrimage
to
michael
mount
so
they
three
departed
and
rode
forth
till
they
came
to
the
foot
of
the
mount
and
there
the
king
commanded
them
to
tarry
for
he
would
himself
go
up
into
that
mount
so
he
ascended
the
hill
till
he
came
to
a
great
fire
and
there
he
found
an
aged
woman
sitting
by
a
grave
making
great
sorrow
then
king
arthur
saluted
her
and
demanded
of
her
wherefore
she
made
such
lamentation
to
whom
she
answered
sir
knight
speak
low
for
yonder
is
a
devil
and
if
he
hear
thee
speak
he
will
come
and
destroy
thee
for
ye
can
not
make
resistance
to
him
he
is
so
fierce
and
so
strong
he
hath
murdered
the
duchess
which
here
lieth
who
was
the
fairest
of
all
the
world
wife
to
sir
hoel
duke
of
brittany
dame
said
the
king
i
come
from
the
noble
conqueror
king
arthur
to
treat
with
that
tyrant
fie
on
such
treaties
said
she
he
setteth
not
by
the
king
nor
by
no
man
else
well
said
arthur
i
will
accomplish
my
message
for
all
your
fearful
words
so
he
went
forth
by
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
saw
where
the
giant
sat
at
supper
gnawing
on
the
limb
of
a
man
and
baking
his
broad
limbs
at
the
fire
and
three
fair
damsels
lying
bound
whose
lot
it
was
to
be
devoured
in
their
turn
when
king
arthur
beheld
that
he
had
great
compassion
on
them
so
that
his
heart
bled
for
sorrow
then
he
hailed
the
giant
saying
he
that
all
the
world
ruleth
give
thee
short
life
and
shameful
death
why
hast
thou
murdered
this
duchess
therefore
come
forth
for
this
day
thou
shalt
die
by
my
hand
then
the
giant
started
up
and
took
a
great
club
and
smote
at
the
king
and
smote
off
his
coronal
and
then
the
king
struck
him
in
the
belly
with
his
sword
and
made
a
fearful
wound
then
the
giant
threw
away
his
club
and
caught
the
king
in
his
arms
so
that
he
crushed
his
ribs
then
the
three
maidens
kneeled
down
and
prayed
for
help
and
comfort
for
arthur
and
arthur
weltered
and
wrenched
so
that
he
was
one
while
under
and
another
time
above
and
so
weltering
and
wallowing
they
rolled
down
the
hill
and
ever
as
they
weltered
arthur
smote
him
with
his
dagger
and
it
fortuned
they
came
to
the
place
where
the
two
knights
were
and
when
they
saw
the
king
fast
in
the
giant
arms
they
came
and
loosed
him
then
the
king
commanded
sir
kay
to
smite
off
the
giant
head
and
to
set
it
on
the
truncheon
of
a
spear
and
fix
it
on
the
barbican
that
all
the
people
might
see
and
behold
it
this
was
done
and
anon
it
was
known
through
all
the
country
wherefor
the
people
came
and
thanked
the
king
and
he
said
give
your
thanks
to
god
and
take
ye
the
giant
spoil
and
divide
it
among
you
and
king
arthur
caused
a
church
to
be
builded
on
that
hill
in
honor
of
michael
king
arthur
gets
a
sword
from
the
lady
of
the
lake
one
day
king
arthur
rode
forth
and
on
a
sudden
he
was
ware
of
three
churls
chasing
merlin
to
have
slain
him
and
the
king
rode
unto
them
and
bade
them
flee
churls
then
were
they
afraid
when
they
saw
a
knight
and
fled
o
merlin
said
arthur
here
hadst
thou
been
slain
for
all
thy
crafts
had
i
not
been
by
nay
said
merlin
not
so
for
i
could
save
myself
if
i
would
but
thou
art
more
near
thy
death
than
i
am
so
as
they
went
thus
talking
king
arthur
perceived
where
sat
a
knight
on
horseback
as
if
to
guard
the
pass
sir
knight
said
arthur
for
what
cause
abidest
thou
here
then
the
knight
said
there
may
no
knight
ride
this
way
unless
he
just
with
me
for
such
is
the
custom
of
the
pass
i
will
amend
that
custom
said
the
king
then
they
ran
together
and
they
met
so
hard
that
their
spears
were
shivered
then
they
drew
their
swords
and
fought
a
strong
battle
with
many
great
strokes
but
at
length
the
sword
of
the
knight
smote
king
arthur
sword
in
two
pieces
then
said
the
knight
unto
arthur
thou
art
in
my
power
whether
to
save
thee
or
slay
thee
and
unless
thou
yield
thee
as
overcome
and
recreant
thou
shalt
die
as
for
death
said
king
arthur
welcome
be
it
when
it
cometh
but
to
yield
me
unto
thee
as
recreant
i
will
not
then
he
leapt
upon
the
knight
and
took
him
by
the
middle
and
threw
him
down
but
the
knight
was
a
passing
strong
man
and
anon
he
brought
arthur
under
him
and
would
have
razed
off
his
helm
to
slay
him
then
said
merlin
knight
hold
thy
hand
for
this
knight
is
a
man
of
more
worship
than
thou
art
aware
of
why
who
is
he
said
the
knight
it
is
king
arthur
then
would
he
have
slain
him
for
dread
of
his
wrath
and
lifted
up
his
sword
to
slay
him
and
therewith
merlin
cast
an
enchantment
on
the
knight
so
that
he
fell
to
the
earth
in
a
great
sleep
then
merlin
took
up
king
arthur
and
set
him
on
his
horse
alas
said
arthur
what
hast
thou
done
merlin
hast
thou
slain
this
good
knight
by
thy
crafts
care
ye
not
said
merlin
he
is
wholer
than
ye
be
he
is
only
asleep
and
will
wake
in
three
hours
then
the
king
and
he
departed
and
went
till
they
came
to
a
hermit
that
was
a
good
man
and
a
great
leech
so
the
hermit
searched
all
his
wounds
and
applied
good
salves
and
the
king
was
there
three
days
and
then
were
his
wounds
well
amended
that
he
might
ride
and
go
so
they
departed
and
as
they
rode
arthur
said
i
have
no
sword
no
matter
said
merlin
hereby
is
a
sword
that
shall
be
yours
so
they
rode
till
they
came
to
a
lake
which
was
a
fair
water
and
broad
and
in
the
midst
of
the
lake
arthur
was
aware
of
an
arm
clothed
in
white
samite
footnote
samite
a
sort
of
silk
stuff
that
held
a
fair
sword
in
the
hand
lo
said
merlin
yonder
is
that
sword
that
i
spake
of
it
belongeth
to
the
lady
of
the
lake
and
if
she
will
thou
mayest
take
it
but
if
she
will
not
it
will
not
be
in
thy
power
to
take
it
so
sir
arthur
and
merlin
alighted
from
their
horses
and
went
into
a
boat
and
when
they
came
to
the
sword
that
the
hand
held
sir
arthur
took
it
by
the
handle
and
took
it
to
him
and
the
arm
and
the
hand
went
under
the
water
then
they
returned
unto
the
land
and
rode
forth
and
sir
arthur
looked
on
the
sword
and
liked
it
right
well
so
they
rode
unto
caerleon
whereof
his
knights
were
passing
glad
and
when
they
heard
of
his
adventures
they
marvelled
that
he
would
jeopard
his
person
so
alone
but
all
men
of
worship
said
it
was
a
fine
thing
to
be
under
such
a
chieftain
as
would
put
his
person
in
adventure
as
other
poor
knights
did

king
arthur
held
his
court
in
merry
carlisle
when
a
damsel
came
before
him
and
craved
a
boon
it
was
for
vengeance
upon
a
caitiff
knight
who
had
made
her
lover
captive
and
despoiled
her
of
her
lands
king
arthur
commanded
to
bring
him
his
sword
excalibar
and
to
saddle
his
steed
and
rode
forth
without
delay
to
right
the
lady
wrong
ere
long
he
reached
the
castle
of
the
grim
baron
and
challenged
him
to
the
conflict
but
the
castle
stood
on
magic
ground
and
the
spell
was
such
that
no
knight
could
tread
thereon
but
straight
his
courage
fell
and
his
strength
decayed
king
arthur
felt
the
charm
and
before
a
blow
was
struck
his
sturdy
limbs
lost
their
strength
and
his
head
grew
faint
he
was
fain
to
yield
himself
prisoner
to
the
churlish
knight
who
refused
to
release
him
except
upon
condition
that
he
should
return
at
the
end
of
a
year
and
bring
a
true
answer
to
the
question
what
thing
is
it
which
women
most
desire
or
in
default
thereof
surrender
himself
and
his
lands
king
arthur
accepted
the
terms
and
gave
his
oath
to
return
at
the
time
appointed
during
the
year
the
king
rode
east
and
he
rode
west
and
inquired
of
all
whom
he
met
what
thing
it
is
which
all
women
most
desire
some
told
him
riches
some
pomp
and
state
some
mirth
some
flattery
and
some
a
gallant
knight
but
in
the
diversity
of
answers
he
could
find
no
sure
dependence
the
year
was
spent
when
one
day
as
he
rode
thoughtfully
through
a
forest
he
saw
sitting
beneath
a
tree
a
lady
of
such
hideous
aspect
that
he
turned
away
his
eyes
and
when
she
greeted
him
in
seemly
sort
made
no
answer
what
wight
art
thou
the
lady
said
that
will
not
speak
to
me
it
may
chance
that
i
may
resolve
thy
doubts
though
i
be
not
fair
of
aspect
if
thou
wilt
do
so
said
king
arthur
choose
what
reward
thou
wilt
thou
grim
lady
and
it
shall
be
given
thee
swear
me
this
upon
thy
faith
she
said
and
arthur
swore
it
then
the
lady
told
him
the
secret
and
demanded
her
reward
which
was
that
the
king
should
find
some
fair
and
courtly
knight
to
be
her
husband
king
arthur
hastened
to
the
grim
baron
castle
and
told
him
one
by
one
all
the
answers
which
he
had
received
from
his
various
advisers
except
the
last
and
not
one
was
admitted
as
the
true
one
now
yield
thee
arthur
the
giant
said
for
thou
hast
not
paid
thy
ransom
and
thou
and
thy
lands
are
forfeited
to
me
then
king
arthur
said
yet
hold
thy
hand
thou
proud
baron
i
pray
thee
hold
thy
hand
and
give
me
leave
to
speak
once
more
in
rescue
of
my
land
this
morn
as
i
came
over
a
moor
i
saw
a
lady
set
between
an
oak
and
a
green
holly
all
clad
in
red
scarlett
she
says
all
women
would
have
their
will
this
is
their
chief
desire
now
yield
as
thou
art
a
baron
true
that
i
have
paid
my
hire
it
was
my
sister
that
told
thee
this
the
churlish
baron
exclaimed
vengeance
light
on
her
i
will
some
time
or
other
do
her
as
ill
a
turn
king
arthur
rode
homeward
but
not
light
of
heart
for
he
remembered
the
promise
he
was
under
to
the
loathly
lady
to
give
her
one
of
his
young
and
gallant
knights
for
a
husband
he
told
his
grief
to
sir
gawain
his
nephew
and
he
replied
be
not
sad
my
lord
for
i
will
marry
the
loathly
lady
king
arthur
replied
now
nay
now
nay
good
sir
gawaine
my
sister
son
ye
be
the
loathly
lady
all
too
grim
and
all
too
foule
for
thee
but
gawain
persisted
and
the
king
at
last
with
sorrow
of
heart
consented
that
gawain
should
be
his
ransom
so
one
day
the
king
and
his
knights
rode
to
the
forest
met
the
loathly
lady
and
brought
her
to
the
court
sir
gawain
stood
the
scoffs
and
jeers
of
his
companions
as
he
best
might
and
the
marriage
was
solemnized
but
not
with
the
usual
festivities

when
night
came
and
they
were
alone
together
sir
gawain
could
not
conceal
his
aversion
and
the
lady
asked
him
why
he
sighed
so
heavily
and
turned
away
his
face
he
candidly
confessed
it
was
on
account
of
three
things
her
age
her
ugliness
and
her
low
degree
the
lady
not
at
all
offended
replied
with
excellent
arguments
to
all
his
objections
she
showed
him
that
with
age
is
discretion
with
ugliness
security
from
rivals
and
that
all
true
gentility
depends
not
upon
the
accident
of
birth
but
upon
the
character
of
the
individual
sir
gawain
made
no
reply
but
turning
his
eyes
on
his
bride
what
was
his
amazement
to
perceive
that
she
wore
no
longer
the
unseemly
aspect
that
had
so
distressed
him
she
then
told
him
that
the
form
she
had
worn
was
not
her
true
form
but
a
disguise
imposed
upon
her
by
a
wicked
enchanter
and
that
she
was
condemned
to
wear
it
until
two
things
should
happen
one
that
she
should
obtain
some
young
and
gallant
knight
to
be
her
husband
this
having
been
done
of
the
charm
was
removed
she
was
now
at
liberty
to
wear
her
true
form
for
half
the
time
and
she
bade
him
choose
whether
he
would
have
her
fair
by
day
and
ugly
by
night
or
the
reverse
sir
gawain
would
fain
have
had
her
look
her
best
by
night
when
he
alone
would
see
her
and
show
her
repulsive
visage
if
at
all
to
others
but
she
reminded
him
how
much
more
pleasant
it
would
be
to
her
to
wear
her
best
looks
in
the
throng
of
knights
and
ladies
by
day
sir
gawain
yielded
and
gave
up
his
will
to
hers
this
alone
was
wanting
to
dissolve
the
charm
the
lovely
lady
now
with
joy
assured
him
that
she
should
change
no
more
but
as
she
now
was
so
would
she
remain
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
sweet
blushes
stayned
her
cheek
her
eyen
were
black
as
sloe
the
ripening
cherrye
swelled
her
lippe
and
all
her
neck
was
snow
sir
gawain
kist
that
ladye
faire
lying
upon
the
sheete
and
swore
as
he
was
a
true
knight
the
spice
was
never
so
swete
the
dissolution
of
the
charm
which
had
held
the
lady
also
released
her
brother
the
grim
baron
for
he
too
had
been
implicated
in
it
he
ceased
to
be
a
churlish
oppressor
and
became
a
gallant
and
generous
knight
as
any
at
arthur
court
chapter

caradoc
briefbras
or
caradoc
with
the
shrunken
arm
caradoc
was
the
son
of
ysenne
the
beautiful
niece
of
arthur
he
was
ignorant
who
his
father
was
till
it
was
discovered
in
the
following
manner
when
the
youth
was
of
proper
years
to
receive
the
honors
of
knighthood
king
arthur
held
a
grand
court
for
the
purpose
of
knighting
him
on
this
occasion
a
strange
knight
presented
himself
and
challenged
the
knights
of
arthur
court
to
exchange
blow
for
blow
with
him
his
proposal
was
this
to
lay
his
neck
on
a
block
for
any
knight
to
strike
on
condition
that
if
he
survived
the
blow
the
knight
should
submit
in
turn
to
the
same
experiment
sir
kay
who
was
usually
ready
to
accept
all
challenges
pronounced
this
wholly
unreasonable
and
declared
that
he
would
not
accept
it
for
all
the
wealth
in
the
world
and
when
the
knight
offered
his
sword
with
which
the
operation
was
to
be
performed
no
person
ventured
to
accept
it
till
caradoc
growing
angry
at
the
disgrace
which
was
thus
incurred
by
the
round
table
threw
aside
his
mantle
and
took
it
do
you
do
this
as
one
of
the
best
knights
said
the
stranger
no
he
replied
but
as
one
of
the
most
foolish
the
stranger
lays
his
head
upon
the
block
receives
a
blow
which
sends
it
rolling
from
his
shoulders
walks
after
it
picks
it
up
replaces
it
with
great
success
and
says
he
will
return
when
the
court
shall
be
assembled
next
year
and
claim
his
turn
when
the
anniversary
arrived
both
parties
were
punctual
to
their
engagement
great
entreaties
were
used
by
the
king
and
queen
and
the
whole
court
in
behalf
of
caradoc
but
the
stranger
was
inflexible
the
young
knight
laid
his
head
upon
the
block
and
more
than
once
desired
him
to
make
an
end
of
the
business
and
not
keep
him
longer
in
so
disagreeable
a
state
of
expectation
at
last
the
stranger
strikes
him
gently
with
the
side
of
the
sword
bids
him
rise
and
reveals
to
him
the
fact
that
he
is
his
father
the
enchanter
eliaures
and
that
he
gladly
owns
him
for
a
son
having
proved
his
courage
and
fidelity
to
his
word
but
the
favor
of
enchanters
is
and
uncertain
eliaures
fell
under
the
influence
of
a
wicked
woman
who
to
satisfy
her
pique
against
caradoc
persuaded
the
enchanter
to
fasten
on
his
arm
a
serpent
which
remained
there
sucking
at
his
flesh
and
blood
no
human
skill
sufficing
either
to
remove
the
reptile
or
alleviate
the
torments
which
caradoc
endured
caradoc
was
betrothed
to
guimier
sister
to
his
bosom
friend
cador
and
daughter
to
the
king
of
cornwall
as
soon
as
they
were
informed
of
his
deplorable
condition
they
set
out
for
nantes
where
caradoc
castle
was
that
guimier
might
attend
upon
him
when
caradoc
heard
of
their
coming
his
first
emotion
was
that
of
joy
and
love
but
soon
he
began
to
fear
that
the
sight
of
his
emaciated
form
and
of
his
sufferings
would
disgust
guimier
and
this
apprehension
became
so
strong
that
he
departed
secretly
from
nantes
and
hid
himself
in
a
hermitage
he
was
sought
far
and
near
by
the
knights
of
arthur
court
and
cador
made
a
vow
never
to
desist
from
the
quest
till
he
should
have
found
him
after
long
wandering
cador
discovered
his
friend
in
the
hermitage
reduced
almost
to
a
skeleton
and
apparently
near
his
death
all
other
means
of
relief
having
already
been
tried
in
vain
cador
at
last
prevailed
on
the
enchanter
eliaures
to
disclose
the
only
method
which
could
avail
for
his
rescue
a
maiden
must
be
found
his
equal
in
birth
and
beauty
and
loving
him
better
than
herself
so
that
she
would
expose
herself
to
the
same
torment
to
deliver
him
two
vessels
were
then
to
be
provided
the
one
filled
with
sour
wine
and
the
other
with
milk
caradoc
must
enter
the
first
so
that
the
wine
should
reach
his
neck
and
the
maiden
must
get
into
the
other
and
exposing
her
bosom
upon
the
edge
of
the
vessel
invite
the
serpent
to
forsake
the
withered
flesh
of
his
victim
for
this
fresh
and
inviting
food
the
vessels
were
to
be
placed
three
feet
apart
and
as
the
serpent
crossed
from
one
to
the
other
a
knight
was
to
cut
him
in
two
if
he
failed
in
his
blow
caradoc
would
indeed
be
delivered
but
it
would
be
only
to
see
his
fair
champion
suffering
the
same
cruel
and
hopeless
torment
the
sequel
may
be
easily
foreseen
guimier
willingly
exposed
herself
to
the
perilous
adventure
and
cador
with
a
lucky
blow
killed
the
serpent
the
arm
in
which
caradoc
had
suffered
so
long
recovered
its
strength
but
not
its
shape
in
consequence
of
which
he
was
called
caradoc
briefbras
caradoc
of
the
shrunken

caradoc
and
guimier
are
the
hero
and
heroine
of
the
ballad
of
the

and
the
mantle
which
follows
the
boy
and
the
mantle
in
carlisle
dwelt
king
arthur
a
prince
of
passing
might
and
there
maintained
his
table
round
beset
with
many
a
knight
and
there
he
kept
his
christmas
with
mirth
and
princely
cheer
when
lo
a
strange
and
cunning
boy
before
him
did
appear
a
kirtle
and
a
mantle
this
boy
had
him
upon
with
brooches
rings
and
ouches
full
daintily
bedone
he
had
a
sash
of
silk
about
his
middle
meet
and
thus
with
seemly
curtesie
he
did
king
arthur
greet
speed
thee
brave
king
arthur
thus
feasting
in
thy
bower
and
guenever
thy
goodly
queen
that
fair
and
peerless

i
wish
you
all
take
heed
lest
what
ye
deem
a
blooming
rose
should
prove
a
cankered
weed
then
straightway
from
his
bosom
a
little
wand
he
drew
and
with
it
eke
a
mantle
of
wondrous
shape
and
hue
have
thou
here
king

have
this
here
of

and
give
unto
thy

queen
all
shapen
as
you

hath
been
to
blame
then
every

in

sly
glanced
at
his
dame
and
first
came
lady
guenever
the
mantle
she
must
try
this
dame
she
was
and
of
a
roving
eye
when
she
had
taken
the
mantle
and
all
with
it
was
clad
from
top
to
toe
it
shivered
down
as
though
with
shears
beshred

storming
like
a
fury
to
her

flung
away
she
cursed
the
rascal

that
had
the

wrought
and
doubly
cursed
the

on
and
boldly
to
the
little
boy

when
she
had
taken
the
mantle
with
purpose
for
to
wear
it
shrunk
up
to
her
shoulder
and
left
her
back
all
bare
then
every
merry
knight
that
was
in
arthur
court
gibed
and
laughed
and
flouted
to
see
that
pleasant
sport
down
she
threw
the
mantle
no
longer
bold
or
gay
but
with
a
face
all
pale
and
wan
to
her
chamber
slunk
away
then
forth
came
an
old
knight
a
pattering
his
creed
and
proffered
to
the
little
boy
five
nobles

lady
seemed
with
step
demure
and
slow
and
gravely
to
the
mantle
with
mincing
face
doth
go
when
she
the
same
had
taken
that
was
so
fine
and
thin
it
shrivelled
all
about
her
and
showed
her
dainty
skin
ah
little
did
her
mincing
or
his
long
prayers
bestead
she
had
no
more
hung
on
her
than
a
tassel
and
a
thread
down
she
threw
the
mantle
with
terror
and
dismay
and
with
a
face
of
scarlet
to
her
chamber
hied
away
sir
cradock
called
his
lady
and
bade
her
to
come
near

the

gently
blushing
with
modest
grace
came
on
and
now
to
try
the
wondrous
charm
courageously

gone
when
she
had
the
mantle
and
put
it
on
her
back
about
the
hem
it
seemed
to
wrinkle
and
to
crack
still
she
cried
mantle
and
shame

not
for

freely

or

i
have

i
kissed
sir
cradock
beneath

once
i
kissed
sir
cradock

before
he
married
me
when
she
had
thus
her
shriven
and
her
worst

told
the
mantle
soon
became
her
right
comely
as
it
should
most
rich
and
fair
of
color
like
gold
it
glittering
shone
and
much
the
knights
in
arthur
court
admired
her
every
one
footnote
fond
of
novelty
the
ballad
goes
on
to
tell
of
two
more
trials
of
a
similar
kind
made
by
means
of
a
boar
head
and
a
drinking
horn
in
both
of
which
the
result
was
equally
favorable
with
the
first
to
sir
cradock
and
his
lady
it
then
concludes
as

thus
boar

faithful
ally

attacked
by
his
enemy
claudas
and
after
a
long
war
saw
himself
reduced
to
the
possession
of
a
single
fortress
where
he
was
besieged
by
his
enemy
in
this
extremity
he
determined
to
solicit
the
assistance
of
arthur
and
escaped
in
a
dark
night
with
his
wife
helen
and
his
infant
son
launcelot
leaving
his
castle
in
the
hands
of
his
seneschal
who
immediately
surrendered
the
place
to
claudas
the
flames
of
his
burning
citadel
reached
the
eyes
of
the
unfortunate
monarch
during
his
flight
and
he
expired
with
grief
the
wretched
helen
leaving
her
child
on
the
brink
of
a
lake
flew
to
receive
the
last
sighs
of
her
husband
and
on
returning
perceived
the
little
launcelot
in
the
arms
of
a
nymph
who
on
the
approach
of
the
queen
threw
herself
into
the
lake
with
the
child
this
nymph
was
viviane
mistress
of
the
enchanter
merlin
better
known
by
the
name
of
the
lady
of
the
lake
launcelot
received
his
appellation
from
having
been
educated
at
the
court
of
this
enchantress
whose
palace
was
situated
in
the
midst
not
of
a
real
but
like
the
appearance
which
deceives
the
african
traveller
of
an
imaginary
lake
whose
deluding
resemblance
served
as
a
barrier
to
her
residence
here
she
dwelt
not
alone
but
in
the
midst
of
a
numerous
retinue
and
a
splendid
court
of
knights
and
damsels
the
queen
after
her
double
loss
retired
to
a
convent
where
she
was
joined
by
the
widow
of
bohort
for
this
good
king
had
died
of
grief
on
hearing
of
the
death
of
his
brother
ban
his
two
sons
lionel
and
bohort
were
rescued
by
a
faithful
knight
and
arrived
in
the
shape
of
greyhounds
at
the
palace
of
the
lake
where
having
resumed
their
natural
form
they
were
educated
along
with
their
cousin
launcelot
the
fairy
when
her
pupil
had
attained
the
age
of
eighteen
conveyed
him
to
the
court
of
arthur
for
the
purpose
of
demanding
his
admission
to
the
honor
of
knighthood
and
at
the
first
appearance
of
the
youthful
candidate
the
graces
of
his
person
which
were
not
inferior
to
his
courage
and
skill
in
arms
made
an
instantaneous
and
indelible
impression
on
the
heart
of
guenever
while
her
charms
inspired
him
with
an
equally
ardent
and
constant
passion
the
mutual
attachment
of
these
lovers
exerted
from
that
time
forth
an
influence
over
the
whole
history
of
arthur
for
the
sake
of
guenever
launcelot
achieved
the
conquest
of
northumberland
defeated
gallehaut
king
of
the
marches
who
afterwards
became
his
most
faithful
friend
and
ally
exposed
himself
in
numberless
encounters
and
brought
hosts
of
prisoners
to
the
feet
of
his
sovereign
sir
launcelot
after
king
arthur
was
come
from
rome
into
england
all
the
knights
of
the
table
round
resorted
unto
him
and
made
him
many
justs
and
tournaments
and
in
especial
sir
launcelot
of
the
lake
in
all
tournaments
and
justs
and
deeds
of
arms
both
for
life
and
death
passed
all
other
knights
and
was
never
overcome
except
it
were
by
treason
or
enchantment
and
he
increased
marvellously
in
worship
wherefore
queen
guenever
had
him
in
great
favor
above
all
other
knights
and
for
certain
he
loved
the
queen
again
above
all
other
ladies
and
for
her
he
did
many
deeds
of
arms
and
saved
her
from
peril
through
his
noble
chivalry
thus
sir
launcelot
rested
him
long
with
play
and
game
and
then
he
thought
to
prove
himself
in
strange
adventures
so
he
bade
his
nephew
sir
lionel
to
make
him
ready
for
we
two
will
seek
adventures
so
they
mounted
on
their
horses
armed
at
all
sights
and
rode
into
a
forest
and
so
into
a
deep
plain
and
the
weather
was
hot
about
noon
and
sir
launcelot
had
great
desire
to
sleep
then
sir
lionel
espied
a
great
that
stood
by
a
hedge
and
he
said
brother
yonder
is
a
fair
shadow
there
may
we
rest
us
and
our
horses
it
is
well
said
replied
sir
launcelot
so
they
there
alighted
and
sir
launcelot
laid
him
down
and
his
helm
under
his
head
and
soon
was
asleep
passing
fast
and
sir
lionel
waked
while
he
slept
and
presently
there
came
three
knights
riding
as
fast
as
ever
they
might
ride
and
there
followed
them
but
one
knight
and
sir
lionel
thought
he
never
saw
so
great
a
knight
before
so
within
a
while
this
great
knight
overtook
one
of
those
knights
and
smote
him
so
that
he
fell
to
the
earth
then
he
rode
to
the
second
knight
and
smote
him
and
so
he
did
to
the
third
knight
then
he
alighted
down
and
bound
all
the
three
knights
fast
with
their
own
bridles
when
sir
lionel
saw
him
do
thus
he
thought
to
assay
him
and
made
him
ready
silently
not
to
awake
sir
launcelot
and
rode
after
the
strong
knight
and
bade
him
turn
and
the
other
smote
sir
lionel
so
hard
that
horse
and
man
fell
to
the
earth
and
then
he
alighted
down
and
bound
sir
lionel
and
threw
him
across
his
own
horse
and
so
he
served
them
all
four
and
rode
with
them
away
to
his
own
castle
and
when
he
came
there
he
put
them
in
a
deep
prison
in
which
were
many
more
knights
in
great
distress
now
while
sir
launcelot
lay
under
the
sleeping
there
came
by
him
four
queens
of
great
estate
and
that
the
heat
should
not
grieve
them
there
rode
four
knights
about
them
and
bare
a
cloth
of
green
silk
on
four
spears
betwixt
them
and
the
sun
and
the
queens
rode
on
four
white
mules
thus
as
they
rode
they
heard
by
them
a
great
horse
grimly
neigh
then
they
were
aware
of
a
sleeping
knight
that
lay
all
armed
under
an
and
as
the
queens
looked
on
his
face
they
knew
it
was
sir
launcelot
then
they
began
to
strive
for
that
knight
and
each
one
said
she
would
have
him
for
her
love
we
will
not
strive
said
morgane
le
fay
that
was
king
sister
for
i
will
put
an
enchantment
upon
him
that
he
shall
not
wake
for
six
hours
and
we
will
take
him
away
to
my
castle
and
then
when
he
is
surely
within
my
hold
i
will
take
the
enchantment
from
him
and
then
let
him
choose
which
of
us
he
will
have
for
his
love
so
the
enchantment
was
cast
upon
sir
launcelot
and
then
they
laid
him
upon
his
shield
and
bare
him
so
on
horseback
between
two
knights
and
brought
him
unto
the
castle
and
laid
him
in
a
chamber
and
at
night
they
sent
him
his
supper
and
on
the
morning
came
early
those
four
queens
richly
dight
and
bade
him
good
morning
and
he
them
again
sir
knight
they
said
thou
must
understand
thou
art
our
prisoner
and
we
know
thee
well
that
thou
art
sir
launcelot
of
the
lake
king
ban
son
and
that
thou
art
the
noblest
knight
living
and
we
know
well
that
there
can
no
lady
have
thy
love
but
one
and
that
is
queen
guenever
and
now
thou
shalt
lose
her
for
ever
and
she
thee
and
therefore
it
behooveth
thee
now
to
choose
one
of
us
i
am
the
queen
morgane
le
fay
and
here
is
the
queen
of
north
wales
and
the
queen
of
eastland
and
the
queen
of
the
isles
now
choose
one
of
us
which
thou
wilt
have
for
if
thou
choose
not
in
this
prison
thou
shalt
die
this
is
a
hard
case
said
sir
launcelot
that
either
i
must
die
or
else
choose
one
of
you
yet
had
i
liever
to
die
in
this
prison
with
worship
than
to
have
one
of
you
for
my
paramour
for
ye
be
false
enchantresses
well
said
the
queens
is
this
your
answer
that
ye
will
refuse
us
yea
on
my
life
it
is
said
sir
launcelot
then
they
departed
making
great
sorrow
then
at
noon
came
a
damsel
unto
him
with
his
dinner
and
asked
him
what
cheer
truly
fair
damsel
said
sir
launcelot
never
so
sir
said
she
if
you
will
be
ruled
by
me
i
will
help
you
out
of
this
distress
if
ye
will
promise
me
to
help
my
father
on
tuesday
next
who
hath
made
a
tournament
betwixt
him
and
the
king
of
north
wales
for
last
tuesday
my
father
lost
the
field
fair
maiden
said
sir
launcelot
tell
me
what
is
your
father
name
and
then
will
i
give
you
an
answer
sir
knight
she
said
my
father

bagdemagus
i

well
said
sir
launcelot
for
a
noble
king
and
a
good
knight
and
by
the
faith
of
my
body
i
will
be
ready
to
do
your
father
and
you
service
at
that
day
so
she
departed
and
came
on
the
next
morning
early
and
found
him
ready
and
brought
him
out
of
twelve
locks
and
brought
him
to
his
own
horse
and
lightly
he
saddled
him
and
so
rode
forth
and
on
the
tuesday
next
he
came
to
a
little
wood
where
the
tournament
should
be
and
there
were
scaffolds
and
holds
that
lords
and
ladies
might
look
on
and
give
the
prize
then
came
into
the
field
the
king
of
north
wales
with
eightscore
helms
and
king
badgemagus
came
with
fourscore
helms
and
then
they
couched
their
spears
and
came
together
with
a
great
dash
and
there
were
overthrown
at
the
first
encounter
twelve
of
king
party
and
six
of
the
king
of
north
wales
party
and
king
bagdemagus
party
had
the
worse
with
that
came
sir
launcelot
of
the
lake
and
thrust
in
with
his
spear
in
the
thickest
of
the
press
and
he
smote
down
five
knights
ere
he
held
his
hand
and
he
smote
down
the
king
of
north
wales
and
he
brake
his
thigh
in
that
fall
and
then
the
knights
of
the
king
of
north
wales
would
just
no
more
and
so
the
gree
was
given
to
king
bagdemagus
and
sir
launcelot
rode
forth
with
king
bagdemagus
unto
his
castle
and
there
he
had
passing
good
cheer
both
with
the
king
and
with
his
daughter
and
on
the
morn
he
took
his
leave
and
told
the
king
he
would
go
and
seek
his
brother
sir
lionel
that
went
from
him
when
he
slept
so
he
departed
and
by
adventure
he
came
to
the
same
forest
where
he
was
taken
sleeping
and
in
the
highway
he
met
a
damsel
riding
on
a
white
palfrey
and
they
saluted
each
other
fair
damsel
said
sir
launcelot
know
ye
in
this
country
any
adventures
sir
knight
said
the
damsel
here
are
adventures
near
at
hand
if
thou
durst
pursue
them
why
should
i
not
prove
adventures
said
sir
launcelot
since
for
that
cause
came
i
hither
sir
said
she
hereby
dwelleth
a
knight
that
will
not
be
overmatched
for
any
man
i
know
except
thou
overmatch
him
his
name
is
sir
turquine
and
as
i
understand
he
is
a
deadly
enemy
of
king
arthur
and
he
has
in
his
prison
good
knights
of
court
threescore
and
more
that
he
hath
won
with
his
own
hands
damsel
said
launcelot
i
pray
you
bring
me
unto
this
knight
so
she
told
him
hereby
within
this
mile
is
his
castle
and
by
it
on
the
left
hand
is
a
ford
for
horses
to
drink
of
and
over
that
ford
there
groweth
a
fair
tree
and
on
that
tree
hang
many
shields
that
good
knights
wielded
aforetime
that
are
now
prisoners
and
on
the
tree
hangeth
a
basin
of
copper
and
latten
and
if
thou
strike
upon
that
basin
thou
shalt
hear
tidings
and
sir
launcelot
departed
and
rode
as
the
damsel
had
shown
him
and
shortly
he
came
to
the
ford
and
the
tree
where
hung
the
shields
and
the
basin
and
among
the
shields
he
saw
sir
lionel
and
sir
hector
shields
besides
many
others
of
knights
that
he
knew
then
sir
launcelot
struck
on
the
basin
with
the
butt
of
his
spear
and
long
he
did
so
but
he
saw
no
man
and
at
length
he
was
ware
of
a
great
knight
that
drove
a
horse
before
him
and
across
the
horse
there
lay
an
armed
knight
bounden
and
as
they
came
near
sir
launcelot
thought
he
should
know
the
captive
knight
then
sir
launcelot
saw
that
it
was
sir
gaheris
sir
gawain
brother
a
knight
of
the
table
round
now
fair
knight
said
sir
launcelot
put
that
wounded
knight
off
the
horse
and
let
him
rest
awhile
and
let
us
two
prove
our
strength
for
as
it
is
told
me
thou
hast
done
great
despite
and
shame
unto
knights
of
the
round
table
therefore
now
defend
thee
if
thou
be
of
the
table
round
said
sir
turquine
i
defy
thee
and
all
thy
fellowship
that
is
overmuch
said
said
sir
launcelot
then
they
put
their
spears
in
the
rests
and
came
together
with
their
horses
as
fast
as
they
might
run
and
each
smote
the
other
in
the
middle
of
their
shields
so
that
their
horses
fell
under
them
and
the
knights
were
both
staggered
and
as
soon
as
they
could
clear
their
horses
they
drew
out
their
swords
and
came
together
eagerly
and
each
gave
the
other
many
strong
strokes
for
neither
shield
nor
harness
might
withstand
their
strokes
so
within
a
while
both
had
grimly
wounds
and
bled
grievously
then
at
the
last
they
were
breathless
both
and
stood
leaning
upon
their
swords
now
fellow
said
sir
turquine
thou
art
the
stoutest
man
that
ever
i
met
with
and
best
breathed
and
so
be
it
thou
be
not
the
knight
that
i
hate
above
all
other
knights
the
knight
that
slew
my
brother
sir
carados
i
will
gladly
accord
with
thee
and
for
thy
love
i
will
deliver
all
the
prisoners
that
i
have
what
knight
is
he
that
thou
hatest
so
above
others
truly
said
sir
turquine
his
name
is
sir
launcelot
of
the
lake
i
am
sir
launcelot
of
the
lake
king
ban
son
of
benwick
and
very
knight
of
the
table
round
and
now
i
defy
thee
do
thy
best
ah
said
sir
turquine
launcelot
thou
art
to
me
the
most
welcome
that
ever
was
knight
for
we
shall
never
part
till
the
one
of
us
be
dead
and
then
they
hurtled
together
like
two
wild
bulls
rashing
and
lashing
with
their
swords
and
shields
so
that
sometimes
they
fell
as
it
were
headlong
thus
they
fought
two
hours
and
more
till
the
ground
where
they
fought
was
all
bepurpled
with
blood
then
at
the
last
sir
turquine
waxed
sore
faint
and
gave
somewhat
aback
and
bare
his
shield
full
low
for
weariness
that
spied
sir
launcelot
and
leapt
then
upon
him
fiercely
as
a
lion
and
took
him
by
the
beaver
of
his
helmet
and
drew
him
down
on
his
knees
and
he
raised
off
his
helm
and
smote
his
neck
in
sunder
and
sir
gaheris
when
he
saw
sir
turquine
slain
said
fair
lord
i
pray
you
tell
me
your
name
for
this
day
i
say
ye
are
the
best
knight
in
the
world
for
ye
have
slain
this
day
in
my
sight
the
mightiest
man
and
the
best
knight
except
you
that
ever
i
saw
sir
my
name
is
sir
launcelot
du
lac
that
ought
to
help
you
of
right
for
king
arthur
sake
and
in
especial
for
sir
sake
your
own
dear
brother
now
i
pray
you
that
ye
go
into
yonder
castle
and
set
free
all
the
prisoners
ye
find
there
for
i
am
sure
ye
shall
find
there
many
knights
of
the
table
round
and
especially
my
brother
sir
lionel
i
pray
you
greet
them
all
from
me
and
tell
them
i
bid
them
take
there
such
stuff
as
they
find
and
tell
my
brother
to
go
unto
the
court
and
abide
me
there
for
by
the
feast
of
pentecost
i
think
to
be
there
but
at
this
time
i
may
not
stop
for
i
have
adventures
on
hand
so
he
departed
and
sir
gaheris
rode
into
the
castle
and
took
the
keys
from
the
porter
and
hastily
opened
the
prison
door
and
let
out
all
the
prisoners
there
was
sir
kay
sir
brandeles
and
sir
galynde
sir
bryan
and
sir
alyduke
sir
hector
de
marys
and
sir
lionel
and
many
more
and
when
they
saw
sir
gaheris
they
all
thanked
him
for
they
thought
because
he
was
wounded
that
he
had
slain
sir
turquine
not
so
said
sir
gaheris
it
was
sir
launcelot
that
slew
him
right
worshipfully
i
saw
it
with
mine
eyes
sir
launcelot
rode
till
at
nightfall
he
came
to
a
fair
castle
and
therein
he
found
an
old
gentlewoman
who
lodged
him
with
will
and
there
he
had
good
cheer
for
him
and
his
horse
and
when
time
was
his
host
brought
him
to
a
fair
chamber
over
the
gate
to
his
bed
then
sir
launcelot
unarmed
him
and
set
his
harness
by
him
and
went
to
bed
and
anon
he
fell
asleep
and
soon
after
there
came
one
on
horseback
and
knocked
at
the
gate
in
great
haste
and
when
sir
launcelot
heard
this
he
arose
and
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
by
the
moonlight
three
knights
riding
after
that
one
man
and
all
three
lashed
on
him
with
their
swords
and
that
one
knight
turned
on
them
knightly
again
and
defended
himself
truly
said
sir
launcelot
yonder
one
knight
will
i
help
for
it
is
shame
to
see
three
knights
on
one
then
he
took
his
harness
and
went
out
at
the
window
by
a
sheet
down
to
the
four
knights
and
he
said
aloud
turn
you
knights
unto
me
and
leave
your
fighting
with
that
knight
then
the
knights
left
sir
kay
for
it
was
he
they
were
upon
and
turned
unto
sir
launcelot
and
struck
many
great
strokes
at
sir
launcelot
and
assailed
him
on
every
side
then
sir
kay
addressed
him
to
help
sir
launcelot
but
he
said
nay
sir
i
will
none
of
your
help
let
me
alone
with
them
so
sir
kay
suffered
him
to
do
his
will
and
stood
one
side
and
within
six
strokes
sir
launcelot
had
stricken
them
down
then
they
all
cried
sir
knight
we
yield
us
unto
you
as
to
that
said
sir
launcelot
i
will
not
take
your
yielding
unto
me
if
so
be
ye
will
yield
you
unto
sir
kay
the
seneschal
i
will
save
your
lives
but
else
not
fair
knight
then
they
said
we
will
do
as
thou
commandest
us
then
shall
ye
said
sir
launcelot
on
whitsunday
next
go
unto
the
court
of
king
arthur
and
there
shall
ye
yield
you
unto
queen
guenever
and
say
that
sir
kay
sent
you
thither
to
be
her
prisoners
sir
they
said
it
shall
be
done
by
the
faith
of
our
bodies
and
then
they
swore
every
knight
upon
his
sword
and
so
sir
launcelot
suffered
them
to
depart
on
the
morn
sir
launcelot
rose
early
and
left
sir
kay
sleeping
and
sir
launcelot
took
sir
kay
armor
and
his
shield
and
armed
him
and
went
to
the
stable
and
took
his
horse
and
so
he
departed
then
soon
after
arose
sir
kay
and
missed
sir
launcelot
and
then
he
espied
that
he
had
taken
his
armor
and
his
horse
now
by
my
faith
i
know
well
said
sir
kay
that
he
will
grieve
some
of
king
arthur
knights
for
they
will
deem
that
it
is
i
and
will
be
bold
to
meet
him
but
by
cause
of
his
armor
i
am
sure
i
shall
ride
in
peace
then
sir
kay
thanked
his
host
and
departed
sir
launcelot
rode
in
a
deep
forest
and
there
he
saw
four
knights
under
an
oak
and
they
were
of
arthur
court
there
was
sir
sagramour
le
desirus
and
hector
de
marys
and
sir
gawain
and
sir
uwaine
as
they
spied
sir
launcelot
they
judged
by
his
arms
it
had
been
sir
kay
now
by
my
faith
said
sir
sagramour
i
will
prove
sir
kay
might
and
got
his
spear
in
his
hand
and
came
towards
sir
launcelot
therewith
sir
launcelot
couched
his
spear
against
him
and
smote
sir
sagramour
so
sore
that
horse
and
man
fell
both
to
the
earth
then
said
sir
hector
now
shall
ye
see
what
i
may
do
with
him
but
he
fared
worse
than
sir
sagramour
for
sir
launcelot
spear
went
through
his
shoulder
and
bare
him
from
his
horse
to
the
ground
by
my
faith
said
sir
uwaine
yonder
is
a
strong
knight
and
i
fear
he
hath
slain
sir
kay
and
taken
his
armor
and
therewith
sir
uwaine
took
his
spear
in
hand
and
rode
toward
sir
launcelot
and
sir
launcelot
met
him
on
the
plain
and
gave
him
such
a
buffet
that
he
was
staggered
and
wist
not
where
he
was
now
see
i
well
said
sir
gawain
that
i
must
encounter
with
that
knight
then
he
adjusted
his
shield
and
took
a
good
spear
in
his
hand
and
sir
launcelot
knew
him
well
then
they
let
run
their
horses
with
all
their
mights
and
each
knight
smote
the
other
in
the
middle
of
his
shield
but
sir
spear
broke
and
sir
launcelot
charged
so
sore
upon
him
that
his
horse
fell
over
backward
then
sir
launcelot
passed
by
smiling
with
himself
and
he
said
good
luck
be
with
him
that
made
this
spear
for
never
came
a
better
into
my
hand
then
the
four
knights
went
each
to
the
other
and
comforted
one
another
what
say
ye
to
this
adventure
said
sir
gawain
that
one
spear
hath
felled
us
all
four
i
dare
lay
my
head
it
is
sir
launcelot
said
sir
hector
i
know
it
by
his
riding
and
sir
launcelot
rode
through
many
strange
countries
till
by
fortune
he
came
to
a
fair
castle
and
as
he
passed
beyond
the
castle
he
thought
he
heard
two
bells
ring
and
then
he
perceived
how
a
falcon
came
flying
over
his
head
toward
a
high
elm
and
she
had
long
lunys
footnote
lunys
the
string
with
which
the
falcon
is
held
about
her
feet
and
she
flew
unto
the
elm
to
take
her
perch
and
the
lunys
got
entangled
in
the
bough
and
when
she
would
have
taken
her
flight
she
hung
by
the
legs
fast
and
sir
launcelot
saw
how
she
hung
and
beheld
the
fair
falcon
entangled
and
he
was
sorry
for
her
then
came
a
lady
out
of
the
castle
and
cried
aloud
o
launcelot
launcelot
as
thou
art
the
flower
of
all
knights
help
me
to
get
my
hawk
for
if
my
hawk
be
lost
my
lord
will
slay
me
he
is
so
hasty
what
is
your
lord
name
said
sir
launcelot
his
name
is
sir
phelot
a
knight
that
belongeth
to
the
king
of
north
wales
well
fair
lady
since
ye
know
my
name
and
require
me
of
knighthood
to
help
you
i
will
do
what
i
may
to
get
your
hawk
and
yet
in
truth
i
am
an
ill
climber
and
the
tree
is
passing
high
and
few
boughs
to
help
me
and
therewith
sir
launcelot
alighted
and
tied
his
horse
to
the
tree
and
prayed
the
lady
to
unarm
him
and
when
he
was
unarmed
he
put
off
his
jerkin
and
with
might
and
force
he
clomb
up
to
the
falcon
and
tied
the
lunys
to
a
rotten
bough
and
threw
the
hawk
down
with
it
and
the
lady
got
the
hawk
in
her
hand
then
suddenly
there
came
out
of
the
castle
her
husband
all
armed
and
with
his
naked
sword
in
his
hand
and
said
o
knight
launcelot
now
have
i
got
thee
as
i
would
and
stood
at
the
boll
of
the
tree
to
slay
him
ah
lady
said
sir
launcelot
why
have
ye
betrayed
me
she
hath
done
said
sir
phelot
but
as
i
commanded
her
and
therefore
there
is
none
other
way
but
thine
hour
is
come
and
thou
must
die
that
were
shame
unto
thee
said
sir
launcelot
thou
an
armed
knight
to
slay
a
naked
man
by
treason
thou
gettest
none
other
grace
said
sir
phelot
and
therefore
help
thyself
if
thou
canst
alas
said
sir
launcelot
that
ever
a
knight
should
die
weaponless
and
therewith
he
turned
his
eyes
upward
and
downward
and
over
his
head
he
saw
a
big
bough
leafless
and
he
brake
it
off
from
the
trunk
and
then
he
came
lower
and
watched
how
his
own
horse
stood
and
suddenly
he
leapt
on
the
further
side
of
his
horse
from
the
knight
then
sir
phelot
lashed
at
him
eagerly
meaning
to
have
slain
him
but
sir
launcelot
put
away
the
stroke
with
the
big
bough
and
smote
sir
phelot
therewith
on
the
side
of
the
head
so
that
he
fell
down
in
a
swoon
to
the
ground
then
sir
launcelot
took
his
sword
out
of
his
hand
and
struck
his
head
from
the
body
then
said
the
lady
alas
why
hast
thou
slain
my
husband
i
am
not
the
cause
said
sir
launcelot
for
with
falsehood
ye
would
have
slain
me
and
now
it
is
fallen
on
yourselves
thereupon
sir
launcelot
got
all
his
armor
and
put
it
upon
him
hastily
for
fear
of
more
resort
for
the
knight
castle
was
so
nigh
and
as
soon
as
he
might
he
took
his
horse
and
departed
and
thanked
god
he
had
escaped
that
adventure
and
two
days
before
the
feast
of
pentecost
sir
launcelot
came
home
and
the
king
and
all
the
court
were
passing
glad
of
his
coming
and
when
sir
gawain
sir
uwaine
sir
sagramour
and
sir
hector
de
marys
saw
sir
launcelot
in
sir
kay
armor
then
they
wist
well
it
was
he
that
smote
them
down
all
with
one
spear
then
there
was
laughing
and
merriment
among
them
and
from
time
to
time
came
all
the
knights
that
sir
turquine
had
prisoners
and
they
all
honored
and
worshipped
sir
launcelot
then
sir
gaheris
said
i
saw
all
the
battle
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
and
he
told
king
arthur
all
how
it
was
then
sir
kay
told
the
king
how
sir
launcelot
had
rescued
him
and
how
he
made
the
knights
yield
to
me
and
not
to
him
and
there
they
were
all
three
and
confirmed
it
all
and
by
my
faith
said
sir
kay
because
sir
launcelot
took
my
harness
and
left
me
his
i
rode
in
peace
and
no
man
would
have
to
do
with
me
and
so
at
that
time
sir
launcelot
had
the
greatest
name
of
any
knight
of
the
world
and
most
was
he
honored
of
high
and
low
chapter
ix
the
adventure
of
the
cart
it
befell
in
the
month
of
may
queen
guenever
called
to
her
knights
of
the
table
round
and
gave
them
warning
that
early
upon
the
morrow
she
would
ride
into
the
woods
and
fields
beside
westminster
and
i
warn
you
that
there
be
none
of
you
but
he
be
well
horsed
and
that
ye
all
be
clothed
in
green
either
silk
or
cloth
and
i
shall
bring
with
me
ten
ladies
and
every
knight
shall
have
a
lady
behind
him
and
every
knight
shall
have
a
squire
and
two
yeoman
and
all
well
horsed
for
thus
it
chanced
one
morn
when
all
the
court
but
with
plumes
that
mock
the
may
had
been
their
wont
guinevere
so
they
made
them
ready
and
these
were
the
names
of
the
knights
sir
kay
the
seneschal
sir
agrivaine
sir
brandiles
sir
sagramour
le
desirus
sir
dodynas
le
sauvage
sir
ozanna
sir
ladynas
sir
persant
of
inde
sir
ironside
and
sir
pelleas
and
these
ten
knights
made
them
ready
in
the
freshest
manner
to
ride
with
the
queen
so
upon
the
morn
they
took
their
horses
with
the
queen
and
rode
in
woods
and
meadows
as
it
pleased
them
in
great
joy
and
delight
now
there
was
a
knight
named
maleagans
son
to
king
brademagus
who
loved
queen
guenever
passing
well
and
so
had
he
done
long
and
many
years
now
this
knight
sir
maleagans
learned
the
queen
purpose
and
that
she
had
no
men
of
arms
with
her
but
the
ten
noble
knights
all
arrayed
in
green
for
maying
so
he
prepared
him
twenty
men
of
arms
and
a
hundred
archers
to
take
captive
the
queen
and
her
knights
in
the
merry
month
of
may
in
a
morn
at
break
of
day
with
a
troop
of
damsels
playing
the
queen
forsooth
went
forth
old
song
so
when
the
queen
had
mayed
and
all
were
bedecked
with
herbs
mosses
and
flowers
in
the
best
manner
and
freshest
right
then
came
out
of
a
wood
sir
maleagans
with
eightscore
men
well
harnessed
and
bade
the
queen
and
her
knights
yield
them
prisoners
traitor
knight
said
queen
guenever
what
wilt
thou
do
wilt
thou
shame
thyself
bethink
thee
how
thou
art
a
son
and
a
knight
of
the
table
round
and
how
thou
art
about
to
dishonor
all
knighthood
and
thyself
be
it
as
it
may
said
sir
maleagans
know
you
well
madam
i
have
loved
you
many
a
year
and
never
till
now
could
i
get
you
to
such
advantage
as
i
do
now
and
therefore
i
will
take
you
as
i
find
you
then
the
ten
knights
of
the
round
table
drew
their
swords
and
the
other
party
run
at
them
with
their
spears
and
the
ten
knights
manfully
abode
them
and
smote
away
their
spears
then
they
lashed
together
with
swords
till
several
were
smitten
to
the
earth
so
when
the
queen
saw
her
knights
thus
dolefully
oppressed
and
needs
must
be
slain
at
the
last
then
for
pity
and
sorrow
she
cried
sir
maleagans
slay
not
my
noble
knights
and
i
will
go
with
you
upon
this
covenant
that
they
be
led
with
me
wheresoever
thou
leadest
me
madame
said
maleagans
for
your
sake
they
shall
be
led
with
you
into
my
own
castle
if
that
ye
will
be
ruled
and
ride
with
me
then
sir
maleagans
charged
them
all
that
none
should
depart
from
the
queen
for
he
dreaded
lest
sir
launcelot
should
have
knowledge
of
what
had
been
done
then
the
queen
privily
called
unto
her
a
page
of
her
chamber
that
was
swiftly
horsed
to
whom
she
said
go
thou
when
thou
seest
thy
time
and
bear
this
ring
unto
sir
launcelot
and
pray
him
as
he
loveth
me
that
he
will
see
me
and
rescue
me
and
spare
not
thy
horse
said
the
queen
neither
for
water
nor
for
land
so
the
child
espied
his
time
and
lightly
he
took
his
horse
with
the
spurs
and
departed
as
fast
as
he
might
and
when
sir
maleagans
saw
him
so
flee
he
understood
that
it
was
by
the
queen
commandment
for
to
warn
sir
launcelot
then
they
that
were
best
horsed
chased
him
and
shot
at
him
but
the
child
went
from
them
all
then
sir
maleagans
said
to
the
queen
madam
ye
are
about
to
betray
me
but
i
shall
arrange
for
sir
launcelot
that
he
shall
not
come
lightly
at
you
then
he
rode
with
her
and
them
all
to
his
castle
in
all
the
haste
that
they
might
and
by
the
way
sir
maleagans
laid
in
ambush
the
best
archers
that
he
had
to
wait
for
sir
launcelot
and
the
child
came
to
westminster
and
found
sir
launcelot
and
told
his
message
and
delivered
him
the
queen
ring
alas
said
sir
launcelot
now
am
i
shamed
for
ever
unless
i
may
rescue
that
noble
lady
then
eagerly
he
asked
his
armor
and
put
it
on
him
and
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
as
fast
as
he
might
and
men
say
he
took
the
water
at
westminster
bridge
and
made
his
horse
swim
over
thames
unto
lambeth
then
within
a
while
he
came
to
a
wood
where
was
a
narrow
way
and
there
the
archers
were
laid
in
ambush
and
they
shot
at
him
and
smote
his
horse
so
that
he
fell
then
sir
launcelot
left
his
horse
and
went
on
foot
but
there
lay
so
many
ditches
and
hedges
betwixt
the
archers
and
him
that
he
might
not
meddle
with
them
alas
for
shame
said
sir
launcelot
that
ever
one
knight
should
betray
another
but
it
is
an
old
saw
a
good
man
is
never
in
danger
but
when
he
is
in
danger
of
a
coward
then
sir
launcelot
went
awhile
and
he
was
exceedingly
cumbered
by
his
armor
his
shield
and
his
spear
and
all
that
belonged
to
him
then
by
chance
there
came
by
him
a
cart
that
came
thither
to
fetch
wood
now
at
this
time
carts
were
little
used
except
for
carrying
offal
and
for
conveying
criminals
to
execution
but
sir
launcelot
took
no
thought
of
anything
but
the
necessity
of
haste
for
the
purpose
of
rescuing
the
queen
so
he
demanded
of
the
carter
that
he
should
take
him
in
and
convey
him
as
speedily
as
possible
for
a
liberal
reward
the
carter
consented
and
sir
launcelot
placed
himself
in
the
cart
and
only
lamented
that
with
much
jolting
he
made
but
little
progress
then
it
happened
sir
gawain
passed
by
and
seeing
an
armed
knight
travelling
in
that
unusual
way
he
drew
near
to
see
who
it
might
be
then
sir
launcelot
told
him
how
the
queen
had
been
carried
off
and
how
in
hastening
to
her
rescue
his
horse
had
been
disabled
and
he
had
been
compelled
to
avail
himself
of
the
cart
rather
than
give
up
his
enterprise
then
sir
gawain
said
surely
it
is
unworthy
of
a
knight
to
travel
in
such
sort
but
sir
launcelot
heeded
him
not
at
nightfall
they
arrived
at
a
castle
and
the
lady
thereof
came
out
at
the
head
of
her
damsels
to
welcome
sir
gawain
but
to
admit
his
companion
whom
she
supposed
to
be
a
criminal
or
at
least
a
prisoner
it
pleased
her
not
however
to
oblige
sir
gawain
she
consented
at
supper
sir
launcelot
came
near
being
consigned
to
the
kitchen
and
was
only
admitted
to
the
lady
table
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
sir
gawain
neither
would
the
damsels
prepare
a
bed
for
him
he
seized
the
first
he
found
unoccupied
and
was
left
undisturbed
next
morning
he
saw
from
the
turrets
of
the
castle
a
train
accompanying
a
lady
whom
he
imagined
to
be
the
queen
sir
gawain
thought
it
might
be
so
and
became
equally
eager
to
depart
the
lady
of
the
castle
supplied
sir
launcelot
with
a
horse
and
they
traversed
the
plain
at
full
speed
they
learned
from
some
travellers
whom
they
met
that
there
were
two
roads
which
led
to
the
castle
of
sir
maleagans
here
therefore
the
friends
separated
sir
launcelot
found
his
way
beset
with
obstacles
which
he
encountered
successfully
but
not
without
much
loss
of
time
as
evening
approached
he
was
met
by
a
young
and
sportive
damsel
who
gayly
proposed
to
him
a
supper
at
her
castle
the
knight
who
was
hungry
and
weary
accepted
the
offer
though
with
no
very
good
grace
he
followed
the
lady
to
her
castle
and
ate
voraciously
of
her
supper
but
was
quite
impenetrable
to
all
her
amorous
advances
suddenly
the
scene
changed
and
he
was
assailed
by
six
furious
ruffians
whom
he
dealt
with
so
vigorously
that
most
of
them
were
speedily
disabled
when
again
there
was
a
change
and
he
found
himself
alone
with
his
fair
hostess
who
informed
him
that
she
was
none
other
than
his
guardian
fairy
who
had
but
subjected
him
to
tests
of
his
courage
and
fidelity
the
next
day
the
fairy
brought
him
on
his
road
and
before
parting
gave
him
a
ring
which
she
told
him
would
by
its
changes
of
color
disclose
to
him
all
enchantments
and
enable
him
to
subdue
them
sir
launcelot
pursued
his
journey
without
being
much
incommoded
except
by
the
taunts
of
travellers
who
all
seemed
to
have
learned
by
some
means
his
disgraceful
drive
in
the
cart
one
more
insolent
than
the
rest
had
the
audacity
to
interrupt
him
during
dinner
and
even
to
risk
a
battle
in
support
of
his
pleasantry
launcelot
after
an
easy
victory
only
doomed
him
to
be
carted
in
his
turn
at
night
he
was
received
at
another
castle
with
great
apparent
hospitality
but
found
himself
in
the
morning
in
a
dungeon
and
loaded
with
chains
consulting
his
ring
and
finding
that
this
was
an
enchantment
he
burst
his
chains
seized
his
armor
in
spite
of
the
visionary
monsters
who
attempted
to
defend
it
broke
open
the
gates
of
the
tower
and
continued
his
journey
at
length
his
progress
was
checked
by
a
wide
and
rapid
torrent
which
could
only
be
passed
on
a
narrow
bridge
on
which
a
false
step
would
prove
his
destruction
launcelot
leading
his
horse
by
the
bridle
and
making
him
swim
by
his
side
passed
over
the
bridge
and
was
attacked
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
bank
by
a
lion
and
a
leopard
both
of
which
he
slew
and
then
exhausted
and
bleeding
seated
himself
on
the
grass
and
endeavored
to
bind
up
his
wounds
when
he
was
accosted
by
brademagus
the
father
of
maleagans
whose
castle
was
then
in
sight
and
at
no
great
distance
this
king
no
less
courteous
than
his
son
was
haughty
and
insolent
after
complimenting
sir
launcelot
on
the
valor
and
skill
he
had
displayed
in
the
perils
of
the
bridge
and
the
wild
beasts
offered
him
his
assistance
and
informed
him
that
the
queen
was
safe
in
his
castle
but
could
only
be
rescued
by
encountering
maleagans
launcelot
demanded
the
battle
for
the
next
day
and
accordingly
it
took
place
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
and
under
the
eyes
of
the
fair
captive
launcelot
was
enfeebled
by
his
wounds
and
fought
not
with
his
usual
spirit
and
the
contest
for
a
time
was
doubtful
till
guenever
exclaimed
ah
launcelot
my
knight
truly
have
i
been
told
that
thou
art
no
longer
worthy
of
me
these
words
instantly
revived
the
drooping
knight
he
resumed
at
once
his
usual
superiority
and
soon
laid
at
his
feet
his
haughty
adversary
he
was
on
the
point
of
sacrificing
him
to
his
resentment
when
guenever
moved
by
the
entreaties
of
brademagus
ordered
him
to
withhold
the
blow
and
he
obeyed
the
castle
and
its
prisoners
were
now
at
his
disposal
launcelot
hastened
to
the
apartment
of
the
queen
threw
himself
at
her
feet
and
was
about
to
kiss
her
hand
when
she
exclaimed
ah
launcelot
why
do
i
see
thee
again
yet
feel
thee
to
be
no
longer
worthy
of
me
after
having
been
disgracefully
drawn
about
the
country
in
a
she
had
not
time
to
finish
the
phrase
for
her
lover
suddenly
started
from
her
and
bitterly
lamenting
that
he
had
incurred
the
displeasure
of
his
sovereign
lady
rushed
out
of
the
castle
threw
his
sword
and
his
shield
to
the
right
and
left
ran
furiously
into
the
woods
and
disappeared
it
seems
that
the
story
of
the
abominable
cart
which
haunted
launcelot
at
every
step
had
reached
the
ears
of
sir
kay
who
had
told
it
to
the
queen
as
a
proof
that
her
knight
must
have
been
dishonored
but
guenever
had
full
leisure
to
repent
the
haste
with
which
she
had
given
credit
to
the
tale
three
days
elapsed
during
which
launcelot
wandered
without
knowing
where
he
went
till
at
last
he
began
to
reflect
that
his
mistress
had
doubtless
been
deceived
by
misrepresentation
and
that
it
was
his
duty
to
set
her
right
he
therefore
returned
compelled
maleagans
to
release
his
prisoners
and
taking
the
road
by
which
they
expected
the
arrival
of
sir
gawain
had
the
satisfaction
of
meeting
him
the
next
day
after
which
the
whole
company
proceeded
gayly
towards
camelot
chapter
x
the
lady
of
shalott
king
arthur
proclaimed
a
solemn
tournament
to
be
held
at
winchester
the
king
not
less
impatient
than
his
knights
for
this
festival
set
off
some
days
before
to
superintend
the
preparations
leaving
the
queen
with
her
court
at
camelot
sir
launcelot
under
pretence
of
indisposition
remained
behind
also
his
intention
was
to
attend
the
tournament
in
disguise
and
having
communicated
his
project
to
guenever
he
mounted
his
horse
set
off
without
any
attendant
and
counterfeiting
the
feebleness
of
age
took
the
most
unfrequented
road
to
winchester
and
passed
unnoticed
as
an
old
knight
who
was
going
to
be
a
spectator
of
the
sports
even
arthur
and
gawain
who
happened
to
behold
him
from
the
windows
of
a
castle
under
which
he
passed
were
the
dupes
of
his
disguise
but
an
accident
betrayed
him
his
horse
happened
to
stumble
and
the
hero
forgetting
for
a
moment
his
assumed
character
recovered
the
animal
with
a
strength
and
agility
so
peculiar
to
himself
that
they
instantly
recognized
the
inimitable
launcelot
they
suffered
him
however
to
proceed
on
his
journey
without
interruption
convinced
that
his
extraordinary
feats
of
arms
must
discover
him
at
the
approaching
festival
in
the
evening
launcelot
was
magnificently
entertained
as
a
stranger
knight
at
the
neighboring
castle
of
shalott
the
lord
of
this
castle
had
a
daughter
of
exquisite
beauty
and
two
sons
lately
received
into
the
order
of
knighthood
one
of
whom
was
at
that
time
ill
in
bed
and
thereby
prevented
from
attending
the
tournament
for
which
both
brothers
had
long
made
preparation
launcelot
offered
to
attend
the
other
if
he
were
permitted
to
borrow
the
armor
of
the
invalid
and
the
lord
of
shalott
without
knowing
the
name
of
his
guest
being
satisfied
from
his
appearance
that
his
son
could
not
have
a
better
assistant
in
arms
most
thankfully
accepted
the
offer
in
the
meantime
the
young
lady
who
had
been
much
struck
by
the
first
appearance
of
the
stranger
knight
continued
to
survey
him
with
increased
attention
and
before
the
conclusion
of
supper
became
so
deeply
enamoured
of
him
that
after
frequent
changes
of
color
and
other
symptoms
which
sir
launcelot
could
not
possibly
mistake
she
was
obliged
to
retire
to
her
chamber
and
seek
relief
in
tears
sir
launcelot
hastened
to
convey
to
her
by
means
of
her
brother
the
information
that
his
heart
was
already
disposed
of
but
that
it
would
be
his
pride
and
pleasure
to
act
as
her
knight
at
the
approaching
tournament
the
lady
obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
that
courtesy
presented
him
her
scarf
to
be
worn
at
the
tournament
launcelot
set
off
in
the
morning
with
the
young
knight
who
on
their
approaching
winchester
carried
him
to
the
castle
of
a
lady
sister
to
the
lord
of
shalott
by
whom
they
were
hospitably
entertained
the
next
day
they
put
on
their
armor
which
was
perfectly
plain
and
without
any
device
as
was
usual
to
youths
during
the
first
year
of
knighthood
their
shields
being
only
painted
red
as
some
color
was
necessary
to
enable
them
to
be
recognized
by
their
attendants
launcelot
wore
on
his
crest
the
scarf
of
the
maid
of
shalott
and
thus
equipped
proceeded
to
the
tournament
where
the
knights
were
divided
into
two
companies
the
one
commanded
by
sir
galehaut
the
other
by
king
arthur
having
surveyed
the
combat
for
a
short
time
from
without
the
lists
and
observed
that
sir
galehaut
party
began
to
give
way
they
joined
the
press
and
attacked
the
royal
knights
the
young
man
choosing
such
adversaries
as
were
suited
to
his
strength
while
his
companion
selected
the
principal
champions
of
the
round
table
and
successively
overthrew
gawain
bohort
and
lionel
the
astonishment
of
the
spectators
was
extreme
for
it
was
thought
that
no
one
but
launcelot
could
possess
such
invincible
force
yet
the
favor
on
his
crest
seemed
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
his
being
thus
disguised
for
launcelot
had
never
been
known
to
wear
the
badge
of
any
but
his
sovereign
lady
at
length
sir
hector
launcelot
brother
engaged
him
and
after
a
dreadful
combat
wounded
him
dangerously
in
the
head
but
was
himself
completely
stunned
by
a
blow
on
the
helmet
and
felled
to
the
ground
after
which
the
conqueror
rode
off
at
full
speed
attended
by
his
companion
they
returned
to
the
castle
of
shalott
where
launcelot
was
attended
with
the
greatest
care
by
the
good
earl
by
his
two
sons
and
above
all
by
his
fair
daughter
whose
medical
skill
probably
much
hastened
the
period
of
his
recovery
his
health
was
almost
completely
restored
when
sir
hector
sir
bohort
and
sir
lionel
who
after
the
return
of
the
court
to
camelot
had
undertaken
the
quest
of
their
relation
discovered
him
walking
on
the
walls
of
the
castle
their
meeting
was
very
joyful
they
passed
three
days
in
the
castle
amidst
constant
festivities
and
bantered
each
other
on
the
events
of
the
tournament
launcelot
though
he
began
by
vowing
vengeance
against
the
author
of
his
wound
yet
ended
by
declaring
that
he
felt
rewarded
for
the
pain
by
the
pride
he
took
in
witnessing
his
brother
extraordinary
prowess
he
then
dismissed
them
with
a
message
to
the
queen
promising
to
follow
immediately
it
being
necessary
that
he
should
first
take
a
formal
leave
of
his
kind
hosts
as
well
as
of
the
fair
maid
of
shalott
the
young
lady
after
vainly
attempting
to
detain
him
by
her
tears
and
solicitations
saw
him
depart
without
leaving
her
any
ground
for
hope
it
was
early
summer
when
the
tournament
took
place
but
some
months
had
passed
since
launcelot
departure
and
winter
was
now
near
at
hand
the
health
and
strength
of
the
lady
of
shalott
had
gradually
sunk
and
she
felt
that
she
could
not
live
apart
from
the
object
of
her
affections
she
left
the
castle
and
descending
to
the
river
brink
placed
herself
in
a
boat
which
she
loosed
from
its
moorings
and
suffered
to
bear
her
down
the
current
toward
camelot
one
morning
as
arthur
and
sir
lionel
looked
from
the
window
of
the
tower
the
walls
of
which
were
washed
by
a
river
they
descried
a
boat
richly
ornamented
and
covered
with
an
awning
of
cloth
of
gold
which
appeared
to
be
floating
down
the
stream
without
any
human
guidance
it
struck
the
shore
while
they
watched
it
and
they
hastened
down
to
examine
it
beneath
the
awning
they
discovered
the
dead
body
of
a
beautiful
woman
in
whose
features
sir
lionel
easily
recognized
the
lovely
maid
of
shalott
pursuing
their
search
they
discovered
a
purse
richly
embroidered
with
gold
and
jewels
and
within
the
purse
a
letter
which
arthur
opened
and
found
addressed
to
himself
and
all
the
knights
of
the
round
table
stating
that
launcelot
of
the
lake
the
most
accomplished
of
knights
and
most
beautiful
of
men
but
at
the
same
time
the
most
cruel
and
inflexible
had
by
his
rigor
produced
the
death
of
the
wretched
maiden
whose
love
was
no
less
invincible
than
his
cruelty
the
king
immediately
gave
orders
for
the
interment
of
the
lady
with
all
the
honors
suited
to
her
rank
at
the
same
time
explaining
to
the
knights
the
history
of
her
affection
for
launcelot
which
moved
the
compassion
and
regret
of
all
tennyson
has
chosen
the
story
of
the
lady
of
shalott
for
the
subject
of
a
poem
the
catastrophe
is
told
thus
under
tower
and
balcony
by
and
gallery
a
gleaming
shape
she
floated
by
a
corse
between
the
houses
high
silent
into
camelot

upon
the
wharfs

came

and
burgher
lord
and
dame
and
round
the
prow
they
read
her
name
lady
of
who
is
this
and
what
is
here
and
in
the
lighted
palace
near
died
the
sound
of
royal
cheer
and
they
crossed
themselves
for
fear
all
the
knights
at
camelot
but
launcelot
mused
a
little
space
he
said
has
a
lovely
face
god
in
his
mercy

her
grace

chapter
xi
queen
guenever
peril
it
happened
at
this
time
that
queen
guenever
was
thrown
into
great
peril
of
her
life
a
certain
squire
who
was
in
her
immediate
service
having
some
cause
of
animosity
to
sir
gawain
determined
to
destroy
him
by
poison
at
a
public
entertainment
for
this
purpose
he
concealed
the
poison
in
an
apple
of
fine
appearance
which
he
placed
on
the
top
of
several
others
and
put
the
dish
before
the
queen
hoping
that
as
sir
gawain
was
the
knight
of
greatest
dignity
she
would
present
the
apple
to
him
but
it
happened
that
a
scottish
knight
of
high
distinction
who
arrived
on
that
day
was
seated
next
to
the
queen
and
to
him
as
a
stranger
she
presented
the
apple
which
he
had
no
sooner
eaten
than
he
was
seized
with
dreadful
pain
and
fell
senseless
the
whole
court
was
of
course
thrown
into
confusion
the
knights
rose
from
table
darting
looks
of
indignation
at
the
wretched
queen
whose
tears
and
protestations
were
unable
to
remove
their
suspicions
in
spite
of
all
that
could
be
done
the
knight
died
and
nothing
remained
but
to
order
a
magnificent
funeral
and
monument
for
him
which
was
done
some
time
after
sir
mador
brother
of
the
murdered
knight
arrived
at
arthur
court
in
quest
of
him
while
hunting
in
the
forest
he
by
chance
came
to
the
spot
where
the
monument
was
erected
read
the
inscription
and
returned
to
court
determined
on
immediate
and
signal
vengeance
he
rode
into
the
hall
loudly
accused
the
queen
of
treason
and
insisted
on
her
being
given
up
for
punishment
unless
she
should
find
by
a
certain
day
a
knight
hardy
enough
to
risk
his
life
in
support
of
her
innocence
arthur
powerful
as
he
was
did
not
dare
to
deny
the
appeal
but
was
compelled
with
a
heavy
heart
to
accept
it
and
mador
sternly
took
his
departure
leaving
the
royal
couple
plunged
in
terror
and
anxiety
during
all
this
time
launcelot
was
absent
and
no
one
knew
where
he
was
he
fled
in
anger
from
his
fair
mistress
upon
being
reproached
by
her
with
his
passion
for
the
lady
of
shalott
which
she
had
hastily
inferred
from
his
wearing
her
scarf
at
the
tournament
he
took
up
his
abode
with
a
hermit
in
the
forest
and
resolved
to
think
no
more
of
the
cruel
beauty
whose
conduct
he
thought
must
flow
from
a
wish
to
get
rid
of
him
yet
calm
reflection
had
somewhat
cooled
his
indignation
and
he
had
begun
to
wish
though
hardly
able
to
hope
for
a
reconciliation
when
the
news
of
sir
mador
challenge
fortunately
reached
his
ears
the
intelligence
revived
his
spirits
and
he
began
to
prepare
with
the
utmost
cheerfulness
for
a
contest
which
if
successful
would
insure
him
at
once
the
affection
of
his
mistress
and
the
gratitude
of
his
sovereign
the
sad
fate
of
the
lady
of
shalott
had
ere
this
completely
acquitted
launcelot
in
the
queen
mind
of
all
suspicion
of
his
fidelity
and
she
lamented
most
grievously
her
foolish
quarrel
with
him
which
now
at
her
time
of
need
deprived
her
of
her
most
efficient
champion
as
the
day
appointed
by
sir
mador
was
fast
approaching
it
became
necessary
that
she
should
procure
a
champion
for
her
defence
and
she
successively
adjured
sir
hector
sir
lionel
sir
bohort
and
sir
gawain
to
undertake
the
battle
she
fell
on
her
knees
before
them
called
heaven
to
witness
her
innocence
of
the
crime
alleged
against
her
but
was
sternly
answered
by
all
that
they
could
not
fight
to
maintain
the
innocence
of
one
whose
act
and
the
fatal
consequence
of
it
they
had
seen
with
their
own
eyes
she
retired
therefore
dejected
and
disconsolate
but
the
sight
of
the
fatal
pile
on
which
if
guilty
she
was
doomed
to
be
burned
exciting
her
to
fresh
effort
she
again
repaired
to
sir
bohort
threw
herself
at
his
feet
and
piteously
calling
on
him
for
mercy
fell
into
a
swoon
the
brave
knight
was
not
proof
against
this
he
raised
her
up
and
hastily
promised
that
he
would
undertake
her
cause
if
no
other
or
better
champion
should
present
himself
he
then
summoned
his
friends
and
told
them
his
resolution
and
as
a
mortal
combat
with
sir
mador
was
a
most
fearful
enterprise
they
agreed
to
accompany
him
in
the
morning
to
the
hermitage
in
the
forest
where
he
proposed
to
receive
absolution
from
the
hermit
and
to
make
his
peace
with
heaven
before
he
entered
the
lists
as
they
approached
the
hermitage
they
espied
a
knight
riding
in
the
forest
whom
they
at
once
recognized
as
sir
launcelot
overjoyed
at
the
meeting
they
quickly
in
answer
to
his
questions
confirmed
the
news
of
the
queen
imminent
danger
and
received
his
instructions
to
return
to
court
to
comfort
her
as
well
as
they
could
but
to
say
nothing
of
his
intention
of
undertaking
her
defence
which
he
meant
to
do
in
tne
character
of
an
unknown
adventurer
on
their
return
to
the
castle
they
found
that
mass
was
finished
and
had
scarcely
time
to
speak
to
the
queen
before
they
were
summoned
into
the
hall
to
dinner
a
general
gloom
was
spread
over
the
countenances
of
all
the
guests
arthur
himself
was
unable
to
conceal
his
dejection
and
the
wretched
guenever
motionless
and
bathed
in
tears
sat
in
trembling
expectation
of
sir
appearance
nor
was
it
long
ere
he
stalked
into
the
hall
and
with
a
voice
of
thunder
rendered
more
impressive
by
the
general
silence
demanded
instant
justice
on
the
guilty
party
arthur
replied
with
dignity
that
little
of
the
day
was
yet
spent
and
that
perhaps
a
champion
might
yet
be
found
capable
of
satisfying
his
thirst
for
battle
sir
bohort
now
rose
from
table
and
shortly
returning
in
complete
armor
resumed
his
place
after
receiving
the
embraces
and
thanks
of
the
king
who
now
began
to
resume
some
degree
of
confidence
sir
mador
growing
impatient
again
repeated
his
denunciations
of
vengeance
and
insisted
that
the
combat
should
no
longer
be
postponed
in
the
height
of
the
debate
there
came
riding
into
the
hall
a
knight
mounted
on
a
black
steed
and
clad
in
black
armor
with
his
visor
down
and
lance
in
hand
sir
said
the
king
is
it
your
will
to
alight
and
partake
of
our
cheer
nay
sir
he
replied
i
come
to
save
a
lady
life
the
queen
hath
ill
bestowed
her
favors
and
honored
many
a
knight
that
in
her
hour
of
need
she
should
have
none
to
take
her
part
thou
that
darest
accuse
her
of
treachery
stand
forth
for
shalt
thou
need
all
thy
might
sir
mador
though
surprised
was
not
appalled
by
the
stern
challenge
and
formidable
appearance
of
his
antagonist
but
prepared
for
the
encounter
at
the
first
shock
both
were
unhorsed
they
then
drew
their
swords
and
commenced
a
combat
which
lasted
from
noon
till
evening
when
sir
mador
whose
strength
began
to
fail
was
felled
to
the
ground
by
launcelot
and
compelled
to
sue
for
mercy
the
victor
whose
arm
was
already
raised
to
terminate
the
life
of
his
opponent
instantly
dropped
his
sword
courteously
lifted
up
the
fainting
sir
mador
frankly
confessing
that
he
had
never
before
encountered
so
formidable
an
enemy
the
other
with
similar
courtesy
solemnly
renounced
all
further
projects
of
vengeance
for
his
brother
death
and
the
two
knights
now
become
fast
friends
embraced
each
other
with
the
greatest
cordiality
in
the
meantime
arthur
having
recognized
sir
launcelot
whose
helmet
was
now
unlaced
rushed
down
into
the
lists
followed
by
all
his
knights
to
welcome
and
thank
his
deliverer
guenever
swooned
with
joy
and
the
place
of
combat
suddenly
exhibited
a
scene
of
the
most
tumultuous
delight
the
general
satisfaction
was
still
further
increased
by
the
discovery
of
the
real
culprit
having
accidentally
incurred
some
suspicion
he
confessed
his
crime
and
was
publicly
punished
in
the
presence
of
sir
mador
the
court
now
returned
to
the
castle
which
with
the
title
of
la
joyeuse
garde
bestowed
upon
it
in
memory
of
the
happy
event
was
conferred
on
sir
launcelot
by
arthur
as
a
memorial
of
his
gratitude

a
country
famous
in
the
annals
of
romance
which
adjoined
the
kingdom
of
cornwall
but
has
now
disappeared
from
the
map
having
been
it
is
said
overwhelmed
by
the
ocean
meliadus
was
married
to
isabella
sister
of
mark
king
of
cornwall
a
fairy
fell
in
love
with
him
and
drew
him
away
by
enchantment
while
he
was
engaged
in
hunting
his
queen
set
out
in
quest
of
him
but
was
taken
ill
on
her
journey
and
died
leaving
an
infant
son
whom
from
the
melancholy
circumstances
of
his
birth
she
called
tristram
gouvernail
the
queen
squire
who
had
accompanied
her
took
charge
of
the
child
and
restored
him
to
his
father
who
had
at
length
burst
the
enchantments
of
the
fairy
and
returned
home
meliadus
after
seven
years
married
again
and
the
new
queen
being
jealous
of
the
influence
of
tristram
with
his
father
laid
plots
for
his
life
which
were
discovered
by
gouvernail
who
in
consequence
fled
with
the
boy
to
the
court
of
the
king
of
france
where
tristram
was
kindly
received
and
grew
up
improving
in
every
gallant
and
knightly
accomplishment
adding
to
his
skill
in
arms
the
arts
of
music
and
of
chess
in
particular
he
devoted
himself
to
the
chase
and
to
all
woodland
sports
so
that
he
became
distinguished
above
all
other
chevaliers
of
the
court
for
his
knowledge
of
all
that
relates
to
hunting
no
wonder
that
belinda
the
king
daughter
fell
in
love
with
him
but
as
he
did
not
return
her
passion
she
in
a
sudden
impulse
of
anger
excited
her
father
against
him
and
he
was
banished
the
kingdom
the
princess
soon
repented
of
her
act
and
in
despair
destroyed
herself
having
first
written
a
most
tender
letter
to
tristram
sending
him
at
the
same
time
a
beautiful
and
sagacious
dog
of
which
she
was
very
fond
desiring
him
to
keep
it
as
a
memorial
of
her
meliadus
was
now
dead
and
as
his
queen
tristram
stepmother
held
the
throne
gouvernail
was
afraid
to
carry
his
pupil
to
his
native
country
and
took
him
to
cornwall
to
his
uncle
mark
who
gave
him
a
kind
reception
king
mark
resided
at
the
castle
of
tintadel
already
mentioned
in
the
history
of
uther
and
igerne
in
this
court
tristram
became
distinguished
in
all
the
exercises
incumbent
on
a
knight
nor
was
it
long
before
he
had
an
opportunity
of
practically
employing
his
valor
and
skill
moraunt
a
celebrated
champion
brother
to
the
queen
of
ireland
arrived
at
the
court
to
demand
tribute
of
king
mark
the
knights
of
cornwall
are
in
ill
repute
in
romance
for
their
cowardice
and
they
exhibited
it
on
this
occasion
king
mark
could
find
no
champion
who
dared
to
encounter
the
irish
knight
till
his
nephew
tristram
who
had
not
yet
received
the
honors
of
knighthood
craved
to
be
admitted
to
the
order
offering
at
the
same
time
to
fight
the
battle
of
cornwall
against
the
irish
champion
king
mark
assented
with
reluctance
tristram
received
the
accolade
which
conferred
knighthood
upon
him
and
the
place
and
time
were
assigned
for
the
encounter
without
attempting
to
give
the
details
of
this
famous
combat
the
first
and
one
of
the
most
glorious
of
tristram
exploits
we
shall
only
say
that
the
young
knight
though
severely
wounded
cleft
the
head
of
moraunt
leaving
a
portion
of
his
sword
in
the
wound
moraunt
half
dead
with
his
wound
and
the
disgrace
of
his
defeat
hastened
to
hide
himself
in
his
ship
sailed
away
with
all
speed
for
ireland
and
died
soon
after
arriving
in
his
own
country
the
kingdom
of
cornwall
was
thus
delivered
from
its
tribute
tristram
weakened
by
loss
of
blood
fell
senseless
his
friends
flew
to
his
assistance
they
dressed
his
wounds
which
in
general
healed
readily
but
the
lance
of
moraunt
was
poisoned
and
one
wound
which
it
made
yielded
to
no
remedies
but
grew
worse
day
by
day
the
surgeons
could
do
no
more
tristram
asked
permission
of
his
uncle
to
depart
and
seek
for
aid
in
the
kingdom
of
loegria
england
with
his
consent
he
embarked
and
after
tossing
for
many
days
on
the
sea
was
driven
by
the
winds
to
the
coast
of
ireland
he
landed
full
of
joy
and
gratitude
that
he
had
escaped
the
peril
of
the
sea
took
his
rote
footnote
a
musical
instrument
and
began
to
play
it
was
a
summer
evening
and
the
king
of
ireland
and
his
daughter
the
beautiful
isoude
were
at
a
window
which
overlooked
the
sea
the
strange
harper
was
sent
for
and
conveyed
to
the
palace
where
finding
that
he
was
in
ireland
whose
champion
he
had
lately
slain
he
concealed
his
name
and
called
himself
tramtris
the
queen
undertook
his
cure
and
by
a
medicated
bath
gradually
restored
him
to
health
his
skill
in
music
and
in
games
occasioned
his
being
frequently
called
to
court
and
he
became
the
instructor
of
the
princess
isoude
in
minstrelsy
and
poetry
who
profited
so
well
under
his
care
that
she
soon
had
no
equal
in
the
kingdom
except
her
instructor
at
this
time
a
tournament
was
held
at
which
many
knights
of
the
round
table
and
others
were
present
on
the
first
day
a
saracen
prince
named
palamedes
obtained
the
advantage
over
all
they
brought
him
to
the
court
and
gave
him
a
feast
at
which
tristram
just
recovering
from
his
wound
was
present
the
fair
isoude
appeared
on
this
occasion
in
all
her
charms
palamedes
could
not
behold
them
without
emotion
and
made
no
effort
to
conceal
his
love
tristram
perceived
it
and
the
pain
he
felt
from
jealousy
taught
him
how
dear
the
fair
isoude
had
already
become
to
him
next
day
the
tournament
was
renewed
tristram
still
feeble
from
his
wound
rose
during
the
night
took
his
arms
and
concealed
them
in
a
forest
near
the
place
of
the
contest
and
after
it
had
begun
mingled
with
the
combatants
he
overthrew
all
that
encountered
him
in
particular
palamedes
whom
he
brought
to
the
ground
with
a
stroke
of
his
lance
and
then
fought
him
hand
to
hand
bearing
off
the
prize
of
the
tourney
but
his
exertions
caused
his
wound
to
reopen
he
bled
fast
and
in
this
sad
state
yet
in
triumph
they
bore
him
to
the
palace
the
fair
isoude
devoted
herself
to
his
relief
with
an
interest
which
grew
more
vivid
day
by
day
and
her
skilful
care
soon
restored
him
to
health
it
happened
one
day
that
a
damsel
of
the
court
entering
the
closet
where
tristram
arms
were
deposited
perceived
that
a
part
of
the
sword
had
been
broken
off
it
occurred
to
her
that
the
missing
portion
was
like
that
which
was
left
in
the
skull
of
moraunt
the
irish
champion
she
imparted
her
thought
to
the
queen
who
compared
the
fragment
taken
from
her
brother
wound
with
the
sword
of
tristram
and
was
satisfied
that
it
was
part
of
the
same
and
that
the
weapon
of
tristram
was
that
which
reft
her
brother
life
she
laid
her
griefs
and
resentment
before
the
king
who
satisfied
himself
with
his
own
eyes
of
the
truth
of
her
suspicions
tristram
was
cited
before
the
whole
court
and
reproached
with
having
dared
to
present
himself
before
them
after
having
slain
their
kinsman
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
fought
with
moraunt
to
settle
the
claim
for
tribute
and
said
that
it
was
by
force
of
winds
and
waves
alone
that
he
was
thrown
on
their
coast
the
queen
demanded
vengeance
for
the
death
of
her
brother
the
fair
isoude
trembled
and
grew
pale
but
a
murmur
rose
from
all
the
assembly
that
the
life
of
one
so
handsome
and
so
brave
should
not
be
taken
for
such
a
cause
and
generosity
finally
triumphed
over
resentment
in
the
mind
of
the
king
tristram
was
dismissed
in
safety
but
commanded
to
leave
the
kingdom
without
delay
and
never
to
return
thither
under
pain
of
death
tristram
went
back
with
restored
health
to
cornwall
king
mark
made
his
nephew
give
him
a
minute
recital
of
his
adventures
tristram
told
him
all
minutely
but
when
he
came
to
speak
of
the
fair
isoude
he
described
her
charms
with
a
warmth
and
energy
such
as
none
but
a
lover
could
display
king
mark
was
fascinated
with
the
description
and
choosing
a
favorable
time
demanded
a
boon
footnote
good
faith
was
the
very
of
chivalry
whenever
a
knight
word
was
pledged
it
mattered
not
how
rashly
it
was
to
be
redeemed
at
any
price
hence
the
sacred
obligation
of
the
boon
granted
by
a
knight
to
his
suppliant
instances
without
number
occur
in
romance
in
which
a
knight
by
rashly
granting
an
indefinite
boon
was
obliged
to
do
or
suffer
something
extremely
to
his
prejudice
but
it
is
not
in
romance
alone
that
we
find
such
singular
instances
of
adherence
to
an
indefinite
promise
the
history
of
the
times
presents
authentic
transactions
equally
embarrassing
and
absurd
scott
note
to
sir
tristram
of
his
nephew
who
readily
granted
it
the
king
made
him
swear
upon
the
holy
reliques
that
he
would
fulfil
his
commands
then
mark
directed
him
to
go
to
ireland
and
obtain
for
him
the
fair
isoude
to
be
queen
of
cornwall
tristram
believed
it
was
certain
death
for
him
to
return
to
ireland
and
how
could
he
act
as
ambassador
for
his
uncle
in
such
a
cause
yet
bound
by
his
oath
he
hesitated
not
for
an
instant
he
only
took
the
precaution
to
change
his
armor
he
embarked
for
ireland
but
a
tempest
drove
him
to
the
coast
of
england
near
camelot
where
king
arthur
was
holding
his
court
attended
by
the
knights
of
the
round
table
and
many
others
the
most
illustrious
in
the
world
tristram
kept
himself
unknown
he
took
part
in
many
justs
he
fought
many
combats
in
which
he
covered
himself
with
glory
one
day
he
saw
among
those
recently
arrived
the
king
of
ireland
father
of
the
fair
isoude
this
prince
accused
of
treason
against
his
liege
sovereign
arthur
came
to
camelot
to
free
himself
from
the
charge
blaanor
one
of
the
most
redoubtable
warriors
of
the
round
table
was
his
accuser
and
argius
the
king
had
neither
youthful
vigor
nor
strength
to
encounter
him
he
must
therefore
seek
a
champion
to
sustain
his
innocence
but
the
knights
of
the
round
table
were
not
at
liberty
to
fight
against
one
another
unless
in
a
quarrel
of
their
own
argius
heard
of
the
great
renown
of
the
unknown
knight
he
also
was
witness
of
his
exploits
he
sought
him
and
conjured
him
to
adopt
his
defence
and
on
his
oath
declared
that
he
was
innocent
of
the
crime
of
which
he
was
accused
tristram
readily
consented
and
made
himself
known
to
the
king
who
on
his
part
promised
to
reward
his
exertions
if
successful
with
whatever
gift
he
might
ask
tristram
fought
with
blaanor
and
overthrew
him
and
held
his
life
in
his
power
the
fallen
warrior
called
on
him
to
use
his
right
of
conquest
and
strike
the
fatal
blow
god
forbid
said
tristram
that
i
should
take
the
life
of
so
brave
a
knight
he
raised
him
up
and
restored
him
to
his
friends
the
judges
of
the
field
decided
that
the
king
of
ireland
was
acquitted
of
the
charge
against
him
and
they
led
tristram
in
triumph
to
his
tent
king
argius
full
of
gratitude
conjured
tristram
to
accompany
him
to
his
kingdom
they
departed
together
and
arrived
in
ireland
and
the
queen
forgetting
her
resentment
for
her
brother
death
exhibited
to
the
preserver
of
her
husband
life
nothing
but
gratitude
and
how
happy
a
moment
for
isoude
who
knew
that
her
father
had
promised
his
deliverer
whatever
boon
he
might
ask
but
the
unhappy
tristram
gazed
on
her
with
despair
at
the
thought
of
the
cruel
oath
which
bound
him
his
magnanimous
soul
subdued
the
force
of
his
love
he
revealed
the
oath
which
he
had
taken
and
with
trembling
voice
demanded
the
fair
isoude
for
his
uncle
argius
consented
and
soon
all
was
prepared
for
the
departure
of
isoude
brengwain
her
favorite
maid
of
honor
was
to
accompany
her
on
the
day
of
departure
the
queen
took
aside
this
devoted
attendant
and
told
her
that
she
had
observed
that
her
daughter
and
tristram
were
attached
to
one
another
and
that
to
avert
the
bad
effects
of
this
inclination
she
had
procured
from
a
powerful
fairy
a
potent
philter
which
she
directed
brengwain
to
administer
to
isoude
and
to
king
mark
on
the
evening
of
their
marriage
isoude
and
tristram
embarked
together
a
favorable
wind
filled
the
sails
and
promised
them
a
fortunate
voyage
the
lovers
gazed
upon
one
another
and
could
not
repress
their
sighs
love
seemed
to
light
up
all
his
fires
on
their
lips
as
in
their
hearts
the
day
was
warm
they
suffered
from
thirst
isoude
first
complained
tristram
descried
the
bottle
containing
the
which
brengwain
had
been
so
imprudent
as
to
leave
in
sight
he
took
it
gave
some
of
it
to
the
charming
isoude
and
drank
the
remainder
himself
the
dog
houdain
licked
the
cup
the
ship
arrived
in
cornwall
and
isoude
was
married
to
king
mark
the
old
monarch
was
delighted
with
his
bride
and
his
gratitude
to
tristram
was
unbounded
he
loaded
him
with
honors
and
made
him
chamberlain
of
his
palace
thus
giving
him
access
to
the
queen
at
all
times
in
the
midst
of
the
festivities
of
the
court
which
followed
the
royal
marriage
an
unknown
minstrel
one
day
presented
himself
bearing
a
harp
of
peculiar
construction
he
excited
the
curiosity
of
king
mark
by
refusing
to
play
upon
it
till
he
should
grant
him
a
boon
the
king
having
promised
to
grant
his
request
the
minstrel
who
was
none
other
than
the
saracen
knight
sir
palamedes
the
lover
of
the
fair
isoude
sung
to
the
harp
a
lay
in
which
he
demanded
isoude
as
the
promised
gift
king
mark
could
not
by
the
laws
of
knighthood
withhold
the
boon
the
lady
was
mounted
on
her
horse
and
led
away
by
her
triumphant
lover
tristram
it
is
needless
to
say
was
absent
at
the
time
and
did
not
return
until
their
departure
when
he
heard
what
had
taken
place
he
seized
his
rote
and
hastened
to
the
shore
where
isoude
and
her
new
master
had
already
embarked
tristram
played
upon
his
rote
and
the
sound
reached
the
ears
of
isoude
who
became
so
deeply
affected
that
sir
palamedes
was
induced
to
return
with
her
to
land
that
they
might
see
the
unknown
musician
tristram
watched
his
opportunity
seized
the
lady
horse
by
the
bridle
and
plunged
with
her
into
the
forest
tauntingly
informing
his
rival
that
what
he
had
got
by
the
harp
he
had
lost
by
the
rote
palamedes
pursued
and
a
combat
was
about
to
commence
the
result
of
which
must
have
been
fatal
to
one
or
other
of
these
gallant
knights
but
isoude
stepped
between
them
and
addressing
palamedes
said
you
tell
me
that
you
love
me
you
will
not
then
deny
me
the
request
i
am
about
to
make
lady
he
replied
i
will
perform
your
bidding
leave
then
said
she
this
contest
and
repair
to
king
arthur
court
and
salute
queen
guenever
from
me
tell
her
that
there
are
in
the
world
but
two
ladies
herself
and
i
and
two
lovers
hers
and
mine
and
come
thou
not
in
future
in
any
place
where
i
am
palamedes
burst
into
tears
ah
lady
said
he
i
will
obey
you
but
i
beseech
you
that
you
will
not
for
ever
steel
your
heart
against
me
palamedes
she
replied
may
i
never
taste
of
joy
again
if
i
ever
quit
my
first
love
palamedes
then
went
his
way
the
lovers
remained
a
week
in
concealment
after
which
tristram
restored
isoude
to
her
husband
advising
him
in
future
to
reward
minstrels
in
some
other
way
the
king
showed
much
gratitude
to
tristram
but
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
cherished
bitter
jealousy
of
him
one
day
tristram
and
isoude
were
alone
together
in
her
private
chamber
a
base
and
cowardly
knight
of
the
court
named
andret
spied
them
through
a
keyhole
they
sat
at
a
table
of
chess
but
were
not
attending
to
the
game
andret
brought
the
king
having
first
raised
his
suspicions
and
placed
him
so
as
to
watch
their
motions
the
king
saw
enough
to
confirm
his
suspicions
and
he
burst
into
the
apartment
with
his
sword
drawn
and
had
nearly
slain
tristram
before
he
was
put
on
his
guard
but
tristram
avoided
the
blow
drew
his
sword
and
drove
before
him
the
cowardly
monarch
chasing
him
through
all
the
apartments
of
the
palace
giving
him
frequent
blows
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
while
he
cried
in
vain
to
his
knights
to
save
him
they
were
not
inclined
or
did
not
dare
to
interpose
in
his
behalf
a
proof
of
the
great
popularity
of
the
tale
of
sir
tristram
is
the
fact
that
the
italian
poets
boiardo
and
ariosto
have
founded
upon
it
the
idea
of
the
two
enchanted
fountains
which
produced
the
opposite
effects
of
love
and
hatred
boiardo
thus
describes
the
fountain
of
hatred
fair
was
that
fountain
sculptured
all
of
gold
with
alabaster
sculptured
rich
and
rare
and
in
its
basin
clear
thou
behold
the
flowery
marge
reflected
fresh
and
fair
sage
merlin
framed
the
font
so
legends
bear
when
on
fair
isoude
doated
tristram
brave
that
the
good
errant
knight
arriving
there
might
quaff
oblivion
in
the
enchanted
wave
and
leave
his
luckless
love
and
his
timeless
grave
the
warrior
evil
fate
allowed
his
steps
that
fountain
charmed
verge
to
gain
though
restless
roving
on
adventure
proud
he
traversed
oft
the
land
and
oft
the
main
chapter
xiii
tristram
and
isoude
continued
after
this
affair
tristram
was
banished
from
the
kingdom
and
isoude
shut
up
in
a
tower
which
stood
on
the
bank
of
a
river
tristram
could
not
resolve
to
depart
without
some
further
communication
with
his
beloved
so
he
concealed
himself
in
the
forest
till
at
last
he
contrived
to
attract
her
attention
by
means
of
twigs
which
he
curiously
peeled
and
sent
down
the
stream
under
her
window
by
this
means
many
secret
interviews
were
obtained
tristram
dwelt
in
the
forest
sustaining
himself
by
game
which
the
dog
houdain
ran
down
for
him
for
this
faithful
animal
was
unequalled
in
the
chase
and
knew
so
well
his
wish
for
concealment
that
in
the
pursuit
of
his
game
he
never
barked
at
length
tristram
departed
but
left
houdain
with
isoude
as
a
remembrancer
of
him
sir
tristram
wandered
through
various
countries
achieving
the
most
perilous
enterprises
and
covering
himself
with
glory
yet
unhappy
at
the
separation
from
his
beloved
isoude
at
length
king
mark
territory
was
invaded
by
a
neighboring
chieftain
and
he
was
forced
to
summon
his
nephew
to
his
aid
tristram
obeyed
the
call
put
himself
at
the
head
of
his
uncle
vassals
and
drove
the
enemy
out
of
the
country
mark
was
full
of
gratitude
and
tristram
restored
to
favor
and
to
the
society
of
his
beloved
isoude
seemed
at
the
summit
of
happiness
but
a
sad
reverse
was
at
hand
tristram
had
brought
with
him
a
friend
named
pheredin
son
of
the
king
of
brittany
this
young
knight
saw
queen
isoude
and
could
not
resist
her
charms
knowing
the
love
of
his
friend
for
the
queen
and
that
that
love
was
returned
pheredin
concealed
his
own
until
his
health
failed
and
he
feared
he
was
drawing
near
his
end
he
then
wrote
to
the
beautiful
queen
that
he
was
dying
for
love
of
her
the
gentle
isoude
in
a
moment
of
pity
for
the
friend
of
tristram
returned
him
an
answer
so
kind
and
compassionate
that
it
restored
him
to
life
a
few
days
afterwards
tristram
found
this
letter
the
most
terrible
jealousy
took
possession
of
his
soul
he
would
have
slain
pheredin
who
with
difficulty
made
his
escape
then
tristram
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
to
the
forest
where
for
ten
days
he
took
no
rest
nor
food
at
length
he
was
found
by
a
damsel
lying
almost
dead
by
the
brink
of
a
fountain
she
recognized
him
and
tried
in
vain
to
rouse
his
attention
at
last
recollecting
his
love
for
music
she
went
and
got
her
harp
and
played
thereon
tristram
was
roused
from
his
reverie
tears
flowed
he
breathed
more
freely
he
took
the
harp
from
the
maiden
and
sung
this
lay
with
a
voice
broken
with
sobs
sweet
i
sang
in
former
days
kind
love
perfected
my
lays
now
my
art
alone
displays
the
woe
that
on
my
being
preys
charming
love
delicious
power
worshipped
from
my
earliest
hour
thou
who
life
on
all
dost
shower
love
my
life
thou
dost
devour
in
death
hour
i
beg
of
thee
isoude
dearest
enemy
thou
who
erst
couldst
kinder
be
when
i
gone
forget
not
me
on
my
gravestone
oft
will
read
as
low
i
lie
wight
in
love
could
vie
with
tristram
yet
she
let
him
die
tristram
having
finished
his
lay
wrote
it
off
and
gave
it
to
the
damsel
conjuring
her
to
present
it
to
the
queen
meanwhile
queen
isoude
was
inconsolable
at
the
absence
of
tristram
she
discovered
that
it
was
caused
by
the
fatal
letter
which
she
had
written
to
pheredin
innocent
but
in
despair
at
the
sad
effects
of
her
letter
she
wrote
another
to
pheredin
charging
him
never
to
see
her
again
the
unhappy
lover
obeyed
this
cruel
decree
he
plunged
into
the
forest
and
died
of
grief
and
love
in
a
hermit
cell
isoude
passed
her
days
in
lamenting
the
absence
and
unknown
fate
of
tristram
one
day
her
jealous
husband
having
entered
her
chamber
unperceived
overheard
her
singing
the
following
lay
my
voice
to
piteous
wail
is
bent
my
harp
to
notes
of
languishment
ah
love
delightsome
days
be
meant
for
happier
wights
with
hearts
content
ah
tristram
far
away
from
me
art
thou
from
restless
anguish
free
ah
couldst
thou
so
one
moment
be
from
her
who
so
much
loveth
thee
the
king
hearing
these
words
burst
forth
in
a
rage
but
isoude
was
too
wretched
to
fear
his
violence
you
have
heard
me
she
said
i
confess
it
all
i
love
tristram
and
always
shall
love
him
without
doubt
he
is
dead
and
died
for
me
i
no
longer
wish
to
live
the
blow
that
shall
finish
my
misery
will
be
most
welcome
the
king
was
moved
at
the
distress
of
the
fair
isoude
and
perhaps
the
idea
of
tristram
death
tended
to
allay
his
wrath
he
left
the
queen
in
charge
of
her
women
commanding
them
to
take
especial
care
lest
her
despair
should
lead
her
to
do
harm
to
herself
tristram
meanwhile
distracted
as
he
was
rendered
a
most
important
service
to
the
shepherds
by
slaying
a
gigantic
robber
named
taullas
who
was
in
the
habit
of
plundering
their
flocks
and
rifling
their
cottages
the
shepherds
in
their
gratitude
to
tristram
bore
him
in
triumph
to
king
mark
to
have
him
bestow
on
him
a
suitable
reward
no
wonder
mark
failed
to
recognize
in
the
wild
man
before
him
his
nephew
tristram
but
grateful
for
the
service
the
unknown
had
rendered
he
ordered
him
to
be
well
taken
care
of
and
gave
him
in
charge
to
the
queen
and
her
women
under
such
care
tristram
rapidly
recovered
his
serenity
and
his
health
so
that
the
romancer
tells
us
he
became
handsomer
than
ever
king
mark
jealousy
revived
with
tristram
health
and
good
looks
and
in
spite
of
his
debt
of
gratitude
so
lately
increased
he
again
banished
him
from
the
court
sir
tristram
left
cornwall
and
proceeded
into
the
land
of
loegria
england
in
quest
of
adventures
one
day
he
entered
a
wide
forest
the
sound
of
a
little
bell
showed
him
that
some
inhabitant
was
near
he
followed
the
sound
and
found
a
hermit
who
informed
him
that
he
was
in
the
forest
of
arnantes
belonging
to
the
fairy
viviane
the
lady
of
the
lake
who
smitten
with
love
for
king
arthur
had
found
means
to
entice
him
to
this
forest
where
by
enchantments
she
held
him
a
prisoner
having
deprived
him
of
all
memory
of
who
and
what
he
was
the
hermit
informed
him
that
all
the
knights
of
the
round
table
were
out
in
search
of
the
king
and
that
he
tristram
was
now
in
the
scene
of
the
most
grand
and
important
adventures
this
was
enough
to
animate
tristram
in
the
search
he
had
not
wandered
far
before
he
encountered
a
knight
of
arthur
court
who
proved
to
be
sir
kay
the
seneschal
who
demanded
of
him
whence
he
came
tristram
answering
from
cornwall
sir
kay
did
not
let
slip
the
opportunity
of
a
joke
at
the
expense
of
the
cornish
knight
tristram
chose
to
leave
him
in
his
error
and
even
confirmed
him
in
it
for
meeting
some
other
knights
tristram
declined
to
just
with
them
they
spent
the
night
together
at
an
abbey
where
tristram
submitted
patiently
to
all
their
jokes
the
seneschal
gave
the
word
to
his
companions
that
they
should
set
out
early
next
day
and
intercept
the
cornish
knight
on
his
way
and
enjoy
the
amusement
of
seeing
his
fright
when
they
should
insist
on
running
a
tilt
with
him
tristram
next
morning
found
himself
alone
he
put
on
his
armor
and
set
out
to
continue
his
quest
he
soon
saw
before
him
the
seneschal
and
the
three
knights
who
barred
the
way
and
insisted
on
a
just
tristram
excused
himself
a
long
time
at
last
he
reluctantly
took
his
stand
he
encountered
them
one
after
the
other
and
overthrew
them
all
four
man
and
horse
and
then
rode
off
bidding
them
not
to
forget
their
friend
the
knight
of
cornwall
tristram
had
not
ridden
far
when
he
met
a
damsel
who
cried
out
ah
my
lord
hasten
forward
and
prevent
a
horrid
treason
tristram
flew
to
her
assistance
and
soon
reached
a
spot
where
he
beheld
a
knight
whom
three
others
had
borne
to
the
ground
and
were
unlacing
his
helmet
in
order
to
cut
off
his
head
tristram
flew
to
the
rescue
and
slew
with
one
stroke
of
his
lance
one
of
the
assailants
the
knight
recovering
his
feet
sacrificed
another
to
his
vengeance
and
the
third
made
his
escape
the
rescued
knight
then
raised
the
visor
of
his
helmet
and
a
long
white
beard
fell
down
upon
his
breast
the
majesty
and
venerable
air
of
this
knight
made
tristram
suspect
that
it
was
none
other
than
arthur
himself
and
the
prince
confirmed
his
conjecture
tristram
would
have
knelt
before
him
but
arthur
received
him
in
his
arms
and
inquired
his
name
and
country
but
tristram
declined
to
disclose
them
on
the
plea
that
he
was
now
on
a
quest
requiring
secrecy
at
this
moment
the
damsel
who
had
brought
tristram
to
the
rescue
darted
forward
and
seizing
the
king
hand
drew
from
his
finger
a
ring
the
gift
of
the
fairy
and
by
that
act
dissolved
the
enchantment
arthur
having
recovered
his
reason
and
his
memory
offered
to
tristram
to
attach
him
to
his
court
and
to
confer
honors
and
dignities
upon
him
but
tristram
declined
all
and
only
consented
to
accompany
him
till
he
should
see
him
safe
in
the
hands
of
his
knights
soon
after
hector
de
marys
rode
up
and
saluted
the
king
who
on
his
part
introduced
him
to
tristram
as
one
of
the
bravest
of
his
knights
tristram
took
leave
of
the
king
and
his
faithful
follower
and
continued
his
quest
we
can
not
follow
tristram
through
all
the
adventures
which
filled
this
epoch
of
his
history
suffice
it
to
say
he
fulfilled
on
all
occasions
the
duty
of
a
true
knight
rescuing
the
oppressed
redressing
wrongs
abolishing
evil
customs
and
suppressing
injustice
thus
by
constant
action
endeavoring
to
lighten
the
pains
of
absence
from
her
he
loved
in
the
meantime
isoude
separated
from
her
dear
tristram
passed
her
days
in
languor
and
regret
at
length
she
could
no
longer
resist
the
desire
to
hear
some
news
of
her
lover
she
wrote
a
letter
and
sent
it
by
one
of
her
damsels
niece
of
her
faithful
brengwain
one
day
tristram
weary
with
his
exertions
had
dismounted
and
laid
himself
down
by
the
side
of
a
fountain
and
fallen
asleep
the
damsel
of
queen
isoude
arrived
at
the
same
fountain
and
recognized
passebreul
the
horse
of
tristram
and
presently
perceived
his
master
asleep
he
was
thin
and
pale
showing
evident
marks
of
the
pain
he
suffered
in
separation
from
his
beloved
she
awakened
him
and
gave
him
the
letter
which
she
bore
and
tristram
enjoyed
the
pleasure
so
sweet
to
a
lover
of
hearing
from
and
talking
about
the
object
of
his
affections
he
prayed
the
damsel
to
postpone
her
return
till
after
the
magnificent
tournament
which
arthur
had
proclaimed
should
have
taken
place
and
conducted
her
to
the
castle
of
persides
a
brave
and
loyal
knight
who
received
her
with
great
consideration
tristram
conducted
the
damsel
of
queen
isoude
to
the
tournament
and
had
her
placed
in
the
balcony
among
the
ladies
of
the
queen
he
glanced
and
saw
the
stately
galleries
dame
damsel
each
through
worship
of
their
queen
in
honor
of
the
stainless
child
and
some
with
scatter
jewels
like
a
bank
of
maiden
snow
mingled
with
sparks
of
fire
he
looked
but
once
and
veiled
his
eyes
again
the
last
tournament
he
then
joined
the
tourney
nothing
could
exceed
his
strength
and
valor
launcelot
admired
him
and
by
a
secret
presentiment
declined
to
dispute
the
honor
of
the
day
with
a
knight
so
gallant
and
so
skilful
arthur
descended
from
the
balcony
to
greet
the
conqueror
but
the
modest
and
devoted
tristram
content
with
having
borne
off
the
prize
in
the
sight
of
the
messenger
of
isoude
made
his
escape
with
her
and
disappeared
the
next
day
the
tourney
recommenced
tristram
assumed
different
armor
that
he
might
not
be
known
but
he
was
soon
detected
by
the
terrible
blows
that
he
gave
arthur
and
guenever
had
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
same
knight
who
had
borne
off
the
prize
of
the
day
before
arthur
gallant
spirit
was
roused
after
launcelot
of
the
lake
and
sir
gawain
he
was
accounted
the
best
knight
of
the
round
table
he
went
privately
and
armed
himself
and
came
into
the
tourney
in
undistinguished
armor
he
ran
a
just
with
tristram
whom
he
shook
in
his
seat
but
tristram
who
did
not
know
him
threw
him
out
of
the
saddle
arthur
recovered
himself
and
content
with
having
made
proof
of
the
stranger
knight
bade
launcelot
finish
the
adventure
and
vindicate
the
honor
of
the
round
table
sir
launcelot
at
the
bidding
of
the
monarch
assailed
tristram
whose
lance
was
already
broken
in
former
encounters
but
the
law
of
this
sort
of
combat
was
that
the
knight
after
having
broken
his
lance
must
fight
with
his
sword
and
must
not
refuse
to
meet
with
his
shield
the
lance
of
his
antagonist
tristram
met
charge
upon
his
shield
which
that
terrible
lance
could
not
fail
to
pierce
it
inflicted
a
wound
upon
tristram
side
and
breaking
left
the
iron
in
the
wound
but
tristram
also
with
his
sword
smote
so
vigorously
on
launcelot
casque
that
he
cleft
it
and
wounded
his
head
the
wound
was
not
deep
but
the
blood
flowed
into
his
eyes
and
blinded
him
for
a
moment
and
tristram
who
thought
himself
mortally
wounded
retired
from
the
field
launcelot
declared
to
the
king
that
he
had
never
received
such
a
blow
in
his
life
before
tristram
hastened
to
gouvernail
his
squire
who
drew
forth
the
iron
bound
up
the
wound
and
gave
him
immediate
ease
tristram
after
the
tournament
kept
retired
in
his
tent
but
arthur
with
the
consent
of
all
the
knights
of
the
round
table
decreed
him
the
honors
of
the
second
day
but
it
was
no
longer
a
secret
that
the
victor
of
the
two
days
was
the
same
individual
and
gouvernail
being
questioned
confirmed
the
suspicions
of
launcelot
and
arthur
that
it
was
no
other
than
sir
tristram
of
leonais
the
nephew
of
the
king
of
cornwall
king
arthur
who
desired
to
reward
his
distinguished
valor
and
knew
that
his
uncle
mark
had
ungratefully
banished
him
would
have
eagerly
availed
himself
of
the
opportunity
to
attach
tristram
to
his
court
all
the
knights
of
the
round
table
declaring
with
acclamation
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
find
a
more
worthy
companion
but
tristram
had
already
departed
in
search
of
adventures
and
the
damsel
of
queen
isoude
returned
to
her
mistress
chapter
xiv
sir
tristram
battle
with
sir
launcelot
sir
tristram
rode
through
a
forest
and
saw
ten
men
fighting
and
one
man
did
battle
against
nine
so
he
rode
to
the
knights
and
cried
to
them
bidding
them
cease
their
battle
for
they
did
themselves
great
shame
so
many
knights
to
fight
against
one
then
answered
the
master
of
the
knights
his
name
was
sir
breuse
sans
pitie
who
was
at
that
time
the
most
villanous
knight
living
sir
knight
what
have
ye
to
do
to
meddle
with
us
if
ye
be
wise
depart
on
your
way
as
you
came
for
this
knight
shall
not
escape
us
that
were
pity
said
sir
tristram
that
so
good
a
knight
should
be
slain
so
cowardly
therefore
i
warn
you
i
will
succor
him
with
all
my
puissance
then
sir
tristram
alighted
off
his
horse
because
they
were
on
foot
that
they
should
not
slay
his
horse
and
he
smote
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
so
vigorously
that
at
every
stroke
he
struck
down
a
knight
at
last
they
fled
with
breuse
sans
pitie
into
the
tower
and
shut
sir
tristram
without
the
gate
then
sir
tristram
returned
back
to
the
rescued
knight
and
found
him
sitting
under
a
tree
sore
wounded
fair
knight
said
he
how
is
it
with
you
sir
knight
said
sir
palamedes
for

it
was
i

of
your
great
goodness
for

from
death

sir

said

name

sir

that

in
the
world
that

name
said
sir
palamedes
my
name
is
sir
tristram
your
mortal
enemy
it
may
be
so
said
sir
palamedes
but
you
have
done
overmuch
for
me
this
day
that
i
should
fight
with
you
moreover
it
will
be
no
honor
for
you
to
have
to
do
with
me
for
you
are
fresh
and
i
am
wounded
therefore
if
you
will
needs
have
to
do
with
me
assign
me
a
day
and
i
shall
meet
you
without
fail
you
say
well
said
sir
tristram
now
i
assign
you
to
meet
me
in
the
meadow
by
the
river
of
camelot
where
merlin
set
the
monument
so
they
were
agreed
then
they
departed
and
took
their
ways
diverse
sir
tristram
passed
through
a
great
forest
into
a
plain
till
he
came
to
a
priory
and
there
he
reposed
him
with
a
good
man
six
days
then
departed
sir
tristram
and
rode
straight
into
camelot
to
the
monument
of
merlin
and
there
he
looked
about
him
for
sir
palamedes
and
he
perceived
a
seemly
knight
who
came
riding
against
him
all
in
white
with
a
covered
shield
when
he
came
nigh
sir
tristram
said
aloud
welcome
sir
knight
and
well
and
truly
have
you
kept
your
promise
then
they
made
ready
their
shields
and
spears
and
came
together
with
all
the
might
of
their
horses
so
fiercely
that
both
the
horses
and
the
knights
fell
to
the
earth
and
as
soon
as
they
might
they
quitted
their
horses
and
struck
together
with
bright
swords
as
men
of
might
and
each
wounded
the
other
wonderfully
sore
so
that
the
blood
ran
out
upon
the
grass
thus
they
fought
for
the
space
of
four
hours
and
never
one
would
speak
to
the
other
one
word
then
at
last
spake
the
white
knight
and
said
sir
thou
fightest
wonderful
well
as
ever
i
saw
knight
therefore
if
it
please
you
tell
me
your
name
why
dost
thou
ask
my
name
said
sir
tristram
art
thou
not
sir
palamedes
no

the
round
table
the
famous
enchanter
merlin
had
exerted
all
his
skill
in
fabricating
the
round
table
of
the
seats
which
surrounded
it
he
had
constructed
thirteen
in
memory
of
the
thirteen
apostles
twelve
of
these
seats
only
could
be
occupied
and
they
only
by
knights
of
the
highest
fame
the
thirteenth
represented
the
seat
of
the
traitor
judas
it
remained
always
empty
it
was
called
the
perilous
seat
ever
since
a
rash
and
haughty
saracen
knight
had
dared
to
place
himself
in
it
when
the
earth
opened
and
swallowed
him
up
in
our
great
hall
there
stood
a
vacant
chair
fashion
by
merlin
ere
he
past
away
and
carven
with
strange
figures
and
in
and
out
the
figures
like
a
serpent
ran
a
scroll
of
letters
in
a
tongue
no
man
could
read
and
merlin
call
it
siege
perilous
perilous
for
good
and
ill
there
he
said
man
could
sit
but
he
should
lose
himself
the
holy
grail
a
magic
power
wrote
upon
each
seat
the
name
of
the
knight
who
was
entitled
to
sit
in
it
no
one
could
succeed
to
a
vacant
seat
unless
he
surpassed
in
valor
and
glorious
deeds
the
knight
who
had
occupied
it
before
him
without
this
qualification
he
would
be
violently
repelled
by
a
hidden
force
thus
proof
was
made
of
all
those
who
presented
themselves
to
replace
any
companions
of
the
order
who
had
fallen
one
of
the
principal
seats
that
of
moraunt
of
ireland
had
been
vacant
ten
years
and
his
name
still
remained
over
it
ever
since
the
time
when
that
distinguished
champion
fell
beneath
the
sword
of
sir
tristram
arthur
now
took
tristram
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
that
seat
immediately
the
most
melodious
sounds
were
heard
and
exquisite
perfumes
filled
the
place
the
name
of
moraunt
disappeared
and
that
of
tristram
blazed
forth
in
light
the
rare
modesty
of
tristram
had
now
to
be
subjected
to
a
severe
task
for
the
clerks
charged
with
the
duty
of
preserving
the
annals
of
the
round
table
attended
and
he
was
required
by
the
law
of
his
order
to
declare
what
feats
of
arms
he
had
accomplished
to
entitle
him
to
take
that
seat
this
ceremony
being
ended
tristram
received
the
congratulations
of
all
his
companions
sir
launcelot
and
guenever
took
the
occasion
to
speak
to
him
of
the
fair
isoude
and
to
express
their
wish
that
some
happy
chance
might
bring
her
to
the
kingdom
of
loegria
while
tristram
was
thus
honored
and
caressed
at
the
court
of
king
arthur
the
most
gloomy
and
malignant
jealousy
harassed
the
soul
of
mark
he
could
not
look
upon
isoude
without
remembering
that
she
loved
tristram
and
the
good
fortune
of
his
nephew
goaded
him
to
thoughts
of
vengeance
he
at
last
resolved
to
go
disguised
into
the
kingdom
of
loegria
attack
tristram
by
stealth
and
put
him
to
death
he
took
with
him
two
knights
brought
up
in
his
court
who
he
thought
were
devoted
to
him
and
not
willing
to
leave
isoude
behind
named
two
of
her
maidens
to
attend
her
together
with
her
faithful
brengwain
and
made
them
accompany
him
having
arrived
in
the
neighborhood
of
camelot
mark
imparted
his
plan
to
his
two
knights
but
they
rejected
it
with
horror
nay
more
they
declared
that
they
would
no
longer
remain
in
his
service
and
left
him
giving
him
reason
to
suppose
that
they
should
repair
to
the
court
to
accuse
him
before
arthur
it
was
necessary
for
mark
to
meet
and
rebut
their
accusation
so
leaving
isoude
in
an
abbey
he
pursued
his
way
alone
to
camelot
mark
had
not
ridden
far
when
he
encountered
a
party
of
knights
of
arthur
court
and
would
have
avoided
them
for
he
knew
their
habit
of
challenging
to
a
just
every
stranger
knight
whom
they
met
but
it
was
too
late
they
had
seen
his
armor
and
recognized
him
as
a
cornish
knight
and
at
once
resolved
to
have
some
sport
with
him
it
happened
they
had
with
them
daguenet
king
fool
who
though
deformed
and
weak
of
body
was
not
wanting
in
courage
the
knights
as
mark
approached
laid
their
plan
that
daguenet
should
personate
sir
launcelot
of
the
lake
and
challenge
the
cornish
knight
they
equipped
him
in
armor
belonging
to
one
of
their
number
who
was
ill
and
sent
him
forward
to
the
to
defy
the
strange
knight
mark
who
saw
that
his
antagonist
was
by
no
means
formidable
in
appearance
was
not
disinclined
to
the
combat
but
when
the
dwarf
rode
towards
him
calling
out
that
he
was
sir
launcelot
of
the
lake
his
fears
prevailed
he
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
rode
away
at
full
speed
pursued
by
the
shouts
and
laughter
of
the
party
meanwhile
isoude
remaining
at
the
abbey
with
her
faithful
brengwain
found
her
only
amusement
in
walking
occasionally
in
a
forest
adjoining
the
abbey
there
on
the
brink
of
a
fountain
girdled
with
trees
she
thought
of
her
love
and
sometimes
joined
her
voice
and
her
harp
in
lays
reviving
the
memory
of
its
pains
or
pleasures
one
day
the
caitiff
knight
breuse
the
pitiless
heard
her
voice
concealed
himself
and
drew
near
she
sang
sweet
silence
shadowy
bower
and
verdant
lair
ye
court
my
troubled
spirit
to
repose
whilst
i
such
dear
remembrance
rises
there
awaken
every
echo
with
my
woes
within
these
woods
by
nature
hand
arrayed
a
fountain
springs
and
feeds
a
thousand
flowers
ah
how
my
groans
do
all
its
murmurs
aid
how
my
sad
eyes
do
swell
it
with
their
showers
what
doth
my
knight
the
while
to
him
is
given
a
double
meed
in
love
and
arms
emprise
him
the
round
table
elevates
to
heaven
tristram
ah
me
he
hears
not
isoude
cries
breuse
the
pitiless
who
like
most
other
caitiffs
had
felt
the
weight
of
tristram
arm
and
hated
him
accordingly
at
hearing
his
name
breathed
forth
by
the
beautiful
songstress
impelled
by
a
double
impulse
rushed
forth
from
his
concealment
and
laid
hands
on
his
victim
isoude
fainted
and
brengwain
filled
the
air
with
her
shrieks
breuse
carried
isoude
to
the
place
where
he
had
left
his
horse
but
the
animal
had
got
away
from
his
bridle
and
was
at
some
distance
he
was
obliged
to
lay
down
his
fair
burden
and
go
in
pursuit
of
his
horse
just
then
a
knight
came
up
drawn
by
the
cries
of
brengwain
and
demanded
the
cause
of
her
distress
she
could
not
speak
but
pointed
to
her
mistress
lying
insensible
on
the
ground
breuse
had
by
this
time
returned
and
the
cries
of
brengwain
renewed
at
seeing
him
sufficiently
showed
the
stranger
the
cause
of
the
distress
tristram
spurred
his
horse
towards
breuse
who
not
unprepared
ran
to
the
encounter
breuse
was
unhorsed
and
lay
motionless
pretending
to
be
dead
but
when
the
stranger
knight
left
him
to
attend
to
the
distressed
damsels
he
mounted
his
horse
and
made
his
escape
the
knight
now
approached
isoude
gently
raised
her
head
drew
aside
the
golden
hair
which
covered
her
countenance
gazed
thereon
for
an
instant
uttered
a
cry
and
fell
back
insensible
brengwain
came
her
cares
soon
restored
her
mistress
to
life
and
they
then
turned
their
attention
to
the
fallen
warrior
they
raised
his
visor
and
discovered
the
countenance
of
sir
tristram
isoude
threw
herself
on
the
body
of
her
lover
and
bedewed
his
face
with
her
tears
their
warmth
revived
the
knight
and
tristram
on
awaking
found
himself
in
the
arms
of
his
dear
isoude
it
was
the
law
of
the
round
table
that
each
knight
after
his
admission
should
pass
the
next
ten
days
in
quest
of
adventures
during
which
time
his
companions
might
meet
him
in
disguised
armor
and
try
their
strength
with
him
tristram
had
now
been
out
seven
days
and
in
that
time
had
encountered
many
of
the
best
knights
of
the
round
table
and
acquitted
himself
with
honor
during
the
remaining
three
days
isoude
remained
at
the
abbey
under
his
protection
and
then
set
out
with
her
maidens
escorted
by
sir
tristram
to
rejoin
king
mark
at
the
court
of
camelot
this
happy
journey
was
one
of
the
brightest
epochs
in
the
lives
of
tristram
and
isoude
he
celebrated
it
by
a
lay
upon
the
harp
in
a
peculiar
measure
to
which
the
french
give
the
name
of

chapter
xvi
sir
palamedes
while
sir
tristram
and
the
fair
isoude
abode
yet
at
la
joyeuse
garde
sir
tristram
rode
forth
one
day
without
armor
having
no
weapon
but
his
spear
and
his
sword
and
as
he
rode
he
came
to
a
place
where
he
saw
two
knights
in
battle
and
one
of
them
had
gotten
the
better
and
the
other
lay
overthrown
the
knight
who
had
the
better
was
sir
palamedes
when
sir
palamedes
knew
sir
tristram
he
cried
out
sir
tristram
now
we
be
met
and
ere
we
depart
we
will
redress
our
old
wrongs
as
for
that
said
sir
tristram
there
never
yet
was
christian
man
that
might
make
his
boast
that
i
ever
fled
from
him
and
thou
that
art
a
saracen
shalt
never
say
that
of
me
and
therewith
sir
tristram
made
his
horse
to
run
and
with
all
his
might
came
straight
upon
sir
palamedes
and
broke
his
spear
upon
him
then
he
drew
his
sword
and
struck
at
sir
palamedes
six
great
strokes
upon
his
helm
sir
palamedes
saw
that
sir
tristram
had
not
his
armor
on
and
he
marvelled
at
his
rashness
and
his
great
folly
and
said
to
himself
if
i
meet
and
slay
him
i
am
shamed
wheresoever
i
go
then
sir
tristram
cried
out
and
said
thou
coward
knight
why
wilt
thou
not
do
battle
with
me
for
have
thou
no
doubt
i
shall
endure
all
thy
malice
ah
sir
tristram
said
sir
palamedes
thou
knowest
i
may
not
fight
with
thee
for
shame
for
thou
art
here
naked
and
i
am
armed
now
i
require
that
thou
answer
me
a
question
that
i
shall
ask
you
tell
me
what
it
is
said
sir
tristram
i
put
the
case
said
palamedes
that
you
were
well
armed
and
i
naked
as
ye
be
what
would
you
do
to
me
now
by
your
true
knighthood
ah
said
sir
tristram
now
i
understand
thee
well
sir
palamedes
and
as
god
bless
me
what
i
shall
say
shall
not
be
said
for
fear
that
i
have
of
thee
but
if
it
were
so
thou
shouldest
depart
from
me
for
i
would
not
have
to
do
with
thee
no
more
will
i
with
thee
said
sir
palamedes
and
therefore
ride
forth
on
thy
way
as
for
that
i
may
choose
said
sir
tristram
either
to
ride
or
to
abide
but
sir
palamedes
i
marvel
at
one
thing
that
thou
art
so
good
a
knight
yet
that
thou
wilt
not
be
christened
as
for
that
said
sir
palamedes
i
may
not
yet
be
christened
for
a
vow
which
i
made
many
years
ago
yet
in
my
heart
i
believe
in
our
saviour
and
his
mild
mother
mary
but
i
have
yet
one
battle
to
do
and
when
that
is
done
i
will
be
christened
with
a
good
will
by
my
head
said
sir
tristram
as
for
that
one
battle
thou
shalt
seek
it
no
longer
for
yonder
is
a
knight
whom
you
have
smitten
down
now
help
me
to
be
clothed
in
his
armor
and
i
will
soon
fulfil
thy
vow
as
ye
will
said
sir
palamedes
so
shall
it
be
so
they
rode
both
unto
that
knight
that
sat
on
a
bank
and
sir
tristram
saluted
him
and
he
full
weary
saluted
him
again
sir
said
sir
tristram
i
pray
you
to
lend
me
your
whole
armor
for
i
am
unarmed
and
i
must
do
battle
with
this
knight
sir
said
the
hurt
knight
you
shall
have
it
with
a
right
good
will
then
sir
tristram
unarmed
sir
galleron
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
hurt
knight
and
he
as
well
as
he
could
helped
to
arm
sir
tristram
then
sir
tristram
mounted
upon
his
own
horse
and
in
his
hand
he
took
sir
spear
thereupon
sir
palamedes
was
ready
and
so
they
came
hurling
together
and
each
smote
the
other
in
the
midst
of
their
shields
sir
palamedes
spear
broke
and
sir
tristram
smote
down
the
horse
then
sir
palamedes
leapt
from
his
horse
and
drew
out
his
sword
that
saw
sir
tristram
and
therewith
he
alighted
and
tied
his
horse
to
a
tree
then
they
came
together
as
two
wild
beasts
lashing
the
one
on
the
other
and
so
fought
more
than
two
hours
and
often
sir
tristram
smote
such
strokes
at
sir
palamedes
that
he
made
him
to
kneel
and
sir
palamedes
broke
away
sir
shield
and
wounded
him
then
sir
tristram
was
wroth
out
of
measure
and
he
rushed
to
sir
palamedes
and
wounded
him
passing
sore
through
the
shoulder
and
by
fortune
smote
sir
sword
out
of
his
hand
and
if
sir
palamedes
had
stooped
for
his
sword
sir
tristram
had
slain
him
then
sir
palamedes
stood
and
beheld
his
sword
with
a
full
sorrowful
heart
now
said
sir
tristram
i
have
thee
at
a
vantage
as
thou
hadst
me
but
it
shall
never
be
said
in
court
or
among
good
knights
that
sir
tristram
did
slay
any
knight
that
was
weaponless
therefore
take
thou
thy
sword
and
let
us
fight
this
battle
to
the
end
then
spoke
sir
palamedes
to
sir
tristram
i
have
no
wish
to
fight
this
battle
any
more
the
offence
that
i
have
done
unto
you
is
not
so
great
but
that
if
it
please
you
we
may
be
friends
all
that
i
have
offended
is
for
the
love
of
the
queen
la
belle
isoude
and
i
dare
maintain
that
she
is
peerless
among
ladies
and
for
that
offence
ye
have
given
me
many
grievous
and
sad
strokes
and
some
i
have
given
you
again
wherefore
i
require
you
my
lord
sir
tristram
forgive
me
all
that
i
have
offended
you
and
this
day
have
me
unto
the
next
church
and
first
i
will
be
clean
confessed
and
after
that
see
you
that
i
be
truly
baptized
and
then
we
will
ride
together
unto
the
court
of
my
lord
king
arthur
so
that
we
may
be
there
at
the
feast
of
pentecost
now
take
your
horse
said
sir
tristram
and
as
you
have
said
so
shall
it
be
done
so
they
took
their
horses
and
sir
galleron
rode
with
them
when
they
came
to
the
church
of
carlisle
the
bishop
commanded
to
fill
a
great
vessel
with
water
and
when
he
had
hallowed
it
he
then
confessed
sir
palamedes
clean
and
christened
him
and
sir
tristram
and
sir
galleron
were
his
godfathers
then
soon
after
they
departed
and
rode
towards
camelot
where
the
noble
king
arthur
and
queen
guenever
were
keeping
a
court
royal
and
the
king
and
all
the
court
were
glad
that
sir
palamedes
was
christened
then
sir
tristram
returned
again
to
la
joyeuse
garde
and
sir
palamedes
went
his
way
not
long
after
these
events
sir
gawain
returned
from
brittany
and
related
to
king
arthur
the
adventure
which
befell
him
in
the
forest
of
breciliande
how
merlin
had
there
spoken
to
him
and
enjoined
him
to
charge
the
king
to
go
without
delay
upon
the
quest
of
the
holy
greal
while
king
arthur
deliberated
tristram
determined
to
enter
upon
the
quest
and
the
more
readily
as
it
was
well
known
to
him
that
this
holy
adventure
would
if
achieved
procure
him
the
pardon
of
all
his
sins
he
immediately
departed
for
the
kingdom
of
brittany
hoping
there
to
obtain
from
merlin
counsel
as
to
the
proper
course
to
pursue
to
insure
success
chapter
xvii
sir
tristram
on
arriving
in
brittany
tristram
found
king
hoel
engaged
in
a
war
with
a
rebellious
vassal
and
hard
pressed
by
his
enemy
his
best
knights
had
fallen
in
a
late
battle
and
he
knew
not
where
to
turn
for
assistance
tristram
volunteered
his
aid
it
was
accepted
and
the
army
of
hoel
led
by
tristram
and
inspired
by
his
example
gained
a
complete
victory
the
king
penetrated
by
the
most
lively
sentiments
of
gratitude
and
having
informed
himself
of
birth
offered
him
his
daughter
in
marriage
the
princess
was
beautiful
and
accomplished
and
bore
the
same
name
with
the
queen
of
cornwall
but
this
one
is
designated
by
the
romancers
as
isoude
of
the
white
hands
to
distinguish
her
from
isoude
the
fair
how
can
we
describe
the
conflict
that
agitated
the
heart
of
tristram
he
adored
the
first
isoude
but
his
love
for
her
was
hopeless
and
not
unaccompanied
by
remorse
moreover
the
sacred
quest
on
which
he
had
now
entered
demanded
of
him
perfect
purity
of
life
it
seemed
as
if
a
happy
destiny
had
provided
for
him
in
the
charming
princess
isoude
of
the
white
hands
the
best
security
for
all
his
good
resolutions
this
last
reflection
determined
him
they
were
married
and
passed
some
months
in
tranquil
happiness
at
the
court
of
king
hoel
the
pleasure
which
tristram
felt
in
his
wife
society
increased
day
by
day
an
inward
grace
seemed
to
stir
within
him
from
the
moment
when
he
took
the
oath
to
go
on
the
quest
of
the
holy
greal
it
seemed
even
to
triumph
over
the
power
of
the
magic
the
war
which
had
been
quelled
for
a
time
now
burst
out
anew
tristram
as
usual
was
foremost
in
every
danger
the
enemy
was
worsted
in
successive
conflicts
and
at
last
shut
himself
up
in
his
principal
city
tristram
led
on
the
attack
of
the
city
as
he
mounted
a
ladder
to
scale
the
walls
he
was
struck
on
the
head
by
a
fragment
of
rock
which
the
besieged
threw
down
upon
him
it
bore
him
to
the
ground
where
he
lay
insensible
as
soon
as
he
recovered
consciousness
he
demanded
to
be
carried
to
his
wife
the
princess
skilled
in
the
art
of
surgery
would
not
suffer
any
one
but
herself
to
touch
her
beloved
husband
her
fair
hands
bound
up
his
wounds
tristram
kissed
them
with
gratitude
which
began
to
grow
into
love
at
first
the
devoted
cares
of
isoude
seemed
to
meet
with
great
success
but
after
a
while
these
flattering
appearances
vanished
and
in
spite
of
all
her
care
the
malady
grew
more
serious
day
by
day
in
this
perplexity
an
old
squire
of
tristram
reminded
his
master
that
the
princess
of
ireland
afterwards
queen
of
cornwall
had
once
cured
him
under
circumstances
quite
as
discouraging
he
called
isoude
of
the
white
hands
to
him
told
her
of
his
former
cure
added
that
he
believed
that
the
queen
isoude
could
heal
him
and
that
he
felt
sure
that
she
would
come
to
his
relief
if
sent
for
isoude
of
the
white
hands
consented
that
gesnes
a
trusty
man
and
skilful
navigator
should
be
sent
to
cornwall
tristram
called
him
and
giving
him
a
ring
take
this
he
said
to
the
queen
of
cornwall
tell
her
that
tristram
near
to
death
demands
her
aid
if
you
succeed
in
bringing
her
with
you
place
white
sails
to
your
vessel
on
your
return
that
we
may
know
of
your
success
when
the
vessel
first
heaves
in
sight
but
if
queen
isoude
refuses
put
on
black
sails
they
will
be
the
presage
of
my
impending
death
gesnes
performed
his
mission
successfully
king
mark
happened
to
be
absent
from
his
capital
and
the
queen
readily
consented
to
return
with
the
bark
to
brittany
gesnes
clothed
his
vessel
in
the
whitest
of
sails
and
sped
his
way
back
to
brittany
meantime
the
wound
of
tristram
grew
more
desperate
day
by
day
his
strength
quite
prostrated
no
longer
permitted
him
to
be
carried
to
the
seaside
daily
as
had
been
his
custom
from
the
first
moment
when
it
was
possible
for
the
bark
to
be
on
the
way
homeward
he
called
a
young
damsel
and
gave
her
in
charge
to
keep
watch
in
the
direction
of
cornwall
and
to
come
and
tell
him
the
color
of
the
sails
of
the
first
vessel
she
should
see
approaching
when
isoude
of
the
white
hands
consented
that
the
queen
of
cornwall
should
be
sent
for
she
had
not
known
all
the
reasons
which
she
had
for
fearing
the
influence
which
renewed
intercourse
with
that
princess
might
have
on
her
own
happiness
she
had
now
learned
more
and
felt
the
danger
more
keenly
she
thought
if
she
could
only
keep
the
knowledge
of
the
queen
arrival
from
her
husband
she
might
employ
in
his
service
any
resources
which
her
skill
could
supply
and
still
avert
the
dangers
which
she
apprehended
when
the
vessel
was
seen
approaching
with
its
white
sails
sparkling
in
the
sun
the
damsel
by
command
of
her
mistress
carried
word
to
tristram
that
the
sails
were
black
tristram
penetrated
with
inexpressible
grief
breathed
a
profound
sigh
turned
away
his
face
and
said
alas
my
beloved
we
shall
never
see
one
another
again
then
he
commended
himself
to
god
and
breathed
his
last
the
death
of
tristram
was
the
first
intelligence
which
the
queen
of
cornwall
heard
on
landing
she
was
conducted
almost
senseless
into
the
chamber
of
tristram
and
expired
holding
him
in
her
arms
tristram
before
his
death
had
requested
that
his
body
should
be
sent
to
cornwall
and
that
his
sword
with
a
letter
he
had
written
should
be
delivered
to
king
mark
the
remains
of
tristram
and
isoude
were
embarked
in
a
vessel
along
with
the
sword
which
was
presented
to
the
king
of
cornwall
he
was
melted
with
tenderness
when
he
saw
the
weapon
which
slew
moraunt
of
ireland
which
had
so
often
saved
his
life
and
redeemed
the
honor
of
his
kingdom
in
the
letter
tristram
begged
pardon
of
his
uncle
and
related
the
story
of
the
amorous
draught
mark
ordered
the
lovers
to
be
buried
in
his
own
chapel
from
the
tomb
of
tristram
there
sprung
a
vine
which
went
along
the
walls
and
descended
into
the
grave
of
the
queen
it
was
cut
down
three
times
but
each
time
sprung
up

than
before

perceval
the
father
and
two
elder
brothers
of
perceval
had
fallen
in
battle
or
tournaments
and
hence
as
the
last
hope
of
his
family
his
mother
retired
with
him
into
a
solitary
region
where
he
was
brought
up
in
total
ignorance
of
arms
and
chivalry
he
was
allowed
no
weapon
but
a
lyttel
scots
spere
which
was
the
only
thing
of
all
her
lordes
faire
gere
that
his
mother
carried
to
the
wood
with
her
in
the
use
of
this
he
became
so
skilful
that
he
could
kill
with
it
not
only
the
animals
of
the
chase
for
the
table
but
even
birds
on
the
wing
at
length
however
perceval
was
roused
to
a
desire
of
military
renown
by
seeing
in
the
forest
five
knights
who
were
in
complete
armor
he
said
to
his
mother
mother
what
are
those
yonder
they
are
angels
my
son
said
she
by
my
faith
i
will
go
and
become
an
angel
with
them
and
perceval
went
to
the
road
and
met
them
tell
me
good
lad
said
one
of
them
sawest
thou
a
knight
pass
this
way
either
today
or
yesterday
i
know
not
said
he
what
a
knight
is
such
an
one
as
i
am
said
the
knight
if
thou
wilt
tell
me
what
i
ask
thee
i
will
tell
thee
what
thou
askest
me
gladly
will
i
do
so
said
sir
owain
for
that
was
the
knight
name
what
is
this
demanded
perceval
touching
the
saddle
it
is
a
saddle
said
owain
then
he
asked
about
all
the
accoutrements
which
he
saw
upon
the
men
and
the
horses
and
about
the
arms
and
what
they
were
for
and
how
they
were
used
and
sir
owain
showed
him
all
those
things
fully
and
perceval
in
return
gave
him
such
information
as
he
had
then
perceval
returned
to
his
mother
and
said
to
her
mother
those
were
not
angels
but
honorable
knights
then
his
mother
swooned
away
and
perceval
went
to
the
place
where
they
kept
the
horses
that
carried
firewood
and
provisions
for
the
castle
and
he
took
a
bony
piebald
horse
which
seemed
to
him
the
strongest
of
them
and
he
pressed
a
pack
into
the
form
of
a
saddle
and
with
twisted
twigs
he
imitated
the
trappings
which
he
had
seen
upon
the
horses
when
he
came
again
to
his
mother
the
countess
had
recovered
from
her
swoon
my
son
said
she
desirest
thou
to
ride
forth
yes
with
thy
leave
said
he
go
forward
then
she
said
to
the
court
of
arthur
where
there
are
the
best
and
the
noblest
and
the
most
bountiful
of
men
and
tell
him
thou
art
perceval
the
son
of
pelenore
and
ask
of
him
to
bestow
knighthood
on
thee
and
whenever
thou
seest
a
church
repeat
there
thy
noster
and
if
thou
see
meat
and
drink
and
hast
need
of
them
thou
mayest
take
them
if
thou
hear
an
outcry
of
one
in
distress
proceed
toward
it
especially
if
it
be
the
cry
of
a
woman
and
render
her
what
service
thou
canst
if
thou
see
a
fair

win
it
for
thus
shalt
thou
acquire
fame
yet
freely
give
it
to

for
thus
thou
shalt
obtain
praise
if
thou
see
a
fair
woman
pay
court
to
her
for
thus
thou
wilt
obtain

after
this
discourse
perceval
mounted
the
horse
and
taking
a
number
of
sticks
in
his
hand
he
rode
forth
and
he
rode
far
in
the
woody
wilderness
without
food
or
drink
at
last
he
came
to
an
opening
in
the
wood
where
he
saw
a
tent
and
as
he
thought
it
might
be
a
church
he
said
his
to
it
and
he
went
towards
it
and
the
door
of
the
tent
was
open
and
perceval
dismounted
and
entered
the
tent
in
the
tent
he
found
a
maiden
sitting
with
a
golden
frontlet
on
her
forehead
and
a
gold
ring
on
her
hand
and
perceval
said
maiden
i
salute
you
for
my
mother
told
me
whenever
i
met
a
lady
i
must
respectfully
salute
her
perceiving
in
one
corner
of
the
tent
some
food
two
flasks
full
of
wine
and
some
boar
flesh
roasted
he
said
my
mother
told
me
whenever
i
saw
meat
and
drink
to
take
it
and
he
ate
greedily
for
he
was
very
hungry
the
maiden
said
sir
thou
hadst
best
go
quickly
from
here
for
fear
that
my
friends
should
come
and
evil
should
befall
you
but
perceval
said
my
mother
told
me
wheresoever
i
saw
a
fair
jewel
to
take
it
and
he
took
the
gold
ring
from
her
finger
and
put
it
on
his
own
and
he
gave
the
maiden
his
own
ring
in
exchange
for
hers
then
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
perceval
journeyed
on
till
he
arrived
at
arthur
court
and
it
so
happened
that
just
at
that
time
an
uncourteous
knight
had
offered
queen
guenever
a
gross
insult
for
when
her
page
was
serving
the
queen
with
a
golden
goblet
this
knight
struck
the
arm
of
the
page
and
dashed
the
wine
in
the
queen
face
and
over
her
stomacher
then
he
said
if
any
have
boldness
to
avenge
this
insult
to
guenever
let
him
follow
me
to
the
meadow
so
the
knight
took
his
horse
and
rode
to
the
meadow
carrying
away
the
golden
goblet
and
all
the
household
hung
down
their
heads
and
no
one
offered
to
follow
the
knight
to
take
vengeance
upon
him
for
it
seemed
to
them
that
no
one
would
have
ventured
on
so
daring
an
outrage
unless
he
possessed
such
powers
through
magic
or
charms
that
none
could
be
able
to
punish
him
just
then
behold
perceval
entered
the
hall
upon
the
bony
piebald
horse
with
his
uncouth
trappings
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
stood
kay
the
seneschal
tell
me
tall
man
said
perceval
is
that
arthur
yonder
what
wouldst
thou
with
arthur
asked
kay
my
mother
told
me
to
go
to
arthur
and
receive
knighthood
from
him
by
my
faith
said
he
thou
art
all
too
meanly
equipped
with
horse
and
with
arms
then
all
the
household
began
to
jeer
and
laugh
at
him
but
there
was
a
certain
damsel
who
had
been
a
whole
year
at
arthur
court
and
had
never
been
known
to
smile
and
the
king
fool
footnote
a
fool
was
a
common
appendage
of
the
courts
of
those
days
when
this
romance
was
written
a
fool
was
the
ornament
held
in
next
estimation
to
a
dwarf
he
wore
a
white
dress
with
a
yellow
bonnet
and
carried
a
bell
or
bawble
in
his
hand
though
called
a
fool
his
words
were
often
weighed
and
remembered
as
if
there
were
a
sort
of
oracular
meaning
in
them
had
said
that
this
damsel
would
not
smile
till
she
had
seen
him
who
would
be
the
flower
of
chivalry
now
this
damsel
came
up
to
perceval
and
told
him
smiling
that
if
he
lived
he
would
be
one
of
the
bravest
and
best
of
knights
truly
said
kay
thou
art
ill
taught
to
remain
a
year
at
arthur
court
with
choice
of
society
and
smile
on
no
one
and
now
before
the
face
of
arthur
and
all
his
knights
to
call
such
a
man
as
this
the
flower
of
knighthood
and
he
gave
her
a
box
on
the
ear
that
she
fell
senseless
to
the
ground
then
said
kay
to
perceval
go
after
the
knight
who
went
hence
to
the
meadow
overthrow
him
and
recover
the
golden
goblet
and
possess
thyself
of
his
horse
and
arms
and
thou
shalt
have
knighthood
i
will
do
so
tall
man
said
perceval
so
he
turned
his
head
toward
the
meadow
and
when
he
came
there
the
knight
was
riding
up
and
down
proud
of
his
strength
and
valor
and
noble
mien
tell
me
said
the
knight
didst
thou
see
any
one
coming
after
me
from
the
court
the
tall
man
that
was
there
said
perceval
told
me
to
come
and
overthrow
thee
and
to
take
from
thee
the
goblet
and
thy
horse
and
armor
for
myself
silence
said
the
knight
go
back
to
the
court
and
tell
arthur
either
to
come
himself
or
to
send
some
other
to
fight
with
me
and
unless
he
do
so
quickly
i
will
not
wait
for
him
by
my
faith
said
perceval
choose
thou
whether
it
shall
be
willingly
or
unwillingly
for
i
will
have
the
horse
and
the
arms
and
the
goblet
upon
this
the
knight
ran
at
him
furiously
and
struck
him
a
violent
blow
with
the
shaft
of
his
spear
between
the
neck
and
the
shoulder
ha
ha
lad
said
perceval
my
mother
servants
were
not
used
to
play
with
me
in
this
wise
so
thus
will
i
play
with
thee
and
he
threw
at
him
one
of
his
sticks
and
it
struck
him
in
the
eye
and
came
out
at
the
back
of
his
head
so
that
he
fell
down
lifeless
verily
said
sir
owain
the
son
of
urien
to
kay
the
seneschal
thou
wast
to
send
that
madman
after
the
knight
for
he
must
either
be
overthrown
or
flee
and
either
way
it
will
be
a
disgrace
to
arthur
and
his
warriors
therefore
will
i
go
to
see
what
has
befallen
him
so
sir
owain
went
to
the
meadow
and
he
found
perceval
trying
in
vain
to
get
the
dead
knight
armor
off
in
order
to
clothe
himself
with
it
sir
owain
unfastened
the
armor
and
helped
perceval
to
put
it
on
and
taught
him
how
to
put
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
and
use
the
spur
for
perceval
had
never
used
stirrup
nor
spur
but
rode
without
saddle
and
urged
on
his
horse
with
a
stick
then
owain
would
have
had
him
return
to
the
court
to
receive
the
praise
that
was
his
due
but
perceval
said
i
will
not
come
to
the
court
till
i
have
encountered
the
tall
man
that
is
there
to
revenge
the
injury
he
did
to
the
maiden
but
take
thou
the
goblet
to
queen
guenever
and
tell
king
arthur
that
wherever
i
am
i
will
be
his
vassal
and
will
do
him
what
profit
and
service
i
can
and
sir
owain
went
back
to
the
court
and
related
all
these
things
to
arthur
and
guenever
and
to
all
the
household
and
perceval
rode
forward
and
he
came
to
a
lake
on
the
side
of
which
was
a
fair
castle
and
on
the
border
of
the
lake
he
saw
a
man
sitting
upon
a
velvet
cushion
and
his
attendants
were
fishing
in
the
lake
when
the
man
beheld
perceval
approaching
he
arose
and
went
into
the
castle
perceval
rode
to
the
castle
and
the
door
was
open
and
he
entered
the
hall
and
the
man
received
perceval
courteously
and
asked
him
to
sit
by
him
on
the
cushion
when
it
was
time
the
tables
were
set
and
they
went
to
meat
and
when
they
had
finished
their
meat
the
man
asked
perceval
if
he
knew
how
to
fight
with
the
sword
i
know
not
said
perceval
but
were
i
to
be
taught
doubtless
i
should
and
the
man
said
to
him
i
am
thy
uncle
thy
mother
brother
i
am
called
king
pecheur
footnote
the
word
means
both
fisher
and
sinner
thou
shalt
remain
with
me
a
space
in
order
to
learn
the
manners
and
customs
of
different
countries
and
courtesy
and
noble
bearing
and
this
do
thou
remember
if
thou
seest
aught
to
cause
thy
wonder
ask
not
the
meaning
of
it
if
no
one
has
the
courtesy
to
inform
thee
the
reproach
will
not
fall
upon
thee
but
upon
me
that
am
thy
teacher
while
perceval
and
his
uncle
discoursed
together
perceval
beheld
two
youths
enter
the
hall
bearing
a
golden
cup
and
a
spear
of
mighty
size
with
blood
dropping
from
its
point
to
the
ground
and
when
all
the
company
saw
this
they
began
to
weep
and
lament
but
for
all
that
the
man
did
not
break
off
his
discourse
with
perceval
and
as
he
did
not
tell
him
the
meaning
of
what
he
saw
he
forebore
to
ask
him
concerning
it
now
the
cup
that
perceval
saw
was
the
sangreal
and
the
spear
the
sacred
spear
and
afterwards
king
pecheur
removed
with
those
sacred
relics
into
a
far
country
one
evening
perceval
entered
a
valley
and
came
to
a
cell
and
the
hermit
welcomed
him
gladly
and
there
he
spent
the
night
and
in
the
morning
he
arose
and
when
he
went
forth
behold
a
shower
of
snow
had
fallen
in
the
night
and
a
hawk
had
killed
a
in
front
of
the
cell
and
the
noise
of
the
horse
had
scared
the
hawk
away
and
a
raven
alighted
on
the
bird
and
perceval
stood
and
compared
the
blackness
of
the
raven
and
the
whiteness
of
the
snow
and
the
redness
of
the
blood
to
the
hair
of
the
lady
that
best
he
loved
which
was
blacker
than
jet
and
to
her
skin
which
was
whiter
than
the
snow
and
to
the
two
red
spots
upon
her
cheeks
which
were
redder
than
the
blood
upon
the
snow
now
arthur
and
his
household
were
in
search
of
perceval
and
by
chance
they
came
that
way
know
ye
said
arthur
who
is
the
knight
with
the
long
spear
that
stands
by
the
brook
up
yonder
lord
said
one
of
them
i
will
go
and
learn
who
he
is
so
the
youth
came
to
the
place
where
perceval
was
and
asked
him
what
he
did
thus
and
who
he
was
but
perceval
was
so
intent
upon
his
thought
that
he
gave
him
no
answer
then
the
youth
thrust
at
perceval
with
his
lance
and
perceval
turned
upon
him
and
struck
him
to
the
ground
and
when
the
youth
returned
to
the
king
and
told
how
rudely
he
had
been
treated
sir
kay
said
i
will
go
myself
and
when
he
greeted
perceval
and
got
no
answer
he
spoke
to
him
rudely
and
angrily
and
perceval
thrust
at
him
with
his
lance
and
cast
him
down
so
that
he
broke
his
arm
and
his
and
while
he
lay
thus
stunned
his
horse
returned
back
at
a
wild
and
prancing
pace
then
said
sir
gawain
surnamed
the
because
he
was
the
most
courteous
knight
in
arthur
court
it
is
not
fitting
that
any
should
disturb
an
honorable
knight
from
his
thought
unadvisedly
for
either
he
is
pondering
some
damage
that
he
has
sustained
or
he
is
thinking
of
the
lady
whom
best
he
loves
if
it
seem
well
to
thee
lord
i
will
go
and
see
if
this
knight
has
changed
from
his
thought
and
if
he
has
i
will
ask
him
courteously
to
come
and
visit
thee
and
perceval
was
resting
on
the
shaft
of
his
spear
pondering
the
same
thought
and
sir
gawain
came
to
him
and
said
if
i
thought
it
would
be
as
agreeable
to
thee
as
it
would
be
to
me
i
would
converse
with
thee
i
have
also
a
message
from
arthur
unto
thee
to
pray
thee
to
come
and
visit
him
and
two
men
have
been
before
on
this
errand
that
is
true
said
perceval
and
uncourteously
they
came
they
attacked
me
and
i
was
annoyed
thereat
then
he
told
him
the
thought
that
occupied
his
mind
and
gawain
said
this
was
not
an
ungentle
thought
and
i
should
marvel
if
it
were
pleasant
for
thee
to
be
drawn
from
it
then
said
perceval
tell
me
is
sir
kay
in
arthur
court
he
is
said
gawain
and
truly
he
is
the
knight
who
fought
with
thee
last
verily
said
perceval
i
am
not
sorry
to
have
thus
avenged
the
insult
to
the
smiling
maiden
then
perceval
told
him
his
name
and
said
who
art
thou
and
he
replied
i
am
gawain
i
am
right
glad
to
meet
thee
said
perceval
for
i
have
everywhere
heard
of
thy
prowess
and
uprightness
and
i
solicit
thy
fellowship
thou
shalt
have
it
by
my
faith
and
grant
me
thine
said
he
gladly
will
i
do
so
answered
perceval
so
they
went
together
to
arthur
and
saluted
him
behold
lord
said
gawain
him
whom
thou
hast
sought
so
long
welcome
unto
thee
chieftain
said
arthur
and
hereupon
there
came
the
queen
and
her
handmaidens
and
perceval
saluted
them
and
they
were
rejoiced
to
see
him
and
bade
him
welcome
and
arthur
did
him
great
honor
and
respect
and
they
returned
towards
caerleon
chapter
xix
the
sangreal
or
holy
graal
the
sangreal
was
the
cup
from
which
our
saviour
drank
at
his
last
supper
he
was
supposed
to
have
given
it
to
joseph
of
arimathea
who
carried
it
to
europe
together
with
the
spear
with
which
the
soldier
pierced
the
saviour
side
from
generation
to
generation
one
of
the
descendants
of
joseph
of
arimathea
had
been
devoted
to
the
guardianship
of
these
precious
relics
but
on
the
sole
condition
of
leading
a
life
of
purity
in
thought
word
and
deed
for
a
long
time
the
sangreal
was
visible
to
all
pilgrims
and
its
presence
conferred
blessings
upon
the
land
in
which
it
was
preserved
but
at
length
one
of
those
holy
men
to
whom
its
guardianship
had
descended
so
far
forgot
the
obligation
of
his
sacred
office
as
to
look
with
unhallowed
eye
upon
a
young
female
pilgrim
whose
robe
was
accidentally
loosened
as
she
knelt
before
him
the
sacred
lance
instantly
punished
his
frailty
spontaneously
falling
upon
him
and
inflicting
a
deep
wound
the
marvellous
wound
could
by
no
means
be
healed
and
the
guardian
of
the
sangreal
was
ever
after
called
le
roi
pescheur
the
sinner
king
the
sangreal
withdrew
its
visible
presence
from
the
crowds
who
came
to
worship
and
an
iron
age
succeeded
to
the
happiness
which
its
presence
had
diffused
among
the
tribes
of
britain
but
then
the
times
grew
to
such
evil
that
the
holy
cup
was
caught
away
to
heaven
and
disappear
the
holy
grail
we
have
told
in
the
history
of
merlin
how
that
great
prophet
and
enchanter
sent
a
message
to
king
arthur
by
sir
gawain
directing
him
to
undertake
the
recovery
of
the
sangreal
informing
him
at
the
same
time
that
the
knight
who
should
accomplish
that
sacred
quest
was
already
born
and
of
a
suitable
age
to
enter
upon
it
sir
gawain
delivered
his
message
and
the
king
was
anxiously
revolving
in
his
mind
how
best
to
achieve
the
enterprise
when
at
the
vigil
of
pentecost
all
the
fellowship
of
the
round
table
being
met
together
at
camelot
as
they
sat
at
meat
suddenly
there
was
heard
a
clap
of
thunder
and
then
a
bright
light
burst
forth
and
every
knight
as
he
looked
on
his
fellow
saw
him
in
seeming
fairer
than
ever
before
all
the
hall
was
filled
with
sweet
odors
and
every
knight
had
such
meat
and
drink
as
he
best
loved
then
there
entered
into
the
hall
the
holy
graal
covered
with
white
samite
so
that
none
could
see
it
and
it
passed
through
the
hall
suddenly
and
disappeared
during
this
time
no
one
spoke
a
word
but
when
they
had
recovered
breath
to
speak
king
arthur
said
certainly
we
ought
greatly
to
thank
the
lord
for
what
he
hath
showed
us
this
day
then
sir
gawain
rose
up
and
made
a
vow
that
for
twelve
months
and
a
day
he
would
seek
the
sangreal
and
not
return
till
he
had
seen
it
if
so
he
might
speed
when
they
of
the
round
table
heard
sir
gawain
say
so
they
arose
the
most
part
of
them
and
vowed
the
same
when
king
arthur
heard
this
he
was
greatly
displeased
for
he
knew
well
that
they
might
not
gainsay
their
vows
alas
said
he
to
sir
gawain
you
have
nigh
slain
me
with
the
vow
and
promise
that
ye
have
made
for
ye
have
bereft
me
of
the
fairest
fellowship
that
ever
were
seen
together
in
any
realm
of
the
world
for
when
they
shall
depart
hence
i
am
sure
that
all
shall
never
meet
more
in
this
world
sir
galahad
at
that
time
there
entered
the
hall
a
good
old
man
and
with
him
he
brought
a
young
knight
and
these
words
he
said
peace
be
with
you
fair
lords
then
the
old
man
said
unto
king
arthur
sir
i
bring
you
here
a
young
knight
that
is
of
kings
lineage
and
of
the
kindred
of
joseph
of
arimathea
being
the
son
of
dame
elaine
the
daughter
of
king
pelles
king
of
the
foreign
country
now
the
name
of
the
young
knight
was
sir
galahad
and
he
was
the
son
of
sir
launcelot
du
lac
but
he
had
dwelt
with
his
mother
at
the
court
of
king
pelles
his
grandfather
till
now
he
was
old
enough
to
bear
arms
and
his
mother
had
sent
him
in
the
charge
of
a
holy
hermit
to
king
arthur
court
then
sir
launcelot
beheld
his
son
and
had
great
joy
of
him
and
sir
bohort
told
his
fellows
upon
my
life
this
young
knight
shall
come
to
great
worship
the
noise
was
great
in
all
the
court
so
that
it
came
to
the
queen
and
she
said
i
would
fain
see
him
for
he
must
needs
be
a
noble
knight
for
so
is
his
father
and
the
queen
and
her
ladies
all
said
that
he
resembled
much
unto
his
father
and
he
was
seemly
and
demure
as
a
dove
with
all
manner
of
good
features
that
in
the
whole
world
men
might
not
find
his
match
and
king
arthur
said
god
make
him
a
good
man
for
beauty
faileth
him
not
as
any
that
liveth
then
the
hermit
led
the
young
knight
to
the
siege
perilous
and
he
lifted
up
the
cloth
and
found
there
letters
that
said
this
is
the
seat
of
sir
galahad
the
good
knight
and
he
made
him
sit
in
that
seat
and
all
the
knights
of
the
round
table
marvelled
greatly
at
sir
galahad
seeing
him
sit
securely
in
that
seat
and
said
this
is
he
by
whom
the
sangreal
shall
be
achieved
for
there
never
sat
one
before
in
that
seat
without
being
mischieved
on
the
next
day
the
king
said
now
at
this
quest
of
the
sangreal
shall
all
ye
of
the
round
table
depart
and
never
shall
i
see
you
again
altogether
therefore
i
will
that
ye
all
repair
to
the
meadow
of
camelot
for
to
just
and
tourney
yet
once
more
before
ye
depart
but
all
the
meaning
of
the
king
was
to
see
sir
galahad
proved
so
then
were
they
all
assembled
in
the
meadow
then
sir
galahad
by
request
of
the
king
and
queen
put
on
his
harness
and
his
helm
but
shield
would
he
take
none
for
any
prayer
of
the
king
and
the
queen
was
in
a
tower
with
all
her
ladies
to
behold
that
tournament
then
sir
galahad
rode
into
the
midst
of
the
meadow
and
there
he
began
to
break
spears
marvellously
so
that
all
men
had
wonder
of
him
for
he
surmounted
all
knights
that
encountered
with
him
except
two
sir
launcelot
and
sir
perceval
so
many
knights
that
all
the
people
cried
and
almost
burst
the
barriers
in
their
heat
shouting
galahad
and
sir
perceval
sir
galahad
then
the
king
at
the
queen
request
made
him
to
alight
and
presented
him
to
the
queen
and
she
said
never
two
men
resembled
one
another
more
than
he
and
sir
launcelot
and
therefore
it
is
no
marvel
that
he
is
like
him
in
prowess
then
the
king
and
the
queen
went
to
the
minster
and
the
knights
followed
them
and
after
the
service
was
done
they
put
on
their
helms
and
departed
and
there
was
great
sorrow
they
rode
through
the
streets
of
camelot
and
there
was
weeping
of
the
rich
and
poor
and
the
king
turned
away
and
might
not
speak
for
weeping
and
so
they
departed
and
every
knight
took
the
way
that
him
best
liked
sir
galahad
rode
forth
without
shield
and
rode
four
days
and
found
no
adventure
and
on
the
fourth
day
he
came
to
a
white
abbey
and
there
he
was
received
with
great
reverence
and
led
to
a
chamber
he
met
there
two
knights
king
bagdemagus
and
sir
uwaine
and
they
made
of
him
great
solace
sirs
said
sir
galahad
what
adventure
brought
you
hither
sir
said
they
it
is
told
us
that
within
this
place
is
a
shield
which
no
man
may
bear
unless
he
be
worthy
and
if
one
unworthy
should
attempt
to
bear
it
it
shall
surely
do
him
a
mischief
then
king
bagdemagus
said
i
fear
not
to
bear
it
and
that
shall
ye
see
morrow
so
on
the
morrow
they
arose
and
heard
mass
then
king
bagdemagus
asked
where
the
adventurous
shield
was
anon
a
monk
led
him
behind
an
altar
where
the
shield
hung
as
white
as
snow
but
in
the
midst
there
was
a
red
cross
then
king
bagdemagus
took
the
shield
and
bare
it
out
of
the
minster
and
he
said
to
sir
galahad
if
it
please
you
abide
here
till
ye
know
how
i
shall
speed
then
king
bagdemagus
and
his
squire
rode
forth
and
when
they
had
ridden
a
mile
or
two
they
saw
a
goodly
knight
come
towards
them
in
white
armor
horse
and
all
and
he
came
as
fast
as
his
horse
might
run
with
his
spear
in
the
rest
and
king
bagdemagus
directed
his
spear
against
him
and
broke
it
upon
the
white
knight
but
the
other
struck
him
so
hard
that
he
broke
the
mails
and
thrust
him
through
the
right
shoulder
for
the
shield
covered
him
not
and
so
he
bare
him
from
his
horse
then
the
white
knight
turned
his
horse
and
rode
away
then
the
squire
went
to
king
bagdemagus
and
asked
him
whether
he
were
sore
wounded
or
not
i
am
sore
wounded
said
he
and
full
hardly
shall
i
escape
death
then
the
squire
set
him
on
his
horse
and
brought
him
to
an
abbey
and
there
he
was
taken
down
softly
and
unarmed
and
laid
in
a
bed
and
his
wound
was
looked
to
for
he
lay
there
long
and
hardly
escaped
with
his
life
and
the
squire
brought
the
shield
back
to
the
abbey
the
next
day
sir
galahad
took
the
shield
and
within
a
while
he
came
to
the
hermitage
where
he
met
the
white
knight
and
each
saluted
the
other
courteously
sir
said
sir
galahad
can
you
tell
me
the
marvel
of
the
shield
sir
said
the
white
knight
that
shield
belonged
of
old
to
the
gentle
knight
joseph
of
arimathea
and
when
he
came
to
die
he
said
shall
man
bear
this
shield
about
his
neck
but
he
shall
repent
it
unto
the
time
that
sir
galahad
the
good
knight
bear
it
the
last
of
my
lineage
the
which
shall
do
many
marvellous
deeds
and
then
the
white
knight
vanished
away
sir
gawain
after
sir
gawain
departed
he
rode
many
days
both
toward
and
forward
and
at
last
he
came
to
the
abbey
where
sir
galahad
took
the
white
shield
and
they
told
sir
gawain
of
the
marvellous
adventure
that
sir
galahad
had
done
truly
said
sir
gawain
i
am
not
happy
that
i
took
not
the
way
that
he
went
for
if
i
may
meet
with
him
i
will
not
part
from
him
lightly
that
i
may
partake
with
him
all
the
marvellous
adventures
which
he
shall
achieve
sir
said
one
of
the
monks
he
will
not
be
of
your
fellowship
why
said
sir
gawain
sir
said
he
because
ye
be
sinful
and
he
is
blissful
then
said
the
monk
sir
gawain
thou
must
do
penance
for
thy
sins
sir
what
penance
shall
i
do
such
as
i
will
show
said
the
good
man
nay
said
sir
gawain
i
will
do
no
penance
for
we
knights
adventurous
often
suffer
great
woe
and
pain
well
said
the
good
man
and
he
held
his
peace
and
sir
gawain
departed
now
it
happened
not
long
after
this
that
sir
gawain
and
sir
hector
rode
together
and
they
came
to
a
castle
where
was
a
great
tournament
and
sir
gawain
and
sir
hector
joined
themselves
to
the
party
that
seemed
the
weaker
and
they
drove
before
them
the
other
party
then
suddenly
came
into
the
lists
a
knight
bearing
a
white
shield
with
a
red
cross
and
by
adventure
he
came
by
sir
gawain
and
he
smote
him
so
hard
that
he
clave
his
helm
and
wounded
his
head
so
that
sir
gawain
fell
to
the
earth
when
sir
hector
saw
that
he
knew
that
the
knight
with
the
white
shield
was
sir
galahad
and
he
thought
it
no
wisdom
to
abide
him
and
also
for
natural
love
that
he
was
his
uncle
then
sir
galahad
retired
privily
so
that
none
knew
where
he
had
gone
and
sir
hector
raised
up
sir
gawain
and
said
sir
me
seemeth
your
quest
is
done
it
is
done
said
sir
gawain
i
shall
seek
no
further
then
gawain
was
borne
into
the
castle
and
unarmed
and
laid
in
a
rich
bed
and
a
leech
found
to
search
his
wound
and
sir
gawain
and
sir
hector
abode
together
for
sir
hector
would
not
away
till
sir
gawain
were
whole
chapter
xx
the
sangreal
continued
sir
launcelot
sir
launcelot
rode
overthwart
and
endlong
in
a
wide
forest
and
held
no
path
but
as
wild
adventure
lee
him
my
golden
spurs
now
bring
to
me
and
bring
to
me
my
richest
mail
for
i
go
over
land
and
sea
in
search
of
the
holy
holy
grail
shall
never
a
bed
for
me
be
spread
nor
shall
a
pillow
be
under
my
head
till
i
begin
my
vow
to
keep
here
on
the
rushes
will
i
sleep
and
perchance
there
may
come
a
vision
true
ere
day
create
the
world
anew
lowell
holy
grail
and
at
last
he
came
to
a
stone
cross
then
sir
launcelot
looked
round
him
and
saw
an
old
chapel
so
he
tied
his
horse
to
a
tree
and
put
off
his
shield
and
hung
it
upon
a
tree
and
then
he
went
into
the
chapel
and
looked
through
a
place
where
the
wall
was
broken
and
within
he
saw
a
fair
altar
full
richly
arrayed
with
cloth
of
silk
and
there
stood
a
fair
candlestick
which
bare
six
great
candles
and
the
candlestick
was
of
silver
when
sir
launcelot
saw
this
sight
he
had
a
great
wish
to
enter
the
chapel
but
he
could
find
no
place
where
he
might
enter
then
was
he
passing
heavy
and
dismayed
and
he
returned
and
came
again
to
his
horse
and
took
off
his
saddle
and
his
bridle
and
let
him
pasture
and
unlaced
his
helm
and
ungirded
his
sword
and
laid
him
down
to
sleep
upon
his
shield
before
the
cross
and
as
he
lay
half
waking
and
half
sleeping
he
saw
come
by
him
two
palfreys
both
fair
and
white
which
bare
a
litter
on
which
lay
a
sick
knight
and
when
he
was
nigh
the
cross
he
there
abode
still
and
sir
launcelot
heard
him
say
o
sweet
lord
when
shall
this
sorrow
leave
me
and
when
shall
the
holy
vessel
come
by
me
whereby
i
shall
be
healed
and
thus
a
great
while
complained
the
knight
and
sir
launcelot
heard
it
then
sir
launcelot
saw
the
candlestick
with
the
lighted
tapers
come
before
the
cross
but
he
could
see
nobody
that
brought
it
also
there
came
a
salver
of
silver
and
the
holy
vessel
of
the
sangreal
and
therewithal
the
sick
knight
sat
him
upright
and
held
up
both
his
hands
and
said
fair
sweet
lord
which
is
here
within
the
holy
vessel
take
heed
to
me
that
i
may
be
whole
of
this
great
malady
and
therewith
upon
his
hands
and
upon
his
knees
he
went
so
nigh
that
he
touched
the
holy
vessel
and
kissed
it
and
anon
he
was
whole
then
the
holy
vessel
went
into
the
chapel
again
with
the
candlestick
and
the
light
so
that
sir
launcelot
wist
not
what
became
of
it
then
the
sick
knight
rose
up
and
kissed
the
cross
and
anon
his
squire
brought
him
his
arms
and
asked
his
lord
how
he
did
i
thank
god
right
heartily
said
he
for
through
the
holy
vessel
i
am
healed
but
i
have
great
marvel
of
this
sleeping
knight
who
hath
had
neither
grace
nor
power
to
awake
during
the
time
that
the
holy
vessel
hath
been
here
present
i
dare
it
right
well
say
said
the
squire
that
this
same
knight
is
stained
with
some
manner
of
deadly
sin
whereof
he
was
never
confessed
so
they
departed
then
anon
sir
launcelot
waked
and
set
himself
upright
and
bethought
him
of
what
he
had
seen
and
whether
it
were
dreams
or
not
and
he
was
passing
heavy
and
wist
not
what
to
do
and
he
said
my
sin
and
my
wretchedness
hath
brought
me
into
great
dishonor
for
when
i
sought
worldly
adventures
and
worldly
desires
i
ever
achieved
them
and
had
the
better
in
every
place
and
never
was
i
discomfited
in
any
quarrel
were
it
right
or
wrong
and
now
i
take
upon
me
the
adventure
of
holy
things
i
see
and
understand
that
mine
old
sin
hindereth
me
so
that
i
had
no
power
to
stir
nor
to
speak
when
the
holy
blood
appeared
before
me
so
thus
he
sorrowed
till
it
was
day
and
heard
the
fowls
of
the
air
sing
then
was
he
somewhat
comforted
then
he
departed
from
the
cross
into
the
forest
and
there
he
found
a
hermitage
and
a
hermit
therein
who
was
going
to
mass
so
when
mass
was
done
sir
launcelot
called
the
hermit
to
him
and
prayed
him
for
charity
to
hear
his
confession
with
a
good
will
said
the
good
man
and
then
he
told
that
good
man
all
his
life
and
how
he
had
loved
a
queen
unmeasurably
many
years
and
all
my
great
deeds
of
arms
that
i
have
done
i
did
the
most
part
for
the
queen
sake
and
for
her
sake
would
i
do
battle
were
it
right
or
wrong
and
never
did
i
battle
all
only
for
god
sake
but
for
to
win
worship
and
to
cause
me
to
be
better
beloved
and
little
or
naught
i
thanked
god
for
it
i
pray
you
counsel
me
i
will
counsel
you
said
the
hermit
if
ye
will
insure
me
that
ye
will
never
come
in
that
queen
fellowship
as
much
as
ye
may
forbear
and
then
sir
launcelot
promised
the
hermit
by
his
faith
that
he
would
no
more
come
in
her
company
look
that
your
heart
and
your
mouth
accord
said
the
good
man
and
i
shall
insure
you
that
ye
shall
have
more
worship
than
ever
ye
had
then
the
good
man
enjoined
sir
launcelot
such
penance
as
he
might
do
and
he
assailed
sir
launcelot
and
made
him
abide
with
him
all
that
day
and
sir
launcelot
repented
him
greatly
sir
perceval
sir
perceval
departed
and
rode
till
the
hour
of
noon
and
he
met
in
a
valley
about
twenty
men
of
arms
and
when
they
saw
sir
perceval
they
asked
him
whence
he
was
and
he
answered
of
the
court
of
king
arthur
then
they
cried
all
at
once
slay
him
but
sir
perceval
smote
the
first
to
the
earth
and
his
horse
upon
him
then
seven
of
the
knights
smote
upon
his
shield
all
at
once
and
the
remnant
slew
his
horse
so
that
he
fell
to
the
earth
so
had
they
slain
him
or
taken
him
had
not
the
good
knight
sir
galahad
with
the
red
cross
come
there
by
adventure
and
when
he
saw
all
the
knights
upon
one
he
cried
out
save
me
that
life
then
he
rode
toward
the
twenty
men
of
arms
as
fast
as
his
horse
might
drive
with
his
spear
in
the
rest
and
smote
the
foremost
horse
and
man
to
the
earth
and
when
his
spear
was
broken
he
set
his
hand
to
his
sword
and
smote
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
that
it
was
marvel
to
see
and
at
every
stroke
he
smote
down
one
or
put
him
to
rebuke
so
that
they
would
fight
no
more
but
fled
to
a
thick
forest
and
sir
galahad
followed
them
and
when
sir
perceval
saw
him
chase
them
so
he
made
great
sorrow
that
his
horse
was
slain
and
he
wist
well
it
was
sir
galahad
then
he
cried
aloud
ah
fair
knight
abide
and
suffer
me
to
do
thanks
unto
thee
for
right
well
have
ye
done
for
me
but
sir
galahad
rode
so
fast
that
at
last
he
passed
out
of
his
sight
when
sir
perceval
saw
that
he
would
not
turn
he
said
now
am
i
a
very
wretch
and
most
unhappy
above
all
other
knights
so
in
his
sorrow
he
abode
all
that
day
till
it
was
night
and
then
he
was
faint
and
laid
him
down
and
slept
till
midnight
and
then
he
awaked
and
saw
before
him
a
woman
who
said
unto
him
sir
perceval
what
dost
thou
here
he
answered
i
do
neither
good
nor
great
if
thou
wilt
promise
me
said
she
that
thou
wilt
fulfil
my
will
when
i
summon
thee
i
will
lend
thee
my
own
horse
which
shall
bear
thee
whither
thou
wilt
sir
perceval
was
glad
of
her
proffer
and
insured
her
to
fulfil
all
her
desire
then
abide
me
here
and
i
will
go
fetch
you
a
horse
and
so
she
soon
came
again
and
brought
a
horse
with
her
that
was
inky
black
when
perceval
beheld
that
horse
he
marvelled
it
was
so
great
and
so
well
apparelled
and
he
leapt
upon
him
and
took
no
heed
of
himself
and
he
thrust
him
with
his
spurs
and
within
an
hour
and
less
he
bare
him
four
days
journey
thence
until
he
came
to
a
rough
water
which
roared
and
his
horse
would
have
borne
him
into
it
and
when
sir
perceval
came
nigh
the
brim
and
saw
the
water
so
boisterous
he
doubted
to
overpass
it
and
then
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
forehead
when
the
fiend
felt
him
so
charged
he
shook
off
sir
perceval
and
went
into
the
water
crying
and
roaring
and
it
seemed
unto
him
that
the
water
burned
then
sir
perceval
perceived
it
was
a
fiend
that
would
have
brought
him
unto
his
perdition
then
he
commended
himself
unto
god
and
prayed
our
lord
to
keep
him
from
all
such
temptations
and
so
he
prayed
all
that
night
till
it
was
day
then
he
saw
that
he
was
in
a
wild
place
that
was
closed
with
the
sea
nigh
all
about
and
sir
perceval
looked
forth
over
the
sea
and
saw
a
ship
come
sailing
towards
him
and
it
came
and
stood
still
under
the
rock
and
when
sir
perceval
saw
this
he
hied
him
thither
and
found
the
ship
covered
with
silk
and
therein
was
a
lady
of
great
beauty
and
clothed
so
richly
that
none
might
be
better
and
when
she
saw
sir
perceval
she
saluted
him
and
sir
perceval
returned
her
salutation
then
he
asked
her
of
her
country
and
her
lineage
and
she
said
i
am
a
gentlewoman
that
am
disinherited
and
was
once
the
richest
woman
of
the
world
damsel
said
sir
perceval
who
hath
disinherited
you
for
i
have
great
pity
of
you
sir
said
she
my
enemy
is
a
great
and
powerful
lord
and
aforetime
he
made
much
of
me
so
that
of
his
favor
and
of
my
beauty
i
had
a
little
pride
more
than
i
ought
to
have
had
also
i
said
a
word
that
pleased
him
not
so
he
drove
me
from
his
company
and
from
mine
heritage
therefore
i
know
no
good
knight
nor
good
man
but
i
get
him
on
my
side
if
i
may
and
for
that
i
know
that
thou
art
a
good
knight
i
beseech
thee
to
help
me
then
sir
perceval
promised
her
all
the
help
that
he
might
and
she
thanked
him
and
at
that
time
the
weather
was
hot
and
she
called
to
her
a
gentlewoman
and
bade
her
bring
forth
a
pavilion
and
she
did
so
and
pitched
it
upon
the
gravel
sir
said
she
now
may
ye
rest
you
in
this
heat
of
the
day
then
he
thanked
her
and
she
put
off
his
helm
and
his
shield
and
there
he
slept
a
great
while
then
he
awoke
and
asked
her
if
she
had
any
meat
and
she
said
yea
and
so
there
was
set
upon
the
table
all
manner
of
meats
that
he
could
think
on
also
he
drank
there
the
strongest
wine
that
ever
he
drank
and
therewith
he
was
a
little
chafed
more
than
he
ought
to
be
with
that
he
beheld
the
lady
and
he
thought
she
was
the
fairest
creature
that
ever
he
saw
and
then
sir
perceval
proffered
her
love
and
prayed
her
that
she
would
be
his
then
she
refused
him
in
a
manner
for
the
cause
he
should
be
the
more
ardent
on
her
and
ever
he
ceased
not
to
pray
her
of
love
and
when
she
saw
him
well
enchafed
then
she
said
sir
perceval
wit
you
well
i
shall
not
give
ye
my
love
unless
you
swear
from
henceforth
you
will
be
my
true
servant
and
do
no
thing
but
that
i
shall
command
you
will
you
insure
me
this
as
ye
be
a
true
knight
yea
said
he
fair
lady
by
the
faith
of
my
body
and
as
he
said
this
by
adventure
and
grace
he
saw
his
sword
lie
on
the
ground
naked
in
whose
pommel
was
a
red
cross
and
the
sign
of
the
crucifix
thereon
then
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
forehead
and
therewith
the
pavilion
shrivelled
up
and
changed
into
a
smoke
and
a
black
cloud
and
the
damsel
cried
aloud
and
hasted
into
the
ship
and
so
she
went
with
the
wind
roaring
and
yelling
that
it
seemed
all
the
water
burned
after
her
then
sir
perceval
made
great
sorrow
and
called
himself
a
wretch
saying
how
nigh
was
i
lost
then
he
took
his
arms
and
departed
thence
chapter
xxi
the
sangreal
continued
sir
bohort
when
sir
boliort
departed
from
camelot
he
met
with
a
religious
man
riding
upon
an
ass
and
sir
bohort
saluted
him
what
are
ye
said
the
good
man
sir
said
sir
bohort
i
am
a
knight
that
fain
would
be
counselled
in
the
quest
of
the
sangreal
so
rode
they
both
together
till
they
came
to
a
hermitage
and
there
he
prayed
sir
bohort
to
dwell
that
night
with
him
so
he
alighted
and
put
away
his
armor
and
prayed
him
that
he
might
be
confessed
and
they
went
both
into
the
chapel
and
there
he
was
clean
confessed
and
they
ate
bread
and
drank
water
together
now
said
the
good
man
i
pray
thee
that
thou
eat
none
other
till
thou
sit
at
the
table
where
the
sangreal
shall
be
sir
said
sir
bohort
but
how
know
ye
that
i
shall
sit
there
yea
said
the
good
man
that
i
know
well
but
there
shall
be
few
of
your
fellows
with
you
then
said
sir
bohort
i
agree
me
thereto
and
the
good
man
when
he
had
heard
his
confession
found
him
in
so
pure
a
life
and
so
stable
that
he
marvelled
thereof
on
the
morrow
as
soon
as
the
day
appeared
sir
bohort
departed
thence
and
rode
into
a
forest
unto
the
hour
of
midday
and
there
befell
him
a
marvellous
adventure
for
he
met
at
the
parting
of
two
ways
two
knights
that
led
sir
lionel
his
brother
all
naked
bound
upon
a
strong
hackney
and
his
hands
bound
before
his
breast
and
each
of
them
held
in
his
hand
thorns
wherewith
they
went
beating
him
so
that
he
was
all
bloody
before
and
behind
but
he
said
never
a
word
but
as
he
was
great
of
heart
he
suffered
all
that
they
did
to
him
as
though
he
had
felt
none
anguish
sir
bohort
prepared
to
rescue
his
brother
but
he
looked
on
the
other
side
of
him
and
saw
a
knight
dragging
along
a
fair
gentlewoman
who
cried
out
saint
mary
succor
your
maid
and
when
she
saw
sir
bohort
she
called
to
him
and
said
by
the
faith
that
ye
owe
to
knighthood
help
me
when
sir
bohort
heard
her
say
thus
he
had
such
sorrow
that
he
wist
not
what
to
do
for
if
i
let
my
brother
be
he
must
be
slain
and
that
would
i
not
for
all
the
earth
and
if
i
help
not
the
maid
i
am
shamed
for
ever
then
lift
he
up
his
eyes
and
said
weeping
fair
lord
whose
liegeman
i
am
keep
sir
lionel
my
brother
that
none
of
these
knights
slay
him
and
for
pity
of
you
and
our
lady
sake
i
shall
succor
this
maid
then
he
cried
out
to
the
knight
sir
knight
lay
your
hand
off
that
maid
or
else
ye
be
but
dead
then
the
knight
set
down
the
maid
and
took
his
shield
and
drew
out
his
sword
and
sir
bohort
smote
him
so
hard
that
it
went
through
his
shield
and
habergeon
on
the
left
shoulder
and
he
fell
down
to
the
earth
then
came
sir
bohort
to
the
maid
ye
be
delivered
of
this
knight
this
time
now
said
she
i
pray
you
lead
me
there
where
this
knight
took
me
i
shall
gladly
do
it
said
sir
bohort
so
he
took
the
horse
of
the
wounded
knight
and
set
the
gentlewoman
upon
it
and
brought
her
there
where
she
desired
to
be
and
there
he
found
twelve
knights
seeking
after
her
and
when
she
told
them
how
sir
bohort
had
delivered
her
they
made
great
joy
and
besought
him
to
come
to
her
father
a
great
lord
and
he
should
be
right
welcomed
truly
said
sir
bohort
that
may
not
be
for
i
have
a
great
adventure
to
do
so
he
commended
them
to
god
and
departed
then
sir
bohort
rode
after
sir
lionel
his
brother
by
the
trace
of
their
horses
thus
he
rode
seeking
a
great
while
then
he
overtook
a
man
clothed
in
a
religious
clothing
who
said
sir
knight
what
seek
ye
sir
said
sir
bohort
i
seek
my
brother
that
i
saw
within
a
little
space
beaten
of
two
knights
ah
sir
bohort
tiouble
not
thyself
to
seek
for
him
for
truly
he
is
dead
then
he
showed
him
a
body
lying
in
a
thick
bush
and
it
seemed
him
that
it
was
the
body
of
sir
lionel
and
then
he
made
such
sorrow
that
he
fell
to
the
ground
in
a
swoon
and
lay
there
long
and
when
he
came
to
himself
again
he
said
fair
brother
since
the
fellowship
of
you
and
me
is
sundered
shall
i
never
have
joy
again
and
now
he
that
i
have
taken
for
my
master
he
be
my
help
and
when
he
had
said
thus
he
took
up
the
body
in
his
arms
and
put
it
upon
the
horse
and
then
he
said
to
the
man
canst
thou
tell
me
the
way
to
some
chapel
where
i
may
bury
this
body
come
on
said
the
man
here
is
one
fast
by
and
so
they
rode
till
they
saw
a
fair
tower
and
beside
it
a
chapel
then
they
alighted
both
and
put
the
body
into
a
tomb
of
marble
then
sir
bohort
commended
the
good
man
unto
god
and
departed
and
he
rode
all
that
day
and
harbored
with
an
old
lady
and
on
the
morrow
he
rode
unto
the
castle
in
a
valley
and
there
he
met
with
a
yeoman
tell
me
said
sir
bohort
knowest
thou
of
any
adventure
sir
said
he
here
shall
be
under
this
castle
a
great
and
marvellous
tournament
then
sir
bohort
thought
to
be
there
if
he
might
meet
with
any
of
the
fellowship
that
were
in
quest
of
the
sangreal
so
he
turned
to
a
hermitage
that
was
on
the
border
of
the
forest
and
when
he
was
come
hither
he
found
there
sir
lionel
his
brother
who
sat
all
armed
at
the
entry
of
the
chapel
door
and
when
sir
bohort
saw
him
he
had
great
joy
and
he
alighted
off
his
horse
and
said
fair
brother
when
came
ye
hither
as
soon
as
sir
lionel
saw
him
he
said
ah
sir
bohort
make
ye
no
false
show
for
as
for
you
i
might
have
been
slain
for
ye
left
me
in
peril
of
death
to
go
succor
a
gentlewoman
and
for
that
misdeed
i
now
assure
you
but
death
for
ye
have
right
well
deserved
it
when
sir
bohort
perceived
his
brother
wrath
he
kneeled
down
to
the
earth
and
cried
him
mercy
holding
up
both
his
hands
and
prayed
him
to
forgive
him
nay
said
sir
lionel
thou
shalt
have
but
death
for
it
if
i
have
the
upper
hand
therefore
leap
upon
thy
horse
and
keep
thyself
and
if
thou
do
not
i
will
run
upon
thee
there
as
thou
standest
on
foot
and
so
the
shame
shall
be
mine
and
the
harm
thine
but
of
that
i
reck
not
when
sir
bohort
saw
that
he
must
fight
with
his
brother
or
else
die
he
wist
not
what
to
do
then
his
heart
counselled
him
not
so
to
do
inasmuch
as
sir
lionel
was
his
elder
brother
wherefore
he
ought
to
bear
him
reverence
yet
kneeled
he
down
before
sir
lionel
horse
feet
and
said
fair
brother
have
mercy
upon
me
and
slay
me
not
but
sir
lionel
cared
not
for
the
fiend
had
brought
him
in
such
a
will
that
he
should
slay
him
when
he
saw
that
sir
bohort
would
not
rise
to
give
him
battle
he
rushed
over
him
so
that
he
smote
him
with
his
horse
feet
to
the
earth
and
hurt
him
sore
that
he
swooned
of
distress
when
sir
lionel
saw
this
he
alighted
from
his
horse
for
to
have
smitten
off
his
head
and
so
he
took
him
by
the
helm
and
would
have
rent
it
from
his
head
but
it
happened
that
sir
colgrevance
a
knight
of
the
round
table
came
at
that
time
thither
as
it
was
our
lord
will
and
then
he
beheld
how
sir
lionel
would
have
slain
his
brother
and
he
knew
sir
bohort
whom
he
loved
right
well
then
leapt
he
down
from
his
horse
and
took
sir
lionel
by
the
shoulders
and
drew
him
strongly
back
from
sir
bohort
and
said
sir
lionel
will
ye
slay
your
brother
why
said
sir
lionel
will
ye
stay
me
if
ye
interfere
in
this
i
will
slay
you
and
him
after
then
he
ran
upon
sir
bohort
and
would
have
smitten
him
but
sir
colgrevance
ran
between
them
and
said
if
ye
persist
to
do
so
any
more
we
two
shall
meddle
together
then
sir
lionel
defied
him
and
gave
him
a
great
stroke
through
the
helm
then
he
drew
his
sword
for
he
was
a
passing
good
knight
and
defended
himself
right
manfully
so
long
endured
the
battle
that
sir
bohort
rose
up
all
anguishly
and
beheld
sir
colgrevance
the
good
knight
fight
with
his
brother
for
his
quarrel
then
was
he
full
sorry
and
heavy
and
thought
that
if
sir
colgrevance
slew
him
that
was
his
brother
he
should
never
have
joy
and
if
his
brother
slew
sir
colgrevance
the
shame
should
ever
be
his
then
would
he
have
risen
for
to
have
parted
them
but
he
had
not
so
much
strength
to
stand
on
his
feet
so
he
staid
so
long
that
sir
colgrevance
had
the
worse
for
sir
lionel
was
of
great
chivalry
and
right
hardy
then
cried
sir
colgrevance
ah
sir
bohort
why
come
ye
not
to
bring
me
out
of
peril
of
death
wherein
i
have
put
me
to
succor
you
with
that
sir
lionel
smote
off
his
helm
and
bore
him
to
the
earth
and
when
he
had
slain
sir
colgrevance
he
ran
upon
his
brother
as
a
fiendly
man
and
gave
him
such
a
stroke
that
he
made
him
stoop
and
he
that
was
full
of
humility
prayed
him
for
god
sake
leave
this
battle
for
if
it
befell
fair
brother
that
i
slew
you
or
ye
me
we
should
be
dead
of
that
sin
pray
ye
not
me
for
mercy
said
sir
lionel
then
sir
bohort
all
weeping
drew
his
sword
and
said
now
god
have
mercy
upon
me
though
i
defend
my
life
against
my
brother
with
that
sir
bohort
lifted
up
his
sword
and
would
have
smitten
his
brother
then
he
heard
a
voice
that
said
flee
sir
bohort
and
touch
him
not
right
so
alighted
a
cloud
between
them
in
the
likeness
of
a
fire
and
a
marvellous
flame
so
that
they
both
fell
to
the
earth
and
lay
there
a
great
while
in
a
swoon
and
when
they
came
to
themselves
sir
bohort
saw
that
his
brother
had
no
harm
and
he
was
right
glad
for
he
dread
sore
that
god
had
taken
vengeance
upon
him
then
sir
lionel
said
to
his
brother
brother
forgive
me
for
god
sake
all
that
i
have
trespassed
against
you
and
sir
bohort
answered
god
forgive
it
thee
and
i
do
with
that
sir
bohort
heard
a
voice
say
sir
bohort
take
thy
way
anon
right
to
the
sea
for
sir
perceval
abideth
thee
there
so
sir
bohort
departed
and
rode
the
nearest
way
to
the
sea
and
at
last
he
came
to
an
abbey
that
was
nigh
the
sea
that
night
he
rested
him
there
and
in
his
sleep
there
came
a
voice
unto
him
and
bade
him
go
to
the
he
started
up
and
made
a
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
forehead
and
armed
himself
and
made
ready
his
horse
and
mounted
him
and
at
a
broken
wall
he
rode
out
and
came
to
the
and
there
he
found
a
ship
covered
all
with
white
samite
and
he
entered
into
the
ship
but
it
was
anon
so
dark
that
he
might
see
no
man
and
he
laid
him
down
and
slept
till
it
was
day
then
he
awaked
and
saw
in
the
middle
of
the
ship
a
knight
all
armed
save
his
helm
and
then
he
knew
it
was
sir
perceval
de
galis
and
each
made
of
other
right
great
joy
then
said
sir
perceval
we
lack
nothing
now
but
the
good
knight
sir
galahad
sir
launcelot
resumed
it
befell
upon
a
night
sir
launcelot
arrived
before
a
castle
which
was
rich
and
fair
and
there
was
a
postern
that
was
opened
toward
the
sea
and
was
open
without
any
keeping
save
two
lions
kept
the
entry
and
the
moon
shined
clear
anon
sir
launcelot
heard
a
voice
that
said
launcelot
enter
into
the
castle
where
thou
shalt
see
a
great
part
of
thy
desire
so
he
went
unto
the
gate
and
saw
the
two
lions
then
he
set
hands
to
his
sword
and
drew
it
then
there
came
suddenly
as
it
were
a
stroke
upon
the
arm
so
sore
that
the
sword
fell
out
of
his
hand
and
he
heard
a
voice
that
said
o
man
of
evil
faith
wherefore
believest
thou
more
in
thy
armor
than
in
thy
maker
then
said
sir
launcelot
fair
lord
i
thank
thee
of
thy
great
mercy
that
thou
reprovest
me
of
my
misdeed
now
see
i
well
that
thou
holdest
me
for
thy
servant
then
he
made
a
cross
on
his
forehead
and
came
to
the
lions
and
they
made
semblance
to
do
him
harm
but
he
passed
them
without
hurt
and
entered
into
the
castle
and
he
found
no
gate
nor
door
but
it
was
open
but
at
the
last
he
found
a
chamber
whereof
the
door
was
shut
and
he
set
his
hand
thereto
to
have
opened
it
but
he
might
not
then
he
listened
and
heard
a
voice
which
sung
so
sweetly
that
it
seemed
none
earthly
thing
and
the
voice
said
joy
and
honor
be
to
the
father
of
heaven
then
sir
launcelot
kneeled
down
before
the
chamber
for
well
he
wist
that
there
was
the
sangreal
in
that
chamber
then
said
he
fair
sweet
lord
if
ever
i
did
anything
that
pleased
thee
for
thy
pity
show
me
something
of
that
which
i
seek
and
with
that
he
saw
the
chamber
door
open
and
there
came
out
a
great
clearness
that
the
house
was
as
bright
as
though
all
the
torches
of
the
world
had
been
there
so
he
came
to
the
chamber
door
and
would
have
entered
and
anon
a
voice
said
unto
him
stay
sir
launcelot
and
enter
not
and
he
withdrew
him
back
and
was
right
heavy
in
his
mind
then
looked
he
in
the
midst
of
the
chamber
and
saw
a
table
of
silver
and
the
holy
vessel
covered
with
red
samite
and
many
angels
about
it
whereof
one
held
a
candle
of
wax
burning
and
another
held
a
cross
and
the
ornaments
of
the
altar
o
yet
methought
i
saw
the
holy
grail
all
pall
in
crimson
samite
and
around
great
angels
awful
shapes
and
wings
and
eyes
the
holy
grail
then
for
very
wonder
and
thankfulness
sir
launcelot
forgot
himself
and
he
stepped
forward
and
entered
the
chamber
and
suddenly
a
breath
that
seemed
intermixed
with
fire
smote
him
so
sore
in
the
visage
that
therewith
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
had
no
power
to
rise
then
felt
he
many
hands
about
him
which
took
him
up
and
bare
him
out
of
the
chamber
without
any
amending
of
his
swoon
and
left
him
there
seeming
dead
to
all
the
people
so
on
the
morrow
when
it
was
fair
daylight
and
they
within
were
arisen
they
found
sir
launcelot
lying
before
the
chamber
door
and
they
looked
upon
him
and
felt
his
pulse
to
know
if
there
were
any
life
in
him
and
they
found
life
in
him
but
he
might
neither
stand
nor
stir
any
member
that
he
had
so
they
took
him
and
bare
him
into
a
chamber
and
laid
him
upon
a
bed
far
from
all
folk
and
there
he
lay
many
days
then
the
one
said
he
was
alive
and
the
others
said
nay
but
said
an
old
man
he
is
as
full
of
life
as
the
mightiest
of
you
all
and
therefore
i
counsel
you
that
he
be
well
kept
till
god
bring
him
back
again
and
after
days
he
opened
his
eyes
and
when
he
saw
folk
he
made
great
sorrow
and
said
why
have
ye
wakened
me
for
i
was
better
at
ease
than
i
am
now
what
have
ye
seen
said
they
about
him
i
have
seen
said
he
great
marvels
that
no
tongue
can
tell
and
more
than
any
heart
can
think
then
they
said
sir
the
quest
of
the
sangreal
is
achieved
right
now
in
you
and
never
shall
ye
see
more
of
it
than
ye
have
seen
i
thank
god
said
sir
launcelot
of
his
great
mercy
for
that
i
have
seen
for
it
sufficeth
me
then
he
rose
up
and
clothed
himself
and
when
he
was
so
arrayed
they
marvelled
all
for
they
knew
it
was
sir
launcelot
the
good
knight
and
after
four
days
he
took
his
leave
of
the
lord
of
the
castle
and
of
all
the
fellowship
that
were
there
and
thanked
them
for
their
great
labor
and
care
of
him
then
he
departed
and
turned
to
camelot
where
he
found
king
arthur
and
queen
guenever
but
many
of
the
knights
of
the
round
table
were
slain
and
destroyed
more
than
half
then
all
the
court
was
passing
glad
of
sir
launcelot
and
he
told
the
king
all
his
adventures
that
had
befallen
him
since
he
departed
sir
galahad
now
when
sir
galahad
had
rescued
perceval
from
the
twenty
knights
he
rode
into
a
vast
forest
wherein
he
abode
many
days
then
he
took
his
way
to
the
sea
and
it
befell
him
that
he
was
benighted
in
a
hermitage
and
the
good
man
was
glad
when
he
saw
he
was
a
and
when
they
were
at
rest
there
came
a
gentlewoman
knocking
at
the
door
and
the
good
man
came
to
the
door
to
wit
what
she
would
then
she
said
i
would
speak
with
the
knight
which
is
with
you
then
galahad
went
to
her
and
asked
her
what
she
would
sir
galahad
said
she
i
will
that
ye
arm
you
and
mount
upon
your
horse
and
follow
me
for
i
will
show
you
the
highest
adventure
that
ever
knight
saw
then
galahad
armed
himself
and
commended
himself
to
god
and
bade
the
damsel
go
before
and
he
would
follow
where
she
led
so
she
rode
as
fast
as
her
palfrey
might
bear
her
till
she
came
to
the
sea
and
there
they
found
the
ship
where
sir
bohort
and
sir
perceval
were
who
cried
from
the
ship
sir
galahad
you
are
welcome
we
have
waited
you
long
and
when
he
heard
them
he
asked
the
damsel
who
they
were
sir
said
she
leave
your
horse
here
and
i
shall
leave
mine
and
we
will
join
ourselves
to
their
company
so
they
entered
into
the
ship
and
the
two
knights
received
them
both
with
great
joy
for
they
knew
the
damsel
that
she
was
sir
perceval
sister
then
the
wind
arose
and
drove
them
through
the
sea
all
that
day
and
the
next
till
the
ship
arrived
between
two
rocks
passing
great
and
marvellous
but
there
they
might
not
land
for
there
was
a
whirlpool
but
there
was
another
ship
and
upon
it
they
might
go
without
danger
go
we
thither
said
the
gentlewoman
and
there
we
shall
see
adventures
for
such
is
our
lord
will
then
sir
galahad
blessed
him
and
entered
therein
and
then
next
the
gentlewoman
and
then
sir
bohort
and
sir
perceval
and
when
they
came
on
board
they
found
there
the
table
of
silver
and
the
sangreal
which
was
covered
with
red
samite
and
they
made
great
reverence
thereto
and
sir
galahad
prayed
a
long
time
to
our
lord
that
at
what
time
he
should
ask
to
pass
out
of
this
world
he
should
do
so
and
a
voice
said
to
him
galahad
thou
shalt
have
thy
request
and
when
thou
askest
the
death
of
thy
body
thou
shalt
have
it
and
then
shalt
thou
find
the
life
of
thy
soul
and
anon
the
wind
drove
them
across
the
sea
till
they
came
to
the
city
of
sarras
then
took
they
out
of
the
ship
the
table
of
silver
and
sir
perceval
and
sir
bohort
took
it
before
and
sir
galahad
came
behind
and
right
so
they
went
to
the
city
and
at
the
gate
of
the
city
they
saw
an
old
man
a
cripple
and
sir
launfal
said
behold
in
thee
an
image
of
him
who
died
on
the
tree
thou
also
hast
had
thy
crown
of
thorns
thou
also
hast
had
the
world
buffets
and
scorns
and
to
thy
life
were
not
denied
the
wounds
in
thy
hands
and
feet
and
side
mild
mary
son
acknowledge
me
behold
through
him
i
give
to
thee
lowell
holy
grail
then
galahad
called
him
and
bade
him
help
to
bear
this
heavy
thing
truly
said
the
old
man
it
is
ten
years
since
i
could
not
go
but
with
crutches
care
thou
not
said
sir
galahad
but
arise
up
and
show
thy
good
will
then
the
old
man
rose
up
and
assayed
and
found
himself
as
whole
as
ever
he
was
and
he
ran
to
the
table
and
took
one
part
with
sir
galahad
when
they
came
to
the
city
it
chanced
that
the
king
was
just
dead
and
all
the
city
was
dismayed
and
wist
not
who
might
be
their
king
right
so
as
they
were
in
counsel
there
came
a
voice
among
them
and
bade
them
choose
the
youngest
knight
of
those
three
to
be
their
king
so
they
made
sir
galahad
king
by
all
the
assent
of
the
city
and
when
he
was
made
king
he
commanded
to
make
a
chest
of
gold
and
of
precious
stones
to
hold
the
holy
vessel
and
every
day
the
three
companions
would
come
before
it
and
make
their
prayers
now
at
the
year
end
and
the
same
day
of
the
year
that
sir
galahad
received
the
crown
he
got
up
early
and
with
his
fellows
came
to
where
the
holy
vessel
was
and
they
saw
one
kneeling
before
it
that
had
about
him
a
great
fellowship
of
angels
and
he
called
sir
galahad
and
said
come
thou
servant
of
the
lord
and
thou
shalt
see
what
thou
hast
much
desired
to
see
and
sir
galahad
mortal
flesh
trembled
right
hard
when
he
began
to
behold
the
spiritual
things
then
said
the
good
man
now
wottest
thou
who
i
am
nay
said
sir
galahad
i
am
joseph
of
arimathea
whom
our
lord
hath
sent
here
to
thee
to
bear
thee
fellowship
then
sir
galahad
held
up
his
hands
toward
heaven
and
said
now
blessed
lord
would
i
not
longer
live
if
it
might
please
thee
and
when
he
had
said
these
words
sir
galahad
went
to
sir
perceval
and
to
sir
bohort
and
kissed
them
and
commended
them
to
god
and
then
he
kneeled
down
before
the
table
and
made
his
prayers
and
suddenly
his
soul
departed
and
a
great
multitude
of
angels
bare
his
soul
up
to
heaven
so
as
the
two
fellows
could
well
behold
it
also
they
saw
come
from
heaven
a
hand
but
they
saw
not
the
body
and
the
hand
came
right
to
the
vessel
and
bare
it
up
to
heaven
since
then
was
there
never
one
so
hardy
as
to
say
that
he
had
seen
the
sangreal
on
earth
any
more
chapter
xxii
sir
agrivain
treason
when
sir
perceval
and
sir
bohort
saw
sir
galahad
dead
they
made
as
much
sorrow
as
ever
did
two
men
and
if
they
had
not
been
good
men
they
might
have
fallen
into
despair
as
soon
as
sir
galahad
was
buried
sir
perceval
retired
to
a
hermitage
out
of
the
city
and
took
a
religious
clothing
and
sir
bohort
was
always
with
him
but
did
not
change
his
secular
clothing
because
he
purposed
to
return
to
the
realm
of
loegria
thus
a
year
and
two
months
lived
sir
perceval
in
the
hermitage
a
full
holy
life
and
then
passed
out
of
this
world
and
sir
bohort
buried
him
by
his
sister
and
sir
galahad
then
sir
bohort
armed
himself
and
departed
from
sarras
and
entered
into
a
ship
and
sailed
to
the
kingdom
of
loegria
and
in
due
time
arrived
safe
at
camelot
where
the
king
was
then
was
there
great
joy
made
of
him
in
the
whole
court
for
they
feared
he
had
been
dead
then
the
king
made
great
clerks
to
come
before
him
that
they
should
chronicle
of
the
high
adventures
of
the
good
knights
and
sir
bohort
told
him
of
the
adventures
that
had
befallen
him
and
his
two
fellows
sir
perceval
and
sir
galahad
and
sir
launcelot
told
the
adventures
of
the
sangreal
that
he
had
seen
all
this
was
made
in
great
books
and
put
up
in
the
church
at
salisbury
so
king
arthur
and
queen
guenever
made
great
joy
of
the
remnant
that
were
come
home
and
chiefly
of
sir
launcelot
and
sir
bohort
then
sir
launcelot
began
to
resort
unto
queen
guenever
again
and
forgot
the
promise
that
he
made
in
the
quest
so
that
many
in
the
court
spoke
of
it
and
in
especial
sir
agrivain
sir
brother
for
he
was
ever
so
it
happened
sir
gawain
and
all
his
brothers
were
in
king
arthur
chamber
and
then
sir
agrivain
said
thus
openly
i
marvel
that
we
all
are
not
ashamed
to
see
and
to
know
so
noble
a
knight
as
king
arthur
so
to
be
shamed
by
the
conduct
of
sir
launcelot
and
the
queen
then
spoke
sir
gawain
and
said
brother
sir
agrivain
i
pray
you
and
charge
you
move
not
such
matters
any
more
before
me
for
be
ye
assured
i
will
not
be
of
your
counsel
neither
will
we
said
sir
gaheris
and
sir
gareth
then
will
i
said
sir
modred
i
doubt
you
not
said
sir
gawain
for
to
all
mischief
ever
were
ye
prone
yet
i
would
that
ye
left
all
this
for
i
know
what
will
come
of
it
modred
narrow
foxy
face
smile
and
gray
persistent
eye
henceforward
too
the
powers
that
tend
the
soul
to
help
it
from
the
death
that
can
not
die
and
save
it
even
in
extremes
began
to
vex
and
plague
guinevere
fall
of
it
what
fall
may
said
sir
agrivain
i
will
disclose
it
to
the
king
with
that
came
to
them
king
arthur
now
brothers
hold
your
peace
said
sir
gawain
we
will
not
said
sir
agrivain
then
said
sir
gawain
i
will
not
hear
your
tales
nor
be
of
your
counsel
no
more
will
i
said
sir
gareth
and
sir
gaheris
and
therewith
they
departed
making
great
sorrow
then
sir
agrivain
told
the
king
all
that
was
said
in
the
court
of
the
conduct
of
sir
launcelot
and
the
queen
and
it
grieved
the
king
very
much
but
he
would
not
believe
it
to
be
true
without
proof
so
sir
agrivain
laid
a
plot
to
entrap
sir
launcelot
and
the
queen
intending
to
take
them
together
unawares
sir
agrivain
and
sir
modred
led
a
party
for
this
purpose
but
sir
launcelot
escaped
from
them
having
slain
sir
agrivain
and
wounded
sir
modred
then
sir
launcelot
hastened
to
his
friends
and
told
them
what
had
happened
and
withdrew
with
them
to
the
forest
but
he
left
spies
to
bring
him
tidings
of
whatever
might
be
done
so
sir
launcelot
escaped
but
the
queen
remained
in
the
power
and
arthur
could
no
longer
doubt
of
her
guilt
and
the
law
was
such
in
those
days
that
they
who
committed
such
crimes
of
what
estate
or
condition
soever
they
were
must
be
burned
to
death
and
so
it
was
ordained
for
queen
guenever
then
said
king
arthur
to
sir
gawain
i
pray
you
make
you
ready
in
your
best
armor
with
your
brethren
sir
gaheris
and
sir
gareth
to
bring
my
queen
to
the
fire
there
to
receive
her
death
nay
my
most
noble
lord
said
sir
gawain
that
will
i
never
do
for
know
thou
well
my
heart
will
never
serve
me
to
see
her
die
and
it
shall
never
be
said
that
i
was
of
your
counsel
in
her
death
then
the
king
commanded
sir
gaheris
and
sir
gareth
to
be
there
and
they
said
we
will
be
there
as
ye
command
us
sire
but
in
peaceable
wise
and
bear
no
armor
upon
us
so
the
queen
was
led
forth
and
her
ghostly
father
was
brought
to
her
to
shrive
her
and
there
was
weeping
and
wailing
of
many
lords
and
ladies
and
one
went
and
told
sir
launcelot
that
the
queen
was
led
forth
to
her
death
then
sir
launcelot
and
the
knights
that
were
with
him
fell
upon
the
troop
that
guarded
the
queen
and
dispersed
them
and
slew
all
who
withstood
them
and
in
the
confusion
sir
gareth
and
sir
gaheris
were
slain
for
they
were
unarmed
and
defenceless
and
sir
launcelot
carried
away
the
queen
to
his
castle
of
la
joyeuse
garde
then
there
came
one
to
sir
gawain
and
told
him
how
that
sir
launcelot
had
slain
the
knights
and
carried
away
the
queen
o
lord
defend
my
brethren
said
sir
gawain
truly
said
the
man
sir
gareth
and
sir
gaheris
are
slain
alas
said
sir
gawain
now
is
my
joy
gone
and
then
he
fell
down
and
swooned
and
long
he
lay
there
as
he
had
been
dead
when
he
arose
out
of
his
swoon
sir
gawain
ran
to
the
king
crying
o
king
arthur
mine
uncle
my
brothers
are
slain
then
the
king
wept
and
he
both
my
king
my
lord
and
mine
uncle
said
sir
gawain
bear
witness
now
that
i
make
you
a
promise
that
i
shall
hold
by
my
knighthood
and
from
this
day
i
will
never
fail
sir
launcelot
until
the
one
of
us
have
slain
the
other
i
will
seek
sir
launcelot
throughout
seven
kings
realms
but
i
shall
slay
him
or
he
shall
slay
me
ye
shall
not
need
to
seek
him
said
the
king
for
as
i
hear
sir
launcelot
will
abide
me
and
you
in
the
joyeuse
garde
and
much
people
draweth
unto
him
as
i
hear
say
that
may
i
believe
said
sir
gawain
but
my
lord
summon
your
friends
and
i
will
summon
mine
it
shall
be
done
said
the
king
so
then
the
king
sent
letters
and
writs
throughout
all
england
both
in
the
length
and
breadth
to
summon
all
his
knights
and
unto
arthur
drew
many
knights
dukes
and
earls
so
that
he
had
a
great
host
thereof
heard
sir
launcelot
and
collected
all
whom
he
could
and
many
good
knights
held
with
him
both
for
his
sake
and
for
the
queen
sake
but
king
arthur
host
was
too
great
for
sir
launcelot
to
abide
him
in
the
field
and
he
was
full
loath
to
do
battle
against
the
king
so
sir
launcelot
drew
him
to
his
strong
castle
with
all
manner
of
provisions
then
came
king
arthur
with
sir
gawain
and
laid
siege
all
about
la
joyeuse
garde
both
the
town
and
the
castle
but
in
no
wise
would
sir
launcelot
ride
out
of
his
castle
neither
suffer
any
of
his
knights
to
issue
out
until
many
weeks
were
past
then
it
befell
upon
a
day
in
sir
launcelot
looked
over
the
wall
and
spoke
aloud
to
king
arthur
and
sir
gawain
my
lords
both
all
is
in
vain
that
ye
do
at
this
siege
for
here
ye
shall
win
no
worship
but
only
dishonor
for
if
i
list
to
come
out
and
my
good
knights
i
shall
soon
make
an
end
of
this
war
come
forth
said
arthur
if
thou
darest
and
i
promise
thee
i
shall
meet
thee
in
the
midst
of
the
field
god
forbid
me
said
sir
launcelot
that
i
should
encounter
with
the
most
noble
king
that
made
me
knight
fie
upon
thy
fair
language
said
the
king
for
know
thou
well
i
am
thy
mortal
foe
and
ever
will
be
to
my
dying
day
and
sir
gawain
said
what
cause
hadst
thou
to
slay
my
brother
sir
gaheris
who
bore
no
arms
against
thee
and
sir
gareth
whom
thou
madest
knight
and
who
loved
thee
more
than
all
my
kin
therefore
know
thou
well
i
shall
make
war
to
thee
all
the
while
that
i
may
live
when
sir
bohort
and
sir
hector
de
marys
and
sir
lionel
heard
this
outcry
they
called
to
them
sir
palamedes
and
sir
saffire
his
brother
and
sir
lawayn
with
many
more
and
all
went
to
sir
launcelot
and
they
said
my
lord
sir
launcelot
we
pray
you
if
you
will
have
our
service
keep
us
no
longer
within
these
walls
for
know
well
all
your
fair
speech
and
forbearance
will
not
avail
you
alas
said
sir
launcelot
to
ride
forth
and
to
do
battle
i
am
full
loath
then
he
spake
again
unto
the
king
and
sir
gawain
and
willed
them
to
keep
out
of
the
battle
but
they
despised
his
words
so
then
sir
launcelot
fellowship
came
out
of
the
castle
in
full
good
array
and
always
sir
launcelot
charged
all
his
knights
in
any
wise
to
save
king
arthur
and
sir
gawain
then
came
forth
sir
gawain
from
the
king
host
and
offered
combat
and
sir
lionel
encountered
with
him
and
there
sir
gawain
smote
sir
lionel
through
the
body
that
he
fell
to
the
earth
as
if
dead
then
there
began
a
great
conflict
and
much
people
were
slain
but
ever
sir
launcelot
did
what
he
might
to
save
the
people
on
king
arthur
party
and
ever
king
arthur
followed
sir
launcelot
to
slay
him
but
sir
launcelot
suffered
him
and
would
not
strike
again
then
sir
bohort
encountered
with
king
arthur
and
smote
him
down
and
he
alighted
and
drew
his
sword
and
said
to
sir
launcelot
shall
i
make
an
end
of
this
war
for
he
meant
to
have
slain
king
arthur
not
so
said
sir
launcelot
touch
him
no
more
for
i
will
never
see
that
most
noble
king
that
made
me
knight
either
slain
or
shamed
and
therewith
sir
launcelot
alighted
off
his
horse
and
took
up
the
king
and
horsed
him
again
and
said
thus
my
lord
arthur
for
god
love
cease
this
strife
and
king
arthur
looked
upon
sir
launcelot
and
the
tears
burst
from
his
eyes
thinking
on
the
great
courtesy
that
was
in
sir
launcelot
more
than
in
any
other
man
and
therewith
the
king
rode
his
way
then
anon
both
parties
withdrew
to
repose
them
and
buried
the
dead
but
the
war
continued
and
it
was
noised
abroad
through
all
christendom
and
at
last
it
was
told
afore
the
pope
and
he
considering
the
great
goodness
of
king
arthur
and
of
sir
launcelot
called
unto
him
a
noble
clerk
which
was
the
bishop
of
rochester
who
was
then
in
his
dominions
and
sent
him
to
king
arthur
charging
him
that
he
take
his
queen
dame
guenever
unto
him
again
and
make
peace
with
sir
launcelot
so
by
means
of
this
bishop
peace
was
made
for
the
space
of
one
year
and
king
arthur
received
back
the
queen
and
sir
launcelot
departed
from
the
kingdom
with
all
his
knights
and
went
to
his
own
country
so
they
shipped
at
cardiff
and
sailed
unto
benwick
which
some
men
call
bayonne
and
all
the
people
of
those
lands
came
to
sir
launcelot
and
received
him
home
right
joyfully
and
sir
launcelot
stablished
and
garnished
all
his
towns
and
castles
and
he
greatly
advanced
all
his
noble
knights
sir
lionel
and
sir
bohort
and
sir
hector
de
marys
sir
blamor
sir
lawayne
and
many
others
and
made
them
lords
of
lands
and
castles
till
he
left
himself
no
more
than
any
one
of
them
then
arthur
made
vast
banquets
and
strange
knights
from
the
four
winds
came
in
and
each
one
sat
tho
served
with
choice
from
air
land
stream
and
sea
oft
in
measuring
with
his
eyes
his
neighbor
make
and
might
pelleas
and
ettarre
but
when
the
year
was
passed
king
arthur
and
sir
gawain
came
with
a
great
host
and
landed
upon
sir
launcelot
lands
and
burned
and
wasted
all
that
they
might
overrun
then
spake
sir
bohort
and
said
my
lord
sir
launcelot
give
us
leave
to
meet
them
in
the
field
and
we
shall
make
them
rue
the
time
that
ever
they
came
to
this
country
then
said
sir
launcelot
i
am
full
loath
to
ride
out
with
my
knights
for
shedding
of
christian
blood
so
we
will
yet
a
while
keep
our
walls
and
i
will
send
a
messenger
unto
my
lord
arthur
to
propose
a
treaty
for
better
is
peace
than
always
war
so
sir
launcelot
sent
forth
a
damsel
and
a
dwarf
with
her
requiring
king
arthur
to
leave
his
warring
upon
his
lands
and
so
she
started
on
a
palfrey
and
the
dwarf
ran
by
her
side
and
when
she
came
to
the
pavilion
of
king
arthur
she
alighted
and
there
met
her
a
gentle
knight
sir
lucan
the
butler
and
said
fair
damsel
come
ye
from
sir
launcelot
du
lac
yea
sir
she
said
i
come
hither
to
speak
with
the
king
alas
said
sir
lucan
my
lord
arthur
would
be
reconciled
to
sir
launcelot
but
sir
gawain
will
not
suffer
him
and
with
this
sir
lucan
led
the
damsel
to
the
king
where
he
sat
with
sir
gawain
to
hear
what
she
would
say
so
when
she
had
told
her
tale
the
tears
ran
out
of
the
king
eyes
and
all
the
lords
were
forward
to
advise
the
king
to
be
accorded
with
sir
launcelot
save
only
sir
gawain
and
he
said
my
lord
mine
uncle
what
will
ye
do
will
you
now
turn
back
now
you
are
so
far
advanced
upon
your
journey
if
ye
do
all
the
world
will
speak
shame
of
you
nay
said
king
arthur
i
will
do
as
ye
advise
me
but
do
thou
give
the
damsel
her
answer
for
i
may
not
speak
to
her
for
pity
then
said
sir
gawain
damsel
say
ye
to
sir
launcelot
that
it
is
waste
labor
to
sue
to
mine
uncle
for
peace
and
say
that
i
sir
gawain
send
him
word
that
i
promise
him
by
the
faith
i
owe
unto
god
and
to
knighthood
i
shall
never
leave
him
till
he
have
slain
me
or
i
him
so
the
damsel
returned
and
when
sir
launcelot
had
heard
this
answer
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
then
it
befell
on
a
day
sir
gawain
came
before
the
gates
armed
at
all
points
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
where
art
thou
now
thou
false
traitor
sir
launcelot
why
hidest
thou
thyself
within
holes
and
walls
like
a
coward
look
out
now
thou
traitor
knight
and
i
will
avenge
upon
thy
body
the
death
of
my
three
brethren
all
this
language
heard
sir
launcelot
and
the
knights
which
were
about
him
and
they
said
to
him
sir
launcelot
now
must
ye
defend
you
like
a
knight
or
else
be
shamed
for
ever
for
you
have
slept
overlong
and
suffered
overmuch
then
sir
launcelot
spake
on
high
unto
king
arthur
and
said
my
lord
arthur
now
i
have
forborne
long
and
suffered
you
and
sir
gawain
to
do
what
ye
would
and
now
must
i
needs
defend
myself
inasmuch
as
sir
gawain
hath
appealed
me
of
treason
then
sir
launcelot
armed
him
and
mounted
upon
his
horse
and
the
noble
knights
came
out
of
the
city
and
the
host
without
stood
all
apart
and
so
the
covenant
was
made
that
no
man
should
come
near
the
two
knights
nor
deal
with
them
till
one
were
dead
or
yielded
then
sir
launcelot
and
sir
gawain
departed
a
great
way
asunder
and
then
they
came
together
with
all
their
horses
might
and
each
smote
the
other
in
the
middle
of
their
shields
but
neither
of
them
was
unhorsed
but
their
horses
fell
to
the
earth
and
then
they
leapt
from
their
horses
and
drew
their
swords
and
gave
many
sad
strokes
so
that
the
blood
burst
out
in
many
places
now
sir
gawain
had
this
gift
from
a
holy
man
that
every
day
in
the
year
from
morning
to
noon
his
strength
was
increased
threefold
and
then
it
fell
again
to
its
natural
measure
sir
launcelot
was
aware
of
this
and
therefore
during
the
three
hours
that
sir
strength
was
at
the
height
sir
launcelot
covered
himself
with
his
shield
and
kept
his
might
in
reserve
and
during
that
time
sir
gawain
gave
him
many
sad
brunts
that
all
the
knights
that
looked
on
marvelled
how
sir
launcelot
might
endure
them
then
when
it
was
past
noon
sir
gawain
had
only
his
own
might
and
when
sir
launcelot
felt
him
so
brought
down
he
stretched
himself
up
and
doubled
his
strokes
and
gave
sir
gawain
such
a
buffet
that
he
fell
down
on
his
side
and
sir
launcelot
drew
back
and
would
strike
no
more
why
withdrawest
thou
false
traitor
then
said
sir
gawain
now
turn
again
and
slay
me
for
if
thou
leave
me
thus
when
i
am
whole
again
i
shall
do
battle
with
thee
again
i
shall
endure
you
sir
by
god
grace
said
sir
launcelot
but
know
thou
well
sir
gawain
i
will
never
smite
a
felled
knight
and
so
sir
launcelot
went
into
the
city
and
sir
gawain
was
borne
into
king
arthur
pavilion
and
his
wounds
were
looked
to
thus
the
siege
endured
and
sir
gawain
lay
helpless
near
a
month
and
when
he
was
near
recovered
came
tidings
unto
king
arthur
that
made
him
return
with
all
his
host
to
england
chapter
xxiii
morte
sir
modred
was
left
ruler
of
all
england
and
he
caused
letters
to
be
written
as
if
from
beyond
sea
that
king
arthur
was
slain
in
battle
so
he
called
a
parliament
and
made
himself
be
crowned
king
and
he
took
the
queen
guenever
and
said
plainly
that
he
would
wed
her
but
she
escaped
from
him
and
took
refuge
in
the
tower
of
london
and
sir
modred
went
and
laid
siege
about
the
tower
of
london
and
made
great
assaults
thereat
but
all
might
not
avail
him
then
came
word
to
sir
modred
that
king
arthur
had
raised
the
siege
of
sir
launcelot
and
was
coming
home
then
sir
modred
summoned
all
the
barony
of
the
land
and
much
people
drew
unto
sir
modred
and
said
they
would
abide
with
him
for
better
and
for
worse
and
he
drew
a
great
host
to
dover
for
there
he
heard
say
that
king
arthur
would
arrive
i
hear
the
steps
of
modred
in
the
west
and
with
him
many
of
thy
people
and
knights
once
thine
whom
thou
hast
loved
but
grosser
grown
than
heathen
spitting
at
their
vows
and
thee
the
passing
of
arthur
and
as
sir
modred
was
at
dover
with
his
host
came
king
arthur
with
a
great
number
of
ships
and
galleys
and
there
was
sir
modred
awaiting
upon
the
landing
then
was
there
launching
of
great
boats
and
small
full
of
noble
men
of
arms
and
there
was
much
slaughter
of
gentle
knights
on
both
parts
but
king
arthur
was
so
courageous
there
might
no
manner
of
knights
prevent
him
to
land
and
his
knights
fiercely
followed
him
and
so
they
landed
and
put
sir
modred
aback
so
that
he
fled
and
all
his
people
and
when
the
battle
was
done
king
arthur
commanded
to
bury
his
people
that
were
dead
and
then
was
noble
sir
gawain
found
in
a
great
boat
lying
more
than
half
dead
and
king
arthur
went
to
him
and
made
sorrow
out
of
measure
mine
uncle
said
sir
gawain
know
thou
well
my
is
come
and
all
is
through
mine
own
hastiness
and
wilfulness
for
i
am
smitten
upon
the
old
wound
which
sir
launcelot
gave
me
of
which
i
feel
i
must
die
and
had
sir
launcelot
been
with
you
as
of
old
this
war
had
never
begun
and
of
all
this
i
am
the
cause
then
sir
gawain
prayed
the
king
to
send
for
sir
launcelot
and
to
cherish
him
above
all
other
knights
and
so
at
the
hour
of
noon
sir
gawain
yielded
up
his
spirit
and
then
the
king
bade
inter
him
in
a
chapel
within
dover
castle
and
there
all
men
may
see
the
skull
of
him
and
the
same
wound
is
seen
that
sir
launcelot
gave
him
in
battle
then
was
it
told
the
king
that
sir
modred
had
pitched
his
camp
upon
barrendown
and
the
king
rode
thither
and
there
was
a
great
battle
betwixt
them
and
king
arthur
party
stood
best
and
sir
modred
and
his
party
fled
unto
canterbury
and
there
was
a
day
assigned
betwixt
king
arthur
and
sir
modred
that
they
should
meet
upon
a
down
beside
salisbury
and
not
far
from
the
to
do
battle
yet
again
and
at
night
as
the
king
slept
he
dreamed
a
wonderful
dream
it
seemed
him
verily
that
there
came
sir
gawain
unto
him
with
a
number
of
fair
ladies
with
him
and
when
king
arthur
saw
him
he
said
welcome
my
sister
son
i
weened
thou
hadst
been
dead
and
now
i
see
thee
alive
great
is
my
joy
but
o
fair
nephew
what
be
these
ladies
that
hither
be
come
with
you
sir
said
sir
gawain
all
these
be
ladies
for
whom
i
have
fought
when
i
was
a
living
man
and
because
i
did
battle
for
them
in
righteous
quarrel
they
have
given
me
grace
to
bring
me
hither
unto
you
to
warn
you
of
your
death
if
ye
fight
with
sir
modred
therefore
take
ye
treaty
and
proffer
you
largely
for
a
month
delay
for
within
a
month
shall
come
sir
launcelot
and
all
his
noble
knights
and
rescue
you
worshipfully
and
slay
sir
modred
and
all
that
hold
with
him
and
then
sir
gawain
and
all
the
ladies
vanished
and
anon
the
king
called
to
fetch
his
noble
lords
and
wise
bishops
unto
him
and
when
they
were
come
the
king
told
them
his
vision
and
what
sir
gawain
had
told
him
then
the
king
sent
sir
lucan
the
butler
and
sir
bedivere
with
two
bishops
and
charged
them
in
any
wise
to
take
a
treaty
for
a
month
and
a
day
with
sir
modred
so
they
departed
and
came
to
sir
modred
and
so
at
the
last
sir
modred
was
agreed
to
have
cornwall
and
kent
during
arthur
life
and
all
england
after
his
death
sir
modred
he
the
nearest
to
the
king
his
nephew
ever
like
a
subtle
beast
lay
couchant
with
his
eyes
upon
the
throne
ready
to
spring
waiting
a
chance
guinevere
then
was
it
agreed
that
king
arthur
and
sir
modred
should
meet
betwixt
both
their
hosts
and
each
of
them
should
bring
fourteen
persons
and
then
and
there
they
should
sign
the
treaty
and
when
king
arthur
and
his
knights
were
prepared
to
go
forth
he
warned
all
his
host
if
so
be
ye
see
any
sword
drawn
look
ye
come
on
fiercely
and
slay
whomsoever
withstandeth
for
i
in
no
wise
trust
that
traitor
sir
modred
in
like
wise
sir
modred
warned
his
host
so
they
met
and
were
agreed
and
accorded
thoroughly
and
wine
was
brought
and
they
drank
right
then
came
an
adder
out
of
a
little
and
stung
a
knight
on
the
foot
and
when
the
knight
felt
him
sting
he
looked
down
and
saw
the
adder
and
then
he
drew
his
sword
to
slay
the
adder
and
thought
of
no
other
harm
and
when
the
host
on
both
sides
saw
that
sword
drawn
they
blew
trumpets
and
horns
and
shouted
greatly
and
king
arthur
took
his
horse
and
rode
to
his
party
saying
alas
this
unhappy
day
and
sir
modred
did
in
like
wise
and
never
was
there
a
more
doleful
battle
in
christian
land
and
ever
king
arthur
rode
throughout
the
battle
and
did
full
nobly
as
a
worthy
king
should
and
sir
modred
that
day
did
his
devoir
and
put
himself
in
great
peril
and
thus
they
fought
all
the
long
day
till
the
most
of
all
the
noble
knights
lay
dead
upon
the
ground
then
the
king
looked
about
him
and
saw
of
all
his
host
were
left
alive
but
two
knights
sir
lucan
the
butler
and
sir
bedivere
his
brother
and
they
were
full
sore
wounded
then
king
arthur
saw
where
sir
modred
leaned
upon
his
sword
among
a
great
heap
of
dead
men
now
give
me
my
spear
said
arthur
unto
sir
lucan
for
yonder
i
espy
the
traitor
that
hast
wrought
all
this
woe
sir
let
him
be
said
sir
lucan
for
if
ye
pass
this
unhappy
day
ye
shall
be
right
well
revenged
upon
him
remember
what
the
sprite
of
sir
gawain
told
you
and
leave
off
now
for
ye
have
won
the
field
and
if
ye
leave
off
now
this
evil
day
of
destiny
is
past
betide
me
life
betide
me
death
said
king
arthur
he
shall
not
now
escape
my
hands
then
the
king
took
his
spear
in
both
hands
and
ran
toward
sir
modred
crying
traitor
now
is
thy
come
and
there
king
arthur
smote
sir
modred
under
the
shield
with
a
thrust
of
his
spear
through
the
body
and
when
sir
modred
felt
that
he
had
his
with
the
might
that
he
had
he
smote
king
arthur
with
his
sword
holden
in
both
his
hands
on
the
side
of
the
head
that
the
sword
pierced
the
helmet
and
the
and
then
sir
modred
fell
stark
dead
upon
the
earth
and
the
noble
arthur
fell
in
a
swoon
to
the
earth
and
sir
lucan
the
butler
and
sir
bedivere
raised
him
up
and
gently
led
him
betwixt
them
both
to
a
little
chapel
not
far
from
the
and
when
the
king
was
there
he
thought
him
well
eased
then
heard
they
people
cry
in
the
field
and
sir
lucan
went
to
see
what
that
cry
betokened
and
he
saw
by
the
moonlight
that
pillers
and
robbers
were
come
to
rob
the
dead
and
he
returned
and
said
to
the
king
by
my
rede
it
is
best
that
we
bring
you
to
some
town
i
would
it
were
so
said
the
king
and
when
the
king
tried
to
go
he
fainted
then
sir
lucan
took
up
the
king
on
the
one
part
and
sir
bedivere
on
the
other
part
and
in
the
lifting
sir
lucan
fell
in
a
swoon
to
the
earth
for
he
was
grievously
wounded
and
then
the
noble
knight
heart
burst
and
when
the
king
awoke
he
beheld
sir
lucan
how
he
lay
foaming
at
the
mouth
and
speechless
alas
said
the
king
this
is
to
me
a
full
heavy
sight
to
see
this
noble
duke
so
die
for
my
sake
for
he
would
have
holpen
me
that
had
more
need
of
help
than
i
and
he
would
not
complain
his
heart
was
so
set
to
help
me
then
sir
bedivere
wept
for
his
brother
leave
this
mourning
and
weeping
said
the
king
for
wilt
thou
well
if
i
might
live
myself
the
death
of
sir
lucan
would
grieve
me
evermore
but
my
time
hieth
fast
therefore
said
arthur
unto
sir
bedivere
take
thou
excalibar
my
good
sword
and
go
with
it
to
yonder
and
when
thou
comest
there
i
charge
thee
throw
my
sword
in
that
water
and
come
again
and
tell
me
what
thou
there
seest
my
lord
said
sir
bedivere
your
commandment
shall
be
done
so
sir
bedivere
departed
and
by
the
way
he
beheld
that
noble
sword
that
the
pommel
and
the
haft
were
all
of
precious
stones
and
then
he
said
to
himself
if
i
throw
this
rich
sword
into
the
water
no
good
shall
come
thereof
but
only
harm
and
loss
and
then
sir
bedivere
hid
excalibar
under
a
tree
and
so
as
soon
as
he
might
he
came
again
to
the
king
what
sawest
thou
there
said
the
king
sir
he
said
i
saw
nothing
alas
thou
hast
deceived
me
said
the
king
go
thou
lightly
again
and
as
thou
love
me
spare
not
to
throw
it
in
then
sir
bedivere
went
again
and
took
the
sword
in
his
hand
to
throw
it
but
again
it
beseemed
him
but
sin
and
shame
to
throw
away
that
noble
sword
and
he
hid
it
away
again
and
returned
and
told
the
king
he
had
done
his
commandment
what
sawest
thou
there
said
the
king
sir
he
said
i
saw
nothing
but
waters
deep
and
waves
wan
ah
traitor
untrue
said
king
arthur
now
hast
thou
betrayed
me
twice
and
yet
thou
art
named
a
noble
knight
and
hast
been
lief
and
dear
to
me
but
now
go
again
and
do
as
i
bid
thee
for
thy
long
tarrying
putteth
me
in
jeopardy
of
my
life
then
sir
bedivere
went
to
the
sword
and
lightly
took
it
up
and
went
to
the
and
he
bound
the
girdle
about
the
hilt
and
then
he
threw
the
sword
as
far
into
the
water
as
he
might
and
there
came
an
arm
and
a
hand
out
of
the
water
and
met
it
and
caught
it
and
shook
it
thrice
and
brandished
it
and
then
vanished
away
the
hand
with
the
sword
in
the
water
then
sir
bedivere
came
again
to
the
king
and
told
him
what
he
saw
help
me
hence
said
the
king
for
i
fear
i
have
tarried
too
long
then
sir
bedivere
took
the
king
on
his
back
and
so
went
with
him
to
that
and
when
they
came
there
even
fast
by
the
bank
there
rode
a
little
barge
with
many
fair
ladies
in
it
and
among
them
was
a
queen
and
all
had
black
hoods
and
they
wept
and
shrieked
when
they
saw
king
arthur
now
put
me
in
the
barge
said
the
king
and
there
received
him
three
queens
with
great
mourning
and
in
one
of
their
laps
king
arthur
laid
his
head
and
the
queen
said
ah
dear
brother
why
have
ye
tarried
so
long
alas
this
wound
on
your
head
hath
caught
cold
and
then
they
rowed
from
the
land
and
sir
bedivere
beheld
them
go
from
him
then
he
cried
ah
my
lord
arthur
will
ye
leave
me
here
alone
among
mine
enemies
comfort
thyself
said
the
king
for
in
me
is
no
further
help
for
i
will
to
the
isle
of
avalon
to
heal
me
of
my
grievous
wound
and
as
soon
as
sir
bedivere
had
lost
sight
of
the
barge
he
wept
and
wailed
then
he
took
the
forest
and
went
all
that
night
and
in
the
morning
he
was
ware
of
a
chapel
and
a
hermitage
then
went
sir
bedivere
thither
and
when
he
came
into
the
chapel
he
saw
where
lay
an
hermit
on
the
ground
near
a
tomb
that
was
newly
graven
sir
said
sir
bedivere
what
man
is
there
buried
that
ye
pray
so
near
unto
fair
son
said
the
hermit
i
know
not
verily
but
this
night
there
came
a
number
of
ladies
and
brought
hither
one
dead
and
prayed
me
to
bury
him
alas
said
sir
bedivere
that
was
my
lord
king
arthur
then
sir
bedivere
swooned
and
when
he
awoke
he
prayed
the
hermit
he
might
abide
with
him
to
live
with
fasting
and
prayers
ye
are
welcome
said
the
hermit
so
there
bode
sir
bedivere
with
the
hermit
and
he
put
on
poor
clothes
and
served
the
hermit
full
lowly
in
fasting
and
in
prayers
thus
of
arthur
i
find
never
more
written
in
books
that
be
authorized
nor
more
of
the
very
certainty
of
his
death
but
thus
was
he
led
away
in
a
ship
wherein
were
three
queens
the
one
was
king
arthur
sister
queen
morgane
le
fay
the
other
was
viviane
the
lady
of
the
lake
and
the
third
was
the
queen
of
north
galis
and
this
tale
sir
bedivere
knight
of
the
table
round
made
to
be
written
yet
some
men
say
that
king
arthur
is
not
dead
but
hid
away
into
another
place
and
men
say
that
he
shall
come
again
and
reign
over
england
but
many
say
that
there
is
written
on
his
tomb
this
verse
hie
facet
arthurus
rex
quondam
rexque
futurus
here
arthur
lies
king
once
and
king
to
be
and
when
queen
guenever
understood
that
king
arthur
was
slain
and
all
the
noble
knights
with
him
she
stole
away
and
five
ladies
with
her
and
so
she
went
to
almesbury
and
made
herself
a
nun
and
ware
white
clothes
and
black
and
took
great
penance
as
ever
did
sinful
lady
and
lived
in
fasting
prayers
and
and
there
she
was
abbess
and
ruler
of
the
nuns
and
when
she
came
to
almesbury
she
spake
there
to
the
nuns
and
said
enemies
pursue
me
but
o
peaceful
sisterhood
receive
and
yield
me
sanctuary
nor
ask
her
name
to
whom
ye
yield
it
till
her
time
to
tell
you
and
her
beauty
grace
and
power
wrought
as
a
charm
upon
them
and
they
spared
to
ask
it
guinevere
now
turn
we
from
her
and
speak
of
sir
launcelot
of
the
lake
when
sir
launcelot
heard
in
his
country
that
sir
modred
was
crowned
king
of
england
and
made
war
against
his
own
uncle
king
arthur
then
was
sir
launcelot
wroth
out
of
measure
and
said
to
his
kinsmen
alas
that
double
traitor
sir
modred
now
it
repenteth
me
that
ever
he
escaped
out
of
my
hands
then
sir
launcelot
and
his
fellows
made
ready
in
all
haste
with
ships
and
galleys
to
pass
into
england
and
so
he
passed
over
till
he
came
to
dover
and
there
he
landed
with
a
great
army
then
sir
launcelot
was
told
that
king
arthur
was
slain
alas
said
sir
launcelot
this
is
the
heaviest
tidings
that
ever
came
to
me
then
he
called
the
kings
dukes
barons
and
knights
and
said
thus
my
fair
lords
i
thank
you
all
for
coming
into
this
country
with
me
but
we
came
too
late
and
that
shall
repent
me
while
i
live
but
since
it
is
so
said
sir
launcelot
i
will
myself
ride
and
seek
my
lady
queen
guenever
for
i
have
heard
say
she
hath
fled
into
the
west
therefore
ye
shall
abide
me
here
fifteen
days
and
if
i
come
not
within
that
time
then
take
your
ships
and
your
host
and
depart
into
your
country
so
sir
launcelot
departed
and
rode
westerly
and
there
he
sought
many
days
and
at
last
he
came
to
a
nunnery
and
was
seen
of
queen
guenever
as
he
walked
in
the
cloister
and
when
she
saw
him
she
swooned
away
and
when
she
might
speak
she
bade
him
to
be
called
to
her
and
when
sir
launcelot
was
brought
to
her
she
said
sir
launcelot
i
require
thee
and
beseech
thee
for
all
the
love
that
ever
was
betwixt
us
that
thou
never
see
me
more
but
return
to
thy
kingdom
and
take
thee
a
wife
and
live
with
her
with
joy
and
bliss
and
pray
for
me
to
my
lord
that
i
may
get
my
health
nay
madam
said
sir
launcelot
wit
you
well
that
i
shall
never
do
but
the
same
destiny
that
ye
have
taken
you
to
will
i
take
me
unto
for
to
please
and
serve
god
and
so
they
parted
with
tears
and
much
lamentation
and
the
ladies
bare
the
queen
to
her
chamber
and
sir
launcelot
took
his
horse
and
rode
away
weeping
and
at
last
sir
launcelot
was
ware
of
a
hermitage
and
a
chapel
and
then
he
heard
a
little
bell
ring
to
mass
and
thither
he
rode
and
alighted
and
tied
his
horse
to
the
gate
and
heard
mass
and
he
that
sang
the
mass
was
the
hermit
with
whom
sir
bedivere
had
taken
up
his
abode
and
sir
bedivere
knew
sir
launcelot
and
they
spake
together
after
mass
but
when
sir
bedivere
had
told
his
tale
sir
launcelot
heart
almost
burst
for
sorrow
then
he
kneeled
down
and
prayed
the
hermit
to
shrive
him
and
besought
that
he
might
be
his
brother
then
the
hermit
said
i
will
gladly
and
then
he
put
a
habit
upon
sir
launcelot
and
there
he
served
god
day
and
night
with
prayers
and
fastings
and
the
great
host
abode
at
dover
till
the
end
of
the
fifteen
days
set
by
sir
launcelot
and
then
sir
bohort
made
them
to
go
home
again
to
their
own
country
and
sir
bohort
sir
hector
de
marys
sir
blamor
and
many
others
took
on
them
to
ride
through
all
england
to
seek
sir
launcelot
so
sir
bohort
by
fortune
rode
until
he
came
to
the
same
chapel
where
sir
launcelot
was
and
when
he
saw
sir
launcelot
in
that
manner
of
clothing
he
prayed
the
hermit
that
he
might
be
in
that
same
and
so
there
was
an
habit
put
upon
him
and
there
he
lived
in
prayers
and
fasting
and
within
half
a
year
came
others
of
the
knights
their
fellows
and
took
such
a
habit
as
sir
launcelot
and
sir
bohort
had
thus
they
endured
in
great
penance
six
years
and
upon
a
night
there
came
a
vision
to
sir
launcelot
and
charged
him
to
haste
toward
almesbury
and
by
the
time
thou
come
there
thou
shalt
find
queen
guenever
dead
then
sir
launcelot
rose
up
early
and
told
the
hermit
thereof
then
said
the
hermit
it
were
well
that
ye
disobey
not
this
vision
and
sir
launcelot
took
his
seven
companions
with
him
and
on
foot
they
went
from
glastonbury
to
almesbury
which
is
more
than
thirty
miles
and
when
they
were
come
to
almesbury
they
found
that
queen
guenever
died
but
half
an
hour
before
then
sir
launcelot
saw
her
visage
but
he
wept
not
greatly
but
sighed
and
so
he
did
all
the
observance
of
the
service
himself
both
the
dirige
at
night
and
at
morn
he
sang
mass
and
there
was
prepared
an
and
sir
launcelot
and
his
fellows
followed
the
bier
on
foot
from
almesbury
until
they
came
to
glastonbury
and
she
was
wrapped
in
cered
clothes
and
laid
in
a
coffin
of
marble
and
when
she
was
put
in
the
earth
sir
launcelot
swooned
and
lay
long
as
one
dead
and
sir
launcelot
never
after
ate
but
little
meat
nor
drank
but
continually
mourned
and
within
six
weeks
sir
launcelot
fell
sick
and
he
sent
for
the
hermit
and
all
his
true
fellows
and
said
sir
hermit
i
pray
you
give
me
all
my
rights
that
a
christian
man
ought
to
have
it
shall
not
need
said
the
hermit
and
all
his
fellows
it
is
but
heaviness
of
your
blood
and
morn
you
shall
be
well
my
fair
lords
said
sir
launcelot
my
careful
body
will
into
the
earth
i
have
warning
more
than
now
i
will
say
therefore
give
me
my
rights
so
when
he
was
houseled
and
aneled
and
had
all
that
a
christian
man
ought
to
have
he
prayed
the
hermit
that
his
fellows
might
bear
his
body
to
joyous
garde
some
men
say
it
was
alnwick
and
some
say
it
was
bamborough
it
repenteth
me
sore
said
sir
launcelot
but
i
made
a
vow
aforetime
that
in
joyous
garde
i
would
be
buried
then
there
was
weeping
and
wringing
of
hands
among
his
fellows
and
that
night
sir
launcelot
died
and
when
sir
bohort
and
his
fellows
came
to
his
bedside
the
next
morning
they
found
him
stark
dead
and
he
lay
as
if
he
had
smiled
and
the
sweetest
savor
all
about
him
that
ever
they
knew
and
they
put
sir
launcelot
into
the
same
that
queen
guenever
was
laid
in
and
the
hermit
and
they
altogether
went
with
the
body
till
they
came
to
joyous
garde
and
there
they
laid
his
corpse
in
the
body
of
the
quire
and
sang
and
read
many
psalms
and
prayers
over
him
and
ever
his
visage
was
laid
open
and
naked
that
all
folks
might
behold
him
and
right
thus
as
they
were
at
their
service
there
came
sir
hector
de
maris
that
had
seven
years
sought
sir
launcelot
his
brother
through
all
england
scotland
and
wales
and
when
sir
hector
heard
such
sounds
in
the
chapel
of
joyous
garde
he
alighted
and
came
into
the
quire
and
all
they
knew
sir
hector
then
went
sir
bohort
and
told
him
how
there
lay
sir
launcelot
his
brother
dead
then
sir
hector
threw
his
shield
his
sword
and
helm
from
him
and
when
he
beheld
sir
launcelot
visage
it
were
hard
for
any
tongue
to
tell
the
doleful
complaints
he
made
for
his
brother
ah
sir
launcelot
he
said
there
thou
liest
and
now
i
dare
to
say
thou
wert
never
matched
of
none
earthly
knight
hand
and
thou
wert
the
courteousest
knight
that
ever
bare
shield
and
thou
wert
the
truest
friend
to
thy
lover
that
ever
bestrode
horse
and
thou
wert
the
truest
lover
of
a
sinful
man
that
ever
loved
woman
and
thou
wert
the
kindest
man
that
ever
struck
with
sword
and
thou
wert
the
goodliest
person
that
ever
came
among
press
of
knights
and
thou
wert
the
meekest
man
and
the
gentlest
that
ever
ate
in
hall
among
ladies
and
thou
wert
the
sternest
knight
to
thy
mortal
foe
that
ever
put
spear
in
the
rest
then
there
was
weeping
and
dolor
out
of
measure
thus
they
kept
sir
launcelot
corpse
fifteen
days
and
then
they
buried
it
with
great
devotion
then
they
went
back
with
the
hermit
to
his
hermitage
and
sir
bedivere
was
there
ever
still
hermit
to
his
life
end
and
sir
bohort
sir
hector
sir
blamor
and
sir
bleoberis
went
into
the
holy
land
and
these
four
knights
did
many
battles
upon
the
miscreants
the
turks
and
there
they
died
upon
a
good
friday
as
it
pleased
god
thus
endeth
this
noble
and
joyous
book
entitled
la
morte
notwithstanding
it
treateth
of
the
birth
life
and
acts
of
the
said
king
arthur
and
of
his
noble
knights
of
the
round
table
their
marvellous
enquests
and
adventures
the
achieving
of
the
sangreal
and
in
the
end
le
morte
with
the
dolorous
death
and
departing
out
of
this
world
of
them
all
which
book
was
reduced
into
english
by
sir
thomas
mallory
knight
and
divided
into
books
chaptered
and
imprinted
and
finished
in
the
abbey
westmestre
the
last
day
of
july
the
year
of
our
lord

fieri
fecit
the
mabinogeon
introductory
note
it
has
been
well
known
to
the
literati
and
antiquarians
of
europe
that
there
exist
in
the
great
public
libraries
voluminous
manuscripts
of
romances
and
tales
once
popular
but
which
on
the
invention
of
printing
had
already
become
antiquated
and
fallen
into
neglect
they
were
therefore
never
printed
and
seldom
perused
even
by
the
learned
until
about
half
a
century
ago
when
attention
was
again
directed
to
them
and
they
were
found
very
curious
monuments
of
ancient
manners
habits
and
modes
of
thinking
several
have
since
been
edited
some
by
individuals
as
sir
walter
scott
and
the
poet
southey
others
by
antiquarian
societies
the
class
of
readers
which
could
be
counted
on
for
such
publications
was
so
small
that
no
inducement
of
profit
could
be
found
to
tempt
editors
and
publishers
to
give
them
to
the
world
it
was
therefore
only
a
few
and
those
the
most
accessible
which
were
put
in
print
there
was
a
class
of
manuscripts
of
this
kind
which
were
known
or
rather
suspected
to
be
both
curious
and
valuable
but
which
it
seemed
almost
hopeless
to
expect
ever
to
see
in
fair
printed
english
these
were
the
welsh
popular
tales
called
mabinogeon
a
plural
word
the
singular
being
mabinogi
a
tale
manuscripts
of
these
were
contained
in
the
bodleian
library
at
oxford
and
elsewhere
but
the
difficulty
was
to
find
translators
and
editors
the
welsh
is
a
spoken
language
among
the
peasantry
of
wales
but
is
entirely
neglected
by
the
learned
unless
they
are
natives
of
the
principality
of
the
few
welsh
scholars
none
were
found
who
took
sufficient
interest
in
this
branch
of
learning
to
give
these
productions
to
the
english
public
southey
and
scott
and
others
who
like
them
loved
the
old
romantic
legends
of
their
country
often
urged
upon
the
welsh
literati
the
duty
of
reproducing
the
mabinogeon
southey
in
the
preface
of
his
edition
of
says
the
specimens
which
i
have
seen
are
exceedingly
curious
nor
is
there
a
greater
desideratum
in
british
literature
than
an
edition
of
these
tales
with
a
literal
version
and
such
comments
as
davies
of
all
men
is
best
qualified
to
give
certain
it
is
that
many
of
the
round
table
fictions
originated
in
wales
or
in
bretagne
and
probably
might
still
be
traced
there
again
in
a
letter
to
sir
charles
wynn
dated
he
says
i
begin
almost
to
despair
of
ever
seeing
more
of
the
mabinogeon
and
yet
if
some
competent
welshman
could
be
found
to
edit
it
carefully
with
as
literal
a
version
as
possible
i
am
sure
it
might
be
made
worth
his
while
by
a
subscription
printing
a
small
edition
at
a
high
price
perhaps
two
hundred
at
five
guineas
i
myself
would
gladly
subscribe
at
that
price
per
volume
for
such
an
edition
of
the
whole
of
your
genuine
remains
in
prose
and
verse
till
some
such
collection
is
made
the
of
wales
ought
to
be
prohibited
from
wearing
a
leek
ay
and
interdicted
from
toasted
cheese
also
your
bards
would
have
met
with
better
usage
if
they
had
been
scotchmen
sharon
turner
and
sir
walter
scott
also
expressed
a
similar
wish
for
the
publication
of
the
welsh
manuscripts
the
former
took
part
in
an
attempt
to
effect
it
through
the
instrumentality
of
a
owen
a
welshman
but
we
judge
by
what
southey
says
of
him
imperfectly
acquainted
with
english
southey
language
is
william
owen
lent
me
three
parts
of
the
mabinogeon
delightfully
translated
into
so
welsh
an
idiom
and
syntax
that
such
a
translation
is
as
instructive
as
an
original
in
another
letter
he
adds
let
sharon
make
his
language
grammatical
but
not
alter
their
idiom
in
the
slightest
point
it
is
probable
owen
did
not
proceed
far
in
an
undertaking
which
so
executed
could
expect
but
little
popular
patronage
it
was
not
till
an
individual
should
appear
possessed
of
the
requisite
knowledge
of
the
two
languages
of
enthusiasm
sufficient
for
the
task
and
of
pecuniary
resources
sufficient
to
be
independent
of
the
booksellers
and
of
the
reading
public
that
such
a
work
could
be
confidently
expected
such
an
individual
has
since
southey
day
and
scott
appeared
in
the
person
of
lady
charlotte
guest
an
english
lady
united
to
a
gentleman
of
property
in
wales
who
having
acquired
the
language
of
the
principality
and
become
enthusiastically
fond
of
its
literary
treasures
has
given
them
to
the
english
reader
in
a
dress
which
the
and
the
engraver
arts
have
done
their
best
to
adorn
in
four
royal
octavo
volumes
containing
the
welsh
originals
the
translation
and
ample
illustrations
from
french
german
and
other
contemporary
and
affiliated
literature
the
mabinogeon
is
spread
before
us
to
the
antiquarian
and
the
student
of
language
and
ethnology
an
invaluable
treasure
it
yet
can
hardly
in
such
a
form
win
its
way
to
popular
acquaintance
we
claim
no
other
merit
than
that
of
bringing
it
to
the
knowledge
of
our
readers
of
abridging
its
details
of
selecting
its
most
attractive
portions
and
of
faithfully
preserving
throughout
the
style
in
which
lady
guest
has
clothed
her
legends
for
this
service
we
hope
that
our
readers
will
confess
we
have
laid
them
under
no
light
obligation
chapter
i
the
britons
the
earliest
inhabitants
of
britain
are
supposed
to
have
been
a
branch
of
that
great
family
known
in
history
by
the
designation
of
celts
cambria
which
is
a
frequent
name
for
wales
is
thought
to
be
derived
from
cymri
the
name
which
the
welsh
traditions
apply
to
an
immigrant
people
who
entered
the
island
from
the
adjacent
continent
this
name
is
thought
to
be
identical
with
those
of
cimmerians
and
cimbri
under
which
the
greek
and
roman
historians
describe
a
barbarous
people
who
spread
themselves
from
the
north
of
the
euxine
over
the
whole
of
northwestern
europe
the
origin
of
the
names
wales
and
welsh
has
been
much
canvassed
some
writers
make
them
a
derivation
from
gael
or
gaul
which
names
are
said
to
signify
woodlanders
others
observe
that
walsh
in
the
northern
languages
signifies
a
stranger
and
that
the
aboriginal
britons
were
so
called
by
those
who
at
a
later
era
invaded
the
island
and
possessed
the
greater
part
of
it
the
saxons
and
angles
the
romans
held
britain
from
the
invasion
of
julius
caesar
till
their
voluntary
withdrawal
from
the
island
that
is
about
five
hundred
years
in
that
time
there
must
have
been
a
wide
diffusion
of
their
arts
and
institutions
among
the
natives
the
remains
of
roads
cities
and
fortifications
show
that
they
did
much
to
develop
and
improve
the
country
while
those
of
their
villas
and
castles
prove
that
many
of
the
settlers
possessed
wealth
and
taste
for
the
ornamental
arts
yet
the
roman
sway
was
sustained
chiefly
by
force
and
never
extended
over
the
entire
island
the
northern
portion
now
scotland
remained
independent
and
the
western
portion
constituting
wales
and
cornwall
was
only
nominally
subjected
neither
did
the
later
invading
hordes
succeed
in
subduing
the
remoter
sections
of
the
island
for
ages
after
the
arrival
of
the
saxons
under
hengist
and
horsa
the
whole
western
coast
of
britain
was
possessed
by
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
engaged
in
constant
warfare
with
the
invaders
it
has
therefore
been
a
favorite
boast
of
the
people
of
wales
and
cornwall
that
the
original
british
stock
flourishes
in
its
unmixed
purity
only
among
them
we
see
this
notion
flashing
out
in
poetry
occasionally
as
when
gray
in
the
bard
prophetically
describing
queen
elizabeth
who
was
of
the
tudor
a
welsh
race
says
her
eye
proclaims
her
of
the
briton
line
and
contrasting
the
princes
of
the
tudor
with
those
of
the
norman
race
he
exclaims
all
hail
ye
genuine
kings
britannia
issue
hail
the
welsh
language
and
literature
the
welsh
language
is
one
of
the
oldest
in
europe
it
possesses
poems
the
origin
of
which
is
referred
with
probability
to
the
sixth
century
the
language
of
some
of
these
is
so
antiquated
that
the
best
scholars
differ
about
the
interpretation
of
many
passages
but
generally
speaking
the
body
of
poetry
which
the
welsh
possess
from
the
year
downwards
is
intelligible
to
those
who
are
acquainted
with
the
modern
language
till
within
the
last
these
compositions
remained
buried
in
the
libraries
of
colleges
or
of
individuals
and
so
difficult
of
access
that
no
successful
attempt
was
made
to
give
them
to
the
world
this
reproach
was
removed
after
ineffectual
appeals
to
the
patriotism
of
the
gentry
of
wales
by
owen
jones
a
furrier
of
london
who
at
his
own
expense
collected
and
published
the
chief
productions
of
welsh
literature
under
the
title
of
the
myvyrian
archaeology
of
wales
in
this
task
he
was
assisted
by
owen
and
other
welsh
scholars
after
the
cessation
of
jones
exertions
the
old
apathy
returned
and
continued
till
within
a
few
years
owen
exerted
himself
to
obtain
support
for
the
publication
of
the
mabinogeon
or
prose
tales
of
the
welsh
but
died
without
accomplishing
his
purpose
which
has
since
been
carried
into
execution
by
lady
charlotte
guest
the
legends
which
fill
the
remainder
of
this
volume
are
taken
from
this
work
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
more
fully
in
the
introductory
chapter
to
the
first
part
the
welsh
bards
the
authors
to
whom
the
oldest
welsh
poems
are
attributed
are
aneurin
who
is
supposed
to
have
lived
to
and
taliesin
llywarch
hen
llywarch
the
aged
and
myrddin
or
merlin
who
were
a
few
years
later
the
authenticity
of
the
poems
which
bear
their
names
has
been
assailed
and
it
is
still
an
open
question
how
many
and
which
of
them
are
authentic
though
it
is
hardly
to
be
doubted
that
some
are
so
the
poem
of
aneurin
entitled
the
gododin
bears
very
strong
marks
of
authenticity
aneurin
was
one
of
the
northern
britons
of
who
have
left
to
that
part
of
the
district
they
inhabited
the
name
of
cumberland
or
land
of
the
cymri
in
this
poem
he
laments
the
defeat
of
his
countrymen
by
the
saxons
at
the
battle
of
cattraeth
in
consequence
of
having
partaken
too
freely
of
the
mead
before
joining
in
combat
the
bard
himself
and
two
of
his
were
all
who
escaped
from
the
field
a
portion
of
this
poem
has
been
translated
by
gray

the
following
is
an
extract
to

the
works
of

are
of
much
more
questionable
authenticity
there
is
a
story
of
the
adventures
of
taliesin
so
strongly
marked
with
mythical
traits
as
to
cast
suspicion
on
the
writings
attributed
to
him
this
story
will
be
found
in
the
subsequent
pages
the
triads
the
triads
are
a
peculiar
species
of
poetical
composition
of
which
the
welsh
bards
have
left
numerous
examples
they
are
enumerations
of
a
triad
of
persons
or
events
or
observations
strung
together
in
one
short
sentence
this
form
of
composition
originally
invented
in
all
likelihood
to
assist
the
memory
has
been
raised
by
the
welsh
to
a
degree
of
elegance
of
which
it
hardly
at
first
sight
appears
susceptible
the
triads
are
of
all
ages
some
of
them
probably
as
old
as
anything
in
the
language
short
as
they
are
individually

more

adventure
king
arthur
was
at
caerleon
upon
usk
and
one
day
he
sat
in
his
chamber
and
with
him
were
owain
the
son
of
urien
and
kynon
the
son
of
clydno
and
kay
the
son

at

by
the
window
in
the
centre
of
the
chamher
king
arthur
sat
upon
a
seat
of
green
rushes
footnote
the
use
of
green
rushes
in
apartments
was
by
no
means
peculiar
to
the
court
of
carleon
upon
usk
our
ancestors
had
a
great
predilection
for
them
and
they
seem
to
have
constituted
an
essential
article
not
only
of
comfort
but
of
luxury
the
custom
of
strewing
the
floor
with
rushes
is
well
known
to
have
existed
in
england
during
the
middle
ages
and
also
in
france
over
which
was
spread
a
covering
of
satin
and
a
cushion
of
red
satin
was
under
his
elbow
then
arthur
spoke
if
i
thought
you
would
not
disparage
me
said
he
i
would
sleep
while
i
wait
for
my
repast
and
you
can
entertain
one
another
with
relating
tales
and
can
obtain
a
flagon
of
mead
and
some
meat
from
kay
and
the
king
went
to
sleep
and
kynon
the
son
of
clydno
asked
kay
for
that
which
arthur
had
promised
them
i
too
will
have
the
good
tale
which
he
promised
me
said
kay
nay
answered
kynon
fairer
will
it
be
for
thee
to
fulfil
arthur
behest
in
the
first
place
and
then
we
will
tell
thee
the
best
tale
that
we
know
so
kay
went
to
the
kitchen
and
to
the
and
returned
bearing
a
flagon
of
mead
and
a
golden
goblet
and
a
handful
of
skewers
upon
which
were
broiled
collops
of
meat
then
they
ate
the
collops
and
began
to
drink
the
mead
now
said
kay
it
is
time
for
you
to
give
me
my
story
kynon
said
owain
do
thou
pay
to
kay
the
tale
that
is
his
due
i
will
do
so
answered
kynon
i
was
the
only
son
of
my
mother
and
father
and
i
was
exceedingly
aspiring
and
my
daring
was
very
great
i
thought
there
was
no
enterprise
in
the
world
too
mighty
for
me
and
after
i
had
achieved
all
the
adventures
that
were
in
my
own
country
i
equipped
myself
and
set
forth
to
journey
through
deserts
and
distant
regions
and
at
length
it
chanced
that
i
came
to
the
fairest
valley
in
the
world
wherein
were
trees
all
of
equal
growth
and
a
river
ran
through
the
valley
and
a
path
was
by
the
side
of
the
river
and
i
followed
the
path
until
midday
and
continued
my
journey
along
the
remainder
of
the
valley
until
the
evening
and
at
the
extremity
of
the
plain
i
came
to
a
large
and
lustrous
castle
at
the
foot
of
which
was
a
torrent
and
i
approached
the
castle
and
there
i
beheld
two
youths
with
yellow
curling
hair
each
with
a
frontlet
of
gold
upon
his
head
and
clad
in
a
garment
of
yellow
satin
and
they
had
gold
clasps
upon
their
insteps
in
the
hand
of
each
of
them
was
an
ivory
bow
strung
with
the
sinews
of
the
stag
and
their
arrows
and
their
shafts
were
of
the
bone
of
the
whale
and
were
winged
with
peacock
feathers
the
shafts
also
had
golden
heads
and
they
had
daggers
with
blades
of
gold
and
with
hilts
of
the
bone
of
the
whale
and
they
were
shooting
at
a
mark
and
a
little
away
from
them
i
saw
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
with
his
beard
newly
shorn
clad
in
a
robe
and
mantle
of
yellow
satin
and
round
the
top
of
his
mantle
was
a
band
of
gold
lace
on
his
feet
were
shoes
of
variegated
leather
footnote
cordwal
is
the
word
in
the
original
and
from
the
manner
in
which
it
is
used
it
is
evidently
intended
for
the
french
cordouan
or
cordovan
leather
which
derived
its
name
from
cordova
where
it
was
manufactured
from
this
comes
also
our
english
word
cordwainer
fastened
by
two
bosses
of
gold
when
i
saw
him
i
went
towards
him
and
saluted
him
and
such
was
his
courtesy
that
he
no
sooner
received
my
greeting
than
he
returned
it
and
he
went
with
me
towards
the
castle
now
there
were
no
dwellers
in
the
castle
except
those
who
were
in
one
hall
and
there
i
saw
four
and
twenty
damsels
embroidering
satin
at
a
window
and
this
i
tell
thee
kay
that
the
least
fair
of
them
was
fairer
than
the
fairest
maid
thou
didst
ever
behold
in
the
island
of
britain
and
the
least
lovely
of
them
was
more
lovely
than
guenever
the
wife
of
arthur
when
she
appeared
loveliest
at
the
feast
of
easter
they
rose
up
at
my
coming
and
six
of
them
took
my
horse
and
divested
me
of
my
armor
and
six
others
took
my
arms
and
washed
them
in
a
vessel
till
they
were
perfectly
bright
and
the
third
six
spread
cloths
upon
the
tables
and
prepared
meat
and
the
fourth
six
took
off
my
soiled
garments
and
placed
others
upon
me
namely
an
under
vest
and
a
doublet
of
fine
linen
and
a
robe
and
a
surcoat
and
a
mantle
of
yellow
satin
with
a
broad
gold
band
upon
the
mantle
and
they
placed
cushions
both
beneath
and
around
me
with
coverings
of
red
linen
and
i
sat
down
now
the
six
maidens
who
had
taken
my
horse
unharnessed
him
as
well
as
if
they
had
been
the
best
squires
in
the
island
of
britain
then
behold
they
brought
bowls
of
silver
wherein
was
water
to
wash
and
towels
of
linen
some
green
and
some
white
and
i
washed
and
in
a
little
while
the
man
sat
down
at
the
table
and
i
sat
next
to
him
and
below
me
sat
all
the
maidens
except
those
who
waited
on
us
and
the
table
was
of
silver
and
the
cloths
upon
the
table
were
of
linen
and
no
vessel
was
served
upon
the
table
that
was
not
either
of
gold
or
of
silver
or
of
buffalo
horn
and
our
meat
was
brought
to
us
and
verily
kay
i
saw
there
every
sort
of
meat
and
every
sort
of
liquor
that
i
ever
saw
elsewhere
but
the
meat
and
the
liquor
were
better
served
there
than
i
ever
saw
them
in
any
other
place
until
the
repast
was
half
over
neither
the
man
nor
any
one
of
the
damsels
spoke
a
single
word
to
me
but
when
the
man
perceived
that
it
would
be
more
agreeable
for
me
to
converse
than
to
eat
any
more
he
began
to
inquire
of
me
who
i
was
then
i
told
the
man
who
i
was
and
what
was
the
cause
of
my
journey
and
said
that
i
was
seeking
whether
any
one
was
superior
to
me
or
whether
i
could
gain
mastery
over
all
the
man
looked
upon
me
and
he
smiled
and
said
i
did
not
fear
to
do
thee
a
mischief
i
would
show
thee
that
which
thou
seekest
then
i
desired
him
to
speak
freely
and
he
said
here
and
in
the
morning
arise
early
and
take
the
road
upwards
through
the
valley
until
thou
readiest
the
wood
a
little
way
within
the
wood
thou
wilt
come
to
a
large
sheltered
glade
with
a
mound
in
the
centre
and
thou
wilt
see
a
black
man
of
great
stature
on
the
top
of
the
mound
he
has
but
one
foot
and
one
eye
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
he
is
the
ward
of
that
wood
and
thou
wilt
see
a
thousand
wild
animals
grazing
around
him
inquire
of
him
the
way
out
of
the
glade
and
he
will
reply
to
thee
briefly
and
will
point
out
the
road
by
which
thou
shalt
find
that
which
thou
art
in
quest
of
and
long
seemed
that
night
to
me
and
the
next
morning
i
arose
and
equipped
myself
and
mounted
my
horse
and
proceeded
straight
through
the
valley
to
the
wood
and
at
length
i
arrived
at
the
glade
and
the
black
man
was
there
sitting
upon
the
top
of
the
mound
and
i
was
three
times
more
astonished
at
the
number
of
wild
animals
that
i
beheld
than
the
man
had
said
i
should
be
then
i
inquired
of
him
the
way
and
he
asked
me
roughly
whither
i
would
go
and
when
i
had
told
him
who
i
was
and
what
i
sought
said
he
path
that
leads
toward
the
head
of
the
glade
and
there
thou
wilt
find
an
open
space
like
to
a
large
valley
and
in
the
midst
of
it
a
tall
tree
under
this
tree
is
a
fountain
and
by
the
side
of
the
fountain
a
marble
slab
and
on
the
marble
slab
a
silver
bowl
attached
by
a
chain
of
silver
that
it
may
not
be
carried
away
take
the
bowl
and
throw
a
bowlful
of
water
on
the
slab
and
if
thou
dost
not
find
trouble
in
that
adventure
thou
needest
not
seek
it
during
the
rest
of
thy
life
so
i
journeyed
on
until
i
reached
the
summit
of
the
steep
and
there
i
found
everything
as
the
black
man
had
described
it
to
me
and
i
went
up
to
the
tree
and
beneath
it
i
saw
the
fountain
and
by
its
side
the
marble
slab
and
the
silver
bowl
fastened
by
the
chain
then
i
took
the
bowl
and
cast
a
bowlful
of
water
upon
the
slab
and
immediately
i
heard
a
mighty
peal
of
thunder
so
that
heaven
and
earth
seemed
to
tremble
with
its
fury
and
after
the
thunder
came
a
shower
and
of
a
truth
i
tell
thee
kay
that
it
was
such
a
shower
as
neither
man
nor
beast
could
endure
and
live
i
turned
my
horse
flank
toward
the
shower
and
placed
the
beak
of
my
shield
over
his
head
and
neck
while
i
held
the
upper
part
of
it
over
my
own
neck
and
thus
i
withstood
the
shower
and
presently
the
sky
became
clear
and
with
that
behold
the
birds
lighted
upon
the
tree
and
sang
and
truly
kay
i
never
heard
any
melody
equal
to
that
either
before
or
since
and
when
i
was
most
charmed
with
listening
to
the
birds
lo
a
chiding
voice
was
heard
of
one
approaching
me
and
saying
knight
what
has
brought
thee
hither
what
evil
have
i
done
to
thee
that
thou
shouldst
act
towards
me
and
my
possessions
as
thou
hast
this
day
dost
thou
not
know
that
the
shower
has
left
in
my
dominions
neither
man
nor
beast
alive
that
was
exposed
to
it
and
thereupon
behold
a
knight
on
a
black
horse
appeared
clothed
in
velvet
and
with
a
tabard
of
black
linen
about
him
and
we
charged
each
other
and
as
the
onset
was
furious
it
was
not
long
before
i
was
overthrown
then
the
knight
passed
the
shaft
of
his
lance
through
the
of
my
horse
and
rode
off
with
the
two
horses
leaving
me
where
i
was
and
he
did
not
even
bestow
so
much
notice
upon
me
as
to
imprison
me
nor
did
he
despoil
me
of
my
arms
so
i
returned
along
the
road
by
which
i
had
come
and
when
i
reached
the
glade
where
the
black
man
was
i
confess
to
thee
kay
it
is
a
marvel
that
i
did
not
melt
down
into
a
liquid
pool
through
the
shame
that
i
felt
at
the
black
man
derision
and
that
night
i
came
to
the
same
castle
where
i
had
spent
the
night
preceding
and
i
was
more
agreeably
entertained
that
night
than
i
had
been
the
night
before
and
i
conversed
freely
with
the
inmates
of
the
castle
and
none
of
them
alluded
to
my
expedition
to
the
fountain
neither
did
i
mention
it
to
any
and
i
remained
there
that
night
when
i
arose
on
the
morrow
i
found
ready
saddled
a
dark
bay
palfrey
with
nostrils
as
red
as
scarlet
and
after
putting
on
my
armor
and
leaving
there
my
blessing
i
returned
to
my
own
court
and
that
horse
i
still
possess
and
he
is
in
the
stable
yonder
and
i
declare
that
i
would
not
part
with
him
for
the
best
palfrey
in
the
island
of
britain
now
of
a
truth
kay
no
man
ever
before
confessed
to
an
adventure
so
much
to
his
own
discredit
and
verily
it
seems
strange
to
me
that
neither
before
nor
since
have
i
heard
of
any
person
who
knew
of
this
adventure
and
that
the
subject
of
it
should
exist
within
king
arthur
dominions
without
any
other
person
lighting
upon
it

adventure
footnote
amongst
all
the
characters
of
early
british
history
none
is
the
more
interesting
or
occupies
more
conspicuous
place
than
the
hero
of
this
tale
urien
his
father
was
prince
of
rheged
a
district
comprising
the
present
cumberland
and
part
of
the
adjacent
country
his
valor
and
the
consideration
in
which
he
was
held
are
a
frequent
theme
of
bardic
song
and
form
the
subject
of
several
very
spirited
odes
by
taliesin
among
the
triads
there
is
one
relating
to
him
it
is
thus
translated
three
knights
of
battle
were
in
court
of
arthur
cadwr
the
earl
of
cornwall
launcelot
du
lac
and
owain
the
son
of
urien
and
this
was
their
characteristic
that
they
would
not
retreat
from
battle
neither
for
spear
nor
for
arrow
nor
for
sword
and
arthur
never
had
shame
in
battle
the
day
he
saw
their
faces
there
and
they
were
called
the
knights
of
battle
now
quoth
owain
would
it
not
be
well
to
go
and
endeavor
to
discover
that
place
by
the
hand
of
my
friend
said
kay
often
dost
thou
utter
that
with
thy
tongue
which
thou
wouldest
not
make
good
with
thy
deeds
in
very
truth
said
guenever
it
were
better
thou
wert
hanged
kay
than
to
use
such
uncourteous
speech
towards
a
man
like
owain
by
the
hand
of
my
friend
good
lady
said
kay
thy
praise
of
owain
is
not
greater
than
mine
with
that
arthur
awoke
and
asked
if
he
had
not
been
sleeping
a
little
yes
lord
answered
owain
thou
hast
slept
awhile
is
it
time
for
us
to
go
to
meat
it
is
lord
said
owain
then
the
horn
for
washing
was
sounded
and
the
king
and
all
his
household
sat
down
to
eat
and
when
the
meal
was
ended
owain
withdrew
to
his
lodging
and
made
ready
his
horse
and
his
arms
on
the
morrow
with
the
dawn
of
day
he
put
on
his
armor
and
mounted
his
charger
and
travelled
through
distant
lands
and
over
desert
mountains
and
at
length
he
arrived
at
the
valley
which
kynon
had
described
to
him
and
he
was
certain
that
it
was
the
same
that
he
sought
and
journeying
along
the
valley
by
the
side
of
the
river
he
followed
its
course
till
he
came
to
the
plain
and
within
sight
of
the
castle
when
he
approached
the
castle
he
saw
the
youths
shooting
with
their
bows
in
the
place
where
kynon
had
seen
them
and
the
yellow
man
to
whom
the
castle
belonged
standing
hard
by
and
no
sooner
had
owain
saluted
the
yellow
man
than
he
was
saluted
by
him
in
return
and
he
went
forward
towards
the
castle
and
there
he
saw
the
chamber
and
when
he
had
entered
the
chamber
he
beheld
the
maidens
working
at
satin
embroidery
in
chains
of
gold
and
their
beauty
and
their
comeliness
seemed
to
owain
far
greater
than
kynon
had
represented
to
him
and
they
arose
to
wait
upon
owain
as
they
had
done
to
kynon
and
the
meal
which
they
set
before
him
gave
even
more
satisfaction
to
owain
than
it
had
done
to
kynon
about
the
middle
of
the
repast
the
yellow
man
asked
owain
the
object
of
his
journey
and
owain
made
it
known
to
him
and
said
i
am
in
quest
of
the
knight
who
guards
the
fountain
upon
this
the
yellow
man
smiled
and
said
that
he
was
as
loth
to
point
out
that
adventure
to
him
as
he
had
been
to
kynon
however
he
described
the
whole
to
owain
and
they
retired
to
rest
the
next
morning
owain
found
his
horse
made
ready
for
him
by
the
damsels
and
he
set
forward
and
came
to
the
glade
where
the
black
man
was
and
the
stature
of
the
black
man
seemed
more
wonderful
to
owain
than
it
had
done
to
kynon
and
owain
asked
of
him
his
road
and
he
showed
it
to
him
and
owain
followed
the
road
till
he
came
to
the
green
tree
and
he
beheld
the
fountain
and
the
slab
beside
the
fountain
with
the
bowl
upon
it
and
owain
took
the
bowl
and
threw
a
bowlful
of
water
upon
the
slab
and
lo
the
thunder
was
heard
and
after
the
thunder
came
the
shower
more
violent
than
kynon
had
described
and
after
the
shower
the
sky
became
bright
and
immediately
the
birds
came
and
settled
upon
the
tree
and
sang
and
when
their
song
was
most
pleasing
to
owain
he
beheld
a
knight
coming
towards
him
through
the
valley
and
he
prepared
to
receive
him
and
encountered
him
violently
having
broken
both
their
lances
they
drew
their
swords
and
fought
blade
to
blade
then
owain
struck
the
knight
a
blow
through
his
helmet
and
visor
and
through
the
skin
and
the
flesh
and
the
bone
until
it
wounded
the
very
brain
then
the
black
knight
felt
that
he
had
received
a
mortal
wound
upon
which
he
turned
his
horse
head
and
fled
and
owain
pursued
him
and
followed
close
upon
him
although
he
was
not
near
enough
to
strike
him
with
his
sword
then
owain
descried
a
vast
and
resplendent
castle
and
they
came
to
the
castle
gate
and
the
black
knight
was
allowed
to
enter
and
the
portcullis
was
let
fall
upon
owain
and
it
struck
his
horse
behind
the
saddle
and
cut
him
in
two
and
carried
away
the
rowels
of
the
spurs
that
were
upon
owains
heels
and
the
portcullis
descended
to
the
floor
and
the
rowels
of
the
spurs
and
part
of
the
horse
were
without
and
owain
with
the
other
part
of
the
horse
remained
between
the
two
gates
and
the
inner
gate
was
closed
so
that
owain
could
not
go
thence
and
owain
was
in
a
perplexing
situation
and
while
he
was
in
this
state
he
could
see
through
an
aperture
in
the
gate
a
street
facing
him
with
a
row
of
houses
on
each
side
and
he
beheld
a
maiden
with
yellow
curling
hair
and
a
frontlet
of
gold
upon
her
head
and
she
was
clad
in
a
dress
of
yellow
satin
and
on
her
feet
were
shoes
of
variegated
leather
and
she
approached
the
gate
and
desired
that
it
should
be
opened
heaven
knows
lady
said
owain
it
is
no
more
possible
for
me
to
open
to
thee
from
hence
than
it
is
for
thee
to
set
me
free
and
he
told
her
his
name
and
who
he
was
truly
said
the
damsel
it
is
very
sad
that
thou
canst
not
be
released
and
every
woman
ought
to
succor
thee
for
i
know
there
is
no
one
more
faithful
in
the
service
of
ladies
than
thou
therefore
quoth
she
whatever
is
in
my
power
to
do
for
thy
release
i
will
do
it
take
this
ring
and
put
it
on
thy
finger
with
the
stone
inside
thy
hand
and
close
thy
hand
upon
the
stone
and
as
long
as
thou
concealest
it
it
will
conceal
thee
when
they
come
forth
to
fetch
thee
they
will
be
much
grieved
that
they
can
not
find
thee
and
i
will
await
thee
on
the
horseblock
yonder
and
thou
wilt
be
able
to
see
me
though
i
can
not
see
thee
therefore
come
and
place
thy
hand
upon
my
shoulder
that
i
may
know
that
thou
art
near
me
and
by
the
way
that
i
go
hence
do
thou
accompany
me
then
the
maiden
went
away
from
owain
and
he
did
all
that
she
had
told
him
and
the
people
of
the
castle
came
to
seek
owain
to
put
him
to
death
and
when
they
found
nothing
but
the
half
of
his
horse
they
were
sorely
grieved
and
owain
vanished
from
among
them
and
went
to
the
maiden
and
placed
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
whereupon
she
set
off
and
owain
followed
her
until
they
came
to
the
door
of
a
large
and
beautiful
chamber
and
the
maiden
opened
it
and
they
went
in
and
owain
looked
around
the
chamber
and
behold
there
was
not
a
single
nail
in
it
that
was
not
painted
with
gorgeous
colors
and
there
was
not
a
single
panel
that
had
not
sundry
images
in
gold
portrayed
upon
it
the
maiden
kindled
a
fire
and
took
water
in
a
silver
bowl
and
gave
owain
water
to
then
she
placed
before
him
a
silver
table
inlaid
with
gold
upon
which
was
a
cloth
of
yellow
linen
and
she
brought
him
food
and
of
a
truth
owain
never
saw
any
kind
of
meat
that
was
not
there
in
abundance
but
it
was
better
cooked
there
than
he
had
ever
found
it
in
any
other
place
and
there
was
not
one
vessel
from
which
he
was
served
that
was
not
of
gold
or
of
silver
and
owain
eat
and
drank
until
late
in
the
afternoon
when
lo
they
heard
a
mighty
clamor
in
the
castle
and
owain
asked
the
maiden
what
it
was
they
are
administering
extreme
unction
said
she
to
the
nobleman
who
owns
the
castle
and
she
prepared
a
couch
for
owain
which
was
meet
for
arthur
himself
and
owain
went
to
sleep
and
a
little
after
daybreak
he
heard
an
exceeding
loud
clamor
and
wailing
and
he
asked
the
maiden
what
was
the
cause
of
it
they
are
bearing
to
the
church
the
body
of
the
nobleman
who
owned
the
castle
and
owain
rose
up
and
clothed
himself
and
opened
a
window
of
the
chamber
and
looked
towards
the
castle
and
he
could
see
neither
the
bounds
nor
the
extent
of
the
hosts
that
filled
the
streets
and
they
were
fully
armed
and
a
vast
number
of
women
were
with
them
both
on
horseback
and
on
foot
and
all
the
ecclesiastics
in
the
city
singing
in
the
midst
of
the
throng
he
beheld
the
bier
over
which
was
a
veil
of
white
linen
and
wax
tapers
were
burning
beside
and
around
it
and
none
that
supported
the
bier
was
lower
in
rank
than
a
powerful
baron
never
did
owain
see
an
assemblage
so
gorgeous
with
silk
footnote
before
the
sixth
century
all
the
silk
used
by
europeans
had
been
brought
to
them
by
the
seres
the
ancestors
of
the
present
boukharians
whence
it
derived
its
latin
name
of
serica
in
the
silkworm
was
brought
by
two
monks
to
constantinople
but
the
manufacture
of
silk
was
confined
to
the
greek
empire
till
the
year
when
roger
king
of
sicily
returning
from
a
crusade
collected
some
manufacturers
from
athens
and
corinth
and
established
them
at
palermo
whence
the
trade
was
gradually
disseminated
over
italy
the
varieties
of
silk
stuffs
known
at
this
time
were
velvet
satin
which
was
called
samite
and
taffety
called
cendal
or
sendall
all
of
which
were
occasionally
stitched
with
gold
and
silver
and
satin
and
following
the
train
he
beheld
a
lady
with
yellow
hair
falling
over
her
shoulders
and
stained
with
blood
and
about
her
a
dress
of
yellow
satin
which
was
torn
upon
her
feet
were
shoes
of
variegated
leather
and
it
was
a
marvel
that
the
ends
of
her
fingers
were
not
bruised
from
the
violence
with
which
she
smote
her
hands
together
truly
she
would
have
been
the
fairest
lady
owain
ever
saw
had
she
been
in
her
usual
guise
and
her
cry
was
louder
than
the
shout
of
the
men
or
the
clamor
of
the
trumpets
no
sooner
had
he
beheld
the
lady
than
he
became
inflamed
with
her
love
so
that
it
took
entire
possession
of
him
then
he
inquired
of
the
maiden
who
the
lady
was
heaven
knows
replied
the
maiden
she
is
the
fairest
and
the
most
chaste
and
the
most
liberal
and
the
most
noble
of
women
she
is
my
mistress
and
she
is
called
the
countess
of
the
fountain
the
wife
of
him
whom
thou
didst
slay
yesterday
verily
said
owain
she
is
the
woman
that
i
love
best
verily
said
the
maiden
she
shall
also
love
thee
not
a
little
then
the
maiden
prepared
a
repast
for
owain
and
truly
he
thought
he
had
never
before
so
good
a
meal
nor
was
he
ever
so
well
served
then
she
left
him
and
went
towards
the
castle
when
she
came
there
she
found
nothing
but
mourning
and
sorrow
and
the
countess
in
her
chamber
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
any
one
through
grief
luned
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
maiden
saluted
her
but
the
countess
answered
her
not
and
the
maiden
bent
down
towards
her
and
said
what
aileth
thee
that
thou
answereth
no
one
luned
said
the
countess
what
change
hath
befallen
thee
that
thou
hast
not
come
to
visit
me
in
my
grief
it
was
wrong
in
thee
and
i
so
sorely
afflicted
truly
said
luned
i
thought
thy
good
sense
was
greater
than
i
find
it
to
be
is
it
well
for
thee
to
mourn
after
that
good
man
or
for
anything
else
that
thou
canst
not
have
i
declare
to
heaven
said
the
countess
that
in
the
whole
world
there
is
not
a
man
equal
to
him
not
so
said
luned
for
an
ugly
man
would
be
as
good
as
or
better
than
he
i
declare
to
heaven
said
the
countess
that
were
it
not
repugnant
to
me
to
put
to
death
one
whom
i
have
brought
up
i
would
have
thee
executed
for
making
such
a
comparison
to
me
as
it
is
i
will
banish
thee
i
am
glad
said
luned
that
thou
hast
no
other
cause
to
do
so
than
that
i
would
have
been
of
service
to
thee
where
thou
didst
not
know
what
was
to
thine
advantage
henceforth
evil
betide
whichever
of
us
shall
make
the
first
advance
towards
reconciliation
to
the
other
whether
i
should
seek
an
invitation
from
thee
or
thou
of
thine
own
accord
should
send
to
invite
with
that
luned
went
forth
and
the
countess
arose
and
followed
her
to
the
door
of
the
chamber
and
began
coughing
loudly
and
when
luned
looked
back
the
countess
beckoned
to
her
and
she
returned
to
the
countess
in
truth
said
the
countess
evil
is
thy
disposition
but
if
thou
knowest
what
is
to
my
advantage
declare
it
to
me
i
will
do
so
said
she
thou
knowest
that
except
by
warfare
and
arms
it
is
impossible
for
thee
to
preserve
thy
possessions
delay
not
therefore
to
seek
some
one
who
can
defend
them
and
how
can
i
do
that
said
the
countess
i
will
tell
thee
said
luned
unless
thou
canst
defend
the
fountain
thou
canst
not
maintain
thy
dominions
and
no
one
can
defend
the
fountain
except
it
be
a
knight
of
household
i
will
go
to
arthur
court
and
ill
betide
me
if
i
return
not
thence
with
a
warrior
who
can
guard
the
fountain
as
well
as
or
even
better
than
he
who
defended
it
formerly
that
will
be
hard
to
perform
said
the
countess
go
however
and
make
proof
of
that
which
thou
hast
promised
luned
set
out
under
the
pretence
of
going
to
arthur
court
but
she
went
back
to
the
mansion
where
she
had
left
owain
and
she
tarried
there
as
long
as
it
might
have
taken
her
to
travel
to
the
court
of
king
arthur
and
back
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
apparelled
herself
and
went
to
visit
the
countess
and
the
countess
was
much
rejoiced
when
she
saw
her
and
inquired
what
news
she
brought
from
the
court
i
bring
thee
the
best
of
news
said
luned
for
i
have
compassed
the
object
of
my
mission
when
wilt
thou
that
i
should
present
to
thee
the
chieftain
who
has
come
with
me
hither
bring
him
here
to
visit
me
said
the
countess
and
i
will
cause
the
town
to
be
assembled
by
that
time
and
luned
returned
home
and
the
next
day
at
noon
owain
arrayed
himself
in
a
coat
and
a
surcoat
and
a
mantle
of
yellow
satin
upon
which
was
a
broad
band
of
gold
lace
and
on
his
feet
were
high
shoes
of
variegated
leather
which
were
fastened
by
golden
clasps
in
the
form
of
lions
and
they
proceeded
to
the
chamber
of
the
countess
right
glad
was
the
countess
of
their
coming
and
she
gazed
steadfastly
upon
owain
and
said
luned
this
knight
has
not
the
look
of
a
traveller
what
harm
is
there
in
that
lady
said
luned
i
am
certain
said
the
countess
that
no
other
man
than
this
chased
the
soul
from
the
body
of
my
lord
so
much
the
better
for
thee
lady
said
luned
for
had
he
not
been
stronger
than
thy
lord
he
could
not
have
deprived
him
of
life
there
is
no
remedy
for
that
which
is
past
be
it
as
it
may
go
back
to
thine
abode
said
the
countess
and
i
will
take
counsel
the
next
day
the
countess
caused
all
her
subjects
to
assemble
and
showed
them
that
her
earldom
was
left
defenceless
and
that
it
could
not
be
protected
but
with
horse
and
arms
and
military
skill
therefore
said
she
this
is
what
i
offer
for
your
choice
either
let
one
of
you
take
me
or
give
your
consent
for
me
to
take
a
husband
from
elsewhere
to
defend
my
dominions
so
they
came
to
the
determination
that
it
was
better
that
she
should
have
permission
to
marry
some
one
from
elsewhere
and
thereupon
she
sent
for
the
bishops
and
archbishops
to
celebrate
her
nuptials
with
owain
and
the
men
of
the
earldom
did
owain
homage
and
owain
defended
the
fountain
with
lance
and
sword
and
this
is
the
manner
in
which
he
defended
it
whensoever
a
knight
came
there
he
overthrew
him
and
sold
him
for
his
full
worth
and
what
he
thus
gained
he
divided
among
his
barons
and
his
knights
and
no
man
in
the
whole
world
could
be
more
beloved
than
he
was
by
his
subjects
and
it
was
thus
for
the
space
of
three
years
footnote
there
exists
an
ancient
poem
printed
among
those
of
taliesin
called
the
elegy

and
containing
several
very
beautiful
and
spirited
passages

chapter
iv
the
lady
of
the
fountain
continued
gawain
adventure
it
befell
that
as
gawain
went
forth
one
day
with
king
arthur
he
perceived
him
to
be
very
sad
and
sorrowful
and
gawain
was
much
grieved
to
see
arthur
in
his
state
and
he
questioned
him
saying
o
my
lord
what
has
befallen
thee
in
sooth
gawain
said
arthur
i
am
grieved
concerning
owain
whom
i
have
lost
these
three
years
and
i
shall
certainly
die
if
the
fourth
year
pass
without
my
seeing
him
now
i
am
sure
that
it
is
through
the
tale
which
kynon
the
son
of
clydno
related
that
i
have
lost
owain
there
is
no
need
for
thee
said
gawain
to
summon
to
arms
thy
whole
dominions
on
this
account
for
thou
thyself
and
the
men
of
thy
household
will
be
able
to
avenge
owain
if
he
be
slain
or
to
set
him
free
if
he
be
in
prison
and
if
alive
to
bring
him
back
with
thee
and
it
was
settled
according
to
what
gawain
had
said
then
arthur
and
the
men
of
his
household
prepared
to
go
and
seek
owain
and
kynon
the
son
of
clydno
acted
as
their
guide
and
arthur
came
to
the
castle
where
kynon
had
been
before
and
when
he
came
there
the
youths
were
shooting
in
the
same
place
and
the
yellow
man
was
standing
hard
by
when
the
yellow
man
saw
arthur
he
greeted
him
and
invited
him
to
the
castle
and
arthur
accepted
his
invitation
and
they
entered
the
castle
together
and
great
as
was
the
number
of
his
retinue
their
presence
was
scarcely
observed
in
the
castle
so
vast
was
its
extent
and
the
maidens
rose
up
to
wait
on
them
and
the
service
of
the
maidens
appeared
to
them
all
to
excel
any
attendance
they
had
ever
met
with
and
even
the
pages
who
had
charge
of
the
horses
were
no
worse
served
that
night
than
arthur
himself
would
have
been
in
his
own
palace
the
next
morning
arthur
set
out
thence
with
kynon
for
his
guide
and
came
to
the
place
where
the
black
man
was
and
the
stature
of
the
black
man
was
more
surprising
to
arthur
than
it
had
been
represented
to
him
and
they
came
to
the
top
of
the
wooded
steep
and
traversed
the
valley
till
they
reached
the
green
tree
where
they
saw
the
fountain
and
the
bowl
and
the
slab
and
upon
that
kay
came
to
arthur
and
spoke
to
him
my
lord
said
he
i
know
the
meaning
of
all
this
and
my
request
is
that
thou
wilt
permit
me
to
throw
the
water
on
the
slab
and
to
receive
the
first
adventure
that
may
befall
and
arthur
gave
him
leave
then
kay
threw
a
bowlful
of
water
upon
the
slab
and
immediately
there
came
the
thunder
and
after
the
thunder
the
shower
and
such
a
they
had
never
known
before
after
the
shower
had
ceased
the
sky
became
clear
and
on
looking
at
the
tree
they
beheld
it
completely
leafless
then
the
birds
descended
upon
the
tree
and
the
song
of
the
birds
was
far
sweeter
than
any
strain
they
had
ever
heard
before
then
they
beheld
a
knight
on
a
black
horse
clothed
in
black
satin
coming
rapidly
towards
them
and
kay
met
him
and
encountered
him
and
it
was
not
long
before
kay
was
overthrown
and
the
knight
withdrew
and
arthur
and
his
host
encamped
for
the
night
and
when
they
arose
in
the
morning
they
perceived
the
signal
of
combat
upon
the
lance
of
the
knight
then
one
by
one
all
the
household
of
arthur
went
forth
to
combat
the
knight
until
there
was
not
one
that
was
not
overthrown
by
him
except
arthur
and
gawain
and
arthur
armed
himself
to
encounter
the
knight
o
my
lord
said
gawain
permit
me
to
fight
with
him
first
and
arthur
permitted
him
and
he
went
forth
to
meet
the
knight
having
over
himself
and
his
horse
a
satin
robe
of
honor
which
had
been
sent
him
by
the
daughter
of
the
earl
of
rhangyr
and
in
this
dress
he
was
not
known
by
any
of
the
host
and
they
charged
each
other
and
fought
all
that
day
until
the
evening
and
neither
of
them
was
able
to
unhorse
the
other
and
so
it
was
the
next
day
they
broke
their
lances
in
the
shock
but
neither
of
them
could
obtain
the
mastery
and
the
third
day
they
fought
with
exceeding
strong
lances
and
they
were
incensed
with
rage
and
fought
furiously
even
until
noon
and
they
gave
each
other
such
a
shock
that
the
girths
of
their
horses
were
broken
so
that
they
fell
over
their
cruppers
to
the
ground
and
they
rose
up
speedily
and
drew
their
swords
and
resumed
the
combat
and
all
they
that
witnessed
their
encounter
felt
assured
that
they
had
never
before
seen
two
men
so
valiant
or
so
powerful
and
had
it
been
midnight
it
would
have
been
light
from
the
fire
that
flashed
from
their
weapons
and
the
knight
gave
gawain
a
blow
that
turned
his
helmet
from
off
his
face
so
that
the
knight
saw
that
it
was
gawain
then
owain
said
my
lord
gawain
i
did
not
know
thee
for
my
cousin
owing
to
the
robe
of
honor
that
enveloped
thee
take
my
sword
and
my
arms
said
gawain
thou
owain
art
the
victor
take
thou
my
sword
and
with
that
arthur
saw
that
they
were
conversing
and
advanced
toward
them
my
lord
arthur
said
gawam
here
is
owain
who
has
vanquished
me
and
will
not
take
my
arms
my
lord
said
owain
it
is
he
that
has
vanquished
me
and
he
will
not
take
my
sword
give
me
your
swords
said
arthur
and
then
neither
of
you
has
vanquished
the
other
then
owain
put
his
arms
around
neck
and
they
embraced
and
all
the
host
hurried
forward
to
see
owain
and
to
embrace
him
and
there
was
nigh
being
a
loss
of
life
so
great
was
the
press
and
they
retired
that
night
and
the
next
day
arthur
prepared
to
depart
my
lord
said
owain
this
is
not
well
of
thee
for
i
have
been
absent
from
thee
these
three
years
and
during
all
that
time
up
to
this
very
day
i
have
been
preparing
a
banquet
for
thee
knowing
that
thou
wouldst
come
to
seek
me
tarry
with
me
therefore
until
thou
and
thy
attendants
have
recovered
the
fatigues
of
the
journey
and
have
been
anointed
and
they
all
proceeded
to
the
castle
of
the
countess
of
the
fountain
and
the
banquet
which
had
been
three
years
preparing
was
consumed
in
three
months
never
had
they
a
more
delicious
or
agreeable
banquet
and
arthur
prepared
to
depart
then
he
sent
an
embassy
to
the
countess
to
beseech
her
to
permit
owain
to
go
with
him
for
the
space
of
three
months
that
he
might
show
him
to
the
nobles
and
the
fair
dames
of
the
island
of
britain
and
the
countess
gave
her
consent
although
it
was
very
painful
to
her
so
owain
came
with
arthur
to
the
island
of
britain
and
when
he
was
once
more
amongst
his
kindred
and
friends
he
remained
three
years
instead
of
three
months
with
them
the
adventure
of
the
lion
and
as
owain
one
day
sat
at
meat
in
the
city
of
caerleon
upon
usk
behold
a
damsel
entered
the
hall
upon
a
bay
horse
with
a
curling
mane
and
covered
with
foam
and
the
bridle
and
as
much
as
was
seen
of
the
saddle
were
of
gold
and
the
damsel
was
arrayed
in
a
dress
of
yellow
satin
and
she
came
up
to
owain
and
took
the
ring
from
off
his
hand
thus
said
she
shall
be
treated
the
deceiver
the
traitor
the
faithless
the
disgraced
and
the
beardless
and
she
turned
her
horse
head
and
departed
footnote
the
custom
of
riding
into
a
hall
while
the
lord
and
his
guests
sat
at
meat
might
be
illustrated
by
numerous
passages
of
ancient
romance
and
history
but
a
quotation
from
beautiful
and
tale
of
cambuscan
is
sufficient
and
so
befell
that
after
the
thridde
cours
while
that
this
king
sat
thus
in
his
nobley

in

spoke
a

for

of
this
knight
him
to
behold
full
besily
they
waiten
young
and
old
then
his
adventure
came
to
owain
remembrance
and
he
was
sorrowful
and
having
finished
eating
he
went
to
his
own
abode
and
made
preparations
that
night
and
the
next
day
he
arose
but
did
not
go
to
the
court
nor
did
he
return
to
the
countess
of
the
fountain
but
wandered
to
the
distant
parts
of
the
earth
and
to
uncultivated
mountains
and
he
remained
there
until
all
his
apparel
was
worn
out
and
his
body
was
wasted
away
and
his
hair
was
grown
long
and
he
went
about
with
the
wild
beasts
and
fed
with
them
until
they
became
familiar
with
him
but
at
length
he
became
so
weak
that
he
could
no
longer
bear
them
company
then
he
descended
from
the
mountains
to
the
valley
and
came
to
a
park
that
was
the
fairest
in
the
world
and
belonged
to
a
charitable
lady
one
day
the
lady
and
her
attendants
went
forth
to
walk
by
a
lake
that
was
in
the
middle
of
the
park
and
they
saw
the
form
of
a
man
lying
as
if
dead
and
they
were
terrified
nevertheless
they
went
near
him
and
touched
him
and
they
saw
that
there
was
life
in
him
and
the
lady
returned
to
the
castle
and
took
a
flask
full
of
precious
ointment
and
gave
it
to
one
of
her
maidens
go
with
this
said
she
and
take
with
thee
yonder
horse
and
clothing
and
place
them
near
the
man
we
saw
just
now
and
anoint
him
with
this
balsam
near
his
heart
and
if
there
is
life
in
him
he
will
revive
through
the
efficiency
of
this
balsam
then
watch
what
he
will
do
and
the
maiden
departed
from
her
and
went
and
poured
of
the
balsam
upon
owain
and
left
the
horse
and
the
garments
hard
by
and
went
a
little
way
off
and
hid
herself
to
watch
him
in
a
short
time
she
saw
him
begin
to
move
and
he
rose
up
and
looked
at
his
person
and
became
ashamed
of
the
unseemliness
of
his
appearance
then
he
perceived
the
horse
and
the
garments
that
were
near
him
and
he
clothed
himself
and
with
difficulty
mounted
the
horse
then
the
damsel
discovered
herself
to
him
and
saluted
him
and
he
and
the
maiden
proceeded
to
the
castle
and
the
maiden
conducted
him
to
a
pleasant
chamber
and
kindled
a
fire
and
left
him
and
he
stayed
at
the
castle
three
months
till
he
was
restored
to
his
former
guise
and
became
even
more
comely
than
he
had
ever
been
before
and
owain
rendered
signal
service
to
the
lady
in
a
controversy
with
a
powerful
neighbor
so
that
he
made
ample
requital
to
her
for
her
hospitality
and
he
took
his
departure
and
as
he
journeyed
he
heard
a
loud
yelling
in
a
wood
and
it
was
repeated
a
second
and
a
third
time
and
owain
went
towards
the
spot
and
beheld
a
huge
craggy
mound
in
the
middle
of
the
wood
on
the
side
of
which
was
a
gray
rock
and
there
was
a
cleft
in
the
rock
and
a
serpent
was
within
the
cleft
and
near
the
rock
stood
a
black
lion
and
every
time
the
lion
sought
to
go
thence
the
serpent
darted
towards
him
to
attack
him
and
owain
unsheathed
his
sword
and
drew
near
to
the
rock
and
as
the
serpent
sprung
out
he
struck
him
with
his
sword
and
cut
him
in
two
and
he
dried
his
sword
and
went
on
his
way
as
before
but
behold
the
lion
followed
him
and
played
about
him
as
though
it
had
been
a
greyhound
that
he
had
reared
they
proceeded
thus
throughout
the
day
until
the
evening
and
when
it
was
time
for
owain
to
take
his
rest
he
dismounted
and
turned
his
horse
loose
in
a
flat
and
wooded
meadow
and
he
struck
fire
and
when
the
fire
was
kindled
the
lion
brought
him
fuel
enough
to
last
for
three
nights
and
the
lion
disappeared
and
presently
the
lion
returned
bearing
a
fine
large
roebuck
and
he
threw
it
down
before
owain
who
went
towards
the
fire
with
it
and
owain
took
the
roebuck
and
skinned
it
and
placed
collops
of
its
flesh
upon
skewers
round
the
fire
the
rest
of
the
buck
he
gave
to
the
lion
to
devour
while
he
was
so
employed
he
heard
a
deep
groan
near
him
and
a
second
and
a
third
and
the
place
whence
the
groans
proceeded
was
a
cave
in
the
rock
and
owain
went
near
and
called
out
to
know
who
it
was
that
groaned
so
piteously
and
a
voice
answered
i
am
luned
the
of
the
countess
of
the
fountain
and
what
dost
thou
here
said
he
i
am
imprisoned
said
she
on
account
of
the
knight
who
came
from
arthur
court
and
married
the
countess
and
he
staid
a
short
time
with
her
but
he
afterwards
departed
for
the
court
of
arthur
and
has
not
returned
since
and
two
of
the
countess
pages
traduced
him
and
called
him
a
deceiver
and
because
i
said
i
would
vouch
for
it
he
would
come
before
long
and
maintain
his
cause
against
both
of
them
they
imprisoned
me
in
this
cave
and
said
that
i
should
be
put
to
death
unless
he
came
to
deliver
me
by
a
certain
day
and
that
is
no
further
off
than
and
i
have
no
one
to
send
to
seek
him
for
me
his
name
is
owain
the
son
of
urien
and
art
thou
certain
that
if
that
knight
knew
all
this
he
would
come
to
thy
rescue
i
am
most
certain
of
it
said
she
when
the
collops
were
cooked
owain
divided
them
into
two
parts
between
himself
and
the
maiden
and
then
owain
laid
himself
down
to
sleep
and
never
did
sentinel
keep
stricter
watch
over
his
lord
than
the
lion
that
night
over
owain
and
the
next
day
there
came
the
two
pages
with
a
great
troop
of
attendants
to
take
luned
from
her
cell
and
put
her
to
death
and
owain
asked
them
what
charge
they
had
against
her
and
they
told
him
of
the
compact
that
was
between
them
as
the
maiden
had
done
the
night
before
and
said
they
owain
has
failed
her
therefore
we
are
taking
her
to
be
burnt
truly
said
owain
he
is
a
good
knight
and
if
he
knew
that
the
maiden
was
in
such
peril
i
marvel
that
he
came
not
to
her
rescue
but
if
you
will
accept
me
in
his
stead
i
will
do
battle
with
you
we
will
said
the
youth
and
they
attacked
owain
and
he
was
hard
beset
by
them
and
with
that
the
lion
came
to
owain
assistance
and
they
two
got
the
better
of
the
young
men
and
they
said
to
him
chieftain
it
was
not
agreed
that
we
should
fight
save
with
thyself
alone
and
it
is
harder
for
us
to
contend
with
yonder
animal
than
with
thee
and
owain
put
the
lion
in
the
place
where
luned
had
been
imprisoned
and
blocked
up
the
door
with
stones
and
he
went
to
fight
with
the
young
men
as
before
but
owain
had
not
his
usual
strength
and
the
two
youths
pressed
hard
upon
him
and
the
lion
roared
incessantly
at
seeing
owain
in
trouble
and
he
brust
through
the
wall
until
he
found
a
way
out
and
rushed
upon
the
young
men
and
instantly
slew
them
so
luned
was
saved
from
being
burned
then
owain
returned
with
luned
to
the
castle
of
the
lady
of
the
fountain
and
when
he
went
thence
he
took
the
countess
with
him
to
arthur
court
and
she
was
his
wife
as
long
as
she
lived
chapter
v
geraint
the
son
of
erbin
arthur
was
accustomed
to
hold
his
court
at
caerleon
upon
usk
and
there
he
held
it
seven
easters
and
five
christmases
and
once
upon
a
time
he
held
his
court
there
at
whitsuntide
for
caerleon
was
the
place
most
easy
of
access
in
his
dominions
both
by
sea
and
by
land
and
there
were
assembled
nine
crowned
kings
who
were
his
tributaries
and
likewise
earls
and
barons
for
they
were
his
invited
guests
at
all
the
high
festivals
unless
they
were
prevented
by
any
great
hinderatice
and
when
he
was
at
caerleon
holding
his
court
thirteen
churches
were
set
apart
for
mass
and
thus
they
were
appointed
one
church
for
arthur
and
his
kings
and
his
guests
and
the
second
for
guenever
and
her
ladies
and
the
third
for
the
steward
of
the
household
and
the
suitors
and
the
fourth
for
the
franks
and
the
other
officers
and
the
other
nine
churches
were
for
the
nine
masters
of
the
household
and
chiefly
for
gawain
for
he
from
the
eminence
of
his
warlike
fame
and
from
the
nobleness
of
his
birth
was
the
most
exalted
of
the
nine
and
there
was
no
other
arrangement
respecting
the
churches
than
that
which
we
have
here
mentioned
and
on
as
the
king
sat
at
the
banquet
lo
there
entered
a
tall
youth
clad
in
a
coat
and
surcoat
of
satin
and
a
sword
about
his
neck
and
low
shoes
of
leather
upon
his
feet
and
he
came
and
stood
before
arthur
hail
to
thee
lord
said
he
heaven
prosper
thee
he
answered
and
be
thou
welcome
dost
thou
bring
any
new
tidings
i
do
lord
he
said
i
am
one
of
thy
foresters
lord
in
the
forest
of
dean
and
my
name
is
madoc
son
of
turgadarn
in
the
forest
i
saw
a
stag
the
like
of
which
beheld
i
never
yet
what
is
there
about
him
asked
arthur
that
thou
never
yet
didst
see
his
like
he
is
of
pure
white
lord
and
he
does
not
herd
with
any
other
animal
through
stateliness
and
pride
so
royal
is
his
bearing
and
i
come
to
seek
thy
counsel
lord
and
to
know
thy
will
concerning
him
it
seems
best
to
me
said
arthur
to
go
and
hunt
him
at
break
of
day
and
to
cause
general
notice
thereof
to
be
given
in
all
quarters
of
the
court
for
arthur
on
the
whitsuntide
before
held
court
at
old
caerleon
upon
usk
there
on
a
day
he
sitting
high
in
hall
before
him
came
a
forester
of
dean
wet
from
the
woods
with
notice
of
a
hart
taller
than
all
his
fellows
first
seen
that
day
these
things
he
told
the
king
then
the
good
king
gave
order
to
let
blow
his
horns
for
hunting
on
the
morrow
morn
enid
and
arryfuerys
was
arthur
chief
huntsman
and
arelivri
his
chief
page
and
all
received
notice
and
thus
it
was
arranged
then
guenever
said
to
arthur
wilt
thou
permit
me
lord
to
go
to
see
and
hear
the
hunt
of
the
stag
of
which
the
young
man
spoke
i
will
gladly
said
arthur
and
gawain
said
to
arthur
lord
if
it
seem
well
to
thee
permit
that
into
whose
hunt
soever
the
stag
shall
come
that
one
be
he
a
knight
or
one
on
foot
may
cut
off
his
head
and
give
it
to
whom
he
pleases
whether
to
his
own
or
to
the
lady
of
his
friend
i
grant
it
gladly
said
arthur
and
let
the
steward
of
the
household
be
chastised
if
all
things
are
not
ready
for
the
chase
and
they
passed
the
night
with
songs
and
diversions
and
discourse
and
ample
entertainment
and
when
it
was
time
for
them
all
to
go
to
sleep
they
went
and
when
the
next
day
came
they
arose
and
arthur
called
the
attendants
who
guarded
his
couch
and
there
were
four
pages
whose
names
were
cadyrnerth
the
son
of
gandwy
and
ambreu
the
son
of
bedwor
and
amhar
the
son
of
arthur
and
goreu
the
son
of
custennin
and
these
men
came
to
arthur
and
saluted
him
and
arrayed
him
in
his
garments
and
arthur
wondered
that
guenever
did
not
awake
and
the
attendants
wished
to
awaken
her
disturb
her
not
said
arthur
for
she
had
rather
sleep
than
go
to
see
the
hunting
then
arthur
went
forth
and
he
heard
two
horns
sounding
one
from
near
the
lodging
of
the
chief
huntsman
and
the
other
from
near
that
of
the
chief
page
and
the
whole
assembly
of
the
multitudes
came
to
arthur
and
they
took
the
road
to
the
forest
and
after
arthur
had
gone
forth
from
the
palace
guenever
awoke
and
called
to
her
maidens
and
apparalled
herself
maidens
said
she
i
had
leave
last
night
to
go
and
see
the
hunt
go
one
of
you
to
the
stable
and
order
hither
a
horse
such
as
a
woman
may
ride
and
one
of
them
went
and
she
found
but
two
horses
in
the
stable
and
guenever
and
one
of
her
maidens
mounted
them
and
went
through
the
usk
and
followed
the
track
of
the
men
and
the
horses
and
as
they
rode
thus
they
heard
a
loud
and
rushing
sound
and
they
looked
behind
them
and
beheld
a
knight
upon
a
hunter
foal
of
mighty
size
and
the
rider
was
a
fairhaired
youth
and
of
princely
mien
and
a
sword
was
at
his
side
and
a
robe
and
a
surcoat
of
satin
were
upon
him
and
two
low
shoes
of
leather
upon
his
feet
and
around
him
was
a
scarf
of
blue
purple
at
each
corner
of
which
was
a
golden
apple
for
prince
geraint
late
also
wearing
neither
nor
weapon
save
a
brand
came
quickly
flashing
through
the
shallow
ford
enid
and
his
horse
stepped
stately
and
swift
and
proud
and
he
overtook
guenever
and
saluted
her
heaven
prosper
thee
geraint
said
she
and
why
didst
thou
not
go
with
thy
lord
to
hunt
because
i
knew
not
when
he
went
said
he
i
marvel
too
said
she
how
he
could
go
unknown
to
me
but
thou
o
young
man
art
the
most
agreeable
companion
i
could
have
in
the
whole
kingdom
and
it
may
be
i
shall
be
more
amused
with
the
hunting
than
they
for
we
shall
hear
the
horns
when
they
sound
and
we
shall
hear
the
dogs
when
they
are
let
loose
and
begin
to
cry
so
they
went
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
there
they
stood
from
this
place
said
she
we
shall
hear
when
the
dogs
are
let
loose
and
thereupon
they
heard
a
loud
noise
and
they
looked
towards
the
spot
whence
it
came
and
they
beheld
a
dwarf
riding
upon
a
horse
stately
and
foaming
and
prancing
and
strong
and
spirited
and
in
the
hand
of
the
dwarf
was
a
whip
and
near
the
dwarf
they
saw
a
lady
upon
a
beautiful
white
horse
of
steady
and
stately
pace
and
she
was
clothed
in
a
garment
of
gold
brocade
and
near
her
was
a
knight
upon
a
of
large
size
with
heavy
and
bright
armor
both
upon
himself
and
upon
his
horse
and
truly
they
never
before
saw
a
knight
or
a
horse
or
armor
of
such
remarkable
size
geraint
said
guenever
knowest
thou
the
name
of
that
tall
knight
yonder
i
know
him
not
said
he
and
the
strange
armor
that
he
wears
prevents
my
either
seeing
his
face
or
his
features
go
maiden
said
guenever
and
ask
the
dwarf
who
that
knight
is
then
the
maiden
went
up
to
the
dwarf
and
she
inquired
of
the
dwarf
who
the
knight
was
i
will
not
tell
thee
he
answered
since
thou
art
so
churlish
said
she
i
will
ask
him
himself
thou
shalt
not
ask
him
by
my
faith
said
he
wherefore
not
said
she
because
thou
art
not
of
honor
sufficient
to
befit
thee
to
speak
to
my
lord
then
the
maiden
turned
her
horse
head
towards
the
knight
upon
which
the
dwarf
struck
her
with
the
whip
that
was
in
his
hand
across
the
face
and
the
eyes
so
that
the
blood
flowed
forth
and
the
maiden
returned
to
guenever
complaining
of
the
hurt
she
had
received
very
rudely
has
the
dwarf
treated
thee
said
geraint
and
he
put
his
hand
upon
the
hilt
of
his
sword
but
he
took
counsel
with
himself
and
considered
that
it
would
be
no
vengeance
for
him
to
slay
the
dwarf
and
to
be
attacked
unarmed
by
the
armed
knight
so
he
refrained
lady
said
he
i
will
follow
him
with
thy
permission
and
at
last
he
will
come
to
some
inhabited
place
where
i
may
have
arms
either
as
a
loan
or
for
a
pledge
so
that
i
may
encounter
the
knight
go
said
she
and
do
not
attack
him
until
thou
hast
good
arms
and
i
shall
be
very
anxious
concerning
thee
until
i
hear
tidings
of
thee
if
i
am
alive
said
he
thou
shalt
hear
tidings
of
me
by
afternoon
and
with
that
he
departed
and
the
road
they
took
was
below
the
palace
of
caerleon
and
across
the
ford
of
the
usk
and
they
went
along
a
fair
and
even
and
lofty
ridge
of
ground
until
they
came
to
a
town
and
at
the
extremity
of
the
town
they
saw
a
fortress
and
a
castle
and
as
the
knight
passed
through
the
town
all
the
people
arose
and
saluted
him
and
bade
him
welcome
and
when
geraint
came
into
the
town
he
looked
at
every
house
to
see
if
he
knew
any
of
those
whom
he
saw
but
he
knew
none
and
none
knew
him
to
do
him
the
kindness
to
let
him
have
arms
either
as
a
loan
or
for
a
pledge
and
every
house
he
saw
was
full
of
men
and
arms
and
horses
and
they
were
polishing
shields
and
burnishing
swords
and
washing
armor
and
shoeing
horses
and
the
knight
and
the
lady
and
the
dwarf
rode
up
to
the
castle
that
was
in
the
town
and
every
one
was
glad
in
the
castle
and
from
the
battlements
and
the
gates
they
risked
their
necks
through
their
eagerness
to
greet
them
and
to
show
their
joy
geraint
stood
there
to
see
whether
the
knight
would
remain
in
the
castle
and
when
he
was
certain
that
he
would
do
so
he
looked
around
him
and
at
a
little
distance
from
the
town
he
saw
an
old
palace
in
ruins
wherein
was
a
hall
that
was
falling
to
decay
and
high
above
a
piece
of
worn
by
the
feet
that
now
were
silent
wound
bare
to
the
sun
enid
and
as
he
knew
not
any
one
in
the
town
he
went
towards
the
old
palace
and
when
he
came
near
to
the
palace
he
saw
a
man
standing
by
it
in
tattered
garments
and
geraint
gazed
steadfastly
upon
him
then
the
man
said
to
him
young
man
wherefore
art
thou
thoughtful
i
am
thoughtful
said
he
because
i
know
not
where
to
pass
the
night
wilt
thou
come
forward
this
way
chieftain
said
he
and
thou
shalt
have
of
the
best
that
can
be
procured
for
thee
so
geraint
went
forward
and
the
man
led
the
way
into
the
hall
and
in
the
hall
he
dismounted
and
he
left
there
his
horse
then
he
went
on
to
the
upper
chamber
with
the
man
and
in
the
chamber
he
beheld
an
old
woman
sitting
on
a
cushion
with
old
garments
upon
her
yet
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
must
have
been
comely
when
in
the
bloom
of
youth
and
beside
her
was
a
maiden
upon
whom
were
a
vest
and
a
veil
that
were
old
and
beginning
to
be
worn
out
and
truly
he
never
saw
a
maiden
more
full
of
comeliness
and
grace
and
beauty
than
she
and
the
headed
man
said
to
the
maiden
there
is
no
attendant
for
the
horse
of
this
youth
but
thyself
i
will
render
the
best
service
i
am
able
said
she
both
to
him
and
to
his
horse
and
the
maiden
disarrayed
the
youth
and
then
she
furnished
his
horse
with
straw
and
corn
and
then
she
returned
to
the
chamber
and
the
man
said
to
the
maiden
go
to
the
town
and
bring
hither
the
best
that
thou
canst
find
both
of
food
and
of
liquor
i
will
gladly
lord
said
she
and
to
the
town
went
the
maiden
and
they
conversed
together
while
the
maiden
was
at
the
town
and
behold
the
maiden
came
back
and
a
youth
with
her
bearing
on
his
back
a
costrel
full
of
good
purchased
mead
and
a
quarter
of
a
young
bullock
and
in
the
hands
of
the
maiden
was
a
quantity
of
white
bread
and
she
had
some
manchet
bread
in
her
veil
and
she
came
into
the
chamber
i
would
not
obtain
better
than
this
said
she
nor
with
better
should
i
have
been
trusted
it
is
good
enough
said
geraint
and
they
caused
the
meat
to
be
boiled
and
when
their
food
was
ready
they
sat
down
and
it
was
in
this
wise
geraint
sat
between
the
man
and
his
wife
and
the
maiden
served
them
and
they
ate
and
drank
and
when
they
had
finished
eating
geraint
talked
with
the
headed
man
and
he
asked
him
in
the
first
place
to
whom
belonged
the
palace
that
he
was
in
truly
said
he
it
was
i
that
built
it
and
to
me
also
belonged
the
city
and
the
castle
which
thou
sawest
alas
said
geraint
how
is
it
that
thou
hast
lost
them
now
i
lost
a
great
earldom
as
well
as
these
said
he
and
this
is
how
i
lost
them
i
had
a
nephew
the
son
of
my
brother
and
i
took
care
of
his
possessions
but
he
was
impatient
to
enter
upon
them
so
he
made
war
upon
me
and
wrested
from
me
not
only
his
own
but
also
my
estates
except
this
castle
good
sir
said
geraint
wilt
thou
tell
me
wherefore
came
the
knight
and
the
lady
and
the
dwarf
just
now
into
the
town
and
what
is
the
preparation
which
i
saw
and
the
putting
of
arms
in
order
i
will
do
so
said
he
the
preparations
are
for
the
game
that
is
to
be
held
by
the
young
earl
which
will
be
on
this
wise
in
the
midst
of
a
meadow
which
is
here
two
forks
will
be
set
up
and
upon
the
two
forks
a
silver
rod
and
upon
the
silver
rod
a
and
for
the
there
will
be
a
tournament
and
to
the
tournament
will
go
all
the
array
thou
didst
see
in
the
city
of
men
and
of
horses
and
of
arms
and
with
each
man
will
go
the
lady
he
loves
best
and
no
man
can
joust
for
the
except
the
lady
he
loves
best
be
with
him
and
the
knight
that
thou
sawest
has
gained
the
these
two
years
and
if
he
gains
it
the
third
year
he
will
be
called
the
knight
of
the
from
that
time
forth
sir
said
geraint
what
is
thy
counsel
to
me
concerning
this
knight
on
account
of
the
insult
which
the
maiden
of
guenever
received
from
the
dwarf
and
geraint
told
the
man
what
the
insult
was
that
the
maiden
had
received
it
is
not
easy
to
counsel
thee
inasmuch
as
thou
hast
neither
dame
nor
maiden
belonging
to
thee
for
whom
thou
canst
joust
yet
i
have
arms
here
which
thou
couldst
have
and
there
is
my
horse
also
if
he
seem
to
thee
better
than
thine
own
ah
sir
said
he
heaven
reward
thee
but
my
own
horse
to
which
i
am
accustomed
together
with
thine
arms
will
suffice
me
and
if
when
the
appointed
time
shall
come
thou
wilt
permit
me
sir
to
challenge
for
yonder
maiden
that
is
thy
daughter
i
will
engage
if
i
escape
from
the
tournament
to
love
the
maiden
as
long
as
i
live
gladly
will
i
permit
thee
said
the
man
and
since
thou
dost
thus
resolve
it
is
necessary
that
thy
horse
and
arms
should
be
ready
at
break
of
day
for
then
the
knight
of
the
will
make
proclamation
and
ask
the
lady
he
loves
best
to
take
the
and
if
any
deny
it
to
her
by
force
will
he
defend
her
claim
and
therefore
said
the
man
it
is
needful
for
thee
to
be
there
at
daybreak
and
we
three
will
be
with
thee
and
thus
was
it
settled
and
at
night
they
went
to
sleep
and
before
the
dawn
they
arose
and
arrayed
themselves
and
by
the
time
that
it
was
day
they
were
all
four
in
the
meadow
and
there
was
the
knight
of
the
hawk
making
the
proclamation
and
asking
his
to
take
the
take
it
not
said
geraint
for
here
is
a
maiden
who
is
fairer
and
more
noble
and
more
comely
and
who
has
a
better
claim
to
it
than
thou
then
said
the
knight
if
thou
maintainest
the
to
be
due
to
her
come
forward
and
do
battle
with
me
and
geraint
went
forward
to
the
top
of
the
meadow
having
upon
himself
and
upon
his
horse
armor
which
was
heavy
and
rusty
and
of
uncouth
shape
then
they
encountered
each
other
and
they
broke
a
set
of
lances
and
they
broke
a
second
set
and
a
third
and
when
the
earl
and
his
company
saw
the
knight
of
the
gaining
the
mastery
there
was
shouting
and
joy
and
mirth
amongst
them
and
the
man
and
his
wife
and
his
daughter
were
sorrowful
and
the
man
served
geraint
with
lances
as
often
as
he
broke
them
and
the
dwarf
served
the
knight
of
the
then
the
man
said
to
geraint
o
chieftain
since
no
other
will
hold
with
thee
behold
here
is
the
lance
which
was
in
my
hand
on
the
day
when
i
received
the
honor
of
knighthood
and
from
that
time
to
this
i
never
broke
it
and
it
has
an
excellent
point
then
geraint
took
the
lance
thanking
the
man
and
thereupon
the
dwarf
also
brought
a
lance
to
his
lord
behold
here
is
a
lance
for
thee
not
less
good
than
his
said
the
dwarf
and
bethink
thee
that
no
knight
ever
withstood
thee
so
long
as
this
one
has
done
i
declare
to
heaven
said
geraint
that
unless
death
takes
me
quickly
hence
he
shall
fare
never
the
better
for
thy
service
and
geraint
pricked
his
horse
towards
him
from
afar
and
warning
him
he
rushed
upon
him
and
gave
him
a
blow
so
severe
and
furious
and
fierce
upon
the
face
of
his
shield
that
he
cleft
it
in
two
and
broke
his
armor
and
burst
his
girths
so
that
both
he
and
his
saddle
were
borne
to
the
ground
over
the
horse
crupper
and
geraint
dismounted
quickly
and
he
was
wroth
and
he
drew
his
sword
and
rushed
fiercely
upon
him
then
the
knight
also
arose
and
drew
his
sword
against
geraint
and
they
fought
on
foot
with
their
swords
until
their
arms
struck
sparks
of
fire
like
stars
from
one
another
and
thus
they
continued
fighting
until
the
blood
and
sweat
obscured
the
light
from
their
eyes
at
length
geraint
called
to
him
all
his
strength
and
struck
the
knight
upon
the
crown
of
his
head
so
that
he
broke
all
his
and
cut
through
all
the
flesh
and
the
skin
even
to
the
skull
until
he
wounded
the
bone
then
the
knight
fell
upon
his
knees
and
cast
his
sword
from
his
hand
and
besought
mercy
from
geraint
of
a
truth
said
he
i
relinquish
my
overdaring
and
my
pride
and
crave
thy
mercy
and
unless
i
have
time
to
commit
myself
to
heaven
for
my
sins
and
to
talk
with
a
priest
thy
mercy
will
avail
me
little
i
will
grant
thee
grace
upon
this
condition
said
geraint
that
thou
go
to
guenever
the
wife
of
arthur
to
do
her
satisfaction
for
the
insult
which
her
maiden
received
from
thy
dwarf
dismount
not
from
the
time
thou
goest
hence
until
thou
comest
into
the
presence
of
guenever
to
make
her
what
atonement
shall
be
adjudged
at
the
court
of
arthur
this
will
i
do
gladly
and
who
art
thou
i
am
geraint
the
son
of
erbin
and
declare
thou
also
who
thou
art
i
am
edeym
the
son
of
nudd
then
he
threw
himself
upon
his
horse
and
went
forward
to
arthur
court
and
the
lady
he
loved
best
went
before
him
and
the
dwarf
with
much
lamentation
then
came
the
young
earl
and
his
hosts
to
geraint
and
saluted
him
and
bade
him
to
his
castle
i
may
not
go
said
geraint
but
where
i
was
last
night
there
will
i
be
also
since
thou
wilt
none
of
my
inviting
thou
shalt
have
abundance
of
all
that
i
can
command
for
thee
and
i
will
order
ointment
for
thee
to
recover
thee
from
thy
fatigues
and
from
the
weariness
that
is
upon
thee
heaven
reward
thee
said
geraint
and
i
will
go
to
my
lodging
and
thus
went
geraint
and
earl
ynywl
and
his
wife
and
his
daughter
and
when
they
reached
the
old
mansion
the
household
servants
and
attendants
of
the
young
earl
had
arrived
and
had
arranged
all
the
apartments
dressing
them
with
straw
and
with
fire
and
in
a
short
time
the
ointment
was
ready
and
geraint
came
there
and
they
washed
his
head
then
came
the
young
earl
with
forty
honorable
knights
from
among
his
attendants
and
those
who
were
bidden
to
the
tournament
and
geraint
came
from
the
anointing
and
the
earl
asked
him
to
go
to
the
hall
to
eat
where
is
the
earl
ynywl
said
geraint
and
his
wife
and
his
daughter
they
are
in
the
chamber
yonder
said
the
earl
chamberlain
arraying
themselves
in
garments
which
the
earl
has
caused
to
be
brought
for
them
let
not
the
damsel
array
herself
said
he
except
in
her
vest
and
her
veil
until
she
come
to
the
court
of
arthur
to
be
clad
by
guenever
in
such
garments
as
she
may
choose
so
the
maiden
did
not
array
herself
then
they
all
entered
the
hall
and
they
washed
and
sat
down
to
meat
and
thus
were
they
seated
on
one
side
of
geraint
sat
the
young
earl
and
earl
ynywl
beyond
him
and
on
the
other
side
of
geraint
was
the
maiden
and
her
mother
and
after
these
all
sat
according
to
their
precedence
in
honor
and
they
ate
and
they
were
served
abundantly
and
they
received
a
profusion
of
divers
kinds
of
gifts
then
they
conversed
together
and
the
young
earl
invited
geraint
to
visit
him
next
day
i
will
not
by
heaven
said
geraint
to
the
court
of
arthur
will
i
go
with
this
maiden
and
it
is
enough
for
me
as
long
as
earl
ynywl
is
in
poverty
and
trouble
and
i
go
chiefly
to
seek
to
add
to
his
maintenance
ah
chieftain
said
the
young
earl
it
is
not
by
my
fault
that
earl
ynywl
is
without
his
possessions
by
my
faith
said
geraint
he
shall
not
remain
without
them
unless
death
quickly
takes
me
hence
o
chieftain
said
he
with
regard
to
the
disagreement
between
me
and
ynywl
i
will
gladly
abide
by
thy
counsel
and
agree
to
what
thou
mayest
judge
right
between
us
i
but
ask
thee
said
geraint
to
restore
to
him
what
is
his
and
what
he
should
have
received
from
the
time
he
lost
his
possessions
even
until
this
day
that
will
i
do
gladly
for
thee
answered
he
then
said
geraint
whosoever
is
here
who
owes
homage
to
ynywl
let
him
come
forward
and
perform
it
on
the
spot
and
all
the
men
did
so
and
by
that
treaty
they
abided
and
his
castle
and
his
town
and
all
his
possessions
were
restored
to
ynywl
and
he
received
back
all
that
he
had
lost
even
to
the
smallest
jewel
then
spoke
earl
ynywl
to
geraint
chieftain
said
he
behold
the
maiden
for
whom
thou
didst
challenge
at
the
tournament
i
bestow
her
upon
thee
she
shall
go
with
me
said
geraint
to
the
court
of
arthur
and
arthur
and
guenever
they
shall
dispose
of
her
as
they
will
and
the
next
day
they
proceeded
to
court
so
far
concerning
geraint
chapter
vi
geraint
the
son
of
erbin
continued
now
this
is
how
arthur
hunted
the
stag
the
men
and
the
dogs
were
divided
into
and
the
dogs
were
let
loose
upon
the
stag
and
the
last
dog
that
was
let
loose
was
the
favorite
dog
of
arthur
cavall
was
his
name
and
he
left
all
the
other
dogs
behind
him
and
turned
the
stag
and
at
the
second
turn
the
stag
came
toward
the
of
arthur
and
arthur
set
upon
him
and
before
he
could
be
slain
by
any
other
arthur
cut
off
his
head
then
they
sounded
the
for
slaying
and
they
all
gathered
round
they
came
kadyriath
to
arthur
and
spoke
to
him
lord
said
he
behold
yonder
is
guenever
and
none
with
her
save
only
one
maiden
command
gildas
the
son
of
caw
and
all
the
scholars
of
the
court
said
arthur
to
attend
guenever
to
the
palace
and
they
did
so
then
they
all
set
forth
holding
converse
together
concerning
the
head
of
the
stag
to
whom
it
should
be
given
one
wished
that
it
should
be
given
to
the
lady
best
beloved
by
him
and
another
to
the
lady
whom
he
loved
best
and
so
they
came
to
the
palace
and
when
arthur
and
guenever
heard
them
disputing
about
the
head
of
the
stag
guenever
said
to
arthur
my
lord
this
is
my
counsel
concerning
the
stag
head
let
it
not
be
given
away
until
geraint
the
son
of
erbin
shall
return
from
the
errand
he
is
upon
and
guenever
told
arthur
what
that
errand
was
right
gladly
shall
it
be
so
said
arthur
and
guenever
caused
a
watch
to
be
set
upon
the
ramparts
for
geraint
coming
and
after
midday
they
beheld
an
unshapely
little
man
upon
a
horse
and
after
him
a
dame
or
a
damsel
also
on
horseback
and
after
her
a
knight
of
large
stature
bowed
down
and
hanging
his
head
low
and
sorrowfully
and
clad
in
broken
and
worthless
armor
and
before
they
came
near
to
the
gate
one
of
the
watch
went
to
guenever
and
told
her
what
kind
of
people
they
saw
and
what
aspect
they
bore
i
know
not
who
they
are
said
he
but
i
know
said
guenever
this
is
the
knight
whom
geraint
pursued
and
methinks
that
he
comes
not
here
by
his
own
free
will
but
geraint
has
overtaken
him
and
avenged
the
insult
to
the
maiden
to
the
uttermost
and
thereupon
behold
a
porter
came
to
the
spot
where
guenever
was
lady
said
he
at
the
gate
there
is
a
knight
and
i
saw
never
a
man
of
so
pitiful
an
aspect
to
look
upon
as
he
miserable
and
broken
is
the
armor
that
he
wears
and
the
hue
of
blood
is
more
conspicuous
upon
it
than
its
own
color
knowest
thou
his
name
said
she
i
do
said
he
he
tells
me
that
he
is
edeyrn
the
son
of
nudd
then
she
replied
i
know
him
not
so
guenever
went
to
the
gate
to
meet
him
and
he
entered
and
guenever
was
sorry
when
she
saw
the
condition
he
was
in
even
though
he
was
accompanied
by
the
churlish
dwarf
then
edeyrn
saluted
guenever
heaven
protect
thee
said
she
lady
said
he
geraint
the
son
of
erbin
thy
best
and
most
valiant
servant
greets
thee
did
he
meet
with
thee
she
asked
yes
said
he
and
it
was
not
to
my
advantage
and
that
was
not
his
fault
but
mine
lady
and
geraint
greets
thee
well
and
in
greeting
thee
he
compelled
me
to
come
hither
to
do
thy
pleasure
for
the
insult
which
thy
maiden
received
from
the
dwarf
now
where
did
he
overtake
thee
at
the
place
where
we
were
jousting
and
contending
for
the
in
the
town
which
is
now
called
cardiff
and
it
was
for
the
avouchment
of
the
love
of
the
maiden
the
daughter
of
earl
ynywl
that
geraint
jousted
at
the
tournament
and
thereupon
we
encountered
each
other
and
he
left
me
lady
as
thou
seest
sir
said
she
when
thinkest
thou
that
geraint
will
be
here
lady
i
think
he
will
be
here
with
the
maiden
then
arthur
came
to
them
and
he
saluted
arthur
and
arthur
gazed
a
long
time
upon
him
and
was
amazed
to
see
him
thus
and
thinking
that
he
knew
him
he
inquired
of
him
art
thou
edeyrn
the
son
of
nudd
i
am
lord
said
he
and
i
have
met
with
much
trouble
and
received
wounds
unsupportable
then
he
told
arthur
all
his
adventure
well
said
arthur
from
what
i
hear
it
behooves
guenever
to
be
merciful
towards
thee
the
mercy
which
thou
desirest
lord
said
she
will
i
grant
to
him
since
it
is
as
insulting
to
thee
that
an
insult
should
be
offered
to
me
as
to
thyself
thus
will
it
be
best
to
do
said
arthur
let
this
man
have
medical
care
until
it
be
known
whether
he
may
live
and
if
he
live
he
shall
do
such
satisfaction
as
shall
be
judged
best
by
the
men
of
the
court
and
if
he
die
too
much
will
be
the
death
of
such
a
youth
as
edeyrn
for
an
insult
to
a
maiden
this
pleases
me
said
guenever
and
arthur
caused
morgan
tud
to
be
called
to
him
he
was
the
chief
physician
take
with
thee
edeyrn
the
son
of
nudd
and
cause
a
chamber
to
be
prepared
for
him
and
let
him
have
the
aid
of
medicine
as
thou
wouldst
do
unto
myself
if
i
were
wounded
and
let
none
into
his
chamber
to
molest
him
but
thyself
and
thy
disciples
to
administer
to
him
remedies
i
will
do
so
gladly
lord
said
morgan
tud
then
said
the
steward
of
the
household
whither
is
it
right
lord
to
order
the
maiden
to
guenever
and
her
handmaidens
said
he
and
the
steward
of
the
household
so
ordered
her
and
rising
up
he
rode
to
arthur
court
and
there
the
queen
forgave
him
easily
and
being
young
he
changed
himself
and
grew
to
hate
the
sin
that
seem
so
like
his
own
of
modred
arthur
nephew
and
fell
at
last
in
the
great
battle
fighting
for
the
king
enid
the
next
day
came
geraint
towards
the
court
and
there
was
a
watch
set
on
the
ramparts
by
guenever
lest
he
should
arrive
unawares
and
one
of
the
watch
came
to
guenever
lady
said
he
methinks
that
i
see
geraint
and
a
maiden
with
him
he
is
on
horseback
but
he
has
his
walking
gear
upon
him
and
the
maiden
appears
to
be
in
white
seeming
to
be
clad
in
a
garment
of
linen
assemble
all
the
women
said
guenever
and
come
to
meet
geraint
to
welcome
him
and
wish
him
joy
and
guenever
went
to
meet
geraint
and
the
maiden
and
when
geraint
came
to
the
place
where
guenever
was
he
saluted
her
heaven
prosper
thee
said
she
and
welcome
to
thee
lady
said
he
i
earnestly
desired
to
obtain
thee
satisfaction
according
to
thy
will
and
behold
here
is
the
maiden
through
whom
thou
hadst
thy
revenge
verily
said
guenever
the
welcome
of
heaven
be
unto
her
and
it
is
fitting
that
we
should
receive
her
joyfully
then
they
went
in
and
dismounted
and
geraint
came
to
where
arthur
was
and
saluted
him
heaven
protect
thee
said
arthur
and
the
welcome
of
heaven
be
unto
thee
and
inasmuch
as
thou
hast
vanquished
edeyrn
the
son
of
nudd
thou
hast
had
a
prosperous
career
not
upon
me
be
the
blame
said
geraint
it
was
through
the
arrogance
of
edeyrn
the
son
of
nudd
himself
that
we
were
not
friends
now
said
arthur
where
is
the
maiden
for
whom
i
heard
thou
didst
give
challenge
she
is
gone
with
guenever
to
her
chamber
then
went
arthur
to
see
the
maiden
and
arthur
and
all
his
companions
and
his
whole
court
were
glad
concerning
the
maiden
and
certain
were
they
all
that
had
her
array
been
suitable
to
her
beauty
they
had
never
seen
a
maid
fairer
than
she
and
arthur
gave
away
the
maiden
to
geraint
and
the
usual
bond
made
between
two
persons
was
made
between
geraint
and
the
maiden
and
the
choicest
of
all
guenever
apparel
was
given
to
the
maiden
and
thus
arrayed
she
appeared
comely
and
graceful
to
all
who
beheld
her
and
that
day
and
the
night
were
spent
in
abundance
of
minstrelsy
and
ample
gifts
of
liquor
and
a
multiude
of
games
and
when
it
was
time
for
them
to
go
to
sleep
they
went
and
in
the
chamber
where
the
couch
of
arthur
and
guenever
was
the
couch
of
geraint
and
enid
was
prepared
and
from
that
time
she
became
his
wife
and
the
next
day
arthur
satisfied
all
the
claimants
upon
geraint
with
bountiful
gifts
and
the
maiden
took
up
her
abode
in
the
palace
and
she
had
many
companions
both
men
and
women
and
there
was
no
maiden
more
esteemed
than
she
in
the
island
of
britain
then
spake
guenever
rightly
did
i
judge
said
she
concerning
the
head
of
the
stag
that
it
should
not
be
given
to
any
until
geraint
return
and
behold
here
is
a
fit
occasion
for
bestowing
it
let
it
be
given
to
enid
the
daughter
of
ynywl
the
most
illustrious
maiden
and
i
do
not
believe
that
any
will
begrudge
it
her
for
between
her
and
every
one
here
there
exists
nothing
but
love
and
friendship
much
applauded
was
this
by
them
all
and
by
arthur
also
and
the
head
of
the
stag
was
given
to
enid
and
thereupon
her
fame
increased
and
her
friends
became
more
in
number
than
before
and
geraint
from
that
time
forth
loved
the
hunt
and
the
tournament
and
hard
encounters
and
he
came
victorious
from
them
all
and
a
year
and
a
second
and
a
third
he
proceeded
thus
until
his
fame
had
flown
over
the
face
of
the
kingdom
and
once
upon
a
time
arthur
was
holding
his
court
at
caerleon
upon
usk
and
behold
there
came
to
him
ambassadors
wise
and
prudent
full
of
knowledge
and
eloquent
of
speech
and
they
saluted
arthur
heaven
prosper
you
said
arthur
and
whence
do
you
come
we
come
lord
said
they
from
cornwall
and
we
are
ambassadors
from
erbin
the
son
of
custennin
thy
uncle
and
our
mission
is
unto
thee
and
he
greets
thee
well
as
an
uncle
should
greet
his
nephew
and
as
a
vassal
should
greet
his
lord
and
he
represents
unto
thee
that
he
waxes
heavy
and
feeble
and
is
advancing
in
years
and
the
neighboring
chiefs
knowing
this
grow
insolent
towards
him
and
covet
his
land
and
possessions
and
he
earnestly
beseeches
thee
lord
to
permit
geraint
his
son
to
return
to
him
to
protect
his
possessions
and
to
become
acquainted
with
his
boundaries
and
unto
him
he
represents
that
it
were
better
for
him
to
spend
the
flower
of
his
youth
and
the
prime
of
his
age
in
preserving
his
own
boundaries
than
in
tournaments
which
are
productive
of
no
profit
although
he
obtains
glory
in
them
well
said
arthur
go
and
divest
yourselves
of
your
accoutrements
and
take
food
and
refresh
yourselves
after
your
fatigues
and
before
you
go
from
hence
you
shall
have
an
answer
and
they
went
to
eat
and
arthur
considered
that
it
would
go
hard
with
him
to
let
geraint
depart
from
him
and
from
his
court
neither
did
he
think
it
fair
that
his
cousin
should
be
restrained
from
going
to
protect
his
dominions
and
his
boundaries
seeing
that
his
father
was
unable
to
do
so
no
less
was
the
grief
and
regret
of
guenever
and
all
her
women
and
all
her
damsels
through
fear
that
the
maiden
would
leave
them
and
that
day
and
that
night
were
spent
in
abundance
of
feasting
and
arthur
told
geraint
the
cause
of
the
mission
and
of
the
coming
of
the
ambassadors
to
him
out
of
cornwall
truly
said
geraint
be
it
to
my
advantage
or
disadvantage
lord
i
will
do
according
to
thy
will
concerning
this
embassy
behold
said
arthur
though
it
grieves
me
to
part
with
thee
it
is
my
counsel
that
thou
go
to
dwell
in
thine
own
dominions
and
to
defend
thy
boundaries
and
take
with
thee
to
accompany
thee
as
many
as
thou
wilt
of
those
thou
lovest
best
among
my
faithful
ones
and
among
thy
friends
and
among
thy
companions
in
arms
heaven
reward
thee
and
this
will
i
do
said
geraint
what
discourse
said
guenever
do
i
hear
between
you
is
it
of
those
who
are
to
conduct
geraint
to
his
country
it
is
said
arthur
then
is
it
needful
for
me
to
consider
said
she
concerning
companions
and
a
provision
for
the
lady
that
is
with
me
thou
wilt
do
well
said
arthur
and
that
night
they
went
to
sleep
and
the
next
day
the
ambassadors
were
permitted
to
depart
and
they
were
told
that
geraint
should
follow
them
and
on
the
third
day
geraint
set
forth
and
many
went
with
him
gawain
the
son
of
gwyar
and
riogoned
the
son
of
the
king
of
ireland
and
ondyaw
the
son
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
gwilim
the
son
of
the
ruler
of
the
franks
howel
the
son
of
the
earl
of
brittany
perceval
the
son
of
evrawk
gwyr
a
judge
in
the
court
of
arthur
bedwyr
the
son
of
bedrawd
kai
the
son
of
kyner
odyar
the
frank
and
ederyn
the
son
of
nudd
said
geraint
i
think
i
shall
have
enough
of
knighthood
with
me
and
they
set
forth
and
never
was
there
seen
a
fairer
host
journeying
towards
the
severn
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
severn
were
the
nobles
of
erbin
the
son
of
custennin
and
his
at
their
head
to
welcome
geraint
with
gladness
and
many
of
the
women
of
the
court
with
his
mother
came
to
receive
enid
the
daughter
of
ynywl
his
wife
and
there
was
great
rejoicing
and
gladness
throughout
the
whole
court
and
through
all
the
country
concerning
geraint
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
love
to
him
and
of
the
greatness
of
the
fame
which
he
had
gained
since
he
went
from
amongst
them
and
because
he
was
come
to
take
possession
of
his
dominions
and
to
preserve
his
boundaries
and
they
came
to
the
court
and
in
the
court
they
had
ample
entertainment
and
a
multitude
of
gifts
and
abundance
of
liquor
and
a
sufficiency
of
service
and
a
variety
of
games
and
to
do
honor
to
geraint
all
the
chief
men
of
the
country
were
invited
that
night
to
visit
him
and
they
passed
that
day
and
that
night
in
the
utmost
enjoyment
and
at
dawn
next
day
erbin
arose
and
summoned
to
him
geraint
and
the
noble
persons
who
had
borne
him
company
and
he
said
to
geraint
i
am
a
feeble
and
an
aged
man
and
whilst
i
was
able
to
maintain
the
dominion
for
thee
and
for
myself
i
did
so
but
thou
art
young
and
in
the
flower
of
thy
vigor
and
of
thy
youth
henceforth
do
thou
preserve
thy
possessions
truly
said
geraint
with
my
consent
thou
shalt
not
give
the
power
over
thy
dominions
at
this
time
into
my
hands
and
thou
shalt
not
take
me
from
arthur
court
into
thy
hands
will
i
give
them
said
erbin
and
this
day
also
shalt
thou
receive
the
homage
of
thy
subjects
then
said
gawain
it
were
better
for
thee
to
satisfy
those
who
have
boons
to
ask
and
thou
canst
receive
the
homage
of
thy
dominions
so
all
that
had
boons
to
ask
were
summoned
into
one
place
and
kadyriath
came
to
them
to
know
what
were
their
requests
and
every
one
asked
that
which
he
desired
and
the
followers
of
arthur
began
to
make
gifts
and
immediately
the
men
of
cornwall
came
and
gave
also
and
they
were
not
long
in
giving
so
eager
was
every
one
to
bestow
gifts
and
of
those
who
came
to
ask
gifts
none
departed
unsatisfied
and
that
day
and
that
night
were
spent
in
the
utmost
enjoyment
and
the
next
day
at
dawn
erbin
desired
geraint
to
send
messengers
to
the
men
to
ask
them
whether
it
was
displeasing
to
them
that
he
should
come
to
receive
their
homage
and
whether
they
had
anything
to
object
to
him
then
geraint
sent
ambassadors
to
the
men
of
cornwall
to
ask
them
this
and
they
all
said
that
it
would
be
the
fulness
of
joy
and
honor
to
them
for
geraint
to
come
and
receive
their
homage
so
he
received
the
homage
of
such
as
were
there
and
the
day
after
the
followers
of
arthur
intended
to
go
away
it
is
too
soon
for
you
to
go
away
yet
said
he
stay
with
me
until
i
have
finished
receiving
the
homage
of
my
chief
men
who
have
agreed
to
come
to
me
and
they
remained
with
him
until
he
had
done
so
then
they
set
forth
towards
the
court
of
arthur
and
geraint
went
to
bear
them
company
and
enid
also
as
far
as
diganwy
there
they
parted
and
ondyaw
the
son
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
said
to
geraint
go
now
and
visit
the
uttermost
parts
of
thy
dominions
and
see
well
to
the
boundaries
of
thy
territories
and
if
thou
hast
any
trouble
respecting
them
send
unto
thy
companions
heaven
reward
thee
said
geraint
and
this
will
i
do
and
geraint
journeyed
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
his
dominions
and
experienced
guides
and
the
chief
men
of
his
country
went
with
him
and
the
furthermost
point
that
they
showed
him
he
kept
possession
of
chapter
vii
geraint
the
son
of
erbin
continued
geraint
as
he
had
been
used
to
do
when
he
was
at
arthur
court
frequented
tournaments
and
he
became
acquainted
with
valiant
and
mighty
men
until
he
had
gained
as
much
fame
there
as
he
had
formerly
done
elsewhere
and
he
enriched
his
court
and
his
companions
and
his
nobles
with
the
best
horses
and
the
best
arms
and
with
the
best
and
most
valuable
jewels
and
he
ceased
not
until
his
fame
had
flown
over
the
face
of
the
whole
kingdom
before
geraint
the
scourge
of
the
enemy
i
saw
steeds
white
with
foam
and
after
the
shout
of
battle
a
fearful
torrent
hen
when
he
knew
that
it
was
thus
he
began
to
love
ease
and
pleasure
for
there
was
no
one
who
was
worth
his
opposing
and
he
loved
his
wife
and
liked
to
continue
in
the
palace
with
minstrelsy
and
diversions
so
he
began
to
shut
himself
up
in
the
chamber
of
his
wife
and
he
took
no
delight
in
anything
besides
insomuch
that
he
gave
up
the
friendship
of
his
nobles
together
with
his
hunting
and
his
amusements
and
lost
the
hearts
of
all
the
host
in
his
court
and
there
was
murmuring
and
scoffing
concerning
him
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
palace
on
account
of
his
relinquishing
so
completely
their
companionship
for
the
love
of
his
wife
they
began
to
scoff
and
jeer
and
babble
of
him
as
of
a
prince
whose
manhood
was
all
gone
and
molten
down
in
mere
uxoriousness
these
tidings
came
to
erbin
and
when
erbin
had
heard
these
things
he
spoke
unto
enid
and
inquired
of
her
whether
it
was
she
that
had
caused
geraint
to
act
thus
and
to
forsake
his
people
and
his
hosts
not
i
by
my
confession
unto
heaven
said
she
there
is
nothing
more
hateful
unto
me
than
this
and
she
knew
not
what
she
should
do
for
although
it
was
hard
for
her
to
own
this
to
geraint
yet
was
it
not
more
easy
for
her
to
listen
to
what
she
heard
without
warning
geraint
concerning
it
and
she
was
very
sorrowful
one
morning
in
the
they
were
upon
their
couch
and
geraint
lay
upon
the
edge
of
it
and
enid
was
without
sleep
in
the
apartment
which
had
windows
of
glass
footnote
the
terms
of
admiration
in
which
the
older
writers
invariably
speak
of
glass
windows
would
be
sufficient
proof
if
other
evidence
were
wanting
how
rare
an
article
of
luxury
they
were
in
the
houses
of
our
ancestors
they
were
first
introduced
in
ecclesiastical
architecture
to
which
they
were
for
a
long
time
confined
glass
is
said
not
to
have
been
employed
in
domestic
architecture
before
the
fourteenth
century
and
the
sun
shone
upon
the
couch
and
the
clothes
had
slipped
from
off
his
arms
and
his
breast
and
he
was
asleep
then
she
gazed
upon
the
marvellous
beauty
of
his
appearance
and
she
said
alas
and
am
i
the
cause
that
these
arms
and
this
breast
have
lost
their
glory
and
the
warlike
fame
which
they
once
so
richly
enjoyed
as
she
said
this
the
tears
dropped
from
her
eyes
and
they
fell
upon
his
breast
and
the
tears
she
shed
and
the
words
she
had
spoken
awoke
him
and
another
thing
contributed
to
awaken
him
and
that
was
the
idea
that
it
was
not
in
thinking
of
him
that
she
spoke
thus
but
that
it
was
because
she
loved
some
other
man
more
than
him
and
that
she
wished
for
other
society
thereupon
geraint
was
troubled
in
his
mind
and
he
called
his
squire
and
when
he
came
to
him
go
quickly
said
he
and
prepare
my
horse
and
my
arms
and
make
them
ready
and
do
thou
rise
said
he
to
enid
and
apparel
thyself
and
cause
thy
horse
to
be
accoutred
and
clothe
thee
in
the
worst
that
thou
hast
in
thy
possession
and
evil
betide
me
said
he
if
thou
returnest
here
until
thou
knowest
whether
i
have
lost
my
strength
so
completely
as
thou
didst
say
and
if
it
be
so
it
will
then
be
easy
for
thee
to
seek
the
society
thou
didst
wish
for
of
him
of
whom
thou
wast
thinking
so
she
arose
and
clothed
herself
in
her
meanest
garments
i
know
nothing
lord
said
she
of
thy
meaning
neither
wilt
thou
know
at
this
time
said
he
then
geraint
went
to
see
erbin
sir
said
he
i
am
going
upon
a
quest
and
i
am
not
certain
when
i
may
come
back
take
heed
therefore
unto
thy
possessions
until
my
return
i
will
do
so
said
he
but
it
is
strange
to
me
that
thou
shouldst
go
so
suddenly
and
who
will
proceed
with
thee
since
thou
art
not
strong
enough
to
traverse
the
land
of
loegyr
alone
but
one
person
only
will
go
with
me
heaven
counsel
thee
my
son
said
erbin
and
may
many
attach
themselves
to
thee
in
loegyr
then
went
geraint
to
the
place
where
his
horse
was
and
it
was
equipped
with
foreign
armor
heavy
and
shining
and
he
desired
enid
to
mount
her
horse
and
to
ride
forward
and
to
keep
a
long
way
before
him
and
whatever
thou
mayst
see
and
whatever
thou
mayst
hear
concerning
me
said
he
do
thou
not
turn
back
and
unless
i
speak
unto
thee
say
not
thou
one
word
either
so
they
set
forward
and
he
did
not
choose
the
pleasantest
and
most
frequented
road
but
that
which
was
the
wildest
and
most
beset
by
thieves
and
robbers
and
venomous
animals
and
they
came
to
a
high
road
which
they
followed
till
they
saw
a
vast
forest
and
they
saw
four
armed
horsemen
come
forth
from
the
forest
when
the
armed
men
saw
them
they
said
one
to
another
here
is
a
good
occasion
for
us
to
capture
two
horses
and
armor
and
a
lady
likewise
for
this
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
doing
against
yonder
single
knight
who
hangs
his
head
so
pensively
and
heavily
enid
heard
this
discourse
and
she
knew
not
what
she
should
do
through
fear
of
geraint
who
had
told
her
to
be
silent
the
vengeance
of
heaven
be
upon
me
said
she
if
i
would
not
rather
receive
my
death
from
his
hand
than
from
the
hand
of
any
other
and
though
he
should
slay
me
yet
will
i
speak
to
him
lest
i
should
have
the
misery
to
witness
his
death
so
she
waited
for
geraint
until
he
came
near
to
her
lord
said
she
didst
thou
hear
the
words
of
those
men
concerning
thee
then
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
angrily
thou
hadst
only
said
he
to
hold
thy
peace
as
i
bade
thee
i
wish
but
for
silence
and
not
for
warning
and
though
thou
shouldst
desire
to
see
my
defeat
and
my
death
by
the
hands
of
those
men
yet
do
i
feel
no
dread
then
the
foremost
of
them
couched
his
lance
and
rushed
upon
geraint
and
he
received
him
and
that
not
feebly
but
he
let
the
thrust
go
by
him
while
he
struck
the
horseman
upon
the
centre
of
his
shield
in
such
a
manner
that
his
shield
was
split
and
his
armor
broken
so
that
a
cubit
length
of
the
shaft
of
geraint
lance
passed
through
his
body
and
sent
him
to
the
earth
the
length
of
the
lance
over
his
horse
crupper
then
the
second
horseman
attacked
him
furiously
being
wroth
at
the
death
of
his
companion
but
with
one
thrust
geraint
overthrew
him
also
and
killed
him
as
he
had
done
the
other
then
the
third
set
upon
him
and
he
killed
him
in
like
manner
and
thus
also
he
slew
the
fourth
sad
and
sorrowful
was
the
maiden
as
she
saw
all
this
geraint
dismounted
his
horse
and
took
the
arms
of
the
men
he
had
slain
and
placed
them
upon
their
saddles
and
tied
together
the
reins
of
their
horses
and
he
mounted
his
horse
again
behold
what
thou
must
do
said
he
take
the
four
horses
and
drive
them
before
thee
and
proceed
forward
as
i
bade
thee
just
now
and
say
not
one
word
unto
me
unless
i
speak
first
unto
thee
and
i
declare
unto
heaven
said
he
if
thou
doest
not
thus
it
will
be
to
thy
cost
i
will
do
as
far
as
i
can
lord
said
she
according
to
thy
desire
so
the
maiden
went
forward
keeping
in
advance
of
geraint
as
he
had
desired
her
and
it
grieved
him
as
much
as
his
wrath
would
permit
to
see
a
maiden
so
illustrious
as
she
having
so
much
trouble
with
the
care
of
the
horses
then
they
reached
a
wood
and
it
was
both
deep
and
vast
and
in
the
wood
night
overtook
them
ah
maiden
said
he
it
is
vain
to
attempt
proceeding
forward
well
lord
said
she
whatever
thou
wishest
we
will
do
it
will
be
best
for
us
he
answered
to
rest
and
wait
for
the
day
in
order
to
pursue
our
journey
that
we
will
gladly
said
she
and
they
did
so
having
dismounted
himself
he
took
her
down
from
her
horse
i
can
not
by
any
means
refrain
from
sleep
through
weariness
said
he
do
thou
therefore
watch
the
horses
and
sleep
not
i
will
lord
said
she
then
he
went
to
sleep
in
his
armor
and
thus
passed
the
night
which
was
not
long
at
that
season
and
when
she
saw
the
dawn
of
day
appear
she
looked
around
her
to
see
if
he
were
waking
and
thereupon
he
woke
then
he
arose
and
said
unto
her
take
the
horses
and
ride
on
and
keep
straight
on
as
thou
didst
yesterday
and
they
left
the
wood
and
they
came
to
an
open
country
with
meadows
on
one
hand
and
mowers
mowing
the
meadows
and
there
was
a
river
before
them
and
the
horses
bent
down
and
drank
of
the
water
and
they
went
up
out
of
the
river
by
a
lofty
steep
and
there
they
met
a
slender
stripling
with
a
satchel
about
his
neck
and
they
saw
that
there
was
something
in
the
satchel
but
they
knew
not
what
it
was
and
he
had
a
small
blue
pitcher
in
his
hand
and
a
bowl
on
the
mouth
of
the
pitcher
and
the
youth
saluted
geraint
heaven
prosper
thee
said
geraint
and
whence
dost
thou
come
i
come
said
he
from
the
city
that
lies
before
thee
my
lord
he
added
will
it
be
displeasing
to
thee
if
i
ask
whence
thou
comest
also
by
no
means
through
yonder
wood
did
i
come
thou
camest
not
through
the
wood
no
he
replied
we
were
in
the
wood
last
night
i
warrant
said
the
youth
that
thy
condition
there
last
night
was
not
the
most
pleasant
and
that
thou
hadst
neither
meat
nor
drink
no
by
my
faith
said
he
wilt
thou
follow
my
counsel
said
the
youth
and
take
thy
meal
from
me
what
sort
of
meal
he
inquired
the
breakfast
which
is
sent
for
yonder
mowers
nothing
less
than
bread
and
meat
and
wine
and
if
thou
wilt
sir
they
shall
have
none
of
it
i
will
said
he
and
heaven
reward
thee
for
it
so
geraint
alighted
and
the
youth
took
the
maiden
from
off
her
horse
then
they
washed
and
took
their
repast
and
the
youth
cut
the
bread
in
slices
and
gave
them
drink
and
served
them
withal
and
when
they
had
finished
the
youth
arose
and
said
to
geraint
my
lord
with
thy
permission
i
will
now
go
and
fetch
some
food
for
the
mowers
go
first
to
the
town
said
geraint
and
take
a
lodging
for
me
in
the
best
place
that
thou
knowest
and
the
most
commodious
one
for
the
horses
and
take
thou
whichever
horse
and
arms
thou
choosest
in
payment
for
thy
service
and
thy
gift
heaven
reward
thee
lord
said
the
youth
and
this
would
be
ample
to
repay
services
much
greater
than
those
i
have
rendered
unto
thee
and
to
the
town
went
the
youth
and
he
took
the
best
and
the
most
pleasant
lodgings
that
he
knew
and
after
that
he
went
to
the
palace
having
the
horse
and
armor
with
him
and
proceeded
to
the
place
where
the
earl
was
and
told
him
all
his
adventure
i
go
now
lord
said
he
to
meet
the
knight
and
to
conduct
him
to
his
lodging
go
gladly
said
the
earl
and
right
joyfully
shall
he
be
received
here
if
he
so
come
and
the
youth
went
to
meet
geraint
and
told
him
that
he
would
be
received
gladly
by
the
earl
in
his
own
palace
but
he
would
go
only
to
his
lodgings
and
he
had
a
goodly
chamber
in
which
was
plenty
of
straw
and
drapery
and
a
spacious
and
commodious
place
he
had
for
the
horses
and
the
youth
prepared
for
them
plenty
of
provender
after
they
had
disarrayed
themselves
geraint
spoke
thus
to
enid
go
said
he
to
the
other
side
of
the
chamber
and
come
not
to
this
side
of
the
house
and
thou
mayst
call
to
thee
the
woman
of
the
house
if
thou
wilt
i
will
do
lord
said
she
as
thou
sayest
thereupon
the
man
of
the
house
came
to
geraint
and
welcomed
him
and
after
they
had
eaten
and
drank
geraint
went
to
sleep
and
so
did
enid
also
in
the
evening
behold
the
earl
came
to
visit
geraint
and
his
twelve
honorable
knights
with
him
and
geraint
rose
up
and
welcomed
him
then
they
all
sat
down
according
to
their
precedence
in
honor
and
the
earl
conversed
with
geraint
and
inquired
of
him
the
object
of
his
journey
i
have
none
he
replied
but
to
seek
adventures
and
to
follow
mine
own
inclination
then
the
earl
cast
his
eye
upon
enid
and
he
looked
at
her
steadfastly
and
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
maiden
fairer
or
more
comely
than
she
and
he
set
all
his
thoughts
and
his
affections
upon
her
then
he
asked
of
geraint
have
i
thy
permission
to
go
and
converse
with
yonder
maiden
for
i
see
that
she
is
apart
from
thee
thou
hast
it
gladly
said
he
so
the
earl
went
to
the
place
where
the
maiden
was
and
spake
with
her
ah
maiden
said
he
it
can
not
be
pleasant
to
thee
to
journey
with
yonder
man
it
is
not
unpleasant
to
me
said
she
thou
hast
neither
youths
nor
maidens
to
serve
thee
said
he
truly
she
replied
it
is
more
pleasant
for
me
to
follow
yonder
man
than
to
be
served
by
youths
and
maidens
i
will
give
thee
good
counsel
said
he
all
my
earldom
will
i
place
in
thy
possession
if
thou
wilt
dwell
with
me
enid
the
pilot
star
of
my
lone
life
enid
my
early
and
my
only
love
enid
that
will
i
not
by
heaven
she
said
yonder
man
was
the
first
to
whom
my
faith
was
ever
pledged
and
shall
i
prove
inconstant
to
him
thou
art
in
the
wrong
said
the
earl
if
i
slay
the
man
yonder
i
can
keep
thee
with
me
as
long
as
i
choose
and
when
thou
no
longer
pleasest
me
i
can
turn
thee
away
but
if
thou
goest
with
me
by
thy
own
i
protest
that
our
union
shall
continue
as
long
as
i
remain
alive
then
she
pondered
those
words
of
his
and
she
considered
that
it
was
advisable
to
encourage
him
in
his
request
behold
then
chieftain
this
is
most
expedient
for
thee
to
do
to
save
me
from
all
reproach
come
here
and
take
me
away
as
though
i
knew
nothing
thereof
i
will
do
so
said
he
so
he
arose
and
took
his
leave
and
went
forth
with
his
attendants
and
she
told
not
then
to
geraint
any
of
the
conversation
which
she
had
had
with
the
earl
lest
it
should
rouse
his
anger
and
cause
him
uneasiness
and
care
and
at
the
usual
hour
they
went
to
sleep
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
night
enid
slept
a
little
and
at
midnight
she
arose
and
placed
all
geraint
armor
together
so
that
it
might
be
ready
to
put
on
and
although
fearful
of
her
errand
she
came
to
the
side
of
geraint
bed
and
she
spoke
to
him
softly
and
gently
saying
my
lord
arise
and
clothe
thyself
for
these
were
the
words
of
the
earl
to
me
and
his
intention
concerning
me
so
she
told
geraint
all
that
had
passed
and
although
he
was
wroth
with
her
he
took
warning
and
clothed
himself
and
she
lighted
a
candle
that
he
might
have
light
to
do
so
leave
there
the
candle
said
he
and
desire
the
man
of
the
house
to
come
here
then
she
went
and
the
man
of
the
house
came
to
him
dost
thou
know
how
much
i
owe
thee
asked
geraint
i
think
thou
owest
but
little
take
the
three
horses
and
the
three
suits
of
armor
heaven
reward
thee
lord
said
he
but
i
spent
not
the
value
of
one
suit
of
armor
upon
thee
for
that
reason
said
he
thou
wilt
be
the
richer
and
now
wilt
thou
come
to
guide
me
out
of
the
town
i
will
gladly
said
he
and
in
which
direction
dost
thou
intend
to
go
i
wish
to
leave
the
town
by
a
different
way
from
that
by
which
i
entered
it
so
the
man
of
the
lodgings
accompanied
him
as
far
as
he
desired
then
he
bade
the
maiden
to
go
on
before
him
and
she
did
so
and
went
straight
forward
and
his
host
returned
home
and
geraint
and
the
maiden
went
forward
along
the
and
as
they
journeyed
thus
they
heard
an
exceeding
loud
wailing
near
to
them
stay
thou
here
said
he
and
i
will
go
and
see
what
is
the
cause
of
this
wailing
i
will
said
she
then
he
went
forward
into
an
open
glade
that
was
near
the
road
and
in
the
glade
he
saw
two
horses
one
having
a
man
saddle
and
the
other
a
woman
saddle
upon
it
and
behold
there
was
a
knight
lying
dead
in
his
armor
and
a
young
damsel
in
a
standing
over
him
lamenting
ah
lady
said
geraint
what
hath
befallen
thee
behold
she
answered
i
journeyed
here
with
my
beloved
husband
when
lo
three
giants
came
upon
us
and
without
any
cause
in
the
world
they
slew
him
which
way
went
they
hence
said
geraint
yonder
by
the
she
replied
so
he
returned
to
enid
go
said
he
to
the
lady
that
is
below
yonder
and
await
me
there
till
i
come
she
was
sad
when
he
ordered
her
to
do
thus
but
nevertheless
she
went
to
the
damsel
whom
it
was
ruth
to
hear
and
she
felt
certain
that
geraint
would
never
return
meanwhile
geraint
followed
the
giants
and
overtook
them
and
each
of
them
was
greater
in
stature
than
three
other
men
and
a
huge
club
was
on
the
shoulder
of
each
then
he
rushed
upon
one
of
them
and
thrust
his
lance
through
his
body
and
having
drawn
it
forth
again
he
pierced
another
of
them
through
likewise
but
the
third
turned
upon
him
and
struck
him
with
his
club
so
that
he
split
his
shield
and
crushed
his
shoulder
but
geraint
drew
his
sword
and
gave
the
giant
a
blow
on
the
crown
of
his
head
so
severe
and
fierce
and
violent
that
his
head
and
his
neck
were
split
down
to
his
shoulders
and
he
fell
dead
so
geraint
left
him
thus
and
returned
to
enid
and
when
he
reached
the
place
where
she
was
he
fell
down
lifeless
from
his
horse
piercing
and
loud
and
thrilling
was
the
cry
that
enid
uttered
and
she
came
and
stood
over
him
where
he
had
fallen
and
at
the
sound
of
her
cries
came
the
earl
of
limours
and
they
who
journeyed
with
him
whom
her
lamentations
brought
out
of
their
road
and
the
earl
said
to
enid
alas
lady
what
hath
befallen
thee
ah
good
sir
said
she
the
only
man
i
have
loved
or
ever
shall
love
is
slain
then
he
said
to
the
other
and
what
is
the
cause
of
thy
grief
they
have
slain
my
beloved
husband
also
said
she
and
who
was
it
that
slew
them
some
giants
she
answered
slew
my
and
the
other
knight
went
in
pursuit
of
them
and
came
back
in
the
state
thou
seest
the
earl
caused
the
knight
that
was
dead
to
be
buried
but
he
thought
that
there
still
remained
some
life
in
geraint
and
to
see
if
he
yet
would
live
he
had
him
carried
with
him
in
the
hollow
of
his
shield
and
upon
a
bier
and
the
two
damsels
went
to
the
court
and
when
they
arrived
there
geraint
was
placed
upon
a
little
couch
in
front
of
the
table
that
was
in
the
hall
then
they
all
took
off
their
and
the
earl
besought
enid
to
do
the
same
and
to
clothe
herself
in
other
garments
i
will
not
by
heaven
said
she
ah
lady
said
he
be
not
so
sorrowful
for
this
matter
it
were
hard
to
persuade
me
to
be
otherwise
said
she
i
will
act
towards
thee
in
such
wise
that
thou
needest
not
be
sorrowful
whether
yonder
knight
live
or
die
behold
a
good
earldom
together
with
myself
will
i
bestow
upon
thee
be
therefore
happy
and
joyful
i
declare
to
heaven
said
she
that
henceforth
i
shall
never
be
joyful
while
i
live
come
said
he
and
eat
no
by
heaven
i
will
not
but
by
heaven
thou
shalt
said
he
so
he
took
her
with
him
to
the
table
against
her
will
and
many
times
desired
her
to
eat
i
call
heaven
to
witness
said
she
that
i
will
not
until
the
man
that
is
upon
yonder
bier
shall
eat
likewise
thou
canst
not
fulfil
that
said
the
earl
yonder
man
is
dead
already
i
will
prove
that
i
can
said
she
then
he
offered
her
a
goblet
of
liquor
drink
this
goblet
he
said
and
it
will
cause
thee
to
change
thy
mind
evil
betide
me
she
answered
if
i
drink
aught
until
he
drink
also
truly
said
the
earl
it
is
of
no
more
avail
for
me
to
be
gentle
with
thee
than
ungentle
and
he
gave
her
a
box
in
the
ear
thereupon
she
raised
a
loud
and
piercing
shriek
and
her
lamentations
were
much
greater
than
they
had
been
before
for
she
considered
in
her
mind
that
had
geraint
been
alive
he
durst
not
have
struck
her
thus
but
behold
at
the
sound
of
her
cry
geraint
revived
from
his
swoon
and
he
sat
upon
the
bier
and
finding
his
sword
in
the
hollow
of
his
shield
he
rushed
to
the
place
where
the
earl
was
and
struck
him
a
and
blow
upon
the
crown
of
his
head
so
that
he
clove
him
in
twain
until
his
sword
was
staid
by
the
table
then
all
left
the
board
and
fled
away
and
this
was
not
so
much
through
fear
of
the
living
as
through
the
dread
they
felt
at
seeing
the
dead
man
rise
up
to
slay
them
and
geraint
looked
upon
enid
and
he
was
grieved
for
two
causes
one
was
to
see
that
enid
had
lost
her
color
and
her
wonted
aspect
and
the
other
to
know
that
she
was
in
the
right
lady
said
he
knowest
thou
where
our
horses
are
i
know
lord
where
thy
horse
is
she
replied
but
i
know
not
where
is
the
other
thy
horse
is
in
the
house
yonder
so
he
went
to
the
house
and
brought
forth
his
horse
and
mounted
him
and
took
up
enid
and
placed
her
upon
the
horse
with
him
and
he
rode
forward
and
their
road
lay
between
two
hedges
and
the
night
was
gaining
on
the
day
and
lo
they
saw
behind
them
the
shafts
of
spears
betwixt
them
and
the
sky
and
they
heard
the
tramping
of
horses
and
the
noise
of
a
host
approaching
i
hear
something
following
us
said
he
and
i
will
put
thee
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
and
thus
he
did
and
thereupon
behold
a
knight
pricked
towards
him
and
couched
his
lance
when
enid
saw
this
she
cried
out
saying
o
chieftain
whoever
thou
art
what
renown
wilt
thou
gain
by
slaying
a
dead
man
o
heaven
said
he
is
it
geraint
yes
in
truth
said
she
and
who
art
thou
i
am
gwiffert
petit
said
he
thy
husband
ally
coming
to
thy
assistance
for
i
heard
that
thou
wast
in
trouble
come
with
me
to
the
court
of
a
of
my
sister
which
is
near
here
and
thou
shalt
have
the
best
medical
assistance
in
the
kingdom
i
will
do
so
gladly
said
geraint
and
enid
was
placed
upon
the
horse
of
one
of
gwiffert
squires
and
they
went
forward
to
the
baron
palace
and
they
were
received
there
with
gladness
and
they
met
with
hospitality
and
attention
the
next
morning
they
went
to
seek
physicians
and
it
was
not
long
before
they
came
and
they
attended
geraint
until
he
was
perfectly
well
and
while
geraint
was
under
medical
care
gwiffert
caused
his
armor
to
be
repaired
until
it
was
as
good
as
it
had
ever
been
and
they
remained
there
a
month
and
a
fortnight
then
they
separated
and
geraint
went
towards
his
own
dominions
and
thenceforth
he
reigned
prosperously
and
his
warlike
fame
and
splendor
lasted
with
renown
and
honor
both
to
him
and
to
enid
from
that
time
forward
footnote
throughout
the
broad
and
varied
region
of
romance
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
character
of
greater
simplicity
and
truth
than
that
of
enid
the
daughter
of
earl
ynywl
conspicuous
for
her
beauty
and
noble
bearing
we
are
at
a
loss
whether
more
to
admire
the
patience
with
which
she
bore
all
the
hardships
she
was
destined
to
undergo
or
the
constancy
and
affection
which
finally
achieved
the
truimph
she
so
richly
deserved
the
character
of
enid
is
admirably
sustained
through
the
whole
tale

as
it
is
more
natural
because
less
overstrained
so
perhaps
it
is
even
more
touching
than
that
of

over
which
however
chaucer
has
thrown
a
charm

story
chapter
viii
pwyll
prince
of
dyved
once
upon
a
time
pwyll
was
at
narberth
his
chief
palace
where
a
feast
had
been
prepared
for
him
and
with
him
was
a
great
host
of
men
and
after
the
first
meal
pwyll
arose
to
walk
and
he
went
to
the
top
of
a
mound
that
was
above
the
palace
and
was
called
gorsedd
arberth
lord
said
one
of
the
court
it
is
peculiar
to
the
mound
that
whosoever
sits
upon
it
can
not
go
thence
without
either
receiving
wounds
or
blows
or
else
seeing
a
wonder
i
fear
not
to
receive
wounds
or
blows
said
pwyll
but
as
to
the
wonder
gladly
would
i
see
it
i
will
therefore
go
and
sit
upon
the
mound
and
upon
the
mound
he
sat
and
while
he
sat
there
they
saw
a
lady
on
a
pure
white
horse
of
large
size
with
a
garment
of
shining
gold
around
her
coming
along
the
highway
that
led
from
the
mound
my
men
said
pwyll
is
there
any
among
you
who
knows
yonder
lady
there
is
not
lord
said
they
go
one
of
you
and
meet
her
that
we
may
know
who
she
is
and
one
of
them
arose
and
as
he
came
upon
the
road
to
meet
her
she
passed
by
and
he
followed
as
fast
as
he
could
being
on
foot
and
the
greater
was
his
speed
the
further
was
she
from
him
and
when
he
saw
that
it
profited
him
nothing
to
follow
her
he
returned
to
pwyll
and
said
unto
him
lord
it
is
idle
for
any
one
in
the
world
to
follow
her
on
foot
verily
said
pwyll
go
unto
the
palace
and
take
the
fleetest
horse
that
thou
seest
and
go
after
her
and
he
took
a
horse
and
went
forward
and
he
came
to
an
open
level
plain
and
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
the
more
he
urged
his
horse
the
further
was
she
from
him
and
he
returned
to
the
place
where
pwyll
was
and
said
lord
it
will
avail
nothing
for
any
one
to
follow
yonder
lady
i
know
of
no
horse
in
these
realms
swifter
than
this
and
it
availed
me
not
to
pursue
her
of
a
truth
said
pwyll
there
must
be
some
illusion
here
let
us
go
towards
the
palace
so
to
the
palace
they
went
and
spent
the
day
and
the
next
day
they
amused
themselves
until
it
was
time
to
go
to
meat
and
when
meat
was
ended
pwyll
said
where
are
the
hosts
that
went
yesterday
to
the
top
of
the
mound
behold
lord
we
are
here
said
they
let
us
go
said
he
to
the
mound
and
sit
there
and
do
thou
said
he
to
the
page
who
tended
his
horse
saddle
my
horse
well
and
hasten
with
him
to
the
road
and
bring
also
my
spurs
with
thee
and
the
youth
did
thus
and
they
went
and
sat
upon
the
mound
and
ere
they
had
been
there
but
a
short
time
they
beheld
the
lady
coming
by
the
same
road
and
in
the
same
manner
and
at
the
same
pace
young
man
said
pwyll
i
see
the
lady
coming
give
me
my
horse
and
before
he
had
mounted
his
horse
she
passed
him
and
he
turned
after
her
and
followed
her
and
he
let
his
horse
go
bounding
playfully
and
thought
that
he
should
soon
come
up
with
her
but
he
came
no
nearer
to
her
than
at
first
then
he
urged
his
horse
to
his
utmost
speed
yet
he
found
that
it
availed
not
then
said
pwyll
o
maiden
for
the
sake
of
him
whom
thou
best
lovest
stay
for
me
i
will
stay
gladly
said
she
and
it
were
better
for
thy
horse
hadst
thou
asked
it
long
since
so
the
maiden
stopped
and
she
threw
back
that
part
of
her
which
covered
her
face
then
he
thought
that
the
beauty
of
all
the
maidens
and
all
the
ladies
that
he
had
ever
seen
was
as
nothing
compared
to
her
beauty
lady
he
said
wilt
thou
tell
me
aught
concerning
thy
purpose
i
will
tell
thee
said
she
my
chief
quest
was
to
see
thee
truly
said
pwyll
this
is
to
me
the
most
pleasing
quest
on
which
thou
couldst
have
come
and
wilt
thou
tell
me
who
thou
art
i
will
tell
thee
lord
said
she
i
am
rhiannon
the
daughter
of
heveydd
and
they
sought
to
give
me
a
husband
against
my
will
but
no
husband
would
i
have
and
that
because
of
my
love
for
thee
neither
will
i
yet
have
one
unless
thou
reject
me
and
hither
have
i
come
to
hear
thy
answer
by
heaven
said
pwyll
behold
this
is
my
answer
if
i
might
choose
among
all
the
ladies
and
damsels
in
the
world
thee
would
i
choose
verily
said
she
if
thou
art
thus
minded
make
a
pledge
to
meet
me
ere
i
am
given
to
another
the
sooner
i
may
do
so
the
more
pleasing
will
it
be
to
me
said
pwyll
and
wheresoever
thou
wilt
there
will
i
meet
with
thee
i
will
that
thou
meet
me
this
day
twelvemonth
at
the
palace
of
heveydd
gladly
said
he
will
i
keep
this
tryst
so
they
parted
and
he
went
back
to
his
hosts
and
to
them
of
his
household
and
whatsoever
questions
they
asked
him
respecting
the
damsel
he
always
turned
the
discourse
upon
other
matters
and
when
a
year
from
that
time
was
gone
he
caused
a
hundred
knights
to
equip
themselves
and
to
go
with
him
to
the
palace
of
heveydd
and
he
came
to
the
palace
and
there
was
great
joy
concerning
him
with
much
concourse
of
people
and
great
rejoicing
and
vast
preparations
for
his
coming
and
the
whole
court
was
placed
under
his
orders
and
the
hall
was
garnished
and
they
went
to
meat
and
thus
did
they
sit
heveydd
was
on
one
side
of
pwyll
and
rhiannon
on
the
other
and
all
the
rest
according
to
their
rank
and
they
ate
and
feasted
and
talked
one
with
another
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
carousal
after
the
meat
there
entered
a
tall
youth
of
royal
bearing
clothed
in
a
garment
of
satin
and
when
he
came
into
the
hall
he
saluted
pwyll
and
his
companions
the
greeting
of
heaven
be
unto
thee
said
pwyll
come
thou
and
sit
down
nay
said
he
a
suitor
am
i
and
i
will
do
my
errand
do
so
willingly
said
pwyll
lord
said
he
my
errand
is
unto
thee
and
it
is
to
crave
a
boon
of
thee
that
i
come
what
boon
soever
thou
mayest
ask
of
me
so
far
as
i
am
able
thou
shalt
have
ah
said
rhiannon
wherefore
didst
thou
give
that
answer
has
he
not
given
it
before
the
presence
of
these
nobles
asked
the
youth
my
soul
said
pwyll
what
is
the
boon
thou
askest
the
lady
whom
best
i
love
is
to
be
thy
bride
this
night
i
come
to
ask
her
of
thee
with
the
feast
and
the
banquet
that
are
in
this
place
and
pwyll
was
silent
because
of
the
promise
which
he
had
given
be
silent
as
long
as
thou
wilt
said
rhiannon
never
did
man
make
worse
use
of
his
wits
than
thou
hast
done
lady
said
he
i
knew
not
who
he
was
behold
this
is
the
man
to
whom
they
would
have
given
me
against
my
will
said
she
and
he
is
gawl
the
son
of
clud
a
man
of
great
power
and
wealth
and
because
of
the
word
thou
hast
spoken
bestow
me
upon
him
lest
shame
befall
thee
lady
said
he
i
understand
not
thy
answer
never
can
i
do
as
thou
sayest
bestow
me
upon
him
said
she
and
i
will
cause
that
i
shall
never
be
his
by
what
means
will
that
be
asked
pwyll
then
she
told
him
the
thought
that
was
in
her
mind
and
they
talked
long
together
then
gawl
said
lord
it
is
meet
that
i
have
an
answer
to
my
request
as
much
of
that
thou
hast
asked
as
it
is
in
my
power
to
give
thou
shalt
have
replied
pwyll
my
soul
said
rhiannon
unto
gawl
as
for
the
feast
and
the
banquet
that
are
here
i
have
bestowed
them
upon
the
men
of
dyved
and
the
household
and
the
warriors
that
are
with
us
these
can
i
not
suffer
to
be
given
to
any
in
a
year
from
a
banquet
shall
be
prepared
for
thee
in
this
palace
that
i
may
become
thy
bride
so
gawl
went
forth
to
his
possessions
and
pwyll
went
also
back
to
dyved
and
they
both
spent
that
year
until
it
was
the
time
for
the
feast
at
the
palace
of
heveydd
then
gawl
the
son
of
clud
set
out
to
the
feast
that
was
prepared
for
him
and
he
came
to
the
palace
and
was
received
there
with
rejoicing
pwyll
also
the
chief
of
dyved
came
to
the
orchard
with
a
hundred
knights
as
rhiannon
had
commanded
him
and
pwyll
was
clad
in
coarse
and
ragged
garments
and
wore
large
clumsy
old
shoes
upon
his
feet
and
when
he
knew
that
the
carousal
after
the
meat
had
begun
he
went
toward
the
hall
and
when
he
came
into
the
hall
he
saluted
gawl
the
son
of
clud
and
his
company
both
men
and
women
heaven
prosper
thee
said
gawl
and
friendly
greeting
be
unto
thee
lord
said
he
may
heaven
reward
thee
i
have
an
errand
unto
thee
welcome
be
thine
errand
and
if
thou
ask
of
me
that
which
is
right
thou
shalt
have
it
gladly
it
is
fitting
answered
he
i
crave
but
from
want
and
the
boon
i
ask
is
to
have
this
small
bag
that
thou
seest
filled
with
meat
a
request
within
reason
is
this
said
he
and
gladly
shalt
thou
have
it
bring
him
food
a
great
number
of
attendants
arose
and
began
to
fill
the
bag
but
for
all
they
put
into
it
it
was
no
fuller
than
at
first
my
soul
said
gawl
will
thy
bag
ever
be
full
it
will
not
i
declare
to
heaven
said
he
for
all
that
may
be
put
into
it
unless
one
possessed
of
lands
and
domains
and
treasure
shall
arise
and
tread
down
with
both
his
feet
the
food
that
is
within
the
bag
and
shall
say
has
been
put
therein
then
said
rhiannon
unto
gawl
the
son
of
clud
rise
up
quickly
i
will
willingly
arise
said
he
so
he
rose
up
and
put
his
two
feet
into
the
bag
and
pwyll
turned
up
the
sides
of
the
bag
so
that
gawl
was
over
his
head
in
it
and
he
shut
it
up
quickly
and
slipped
a
knot
upon
the
thongs
and
blew
his
horn
and
thereupon
behold
his
knights
came
down
upon
the
palace
and
they
seized
all
the
host
that
had
come
with
gawl
and
cast
them
into
his
own
prison
and
pwyll
threw
off
his
rags
and
his
old
shoes
and
his
tattered
array
and
as
they
came
in
every
one
of
pwyll
knights
struck
a
blow
upon
the
bag
and
asked
what
is
here
a
badger
said
they
and
in
this
manner
they
played
each
of
them
striking
the
bag
either
with
his
foot
or
with
a
staff
and
thus
played
they
with
the
bag
and
then
was
the
game
of
badger
in
the
bag
first
played
lord
said
the
man
in
the
bag
if
thou
wouldst
but
hear
me
i
merit
not
to
be
slain
in
a
bag
said
heveydd
lord
he
speaks
truth
it
were
fitting
that
thou
listen
to
him
for
he
deserves
not
this
verily
said
pwyll
i
will
do
thy
counsel
concerning
him
behold
this
is
my
counsel
then
said
rhiannon
thou
art
now
in
a
position
in
which
it
behooves
thee
to
satisfy
suitors
and
minstrels
let
him
give
unto
them
in
thy
stead
and
take
a
pledge
from
him
that
he
will
never
seek
to
revenge
that
which
has
been
done
to
him
and
this
will
be
punishment
enough
i
will
do
this
gladly
said
the
man
in
the
bag
and
gladly
will
i
accept
it
said
pwyll
since
it
is
the
counsel
of
heveydd
and
rhiannon
seek
thyself
sureties
we
will
be
for
him
said
heveydd
until
his
men
be
free
to
answer
for
him
and
upon
this
he
was
let
out
of
the
bag
and
his
liegemen
were
liberated
verily
lord
said
gawl
i
am
greatly
hurt
and
i
have
many
bruises
with
thy
leave
i
will
go
forth
i
will
leave
nobles
in
my
stead
to
answer
for
me
in
all
that
thou
shalt
require
willingly
said
pwyll
mayest
thou
do
this
so
gawl
went
to
his
own
possessions
and
the
hall
was
set
in
order
for
pwyll
and
the
men
of
his
host
and
for
them
also
of
the
palace
and
they
went
to
the
tables
and
sat
down
and
as
they
had
sat
that
time
twelvemonth
so
sat
they
that
night
and
they
ate
and
feasted
and
spent
the
night
in
mirth
and
tranquility
and
the
time
came
that
they
should
sleep
and
pwyll
and
rhiannon
went
to
their
chamber
and
next
morning
at
break
of
day
my
lord
said
rhiannon
arise
and
begin
to
give
thy
gifts
unto
the
minstrels
refuse
no
one
day
that
may
claim
thy
bounty
thus
shall
it
be
gladly
said
pwyll
both
and
every
day
while
the
feast
shall
last
so
pwyll
arose
and
he
caused
silence
to
be
proclaimed
and
desired
all
the
suitors
and
minstrels
to
show
and
to
point
out
what
gifts
they
desired
and
this
being
done
the
feast
went
on
and
he
denied
no
one
while
it
lasted
and
when
the
feast
was
ended
pwyll
said
unto
heveydd
my
lord
with
thy
permission
i
will
set
out
for
dyved
certainly
said
heveydd
may
heaven
prosper
thee
fix
also
a
time
when
rhiannon
shall
follow
thee
by
heaven
said
pwyll
we
will
go
hence
together
willest
thou
this
lord
said
heveydd
yes
lord
answered
pwyll
and
the
next
day
they
set
forward
towards
dyved
and
journeyed
to
the
palace
of
narberth
where
a
feast
was
made
ready
for
them
and
there
came
to
them
great
numbers
of
the
chief
men
and
the
most
noble
ladies
of
the
land
and
of
these
there
were
none
to
whom
rhiannon
did
not
give
some
rich
gift
either
a
bracelet
or
a
ring
or
a
precious
stone
and
they
ruled
the
land
prosperously
that
year
and
the
next
chapter
ix
branwen
the
daughter
of
llyr
bendigeid
vran
the
son
of
llyr
was
the
crowned
king
of
this
island
and
he
was
exalted
from
the
crown
of
london
and
one
afternoon
he
was
at
harlech
in
ardudwy
at
his
court
and
he
sat
upon
the
rock
of
harlech
looking
over
the
sea
and
with
him
were
his
brother
manawyddan
the
son
of
llyr
and
his
brothers
by
the
mother
side
nissyen
and
evnissyen
and
many
nobles
likewise
as
was
fitting
to
see
around
a
king
his
two
brothers
by
the
side
were
the
sons
of
euroswydd
and
one
of
these
youths
was
a
good
youth
and
of
gentle
nature
and
would
make
peace
between
his
kindred
and
cause
his
family
to
be
friends
when
their
wrath
was
at
the
highest
and
this
one
was
nissyen
but
the
other
would
cause
strife
between
his
two
brothers
when
they
were
most
at
peace
and
as
they
sat
thus
they
beheld
thirteen
ships
coming
from
the
south
of
ireland
and
making
towards
them
and
they
came
with
a
swift
motion
the
wind
being
behind
them
and
they
neared
them
rapidly
i
see
ships
afar
said
the
king
coming
swiftly
towards
the
land
command
the
men
of
the
court
that
they
equip
themselves
and
go
and
learn
their
intent
so
the
men
equipped
themselves
and
went
down
towards
them
and
when
they
saw
the
ships
near
certain
were
they
that
they
had
never
seen
ships
better
furnished
beautiful
flags
of
satin
were
upon
them
and
behold
one
of
the
ships
outstripped
the
others
and
they
saw
a
shield
lifted
up
above
the
side
of
the
ship
and
the
point
of
the
shield
was
upwards
in
token
of
peace
and
the
men
drew
near
that
they
might
hold
converse
then
they
put
out
boats
and
came
toward
the
land
and
they
saluted
the
king
now
the
king
could
hear
them
from
the
place
where
he
was
upon
the
rock
above
their
heads
heaven
prosper
you
said
he
and
be
ye
welcome
to
whom
do
these
ships
belong
and
who
is
the
chief
amongst
you
lord
said
they
matholch
king
of
ireland
is
here
and
these
ships
belong
to
him
wherefore
comes
he
asked
the
king
and
will
he
come
to
the
land
he
is
a
suitor
unto
thee
lord
said
they
and
he
will
not
land
unless
he
have
his
boon
and
what
may
that
be
inquired
the
king
he
desires
to
ally
himself
lord
with
thee
said
they
and
he
comes
to
ask
branwen
the
daughter
of
llyr
that
if
it
seem
well
to
thee
the
island
of
the
mighty
footnote
the
island
of
the
mighty
is
one
of
the
many
names
bestowed
upon
britain
by
the
welsh
may
be
leagued
with
ireland
and
both
become
more
powerful
verily
said
he
let
him
come
to
land
and
we
will
take
counsel
thereupon
and
this
answer
was
brought
to
matholch
i
will
go
willingly
said
he
so
he
landed
and
they
received
him
joyfully
and
great
was
the
throng
in
the
palace
that
night
between
his
hosts
and
those
of
the
court
and
next
day
they
took
counsel
and
they
resolved
to
bestow
branwen
upon
matholch
now
she
was
one
of
the
three
chief
ladies
of
this
island
and
she
was
the
fairest
damsel
in
the
world
and
they
fixed
upon
aberfraw
as
the
place
where
she
should
become
his
bride
and
they
went
thence
and
towards
aberfraw
the
hosts
proceeded
matholch
and
his
host
in
their
ships
bendigeid
vran
and
his
host
by
land
until
they
came
to
aberfraw
and
at
aberfraw
they
began
the
feast
and
sat
down
and
thus
sat
they
the
king
of
the
island
of
the
mighty
and
manawyddan
the
son
of
llyr
on
one
side
and
matholch
on
the
other
side
and
branwen
the
daughter
of
llyr
beside
him
and
they
were
not
within
a
house
but
under
tents
no
house
could
ever
contain
bendigeid
vran
and
they
began
the
banquet
and
caroused
and
discoursed
and
when
it
was
more
pleasing
to
them
to
sleep
than
to
carouse
they
went
to
rest
and
branwen
became
matholch
bride
and
next
day
they
arose
and
all
they
of
the
court
and
the
officers
began
to
equip
and
to
range
the
horses
and
the
attendants
and
they
ranged
them
in
order
as
far
as
the
sea
and
behold
one
day
evnissyen
the
quarrelsome
man
of
whom
it
is
spoken
above
came
by
chance
into
the
place
where
the
horses
of
matholch
were
and
asked
whose
horses
they
might
be
they
are
the
horses
of
matholch
king
of
ireland
who
is
married
to
branwen
thy
sister
his
horses
are
they
and
is
it
thus
they
have
done
with
a
maiden
such
as
she
and
moreover
my
sister
bestowing
her
without
my
consent
they
could
have
offered
no
greater
insult
to
me
than
this
said
he
and
thereupon
he
rushed
under
the
horses
and
cut
off
their
lips
at
the
teeth
and
their
ears
close
to
their
heads
and
their
tails
close
to
their
backs
and
he
disfigured
the
horses
and
rendered
them
useless
and
they
came
with
these
tidings
unto
matholch
saying
that
the
horses
were
disfigured
and
injured
so
that
not
one
of
them
could
ever
be
of
any
use
again
verily
lord
said
one
it
was
an
insult
unto
thee
and
as
such
was
it
meant
of
a
truth
it
is
a
marvel
to
me
that
if
they
desire
to
insult
me
they
should
have
given
me
a
maiden
of
such
high
rank
and
so
much
beloved
of
her
kindred
as
they
have
done
lord
said
another
thou
seest
that
thus
it
is
and
there
is
nothing
for
thee
to
do
but
to
go
to
thy
ships
and
thereupon
towards
his
ships
he
set
out
and
tidings
came
to
bendigeid
vran
that
matholch
was
quitting
the
court
without
asking
leave
and
messengers
were
sent
to
inquire
of
him
wherefore
he
did
so
and
the
messengers
that
went
were
iddic
the
son
of
anarawd
and
heveyd
hir
and
these
overtook
him
and
asked
of
him
what
he
designed
to
do
and
wherefore
he
went
forth
of
a
truth
said
he
if
i
had
known
i
had
not
come
hither
i
have
been
altogether
insulted
no
one
had
ever
worse
treatment
than
i
have
had
here
truly
lord
it
was
not
the
will
of
any
that
are
of
the
court
said
they
nor
of
any
that
are
of
the
council
that
thou
shouldst
have
received
this
insult
and
as
thou
hast
been
insulted
the
dishonor
is
greater
unto
bendigeid
vran
than
unto
thee
verily
said
he
i
think
so
nevertheless
he
can
not
recall
the
insult
these
men
returned
with
that
answer
to
the
place
where
bendigeid
vran
was
and
they
told
him
what
reply
matholch
had
given
them
truly
said
he
there
are
no
means
by
which
we
may
prevent
his
going
away
at
enmity
with
us
that
we
will
not
take
well
lord
said
they
send
after
him
another
embassy
i
will
do
so
said
he
arise
manawyddan
son
of
llyr
and
heveyd
hir
and
go
after
him
and
tell
him
that
he
shall
have
a
sound
horse
for
every
one
that
has
been
injured
and
beside
that
as
an
atonement
for
the
insult
he
shall
have
a
staff
of
silver
as
large
and
as
tall
as
himself
and
a
plate
of
gold
of
the
breadth
of
his
face
and
show
unto
him
who
it
was
that
did
this
and
that
it
was
done
against
my
will
but
that
he
who
did
it
is
my
brother
and
therefore
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
put
him
to
death
and
let
him
come
and
meet
me
said
he
and
we
will
make
peace
in
any
way
he
may
desire
the
embassy
went
after
matholch
and
told
him
all
these
sayings
in
a
friendly
manner
and
he
listened
thereunto
men
said
he
i
will
take
counsel
so
to
the
council
he
went
and
in
the
council
they
considered
that
if
they
should
refuse
this
they
were
likely
to
have
more
shame
rather
than
to
obtain
so
great
an
atonement
they
resolved
therefore
to
accept
it
and
they
returned
to
the
court
in
peace
then
the
pavilions
and
the
tents
were
set
in
order
after
the
fashion
of
a
hall
and
they
went
to
meat
and
as
they
had
sat
at
the
beginning
of
the
feast
so
sat
they
there
and
matholch
and
bendigeid
vran
began
to
discourse
and
behold
it
seemed
to
bendigeid
vran
while
they
talked
that
matholch
was
not
so
cheerful
as
he
had
been
before
and
he
thought
that
the
chieftain
might
be
sad
because
of
the
smallness
of
the
atonement
which
he
had
for
the
wrong
that
had
been
done
him
o
man
said
bendigeid
vran
thou
dost
not
discourse
so
cheerfully
as
thou
wast
wont
and
if
it
be
because
of
the
smallness
of
the
atonement
thou
shalt
add
thereunto
whatsoever
thou
mayest
choose
and
i
will
pay
thee
for
the
horses
lord
said
he
heaven
reward
thee
and
i
will
enhance
the
atonement
said
bendigeid
vran
for
i
will
give
unto
thee
a
caldron
the
property
of
which
is
that
if
one
of
thy
men
be
slain
and
be
cast
therein
morrow
he
will
be
as
well
as
ever
he
was
at
the
best
except
that
he
will
not
regain
his
speech
and
thereupon
he
gave
him
great
thanks
and
very
joyful
was
he
for
that
cause
that
night
they
continued
to
discourse
as
much
as
they
would
and
had
minstrelsy
and
carousing
and
when
it
was
more
pleasant
to
them
to
sleep
than
to
sit
longer
they
went
to
rest
and
thus
was
the
banquet
carried
on
with
joyousness
and
when
it
was
finished
matholch
journeyed
towards
ireland
and
branwen
with
him
and
they
went
from
aber
menei
with
thirteen
ships
and
came
to
ireland
and
in
ireland
was
there
great
joy
because
of
their
coming
and
not
one
great
man
nor
noble
lady
visited
branwen
unto
whom
she
gave
not
either
a
clasp
or
a
ring
or
a
royal
jewel
to
keep
such
as
it
was
honorable
to
be
seen
departing
with
and
in
these
things
she
spent
that
year
in
much
renown
and
she
passed
her
time
pleasantly
enjoying
honor
and
friendship
and
in
due
time
a
son
was
born
unto
her
and
the
name
that
they
gave
him
was
gwern
the
son
of
matholch
and
they
put
the
boy
out
to
be
nursed
in
a
place
where
were
the
best
men
of
ireland
and
behold
in
the
second
year
a
tumult
arose
in
ireland
on
account
of
the
insult
which
matholch
had
received
in
wales
and
the
payment
made
him
for
his
horses
and
his
and
such
as
were
nearest
to
him
blamed
him
openly
for
that
matter
and
he
might
have
no
peace
by
reason
of
the
tumult
until
they
should
revenge
upon
him
this
disgrace
and
the
vengeance
which
they
took
was
to
drive
away
branwen
from
the
same
chamber
with
him
and
to
make
her
cook
for
the
court
and
they
caused
the
butcher
after
he
had
cut
up
the
meat
to
come
to
her
and
give
her
every
day
a
blow
on
the
ear
and
such
they
made
her
punishment
verily
lord
said
his
men
to
matholch
forbid
now
the
ships
and
the
and
the
coracles
that
they
go
not
into
wales
and
such
as
come
over
from
wales
hither
imprison
them
that
they
go
not
back
for
this
thing
to
be
known
there
and
he
did
so
and
it
was
thus
for
no
less
than
three
years
and
branwen
reared
a
starling
in
the
cover
of
the
and
she
taught
it
to
speak
and
she
taught
the
bird
what
manner
of
man
her
brother
was
and
she
wrote
a
letter
of
her
woes
and
the
despite
with
which
she
was
treated
and
she
bound
the
letter
to
the
root
of
the
bird
wing
and
sent
it
toward
wales
and
the
bird
came
to
that
island
and
one
day
it
found
bendigeid
vran
at
caer
seiont
in
arvon
conferring
there
and
it
alighted
upon
his
shoulder
and
ruffled
its
feathers
so
that
the
letter
was
seen
and
they
knew
that
the
bird
had
been
reared
in
a
domestic
manner
then
bendigeid
vran
took
the
letter
and
looked
upon
it
and
when
he
had
read
the
letter
he
grieved
exceedingly
at
the
tidings
of
branwen
woes
and
immediately
he
began
sending
messengers
to
summon
the
island
together
and
he
caused
and
four
of
his
chief
men
to
come
unto
him
and
he
complained
to
them
of
the
grief
that
his
sister
endured
so
they
took
counsel
and
in
the
counsel
they
resolved
to
go
to
ireland
and
to
leave
seven
men
as
princes
at
home
and
caradoc
footnote
caractacus
the
son
of
bran
as
the
chief
of
them
bendigeid
vran
with
the
host
of
which
we
spoke
sailed
towards
ireland
and
it
was
not
far
across
the
sea
and
he
came
to
shoal
water
now
the
of
matholch
were
upon
the
and
they
came
to
matholch
lord
said
they
greeting
be
unto
thee
heaven
protect
you
said
he
have
you
any
news
lord
said
they
we
have
marvellous
news
a
wood
have
we
seen
upon
the
sea
in
a
place
where
we
never
yet
saw
a
single
tree
this
is
indeed
a
marvel
said
he
saw
you
aught
else
we
saw
lord
said
they
a
vast
mountain
beside
the
wood
which
moved
and
there
was
a
lofty
ridge
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
a
lake
on
each
side
of
the
ridge
and
the
wood
and
the
mountain
and
all
these
things
moved
verily
said
he
there
is
none
who
can
know
aught
concerning
this
unless
it
be
branwen
messengers
then
went
unto
branwen
lady
said
they
what
thinkest
thou
that
this
is
the
men
of
the
island
of
the
mighty
who
have
come
hither
on
hearing
of
my
and
of
my
woes
what
is
the
forest
that
is
seen
upon
the
sea
asked
they
the
yards
and
the
masts
of
ships
she
answered
alas
said
they
what
is
the
mountain
that
is
seen
by
the
side
of
the
ships
bendigeid
vran
my
brother
she
replied
coming
to
shoal
water
and
he
is
wading
to
the
land
what
is
the
lofty
ridge
with
the
lake
on
each
side
thereof
on
looking
towards
this
island
he
is
wroth
and
his
two
eyes
on
each
side
of
his
nose
are
the
two
lakes
on
each
side
of
the
ridge
the
warriors
and
chief
men
of
ireland
were
brought
together
in
haste
and
they
took
counsel
lord
said
the
neighbors
unto
matholch
there
is
no
other
counsel
than
this
alone
thou
shalt
give
the
kingdom
to
gwern
the
son
of
branwen
his
sister
as
a
compensation
for
the
wrong
and
despite
that
have
been
done
unto
branwen
and
he
will
make
peace
with
thee
and
in
the
council
it
was
resolved
that
this
message
should
be
sent
to
bendigeid
vran
lest
the
country
should
be
destroyed
and
this
peace
was
made
and
matholch
caused
a
great
house
to
be
built
for
bendigeid
vran
and
his
host
thereupon
came
the
hosts
into
the
house
the
men
of
the
island
of
ireland
entered
the
house
on
the
one
side
and
the
men
of
the
island
of
the
mighty
on
the
other
and
as
soon
as
they
had
sat
down
there
was
concord
between
them
and
the
sovereignty
was
conferred
upon
the
boy
when
the
peace
was
concluded
bendigeid
vran
called
the
boy
unto
him
and
from
bendigeid
vran
the
boy
went
unto
manawyddan
and
he
was
beloved
by
all
that
beheld
him
and
from
manawyddan
the
boy
was
called
by
nissyen
the
son
of
euroswydd
and
the
boy
went
unto
him
lovingly
wherefore
said
evnissyen
comes
not
my
nephew
the
son
of
my
sister
unto
me
though
he
were
not
king
of
ireland
yet
willingly
would
i
fondle
the
boy
cheerfully
let
him
go
to
thee
said
bendigeid
vran
and
the
boy
went
unto
him
cheerfully
by
my
confession
to
heaven
said
evnissyen
in
his
heart
unthought
of
is
the
slaughter
that
i
will
this
instant
commit
then
he
arose
and
took
up
the
boy
and
before
any
one
in
the
house
could
seize
hold
of
him
he
thrust
the
boy
headlong
into
the
blazing
fire
and
when
branwen
saw
her
son
burning
in
the
fire
she
strove
to
leap
into
the
fire
also
from
the
place
where
she
sat
between
her
two
brothers
but
bendigeid
vran
grasped
her
with
one
hand
and
his
shield
with
the
other
then
they
all
hurried
about
the
house
and
never
was
there
made
so
great
a
tumult
by
any
host
in
one
house
as
was
made
by
them
as
each
man
armed
himself
and
while
they
all
sought
their
arms
bendigeid
vran
supported
branwen
between
his
shield
and
his
shoulder
and
they
fought
then
the
irish
kindled
a
fire
under
the
caldron
of
renovation
and
they
cast
the
dead
bodies
into
the
caldron
until
it
was
full
and
the
next
day
they
came
forth
fighting
men
as
good
as
before
except
that
they
were
not
able
to
speak
then
when
evnissyen
saw
the
dead
bodies
of
the
men
of
the
island
of
the
mighty
nowhere
resuscitated
he
said
in
his
heart
alas
woe
is
me
that
i
should
have
been
the
cause
of
bringing
the
men
of
the
island
of
the
mighty
into
so
great
a
strait
evil
betide
me
if
i
find
not
a
deliverance
therefrom
and
he
cast
himself
among
the
dead
bodies
of
the
irish
and
two
unshod
irishmen
came
to
him
and
taking
him
to
be
one
of
the
irish
flung
him
into
the
caldron
and
he
stretched
himself
out
in
the
caldron
so
that
he
rent
the
caldron
into
four
pieces
and
burst
his
own
heart
also
in
consequence
of
this
the
men
of
the
island
of
the
mighty
obtained
such
success
as
they
had
but
they
were
not
victorious
for
only
seven
men
of
them
all
escaped
and
bendigeid
vran
himself
was
wounded
in
the
foot
with
a
poisoned
dart
now
the
men
that
escaped
were
pryderi
manawyddan
taliesin
and
four
others
and
bendigeid
vran
commanded
them
that
they
should
cut
off
his
head
and
take
you
my
head
said
he
and
bear
it
even
unto
the
white
mount
in
london
and
bury
it
there
with
the
face
towards
france
and
so
long
as
it
lies
there
no
enemy
shall
ever
land
on
the
island
so
they
cut
off
his
head
and
these
seven
went
forward
therewith
and
branwen
was
the
eighth
with
them
and
they
came
to
land
on
aber
alaw
and
they
sat
down
to
rest
and
branwen
looked
towards
ireland
and
towards
the
island
of
the
mighty
to
see
if
she
could
descry
them
alas
said
she
woe
is
me
that
i
was
ever
born
two
islands
have
been
destroyed
because
of
me
then
she
uttered
a
groan
and
there
broke
her
heart
and
they
made
her
a
grave
and
buried
her
upon
the
banks
of
the
alaw
then
the
seven
men
journeyed
forward
bearing
the
head
with
them
and
as
they
went
behold
there
met
them
a
multitude
of
men
and
women

pryderi
married
kicva
the

now
manawyddan
returned
from

in

and
he
found
that
his
cousin
had
seized
all
his
possessions
and
much
grief
and
heaviness
came
upon
him
alas
woe
is
me
he
exclaimed
there
is
none
save
myself
without
a
home
and
a
lord
said
pryderi
be
not
so
sorrowful
thy
cousin
is
king
of
the
island
of
the
mighty
and
though
he
has
done
thee
wrong
thou
hast
never
been
a
claimant
of
land
or
possessions
yea
answered
he
but
although
this
man
is
my
cousin
it
grieveth
me
to
see
any
one
in
the
place
of
my
brother
bendigeid
vran
neither
can
i
be
happy
in
the
same
dwelling
with
him
wilt
thou
follow
the
counsel
of
another
said
pryderi
i
stand
in
need
of
counsel
he
answered
and
what
may
that
counsel
be
seven
cantrevs
belong
unto
me
said
pryderi
wherein
rhiannon
my
mother
dwells
i
will
bestow
her
upon
thee
and
the
seven
cantrevs
with
her
and
though
thou
hadst
no
possessions
but
those
cantrevs
only
thou
couldst
not
have
any
fairer
than
they
do
thou
and
rhiannon
enjoy
them
and
if
thou
desire
any
possessions
thou
wilt
not
despise
these
i
do
not

i
will
go
with
thee
to

wilt
do
well
he
answered
and
i
believe
that
thou
didst
never
hear
a
lady
discourse
better
than
she
and
when
she
was
in
her
prime
none
was
ever
fairer
even
now
her
aspect
is
not
uncomely
they
set
forth
and
however
long
the
journey
they
came
at
last
to
dyved
and
a
feast
was
prepared
for
them
by
rhiannon
and
kicva
then
began
manawyddan
and
rhiannon
to
sit
and
to
talk
together
and
his
mind
and
his
thoughts
became
warmed
towards
her
and
he
thought
in
his
heart
he
had
never
beheld
any
lady
more
fulfilled
of
grace
and
beauty
than
she
pryderi
said
he
i

may
heaven
reward
him
who
hath
shown
unto
me
friendship
so
perfect
as
this
and
before
the
feast
was
over
she
became
his
bride
said
pryderi
tarry
ye
here
the
rest
of
the
feast
and
i
will
go
into
england
to
tender
my
homage
unto
caswallawn
the
son
of
beli
lord
said
rhiannon
caswallawn
is
in
kent
thou
mayest
therefore
tarry
at
the
feast
and
wait
until
he
shall
be
nearer
we
will
wait
he
answered
so
they
finished
the
feast
and
they
began
to
make
the
circuit
of
dyved
and
to
hunt
and
to
take
their
pleasure
and
as
they
went
through
the
country
they
had
never
seen
lands
more
pleasant
to
live
in
nor
better
hunting
grounds
nor
greater
plenty
of
honey
and
fish
and
such
was
the
friendship
between
these
four
that
they
would
not
be
parted
from
each
other
by
night
nor
by
day
and
in
the
midst
of
all
this
he
went
to
caswallawn
at
oxford
and
tendered
his
homage
and
honorable
was
his
reception
there
and
highly
was
he
praised
for
offering
his
homage
and
after
his
return
pryderi
and
manawyddan
feasted
and
took
their
ease
and
pleasure
and
they
began
a
feast
at
narberth
for
it
was
the
chief
palace
and
when
they
had
ended
the
first
meal
while
those
who
served
them
ate
they
arose
and
went
forth
and
proceeded
to
the
gorsedd
that
is
the
mount
of
narberth
and
their
retinue
with
them
and
as
they
sat
thus
behold
a
peal
of
thunder
and
with
the
violence
of
the
lo
there
came
a
fall
of
mist
so
thick
that
not
one
of
them
could
see
the
other
and
after
the
mist
it
became
light
all
around
and
when
they
looked
towards
the
place
where
they
were
wont
to
see
the
cattle
and
herds
and
dwellings
they
saw
nothing
now
neither
house
nor
beast
nor
smoke
nor
fire
nor
man
nor
dwelling
but
the
buildings
of
the
court
empty
and
desert
and
uninhabited
without
either
man
or
beast
within
them
and
truly
all
their
companions
were
lost
to
them
without
their
knowing
aught
of
what
had
befallen
them
save
those
four
only
in
the
name
of
heaven
said
manawyddan
where
are
they
of
the
court
and
all
my
host
beside
let
us
go
and
see
so
they
came
to
the
castle
and
saw
no
man
and
into
the
hall
and
to
the
and
there
was
none
and
in
the
and
in
the
kitchen
there
was
naught
but
desolation
then
they
began
to
go
through
the
land
and
all
the
possessions
that
they
had
and
they
visited
the
houses
and
dwellings
and
found
nothing
but
wild
beasts
and
when
they
had
consumed
their
feast
and
all
their
provisions
they
fed
upon
the
prey
they
killed
in
hunting
and
the
honey
of
the
wild
swans
and
one
morning
pryderi
and
manawyddan
rose
up
to
hunt
and
they
ranged
their
dogs
and
went
forth
and
some
of
the
dogs
ran
before
them
and
came
to
a
bush
which
was
near
at
hand
but
as
soon
as
they
were
come
to
the
bush
they
hastily
drew
back
and
returned
to
the
men
their
hair
bristling
up
greatly
let
us
go
near
to
the
bush
said
pryderi
and
see
what
is
in
it
and
as
they
came
near
behold
a
wild
boar
of
a
pure
white
color
rose
up
from
the
bush
then
the
dogs
being
set
on
by
the
men
rushed
towards
him
but
he
left
the
bush
and
fell
back
a
little
way
from
the
men
and
made
a
stand
against
the
dogs
without
retreating
from
them
until
the
men
had
come
near
and
when
the
men
came
up
he
fell
back
a
second
time
and
betook
him
to
flight
then
they
pursued
the
boar
until
they
beheld
a
vast
and
lofty
castle
all
newly
built
in
a
place
where
they
had
never
before
seen
either
stone
or
building
and
the
boar
ran
swiftly
into
the
castle
and
the
dogs
after
him
now
when
the
boar
and
the
dogs
had
gone
into
the
castle
the
men
began
to
wonder
at
finding
a
castle
in
a
place
where
they
had
never
before
seen
any
building
whatsoever
and
from
the
top
of
the
gorsedd
they
looked
and
listened
for
the
dogs
but
so
long
as
they
were
there
they
heard
not
one
of
the
dogs
nor
aught
concerning
them
lord
said
pryderi
i
will
go
into
the
castle
to
get
tidings
of
the
dogs
truly
he
replied
thou
wouldst
be
unwise
to
go
into
this
castle
which
thou
hast
never
seen
till
now
if
thou
wouldst
follow
my
counsel
thou
wouldst
not
enter
therein
whosoever
has
cast
a
spell
over
this
land
has
caused
this
castle
to
be
here
of
a
truth
answered
pryderi
i
can
not
thus
give
up
my
dogs
and
for
all
the
counsel
that
manawyddan
gave
him
yet
to
the
castle
he
went
when
he
came
within
the
castle
neither
man
nor
beast
nor
boar
nor
dogs
nor
house
nor
dwelling
saw
he
within
it
but
in
the
centre
of
the
he
beheld
a
fountain
with
around
it
and
on
the
margin
of
the
fountain
a
golden
bowl
upon
a
marble
slab
and
chains
hanging
from
the
air
to
which
he
saw
no
end
and
he
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
beauty
of
the
gold
and
with
the
rich
workmanship
of
the
bowl
and
he
went
up
to
the
bowl
and
laid
hold
of
it
and
when
he
had
taken
hold
of
its
his
hands
stuck
to
the
bowl
and
his
feet
to
the
slab
on
which
the
bowl
was
placed
and
all
his
joyousness
forsook
him
so
that
he
could
not
utter
a
word
and
thus
he
stood
and
manawyddan
waited
for
him
till
near
the
close
of
the
day
and
late
in
the
evening
being
certain
that
he
should
have
no
tidings
of
pryderi
or
the
dogs
he
went
back
to
the
palace
and
as
he
entered
rhiannon
looked
at
him
where
said
she
are
thy
companion
and
thy
dogs
behold
he
answered
the
adventure
that
has
befallen
me
and
he
related
it
all
unto
her
an
evil
companion
hast
thou
been
said
rhiannon
and
a
good
companion
hast
thou
lost
and
with
that
word
she
went
out
and
proceeded
towards
the
castle
according
to
the
direction
which
he
gave
her
the
gate
of
the
castle
she
found
open
she
was
nothing
daunted
and
she
went
in
and
as
she
went
in
she
perceived
pryderi
laying
hold
of
the
bowl
and
she
went
towards
him
o
my
lord
said
she
what
dost
thou
here
and
she
took
hold
of
the
bowl
with
him
and
as
she
did
so
her
hands
also
became
fast
to
the
bowl
and
her
feet
to
the
slab
and
she
was
not
able
to
utter
a
word
and
with
that
as
it
became
night
lo
there
came
thunder
upon
them
and
a
fall
of
mist
and
thereupon
the
castle
vanished
and
they
with
it
when
kicva
the
daughter
of
gwynn
gloy
saw
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
palace
but
herself
and
manawyddan
she
sorrowed
so
that
she
cared
not
whether
she
lived
or
died
and
manawyddan
saw
this
thou
art
in
the
wrong
said
he
if
through
fear
of
me
thou
grievest
thus
i
call
heaven
to
witness
that
thou
hast
never
seen
friendship
more
pure
than
that
which
i
will
bear
thee
as
long
as
heaven
will
that
thou
shouldst
be
thus
i
declare
to
thee
that
were
i
in
the
dawn
of
youth
i
would
keep
my
faith
unto
pryderi
and
unto
thee
also
will
i
keep
it
be
there
no
fear
upon
thee
therefore
heaven
reward
thee
she
said
and
that
is
what
i
deemed
of
thee
and
the
damsel
thereupon
took
courage
and
was
glad
truly
lady
said
manawyddan
it
is
not
fitting
for
us
to
stay
here
we
have
lost
our
dogs
and
can
not
get
food
let
us
go
into
england
it
is
easiest
for
us
to
find
support
there
gladly
lord
said
she
we
will
do
so
and
they
set
forth
together
to
england
lord
said
she
what
craft
wilt
thou
follow
take
up
one
that
is
seemly
none
other
will
i
take
answered
he
but
that
of
making
shoes
lord
said
she
such
a
craft
becomes
not
a
man
so
nobly
born
as
thou
by
that
however
will
i
abide
said
he
i
know
nothing
thereof
said
kicva
but
i
know
answered
manawyddan
and
i
will
teach
thee
to
stitch
we
will
not
attempt
to
dress
the
leather
but
we
will
buy
it
ready
dressed
and
will
make
the
shoes
from
it
so
they
went
into
england
and
went
as
far
as
hereford
and
they
betook
themselves
to
making
shoes
and
he
began
by
buying
the
best
cordwain
that
could
be
had
in
the
town
and
none
other
would
buy
and
he
associated
himself
with
the
best
goldsmith
in
the
town
and
caused
him
to
make
clasps
for
the
shoes
and
to
gild
the
clasps
and
he
marked
how
it
was
done
until
he
learned
the
method
and
therefore
is
he
called
one
of
the
three
makers
of
gold
shoes
and
when
they
could
be
had
from
him
not
a
shoe
nor
hose
was
bought
of
any
of
the
cordwainers
in
the
town
but
when
the
cordwainers
perceived
that
their
gains
were
failing
for
as
manawyddan
shaped
the
work
so
kicva
stitched
it
they
came
together
and
took
counsel
and
agreed
that
they
would
slay
them
and
he
had
warning
thereof
and
it
was
told
him
how
the
cordwainers
had
agreed
together
to
slay
him
lord
said
kicva
wherefore
should
this
be
borne
from
these
boors
nay
said
he
we
will
go
back
unto
dyved
so
towards
dyved
they
set
forth
now
manawyddan
when
he
set
out
to
return
to
dyved
took
with
him
a
burden
of
wheat
and
he
proceeded
towards
narberth
and
there
he
dwelt
and
never
was
he
better
pleased
than
when
he
saw
narberth
again
and
the
lands
where
he
had
been
wont
to
hunt
with
pryderi
and
with
rhiannon
and
he
accustomed
himself
to
fish
and
to
hunt
the
deer
in
their
covert
and
then
he
began
to
prepare
some
ground
and
he
sowed
a
croft
and
a
second
and
a
third
and
no
wheat
in
the
world
ever
sprung
up
better
and
the
three
crofts
prospered
with
perfect
growth
and
no
man
ever
saw
fairer
wheat
than
it
and
thus
passed
the
seasons
of
the
year
until
the
harvest
came
and
he
went
to
look
at
one
of
his
crofts
and
behold
it
was
ripe
i
will
reap
this
said
he
and
that
night
he
went
back
to
narberth
and
on
the
morrow
in
the
gray
dawn
he
went
to
reap
the
croft
and
when
he
came
there
he
found
nothing
but
the
bare
straw
every
one
of
the
ears
of
the
wheat
was
cut
off
from
the
stalk
and
all
the
ears
carried
entirely
away
and
nothing
but
the
straw
left
and
at
this
he
marvelled
greatly
then
he
went
to
look
at
another
croft
and
behold
that
also
was
ripe
verily
said
he
this
will
i
reap
and
on
the
morrow
he
came
with
the
intent
to
reap
it
and
when
he
came
there
he
found
nothing
but
the
bare
straw
o
gracious
heaven
he
exclaimed
i
know
that
whosoever
has
begun
my
ruin
is
completing
it
and
has
also
destroyed
the
country
with
me
then
he
went
to
look
at
the
third
croft
and
when
he
came
there
finer
wheat
had
there
never
been
seen
and
this
also
was
ripe
evil
betide
me
said
he
if
i
watch
not
here
whoever
carried
off
the
other
corn
will
come
in
like
manner
to
take
this
and
i
will
know
who
it
is
and
he
told
kicva
all
that
had
befallen
verily
said
she
what
thinkest
thou
to
do
i
will
watch
the
croft
said
he
and
he
went
to
watch
the
croft
and
at
midnight
he
heard
something
stirring
among
the
wheat
and
he
looked
and
behold
the
mightiest
host
of
mice
in
the
world
which
could
neither
be
numbered
nor
measured
and
he
knew
not
what
it
was
until
the
mice
had
made
their
way
into
the
croft
and
each
of
them
climbing
up
the
straw
and
bending
it
down
with
its
weight
had
cut
off
one
of
the
ears
of
wheat
and
had
carried
it
away
leaving
there
the
stalk
and
he
saw
not
a
single
straw
there
that
had
not
a
mouse
to
it
and
they
all
took
their
way
carrying
the
ears
with
them
in
wrath
and
anger
did
he
rush
upon
the
mice
but
he
could
no
more
come
up
with
them
than
if
they
had
been
gnats
or
birds
of
the
air
except
one
only
which
though
it
was
but
sluggish
went
so
fast
that
a
man
on
foot
could
scarce
overtake
it
and
after
this
one
he
went
and
he
caught
it
and
put
it
in
his
glove
and
tied
up
the
opening
of
the
glove
with
a
string
and
kept
it
with
him
and
returned
to
the
palace
then
he
came
to
the
hall
where
kicva
was
and
he
lighted
a
fire
and
hung
the
glove
by
the
string
upon
a
peg
what
hast
thou
there
lord
said
kicva
a
thief
said
he
that
i
found
robbing
me
what
kind
of
a
thief
may
it
be
lord
that
thou
couldst
put
into
thy
glove
said
she
then
he
told
her
how
the
mice
came
to
the
last
of
the
fields
in
his
sight
and
one
of
them
was
less
nimble
than
the
rest
and
is
now
in
my
glove
morrow
i
will
hang
it
my
lord
said
she
this
is
marvellous
but
yet
it
would
be
unseemly
for
a
man
of
dignity
like
thee
to
be
hanging
such
a
reptile
as
this
woe
betide
me
said
he
if
i
would
not
hang
them
all
could
i
catch
them
and
such
as
i
have
i
will
hang
verily
lord
said
she
there
is
no
reason
that
i
should
succor
this
reptile
except
to
prevent
discredit
unto
thee
do
therefore
lord
as
thou
wilt
then
he
went
to
the
mound
of
narberth
taking
the
mouse
with
him
and
he
set
up
two
forks
on
the
highest
part
of
the
mound
and
while
he
was
doing
this
behold
he
saw
a
scholar
coming
towards
him
in
old
and
poor
and
tattered
garments
and
it
was
now
seven
years
since
he
had
seen
in
that
place
either
man
or
beast
except
those
four
persons
who
had
remained
together
until
two
of
them
were
lost
my
lord
said
the
scholar
to
thee
heaven
prosper
thee
and
my
greeting
be
unto
thee
and
whence
dost
thou
come
scholar
asked
he
i
come
lord
from
singing
in
england
and
wherefore
dost
thou
inquire
because
for
the
last
seven
years
answered
he
i
have
seen
no
man
here
save
four
secluded
persons
and
thyself
this
moment
truly
lord
said
he
i
go
through
this
land
unto
mine
own
and
what
work
art
thou
upon
lord
i
am
hanging
a
thief
that
i
caught
robbing
me
said
he
what
manner
of
thief
is
that
asked
the
scholar
i
see
a
creature
in
thy
hand
like
unto
a
mouse
and
ill
does
it
become
a
man
of
rank
equal
to
thine
to
touch
a
reptile
such
as
this
let
it
go
forth
free
i
will
not
let
it
go
free
by
heaven
said
he
i
caught
it
robbing
me
and
the
doom
of
a
thief
will
i
inflict
upon
it
and
i
will
hang
it
lord
said
he
rather
than
see
a
man
of
rank
equal
to
thine
at
such
a
work
as
this
i
would
give
thee
a
pound
which
i
have
received
as
alms
to
let
the
reptile
go
forth
free
i
will
not
let
it
go
free
said
he
neither
will
i
sell
it
as
thou
wilt
lord
he
answered
i
care
naught
and
the
scholar
went
his
way
and
as
he
was
placing
the
upon
the
two
forks
behold
a
priest
came
towards
him
upon
a
horse
covered
with
trappings
good
day
to
thee
lord
said
he
heaven

said
manawyddan
thy
blessing

blessing
of
heaven
be
upon
thee
and
what
lord
art
thou
doing
i
am
hanging
a
thief
that
i
caught
robbing
me
said
he
what
manner
of
thief
lord
asked
he
a
creature
he
answered
in
form
of
a
mouse
it
has
been
robbing
me
and
i
am
inflicting
upon
it
the
doom
of
a
thief
lord
said
he
rather
than
see
thee
touch
this
reptile
i
would
purchase
its
freedom
by
my
confession
to
heaven
neither
will
i
sell
it
nor
set
it
free
it
is
true
lord
that
it
is
worth
nothing
to
buy
but
rather
than
see
thee
defile
thyself
by
touching
such
a
reptile
as
this
i
will
give
thee
three
pounds
to
let
it
go
i
will
not
by
heaven
said
he
take
any
price
for
it
as
it
ought
so
shall
it
be
hanged
and
the
priest
went
his
way
then
he
noosed
the
string
around
the
mouse
neck
and
as
he
was
about
to
draw
it
up
behold
he
saw
a
bishop
retinue
with
his
and
his
attendants
and
the
bishop
himself
came
towards
him
and
he
stayed
his
work
lord
bishop
said
he
thy
blessing
heaven
blessing
be
unto
thee
said
he
what
work
art
thou
upon
hanging
a
thief
that
i
caught
robbing
me
said
he
is
not
that
a
mouse
that
i
see
in
thy
hand
yes
answered
he
and
she
has
robbed
me
ay
said
he
since
i
have
come
at
the
doom
of
this
reptile
i
will
ransom
it
of
thee
i
will
give
thee
seven
pounds
for
it
and
that
rather
than
see
a
man
of
rank
equal
to
thine
destroying
so
vile
a
reptile
as
this
let
it
loose
and
thou
shalt
have
the
money
i
declare
to
heaven
that
i
will
not
let
it
loose
if
thou
wilt
not
loose
it
for
this
i
will
give
thee
four
and
twenty
pounds
of
ready
money
to
set
it
free
i
will
not
set
it
free
by
heaven
for
as
much
again
said
he
if
thou
wilt
not
set
it
free
for
this
i
will
give
thee
all
the
horses
that
thou
seest
in
this
plain
and
the
seven
loads
of
baggage
and
the
seven
horses
that
they
are
upon
by
heaven
i
will
not
he
replied
since
for
this
thou
wilt
not
set
it
free
do
so
at
what
price
soever
thou
wilt
i
will
that
rhiannon
and
pryderi
be
free
said
he
that
thou
shalt
have
he
answered
not
yet
will
i
loose
the
mouse
by
heaven
what
then
wouldst
thou
that
the
charm
and
the
illusion
be
removed
from
the
seven
cantrevs
of
dyved
this
shalt
thou
have
also
set
therefore
the
mouse
free
i
will
not
set
it
free
by
heaven
said
he
till
i
know
who
the
mouse
may
be
she
is
my
wife
wherefore
came
she
to
me
to
despoil
thee
he
answered
i
am
lloyd
the
son
of
kilwed
and
i
cast
the
charm
over
the
seven
cantrevs
of
dyved
and
it
was
to
avenge
gawl
the
son
of
clud
from
the
friendship
i
had
towards
him
that
i
cast
the
charm
and
upon
pryderi
did
i
avenge
gawl
the
son
of
clud
for
the
game
of
badger
in
the
bag
that
pwyll
the
son
of
auwyn
played
upon
him
and
when
it
was
known
that
thou
wast
come
to
dwell
in
the
land
my
household
came
and
besought
me
to
transform
them
into
mice
that
they
might
destroy
thy
corn
and
they
went
the
first
and
the
second
night
and
destroyed
thy
two
crops
and
the
third
night
came
unto
me
my
wife
and
the
ladies
of
the
court
and
besought
me
to
transform
them
and
i
transformed
them
now
she
is
not
in
her
usual
health
and
had
she
been
in
her
usual
health
thou
wouldst
not
have
been
able
to
overtake
her
but
since
this
has
taken
place
and
she
has
been
caught
i
will
restore
to
thee
pryderi
and
rhiannon
and
i
will
take
the
charm
and
illusion
from
off
dyved
set
her
therefore
free
i
will
not
set
her
free
yet
what
wilt
thou
more
he
asked
i
will
that
there
be
no
more
charm
upon
the
seven
cantrevs
of
dyved
and
that
none
shall
be
put
upon
it
henceforth
moreover
that
vengeance
be
never
taken
for
this
either
upon
pryderi
or
rhiannon
or
upon
me
all
this
shalt
thou
have
and
truly
thou
hast
done
wisely
in
asking
this
upon
thy
head
would
have
lit
all
this
trouble
yea
said
he
for
fear
thereof
was
it
that
i
required
this
set
now
my
wife
at
liberty
i
will
not
said
he
until
i
see
pryderi
and
rhiannon
with
me
free
behold
here
they
come
he
answered
and
thereupon
behold
pryderi
and
rhiannon
and
he
rose
up
to
meet
them
and
greeted
them
and
sat
down
beside
them
ah
chieftain
set
now
my
wife
at
liberty
said
the
bishop
hast
thou
not
received
all
thou
didst
ask
i
will
release
her
gladly
said
he
and
thereupon
he
set
her
free
then
he
struck
her
with
a
magic
wand
and
she
was
changed
back
into
a
young
woman
the
fairest
ever
seen
look
round
upon
thy
land
said
he
and
thou
wilt
see
it
all
tilled
and
peopled
as
it
was
in
its
best
estate
and
he
rose
up
and
looked
forth
and
when
he
looked
he
saw
all
the
lands
tilled
and
full
of
herds
and
dwellings
and
thus
ends
this
portion
of
the
mabinogi
the
following
allusions
to
the
preceding
story
are
found
in
a
letter
of
the
poet
southey
to
john
rickman
dated
june
you
will
read
the
mabinogeon
concerning
which
i
ought
to
have
talked
to
you
in
the
last
that
most
odd
and
story
of
the
mouse
mention
is
made
of
a
begging
scholar
that
helps
to
the
date
but
where
did
the
cymri
get
the
imagination
that
could
produce
such
a
tale
that
enchantment
of
the
basin
hanging
by
the
chain
from
heaven
is
in
the
wildest
spirit
of
the
arabian
nights
i
am
perfectly
astonished
that
such
fictions
should
exist
in
welsh
they
throw
no
light
on
the
origin
of
romance
everything
being
utterly
dissimilar
to
what
we
mean
by
that
term
but
they
do
open
a
new
world
of
fiction
and
if
the
date
of
their
language
be
fixed
about
the
twelfth
or
thirteenth
century
i
can
not
but
think
the
mythological
substance
is
of
far
earlier
date
very
probably
brought
from
the
east
by
some
of
the
first
settlers
or
conquerors
chapter
xi
kilwich
and
olwen
kilydd
a
son
of
prince
kelyddon
desired
a
wife
as
a
helpmate
and
the
wife
that
he
chose
was
goleudid
the
daughter
of
prince
anlawd
and
after
their
union
the
people
put
up
prayers
that
they
might
have
an
heir
and
they
had
a
son
through
the
prayers
of
the
people
and
called
his
name
kilwich
after
this
the
boy
mother
goleudid
the
daughter
of
prince
anlawd
fell
sick
then
she
called
her
husband
to
her
and
said
to
him
of
this
sickness
i
shall
die
and
thou
wilt
take
another
wife
now
wives
are
the
gift
of
the
lord
but
it
would
be
wrong
for
thee
to
harm
thy
son
therefore
i
charge
thee
that
thou
take
not
a
wife
until
thou
see
a
briar
with
two
blossoms
upon
my
grave
and
this
he
promised
her
then
she
besought
him
to
dress
her
grave
every
year
that
no
weeds
might
grow
thereon
so
the
queen
died
now
the
king
sent
an
attendant
every
morning
to
see
if
anything
were
growing
upon
the
grave
and
at
the
end
of
the
seventh
year
they
neglected
that
which
they
had
promised
to
the
queen
one
day
the
king
went
to
hunt
and
he
rode
to
the
place
of
burial
to
see
the
grave
and
to
know
if
it
were
time
that
he
should
take
a
wife
and
the
king
saw
the
briar
and
when
he
saw
it
the
king
took
counsel
where
he
should
find
a
wife
said
one
of
his
counsellors
i
know
a
wife
that
will
suit
thee
well
and
she
is
the
wife
of
king
doged
and
they
resolved
to
go
to
seek
her
and
they
slew
the
king
and
brought
away
his
wife
and
they
conquered
the
kings
lands
and
he
married
the
widow
of
king
doged
the
sister
of
yspadaden
penkawr
and
one
day
his
stepmother
said
to
kilwich
it
were
well
for
thee
to
have
a
wife
i
am
not
yet
of
an
age
to
wed
answered
the
youth
then
said
she
unto
him
i
declare
to
thee
that
it
is
thy
destiny
not
to
be
suited
with
a
wife
until
thou
obtain
olwen
the
daughter
of
yspadaden
penkawr
and
the
youth
blushed
and
the
love
of
the
maiden
diffused
itself
through
all
his
frame
although
he
had
never
seen
her
and
his
father
inquired
of
him
what
has
come
over
thee
my
son
and
what
aileth
thee
my
stepmother
has
declared
to
me
that
i
shall
never
have
a
wife
until
i
obtain
olwen
the
daughter
of
yspadaden
penkawr
that
will
be
easy
for
thee
answered
his
father
arthur
is
thy
cousin
go
therefore
unto
arthur
to
cut
thy
hair
and
ask
this
of
him
as
a
boon
and
the
youth
pricked
forth
upon
a
steed
with
head
dappled
gray
four
winters
old
firm
of
limb
with
hoofs
having
a
bridle
of
linked
gold
on
his
head
and
upon
him
a
saddle
of
costly
gold
and
in
the
youth
hand
were
two
spears
of
silver
sharp
headed
with
steel
three
ells
in
length
of
an
edge
to
wound
the
wind
and
cause
blood
to
flow
and
swifter
than
the
fall
of
the
from
the
blade
of
when
the
dew
of
june
is
at
the
heaviest
a
sword
was
upon
his
thigh
the
blade
of
which
was
gilded
bearing
a
cross
of
inlaid
gold
of
the
hue
of
the
lightning
of
heaven
his
was
of
ivory
before
him
were
two
brindled
greyhounds
having
strong
collars
of
rubies
about
their
necks
reaching
from
the
shoulder
to
the
ear
and
the
one
that
was
upon
the
left
side
bounded
across
to
the
right
side
and
the
one
on
the
right
to
the
left
and
like
two
sported
around
him
and
his
courser
cast
up
four
sods
with
his
four
hoofs
like
four
swallows
in
the
air
about
his
head
now
above
now
below
about
him
was
a
cloth
of
purple
and
an
apple
of
gold
was
at
each
corner
and
every
one
of
the
apples
was
of
the
value
of
an
hundred
kine
and
there
was
precious
gold
of
the
value
of
three
hundred
kine
upon
his
shoes
and
upon
his
stirrups
from
his
knee
to
the
tip
of
his
toe
and
the
blade
of
grass
bent
not
beneath
him
so
light
was
his
courser
tread
as
he
journeyed
toward
the
gate
of
arthur
palace
spoke
the
youth

horn
and
there
is
revelry
in
arthur
hall
and
none

enter
therein
but
the
son
of
a
king
of
a
privileged
country
or
a
craftsman
bringing
his
craft
but
there

refreshment
for
thy
dogs
and
for
thy
horse
and
for
thee
there

into

precincts
of
the
palace
of
arthur
thou
wilt
fare
no
worse
there
than
thou
wouldst
with
arthur
in
the
court
a
lady
shall
smooth
thy
couch
and
shall
lull
thee
with
songs
and
early
morning
when
the
gate
is
open
for
the
multitude
that
came
hither
for
thee
shall
it
be
opened
first
and
thou
mayest
sit
in
the
place
that
thou
shalt
choose
in
arthur
hall
from
the
upper
end
to
the
lower
said
the
youth
that
will
i
not
do
if
thou
openest
the
gate
it
is
well
if
thou
dost
not
open
it
i
will
bring
disgrace
upon
thy
lord
and
evil
report
upon
thee
and
i
will
set
up
three
shouts
at
this
very
gate
than
which
none
were
ever
heard
more
deadly
what
clamor
soever
thou
mayest
make
said
glewlwyd
the
porter
against
the
laws
of
arthur
palace
shalt
thou
not
enter
therein
until
i
first
go
and
speak
with
arthur
then
glewlwyd
went
into
the
hall
and
arthur
said
to
him
hast
thou
news
from
the
gate
half
of
my
life
is
passed
said
glewlwyd
and
half
of
thine
i
was
heretofore
in
kaer
se
and
asse
in
sach
and
salach
in
lotor
and
fotor
and
i
have
been
in
india
the
great
and
india
the
lesser
and
i
have
also
been
in
europe
and
africa
and
in
the
islands
of
corsica
and
i
was
present
when
thou
didst
conquer
greece
in
the
east
nine
supreme
sovereigns
handsome
men
saw
we
there
but
never
did
i
behold
a
man
of
equal
dignity
with
him
who
is
now
at
the
door
of
the
portal
then
said
arthur
if
walking
thou
didst
enter
here
return
thou
running
it
is
unbecoming
to
keep
such
a
man
as
thou
sayest
he
is
in
the
wind
and
the
rain
said
kay
by
the
hand
of
my
friend
if
thou
wouldst
follow
my
counsel
thou
wouldst
not
break
through
the
laws
of
the
court
because
of
him
not
so
blessed
kay
said
arthur
it
is
an
honor
to
us
to
be
resorted
to
and
the
greater
our
courtesy
the
greater
will
be
our
renown
and
our
fame
and
our
glory
and
glewlwyd
came
to
the
gate
and
opened
the
gate
before
kilwich
and
although
all
dismounted
upon
the
at
the
gate
yet
did
he
not
dismount
but
he
rode
in
upon
his
charger
then
said
he
greeting
be
unto
thee
sovereign
ruler
of
this
island
and
be
this
greeting
no
less
unto
the
lowest
than
unto
the
highest
and
be
it
equally
unto
thy
guests
and
thy
warriors
and
thy
chieftains
let
all
partake
of
it
as
completely
as
thyself
and
complete
be
thy
favor
and
thy
fame
and
thy
glory
throughout
all
this
island
greeting
unto
thee
also
said
arthur
sit
thou
between
two
of
my
warriors
and
thou
shalt
have
minstrels
before
thee
and
thou
shalt
enjoy
the
privileges
of
a
king
born
to
a
throne
as
long
as
thou
remainest
here
and
when
i
disperse
my
presents
to
the
visitors
and
strangers
in
this
court
they
shall
be
in
thy
hand
at
my
commencing
said
the
youth
i
came
not
here
to
consume
meat
and
drink
but
if
i
obtain
the
boon
that
i
seek
i
will
requite
it
thee
and
extol
thee
but
if
i
have
it
not
i
will
bear
forth
thy
dispraise
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
as
far
as
thy
renown
has
extended
then
said
arthur
since
thou
wilt
not
remain
here
chieftain
thou
shalt
receive
the
boon
whatsoever
thy
tongue
may
name
as
far
as
the
wind
dries
and
the
rain
moistens
and
the
sun
revolves
and
the
sea
encircles
and
the
earth
extends
save
only
my
ship
prydwen
and
my
mantle
and
caliburn
my
sword
and
rhongomyant
my
lance
and
guenever
my
wife
by
the
truth
of
heaven
thou
shalt
have
it
cheerfuly
name
what
thou
wilt
i
would
that
thou
bless
my
hair
said
he
that
shall
be
granted
thee
and
arthur
took
a
golden
comb
and
scissors
whereof

footnote
the
welsh
have
a
fable
on
the
subject
of
the
half
man
taken
to
be
illustrative
of
the
force
of
habit
in
this
allegory
arthur
is
supposed
to
be
met
by
a
sprite
who
appears
at
first
in
a
small
and
indistinct
form
but
who
on
approaching
nearer
increases
in
size
and
assuming
the
semblance
of
half
a
man
endeavors
to
provoke
the
king
to
wrestle
despising
his
weakness
and
considering
that
he
should
gain
no
credit
by
the
encounter
arthur
refuses
to
do
so
and
delays
the
contest
until
at
length
the
half
man
habit
becomes
so
strong
that
it
requires
his
utmost
efforts
to
overcome
him
the
all
these
did
kilwich
the
son
of
kilydd
adjure
to
obtain
his
boon
then
said
arthur
o
chieftain
i
have
never
heard
of
the
maiden
of
whom
thou
speakest
nor
of
her
kindred
but
i
will
gladly
send
messengers
in
search
of
her
give
me
time
to
seek
her
and
the
youth
said
i
will
willingly
grant
from
this
night
to
that
at
the
end
of
the
year
to
do
so
then
arthur
sent
messengers
to
every
land
within
his
dominions
to
seek
for
the
maiden
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
arthur
messengers
returned
without
having
gained
any
knowledge
or
intelligence
concerning
olwen
more
than
on
the
first
day
then
said
kilwich
every
one
has
received
his
boon
and
i
yet
lack
mine
i
will
depart
and
bear
away
thy
honor
with
me
then
said
kay
rash
chieftain
dost
thou
reproach
arthur
go
with
us
and
we
will
not
part
until
thou
dost
either
confess
that
the
maiden
exists
not
in
the
world
or
until
we
obtain
her
thereupon
kay
rose
up
and
arthur
called
bedwyr
who
never
shrank
from
any
enterprise
upon
which
kay
was
bound
none
were
equal
to
him
in
swiftness
throughout
this
island
except
arthur
alone
and
although
he
was
one
handed
three
warriors
could
not
shed
blood
faster
than
he
on
the
field
of
battle
and
arthur
called
to
kyndelig
the
guide
go
thou
upon
this
expedition
with
the
chieftain
for
as
good
a
guide
was
he
in
a
land
which
he
had
never
seen
as
he
was
in
his
own
he
called
gurhyr
gwalstat
because
he
knew
all
tongues
he
called
gawain
the
son
of
gwyar
because
he
never
returned
home
without
achieving
the
adventure
of
which
he
went
in
quest
and
arthur
called
meneu
the
son
of
teirgwed
in
order
that
if
they
went
into
a
savage
country
he
might
cast
a
charm
and
an
illusion
over
them
so
that
none
might
see
them
whilst
they
could
see
every
one
they
journeyed
until
they
came
to
a
vast
open
plain
wherein
they
saw
a
great
castle
which
was
the
fairest
of
the
castles
of
the
world
and
when
they
came
before
the
castle
they
beheld
a
vast
flock
of
sheep
and
upon
the
top
of
a
mound
there
was
a
herdsman
keeping
the
sheep
and
a
rug
made
of
skins
was
upon
him
and
by
his
side
was
a
shaggy
mastiff
larger
than
a
steed
nine
winters
old
then
said
kay
gurhyr
gwalstat
go
thou
and
salute
yonder
man
kay
said
he
i
engaged
not
to
go
further
than
thou
thyself
let
us
go
then
together
answered
kay
said
meneu
fear
not
to
go
thither
for
i
will
cast
a
spell
upon
the
dog
so
that
he
shall
injure
no
one
and
they
went
up
to
the
mound
whereon
the
herdsman
was
and
they
said
to
him
how
dost
thou
fare
herdsman
not
less
fair
be
it
to
you
than
to
me
whose
are
the
sheep
that
thou
dost
keep
and
to
whom
does
yonder
castle
belong
stupid
are
ye
truly
not
to
know
that
this
is
the
castle
of
yspadaden
penkawr
and
ye
also
who
are
ye
we
are
an
embassy
from
arthur
come
to
seek
olwen
the
daughter
of
yspadaden
penkawr
o
men
the
mercy
of
heaven
be
upon
you
do
not
that
for
all
the
world
none
who
ever
came
hither
on
this
quest
has
returned
alive
and
the
herdsman
rose
up
and
as
he
rose
kilwich
gave
unto
him
a
ring
of
gold
and
he
went
home
and
gave
the
ring
to
his
spouse
to
keep
and
she
took
the
ring
when
it
was
given
her
and
she
said
whence
came
this
ring
for
thou
art
not
wont
to
have
good
fortune
o
wife
him
to
whom
this
ring
belonged
thou
shalt
see
here
this
evening
and
who
is
he
asked
the
woman
kilwich
the
son
of
kilydd
by
goleudid
the
daughter
of
prince
anlawd
who
is
come
to
seek
olwen
as
his
wife
and
when
she
heard
that
she
had
joy
that
her
nephew
the
son
of
her
sister
was
coming
to
her
and
sorrow
because
she
had
never
known
any
one
depart
alive
who
had
come
on
that
quest
and
the
men
went
forward
to
the
gate
of
the
herdsman
dwelling
and
when
she
heard
their
footsteps
approaching
she
ran
out
with
joy
to
meet
them
and
kay
snatched
a
billet
out
of
the
pile
and
when
she
met
them
she
sought
to
throw
her
arms
about
their
necks
and
kay
placed
the
log
between
her
two
hands
and
she
squeezed
it
so
that
it
became
a
twisted
coil
o
woman
said
kay
if
thou
hadst
squeezed
me
thus
none
could
ever
again
have
set
their
affections
on
me
evil
love
were
this
they
entered
into
the
house
and
were
served
and
soon
after
they
all
went
forth
to
amuse
themselves
then
the
woman
opened
a
stone
chest
that
was
before
the
and
out
of
it
arose
a
youth
with
yellow
curling
hair
said
gurhyr
it
is
a
pity
to
hide
this
youth
i
know
that
it
is
not
his
own
crime
that
is
thus
visited
upon
him
this
is
but
a
remnant
said
the
woman
three
and
twenty
of
my
sons
has
yspadaden
penkawr
slain
and
i
have
no
more
hope
of
this
one
than
of
the
others
then
said
kay
let
him
come
and
be
a
companion
with
me
and
he
shall
not
be
slain
unless
i
also
am
slain
with
him
and
they
ate
and
the
woman
asked
them
upon
what
errand
come
you
here
we
come
to
seek
olwen
for
this
youth
then
said
the
woman
in
the
name
of
heaven
since
no
one
from
the
castle
hath
yet
seen
you
return
again
whence
you
came
heaven
is
our
witness
that
we
will
not
return
until
we
have
seen
the
maiden
does
she
ever
come
hither
so
that
she
may
be
seen
she
comes
here
every
saturday
to
wash
her
head
and
in
the
vessel
where
she
washes
she
leaves
all
her
rings
and
she
never
either
comes
herself
or
sends
any
messengers
to
fetch
them
will
she
come
here
if
she
is
sent
to
heaven
knows
that
i
will
not
destroy
my
soul
nor
will
i
betray
those
that
trust
me
unless
you
will
pledge
me
your
faith
that
you
will
not
harm
her
i
will
not
send
to
her
we
pledge
it
said
they
so
a
message
was
sent
and
she
came
the
maiden
was
clothed
in
a
robe
of
silk
and
about
her
neck
was
a
collar
of
ruddy
gold
on
which
were
precious
emeralds
and
rubies
more
yellow
was
her
head
than
the
flower
of
the
broom
footnote
the
romancers
dwell
with
great
complacency
on
the
fair
hair
and
delicate
complexion
of
their
heroines
this
taste
continued
for
a
long
time
and
to
render
the
hair
light
was
an
object
of
education
even
when
wigs
came
into
fashion
they
were
all
flaxen
such
was
the
color
of
the
hair
of
the
gauls
and
of
their
german
conquerors
it
required
some
centuries
to
reconcile
their
eyes
to
the
swarthy
beauties
of
their
spanish
and
italian
neighbors
and
her
skin
was
whiter
than
the
foam
of
the
wave
and
fairer
were
her
hands
and
her
fingers
than
the
blossoms
of
the
amidst
the
spray
of
the
meadow

the
eye
of
the
trained
hawk
was
not
brighter
than
hers
her
bosom
was
more
snowy
than
the
breast
of
the
white
swan
her
cheek
was
redder
than
the
reddest
roses
whoso
beheld
her
was
filled
with
her
love
four
white
trefoils
sprung
up
wherever
she
trod
and
therefore
was
she
called
olwen
she
entered
the
house
and
sat
beside
kilwich
upon
the
foremost
bench
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
he
knew
her
and
kilwich
said
unto
her
ah
maiden
thou
art
she
whom
i
have
loved
come
away
with
me
lest
they
speak
evil
of
thee
and
of
me
many
a
day
have
i
loved
thee
i
can
not
do
this
for
i
have
pledged
my
faith
to
my
father
not
to
go
without
his
counsel
for
his
life
will
last
only
until
the
time
of
my
espousals
whatever
is
to
be
must
be
but
i
will
give
thee
advice
if
thou
wilt
take
it
go
ask
me
of
my
father
and
that
which
he
shall
require
of
thee
grant
it
and
thou
wilt
obtain
me
but
if
thou
deny
him
anything
thou
wilt
not
obtain
me
and
it
will
be
well
for
thee
if
thou
escape
with
thy
life
i
promise
all
this
if
occasion
offer
said
he
she
returned
to
her
chamber
and
they
all
rose
up
and
followed
her
to
the
castle
and
they
slew
the
nine
porters
that
were
at
the
nine
gates
in
silence
and
they
slew
the
nine
without
one
of
them
barking
and
they
went
forward
to
the
hall
the
greeting
of
heaven
and
of
man
be
unto
thee
yspadaden
penkawr
said
they
and
you
wherefore
come
you
we
come
to
ask
thy
daughter
olwen
for
kilwich
the
son
of
kilydd
the
son
of
prince
kelyddon
where
are
my
pages
and
my
servants
raise
up
the
forks
beneath
my
two
eyebrows
which
have
fallen
over
my
eyes
that
i
may
see
the
fashion
of
my
and
they
did
so
come
hither
and
you
shall
have
an
answer
they
rose
to
go
forth
and
yspadaden
penkawr
seized
one
of
the
three
poisoned
darts
that
lay
beside
him
and
threw
it
after
them
and
bedwyr
caught
it
and
flung
it
and
pierced
yspadaden
penkawr
grievously
with
it
through
the
knee
then
he
said
a
cursed
ungentle
truly
i
shall
ever
walk
the
worse
for
his
rudeness
and
shall
ever
be
without
a
cure
this
poisoned
iron
pains
me
like
the
bite
of
a
cursed
be
the
smith
who
forged
it
and
the
anvil
on
which
it
was
wrought
so
sharp
is
it
that
night
also
they
took
up
their
abode
in
the
house
of
the
herdsman
the
next
day
with
the
dawn
they
arrayed
themselves
and
proceeded
to
the
castle
and
entered
the
hall
and
they
said
yspadaden
penkawr
give
us
thy
daughter
in
consideration
of
her
dower
and
her
maiden
fee
which
we
will
pay
to
thee
and
to
her
two
kinswomen
likewise
then
he
said
her
four
grandmothers
and
her
four
are
yet
alive
it
is
needful
that
i
take
counsel
of
them
be
it
so
they
answered
we
will
go
to
meat
as
they
rose
up
he
took
the
second
dart
that
was
beside
him
and
cast
it
after
them
and
meneu
the
son
of
gawedd
caught
it
and
flung
it
back
at
him
and
wounded
him
in
the
centre
of
the
breast
a
cursed
ungentle
truly
said
he
the
hard
iron
pains
me
like
the
bite
of
a
cursed
be
the
hearth
whereon
it
was
heated
and
the
smith
who
formed
it
so
sharp
is
it
henceforth
whenever
i
go
up
hill
i
shall
have
a
scant
in
my
breath
and
a
pain
in
my
chest
and
i
shall
often
loathe
my
food
and
they
went
to
meat
and
the
third
day
they
returned
to
the
palace
and
yspadaden
penkawr
said
to
them
shoot
not
at
me
again
unless
you
desire
death
where
are
my
attendants
lift
up
the
forks
of
my
eyebrows
which
have
fallen
over
my
eyeballs
that
i
may
see
the
fashion
of
my
then
they
arose
and
as
they
did
so
yspadaden
penkawr
took
the
third
poisoned
dart
and
cast
it
at
them
and
kilwich
caught
it
and
threw
it
vigorously
and
wounded
him
through
the
eyeball
a
cursed
ungentle
truly
as
long
as
i
remain
alive
my
eyesight
will
be
the
worse
whenever
i
go
against
the
wind
my
eyes
will
water
and
peradventure
my
head
will
burn
and
i
shall
have
a
giddiness
every
new
moon
like
the
bite
of
a
mad
dog
is
the
stroke
of
this
poisoned
iron
cursed
be
the
fire
in
which
it
was
forged
and
they
went
to
meat
and
the
next
day
they
came
again
to
the
palace
and
they
said
shoot
not
at
us
any
more
unless
thou
desirest
such
hurt
and
harm
and
torture
as
thou
now
hast
and
even
more
said
kilwich
give
me
thy
daughter
and
if
thou
wilt
not
give
her
thou
shalt
receive
thy
death
because
of
her
where
is
he
that
seeks
my
daughter
come
hither
where
i
may
see
thee
and
they
placed
him
a
chair
face
to
face
with
him
said
yspadaden
penkawr
is
it
thou
that
seekest
my
daughter
it
is
i
answered
kilwich
i
must
have
thy
pledge
that
thou
wilt
not
do
toward
me
otherwise
than
is
just
and
when
i
have
gotten
that
which
i
shall
name
my
daughter
thou
shalt
have
i
promise
thee
that
willingly
said
kilwich
name
what
thou
wilt
i
will
do
so
said
he
seest
thou
yonder
red
tilled
ground
i
see
it
when
first
i
met
the
mother
of
this
maiden
nine
bushels
of
flax
were
sown
therein
and
none
has
yet
sprung
up
white
nor
black
i
require
to
have
the
flax
to
sow
in
the
new
land
yonder

chapter
xii
kilwich
and
olwen
continued
all
that
day
they
journeyed
until
the
evening
and
then
they
beheld
a
vast
castle
which
was
the
largest
in
the
world
and
lo
a
black
man
larger
than
three
of
the
men
of
this
world
came
out
from
the
castle
and
they
spoke
unto
him
and
said
o
man
whose
castle
is
that
stupid
are
ye
truly
o
men
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
that
does
not
know
that
this
is
the
castle
of
gwernach
the
giant
what
treatment
is
there
for
guests
and
strangers
that
alight
in
that
castle
o
chieftain
heaven
protect
thee
no
guests
ever
returned
thence
alive
and
no
one
may
enter
therein
unless
he
brings
with
him
his
craft
then
they
proceeded
towards
the
gate
said
gurhyr
gwalstat
is
there
a
porter
there
is
wherefore
dost
thou
call
open
the
gate
i
will
not
open
it
wherefore
wilt
thou
not
the
knife
is
in
the
meat
and
the
drink
is
in
the
horn
and
there
is
revelry
in
the
hall
of
gwernach
the
giant
and
except
for
a
craftsman
who
brings
his
craft
the
gate
will
not
be
opened
verily
porter
then
said
kay
my
craft
bring
i
with
me
what
is
thy
craft
the
best
burnisher
of
swords
am
i
in
the
world
i
will
go
and
tell
this
unto
gwernach
the
giant
and
i
will
bring
thee
an
answer
so
the
porter
went
in
and
gwernach
said
to
him
hast
thou
news
from
the
gate
i
have
there
is
a
party
at
the
door
of
the
gate
who
desire
to
come
in
didst
thou
inquire
of
them
if
they
possessed
any
art
i
did
inquire
said
he
and
one
told
me
that
he
was
well
skilled
in
the
burnishing
of
swords
we
have
need
of
him
then
for
some
time
have
i
sought
for
some
one
to
polish
my
sword
and
could
find
no
one
let
this
man
enter
since
he
brings
with
him
his
craft
the
porter
thereupon
returned
and
opened
the
gate
and
kay
went
in
by
himself
and
he
saluted
gwernach
the
giant
and
a
chair
was
placed
for
him
opposite
to
gwernach
and
gwernach
said
to
him
o
man
is
it
true
that
is
reported
of
thee
that
thou
knowest
how
to
burnish
swords
i
know
full
well
how
to
do
so
answered
kay
then
was
the
sword
of
gwernach
brought
to
him
and
kay
took
a
blue
whetstone
from
under
his
arm
and
asked
whether
he
would
have
it
burnished
white
or
blue
do
with
it
as
it
seems
good
to
thee
or
as
thou
wouldst
if
it
were
thine
own
then
kay
polished
one
half
of
the
blade
and
put
it
in
his
hand
will
this
please
thee
asked
he
i
would
rather
than
all
that
is
in
my
dominions
that
the
whole
of
it
were
like
this
it
is
a
marvel
to
me
that
such
a
man
as
thou
should
be
without
a
companion
o
noble
sir
i
have
a
companion
albeit
he
is
not
skilled
in
this
art
who
may
he
be
let
the
porter
go
forth
and
i
will
tell
him
whereby
he
may
know
him
the
head
of
his
lance
will
leave
its
shaft
and
draw
blood
from
the
wind
and
will
descend
upon
its
shaft
again
then
the
gate
was
opened
and
bedwyr
entered
and
kay
said
bedwyr
is
very
skilful
though
he
knows
not
this
art
and
there
was
much
discourse
among
those
who
were
without
because
that
kay
and
bedwyr
had
gone
in
and
a
young
man
who
was
with
them
the
only
son
of
the
herdsman
got
in
also
and
he
contrived
to
admit
all
the
rest
but
they
kept
themselves
concealed
the
sword
was
now
polished
and
kay
gave
it
unto
the
hand
of
gwernach
the
giant
to
see
if
he
were
pleased
with
his
work
and
the
giant
said
the
work
is
good
i
am
content
therewith
said
kay
it
is
thy
scabbard
that
hath
rusted
thy
sword
give
it
to
me
that
i
may
take
out
the
wooden
sides
of
it
and
put
in
new
ones
and
he
took
the
scabbard
from
him
and
the
sword
in
the
other
hand
and
he
came
and
stood
over
against
the
giant
as
if
he
would
have
put
the
sword
into
the
scabbard
and
with
it
he
struck
at
the
head
of
the
giant
and
cut
off
his
head
at
one
blow
then
they
despoiled
the
castle
and
took
from
it
what
goods
and
jewels
they
would
and
they
returned
to
arthur
court
bearing
with
them
the
sword
of
gwernach
the
giant
and
when
they
told
arthur
how
they
had
sped
arthur
said
it
is
a
good
beginning
then
they
took
counsel
and
said
which
of
these
marvels
will
it
be
best
for
us
to
seek
next
it
will
be
best
said
one
to
seek
mabon
the
son
of
modron
and
he
will
not
be
found
unless
we
first
find
eidoel
the
son
of
aer
his
kinsman
then
arthur
rose
up
and
the
warriors
of
the
island
of
britain
with
him
to
seek
for
eidoel
and
they
proceeded
until
they
came
to
the
castle
of
glivi
where
eidoel
was
imprisoned
glivi
stood
on
the
summit
of
his
castle
and
he
said
arthur
what
requirest
thou
of
me
since
nothing
remains
to
me
in
this
fortress
and
i
have
neither
joy
nor
pleasure
in
it
neither
wheat
nor
oats
seek
not
therefore
to
do
me
harm
said
arthur
not
to
injure
thee
came
i
hither
but
to
seek
for
the
prisoner
that
is
with
thee
i
will
give
thee
my
prisoner
though
i
had
not
thought
to
give
him
up
to
any
one
and
therewith
shalt
thou
have
my
support
and
my
aid
his
followers
said
unto
arthur
lord
go
thou
home
thou
canst
not
proceed
with
thy
host
in
quest
of
such
small
adventures
as
these
then
said
arthur
it
were
well
for
thee
gurhyr
gwalstat
to
go
upon
this
quest
for
thou
knowest
all
languages
and
art
familiar
with
those
of
the
birds
and
the
beasts
thou
eidoel
oughtest
likewise
to
go
with
thy
men
in
search
of
thy
cousin
and
as
for
you
kay
and
bedwyr
i
have
hope
of
whatever
adventure
ye
are
in
quest
of
that
ye
will
achieve
it
achieve
ye
this
adventure
for
me
they
went
forward
until
they
came
to
the
ousel
of
cilgwri
and
gurhyr
adjured
her
saying
tell
me
if
thou
knowest
aught
of
mabon
the
son
of
modron
who
was
taken
when
three
nights
old
from
between
his
mother
and
the
wall
and
the
ousel
answered
when
i
first
came
here
there
was
a
smith
anvil
in
this
place
and
i
was
then
a
young
bird
and
from
that
time
no
work
has
been
done
upon
it
save
the
pecking
of
my
beak
every
evening
and
now
there
is
not
so
much
as
the
size
of
a
nut
remaining
thereof
yet
during
all
that
time
i
have
never
heard
of
the
man
for
whom
you
inquire
nevertheless
i
will
do
that
which
it
is
fitting
that
i
should
for
an
embassy
from
arthur
there
is
a
race
of
animals
who
were
formed
before
me
and
i
will
be
your
guide
to
them
so
they
proceeded
to
the
place
where
was
the
stag
of
redynvre
stag
of
redynvre
behold
we
are
come
to
thee
an
embassy
from
arthur
for
we
have
not
heard
of
any
animal
older
than
thou
say
knowest
thou
aught
of
mabon
the
son
of
modron
who
was
taken
from
his
mother
when
three
nights
old
the
stag
said
when
first
i
came
hither
there
was
a
plain
all
around
me
without
any
trees
save
one
oak
sapling
which
grew
up
to
be
an
oak
with
an
hundred
branches
and
that
oak
has
since
perished
so
that
now
nothing
remains
of
it
but
the
withered
stump
and
from
that
day
to
this
i
have
been
here
yet
have
i
never
heard
of
the
man
for
whom
you
inquire
nevertheless
being
an
embassy
from
arthur
i
will
be
your
guide
to
the
place
where
there
is
an
animal
which
was
formed
before
i
was
and
the
oldest
animal
in
the
world
and
the
one
that
has
travelled
most
the
eagle
of
gwern
abwy
gurhyr
said
eagle
of
gwern
abwy
we
have
come
to
thee
an
embassy
from
arthur
to
ask
thee
if
thou
knowest
aught
of
mabon
the
son
of
modron
who
was
taken
from
his
mother
when
he
was
three
nights
old
the
eagle
said
i
have
been
here
for
a
great
space
of
time
and
when
i
first
came
hither
there
was
a
rock
here
from
the
top
of
which
i
pecked
at
the
stars
every
evening
and
it
has
crumbled
away
and
now
it
is
not
so
much
as
a
span
high
all
that
time
i
have
been
here
and
i
have
never
heard
of
the
man
for
whom
you
inquire
except
once
when
i
went
in
search
of
food
as
far
as
llyn
llyw
and
when
i
came
there
i
struck
my
talons
into
a
salmon
thinking
he
would
serve
me
as
food
for
a
long
time
but
he
drew
me
into
the
water
and
i
was
scarcely
able
to
escape
from
him
after
that
i
made
peace
with
him
and
i
drew
fifty
spears
out
of
his
back
and
relieved
him
unless
he
know
something
of
him
whom
you
seek
i
can
not
tell
who
may
however
i
will
guide
you
to
the
place
where
he
is
so
they
went
thither
and
the
eagle
said
salmon
of
llyn
llyw
i
have
come
to
thee
with
an
embassy
from
arthur
to
ask
thee
if
thou
knowest
aught
of
mabon
the
son
of
modron
who
was
taken
away
at
three
nights
old
from
his
mother
as
much
as
i
know
i
will
tell
thee
with
every
tide
i
go
along
the
river
upward
until
i
come
near
to
the
walls
of
gloucester
and
there
have
i
found
such
wrong
as
i
never
found
elsewhere
and
to
the
end
that
ye
may
give
credence
thereto
let
one
of
you
go
thither
upon
each
of
my
two
shoulders
so
kay
and
gurhyr
gwalstat
went
upon
the
two
shoulders
of
the
salmon
and
they
proceeded
until
they
came
unto
the
wall
of
the
prison
and
they
heard
a
great
wailing
and
lamenting
from
the
dungeon
said
gurhyr
who
is
it
that
laments
in
this
house
of
stone
alas
it
is
mabon
the
son
of
modron
who
is
here
imprisoned
and
no
imprisonment
was
ever
so
grievous
as
mine
hast
thou
hope
of
being
released
for
gold
or
for
silver
or
for
any
gifts
of
wealth
or
through
battle
and
fighting
by
fighting
will
what
ever
i
may
gain
be
obtained
then
they
went
thence
and
returned
to
arthur
and
they
told
him
where
mabon
the
son
of
modron
was
imprisoned
and
arthur
summoned
the
warriors
of
the
island
and
they
journeyed
as
far
as
gloucester
to
the
place
where
mabon
was
in
prison
kay
and
bedwyr
went
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
fish
whilst
the
warriors
of
arthur
attacked
the
castle
and
kay
broke
through
the
wall
into
the
dungeon
and
brought
away
the
prisoner
upon
his
back
whilst
the
fight
was
going
on
between
the
warriors
and
arthur
returned
home
and
mabon
with
him
at
liberty
on
a
certain
day
as
gurhyr
gwalstat
was
walking
over
a
mountain
he
heard
a
wailing
and
a
grievous
cry
and
when
he
heard
it
he
sprang
forward
and
went
towards
it
and
when
he
came
there
he
saw
a
fire
burning
among
the
turf
and
an
nearly
surrounded
with
the
fire
and
he
drew
his
sword
and
smote
off
the
close
to
the
earth
so
that
it
escaped
being
burned
in
the
fire
and
the
ants
said
to
him
receive
from
us
the
blessing
of
heaven
and
that
which
no
man
can
give
we
give
thee
then
they
fetched
the
nine
bushels
of
which
yspadaden
penkawr
had
required
of
kilwich
and
they
brought
the
full
measure
without
lacking
any
except
one
and
that
the
lame
pismire
brought
in
before
night
then
said
arthur
which
of
the
marvels
will
it
be
best
for
us
to
seek
next
it
will
be
best
to
seek
for
the
two
cubs
of
the
wolf
gast
rhymhi
is
it
known
said
arthur
where
she
is
she
is
in
aber
cleddyf
said
one
then
arthur
went
to
the
house
of
tringad
in
aber
cleddyf
and
he
inquired
of
him
whether
he
had
heard
of
her
there
she
has
often
slain
my
herds
and
she
is
there
below
in
a
cave
in
aber
cleddyf
ther
arthur
went
in
his
ship
prydwen
by
sea
and
the
others
went
by
land
to
hunt
her
and
they
surrounded
her
and
her
two
cubs
and
took
them
and
carried
them
away
as
kay
and
bedwyr
sat
on
a
on
the
summit
of
plinlimmon
in
the
highest
wind
that
ever
was
they
looked
around
them
and
saw
a
great
smoke
afar
off
then
said
kay
by
the
hand
of
my
friend
yonder
is
the
fire
of
a
robber
then
they
hastened
towards
the
smoke
and
they
came
so
near
to
it
that
they
could
see
dillus
varwawc
scorching
a
wild
boar
behold
yonder
is
the
greatest
robber
that
ever
fled
from
arthur
said
bedwyr
to
kay
dost
thou
know
him
i
do
know
him
answered
kay
he
is
dillus
varwarc
and
no
leash
in
the
world
will
be
able
to
hold
the
cubs
of
gast
rhymi
save
a
leash
made
from
the
beard
of
him
thou
seest
yonder
and
even
that
will
be
useless
unless
his
beard
be
plucked
out
alive
with
wooden
tweezers
for
if
dead
it
will
be
brittle
what
thinkest
thou
that
we
should
do
concerning
this
said
bedwyr
let
us
suffer
him
said
kay
to
eat
as
much
as
he
will
of
the
meat
and
after
that
he
will
fall
asleep
and
during
that
time
they
employed
themselves
in
making
the
wooden
tweezers
and
when
kay
knew
certainly
that
he
was
asleep
he
made
a
pit
under
his
feet
and
he
struck
him
a
violent
blow
and
squeezed
him
into
the
pit
and
there
they
twitched
out
his
beard
completely
with
the
wooden
tweezers
and
after
that
they
slew
him
altogether
and
from
thence
they
went
and
took
the
leash
made
of
dillus
beard
and
they
gave
it
into
arthur
hand
thus
they
got
all
the
marvels
that
yspadaden
penkawr
had
required
of
kilwich
and
they
set
forward
and
took
the
marvels
to
his
court
and
kilwich
said
to
yspadaden
penkawr
is
thy
daughter
mine
now
she
is
thine
said
he
but
therefore
needest
thou
not
thank
me
but
arthur
who
hath
accomplished
this
for
thee
then
goreu
the
son
of
custennin
the
herdsman
whose
brothers
yspadaden
penkawr
had
slain
seized
him
by
the
hair
of
his
head
and
dragged
him
after
him
to
the
keep
and
cut
off
his
head
and
placed
it
on
a
stake
on
the
citadel
then
they
took
possession
of
his
castle
and
of
his
treasures
and
that
night
olwen
became
kilwich
bride
and
she
continued
to
be
his
wife
as
long
as
she
lived
chapter
xiii
taliesin
gwyddno
garanhir
was
sovereign
of
gwaelod
a
territory
bordering
on
the
sea
and
he
possessed
a
weir
upon
the
strand
between
dyvi
and
aberystwyth
near
to
his
own
castle
and
the
value
of
an
hundred
pounds
was
taken
in
that
weir
every
may
eve
and
gwyddno
had
an
only
son
named
elphin
the
most
hapless
of
youths
and
the
most
needy
and
it
grieved
his
father
sore
for
he
thought
that
he
was
born
in
an
evil
hour
by
the
advice
of
his
council
his
father
had
granted
him
the
drawing
of
the
weir
that
year
to
see
if
good
luck
would
ever
befall
him
and
to
give
him
something
wherewith
to
begin
the
world
and
this
was
on
the
of
april
the
next
day
when
elphin
went
to
look
there
was
nothing
in
the
weir
but
a
leathern
bag
upon
a
pole
of
the
weir
then
said
the
unto
elphin
all
thy
aforetime
was
nothing
to
this
and
now
thou
hast
destroyed
the
virtues
of
the
weir
which
always
yielded
the
value
of
an
hundred
pounds
every
may
eve
and
there
is
nothing
but
this
leathern
skin
within
it
how
now
said
elphin
there
may
be
therein
the
value
of
a
hundred
pounds
well
they
took
up
the
leathern
bag
and
he
who
opened
it
saw
the
forehead
of
an
infant
the
fairest
that
ever
was
seen
and
he
said
behold
a
radiant
brow
in
the
welsh
language
taliesin
taliesin
be
he
called
said
elphin
and
he
lifted
the
bag
in
his
arms
and
lamenting
his
bad
luck
placed
the
boy
sorrowfully
behind
him
and
he
made
his
horse
amble
gently
that
before
had
been
trotting
and
he
carried
him
as
softly
as
if
he
had
been
sitting
in
the
easiest
chair
in
the
world
and
presently
the
boy
made
a
consolation
and
praise
to
elphin
and
the
consolation
was
as
you
may
here
see
fair
elphin
cease
to
lament
never
in
gwyddno
weir
was
there
such
good
luck
as
this
night
being
sad
will
not
avail
better
to
trust
in
god
than
to
forbode
ill
weak
and
small
as
i
am
on
the
foaming
beach
of
the
ocean
in
the
day
of
trouble
i
shall
be
of
more
service
to
thee
than
three
hundred
salmon
this
was
the
first
poem
that
taliesin
ever
sung
being
to
console
elphin
in
his
grief
for
that
the
produce
of
the
weir
was
lost
and
what
was
worse
that
all
the
world
would
consider
that
it
was
through
his
fault
and
then
elphin
asked
him
what
he
was
whether
man
or
spirit
and
he
sung
thus
i
have
been
formed
a
comely
person
although
i
am
but
little
i
am
highly
gifted
into
a
dark
leathern
bag
i
was
thrown
and
on
a
boundless
sea
i
was
sent
adrift
from
seas
and
from
mountains
god
brings
wealth
to
the
fortunate
man
then
came
elphin
to
the
house
of
gwyddno
his
father
and
taliesin
with
him
gwyddno
asked
him
if
he
had
had
a
good
haul
at
the
weir
and
he
told
him
that
he
had
got
that
which
was
better
than
fish
what
was
that
said
gwyddno
a
bard
said
elphin
then
said
gwyddno
alas
what
will
he
profit
thee
and
taliesin
himself
replied
and
said
he
will
profit
him
more
than
the
weir
ever
profited
thee
asked
gwyddno
art
thou
able
to
speak
and
thou
so
little
and
taliesin
answered
him
i
am
better
able
to
speak
than
thou
to
question
me
let
me
hear
what
thou
canst
say
quoth
gwyddno
then
taliesin
sang
three
times
have
i
been
born
i
know
by
meditation
all
the
sciences
of
the
world
are
collected
in
my
breast
for
i
know
what
has
been
and
what
hereafter
will
occur
elphin
gave
his
haul
to
his
wife
and
she
nursed
him
tenderly
and
lovingly
thenceforward
elphin
increased
in
riches
more
and
more
day
after
day
and
in
love
and
favor
with
the
king
and
there
abode
taliesin
until
he
was
thirteen
years
old
when
elphin
son
of
gwyddno
went
by
a
christmas
invitation
to
his
uncle
maelgan
gwynedd
who
held
open
court
at
in
the
castle
of
dyganwy
for
all
the
number
of
his
lords
of
both
degrees
both
spiritual
and
temporal
with
a
vast
and
thronged
host
of
knights
and
squires
and
one
arose
and
said
is
there
in
the
whole
world
a
king
so
great
as
maelgan
or
one
on
whom
heaven
has
bestowed
so
many
gifts
as
upon
him
form
and
beauty
and
meekness
and
strength
besides
all
the
powers
of
the
soul
and
together
with
these
they
said
that
heaven
had
given
one
gift
that
exceeded
all
the
others
which
was
the
beauty
and
grace
and
wisdom
and
modesty
of
his
queen
whose
virtues
surpassed
those
of
all
the
ladies
and
noble
maidens
throughout
the
whole
kingdom
and
with
this
they
put
questions
one
to
another
who
had
braver
men
who
had
fairer
or
swifter
horses
or
greyhounds
who
had
more
skilful
or
wiser
bards
than
maelgan
when
they
had
all
made
an
end
of
their
praising
the
king
and
his
gifts
it
befell
that
elphin
spoke
on
this
wise
of
a
truth
none
but
a
king
may
vie
with
a
king
but
were
he
not
a
king
i
would
say
that
my
wife
was
as
virtuous
as
any
lady
in
the
kingdom
and
also
that
i
have
a
bard
who
is
more
skilful
than
all
the
bards
in
a
short
space
some
of
his
fellows
told
the
king
all
the
boastings
of
elphin
and
the
king
ordered
him
to
be
thrown
into
a
strong
prison
until
he
might
show
the
truth
as
to
the
virtues
of
his
wife
and
the
wisdom
of
his
bard
now
when
elphin
had
been
put
in
a
tower
of
the
castle
with
a
thick
chain
about
his
feet
it
is
said
that
it
was
a
silver
chain
because
he
was
of
royal
blood
the
king
as
the
story
relates
sent
his
son
rhun
to
inquire
into
the
demeanor
of
elphin
wife
now
rhun
was
the
most
graceless
man
in
the
world
and
there
was
neither
wife
nor
maiden
with
whom
he
held
converse
but
was
evil
spoken
of
while
rhun
went
in
haste
towards
elphin
dwelling
being
fully
minded
to
bring
disgrace
upon
his
wife
taliesin
told
his
mistress
how
that
the
king
had
placed
his
master
in
durance
in
prison
and
how
that
rhun
was
coming
in
haste
to
strive
to
bring
disgrace
upon
her
wherefore
he
caused
his
mistress
to
array
one
of
the
maids
of
her
kitchen
in
her
apparel
which
the
noble
lady
gladly
did
and
she
loaded
her
hands
with
the
best
rings
that
she
and
her
husband
possessed
in
this
guise
taliesin
caused
his
mistress
to
put
the
maiden
to
sit
at
the
board
in
her
room
at
supper
and
he
made
her
to
seem
as
her
mistress
and
the
mistress
to
seem
as
the
maid
and
when
they
were
in
due
time
seated
at
their
supper
in
the
manner
that
has
been
said
rhun
suddenly
arrived
at
elphin
dwelling
and
was
received
with
joy
for
the
servants
knew
him
and
they
brought
him
to
the
room
of
their
mistress
in
the
semblance
of
whom
the
maid
rose
up
from
supper
and
welcomed
him
gladly
and
afterwards
she
sat
down
to
supper
again
and
rhun
with
her
then
rhun
began
jesting
with
the
maid
who
still
kept
the
semblance
of
her
mistress
and
verily
this
story
shows
that
the
maiden
became
so
intoxicated
that
she
fell
asleep
and
the
story
relates
that
it
was
a
powder
that
rhun
put
into
the
drink
that
made
her
sleep
so
soundly
that
she
never
felt
it
when
he
cut
off
from
her
hand
her
little
finger
whereon
was
the
signet
ring
of
elphin
which
he
had
sent
to
his
wife
as
a
token
a
short
time
before
and
rhun
returned
to
the
king
with
the
finger
and
the
ring
as
a
proof
to
show
that
he
had
cut
it
off
from
her
hand
without
her
awaking
from
her
sleep
of
intemperance
the
king
rejoiced
greatly
at
these
tidings
and
he
sent
for
his
councillors
to
whom
he
told
the
whole
story
from
the
beginning
and
he
caused
elphin
to
be
brought
out
of
prison
and
he
chided
him
because
of
his
boast
and
he
spake
on
this
wise
elphin
be
it
known
to
thee
beyond
a
doubt
that
it
is
but
folly
for
a
man
to
trust
in
the
virtues
of
his
wife
further
than
he
can
see
her
and
that
thou
mayest
be
certain
of
thy
wife
vileness
behold
her
finger
with
thy
signet
ring
upon
it
which
was
cut
from
her
hand
last
night
while
she
slept
the
sleep
of
intoxication
then
thus
spake
elphin
with
thy
leave
mighty
king
i
can
not
deny
my
ring
for
it
is
known
of
many
but
verily
i
assert
that
the
finger
around
which
it
is
was
never
attached
to
the
hand
of
my
wife
for
in
truth
and
certainty
there
are
three
notable
things
pertaining
to
it
none
of
which
ever
belonged
to
any
of
my
wife
fingers
the
first
of
the
three
is
that
it
is
certainly
known
to
me
that
this
ring
would
never
remain
upon
her
thumb
whereas
you
can
plainly
see
that
it
is
hard
to
draw
it
over
the
joint
of
the
little
finger
of
the
hand
whence
this
was
cut
the
second
thing
is
that
my
wife
has
never
let
pass
one
saturday
since
i
have
known
her
without
paring
her
nails
before
going
to
bed
and
you
can
see
fully
that
the
nail
of
this
little
finger
has
not
been
pared
for
a
month
the
third
is
truly
that
the
hand
whence
this
finger
came
was
kneading
rye
dough
within
three
days
before
the
finger
was
cut
therefrom
and
i
can
assure
your
highness
that
my
wife
has
never
kneaded
rye
dough
since
my
wife
she
has
been
the
king
was
mightily
wroth
with
elphin
for
so
stoutly
withstanding
him
respecting
the
goodness
of
his
wife
wherefore
he
ordered
him
to
his
prison
a
second
time
saying
that
he
should
not
be
loosed
thence
until
he
had
proved
the
truth
of
his
boast
as
well
concerning
the
wisdom
of
his
bard
as
the
virtues
of
his
wife
in
the
meantime
his
wife
and
taliesin
remained
joyful
at
dwelling
and
taliesin
showed
his
mistress
how
that
elphin
was
in
prison
because
of
them
but
he
bade
her
be
glad
for
that
he
would
go
to
maelgan
court
to
free
his
master
so
he
took
leave
of
his
mistress
and
came
to
the
court
of
maelgan
who
was
going
to
sit
in
his
hall
and
dine
in
his
royal
state
as
it
was
the
custom
in
those
days
for
kings
and
princes
to
do
at
every
chief
feast
as
soon
as
taliesin
entered
the
hall
he
placed
himself
in
a
quiet
corner
near
the
place
where
the
bards
and
the
minstrels
were
wont
to
come
in
doing
their
service
and
duty
to
the
king
as
is
the
custom
at
the
high
festivals
when
the
bounty
is
proclaimed
so
when
the
bards
and
the
heralds
came
to
cry
largess
and
to
proclaim
the
power
of
the
king
and
his
strength
at
the
moment
when
they
passed
by
the
corner
wherein
he
was
crouching
taliesin
pouted
out
his
lips
after
them
and
played
blerwm
blerwm
with
his
finger
upon
his
lips
neither
took
they
much
notice
of
him
as
they
went
by
but
proceeded
forward
till
they
came
before
the
king
unto
whom
they
made
their
obeisance
with
their
bodies
as
they
were
wont
without
speaking
a
single
word
but
pouting
out
their
lips
and
making
mouths
at
the
king
playing
blerwm
blerwm
upon
their
lips
with
their
fingers
as
they
had
seen
the
boy
do
this
sight
caused
the
king
to
wonder
and
to
deem
within
himself
that
they
were
drunk
with
many
liquors
wherefore
he
commanded
one
of
his
lords
who
served
at
the
board
to
go
to
them
and
desire
them
to
collect
their
wits
and
to
consider
where
they
stood
and
what
it
was
fitting
for
them
to
do
and
this
lord
did
so
gladly
but
they
ceased
not
from
their
folly
any
more
than
before
whereupon
he
sent
to
them
a
second
time
and
a
third
desiring
them
to
go
forth
from
the
hall
at
the
last
the
king
ordered
one
of
his
squires
to
give
a
blow
to
the
chief
of
them
named
heinin
vardd
and
the
squire
took
a
broom
and
struck
him
on
the
head
so
that
he
fell
back
in
his
seat
then
he
arose
and
went
on
his
knees
and
besought
leave
of
the
king
grace
to
show
that
this
their
fault
was
not
through
want
of
knowledge
neither
through
drunkenness
but
by
the
influence
of
some
spirit
that
was
in
the
hall
and
he
spoke
on
this
wise
o
honorable
king
be
it
known
to
your
grace
that
not
from
the
strength
of
drink
or
of
too
much
liquor
are
we
dumb
but
through
the
influence
of
a
spirit
that
sits
in
the
corner
yonder
in
the
form
of
a
child
forthwith
the
king
commanded
the
squire
to
fetch
him
and
he
went
to
the
nook
where
taliesin
sat
and
brought
him
before
the
king
who
asked
him
what
he
was
and
whence
he
came
and
he
answered
the
king
in
verse
primary
chief
bard
am
i
to
elphin
and
my
native
country
is
the
region
of
the
summer
stars
i
have
been
in
asia
with
noah
in
the
ark
i
have
seen
the
destruction
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
i
was
in
india
when
rome
was
built
i
have
now
come
here
to
the
remnant
of
troia
when
the
king
and
his
nobles
had
heard
the
song
they
wondered
much
for
they
had
never
heard
the
like
from
a
boy
so
young
as
he
and
when
the
king
knew
that
he
was
the
bard
of
elphin
he
bade
heinin
his
first
and
wisest
bard
to
answer
taliesin
and
to
strive
with
him
but
when
he
came
he
could
do
no
other
than
play
blerwm
on
his
lips
and
when
he
sent
for
the
others
of
the
four
and
twenty
bards
they
all
did
likewise
and
could
do
no
other
and
maelgan
asked
the
boy
taliesin
what
was
his
errand
and
he
answered
him
in
song
elphin
the
son
of
gwyddno
is
in
the
land
of
artro
secured
by
thirteen
locks
for
praising
his
instructor
therefore
i
taliesin
chief
of
the
bards
of
the
west
will
loosen
elphin
out
of
a
golden
fetter
then
he
sang
to
them
a
riddle
discover
thou
what
is
the
strong
creature
from
before
the
flood
without
flesh
without
bone
without
vein
without
blood
without
head
without
feet
it
will
neither
be
older
nor
younger
than
at
the
beginning
behold
how
the
sea
whitens
when
first
it
comes
when
it
comes
from
the
south
when
it
strikes
on
coasts
it
is
in
the
field
it
is
in
the
wood
but
the
eye
can
not
perceive
it
one
being
has
prepared
it
by
a
tremendous
blast
to
wreak
vengeance
on
maelgan
gwynedd
while
he
was
thus
singing
his
verse
there
arose
a
mighty
storm
of
wind
so
that
the
king
and
all
his
nobles
thought
that
the
castle
would
fall
upon
their
heads
and
the
king
caused
them
to
fetch
elphin
in
haste
from
his
dungeon
and
placed
him
before
taliesin
and
it
is
said
that
immediately
he
sung
a
verse
so
that
the
chains
opened
from
about
his
feet
after
that
taliesin
brought
elphin
wife
before
them
and
showed
that
she
had
not
one
finger
wanting
and
in
this
manner
did
he
set
his
master
free
from
prison
and
protect
the
innocence
of
his
mistress
and
silence
the
bards
so
that
not
one
of
them
dared
to
say
a
word
right
glad
was
elphin
right
glad
was
taliesin
hero
myths
of
the
british
race
beowulf
notable
among
the
names
of
heroes
of
the
british
race
is
that
of
beowulf
which
appeals
to
all
people
in
a
very
special
way
since
he
is
the
one
hero
in
whose
story
we
may
see
the
ideals
of
our
english
forefathers
before
they
left
their
continental
home
to
cross
to
the
islands
of
britain
although
this
hero
had
distinguished
himself
by
numerous
feats
of
strength
during
his
boyhood
and
early
youth
it
was
as
the
deliverer
of
hrothgar
king
of
denmark
from
the
monster
grendel
that
he
first
gained
wide
renown
grendel
was
half
monster
and
half
man
and
had
his
abode
in
the
in
the
vicinity
of
hrothgar
residence
night
after
night
he
would
steal
into
the
king
great
palace
called
heorot
and
slay
sometimes
as
many
as
thirty
at
one
time
of
the
knights
sleeping
there
beowulf
put
himself
at
the
head
of
a
selected
band
of
warriors
went
against
the
monster
and
after
a
terrible
fight
slew
it
the
following
night
grendel
mother
a
fiend
scarcely
less
terrible
than
her
son
carried
off
one
of
hrothgar
boldest
thanes
once
more
beowulf
went
to
the
help
of
the
danish
king
followed
the
to
her
lair
at
the
bottom
of
a
muddy
lake
in
the
midst
of
the
swamp
and
with
his
good
sword
hrunting
and
his
own
muscular
arms
broke
the
neck
upon
his
return
to
his
own
country
of
the
geats
loaded
with
honors
bestowed
upon
him
by
hrothgar
beowulf
served
the
king
of
geatland
as
the
latter
most
trusted
counsellor
and
champion
when
after
many
years
the
king
fell
before
an
enemy
the
geats
unanimously
chose
beowulf
for
their
new
king
his
fame
as
a
warrior
kept
his
country
free
from
invasion
and
his
wisdom
as
a
statesman
increased
its
prosperity
and
happiness
in
the
fiftieth
year
of
beowulf
reign
however
a
great
terror
fell
upon
the
land
in
the
way
of
a
monstrous
which
flew
forth
by
night
from
its
den
in
the
rocks
lighting
up
the
blackness
with
its
blazing
breath
and
burning
houses
and
homesteads
men
and
cattle
with
the
flames
from
its
mouth
when
the
news
came
to
beowulf
that
his
people
were
suffering
and
dying
and
that
no
warrior
dared
to
risk
his
life
in
an
effort
to
deliver
the
country
from
this
deadly
devastation
the
aged
king
took
up
his
shield
and
sword
and
went
forth
to
his
last
fight
at
the
entrance
of
the
dragon
cave
beowulf
raised
his
voice
and
shouted
a
furious
defiance
to
the
awesome
guardian
of
the
den
roaring
hideously
and
napping
his
glowing
wings
together
the
dragon
rushed
forth
and
half
flew
half
sprang
on
beowulf
then
began
a
fearful
combat
which
ended
in
beowulf
piercing
the
scaly
armor
and
inflicting
a
mortal
wound
but
alas
in
himself
being
given
a
gash
in
the
neck
by
his
opponent
poisoned
fangs
which
resulted
in
his
death
as
he
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
his
head
supported
by
wiglaf
an
honored
warrior
who
had
helped
in
the
fight
with
the
dragon
beowulf
roused
himself
to
say
as
he
grasped
wiglaf
hand
thou
must
now
look
to
the
needs
of
the
nation
here
dwell
i
no
longer
for
destiny
calleth
me
bid
thou
my
warriors
after
my
funeral
pyre
build
me
a
high
on
the
head
so
that
the
seafarers
beowulf
barrow
henceforth
shall
name
it
they
who
drive
far
and
wide
over
the
mighty
flood
their
foamy
keels
thou
art
the
last
of
all
the
kindred
of
wagmund
wyrd
has
swept
all
my
kin
all
the
brave
chiefs
away
now
must
i
follow
them
these
last
words
spoken
the
king
of
the
geats
brave
to
seek
danger
and
brave
to
look
on
death
and
fate
undaunted
fell
back
dead
according
to
his
last
desires
his
followers
gathered
wood
and
piled
it
on
the
upon
this
funeral
pyre
was
laid
beowulf
body
and
consumed
to
ashes
then
upon
the
same
cliff
of
hronesness
was
erected
a
huge
burial
cairn
and
lofty
to
be
known
thereafter
as
beowulf
barrow
cuchulain
champion
of
ireland
among
all
the
early
literatures
of
europe
there
are
two
which
at
exactly
opposite
corners
of
the
continent
display
most
strikingly
similar
characteristics
these
are
the
greek
and
the
irish
and
the
legend
of
the
irish
champion
cuchulain
which
well
illustrates
the
similarity
of
the
literatures
bears
so
close
a
resemblance
to
the
story
of
achilles
as
to
win
for
this
hero
the
title
of
the
irish
achilles
certainly
in
reckless
courage
power
of
inspiring
dread
sense
of
personal
merit
and
frankness
of
speech
the
irish
hero
is
fully
equal
to
the
mighty
greek
cuchulain
was
the
nephew
of
king
conor
of
ulster
son
of
his
sister
dechtire
and
it
is
said
that
his
father
was
no
mortal
man
but
the
great
god
lugh
of
the
long
hand
cuchulain
was
brought
up
by
king
conor
himself
and
even
while
he
was
still
a
boy
his
fame
spread
all
over
ireland
his
warlike
deeds
were
those
of
a
proved
warrior
not
of
a
child
of
nursery
age
and
by
the
time
cuchulain
was
seventeen
he
was
without
peer
among
the
champions
of
ulster
upon
cuchulain
marriage
to
emer
daughter
of
forgall
the
wily
a
druid
of
great
power
the
couple
took
up
their
residence
at
armagh
the
capital
of
ulster
under
the
protection
of
king
conor
here
there
was
one
chief
bricriu
of
the
bitter
tongue
who
like
thersites
among
the
grecian
leaders
delighted
in
making
mischief
soon
he
had
on
foot
plans
for
stirring
up
strife
among
the
heroes
of
ulster
leaders
among
whom
were
the
mighty
laegaire
conall
cearnach
cousin
of
cuchulain
and
cuchulain
himself
inviting
the
members
of
king
conor
court
to
dinner
bricriu
arranged
that
a
contest
should
arise
over
who
should
have
the
portion
and
so
successful
was
he
that
to
avoid
a
bloody
fight
the
three
heroes
mentioned
decided
to
submit
their
claims
to
the
championship
of
ireland
to
king
ailill
of
connaught
ailill
put
the
heroes
to
an
unexpected
test
their
dinner
was
served
them
in
a
separate
room
into
which
three
magic
beasts
in
the
shape
of
monstrous
cats
were
sent
by
the
king
when
they
saw
them
laegire
and
conall
rose
from
their
meal
climbed
among
the
rafters
and
stayed
there
all
night
cuchulain
waited
until
one
cat
attacked
him
and
then
drawing
his
sword
struck
the
monster
it
showed
no
further
sign
of
fight
and
at
daybreak
the
magic
beasts
disappeared
as
laegire
and
conall
claimed
that
this
test
was
an
unfair
one
ailill
sent
the
three
rivals
to
curoi
of
kerry
a
just
and
wise
man
who
set
out
to
discover
by
wizardry
and
enchantments
the
best
among
the
heroes
in
turn
they
stood
watch
outside
curoi
castle
where
laegire
and
conall
were
overcome
by
a
huge
giant
who
hurled
spears
of
mighty
oak
trees
and
ended
by
throwing
them
over
the
wall
into
the
courtyard
cuchulain
alone
withstood
the
giant
whereupon
he
was
attacked
by
other
magic
foes
among
these
was
a
dragon
which
flew
on
horrible
wings
from
a
neighboring
lake
and
seemed
ready
to
devour
everything
in
its
way
cuchulain
sprang
up
giving
his
wonderful
thrust
his
arm
into
the
mouth
and
down
its
throat
and
tore
out
its
heart
after
the
monster
fell
dead
he
cut
off
its
scaly
head
as
even
yet
cuchulain
opponents
would
not
admit
his
championship
they
were
all
three
directed
to
return
to
armagh
to
await
curoi
judgment
here
it
happened
that
all
the
ulster
heroes
were
in
the
great
hall
one
night
except
cuchulain
and
his
cousin
conall
as
they
sat
in
order
of
rank
a
terrible
stranger
gigantic
in
stature
hideous
of
aspect
with
ravening
yellow
eyes
entered
in
his
hand
he
bore
an
enormous
axe
with
keen
and
shining
edge
upon
king
conor
inquiring
his
business
there
the
stranger
replied
behold
my
axe
the
man
who
will
grasp
it
may
cut
my
head
off
with
it
provided
that
i
may
in
like
manner
cut
off
his
head
if
you
have
no
champion
who
dare
face
me
i
will
say
that
ulster
has
lost
her
courage
and
is
dishonored
at
once
laegire
accepted
the
challenge
the
giant
laid
his
head
on
a
block
and
at
a
blow
the
hero
severed
it
from
the
body
thereupon
the
giant
arose
took
the
head
and
the
axe
and
thus
headless
strode
from
the
hall
but
the
following
night
when
he
returned
sound
as
ever
to
claim
the
fulfilment
of
promise
the
latter
heart
failed
him
and
he
did
not
come
forward
the
stranger
then
jeered
at
the
men
of
ulster
because
their
great
champion
durst
not
keep
his
agreement
nor
face
the
blow
he
should
receive
in
return
for
the
one
he
gave
the
men
of
ulster
were
utterly
ashamed
but
conall
cearnach
who
was
present
that
night
made
a
new
agreement
with
the
stranger
he
gave
a
blow
which
beheaded
the
giant
but
again
when
the
latter
returned
whole
and
sound
on
the
following
evening
the
champion
was
not
to
be
found
now
it
was
the
turn
of
cuchulain
who
as
the
others
had
done
cut
off
the
giant
head
at
one
stroke
the
next
day
the
members
of
conor
court
watched
cuchulain
to
see
what
he
would
do
they
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
he
had
failed
like
the
others
who
now
were
present
the
champion
however
showed
no
signs
of
failing
or
retreat
he
sat
sorrowfully
in
his
place
and
with
a
sigh
said
to
king
conor
as
they
waited
do
not
leave
this
place
till
all
is
over
death
is
coming
to
me
very
surely
but
i
must
fulfil
my
agreement
for
i
would
rather
die
than
break
my
word
towards
the
close
of
day
the
stranger
strode
into
the
hall
exultant
where
is
cuchulain
he
cried
here
i
am
was
the
reply
ah
poor
boy
your
speech
is
sad
and
the
fear
of
death
lies
heavy
on
you
but
at
least
you
have
redeemed
your
word
and
have
not
failed
me
the
youth
rose
from
his
seat
and
went
towards
him
as
he
stood
with
the
great
axe
ready
and
knelt
to
receive
the
blow
the
hero
of
ulster
laid
his
head
on
the
block
but
the
giant
was
not
satisfied
stretch
out
your
neck
better
said
he
you
are
playing
with
me
to
torment
me
said
cuchulain
slay
me
now
speedily
for
i
did
not
keep
you
waiting
last
night
however
he
stretched
out
his
neck
as
ordered
and
the
stranger
raised
his
axe
till
it
crashed
upwards
through
the
rafters
of
the
hall
like
the
crash
of
trees
falling
in
a
storm
when
the
axe
came
down
with
a
terrific
sound
all
men
looked
fearfully
at
cuchulain
the
descending
axe
had
not
even
touched
him
it
had
come
down
with
the
blunt
side
on
the
ground
and
the
youth
knelt
there
unharmed
smiling
at
him
and
leaning
on
his
axe
stood
no
terrible
and
hideous
stranger
but
curoi
of
kerry
come
to
give
his
decision
at
last
rise
up
cuchulain
said
curoi
there
is
none
among
all
the
heroes
of
ulster
to
equal
you
in
courage
and
loyalty
and
truth
the
championship
of
the
heroes
of
ireland
is
yours
from
this
day
forth
and
the
champion
portion
at
all
feasts
and
to
your
wife
i
adjudge
the
first
place
among
all
the
women
of
ulster
woe
to
him
who
dares
to
dispute
this
decision
thereupon
curoi
vanished
and
the
warriors
gathered
around
cuchulain
and
all
with
one
voice
acclaimed
him
the
champion
of
the
heroes
of
all
ireland
a
title
which
has
clung
to
him
until
this
day
this
is
one
of
many
stories
told
of
the
irish
champion
whose
deeds
of
bravery
would
fill
many
pages
cuchulain
finally
came
to
his
end
on
the
field
of
battle
after
a
fight
in
which
he
displayed
all
his
usual
gallantry
but
in
which
unfair
means
were
used
to
overcome
him
for
wales
and
for
england
during
centuries
arthur
has
been
the
representative
very
gentle
perfect
knight
in
a
similar
way
in

stands
ever
for
the
highest
ideals
of
the
irish
gaels
hereward
the
wake
in
hereward
the
wake
or
watchful
is
found
one
of
those
heroes
whose
date
can
be
ascertained
with
a
fair
amount
of
exactness
and
yet
in
whose
story
occur
mythological
elements
which
seem
to
belong
to
all
ages
the
folklore
of
primitive
races
is
a
great
storehouse
whence
a
people
can
choose
tales
and
heroic
deeds
to
glorify
its
own
national
hero
careless
that
the
same
tales
and
deeds
have
done
duty
for
other
peoples
and
other
heroes
hence
it
happens
that
hereward
the
saxon
a
patriot
hero
as
real
and
actual
as
nelson
or
george
washington
whose
deeds
were
recorded
in
prose
and
verse
within
forty
years
of
his
death
was
even
then
surrounded
by
a
cloud
of
romance
and
mystery
which
hid
in
vagueness
his
family
his
marriage
and
even
his
death
briefly
it
may
be
stated
that
hereward
was
a
native
of
lincolnshire
and
was
in
his
prime
about
in
that
year
he
joined
a
party
of
danes
who
appeared
in
england
attacked
peterborough
and
sacked
the
abbey
there
and
afterward
took
refuge
in
the
isle
of
ely
here
he
was
besieged
by
william
the
conqueror
and
was
finally
forced
to
yield
to
the
norman
he
thus
came
to
stand
for
the
defeated
saxon
race
and
his
name
has
been
passed
down
as
that
of
the
darling
hero
of
the
saxons
for
his
splendid
defence
of
ely
they
forgave
his
final
surrender
to
duke
william
they
attributed
to
him
all
the
virtues
supposed
to
be
inherent
in
the
and
all
the
glorious
valor
on
which
the
english
prided
themselves
and
lastly
they
surrounded
his
death
with
a
halo
of
desperate
fighting
and
made
his
last
conflict
as
wonderful
as
that
of
roland
at
roncesvalles
if
roland
is
the
ideal
of
norman
feudal
chivalry
hereward
is
equally
the
ideal
of
sturdy
manliness
and
knighthood
an
account
of
one
of
hereward
adventures
as
a
youth
will
serve
as
illustration
of
the
stories
told
of
his
prowess
on
an
enforced
visit
to
cornwall
he
found
that
king
alef
a
petty
british
chief
had
betrothed
his
fair
daughter
to
a
terrible
pictish
giant
breaking
off
in
order
to
do
it
her
with
prince
sigtryg
of
waterford
son
of
a
danish
king
in
ireland
hereward
ever
chivalrous
picked
a
quarrel
with
the
giant
and
killed
him
in
fair
fight
whereupon
the
king
threw
him
into
prison
in
the
following
night
however
the
released
princess
arranged
that
the
gallant
saxon
should
be
freed
and
sent
for
her
lover
prince
sigtryg
after
many
adventures
hereward
reached
the
prince
who
hastened
to
return
to
cornwall
with
the
young
hero
but
to
the
grief
of
both
they
learned
upon
their
arrival
that
the
princess
had
just
been
betrothed
to
a
wild
cornish
hero
haco
and
the
wedding
feast
was
to
be
held
that
very
day
sigtryg
at
once
sent
a
troop
of
forty
danes
to
king
alef
demanding
the
fulfilment
of
the
between
himself
and
his
daughter
and
threatening
vengeance
if
it
were
broken
to
this
threat
the
king
returned
no
answer
and
no
dane
came
back
to
tell
of
their
reception
sigtryg
would
have
waited
till
morning
trusting
in
the
honor
of
the
king
but
hereward
disguised
himself
as
a
minstrel
and
obtained
admission
to
the
bridal
feast
where
he
soon
won
applause
by
his
beautiful
singing
the
bridegroom
haco
in
a
rapture
offered
him
any
boon
he
liked
to
ask
but
he
demanded
only
a
cup
of
wine
from
the
hands
of
the
bride
when
she
brought
it
to
him
he
flung
into
the
empty
cup
the
betrothal
ring
the
token
she
had
sent
to
sigtryg
and
said
i
thank
thee
lady
and
would
reward
thee
for
thy
gentleness
to
a
wandering
minstrel
i
give
back
the
cup
richer
than
before
by
the
kind
thoughts
of
which
it
bears
the
token
the
princess
looked
at
him
gazed
into
the
goblet
and
saw
her
ring
then
looking
again
she
recognized
her
deliverer
and
knew
that
rescue
was
at
hand
while
men
feasted
hereward
listened
and
talked
and
found
out
that
the
forty
danes
were
prisoners
to
be
released
on
the
morrow
when
haco
was
sure
of
his
bride
but
released
useless
and
miserable
since
they
would
be
turned
adrift
blinded
haco
was
taking
his
lovely
bride
back
to
his
own
land
and
hereward
saw
that
any
rescue
to
be
successful
must
be
attempted
on
the
march
returning
to
sigtryg
the
young
saxon
told
all
that
he
had
learned
and
the
danes
planned
an
ambush
in
the
ravine
where
haco
had
decided
to
blind
and
set
free
his
captives
the
whole
was
carried
out
exactly
as
hereward
arranged
it
the
cornishmen
with
the
danish
captives
passed
first
without
attack
next
came
haco
riding
grim
and
ferocious
beside
his
silent
bride
he
exulting
in
his
success
she
looking
eagerly
for
any
signs
of
rescue
as
they
passed
hereward
sprang
from
his
shelter
crying
upon
them
danes
and
set
your
brethren
free
and
himself
struck
down
haco
and
smote
off
his
head
there
was
a
short
struggle
but
soon
the
rescued
danes
were
able
to
aid
their
deliverers
and
the
cornish
guards
were
all
slain
the
men
of
king
alef
never
very
zealous
for
the
cause
of
haco
fled
and
the
danes
were
left
masters
of
the
field
sigtryg
had
in
the
meantime
seen
to
the
safety
of
the
princess
and
now
placing
her
between
himself
and
hereward
he
escorted
her
to
the
ship
which
soon
brought
them
to
waterford
and
a
happy
bridal
the
prince
and
princess
of
waterford
always
recognized
in
hereward
their
deliverer
and
best
friend
and
in
their
gratitude
wished
him
to
dwell
with
them
always
but
the
hero
roving
and
daring
temper
forbade
his
settling
down
but
rather
urged
him
on
to
deeds
of
arms
in
other
lands
where
he
quickly
won
a
renown
second
to
none
robin
hood
among
the
earliest
heirlooms
of
the
tongue
are
the
songs
and
legends
of
robin
hood
and
his
merry
outlaws
which
have
charmed
readers
young
and
old
for
more
than
six
hundred
years
these
entertaining
stories
date
back
to
the
time
when
chaucer
wrote
his
canterbury
tales
when
the
minstrel
and
scribe
stood
in
the
place
of
the
more
prim
and
precise
modern
printed
book
the
question
of
whether
or
not
robin
hood
was
a
real
person
has
been
asked
for
many
years
just
as
a
similar
question
has
been
asked
about
william
tell
and
others
whom
everyone
would
much
rather
accept
on
faith
it
can
not
be
answered
by
a
brief
yes
or
no
even
though
learned
men
have
pored
over
ancient
records
and
have
written
books
on
the
subject
according
to
the
general
belief
robin
was
an
outlaw
in
the
reign
of
richard
i
when
in
the
depths
of
sherwood
forest
he
entertained
one
hundred
tall
men
all
good
archers
with
the
spoil
he
took
but
he
suffered
no
woman
to
be
oppressed
or
otherwise
molested
poore
men
goods
he
spared
abundantlie
relieving
them
with
that
which
by
theft
he
got
from
abbeys
and
houses
of
rich
carles
consequently
robin
was
an
immense
favorite
with
the
common
people
this
popularity
extended
from
the
leader
to
all
the
members
of
his
hardy
band
god
save
robin
hood
and
all
his
good
yeomanry
is
the
ending
of
many
old
ballads
the
clever
archer
who
could
outshoot
his
fellows
the
brave
yeoman
inured
to
blows
and
the
man
who
could
be
true
to
his
friends
through
thick
and
thin
were
favorites
for
all
time
and
they
have
been
idealized
in
the
persons
of
robin
hood
and
his
merry
outlaws
one
of
the
stories
of
this
picturesque
figure
of
early
english
times
is
that
given
by
sir
walter
scott
in
ivanhoe
concerning
the
archery
contest
during
the
rule
or
misrule
of
prince
john
in
the
absence
of
richard
from
the
kingdom
robin
hood
under
the
assumed
name
of
locksley
boldly
presents
himself
at
a
royal
tournament
at
ashby
as
competitor
for
the
prize
in
shooting
with
the
from
the
eight
or
ten
archers
who
enter
the
contest
the
number
finally
narrows
down
to
two
hubert
a
forester
in
the
service
of
one
of
the
king
nobles
and
locksley
or
robin
hood
hubert
takes
the
first
shot
in
the
final
trial
of
skill
and
lands
his
arrow
within
the
inner
ring
of
the
target
but
not
exactly
in
the
centre
have
not
allowed
for
the
wind
hubert
said
locksley
that
had
been
a
better
shot
so
saying
and
without
showing
the
least
anxiety
to
pause
upon
his
aim
locksley
stepped
to
the
appointed
station
and
shot
his
arrow
as
carelessly
in
appearance
as
if
he
had
not
even
looked
at
the
mark
he
was
speaking
almost
at
the
instant
that
the
shaft
left
the
yet
it
alighted
in
the
target
two
inches
nearer
to
the
white
spot
which
marked
the
centre
than
that
of
hubert
the
light
of
heaven
said
prince
john
to
hubert
thou
suffer
that
runagate
knave
to
overcome
thee
thou
art
worthy
of
the
gallows
hubert
had
but
one
set
speech
for
all
occasions
your
highness
were
to
hang
me
he
said
man
can
but
do
his
best
nevertheless
my
grandsire
drew
a
good
bow
foul
fiend
on
thy
grandsire
and
all
his
generation
interrupted
john
knave
and
shoot
thy
best
or
it
shall
be
worse
for
thee
thus
exhorted
hubert
resumed
his
place
and
not
neglecting
the
caution
which
he
had
received
from
his
adversary
he
made
the
necessary
allowance
for
a
very
light
air
of
wind
which
had
just
risen
and
shot
so
successfully
that
his
arrow
alighted
in
the
very
centre
of
the
target
hubert
a
hubert
shouted
the
populace
more
interested
in
a
known
person
than
in
a
stranger
the
clout
in
the
clout
a
hubert
forever
canst
not
mend
that
shot
locksley
said
the
prince
with
an
insulting
smile
will
notch
his
shaft
for
him
however
replied
locksley
and
letting
fly
his
arrow
with
a
little
more
precaution
than
before
it
lighted
right
upon
that
of
his
competitor
which
it
split
to
shivers
the
people
who
stood
around
were
so
astonished
at
his
wonderful
dexterity
that
they
could
not
even
give
vent
to
their
surprise
in
their
usual
clamor
must
be
the
devil
and
no
man
of
flesh
and
blood
whispered
the
yeomen
to
each
other
archery
was
never
seen
since
a
bow
was
first
bent
in
britain
now
said
locksley
will
crave
your
grace
permission
to
plant
such
a
mark
as
is
used
in
the
north
country
and
welcome
every
brave
yeoman
who
shall
try
a
shot
at
it
to
win
a
smile
from
the
bonny
lass
he
loves
best
locksley
thereupon
sets
up
a
willow
wand
six
feet
long
and
as
thick
as
a
man
thumb
hubert
is
forced
to
decline
the
honor
of
taking
part
in
such
a
trial
of
archery
skill
but
his
rival
easily
splits
the
wand
at
a
distance
of
three
hundred
feet
and
carries
off
the
prize
even

john
in
admiration
of

locksley
however
declares
that
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
enter

service
generously
shares
his

with

to
his

of

good

legends
of
charlemagne
introduction
those
who
have
investigated
the
origin
of
the
romantic
fables
relating
to
charlemagne
and
his
peers
are
of
opinion
that
the
deeds
of
charles
martel
and
perhaps
of
other
charleses
have
been
blended
in
popular
tradition
with
those
properly
belonging
to
charlemagne
it
was
indeed
a
most
momentous
era
and
if
our
readers
will
have
patience
before
entering
on
the
perusal
of
the
fabulous
annals
which
we
are
about
to
lay
before
them
to
take
a
rapid
survey
of
the
real
history
of
the
times
they
will
find
it
hardly
less
romantic
than
the
tales
of
the
poets
in
the
century
beginning
from
the
year
the
countries
bordering
upon
the
native
land
of
our
saviour
to
the
east
and
south
had
not
yet
received
his
religion
arabia
was
the
seat
of
an
idolatrous
religion
resembling
that
of
the
ancient
persians
who
worshipped
the
sun
moon
and
stars
in
mecca
in
the
year
mahomet
was
born
and
here
at
the
age
of
forty
he
proclaimed
himself
the
prophet
of
god
in
dignity
as
superior
to
christ
as
christ
had
been
to
moses
having
obtained
by
slow
degrees
a
considerable
number
of
disciples
he
resorted
to
arms
to
diffuse
his
religion
the
energy
and
zeal
of
his
followers
aided
by
the
weakness
of
the
neighboring
nations
enabled
him
and
his
successors
to
spread
the
sway
of
arabia
and
the
religion
of
mahomet
over
the
countries
to
the
east
as
far
as
the
indus
northward
over
persia
and
asia
minor
westward
over
egypt
and
the
southern
shores
of
the
mediterranean
and
thence
over
the
principal
portion
of
spain
all
this
was
done
within
one
hundred
years
from
the
hegira
or
flight
of
mahomet
from
mecca
to
medina
which
happened
in
the
year
and
is
the
era
from
which
mahometans
reckon
time
as
we
do
from
the
birth
of
christ
from
spain
the
way
was
open
for
the
saracens
so
the
followers
of
mahomet
were
called
into
france
the
conquest
of
which
if
achieved
would
have
been
followed
very
probably
by
that
of
all
the
rest
of
europe
and
would
have
resulted
in
the
banishment
of
christianity
from
the
earth
for
christianity
was
not
at
that
day
universally
professed
even
by
those
nations
which
we
now
regard
as
foremost
in
civilization
great
part
of
germany
britain
denmark
and
russia
were
still
pagan
or
barbarous
at
that
time
there
ruled
in
france
though
without
the
title
of
king
the
first
of
those
illustrious
charleses
of
whom
we
have
spoken
charles
martel
the
grandfather
of
charlemagne
the
saracens
of
spain
had
made
incursions
into
france
in
and
and
had
retired
carrying
with
them
a
vast
booty
in
anbessa
who
was
then
the
saracen
governor
of
spain
crossed
the
pyrenees
with
a
numerous
army
and
took
by
storm
the
strong
town
of
carcassone
so
great
was
the
terror
excited
by
this
invasion
that
the
country
for
a
wide
extent
submitted
to
the
conqueror
and
a
mahometan
governor
for
the
province
was
appointed
and
installed
at
narbonne
anbessa
however
received
a
fatal
wound
in
one
of
his
engagements
and
the
saracens
being
thus
checked
from
further
advance
retired
to
narbonne
in
the
saracens
again
invaded
france
under
abdalrahman
advanced
rapidly
to
the
banks
of
the
garonne
and
laid
siege
to
bordeaux
the
city
was
taken
by
assault
and
delivered
up
to
the
soldiery
the
invaders
still
pressed
forward
and
spread
over
the
territories
of
orleans
auxerre
and
sens
their
advanced
parties
were
suddenly
called
in
by
their
chief
who
had
received
information
of
the
rich
abbey
of
martin
of
tours
and
resolved
to
plunder
and
destroy
it
charles
during
all
this
time
had
done
nothing
to
oppose
the
saracens
for
the
reason
that
the
portion
of
france
over
which
their
incursions
had
been
made
was
not
at
that
time
under
his
dominion
but
constituted
an
independent
kingdom
under
the
name
of
aquitaine
of
which
eude
was
king
but
now
charles
became
convinced
of
the
danger
and
prepared
to
encounter
it
abdalrahman
was
advancing
toward
tours
when
intelligence
of
the
approach
of
charles
at
the
head
of
an
army
of
franks
compelled
him
to
fall
back
upon
poitiers
in
order
to
seize
an
advantageous
field
of
battle
charles
martel
had
called
together
his
warriors
from
every
part
of
his
dominions
and
at
the
head
of
such
an
army
as
had
hardly
ever
been
seen
in
france
crossed
the
loire
probably
at
orleans
and
being
joined
by
the
remains
of
the
army
of
aquitaine
came
in
sight
of
the
arabs
in
the
month
of
october
the
saracens
seem
to
have
been
aware
of
the
terrible
enemy
they
were
now
to
encounter
and
for
the
first
time
these
formidable
conquerors
hesitated
the
two
armies
remained
in
presence
during
seven
days
before
either
ventured
to
begin
the
attack
but
at
length
the
signal
for
battle
was
given
by
abdalrahman
and
the
immense
mass
of
the
saracen
army
rushed
with
fury
on
the
franks
but
the
heavy
line
of
the
northern
warriors
remained
like
a
rock
and
the
saracens
during
nearly
the
whole
day
expended
their
strength
in
vain
attempts
to
make
any
impression
upon
them
at
length
about
four
in
the
afternoon
when
abdalrahman
was
preparing
for
a
new
and
desperate
attempt
to
break
the
line
of
the
franks
a
terrible
clamor
was
heard
in
the
rear
of
the
saracens
it
was
king
eude
who
with
his
aquitanians
had
attacked
their
camp
and
a
great
part
of
the
saracen
army
rushed
tumultuously
from
the
field
to
protect
their
plunder
in
this
moment
of
confusion
the
line
of
the
franks
advanced
and
sweeping
the
field
before
it
carried
fearful
slaughter
amongst
the
enemy
abdalrahman
made
desperate
efforts
to
rally
his
troops
but
when
he
himself
with
the
bravest
of
his
officers
fell
beneath
the
swords
of
the
christians
all
order
disappeared
and
the
remains
of
his
army
sought
refuge
in
their
immense
camp
from
which
eude
and
his
aquitanians
had
been
repulsed
it
was
now
late
and
charles
unwilling
to
risk
an
attack
on
the
camp
in
the
dark
withdrew
his
army
and
passed
the
night
in
the
plain
expecting
to
renew
the
battle
in
the
morning
accordingly
when
daylight
came
the
franks
drew
up
in
order
of
battle
but
no
enemy
appeared
and
when
at
last
they
ventured
to
approach
the
saracen
camp
they
found
it
empty
the
invaders
had
taken
advantage
of
the
night
to
begin
their
retreat
and
were
already
on
their
way
back
to
spain
leaving
their
immense
plunder
behind
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
franks
this
was
the
celebrated
battle
of
tours
in
which
vast
numbers
of
the
saracens
were
slain
and
only
fifteen
hundred
of
the
franks
charles
received
the
surname
of
martel
the
hammer
in
consequence
of
this
victory
the
saracens
notwithstanding
this
severe
blow
continued
to
hold
their
ground
in
the
south
of
france
but
pepin
the
son
of
charles
martel
who
succeeded
to
his
father
power
and
assumed
the
title
of
king
successively
took
from
them
the
strong
places
they
held
and
in
by
the
capture
of
narbonne
their
capital
extinguished
the
remains
of
their
power
in
france
charlemagne
or
charles
the
great
succeeded
his
father
pepin
on
the
throne
in
the
year
this
prince
though
the
hero
of
numerous
romantic
legends
appears
greater
in
history
than
in
fiction
whether
we
regard
him
as
a
warrior
or
as
a
legislator
as
a
patron
of
learning
or
as
the
civilizer
of
a
barbarous
nation
he
is
entitled
to
our
warmest
admiration
such
he
is
in
history
but
the
romancers
represent
him
as
often
weak
and
passionate
the
victim
of
treacherous
counsellors
and
at
the
mercy
of
turbulent
barons
on
whose
prowess
he
depends
for
the
maintenance
of
his
throne
the
historical
representation
is
doubtless
the
true
one
for
it
is
handed
down
in
trustworthy
records
and
is
confirmed
by
the
events
of
the
age
at
the
height
of
his
power
the
french
empire
extended
over
what
we
now
call
france
germany
switzerland
holland
belgium
and
great
part
of
italy
in
the
year
charlemagne
being
in
rome
whither
he
had
gone
with
a
numerous
army
to
protect
the
pope
was
crowned
by
the
pontiff
emperor
of
the
west
on
christmas
day
charles
entered
the
church
of
peter
as
if
merely
to
take
his
part
in
the
celebration
of
the
mass
with
the
rest
of
the
congregation
when
he
approached
the
altar
and
stooped
in
the
act
of
prayer
the
pope
stepped
forward
and
placed
a
crown
of
gold
upon
his
head
and
immediately
the
roman
people
shouted
life
and
victory
to
charles
the
august
crowned
by
god
the
great
and
pacific
emperor
of
the
romans
the
pope
then
prostrated
himself
before
him
and
paid
him
reverence
according
to
the
custom
established
in
the
times
of
the
ancient
emperors
and
concluded
the
ceremony
by
anointing
him
with
consecrated
oil
charlemagne
wars
were
chiefly
against
the
pagan
and
barbarous
people
who
under
the
name
of
saxons
inhabited
the
countries
now
called
hanover
and
holland
he
also
led
expeditions
against
the
saracens
of
spain
but
his
wars
with
the
saracens
were
not
carried
on
as
the
romances
assert
in
france
but
on
the
soil
of
spain
he
entered
spain
by
the
eastern
pyrenees
and
made
an
easy
conquest
of
barcelona
and
pampeluna
but
saragossa
refused
to
open
her
gates
to
him
and
charles
ended
by
negotiating
and
accepting
a
vast
sum
of
gold
as
the
price
of
his
return
over
the
pyrenees
on
his
way
back
he
marched
with
his
whole
army
through
the
gorges
of
the
mountains
by
way
of
the
valleys
of
engui
eno
and
roncesvalles
the
chief
of
this
region
had
waited
upon
charlemagne
on
his
advance
as
a
faithful
vassal
of
the
monarchy
but
now
on
the
return
of
the
franks
he
had
called
together
all
the
wild
mountaineers
who
acknowledged
him
as
their
chief
and
they
occupied
the
heights
of
the
mountains
under
which
the
army
had
to
pass
the
main
body
of
the
troops
met
with
no
obstruction
and
received
no
intimation
of
danger
but
the
which
was
considerably
behind
and
encumbered
with
its
plunder
was
overwhelmed
by
the
mountaineers
in
the
pass
of
roncesvalles
and
slain
to
a
man
some
of
the
bravest
of
the
prankish
chiefs
perished
on
this
occasion
among
whom
is
mentioned
roland
or
orlando
governor
of
the
marches
or
frontier
of
brittany
his
name
became
famous
in
after
times
and
the
disaster
of
roncesvalles
and
death
of
roland
became
eventually
the
most
celebrated
episode
in
the
vast
cycle
of
romance
though
after
this
there
were
hostile
encounters
between
the
armies
of
charlemagne
and
the
saracens
they
were
of
small
account
and
generally
on
the
soil
of
spain
thus
the
historical
foundation
for
the
stories
of
the
romancers
is
but
scanty
unless
we
suppose
the
events
of
an
earlier
and
of
a
later
age
to
be
incorporated
with
those
of
charlemagne
own
time
there
is
however
a
pretended
history
which
for
a
long
time
was
admitted
as
authentic
and
attributed
to
turpin
archbishop
of
rheims
a
real
personage
of
the
time
of
charlemagne
its
title
is
history
of
charles
the
great
and
orlando
it
is
now
unhesitatingly
considered
as
a
collection
of
popular
traditions
produced
by
some
credulous
and
unscrupulous
monk
who
thought
to
give
dignity
to
his
romance
by
ascribing
its
authorship
to
a
known
and
eminent
individual
it
introduces
its
pretended
author
bishop
turpin
in
this
manner
turpin
archbishop
of
rheims
the
friend
and
secretary
of
charles
the
great
excellently
skilled
in
sacred
and
profane
literature
of
a
genius
equally
adapted
to
prose
and
verse
the
advocate
of
the
poor
beloved
of
god
in
his
life
and
conversation
who
often
fought
the
saracens
hand
to
hand
by
the
emperor
side
he
relates
the
acts
of
charles
the
great
in
one
book
and
flourished
under
charles
and
his
son
louis
to
the
year
of
our
lord
eight
hundred
and
thirty
the
titles
of
some
of
archbishop
turpin
chapters
will
show
the
nature
of
his
history
they
are
these
of
the
walls
of
pampeluna
that
fell
of
themselves
of
the
war
of
the
holy
facundus
where
the
spears
grew
certain
of
the
christians
fixed
their
spears
in
the
evening
erect
in
the
ground
before
the
castle
and
found
them
in
the
morning
covered
with
bark
and
branches
how
the
sun
stood
still
for
three
days
and
of
the
slaughter
of
four
thousand
saracens
turpin
history
has
perhaps
been
the
source
of
the
marvellous
adventures
which
succeeding
poets
and
romancers
have
accumulated
around
the
names
of
charlemagne
and
his
paladins
or
peers
but
ariosto
and
the
other
italian
poets
have
drawn
from
different
sources
and
doubtless
often
from
their
own
invention
numberless
other
stories
which
they
attribute
to
the
same
heroes
not
hesitating
to
quote
as
their
authority
the
good
turpin
though
his
history
contains
no
trace
of
them
and
the
more
outrageous
the
improbability
or
rather
the
impossibility
of
their
narrations
the
more
attentive
are
they
to
cite
the
archbishop
generally
adding
their
testimonial
to
his
unquestionable
veracity
the
principal
italian
poets
who
have
sung
the
adventures
of
the
peers
of
charlemagne
are
pulci
boiardo
and
ariosto
the
characters
of
orlando
rinaldo
astolpho
gano
and
others
are
the
same
in
all
though
the
adventures
attributed
to
them
are
different

us
of
the

of
orlando
ariosto
of
his
disappointment
and
consequent
madness
pulci
of
his
death
ogier
the
dane
is
a
real
personage
history
agrees
with
romance
in
representing
him
as
a
powerful
lord
who
originally
from
denmark
and
a
pagan
embraced
christianity
and
took
service
under
charlemagne
he
revolted
from
the
emperor
and
was
driven
into
exile
he
afterwards
led
one
of
those
bands
of
piratical
northmen
which
ravaged
france
under
the
reigns
of
charlemagne
degenerate
successors
the
description
which
an
ancient
chronicler
gives
of
charlemagne
as
described
by
ogier
is
so
picturesque
that
we
are
tempted
to
transcribe
it
charlemagne
was
advancing
to
the
siege
of
pavia
didier
king
of
the
lombards
was
in
the
city
with
ogier
to
whom
he
had
given
refuge
when
they
learned
that
the
king
was
approaching
they
mounted
a
high
tower
whence
they
could
see
far
and
wide
over
the
country
they
first
saw
advancing
the
engines
of
war
fit
for
the
armies
of
darius
or
julius
caesar
is
charlemagne
said
didier
said
ogier
the
lombard
next
saw
a
vast
body
of
soldiers
who
filled
all
the
plain
charles
advanced
with
that
host
said
the
king
yet
replied
ogier
hope
for
us
resumed
the
king
he
brings
with
him
a
greater
host
than
that
at
last
charles
appeared
his
head
covered
with
an
iron
helmet
his
hands
with
iron
gloves
his
breast
and
shoulders
with
a
cuirass
of
iron
his
left
hand
holding
an
iron
lance
while
his
right
hand
grasped
his
sword
those
who
went
before
the
monarch
those
who
marched
at
his
side
and
those
who
followed
him
all
had
similar
arms
iron
covered
the
fields
and
the
roads
iron
points
reflected
the
rays
of
the
sun
this
iron
so
hard
was
borne
by
a
people
whose
hearts
were
harder
still
the
blaze
of
the
weapons
flashed
terror
into
the
streets
of
the
city
this
picture
of
charlemagne
in
his
military
aspect
would
be
incomplete
without
a
corresponding
one
of
his
mood
of
peace
one
of
the
greatest
of
modern
historians
guizot
has
compared
the
glory
of
charlemagne
to
a
brilliant
meteor
rising
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
of
barbarism
to
disappear
no
less
suddenly
in
the
darkness
of
feudalism
but
the
light
of
this
meteor
was
not
extinguished
and
reviving
civilization
owed
much
that
was
permanently
beneficial
to
the
great
emperor
of
the
franks
his
ruling
hand
is
seen
in
the
legislation
of
his
time
as
well
as
in
the
administration
of
the
laws
he
encouraged
learning
he
upheld
the
clergy
who
were
the
only
peaceful
and
intellectual
class
against
the
encroaching
and
turbulent
barons
he
was
an
affectionate
father
and
watched
carefully
over
the
education
of
his
children
both
sons
and
daughters
of
his
encouragement
of
learning
we
will
give
some
particulars
he
caused
learned
men
to
be
brought
from
italy
and
from
other
foreign
countries
to
revive
the
public
schools
of
france
which
had
been
prostrated
by
the
disorders
of
preceding
times
he
recompensed
these
learned
men
liberally
and
kept
some
of
them
near
himself
honoring
them
with
his
friendship
of
these
the
most
celebrated
is
alcuin
an
englishman
whose
writings
still
remain
and
prove
him
to
have
been
both
a
learned
and
a
wise
man
with
the
assistance
of
alcuin
and
others
like
him
he
founded
an
academy
or
royal
school
which
should
have
the
direction
of
the
studies
of
all
the
schools
of
the
kingdom
charlemagne
himself
was
a
member
of
this
academy
on
equal
terms
with
the
rest
he
attended
its
meetings
and
fulfilled
all
the
duties
of
an
academician
each
member
took
the
name
of
some
famous
man
of
antiquity
alcuin
called
himself
horace
another
took
the
name
of
augustin
a
third
of
pindar
charlemagne
who
knew
the
psalms
by
heart
and
who
had
an
ambition
to
be
according
to
his
conception
a
king
after
own
heart
received
from
his
brother
academicians
the
name
of
david
of
the
respect
entertained
for
him
by
foreign
nations
an
interesting
proof
is
afforded
in
the
embassy
sent
to
him
by
the
caliph
of
the
arabians
the
celebrated
haroun
al
raschid
a
prince
in
character
and
conduct
not
unlike
to
charlemagne
the
ambassadors
brought
with
them
besides
other
rich
presents
a
clock
the
first
that
was
seen
in
europe
which
excited
universal
admiration
it
had
the
form
of
a
edifice
with
twelve
doors
these
doors
formed
niches
in
each
of
which
was
a
little
statue
representing
one
of
the
hours
at
the
striking
of
the
hour
the
doors
one
for
each
stroke
was
seen
to
open
and
from
the
doors
to
issue
as
many
of
the
little
statues
which
following
one
another
marched
gravely
round
the
tower
the
motion
of
the
clock
was
caused
by
water
and
the
striking
was
effected
by
balls
of
brass
equal
to
the
number
of
the
hours
which
fell
upon
a
cymbal
of
the
same
metal
the
number
falling
being
determined
by
the
discharge
of
the
water
which
as
it
sunk
in
the
vessel
allowed
their
escape
charlemagne
was
succeeded
by
his
son
louis
a
but
feeble
prince
in
whose
reign
the
fabric
reared
by
charles
began
rapidly
to
crumble
louis
was
followed
successively
by
two
charleses
incapable
princes
whose
weak
and
often
tyrannical
conduct
is
no
doubt
the
source
of
incidents
of
that
character
ascribed
in
the
romances
to
charlemagne
the
lawless
and
disobedient
deportment
of
charles
paladins
instances
of
which
are
so
frequent
in
the
romantic
legends
was
also
a
trait
of
the
declining
empire
but
not
of
that
of
charlemagne
the
peers
or
paladins
the
twelve
most
illustrious
knights
of
charlemagne
were
called
peers
for
the
equality
that
reigned
among
them
while
the
name
of
paladins
also
conferred
on
them
implies
that
they
were
inmates
of
the
palace
and
companions
of
the
king
their
names
are
always
given
alike
by
the
romancers
yet
we
may
enumerate
the
most
distinguished
of
them
as
follows
orlando
or
roland
the
former
the
italian
the
latter
the
french
form
of
the
name
favorite
nephew
of
charlemagne
rinaldo
of
montalban
cousin
of
orlando
namo
duke
of
bavaria
salomon
king
of
brittany
turpin
the
archbishop
astolpho
of
england
ogier
the
dane
malagigi
the
enchanter
and
florismart
the
friend
of
orlando
there
were
others
who
are
sometimes
named
as
paladins
and
the
number
can
not
be
strictly
limited
to
twelve
charlemagne
himself
must
be
counted
one
and
ganelon
or
gano
of
mayence
the
treacherous
enemy
of
all
the
rest
was
rated
high
on
the
list
by
his
deluded
sovereign
who
was
completely
the
victim
of
his
arts
we
shall
introduce
more
particularly
to
our
readers
a
few
of
the
principal
peers
leaving
the
others
to
make
their
own
introduction
as
they
appear
in
the
course
of
our
narrative
we
begin
with
orlando
orlando
milon
or
milone
a
knight
of
great
family
and
distantly
related
to
charlemagne
having
secretly
married
bertha
the
sister
was
banished
from
france
and
excommunicated
by
the
pope
after
a
long
and
miserable
wandering
on
foot
as
mendicants
milon
and
his
wife
arrived
at
sutri
in
italy
where
they
took
refuge
in
a
cave
and
in
that
cave
orlando
was
born
there
his
mother
continued
deriving
a
scanty
support
from
the
compassion
of
the
neighboring
peasants
while
milon
in
quest
of
honor
and
fortune
went
into
foreign
lands
orlando
grew
up
among
the
children
of
the
peasantry
surpassing
them
all
in
strength
and
manly
graces
among
his
companions
in
age
though
in
station
far
more
elevated
was
oliver
son
of
the
governor
of
the
town
between
the
two
boys
a
feud
arose
that
led
to
a
fight
in
which
orlando
thrashed
his
rival
but
this
did
not
prevent
a
friendship
springing
up
between
the
two
which
lasted
through
life
orlando
was
so
poor
that
he
was
sometimes
half
naked
as
he
was
a
favorite
of
the
boys
one
day
four
of
them
brought
some
cloth
to
make
him
clothes
two
brought
white
and
two
red
and
from
this
circumstance
orlando
took
his
or
quarterings
when
charlemagne
was
on
his
way
to
rome
to
receive
the
imperial
crown
he
dined
in
public
in
sutri
orlando
and
his
mother
that
day
had
nothing
to
eat
and
orlando
coming
suddenly
upon
the
royal
party
and
seeing
abundance
of
provisions
seized
from
the
attendants
as
much
as
he
could
carry
off
and
made
good
his
retreat
in
spite
of
their
resistance
the
emperor
being
told
of
this
incident
was
reminded
of
an
intimation
he
had
received
in
a
dream
and
ordered
the
boy
to
be
followed
this
was
done
by
three
of
the
knights
whom
orlando
would
have
encountered
with
a
cudgel
on
their
entering
the
grotto
had
not
his
mother
restrained
him
when
they
heard
from
her
who
she
was
they
threw
themselves
at
her
feet
and
promised
to
obtain
her
pardon
from
the
emperor
this
was
easily
effected
orlando
was
received
into
favor
by
the
emperor
returned
with
him
to
france
and
so
distinguished
himself
that
he
became
the
most
powerful
support
of
the
throne
and
of
christianity
footnote
it
is
plain
that
shakspeare
borrowed
from
this
source
the
similar
incident
in
his
as
you
like
it
the
names
of
characters
in
the
play
orlando
oliver
rowland
indicate
the
same
thing
roland
and
ferragus
orlando
or
roland
particularly
distinguished
himself
by
his
combat
with
ferragus
ferragus
was
a
giant
and
moreover
his
skin
was
of
such
impenetrable
stuff
that
no
sword
could
make
any
impression
upon
it
the
giant
mode
of
fighting
was
to
seize
his
adversary
in
his
arms
and
carry
him
off
in
spite
of
all
the
struggles
he
could
make
roland
utmost
skill
only
availed
to
keep
him
out
of
the
giant
clutches
but
all
his
efforts
to
wound
him
with
the
sword
were
useless
after
long
fighting
ferragus
was
so
weary
that
he
proposed
a
truce
and
when
it
was
agreed
upon
he
lay
down
and
immediately
fell
asleep
he
slept
in
perfect
security
for
it
was
against
all
the
laws
of
chivalry
to
take
advantage
of
an
adversary
under
such
circumstances
but
ferragus
lay
so
uncomfortably
for
the
want
of
a
pillow
that
orlando
took
pity
upon
him
and
brought
a
smooth
stone
and
placed
it
under
his
head
when
the
giant
woke
up
after
a
refreshing
nap
and
perceived
what
orlando
had
done
he
seemed
quite
grateful
became
sociable
and
talked
freely
in
the
usual
boastful
style
of
such
characters
among
other
things
he
told
orlando
that
he
need
not
attempt
to
kill
him
with
a
sword
for
that
every
part
of
his
body
was
invulnerable
except
this
and
as
he
spoke
he
put
his
hand
to
the
vital
part
just
in
the
middle
of
his
breast
aided
by
this
information
orlando
succeeded
when
the
fight
was
renewed
in
piercing
the
giant
in
the
very
spot
he
had
pointed
out
and
giving
him
a
great
was
the
rejoicing
in
the
christian
camp
and
many
the
praises
showered
upon
the
victorious
paladin
by
the
emperor
and
all
his
host
on
another
occasion
orlando
encountered
a
puissant
saracen
warrior
and
took
from
him
as
the
prize
of
victory
the
sword
durindana
this
famous
weapon
had
once
belonged
to
the
illustrious
prince
hector
of
troy
it
was
of
the
finest
workmanship
and
of
such
strength
and
temper
that
no
armor
in
the
world
could
stand
against
it
a
roland
for
an
oliver
guerin
de
montglave
held
the
lordship
of
vienne
subject
to
charlemagne
he
had
quarrelled
with
his
sovereign
and
charles
laid
siege
to
his
city
having
ravaged
the
neighboring
country
guerin
was
an
aged
warrior
but
relied
for
his
defence
upon
his
four
sons
and
two
grandsons
who
were
among
the
bravest
knights
of
the
age
after
the
siege
had
continued
two
months
charlemagne
received
tidings
that
marsilius
king
of
spain
had
invaded
france
and
finding
himself
unopposed
was
advancing
rapidly
in
the
southern
provinces
at
this
intelligence
charles
listened
to
the
counsel
of
his
peers
and
consented
to
put
the
quarrel
with
guerin
to
the
decision
of
heaven
by
single
combat
between
two
knights
one
of
each
party
selected
by
lot
the
proposal
was
acceptable
to
guerin
and
his
sons
the
names
of
the
four
together
with
guerin
own
who
would
not
be
excused
and
of
the
two
grandsons
who
claimed
their
lot
being
put
into
a
helmet
oliver
was
drawn
forth
and
to
him
the
youngest
of
the
grandsons
was
assigned
the
honor
and
the
peril
of
the
combat
he
accepted
the
award
with
delight
exulting
in
being
thought
worthy
to
maintain
the
cause
of
his
family
on
charlemagne
side
roland
was
the
designated
champion
and
neither
he
nor
oliver
knew
who
his
antagonist
was
to
be
they
met
on
an
island
in
the
rhone
and
the
warriors
of
both
camps
were
ranged
on
either
shore
spectators
of
the
battle
at
the
first
encounter
both
lances
were
shivered
but
both
riders
kept
their
seats
immovable
they
dismounted
and
drew
their
swords
then
ensued
a
combat
which
seemed
so
equal
that
the
spectators
could
not
form
an
opinion
as
to
the
probable
issue
two
hours
and
more
the
knights
continued
to
strike
and
parry
to
thrust
and
ward
neither
showing
any
sign
of
weariness
nor
ever
being
taken
at
unawares
at
length
orlando
struck
furiously
upon
shield
burying
durindana
in
its
edge
so
deeply
that
he
could
not
draw
it
back
and
oliver
almost
at
the
same
moment
thrust
so
vigorously
upon
orlando
breastplate
that
his
sword
snapped
off
at
the
handle
thus
were
the
two
warriors
left
weaponless
scarcely
pausing
a
moment
they
rushed
upon
one
another
each
striving
to
throw
his
adversary
to
the
ground
and
failing
in
that
each
snatched
at
the
other
helmet
to
tear
it
away
both
succeeded
and
at
the
same
moment
they
stood
face
to
face
and
roland
recognized
oliver
and
oliver
roland
for
a
moment
they
stood
still
and
the
next
with
open
arms
rushed
into
one
another
embrace
i
am
conquered
said
orlando
i
yield
me
said
oliver
the
people
on
the
shore
knew
not
what
to
make
of
all
this
presently
they
saw
the
two
late
antagonists
standing
hand
in
hand
and
it
was
evident
the
battle
was
at
an
end
the
knights
crowded
round
them
and
with
one
voice
hailed
them
as
equals
in
glory
if
there
were
any
who
felt
disposed
to
murmur
that
the
battle
was
left
undecided
they
were
silenced
by
the
voice
of
ogier
the
dane
who
proclaimed
aloud
that
all
had
been
done
that
honor
required
and
declared
that
he
would
maintain
that
award
against
all
gainsayers
the
quarrel
with
guerin
and
his
sons
being
left
undecided
a
truce
was
made
for
four
days
and
in
that
time
by
the
efforts
of
duke
namo
on
the
one
side
and
of
oliver
on
the
other
a
reconciliation
was
effected
charlemagne
accompanied
by
guerin
and
his
valiant
family
marched
to
meet
marsilius
who
hastened
to
retreat
across
the
frontier
rinaldo
rinaldo
was
one
of
the
four
sons
of
aymon
who
married
aya
the
sister
of
charlemagne
thus
rinaldo
was
nephew
to
charlemagne
and
cousin
of
orlando
when
rinaldo
had
grown
old
enough
to
assume
arms
orlando
had
won
for
himself
an
illustrious
name
by
his
exploits
against
the
saracens
whom
charlemagne
and
his
brave
knights
had
driven
out
of
france
orlando
fame
excited
a
noble
emulation
in
rinaldo
eager
to
go
in
pursuit
of
glory
he
wandered
in
the
country
near
paris
and
one
day
saw
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
a
superb
horse
fully
equipped
and
loaded
with
a
complete
suit
of
armor
rinaldo
clothed
himself
in
the
armor
and
mounted
the
horse
but
took
not
the
sword
on
the
day
when
with
his
brothers
he
had
received
the
honor
of
knighthood
from
the
emperor
he
had
sworn
never
to
bind
a
sword
to
his
side
till
he
had
wrested
one
from
some
famous
knight
rinaldo
took
his
way
to
the
forest
of
arden
celebrated
for
so
many
adventures
hardly
had
he
entered
it
when
he
met
an
old
man
bending
under
the
weight
of
years
and
learned
from
him
that
the
forest
was
infested
with
a
wild
horse
untamable
that
broke
and
overturned
everything
that
opposed
his
career
to
attack
him
he
said
or
even
to
meet
him
was
certain
death
rinaldo
far
from
being
alarmed
showed
the
most
eager
desire
to
combat
the
animal
this
was
the
horse
bayard
afterward
so
famous
he
had
formerly
belonged
to
amadis
of
gaul
after
the
death
of
that
hero
he
had
been
held
under
enchantment
by
the
power
of
a
magician
who
predicted
that
when
the
time
came
to
break
the
spell
he
should
be
subdued
by
a
knight
of
the
lineage
of
amadis
and
not
less
brave
than
he
to
win
this
wonderful
horse
it
was
necessary
to
conquer
him
by
force
or
skill
for
from
the
moment
when
he
should
be
thrown
down
he
would
become
docile
and
manageable
his
habitual
resort
was
a
cave
on
the
borders
of
the
forest
but
woe
be
to
any
one
who
should
approach
him
unless
gifted
with
strength
and
courage
more
than
mortal
having
told
this
the
old
man
departed
he
was
not
in
fact
an
old
man
but
malagigi
the
enchanter
cousin
of
rinaldo
who
to
favor
the
enterprises
of
the
young
knight
had
procured
for
him
the
horse
and
armor
which
he
so
opportunely
found
and
now
put
him
in
the
way
to
acquire
a
horse
unequalled
in
the
world
rinaldo
plunged
into
the
forest
and
spent
many
days
in
seeking
bayard
but
found
no
traces
of
him
one
day
he
encountered
a
saracen
knight
with
whom
he
made
acquaintance
as
often
happened
to
knights
by
first
meeting
him
in
combat
this
knight
whose
name
was
isolier
was
also
in
quest
of
bayard
rinaldo
succeeded
in
the
encounter
and
so
severe
was
the
shock
that
isolier
was
a
long
time
insensible
when
he
revived
and
was
about
to
resume
the
contest
a
peasant
who
passed
by
it
was
malagigi
interrupted
them
with
the
news
that
the
terrible
horse
was
near
at
hand
advising
them
to
unite
their
powers
to
subdue
him
for
it
would
require
all
their
ability
rinaldo
and
isolier
now
become
friends
proceeded
together
to
the
attack
of
the
horse
they
found
bayard
and
stood
a
long
time
concealed
by
the
wood
admiring
his
strength
and
beauty
a
bright
bay
in
color
whence
he
was
called
bayard
with
a
silver
star
in
his
forehead
and
his
hind
feet
white
his
body
slender
his
head
delicate
his
ample
chest
filled
out
with
swelling
muscles
his
shoulders
broad
and
full
his
legs
straight
and
sinewy
his
thick
mane
falling
over
his
arching
neck
he
came
rushing
through
the
forest
regardless
of
rocks
bushes
or
trees
rending
everything
that
opposed
his
way
and
neighing
defiance
he
first
descried
isolier
and
rushed
upon
him
the
knight
received
him
with
lance
in
rest
but
the
fierce
animal
broke
the
spear
and
his
course
was
not
delayed
by
it
for
an
instant
the
spaniard
adroitly
stepped
aside
and
gave
way
to
the
rushing
tempest
bayard
checked
his
career
and
turned
again
upon
the
knight
who
had
already
drawn
his
sword
he
drew
his
sword
for
he
had
no
hope
of
taming
the
horse
that
he
was
satisfied
was
impossible
bayard
rushed
upon
him
fiercely
rearing
now
on
this
side
now
on
that
the
knight
struck
him
with
his
sword
where
the
white
star
adorned
his
forehead
but
struck
in
vain
and
felt
ashamed
thinking
that
he
had
struck
feebly
for
he
did
not
know
that
the
skin
of
that
horse
was
so
tough
that
the
keenest
sword
could
make
no
impression
upon
it
whistling
fell
the
sword
once
more
and
struck
with
greater
force
and
the
fierce
horse
felt
it
and
drooped
his
head
under
the
blow
but
the
next
moment
turned
upon
his
foe
with
such
a
buffet
that
the
pagan
fell
stunned
and
lifeless
to
the
earth
rinaldo
who
saw
isolier
fall
and
thought
that
his
life
was
reft
darted
towards
the
horse
and
with
his
fist
gave
him
such
a
blow
on
the
jaws
that
the
blood
tinged
his
mouth
with
vermilion
quicker
than
an
arrow
leaves
the
bow
the
horse
turned
upon
him
and
tried
to
seize
his
arm
with
his
teeth
the
knight
stepped
back
and
then
repeating
his
blow
struck
him
on
the
forehead
bayard
turned
and
kicked
with
both
his
feet
with
a
force
that
would
have
shattered
a
mountain
rinaldo
was
on
his
guard
and
evaded
his
attacks
whether
made
with
head
or
heels
he
kept
at
his
side
avoiding
both
but
making
a
false
step
he
at
last
received
a
terrible
blow
from
the
horse
foot
and
at
the
shock
almost
fainted
away
a
second
such
blow
would
have
killed
him
but
the
horse
kicked
at
random
and
a
second
blow
did
not
reach
rinaldo
who
in
a
moment
recovered
himself
thus
the
contest
continued
until
by
chance
bayard
foot
got
caught
between
the
branches
of
an
oak
rinaldo
seized
it
and
putting
forth
all
his
strength
and
address
threw
him
on
the
ground
no
sooner
had
bayard
touched
the
ground
than
all
his
rage
subsided
no
longer
an
object
of
terror
he
became
gentle
and
quiet
yet
with
dignity
in
his
mildness
the
paladin
patted
his
neck
stroked
his
breast
and
smoothed
his
mane
while
the
animal
neighed
and
showed
delight
to
be
caressed
by
his
master
rinaldo
seeing
him
now
completely
subdued
took
the
saddle
and
trappings
from
the
other
horse
and
adorned
bayard
with
the
spoils
rinaldo
became
one
of
the
most
illustrious
knights
of
charlemagne
court
indeed
the
most
illustrious
if
we
except
orlando
yet
he
was
not
always
so
obedient
to
the
commands
as
he
should
have
been
and
every
fault
he
committed
was
sure
to
be
aggravated
by
the
malice
of
gan
duke
of
maganza
the
treacherous
enemy
of
rinaldo
and
all
his
house
at
one
time
rinaldo
had
incurred
the
severe
displeasure
of
charlemagne
and
been
banished
from
court
seeing
no
chance
of
being
ever
restored
to
favor
he
went
to
spain
and
entered
into
the
service
of
the
saracen
king
ivo
his
brothers
alardo
ricardo
and
ricciardetto
accompanied
him
and
all
four
served
the
king
so
faithfully
that
they
rose
to
high
favor
with
him
the
king
gave
them
land
in
the
mountains
on
the
frontiers
of
france
and
spain
and
subjected
all
the
country
round
to
authority
there
was
plenty
of
marble
in
the
mountains
the
king
furnished
workmen
and
they
built
a
castle
for
rinaldo
surrounded
with
high
walls
so
as
to
be
almost
impregnable
built
of
white
stone
and
placed
on
the
brow
of
a
marble
promontory
the
castle
shone
like
a
star
and
rinaldo
gave
it
the
name
of
montalban
here
he
assembled
his
friends
many
of
whom
were
banished
men
like
himself
and
the
country
people
furnished
them
with
provisions
in
return
for
the
protection
the
castle
afforded
yet
some
of
rinaldo
men
were
lawless
and
sometimes
the
supplies
were
not
furnished
in
sufficient
abundance
so
that
rinaldo
and
his
garrison
got
a
bad
name
for
taking
by
force
what
they
could
not
obtain
by
gift
and
we
sometimes
find
montalban
spoken
of
as
a
nest
of
freebooters
and
its
defenders
called
a
beggarly
garrison
charlemagne
displeasure
did
not
last
long
and
at
the
time
our
history
commences
rinaldo
and
his
brothers
were
completely
restored
to
the
favor
of
the
emperor
and
none
of
his
cavaliers
served
him
with
greater
zeal
and
fidelity
than
they
throughout
all
his
wars
with
the
saracens
and
pagans
the
tournament
it
was
the
month
of
may
and
the
feast
of
pentecost
charlemagne
had
ordered
magnificent
festivities
and
summoned
to
them
besides
his
paladins
and
vassals
of
the
crown
all
strangers
christian
or
saracen
then
sojourning
at
paris
among
the
guests
were
king
grandonio
from
spain
and
ferrau
the
saracen
with
eyes
like
an
eagle
orlando
and
rinaldo
the
emperor
nephews
duke
namo
astolpho
of
england
the
handsomest
man
living
malagigi
the
enchanter
and
gano
of
maganza
that
wily
traitor
who
had
the
art
to
make
the
emperor
think
he
loved
him
while
he
plotted
against
him
high
sat
charlemagne
at
the
head
of
his
vassals
and
his
paladins
rejoicing
in
the
thought
of
their
number
and
their
might
while
all
were
sitting
and
hearing
music
and
feasting
when
suddenly
there
came
into
the
hall
four
enormous
giants
having
between
them
a
lady
of
incomparable
beauty
attended
by
a
single
knight
there
were
many
ladies
present
who
had
seemed
beautiful
till
she
made
her
appearance
but
after
that
they
all
seemed
nothing
every
christian
knight
turned
his
eyes
to
her
and
every
pagan
crowded
round
her
while
she
with
a
sweetness
that
might
have
touched
a
heart
of
stone
thus
addressed
the
emperor
lord
the
renown
of
your
worthiness
and
of
the
valor
of
these
your
knights
which
echoes
from
sea
to
sea
encourages
me
to
hope
that
two
pilgrims
who
have
come
from
the
ends
of
the
world
to
behold
you
will
not
have
encountered
their
fatigue
in
vain
and
before
i
show
the
motive
which
has
brought
us
hither
learn
that
this
knight
is
my
brother
uberto
and
that
i
am
his
sister
angelica
fame
has
told
us
of
the
jousting
this
day
appointed
and
so
the
prince
my
brother
has
come
to
prove
his
valor
and
to
say
that
if
any
of
the
knights
here
assembled
choose
to
meet
him
in
the
joust
he
will
encounter
them
one
by
one
at
the
stair
of
merlin
by
the
fountain
of
the
pine
and
his
conditions
are
these
no
knight
who
chances
to
be
thrown
shall
be
allowed
to
renew
the
combat
but
shall
remain
prisoner
to
my
brother
but
if
my
brother
be
overthrown
he
shall
depart
out
of
the
country
leaving
me
as
the
prize
of
the
conqueror
now
it
must
be
stated
that
this
angelica
and
her
brother
who
called
himself
uberto
but
whose
real
name
was
argalia
were
the
children
of
galafron
king
of
cathay
who
had
sent
them
to
be
the
destruction
of
the
christian
host
for
argalia
was
armed
with
an
enchanted
lance
which
unfailingly
overthrew
everything
it
touched
and
he
was
mounted
on
a
horse
a
creature
of
magic
whose
swiftness
outstripped
the
wind
angelica
possessed
also
a
ring
which
was
a
defence
against
all
enchantments
and
when
put
into
the
mouth
rendered
the
bearer
invisible
thus
argalia
was
expected
to
subdue
and
take
prisoners
whatever
knights
should
dare
to
encounter
him
and
the
charms
of
angelica
were
relied
on
to
entice
the
paladins
to
make
the
fatal
venture
while
her
ring
would
afford
her
easy
means
of
escape
when
angelica
ceased
sneaking
she
knelt
before
the
king
and
awaited
his
answer
and
everybody
gazed
on
her
with
admiration
orlando
especially
felt
irresistibly
drawn
towards
her
so
that
he
trembled
and
changed
countenance
every
knight
in
the
hall
was
infected
with
the
same
feeling
not
excepting
old
duke
namo
and
charlemagne
himself
all
stood
for
a
while
in
silence
lost
in
the
delight
of
looking
at
her
the
fiery
youth
ferrau
could
hardly
restrain
himself
from
seizing
her
from
the
giants
and
carrying
her
away
rinaldo
turned
as
red
as
fire
while
malagigi
who
had
discovered
by
his
art
that
the
stranger
was
not
speaking
truth
muttered
softly
as
he
looked
at
her
exquisite
false
creature
i
will
play
thee
such
a
trick
for
this
as
will
leave
thee
no
cause
to
boast
of
thy
visit
charlemagne
to
detain
her
as
long
as
possible
before
him
delayed
his
assent
till
he
had
asked
her
a
number
of
questions
all
which
she
answered
discreetly
and
then
the
challenge
was
accepted
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
malagigi
consulted
his
book
and
found
out
the
whole
plot
of
the
vile
infidel
king
galafron
as
we
have
explained
it
so
he
determined
to
seek
the
damsel
and
frustrate
her
designs
he
hastened
to
the
appointed
spot
and
there
found
the
prince
and
his
sister
in
a
beautiful
pavilion
where
they
lay
asleep
while
the
four
giants
kept
watch
malagigi
took
his
book
and
cast
a
spell
out
of
it
and
immediately
the
four
giants
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
drawing
his
sword
for
he
was
a
belted
knight
he
softly
approached
the
young
lady
intending
to
despatch
her
at
once
but
seeing
her
look
so
lovely
he
paused
for
a
moment
thinking
there
was
no
need
of
hurry
as
he
believed
his
spell
was
upon
her
and
she
could
not
wake
but
the
ring
which
she
wore
secured
her
from
the
effect
of
the
spell
and
some
slight
noise
or
whatever
else
it
was
caused
her
at
that
moment
to
awake
she
uttered
a
great
cry
and
flew
to
her
brother
and
waked
him
by
the
help
of
her
knowledge
of
enchantment
they
took
and
bound
fast
the
magician
and
seizing
his
book
turned
his
arts
against
himself
then
they
summoned
a
crowd
of
demons
and
bade
them
seize
their
prisoner
and
bear
him
to
king
galafron
at
his
great
city
of
albracca
which
they
did
and
on
his
arrival
he
was
locked
up
in
a
rock
under
the
sea
while
these
things
were
going
on
all
was
uproar
at
paris
since
orlando
insisted
upon
being
the
first
to
try
the
adventure
at
the
stair
of
merlin
this
was
resented
by
the
other
pretenders
to
angelica
and
all
contested
his
right
to
the
precedence
the
tumult
was
stilled
by
the
usual
expedient
of
drawing
lots
and
the
first
prize
was
drawn
by
astolpho
ferrau
the
saracen
had
the
second
and
grandonio
the
third
next
came
berlinghieri
and
otho
then
charles
himself
and
as
his
would
have
it
after
thirty
more
the
indignant
orlando
astolpho
who
drew
the
first
lot
was
handsome
brave
and
rich
but
whether
from
heedlessness
or
want
of
skill
he
was
an
unlucky
jouster
and
very
apt
to
be
thrown
an
accident
which
he
bore
with
perfect
always
ready
to
mount
again
and
try
to
mend
his
fortune
generally
with
no
better
success
astolpho
went
forth
upon
his
adventure
with
great
gayety
of
dress
and
manner
encountered
argalia
and
was
immediately
tilted
out
of
the
saddle
he
railed
at
fortune
to
whom
he
laid
all
the
fault
but
his
painful
feelings
were
somewhat
relieved
by
the
kindness
of
angelica
who
touched
by
his
youth
and
good
looks
granted
him
the
liberty
of
the
pavilion
and
caused
him
to
be
treated
with
all
kindness
and
respect
the
violent
ferrau
had
the
next
chance
in
the
encounter
and
was
thrown
no
less
speedily
than
astolpho
but
he
did
not
so
easily
put
up
with
his
mischance
crying
out
what
are
the
engagements
to
me
he
rushed
with
his
sword
against
argalia
who
being
forced
to
defend
himself
dismounted
and
drew
his
sword
but
got
so
much
the
worse
of
the
fight
that
he
made
a
signal
of
surrender
and
after
some
words
listened
to
a
proposal
of
marriage
from
ferrau
to
his
sister
the
beauty
however
feeling
no
inclination
to
match
with
such
a
rough
and
person
was
so
dismayed
at
the
offer
that
hastily
bidding
her
brother
to
meet
her
in
the
forest
of
arden
she
vanished
from
the
sight
of
both
by
means
of
the
enchanted
ring
argalia
seeing
this
took
to
his
horse
of
swiftness
and
dashed
away
in
the
same
direction
ferrau
pursued
him
and
astolpho
thus
left
to
himself
took
possession
of
the
enchanted
lance
in
place
of
his
own
which
was
broken
not
knowing
the
treasure
he
possessed
in
it
and
returned
to
the
tournament
charlemagne
finding
the
lady
and
her
brother
gone
ordered
the
jousting
to
proceed
as
at
first
intended
in
which
astolpho
by
aid
of
the
enchanted
lance
unhorsed
all
comers
against
him
equally
to
their
astonishment
and
his
own
the
paladin
rinaldo
on
learning
the
issue
of
the
combat
of
ferrau
and
the
stranger
galloped
after
the
fair
fugitive
in
an
agony
of
love
and
impatience
orlando
perceiving
his
disappearance
pushed
forth
in
like
manner
and
at
length
all
three
are
in
the
forest
of
arden
hunting
about
for
her
who
is
invisible
now
in
this
forest
there
were
two
fountains
the
one
constructed
by
the
sage
merlin
who
designed
it
for
tristram
and
the
fair
isoude
footnote
see
their
story
in
king
arthur
and
his
knights
for
such
was
the
virtue
of
this
fountain
that
a
draught
of
its
waters
produced
on
oblivion
of
the
love
which
the
drinker
might
feel
and
even
produced
aversion
for
the
object
formerly
beloved
the
other
fountain
was
endowed
with
exactly
opposite
qualities
and
a
draught
of
it
inspired
love
for
the
first
living
object
that
was
seen
after
tasting
it
rinaldo
happened
to
come
to
the
first
mentioned
fountain
and
being
flushed
with
heat
dismounted
and
quenched
in
one
draught
both
his
thirst
and
his
passion
so
far
from
loving
angelica
as
before
he
hated
her
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
became
disgusted
with
the
search
he
was
upon
and
feeling
fatigued
with
his
ride
finding
a
sheltered
and
flowery
nook
laid
himself
down
and
fell
asleep
shortly
after
came
angelica
but
approaching
in
a
different
direction
she
espied
the
other
fountain
and
there
quenched
her
thirst
then
resuming
her
way
she
came
upon
the
sleeping
rinaldo
love
instantly
seized
her
and
she
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
the
meadow
round
was
all
full
of
lilies
of
the
valley
and
wild
roses
angelica
not
knowing
what
to
do
at
length
plucked
a
handful
of
these
and
dropped
them
one
by
one
on
the
face
of
the
sleeper
he
woke
up
and
seeing
who
it
was
received
her
salutations
with
averted
countenance
remounted
his
horse
and
galloped
away
in
vain
the
beautiful
creature
followed
and
called
after
him
in
vain
asked
him
what
she
had
done
to
be
so
despised
rinaldo
disappeared
leaving
her
in
despair
and
she
returned
in
tears
to
the
spot
where
she
had
found
him
sleeping
there
in
her
turn
she
herself
lay
down
pressing
the
spot
of
earth
on
which
he
had
lain
and
out
of
fatigue
and
sorrow
fell
asleep
as
angelica
thus
lay
fortune
conducted
orlando
to
the
same
place
the
attitude
in
which
she
was
sleeping
was
so
lovely
that
it
is
not
to
be
conceived
much
less
expressed
orlando
stood
gazing
like
a
man
who
had
been
transported
to
another
sphere
am
i
on
earth
he
exclaimed
or
am
i
in
paradise
surely
it
is
i
that
sleep
and
this
is
my
dream
but
his
dream
was
proved
to
be
none
in
a
manner
which
he
little
desired
ferrau
who
had
slain
argalia
came
up
raging
with
jealousy
and
a
combat
ensued
which
awoke
the
sleeper
terrified
at
what
she
beheld
she
rushed
to
her
palfrey
and
while
the
fighters
were
occupied
with
one
another
fled
away
through
the
forest
the
champions
continued
their
fight
till
they
were
interrupted
by
a
messenger
who
brought
word
to
ferrau
that
king
marsilius
his
sovereign
was
in
pressing
need
of
his
assistance
and
conjured
him
to
return
to
spain
ferrau
upon
this
proposed
to
suspend
the
combat
to
which
orlando
eager
to
pursue
angelica
agreed
ferrau
on
the
other
hand
departed
with
the
messenger
to
spain
orlando
quest
for
the
fair
fugitive
was
all
in
vain
aided
by
the
powers
of
magic
she
made
a
speedy
return
to
her
own
country
but
the
thought
of
rinaldo
could
not
be
banished
from
her
mind
and
she
determined
to
set
malagigi
at
liberty
and
to
employ
him
to
win
rinaldo
if
possible
to
make
her
a
return
of
affection
she
accordingly
freed
him
from
his
dungeon
unlocking
his
fetters
with
her
own
hands
and
restored
him
his
book
promising
him
ample
honors
and
rewards
on
condition
of
his
bringing
rinaldo
to
her
feet
malagigi
accordingly
with
the
aid
of
his
book
called
up
a
demon
mounted
him
and
departed
arrived
at
his
destination
he
inveigled
rinaldo
into
an
enchanted
bark
which
conveyed
him
without
any
visible
pilot
to
an
island
where
stood
an
edifice
called
joyous
castle
the
whole
island
was
a
garden
on
the
western
side
close
to
the
sea
was
the
palace
built
of
marble
so
clear
and
polished
that
it
reflected
the
landscape
about
it
rinaldo
leapt
ashore
and
soon
met
a
lady
who
invited
him
to
enter
the
house
was
as
beautiful
within
as
without
full
of
rooms
adorned
with
azure
and
gold
and
with
noble
paintings
the
lady
led
the
knight
into
an
apartment
painted
with
stories
and
opening
to
the
garden
through
pillars
of
crystal
with
golden
capitals
here
he
found
a
bevy
of
ladies
three
of
whom
were
singing
in
concert
while
another
played
on
an
instrument
of
exquisite
accord
and
the
rest
danced
round
about
them
when
the
ladies
beheld
him
coming
they
turned
the
dance
into
a
circuit
round
him
and
then
one
of
them
in
the
sweetest
manner
said
sir
knight
the
tables
are
set
and
the
hour
for
the
banquet
is
come
and
with
these
words
still
dancing
they
drew
him
across
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
apartment
to
a
table
that
was
spread
with
cloth
of
gold
and
fine
linen
under
a
bower
of
damask
roses
by
the
side
of
a
fountain
four
ladies
were
already
seated
there
who
rose
and
placed
rinaldo
at
their
head
in
a
chair
set
with
pearls
and
truly
indeed
was
he
astonished
a
repast
ensued
consisting
of
viands
the
most
delicate
and
wines
as
fragrant
as
they
were
fine
drunk
out
of
jewelled
cups
and
when
it
drew
towards
its
conclusion
harps
and
lutes
were
heard
in
the
distance
and
one
of
the
ladies
said
in
the
knight
ear
this
house
and
all
that
you
see
in
it
are
yours
for
you
alone
was
it
built
and
the
builder
is
a
queen
happy
indeed
must
you
think
yourself
for
she
loves
you
and
she
is
the
greatest
beauty
in
the
world
her
name
is
angelica
the
moment
rinaldo
heard
the
name
he
so
detested
he
started
up
with
a
changed
countenance
and
in
spite
of
all
that
the
lady
could
say
broke
off
across
the
garden
and
never
ceased
hastening
till
he
reached
the
place
where
he
landed
the
bark
was
still
on
the
shore
he
sprang
into
it
and
pushed
off
though
he
saw
nobody
in
it
but
himself
it
was
in
vain
for
him
to
try
to
control
its
movements
for
it
dashed
on
as
if
in
fury
till
it
reached
a
distant
shore
covered
with
a
gloomy
forest
here
rinaldo
surrounded
by
enchantments
of
a
very
different
sort
from
those
which
he
had
lately
resisted
was
entrapped
into
a
pit
the
pit
belonged
to
a
castle
called
altaripa
which
was
hung
with
human
heads
and
painted
red
with
blood
as
the
paladin
was
viewing
the
scene
with
amazement
a
hideous
old
woman
made
her
appearance
at
the
edge
of
the
pit
and
told
him
that
he
was
destined
to
be
thrown
to
a
monster
who
was
only
kept
from
devastating
the
whole
country
by
being
supplied
with
living
human
flesh
rinaldo
said
be
it
so
let
me
but
remain
armed
as
i
am
and
i
fear
nothing
the
old
woman
laughed
in
derision
rinaldo
remained
in
the
pit
all
night
and
the
next
morning
was
taken
to
the
place
where
the
monster
had
his
den
it
was
a
court
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
rinaldo
was
shut
in
with
the
beast
and
a
terrible
combat
ensued
rinaldo
was
unable
to
make
any
impression
on
the
scales
of
the
monster
while
he
on
the
contrary
with
his
dreadful
claws
tore
away
plate
and
mail
from
the
paladin
rinaldo
began
to
think
his
last
hour
was
come
and
cast
his
eyes
around
and
above
to
see
if
there
was
any
means
of
escape
he
perceived
a
beam
projecting
from
the
wall
at
the
height
of
some
ten
feet
and
taking
a
leap
almost
miraculous
he
succeeded
in
reaching
it
and
in
flinging
himself
up
across
it
here
he
sat
for
hours
the
hideous
brute
continually
trying
to
reach
him
all
at
once
he
heard
the
sound
of
something
coming
through
the
air
like
a
bird
and
suddenly
angelica
herself
alighted
on
the
end
of
the
beam
she
held
something
in
her
hand
towards
him
and
spoke
to
him
in
a
loving
voice
but
the
moment
rinaldo
saw
her
he
commanded
her
to
go
away
refused
all
her
offers
of
assistance
and
at
length
declared
that
if
she
did
not
leave
him
he
would
cast
himself
down
to
the
monster
and
meet
his
fate
angelica
saying
she
would
lose
her
life
rather
than
displease
him
departed
but
first
she
threw
to
the
monster
a
cake
of
wax
she
had
prepared
and
spread
around
him
a
rope
knotted
with
nooses
the
beast
took
the
bait
and
finding
his
teeth
glued
together
by
the
wax
vented
his
fury
in
bounds
and
leaps
and
soon
getting
entangled
in
the
nooses
drew
them
tight
by
his
struggles
so
that
he
could
scarcely
move
a
limb
rinaldo
watching
his
chance
leapt
down
upon
his
back
seized
him
round
the
neck
and
throttled
him
not
relaxing
his
gripe
till
the
beast
fell
dead
another
difficulty
remained
to
be
overcome
the
walls
were
of
immense
height
and
the
only
opening
in
them
was
a
grated
window
of
such
strength
that
he
could
not
break
the
bars
in
his
distress
rinaldo
found
a
file
which
angelica
had
left
on
the
ground
and
with
the
help
of
this
effected
his
deliverance
what
further
adventures
he
met
with
will
be
told
in
another
chapter
the
siege
of
albracca
at
the
very
time
when
charlemagne
was
holding
his
plenary
court
and
his
great
tournament
his
kingdom
was
invaded
by
a
mighty
monarch
who
was
moreover
so
valiant
and
strong
in
battle
that
no
one
could
stand
against
him
he
was
named
gradasso
and
his
kingdom
was
called
sericane
now
as
it
often
happens
to
the
greatest
and
the
richest
to
long
for
what
they
can
not
have
and
thus
to
lose
what
they
already
possess
this
king
could
not
rest
content
without
durindana
the
sword
of
orlando
and
bayard
the
horse
of
rinaldo
to
obtain
these
he
determined
to
war
upon
france
and
for
this
purpose
put
in
array
a
mighty
army
he
took
his
way
through
spain
and
after
defeating
marsilius
the
king
of
that
country
in
several
battles
was
rapidly
advancing
on
france
charlemagne
though
marsilius
was
a
saracen
and
had
been
his
enemy
yet
felt
it
needful
to
succor
him
in
this
extremity
from
a
consideration
of
common
danger
and
with
the
consent
of
his
peers
despatched
rinaldo
with
a
strong
body
of
soldiers
against
gradasso
there
was
much
fighting
with
doubtful
results
and
gradasso
was
steadily
advancing
into
france
but
impatient
to
achieve
his
objects
he
challenged
rinaldo
to
single
combat
to
be
fought
on
foot
and
upon
these
conditions
if
rinaldo
conquered
gradasso
agreed
to
give
up
all
his
prisoners
and
return
to
his
own
country
but
if
gradasso
won
the
day
he
was
to
have
bayard
the
challenge
was
accepted
and
would
have
been
fought
had
it
not
been
for
the
arts
of
malagigi
who
just
then
returned
from
angelica
kingdom
with
set
purpose
to
win
rinaldo
to
look
with
favor
upon
the
fair
princess
who
was
dying
for
love
of
him
malagigi
drew
rinaldo
away
from
the
army
by
putting
on
the
semblance
of
gradasso
and
after
a
short
contest
pretending
to
fly
before
him
by
which
means
rinaldo
was
induced
to
follow
him
into
a
boat
in
which
he
was
borne
away
and
entangled
in
various
adventures
as
we
have
already
related
the
army
left
under
the
command
of
ricciardetto
brother
was
soon
joined
by
charlemagne
and
all
his
peerage
but
experienced
a
disastrous
rout
and
the
emperor
and
many
of
his
paladins
were
taken
prisoners
gradasso
however
did
not
abuse
his
victory
he
took
charles
by
the
hand
seated
him
by
his
side
and
told
him
he
warred
only
for
honor
he
renounced
all
conquests
on
condition
that
the
emperor
should
deliver
to
him
bayard
and
durindana
both
of
them
the
property
of
his
vassals
the
former
of
which
as
he
maintained
was
already
forfeited
to
him
by
failure
to
meet
him
as
agreed
to
these
terms
charlemagne
readily
acceded
bayard
after
the
departure
of
his
master
had
been
taken
in
charge
by
ricciardetto
and
sent
back
to
paris
where
astolpho
was
in
command
in
the
absence
of
charlemagne
astolpho
received
with
great
indignation
the
message
despatched
for
bayard
and
replied
by
a
herald
that
he
would
not
surrender
the
horse
of
his
kinsman
rinaldo
without
a
contest
if
gradasso
wanted
the
steed
he
might
come
and
take
him
and
that
he
astolpho
was
ready
to
meet
him
in
the
field
gradasso
was
only
amused
at
this
answer
for
astolpho
fame
as
a
successful
warrior
was
not
high
and
gradasso
willingly
renewed
with
him
the
bargain
which
he
had
made
with
rinaldo
on
these
conditions
the
battle
was
fought
the
enchanted
lance
in
the
hands
of
astolpho
performed
a
new
wonder
and
gradasso
the
terrible
gradasso
was
unhorsed
he
kept
his
word
set
free
his
prisoners
and
put
his
army
on
the
march
to
return
to
his
own
country
renewing
his
oath
however
not
to
rest
till
he
had
taken
from
rinaldo
his
horse
and
from
orlando
his
sword
or
lost
his
life
in
the
attempt
charlemagne
full
of
gratitude
to
astolpho
would
have
kept
him
near
his
person
and
loaded
him
with
honors
but
astolpho
preferred
to
seek
rinaldo
with
the
view
of
restoring
to
him
his
horse
and
departed
from
paris
with
that
design
our
story
now
returns
to
orlando
whom
we
left
fascinated
with
the
sight
of
the
sleeping
beauty
who
however
escaped
him
while
engaged
in
the
combat
with
ferrau
having
long
sought
her
in
vain
through
the
recesses
of
the
wood
he
resolved
to
follow
her
to
her
father
court
leaving
therefore
the
camp
of
charlemagne
he
travelled
long
in
the
direction
of
the
east
making
inquiry
everywhere
if
perchance
he
might
get
tidings
of
the
fugitive
after
many
adventures
he
arrived
one
day
at
a
place
where
many
roads
crossed
and
meeting
there
a
courier
he
asked
him
for
news
the
courier
replied
that
he
had
been
despatched
by
angelica
to
solicit
the
aid
of
sacripant
king
of
circassia
in
favor
of
her
father
galafron
who
was
besieged
in
his
city
albracca
by
agrican
king
of
tartary
this
agrican
had
been
an
unsuccessful
suitor
to
the
damsel
whom
he
now
pursued
with
arms
orlando
thus
learned
that
he
was
within
a
day
journey
of
albracca
and
feeling
now
secure
of
angelica
he
proceeded
with
all
speed
to
her
city
thus
journeying
he
arrived
at
a
bridge
under
which
flowed
a
foaming
river
here
a
damsel
met
him
with
a
goblet
and
informed
him
that
it
was
the
usage
of
this
bridge
to
present
the
traveller
with
a
cup
orlando
accepted
the
offered
cup
and
drank
its
contents
he
had
no
sooner
done
so
than
his
brain
reeled
and
he
became
unconscious
of
the
object
of
his
journey
and
of
everything
else
under
the
influence
of
this
fascination
he
followed
the
damsel
into
a
magnificent
and
marvellous
palace
here
he
found
himself
in
company
with
many
knights
unknown
to
him
and
to
each
other
though
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
cup
of
oblivion
of
which
they
all
had
partaken
they
would
have
found
themselves
brothers
in
arms
astolpho
proceeding
on
his
way
to
seek
rinaldo
splendidly
dressed
and
equipped
as
was
his
wont
arrived
in
circassia
and
found
there
a
great
army
encamped
under
the
command
of
sacripant
the
king
of
that
country
who
was
leading
it
to
the
defence
of
galafron
the
father
of
angelica
sacripant
much
struck
by
the
appearance
of
astolpho
and
his
horse
accosted
him
courteously
and
tried
to
enlist
him
in
his
service
but
astolpho
proud
of
his
late
victories
scornfully
declined
his
offers
and
pursued
his
way
king
sacripant
was
too
much
attracted
by
his
appearance
to
part
with
him
so
easily
and
having
laid
aside
his
kingly
ornaments
set
out
in
pursuit
of
him
astolpho
next
day
encountered
on
his
way
a
stranger
knight
named
sir
florismart
lord
of
the
sylvan
tower
one
of
the
bravest
and
best
of
knights
having
as
his
guide
a
damsel
young
fair
and
virtuous
to
whom
he
was
tenderly
attached
whose
name
was
flordelis
astolpho
as
he
approached
defied
the
knight
bidding
him
yield
the
lady
or
prepare
to
maintain
his
right
by
arms
florismart
accepted
the
contest
and
the
knights
encountered
florismart
was
unhorsed
and
his
steed
fell
dead
while
bayard
sustained
no
injury
by
the
shock
florismart
was
so
overwhelmed
with
despair
at
his
own
disgrace
and
the
sight
of
the
damsel
distress
that
he
drew
his
sword
and
was
about
to
plunge
it
into
his
own
bosom
but
astolpho
held
his
hand
told
him
that
he
contended
only
for
glory
and
was
contented
to
leave
him
the
lady
while
florismart
and
flordelis
were
vowing
eternal
gratitude
king
sacripant
arrived
and
coveting
the
damsel
of
the
one
champion
as
much
as
the
horse
and
arms
of
the
other
defied
them
to
the
joust
astolpho
met
the
challenger
whom
he
instantly
overthrew
and
presented
his
courser
to
florismart
leaving
the
king
to
return
to
his
army
on
foot
the
friends
pursued
their
route
and
ere
long
flordelis
discovered
by
signs
which
were
known
to
her
that
they
were
approaching
the
waters
of
oblivion
and
advised
them
to
turn
back
or
to
change
their
course
this
the
knights
would
not
hear
of
and
continuing
their
march
they
soon
arrived
at
the
bridge
where
orlando
had
been
taken
prisoner
the
damsel
of
the
bridge
appeared
as
before
with
the
enchanted
cup
but
astolpho
forewarned
rejected
it
with
scorn
she
dashed
it
to
the
ground
and
a
fire
blazed
up
which
rendered
the
bridge
unapproachable
at
the
same
moment
the
two
knights
were
assailed
by
sundry
warriors
known
and
unknown
who
having
no
recollection
of
anything
joined
blindly
in
defence
of
their
among
these
was
orlando
at
sight
of
whom
astolpho
with
all
his
confidence
not
daring
to
encounter
him
turned
and
fled
owing
his
escape
to
the
strength
and
fleetness
of
bayard
florismart
meanwhile
overlaid
by
fearful
odds
was
compelled
to
yield
to
necessity
and
comply
with
the
usage
of
the
fairy
he
drank
of
the
cup
and
remained
prisoner
with
the
rest
flordelis
deprived
of
her
two
friends
retired
from
the
scene
and
devoted
herself
to
untiring
efforts
to
effect
her
lover
deliverance
astolpho
pursued
his
way
to
albracca
which
agrican
was
about
to
besiege
he
was
kindly
welcomed
by
angelica
and
enrolled
among
her
defenders
impatient
to
distinguish
himself
he
one
night
sallied
forth
alone
arrived
in
agrican
camp
and
unhorsed
his
warriors
right
and
left
by
means
of
the
enchanted
lance
but
he
was
soon
surrounded
and
overmatched
and
made
prisoner
to
agrican
relief
was
however
at
hand
for
as
the
citizens
and
soldiers
were
one
day
leaning
over
their
walls
they
descried
a
cloud
of
dust
from
which
horsemen
were
seen
to
prick
forth
as
it
rolled
on
towards
the
camp
of
the
besiegers
this
turned
out
to
be
the
army
of
sacripant
which
immediately
attacked
that
of
agrican
with
the
view
of
cutting
a
passage
through
his
camp
to
the
besieged
city
but
agrican
mounted
upon
bayard
taken
from
astolpho
but
not
armed
with
the
lance
of
gold
the
virtues
of
which
were
unknown
to
him
performed
wonders
and
rallied
his
scattered
troops
which
had
given
way
to
the
sudden
and
unexpected
assault
sacripant
on
the
other
hand
encouraged
his
men
by
the
most
desperate
acts
of
valor
having
as
an
additional
incentive
to
his
courage
the
sight
of
angelica
who
showed
herself
upon
the
city
walls
there
she
witnessed
a
single
combat
between
the
two
leaders
agrican
and
sacripant
in
this
at
length
her
defender
appeared
to
be
overmatched
when
the
circassians
broke
the
ring
and
separated
the
combatants
who
were
borne
asunder
in
the
rush
sacripant
severely
wounded
profited
by
the
confusion
and
escaped
into
albracca
where
he
was
kindly
received
and
carefully
tended
by
angelica
the
battle
continuing
the
circassians
were
at
last
put
to
flight
and
being
intercepted
between
the
enemy
lines
and
the
town
sought
for
refuge
under
the
walls
angelica
ordered
the
drawbridge
to
be
let
down
and
the
gates
thrown
open
to
the
fugitives
with
these
agrican
not
distinguished
in
the
crowd
entered
the
place
driving
both
circassians
and
cathayans
before
him
and
the
portcullis
being
dropped
he
was
shut
in
for
a
time
the
terror
which
he
inspired
put
to
flight
all
opposers
but
when
at
last
it
came
to
be
known
that
few
or
none
of
his
followers
had
effected
an
entrance
with
him
the
fugitives
rallied
and
surrounded
him
on
all
sides
while
he
was
thus
apparently
reduced
to
the
last
extremities
he
was
saved
by
the
very
circumstance
which
threatened
him
with
destruction
the
soldiers
of
angelica
closing
upon
him
from
all
sides
deserted
their
defences
and
his
own
besieging
army
entered
the
city
in
a
part
where
the
wall
was
broken
down
in
this
way
was
agrican
rescued
the
city
taken
and
the
inhabitants
put
to
the
sword
angelica
however
with
some
of
the
knights
who
were
her
defenders
among
whom
was
sacripant
saved
herself
in
the
citadel
which
was
planted
upon
a
rock
the
fortress
was
impregnable
but
it
was
scantily
victualled
and
ill
provided
with
other
necessaries
under
these
circumstances
angelica
announced
to
those
blockaded
with
her
in
the
citadel
her
intention
to
go
in
quest
of
assistance
and
having
plighted
her
promise
of
a
speedy
return
she
set
out
with
the
enchanted
ring
upon
her
finger
mounted
upon
her
palfrey
the
damsel
passed
through
the
enemy
lines
and
by
sunrise
was
many
miles
clear
of
their
encampment
it
so
happened
that
her
road
led
her
near
the
fatal
bridge
of
oblivion
and
as
she
approached
it
she
met
a
damsel
weeping
bitterly
it
was
flordelis
whose
lover
florismart
as
we
have
related
had
met
the
fate
of
orlando
and
many
more
and
fallen
a
victim
to
the
enchantress
of
the
cup
she
related
her
adventures
to
angelica
and
conjured
her
to
lend
what
aid
she
might
to
rescue
her
lord
and
his
companions
angelica
accordingly
watching
her
opportunity
and
aided
by
her
ring
slipped
into
the
castle
unseen
when
the
door
was
opened
to
admit
a
new
victim
here
she
speedily
disenchanted
orlando
and
the
rest
by
a
touch
of
her
talisman
but
florismart
was
not
there
he
had
been
given
up
to
falerina
a
more
powerful
enchantress
and
was
still
in
durance
angelica
conjured
the
rescued
captives
to
assist
her
in
the
recovery
of
her
kingdom
and
all
departed
together
for
albracca
the
arrival
of
orlando
with
his
companions
nine
in
all
and
among
the
bravest
knights
of
france
changed
at
once
the
fortunes
of
the
war
wherever
the
great
paladin
came
pennon
and
standard
fell
before
him
agrican
in
vain
attempted
to
rally
his
troops
orlando
kept
constantly
in
his
front
forcing
him
to
attend
to
nobody
else
the
tartar
king
at
length
bethought
him
of
a
stratagem
he
turned
his
horse
and
made
a
show
of
flying
in
despair
orlando
dashed
after
him
as
he
desired
and
agrican
fled
till
he
reached
a
green
place
in
a
wood
where
there
was
a
fountain
the
place
was
beautiful
and
the
tartar
dismounted
to
refresh
himself
at
the
fountain
but
without
taking
off
his
helmet
or
laying
aside
any
of
his
armor
orlando
was
quickly
at
his
back
crying
out
so
bold
and
yet
a
fugitive
how
could
you
fly
from
a
single
arm
and
think
to
escape
the
tartar
king
had
leaped
on
his
saddle
the
moment
he
saw
his
enemy
and
when
the
paladin
had
done
speaking
he
said
in
a
mild
voice
without
doubt
you
are
the
best
knight
i
ever
encountered
and
fain
would
i
leave
you
untouched
for
your
own
sake
if
you
would
cease
to
hinder
me
from
rallying
my
people
i
pretended
to
fly
in
order
to
bring
you
out
of
the
field
if
you
insist
upon
fighting
i
must
needs
fight
and
slay
you
but
i
call
the
sun
in
the
heavens
to
witness
i
would
rather
not
i
should
be
very
sorry
for
your
death
the
count
orlando
felt
pity
for
so
much
gallantry
and
he
said
the
nobler
you
show
yourself
the
more
it
grieves
me
to
think
that
in
dying
without
a
knowledge
of
the
true
faith
you
will
be
lost
in
the
other
world
let
me
advise
you
to
save
body
and
soul
at
once
receive
baptism
and
go
your
way
in
peace
agrican
replied
i
suspect
you
to
be
the
paladin
orlando
if
you
are
i
would
not
lose
this
opportunity
of
fighting
with
you
to
be
king
of
paradise
talk
to
me
no
more
about
your
things
of
another
world
for
you
will
preach
in
vain
each
of
us
for
himself
and
let
the
sword
be
umpire
the
saracen
drew
his
sword
boldly
advancing
upon
orlando
and
a
combat
began
so
obstinate
and
so
long
each
warrior
being
a
miracle
of
prowess
that
the
story
says
it
lasted
from
noon
till
night
orlando
then
seeing
the
stars
come
out
was
the
first
to
propose
a
respite
what
are
we
to
do
said
he
now
that
daylight
has
left
us
agrican
answered
readily
enough
let
us
repose
in
this
meadow
and
renew
the
combat
at
dawn
the
repose
was
taken
accordingly
each
tied
up
his
horse
and
reclined
himself
on
the
grass
not
far
from
the
other
just
as
if
they
had
been
friends
orlando
by
the
fountain
agrican
beneath
a
pine
it
was
a
beautiful
clear
night
and
as
they
talked
together
before
addressing
themselves
to
sleep
the
champion
of
christendom
looking
up
at
the
firmament
said
that
is
a
fine
piece
of
workmanship
that
starry
spectacle
god
made
it
all
that
moon
of
silver
and
those
stars
of
gold
and
the
light
of
day
and
the
sun
all
for
the
sake
of
human
kind
you
wish
i
see
to
talk
of
matters
of
faith
said
the
tartar
now
i
may
as
well
tell
you
at
once
that
i
have
no
sort
of
skill
in
such
matters
nor
learning
of
any
kind
i
never
could
learn
anything
when
i
was
a
boy
i
hated
it
so
that
i
broke
the
head
who
was
commissioned
to
teach
me
and
it
produced
such
an
effect
on
others
that
nobody
ever
afterwards
dared
so
much
as
show
me
a
book
my
boyhood
was
therefore
passed
as
it
should
be
in
horsemanship
and
hunting
and
learning
to
fight
what
is
the
good
of
a
gentleman
poring
all
day
over
a
book
prowess
to
the
knight
and
preaching
to
the
clergyman
that
is
my
motto
i
acknowledge
returned
orlando
that
arms
are
the
first
consideration
of
a
gentleman
but
not
at
all
that
he
does
himself
dishonor
by
knowledge
on
the
contrary
knowledge
is
as
great
an
embellishment
of
the
rest
of
his
attainments
as
the
flowers
are
to
the
meadow
before
us
and
as
to
the
knowledge
of
his
maker
the
man
that
is
without
it
is
no
better
than
a
stock
or
a
stone
or
a
brute
beast
neither
without
study
can
he
reach
anything
of
a
due
sense
of
the
depth
and
divineness
of
the
contemplation
learned
or
not
learned
said
agrican
you
might
show
yourself
better
bred
than
by
endeavoring
to
make
me
talk
on
a
subject
on
which
you
have
me
at
a
disadvantage
if
you
choose
to
sleep
i
wish
you
good
night
but
if
you
prefer
talking
i
recommend
you
to
talk
of
fighting
or
of
fair
ladies
and
by
the
way
pray
tell
me
are
you
not
that
orlando
who
makes
such
a
noise
in
the
world
and
what
is
it
pray
that
brings
you
into
these
parts
were
you
ever
in
love
i
suppose
you
must
have
been
for
to
be
a
knight
and
never
to
have
been
in
love
would
be
like
being
a
man
without
a
heart
in
his
breast
the
count
replied
orlando
i
am
and
in
love
i
am
love
has
made
me
abandon
everything
and
brought
me
into
these
distant
regions
and
to
tell
you
all
in
one
word
my
heart
is
in
the
hands
of
the
daughter
of
king
galafron
you
have
come
against
him
with
fire
and
sword
to
get
possession
of
his
castles
and
his
dominions
and
i
have
come
to
help
him
for
no
object
in
the
world
but
to
please
his
daughter
and
win
her
beautiful
hand
i
care
for
nothing
else
in
existence
now
when
the
tartar
king
agrican
heard
his
antagonist
speak
in
this
manner
and
knew
him
to
be
indeed
orlando
and
to
be
in
love
with
angelica
his
face
changed
color
for
grief
and
jealousy
though
it
could
not
be
seen
for
the
darkness
his
heart
began
beating
with
such
violence
that
he
felt
as
if
he
should
have
died
well
said
he
to
orlando
we
are
to
fight
when
it
is
daylight
and
one
or
other
is
to
be
left
here
dead
on
the
ground
i
have
a
proposal
to
make
to
you
nay
an
entreaty
my
love
is
so
excessive
for
the
same
lady
that
i
beg
you
to
leave
her
to
me
i
will
owe
you
my
thanks
and
give
up
the
siege
and
put
an
end
to
the
war
i
can
not
bear
that
any
one
should
love
her
and
that
i
should
live
to
see
it
why
therefore
should
either
of
us
perish
give
her
up
not
a
soul
shall
know
it
i
never
yet
answered
orlando
made
a
promise
which
i
did
not
keep
and
nevertheless
i
own
to
you
that
were
i
to
make
a
promise
like
that
and
even
swear
to
keep
it
i
should
not
you
might
as
well
ask
me
to
tear
away
the
limbs
from
my
body
and
the
eyes
out
of
my
head
i
could
as
well
live
without
breath
itself
as
cease
loving
angelica
agrican
had
hardly
patience
to
let
him
finish
speaking
ere
he
leapt
furiously
on
horseback
though
it
was
midnight
quit
her
said
he
or
die
orlando
seeing
the
infidel
getting
up
and
not
being
sure
that
he
would
not
add
treachery
to
fierceness
had
been
hardly
less
quick
in
mounting
for
the
combat
never
exclaimed
he
i
never
could
have
quitted
her
if
i
would
and
now
i
would
not
if
i
could
you
must
seek
her
by
other
means
than
these
fiercely
dashed
their
horses
together
in
the
nighttime
on
the
green
mead
despiteful
and
terrible
were
the
blows
they
gave
and
took
by
the
moonlight
agrican
fought
in
a
rage
orlando
was
cooler
and
now
the
struggle
had
lasted
more
than
five
hours
and
day
began
to
dawn
when
the
tartar
king
furious
to
find
so
much
trouble
given
him
dealt
his
enemy
a
blow
sharp
and
violent
beyond
conception
it
cut
the
shield
in
two
as
if
it
had
been
made
of
wood
and
though
blood
could
not
be
drawn
from
orlando
because
he
was
fated
it
shook
and
bruised
him
as
if
it
had
started
every
joint
in
his
body
his
body
only
however
not
a
particle
of
his
soul
so
dreadful
was
the
blow
which
the
paladin
gave
in
return
that
not
only
shield
but
every
bit
of
mail
on
the
body
of
agrican
was
broken
in
pieces
and
three
of
his
ribs
cut
asunder
the
tartar
roaring
like
a
lion
raised
his
sword
with
still
greater
vehemence
than
before
and
dealt
a
blow
on
the
helmet
such
as
he
had
never
yet
received
from
mortal
man
for
a
moment
it
took
away
his
senses
his
sight
failed
his
ears
tingled
his
frightened
horse
turned
about
to
fly
and
he
was
falling
from
the
saddle
when
the
very
action
of
falling
threw
his
head
upwards
and
thus
recalled
his
recollection
what
a
shame
is
this
thought
he
how
shall
i
ever
again
dare
to
face
angelica
i
have
been
fighting
hour
after
hour
with
this
man
and
he
is
but
one
and
i
call
myself
orlando
if
the
combat
last
any
longer
i
will
bury
myself
in
a
monastery
and
never
look
on
sword
again
orlando
muttered
with
his
lips
closed
and
his
teeth
ground
together
and
you
might
have
thought
that
fire
instead
of
breath
came
out
of
his
nose
and
mouth
he
raised
his
sword
durindana
with
both
his
hands
and
sent
it
down
so
tremendously
on
shoulder
that
it
cut
through
breastplate
down
to
the
very
haunch
nay
crushed
the
though
it
was
made
of
bone
and
iron
and
felled
man
and
horse
to
the
earth
agrican
turned
as
white
as
ashes
and
felt
death
upon
him
he
called
orlando
to
come
close
to
him
with
a
gentle
voice
and
said
as
well
as
he
could
i
believe
on
him
who
died
on
the
cross
baptize
me
i
pray
thee
with
the
fountain
before
my
senses
are
gone
i
have
lived
an
evil
life
but
need
not
be
rebellious
to
god
in
death
also
may
he
who
came
to
save
all
the
rest
of
the
world
save
me
and
he
shed
tears
that
great
king
though
he
had
been
so
lofty
and
fierce
orlando
dismounted
quickly
with
his
own
face
in
tears
he
gathered
the
king
tenderly
in
his
arms
and
took
and
laid
him
by
the
fountain
on
a
marble
rim
that
it
had
and
then
he
wept
in
concert
with
him
heartily
and
asked
his
pardon
and
so
baptized
him
in
the
water
of
the
fountain
and
knelt
and
prayed
to
god
for
him
with
joined
hands
he
then
paused
and
looked
at
him
and
when
he
perceived
his
countenance
changed
and
that
his
whole
person
was
cold
he
left
him
there
on
the
marble
rim
of
the
fountain
all
armed
as
he
was
with
the
sword
by
his
side
and
the
crown
upon
his
head
adventures
of
rinaldo
and
orlando
we
left
rinaldo
when
having
overcome
the
monster
he
quitted
the
castle
of
altaripa
and
pursued
his
way
on
foot
he
soon
met
with
a
weeping
damsel
who
being
questioned
as
to
the
cause
of
her
sorrow
told
him
she
was
in
search
of
one
to
do
battle
to
rescue
her
lover
who
had
been
made
prisoner
by
a
vile
enchantress
together
with
orlando
and
many
more
the
damsel
was
flordelis
the
of
florismart
and
rinaldo
promised
his
assistance
trusting
to
accomplish
the
adventure
either
by
valor
or
skill
flordelis
insisted
upon
rinaldo
taking
her
horse
which
he
consented
to
do
on
condition
of
her
mounting
behind
him
as
they
rode
on
through
a
wood
they
heard
strange
noises
and
rinaldo
reassuring
the
damsel
pressed
forward
towards
the
quarter
from
which
they
proceeded
he
soon
perceived
a
giant
standing
under
a
vaulted
cavern
with
a
huge
club
in
his
hand
and
of
an
appearance
to
strike
the
boldest
spirit
with
dread
by
the
side
of
the
cavern
was
chained
a
griffin
which
together
with
the
giant
was
stationed
there
to
guard
a
wonderful
horse
the
same
which
was
once
argalia
this
horse
was
a
creature
of
enchantment
matchless
in
vigor
speed
and
form
which
disdained
to
share
the
diet
of
his
corn
or
grass
and
fed
only
on
air
his
name
was
rabican
this
marvellous
horse
after
his
master
argalia
had
been
slain
by
ferrau
finding
himself
at
liberty
returned
to
his
native
cavern
and
was
here
stabled
under
the
protection
of
the
giant
and
the
griffin
as
rinaldo
approached
the
giant
assailed
him
with
his
club
rinaldo
defended
himself
from
the
giant
blows
and
gave
him
one
in
return
which
if
his
skin
had
not
been
of
the
toughest
would
have
finished
the
combat
but
the
giant
though
wounded
escaped
and
let
loose
the
griffin
this
monstrous
bird
towered
in
air
and
thence
pounced
down
upon
rinaldo
who
watching
his
opportunity
dealt
her
a
desperate
wound
she
had
however
strength
for
another
flight
and
kept
repeating
her
attacks
which
rinaldo
parried
as
he
could
while
the
damsel
stood
trembling
by
witnessing
the
contest
the
battle
continued
rendered
more
terrible
by
the
approach
of
night
when
rinaldo
determined
upon
a
desperate
expedient
to
bring
it
to
a
conclusion
he
fell
as
if
fainting
from
his
wounds
and
on
the
close
approach
of
the
griffin
dealt
her
a
blow
which
sheared
away
one
of
her
wings
the
beast
though
sinking
griped
him
fast
with
her
talons
digging
through
plate
and
mail
but
rinaldo
plied
his
sword
in
utter
desperation
and
at
last
accomplished
her
destruction
rinaldo
then
entered
the
cavern
and
found
there
the
wonderful
horse
all
caparisoned
he
was
except
for
a
star
of
white
on
his
forehead
and
one
white
foot
behind
for
speed
he
was
unrivalled
though
in
strength
he
yielded
to
bayard
rinaldo
mounted
upon
rabican
and
issued
from
the
cavern
as
he
pursued
his
way
he
met
a
fugitive
from
agrican
army
who
gave
such
an
account
of
the
prowess
of
a
champion
who
fought
on
the
side
of
angelica
that
rinaldo
was
persuaded
this
must
be
orlando
though
at
a
loss
to
imagine
how
he
could
have
been
freed
from
captivity
he
determined
to
repair
to
the
scene
of
the
contest
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
and
flordelis
hoping
to
find
florismart
with
orlando
consented
to
accompany
him
while
these
things
were
doing
all
was
rout
and
dismay
in
the
tartarian
army
from
the
death
of
agrican
king
galafron
arriving
at
this
juncture
with
an
army
for
the
relief
of
his
capital
albracca
assaulted
the
enemy
camp
and
carried
all
before
him
rinaldo
had
now
reached
the
scene
of
action
and
was
looking
on
as
an
unconcerned
spectator
when
he
was
espied
by
galafron
the
king
instantly
recognized
the
horse
rabican
which
he
had
given
to
argalia
when
he
sent
him
forth
on
his
mission
to
paris
possessed
with
the
idea
that
the
rider
of
the
horse
was
the
murderer
of
argalia
galafron
rode
at
rinaldo
and
smote
him
with
all
his
force
rinaldo
was
not
slow
to
avenge
the
blow
and
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
the
king
had
not
his
followers
instantly
closed
round
him
and
separated
the
combatants
rinaldo
thus
found
himself
almost
without
his
own
choice
enlisted
on
the
side
of
the
enemies
of
angelica
which
gave
him
no
concern
so
completely
had
his
draught
from
the
fountain
of
hate
steeled
his
mind
against
her
for
several
successive
days
the
struggle
continued
without
any
important
results
rinaldo
meeting
the
bravest
knights
of
angelica
party
and
defeating
them
one
after
the
other
at
length
he
encountered
orlando
and
the
two
knights
bitterly
reproached
one
another
for
the
cause
they
had
each
adopted
and
engaged
in
a
furious
combat
orlando
was
mounted
upon
bayard
rinaldo
horse
which
agrican
had
by
chance
become
possessed
of
and
orlando
had
taken
from
him
as
the
prize
of
victory
bayard
would
not
fight
against
his
master
and
orlando
was
getting
the
worse
of
the
encounter
when
suddenly
rinaldo
seeing
astolpho
who
for
love
of
him
had
arrayed
himself
on
his
side
hard
beset
by
numbers
left
orlando
to
rush
to
the
defence
of
his
friend
night
prevented
the
combat
from
being
renewed
but
a
challenge
was
given
and
accepted
for
their
next
meeting
but
angelica
sighing
in
her
heart
for
rinaldo
was
not
willing
that
he
should
be
again
exposed
to
so
terrible
a
venture
she
begged
a
boon
of
orlando
promising
she
would
be
his
if
he
would
do
her
bidding
on
receiving
his
promise
she
enjoined
him
to
set
out
without
delay
to
destroy
the
garden
of
the
enchantress
falerina
in
which
many
valiant
knights
had
been
entrapped
and
were
imprisoned
orlando
departed
on
his
horse
brigliadoro
leaving
bayard
in
disgrace
for
his
bad
deportment
the
day
before
angelica
to
conciliate
rinaldo
sent
bayard
to
him
but
rinaldo
remained
unmoved
by
this
as
by
all
her
former
acts
of
kindness
when
rinaldo
learned
orlando
departure
he
yielded
to
the
entreaties
of
the
lady
of
florismart
and
prepared
to
fulfil
his
promise
and
rescue
her
lover
from
the
power
of
the
enchantress
thus
both
rinaldo
and
orlando
were
bound
upon
the
same
adventure
but
unknown
to
one
another
the
castle
of
falerina
was
protected
by
a
river
which
was
crossed
by
a
bridge
kept
by
a
ruffian
who
challenged
all
comers
to
the
combat
and
such
was
his
strength
that
he
had
thus
far
prevailed
in
every
encounter
as
appeared
by
the
arms
of
various
knights
which
he
had
taken
from
them
and
piled
up
as
a
trophy
on
the
shore
rinaldo
attacked
him
but
with
as
bad
success
as
the
rest
for
the
struck
him
so
violent
a
blow
with
an
iron
mace
that
he
fell
to
the
ground
but
when
the
villain
approached
to
strip
him
of
his
armor
rinaldo
seized
him
and
the
being
unable
to
free
himself
leapt
with
rinaldo
into
the
lake
where
they
both
disappeared
orlando
meanwhile
in
discharge
of
his
promise
to
angelica
pursued
his
way
in
quest
of
the
same
adventure
in
passing
through
a
wood
he
saw
a
cavalier
armed
at
all
points
and
mounted
keeping
guard
over
a
lady
who
was
bound
to
a
tree
weeping
bitterly
orlando
hastened
to
her
relief
but
was
exhorted
by
the
knight
not
to
interfere
for
she
had
deserved
her
fate
by
her
wickedness
in
proof
of
which
he
made
certain
charges
against
her
the
lady
denied
them
all
and
orlando
believed
her
defied
the
knight
overthrew
him
and
releasing
the
lady
departed
with
her
seated
on
his
horse
croup
while
they
rode
another
damsel
approached
on
a
white
palfrey
who
warned
orlando
of
impending
danger
and
informed
him
that
he
was
near
the
garden
of
the
enchantress
orlando
was
delighted
with
the
intelligence
and
entreated
her
to
inform
him
how
he
was
to
gain
admittance
she
replied
that
the
garden
could
only
be
entered
at
sunrise
and
gave
him
such
instructions
as
would
enable
him
to
gain
admittance
she
gave
him
also
a
book
in
which
was
painted
the
garden
and
all
that
it
contained
together
with
the
palace
of
the
false
enchantress
where
she
had
secluded
herself
for
the
purpose
of
executing
a
magic
work
in
which
she
was
engaged
this
was
the
manufacture
of
a
sword
capable
of
cutting
even
through
enchanted
substances
the
object
of
this
labor
the
damsel
told
him
was
the
destruction
of
a
knight
of
the
west
by
name
orlando
who
she
had
read
in
the
book
of
fate
was
coming
to
demolish
her
garden
having
thus
instructed
him
the
damsel
departed
orlando
finding
he
must
delay
his
enterprise
till
the
next
morning
now
lay
down
and
was
soon
asleep
seeing
this
the
base
woman
whom
he
had
rescued
and
who
was
intent
on
making
her
escape
to
rejoin
her
paramour
mounted
brigliadoro
and
rode
off
carrying
away
durindana
when
orlando
awoke
his
indignation
as
may
be
supposed
was
great
on
the
discovery
of
the
theft
but
like
a
good
knight
and
true
he
was
not
to
be
diverted
from
his
enterprise
he
tore
off
a
huge
branch
of
an
elm
to
supply
the
place
of
his
sword
and
as
the
sun
rose
took
his
way
towards
the
gate
of
the
garden
where
a
dragon
was
on
his
watch
this
he
slew
by
repeated
blows
and
entered
the
garden
the
gate
of
which
closed
behind
him
barring
retreat
looking
round
him
he
saw
a
fair
fountain
which
overflowed
into
a
river
and
in
the
centre
of
the
fountain
a
figure
on
whose
forehead
was
written
the
stream
which
waters
violet
and
rose
from
hence
to
the
enchanted
palace
goes
following
the
banks
of
this
flowing
stream
and
rapt
in
the
delights
of
the
charming
garden
orlando
arrived
at
the
palace
and
entering
it
found
the
mistress
clad
in
white
with
a
crown
of
gold
upon
her
head
in
the
act
of
viewing
herself
in
the
surface
of
the
magic
sword
orlando
surprised
her
before
she
could
escape
deprived
her
of
the
weapon
and
holding
her
fast
by
her
long
hair
which
floated
behind
threatened
her
with
immediate
death
if
she
did
not
yield
up
her
prisoners
and
afford
him
the
means
of
egress
she
however
was
firm
of
purpose
making
no
reply
and
orlando
unable
to
move
her
either
by
threats
or
entreaties
was
under
the
necessity
of
binding
her
to
a
beech
and
pursuing
his
quest
as
he
best
might
he
then
bethought
him
of
his
book
and
consulting
it
found
that
there
was
an
outlet
to
the
south
but
that
to
reach
it
a
lake
was
to
be
passed
inhabited
by
a
siren
whose
song
was
so
entrancing
as
to
be
quite
irresistible
to
whoever
heard
it
but
his
book
instructed
him
how
to
protect
himself
against
this
danger
according
to
its
directions
while
pursuing
his
path
he
gathered
abundance
of
flowers
which
sprung
all
around
and
filled
his
helmet
and
his
ears
with
them
then
listened
if
he
heard
the
birds
sing
finding
that
though
he
saw
the
gaping
beak
the
swelling
throat
and
ruffled
plumes
he
could
not
catch
a
note
he
felt
satisfied
with
his
defence
and
advanced
toward
the
lake
it
was
small
but
deep
and
so
clear
and
tranquil
that
the
eye
could
penetrate
to
the
bottom
he
had
no
sooner
arrived
upon
the
banks
than
the
waters
were
seen
to
gurgle
and
the
siren
rising
midway
out
of
the
pool
sung
so
sweetly
that
birds
and
beasts
came
trooping
to
the
to
listen
of
this
orlando
heard
nothing
but
feigning
to
yield
to
the
charm
sank
down
upon
the
bank
the
siren
issued
from
the
water
with
the
intent
to
accomplish
his
destruction
orlando
seized
her
by
the
hair
and
while
she
sang
yet
louder
song
being
her
only
defence
cut
off
her
head
then
following
the
directions
of
the
book
he
stained
himself
all
over
with
her
blood
guarded
by
this
talisman
he
met
successively
all
the
monsters
set
for
defence
of
the
enchantress
and
her
garden
and
at
length
found
himself
again
at
the
spot
where
he
had
made
captive
the
enchantress
who
still
continued
fastened
to
the
beech
but
the
scene
was
changed
the
garden
had
disappeared
and
falerina
before
so
haughty
now
begged
for
mercy
assuring
him
that
many
lives
depended
upon
the
preservation
of
hers
orlando
promised
her
life
upon
her
pledging
herself
for
the
deliverance
of
her
captives
this
however
was
no
easy
task
they
were
not
in
her
possession
but
in
that
of
a
much
more
powerful
enchantress
morgana
the
lady
of
the
lake
the
very
idea
of
opposing
whom
made
falerina
turn
pale
with
fear
representing
to
him
the
hazards
of
the
enterprise
she
led
him
towards
the
dwelling
of
morgana
to
approach
it
he
had
to
encounter
the
same
uncourteous
who
had
already
defeated
and
made
captive
so
many
knights
and
last
of
all
rinaldo
he
was
a
churl
of
the
most
ferocious
character
named
arridano
morgana
had
provided
him
with
impenetrable
armor
and
endowed
him
in
such
a
manner
that
his
strength
always
increased
in
proportion
to
that
of
the
adversary
with
whom
he
was
matched
no
one
had
ever
yet
escaped
from
the
contest
since
such
was
his
power
of
endurance
he
could
breathe
freely
under
water
hence
having
grappled
with
a
knight
and
sunk
with
him
to
the
bottom
of
the
lake
he
returned
bearing
his
enemy
arms
in
triumph
to
the
surface
while
falerina
was
repeating
her
cautions
and
her
counsels
orlando
saw
rinaldo
arms
erected
in
form
of
a
trophy
among
other
spoils
made
by
the
villain
and
forgetting
their
late
quarrel
determined
upon
revenging
his
friend
arriving
at
the
pass
the
churl
presuming
to
bar
the
way
a
desperate
contest
ensued
during
which
falerina
escaped
the
churl
finding
himself
overmatched
at
a
contest
of
arms
resorted
to
his
peculiar
art
grappled
his
antagonist
and
plunged
with
him
into
the
lake
when
he
reached
the
bottom
orlando
found
himself
in
another
world
upon
a
dry
meadow
with
the
lake
overhead
through
which
shone
the
beams
of
our
sun
while
the
water
stood
on
all
sides
like
a
crystal
wall
here
the
battle
was
renewed
and
orlando
had
in
his
magic
sword
an
advantage
which
none
had
hitherto
possessed
it
had
been
tempered
by
falerina
so
that
no
spells
could
avail
against
it
thus
armed
and
countervailing
the
strength
of
his
adversary
by
his
superior
skill
and
activity
it
was
not
long
before
he
laid
him
dead
upon
the
field
orlando
then
made
all
haste
to
return
to
the
upper
air
and
passing
through
the
water
which
opened
a
way
before
him
such
was
the
power
of
the
magic
sword
he
soon
regained
the
shore
and
found
himself
in
a
field
as
thickly
covered
with
precious
stones
as
the
sky
is
with
stars
orlando
crossed
the
field
not
tempted
to
delay
his
enterprise
by
gathering
any
of
the
brilliant
gems
spread
all
around
him
he
next
passed
into
a
flowery
meadow
planted
with
trees
covered
with
fruit
and
flowers
and
full
of
all
imaginable
delights
in
the
middle
of
this
meadow
was
a
fountain
and
fast
by
it
lay
morgana
asleep
a
lady
of
a
lovely
aspect
dressed
in
white
and
vermilion
garments
her
forehead
well
furnished
with
hair
while
she
had
scarcely
any
behind
while
orlando
stood
in
silence
contemplating
her
beauty
he
heard
a
voice
exclaim
seize
the
fairy
by
the
forelock
if
thou
hopest
fair
success
but
his
attention
was
arrested
by
another
object
and
he
heeded
not
the
warning
he
saw
on
a
sudden
an
array
of
towers
pinnacles
and
columns
palaces
with
balconies
and
windows
extended
alleys
with
trees
in
short
a
scene
of
architectural
magnificence
surpassing
all
he
had
ever
beheld
while
he
stood
gazing
in
silent
astonishment
the
scene
slowly
melted
away
and
disappeared
footnote
this
is
a
poetical
description
of
a
phenomenon
which
is
said
to
be
really
exhibited
in
the
strait
of
messina
between
sicily
and
calabria
it
is
called
fata
morgana
or
mirage
when
he
had
recovered
from
his
amazement
he
looked
again
toward
the
fountain
the
fairy
had
awaked
and
risen
and
was
dancing
round
its
border
with
the
lightness
of
a
leaf
timing
her
footsteps
to
this
song
who
in
this
world
would
wealth
and
treasure
share
honor
delight
and
state
and
what
is
best
quick
let
him
catch
me
by
the
lock
of
hair
which
flutters
from
my
forehead
and
be
blest
but
let
him
not
the
proffered
good
forbear
nor
till
he
seize
the
fleeting
blessing
rest
for
present
loss
is
sought
in
vain
and
the
deluded
wretch
is
left
in
sorrow
the
fairy
having
sung
thus
bounded
off
and
fled
from
the
flowery
meadow
over
a
high
and
inaccessible
mountain
orlando
pursued
her
through
thorns
and
rocks
while
the
sky
gradually
became
overcast
and
at
last
he
was
assailed
by
tempest
lightning
and
hail
while
he
thus
pursued
a
pale
and
meagre
woman
issued
from
a
cave
armed
with
a
whip
and
treading
close
upon
his
steps
scourged
him
with
vigorous
strokes
her
name
was
repentance
and
she
told
him
it
was
her
office
to
punish
those
who
neglected
to
obey
the
voice
of
prudence
and
seize
the
fairy
fortune
when
he
might
orlando
furious
at
this
chastisement
turned
upon
his
tormentor
but
might
as
well
have
stricken
the
wind
finding
it
useless
to
resist
he
resumed
his
chase
of
the
fairy
gained
upon
her
and
made
frequent
snatches
at
her
white
and
vermilion
garments
which
still
eluded
his
grasp
at
last
on
her
turning
her
head
for
an
instant
he
profited
by
the
chance
and
seized
her
by
the
forelock
in
an
instant
the
tempest
ceased
the
sky
became
serene
and
repentance
retreated
to
her
cave
orlando
now
demanded
of
morgana
the
keys
of
her
prison
and
the
fairy
feigning
a
complacent
aspect
delivered
up
a
key
of
silver
bidding
him
to
be
cautious
in
the
use
of
it
since
to
break
the
lock
would
be
to
involve
himself
and
all
in
inevitable
destruction
a
caution
which
gave
the
count
room
for
long
meditation
and
led
him
to
consider
how
few
amid
the
suitors
who
importune
the
dame
know
how
to
turn
the
keys
of
fortune
keeping
the
fairy
still
fast
by
the
forelock
orlando
proceeded
toward
the
prison
turned
the
key
without
occasioning
the
mischiefs
apprehended
and
delivered
the
prisoners
among
these
were
florismart
rinaldo
and
many
others
of
the
bravest
knights
of
france
morgana
had
disappeared
and
the
knights
under
the
guidance
of
orlando
retraced
the
path
by
which
he
had
come
they
soon
reached
the
field
of
treasure
rinaldo
finding
himself
amidst
this
mass
of
wealth
remembered
his
needy
garrison
of
montalban
and
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
seizing
part
of
the
booty
in
particular
a
golden
chain
studded
with
diamonds
was
too
much
for
his
and
he
took
it
and
was
bearing
it
off
notwithstanding
the
remonstrances
of
orlando
when
a
violent
wind
caught
him
and
whirled
him
back
as
he
approached
the
gate
this
happened
a
second
and
a
third
time
and
rinaldo
at
length
yielded
to
necessity
rather
than
to
the
entreaties
of
his
friends
and
cast
away
his
prize
they
soon
reached
the
bridge
and
passed
over
without
hindrance
to
the
other
side
where
they
found
the
trophy
decorated
with
their
arms
here
each
knight
resumed
his
own
and
all
except
the
paladins
and
their
friends
separated
as
their
inclinations
or
duty
prompted
dudon
the
dane
one
of
the
rescued
knights
informed
the
cousins
that
he
had
been
made
prisoner
by
morgana
while
in
the
discharge
of
an
embassy
to
them
from
charlemagne
who
called
upon
them
to
return
to
the
defence
of
christendom
orlando
was
too
much
fascinated
by
angelica
to
obey
this
summons
and
followed
by
the
faithful
florismart
who
would
not
leave
him
returned
towards
albracca
rinaldo
dudon
iroldo
prasildo
and
the
others
took
their
way
toward
the
west
the
invasion
of
france
agramant
king
of
africa
convoked
the
kings
his
vassals
to
deliberate
in
council
he
reminded
them
of
the
injuries
he
had
sustained
from
france
that
his
father
had
fallen
in
battle
with
charlemagne
and
that
his
early
years
had
hitherto
not
allowed
him
to
wipe
out
the
stain
of
former
defeats
he
now
proposed
to
them
to
carry
war
into
france
sobrino
his
wisest
councillor
opposed
the
project
representing
the
rashness
of
it
but
rodomont
the
young
and
fiery
king
of
algiers
denounced
sobrino
counsel
as
base
and
cowardly
declaring
himself
impatient
for
the
enterprise
the
king
of
the
garamantes
venerable
for
his
age
and
renowned
for
his
prophetic
lore
interposed
and
assured
the
king
that
such
an
attempt
would
be
sure
to
fail
unless
he
could
first
get
on
his
side
a
youth
marked
out
by
destiny
as
the
fitting
compeer
of
the
most
puissant
knights
of
france
the
young
rogero
descended
in
direct
line
from
hector
of
troy
this
prince
was
now
a
dweller
upon
the
mountain
carena
where
atlantes
his
a
powerful
magician
kept
him
in
retirement
having
discovered
by
his
art
that
his
pupil
would
be
lost
to
him
if
allowed
to
mingle
with
the
world
to
break
the
spells
of
atlantes
and
draw
rogero
from
his
retirement
one
only
means
was
to
be
found
it
was
a
ring
possessed
by
angelica
princess
of
cathay
which
was
a
talisman
against
all
enchantments
if
this
ring
could
be
procured
all
would
go
well
without
it
the
enterprise
was
desperate
rodomont
treated
this
declaration
of
the
old
prophet
with
scorn
and
it
would
probably
have
been
held
of
little
weight
by
the
council
had
not
the
aged
king
oppressed
by
the
weight
of
years
expired
in
the
very
act
of
reaffirming
his
prediction
this
made
so
deep
an
impression
on
the
council
that
it
was
unanimously
resolved
to
postpone
the
war
until
an
effort
should
be
made
to
win
rogero
to
the
camp
king
agramant
thereupon
proclaimed
that
the
sovereignty
of
a
kingdom
should
be
the
reward
of
whoever
should
succeed
in
obtaining
the
ring
of
angelica
brunello
the
dwarf
the
subtlest
thief
in
all
africa
undertook
to
procure
it
in
prosecution
of
this
design
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
angelica
kingdom
and
arrived
beneath
the
walls
of
albracca
while
the
besieging
army
was
encamped
before
the
fortress
while
the
attention
of
the
garrison
was
absorbed
by
the
battle
that
raged
below
he
scaled
the
walls
approached
the
princess
unnoticed
slipped
the
ring
from
her
finger
and
escaped
unobserved
he
hastened
to
the
seaside
and
finding
a
vessel
ready
to
sail
embarked
and
arrived
at
biserta
in
africa
here
he
found
agramant
impatient
for
the
talisman
which
was
to
foil
the
enchantments
of
atlantes
and
to
put
rogero
into
his
hands
the
dwarf
kneeling
before
the
king
presented
him
with
the
ring
and
agramant
delighted
at
the
success
of
his
mission
crowned
him
in
recompense
king
of
tingitana
all
were
now
anxious
to
go
in
quest
of
rogero
the
cavalcade
accordingly
departed
and
in
due
time
arrived
at
the
mountain
of
carena
at
the
bottom
of
this
was
a
fruitful
and
plain
watered
by
a
large
river
and
from
this
plain
was
descried
a
beautiful
garden
on
the
which
contained
the
mansion
of
atlantes
but
the
ring
which
discovered
what
was
before
invisible
could
not
though
it
revealed
this
paradise
enable
agramant
or
his
followers
to
enter
it
so
steep
and
smooth
was
the
rock
by
nature
that
even
brunello
failed
in
every
attempt
to
scale
it
he
did
not
for
this
despair
of
accomplishing
the
object
but
having
obtained
agramant
consent
caused
the
assembled
courtiers
and
knights
to
celebrate
a
tournament
upon
the
plain
below
this
was
done
with
the
view
of
seducing
rogero
from
his
fastness
and
the
stratagem
was
attended
with
success
rogero
joined
the
tourney
and
was
presented
by
agramant
with
a
splendid
horse
frontino
and
a
magnificent
sword
having
learned
from
agramant
his
intended
invasion
of
france
he
gladly
consented
to
join
the
expedition
rodomont
meanwhile
was
too
impatient
to
wait
for
arrangements
and
embarked
with
all
the
forces
he
could
raise
made
good
his
landing
on
the
coast
of
france
and
routed
the
christians
in
several
encounters
previously
to
this
however
gano
or
ganelon
as
he
is
sometimes
called
the
traitor
enemy
of
orlando
and
the
other
nephews
of
charlemagne
had
entered
into
a
traitorous
correspondence
with
marsilius
the
saracen
king
of
spain
whom
he
invited
into
france
marsilius
thus
encouraged
led
an
army
across
the
frontiers
and
joined
rodomont
this
was
the
situation
of
things
when
rinaldo
and
the
other
knights
who
had
obeyed
the
summons
of
dudon
set
forward
on
their
return
to
france
when
they
arrived
at
buda
in
hungary
they
found
the
king
of
that
country
about
despatching
his
son
ottachiero
with
an
army
to
the
succor
of
charlemagne
delighted
with
the
arrival
of
rinaldo
he
placed
his
son
and
troops
under
his
command
in
due
time
the
army
arrived
on
the
frontiers
of
france
and
united
with
the
troops
of
desiderius
king
of
lombardy
poured
down
into
provence
the
confederate
armies
had
not
marched
many
days
through
this
gay
tract
before
they
heard
a
crash
of
drums
and
trumpets
behind
the
hills
which
spoke
the
conflict
between
the
paynims
led
by
rodomont
and
the
christian
forces
rinaldo
witnessing
from
a
mountain
the
prowess
of
rodomont
left
his
troops
in
charge
of
his
friends
and
galloped
towards
him
with
his
lance
in
rest
the
impulse
was
irresistible
and
rodomont
was
unhorsed
but
rinaldo
unwilling
to
avail
himself
of
his
advantage
galloped
back
to
the
hill
and
having
secured
bayard
among
the
baggage
returned
to
finish
the
combat
on
foot
during
this
interval
the
battle
had
become
general
the
hungarians
were
routed
and
rinaldo
on
his
return
had
the
mortification
to
find
that
ottachiero
was
wounded
and
dudon
taken
prisoner
while
he
sought
rodomont
in
order
to
renew
the
combat
a
new
sound
of
drums
and
trumpets
was
heard
and
charlemagne
with
the
main
body
of
his
army
was
descried
advancing
in
battle
array
rodomont
seeing
this
mounted
the
horse
of
dudon
left
rinaldo
who
was
on
foot
and
galloped
off
to
encounter
this
new
enemy
agramant
accompanied
by
rogero
had
by
this
time
made
good
his
landing
and
joined
rodomont
with
all
his
forces
rogero
eagerly
embraced
this
first
opportunity
of
distinguishing
himself
and
spread
terror
wherever
he
went
encountering
in
turn
and
overthrowing
many
of
the
bravest
knights
of
france
at
length
he
found
himself
opposite
to
rinaldo
who
being
interrupted
as
we
have
said
in
his
combat
with
rodomont
and
unable
to
follow
him
being
on
foot
was
shouting
to
his
late
foe
to
return
and
finish
their
combat
rogero
also
was
on
foot
and
seeing
the
christian
knight
so
eager
for
a
contest
proffered
himself
to
supply
the
place
of
his
late
antagonist
rinaldo
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
moorish
prince
was
a
champion
worthy
of
his
arm
and
gladly
accepted
the
defiance
the
combat
was
stoutly
maintained
for
a
time
but
now
fortune
declared
decisively
in
favor
of
the
infidel
army
and
charlemagne
forces
gave
way
at
all
points
in
irreparable
confusion
the
two
combatants
were
separated
by
the
crowd
of
fugitives
and
pursuers
and
rinaldo
hastened
to
recover
possession
of
his
horse
but
bayard
in
the
confusion
had
got
loose
and
rinaldo
followed
him
into
a
thick
wood
thus
becoming
effectually
separated
from
rogero
rogero
also
seeking
his
horse
in
the
medley
came
where
two
warriors
were
engaged
in
mortal
combat
though
he
knew
not
who
they
were
he
could
distinguish
that
one
was
a
paynim
and
the
other
a
christian
and
moved
by
the
spirit
of
courtesy
he
approached
them
and
exclaimed
let
him
of
the
two
who
worships
christ
pause
and
hear
what
i
have
to
say
the
army
of
charles
is
routed
and
in
flight
so
that
if
he
wishes
to
follow
his
leader
he
has
no
time
for
delay
the
christian
knight
who
was
none
other
than
bradamante
a
female
warrior
in
prowess
equal
to
the
best
of
knights
was
thunderstruck
with
the
tidings
and
would
gladly
leave
the
contest
undecided
and
retire
from
the
field
but
rodomont
her
antagonist
would
by
no
means
consent
rogero
indignant
at
his
discourtesy
insisted
upon
her
departure
while
he
took
up
her
quarrel
with
rodomont
the
combat
obstinately
maintained
on
both
sides
was
interrupted
by
the
return
of
bradamante
finding
herself
unable
to
overtake
the
fugitives
and
reluctant
to
leave
to
another
the
burden
and
risk
of
a
contest
which
belonged
to
herself
she
had
returned
to
reclaim
the
combat
she
arrived
however
when
her
champion
had
dealt
his
enemy
such
a
blow
as
obliged
him
to
drop
both
his
sword
and
bridle
rogero
disdaining
to
profit
by
his
defenceless
situation
sat
apart
upon
his
horse
while
that
of
rodomont
bore
his
rider
stunned
and
stupefied
about
the
field
bradamante
approached
rogero
conceiving
a
yet
higher
opinion
of
his
valor
on
beholding
such
an
instance
of
forbearance
she
addressed
him
excusing
herself
for
leaving
him
exposed
to
an
enemy
from
his
interference
in
her
cause
pleading
her
duty
to
her
sovereign
as
the
motive
while
she
spoke
rodomont
recovered
from
his
confusion
rode
up
to
them
his
bearing
was
however
changed
and
he
disclaimed
all
thoughts
of
further
contest
with
one
who
he
said
had
already
conquered
him
by
his
courtesy
so
saying
he
quitted
his
antagonist
picked
up
his
sword
and
spurred
out
of
sight
bradamante
was
now
again
desirous
of
retiring
from
the
field
and
rogero
insisted
on
accompanying
her
though
yet
unaware
of
her
sex
as
they
pursued
their
way
she
inquired
the
name
and
quality
of
her
new
associate
and
rogero
informed
her
of
his
nation
and
family
he
told
her
that
astyanax
the
son
of
hector
of
troy
established
the
kingdom
of
messina
in
sicily
from
him
were
derived
two
branches
which
gave
origin
to
two
families
of
renown
from
one
sprang
the
royal
race
of
pepin
and
charlemagne
and
from
the
other
that
of
reggio
in
italy
from
that
of
reggio
am
i
derived
he
continued
my
mother
driven
from
her
home
by
the
chance
of
war
died
in
giving
me
life
and
i
was
taken
in
charge
by
a
sage
enchanter
who
trained
me
to
feats
of
arms
amidst
the
dangers
of
the
desert
and
the
chase
having
thus
ended
his
tale
rogero
entreated
a
similar
return
of
courtesy
from
his
companion
who
replied
without
disguise
that
she
was
of
the
race
of
clermont
and
sister
to
rinaldo
whose
fame
was
perhaps
known
to
him
rogero
much
moved
by
this
intelligence
entreated
her
to
take
off
her
helmet
and
at
the
discovery
of
her
face
remained
transported
with
delight
while
absorbed
in
this
contemplation
an
unexpected
danger
assailed
them
a
party
which
was
placed
in
a
wood
in
order
to
intercept
the
retreating
christians
broke
from
its
ambush
upon
the
pair
and
bradamante
who
was
uncasqued
was
wounded
in
the
head
rogero
was
in
a
fury
at
this
attack
and
bradamante
replacing
her
helmet
joined
him
in
taking
speedy
vengeance
on
their
enemies
they
cleared
the
field
of
them
but
became
separated
in
the
pursuit
and
rogero
quitting
the
chase
wandered
by
hill
and
vale
in
search
of
her
whom
he
had
no
sooner
found
than
lost
while
pursuing
this
quest
he
fell
in
with
two
knights
whom
he
joined
and
engaged
them
to
assist
him
in
the
search
of
his
companion
describing
her
arms
but
concealing
from
a
certain
feeling
of
jealousy
her
quality
and
sex
it
was
evening
when
they
joined
company
and
having
ridden
together
through
the
night
the
morning
was
beginning
to
break
when
one
of
the
strangers
fixing
his
eyes
upon
rogero
shield
demanded
of
him
by
what
right
he
bore
the
trojan
arms
rogero
declared
his
origin
and
race
and
then
in
his
turn
interrogated
the
inquirer
as
to
his
pretensions
to
the
cognizance
of
hector
which
he
bore
the
stranger
replied
my
name
is
mandricardo
son
of
agrican
the
tartar
king
whom
orlando
treacherously
slew
i
say
treacherously
for
in
fair
fight
he
could
not
have
done
it
it
is
in
search
of
him
that
i
have
come
to
france
to
take
vengeance
for
my
father
and
to
wrest
from
him
durindana
that
famous
sword
which
belongs
to
me
and
not
to
him
when
the
knights
demanded
to
know
by
what
right
he
claimed
durindana
mandricardo
thus
related
his
history
i
had
been
before
the
death
of
my
father
a
wild
and
reckless
youth
that
event
awakened
my
energies
and
drove
me
forth
to
seek
for
vengeance
determined
to
owe
success
to
nothing
but
my
own
exertions
i
departed
without
attendants
or
horse
or
arms
travelling
thus
alone
and
on
foot
i
espied
one
day
a
pavilion
pitched
near
a
fountain
and
entered
it
intent
on
adventure
i
found
therein
a
damsel
of
gracious
aspect
who
replied
to
my
inquiries
that
the
fountain
was
the
work
of
a
fairy
whose
castle
stood
beyond
a
neighboring
hill
where
she
kept
watch
over
a
treasure
which
many
knights
had
tried
to
win
but
fruitlessly
having
lost
their
life
or
liberty
in
the
attempt
this
treasure
was
the
armor
of
hector
prince
of
troy
whom
achilles
treacherously
slew
nothing
was
wanting
but
his
sword
durindana
and
this
had
fallen
into
the
possession
of
a
queen
named
penthesilea
from
whom
it
passed
through
her
descendants
to
almontes
whom
orlando
slew
and
thus
became
possessed
of
the
sword
the
rest
of
hector
arms
were
saved
and
carried
off
by
aeneas
from
whom
this
fairy
received
them
in
recompense
of
service
rendered
you
have
the
courage
to
attempt
their
acquisition
said
the
damsel
will
be
your
guide
mandricardo
went
on
to
say
that
he
eagerly
embraced
the
proposal
and
being
provided
with
horse
and
armor
by
the
damsel
set
forth
on
his
enterprise
the
lady
accompanying
him
as
they
rode
she
explained
the
dangers
of
the
quest
the
armor
was
defended
by
a
champion
one
of
the
numerous
unsuccessful
adventurers
for
the
prize
all
of
whom
had
been
made
prisoners
by
the
fairy
and
compelled
to
take
their
turn
day
by
day
in
defending
the
arms
against
all
comers
thus
speaking
they
arrived
at
the
castle
which
was
of
alabaster
overlaid
with
gold
before
it
on
a
lawn
sat
an
armed
knight
on
horseback
who
was
none
other
than
gradasso
king
of
sericane
who
in
his
return
home
from
his
unsuccessful
inroad
into
france
had
fallen
into
the
power
of
the
fairy
and
was
held
to
do
her
bidding
mandricardo
upon
seeing
him
dropt
his
visor
and
laid
his
lance
in
rest
the
champion
of
the
castle
was
equally
ready
and
each
spurred
towards
his
opponent
they
met
one
another
with
equal
force
splintered
their
spears
and
returning
to
the
charge
encountered
with
their
swords
the
contest
was
long
and
doubtful
when
mandricardo
determined
to
bring
it
to
an
end
threw
his
arms
about
gradasso
grappled
with
him
and
both
fell
to
the
ground
mandricardo
however
fell
uppermost
and
preserving
his
advantage
compelled
gradasso
to
yield
himself
conquered
the
damsel
now
interfered
congratulating
the
victor
and
consoling
the
vanquished
as
well
as
she
might
mandricardo
and
the
damsel
proceeded
to
the
gate
of
the
castle
which
they
found
undefended
as
they
entered
they
beheld
a
shield
suspended
from
a
pilaster
of
gold
the
device
was
a
white
eagle
on
an
azure
field
in
memory
of
the
bird
of
jove
which
bore
away
ganymede
the
flower
of
the
phrygian
race
beneath
was
engraved
the
following
couplet
let
none
with
hand
profane
my
buckler
wrong
unless
he
be
himself
as
hector
strong
the
damsel
alighting
from
her
palfrey
made
obeisance
to
the
arms
bending
herself
to
the
ground
the
tartar
king
bowed
his
head
with
equal
reverence
then
advancing
towards
the
shield
touched
it
with
his
sword
thereupon
an
earthquake
shook
the
ground
and
the
way
by
which
he
had
entered
closed
another
and
an
opposite
gate
opened
and
displayed
a
field
bristling
with
stalks
and
grain
of
gold
the
damsel
upon
this
told
him
that
he
had
no
means
of
retreat
but
by
cutting
down
the
harvest
which
was
before
him
and
by
uprooting
a
tree
which
grew
in
the
middle
of
the
field
mandricardo
without
replying
began
to
mow
the
harvest
with
his
sword
but
had
scarce
smitten
thrice
when
he
perceived
that
every
stalk
that
fell
was
instantly
transformed
into
some
poisonous
or
ravenous
animal
which
prepared
to
assail
him
instructed
by
the
damsel
he
snatched
up
a
stone
and
cast
it
among
the
pack
a
strange
wonder
followed
for
no
sooner
had
the
stone
fallen
among
the
beasts
than
they
turned
their
rage
against
one
another
and
rent
each
other
to
pieces
mandricardo
did
not
stop
to
marvel
at
the
miracle
but
proceeded
to
fulfil
his
task
and
uproot
the
tree
he
clasped
it
round
the
trunk
and
made
vigorous
efforts
to
tear
it
up
by
the
roots
at
each
effort
fell
a
shower
of
leaves
that
were
instantly
changed
into
birds
of
prey
which
attacked
the
knight
flapping
their
wings
in
his
face
with
horrid
screeching
but
undismayed
by
this
new
annoyance
he
continued
to
tug
at
the
trunk
till
it
yielded
to
his
efforts
a
burst
of
wind
and
thunder
followed
and
the
hawks
and
vultures
flew
screaming
away
but
these
only
gave
place
to
a
new
foe
for
from
the
hole
made
by
tearing
up
the
tree
issued
a
furious
serpent
and
darting
at
mandricardo
wound
herself
about
his
limbs
with
a
strain
that
almost
crushed
him
fortune
however
again
stood
his
friend
for
writhing
under
the
folds
of
the
monster
he
fell
backwards
into
the
hole
and
his
enemy
was
crushed
beneath
his
weight
mandricardo
when
he
was
somewhat
recovered
and
assured
himself
of
the
destruction
of
the
serpent
began
to
contemplate
the
place
into
which
he
had
fallen
and
saw
that
he
was
in
a
vault
incrusted
with
costly
metals
and
illuminated
by
a
live
coal
in
the
middle
was
a
sort
of
ivory
bier
and
upon
this
was
extended
what
appeared
to
be
a
knight
in
armor
but
was
in
truth
an
empty
trophy
composed
of
the
rich
and
precious
arms
once
hector
to
which
nothing
was
wanting
but
the
sword
while
mandricardo
stood
contemplating
the
prize
a
door
opened
behind
him
and
a
bevy
of
fair
damsels
entered
dancing
who
taking
up
the
armor
piece
by
piece
led
him
away
to
the
place
where
the
shield
was
suspended
where
he
found
the
fairy
of
the
castle
seated
in
state
by
her
he
was
invested
with
the
arms
he
had
won
first
pledging
his
solemn
oath
to
wear
no
other
blade
but
durindana
which
he
was
to
wrest
from
orlando
and
thus
complete
the
conquest
of
hector
arms
the
invasion
of
france
continued
mandricardo
having
completed
his
story
now
turned
to
rogero
and
proposed
that
arms
should
decide
which
of
the
two
was
most
worthy
to
bear
the
symbol
of
the
trojan
knight
rogero
felt
no
other
objection
to
this
proposal
than
the
scruple
which
arose
on
observing
that
his
antagonist
was
without
a
sword
mandricardo
insisted
that
this
need
be
no
impediment
since
his
oath
prevented
him
from
using
a
sword
until
he
should
have
achieved
the
conquest
of
durindana
this
was
no
sooner
said
than
a
new
antagonist
started
up
in
gradasso
who
now
accompanied
mandricardo
gradasso
vindicated
his
prior
right
to
durindana
to
obtain
which
he
had
embarked
as
was
related
in
the
beginning
in
that
bold
inroad
upon
france
a
quarrel
was
thus
kindled
between
the
kings
of
tartary
and
sericane
while
the
dispute
was
raging
a
knight
arrived
upon
the
ground
accompanied
by
a
damsel
to
whom
rogero
related
the
cause
of
the
strife
the
knight
was
florismart
and
his
companion
flordelis
florismart
succeeded
in
bringing
the
two
champions
to
accord
by
informing
them
that
he
could
bring
them
to
the
presence
of
orlando
the
master
of
durindana
gradasso
and
mandricardo
readily
made
truce
in
order
to
accompany
florismart
nor
would
rogero
be
left
behind
as
they
proceeded
on
their
quest
they
were
met
by
a
dwarf
who
entreated
their
assistance
in
behalf
of
his
lady
who
had
been
carried
off
by
an
enchanter
mounted
on
a
winged
horse
however
unwilling
to
leave
the
question
of
the
sword
undecided
it
was
not
possible
for
the
knights
to
resist
this
appeal
two
of
their
number
gradasso
and
rogero
therefore
accompanied
the
dwarf
mandricardo
persisted
in
his
search
for
orlando
and
florismart
with
flordelis
pursued
their
way
to
the
camp
of
charlemagne
atlantes
the
enchanter
who
had
brought
up
rogero
and
cherished
for
him
the
warmest
affection
knew
by
his
art
that
his
pupil
was
destined
to
be
severed
from
him
and
converted
to
the
christian
faith
through
the
influence
of
bradamante
that
royal
maiden
with
whom
chance
had
brought
him
acquainted
thinking
to
thwart
the
will
of
heaven
in
this
respect
he
now
put
forth
all
his
arts
to
entrap
rogero
into
his
power
by
the
aid
of
his
subservient
demons
he
reared
a
castle
on
an
inaccessible
height
in
the
pyrenean
mountains
and
to
make
it
a
pleasant
abode
to
his
pupil
contrived
to
entrap
and
convey
thither
knights
and
damsels
many
a
one
whom
chance
had
brought
into
the
vicinity
of
his
castle
here
in
a
sort
of
sensual
paradise
they
were
but
too
willing
to
forget
glory
and
duty
and
to
pass
their
time
in
indolent
enjoyment
it
was
by
the
enchanter
that
the
dwarf
had
now
been
sent
to
tempt
the
knights
into
his
power
but
we
must
now
return
to
rinaldo
whom
we
left
interrupted
in
his
combat
with
rodomont
in
search
of
his
late
antagonist
and
intent
on
bringing
their
combat
to
a
decision
he
entered
the
forest
of
arden
whither
he
suspected
rodomont
had
gone
while
engaged
on
this
quest
he
was
surprised
by
the
vision
of
a
beautiful
child
dancing
naked
with
three
damsels
as
beautiful
as
himself
while
he
was
lost
in
admiration
at
the
sight
the
child
approached
him
and
throwing
at
him
handfuls
of
roses
and
lilies
struck
him
from
his
horse
he
was
no
sooner
down
than
he
was
seized
by
the
dancers
by
whom
he
was
dragged
about
and
scourged
with
flowers
till
he
fell
into
a
swoon
when
he
began
to
revive
one
of
the
group
approached
him
and
told
him
that
his
punishment
was
the
consequence
of
his
rebellion
against
that
power
before
whom
all
things
bend
that
there
was
but
one
remedy
to
heal
the
wounds
that
had
been
inflicted
and
that
was
to
drink
of
the
waters
of
love
then
they
left
him
rinaldo
sore
and
faint
dragged
himself
toward
a
fountain
which
flowed
near
by
and
being
parched
with
thirst
drank
greedily
and
almost
unconsciously
of
the
water
which
was
sweet
to
the
taste
but
bitter
to
the
heart
after
repeated
draughts
he
recovered
his
strength
and
recollection
and
found
himself
in
the
same
place
where
angelica
had
formerly
awakened
him
with
a
rain
of
flowers
and
whence
he
had
fled
in
contempt
of
her
courtesy
this
remembrance
of
the
scene
was
followed
by
the
recognition
of
his
crime
and
repenting
bitterly
his
ingratitude
he
leaped
upon
bayard
with
the
intention
of
hastening
to
angelica
country
and
soliciting
his
pardon
at
her
feet
let
us
now
retrace
our
steps
and
revert
to
the
time
when
the
paladins
having
learned
from
dudon
the
summons
of
charlemagne
to
return
to
france
to
repel
the
invaders
had
all
obeyed
the
command
with
the
exception
of
orlando
whose
passion
for
angelica
still
held
him
in
attendance
on
her
orlando
arriving
before
albracca
found
it
closely
beleaguered
he
however
made
his
way
into
the
citadel
and
related
his
adventures
to
angelica
from
the
time
of
his
departure
up
to
his
separation
from
rinaldo
and
the
rest
when
they
departed
to
the
assistance
of
charlemagne
angelica
in
return
described
the
distresses
of
the
garrison
and
the
force
of
the
besiegers
and
in
conclusion
prayed
orlando
to
favor
her
escape
from
the
pressing
danger
and
escort
her
into
france
orlando
who
did
not
suspect
that
love
for
rinaldo
was
her
secret
motive
joyfully
agreed
to
the
proposal
and
the
sally
was
resolved
upon
leaving
lights
burning
in
the
fortress
they
departed
at
nightfall
and
passed
in
safety
through
the
enemy
camp
after
encountering
numerous
adventures
they
reached
the
and
embarked
on
board
a
pinnace
for
france
the
vessel
arrived
safely
and
the
travellers
disembarking
in
provence
pursued
their
way
by
land
one
day
heated
and
weary
they
sought
shelter
from
the
sun
in
the
forest
of
arden
and
chance
directed
angelica
to
the
fountain
of
disdain
of
whose
waters
she
eagerly
drank
issuing
thence
the
count
and
damsel
encountered
a
knight
it
was
no
other
than
rinaldo
who
was
just
on
the
point
of
setting
off
on
a
pilgrimage
in
search
of
angelica
to
implore
her
pardon
for
his
insensibility
and
urge
his
new
found
passion
surprise
and
delight
at
first
deprived
him
of
utterance
but
soon
recovering
himself
he
joyfully
saluted
her
claiming
her
as
his
and
exhorting
her
to
put
herself
under
his
protection
his
presumption
was
repelled
by
angelica
with
disdain
and
orlando
enraged
at
the
invasion
of
his
rights
challenged
him
to
decide
their
claims
by
arms
terrified
at
the
combat
which
ensued
angelica
fled
amain
through
the
forest
and
came
out
upon
a
plain
covered
with
tents
this
was
the
camp
of
charlemagne
who
led
the
army
of
reserve
destined
to
support
the
troops
which
had
advanced
to
oppose
marsilius
charles
having
heard
the
damsel
tale
with
difficulty
separated
the
two
cousins
and
then
consigned
angelica
as
the
cause
of
quarrel
to
the
care
of
namo
duke
of
bavaria
promising
that
she
should
be
his
who
should
best
deserve
her
in
the
impending
battle
but
these
plans
and
hopes
were
frustrated
the
christian
army
beaten
at
all
points
fled
from
the
saracens
and
angelica
indifferent
to
both
her
lovers
mounted
a
swift
palfrey
and
plunged
into
the
forest
rejoicing
in
spite
of
her
terror
at
having
regained
her
liberty
she
stopped
at
last
in
a
tufted
grove
where
a
gentle
zephyr
blew
and
whose
young
trees
were
watered
by
two
clear
runnels
which
came
and
mingled
their
waters
making
a
pleasing
murmur
believing
herself
far
from
rinaldo
and
overcome
by
fatigue
and
the
summer
heat
she
saw
with
delight
a
bank
covered
with
flowers
so
thick
that
they
almost
hid
the
green
turf
inviting
her
to
alight
and
rest
she
dismounted
from
her
palfrey
and
turned
him
loose
to
recruit
his
strength
with
the
tender
grass
which
bordered
the
streamlets
then
in
a
sheltered
nook
tapestried
with
moss
and
fenced
in
with
roses
and
flowers
she
yielded
herself
to
grateful
repose
she
had
not
slept
long
when
she
was
awakened
by
the
noise
made
by
the
approach
of
a
horse
starting
up
she
saw
an
armed
knight
who
had
arrived
at
the
bank
of
the
stream
not
knowing
whether
he
was
to
be
feared
or
not
her
heart
beat
with
anxiety
she
pressed
aside
the
leaves
to
allow
her
to
see
who
it
was
but
scarce
dared
to
breathe
for
fear
of
betraying
herself
soon
the
knight
threw
himself
on
the
flowery
bank
and
leaning
his
head
on
his
hand
fell
into
a
profound
reverie
then
arousing
himself
from
his
silence
he
began
to
pour
forth
complaints
mingled
with
deep
sighs
rivers
of
tears
flowed
down
his
cheeks
and
his
breast
seemed
to
labor
with
a
hidden
flame
ah
vain
regrets
he
exclaimed
cruel
fortune
others
triumph
while
i
endure
hopeless
misery
better
a
thousand
times
to
lose
life
than
wear
a
chain
so
disgraceful
and
so
oppressive
angelica
by
this
time
had
recognized
the
stranger
and
perceived
that
it
was
sacripant
king
of
circassia
one
of
the
worthiest
of
her
suitors
this
prince
had
followed
angelica
from
his
country
at
the
very
gates
of
the
day
to
france
where
he
heard
with
dismay
that
she
was
under
the
guardianship
of
the
paladin
orlando
and
that
the
emperor
had
announced
his
decree
to
award
her
as
the
prize
of
valor
to
that
one
of
his
nephews
who
should
best
deserve
her
as
sacripant
continued
to
lament
angelica
who
had
always
opposed
the
hardness
of
marble
to
his
sighs
thought
with
herself
that
nothing
forbade
her
employing
his
good
offices
in
this
unhappy
crisis
though
firmly
resolved
never
to
accept
him
as
a
spouse
she
yet
felt
the
necessity
of
giving
him
a
gleam
of
hope
in
reward
for
the
service
she
required
of
him
all
at
once
like
diana
she
stepped
forth
from
the
arbor
may
the
gods
preserve
thee
she
said
and
put
far
from
thee
all
hard
thoughts
of
me
then
she
told
him
all
that
had
befallen
her
since
she
parted
with
him
at
her
father
court
and
how
she
had
availed
herself
of
protection
to
escape
from
the
beleaguered
city
at
that
moment
the
noise
of
horse
and
armor
was
heard
as
of
one
approaching
and
sacripant
furious
at
the
interruption
resumed
his
helmet
mounted
his
horse
and
placed
his
lance
in
rest
he
saw
a
knight
advancing
with
scarf
and
plume
of
snowy
whiteness
sacripant
regarded
him
with
angry
eyes
and
while
he
was
yet
some
distance
off
defied
him
to
the
combat
the
other
not
moved
by
his
angry
tone
to
make
reply
put
himself
on
his
defence
their
horses
struck
at
the
same
moment
with
the
spur
rushed
upon
one
another
with
the
impetuosity
of
a
tempest
their
shields
were
pierced
each
with
the
other
lance
and
only
the
temper
of
their
breastplates
saved
their
lives
both
the
horses
recoiled
with
the
violence
of
the
shock
but
the
unknown
knight
recovered
itself
at
the
touch
of
the
spur
the
saracen
king
fell
dead
and
bore
down
his
master
with
him
the
white
knight
seeing
his
enemy
in
this
condition
cared
not
to
renew
the
combat
but
thinking
he
had
done
enough
for
glory
pursued
his
way
through
the
forest
and
was
a
mile
off
before
sacripant
had
got
free
from
his
horse
as
a
ploughman
stunned
by
a
which
has
stricken
dead
the
oxen
at
his
plough
stands
motionless
sadly
contemplating
his
loss
so
sacripant
stood
confounded
and
overwhelmed
with
mortification
at
having
angelica
a
witness
of
his
defeat
he
groaned
he
sighed
less
from
the
pain
of
his
bruises
than
for
the
shame
of
being
reduced
to
such
a
state
before
her
the
princess
took
pity
on
him
and
consoled
him
as
well
as
she
could
banish
your
regrets
my
lord
she
said
this
accident
has
happened
solely
in
consequence
of
the
feebleness
of
your
horse
which
had
more
need
of
rest
and
food
than
of
such
an
encounter
as
this
nor
can
your
adversary
gain
any
credit
by
it
since
he
has
hurried
away
not
venturing
a
second
trial
while
she
thus
consoled
sacripant
they
perceived
a
person
approach
who
seemed
a
courier
with
bag
and
horn
as
soon
as
he
came
up
he
accosted
sacripant
and
inquired
if
he
had
seen
a
knight
pass
that
way
bearing
a
white
shield
and
with
a
white
plume
to
his
helmet
i
have
indeed
seen
too
much
of
him
said
sacripant
it
is
he
who
has
brought
me
to
the
ground
but
at
least
i
hope
to
learn
from
you
who
that
knight
is
that
i
can
easily
inform
you
said
the
man
know
then
that
if
you
have
been
overthrown
you
owe
your
fate
to
the
high
prowess
of
a
lady
as
beautiful
as
she
is
brave
it
is
the
fair
and
illustrious
bradamante
who
has
won
from
you
the
honors
of
victory
at
these
words
the
courier
rode
on
his
way
leaving
sacripant
more
confounded
and
mortified
than
ever
in
silence
he
mounted
the
horse
of
angelica
taking
the
lady
behind
him
on
the
croup
and
rode
away
in
search
of
a
more
secure
asylum
hardly
had
they
ridden
two
miles
when
a
new
sound
was
heard
in
the
forest
and
they
perceived
a
gallant
and
powerful
horse
which
leaping
the
ravines
and
dashing
aside
the
branches
that
opposed
his
passage
appeared
before
them
accoutred
with
a
rich
harness
adorned
with
gold
if
i
may
believe
my
eyes
which
penetrate
with
difficulty
the
underwood
said
angelica
that
horse
that
dashes
so
stoutly
through
the
bushes
is
bayard
and
i
marvel
how
he
seems
to
know
the
need
we
have
of
him
mounted
as
we
are
both
on
one
feeble
animal
sacripant
dismounting
from
the
palfrey
approached
the
fiery
courser
and
attempted
to
seize
his
bridle
but
the
disdainful
animal
turning
from
him
launched
at
him
a
volley
of
kicks
enough
to
have
shattered
a
wall
of
marble
bayard
then
approached
angelica
with
an
air
as
gentle
and
loving
as
a
faithful
dog
could
his
master
after
a
long
separation
for
he
remembered
how
she
had
caressed
him
and
even
fed
him
in
albracca
she
took
his
bridle
in
her
left
hand
while
with
her
right
she
patted
his
neck
the
beautiful
animal
gifted
with
wonderful
intelligence
seemed
to
submit
entirely
sacripant
seizing
the
moment
to
vault
upon
him
controlled
his
curvetings
and
angelica
quitting
the
croup
of
the
palfrey
regained
her
seat
but
turning
his
eyes
toward
a
place
where
was
heard
a
noise
of
arms
sacripant
beheld
rinaldo
that
hero
now
loves
angelica
more
than
his
life
and
she
flies
him
as
the
timid
crane
the
falcon
the
fountain
of
which
angelica
had
drunk
produced
such
an
effect
on
the
beautiful
queen
that
with
distressed
countenance
and
trembling
voice
she
conjured
sacripant
not
to
wait
the
approach
of
rinaldo
but
to
join
her
in
flight
am
i
then
said
sacripant
of
so
little
esteem
with
you
that
you
doubt
my
power
to
defend
you
do
you
forget
the
battle
of
albracca
and
how
in
your
defence
i
fought
against
agrican
and
all
his
knights
angelica
made
no
reply
uncertain
what
to
do
but
already
rinaldo
was
too
near
to
be
escaped
he
advanced
menacingly
to
the
circassian
king
for
he
recognized
his
horse
vile
thief
he
cried
dismount
from
that
horse
and
prevent
the
punishment
that
is
your
due
for
daring
to
rob
me
of
my
property
leave
also
the
princess
in
my
hands
for
it
would
indeed
be
a
sin
to
suffer
so
charming
a
lady
and
so
gallant
a
charger
to
remain
in
such
keeping
the
king
of
circassia
furious
at
being
thus
insulted
cried
out
thou
liest
villain
in
giving
me
the
name
of
thief
which
better
belongs
to
thyself
than
to
me
it
is
true
the
beauty
of
this
lady
and
the
perfection
of
this
horse
are
unequalled
come
on
then
and
let
us
try
which
of
us
is
most
worthy
to
possess
them
at
these
words
the
king
of
circassia
and
rinaldo
attacked
one
another
with
all
their
force
one
fighting
on
foot
the
other
on
horseback
you
need
not
however
suppose
that
the
saracen
king
found
any
advantage
in
this
for
a
young
page
unused
to
horsemanship
could
not
have
failed
more
completely
to
manage
bayard
than
did
this
accomplished
knight
the
faithful
animal
loved
his
master
too
well
to
injure
him
and
refused
his
aid
as
well
as
his
obedience
to
the
hand
of
sacripant
who
could
strike
but
ineffectual
blows
the
horse
backing
when
he
wished
him
to
go
forward
and
dropping
his
head
and
arching
his
back
throwing
out
with
his
legs
so
as
almost
to
shake
the
knight
out
of
the
saddle
sacripant
seeing
that
he
could
not
manage
him
watched
his
opportunity
rose
on
his
saddle
and
leapt
lightly
to
the
earth
then
relieved
from
the
embarrassment
of
the
horse
renewed
the
combat
on
more
equal
terms
their
skill
to
thrust
and
parry
were
equal
one
rises
the
other
stoops
with
one
foot
set
firm
they
turn
and
wind
to
lay
on
strokes
or
to
dodge
them
at
last
rinaldo
throwing
himself
on
the
circassian
dealt
him
a
blow
so
terrible
that
fusberta
his
good
sword
cut
in
two
the
buckler
of
sacripant
although
it
was
made
of
bone
and
covered
with
a
thick
plate
of
steel
well
tempered
the
arm
of
the
saracen
was
deprived
of
its
defence
and
almost
palsied
with
the
stroke
angelica
perceiving
how
victory
was
likely
to
incline
and
shuddering
at
the
thought
of
becoming
the
prize
of
rinaldo
hesitated
no
longer
turning
her
horse
head
she
fled
with
the
utmost
speed
and
in
spite
of
the
round
pebbles
which
covered
a
steep
descent
she
plunged
into
a
deep
valley
trembling
with
the
fear
that
rinaldo
was
in
pursuit
at
the
bottom
of
this
valley
she
encountered
an
aged
hermit
whose
white
beard
flowed
to
his
middle
and
whose
venerable
appearance
seemed
to
assure
his
piety
this
hermit
who
appeared
shrunk
by
age
and
fasting
travelled
slowly
mounted
upon
a
wretched
ass
the
princess
overcome
with
fear
conjured
him
to
save
her
life
and
to
conduct
her
to
some
port
of
the
sea
whence
she
might
embark
and
quit
france
never
more
to
hear
the
odious
name
of
rinaldo
the
old
hermit
was
something
of
a
wizard
he
comforted
angelica
and
promised
to
protect
her
from
all
peril
then
he
opened
his
scrip
and
took
from
thence
a
book
and
had
read
but
a
single
page
when
a
goblin
obedient
to
his
incantations
appeared
under
the
form
of
a
laboring
man
and
demanded
his
orders
he
received
them
transported
himself
to
the
place
where
the
knights
still
maintained
their
conflict
and
boldly
stepped
between
the
two
tell
me
i
pray
you
he
said
what
benefit
will
accrue
to
him
who
shall
get
the
better
in
this
contest
the
object
you
are
contending
for
is
already
disposed
of
for
the
paladin
orlando
without
effort
and
without
opposition
is
now
carrying
away
the
princess
angelica
to
paris
you
had
better
pursue
them
promptly
for
if
they
reach
paris
you
will
never
see
her
again
at
these
words
you
might
have
seen
those
rival
warriors
confounded
stupefied
silently
agreeing
that
they
were
affording
their
rival
a
fair
opportunity
to
triumph
over
them
rinaldo
approaching
bayard
breathes
a
sigh
of
shame
and
rage
and
swears
a
terrible
oath
that
if
he
overtakes
orlando
he
will
tear
his
heart
out
then
mounting
bayard
and
pressing
his
flanks
with
his
spurs
he
leaves
the
king
of
circassia
on
foot
in
the
forest
let
it
not
appear
strange
that
rinaldo
found
bayard
obedient
at
last
after
having
so
long
prevented
any
one
from
even
touching
his
bridle
for
that
fine
animal
had
an
intelligence
almost
human
he
had
fled
from
his
master
only
to
draw
him
on
the
track
of
angelica
and
enable
him
to
recover
her
he
saw
when
the
princess
fled
from
the
battle
and
rinaldo
being
then
engaged
in
a
fight
on
foot
bayard
found
himself
free
to
follow
the
traces
of
angelica
thus
he
had
drawn
his
master
after
him
not
permitting
him
to
approach
and
had
brought
him
to
the
sight
of
the
princess
but
bayard
now
deceived
like
his
master
with
the
false
intelligence
of
the
goblin
submits
to
be
mounted
and
to
serve
his
master
as
usual
and
rinaldo
animated
with
rage
makes
him
fly
toward
paris
more
slowly
than
his
wishes
though
the
speed
of
bayard
outstripped
the
winds
full
of
impatience
to
encounter
orlando
he
gave
but
a
few
hours
that
night
to
sleep
early
the
next
day
he
saw
before
him
the
great
city
under
the
walls
of
which
the
emperor
charles
had
collected
the
scattered
remains
of
his
army
foreseeing
that
he
would
soon
be
attacked
on
all
sides
the
emperor
had
caused
the
ancient
fortifications
to
be
repaired
and
new
ones
to
be
built
surrounded
by
wide
and
deep
ditches
the
desire
to
hold
the
field
against
the
enemy
made
him
seize
every
means
of
procuring
new
allies
he
hoped
to
receive
from
england
aid
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
form
a
new
camp
and
as
soon
as
rinaldo
rejoined
him
he
selected
him
to
go
as
his
ambassador
into
england
to
plead
for
auxiliaries
rinaldo
was
far
from
pleased
with
his
commission
but
he
obeyed
the
emperor
commands
without
giving
himself
time
to
devote
a
single
day
to
the
object
nearest
his
heart
he
hastened
to
calais
and
lost
not
a
moment
in
embarking
for
england
ardently
desiring
a
hasty
despatch
of
his
commission
and
a
speedy
return
to
france
bradamante
and
rogero
bradamante
the
knight
of
the
white
plume
and
shield
whose
sudden
appearance
and
encounter
with
sacripant
we
have
already
told
was
in
quest
of
rogero
from
whom
chance
had
separated
her
almost
at
the
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
after
her
encounter
with
sacripant
bradamante
pursued
her
way
through
the
forest
in
hopes
of
rejoining
rogero
and
arrived
at
last
on
the
brink
of
a
fair
fountain
this
fountain
flowed
through
a
broad
meadow
ancient
trees
overshadowed
it
and
travellers
attracted
by
the
sweet
murmur
of
its
waters
stopped
there
to
cool
themselves
bradamante
casting
her
eyes
on
all
sides
to
enjoy
the
beauties
of
the
spot
perceived
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
a
knight
reclining
who
seemed
to
be
oppressed
with
the
deepest
grief
bradamante
accosted
him
and
asked
to
be
informed
of
the
cause
of
his
distress
alas
my
lord
said
he
i
lament
a
young
and
charming
friend
my
affianced
wife
who
has
been
torn
from
me
by
a
villain
let
me
rather
call
him
a
demon
who
on
a
winged
horse
descended
from
the
air
seized
her
and
bore
her
screaming
to
his
den
i
have
pursued
them
over
rocks
and
through
ravines
till
my
horse
is
no
longer
able
to
bear
me
and
i
now
wait
only
for
death
he
added
that
already
a
vain
attempt
on
his
behalf
had
been
made
by
two
knights
whom
chance
had
brought
to
the
spot
their
names
were
gradasso
king
of
sericane
and
rogero
the
moor
both
had
been
overcome
by
the
wiles
of
the
enchanter
and
were
added
to
the
number
of
the
captives
whom
he
held
in
an
impregnable
castle
situated
on
the
height
of
the
mountain
at
the
mention
of
rogero
name
bradamante
started
with
delight
which
was
soon
changed
to
an
opposite
sentiment
when
she
heard
that
her
lover
was
a
prisoner
in
the
toils
of
the
enchanter
sir
knight
she
said
do
not
surrender
yourself
to
despair
this
day
may
be
more
happy
for
you
than
you
think
if
you
will
only
lead
me
to
the
castle
which
enfolds
her
whom
you
deplore
the
knight
responded
after
having
lost
all
that
made
life
dear
to
me
i
have
no
motive
to
avoid
the
dangers
of
the
enterprise
and
i
will
do
as
you
request
but
i
forewarn
you
of
the
perils
you
will
have
to
encounter
if
you
fall
impute
it
not
to
me
having
thus
spoken
they
took
their
way
to
the
castle
but
were
overtaken
by
a
messenger
from
the
camp
who
had
been
sent
in
quest
of
bradamante
to
summon
her
back
to
the
army
where
her
presence
was
needed
to
reassure
her
disheartened
forces
and
withstand
the
advance
of
the
moors
the
mournful
knight
whose
name
was
pinabel
thus
became
aware
that
bradamante
was
a
scion
of
the
house
of
clermont
between
which
and
his
own
of
mayence
there
existed
an
ancient
feud
from
this
moment
the
traitor
sought
only
how
he
might
be
rid
of
the
company
of
bradamante
from
whom
he
feared
no
good
would
come
to
him
but
rather
mortal
injury
if
his
name
and
lineage
became
known
to
her
for
he
judged
her
by
his
own
base
model
and
knowing
his
ill
deserts
he
feared
to
receive
his
due
bradamante
in
spite
of
the
summons
to
return
to
the
army
could
not
resolve
to
leave
her
lover
in
captivity
and
determined
first
to
finish
the
adventure
on
which
she
was
engaged
pinabel
leading
the
way
they
at
length
arrived
at
a
wood
in
the
centre
of
which
rose
a
steep
rocky
mountain
pinabel
who
now
thought
of
nothing
else
but
how
he
might
escape
from
bradamante
proposed
to
ascend
the
mountain
to
extend
his
view
in
order
to
discover
a
shelter
for
the
night
if
any
there
might
be
within
sight
under
this
pretence
he
left
bradamante
and
advanced
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
till
he
came
to
a
cleft
in
the
rock
down
which
he
looked
and
perceived
that
it
widened
below
into
a
spacious
cavern
meanwhile
bradamante
fearful
of
losing
her
guide
had
followed
close
on
his
footsteps
and
rejoined
him
at
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
then
the
traitor
seeing
the
impossibility
of
escaping
her
conceived
another
design
he
told
her
that
before
her
approach
he
had
seen
in
the
cavern
a
young
and
beautiful
damsel
whose
rich
dress
announced
her
high
birth
who
with
tears
and
lamentations
implored
assistance
that
before
he
could
descend
to
relieve
her
a
ruffian
had
seized
her
and
hurried
her
away
into
the
recesses
of
the
cavern
bradamante
full
of
truth
and
courage
readily
believed
this
lie
of
the
mayencian
traitor
eager
to
succor
the
damsel
she
looked
round
for
the
means
of
facilitating
the
descent
and
seeing
a
large
elm
with
spreading
branches
she
lopped
off
with
her
sword
one
of
the
largest
and
thrust
it
into
the
opening
she
told
pinabel
to
hold
fast
to
the
larger
end
while
grasping
the
branches
with
her
hands
she
let
herself
down
into
the
cavern
the
traitor
smiled
at
seeing
her
thus
suspended
and
asking
her
in
mockery
are
you
a
good
leaper
he
let
go
the
branch
with
perfidious
glee
and
saw
bradamante
precipitated
to
the
bottom
of
the
cave
i
wish
your
whole
race
were
there
with
you
he
muttered
that
you
might
all
perish
together
but
pinabel
atrocious
design
was
not
accomplished
the
twigs
and
foliage
of
the
branch
broke
its
descent
and
bradamante
not
seriously
injured
though
stunned
with
her
fall
was
reserved
for
other
adventures
as
soon
as
she
recovered
from
the
shock
bradamante
cast
her
eyes
around
and
perceived
a
door
through
which
she
passed
into
a
second
cavern
larger
and
loftier
than
the
first
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
subterranean
temple
columns
of
the
purest
alabaster
adorned
it
and
supported
the
roof
a
simple
altar
rose
in
the
middle
a
lamp
whose
radiance
was
reflected
by
the
alabaster
walls
cast
a
mild
light
around
bradamante
inspired
by
a
sense
of
religious
awe
approached
the
altar
and
falling
on
her
knees
poured
forth
her
prayers
and
thanks
to
the
preserver
of
her
life
invoking
the
protection
of
his
power
at
that
moment
a
small
door
opened
and
a
female
issued
from
it
with
naked
feet
and
flowing
robe
and
hair
who
called
her
by
her
name
and
thus
addressed
her
brave
and
generous
bradamante
know
that
it
is
a
power
from
above
that
has
brought
you
hither
the
spirit
of
merlin
whose
last
earthly
abode
was
in
this
place
has
warned
me
of
your
arrival
and
of
the
fate
that
awaits
you
this
famous
grotto
she
continued
was
the
work
of
the
enchanter
merlin
here
his
ashes
repose
you
have
no
doubt
heard
how
this
sage
and
virtuous
enchanter
ceased
to
be
victim
of
the
artful
fairy
of
the
lake
merlin
by
a
fatal
compliance
with
her
request
laid
himself
down
living
in
his
tomb
without
power
to
resist
the
spell
laid
upon
him
by
that
ingrate
who
retained
him
there
as
long
as
he
lived
his
spirit
hovers
about
this
spot
and
will
not
leave
it
until
the
last
trumpet
shall
summon
the
dead
to
judgment
he
answers
the
questions
of
those
who
approach
his
tomb
where
perhaps
you
may
be
privileged
to
hear
his
voice
bradamante
astonished
at
these
words
and
the
objects
which
met
her
view
knew
not
whether
she
was
awake
or
asleep
confused
but
modest
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
a
blush
overspread
her
face
ah
what
am
i
said
she
that
so
great
a
prophet
should
deign
to
speak
to
me
still
with
a
secret
satisfaction
she
followed
the
priestess
who
led
her
to
the
tomb
of
merlin
this
tomb
was
constructed
of
a
species
of
stone
hard
and
resplendent
like
fire
the
rays
which
beamed
from
the
stone
sufficed
to
light
up
that
terrible
place
where
the
sun
rays
never
penetrated
but
i
know
not
whether
that
light
was
the
effect
of
a
certain
phosphorescence
of
the
stone
itself
or
of
the
many
talismans
and
charms
with
which
it
was
wrought
over
bradamante
had
hardly
passed
the
threshold
of
this
sacred
place
when
the
spirit
of
the
enchanter
saluted
her
with
a
voice
firm
and
distinct
may
thy
designs
be
prosperous
o
chaste
and
noble
maiden
the
future
mother
of
heroes
the
glory
of
italy
and
destined
to
fill
the
whole
world
with
their
fame
great
captains
renowned
knights
shall
be
numbered
among
your
descendants
who
shall
defend
the
church
and
restore
their
country
to
its
ancient
splendor
princes
wise
as
augustus
and
the
sage
numa
shall
bring
back
the
age

in
her
future
course

she
i
will
conduct
you
to
the
castle
on
the
rock
where
rogero
is
held
captive
i
will
not
leave
you
till
i
have
guided
you
through
this
wild
wood
and
i
will
direct

way
so
that
you
shall
be
in
no

of

the
next
morning
melissa
conducted
bradamante
between
rocks
and
precipices
crossing
rapid
torrents
and
traversing
intricate
passes
employing
the
time
in
imparting
to
her
such
information
as
was
necessary
to
enable
her
to
bring
her
design
to
a
successful
issue
not
only
would
the
castle
impenetrable
by
force
and
that
winged
horse
of
his
baffle
your
efforts
but
know
that
he
possesses
also
a
buckler
whence
flashes
a
light
so
brilliant
that
the
eyes
of
all
who
look
upon
it
are
blinded
think
not
to
avoid
it
by
shutting
your
eyes
for
how
then
will
you
be
able
to
avoid
his
blows
and
make
him
feel
your
own
but
i
will
teach
you
the
proper
course
to
pursue
agramant
the
moorish
prince
possesses
a
ring
stolen
from
a
queen
of
india
which
has
power
to
render
of
no
avail
all
enchantments
agramant
knowing
that
rogero
is
of
more
importance
to
him
than
any
one
of
his
warriors
is
desirous
of
rescuing
him
from
the
power
of
the
enchanter
and
has
sent
for
that
purpose
brunello
the
most
crafty
and
sagacious
of
his
servants
provided
with
his
wonderful
ring
and
he
is
even
now
at
hand
bent
on
this
enterprise
but
beautiful
bradamante
as
i
desire
that
no
one
but
yourself
shall
have
the
glory
of
delivering
from
thraldom
your
future
spouse
listen
while
i
disclose
the
means
of
success
following
this
path
which
leads
by
the
seashore
you
will
come
ere
long
to
a
hostelry
where
the
saracen
brunello
will
arrive
shortly
before
you
you
will
readily
know
him
by
his
stature
under
four
feet
his
great
disproportioned
head
his
squint
eyes
his
livid
hue
his
thick
eyebrows
joining
his
tufted
beard
his
dress
moreover
that
of
a
courier
will
point
him
out
to
you
it
will
be
easy
for
you
to
enter
into
conversation
with
him
announcing
yourself
as
a
knight
seeking
combat
with
the
enchanter
but
let
not
the
knave
suspect
that
you
know
anything
about
the
ring
i
doubt
not
that
he
will
be
your
guide
to
the
castle
of
the
enchanter
accept
his
offer
but
take
care
to
keep
behind
him
till
you
come
in
sight
of
the
brilliant
dome
of
the
castle
then
hesitate
not
to
strike
him
dead
for
the
wretch
deserves
no
pity
and
take
from
him
the
ring
but
let
him
not
suspect
your
intention
for
by
putting
the
ring
into
his
mouth
he
will
instantly
become
invisible
and
disappear
from
your
eyes
saying
thus
the
sage
melissa
and
the
fair
bradamante
arrived
near
the
city
of
bordeaux
where
the
rich
and
wide
river
garonne
pours
the
tribute
of
its
waves
into
the
sea
they
parted
with
tender
embraces
bradamante
intent
wholly
on
her
purpose
hastened
to
arrive
at
the
hostelry
where
brunello
had
preceded
her
a
few
moments
only
the
young
heroine
knew
him
without
difficulty
she
accosted
him
and
put
to
him
some
slight
questions
to
which
he
replied
with
adroit
falsehoods
bradamante
on
her
part
concealed
from
him
her
sex
her
religion
her
country
and
the
blood
from
whence
she
sprung
while
they
talk
together
sudden
cries
are
heard
from
all
parts
of
the
hostelry
o
queen
of
heaven
exclaimed
bradamante
what
can
be
the
cause
of
this
sudden
alarm
she
soon
learned
the
cause
host
children
domestics
all
with
upturned
eyes
as
if
they
saw
a
comet
or
a
great
eclipse
were
gazing
on
a
prodigy
which
seemed
to
pass
the
bounds
of
possibility
she
beheld
distinctly
a
winged
horse
mounted
with
a
cavalier
in
rich
armor
cleaving
the
air
with
rapid
flight
the
wings
of
this
strange
courser
were
wide
extended
and
covered
with
feathers
of
various
colors
the
polished
armor
of
the
knight
made
them
shine
with
rainbow
tints
in
a
short
time
the
horse
and
rider
disappeared
behind
the
summits
of
the
mountains
it
is
an
enchanter
said
the
host
a
magician
who
often
is
seen
traversing
the
air
in
that
way
sometimes
he
flies
aloft
as
if
among
the
stars
and
at
others
skims
along
the
land
he
possesses
a
wonderful
castle
on
the
top
of
the
pyrenees
many
knights
have
shown
their
courage
by
going
to
attack
him
but
none
have
ever
returned
from
which
it
is
to
be
feared
they
have
lost
either
their
life
or
their
liberty
bradamante
addressing
the
host
said
could
you
furnish
me
a
guide
to
conduct
me
to
the
castle
of
this
enchanter
by
my
faith
said
brunello
interrupting
that
you
shall
not
seek
in
vain
i
have
it
all
in
writing
and
i
will
myself
conduct
you
bradamante
with
thanks
accepted
him
for
her
guide
the
host
had
a
tolerable
horse
to
dispose
of
which
bradamante
bargained
for
and
the
next
day
at
the
first
dawn
of
morning
she
took
her
route
by
a
narrow
valley
taking
care
to
have
the
saracen
brunello
lead
the
way
they
reached
the
summit
of
the
pyrenees
whence
one
may
look
down
on
france
spain
and
the
two
seas
from
this
height
they
descended
again
by
a
fatiguing
road
into
a
deep
valley
from
the
middle
of
this
valley
an
isolated
mountain
rose
composed
of
rough
and
perpendicular
rock
on
whose
summit
was
the
castle
surrounded
with
a
wall
of
brass
brunello
said
yonder
is
the
stronghold
where
the
enchanter
keeps
his
prisoners
one
must
have
wings
to
mount
thither
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
aid
of
a
flying
horse
must
be
necessary
for
the
master
of
this
castle
which
he
uses
for
his
prison
and
for
his
abode
bradamante
sufficiently
instructed
saw
that
the
time
had
now
come
to
possess
herself
of
the
ring
but
she
could
not
resolve
to
slay
a
defenceless
man
she
seized
brunello
before
he
was
aware
bound
him
to
a
tree
and
took
from
him
the
ring
which
he
wore
on
one
of
his
fingers
the
cries
and
entreaties
of
the
perfidious
saracen
moved
her
not
she
advanced
to
the
foot
of
the
rock
whereon
the
castle
stood
and
to
draw
the
magician
to
the
combat
sounded
her
horn
adding
to
it
cries
of
defiance
the
enchanter
delayed
not
to
present
himself
mounted
on
his
winged
horse
bradamante
was
struck
with
surprise
mixed
with
joy
when
she
saw
that
this
person
described
as
so
formidable
bore
no
lance
nor
club
nor
any
other
deadly
weapon
he
had
only
on
his
arm
a
buckler
covered
with
a
cloth
and
in
his
hand
an
open
book
as
to
the
winged
horse
there
was
no
enchantment
about
him
he
was
a
natural
animal
of
a
species
which
exists
in
the
riphaean
mountains
like
a
griffin
he
had
the
head
of
an
eagle
claws
armed
with
talons
and
wings
covered
with
feathers
the
rest
of
his
body
being
that
of
a
horse
this
strange
animal
is
called
a
hippogriff
the
heroine
attacked
the
enchanter
on
his
approach
striking
on
this
side
and
on
that
with
all
the
energy
of
a
violent
combat
but
wounding
only
the
wind
and
after
this
pretended
attack
had
lasted
some
time
dismounted
from
her
horse
as
if
hoping
to
do
battle
more
effectually
on
foot
the
enchanter
now
prepares
to
employ
his
sole
weapon
by
uncovering
the
magic
buckler
which
never
failed
to
subdue
an
enemy
by
depriving
him
of
his
senses
bradamante
confiding
in
her
ring
observed
all
the
motions
of
her
adversary
and
at
the
unveiling
of
the
shield
cast
herself
on
the
ground
pretending
that
the
splendor
of
the
shield
had
overcome
her
but
in
reality
to
induce
the
enchanter
to
dismount
and
approach
her
it
happened
according
to
her
wish
when
the
enchanter
saw
her
prostrate
he
made
his
horse
alight
on
the
ground
and
dismounting
fixed
the
shield
on
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
and
approached
in
order
to
secure
the
fallen
warrior
bradamante
who
watched
him
intently
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
near
at
hand
sprang
up
seized
him
vigorously
threw
him
down
and
with
the
same
chain
which
the
enchanter
had
prepared
for
herself
bound
him
fast
without
his
being
able
to
make
any
effectual
resistance
the
enchanter
with
the
accents
of
despair
exclaimed
take
my
life
young
man
but
bradamante
was
far
from
complying
with
such
a
wish
desirous
of
knowing
the
name
of
the
enchanter
and
for
what
purpose
he
had
formed
with
so
much
art
this
impregnable
fortress
she
commanded
him
to
inform
her
alas
replied
the
magician
while
tears
flowed
down
his
cheeks
it
is
not
to
conceal
booty
nor
for
any
culpable
design
that
i
have
built
this
castle
it
was
only
to
guard
the
life
of
a
young
knight
the
object
of
my
tenderest
affection
my
art
having
taught
me
that
he
is
destined
to
become
a
christian
and
to
perish
shortly
after
by
the
blackest
of
treasons
this
youth
named
rogero
is
the
most
beautiful
and
most
accomplished
of
knights
it
is
i
the
unhappy
atlantes
who
have
reared
him
from
his
childhood
the
call
of
honor
and
the
desire
of
glory
led
him
from
me
to
follow
agramant
his
prince
in
his
invasion
of
france
and
i
more
devoted
to
rogero
than
the
tenderest
of
parents
have
sought
the
means
of
bringing
him
back
to
this
abode
in
the
hope
of
saving
him
from
the
cruel
fate
that
menaces
him
for
this
purpose
i
have
got
him
in
my
possession
by
the
same
means
as
i
attempted
to
employ
against
you
and
by
which
i
have
succeeded
in
collecting
a
great
many
knights
and
ladies
in
my
castle
my
purpose
was
to
render
my
beloved
pupil
captivity
light
by
affording
him
society
to
amuse
him
and
keep
his
thoughts
from
running
on
subjects
of
war
and
glory
alas
my
cares
have
been
in
vain
yet
take
i
beseech
you
whatever
else
i
have
but
spare
me
my
beloved
pupil
take
this
shield
take
this
winged
courser
deliver
such
of
your
friends
as
you
may
find
among
my
prisoners
deliver
them
all
if
you
will
but
leave
me
my
beloved
rogero
or
if
you
will
snatch
him
too
from
me
take
also
my
life
which
will
cease
then
to
be
to
me
worth
preserving
bradamante
replied
old
man
hope
not
to
move
me
by
your
vain
entreaties
it
is
precisely
the
liberty
of
rogero
that
i
require
you
would
keep
him
here
in
bondage
and
in
slothful
pleasure
to
save
him
from
a
fate
which
you
foresee
vain
old
man
how
can
you
foresee
his
fate
when
you
could
not
foresee
your
own
you
desire
me
to
take
your
life
no
my
aim
and
my
soul
refuse
the
request
this
said
she
required
the
magician
to
go
before
and
guide
her
to
the
castle
the
prisoners
were
set
at
liberty
though
some
in
their
secret
hearts
regretted
the
voluptuous
life
which
was
thus
brought
to
an
end
bradamante
and
rogero
met
one
another
with
transports
of
joy
they
descended
from
the
mountain
to
the
spot
where
the
encounter
had
taken
place
there
they
found
the
hippogriff
with
the
magic
buckler
in
its
wrapper
hanging
to
his
bradamante
advanced
to
seize
the
bridle
the
hippogriff
seemed
to
wait
her
approach
but
before
she
reached
him
he
spread
his
wings
and
flew
away
to
a
neighboring
hill
and
in
the
same
manner
a
second
time
eluded
her
efforts
rogero
and
the
other
liberated
knights
dispersed
over
the
plain
and
hilltops
to
secure
him
and
at
last
the
animal
allowed
rogero
to
seize
his
rein
the
fearless
rogero
hesitated
not
to
vault
upon
his
back
and
let
him
feel
his
spurs
which
so
roused
his
mettle
that
after
galloping
a
short
distance
he
suddenly
spread
his
wings
and
soared
into
the
air
bradamante
had
the
grief
to
see
her
lover
snatched
away
from
her
at
the
very
moment
of
reunion
rogero
who
knew
not
the
art
of
directing
the
horse
was
unable
to
control
his
flight
he
found
himself
carried
over
the
tops
of
the
mountains
so
far
above
them
that
he
could
hardly
distinguish
what
was
land
and
what
water
the
hippogriff
directed
his
flight
to
the
west
and
cleaved
the
air
as
swiftly
as
a
vessel
cuts
the
waves
impelled
by
the
freshest
and
most
favorable
gales
astolpho
and
the
enchantress
in
the
long
flight
which
rogero
took
on
the
back
of
the
hippogriff
he
was
carried
over
land
and
sea
unknowing
whither
as
soon
as
he
had
gained
some
control
over
the
animal
he
made
him
alight
on
the
nearest
land
when
he
came
near
enough
to
earth
rogero
leapt
lightly
from
his
back
and
tied
the
animal
to
a
near
the
spot
flowed
the
pure
waters
of
a
fountain
surrounded
by
cedars
and
rogero
laid
aside
his
shield
and
removing
his
helmet
breathed
with
delight
the
fresh
air
and
cooled
his
lips
with
the
waters
of
the
fountain
for
we
can
not
wonder
that
he
was
excessively
fatigued
considering
the
ride
he
had
taken
he
was
preparing
to
taste
the
sweets
of
repose
when
he
perceived
that
the
hippogriff
which
he
had
tied
by
the
bridle
to
a
frightened
at
something
was
making
violent
efforts
to
disengage
himself
his
struggle
shook
the
so
that
many
of
its
beautiful
leaves
were
torn
off
and
strewed
the
ground
a
sound
like
that
which
issues
from
burning
wood
seemed
to
come
from
the
at
first
faint
and
indistinct
but
growing
stronger
by
degrees
and
at
length
was
audible
as
a
voice
which
spoke
in
this
manner
o
knight
if
the
tenderness
of
your
heart
corresponds
to
the
beauty
of
your
person
relieve
me
i
pray
you
from
this
tormenting
animal
i
suffer
enough
inwardly
without
having
outward
evils
added
to
my
lot
rogero
at
the
first
accents
of
this
voice
turned
his
eyes
promptly
on
the
myrtle
hastened
to
it
and
stood
fixed
in
astonishment
when
he
perceived
that
the
voice
issued
from
the
tree
itself
he
immediately
untied
his
horse
and
flushed
with
surprise
and
regret
exclaimed
whoever
thou
art
whether
mortal
or
the
goddess
of
these
woods
forgive
me
i
beseech
you
my
involuntary
fault
had
i
imagined
that
this
hard
bark
covered
a
being
possessed
of
feeling
could
i
have
exposed
such
a
beautiful
myrtle
to
the
insults
of
this
steed
may
the
sweet
influences
of
the
sky
and
air
speedily
repair
the
injury
i
have
done
for
my
part
i
promise
by
the
sovereign
lady
of
my
heart
to
do
everything
you
wish
in
order
to
merit
your
forgiveness
at
these
words
the
myrtle
seemed
to
tremble
from
root
to
stem
and
rogero
remarked
that
a
moisture
as
of
tears
trickled
down
its
bark
like
that
which
exudes
from
a
log
placed
on
the
fire
it
then
spoke
the
kindness
which
inspires
your
words
compels
me
to
disclose
to
you
who
i
once
was
and
by
what
fatality
i
have
been
changed
into
this
shape
my
name
was
astolpho
cousin
of
orlando
and
rinaldo
whose
fame
has
filled
the
earth
i
was
myself
reckoned
among
the
bravest
paladins
of
france
and
was
by
birth
entitled
to
reign
over
england
after
otho
my
father
returning
from
the
distant
east
with
rinaldo
and
many
other
brave
knights
called
home
to
aid
with
our
arms
the
great
emperor
of
france
we
reached
a
spot
where
the
powerful
enchantress
alcina
possessed
a
castle
on
the
borders
of
the
sea
she
had
gone
to
the
to
amuse
herself
with
fishing
and
we
paused
to
see
how
by
her
art
without
hook
or
line
she
drew
from
the
water
whatever
she
would
not
far
from
the
shore
an
enormous
whale
showed
a
back
so
broad
and
motionless
that
it
looked
like
an
island
alcina
had
fixed
her
eyes
on
me
and
planned
to
get
me
into
her
power
addressing
us
she
said
is
the
hour
when
the
prettiest
mermaid
in
the
sea
comes
regularly
every
day
to
the
shore
of
yonder
island
she
sings
so
sweetly
that
the
very
waves
flow
smoother
at
the
sound
if
you
wish
to
hear
her
come
with
me
to
her
resort
so
saying
alcina
pointed
to
the
fish
which
we
all
supposed
to
be
an
island
i
who
was
rash
did
not
hesitate
to
follow
her
but
swam
my
horse
over
and
mounted
on
the
back
of
the
fish
in
vain
rinaldo
and
dudon
made
signs
to
me
to
beware
alcina
smiling
took
me
in
charge
and
led
the
way
no
sooner
were
we
mounted
upon
him
than
the
whale
moved
off
spreading
his
great
fins
and
cleft
rapidly
the
waters
i
then
saw
my
folly
but
it
was
too
late
to
repent
alcina
soothed
my
anger
and
professed
that
what
she
had
done
was
for
love
of
me
ere
long
we
arrived
at
this
island
where
at
first
everything
was
done
to
reconcile
me
to
my
lot
and
to
make
my
days
pass
happily
away
but
soon
alcina
sated
with
her
conquest
grew
indifferent
then
weary
of
me
and
at
last
to
get
rid
of
me
changed
me
into
this
form
as
she
had
done
to
many
lovers
before
me
making
some
of
them
olives
some
palms
some
cedars
changing
others
into
fountains
rocks
or
even
into
wild
beasts
and
thou
courteous
knight
whom
accident
has
brought
to
this
enchanted
isle
beware
that
she
get
not
the
power
over
thee
or
thou
shalt
haply
be
made
like
us
a
tree
a
fountain
or
a
rock
rogero
expressed
his
astonishment
at
this
recital
astolpho
added
that
the
island
was
in
great
part
subject
to
the
sway
of
alcina
by
the
aid
of
her
sister
morgana
she
had
succeeded
in
dispossessing
a
third
sister
logestilla
of
nearly
the
whole
of
her
patrimony
for
the
whole
isle
was
hers
originally
by
her
father
bequest
but
logestilla
was
temperate
and
sage
while
the
other
sisters
were
false
and
voluptuous
her
empire
was
divided
from
theirs
by
a
gulf
and
chain
of
mountains
which
alone
had
thus
far
prevented
her
sister
from
usurping
it
astolpho
here
ended
his
tale
and
rogero
who
knew
that
he
was
the
cousin
of
bradamante
would
gladly
have
devised
some
way
for
his
relief
but
as
that
was
out
of
his
power
he
consoled
him
as
well
as
he
could
and
then
begged
to
be
told
the
way
to
the
palace
of
logestilla
and
how
to
avoid
that
of
alcina
astolpho
directed
him
to
take
the
road
to
the
left
though
rough
and
full
of
rocks
he
warned
him
that
this
road
would
present
serious
obstacles
that
troops
of
monsters
would
oppose
his
passage
employed
by
the
art
of
alcina
to
prevent
her
subjects
from
escaping
from
her
dominion
rogero
thanked
the
myrtle
and
prepared
to
set
out
on
his
way
he
at
first
thought
he
would
mount
the
winged
horse
and
scale
the
mountain
on
his
back
but
he
was
too
uncertain
of
his
power
to
control
him
to
wish
to
encounter
the
hazard
of
another
flight
through
the
air
besides
that
he
was
almost
famished
for
the
want
of
food
so
he
led
the
horse
after
him
and
took
the
road
on
foot
which
for
some
distance
led
equally
to
the
dominions
of
both
the
sisters
he
had
not
advanced
more
than
two
miles
when
he
saw
before
him
the
superb
city
of
alcina
it
was
surrounded
with
a
wall
of
gold
which
seemed
to
reach
the
skies
i
know
that
some
think
that
this
wall
was
not
of
real
gold
but
only
the
work
of
alchemy
it
matters
not
i
prefer
to
think
it
gold
for
it
certainly
shone
like
gold
a
broad
and
level
road
led
to
the
gates
of
the
city
and
from
this
another
branched
off
narrow
and
rough
which
led
to
the
mountain
region
rogero
took
without
hesitation
the
narrow
road
but
he
had
no
sooner
entered
upon
it
than
he
was
assailed
by
a
numerous
troop
which
opposed
his
passage
you
never
have
seen
anything
so
ridiculous
so
extraordinary
as
this
host
of
hobgoblins
were
some
of
them
bore
the
human
form
from
the
neck
to
the
feet
but
had
the
head
of
a
monkey
or
a
cat
others
had
the
legs
and
the
ears
of
a
horse
old
men
and
women
bald
and
hideous
ran
hither
and
thither
as
if
out
of
their
senses
half
clad
in
the
shaggy
skins
of
beasts
one
rode
full
speed
on
a
horse
without
a
bridle
another
jogged
along
mounted
on
an
ass
or
a
cow
others
full
of
agility
skipped
about
and
clung
to
the
tails
and
manes
of
the
animals
which
their
companions
rode
some
blew
horns
others
brandished
some
were
armed
with
spits
and
some
with
pitchforks
one
who
appeared
to
be
the
captain
had
an
enormous
belly
and
a
gross
fat
head
he
was
mounted
on
a
tortoise
that
waddled
now
this
way
now
that
without
keeping
any
one
direction
one
of
these
monsters
who
had
something
approaching
the
human
form
though
he
had
the
neck
ears
and
muzzle
of
a
dog
set
himself
to
bark
furiously
at
rogero
to
make
him
turn
off
to
the
right
and
reenter
upon
the
road
to
the
gay
city
but
the
brave
chevalier
exclaimed
that
will
i
not
so
long
as
i
can
use
this
sword
and
he
thrust
the
point
directly
at
his
face
the
monster
tried
to
strike
him
with
a
lance
but
rogero
was
too
quick
for
him
and
thrust
his
sword
through
his
body
so
that
it
appeared
a
hand
breadth
behind
his
back
the
paladin
now
giving
full
vent
to
his
rage
laid
about
him
vigorously
among
the
rabble
cleaving
one
to
the
teeth
another
to
the
girdle
but
the
troop
were
so
numerous
and
in
spite
of
his
blows
pressed
around
him
so
close
that
to
clear
his
way
he
must
have
had
as
many
arms
as
briareus
if
rogero
had
uncovered
the
shield
of
the
enchanter
which
hung
at
his
he
might
easily
have
vanquished
this
monstrous
rout
but
perhaps
he
did
not
think
of
it
and
perhaps
he
preferred
to
seek
his
defence
nowhere
but
in
his
good
sword
at
that
moment
when
his
perplexity
was
at
its
height
he
saw
issue
from
the
city
gate
two
young
beauties
whose
air
and
dress
proclaimed
their
rank
and
gentle
nurture
each
of
them
was
mounted
on
a
unicorn
whose
whiteness
surpassed
that
of
ermine
they
advanced
to
the
meadow
where
rogero
was
contending
so
valiantly
against
the
hobgoblins
who
all
retired
at
their
approach
they
drew
near
they
extended
their
hands
to
the
young
warrior
whose
cheeks
glowed
with
the
flush
of
exercise
and
modesty
grateful
for
their
assistance
he
expressed
his
thanks
and
having
no
heart
to
refuse
them
followed
their
guidance
to
the
gate
of
the
city
this
grand
and
beautiful
entrance
was
adorned
by
a
portico
of
four
vast
columns
all
of
diamond
whether
they
were
real
diamond
or
artificial
i
can
not
say
what
matter
is
it
so
long
as
they
appeared
to
the
eye
like
diamond
and
nothing
could
be
more
gay
and
splendid
on
the
threshold
and
between
the
columns
was
seen
a
bevy
of
charming
young
women
who
played
and
frolicked
together
they
all
ran
to
receive
rogero
and
conducted
him
into
the
palace
which
appeared
like
a
paradise
we
might
well
call
by
that
name
this
abode
where
the
hours
flew
by
without
account
in
delights
the
bare
idea
of
satiety
want
and
above
all
of
age
never
entered
the
minds
of
the
inhabitants
they
experienced
no
sensations
except
those
of
luxury
and
gayety
the
cup
of
happiness
seemed
for
them
flowing
and
exhaustless
the
two
young
damsels
to
whom
rogero
owed
his
deliverance
from
the
hobgoblins
conducted
him
to
the
apartment
of
their
mistress
the
beautiful
alcina
advanced
and
greeted
him
with
an
air
at
once
dignified
and
courteous
all
her
court
surrounded
the
paladin
and
rendered
him
the
most
flattering
attentions
the
castle
was
less
admirable
for
its
magnificence
than
for
the
charms
of
those
who
inhabited
it
they
were
of
either
sex
well
matched
in
beauty
youth
and
grace
but
among
this
charming
group
the
brilliant
alcina
shone
as
the
sun
outshines
the
stars
the
young
warrior
was
fascinated
all
that
he
had
heard
from
the
appeared
to
him
but
a
vile
calumny
how
could
he
suspect
that
falsehood
and
treason
veiled
themselves
under
smiles
and
the
ingenuous
air
of
truth
he
doubted
not
that
astolpho
had
deserved
his
fate
and
perhaps
a
punishment
more
severe
he
regarded
all
his
stories
as
dictated
by
a
disappointed
spirit
and
a
thirst
for
revenge
but
we
must
not
condemn
rogero
too
harshly
for
he
was
the
victim
of
magic
power
they
seated
themselves
at
table
and
immediately
harmonious
lyres
and
harps
waked
the
air
with
the
most
ravishing
notes
the
charms
of
poetry
were
added
in
entertaining
recitals
the
magnificence
of
the
feast
would
have
done
credit
to
a
royal
board
the
traitress
forgot
nothing
which
might
charm
the
paladin
and
attach
him
to
the
spot
meaning
when
she
should
grow
tired
of
him
to
metamorphose
him
as
she
had
done
others
in
the
same
manner
passed
each
succeeding
day
games
of
pleasant
exercise
the
chase
the
dance
or
rural
sports
made
the
hours
pass
quickly
while
they
gave
zest
to
the
refreshment
of
the
bath
or
sleep
thus
rogero
led
a
life
of
ease
and
luxury
while
charlemagne
and
agramant
were
struggling
for
empire
but
i
can
not
linger
with
him
while
the
amiable
and
courageous
bradamante
is
night
and
day
directing
her
uncertain
steps
to
every
spot
where
the
slightest
chance
invites
her
in
the
hope
of
recovering
rogero
i
will
therefore
say
that
having
sought
him
in
vain
in
fields
and
in
cities
she
knew
not
whither
next
to
direct
her
steps
she
did
not
apprehend
the
death
of
rogero
the
fall
of
such
a
hero
would
have
reechoed
from
the
hydaspes
to
the
farthest
river
of
the
west
but
not
knowing
whether
he
was
on
the
earth
or
in
the
air
she
concluded
as
a
last
resource
to
return
to
the
cavern
which
contained
the
tomb
of
merlin
to
ask
of
him
some
sure
direction
to
the
object
of
her
search
while
this
thought
occupied
her
mind
melissa
the
sage
enchantress
suddenly
appeared
before
her
this
virtuous
and
beneficent
magician
had
discovered
by
her
spells
that
rogero
was
passing
his
time
in
pleasure
and
idleness
forgetful
of
his
honor
and
his
sovereign
not
able
to
endure
the
thought
that
one
who
was
born
to
be
a
hero
should
waste
his
years
in
base
repose
and
leave
a
sullied
reputation
in
the
memory
of
survivors
she
saw
that
vigorous
measures
must
be
employed
to
draw
him
forth
into
the
paths
of
virtue
melissa
was
not
blinded
by
her
affection
for
the
amiable
paladin
like
atlantes
who
intent
only
on
preserving
rogero
life
cared
nothing
for
his
fame
it
was
that
old
enchanter
whose
arts
had
guided
the
hippogriff
to
the
isle
of
the
too
charming
alcina
where
he
hoped
his
favorite
would
learn
to
forget
honor
and
lose
the
love
of
glory
at
the
sight
of
melissa
joy
lighted
up
the
countenance
of
bradamante
and
hope
animated
her
breast
melissa
concealed
nothing
from
her
but
told
her
how
rogero
was
in
the
toils
of
alcina
bradamante
was
plunged
in
grief
and
terror
but
the
kind
enchantress
calmed
her
dispelled
her
fears
and
promised
that
before
many
days
she
would
lead
back
the
paladin
to
her
feet
my
daughter
she
said
give
me
the
ring
which
you
wear
and
which
possesses
the
power
to
overcome
enchantments
by
means
of
it
i
doubt
not
but
that
i
may
enter
the
stronghold
where
the
false
alcina
holds
rogero
in
durance
and
may
succeed
in
vanquishing
her
and
liberating
him
bradamante
unhesitatingly
delivered
her
the
ring
recommending
rogero
to
her
best
efforts
melissa
then
summoned
by
her
art
a
huge
palfrey
black
as
jet
excepting
one
foot
which
was
bay
mounted
upon
this
animal
she
rode
with
such
speed
that
by
the
next
morning
she
had
reached
the
abode
of
alcina
she
here
transformed
herself
into
the
perfect
resemblance
of
the
old
magician
atlantes
adding
a
to
her
height
and
enlarging
her
whole
figure
her
chin
she
covered
with
a
long
beard
and
seamed
her
whole
visage
well
with
wrinkles
she
assumed
also
his
voice
and
manner
and
watched
her
chance
to
find
rogero
alone
at
last
she
found
him
dressed
in
a
rich
tunic
of
silk
and
gold
a
collar
of
precious
stones
about
his
neck
and
his
arms
once
so
rough
with
exercise
decorated
with
bracelets
his
air
and
his
every
motion
indicated
effeminacy
and
he
seemed
to
retain
nothing
of
rogero
but
the
name
such
power
had
the
enchantress
obtained
over
him
melissa
under
the
form
of
his
old
instructor
presented
herself
before
him
wearing
a
stern
and
serious
visage
is
this
then
she
said
the
fruit
of
all
my
labors
is
it
for
this
that
i
fed
you
on
the
marrow
of
bears
and
lions
that
i
taught
you
to
subdue
dragons
and
like
hercules
strangle
serpents
in
your
youthful
grasp
only
to
make
you
by
all
my
cares
a
feeble
adonis
my
nightly
watchings
of
the
stars
of
the
yet
warm
fibres
of
animals
the
lots
i
have
cast
the
points
of
nativity
that
i
have
calculated
have
they
all
falsely
indicated
that
you
were
born
for
greatness
who
could
have
believed
that
you
would
become
the
slave
of
a
base
enchantress
o
rogero
learn
to
know
this
alcina
learn
to
understand
her
arts
and
to
countervail
them
take
this
ring
place
it
on
your
finger
return
to
her
presence
and
see
for
yourself
what
are
her
real
charms
at
these
words
rogero
confused
abashed
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
and
knew
not
what
to
answer
melissa
seized
the
moment
slipped
the
ring
on
his
finger
and
the
paladin
was
himself
again
what
a
thunderclap
to
him
overcome
by
shame
he
dared
not
to
encounter
the
looks
of
his
instructor
when
at
last
he
raised
his
eyes
he
beheld
not
that
venerable
form
but
the
priestess
melissa
who
in
virtue
of
the
ring
now
appeared
in
her
true
person
she
told
him
of
the
motives
which
had
led
her
to
come
to
his
rescue
of
the
griefs
and
regrets
of
bradamante
and
of
her
unwearied
search
for
him
that
charming
amazon
she
said
sends
you
this
ring
which
is
a
sovereign
antidote
to
all
enchantments
she
would
have
sent
you
her
heart
in
my
hands
if
it
would
have
had
greater
power
to
serve
you
it
was
needless
for
melissa
to
say
more
rogero
love
for
alcina
being
but
the
work
of
enchantment
vanished
as
soon
as
the
enchantment
was
withdrawn
and
he
now
hated
her
with
an
equal
intensity
seeing
no
longer
anything
in
her
but
her
vices
and
feeling
only
resentment
for
the
shame
that
she
had
put
upon
him
his
surprise
when
he
again
beheld
alcina
was
no
less
than
his
indignation
fortified
by
his
ring
from
her
enchantments
he
saw
her
as
she
was
a
monster
of
ugliness
all
her
charms
were
artificial
and
truly
viewed
were
rather
deformities
she
was
in
fact
older
than
hecuba
or
the
sibyl
of
cumae
but
an
art
which
it
is
to
be
regretted
our
times
have
lost
enabled
her
to
appear
charming
and
to
clothe
herself
in
all
the
attractions
of
youth
rogero
now
saw
all
this
but
governed
by
the
counsels
of
melissa
he
concealed
his
surprise
assumed
under
some
pretext
his
armor
long
neglected
and
bound
to
his
side
belisarda
his
trusty
sword
taking
also
the
buckler
of
atlantes
covered
with
its
veil
he
then
selected
a
horse
from
the
stables
of
alcina
without
exciting
her
suspicions
but
he
left
the
hippogriff
by
the
advice
of
melissa
who
promised
to
take
him
in
charge
and
train
him
to
a
more
manageable
state
the
horse
he
took
was
rabican
which
belonged
to
astolpho
he
restored
the
ring
to
melissa
rogero
had
not
ridden
far
when
he
met
one
of
the
huntsmen
of
alcina
bearing
a
falcon
on
his
wrist
and
followed
by
a
dog
the
huntsman
was
mounted
on
a
powerful
horse
and
came
boldly
up
to
the
paladin
demanding
in
a
somewhat
imperious
manner
whither
he
was
going
so
rapidly
rogero
disdained
to
stop
or
to
reply
whereupon
the
huntsman
not
doubting
that
he
was
about
making
his
escape
said
what
if
i
with
my
falcon
stop
your
ride
so
saying
he
threw
off
the
bird
which
even
rabican
could
not
equal
in
speed
the
huntsman
then
leapt
from
his
horse
and
the
animal
darted
after
rogero
with
the
swiftness
of
an
arrow
the
huntsman
also
ran
as
if
the
wind
or
fire
bore
him
and
the
dog
was
equal
to
rabican
in
swiftness
rogero
finding
flight
impossible
stopped
and
faced
his
pursuers
but
his
sword
was
useless
against
such
foes
the
insolent
huntsman
assailed
him
with
words
and
struck
him
with
his
whip
the
only
weapon
he
had
the
dog
bit
his
feet
and
the
horse
drove
at
him
with
his
hoofs
at
the
same
time
the
falcon
flew
over
his
head
and
over
rabican
and
attacked
them
with
claws
and
wings
so
that
the
horse
in
his
fright
began
to
be
unmanageable
at
that
moment
the
sound
of
trumpets
and
cymbals
was
heard
in
the
valley
and
it
was
evident
that
alcina
had
ordered
out
all
her
array
to
go
in
pursuit
rogero
felt
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
and
luckily
remembered
the
shield
of
atlantes
which
he
bore
suspended
from
his
neck
he
unveiled
it
and
the
charm
worked
wonderfully
the
huntsman
the
dog
the
horse
fell
flat
the
trembling
wings
of
the
falcon
could
no
longer
sustain
her
and
she
fell
senseless
to
the
ground
rogero
rid
of
their
annoyances
left
them
in
their
trance
and
rode
away
meanwhile
alcina
with
all
the
force
she
could
muster
sallied
forth
from
her
palace
in
pursuit
melissa
left
behind
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
ransack
all
the
rooms
protected
by
the
ring
she
undid
one
by
one
all
the
talismans
and
spells
which
she
found
broke
the
seals
burned
the
images
and
untied
the
hagknots
thence
hurrying
through
the
fields
she
disenchanted
the
victims
changed
into
trees
fountains
stones
or
brutes
all
of
whom
recovered
their
liberty
and
vowed
eternal
gratitude
to
their
deliverer
they
made
their
escape
with
all
possible
despatch
to
the
realms
of
the
good
logestilla
whence
they
departed
to
their
several
homes
astolpho
was
the
first
whom
melissa
liberated
for
rogero
had
particularly
recommended
him
to
her
care
she
aided
him
to
recover
his
arms
and
particularly
that
precious
lance
which
once
was
argalia
the
enchantress
mounted
with
him
upon
the
winged
horse
and
in
a
short
time
arrived
through
the
air
at
the
castle
of
logestilla
where
rogero
joined
them
soon
after
in
this
abode
the
friends
passed
a
short
period
of
delightful
and
improving
intercourse
with
the
sage
logestilla
and
her
virtuous
court
and
then
each
departed
rogero
with
the
hippogriff
ring
and
buckler
astolpho
with
his
golden
lance
and
mounted
on
rabican
the
fleetest
of
steeds
to
rogero
logestilla
gave
a
bit
and
bridle
suited
to
govern
the
hippogriff
and
to
astolpho
a
horn
of
marvellous
powers
to
be
sounded
only
when
all
other
weapons
were
unavailing
the
orc
we
left
the
charming
angelica
at
the
moment
when
in
her
flight
from
her
contending
lovers
sacripant
and
rinaldo
she
met
an
aged
hermit
we
have
seen
that
her
request
to
the
hermit
was
to
furnish
her
the
means
of
gaining
the
eager
to
avoid
rinaldo
whom
she
hated
by
leaving
france
and
europe
itself
the
pretended
hermit
who
was
no
other
than
a
vile
magician
knowing
well
that
it
would
not
be
agreeable
to
his
false
gods
to
aid
angelica
in
this
undertaking
feigned
to
comply
with
her
desire
he
supplied
her
a
horse
into
which
he
had
by
his
arts
caused
a
subtle
devil
to
enter
and
having
mounted
angelica
on
the
animal
directed
her
what
course
to
take
to
reach
the
sea
angelica
rode
on
her
way
without
suspicion
but
when
arrived
at
the
shore
the
demon
urged
the
animal
headlong
into
the
water
angelica
in
vain
attempted
to
turn
him
back
to
the
land
he
continued
his
course
till
as
night
approached
he
landed
with
his
burden
on
a
sandy
headland
angelica
finding
herself
alone
abandoned
in
this
frightful
solitude
remained
without
movement
as
if
stupefied
with
hands
joined
and
eyes
turned
towards
heaven
till
at
last
pouring
forth
a
torrent
of
tears
she
exclaimed
cruel
fortune
have
you
not
yet
exhausted
your
rage
against
me
to
what
new
miseries
do
you
doom
me
alas
then
finish
your
work
deliver
me
a
prey
to
some
ferocious
beast
or
by
whatever
fate
you
choose
bring
me
to
an
end
i
will
be
thankful
to
you
for
terminating
my
life
and
my
misery
at
last
exhausted
by
her
sorrows
she
fell
asleep
and
sunk
prostrate
on
the
sand
before
recounting
what
next
befell
we
must
declare
what
place
it
was
upon
which
the
unhappy
lady
was
now
thrown
in
the
sea
that
washes
the
coast
of
ireland
there
is
an
island
called
ebuda
whose
inhabitants
once
numerous
had
been
wasted
by
the
anger
of
proteus
till
there
were
now
but
few
left
this
deity
was
incensed
by
some
neglect
of
the
usual
honors
which
he
had
in
old
times
received
from
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
and
to
execute
his
vengeance
had
sent
a
horrid
called
an
orc
to
devour
them
such
were
the
terrors
of
his
ravages
that
the
whole
people
of
the
isle
had
shut
themselves
up
in
the
principal
town
and
relied
on
their
walls
alone
to
protect
them
in
this
distress
they
applied
to
the
oracle
for
advice
and
were
directed
to
appease
the
wrath
of
the
by
offering
to
him
the
fairest
virgin
that
the
country
could
produce
now
it
so
happened
that
the
very
day
when
this
dreadful
oracle
was
announced
and
when
the
fatal
mandate
had
gone
forth
to
seek
among
the
fairest
maidens
of
the
land
one
to
be
offered
to
the
monster
some
sailors
landing
on
the
beach
where
angelica
was
beheld
that
beauty
as
she
lay
asleep
o
blind
chance
whose
power
in
human
affairs
is
but
too
great
canst
thou
then
abandon
to
the
teeth
of
a
horrible
monster
those
charms
which
different
sovereigns
took
arms
against
one
another
to
possess
alas
the
lovely
angelica
is
destined
to
be
the
victim
of
those
cruel
islanders
still
asleep
she
was
bound
by
the
ebudians
and
it
was
not
until
she
was
carried
on
board
the
vessel
that
she
came
to
a
knowledge
of
her
situation
the
wind
filled
the
sails
and
wafted
the
ship
swiftly
to
the
port
where
all
that
beheld
her
agreed
that
she
was
unquestionably
the
victim
selected
by
proteus
himself
to
be
his
prey
who
can
tell
the
screams
the
mortal
anguish
of
this
unhappy
maiden
the
reproaches
she
addressed
even
to
the
heavens
themselves
when
the
dreadful
information
of
her
cruel
fate
was
made
known
to
her
i
can
not
let
me
rather
turn
to
a
happier
part
of
my
story
rogero
left
the
palace
of
logestilla
careering
on
his
flying
courser
far
above
the
tops
of
the
mountains
and
borne
westward
by
the
hippogriff
which
he
guided
with
ease
by
means
of
the
bridle
that
melissa
had
given
him
anxious
as
he
was
to
recover
bradamante
he
could
not
fail
to
be
delighted
at
the
view
his
rapid
flight
presented
of
so
many
vast
regions
and
populous
countries
as
he
passed
over
in
his
career
at
last
he
approached
the
shores
of
england
and
perceived
an
immense
army
in
all
the
splendor
of
military
pomp
as
if
about
to
go
forth
flushed
with
hopes
of
victory
he
caused
the
hippogriff
to
alight
not
far
from
the
scene
and
found
himself
immediately
surrounded
by
admiring
spectators
knights
and
soldiers
who
could
not
enough
indulge
their
curiosity
and
wonder
rogero
learned
in
reply
to
his
questions
that
the
fine
array
of
troops
before
him
was
the
army
destined
to
go
to
the
aid
of
the
french
emperor
in
compliance
with
the
request
presented
by
the
illustrious
rinaldo
as
ambassador
of
king
charles
his
uncle
by
this
time
the
curiosity
of
the
english
chevaliers
was
partly
gratified
in
beholding
the
hippogriff
at
rest
and
rogero
to
renew
their
surprise
and
delight
remounted
the
animal
and
slapping
spurs
to
his
sides
made
him
launch
into
the
air
with
the
rapidity
of
a
meteor
and
directed
his
flight
still
westwardly
till
he
came
within
sight
of
the
coasts
of
ireland
here
he
descried
what
seemed
to
be
a
fair
damsel
alone
fast
chained
to
a
rock
which
projected
into
the
sea
what
was
his
astonishment
when
drawing
nigh
he
beheld
the
beautiful
princess
angelica
that
day
she
had
been
led
forth
and
bound
to
the
rock
there
to
wait
till
the
should
come
to
devour
her
rogero
exclaimed
as
he
came
near
what
cruel
hands
what
barbarous
soul
what
fatal
chance
can
have
loaded
thee
with
those
chains
angelica
replied
by
a
torrent
of
tears
at
first
her
only
response
then
in
a
trembling
voice
she
disclosed
to
him
the
horrible
destiny
for
which
she
was
there
exposed
while
she
spoke
a
terrible
roaring
was
heard
far
off
on
the
sea
the
huge
monster
soon
came
in
sight
part
of
his
body
appearing
above
the
waves
and
part
concealed
angelica
half
dead
with
fear
abandoned
herself
to
despair
rogero
lance
in
rest
spurred
his
hippogriff
toward
the
orc
and
gave
him
a
thrust
the
horrible
monster
was
like
nothing
that
nature
produces
it
was
but
one
mass
of
tossing
and
twisting
body
with
nothing
of
the
animal
but
head
eyes
and
mouth
the
last
furnished
with
tusks
like
those
of
the
wild
boar
rogero
lance
had
struck
him
between
the
eyes
but
rock
and
iron
are
not
more
impenetrable
than
were
his
scales
the
knight
seeing
the
fruitlessness
of
the
first
blow
prepared
to
give
a
second
the
animal
beholding
upon
the
water
the
shadow
of
the
great
wings
of
the
hippogriff
abandoned
his
prey
and
turned
to
seize
what
seemed
nearer
rogero
took
the
opportunity
and
dealt
him
furious
blows
on
various
parts
of
his
body
taking
care
to
keep
clear
of
his
murderous
teeth
but
the
scales
resisted
every
attack
the
orc
beat
the
water
with
his
tail
till
he
raised
a
foam
which
enveloped
rogero
and
his
steed
so
that
the
knight
hardly
knew
whether
he
was
in
the
water
or
the
air
he
began
to
fear
that
the
wings
of
the
hippogriff
would
be
so
drenched
with
water
that
they
would
cease
to
sustain
him
at
that
moment
rogero
bethought
him
of
the
magic
shield
which
hung
at
his
but
the
fear
that
angelica
would
also
be
blinded
by
its
glare
discouraged
him
from
employing
it
then
he
remembered
the
ring
which
melissa
had
given
him
the
power
of
which
he
had
so
lately
proved
he
hastened
to
angelica
and
placed
it
on
her
finger
then
uncovering
the
buckler
he
turned
its
bright
disk
full
in
the
face
of
the
detestable
orc
the
effect
was
instantaneous
the
monster
deprived
of
sense
and
motion
rolled
over
on
the
sea
and
lay
floating
on
his
back
rogero
would
fain
have
tried
the
effect
of
his
lance
on
the
now
exposed
parts
but
angelica
implored
him
to
lose
no
time
in
delivering
her
from
her
chains
before
the
monster
should
revive
rogero
moved
with
her
entreaties
hastened
to
do
so
and
having
unbound
her
made
her
mount
behind
him
on
the
hippogriff
the
animal
spurning
the
earth
shot
up
into
the
air
and
rapidly
sped
his
way
through
it
rogero
to
give
time
to
the
princess
to
rest
after
her
cruel
agitations
soon
sought
the
earth
again
alighting
on
the
shore
of
brittany
near
the
shore
a
thick
wood
presented
itself
which
resounded
with
the
songs
of
birds
in
the
midst
a
fountain
of
transparent
water
bathed
the
turf
of
a
little
meadow
a
gentle
hill
rose
near
by
rogero
making
the
hippogriff
alight
in
the
meadow
dismounted
and
took
angelica
from
the
horse
when
the
first
tumults
of
emotion
had
subsided
angelica
casting
her
eyes
downward
beheld
the
precious
ring
upon
her
finger
whose
virtues
she
was
well
acquainted
with
for
it
was
the
very
ring
which
the
saracen
brunello
had
robbed
her
of
she
drew
it
from
her
finger
and
placed
it
in
her
mouth
and
quicker
than
we
can
tell
it
disappeared
from
the
sight
of
the
paladin
rogero
looked
around
him
on
all
sides
like
one
frantic
but
soon
remembered
the
ring
which
he
had
so
lately
placed
on
her
finger
struck
with
the
ingratitude
which
could
thus
recompense
his
services
he
exclaimed
thankless
beauty
is
this
then
the
reward
you
make
me
do
you
prefer
to
rob
me
of
my
ring
rather
than
receive
it
as
a
gift
willingly
would
i
have
given
it
to
you
had
you
but
asked
it
thus
he
said
searching
on
all
sides
with
arms
extended
like
a
blind
man
hoping
to
recover
by
the
touch
what
was
lost
to
sight
but
he
sought
in
vain
the
cruel
beauty
was
already
far
away
though
sensible
of
her
obligations
to
her
deliverer
her
first
necessity
was
for
clothing
food
and
repose
she
soon
reached
a
shepherd
hut
where
entering
unseen
she
found
what
sufficed
for
her
present
relief
an
old
herdsman
inhabited
the
hut
whose
charges
consisted
of
a
drove
of
mares
when
recruited
by
repose
angelica
selected
one
of
the
mares
from
the
flock
and
mounting
the
animal
felt
the
desire
revive
in
her
mind
of
returning
to
her
home
in
the
east
and
for
that
purpose
would
gladly
have
accepted
the
protection
of
orlando
or
of
sacripant
across
those
wide
regions
which
divided
her
from
her
own
country
in
hopes
of
meeting
with
one
or
the
other
of
them
she
pursued
her
way
meanwhile
rogero
despairing
of
seeing
angelica
again
returned
to
the
tree
where
he
had
left
his
winged
horse
but
had
the
mortification
to
find
that
the
animal
had
broken
his
bridle
and
escaped
this
loss
added
to
his
previous
disappointment
overwhelmed
him
with
vexation
sadly
he
gathered
up
his
arms
threw
his
buckler
over
his
shoulders
and
taking
the
first
path
that
offered
soon
found
himself
within
the
verge
of
a
dense
and
widespread
forest
he
had
proceeded
for
some
distance
when
he
heard
a
noise
on
his
right
and
listening
attentively
distinguished
the
clash
of
arms
he
made
his
way
toward
the
place
whence
the
sound
proceeded
and
found
two
warriors
engaged
in
mortal
combat
one
of
them
was
a
knight
of
a
noble
and
manly
bearing
the
other
a
fierce
giant
the
knight
appeared
to
exert
consummate
address
in
defending
herself
against
the
massive
club
of
the
giant
evading
his
strokes
or
parrying
them
with
sword
or
shield
rogero
stood
spectator
of
the
combat
for
he
did
not
allow
himself
to
interfere
in
it
though
a
secret
sentiment
inclined
him
strongly
to
take
part
with
the
knight
at
length
he
saw
with
grief
the
massive
club
fall
directly
on
the
head
of
the
knight
who
yielded
to
the
blow
and
fell
prostrate
the
giant
sprang
forward
to
despatch
him
and
for
that
purpose
unlaced
his
helmet
when
rogero
with
dismay
recognized
the
face
of
bradamante
he
cried
aloud
hold
miscreant
and
sprang
forward
with
drawn
sword
whereupon
the
giant
as
if
he
cared
not
to
enter
upon
another
combat
lifted
bradamante
on
his
shoulders
and
ran
with
her
into
the
forest
rogero
plunged
after
him
but
the
long
legs
of
the
giant
carried
him
forward
so
fast
that
the
paladin
could
hardly
keep
him
in
sight
at
length
they
issued
from
the
wood
and
rogero
perceived
before
him
a
rich
palace
built
of
marble
and
adorned
with
sculptures
executed
by
a
master
hand
into
this
edifice
through
a
golden
door
the
giant
passed
and
rogero
followed
but
on
looking
round
saw
nowhere
either
the
giant
or
bradamante
he
ran
from
room
to
room
calling
aloud
on
his
cowardly
foe
to
turn
and
meet
him
but
got
no
response
nor
caught
another
glimpse
of
the
giant
or
his
prey
in
his
vain
pursuit
he
met
without
knowing
them
ferrau
florismart
king
gradasso
orlando
and
many
others
all
of
whom
had
been
entrapped
like
himself
into
this
enchanted
castle
it
was
a
new
stratagem
of
the
magician
atlantes
to
draw
rogero
into
his
power
and
to
secure
also
those
who
might
by
any
chance
endanger
his
safety
what
rogero
had
taken
for
bradamante
was
a
mere
phantom
that
charming
lady
was
far
away
full
of
anxiety
for
her
rogero
whose
coming
she
had
long
expected
the
emperor
had
committed
to
her
charge
the
city
and
garrison
of
marseilles
and
she
held
the
post
against
the
infidels
with
valor
and
discretion
one
day
melissa
suddenly
presented
herself
before
her
anticipating
her
questions
she
said
fear
not
for
rogero
he
lives
and
is
as
ever
true
to
you
but
he
has
lost
his
liberty
the
fell
enchanter
has
again
succeeded
in
making
him
a
prisoner
if
you
would
deliver
him
mount
your
horse
and
follow
me
she
told
her
in
what
manner
atlantes
had
deceived
rogero
in
deluding
his
eyes
with
the
phantom
of
herself
in
peril
such
she
continued
will
be
his
arts
in
your
own
case
if
you
penetrate
the
forest
and
approach
that
castle
you
will
think
you
behold
rogero
when
in
fact
you
see
only
the
enchanter
himself
be
not
deceived
plunge
your
sword
into
his
body
and
trust
me
when
i
tell
you
that
in
slaying
him
you
will
restore
not
only
rogero
but
with
him
many
of
the
bravest
knights
of
france
whom
the
wizard
arts
have
withdrawn
from
the
camp
of
their
sovereign
bradamante
promptly
armed
herself
and
mounted
her
horse
melissa
led
her
by
forced
journeys
by
field
and
forest
beguiling
the
way
with
conversation
on
the
theme
which
interested
her
hearer
most
when
at
last
they
reached
the
forest
she
repeated
once
more
her
instructions
and
then
took
her
leave
for
fear
the
enchanter
might
espy
her
and
be
put
on
his
guard
bradamante
rode
on
about
two
miles
when
suddenly
she
beheld
rogero
as
it
appeared
to
her
hard
pressed
by
two
fierce
giants
while
she
hesitated
she
heard
his
voice
calling
on
her
for
help
at
once
the
cautions
of
melissa
lost
their
weight
a
sudden
doubt
of
the
faith
and
truth
of
her
kind
monitress
flashed
across
her
mind
shall
i
not
believe
my
own
eyes
and
ears
she
said
and
rushed
forward
to
his
defence
rogero
fled
pursued
by
the
giants
and
bradamante
followed
passing
with
them
through
the
castle
gate
when
there
bradamante
was
undeceived
for
neither
giant
nor
knight
was
to
be
seen
she
found
herself
a
prisoner
but
had
not
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
she
shared
the
imprisonment
of
her
beloved
she
saw
various
forms
of
men
and
women
but
could
recognize
none
of
them
and
their
lot
was
the
same
with
respect
to
her
each
viewed
the
others
under
some
illusion
of
the
fancy
wearing
the
semblance
of
giants
dwarfs
or
even
animals
so
that
there
was
no
companionship
or
communication
between
them
astolpho
adventures
continued
and
isabella
begun
when
astolpho
escaped
from
the
cruel
alcina
after
a
short
abode
in
the
realm
of
the
virtuous
logestilla
he
desired
to
return
to
his
native
country
logestilla
lent
him
the
best
vessel
of
her
fleet
to
convey
him
to
the
mainland
she
gave
him
at
parting
a
wonderful
book
which
taught
the
secret
of
overcoming
all
manners
of
enchantments
and
begged
him
to
carry
it
always
with
him
out
of
regard
for
her
she
also
gave
him
another
gift
which
surpassed
everything
of
the
kind
that
mortal
workmanship
can
frame
yet
it
was
nothing
in
appearance
but
a
simple
horn
astolpho
protected
by
these
gifts
thanked
the
good
fairy
took
leave
of
her
and
set
out
on
his
return
to
france
his
voyage
was
prosperous
and
on
reaching
the
desired
port
he
took
leave
of
the
faithful
mariners
and
continued
his
journey
by
land
as
he
proceeded
over
mountains
and
through
valleys
he
often
met
with
bands
of
robbers
wild
beasts
and
venomous
serpents
but
he
had
only
to
sound
his
horn
to
put
them
all
to
flight
having
landed
in
france
and
traversed
many
provinces
on
his
way
to
the
army
he
one
day
in
crossing
a
forest
arrived
beside
a
fountain
and
alighted
to
drink
while
he
stooped
at
the
fountain
a
young
rustic
sprang
from
the
copse
mounted
rabican
and
rode
away
it
was
a
new
trick
of
the
enchanter
atlantes
astolpho
hearing
the
noise
turned
his
head
just
in
time
to
see
his
loss
and
starting
up
pursued
the
thief
who
on
his
part
did
not
press
the
horse
to
his
full
speed
but
just
kept
in
sight
of
his
pursuer
till
they
both
issued
from
the
forest
and
then
rabican
and
his
rider
took
shelter
in
a
castle
which
stood
near
astolpho
followed
and
penetrated
without
difficulty
within
the
of
the
castle
where
he
looked
around
for
the
rider
and
his
horse
but
could
see
no
trace
of
either
nor
any
person
of
whom
he
could
make
inquiry
suspecting
that
enchantment
was
employed
to
embarrass
him
he
bethought
him
of
his
book
and
on
consulting
it
discovered
that
his
suspicions
were
well
founded
he
also
learned
what
course
to
pursue
he
was
directed
to
raise
the
stone
which
served
as
a
threshold
under
which
a
spirit
lay
pent
who
would
willingly
escape
and
leave
the
castle
free
of
access
astolpho
applied
his
strength
to
lift
aside
the
stone
thereupon
the
magician
put
his
arts
in
force
the
castle
was
full
of
prisoners
and
the
magician
caused
that
to
all
of
them
astolpho
should
appear
in
some
false
guise
to
some
a
wild
beast
to
others
a
giant
to
others
a
bird
of
prey
thus
all
assailed
him
and
would
quickly
have
made
an
end
of
him
if
he
had
not
bethought
him
of
his
horn
no
sooner
had
he
blown
a
blast
than
at
the
horrid
larum
fled
the
cavaliers
and
the
necromancer
with
them
like
a
flock
of
pigeons
at
the
sound
of
the
fowler
gun
astolpho
then
renewed
his
efforts
on
the
stone
and
turned
it
over
the
under
face
was
all
inscribed
with
magical
characters
which
the
knight
defaced
as
directed
by
his
book
and
no
sooner
had
he
done
so
than
the
castle
with
its
walls
and
turrets
vanished
into
smoke
the
knights
and
ladies
set
at
liberty
were
besides
rogero
and
bradamante
orlando
gradasso
florismart
and
many
more
at
the
sound
of
the
horn
they
fled
one
and
all
men
and
steeds
except
rabican
which
astolpho
secured
in
spite
of
his
terror
as
soon
as
the
sound
had
ceased
rogero
recognized
bradamante
whom
he
had
daily
met
during
their
imprisonment
but
had
been
prevented
from
knowing
by
the
enchanter
arts
no
words
can
tell
the
delight
with
which
they
recognized
each
other
and
recounted
mutually
all
that
had
happened
to
each
since
they
were
parted
rogero
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
press
his
suit
and
found
bradamante
as
propitious
as
he
could
wish
were
it
not
for
a
single
obstacle
the
difference
of
their
faiths
if
he
would
obtain
her
in
marriage
she
said
he
must
in
due
form
demand
her
of
her
father
duke
aymon
and
must
abandon
his
false
prophet
and
become
a
christian
the
latter
step
was
one
which
rogero
had
for
some
time
intended
taking
for
reasons
of
his
own
he
therefore
gladly
accepted
the
terms
and
proposed
that
they
should
at
once
repair
to
the
abbey
of
vallombrosa
whose
towers
were
visible
at
no
great
distance
thither
they
turned
their
horses
heads
and
we
will
leave
them
to
find
their
way
without
our
company
i
know
not
if
my
readers
recollect
that
at
the
moment
when
rogero
had
just
delivered
angelica
from
the
voracious
orc
that
scornful
beauty
placed
her
ring
in
her
mouth
and
vanished
out
of
sight
at
the
same
time
the
hippogriff
shook
off
his
bridle
soared
away
and
flew
to
rejoin
his
former
master
very
naturally
returning
to
his
accustomed
stable
here
astolpho
found
him
to
his
very
great
delight
he
knew
the
animal
powers
having
seen
rogero
ride
him
and
he
longed
to
fly
abroad
over
all
the
earth
and
see
various
nations
and
peoples
from
his
airy
course
he
had
heard
logestilla
directions
how
to
guide
the
animal
and
saw
her
fit
a
bridle
to
his
head
he
therefore
was
able
out
of
all
the
bridles
he
found
in
the
stable
to
select
one
suitable
and
placing
rabican
saddle
on
the
hippogriff
back
nothing
seemed
to
prevent
his
immediate
departure
yet
before
he
went
he
bethought
him
of
placing
rabican
in
hands
where
he
would
be
safe
and
whence
he
might
recover
him
in
time
of
need
while
he
stood
deliberating
where
he
should
find
a
messenger
he
saw
bradamante
approach
that
fair
warrior
had
been
parted
from
rogero
on
their
way
to
the
abbey
of
vallombrosa
by
an
inopportune
adventure
which
had
called
the
knight
away
she
was
now
returning
to
montalban
having
arranged
with
rogero
to
join
her
there
to
bradamante
therefore
his
fair
cousin
astolpho
committed
rabican
and
also
the
lance
of
gold
which
would
only
be
an
incumbrance
in
his
aerial
excursion
bradamante
took
charge
of
both
and
astolpho
bidding
her
farewell
soared
in
air
among
those
delivered
by
astolpho
from
the
magician
castle
was
orlando
following
the
guide
of
chance
the
paladin
found
himself
at
the
close
of
day
in
a
forest
and
stopped
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
surprised
to
discern
a
light
which
came
from
a
cleft
in
the
rock
he
approached
guided
by
the
ray
and
discovered
a
narrow
passage
in
the
which
led
into
a
deep
grotto
orlando
fastened
his
horse
and
then
putting
aside
the
bushes
that
resisted
his
passage
stepped
down
from
rock
to
rock
till
he
reached
a
sort
of
cavern
entering
it
he
perceived
a
lady
young
and
handsome
as
well
as
he
could
discover
through
the
signs
of
distress
which
agitated
her
countenance
her
only
companion
was
an
old
woman
who
seemed
to
be
regarded
by
her
young
partner
with
terror
and
indignation
the
courteous
paladin
saluted
the
women
respectfully
and
begged
to
know
by
whose
barbarity
they
had
been
subjected
to
such
imprisonment
the
younger
lady
replied
in
a
voice
often
broken
with
sobs
though
i
know
well
that
my
recital
will
subject
me
to
worse
treatment
by
the
barbarous
man
who
keeps
me
here
to
whom
this
woman
will
not
fail
to
report
it
yet
i
will
not
hide
from
you
the
facts
ah
why
should
i
fear
his
rage
if
he
should
take
my
life
i
know
not
what
better
boon
than
death
i
can
ask
my
name
is
isabella
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
galicia
or
rather
i
should
say
misfortune
and
grief
are
my
parents
young
rich
modest
and
of
tranquil
temper
all
things
appeared
to
combine
to
render
my
lot
happy
alas
i
see
myself
poor
humbled
miserable
and
destined
perhaps
to
yet
further
afflictions
it
is
a
year
since
my
father
having
given
notice
that
he
would
open
the
lists
for
a
tournament
at
bayonne
a
great
number
of
chevaliers
from
all
quarters
came
together
at
our
court
among
these
zerbino
son
of
the
king
of
scotland
victorious
in
all
combats
eclipsed
by
his
beauty
and
his
valor
all
the
rest
before
departing
from
the
court
of
galicia
he
testified
the
wish
to
espouse
me
and
i
consented
that
he
should
demand
my
hand
of
the
king
my
father
but
i
was
a
mahometan
and
zerbino
a
christian
and
my
father
refused
his
consent
the
prince
called
home
by
his
father
to
take
command
of
the
forces
destined
to
the
assistance
of
the
french
emperor
prevailed
on
me
to
be
married
to
him
secretly
and
to
follow
him
to
scotland
he
caused
a
galley
to
be
prepared
to
receive
me
and
placed
in
command
of
it
the
chevalier
oderic
a
biscayan
famous
for
his
exploits
both
by
land
and
sea
on
the
day
appointed
oderic
brought
his
vessel
to
a
seaside
resort
of
my
father
where
i
embarked
some
of
my
domestics
accompanied
me
and
thus
i
departed
from
my
native
land
sailing
with
a
fair
wind
after
some
hours
we
were
assailed
by
a
violent
tempest
it
was
to
no
purpose
that
we
took
in
all
sail
we
were
driven
before
the
wind
directly
upon
the
rocky
shore
seeing
no
other
hopes
of
safety
oderic
placed
me
in
a
boat
followed
himself
with
a
few
of
his
men
and
made
for
land
we
reached
it
through
infinite
peril
and
i
no
sooner
felt
the
firm
land
beneath
my
feet
than
i
knelt
down
and
poured
out
heartfelt
thanks
to
the
providence
that
had
preserved
me
the
shore
where
we
landed
appeared
to
be
uninhabited
we
saw
no
dwelling
to
shelter
us
no
road
to
lead
us
to
a
more
hospitable
spot
a
high
mountain
rose
before
us
whose
base
stretched
into
the
sea
it
was
here
the
infamous
oderic
in
spite
of
my
tears
and
entreaties
sold
me
to
a
band
of
pirates
who
fancied
i
might
be
an
acceptable
present
to
their
prince
the
sultan
of
morocco
this
cavern
is
their
den
and
here
they
keep
me
under
the
guard
of
this
woman
until
it
shall
suit
their
convenience
to
carry
me
away
isabella
had
hardly
finished
her
recital
when
a
troop
of
armed
men
began
to
enter
the
cavern
seeing
the
prince
orlando
one
said
to
the
rest
what
bird
is
this
we
have
caught
without
even
setting
a
snare
for
him
then
addressing
orlando
it
was
truly
civil
in
you
friend
to
come
hither
with
that
handsome
coat
of
armor
and
vest
the
very
things
i
want
you
shall
pay
for
them
then
said
orlando
and
seizing
a
brand
from
the
fire
he
hurled
it
at
him
striking
his
head
and
stretching
him
lifeless
on
the
floor
there
was
a
massy
table
in
the
middle
of
the
cavern
used
for
the
pirates
repasts
orlando
lifted
it
and
hurled
it
at
the
robbers
as
they
stood
clustered
in
a
group
toward
the
entrance
half
the
gang
were
laid
prostrate
with
broken
heads
and
limbs
the
rest
got
away
as
nimbly
as
they
could
leaving
the
den
and
its
inmates
to
their
fate
orlando
taking
isabella
under
his
protection
pursued
his
way
for
some
days
without
meeting
with
any
adventure
one
day
they
saw
a
band
of
men
advancing
who
seemed
to
be
guarding
a
prisoner
bound
hand
and
foot
as
if
being
carried
to
execution
the
prisoner
was
a
youthful
cavalier
of
a
noble
and
ingenuous
appearance
the
band
bore
the
ensigns
of
count
anselm
head
of
the
treacherous
house
of
maganza
orlando
desired
isabella
to
wait
while
he
rode
forward
to
inquire
the
meaning
of
this
array
approaching
he
demanded
of
the
leader
who
his
prisoner
was
and
of
what
crime
he
had
been
guilty
the
man
replied
that
the
prisoner
was
a
murderer
by
whose
hand
pinabel
the
son
of
count
anselm
had
been
treacherously
slain
at
these
words
the
prisoner
exclaimed
i
am
no
murderer
nor
have
i
been
in
any
way
the
cause
of
the
young
man
death
orlando
knowing
the
cruel
and
ferocious
character
of
the
chiefs
of
the
house
of
maganza
needed
no
more
to
satisfy
him
that
the
youth
was
the
victim
of
injustice
he
commanded
the
leader
of
the
troop
to
release
his
victim
and
receiving
an
insolent
reply
dashed
him
to
the
earth
with
a
stroke
of
his
lance
then
by
a
few
vigorous
blows
dispersed
the
band
leaving
deadly
marks
on
those
who
were
slowest
to
quit
the
field
orlando
then
hastened
to
unbind
the
prisoner
and
to
assist
him
to
reclothe
himself
in
his
armor
which
the
false
magencian
had
dared
to
assume
he
then
led
him
to
isabella
who
now
approached
the
scene
of
action
how
can
we
picture
the
joy
the
astonishment
with
which
isabella
recognized
in
him
zerbino
her
husband
and
the
prince
discovered
her
whom
he
had
believed
overwhelmed
in
the
waves
they
embraced
one
another
and
wept
for
joy
orlando
sharing
in
their
happiness
congratulated
himself
in
having
been
the
instrument
of
it
the
princess
recounted
to
zerbino
what
the
illustrious
paladin
had
done
for
her
and
the
prince
threw
himself
at
orlando
feet
and
thanked
him
as
having
twice
preserved
his
life
while
these
exchanges
of
congratulation
and
thankfulness
were
going
on
a
sound
in
the
underwood
attracted
their
attention
and
caused
the
two
knights
to
brace
their
helmets
and
stand
on
their
guard
what
the
cause
of
the
interruption
was
we
shall
record
in
another
chapter
medoro
france
was
at
this
time
the
theatre
of
dreadful
events
the
saracens
and
the
christians
in
numerous
encounters
slew
one
another
on
one
occasion
rinaldo
led
an
attack
on
the
infidel
columns
broke
and
scattered
them
till
he
found
himself
opposite
to
a
knight
whose
armor
whether
by
accident
or
by
choice
it
matters
not
bore
the
blazon
of
orlando
it
was
dardinel
the
young
and
brave
prince
of
zumara
and
rinaldo
remarked
him
by
the
slaughter
he
spread
all
around
ah
said
he
to
himself
let
us
pluck
up
this
dangerous
plant
before
it
has
grown
to
its
full
height
as
rinaldo
advanced
the
crowd
opened
before
him
the
christians
to
let
his
sword
have
free
course
the
pagans
to
escape
its
sweep
dardinel
and
he
stood
face
to
face
rinaldo
exclaimed
fiercely
young
man
whoever
gave
you
that
noble
buckler
to
bear
made
you
a
dangerous
gift
i
should
like
to
see
how
you
are
able
to
defend
those
quarterings
red
and
white
if
you
can
not
defend
them
against
me
how
pray
will
you
do
so
when
orlando
challenges
them
dardinel
replied
thou
shalt
learn
that
i
can
defend
the
arms
i
bear
and
shed
new
glory
upon
them
no
one
shall
rend
them
from
me
but
with
life
saying
these
words
dardinel
rushed
upon
rinaldo
with
sword
uplifted
the
chill
of
mortal
terror
filled
the
souls
of
the
saracens
when
they
beheld
rinaldo
advance
to
attack
the
prince
like
a
lion
against
a
young
bull
the
first
blow
came
from
the
hand
of
dardinel
and
the
weapon
rebounded
from
helmet
without
effect
rinaldo
smiled
and
said
i
will
now
show
you
if
my
strokes
are
more
effectual
at
these
words
he
thrust
the
unfortunate
dardinel
in
the
middle
of
his
breast
the
blow
was
so
violent
that
the
cruel
weapon
pierced
the
body
and
came
out
a
behind
his
back
through
this
wound
the
life
of
dardinel
issued
with
his
blood
and
his
body
fell
helpless
to
the
ground
as
a
flower
which
the
passing
plough
has
uprooted
languishes
and
droops
its
head
so
dardinel
his
visage
covered
with
the
paleness
of
death
expires
and
the
hopes
of
an
illustrious
race
perish
with
him
like
waters
kept
back
by
a
dike
which
when
the
dike
is
broken
spread
abroad
through
all
the
country
so
the
moors
no
longer
kept
in
column
by
the
example
of
dardinel
fled
in
all
directions
rinaldo
despised
too
much
such
easy
victories
to
pursue
them
he
wished
for
no
combats
but
with
brave
men
at
the
same
time
the
other
paladins
made
terrible
slaughter
of
the
moors
charles
himself
oliver
guido
and
ogier
the
dane
carried
death
into
their
ranks
on
all
sides
the
infidels
seemed
doomed
to
perish
to
a
man
on
that
dreadful
day
but
the
wise
king
marsilius
at
last
put
some
slight
degree
of
method
into
the
general
rout
he
collected
the
remnant
of
the
troops
formed
them
into
a
battalion
and
retreated
in
tolerable
order
to
his
camp
that
camp
was
well
fortified
by
intrenchments
and
a
broad
ditch
thither
the
fugitives
hastened
and
by
degrees
all
that
remained
of
the
moorish
army
was
brought
together
there
the
emperor
might
perhaps
that
night
have
crushed
his
enemy
entirely
but
not
thinking
it
prudent
to
expose
his
troops
fatigued
as
they
were
to
an
attack
upon
a
camp
so
well
fortified
he
contented
himself
with
encompassing
the
enemy
with
his
troops
prepared
to
make
a
regular
siege
during
the
night
the
moors
had
time
to
see
the
extent
of
their
loss
their
tents
resounded
with
lamentations
this
warrior
had
to
mourn
a
brother
that
a
friend
many
suffered
with
grievous
wounds
all
trembled
at
the
fate
in
store
for
them
there
were
two
young
moors
both
of
humble
rank
who
gave
proof
at
that
time
of
attachment
and
fidelity
rare
in
the
history
of
man
cloridan
and
medoro
had
followed
their
prince
dardinel
to
the
wars
of
france
cloridan
a
bold
huntsman
combined
strength
with
activity
medoro
was
a
mere
youth
his
cheeks
yet
fair
and
blooming
of
all
the
saracens
no
one
united
so
much
grace
and
beauty
his
light
hair
was
set
off
by
his
black
and
sparkling
eyes
the
two
friends
were
together
on
guard
at
the
rampart
about
midnight
they
gazed
on
the
scene
in
deep
dejection
medoro
with
tears
in
his
eyes
spoke
of
the
good
prince
dardinel
and
could
not
endure
the
thought
that
his
body
should
be
cast
out
on
the
plain
deprived
of
funeral
honors
o
my
friend
said
he
must
then
the
body
of
our
prince
be
the
prey
of
wolves
and
ravens
alas
when
i
remember
how
he
loved
me
i
feel
that
if
i
should
sacrifice
my
life
to
do
him
honor
i
should
not
do
more
than
my
duty
i
wish
dear
friend
to
seek
out
his
body
on
the
battlefield
and
give
it
burial
and
i
hope
to
be
able
to
pass
through
king
charles
camp
without
discovery
as
they
are
probably
all
asleep
you
cloridan
will
be
able
to
say
for
me
if
i
should
die
in
the
adventure
that
gratitude
and
fidelity
to
my
prince
were
my
inducements
cloridan
was
both
surprised
and
touched
with
this
proof
of
the
young
man
devotion
he
loved
him
tenderly
and
tried
for
a
long
time
every
effort
to
dissuade
him
from
his
design
but
he
found
medoro
determined
to
accomplish
his
object
or
die
in
the
endeavor
cloridan
unable
to
change
his
purpose
said
i
will
go
with
you
medoro
and
help
you
in
this
generous
enterprise
i
value
not
life
compared
with
honor
and
if
i
did
do
you
suppose
dear
friend
that
i
could
live
without
you
i
would
rather
fall
by
the
arms
of
our
enemies
than
die
of
grief
for
the
loss
of
you
when
the
two
friends
were
relieved
from
their
guard
duty
they
went
without
any
followers
into
the
camp
of
the
christians
all
there
was
still
the
fires
were
dying
out
there
was
no
fear
of
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
saracens
and
the
soldiers
overcome
by
fatigue
or
wine
slept
secure
lying
upon
the
ground
in
the
midst
of
their
arms
and
equipage
cloridan
stopped
and
said
medoro
i
am
not
going
to
quit
this
camp
without
taking
vengeance
for
the
death
of
our
prince
keep
watch
be
on
your
guard
that
no
one
shall
surprise
us
i
mean
to
mark
a
road
with
my
sword
through
the
ranks
of
our
enemies
so
saying
he
entered
the
tent
where
alpheus
slept
who
a
year
before
had
joined
the
camp
of
charles
and
pretended
to
be
a
great
physician
and
astrologer
but
his
science
had
deceived
him
if
it
gave
him
hope
of
dying
peacefully
in
his
bed
at
a
good
old
age
his
lot
was
to
die
with
little
warning
cloridan
ran
his
sword
through
his
heart
a
greek
and
a
german
followed
who
had
been
playing
late
at
dice
fortunate
if
they
had
continued
their
game
a
little
longer
but
they
never
reckoned
a
throw
like
this
among
their
chances
cloridan
next
came
to
the
unlucky
grillon
whose
head
lay
softly
on
his
pillow
he
dreamed
probably
of
the
feast
from
which
he
had
but
just
retired
for
when
cloridan
cut
off
his
head
wine
flowed
forth
with
the
blood
the
two
young
moors
might
have
penetrated
even
to
the
tent
of
charlemagne
but
knowing
that
the
paladins
encamped
around
him
kept
watch
by
turns
and
judging
that
it
was
impossible
they
should
all
be
asleep
they
were
afraid
to
go
too
near
they
might
also
have
obtained
rich
booty
but
intent
only
on
their
object
they
crossed
the
camp
and
arrived
at
length
at
the
bloody
field
where
bucklers
lances
and
swords
lay
scattered
in
the
midst
of
corpses
of
poor
and
rich
common
soldier
and
prince
horses
and
pools
of
blood
this
terrible
scene
of
carnage
would
have
destroyed
all
hope
of
finding
what
they
were
in
search
of
until
dawn
of
day
were
it
not
that
the
moon
lent
the
aid
of
her
uncertain
rays
medoro
raised
his
eyes
to
the
planet
and
exclaimed
o
holy
goddess
whom
our
fathers
have
adored
under
three
different
forms
thou
who
displayest
thy
power
in
heaven
on
earth
and
in
the
underworld
thou
who
art
seen
foremost
among
the
nymphs
chasing
the
beasts
of
the
forest
cause
me
to
see
i
implore
thee
the
spot
where
my
dear
master
lies
and
make
me
all
my
life
long
follow
the
example
which
thou
dost
exhibit
of
works
of
charity
and
love
either
by
accident
or
that
the
moon
was
sensible
of
the
prayer
of
medoro
the
cloud
broke
away
and
the
moonlight
burst
forth
as
bright
as
day
the
rays
seemed
especially
to
gild
the
spot
where
lay
the
body
of
prince
dardinel
and
medoro
bathed
in
tears
and
with
bleeding
heart
recognized
him
by
the
quarterings
of
red
and
white
on
his
shield
with
groans
stifled
by
his
tears
and
lamentations
in
accents
suppressed
not
from
any
fear
for
himself
for
he
cared
not
for
life
but
lest
any
one
should
be
roused
to
interrupt
their
pious
duty
while
yet
incomplete
he
proposed
to
his
companion
that
they
should
together
bear
dardinel
on
their
shoulders
sharing
the
burden
of
the
beloved
remains
marching
with
rapid
strides
under
their
precious
load
they
perceived
that
the
stars
began
to
grow
pale
and
that
the
shades
of
night
would
soon
be
dispersed
by
the
dawn
just
then
zerbino
whose
extreme
valor
had
urged
him
far
from
the
camp
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitives
returning
entered
the
wood
in
which
they
were
some
knights
in
his
train
perceived
at
a
distance
the
two
cloridan
saw
the
troop
and
observing
that
they
dispersed
themselves
over
the
plain
as
if
in
search
of
booty
told
medoro
to
lay
down
the
body
and
let
each
save
himself
by
flight
he
dropped
his
part
thinking
that
medoro
would
do
the
same
but
the
good
youth
loved
his
prince
too
well
to
abandon
him
and
continued
to
carry
his
load
singly
as
well
as
he
might
while
cloridan
made
his
escape
near
by
there
was
a
part
of
the
wood
tufted
as
if
nothing
but
wild
animals
had
ever
penetrated
it
the
unfortunate
youth
loaded
with
the
weight
of
his
dead
master
plunged
into
its
recesses
cloridan
when
he
perceived
that
he
had
evaded
his
foes
discovered
that
medoro
was
not
with
him
ah
exclaimed
he
how
could
i
dear
medoro
so
forget
myself
as
to
consult
my
own
safety
without
heeding
yours
so
saying
he
retraced
the
tangled
passes
of
the
wood
toward
the
place
from
whence
he
had
fled
as
he
approached
he
heard
the
noise
of
horses
and
the
menacing
voices
of
armed
men
soon
he
perceived
medoro
on
foot
with
the
cavaliers
surrounding
him
zerbino
their
commander
bade
them
seize
him
the
unhappy
medoro
turned
now
this
way
now
that
trying
to
conceal
himself
behind
an
oak
or
a
rock
still
bearing
the
body
which
he
would
by
no
means
leave
cloridan
not
knowing
how
to
help
him
but
resolved
to
perish
with
him
if
he
must
perish
takes
an
arrow
fits
it
to
his
bow
discharges
it
and
pierces
the
breast
of
a
christian
knight
who
falls
helpless
from
his
horse
the
others
look
this
way
and
that
to
discover
whence
the
fatal
bolt
was
sped
one
while
demanding
of
his
comrades
in
what
direction
the
arrow
came
received
a
second
in
his
throat
which
stopped
his
words
and
soon
closed
his
eyes
to
the
scene
zerbino
furious
at
the
death
of
his
two
comrades
ran
upon
medoro
seized
his
golden
hair
and
dragged
him
forward
to
slay
him
but
the
sight
of
so
much
youth
and
beauty
commanded
pity
he
stayed
his
arm
the
young
man
spoke
in
suppliant
tones
ah
signor
said
he
i
conjure
you
by
the
god
whom
you
serve
deprive
me
not
of
life
until
i
shall
have
buried
the
body
of
the
prince
my
master
fear
not
that
i
will
ask
you
any
other
favor
life
is
not
dear
to
me
i
desire
death
as
soon
as
i
shall
have
performed
this
sacred
duty
do
with
me
then
as
you
please
give
my
limbs
a
prey
to
the
birds
and
beasts
only
let
me
first
bury
my
prince
medoro
pronounced
these
words
with
an
air
so
sweet
and
tender
that
a
heart
of
stone
would
have
been
moved
by
them
zerbino
was
so
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
he
was
on
the
point
of
uttering
words
of
mercy
when
a
cruel
subaltern
forgetting
all
respect
to
his
commander
plunged
his
lance
into
the
breast
of
the
young
moor
zerbino
enraged
at
his
brutality
turned
upon
the
wretch
to
take
vengeance
but
he
saved
himself
by
a
precipitate
flight
cloridan
who
saw
medoro
fall
could
contain
himself
no
longer
he
rushed
from
his
concealment
threw
down
his
bow
and
sword
in
hand
seemed
only
desirous
of
vengeance
for
medoro
and
to
die
with
him
in
a
moment
pierced
through
and
through
with
many
wounds
he
exerts
the
last
remnant
of
his
strength
in
dragging
himself
to
medoro
to
die
embracing
him
the
cavaliers
left
them
thus
to
rejoin
zerbino
whose
rage
against
the
murderer
of
medoro
had
drawn
him
away
from
the
spot
cloridan
died
and
medoro
bleeding
copiously
was
drawing
near
his
end
when
help
arrived
a
young
maiden
approached
the
fallen
knights
at
this
critical
moment
her
dress
was
that
of
a
but
her
air
was
noble
and
her
beauty
celestial
sweetness
and
goodness
reigned
in
her
lovely
countenance
it
was
no
other
than
angelica
the
princess
of
cathay
when
she
had
recovered
that
precious
ring
as
we
have
before
related
angelica
knowing
its
value
felt
proud
in
the
power
it
conferred
travelled
alone
without
fear
not
without
a
secret
shame
that
she
had
ever
been
obliged
to
seek
protection
in
her
wanderings
of
the
count
orlando
and
of
sacripant
she
reproached
herself
too
as
with
a
weakness
that
she
had
ever
thought
of
marrying
rinaldo
in
fine
her
pride
grew
so
high
as
to
persuade
her
that
no
man
living
was
worthy
to
aspire
to
her
hand
moved
with
pity
at
the
sight
of
the
young
man
wounded
and
melted
to
tears
at
hearing
the
cause
she
quickly
recalled
to
remembrance
the
knowledge
she
had
acquired
in
india
where
the
virtues
of
plants
and
the
art
of
healing
formed
part
of
the
education
even
of
princesses
the
beautiful
queen
ran
into
the
adjoining
meadow
to
gather
plants
of
virtue
to
staunch
the
flow
of
blood
meeting
on
her
way
a
countryman
on
horseback
seeking
a
strayed
heifer
she
begged
him
to
come
to
her
assistance
and
endeavor
to
remove
the
wounded
man
to
a
more
secure
asylum
angelica
having
prepared
the
plants
by
bruising
them
between
two
stones
laid
them
with
her
fair
hand
on
medoro
wound
the
remedy
soon
restored
in
some
degree
the
strength
of
the
wounded
man
who
before
he
would
quit
the
spot
made
them
cover
with
earth
and
turf
the
bodies
of
his
friend
and
of
the
prince
then
surrendering
himself
to
the
pity
of
his
deliverers
he
allowed
them
to
place
him
on
the
horse
of
the
shepherd
and
conduct
him
to
his
cottage
it
was
a
pleasant
farmhouse
on
the
borders
of
the
wood
bearing
marks
of
comfort
and
competency
there
the
shepherd
lived
with
his
wife
and
children
there
angelica
tended
medoro
and
there
by
the
devoted
care
of
the
beautiful
queen
his
sad
wound
closed
over
and
he
recovered
his
perfect
health
o
count
rinaldo
o
king
sacripant
what
availed
it
you
to
possess
so
many
virtues
and
such
fame
what
advantage
have
you
derived
from
all
your
high
deserts
o
hapless
king
great
agrican
if
you
could
return
to
life
how
would
you
endure
to
see
yourself
rejected
by
one
who
will
bow
to
the
yoke
of
hymen
in
favor
of
a
young
soldier
of
humble
birth
and
thou
ferrau
and
ye
numerous
others
who
a
hundred
times
have
put
your
lives
at
hazard
for
this
cruel
beauty
how
bitter
will
it
be
to
you
to
see
her
sacrifice
you
all
to
the
claims
of
the
humble
medoro
there
under
the
low
roof
of
a
shepherd
the
flame
of
hymen
was
lighted
for
this
haughty
queen
she
takes
the
shepherd
wife
to
serve
in
place
of
mother
the
shepherd
and
his
children
for
witnesses
and
marries
the
happy
medoro
angelica
after
her
marriage
wishing
to
endow
medoro
with
the
sovereignty
of
the
countries
which
yet
remained
to
her
took
with
him
the
road
to
the
east
she
had
preserved
through
all
her
adventures
a
bracelet
of
gold
enriched
with
precious
stones
the
present
of
the
count
orlando
having
nothing
else
wherewith
to
reward
the
good
shepherd
and
his
wife
who
had
served
her
with
so
much
care
and
fidelity
she
took
the
bracelet
from
her
arm
and
gave
it
to
them
and
then
the
couple
directed
their
steps
toward
those
mountains
which
separate
france
and
spain
intending
to
wait
at
barcelona
a
vessel
which
should
take
them
on
their
way
to
the
east
orlando
mad
orlando
on
the
loss
of
angelica
laid
aside
his
crest
and
arms
and
arrayed
himself
in
a
suit
of
black
armor
expressive
of
his
despair
in
this
guise
he
carried
such
slaughter
among
the
ranks
of
the
infidels
that
both
armies
were
astonished
at
the
achievements
of
the
stranger
knight
mandricardo
who
had
been
absent
from
the
battle
heard
the
report
of
these
achievements
and
determined
to
test
for
himself
the
valor
of
the
knight
so
extolled
he
it
was
who
broke
in
upon
the
conference
of
zerbino
and
isabella
and
their
benefactor
orlando
as
they
stood
occupied
in
mutual
felicitations
after
the
happy
reunion
of
the
lovers
by
the
prowess
of
the
paladin
mandricardo
after
contemplating
the
group
for
a
moment
addressed
himself
to
orlando
in
these
words
thou
must
be
the
man
i
seek
for
ten
days
and
more
i
have
been
on
thy
track
the
fame
of
thy
exploits
has
brought
me
hither
that
i
may
measure
my
strength
with
thine
thy
crest
and
shield
prove
thee
the
same
who
spread
such
slaughter
among
our
troops
but
these
marks
are
superfluous
and
if
i
saw
thee
among
a
hundred
i
should
know
thee
by
thy
martial
bearing
to
be
the
man
i
seek
i
respect
thy
courage
said
orlando
such
a
design
could
not
have
sprung
up
in
any
but
a
brave
and
generous
soul
if
the
desire
to
see
me
has
brought
thee
hither
i
would
if
it
were
possible
show
thee
my
inmost
soul
i
will
remove
my
visor
that
you
may
satisfy
your
curiosity
but
when
you
have
done
so
i
hope
that
you
will
also
try
and
see
if
my
valor
corresponds
to
my
appearance
come
on
said
the
saracen
my
first
wish
was
to
see
and
know
thee
i
will
not
gratify
my
second
orlando
observing
mandricardo
was
surprised
to
see
no
sword
at
his
side
nor
mace
at
his
and
what
weapon
hast
thou
said
he
if
thy
lance
fail
thee
do
not
concern
yourself
about
that
said
mandricardo
i
have
made
many
good
knights
give
ground
with
no
other
weapon
than
you
see
know
that
i
have
sworn
an
oath
never
to
bear
a
sword
until
i
win
back
that
famous
durindana
that
orlando
the
paladin
carries
that
sword
belongs
to
the
suit
of
armor
which
i
wear
that
only
is
wanting
without
doubt
it
was
stolen
but
how
it
got
into
the
hands
of
orlando
i
know
not
but
i
will
make
him
pay
dearly
for
it
when
i
find
him
i
seek
him
the
more
anxiously
that
i
may
avenge
with
his
blood
the
death
of
king
agrican
my
father
whom
he
treacherously
slew
i
am
sure
he
must
have
done
it
by
treachery
for
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
subdue
in
fair
fight
such
a
warrior
as
my
father
thou
liest
cried
orlando
and
all
who
say
so
lie
i
am
orlando
whom
you
seek
yes
i
am
he
who
slew
your
father
honorably
hold
here
is
the
sword
you
shall
have
it
if
your
courage
avails
to
merit
it
though
it
belongs
to
me
by
right
i
will
not
use
it
in
this
dispute
see
i
hang
it
on
this
tree
you
shall
be
master
of
it
if
you
bereave
me
of
life
not
else
at
these
words
orlando
drew
durindana
and
hung
it
on
one
of
the
branches
of
a
tree
near
by
both
knights
boiling
with
equal
ardor
rode
off
in
a
semicircle
then
rushed
together
with
reins
thrown
loose
and
struck
one
another
with
their
lances
both
kept
their
seats
immovable
the
splinters
of
their
lances
flew
into
the
air
and
no
weapon
remained
for
either
but
the
fragment
which
he
held
in
his
hand
then
those
two
knights
covered
with
iron
mail
were
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
fighting
with
staves
in
the
manner
of
two
rustics
who
dispute
the
boundary
of
a
meadow
or
the
possession
of
a
spring
these
clubs
could
not
long
keep
whole
in
the
hands
of
such
sturdy
smiters
who
were
soon
reduced
to
fight
with
naked
fists
such
warfare
was
more
painful
to
him
that
gave
than
to
him
that
received
the
blows
they
next
clasped
and
strained
each
his
adversary
as
hercules
did
antaeus
mandricardo
more
enraged
than
orlando
made
violent
efforts
to
unseat
the
paladin
and
dropped
the
rein
of
his
horse
orlando
more
calm
perceived
it
with
one
hand
he
resisted
mandricardo
with
the
other
he
twitched
the
horse
bridle
over
the
ears
of
the
animal
the
saracen
dragged
orlando
with
all
his
might
but
orlando
thighs
held
the
saddle
like
a
vise
at
last
the
efforts
of
the
saracen
broke
the
girths
of
orlando
horse
the
saddle
slipped
the
knight
firm
in
his
stirrups
slipped
with
it
and
came
to
the
ground
hardly
conscious
of
his
fall
the
noise
of
his
armor
in
falling
startled
mandricardo
horse
now
without
a
bridle
he
started
off
in
full
career
heeding
neither
trees
nor
rocks
nor
broken
ground
urged
by
fright
he
ran
with
furious
speed
carrying
his
master
who
almost
distracted
with
rage
shouted
and
beat
the
animal
with
his
fists
and
thereby
impelled
his
flight
after
running
thus
three
miles
or
more
a
deep
ditch
opposed
their
progress
the
horse
and
rider
fell
headlong
into
it
and
did
not
find
the
bottom
covered
with
or
roses
they
got
sadly
bruised
but
were
lucky
enough
to
escape
without
any
broken
limbs
mandricardo
as
soon
as
he
gained
his
feet
seized
the
horse
by
his
mane
with
fury
but
having
no
bridle
could
not
hold
him
he
looked
round
in
hopes
of
finding
something
that
would
do
for
a
rein
just
then
fortune
who
seemed
willing
to
help
him
at
last
brought
that
way
a
peasant
with
a
bridle
in
his
hand
who
was
in
search
of
his
farm
horse
that
had
strayed
away
orlando
having
speedily
repaired
his
horse
girths
remounted
and
waited
a
good
hour
for
the
saracen
to
return
not
seeing
him
he
concluded
to
go
in
search
of
him
he
took
an
affectionate
leave
of
zerbino
and
isabella
who
would
willingly
have
followed
him
but
this
the
brave
paladin
would
by
no
means
permit
he
held
it
unknightly
to
go
in
search
of
an
enemy
accompanied
by
a
friend
who
might
act
as
a
defender
therefore
desiring
them
to
say
to
mandricardo
if
they
should
meet
him
that
his
purpose
was
to
tarry
in
the
neighborhood
three
days
and
then
repair
to
the
camp
of
charlemagne
he
took
down
durindana
from
the
tree
and
proceeded
in
the
direction
which
the
saracen
horse
had
taken
but
the
animal
having
no
guide
but
its
terror
had
so
doubled
and
confused
its
traces
that
orlando
after
two
days
spent
in
the
search
gave
up
the
attempt
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
third
day
when
the
paladin
arrived
on
the
pleasant
bank
of
a
stream
which
wound
through
a
meadow
enamelled
with
flowers
high
trees
whose
tops
met
and
formed
an
arbor
the
fountain
and
the
breeze
which
blew
through
their
foliage
tempered
the
heat
hither
the
shepherds
used
to
resort
to
quench
their
thirst
and
to
enjoy
the
shelter
from
the
midday
sun
the
air
perfumed
with
the
flowers
seemed
to
breathe
fresh
strength
into
their
veins
orlando
felt
the
influence
though
covered
with
his
armor
he
stopped
in
this
delicious
arbor
where
everything
seemed
to
invite
to
repose
but
he
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
fatal
asylum
he
there
spent
the
most
miserable
moments
of
his
life
he
looked
around
and
noted
with
pleasure
all
the
charms
of
the
spot
he
saw
that
some
of
the
trees
were
carved
with
inscriptions
he
drew
near
and
read
them
and
what
was
his
surprise
to
find
that
they
composed
the
name
of
angelica
farther
on
he
found
the
name
of
medoro
mixed
with
hers
the
paladin
thought
he
dreamed
he
stood
like
one
amazed
like
a
bird
that
rising
to
fly
finds
its
feet
caught
in
a
net
orlando
followed
the
course
of
the
stream
and
came
to
one
of
its
turns
where
the
rocks
of
the
mountain
bent
in
such
a
way
as
to
form
a
sort
of
grotto
the
twisted
stems
of
ivy
and
the
wild
vine
draped
the
entrance
of
this
recess
scooped
by
the
hand
of
nature
the
unhappy
paladin
on
entering
the
grotto
saw
letters
which
appeared
to
have
been
lately
carved
they
were
verses
which
medoro
had
written
in
honor
of
his
happy
nuptials
with
the
beautiful
queen
orlando
tried
to
persuade
himself
it
must
be
some
other
angelica
whom
those
verses
celebrated
and
as
for
medoro
he
had
never
heard
his
name
the
sun
was
now
declining
and
orlando
remounted
his
horse
and
went
on
his
way
he
soon
saw
the
roof
of
a
cottage
whence
the
smoke
ascended
he
heard
the
barking
of
dogs
and
the
lowing
of
cattle
and
arrived
at
a
humble
dwelling
which
seemed
to
offer
an
asylum
for
the
night
the
inmates
as
soon
as
they
saw
him
hastened
to
tender
him
service
one
took
his
horse
another
his
shield
and
cuirass
another
his
golden
spurs
this
cottage
was
the
very
same
where
medoro
had
been
carried
deeply
wounded
where
angelica
had
tended
him
and
afterwards
married
him
the
shepherd
who
lived
in
it
loved
to
tell
everybody
the
story
of
this
marriage
and
soon
related
it
with
all
its
details
to
the
miserable
orlando
having
finished
it
he
went
away
and
returned
with
the
precious
bracelet
which
angelica
grateful
for
his
services
had
given
him
as
a
memorial
it
was
the
one
which
orlando
had
himself
given
her
this
last
touch
was
the
finishing
stroke
to
the
excited
paladin
frantic
exasperated
he
exclaimed
against
the
ungrateful
and
cruel
princess
who
had
disdained
him
the
most
renowned
the
most
indomitable
of
all
the
paladins
of
france
him
who
had
rescued
her
from
the
most
alarming
perils
him
who
had
fought
the
most
terrible
battles
for
her
sake
she
to
prefer
to
him
a
young
saracen
the
pride
of
the
noble
count
was
deeply
wounded
indignant
frantic
a
victim
to
ungovernable
rage
he
rushed
into
the
forest
uttering
the
most
frightful
shrieks
no
no
cried
he
i
am
not
the
man
they
take
me
for
orlando
is
dead
i
am
only
the
wandering
ghost
of
that
unhappy
count
who
is
now
suffering
the
torments
of
hell
orlando
wandered
all
night
as
chance
directed
through
the
wood
and
at
sunrise
his
destiny
led
him
to
the
fountain
where
medoro
had
engraved
the
fatal
inscription
the
frantic
paladin
saw
it
a
second
time
with
fury
drew
his
sword
and
hacked
it
from
the
rock
unlucky
grotto
you
shall
no
more
attract
by
your
shade
and
coolness
you
shall
no
more
shelter
with
your
arch
either
shepherd
or
flock
and
you
fresh
and
pure
fountain
you
may
not
escape
the
rage
of
the
furious
orlando
he
cast
into
the
fountain
branches
trunks
of
trees
which
he
tore
up
pieces
of
rocks
which
he
broke
off
plants
uprooted
with
the
earth
adhering
and
turf
and
brushes
so
as
to
choke
the
fountain
and
destroy
the
purity
of
its
waters
at
length
exhausted
by
his
violent
exertions
bathed
in
sweat
breathless
orlando
sunk
panting
upon
the
earth
and
lay
there
insensible
three
days
and
three
nights
the
fourth
day
he
started
up
and
seized
his
arms
his
helmet
his
buckler
he
cast
far
from
him
his
hauberk
and
his
clothes
he
rent
asunder
the
fragments
were
scattered
through
the
wood
in
fine
he
became
a
furious
madman
his
insanity
was
such
that
he
cared
not
to
retain
even
his
sword
but
he
had
no
need
of
durindana
nor
of
other
arms
to
do
wonderful
things
his
prodigious
strength
sufficed
at
the
first
wrench
of
his
mighty
arm
he
tore
up
a
tree
by
the
roots
oaks
beeches
maples
whatever
he
met
in
his
path
yielded
in
like
manner
the
ancient
forest
soon
became
as
bare
as
the
borders
of
a
morass
where
the
fowler
has
cleared
away
the
bushes
to
spread
his
nets
the
shepherds
hearing
the
horrible
crashing
in
the
forest
abandoned
their
flocks
to
run
and
see
the
cause
of
this
unwonted
uproar
by
their
evil
star
or
for
their
sins
they
were
led
thither
when
they
saw
the
furious
state
the
count
was
in
and
his
incredible
force
they
would
fain
have
fled
out
of
his
reach
but
in
their
fears
lost
their
presence
of
mind
the
madman
pursued
them
seized
one
and
rent
him
limb
from
limb
as
easily
as
one
would
pull
ripe
apples
from
a
tree
he
took
another
by
the
feet
and
used
him
as
a
club
to
knock
down
a
third
the
shepherds
fled
but
it
would
have
been
hard
for
any
to
escape
if
he
had
not
at
that
moment
left
them
to
throw
himself
with
the
same
fury
upon
their
flocks
the
peasants
abandoning
their
ploughs
and
harrows
mounted
on
the
roofs
of
buildings
and
pinnacles
of
the
rocks
afraid
to
trust
themselves
even
to
the
oaks
and
pines
from
such
heights
they
looked
on
trembling
at
the
raging
fury
of
the
unhappy
orlando
his
fists
his
teeth
his
nails
his
feet
seize
break
and
tear
cattle
sheep
and
swine
the
most
swift
in
flight
alone
being
able
to
escape
him
when
at
last
terror
had
scattered
everything
before
him
he
entered
a
cottage
which
was
abandoned
by
its
inhabitants
and
there
found
that
which
served
for
food
his
long
fast
had
caused
him
to
feel
the
most
ravenous
hunger
seizing
whatever
he
found
that
was
eatable
whether
roots
acorns
or
bread
raw
meat
or
cooked
he
gorged
it
indiscriminately
issuing
thence
again
the
frantic
orlando
gave
chase
to
whatever
living
thing
he
saw
whether
men
or
animals
sometimes
he
pursued
the
deer
and
hind
sometimes
he
attacked
bears
and
wolves
and
with
his
naked
hands
killed
and
tore
them
and
devoured
their
flesh
thus
he
wandered
from
place
to
place
through
france
imperilling
his
life
a
thousand
ways
yet
always
preserved
by
some
mysterious
providence
from
a
fatal
result
but
here
we
leave
orlando
for
a
time
that
we
may
record
what
befell
zerbino
and
isabella
after
their
parting
with
him
the
prince
and
his
fair
bride
waited
by
orlando
request
near
the
scene
of
the
battle
for
three
days
that
if
mandricardo
should
return
they
might
inform
him
where
orlando
would
give
him
another
meeting
at
the
end
of
that
time
their
anxiety
to
know
the
issue
led
them
to
follow
orlando
traces
which
led
them
at
last
to
the
wood
where
the
trees
were
inscribed
with
the
names
of
angelica
and
medoro
they
remarked
how
all
these
inscriptions
were
defaced
and
how
the
grotto
was
disordered
and
the
fountain
clogged
with
rubbish
but
that
which
surprised
them
and
distressed
them
most
of
all
was
to
find
on
the
grass
the
cuirass
of
orlando
and
not
far
from
it
his
helmet
the
same
which
the
renowned
almontes
once
wore
hearing
a
horse
neigh
in
the
forest
zerbino
turned
his
eyes
in
that
direction
and
saw
brigliadoro
with
the
bridle
yet
hanging
at
the
he
looked
round
for
durindana
and
found
that
famous
sword
without
the
scabbard
lying
on
the
grass
he
saw
also
the
fragments
of
orlando
other
arms
and
clothing
scattered
on
all
sides
over
the
plain
zerbino
and
isabella
stood
in
astonishment
and
grief
not
knowing
what
to
think
but
little
imagining
the
true
cause
if
they
had
found
any
marks
of
blood
on
the
arms
or
on
the
fragments
of
the
clothing
they
would
have
supposed
him
slain
but
there
were
none
while
they
were
in
this
painful
uncertainty
they
saw
a
young
peasant
approach
he
not
yet
recovered
from
the
terror
of
the
scene
which
he
had
witnessed
from
the
top
of
a
rock
told
them
the
whole
of
the
sad
events
zerbino
with
his
eyes
full
of
tears
carefully
collected
all
the
scattered
arms
isabella
also
dismounted
to
aid
him
in
the
sad
duty
when
they
had
collected
all
the
pieces
of
that
rich
armor
they
hung
them
like
a
trophy
on
a
pine
and
to
prevent
their
being
violated
by
any
zerbino
inscribed
on
the
bark
this
caution
these
are
the
arms
of
the
paladin
orlando
having
finished
this
pious
work
he
remounted
his
horse
and
just
then
a
knight
rode
up
and
requested
zerbino
to
tell
him
the
meaning
of
the
trophy
the
prince
related
the
facts
as
they
had
happened
and
mandricardo
for
it
was
that
saracen
knight
full
of
joy
rushed
forward
and
seized
the
sword
saying
no
one
can
censure
me
for
what
i
do
this
sword
is
mine
i
can
take
my
own
wherever
i
find
it
it
is
plain
that
orlando
not
daring
to
defend
it
against
me
has
counterfeited
madness
to
excuse
him
in
surrendering
it
zerbino
vehemently
exclaimed
touch
not
that
sword
think
not
to
possess
it
without
a
contest
if
it
be
true
that
the
arms
you
wear
are
those
of
hector
you
must
have
got
them
by
theft
and
not
by
prowess
immediately
they
attacked
one
another
with
the
utmost
fury
the
air
resounded
with
blows
zerbino
skilful
and
alert
evaded
for
a
time
with
good
success
the
strokes
of
durindana
but
at
length
a
terrible
blow
struck
him
on
the
neck
he
fell
from
his
horse
and
the
tartar
king
possessed
of
the
spoils
of
his
victory
rode
away
zerbino
and
isabella
zerbino
pain
at
seeing
the
tartar
prince
go
off
with
the
sword
surpassed
the
anguish
of
his
wound
but
now
the
loss
of
blood
so
reduced
his
strength
that
he
could
not
move
from
where
he
fell
isabella
not
knowing
whither
to
resort
for
help
could
only
bemoan
him
and
chide
her
cruel
fate
zerbino
said
if
i
could
but
leave
thee
my
best
beloved
in
some
secure
abode
it
would
not
distress
me
to
die
but
to
abandon
thee
so
without
protection
is
sad
indeed
she
replied
think
not
to
leave
me
dearest
our
souls
shall
not
be
parted
this
sword
will
give
me
the
means
to
follow
thee
zerbino
last
words
implored
her
to
banish
such
a
thought
but
live
and
be
true
to
his
memory
isabella
promised
with
many
tears
to
be
faithful
to
him
so
long
as
life
should
last
when
he
ceased
to
breathe
isabella
cries
resounded
through
the
forest
and
reached
the
ears
of
a
reverend
hermit
who
hastened
to
the
spot
he
soothed
and
calmed
her
urging
those
consolations
which
the
word
of
god
supplies
and
at
last
brought
her
to
wish
for
nothing
else
but
to
devote
herself
for
the
rest
of
life
wholly
to
religion
as
she
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
leaving
her
dead
lord
abandoned
the
body
was
by
the
good
hermit
aid
placed
upon
the
horse
and
taken
to
the
nearest
inhabited
place
where
a
chest
was
made
for
it
suitable
to
be
carried
with
them
on
their
way
the
hermit
plan
was
to
escort
his
charge
to
a
monastery
not
many
days
journey
distant
where
isabella
resolved
to
spend
the
remainder
of
her
days
thus
they
travelled
day
after
day
choosing
the
most
retired
ways
for
the
country
was
full
of
armed
men
one
day
a
cavalier
met
them
and
barred
their
way
it
was
no
other
than
rodomont
king
of
algiers
who
had
just
left
the
camp
of
agramant
full
of
indignation
at
the
treatment
he
had
received
from
doralice
at
sight
of
the
lovely
lady
and
her
reverend
attendant
with
their
horse
laden
with
a
burden
draped
with
black
he
asked
the
meaning
of
their
journey
isabella
told
him
her
affliction
and
her
resolution
to
renounce
the
world
and
devote
herself
to
religion
and
to
the
memory
of
the
friend
she
had
lost
rodomont
laughed
scornfully
at
this
and
told
her
that
her
project
was
absurd
that
charms
like
hers
were
meant
to
be
enjoyed
not
buried
and
that
he
himself
would
more
than
make
amends
for
her
dead
lover
the
monk
who
promptly
interposed
to
rebuke
this
impious
talk
was
commanded
to
hold
his
peace
and
still
persisting
was
seized
by
the
knight
and
hurled
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
where
he
fell
into
the
sea
and
was
drowned
rodomont
when
he
had
got
rid
of
the
hermit
again
applied
to
the
sad
lady
heartless
with
affright
and
in
the
language
used
by
lovers
said
she
was
his
very
heart
his
life
his
light
having
laid
aside
all
violence
he
humbly
sued
that
she
would
accompany
him
to
his
retreat
near
by
it
was
a
ruined
chapel
from
which
the
monks
had
been
driven
by
the
disorders
of
the
time
and
which
rodomont
had
taken
possession
of
isabella
who
had
no
choice
but
to
obey
followed
him
meditating
as
she
went
what
resource
she
could
find
to
escape
out
of
his
power
and
keep
her
vow
to
her
dead
husband
to
be
faithful
to
his
memory
as
long
as
life
should
last
at
length
she
said
if
my
lord
you
will
let
me
go
and
fulfil
my
vow
and
my
intention
as
i
have
already
declared
it
i
will
bestow
upon
you
what
will
be
to
you
of
more
value
than
a
hundred
women
hearts
i
know
an
herb
and
i
have
seen
it
on
our
way
which
rightly
prepared
affords
a
juice
of
such
power
that
the
flesh
if
laved
with
it
becomes
impenetrable
to
sword
or
fire
this
liquor
i
can
make
and
will
if
you
will
accept
my
offer
and
when
you
have
seen
its
virtue
you
will
value
it
more
than
if
all
europe
were
made
your
own
rodomont
at
hearing
this
readily
promised
all
that
was
asked
so
eager
was
he
to
learn
a
secret
that
would
make
him
as
achilles
was
of
yore
isabella
having
collected
such
herbs
as
she
thought
proper
and
boiled
them
with
certain
mysterious
signs
and
words
at
length
declared
her
labor
done
and
as
a
test
offered
to
try
its
virtue
on
herself
she
bathed
her
neck
and
bosom
with
the
liquor
and
then
called
on
rodomont
to
smite
with
all
his
force
and
see
whether
his
sword
had
power
to
harm
the
pagan
who
during
the
preparations
had
taken
frequent
draughts
of
wine
and
scarce
knew
what
he
did
drew
his
sword
at
the
word
and
struck
across
her
neck
with
all
his
might
and
the
fair
head
leapt
sundered
from
the
snowy
neck
and
breast
rude
and
unfeeling
as
he
was
the
pagan
knight
lamented
bitterly
this
sad
result
to
honor
her
memory
he
resolved
to
do
a
work
as
unparalleled
as
her
devotion
from
all
parts
round
he
caused
laborers
to
be
brought
and
had
a
tower
built
to
enclose
the
chapel
within
which
the
remains
of
zerbino
and
isabella
were
entombed
across
the
stream
which
flowed
near
by
he
built
a
bridge
scarce
two
yards
wide
and
added
neither
parapet
nor
rail
on
the
top
of
the
tower
a
sentry
was
placed
who
when
any
traveller
approached
the
bridge
gave
notice
to
his
master
rodomont
thereupon
sallied
out
and
defied
the
approaching
knight
to
fight
him
upon
the
bridge
where
any
chance
step
a
little
aside
would
plunge
the
rider
headlong
in
the
stream
this
bridge
he
vowed
to
keep
until
a
thousand
suits
of
armor
should
be
won
from
conquered
knights
wherewith
to
build
a
trophy
to
his
victim
and
her
lord
within
ten
days
the
bridge
was
built
and
the
tower
was
in
progress
in
a
short
time
many
knights
either
seeking
the
shortest
route
or
tempted
by
a
desire
of
adventure
had
made
the
attempt
to
pass
the
bridge
all
without
exception
had
lost
either
arms
or
life
or
both
some
falling
before
lance
others
precipitated
into
the
river
one
day
as
rodomont
stood
urging
his
workmen
it
chanced
that
orlando
in
his
furious
mood
came
thither
and
approached
the
bridge
rodomont
halloed
to
him
halt
churl
presume
not
to
set
foot
upon
that
bridge
it
was
not
made
for
such
as
you
orlando
took
no
notice
but
pressed
on
just
then
a
gentle
damsel
rode
up
it
was
flordelis
who
was
seeking
her
florismart
she
saw
orlando
and
in
spite
of
his
strange
appearance
recognized
him
rodomont
not
used
to
have
his
commands
disobeyed
laid
hands
on
the
madman
and
would
have
thrown
him
into
the
river
but
to
his
astonishment
found
himself
in
the
gripe
of
one
not
so
easily
disposed
of
how
can
a
fool
have
such
strength
he
growled
between
his
teeth
flordelis
stopped
to
see
the
issue
where
each
of
these
two
puissant
warriors
strove
to
throw
the
other
from
the
bridge
orlando
at
last
had
strength
enough
to
lift
his
foe
with
all
his
armor
and
fling
him
over
the
side
but
had
not
wit
to
clear
himself
from
him
so
both
fell
together
high
flashed
the
wave
as
they
together
smote
its
surface
here
orlando
had
the
advantage
he
was
naked
and
could
swim
like
a
fish
he
soon
reached
the
bank
and
careless
of
praise
or
blame
stopped
not
to
see
what
came
of
the
adventure
rodomont
entangled
with
his
armor
escaped
with
difficulty
to
the
bank
meantime
flordelis
passed
the
bridge
unchallenged
after
long
wandering
without
success
she
returned
to
paris
and
there
found
the
object
of
her
search
for
florismart
after
the
fall
of
albracca
had
repaired
thither
the
joy
of
meeting
was
clouded
to
florismart
by
the
news
which
flordelis
brought
of
orlando
wretched
plight
the
last
she
had
seen
of
him
was
when
he
fell
with
rodomont
into
the
stream
florismart
who
loved
orlando
like
a
brother
resolved
to
set
out
immediately
under
the
guidance
of
the
lady
to
find
him
and
bring
him
where
he
might
receive
the
treatment
suited
to
his
case
a
few
days
brought
them
to
the
place
where
they
found
the
tartar
king
still
guarding
the
bridge
the
usual
challenge
and
defiance
was
made
and
the
knights
rode
to
encounter
one
another
on
the
bridge
at
the
first
encounter
both
horses
were
overthrown
and
having
no
space
to
regain
their
footing
fell
with
their
riders
into
the
water
rodomont
who
knew
the
soundings
of
the
stream
soon
recovered
the
land
but
florismart
was
carried
downward
by
the
current
and
landed
at
last
on
a
bank
of
mud
where
his
horse
could
hardly
find
footing
flordelis
who
watched
the
battle
from
the
bridge
seeing
her
lover
in
this
piteous
case
exclaimed
aloud
ah
rodomont
for
love
of
her
whom
dead
you
honor
have
pity
on
me
who
love
this
knight
and
slay
him
not
let
it
suffice
he
yields
his
armor
to
the
pile
and
none
more
glorious
will
it
bear
than
his
her
prayer
so
well
directed
touched
the
pagan
heart
though
hard
to
move
and
he
lent
his
aid
to
help
the
knight
to
land
he
kept
him
a
prisoner
however
and
added
his
armor
to
the
pile
flordelis
with
a
heavy
heart
went
her
way
we
must
now
return
to
rogero
who
when
we
parted
with
him
was
engaged
in
an
adventure
which
arrested
his
progress
to
the
monastery
whither
he
was
bound
with
the
intention
of
receiving
baptism
and
thus
qualifying
himself
to
demand
bradamante
as
his
bride
on
his
way
he
met
with
mandricardo
and
the
quarrel
was
revived
respecting
the
right
to
wear
the
badge
of
hector
after
a
warm
discussion
both
parties
agreed
to
submit
the
question
to
king
agramant
and
for
that
purpose
took
their
way
to
the
saracen
camp
here
they
met
gradasso
who
had
his
controversy
also
with
mandricardo
this
warrior
claimed
the
sword
of
orlando
denying
the
right
of
mandricardo
to
possess
it
in
virtue
of
his
having
found
it
abandoned
by
its
owner
king
agramant
strove
in
vain
to
reconcile
these
quarrels
and
was
forced
at
last
to
consent
that
the
points
in
dispute
should
be
settled
by
one
combat
in
which
mandricardo
should
meet
one
of
the
other
champions
to
whom
should
be
committed
the
cause
of
both
rogero
was
chosen
by
lot
to
maintain
gradasso
cause
and
his
own
great
preparations
were
made
for
this
signal
contest
on
the
appointed
day
it
was
fought
in
the
presence
of
agramant
and
of
the
whole
army
rogero
won
it
and
mandricardo
the
conqueror
of
hector
arms
the
challenger
of
orlando
and
the
slayer
of
zerbino
lost
his
life
gradasso
received
durindana
as
his
prize
which
lost
half
its
value
in
his
eyes
since
it
was
won
by
another
prowess
not
his
own
rogero
though
victorious
was
severely
wounded
and
lay
helpless
many
weeks
in
the
camp
of
agramant
while
bradamante
ignorant
of
the
cause
of
his
delay
expected
him
at
montalban
thither
he
had
promised
to
repair
in
fifteen
days
or
twenty
at
furthest
hoping
to
have
obtained
by
that
time
an
honorable
discharge
from
his
obligations
to
the
saracen
commander
the
twenty
days
were
passed
and
a
month
more
and
still
rogero
came
not
nor
did
any
tidings
reach
bradamante
accounting
for
his
absence
at
the
end
of
that
time
a
wandering
knight
brought
news
of
the
famous
combat
and
of
rogero
wound
he
added
what
alarmed
bradamante
still
more
that
marphisa
a
female
warrior
young
and
fair
was
in
attendance
on
the
wounded
knight
he
added
that
the
whole
army
expected
that
as
soon
as
rogero
wounds
were
healed
the
pair
would
be
united
in
marriage
bradamante
distressed
by
this
news
though
she
believed
it
but
in
part
resolved
to
go
immediately
and
see
for
herself
she
mounted
rabican
the
horse
of
astolpho
which
he
had
committed
to
her
care
and
took
with
her
the
lance
of
gold
though
unaware
of
its
wonderful
powers
thus
accoutred
she
left
the
castle
and
took
the
road
toward
paris
and
the
camp
of
the
saracens
marphisa
whose
devotion
to
rogero
in
his
illness
had
so
excited
the
jealousy
of
bradamante
was
the
twin
sister
of
rogero
she
with
him
had
been
taken
in
charge
when
an
infant
by
atlantes
the
magician
but
while
yet
a
child
she
had
been
stolen
away
by
an
arab
tribe
adopted
by
their
chief
she
had
early
learned
horsemanship
and
skill
in
arms
and
at
this
time
had
come
to
the
camp
of
agramant
with
no
other
view
than
to
see
and
test
for
herself
the
prowess
of
the
warriors
of
either
camp
whose
fame
rang
through
the
world
arriving
at
the
very
moment
of
the
late
encounter
the
name
of
rogero
and
some
few
facts
of
his
story
which
she
learned
were
enough
to
suggest
the
idea
that
it
was
her
brother
whom
she
saw
victorious
in
the
single
combat
inquiry
satisfied
the
two
of
their
near
kindred
and
from
that
moment
marphisa
devoted
herself
to
the
care
of
her
and
loved
brother
in
those
moments
of
seclusion
rogero
informed
his
sister
of
what
he
had
learned
of
their
parentage
from
old
atlantes
rogero
their
father
a
christian
knight
had
won
the
heart
of
galaciella
daughter
of
the
sultan
of
africa
and
sister
of
king
agramant
converted
her
to
the
christian
faith
and
secretly
married
her
the
sultan
enraged
at
his
daughter
marriage
drove
her
husband
into
exile
and
caused
her
with
her
infant
children
rogero
and
marphisa
to
be
placed
in
a
boat
and
committed
to
the
winds
and
waves
to
perish
from
which
fate
they
were
saved
by
atlantes
on
hearing
this
marphisa
exclaimed
how
can
you
brother
leave
our
parents
unavenged
so
long
and
even
submit
to
serve
the
son
of
the
tyrant
who
so
wronged
them
rogero
replied
that
it
was
but
lately
he
had
learned
the
full
truth
that
when
he
learned
it
he
was
already
embarked
with
agramant
from
whom
he
had
received
knighthood
and
that
he
only
waited
for
a
suitable
opportunity
when
he
might
with
honor
desert
his
standard
and
at
the
same
time
return
to
the
faith
of
his
fathers
marphisa
hailed
this
resolution
with
joy
and
declared
her
intention
to
join
with
him
in
embracing
the
christian
faith
we
left
bradamante
when
mounted
on
rabican
and
armed
with
astolpho
lance
she
rode
forth
determined
to
learn
the
cause
of
rogero
long
absence
one
day
as
she
rode
she
met
a
damsel
of
visage
and
of
manners
fair
but
overcome
with
grief
it
was
flordelis
who
was
seeking
far
and
near
a
champion
capable
of
liberating
and
avenging
her
lord
flordelis
marked
the
approaching
warrior
and
judging
from
appearances
thought
she
had
found
the
champion
she
sought
are
you
sir
knight
she
said
so
daring
and
so
kind
as
to
take
up
my
cause
against
a
fierce
and
cruel
warrior
who
has
made
prisoner
of
my
lord
and
forced
me
thus
to
be
a
wanderer
and
a
suppliant
then
she
related
the
events
which
had
happened
at
the
bridge
bradamante
to
whom
noble
enterprises
were
always
welcome
readily
embraced
this
and
the
rather
as
in
her
gloomy
forebodings
she
felt
as
if
rogero
was
forever
lost
to
her
next
day
the
two
arrived
at
the
bridge
the
sentry
descried
them
approaching
and
gave
notice
to
his
lord
who
thereupon
donned
his
armor
and
went
forth
to
meet
them
here
as
usual
he
called
on
the
advancing
warrior
to
yield
his
horse
and
arms
an
oblation
to
the
tomb
bradamante
replied
asking
by
what
right
he
called
on
the
innocent
to
do
penance
for
his
crime
your
life
and
your
armor
she
added
are
the
fittest
offering
to
her
tomb
and
i
a
woman
the
fittest
champion
to
take
them
with
that
she
couched
her
spear
spurred
her
horse
and
ran
to
the
encounter
king
rodomont
came
on
with
speed
the
trampling
sounded
on
the
bridge
like
thunder
it
took
but
a
moment
to
decide
the
contest
the
golden
lance
did
its
office
and
that
fierce
moor
so
renowned
in
tourney
lay
extended
on
the
bridge
who
is
the
loser
now
said
bradamante
but
rodomont
amazed
that
a
woman
hand
should
have
laid
him
low
could
not
or
would
not
answer
silent
and
sad
he
raised
himself
unbound
his
helm
and
mail
and
flung
them
against
the
tomb
then
sullen
and
on
foot
left
the
ground
but
first
gave
orders
to
one
of
his
squires
to
release
all
his
prisoners
they
had
been
sent
off
to
africa
besides
florismart
there
were
sansonnet
and
oliver
who
had
ridden
that
way
in
quest
of
orlando
and
had
both
in
turn
been
overthrown
in
the
encounter
bradamante
after
her
victory
resumed
her
route
and
in
due
time
reached
the
christian
camp
where
she
readily
learned
an
explanation
of
the
mystery
which
had
caused
her
so
much
anxiety
rogero
and
his
fair
and
brave
sister
marphisa
were
too
illustrious
by
their
station
and
exploits
not
to
be
the
frequent
topic
of
discourse
even
among
their
adversaries
and
all
that
bradamante
was
anxious
to
know
reached
her
ear
almost
without
inquiry
we
now
return
to
gradasso
who
by
rogero
victory
had
been
made
possessor
of
durindana
there
now
only
remained
to
him
to
seek
the
horse
of
rinaldo
and
the
challenge
given
and
accepted
was
yet
to
be
fought
with
that
warrior
for
it
had
been
interrupted
by
the
arts
of
malagigi
gradasso
now
sought
another
meeting
with
rinaldo
and
met
with
no
reluctance
on
his
part
as
the
combat
was
for
the
possession
of
bayard
the
knights
dismounted
and
fought
on
foot
long
time
the
battle
lasted
rinaldo
knowing
well
the
deadly
stroke
of
durindana
used
all
his
art
to
parry
or
avoid
its
blow
gradasso
struck
with
might
and
main
but
wellnigh
all
his
strokes
were
spent
in
air
or
if
they
smote
they
fell
obliquely
and
did
little
harm
thus
had
they
fought
long
glancing
at
one
another
eyes
and
seeing
naught
else
when
their
attention
was
arrested
perforce
by
a
strange
noise
they
turned
and
beheld
the
good
bayard
attacked
by
a
monstrous
bird
perhaps
it
was
a
bird
for
such
it
seemed
but
when
or
where
such
a
bird
was
ever
seen
i
have
nowhere
read
except
in
turpin
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
it
was
not
a
bird
but
a
fiend
evoked
from
underground
by
malagigi
and
thither
sent
on
purpose
to
interrupt
the
fight
whether
a
fiend
or
a
fowl
the
monster
flew
right
at
bayard
and
clapped
his
wings
in
his
face
thereat
the
steed
broke
loose
and
ran
madly
across
the
plain
pursued
by
the
bird
till
bayard
plunged
into
the
wood
and
was
lost
to
sight
rinaldo
and
gradasso
seeing
bayard
escape
agreed
to
suspend
their
battle
till
they
could
recover
the
horse
the
object
of
contention
gradasso
mounted
his
steed
and
followed
the
marks
of
bayard
into
the
forest
rinaldo
never
more
vexed
in
spirit
remained
at
the
spot
gradasso
having
promised
to
return
thither
with
the
horse
if
he
found
him
he
did
find
him
after
long
search
for
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
hear
him
neigh
thus
he
became
possessed
of
both
the
objects
for
which
he
had
led
an
army
from
his
own
country
and
invaded
france
he
did
not
forget
his
promise
to
bring
bayard
back
to
the
place
where
he
had
left
rinaldo
but
only
muttering
now
i
have
got
him
he
little
knows
me
who
expects
me
to
give
him
up
if
rinaldo
wants
the
horse
let
him
seek
him
in
india
as
i
have
sought
him
in
france
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
arles
where
his
vessels
lay
and
in
possession
of
the
two
objects
of
his
ambition
the
horse
and
the
sword
sailed
away
to
his
own
country
astolpho
in
abyssinia
when
we
last
parted
with
the
adventurous
paladin
astolpho
he
was
just
commencing
that
flight
over
the
countries
of
the
world
from
which
he
promised
himself
so
much
gratification
our
readers
are
aware
that
the
eagle
and
the
falcon
have
not
so
swift
a
flight
as
the
hippogriff
on
which
astolpho
rode
it
was
not
long
therefore
before
the
paladin
directing
his
course
toward
the
southeast
arrived
over
that
part
of
africa
where
the
great
river
nile
has
its
source
here
he
alighted
and
found
himself
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
capital
of
abyssinia
ruled
by
senapus
whose
riches
and
power
were
immense
his
palace
was
of
surpassing
splendor
the
bars
of
the
gates
the
hinges
and
locks
were
all
of
pure
gold
in
fact
this
metal
in
that
country
is
put
to
all
those
uses
for
which
we
employ
iron
it
is
so
common
that
they
prefer
for
ornamental
purposes
rock
crystal
of
which
all
the
columns
were
made
precious
stones
of
different
kinds
rubies
emeralds
sapphires
and
topazes
were
set
in
ornamental
designs
and
the
walls
and
ceilings
were
adorned
with
pearls
it
is
in
this
country
those
famous
balms
grow
of
which
there
are
some
few
plants
in
that
part
of
judaea
called
gilead
musk
ambergris
and
numerous
gums
so
precious
in
europe
are
here
in
their
native
climate
it
is
said
the
sultan
of
egypt
pays
a
vast
tribute
to
the
monarch
of
this
country
to
hire
him
not
to
cut
off
the
source
of
the
nile
which
he
might
easily
do
and
cause
the
river
to
flow
in
some
other
direction
thus
depriving
egypt
of
the
source
of
its
fertility
at
the
time
of
astolpho
arrival
in
his
dominions
this
monarch
was
in
great
affliction
in
spite
of
his
riches
and
the
precious
productions
of
his
country
he
was
in
danger
of
dying
of
hunger
he
was
a
prey
to
a
flock
of
obscene
birds
called
harpies
which
attacked
him
whenever
he
sat
at
meat
and
with
their
claws
snatched
tore
and
scattered
everything
overturning
the
vessels
devouring
the
food
and
infecting
what
they
left
with
their
filthy
touch
it
was
said
this
punishment
was
inflicted
upon
the
king
because
when
young
and
filled
with
pride
and
presumption
he
had
attempted
to
invade
with
an
army
the
terrestrial
paradise
which
is
situated
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
whence
the
nile
draws
its
source
nor
was
this
his
only
punishment
he
was
struck
blind
astolpho
on
arriving
in
the
dominions
of
this
monarch
hastened
to
pay
him
his
respects
king
senapus
received
him
graciously
and
ordered
a
splendid
repast
to
be
prepared
in
honor
of
his
arrival
while
the
guests
were
seated
at
table
astolpho
filling
the
place
of
dignity
at
the
king
right
hand
the
horrid
scream
of
the
harpies
was
heard
in
the
air
and
soon
they
approached
hovering
over
the
tables
seizing
the
food
from
the
dishes
and
overturning
everything
with
the
flapping
of
their
broad
wings
in
vain
the
guests
struck
at
them
with
knives
and
any
weapons
which
they
had
and
astolpho
drew
his
sword
and
gave
them
repeated
blows
which
seemed
to
have
no
more
effect
upon
them
than
if
their
bodies
had
been
made
of
tow
at
last
astolpho
thought
of
his
horn
he
first
gave
warning
to
the
king
and
his
guests
to
stop
their
ears
then
blew
a
blast
the
harpies
terrified
at
the
sound
flew
away
as
fast
as
their
wings
could
carry
them
the
paladin
mounted
his
hippogriff
and
pursued
them
blowing
his
horn
as
often
as
he
came
near
them
they
stretched
their
flight
towards
the
great
mountain
at
the
foot
of
which
there
is
a
cavern
which
is
thought
to
be
the
mouth
of
the
infernal
abodes
hither
those
horrid
birds
flew
as
if
to
their
home
having
seen
them
all
disappear
in
the
recess
astolpho
cared
not
to
pursue
them
farther
but
alighting
rolled
huge
stones
into
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
piled
branches
of
trees
therein
so
that
he
effectually
barred
their
passage
out
and
we
have
no
evidence
of
their
ever
having
been
seen
since
in
the
outer
air
after
this
labor
astolpho
refreshed
himself
by
bathing
in
a
fountain
whose
pure
waters
bubbled
from
a
cleft
of
the
rock
having
rested
awhile
an
earnest
desire
seized
him
of
ascending
the
mountain
which
towered
above
him
the
hippogriff
bore
him
swiftly
upwards
and
landed
him
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
which
he
found
to
be
an
extensive
plain
a
splendid
palace
rose
in
the
middle
of
this
plain
whose
walls
shone
with
such
brilliancy
that
mortal
eyes
could
hardly
bear
the
sight
astolpho
guided
the
winged
horse
towards
this
edifice
and
made
him
poise
himself
in
the
air
while
he
took
a
leisurely
survey
of
this
favored
spot
and
its
environs
it
seemed
as
if
nature
and
art
had
striven
with
one
another
to
see
which
could
do
the
most
for
its
embellishment
astolpho
on
approaching
the
edifice
saw
a
venerable
man
advance
to
meet
him
this
personage
was
clothed
in
a
long
vesture
as
white
as
snow
while
a
mantle
of
purple
covered
his
shoulders
and
hung
down
to
the
ground
a
white
beard
descended
to
his
middle
and
his
hair
of
the
same
color
overshadowed
his
shoulders
his
eyes
were
so
brilliant
that
astolpho
felt
persuaded
that
he
was
a
blessed
inhabitant
of
the
heavenly
mansions
the
sage
smiling
benignantly
upon
the
paladin
who
from
respect
had
dismounted
from
his
horse
said
to
him
noble
chevalier
know
that
it
is
by
the
divine
will
you
have
been
brought
to
the
terrestrial
paradise
your
mortal
nature
could
not
have
borne
to
scale
these
heights
and
reach
these
seats
of
bliss
if
it
were
not
the
will
of
heaven
that
you
should
be
instructed
in
the
means
to
succor
charles
and
to
sustain
the
glory
of
our
holy
faith
i
am
prepared
to
impart
the
needed
counsels
but
before
i
begin
let
me
welcome
you
to
our
sojourn
i
doubt
not
your
long
fast
and
distant
journey
have
given
you
a
good
appetite
the
aspect
of
the
venerable
man
filled
the
prince
with
admiration
but
his
surprise
ceased
when
he
learned
from
him
that
he
was
that
one
of
the
apostles
of
our
lord
to
whom
he
said
i
will
that
thou
tarry
till
i
come
john
conducting
astolpho
rejoined
his
companions
these
were
the
patriarch
enoch
and
the
prophet
elijah
neither
of
whom
had
yet
seen
his
dying
day
but
taken
from
our
lower
world
were
dwelling
in
a
region
of
peace
and
joy
in
a
climate
of
eternal
spring
till
the
last
trumpet
shall
sound
the
three
holy
inhabitants
of
the
terrestrial
paradise
received
astolpho
with
the
greatest
kindness
carried
him
to
a
pleasant
apartment
and
took
great
care
of
the
hippogriff
to
whom
they
gave
such
food
as
suited
him
while
to
the
prince
they
presented
fruits
so
delicious
that
he
felt
inclined
to
excuse
our
first
parents
for
their
sin
in
eating
them
without
permission
astolpho
having
recruited
his
strength
not
only
by
these
excellent
fruits
but
also
by
sweet
sleep
roused
himself
at
the
first
blush
of
dawn
and
as
soon
as
he
left
his
chamber
met
the
beloved
apostle
coming
to
seek
him
john
took
him
by
the
hand
and
told
him
many
things
relating
to
the
past
and
the
future
among
others
he
said
son
let
me
tell
you
what
is
now
going
on
in
france
orlando
the
illustrious
prince
who
received
at
his
birth
the
endowment
of
strength
and
courage
more
than
mortal
raised
up
as
was
samson
of
old
to
be
the
champion
of
the
true
faith
has
been
guilty
of
the
basest
ingratitude
in
leaving
the
christian
camp
when
it
most
needed
the
support
of
his
arm
to
run
after
a
saracen
princess
whom
he
would
fain
marry
though
she
scorns
him
to
punish
him
his
reason
has
been
taken
away
so
that
he
runs
naked
through
the
land
over
mountains
and
through
valleys
without
a
ray
of
intelligence
the
duration
of
his
punishment
has
been
fixed
at
three
months
and
that
time
having
nearly
expired
you
have
been
brought
hither
to
learn
from
us
the
means
by
which
the
reason
of
orlando
may
be
restored
true
you
will
be
obliged
to
make
a
journey
with
me
and
we
must
even
leave
the
earth
and
ascend
to
the
moon
for
it
is
in
that
planet
we
are
to
seek
the
remedy
for
the
madness
of
the
paladin
i
propose
to
make
our
journey
this
evening
as
soon
as
the
moon
appears
over
our
head
as
soon
as
the
sun
sunk
beneath
the
seas
and
the
moon
presented
its
luminous
disk
the
holy
man
had
the
chariot
brought
out
in
which
he
was
accustomed
to
make
excursions
among
the
stars
the
same
which
was
employed
long
ago
to
convey
elijah
up
from
earth
the
saint
made
astolpho
seat
himself
beside
him
took
the
reins
and
giving
the
word
to
the
coursers
they
bore
them
upward
with
astonishing
celerity
at
length
they
reached
the
great
continent
of
the
moon
its
surface
appeared
to
be
of
polished
steel
with
here
and
there
a
spot
which
like
rust
obscured
its
brightness
the
paladin
was
astonished
to
see
that
the
earth
with
all
its
seas
and
rivers
seemed
but
an
insignificant
spot
in
the
distance
the
prince
discovered
in
this
region
so
new
to
him
rivers
lakes
plains
hills
and
valleys
many
beautiful
cities
and
castles
enriched
the
landscape
he
saw
also
vast
forests
and
heard
in
them
the
sound
of
horns
and
the
barking
of
dogs
which
led
him
to
conclude
that
the
nymphs
were
following
the
chase
the
knight
filled
with
wonder
at
all
he
saw
was
conducted
by
the
saint
to
a
valley
where
he
stood
amazed
at
the
riches
strewed
all
around
him
well
he
might
be
so
for
that
valley
was
the
receptacle
of
things
lost
on
earth
either
by
men
fault
or
by
the
effect
of
time
and
chance
let
no
one
suppose
we
speak
here
of
kingdoms
or
of
treasures
they
are
the
toys
of
fortune
which
she
dispenses
in
turning
her
wheel
we
speak
of
things
which
she
can
neither
give
nor
take
away
such
are
reputations
which
appear
at
one
time
so
brilliant
and
a
short
time
after
are
heard
of
no
more
here
also
are
countless
vows
and
prayers
for
unattainable
objects
lovers
sighs
and
tears
time
spent
in
gaming
dressing
and
doing
nothing
the
leisure
of
the
dull
and
the
intentions
of
the
lazy
baseless
projects
intrigues
and
plots
these
and
such
like
things
fill
all
the
valley
astolpho
had
a
great
desire
to
understand
all
that
he
saw
and
which
appeared
to
him
so
extraordinary
among
the
rest
he
observed
a
great
mountain
of
blown
bladders
from
which
issued
indistinct
noises
the
saint
told
him
these
were
the
dynasties
of
assyrian
and
persian
kings
once
the
wonder
of
the
earth
of
which
now
scarce
the
name
remains
astolpho
could
not
help
laughing
when
the
saint
said
to
him
all
these
hooks
of
silver
and
gold
that
you
see
are
the
gifts
of
courtiers
to
princes
made
in
the
hope
of
getting
something
better
in
return
he
also
showed
him
garlands
of
flowers
in
which
snares
were
concealed
these
were
flatteries
and
adulations
meant
to
deceive
but
nothing
was
so
comical
as
the
sight
of
numerous
grasshoppers
which
had
burst
their
lungs
with
chirping
these
he
told
him
were
sonnets
odes
and
dedications
addressed
by
venal
poets
to
great
people
the
paladin
beheld
with
wonder
what
seemed
a
lake
of
spilled
milk
it
is
said
the
saint
the
charity
done
by
frightened
misers
on
their
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
all
that
the
valley
contained
meanness
affectations
pretended
virtues
and
concealed
vices
were
there
in
abundance
among
the
rest
astolpho
perceived
many
days
of
his
own
lost
and
many
imprudent
sallies
which
he
had
made
and
would
have
been
glad
not
to
have
been
reminded
of
but
he
also
saw
among
so
many
lost
things
a
great
abundance
of
one
thing
which
men
are
apt
to
think
they
all
possess
and
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
pray
for
good
sense
this
commodity
appeared
under
the
form
of
a
liquor
most
light
and
apt
to
evaporate
it
was
therefore
kept
in
vials
firmly
sealed
one
of
these
was
labelled
the
sense
of
the
paladin
orlando
all
the
bottles
were
ticketed
and
the
sage
placed
one
in
astolpho
hand
which
he
found
was
his
own
it
was
more
than
half
full
he
was
surprised
to
find
there
many
other
vials
which
contained
almost
the
whole
of
the
wits
of
many
persons
who
passed
among
men
for
wise
ah
how
easy
it
is
to
lose
one
reason
some
lose
theirs
by
yielding
to
the
sway
of
the
passions
some
in
braving
tempests
and
shoals
in
search
of
wealth
some
by
trusting
too
much
to
the
promises
of
the
great
some
by
setting
their
hearts
on
trifles
as
might
have
been
expected
the
bottles
which
held
the
wits
of
astrologers
inventors
metaphysicians
and
above
all
of
poets
were
in
general
the
best
filled
of
all
astolpho
took
his
bottle
put
it
to
his
nose
and
inhaled
it
all
and
turpin
assures
us
that
he
was
for
a
long
time
afterwards
as
sage
as
one
could
wish
but
the
archbishop
adds
that
there
was
reason
to
fear
that
some
of
the
precious
fluid
afterwards
found
its
way
back
into
the
bottle
the
paladin
took
also
the
bottle
which
belonged
to
orlando
it
was
a
large
one
and
quite
full
before
quitting
the
planetary
region
astolpho
was
conducted
to
an
edifice
on
the
borders
of
a
river
he
was
shown
an
immense
hall
full
of
bundles
of
silk
linen
cotton
and
wool
a
thousand
different
colors
brilliant
or
dull
some
quite
black
were
among
these
skeins
in
one
part
of
the
hall
an
old
woman
was
busy
winding
off
yarns
from
all
these
different
bundles
when
she
had
finished
a
skein
another
ancient
dame
took
it
and
placed
it
with
others
a
third
selected
from
the
fleeces
spun
and
mingled
them
in
due
proportions
the
paladin
inquired
what
all
this
might
be
these
old
women
said
the
saint
are
the
fates
who
spin
measure
and
terminate
the
lives
of
mortals
as
long
as
the
thread
stretches
in
one
of
those
skeins
so
long
does
the
mortal
enjoy
the
light
of
day
but
nature
and
death
are
on
the
alert
to
shut
the
eyes
of
those
whose
thread
is
spun
each
one
of
the
skeins
had
a
label
of
gold
silver
or
iron
bearing
the
name
of
the
individual
to
whom
it
belonged
an
old
man
who
in
spite
of
the
burden
of
years
seemed
brisk
and
active
ran
without
ceasing
to
fill
his
apron
with
these
labels
and
carried
them
away
to
throw
them
into
the
river
whose
name
was
lethe
when
he
reached
the
shore
of
the
river
the
old
man
shook
out
his
apron
and
the
labels
sunk
to
the
bottom
a
small
number
only
floated
for
a
time
hardly
one
in
a
thousand
numberless
birds
hawks
crows
and
vultures
hovered
over
the
stream
with
clamorous
cries
and
strove
to
snatch
from
the
water
some
of
these
names
but
they
were
too
heavy
for
them
and
after
a
while
the
birds
were
forced
to
let
them
drop
into
the
river
of
oblivion
but
two
beautiful
swans
of
snowy
whiteness
gathered
some
few
of
the
names
and
returned
with
them
to
the
shore
where
a
lovely
nymph
received
them
from
their
beaks
and
carried
them
to
a
temple
placed
upon
a
hill
and
suspended
them
for
all
time
upon
a
sacred
column
on
which
stood
the
statue
of
immortality
astolpho
was
amazed
at
all
this
and
asked
his
guide
to
explain
it
he
replied
the
old
man
is
time
all
the
names
upon
the
tickets
would
be
immortal
if
the
old
man
did
not
plunge
them
into
the
river
of
oblivion
those
clamorous
birds
which
make
vain
efforts
to
save
certain
of
the
names
are
flatterers
pensioners
venal
rhymesters
who
do
their
best
to
rescue
from
oblivion
the
unworthy
names
of
their
patrons
but
all
in
vain
they
may
keep
them
from
their
fate
a
little
while
but
ere
long
the
river
of
oblivion
must
swallow
them
all
the
swans
that
with
harmonious
strains
carry
certain
names
to
the
temple
of
eternal
memory
are
the
great
poets
who
save
from
oblivion
worse
than
death
the
names
of
those
they
judge
worthy
of
immortality
swans
of
this
kind
are
rare
let
monarchs
know
the
true
breed
and
fail
not
to
nourish
with
care
such
as
may
chance
to
appear
in
their
time
the
war
in
africa
when
astolpho
had
descended
to
the
earth
with
the
precious
phial
john
showed
him
a
plant
of
marvellous
virtues
with
which
he
told
him
he
had
only
to
touch
the
eyes
of
the
king
of
abyssinia
to
restore
him
to
sight
that
important
service
said
the
saint
added
to
your
having
delivered
him
from
the
harpies
will
induce
him
to
give
you
an
army
wherewith
to
attack
the
africans
in
their
rear
and
force
them
to
return
from
france
to
defend
their
own
country
the
saint
also
instructed
him
how
to
lead
his
troops
in
safety
across
the
great
deserts
where
caravans
are
often
overwhelmed
with
moving
columns
of
sand
astolpho
fortified
with
ample
instructions
remounted
the
hippogriff
thanked
the
saint
received
his
blessing
and
took
his
flight
down
to
the
level
country
keeping
the
course
of
the
river
nile
he
soon
arrived
at
the
capital
of
abyssinia
and
rejoined
senapus
the
joy
of
the
king
was
great
when
he
heard
again
the
voice
of
the
hero
who
had
delivered
him
from
the
harpies
astolpho
touched
his
eyes
with
the
plant
which
he
had
brought
from
the
terrestrial
paradise
and
restored
their
sight
the
king
gratitude
was
unbounded
he
begged
him
to
name
a
reward
promising
to
grant
it
whatever
it
might
be
astolpho
asked
an
army
to
go
to
the
assistance
of
charlemagne
and
the
king
not
only
granted
him
a
hundred
thousand
men
but
offered
to
lead
them
himself
the
night
before
the
day
appointed
for
the
departure
of
the
troops
astolpho
mounted
his
winged
horse
and
directed
his
flight
towards
a
mountain
whence
the
fierce
issues
whose
blast
raises
the
sands
of
the
nubian
desert
and
whirls
them
onward
in
overwhelming
clouds
the
paladin
by
the
advice
of
john
had
prepared
himself
with
a
leather
bag
which
he
placed
adroitly
with
its
mouth
open
over
the
vent
whence
issues
this
terrible
wind
at
the
first
dawn
of
morning
the
wind
rushed
from
its
cavern
to
resume
its
daily
course
and
was
caught
in
the
bag
and
securely
tied
up
astolpho
delighted
with
his
prize
returned
to
his
army
placed
himself
at
their
head
and
commenced
his
march
the
abyssinians
traversed
without
danger
or
difficulty
those
vast
fields
of
sand
which
separate
their
country
from
the
kingdoms
of
northern
africa
for
the
terrible
taken
completely
captive
had
not
force
enough
left
to
blow
out
a
candle
senapus
was
distressed
that
he
could
not
furnish
any
cavalry
for
his
country
rich
in
camels
and
elephants
was
destitute
of
horses
this
difficulty
the
saint
had
foreseen
and
had
taught
astolpho
the
means
of
remedying
he
now
put
those
means
in
operation
having
reached
a
place
whence
he
beheld
a
vast
plain
and
the
sea
he
chose
from
his
troops
those
who
appeared
to
be
the
best
made
and
the
most
intelligent
these
he
caused
to
be
arranged
in
squadrons
at
the
foot
of
a
lofty
mountain
which
bordered
the
plain
and
he
himself
mounted
to
the
summit
to
carry
into
effect
his
great
design
here
he
found
vast
quantities
of
fragments
of
rock
and
pebbles
these
he
set
rolling
down
the
mountain
side
and
wonderful
to
relate
as
they
rolled
they
grew
in
size
made
themselves
bodies
legs
necks
and
long
faces
next
they
began
to
neigh
to
curvet
to
scamper
on
all
sides
over
the
plain
some
were
bay
some
roan
some
dapple
some
chestnut
the
troops
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
exerted
themselves
to
catch
these
horses
which
they
easily
did
for
the
miracle
had
been
so
considerate
as
to
provide
all
the
horses
with
bridles
and
saddles
astolpho
thus
suddenly
found
himself
supplied
with
an
excellent
corps
of
cavalry
not
fewer
as
archbishop
turpin
asserts
than
eighty
thousand
strong
with
these
troops
astolpho
reduced
all
the
country
to
subjection
and
at
last
arrived
before
the
walls
of
agramant
capital
city
biserta
to
which
he
laid
siege
we
must
now
return
to
the
camp
of
the
christians
which
lay
before
arles
to
which
city
the
saracens
had
retired
after
being
defeated
in
a
night
attack
led
on
by
rinaldo
agramant
here
received
the
tidings
of
the
invasion
of
his
country
by
a
fresh
enemy
the
abyssinians
and
learned
that
biserta
was
in
danger
of
falling
into
their
hands
he
took
counsel
of
his
officers
and
decided
to
send
an
embassy
to
charles
proposing
that
the
whole
quarrel
should
be
submitted
to
the
combat
of
two
warriors
one
from
each
side
according
to
the
issue
of
which
it
should
be
decided
which
party
should
pay
tribute
to
the
other
and
the
war
should
cease
charlemagne
who
had
not
heard
of
the
favorable
turn
which
affairs
had
taken
in
africa
readily
agreed
to
this
proposal
and
rinaldo
was
selected
on
the
part
of
the
christians
to
sustain
the
combat
the
saracens
selected
rogero
for
their
champion
rogero
was
still
in
the
saracen
camp
kept
there
by
honor
alone
for
his
mind
had
been
opened
to
the
truth
of
the
christian
faith
by
the
arguments
of
bradamante
and
he
had
resolved
to
leave
the
party
of
the
infidels
on
the
first
favorable
opportunity
and
to
join
the
christian
side
but
his
honor
forbade
him
to
do
this
while
his
former
friends
were
in
distress
and
thus
he
waited
for
what
time
might
bring
forth
when
he
was
startled
by
the
announcement
that
he
had
been
selected
to
uphold
the
cause
of
the
saracens
against
the
christians
and
that
his
foe
was
to
be
rinaldo
the
brother
of
bradamante
while
rogero
was
overwhelmed
with
this
intelligence
bradamante
on
her
side
felt
the
deepest
distress
at
hearing
of
the
proposed
combat
if
rogero
should
fall
she
felt
that
no
other
man
living
was
worthy
of
her
love
and
if
on
the
other
hand
heaven
should
resolve
to
punish
france
by
the
death
of
her
chosen
champion
bradamante
would
have
to
deplore
her
brother
so
dear
to
her
and
be
no
less
completely
severed
from
the
object
of
her
affections
while
the
fair
lady
gave
herself
up
to
these
sad
thoughts
the
sage
enchantress
melissa
suddenly
appeared
before
her
fear
not
my
daughter
said
she
i
shall
find
a
way
to
interrupt
this
combat
which
so
distresses
you
meanwhile
rinaldo
and
rogero
prepared
their
weapons
for
the
conflict
rinaldo
had
the
choice
and
decided
that
it
should
be
on
foot
and
with
no
weapons
but
the
and
poniard
the
place
assigned
was
a
plain
between
the
camp
of
charlemagne
and
the
walls
of
arles
hardly
had
the
dawn
announced
the
day
appointed
for
this
memorable
combat
when
heralds
proceeded
from
both
sides
to
mark
the
lists
erelong
the
african
troops
were
seen
to
advance
from
the
city
agramant
at
their
head
his
brilliant
arms
adorned
in
the
moorish
fashion
his
horse
a
bay
with
a
white
star
on
his
forehead
rogero
marched
at
his
side
and
some
of
the
greatest
warriors
of
the
saracen
camp
attended
him
bearing
the
various
parts
of
his

and

charlemagne
on
his
part
proceeded
from
his
intrenchments
ranged
his
troops
in
semicircle
and
stood
surrounded
by
his
peers
and
paladins
some
of
them
bore
portions
of
the
armor
of
rinaldo
the
celebrated
ogier
the
dane
bearing
the
helmet
which
rinaldo
took
from
mambrino
duke
namo
of
bavaria
and
salomon
of
bretagne
bore
two
axes
of
equal
weight
prepared
for
the
occasion
the
terms
of
the
combat
were
then
sworn
to
with
the
utmost
solemnity
by
all
parties
it
was
agreed
that
if
from
either
part
any
attempt
was
made
to
interrupt
the
battle
both
combatants
should
turn
their
arms
against
the
party
which
should
be
guilty
of
the
interruption
and
both
monarchs
assented
to
the
condition
that
in
such
case
the
champion
of
the
offending
party
should
be
discharged
from
his
allegiance
and
at
liberty
to
transfer
his
arms
to
the
other
side
when
all
the
preparations
were
concluded
the
monarchs
and
their
attendants
retired
each
to
his
own
side
and
the
champions
were
left
alone
the
two
warriors
advanced
with
measured
steps
towards
each
other
and
met
in
the
middle
of
the
space
they
attacked
one
another
at
the
same
moment
and
the
air
resounded
with
the
blows
they
gave
sparks
flew
from
their
while
the
velocity
with
which
they
managed
their
weapons
astonished
the
beholders
rogero
always
remembering
that
his
antagonist
was
the
brother
of
his
betrothed
could
not
aim
a
deadly
wound
he
strove
only
to
ward
off
those
levelled
against
himself
rinaldo
on
the
other
hand
much
as
he
esteemed
rogero
spared
not
his
blows
for
he
eagerly
desired
victory
for
his
own
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
his
country
and
his
faith
the
saracens
soon
perceived
that
their
champion
fought
feebly
and
gave
not
to
rinaldo
such
blows
as
he
received
from
him
his
disadvantage
was
so
marked
that
anxiety
and
shame
were
manifest
on
the
countenance
of
agramant
melissa
one
of
the
most
acute
enchantresses
that
ever
lived
seized
this
moment
to
disguise
herself
under
the
form
of
rodomont
that
rude
and
impetuous
warrior
who
had
now
for
some
time
been
absent
from
the
saracen
camp
approaching
agramant
she
said
how
could
you
my
lord
have
the
imprudence
of
selecting
a
young
man
without
experience
to
oppose
the
most
redoubtable
warrior
of
france
surely
you
must
have
been
regardless
of
the
honor
of
your
arms
and
of
the
fate
of
your
empire
but
it
is
not
too
late
break
without
delay
the
agreement
which
is
sure
to
result
in
your
ruin
so
saying
she
addressed
the
troops
who
stood
near
friends
said
she
follow
me
under
my
guidance
every
one
of
you
will
be
a
match
for
a
score
of
those
feeble
christians
agramant
delighted
at
seeing
rodomont
once
more
at
his
side
gave
his
consent
and
the
saracens
at
the
instant
couched
their
lances
set
spurs
to
their
steeds
and
swept
down
upon
the
french
melissa
when
she
saw
her
work
successful
disappeared
rinaldo
and
rogero
seeing
the
truce
broken
and
the
two
armies
engaged
in
general
conflict
stopped
their
battle
their
martial
fury
ceased
at
once
they
joined
hands
and
resolved
to
act
no
more
on
either
side
until
it
should
be
clearly
ascertained
which
party
had
failed
to
observe
its
oath
both
renewed
their
promise
to
abandon
forever
the
party
which
had
been
thus
false
and
perjured
meanwhile
the
christians
after
the
first
moment
of
surprise
met
the
saracens
with
courage
redoubled
by
rage
at
the
treachery
of
their
foes
guido
the
wild
brother
and
rival
of
rinaldo
griffon
and
aquilant
sons
of
oliver
and
numerous
others
whose
names
have
already
been
celebrated
in
our
recitals
beat
back
the
assailants
and
at
last
after
prodigious
slaughter
forced
them
to
take
shelter
within
the
walls
of
arles
we
will
now
return
to
orlando
whom
we
last
heard
of
as
furiously
mad
and
doing
a
thousand
acts
of
violence
in
his
senseless
rage
one
day
he
came
to
the
borders
of
a
stream
which
intercepted
his
course
he
swam
across
it
for
he
could
swim
like
an
otter
and
on
the
other
side
saw
a
peasant
watering
his
horse
he
seized
the
animal
in
spite
of
the
resistance
of
the
peasant
and
rode
it
with
furious
speed
till
he
arrived
at
the
where
spain
is
divided
from
africa
by
only
a
narrow
strait
at
the
moment
of
his
arrival
a
vessel
had
just
put
off
to
cross
the
strait
she
was
full
of
people
who
with
glass
in
hand
seemed
to
be
taking
a
merry
farewell
of
the
land
wafted
by
a
favorable
breeze
the
frantic
orlando
cried
out
to
them
to
stop
and
take
him
in
but
they
having
no
desire
to
admit
a
madman
to
their
company
paid
him
no
attention
the
paladin
thought
this
behavior
very
uncivil
and
by
force
of
blows
made
his
horse
carry
him
into
the
water
in
pursuit
of
the
ship
the
wretched
animal
soon
had
only
his
head
above
water
but
as
orlando
urged
him
forward
nothing
was
left
for
the
poor
beast
but
either
to
die
or
swim
over
to
africa
already
orlando
had
lost
sight
of
the
bark
distance
and
the
swell
of
the
sea
completely
hid
it
from
his
sight
he
continued
to
press
his
horse
forward
till
at
last
it
could
struggle
no
more
and
sunk
beneath
him
orlando
nowise
concerned
stretched
out
his
nervous
arms
puffing
the
salt
water
from
before
his
mouth
and
carried
his
head
above
the
waves
fortunately
they
were
not
rough
scarce
a
breath
of
wind
agitated
the
surface
otherwise
the
invincible
orlando
would
then
have
met
his
death
but
fortune
which
it
is
said
favors
fools
delivered
him
from
this
danger
and
landed
him
safe
on
the
shore
of
ceuta
here
he
rambled
along
the
shore
till
he
came
to
where
the
black
army
of
astolpho
held
its
camp
now
it
happened
just
before
this
time
that
a
vessel
filled
with
prisoners
which
rodomont
had
taken
at
the
bridge
had
arrived
and
not
knowing
of
the
presence
of
the
abyssinian
army
had
sailed
right
into
port
where
of
course
the
prisoners
and
their
captors
changed
places
the
former
being
set
at
liberty
and
received
with
all
joy
the
latter
sent
to
serve
in
the
galleys
astolpho
thus
found
himself
surrounded
with
christian
knights
and
he
and
his
friends
were
exchanging
greetings
and
felicitations
when
a
noise
was
heard
in
the
camp
and
seemed
to
increase
every
moment
astolpho
and
his
friends
seized
their
weapons
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
to
the
quarter
whence
the
noise
proceeded
imagine
their
astonishment
when
they
saw
that
the
tumult
was
caused
by
a
single
man
perfectly
naked
and
browned
with
dirt
and
exposure
but
of
a
force
and
fury
so
terrible
that
he
overturned
all
that
offered
to
lay
hands
on
him
astolpho
dudon
oliver
and
florimart
gazed
at
him
with
amazement
it
was
with
difficulty
they
knew
him
astolpho
who
had
been
warned
of
his
condition
by
his
holy
monitor
was
the
first
to
recognize
him
as
the
paladins
closed
round
orlando
the
madman
dealt
one
and
another
a
blow
of
his
fist
which
if
they
had
not
been
in
armor
or
he
had
had
any
weapon
would
probably
have
despatched
them
as
it
was
dudon
and
astolpho
measured
their
length
on
the
sand
but
florimart
seized
him
from
behind
sansonnet
and
another
grasped
his
legs
and
at
last
they
succeeded
in
securing
him
with
ropes
they
took
him
to
the
and
washed
him
well
and
then
astolpho
having
first
bandaged
his
mouth
so
that
he
could
not
breathe
except
through
his
nose
brought
the
precious
phial
uncorked
it
and
placed
it
adroitly
under
his
nostrils
when
the
good
orlando
took
it
all
up
in
one
breath
o
marvellous
prodigy
the
paladin
recovered
in
an
instant
all
his
intelligence
he
felt
like
one
who
had
awakened
from
a
painful
dream
in
which
he
had
believed
that
monsters
were
about
to
tear
him
to
pieces
he
seemed
prostrated
silent
and
abashed
florismart
oliver
and
astolpho
stood
gazing
upon
him
while
he
turned
his
eyes
around
and
on
himself
he
seemed
surprised
to
find
himself
naked
bound
and
stretched
on
the
after
a
few
moments
he
recognized
his
friends
and
spoke
to
them
in
a
tone
so
tender
that
they
hastened
to
unbind
him
and
to
supply
him
with
garments
then
they
exerted
themselves
to
console
him
to
diminish
the
weight
with
which
his
spirits
were
oppressed
and
to
make
him
forget
the
wretched
condition
into
which
he
had
been
sunk
orlando
in
recovering
his
reason
found
himself
also
delivered
from
his
insane
attachment
to
the
queen
of
cathay
his
heart
felt
now
no
further
influenced
by
the
recollection
of
her
than
to
be
moved
with
an
ardent
desire
to
retrieve
his
fame
by
some
distinguished
exploit
astolpho
would
gladly
have
yielded
to
him
the
chief
command
of
the
army
but
orlando
would
not
take
from
the
friend
to
whom
he
owed
so
much
the
glory
of
the
campaign
but
in
everything
the
two
paladins
acted
in
concert
and
united
their
counsels
they
proposed
to
make
a
general
assault
on
the
city
of
biserta
and
were
only
waiting
a
favorable
moment
when
their
plan
was
interrupted
by
new
events
agramant
after
the
bloody
battle
which
followed
the
infraction
of
the
truce
found
himself
so
weak
that
he
saw
it
was
in
vain
to
attempt
to
remain
in
france
so
in
concert
with
sobrino
the
bravest
and
most
trusted
of
his
chiefs
he
embarked
to
return
to
his
own
country
having
previously
sent
off
his
few
remaining
troops
in
the
same
direction
the
vessel
which
carried
agramant
and
sobrino
approached
the
shore
where
the
army
of
astolpho
lay
encamped
before
biserta
and
having
discovered
this
fact
before
it
was
too
late
the
king
commanded
the
pilot
to
steer
eastward
with
a
view
to
seek
protection
of
the
king
of
egypt
but
the
weather
becoming
rough
he
consented
to
the
advice
of
his
companions
and
sought
harbor
in
an
island
which
lies
between
sicily
and
africa
there
he
found
gradasso
the
warlike
king
of
sericane
who
had
come
to
france
to
possess
himself
of
the
horse
bayard
and
the
sword
durindana
and
having
procured
both
these
prizes
was
returning
to
his
own
country
the
two
kings
who
had
been
companions
in
arms
under
the
walls
of
paris
embraced
one
another
affectionately
gradasso
learned
with
regret
the
reverses
of
agramant
and
offered
him
his
troops
and
his
person
he
strongly
deprecated
resorting
to
egypt
for
aid
remember
the
great
pompey
said
he
and
shun
that
fatal
shore
my
plan
he
continued
is
this
i
mean
to
challenge
orlando
to
single
combat
possessed
of
such
a
sword
and
steed
as
mine
if
he
were
made
of
steel
or
bronze
he
could
not
escape
me
he
being
removed
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
driving
back
the
abyssinians
we
will
rouse
against
them
the
moslem
nations
from
the
other
side
of
the
nile
the
arabians
persians
and
chaldeans
who
will
soon
make
senapus
recall
his
army
to
defend
his
own
territories
agramant
approved
this
advice
except
in
one
particular
it
is
for
me
said
he
to
combat
orlando
i
can
not
with
honor
devolve
that
duty
on
another
let
us
adopt
a
third
course
said
the
aged
warrior
sobrino
i
would
not
willingly
remain
a
simple
spectator
of
such
a
contest
let
us
send
three
squires
to
the
shore
of
africa
to
challenge
orlando
and
any
two
of
his
companions
in
arms
to
meet
us
three
in
this
island
of
lampedusa
this
counsel
was
adopted
the
three
squires
sped
on
their
way
and
now
presented
themselves
and
rehearsed
their
message
to
the
christian
knights
orlando
was
delighted
and
rewarded
the
squires
with
rich
gifts
he
had
already
resolved
to
seek
gradasso
and
compel
him
to
restore
durindana
which
he
had
learned
was
in
his
possession
for
his
two
companions
the
count
chose
his
faithful
friend
florismart
and
his
cousin
oliver
the
three
warriors
embarked
and
sailing
with
a
favorable
wind
the
second
morning
showed
them
on
their
right
the
island
where
this
important
battle
was
to
be
fought
orlando
and
his
two
companions
having
landed
pitched
their
tent
agramant
had
placed
his
opposite
next
morning
as
soon
as
aurora
brightened
the
edges
of
the
horizon
the
warriors
of
both
parties
armed
themselves
and
mounted
their
horses
they
took
their
positions
face
to
face
lowered
their
lances
placed
them
in
rest
clapped
spurs
to
their
horses
and
flew
to
the
charge
orlando
met
the
charge
of
gradasso
the
paladin
was
unmoved
but
his
horse
could
not
sustain
the
terrible
shock
of
bayard
he
recoiled
staggered
and
fell
some
paces
behind
orlando
tried
to
raise
him
but
finding
his
efforts
unavailing
seized
his
shield
and
drew
his
famous
balisardo
meanwhile
agramant
and
the
brave
oliver
gained
no
advantage
one
or
the
other
but
florismart
unhorsed
the
king
sobrino
having
brought
his
foe
to
the
ground
he
would
not
pursue
his
victory
but
hastened
to
attack
gradasso
who
had
overthrown
orlando
seeing
him
thus
engaged
orlando
would
not
interfere
but
ran
with
sword
upraised
upon
sobrino
and
with
one
blow
deprived
him
of
sense
and
motion
believing
him
dead
he
next
turned
to
aid
his
beloved
florismart
that
brave
paladin
neither
in
horse
nor
arms
equal
to
his
antagonist
could
but
parry
and
evade
the
blows
of
the
terrible
durindana
orlando
eager
to
succor
him
was
delayed
for
a
moment
in
securing
and
mounting
the
horse
of
the
king
sobrino
it
was
but
an
instant
and
with
sword
upraised
he
rushed
upon
gradasso
who
noways
disconcerted
at
the
onset
of
this
second
foe
shouted
his
defiance
and
thrust
at
him
with
his
sword
but
having
miscalculated
the
distance
scarcely
reached
him
and
failed
to
pierce
his
mail
orlando
in
return
dealt
him
a
blow
with
balisardo
which
wounded
as
it
fell
face
breast
and
thigh
and
if
he
had
been
a
little
nearer
would
have
cleft
him
in
twain
sobrino
by
this
time
recovered
from
his
swoon
though
severely
wounded
raised
himself
on
his
legs
and
looked
to
see
how
he
might
aid
his
friends
observing
agramant
hard
pressed
by
oliver
he
thrust
his
sword
into
the
bowels
of
the
latter
horse
which
fell
and
bore
down
his
master
entangling
his
leg
as
he
fell
so
that
oliver
could
not
extricate
himself
florismart
saw
the
danger
of
his
friend
and
ran
upon
sobrino
with
his
horse
overthrew
him
and
then
turned
to
defend
himself
from
agramant
they
were
not
unequally
matched
for
though
agramant
mounted
on
brigliadoro
had
an
advantage
over
florismart
whose
horse
was
but
indifferent
yet
agramant
had
received
a
serious
wound
in
his
encounter
with
oliver
nothing
could
exceed
the
fury
of
the
encounter
between
orlando
and
gradasso
durindana
in
the
hands
of
gradasso
clove
asunder
whatever
it
struck
but
such
was
the
skill
of
orlando
who
perfectly
knew
the
danger
to
which
he
was
exposed
from
a
stroke
of
that
weapon
it
had
not
yet
struck
him
in
such
a
way
as
to
inflict
a
wound
meanwhile
gradasso
was
bleeding
from
many
wounds
and
his
rage
and
incaution
increased
every
moment
in
his
desperation
he
lifted
durindana
with
both
hands
and
struck
so
terrible
a
blow
full
on
the
helmet
of
orlando
that
for
a
moment
it
stunned
the
paladin
he
dropped
the
reins
and
his
frightened
horse
scoured
with
him
over
the
plain
gradasso
turned
to
pursue
him
but
at
that
moment
saw
florismart
in
the
very
act
of
striking
a
fatal
blow
at
agramant
whom
he
had
unhorsed
while
florismart
was
wholly
intent
upon
completing
his
victory
gradasso
plunged
his
sword
into
his
side
florismart
fell
from
his
horse
and
bathed
the
plain
with
his
blood
orlando
recovered
himself
just
in
time
to
see
the
deed
whether
rage
or
grief
predominated
in
his
breast
i
can
not
tell
but
seizing
balisardo
with
fury
his
first
blow
fell
upon
agramant
who
was
nearest
to
him
and
smote
his
head
from
his
shoulders
at
this
sight
gradasso
for
the
first
time
felt
his
courage
sink
and
a
dark
presentiment
of
death
came
over
him
he
hardly
stood
on
his
defence
when
orlando
cast
himself
upon
him
and
gave
him
a
fatal
thrust
the
sword
penetrated
his
ribs
and
came
out
a
breadth
on
the
other
side
of
his
body
thus
fell
beneath
the
sword
of
the
most
illustrious
paladin
of
france
the
bravest
warrior
of
the
saracen
host
orlando
then
as
if
despising
his
victory
leaped
lightly
to
the
ground
and
ran
to
his
dear
friend
florismart
embraced
him
and
bathed
him
with
his
tears
florismart
still
breathed
he
could
even
command
his
voice
to
utter
a
few
parting
words
dear
friend
do
not
forget
me
give
me
your
prayers
and
oh
be
a
brother
to
flordelis
he
died
in
uttering
her
name
after
a
few
moments
given
to
grief
orlando
turned
to
look
for
his
other
companion
and
his
late
foes
oliver
lay
oppressed
with
the
weight
of
his
horse
from
which
he
had
in
vain
struggled
to
liberate
himself
orlando
extricated
him
with
difficulty
he
then
raised
sobrino
from
the
earth
and
committed
him
to
his
squire
treating
him
as
gently
as
if
he
had
been
his
own
brother
for
this
terrible
warrior
was
the
most
generous
of
men
to
a
fallen
foe
he
took
bayard
and
brigliadoro
with
the
arms
of
the
conquered
knights
their
bodies
and
their
other
spoils
he
remitted
to
their
attendants
but
who
can
tell
the
grief
of
flordelis
when
she
saw
the
warriors
return
and
found
not
florismart
as
usual
after
absence
hasten
to
her
side
she
knew
by
the
aspect
of
the
others
that
her
lord
was
slain
at
the
thought
and
before
the
question
could
pass
her
lips
she
fell
senseless
upon
the
ground
when
life
returned
and
she
learned
the
truth
of
her
worst
fears
she
bitterly
upbraided
herself
that
she
had
let
him
depart
without
her
i
might
have
saved
him
by
a
single
cry
when
his
enemy
dealt
him
that
treacherous
blow
or
i
might
have
thrown
myself
between
and
given
my
worthless
life
for
his
or
if
no
more
i
might
have
heard
his
last
words
i
might
have
given
him
a
last
kiss
so
she
lamented
and
could
not
be
comforted
rogero
and
bradamante
after
the
interruption
of
the
combat
with
rinaldo
as
we
have
related
rogero
was
perplexed
with
doubts
what
course
to
take
the
terms
of
the
treaty
required
him
to
abandon
agramant
who
had
broken
it
and
to
transfer
his
allegiance
to
charlemagne
and
his
love
for
bradamante
called
him
in
the
same
direction
but
unwillingness
to
desert
his
prince
and
leader
in
the
hour
of
distress
forbade
this
course
embarking
therefore
for
africa
he
took
his
way
to
rejoin
the
saracen
army
but
was
arrested
midway
by
a
storm
which
drove
the
vessel
on
a
rock
the
crew
took
to
their
boat
but
that
was
quickly
swamped
in
the
waves
and
rogero
with
the
rest
were
compelled
to
swim
for
their
lives
then
while
buffeting
the
waves
rogero
bethought
him
of
his
sin
in
so
long
delaying
his
christian
profession
and
vowed
in
his
heart
that
if
he
should
live
to
reach
the
land
he
would
no
longer
delay
to
be
baptized
his
vows
were
heard
and
answered
he
succeeded
in
reaching
the
shore
and
was
aided
and
relieved
on
landing
by
a
pious
hermit
whose
cell
overlooked
the
sea
from
him
he
received
baptism
having
first
passed
some
days
with
him
partaking
his
humble
fare
and
receiving
instruction
in
the
doctrines
of
the
christian
faith
while
these
things
were
going
on
rinaldo
who
had
set
out
on
his
way
to
seek
gradasso
and
recover
bayard
from
him
hearing
on
his
way
of
the
great
things
which
were
doing
in
africa
repaired
thither
to
bear
his
part
in
them
he
arrived
too
late
to
do
more
than
join
his
friends
in
lamenting
the
loss
of
florismart
and
to
rejoice
with
them
in
their
victory
over
the
pagan
knights
on
the
death
of
their
king
the
africans
gave
up
the
contest
biserta
submitted
and
the
christian
knights
had
only
to
dismiss
their
forces
and
return
home
astolpho
took
leave
of
his
abyssinian
army
and
sent
them
back
laden
with
spoil
to
their
own
country
not
forgetting
to
intrust
to
them
the
bag
which
held
the
winds
by
means
of
which
they
were
enabled
to
cross
the
sandy
desert
again
without
danger
and
did
not
untie
it
till
they
reached
their
own
country
orlando
now
with
oliver
who
much
needed
the
surgeon
care
and
sobrino
to
whom
equal
attention
was
shown
sailed
in
a
swift
vessel
to
sicily
bearing
with
him
the
body
of
florismart
to
be
laid
in
christian
earth
rinaldo
accompanied
them
as
did
sansonnet
and
the
other
christian
leaders
arrived
at
sicily
the
funeral
was
solemnized
with
all
the
rites
of
religion
and
with
the
profound
grief
of
those
who
had
known
florismart
or
had
heard
of
his
fame
then
they
resumed
their
course
steering
for
marseilles
but
oliver
wound
grew
worse
instead
of
better
and
his
sufferings
so
distressed
his
friends
that
they
conferred
together
not
knowing
what
to
do
then
said
the
pilot
we
are
not
far
from
an
isle
where
a
holy
hermit
dwells
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
it
is
said
none
seek
his
counsel
or
his
aid
in
vain
he
hath
wrought
marvellous
cures
and
if
you
resort
to
that
holy
man
without
doubt
he
can
heal
the
knight
orlando
bade
him
steer
thither
and
soon
the
bark
was
laid
safely
beside
the
lonely
rock
the
wounded
man
was
lowered
into
their
boat
and
carried
by
the
crew
to
the
hermit
cell
it
was
the
same
hermit
with
whom
rogero
had
taken
refuge
after
his
shipwreck
by
whom
he
had
been
baptized
and
with
whom
he
was
now
staying
absorbed
in
sacred
studies
and
meditations
the
holy
man
received
orlando
and
the
rest
with
kindness
and
inquired
their
errand
and
being
told
that
they
had
come
for
help
for
one
who
warring
for
the
christian
faith
was
brought
to
perilous
pass
by
a
sad
wound
he
straightway
undertook
the
cure
his
applications
were
simple
but
they
were
seconded
by
his
prayers
the
paladin
was
soon
relieved
from
pain
and
in
a
few
days
his
foot
was
perfectly
restored
to
soundness
sobrino
as
soon
as
he
perceived
the
holy
monk
perform
that
wonder
cast
aside
his
false
prophet
and
with
contrite
heart
owned
the
true
god
and
demanded
baptism
at
his
hands
the
hermit
granted
his
request
and
also
by
his
prayers
restored
him
to
health
while
all
the
christian
knights
rejoiced
in
his
conversion
almost
as
much
as
at
the
restoration
of
oliver
more
than
all
rogero
felt
joy
and
gratitude
and
daily
grew
in
grace
and
faith
rogero
was
known
by
fame
to
all
the
christian
knights
but
not
even
rinaldo
knew
him
by
sight
though
he
had
proved
his
prowess
in
combat
sobrino
made
him
known
to
them
and
great
was
the
joy
of
all
when
they
found
one
whose
valor
and
courtesy
were
renowned
through
the
world
no
longer
an
enemy
and
unbeliever
but
a
convert
and
champion
of
the
true
faith
all
press
about
the
knight
one
grasps
his
hand
another
locks
him
fast
in
his
embrace
but
more
than
all
the
rest
rinaldo
cherished
him
for
he
more
than
any
knew
his
worth
it
was
not
long
before
rogero
confided
to
his
friend
the
hopes
he
entertained
of
a
union
with
his
sister
and
rinaldo
frankly
gave
his
sanction
to
the
proposal
but
causes
unknown
to
the
paladin
were
at
that
very
time
interposing
obstacles
to
its
success
the
fame
of
the
beauty
and
worth
of
bradamante
had
reached
the
ears
of
the
grecian
emperor
constantine
and
he
had
sent
to
charlemagne
to
demand
the
hand
of
his
niece
for
leo
his
son
and
the
heir
to
his
dominions
duke
aymon
her
father
had
only
reserved
his
consent
until
he
should
first
have
spoken
with
his
son
rinaldo
now
absent
the
warriors
now
prepared
to
resume
their
voyage
rogero
took
a
tender
farewell
of
the
good
hermit
who
had
taught
him
the
true
faith
orlando
restored
to
him
the
horse
and
arms
which
were
rightly
his
not
even
asserting
his
claim
to
balisarda
that
sword
which
he
himself
had
won
from
the
enchantress
the
hermit
gave
his
blessing
to
the
band
and
they
reembarked
the
passage
was
speedy
and
very
soon
they
arrived
in
the
harbor
of
marseilles
astolpho
when
he
had
dismissed
his
troops
mounted
the
hippogriff
and
at
one
flight
shot
over
to
sardinia
thence
to
corsica
thence
turning
slightly
to
the
left
hovered
over
provence
and
alighted
in
the
neighborhood
of
marseilles
there
he
did
what
he
had
been
commanded
to
do
by
the
holy
saint
he
unbridled
the
hippogriff
and
turned
him
loose
to
seek
his
own
retreats
never
more
to
be
galled
with
saddle
or
bit
the
horn
had
lost
its
marvellous
power
ever
since
the
visit
to
the
moon
astolpho
reached
marseilles
the
very
day
when
orlando
rinaldo
oliver
sobrino
and
rogero
arrived
there
charles
had
already
heard
the
news
of
the
defeat
of
the
saracen
kings
and
all
the
accompanying
events
on
learning
the
approach
of
the
gallant
knights
he
sent
forward
some
of
his
most
illustrious
nobles
to
receive
them
and
himself
with
the
rest
of
his
court
kings
dukes
and
peers
the
queen
and
a
fair
and
gorgeous
band
of
ladies
set
forward
from
arles
to
meet
them
no
sooner
were
the
mutual
greetings
interchanged
than
orlando
and
his
friends
led
forward
rogero
and
presented
him
to
the
emperor
they
vouch
him
son
of
rogero
duke
of
risa
one
of
the
most
renowned
of
christian
warriors
by
adverse
fortune
stolen
in
his
infancy
and
brought
up
by
saracens
in
the
false
faith
now
by
a
kind
providence
converted
and
restored
to
fill
the
place
his
father
once
held
among
the
foremost
champions
of
the
throne
and
church
rogero
had
alighted
from
his
horse
and
stood
respectfully
before
the
emperor
charlemagne
bade
him
remount
and
ride
beside
him
and
omitted
nothing
which
might
do
him
honor
in
sight
of
his
martial
train
with
pomp
triumphal
and
with
festive
cheer
the
troop
returned
to
the
city
the
streets
were
decorated
with
garlands
the
houses
hung
with
rich
tapestry
and
flowers
fell
like
rain
upon
the
conquering
host
from
the
hands
of
fair
dames
and
damsels
from
every
balcony
and
window
so
welcomed
the
mighty
emperor
passed
on
till
he
reached
the
royal
palace
where
many
days
he
feasted
high
in
hall
with
his
lords
amid
tourney
revel
dance
and
song
when
rinaldo
told
his
father
duke
aymon
how
he
had
promised
his
sister
to
rogero
his
father
heard
him
with
indignation
having
set
his
heart
on
seeing
her
united
to
the
grecian
emperor
son
the
lady
beatrice
her
mother
also
appealed
to
bradamante
herself
to
reject
a
knight
who
had
neither
title
nor
lands
and
give
the
preference
to
one
who
would
make
her
empress
of
the
wide
levant
but
bradamante
though
respect
forbade
her
to
refuse
her
entreaty
would
not
promise
to
do
what
her
heart
repelled
and
answered
only
with
a
sigh
until
she
was
alone
and
then
gave
a
loose
to
tears
meanwhile
rogero
indignant
that
a
stranger
should
presume
to
rob
him
of
his
bride
determined
to
seek
the
prince
of
greece
and
defy
him
to
mortal
combat
with
this
design
he
donned
his
armor
but
exchanged
his
crest
and
emblazonment
and
bore
instead
a
white
unicorn
upon
a
crimson
field
he
chose
a
trusty
squire
and
commanding
him
not
to
address
him
as
rogero
rode
on
his
quest
having
crossed
the
rhine
and
the
austrian
countries
into
hungary
he
followed
the
course
of
the
danube
till
he
reached
belgrade
there
he
saw
the
imperial
ensigns
spread
and
white
pavilions
thronged
with
troops
before
the
town
for
the
emperor
constantine
was
laying
siege
to
the
city
to
recover
it
from
the
bulgarians
who
had
taken
it
from
him
not
long
before
a
river
flowed
between
the
camp
of
the
emperor
and
the
bulgarians
and
at
the
moment
when
rogero
approached
a
skirmish
had
begun
between
the
parties
from
either
camp
who
had
approached
the
stream
for
the
purpose
of
watering
the
greeks
in
that
affray
were
four
to
one
and
drove
back
the
bulgarians
in
precipitate
rout
rogero
seeing
this
and
animated
only
by
his
hatred
of
the
grecian
prince
dashed
into
the
middle
of
the
flying
mass
calling
aloud
on
the
fugitives
to
turn
he
encountered
first
a
leader
of
the
grecian
host
in
splendid
armor
a
nephew
of
the
emperor
as
dear
to
him
as
a
son
rogero
lance
pierced
shield
and
armor
and
stretched
the
warrior
breathless
on
the
plain
another
and
another
fell
before
him
and
astonishment
and
terror
arrested
the
advance
of
the
greeks
while
the
bulgarians
catching
courage
from
the
cavalier
rally
change
front
and
chase
the
grecian
troops
who
fly
in
their
turn
leo
the
prince
was
at
a
distance
when
this
sudden
skirmish
rose
but
not
so
far
but
that
he
could
see
distinctly
from
an
elevated
position
which
he
held
how
the
changed
battle
was
all
the
work
of
one
man
and
could
not
choose
but
admire
the
bravery
and
prowess
with
which
it
was
done
he
knew
by
the
blazonry
displayed
that
the
champion
was
not
of
the
bulgarian
army
though
he
furnished
aid
to
them
although
he
suffered
by
his
valor
the
prince
could
not
wish
him
ill
for
his
admiration
surpassed
his
resentment
by
this
time
the
greeks
had
regained
the
river
and
crossing
it
by
fording
or
swimming
some
made
their
escape
leaving
many
more
prisoners
in
the
hands
of
the
bulgarians
rogero
learning
from
some
of
the
captives
that
leo
was
at
a
point
some
distance
down
the
river
rode
thither
with
a
view
to
meet
him
but
arrived
not
before
the
greek
prince
had
retired
beyond
the
stream
and
broken
up
the
bridge
day
was
spent
and
rogero
wearied
looked
round
for
a
shelter
for
the
night
he
found
it
in
a
cottage
where
he
soon
yielded
himself
to
repose
it
so
happened
a
knight
who
had
narrowly
escaped
sword
in
the
late
battle
also
found
shelter
in
the
same
cottage
and
recognizing
the
armor
of
the
unknown
knight
easily
found
means
of
securing
him
as
he
slept
and
next
morning
carried
him
in
chains
and
delivered
him
to
the
emperor
by
him
he
was
in
turn
delivered
to
his
sister
theodora
mother
of
the
young
knight
the
first
victim
of
rogero
spear
by
her
he
was
cast
into
a
dungeon
till
her
ingenuity
could
devise
a
death
sufficiently
painful
to
satiate
her
revenge
bradamante
meanwhile
to
escape
her
father
and
importunity
had
begged
a
boon
of
charlemagne
which
the
monarch
pledged
his
royal
word
to
grant
it
was
that
she
should
not
be
compelled
to
marry
any
one
unless
he
should
first
vanquish
her
in
single
combat
the
emperor
therefore
proclaimed
a
tournament
in
these
words
he
that
would
wed
duke
aymon
daughter
must
contend
with
the
sword
against
that
dame
from
the
sun
rise
to
his
setting
and
if
in
that
time
he
is
not
overcome
the
lady
shall
be
his
duke
aymon
and
the
lady
beatrice
though
much
incensed
at
the
course
things
had
taken
brought
their
daughter
to
court
to
await
the
day
appointed
for
the
tournament
bradamante
not
finding
there
him
whom
her
heart
required
distressed
herself
with
doubts
what
could
be
the
cause
of
his
absence
of
all
fancies
the
most
painful
one
was
that
he
had
gone
away
to
learn
to
forget
her
knowing
her
father
and
her
mother
opposition
to
their
union
and
despairing
to
contend
against
them
but
oh
how
much
worse
would
be
the
maiden
woe
if
it
were
known
to
her
what
her
betrothed
was
then
enduring
he
was
plunged
in
a
dungeon
where
no
ray
of
daylight
ever
penetrated
loaded
with
chains
and
scantily
supplied
with
the
coarsest
food
no
wonder
despair
took
possession
of
his
heart
and
he
longed
for
death
as
a
relief
when
one
night
or
one
day
for
both
were
equally
dark
to
him
he
was
roused
with
the
glare
of
a
torch
and
saw
two
men
enter
his
cell
it
was
the
prince
leo
with
an
attendant
who
had
come
as
soon
as
he
had
learned
the
wretched
fate
of
the
brave
knight
whose
valor
he
had
seen
and
admired
on
the
field
of
battle
cavalier
said
he
i
am
one
whom
thy
valor
hath
so
bound
to
thee
that
i
willingly
peril
my
own
safety
to
lend
thee
aid
infinite
thanks
i
owe
you
replied
rogero
and
the
life
you
give
me
i
promise
faithfully
to
render
back
upon
your
call
and
promptly
to
stake
it
at
all
times
for
your
service
the
prince
then
told
rogero
his
name
and
rank
at
hearing
which
a
tide
of
contending
emotions
almost
overwhelmed
rogero
he
was
set
at
liberty
and
had
his
horse
and
arms
restored
to
him
meanwhile
tidings
arrived
of
king
charles
decree
that
whoever
aspired
to
the
hand
of
bradamante
must
first
encounter
her
with
sword
and
lance
this
news
made
the
grecian
prince
turn
pale
for
he
knew
he
was
no
match
for
her
in
fight
communing
with
himself
he
sees
how
he
may
make
his
wit
supply
the
place
of
valor
and
employ
the
french
knight
whose
name
was
still
unknown
to
him
to
fight
the
battle
for
him
rogero
heard
the
proposal
with
extreme
distress
yet
it
seemed
worse
than
death
to
deny
the
first
request
of
one
to
whom
he
owed
his
life
hastily
he
gave
his
assent
to
do
in
all
things
that
which
leo
should
command
afterward
bitter
repentance
came
over
him
yet
rather
than
confess
his
change
of
mind
death
itself
would
be
welcome
death
seems
his
only
remedy
but
how
to
die
sometimes
he
thinks
to
make
none
but
a
feigned
resistance
and
allow
her
sword
a
ready
access
for
never
can
death
come
more
happily
than
if
her
hand
guide
the
weapon
yet
this
will
not
avail
for
unless
he
wins
the
maid
for
the
greek
prince
his
debt
remains
unpaid
he
had
promised
to
maintain
a
real
not
a
feigned
encounter
he
will
then
keep
his
word
and
banish
every
thought
from
his
bosom
except
that
which
moved
him
to
maintain
his
truth
the
young
prince
richly
attended
set
out
and
with
him
rogero
they
arrived
at
paris
but
leo
preferred
not
to
enter
the
city
and
pitched
his
tents
without
the
walls
making
known
his
arrival
to
charlemagne
by
an
embassy
the
monarch
was
pleased
and
testified
his
courtesy
by
visits
and
gifts
the
prince
set
forth
the
purpose
of
his
coming
and
prayed
the
emperor
to
dispatch
his
suit
to
send
forth
the
damsel
who
refused
ever
to
take
in
wedlock
any
lord
inferior
to
herself
in
fight
for
she
should
be
his
bride
or
he
would
perish
beneath
her
sword
rogero
passed
the
night
before
the
day
assigned
for
the
battle
like
that
which
the
felon
spends
condemned
to
pay
the
forfeit
of
his
life
on
the
ensuing
day
he
chose
to
fight
with
sword
only
and
on
foot
for
he
would
not
let
her
see
frontino
knowing
that
she
would
recognize
the
steed
nor
would
he
use
balisarda
for
against
that
enchanted
blade
all
armor
would
be
of
no
avail
and
the
sword
that
he
did
take
he
hammered
well
upon
the
edge
to
abate
its
sharpness
he
wore
the
surcoat
of
prince
leo
and
his
shield
emblazoned
with
a
golden
eagle
the
prince
took
care
to
let
himself
be
seen
by
none
bradamante
meanwhile
prepared
herself
for
the
combat
far
differently
instead
of
blunting
the
edge
of
her
falchion
she
whets
the
steel
and
would
fain
infuse
into
it
her
own
acerbity
as
the
moment
approached
she
seemed
to
have
fire
within
her
veins
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
trumpet
sound
at
the
signal
she
drew
her
sword
and
fell
with
fury
upon
her
rogero
but
as
a
built
wall
or
aged
rock
stands
unmoved
the
fury
of
the
storm
so
rogero
clad
in
those
arms
which
trojan
hector
once
wore
withstood
the
strokes
which
stormed
about
his
head
and
breast
and
flank
sparks
flew
from
his
shield
his
helm
his
cuirass
from
direct
and
back
strokes
aimed
now
high
now
low
falling
thick
and
fast
like
hailstones
on
a
cottage
roof
but
rogero
with
skilful
ward
turns
them
aside
or
receives
them
where
his
armor
is
a
sure
protection
careful
only
to
protect
himself
and
with
no
thought
of
striking
in
return
thus
the
hours
passed
away
and
as
the
sun
approached
the
west
the
damsel
began
to
despair
but
so
much
the
more
her
anger
increases
and
she
redoubles
her
efforts
like
the
craftsman
who
sees
his
work
unfinished
while
the
day
is
wellnigh
spent
o
miserable
damsel
didst
thou
know
whom
thou
wouldst
kill
if
in
that
cavalier
matched
against
thee
thou
didst
but
know
rogero
on
whom
thy
very
hang
rather
than
kill
him
thou
wouldst
kill
thyself
for
he
is
dearer
to
thee
than
life
king
charles
and
the
peers
who
thought
the
cavalier
to
be
the
grecian
prince
viewing
such
force
and
skill
exhibited
and
how
without
assaulting
her
the
knight
defended
himself
were
filled
with
admiration
and
declared
the
champions
well
matched
and
worthy
of
each
other
when
the
sun
was
set
charlemagne
gave
the
signal
for
terminating
the
contest
and
bradamante
was
awarded
to
prince
leo
as
a
bride
rogero
in
deep
distress
returned
to
his
tent
there
leo
unlaced
his
helmet
and
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
henceforth
said
he
do
with
me
as
you
please
for
you
can
not
exhaust
my
gratitude
rogero
replied
little
laid
aside
the
ensigns
he
had
worn
and
resumed
the
unicorn
then
hasted
to
withdraw
himself
from
all
eyes
when
it
was
midnight
he
rose
saddled
frontino
and
sallied
from
his
tent
taking
that
direction
which
pleased
his
steed
all
night
he
rode
absorbed
in
bitter
woe
and
called
on
death
as
alone
capable
of
relieving
his
sufferings
at
last
he
entered
a
forest
and
penetrated
into
its
deepest
recesses
there
he
unharnessed
frontino
and
suffered
him
to
wander
where
he
would
then
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
ground
and
poured
forth
such
bitter
wailings
that
the
birds
and
beasts
for
none
else
heard
him
were
moved
to
pity
with
his
cries
not
less
was
the
distress
of
the
lady
bradamante
who
rather
than
wed
any
one
but
rogero
resolved
to
break
her
word
and
defy
kindred
court
and
charlemagne
himself
and
if
nothing
else
would
do
to
die
but
relief
came
from
an
unexpected
quarter
marphisa
sister
of
rogero
was
a
heroine
of
warlike
prowess
equal
to
bradamante
she
had
been
the
confidante
of
their
loves
and
felt
hardly
less
distress
than
themselves
at
seeing
the
perils
which
threatened
their
union
they
are
already
united
by
mutual
vows
she
said
and
in
the
sight
of
heaven
what
more
is
necessary
full
of
this
thought
she
presented
herself
before
charlemagne
and
declared
that
she
herself
was
witness
that
the
maiden
had
spoken
to
rogero
those
words
which
they
who
marry
swear
and
that
the
compact
was
so
sealed
between
the
pair
that
they
were
no
longer
free
nor
could
forsake
the
one
the
other
to
take
another
spouse
this
her
assertion
she
offered
to
prove
in
single
combat
against
prince
leo
or
any
one
else
charlemagne
sadly
perplexed
at
this
commanded
bradamante
to
be
called
and
told
her
what
the
bold
marphisa
had
declared
bradamante
neither
denied
nor
confirmed
the
statement
but
hung
her
head
and
kept
silence
duke
aymon
was
enraged
and
would
fain
have
set
aside
the
pretended
contract
on
the
ground
that
if
made
at
all
it
must
have
been
made
before
rogero
was
baptized
and
therefore
void
but
not
so
thought
rinaldo
nor
the
good
orlando
and
charlemagne
knew
not
which
way
to
decide
when
marphisa
spoke
thus
since
no
one
else
can
marry
the
maiden
while
my
brother
lives
let
the
prince
meet
rogero
in
mortal
combat
and
let
him
who
survives
take
her
for
his
bride
this
saying
pleased
the
emperor
and
was
accepted
by
the
prince
for
he
thought
that
by
the
aid
of
his
unknown
champion
he
should
surely
triumph
in
the
fight
proclamation
was
therefore
made
for
rogero
to
appear
and
defend
his
suit
and
leo
on
his
part
caused
search
to
be
made
on
all
sides
for
the
knight
of
the
unicorn
meanwhile
rogero
overwhelmed
with
despair
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
in
the
forest
night
and
day
without
food
courting
death
here
he
was
discovered
by
one
of
leo
people
who
finding
him
resist
all
attempts
to
remove
him
hastened
to
his
master
who
was
not
far
off
and
brought
him
to
the
spot
as
he
approached
he
heard
words
which
convinced
him
that
love
was
the
cause
of
the
knight
despair
but
no
clew
was
given
to
guide
him
to
the
object
of
that
love
stooping
down
the
prince
embraced
the
weeping
warrior
and
in
the
tenderest
accents
said
spare
not
i
entreat
you
to
disclose
the
cause
of
your
distress
for
few
such
desperate
evils
betide
mankind
as
are
wholly
past
cure
it
grieves
me
much
that
you
would
hide
your
grief
from
me
for
i
am
bound
to
you
by
ties
that
nothing
can
undo
tell
me
then
your
grief
and
leave
me
to
try
if
wealth
art
cunning
force
or
persuasion
can
not
relieve
you
if
not
it
will
be
time
enough
after
all
has
been
tried
in
vain
to
die
he
spoke
in
such
moving
accents
that
rogero
could
not
choose
but
yield
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
command
utterance
at
last
he
said
my
lord
when
you
shall
know
me
for
what
i
am
i
doubt
not
you
like
myself
will
be
content
that
i
should
die
know
then
i
am
that
rogero
whom
you
have
so
much
cause
to
hate
and
who
so
hated
you
that
intent
on
putting
you
to
death
he
went
to
seek
you
at
your
father
court
this
i
did
because
i
could
not
submit
to
see
my
promised
bride
borne
off
by
you
but
as
man
proposes
and
god
disposes
your
great
courtesy
well
tried
in
time
of
sore
need
so
moved
my
fixed
resolve
that
i
not
only
laid
aside
the
hate
i
bore
but
purposed
to
be
your
friend
forever
you
then
asked
of
me
to
win
for
you
the
lady
bradamante
which
was
all
one
as
to
demand
of
me
my
heart
and
soul
you
know
whether
i
served
you
faithfully
or
not
yours
is
the
lady
possess
her
in
peace
but
ask
me
not
to
live
to
see
it
be
content
rather
that
i
die
for
vows
have
passed
between
myself
and
her
which
forbid
that
while
i
live
she
can
lawfully
wive
with
another
so
filled
was
gentle
leo
with
astonishment
at
these
words
that
for
a
while
he
stood
silent
with
lips
unmoved
and
steadfast
gaze
like
a
statue
and
the
discovery
that
the
stranger
was
rogero
not
only
abated
not
the
good
will
he
bore
him
but
increased
it
so
that
his
distress
for
what
rogero
suffered
seemed
equal
to
his
own
for
this
and
because
he
would
appear
deservedly
an
son
and
though
in
other
things
outdone
would
not
be
surpassed
in
courtesy
he
says
rogero
had
i
known
that
day
when
your
matchless
valor
routed
my
troops
that
you
were
rogero
your
virtue
would
have
made
me
your
own
as
then
it
made
me
while
i
knew
not
my
foe
and
i
should
have
no
less
gladly
rescued
you
from
theodora
dungeon
and
if
i
would
willingly
have
done
so
then
how
much
more
gladly
will
i
now
restore
the
gift
of
which
you
would
rob
yourself
to
confer
it
upon
me
the
damsel
is
more
due
to
you
than
to
me
and
though
i
know
her
worth
i
would
forego
not
only
her
but
life
itself
rather
than
distress
a
knight
like
you
this
and
much
more
he
said
to
the
same
intent
till
at
last
rogero
replied
i
yield
and
am
content
to
live
and
thus
a
second
time
owe
my
life
to
you
but
several
days
elapsed
before
rogero
was
so
far
restored
as
to
return
to
the
royal
residence
where
an
embassy
had
arrived
from
the
bulgarian
princes
to
seek
the
knight
of
the
unicorn
and
tender
to
him
the
crown
of
that
country
in
place
of
their
king
fallen
in
battle
thus
were
things
situated
when
prince
leo
leading
by
the
hand
rogero
clad
in
the
battered
armor
in
which
he
had
sustained
the
conflict
with
bradamante
presented
himself
before
the
king
behold
he
said
the
champion
who
maintained
from
dawn
to
setting
sun
the
arduous
contest
he
comes
to
claim
the
guerdon
of
the
fight
king
charlemagne
with
all
his
peerage
stood
amazed
for
all
believed
that
the
grecian
prince
himself
had
fought
with
bradamante
then
stepped
forth
marphisa
and
said
since
rogero
is
not
here
to
assert
his
rights
i
his
sister
undertake
his
cause
and
will
maintain
it
against
whoever
shall
dare
dispute
his
claim
she
said
this
with
so
much
anger
and
disdain
that
the
prince
deemed
it
no
longer
wise
to
feign
and
withdrew
helmet
from
his
brow
saying
behold
him
here
who
can
describe
the
astonishment
and
joy
of
marphisa
she
ran
and
threw
her
arms
about
her
brother
neck
nor
would
give
way
to
let
charlemagne
and
rinaldo
orlando
dudon
and
the
rest
who
crowded
round
embrace
him
and
press
friendly
kisses
on
his
brow
the
joyful
tidings
flew
fast
by
many
a
messenger
to
bradamante
who
in
her
secret
chamber
lay
lamenting
the
blood
that
stagnated
about
her
heart
flowed
at
that
notice
so
fast
that
she
had
wellnigh
died
for
joy
duke
aymon
and
the
lady
beatrice
no
longer
withheld
their
consent
and
pledged
their
daughter
to
the
brave
rogero
before
all
that
gallant
company
now
came
the
bulgarian
ambassadors
and
kneeling
at
the
feet
of
rogero
besought
him
to
return
with
them
to
their
country
where
in
adrianople
the
crown
and
sceptre
were
awaiting
his
acceptance
prince
leo
united
his
persuasions
to
theirs
and
promised
in
his
royal
father
name
that
peace
should
be
restored
on
their
part
rogero
gave
his
consent
and
it
was
surmised
that
none
of
the
virtues
which
shone
so
conspicuously
in
him
so
availed
to
recommend
rogero
to
the
lady
beatrice
as
the
hearing
her
future
saluted
as
a
sovereign
prince
the
battle
of
roncesvalles
after
the
expulsion
of
the
saracens
from
france
charlemagne
led
his
army
into
spain
to
punish
marsilius
the
king
of
that
country
for
having
sided
with
the
african
saracens
in
the
late
war
charlemagne
succeeded
in
all
his
attempts
and
compelled
marsilius
to
submit
and
pay
tribute
to
france
our
readers
will
remember
gano
otherwise
called
gan
or
ganelon
whom
we
mentioned
in
one
of
our
early
chapters
as
an
old
courtier
of
charlemagne
and
a
deadly
enemy
of
orlando
rinaldo
and
all
their
friends
he
had
great
influence
over
charles
from
equality
of
age
and
long
intimacy
and
he
was
not
without
good
qualities
he
was
brave
and
sagacious
but
envious
false
and
treacherous
gan
prevailed
on
charles
to
send
him
as
ambassador
to
marsilius
to
arrange
the
tribute
he
embraced
orlando
over
and
over
again
at
taking
leave
using
such
pains
to
seem
loving
and
sincere
that
his
hypocrisy
was
manifest
to
every
one
but
the
old
monarch
he
fastened
with
equal
tenderness
on
oliver
who
smiled
contemptuously
in
his
face
and
thought
to
himself
you
may
make
as
many
fair
speeches
as
you
choose
but
you
lie
all
the
other
paladins
who
were
present
thought
the
same
and
they
said
as
much
to
the
emperor
adding
that
gan
should
on
no
account
be
sent
ambassador
to
the
spaniards
but
charles
was
infatuated
gan
was
received
with
great
honor
by
marsilius
the
king
attended
by
his
lords
came
fifteen
miles
out
of
saragossa
to
meet
him
and
then
conducted
him
into
the
city
with
acclamations
there
was
nothing
for
several
days
but
balls
games
and
exhibitions
of
chivalry
the
ladies
throwing
flowers
on
the
heads
of
the
french
knights
and
the
people
shouting
france
mountjoy
and
st
denis
after
the
ceremonies
of
the
first
reception
the
king
and
the
ambassador
began
to
understand
one
another
one
day
they
sat
together
in
a
garden
on
the
border
of
a
fountain
the
water
was
so
clear
and
smooth
it
reflected
every
object
around
and
the
spot
was
encircled
with
which
quivered
with
the
fresh
air
as
they
sat
and
talked
as
if
without
restraint
gan
without
looking
the
king
in
the
face
was
enabled
to
see
the
expression
of
his
countenance
in
the
water
and
governed
his
speech
accordingly
marsilius
was
equally
adroit
and
watched
the
face
of
gan
while
he
addressed
him
marsilius
began
by
lamenting
not
as
to
the
ambassador
but
as
to
the
friend
the
injuries
which
charles
had
done
him
by
invading
his
dominions
charging
him
with
wishing
to
take
his
kingdom
from
him
and
give
it
to
orlando
till
at
length
he
plainly
uttered
his
belief
that
if
that
ambitious
paladin
were
but
dead
good
men
would
get
their
rights
gan
heaved
a
sigh
as
if
he
was
unwillingly
compelled
to
allow
the
force
of
what
the
king
said
but
unable
to
contain
himself
long
he
lifted
up
his
face
radiant
with
triumphant
wickedness
and
exclaimed
every
word
you
utter
is
truth
die
he
must
and
die
also
must
oliver
who
struck
me
that
foul
blow
at
court
is
it
treachery
to
punish
affronts
like
these
i
have
planned
everything
i
have
settled
everything
already
with
their
besotted
master
orlando
will
come
to
your
borders
to
roncesvalles
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
the
tribute
charles
will
await
him
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
orlando
will
bring
but
a
small
band
with
him
you
when
you
meet
him
will
have
secretly
your
whole
army
at
your
back
you
surround
him
and
who
receives
tribute
then
the
new
judas
had
scarcely
uttered
these
words
when
his
exultation
was
interrupted
by
a
change
in
the
face
of
nature
the
sky
was
suddenly
overcast
there
was
thunder
and
lightning
a
laurel
was
split
in
two
from
head
to
foot
and
the
under
which
gan
was
sitting
which
is
said
to
be
the
species
of
tree
on
which
judas
iscariot
hung
himself
dropped
one
of
its
pods
on
his
head
marsilius
as
well
as
gan
was
appalled
at
this
omen
but
on
assembling
his
soothsayers
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
turned
the
omen
against
the
emperor
the
successor
of
the
caesars
though
one
of
them
renewed
the
consternation
of
gan
by
saying
that
he
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
the
tree
of
judas
and
intimating
that
perhaps
the
ambassador
could
explain
it
gan
relieved
his
vexation
by
anger
the
habit
of
wickedness
prevailed
over
all
other
considerations
and
the
king
prepared
to
march
to
roncesvalles
at
the
head
of
all
his
forces
gan
wrote
to
charlemagne
to
say
how
humbly
and
submissively
marsilius
was
coming
to
pay
the
tribute
into
the
hands
of
orlando
and
how
handsome
it
would
be
of
the
emperor
to
meet
him
and
so
be
ready
to
receive
him
after
the
payment
at
his
camp
he
added
a
brilliant
account
of
the
tribute
and
the
accompanying
presents
the
good
emperor
wrote
in
turn
to
say
how
pleased
he
was
with
the
ambassador
diligence
and
that
matters
were
arranged
precisely
as
he
wished
his
court
however
had
its
suspicion
still
though
they
little
thought
gan
object
in
bringing
charles
into
the
neighborhood
of
roncesvalles
was
to
deliver
him
into
the
hands
of
marsilius
after
orlando
should
have
been
destroyed
by
him
orlando
however
did
as
his
lord
and
sovereign
desired
he
went
to
roncesvalles
accompanied
by
a
moderate
train
of
warriors
not
dreaming
of
the
atrocity
that
awaited
him
gan
meanwhile
had
hastened
back
to
france
in
order
to
show
himself
free
and
easy
in
the
presence
of
charles
and
secure
the
success
of
his
plot
while
marsilius
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
brought
into
the
passes
of
roncesvalles
no
less
than
three
armies
which
were
successively
to
fall
on
the
paladin
in
case
of
the
worst
and
so
extinguish
him
with
numbers
he
had
also
by
gan
advice
brought
heaps
of
wine
and
good
cheer
to
be
set
before
his
victims
in
the
first
instance
for
that
said
the
traitor
will
render
the
onset
the
more
effective
the
feasters
being
unarmed
one
thing
however
i
must
not
forget
added
he
my
son
baldwin
is
sure
to
be
with
orlando
you
must
take
care
of
his
life
for
my
sake
i
give
him
this
vesture
off
my
own
body
said
the
king
let
him
wear
it
in
the
battle
and
have
no
fear
my
soldiers
shall
be
directed
not
to
touch
him
gan
went
away
rejoicing
to
france
he
embraced
the
sovereign
and
the
court
all
round
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
brought
them
nothing
but
blessings
and
the
old
king
wept
for
very
tenderness
and
delight
something
is
going
on
wrong
and
looks
very
black
thought
malagigi
the
good
wizard
rinaldo
is
not
here
and
it
is
indispensably
necessary
that
he
should
be
i
must
find
out
where
he
is
and
ricciardetto
too
and
send
for
them
with
all
speed
malagigi
called
up
by
his
art
a
wise
terrible
and
cruel
spirit
named
ashtaroth
tell
me
and
tell
me
truly
of
rinaldo
said
malagigi
to
the
spirit
the
demon
looked
hard
at
the
paladin
and
said
nothing
his
aspect
was
clouded
and
violent
the
enchanter
with
an
aspect
still
cloudier
bade
ashtaroth
lay
down
that
look
and
made
signs
as
if
he
would
resort
to
angrier
compulsion
and
the
devil
alarmed
loosened
his
tongue
and
said
you
have
not
told
me
what
you
desire
to
know
of
rinaldo
i
desire
to
know
what
he
has
been
doing
and
where
he
is
he
has
been
conquering
and
baptizing
the
world
east
and
west
said
the
demon
and
is
now
in
egypt
with
ricciardetto
and
what
has
gan
been
plotting
with
marsilius
inquired
malagigi
and
what
is
to
come
of
it
i
know
not
said
the
devil
i
was
not
attending
to
gan
at
the
time
and
we
fallen
spirits
know
not
the
future
all
i
discern
is
that
by
the
signs
and
comets
in
the
heavens
something
dreadful
is
about
to
happen
something
very
strange
treacherous
and
bloody
and
that
gan
has
a
seat
ready
prepared
for
him
in
hell
within
three
days
cried
the
enchanter
loudly
bring
rinaldo
and
ricciardetto
into
the
pass
of
do
it
and
i
hereby
undertake
to
summon
thee
no
more
suppose
they
will
not
trust
themselves
with
me
said
the
spirit
enter
rinaldo
horse
and
bring
him
whether
he
trust
thee
or
not
it
shall
be
done
returned
the
demon
there
was
an
earthquake
and
ashtaroth
disappeared
marsilius
now
made
his
first
movement
towards
the
destruction
of
orlando
by
sending
before
him
his
vassal
king
blanchardin
with
his
presents
of
wines
and
other
luxuries
the
temperate
but
courteous
hero
took
them
in
good
part
and
distributed
them
as
the
traitor
wished
and
then
blanchardin
on
pretence
of
going
forward
to
salute
charlemagne
returned
and
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
second
army
which
was
the
post
assigned
him
by
his
lord
king
falseron
whose
son
orlando
had
slain
in
battle
headed
the
first
army
and
king
balugante
the
third
marsilius
made
a
speech
to
them
in
which
he
let
them
into
his
design
and
concluded
by
recommending
to
their
good
will
the
son
of
his
friend
gan
whom
they
would
know
by
the
vest
he
had
sent
him
and
who
was
the
only
soul
amongst
the
christian
they
were
to
spare
this
son
of
gan
meanwhile
and
several
of
the
paladins
who
distrusted
the
misbelievers
and
were
anxious
at
all
events
to
be
with
orlando
had
joined
the
hero
in
the
fatal
valley
so
that
the
little
christian
host
considering
the
tremendous
valor
of
their
lord
and
his
friends
were
not
to
be
sold
for
nothing
rinaldo
alas
the
second
thunderbolt
of
christendom
was
destined
not
to
be
there
in
time
to
meet
the
issue
the
paladins
in
vain
begged
orlando
to
be
on
his
guard
against
treachery
and
send
for
a
more
numerous
body
of
men
the
great
heart
of
the
champion
of
the
faith
was
unwilling
to
harbor
suspicion
as
long
as
he
could
help
it
he
refused
to
summon
aid
which
might
be
superfluous
neither
would
he
do
anything
but
what
his
had
directed
and
yet
he
could
not
wholly
repress
a
misgiving
a
shadow
had
fallen
on
his
heart
great
and
cheerful
as
it
was
the
anticipations
of
his
friends
disturbed
him
in
spite
of
the
face
with
which
he
met
them
perhaps
by
a
certain
foresight
he
felt
his
death
approaching
but
he
felt
bound
not
to
encourage
the
impression
besides
time
pressed
the
moment
of
the
tribute
was
at
hand
and
little
combinations
of
circumstances
determine
often
the
greatest
events
king
marsilius
was
to
arrive
early
next
day
with
the
tribute
and
oliver
with
the
morning
sun
rode
forth
to
reconnoitre
and
see
if
he
could
discover
the
peaceful
pomp
of
the
spanish
court
in
the
distance
he
rode
up
the
nearest
height
and
from
the
top
of
it
beheld
the
first
army
of
marsilius
already
forming
in
the
passes
o
devil
gan
he
exclaimed
this
then
is
the
consummation
of
thy
labors
oliver
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
galloped
back
down
the
mountain
to
orlando
well
cried
the
hero
what
news
bad
news
said
his
cousin
such
as
you
would
not
hear
of
yesterday
marsilius
is
here
in
arms
and
all
the
world
is
with
him
the
paladins
pressed
round
orlando
and
entreated
him
to
sound
his
horn
in
token
that
he
needed
help
his
only
answer
was
to
mount
his
horse
and
ride
up
the
mountain
with
sansonetto
as
soon
however
as
he
cast
forth
his
eyes
and
beheld
what
was
round
about
him
he
turned
in
sorrow
and
looked
down
into
roncesvalles
and
said
o
miserable
valley
the
blood
shed
in
thee
this
day
will
color
thy
name
forever
orlando
little
camp
were
furious
against
the
saracens
they
armed
themselves
with
the
greatest
impatience
there
was
nothing
but
lacing
of
helmets
and
mounting
of
horses
while
good
archbishop
turpin
went
from
rank
to
rank
exhorting
and
encouraging
the
warriors
of
christ
orlando
and
his
captains
withdrew
for
a
moment
to
consultation
he
fairly
groaned
for
sorrow
and
at
first
had
not
a
word
to
say
so
wretched
he
felt
at
having
brought
his
people
to
die
in
roncesvalles
then
he
said
if
it
had
entered
into
my
heart
to
conceive
the
king
of
spain
to
be
such
a
villain
never
would
you
have
seen
this
day
he
has
exchanged
with
me
a
thousand
courtesies
and
good
words
and
i
thought
that
the
worse
enemies
we
had
been
before
the
better
friends
we
had
become
now
i
fancied
every
human
being
capable
of
this
kind
of
virtue
on
a
good
opportunity
saving
indeed
such
wretches
as
can
never
forgive
their
very
forgivers
and
of
these
i
did
not
suppose
him
to
be
one
let
us
die
if
die
we
must
like
honest
and
gallant
men
so
that
it
shall
be
said
of
us
it
was
only
our
bodies
that
died
the
reason
why
i
did
not
sound
the
horn
was
partly
because
i
thought
it
did
not
become
us
and
partly
because
our
liege
lord
could
hardly
save
us
even
if
he
heard
it
and
with
these
words
orlando
sprang
to
his
horse
crying
aways
against
the
saracens
but
he
had
no
sooner
turned
his
face
than
he
wept
bitterly
and
said
o
holy
virgin
think
not
of
me
the
sinner
orlando
but
have
pity
on
these
thy
servants
and
now
with
a
mighty
dust
and
an
infinite
sound
of
horns
and
tambours
which
came
filling
the
valley
the
first
army
of
the
infidels
made
its
appearance
horses
neighing
and
a
thousand
pennons
flying
in
the
air
king
falseron
led
them
on
saying
to
his
officers
let
nobody
dare
to
lay
a
finger
on
orlando
he
belongs
to
myself
the
revenge
of
my
son
death
is
mine
i
will
cut
the
man
down
that
comes
between
us
now
friends
said
orlando
every
man
for
himself
and
michael
for
us
all
there
is
not
one
here
that
is
not
a
perfect
knight
and
he
might
well
say
it
for
the
flower
of
all
france
was
there
except
rinaldo
and
ricciardetto
every
man
a
picked
man
all
friends
and
constant
companions
of
orlando
so
the
captains
of
the
little
troop
and
of
the
great
army
sat
looking
at
one
another
and
singling
one
another
out
as
the
latter
came
on
and
then
the
knights
put
spear
in
rest
and
ran
for
a
while
two
and
two
in
succession
one
against
the
other
astolpho
was
the
first
to
move
he
ran
against
arlotto
of
sorio
and
thrust
his
antagonist
body
out
of
the
saddle
and
his
soul
into
the
other
world
oliver
encountered
malprimo
and
though
he
received
a
thrust
which
hurt
him
sent
his
lance
right
through
the
heart
of
malprimo
falseron
was
daunted
at
this
blow
truly
thought
he
this
is
a
marvel
oliver
did
not
press
on
among
the
saracens
his
wound
was
too
painful
but
orlando
now
put
himself
and
his
whole
band
in
motion
and
you
may
guess
what
an
uproar
ensued
the
sound
of
the
rattling
of
blows
and
helmets
was
as
if
the
forge
of
vulcan
had
been
thrown
open
falseron
beheld
orlando
coming
so
furiously
that
he
thought
him
a
lucifer
who
had
burst
his
chain
and
was
quite
of
another
mind
than
when
he
purposed
to
have
him
all
to
himself
on
the
contrary
he
recommended
himself
to
his
gods
and
turned
away
meaning
to
wait
for
a
more
auspicious
season
of
revenge
but
orlando
hailed
him
with
a
terrible
voice
saying
o
thou
traitor
was
this
the
end
to
which
old
quarrels
were
made
up
then
he
dashed
at
falseron
with
a
fury
so
swift
and
at
the
same
time
with
a
mastery
of
his
lance
so
marvellous
that
though
he
plunged
it
in
the
man
body
so
as
instantly
to
kill
him
and
then
withdrew
it
the
body
did
not
move
in
the
saddle
the
hero
himself
as
he
rushed
onwards
was
fain
to
see
the
end
of
a
stroke
so
perfect
and
turning
his
horse
back
touched
the
carcass
with
his
sword
and
it
fell
on
the
instant
when
the
infidels
beheld
their
leader
dead
such
fear
fell
upon
them
that
they
were
for
leaving
the
field
to
the
paladins
but
they
were
unable
marsilius
had
drawn
the
rest
of
his
forces
round
the
valley
like
a
net
so
that
their
shoulders
were
turned
in
vain
orlando
rode
into
the
thick
of
them
and
wherever
he
went
thunderbolts
fell
upon
helmets
oliver
was
again
in
the
fray
with
walter
and
baldwin
avino
and
avolio
while
turpin
had
changed
his
crosier
for
a
lance
and
chased
a
new
flock
before
him
to
the
mountains
yet
what
could
be
done
against
foes
without
number
marsilius
constantly
pours
them
in
the
paladins
are
as
units
to
thousands
why
tarry
the
horses
of
rinaldo
and
ricciardetto
the
horses
did
not
tarry
but
fate
had
been
quicker
than
enchantment
ashtaroth
had
presented
himself
to
rinaldo
in
egypt
and
after
telling
his
errand
he
and
his
servant
entered
the
horses
of
rinaldo
and
ricciardetto
which
began
to
neigh
and
snort
and
leap
with
the
fiends
within
them
till
off
they
flew
through
the
air
over
the
pyramids
and
across
the
desert
and
reached
spain
and
the
scene
of
action
just
as
marsilius
brought
up
his
third
army
the
two
paladins
on
their
horses
dropped
right
into
the
midst
of
the
saracens
and
began
making
such
havoc
among
them
that
marsilius
who
overlooked
the
fight
from
a
mountain
thought
his
soldiers
had
turned
against
one
another
orlando
beheld
it
and
guessed
it
could
be
no
other
but
his
cousins
and
pressed
to
meet
them
oliver
coming
up
at
the
same
moment
the
rapture
of
the
whole
party
is
not
to
be
expressed
after
a
few
hasty
words
of
explanation
they
were
forced
to
turn
again
upon
the
enemy
whose
numbers
seemed
perfectly
without
limit
orlando
making
a
bloody
passage
towards
marsilius
struck
a
youth
on
the
head
whose
helmet
was
so
strong
as
to
resist
the
blow
but
at
the
same
time
flew
off
orlando
prepared
to
strike
a
second
blow
when
the
youth
exclaimed
hold
you
loved
my
father
i
am
bujaforte
the
paladin
had
never
seen
bujaforte
but
he
saw
the
likeness
to
the
good
old
man
his
father
and
he
dropped
his
sword
o
bujaforte
said
he
i
loved
him
indeed
but
what
does
his
son
do
here
fighting
against
his
friends
bujaforte
could
not
at
once
speak
for
weeping
at
length
he
said
i
am
forced
to
be
here
by
my
lord
and
master
marsilius
and
i
have
made
a
show
of
fighting
but
have
not
hurt
a
single
christian
treachery
is
on
every
side
of
you
baldwin
himself
has
a
vest
given
him
by
marsilius
that
everybody
may
know
the
son
of
his
friend
gan
and
do
him
no
harm
put
your
helmet
on
again
said
orlando
and
behave
just
as
you
have
done
never
will
your
father
friend
be
an
enemy
to
the
son
the
hero
then
turned
in
fury
to
look
for
baldwin
who
was
hastening
towards
him
at
that
moment
with
friendliness
in
his
looks
is
strange
said
baldwin
i
have
done
my
duty
as
well
as
i
could
yet
nobody
will
come
against
me
i
have
slain
right
and
left
and
can
not
comprehend
what
it
is
that
makes
the
stoutest
infidels
avoid
me
take
off
your
vest
said
orlando
contemptuously
and
you
will
soon
discover
the
secret
if
you
wish
to
know
it
your
father
has
sold
us
to
marsilius
all
but
his
honorable
son
if
my
father
said
baldwin
impetuously
tearing
off
the
vest
has
been
such
a
villain
and
i
escape
dying
i
will
plunge
this
sword
through
his
heart
but
i
am
no
traitor
orlando
and
you
do
me
wrong
to
say
it
think
not
i
can
live
with
dishonor
baldwin
spurred
off
into
the
fight
not
waiting
to
hear
another
word
from
orlando
who
was
very
sorry
for
what
he
had
said
for
he
perceived
that
the
youth
was
in
despair
and
now
the
fight
raged
beyond
all
it
had
done
before
twenty
pagans
went
down
for
one
paladin
but
still
the
paladins
fell
sansonetto
was
beaten
to
earth
by
the
club
of
grandonio
walter
had
his
shoulder
broken
berlinghieri
and
ottone
were
slain
and
at
last
astolpho
fell
in
revenge
of
whose
death
orlando
turned
the
spot
where
he
died
into
a
lake
of
saracen
blood
the
luckless
bujaforte
met
rinaldo
and
before
he
could
explain
how
he
seemed
to
be
fighting
on
the
saracen
side
received
such
a
blow
upon
the
head
that
he
fell
unable
to
utter
a
word
orlando
cutting
his
way
to
a
spot
where
there
was
a
great
struggle
and
uproar
found
the
poor
youth
baldwin
the
son
of
gan
with
two
spears
in
his
breast
i
am
no
traitor
now
said
baldwin
and
those
were
the
last
words
he
said
orlando
was
bitterly
sorry
to
have
been
the
cause
of
his
death
and
tears
streamed
from
his
eyes
at
length
down
went
oliver
himself
he
had
become
blinded
with
his
own
blood
and
smitten
orlando
without
knowing
him
how
now
cousin
cried
orlando
have
you
too
gone
over
to
the
enemy
o
my
lord
and
master
cried
the
other
i
ask
your
pardon
i
can
see
nothing
i
am
dying
some
traitor
has
stabbed
me
in
the
back
if
you
love
me
lead
my
horse
into
the
thick
of
them
so
that
i
may
not
die
unavenged
i
shall
die
myself
before
long
said
orlando
out
of
very
toil
and
grief
so
we
will
go
together
orlando
led
his
cousin
horse
where
the
press
was
thickest
and
dreadful
was
the
strength
of
the
dying
man
and
his
tired
companion
they
made
a
street
through
which
they
passed
out
of
the
battle
and
orlando
led
his
cousin
away
to
his
tent
and
said
wait
a
little
till
i
return
for
i
will
go
and
sound
the
horn
on
the
hill
yonder
is
of
no
use
said
oliver
my
spirit
is
fast
going
and
desires
to
be
with
its
lord
and
saviour
he
would
have
said
more
but
his
words
came
from
him
imperfectly
like
those
of
a
man
in
a
dream
and
so
he
expired
when
orlando
saw
him
dead
he
felt
as
if
he
was
alone
on
the
earth
and
he
was
quite
willing
to
leave
it
only
he
wished
that
king
charles
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
should
know
how
the
case
stood
before
he
went
so
he
took
up
the
horn
and
blew
it
three
times
with
such
force
that
the
blood
burst
out
of
his
nose
and
mouth
turpin
says
that
at
the
third
blast
the
horn
broke
in
two
in
spite
of
all
the
noise
of
the
battle
the
sound
of
the
horn
broke
over
it
like
a
voice
out
of
the
other
world
they
say
that
birds
fell
dead
at
it
and
that
the
whole
saracen
army
drew
back
in
terror
charlemagne
was
sitting
in
the
midst
of
his
court
when
the
sound
reached
him
and
gan
was
there
the
emperor
was
the
first
to
hear
it
do
you
hear
that
said
he
to
his
nobles
did
you
hear
the
horn
as
i
heard
it
upon
this
they
all
listened
and
gan
felt
his
heart
misgive
him
the
horn
sounded
a
second
time
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
said
charles
orlando
is
hunting
observed
gan
and
the
stag
is
killed
but
when
the
horn
sounded
yet
a
third
time
and
the
blast
was
one
of
so
dreadful
a
vehemence
everybody
looked
at
the
other
and
then
they
all
looked
at
gan
in
a
fury
charles
rose
from
his
seat
this
is
no
hunting
of
the
stag
said
he
the
sound
goes
to
my
very
heart
o
gan
o
gan
not
for
thee
do
i
blush
but
for
myself
o
foul
and
monstrous
villain
take
him
gentleman
and
keep
him
in
close
prison
would
to
god
i
had
not
lived
to
see
this
day
but
it
was
no
time
for
words
they
put
the
traitor
in
prison
and
then
charles
with
all
his
court
took
his
way
to
roncesvalles
grieving
and
praying
it
was
afternoon
when
the
horn
sounded
and
half
an
hour
after
it
when
the
emperor
set
out
and
meantime
orlando
had
returned
to
the
fight
that
he
might
do
his
duty
however
hopeless
as
long
as
he
could
sit
his
horse
at
length
he
found
his
end
approaching
for
toil
and
fever
and
rode
all
alone
to
a
fountain
where
he
had
before
quenched
his
thirst
his
horse
was
wearier
than
he
and
no
sooner
had
his
master
alighted
than
the
beast
kneeling
down
as
if
to
take
leave
and
to
say
i
have
brought
you
to
a
place
of
rest
fell
dead
at
his
feet
orlando
cast
water
on
him
from
the
fountain
not
wishing
to
believe
him
dead
but
when
he
found
it
to
no
purpose
he
grieved
for
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
human
being
and
addressed
him
by
name
with
tears
and
asked
forgiveness
if
he
had
ever
done
him
wrong
they
say
that
the
horse
at
these
words
opened
his
eyes
a
little
and
looked
kindly
at
his
master
and
then
stirred
never
more
they
say
also
that
orlando
then
summoning
all
his
strength
smote
a
rock
near
him
with
his
beautiful
sword
durindana
thinking
to
shiver
the
steel
in
pieces
and
so
prevent
its
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
but
though
the
rock
split
like
a
slate
and
a
great
cleft
remained
ever
after
to
astonish
the
eyes
of
pilgrims
the
sword
remained
uninjured
and
now
rinaldo
and
ricciardetto
came
up
with
turpin
having
driven
back
the
saracens
and
told
orlando
that
the
battle
was
won
then
orlando
knelt
before
turpin
and
begged
remission
of
his
sins
and
turpin
gave
him
absolution
orlando
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
as
on
a
crucifix
and
embraced
it
and
he
raised
his
eyes
and
appeared
like
a
creature
seraphical
and
transfigured
and
bowing
his
head
he
breathed
out
his
pure
soul
and
now
king
charles
and
his
nobles
came
up
the
emperor
at
sight
of
the
dead
orlando
threw
himself
as
if
he
had
been
a
reckless
youth
from
his
horse
and
embraced
and
kissed
the
body
and
said
i
bless
thee
orlando
i
bless
thy
whole
life
and
all
that
thou
wast
and
all
that
thou
ever
didst
and
the
father
that
begat
thee
and
i
ask
pardon
of
thee
for
believing
those
who
brought
thee
to
thine
end
they
shall
have
their
reward
o
thou
beloved
one
but
indeed
it
is
thou
that
livest
and
i
who
am
worse
than
dead
horrible
to
the
emperor
eyes
was
the
sight
of
the
field
of
roncesvalles
the
saracens
indeed
had
fled
conquered
but
all
his
paladins
but
two
were
left
on
it
dead
and
the
whole
valley
looked
like
a
great
trampled
into
blood
and
dirt
and
reeking
to
the
heat
charles
trembled
to
his
heart
core
for
wonder
and
agony
after
gazing
dumbly
on
the
place
he
cursed
it
with
a
solemn
curse
and
wished
that
never
grass
might
grow
in
it
again
nor
seed
of
any
kind
neither
within
it
nor
on
any
of
its
mountains
around
but
the
anger
of
heaven
abide
over
it
forever
charles
and
his
warriors
went
after
the
saracens
into
spain
they
took
and
fired
saragossa
and
marsilius
was
hung
to
the
under
which
he
had
planned
his
villainy
with
gan
and
gan
was
hung
and
drawn
and
quartered
in
roncesvalles
amidst
the
execrations
of
the
country
rinaldo
and
bayard
charlemagne
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
at
the
loss
of
so
many
of
his
bravest
warriors
at
the
disaster
of
roncesvalles
and
bitterly
reproached
himself
for
his
credulity
in
resigning
himself
so
completely
to
the
counsels
of
the
treacherous
count
gan
yet
he
soon
fell
into
a
similar
snare
when
he
suffered
his
unworthy
son
charlot
to
acquire
such
an
influence
over
him
that
he
constantly
led
him
into
acts
of
cruelty
and
injustice
that
in
his
right
mind
he
would
have
scorned
to
commit
rinaldo
and
his
brothers
for
some
slight
offence
to
the
imperious
young
prince
were
forced
to
fly
from
paris
and
to
take
shelter
in
their
castle
of
montalban
for
charles
had
publicly
said
if
he
could
take
them
he
would
hang
them
all
he
sent
numbers
of
his
bravest
knights
to
arrest
them
but
all
without
success
either
rinaldo
foiled
their
efforts
and
sent
them
back
stripped
of
their
armor
and
of
their
glory
or
after
meeting
and
conferring
with
him
they
came
back
and
told
the
king
they
could
not
be
his
instruments
for
such
a
work
at
last
charles
himself
raised
a
great
army
and
went
in
person
to
compel
the
paladin
to
submit
he
ravaged
all
the
country
round
about
montalban
so
that
supplies
of
food
should
be
cut
off
and
he
threatened
death
to
any
who
should
attempt
to
issue
forth
hoping
to
compel
the
garrison
to
submit
for
want
of
food
rinaldo
resources
had
been
brought
so
low
that
it
seemed
useless
to
contend
any
longer
his
brothers
had
been
taken
prisoners
in
a
skirmish
and
his
only
hope
of
saving
their
lives
was
in
making
terms
with
the
king
so
he
sent
a
messenger
offering
to
yield
himself
and
his
castle
if
the
king
would
spare
his
and
his
brothers
lives
while
the
messenger
was
gone
rinaldo
impatient
to
learn
what
tidings
he
might
bring
rode
out
to
meet
him
when
he
had
ridden
as
far
as
he
thought
prudent
he
stopped
in
a
wood
and
alighting
tied
bayard
to
a
tree
then
he
sat
down
and
as
he
waited
he
fell
asleep
bayard
meanwhile
got
loose
and
strayed
away
where
the
grass
tempted
him
just
then
came
along
some
country
people
who
said
to
one
another
look
is
not
that
the
great
horse
bayard
that
rinaldo
rides
let
us
take
him
and
carry
him
to
king
charles
who
will
pay
us
well
for
our
trouble
they
did
so
and
the
king
was
delighted
with
his
prize
and
gave
them
a
present
that
made
them
rich
to
their
dying
day
when
rinaldo
woke
he
looked
round
for
his
horse
and
finding
him
not
he
groaned
and
said
o
unlucky
hour
that
i
was
born
how
fortune
persecutes
me
so
desperate
was
he
that
he
took
off
his
armor
and
his
spurs
saying
what
need
have
i
of
these
since
bayard
is
lost
while
he
stood
thus
lamenting
a
man
came
from
the
thicket
seemingly
bent
with
age
he
had
a
long
beard
hanging
over
his
breast
and
eyebrows
that
almost
covered
his
eyes
he
bade
rinaldo
good
day
rinaldo
thanked
him
and
said
a
good
day
i
have
hardly
had
since
i
was
born
then
said
the
old
man
signor
rinaldo
you
must
not
despair
for
god
will
make
all
things
turn
to
the
best
rinaldo
answered
my
trouble
is
too
heavy
for
me
to
hope
relief
the
king
has
taken
my
brothers
and
means
to
put
them
to
death
i
thought
to
rescue
them
by
means
of
my
horse
bayard
but
while
i
slept
some
thief
has
stolen
him
the
old
man
replied
i
will
remember
you
and
your
brothers
in
my
prayers
i
am
a
poor
man
have
you
not
something
to
give
me
rinaldo
said
i
have
nothing
to
give
but
then
he
recollected
his
spurs
he
gave
them
to
the
beggar
and
said
here
take
my
spurs
they
are
the
first
present
my
mother
gave
me
when
my
father
count
aymon
dubbed
me
knight
they
ought
to
bring
you
ten
pounds
the
old
man
took
the
spurs
and
put
them
into
his
sack
and
said
noble
sir
have
you
nothing
else
you
can
give
me
rinaldo
replied
are
you
making
sport
of
me
i
tell
you
truly
if
it
were
not
for
shame
to
beat
one
so
helpless
i
would
teach
you
better
manners
the
old
man
said
of
a
truth
sir
if
you
did
so
you
would
do
a
great
sin
if
all
had
beaten
me
of
whom
i
have
begged
i
should
have
been
killed
long
ago
for
i
ask
alms
in
churches
and
convents
and
wherever
i
can
you
say
true
replied
rinaldo
if
you
did
not
ask
none
would
relieve
you
the
old
man
said
true
noble
sir
therefore
i
pray
if
you
have
anything
more
to
spare
give
it
me
rinaldo
gave
him
his
mantle
and
said
take
it
pilgrim
i
give
it
you
for
the
love
of
christ
that
god
would
save
my
brothers
from
a
shameful
death
and
help
me
to
escape
out
of
king
charles
power
the
pilgrim
took
the
mantle
folded
it
up
and
put
it
into
his
bag
then
a
third
time
he
said
to
rinaldo
sir
have
you
nothing
left
to
give
me
that
i
may
remember
you
in
my
prayers
wretch
exclaimed
rinaldo
do
you
make
me
your
sport
and
he
drew
his
sword
and
struck
at
him
but
the
old
man
warded
off
the
blow
with
his
staff
and
said
rinaldo
would
you
slay
your
cousin
malagigi
when
rinaldo
heard
that
he
stayed
his
hand
and
gazed
doubtingly
on
the
old
man
who
now
threw
aside
his
disguise
and
appeared
to
be
indeed
malagigi
dear
cousin
said
rinaldo
pray
forgive
me
i
did
not
know
you
next
to
god
my
trust
is
in
you
help
my
brothers
to
escape
out
of
prison
i
entreat
you
i
have
lost
my
horse
and
therefore
can
not
render
them
any
assistance
malagigi
answered
cousin
rinaldo
i
will
enable
you
to
recover
your
horse
meanwhile
you
must
do
as
i
say
then
malagigi
took
from
his
sack
a
gown
and
gave
it
to
rinaldo
to
put
on
over
his
armor
and
a
hat
that
was
full
of
holes
and
an
old
pair
of
shoes
to
put
on
they
looked
like
two
pilgrims
very
old
and
poor
then
they
went
forth
from
the
wood
and
after
a
little
while
saw
four
monks
riding
along
the
road
malagigi
said
to
rinaldo
i
will
go
meet
the
monks
and
see
what
news
i
can
learn
malagigi
learned
from
the
monks
that
on
the
approaching
festival
there
would
be
a
great
crowd
of
people
at
court
for
the
prince
was
going
to
show
the
ladies
the
famous
horse
bayard
that
used
to
belong
to
rinaldo
what
said
the
pilgrim
is
bayard
there
yes
answered
the
monks
the
king
has
given
him
to
charlot
and
after
the
prince
has
ridden
him
the
king
means
to
pass
sentence
on
the
brothers
of
rinaldo
and
have
them
hanged
then
malagigi
asked
alms
of
the
monks
but
they
would
give
him
none
till
he
threw
aside
his
pilgrim
garb
and
let
them
see
his
armor
when
partly
for
charity
and
partly
for
terror
they
gave
him
a
golden
cup
adorned
with
precious
stones
that
sparkled
in
the
sunshine
malagigi
then
hastened
back
to
rinaldo
and
told
him
what
he
had
learned
the
morning
of
the
rinaldo
and
malagigi
came
to
the
place
where
the
sports
were
to
be
held
malagigi
gave
rinaldo
his
spurs
back
again
and
said
cousin
put
on
your
spurs
for
you
will
need
them
how
shall
i
need
them
said
rinaldo
since
i
have
lost
my
horse
yet
he
did
as
malagigi
directed
him
when
the
two
had
taken
their
stand
on
the
border
of
the
field
among
the
crowd
the
princes
and
ladies
of
the
court
began
to
assemble
when
they
were
all
assembled
the
king
came
also
and
charlot
with
him
near
whom
the
horse
bayard
was
led
in
the
charge
of
grooms
who
were
expressly
enjoined
to
guard
him
safely
the
king
looking
round
on
the
circle
of
spectators
saw
malagigi
and
rinaldo
and
observed
the
splendid
cup
that
they
had
and
said
to
charlot
see
my
son
what
a
brilliant
cup
those
two
pilgrims
have
got
it
seems
to
be
worth
a
hundred
ducats
that
is
true
said
charlot
let
us
go
and
ask
where
they
got
it
so
they
rode
to
the
place
where
the
pilgrims
stood
and
charlot
stopped
bayard
close
to
them
the
horse
snuffed
at
the
pilgrims
knew
rinaldo
and
caressed
his
master
the
king
said
to
malagigi
friend
where
did
you
get
that
beautiful
cup
malagigi
replied
honorable
sir
i
paid
for
it
all
the
money
i
have
saved
from
eleven
years
begging
in
churches
and
convents
the
pope
himself
has
blessed
it
and
given
it
the
power
that
whosoever
eats
or
drinks
out
of
it
shall
be
pardoned
of
all
his
sins
then
said
the
king
to
charlot
my
son
these
are
right
holy
men
see
how
the
dumb
beast
worships
them
then
the
king
said
to
malagigi
give
me
a
morsel
from
your
cup
that
i
may
be
cleared
of
my
sins
malagigi
answered
illustrious
lord
i
dare
not
do
it
unless
you
will
forgive
all
who
have
at
any
time
offended
you
you
know
that
christ
forgave
all
those
who
had
betrayed
and
crucified
him
the
king
replied
friend
that
is
true
but
rinaldo
has
so
grievously
offended
me
that
i
can
not
forgive
him
nor
that
other
man
malagigi
the
magician
these
two
shall
never
live
in
my
kingdom
again
if
i
catch
them
i
will
certainly
have
them
hanged
but
tell
me
pilgrim
who
is
that
man
who
stands
beside
you
he
is
deaf
dumb
and
blind
said
malagigi
then
the
king
said
again
give
me
to
drink
of
your
cup
to
take
away
my
sins
malagigi
answered
my
lord
king
here
is
my
poor
brother
who
for
fifty
days
has
not
heard
spoken
nor
seen
this
misfortune
befell
him
in
a
house
where
we
found
shelter
and
the
day
before
yesterday
we
met
with
a
wise
woman
who
told
him
the
only
hope
of
a
cure
for
him
was
to
come
to
some
place
where
bayard
was
to
be
ridden
and
to
mount
and
ride
him
that
would
do
him
more
good
than
anything
else
then
said
the
king
friend
you
have
come
to
the
right
place
for
bayard
is
to
be
ridden
here
give
me
a
draught
from
your
cup
and
your
companion
shall
ride
upon
bayard
malagigi
hearing
these
words
said
be
it
so
then
the
king
with
great
devotion
took
a
spoon
and
dipped
a
portion
from
the
pilgrim
cup
believing
that
his
sins
should
be
thereby
forgiven
when
this
was
done
the
king
said
to
charlot
son
i
request
that
you
will
let
this
sick
pilgrim
sit
on
your
horse
and
ride
if
he
can
for
by
so
doing
he
will
be
healed
of
all
his
infirmities
charlot
replied
that
will
i
gladly
do
so
saying
he
dismounted
and
the
servants
took
the
pilgrim
in
their
arms
and
helped
him
on
the
horse
wher
rinaldo
was
mounted
he
put
his
feet
in
the
stirrups
and
said
i
would
like
to
ride
a
little
malagigi
hearing
him
speak
seemed
delighted
and
asked
him
whether
he
could
see
and
hear
also
yes
said
rinaldo
i
am
healed
of
all
my
infirmities
when
the
king
heard
it
he
said
to
bishop
turpin
my
lord
bishop
we
must
celebrate
this
with
a
procession
with
crosses
and
banners
for
it
is
a
great
miracle
when
rinaldo
remarked
that
he
was
not
carefully
watched
he
spoke
to
the
horse
and
touched
him
with
the
spurs
bayard
knew
that
his
master
was
upon
him
and
he
started
off
upon
a
rapid
pace
and
in
a
few
moments
was
a
good
way
off
malagigi
pretended
to
be
in
great
alarm
o
noble
king
and
master
he
cried
my
poor
companion
is
run
away
with
he
will
fall
and
break
his
neck
the
king
ordered
his
knights
to
ride
after
the
pilgrim
and
bring
him
back
or
help
him
if
need
were
they
did
so
but
it
was
in
vain
rinaldo
left
them
all
behind
him
and
kept
on
his
way
till
he
reached
montalban
malagigi
was
suffered
to
depart
unsuspected
and
he
went
his
way
making
sad
lamentation
for
the
fate
of
his
comrade
who
he
pretended
to
think
must
surely
be
dashed
to
pieces
malagigi
did
not
go
far
but
having
changed
his
disguise
returned
to
where
the
king
was
and
employed
his
best
art
in
getting
the
brothers
of
rinaldo
out
of
prison
he
succeeded
and
all
three
got
safely
to
montalban
where
rinaldo
joy
at
the
rescue
of
his
brothers
and
the
recovery
of
bayard
was
more
than
tongue
can
tell
death
of
rinaldo
the
distress
in
rinaldo
castle
for
want
of
food
grew
more
severe
every
day
under
the
pressure
of
the
siege
the
garrison
were
forced
to
kill
their
horses
both
to
save
the
provision
they
would
consume
and
to
make
food
of
their
flesh
at
last
all
the
horses
were
killed
except
bayard
and
rinaldo
said
to
his
brothers
bayard
must
die
for
we
have
nothing
else
to
eat
so
they
went
to
the
stable
and
brought
out
bayard
to
kill
him
but
alardo
said
brother
let
bayard
live
a
little
longer
who
knows
what
god
may
do
for
us
bayard
heard
these
words
and
understood
them
as
if
he
was
a
man
and
fell
on
his
knees
as
if
he
would
beg
for
mercy
when
rinaldo
saw
the
distress
of
his
horse
his
heart
failed
him
and
he
let
him
live
just
at
this
time
aya
rinaldo
mother
who
was
the
sister
of
the
emperor
came
to
the
camp
attended
by
knights
and
ladies
to
intercede
for
her
sons
she
fell
on
her
knees
before
the
king
and
besought
him
that
he
would
pardon
rinaldo
and
his
brothers
and
all
the
peers
and
knights
took
her
side
and
entreated
the
king
to
grant
her
prayer
then
said
the
king
dear
sister
you
act
the
part
of
a
good
mother
and
i
respect
your
tender
heart
and
yield
to
your
entreaties
i
will
spare
your
sons
their
lives
if
they
submit
implicitly
to
my
will
when
charlot
heard
this
he
approached
the
king
and
whispered
in
his
ear
and
the
king
turned
to
his
sister
and
said
charlot
must
have
bayard
because
i
have
given
the
horse
to
him
now
go
my
sister
and
tell
rinaldo
what
i
have
said
when
the
lady
aya
heard
these
words
she
was
delighted
thanked
god
in
her
heart
and
said
worthy
king
and
brother
i
will
do
as
you
bid
me
so
she
went
into
the
castle
where
her
sons
received
her
most
joyfully
and
affectionately
and
she
told
them
the
offer
then
alardo
said
brother
i
would
rather
have
the
enmity
than
give
bayard
to
charlot
for
i
believe
he
will
kill
him
likewise
said
all
the
brothers
when
rinaldo
heard
them
he
said
dear
brothers
if
we
may
win
our
forgiveness
by
giving
up
the
horse
so
be
it
let
us
make
our
peace
for
we
can
not
stand
against
the
king
power
then
he
went
to
his
mother
and
told
her
they
would
give
the
horse
to
charlot
and
more
too
if
the
king
would
pardon
them
and
forgive
all
that
they
had
done
against
his
crown
and
dignity
the
lady
returned
to
charles
and
told
him
the
answer
of
her
sons
when
the
peace
was
thus
made
between
the
king
and
the
sons
of
aymon
the
brothers
came
forth
from
the
castle
bringing
bayard
with
them
and
falling
at
the
king
feet
begged
his
forgiveness
the
king
bade
them
rise
and
received
them
into
favor
in
the
sight
of
all
his
noble
knights
and
counsellors
to
the
great
joy
of
all
especially
of
the
lady
aya
their
mother
then
rinaldo
took
the
horse
bayard
gave
him
to
charlot
and
said
my
lord
and
prince
this
horse
i
give
to
you
do
with
him
as
to
you
seems
good
charlot
took
him
as
had
been
agreed
on
then
he
made
the
servants
take
him
to
the
bridge
and
throw
him
into
the
water
bayard
sank
to
the
bottom
but
soon
came
to
the
surface
again
and
swam
saw
rinaldo
looking
at
him
came
to
land
ran
to
his
old
master
and
stood
by
him
as
proudly
as
if
he
had
understanding
and
would
say
why
did
you
treat
me
so
when
the
prince
saw
that
he
said
rinaldo
give
me
the
horse
again
for
he
must
die
rinaldo
replied
my
lord
and
prince
he
is
yours
without
dispute
and
gave
him
to
him
the
prince
then
had
a
millstone
tied
to
each
foot
and
two
to
his
neck
and
made
them
throw
him
again
into
the
water
bayard
struggled
in
the
water
looked
up
to
his
master
threw
off
the
stones
and
came
back
to
rinaldo
when
alardo
saw
that
he
said
now
must
thou
be
disgraced
forever
brother
if
thou
give
up
the
horse
again
but
rinaldo
answered
brother
be
still
shall
i
for
the
horse
life
provoke
the
anger
of
the
king
again
then
alardo
said
ah
bayard
what
a
return
do
we
make
for
all
thy
true
love
and
service
rinaldo
gave
the
horse
to
the
prince
again
and
said
my
lord
if
the
horse
comes
out
again
i
can
not
return
him
to
you
any
more
for
it
wrings
my
heart
too
much
then
chariot
had
bayard
loaded
with
the
stones
as
before
and
thrown
into
the
water
and
commanded
rinaldo
that
he
should
not
stand
where
the
horse
would
see
him
when
bayard
rose
to
the
surface
he
stretched
his
neck
out
of
the
water
and
looked
round
for
his
master
but
saw
him
not
then
he
sunk
to
the
bottom
rinaldo
was
so
distressed
for
the
loss
of
bayard
that
he
made
a
vow
to
ride
no
horse
again
all
his
life
long
nor
to
bind
a
sword
to
his
side
but
to
become
a
hermit
he
resolved
to
betake
himself
to
some
wild
wood
but
first
to
return
to
his
castle
to
see
his
children
and
to
appoint
to
each
his
share
of
his
estate
so
he
took
leave
of
the
king
and
of
his
brothers
and
returned
to
montalban
and
his
brothers
remained
with
the
king
rinaldo
called
his
children
to
him
and
he
made
his
eldest
born
aymeric
a
knight
and
made
him
lord
of
his
castle
and
of
his
land
he
gave
to
the
rest
what
other
goods
he
had
and
kissed
and
embraced
them
all
commended
them
to
god
and
then
departed
from
them
with
a
heavy
heart
he
had
not
travelled
far
when
he
entered
a
wood
and
there
met
with
a
hermit
who
had
long
been
retired
from
the
world
rinaldo
greeted
him
and
the
hermit
replied
courteously
and
asked
him
who
he
was
and
what
was
his
purpose
rinaldo
replied
sir
i
have
led
a
sinful
life
many
deeds
of
violence
have
i
done
and
many
men
have
i
slain
not
always
in
a
good
cause
but
often
under
the
impulse
of
my
own
headstrong
passions
i
have
also
been
the
cause
of
the
death
of
many
of
my
friends
who
took
my
part
not
because
they
thought
me
in
the
right
but
only
for
love
of
me
and
now
i
come
to
make
confession
of
all
my
sins
and
to
do
penance
for
the
rest
of
my
life
if
perhaps
the
mercy
of
god
will
forgive
me
the
hermit
said
friend
i
perceive
you
have
fallen
into
great
sins
and
have
broken
the
commandments
of
god
but
his
mercy
is
greater
than
your
sins
and
if
you
repent
from
your
heart
and
lead
a
new
life
there
is
yet
hope
for
you
that
he
will
forgive
you
what
is
past
so
rinaldo
was
comforted
and
said
master
i
will
stay
with
you
and
what
you
bid
ane
i
will
do
the
hermit
replied
roots
and
vegetables
will
be
your
food
shirt
or
shoes
you
may
not
wear
your
lot
must
be
poverty
and
want
if
you
stay
with
me
rinaldo
replied
i
will
cheerfully
bear
all
this
and
more
so
he
remained
three
whole
years
with
the
hermit
and
after
that
his
strength
failed
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
like
to
die
one
night
the
hermit
had
a
dream
and
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
which
commanded
him
to
say
to
his
companion
that
he
must
without
delay
go
to
the
holy
land
and
fight
against
the
heathen
the
hermit
when
he
heard
that
voice
was
glad
and
calling
rinaldo
he
said
friend
god
angel
has
commanded
me
to
say
to
you
that
you
must
without
delay
go
to
jerusalem
and
help
our
christians
in
their
struggle
with
the
infidels
then
said
rinaldo
ah
master
how
can
i
do
that
it
is
over
three
years
since
i
made
a
vow
no
more
to
ride
a
horse
nor
take
a
sword
or
spear
in
my
hand
the
hermit
answered
dear
friend
obey
god
and
do
what
the
angel
commanded
i
will
do
so
said
rinaldo
and
pray
for
me
my
master
that
god
may
guide
me
right
then
he
departed
and
went
to
the
seaside
and
took
ship
and
came
to
tripoli
in
syria
and
as
he
went
on
his
way
his
strength
returned
to
him
till
it
was
equal
to
what
it
was
in
his
best
days
and
though
he
never
mounted
a
horse
nor
took
a
sword
in
his
hand
yet
with
his
pilgrim
staff
he
did
good
service
in
the
armies
of
the
christians
and
it
pleased
god
that
he
escaped
unhurt
though
he
was
present
in
many
battles
and
his
courage
inspired
the
men
with
the
same
at
last
a
truce
was
made
with
the
saracens
and
rinaldo
now
old
and
infirm
wishing
to
see
his
native
land
again
before
he
died
took
ship
and
sailed
for
france
when
he
arrived
he
shunned
to
go
to
the
resorts
of
the
great
and
preferred
to
live
among
the
humble
folk
where
he
was
unknown
he
did
country
work
and
lived
on
milk
and
bread
drank
water
and
was
therewith
content
while
he
so
lived
he
heard
that
the
city
of
cologne
was
the
holiest
and
best
of
cities
on
account
of
the
relics
and
bodies
of
saints
who
had
there
poured
out
their
blood
for
the
faith
this
induced
him
to
betake
himself
thither
when
the
pious
hero
arrived
at
cologne
he
went
to
the
monastery
of
peter
and
lived
a
holy
life
occupied
night
and
day
in
devotion
it
so
happened
that
at
that
time
in
the
next
town
to
cologne
there
raged
a
dreadful
pestilence
many
people
came
to
rinaldo
to
beg
him
to
pray
for
them
that
the
plague
might
be
stayed
the
holy
man
prayed
fervently
and
besought
the
lord
to
take
away
the
plague
from
the
people
and
his
prayer
was
heard
the
stroke
of
the
pestilence
was
arrested
and
all
the
people
thanked
the
holy
man
and
praised
god
now
there
was
at
this
time
at
cologne
a
bishop
called
agilolphus
who
was
a
wise
and
understanding
man
who
led
a
pure
and
secluded
life
and
set
a
good
example
to
others
this
bishop
undertook
to
build
the
church
of
peter
and
gave
notice
to
all
stonemasons
and
other
workmen
round
about
to
come
to
cologne
where
they
should
find
work
and
wages
among
others
came
rinaldo
and
he
worked
among
the
laborers
and
did
more
than
four
or
five
common
workmen
when
they
went
to
dinner
he
brought
stone
and
mortar
so
that
they
had
enough
for
the
whole
day
when
the
others
went
to
bed
he
stretched
himself
out
on
the
stones
he
ate
bread
only
and
drank
nothing
but
water
and
had
for
his
wages
but
a
penny
a
day
the
head
workman
asked
him
his
name
and
where
he
belonged
he
would
not
tell
but
said
nothing
and
pursued
his
work
they
called
him
peter
workman
because
he
was
so
devoted
to
his
work
when
the
overseer
saw
the
diligence
of
this
holy
man
he
chid
the
laziness
of
the
other
workmen
and
said
you
receive
more
pay
than
this
good
man
but
do
not
do
half
as
much
work
for
this
reason
the
other
workmen
hated
rinaldo
and
made
a
secret
agreement
to
kill
him
they
knew
that
he
made
it
a
practice
to
go
every
night
to
a
certain
church
to
pray
and
give
alms
so
they
agreed
to
lay
wait
for
him
with
the
purpose
to
kill
him
when
he
came
to
the
spot
they
seized
him
and
beat
him
over
the
head
till
he
was
dead
then
they
put
his
body
into
a
sack
and
stones
with
it
and
cast
it
into
the
rhine
in
the
hope
the
sack
would
sink
to
the
bottom
and
be
there
concealed
but
god
willed
not
that
it
should
be
so
but
caused
the
sack
to
float
on
the
surface
and
be
thrown
upon
the
bank
and
the
soul
of
the
holy
martyr
was
carried
by
angels
with
songs
of
praise
up
to
the
heavens
now
at
that
time
the
people
of
dortmund
had
become
converted
to
the
christian
faith
and
they
sent
to
the
bishop
of
cologne
and
desired
him
to
give
them
some
of
the
holy
relics
that
are
in
such
abundance
in
that
city
so
the
bishop
called
together
his
clergy
to
deliberate
what
answer
they
should
give
to
this
request
and
it
was
determined
to
give
to
the
people
of
dortmund
the
body
of
the
holy
man
who
had
just
suffered
martyrdom
when
now
the
body
with
the
coffin
was
put
on
the
cart
the
cart
began
to
move
toward
dortmund
without
horses
or
help
of
men
and
stopped
not
till
it
reached
the
place
where
the
church
of
rinaldo
now
stands
the
bishop
and
his
clergy
followed
the
holy
man
to
do
him
honor
with
singing
of
hymns
for
a
space
of
three
miles
and
rinaldo
has
ever
since
been
the
patron
of
that
place
and
many
wonderful
works
has
god
done
through
him
as
may
be
seen
in
the
legends
huon
of
bordeaux
when
charlemagne
grew
old
he
felt
the
burden
of
government
become
heavier
year
by
year
till
at
last
he
called
together
his
high
barons
and
peers
to
propose
to
abdicate
the
empire
and
the
throne
of
france
in
favor
of
his
sons
charlot
and
lewis
the
emperor
was
unreasonably
partial
to
his
eldest
son
he
would
have
been
glad
to
have
had
the
barons
and
peers
demand
charlot
for
their
only
sovereign
but
that
prince
was
so
infamous
for
his
falsehood
and
cruelty
that
the
council
strenuously
opposed
the
emperor
proposal
of
abdicating
and
implored
him
to
continue
to
hold
a
sceptre
which
he
wielded
with
so
much
glory
amaury
of
hauteville
cousin
of
ganelon
and
now
head
of
the
wicked
branch
of
the
house
of
maganza
was
the
secret
partisan
of
charlot
whom
he
resembled
in
his
loose
morals
and
bad
dispositions
amaury
nourished
the
most
bitter
resentment
against
the
house
of
guienne
of
which
the
former
duke
sevinus
had
often
rebuked
his
misdeeds
he
took
advantage
of
this
occasion
to
do
an
injury
to
the
two
young
children
whom
the
duke
sevinus
had
left
under
the
charge
of
the
duchess
alice
their
mother
and
at
the
same
time
to
advance
his
interest
with
charlot
by
increasing
his
wealth
and
power
with
this
view
he
suggested
to
the
prince
a
new
idea
he
pretended
to
agree
with
the
opinion
of
the
barons
he
said
that
it
would
be
best
to
try
charlot
capacity
for
government
by
giving
him
some
rich
provinces
before
placing
him
upon
the
throne
and
that
the
emperor
without
depriving
himself
of
any
part
of
his
realm
might
give
charlot
the
investiture
of
guienne
for
although
seven
years
had
passed
since
the
death
of
sevinus
the
young
duke
his
son
had
not
yet
repaired
to
the
court
of
charlemagne
to
render
the
homage
due
to
his
lawful
sovereign
we
have
often
had
occasion
to
admire
the
justice
and
wisdom
of
the
advice
which
on
all
occasions
the
duke
namo
of
bavaria
gave
to
charlemagne
and
he
now
discountenanced
with
indignation
the
selfish
advice
of
amaury
he
represented
to
the
emperor
the
early
age
of
the
children
of
sevinus
and
the
useful
and
glorious
services
of
their
late
father
and
proposed
to
charlemagne
to
send
two
knights
to
the
duchess
at
bordeaux
to
summon
her
two
sons
to
the
court
of
the
emperor
to
pay
their
respects
and
render
homage
charlemagne
approved
this
advice
and
sent
two
chevaliers
to
demand
the
two
young
princes
of
their
mother
no
sooner
had
the
duchess
learned
the
approach
of
the
two
knights
than
she
sent
distinguished
persons
to
receive
them
and
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
palace
she
presented
herself
before
them
with
her
elder
and
younger
sons
huon
and
girard
the
deputies
delighted
with
the
honors
and
caresses
they
received
accompanied
with
rich
presents
left
bordeaux
with
regret
and
on
their
return
represented
to
charlemagne
that
the
young
duke
huon
seemed
born
to
tread
in
the
footsteps
of
his
brave
father
informing
him
that
in
three
months
the
young
princes
of
guienne
would
present
themselves
at
his
court
the
duchess
employed
the
short
interval
in
giving
her
sons
her
last
instructions
huon
received
them
in
his
heart
and
girard
gave
as
much
heed
to
them
as
could
be
expected
from
one
so
young
the
preparations
for
their
departure
having
been
made
the
duchess
embraced
them
tenderly
commending
them
to
the
care
of
heaven
and
charged
them
to
call
on
their
way
at
the
celebrated
monastery
of
cluny
to
visit
the
abbot
the
brother
of
their
father
this
abbot
worthy
of
his
high
dignity
had
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
doing
good
setting
an
example
of
every
excellence
and
making
virtue
attractive
by
his
example
he
received
his
nephews
with
the
greatest
magnificence
and
aware
how
useful
his
presence
might
be
to
them
with
charlemagne
whose
valued
counsellor
he
was
he
took
with
them
the
road
to
paris
when
amaury
learned
what
reception
the
two
deputies
of
charlemagne
had
received
at
bordeaux
and
the
arrangements
made
for
the
visit
of
the
young
princes
to
the
emperor
court
he
suggested
to
charlot
to
give
him
a
troop
of
his
guards
with
which
he
proposed
to
lay
wait
for
the
young
men
in
the
wood
of
montlery
put
them
to
death
and
thereby
give
the
prince
charlot
possession
of
the
duchy
of
guienne
a
plan
of
treachery
and
violence
agreed
but
too
well
with
charlot
disposition
he
not
only
adopted
the
suggestion
of
amaury
but
insisted
upon
taking
a
part
in
it
they
went
out
secretly
by
night
followed
by
a
great
number
of
attendants
all
armed
in
black
to
lie
in
ambuscade
in
the
wood
where
the
brothers
were
to
pass
girard
the
younger
of
the
two
having
amused
himself
as
he
rode
by
flying
his
hawk
at
such
game
as
presented
itself
had
ridden
in
advance
of
his
brother
and
the
abbot
of
cluny
charlot
who
saw
him
coming
alone
and
unarmed
went
forth
to
meet
him
sought
a
quarrel
with
him
and
threw
him
from
his
horse
with
a
stroke
of
his
lance
girard
uttered
a
cry
as
he
fell
huon
heard
it
and
flew
to
his
defence
with
no
other
weapon
than
his
sword
he
came
up
with
him
and
saw
the
blood
flowing
from
his
wound
what
has
this
child
done
to
you
wretch
he
exclaimed
to
charlot
how
cowardly
to
attack
him
when
unprepared
to
defend
himself
by
my
faith
said
charlot
i
mean
to
do
the
same
by
you
know
that
i
am
the
son
of
duke
thierry
of
ardennes
from
whom
your
father
sevinus
took
three
castles
i
have
sworn
to
avenge
him
and
i
defy
you
coward
answered
huon
i
know
well
the
baseness
that
dwells
in
your
race
worthy
son
of
thierry
use
the
advantage
that
your
armor
gives
you
but
know
that
i
fear
you
not
at
these
words
charlot
had
the
wickedness
to
put
his
lance
in
rest
and
to
run
upon
huon
who
had
barely
time
to
wrap
his
arm
in
his
mantle
with
this
feeble
buckler
he
received
the
thrust
of
the
lance
it
penetrated
the
mantle
but
missed
his
body
then
rising
upon
his
stirrups
sir
huon
struck
charlot
so
terrible
a
blow
with
his
sword
that
the
helmet
was
cleft
asunder
and
his
head
too
the
dastardly
prince
fell
dead
upon
the
ground
huon
now
perceived
that
the
wood
was
full
of
armed
men
he
called
the
men
of
his
suite
and
they
hastily
put
themselves
in
order
but
nobody
issued
from
the
wood
to
attack
him
amaury
who
saw
charlot
fall
had
no
desire
to
compromit
himself
and
feeling
sure
that
charlemagne
would
avenge
the
death
of
his
son
he
saw
no
occasion
for
his
doing
anything
more
at
present
he
left
huon
and
the
abbot
of
cluny
to
bind
up
the
wound
of
girard
and
having
seen
them
depart
and
resume
their
way
to
paris
he
took
up
the
body
of
charlot
and
placing
it
across
a
horse
had
it
carried
to
paris
where
he
arrived
four
hours
after
huon
the
abbot
of
cluny
presented
his
nephew
to
charlemagne
but
huon
refrained
from
paying
his
obeisance
complaining
grievously
of
the
ambush
which
had
been
set
for
him
which
he
said
could
not
have
been
without
the
emperor
permission
charlemagne
surprised
at
a
charge
which
his
magnanimous
soul
was
incapable
of
meriting
asked
eagerly
of
the
abbot
what
were
the
grounds
of
the
complaints
of
his
nephew
the
abbot
told
him
faithfully
all
that
had
happened
informing
him
that
a
coward
knight
who
called
himself
the
son
of
thierry
of
ardennes
had
wounded
girard
and
run
upon
huon
who
was
unarmed
but
by
his
force
and
valor
he
had
overcome
the
traitor
and
left
him
dead
upon
the
plain
charlemagne
indignantly
disavowed
any
connection
with
the
action
of
the
infamous
thierry
congratulated
the
young
duke
upon
his
victory
himself
conducted
the
two
brothers
to
a
rich
apartment
stayed
to
see
the
first
dressing
applied
to
the
wound
of
girard
and
left
the
brothers
in
charge
of
duke
namo
of
bavaria
who
having
been
a
companion
in
arms
of
the
duke
sevinus
regarded
the
young
men
almost
as
if
they
were
his
own
sons
charlemagne
had
hardly
quitted
them
when
returning
to
his
chamber
he
heard
cries
and
saw
through
the
window
a
party
of
armed
men
just
arrived
he
recognized
amaury
who
bore
a
dead
knight
stretched
across
a
horse
and
the
name
of
charlot
was
heard
among
the
exclamations
of
the
people
assembled
in
the
charles
partiality
for
this
unworthy
son
was
one
of
his
weaknesses
he
descended
in
trepidation
to
the
ran
to
amaury
and
uttered
a
cry
of
grief
on
recognizing
charlot
it
is
huon
of
bordeaux
said
the
traitor
amaury
who
has
massacred
your
son
before
it
was
in
my
power
to
defend
him
charlemagne
furious
at
these
words
seized
a
sword
and
flew
to
the
apartment
of
the
two
brothers
to
plunge
it
into
the
heart
of
the
murderer
of
his
son
duke
namo
stopped
his
hand
for
an
instant
while
charles
told
him
the
crime
of
which
huon
was
accused
he
is
a
peer
of
the
realm
said
namo
and
if
he
is
guilty
is
he
not
here
in
your
power
and
are
not
we
peers
the
proper
judges
to
condemn
him
to
death
let
not
your
hand
be
stained
with
his
blood
the
emperor
calmed
by
the
wisdom
of
duke
namo
summoned
amaury
to
his
presence
the
peers
assembled
to
hear
his
testimony
and
the
traitor
accused
huon
of
bordeaux
of
having
struck
the
fatal
blow
without
allowing
charlot
an
opportunity
to
defend
himself
and
though
he
knew
that
his
opponent
was
the
emperor
eldest
son
the
abbot
of
cluny
indignant
at
the
false
accusation
of
amaury
advanced
and
said
by
saint
benedict
sire
the
traitor
lies
in
his
throat
if
my
nephew
has
slain
charlot
it
was
in
his
own
defence
and
after
having
seen
his
brother
wounded
by
him
and
also
in
ignorance
that
his
adversary
was
the
prince
though
i
am
a
son
of
the
church
added
the
good
abbot
i
forget
not
that
i
am
a
knight
by
birth
i
offer
to
prove
with
my
body
the
lie
upon
amaury
if
he
dares
sustain
it
and
i
shall
feel
that
i
am
doing
a
better
work
to
punish
a
disloyal
traitor
than
to
sing
lauds
and
matins
huon
to
this
time
had
kept
silent
amazed
at
the
black
calumny
of
amaury
but
now
he
stepped
forth
and
addressing
amaury
said
traitor
darest
thou
maintain
in
arms
the
lie
thou
hast
uttered
amaury
a
knight
of
great
prowess
despising
the
youth
and
slight
figure
of
huon
hesitated
not
to
offer
his
glove
which
huon
seized
then
turning
again
to
the
peers
he
said
i
pray
you
let
the
combat
be
allowed
me
for
never
was
there
a
more
legitimate
cause
the
duke
namo
and
the
rest
deciding
that
the
question
should
be
remitted
to
the
judgment
of
heaven
the
combat
was
ordained
to
which
charlemagne
unwillingly
consented
the
young
duke
was
restored
to
the
charge
of
duke
namo
who
the
next
morning
invested
him
with
the
honors
of
knighthood
and
gave
him
armor
of
proof
with
a
white
shield
the
abbot
of
cluny
delighted
to
find
in
his
nephew
sentiments
worthy
of
his
birth
embraced
him
gave
him
his
blessing
and
hastened
to
the
church
of
germains
to
pray
for
him
while
the
officers
of
the
king
prepared
the
lists
for
the
combat
the
battle
was
long
and
obstinate
the
address
and
agility
of
huon
enabled
him
to
avoid
the
terrible
blows
which
the
ferocious
amaury
aimed
at
him
but
huon
had
more
than
once
drawn
blood
from
his
antagonist
the
effect
began
to
be
perceived
in
the
failing
strength
of
the
traitor
at
last
he
threw
himself
from
his
horse
and
kneeling
begged
for
mercy
spare
me
he
said
and
i
will
confess
all
aid
me
to
rise
and
lead
me
to
charlemagne
the
brave
and
loyal
huon
at
these
words
put
his
sword
under
his
left
arm
and
stretched
out
his
right
to
raise
the
prostrate
man
who
seized
the
opportunity
to
give
him
a
thrust
in
the
side
the
hauberk
of
huon
resisted
the
blow
and
he
was
wounded
but
slightly
transported
with
rage
at
this
act
of
baseness
he
forgot
how
necessary
for
his
complete
acquittal
the
confession
of
amaury
was
and
without
delay
dealt
him
the
fatal
blow
duke
namo
and
the
other
peers
approached
had
the
body
of
amaury
dragged
forth
from
the
lists
and
conducted
huon
to
charlemagne
the
emperor
however
listening
to
nothing
but
his
resentment
and
grief
for
the
death
of
his
son
refused
to
be
satisfied
and
under
the
plea
that
huon
had
not
succeeded
in
making
his
accuser
retract
his
charge
seemed
resolved
to
confiscate
his
estates
and
to
banish
him
forever
from
france
it
was
not
till
after
long
entreaties
on
the
part
of
duke
namo
and
the
rest
that
he
consented
to
grant
huon
his
pardon
under
conditions
which
he
should
impose
huon
approached
and
knelt
before
the
emperor
rendered
his
homage
and
cried
him
mercy
for
the
involuntary
killing
of
his
son
charlemagne
would
not
receive
the
hands
of
huon
in
his
own
but
touched
him
with
his
sceptre
saying
i
receive
thy
homage
and
pardon
thee
the
death
of
my
son
but
only
on
one
condition
you
shall
go
immediately
to
the
court
of
the
sultan
gaudisso
you
shall
present
yourself
before
him
as
he
sits
at
meat
you
shall
cut
off
the
head
of
the
most
illustrious
guest
whom
you
shall
find
sitting
nearest
to
him
you
shall
kiss
three
times
on
the
mouth
the
fair
princess
his
daughter
and
you
shall
demand
of
the
sultan
as
token
of
tribute
to
me
a
handful
of
the
white
hair
of
his
beard
and
four
grinders
from
his
mouth
these
conditions
caused
a
murmur
from
all
the
assembly
what
said
the
abbot
of
cluny
slaughter
a
saracen
prince
without
first
offering
him
baptism
the
second
condition
is
not
so
hard
said
the
young
peers
but
the
demand
that
huon
is
bound
to
make
of
the
old
sultan
is
very
uncivil
and
will
be
hard
to
obtain
the
emperor
obstinacy
when
he
had
once
resolved
upon
a
thing
is
well
known
to
the
courage
of
huon
nothing
seemed
impossible
i
accept
the
conditions
said
he
silencing
the
intercessions
of
the
old
duke
of
bavaria
my
liege
i
accept
my
pardon
at
this
price
i
go
to
execute
your
commands
as
your
vassal
and
a
peer
of
france
the
duke
namo
and
abbot
of
cluny
being
unable
to
obtain
any
relaxation
of
the
sentence
passed
by
charlemagne
led
forth
the
young
duke
who
determined
to
set
out
at
once
on
his
expedition
all
that
the
good
abbot
could
obtain
of
him
was
that
he
should
prepare
for
this
perilous
undertaking
by
going
first
to
rome
to
pay
his
homage
to
the
pope
who
was
the
brother
of
the
duchess
alice
huon
mother
and
from
him
demand
absolution
and
his
blessing
huon
promised
it
and
forthwith
set
out
on
his
way
to
rome
huon
of
bordeaux
continued
huon
having
traversed
the
apennines
and
italy
arrived
at
the
environs
of
rome
where
laying
aside
his
armor
he
assumed
the
dress
of
a
pilgrim
in
this
attire
he
presented
himself
before
the
pope
and
not
till
after
he
had
made
a
full
confession
of
his
sins
did
he
announce
himself
as
his
nephew
ah
my
dear
nephew
exclaimed
the
holy
father
what
harder
penance
could
i
impose
than
the
emperor
has
already
done
go
in
peace
my
son
he
added
absolving
him
i
go
to
intercede
for
you
with
the
most
high
then
he
led
his
nephew
into
his
palace
and
introduced
him
to
all
the
cardinals
and
princes
of
rome
as
the
duke
of
guienne
son
of
the
duchess
alice
his
sister
huon
at
setting
out
had
made
a
vow
not
to
stop
more
than
three
days
in
a
place
the
holy
father
took
advantage
of
this
time
to
inspire
him
with
zeal
for
the
glory
of
christianity
and
with
confidence
in
the
protection
of
the
most
high
he
advised
him
to
embark
for
palestine
to
visit
the
holy
sepulchre
and
to
depart
thence
for
the
interior
of
asia
loaded
with
the
blessings
of
the
holy
father
huon
obeying
his
counsels
embarked
for
palestine
arrived
and
visited
with
the
greatest
reverence
the
holy
places
he
then
departed
and
took
his
way
toward
the
east
but
ignorant
of
the
country
and
of
the
language
he
lost
himself
in
a
forest
and
remained
three
days
without
seeing
a
human
creature
living
on
honey
and
wild
fruits
which
he
found
on
the
trees
the
third
day
seeking
a
passage
through
a
rocky
defile
he
beheld
a
man
in
tattered
clothing
whose
beard
and
hair
covered
his
breast
and
shoulders
this
man
stopped
on
seeing
him
observed
him
and
recognized
the
arms
and
bearing
of
a
french
knight
he
immediately
approached
and
exclaimed
in
the
language
of
the
south
of
france
god
be
praised
do
i
indeed
behold
a
chevalier
of
my
own
country
after
fifteen
years
passed
in
this
desert
without
seeing
the
face
of
a
huon
to
gratify
him
still
more
unlaced
his
helmet
and
came
towards
him
with
a
smiling
countenance
the
other
regarded
him
with
more
surprise
than
at
first
good
heaven
he
exclaimed
was
there
ever
such
a
resemblance
ah
noble
sir
he
added
tell
me
i
beseech
you
of
what
country
and
race
you
come
i
require
replied
huon
before
telling
you
mine
that
you
first
reveal
your
own
let
it
suffice
you
at
present
to
know
that
i
am
a
christian
and
that
in
guienne
i
was
born
ah
heaven
grant
that
my
eyes
and
my
heart
do
not
deceive
me
exclaimed
the
unknown
my
name
is
sherasmin
i
am
brother
to
guire
the
mayor
of
bordeaux
i
was
taken
prisoner
in
the
battle
where
my
dear
and
illustrious
master
sevinus
lost
his
life
for
three
years
i
endured
the
miseries
of
slavery
at
length
i
broke
my
chains
and
escaped
to
this
desert
where
i
have
sustained
myself
in
solitude
ever
since
your
features
recall
to
me
my
beloved
sovereign
in
whose
service
i
was
from
my
infancy
till
his
death
huon
made
no
reply
but
by
embracing
the
old
man
with
tears
in
his
eyes
then
sherasmin
learned
that
his
arms
enfolded
the
son
of
the
duke
sevinus
he
led
him
to
his
cabin
and
spread
before
him
the
dry
fruits
and
honey
which
formed
his
only
aliment
huon
recounted
his
adventures
to
sherasmin
who
was
moved
to
tears
at
the
recital
he
then
consulted
him
on
means
of
conducting
his
enterprise
sherasmin
hesitated
not
to
confess
that
success
seemed
impossible
nevertheless
he
swore
a
solemn
oath
never
to
abandon
him
the
saracen
language
which
he
was
master
of
would
be
serviceable
to
them
when
they
should
leave
the
desert
and
mingle
with
men
they
took
the
route
of
the
red
sea
and
entered
arabia
their
way
lay
through
a
region
which
sherasmin
described
as
full
of
terrors
it
was
inhabited
by
oberon
king
of
the
fairies
who
made
captive
such
knights
as
were
rash
enough
to
penetrate
into
it
and
transformed
them
into
hobgoblins
it
was
possible
to
avoid
this
district
at
the
expense
of
somewhat
lengthening
their
route
but
no
dangers
could
deter
huon
of
bordeaux
and
the
brave
sherasmin
who
had
now
resumed
the
armor
of
a
knight
reluctantly
consented
to
share
with
him
the
dangers
of
the
shorter
route
they
entered
a
wood
and
arrived
at
a
spot
whence
alleys
branched
off
in
various
directions
one
of
them
seemed
to
be
terminated
by
a
superb
palace
whose
gilded
roofs
were
adorned
with
brilliant
weathercocks
covered
with
diamonds
a
superb
chariot
issued
from
the
gate
of
the
palace
and
drove
toward
huon
and
his
companion
as
if
to
meet
them
the
prince
saw
no
one
in
the
chariot
but
a
child
apparently
about
five
years
old
very
beautiful
and
clad
in
a
robe
which
glittered
with
precious
stones
at
the
sight
of
him
sherasmin
terror
was
extreme
he
seized
the
reins
of
huon
horse
and
turned
him
about
hurrying
the
prince
away
and
assuring
him
that
they
were
lost
if
they
stopped
to
parley
with
the
mischievous
dwarf
who
though
he
appeared
a
child
was
full
of
years
and
of
treachery
huon
was
sorry
to
lose
sight
of
the
beautiful
dwarf
whose
aspect
had
nothing
in
it
to
alarm
yet
he
followed
his
friend
who
urged
on
his
horse
with
all
possible
speed
presently
a
storm
began
to
roar
through
the
forest
the
daylight
grew
dim
and
they
found
their
way
with
difficulty
from
time
to
time
they
seemed
to
hear
an
infantine
voice
which
said
stop
duke
huon
listen
to
me
it
is
in
vain
you
fly
me
sherasmin
only
fled
the
faster
and
stopped
not
until
he
had
reached
the
gate
of
a
monastery
of
monks
and
nuns
the
two
communities
of
which
were
assembled
at
that
time
in
a
religious
procession
sherasmin
feeling
safe
from
the
malice
of
the
dwarf
in
the
presence
of
so
many
holy
persons
and
the
sacred
banners
stopped
to
ask
an
asylum
and
made
huon
dismount
also
but
at
that
moment
they
were
joined
by
the
dwarf
who
blew
a
blast
upon
an
ivory
horn
which
hung
from
his
neck
immediately
the
good
sherasmin
in
spite
of
himself
began
to
dance
like
a
young
collegian
and
seizing
the
hand
of
an
aged
nun
who
felt
as
if
it
would
be
her
death
they
footed
it
briskly
over
the
grass
and
were
imitated
by
all
the
other
monks
and
nuns
mingled
together
forming
the
strangest
ever
beheld
huron
alone
felt
no
disposition
to
dance
but
he
came
near
dying
of
laughter
at
seeing
the
ridiculous
postures
and
leaps
of
the
others
the
dwarf
approaching
huon
said
in
a
sweet
voice
and
in
own
language
duke
of
guienne
why
do
you
shun
me
i
conjure
you
in
heaven
name
speak
to
me
huon
hearing
himself
addressed
in
this
serious
manner
and
knowing
that
no
evil
spirit
would
dare
to
use
the
holy
name
in
aid
of
his
schemes
replied
sir
whoever
you
are
i
am
ready
to
hear
and
answer
you
huon
my
friend
continued
the
dwarf
i
always
loved
your
race
and
you
have
been
dear
to
me
ever
since
your
birth
the
gracious
state
of
conscience
in
which
you
were
when
you
entered
my
wood
has
protected
you
from
all
enchantments
even
if
i
had
intended
to
practise
any
upon
you
if
these
monks
these
nuns
and
even
your
friend
sherasmin
had
had
a
conscience
as
pure
as
yours
my
horn
would
not
have
set
them
dancing
but
where
is
the
monk
or
the
nun
who
can
always
be
deaf
to
the
voice
of
the
tempter
and
sherasmin
in
the
desert
has
often
doubted
the
power
of
providence
at
these
words
huon
saw
the
dancers
overcome
with
exertion
he
begged
mercy
for
them
the
dwarf
granted
it
and
the
effect
of
the
horn
ceased
at
once
the
nuns
got
rid
of
their
partners
smoothed
their
dresses
and
hastened
to
resume
their
places
in
the
procession
sherasmin
overcome
with
heat
panting
and
unable
to
stand
on
his
legs
threw
himself
upon
the
grass
and
began
did
not
i
tell
you
he
was
going
on
in
an
angry
tone
but
the
dwarf
approaching
said
sherasmin
why
have
you
murmured
against
providence
why
have
you
thought
evil
of
me
you
deserved
this
light
punishment
but
i
know
you
to
be
good
and
loyal
i
mean
to
show
myself
your
friend
as
you
shall
soon
see
at
these
words
he
presented
him
a
rich
goblet
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
this
cup
said
he
and
then
believe
that
i
hold
my
power
from
the
god
you
adore
whose
faithful
servant
i
am
as
well
as
you
sherasmin
obeyed
and
on
the
instant
the
cup
was
filled
with
delicious
wine
a
draught
of
which
restored
vigor
to
his
limbs
and
made
him
feel
young
again
overcome
with
gratitude
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
but
the
dwarf
raised
him
and
bade
him
sit
beside
him
and
thus
commenced
his
history
julius
caesar
going
by
sea
to
join
his
army
was
driven
by
a
storm
to
take
shelter
in
the
island
of
celea
where
dwelt
the
fairy
glorianda
from
this
renowned
pair
i
draw
my
birth
i
am
the
inheritor
of
that
which
was
most
admirable
in
each
of
my
parents
my
father
heroic
qualities
and
my
mother
beauty
and
magic
art
but
a
malicious
sister
of
my
mother
in
revenge
for
some
slight
offence
touched
me
with
her
wand
when
i
was
only
five
years
old
and
forbade
me
to
grow
any
bigger
and
my
mother
with
all
her
power
was
unable
to
annul
the
sentence
i
have
thus
continued
infantile
in
appearance
though
full
of
years
and
experience
the
power
which
i
derive
from
my
mother
i
use
sometimes
for
my
own
diversion
but
always
to
promote
justice
and
to
reward
virtue
i
am
able
and
willing
to
assist
you
duke
of
guienne
for
i
know
the
errand
on
which
you
come
hither
i
presage
for
you
if
you
follow
my
counsels
complete
success
and
the
beautiful
clarimunda
for
a
wife
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
presented
to
huon
the
precious
and
useful
cup
which
had
the
faculty
of
filling
itself
when
a
good
man
took
it
in
his
hand
he
gave
him
also
his
beautiful
horn
of
ivory
saying
to
him
huon
when
you
sound
this
gently
you
will
make
the
hearers
dance
as
you
have
seen
but
if
you
sound
it
forcibly
fear
not
that
i
shall
hear
it
though
at
a
hundred
leagues
distance
and
will
fly
to
your
relief
but
be
careful
not
to
sound
it
in
that
way
unless
upon
the
most
urgent
occasion
oberon
directed
huon
what
course
he
should
take
to
reach
the
country
of
the
sultan
gaudisso
you
will
encounter
great
perils
said
he
before
arriving
there
and
i
fear
me
he
added
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
you
will
not
in
everything
obey
my
directions
and
in
that
case
you
will
suffer
much
calamity
then
he
embraced
huon
and
sherasmin
and
left
them
huon
and
his
follower
travelled
many
days
through
the
desert
before
they
reached
any
inhabited
place
and
all
this
while
the
wonderful
cup
sustained
them
furnishing
them
not
only
wine
but
food
also
at
last
they
came
to
a
great
city
as
day
was
declining
they
entered
its
suburbs
and
sherasmin
who
spoke
the
saracen
language
perfectly
inquired
for
an
inn
where
they
could
pass
the
night
a
person
who
appeared
to
be
one
of
the
principal
inhabitants
seeing
two
strangers
of
respectable
appearance
making
this
inquiry
stepped
forward
and
begged
them
to
accept
the
shelter
of
his
mansion
they
entered
and
their
host
did
the
honors
of
his
abode
with
a
politeness
which
they
were
astonished
to
see
in
a
saracen
he
had
them
served
with
coffee
and
sherbet
and
all
was
conducted
with
great
decorum
till
one
of
the
servants
awkwardly
overturned
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
on
the
host
legs
when
he
started
up
exclaiming
in
very
good
gascon
blood
and
thunder
you
blockhead
you
deserve
to
be
thrown
over
the
mosque
huon
could
not
help
laughing
to
see
the
vivacity
and
the
language
of
his
country
thus
break
out
unawares
the
host
who
had
no
idea
that
his
guests
understood
his
words
was
astonished
when
huon
addressed
him
in
the
dialect
of
his
country
immediately
confidence
was
established
between
them
especially
when
the
domestics
had
retired
the
host
seeing
that
he
was
discovered
and
that
the
two
pretended
saracens
were
from
the
borders
of
the
garonne
embraced
them
and
disclosed
that
he
was
a
christian
huon
who
had
learned
prudence
from
the
advice
of
oberon
to
test
his
host
sincerity
drew
from
his
robe
the
cup
which
the
king
had
given
him
and
presented
it
empty
to
the
host
a
fair
cup
said
he
but
i
should
like
it
better
if
it
was
full
immediately
it
was
so
the
host
astonished
dared
not
put
it
to
his
lips
drink
boldly
my
dear
said
huon
your
truth
is
proved
by
this
cup
which
only
fills
itself
in
the
hands
of
an
honest
man
the
host
did
not
hesitate
longer
the
cup
passed
freely
from
hand
to
hand
their
mutual
cordiality
increased
as
it
passed
and
each
recounted
his
adventures
those
of
huon
redoubled
his
host
respect
for
he
recognized
in
him
his
legitimate
sovereign
while
the
host
narrative
was
in
these
words
my
name
is
floriac
this
great
and
strong
city
you
will
hear
with
surprise
and
grief
is
governed
by
a
brother
of
duke
sevinus
and
your
uncle
you
have
no
doubt
heard
that
a
young
brother
of
the
duke
of
guienne
was
stolen
away
from
the
with
his
companions
by
some
corsairs
i
was
then
his
page
and
we
were
carried
by
those
corsairs
to
barbary
where
we
were
sold
for
slaves
the
barbary
prince
sent
us
as
part
of
the
tribute
which
he
yearly
paid
to
his
sovereign
the
sultan
gaudisso
your
uncle
who
had
been
somewhat
puffed
up
by
the
flattery
of
his
attendants
thought
to
increase
his
importance
with
his
new
master
by
telling
him
his
rank
the
sultan
who
like
a
true
mussulman
detested
all
christian
princes
exerted
himself
from
that
moment
to
bring
him
over
to
the
saracen
faith
he
succeeded
but
too
well
your
uncle
seduced
by
the
arts
of
the
santons
and
by
the
pleasures
and
indulgences
which
the
sultan
allowed
him
committed
the
horrid
crime
of
apostasy
he
renounced
his
baptism
and
embraced
mahometanism
gaudisso
then
loaded
him
with
honors
made
him
espouse
one
of
his
nieces
and
sent
him
to
reign
over
this
city
and
adjoining
country
your
uncle
preserved
for
me
the
same
friendship
which
he
had
had
when
a
boy
but
all
his
caresses
and
efforts
could
not
make
me
renounce
my
faith
perhaps
he
respected
me
in
his
heart
for
my
resistance
to
his
persuasions
perhaps
he
had
hopes
of
inducing
me
in
time
to
imitate
him
he
made
me
accompany
him
to
this
city
of
which
he
was
master
he
gave
me
his
confidence
and
permits
me
to
keep
in
my
service
some
christians
whom
i
protect
for
the
sake
of
their
faith
ah
exclaimed
huon
take
me
to
this
guilty
uncle
a
prince
of
the
house
of
guienne
must
he
not
blush
at
the
cowardly
abandonment
of
the
faith
of
his
fathers
alas
replied
floriac
i
fear
he
will
neither
be
sensible
of
shame
at
your
reproaches
nor
of
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
a
nephew
so
worthy
of
his
lineage
brutified
by
sensuality
jealous
of
his
power
which
he
often
exercises
with
cruelty
he
will
more
probably
restrain
you
by
force
or
put
you
to
death
be
it
so
said
the
brave
and
fervent
huon
i
could
not
die
in
a
better
cause
and
i
demand
of
you
to
conduct
me
to
him
after
having
told
him
of
my
arrival
and
my
birth
floriac
still
objected
but
huon
would
take
no
denial
and
he
promised
obedience
next
morning
floriac
waited
upon
the
governor
and
told
him
of
the
arrival
of
his
nephew
huon
of
bordeaux
and
of
the
intention
of
the
prince
to
present
himself
at
his
court
that
very
day
the
governor
surprised
did
not
immediately
answer
though
he
at
once
made
up
his
mind
what
to
do
he
knew
that
floriac
loved
christians
and
the
princes
of
his
native
land
too
well
to
aid
in
any
treason
to
one
of
them
he
therefore
feigned
great
pleasure
at
hearing
of
the
arrival
of
the
eldest
born
of
his
family
at
his
court
he
immediately
sent
floriac
to
find
him
he
caused
his
palace
to
be
put
in
festal
array
his
divan
to
be
assembled
and
after
giving
some
secret
orders
went
himself
to
meet
his
nephew
whom
he
introduced
under
his
proper
name
and
title
to
all
the
great
officers
of
his
court
huon
burned
with
indignation
at
seeing
his
uncle
with
forehead
encircled
with
a
rich
turban
surmounted
with
a
crescent
of
precious
stones
his
natural
candor
made
him
receive
with
pain
the
embraces
which
the
treacherous
governor
lavished
upon
him
meanwhile
the
hope
of
finding
a
suitable
moment
to
reproach
him
for
his
apostasy
made
him
submit
to
those
honors
which
his
uncle
caused
to
be
rendered
to
him
the
governor
evaded
with
address
the
chance
of
being
alone
with
huon
and
spent
all
the
morning
in
taking
him
through
his
gardens
and
palace
at
last
when
the
hour
of
dinner
approached
and
the
governor
took
him
by
the
hand
to
lead
him
into
the
huon
seized
the
opportunity
and
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
o
my
uncle
o
prince
brother
of
the
duke
sevinus
in
what
condition
have
i
the
grief
and
shame
of
seeing
you
the
governor
pretended
to
be
moved
pressed
his
hand
and
whispered
in
his
ear
silence
my
dear
nephew
morning
i
will
hear
you
fully
huon
comforted
a
little
by
these
words
took
his
seat
at
the
table
by
the
side
of
the
governor
the
mufti
some
cadis
agas
and
santons
filled
the
other
places
sherasmin
sat
down
with
them
but
floriac
who
would
not
lose
sight
of
his
guests
remained
standing
and
passed
in
and
out
to
observe
what
was
going
on
within
the
palace
he
soon
perceived
a
number
of
armed
men
gliding
through
the
passages
and
antechambers
connected
with
the
he
was
about
to
enter
to
give
his
guests
notice
of
what
he
had
seen
when
he
heard
a
violent
noise
and
commotion
in
the
hall
the
cause
was
this
huon
and
sherasmin
were
well
enough
suited
with
the
first
course
and
ate
with
good
appetite
but
the
people
of
their
country
not
being
accustomed
to
drink
only
water
at
their
meals
huon
and
sherasmin
looked
at
one
another
not
very
well
pleased
at
such
a
regimen
huon
laughed
outright
at
the
impatience
of
sherasmin
but
soon
experiencing
the
same
want
himself
he
drew
forth
cup
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
the
cup
filled
and
he
drank
it
off
and
handed
it
to
sherasmin
who
followed
his
example
the
governor
and
his
officers
seeing
this
abhorred
sign
contracted
their
brows
and
sat
in
silent
consternation
huon
pretended
not
to
observe
it
and
having
filled
the
cup
again
handed
it
to
his
uncle
saying
pray
join
us
dear
uncle
it
is
excellent
bordeaux
wine
the
drink
that
will
be
to
you
like
mother
milk
the
governor
who
often
drank
in
secret
with
his
own
favorite
sultanas
the
wines
of
greece
and
shiraz
never
in
public
drank
anything
but
water
he
had
not
for
a
long
time
tasted
the
excellent
wines
of
his
native
land
he
was
sorely
tempted
to
drink
what
was
now
handed
to
him
it
looked
so
bright
in
the
cup
outshining
the
gold
itself
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
took
the
brimming
goblet
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
when
immediately
it
dried
up
and
disappeared
huon
and
sherasmin
like
gascons
as
they
were
laughed
at
his
astonishment
christian
dogs
he
exclaimed
do
you
dare
to
insult
me
at
my
own
table
but
i
will
soon
be
revenged
at
these
words
he
threw
the
cup
at
the
head
of
his
nephew
who
caught
it
with
his
left
hand
while
with
the
other
he
snatched
the
turban
with
its
crescent
from
the
governor
head
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
all
the
saracens
started
up
from
table
with
loud
outcries
and
prepared
to
avenge
the
insult
huon
and
sherasmin
put
themselves
on
their
defence
and
met
with
their
swords
the
scimitars
directed
against
them
at
this
moment
the
doors
of
the
hall
opened
and
a
crowd
of
soldiers
and
armed
eunuchs
rushed
in
who
joined
in
the
attack
upon
huon
and
sherasmin
the
prince
and
his
followers
took
refuge
on
a
broad
shelf
or
board
where
they
kept
at
bay
the
crowd
of
assailants
making
the
most
forward
of
them
smart
for
their
audacity
but
more
troops
came
pressing
in
and
the
brave
huon
inspired
by
the
wine
of
bordeaux
and
not
angry
enough
to
lose
his
relish
for
a
joke
blew
a
gentle
note
on
his
horn
and
no
sooner
was
it
heard
than
it
quelled
the
rage
of
the
combatants
and
set
them
to
dancing
huon
and
sherasmin
no
longer
attacked
looked
down
from
their
elevated
position
on
a
scene
the
most
singular
and
amusing
very
soon
the
sultanas
hearing
the
sound
of
the
dance
and
finding
their
guards
withdrawn
came
into
the
hall
and
mixed
with
the
dancers
the
favorite
sultana
seized
upon
a
young
santon
who
performed
jumps
two
feet
high
but
soon
the
long
dresses
of
this
couple
got
intermingled
and
threw
them
down
the
santon
beard
was
caught
in
the
sultana
necklace
and
they
could
not
disentangle
them
the
governor
by
no
means
approved
this
familiarity
and
took
two
steps
forward
to
get
at
the
santon
but
he
stumbled
over
a
prostrate
dervise
and
measured
his
length
on
the
floor
the
dancing
continued
till
the
strength
of
the
performers
was
exhausted
and
they
fell
one
after
the
other
and
lay
helpless
the
governor
at
length
made
signs
to
huon
that
he
would
yield
everything
if
he
would
but
allow
him
to
rest
the
bargain
was
ratified
the
governor
allowed
huon
and
sherasmin
to
depart
on
their
way
and
even
gave
them
a
ring
which
would
procure
them
safe
passage
through
his
country
and
access
to
the
sultan
gaudisso
the
two
friends
hastened
to
avail
themselves
of
this
favorable
turn
and
taking
leave
of
floriac
pursued
their
journey
huon
of
bordeaux
continued
huon
had
seen
many
beauties
at
his
mother
court
but
his
heart
had
never
been
touched
with
love
honor
had
been
his
mistress
and
in
pursuit
of
that
he
had
never
found
time
to
give
a
thought
to
softer
cares
strange
that
a
heart
so
insensible
should
first
be
touched
by
something
so
unsubstantial
as
a
dream
but
so
it
was
the
day
after
the
adventure
with
his
uncle
night
overtook
the
travellers
as
they
passed
through
a
forest
a
grotto
offered
them
shelter
from
the
night
dews
the
magic
cup
supplied
their
evening
meal
for
such
was
its
virtue
that
it
afforded
not
only
wine
but
more
solid
fare
when
desired
fatigue
soon
threw
them
into
profound
repose
lulled
by
the
murmur
of
the
foliage
and
breathing
the
fragrance
of
the
flowers
huon
dreamed
that
a
lady
more
beautiful
than
he
had
ever
before
seen
hung
over
him
and
imprinted
a
kiss
upon
his
lips
as
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
embrace
her
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
swept
her
away
huon
awoke
in
an
agony
of
regret
a
few
moments
sufficed
to
afford
some
consolation
in
showing
him
that
what
had
passed
was
but
a
dream
but
his
perplexity
and
sadness
could
not
escape
the
notice
of
sherasmin
huon
hesitated
not
to
inform
his
faithful
follower
of
the
reason
of
his
pensiveness
and
got
nothing
in
return
but
his
rallyings
for
allowing
himself
to
be
disturbed
by
such
a
cause
he
recommended
a
draught
from
the
fairy
goblet
and
huon
tried
it
with
good
effect
at
early
dawn
they
resumed
their
way
they
travelled
till
high
noon
but
said
little
to
one
another
huon
was
musing
on
his
dream
and
sherasmin
thoughts
flew
back
to
his
early
days
on
the
banks
of
the
flowery
garonne
on
a
sudden
they
were
startled
by
the
cry
of
distress
and
turning
an
angle
of
the
wood
came
where
a
knight
hard
pressed
was
fighting
with
a
furious
lion
the
knight
horse
lay
dead
and
it
seemed
as
if
another
moment
would
end
the
combat
for
terror
and
fatigue
had
quite
disabled
the
knight
for
further
resistance
he
fell
and
the
lion
paw
was
raised
over
him
when
a
blow
from
huon
sword
turned
the
monster
rage
upon
a
new
enemy
his
roar
shook
the
forest
and
he
crouched
in
act
to
spring
when
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
huon
plunged
his
sword
into
his
side
he
rolled
over
on
the
plain
in
the
agonies
of
death
they
raised
the
knight
from
the
ground
and
sherasmin
hastened
to
offer
him
a
draught
from
the
fairy
cup
the
wine
sparkled
to
the
brim
and
the
warrior
put
forth
his
lips
to
quaff
it
but
it
shrunk
away
and
did
not
even
wet
his
lips
he
dashed
the
goblet
angrily
on
the
ground
with
an
exclamation
of
resentment
this
incident
did
not
tend
to
make
either
party
more
acceptable
to
the
other
and
what
followed
was
worse
for
when
huon
said
sir
knight
thank
god
for
your
deliverance
thank
mahomet
rather
yourself
said
he
for
he
has
led
you
this
day
to
render
service
to
no
less
a
personage
than
the
prince
of
hyrcania
at
the
sound
of
this
blasphemy
huon
drew
his
sword
and
turned
upon
the
miscreant
who
little
disposed
to
encounter
the
prowess
of
which
he
had
so
lately
seen
proof
betook
himself
to
flight
he
ran
to
huon
horse
and
lightly
vaulting
on
his
back
clapped
spurs
to
his
side
and
galloped
out
of
sight
the
adventure
was
vexatious
yet
there
was
no
remedy
the
prince
and
sherasmin
continued
their
journey
with
the
aid
of
the
remaining
horse
as
they
best
might
at
length
as
evening
set
in
they
descried
the
pinnacles
and
towers
of
a
great
city
full
before
them
which
they
knew
to
be
the
famous
city
of
bagdad
they
were
exhausted
with
fatigue
when
they
arrived
at
its
precincts
and
in
the
darkness
not
knowing
what
course
to
take
were
glad
to
meet
an
aged
woman
who
in
reply
to
their
inquiries
offered
them
such
accommodations
as
her
cottage
could
supply
they
thankfully
accepted
the
offer
and
entered
the
low
door
the
good
dame
busily
prepared
the
best
fare
her
stores
supplied
milk
figs
and
peaches
deeply
regretting
that
the
bleak
winds
had
nipped
her
sir
huon
thought
he
had
never
in
his
life
tasted
any
fare
so
good
the
old
lady
talked
while
her
guests
ate
she
doubted
not
she
said
they
had
come
to
be
present
at
the
great
feast
in
honor
of
the
marriage
of
the
sultan
daughter
which
was
to
take
place
on
the
morrow
they
asked
who
the
bridegroom
was
to
be
and
the
old
lady
answered
the
prince
of
hyrcania
but
added
our
princess
hates
him
and
would
rather
wed
a
dragon
than
him
how
know
you
that
asked
huon
and
the
dame
informed
him
that
she
had
it
from
the
princess
herself
who
was
her
huon
inquired
the
reason
of
the
princess
aversion
and
the
woman
pleased
to
find
her
chat
excite
so
much
interest
replied
that
it
was
all
in
consequence
of
a
dream
a
dream
exclaimed
huon
yes
a
dream
she
dreamed
that
she
was
a
hind
and
that
the
prince
as
a
hunter
was
pursuing
her
and
had
almost
overtaken
her
when
a
beautiful
dwarf
appeared
in
view
drawn
in
a
golden
car
having
by
his
side
a
young
man
of
yellow
hair
and
fair
complexion
like
one
from
a
foreign
land
she
dreamed
that
the
car
stopped
where
she
stood
and
that
having
resumed
her
own
form
she
was
about
to
ascend
it
when
suddenly
it
faded
from
her
view
and
with
it
the
dwarf
and
the
youth
but
from
her
heart
that
vision
did
not
fade
and
from
that
time
her
affianced
bridegroom
the
hyrcanian
prince
had
become
odious
to
her
sight
yet
the
sultan
her
father
by
no
means
regarding
such
a
cause
as
sufficient
to
prevent
the
marriage
had
named
the
morrow
as
the
time
when
it
should
be
solemnized
in
presence
of
his
court
and
many
princes
of
the
neighboring
countries
whom
the
fame
of
the
princess
beauty
and
the
bridegroom
splendor
had
brought
to
the
scene
we
may
suppose
this
conversation
woke
a
tumult
of
thoughts
in
the
breast
of
huon
was
it
not
clear
that
providence
led
him
on
and
cleared
the
way
for
his
happy
success
sleep
did
not
early
visit
the
eyes
of
huon
that
night
but
with
the
sanguine
temper
of
youth
he
indulged
his
fancy
in
imagining
the
sequel
of
his
strange
experience
the
next
day
which
he
could
not
but
regard
as
the
decisive
day
of
his
fate
he
prepared
to
deliver
the
message
of
charlemagne
clad
in
his
armor
fortified
with
his
ivory
horn
and
his
ring
he
reached
the
palace
of
gaudisso
when
the
guests
were
assembled
at
the
banquet
as
he
approached
the
gate
a
voice
called
on
all
true
believers
to
enter
and
huon
the
brave
and
faithful
huon
in
his
impatience
passed
in
under
that
false
pretention
he
had
no
sooner
passed
the
barrier
than
he
felt
ashamed
of
his
baseness
and
was
overwhelmed
with
regret
to
make
amends
for
his
fault
he
ran
forward
to
the
second
gate
and
cried
to
the
porter
dog
of
a
misbeliever
i
command
you
in
the
name
of
him
who
died
on
the
cross
open
to
me
the
points
of
a
hundred
weapons
immediately
opposed
his
passage
huon
then
remembered
for
the
first
time
the
ring
he
had
received
from
his
uncle
the
governor
he
produced
it
and
demanded
to
be
led
to
the
sultan
presence
the
officer
of
the
guard
recognized
the
ring
made
a
respectful
obeisance
and
allowed
him
free
entrance
in
the
same
way
he
passed
the
other
doors
to
the
rich
saloon
where
the
great
sultan
was
at
dinner
with
his
tributary
princes
at
sight
of
the
ring
the
chief
attendant
led
huon
to
the
head
of
the
hall
and
introduced
him
to
the
sultan
and
his
princes
as
the
ambassador
of
charlemagne
a
seat
was
provided
for
him
near
the
royal
party
the
prince
of
hyrcania
the
same
whom
huon
had
rescued
from
the
lion
and
who
was
the
destined
bridegroom
of
the
beautiful
clarimunda
sat
on
the
sultan
right
hand
and
the
princess
herself
on
his
left
it
chanced
that
huon
found
himself
near
the
seat
of
the
princess
and
hardly
were
the
ceremonies
of
reception
over
before
he
made
haste
to
fulfill
the
commands
of
charlemagne
by
imprinting
a
kiss
upon
her
rosy
lips
and
after
that
a
second
not
by
command
but
by
good
will
the
prince
of
hyrcania
cried
out
audacious
infidel
take
the
reward
of
thy
insolence
and
aimed
a
blow
at
huon
which
if
it
had
reached
him
would
have
brought
his
embassy
to
a
speedy
termination
but
the
ingrate
failed
of
his
aim
and
huon
punished
his
blasphemy
and
ingratitude
at
once
by
a
blow
which
severed
his
head
from
his
body
so
suddenly
had
all
this
happened
that
no
hand
had
been
raised
to
arrest
it
but
now
gaudisso
cried
out
seize
the
murderer
huon
was
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
but
his
redoubtable
sword
kept
the
crowd
of
courtiers
at
bay
but
he
saw
new
combatants
enter
and
could
not
hope
to
maintain
his
ground
against
so
many
he
recollected
his
horn
and
raising
it
to
his
lips
blew
a
blast
almost
as
loud
as
that
of
roland
at
roncesvalles
it
was
in
vain
oberon
heard
it
but
the
sin
of
which
huon
had
been
guilty
in
bearing
though
but
for
a
moment
the
character
of
a
believer
in
the
false
prophet
had
put
it
out
of
oberon
power
to
help
him
huon
finding
himself
deserted
and
conscious
of
the
cause
lost
his
strength
and
energy
was
seized
loaded
with
chains
and
plunged
into
a
dungeon
his
life
was
spared
for
the
time
merely
that
he
might
be
reserved
for
a
more
painful
death
the
sultan
meant
that
after
being
made
to
feel
all
the
torments
of
hunger
and
despair
he
should
be
flayed
alive
but
an
enchanter
more
ancient
and
more
powerful
than
oberon
himself
interested
himself
for
the
brave
huon
the
enchanter
was
love
the
princess
clarimunda
learned
with
horror
the
fate
to
which
the
young
prince
was
destined
by
the
aid
of
her
governante
she
gained
over
the
keeper
of
the
prison
and
went
herself
to
lighten
the
chains
of
her
beloved
it
was
her
hand
that
removed
his
fetters
from
her
he
received
supplies
of
food
to
sustain
a
life
which
he
devoted
from
thenceforth
wholly
to
her
after
the
most
tender
explanations
the
princess
departed
promising
to
repeat
her
visit
on
the
morrow
the
next
day
she
came
according
to
promise
and
again
brought
supplies
of
food
these
visits
were
continued
during
a
whole
month
huon
was
too
good
a
son
of
the
church
to
forget
that
the
amiable
princess
was
a
saracen
and
he
availed
himself
of
these
interviews
to
instruct
her
in
the
true
faith
how
easy
it
is
to
believe
the
truth
when
uttered
by
the
lips
of
those
we
love
clarimunda
ere
long
professed
her
entire
belief
in
the
christian
doctrines
and
desired
to
be
baptized
meanwhile
the
sultan
had
repeatedly
inquired
of
the
jailer
how
his
prisoner
bore
the
pains
of
famine
and
learned
to
his
surprise
that
he
was
not
yet
much
reduced
thereby
on
his
repeating
the
inquiry
after
a
short
interval
the
keeper
replied
that
the
prisoner
had
died
suddenly
and
had
been
buried
in
the
cavern
the
sultan
could
only
regret
that
he
had
not
sooner
ordered
the
execution
of
the
sentence
while
these
things
were
going
on
the
faithful
sherasmin
who
had
not
accompanied
huon
in
his
last
adventure
but
had
learned
by
common
rumor
the
result
of
it
came
to
the
court
in
hopes
of
doing
something
for
the
rescue
of
his
master
he
presented
himself
to
the
sultan
as
solario
his
nephew
guadisso
received
him
with
kindness
and
all
the
courtiers
loaded
him
with
attentions
he
soon
found
means
to
inform
himself
how
the
princess
regarded
the
brave
but
unfortunate
huon
and
having
made
himself
known
to
her
confidence
was
soon
established
between
them
clarimunda
readily
consented
to
assist
in
the
escape
of
huon
and
to
quit
with
him
her
father
court
to
repair
to
that
of
charlemagne
their
united
efforts
had
nearly
perfected
their
arrangement
a
vessel
was
secretly
prepared
and
all
things
in
forwardness
for
the
flight
when
an
obstacle
presented
itself
huon
himself
positively
refused
to
go
leaving
the
orders
of
charlemagne
unexecuted
sherasmin
was
in
despair
bitterly
he
complained
of
the
fickleness
and
cruelty
of
oberon
in
withdrawing
his
aid
at
the
very
crisis
when
it
was
most
necessary
earnestly
he
urged
every
argument
to
satisfy
the
prince
that
he
had
done
enough
for
honor
and
could
not
be
held
bound
to
achieve
impossibilities
but
all
was
of
no
avail
and
he
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
when
one
of
those
events
occurred
which
are
so
frequent
under
turkish
despotisms
a
courier
arrived
at
the
court
of
the
sultan
bearing
the
ring
of
his
sovereign
the
mighty
agrapard
caliph
of
arabia
and
bringing
the
for
the
neck
of
gaudisso
no
reason
was
assigned
none
but
the
pleasure
of
the
caliph
is
ever
required
in
such
cases
but
it
was
suspected
that
the
bearer
of
the
had
persuaded
the
caliph
that
gaudisso
whose
rapacity
was
well
known
had
accumulated
immense
treasures
which
he
had
not
duly
shared
with
his
sovereign
and
thus
had
obtained
an
order
to
supersede
him
in
his
emirship
the
body
of
gaudisso
would
have
been
cast
out
a
prey
to
dogs
and
vultures
had
not
sherasmin
under
the
character
of
nephew
of
the
deceased
been
permitted
to
receive
it
and
give
it
decent
burial
which
he
did
but
not
till
he
had
taken
possession
of
the
beard
and
grinders
agreeably
to
the
orders
of
charlemagne
no
obstacle
now
stood
in
the
way
of
the
lovers
and
their
faithful
follower
in
returning
to
france
they
sailed
taking
rome
in
their
way
where
the
holy
father
himself
blessed
the
union
of
his
nephew
duke
huon
of
bordeaux
with
the
princess
clarimunda
soon
afterward
they
arrived
in
france
where
huon
laid
his
trophies
at
the
feet
of
charlemagne
and
being
restored
to
the
favor
of
the
emperor
hastened
to
present
himself
and
his
bride
to
the
duchess
his
mother
and
to
the
faithful
liegemen
of
his
province
of
guienne
and
his
city
of
bordeaux
where
the
pair
were
received
with
transports
of
joy
ogier
the
dane
ogier
the
dane
was
the
son
of
geoffrey
who
wrested
denmark
from
the
pagans
and
reigned
the
first
christian
king
of
that
country
when
ogier
was
born
and
before
he
was
baptized
six
ladies
of
ravishing
beauty
appeared
all
at
once
in
the
chamber
of
the
infant
they
encircled
him
and
she
who
appeared
the
eldest
took
him
in
her
arms
kissed
him
and
laid
her
hand
upon
his
heart
i
give
you
said
she
to
be
the
bravest
warrior
of
your
times
she
delivered
the
infant
to
her
sister
who
said
i
give
you
abundant
opportunities
to
display
your
valor
sister
said
the
third
lady
you
have
given
him
a
dangerous
boon
i
give
him
that
he
shall
never
be
vanquished
the
fourth
sister
added
as
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
eyes
and
his
mouth
i
give
you
the
gift
of
pleasing
the
fifth
said
lest
all
these
gifts
serve
only
to
betray
i
give
you
sensibility
to
return
the
love
you
inspire
then
spoke
morgana
the
youngest
and
handsomest
of
the
group
charming
creature
i
claim
you
for
my
own
and
i
give
you
not
to
die
till
you
shall
have
come
to
pay
me
a
visit
in
my
isle
of
avalon
then
she
kissed
the
child
and
departed
with
her
sisters
after
this
the
king
had
the
child
carried
to
the
font
and
baptized
with
the
name
of
ogier
in
his
education
nothing
was
neglected
to
elevate
him
to
the
standard
of
a
perfect
knight
and
render
him
accomplished
in
all
the
arts
necessary
to
make
him
a
hero
he
had
hardly
reached
the
age
of
sixteen
years
when
charlemagne
whose
power
was
established
over
all
the
sovereigns
of
his
time
recollected
that
geoffroy
ogier
father
had
omitted
to
render
the
homage
due
to
him
as
emperor
and
sovereign
lord
of
denmark
one
of
the
grand
fiefs
of
the
empire
he
accordingly
sent
an
embassy
to
demand
of
the
king
of
denmark
this
homage
and
on
receiving
a
refusal
couched
in
haughty
terms
sent
an
army
to
enforce
the
demand
geoffroy
after
an
unsuccessful
resistance
was
forced
to
comply
and
as
a
pledge
of
his
sincerity
delivered
ogier
his
eldest
son
a
hostage
to
charles
to
be
brought
up
at
his
court
he
was
placed
in
charge
of
the
duke
namo
of
bavaria
the
friend
of
his
father
who
treated
him
like
his
own
son
ogier
grew
up
more
and
more
handsome
and
amiable
every
day
he
surpassed
in
form
strength
and
address
all
the
noble
youths
his
companions
he
failed
not
to
be
present
at
all
tourneys
he
was
attentive
to
the
elder
knights
and
burned
with
impatience
to
imitate
them
yet
his
heart
rose
sometimes
in
secret
against
his
condition
as
a
hostage
and
as
one
apparently
forgotten
by
his
father
the
king
of
denmark
in
fact
was
at
this
time
occupied
with
new
loves
ogier
mother
having
died
he
had
married
a
second
wife
and
had
a
son
named
guyon
the
new
queen
had
absolute
power
over
her
husband
and
fearing
that
if
he
should
see
ogier
again
he
would
give
him
the
preference
over
guyon
she
had
adroitly
persuaded
him
to
delay
rendering
his
homage
to
charlemagne
till
now
four
years
had
passed
away
since
the
last
renewal
of
that
ceremony
charlemagne
irritated
at
this
delinquency
drew
closer
the
bonds
of
ogier
captivity
until
he
should
receive
a
response
from
the
king
of
denmark
to
a
fresh
summons
which
he
caused
to
be
sent
to
him
the
answer
of
geoffroy
was
insulting
and
defiant
and
the
rage
of
charlemagne
was
roused
in
the
highest
degree
he
was
at
first
disposed
to
wreak
his
vengeance
upon
ogier
his
hostage
but
at
the
entreaties
of
duke
namo
who
felt
towards
his
pupil
like
a
father
consented
to
spare
his
life
if
ogier
would
swear
fidelity
to
him
as
his
and
promise
not
to
quit
his
court
without
his
permission
ogier
accepted
these
terms
and
was
allowed
to
retain
all
the
freedom
he
had
before
enjoyed
the
emperor
would
have
immediately
taken
arms
to
reduce
his
disobedient
vassal
if
he
had
not
been
called
off
in
another
direction
by
a
message
from
pope
leo
imploring
his
assistance
the
saracens
had
landed
in
the
neighborhood
of
rome
occupied
mount
janiculum
and
prepared
to
pass
the
tiber
and
carry
fire
and
sword
to
the
capital
of
the
christian
world
charlemagne
hesitated
not
to
yield
to
the
entreaties
of
the
pope
he
speedily
assembled
an
army
crossed
the
alps
traversed
italy
and
arrived
at
spoleto
a
strong
place
to
which
the
pope
had
retired
leo
at
the
head
of
his
cardinals
advanced
to
meet
him
and
rendered
him
homage
as
to
the
son
of
pepin
the
illustrious
protector
of
the
holy
see
coming
as
his
father
had
done
to
defend
it
in
the
hour
of
need
charlemagne
stopped
but
two
days
at
spoleto
and
learning
that
the
infidels
having
rendered
themselves
masters
of
rome
were
besieging
the
capitol
which
could
not
long
hold
out
against
them
marched
promptly
to
attack
them
the
advanced
posts
of
the
army
were
commanded
by
duke
namo
on
whom
ogier
waited
as
his
squire
he
did
not
yet
bear
arms
not
having
received
the
order
of
knighthood
the
oriflamme
the
royal
standard
was
borne
by
a
knight
named
alory
who
showed
himself
unworthy
of
the
honor
duke
namo
seeing
a
strong
body
of
the
infidels
advancing
to
attack
him
gave
the
word
to
charge
them
ogier
remained
in
the
rear
with
the
other
youths
grieving
much
that
he
was
not
permitted
to
fight
very
soon
he
saw
alory
lower
the
oriflamme
and
turn
his
horse
in
flight
ogier
pointed
him
out
to
the
young
men
and
seizing
a
club
rushed
upon
alory
and
struck
him
from
his
horse
then
with
his
companions
he
disarmed
him
clothed
himself
in
his
armor
raised
the
oriflamme
and
mounting
the
horse
of
the
unworthy
knight
flew
to
the
front
rank
where
he
joined
duke
namo
drove
back
the
infidels
and
carried
the
oriflamme
quite
through
their
broken
ranks
the
duke
thinking
it
was
alory
whom
he
had
not
held
in
high
esteem
was
astonished
at
his
strength
and
valor
ogier
young
companions
imitated
him
supplying
themselves
with
armor
from
the
bodies
of
the
slain
they
followed
ogier
and
carried
death
into
the
ranks
of
the
saracens
who
fell
back
in
confusion
upon
their
main
body
duke
namo
now
ordered
a
retreat
and
ogier
obeyed
with
reluctance
when
they
perceived
charlemagne
advancing
to
their
assistance
the
combat
now
became
general
and
was
more
terrible
than
ever
charlemagne
had
overthrown
corsuble
the
commander
of
the
saracens
and
had
drawn
his
famous
sword
joyeuse
to
cut
off
his
head
when
two
saracen
knights
set
upon
him
at
once
one
of
whom
slew
his
horse
and
the
other
overthrew
the
emperor
on
the
sand
perceiving
by
the
eagle
on
his
casque
who
he
was
they
dismounted
in
haste
to
give
him
his
deathblow
never
was
the
life
of
the
emperor
in
such
peril
but
ogier
who
saw
him
fall
flew
to
his
rescue
though
embarrassed
with
the
oriflamme
he
pushed
his
horse
against
one
of
the
saracens
and
knocked
him
down
and
with
his
sword
dealt
the
other
so
vigorous
a
blow
that
he
fell
stunned
to
the
earth
then
helping
the
emperor
to
rise
he
remounted
him
on
the
horse
of
one
of
the
fallen
knights
brave
and
generous
alory
charles
exclaimed
i
owe
to
you
my
honor
and
my
life
ogier
made
no
answer
but
leaving
charlemagne
surrounded
by
a
great
many
of
the
knights
who
had
flown
to
his
succor
he
plunged
into
the
thickest
ranks
of
the
enemy
and
carried
the
oriflamme
followed
by
a
gallant
train
of
youthful
warriors
till
the
standard
of
mahomet
turned
in
retreat
and
the
infidels
sought
safety
in
their
intrenchments
then
the
good
archbishop
turpin
laid
aside
his
helmet
and
his
bloody
sword
for
he
always
felt
that
he
was
clearly
in
the
line
of
his
duty
while
slaying
infidels
took
his
mitre
and
his
crosier
and
intoned
te
deum
at
this
moment
ogier
covered
with
blood
and
dust
came
to
lay
the
oriflamme
at
the
feet
of
the
emperor
he
was
followed
by
a
train
of
warriors
of
short
stature
who
walked
ill
at
ease
loaded
with
armor
too
heavy
for
them
ogier
knelt
at
the
feet
of
charlemagne
who
embraced
him
calling
him
alory
while
turpin
from
the
height
of
the
altar
blessed
him
with
all
his
might
then
young
orlando
son
of
the
count
milone
and
nephew
of
charlemagne
no
longer
able
to
endure
this
misapprehension
threw
down
his
helmet
and
ran
to
unlace
ogier
while
the
other
young
men
laid
aside
theirs
our
author
says
he
can
not
express
the
surprise
the
admiration
and
the
tenderness
of
the
emperor
and
his
peers
charles
folded
ogier
in
his
arms
and
the
happy
fathers
of
those
brave
youths
embraced
them
with
tears
of
joy
the
good
duke
namo
stepped
forward
and
charlemagne
yielded
ogier
to
his
embrace
how
much
do
i
owe
you
he
said
good
and
wise
friend
for
having
restrained
my
anger
my
dear
ogier
i
owe
you
my
life
my
sword
leaps
to
touch
your
shoulder
yours
and
those
of
your
brave
young
friends
at
these
words
he
drew
that
famous
sword
joyeuse
and
while
ogier
and
the
rest
knelt
before
him
gave
them
the
accolade
conferring
on
them
the
order
of
knighthood
the
young
orlando
and
his
cousin
oliver
could
not
refrain
even
in
the
presence
of
the
emperor
from
falling
upon
ogier
neck
and
pledging
with
him
that
brotherhood
in
arms
so
dear
and
so
sacred
to
the
knights
of
old
times
but
charlot
the
emperor
son
at
the
sight
of
the
glory
with
which
ogier
had
covered
himself
conceived
the
blackest
jealousy
and
hate
the
rest
of
the
day
and
the
next
were
spent
in
the
rejoicings
of
the
army
turpin
in
a
solemn
service
implored
the
favor
of
heaven
upon
the
youthful
knights
and
blessed
the
white
armor
which
was
prepared
for
them
duke
namo
presented
them
with
golden
spurs
charles
himself
girded
on
their
swords
but
what
was
his
astonishment
when
he
examined
that
intended
for
ogier
the
loving
fairy
morgana
had
had
the
art
to
change
it
and
to
substitute
one
of
her
own
procuring
and
when
charles
drew
it
out
of
the
scabbard
these
words
appeared
written
on
the
steel
my
name
is
cortana
of
the
same
steel
and
temper
as
joyeuse
and
durindana
charles
saw
that
a
superior
power
watched
over
the
destinies
of
ogier
he
vowed
to
love
him
as
a
father
would
and
ogier
promised
him
the
devotion
of
a
son
happy
had
it
been
for
both
if
they
had
always
continued
mindful
of
their
promises
the
saracen
army
had
hardly
recovered
from
its
dismay
when
carahue
king
of
mauritania
who
was
one
of
the
knights
overthrown
by
ogier
at
the
time
of
the
rescue
of
charlemagne
determined
to
challenge
him
to
single
combat
with
that
view
he
assumed
the
dress
of
a
herald
resolved
to
carry
his
own
message
the
french
knights
admired
his
air
and
said
to
one
another
that
he
seemed
more
fit
to
be
a
knight
than
a
bearer
of
messages
carahue
began
by
passing
the
warmest
eulogium
upon
the
knight
who
bore
the
oriflamme
on
the
day
of
the
battle
and
concluded
by
saying
that
carahue
king
of
mauritania
respected
that
knight
so
much
that
he
challenged
him
to
the
combat
ogier
had
risen
to
reply
when
he
was
interrupted
by
charlot
who
said
that
the
gage
of
the
king
of
mauritania
could
not
fitly
be
received
by
a
vassal
living
in
captivity
by
which
he
meant
ogier
who
was
at
that
time
serving
as
hostage
for
his
father
fire
flashed
from
the
eyes
of
ogier
but
the
presence
of
the
emperor
restrained
his
speech
and
he
was
calmed
by
the
kind
looks
of
charlemagne
who
said
with
an
angry
voice
silence
charlot
by
the
life
of
bertha
my
queen
he
who
has
saved
my
life
is
as
dear
to
me
as
yourself
ogier
he
continued
you
are
no
longer
a
hostage
herald
report
my
answer
to
your
master
that
never
does
knight
of
my
court
refuse
a
challenge
on
equal
terms
ogier
the
dane
accepts
of
his
and
i
myself
am
his
security
carahue
profoundly
bowing
replied
my
lord
i
was
sure
that
the
sentiments
of
so
great
a
sovereign
as
yourself
would
be
worthy
of
your
high
and
brilliant
fame
i
shall
report
your
answer
to
my
master
who
i
know
admires
you
and
unwillingly
takes
arms
against
you
then
turning
to
charlot
whom
he
did
not
know
as
the
son
of
the
emperor
he
continued
as
for
you
sir
knight
if
the
desire
of
battle
inflames
you
i
have
it
in
charge
from
sadon
cousin
of
the
king
of
mauritania
to
give
the
like
defiance
to
any
french
knights
who
will
grant
him
the
honor
of
the
combat
charlot
inflamed
with
rage
and
vexation
at
the
public
reproof
which
he
had
just
received
hesitated
not
to
deliver
his
gage
carahue
received
it
with
ogier
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
combat
should
be
on
the
next
day
in
a
meadow
environed
by
woods
and
equally
distant
from
both
armies
the
perfidious
charlot
meditated
the
blackest
treason
during
the
night
he
collected
some
knights
unworthy
of
the
name
and
like
himself
in
their
ferocious
manners
he
made
them
swear
to
avenge
his
injuries
armed
them
in
black
armor
and
sent
them
to
lie
in
ambush
in
the
wood
with
orders
to
make
a
pretended
attack
upon
the
whole
party
but
in
fact
to
lay
heavy
hands
upon
ogier
and
the
two
saracens
at
the
dawn
of
day
sadon
and
carahue
attended
tonly
by
two
pages
to
carry
their
spears
took
their
way
to
the
appointed
meadow
and
charlot
and
ogier
repaired
thither
also
but
by
different
paths
ogier
advanced
with
a
calm
air
saluted
courteously
the
two
saracen
knights
and
joined
them
in
arranging
the
terms
of
combat
while
this
was
going
on
the
perfidious
charlot
remained
behind
and
gave
his
men
the
signal
to
advance
that
cowardly
troop
issued
from
the
wood
and
encompassed
the
three
knights
all
three
were
equally
surprised
at
the
attack
but
neither
of
them
suspected
the
other
to
have
any
hand
in
the
treason
seeing
the
attack
made
equally
upon
them
all
they
united
their
efforts
to
resist
it
and
made
the
most
forward
of
the
assailants
bite
the
dust
cortana
fell
on
no
one
without
inflicting
a
mortal
wound
but
the
sword
of
carahue
was
not
of
equal
temper
and
broke
in
his
hands
at
the
same
instant
his
horse
was
slain
and
carahue
fell
without
a
weapon
and
entangled
with
his
prostrate
horse
ogier
who
saw
it
ran
to
his
defence
and
leaping
to
the
ground
covered
the
prince
with
his
shield
supplied
him
with
the
sword
of
one
of
the
fallen
ruffians
and
would
have
him
mount
his
own
horse
at
that
moment
charlot
inflamed
with
rage
pushed
his
horse
upon
ogier
knocked
him
down
and
would
have
run
him
through
with
his
lance
if
sadon
who
saw
the
treason
had
not
sprung
upon
him
and
thrust
him
back
carahue
leapt
lightly
upon
the
horse
which
ogier
presented
him
and
had
time
only
to
exclaim
brave
ogier
i
am
no
longer
your
enemy
i
pledge
to
you
an
eternal
friendship
when
numerous
saracen
knights
were
seen
approaching
having
discovered
the
treachery
and
charlot
with
his
followers
took
refuge
in
the
wood
the
troop
which
advanced
was
commanded
by
dannemont
the
exiled
king
of
denmark
whom
geoffroy
ogier
father
had
driven
from
his
throne
and
compelled
to
take
refuge
with
the
saracens
learning
who
ogier
was
he
instantly
declared
him
his
prisoner
in
spite
of
the
urgent
remonstrances
and
even
threats
of
carahue
and
sadon
and
carried
him
under
a
strong
guard
to
the
saracen
camp
here
he
was
at
first
subjected
to
the
most
rigorous
captivity
but
carahue
and
sadon
insisted
so
vehemently
on
his
release
threatening
to
turn
their
arms
against
their
own
party
if
it
was
not
granted
while
dannemont
as
eagerly
opposed
the
measure
that
corsuble
the
saracen
commander
consented
to
a
middle
course
and
allowed
ogier
the
freedom
of
his
camp
upon
his
promise
not
to
leave
it
without
permission
carahue
was
not
satisfied
with
this
partial
concession
he
left
the
city
next
morning
proceeded
to
the
camp
of
charlemagne
and
demanded
to
be
led
to
the
emperor
when
he
reached
his
presence
he
dismounted
from
his
horse
took
off
his
helmet
drew
his
sword
and
holding
it
by
the
blade
presented
it
to
charlemagne
as
he
knelt
before
him
illustrious
prince
he
said
behold
before
you
the
herald
who
brought
the
challenge
to
your
knights
from
the
king
of
mauritania
the
cowardly
old
king
dannemont
has
made
the
brave
ogier
prisoner
and
has
prevailed
on
our
general
to
refuse
to
give
him
up
i
come
to
make
amends
for
this
ungenerous
conduct
by
yielding
myself
carahue
king
of
mauritania
your
prisoner
charlemagne
with
all
his
peers
admired
the
magnanimity
of
carahue
he
raised
him
embraced
him
and
restored
to
him
his
sword
prince
said
he
your
presence
and
the
bright
example
you
afford
my
knights
consoles
me
for
the
loss
of
ogier
would
to
god
you
might
receive
our
holy
faith
and
be
wholly
united
with
us
all
the
lords
of
the
court
led
by
duke
namo
paid
their
respects
to
the
king
of
mauritania
charlot
only
failed
to
appear
fearing
to
be
recognized
as
a
traitor
but
the
heart
of
carahue
was
too
noble
to
pierce
that
of
charlemagne
by
telling
him
the
treachery
of
his
son
meanwhile
the
saracen
army
was
rent
by
discord
the
troops
of
carahue
clamored
against
the
because
their
king
was
left
in
captivity
they
even
threatened
to
desert
the
cause
and
turn
their
arms
against
their
allies
charlemagne
pressed
the
siege
vigorously
till
at
length
the
saracen
leaders
found
themselves
compelled
to
abandon
the
city
and
betake
themselves
to
their
ships
a
truce
was
made
ogier
was
exchanged
for
carahue
and
the
two
friends
embraced
one
another
with
vows
of
perpetual
brotherhood
the
pope
was
reestablished
in
his
dominions
and
italy
being
tranquil
charlemagne
returned
with
his
peers
and
their
followers
to
france
ogier
the
dane
continued
charlemagne
had
not
forgotten
the
offence
of
geoffroy
the
king
of
denmark
in
withholding
homage
and
now
prepared
to
enforce
submission
but
at
this
crisis
he
was
waited
upon
by
an
embassy
from
geoffroy
acknowledging
his
fault
and
craving
assistance
against
an
army
of
invaders
who
had
attacked
his
states
with
a
force
which
he
was
unable
to
repel
the
soul
of
charlemagne
was
too
great
to
be
implacable
and
he
took
this
opportunity
to
test
that
of
ogier
who
had
felt
acutely
the
unkindness
of
his
father
in
leaving
him
without
regard
or
notice
fifteen
years
in
captivity
charles
asked
ogier
whether
in
spite
of
his
neglect
he
was
disposed
to
lead
an
army
to
his
assistance
he
replied
a
son
can
never
be
excused
from
helping
his
father
by
any
cause
short
of
death
charlemagne
placed
an
army
of
a
thousand
knights
under
the
command
of
ogier
and
great
numbers
more
volunteered
to
march
under
so
distinguished
a
leader
he
flew
to
the
succor
of
his
father
repelled
the
invaders
and
drove
them
in
confusion
to
their
vessels
ogier
then
hastened
to
the
capital
but
as
he
drew
near
the
city
he
heard
all
the
bells
sounding
a
knell
he
soon
learned
the
cause
it
was
the
obsequies
of
geoffroy
the
king
ogier
felt
keenly
the
grief
of
not
having
been
permitted
to
embrace
his
father
once
more
and
to
learn
his
latest
commands
but
he
found
that
his
father
had
declared
him
heir
to
his
throne
he
hastened
to
the
church
where
the
body
lay
he
knelt
and
bathed
the
lifeless
form
with
his
tears
at
that
moment
a
celestial
light
beamed
all
around
and
a
voice
of
an
angel
said
ogier
leave
thy
crown
to
guyon
thy
brother
and
bear
no
other
title
than
that
of
dane
thy
destiny
is
glorious
and
other
kingdoms
are
reserved
for
thee
ogier
obeyed
the
divine
behest
he
saluted
his
stepmother
respectfully
and
embracing
his
brother
told
him
that
he
was
content
with
his
lot
in
being
reckoned
among
the
paladins
of
charlemagne
and
resigned
all
claims
to
the
crown
of
denmark
ogier
returned
covered
with
glory
to
the
court
of
charlemagne
and
the
emperor
touched
with
this
proof
of
his
attachment
loaded
him
with
caresses
and
treated
him
almost
as
an
equal
we
pass
in
silence
the
adventures
of
ogier
for
several
ensuing
years
in
which
the
of
his
infancy
showed
their
force
in
making
him
successful
in
all
enterprises
both
of
love
and
war
he
married
the
charming
belicene
and
became
the
father
of
young
baldwin
a
youth
who
seemed
to
inherit
in
full
measure
the
strength
and
courage
of
his
father
and
the
beauty
of
his
mother
when
the
lad
was
old
enough
to
be
separated
from
his
mother
ogier
took
him
to
court
and
presented
him
to
charlemagne
who
embraced
him
and
took
him
into
his
service
it
seemed
to
duke
namo
and
all
the
elder
knights
as
if
they
saw
in
him
ogier
himself
as
he
was
when
a
youth
and
this
resemblance
won
for
the
lad
their
kind
regards
even
charlot
at
first
seemed
to
be
fond
of
him
though
after
a
while
the
resemblance
to
ogier
which
he
noticed
had
the
effect
to
excite
his
hatred
baldwin
was
attentive
to
charlot
and
lost
no
occasion
to
be
serviceable
the
prince
loved
to
play
chess
and
baldwin
who
played
well
often
made
a
party
with
him
one
day
charlot
was
nettled
at
losing
two
pieces
in
succession
he
thought
he
could
by
taking
a
piece
from
baldwin
get
some
amends
for
his
loss
but
baldwin
seeing
him
fall
into
a
trap
which
he
had
set
for
him
could
not
help
a
slight
laugh
as
he
said
chariot
rose
in
a
fury
seized
the
rich
and
heavy
and
dashed
it
with
all
his
strength
on
the
head
of
baldwin
who
fell
and
died
where
he
fell
frightened
at
his
own
crime
and
fearing
the
vengeance
of
the
terrible
ogier
charlot
concealed
himself
in
the
interior
of
the
palace
a
young
companion
of
baldwin
hastened
and
informed
ogier
of
the
event
he
ran
to
the
chamber
and
beheld
the
body
of
his
child
bathed
in
blood
and
it
could
not
be
concealed
from
him
that
charlot
gave
the
blow
transported
with
rage
ogier
sought
charlot
through
the
palace
and
charlot
feeling
safe
nowhere
else
took
refuge
in
the
hall
of
charlemagne
where
he
seated
himself
at
table
with
duke
namo
and
salomon
duke
of
brittany
ogier
with
sword
drawn
followed
him
to
the
very
table
of
the
emperor
when
a
cupbearer
attempted
to
bar
his
way
he
struck
the
cup
from
his
hand
and
dashed
the
contents
in
the
emperor
face
charles
rose
in
a
passion
seized
a
knife
and
would
have
plunged
it
into
his
breast
had
not
salomon
and
another
baron
thrown
themselves
between
while
namo
who
had
retained
his
ancient
influence
over
ogier
drew
him
out
of
the
room
foreseeing
the
consequence
of
this
violence
pitying
ogier
and
in
his
heart
excusing
him
namo
hurried
him
away
before
the
guards
of
the
palace
could
arrest
him
made
him
mount
his
horse
and
leave
paris
charlemagne
called
together
his
peers
and
made
them
take
an
oath
to
do
all
in
their
power
to
arrest
ogier
and
bring
him
to
condign
punishment
ogier
on
his
part
sent
messages
to
the
emperor
offering
to
give
himself
up
on
condition
that
charlot
should
be
punished
for
his
atrocious
crime
the
emperor
would
listen
to
no
conditions
and
went
in
pursuit
of
ogier
at
the
head
of
a
large
body
of
soldiers
ogier
on
the
other
hand
was
warmly
supported
by
many
knights
who
pledged
themselves
in
his
defence
the
contest
raged
long
with
no
decisive
results
ogier
more
than
once
had
the
emperor
in
his
power
but
declined
to
avail
himself
of
his
advantage
and
released
him
without
conditions
he
even
implored
pardon
for
himself
but
demanded
at
the
same
time
the
punishment
of
charlot
but
charlemagne
was
too
blindly
fond
of
his
unworthy
son
to
subject
him
to
punishment
for
the
sake
of
conciliating
one
who
had
been
so
deeply
injured
at
length
distressed
at
the
blood
which
his
friends
had
lost
in
his
cause
ogier
dismissed
his
little
army
and
slipping
away
from
those
who
wished
to
attend
him
took
his
course
to
rejoin
the
duke
guyon
his
brother
on
his
way
having
reached
the
forest
of
ardennes
weary
with
long
travel
the
freshness
of
a
retired
valley
tempted
him
to
lie
down
to
take
some
repose
he
unsaddled
beiffror
relieved
himself
of
his
helmet
lay
down
on
the
turf
rested
his
head
on
his
shield
and
slept
it
so
happened
that
turpin
who
occasionally
recalled
to
mind
that
he
was
archbishop
of
rheins
was
at
that
time
in
the
vicinity
making
a
pastoral
visit
to
the
churches
under
his
jurisdiction
but
his
dignity
of
peer
of
france
and
his
martial
spirit
which
caused
him
to
be
reckoned
among
the
preux
chevaliers
of
his
time
forbade
him
to
travel
without
as
large
a
retinue
of
knights
as
he
had
of
clergymen
one
of
these
was
thirsty
and
knowing
the
fountain
on
the
borders
of
which
ogier
was
reposing
he
rode
to
it
and
was
struck
by
the
sight
of
a
knight
stretched
on
the
ground
he
hastened
back
and
let
the
archbishop
know
who
approached
the
fountain
and
recognized
ogier
the
first
impulse
of
the
good
and
generous
turpin
was
to
save
his
friend
for
whom
he
felt
the
warmest
attachment
but
his
archdeacons
and
knights
who
also
recognized
ogier
reminded
the
archbishop
of
the
oath
which
the
emperor
had
exacted
of
them
all
turpin
could
not
be
false
to
his
oath
but
it
was
not
without
a
groan
that
he
permitted
his
followers
to
bind
the
sleeping
knight
the
archbishop
attendants
secured
the
horse
and
arms
of
ogier
and
conducted
their
prisoner
to
the
emperor
at
soissons
the
emperor
had
become
so
much
embittered
by
ogier
obstinate
resistance
added
to
his
original
fault
that
he
was
disposed
to
order
him
to
instant
death
but
turpin
seconded
by
the
good
dukes
namo
and
salomon
prayed
so
hard
for
him
that
charlemagne
consented
to
remit
a
violent
death
but
sentenced
him
to
close
imprisonment
under
the
charge
of
the
archbishop
strictly
limiting
his
food
to
one
quarter
of
a
loaf
of
bread
per
day
with
one
piece
of
meat
and
a
quarter
of
a
cup
of
wine
in
this
way
he
hoped
to
quickly
put
an
end
to
his
life
without
bringing
on
himself
the
hostility
of
the
king
of
denmark
and
other
powerful
friends
of
ogier
he
exacted
a
new
oath
of
turpin
to
obey
his
order
strictly
the
good
archbishop
loved
ogier
too
well
not
to
cast
about
for
some
means
of
saving
his
life
which
he
foresaw
he
would
soon
lose
if
subjected
to
such
scanty
fare
for
ogier
was
seven
feet
tall
and
had
an
appetite
in
proportion
turpin
remembered
moreover
that
ogier
was
a
true
son
of
the
church
always
zealous
to
propagate
the
faith
and
subdue
unbelievers
so
he
felt
justified
in
practising
on
this
occasion
what
in
later
times
has
been
entitled
mental
reservation
without
swerving
from
the
letter
of
the
oath
which
he
had
taken
this
is
the
method
he
hit
upon
every
morning
he
had
his
prisoner
supplied
with
a
quarter
of
a
loaf
of
bread
made
of
two
bushels
of
flour
to
this
he
added
a
quarter
of
a
sheep
or
a
fat
calf
and
he
had
a
cup
made
which
held
forty
pints
of
wine
and
allowed
ogier
a
quarter
of
it
daily
ogier
imprisonment
lasted
long
charlemagne
was
astonished
to
hear
from
time
to
time
that
he
still
held
out
and
when
he
inquired
more
particularly
of
turpin
the
good
archbishop
relying
on
his
own
understanding
of
the
words
did
not
hesitate
to
affirm
positively
that
he
allowed
his
prisoner
no
more
than
the
permitted
ration
we
forgot
to
say
that
when
ogier
was
led
prisoner
to
soissons
the
abbot
of
saint
faron
observing
the
fine
horse
beiffror
and
not
having
at
the
time
any
other
favor
to
ask
of
charlemagne
begged
the
emperor
to
give
him
the
horse
and
had
him
taken
to
his
abbey
he
was
impatient
to
try
his
new
acquisition
and
when
he
had
arrived
in
his
litter
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
where
the
horse
had
been
brought
to
meet
him
mounted
him
and
rode
onward
the
horse
accustomed
to
bear
the
enormous
weight
of
ogier
in
his
armor
when
he
perceived
nothing
on
his
back
but
the
light
weight
of
the
abbot
whose
long
robes
fluttered
against
his
sides
ran
away
making
prodigious
leaps
over
the
steep
acclivities
of
the
mountain
till
he
reached
the
convent
of
jouaire
where
in
sight
of
the
abbess
and
her
nuns
he
threw
the
abbot
already
half
dead
with
fright
to
the
ground
the
abbot
bruised
and
mortified
revenged
himself
on
poor
beiffror
whom
he
condemned
in
his
wrath
to
be
given
to
the
workmen
to
drag
stones
for
a
chapel
that
he
was
building
near
the
abbey
thus
and
often
beaten
the
noble
horse
beiffror
passed
the
time
while
his
master
imprisonment
lasted
that
imprisonment
would
have
been
as
long
as
his
life
if
it
had
not
been
for
some
important
events
which
forced
the
emperor
to
set
ogier
at
liberty
the
emperor
learned
at
the
same
time
that
carahue
king
of
mauritania
was
assembling
an
army
to
come
and
demand
the
liberation
of
ogier
that
guyon
king
of
denmark
was
prepared
to
second
the
enterprise
with
all
his
forces
and
worse
than
all
that
the
saracens
under
bruhier
sultan
of
arabia
had
landed
in
gascony
taken
bordeaux
and
were
marching
with
all
speed
for
paris
charlemagne
now
felt
how
necessary
the
aid
of
ogier
was
to
him
but
in
spite
of
the
representations
of
turpin
namo
and
salomon
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
consent
to
surrender
charlot
to
such
punishment
as
ogier
should
see
fit
to
impose
besides
he
believed
that
ogier
was
without
strength
and
vigor
weakened
by
imprisonment
and
long
abstinence
at
this
crisis
he
received
a
message
from
bruhier
proposing
to
put
the
issue
upon
the
result
of
a
combat
between
himself
and
the
emperor
or
his
champion
promising
if
defeated
to
withdraw
his
army
charlemagne
would
willingly
have
accepted
the
challenge
but
his
counsellors
all
opposed
it
the
herald
was
therefore
told
that
the
emperor
would
take
time
to
consider
his
proposition
and
give
his
answer
the
next
day
it
was
during
this
interval
that
the
three
dukes
succeeded
in
prevailing
upon
charlemagne
to
pardon
ogier
and
to
send
for
him
to
combat
the
puissant
enemy
who
now
defied
him
but
it
was
no
easy
task
to
persuade
ogier
the
idea
of
his
long
imprisonment
and
the
recollection
of
his
son
bleeding
and
dying
in
his
arms
by
the
blow
of
the
ferocious
charlot
made
him
long
resist
the
urgency
of
his
friends
though
glory
called
him
to
encounter
bruhier
and
the
safety
of
christendom
demanded
the
destruction
of
this
proud
enemy
of
the
faith
ogier
only
yielded
at
last
on
condition
that
charlot
should
be
delivered
into
his
hands
to
be
dealt
with
as
he
should
see
fit
the
terms
were
hard
but
the
danger
was
pressing
and
charlemagne
with
a
returning
sense
of
justice
and
a
strong
confidence
in
the
generous
though
passionate
soul
of
ogier
at
last
consented
to
them
ogier
was
led
into
the
presence
of
charlemagne
by
the
three
peers
the
emperor
faithful
to
his
word
had
caused
charlot
to
be
brought
into
the
hall
where
the
high
barons
were
assembled
his
hands
tied
and
his
head
uncovered
when
the
emperor
saw
ogier
approach
he
took
charlot
by
the
arm
led
him
towards
ogier
and
said
these
words
i
surrender
the
criminal
do
with
him
as
you
think
fit
ogier
without
replying
seized
charlot
by
the
hair
forced
him
on
his
knees
and
lifted
with
the
other
hand
his
irresistible
sword
charlemagne
who
expected
to
see
the
head
of
his
son
rolling
at
his
feet
shut
his
eyes
and
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
ogier
had
done
enough
the
next
moment
he
raised
charlot
cut
his
bonds
kissed
him
on
the
mouth
and
hastened
to
throw
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
emperor
nothing
can
exceed
the
surprise
and
joy
of
charlemagne
at
seeing
his
son
unharmed
and
ogier
kneeling
at
his
feet
he
folded
him
in
his
arms
bathed
him
with
tears
and
exclaimed
to
his
barons
i
feel
at
this
moment
that
ogier
is
greater
than
i
as
for
charlot
his
base
soul
felt
nothing
but
the
joy
of
having
escaped
death
he
remained
such
as
he
had
been
and
it
was
not
till
some
years
afterwards
he
received
the
punishment
he
deserved
from
the
hands
of
huon
of
bordeaux
as
we
have
seen
in
a
former
chapter
ogier
the
dane
continued
when
charlemagne
had
somewhat
recovered
his
composure
he
was
surprised
to
observe
that
ogier
appeared
in
good
case
and
had
a
healthy
color
in
his
cheeks
he
turned
to
the
archbishop
who
could
not
help
blushing
as
he
met
his
eye
by
the
head
of
bertha
my
queen
said
charlemagne
ogier
has
had
good
quarters
in
your
castle
my
lord
archbishop
but
so
much
the
more
am
i
indebted
to
you
all
the
barons
laughed
and
jested
with
turpin
who
only
said
laugh
as
much
as
you
please
my
lords
but
for
my
part
i
am
not
sorry
to
see
the
arm
in
full
vigor
that
is
to
avenge
us
on
the
proud
saracen
charlemagne
immediately
despatched
his
herald
accepting
the
challenge
and
appointing
the
next
day
but
one
for
the
encounter
the
proud
and
crafty
bruhier
laughed
scornfully
when
he
heard
the
reply
accepting
his
challenge
for
he
had
a
reliance
on
certain
resources
besides
his
natural
strength
and
skill
however
he
swore
by
mahomet
to
observe
the
conditions
as
proposed
and
agreed
upon
ogier
now
demanded
his
armor
and
it
was
brought
to
him
in
excellent
condition
for
the
good
turpin
had
kept
it
faithfully
but
it
was
not
easy
to
provide
a
horse
for
the
occasion
charlemagne
had
the
best
horses
of
his
stables
brought
out
except
blanchard
his
own
charger
but
all
in
vain
the
weight
of
ogier
bent
their
backs
to
the
ground
in
this
embarrassment
the
archbishop
remembered
that
the
emperor
had
given
beiffror
to
the
abbot
of
faron
and
sent
off
a
courier
in
haste
to
him
monks
are
hard
masters
and
the
one
who
directed
the
laborers
at
the
abbey
had
but
too
faithfully
obeyed
the
orders
of
the
abbot
poor
beiffror
was
brought
back
lean
spiritless
and
chafed
with
the
harness
of
the
vile
cart
that
he
had
had
to
draw
so
long
he
carried
his
head
down
and
trod
heavily
before
charlemagne
but
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
ogier
he
raised
his
head
he
neighed
his
eyes
flashed
his
former
ardor
showed
itself
by
the
force
with
which
he
pawed
the
ground
ogier
caressed
him
and
the
good
steed
seemed
to
return
his
caresses
ogier
mounted
him
and
beiffror
proud
of
carrying
his
master
again
leapt
and
curvetted
with
all
his
youthful
vigor
nothing
being
now
wanted
charlemagne
at
the
head
of
his
army
marched
forth
from
the
city
of
paris
and
occupied
the
hill
of
montmartre
whence
the
view
extended
over
the
plain
of
denis
where
the
battle
was
to
be
fought
when
the
appointed
day
came
the
dukes
namo
and
salomon
as
seconds
of
ogier
accompanied
him
to
the
place
marked
out
for
the
lists
and
bruhier
with
two
distinguished
emirs
presented
himself
on
the
other
side
bruhier
was
in
high
spirits
and
jested
with
his
friends
as
he
advanced
upon
the
appearance
of
beiffror
is
that
the
horse
they
presume
to
match
with
marchevallee
the
best
steed
that
ever
fed
in
the
vales
of
mount
atlas
but
now
the
combatants
having
met
and
saluted
each
other
ride
apart
to
come
together
in
full
career
beiffror
flew
over
the
plain
and
met
the
adversary
more
than
the
lances
of
the
two
combatants
were
shivered
at
the
shock
and
bruhier
was
astonished
to
see
almost
at
the
same
instant
the
sword
of
ogier
gleaming
above
his
head
he
parried
it
with
his
buckler
and
gave
ogier
a
blow
on
his
helmet
who
returned
it
with
another
better
aimed
or
better
seconded
by
the
temper
of
his
blade
for
it
cut
away
part
of
bruhier
helmet
and
with
it
his
ear
and
part
of
his
cheek
ogier
seeing
the
blood
did
not
immediately
repeat
his
blow
and
bruhier
seized
the
moment
to
gallop
off
at
one
side
as
he
rode
he
took
a
vase
of
gold
which
hung
at
his
and
bathed
with
its
contents
the
wounded
part
the
blood
instantly
ceased
to
flow
the
ear
and
the
flesh
were
restored
quite
whole
and
the
dane
was
astonished
to
see
his
antagonist
return
to
the
ground
as
sound
as
ever
bruhier
laughed
at
his
amazement
know
said
he
that
i
possess
the
precious
balm
that
joseph
of
arimathea
used
upon
the
body
of
the
crucified
one
whom
you
worship
if
i
should
lose
an
arm
i
could
restore
it
with
a
few
drops
of
this
it
is
useless
for
you
to
contend
with
me
yield
yourself
and
as
you
appear
to
be
a
strong
fellow
i
will
make
you
first
oarsman
in
one
of
my
galleys
ogier
though
boiling
with
rage
forgot
not
to
implore
the
assistance
of
heaven
o
lord
he
exclaimed
suffer
not
the
enemy
of
thy
name
to
profit
by
the
powerful
help
of
that
which
owes
all
its
virtue
to
thy
divine
blood
at
these
words
he
attacked
bruhier
again
with
more
vigor
than
ever
both
struck
terrible
blows
and
made
grievous
wounds
but
the
blood
flowed
from
those
of
ogier
while
bruhier
stanched
his
by
the
application
of
his
balm
ogier
desperate
at
the
unequal
contest
grasped
cortana
with
both
hands
and
struck
his
enemy
such
a
blow
that
it
cleft
his
buckler
and
cut
off
his
arm
with
it
but
bruhier
at
the
same
time
launched
one
at
ogier
which
missing
him
struck
the
head
of
beiffror
and
the
good
horse
fell
and
drew
down
his
master
in
his
fall
bruhier
had
time
to
leap
to
the
ground
to
pick
up
his
arm
and
apply
his
balsam
then
before
ogier
had
recovered
his
footing
he
rushed
forward
with
sword
uplifted
to
complete
his
destruction
charlemagne
from
the
height
of
montmartre
seeing
the
brave
ogier
in
this
situation
groaned
and
was
ready
to
murmur
against
providence
but
the
good
turpin
raising
his
arms
with
a
faith
like
that
of
moses
drew
down
upon
the
christian
warrior
the
favor
of
heaven
ogier
promptly
disengaging
himself
pressed
bruhier
with
so
much
impetuosity
that
he
drove
him
to
a
distance
from
his
horse
to
whose
the
precious
balm
was
suspended
and
very
soon
charlemagne
saw
ogier
now
completely
in
the
advantage
bring
his
enemy
to
his
knees
tear
off
his
helmet
and
with
a
sweep
of
his
sword
strike
his
head
from
his
body
after
the
victory
ogier
seized
marchevallee
leaped
upon
his
back
and
became
possessed
of
the
precious
flask
a
few
drops
from
which
closed
his
wounds
and
restored
his
strength
the
french
knights
who
had
been
bruhier
captives
now
released
pressed
round
ogier
to
thank
him
for
their
deliverance
charlemagne
and
his
nobles
as
soon
as
their
attention
was
relieved
from
the
single
combat
perceived
from
their
elevated
position
an
unusual
agitation
in
the
enemy
camp
they
attributed
it
at
first
to
the
death
of
their
general
but
soon
the
noise
of
arms
the
cries
of
combatants
and
new
standards
which
advanced
disclosed
to
them
the
fact
that
bruhier
army
was
attacked
by
a
new
enemy
the
emperor
was
right
it
was
the
brave
carahue
of
mauritania
who
with
an
army
had
arrived
in
france
resolved
to
attempt
the
liberation
of
ogier
his
brother
in
arms
learning
on
his
arrival
the
changed
aspect
of
affairs
he
hesitated
not
to
render
a
signal
service
to
the
emperor
by
attacking
the
army
of
bruhier
in
the
midst
of
the
consternation
occasioned
by
the
loss
of
its
commander
ogier
recognized
the
standard
of
his
friend
and
leaping
upon
marchevallee
flew
to
aid
his
attack
charlemagne
followed
with
his
army
and
the
saracen
host
after
an
obstinate
conflict
was
forced
to
surrender
unconditionally
the
interview
of
ogier
and
carahue
was
such
as
might
be
anticipated
of
two
such
attached
friends
and
accomplished
knights
charlemagne
went
to
meet
them
embraced
them
and
putting
the
king
of
mauritania
on
his
right
and
ogier
on
his
left
returned
with
triumph
to
paris
there
the
empress
bertha
and
the
ladies
of
her
court
crowned
them
with
laurels
and
the
sage
and
gallant
eginhard
chamberlain
and
secretary
of
the
emperor
wrote
all
these
great
events
in
his
history
a
few
days
after
guyon
king
of
denmark
arrived
in
france
with
a
chosen
band
of
knights
and
sent
an
ambassador
to
charlemagne
to
say
that
he
came
not
as
an
enemy
but
to
render
homage
to
him
as
the
best
knight
of
the
time
and
the
head
of
the
christian
world
charlemagne
gave
the
ambassador
a
cordial
reception
and
mounting
his
horse
rode
forward
to
meet
the
king
of
denmark
these
great
princes
being
assembled
at
the
court
of
charles
held
council
together
and
the
ancient
and
sage
barons
were
called
to
join
it
it
was
decided
that
the
united
danish
and
mauritanian
armies
should
cross
the
sea
and
carry
the
war
to
the
country
of
the
saracens
and
that
a
thousand
french
knights
should
range
themselves
under
the
banner
of
ogier
the
dane
who
though
not
a
king
should
have
equal
rank
with
the
two
others
we
have
not
space
to
record
all
the
illustrious
actions
performed
by
ogier
and
his
allies
in
this
war
suffice
it
to
say
they
subdued
the
saracens
of
ptolemais
and
judaea
and
erecting
those
regions
into
a
kingdom
placed
the
crown
upon
the
head
of
ogier
guyon
and
carahue
then
left
him
to
return
to
their
respective
dominions
ogier
adopted
walter
the
son
of
guyon
of
denmark
to
be
his
successor
in
his
kingdom
he
superintended
his
education
and
saw
the
young
prince
grow
up
worthy
of
his
cares
but
ogier
in
spite
of
all
the
honors
of
his
rank
often
regretted
the
court
of
charlemagne
the
duke
namo
and
salomon
of
brittany
for
whom
he
had
the
respect
and
attachment
of
a
son
at
last
finding
walter
old
enough
to
sustain
the
weight
of
government
ogier
caused
a
vessel
to
be
prepared
secretly
and
attended
only
by
one
squire
left
his
palace
by
night
and
embarked
to
return
to
france
the
vessel
driven
by
a
fair
wind
cut
the
sea
with
the
swiftness
of
a
bird
but
on
a
sudden
it
deviated
from
its
course
no
longer
obeyed
the
helm
and
sped
fast
towards
a
black
promontory
which
stretched
into
the
sea
this
was
a
mountain
of
loadstone
and
its
attractive
power
increasing
as
the
distance
diminished
the
vessel
at
last
flew
with
the
swiftness
of
an
arrow
towards
it
and
was
dashed
to
pieces
on
its
rocky
base
ogier
alone
saved
himself
and
reached
the
shore
on
a
fragment
of
the
wreck
ogier
advanced
into
the
country
looking
for
some
marks
of
inhabitancy
but
found
none
on
a
sudden
he
encountered
two
monstrous
animals
covered
with
glittering
scales
accompanied
by
a
horse
breathing
fire
ogier
drew
his
sword
and
prepared
to
defend
himself
but
the
monsters
terrific
as
they
appeared
made
no
attempt
to
assail
him
and
the
horse
papillon
knelt
down
and
appeared
to
court
ogier
to
mount
upon
his
back
ogier
hesitated
not
to
see
the
adventure
through
he
mounted
papillon
who
ran
with
speed
and
soon
cleared
the
rocks
and
precipices
which
hemmed
in
and
concealed
a
beautiful
landscape
he
continued
his
course
till
he
reached
a
magnificent
palace
and
without
allowing
ogier
time
to
admire
it
crossed
a
grand
adorned
with
colonnades
and
entered
a
garden
where
making
his
way
through
alleys
of
myrtle
he
checked
his
course
and
knelt
down
on
the
enamelled
turf
of
a
fountain
ogier
dismounted
and
took
some
steps
along
the
margin
of
the
stream
but
was
soon
stopped
by
meeting
a
young
beauty
such
as
they
paint
the
graces
and
almost
as
lightly
attired
as
they
at
the
same
moment
to
his
amazement
his
armor
fell
off
of
its
own
accord
the
young
beauty
advanced
with
a
tender
air
and
placed
upon
his
head
a
crown
of
flowers
at
that
instant
the
danish
hero
lost
his
memory
his
combats
his
glory
charlemagne
and
his
court
all
vanished
from
his
mind
he
saw
only
morgana
he
desired
nothing
but
to
sigh
forever
at
her
feet
we
abridge
the
narrative
of
all
the
delights
which
ogier
enjoyed
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
time
flew
by
leaving
no
impression
of
its
flight
morgana
youthful
charms
did
not
decay
and
ogier
had
none
of
those
warnings
of
increasing
years
which
less
favored
mortals
never
fail
to
receive
there
is
no
knowing
how
long
this
blissful
state
might
have
lasted
if
it
had
not
been
for
an
accident
by
which
morgana
one
day
in
a
sportive
moment
snatched
the
crown
from
his
head
that
moment
ogier
regained
his
memory
and
lost
his
contentment
the
recollection
of
charlemagne
and
of
his
own
relatives
and
friends
saddened
the
hours
which
he
passed
with
morgana
the
fairy
saw
with
grief
the
changed
looks
of
her
lover
at
last
she
drew
from
him
the
acknowledgment
that
he
wished
to
go
at
least
for
a
time
to
revisit
charles
court
she
consented
with
reluctance
and
with
her
own
hands
helped
to
reinvest
him
with
his
armor
papillon
was
led
forth
ogier
mounted
him
and
taking
a
tender
adieu
of
the
tearful
morgana
crossed
at
rapid
speed
the
rocky
belt
which
separated
morgana
palace
from
the
borders
of
the
sea
the
which
had
received
him
at
his
coming
awaited
him
on
the
shore
one
of
them
took
ogier
on
his
back
and
the
other
placing
himself
under
papillon
they
spread
their
broad
fins
and
in
a
short
time
traversed
the
wide
space
that
separates
the
isle
of
avalon
from
france
they
landed
ogier
on
the
coast
of
languedoc
and
then
plunged
into
the
sea
and
disappeared
ogier
remounted
on
papillon
who
carried
him
across
the
kingdom
almost
as
fast
as
he
had
passed
the
sea
he
arrived
under
the
walls
of
paris
which
he
would
scarcely
have
recognized
if
the
high
towers
of
genevieve
had
not
caught
his
eye
he
went
straight
to
the
palace
of
charlemagne
which
seemed
to
him
to
have
been
entirely
rebuilt
his
surprise
was
extreme
and
increased
still
more
on
finding
that
he
understood
with
difficulty
the
language
of
the
guards
and
attendants
in
replying
to
his
questions
and
seeing
them
smile
as
they
tried
to
explain
to
one
another
the
language
in
which
he
addressed
them
presently
the
attention
of
some
of
the
barons
who
were
going
to
court
was
attracted
to
the
scene
and
ogier
who
recognized
the
badges
of
their
rank
addressed
them
and
inquired
if
the
dukes
namo
and
salomon
were
still
residing
at
the
emperor
court
at
this
question
the
barons
looked
at
one
another
in
amazement
and
one
of
the
eldest
said
to
the
rest
how
much
this
knight
resembles
the
portrait
of
my
ogier
the
dane
ah
my
dear
nephew
i
am
ogier
the
dane
said
he
and
he
remembered
that
morgana
had
told
him
that
he
was
little
aware
of
the
flight
of
time
during
his
abode
with
her
the
barons
more
astonished
than
ever
concluded
to
conduct
him
to
the
monarch
who
then
reigned
the
great
hugh
capet
the
brave
ogier
entered
the
palace
without
hesitation
but
when
on
reaching
the
royal
hall
the
barons
directed
him
to
make
his
obeisance
to
the
king
of
france
he
was
astonished
to
see
a
man
of
short
stature
and
large
head
whose
air
nevertheless
was
noble
and
martial
seated
upon
the
throne
on
which
he
had
so
often
seen
charlemagne
the
tallest
and
handsomest
sovereign
of
his
time
ogier
recounted
his
adventures
with
simplicity
and
affectedness
hugh
capet
was
slow
to
believe
him
but
ogier
recalled
so
many
proofs
and
circumstances
that
at
last
he
was
forced
to
recognize
the
aged
warrior
to
be
the
famous
ogier
the
dane
the
king
informed
ogier
of
the
events
which
had
taken
place
during
his
long
absence
that
the
line
of
charlemagne
was
extinct
that
a
new
dynasty
had
commenced
that
the
old
enemies
of
the
kingdom
the
saracens
were
still
troublesome
and
that
at
that
very
time
an
army
of
those
miscreants
was
besieging
the
city
of
chartres
to
which
he
was
about
to
repair
in
a
few
days
to
its
relief
ogier
always
inflamed
with
the
love
of
glory
offered
the
service
of
his
arm
which
the
illustrious
monarch
accepted
graciously
and
conducted
him
to
the
queen
the
astonishment
of
ogier
was
redoubled
when
he
saw
the
new
ornaments
and
of
the
ladies
still
the
beautiful
hair
which
they
built
up
on
their
foreheads
and
the
feathers
interwoven
which
waved
with
so
much
grace
gave
them
a
noble
air
that
delighted
him
his
admiration
increased
when
instead
of
the
old
empress
bertha
he
saw
a
young
queen
who
combined
a
majestic
mien
with
the
graces
of
her
time
of
life
and
manners
candid
and
charming
suited
to
attach
all
hearts
ogier
saluted
the
youthful
queen
with
a
respect
so
profound
that
many
of
the
courtiers
took
him
for
a
foreigner
or
at
least
for
some
nobleman
brought
up
at
a
distance
from
paris
who
retained
the
manners
of
what
they
called
the
old
court
when
the
queen
was
informed
by
her
husband
that
it
was
the
celebrated
ogier
the
dane
whom
he
presented
to
her
whose
memorable
exploits
she
had
often
read
in
the
chronicles
of
antiquity
her
surprise
was
extreme
which
was
increased
when
she
remarked
the
dignity
of
his
address
the
animation
and
even
the
youthfulness
of
his
countenance
this
queen
had
too
much
intelligence
to
believe
hastily
proof
alone
could
compel
her
assent
and
she
asked
him
many
questions
about
the
old
court
of
charlemagne
and
received
such
instructive
and
appropriate
answers
as
removed
every
doubt
it
is
to
the
corrections
which
ogier
was
at
that
time
enabled
to
make
to
the
popular
narratives
of
his
exploits
that
we
are
indebted
for
the
perfect

and
trustworthiness

all
the

so
often

continued
some
time
at
the
court
detained
by
the
favor
of
the
king
and
queen
but
erelong
he
had
the
pain
to
witness
the
death
of
the
king
then
it
was
that
impressed
with
all
the
perfections
which
he
had
discerned
in
the
queen
he
could
not
withhold
the
tender
homage
of
the
offer
of
his
hand
the
queen
would
perhaps
have
accepted
it
she
had
even
called
a
meeting
of
her
great
barons
to
deliberate
on
the
proposition
when
the
day
before
the
meeting
was
to
be
held
at
the
moment
when
ogier
was
kneeling
at
her
feet
she
perceived
a
crown
of
gold
which
an
invisible
hand
had
placed
on
his
brow
and
in
an
instant
a
cloud
enveloped
ogier
and
he
disappeared
forever
from
her
sight
it
was
morgana
the
fairy
whose
jealousy
was
awakened
at
what
she
beheld
who
now
resumed
her
power
and
took
him
away
to
dwell
with
her
in
the
island
of

in
company
with
the
great
king

still
lives
