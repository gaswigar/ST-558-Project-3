billy
hopped
down

as
fast
as
he

good
big
jump
down
he
came
but
not
on
the
sled
oh
no
he
came
down
hard
on
the
slide
he
bumped
his
nose
and
that
made
two
little
tears
roll
down
his
cheeks
when
he
brushed
the
tears
away
he
looked
to
see
where
the
sled
was

the
sled
went
on
down
the
hill
it
was
half
way
down
the
hill

call
and
turned
around
to

he
said
to
billy

has
fallen
off
the
sled
and
hurt
himself

bobtail
did
a
very
silly
thing
he
jumped
up
on
the
sled
to
call
to
bunny
he
jumped
up
and
the
sled
went
on
down
the
hill
it
left
bobtail
rolling
over
and
over
in
the
snow
and
he
rolled
head
first
right
into
a
bobtail
did
like
that
very
well
he
kicked
and
kicked
to
get
out
of
the
snow
he
shook
his
fur
coat
and
he
shook
his
long
ears
then
he
looked
down
the
hill
to
see
what
had
become
of
billy
billy
was
on
the
sled
and
the
sled
was
sliding
down
the
hill
it
came
to
the
pond
crack
crack
splash
splash
it
went
crack
crack
splash
splash
and
billy
slid
right
into
the
water
it
was
not
very
deep
but
it
was
very
wet
when
billy
climbed
out
on
the
bank
he
was
very
wet
too
oh
dear
me
he
said
the
water
is
cold
oh

me
said
bobtail
the
snow
is
cold
oh
dear
me
said
bunny
i
hurt
my
nose
let
run
home
to
mother
rabbit
said
billy
yes
let
run
home
so
the
three
little
rabbits
hopped
along
the
path
through
the
woods
as
fast
as
they
could
go
bobby
gray
squirrel
was
running
up
and
down
in
the
big
oak
tree
come
and
play
with
me
he
said
but
the
little
rabbits
did
not
stop
to
answer
they
hopped
along
the
path
as
fast
as
they
could
go
and
they
did
stop
once
until
they
were
safe
in
their
own
cosy
home
a
christmas
tree
i
the
little
pine
tree
stood
near
the
path
that
led
through
the
woods
in
summer
the
rabbits
often
sat
under
this
tree
to
rest
the
tree
listened
to
the
stories
they
told
of
the
good
times
they
had
together
the
birds
flew
to
its
branches
and
talked
to
each
other
about
the
things
they
had
seen
in
the
woods
bobby
gray
squirrel
and
his
brothers
often
ran
up
into
the
pine
tree
to
play
tag
but
sammy
red
squirrel
knew
something
about
this
tree
that
no
one
else
knew
he
knew
where
there
was
a
small
hole
in
one
of
the
branches
he
found
it
one
day
when
he
ran
up
into
the
tree
to
eat
a
nut
and
when
he
saw
the
hole
he
said
to
himself
that
is
a
good
place
to
hide
some
nuts
for
the
winter
the
hole
was
not
very
large
but
sammy
hid
ten
acorns
in
it
he
packed
them
in
one
by
one
last
of
all
he
put
a
piece
of
bark
in
the
hole
this
is
a
good
door
for
my
he
said
i
am
sure
no
one
will
find
these
acorns
and
no
one
did
find
them
sammy
ran
to
the
hole
very
often
and
lifted
the
door
just
a
crack
the
ten
little
acorns
were
just
where
he
had
put
them
i
will
eat
these
nuts
last
of
all
he
said
to
himself
all
through
the
fall
the
little
red
squirrel
hunted
for
nuts
under
the
trees
sometimes
he
could
not
find
any
on
the
ground
then
he
would
run
round
and
round
hunting
for
holes
where
he
had
hidden
acorns
away
if
the
holes
were
empty
sammy
knew
some
other
little
squirrel
had
been
there
before
him
and
sometimes
sammy
found
nuts
that
other
squirrels
had
stored
away
the
hunting
was
always
good
and
no
squirrel
ever
went
to
bed
hungry
but
at
last
jack
frost
came
and
covered
everything
with
snow
all
the
nuts
and
acorns
were
frozen
into
the
ground
so
the
squirrels
could
not
dig
them
out
illustration
the
squirrel
hunted
for
nuts
then
sammy
went
to
his
in
the
stone
wall
or
in
some
old
stump
at
last
it
became
very
cold
north
wind
blew
through
the
woods
the
water
in
the
little
brook
was
covered
with
ice
the
birds
tried
to
keep
warm
among
the
branches
of
the
evergreen
trees
the
rabbits
slept
in
their
warm
home
and
did
not
come
out
very
often
the
squirrels
slept
in
their
nests
and
did
not
come
out
for
days
and
days
blacky
crow
stayed
in
the
deep
woods
where
the
largest
trees
helped
to
keep
him
warm
the
ground
had
been
covered
with
snow
for
two
or
three
weeks
and
the
squirrels
and
rabbits
had
taken
long
long
naps
ii
a
few
days
before
christmas
sun
came
up
from
behind
the
hills
and
shone
brightly
all
day
long
he
melted
the
snow
in
the
warm
hollows
and
softened
the
ice
on
the
brooks
bunny
rabbit
and
his
brothers
came
out
and
hopped
around
to
find
roots
to
eat
the
squirrels
ran
up
and
down
the
trees
and
all
around
everywhere
to
find
hidden
nuts
all
at
once
bunny
rabbit
heard
a
noise
he
sat
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
held
up
his
long
ears
the
other
rabbits
listened
too
sammy
and
bobby
heard
the
noise
and
scampered
up
into
the
little
pine
tree
barked
jip
as
he
ran
through
the
woods
it
the
dog
cried
bunny
let
run
and
hide
the
little
rabbits
whirled
around
and
hopped
back
to
their
house
sammy
and
bobby
were
safe
in
the
tree
so
they
did
not
try
to
run
away
they
heard
some
one
talking
and
they
looked
to
see
who
it
was
they
saw
two
children
and
a
man
the
man
had
an
axe
in
his
hand
the
two
children
ran
along
the
path
talking
and
laughing
they
were
looking
at
all
the
evergreen
trees
this
is
a
good
one
said
the
little
boy
this
is
a
better
one
said
the
girl
and
she
pointed
right
at
the
little
pine
tree
where
sammy
and
bobby
were
hiding
they
are
going
to
cut
down
this
tree
whispered
sammy
what
shall
we
do
what
shall
we
do
but
the
man
did
not
cut
down
the
tree
he
looked
at
it
and
said
that
is
too
large
for
our
christmas
tree
we
must
find
one
that
is
much
smaller
so
the
man
and
the
two
children
went
along
the
path
into
the
woods
and
before
long
the
sound
of
the
axe
rang
out
through
the
stillness
i
never
was
so
frightened
in
my
life
said
sammy
i
thought
they
were
going
to
cut
down
this
tree
i
thought
so
too
said
bobby
but
i
was
not
frightened
i
could
jump
to
that
next
tree
it
is
not
very
far
i
know
that
said
sammy
but
i
have
a
in
this
tree
where
is
it
asked
bobby
i
wish
you
would
show
it
to
me
i
am
as
hungry
as
a
bear
so
am
i
said
sammy
let
have
dinner
now
we
will
call
it
a
christmas
dinner
the
children
said
this
would
make
a
good
christmas
tree
said
bobby
i
wonder
what
a
christmas
tree
is
like
said
sammy
as
he
ran
along
the
branch
to
find
the
bobby
followed
sammy
and
peeped
into
the
hole
where
the
ten
acorns
were
hidden
sammy
took
out
a
nut
and
bobby
took
out
a
nut
they
sat
up
on
their
hind
legs
and
nibbled
away
happily
and
as
they
nibbled
the
man
and
the
two
children
and
the
dog
came
back
through
the
woods
they
were
dragging
a
little
tree
over
the
snow
the
dog
ran
along
beside
them
barking
loudly
that
must
be
a
christmas
tree
said
bobby
i
wonder
what
they
are
going
to
do
with
it
illustration
once
bunny
rabbit
saw
a
christmas
tree
tweet
tweet
sang
a
little
sparrow
i
can
tell
you
i
saw
one
last
year
i
peeped
in
at
the
window
after
the
tree
had
been
set
up
in
the
warm
room
i
saw
many
pretty
things
hanging
on
the
branches
i
saw
the
candles
lighted
and
santa
claus
came
in
to
give
away
the
toys
to
the
happy
children
oh
it
was
pretty
but
i
like
to
see
the
tree
in
the
woods
better
then
the
little
sparrow
flew
away
and
the
two
squirrels
ate
another
nut
i
think
this
is
a
good
christmas
tree
said
bobby
yes
said
sammy
a
tree
with
a
hole
full
of
nuts
is
better
than
one
covered
with
candles
and
toys
it
is
better
for
squirrels
said
bobby
and
then
he
took
another
nut
bobtail
kite
i
north
wind
was
playing
a
game
he
was
blowing
the
dry
leaves
over
the
ground
he
piled
them
up
under
the
oak
tree
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
bend
your
head
and
bow
to
me
big
oak
tree
said
north
wind
the
oak
tree
bowed
and
bowed
its
head
north
wind
blew
on
and
on
as
he
blew
through
the
woods
every
tree
bowed
and
bowed
its
head
bobtail
and
billy
and
bunny
heard
north
wind
as
he
blew
past
their
house
oh
how
the
wind
blows
said
bunny
i
shall
stay
in
the
house
said
billy
i
do
not
like
the
wind
but
bobtail
did
not
like
to
stay
in
the
house
all
day
and
sleep
let
go
out
and
have
a
game
of
tag
he
said
to
his
two
brothers
i
will
reach
the
big
oak
tree
first
now
bunny
and
billy
always
liked
to
have
a
game
of
tag
with
bobtail
so
they
both
hopped
out
of
their
warm
house
look
out
for
me
called
north
wind
i
can
catch
you
all
went
bobtail
down
the
path
that
led
to
the
big
oak
tree
and
went
billy
and
bunny
after
him
just
as
they
came
to
the
oak
tree
bobtail
saw
the
pile
of
leaves
who
put
all
those
leaves
under
this
tree
he
said
i
did
i
did
called
north
wind
and
here
are
some
more
to
make
the
pile
larger
then
north
wind
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
blew
more
leaves
under
the
oak
tree
oh
what
fun
said
bunny
i
should
like
to
do
that
bunny
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
blew
and
blew
as
hard
as
he
could
blow
but
the
leaves
did
not
move
until
north
wind
came
to
help
him
this
is
just
the
day
to
fly
a
kite
said
bobtail
yes
said
billy
the
children
always
fly
kites
when
the
wind
blows
i
wish
we
had
a
kite
said
bunny
i
should
like
to
see
it
sail
up
in
the
air
and
over
the
trees
i
can
make
a
kite
said
bobtail
how
how
asked
both
the
other
little
rabbits
together
see
this
big
oak
leaf
said
bobtail
this
would
make
a
good
kite
if
we
had
a
long
string
i
know
where
there
is
a
string
said
bunny
one
of
the
boys
dropped
it
out
of
his
pocket
the
other
day
it
is
on
the
ground
under
the
pine
tree
i
will
get
it
for
you
so
bunny
hopped
off
and
in
a
minute
he
was
back
with
the
long
string
bobtail
tied
the
string
to
the
short
stem
of
the
oak
leaf
let
me
fly
the
kite
begged
bunny
no
let
me
said
billy
we
will
take
turns
said
bobtail
bunny
may
have
his
turn
first
so
bunny
took
hold
of
the
string
he
picked
the
kite
up
and
tossed
it
into
the
air
just
as
he
had
seen
the
boys
do
the
kite
fluttered
and
fell
to
the
ground
at
bunny
feet
this
is
not
a
good
kite
he
said
it
will
not
fly
up
into
the
air
ii
let
me
try
now
said
billy
i
know
how
to
make
a
kite
fly
so
billy
took
hold
of
the
string
then
he
climbed
up
on
the
old
stump
and
tossed
the
kite
into
the
air
look
look
he
cried
see
the
kite
fly
this
time
but
the
oak
leaf
just
fluttered
and
fluttered
and
fell
to
the
ground
at
billy
feet
something
is
the
matter
with
this
kite
said
billy
you
did
not
make
it
the
right
way
oh
yes
i
did
said
bobtail
i
will
show
you
how
to
make
it
fly
all
this
time
north
wind
had
been
very
still
he
was
watching
the
three
little
rabbits
trying
to
fly
their
kite
he
laughed
softly
to
himself
when
the
leaf
fluttered
and
fell
to
the
ground
but
north
wind
could
not
keep
still
very
long
he
saw
bobtail
take
hold
of
the
string
of
the
kite
watch
me
watch
me
said
bobtail
watch
me
watch
me
sang
north
wind
then
he
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
blew
on
the
oak
leaf
as
bobtail
gave
it
a
toss
up
up
in
the
air
flew
the
kite
and
bobtail
hopped
faster
and
faster
over
the
ground
look
look
he
cried
now
my
kite
is
going
over
the
tall
trees
bunny
and
billy
were
sitting
on
the
ground
looking
up
in
the
air
they
watched
the
kite
fly
higher
and
higher
there
it
goes
called
bobtail
and
just
then
something
else
went
too
of
course
bobtail
could
not
see
where
he
was
hopping
it
took
both
his
eyes
to
watch
his
kite
fly
higher
and
higher
so
he
did
not
see
the
big
stone
in
the
path
over
the
stone
he
fell
right
into
the
big
pile
of
leaves
under
the
oak
tree
head
first
he
went
and
in
a
second
he
was
all
covered
up
with
leaves
he
lost
hold
of
the
string
and
the
kite
flew
away
up
in
the
air
one
of
the
branches
of
the
oak
tree
caught
the
string
and
held
the
kite
fast
oh
oh
whistled
north
wind
now
it
is
my
turn
to
fly
the
kite
bobtail
did
not
say
a
word
he
picked
himself
out
of
the
big
pile
of
leaves
and
shook
his
long
ears
back
and
forth
i
do
like
to
fly
kites
he
said
let
go
home
and
take
a
nap
so
the
three
little
rabbits
hopped
back
along
the
path
through
the
woods
north
wind
puffed
out
his
cheeks
see
me
fly
the
kite
he
called
to
the
rabbits
he
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
blew
and
blew
but
the
leaf
only
fluttered
and
fluttered
because
the
branch
held
the
string
fast
north
wind
blew
and
blew
but
he
could
not
make
the
kite
fly
away
i
do
like
to
fly
kites
this
morning
he
said
i
am
going
to
pile
some
more
leaves
under
the
oak
tree
so
he
danced
over
the
ground
and
through
the
woods
singing
a
gay
little
song

he
hopped
out

it

a
warm
sunny

the

find
plenty
to
eat
too
in
the
fall
they
had
stored
away
nuts
and
acorns
in
little
holes
in
the
ground
when
jack
frost
covered
the
ground
with
snow
the
squirrels
could
not
dig
up
these
nuts
but
now
the
ground
was
soft
again
and
bobby
and
sammy
had
plenty
to
eat
bunny
and
billy
and
bobtail
saw
the
squirrels
hide
the
nuts
they
did
not
like
acorns
so
they
never
opened
the
doors
they
just
hopped
around
under
the
trees
looking
for
green
leaves
and
tender
roots
but
on
this
first
day
of
april
bunny
found
the
biggest
acorn
he
had
ever
seen
it
was
hidden
in
a
little
hole
and
he
saw
it
when
he
sat
down
to

his
breakfast

then
bunny
hopped
away
to
find
a
string
he
had
seen
under
the
oak
tree
it
was
the
same
string
they
had
used
to
fly
their
kite
the
string
had
held
the
kite
to
the
branch
for
a
long
time
then
one
day
north

the
string
the
kite
flew
up
in
the
air
and
far
away
but
the
string
dropped
to
the
ground
under
the
oak
tree
there
bunny
found
it
and
he
tied
the
string
around
the
acorn
then
he
scampered

now
sammy
was
very
fond
of

every

thought
and
thought
about

secret
i
will
ask
mrs

bunny
sat
down
under
the
maple
tree
to
wait
for
mrs
duck
he
waited
and
waited
it
was
very
warm
in
the
field
after
a
while
bunny
shut
his
eyes
and
he
fell
fast
asleep
he
slept
such
a
long
time
that
when
he
opened
his
eyes
the
sun
was
just
going
to

well

he
said

then
he
saw
sammy
red
squirrel
have

he
asked
oh

answered
sammy
she
walked
along
the
path
early
this
afternoon
the

bunny
sat
down
under
the
maple
tree
to

alone
he
had
asked
billy
to
come
with
him
if

the
two
little
rabbits
sat
down
to
wait
for
mrs
duck
they
waited
and
waited
it
was
very
warm
in
the
field
after
a
while
bunny
shut
his

then
billy
shut
his
eyes
and
they
both
fell
fast

they
slept
such
a
long
time
that
when

the
next
day
the
three
little
rabbits
sat
under
the
maple
tree
to
watch
for
mrs

they
waited
and
waited
it
was
very
warm
in
the
field
after
a
while
the
three
little
rabbits
became
sleepy
then
bobtail
jumped
up
on
his
feet
and
began
to
hop
around

he
said

in
the
sun

shall
not
see
mrs
duck
when
she
walks
along

the
three
rabbits
played
tag
they
ran
round
and
round
the
maple
tree
they
ran
back
and
forth
along
the
little
path
all
at
once
bunny
heard
mrs

coming
across
the

she
was
going
to
the

mrs

road
she
went
into
the
and
hunted
around
for
something
to

she
talked
to
the

when
she
had
eaten
all
she
wanted
she
went
out
of
the
yard
and
across
the
road
then
she
walked
back
again
along
the
path
across
the
field
when
she
came
to
the
maple

the
three

until
they
came
to
the

the

in
the

was
running
over
the

and
singing
a

at
the
eggs
for
a
few
minutes
now
i
must
cover
my
eggs
up

so
mrs

sat
down
on
the
nest
and
cuddled
the
eggs
under
her
soft
warm
wings
not
one
egg
could
be
seen
and
mrs
duck
sat
so
still
that
bunny
thought
she
had
gone
to
sleep
iii
every
day
after
that
the
rabbits
went
to
visit
mrs
duck
but
they
did
not

the
next
morning

tree
fast

and
he
did
not

he
was
dreaming
of
flying
away
with
the
little
birds
he
could
fly
high
up
over
the
trees
and
over
the
houses
oh

not
like
to
think
that
these
little
ducks
could
do
something
that
he
could
not
do
i
have
four
feet
he
said
to
himself
and
they
have
only
two
i
am
sure
i
can
do
what
they
can
do
so
bunny
jumped
up
and
followed
the
ducks
along
the
path
through
the
meadow
in
a
few
minutes
they
came
to
the
brook
the
water
looked
cool
to
the
little
ducks
but
the
water
looked
very
wet
to
bunny
mrs
duck
stood
on
the
bank
for
one
minute
to
talk
to
her
ducklings
follow
me
she
said
and
do
what
i
do
swimming
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
when
i
count

we
will
all
go

together
i
think
i
will
wait
and
see
how
you
do
it
said
bunny
that
will
be
the
best
way
for
me
to
learn
so
bunny
sat
down
on
the
bank
and
the
little
ducks
stood
in
a
row
behind
their
mother
now
said
mrs
duck
one
two
three

they
all
waddled
into
the
water
paddle

mrs

all
the
little

and
they
were

the
easiest
thing
in

ii
bunny
sat
still
on
the
bank
but
he
did
not
say
a
word
he
watched
the
ducks
swimming
round
and
round
in
the
water
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
paddle
their
feet
he
said
to
himself
i
am
sure
i
can
do
that
but
i
do
wish
the
water
was
not
so
wet
are
you
afraid
to
come
in
asked
mrs
duck
are
you
afraid
to
come
in
asked
green
frog
of
course
bunny
was
afraid
but
he
did
not
like
to
say
so
at
last
he
stood
up
and
went
down
to
the
edge
of
the
brook
he
put
one
foot
in
the
water
but
he
pulled
it
out
again
very
quickly
illustration
he
put
one
foot
in
the
water
oh

he
said
the
water

so
wet
you
ca
swim
on
dry
land
said
mrs
duck
jump
in

you
will
like
it

know

in
said
green
frog
bunny
went
a
step
nearer
and
put
two
feet
in
the
water
oh
dear
he
thought
to
himself
i
never
can
learn
to
swim
i
wish
i
were
back
under
the
tree
fast
asleep
splash
splash
green
frog
jumped
into
the
water
close
to
feet
it
frightened
the
poor
little
rabbit
and
he
slipped
into
the
water
too
paddle
your
feet
paddle
your
feet
mrs
duck
called
to
him
but
of
course
bunny
did
not
know
how
to
paddle
his
feet
he
kicked
and
kicked
and
scrambled
and
splashed
around
in
the
brook
the
water
ran
into
his
eyes
and
he
could
not
see
the
water
ran
into
his
ears
and
he
could
not
hear
the
water
ran
into
his
mouth
and
he
could
not
speak
he
kicked
and
splashed
and
scrambled
until
at
last
he
felt
his
feet
touch
the
ground
then
he
scrambled
up
on
the
bank
and
threw
himself
on
the
soft
grass
you
did
not
paddle
your
feet
said
mrs
duck
watch
us
said
all
the
little
ducks
do
it
the
way
we
do
oh
oh
laughed
green
frog
do
try
it
again
it
was
the
funniest
sight
i
ever
saw
it
may
have
been
funny
for
you
said
bunny
but
it
was
not
funny
for
me
i
am
so
wet
that
i
shall
never
be
dry
again
and
i
am
afraid
i
have
spoiled
my
fur
coat
but
sun
shone
down
brightly
and
bunny
was
soon
dry
and
warm
then
he
hopped
along
home
by
the
little
path
through
the
woods
swimming
may
be
easy
for
ducks
he
said
to
himself
and
flying
may
be
easy
for
birds
rabbits
and
squirrels
can
run
and
hop
and
jump
and
that
is
easy
for
them
the
clover
patch
i
it
was
a
lovely
day
in
june
bunny
had
been
playing
all
the
morning
with
billy
and
bobtail
they
had
played
tag
and
and
ever
so
many
other
games
at
last
they
were
all
tired
and
hungry
i
know
where
there
is
a
great
big
patch
of
clover
said
bunny
oh
bunny
begged
bobtail
show
us
where
it
is
i
have
not
had
a
taste
of
clover
for
ever
so
long
i
like
clover
too
said
billy
is
it
very
far
from
here
oh
no
said
bunny
it
is
down
beside
the
brook
the
three
little
rabbits
hopped
off
to
find
the
big
patch
of
clover
they
hopped
down
to
the
brook
but
they
could
not
see
any
clover
there
perhaps
it
was
in
the
meadow
said
billy
the
brook
runs
through
the
meadow
yes
said
bobtail
and
then
it
runs
through
the
woods
clover
would
not
grow
under
the
trees
said
bunny
it
grows
in
the
fields
where
the
sun
shines
the
sun
shines
in
the
meadow
said
billy
let
go
down
there
and
look
for
the
clover
patch
so
the
three
little
rabbits
hopped
off
through
the
field
they
hopped
along
beside
the
brook
all
the
way
oh
look
said
bunny
see
the
fishes
swimming
in
the
water
billy
hopped
very
close
to
the
brook
splash
splash
went
something
right
under
his
feet
billy
hopped
back
and
looked
all
around
to
see
what
had
happened
what
was
that
he
asked
that
was
old
green
frog
said
bunny
there
he
is
now
sitting
on
a
rock
laughing
at
you
ho
ho
laughed
green
frog
i
frightened
you
that
time
i
frightened
you
too
said
billy
that
was
why
you
jumped
into
the
water
well
said
green
frog
you
almost
hopped
on
my
back
of
course
i
was
frightened
i
jumped
into
the
water
without
looking
to
see
what
was
the
matter
come
come
said
bunny
we
must
find
that
clover
patch
i
am
as
hungry
as
a
bear
so
the
three
little
rabbits
hopped
off
across
the
meadow
they
could
not
hop
so
near
the
brook
now
because
the
ground
was
soft
and
wet
and
the
rabbits
did
not
like
to
wet
their
feet
they
hopped
along
and
at
last
bunny
called
out
here
it
is
here
it
is
billy
and
bobtail
hopped
up
close
to
bunny
sure
enough
there
was
the
biggest
patch
of
clover
they
had
ever
seen
and
how
green
every
leaf
was
the
clover
was
all
in
blossom
too
the
white
blossoms
held
their
heads
up
to
the
sun
the
sun
smiled
to
see
the
pretty
white
flowers
among
the
green
leaves
many
bees
were
flying
over
the
clover
patch
they
were
asking
the
blossoms
for
nectar
to
make
sweet
honey
buzz
buzz
sang
the
bees
as
they
flew
from
flower
to
flower
ii
bunny
and
billy
and
bobtail
began
to
nibble
the
greenest
leaves
they
nibbled
and
nibbled

plenty
of

steps
to
rub
his
poor
little
nose
mother
rabbit
saw
him
coming
and

said
mother
rabbit
billy
put
some
dirt
on
his
nose
and
the
pain
soon
went
away
then
mother
rabbit
took
him
to
a
place
where
the
grass
was
tender
he
ate
all
the
dinner
he
wanted
and
then
went
home
to
take
a
nap
bunny
and
bobtail
ate
their
dinner
in
the
meadow
the
clover
was
so
sweet
and
tender
that
they
wanted
to
eat
it
all
they
nibbled
and
nibbled
and
nibbled
but
they
were
both
very
careful
not
to
nibble
any
of
the
blossoms
where
the
bees
were
gathering
honey
moving
day
i
it
was
warm
and
sunny
in
the
meadows
it
was
warm
and
sunny
in
the
fields
but
in
the
woods
it
was
cool
and
shady
under
the
pine
trees
the
red
squirrels
had
been
playing
all
the
morning
they
had
chased
each
other
up
and
down
the
trees
and
along
the
little
path
now
sammy
was
sitting
on
the
branch
of
a
pine
tree
resting
all
at
once
he
heard
a
noise
over
in
the
field
it
was
a
very
loud
noise
and
he
wondered
what
it
could
be
he
could
not
see
the
field
from
the
tree
where
he
was
sitting
so
he
ran
down
to
the
ground
and
skipped
along
to
the
old
stone
wall
whirr
whirr
whirr
the
noise
came
nearer
and
nearer
oh

me
said
sammy
i

what
that

cutting
the
grass
in
the
field
now

the
families
that

out
sammy
sat
still
and
watched
to
who
would
be
the
first
to
move
he
had
not
been
sitting
on
the
wall
very
long
when
he
saw
the
whole
rabbit
family
coming
out
of
the

bunny
and
bobtail
and
billy
hopped
and
skipped
along
they
hopped
ahead
of
father
rabbit
along
the
little
path
that
led
through
the
woods
when
they
came
to
the

they
saw

until

back
to
our
home
in

sunny
field
said
mrs

then
she
shook
her

a
tear
from
her
eye

be
very
lonely
here

said
mrs

as
she
wiped
another
tear
out
of
her
eye
but
i

sammy
sat
on
the
wall
and
watched
the
mice
he
saw
them
stop
in
front
of
the
hole
and
peep
into
it
then
he
saw
mr
mouse
go
in
head

and
all
that
house

not
hear
what
he
said
mrs
mouse
and
the
little
mice
were
peeping
into
the
hole
and
they
did
not
hear

he
said
in
a
minute
sammy
heard
mr
mouse
call
to
his
family
to
follow
him
mrs
mouse
picked
up
the
bag
and
started
into
the
hole

the
little
mice

on
the
wall
watching
them
all
at
once
he
heard
a
noise
mrs

heard
the
noise
and
jumped
back
she
dropped
the
bag
and
it
flew
open
everything

out
on

ground
the
next
minute
mr

the
cat
now
said
sammy
she
heard
mr
mouse
squeal
when
he
came
out
of
the
hole
when
the
mice
heard
that
the
cat
was
coming
what
a
scampering
there
was
it
did
not
take
the
whole
family
of
mice
long
to
find
a
home
under
a
big
stone
sammy
jumped
off
the
wall
and
ran
up
into
the
pine
tree
the
cat
came
along
the
path
very
slowly
meow
meow
she
said
to
herself
i
must
find
something
for
breakfast
but
she
did
not
find
the
little
mice
they
were
hiding
away
under
the
big
stone
and
she
did
not
find
sammy
he
was
safe
in
the
pine
tree
of
course
she
knew
where
the
mice
were
hiding
she
saw
them
when
they
ran
into
the
hole
but
the
stone
was
too
heavy
for
her
to
move
she
sat
down
beside
the
hole
and
waited
and
waited
but
not
one
little
mouse
put
out
his
nose
at
last
the
cat
grew
tired
of
waiting
and
walked
back
along
the
path
to
the
house
she
found
a
saucer
of
milk
on
the
kitchen
floor
and
the
best
of
it
was
that
it
could
not
run
away
and
hide
like
the
mice
and
squirrels

mrs

and
all
the

their
little
yellow
feet
were
black
with
mud
but
they
liked
it
sun
looked
down
and
smiled
at
them
he
smiled
his
brightest
smile
then
a
cloud
came
and
hid
the
sun
a
gentle
wind
began
to
blow
over
the
tall
grass
in
the
field
bow
your
heads
the
wind
said
to
the
flowers
and
grass
then
the
wind
puffed
out
its
cheeks
and
blew
harder
it
rushed
along
to
the
woods
bow
your
heads
it
said
to
the
pine
trees
and
the
oak
trees
they
bowed
their
heads
and
waved
their
branches
to

fro

harder
and
the
clouds
sailed
faster
and
faster
across
the
sky

barn
until

i

the
robin
flew
to
the
woods
and
the
ducks
went
back
to
the
barn
sammy
red
squirrel
saw
the
shower
coming
and
he
scampered
home
as
fast
as
he
could
go
billy
and
bobtail
were
playing
in
their
yard
when
the
wind
rushed
by
and
called
to
them
run
in
little
rabbits
said
the
wind
i
am
bringing
a
shower
run
in
or
you
will
get
your
fur
coats
wet
so
billy
and
bobtail
hopped
into
the
house
and
curled
up
to
take
a
nap
until
the
shower
was
over
ii
the
wind
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
blew
harder
and
harder
the
clouds
sailed
across
the
sky
faster
and
faster
it
was
almost
as
dark
as
night
and
bunny
slept
on
under
the
big
oak
tree
patter
patter
patter
the
rain
drops
fell
on
the
oak
leaves
easter
and
faster
they
fell
in
a
few
minutes
the
leaves
were
wet
then
the
water
began
to
fall
down
on
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
one
great
big
drop
fell
on
bunny
nose
then
another
fell
on
his
ear
he
waked
up
with
a
start
what
is
the
matter
he
said
what
is
the
matter
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
then
he
knew
what
was
the
matter
oh
dear
me
he
said
to
himself
robin
redbreast
has
her
wish
at
last
it
is
raining
hard
faster
and
faster
the
rain
drops
fell
from
the
black
clouds
the
ground
was
soon
wet
under
the
oak
tree
and
bunny
was
wet
too
but
he
could
not
go
home
he
knew
better
than
to
leave
the
oak
tree
and
skip
out
into
the
field
so
he
curled
himself
up
in
a
very
tiny
ball
and
waited
for
the
shower
to
be
over
it
grew
lighter
and
lighter
the
wind
stopped
blowing
and
at
last
sun
peeped
out
from
behind
the
cloud
he
looked
right
down
on
bunny
and
laughed
to
see
how
he
was
rolled
up
in
such
a
tiny
ball
cheer
up
cheer
up
sang
robin
redbreast
that
was
a
fine

jumped
up
and
shook
himself
he
was
just
as
wet
as
he
could
be
his
feet
were
wet
his
back
was
wet
and
his
nice
long
ears
were
wet
he
jumped
up
and
shook
himself
then
he
started
off
toward
home
on
his
way

met
mrs

and
all
the
little
ducks
they
were
going
to
the
brook
to
have
a
swim
that
was
a
fine
rain
mrs
duck
called
to
bunny
just
see
how
the
flowers
hold
up
their
heads
but
bunny
did
not
look
at
the
flowers
he
could
not
see
why
anything
liked
to
be
wet
that
was
a
fine
rain
said
mrs

again
that

a
fine

sammy
watched
the
sparrows
flying
until
they
were
out
of
sight
i
know

could
fly
he
said
to
himself
again
if
i
had
some
wings
perhaps
i
could
make
some
wings
he
thought
just
then
something
hit
sammy
on
the
head
he
looked
up
to
see
what
it
was
and
there
at
his
feet
lay
an
oak
leaf
he
looked
up
in
the
top
of
the
tree
west
wind
flew
by
and
shook
the
branches
of
the
tree
very
gently
and
another
leaf
floated
softly
down
to
the
ground
beside
its
brother
sammy
sat
there
watching
the
leaves
for
a
few
minutes
then
he
jumped
up
and
clapped
his
hands
i
know
what
i
can
do
he
said
i
can
make
some
wings
for
myself
out
of
those
oak
leaves
i
will
ask
all
the
other
squirrels
to
come
and
watch
me
fly
sammy
hunted
on
the
ground
until
he
found
two
very
large
oak
leaves
i
can
hold
them
out
with
my
front
paws
he
said
i
think
they
will
look
just
like
wings
sammy
put
the
two
leaves
on
the
ground
and
covered
them
with
a
stone
he
was
not
going
to
let
west
wind
carry
them
away
then
he
scampered
off
to
tell
all
the
other
squirrels
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
told
all
the
red
squirrels
first
he
told
them
he
was
going
to
fly
from
the
big
oak
tree
if
you
wish
to
see
me
fly
he
said
you
must
be
at
the
tree
in
a
few
minutes
all
the
red
squirrels
scampered
off
to
get
the
best
seats
among
the
branches
of
the
oak
tree
sammy
saw
bobby
gray
squirrel
and
told
him
to
ask
all
the
gray
squirrels
to
come
and
see
him
fly
then
sammy
found
bunny
rabbit
when
bunny
heard
what
sammy
was
going
to
do
he
wanted
to
try
to
fly
too
you
are
much
too
large
for
my
wings
said
sammy
you
would
have
to
go
to
man
garden
and
ask
him
for
some
of
the
leaves
from
the
rhubarb
plants
blacky
crow
was
flying
over
the
field
he
heard
sammy
tell
bunny
that
he
was
going
to
fly
ho
ho
he
laughed
i
should
like
to
see
sammy
fly
with
those
wings
i
will
fly
to
the
oak
tree
this
very
minute
as
he
flew
over
the
meadow
he
saw
the
sparrows
and
told
them
where
he
was
going
they
wanted
to
go
too
every
one
wanted
to
go
and
watch
sammy
fly
ii
when
they
were
all
seated
sammy
picked
up
the
two
leaves
he
had
found
and
skipped
gaily
up
the
tree
he
ran
up
the
tree
and
out
on
one
of
the
longest
branches
now
watch
me
he
called
to
all
his
friends
see
me
fly
just
like
a
bird
sammy
took
one
leaf
in
each
of
his
front
paws
and
held
them
out
as
far
as
he
could
he
stood
on
the
very
end
of
the
branch
for
just
one
minute
he
saw
that
every
one
was
watching
him
you
must
flap
your
wings
called
blacky
crow
hop
off
the
branch
called
one
of
the
sparrows
so
sammy
flapped
his
wings
and
then
he
hopped
off
the
branch
but
oh
dear
me
the
wings
would
not
hold
sammy
up
in
the
air
sammy
forgot
to
hold
his
wings
out
straight
and
they
hung
down
at
his
side
without
a
flutter
and
down
to
the
ground
sammy
fell
illustration
down
to
the
ground
sammy
fell
bump
he
came
down
at
the
foot
of
the
oak
tree
he
almost
fell
on
top
of
bunny
rabbit
but
bunny
saw
him
coming
and
jumped
out
of
the
way
just
in
time
sammy
lay
very
still
where
he
had
fallen
all
the
squirrels
ran
down
to
see
if
he
had
hurt
himself
bobby
gray
squirrel
ran
to
pick
the
fallen
bird
up
from
the
ground
sammy
had
given
his
nose
such
a
bump
that
it
was
all
black
and
blue
he
had
hurt
his
paw
and
his
wings
were
all
crushed
and
broken
sammy
rubbed
his
nose
and
then
he
looked
at
his
friends
i
do
believe
oak
leaves
make
good
wings
he
said
no
said
the
tiniest
sparrow
the
best
wings
are
made
of
feathers
caw
caw
said
blacky
crow
my
wings
are
made
of
feathers
see
how
i
can
fly
then
blacky
crow
flapped
his
big
wings
and
flew
away
the
sparrows
flew
away
too
all
the
squirrels
scampered
off
to
hunt
for
nuts
and
the
rabbits
went
back
to
their
home
to
take
a
nap
sammy
was
left
sitting
alone
on
the
old
stone
wall
every
few
minutes
he
rubbed
his
poor
little
nose
and
as
he
rubbed
his
nose
he
thought
flying
may
be
fun
for
birds
and
swimming
may
be
fun
for
ducks
but
running
and
jumping
among
the
branches
of
the
big
oak
tree
is
more
fun
for
squirrels
the
cabbage
patch
i
oh
dear
me
said
billy
i
am
so
hungry
i
wish
i
could
find
something
good
to

big
cabbage

said
bunny
where
where
asked
billy
where
where

bunny
and

said
bunny

not
very
far
just
down
in
man
garden
i
think

will
stay
here
said
billy
this
clover
is
very
good
so
billy
stayed
and
ate
the
clover
but
bobtail
and
bunny
hopped
off
down
the
road
they
hopped
along
the
road
until
they
came
to
man
barn
then
they
stopped
to
listen
bunny
sat
up
straight
and
held
up
his
long
ears
bobtail
sat
up
straight
and
held
up
his
long
ears
they
listened
and
listened
but
they
did
not
hear
a
sound
i
think
jip

asleep
in
the
house
said
bunny
i
think

eating
his
dinner
said
bobtail
let
hurry
said
bunny
we
can
reach
the
garden
without
any
one
seeing
us
i
am
sure
so
the
two
little
rabbits
laid
their
ears
down
on
their
heads
and
hopped
away
they
hopped
behind
the
barn
rooster
saw
them
coming
he
said
who
are
you
where
are
you
going
in
such
a
hurry
we
are
going
to
the
garden
to
get
our
dinner
said
bunny
man
never
lets
me
go
to
the
garden
said
rooster
man
never
lets
me
go
to
the
garden
if
he
knows
about
it
laughed
bunny
said
the
rooster
as
he
flapped
his
wings
and
flew
up
on
the
fence
please
do
not
make
so
much
noise
begged
bobtail
man
will
hear
you
and
come
out
to
see
what
is
the
matter
but
the
rooster
just
flapped
his
big
wings
and
crowed
again
come
said
bunny
this
is
no
place
for
us
let
hop
into
the
garden
and
get
some
cabbage
ii
the
two
rabbits
hopped
off
across
the
yard
and
into
the
garden
there
they
found
the
biggest
cabbages
they
had
ever
seen
there
were
rows
and
rows
of
them
they
were
great
big
green
cabbages
how
good
they
did
look
to
the
hungry
little
rabbits
i
aim
going
to
eat
this
one
said
bunny
and
he
stopped
at
a
big
big
cabbage
at
the
end
of
one
long
row
bobtail
picked
out
a
big
one
for
himself
and
began
to
nibble
the
sweet
leaves
nibble
nibble
nibble
not
a
word
did
the
little
rabbits
speak
they
could
not
talk
they
were
so
busy
eating
that
they
could
not
say
a
word
nibble
nibble
nibble
how
still
it
was
in
the
garden
bunny
heard
the
bees
humming
as
they
flew
among
the
flowers
once
blacky
crow
flew
over
and
called
to
the
rabbits
but
he
did
not
fly
down
to
the
garden
there
was
nothing
there
for
him
to
eat
now
he
liked
the
corn
when
it
had
just
peeped
out
of
the
ground
then
it
was
tender
and
sweet
and
he
often
pulled
it
up
for
his
dinner
nibble
nibble
nibble
how
still
it
was
everywhere
then
all
at
once
there
was
a
noise
it
was
a
noise
the
rabbits
knew
too
well
said
jip
as
he
bounded
across
the
field
i
think
some
one
is
in
my
master
garden
bunny
and
bobtail
knew
who
was
coming
they
did
not
have
to
wait
and
see
off
through
the
garden
they
hopped
they
hopped
so
fast
that
they
were
soon
out
of
sight
but
jip
knew
where
they
had
gone
and
he
ran
after
them
barking
louder
and
louder
at
every
step
oh
dear
me
cried
bobtail
what
shall
we
do
jip
will
catch
us
before
we
reach
home
follow
me
said
bunny
i
know
where
there
is
a
hole
big
enough
for
both
of
us
to
hide
so
bobtail
followed
bunny
they
hopped
across
the
field
and
into
the
woods
said
jip
i
am
going
to
catch
you
this
time
and
then
all
at
once
jip
could
not
see
the
rabbits
anywhere
they
had
hopped
into
a
hole
under
the
big
rock
at
the
foot
of
the
oak
tree
they
hopped
into
the
hole
and
then
they
were
safe
jip
could
not
reach
them
he
sat
down
beside
the
hole
to
wait
until
they
came
out
but
they
were
too
wise
to
come
out
iii
jip
waited
and
waited
and
the
rabbits
waited
and
waited
too
at
last
jip
grew
tired
of
watching
the
hole
and
ran
off
home
then
the
two
rabbits
knew
it
was
safe
for
them
to
go
home
too
bunny
put
his
nose
out
and
looked
around
there
was
no
one
in
sight
i
am
going
now
he
said
to
bobtail
jip
has
gone
away
and
then
bunny
started
to
get
out
of
the
hole
he
put
out
his
head
but
he
could
not
get
any
farther
what
is
the
matter
what
are
you
waiting
for
is
jip
coming
back
asked
bobtail
but
bunny
did
not
answer
he
just
kept
on
wiggling
and
twisting
he
twisted
and
wiggled
twisted
and
wiggled
but
he
could
not
get
out
of
that
hole
at
last
he
pulled
his
head
back
through
the
hole
then
he
sat
down
and
looked
at
bobtail
what
shall
we
do
he
said
the
hole
has
grown
small
since
we
came
through
it
perhaps
i
can
get
out
said
bobtail
let
me
try
so
bobtail
put
his
head
out
and
then
he
hopped
out
the
rest
of
the
way
i
out
he
called
to
bunny
you
can
get
out
i
am
sure
bobtail
hopped
off
home
leaving
bunny
to
get
out
the
best
way
he
could
of
course
bunny
got
out
but
he
scratched
his
poor
little
nose
and
he
scratched
his
back
he
hurt
his
long
ears
and
he
hurt
his
foot
but
he
did
get
out
at
last
and
when
he
was
safe
on
the
outside
of
the
hole
he
turned
around
and
looked
at
it
i
never
go
in
there
again
he
said
as
he
rubbed
his
nose
i
thought
it
was
a
big
hole
but
i
must
be
bigger
than
the
hole
then
bunny
hopped
off
home
mother
rabbit
was
standing
at
the
door
watching
for
him
bobtail
and
billy
were
watching
too
how
did
you
get
out
of
the
hole
they
asked
this
is
the
way
i
got
out
said
bunny
and
he
pointed
to
his
poor
little
scratched
nose
when
mother
rabbit
saw
that
bunny
had
hurt
himself
she
took
him
into
the
house
she
gave
him
some
hot
cabbage
soup
then
she
wrapped
his
nose
up
in
flannel
and
made
him
stay
in
bed
a
whole
day
until
he
was
all
well
again
illustration
she
wrapped
his
nose
up
in
flannel
the
white
rabbit
i
it
was
a
warm
summer
day
bunny
and
billy
were
over
in
the
meadow
eating
clover
mother
rabbit
and
bobtail
were
in
the
garden
eating
cabbage
billy
was
fond
of
cabbage
too
but
the
garden
was
far
away
across
the
field
and
over
the
other
side
of
the
road
so
billy
ate
clover
in
the
meadow
bunny
had
eaten
cabbage
the
day
before
so
he
ate
clover
in
the
meadow
with
billy
the
two
little
rabbits
nibbled
at
the
tender
leaves
i
have
had
enough
to
last
me
all
day
said
bunny
now
let
go
and
play
oh
no
said
billy
i
am
going
home
and
take
a
nap
oh
do
come
and
play
with
me
said
bunny
but
billy
only
shook
his
head
and
hopped
off
toward
home
bunny
looked
around
to
see
if
there
was
any
one
to
play
with
he
could
not
see
any
of
his
friends
i
think
i
will
go
over
to
the
garden
and
find
mother
and
bobtail
he
said
to
himself
now
when
bunny
thought
of
anything
he
always
did
it
the
very
next
minute
so
he
hopped
off
as
fast
he
could
go
he
hopped
across
the
field
and
across
the
road
when
he
came
to
the
barn
he
stopped
to
see
if
man
or
jip
were
anywhere
in
sight
called
the
rooster
who
was
sitting
on
the
fence
illustration
called
the
rooster
where
are
you
going
so
fast
this
bright
day
i
am
going
to
the
garden
again
said
bunny
mother
and
bobtail
are
there
eating
cabbage
bunny
hopped
along
past
the
fence
and
into
the
orchard
all
at
once
he
stopped
he
saw
something
in
the
grass
ahead
of
him
it
was
white
and
round
and
furry
and
it
had
two
long
ears
just
like
his
own
bunny
stood
very
still
and
looked
and
looked
that
must
be
a
snow
rabbit
he
said
to
himself
but
i
never
saw
a
snow
rabbit
in
the
summer
i
am
sure
this
hot
sun
would
melt
the
snow
just
then
the
white
rabbit
saw
bunny
who
are
you
he
asked
i
never
saw
you
before
i
never
saw
you
said
bunny
where
did
you
come
from
i
live
in
a
little
house
near
the
barn
said
the
white
rabbit
jack
left
the
gate
open
this
morning
when
he
fed
me
and
so
i
thought
i
would
take
a
walk
do
you
like
to
live
in
a
little
house
asked
bunny
oh
yes
answered
the
white
rabbit
i
always
have
something
to
eat
and
i
am
never
cold
and
when
jack
forgets
to
close
the
gate
i
have
a
good
play
in
the
field
i
live
in
the
woods
said
bunny
my
door
is
never
closed
and
i
can
run
out
any
time
i
wish
but
sometimes
i
am
hungry
and
sometimes
i
am
cold
come
and
live
with
me
said
the
white
rabbit
there
is
room
enough
in
my
house
for
two
now
bunny
knew
he
would
not
like
to
live
in
a
house
all
the
time
but
he
thought
he
might
go
and
visit
the
white
rabbit
so
bunny
and
whitie
as
bunny
called
him
hopped
off
toward
the
barn
that
is
my
home
said
the
white
rabbit
and
he
pointed
to
a
little
house
under
the
apple
tree
there
was
a
yard
in
front
of
the
house
and
there
was
a
fence
around
the
yard
a
fence
with
a
gate
that
could
be
shut
and
locked
bunny
saw
the
house
and
he
hopped
along
after
whitie
but
he
was
frightened
he
had
never
been
so
near
the
barn
before
what
if
man
or
jip
should
see
him
ii
at
last
they
reached
whitie
house
and
the
two
little
rabbits
hopped
through
the
gate
oh
see
these
cabbage
leaves
said
whitie
jack
left
them
here
for
my
dinner
but
bunny
did
not
look
at
the
cabbage
leaves
for
just
at
that
moment
he
heard
jip
barking
and
then
he
heard
jack
talking
to
the
dog
poor
bunny
heart
began
to
beat
very
fast
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
he
said
jack
and
jip
will
not
hurt
you
said
whitie
i
think
jack
is
coming
to
close
the
gate
bunny
hid
himself
in
one
corner
of
the
house
and
held
his
breath
for
fear
jack
would
see
him
why
whitie
bunny
heard
jack
say
i
left
your
gate
open
this
morning
i
must
close
it
now
or
you
will
be
taking
a
walk
in
the
garden
jack
closed
the

and

was
caught
when

gone
away
whitie
called
to
bunny
to
come
out
in
the
yard
come
and
eat
some
of
these
good
cabbage
leaves
he
said
but
bunny
could
not
eat
he
could
only
sit
and
look
at
the
closed
gate
i
want
to
go
home
he
said
to
whitie
i
do

yard
all
the
time
but
you
will
never
be

here
said
whitie
come
and
eat
something
now
bunny
was
not
hungry
he
could
not
eat
all
day
long
he
sat
in
the
house
he
wondered
what
bobtail
and
billy
were
doing
he
wondered
if
mother
rabbit
was
hunting
for
him
just
before
dark
he
heard
jack
coming
to
see
whitie
again
he
did
not
hear
jip
barking
perhaps
jack
is
alone
bunny
if
he
is
i
think
i
can
get
away
he
sat
very
still
and
listened
then
he
peeped
out
and
saw
jack
coming
across
the
grass
he
was
all
alone
the
dog
was
not
running
along
beside
him
bunny
turned
around
and
looked
at
whitie
he
said
i
am
going
to
hop
out
when
jack
opens
the
gate
you
have
a
very
good
home
here
but
i
like
my
home
in
the
woods
much
better
sometime
when
you
run
away
come
and
see
me
just
then
jack
opened
the
gate
and
out
jumped
bunny
jack
was
so
frightened
that
he
dropped
whitie
supper
on
the
ground
he
looked
around
to
see
what
had
flashed
by
him
so
quickly
but
bunny
was
out
of
sight
he
did
not
stop
or
look
around
until
he
was
safe
in
his
own
home
where
have
you
been
asked
mother
rabbit
i
thought
you
were
lost
i
thought
so
too
said
bunny
i
went
to
visit
the
white
rabbit
who
lives
in
a
little
house
under
the
apple
tree
and
then
jack
came
and
shut
the
gate
and
i
could
not
get
away
oh
bunny
bunny
said
mother
rabbit
i
thought
you
were
too
wise
to
get
caught
in
a
trap
i
am
now
bunny
answered
and
he
ran
out
to
have
a
game
of
tag
with
billy
and
bobtail
teddy
bear
i
teddy
bear
lay
on
the
grass
in
the
meadow
he
lay
there
all
day
and
he
lay
there
all
night
baby
may
had
dropped
him
there
and
forgotten
all
about
him
so
the
little
brown
bear
lay
on
the
soft
grass
in
the
meadow
blacky
crow
flew
over
the
meadow
and
called
to
the
bear
caw

the
playroom
with
the
rest
of
the
toys

course
teddy
did
like
to
stay
in

teddy
stared
at
the
duck
with
his
little
black
eyes
but
he

stared
at
jip
with
his
little
black
eyes
but
he
did
not
say
a
word
i
am
sure
he
wished
the
dog
would
run
away
and
not
talk
to
him
but
jip
wanted
to
play
he
thought
it
was

it
was
fun
to
pick
him
up
and
toss
him
into
the
air
it
was
fun
to
hide
him
where
may

not
find
him
jip
picked
teddy
up
in
his
mouth
and
ran
along
through
the
meadow
he
ran
through
the
meadow
and
into
the
woods
he
said
when
jip
opened
his
mouth
to
bark
teddy
hopped
out
and
fell
to
the
ground
jip
picked
him
up
again
he
tossed
him
up
in
the
air
and
then
caught
him
in
his
mouth
he
shook
him
and

him
but
teddy
did
not

a
word
then
jip
started
along
the
path
in
the
woods
i
am
going
to
hide
teddy
where

never
find
him
he
said
to
himself
then
i
can
have
him
to
play
with

day
but
the
next
minute
jip
forgot
all
about
teddy
bear
because
he
saw
bobby
gray
squirrel
bobby
gray
squirrel
wag
skipping
over
the
ground
hunting
for
nuts
jip
liked
to
play
tag
with
bobby
so
he
dropped
teddy
bear
and
ran
after
the
little
gray
squirrel
but
bobby
saw
the
dog
coming
and
skipped
up
into
the
oak
tree
he
sat
down
on
the
lowest
branch
and
began
to
scold
jip
chatter
chatter
chatter
he
said
why

you
run
after
me
i
had
just
found
a
nut
for
my
breakfast
said
jip
come
down
out
of
that
tree
and
play
chase
with
me
but
bobby
would
not
come
down
and
so
at
last
jip
ran
away
home
he
forgot
about
teddy
and
left
him
under
the
tree
when
jip
had
run
away
bobby
came
down
out
of
the
tree
he
saw
teddy
and
ran
over
to
speak
to
him
bobby
said
to
the
little
brown
bear
what
are
you
doing
under
this
tree
teddy
stared
at
the
squirrel
with
his
little
black
eyes
but
he
did
not
say
a
word
my
mother
taught
me
to
speak
when
i
am
spoken
to
said
bobby
but
teddy
did
not
speak
and
so
at
last
bobby
ran
away
and
left
him
ii
oh
teddy
was
so
lonely
he
wished
that
he
were
back
in
the
playroom
with
the
other
toys
he
thought
of
and
the
bright
tin
soldiers
he
thought
of
the
new
automobile
and
of
all
the
pretty
dolls
then
at
last
he
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
that
he
was
back
in
the
playroom
all
at
once
some
one
took
him
by
the
arm

bunny
shook
him
and
shook
him

but
when
bunny
heard
jip
coming
along
the
path
he
forgot
all
about
playing
he
hopped
off
down
the
path
as
fast
as
he
could
go
he
did
not
look
around
once
to
see
where
the
dog
had
gone
jack
came
along
the
path
with
jip
when
he
came
to
the
tree
he
saw
teddy
bear
lying
on
the
ground
why
teddy
he
said
how
did
you
get
away
out
here
all
alone
teddy
stared
at
jack
with
his
little
black
eyes
but
he
did
not
say
a
word
barked
jip
he
was
trying
to
tell
jack
that
he
put
teddy
under
the
tree
but
jack
did
not
listen
he
just
picked
teddy
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
back
to
the
house
he
took
the
little
brown
bear
up
to
the
playroom
may
was
sitting
on
the
floor
playing
with
her
dolls
teddy
was
so
happy
to
get
back
home
that
he
jumped
out
of
jack
arms
oh
oh
cried
may
you
dropped
poor
teddy
bear
she
picked
teddy
up
and
gave
him
a
great
bear
hug
why
did
you
run
away
from
me
she
asked
teddy
stared
at
may
with
his
little
black
eyes
but
he
did
not
say
a
word
he
just
stared
at
everything
in
the
playroom
and
thought
of
the
story
he
would
tell
his
friends
about
his
day
in
the
woods
bobby
party
i
bang
bang
bang
snap
snap
snap
all
day
long
bobby
gray
squirrel
hid
in
his
nest
because
he
did
not
like
the
noise
he
poked
his
nose
out
once
or
twice
to
see
what
was
the
matter
but
each
time
he
heard
a
loud
bang
snap
then
he
jumped
back
in
his
nest
to
hide
all
day
long
he
lay
there
and
listened
and
all
day
long
the
children
played
with
their
fourth
of
july
is
fun
for
boys
and
girls
but
it
is
not
so
much
fun
for
rabbits
and
squirrels
at
last
it
was
quiet
bobby
had
not
heard
a
sound
for
a
long
time
so
he
peeped
out
of
his
door
once
more
the
sun
was
not
shining
now
the
big
round
moon
was
looking
down
to
see
if
all
the
children
were
in
bed
he
was
looking
to
see
if
all
the
rabbits
and
squirrels
were
in
bed
too
bobby
saw
the
moon
and
then
he
skipped
back
into
his
house
once
more
oh
dear
me
he
said
to
himself
i
am
hungry
but
i
must
wait
until
the
sun
comes
up
again
i
am
afraid
i
could
not
find
anything
to
eat
by
the
light
of
the
moon
bobby
went
to
sleep
and
the
next
time
he
opened
his
eyes
it
was
morning
he
jumped
up
and
ran
out
of
doors
he
ran
down
the
branch
of
the
oak
tree
and
off
through
the
woods
bunny
called
to
him
as
he
ran
past
the
three
rabbits
who
were
eating
clover
for
breakfast
this
is
a
good
morning
said
bobby
it
is
so
still
and
quiet
bobby
ran
on
and
on
every
few
minutes
he
stopped
to
hunt
for
some
hidden
nut
but
he
could
not
find
many
at
last
he
said
to
himself
i
am
going
to
the
orchard
to
get
an
apple
i
like
to
eat
the
seeds
i
might
find
an
apple
on
one
of
the
trees
bobby
skipped
through
the
woods
and
across
the
field
he
came
to
the
stone
wall
that
ran
along
one
side
of
the
road
bobby
jumped
up
on
the
highest
stone
to
look
around
and
see
if
any
one
were
in
sight
he
looked
up
the
road
and
he
looked
down
the
road
but
no
one
was
in
sight
he
jumped
down
from
the
wall
and
then
he
stood
still
right
at
his
feet
wag
a
paper
bag
and
the
bag
smelled
so
good
that
the
little
squirrel
stopped
to
take
another
sniff
that
smells
like
peanuts
bobby
said
to
himself
i
will
make
a
hole
in
the
bag
and
see
what
is
inside
bobby
took
hold
of
the
bag
with
his
sharp
little
teeth
and
tore
a
big
round
hole
he
tore
a
hole
big
enough
to
put
his
paw
through
and
then
he
was
just
like
little
jack
horner
he
put
in
his
thumb
and
pulled
out
a
plum
and
said
what
a
big
squirrel
am
i
he
pulled
out
the
kind
of
plum
he
liked
best
of
all
it
was
a
peanut
he
pulled
out
one
peanut
and
then
he
pulled
out
another
this
bag
is
full
of
peanuts
he
said
to
himself
there
are
so
many
here
i
can
never
eat
them
all
illustration
this
bag
is
full
of
peanuts
i
know
what
i
can
do
i
can
have
a
party
now
squirrels
must
like
to
have
parties
just
as
well
as
little
boys
and
girls
because
when
bobby
thought
of
the
party
he
jumped
up
and
down
and
clapped
his
hands
then
he
started
off
to
invite
all
the
other
gray
squirrels
but
he
stopped
when
he
reached
the
top
of
the
wall
he
had
just
thought
that
some
one
might
come
while
he
was
away
and
find
the
peanuts
i
will
hide
them
in
the
wall
he
said
to
himself
then
they
will
be
out
of
sight
so
bobby
jumped
down
again
and
began
to
carry
the
nuts
to
a
safe
place
it
took
so
long
and
bobby
worked
so
hard
that
he
had
to
go
back
home
to
take
a
nap
when
he
had
finished
ii
bobby
gray
squirrel
slept
and
slept
but
sammy
red
squirrel
was
not
asleep
he
had
been
wide
awake
all
day
he
had
seen
bobby
hiding
the
peanuts
in
the
old
stone
wall
he
was
sitting
up
in
the
maple
tree
watching
him
all
the
time
i
wonder
what
bobby
is
hiding
all
those
nuts
for
he
said
to
himself
i
think
i
will
wait
here
and
see
what
he
is
going
to
do
so
for
a
long
time
sammy
sat
still
in
the
maple
tree
watching
bobby
work
when
the
last
nut
was
hidden
bobby
skipped
off
toward
home
now
is
my
chance
said
sammy
i
am
going
to
play
a
trick
on
bobby
sammy
skipped
down
the
tree
and
ran
along
the
wall
to
the
place
where
the
nuts
were
hidden
he
took
the
nuts
out
of
their
hiding
place
and
carried
them
to
a
hole
behind
the
big
rock
it
took
a
long
time
to
do
it
but
sammy
liked
to
play
tricks
back
and
forth
he
ran
until
the
very
last
nut
was
stored
away
in
the
new
hiding
place
then
he
skipped
around
to
tell
the
red
squirrels
about
the
joke
he
had
played
on
bobby
gray
squirrel
run
to
the
maple
tree
near
the
stone
wall
said
sammy
you
will
see
what
bobby
does
when
he
finds
his
nuts
are
gone
so
the
red
squirrels
all
ran
to
the
maple
tree
to
watch
for
the
gray
squirrels
to
come
to
the
party
at
last
bobby
waked
up
and
the
minute
he
opened
his
eyes
he
thought
of
the
peanuts
he
skipped
down
the
tree
and
ran
to
tell
his
friends
about
the
party
meet
me
at
the
old
stone
wall
he
said
that
is
where
i
am
going
to
have
my
party
so
the
gray
squirrels
all
ran
along
to
the
stone
wall
the
red
squirrels
were
in
the
maple
tree
but
the
gray
squirrels
did
not
see
them
as
soon
as
bobby
came
to
the
stone
wall
all
his
friends
ran
to
meet
him

me
said
bobby

the
gray
squirrels
skipped
along
after
bobby
but
when
they
came
to
the
storehouse
they
all
stopped
and
looked
at
the
hole
not
one
peanut
could
they

i
wonder

my
nuts
said
bobby
i
thought
i
had
put
them
where
they
could
not
be
found
the
gray
squirrels
sat
down
in
a
row
and
looked
very
sad
just
then
they
heard
a
sound
up
in
the
maple
tree
they
looked
up
and
saw
all
the
red
squirrels
laughing
ho

sammy
