note
in
the
writing
of
this
english
translation
of
professor
bergson
most
important
work
i
was
helped
by
the
friendly
interest
of
professor
william
james
to
whom
i
owe
the
illumination
of
much
that
was
dark
to
me
as
well
as
the
happy
rendering
of
certain
words
and
phrases
for
which
an
english
equivalent
was
difficult
to
find
his
sympathetic
appreciation
of
professor
bergson
thought
is
well
known
and
he
has
expressed
his
admiration
for
it
in
one
of
the
chapters
of
pluralistic
it
was
his
intention
had
he
lived
to
see
the
completion
of
this
translation
himself
to
introduce
it
to
english
readers
in
a
prefatory
note
i
wish
to
thank
my
friend
george
clarke
cox
for
many
valuable
suggestions
i
have
endeavored
to
follow
the
text
as
closely
as
possible
and
at
the
same
time
to
preserve
the
living
union
of
diction
and
thought
professor
bergson
has
himself
carefully
revised
the
whole
work
we
both
of
us
wish
to
acknowledge
the
great
assistance
of
miss
millicent
murby
she
has
kindly
studied
the
translation
phrase
by
phrase
weighing
each
word
and
her
revision
has
resulted
in
many
improvements
but
above
all
we
must
express
our
acknowledgment
to
wildon
carr
the
honorary
secretary
of
the
aristotelian
society
of
london
and
the
writer
of
several
studies
of
evolution
creatrice
we
asked
him
to
be
kind
enough
to
revise
the
proofs
of
our
work
he
has
done
much
more
than
revise
them
they
have
come
from
his
hands
with
his
personal
mark
in
many
places
we
can
not
express
all
that
the
present
work
owes
to
him

introduction
the
history
of
the
evolution
of
life
incomplete
as
it
yet
is
already
reveals
to
us
how
the
intellect
has
been
formed
by
an
uninterrupted
progress
along
a
line
which
ascends
through
the
vertebrate
series
up
to
man
it
shows
us
in
the
faculty
of
understanding
an
appendage
of
the
faculty
of
acting
a
more
and
more
precise
more
and
more
complex
and
supple
adaptation
of
the
consciousness
of
living
beings
to
the
conditions
of
existence
that
are
made
for
them
hence
should
result
this
consequence
that
our
intellect
in
the
narrow
sense
of
the
word
is
intended
to
secure
the
perfect
fitting
of
our
body
to
its
environment
to
represent
the
relations
of
external
things
among
themselves
in
short
to
think
matter
such
will
indeed
be
one
of
the
conclusions
of
the
present
essay
we
shall
see
that
the
human
intellect
feels
at
home
among
inanimate
objects
more
especially
among
solids
where
our
action
finds
its
fulcrum
and
our
industry
its
tools
that
our
concepts
have
been
formed
on
the
model
of
solids
that
our
logic
is
the
logic
of
solids
that
consequently
our
intellect
triumphs
in
geometry
wherein
is
revealed
the
kinship
of
logical
thought
with
unorganized
matter
and
where
the
intellect
has
only
to
follow
its
natural
movement
after
the
lightest
possible
contact
with
experience
in
order
to
go
from
discovery
to
discovery
sure
that
experience
is
following
behind
it
and
will
justify
it
invariably
but
from
this
it
must
also
follow
that
our
thought
in
its
purely
logical
form
is
incapable
of
presenting
the
true
nature
of
life
the
full
meaning
of
the
evolutionary
movement
created
by
life
in
definite
circumstances
to
act
on
definite
things
how
can
it
embrace
life
of
which
it
is
only
an
emanation
or
an
aspect
deposited
by
the
evolutionary
movement
in
the
course
of
its
way
how
can
it
be
applied
to
the
evolutionary
movement
itself
as
well
contend
that
the
part
is
equal
to
the
whole
that
the
effect
can
reabsorb
its
cause
or
that
the
pebble
left
on
the
beach
displays
the
form
of
the
wave
that
brought
it
there
in
fact
we
do
indeed
feel
that
not
one
of
the
categories
of
our
thought
unity
multiplicity
mechanical
causality
intelligent
finality
applies
exactly
to
the
things
of
life
who
can
say
where
individuality
begins
and
ends
whether
the
living
being
is
one
or
many
whether
it
is
the
cells
which
associate
themselves
into
the
organism
or
the
organism
which
dissociates
itself
into
cells
in
vain
we
force
the
living
into
this
or
that
one
of
our
molds
all
the
molds
crack
they
are
too
narrow
above
all
too
rigid
for
what
we
try
to
put
into
them
our
reasoning
so
sure
of
itself
among
things
inert
feels
ill
at
ease
on
this
new
ground
it
would
be
difficult
to
cite
a
biological
discovery
due
to
pure
reasoning
and
most
often
when
experience
has
finally
shown
us
how
life
goes
to
work
to
obtain
a
certain
result
we
find
its
way
of
working
is
just
that
of
which
we
should
never
have
thought
yet
evolutionist
philosophy
does
not
hesitate
to
extend
to
the
things
of
life
the
same
methods
of
explanation
which
have
succeeded
in
the
case
of
unorganized
matter
it
begins
by
showing
us
in
the
intellect
a
local
effect
of
evolution
a
flame
perhaps
accidental
which
lights
up
the
coming
and
going
of
living
beings
in
the
narrow
passage
open
to
their
action
and
lo
forgetting
what
it
has
just
told
us
it
makes
of
this
lantern
glimmering
in
a
tunnel
a
sun
which
can
illuminate
the
world
boldly
it
proceeds
with
the
powers
of
conceptual
thought
alone
to
the
ideal
reconstruction
of
all
things
even
of
life
true
it
hurtles
in
its
course
against
such
formidable
difficulties
it
sees
its
logic
end
in
such
strange
contradictions
that
it
very
speedily
renounces
its
first
ambition
it
is
no
longer
reality
itself
it
says
that
it
will
reconstruct
but
only
an
imitation
of
the
real
or
rather
a
symbolical
image
the
essence
of
things
escapes
us
and
will
escape
us
always
we
move
among
relations
the
absolute
is
not
in
our
province
we
are
brought
to
a
stand
before
the
unknowable
but
for
the
human
intellect
after
too
much
pride
this
is
really
an
excess
of
humility
if
the
intellectual
form
of
the
living
being
has
been
gradually
modeled
on
the
reciprocal
actions
and
reactions
of
certain
bodies
and
their
material
environment
how
should
it
not
reveal
to
us
something
of
the
very
essence
of
which
these
bodies
are
made
action
can
not
move
in
the
unreal
a
mind
born
to
speculate
or
to
dream
i
admit
might
remain
outside
reality
might
deform
or
transform
the
real
perhaps
even
create
it
as
we
create
the
figures
of
men
and
animals
that
our
imagination
cuts
out
of
the
passing
cloud
but
an
intellect
bent
upon
the
act
to
be
performed
and
the
reaction
to
follow
feeling
its
object
so
as
to
get
its
mobile
impression
at
every
instant
is
an
intellect
that
touches
something
of
the
absolute
would
the
idea
ever
have
occurred
to
us
to
doubt
this
absolute
value
of
our
knowledge
if
philosophy
had
not
shown
us
what
contradictions
our
speculation
meets
what
it
ends
in
but
these
difficulties
and
contradictions
all
arise
from
trying
to
apply
the
usual
forms
of
our
thought
to
objects
with
which
our
industry
has
nothing
to
do
and
for
which
therefore
our
molds
are
not
made
intellectual
knowledge
in
so
far
as
it
relates
to
a
certain
aspect
of
inert
matter
ought
on
the
contrary
to
give
us
a
faithful
imprint
of
it
having
been
stereotyped
on
this
particular
object
it
becomes
relative
only
if
it
claims
such
as
it
is
to
present
to
us
life
that
is
to
say
the
maker
of
the
must
we
then
give
up
fathoming
the
depths
of
life
must
we
keep
to
that
mechanistic
idea
of
it
which
the
understanding
will
always
give
us
an
idea
necessarily
artificial
and
symbolical
since
it
makes
the
total
activity
of
life
shrink
to
the
form
of
a
certain
human
activity
which
is
only
a
partial
and
local
manifestation
of
life
a
result
or
of
the
vital
process
we
should
have
to
do
so
indeed
if
life
had
employed
all
the
psychical
potentialities
it
possesses
in
producing
pure
understandings
that
is
to
say
in
making
geometricians
but
the
line
of
evolution
that
ends
in
man
is
not
the
only
one
on
other
paths
divergent
from
it
other
forms
of
consciousness
have
been
developed
which
have
not
been
able
to
free
themselves
from
external
constraints
or
to
regain
control
over
themselves
as
the
human
intellect
has
done
but
which
none
the
less
also
express
something
that
is
immanent
and
essential
in
the
evolutionary
movement
suppose
these
other
forms
of
consciousness
brought
together
and
amalgamated
with
intellect
would
not
the
result
be
a
consciousness
as
wide
as
life
and
such
a
consciousness
turning
around
suddenly
against
the
push
of
life
which
it
feels
behind
would
have
a
vision
of
life
complete
would
it
not
even
though
the
vision
were
fleeting
it
will
be
said
that
even
so
we
do
not
transcend
our
intellect
for
it
is
still
with
our
intellect
and
through
our
intellect
that
we
see
the
other
forms
of
consciousness
and
this
would
be
right
if
we
were
pure
intellects
if
there
did
not
remain
around
our
conceptual
and
logical
thought
a
vague
nebulosity
made
of
the
very
substance
out
of
which
has
been
formed
the
luminous
nucleus
that
we
call
the
intellect
therein
reside
certain
powers
that
are
complementary
to
the
understanding
powers
of
which
we
have
only
an
indistinct
feeling
when
we
remain
shut
up
in
ourselves
but
which
will
become
clear
and
distinct
when
they
perceive
themselves
at
work
so
to
speak
in
the
evolution
of
nature
they
will
thus
learn
what
sort
of
effort
they
must
make
to
be
intensified
and
expanded
in
the
very
direction
of
life
this
amounts
to
saying
that
of
and
of
seem
to
us
inseparable
a
theory
of
life
that
is
not
accompanied
by
a
criticism
of
knowledge
is
obliged
to
accept
as
they
stand
the
concepts
which
the
understanding
puts
at
its
disposal
it
can
but
enclose
the
facts
willing
or
not
in
frames
which
it
regards
as
ultimate
it
thus
obtains
a
symbolism
which
is
convenient
perhaps
even
necessary
to
positive
science
but
not
a
direct
vision
of
its
object
on
the
other
hand
a
theory
of
knowledge
which
does
not
replace
the
intellect
in
the
general
evolution
of
life
will
teach
us
neither
how
the
frames
of
knowledge
have
been
constructed
nor
how
we
can
enlarge
or
go
beyond
them
it
is
necessary
that
these
two
inquiries
theory
of
knowledge
and
theory
of
life
should
join
each
other
and
by
a
circular
process
push
each
other
on
unceasingly
together
they
may
solve
by
a
method
more
sure
brought
nearer
to
experience
the
great
problems
that
philosophy
poses
for
if
they
should
succeed
in
their
common
enterprise
they
would
show
us
the
formation
of
the
intellect
and
thereby
the
genesis
of
that
matter
of
which
our
intellect
traces
the
general
configuration
they
would
dig
to
the
very
root
of
nature
and
of
mind
they
would
substitute
for
the
false
evolutionism
of
spencer
which
consists
in
cutting
up
present
reality
already
evolved
into
little
bits
no
less
evolved
and
then
recomposing
it
with
these
fragments
thus
positing
in
advance
everything
that
is
to
be
explained
a
true
evolutionism
in
which
reality
would
be
followed
in
its
generation
and
its
growth
but
a
philosophy
of
this
kind
will
not
be
made
in
a
day
unlike
the
philosophical
systems
properly
so
called
each
of
which
was
the
individual
work
of
a
man
of
genius
and
sprang
up
as
a
whole
to
be
taken
or
left
it
will
only
be
built
up
by
the
collective
and
progressive
effort
of
many
thinkers
of
many
observers
also
completing
correcting
and
improving
one
another
so
the
present
essay
does
not
aim
at
resolving
at
once
the
greatest
problems
it
simply
desires
to
define
the
method
and
to
permit
a
glimpse
on
some
essential
points
of
the
possibility
of
its
application
its
plan
is
traced
by
the
subject
itself
in
the
first
chapter
we
try
on
the
evolutionary
progress
the
two
garments
that
our
understanding
puts
at
our
disposal
mechanism
and
finality
we
show
that
they
do
not
fit
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
but
that
one
of
them
might
be
recut
and
resewn
and
in
this
new
form
fit
less
badly
than
the
other
in
order
to
transcend
the
point
of
view
of
the
understanding
we
try
in
our
second
chapter
to
reconstruct
the
main
lines
of
evolution
along
which
life
has
traveled
by
the
side
of
that
which
has
led
to
the
human
intellect
the
intellect
is
thus
brought
back
to
its
generating
cause
which
we
then
have
to
grasp
in
itself
and
follow
in
its
movement
it
is
an
effort
of
this
kind
that
we
attempt
incompletely
indeed
in
our
third
chapter
a
fourth
and
last
part
is
meant
to
show
how
our
understanding
itself
by
submitting
to
a
certain
discipline
might
prepare
a
philosophy
which
transcends
it
for
that
a
glance
over
the
history
of
systems
became
necessary
together
with
an
analysis
of
the
two
great
illusions
to
which
as
soon
as
it
speculates
on
reality
in
general
the
human
understanding
is
exposed

it
is
profoundly
treated
in
the
development
of
this
idea
we
agree
with
ch
dunan
on
more
than
one
point
but
the
views
we
are
presenting
on
this
matter
as
on
the
questions
attaching
to
it
are
those
that
we
expressed
long
ago
in
our
sur
les
données
immédiates
de
la
paris
one
of
the
principal
objects
of
that
essay
was
in
fact
to
show
that
the
psychical
life
is
neither
unity
nor
multiplicity
that
it
transcends
both
the
and
the
mechanism
and
finalism
having
meaning
only
where
there
is
distinct
multiplicity
spatiality
and
consequently
assemblage
of
parts
real
duration
signifies
both
undivided
continuity
and
creation
in
the
present
work
we
apply
these
same
ideas
to
life
in
general
regarded
moreover
itself
from
the
psychological
point
of
view
chapter
i
the
evolution
of
life
mechanism
and
teleology
the
existence
of
which
we
are
most
assured
and
which
we
know
best
is
unquestionably
our
own
for
of
every
other
object
we
have
notions
which
may
be
considered
external
and
superficial
whereas
of
ourselves
our
perception
is
internal
and
profound
what
then
do
we
find
in
this
privileged
case
what
is
the
precise
meaning
of
the
word
exist
let
us
recall
here
briefly
the
conclusions
of
an
earlier
work
i
find
first
of
all
that
i
pass
from
state
to
state
i
am
warm
or
cold
i
am
merry
or
sad
i
work
or
i
do
nothing
i
look
at
what
is
around
me
or
i
think
of
something
else
sensations
feelings
volitions
ideas
such
are
the
changes
into
which
my
existence
is
divided
and
which
color
it
in
turns
i
change
then
without
ceasing
but
this
is
not
saying
enough
change
is
far
more
radical
than
we
are
at
first
inclined
to
suppose
for
i
speak
of
each
of
my
states
as
if
it
formed
a
block
and
were
a
separate
whole
i
say
indeed
that
i
change
but
the
change
seems
to
me
to
reside
in
the
passage
from
one
state
to
the
next
of
each
state
taken
separately
i
am
apt
to
think
that
it
remains
the
same
during
all
the
time
that
it
prevails
nevertheless
a
slight
effort
of
attention
would
reveal
to
me
that
there
is
no
feeling
no
idea
no
volition
which
is
not
undergoing
change
every
moment
if
a
mental
state
ceased
to
vary
its
duration
would
cease
to
flow
let
us
take
the
most
stable
of
internal
states
the
visual
perception
of
a
motionless
external
object
the
object
may
remain
the
same
i
may
look
at
it
from
the
same
side
at
the
same
angle
in
the
same
light
nevertheless
the
vision
i
now
have
of
it
differs
from
that
which
i
have
just
had
even
if
only
because
the
one
is
an
instant
older
than
the
other
my
memory
is
there
which
conveys
something
of
the
past
into
the
present
my
mental
state
as
it
advances
on
the
road
of
time
is
continually
swelling
with
the
duration
which
it
accumulates
it
goes
on
increasing
rolling
upon
itself
as
a
snowball
on
the
snow
still
more
is
this
the
case
with
states
more
deeply
internal
such
as
sensations
feelings
desires
which
do
not
correspond
like
a
simple
visual
perception
to
an
unvarying
external
object
but
it
is
expedient
to
disregard
this
uninterrupted
change
and
to
notice
it
only
when
it
becomes
sufficient
to
impress
a
new
attitude
on
the
body
a
new
direction
on
the
attention
then
and
then
only
we
find
that
our
state
has
changed
the
truth
is
that
we
change
without
ceasing
and
that
the
state
itself
is
nothing
but
change
this
amounts
to
saying
that
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
passing
from
one
state
to
another
and
persisting
in
the
same
state
if
the
state
which
remains
the
same
is
more
varied
than
we
think
on
the
other
hand
the
passing
from
one
state
to
another
resembles
more
than
we
imagine
a
single
state
being
prolonged
the
transition
is
continuous
but
just
because
we
close
our
eyes
to
the
unceasing
variation
of
every
psychical
state
we
are
obliged
when
the
change
has
become
so
considerable
as
to
force
itself
on
our
attention
to
speak
as
if
a
new
state
were
placed
alongside
the
previous
one
of
this
new
state
we
assume
that
it
remains
unvarying
in
its
turn
and
so
on
endlessly
the
apparent
discontinuity
of
the
psychical
life
is
then
due
to
our
attention
being
fixed
on
it
by
a
series
of
separate
acts
actually
there
is
only
a
gentle
slope
but
in
following
the
broken
line
of
our
acts
of
attention
we
think
we
perceive
separate
steps
true
our
psychic
life
is
full
of
the
unforeseen
a
thousand
incidents
arise
which
seem
to
be
cut
off
from
those
which
precede
them
and
to
be
disconnected
from
those
which
follow
discontinuous
though
they
appear
however
in
point
of
fact
they
stand
out
against
the
continuity
of
a
background
on
which
they
are
designed
and
to
which
indeed
they
owe
the
intervals
that
separate
them
they
are
the
beats
of
the
drum
which
break
forth
here
and
there
in
the
symphony
our
attention
fixes
on
them
because
they
interest
it
more
but
each
of
them
is
borne
by
the
fluid
mass
of
our
whole
psychical
existence
each
is
only
the
best
illuminated
point
of
a
moving
zone
which
comprises
all
that
we
feel
or
think
or
will
all
in
short
that
we
are
at
any
given
moment
it
is
this
entire
zone
which
in
reality
makes
up
our
state
now
states
thus
defined
can
not
be
regarded
as
distinct
elements
they
continue
each
other
in
an
endless
flow
but
as
our
attention
has
distinguished
and
separated
them
artificially
it
is
obliged
next
to
reunite
them
by
an
artificial
bond
it
imagines
therefore
a
formless
indifferent
and
unchangeable
on
which
it
threads
the
psychic
states
which
it
has
set
up
as
independent
entities
instead
of
a
flux
of
fleeting
shades
merging
into
each
other
it
perceives
distinct
and
so
to
speak
colors
set
side
by
side
like
the
beads
of
a
necklace
it
must
perforce
then
suppose
a
thread
also
itself
solid
to
hold
the
beads
together
but
if
this
colorless
substratum
is
perpetually
colored
by
that
which
covers
it
it
is
for
us
in
its
indeterminateness
as
if
it
did
not
exist
since
we
only
perceive
what
is
colored
or
in
other
words
psychic
states
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
substratum
has
no
reality
it
is
merely
a
symbol
intended
to
recall
unceasingly
to
our
consciousness
the
artificial
character
of
the
process
by
which
the
attention
places
states
side
by
side
where
actually
there
is
a
continuity
which
unfolds
if
our
existence
were
composed
of
separate
states
with
an
impassive
ego
to
unite
them
for
us
there
would
be
no
duration
for
an
ego
which
does
not
change
does
not
and
a
psychic
state
which
remains
the
same
so
long
as
it
is
not
replaced
by
the
following
state
does
not
either
vain
therefore
is
the
attempt
to
range
such
states
beside
each
other
on
the
ego
supposed
to
sustain
them
never
can
these
solids
strung
upon
a
solid
make
up
that
duration
which
flows
what
we
actually
obtain
in
this
way
is
an
artificial
imitation
of
the
internal
life
a
static
equivalent
which
will
lend
itself
better
to
the
requirements
of
logic
and
language
just
because
we
have
eliminated
from
it
the
element
of
real
time
but
as
regards
the
psychical
life
unfolding
beneath
the
symbols
which
conceal
it
we
readily
perceive
that
time
is
just
the
stuff
it
is
made
of
there
is
moreover
no
stuff
more
resistant
nor
more
substantial
for
our
duration
is
not
merely
one
instant
replacing
another
if
it
were
there
would
never
be
anything
but
the
present
no
prolonging
of
the
past
into
the
actual
no
evolution
no
concrete
duration
duration
is
the
continuous
progress
of
the
past
which
gnaws
into
the
future
and
which
swells
as
it
advances
and
as
the
past
grows
without
ceasing
so
also
there
is
no
limit
to
its
preservation
memory
as
we
have
tried
to
prove
is
not
a
faculty
of
putting
away
recollections
in
a
drawer
or
of
inscribing
them
in
a
register
there
is
no
register
no
drawer
there
is
not
even
properly
speaking
a
faculty
for
a
faculty
works
intermittently
when
it
will
or
when
it
can
whilst
the
piling
up
of
the
past
upon
the
past
goes
on
without
relaxation
in
reality
the
past
is
preserved
by
itself
automatically
in
its
entirety
probably
it
follows
us
at
every
instant
all
that
we
have
felt
thought
and
willed
from
our
earliest
infancy
is
there
leaning
over
the
present
which
is
about
to
join
it
pressing
against
the
portals
of
consciousness
that
would
fain
leave
it
outside
the
cerebral
mechanism
is
arranged
just
so
as
to
drive
back
into
the
unconscious
almost
the
whole
of
this
past
and
to
admit
beyond
the
threshold
only
that
which
can
cast
light
on
the
present
situation
or
further
the
action
now
being
prepared
in
short
only
that
which
can
give
work
at
the
most
a
few
superfluous
recollections
may
succeed
in
smuggling
themselves
through
the
door
these
memories
messengers
from
the
unconscious
remind
us
of
what
we
are
dragging
behind
us
unawares
but
even
though
we
may
have
no
distinct
idea
of
it
we
feel
vaguely
that
our
past
remains
present
to
us
what
are
we
in
fact
what
is
our
if
not
the
condensation
of
the
history
that
we
have
lived
from
our
birth
nay
even
before
our
birth
since
we
bring
with
us
prenatal
dispositions
doubtless
we
think
with
only
a
small
part
of
our
past
but
it
is
with
our
entire
past
including
the
original
bent
of
our
soul
that
we
desire
will
and
act
our
past
then
as
a
whole
is
made
manifest
to
us
in
its
impulse
it
is
felt
in
the
form
of
tendency
although
a
small
part
of
it
only
is
known
in
the
form
of
idea
from
this
survival
of
the
past
it
follows
that
consciousness
can
not
go
through
the
same
state
twice
the
circumstances
may
still
be
the
same
but
they
will
act
no
longer
on
the
same
person
since
they
find
him
at
a
new
moment
of
his
history
our
personality
which
is
being
built
up
each
instant
with
its
accumulated
experience
changes
without
ceasing
by
changing
it
prevents
any
state
although
superficially
identical
with
another
from
ever
repeating
it
in
its
very
depth
that
is
why
our
duration
is
irreversible
we
could
not
live
over
again
a
single
moment
for
we
should
have
to
begin
by
effacing
the
memory
of
all
that
had
followed
even
could
we
erase
this
memory
from
our
intellect
we
could
not
from
our
will
thus
our
personality
shoots
grows
and
ripens
without
ceasing
each
of
its
moments
is
something
new
added
to
what
was
before
we
may
go
further
it
is
not
only
something
new
but
something
unforeseeable
doubtless
my
present
state
is
explained
by
what
was
in
me
and
by
what
was
acting
on
me
a
moment
ago
in
analyzing
it
i
should
find
no
other
elements
but
even
a
superhuman
intelligence
would
not
have
been
able
to
foresee
the
simple
indivisible
form
which
gives
to
these
purely
abstract
elements
their
concrete
organization
for
to
foresee
consists
of
projecting
into
the
future
what
has
been
perceived
in
the
past
or
of
imagining
for
a
later
time
a
new
grouping
in
a
new
order
of
elements
already
perceived
but
that
which
has
never
been
perceived
and
which
is
at
the
same
time
simple
is
necessarily
unforeseeable
now
such
is
the
case
with
each
of
our
states
regarded
as
a
moment
in
a
history
that
is
gradually
unfolding
it
is
simple
and
it
can
not
have
been
already
perceived
since
it
concentrates
in
its
indivisibility
all
that
has
been
perceived
and
what
the
present
is
adding
to
it
besides
it
is
an
original
moment
of
a
no
less
original
history
the
finished
portrait
is
explained
by
the
features
of
the
model
by
the
nature
of
the
artist
by
the
colors
spread
out
on
the
palette
but
even
with
the
knowledge
of
what
explains
it
no
one
not
even
the
artist
could
have
foreseen
exactly
what
the
portrait
would
be
for
to
predict
it
would
have
been
to
produce
it
before
it
was
produced
an
absurd
hypothesis
which
is
its
own
refutation
even
so
with
regard
to
the
moments
of
our
life
of
which
we
are
the
artisans
each
of
them
is
a
kind
of
creation
and
just
as
the
talent
of
the
painter
is
formed
or
deformed
in
any
case
is
modified
under
the
very
influence
of
the
works
he
produces
so
each
of
our
states
at
the
moment
of
its
issue
modifies
our
personality
being
indeed
the
new
form
that
we
are
just
assuming
it
is
then
right
to
say
that
what
we
do
depends
on
what
we
are
but
it
is
necessary
to
add
also
that
we
are
to
a
certain
extent
what
we
do
and
that
we
are
creating
ourselves
continually
this
creation
of
self
by
self
is
the
more
complete
the
more
one
reasons
on
what
one
does
for
reason
does
not
proceed
in
such
matters
as
in
geometry
where
impersonal
premisses
are
given
once
for
all
and
an
impersonal
conclusion
must
perforce
be
drawn
here
on
the
contrary
the
same
reasons
may
dictate
to
different
persons
or
to
the
same
person
at
different
moments
acts
profoundly
different
although
equally
reasonable
the
truth
is
that
they
are
not
quite
the
same
reasons
since
they
are
not
those
of
the
same
person
nor
of
the
same
moment
that
is
why
we
can
not
deal
with
them
in
the
abstract
from
outside
as
in
geometry
nor
solve
for
another
the
problems
by
which
he
is
faced
in
life
each
must
solve
them
from
within
on
his
own
account
but
we
need
not
go
more
deeply
into
this
we
are
seeking
only
the
precise
meaning
that
our
consciousness
gives
to
this
word
exist
and
we
find
that
for
a
conscious
being
to
exist
is
to
change
to
change
is
to
mature
to
mature
is
to
go
on
creating
oneself
endlessly
should
the
same
be
said
of
existence
in
general
a
material
object
of
whatever
kind
presents
opposite
characters
to
those
which
we
have
just
been
describing
either
it
remains
as
it
is
or
else
if
it
changes
under
the
influence
of
an
external
force
our
idea
of
this
change
is
that
of
a
displacement
of
parts
which
themselves
do
not
change
if
these
parts
took
to
changing
we
should
split
them
up
in
their
turn
we
should
thus
descend
to
the
molecules
of
which
the
fragments
are
made
to
the
atoms
that
make
up
the
molecules
to
the
corpuscles
that
generate
the
atoms
to
the
imponderable
within
which
the
corpuscle
is
perhaps
a
mere
vortex
in
short
we
should
push
the
division
or
analysis
as
far
as
necessary
but
we
should
stop
only
before
the
unchangeable
now
we
say
that
a
composite
object
changes
by
the
displacement
of
its
parts
but
when
a
part
has
left
its
position
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
its
return
to
it
a
group
of
elements
which
has
gone
through
a
state
can
therefore
always
find
its
way
back
to
that
state
if
not
by
itself
at
least
by
means
of
an
external
cause
able
to
restore
everything
to
its
place
this
amounts
to
saying
that
any
state
of
the
group
may
be
repeated
as
often
as
desired
and
consequently
that
the
group
does
not
grow
old
it
has
no
history
thus
nothing
is
created
therein
neither
form
nor
matter
what
the
group
will
be
is
already
present
in
what
it
is
provided
what
it
is
includes
all
the
points
of
the
universe
with
which
it
is
related
a
superhuman
intellect
could
calculate
for
any
moment
of
time
the
position
of
any
point
of
the
system
in
space
and
as
there
is
nothing
more
in
the
form
of
the
whole
than
the
arrangement
of
its
parts
the
future
forms
of
the
system
are
theoretically
visible
in
its
present
configuration
all
our
belief
in
objects
all
our
operations
on
the
systems
that
science
isolates
rest
in
fact
on
the
idea
that
time
does
not
bite
into
them
we
have
touched
on
this
question
in
an
earlier
work
and
shall
return
to
it
in
the
course
of
the
present
study
for
the
moment
we
will
confine
ourselves
to
pointing
out
that
the
abstract
time
attributed
by
science
to
a
material
object
or
to
an
isolated
system
consists
only
in
a
certain
number
of
simultaneities
or
more
generally
of
correspondences
and
that
this
number
remains
the
same
whatever
be
the
nature
of
the
intervals
between
the
correspondences
with
these
intervals
we
are
never
concerned
when
dealing
with
inert
matter
or
if
they
are
considered
it
is
in
order
to
count
therein
fresh
correspondences
between
which
again
we
shall
not
care
what
happens
common
sense
which
is
occupied
with
detached
objects
and
also
science
which
considers
isolated
systems
are
concerned
only
with
the
ends
of
the
intervals
and
not
with
the
intervals
themselves
therefore
the
flow
of
time
might
assume
an
infinite
rapidity
the
entire
past
present
and
future
of
material
objects
or
of
isolated
systems
might
be
spread
out
all
at
once
in
space
without
there
being
anything
to
change
either
in
the
formulae
of
the
scientist
or
even
in
the
language
of
common
sense
the
number
would
always
stand
for
the
same
thing
it
would
still
count
the
same
number
of
correspondences
between
the
states
of
the
objects
or
systems
and
the
points
of
the
line
ready
drawn
which
would
be
then
the
course
of
time
yet
succession
is
an
undeniable
fact
even
in
the
material
world
though
our
reasoning
on
isolated
systems
may
imply
that
their
history
past
present
and
future
might
be
instantaneously
unfurled
like
a
fan
this
history
in
point
of
fact
unfolds
itself
gradually
as
if
it
occupied
a
duration
like
our
own
if
i
want
to
mix
a
glass
of
sugar
and
water
i
must
willy
nilly
wait
until
the
sugar
melts
this
little
fact
is
big
with
meaning
for
here
the
time
i
have
to
wait
is
not
that
mathematical
time
which
would
apply
equally
well
to
the
entire
history
of
the
material
world
even
if
that
history
were
spread
out
instantaneously
in
space
it
coincides
with
my
impatience
that
is
to
say
with
a
certain
portion
of
my
own
duration
which
i
can
not
protract
or
contract
as
i
like
it
is
no
longer
something
it
is
something
it
is
no
longer
a
relation
it
is
an
absolute
what
else
can
this
mean
than
that
the
glass
of
water
the
sugar
and
the
process
of
the
melting
in
the
water
are
abstractions
and
that
the
whole
within
which
they
have
been
cut
out
by
my
senses
and
understanding
progresses
it
may
be
in
the
manner
of
a
consciousness
certainly
the
operation
by
which
science
isolates
and
closes
a
system
is
not
altogether
artificial
if
it
had
no
objective
foundation
we
could
not
explain
why
it
is
clearly
indicated
in
some
cases
and
impossible
in
others
we
shall
see
that
matter
has
a
tendency
to
constitute
systems
that
can
be
treated
geometrically
in
fact
we
shall
define
matter
by
just
this
tendency
but
it
is
only
a
tendency
matter
does
not
go
to
the
end
and
the
isolation
is
never
complete
if
science
does
go
to
the
end
and
isolate
completely
it
is
for
convenience
of
study
it
is
understood
that
the
isolated
system
remains
subject
to
certain
external
influences
science
merely
leaves
these
alone
either
because
it
finds
them
slight
enough
to
be
negligible
or
because
it
intends
to
take
them
into
account
later
on
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
these
influences
are
so
many
threads
which
bind
up
the
system
to
another
more
extensive
and
to
this
a
third
which
includes
both
and
so
on
to
the
system
most
objectively
isolated
and
most
independent
of
all
the
solar
system
complete
but
even
here
the
isolation
is
not
absolute
our
sun
radiates
heat
and
light
beyond
the
farthest
planet
and
on
the
other
hand
it
moves
in
a
certain
fixed
direction
drawing
with
it
the
planets
and
their
satellites
the
thread
attaching
it
to
the
rest
of
the
universe
is
doubtless
very
tenuous
nevertheless
it
is
along
this
thread
that
is
transmitted
down
to
the
smallest
particle
of
the
world
in
which
we
live
the
duration
immanent
to
the
whole
of
the
universe
the
universe
the
more
we
study
the
nature
of
time
the
more
we
shall
comprehend
that
duration
means
invention
the
creation
of
forms
the
continual
elaboration
of
the
absolutely
new
the
systems
marked
off
by
science
only
because
they
are
bound
up
inseparably
with
the
rest
of
the
universe
it
is
true
that
in
the
universe
itself
two
opposite
movements
are
to
be
distinguished
as
we
shall
see
later
on
descent
and
ascent
the
first
only
unwinds
a
roll
ready
prepared
in
principle
it
might
be
accomplished
almost
instantaneously
like
releasing
a
spring
but
the
ascending
movement
which
corresponds
to
an
inner
work
of
ripening
or
creating
essentially
and
imposes
its
rhythm
on
the
first
which
is
inseparable
from
it
there
is
no
reason
therefore
why
a
duration
and
so
a
form
of
existence
like
our
own
should
not
be
attributed
to
the
systems
that
science
isolates
provided
such
systems
are
reintegrated
into
the
whole
but
they
must
be
so
reintegrated
the
same
is
even
more
obviously
true
of
the
objects
cut
out
by
our
perception
the
distinct
outlines
which
we
see
in
an
object
and
which
give
it
its
individuality
are
only
the
design
of
a
certain
kind
of
that
we
might
exert
on
a
certain
point
of
space
it
is
the
plan
of
our
eventual
actions
that
is
sent
back
to
our
eyes
as
though
by
a
mirror
when
we
see
the
surfaces
and
edges
of
things
suppress
this
action
and
with
it
consequently
those
main
directions
which
by
perception
are
traced
out
for
it
in
the
entanglement
of
the
real
and
the
individuality
of
the
body
is
reabsorbed
in
the
universal
interaction
which
without
doubt
is
reality
itself
now
we
have
considered
material
objects
generally
are
there
not
some
objects
privileged
the
bodies
we
perceive
are
so
to
speak
cut
out
of
the
stuff
of
nature
by
our
and
the
scissors
follow
in
some
way
the
marking
of
lines
along
which
might
be
taken
but
the
body
which
is
to
perform
this
action
the
body
which
marks
out
upon
matter
the
design
of
its
eventual
actions
even
before
they
are
actual
the
body
that
has
only
to
point
its
sensory
organs
on
the
flow
of
the
real
in
order
to
make
that
flow
crystallize
into
definite
forms
and
thus
to
create
all
the
other
bodies
in
short
the
body
is
this
a
body
as
others
are
doubtless
it
also
consists
in
a
portion
of
extension
bound
up
with
the
rest
of
extension
an
intimate
part
of
the
whole
subject
to
the
same
physical
and
chemical
laws
that
govern
any
and
every
portion
of
matter
but
while
the
subdivision
of
matter
into
separate
bodies
is
relative
to
our
perception
while
the
building
up
of
systems
of
material
points
is
relative
to
our
science
the
living
body
has
been
separated
and
closed
off
by
nature
herself
it
is
composed
of
unlike
parts
that
complete
each
other
it
performs
diverse
functions
that
involve
each
other
it
is
an
and
of
no
other
object
not
even
of
the
crystal
can
this
be
said
for
a
crystal
has
neither
difference
of
parts
nor
diversity
of
functions
no
doubt
it
is
hard
to
decide
even
in
the
organized
world
what
is
individual
and
what
is
not
the
difficulty
is
great
even
in
the
animal
kingdom
with
plants
it
is
almost
insurmountable
this
difficulty
is
moreover
due
to
profound
causes
on
which
we
shall
dwell
later
we
shall
see
that
individuality
admits
of
any
number
of
degrees
and
that
it
is
not
fully
realized
anywhere
even
in
man
but
that
is
no
reason
for
thinking
it
is
not
a
characteristic
property
of
life
the
biologist
who
proceeds
as
a
geometrician
is
too
ready
to
take
advantage
here
of
our
inability
to
give
a
precise
and
general
definition
of
individuality
a
perfect
definition
applies
only
to
a
reality
now
vital
properties
are
never
entirely
realized
though
always
on
the
way
to
become
so
they
are
not
so
much
as
and
a
tendency
achieves
all
that
it
aims
at
only
if
it
is
not
thwarted
by
another
tendency
how
then
could
this
occur
in
the
domain
of
life
where
as
we
shall
show
the
interaction
of
antagonistic
tendencies
is
always
implied
in
particular
it
may
be
said
of
individuality
that
while
the
tendency
to
individuate
is
everywhere
present
in
the
organized
world
it
is
everywhere
opposed
by
the
tendency
towards
reproduction
for
the
individuality
to
be
perfect
it
would
be
necessary
that
no
detached
part
of
the
organism
could
live
separately
but
then
reproduction
would
be
impossible
for
what
is
reproduction
but
the
building
up
of
a
new
organism
with
a
detached
fragment
of
the
old
individuality
therefore
harbors
its
enemy
at
home
its
very
need
of
perpetuating
itself
in
time
condemns
it
never
to
be
complete
in
space
the
biologist
must
take
due
account
of
both
tendencies
in
every
instance
and
it
is
therefore
useless
to
ask
him
for
a
definition
of
individuality
that
shall
fit
all
cases
and
work
automatically
but
too
often
one
reasons
about
the
things
of
life
in
the
same
way
as
about
the
conditions
of
crude
matter
nowhere
is
the
confusion
so
evident
as
in
discussions
about
individuality
we
are
shown
the
stumps
of
a
lumbriculus
each
regenerating
its
head
and
living
as
an
independent
individual
a
hydra
whose
pieces
become
so
many
fresh
hydras
a
egg
whose
fragments
develop
complete
embryos
where
then
we
are
asked
was
the
individuality
of
the
egg
the
hydra
the
worm
but
because
there
are
several
individuals
now
it
does
not
follow
that
there
was
not
a
single
individual
just
before
no
doubt
when
i
have
seen
several
drawers
fall
from
a
chest
i
have
no
longer
the
right
to
say
that
the
article
was
all
of
one
piece
but
the
fact
is
that
there
can
be
nothing
more
in
the
present
of
the
chest
of
drawers
than
there
was
in
its
past
and
if
it
is
made
up
of
several
different
pieces
now
it
was
so
from
the
date
of
its
manufacture
generally
speaking
unorganized
bodies
which
are
what
we
have
need
of
in
order
that
we
may
act
and
on
which
we
have
modelled
our
fashion
of
thinking
are
regulated
by
this
simple
law
present
contains
nothing
more
than
the
past
and
what
is
found
in
the
effect
was
already
in
the
but
suppose
that
the
distinctive
feature
of
the
organized
body
is
that
it
grows
and
changes
without
ceasing
as
indeed
the
most
superficial
observation
testifies
there
would
be
nothing
astonishing
in
the
fact
that
it
was
in
the
first
instance
and
afterwards
the
reproduction
of
unicellular
organisms
consists
in
just
this
the
living
being
divides
into
two
halves
of
which
each
is
a
complete
individual
true
in
the
more
complex
animals
nature
localizes
in
the
almost
independent
sexual
cells
the
power
of
producing
the
whole
anew
but
something
of
this
power
may
remain
diffused
in
the
rest
of
the
organism
as
the
facts
of
regeneration
prove
and
it
is
conceivable
that
in
certain
privileged
cases
the
faculty
may
persist
integrally
in
a
latent
condition
and
manifest
itself
on
the
first
opportunity
in
truth
that
i
may
have
the
right
to
speak
of
individuality
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
organism
should
be
without
the
power
to
divide
into
fragments
that
are
able
to
live
it
is
sufficient
that
it
should
have
presented
a
certain
systematization
of
parts
before
the
division
and
that
the
same
systematization
tend
to
be
reproduced
in
each
separate
portion
afterwards
now
that
is
precisely
what
we
observe
in
the
organic
world
we
may
conclude
then
that
individuality
is
never
perfect
and
that
it
is
often
difficult
sometimes
impossible
to
tell
what
is
an
individual
and
what
is
not
but
that
life
nevertheless
manifests
a
search
for
individuality
as
if
it
strove
to
constitute
systems
naturally
isolated
naturally
closed
by
this
is
a
living
being
distinguished
from
all
that
our
perception
or
our
science
isolates
or
closes
artificially
it
would
therefore
be
wrong
to
compare
it
to
an
should
we
wish
to
find
a
term
of
comparison
in
the
inorganic
world
it
is
not
to
a
determinate
material
object
but
much
rather
to
the
totality
of
the
material
universe
that
we
ought
to
compare
the
living
organism
it
is
true
that
the
comparison
would
not
be
worth
much
for
a
living
being
is
observable
whilst
the
whole
of
the
universe
is
constructed
or
reconstructed
by
thought
but
at
least
our
attention
would
thus
have
been
called
to
the
essential
character
of
organization
like
the
universe
as
a
whole
like
each
conscious
being
taken
separately
the
organism
which
lives
is
a
thing
that
its
past
in
its
entirety
is
prolonged
into
its
present
and
abides
there
actual
and
acting
how
otherwise
could
we
understand
that
it
passes
through
distinct
and
phases
that
it
changes
its
age
in
short
that
it
has
a
history
if
i
consider
my
body
in
particular
i
find
that
like
my
consciousness
it
matures
little
by
little
from
infancy
to
old
age
like
myself
it
grows
old
indeed
maturity
and
old
age
are
properly
speaking
attributes
only
of
my
body
it
is
only
metaphorically
that
i
apply
the
same
names
to
the
corresponding
changes
of
my
conscious
self
now
if
i
pass
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
scale
of
living
beings
from
one
of
the
most
to
one
of
the
least
differentiated
from
the
multicellular
organism
of
man
to
the
unicellular
organism
of
the
infusorian
i
find
even
in
this
simple
cell
the
same
process
of
growing
old
the
infusorian
is
exhausted
at
the
end
of
a
certain
number
of
divisions
and
though
it
may
be
possible
by
modifying
the
environment
to
put
off
the
moment
when
a
rejuvenation
by
conjugation
becomes
necessary
this
can
not
be
indefinitely
postponed
it
is
true
that
between
these
two
extreme
cases
in
which
the
organism
is
completely
individualized
there
might
be
found
a
multitude
of
others
in
which
the
individuality
is
less
well
marked
and
in
which
although
there
is
doubtless
an
ageing
somewhere
one
can
not
say
exactly
what
it
is
that
grows
old
once
more
there
is
no
universal
biological
law
which
applies
precisely
and
automatically
to
every
living
thing
there
are
only
in
which
life
throws
out
species
in
general
each
particular
species
in
the
very
act
by
which
it
is
constituted
affirms
its
independence
follows
its
caprice
deviates
more
or
less
from
the
straight
line
sometimes
even
remounts
the
slope
and
seems
to
turn
its
back
on
its
original
direction
it
is
easy
enough
to
argue
that
a
tree
never
grows
old
since
the
tips
of
its
branches
are
always
equally
young
always
equally
capable
of
engendering
new
trees
by
budding
but
in
such
an
organism
which
is
after
all
a
society
rather
than
an
individual
ages
if
only
the
leaves
and
the
interior
of
the
trunk
and
each
cell
considered
separately
evolves
in
a
specific
way
anything
lives
there
is
open
somewhere
a
register
in
which
time
is
being
this
it
will
be
said
is
only
a
it
is
of
the
very
essence
of
mechanism
in
fact
to
consider
as
metaphorical
every
expression
which
attributes
to
time
an
effective
action
and
a
reality
of
its
own
in
vain
does
immediate
experience
show
us
that
the
very
basis
of
our
conscious
existence
is
memory
that
is
to
say
the
prolongation
of
the
past
into
the
present
or
in
a
word
acting
and
irreversible
in
vain
does
reason
prove
to
us
that
the
more
we
get
away
from
the
objects
cut
out
and
the
systems
isolated
by
common
sense
and
by
science
and
the
deeper
we
dig
beneath
them
the
more
we
have
to
do
with
a
reality
which
changes
as
a
whole
in
its
inmost
states
as
if
an
accumulative
memory
of
the
past
made
it
impossible
to
go
back
again
the
mechanistic
instinct
of
the
mind
is
stronger
than
reason
stronger
than
immediate
experience
the
metaphysician
that
we
each
carry
unconsciously
within
us
and
the
presence
of
which
is
explained
as
we
shall
see
later
on
by
the
very
place
that
man
occupies
amongst
the
living
beings
has
its
fixed
requirements
its
explanations
its
irreducible
propositions
all
unite
in
denying

change
be
reducible
to
an
arrangement
or
rearrangement
of
parts
the
irreversibility
of
time
be
an
appearance
relative
to
our
ignorance
the
impossibility
of
turning
back
be
only
the
inability
of
man
to
put
things
in
place
again
so
growing
old
can
be
nothing
more
than
the
gradual
gain
or
loss
of
certain
substances
perhaps
both
together
time
is
assumed
to
have
just
as
much
reality
for
a
living
being
as
for
an
in
which
the
top
part
empties
while
the
lower
fills
and
all
goes
where
it
was
before
when
you
turn
the
glass
upside
down
true
biologists
are
not
agreed
on
what
is
gained
and
what
is
lost
between
the
day
of
birth
and
the
day
of
death
there
are
those
who
hold
to
the
continual
growth
in
the
volume
of
protoplasm
from
the
birth
of
the
cell
right
on
to
its
death
more
probable
and
more
profound
is
the
theory
according
to
which
the
diminution
bears
on
the
quantity
of
nutritive
substance
contained
in
that
inner
environment
in
which
the
organism
is
being
renewed
and
the
increase
on
the
quantity
of
unexcreted
residual
substances
which
accumulating
in
the
body
finally
crust
it
over
must
we
however
with
an
eminent
bacteriologist
declare
any
explanation
of
growing
old
insufficient
that
does
not
take
account
of
phagocytosis
we
do
not
feel
qualified
to
settle
the
question
but
the
fact
that
the
two
theories
agree
in
affirming
the
constant
accumulation
or
loss
of
a
certain
kind
of
matter
even
though
they
have
little
in
common
as
to
what
is
gained
and
lost
shows
pretty
well
that
the
frame
of
the
explanation
has
been
furnished
we
shall
see
this
more
and
more
as
we
proceed
with
our
study
it
is
not
easy
in
thinking
of
time
to
escape
the
image
of
the
the
cause
of
growing
old
must
lie
deeper
we
hold
that
there
is
unbroken
continuity
between
the
evolution
of
the
embryo
and
that
of
the
complete
organism
the
impetus
which
causes
a
living
being
to
grow
larger
to
develop
and
to
age
is
the
same
that
has
caused
it
to
pass
through
the
phases
of
the
embryonic
life
the
development
of
the
embryo
is
a
perpetual
change
of
form
any
one
who
attempts
to
note
all
its
successive
aspects
becomes
lost
in
an
infinity
as
is
inevitable
in
dealing
with
a
continuum
life
does
but
prolong
this
prenatal
evolution
the
proof
of
this
is
that
it
is
often
impossible
for
us
to
say
whether
we
are
dealing
with
an
organism
growing
old
or
with
an
embryo
continuing
to
evolve
such
is
the
case
for
example
with
the
larvae
of
insects
and
crustacea
on
the
other
hand
in
an
organism
such
as
our
own
crises
like
puberty
or
the
menopause
in
which
the
individual
is
completely
transformed
are
quite
comparable
to
changes
in
the
course
of
larval
or
embryonic
life
yet
they
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
process
of
our
ageing
although
they
occur
at
a
definite
age
and
within
a
time
that
may
be
quite
short
no
one
would
maintain
that
they
appear
then
from
without
simply
because
a
certain
age
is
reached
just
as
a
legal
right
is
granted
to
us
on
our
birthday
it
is
evident
that
a
change
like
that
of
puberty
is
in
course
of
preparation
at
every
instant
from
birth
and
even
before
birth
and
that
the
ageing
up
to
that
crisis
consists
in
part
at
least
of
this
gradual
preparation
in
short
what
is
properly
vital
in
growing
old
is
the
insensible
infinitely
graduated
continuance
of
the
change
of
form
now
this
change
is
undoubtedly
accompanied
by
phenomena
of
organic
destruction
to
these
and
to
these
alone
will
a
mechanistic
explanation
of
ageing
be
confined
it
will
note
the
facts
of
sclerosis
the
gradual
accumulation
of
residual
substances
the
growing
hypertrophy
of
the
protoplasm
of
the
cell
but
under
these
visible
effects
an
inner
cause
lies
hidden
the
evolution
of
the
living
being
like
that
of
the
embryo
implies
a
continual
recording
of
duration
a
persistence
of
the
past
in
the
present
and
so
an
appearance
at
least
of
organic
memory
the
present
state
of
an
unorganized
body
depends
exclusively
on
what
happened
at
the
previous
instant
and
likewise
the
position
of
the
material
points
of
a
system
defined
and
isolated
by
science
is
determined
by
the
position
of
these
same
points
at
the
moment
immediately
before
in
other
words
the
laws
that
govern
unorganized
matter
are
expressible
in
principle
by
differential
equations
in
which
time
in
the
sense
in
which
the
mathematician
takes
this
word
would
play
the
rôle
of
independent
variable
is
it
so
with
the
laws
of
life
does
the
state
of
a
living
body
find
its
complete
explanation
in
the
state
immediately
before
yes
if
it
is
agreed
to
liken
the
living
body
to
other
bodies
and
to
identify
it
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
with
the
artificial
systems
on
which
the
chemist
physicist
and
astronomer
operate
but
in
astronomy
physics
and
chemistry
the
proposition
has
a
perfectly
definite
meaning
it
signifies
that
certain
aspects
of
the
present
important
for
science
are
calculable
as
functions
of
the
immediate
past
nothing
of
the
sort
in
the
domain
of
life
here
calculation
touches
at
most
certain
phenomena
of
organic
organic
on
the
contrary
the
evolutionary
phenomena
which
properly
constitute
life
we
can
not
in
any
way
subject
to
a
mathematical
treatment
it
will
be
said
that
this
impotence
is
due
only
to
our
ignorance
but
it
may
equally
well
express
the
fact
that
the
present
moment
of
a
living
body
does
not
find
its
explanation
in
the
moment
immediately
before
that
the
past
of
the
organism
must
be
added
to
that
moment
its
heredity
in
fact
the
whole
of
a
very
long
history
in
the
second
of
these
two
hypotheses
not
in
the
first
is
really
expressed
the
present
state
of
the
biological
sciences
as
well
as
their
direction
as
for
the
idea
that
the
living
body
might
be
treated
by
some
superhuman
calculator
in
the
same
mathematical
way
as
our
solar
system
this
has
gradually
arisen
from
a
metaphysic
which
has
taken
a
more
precise
form
since
the
physical
discoveries
of
galileo
but
which
as
we
shall
show
was
always
the
natural
metaphysic
of
the
human
mind
its
apparent
clearness
our
impatient
desire
to
find
it
true
the
enthusiasm
with
which
so
many
excellent
minds
accept
it
without
proof
all
the
seductions
in
short
that
it
exercises
on
our
thought
should
put
us
on
our
guard
against
it
the
attraction
it
has
for
us
proves
well
enough
that
it
gives
satisfaction
to
an
innate
inclination
but
as
will
be
seen
further
on
the
intellectual
tendencies
innate
which
life
must
have
created
in
the
course
of
its
evolution
are
not
at
all
meant
to
supply
us
with
an
explanation
of
life
they
have
something
else
to
do
any
attempt
to
distinguish
between
an
artificial
and
a
natural
system
between
the
dead
and
the
living
runs
counter
to
this
tendency
at
once
thus
it
happens
that
we
find
it
equally
difficult
to
imagine
that
the
organized
has
duration
and
that
the
unorganized
has
not
when
we
say
that
the
state
of
an
artificial
system
depends
exclusively
on
its
state
at
the
moment
before
does
it
not
seem
as
if
we
were
bringing
time
in
as
if
the
system
had
something
to
do
with
real
duration
and
on
the
other
hand
though
the
whole
of
the
past
goes
into
the
making
of
the
living
being
present
moment
does
not
organic
memory
press
it
into
the
moment
immediately
before
the
present
so
that
the
moment
immediately
before
becomes
the
sole
cause
of
the
present
one
to
speak
thus
is
to
ignore
the
cardinal
difference
between
time
along
which
a
real
system
develops
and
that
time
which
enters
into
our
speculations
on
artificial
systems
what
does
it
mean
to
say
that
the
state
of
an
artificial
system
depends
on
what
it
was
at
the
moment
immediately
before
there
is
no
instant
immediately
before
another
instant
there
could
not
be
any
more
than
there
could
be
one
mathematical
point
touching
another
the
instant
immediately
before
is
in
reality
that
which
is
connected
with
the
present
instant
by
the
interval
all
that
you
mean
to
say
therefore
is
that
the
present
state
of
the
system
is
defined
by
equations
into
which
differential
coefficients
enter
such
as
that
is
to
say
at
bottom
velocities
and
accelerations
you
are
therefore
really
speaking
only
of
the
present
a
present
it
is
true
considered
along
with
its
the
systems
science
works
with
are
in
fact
in
an
instantaneous
present
that
is
always
being
renewed
such
systems
are
never
in
that
real
concrete
duration
in
which
the
past
remains
bound
up
with
the
present
when
the
mathematician
calculates
the
future
state
of
a
system
at
the
end
of
a
time
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
supposing
that
the
universe
vanishes
from
this
moment
till
that
and
suddenly
reappears
it
is
the
moment
only
that
counts
and
that
will
be
a
mere
instant
what
will
flow
on
in
the
interval
that
is
to
say
real
time
does
not
count
and
can
not
enter
into
the
calculation
if
the
mathematician
says
that
he
puts
himself
inside
this
interval
he
means
that
he
is
placing
himself
at
a
certain
point
at
a
particular
moment
therefore
at
the
extremity
again
of
a
certain
time
with
the
interval
up
to
he
is
not
concerned
if
he
divides
the
interval
into
infinitely
small
parts
by
considering
the
differential
he
thereby
expresses
merely
the
fact
that
he
will
consider
accelerations
and
velocities
that
is
to
say
numbers
which
denote
tendencies
and
enable
him
to
calculate
the
state
of
the
system
at
a
given
moment
but
he
is
always
speaking
of
a
given
moment
a
static
moment
that
is
and
not
of
flowing
time
in
short
world
the
mathematician
deals
with
is
a
world
that
dies
and
is
reborn
at
every
instant
the
world
which
descartes
was
thinking
of
when
he
spoke
of
continued
but
in
time
thus
conceived
how
could
evolution
which
is
the
very
essence
of
life
ever
take
place
evolution
implies
a
real
persistence
of
the
past
in
the
present
a
duration
which
is
as
it
were
a
hyphen
a
connecting
link
in
other
words
to
know
a
living
being
or
is
to
get
at
the
very
interval
of
duration
while
the
knowledge
of
an
or
applies
only
to
the
extremity
continuity
of
change
preservation
of
the
past
in
the
present
real
duration
the
living
being
seems
then
to
share
these
attributes
with
consciousness
can
we
go
further
and
say
that
life
like
conscious
activity
is
invention
is
unceasing
creation
it
does
not
enter
into
our
plan
to
set
down
here
the
proofs
of
transformism
we
wish
only
to
explain
in
a
word
or
two
why
we
shall
accept
it
in
the
present
work
as
a
sufficiently
exact
and
precise
expression
of
the
facts
actually
known
the
idea
of
transformism
is
already
in
germ
in
the
natural
classification
of
organized
beings
the
naturalist
in
fact
brings
together
the
organisms
that
are
like
each
other
then
divides
the
group
into
within
which
the
likeness
is
still
greater
and
so
on
all
through
the
operation
the
characters
of
the
group
appear
as
general
themes
on
which
each
of
the
performs
its
particular
variation
now
such
is
just
the
relation
we
find
in
the
animal
and
in
the
vegetable
world
between
the
generator
and
the
generated
on
the
canvas
which
the
ancestor
passes
on
and
which
his
descendants
possess
in
common
each
puts
his
own
original
embroidery
true
the
differences
between
the
descendant
and
the
ancestor
are
slight
and
it
may
be
asked
whether
the
same
living
matter
presents
enough
plasticity
to
take
in
turn
such
different
forms
as
those
of
a
fish
a
reptile
and
a
bird
but
to
this
question
observation
gives
a
peremptory
answer
it
shows
that
up
to
a
certain
period
in
its
development
the
embryo
of
the
bird
is
hardly
distinguishable
from
that
of
the
reptile
and
that
the
individual
develops
throughout
the
embryonic
life
in
general
a
series
of
transformations
comparable
to
those
through
which
according
to
the
theory
of
evolution
one
species
passes
into
another
a
single
cell
the
result
of
the
combination
of
two
cells
male
and
female
accomplishes
this
work
by
dividing
every
day
before
our
eyes
the
highest
forms
of
life
are
springing
from
a
very
elementary
form
experience
then
shows
that
the
most
complex
has
been
able
to
issue
from
the
most
simple
by
way
of
evolution
now
has
it
arisen
so
as
a
matter
of
fact
paleontology
in
spite
of
the
insufficiency
of
its
evidence
invites
us
to
believe
it
has
for
where
it
makes
out
the
order
of
succession
of
species
with
any
precision
this
order
is
just
what
considerations
drawn
from
embryogeny
and
comparative
anatomy
would
lead
any
one
to
suppose
and
each
new
paleontological
discovery
brings
transformism
a
new
confirmation
thus
the
proof
drawn
from
mere
observation
is
ever
being
strengthened
while
on
the
other
hand
experiment
is
removing
the
objections
one
by
one
the
recent
experiments
of
de
vries
for
instance
by
showing
that
important
variations
can
be
produced
suddenly
and
transmitted
regularly
have
overthrown
some
of
the
greatest
difficulties
raised
by
the
theory
they
have
enabled
us
greatly
to
shorten
the
time
biological
evolution
seems
to
demand
they
also
render
us
less
exacting
toward
paleontology
so
that
all
things
considered
the
transformist
hypothesis
looks
more
and
more
like
a
close
approximation
to
the
truth
it
is
not
rigorously
demonstrable
but
failing
the
certainty
of
theoretical
or
experimental
demonstration
there
is
a
probability
which
is
continually
growing
due
to
evidence
which
while
coming
short
of
direct
proof
seems
to
point
persistently
in
its
direction
such
is
the
kind
of
probability
that
the
theory
of
transformism
offers
let
us
admit
however
that
transformism
may
be
wrong
let
us
suppose
that
species
are
proved
by
inference
or
by
experiment
to
have
arisen
by
a
discontinuous
process
of
which
we
have
no
idea
would
the
doctrine
be
affected
in
so
far
as
it
has
a
special
interest
or
importance
for
us
classification
would
probably
remain
in
its
broad
lines
the
actual
data
of
embryology
would
also
remain
the
correspondence
between
comparative
embryogeny
and
comparative
anatomy
would
remain
too
therefore
biology
could
and
would
continue
to
establish
between
living
forms
the
same
relations
and
the
same
kinship
as
transformism
supposes
it
would
be
it
is
true
an
kinship
and
no
longer
a
affiliation
but
as
the
actual
data
of
paleontology
would
also
remain
we
should
still
have
to
admit
that
it
is
successively
not
simultaneously
that
the
forms
between
which
we
find
an
ideal
kinship
have
appeared
now
the
evolutionist
theory
so
far
as
it
has
any
importance
for
philosophy
requires
no
more
it
consists
above
all
in
establishing
relations
of
ideal
kinship
and
in
maintaining
that
wherever
there
is
this
relation
of
so
to
speak
affiliation
between
forms
there
is
also
a
relation
of
succession
between
the
species
in
which
these
forms
are
materialized
both
arguments
would
hold
in
any
case
and
hence
an
evolution
would
still
have
to
be
supposed
whether
in
a
creative
thought
in
which
the
ideas
of
the
different
species
are
generated
by
each
other
exactly
as
transformism
holds
that
species
themselves
are
generated
on
the
earth
or
in
a
plan
of
vital
organization
immanent
in
nature
which
gradually
works
itself
out
in
which
the
relations
of
logical
and
chronological
affiliation
between
pure
forms
are
just
those
which
transformism
presents
as
relations
of
real
affiliation
between
living
individuals
or
finally
in
some
unknown
cause
of
life
which
develops
its
effects
they
generated
one
another
evolution
would
then
simply
have
been
made
to
pass
from
the
visible
to
the
invisible
almost
all
that
transformism
tells
us
would
be
preserved
open
to
interpretation
in
another
way
will
it
not
therefore
be
better
to
stick
to
the
letter
of
transformism
as
almost
all
scientists
profess
it
apart
from
the
question
to
what
extent
the
theory
of
evolution
describes
the
facts
and
to
what
extent
it
symbolizes
them
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
is
irreconcilable
with
the
doctrines
it
has
claimed
to
replace
even
with
that
of
special
creations
to
which
it
is
usually
opposed
for
this
reason
we
think
the
language
of
transformism
forces
itself
now
upon
all
philosophy
as
the
dogmatic
affirmation
of
transformism
forces
itself
upon
science
but
then
we
must
no
longer
speak
of
in
as
an
abstraction
or
as
a
mere
heading
under
which
all
living
beings
are
inscribed
at
a
certain
moment
in
certain
points
of
space
a
visible
current
has
taken
rise
this
current
of
life
traversing
the
bodies
it
has
organized
one
after
another
passing
from
generation
to
generation
has
become
divided
amongst
species
and
distributed
amongst
individuals
without
losing
anything
of
its
force
rather
intensifying
in
proportion
to
its
advance
it
is
well
known
that
on
the
theory
of
the
continuity
of
the
maintained
by
weismann
the
sexual
elements
of
the
generating
organism
pass
on
their
properties
directly
to
the
sexual
elements
of
the
organism
engendered
in
this
extreme
form
the
theory
has
seemed
debatable
for
it
is
only
in
exceptional
cases
that
there
are
any
signs
of
sexual
glands
at
the
time
of
segmentation
of
the
fertilized
egg
but
though
the
cells
that
engender
the
sexual
elements
do
not
generally
appear
at
the
beginning
of
the
embryonic
life
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
they
are
always
formed
out
of
those
tissues
of
the
embryo
which
have
not
undergone
any
particular
functional
differentiation
and
whose
cells
are
made
of
unmodified
protoplasm
in
other
words
the
genetic
power
of
the
fertilized
ovum
weakens
the
more
it
is
spread
over
the
growing
mass
of
the
tissues
of
the
embryo
but
while
it
is
being
thus
diluted
it
is
concentrating
anew
something
of
itself
on
a
certain
special
point
to
wit
the
cells
from
which
the
ova
or
spermatozoa
will
develop
it
might
therefore
be
said
that
though
the
is
not
continuous
there
is
at
least
continuity
of
genetic
energy
this
energy
being
expended
only
at
certain
instants
for
just
enough
time
to
give
the
requisite
impulsion
to
the
embryonic
life
and
being
recouped
as
soon
as
possible
in
new
sexual
elements
in
which
again
it
bides
its
time
regarded
from
this
point
of
view
is
like
a
current
passing
from
germ
to
germ
through
the
medium
of
a
developed
it
is
as
if
the
organism
itself
were
only
an
excrescence
a
bud
caused
to
sprout
by
the
former
germ
endeavoring
to
continue
itself
in
a
new
germ
the
essential
thing
is
the
indefinitely
pursued
an
invisible
progress
on
which
each
visible
organism
rides
during
the
short
interval
of
time
given
it
to
live
now
the
more
we
fix
our
attention
on
this
continuity
of
life
the
more
we
see
that
organic
evolution
resembles
the
evolution
of
a
consciousness
in
which
the
past
presses
against
the
present
and
causes
the
upspringing
of
a
new
form
of
consciousness
incommensurable
with
its
antecedents
that
the
appearance
of
a
vegetable
or
animal
species
is
due
to
specific
causes
nobody
will
gainsay
but
this
can
only
mean
that
if
after
the
fact
we
could
know
these
causes
in
detail
we
could
explain
by
them
the
form
that
has
been
produced
foreseeing
the
form
is
out
of
the
question
it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
the
form
could
be
foreseen
if
we
could
know
in
all
their
details
the
conditions
under
which
it
will
be
produced
but
these
conditions
are
built
up
into
it
and
are
part
and
parcel
of
its
being
they
are
peculiar
to
that
phase
of
its
history
in
which
life
finds
itself
at
the
moment
of
producing
the
form
how
could
we
know
beforehand
a
situation
that
is
unique
of
its
kind
that
has
never
yet
occurred
and
will
never
occur
again
of
the
future
only
that
is
foreseen
which
is
like
the
past
or
can
be
made
up
again
with
elements
like
those
of
the
past
such
is
the
case
with
astronomical
physical
and
chemical
facts
with
all
facts
which
form
part
of
a
system
in
which
elements
supposed
to
be
unchanging
are
merely
put
together
in
which
the
only
changes
are
changes
of
position
in
which
there
is
no
theoretical
absurdity
in
imagining
that
things
are
restored
to
their
place
in
which
consequently
the
same
total
phenomenon
or
at
least
the
same
elementary
phenomena
can
be
repeated
but
an
original
situation
which
imparts
something
of
its
own
originality
to
its
elements
that
is
to
say
to
the
partial
views
that
are
taken
of
it
how
can
such
a
situation
be
pictured
as
given
before
it
is
actually
produced
all
that
can
be
said
is
that
once
produced
it
will
be
explained
by
the
elements
that
analysis
will
then
carve
out
of
it
now
what
is
true
of
the
production
of
a
new
species
is
also
true
of
the
production
of
a
new
individual
and
more
generally
of
any
moment
of
any
living
form
for
though
the
variation
must
reach
a
certain
importance
and
a
certain
generality
in
order
to
give
rise
to
a
new
species
it
is
being
produced
every
moment
continuously
and
insensibly
in
every
living
being
and
it
is
evident
that
even
the
sudden
mutations
which
we
now
hear
of
are
possible
only
if
a
process
of
incubation
or
rather
of
maturing
is
going
on
throughout
a
series
of
generations
that
do
not
seem
to
change
in
this
sense
it
might
be
said
of
life
as
of
consciousness
that
at
every
moment
it
is
creating
something
but
against
this
idea
of
the
absolute
originality
and
unforeseeability
of
forms
our
whole
intellect
rises
in
revolt
the
essential
function
of
our
intellect
as
the
evolution
of
life
has
fashioned
it
is
to
be
a
light
for
our
conduct
to
make
ready
for
our
action
on
things
to
foresee
for
a
given
situation
the
events
favorable
or
unfavorable
which
may
follow
thereupon
intellect
therefore
instinctively
selects
in
a
given
situation
whatever
is
like
something
already
known
it
seeks
this
out
in
order
that
it
may
apply
its
principle
that
like
produces
like
in
just
this
does
the
prevision
of
the
future
by
common
sense
consist
science
carries
this
faculty
to
the
highest
possible
degree
of
exactitude
and
precision
but
does
not
alter
its
essential
character
like
ordinary
knowledge
in
dealing
with
things
science
is
concerned
only
with
the
aspect
of
though
the
whole
be
original
science
will
always
manage
to
analyze
it
into
elements
or
aspects
which
are
approximately
a
reproduction
of
the
past
science
can
work
only
on
what
is
supposed
to
repeat
itself
that
is
to
say
on
what
is
withdrawn
by
hypothesis
from
the
action
of
real
time
anything
that
is
irreducible
and
irreversible
in
the
successive
moments
of
a
history
eludes
science
to
get
a
notion
of
this
irreducibility
and
irreversibility
we
must
break
with
scientific
habits
which
are
adapted
to
the
fundamental
requirements
of
thought
we
must
do
violence
to
the
mind
go
counter
to
the
natural
bent
of
the
intellect
but
that
is
just
the
function
of
philosophy
in
vain
therefore
does
life
evolve
before
our
eyes
as
a
continuous
creation
of
unforeseeable
form
the
idea
always
persists
that
form
unforeseeability
and
continuity
are
mere
appearance
the
outward
reflection
of
our
own
ignorance
what
is
presented
to
the
senses
as
a
continuous
history
would
break
up
we
are
told
into
a
series
of
successive
states
what
gives
you
the
impression
of
an
original
state
resolves
upon
analysis
into
elementary
facts
each
of
which
is
the
repetition
of
a
fact
already
known
what
you
call
an
unforeseeable
form
is
only
a
new
arrangement
of
old
elements
the
elementary
causes
which
in
their
totality
have
determined
this
arrangement
are
themselves
old
causes
repeated
in
a
new
order
knowledge
of
the
elements
and
of
the
elementary
causes
would
have
made
it
possible
to
foretell
the
living
form
which
is
their
sum
and
their
resultant
when
we
have
resolved
the
biological
aspect
of
phenomena
into
factors
we
will
leap
if
necessary
over
physics
and
chemistry
themselves
we
will
go
from
masses
to
molecules
from
molecules
to
atoms
from
atoms
to
corpuscles
we
must
indeed
at
last
come
to
something
that
can
be
treated
as
a
kind
of
solar
system
astronomically
if
you
deny
it
you
oppose
the
very
principle
of
scientific
mechanism
and
you
arbitrarily
affirm
that
living
matter
is
not
made
of
the
same
elements
as
other
matter
we
reply
that
we
do
not
question
the
fundamental
identity
of
inert
matter
and
organized
matter
the
only
question
is
whether
the
natural
systems
which
we
call
living
beings
must
be
assimilated
to
the
artificial
systems
that
science
cuts
out
within
inert
matter
or
whether
they
must
not
rather
be
compared
to
that
natural
system
which
is
the
whole
of
the
universe
that
life
is
a
kind
of
mechanism
i
cordially
agree
but
is
it
the
mechanism
of
parts
artificially
isolated
within
the
whole
of
the
universe
or
is
it
the
mechanism
of
the
real
whole
the
real
whole
might
well
be
we
conceive
an
indivisible
continuity
the
systems
we
cut
out
within
it
would
properly
speaking
not
then
be
at
all
they
would
be
of
the
whole
and
with
these
partial
views
put
end
to
end
you
will
not
make
even
a
beginning
of
the
reconstruction
of
the
whole
any
more
than
by
multiplying
photographs
of
an
object
in
a
thousand
different
aspects
you
will
reproduce
the
object
itself
so
of
life
and
of
the
phenomena
to
which
you
endeavor
to
reduce
it
analysis
will
undoubtedly
resolve
the
process
of
organic
creation
into
an
number
of
phenomena
and
chemists
and
physicists
will
have
to
do
of
course
with
nothing
but
these
but
it
does
not
follow
that
chemistry
and
physics
will
ever
give
us
the
key
to
life
a
very
small
element
of
a
curve
is
very
near
being
a
straight
line
and
the
smaller
it
is
the
nearer
in
the
limit
it
may
be
termed
a
part
of
the
curve
or
a
part
of
the
straight
line
as
you
please
for
in
each
of
its
points
a
curve
coincides
with
its
tangent
so
likewise
vitality
is
tangent
at
any
and
every
point
to
physical
and
chemical
forces
but
such
points
are
as
a
fact
only
views
taken
by
a
mind
which
imagines
stops
at
various
moments
of
the
movement
that
generates
the
curve
in
reality
life
is
no
more
made
of
elements
than
a
curve
is
composed
of
straight
lines
in
a
general
way
the
most
radical
progress
a
science
can
achieve
is
the
working
of
the
completed
results
into
a
new
scheme
of
the
whole
by
relation
to
which
they
become
instantaneous
and
motionless
views
taken
at
intervals
along
the
continuity
of
a
movement
such
for
example
is
the
relation
of
modern
to
ancient
geometry
the
latter
purely
static
worked
with
figures
drawn
once
for
all
the
former
studies
the
varying
of
a
function
that
is
the
continuous
movement
by
which
the
figure
is
described
no
doubt
for
greater
strictness
all
considerations
of
motion
may
be
eliminated
from
mathematical
processes
but
the
introduction
of
motion
into
the
genesis
of
figures
is
nevertheless
the
origin
of
modern
mathematics
we
believe
that
if
biology
could
ever
get
as
close
to
its
object
as
mathematics
does
to
its
own
it
would
become
to
the
physics
and
chemistry
of
organized
bodies
what
the
mathematics
of
the
moderns
has
proved
to
be
in
relation
to
ancient
geometry
the
wholly
superficial
displacements
of
masses
and
molecules
studied
in
physics
and
chemistry
would
become
by
relation
to
that
inner
vital
movement
which
is
transformation
and
not
translation
what
the
position
of
a
moving
object
is
to
the
movement
of
that
object
in
space
and
so
far
as
we
can
see
the
procedure
by
which
we
should
then
pass
from
the
definition
of
a
certain
vital
action
to
the
system
of
facts
which
it
implies
would
be
like
passing
from
the
function
to
its
derivative
from
the
equation
of
the
curve
the
law
of
the
continuous
movement
by
which
the
curve
is
generated
to
the
equation
of
the
tangent
giving
its
instantaneous
direction
such
a
science
would
be
a
of
of
which
our
of
would
become
a
particular
case
a
simplification
a
projection
on
the
plane
of
pure
quantity
and
just
as
an
infinity
of
functions
have
the
same
differential
these
functions
differing
from
each
other
by
a
constant
so
perhaps
the
integration
of
the
elements
of
properly
vital
action
might
determine
that
action
only
in
part
a
part
would
be
left
to
indetermination
but
such
an
integration
can
be
no
more
than
dreamed
of
we
do
not
pretend
that
the
dream
will
ever
be
realized
we
are
only
trying
by
carrying
a
certain
comparison
as
far
as
possible
to
show
up
to
what
point
our
theory
goes
along
with
pure
mechanism
and
where
they
part
company
imitation
of
the
living
by
the
unorganized
may
however
go
a
good
way
not
only
does
chemistry
make
organic
syntheses
but
we
have
succeeded
in
reproducing
artificially
the
external
appearance
of
certain
facts
of
organization
such
as
indirect
and
protoplasmic
circulation
it
is
well
known
that
the
protoplasm
of
the
cell
effects
various
movements
within
its
envelope
on
the
other
hand
indirect
is
the
outcome
of
very
complex
operations
some
involving
the
nucleus
and
others
the
cytoplasm
these
latter
commence
by
the
doubling
of
the
centrosome
a
small
spherical
body
alongside
the
nucleus
the
two
centrosomes
thus
obtained
draw
apart
attract
the
broken
and
doubled
ends
of
the
filament
of
which
the
original
nucleus
mainly
consisted
and
join
them
to
form
two
fresh
nuclei
about
which
the
two
new
cells
are
constructed
which
will
succeed
the
first
now
in
their
broad
lines
and
in
their
external
appearance
some
at
least
of
these
operations
have
been
successfully
imitated
if
some
sugar
or
table
salt
is
pulverized
and
some
very
old
oil
is
added
and
a
drop
of
the
mixture
is
observed
under
the
microscope
a
froth
of
alveolar
structure
is
seen
whose
configuration
is
like
that
of
protoplasm
according
to
certain
theories
and
in
which
movements
take
place
which
are
decidedly
like
those
of
protoplasmic
circulation
if
in
a
froth
of
the
same
kind
the
air
is
extracted
from
an
alveolus
a
cone
of
attraction
is
seen
to
form
like
those
about
the
centrosomes
which
result
in
the
division
of
the
nucleus
even
the
external
motions
of
a
unicellular
organism
of
an
amoeba
at
any
rate
are
sometimes
explained
mechanically
the
displacements
of
an
amoeba
in
a
drop
of
water
would
be
comparable
to
the
motion
to
and
fro
of
a
grain
of
dust
in
a
draughty
room
its
mass
is
all
the
time
absorbing
certain
soluble
matters
contained
in
the
surrounding
water
and
giving
back
to
it
certain
others
these
continual
exchanges
like
those
between
two
vessels
separated
by
a
porous
partition
would
create
an
everchanging
vortex
around
the
little
organism
as
for
the
temporary
prolongations
or
pseudopodia
which
the
amoeba
seems
to
make
they
would
be
not
so
much
given
out
by
it
as
attracted
from
it
by
a
kind
of
inhalation
or
suction
of
the
surrounding
medium
in
the
same
way
we
may
perhaps
come
to
explain
the
more
complex
movements
which
the
infusorian
makes
with
its
vibratory
cilia
which
moreover
are
probably
only
fixed
pseudopodia
but
scientists
are
far
from
agreed
on
the
value
of
explanations
and
schemas
of
this
sort
chemists
have
pointed
out
that
even
in
the
organic
not
to
go
so
far
as
the
organized
science
has
reconstructed
hitherto
nothing
but
waste
products
of
vital
activity
the
peculiarly
active
plastic
substances
obstinately
defy
synthesis
one
of
the
most
notable
naturalists
of
our
time
has
insisted
on
the
opposition
of
two
orders
of
phenomena
observed
in
living
tissues
and
the
rôle
of
the
anagenetic
energies
is
to
raise
the
inferior
energies
to
their
own
level
by
assimilating
inorganic
substances
they
the
tissues
on
the
other
hand
the
actual
functioning
of
life
excepting
of
course
assimilation
growth
and
reproduction
is
of
the
katagenetic
order
exhibiting
the
fall
not
the
rise
of
energy
it
is
only
with
these
facts
of
katagenetic
order
that
deals
that
is
in
short
with
the
dead
and
not
with
the
living
the
other
kind
of
facts
certainly
seem
to
defy
analysis
even
if
they
are
not
anagenetic
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
as
for
the
artificial
imitation
of
the
outward
appearance
of
protoplasm
should
a
real
theoretic
importance
be
attached
to
this
when
the
question
of
the
physical
framework
of
protoplasm
is
not
yet
settled
we
are
still
further
from
compounding
protoplasm
chemically
finally
a
explanation
of
the
motions
of
the
amoeba
and
of
the
behavior
of
the
infusoria
seems
impossible
to
many
of
those
who
have
closely
observed
these
rudimentary
organisms
even
in
these
humblest
manifestations
of
life
they
discover
traces
of
an
effective
psychological
activity
but
instructive
above
all
is
the
fact
that
the
tendency
to
explain
everything
by
physics
and
chemistry
is
discouraged
rather
than
strengthened
by
deep
study
of
histological
phenomena
such
is
the
conclusion
of
the
truly
admirable
book
which
the
histologist
wilson
has
devoted
to
the
development
of
the
cell
the
study
of
the
cell
has
on
the
whole
seemed
to
widen
rather
than
to
narrow
the
enormous
gap
that
separates
even
the
lowest
forms
of
life
from
the
inorganic
world
to
sum
up
those
who
are
concerned
only
with
the
functional
activity
of
the
living
being
are
inclined
to
believe
that
physics
and
chemistry
will
give
us
the
key
to
biological
processes
they
have
chiefly
to
do
as
a
fact
with
phenomena
that
are
continually
in
the
living
being
as
in
a
chemical
retort
this
explains
in
some
measure
the
mechanistic
tendencies
of
physiology
on
the
contrary
those
whose
attention
is
concentrated
on
the
minute
structure
of
living
tissues
on
their
genesis
and
evolution
histologists
and
embryogenists
on
the
one
hand
naturalists
on
the
other
are
interested
in
the
retort
itself
not
merely
in
its
contents
they
find
that
this
retort
creates
its
own
form
through
a
series
of
acts
that
really
constitute
a
thus
histologists
embryogenists
and
naturalists
believe
far
less
readily
than
physiologists
in
the
character
of
vital
actions
the
fact
is
neither
one
nor
the
other
of
these
two
theories
neither
that
which
affirms
nor
that
which
denies
the
possibility
of
chemically
producing
an
elementary
organism
can
claim
the
authority
of
experiment
they
are
both
unverifiable
the
former
because
science
has
not
yet
advanced
a
step
toward
the
chemical
synthesis
of
a
living
substance
the
second
because
there
is
no
conceivable
way
of
proving
experimentally
the
impossibility
of
a
fact
but
we
have
set
forth
the
theoretical
reasons
which
prevent
us
from
likening
the
living
being
a
system
closed
off
by
nature
to
the
systems
which
our
science
isolates
these
reasons
have
less
force
we
acknowledge
in
the
case
of
a
rudimentary
organism
like
the
amoeba
which
hardly
evolves
at
all
but
they
acquire
more
when
we
consider
a
complex
organism
which
goes
through
a
regular
cycle
of
transformations
the
more
duration
marks
the
living
being
with
its
imprint
the
more
obviously
the
organism
differs
from
a
mere
mechanism
over
which
duration
glides
without
penetrating
and
the
demonstration
has
most
force
when
it
applies
to
the
evolution
of
life
as
a
whole
from
its
humblest
origins
to
its
highest
forms
inasmuch
as
this
evolution
constitutes
through
the
unity
and
continuity
of
the
animated
matter
which
supports
it
a
single
indivisible
history
thus
viewed
the
evolutionist
hypothesis
does
not
seem
so
closely
akin
to
the
mechanistic
conception
of
life
as
it
is
generally
supposed
to
be
of
this
mechanistic
conception
we
do
not
claim
of
course
to
furnish
a
mathematical
and
final
refutation
but
the
refutation
which
we
draw
from
the
consideration
of
real
time
and
which
is
in
our
opinion
the
only
refutation
possible
becomes
the
more
rigorous
and
cogent
the
more
frankly
the
evolutionist
hypothesis
is
assumed
we
must
dwell
a
good
deal
more
on
this
point
but
let
us
first
show
more
clearly
the
notion
of
life
to
which
we
are
leading
up
the
mechanistic
explanations
we
said
hold
good
for
the
systems
that
our
thought
artificially
detaches
from
the
whole
but
of
the
whole
itself
and
of
the
systems
which
within
this
whole
seem
to
take
after
it
we
can
not
admit
that
they
are
mechanically
explicable
for
then
time
would
be
useless
and
even
unreal
the
essence
of
mechanical
explanation
in
fact
is
to
regard
the
future
and
the
past
as
calculable
functions
of
the
present
and
thus
to
claim
that
is
on
this
hypothesis
past
present
and
future
would
be
open
at
a
glance
to
a
superhuman
intellect
capable
of
making
the
calculation
indeed
the
scientists
who
have
believed
in
the
universality
and
perfect
objectivity
of
mechanical
explanations
have
consciously
or
unconsciously
acted
on
a
hypothesis
of
this
kind
laplace
formulated
it
with
the
greatest
precision
an
intellect
which
at
a
given
instant
knew
all
the
forces
with
which
nature
is
animated
and
the
respective
situations
of
the
beings
that
compose
nature
supposing
the
said
intellect
were
vast
enough
to
subject
these
data
to
analysis
would
embrace
in
the
same
formula
the
motions
of
the
greatest
bodies
in
the
universe
and
those
of
the
slightest
atom
nothing
would
be
uncertain
for
it
and
the
future
like
the
past
would
be
present
to
its
eyes
and
du
we
can
imagine
the
knowledge
of
nature
arrived
at
a
point
where
the
universal
process
of
the
world
might
be
represented
by
a
single
mathematical
formula
by
one
immense
system
of
simultaneous
differential
equations
from
which
could
be
deduced
for
each
moment
the
position
direction
and
velocity
of
every
atom
of
the
world
huxley
has
expressed
the
same
idea
in
a
more
concrete
form
if
the
fundamental
proposition
of
evolution
is
true
that
the
entire
world
living
and
not
living
is
the
result
of
the
mutual
interaction
according
to
definite
laws
of
the
forces
possessed
by
the
molecules
of
which
the
primitive
nebulosity
of
the
universe
was
composed
it
is
no
less
certain
that
the
existing
world
lay
potentially
in
the
cosmic
vapor
and
that
a
sufficient
intellect
could
from
a
knowledge
of
the
properties
of
the
molecules
of
that
vapor
have
predicted
say
the
state
of
the
fauna
of
great
britain
in
with
as
much
certainty
as
one
can
say
what
will
happen
to
the
vapor
of
the
breath
in
a
cold
winter
day
in
such
a
doctrine
time
is
still
spoken
of
one
pronounces
the
word
but
one
does
not
think
of
the
thing
for
time
is
here
deprived
of
efficacy
and
if
it
nothing
it
nothing
radical
mechanism
implies
a
metaphysic
in
which
the
totality
of
the
real
is
postulated
complete
in
eternity
and
in
which
the
apparent
duration
of
things
expresses
merely
the
infirmity
of
a
mind
that
can
not
know
everything
at
once
but
duration
is
something
very
different
from
this
for
our
consciousness
that
is
to
say
for
that
which
is
most
indisputable
in
our
experience
we
perceive
duration
as
a
stream
against
which
we
can
not
go
it
is
the
foundation
of
our
being
and
as
we
feel
the
very
substance
of
the
world
in
which
we
live
it
is
of
no
use
to
hold
up
before
our
eyes
the
dazzling
prospect
of
a
universal
mathematic
we
can
not
sacrifice
experience
to
the
requirements
of
a
system
that
is
why
we
reject
radical
mechanism
but
radical
finalism
is
quite
as
unacceptable
and
for
the
same
reason
the
doctrine
of
teleology
in
its
extreme
form
as
we
find
it
in
leibniz
for
example
implies
that
things
and
beings
merely
realize
a
programme
previously
arranged
but
if
there
is
nothing
unforeseen
no
invention
or
creation
in
the
universe
time
is
useless
again
as
in
the
mechanistic
hypothesis
here
again
it
is
supposed
that
is
finalism
thus
understood
is
only
inverted
mechanism
it
springs
from
the
same
postulate
with
this
sole
difference
that
in
the
movement
of
our
finite
intellects
along
successive
things
whose
successiveness
is
reduced
to
a
mere
appearance
it
holds
in
front
of
us
the
light
with
which
it
claims
to
guide
us
instead
of
putting
it
behind
it
substitutes
the
attraction
of
the
future
for
the
impulsion
of
the
past
but
succession
remains
none
the
less
a
mere
appearance
as
indeed
does
movement
itself
in
the
doctrine
of
leibniz
time
is
reduced
to
a
confused
perception
relative
to
the
human
standpoint
a
perception
which
would
vanish
like
a
rising
mist
for
a
mind
seated
at
the
centre
of
things
yet
finalism
is
not
like
mechanism
a
doctrine
with
fixed
rigid
outlines
it
admits
of
as
many
inflections
as
we
like
the
mechanistic
philosophy
is
to
be
taken
or
left
it
must
be
left
if
the
least
grain
of
dust
by
straying
from
the
path
foreseen
by
mechanics
should
show
the
slightest
trace
of
spontaneity
the
doctrine
of
final
causes
on
the
contrary
will
never
be
definitively
refuted
if
one
form
of
it
be
put
aside
it
will
take
another
its
principle
which
is
essentially
psychological
is
very
flexible
it
is
so
extensible
and
thereby
so
comprehensive
that
one
accepts
something
of
it
as
soon
as
one
rejects
pure
mechanism
the
theory
we
shall
put
forward
in
this
book
will
therefore
necessarily
partake
of
finalism
to
a
certain
extent
for
that
reason
it
is
important
to
intimate
exactly
what
we
are
going
to
take
of
it
and
what
we
mean
to
leave
let
us
say
at
once
that
to
thin
out
the
leibnizian
finalism
by
breaking
it
into
an
infinite
number
of
pieces
seems
to
us
a
step
in
the
wrong
direction
this
is
however
the
tendency
of
the
doctrine
of
finality
it
fully
realizes
that
if
the
universe
as
a
whole
is
the
carrying
out
of
a
plan
this
can
not
be
demonstrated
empirically
and
that
even
of
the
organized
world
alone
it
is
hardly
easier
to
prove
all
harmonious
facts
would
equally
well
testify
to
the
contrary
nature
sets
living
beings
at
discord
with
one
another
she
everywhere
presents
disorder
alongside
of
order
retrogression
alongside
of
progress
but
though
finality
can
not
be
affirmed
either
of
the
whole
of
matter
or
of
the
whole
of
life
might
it
not
yet
be
true
says
the
finalist
of
each
organism
taken
separately
is
there
not
a
wonderful
division
of
labor
a
marvellous
solidarity
among
the
parts
of
an
organism
perfect
order
in
infinite
complexity
does
not
each
living
being
thus
realize
a
plan
immanent
in
its
substance
this
theory
consists
at
bottom
in
breaking
up
the
original
notion
of
finality
into
bits
it
does
not
accept
indeed
it
ridicules
the
idea
of
an
finality
according
to
which
living
beings
are
ordered
with
regard
to
each
other
to
suppose
the
grass
made
for
the
cow
the
lamb
for
the
wolf
that
is
all
acknowledged
to
be
absurd
but
there
is
we
are
told
an
finality
each
being
is
made
for
itself
all
its
parts
conspire
for
the
greatest
good
of
the
whole
and
are
intelligently
organized
in
view
of
that
end
such
is
the
notion
of
finality
which
has
long
been
classic
finalism
has
shrunk
to
the
point
of
never
embracing
more
than
one
living
being
at
a
time
by
making
itself
smaller
it
probably
thought
it
would
offer
less
surface
for
blows
the
truth
is
it
lay
open
to
them
a
great
deal
more
radical
as
our
own
theory
may
appear
finality
is
external
or
it
is
nothing
at
all
consider
the
most
complex
and
the
most
harmonious
organism
all
the
elements
we
are
told
conspire
for
the
greatest
good
of
the
whole
very
well
but
let
us
not
forget
that
each
of
these
elements
may
itself
be
an
organism
in
certain
cases
and
that
in
subordinating
the
existence
of
this
small
organism
to
the
life
of
the
great
one
we
accept
the
principle
of
an
finality
the
idea
of
a
finality
that
is
internal
is
therefore
a
notion
an
organism
is
composed
of
tissues
each
of
which
lives
for
itself
the
cells
of
which
the
tissues
are
made
have
also
a
certain
independence
strictly
speaking
if
the
subordination
of
all
the
elements
of
the
individual
to
the
individual
itself
were
complete
we
might
contend
that
they
are
not
organisms
reserve
the
name
organism
for
the
individual
and
recognize
only
internal
finality
but
every
one
knows
that
these
elements
may
possess
a
true
autonomy
to
say
nothing
of
phagocytes
which
push
independence
to
the
point
of
attacking
the
organism
that
nourishes
them
or
of
germinal
cells
which
have
their
own
life
alongside
the
somatic
cells
the
facts
of
regeneration
are
enough
here
an
element
or
a
group
of
elements
suddenly
reveals
that
however
limited
its
normal
space
and
function
it
can
transcend
them
occasionally
it
may
even
in
certain
cases
be
regarded
as
the
equivalent
of
the
whole
there
lies
the
of
the
vitalistic
theories
we
shall
not
reproach
them
as
is
ordinarily
done
with
replying
to
the
question
by
the
question
itself
the
vital
principle
may
indeed
not
explain
much
but
it
is
at
least
a
sort
of
label
affixed
to
our
ignorance
so
as
to
remind
us
of
this
occasionally
while
mechanism
invites
us
to
ignore
that
ignorance
but
the
position
of
vitalism
is
rendered
very
difficult
by
the
fact
that
in
nature
there
is
neither
purely
internal
finality
nor
absolutely
distinct
individuality
the
organized
elements
composing
the
individual
have
themselves
a
certain
individuality
and
each
will
claim
its
vital
principle
if
the
individual
pretends
to
have
its
own
but
on
the
other
hand
the
individual
itself
is
not
sufficiently
independent
not
sufficiently
cut
off
from
other
things
for
us
to
allow
it
a
vital
principle
of
its
own
an
organism
such
as
a
higher
vertebrate
is
the
most
individuated
of
all
organisms
yet
if
we
take
into
account
that
it
is
only
the
development
of
an
ovum
forming
part
of
the
body
of
its
mother
and
of
a
spermatozoon
belonging
to
the
body
of
its
father
that
the
egg
the
ovum
fertilized
is
a
connecting
link
between
the
two
progenitors
since
it
is
common
to
their
two
substances
we
shall
realize
that
every
individual
organism
even
that
of
a
man
is
merely
a
bud
that
has
sprouted
on
the
combined
body
of
both
its
parents
where
then
does
the
vital
principle
of
the
individual
begin
or
end
gradually
we
shall
be
carried
further
and
further
back
up
to
the
individual
remotest
ancestors
we
shall
find
him
solidary
with
each
of
them
solidary
with
that
little
mass
of
protoplasmic
jelly
which
is
probably
at
the
root
of
the
genealogical
tree
of
life
being
to
a
certain
extent
one
with
this
primitive
ancestor
he
is
also
solidary
with
all
that
descends
from
the
ancestor
in
divergent
directions
in
this
sense
each
individual
may
be
said
to
remain
united
with
the
totality
of
living
beings
by
invisible
bonds
so
it
is
of
no
use
to
try
to
restrict
finality
to
the
individuality
of
the
living
being
if
there
is
finality
in
the
world
of
life
it
includes
the
whole
of
life
in
a
single
indivisible
embrace
this
life
common
to
all
the
living
undoubtedly
presents
many
gaps
and
incoherences
and
again
it
is
not
so
mathematically
that
it
can
not
allow
each
being
to
become
individualized
to
a
certain
degree
but
it
forms
a
single
whole
none
the
less
and
we
have
to
choose
between
the
negation
of
finality
and
the
hypothesis
which
not
only
the
parts
of
an
organism
with
the
organism
itself
but
also
each
living
being
with
the
collective
whole
of
all
others
finality
will
not
go
down
any
easier
for
being
taken
as
a
powder
either
the
hypothesis
of
a
finality
immanent
in
life
should
be
rejected
as
a
whole
or
it
must
undergo
a
treatment
very
different
from
pulverization
the
error
of
radical
finalism
as
also
that
of
radical
mechanism
is
to
extend
too
far
the
application
of
certain
concepts
that
are
natural
to
our
intellect
originally
we
think
only
in
order
to
act
our
intellect
has
been
cast
in
the
mold
of
action
speculation
is
a
luxury
while
action
is
a
necessity
now
in
order
to
act
we
begin
by
proposing
an
end
we
make
a
plan
then
we
go
on
to
the
detail
of
the
mechanism
which
will
bring
it
to
pass
this
latter
operation
is
possible
only
if
we
know
what
we
can
reckon
on
we
must
therefore
have
managed
to
extract
resemblances
from
nature
which
enable
us
to
anticipate
the
future
thus
we
must
consciously
or
unconsciously
have
made
use
of
the
law
of
causality
moreover
the
more
sharply
the
idea
of
efficient
causality
is
defined
in
our
mind
the
more
it
takes
the
form
of
a
causality
and
this
scheme
in
its
turn
is
the
more
mathematical
according
as
it
expresses
a
more
rigorous
necessity
that
is
why
we
have
only
to
follow
the
bent
of
our
mind
to
become
mathematicians
but
on
the
other
hand
this
natural
mathematics
is
only
the
rigid
unconscious
skeleton
beneath
our
conscious
supple
habit
of
linking
the
same
causes
to
the
same
effects
and
the
usual
object
of
this
habit
is
to
guide
actions
inspired
by
intentions
or
what
comes
to
the
same
to
direct
movements
combined
with
a
view
to
reproducing
a
pattern
we
are
born
artisans
as
we
are
born
geometricians
and
indeed
we
are
geometricians
only
because
we
are
artisans
thus
the
human
intellect
inasmuch
as
it
is
fashioned
for
the
needs
of
human
action
is
an
intellect
which
proceeds
at
the
same
time
by
intention
and
by
calculation
by
adapting
means
to
ends
and
by
thinking
out
mechanisms
of
more
and
more
geometrical
form
whether
nature
be
conceived
as
an
immense
machine
regulated
by
mathematical
laws
or
as
the
realization
of
a
plan
these
two
ways
of
regarding
it
are
only
the
consummation
of
two
tendencies
of
mind
which
are
complementary
to
each
other
and
which
have
their
origin
in
the
same
vital
necessities
for
that
reason
radical
finalism
is
very
near
radical
mechanism
on
many
points
both
doctrines
are
reluctant
to
see
in
the
course
of
things
generally
or
even
simply
in
the
development
of
life
an
unforeseeable
creation
of
form
in
considering
reality
mechanism
regards
only
the
aspect
of
similarity
or
repetition
it
is
therefore
dominated
by
this
law
that
in
nature
there
is
only
reproducing
the
more
the
geometry
in
mechanism
is
emphasized
the
less
can
mechanism
admit
that
anything
is
ever
created
even
pure
form
in
so
far
as
we
are
geometricians
then
we
reject
the
unforeseeable
we
might
accept
it
assuredly
in
so
far
as
we
are
artists
for
art
lives
on
creation
and
implies
a
latent
belief
in
the
spontaneity
of
nature
but
disinterested
art
is
a
luxury
like
pure
speculation
long
before
being
artists
we
are
artisans
and
all
fabrication
however
rudimentary
lives
on
likeness
and
repetition
like
the
natural
geometry
which
serves
as
its
fulcrum
fabrication
works
on
models
which
it
sets
out
to
reproduce
and
even
when
it
invents
it
proceeds
or
imagines
itself
to
proceed
by
a
new
arrangement
of
elements
already
known
its
principle
is
that
we
must
have
like
to
produce
like
in
short
the
strict
application
of
the
principle
of
finality
like
that
of
the
principle
of
mechanical
causality
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
all
is
given
both
principles
say
the
same
thing
in
their
respective
languages
because
they
respond
to
the
same
need
that
is
why
again
they
agree
in
doing
away
with
time
real
duration
is
that
duration
which
gnaws
on
things
and
leaves
on
them
the
mark
of
its
tooth
if
everything
is
in
time
everything
changes
inwardly
and
the
same
concrete
reality
never
recurs
repetition
is
therefore
possible
only
in
the
abstract
what
is
repeated
is
some
aspect
that
our
senses
and
especially
our
intellect
have
singled
out
from
reality
just
because
our
action
upon
which
all
the
effort
of
our
intellect
is
directed
can
move
only
among
repetitions
thus
concentrated
on
that
which
repeats
solely
preoccupied
in
welding
the
same
to
the
same
intellect
turns
away
from
the
vision
of
time
it
dislikes
what
is
fluid
and
solidifies
everything
it
touches
we
do
not
real
time
but
we
it
because
life
transcends
intellect
the
feeling
we
have
of
our
evolution
and
of
the
evolution
of
all
things
in
pure
duration
is
there
forming
around
the
intellectual
concept
properly
an
indistinct
fringe
that
fades
off
into
darkness
mechanism
and
finalism
agree
in
taking
account
only
of
the
bright
nucleus
shining
in
the
centre
they
forget
that
this
nucleus
has
been
formed
out
of
the
rest
by
condensation
and
that
the
whole
must
be
used
the
fluid
as
well
as
and
more
than
the
condensed
in
order
to
grasp
the
inner
movement
of
life
indeed
if
the
fringe
exists
however
delicate
and
indistinct
it
should
have
more
importance
for
philosophy
than
the
bright
nucleus
it
surrounds
for
it
is
its
presence
that
enables
us
to
affirm
that
the
nucleus
is
a
nucleus
that
pure
intellect
is
a
contraction
by
condensation
of
a
more
extensive
power
and
just
because
this
vague
intuition
is
of
no
help
in
directing
our
action
on
things
which
action
takes
place
exclusively
on
the
surface
of
reality
we
may
presume
that
it
is
to
be
exercised
not
merely
on
the
surface
but
below
as
soon
as
we
go
out
of
the
encasings
in
which
radical
mechanism
and
radical
finalism
confine
our
thought
reality
appears
as
a
ceaseless
upspringing
of
something
new
which
has
no
sooner
arisen
to
make
the
present
than
it
has
already
fallen
back
into
the
past
at
this
exact
moment
it
falls
under
the
glance
of
the
intellect
whose
eyes
are
ever
turned
to
the
rear
this
is
already
the
case
with
our
inner
life
for
each
of
our
acts
we
shall
easily
find
antecedents
of
which
it
may
in
some
sort
be
said
to
be
the
mechanical
resultant
and
it
may
equally
well
be
said
that
each
action
is
the
realization
of
an
intention
in
this
sense
mechanism
is
everywhere
and
finality
everywhere
in
the
evolution
of
our
conduct
but
if
our
action
be
one
that
involves
the
whole
of
our
person
and
is
truly
ours
it
could
not
have
been
foreseen
even
though
its
antecedents
explain
it
when
once
it
has
been
accomplished
and
though
it
be
the
realizing
of
an
intention
it
differs
as
a
present
and
reality
from
the
intention
which
can
never
aim
at
anything
but
recommencing
or
rearranging
the
past
mechanism
and
finalism
are
therefore
here
only
external
views
of
our
conduct
they
extract
its
intellectuality
but
our
conduct
slips
between
them
and
extends
much
further
once
again
this
does
not
mean
that
free
action
is
capricious
unreasonable
action
to
behave
according
to
caprice
is
to
oscillate
mechanically
between
two
or
more
alternatives
and
at
length
to
settle
on
one
of
them
it
is
no
real
maturing
of
an
internal
state
no
real
evolution
it
is
merely
however
paradoxical
the
assertion
may
seem
bending
the
will
to
imitate
the
mechanism
of
the
intellect
a
conduct
that
is
truly
our
own
on
the
contrary
is
that
of
a
will
which
does
not
try
to
counterfeit
intellect
and
which
remaining
itself
that
is
to
say
evolving
ripens
gradually
into
acts
which
the
intellect
will
be
able
to
resolve
indefinitely
into
intelligible
elements
without
ever
reaching
its
goal
the
free
act
is
incommensurable
with
the
idea
and
its
rationality
must
be
defined
by
this
very
incommensurability
which
admits
the
discovery
of
as
much
intelligibility
within
it
as
we
will
such
is
the
character
of
our
own
evolution
and
such
also
without
doubt
that
of
the
evolution
of
life
our
reason
incorrigibly
presumptuous
imagines
itself
possessed
by
right
of
birth
or
by
right
of
conquest
innate
or
acquired
of
all
the
essential
elements
of
the
knowledge
of
truth
even
where
it
confesses
that
it
does
not
know
the
object
presented
to
it
it
believes
that
its
ignorance
consists
only
in
not
knowing
which
one
of
its
categories
suits
the
new
object
in
what
drawer
ready
to
open
shall
we
put
it
in
what
garment
already
cut
out
shall
we
clothe
it
is
it
this
or
that
or
the
other
thing
and
this
and
that
and
the
other
thing
are
always
something
already
conceived
already
known
the
idea
that
for
a
new
object
we
might
have
to
create
a
new
concept
perhaps
a
new
method
of
thinking
is
deeply
repugnant
to
us
the
history
of
philosophy
is
there
however
and
shows
us
the
eternal
conflict
of
systems
the
impossibility
of
satisfactorily
getting
the
real
into
the
garments
of
our
concepts
the
necessity
of
making
to
measure
but
rather
than
go
to
this
extremity
our
reason
prefers
to
announce
once
for
all
with
a
proud
modesty
that
it
has
to
do
only
with
the
relative
and
that
the
absolute
is
not
in
its
province
this
preliminary
declaration
enables
it
to
apply
its
habitual
method
of
thought
without
any
scruple
and
thus
under
pretense
that
it
does
not
touch
the
absolute
to
make
absolute
judgments
upon
everything
plato
was
the
first
to
set
up
the
theory
that
to
know
the
real
consists
in
finding
its
idea
that
is
to
say
in
forcing
it
into
a
frame
already
at
our
disposal
as
if
we
implicitly
possessed
universal
knowledge
but
this
belief
is
natural
to
the
human
intellect
always
engaged
as
it
is
in
determining
under
what
former
heading
it
shall
catalogue
any
new
object
and
it
may
be
said
that
in
a
certain
sense
we
are
all
born
platonists
nowhere
is
the
inadequacy
of
this
method
so
obvious
as
in
theories
of
life
if
in
evolving
in
the
direction
of
the
vertebrates
in
general
of
man
and
intellect
in
particular
life
has
had
to
abandon
by
the
way
many
elements
incompatible
with
this
particular
mode
of
organization
and
consign
them
as
we
shall
show
to
other
lines
of
development
it
is
the
totality
of
these
elements
that
we
must
find
again
and
rejoin
to
the
intellect
proper
in
order
to
grasp
the
true
nature
of
vital
activity
and
we
shall
probably
be
aided
in
this
by
the
fringe
of
vague
intuition
that
surrounds
our
distinct
that
is
intellectual
representation
for
what
can
this
useless
fringe
be
if
not
that
part
of
the
evolving
principle
which
has
not
shrunk
to
the
peculiar
form
of
our
organization
but
has
settled
around
it
unasked
for
unwanted
it
is
there
accordingly
that
we
must
look
for
hints
to
expand
the
intellectual
form
of
our
thought
from
there
shall
we
derive
the
impetus
necessary
to
lift
us
above
ourselves
to
form
an
idea
of
the
whole
of
life
can
not
consist
in
combining
simple
ideas
that
have
been
left
behind
in
us
by
life
itself
in
the
course
of
its
evolution
how
could
the
part
be
equivalent
to
the
whole
the
content
to
the
container
a
of
the
vital
operation
to
the
operation
itself
such
however
is
our
illusion
when
we
define
the
evolution
of
life
as
a
passage
from
the
homogeneous
to
the
heterogeneous
or
by
any
other
concept
obtained
by
putting
fragments
of
intellect
side
by
side
we
place
ourselves
in
one
of
the
points
where
evolution
comes
to
a
head
the
principal
one
no
doubt
but
not
the
only
one
and
there
we
do
not
even
take
all
we
find
for
of
the
intellect
we
keep
only
one
or
two
of
the
concepts
by
which
it
expresses
itself
and
it
is
this
part
of
a
part
that
we
declare
representative
of
the
whole
of
something
indeed
which
goes
beyond
the
concrete
whole
i
mean
of
the
evolution
movement
of
which
this
whole
is
only
the
present
stage
the
truth
is
that
to
represent
this
the
entire
intellect
would
not
be
too
much
nay
it
would
not
be
enough
it
would
be
necessary
to
add
to
it
what
we
find
in
every
other
terminal
point
of
evolution
and
these
diverse
and
divergent
elements
must
be
considered
as
so
many
extracts
which
are
or
at
least
which
were
in
their
humblest
form
mutually
complementary
only
then
might
we
have
an
inkling
of
the
real
nature
of
the
evolution
movement
and
even
then
we
should
fail
to
grasp
it
completely
for
we
should
still
be
dealing
only
with
the
evolved
which
is
a
result
and
not
with
evolution
itself
which
is
the
act
by
which
the
result
is
obtained
such
is
the
philosophy
of
life
to
which
we
are
leading
up
it
claims
to
transcend
both
mechanism
and
finalism
but
as
we
announced
at
the
beginning
it
is
nearer
the
second
doctrine
than
the
first
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
dwell
on
this
point
and
show
more
precisely
how
far
this
philosophy
of
life
resembles
finalism
and
wherein
it
is
different
like
radical
finalism
although
in
a
vaguer
form
our
philosophy
represents
the
organized
world
as
a
harmonious
whole
but
this
harmony
is
far
from
being
as
perfect
as
it
has
been
claimed
to
be
it
admits
of
much
discord
because
each
species
each
individual
even
retains
only
a
certain
impetus
from
the
universal
vital
impulsion
and
tends
to
use
this
energy
in
its
own
interest
in
this
consists
the
species
and
the
individual
thus
think
only
of
themselves
whence
arises
a
possible
conflict
with
other
forms
of
life
harmony
therefore
does
not
exist
in
fact
it
exists
rather
in
principle
i
mean
that
the
original
impetus
is
a
impetus
and
the
higher
we
ascend
the
stream
of
life
the
more
do
diverse
tendencies
appear
complementary
to
each
other
thus
the
wind
at
a
divides
into
diverging
currents
which
are
all
one
and
the
same
gust
harmony
or
rather
complementarity
is
revealed
only
in
the
mass
in
tendencies
rather
than
in
states
especially
and
this
is
the
point
on
which
finalism
has
been
most
seriously
mistaken
harmony
is
rather
behind
us
than
before
it
is
due
to
an
identity
of
impulsion
and
not
to
a
common
aspiration
it
would
be
futile
to
try
to
assign
to
life
an
end
in
the
human
sense
of
the
word
to
speak
of
an
end
is
to
think
of
a
model
which
has
only
to
be
realized
it
is
to
suppose
therefore
that
all
is
given
and
that
the
future
can
be
read
in
the
present
it
is
to
believe
that
life
in
its
movement
and
in
its
entirety
goes
to
work
like
our
intellect
which
is
only
a
motionless
and
fragmentary
view
of
life
and
which
naturally
takes
its
stand
outside
of
time
life
on
the
contrary
progresses
and
in
time
of
course
when
once
the
road
has
been
traveled
we
can
glance
over
it
mark
its
direction
note
this
in
psychological
terms
and
speak
as
if
there
had
been
pursuit
of
an
end
thus
shall
we
speak
ourselves
but
of
the
road
which
was
going
to
be
traveled
the
human
mind
could
have
nothing
to
say
for
the
road
has
been
created
with
the
act
of
traveling
over
it
being
nothing
but
the
direction
of
this
act
itself
at
every
instant
then
evolution
must
admit
of
a
psychological
interpretation
which
is
from
our
point
of
view
the
best
interpretation
but
this
explanation
has
neither
value
nor
even
significance
except
retrospectively
never
could
the
finalistic
interpretation
such
as
we
shall
propose
it
be
taken
for
an
anticipation
of
the
future
it
is
a
particular
mode
of
viewing
the
past
in
the
light
of
the
present
in
short
the
classic
conception
of
finality
postulates
at
once
too
much
and
too
little
it
is
both
too
wide
and
too
narrow
in
explaining
life
by
intellect
it
limits
too
much
the
meaning
of
life
intellect
such
at
least
as
we
find
it
in
ourselves
has
been
fashioned
by
evolution
during
the
course
of
progress
it
is
cut
out
of
something
larger
or
rather
it
is
only
the
projection
necessarily
on
a
plane
of
a
reality
that
possesses
both
relief
and
depth
it
is
this
more
comprehensive
reality
that
true
finalism
ought
to
reconstruct
or
rather
if
possible
embrace
in
one
view
but
on
the
other
hand
just
because
it
goes
beyond
intellect
the
faculty
of
connecting
the
same
with
the
same
of
perceiving
and
also
of
producing
repetitions
this
reality
is
undoubtedly
creative
productive
of
effects
in
which
it
expands
and
transcends
its
own
being
these
effects
were
therefore
not
given
in
it
in
advance
and
so
it
could
not
take
them
for
ends
although
when
once
produced
they
admit
of
a
rational
interpretation
like
that
of
the
manufactured
article
that
has
reproduced
a
model
in
short
the
theory
of
final
causes
does
not
go
far
enough
when
it
confines
itself
to
ascribing
some
intelligence
to
nature
and
it
goes
too
far
when
it
supposes
a
of
the
future
in
the
present
in
the
form
of
idea
and
the
second
theory
which
sins
by
excess
is
the
outcome
of
the
first
which
sins
by
defect
in
place
of
intellect
proper
must
be
substituted
the
more
comprehensive
reality
of
which
intellect
is
only
the
contraction
the
future
then
appears
as
expanding
the
present
it
was
not
therefore
contained
in
the
present
in
the
form
of
a
represented
end
and
yet
once
realized
it
will
explain
the
present
as
much
as
the
present
explains
it
and
even
more
it
must
be
viewed
as
an
end
as
much
as
and
more
than
a
result
our
intellect
has
a
right
to
consider
the
future
abstractly
from
its
habitual
point
of
view
being
itself
an
abstract
view
of
the
cause
of
its
own
being
it
is
true
that
the
cause
may
then
seem
beyond
our
grasp
already
the
finalist
theory
of
life
eludes
all
precise
verification
what
if
we
go
beyond
it
in
one
of
its
directions
here
in
fact
after
a
necessary
digression
we
are
back
at
the
question
which
we
regard
as
essential
can
the
insufficiency
of
mechanism
be
proved
by
facts
we
said
that
if
this
demonstration
is
possible
it
is
on
condition
of
frankly
accepting
the
evolutionist
hypothesis
we
must
now
show
that
if
mechanism
is
insufficient
to
account
for
evolution
the
way
of
proving
this
insufficiency
is
not
to
stop
at
the
classic
conception
of
finality
still
less
to
contract
or
attenuate
it
but
on
the
contrary
to
go
further
let
us
indicate
at
once
the
principle
of
our
demonstration
we
said
of
life
that
from
its
origin
it
is
the
continuation
of
one
and
the
same
impetus
divided
into
divergent
lines
of
evolution
something
has
grown
something
has
developed
by
a
series
of
additions
which
have
been
so
many
creations
this
very
development
has
brought
about
a
dissociation
of
tendencies
which
were
unable
to
grow
beyond
a
certain
point
without
becoming
mutually
incompatible
strictly
speaking
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
our
imagining
that
the
evolution
of
life
might
have
taken
place
in
one
single
individual
by
means
of
a
series
of
transformations
spread
over
thousands
of
ages
or
instead
of
a
single
individual
any
number
might
be
supposed
succeeding
each
other
in
a
unilinear
series
in
both
cases
evolution
would
have
had
so
to
speak
one
dimension
only
but
evolution
has
actually
taken
place
through
millions
of
individuals
on
divergent
lines
each
ending
at
a
crossing
from
which
new
paths
radiate
and
so
on
indefinitely
if
our
hypothesis
is
justified
if
the
essential
causes
working
along
these
diverse
roads
are
of
psychological
nature
they
must
keep
something
in
common
in
spite
of
the
divergence
of
their
effects
as
long
separated
keep
the
same
memories
of
boyhood
roads
may
fork
or
be
opened
along
which
dissociated
elements
may
evolve
in
an
independent
manner
but
nevertheless
it
is
in
virtue
of
the
primitive
impetus
of
the
whole
that
the
movement
of
the
parts
continues
something
of
the
whole
therefore
must
abide
in
the
parts
and
this
common
element
will
be
evident
to
us
in
some
way
perhaps
by
the
presence
of
identical
organs
in
very
different
organisms
suppose
for
an
instant
that
the
mechanistic
explanation
is
the
true
one
evolution
must
then
have
occurred
through
a
series
of
accidents
added
to
one
another
each
new
accident
being
preserved
by
selection
if
it
is
advantageous
to
that
sum
of
former
advantageous
accidents
which
the
present
form
of
the
living
being
represents
what
likelihood
is
there
that
by
two
entirely
different
series
of
accidents
being
added
together
two
entirely
different
evolutions
will
arrive
at
similar
results
the
more
two
lines
of
evolution
diverge
the
less
probability
is
there
that
accidental
outer
influences
or
accidental
inner
variations
bring
about
the
construction
of
the
same
apparatus
upon
them
especially
if
there
was
no
trace
of
this
apparatus
at
the
moment
of
divergence
but
such
similarity
of
the
two
products
would
be
natural
on
the
contrary
on
a
hypothesis
like
ours
even
in
the
latest
channel
there
would
be
something
of
the
impulsion
received
at
the
source
mechanism
then
would
be
refutable
and
finality
in
the
special
sense
in
which
we
understand
it
would
be
demonstrable
in
a
certain
aspect
if
it
could
be
proved
that
life
may
manufacture
the
like
apparatus
by
unlike
means
on
divergent
lines
of
evolution
and
the
strength
of
the
proof
would
be
proportional
both
to
the
divergency
between
the
lines
of
evolution
thus
chosen
and
to
the
complexity
of
the
similar
structures
found
in
it
will
be
said
that
resemblance
of
structure
is
due
to
sameness
of
the
general
conditions
in
which
life
has
evolved
and
that
these
permanent
outer
conditions
may
have
imposed
the
same
direction
on
the
forces
constructing
this
or
that
apparatus
in
spite
of
the
diversity
of
transient
outer
influences
and
accidental
inner
changes
we
are
not
of
course
blind
to
the
rôle
which
the
concept
of
plays
in
the
science
of
biologists
certainly
do
not
all
make
the
same
use
of
it
some
think
the
outer
conditions
capable
of
causing
change
in
organisms
in
a
manner
in
a
definite
direction
through
alterations
induced
by
them
in
the
living
substance
such
is
the
hypothesis
of
eimer
for
example
others
more
faithful
to
the
spirit
of
darwinism
believe
the
influence
of
conditions
works
only
through
favoring
in
the
struggle
for
life
those
representatives
of
a
species
which
the
chance
of
birth
has
best
adapted
to
the
environment
in
other
words
some
attribute
a
influence
to
outer
conditions
and
say
that
they
actually
rise
variations
while
the
others
say
these
conditions
have
only
a
influence
and
merely
variations
but
in
both
cases
the
outer
conditions
are
supposed
to
bring
about
a
precise
adjustment
of
the
organism
to
its
circumstances
both
parties
then
will
attempt
to
explain
mechanically
by
adaptation
to
similar
conditions
the
similarities
of
structure
which
we
think
are
the
strongest
argument
against
mechanism
so
we
must
at
once
indicate
in
a
general
way
before
passing
to
the
detail
why
explanations
from
adaptation
seem
to
us
insufficient
let
us
first
remark
that
of
the
two
hypotheses
just
described
the
latter
is
the
only
one
which
is
not
equivocal
the
darwinian
idea
of
adaptation
by
automatic
elimination
of
the
unadapted
is
a
simple
and
clear
idea
but
just
because
it
attributes
to
the
outer
cause
which
controls
evolution
a
merely
negative
influence
it
has
great
difficulty
in
accounting
for
the
progressive
and
so
to
say
rectilinear
development
of
complex
apparatus
such
as
we
are
about
to
examine
how
much
greater
will
this
difficulty
be
in
the
case
of
the
similar
structure
of
two
extremely
complex
organs
on
two
entirely
different
lines
of
evolution
an
accidental
variation
however
minute
implies
the
working
of
a
great
number
of
small
physical
and
chemical
causes
an
accumulation
of
accidental
variations
such
as
would
be
necessary
to
produce
a
complex
structure
requires
therefore
the
concurrence
of
an
almost
infinite
number
of
infinitesimal
causes
why
should
these
causes
entirely
accidental
recur
the
same
and
in
the
same
order
at
different
points
of
space
and
time
no
one
will
hold
that
this
is
the
case
and
the
darwinian
himself
will
probably
merely
maintain
that
identical
effects
may
arise
from
different
causes
that
more
than
one
road
leads
to
the
same
spot
but
let
us
not
be
fooled
by
a
metaphor
the
place
reached
does
not
give
the
form
of
the
road
that
leads
there
while
an
organic
structure
is
just
the
accumulation
of
those
small
differences
which
evolution
has
had
to
go
through
in
order
to
achieve
it
the
struggle
for
life
and
natural
selection
can
be
of
no
use
to
us
in
solving
this
part
of
the
problem
for
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
what
has
perished
we
have
to
do
only
with
what
has
survived
now
we
see
that
identical
structures
have
been
formed
on
independent
lines
of
evolution
by
a
gradual
accumulation
of
effects
how
can
accidental
causes
occurring
in
an
accidental
order
be
supposed
to
have
repeatedly
come
to
the
same
result
the
causes
being
infinitely
numerous
and
the
effect
infinitely
complicated
the
principle
of
mechanism
is
that
the
same
causes
produce
the
same
effects
this
principle
of
course
does
not
always
imply
that
the
same
effects
must
have
the
same
causes
but
it
does
involve
this
consequence
in
the
particular
case
in
which
the
causes
remain
visible
in
the
effect
that
they
produce
and
are
indeed
its
constitutive
elements
that
two
walkers
starting
from
different
points
and
wandering
at
random
should
finally
meet
is
no
great
wonder
but
that
throughout
their
walk
they
should
describe
two
identical
curves
exactly
superposable
on
each
other
is
altogether
unlikely
the
improbability
will
be
the
greater
the
more
complicated
the
routes
and
it
will
become
impossibility
if
the
zigzags
are
infinitely
complicated
now
what
is
this
complexity
of
zigzags
as
compared
with
that
of
an
organ
in
which
thousands
of
different
cells
each
being
itself
a
kind
of
organism
are
arranged
in
a
definite
order
let
us
turn
then
to
the
other
hypothesis
and
see
how
it
would
solve
the
problem
adaptation
it
says
is
not
merely
elimination
of
the
unadapted
it
is
due
to
the
positive
influence
of
outer
conditions
that
have
molded
the
organism
on
their
own
form
this
time
similarity
of
effects
will
be
explained
by
similarity
of
cause
we
shall
remain
apparently
in
pure
mechanism
but
if
we
look
closely
we
shall
see
that
the
explanation
is
merely
verbal
that
we
are
again
the
dupes
of
words
and
that
the
trick
of
the
solution
consists
in
taking
the
term
adaptation
in
two
entirely
different
senses
at
the
same
time
if
i
pour
into
the
same
glass
by
turns
water
and
wine
the
two
liquids
will
take
the
same
form
and
the
sameness
in
form
will
be
due
to
the
sameness
in
adaptation
of
content
to
container
adaptation
here
really
means
mechanical
adjustment
the
reason
is
that
the
form
to
which
the
matter
has
adapted
itself
was
there
and
has
forced
its
own
shape
on
the
matter
but
in
the
adaptation
of
an
organism
to
the
circumstances
it
has
to
live
in
where
is
the
form
awaiting
its
matter
the
circumstances
are
not
a
mold
into
which
life
is
inserted
and
whose
form
life
adopts
this
is
indeed
to
be
fooled
by
a
metaphor
there
is
no
form
yet
and
the
life
must
create
a
form
for
itself
suited
to
the
circumstances
which
are
made
for
it
it
will
have
to
make
the
best
of
these
circumstances
neutralize
their
inconveniences
and
utilize
their
advantages
in
short
respond
to
outer
actions
by
building
up
a
machine
which
has
no
resemblance
to
them
such
adapting
is
not
but
an
entirely
different
thing
if
there
is
still
adaptation
it
will
be
in
the
sense
in
which
one
may
say
of
the
solution
of
a
problem
of
geometry
for
example
that
it
is
adapted
to
the
conditions
i
grant
indeed
that
adaptation
so
understood
explains
why
different
evolutionary
processes
result
in
similar
forms
the
same
problem
of
course
calls
for
the
same
solution
but
it
is
necessary
then
to
introduce
as
for
the
solution
of
a
problem
of
geometry
an
intelligent
activity
or
at
least
a
cause
which
behaves
in
the
same
way
this
is
to
bring
in
finality
again
and
a
finality
this
time
more
than
ever
charged
with
anthropomorphic
elements
in
a
word
if
the
adaptation
is
passive
if
it
is
mere
repetition
in
the
relief
of
what
the
conditions
give
in
the
mold
it
will
build
up
nothing
that
one
tries
to
make
it
build
and
if
it
is
active
capable
of
responding
by
a
calculated
solution
to
the
problem
which
is
set
out
in
the
conditions
that
is
going
further
than
we
do
too
far
indeed
in
our
opinion
in
the
direction
we
indicated
in
the
beginning
but
the
truth
is
that
there
is
a
surreptitious
passing
from
one
of
these
two
meanings
to
the
other
a
flight
for
refuge
to
the
first
whenever
one
is
about
to
be
caught
flagrante
of
finalism
by
employing
the
second
it
is
really
the
second
which
serves
the
usual
practice
of
science
but
it
is
the
first
that
generally
provides
its
philosophy
in
any
case
one
talks
as
if
the
process
of
adaptation
were
an
effort
of
the
organism
to
build
up
a
machine
capable
of
turning
external
circumstances
to
the
best
possible
account
then
one
speaks
of
adaptation
as
if
it
were
the
very
impress
of
circumstances
passively
received
by
an
indifferent
matter
but
let
us
come
to
the
examples
it
would
be
interesting
first
to
institute
here
a
general
comparison
between
plants
and
animals
one
can
not
fail
to
be
struck
with
the
parallel
progress
which
has
been
accomplished
on
both
sides
in
the
direction
of
sexuality
not
only
is
fecundation
itself
the
same
in
higher
plants
and
in
animals
since
it
consists
in
both
in
the
union
of
two
nuclei
that
differ
in
their
properties
and
structure
before
their
union
and
immediately
after
become
equivalent
to
each
other
but
the
preparation
of
sexual
elements
goes
on
in
both
under
like
conditions
it
consists
essentially
in
the
reduction
of
the
number
of
chromosomes
and
the
rejection
of
a
certain
quantity
of
chromatic
substance
yet
vegetables
and
animals
have
evolved
on
independent
lines
favored
by
unlike
circumstances
opposed
by
unlike
obstacles
here
are
two
great
series
which
have
gone
on
diverging
on
either
line
thousands
and
thousands
of
causes
have
combined
to
determine
the
morphological
and
functional
evolution
yet
these
infinitely
complicated
causes
have
been
consummated
in
each
series
in
the
same
effect
and
this
effect
could
hardly
be
called
a
phenomenon
of
adaptation
where
is
the
adaptation
where
is
the
pressure
of
external
circumstances
there
is
no
striking
utility
in
sexual
generation
it
has
been
interpreted
in
the
most
diverse
ways
and
some
very
acute
enquirers
even
regard
the
sexuality
of
the
plant
at
least
as
a
luxury
which
nature
might
have
dispensed
with
but
we
do
not
wish
to
dwell
on
facts
so
disputed
the
ambiguity
of
the
term
adaptation
and
the
necessity
of
transcending
both
the
point
of
view
of
mechanical
causality
and
that
of
anthropomorphic
finality
will
stand
out
more
clearly
with
simpler
examples
at
all
times
the
doctrine
of
finality
has
laid
much
stress
on
the
marvellous
structure
of
the
in
order
to
liken
the
work
of
nature
to
that
of
an
intelligent
workman
now
since
these
organs
are
found
in
a
rudimentary
state
in
the
lower
animals
and
since
nature
offers
us
many
intermediaries
between
the
of
the
simplest
organisms
and
the
infinitely
complex
eye
of
the
vertebrates
it
may
just
as
well
be
alleged
that
the
result
has
been
brought
about
by
natural
selection
perfecting
the
organ
automatically
in
short
if
there
is
a
case
in
which
it
seems
justifiable
to
invoke
adaptation
it
is
this
particular
one
for
there
may
be
discussion
about
the
function
and
meaning
of
such
a
thing
as
sexual
generation
in
so
far
as
it
is
related
to
the
conditions
in
which
it
occurs
but
the
relation
of
the
eye
to
light
is
obvious
and
when
we
call
this
relation
an
adaptation
we
must
know
what
we
mean
if
then
we
can
show
in
this
privileged
case
the
insufficiency
of
the
principles
invoked
on
both
sides
our
demonstration
will
at
once
have
reached
a
high
degree
of
generality
let
us
consider
the
example
on
which
the
advocates
of
finality
have
always
insisted
the
structure
of
such
an
organ
as
the
human
eye
they
have
had
no
difficulty
in
showing
that
in
this
extremely
complicated
apparatus
all
the
elements
are
marvelously
in
order
that
vision
shall
operate
says
the
author
of
a
book
on
the
sclerotic
membrane
must
become
transparent
in
one
point
of
its
surface
so
as
to
enable
luminous
rays
to
pierce
it
the
cornea
must
correspond
exactly
with
the
opening
of
the
socket
behind
this
transparent
opening
there
must
be
refracting
media
there
must
be
a
retina
at
the
extremity
of
the
dark
chamber
perpendicular
to
the
retina
there
must
be
an
innumerable
quantity
of
transparent
cones
permitting
only
the
light
directed
in
the
line
of
their
axes
to
reach
the
nervous
membrane
etc
etc
in
reply
the
advocate
of
final
causes
has
been
invited
to
assume
the
evolutionist
hypothesis
everything
is
marvelous
indeed
if
one
consider
an
eye
like
ours
in
which
thousands
of
elements
are
coördinated
in
a
single
function
but
take
the
function
at
its
origin
in
the
infusorian
where
it
is
reduced
to
the
mere
impressionability
almost
purely
chemical
of
a
to
light
this
function
possibly
only
an
accidental
fact
in
the
beginning
may
have
brought
about
a
slight
complication
of
the
organ
which
again
induced
an
improvement
of
the
function
it
may
have
done
this
either
directly
through
some
unknown
mechanism
or
indirectly
merely
through
the
effect
of
the
advantages
it
brought
to
the
living
being
and
the
hold
it
thus
offered
to
natural
selection
thus
the
progressive
formation
of
an
eye
as
well
contrived
as
ours
would
be
explained
by
an
almost
infinite
number
of
actions
and
reactions
between
the
function
and
the
organ
without
the
intervention
of
other
than
mechanical
causes
the
question
is
hard
to
decide
indeed
when
put
directly
between
the
function
and
the
organ
as
is
done
in
the
doctrine
of
finality
as
also
mechanism
itself
does
for
organ
and
function
are
terms
of
different
nature
and
each
conditions
the
other
so
closely
that
it
is
impossible
to
say
whether
in
expressing
their
relation
we
should
begin
with
the
first
as
does
mechanism
or
with
the
second
as
finalism
requires
but
the
discussion
would
take
an
entirely
different
turn
we
think
if
we
began
by
comparing
together
two
terms
of
the
same
nature
an
organ
with
an
organ
instead
of
an
organ
with
its
function
in
this
case
it
would
be
possible
to
proceed
little
by
little
to
a
solution
more
and
more
plausible
and
there
would
be
the
more
chance
of
a
successful
issue
the
more
resolutely
we
assumed
the
evolutionist
hypothesis
let
us
place
side
by
side
the
eye
of
a
vertebrate
and
that
of
a
mollusc
such
as
the
common
pecten
we
find
the
same
essential
parts
in
each
composed
of
analogous
elements
the
eye
of
the
pecten
presents
a
retina
a
cornea
a
lens
of
cellular
structure
like
our
own
there
is
even
that
peculiar
inversion
of
retinal
elements
which
is
not
met
with
in
general
in
the
retina
of
the
invertebrates
now
the
origin
of
molluscs
may
be
a
debated
question
but
whatever
opinion
we
hold
all
are
agreed
that
molluscs
and
vertebrates
separated
from
their
common
long
before
the
appearance
of
an
eye
so
complex
as
that
of
the
pecten
whence
then
the
structural
analogy
let
us
question
on
this
point
the
two
opposed
systems
of
evolutionist
explanation
in
turn
the
hypothesis
of
purely
accidental
variations
and
that
of
a
variation
directed
in
a
definite
way
under
the
influence
of
external
conditions
the
first
as
is
well
known
is
presented
in
two
quite
different
forms
darwin
spoke
of
very
slight
variations
being
accumulated
by
natural
selection
he
was
not
ignorant
of
the
facts
of
sudden
variation
but
he
thought
these
sports
as
he
called
them
were
only
monstrosities
incapable
of
perpetuating
themselves
and
he
accounted
for
the
genesis
of
species
by
an
accumulation
of
variations
such
is
still
the
opinion
of
many
naturalists
it
is
tending
however
to
give
way
to
the
opposite
idea
that
a
new
species
comes
into
being
all
at
once
by
the
simultaneous
appearance
of
several
new
characters
all
somewhat
different
from
the
previous
ones
this
latter
hypothesis
already
proposed
by
various
authors
notably
by
bateson
in
a
remarkable
book
has
become
deeply
significant
and
acquired
great
force
since
the
striking
experiments
of
hugo
de
vries
this
botanist
working
on
the
obtained
at
the
end
of
a
few
generations
a
certain
number
of
new
species
the
theory
he
deduces
from
his
experiments
is
of
the
highest
interest
species
pass
through
alternate
periods
of
stability
and
transformation
when
the
period
of
mutability
occurs
unexpected
forms
spring
forth
in
a
great
number
of
different
directions
we
will
not
attempt
to
take
sides
between
this
hypothesis
and
that
of
insensible
variations
indeed
perhaps
both
are
partly
true
we
wish
merely
to
point
out
that
if
the
variations
invoked
are
accidental
they
do
not
whether
small
or
great
account
for
a
similarity
of
structure
such
as
we
have
cited
let
us
assume
to
begin
with
the
darwinian
theory
of
insensible
variations
and
suppose
the
occurrence
of
small
differences
due
to
chance
and
continually
accumulating
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
all
the
parts
of
an
organism
are
necessarily
coördinated
whether
the
function
be
the
effect
of
the
organ
or
its
cause
it
matters
little
one
point
is
certain
the
organ
will
be
of
no
use
and
will
not
give
selection
a
hold
unless
it
functions
however
the
minute
structure
of
the
retina
may
develop
and
however
complicated
it
may
become
such
progress
instead
of
favoring
vision
will
probably
hinder
it
if
the
visual
centres
do
not
develop
at
the
same
time
as
well
as
several
parts
of
the
visual
organ
itself
if
the
variations
are
accidental
how
can
they
ever
agree
to
arise
in
every
part
of
the
organ
at
the
same
time
in
such
way
that
the
organ
will
continue
to
perform
its
function
darwin
quite
understood
this
it
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
he
regarded
variation
as
insensible
for
a
difference
which
arises
accidentally
at
one
point
of
the
visual
apparatus
if
it
be
very
slight
will
not
hinder
the
functioning
of
the
organ
and
hence
this
first
accidental
variation
can
in
a
sense
complementary
variations
to
accumulate
and
raise
vision
to
a
higher
degree
of
perfection
granted
but
while
the
insensible
variation
does
not
hinder
the
functioning
of
the
eye
neither
does
it
help
it
so
long
as
the
variations
that
are
complementary
do
not
occur
how
in
that
case
can
the
variation
be
retained
by
natural
selection
unwittingly
one
will
reason
as
if
the
slight
variation
were
a
toothing
stone
set
up
by
the
organism
and
reserved
for
a
later
construction
this
hypothesis
so
little
conformable
to
the
darwinian
principle
is
difficult
enough
to
avoid
even
in
the
case
of
an
organ
which
has
been
developed
along
one
single
main
line
of
evolution
the
vertebrate
eye
but
it
is
absolutely
forced
upon
us
when
we
observe
the
likeness
of
structure
of
the
vertebrate
eye
and
that
of
the
molluscs
how
could
the
same
small
variations
incalculable
in
number
have
ever
occurred
in
the
same
order
on
two
independent
lines
of
evolution
if
they
were
purely
accidental
and
how
could
they
have
been
preserved
by
selection
and
accumulated
in
both
cases
the
same
in
the
same
order
when
each
of
them
taken
separately
was
of
no
use
let
us
turn
then
to
the
hypothesis
of
sudden
variations
and
see
whether
it
will
solve
the
problem
it
certainly
lessens
the
difficulty
on
one
point
but
it
makes
it
much
worse
on
another
if
the
eye
of
the
mollusc
and
that
of
the
vertebrate
have
both
been
raised
to
their
present
form
by
a
relatively
small
number
of
sudden
leaps
i
have
less
difficulty
in
understanding
the
resemblance
of
the
two
organs
than
if
this
resemblance
were
due
to
an
incalculable
number
of
infinitesimal
resemblances
acquired
successively
in
both
cases
it
is
chance
that
operates
but
in
the
second
case
chance
is
not
required
to
work
the
miracle
it
would
have
to
perform
in
the
first
not
only
is
the
number
of
resemblances
to
be
added
somewhat
reduced
but
i
can
also
understand
better
how
each
could
be
preserved
and
added
to
the
others
for
the
elementary
variation
is
now
considerable
enough
to
be
an
advantage
to
the
living
being
and
so
to
lend
itself
to
the
play
of
selection
but
here
there
arises
another
problem
no
less
formidable
how
do
all
the
parts
of
the
visual
apparatus
suddenly
changed
remain
so
well
coördinated
that
the
eye
continues
to
exercise
its
function
for
the
change
of
one
part
alone
will
make
vision
impossible
unless
this
change
is
absolutely
infinitesimal
the
parts
must
then
all
change
at
once
each
consulting
the
others
i
agree
that
a
great
number
of
uncoördinated
variations
may
indeed
have
arisen
in
less
fortunate
individuals
that
natural
selection
may
have
eliminated
these
and
that
only
the
combination
fit
to
endure
capable
of
preserving
and
improving
vision
has
survived
still
this
combination
had
to
be
produced
and
supposing
chance
to
have
granted
this
favor
once
can
we
admit
that
it
repeats
the
favor
in
the
course
of
the
history
of
a
species
so
as
to
give
rise
every
time
all
at
once
to
new
complications
marvelously
regulated
with
reference
to
each
other
and
so
related
to
former
complications
as
to
go
further
on
in
the
same
direction
how
especially
can
we
suppose
that
by
a
series
of
mere
accidents
these
sudden
variations
occur
the
same
in
the
same
order
involving
in
each
case
a
perfect
harmony
of
elements
more
and
more
numerous
and
complex
along
two
independent
lines
of
evolution
the
law
of
correlation
will
be
invoked
of
course
darwin
himself
appealed
to
it
it
will
be
alleged
that
a
change
is
not
localized
in
a
single
point
of
the
organism
but
has
its
necessary
recoil
on
other
points
the
examples
cited
by
darwin
remain
classic
white
cats
with
blue
eyes
are
generally
deaf
hairless
dogs
have
imperfect
dentition
granted
but
let
us
not
play
now
on
the
word
correlation
a
collective
whole
of
changes
is
one
thing
a
system
of
changes
changes
so
coördinated
as
to
keep
up
and
even
improve
the
functioning
of
an
organ
under
more
complicated
conditions
is
another
that
an
anomaly
of
the
pilous
system
should
be
accompanied
by
an
anomaly
of
dentition
is
quite
conceivable
without
our
having
to
call
for
a
special
principle
of
explanation
for
hair
and
teeth
are
similar
formations
and
the
same
chemical
change
of
the
germ
that
hinders
the
formation
of
hair
would
probably
obstruct
that
of
teeth
it
may
be
for
the
same
sort
of
reason
that
white
cats
with
blue
eyes
are
deaf
in
these
different
examples
the
correlative
changes
are
only
changes
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
they
are
really
namely
diminutions
or
suppressions
and
not
additions
which
makes
a
great
difference
but
when
we
speak
of
correlative
changes
occurring
suddenly
in
the
different
parts
of
the
eye
we
use
the
word
in
an
entirely
new
sense
this
time
there
is
a
whole
set
of
changes
not
only
simultaneous
not
only
bound
together
by
community
of
origin
but
so
coördinated
that
the
organ
keeps
on
performing
the
same
simple
function
and
even
performs
it
better
that
a
change
in
the
germ
which
influences
the
formation
of
the
retina
may
affect
at
the
same
time
also
the
formation
of
the
cornea
the
iris
the
lens
the
visual
centres
i
admit
if
necessary
although
they
are
formations
that
differ
much
more
from
one
another
in
their
original
nature
than
do
probably
hair
and
teeth
but
that
all
these
simultaneous
changes
should
occur
in
such
a
way
as
to
improve
or
even
merely
maintain
vision
this
is
what
in
the
hypothesis
of
sudden
variation
i
can
not
admit
unless
a
mysterious
principle
is
to
come
in
whose
duty
it
is
to
watch
over
the
interest
of
the
function
but
this
would
be
to
give
up
the
idea
of
accidental
variation
in
reality
these
two
senses
of
the
word
correlation
are
often
interchanged
in
the
mind
of
the
biologist
just
like
the
two
senses
of
the
word
adaptation
and
the
confusion
is
almost
legitimate
in
botany
that
science
in
which
the
theory
of
the
formation
of
species
by
sudden
variation
rests
on
the
firmest
experimental
basis
in
vegetables
function
is
far
less
narrowly
bound
to
form
than
in
animals
even
profound
morphological
differences
such
as
a
change
in
the
form
of
leaves
have
no
appreciable
influence
on
the
exercise
of
function
and
so
do
not
require
a
whole
system
of
complementary
changes
for
the
plant
to
remain
fit
to
survive
but
it
is
not
so
in
the
animal
especially
in
the
case
of
an
organ
like
the
eye
a
very
complex
structure
and
very
delicate
function
here
it
is
impossible
to
identify
changes
that
are
simply
solidary
with
changes
which
are
also
complementary
the
two
senses
of
the
word
correlation
must
be
carefully
distinguished
it
would
be
a
downright
paralogism
to
adopt
one
of
them
in
the
premisses
of
the
reasoning
and
the
other
in
the
conclusion
and
this
is
just
what
is
done
when
the
principle
of
correlation
is
invoked
in
explanations
of
in
order
to
account
for
complementary
variations
and
then
correlation
is
spoken
of
as
if
it
were
any
group
of
variations
provoked
by
any
variation
of
the
germ
thus
the
notion
of
correlation
is
first
used
in
current
science
as
it
might
be
used
by
an
advocate
of
finality
it
is
understood
that
this
is
only
a
convenient
way
of
expressing
oneself
that
one
will
correct
it
and
fall
back
on
pure
mechanism
when
explaining
the
nature
of
the
principles
and
turning
from
science
to
philosophy
and
one
does
then
come
back
to
pure
mechanism
but
only
by
giving
a
new
meaning
to
the
word
correlation
a
meaning
which
would
now
make
correlation
inapplicable
to
the
detail
it
is
called
upon
to
explain
to
sum
up
if
the
accidental
variations
that
bring
about
evolution
are
insensible
variations
some
good
genius
must
be
appealed
to
the
genius
of
the
future
species
in
order
to
preserve
and
accumulate
these
variations
for
selection
will
not
look
after
this
if
on
the
other
hand
the
accidental
variations
are
sudden
then
for
the
previous
function
to
go
on
or
for
a
new
function
to
take
its
place
all
the
changes
that
have
happened
together
must
be
complementary
so
we
have
to
fall
back
on
the
good
genius
again
this
time
to
obtain
the
of
changes
as
before
to
be
assured
of
the
of
of
variations
but
in
neither
case
can
parallel
development
of
the
same
complex
structures
on
independent
lines
of
evolution
be
due
to
a
mere
accumulation
of
accidental
variations
so
we
come
to
the
second
of
the
two
great
hypotheses
we
have
to
examine
suppose
the
variations
are
due
not
to
accidental
and
inner
causes
but
to
the
direct
influence
of
outer
circumstances
let
us
see
what
line
we
should
have
to
take
on
this
hypothesis
to
account
for
the
resemblance
of
in
two
series
that
are
independent
of
each
other
from
the
phylogenetic
point
of
view
though
molluscs
and
vertebrates
have
evolved
separately
both
have
remained
exposed
to
the
influence
of
light
and
light
is
a
physical
cause
bringing
forth
certain
definite
effects
acting
in
a
continuous
way
it
has
been
able
to
produce
a
continuous
variation
in
a
constant
direction
of
course
it
is
unlikely
that
the
eye
of
the
vertebrate
and
that
of
the
mollusc
have
been
built
up
by
a
series
of
variations
due
to
simple
chance
admitting
even
that
light
enters
into
the
case
as
an
instrument
of
selection
in
order
to
allow
only
useful
variations
to
persist
there
is
no
possibility
that
the
play
of
chance
even
thus
supervised
from
without
should
bring
about
in
both
cases
the
same
juxtaposition
of
elements
coördinated
in
the
same
way
but
it
would
be
different
supposing
that
light
acted
directly
on
the
organized
matter
so
as
to
change
its
structure
and
somehow
adapt
this
structure
to
its
own
form
the
resemblance
of
the
two
effects
would
then
be
explained
by
the
identity
of
the
cause
the
more
and
more
complex
eye
would
be
something
like
the
deeper
and
deeper
imprint
of
light
on
a
matter
which
being
organized
possesses
a
special
aptitude
for
receiving
it
but
can
an
organic
structure
be
likened
to
an
imprint
we
have
already
called
attention
to
the
ambiguity
of
the
term
adaptation
the
gradual
complication
of
a
form
which
is
being
better
and
better
adapted
to
the
mold
of
outward
circumstances
is
one
thing
the
increasingly
complex
structure
of
an
instrument
which
derives
more
and
more
advantage
from
these
circumstances
is
another
in
the
former
case
the
matter
merely
receives
an
imprint
in
the
second
it
reacts
positively
it
solves
a
problem
obviously
it
is
this
second
sense
of
the
word
adapt
that
is
used
when
one
says
that
the
eye
has
become
better
and
better
adapted
to
the
influence
of
light
but
one
passes
more
or
less
unconsciously
from
this
sense
to
the
other
and
a
purely
mechanistic
biology
will
strive
to
make
the
adaptation
of
an
inert
matter
which
submits
to
the
influence
of
its
environment
mean
the
same
as
the
adaptation
of
an
organism
which
derives
from
this
influence
an
advantage
it
can
appropriate
it
must
be
owned
indeed
that
nature
herself
appears
to
invite
our
mind
to
confuse
these
two
kinds
of
adaptation
for
she
usually
begins
by
a
passive
adaptation
where
later
on
she
will
build
up
a
mechanism
for
active
response
thus
in
the
case
before
us
it
is
unquestionable
that
the
first
rudiment
of
the
eye
is
found
in
the
of
the
lower
organisms
this
spot
may
indeed
have
been
produced
physically
by
the
mere
action
of
light
and
there
are
a
great
number
of
intermediaries
between
the
simple
spot
of
pigment
and
a
complicated
eye
like
that
of
the
but
from
the
fact
that
we
pass
from
one
thing
to
another
by
degrees
it
does
not
follow
that
the
two
things
are
of
the
same
nature
from
the
fact
that
an
orator
falls
in
at
first
with
the
passions
of
his
audience
in
order
to
make
himself
master
of
them
it
will
not
be
concluded
that
to
is
the
same
as
to
now
living
matter
seems
to
have
no
other
means
of
turning
circumstances
to
good
account
than
by
adapting
itself
to
them
passively
at
the
outset
where
it
has
to
direct
a
movement
it
begins
by
adopting
it
life
proceeds
by
insinuation
the
intermediate
degrees
between
a
and
an
eye
are
nothing
to
the
point
however
numerous
the
degrees
there
will
still
be
the
same
interval
between
the
and
the
eye
as
between
a
photograph
and
a
photographic
apparatus
certainly
the
photograph
has
been
gradually
turned
into
a
photographic
apparatus
but
could
light
alone
a
physical
force
ever
have
provoked
this
change
and
converted
an
impression
left
by
it
into
a
machine
capable
of
using
it
it
may
be
claimed
that
considerations
of
utility
are
out
of
place
here
that
the
eye
is
not
made
to
see
but
that
we
see
because
we
have
eyes
that
the
organ
is
what
it
is
and
utility
is
a
word
by
which
we
designate
the
functional
effects
of
the
structure
but
when
i
say
that
the
eye
makes
use
of
light
i
do
not
merely
mean
that
the
eye
is
capable
of
seeing
i
allude
to
the
very
precise
relations
that
exist
between
this
organ
and
the
apparatus
of
locomotion
the
retina
of
vertebrates
is
prolonged
in
an
optic
nerve
which
again
is
continued
by
cerebral
centres
connected
with
motor
mechanisms
our
eye
makes
use
of
light
in
that
it
enables
us
to
utilize
by
movements
of
reaction
the
objects
that
we
see
to
be
advantageous
and
to
avoid
those
which
we
see
to
be
injurious
now
of
course
as
light
may
have
produced
a
by
physical
means
so
it
can
physically
determine
the
movements
of
certain
organisms
ciliated
infusoria
for
instance
react
to
light
but
no
one
would
hold
that
the
influence
of
light
has
physically
caused
the
formation
of
a
nervous
system
of
a
muscular
system
of
an
osseous
system
all
things
which
are
continuous
with
the
apparatus
of
vision
in
vertebrate
animals
the
truth
is
when
one
speaks
of
the
gradual
formation
of
the
eye
and
still
more
when
one
takes
into
account
all
that
is
inseparably
connected
with
it
one
brings
in
something
entirely
different
from
the
direct
action
of
light
one
implicitly
attributes
to
organized
matter
a
certain
capacity
the
mysterious
power
of
building
up
very
complicated
machines
to
utilize
the
simple
excitation
that
it
undergoes
but
this
is
just
what
is
claimed
to
be
unnecessary
physics
and
chemistry
are
said
to
give
us
the
key
to
everything
eimer
great
work
is
instructive
in
this
respect
it
is
well
known
what
persevering
effort
this
biologist
has
devoted
to
demonstrating
that
transformation
is
brought
about
by
the
influence
of
the
external
on
the
internal
continuously
exerted
in
the
same
direction
and
not
as
darwin
held
by
accidental
variations
his
theory
rests
on
observations
of
the
highest
interest
of
which
the
was
the
study
of
the
course
followed
by
the
color
variation
of
the
skin
in
certain
lizards
before
this
the
already
old
experiments
of
dorfmeister
had
shown
that
the
same
chrysalis
according
as
it
was
submitted
to
cold
or
heat
gave
rise
to
very
different
butterflies
which
had
long
been
regarded
as
independent
species
and
an
intermediate
temperature
produces
an
intermediate
form
we
might
class
with
these
facts
the
important
transformations
observed
in
a
little
crustacean
when
the
salt
of
the
water
it
lives
in
is
increased
or
diminished
in
these
various
experiments
the
external
agent
seems
to
act
as
a
cause
of
transformation
but
what
does
the
word
cause
mean
here
without
undertaking
an
exhaustive
analysis
of
the
idea
of
causality
we
will
merely
remark
that
three
very
different
meanings
of
this
term
are
commonly
confused
a
cause
may
act
by
or
the
that
strikes
another
determines
its
movement
by
the
spark
that
explodes
the
powder
acts
by
the
gradual
relaxing
of
the
spring
that
makes
the
phonograph
turn
the
melody
inscribed
on
the
cylinder
if
the
melody
which
is
played
be
the
effect
and
the
relaxing
of
the
spring
the
cause
we
must
say
that
the
cause
acts
by
what
distinguishes
these
three
cases
from
each
other
is
the
greater
or
less
solidarity
between
the
cause
and
the
effect
in
the
first
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
effect
vary
with
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
cause
in
the
second
neither
quality
nor
quantity
of
the
effect
varies
with
quality
and
quantity
of
the
cause
the
effect
is
invariable
in
the
third
the
quantity
of
the
effect
depends
on
the
quantity
of
the
cause
but
the
cause
does
not
influence
the
quality
of
the
effect
the
longer
the
cylinder
turns
by
the
action
of
the
spring
the
more
of
the
melody
i
shall
hear
but
the
nature
of
the
melody
or
of
the
part
heard
does
not
depend
on
the
action
of
the
spring
only
in
the
first
case
really
does
cause
effect
in
the
others
the
effect
is
more
or
less
given
in
advance
and
the
antecedent
invoked
is
in
different
degrees
of
course
its
occasion
rather
than
its
cause
now
in
saying
that
the
saltness
of
the
water
is
the
cause
of
the
transformations
of
artemia
or
that
the
degree
of
temperature
determines
the
color
and
marks
of
the
wings
which
a
certain
chrysalis
will
assume
on
becoming
a
butterfly
is
the
word
cause
used
in
the
first
sense
obviously
not
causality
has
here
an
intermediary
sense
between
those
of
unwinding
and
releasing
such
indeed
seems
to
be
eimer
own
meaning
when
he
speaks
of
the
kaleidoscopic
character
of
the
variation
or
when
he
says
that
the
variation
of
organized
matter
works
in
a
definite
way
just
as
inorganic
matter
crystallizes
in
definite
directions
and
it
may
be
granted
perhaps
that
the
process
is
a
merely
physical
and
chemical
one
in
the
case
of
the
of
the
skin
but
if
this
sort
of
explanation
is
extended
to
the
case
of
the
gradual
formation
of
the
eye
of
the
vertebrate
for
instance
it
must
be
supposed
that
the
of
living
bodies
is
such
that
the
influence
of
light
has
caused
the
organism
to
construct
a
progressive
series
of
visual
apparatus
all
extremely
complex
yet
all
capable
of
seeing
and
of
seeing
better
and
better
what
more
could
the
most
confirmed
finalist
say
in
order
to
mark
out
so
exceptional
a
and
will
not
the
position
of
a
mechanistic
philosophy
become
still
more
difficult
when
it
is
pointed
out
to
it
that
the
egg
of
a
mollusc
can
not
have
the
same
chemical
composition
as
that
of
a
vertebrate
that
the
organic
substance
which
evolved
toward
the
first
of
these
two
forms
could
not
have
been
chemically
identical
with
that
of
the
substance
which
went
in
the
other
direction
and
that
nevertheless
under
the
influence
of
light
the
same
organ
has
been
constructed
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
the
more
we
reflect
upon
it
the
more
we
shall
see
that
this
production
of
the
same
effect
by
two
different
accumulations
of
an
enormous
number
of
small
causes
is
contrary
to
the
principles
of
mechanistic
philosophy
we
have
concentrated
the
full
force
of
our
discussion
upon
an
example
drawn
from
phylogenesis
but
ontogenesis
would
have
furnished
us
with
facts
no
less
cogent
every
moment
right
before
our
eyes
nature
arrives
at
identical
results
in
sometimes
neighboring
species
by
entirely
different
embryogenic
processes
observations
of
heteroblastia
have
multiplied
in
late
years
and
it
has
been
necessary
to
reject
the
almost
classical
theory
of
the
specificity
of
embryonic
gills
still
keeping
to
our
comparison
between
the
eye
of
vertebrates
and
that
of
molluscs
we
may
point
out
that
the
retina
of
the
vertebrate
is
produced
by
an
expansion
in
the
rudimentary
brain
of
the
young
embryo
it
is
a
regular
nervous
centre
which
has
moved
toward
the
periphery
in
the
mollusc
on
the
contrary
the
retina
is
derived
from
the
ectoderm
directly
and
not
indirectly
by
means
of
the
embryonic
encephalon
quite
different
therefore
are
the
evolutionary
processes
which
lead
in
man
and
in
the
pecten
to
the
development
of
a
like
retina
but
without
going
so
far
as
to
compare
two
organisms
so
distant
from
each
other
we
might
reach
the
same
conclusion
simply
by
looking
at
certain
very
curious
facts
of
regeneration
in
one
and
the
same
organism
if
the
crystalline
lens
of
a
triton
be
removed
it
is
regenerated
by
the
iris
now
the
original
lens
was
built
out
of
the
ectoderm
while
the
iris
is
of
mesodermic
origin
what
is
more
in
the
if
the
lens
be
removed
and
the
iris
left
the
regeneration
of
the
lens
takes
place
at
the
upper
part
of
the
iris
but
if
this
upper
part
of
the
iris
itself
be
taken
away
the
regeneration
takes
place
in
the
inner
or
retinal
layer
of
the
remaining
region
thus
parts
differently
situated
differently
constituted
meant
normally
for
different
functions
are
capable
of
performing
the
same
duties
and
even
of
manufacturing
when
necessary
the
same
pieces
of
the
machine
here
we
have
indeed
the
same
effect
obtained
by
different
combinations
of
causes
whether
we
will
or
no
we
must
appeal
to
some
inner
directing
principle
in
order
to
account
for
this
convergence
of
effects
such
convergence
does
not
appear
possible
in
the
darwinian
and
especially
the
theory
of
insensible
accidental
variations
nor
in
the
hypothesis
of
sudden
accidental
variations
nor
even
in
the
theory
that
assigns
definite
directions
to
the
evolution
of
the
various
organs
by
a
kind
of
mechanical
composition
of
the
external
with
the
internal
forces
so
we
come
to
the
only
one
of
the
present
forms
of
evolution
which
remains
for
us
to
mention
it
is
well
known
that
lamarck
attributed
to
the
living
being
the
power
of
varying
by
use
or
disuse
of
its
organs
and
also
of
passing
on
the
variation
so
acquired
to
its
descendants
a
certain
number
of
biologists
hold
a
doctrine
of
this
kind
the
variation
that
results
in
a
new
species
is
not
they
believe
merely
an
accidental
variation
inherent
in
the
germ
itself
nor
is
it
governed
by
a
determinism
which
develops
definite
characters
in
a
definite
direction
apart
from
every
consideration
of
utility
it
springs
from
the
very
effort
of
the
living
being
to
adapt
itself
to
the
circumstances
of
its
existence
the
effort
may
indeed
be
only
the
mechanical
exercise
of
certain
organs
mechanically
elicited
by
the
pressure
of
external
circumstances
but
it
may
also
imply
consciousness
and
will
and
it
is
in
this
sense
that
it
appears
to
be
understood
by
one
of
the
most
eminent
representatives
of
the
doctrine
the
american
naturalist
cope
is
therefore
of
all
the
later
forms
of
evolutionism
the
only
one
capable
of
admitting
an
internal
and
psychological
principle
of
development
although
it
is
not
bound
to
do
so
and
it
is
also
the
only
evolutionism
that
seems
to
us
to
account
for
the
building
up
of
identical
complex
organs
on
independent
lines
of
development
for
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
the
same
effort
to
turn
the
same
circumstances
to
good
account
might
have
the
same
result
especially
if
the
problem
put
by
the
circumstances
is
such
as
to
admit
of
only
one
solution
but
the
question
remains
whether
the
term
effort
must
not
then
be
taken
in
a
deeper
sense
a
sense
even
more
psychological
than
any
supposes
for
a
mere
variation
of
size
is
one
thing
and
a
change
of
form
is
another
that
an
organ
can
be
strengthened
and
grow
by
exercise
nobody
will
deny
but
it
is
a
long
way
from
that
to
the
progressive
development
of
an
eye
like
that
of
the
molluscs
and
of
the
vertebrates
if
this
development
be
ascribed
to
the
influence
of
light
long
continued
but
passively
received
we
fall
back
on
the
theory
we
have
just
criticized
if
on
the
other
hand
an
internal
activity
is
appealed
to
then
it
must
be
something
quite
different
from
what
we
usually
call
an
effort
for
never
has
an
effort
been
known
to
produce
the
slightest
complication
of
an
organ
and
yet
an
enormous
number
of
complications
all
admirably
coördinated
have
been
necessary
to
pass
from
the
of
the
infusorian
to
the
eye
of
the
vertebrate
but
even
if
we
accept
this
notion
of
the
evolutionary
process
in
the
case
of
animals
how
can
we
apply
it
to
plants
here
variations
of
form
do
not
seem
to
imply
nor
always
to
lead
to
functional
changes
and
even
if
the
cause
of
the
variation
is
of
a
psychological
nature
we
can
hardly
call
it
an
effort
unless
we
give
a
very
unusual
extension
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
the
truth
is
it
is
necessary
to
dig
beneath
the
effort
itself
and
look
for
a
deeper
cause
this
is
especially
necessary
we
believe
if
we
wish
to
get
at
a
cause
of
regular
hereditary
variations
we
are
not
going
to
enter
here
into
the
controversies
over
the
transmissibility
of
acquired
characters
still
less
do
we
wish
to
take
too
definite
a
side
on
this
question
which
is
not
within
our
province
but
we
can
not
remain
completely
indifferent
to
it
nowhere
is
it
clearer
that
philosophers
can
not
content
themselves
with
vague
generalities
but
must
follow
the
scientists
in
experimental
detail
and
discuss
the
results
with
them
if
spencer
had
begun
by
putting
to
himself
the
question
of
the
hereditability
of
acquired
characters
his
evolutionism
would
no
doubt
have
taken
an
altogether
different
form
if
as
seems
probable
to
us
a
habit
contracted
by
the
individual
were
transmitted
to
its
descendants
only
in
very
exceptional
cases
all
the
spencerian
psychology
would
need
remaking
and
a
large
part
of
spencer
philosophy
would
fall
to
pieces
let
us
say
then
how
the
problem
seems
to
us
to
present
itself
and
in
what
direction
an
attempt
might
be
made
to
solve
it
after
having
been
affirmed
as
a
dogma
the
transmissibility
of
acquired
characters
has
been
no
less
dogmatically
denied
for
reasons
drawn
from
the
supposed
nature
of
germinal
cells
it
is
well
known
how
weismann
was
led
by
his
hypothesis
of
the
continuity
of
the
to
regard
the
germinal
cells
ova
and
spermatozoa
as
almost
independent
of
the
somatic
cells
starting
from
this
it
has
been
claimed
and
is
still
claimed
by
many
that
the
hereditary
transmission
of
an
acquired
character
is
inconceivable
but
if
perchance
experiment
should
show
that
acquired
characters
are
transmissible
it
would
prove
thereby
that
the
is
not
so
independent
of
the
somatic
envelope
as
has
been
contended
and
the
transmissibility
of
acquired
characters
would
become
conceivable
which
amounts
to
saying
that
conceivability
and
inconceivability
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
and
that
experience
alone
must
settle
the
matter
but
it
is
just
here
that
the
difficulty
begins
the
acquired
characters
we
are
speaking
of
are
generally
habits
or
the
effects
of
habit
and
at
the
root
of
most
habits
there
is
a
natural
disposition
so
that
one
can
always
ask
whether
it
is
really
the
habit
acquired
by
the
soma
of
the
individual
that
is
transmitted
or
whether
it
is
not
rather
a
natural
aptitude
which
existed
prior
to
the
habit
this
aptitude
would
have
remained
inherent
in
the
which
the
individual
bears
within
him
as
it
was
in
the
individual
himself
and
consequently
in
the
germ
whence
he
sprang
thus
for
instance
there
is
no
proof
that
the
mole
has
become
blind
because
it
has
formed
the
habit
of
living
underground
it
is
perhaps
because
its
eyes
were
becoming
atrophied
that
it
condemned
itself
to
a
life
underground
if
this
is
the
case
the
tendency
to
lose
the
power
of
vision
has
been
transmitted
from
germ
to
germ
without
anything
being
acquired
or
lost
by
the
soma
of
the
mole
itself
from
the
fact
that
the
son
of
a
has
become
a
good
fencer
much
more
quickly
than
his
father
we
can
not
infer
that
the
habit
of
the
parent
has
been
transmitted
to
the
child
for
certain
natural
dispositions
in
course
of
growth
may
have
passed
from
the
plasma
engendering
the
father
to
the
plasma
engendering
the
son
may
have
grown
on
the
way
by
the
effect
of
the
primitive
impetus
and
thus
assured
to
the
son
a
greater
suppleness
than
the
father
had
without
troubling
so
to
speak
about
what
the
father
did
so
of
many
examples
drawn
from
the
progressive
domestication
of
animals
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
it
is
the
acquired
habit
that
is
transmitted
or
only
a
certain
natural
tendency
that
indeed
which
has
caused
such
and
such
a
particular
species
or
certain
of
its
representatives
to
be
specially
chosen
for
domestication
the
truth
is
when
every
doubtful
case
every
fact
open
to
more
than
one
interpretation
has
been
eliminated
there
remains
hardly
a
single
unquestionable
example
of
acquired
and
transmitted
peculiarities
beyond
the
famous
experiments
of
repeated
and
confirmed
by
other
physiologists
by
cutting
the
spinal
cord
or
the
sciatic
nerve
of
brought
about
an
epileptic
state
which
was
transmitted
to
the
descendants
lesions
of
the
same
sciatic
nerve
of
the
restiform
body
provoked
various
troubles
in
the
which
its
progeny
inherited
sometimes
in
a
quite
different
form
exophthalmia
loss
of
toes
etc
but
it
is
not
demonstrated
that
in
these
different
cases
of
hereditary
transmission
there
had
been
a
real
influence
of
the
soma
of
the
animal
on
its
weismann
at
once
objected
that
the
operations
of
might
have
introduced
certain
special
microbes
into
the
body
of
the
which
had
found
their
means
of
nutrition
in
the
nervous
tissues
and
transmitted
the
malady
by
penetrating
into
the
sexual
elements
this
objection
has
been
answered
by
himself
but
a
more
plausible
one
might
be
raised
some
experiments
of
voisin
and
peron
have
shown
that
fits
of
epilepsy
are
followed
by
the
elimination
of
a
toxic
body
which
when
injected
into
animals
is
capable
of
producing
convulsive
symptoms
perhaps
the
trophic
disorders
following
the
nerve
lesions
made
by
correspond
to
the
formation
of
precisely
this
poison
if
so
the
toxin
passed
from
the
to
its
spermatozoon
or
ovum
and
caused
in
the
development
of
the
embryo
a
general
disturbance
which
however
had
no
visible
effects
except
at
one
point
or
another
of
the
organism
when
developed
in
that
case
what
occurred
would
have
been
somewhat
the
same
as
in
the
experiments
of
charrin
delamare
and
moussu
where
in
gestation
whose
liver
or
kidney
was
injured
transmitted
the
lesion
to
their
progeny
simply
because
the
injury
to
the
mother
organ
had
given
rise
to
specific
cytotoxins
which
acted
on
the
corresponding
organ
of
the
foetus
it
is
true
that
in
these
experiments
as
in
a
former
observation
of
the
same
physiologists
it
was
the
already
formed
foetus
that
was
influenced
by
the
toxins
but
other
researches
of
charrin
have
resulted
in
showing
that
the
same
effect
may
be
produced
by
an
analogous
process
on
the
spermatozoa
and
the
ova
to
conclude
then
the
inheritance
of
an
acquired
peculiarity
in
the
experiments
of
can
be
explained
by
the
effect
of
a
toxin
on
the
germ
the
lesion
however
well
localized
it
seems
is
transmitted
by
the
same
process
as
for
instance
the
taint
of
alcoholism
but
may
it
not
be
the
same
in
the
case
of
every
acquired
peculiarity
that
has
become
hereditary
there
is
indeed
one
point
on
which
both
those
who
affirm
and
those
who
deny
the
transmissibility
of
acquired
characters
are
agreed
namely
that
certain
influences
such
as
that
of
alcohol
can
affect
at
the
same
time
both
the
living
being
and
the
it
contains
in
such
case
there
is
inheritance
of
a
defect
and
the
result
is
the
soma
of
the
parent
had
acted
on
the
although
in
reality
soma
and
plasma
have
simply
both
suffered
the
action
of
the
same
cause
now
suppose
that
the
soma
can
influence
the
as
those
believe
who
hold
that
acquired
characters
are
transmissible
is
not
the
most
natural
hypothesis
to
suppose
that
things
happen
in
this
second
case
as
in
the
first
and
that
the
direct
effect
of
the
influence
of
the
soma
is
a
alteration
of
the
if
this
is
the
case
it
is
by
exception
and
in
some
sort
by
accident
that
the
modification
of
the
descendant
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
parent
it
is
like
the
hereditability
of
the
alcoholic
taint
it
passes
from
father
to
children
but
it
may
take
a
different
form
in
each
child
and
in
none
of
them
be
like
what
it
was
in
the
father
let
the
letter
c
represent
the
change
in
the
plasm
c
being
either
positive
or
negative
that
is
to
say
showing
either
the
gain
or
loss
of
certain
substances
the
effect
will
not
be
an
exact
reproduction
of
the
cause
nor
will
the
change
in
the
provoked
by
a
certain
modification
of
a
certain
part
of
the
soma
determine
a
similar
modification
of
the
corresponding
part
of
the
new
organism
in
process
of
formation
unless
all
the
other
nascent
parts
of
this
organism
enjoy
a
kind
of
immunity
as
regards
c
the
same
part
will
then
undergo
alteration
in
the
new
organism
because
it
happens
that
the
development
of
this
part
is
alone
subject
to
the
new
influence
and
even
then
the
part
might
be
altered
in
an
entirely
different
way
from
that
in
which
the
corresponding
part
was
altered
in
the
generating
organism
we
should
propose
then
to
introduce
a
distinction
between
the
hereditability
of
and
that
of
an
individual
which
acquires
a
new
character
thereby
from
the
form
it
previously
had
which
form
the
germs
or
oftener
the
it
contains
would
have
reproduced
in
their
development
if
this
modification
does
not
involve
the
production
of
substances
capable
of
changing
the
or
does
not
so
affect
nutrition
as
to
deprive
the
of
certain
of
its
elements
it
will
have
no
effect
on
the
offspring
of
the
individual
this
is
probably
the
case
as
a
rule
if
on
the
contrary
it
has
some
effect
this
is
likely
to
be
due
to
a
chemical
change
which
it
has
induced
in
the
this
chemical
change
might
by
exception
bring
about
the
original
modification
again
in
the
organism
which
the
germ
is
about
to
develop
but
there
are
as
many
and
more
chances
that
it
will
do
something
else
in
this
latter
case
the
generated
organism
will
perhaps
deviate
from
the
normal
type
much
the
generating
organism
but
it
will
do
so
it
will
have
inherited
deviation
and
not
character
in
general
therefore
the
habits
formed
by
an
individual
have
probably
no
echo
in
its
offspring
and
when
they
have
the
modification
in
the
descendants
may
have
no
visible
likeness
to
the
original
one
such
at
least
is
the
hypothesis
which
seems
to
us
most
likely
in
any
case
in
default
of
proof
to
the
contrary
and
so
long
as
the
decisive
experiments
called
for
by
an
eminent
biologist
have
not
been
made
we
must
keep
to
the
actual
results
of
observation
now
even
if
we
take
the
most
favorable
view
of
the
theory
of
the
transmissibility
of
acquired
characters
and
assume
that
the
ostensible
acquired
character
is
not
in
most
cases
the
more
or
less
tardy
development
of
an
innate
character
facts
show
us
that
hereditary
transmission
is
the
exception
and
not
the
rule
how
then
shall
we
expect
it
to
develop
an
organ
such
as
the
eye
when
we
think
of
the
enormous
number
of
variations
all
in
the
same
direction
that
we
must
suppose
to
be
accumulated
before
the
passage
from
the
of
the
infusorian
to
the
eye
of
the
mollusc
and
of
the
vertebrate
is
possible
we
do
not
see
how
heredity
as
we
observe
it
could
ever
have
determined
this
of
differences
even
supposing
that
individual
efforts
could
have
produced
each
of
them
singly
that
is
to
say
that
is
no
more
able
than
any
other
form
of
evolutionism
to
solve
the
problem
in
thus
submitting
the
various
present
forms
of
evolutionism
to
a
common
test
in
showing
that
they
all
strike
against
the
same
insurmountable
difficulty
we
have
in
no
wise
the
intention
of
rejecting
them
altogether
on
the
contrary
each
of
them
being
supported
by
a
considerable
number
of
facts
must
be
true
in
its
way
each
of
them
must
correspond
to
a
certain
aspect
of
the
process
of
evolution
perhaps
even
it
is
necessary
that
a
theory
should
restrict
itself
exclusively
to
a
particular
point
of
view
in
order
to
remain
scientific
to
give
a
precise
direction
to
researches
into
detail
but
the
reality
of
which
each
of
these
theories
takes
a
partial
view
must
transcend
them
all
and
this
reality
is
the
special
object
of
philosophy
which
is
not
constrained
to
scientific
precision
because
it
contemplates
no
practical
application
let
us
therefore
indicate
in
a
word
or
two
the
positive
contribution
that
each
of
the
three
present
forms
of
evolutionism
seems
to
us
to
make
toward
the
solution
of
the
problem
what
each
of
them
leaves
out
and
on
what
point
this
threefold
effort
should
in
our
opinion
converge
in
order
to
obtain
a
more
comprehensive
although
thereby
of
necessity
a
less
definite
idea
of
the
evolutionary
process
the
are
probably
right
we
believe
when
they
teach
that
the
essential
causes
of
variation
are
the
differences
inherent
in
the
germ
borne
by
the
individual
and
not
the
experiences
or
behavior
of
the
individual
in
the
course
of
his
career
where
we
fail
to
follow
these
biologists
is
in
regarding
the
differences
inherent
in
the
germ
as
purely
accidental
and
individual
we
can
not
help
believing
that
these
differences
are
the
development
of
an
impulsion
which
passes
from
germ
to
germ
across
the
individuals
that
they
are
therefore
not
pure
accidents
and
that
they
might
well
appear
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
form
in
all
the
representatives
of
the
same
species
or
at
least
in
a
certain
number
of
them
already
in
fact
the
theory
of
is
modifying
darwinism
profoundly
on
this
point
it
asserts
that
at
a
given
moment
after
a
long
period
the
entire
species
is
beset
with
a
tendency
to
change
the
to
therefore
is
not
accidental
true
the
change
itself
would
be
accidental
since
the
mutation
works
according
to
de
vries
in
different
directions
in
the
different
representatives
of
the
species
but
first
we
must
see
if
the
theory
is
confirmed
by
many
other
vegetable
species
de
vries
has
verified
it
only
by
the
and
then
there
is
the
possibility
as
we
shall
explain
further
on
that
the
part
played
by
chance
is
much
greater
in
the
variation
of
plants
than
in
that
of
animals
because
in
the
vegetable
world
function
does
not
depend
so
strictly
on
form
be
that
as
it
may
the
are
inclined
to
admit
that
the
periods
of
mutation
are
determinate
the
direction
of
the
mutation
may
therefore
be
so
as
well
at
least
in
animals
and
to
the
extent
we
shall
have
to
indicate
we
thus
arrive
at
a
hypothesis
like
eimer
according
to
which
the
variations
of
different
characters
continue
from
generation
to
generation
in
definite
directions
this
hypothesis
seems
plausible
to
us
within
the
limits
in
which
eimer
himself
retains
it
of
course
the
evolution
of
the
organic
world
can
not
be
predetermined
as
a
whole
we
claim
on
the
contrary
that
the
spontaneity
of
life
is
manifested
by
a
continual
creation
of
new
forms
succeeding
others
but
this
indetermination
can
not
be
complete
it
must
leave
a
certain
part
to
determination
an
organ
like
the
eye
for
example
must
have
been
formed
by
just
a
continual
changing
in
a
definite
direction
indeed
we
do
not
see
how
otherwise
to
explain
the
likeness
of
structure
of
the
eye
in
species
that
have
not
the
same
history
where
we
differ
from
eimer
is
in
his
claim
that
combinations
of
physical
and
chemical
causes
are
enough
to
secure
the
result
we
have
tried
to
prove
on
the
contrary
by
the
example
of
the
eye
that
if
there
is
orthogenesis
here
a
psychological
cause
intervenes
certain
do
indeed
resort
to
a
cause
of
a
psychological
nature
there
to
our
thinking
is
one
of
the
most
solid
positions
of
but
if
this
cause
is
nothing
but
the
conscious
effort
of
the
individual
it
can
not
operate
in
more
than
a
restricted
number
of
cases
at
most
in
the
animal
world
and
not
at
all
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
even
in
animals
it
will
act
only
on
points
which
are
under
the
direct
or
indirect
control
of
the
will
and
even
where
it
does
act
it
is
not
clear
how
it
could
compass
a
change
so
profound
as
an
increase
of
complexity
at
most
this
would
be
conceivable
if
the
acquired
characters
were
regularly
transmitted
so
as
to
be
added
together
but
this
transmission
seems
to
be
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
a
hereditary
change
in
a
definite
direction
which
continues
to
accumulate
and
add
to
itself
so
as
to
build
up
a
more
and
more
complex
machine
must
certainly
be
related
to
some
sort
of
effort
but
to
an
effort
of
far
greater
depth
than
the
individual
effort
far
more
independent
of
circumstances
an
effort
common
to
most
representatives
of
the
same
species
inherent
in
the
germs
they
bear
rather
than
in
their
substance
alone
an
effort
thereby
assured
of
being
passed
on
to
their
descendants
so
we
come
back
by
a
somewhat
roundabout
way
to
the
idea
we
started
from
that
of
an
of
life
passing
from
one
generation
of
germs
to
the
following
generation
of
germs
through
the
developed
organisms
which
bridge
the
interval
between
the
generations
this
impetus
sustained
right
along
the
lines
of
evolution
among
which
it
gets
divided
is
the
fundamental
cause
of
variations
at
least
of
those
that
are
regularly
passed
on
that
accumulate
and
create
new
species
in
general
when
species
have
begun
to
diverge
from
a
common
stock
they
accentuate
their
divergence
as
they
progress
in
their
evolution
yet
in
certain
definite
points
they
may
evolve
identically
in
fact
they
must
do
so
if
the
hypothesis
of
a
common
impetus
be
accepted
this
is
just
what
we
shall
have
to
show
now
in
a
more
precise
way
by
the
same
example
we
have
chosen
the
formation
of
the
eye
in
molluscs
and
vertebrates
the
idea
of
an
original
impetus
moreover
will
thus
be
made
clearer
two
points
are
equally
striking
in
an
organ
like
the
eye
the
complexity
of
its
structure
and
the
simplicity
of
its
function
the
eye
is
composed
of
distinct
parts
such
as
the
sclerotic
the
cornea
the
retina
the
crystalline
lens
etc
in
each
of
these
parts
the
detail
is
infinite
the
retina
alone
comprises
three
layers
of
nervous
elements
multipolar
cells
bipolar
cells
visual
cells
each
of
which
has
its
individuality
and
is
undoubtedly
a
very
complicated
organism
so
complicated
indeed
is
the
retinal
membrane
in
its
intimate
structure
that
no
simple
description
can
give
an
adequate
idea
of
it
the
mechanism
of
the
eye
is
in
short
composed
of
an
infinity
of
mechanisms
all
of
extreme
complexity
yet
vision
is
one
simple
fact
as
soon
as
the
eye
opens
the
visual
act
is
effected
just
because
the
act
is
simple
the
slightest
negligence
on
the
part
of
nature
in
the
building
of
the
infinitely
complex
machine
would
have
made
vision
impossible
this
contrast
between
the
complexity
of
the
organ
and
the
unity
of
the
function
is
what
gives
us
pause
a
mechanistic
theory
is
one
which
means
to
show
us
the
gradual
of
the
machine
under
the
influence
of
external
circumstances
intervening
either
directly
by
action
on
the
tissues
or
indirectly
by
the
selection
of
ones
but
whatever
form
this
theory
may
take
supposing
it
avails
at
all
to
explain
the
detail
of
the
parts
it
throws
no
light
on
their
correlation
then
comes
the
doctrine
of
finality
which
says
that
the
parts
have
been
brought
together
on
a
preconceived
plan
with
a
view
to
a
certain
end
in
this
it
likens
the
labor
of
nature
to
that
of
the
workman
who
also
proceeds
by
the
assemblage
of
parts
with
a
view
to
the
realization
of
an
idea
or
the
imitation
of
a
model
mechanism
here
reproaches
finalism
with
its
anthropomorphic
character
and
rightly
but
it
fails
to
see
that
itself
proceeds
according
to
this
method
somewhat
mutilated
true
it
has
got
rid
of
the
end
pursued
or
the
ideal
model
but
it
also
holds
that
nature
has
worked
like
a
human
being
by
bringing
parts
together
while
a
mere
glance
at
the
development
of
an
embryo
shows
that
life
goes
to
work
in
a
very
different
way
does
not
proceed
by
the
association
and
addition
of
elements
but
by
dissociation
and
we
must
get
beyond
both
points
of
view
both
mechanism
and
finalism
being
at
bottom
only
standpoints
to
which
the
human
mind
has
been
led
by
considering
the
work
of
man
but
in
what
direction
can
we
go
beyond
them
we
have
said
that
in
analyzing
the
structure
of
an
organ
we
can
go
on
decomposing
for
ever
although
the
function
of
the
whole
is
a
simple
thing
this
contrast
between
the
infinite
complexity
of
the
organ
and
the
extreme
simplicity
of
the
function
is
what
should
open
our
eyes
in
general
when
the
same
object
appears
in
one
aspect
and
in
another
as
infinitely
complex
the
two
aspects
have
by
no
means
the
same
importance
or
rather
the
same
degree
of
reality
in
such
cases
the
simplicity
belongs
to
the
object
itself
and
the
infinite
complexity
to
the
views
we
take
in
turning
around
it
to
the
symbols
by
which
our
senses
or
intellect
represent
it
to
us
or
more
generally
to
elements
a
different
with
which
we
try
to
imitate
it
artificially
but
with
which
it
remains
incommensurable
being
of
a
different
nature
an
artist
of
genius
has
painted
a
figure
on
his
canvas
we
can
imitate
his
picture
with
squares
of
mosaic
and
we
shall
reproduce
the
curves
and
shades
of
the
model
so
much
the
better
as
our
squares
are
smaller
more
numerous
and
more
varied
in
tone
but
an
infinity
of
elements
infinitely
small
presenting
an
infinity
of
shades
would
be
necessary
to
obtain
the
exact
equivalent
of
the
figure
that
the
artist
has
conceived
as
a
simple
thing
which
he
has
wished
to
transport
as
a
whole
to
the
canvas
and
which
is
the
more
complete
the
more
it
strikes
us
as
the
projection
of
an
indivisible
intuition
now
suppose
our
eyes
so
made
that
they
can
not
help
seeing
in
the
work
of
the
master
a
mosaic
effect
or
suppose
our
intellect
so
made
that
it
can
not
explain
the
appearance
of
the
figure
on
the
canvas
except
as
a
work
of
mosaic
we
should
then
be
able
to
speak
simply
of
a
collection
of
little
squares
and
we
should
be
under
the
mechanistic
hypothesis
we
might
add
that
beside
the
materiality
of
the
collection
there
must
be
a
plan
on
which
the
artist
worked
and
then
we
should
be
expressing
ourselves
as
finalists
but
in
neither
case
should
we
have
got
at
the
real
process
for
there
are
no
squares
brought
together
it
is
the
picture
the
simple
act
projected
on
the
canvas
which
by
the
mere
fact
of
entering
into
our
perception
is
before
our
eyes
into
thousands
and
thousands
of
little
squares
which
present
as
a
wonderful
arrangement
so
the
eye
with
its
marvelous
complexity
of
structure
may
be
only
the
simple
act
of
vision
divided
into
a
mosaic
of
cells
whose
order
seems
marvelous
to
us
because
we
have
conceived
the
whole
as
an
assemblage
if
i
raise
my
hand
from
a
to
b
this
movement
appears
to
me
under
two
aspects
at
once
felt
from
within
it
is
a
simple
indivisible
act
perceived
from
without
it
is
the
course
of
a
certain
curve
ab
in
this
curve
i
can
distinguish
as
many
positions
as
i
please
and
the
line
itself
might
be
defined
as
a
certain
mutual
coördination
of
these
positions
but
the
positions
infinite
in
number
and
the
order
in
which
they
are
connected
have
sprung
automatically
from
the
indivisible
act
by
which
my
hand
has
gone
from
a
to
b
mechanism
here
would
consist
in
seeing
only
the
positions
finalism
would
take
their
order
into
account
but
both
mechanism
and
finalism
would
leave
on
one
side
the
movement
which
is
reality
itself
in
one
sense
the
movement
is
than
the
positions
and
than
their
order
for
it
is
sufficient
to
make
it
in
its
indivisible
simplicity
to
secure
that
the
infinity
of
the
successive
positions
as
also
their
order
be
given
at
once
with
something
else
which
is
neither
order
nor
position
but
which
is
essential
the
mobility
but
in
another
sense
the
movement
is
than
the
series
of
positions
and
their
connecting
order
for
to
arrange
points
in
a
certain
order
it
is
necessary
first
to
conceive
the
order
and
then
to
realize
it
with
points
there
must
be
the
work
of
assemblage
and
there
must
be
intelligence
whereas
the
simple
movement
of
the
hand
contains
nothing
of
either
it
is
not
intelligent
in
the
human
sense
of
the
word
and
it
is
not
an
assemblage
for
it
is
not
made
up
of
elements
just
so
with
the
relation
of
the
eye
to
vision
there
is
in
vision
than
the
component
cells
of
the
eye
and
their
mutual
coördination
in
this
sense
neither
mechanism
nor
finalism
go
far
enough
but
in
another
sense
mechanism
and
finalism
both
go
too
far
for
they
attribute
to
nature
the
most
formidable
of
the
labors
of
hercules
in
holding
that
she
has
exalted
to
the
simple
act
of
vision
an
infinity
of
infinitely
complex
elements
whereas
nature
has
had
no
more
trouble
in
making
an
eye
than
i
have
in
lifting
my
hand
nature
simple
act
has
divided
itself
automatically
into
an
infinity
of
elements
which
are
then
found
to
be
coördinated
to
one
idea
just
as
the
movement
of
my
hand
has
dropped
an
infinity
of
points
which
are
then
found
to
satisfy
one
equation
we
find
it
very
hard
to
see
things
in
that
light
because
we
can
not
help
conceiving
organization
as
manufacturing
but
it
is
one
thing
to
manufacture
and
quite
another
to
organize
manufacturing
is
peculiar
to
man
it
consists
in
assembling
parts
of
matter
which
we
have
cut
out
in
such
manner
that
we
can
fit
them
together
and
obtain
from
them
a
common
action
the
parts
are
arranged
so
to
speak
around
the
action
as
an
ideal
centre
to
manufacture
therefore
is
to
work
from
the
periphery
to
the
centre
or
as
the
philosophers
say
from
the
many
to
the
one
organization
on
the
contrary
works
from
the
centre
to
the
periphery
it
begins
in
a
point
that
is
almost
a
mathematical
point
and
spreads
around
this
point
by
concentric
waves
which
go
on
enlarging
the
work
of
manufacturing
is
the
more
effective
the
greater
the
quantity
of
matter
dealt
with
it
proceeds
by
concentration
and
compression
the
organizing
act
on
the
contrary
has
something
explosive
about
it
it
needs
at
the
beginning
the
smallest
possible
place
a
minimum
of
matter
as
if
the
organizing
forces
only
entered
space
reluctantly
the
spermatozoon
which
sets
in
motion
the
evolutionary
process
of
the
embryonic
life
is
one
of
the
smallest
cells
of
the
organism
and
it
is
only
a
small
part
of
the
spermatozoon
which
really
takes
part
in
the
operation
but
these
are
only
superficial
differences
digging
beneath
them
we
think
a
deeper
difference
would
be
found
a
manufactured
thing
delineates
exactly
the
form
of
the
work
of
manufacturing
it
i
mean
that
the
manufacturer
finds
in
his
product
exactly
what
he
has
put
into
it
if
he
is
going
to
make
a
machine
he
cuts
out
its
pieces
one
by
one
and
then
puts
them
together
the
machine
when
made
will
show
both
the
pieces
and
their
assemblage
the
whole
of
the
result
represents
the
whole
of
the
work
and
to
each
part
of
the
work
corresponds
a
part
of
the
result
now
i
recognize
that
positive
science
can
and
should
proceed
as
if
organization
was
like
making
a
machine
only
so
will
it
have
any
hold
on
organized
bodies
for
its
object
is
not
to
show
us
the
essence
of
things
but
to
furnish
us
with
the
best
means
of
acting
on
them
physics
and
chemistry
are
well
advanced
sciences
and
living
matter
lends
itself
to
our
action
only
so
far
as
we
can
treat
it
by
the
processes
of
our
physics
and
chemistry
organization
can
therefore
only
be
studied
scientifically
if
the
organized
body
has
first
been
likened
to
a
machine
the
cells
will
be
the
pieces
of
the
machine
the
organism
their
assemblage
and
the
elementary
labors
which
have
organized
the
parts
will
be
regarded
as
the
real
elements
of
the
labor
which
has
organized
the
whole
this
is
the
standpoint
of
science
quite
different
in
our
opinion
is
that
of
philosophy
for
us
the
whole
of
an
organized
machine
may
strictly
speaking
represent
the
whole
of
the
organizing
work
this
is
however
only
approximately
true
yet
the
parts
of
the
machine
do
not
correspond
to
parts
of
the
work
because
materiality
of
this
machine
does
not
represent
a
sum
of
means
employed
but
a
sum
of
obstacles
it
is
a
negation
rather
than
a
positive
reality
so
as
we
have
shown
in
a
former
study
vision
is
a
power
which
should
attain
an
infinity
of
things
inaccessible
to
our
eyes
but
such
a
vision
would
not
be
continued
into
action
it
might
suit
a
phantom
but
not
a
living
being
the
vision
of
a
living
being
is
an
vision
limited
to
objects
on
which
the
being
can
act
it
is
a
vision
that
is
and
the
visual
apparatus
simply
symbolizes
the
work
of
canalizing
therefore
the
creation
of
the
visual
apparatus
is
no
more
explained
by
the
assembling
of
its
anatomic
elements
than
the
digging
of
a
canal
could
be
explained
by
the
heaping
up
of
the
earth
which
might
have
formed
its
banks
a
mechanistic
theory
would
maintain
that
the
earth
had
been
brought
by
finalism
would
add
that
it
had
not
been
dumped
down
at
random
that
the
carters
had
followed
a
plan
but
both
theories
would
be
mistaken
for
the
canal
has
been
made
in
another
way
with
greater
precision
we
may
compare
the
process
by
which
nature
constructs
an
eye
to
the
simple
act
by
which
we
raise
the
hand
but
we
supposed
at
first
that
the
hand
met
with
no
resistance
let
us
now
imagine
that
instead
of
moving
in
air
the
hand
has
to
pass
through
iron
filings
which
are
compressed
and
offer
resistance
to
it
in
proportion
as
it
goes
forward
at
a
certain
moment
the
hand
will
have
exhausted
its
effort
and
at
this
very
moment
the
filings
will
be
massed
and
coördinated
in
a
certain
definite
form
to
wit
that
of
the
hand
that
is
stopped
and
of
a
part
of
the
arm
now
suppose
that
the
hand
and
arm
are
invisible
will
seek
the
reason
of
the
arrangement
in
the
filings
themselves
and
in
forces
within
the
mass
some
will
account
for
the
position
of
each
filing
by
the
action
exerted
upon
it
by
the
neighboring
filings
these
are
the
mechanists
others
will
prefer
to
think
that
a
plan
of
the
whole
has
presided
over
the
detail
of
these
elementary
actions
they
are
the
finalists
but
the
truth
is
that
there
has
been
merely
one
indivisible
act
that
of
the
hand
passing
through
the
filings
the
inexhaustible
detail
of
the
movement
of
the
grains
as
well
as
the
order
of
their
final
arrangement
expresses
negatively
in
a
way
this
undivided
movement
being
the
unitary
form
of
a
resistance
and
not
a
synthesis
of
positive
elementary
actions
for
this
reason
if
the
arrangement
of
the
grains
is
termed
an
effect
and
the
movement
of
the
hand
a
cause
it
may
indeed
be
said
that
the
whole
of
the
effect
is
explained
by
the
whole
of
the
cause
but
to
parts
of
the
cause
parts
of
the
effect
will
in
no
wise
correspond
in
other
words
neither
mechanism
nor
finalism
will
here
be
in
place
and
we
must
resort
to
an
explanation
of
a
different
kind
now
in
the
hypothesis
we
propose
the
relation
of
vision
to
the
visual
apparatus
would
be
very
nearly
that
of
the
hand
to
the
iron
filings
that
follow
canalize
and
limit
its
motion
the
greater
the
effort
of
the
hand
the
farther
it
will
go
into
the
filings
but
at
whatever
point
it
stops
instantaneously
and
automatically
the
filings
coördinate
and
find
their
equilibrium
so
with
vision
and
its
organ
according
as
the
undivided
act
constituting
vision
advances
more
or
less
the
materiality
of
the
organ
is
made
of
a
more
or
less
considerable
number
of
mutually
coördinated
elements
but
the
order
is
necessarily
complete
and
perfect
it
could
not
be
partial
because
once
again
the
real
process
which
gives
rise
to
it
has
no
parts
that
is
what
neither
mechanism
nor
finalism
takes
into
account
and
it
is
what
we
also
fail
to
consider
when
we
wonder
at
the
marvelous
structure
of
an
instrument
such
as
the
eye
at
the
bottom
of
our
wondering
is
always
this
idea
that
it
would
have
been
possible
for
part
of
this
coördination
to
have
been
realized
that
the
complete
realization
is
a
kind
of
special
favor
this
favor
the
finalists
consider
as
dispensed
to
them
all
at
once
by
the
final
cause
the
mechanists
claim
to
obtain
it
little
by
little
by
the
effect
of
natural
selection
but
both
see
something
positive
in
this
coördination
and
consequently
something
fractionable
in
its
cause
something
which
admits
of
every
possible
degree
of
achievement
in
reality
the
cause
though
more
or
less
intense
can
not
produce
its
effect
except
in
one
piece
and
completely
finished
according
as
it
goes
further
and
further
in
the
direction
of
vision
it
gives
the
simple
pigmentary
masses
of
a
lower
organism
or
the
rudimentary
eye
of
a
serpula
or
the
slightly
differentiated
eye
of
the
alciope
or
the
marvelously
perfected
eye
of
the
bird
but
all
these
organs
unequal
as
is
their
complexity
necessarily
present
an
equal
coördination
for
this
reason
no
matter
how
distant
two
animal
species
may
be
from
each
other
if
the
progress
toward
vision
has
gone
equally
far
in
both
there
is
the
same
visual
organ
in
each
case
for
the
form
of
the
organ
only
expresses
the
degree
in
which
the
exercise
of
the
function
has
been
obtained
but
in
speaking
of
a
progress
toward
vision
are
we
not
coming
back
to
the
old
notion
of
finality
it
would
be
so
undoubtedly
if
this
progress
required
the
conscious
or
unconscious
idea
of
an
end
to
be
attained
but
it
is
really
effected
in
virtue
of
the
original
impetus
of
life
it
is
implied
in
this
movement
itself
and
that
is
just
why
it
is
found
in
independent
lines
of
evolution
if
now
we
are
asked
why
and
how
it
is
implied
therein
we
reply
that
life
is
more
than
anything
else
a
tendency
to
act
on
inert
matter
the
direction
of
this
action
is
not
predetermined
hence
the
unforeseeable
variety
of
forms
which
life
in
evolving
sows
along
its
path
but
this
action
always
presents
to
some
extent
the
character
of
contingency
it
implies
at
least
a
rudiment
of
choice
now
a
choice
involves
the
anticipatory
idea
of
several
possible
actions
possibilities
of
action
must
therefore
be
marked
out
for
the
living
being
before
the
action
itself
visual
perception
is
nothing
else
the
visible
outlines
of
bodies
are
the
design
of
our
eventual
action
on
them
vision
will
be
found
therefore
in
different
degrees
in
the
most
diverse
animals
and
it
will
appear
in
the
same
complexity
of
structure
wherever
it
has
reached
the
same
degree
of
intensity
we
have
dwelt
on
these
resemblances
of
structure
in
general
and
on
the
example
of
the
eye
in
particular
because
we
had
to
define
our
attitude
toward
mechanism
on
the
one
hand
and
finalism
on
the
other
it
remains
for
us
to
describe
it
more
precisely
in
itself
this
we
shall
now
do
by
showing
the
divergent
results
of
evolution
not
as
presenting
analogies
but
as
themselves
mutually
complementary

the
divergent
directions
of
the
evolution
of
life
torpor
intelligence
instinct
the
evolution
movement
would
be
a
simple
one
and
we
should
soon
have
been
able
to
determine
its
direction
if
life
had
described
a
single
course
like
that
of
a
solid
ball
shot
from
a
cannon
but
it
proceeds
rather
like
a
shell
which
suddenly
bursts
into
fragments
which
fragments
being
themselves
shells
burst
in
their
turn
into
fragments
destined
to
burst
again
and
so
on
for
a
time
incommensurably
long
we
perceive
only
what
is
nearest
to
us
namely
the
scattered
movements
of
the
pulverized
explosions
from
them
we
have
to
go
back
stage
by
stage
to
the
original
movement
when
a
shell
bursts
the
particular
way
it
breaks
is
explained
both
by
the
explosive
force
of
the
powder
it
contains
and
by
the
resistance
of
the
metal
so
of
the
way
life
breaks
into
individuals
and
species
it
depends
we
think
on
two
series
of
causes
the
resistance
life
meets
from
inert
matter
and
the
explosive
force
due
to
an
unstable
balance
of
tendencies
which
life
bears
within
itself
the
resistance
of
inert
matter
was
the
obstacle
that
had
first
to
be
overcome
life
seems
to
have
succeeded
in
this
by
dint
of
humility
by
making
itself
very
small
and
very
insinuating
bending
to
physical
and
chemical
forces
consenting
even
to
go
a
part
of
the
way
with
them
like
the
switch
that
adopts
for
a
while
the
direction
of
the
rail
it
is
endeavoring
to
leave
of
phenomena
in
the
simplest
forms
of
life
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
they
are
still
physical
and
chemical
or
whether
they
are
already
vital
life
had
to
enter
thus
into
the
habits
of
inert
matter
in
order
to
draw
it
little
by
little
magnetized
as
it
were
to
another
track
the
animate
forms
that
first
appeared
were
therefore
of
extreme
simplicity
they
were
probably
tiny
masses
of
scarcely
differentiated
protoplasm
outwardly
resembling
the
amoeba
observable
but
possessed
of
the
tremendous
internal
push
that
was
to
raise
them
even
to
the
highest
forms
of
life
that
in
virtue
of
this
push
the
first
organisms
sought
to
grow
as
much
as
possible
seems
likely
but
organized
matter
has
a
limit
of
expansion
that
is
very
quickly
reached
beyond
a
certain
point
it
divides
instead
of
growing
ages
of
effort
and
prodigies
of
subtlety
were
probably
necessary
for
life
to
get
past
this
new
obstacle
it
succeeded
in
inducing
an
increasing
number
of
elements
ready
to
divide
to
remain
united
by
the
division
of
labor
it
knotted
between
them
an
indissoluble
bond
the
complex
and
organism
is
thus
made
to
function
as
would
a
continuous
living
mass
which
had
simply
grown
bigger
but
the
real
and
profound
causes
of
division
were
those
which
life
bore
within
its
bosom
for
life
is
tendency
and
the
essence
of
a
tendency
is
to
develop
in
the
form
of
a
sheaf
creating
by
its
very
growth
divergent
directions
among
which
its
impetus
is
divided
this
we
observe
in
ourselves
in
the
evolution
of
that
special
tendency
which
we
call
our
character
each
of
us
glancing
back
over
his
history
will
find
that
his
though
indivisible
united
in
itself
divers
persons
which
could
remain
blended
just
because
they
were
in
their
nascent
state
this
indecision
so
charged
with
promise
is
one
of
the
greatest
charms
of
childhood
but
these
interwoven
personalities
become
incompatible
in
course
of
growth
and
as
each
of
us
can
live
but
one
life
a
choice
must
perforce
be
made
we
choose
in
reality
without
ceasing
without
ceasing
also
we
abandon
many
things
the
route
we
pursue
in
time
is
strewn
with
the
remains
of
all
that
we
began
to
be
of
all
that
we
might
have
become
but
nature
which
has
at
command
an
incalculable
number
of
lives
is
in
no
wise
bound
to
make
such
sacrifices
she
preserves
the
different
tendencies
that
have
bifurcated
with
their
growth
she
creates
with
them
diverging
series
of
species
that
will
evolve
separately
these
series
may
moreover
be
of
unequal
importance
the
author
who
begins
a
novel
puts
into
his
hero
many
things
which
he
is
obliged
to
discard
as
he
goes
on
perhaps
he
will
take
them
up
later
in
other
books
and
make
new
characters
with
them
who
will
seem
like
extracts
from
or
rather
like
complements
of
the
first
but
they
will
almost
always
appear
somewhat
poor
and
limited
in
comparison
with
the
original
character
so
with
regard
to
the
evolution
of
life
the
bifurcations
on
the
way
have
been
numerous
but
there
have
been
many
blind
alleys
beside
the
two
or
three
highways
and
of
these
highways
themselves
only
one
that
which
leads
through
the
vertebrates
up
to
man
has
been
wide
enough
to
allow
free
passage
to
the
full
breath
of
life
we
get
this
impression
when
we
compare
the
societies
of
bees
and
ants
for
instance
with
human
societies
the
former
are
admirably
ordered
and
united
but
stereotyped
the
latter
are
open
to
every
sort
of
progress
but
divided
and
incessantly
at
strife
with
themselves
the
ideal
would
be
a
society
always
in
progress
and
always
in
equilibrium
but
this
ideal
is
perhaps
unrealizable
the
two
characteristics
that
would
fain
complete
each
other
which
do
complete
each
other
in
their
embryonic
state
can
no
longer
abide
together
when
they
grow
stronger
if
one
could
speak
otherwise
than
metaphorically
of
an
impulse
toward
social
life
it
might
be
said
that
the
brunt
of
the
impulse
was
borne
along
the
line
of
evolution
ending
at
man
and
that
the
rest
of
it
was
collected
on
the
road
leading
to
the
hymenoptera
the
societies
of
ants
and
bees
would
thus
present
the
aspect
complementary
to
ours
but
this
would
be
only
a
manner
of
expression
there
has
been
no
particular
impulse
towards
social
life
there
is
simply
the
general
movement
of
life
which
on
divergent
lines
is
creating
forms
ever
new
if
societies
should
appear
on
two
of
these
lines
they
ought
to
show
divergence
of
paths
at
the
same
time
as
community
of
impetus
they
will
thus
develop
two
classes
of
characteristics
which
we
shall
find
vaguely
complementary
of
each
other
so
our
study
of
the
evolution
movement
will
have
to
unravel
a
certain
number
of
divergent
directions
and
to
appreciate
the
importance
of
what
has
happened
along
each
of
them
in
a
word
to
determine
the
nature
of
the
dissociated
tendencies
and
estimate
their
relative
proportion
combining
these
tendencies
then
we
shall
get
an
approximation
or
rather
an
imitation
of
the
indivisible
motor
principle
whence
their
impetus
proceeds
evolution
will
thus
prove
to
be
something
entirely
different
from
a
series
of
adaptations
to
circumstances
as
mechanism
claims
entirely
different
also
from
the
realization
of
a
plan
of
the
whole
as
maintained
by
the
doctrine
of
finality
that
adaptation
to
environment
is
the
necessary
condition
of
evolution
we
do
not
question
for
a
moment
it
is
quite
evident
that
a
species
would
disappear
should
it
fail
to
bend
to
the
conditions
of
existence
which
are
imposed
on
it
but
it
is
one
thing
to
recognize
that
outer
circumstances
are
forces
evolution
must
reckon
with
another
to
claim
that
they
are
the
directing
causes
of
evolution
this
latter
theory
is
that
of
mechanism
it
excludes
absolutely
the
hypothesis
of
an
original
impetus
i
mean
an
internal
push
that
has
carried
life
by
more
and
more
complex
forms
to
higher
and
higher
destinies
yet
this
impetus
is
evident
and
a
mere
glance
at
fossil
species
shows
us
that
life
need
not
have
evolved
at
all
or
might
have
evolved
only
in
very
restricted
limits
if
it
had
chosen
the
alternative
much
more
convenient
to
itself
of
becoming
anchylosed
in
its
primitive
forms
certain
foraminifera
have
not
varied
since
the
silurian
epoch
unmoved
witnesses
of
the
innumerable
revolutions
that
have
upheaved
our
planet
the
lingulae
are
what
they
were
at
the
remotest
times
of
the
paleozoic
era
the
truth
is
that
adaptation
explains
the
sinuosities
of
the
movement
of
evolution
but
not
its
general
directions
still
less
the
movement
itself
the
road
that
leads
to
the
town
is
obliged
to
follow
the
ups
and
downs
of
the
hills
it
to
the
accidents
of
the
ground
but
the
accidents
of
the
ground
are
not
the
cause
of
the
road
nor
have
they
given
it
its
direction
at
every
moment
they
furnish
it
with
what
is
indispensable
namely
the
soil
on
which
it
lies
but
if
we
consider
the
whole
of
the
road
instead
of
each
of
its
parts
the
accidents
of
the
ground
appear
only
as
impediments
or
causes
of
delay
for
the
road
aims
simply
at
the
town
and
would
fain
be
a
straight
line
just
so
as
regards
the
evolution
of
life
and
the
circumstances
through
which
it
passes
with
this
difference
that
evolution
does
not
mark
out
a
solitary
route
that
it
takes
directions
without
aiming
at
ends
and
that
it
remains
inventive
even
in
its
adaptations
but
if
the
evolution
of
life
is
something
other
than
a
series
of
adaptations
to
accidental
circumstances
so
also
it
is
not
the
realization
of
a
plan
a
plan
is
given
in
advance
it
is
represented
or
at
least
representable
before
its
realization
the
complete
execution
of
it
may
be
put
off
to
a
distant
future
or
even
indefinitely
but
the
idea
is
none
the
less
formulable
at
the
present
time
in
terms
actually
given
if
on
the
contrary
evolution
is
a
creation
unceasingly
renewed
it
creates
as
it
goes
on
not
only
the
forms
of
life
but
the
ideas
that
will
enable
the
intellect
to
understand
it
the
terms
which
will
serve
to
express
it
that
is
to
say
that
its
future
overflows
its
present
and
can
not
be
sketched
out
therein
in
an
idea
there
is
the
first
error
of
finalism
it
involves
another
yet
more
serious
if
life
realizes
a
plan
it
ought
to
manifest
a
greater
harmony
the
further
it
advances
just
as
the
house
shows
better
and
better
the
idea
of
the
architect
as
stone
is
set
upon
stone
if
on
the
contrary
the
unity
of
life
is
to
be
found
solely
in
the
impetus
that
pushes
it
along
the
road
of
time
the
harmony
is
not
in
front
but
behind
the
unity
is
derived
from
a
a
it
is
given
at
the
start
as
an
impulsion
not
placed
at
the
end
as
an
attraction
in
communicating
itself
the
impetus
splits
up
more
and
more
life
in
proportion
to
its
progress
is
scattered
in
manifestations
which
undoubtedly
owe
to
their
common
origin
the
fact
that
they
are
complementary
to
each
other
in
certain
aspects
but
which
are
none
the
less
mutually
incompatible
and
antagonistic
so
the
discord
between
species
will
go
on
increasing
indeed
we
have
as
yet
only
indicated
the
essential
cause
of
it
we
have
supposed
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
that
each
species
received
the
impulsion
in
order
to
pass
it
on
to
others
and
that
in
every
direction
in
which
life
evolves
the
propagation
is
in
a
straight
line
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
species
which
are
arrested
there
are
some
that
retrogress
evolution
is
not
only
a
movement
forward
in
many
cases
we
observe
a
and
still
more
often
a
deviation
or
turning
back
it
must
be
so
as
we
shall
show
further
on
and
the
same
causes
that
divide
the
evolution
movement
often
cause
life
to
be
diverted
from
itself
hypnotized
by
the
form
it
has
just
brought
forth
thence
results
an
increasing
disorder
no
doubt
there
is
progress
if
progress
mean
a
continual
advance
in
the
general
direction
determined
by
a
first
impulsion
but
this
progress
is
accomplished
only
on
the
two
or
three
great
lines
of
evolution
on
which
forms
ever
more
and
more
complex
ever
more
and
more
high
appear
between
these
lines
run
a
crowd
of
minor
paths
in
which
on
the
contrary
deviations
arrests
and
are
multiplied
the
philosopher
who
begins
by
laying
down
as
a
principle
that
each
detail
is
connected
with
some
general
plan
of
the
whole
goes
from
one
disappointment
to
another
as
soon
as
he
comes
to
examine
the
facts
and
as
he
had
put
everything
in
the
same
rank
he
finds
that
as
the
result
of
not
allowing
for
accident
he
must
regard
everything
as
accidental
for
accident
then
an
allowance
must
first
be
made
and
a
very
liberal
allowance
we
must
recognize
that
all
is
not
coherent
in
nature
by
so
doing
we
shall
be
led
to
ascertain
the
centres
around
which
the
incoherence
crystallizes
this
crystallization
itself
will
clarify
the
rest
the
main
directions
will
appear
in
which
life
is
moving
whilst
developing
the
original
impulse
true
we
shall
not
witness
the
detailed
accomplishment
of
a
plan
nature
is
more
and
better
than
a
plan
in
course
of
realization
a
plan
is
a
term
assigned
to
a
labor
it
closes
the
future
whose
form
it
indicates
before
the
evolution
of
life
on
the
contrary
the
portals
of
the
future
remain
wide
open
it
is
a
creation
that
goes
on
for
ever
in
virtue
of
an
initial
movement
this
movement
constitutes
the
unity
of
the
organized
world
a
prolific
unity
of
an
infinite
richness
superior
to
any
that
the
intellect
could
dream
of
for
the
intellect
is
only
one
of
its
aspects
or
products
but
it
is
easier
to
define
the
method
than
to
apply
it
the
complete
interpretation
of
the
evolution
movement
in
the
past
as
we
conceive
it
would
be
possible
only
if
the
history
of
the
development
of
the
organized
world
were
entirely
known
such
is
far
from
being
the
case
the
genealogies
proposed
for
the
different
species
are
generally
questionable
they
vary
with
their
authors
with
the
theoretic
views
inspiring
them
and
raise
discussions
to
which
the
present
state
of
science
does
not
admit
of
a
final
settlement
but
a
comparison
of
the
different
solutions
shows
that
the
controversy
bears
less
on
the
main
lines
of
the
movement
than
on
matters
of
detail
and
so
by
following
the
main
lines
as
closely
as
possible
we
shall
be
sure
of
not
going
astray
moreover
they
alone
are
important
to
us
for
we
do
not
aim
like
the
naturalist
at
finding
the
order
of
succession
of
different
species
but
only
at
defining
the
principal
directions
of
their
evolution
and
not
all
of
these
directions
have
the
same
interest
for
us
what
concerns
us
particularly
is
the
path
that
leads
to
man
we
shall
therefore
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
in
following
one
direction
and
another
that
our
main
business
is
to
determine
the
relation
of
man
to
the
animal
kingdom
and
the
place
of
the
animal
kingdom
itself
in
the
organized
world
as
a
whole
to
begin
with
the
second
point
let
us
say
that
no
definite
characteristic
distinguishes
the
plant
from
the
animal
attempts
to
define
the
two
kingdoms
strictly
have
always
come
to
naught
there
is
not
a
single
property
of
vegetable
life
that
is
not
found
in
some
degree
in
certain
animals
not
a
single
characteristic
feature
of
the
animal
that
has
not
been
seen
in
certain
species
or
at
certain
moments
in
the
vegetable
world
naturally
therefore
biologists
enamored
of
concepts
have
regarded
the
distinction
between
the
two
kingdoms
as
artificial
they
would
be
right
if
definition
in
this
case
must
be
made
as
in
the
mathematical
and
physical
sciences
according
to
certain
statical
attributes
which
belong
to
the
object
defined
and
are
not
found
in
any
other
very
different
in
our
opinion
is
the
kind
of
definition
which
befits
the
sciences
of
life
there
is
no
manifestation
of
life
which
does
not
contain
in
a
rudimentary
state
either
latent
or
potential
the
essential
characters
of
most
other
manifestations
the
difference
is
in
the
proportions
but
this
very
difference
of
proportion
will
suffice
to
define
the
group
if
we
can
establish
that
it
is
not
accidental
and
that
the
group
as
it
evolves
tends
more
and
more
to
emphasize
these
particular
characters
in
a
word
group
must
not
be
defined
by
the
possession
of
certain
characters
but
by
its
tendency
to
emphasize
from
this
point
of
view
taking
tendencies
rather
than
states
into
account
we
find
that
vegetables
and
animals
may
be
precisely
defined
and
distinguished
and
that
they
correspond
to
two
divergent
developments
of
life
this
divergence
is
shown
first
in
the
method
of
alimentation
we
know
that
the
vegetable
derives
directly
from
the
air
and
water
and
soil
the
elements
necessary
to
maintain
life
especially
carbon
and
nitrogen
which
it
takes
in
mineral
form
the
animal
on
the
contrary
can
not
assimilate
these
elements
unless
they
have
already
been
fixed
for
it
in
organic
substances
by
plants
or
by
animals
which
directly
or
indirectly
owe
them
to
plants
so
that
ultimately
the
vegetable
nourishes
the
animal
true
this
law
allows
of
many
exceptions
among
vegetables
we
do
not
hesitate
to
class
amongst
vegetables
the
drosera
the
dionaea
the
pinguicula
which
are
insectivorous
plants
on
the
other
hand
the
fungi
which
occupy
so
considerable
a
place
in
the
vegetable
world
feed
like
animals
whether
they
are
ferments
saprophytes
or
parasites
it
is
to
already
formed
organic
substances
that
they
owe
their
nourishment
it
is
therefore
impossible
to
draw
from
this
difference
any
definition
such
as
would
automatically
settle
in
any
particular
case
the
question
whether
we
are
dealing
with
a
plant
or
an
animal
but
the
difference
may
provide
the
beginning
of
a
definition
of
the
two
kingdoms
in
that
it
marks
the
two
divergent
directions
in
which
vegetables
and
animals
have
taken
their
course
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
the
fungi
which
nature
has
spread
all
over
the
earth
in
such
extraordinary
profusion
have
not
been
able
to
evolve
organically
they
do
not
rise
above
tissues
which
in
the
higher
vegetables
are
formed
in
the
embryonic
sac
of
the
ovary
and
precede
the
germinative
development
of
the
new
individual
they
might
be
called
the
abortive
children
of
the
vegetable
world
their
different
species
are
like
so
many
blind
alleys
as
if
by
renouncing
the
mode
of
alimentation
customary
amongst
vegetables
they
had
been
brought
to
a
standstill
on
the
highway
of
vegetable
evolution
as
to
the
drosera
the
dionaea
and
insectivorous
plants
in
general
they
are
fed
by
their
roots
like
other
plants
they
too
fix
by
their
green
parts
the
carbon
of
the
carbonic
acid
in
the
atmosphere
their
faculty
of
capturing
absorbing
and
digesting
insects
must
have
arisen
late
in
quite
exceptional
cases
where
the
soil
was
too
poor
to
furnish
sufficient
nourishment
in
a
general
way
then
if
we
attach
less
importance
to
the
presence
of
special
characters
than
to
their
tendency
to
develop
and
if
we
regard
as
essential
that
tendency
along
which
evolution
has
been
able
to
continue
indefinitely
we
may
say
that
vegetables
are
distinguished
from
animals
by
their
power
of
creating
organic
matter
out
of
mineral
elements
which
they
draw
directly
from
the
air
and
earth
and
water
but
now
we
come
to
another
difference
deeper
than
this
though
not
unconnected
with
it
the
animal
being
unable
to
fix
directly
the
carbon
and
nitrogen
which
are
everywhere
to
be
found
has
to
seek
for
its
nourishment
vegetables
which
have
already
fixed
these
elements
or
animals
which
have
taken
them
from
the
vegetable
kingdom
so
the
animal
must
be
able
to
move
from
the
amoeba
which
thrusts
out
its
pseudopodia
at
random
to
seize
the
organic
matter
scattered
in
a
drop
of
water
up
to
the
higher
animals
which
have
with
which
to
recognize
their
prey
locomotor
organs
to
go
and
seize
it
and
a
nervous
system
to
coördinate
their
movements
with
their
sensations
animal
life
is
characterized
in
its
general
direction
by
mobility
in
space
in
its
most
rudimentary
form
the
animal
is
a
tiny
mass
of
protoplasm
enveloped
at
most
in
a
thin
albuminous
pellicle
which
allows
full
freedom
for
change
of
shape
and
movement
the
vegetable
cell
on
the
contrary
is
surrounded
by
a
membrane
of
cellulose
which
condemns
it
to
immobility
and
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
there
are
the
same
habits
growing
more
and
more
sedentary
the
plant
having
no
need
to
move
and
finding
around
it
in
the
air
and
water
and
soil
in
which
it
is
placed
the
mineral
elements
it
can
appropriate
directly
it
is
true
that
phenomena
of
movement
are
seen
in
plants
darwin
has
written
a
work
on
the
movements
of
climbing
plants
he
studied
also
the
contrivances
of
certain
insectivorous
plants
such
as
the
drosera
and
the
dionaea
to
seize
their
prey
the
of
the
acacia
the
sensitive
plant
are
well
known
moreover
the
circulation
of
the
vegetable
protoplasm
within
its
sheath
bears
witness
to
its
relationship
to
the
protoplasm
of
animals
whilst
in
a
large
number
of
animal
species
generally
parasites
phenomena
of
fixation
analogous
to
those
of
vegetables
can
be
observed
here
again
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
claim
that
fixity
and
mobility
are
the
two
characters
which
enable
us
to
decide
by
simple
inspection
alone
whether
we
have
before
us
a
plant
or
an
animal
but
fixity
in
the
animal
generally
seems
like
a
torpor
into
which
the
species
has
fallen
a
refusal
to
evolve
further
in
a
certain
direction
it
is
closely
akin
to
parasitism
and
is
accompanied
by
features
that
recall
those
of
vegetable
life
on
the
other
hand
the
movements
of
vegetables
have
neither
the
frequency
nor
the
variety
of
those
of
animals
generally
they
involve
only
part
of
the
organism
and
scarcely
ever
extend
to
the
whole
in
the
exceptional
cases
in
which
a
vague
spontaneity
appears
in
vegetables
it
is
as
if
we
beheld
the
accidental
awakening
of
an
activity
normally
asleep
in
short
although
both
mobility
and
fixity
exist
in
the
vegetable
as
in
the
animal
world
the
balance
is
clearly
in
favor
of
fixity
in
the
one
case
and
of
mobility
in
the
other
these
two
opposite
tendencies
are
so
plainly
directive
of
the
two
evolutions
that
the
two
kingdoms
might
almost
be
defined
by
them
but
fixity
and
mobility
again
are
only
superficial
signs
of
tendencies
that
are
still
deeper
between
mobility
and
consciousness
there
is
an
obvious
relationship
no
doubt
the
consciousness
of
the
higher
organisms
seems
bound
up
with
certain
cerebral
arrangements
the
more
the
nervous
system
develops
the
more
numerous
and
more
precise
become
the
movements
among
which
it
can
choose
the
clearer
also
is
the
consciousness
that
accompanies
them
but
neither
this
mobility
nor
this
choice
nor
consequently
this
consciousness
involves
as
a
necessary
condition
the
presence
of
a
nervous
system
the
latter
has
only
canalized
in
definite
directions
and
brought
up
to
a
higher
degree
of
intensity
a
rudimentary
and
vague
activity
diffused
throughout
the
mass
of
the
organized
substance
the
lower
we
descend
in
the
animal
series
the
more
the
nervous
centres
are
simplified
and
the
more
too
they
separate
from
each
other
till
finally
the
nervous
elements
disappear
merged
in
the
mass
of
a
less
differentiated
organism
but
it
is
the
same
with
all
the
other
apparatus
with
all
the
other
anatomical
elements
and
it
would
be
as
absurd
to
refuse
consciousness
to
an
animal
because
it
has
no
brain
as
to
declare
it
incapable
of
nourishing
itself
because
it
has
no
stomach
the
truth
is
that
the
nervous
system
arises
like
the
other
systems
from
a
division
of
labor
it
does
not
create
the
function
it
only
brings
it
to
a
higher
degree
of
intensity
and
precision
by
giving
it
the
double
form
of
reflex
and
voluntary
activity
to
accomplish
a
true
reflex
movement
a
whole
mechanism
is
necessary
set
up
in
the
spinal
cord
or
the
medulla
to
choose
voluntarily
between
several
definite
courses
of
action
cerebral
centres
are
necessary
that
is
crossways
from
which
paths
start
leading
to
motor
mechanisms
of
diverse
form
but
equal
precision
but
where
nervous
elements
are
not
yet
canalized
still
less
concentrated
into
a
system
there
is
something
from
which
by
a
kind
of
splitting
both
the
reflex
and
the
voluntary
will
arise
something
which
has
neither
the
mechanical
precision
of
the
former
nor
the
intelligent
hesitations
of
the
latter
but
which
partaking
of
both
it
may
be
infinitesimally
is
a
reaction
simply
undecided
and
therefore
vaguely
conscious
this
amounts
to
saying
that
the
humblest
organism
is
conscious
in
proportion
to
its
power
to
move
is
consciousness
here
in
relation
to
movement
the
effect
or
the
cause
in
one
sense
it
is
the
cause
since
it
has
to
direct
locomotion
but
in
another
sense
it
is
the
effect
for
it
is
the
motor
activity
that
maintains
it
and
once
this
activity
disappears
consciousness
dies
away
or
rather
falls
asleep
in
crustaceans
such
as
the
rhizocephala
which
must
formerly
have
shown
a
more
differentiated
structure
fixity
and
parasitism
accompany
the
degeneration
and
almost
complete
disappearance
of
the
nervous
system
since
in
such
a
case
the
progress
of
organization
must
have
localized
all
the
conscious
activity
in
nervous
centres
we
may
conjecture
that
consciousness
is
even
weaker
in
animals
of
this
kind
than
in
organisms
much
less
differentiated
which
have
never
had
nervous
centres
but
have
remained
mobile
how
then
could
the
plant
which
is
fixed
in
the
earth
and
finds
its
food
on
the
spot
have
developed
in
the
direction
of
conscious
activity
the
membrane
of
cellulose
in
which
the
protoplasm
wraps
itself
up
not
only
prevents
the
simplest
vegetable
organism
from
moving
but
screens
it
also
in
some
measure
from
those
outer
stimuli
which
act
on
the
sensibility
of
the
animal
as
irritants
and
prevent
it
from
going
to
sleep
the
plant
is
therefore
unconscious
here
again
however
we
must
beware
of
radical
distinctions
unconscious
and
conscious
are
not
two
labels
which
can
be
mechanically
fastened
the
one
on
every
vegetable
cell
the
other
on
all
animals
while
consciousness
sleeps
in
the
animal
which
has
degenerated
into
a
motionless
parasite
it
probably
awakens
in
the
vegetable
that
has
regained
liberty
of
movement
and
awakens
in
just
the
degree
to
which
the
vegetable
has
reconquered
this
liberty
nevertheless
consciousness
and
unconsciousness
mark
the
directions
in
which
the
two
kingdoms
have
developed
in
this
sense
that
to
find
the
best
specimens
of
consciousness
in
the
animal
we
must
to
the
highest
representatives
of
the
series
whereas
to
find
probable
cases
of
vegetable
consciousness
we
must
as
low
as
possible
in
the
scale
of
plants
down
to
the
zoospores
of
the
algae
for
instance
and
more
generally
to
those
unicellular
organisms
which
may
be
said
to
hesitate
between
the
vegetable
form
and
animality
from
this
standpoint
and
in
this
measure
we
should
define
the
animal
by
sensibility
and
awakened
consciousness
the
vegetable
by
consciousness
asleep
and
by
insensibility
to
sum
up
the
vegetable
manufactures
organic
substances
directly
with
mineral
substances
as
a
rule
this
aptitude
enables
it
to
dispense
with
movement
and
so
with
feeling
animals
which
are
obliged
to
go
in
search
of
their
food
have
evolved
in
the
direction
of
locomotor
activity
and
consequently
of
a
consciousness
more
and
more
distinct
more
and
more
ample
now
it
seems
to
us
most
probable
that
the
animal
cell
and
the
vegetable
cell
are
derived
from
a
common
stock
and
that
the
first
living
organisms
oscillated
between
the
vegetable
and
animal
form
participating
in
both
at
once
indeed
we
have
just
seen
that
the
characteristic
tendencies
of
the
evolution
of
the
two
kingdoms
although
divergent
coexist
even
now
both
in
the
plant
and
in
the
animal
the
proportion
alone
differs
ordinarily
one
of
the
two
tendencies
covers
or
crushes
down
the
other
but
in
exceptional
circumstances
the
suppressed
one
starts
up
and
regains
the
place
it
had
lost
the
mobility
and
consciousness
of
the
vegetable
cell
are
not
so
sound
asleep
that
they
can
not
rouse
themselves
when
circumstances
permit
or
demand
it
and
on
the
other
hand
the
evolution
of
the
animal
kingdom
has
always
been
retarded
or
stopped
or
dragged
back
by
the
tendency
it
has
kept
toward
the
vegetative
life
however
full
however
overflowing
the
activity
of
an
animal
species
may
appear
torpor
and
unconsciousness
are
always
lying
in
wait
for
it
it
keeps
up
its
rôle
only
by
effort
at
the
price
of
fatigue
along
the
route
on
which
the
animal
has
evolved
there
have
been
numberless
shortcomings
and
cases
of
decay
generally
associated
with
parasitic
habits
they
are
so
many
shuntings
on
to
the
vegetative
life
thus
everything
bears
out
the
belief
that
vegetable
and
animal
are
descended
from
a
common
ancestor
which
united
the
tendencies
of
both
in
a
rudimentary
state
but
the
two
tendencies
mutually
implied
in
this
rudimentary
form
became
dissociated
as
they
grew
hence
the
world
of
plants
with
its
fixity
and
insensibility
hence
the
animals
with
their
mobility
and
consciousness
there
is
no
need
in
order
to
explain
this
dividing
into
two
to
bring
in
any
mysterious
force
it
is
enough
to
point
out
that
the
living
being
leans
naturally
toward
what
is
most
convenient
to
it
and
that
vegetables
and
animals
have
chosen
two
different
kinds
of
convenience
in
the
way
of
procuring
the
carbon
and
nitrogen
they
need
vegetables
continually
and
mechanically
draw
these
elements
from
an
environment
that
continually
provides
it
animals
by
action
that
is
discontinuous
concentrated
in
certain
moments
and
conscious
go
to
find
these
bodies
in
organisms
that
have
already
fixed
them
they
are
two
different
ways
of
being
industrious
or
perhaps
we
may
prefer
to
say
of
being
idle
for
this
very
reason
we
doubt
whether
nervous
elements
however
rudimentary
will
ever
be
found
in
the
plant
what
corresponds
in
it
to
the
directing
will
of
the
animal
is
we
believe
the
direction
in
which
it
bends
the
energy
of
the
solar
radiation
when
it
uses
it
to
break
the
connection
of
the
carbon
with
the
oxygen
in
carbonic
acid
what
corresponds
in
it
to
the
sensibility
of
the
animal
is
the
impressionability
quite
of
its
kind
of
its
chlorophyl
light
now
a
nervous
system
being
a
mechanism
which
serves
as
intermediary
between
sensations
and
volitions
the
true
nervous
system
of
the
plant
seems
to
be
the
mechanism
or
rather
chemicism
which
serves
as
intermediary
between
the
impressionability
of
its
chlorophyl
to
light
and
the
producing
of
starch
which
amounts
to
saying
that
the
plant
can
have
no
nervous
elements
and
that
same
impetus
that
has
led
the
animal
to
give
itself
nerves
and
nerve
centres
must
have
ended
in
the
plant
in
the
chlorophyllian
this
first
glance
over
the
organized
world
will
enable
us
to
ascertain
more
precisely
what
unites
the
two
kingdoms
and
also
what
separates
them
suppose
as
we
suggested
in
the
preceding
chapter
that
at
the
root
of
life
there
is
an
effort
to
engraft
on
to
the
necessity
of
physical
forces
the
largest
possible
amount
of
this
effort
can
not
result
in
the
creation
of
energy
or
if
it
does
the
quantity
created
does
not
belong
to
the
order
of
magnitude
apprehended
by
our
senses
and
instruments
of
measurement
our
experience
and
science
all
that
the
effort
can
do
then
is
to
make
the
best
of
a
energy
which
it
finds
at
its
disposal
now
it
finds
only
one
way
of
succeeding
in
this
namely
to
secure
such
an
accumulation
of
potential
energy
from
matter
that
it
can
get
at
any
moment
the
amount
of
work
it
needs
for
its
action
simply
by
pulling
a
trigger
the
effort
itself
possesses
only
that
power
of
releasing
but
the
work
of
releasing
although
always
the
same
and
always
smaller
than
any
given
quantity
will
be
the
more
effective
the
heavier
the
weight
it
makes
fall
and
the
greater
the
height
or
in
other
words
the
greater
the
sum
of
potential
energy
accumulated
and
disposable
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
principal
source
of
energy
usable
on
the
surface
of
our
planet
is
the
sun
so
the
problem
was
this
to
obtain
from
the
sun
that
it
should
partially
and
provisionally
suspend
here
and
there
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
its
continual
outpour
of
usable
energy
and
store
a
certain
quantity
of
it
in
the
form
of
unused
energy
in
appropriate
reservoirs
whence
it
could
be
drawn
at
the
desired
moment
at
the
desired
spot
in
the
desired
direction
the
substances
forming
the
food
of
animals
are
just
such
reservoirs
made
of
very
complex
molecules
holding
a
considerable
amount
of
chemical
energy
in
the
potential
state
they
are
like
explosives
which
only
need
a
spark
to
set
free
the
energy
stored
within
them
now
it
is
probable
that
life
tended
at
the
beginning
to
compass
at
one
and
the
same
time
both
the
manufacture
of
the
explosive
and
the
explosion
by
which
it
is
utilized
in
this
case
the
same
organism
that
had
directly
stored
the
energy
of
the
solar
radiation
would
have
expended
it
in
free
movements
in
space
and
for
that
reason
we
must
presume
that
the
first
living
beings
sought
on
the
one
hand
to
accumulate
without
ceasing
energy
borrowed
from
the
sun
and
on
the
other
hand
to
expend
it
in
a
discontinuous
and
explosive
way
in
movements
of
locomotion
even
perhaps
a
infusorian
such
as
the
euglena
may
symbolize
this
primordial
tendency
of
life
though
in
a
mean
form
incapable
of
evolving
is
the
divergent
development
of
the
two
kingdoms
related
to
what
one
may
call
the
oblivion
of
each
kingdom
as
regards
one
of
the
two
halves
of
the
programme
or
rather
which
is
more
likely
was
the
very
nature
of
the
matter
that
life
found
confronting
it
on
our
planet
opposed
to
the
possibility
of
the
two
tendencies
evolving
very
far
together
in
the
same
organism
what
is
certain
is
that
the
vegetable
has
trended
principally
in
the
first
direction
and
the
animal
in
the
second
but
if
from
the
very
first
in
making
the
explosive
nature
had
for
object
the
explosion
then
it
is
the
evolution
of
the
animal
rather
than
that
of
the
vegetable
that
indicates
on
the
whole
the
fundamental
direction
of
life
the
harmony
of
the
two
kingdoms
the
complementary
characters
they
display
might
then
be
due
to
the
fact
that
they
develop
two
tendencies
which
at
first
were
fused
in
one
the
more
the
single
original
tendency
grows
the
harder
it
finds
it
to
keep
united
in
the
same
living
being
those
two
elements
which
in
the
rudimentary
state
implied
each
other
hence
a
parting
in
two
hence
two
divergent
evolutions
hence
also
two
series
of
characters
opposed
in
certain
points
complementary
in
others
but
whether
opposed
or
complementary
always
preserving
an
appearance
of
kinship
while
the
animal
evolved
not
without
accidents
along
the
way
toward
a
freer
and
freer
expenditure
of
discontinuous
energy
the
plant
perfected
rather
its
system
of
accumulation
without
moving
we
shall
not
dwell
on
this
second
point
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
plant
must
have
been
greatly
benefited
in
its
turn
by
a
new
division
analogous
to
that
between
plants
and
animals
while
the
primitive
vegetable
cell
had
to
fix
by
itself
both
its
carbon
and
its
nitrogen
it
became
able
almost
to
give
up
the
second
of
these
two
functions
as
soon
as
microscopic
vegetables
came
forward
which
leaned
in
this
direction
exclusively
and
even
specialized
diversely
in
this
still
complicated
business
the
microbes
that
fix
the
nitrogen
of
the
air
and
those
which
convert
the
ammoniacal
compounds
into
nitrous
ones
and
these
again
into
nitrates
have
by
the
same
splitting
up
of
a
tendency
primitively
one
rendered
to
the
whole
vegetable
world
the
same
kind
of
service
as
the
vegetables
in
general
have
rendered
to
animals
if
a
special
kingdom
were
to
be
made
for
these
microscopic
vegetables
it
might
be
said
that
in
the
microbes
of
the
soil
the
vegetables
and
the
animals
we
have
before
us
the
carried
out
by
the
matter
that
life
found
at
its
disposal
on
our
planet
of
all
that
life
contained
at
the
outset
in
a
state
of
reciprocal
implication
is
this
properly
speaking
a
division
of
labor
these
words
do
not
give
the
exact
idea
of
evolution
such
as
we
conceive
it
wherever
there
is
division
of
labor
there
is
and
also
of
effort
now
the
evolution
we
are
speaking
of
is
never
achieved
by
means
of
association
but
by
it
never
tends
toward
convergence
but
toward
of
efforts
the
harmony
between
terms
that
are
mutually
complementary
in
certain
points
is
not
in
our
opinion
produced
in
course
of
progress
by
a
reciprocal
adaptation
on
the
contrary
it
is
complete
only
at
the
start
it
arises
from
an
original
identity
from
the
fact
that
the
evolutionary
process
splaying
out
like
a
sheaf
sunders
in
proportion
to
their
simultaneous
growth
terms
which
at
first
completed
each
other
so
well
that
they
coalesced
now
the
elements
into
which
a
tendency
splits
up
are
far
from
possessing
the
same
importance
or
above
all
the
same
power
to
evolve
we
have
just
distinguished
three
different
kingdoms
if
one
may
so
express
it
in
the
organized
world
while
the
first
comprises
only
microorganisms
which
have
remained
in
the
rudimentary
state
animals
and
vegetables
have
taken
their
flight
toward
very
lofty
fortunes
such
indeed
is
generally
the
case
when
a
tendency
divides
among
the
divergent
developments
to
which
it
gives
rise
some
go
on
indefinitely
others
come
more
or
less
quickly
to
the
end
of
their
tether
these
latter
do
not
issue
directly
from
the
primitive
tendency
but
from
one
of
the
elements
into
which
it
has
divided
they
are
residual
developments
made
and
left
behind
on
the
way
by
some
truly
elementary
tendency
which
continues
to
evolve
now
these
truly
elementary
tendencies
we
think
bear
a
mark
by
which
they
may
be
recognized
this
mark
is
like
a
trace
still
visible
in
each
of
what
was
in
the
original
tendency
of
which
they
represent
the
elementary
directions
the
elements
of
a
tendency
are
not
like
objects
set
beside
each
other
in
space
and
mutually
exclusive
but
rather
like
psychic
states
each
of
which
although
it
be
itself
to
begin
with
yet
partakes
of
others
and
so
virtually
includes
in
itself
the
whole
personality
to
which
it
belongs
there
is
no
real
manifestation
of
life
we
said
that
does
not
show
us
in
a
rudimentary
or
latent
state
the
characters
of
other
manifestations
conversely
when
we
meet
on
one
line
of
evolution
a
recollection
so
to
speak
of
what
is
developed
along
other
lines
we
must
conclude
that
we
have
before
us
dissociated
elements
of
one
and
the
same
original
tendency
in
this
sense
vegetables
and
animals
represent
the
two
great
divergent
developments
of
life
though
the
plant
is
distinguished
from
the
animal
by
fixity
and
insensibility
movement
and
consciousness
sleep
in
it
as
recollections
which
may
waken
but
beside
these
normally
sleeping
recollections
there
are
others
awake
and
active
just
those
namely
whose
activity
does
not
obstruct
the
development
of
the
elementary
tendency
itself
we
may
then
formulate
this
law
a
tendency
splits
up
in
the
course
of
its
development
each
of
the
special
tendencies
which
thus
arise
tries
to
preserve
and
develop
everything
in
the
primitive
tendency
that
is
not
incompatible
with
the
work
for
which
it
is
this
explains
precisely
the
fact
we
dwelt
on
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
formation
of
identical
complex
mechanisms
on
independent
lines
of
evolution
certain
analogies
between
the
animal
and
the
vegetable
have
probably
no
other
cause
sexual
generation
is
perhaps
only
a
luxury
for
the
plant
but
to
the
animal
it
was
a
necessity
and
the
plant
must
have
been
driven
to
it
by
the
same
impetus
which
impelled
the
animal
thereto
a
primitive
original
impetus
anterior
to
the
separation
of
the
two
kingdoms
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
tendency
of
the
vegetable
towards
a
growing
complexity
this
tendency
is
essential
to
the
animal
kingdom
ever
tormented
by
the
need
of
more
and
more
extended
and
effective
action
but
the
vegetable
condemned
to
fixity
and
insensibility
exhibits
the
same
tendency
only
because
it
received
at
the
outset
the
same
impulsion
recent
experiments
show
that
it
varies
at
random
when
the
period
of
mutation
arrives
whereas
the
animal
must
have
evolved
we
believe
in
much
more
definite
directions
but
we
will
not
dwell
further
on
this
original
doubling
of
the
modes
of
life
let
us
come
to
the
evolution
of
animals
in
which
we
are
more
particularly
interested
what
constitutes
animality
we
said
is
the
faculty
of
utilizing
a
releasing
mechanism
for
the
conversion
of
as
much
potential
energy
as
possible
into
explosive
actions
in
the
beginning
the
explosion
is
haphazard
and
does
not
choose
its
direction
thus
the
amoeba
thrusts
out
its
pseudopodic
prolongations
in
all
directions
at
once
but
as
we
rise
in
the
animal
scale
the
form
of
the
body
itself
is
observed
to
indicate
a
certain
number
of
very
definite
directions
along
which
the
energy
travels
these
directions
are
marked
by
so
many
chains
of
nervous
elements
now
the
nervous
element
has
gradually
emerged
from
the
barely
differentiated
mass
of
organized
tissue
it
may
therefore
be
surmised
that
in
the
nervous
element
as
soon
as
it
appears
and
also
in
its
appendages
the
faculty
of
suddenly
freeing
the
gradually
energy
is
concentrated
no
doubt
every
living
cell
expends
energy
without
ceasing
in
order
to
maintain
its
equilibrium
the
vegetable
cell
torpid
from
the
start
is
entirely
absorbed
in
this
work
of
maintenance
alone
as
if
it
took
for
end
what
must
at
first
have
been
only
a
means
but
in
the
animal
all
points
to
action
that
is
to
the
utilization
of
energy
for
movements
from
place
to
place
true
every
animal
cell
expends
a
good
deal
often
the
whole
of
the
energy
at
its
disposal
in
keeping
itself
alive
but
the
organism
as
a
whole
tries
to
attract
as
much
energy
as
possible
to
those
points
where
the
locomotive
movements
are
effected
so
that
where
a
nervous
system
exists
with
its
complementary
and
motor
apparatus
everything
should
happen
as
if
the
rest
of
the
body
had
as
its
essential
function
to
prepare
for
these
and
pass
on
to
them
at
the
moment
required
that
force
which
they
are
to
liberate
by
a
sort
of
explosion
the
part
played
by
food
amongst
the
higher
animals
is
indeed
extremely
complex
in
the
first
place
it
serves
to
repair
tissues
then
it
provides
the
animal
with
the
heat
necessary
to
render
it
as
independent
as
possible
of
changes
in
external
temperature
thus
it
preserves
supports
and
maintains
the
organism
in
which
the
nervous
system
is
set
and
on
which
the
nervous
elements
have
to
live
but
these
nervous
elements
would
have
no
reason
for
existence
if
the
organism
did
not
pass
to
them
and
especially
to
the
muscles
they
control
a
certain
energy
to
expend
and
it
may
even
be
conjectured
that
there
in
the
main
is
the
essential
and
ultimate
destination
of
food
this
does
not
mean
that
the
greater
part
of
the
food
is
used
in
this
work
a
state
may
have
to
make
enormous
expenditure
to
secure
the
return
of
taxes
and
the
sum
which
it
will
have
to
dispose
of
after
deducting
the
cost
of
collection
will
perhaps
be
very
small
that
sum
is
none
the
less
the
reason
for
the
tax
and
for
all
that
has
been
spent
to
obtain
its
return
so
it
is
with
the
energy
which
the
animal
demands
of
its
food
many
facts
seem
to
indicate
that
the
nervous
and
muscular
elements
stand
in
this
relation
towards
the
rest
of
the
organism
glance
first
at
the
distribution
of
alimentary
substances
among
the
different
elements
of
the
living
body
these
substances
fall
into
two
classes
one
the
quaternary
or
albuminoid
the
other
the
ternary
including
the
carbohydrates
and
the
fats
the
albuminoids
are
properly
plastic
destined
to
repair
the
tissues
although
owing
to
the
carbon
they
contain
they
are
capable
of
providing
energy
on
occasion
but
the
function
of
supplying
energy
has
devolved
more
particularly
on
the
second
class
of
substances
these
being
deposited
in
the
cell
rather
than
forming
part
of
its
substance
convey
to
it
in
the
form
of
chemical
potential
an
expansive
energy
that
may
be
directly
converted
into
either
movement
or
heat
in
short
the
chief
function
of
the
albuminoids
is
to
repair
the
machine
while
the
function
of
the
other
class
of
substances
is
to
supply
power
it
is
natural
that
the
albuminoids
should
have
no
specially
allotted
destination
since
every
part
of
the
machine
has
to
be
maintained
but
not
so
with
the
other
substances
the
carbohydrates
are
distributed
very
unequally
and
this
inequality
of
distribution
seems
to
us
in
the
highest
degree
instructive
conveyed
by
the
arterial
blood
in
the
form
of
glucose
these
substances
are
deposited
in
the
form
of
glycogen
in
the
different
cells
forming
the
tissues
we
know
that
one
of
the
principal
functions
of
the
liver
is
to
maintain
at
a
constant
level
the
quantity
of
glucose
held
by
the
blood
by
means
of
the
reserves
of
glycogen
secreted
by
the
hepatic
cells
now
in
this
circulation
of
glucose
and
accumulation
of
glycogen
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
effect
is
as
if
the
whole
effort
of
the
organism
were
directed
towards
providing
with
potential
energy
the
elements
of
both
the
muscular
and
the
nervous
tissues
the
organism
proceeds
differently
in
the
two
cases
but
it
arrives
at
the
same
result
in
the
first
case
it
provides
the
with
a
large
reserve
deposited
in
advance
the
quantity
of
glycogen
contained
in
the
muscles
is
indeed
enormous
in
comparison
with
what
is
found
in
the
other
tissues
in
the
nervous
tissue
on
the
contrary
the
reserve
is
small
the
nervous
elements
whose
function
is
merely
to
liberate
the
potential
energy
stored
in
the
muscle
never
have
to
furnish
much
work
at
one
time
but
the
remarkable
thing
is
that
this
reserve
is
restored
by
the
blood
at
the
very
moment
that
it
is
expended
so
that
the
nerve
is
instantly
recharged
with
potential
energy
muscular
tissue
and
nervous
tissue
are
therefore
both
privileged
the
one
in
that
it
is
stocked
with
a
large
reserve
of
energy
the
other
in
that
it
is
always
served
at
the
instant
it
is
in
need
and
to
the
exact
extent
of
its
requirements
more
particularly
it
is
from
the
system
that
the
call
for
glycogen
the
potential
energy
comes
as
if
the
rest
of
the
organism
were
simply
there
in
order
to
transmit
force
to
the
nervous
system
and
to
the
muscles
which
the
nerves
control
true
when
we
think
of
the
part
played
by
the
nervous
system
even
the
system
as
regulator
of
the
organic
life
it
may
well
be
asked
whether
in
this
exchange
of
good
offices
between
it
and
the
rest
of
the
body
the
nervous
system
is
indeed
a
master
that
the
body
serves
but
we
shall
already
incline
to
this
hypothesis
when
we
consider
even
in
the
static
state
only
the
distribution
of
potential
energy
among
the
tissues
and
we
shall
be
entirely
convinced
of
it
when
we
reflect
upon
the
conditions
in
which
the
energy
is
expended
and
restored
for
suppose
the
system
is
a
system
like
the
others
of
the
same
rank
as
the
others
borne
by
the
whole
of
the
organism
it
will
wait
until
an
excess
of
chemical
potential
is
supplied
to
it
before
it
performs
any
work
in
other
words
it
is
the
production
of
glycogen
which
will
regulate
the
consumption
by
the
nerves
and
muscles
on
the
contrary
if
the
system
is
the
actual
master
the
duration
and
extent
of
its
action
will
be
independent
to
a
certain
extent
at
least
of
the
reserve
of
glycogen
that
it
holds
and
even
of
that
contained
in
the
whole
of
the
organism
it
will
perform
work
and
the
other
tissues
will
have
to
arrange
as
they
can
to
supply
it
with
potential
energy
now
this
is
precisely
what
does
take
place
as
is
shown
in
particular
by
the
experiments
of
morat
and
dufourt
while
the
glycogenic
function
of
the
liver
depends
on
the
action
of
the
excitory
nerves
which
control
it
the
action
of
these
nerves
is
subordinated
to
the
action
of
those
which
stimulate
the
locomotor
muscles
in
this
sense
that
the
muscles
begin
by
expending
without
calculation
thus
consuming
glycogen
impoverishing
the
blood
of
its
glucose
and
finally
causing
the
liver
which
has
had
to
pour
into
the
impoverished
blood
some
of
its
reserve
of
glycogen
to
manufacture
a
fresh
supply
from
the
system
then
everything
starts
on
that
system
everything
converges
and
we
may
say
without
metaphor
that
the
rest
of
the
organism
is
at
its
service
consider
again
what
happens
in
a
prolonged
fast
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
in
animals
that
have
died
of
hunger
the
brain
is
found
to
be
almost
unimpaired
while
the
other
organs
have
lost
more
or
less
of
their
weight
and
their
cells
have
undergone
profound
changes
it
seems
as
though
the
rest
of
the
body
had
sustained
the
nervous
system
to
the
last
extremity
treating
itself
simply
as
the
means
of
which
the
nervous
system
is
the
end
to
sum
up
if
we
agree
in
short
to
understand
by
the
system
the
nervous
system
together
with
the
sensorial
apparatus
in
which
it
is
prolonged
and
the
locomotor
muscles
it
controls
we
may
say
that
a
higher
organism
is
essentially
a
system
installed
on
systems
of
digestion
respiration
circulation
secretion
whose
function
it
is
to
repair
cleanse
and
protect
it
to
create
an
unvarying
internal
environment
for
it
and
above
all
to
pass
it
potential
energy
to
convert
into
locomotive
movement
it
is
true
that
the
more
the
nervous
function
is
perfected
the
more
must
the
functions
required
to
maintain
it
develop
and
the
more
exacting
consequently
they
become
for
themselves
as
the
nervous
activity
has
emerged
from
the
protoplasmic
mass
in
which
it
was
almost
drowned
it
has
had
to
summon
around
itself
activities
of
all
kinds
for
its
support
these
could
only
be
developed
on
other
activities
which
again
implied
others
and
so
on
indefinitely
thus
it
is
that
the
complexity
of
functioning
of
the
higher
organisms
goes
on
to
infinity
the
study
of
one
of
these
organisms
therefore
takes
us
round
in
a
circle
as
if
everything
was
a
means
to
everything
else
but
the
circle
has
a
centre
none
the
less
and
that
is
the
system
of
nervous
elements
stretching
between
the
sensory
organs
and
the
motor
apparatus
we
will
not
dwell
here
on
a
point
we
have
treated
at
length
in
a
former
work
let
us
merely
recall
that
the
progress
of
the
nervous
system
has
been
effected
both
in
the
direction
of
a
more
precise
adaptation
of
movements
and
in
that
of
a
greater
latitude
left
to
the
living
being
to
choose
between
them
these
two
tendencies
may
appear
antagonistic
and
indeed
they
are
so
but
a
nervous
chain
even
in
its
most
rudimentary
form
successfully
reconciles
them
on
the
one
hand
it
marks
a
track
between
one
point
of
the
periphery
and
another
the
one
sensory
the
other
motor
it
has
therefore
canalized
an
activity
which
was
originally
diffused
in
the
protoplasmic
mass
but
on
the
other
hand
the
elements
that
compose
it
are
probably
discontinuous
at
any
rate
even
supposing
they
anastomose
they
exhibit
a
discontinuity
for
each
of
them
ends
in
a
kind
of
where
probably
the
nervous
current
may
choose
its
course
from
the
humblest
monera
to
the
best
endowed
insects
and
up
to
the
most
intelligent
vertebrates
the
progress
realized
has
been
above
all
a
progress
of
the
nervous
system
coupled
at
every
stage
with
all
the
new
constructions
and
complications
of
mechanism
that
this
progress
required
as
we
foreshadowed
in
the
beginning
of
this
work
the
rôle
of
life
is
to
insert
some
into
matter
indeterminate
unforeseeable
are
the
forms
it
creates
in
the
course
of
its
evolution
more
and
more
indeterminate
also
more
and
more
free
is
the
activity
to
which
these
forms
serve
as
the
vehicle
a
nervous
system
with
neurones
placed
end
to
end
in
such
wise
that
at
the
extremity
of
each
manifold
ways
open
in
which
manifold
questions
present
themselves
is
a
veritable
of
that
the
main
energy
of
the
vital
impulse
has
been
spent
in
creating
apparatus
of
this
kind
is
we
believe
what
a
glance
over
the
organized
world
as
a
whole
easily
shows
but
concerning
the
vital
impulse
itself
a
few
explanations
are
necessary
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
force
which
is
evolving
throughout
the
organized
world
is
a
limited
force
which
is
always
seeking
to
transcend
itself
and
always
remains
inadequate
to
the
work
it
would
fain
produce
the
errors
and
puerilities
of
radical
finalism
are
due
to
the
misapprehension
of
this
point
it
has
represented
the
whole
of
the
living
world
as
a
construction
and
a
construction
analogous
to
a
human
work
all
the
pieces
have
been
arranged
with
a
view
to
the
best
possible
functioning
of
the
machine
each
species
has
its
reason
for
existence
its
part
to
play
its
allotted
place
and
all
join
together
as
it
were
in
a
musical
concert
wherein
the
seeming
discords
are
really
meant
to
bring
out
a
fundamental
harmony
in
short
all
goes
on
in
nature
as
in
the
works
of
human
genius
where
though
the
result
may
be
trifling
there
is
at
least
perfect
adequacy
between
the
object
made
and
the
work
of
making
it
nothing
of
the
kind
in
the
evolution
of
life
there
the
disproportion
is
striking
between
the
work
and
the
result
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
of
the
organized
world
we
do
indeed
find
one
great
effort
but
most
often
this
effort
turns
short
sometimes
paralyzed
by
contrary
forces
sometimes
diverted
from
what
it
should
do
by
what
it
does
absorbed
by
the
form
it
is
engaged
in
taking
hypnotized
by
it
as
by
a
mirror
even
in
its
most
perfect
works
though
it
seems
to
have
triumphed
over
external
resistances
and
also
over
its
own
it
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
materiality
which
it
has
had
to
assume
it
is
what
each
of
us
may
experience
in
himself
our
freedom
in
the
very
movements
by
which
it
is
affirmed
creates
the
growing
habits
that
will
stifle
it
if
it
fails
to
renew
itself
by
a
constant
effort
it
is
dogged
by
automatism
the
most
living
thought
becomes
frigid
in
the
formula
that
expresses
it
the
word
turns
against
the
idea
the
letter
kills
the
spirit
and
our
most
ardent
enthusiasm
as
soon
as
it
is
externalized
into
action
is
so
naturally
congealed
into
the
cold
calculation
of
interest
or
vanity
the
one
takes
so
easily
the
shape
of
the
other
that
we
might
confuse
them
together
doubt
our
own
sincerity
deny
goodness
and
love
if
we
did
not
know
that
the
dead
retain
for
a
time
the
features
of
the
living
the
profound
cause
of
this
discordance
lies
in
an
irremediable
difference
of
rhythm
life
in
general
is
mobility
itself
particular
manifestations
of
life
accept
this
mobility
reluctantly
and
constantly
lag
behind
it
is
always
going
ahead
they
want
to
mark
time
evolution
in
general
would
fain
go
on
in
a
straight
line
each
special
evolution
is
a
kind
of
circle
like
eddies
of
dust
raised
by
the
wind
as
it
passes
the
living
turn
upon
themselves
borne
up
by
the
great
blast
of
life
they
are
therefore
relatively
stable
and
counterfeit
immobility
so
well
that
we
treat
each
of
them
as
a
rather
than
as
a
forgetting
that
the
very
permanence
of
their
form
is
only
the
outline
of
a
movement
at
times
however
in
a
fleeting
vision
the
invisible
breath
that
bears
them
is
materialized
before
our
eyes
we
have
this
sudden
illumination
before
certain
forms
of
maternal
love
so
striking
and
in
most
animals
so
touching
observable
even
in
the
solicitude
of
the
plant
for
its
seed
this
love
in
which
some
have
seen
the
great
mystery
of
life
may
possibly
deliver
us
life
secret
it
shows
us
each
generation
leaning
over
the
generation
that
shall
follow
it
allows
us
a
glimpse
of
the
fact
that
the
living
being
is
above
all
a
thoroughfare
and
that
the
essence
of
life
is
in
the
movement
by
which
life
is
transmitted
this
contrast
between
life
in
general
and
the
forms
in
which
it
is
manifested
has
everywhere
the
same
character
it
might
be
said
that
life
tends
toward
the
utmost
possible
action
but
that
each
species
prefers
to
contribute
the
slightest
possible
effort
regarded
in
what
constitutes
its
true
essence
namely
as
a
transition
from
species
to
species
life
is
a
continually
growing
action
but
each
of
the
species
through
which
life
passes
aims
only
at
its
own
convenience
it
goes
for
that
which
demands
the
least
labor
absorbed
in
the
form
it
is
about
to
take
it
falls
into
a
partial
sleep
in
which
it
ignores
almost
all
the
rest
of
life
it
fashions
itself
so
as
to
take
the
greatest
possible
advantage
of
its
immediate
environment
with
the
least
possible
trouble
accordingly
the
act
by
which
life
goes
forward
to
the
creation
of
a
new
form
and
the
act
by
which
this
form
is
shaped
are
two
different
and
often
antagonistic
movements
the
first
is
continuous
with
the
second
but
can
not
continue
in
it
without
being
drawn
aside
from
its
direction
as
would
happen
to
a
man
leaping
if
in
order
to
clear
the
obstacle
he
had
to
turn
his
eyes
from
it
and
look
at
himself
all
the
while
living
forms
are
by
their
very
definition
forms
that
are
able
to
live
in
whatever
way
the
adaptation
of
the
organism
to
its
circumstances
is
explained
it
has
necessarily
been
sufficient
since
the
species
has
subsisted
in
this
sense
each
of
the
successive
species
that
paleontology
and
zoology
describes
was
a
carried
off
by
life
but
we
get
a
very
different
impression
when
we
refer
each
species
to
the
movement
that
has
left
it
behind
on
its
way
instead
of
to
the
conditions
into
which
it
has
been
set
often
this
movement
has
turned
aside
very
often
too
it
has
stopped
short
what
was
to
have
been
a
thoroughfare
has
become
a
terminus
from
this
new
point
of
view
failure
seems
the
rule
success
exceptional
and
always
imperfect
we
shall
see
that
of
the
four
main
directions
along
which
animal
life
bent
its
course
two
have
led
to
blind
alleys
and
in
the
other
two
the
effort
has
generally
been
out
of
proportion
to
the
result
documents
are
lacking
to
reconstruct
this
history
in
detail
but
we
can
make
out
its
main
lines
we
have
already
said
that
animals
and
vegetables
must
have
separated
soon
from
their
common
stock
the
vegetable
falling
asleep
in
immobility
the
animal
on
the
contrary
becoming
more
and
more
awake
and
marching
on
to
the
conquest
of
a
nervous
system
probably
the
effort
of
the
animal
kingdom
resulted
in
creating
organisms
still
very
simple
but
endowed
with
a
certain
freedom
of
action
and
above
all
with
a
shape
so
undecided
that
it
could
lend
itself
to
any
future
determination
these
animals
may
have
resembled
some
of
our
worms
but
with
this
difference
however
that
the
worms
living
to
which
they
could
be
compared
are
but
the
empty
and
fixed
examples
of
infinitely
plastic
forms
pregnant
with
an
unlimited
future
the
common
stock
of
the
echinoderms
molluscs
arthropods
and
vertebrates
one
danger
lay
in
wait
for
them
one
obstacle
which
might
have
stopped
the
soaring
course
of
animal
life
there
is
one
peculiarity
with
which
we
can
not
help
being
struck
when
glancing
over
the
fauna
of
primitive
times
namely
the
imprisonment
of
the
animal
in
a
more
or
less
solid
sheath
which
must
have
obstructed
and
often
even
paralyzed
its
movements
the
molluscs
of
that
time
had
a
shell
more
universally
than
those
of
the
arthropods
in
general
were
provided
with
a
carapace
most
of
them
were
crustaceans
the
more
ancient
fishes
had
a
bony
sheath
of
extreme
hardness
the
explanation
of
this
general
fact
should
be
sought
we
believe
in
a
tendency
of
soft
organisms
to
defend
themselves
against
one
another
by
making
themselves
as
far
as
possible
undevourable
each
species
in
the
act
by
which
it
comes
into
being
trends
towards
that
which
is
most
expedient
just
as
among
primitive
organisms
there
were
some
that
turned
towards
animal
life
by
refusing
to
manufacture
organic
out
of
inorganic
material
and
taking
organic
substances
ready
made
from
organisms
that
had
turned
toward
the
vegetative
life
so
among
the
animal
species
themselves
many
contrived
to
live
at
the
expense
of
other
animals
for
an
organism
that
is
animal
that
is
to
say
mobile
can
avail
itself
of
its
mobility
to
go
in
search
of
defenseless
animals
and
feed
on
them
quite
as
well
as
on
vegetables
so
the
more
species
became
mobile
the
more
they
became
voracious
and
dangerous
to
one
another
hence
a
sudden
arrest
of
the
entire
animal
world
in
its
progress
towards
higher
and
higher
mobility
for
the
hard
and
calcareous
skin
of
the
echinoderm
the
shell
of
the
mollusc
the
carapace
of
the
crustacean
and
the
ganoid
of
the
ancient
fishes
probably
all
originated
in
a
common
effort
of
the
animal
species
to
protect
themselves
against
hostile
species
but
this
behind
which
the
animal
took
shelter
constrained
it
in
its
movements
and
sometimes
fixed
it
in
one
place
if
the
vegetable
renounced
consciousness
in
wrapping
itself
in
a
cellulose
membrane
the
animal
that
shut
itself
up
in
a
citadel
or
in
armor
condemned
itself
to
a
partial
slumber
in
this
torpor
the
echinoderms
and
even
the
molluscs
live
probably
arthropods
and
vertebrates
were
threatened
with
it
too
they
escaped
however
and
to
this
fortunate
circumstance
is
due
the
expansion
of
the
highest
forms
of
life
in
two
directions
in
fact
we
see
the
impulse
of
life
to
movement
getting
the
upper
hand
again
the
fishes
exchanged
their
ganoid
for
scales
long
before
that
the
insects
had
appeared
also
disencumbered
of
the
that
had
protected
their
ancestors
both
supplemented
the
insufficiency
of
their
protective
covering
by
an
agility
that
enabled
them
to
escape
their
enemies
and
also
to
assume
the
offensive
to
choose
the
place
and
the
moment
of
encounter
we
see
a
progress
of
the
same
kind
in
the
evolution
of
human
armaments
the
first
impulse
is
to
seek
shelter
the
second
which
is
the
better
is
to
become
as
supple
as
possible
for
flight
and
above
all
for
attack
attack
being
the
most
effective
means
of
defense
so
the
heavy
hoplite
was
supplanted
by
the
legionary
the
knight
clad
in
armor
had
to
give
place
to
the
light
infantryman
and
in
a
general
way
in
the
evolution
of
life
just
as
in
the
evolution
of
human
societies
and
of
individual
destinies
the
greatest
successes
have
been
for
those
who
have
accepted
the
heaviest
risks
evidently
then
it
was
to
the
animal
interest
to
make
itself
more
mobile
as
we
said
when
speaking
of
adaptation
in
general
any
transformation
of
a
species
can
be
explained
by
its
own
particular
interest
this
will
give
the
immediate
cause
of
the
variation
but
often
only
the
most
superficial
cause
the
profound
cause
is
the
impulse
which
thrust
life
into
the
world
which
made
it
divide
into
vegetables
and
animals
which
shunted
the
animal
on
to
suppleness
of
form
and
which
at
a
certain
moment
in
the
animal
kingdom
threatened
with
torpor
secured
that
on
some
points
at
least
it
should
rouse
itself
up
and
move
forward
on
the
two
paths
along
which
the
vertebrates
and
arthropods
have
separately
evolved
development
apart
from
retrogressions
connected
with
parasitism
or
any
other
cause
has
consisted
above
all
in
the
progress
of
the
nervous
system
mobility
and
suppleness
were
sought
for
and
also
through
many
experimental
attempts
and
not
without
a
tendency
to
excess
of
substance
and
brute
force
at
the
start
variety
of
movements
but
this
quest
itself
took
place
in
divergent
directions
a
glance
at
the
nervous
system
of
the
arthropods
and
that
of
the
vertebrates
shows
us
the
difference
in
the
arthropods
the
body
is
formed
of
a
series
more
or
less
long
of
rings
set
together
motor
activity
is
thus
distributed
amongst
a
varying
sometimes
a
considerable
number
of
appendages
each
of
which
has
its
special
function
in
the
vertebrates
activity
is
concentrated
in
two
pairs
of
members
only
and
these
organs
perform
functions
which
depend
much
less
strictly
on
their
form
the
independence
becomes
complete
in
man
whose
hand
is
capable
of
any
kind
of
work
that
at
least
is
what
we
see
but
behind
what
is
seen
there
is
what
may
be
surmised
two
powers
immanent
in
life
and
originally
intermingled
which
were
bound
to
part
company
in
course
of
growth
to
define
these
powers
we
must
consider
in
the
evolution
both
of
the
arthropods
and
the
vertebrates
the
species
which
mark
the
culminating
point
of
each
how
is
this
point
to
be
determined
here
again
to
aim
at
geometrical
precision
will
lead
us
astray
there
is
no
single
simple
sign
by
which
we
can
recognize
that
one
species
is
more
advanced
than
another
on
the
same
line
of
evolution
there
are
manifold
characters
that
must
be
compared
and
weighed
in
each
particular
case
in
order
to
ascertain
to
what
extent
they
are
essential
or
accidental
and
how
far
they
must
be
taken
into
account
it
is
unquestionable
for
example
that
is
the
most
general
criterion
of
superiority
the
two
terms
being
up
to
a
certain
point
synonymous
by
success
must
be
understood
so
far
as
the
living
being
is
concerned
an
aptitude
to
develop
in
the
most
diverse
environments
through
the
greatest
possible
variety
of
obstacles
so
as
to
cover
the
widest
possible
extent
of
ground
a
species
which
claims
the
entire
earth
for
its
domain
is
truly
a
dominating
and
consequently
superior
species
such
is
the
human
species
which
represents
the
culminating
point
of
the
evolution
of
the
vertebrates
but
such
also
are
in
the
series
of
the
articulate
the
insects
and
in
particular
certain
hymenoptera
it
has
been
said
of
the
ants
that
as
man
is
lord
of
the
soil
they
are
lords
of
the
on
the
other
hand
a
group
of
species
that
has
appeared
late
may
be
a
group
of
degenerates
but
for
that
some
special
cause
of
retrogression
must
have
intervened
by
right
this
group
should
be
superior
to
the
group
from
which
it
is
derived
since
it
would
correspond
to
a
more
advanced
stage
of
evolution
now
man
is
probably
the
latest
comer
of
the
vertebrates
and
in
the
insect
series
no
species
is
later
than
the
hymenoptera
unless
it
be
the
lepidoptera
which
are
probably
degenerates
living
parasitically
on
flowering
plants
so
by
different
ways
we
are
led
to
the
same
conclusion
the
evolution
of
the
arthropods
reaches
its
culminating
point
in
the
insect
and
in
particular
in
the
hymenoptera
as
that
of
the
vertebrates
in
man
now
since
instinct
is
nowhere
so
developed
as
in
the
insect
world
and
in
no
group
of
insects
so
marvelously
as
in
the
hymenoptera
it
may
be
said
that
the
whole
evolution
of
the
animal
kingdom
apart
from
retrogressions
towards
vegetative
life
has
taken
place
on
two
divergent
paths
one
of
which
led
to
instinct
and
the
other
to
intelligence
vegetative
torpor
instinct
and
intelligence
these
then
are
the
elements
that
coincided
in
the
vital
impulsion
common
to
plants
and
animals
and
which
in
the
course
of
a
development
in
which
they
were
made
manifest
in
the
most
unforeseen
forms
have
been
dissociated
by
the
very
fact
of
their
growth
cardinal
error
which
from
aristotle
onwards
has
vitiated
most
of
the
philosophies
of
nature
is
to
see
in
vegetative
instinctive
and
rational
life
three
successive
degrees
of
the
development
of
one
and
the
same
tendency
whereas
they
are
three
divergent
directions
of
an
activity
that
has
split
up
as
it
the
difference
between
them
is
not
a
difference
of
intensity
nor
more
generally
of
degree
but
of
kind
it
is
important
to
investigate
this
point
we
have
seen
in
the
case
of
vegetable
and
animal
life
how
they
are
at
once
mutually
complementary
and
mutually
antagonistic
now
we
must
show
that
intelligence
and
instinct
also
are
opposite
and
complementary
but
let
us
first
explain
why
we
are
generally
led
to
regard
them
as
activities
of
which
one
is
superior
to
the
other
and
based
upon
it
whereas
in
reality
they
are
not
things
of
the
same
order
they
have
not
succeeded
one
another
nor
can
we
assign
to
them
different
grades
it
is
because
intelligence
and
instinct
having
originally
been
interpenetrating
retain
something
of
their
common
origin
neither
is
ever
found
in
a
pure
state
we
said
that
in
the
plant
the
consciousness
and
mobility
of
the
animal
which
lie
dormant
can
be
awakened
and
that
the
animal
lives
under
the
constant
menace
of
being
drawn
aside
to
the
vegetative
life
the
two
tendencies
that
of
the
plant
and
that
of
the
animal
were
so
thoroughly
interpenetrating
to
begin
with
that
there
has
never
been
a
complete
severance
between
them
they
haunt
each
other
continually
everywhere
we
find
them
mingled
it
is
the
proportion
that
differs
so
with
intelligence
and
instinct
there
is
no
intelligence
in
which
some
traces
of
instinct
are
not
to
be
discovered
more
especially
no
instinct
that
is
not
surrounded
with
a
fringe
of
intelligence
it
is
this
fringe
of
intelligence
that
has
been
the
cause
of
so
many
misunderstandings
from
the
fact
that
instinct
is
always
more
or
less
intelligent
it
has
been
concluded
that
instinct
and
intelligence
are
things
of
the
same
kind
that
there
is
only
a
difference
of
complexity
or
perfection
between
them
and
above
all
that
one
of
the
two
is
expressible
in
terms
of
the
other
in
reality
they
accompany
each
other
only
because
they
are
complementary
and
they
are
complementary
only
because
they
are
different
what
is
instinctive
in
instinct
being
opposite
to
what
is
intelligent
in
intelligence
we
are
bound
to
dwell
on
this
point
it
is
one
of
the
utmost
importance
let
us
say
at
the
outset
that
the
distinctions
we
are
going
to
make
will
be
too
sharply
drawn
just
because
we
wish
to
define
in
instinct
what
is
instinctive
and
in
intelligence
what
is
intelligent
whereas
all
concrete
instinct
is
mingled
with
intelligence
as
all
real
intelligence
is
penetrated
by
instinct
moreover
neither
intelligence
nor
instinct
lends
itself
to
rigid
definition
they
are
tendencies
and
not
things
also
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
in
the
present
chapter
we
are
considering
intelligence
and
instinct
as
going
out
of
life
which
deposits
them
along
its
course
now
the
life
manifested
by
an
organism
is
in
our
view
a
certain
effort
to
obtain
certain
things
from
the
material
world
no
wonder
therefore
if
it
is
the
diversity
of
this
effort
that
strikes
us
in
instinct
and
intelligence
and
if
we
see
in
these
two
modes
of
psychical
activity
above
all
else
two
different
methods
of
action
on
inert
matter
this
rather
narrow
view
of
them
has
the
advantage
of
giving
us
an
objective
means
of
distinguishing
them
in
return
however
it
gives
us
of
intelligence
in
general
and
of
instinct
in
general
only
the
mean
position
above
and
below
which
both
constantly
oscillate
for
that
reason
the
reader
must
expect
to
see
in
what
follows
only
a
diagrammatic
drawing
in
which
the
respective
outlines
of
intelligence
and
instinct
are
sharper
than
they
should
be
and
in
which
the
which
comes
from
the
indecision
of
each
and
from
their
reciprocal
encroachment
on
one
another
is
neglected
in
a
matter
so
obscure
we
can
not
strive
too
hard
for
clearness
it
will
always
be
easy
afterwards
to
soften
the
outlines
and
to
correct
what
is
too
geometrical
in
the
drawing
in
short
to
replace
the
rigidity
of
a
diagram
by
the
suppleness
of
life
to
what
date
is
it
agreed
to
ascribe
the
appearance
of
man
on
the
earth
to
the
period
when
the
first
weapons
the
first
tools
were
made
the
memorable
quarrel
over
the
discovery
of
boucher
de
perthes
in
the
quarry
of
is
not
forgotten
the
question
was
whether
real
hatchets
had
been
found
or
merely
bits
of
flint
accidentally
broken
but
that
supposing
they
were
hatchets
we
were
indeed
in
the
presence
of
intelligence
and
more
particularly
of
intelligence
no
one
doubted
for
an
instant
now
let
us
open
a
collection
of
anecdotes
on
the
intelligence
of
animals
we
shall
see
that
besides
many
acts
explicable
by
imitation
or
by
the
automatic
association
of
images
there
are
some
that
we
do
not
hesitate
to
call
intelligent
foremost
among
them
are
those
that
bear
witness
to
some
idea
of
manufacture
whether
the
animal
life
succeeds
in
fashioning
a
crude
instrument
or
uses
for
its
profit
an
object
made
by
man
the
animals
that
rank
immediately
after
man
in
the
matter
of
intelligence
the
apes
and
elephants
are
those
that
can
use
an
artificial
instrument
occasionally
below
but
not
very
far
from
them
come
those
that
a
constructed
object
for
example
the
fox
which
knows
quite
well
that
a
trap
is
a
trap
no
doubt
there
is
intelligence
wherever
there
is
inference
but
inference
which
consists
in
an
inflection
of
past
experience
in
the
direction
of
present
experience
is
already
a
beginning
of
invention
invention
becomes
complete
when
it
is
materialized
in
a
manufactured
instrument
towards
that
achievement
the
intelligence
of
animals
tends
as
towards
an
ideal
and
though
ordinarily
it
does
not
yet
succeed
in
fashioning
artificial
objects
and
in
making
use
of
them
it
is
preparing
for
this
by
the
very
variations
which
it
performs
on
the
instincts
furnished
by
nature
as
regards
human
intelligence
it
has
not
been
sufficiently
noted
that
mechanical
invention
has
been
from
the
first
its
essential
feature
that
even
our
social
life
gravitates
around
the
manufacture
and
use
of
artificial
instruments
that
the
inventions
which
strew
the
road
of
progress
have
also
traced
its
direction
this
we
hardly
realize
because
it
takes
us
longer
to
change
ourselves
than
to
change
our
tools
our
individual
and
even
social
habits
survive
a
good
while
the
circumstances
for
which
they
were
made
so
that
the
ultimate
effects
of
an
invention
are
not
observed
until
its
novelty
is
already
out
of
sight
a
century
has
elapsed
since
the
invention
of
the
and
we
are
only
just
beginning
to
feel
the
depths
of
the
shock
it
gave
us
but
the
revolution
it
has
effected
in
industry
has
nevertheless
upset
human
relations
altogether
new
ideas
are
arising
new
feelings
are
on
the
way
to
flower
in
thousands
of
years
when
seen
from
the
distance
only
the
broad
lines
of
the
present
age
will
still
be
visible
our
wars
and
our
revolutions
will
count
for
little
even
supposing
they
are
remembered
at
all
but
the
and
the
procession
of
inventions
of
every
kind
that
accompanied
it
will
perhaps
be
spoken
of
as
we
speak
of
the
bronze
or
of
the
chipped
stone
of
prehistoric
times
it
will
serve
to
define
an
age
if
we
could
rid
ourselves
of
all
pride
if
to
define
our
species
we
kept
strictly
to
what
the
historic
and
the
prehistoric
periods
show
us
to
be
the
constant
characteristic
of
man
and
of
intelligence
we
should
say
not
but
in
short
considered
in
what
seems
to
be
its
original
feature
is
the
faculty
of
manufacturing
artificial
objects
especially
tools
to
make
tools
and
of
indefinitely
varying
the
now
does
an
unintelligent
animal
also
possess
tools
or
machines
yes
certainly
but
here
the
instrument
forms
a
part
of
the
body
that
uses
it
and
corresponding
to
this
instrument
there
is
an
that
knows
how
to
use
it
true
it
can
not
be
maintained
that
instincts
consist
in
a
natural
ability
to
use
an
inborn
mechanism
such
a
definition
would
not
apply
to
the
instincts
which
romanes
called
secondary
and
more
than
one
primary
instinct
would
not
come
under
it
but
this
definition
like
that
which
we
have
provisionally
given
of
intelligence
determines
at
least
the
ideal
limit
toward
which
the
very
numerous
forms
of
instinct
are
traveling
indeed
it
has
often
been
pointed
out
that
most
instincts
are
only
the
continuance
or
rather
the
consummation
of
the
work
of
organization
itself
where
does
the
activity
of
instinct
begin
and
where
does
that
of
nature
end
we
can
not
tell
in
the
metamorphoses
of
the
larva
into
the
nymph
and
into
the
perfect
insect
metamorphoses
that
often
require
appropriate
action
and
a
kind
of
initiative
on
the
part
of
the
larva
there
is
no
sharp
line
of
demarcation
between
the
instinct
of
the
animal
and
the
organizing
work
of
living
matter
we
may
say
as
we
will
either
that
instinct
organizes
the
instruments
it
is
about
to
use
or
that
the
process
of
organization
is
continued
in
the
instinct
that
has
to
use
the
organ
the
most
marvelous
instincts
of
the
insect
do
nothing
but
develop
its
special
structure
into
movements
indeed
where
social
life
divides
the
labor
among
different
individuals
and
thus
allots
them
different
instincts
a
corresponding
difference
of
structure
is
observed
the
polymorphism
of
ants
bees
wasps
and
certain
pseudoneuroptera
is
well
known
thus
if
we
consider
only
those
typical
cases
in
which
the
complete
triumph
of
intelligence
and
of
instinct
is
seen
we
find
this
essential
difference
between
them
perfected
is
a
faculty
of
using
and
even
of
constructing
organized
instruments
intelligence
perfected
is
the
faculty
of
making
and
using
unorganized
the
advantages
and
drawbacks
of
these
two
modes
of
activity
are
obvious
instinct
finds
the
appropriate
instrument
at
hand
this
instrument
which
makes
and
repairs
itself
which
presents
like
all
the
works
of
nature
an
infinite
complexity
of
detail
combined
with
a
marvelous
simplicity
of
function
does
at
once
when
required
what
it
is
called
upon
to
do
without
difficulty
and
with
a
perfection
that
is
often
wonderful
in
return
it
retains
an
almost
invariable
structure
since
a
modification
of
it
involves
a
modification
of
the
species
instinct
is
therefore
necessarily
specialized
being
nothing
but
the
utilization
of
a
specific
instrument
for
a
specific
object
the
instrument
constructed
intelligently
on
the
contrary
is
an
imperfect
instrument
it
costs
an
effort
it
is
generally
troublesome
to
handle
but
as
it
is
made
of
unorganized
matter
it
can
take
any
form
whatsoever
serve
any
purpose
free
the
living
being
from
every
new
difficulty
that
arises
and
bestow
on
it
an
unlimited
number
of
powers
whilst
it
is
inferior
to
the
natural
instrument
for
the
satisfaction
of
immediate
wants
its
advantage
over
it
is
the
greater
the
less
urgent
the
need
above
all
it
reacts
on
the
nature
of
the
being
that
constructs
it
for
in
calling
on
him
to
exercise
a
new
function
it
confers
on
him
so
to
speak
a
richer
organization
being
an
artificial
organ
by
which
the
natural
organism
is
extended
for
every
need
that
it
satisfies
it
creates
a
new
need
and
so
instead
of
closing
like
instinct
the
round
of
action
within
which
the
animal
tends
to
move
automatically
it
lays
open
to
activity
an
unlimited
field
into
which
it
is
driven
further
and
further
and
made
more
and
more
free
but
this
advantage
of
intelligence
over
instinct
only
appears
at
a
late
stage
when
intelligence
having
raised
construction
to
a
higher
degree
proceeds
to
construct
constructive
machinery
at
the
outset
the
advantages
and
drawbacks
of
the
artificial
instrument
and
of
the
natural
instrument
balance
so
well
that
it
is
hard
to
foretell
which
of
the
two
will
secure
to
the
living
being
the
greater
empire
over
nature
we
may
surmise
that
they
began
by
being
implied
in
each
other
that
the
original
psychical
activity
included
both
at
once
and
that
if
we
went
far
enough
back
into
the
past
we
should
find
instincts
more
nearly
approaching
intelligence
than
those
of
our
insects
intelligence
nearer
to
instinct
than
that
of
our
vertebrates
intelligence
and
instinct
being
in
this
elementary
condition
prisoners
of
a
matter
which
they
are
not
yet
able
to
control
if
the
force
immanent
in
life
were
an
unlimited
force
it
might
perhaps
have
developed
instinct
and
intelligence
together
and
to
any
extent
in
the
same
organisms
but
everything
seems
to
indicate
that
this
force
is
limited
and
that
it
soon
exhausts
itself
in
its
very
manifestation
it
is
hard
for
it
to
go
far
in
several
directions
at
once
it
must
choose
now
it
has
the
choice
between
two
modes
of
acting
on
the
material
world
it
can
either
effect
this
action
by
creating
an
instrument
to
work
with
or
else
it
can
effect
it
through
an
organism
which
instead
of
possessing
the
required
instrument
naturally
will
itself
construct
it
by
fashioning
inorganic
matter
hence
intelligence
and
instinct
which
diverge
more
and
more
as
they
develop
but
which
never
entirely
separate
from
each
other
on
the
one
hand
the
most
perfect
instinct
of
the
insect
is
accompanied
by
gleams
of
intelligence
if
only
in
the
choice
of
place
time
and
materials
of
construction
the
bees
for
example
when
by
exception
they
build
in
the
open
air
invent
new
and
really
intelligent
arrangements
to
adapt
themselves
to
such
new
conditions
but
on
the
other
hand
intelligence
has
even
more
need
of
instinct
than
instinct
has
of
intelligence
for
the
power
to
give
shape
to
crude
matter
involves
already
a
superior
degree
of
organization
a
degree
to
which
the
animal
could
not
have
risen
save
on
the
wings
of
instinct
so
while
nature
has
frankly
evolved
in
the
direction
of
instinct
in
the
arthropods
we
observe
in
almost
all
the
vertebrates
the
striving
after
rather
than
the
expansion
of
intelligence
it
is
instinct
still
which
forms
the
basis
of
their
psychical
activity
but
intelligence
is
there
and
would
fain
supersede
it
intelligence
does
not
yet
succeed
in
inventing
instruments
but
at
least
it
tries
to
by
performing
as
many
variations
as
possible
on
the
instinct
which
it
would
like
to
dispense
with
it
gains
complete
only
in
man
and
this
triumph
is
attested
by
the
very
insufficiency
of
the
natural
means
at
man
disposal
for
defense
against
his
enemies
against
cold
and
hunger
this
insufficiency
when
we
strive
to
fathom
its
significance
acquires
the
value
of
a
prehistoric
document
it
is
the
final
between
intelligence
and
instinct
but
it
is
no
less
true
that
nature
must
have
hesitated
between
two
modes
of
psychical
activity
one
assured
of
immediate
success
but
limited
in
its
effects
the
other
hazardous
but
whose
conquests
if
it
should
reach
independence
might
be
extended
indefinitely
here
again
then
the
greatest
success
was
achieved
on
the
side
of
the
greatest
risk
and
intelligence
therefore
represent
two
divergent
solutions
equally
fitting
of
one
and
the
same
there
ensue
it
is
true
profound
differences
of
internal
structure
between
instinct
and
intelligence
we
shall
dwell
only
on
those
that
concern
our
present
study
let
us
say
then
that
instinct
and
intelligence
imply
two
radically
different
kinds
of
knowledge
but
some
explanations
are
first
of
all
necessary
on
the
subject
of
consciousness
in
general
it
has
been
asked
how
far
instinct
is
conscious
our
reply
is
that
there
are
a
vast
number
of
differences
and
degrees
that
instinct
is
more
or
less
conscious
in
certain
cases
unconscious
in
others
the
plant
as
we
shall
see
has
instincts
it
is
not
likely
that
these
are
accompanied
by
feeling
even
in
the
animal
there
is
hardly
any
complex
instinct
that
is
not
unconscious
in
some
part
at
least
of
its
exercise
but
here
we
must
point
out
a
difference
not
often
noticed
between
two
kinds
of
unconsciousness
that
in
which
consciousness
is
and
that
in
which
consciousness
is
both
are
equal
to
zero
but
in
one
case
the
zero
expresses
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
other
that
we
have
two
equal
quantities
of
opposite
sign
which
compensate
and
neutralize
each
other
the
unconsciousness
of
a
falling
stone
is
of
the
former
kind
the
stone
has
no
feeling
of
its
fall
is
it
the
same
with
the
unconsciousness
of
instinct
in
the
extreme
cases
in
which
instinct
is
unconscious
when
we
mechanically
perform
an
habitual
action
when
the
somnambulist
automatically
acts
his
dream
unconsciousness
may
be
absolute
but
this
is
merely
due
to
the
fact
that
the
representation
of
the
act
is
held
in
check
by
the
performance
of
the
act
itself
which
resembles
the
idea
so
perfectly
and
fits
it
so
exactly
that
consciousness
is
unable
to
find
room
between
them
is
stopped
up
by
the
proof
of
this
is
that
if
the
accomplishment
of
the
act
is
arrested
or
thwarted
by
an
obstacle
consciousness
may
reappear
it
was
there
but
neutralized
by
the
action
which
fulfilled
and
thereby
filled
the
representation
the
obstacle
creates
nothing
positive
it
simply
makes
a
void
removes
a
stopper
this
inadequacy
of
act
to
representation
is
precisely
what
we
here
call
consciousness
if
we
examine
this
point
more
closely
we
shall
find
that
consciousness
is
the
light
that
plays
around
the
zone
of
possible
actions
or
potential
activity
which
surrounds
the
action
really
performed
by
the
living
being
it
signifies
hesitation
or
choice
where
many
equally
possible
actions
are
indicated
without
there
being
any
real
action
as
in
a
deliberation
that
has
not
come
to
an
end
consciousness
is
intense
where
the
action
performed
is
the
only
action
possible
as
in
activity
of
the
somnambulistic
or
more
generally
automatic
kind
consciousness
is
reduced
to
nothing
representation
and
knowledge
exist
none
the
less
in
the
case
if
we
find
a
whole
series
of
systematized
movements
the
last
of
which
is
already
in
the
first
and
if
besides
consciousness
can
flash
out
of
them
at
the
shock
of
an
obstacle
from
this
point
of
view
consciousness
of
a
living
being
may
be
defined
as
an
arithmetical
difference
between
potential
and
real
measures
the
interval
between
representation
and
it
may
be
inferred
from
this
that
intelligence
is
likely
to
point
towards
consciousness
and
instinct
towards
unconsciousness
for
where
the
implement
to
be
used
is
organized
by
nature
the
material
furnished
by
nature
and
the
result
to
be
obtained
willed
by
nature
there
is
little
left
to
choice
the
consciousness
inherent
in
the
representation
is
therefore
counterbalanced
whenever
it
tends
to
disengage
itself
by
the
performance
of
the
act
identical
with
the
representation
which
forms
its
counterweight
where
consciousness
appears
it
does
not
so
much
light
up
the
instinct
itself
as
the
thwartings
to
which
instinct
is
subject
it
is
the
of
instinct
the
distance
between
the
act
and
the
idea
that
becomes
consciousness
so
that
consciousness
here
is
only
an
accident
essentially
consciousness
only
emphasizes
the
of
instinct
the
point
at
which
the
whole
series
of
automatic
movements
is
released
deficit
on
the
contrary
is
the
normal
state
of
intelligence
laboring
under
difficulties
is
its
very
essence
its
original
function
being
to
construct
unorganized
instruments
it
must
in
spite
of
numberless
difficulties
choose
for
this
work
the
place
and
the
time
the
form
and
the
matter
and
it
can
never
satisfy
itself
entirely
because
every
new
satisfaction
creates
new
needs
in
short
while
instinct
and
intelligence
both
involve
knowledge
this
knowledge
is
rather
and
unconscious
in
the
case
of
instinct
and
conscious
in
the
case
of
intelligence
but
it
is
a
difference
rather
of
degree
than
of
kind
so
long
as
consciousness
is
all
we
are
concerned
with
we
close
our
eyes
to
what
is
from
the
psychological
point
of
view
the
cardinal
difference
between
instinct
and
intelligence
in
order
to
get
at
this
essential
difference
we
must
without
stopping
at
the
more
or
less
brilliant
light
which
illumines
these
two
modes
of
internal
activity
go
straight
to
the
two
profoundly
different
from
each
other
upon
which
instinct
and
intelligence
are
directed
when
the
lays
its
eggs
on
the
legs
or
shoulders
of
the
horse
it
acts
as
if
it
knew
that
its
larva
has
to
develop
in
the
stomach
and
that
the
horse
in
licking
itself
will
convey
the
larva
into
its
digestive
tract
when
a
paralyzing
wasp
stings
its
victim
on
just
those
points
where
the
nervous
centres
lie
so
as
to
render
it
motionless
without
killing
it
it
acts
like
a
learned
entomologist
and
a
skilful
surgeon
rolled
into
one
but
what
shall
we
say
of
the
little
beetle
the
sitaris
whose
story
is
so
often
quoted
this
insect
lays
its
eggs
at
the
entrance
of
the
underground
passages
dug
by
a
kind
of
bee
the
anthophora
its
larva
after
long
waiting
springs
upon
the
male
anthophora
as
it
goes
out
of
the
passage
clings
to
it
and
remains
attached
until
the
nuptial
flight
when
it
seizes
the
opportunity
to
pass
from
the
male
to
the
female
and
quietly
waits
until
it
lays
its
eggs
it
then
leaps
on
the
egg
which
serves
as
a
support
for
it
in
the
honey
devours
the
egg
in
a
few
days
and
resting
on
the
shell
undergoes
its
first
metamorphosis
organized
now
to
float
on
the
honey
it
consumes
this
provision
of
nourishment
and
becomes
a
nymph
then
a
perfect
insect
everything
happens
the
larva
of
the
sitaris
from
the
moment
it
was
hatched
knew
that
the
male
anthophora
would
first
emerge
from
the
passage
that
the
nuptial
flight
would
give
it
the
means
of
conveying
itself
to
the
female
who
would
take
it
to
a
store
of
honey
sufficient
to
feed
it
after
its
transformation
that
until
this
transformation
it
could
gradually
eat
the
egg
of
the
anthophora
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
at
the
same
time
feed
itself
maintain
itself
at
the
surface
of
the
honey
and
also
suppress
the
rival
that
otherwise
would
have
come
out
of
the
egg
and
equally
all
this
happens
the
sitaris
itself
knew
that
its
larva
would
know
all
these
things
the
knowledge
if
knowledge
there
be
is
only
implicit
it
is
reflected
outwardly
in
exact
movements
instead
of
being
reflected
inwardly
in
consciousness
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
the
behavior
of
the
insect
involves
or
rather
evolves
the
idea
of
definite
things
existing
or
being
produced
in
definite
points
of
space
and
time
which
the
insect
knows
without
having
learned
them
now
if
we
look
at
intelligence
from
the
same
point
of
view
we
find
that
it
also
knows
certain
things
without
having
learned
them
but
the
knowledge
in
the
two
cases
is
of
a
very
different
order
we
must
be
careful
here
not
to
revive
again
the
old
philosophical
dispute
on
the
subject
of
innate
ideas
so
we
will
confine
ourselves
to
the
point
on
which
every
one
is
agreed
to
wit
that
the
young
child
understands
immediately
things
that
the
animal
will
never
understand
and
that
in
this
sense
intelligence
like
instinct
is
an
inherited
function
therefore
an
innate
one
but
this
innate
intelligence
although
it
is
a
faculty
of
knowing
knows
no
object
in
particular
when
the
babe
seeks
for
the
first
time
its
mother
breast
so
showing
that
it
has
knowledge
unconscious
no
doubt
of
a
thing
it
has
never
seen
we
say
just
because
the
innate
knowledge
is
in
this
case
of
a
definite
object
that
it
belongs
to
and
not
to
intelligence
does
not
then
imply
the
innate
knowledge
of
any
object
and
yet
if
intelligence
knows
nothing
by
nature
it
has
nothing
innate
what
then
if
it
be
ignorant
of
all
things
can
it
know
besides
there
are
the
child
so
far
as
intelligent
knows
neither
definite
objects
nor
a
definite
property
of
any
object
but
when
a
little
later
on
he
will
hear
an
epithet
being
applied
to
a
substantive
he
will
immediately
understand
what
it
means
the
relation
of
attribute
to
subject
is
therefore
seized
by
him
naturally
and
the
same
might
be
said
of
the
general
relation
expressed
by
the
verb
a
relation
so
immediately
conceived
by
the
mind
that
language
can
leave
it
to
be
understood
as
is
instanced
in
rudimentary
languages
which
have
no
verb
intelligence
therefore
naturally
makes
use
of
relations
of
like
with
like
of
content
to
container
of
cause
to
effect
which
are
implied
in
every
phrase
in
which
there
is
a
subject
an
attribute
and
a
verb
expressed
or
understood
may
one
say
that
it
has
knowledge
of
each
of
these
relations
in
particular
it
is
for
logicians
to
discover
whether
they
are
so
many
irreducible
relations
or
whether
they
can
be
resolved
into
relations
still
more
general
but
in
whatever
way
we
make
the
analysis
of
thought
we
always
end
with
one
or
several
general
categories
of
which
the
mind
possesses
innate
knowledge
since
it
makes
a
natural
use
of
them
let
us
say
therefore
that
in
instinct
and
intelligence
is
innate
knowledge
bears
in
the
first
case
things
in
the
second
relations
philosophers
distinguish
between
the
matter
of
our
knowledge
and
its
form
the
matter
is
what
is
given
by
the
perceptive
faculties
taken
in
the
elementary
state
the
form
is
the
totality
of
the
relations
set
up
between
these
materials
in
order
to
constitute
a
systematic
knowledge
can
the
form
without
matter
be
an
object
of
knowledge
yes
without
doubt
provided
that
this
knowledge
is
not
like
a
thing
we
possess
so
much
as
like
a
habit
we
have
contracted
a
direction
rather
than
a
state
it
is
if
we
will
a
certain
natural
bent
of
attention
the
schoolboy
who
knows
that
the
master
is
going
to
dictate
a
fraction
to
him
draws
a
line
before
he
knows
what
numerator
and
what
denominator
are
to
come
he
therefore
has
present
to
his
mind
the
general
relation
between
the
two
terms
although
he
does
not
know
either
of
them
he
knows
the
form
without
the
matter
so
is
it
prior
to
experience
with
the
categories
into
which
our
experience
comes
to
be
inserted
let
us
adopt
then
words
sanctioned
by
usage
and
give
the
distinction
between
intelligence
and
instinct
this
more
precise
formula
in
so
far
as
it
is
innate
is
the
knowledge
of
form
implies
the
knowledge
of
matter
from
this
second
point
of
view
which
is
that
of
knowledge
instead
of
action
the
force
immanent
in
life
in
general
appears
to
us
again
as
a
limited
principle
in
which
originally
two
different
and
even
divergent
modes
of
knowing
coexisted
and
intermingled
the
first
gets
at
definite
objects
immediately
in
their
materiality
itself
it
says
this
is
what
is
the
second
gets
at
no
object
in
particular
it
is
only
a
natural
power
of
relating
an
object
to
an
object
or
a
part
to
a
part
or
an
aspect
to
an
aspect
in
short
of
drawing
conclusions
when
in
possession
of
the
premisses
of
proceeding
from
what
has
been
learnt
to
what
is
still
unknown
it
does
not
say
this
it
says
only
that
the
conditions
are
such
such
will
be
the
conditioned
in
short
the
first
kind
of
knowledge
the
instinctive
would
be
formulated
in
what
philosophers
call
propositions
while
the
second
kind
the
intellectual
would
always
be
expressed
of
these
two
faculties
the
former
seems
at
first
much
preferable
to
the
other
and
it
would
be
so
in
truth
if
it
extended
to
an
endless
number
of
objects
but
in
fact
it
applies
only
to
one
special
object
and
indeed
only
to
a
restricted
part
of
that
object
of
this
at
least
its
knowledge
is
intimate
and
full
not
explicit
but
implied
in
the
accomplished
action
the
intellectual
faculty
on
the
contrary
possesses
naturally
only
an
external
and
empty
knowledge
but
it
has
thereby
the
advantage
of
supplying
a
frame
in
which
an
infinity
of
objects
may
find
room
in
turn
it
is
as
if
the
force
evolving
in
living
forms
being
a
limited
force
had
had
to
choose
between
two
kinds
of
limitation
in
the
field
of
natural
or
innate
knowledge
one
applying
to
the
of
knowledge
the
other
to
its
in
the
first
case
the
knowledge
may
be
packed
and
full
but
it
will
then
be
confined
to
one
specific
object
in
the
second
it
is
no
longer
limited
by
its
object
but
that
is
because
it
contains
nothing
being
only
a
form
without
matter
the
two
tendencies
at
first
implied
in
each
other
had
to
separate
in
order
to
grow
they
both
went
to
seek
their
fortune
in
the
world
and
turned
out
to
be
instinct
and
intelligence
such
then
are
the
two
divergent
modes
of
knowledge
by
which
intelligence
and
instinct
must
be
defined
from
the
standpoint
of
knowledge
rather
than
that
of
action
but
knowledge
and
action
are
here
only
two
aspects
of
one
and
the
same
faculty
it
is
easy
to
see
indeed
that
the
second
definition
is
only
a
new
form
of
the
first
if
instinct
is
above
all
the
faculty
of
using
an
organized
natural
instrument
it
must
involve
innate
knowledge
potential
or
unconscious
it
is
true
both
of
this
instrument
and
of
the
object
to
which
it
is
applied
instinct
is
therefore
innate
knowledge
of
a
but
intelligence
is
the
faculty
of
constructing
unorganized
that
is
to
say
artificial
instruments
if
on
its
account
nature
gives
up
endowing
the
living
being
with
the
instruments
that
may
serve
him
it
is
in
order
that
the
living
being
may
be
able
to
vary
his
construction
according
to
circumstances
the
essential
function
of
intelligence
is
therefore
to
see
the
way
out
of
a
difficulty
in
any
circumstances
whatever
to
find
what
is
most
suitable
what
answers
best
the
question
asked
hence
it
bears
essentially
on
the
relations
between
a
given
situation
and
the
means
of
utilizing
it
what
is
innate
in
intellect
therefore
is
the
tendency
to
establish
relations
and
this
tendency
implies
the
natural
knowledge
of
certain
very
general
relations
a
kind
of
stuff
that
the
activity
of
each
particular
intellect
will
cut
up
into
more
special
relations
where
activity
is
directed
toward
manufacture
therefore
knowledge
necessarily
bears
on
relations
but
this
entirely
knowledge
of
intelligence
has
an
immense
advantage
over
the
knowledge
of
instinct
a
form
just
because
it
is
empty
may
be
filled
at
will
with
any
number
of
things
in
turn
even
with
those
that
are
of
no
use
so
that
a
formal
knowledge
is
not
limited
to
what
is
practically
useful
although
it
is
in
view
of
practical
utility
that
it
has
made
its
appearance
in
the
world
an
intelligent
being
bears
within
himself
the
means
to
transcend
his
own
nature
he
transcends
himself
however
less
than
he
wishes
less
also
than
he
imagines
himself
to
do
the
purely
formal
character
of
intelligence
deprives
it
of
the
ballast
necessary
to
enable
it
to
settle
itself
on
the
objects
that
are
of
the
most
powerful
interest
to
speculation
instinct
on
the
contrary
has
the
desired
materiality
but
it
is
incapable
of
going
so
far
in
quest
of
its
object
it
does
not
speculate
here
we
reach
the
point
that
most
concerns
our
present
inquiry
the
difference
that
we
shall
now
proceed
to
denote
between
instinct
and
intelligence
is
what
the
whole
of
this
analysis
was
meant
to
bring
out
we
formulate
it
thus
are
things
that
intelligence
alone
is
able
to
seek
but
which
by
itself
it
will
never
find
these
things
instinct
alone
could
find
but
it
will
never
seek
it
is
necessary
here
to
consider
some
preliminary
details
that
concern
the
mechanism
of
intelligence
we
have
said
that
the
function
of
intelligence
is
to
establish
relations
let
us
determine
more
precisely
the
nature
of
these
relations
on
this
point
we
are
bound
to
be
either
vague
or
arbitrary
so
long
as
we
see
in
the
intellect
a
faculty
intended
for
pure
speculation
we
are
then
reduced
to
taking
the
general
frames
of
the
understanding
for
something
absolute
irreducible
and
inexplicable
the
understanding
must
have
fallen
from
heaven
with
its
form
as
each
of
us
is
born
with
his
face
this
form
may
be
defined
of
course
but
that
is
all
there
is
no
asking
why
it
is
what
it
is
rather
than
anything
else
thus
it
will
be
said
that
the
function
of
the
intellect
is
essentially
unification
that
the
common
object
of
all
its
operations
is
to
introduce
a
certain
unity
into
the
diversity
of
phenomena
and
so
forth
but
in
the
first
place
unification
is
a
vague
term
less
clear
than
relation
or
even
thought
and
says
nothing
more
and
moreover
it
might
be
asked
if
the
function
of
intelligence
is
not
to
divide
even
more
than
to
unite
finally
if
the
intellect
proceeds
as
it
does
because
it
wishes
to
unite
and
if
it
seeks
unification
simply
because
it
has
need
of
unifying
the
whole
of
our
knowledge
becomes
relative
to
certain
requirements
of
the
mind
that
probably
might
have
been
entirely
different
from
what
they
are
for
an
intellect
differently
shaped
knowledge
would
have
been
different
intellect
being
no
longer
dependent
on
anything
everything
becomes
dependent
on
it
and
so
having
placed
the
understanding
too
high
we
end
by
putting
too
low
the
knowledge
it
gives
us
knowledge
becomes
relative
as
soon
as
the
intellect
is
made
a
kind
of
we
regard
the
human
intellect
on
the
contrary
as
relative
to
the
needs
of
action
postulate
action
and
the
very
form
of
the
intellect
can
be
deduced
from
it
this
form
is
therefore
neither
irreducible
nor
inexplicable
and
precisely
because
it
is
not
independent
knowledge
can
not
be
said
to
depend
on
it
knowledge
ceases
to
be
a
product
of
the
intellect
and
becomes
in
a
certain
sense
part
and
parcel
of
reality
philosophers
will
reply
that
action
takes
place
in
an
world
that
this
order
is
itself
thought
and
that
we
beg
the
question
when
we
explain
the
intellect
by
action
which
presupposes
it
they
would
be
right
if
our
point
of
view
in
the
present
chapter
was
to
be
our
final
one
we
should
then
be
dupes
of
an
illusion
like
that
of
spencer
who
believed
that
the
intellect
is
sufficiently
explained
as
the
impression
left
on
us
by
the
general
characters
of
matter
as
if
the
order
inherent
in
matter
were
not
intelligence
itself
but
we
reserve
for
the
next
chapter
the
question
up
to
what
point
and
with
what
method
philosophy
can
attempt
a
real
genesis
of
the
intellect
at
the
same
time
as
of
matter
for
the
moment
the
problem
that
engages
our
attention
is
of
a
psychological
order
we
are
asking
what
is
the
portion
of
the
material
world
to
which
our
intellect
is
specially
adapted
to
reply
to
this
question
there
is
no
need
to
choose
a
system
of
philosophy
it
is
enough
to
take
up
the
point
of
view
of
common
sense
let
us
start
then
from
action
and
lay
down
that
the
intellect
aims
first
of
all
at
constructing
this
fabrication
is
exercised
exclusively
on
inert
matter
in
this
sense
that
even
if
it
makes
use
of
organized
material
it
treats
it
as
inert
without
troubling
about
the
life
which
animated
it
and
of
inert
matter
itself
fabrication
deals
only
with
the
solid
the
rest
escapes
by
its
very
fluidity
if
therefore
the
tendency
of
the
intellect
is
to
fabricate
we
may
expect
to
find
that
whatever
is
fluid
in
the
real
will
escape
it
in
part
and
whatever
is
life
in
the
living
will
escape
it
altogether
intelligence
as
it
leaves
the
hands
of
nature
has
for
its
chief
object
the
unorganized
when
we
pass
in
review
the
intellectual
functions
we
see
that
the
intellect
is
never
quite
at
its
ease
never
entirely
at
home
except
when
it
is
working
upon
inert
matter
more
particularly
upon
solids
what
is
the
most
general
property
of
the
material
world
it
is
extended
it
presents
to
us
objects
external
to
other
objects
and
in
these
objects
parts
external
to
parts
no
doubt
it
is
useful
to
us
in
view
of
our
ulterior
manipulation
to
regard
each
object
as
divisible
into
parts
arbitrarily
cut
up
each
part
being
again
divisible
as
we
like
and
so
on
but
it
is
above
all
necessary
for
our
present
manipulation
to
regard
the
real
object
in
hand
or
the
real
elements
into
which
we
have
resolved
it
as
and
to
treat
them
as
so
many
to
this
possibility
of
decomposing
matter
as
much
as
we
please
and
in
any
way
we
please
we
allude
when
we
speak
of
the
of
material
extension
but
this
continuity
as
we
see
it
is
nothing
else
but
our
ability
an
ability
that
matter
allows
to
us
to
choose
the
mode
of
discontinuity
we
shall
find
in
it
it
is
always
in
fact
the
mode
of
discontinuity
once
chosen
that
appears
to
us
as
the
actually
real
one
and
that
which
fixes
our
attention
just
because
it
rules
our
action
thus
discontinuity
is
thought
for
itself
it
is
thinkable
in
itself
we
form
an
idea
of
it
by
a
positive
act
of
our
mind
while
the
intellectual
representation
of
continuity
is
negative
being
at
bottom
only
the
refusal
of
our
mind
before
any
actually
given
system
of
decomposition
to
regard
it
as
the
only
possible
one
the
discontinuous
alone
does
the
intellect
form
a
clear
on
the
other
hand
the
objects
we
act
on
are
certainly
mobile
objects
but
the
important
thing
for
us
to
know
is
the
mobile
object
is
going
and
it
is
at
any
moment
of
its
passage
in
other
words
our
interest
is
directed
before
all
to
its
actual
or
future
positions
and
not
to
the
by
which
it
passes
from
one
position
to
another
progress
which
is
the
movement
itself
in
our
actions
which
are
systematized
movements
what
we
fix
our
mind
on
is
the
end
or
meaning
of
the
movement
its
design
as
a
whole
in
a
word
the
immobile
plan
of
its
execution
that
which
really
moves
in
action
interests
us
only
so
far
as
the
whole
can
be
advanced
retarded
or
stopped
by
any
incident
that
may
happen
on
the
way
from
mobility
itself
our
intellect
turns
aside
because
it
has
nothing
to
gain
in
dealing
with
it
if
the
intellect
were
meant
for
pure
theorizing
it
would
take
its
place
within
movement
for
movement
is
reality
itself
and
immobility
is
always
only
apparent
or
relative
but
the
intellect
is
meant
for
something
altogether
different
unless
it
does
violence
to
itself
it
takes
the
opposite
course
it
always
starts
from
immobility
as
if
this
were
the
ultimate
reality
when
it
tries
to
form
an
idea
of
movement
it
does
so
by
constructing
movement
out
of
immobilities
put
together
this
operation
whose
illegitimacy
and
danger
in
the
field
of
speculation
we
shall
show
later
on
it
leads
to
and
creates
artificially
insoluble
philosophical
problems
is
easily
justified
when
we
refer
it
to
its
proper
goal
intelligence
in
its
natural
state
aims
at
a
practically
useful
end
when
it
substitutes
for
movement
immobilities
put
together
it
does
not
pretend
to
reconstitute
the
movement
such
as
it
actually
is
it
merely
replaces
it
with
a
practical
equivalent
it
is
the
philosophers
who
are
mistaken
when
they
import
into
the
domain
of
speculation
a
method
of
thinking
which
is
made
for
action
but
of
this
more
anon
suffice
it
now
to
say
that
to
the
stable
and
unchangeable
our
intellect
is
attached
by
virtue
of
its
natural
disposition
immobility
alone
does
the
intellect
form
a
clear
now
fabricating
consists
in
carving
out
the
form
of
an
object
in
matter
what
is
the
most
important
is
the
form
to
be
obtained
as
to
the
matter
we
choose
that
which
is
most
convenient
but
in
order
to
choose
it
that
is
to
say
in
order
to
go
and
seek
it
among
many
others
we
must
have
tried
in
imagination
at
least
to
endow
every
kind
of
matter
with
the
form
of
the
object
conceived
in
other
words
an
intelligence
which
aims
at
fabricating
is
an
intelligence
which
never
stops
at
the
actual
form
of
things
nor
regards
it
as
final
but
on
the
contrary
looks
upon
all
matter
as
if
it
were
carvable
at
will
plato
compares
the
good
dialectician
to
the
skilful
cook
who
carves
the
animal
without
breaking
its
bones
by
following
the
articulations
marked
out
by
nature
an
intelligence
which
always
proceeded
thus
would
really
be
an
intelligence
turned
toward
speculation
but
action
and
in
particular
fabrication
requires
the
opposite
mental
tendency
it
makes
us
consider
every
actual
form
of
things
even
the
form
of
natural
things
as
artificial
and
provisional
it
makes
our
thought
efface
from
the
object
perceived
even
though
organized
and
living
the
lines
that
outwardly
mark
its
inward
structure
in
short
it
makes
us
regard
its
matter
as
indifferent
to
its
form
the
whole
of
matter
is
made
to
appear
to
our
thought
as
an
immense
piece
of
cloth
in
which
we
can
cut
out
what
we
will
and
sew
it
together
again
as
we
please
let
us
note
in
passing
that
it
is
this
power
that
we
affirm
when
we
say
that
there
is
a
that
is
to
say
a
homogeneous
and
empty
medium
infinite
and
infinitely
divisible
lending
itself
indifferently
to
any
mode
of
decomposition
whatsoever
a
medium
of
this
kind
is
never
perceived
it
is
only
conceived
what
is
perceived
is
extension
colored
resistant
divided
according
to
the
lines
which
mark
out
the
boundaries
of
real
bodies
or
of
their
real
elements
but
when
we
think
of
our
power
over
this
matter
that
is
to
say
of
our
faculty
of
decomposing
and
recomposing
it
as
we
please
we
project
the
whole
of
these
possible
decompositions
and
recompositions
behind
real
extension
in
the
form
of
a
homogeneous
space
empty
and
indifferent
which
is
supposed
to
underlie
it
this
space
is
therefore
the
plan
of
our
possible
action
on
things
although
indeed
things
have
a
natural
tendency
as
we
shall
explain
further
on
to
enter
into
a
frame
of
this
kind
it
is
a
view
taken
by
mind
the
animal
has
probably
no
idea
of
it
even
when
like
us
it
perceives
extended
things
it
is
an
idea
that
symbolizes
the
tendency
of
the
human
intellect
to
fabrication
but
this
point
must
not
detain
us
now
suffice
it
to
say
that
intellect
is
characterized
by
the
unlimited
power
of
decomposing
according
to
any
law
and
of
recomposing
into
any
we
have
now
enumerated
a
few
of
the
essential
features
of
human
intelligence
but
we
have
hitherto
considered
the
individual
in
isolation
without
taking
account
of
social
life
in
reality
man
is
a
being
who
lives
in
society
if
it
be
true
that
the
human
intellect
aims
at
fabrication
we
must
add
that
for
that
as
well
as
for
other
purposes
it
is
associated
with
other
intellects
now
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
society
whose
members
do
not
communicate
by
signs
insect
societies
probably
have
a
language
and
this
language
must
be
adapted
like
that
of
man
to
the
necessities
of
life
in
common
by
language
community
of
action
is
made
possible
but
the
requirements
of
joint
action
are
not
at
all
the
same
in
a
colony
of
ants
and
in
a
human
society
in
insect
societies
there
is
generally
polymorphism
the
subdivision
of
labor
is
natural
and
each
individual
is
riveted
by
its
structure
to
the
function
it
performs
in
any
case
these
societies
are
based
on
instinct
and
consequently
on
certain
actions
or
fabrications
that
are
more
or
less
dependent
on
the
form
of
the
organs
so
if
the
ants
for
instance
have
a
language
the
signs
which
compose
it
must
be
very
limited
in
number
and
each
of
them
once
the
species
is
formed
must
remain
invariably
attached
to
a
certain
object
or
a
certain
operation
the
sign
is
adherent
to
the
thing
signified
in
human
society
on
the
contrary
fabrication
and
action
are
of
variable
form
and
moreover
each
individual
must
learn
his
part
because
he
is
not
preordained
to
it
by
his
structure
so
a
language
is
required
which
makes
it
possible
to
be
always
passing
from
what
is
known
to
what
is
yet
to
be
known
there
must
be
a
language
whose
signs
which
can
not
be
infinite
in
number
are
extensible
to
an
infinity
of
things
this
tendency
of
the
sign
to
transfer
itself
from
one
object
to
another
is
characteristic
of
human
language
it
is
observable
in
the
little
child
as
soon
as
he
begins
to
speak
immediately
and
naturally
he
extends
the
meaning
of
the
words
he
learns
availing
himself
of
the
most
accidental
connection
or
the
most
distant
analogy
to
detach
and
transfer
elsewhere
the
sign
that
had
been
associated
in
his
hearing
with
a
particular
object
anything
can
designate
anything
such
is
the
latent
principle
of
infantine
language
this
tendency
has
been
wrongly
confused
with
the
faculty
of
generalizing
the
animals
themselves
generalize
and
moreover
a
sign
even
an
instinctive
sign
always
to
some
degree
represents
a
genus
but
what
characterizes
the
signs
of
human
language
is
not
so
much
their
generality
as
their
mobility
instinctive
sign
adherent
intelligent
sign
mobile
now
this
mobility
of
words
that
makes
them
able
to
pass
from
one
thing
to
another
has
enabled
them
to
be
extended
from
things
to
ideas
certainly
language
would
not
have
given
the
faculty
of
reflecting
to
an
intelligence
entirely
externalized
and
incapable
of
turning
homeward
an
intelligence
which
reflects
is
one
that
originally
had
a
surplus
of
energy
to
spend
over
and
above
practically
useful
efforts
it
is
a
consciousness
that
has
virtually
reconquered
itself
but
still
the
virtual
has
to
become
actual
without
language
intelligence
would
probably
have
remained
riveted
to
the
material
objects
which
it
was
interested
in
considering
it
would
have
lived
in
a
state
of
somnambulism
outside
itself
hypnotized
on
its
own
work
language
has
greatly
contributed
to
its
liberation
the
word
made
to
pass
from
one
thing
to
another
is
in
fact
by
nature
transferable
and
free
it
can
therefore
be
extended
not
only
from
one
perceived
thing
to
another
but
even
from
a
perceived
thing
to
a
recollection
of
that
thing
from
the
precise
recollection
to
a
more
fleeting
image
and
finally
from
an
image
fleeting
though
still
pictured
to
the
picturing
of
the
act
by
which
the
image
is
pictured
that
is
to
say
to
the
idea
thus
is
revealed
to
the
intelligence
hitherto
always
turned
outwards
a
whole
internal
world
the
spectacle
of
its
own
workings
it
required
only
this
opportunity
at
length
offered
by
language
it
profits
by
the
fact
that
the
word
is
an
external
thing
which
the
intelligence
can
catch
hold
of
and
cling
to
and
at
the
same
time
an
immaterial
thing
by
means
of
which
the
intelligence
can
penetrate
even
to
the
inwardness
of
its
own
work
its
first
business
was
indeed
to
make
instruments
but
this
fabrication
is
possible
only
by
the
employment
of
certain
means
which
are
not
cut
to
the
exact
measure
of
their
object
but
go
beyond
it
and
thus
allow
intelligence
a
supplementary
that
is
to
say
disinterested
work
from
the
moment
that
the
intellect
reflecting
upon
its
own
doings
perceives
itself
as
a
creator
of
ideas
as
a
faculty
of
representation
in
general
there
is
no
object
of
which
it
may
not
wish
to
have
the
idea
even
though
that
object
be
without
direct
relation
to
practical
action
that
is
why
we
said
there
are
things
that
intellect
alone
can
seek
intellect
alone
indeed
troubles
itself
about
theory
and
its
theory
would
fain
embrace
everything
not
only
inanimate
matter
over
which
it
has
a
natural
hold
but
even
life
and
thought
by
what
means
what
instruments
in
short
by
what
method
it
will
approach
these
problems
we
can
easily
guess
originally
it
was
fashioned
to
the
form
of
matter
language
itself
which
has
enabled
it
to
extend
its
field
of
operations
is
made
to
designate
things
and
nought
but
things
it
is
only
because
the
word
is
mobile
because
it
flies
from
one
thing
to
another
that
the
intellect
was
sure
to
take
it
sooner
or
later
on
the
wing
while
it
was
not
settled
on
anything
and
apply
it
to
an
object
which
is
not
a
thing
and
which
concealed
till
then
awaited
the
coming
of
the
word
to
pass
from
darkness
to
light
but
the
word
by
covering
up
this
object
again
converts
it
into
a
thing
so
intelligence
even
when
it
no
longer
operates
upon
its
own
object
follows
habits
it
has
contracted
in
that
operation
it
applies
forms
that
are
indeed
those
of
unorganized
matter
it
is
made
for
this
kind
of
work
with
this
kind
of
work
alone
is
it
fully
satisfied
and
that
is
what
intelligence
expresses
by
saying
that
thus
only
it
arrives
at
and
it
must
therefore
in
order
to
think
itself
clearly
and
distinctly
perceive
itself
under
the
form
of
discontinuity
concepts
in
fact
are
outside
each
other
like
objects
in
space
and
they
have
the
same
stability
as
such
objects
on
which
they
have
been
modeled
taken
together
they
constitute
an
intelligible
world
that
resembles
the
world
of
solids
in
its
essential
characters
but
whose
elements
are
lighter
more
diaphanous
easier
for
the
intellect
to
deal
with
than
the
image
of
concrete
things
they
are
not
indeed
the
perception
itself
of
things
but
the
representation
of
the
act
by
which
the
intellect
is
fixed
on
them
they
are
therefore
not
images
but
symbols
our
logic
is
the
complete
set
of
rules
that
must
be
followed
in
using
symbols
as
these
symbols
are
derived
from
the
consideration
of
solids
as
the
rules
for
combining
these
symbols
hardly
do
more
than
express
the
most
general
relations
among
solids
our
logic
triumphs
in
that
science
which
takes
the
solidity
of
bodies
for
its
object
that
is
in
geometry
logic
and
geometry
engender
each
other
as
we
shall
see
a
little
further
on
it
is
from
the
extension
of
a
certain
natural
geometry
suggested
by
the
most
general
and
immediately
perceived
properties
of
solids
that
natural
logic
has
arisen
then
from
this
natural
logic
in
its
turn
has
sprung
scientific
geometry
which
extends
further
and
further
the
knowledge
of
the
external
properties
of
solids
geometry
and
logic
are
strictly
applicable
to
matter
in
it
they
are
at
home
and
in
it
they
can
proceed
quite
alone
but
outside
this
domain
pure
reasoning
needs
to
be
supervised
by
common
sense
which
is
an
altogether
different
thing
thus
all
the
elementary
forces
of
the
intellect
tend
to
transform
matter
into
an
instrument
of
action
that
is
in
the
etymological
sense
of
the
word
into
an
life
not
content
with
producing
organisms
would
fain
give
them
as
an
appendage
inorganic
matter
itself
converted
into
an
immense
organ
by
the
industry
of
the
living
being
such
is
the
initial
task
it
assigns
to
intelligence
that
is
why
the
intellect
always
behaves
as
if
it
were
fascinated
by
the
contemplation
of
inert
matter
it
is
life
looking
outward
putting
itself
outside
itself
adopting
the
ways
of
unorganized
nature
in
principle
in
order
to
direct
them
in
fact
hence
its
bewilderment
when
it
turns
to
the
living
and
is
confronted
with
organization
it
does
what
it
can
it
resolves
the
organized
into
the
unorganized
for
it
can
not
without
reversing
its
natural
direction
and
twisting
about
on
itself
think
true
continuity
real
mobility
reciprocal
penetration
in
a
word
that
creative
evolution
which
is
life
consider
continuity
the
aspect
of
life
that
is
accessible
to
our
intellect
as
indeed
to
our
senses
of
which
our
intellect
is
the
extension
is
that
which
offers
a
hold
to
our
action
now
to
modify
an
object
we
have
to
perceive
it
as
divisible
and
discontinuous
from
the
point
of
view
of
positive
science
an
incomparable
progress
was
realized
when
the
organized
tissues
were
resolved
into
cells
the
study
of
the
cell
in
its
turn
has
shown
it
to
be
an
organism
whose
complexity
seems
to
grow
the
more
thoroughly
it
is
examined
the
more
science
advances
the
more
it
sees
the
number
grow
of
heterogeneous
elements
which
are
placed
together
outside
each
other
to
make
up
a
living
being
does
science
thus
get
any
nearer
to
life
does
it
not
on
the
contrary
find
that
what
is
really
life
in
the
living
seems
to
recede
with
every
step
by
which
it
pushes
further
the
detail
of
the
parts
combined
there
is
indeed
already
among
scientists
a
tendency
to
regard
the
substance
of
the
organism
as
continuous
and
the
cell
as
an
artificial
entity
but
supposing
this
view
were
finally
to
prevail
it
could
only
lead
on
deeper
study
to
some
other
mode
of
analyzing
of
the
living
being
and
so
to
a
new
discontinuity
although
less
removed
perhaps
from
the
real
continuity
of
life
the
truth
is
that
this
continuity
can
not
be
thought
by
the
intellect
while
it
follows
its
natural
movement
it
implies
at
once
the
multiplicity
of
elements
and
the
interpenetration
of
all
by
all
two
conditions
that
can
hardly
be
reconciled
in
the
field
in
which
our
industry
and
consequently
our
intellect
is
engaged
just
as
we
separate
in
space
we
fix
in
time
the
intellect
is
not
made
to
think
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
that
is
to
say
the
continuity
of
a
change
that
is
pure
mobility
we
shall
not
dwell
here
on
this
point
which
we
propose
to
study
in
a
special
chapter
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
intellect
represents
as
a
series
of
each
of
which
is
homogeneous
with
itself
and
consequently
does
not
change
is
our
attention
called
to
the
internal
change
of
one
of
these
states
at
once
we
decompose
it
into
another
series
of
states
which
reunited
will
be
supposed
to
make
up
this
internal
modification
each
of
these
new
states
must
be
invariable
or
else
their
internal
change
if
we
are
forced
to
notice
it
must
be
resolved
again
into
a
fresh
series
of
invariable
states
and
so
on
to
infinity
here
again
thinking
consists
in
reconstituting
and
naturally
it
is
with
elements
and
consequently
with
elements
that
we
reconstitute
so
that
though
we
may
do
our
best
to
imitate
the
mobility
of
becoming
by
an
addition
that
is
ever
going
on
becoming
itself
slips
through
our
fingers
just
when
we
think
we
are
holding
it
tight
precisely
because
it
is
always
trying
to
reconstitute
and
to
reconstitute
with
what
is
given
the
intellect
lets
what
is
in
each
moment
of
a
history
escape
it
does
not
admit
the
unforeseeable
it
rejects
all
creation
that
definite
antecedents
bring
forth
a
definite
consequent
calculable
as
a
function
of
them
is
what
satisfies
our
intellect
that
a
definite
end
calls
forth
definite
means
to
attain
it
is
what
we
also
understand
in
both
cases
we
have
to
do
with
the
known
which
is
combined
with
the
known
in
short
with
the
old
which
is
repeated
our
intellect
is
there
at
its
ease
and
whatever
be
the
object
it
will
abstract
separate
eliminate
so
as
to
substitute
for
the
object
itself
if
necessary
an
approximate
equivalent
in
which
things
will
happen
in
this
way
but
that
each
instant
is
a
fresh
endowment
that
the
new
is
ever
upspringing
that
the
form
just
come
into
existence
although
once
it
may
be
regarded
as
an
effect
determined
by
its
causes
could
never
have
been
foreseen
because
the
causes
here
unique
in
their
kind
are
part
of
the
effect
have
come
into
existence
with
it
and
are
determined
by
it
as
much
as
they
determine
it
all
this
we
can
feel
within
ourselves
and
also
divine
by
sympathy
outside
ourselves
but
we
can
not
think
it
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
nor
express
it
in
terms
of
pure
understanding
no
wonder
at
that
we
must
remember
what
our
intellect
is
meant
for
the
causality
it
seeks
and
finds
everywhere
expresses
the
very
mechanism
of
our
industry
in
which
we
go
on
recomposing
the
same
whole
with
the
same
parts
repeating
the
same
movements
to
obtain
the
same
result
the
finality
it
understands
best
is
the
finality
of
our
industry
in
which
we
work
on
a
model
given
in
advance
that
is
to
say
old
or
composed
of
elements
already
known
as
to
invention
properly
so
called
which
is
however
the
point
of
departure
of
industry
itself
our
intellect
does
not
succeed
in
grasping
it
in
its
that
is
to
say
in
its
indivisibility
nor
in
its
that
is
to
say
in
its
creativeness
explaining
it
always
consists
in
resolving
it
it
the
unforeseeable
and
new
into
elements
old
or
known
arranged
in
a
different
order
the
intellect
can
no
more
admit
complete
novelty
than
real
becoming
that
is
to
say
here
again
it
lets
an
essential
aspect
of
life
escape
as
if
it
were
not
intended
to
think
such
an
object
all
our
analyses
bring
us
to
this
conclusion
but
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
go
into
such
long
details
concerning
the
mechanism
of
intellectual
working
it
is
enough
to
consider
the
results
we
see
that
the
intellect
so
skilful
in
dealing
with
the
inert
is
awkward
the
moment
it
touches
the
living
whether
it
wants
to
treat
the
life
of
the
body
or
the
life
of
the
mind
it
proceeds
with
the
rigor
the
stiffness
and
the
brutality
of
an
instrument
not
designed
for
such
use
the
history
of
hygiene
or
of
pedagogy
teaches
us
much
in
this
matter
when
we
think
of
the
cardinal
urgent
and
constant
need
we
have
to
preserve
our
bodies
and
to
raise
our
souls
of
the
special
facilities
given
to
each
of
us
in
this
field
to
experiment
continually
on
ourselves
and
on
others
of
the
palpable
injury
by
which
the
wrongness
of
a
medical
or
pedagogical
practise
is
both
made
manifest
and
punished
at
once
we
are
amazed
at
the
stupidity
and
especially
at
the
persistence
of
errors
we
may
easily
find
their
origin
in
the
natural
obstinacy
with
which
we
treat
the
living
like
the
lifeless
and
think
all
reality
however
fluid
under
the
form
of
the
sharply
defined
solid
we
are
at
ease
only
in
the
discontinuous
in
the
immobile
in
the
dead
intellect
is
characterized
by
a
natural
inability
to
comprehend
instinct
on
the
contrary
is
molded
on
the
very
form
of
life
while
intelligence
treats
everything
mechanically
instinct
proceeds
so
to
speak
organically
if
the
consciousness
that
slumbers
in
it
should
awake
if
it
were
wound
up
into
knowledge
instead
of
being
wound
off
into
action
if
we
could
ask
and
it
could
reply
it
would
give
up
to
us
the
most
intimate
secrets
of
life
for
it
only
carries
out
further
the
work
by
which
life
organizes
matter
so
that
we
can
not
say
as
has
often
been
shown
where
organization
ends
and
where
instinct
begins
when
the
little
chick
is
breaking
its
shell
with
a
peck
of
its
beak
it
is
acting
by
instinct
and
yet
it
does
but
carry
on
the
movement
which
has
borne
it
through
embryonic
life
inversely
in
the
course
of
embryonic
life
itself
especially
when
the
embryo
lives
freely
in
the
form
of
a
larva
many
of
the
acts
accomplished
must
be
referred
to
instinct
the
most
essential
of
the
primary
instincts
are
really
therefore
vital
processes
the
potential
consciousness
that
accompanies
them
is
generally
actualized
only
at
the
outset
of
the
act
and
leaves
the
rest
of
the
process
to
go
on
by
itself
it
would
only
have
to
expand
more
widely
and
then
dive
into
its
own
depth
completely
to
be
one
with
the
generative
force
of
life
when
we
see
in
a
living
body
thousands
of
cells
working
together
to
a
common
end
dividing
the
task
between
them
living
each
for
itself
at
the
same
time
as
for
the
others
preserving
itself
feeding
itself
reproducing
itself
responding
to
the
menace
of
danger
by
appropriate
defensive
reactions
how
can
we
help
thinking
of
so
many
instincts
and
yet
these
are
the
natural
functions
of
the
cell
the
constitutive
elements
of
its
vitality
on
the
other
hand
when
we
see
the
bees
of
a
hive
forming
a
system
so
strictly
organized
that
no
individual
can
live
apart
from
the
others
beyond
a
certain
time
even
though
furnished
with
food
and
shelter
how
can
we
help
recognizing
that
the
hive
is
really
and
not
metaphorically
a
single
organism
of
which
each
bee
is
a
cell
united
to
the
others
by
invisible
bonds
the
instinct
that
animates
the
bee
is
indistinguishable
then
from
the
force
that
animates
the
cell
or
is
only
a
prolongation
of
that
force
in
extreme
cases
like
this
instinct
coincides
with
the
work
of
organization
of
course
there
are
degrees
of
perfection
in
the
same
instinct
between
the
and
the
for
instance
the
distance
is
great
and
we
pass
from
one
to
the
other
through
a
great
number
of
intermediaries
which
correspond
to
so
many
complications
of
the
social
life
but
the
same
diversity
is
found
in
the
functioning
of
histological
elements
belonging
to
different
tissues
more
or
less
akin
in
both
cases
there
are
manifold
variations
on
one
and
the
same
theme
the
constancy
of
the
theme
is
manifest
however
and
the
variations
only
fit
it
to
the
diversity
of
the
circumstances
now
in
both
cases
in
the
instinct
of
the
animal
and
in
the
vital
properties
of
the
cell
the
same
knowledge
and
the
same
ignorance
are
shown
all
goes
on
as
if
the
cell
knew
of
the
other
cells
what
concerns
itself
as
if
the
animal
knew
of
the
other
animals
what
it
can
utilize
all
else
remaining
in
shade
it
seems
as
if
life
as
soon
as
it
has
become
bound
up
in
a
species
is
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
its
own
work
save
at
one
or
two
points
that
are
of
vital
concern
to
the
species
just
arisen
is
it
not
plain
that
life
goes
to
work
here
exactly
like
consciousness
exactly
like
memory
we
trail
behind
us
unawares
the
whole
of
our
past
but
our
memory
pours
into
the
present
only
the
odd
recollection
or
two
that
in
some
way
complete
our
present
situation
thus
the
instinctive
knowledge
which
one
species
possesses
of
another
on
a
certain
particular
point
has
its
root
in
the
very
unity
of
life
which
is
to
use
the
expression
of
an
ancient
philosopher
a
whole
sympathetic
to
itself
it
is
impossible
to
consider
some
of
the
special
instincts
of
the
animal
and
of
the
plant
evidently
arisen
in
extraordinary
circumstances
without
relating
them
to
those
recollections
seemingly
forgotten
which
spring
up
suddenly
under
the
pressure
of
an
urgent
need
no
doubt
many
secondary
instincts
and
also
many
varieties
of
primary
instinct
admit
of
a
scientific
explanation
yet
it
is
doubtful
whether
science
with
its
present
methods
of
explanation
will
ever
succeed
in
analyzing
instinct
completely
the
reason
is
that
instinct
and
intelligence
are
two
divergent
developments
of
one
and
the
same
principle
which
in
the
one
case
remains
within
itself
in
the
other
steps
out
of
itself
and
becomes
absorbed
in
the
utilization
of
inert
matter
this
gradual
divergence
testifies
to
a
radical
incompatibility
and
points
to
the
fact
that
it
is
impossible
for
intelligence
to
reabsorb
instinct
that
which
is
instinctive
in
instinct
can
not
be
expressed
in
terms
of
intelligence
nor
consequently
can
it
be
analyzed
a
man
born
blind
who
had
lived
among
others
born
blind
could
not
be
made
to
believe
in
the
possibility
of
perceiving
a
distant
object
without
first
perceiving
all
the
objects
in
between
yet
vision
performs
this
miracle
in
a
certain
sense
the
blind
man
is
right
since
vision
having
its
origin
in
the
stimulation
of
the
retina
by
the
vibrations
of
the
light
is
nothing
else
in
fact
but
a
retinal
touch
such
is
indeed
the
explanation
for
the
function
of
science
is
just
to
express
all
perceptions
in
terms
of
touch
but
we
have
shown
elsewhere
that
the
philosophical
explanation
of
perception
if
it
may
still
be
called
an
explanation
must
be
of
another
kind
now
instinct
also
is
a
knowledge
at
a
distance
it
has
the
same
relation
to
intelligence
that
vision
has
to
touch
science
can
not
do
otherwise
than
express
it
in
terms
of
intelligence
but
in
so
doing
it
constructs
an
imitation
of
instinct
rather
than
penetrates
within
it
any
one
can
convince
himself
of
this
by
studying
the
ingenious
theories
of
evolutionist
biology
they
may
be
reduced
to
two
types
which
are
often
intermingled
one
type
following
the
principles
of
regards
instinct
as
a
sum
of
accidental
differences
preserved
by
selection
such
and
such
a
useful
behavior
naturally
adopted
by
the
individual
in
virtue
of
an
accidental
predisposition
of
the
germ
has
been
transmitted
from
germ
to
germ
waiting
for
chance
to
add
fresh
improvements
to
it
by
the
same
method
the
other
type
regards
instinct
as
lapsed
intelligence
the
action
found
useful
by
the
species
or
by
certain
of
its
representatives
is
supposed
to
have
engendered
a
habit
which
by
hereditary
transmission
has
become
an
instinct
of
these
two
types
of
theory
the
first
has
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
bring
in
hereditary
transmission
without
raising
grave
objection
for
the
accidental
modification
which
it
places
at
the
origin
of
the
instinct
is
not
supposed
to
have
been
acquired
by
the
individual
but
to
have
been
inherent
in
the
germ
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
absolutely
incapable
of
explaining
instincts
as
sagacious
as
those
of
most
insects
these
instincts
surely
could
not
have
attained
all
at
once
their
present
degree
of
complexity
they
have
probably
evolved
but
in
a
hypothesis
like
that
of
the
the
evolution
of
instinct
could
have
come
to
pass
only
by
the
progressive
addition
of
new
pieces
which
in
some
way
by
happy
accidents
came
to
fit
into
the
old
now
it
is
evident
that
in
most
cases
instinct
could
not
have
perfected
itself
by
simple
accretion
each
new
piece
really
requires
if
all
is
not
to
be
spoiled
a
complete
recasting
of
the
whole
how
could
mere
chance
work
a
recasting
of
the
kind
i
agree
that
an
accidental
modification
of
the
germ
may
be
passed
on
hereditarily
and
may
somehow
wait
for
fresh
accidental
modifications
to
come
and
complicate
it
i
agree
also
that
natural
selection
may
eliminate
all
those
of
the
more
complicated
forms
of
instinct
that
are
not
fit
to
survive
still
in
order
that
the
life
of
the
instinct
may
evolve
complications
fit
to
survive
have
to
be
produced
now
they
will
be
produced
only
if
in
certain
cases
the
addition
of
a
new
element
brings
about
the
correlative
change
of
all
the
old
elements
no
one
will
maintain
that
chance
could
perform
such
a
miracle
in
one
form
or
another
we
shall
appeal
to
intelligence
we
shall
suppose
that
it
is
by
an
effort
more
or
less
conscious
that
the
living
being
develops
a
higher
instinct
but
then
we
shall
have
to
admit
that
an
acquired
habit
can
become
hereditary
and
that
it
does
so
regularly
enough
to
ensure
an
evolution
the
thing
is
doubtful
to
put
it
mildly
even
if
we
could
refer
the
instincts
of
animals
to
habits
intelligently
acquired
and
hereditarily
transmitted
it
is
not
clear
how
this
sort
of
explanation
could
be
extended
to
the
vegetable
world
where
effort
is
never
intelligent
even
supposing
it
is
sometimes
conscious
and
yet
when
we
see
with
what
sureness
and
precision
climbing
plants
use
their
tendrils
what
marvelously
combined
manoeuvres
the
orchids
perform
to
procure
their
fertilization
by
means
of
insects
how
can
we
help
thinking
that
these
are
so
many
instincts
this
is
not
saying
that
the
theory
of
the
must
be
altogether
rejected
any
more
than
that
of
the
the
first
are
probably
right
in
holding
that
evolution
takes
place
from
germ
to
germ
rather
than
from
individual
to
individual
the
second
are
right
in
saying
that
at
the
origin
of
instinct
there
is
an
effort
although
it
is
something
quite
different
we
believe
from
an
effort
but
the
former
are
probably
wrong
when
they
make
the
evolution
of
instinct
an
evolution
and
the
latter
when
they
regard
the
effort
from
which
instinct
proceeds
as
an
effort
the
effort
by
which
a
species
modifies
its
instinct
and
modifies
itself
as
well
must
be
a
much
deeper
thing
dependent
solely
neither
on
circumstances
nor
on
individuals
it
is
not
purely
accidental
although
accident
has
a
large
place
in
it
and
it
does
not
depend
solely
on
the
initiative
of
individuals
although
individuals
collaborate
in
it
compare
the
different
forms
of
the
same
instinct
in
different
species
of
hymenoptera
the
impression
derived
is
not
always
that
of
an
increasing
complexity
made
of
elements
that
have
been
added
together
one
after
the
other
nor
does
it
suggest
the
idea
of
steps
up
a
ladder
rather
do
we
think
in
many
cases
at
least
of
the
circumference
of
a
circle
from
different
points
of
which
these
different
varieties
have
started
all
facing
the
same
centre
all
making
an
effort
in
that
direction
but
each
approaching
it
only
to
the
extent
of
its
means
and
to
the
extent
also
to
which
this
central
point
has
been
illumined
for
it
in
other
words
instinct
is
everywhere
complete
but
it
is
more
or
less
simplified
and
above
all
simplified
on
the
other
hand
in
cases
where
we
do
get
the
impression
of
an
ascending
scale
as
if
one
and
the
same
instinct
had
gone
on
complicating
itself
more
and
more
in
one
direction
and
along
a
straight
line
the
species
which
are
thus
arranged
by
their
instincts
into
a
linear
series
are
by
no
means
always
akin
thus
the
comparative
study
in
recent
years
of
the
social
instinct
in
the
different
apidae
proves
that
the
instinct
of
the
meliponines
is
intermediary
in
complexity
between
the
still
rudimentary
tendency
of
the
humble
bees
and
the
consummate
science
of
the
true
bees
yet
there
can
be
no
kinship
between
the
bees
and
the
meliponines
most
likely
the
degree
of
complexity
of
these
different
societies
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
greater
or
smaller
number
of
added
elements
we
seem
rather
to
be
before
a
which
had
first
been
transposed
the
theme
as
a
whole
into
a
certain
number
of
tones
and
on
which
still
the
whole
theme
different
variations
had
been
played
some
very
simple
others
very
skilful
as
to
the
original
theme
it
is
everywhere
and
nowhere
it
is
in
vain
that
we
try
to
express
it
in
terms
of
any
idea
it
must
have
been
originally
rather
than
we
get
the
same
impression
before
the
paralyzing
instinct
of
certain
wasps
we
know
that
the
different
species
of
hymenoptera
that
have
this
paralyzing
instinct
lay
their
eggs
in
spiders
beetles
or
caterpillars
which
having
first
been
subjected
by
the
wasp
to
a
skilful
surgical
operation
will
go
on
living
motionless
a
certain
number
of
days
and
thus
provide
the
larvae
with
fresh
meat
in
the
sting
which
they
give
to
the
of
their
victim
in
order
to
destroy
its
power
of
moving
without
killing
it
these
different
species
of
hymenoptera
take
into
account
so
to
speak
the
different
species
of
prey
they
respectively
attack
the
scolia
which
attacks
a
larva
of
the
stings
it
in
one
point
only
but
in
this
point
the
motor
ganglia
are
concentrated
and
those
ganglia
alone
the
stinging
of
other
ganglia
might
cause
death
and
putrefaction
which
it
must
avoid
the
sphex
which
has
chosen
the
cricket
for
its
victim
knows
that
the
cricket
has
three
which
serve
its
three
pairs
of
legs
or
at
least
it
acts
as
if
it
knew
this
it
stings
the
insect
first
under
the
neck
then
behind
the
prothorax
and
then
where
the
thorax
joins
the
abdomen
the
ammophila
hirsuta
gives
nine
successive
strokes
of
its
sting
upon
nine
of
its
caterpillar
and
then
seizes
the
head
and
squeezes
it
in
its
mandibles
enough
to
cause
paralysis
without
death
the
general
theme
is
the
necessity
of
paralyzing
without
killing
the
variations
are
subordinated
to
the
structure
of
the
victim
on
which
they
are
played
no
doubt
the
operation
is
not
always
perfect
it
has
recently
been
shown
that
the
ammophila
sometimes
kills
the
caterpillar
instead
of
paralyzing
it
that
sometimes
also
it
paralyzes
it
incompletely
but
because
instinct
is
like
intelligence
fallible
because
it
also
shows
individual
deviations
it
does
not
at
all
follow
that
the
instinct
of
the
ammophila
has
been
acquired
as
has
been
claimed
by
tentative
intelligent
experiments
even
supposing
that
the
ammophila
has
come
in
course
of
time
to
recognize
one
after
another
by
tentative
experiment
the
points
of
its
victim
which
must
be
stung
to
render
it
motionless
and
also
the
special
treatment
that
must
be
inflicted
on
the
head
to
bring
about
paralysis
without
death
how
can
we
imagine
that
elements
so
special
of
a
knowledge
so
precise
have
been
regularly
transmitted
one
by
one
by
heredity
if
in
all
our
present
experience
there
were
a
single
indisputable
example
of
a
transmission
of
this
kind
the
inheritance
of
acquired
characters
would
be
questioned
by
no
one
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
hereditary
transmission
of
a
contracted
habit
is
effected
in
an
irregular
and
far
from
precise
manner
supposing
it
is
ever
really
effected
at
all
but
the
whole
difficulty
comes
from
our
desire
to
express
the
knowledge
of
the
hymenoptera
in
terms
of
intelligence
it
is
this
that
compels
us
to
compare
the
ammophila
with
the
entomologist
who
knows
the
caterpillar
as
he
knows
everything
else
from
the
outside
and
without
having
on
his
part
a
special
or
vital
interest
the
ammophila
we
imagine
must
learn
one
by
one
like
the
entomologist
the
positions
of
the
of
the
caterpillar
must
acquire
at
least
the
practical
knowledge
of
these
positions
by
trying
the
effects
of
its
sting
but
there
is
no
need
for
such
a
view
if
we
suppose
a
in
the
etymological
sense
of
the
word
between
the
ammophila
and
its
victim
which
teaches
it
from
within
so
to
say
concerning
the
vulnerability
of
the
caterpillar
this
feeling
of
vulnerability
might
owe
nothing
to
outward
perception
but
result
from
the
mere
presence
together
of
the
ammophila
and
the
caterpillar
considered
no
longer
as
two
organisms
but
as
two
activities
it
would
express
in
a
concrete
form
the
of
the
one
to
the
other
certainly
a
scientific
theory
can
not
appeal
to
considerations
of
this
kind
it
must
not
put
action
before
organization
sympathy
before
perception
and
knowledge
but
once
more
either
philosophy
has
nothing
to
see
here
or
its
rôle
begins
where
that
of
science
ends
whether
it
makes
instinct
a
compound
reflex
or
a
habit
formed
intelligently
that
has
become
automatism
or
a
sum
of
small
accidental
advantages
accumulated
and
fixed
by
selection
in
every
case
science
claims
to
resolve
instinct
completely
either
into
actions
or
into
mechanisms
built
up
piece
by
piece
like
those
combined
by
our
i
agree
indeed
that
science
is
here
within
its
function
it
gives
us
in
default
of
a
real
analysis
of
the
object
a
translation
of
this
object
in
terms
of
intelligence
but
is
it
not
plain
that
science
itself
invites
philosophy
to
consider
things
in
another
way
if
our
biology
was
still
that
of
aristotle
if
it
regarded
the
series
of
living
beings
as
unilinear
if
it
showed
us
the
whole
of
life
evolving
towards
intelligence
and
passing
to
that
end
through
sensibility
and
instinct
we
should
be
right
we
the
intelligent
beings
in
turning
back
towards
the
earlier
and
consequently
inferior
manifestations
of
life
and
in
claiming
to
fit
them
without
deforming
them
into
the
molds
of
our
understanding
but
one
of
the
clearest
results
of
biology
has
been
to
show
that
evolution
has
taken
place
along
divergent
lines
it
is
at
the
extremity
of
two
of
these
lines
the
two
principal
that
we
find
intelligence
and
instinct
in
forms
almost
pure
why
then
should
instinct
be
resolvable
into
intelligent
elements
why
even
into
terms
entirely
intelligible
is
it
not
obvious
that
to
think
here
of
the
intelligent
or
of
the
absolutely
intelligible
is
to
go
back
to
the
aristotelian
theory
of
nature
no
doubt
it
is
better
to
go
back
to
that
than
to
stop
short
before
instinct
as
before
an
unfathomable
mystery
but
though
instinct
is
not
within
the
domain
of
intelligence
it
is
not
situated
beyond
the
limits
of
mind
in
the
phenomena
of
feeling
in
unreflecting
sympathy
and
antipathy
we
experience
in
ourselves
though
under
a
much
vaguer
form
and
one
too
much
penetrated
with
intelligence
something
of
what
must
happen
in
the
consciousness
of
an
insect
acting
by
instinct
evolution
does
but
sunder
in
order
to
develop
them
to
the
end
elements
which
at
their
origin
interpenetrated
each
other
more
precisely
intelligence
is
before
anything
else
the
faculty
of
relating
one
point
of
space
to
another
one
material
object
to
another
it
applies
to
all
things
but
remains
outside
them
and
of
a
deep
cause
it
perceives
only
the
effects
spread
out
side
by
side
whatever
be
the
force
that
is
at
work
in
the
genesis
of
the
nervous
system
of
the
caterpillar
to
our
eyes
and
our
intelligence
it
is
only
a
juxtaposition
of
nerves
and
nervous
centres
it
is
true
that
we
thus
get
the
whole
outer
effect
of
it
the
ammophila
no
doubt
discerns
but
a
very
little
of
that
force
just
what
concerns
itself
but
at
least
it
discerns
it
from
within
quite
otherwise
than
by
a
process
of
knowledge
by
an
intuition
rather
than
which
is
probably
like
what
we
call
divining
sympathy
a
very
significant
fact
is
the
swing
to
and
fro
of
scientific
theories
of
instinct
from
regarding
it
as
intelligent
to
regarding
it
as
simply
intelligible
or
shall
i
say
between
likening
it
to
an
intelligence
lapsed
and
reducing
it
to
a
pure
mechanism
each
of
these
systems
of
explanation
triumphs
in
its
criticism
of
the
other
the
first
when
it
shows
us
that
instinct
can
not
be
a
mere
reflex
the
other
when
it
declares
that
instinct
is
something
different
from
intelligence
even
fallen
into
unconsciousness
what
can
this
mean
but
that
they
are
two
symbolisms
equally
acceptable
in
certain
respects
and
in
other
respects
equally
inadequate
to
their
object
the
concrete
explanation
no
longer
scientific
but
metaphysical
must
be
sought
along
quite
another
path
not
in
the
direction
of
intelligence
but
in
that
of
sympathy
instinct
is
sympathy
if
this
sympathy
could
extend
its
object
and
also
reflect
upon
itself
it
would
give
us
the
key
to
vital
operations
just
as
intelligence
developed
and
disciplined
guides
us
into
matter
for
we
can
not
too
often
repeat
it
intelligence
and
instinct
are
turned
in
opposite
directions
the
former
towards
inert
matter
the
latter
towards
life
intelligence
by
means
of
science
which
is
its
work
will
deliver
up
to
us
more
and
more
completely
the
secret
of
physical
operations
of
life
it
brings
us
and
moreover
only
claims
to
bring
us
a
translation
in
terms
of
inertia
it
goes
all
round
life
taking
from
outside
the
greatest
possible
number
of
views
of
it
drawing
it
into
itself
instead
of
entering
into
it
but
it
is
to
the
very
inwardness
of
life
that
leads
us
by
intuition
i
mean
instinct
that
has
become
disinterested
capable
of
reflecting
upon
its
object
and
of
enlarging
it
indefinitely
that
an
effort
of
this
kind
is
not
impossible
is
proved
by
the
existence
in
man
of
an
aesthetic
faculty
along
with
normal
perception
our
eye
perceives
the
features
of
the
living
being
merely
as
assembled
not
as
mutually
organized
the
intention
of
life
the
simple
movement
that
runs
through
the
lines
that
binds
them
together
and
gives
them
significance
escapes
it
this
intention
is
just
what
the
artist
tries
to
regain
in
placing
himself
back
within
the
object
by
a
kind
of
sympathy
in
breaking
down
by
an
effort
of
intuition
the
barrier
that
space
puts
up
between
him
and
his
model
it
is
true
that
this
aesthetic
intuition
like
external
perception
only
attains
the
individual
but
we
can
conceive
an
inquiry
turned
in
the
same
direction
as
art
which
would
take
life
for
its
object
just
as
physical
science
in
following
to
the
end
the
direction
pointed
out
by
external
perception
prolongs
the
individual
facts
into
general
laws
no
doubt
this
philosophy
will
never
obtain
a
knowledge
of
its
object
comparable
to
that
which
science
has
of
its
own
intelligence
remains
the
luminous
nucleus
around
which
instinct
even
enlarged
and
purified
into
intuition
forms
only
a
vague
nebulosity
but
in
default
of
knowledge
properly
so
called
reserved
to
pure
intelligence
intuition
may
enable
us
to
grasp
what
it
is
that
intelligence
fails
to
give
us
and
indicate
the
means
of
supplementing
it
on
the
one
hand
it
will
utilize
the
mechanism
of
intelligence
itself
to
show
how
intellectual
molds
cease
to
be
strictly
applicable
and
on
the
other
hand
by
its
own
work
it
will
suggest
to
us
the
vague
feeling
if
nothing
more
of
what
must
take
the
place
of
intellectual
molds
thus
intuition
may
bring
the
intellect
to
recognize
that
life
does
not
quite
go
into
the
category
of
the
many
nor
yet
into
that
of
the
one
that
neither
mechanical
causality
nor
finality
can
give
a
sufficient
interpretation
of
the
vital
process
then
by
the
sympathetic
communication
which
it
establishes
between
us
and
the
rest
of
the
living
by
the
expansion
of
our
consciousness
which
it
brings
about
it
introduces
us
into
life
own
domain
which
is
reciprocal
interpenetration
endlessly
continued
creation
but
though
it
thereby
transcends
intelligence
it
is
from
intelligence
that
has
come
the
push
that
has
made
it
rise
to
the
point
it
has
reached
without
intelligence
it
would
have
remained
in
the
form
of
instinct
riveted
to
the
special
object
of
its
practical
interest
and
turned
outward
by
it
into
movements
of
locomotion
how
theory
of
knowledge
must
take
account
of
these
two
faculties
intellect
and
intuition
and
how
also
for
want
of
establishing
a
sufficiently
clear
distinction
between
them
it
becomes
involved
in
inextricable
difficulties
creating
phantoms
of
ideas
to
which
there
cling
phantoms
of
problems
we
shall
endeavor
to
show
a
little
further
on
we
shall
see
that
the
problem
of
knowledge
from
this
point
of
view
is
one
with
the
metaphysical
problem
and
that
both
one
and
the
other
depend
upon
experience
on
the
one
hand
indeed
if
intelligence
is
charged
with
matter
and
instinct
with
life
we
must
squeeze
them
both
in
order
to
get
the
double
essence
from
them
metaphysics
is
therefore
dependent
upon
theory
of
knowledge
but
on
the
other
hand
if
consciousness
has
thus
split
up
into
intuition
and
intelligence
it
is
because
of
the
need
it
had
to
apply
itself
to
matter
at
the
same
time
as
it
had
to
follow
the
stream
of
life
the
double
form
of
consciousness
is
then
due
to
the
double
form
of
the
real
and
theory
of
knowledge
must
be
dependent
upon
metaphysics
in
fact
each
of
these
two
lines
of
thought
leads
to
the
other
they
form
a
circle
and
there
can
be
no
other
centre
to
the
circle
but
the
empirical
study
of
evolution
it
is
only
in
seeing
consciousness
run
through
matter
lose
itself
there
and
find
itself
there
again
divide
and
reconstitute
itself
that
we
shall
form
an
idea
of
the
mutual
opposition
of
the
two
terms
as
also
perhaps
of
their
common
origin
but
on
the
other
hand
by
dwelling
on
this
opposition
of
the
two
elements
and
on
this
identity
of
origin
perhaps
we
shall
bring
out
more
clearly
the
meaning
of
evolution
itself
such
will
be
the
aim
of
our
next
chapter
but
the
facts
that
we
have
just
noticed
must
have
already
suggested
to
us
the
idea
that
life
is
connected
either
with
consciousness
or
with
something
that
resembles
it
throughout
the
whole
extent
of
the
animal
kingdom
we
have
said
consciousness
seems
proportionate
to
the
living
being
power
of
choice
it
lights
up
the
zone
of
potentialities
that
surrounds
the
act
it
fills
the
interval
between
what
is
done
and
what
might
be
done
looked
at
from
without
we
may
regard
it
as
a
simple
aid
to
action
a
light
that
action
kindles
a
momentary
spark
flying
up
from
the
friction
of
real
action
against
possible
actions
but
we
must
also
point
out
that
things
would
go
on
in
just
the
same
way
if
consciousness
instead
of
being
the
effect
were
the
cause
we
might
suppose
that
consciousness
even
in
the
most
rudimentary
animal
covers
by
right
an
enormous
field
but
is
compressed
in
fact
in
a
kind
of
vise
each
advance
of
the
nervous
centres
by
giving
the
organism
a
choice
between
a
larger
number
of
actions
calls
forth
the
potentialities
that
are
capable
of
surrounding
the
real
thus
opening
the
vise
wider
and
allowing
consciousness
to
pass
more
freely
in
this
second
hypothesis
as
in
the
first
consciousness
is
still
the
instrument
of
action
but
it
is
even
more
true
to
say
that
action
is
the
instrument
of
consciousness
for
the
complicating
of
action
with
action
and
the
opposing
of
action
to
action
are
for
the
imprisoned
consciousness
the
only
possible
means
to
set
itself
free
how
then
shall
we
choose
between
the
two
hypotheses
if
the
first
is
true
consciousness
must
express
exactly
at
each
instant
the
state
of
the
brain
there
is
strict
parallelism
so
far
as
intelligible
between
the
psychical
and
the
cerebral
state
on
the
second
hypothesis
on
the
contrary
there
is
indeed
solidarity
and
interdependence
between
the
brain
and
consciousness
but
not
parallelism
the
more
complicated
the
brain
becomes
thus
giving
the
organism
greater
choice
of
possible
actions
the
more
does
consciousness
outrun
its
physical
concomitant
thus
the
recollection
of
the
same
spectacle
probably
modifies
in
the
same
way
a
dog
brain
and
a
man
brain
if
the
perception
has
been
the
same
yet
the
recollection
must
be
very
different
in
the
consciousness
from
what
it
is
in
the
dog
in
the
dog
the
recollection
remains
the
captive
of
perception
it
is
brought
back
to
consciousness
only
when
an
analogous
perception
recalls
it
by
reproducing
the
same
spectacle
and
then
it
is
manifested
by
the
recognition
rather
than
of
the
present
perception
much
more
than
by
an
actual
reappearance
of
the
recollection
itself
man
on
the
contrary
is
capable
of
calling
up
the
recollection
at
will
at
any
moment
independently
of
the
present
perception
he
is
not
limited
to
his
past
life
again
he
and
it
the
local
modification
of
the
brain
to
which
the
recollection
is
attached
being
the
same
in
each
case
the
psychological
difference
between
the
two
recollections
can
not
have
its
ground
in
a
particular
difference
of
detail
between
the
two
cerebral
mechanisms
but
in
the
difference
between
the
two
brains
taken
each
as
a
whole
the
more
complex
of
the
two
in
putting
a
greater
number
of
mechanisms
in
opposition
to
one
another
has
enabled
consciousness
to
disengage
itself
from
the
restraint
of
one
and
all
and
to
reach
independence
that
things
do
happen
in
this
way
that
the
second
of
the
two
hypotheses
is
that
which
must
be
chosen
is
what
we
have
tried
to
prove
in
a
former
work
by
the
study
of
facts
that
best
bring
into
relief
the
relation
of
the
conscious
state
to
the
cerebral
state
the
facts
of
normal
and
pathological
recognition
in
particular
the
forms
of
aphasia
but
it
could
have
been
proved
by
pure
reasoning
before
even
it
was
evidenced
by
facts
we
have
shown
on
what
postulate
on
what
confusion
of
two
mutually
incompatible
symbolisms
the
hypothesis
of
equivalence
between
the
cerebral
state
and
the
psychic
state
rests
the
evolution
of
life
looked
at
from
this
point
receives
a
clearer
meaning
although
it
can
not
be
subsumed
under
any
actual
it
is
as
if
a
broad
current
of
consciousness
had
penetrated
matter
loaded
as
all
consciousness
is
with
an
enormous
multiplicity
of
interwoven
potentialities
it
has
carried
matter
along
to
organization
but
its
movement
has
been
at
once
infinitely
retarded
and
infinitely
divided
on
the
one
hand
indeed
consciousness
has
had
to
fall
asleep
like
the
chrysalis
in
the
envelope
in
which
it
is
preparing
for
itself
wings
and
on
the
other
hand
the
manifold
tendencies
it
contained
have
been
distributed
among
divergent
series
of
organisms
which
moreover
express
these
tendencies
outwardly
in
movements
rather
than
internally
in
representations
in
the
course
of
this
evolution
while
some
beings
have
fallen
more
and
more
asleep
others
have
more
and
more
completely
awakened
and
the
torpor
of
some
has
served
the
activity
of
others
but
the
waking
could
be
effected
in
two
different
ways
life
that
is
to
say
consciousness
launched
into
matter
fixed
its
attention
either
on
its
own
movement
or
on
the
matter
it
was
passing
through
and
it
has
thus
been
turned
either
in
the
direction
of
intuition
or
in
that
of
intellect
intuition
at
first
sight
seems
far
preferable
to
intellect
since
in
it
life
and
consciousness
remain
within
themselves
but
a
glance
at
the
evolution
of
living
beings
shows
us
that
intuition
could
not
go
very
far
on
the
side
of
intuition
consciousness
found
itself
so
restricted
by
its
envelope
that
intuition
had
to
shrink
into
instinct
that
is
to
embrace
only
the
very
small
portion
of
life
that
interested
it
and
this
it
embraces
only
in
the
dark
touching
it
while
hardly
seeing
it
on
this
side
the
horizon
was
soon
shut
out
on
the
contrary
consciousness
in
shaping
itself
into
intelligence
that
is
to
say
in
concentrating
itself
at
first
on
matter
seems
to
externalize
itself
in
relation
to
itself
but
just
because
it
adapts
itself
thereby
to
objects
from
without
it
succeeds
in
moving
among
them
and
in
evading
the
barriers
they
oppose
to
it
thus
opening
to
itself
an
unlimited
field
once
freed
moreover
it
can
turn
inwards
on
itself
and
awaken
the
potentialities
of
intuition
which
still
slumber
within
it
from
this
point
of
view
not
only
does
consciousness
appear
as
the
motive
principle
of
evolution
but
also
among
conscious
beings
themselves
man
comes
to
occupy
a
privileged
place
between
him
and
the
animals
the
difference
is
no
longer
one
of
degree
but
of
kind
we
shall
show
how
this
conclusion
is
arrived
at
in
our
next
chapter
let
us
now
show
how
the
preceding
analyses
suggest
it
a
noteworthy
fact
is
the
extraordinary
disproportion
between
the
consequences
of
an
invention
and
the
invention
itself
we
have
said
that
intelligence
is
modeled
on
matter
and
that
it
aims
in
the
first
place
at
fabrication
but
does
it
fabricate
in
order
to
fabricate
or
does
it
not
pursue
involuntarily
and
even
unconsciously
something
entirely
different
fabricating
consists
in
shaping
matter
in
making
it
supple
and
in
bending
it
in
converting
it
into
an
instrument
in
order
to
become
master
of
it
it
is
this
that
profits
humanity
much
more
even
than
the
material
result
of
the
invention
itself
though
we
derive
an
immediate
advantage
from
the
thing
made
as
an
intelligent
animal
might
do
and
though
this
advantage
be
all
the
inventor
sought
it
is
a
slight
matter
compared
with
the
new
ideas
and
new
feelings
that
the
invention
may
give
rise
to
in
every
direction
as
if
the
essential
part
of
the
effect
were
to
raise
us
above
ourselves
and
enlarge
our
horizon
between
the
effect
and
the
cause
the
disproportion
is
so
great
that
it
is
difficult
to
regard
the
cause
as
of
its
effect
it
releases
it
whilst
settling
indeed
its
direction
everything
happens
as
though
the
grip
of
intelligence
on
matter
were
in
its
main
intention
to
something
that
matter
is
holding
back
the
same
impression
arises
when
we
compare
the
brain
of
man
with
that
of
the
animals
the
difference
at
first
appears
to
be
only
a
difference
of
size
and
complexity
but
judging
by
function
there
must
be
something
else
besides
in
the
animal
the
motor
mechanisms
that
the
brain
succeeds
in
setting
up
or
in
other
words
the
habits
contracted
voluntarily
have
no
other
object
nor
effect
than
the
accomplishment
of
the
movements
marked
out
in
these
habits
stored
in
these
mechanisms
but
in
man
the
motor
habit
may
have
a
second
result
out
of
proportion
to
the
first
it
can
hold
other
motor
habits
in
check
and
thereby
in
overcoming
automatism
set
consciousness
free
we
know
what
vast
regions
in
the
human
brain
language
occupies
the
cerebral
mechanisms
that
correspond
to
the
words
have
this
in
particular
that
they
can
be
made
to
grapple
with
other
mechanisms
those
for
instance
that
correspond
to
the
things
themselves
or
even
be
made
to
grapple
with
one
another
meanwhile
consciousness
which
would
have
been
dragged
down
and
drowned
in
the
accomplishment
of
the
act
is
restored
and
set
free
the
difference
must
therefore
be
more
radical
than
a
superficial
examination
would
lead
us
to
suppose
it
is
the
difference
between
a
mechanism
which
engages
the
attention
and
a
mechanism
from
which
it
can
be
diverted
the
primitive
as
newcomen
conceived
it
required
the
presence
of
a
person
exclusively
employed
to
turn
on
and
off
the
taps
either
to
let
the
steam
into
the
cylinder
or
to
throw
the
cold
spray
into
it
in
order
to
condense
the
steam
it
is
said
that
a
boy
employed
on
this
work
and
very
tired
of
having
to
do
it
got
the
idea
of
tying
the
handles
of
the
taps
with
cords
to
the
beam
of
the
engine
then
the
machine
opened
and
closed
the
taps
itself
it
worked
all
alone
now
if
an
observer
had
compared
the
structure
of
this
second
machine
with
that
of
the
first
without
taking
into
account
the
two
boys
left
to
watch
over
them
he
would
have
found
only
a
slight
difference
of
complexity
that
is
indeed
all
we
can
perceive
when
we
look
only
at
the
machines
but
if
we
cast
a
glance
at
the
two
boys
we
shall
see
that
whilst
one
is
wholly
taken
up
by
the
watching
the
other
is
free
to
go
and
play
as
he
chooses
and
that
from
this
point
of
view
the
difference
between
the
two
machines
is
radical
the
first
holding
the
attention
captive
the
second
setting
it
at
liberty
a
difference
of
the
same
kind
we
think
would
be
found
between
the
brain
of
an
animal
and
the
human
brain
if
now
we
should
wish
to
express
this
in
terms
of
finality
we
should
have
to
say
that
consciousness
after
having
been
obliged
in
order
to
set
itself
free
to
divide
organization
into
two
complementary
parts
vegetables
on
one
hand
and
animals
on
the
other
has
sought
an
issue
in
the
double
direction
of
instinct
and
of
intelligence
it
has
not
found
it
with
instinct
and
it
has
not
obtained
it
on
the
side
of
intelligence
except
by
a
sudden
leap
from
the
animal
to
man
so
that
in
the
last
analysis
man
might
be
considered
the
reason
for
the
existence
of
the
entire
organization
of
life
on
our
planet
but
this
would
be
only
a
manner
of
speaking
there
is
in
reality
only
a
current
of
existence
and
the
opposing
current
thence
proceeds
the
whole
evolution
of
life
we
must
now
grasp
more
closely
the
opposition
of
these
two
currents
perhaps
we
shall
thus
discover
for
them
a
common
source
by
this
we
shall
also
no
doubt
penetrate
the
most
obscure
regions
of
metaphysics
however
as
the
two
directions
we
have
to
follow
are
clearly
marked
in
intelligence
on
the
one
hand
in
instinct
and
intuition
on
the
other
we
are
not
afraid
of
straying
a
survey
of
the
evolution
of
life
suggests
to
us
a
certain
conception
of
knowledge
and
also
a
certain
metaphysics
which
imply
each
other
once
made
clear
this
metaphysics
and
this
critique
may
throw
some
light
in
their
turn

evolution

on
the
meaning
of
life
the
order
of
nature
and
the
form
of
intelligence
in
the
course
of
our
first
chapter
we
traced
a
line
of
demarcation
between
the
inorganic
and
the
organized
but
we
pointed
out
that
the
division
of
unorganized
matter
into
separate
bodies
is
relative
to
our
senses
and
to
our
intellect
and
that
matter
looked
at
as
an
undivided
whole
must
be
a
flux
rather
than
a
thing
in
this
we
were
preparing
the
way
for
a
reconciliation
between
the
inert
and
the
living
on
the
other
side
we
have
shown
in
our
second
chapter
that
the
same
opposition
is
found
again
between
instinct
and
intelligence
the
one
turned
to
certain
determinations
of
life
the
other
molded
on
the
configuration
of
matter
but
instinct
and
intelligence
we
have
also
said
stand
out
from
the
same
background
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
we
may
call
consciousness
in
general
and
which
must
be
coextensive
with
universal
life
in
this
way
we
have
disclosed
the
possibility
of
showing
the
genesis
of
intelligence
in
setting
out
from
general
consciousness
which
embraces
it
we
are
now
then
to
attempt
a
genesis
of
intellect
at
the
same
time
as
a
genesis
of
material
bodies
two
enterprises
that
are
evidently
correlative
if
it
be
true
that
the
main
lines
of
our
intellect
mark
out
the
general
form
of
our
action
on
matter
and
that
the
detail
of
matter
is
ruled
by
the
requirements
of
our
action
intellectuality
and
materiality
have
been
constituted
in
detail
by
reciprocal
adaptation
both
are
derived
from
a
wider
and
higher
form
of
existence
it
is
there
that
we
must
replace
them
in
order
to
see
them
issue
forth
such
an
attempt
may
appear
at
first
more
daring
than
the
boldest
speculations
of
metaphysicians
it
claims
to
go
further
than
psychology
further
than
cosmology
further
than
traditional
metaphysics
for
psychology
cosmology
and
metaphysics
take
intelligence
in
all
that
is
essential
to
it
as
given
instead
of
as
we
now
propose
engendering
it
in
its
form
and
in
its
matter
the
enterprise
is
in
reality
much
more
modest
as
we
are
going
to
show
but
let
us
first
say
how
it
differs
from
others
to
begin
with
psychology
we
are
not
to
believe
that
it
intelligence
when
it
follows
the
progressive
development
of
it
through
the
animal
series
comparative
psychology
teaches
us
that
the
more
an
animal
is
intelligent
the
more
it
tends
to
reflect
on
the
actions
by
which
it
makes
use
of
things
and
thus
to
approximate
to
man
but
its
actions
have
already
by
themselves
adopted
the
principal
lines
of
human
action
they
have
made
out
the
same
general
directions
in
the
material
world
as
we
have
they
depend
upon
the
same
objects
bound
together
by
the
same
relations
so
that
animal
intelligence
although
it
does
not
form
concepts
properly
so
called
already
moves
in
a
conceptual
atmosphere
absorbed
at
every
instant
by
the
actions
it
performs
and
the
attitudes
it
must
adopt
drawn
outward
by
them
and
so
externalized
in
relation
to
itself
it
no
doubt
plays
rather
than
thinks
its
ideas
this
play
none
the
less
already
corresponds
in
the
main
to
the
general
plan
of
human
intelligence
to
explain
the
intelligence
of
man
by
that
of
the
animal
consists
then
simply
in
following
the
development
of
an
embryo
of
humanity
into
complete
humanity
we
show
how
a
certain
direction
has
been
followed
further
and
further
by
beings
more
and
more
intelligent
but
the
moment
we
admit
the
direction
intelligence
is
given
in
a
cosmogony
like
that
of
spencer
intelligence
is
taken
for
granted
as
matter
also
at
the
same
time
we
are
shown
matter
obeying
laws
objects
connected
with
objects
and
facts
with
facts
by
constant
relations
consciousness
receiving
the
imprint
of
these
relations
and
laws
and
thus
adopting
the
general
configuration
of
nature
and
shaping
itself
into
intellect
but
how
can
we
fail
to
see
that
intelligence
is
supposed
when
we
admit
objects
and
facts
and
apart
from
any
hypothesis
on
the
nature
of
the
matter
it
is
evident
that
the
materiality
of
a
body
does
not
stop
at
the
point
at
which
we
touch
it
a
body
is
present
wherever
its
influence
is
felt
its
attractive
force
to
speak
only
of
that
is
exerted
on
the
sun
on
the
planets
perhaps
on
the
entire
universe
the
more
physics
advances
the
more
it
effaces
the
individuality
of
bodies
and
even
of
the
particles
into
which
the
scientific
imagination
began
by
decomposing
them
bodies
and
corpuscles
tend
to
dissolve
into
a
universal
interaction
our
perceptions
give
us
the
plan
of
our
eventual
action
on
things
much
more
than
that
of
things
themselves
the
outlines
we
find
in
objects
simply
mark
what
we
can
attain
and
modify
in
them
the
lines
we
see
traced
through
matter
are
just
the
paths
on
which
we
are
called
to
move
outlines
and
paths
have
declared
themselves
in
the
measure
and
proportion
that
consciousness
has
prepared
for
action
on
unorganized
matter
that
is
to
say
in
the
measure
and
proportion
that
intelligence
has
been
formed
it
is
doubtful
whether
animals
built
on
a
different
plan
a
mollusc
or
an
insect
for
instance
cut
matter
up
along
the
same
articulations
it
is
not
indeed
necessary
that
they
should
separate
it
into
bodies
at
all
in
order
to
follow
the
indications
of
instinct
there
is
no
need
to
perceive
it
is
enough
to
distinguish
intelligence
on
the
contrary
even
in
its
humblest
form
already
aims
at
getting
matter
to
act
on
matter
if
on
one
side
matter
lends
itself
to
a
division
into
active
and
passive
bodies
or
more
simply
into
coexistent
and
distinct
fragments
it
is
from
this
side
that
intelligence
will
regard
it
and
the
more
it
busies
itself
with
dividing
the
more
it
will
spread
out
in
space
in
the
form
of
extension
adjoining
extension
a
matter
that
undoubtedly
itself
has
a
tendency
to
spatiality
but
whose
parts
are
yet
in
a
state
of
reciprocal
implication
and
interpenetration
thus
the
same
movement
by
which
the
mind
is
brought
to
form
itself
into
intellect
that
is
to
say
into
distinct
concepts
brings
matter
to
break
itself
up
into
objects
excluding
one
another
more
consciousness
is
intellectualized
the
more
is
matter
so
that
the
evolutionist
philosophy
when
it
imagines
in
space
a
matter
cut
up
on
the
very
lines
that
our
action
will
follow
has
given
itself
in
advance
ready
made
the
intelligence
of
which
it
claims
to
show
the
genesis
metaphysics
applies
itself
to
a
work
of
the
same
kind
though
subtler
and
more
when
it
deduces
the
categories
of
thought
it
compresses
intellect
reduces
it
to
its
quintessence
holds
it
tight
in
a
principle
so
simple
that
it
can
be
thought
empty
from
this
principle
we
then
draw
out
what
we
have
virtually
put
into
it
in
this
way
we
may
no
doubt
show
the
coherence
of
intelligence
define
intellect
give
its
formula
but
we
do
not
trace
its
genesis
an
enterprise
like
that
of
fichte
although
more
philosophical
than
that
of
spencer
in
that
it
pays
more
respect
to
the
true
order
of
things
hardly
leads
us
any
further
fichte
takes
thought
in
a
concentrated
state
and
expands
it
into
reality
spencer
starts
from
external
reality
and
condenses
it
into
intellect
but
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
the
intellect
must
be
taken
at
the
beginning
as
given
either
condensed
or
expanded
grasped
in
itself
by
a
direct
vision
or
perceived
by
reflection
in
nature
as
in
a
mirror
the
agreement
of
most
philosophers
on
this
point
comes
from
the
fact
that
they
are
at
one
in
affirming
the
unity
of
nature
and
in
representing
this
unity
under
an
abstract
and
geometrical
form
between
the
organized
and
the
unorganized
they
do
not
see
and
they
will
not
see
the
cleft
some
start
from
the
inorganic
and
by
compounding
it
with
itself
claim
to
form
the
living
others
place
life
first
and
proceed
towards
matter
by
a
skilfully
managed
but
for
both
there
are
only
differences
of
in
nature
degrees
of
complexity
in
the
first
hypothesis
of
intensity
in
the
second
once
this
principle
is
admitted
intelligence
becomes
as
vast
as
reality
for
it
is
unquestionable
that
whatever
is
geometrical
in
things
is
entirely
accessible
to
human
intelligence
and
if
the
continuity
between
geometry
and
the
rest
is
perfect
all
the
rest
must
indeed
be
equally
intelligible
equally
intelligent
such
is
the
postulate
of
most
systems
any
one
can
easily
be
convinced
of
this
by
comparing
doctrines
that
seem
to
have
no
common
point
no
common
measure
those
of
fichte
and
spencer
for
instance
two
names
that
we
happen
to
have
just
brought
together
at
the
root
of
these
speculations
then
there
are
the
two
convictions
correlative
and
complementary
that
nature
is
one
and
that
the
function
of
intellect
is
to
embrace
it
in
its
entirety
the
faculty
of
knowing
being
supposed
coextensive
with
the
whole
of
experience
there
can
no
longer
be
any
question
of
engendering
it
it
is
already
given
and
we
merely
have
to
use
it
as
we
use
our
sight
to
take
in
the
horizon
it
is
true
that
opinions
differ
as
to
the
value
of
the
result
for
some
it
is
reality
itself
that
the
intellect
embraces
for
others
it
is
only
a
phantom
but
phantom
or
reality
what
intelligence
grasps
is
thought
to
be
all
that
can
be
attained
hence
the
exaggerated
confidence
of
philosophy
in
the
powers
of
the
individual
mind
whether
it
is
dogmatic
or
critical
whether
it
admits
the
relativity
of
our
knowledge
or
claims
to
be
established
within
the
absolute
a
philosophy
is
generally
the
work
of
a
philosopher
a
single
and
unitary
vision
of
the
whole
it
is
to
be
taken
or
left
more
modest
and
also
alone
capable
of
being
completed
and
perfected
is
the
philosophy
we
advocate
human
intelligence
as
we
represent
it
is
not
at
all
what
plato
taught
in
the
allegory
of
the
cave
its
function
is
not
to
look
at
passing
shadows
nor
yet
to
turn
itself
round
and
contemplate
the
glaring
sun
it
has
something
else
to
do
harnessed
like
yoked
oxen
to
a
heavy
task
we
feel
the
play
of
our
muscles
and
joints
the
weight
of
the
plow
and
the
resistance
of
the
soil
to
act
and
to
know
that
we
are
acting
to
come
into
touch
with
reality
and
even
to
live
it
but
only
in
the
measure
in
which
it
concerns
the
work
that
is
being
accomplished
and
the
furrow
that
is
being
plowed
such
is
the
function
of
human
intelligence
yet
a
beneficent
fluid
bathes
us
whence
we
draw
the
very
force
to
labor
and
to
live
from
this
ocean
of
life
in
which
we
are
immersed
we
are
continually
drawing
something
and
we
feel
that
our
being
or
at
least
the
intellect
that
guides
it
has
been
formed
therein
by
a
kind
of
local
concentration
philosophy
can
only
be
an
effort
to
dissolve
again
into
the
whole
intelligence
reabsorbed
into
its
principle
may
thus
live
back
again
its
own
genesis
but
the
enterprise
can
not
be
achieved
in
one
stroke
it
is
necessarily
collective
and
progressive
it
consists
in
an
interchange
of
impressions
which
correcting
and
adding
to
each
other
will
end
by
expanding
the
humanity
in
us
and
making
us
even
transcend
it
but
this
method
has
against
it
the
most
inveterate
habits
of
the
mind
it
at
once
suggests
the
idea
of
a
vicious
circle
in
vain
we
shall
be
told
you
claim
to
go
beyond
intelligence
how
can
you
do
that
except
by
intelligence
all
that
is
clear
in
your
consciousness
is
intelligence
you
are
inside
your
own
thought
you
can
not
get
out
of
it
say
if
you
like
that
the
intellect
is
capable
of
progress
that
it
will
see
more
and
more
clearly
into
a
greater
and
greater
number
of
things
but
do
not
speak
of
engendering
it
for
it
is
with
your
intellect
itself
that
you
would
have
to
do
the
work
the
objection
presents
itself
naturally
to
the
mind
but
the
same
reasoning
would
prove
also
the
impossibility
of
acquiring
any
new
habit
it
is
of
the
essence
of
reasoning
to
shut
us
up
in
the
circle
of
the
given
but
action
breaks
the
circle
if
we
had
never
seen
a
man
swim
we
might
say
that
swimming
is
an
impossible
thing
inasmuch
as
to
learn
to
swim
we
must
begin
by
holding
ourselves
up
in
the
water
and
consequently
already
know
how
to
swim
reasoning
in
fact
always
nails
us
down
to
the
solid
ground
but
if
quite
simply
i
throw
myself
into
the
water
without
fear
i
may
keep
myself
up
well
enough
at
first
by
merely
struggling
and
gradually
adapt
myself
to
the
new
environment
i
shall
thus
have
learnt
to
swim
so
in
theory
there
is
a
kind
of
absurdity
in
trying
to
know
otherwise
than
by
intelligence
but
if
the
risk
be
frankly
accepted
action
will
perhaps
cut
the
knot
that
reasoning
has
tied
and
will
not
unloose
besides
the
risk
will
appear
to
grow
less
the
more
our
point
of
view
is
adopted
we
have
shown
that
intellect
has
detached
itself
from
a
vastly
wider
reality
but
that
there
has
never
been
a
clean
cut
between
the
two
all
around
conceptual
thought
there
remains
an
indistinct
fringe
which
recalls
its
origin
and
further
we
compared
the
intellect
to
a
solid
nucleus
formed
by
means
of
condensation
this
nucleus
does
not
differ
radically
from
the
fluid
surrounding
it
it
can
only
be
reabsorbed
in
it
because
it
is
made
of
the
same
substance
he
who
throws
himself
into
the
water
having
known
only
the
resistance
of
the
solid
earth
will
immediately
be
drowned
if
he
does
not
struggle
against
the
fluidity
of
the
new
environment
he
must
perforce
still
cling
to
that
solidity
so
to
speak
which
even
water
presents
only
on
this
condition
can
he
get
used
to
the
fluid
fluidity
so
of
our
thought
when
it
has
decided
to
make
the
leap
but
leap
it
must
that
is
leave
its
own
environment
reason
reasoning
on
its
powers
will
never
succeed
in
extending
them
though
the
extension
would
not
appear
at
all
unreasonable
once
it
were
accomplished
thousands
and
thousands
of
variations
on
the
theme
of
walking
will
never
yield
a
rule
for
swimming
come
enter
the
water
and
when
you
know
how
to
swim
you
will
understand
how
the
mechanism
of
swimming
is
connected
with
that
of
walking
swimming
is
an
extension
of
walking
but
walking
would
never
have
pushed
you
on
to
swimming
so
you
may
speculate
as
intelligently
as
you
will
on
the
mechanism
of
intelligence
you
will
never
by
this
method
succeed
in
going
beyond
it
you
may
get
something
more
complex
but
not
something
higher
nor
even
something
different
you
must
take
things
by
storm
you
must
thrust
intelligence
outside
itself
by
an
act
of
will
so
the
vicious
circle
is
only
apparent
it
is
on
the
contrary
real
we
think
in
every
other
method
of
philosophy
this
we
must
try
to
show
in
a
few
words
if
only
to
prove
that
philosophy
can
not
and
must
not
accept
the
relation
established
by
pure
intellectualism
between
the
theory
of
knowledge
and
the
theory
of
the
known
between
metaphysics
and
science
at
first
sight
it
may
seem
prudent
to
leave
the
consideration
of
facts
to
positive
science
to
let
physics
and
chemistry
busy
themselves
with
matter
the
biological
and
psychological
sciences
with
life
the
task
of
the
philosopher
is
then
clearly
defined
he
takes
facts
and
laws
from
the
scientists
hand
and
whether
he
tries
to
go
beyond
them
in
order
to
reach
their
deeper
causes
or
whether
he
thinks
it
impossible
to
go
further
and
even
proves
it
by
the
analysis
of
scientific
knowledge
in
both
cases
he
has
for
the
facts
and
relations
handed
over
by
science
the
sort
of
respect
that
is
due
to
a
final
verdict
to
this
knowledge
he
adds
a
critique
of
the
faculty
of
knowing
and
also
if
he
thinks
proper
a
metaphysic
but
the
of
knowledge
he
regards
as
the
affair
of
science
and
not
of
philosophy
but
how
does
he
fail
to
see
that
the
real
result
of
this
division
of
labor
is
to
mix
up
everything
and
confuse
everything
the
metaphysic
or
the
critique
that
the
philosopher
has
reserved
for
himself
he
has
to
receive
from
positive
science
it
being
already
contained
in
the
descriptions
and
analyses
the
whole
care
of
which
he
left
to
the
scientists
for
not
having
wished
to
intervene
at
the
beginning
in
questions
of
fact
he
finds
himself
reduced
in
questions
of
principle
to
formulating
purely
and
simply
in
more
precise
terms
the
unconscious
and
consequently
inconsistent
metaphysic
and
critique
which
the
very
attitude
of
science
to
reality
marks
out
let
us
not
be
deceived
by
an
apparent
analogy
between
natural
things
and
human
things
here
we
are
not
in
the
judiciary
domain
where
the
description
of
fact
and
the
judgment
on
the
fact
are
two
distinct
things
distinct
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
above
the
fact
and
independent
of
it
there
is
a
law
promulgated
by
a
legislator
here
the
laws
are
internal
to
the
facts
and
relative
to
the
lines
that
have
been
followed
in
cutting
the
real
into
distinct
facts
we
can
not
describe
the
outward
appearance
of
the
object
without
prejudging
its
inner
nature
and
its
organization
form
is
no
longer
entirely
isolable
from
matter
and
he
who
has
begun
by
reserving
to
philosophy
questions
of
principle
and
who
has
thereby
tried
to
put
philosophy
above
the
sciences
as
a
court
of
cassation
is
above
the
courts
of
assizes
and
of
appeal
will
gradually
come
to
make
no
more
of
philosophy
than
a
registration
court
charged
at
most
with
wording
more
precisely
the
sentences
that
are
brought
to
it
pronounced
and
irrevocable
positive
science
is
in
fact
a
work
of
pure
intellect
now
whether
our
conception
of
the
intellect
be
accepted
or
rejected
there
is
one
point
on
which
everybody
will
agree
with
us
and
that
is
that
the
intellect
is
at
home
in
the
presence
of
unorganized
matter
this
matter
it
makes
use
of
more
and
more
by
mechanical
inventions
and
mechanical
inventions
become
the
easier
to
it
the
more
it
thinks
matter
as
mechanism
the
intellect
bears
within
itself
in
the
form
of
natural
logic
a
latent
geometrism
that
is
set
free
in
the
measure
and
proportion
that
the
intellect
penetrates
into
the
inner
nature
of
inert
matter
intelligence
is
in
tune
with
this
matter
and
that
is
why
the
physics
and
metaphysics
of
inert
matter
are
so
near
each
other
now
when
the
intellect
undertakes
the
study
of
life
it
necessarily
treats
the
living
like
the
inert
applying
the
same
forms
to
this
new
object
carrying
over
into
this
new
field
the
same
habits
that
have
succeeded
so
well
in
the
old
and
it
is
right
to
do
so
for
only
on
such
terms
does
the
living
offer
to
our
action
the
same
hold
as
inert
matter
but
the
truth
we
thus
arrive
at
becomes
altogether
relative
to
our
faculty
of
action
it
is
no
more
than
a
verity
it
can
not
have
the
same
value
as
the
physical
verity
being
only
an
extension
of
physics
to
an
object
which
we
are
agreed
to
look
at
only
in
its
external
aspect
the
duty
of
philosophy
should
be
to
intervene
here
actively
to
examine
the
living
without
any
reservation
as
to
practical
utility
by
freeing
itself
from
forms
and
habits
that
are
strictly
intellectual
its
own
special
object
is
to
speculate
that
is
to
say
to
see
its
attitude
toward
the
living
should
not
be
that
of
science
which
aims
only
at
action
and
which
being
able
to
act
only
by
means
of
inert
matter
presents
to
itself
the
rest
of
reality
in
this
single
respect
what
must
the
result
be
if
it
leave
biological
and
psychological
facts
to
positive
science
alone
as
it
has
left
and
rightly
left
physical
facts
it
will
accept
a
mechanistic
conception
of
all
nature
a
conception
unreflected
and
even
unconscious
the
outcome
of
the
material
need
it
will
accept
the
doctrine
of
the
simple
unity
of
knowledge
and
of
the
abstract
unity
of
nature
the
moment
it
does
so
its
fate
is
sealed
the
philosopher
has
no
longer
any
choice
save
between
a
metaphysical
dogmatism
and
a
metaphysical
skepticism
both
of
which
rest
at
bottom
on
the
same
postulate
and
neither
of
which
adds
anything
to
positive
science
he
may
hypostasize
the
unity
of
nature
or
what
comes
to
the
same
thing
the
unity
of
science
in
a
being
who
is
nothing
since
he
does
nothing
an
ineffectual
god
who
simply
sums
up
in
himself
all
the
given
or
in
an
eternal
matter
from
whose
womb
have
been
poured
out
the
properties
of
things
and
the
laws
of
nature
or
again
in
a
pure
form
which
endeavors
to
seize
an
unseizable
multiplicity
and
which
is
as
we
will
the
form
of
nature
or
the
form
of
thought
all
these
philosophies
tell
us
in
their
different
languages
that
science
is
right
to
treat
the
living
as
the
inert
and
that
there
is
no
difference
of
value
no
distinction
to
be
made
between
the
results
which
intellect
arrives
at
in
applying
its
categories
whether
it
rests
on
inert
matter
or
attacks
life
in
many
cases
however
we
feel
the
frame
cracking
but
as
we
did
not
begin
by
distinguishing
between
the
inert
and
the
living
the
one
adapted
in
advance
to
the
frame
in
which
we
insert
it
the
other
incapable
of
being
held
in
the
frame
otherwise
than
by
a
convention
which
eliminates
from
it
all
that
is
essential
we
find
ourselves
in
the
end
reduced
to
regarding
everything
the
frame
contains
with
equal
suspicion
to
a
metaphysical
dogmatism
which
has
erected
into
an
absolute
the
factitious
unity
of
science
there
succeeds
a
skepticism
or
a
relativism
that
universalizes
and
extends
to
all
the
results
of
science
the
artificial
character
of
some
among
them
so
philosophy
swings
to
and
fro
between
the
doctrine
that
regards
absolute
reality
as
unknowable
and
that
which
in
the
idea
it
gives
us
of
this
reality
says
nothing
more
than
science
has
said
for
having
wished
to
prevent
all
conflict
between
science
and
philosophy
we
have
sacrificed
philosophy
without
any
appreciable
gain
to
science
and
for
having
tried
to
avoid
the
seeming
vicious
circle
which
consists
in
using
the
intellect
to
transcend
the
intellect
we
find
ourselves
turning
in
a
real
circle
that
which
consists
in
laboriously
rediscovering
by
metaphysics
a
unity
that
we
began
by
positing
a
unity
that
we
admitted
blindly
and
unconsciously
by
the
very
act
of
abandoning
the
whole
of
experience
to
science
and
the
whole
of
reality
to
the
pure
understanding
let
us
begin
on
the
contrary
by
tracing
a
line
of
demarcation
between
the
inert
and
the
living
we
shall
find
that
the
inert
enters
naturally
into
the
frames
of
the
intellect
but
that
the
living
is
adapted
to
these
frames
only
artificially
so
that
we
must
adopt
a
special
attitude
towards
it
and
examine
it
with
other
eyes
than
those
of
positive
science
philosophy
then
invades
the
domain
of
experience
she
busies
herself
with
many
things
which
hitherto
have
not
concerned
her
science
theory
of
knowledge
and
metaphysics
find
themselves
on
the
same
ground
at
first
there
may
be
a
certain
confusion
all
three
may
think
they
have
lost
something
but
all
three
will
profit
from
the
meeting
positive
science
indeed
may
pride
itself
on
the
uniform
value
attributed
to
its
affirmations
in
the
whole
field
of
experience
but
if
they
are
all
placed
on
the
same
footing
they
are
all
tainted
with
the
same
relativity
it
is
not
so
if
we
begin
by
making
the
distinction
which
in
our
view
is
forced
upon
us
the
understanding
is
at
home
in
the
domain
of
unorganized
matter
on
this
matter
human
action
is
naturally
exercised
and
action
as
we
said
above
can
not
be
set
in
motion
in
the
unreal
thus
of
physics
so
long
as
we
are
considering
only
its
general
form
and
not
the
particular
cutting
out
of
matter
in
which
it
is
manifested
we
may
say
that
it
touches
the
absolute
on
the
contrary
it
is
by
accident
chance
or
convention
as
you
please
that
science
obtains
a
hold
on
the
living
analogous
to
the
hold
it
has
on
matter
here
the
use
of
conceptual
frames
is
no
longer
natural
i
do
not
wish
to
say
that
it
is
not
legitimate
in
the
scientific
meaning
of
the
term
if
science
is
to
extend
our
action
on
things
and
if
we
can
act
only
with
inert
matter
for
instrument
science
can
and
must
continue
to
treat
the
living
as
it
has
treated
the
inert
but
in
doing
so
it
must
be
understood
that
the
further
it
penetrates
the
depths
of
the
more
symbolic
the
more
relative
to
the
contingencies
of
action
the
knowledge
it
supplies
to
us
becomes
on
this
new
ground
philosophy
ought
then
to
follow
science
in
order
to
superpose
on
scientific
truth
a
knowledge
of
another
kind
which
may
be
called
metaphysical
thus
combined
all
our
knowledge
both
scientific
and
metaphysical
is
heightened
in
the
absolute
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
the
knowledge
we
possess
of
it
is
incomplete
no
doubt
but
not
external
or
relative
it
is
reality
itself
in
the
profoundest
meaning
of
the
word
that
we
reach
by
the
combined
and
progressive
development
of
science
and
of
philosophy
thus
in
renouncing
the
factitious
unity
which
the
understanding
imposes
on
nature
from
outside
we
shall
perhaps
find
its
true
inward
and
living
unity
for
the
effort
we
make
to
transcend
the
pure
understanding
introduces
us
into
that
more
vast
something
out
of
which
our
understanding
is
cut
and
from
which
it
has
detached
itself
and
as
matter
is
determined
by
intelligence
as
there
is
between
them
an
evident
agreement
we
can
not
make
the
genesis
of
the
one
without
making
the
genesis
of
the
other
an
identical
process
must
have
cut
out
matter
and
the
intellect
at
the
same
time
from
a
stuff
that
contained
both
into
this
reality
we
shall
get
back
more
and
more
completely
in
proportion
as
we
compel
ourselves
to
transcend
pure
intelligence
let
us
then
concentrate
attention
on
that
which
we
have
that
is
at
the
same
time
the
most
removed
from
externality
and
the
least
penetrated
with
intellectuality
let
us
seek
in
the
depths
of
our
experience
the
point
where
we
feel
ourselves
most
intimately
within
our
own
life
it
is
into
pure
duration
that
we
then
plunge
back
a
duration
in
which
the
past
always
moving
on
is
swelling
unceasingly
with
a
present
that
is
absolutely
new
but
at
the
same
time
we
feel
the
spring
of
our
will
strained
to
its
utmost
limit
we
must
by
a
strong
recoil
of
our
personality
on
itself
gather
up
our
past
which
is
slipping
away
in
order
to
thrust
it
compact
and
undivided
into
a
present
which
it
will
create
by
entering
rare
indeed
are
the
moments
when
we
are
to
this
extent
it
is
then
that
our
actions
are
truly
free
and
even
at
these
moments
we
do
not
completely
possess
ourselves
our
feeling
of
duration
i
should
say
the
actual
coinciding
of
ourself
with
itself
admits
of
degrees
but
the
more
the
feeling
is
deep
and
the
coincidence
complete
the
more
the
life
in
which
it
replaces
us
absorbs
intellectuality
by
transcending
it
for
the
natural
function
of
the
intellect
is
to
bind
like
to
like
and
it
is
only
facts
that
can
be
repeated
that
are
entirely
adaptable
to
intellectual
conceptions
now
our
intellect
does
undoubtedly
grasp
the
real
moments
of
real
duration
after
they
are
past
we
do
so
by
reconstituting
the
new
state
of
consciousness
out
of
a
series
of
views
taken
of
it
from
the
outside
each
of
which
resembles
as
much
as
possible
something
already
known
in
this
sense
we
may
say
that
the
state
of
consciousness
contains
intellectuality
implicitly
yet
the
state
of
consciousness
overflows
the
intellect
it
is
indeed
incommensurable
with
the
intellect
being
itself
indivisible
and
new
now
let
us
relax
the
strain
let
us
interrupt
the
effort
to
crowd
as
much
as
possible
of
the
past
into
the
present
if
the
relaxation
were
complete
there
would
no
longer
be
either
memory
or
will
which
amounts
to
saying
that
in
fact
we
never
do
fall
into
this
absolute
passivity
any
more
than
we
can
make
ourselves
absolutely
free
but
in
the
limit
we
get
a
glimpse
of
an
existence
made
of
a
present
which
recommences
unceasingly
devoid
of
real
duration
nothing
but
the
instantaneous
which
dies
and
is
born
again
endlessly
is
the
existence
of
matter
of
this
nature
not
altogether
for
analysis
resolves
it
into
elementary
vibrations
the
shortest
of
which
are
of
very
slight
duration
almost
vanishing
but
not
nothing
it
may
be
presumed
nevertheless
that
physical
existence
inclines
in
this
second
direction
as
psychical
existence
in
the
first
behind
spirituality
on
the
one
hand
and
materiality
with
intellectuality
on
the
other
there
are
then
two
processes
opposite
in
their
direction
and
we
pass
from
the
first
to
the
second
by
way
of
inversion
or
perhaps
even
by
simple
interruption
if
it
is
true
that
inversion
and
interruption
are
two
terms
which
in
this
case
must
be
held
to
be
synonymous
as
we
shall
show
at
more
length
later
on
this
presumption
is
confirmed
when
we
consider
things
from
the
point
of
view
of
extension
and
no
longer
from
that
of
duration
alone
the
more
we
succeed
in
making
ourselves
conscious
of
our
progress
in
pure
duration
the
more
we
feel
the
different
parts
of
our
being
enter
into
each
other
and
our
whole
personality
concentrate
itself
in
a
point
or
rather
a
sharp
edge
pressed
against
the
future
and
cutting
into
it
unceasingly
it
is
in
this
that
life
and
action
are
free
but
suppose
we
let
ourselves
go
and
instead
of
acting
dream
at
once
the
self
is
scattered
our
past
which
till
then
was
gathered
together
into
the
indivisible
impulsion
it
communicated
to
us
is
broken
up
into
a
thousand
recollections
made
external
to
one
another
they
give
up
interpenetrating
in
the
degree
that
they
become
fixed
our
personality
thus
descends
in
the
direction
of
space
it
coasts
around
it
continually
in
sensation
we
will
not
dwell
here
on
a
point
we
have
studied
elsewhere
let
us
merely
recall
that
extension
admits
of
degrees
that
all
sensation
is
extensive
in
a
certain
measure
and
that
the
idea
of
unextended
sensations
artificially
localized
in
space
is
a
mere
view
of
the
mind
suggested
by
an
unconscious
metaphysic
much
more
than
by
psychological
observation
no
doubt
we
make
only
the
first
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
extended
even
when
we
let
ourselves
go
as
much
as
we
can
but
suppose
for
a
moment
that
matter
consists
in
this
very
movement
pushed
further
and
that
physics
is
simply
psychics
inverted
we
shall
now
understand
why
the
mind
feels
at
its
ease
moves
about
naturally
in
space
when
matter
suggests
the
more
distinct
idea
of
it
this
space
it
already
possessed
as
an
implicit
idea
in
its
own
eventual
that
is
to
say
of
its
own
possible
the
mind
finds
space
in
things
but
could
have
got
it
without
them
if
it
had
had
imagination
strong
enough
to
push
the
inversion
of
its
own
natural
movement
to
the
end
on
the
other
hand
we
are
able
to
explain
how
matter
accentuates
still
more
its
materiality
when
viewed
by
the
mind
matter
at
first
aided
mind
to
run
down
its
own
incline
it
gave
the
impulsion
but
the
impulsion
once
received
mind
continues
its
course
the
idea
that
it
forms
of
space
is
only
the
of
the
limit
at
which
this
movement
would
end
once
in
possession
of
the
form
of
space
mind
uses
it
like
a
net
with
meshes
that
can
be
made
and
unmade
at
will
which
thrown
over
matter
divides
it
as
the
needs
of
our
action
demand
thus
the
space
of
our
geometry
and
the
spatiality
of
things
are
mutually
engendered
by
the
reciprocal
action
and
reaction
of
two
terms
which
are
essentially
the
same
but
which
move
each
in
the
direction
inverse
of
the
other
neither
is
space
so
foreign
to
our
nature
as
we
imagine
nor
is
matter
as
completely
extended
in
space
as
our
senses
and
intellect
represent
it
we
have
treated
of
the
first
point
elsewhere
as
to
the
second
we
will
limit
ourselves
to
pointing
out
that
perfect
spatiality
would
consist
in
a
perfect
externality
of
parts
in
their
relation
to
one
another
that
is
to
say
in
a
complete
reciprocal
independence
now
there
is
no
material
point
that
does
not
act
on
every
other
material
point
when
we
observe
that
a
thing
really
is
there
where
it
we
shall
be
led
to
say
as
faraday
was
that
all
the
atoms
interpenetrate
and
that
each
of
them
fills
the
world
on
such
a
hypothesis
the
atom
or
more
generally
the
material
point
becomes
simply
a
view
of
the
mind
a
view
which
we
come
to
take
when
we
continue
far
enough
the
work
wholly
relative
to
our
faculty
of
acting
by
which
we
subdivide
matter
into
bodies
yet
it
is
undeniable
that
matter
lends
itself
to
this
subdivision
and
that
in
supposing
it
breakable
into
parts
external
to
one
another
we
are
constructing
a
science
sufficiently
representative
of
the
real
it
is
undeniable
that
if
there
be
no
entirely
isolated
system
yet
science
finds
means
of
cutting
up
the
universe
into
systems
relatively
independent
of
each
other
and
commits
no
appreciable
error
in
doing
so
what
else
can
this
mean
but
that
matter
itself
in
space
without
being
absolutely
therein
and
that
in
regarding
matter
as
decomposable
into
isolated
systems
in
attributing
to
it
quite
distinct
elements
which
change
in
relation
to
each
other
without
changing
in
themselves
which
are
displaced
shall
we
say
without
being
altered
in
short
in
conferring
on
matter
the
properties
of
pure
space
we
are
transporting
ourselves
to
the
terminal
point
of
the
movement
of
which
matter
simply
indicates
the
direction
what
the
of
kant
appears
to
have
established
once
for
all
is
that
extension
is
not
a
material
attribute
of
the
same
kind
as
others
we
can
not
reason
indefinitely
on
the
notions
of
heat
color
or
weight
in
order
to
know
the
modalities
of
weight
or
of
heat
we
must
have
recourse
to
experience
not
so
of
the
notion
of
space
supposing
even
that
it
is
given
empirically
by
sight
and
touch
and
kant
has
not
questioned
the
fact
there
is
this
about
it
that
is
remarkable
that
our
mind
speculating
on
it
with
its
own
powers
alone
cuts
out
in
it
figures
whose
properties
we
determine
experience
with
which
we
have
not
kept
in
touch
yet
follows
us
through
the
infinite
complications
of
our
reasonings
and
invariably
justifies
them
that
is
the
fact
kant
has
set
it
in
clear
light
but
the
explanation
of
the
fact
we
believe
must
be
sought
in
a
different
direction
to
that
which
kant
followed
intelligence
as
kant
represents
it
to
us
is
bathed
in
an
atmosphere
of
spatiality
to
which
it
is
as
inseparably
united
as
the
living
body
to
the
air
it
breathes
our
perceptions
reach
us
only
after
having
passed
through
this
atmosphere
they
have
been
impregnated
in
advance
by
our
geometry
so
that
our
faculty
of
thinking
only
finds
again
in
matter
the
mathematical
properties
which
our
faculty
of
perceiving
has
already
deposed
there
we
are
assured
therefore
of
seeing
matter
yield
itself
with
docility
to
our
reasonings
but
this
matter
in
all
that
it
has
that
is
intelligible
is
our
own
work
of
the
reality
in
itself
we
know
nothing
and
never
shall
know
anything
since
we
only
get
its
refraction
through
the
forms
of
our
faculty
of
perceiving
so
that
if
we
claim
to
affirm
something
of
it
at
once
there
rises
the
contrary
affirmation
equally
demonstrable
equally
plausible
the
ideality
of
space
is
proved
directly
by
the
analysis
of
knowledge
indirectly
by
the
antinomies
to
which
the
opposite
theory
leads
such
is
the
governing
idea
of
the
kantian
criticism
it
has
inspired
kant
with
a
peremptory
refutation
of
empiricist
theories
of
knowledge
it
is
in
our
opinion
definitive
in
what
it
denies
but
in
what
it
affirms
does
it
give
us
the
solution
of
the
problem
with
kant
space
is
given
as
a
form
of
our
perceptive
faculty
a
veritable
ex
of
which
we
see
neither
how
it
arises
nor
why
it
is
what
it
is
rather
than
anything
else
are
also
given
of
which
he
claims
that
we
can
know
nothing
by
what
right
then
can
he
affirm
their
existence
even
as
problematic
if
the
unknowable
reality
projects
into
our
perceptive
faculty
a
sensuous
manifold
capable
of
fitting
into
it
exactly
is
it
not
by
that
very
fact
in
part
known
and
when
we
examine
this
exact
fitting
shall
we
not
be
led
in
one
point
at
least
to
suppose
a
harmony
between
things
and
our
mind
an
idle
hypothesis
which
kant
was
right
in
wishing
to
avoid
at
bottom
it
is
for
not
having
distinguished
degrees
in
spatiality
that
he
has
had
to
take
space
as
given
whence
the
question
how
the
sensuous
manifold
is
adapted
to
it
it
is
for
the
same
reason
that
he
has
supposed
matter
wholly
developed
into
parts
absolutely
external
to
one
another
whence
antinomies
of
which
we
may
plainly
see
that
the
thesis
and
antithesis
suppose
the
perfect
coincidence
of
matter
with
geometrical
space
but
which
vanish
the
moment
we
cease
to
extend
to
matter
what
is
true
only
of
pure
space
whence
finally
the
conclusion
that
there
are
three
alternatives
and
three
only
among
which
to
choose
a
theory
of
knowledge
either
the
mind
is
determined
by
things
or
things
are
determined
by
the
mind
or
between
mind
and
things
we
must
suppose
a
mysterious
agreement
but
the
truth
is
that
there
is
a
fourth
which
does
not
seem
to
have
occurred
to
kant
in
the
first
place
because
he
did
not
think
that
the
mind
overflowed
the
intellect
and
in
the
second
place
and
this
is
at
bottom
the
same
thing
because
he
did
not
attribute
to
duration
an
absolute
existence
having
put
time
on
the
same
plane
as
space
this
alternative
consists
first
of
all
in
regarding
the
intellect
as
a
special
function
of
the
mind
essentially
turned
toward
inert
matter
then
in
saying
that
neither
does
matter
determine
the
form
of
the
intellect
nor
does
the
intellect
impose
its
form
on
matter
nor
have
matter
and
intellect
been
regulated
in
regard
to
one
another
by
we
know
not
what
harmony
but
that
intellect
and
matter
have
progressively
adapted
themselves
one
to
the
other
in
order
to
attain
at
last
a
common
form
adaptation
has
moreover
been
brought
about
quite
naturally
because
it
is
the
same
inversion
of
the
same
movement
which
creates
at
once
the
intellectuality
of
mind
and
the
materiality
of
from
this
point
of
view
the
knowledge
of
matter
that
our
perception
on
one
hand
and
science
on
the
other
give
to
us
appears
no
doubt
as
approximative
but
not
as
relative
our
perception
whose
rôle
it
is
to
hold
up
a
light
to
our
actions
works
a
dividing
up
of
matter
that
is
always
too
sharply
defined
always
subordinated
to
practical
needs
consequently
always
requiring
revision
our
science
which
aspires
to
the
mathematical
form
the
spatiality
of
matter
its
formulae
are
in
general
too
precise
and
ever
need
remaking
for
a
scientific
theory
to
be
final
the
mind
would
have
to
embrace
the
totality
of
things
in
block
and
place
each
thing
in
its
exact
relation
to
every
other
thing
but
in
reality
we
are
obliged
to
consider
problems
one
by
one
in
terms
which
are
for
that
very
reason
provisional
so
that
the
solution
of
each
problem
will
have
to
be
corrected
indefinitely
by
the
solution
that
will
be
given
to
the
problems
that
will
follow
thus
science
as
a
whole
is
relative
to
the
particular
order
in
which
the
problems
happen
to
have
been
put
it
is
in
this
meaning
and
to
this
degree
that
science
must
be
regarded
as
conventional
but
it
is
a
conventionality
of
fact
so
to
speak
and
not
of
right
in
principle
positive
science
bears
on
reality
itself
provided
it
does
not
overstep
the
limits
of
its
own
domain
which
is
inert
matter
scientific
knowledge
thus
regarded
rises
to
a
higher
plane
in
return
the
theory
of
knowledge
becomes
an
infinitely
difficult
enterprise
and
which
passes
the
powers
of
the
intellect
alone
it
is
not
enough
to
determine
by
careful
analysis
the
categories
of
thought
we
must
engender
them
as
regards
space
we
must
by
an
effort
of
mind
follow
the
progression
or
rather
the
regression
of
the
degrading
itself
into
spatiality
when
we
make
ourselves
in
the
highest
possible
degree
and
then
let
ourselves
fall
back
little
by
little
we
get
the
feeling
of
extension
we
have
an
extension
of
the
self
into
recollections
that
are
fixed
and
external
to
one
another
in
place
of
the
tension
it
possessed
as
an
indivisible
active
will
but
this
is
only
a
beginning
our
consciousness
sketching
the
movement
shows
us
its
direction
and
reveals
to
us
the
possibility
of
continuing
it
to
the
end
but
consciousness
itself
does
not
go
so
far
now
on
the
other
hand
if
we
consider
matter
which
seems
to
us
at
first
coincident
with
space
we
find
that
the
more
our
attention
is
fixed
on
it
the
more
the
parts
which
we
said
were
laid
side
by
side
enter
into
each
other
each
of
them
undergoing
the
action
of
the
whole
which
is
consequently
somehow
present
in
it
thus
although
matter
stretches
itself
out
in
the
direction
of
space
it
does
not
completely
attain
it
whence
we
may
conclude
that
it
only
carries
very
much
further
the
movement
that
consciousness
is
able
to
sketch
within
us
in
its
nascent
state
we
hold
therefore
the
two
ends
of
the
chain
though
we
do
not
succeed
in
seizing
the
intermediate
links
will
they
always
escape
us
we
must
remember
that
philosophy
as
we
define
it
has
not
yet
become
completely
conscious
of
itself
physics
understands
its
rôle
when
it
pushes
matter
in
the
direction
of
spatiality
but
has
metaphysics
understood
its
rôle
when
it
has
simply
trodden
in
the
steps
of
physics
in
the
chimerical
hope
of
going
further
in
the
same
direction
should
not
its
own
task
be
on
the
contrary
to
remount
the
incline
that
physics
descends
to
bring
back
matter
to
its
origins
and
to
build
up
progressively
a
cosmology
which
would
be
so
to
speak
a
reversed
psychology
all
that
which
seems
to
the
physicist
and
to
the
geometrician
would
become
from
this
new
point
of
view
an
interruption
or
inversion
of
the
true
positivity
which
would
have
to
be
defined
in
psychological
terms
when
we
consider
the
admirable
order
of
mathematics
the
perfect
agreement
of
the
objects
it
deals
with
the
immanent
logic
in
numbers
and
figures
our
certainty
of
always
getting
the
same
conclusion
however
diverse
and
complex
our
reasonings
on
the
same
subject
we
hesitate
to
see
in
properties
apparently
so
positive
a
system
of
negations
the
absence
rather
than
the
presence
of
a
true
reality
but
we
must
not
forget
that
our
intellect
which
finds
this
order
and
wonders
at
it
is
directed
in
the
same
line
of
movement
that
leads
to
the
materiality
and
spatiality
of
its
object
the
more
complexity
the
intellect
puts
into
its
object
by
analyzing
it
the
more
complex
is
the
order
it
finds
there
and
this
order
and
this
complexity
necessarily
appear
to
the
intellect
as
a
positive
reality
since
reality
and
intellectuality
are
turned
in
the
same
direction
when
a
poet
reads
me
his
verses
i
can
interest
myself
enough
in
him
to
enter
into
his
thought
put
myself
into
his
feelings
live
over
again
the
simple
state
he
has
broken
into
phrases
and
words
i
sympathize
then
with
his
inspiration
i
follow
it
with
a
continuous
movement
which
is
like
the
inspiration
itself
an
undivided
act
now
i
need
only
relax
my
attention
let
go
the
tension
that
there
is
in
me
for
the
sounds
hitherto
swallowed
up
in
the
sense
to
appear
to
me
distinctly
one
by
one
in
their
materiality
for
this
i
have
not
to
do
anything
it
is
enough
to
withdraw
something
in
proportion
as
i
let
myself
go
the
successive
sounds
will
become
the
more
individualized
as
the
phrases
were
broken
into
words
so
the
words
will
scan
in
syllables
which
i
shall
perceive
one
after
another
let
me
go
farther
still
in
the
direction
of
dream
the
letters
themselves
will
become
loose
and
will
be
seen
to
dance
along
hand
in
hand
on
some
fantastic
sheet
of
paper
i
shall
then
admire
the
precision
of
the
interweavings
the
marvelous
order
of
the
procession
the
exact
insertion
of
the
letters
into
the
syllables
of
the
syllables
into
the
words
and
of
the
words
into
the
sentences
the
farther
i
pursue
this
quite
negative
direction
of
relaxation
the
more
extension
and
complexity
i
shall
create
and
the
more
the
complexity
in
its
turn
increases
the
more
admirable
will
seem
to
be
the
order
which
continues
to
reign
undisturbed
among
the
elements
yet
this
complexity
and
extension
represent
nothing
positive
they
express
a
deficiency
of
will
and
on
the
other
hand
the
order
must
grow
with
the
complexity
since
it
is
only
an
aspect
of
it
the
more
we
perceive
symbolically
parts
in
an
indivisible
whole
the
more
the
number
of
the
relations
that
the
parts
have
between
themselves
necessarily
increases
since
the
same
undividedness
of
the
real
whole
continues
to
hover
over
the
growing
multiplicity
of
the
symbolic
elements
into
which
the
scattering
of
the
attention
has
decomposed
it
a
comparison
of
this
kind
will
enable
us
to
understand
in
some
measure
how
the
same
suppression
of
positive
reality
the
same
inversion
of
a
certain
original
movement
can
create
at
once
extension
in
space
and
the
admirable
order
which
mathematics
finds
there
there
is
of
course
this
difference
between
the
two
cases
that
words
and
letters
have
been
invented
by
a
positive
effort
of
humanity
while
space
arises
automatically
as
the
remainder
of
a
subtraction
arises
once
the
two
numbers
are
posited
but
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
the
infinite
complexity
of
the
parts
and
their
perfect
coördination
among
themselves
are
created
at
one
and
the
same
time
by
an
inversion
which
is
at
bottom
an
interruption
that
is
to
say
a
diminution
of
positive
reality
all
the
operations
of
our
intellect
tend
to
geometry
as
to
the
goal
where
they
find
their
perfect
fulfilment
but
as
geometry
is
necessarily
prior
to
them
since
these
operations
have
not
as
their
end
to
construct
space
and
can
not
do
otherwise
than
take
it
as
given
it
is
evident
that
it
is
a
latent
geometry
immanent
in
our
idea
of
space
which
is
the
main
spring
of
our
intellect
and
the
cause
of
its
working
we
shall
be
convinced
of
this
if
we
consider
the
two
essential
functions
of
intellect
the
faculty
of
deduction
and
that
of
induction
let
us
begin
with
deduction
the
same
movement
by
which
i
trace
a
figure
in
space
engenders
its
properties
they
are
visible
and
tangible
in
the
movement
itself
i
feel
i
see
in
space
the
relation
of
the
definition
to
its
consequences
of
the
premisses
to
the
conclusion
all
the
other
concepts
of
which
experience
suggests
the
idea
to
me
are
only
in
part
constructible
the
definition
of
them
is
therefore
imperfect
and
the
deductions
into
which
these
concepts
enter
however
closely
the
conclusion
is
linked
to
the
premisses
participate
in
this
imperfection
but
when
i
trace
roughly
in
the
sand
the
base
of
a
triangle
as
i
begin
to
form
the
two
angles
at
the
base
i
know
positively
and
understand
absolutely
that
if
these
two
angles
are
equal
the
sides
will
be
equal
also
the
figure
being
then
able
to
be
turned
over
on
itself
without
there
being
any
change
whatever
i
know
it
before
i
have
learnt
geometry
thus
prior
to
the
science
of
geometry
there
is
a
natural
geometry
whose
clearness
and
evidence
surpass
the
clearness
and
evidence
of
other
deductions
now
these
other
deductions
bear
on
qualities
and
not
on
magnitudes
purely
they
are
then
likely
to
have
been
formed
on
the
model
of
the
first
and
to
borrow
their
force
from
the
fact
that
behind
quality
we
see
magnitude
vaguely
showing
through
we
may
notice
as
a
fact
that
questions
of
situation
and
of
magnitude
are
the
first
that
present
themselves
to
our
activity
those
which
intelligence
externalized
in
action
resolves
even
before
reflective
intelligence
has
appeared
the
savage
understands
better
than
the
civilized
man
how
to
judge
distances
to
determine
a
direction
to
retrace
by
memory
the
often
complicated
plan
of
the
road
he
has
traveled
and
so
to
return
in
a
straight
line
to
his
if
the
animal
does
not
deduce
explicitly
if
he
does
not
form
explicit
concepts
neither
does
he
form
the
idea
of
a
homogeneous
space
you
can
not
present
this
space
to
yourself
without
introducing
in
the
same
act
a
virtual
geometry
which
will
of
itself
degrade
itself
into
logic
all
the
repugnance
that
philosophers
manifest
towards
this
manner
of
regarding
things
comes
from
this
that
the
logical
work
of
the
intellect
represents
to
their
eyes
a
positive
spiritual
effort
but
if
we
understand
by
spirituality
a
progress
to
ever
new
creations
to
conclusions
incommensurable
with
the
premisses
and
indeterminable
by
relation
to
them
we
must
say
of
an
idea
that
moves
among
relations
of
necessary
determination
through
premisses
which
contain
their
conclusion
in
advance
that
it
follows
the
inverse
direction
that
of
materiality
what
appears
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
intellect
as
an
effort
is
in
itself
a
letting
go
and
while
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
intellect
there
is
a
in
making
geometry
arise
automatically
from
space
and
logic
from
geometry
on
the
contrary
if
space
is
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
movement
of
space
can
not
be
given
without
positing
also
logic
and
geometry
which
are
along
the
course
of
the
movement
of
which
pure
spatial
intuition
is
the
goal
it
has
not
been
enough
noticed
how
feeble
is
the
reach
of
deduction
in
the
psychological
and
moral
sciences
from
a
proposition
verified
by
facts
verifiable
consequences
can
here
be
drawn
only
up
to
a
certain
point
only
in
a
certain
measure
very
soon
appeal
has
to
be
made
to
common
sense
that
is
to
say
to
the
continuous
experience
of
the
real
in
order
to
inflect
the
consequences
deduced
and
bend
them
along
the
sinuosities
of
life
deduction
succeeds
in
things
moral
only
metaphorically
so
to
speak
and
just
in
the
measure
in
which
the
moral
is
transposable
into
the
physical
i
should
say
translatable
into
spatial
symbols
the
metaphor
never
goes
very
far
any
more
than
a
curve
can
long
be
confused
with
its
tangent
must
we
not
be
struck
by
this
feebleness
of
deduction
as
something
very
strange
and
even
paradoxical
here
is
a
pure
operation
of
the
mind
accomplished
solely
by
the
power
of
the
mind
it
seems
that
if
anywhere
it
should
feel
at
home
and
evolve
at
ease
it
would
be
among
the
things
of
the
mind
in
the
domain
of
the
mind
not
at
all
it
is
there
that
it
is
immediately
at
the
end
of
its
tether
on
the
contrary
in
geometry
in
astronomy
in
physics
where
we
have
to
do
with
things
external
to
us
deduction
is
observation
and
experience
are
undoubtedly
necessary
in
these
sciences
to
arrive
at
the
principle
that
is
to
discover
the
aspect
under
which
things
must
be
regarded
but
strictly
speaking
we
might
by
good
luck
have
hit
upon
it
at
once
and
as
soon
as
we
possess
this
principle
we
may
draw
from
it
at
any
length
consequences
which
experience
will
always
verify
must
we
not
conclude
therefore
that
deduction
is
an
operation
governed
by
the
properties
of
matter
molded
on
the
mobile
articulations
of
matter
implicitly
given
in
fact
with
the
space
that
underlies
matter
as
long
as
it
turns
upon
space
or
spatialized
time
it
has
only
to
let
itself
go
it
is
that
puts
spokes
in
its
wheels
deduction
then
does
not
work
unless
there
be
spatial
intuition
behind
it
but
we
may
say
the
same
of
induction
it
is
not
necessary
indeed
to
think
geometrically
nor
even
to
think
at
all
in
order
to
expect
from
the
same
conditions
a
repetition
of
the
same
fact
the
consciousness
of
the
animal
already
does
this
work
and
indeed
independently
of
all
consciousness
the
living
body
itself
is
so
constructed
that
it
can
extract
from
the
successive
situations
in
which
it
finds
itself
the
similarities
which
interest
it
and
so
respond
to
the
stimuli
by
appropriate
reactions
but
it
is
a
far
cry
from
a
mechanical
expectation
and
reaction
of
the
body
to
induction
properly
so
called
which
is
an
intellectual
operation
induction
rests
on
the
belief
that
there
are
causes
and
effects
and
that
the
same
effects
follow
the
same
causes
now
if
we
examine
this
double
belief
this
is
what
we
find
it
implies
in
the
first
place
that
reality
is
decomposable
into
groups
which
can
be
practically
regarded
as
isolated
and
independent
if
i
boil
water
in
a
kettle
on
a
stove
the
operation
and
the
objects
that
support
it
are
in
reality
bound
up
with
a
multitude
of
other
objects
and
a
multitude
of
other
operations
in
the
end
i
should
find
that
our
entire
solar
system
is
concerned
in
what
is
being
done
at
this
particular
point
of
space
but
in
a
certain
measure
and
for
the
special
end
i
am
pursuing
i
may
admit
that
things
happen
as
if
the
group
were
an
independent
microcosm
that
is
my
first
affirmation
now
when
i
say
that
this
microcosm
will
always
behave
in
the
same
way
that
the
heat
will
necessarily
at
the
end
of
a
certain
time
cause
the
boiling
of
the
water
i
admit
that
it
is
sufficient
that
a
certain
number
of
elements
of
the
system
be
given
in
order
that
the
system
should
be
complete
it
completes
itself
automatically
i
am
not
free
to
complete
it
in
thought
as
i
please
the
stove
the
kettle
and
the
water
being
given
with
a
certain
interval
of
duration
it
seems
to
me
that
the
boiling
which
experience
showed
me
yesterday
to
be
the
only
thing
wanting
to
complete
the
system
will
complete
it
no
matter
when
may
be
what
is
there
at
the
base
of
this
belief
notice
that
the
belief
is
more
or
less
assured
according
as
the
case
may
be
but
that
it
is
forced
upon
the
mind
as
an
absolute
necessity
when
the
microcosm
considered
contains
only
magnitudes
if
two
numbers
be
given
i
am
not
free
to
choose
their
difference
if
two
sides
of
a
triangle
and
the
contained
angle
are
given
the
third
side
arises
of
itself
and
the
triangle
completes
itself
automatically
i
can
it
matters
not
where
and
it
matters
not
when
trace
the
same
two
sides
containing
the
same
angle
it
is
evident
that
the
new
triangles
so
formed
can
be
superposed
on
the
first
and
that
consequently
the
same
third
side
will
come
to
complete
the
system
now
if
my
certitude
is
perfect
in
the
case
in
which
i
reason
on
pure
space
determinations
must
i
not
suppose
that
in
the
other
cases
the
certitude
is
greater
the
nearer
it
approaches
this
extreme
case
indeed
may
it
not
be
the
limiting
case
which
is
seen
through
all
the
others
and
which
colors
them
accordingly
as
they
are
more
or
less
transparent
with
a
more
or
less
pronounced
tinge
of
geometrical
necessity
in
fact
when
i
say
that
the
water
on
the
fire
will
boil
as
it
did
yesterday
and
that
this
is
an
absolute
necessity
i
feel
vaguely
that
my
imagination
is
placing
the
stove
of
yesterday
on
that
of
kettle
on
kettle
water
on
water
duration
on
duration
and
it
seems
then
that
the
rest
must
coincide
also
for
the
same
reason
that
when
two
triangles
are
superposed
and
two
of
their
sides
coincide
their
third
sides
coincide
also
but
my
imagination
acts
thus
only
because
it
shuts
its
eyes
to
two
essential
points
for
the
system
of
actually
to
be
superimposed
on
that
of
yesterday
the
latter
must
have
waited
for
the
former
time
must
have
halted
and
everything
become
simultaneous
that
happens
in
geometry
but
in
geometry
alone
induction
therefore
implies
first
that
in
the
world
of
the
physicist
as
in
that
of
the
geometrician
time
does
not
count
but
it
implies
also
that
qualities
can
be
superposed
on
each
other
like
magnitudes
if
in
imagination
i
place
the
stove
and
fire
of
on
that
of
yesterday
i
find
indeed
that
the
form
has
remained
the
same
it
suffices
for
that
that
the
surfaces
and
edges
coincide
but
what
is
the
coincidence
of
two
qualities
and
how
can
they
be
superposed
one
on
another
in
order
to
ensure
that
they
are
identical
yet
i
extend
to
the
second
order
of
reality
all
that
applies
to
the
first
the
physicist
legitimates
this
operation
later
on
by
reducing
as
far
as
possible
differences
of
quality
to
differences
of
magnitude
but
prior
to
all
science
i
incline
to
liken
qualities
to
quantities
as
if
i
perceived
behind
the
qualities
as
through
a
transparency
a
geometrical
mechanism
the
more
complete
this
transparency
the
more
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
same
conditions
there
must
be
a
repetition
of
the
same
fact
our
inductions
are
certain
to
our
eyes
in
the
exact
degree
in
which
we
make
the
qualitative
differences
melt
into
the
homogeneity
of
the
space
which
subtends
them
so
that
geometry
is
the
ideal
limit
of
our
inductions
as
well
as
of
our
deductions
the
movement
at
the
end
of
which
is
spatiality
lays
down
along
its
course
the
faculty
of
induction
as
well
as
that
of
deduction
in
fact
intellectuality
entire
it
creates
them
in
the
mind
but
it
creates
also
in
things
the
order
which
our
induction
aided
by
deduction
finds
there
this
order
on
which
our
action
leans
and
in
which
our
intellect
recognizes
itself
seems
to
us
marvelous
not
only
do
the
same
general
causes
always
produce
the
same
general
effects
but
beneath
the
visible
causes
and
effects
our
science
discovers
an
infinity
of
infinitesimal
changes
which
work
more
and
more
exactly
into
one
another
the
further
we
push
the
analysis
so
much
so
that
at
the
end
of
this
analysis
matter
becomes
it
seems
to
us
geometry
itself
certainly
the
intellect
is
right
in
admiring
here
the
growing
order
in
the
growing
complexity
both
the
one
and
the
other
must
have
a
positive
reality
for
it
since
it
looks
upon
itself
as
positive
but
things
change
their
aspect
when
we
consider
the
whole
of
reality
as
an
undivided
advance
forward
to
successive
creations
it
seems
to
us
then
that
the
complexity
of
the
material
elements
and
the
mathematical
order
that
binds
them
together
must
arise
automatically
when
within
the
whole
a
partial
interruption
or
inversion
is
produced
moreover
as
the
intellect
itself
is
cut
out
of
mind
by
a
process
of
the
same
kind
it
is
attuned
to
this
order
and
complexity
and
admires
them
because
it
recognizes
itself
in
them
but
what
is
admirable
what
really
deserves
to
provoke
wonder
is
the
creation
which
reality
whole
and
undivided
accomplishes
in
advancing
for
no
complication
of
the
mathematical
order
with
itself
however
elaborate
we
may
suppose
it
can
introduce
an
atom
of
novelty
into
the
world
whereas
this
power
of
creation
once
given
and
it
exists
for
we
are
conscious
of
it
in
ourselves
at
least
when
we
act
freely
has
only
to
be
diverted
from
itself
to
relax
its
tension
only
to
relax
its
tension
to
extend
only
to
extend
for
the
mathematical
order
of
the
elements
so
distinguished
and
the
inflexible
determinism
connecting
them
to
manifest
the
interruption
of
the
creative
act
in
fact
inflexible
determinism
and
mathematical
order
are
one
with
this
very
interruption
it
is
this
merely
negative
tendency
that
the
particular
laws
of
the
physical
world
express
none
of
them
taken
separately
has
objective
reality
each
is
the
work
of
an
investigator
who
has
regarded
things
from
a
certain
bias
isolated
certain
variables
applied
certain
conventional
units
of
measurement
and
yet
there
is
an
order
approximately
mathematical
immanent
in
matter
an
objective
order
which
our
science
approaches
in
proportion
to
its
progress
for
if
matter
is
a
relaxation
of
the
inextensive
into
the
extensive
and
thereby
of
liberty
into
necessity
it
does
not
indeed
wholly
coincide
with
pure
homogeneous
space
yet
is
constituted
by
the
movement
which
leads
to
space
and
is
therefore
on
the
way
to
geometry
it
is
true
that
laws
of
mathematical
form
will
never
apply
to
it
completely
for
that
it
would
have
to
be
pure
space
and
step
out
of
duration
we
can
not
insist
too
strongly
that
there
is
something
artificial
in
the
mathematical
form
of
a
physical
law
and
consequently
in
our
scientific
knowledge
of
things
our
standards
of
measurement
are
conventional
and
so
to
say
foreign
to
the
intentions
of
nature
can
we
suppose
that
nature
has
related
all
the
modalities
of
heat
to
the
expansion
of
the
same
mass
of
mercury
or
to
the
change
of
pressure
of
the
same
mass
of
air
kept
at
a
constant
volume
but
we
may
go
further
in
a
general
way
is
a
wholly
human
operation
which
implies
that
we
really
or
ideally
superpose
two
objects
one
on
another
a
certain
number
of
times
nature
did
not
dream
of
this
superposition
it
does
not
measure
nor
does
it
count
yet
physics
counts
measures
relates
quantitative
variations
to
one
another
to
obtain
laws
and
it
succeeds
its
success
would
be
inexplicable
if
the
movement
which
constitutes
materiality
were
not
the
same
movement
which
prolonged
by
us
to
its
end
that
is
to
say
to
homogeneous
space
results
in
making
us
count
measure
follow
in
their
respective
variations
terms
that
are
functions
one
of
another
to
effect
this
prolongation
of
the
movement
our
intellect
has
only
to
let
itself
go
for
it
runs
naturally
to
space
and
mathematics
intellectuality
and
materiality
being
of
the
same
nature
and
having
been
produced
in
the
same
way
if
the
mathematical
order
were
a
positive
thing
if
there
were
immanent
in
matter
laws
comparable
to
those
of
our
codes
the
success
of
our
science
would
have
in
it
something
of
the
miraculous
what
chances
should
we
have
indeed
of
finding
the
standard
of
nature
and
of
isolating
exactly
in
order
to
determine
their
reciprocal
relations
the
very
variables
which
nature
has
chosen
but
the
success
of
a
science
of
mathematical
form
would
be
no
less
incomprehensible
if
matter
did
not
already
possess
everything
necessary
to
adapt
itself
to
our
formulae
one
hypothesis
only
therefore
remains
plausible
namely
that
the
mathematical
order
is
nothing
positive
that
it
is
the
form
toward
which
a
certain
tends
of
itself
and
that
materiality
consists
precisely
in
an
interruption
of
this
kind
we
shall
understand
then
why
our
science
is
contingent
relative
to
the
variables
it
has
chosen
relative
to
the
order
in
which
it
has
successively
put
the
problems
and
why
nevertheless
it
succeeds
it
might
have
been
as
a
whole
altogether
different
and
yet
have
succeeded
this
is
so
just
because
there
is
no
definite
system
of
mathematical
laws
at
the
base
of
nature
and
because
mathematics
in
general
represents
simply
the
side
to
which
matter
inclines
put
one
of
those
little
cork
dolls
with
leaden
feet
in
any
posture
lay
it
on
its
back
turn
it
up
on
its
head
throw
it
into
the
air
it
will
always
stand
itself
up
again
automatically
so
likewise
with
matter
we
can
take
it
by
any
end
and
handle
it
in
any
way
it
will
always
fall
back
into
some
one
of
our
mathematical
formulae
because
it
is
weighted
with
geometry
but
the
philosopher
will
perhaps
refuse
to
found
a
theory
of
knowledge
on
such
considerations
they
will
be
repugnant
to
him
because
the
mathematical
order
being
order
will
appear
to
him
to
contain
something
positive
it
is
in
vain
that
we
assert
that
this
order
produces
itself
automatically
by
the
interruption
of
the
inverse
order
that
it
is
this
very
interruption
the
idea
persists
none
the
less
that
might
be
no
order
at
and
that
the
mathematical
order
of
things
being
a
conquest
over
disorder
possesses
a
positive
reality
in
examining
this
point
we
shall
see
what
a
prominent
part
the
idea
of
plays
in
problems
relative
to
the
theory
of
knowledge
it
does
not
appear
explicitly
and
that
is
why
it
escapes
our
attention
it
is
however
with
the
criticism
of
this
idea
that
a
theory
of
knowledge
ought
to
begin
for
if
the
great
problem
is
to
know
why
and
how
reality
submits
itself
to
an
order
it
is
because
the
absence
of
every
kind
of
order
appears
possible
or
conceivable
it
is
this
absence
of
order
that
realists
and
idealists
alike
believe
they
are
thinking
of
the
realist
when
he
speaks
of
the
regularity
that
objective
laws
actually
impose
on
a
virtual
disorder
of
nature
the
idealist
when
he
supposes
a
sensuous
manifold
which
is
coördinated
and
consequently
itself
without
order
under
the
organizing
influence
of
our
understanding
the
idea
of
disorder
in
the
sense
of
of
is
then
what
must
be
analyzed
first
philosophy
borrows
it
from
daily
life
and
it
is
unquestionable
that
when
ordinarily
we
speak
of
disorder
we
are
thinking
of
something
but
of
what
it
will
be
seen
in
the
next
chapter
how
hard
it
is
to
determine
the
content
of
a
negative
idea
and
what
illusions
one
is
liable
to
what
hopeless
difficulties
philosophy
falls
into
for
not
having
undertaken
this
task
difficulties
and
illusions
are
generally
due
to
this
that
we
accept
as
final
a
manner
of
expression
essentially
provisional
they
are
due
to
our
bringing
into
the
domain
of
speculation
a
procedure
made
for
practice
if
i
choose
a
volume
in
my
library
at
random
i
may
put
it
back
on
the
shelf
after
glancing
at
it
and
say
this
is
not
verse
is
this
what
i
have
really
seen
in
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
obviously
not
i
have
not
seen
i
never
shall
see
an
absence
of
verse
i
have
seen
prose
but
as
it
is
poetry
i
want
i
express
what
i
find
as
a
function
of
what
i
am
looking
for
and
instead
of
saying
this
is
prose
i
say
this
is
not
verse
in
the
same
way
if
the
fancy
takes
me
to
read
prose
and
i
happen
on
a
volume
of
verse
i
shall
say
this
is
not
prose
thus
expressing
the
data
of
my
perception
which
shows
me
verse
in
the
language
of
my
expectation
and
attention
which
are
fixed
on
the
idea
of
prose
and
will
hear
of
nothing
else
now
if
mons
jourdain
heard
me
he
would
infer
no
doubt
from
my
two
exclamations
that
prose
and
poetry
are
two
forms
of
language
reserved
for
books
and
that
these
learned
forms
have
come
and
overlaid
a
language
which
was
neither
prose
nor
verse
speaking
of
this
thing
which
is
neither
verse
nor
prose
he
would
suppose
moreover
that
he
was
thinking
of
it
it
would
be
only
a
however
let
us
go
further
still
the
would
create
a
if
jourdain
were
to
ask
his
professor
of
philosophy
how
the
prose
form
and
the
poetry
form
have
been
superadded
to
that
which
possessed
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
and
if
he
wished
the
professor
to
construct
a
theory
of
the
imposition
of
these
two
forms
upon
this
formless
matter
his
question
would
be
absurd
and
the
absurdity
would
lie
in
this
that
he
was
hypostasizing
as
the
substratum
of
prose
and
poetry
the
simultaneous
negation
of
both
forgetting
that
the
negation
of
the
one
consists
in
the
affirmation
of
the
other
now
suppose
that
there
are
two
species
of
order
and
that
these
two
orders
are
two
contraries
within
one
and
the
same
genus
suppose
also
that
the
idea
of
disorder
arises
in
our
mind
whenever
seeking
one
of
the
two
kinds
of
order
we
find
the
other
the
idea
of
disorder
would
then
have
a
clear
meaning
in
the
current
practice
of
life
it
would
objectify
for
the
convenience
of
language
the
disappointment
of
a
mind
that
finds
before
it
an
order
different
from
what
it
wants
an
order
with
which
it
is
not
concerned
at
the
moment
and
which
in
this
sense
does
not
exist
for
it
but
the
idea
would
not
admit
a
theoretical
use
so
if
we
claim
notwithstanding
to
introduce
it
into
philosophy
we
shall
inevitably
lose
sight
of
its
true
meaning
it
denotes
the
absence
of
a
certain
order
but
the
profit
of
with
which
we
are
not
concerned
only
as
it
applies
to
each
of
the
two
in
turn
and
as
it
even
goes
and
comes
continually
between
the
two
we
take
it
on
the
way
or
rather
on
the
wing
like
a
shuttlecock
between
two
battledores
and
treat
it
as
if
it
represented
not
the
absence
of
the
one
or
other
order
as
the
case
may
be
but
the
absence
of
both
together
a
thing
that
is
neither
perceived
nor
conceived
a
simple
verbal
entity
so
there
arises
the
problem
how
order
is
imposed
on
disorder
form
on
matter
in
analyzing
the
idea
of
disorder
thus
subtilized
we
shall
see
that
it
represents
nothing
at
all
and
at
the
same
time
the
problems
that
have
been
raised
around
it
will
vanish
it
is
true
that
we
must
begin
by
distinguishing
and
even
by
opposing
one
to
the
other
two
kinds
of
order
which
we
generally
confuse
as
this
confusion
has
created
the
principal
difficulties
of
the
problem
of
knowledge
it
will
not
be
useless
to
dwell
once
more
on
the
marks
by
which
the
two
orders
are
distinguished
in
a
general
way
reality
is
exactly
to
the
degree
in
which
it
satisfies
our
thought
order
is
therefore
a
certain
agreement
between
subject
and
object
it
is
the
mind
finding
itself
again
in
things
but
the
mind
we
said
can
go
in
two
opposite
ways
sometimes
it
follows
its
natural
direction
there
is
then
progress
in
the
form
of
tension
continuous
creation
free
activity
sometimes
it
inverts
it
and
this
inversion
pushed
to
the
end
leads
to
extension
to
the
necessary
reciprocal
determination
of
elements
externalized
each
by
relation
to
the
others
in
short
to
geometrical
mechanism
now
whether
experience
seems
to
us
to
adopt
the
first
direction
or
whether
it
is
drawn
in
the
direction
of
the
second
in
both
cases
we
say
there
is
order
for
in
the
two
processes
the
mind
finds
itself
again
the
confusion
between
them
is
therefore
natural
to
escape
it
different
names
would
have
to
be
given
to
the
two
kinds
of
order
and
that
is
not
easy
because
of
the
variety
and
variability
of
the
forms
they
take
the
order
of
the
second
kind
may
be
defined
as
geometry
which
is
its
extreme
limit
more
generally
it
is
that
kind
of
order
that
is
concerned
whenever
a
relation
of
necessary
determination
is
found
between
causes
and
effects
it
evokes
ideas
of
inertia
of
passivity
of
automatism
as
to
the
first
kind
of
order
it
oscillates
no
doubt
around
finality
and
yet
we
can
not
define
it
as
finality
for
it
is
sometimes
above
sometimes
below
in
its
highest
forms
it
is
more
than
finality
for
of
a
free
action
or
a
work
of
art
we
may
say
that
they
show
a
perfect
order
and
yet
they
can
only
be
expressed
in
terms
of
ideas
approximately
and
after
the
event
life
in
its
entirety
regarded
as
a
creative
evolution
is
something
analogous
it
transcends
finality
if
we
understand
by
finality
the
realization
of
an
idea
conceived
or
conceivable
in
advance
the
category
of
finality
is
therefore
too
narrow
for
life
in
its
entirety
it
is
on
the
other
hand
often
too
wide
for
a
particular
manifestation
of
life
taken
separately
be
that
as
it
may
it
is
with
the
that
we
have
here
to
do
and
the
whole
present
study
strives
to
prove
that
the
vital
is
in
the
direction
of
the
voluntary
we
may
say
then
that
this
first
kind
of
order
is
that
of
the
or
of
the
in
opposition
to
the
second
which
is
that
of
the
and
the
common
sense
instinctively
distinguishes
between
the
two
kinds
of
order
at
least
in
the
extreme
cases
instinctively
also
it
brings
them
together
we
say
of
astronomical
phenomena
that
they
manifest
an
admirable
order
meaning
by
this
that
they
can
be
foreseen
mathematically
and
we
find
an
order
no
less
admirable
in
a
symphony
of
beethoven
which
is
genius
originality
and
therefore
unforeseeability
itself
but
it
is
exceptional
for
order
of
the
first
kind
to
take
so
distinct
a
form
ordinarily
it
presents
features
that
we
have
every
interest
in
confusing
with
those
of
the
opposite
order
it
is
quite
certain
for
instance
that
if
we
could
view
the
evolution
of
life
in
its
entirety
the
spontaneity
of
its
movement
and
the
unforeseeability
of
its
procedures
would
thrust
themselves
on
our
attention
but
what
we
meet
in
our
daily
experience
is
a
certain
determinate
living
being
certain
special
manifestations
of
life
which
repeat
forms
and
facts
already
known
indeed
the
similarity
of
structure
that
we
find
everywhere
between
what
generates
and
what
is
generated
a
similarity
that
enables
us
to
include
any
number
of
living
individuals
in
the
same
group
is
to
our
eyes
the
very
type
of
the
the
inorganic
genera
seem
to
us
to
take
living
genera
as
models
thus
the
vital
order
such
as
it
is
offered
to
us
piecemeal
in
experience
presents
the
same
character
and
performs
the
same
function
as
the
physical
order
both
cause
experience
to
both
enable
our
mind
to
in
reality
this
character
has
entirely
different
origins
in
the
two
cases
and
even
opposite
meanings
in
the
second
case
the
type
of
this
character
its
ideal
limit
as
also
its
foundation
is
the
geometrical
necessity
in
virtue
of
which
the
same
components
give
the
same
resultant
in
the
first
case
this
character
involves
on
the
contrary
the
intervention
of
something
which
manages
to
obtain
the
same
total
effect
although
the
infinitely
complex
elementary
causes
may
be
quite
different
we
insisted
on
this
last
point
in
our
first
chapter
when
we
showed
how
identical
structures
are
to
be
met
with
on
independent
lines
of
evolution
but
without
looking
so
far
we
may
presume
that
the
reproduction
only
of
the
type
of
the
ancestor
by
his
descendants
is
an
entirely
different
thing
from
the
repetition
of
the
same
composition
of
forces
which
yields
an
identical
resultant
when
we
think
of
the
infinity
of
infinitesimal
elements
and
of
infinitesimal
causes
that
concur
in
the
genesis
of
a
living
being
when
we
reflect
that
the
absence
or
the
deviation
of
one
of
them
would
spoil
everything
the
first
impulse
of
the
mind
is
to
consider
this
army
of
little
workers
as
watched
over
by
a
skilled
foreman
the
vital
principle
which
is
ever
repairing
faults
correcting
effects
of
neglect
or
absentmindedness
putting
things
back
in
place
this
is
how
we
try
to
express
the
difference
between
the
physical
and
the
vital
order
the
former
making
the
same
combination
of
causes
give
the
same
combined
effect
the
latter
securing
the
constancy
of
the
effect
even
when
there
is
some
wavering
in
the
causes
but
that
is
only
a
comparison
on
reflection
we
find
that
there
can
be
no
foreman
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
there
are
no
workers
the
causes
and
elements
that
analysis
discovers
are
real
causes
and
elements
no
doubt
as
far
as
the
facts
of
organic
destruction
are
concerned
they
are
then
limited
in
number
but
vital
phenomena
properly
so
called
or
facts
of
organic
creation
open
up
to
us
when
we
analyze
them
the
perspective
of
an
analysis
passing
away
to
infinity
whence
it
may
be
inferred
that
the
manifold
causes
and
elements
are
here
only
views
of
the
mind
attempting
an
ever
closer
and
closer
imitation
of
the
operation
of
nature
while
the
operation
imitated
is
an
indivisible
act
the
likeness
between
individuals
of
the
same
species
has
thus
an
entirely
different
meaning
an
entirely
different
origin
to
that
of
the
likeness
between
complex
effects
obtained
by
the
same
composition
of
the
same
causes
but
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
there
is
and
consequently
possible
generalization
and
as
that
is
all
that
interests
us
in
practice
since
our
daily
life
is
and
must
be
an
expectation
of
the
same
things
and
the
same
situations
it
is
natural
that
this
common
character
essential
from
the
point
of
view
of
our
action
should
bring
the
two
orders
together
in
spite
of
a
merely
internal
diversity
between
them
which
interests
speculation
only
hence
the
idea
of
a
order
of
everywhere
the
same
hovering
over
life
and
over
matter
alike
hence
our
habit
of
designating
by
the
same
word
and
representing
in
the
same
way
the
existence
of
in
the
domain
of
inert
matter
and
that
of
in
the
domain
of
life
now
it
will
be
found
that
this
confusion
is
the
origin
of
most
of
the
difficulties
raised
by
the
problem
of
knowledge
among
the
ancients
as
well
as
among
the
moderns
the
generality
of
laws
and
that
of
genera
having
been
designated
by
the
same
word
and
subsumed
under
the
same
idea
the
geometrical
order
and
the
vital
order
are
accordingly
confused
together
according
to
the
point
of
view
the
generality
of
laws
is
explained
by
that
of
genera
or
that
of
genera
by
that
of
laws
the
first
view
is
characteristic
of
ancient
thought
the
second
belongs
to
modern
philosophy
but
in
both
ancient
and
modern
philosophy
the
idea
of
generality
is
an
equivocal
idea
uniting
in
its
denotation
and
in
its
connotation
incompatible
objects
and
elements
in
both
there
are
grouped
under
the
same
concept
two
kinds
of
order
which
are
alike
only
in
the
facility
they
give
to
our
action
on
things
we
bring
together
the
two
terms
in
virtue
of
a
quite
external
likeness
which
justifies
no
doubt
their
designation
by
the
same
word
for
practice
but
which
does
not
authorize
us
at
all
in
the
speculative
domain
to
confuse
them
in
the
same
definition
the
ancients
indeed
did
not
ask
why
nature
submits
to
laws
but
why
it
is
ordered
according
to
genera
the
idea
of
genus
corresponds
more
especially
to
an
objective
reality
in
the
domain
of
life
where
it
expresses
an
unquestionable
fact
heredity
indeed
there
can
only
be
genera
where
there
are
individual
objects
now
while
the
organized
being
is
cut
out
from
the
general
mass
of
matter
by
his
very
organization
that
is
to
say
naturally
it
is
our
perception
which
cuts
inert
matter
into
distinct
bodies
it
is
guided
in
this
by
the
interests
of
action
by
the
nascent
reactions
that
our
body
indicates
that
is
as
we
have
shown
elsewhere
by
the
potential
genera
that
are
trying
to
gain
existence
in
this
then
genera
and
individuals
determine
one
another
by
a
operation
entirely
relative
to
our
future
action
on
things
nevertheless
the
ancients
did
not
hesitate
to
put
all
genera
in
the
same
rank
to
attribute
the
same
absolute
existence
to
all
of
them
reality
thus
being
a
system
of
genera
it
is
to
the
generality
of
the
genera
that
is
in
effect
to
the
generality
expressive
of
the
vital
order
that
the
generality
of
laws
itself
had
to
be
brought
it
is
interesting
in
this
respect
to
compare
the
aristotelian
theory
of
the
fall
of
bodies
with
the
explanation
furnished
by
galileo
aristotle
is
concerned
solely
with
the
concepts
high
and
low
own
proper
place
as
distinguished
from
place
occupied
natural
movement
and
forced
movement
the
physical
law
in
virtue
of
which
the
stone
falls
expresses
for
him
that
the
stone
regains
the
natural
place
of
all
stones
to
wit
the
earth
the
stone
in
his
view
is
not
quite
stone
so
long
as
it
is
not
in
its
normal
place
in
falling
back
into
this
place
it
aims
at
completing
itself
like
a
living
being
that
grows
thus
realizing
fully
the
essence
of
the
genus
stone
if
this
conception
of
the
physical
law
were
exact
the
law
would
no
longer
be
a
mere
relation
established
by
the
mind
the
subdivision
of
matter
into
bodies
would
no
longer
be
relative
to
our
faculty
of
perceiving
all
bodies
would
have
the
same
individuality
as
living
bodies
and
the
laws
of
the
physical
universe
would
express
relations
of
real
kinship
between
real
genera
we
know
what
kind
of
physics
grew
out
of
this
and
how
for
having
believed
in
a
science
unique
and
final
embracing
the
totality
of
the
real
and
at
one
with
the
absolute
the
ancients
were
confined
in
fact
to
a
more
or
less
clumsy
interpretation
of
the
physical
in
terms
of
the
vital
but
there
is
the
same
confusion
in
the
moderns
with
this
difference
however
that
the
relation
between
the
two
terms
is
inverted
laws
are
no
longer
reduced
to
genera
but
genera
to
laws
and
science
still
supposed
to
be
uniquely
one
becomes
altogether
relative
instead
of
being
as
the
ancients
wished
altogether
at
one
with
the
absolute
a
noteworthy
fact
is
the
eclipse
of
the
problem
of
genera
in
modern
philosophy
our
theory
of
knowledge
turns
almost
entirely
on
the
question
of
laws
genera
are
left
to
make
shift
with
laws
as
best
they
can
the
reason
is
that
modern
philosophy
has
its
point
of
departure
in
the
great
astronomical
and
physical
discoveries
of
modern
times
the
laws
of
kepler
and
of
galileo
have
remained
for
it
the
ideal
and
unique
type
of
all
knowledge
now
a
law
is
a
relation
between
things
or
between
facts
more
precisely
a
law
of
mathematical
form
expresses
the
fact
that
a
certain
magnitude
is
a
function
of
one
or
several
other
variables
appropriately
chosen
now
the
choice
of
the
variable
magnitudes
the
distribution
of
nature
into
objects
and
into
facts
has
already
something
of
the
contingent
and
the
conventional
but
admitting
that
the
choice
is
hinted
at
if
not
prescribed
by
experience
the
law
remains
none
the
less
a
relation
and
a
relation
is
essentially
a
comparison
it
has
objective
reality
only
for
an
intelligence
that
represents
to
itself
several
terms
at
the
same
time
this
intelligence
may
be
neither
mine
nor
yours
a
science
which
bears
on
laws
may
therefore
be
an
objective
science
which
experience
contains
in
advance
and
which
we
simply
make
it
disgorge
but
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
a
comparison
of
some
kind
must
be
effected
here
impersonally
if
not
by
any
one
in
particular
and
that
an
experience
made
of
laws
that
is
of
terms
to
other
terms
is
an
experience
made
of
comparisons
which
before
we
receive
it
has
already
had
to
pass
through
an
atmosphere
of
intellectuality
the
idea
of
a
science
and
of
an
experience
entirely
relative
to
the
human
understanding
was
therefore
implicitly
contained
in
the
conception
of
a
science
one
and
integral
composed
of
laws
kant
only
brought
it
to
light
but
this
conception
is
the
result
of
an
arbitrary
confusion
between
the
generality
of
laws
and
that
of
genera
though
an
intelligence
be
necessary
to
condition
terms
by
relation
to
each
other
we
may
conceive
that
in
certain
cases
the
terms
themselves
may
exist
independently
and
if
beside
relations
of
term
to
term
experience
also
presents
to
us
independent
terms
the
living
genera
being
something
quite
different
from
systems
of
laws
one
half
at
least
of
our
knowledge
bears
on
the
the
very
reality
this
knowledge
may
be
very
difficult
just
because
it
no
longer
builds
up
its
own
object
and
is
obliged
on
the
contrary
to
submit
to
it
but
however
little
it
cuts
into
its
object
it
is
into
the
absolute
itself
that
it
bites
we
may
go
further
the
other
half
of
knowledge
is
no
longer
so
radically
so
definitely
relative
as
certain
philosophers
say
if
we
can
establish
that
it
bears
on
a
reality
of
inverse
order
a
reality
which
we
always
express
in
mathematical
laws
that
is
to
say
in
relations
that
imply
comparisons
but
which
lends
itself
to
this
work
only
because
it
is
weighted
with
spatiality
and
consequently
with
geometry
be
that
as
it
may
it
is
the
confusion
of
two
kinds
of
order
that
lies
behind
the
relativism
of
the
moderns
as
it
lay
behind
the
dogmatism
of
the
ancients
we
have
said
enough
to
mark
the
origin
of
this
confusion
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
vital
order
which
is
essentially
creation
is
manifested
to
us
less
in
its
essence
than
in
some
of
its
accidents
those
which
the
physical
and
geometrical
order
like
it
they
present
to
us
repetitions
that
make
generalization
possible
and
in
that
we
have
all
that
interests
us
there
is
no
doubt
that
life
as
a
whole
is
an
evolution
that
is
an
unceasing
transformation
but
life
can
progress
only
by
means
of
the
living
which
are
its
depositaries
innumerable
living
beings
almost
alike
have
to
repeat
each
other
in
space
and
in
time
for
the
novelty
they
are
working
out
to
grow
and
mature
it
is
like
a
book
that
advances
towards
a
new
edition
by
going
through
thousands
of
reprints
with
thousands
of
copies
there
is
however
this
difference
between
the
two
cases
that
the
successive
impressions
are
identical
as
well
as
the
simultaneous
copies
of
the
same
impression
whereas
representatives
of
one
and
the
same
species
are
never
entirely
the
same
either
in
different
points
of
space
or
at
different
moments
of
time
heredity
does
not
only
transmit
characters
it
transmits
also
the
impetus
in
virtue
of
which
the
characters
are
modified
and
this
impetus
is
vitality
itself
that
is
why
we
say
that
the
repetition
which
serves
as
the
base
of
our
generalizations
is
essential
in
the
physical
order
accidental
in
the
vital
order
the
physical
order
is
automatic
the
vital
order
is
i
will
not
say
voluntary
but
analogous
to
the
order
willed
now
as
soon
as
we
have
clearly
distinguished
between
the
order
that
is
willed
and
the
order
that
is
automatic
the
ambiguity
that
underlies
the
idea
of
is
dissipated
and
with
it
one
of
the
principal
difficulties
of
the
problem
of
knowledge
the
main
problem
of
the
theory
of
knowledge
is
to
know
how
science
is
possible
that
is
to
say
in
effect
why
there
is
order
and
not
disorder
in
things
that
order
exists
is
a
but
on
the
other
hand
disorder
appears
to
us
to
be
less
than
is
it
seems
of
the
existence
of
order
is
then
a
mystery
to
be
cleared
up
at
any
rate
a
problem
to
be
solved
more
simply
when
we
undertake
to
found
order
we
regard
it
as
contingent
if
not
in
things
at
least
as
viewed
by
the
mind
of
a
thing
that
we
do
not
judge
to
be
contingent
we
do
not
require
an
explanation
if
order
did
not
appear
to
us
as
a
conquest
over
something
or
as
an
addition
to
something
which
something
is
thought
to
be
the
absence
of
order
ancient
realism
would
not
have
spoken
of
a
matter
to
which
the
idea
superadded
itself
nor
would
modern
idealism
have
supposed
a
sensuous
manifold
that
the
understanding
organizes
into
nature
now
it
is
unquestionable
that
all
order
is
contingent
and
conceived
as
such
but
contingent
in
relation
to
what
the
reply
to
our
thinking
is
not
doubtful
an
order
is
contingent
and
seems
so
in
relation
to
the
inverse
order
as
verse
is
contingent
in
relation
to
prose
and
prose
in
relation
to
verse
but
just
as
all
speech
which
is
not
prose
is
verse
and
necessarily
conceived
as
verse
just
as
all
speech
which
is
not
verse
is
prose
and
necessarily
conceived
as
prose
so
any
state
of
things
that
is
not
one
of
the
two
orders
is
the
other
and
is
necessarily
conceived
as
the
other
but
it
may
happen
that
we
do
not
realize
what
we
are
actually
thinking
of
and
perceive
the
idea
really
present
to
our
mind
only
through
a
mist
of
affective
states
any
one
can
be
convinced
of
this
by
considering
the
use
we
make
of
the
idea
of
disorder
in
daily
life
when
i
enter
a
room
and
pronounce
it
to
be
in
disorder
what
do
i
mean
the
position
of
each
object
is
explained
by
the
automatic
movements
of
the
person
who
has
slept
in
the
room
or
by
the
efficient
causes
whatever
they
may
be
that
have
caused
each
article
of
furniture
clothing
to
be
where
it
is
the
order
in
the
second
sense
of
the
word
is
perfect
but
it
is
order
of
the
first
kind
that
i
am
expecting
the
order
that
a
methodical
person
consciously
puts
into
his
life
the
willed
order
and
not
the
automatic
so
i
call
the
absence
of
this
order
disorder
at
bottom
all
there
is
that
is
real
perceived
and
even
conceived
in
this
absence
of
one
of
the
two
kinds
of
order
is
the
presence
of
the
other
but
the
second
is
indifferent
to
me
am
interested
only
in
the
and
i
express
the
presence
of
the
second
as
a
function
of
the
first
instead
of
expressing
it
so
to
speak
as
a
function
of
itself
by
saying
it
is
inversely
when
we
affirm
that
we
are
imagining
a
chaos
that
is
to
say
a
state
of
things
in
which
the
physical
world
no
longer
obeys
laws
what
are
we
thinking
of
we
imagine
facts
that
appear
and
disappear
first
we
think
of
the
physical
universe
as
we
know
it
with
effects
and
causes
well
proportioned
to
each
other
then
by
a
series
of
arbitrary
decrees
we
augment
diminish
suppress
so
as
to
obtain
what
we
call
disorder
in
reality
we
have
substituted
for
the
mechanism
of
nature
we
have
replaced
the
automatic
order
by
a
multitude
of
elementary
wills
just
to
the
extent
that
we
imagine
the
apparition
or
vanishing
of
phenomena
no
doubt
for
all
these
little
wills
to
constitute
a
willed
order
they
must
have
accepted
the
direction
of
a
higher
will
but
on
looking
closely
at
them
we
see
that
that
is
just
what
they
do
our
own
will
is
there
which
objectifies
itself
in
each
of
these
capricious
wills
in
turn
and
takes
good
care
not
to
connect
the
same
with
the
same
nor
to
permit
the
effect
to
be
proportional
to
the
cause
in
fact
makes
one
simple
intention
hover
over
the
whole
of
the
elementary
volitions
thus
here
again
the
absence
of
one
of
the
two
orders
consists
in
the
presence
of
the
other
in
analyzing
the
idea
of
chance
which
is
closely
akin
to
the
idea
of
disorder
we
find
the
same
elements
when
the
wholly
mechanical
play
of
the
causes
which
stop
the
wheel
on
a
number
makes
me
win
and
consequently
acts
like
a
good
genius
careful
of
my
interests
or
when
the
wholly
mechanical
force
of
the
wind
tears
a
tile
off
the
roof
and
throws
it
on
to
my
head
that
is
to
say
acts
like
a
bad
genius
conspiring
against
my
person
in
both
cases
i
find
a
mechanism
where
i
should
have
looked
for
where
indeed
it
seems
as
if
i
ought
to
have
found
an
intention
that
is
what
i
express
in
speaking
of
and
of
an
anarchical
world
in
which
phenomena
succeed
each
other
capriciously
i
should
say
again
that
it
is
a
realm
of
chance
meaning
that
i
find
before
me
wills
or
rather
when
what
i
am
expecting
is
mechanism
thus
is
explained
the
singular
vacillation
of
the
mind
when
it
tries
to
define
chance
neither
efficient
cause
nor
final
cause
can
furnish
the
definition
sought
the
mind
swings
to
and
fro
unable
to
rest
between
the
idea
of
an
absence
of
final
cause
and
that
of
an
absence
of
efficient
cause
each
of
these
definitions
sending
it
back
to
the
other
the
problem
remains
insoluble
in
fact
so
long
as
the
idea
of
chance
is
regarded
as
a
pure
idea
without
mixture
of
feeling
but
in
reality
chance
merely
objectifies
the
state
of
mind
of
one
who
expecting
one
of
the
two
kinds
of
order
finds
himself
confronted
with
the
other
chance
and
disorder
are
therefore
necessarily
conceived
as
relative
so
if
we
wish
to
represent
them
to
ourselves
as
absolute
we
perceive
that
we
are
going
to
and
fro
like
a
shuttle
between
the
two
kinds
of
order
passing
into
the
one
just
at
the
moment
at
which
we
might
catch
ourself
in
the
other
and
that
the
supposed
absence
of
all
order
is
really
the
presence
of
both
with
besides
the
swaying
of
a
mind
that
can
not
rest
finally
in
either
neither
in
things
nor
in
our
idea
of
things
can
there
be
any
question
of
presenting
this
disorder
as
the
substratum
of
order
since
it
implies
the
two
kinds
of
order
and
is
made
of
their
combination
but
our
intelligence
is
not
stopped
by
this
by
a
simple
it
posits
a
disorder
which
is
an
absence
of
order
in
so
doing
it
thinks
a
word
or
a
set
of
words
nothing
more
if
it
seeks
to
attach
an
idea
to
the
word
it
finds
that
disorder
may
indeed
be
the
negation
of
order
but
that
this
negation
is
then
the
implicit
affirmation
of
the
presence
of
the
opposite
order
which
we
shut
our
eyes
to
because
it
does
not
interest
us
or
which
we
evade
by
denying
the
second
order
in
its
turn
that
is
at
bottom
by
the
first
how
can
we
speak
then
of
an
incoherent
diversity
which
an
understanding
organizes
it
is
no
use
for
us
to
say
that
no
one
supposes
this
incoherence
to
be
realized
or
realizable
when
we
speak
of
it
we
believe
we
are
thinking
of
it
now
in
analyzing
the
idea
actually
present
we
find
as
we
said
before
only
the
disappointment
of
the
mind
confronted
with
an
order
that
does
not
interest
it
or
a
swaying
of
the
mind
between
two
kinds
of
order
or
finally
the
idea
pure
and
simple
of
the
empty
word
that
we
have
created
by
joining
a
negative
prefix
to
a
word
which
itself
signifies
something
but
it
is
this
analysis
that
we
neglect
to
make
we
omit
it
precisely
because
it
does
not
occur
to
us
to
distinguish
two
kinds
of
order
that
are
irreducible
to
one
another
we
said
indeed
that
all
order
necessarily
appears
as
contingent
if
there
are
two
kinds
of
order
this
contingency
of
order
is
explained
one
of
the
forms
is
contingent
in
relation
to
the
other
where
i
find
the
geometrical
order
the
vital
was
possible
where
the
order
is
vital
it
might
have
been
geometrical
but
suppose
that
the
order
is
everywhere
of
the
same
kind
and
simply
admits
of
degrees
which
go
from
the
geometrical
to
the
vital
if
a
determinate
order
still
appears
to
me
to
be
contingent
and
can
no
longer
be
so
by
relation
to
an
order
of
another
kind
i
shall
necessarily
believe
that
the
order
is
contingent
by
relation
to
an
of
that
is
to
say
by
relation
to
a
state
of
things
in
which
there
is
no
order
at
all
and
this
state
of
things
i
shall
believe
that
i
am
thinking
of
because
it
is
implied
it
seems
in
the
very
contingency
of
order
which
is
an
unquestionable
fact
i
shall
therefore
place
at
the
summit
of
the
hierarchy
the
vital
order
then
as
a
diminution
or
lower
complication
of
it
the
geometrical
order
and
finally
at
the
bottom
of
all
an
absence
of
order
incoherence
itself
on
which
order
is
superposed
this
is
why
incoherence
has
the
effect
on
me
of
a
word
behind
which
there
must
be
something
real
if
not
in
things
at
least
in
thought
but
if
i
observe
that
the
state
of
things
implied
by
the
contingency
of
a
determinate
order
is
simply
the
presence
of
the
contrary
order
and
if
by
this
very
fact
i
posit
two
kinds
of
order
each
the
inverse
of
the
other
i
perceive
that
no
intermediate
degrees
can
be
imagined
between
the
two
orders
and
that
there
is
no
going
down
from
the
two
orders
to
the
incoherent
either
the
incoherent
is
only
a
word
devoid
of
meaning
or
if
i
give
it
a
meaning
it
is
on
condition
of
putting
incoherence
midway
between
the
two
orders
and
not
below
both
of
them
there
is
not
first
the
incoherent
then
the
geometrical
then
the
vital
there
is
only
the
geometrical
and
the
vital
and
then
by
a
swaying
of
the
mind
between
them
the
idea
of
the
incoherent
to
speak
of
an
uncoördinated
diversity
to
which
order
is
superadded
is
therefore
to
commit
a
veritable
for
in
imagining
the
uncoördinated
we
really
posit
an
order
or
rather
two
this
long
analysis
was
necessary
to
show
how
the
real
can
pass
from
tension
to
extension
and
from
freedom
to
mechanical
necessity
by
way
of
inversion
it
was
not
enough
to
prove
that
this
relation
between
the
two
terms
is
suggested
to
us
at
once
by
consciousness
and
by
sensible
experience
it
was
necessary
to
prove
that
the
geometrical
order
has
no
need
of
explanation
being
purely
and
simply
the
suppression
of
the
inverse
order
and
for
that
it
was
indispensable
to
prove
that
suppression
is
always
a
substitution
and
is
even
necessarily
conceived
as
such
it
is
the
requirements
of
practical
life
alone
that
suggest
to
us
here
a
way
of
speaking
that
deceives
us
both
as
to
what
happens
in
things
and
as
to
what
is
present
to
our
thought
we
must
now
examine
more
closely
the
inversion
whose
consequences
we
have
just
described
what
then
is
the
principle
that
has
only
to
let
go
its
tension
may
we
say
to
in
order
to
the
interruption
of
the
cause
here
being
equivalent
to
a
reversal
of
the
effect
for
want
of
a
better
word
we
have
called
it
consciousness
but
we
do
not
mean
the
narrowed
consciousness
that
functions
in
each
of
us
our
own
consciousness
is
the
consciousness
of
a
certain
living
being
placed
in
a
certain
point
of
space
and
though
it
does
indeed
move
in
the
same
direction
as
its
principle
it
is
continually
drawn
the
opposite
way
obliged
though
it
goes
forward
to
look
behind
this
retrospective
vision
is
as
we
have
shown
the
natural
function
of
the
intellect
and
consequently
of
distinct
consciousness
in
order
that
our
consciousness
shall
coincide
with
something
of
its
principle
it
must
detach
itself
from
the
and
attach
itself
to
the
it
needs
that
turning
back
on
itself
and
twisting
on
itself
the
faculty
of
should
be
made
to
be
one
with
the
act
of
a
painful
effort
which
we
can
make
suddenly
doing
violence
to
our
nature
but
can
not
sustain
more
than
a
few
moments
in
free
action
when
we
contract
our
whole
being
in
order
to
thrust
it
forward
we
have
the
more
or
less
clear
consciousness
of
motives
and
of
impelling
forces
and
even
at
rare
moments
of
the
becoming
by
which
they
are
organized
into
an
act
but
the
pure
willing
the
current
that
runs
through
this
matter
communicating
life
to
it
is
a
thing
which
we
hardly
feel
which
at
most
we
brush
lightly
as
it
passes
let
us
try
however
to
instal
ourselves
within
it
if
only
for
a
moment
even
then
it
is
an
individual
and
fragmentary
will
that
we
grasp
to
get
to
the
principle
of
all
life
as
also
of
all
materiality
we
must
go
further
still
is
it
impossible
no
by
no
means
the
history
of
philosophy
is
there
to
bear
witness
there
is
no
durable
system
that
is
not
at
least
in
some
of
its
parts
vivified
by
intuition
dialectic
is
necessary
to
put
intuition
to
the
proof
necessary
also
in
order
that
intuition
should
break
itself
up
into
concepts
and
so
be
propagated
to
other
men
but
all
it
does
often
enough
is
to
develop
the
result
of
that
intuition
which
transcends
it
the
truth
is
the
two
procedures
are
of
opposite
direction
the
same
effort
by
which
ideas
are
connected
with
ideas
causes
the
intuition
which
the
ideas
were
storing
up
to
vanish
the
philosopher
is
obliged
to
abandon
intuition
once
he
has
received
from
it
the
impetus
and
to
rely
on
himself
to
carry
on
the
movement
by
pushing
the
concepts
one
after
another
but
he
soon
feels
he
has
lost
foothold
he
must
come
into
touch
with
intuition
again
he
must
undo
most
of
what
he
has
done
in
short
dialectic
is
what
ensures
the
agreement
of
our
thought
with
itself
but
by
dialectic
which
is
only
a
relaxation
of
intuition
many
different
agreements
are
possible
while
there
is
only
one
truth
intuition
if
it
could
be
prolonged
beyond
a
few
instants
would
not
only
make
the
philosopher
agree
with
his
own
thought
but
also
all
philosophers
with
each
other
such
as
it
is
fugitive
and
incomplete
it
is
in
each
system
what
is
worth
more
than
the
system
and
survives
it
the
object
of
philosophy
would
be
reached
if
this
intuition
could
be
sustained
generalized
and
above
all
assured
of
external
points
of
reference
in
order
not
to
go
astray
to
that
end
a
continual
coming
and
going
is
necessary
between
nature
and
mind
when
we
put
back
our
being
into
our
will
and
our
will
itself
into
the
impulsion
it
prolongs
we
understand
we
feel
that
reality
is
a
perpetual
growth
a
creation
pursued
without
end
our
will
already
performs
this
miracle
every
human
work
in
which
there
is
invention
every
voluntary
act
in
which
there
is
freedom
every
movement
of
an
organism
that
manifests
spontaneity
brings
something
new
into
the
world
true
these
are
only
creations
of
form
how
could
they
be
anything
else
we
are
not
the
vital
current
itself
we
are
this
current
already
loaded
with
matter
that
is
with
congealed
parts
of
its
own
substance
which
it
carries
along
its
course
in
the
composition
of
a
work
of
genius
as
in
a
simple
free
decision
we
do
indeed
stretch
the
spring
of
our
activity
to
the
utmost
and
thus
create
what
no
mere
assemblage
of
materials
could
have
given
what
assemblage
of
curves
already
known
can
ever
be
equivalent
to
the
of
a
great
artist
but
there
are
none
the
less
elements
here
that
and
survive
their
organization
but
if
a
simple
arrest
of
the
action
that
generates
form
could
constitute
matter
are
not
the
original
lines
drawn
by
the
artist
themselves
already
the
fixation
and
as
it
were
congealment
of
a
movement
a
creation
of
matter
would
be
neither
incomprehensible
nor
inadmissible
for
we
seize
from
within
we
live
at
every
instant
a
creation
of
form
and
it
is
just
in
those
cases
in
which
the
form
is
pure
and
in
which
the
creative
current
is
momentarily
interrupted
that
there
is
a
creation
of
matter
consider
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
that
enter
into
the
composition
of
everything
that
has
ever
been
written
we
do
not
conceive
that
new
letters
spring
up
and
come
to
join
themselves
to
the
others
in
order
to
make
a
new
poem
but
that
the
poet
creates
the
poem
and
that
human
thought
is
thereby
made
richer
we
understand
very
well
this
creation
is
a
simple
act
of
the
mind
and
action
has
only
to
make
a
pause
instead
of
continuing
into
a
new
creation
in
order
that
of
itself
it
may
break
up
into
words
which
dissociate
themselves
into
letters
which
are
added
to
all
the
letters
there
are
already
in
the
world
thus
that
the
number
of
atoms
composing
the
material
universe
at
a
given
moment
should
increase
runs
counter
to
our
habits
of
mind
contradicts
the
whole
of
our
experience
but
that
a
reality
of
quite
another
order
which
contrasts
with
the
atom
as
the
thought
of
the
poet
with
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
should
increase
by
sudden
additions
is
not
inadmissible
and
the
reverse
of
each
addition
might
indeed
be
a
world
which
we
then
represent
to
ourselves
symbolically
as
an
assemblage
of
atoms
the
mystery
that
spreads
over
the
existence
of
the
universe
comes
in
great
part
from
this
that
we
want
the
genesis
of
it
to
have
been
accomplished
at
one
stroke
or
the
whole
of
matter
to
be
eternal
whether
we
speak
of
creation
or
posit
an
uncreated
matter
it
is
the
totality
of
the
universe
that
we
are
considering
at
once
at
the
root
of
this
habit
of
mind
lies
the
prejudice
which
we
will
analyze
in
our
next
chapter
the
idea
common
to
materialists
and
to
their
opponents
that
there
is
no
really
acting
duration
and
that
the
absolute
matter
or
mind
can
have
no
place
in
concrete
time
in
the
time
which
we
feel
to
be
the
very
stuff
of
our
life
from
which
it
follows
that
everything
is
given
once
for
all
and
that
it
is
necessary
to
posit
from
all
eternity
either
material
multiplicity
itself
or
the
act
creating
this
multiplicity
given
in
block
in
the
divine
essence
once
this
prejudice
is
eradicated
the
idea
of
creation
becomes
more
clear
for
it
is
merged
in
that
of
growth
but
it
is
no
longer
then
of
the
universe
in
its
totality
that
we
must
speak
why
should
we
speak
of
it
the
universe
is
an
assemblage
of
solar
systems
which
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
analogous
to
our
own
no
doubt
they
are
not
absolutely
independent
of
one
another
our
sun
radiates
heat
and
light
beyond
the
farthest
planet
and
on
the
other
hand
our
entire
solar
system
is
moving
in
a
definite
direction
as
if
it
were
drawn
there
is
then
a
bond
between
the
worlds
but
this
bond
may
be
regarded
as
infinitely
loose
in
comparison
with
the
mutual
dependence
which
unites
the
parts
of
the
same
world
among
themselves
so
that
it
is
not
artificially
for
reasons
of
mere
convenience
that
we
isolate
our
solar
system
nature
itself
invites
us
to
isolate
it
as
living
beings
we
depend
on
the
planet
on
which
we
are
and
on
the
sun
that
provides
for
it
but
on
nothing
else
as
thinking
beings
we
may
apply
the
laws
of
our
physics
to
our
own
world
and
extend
them
to
each
of
the
worlds
taken
separately
but
nothing
tells
us
that
they
apply
to
the
entire
universe
nor
even
that
such
an
affirmation
has
any
meaning
for
the
universe
is
not
made
but
is
being
made
continually
it
is
growing
perhaps
indefinitely
by
the
addition
of
new
worlds
let
us
extend
then
to
the
whole
of
our
solar
system
the
two
most
general
laws
of
our
science
the
principle
of
conservation
of
energy
and
that
of
its
degradation
limiting
them
however
to
this
relatively
closed
system
and
to
other
systems
relatively
closed
let
us
see
what
will
follow
we
must
remark
first
of
all
that
these
two
principles
have
not
the
same
metaphysical
scope
the
first
is
a
quantitative
law
and
consequently
relative
in
part
to
our
methods
of
measurement
it
says
that
in
a
system
presumed
to
be
closed
the
total
energy
that
is
to
say
the
sum
of
its
kinetic
and
potential
energy
remains
constant
now
if
there
were
only
kinetic
energy
in
the
world
or
even
if
there
were
besides
kinetic
energy
only
one
single
kind
of
potential
energy
but
no
more
the
artifice
of
measurement
would
not
make
the
law
artificial
the
law
of
the
conservation
of
energy
would
express
indeed
that
is
preserved
in
constant
quantity
but
there
are
in
fact
energies
of
various
kinds
and
the
measurement
of
each
of
them
has
evidently
been
so
chosen
as
to
justify
the
principle
of
conservation
of
energy
convention
therefore
plays
a
large
part
in
this
principle
although
there
is
undoubtedly
between
the
variations
of
the
different
energies
composing
one
and
the
same
system
a
mutual
dependence
which
is
just
what
has
made
the
extension
of
the
principle
possible
by
measurements
suitably
chosen
if
therefore
the
philosopher
applies
this
principle
to
the
solar
system
complete
he
must
at
least
soften
its
outlines
the
law
of
the
conservation
of
energy
can
not
here
express
the
objective
permanence
of
a
certain
quantity
of
a
certain
thing
but
rather
the
necessity
for
every
change
that
is
brought
about
to
be
counterbalanced
in
some
way
by
a
change
in
an
opposite
direction
that
is
to
say
even
if
it
governs
the
whole
of
our
solar
system
the
law
of
the
conservation
of
energy
is
concerned
with
the
relationship
of
a
fragment
of
this
world
to
another
fragment
rather
than
with
the
nature
of
the
whole
it
is
otherwise
with
the
second
principle
of
thermodynamics
the
law
of
the
degradation
of
energy
does
not
bear
essentially
on
magnitudes
no
doubt
the
first
idea
of
it
arose
in
the
thought
of
carnot
out
of
certain
quantitative
considerations
on
the
yield
of
thermic
machines
unquestionably
too
the
terms
in
which
clausius
generalized
it
were
mathematical
and
a
calculable
magnitude
entropy
was
in
fact
the
final
conception
to
which
he
was
led
such
precision
is
necessary
for
practical
applications
but
the
law
might
have
been
vaguely
conceived
and
if
absolutely
necessary
it
might
have
been
roughly
formulated
even
though
no
one
had
ever
thought
of
measuring
the
different
energies
of
the
physical
world
even
though
the
concept
of
energy
had
not
been
created
essentially
it
expresses
the
fact
that
all
physical
changes
have
a
tendency
to
be
degraded
into
heat
and
that
heat
tends
to
be
distributed
among
bodies
in
a
uniform
manner
in
this
less
precise
form
it
becomes
independent
of
any
convention
it
is
the
most
metaphysical
of
the
laws
of
physics
since
it
points
out
without
interposed
symbols
without
artificial
devices
of
measurements
the
direction
in
which
the
world
is
going
it
tells
us
that
changes
that
are
visible
and
heterogeneous
will
be
more
and
more
diluted
into
changes
that
are
invisible
and
homogeneous
and
that
the
instability
to
which
we
owe
the
richness
and
variety
of
the
changes
taking
place
in
our
solar
system
will
gradually
give
way
to
the
relative
stability
of
elementary
vibrations
continually
and
perpetually
repeated
just
so
with
a
man
who
keeps
up
his
strength
as
he
grows
old
but
spends
it
less
and
less
in
actions
and
comes
in
the
end
to
employ
it
entirely
in
making
his
lungs
breathe
and
his
heart
beat
from
this
point
of
view
a
world
like
our
solar
system
is
seen
to
be
ever
exhausting
something
of
the
mutability
it
contains
in
the
beginning
it
had
the
maximum
of
possible
utilization
of
energy
this
mutability
has
gone
on
diminishing
unceasingly
whence
does
it
come
we
might
at
first
suppose
that
it
has
come
from
some
other
point
of
space
but
the
difficulty
is
only
set
back
and
for
this
external
source
of
mutability
the
same
question
springs
up
true
it
might
be
added
that
the
number
of
worlds
capable
of
passing
mutability
to
each
other
is
unlimited
that
the
sum
of
mutability
contained
in
the
universe
is
infinite
that
there
is
therefore
no
ground
on
which
to
seek
its
origin
or
to
foresee
its
end
a
hypothesis
of
this
kind
is
as
irrefutable
as
it
is
indemonstrable
but
to
speak
of
an
infinite
universe
is
to
admit
a
perfect
coincidence
of
matter
with
abstract
space
and
consequently
an
absolute
externality
of
all
the
parts
of
matter
in
relation
to
one
another
we
have
seen
above
what
we
must
think
of
this
theory
and
how
difficult
it
is
to
reconcile
with
the
idea
of
a
reciprocal
influence
of
all
the
parts
of
matter
on
one
another
an
influence
to
which
indeed
it
itself
makes
appeal
again
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
general
instability
has
arisen
from
a
general
state
of
stability
that
the
period
in
which
we
now
are
and
in
which
the
utilizable
energy
is
diminishing
has
been
preceded
by
a
period
in
which
the
mutability
was
increasing
and
that
the
alternations
of
increase
and
diminution
succeed
each
other
for
ever
this
hypothesis
is
theoretically
conceivable
as
has
been
demonstrated
quite
recently
but
according
to
the
calculations
of
boltzmann
the
mathematical
improbability
of
it
passes
all
imagination
and
practically
amounts
to
absolute
impossibility
in
reality
the
problem
remains
insoluble
as
long
as
we
keep
on
the
ground
of
physics
for
the
physicist
is
obliged
to
attach
energy
to
extended
particles
and
even
if
he
regards
the
particles
only
as
reservoirs
of
energy
he
remains
in
space
he
would
belie
his
rôle
if
he
sought
the
origin
of
these
energies
in
an
process
it
is
there
however
in
our
opinion
that
it
must
be
sought
is
it
extension
in
general
that
we
are
considering
we
said
appears
only
as
a
which
is
interrupted
or
are
we
considering
the
concrete
reality
that
fills
this
extension
the
order
which
reigns
there
and
which
is
manifested
by
the
laws
of
nature
is
an
order
which
must
be
born
of
itself
when
the
inverse
order
is
suppressed
a
detension
of
the
will
would
produce
precisely
this
suppression
lastly
we
find
that
the
direction
which
this
reality
takes
suggests
to
us
the
idea
of
a
thing
such
no
doubt
is
one
of
the
essential
characters
of
materiality
what
conclusion
are
we
to
draw
from
all
this
if
not
that
the
process
by
which
this
thing
is
directed
in
a
contrary
way
to
that
of
physical
processes
and
that
it
is
therefore
by
its
very
definition
immaterial
the
vision
we
have
of
the
material
world
is
that
of
a
weight
which
falls
no
image
drawn
from
matter
properly
so
called
will
ever
give
us
the
idea
of
the
weight
rising
but
this
conclusion
will
come
home
to
us
with
still
greater
force
if
we
press
nearer
to
the
concrete
reality
and
if
we
consider
no
longer
only
matter
in
general
but
within
this
matter
living
bodies
all
our
analyses
show
us
in
life
an
effort
to
remount
the
incline
that
matter
descends
in
that
they
reveal
to
us
the
possibility
the
necessity
even
of
a
process
the
inverse
of
materiality
creative
of
matter
by
its
interruption
alone
the
life
that
evolves
on
the
surface
of
our
planet
is
indeed
attached
to
matter
if
it
were
pure
consciousness
if
it
were
it
would
be
pure
creative
activity
in
fact
it
is
riveted
to
an
organism
that
subjects
it
to
the
general
laws
of
inert
matter
but
everything
happens
as
if
it
were
doing
its
utmost
to
set
itself
free
from
these
laws
it
has
not
the
power
to
reverse
the
direction
of
physical
changes
such
as
the
principle
of
carnot
determines
it
it
does
however
behave
absolutely
as
a
force
would
behave
which
left
to
itself
would
work
in
the
inverse
direction
incapable
of
the
course
of
material
changes
downwards
it
succeeds
in
it
the
evolution
of
life
really
continues
as
we
have
shown
an
initial
impulsion
this
impulsion
which
has
determined
the
development
of
the
chlorophyllian
function
in
the
plant
and
of
the
system
in
the
animal
brings
life
to
more
and
more
efficient
acts
by
the
fabrication
and
use
of
more
and
more
powerful
explosives
now
what
do
these
explosives
represent
if
not
a
of
the
solar
energy
the
degradation
of
which
energy
is
thus
provisionally
suspended
on
some
of
the
points
where
it
was
being
poured
forth
the
usable
energy
which
the
explosive
conceals
will
be
expended
of
course
at
the
moment
of
the
explosion
but
it
would
have
been
expended
sooner
if
an
organism
had
not
happened
to
be
there
to
arrest
its
dissipation
in
order
to
retain
it
and
save
it
up
as
we
see
it
at
the
point
to
which
it
was
brought
by
a
scission
of
the
mutually
complementary
tendencies
which
it
contained
within
itself
life
is
entirely
dependent
on
the
chlorophyllian
function
of
the
plant
this
means
that
looked
at
in
its
initial
impulsion
before
any
scission
life
was
a
tendency
to
accumulate
in
a
reservoir
as
do
especially
the
green
parts
of
vegetables
with
a
view
to
an
instantaneous
effective
discharge
like
that
which
an
animal
brings
about
something
that
would
have
otherwise
flowed
away
it
is
like
an
effort
to
raise
the
weight
which
falls
true
it
succeeds
only
in
retarding
the
fall
but
at
least
it
can
give
us
an
idea
of
what
the
raising
of
the
weight
was
let
us
imagine
a
vessel
full
of
steam
at
a
high
pressure
and
here
and
there
in
its
sides
a
crack
through
which
the
steam
is
escaping
in
a
jet
the
steam
thrown
into
the
air
is
nearly
all
condensed
into
little
drops
which
fall
back
and
this
condensation
and
this
fall
represent
simply
the
loss
of
something
an
interruption
a
deficit
but
a
small
part
of
the
jet
of
steam
subsists
uncondensed
for
some
seconds
it
is
making
an
effort
to
raise
the
drops
which
are
falling
it
succeeds
at
most
in
retarding
their
fall
so
from
an
immense
reservoir
of
life
jets
must
be
gushing
out
unceasingly
of
which
each
falling
back
is
a
world
the
evolution
of
living
species
within
this
world
represents
what
subsists
of
the
primitive
direction
of
the
original
jet
and
of
an
impulsion
which
continues
itself
in
a
direction
the
inverse
of
materiality
but
let
us
not
carry
too
far
this
comparison
it
gives
us
but
a
feeble
and
even
deceptive
image
of
reality
for
the
crack
the
jet
of
steam
the
forming
of
the
drops
are
determined
necessarily
whereas
the
creation
of
a
world
is
a
free
act
and
the
life
within
the
material
world
participates
in
this
liberty
let
us
think
rather
of
an
action
like
that
of
raising
the
arm
then
let
us
suppose
that
the
arm
left
to
itself
falls
back
and
yet
that
there
subsists
in
it
striving
to
raise
it
up
again
something
of
the
will
that
animates
it
in
this
image
of
a
action
which
unmakes
we
have
already
a
more
exact
representation
of
matter
in
vital
activity
we
see
then
that
which
subsists
of
the
direct
movement
in
the
inverted
movement
reality
which
is
making
itself
in
a
reality
which
is
unmaking
everything
is
obscure
in
the
idea
of
creation
if
we
think
of
which
are
created
and
a
which
creates
as
we
habitually
do
as
the
understanding
can
not
help
doing
we
shall
show
the
origin
of
this
illusion
in
our
next
chapter
it
is
natural
to
our
intellect
whose
function
is
essentially
practical
made
to
present
to
us
things
and
states
rather
than
changes
and
acts
but
things
and
states
are
only
views
taken
by
our
mind
of
becoming
there
are
no
things
there
are
only
actions
more
particularly
if
i
consider
the
world
in
which
we
live
i
find
that
the
automatic
and
strictly
determined
evolution
of
this
whole
is
action
which
is
unmaking
itself
and
that
the
unforeseen
forms
which
life
cuts
out
in
it
forms
capable
of
being
themselves
prolonged
into
unforeseen
movements
represent
the
action
that
is
making
itself
now
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
other
worlds
are
analogous
to
ours
that
things
happen
there
in
the
same
way
and
i
know
they
were
not
all
constructed
at
the
same
time
since
observation
shows
me
even
nebulae
in
course
of
concentration
now
if
the
same
kind
of
action
is
going
on
everywhere
whether
it
is
that
which
is
unmaking
itself
or
whether
it
is
that
which
is
striving
to
remake
itself
i
simply
express
this
probable
similitude
when
i
speak
of
a
centre
from
which
worlds
shoot
out
like
rockets
in
a
fireworks
display
provided
however
that
i
do
not
present
this
centre
as
a
but
as
a
continuity
of
shooting
out
god
thus
defined
has
nothing
of
the
already
made
he
is
unceasing
life
action
freedom
creation
so
conceived
is
not
a
mystery
we
experience
it
in
ourselves
when
we
act
freely
that
new
things
can
join
things
already
existing
is
absurd
no
doubt
since
the
results
from
a
solidification
performed
by
our
understanding
and
there
are
never
any
things
other
than
those
that
the
understanding
has
thus
constituted
to
speak
of
things
creating
themselves
would
therefore
amount
to
saying
that
the
understanding
presents
to
itself
more
than
it
presents
to
itself
a
affirmation
an
empty
and
vain
idea
but
that
action
increases
as
it
goes
on
that
it
creates
in
the
measure
of
its
advance
is
what
each
of
us
finds
when
he
watches
himself
act
things
are
constituted
by
the
instantaneous
cut
which
the
understanding
practices
at
a
given
moment
on
a
flux
of
this
kind
and
what
is
mysterious
when
we
compare
the
cuts
together
becomes
clear
when
we
relate
them
to
the
flux
indeed
the
modalities
of
creative
action
in
so
far
as
it
is
still
going
on
in
the
organization
of
living
forms
are
much
simplified
when
they
are
taken
in
this
way
before
the
complexity
of
an
organism
and
the
practically
infinite
multitude
of
interwoven
analyses
and
syntheses
it
presupposes
our
understanding
recoils
disconcerted
that
the
simple
play
of
physical
and
chemical
forces
left
to
themselves
should
have
worked
this
marvel
we
find
hard
to
believe
and
if
it
is
a
profound
science
which
is
at
work
how
are
we
to
understand
the
influence
exercised
on
this
matter
without
form
by
this
form
without
matter
but
the
difficulty
arises
from
this
that
we
represent
statically
material
particles
juxtaposed
to
one
another
and
also
statically
an
external
cause
which
plasters
upon
them
a
skilfully
contrived
organization
in
reality
life
is
a
movement
materiality
is
the
inverse
movement
and
each
of
these
two
movements
is
simple
the
matter
which
forms
a
world
being
an
undivided
flux
and
undivided
also
the
life
that
runs
through
it
cutting
out
in
it
living
beings
all
along
its
track
of
these
two
currents
the
second
runs
counter
to
the
first
but
the
first
obtains
all
the
same
something
from
the
second
there
results
between
them
a
which
is
organization
this
organization
takes
for
our
senses
and
for
our
intellect
the
form
of
parts
entirely
external
to
other
parts
in
space
and
in
time
not
only
do
we
shut
our
eyes
to
the
unity
of
the
impulse
which
passing
through
generations
links
individuals
with
individuals
species
with
species
and
makes
of
the
whole
series
of
the
living
one
single
immense
wave
flowing
over
matter
but
each
individual
itself
seems
to
us
as
an
aggregate
aggregate
of
molecules
and
aggregate
of
facts
the
reason
of
this
lies
in
the
structure
of
our
intellect
which
is
formed
to
act
on
matter
from
without
and
which
succeeds
by
making
in
the
flux
of
the
real
instantaneous
cuts
each
of
which
becomes
in
its
fixity
endlessly
decomposable
perceiving
in
an
organism
only
parts
external
to
parts
the
understanding
has
the
choice
between
two
systems
of
explanation
only
either
to
regard
the
infinitely
complex
and
thereby
infinitely
organization
as
a
fortuitous
concatenation
of
atoms
or
to
relate
it
to
the
incomprehensible
influence
of
an
external
force
that
has
grouped
its
elements
together
but
this
complexity
is
the
work
of
the
understanding
this
incomprehensibility
is
also
its
work
let
us
try
to
see
no
longer
with
the
eyes
of
the
intellect
alone
which
grasps
only
the
already
made
and
which
looks
from
the
outside
but
with
the
spirit
i
mean
with
that
faculty
of
seeing
which
is
immanent
in
the
faculty
of
acting
and
which
springs
up
somehow
by
the
twisting
of
the
will
on
itself
when
action
is
turned
into
knowledge
like
heat
so
to
say
into
light
to
movement
then
everything
will
be
restored
and
into
movement
everything
will
be
resolved
where
the
understanding
working
on
the
image
supposed
to
be
fixed
of
the
progressing
action
shows
us
parts
infinitely
manifold
and
an
order
infinitely
well
contrived
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
simple
process
an
action
which
is
making
itself
across
an
action
of
the
same
kind
which
is
unmaking
itself
like
the
fiery
path
torn
by
the
last
rocket
of
a
fireworks
display
through
the
black
cinders
of
the
spent
rockets
that
are
falling
dead
from
this
point
of
view
the
general
considerations
we
have
presented
concerning
the
evolution
of
life
will
be
cleared
up
and
completed
we
will
distinguish
more
sharply
what
is
accidental
from
what
is
essential
in
this
evolution
the
impetus
of
life
of
which
we
are
speaking
consists
in
a
need
of
creation
it
can
not
create
absolutely
because
it
is
confronted
with
matter
that
is
to
say
with
the
movement
that
is
the
inverse
of
its
own
but
it
seizes
upon
this
matter
which
is
necessity
itself
and
strives
to
introduce
into
it
the
largest
possible
amount
of
indetermination
and
liberty
how
does
it
go
to
work
an
animal
high
in
the
scale
may
be
represented
in
a
general
way
we
said
as
a
nervous
system
imposed
on
digestive
respiratory
circulatory
systems
etc
the
function
of
these
latter
is
to
cleanse
repair
and
protect
the
nervous
system
to
make
it
as
independent
as
possible
of
external
circumstances
but
above
all
to
furnish
it
with
energy
to
be
expended
in
movements
the
increasing
complexity
of
the
organism
is
therefore
due
theoretically
in
spite
of
innumerable
exceptions
due
to
accidents
of
evolution
to
the
necessity
of
complexity
in
the
nervous
system
no
doubt
each
complication
of
any
part
of
the
organism
involves
many
others
in
addition
because
this
part
itself
must
live
and
every
change
in
one
point
of
the
body
reverberates
as
it
were
throughout
the
complication
may
therefore
go
on
to
infinity
in
all
directions
but
it
is
the
complication
of
the
nervous
system
which
conditions
the
others
in
right
if
not
always
in
fact
now
in
what
does
the
progress
of
the
nervous
system
itself
consist
in
a
simultaneous
development
of
automatic
activity
and
of
voluntary
activity
the
first
furnishing
the
second
with
an
appropriate
instrument
thus
in
an
organism
such
as
ours
a
considerable
number
of
motor
mechanisms
are
set
up
in
the
medulla
and
in
the
spinal
cord
awaiting
only
a
signal
to
release
the
corresponding
act
the
will
is
employed
in
some
cases
in
setting
up
the
mechanism
itself
and
in
the
others
in
choosing
the
mechanisms
to
be
released
the
manner
of
combining
them
and
the
moment
of
releasing
them
the
will
of
an
animal
is
the
more
effective
and
the
more
intense
the
greater
the
number
of
the
mechanisms
it
can
choose
from
the
more
complicated
the
switchboard
on
which
all
the
motor
paths
cross
or
in
other
words
the
more
developed
its
brain
thus
the
progress
of
the
nervous
system
assures
to
the
act
increasing
precision
increasing
variety
increasing
efficiency
and
independence
the
organism
behaves
more
and
more
like
a
machine
for
action
which
reconstructs
itself
entirely
for
every
new
act
as
if
it
were
made
of
and
could
at
any
moment
change
the
shape
of
all
its
parts
but
prior
to
the
nervous
system
prior
even
to
the
organism
properly
so
called
already
in
the
undifferentiated
mass
of
the
amoeba
this
essential
property
of
animal
life
is
found
the
amoeba
deforms
itself
in
varying
directions
its
entire
mass
does
what
the
differentiation
of
parts
will
localize
in
a
system
in
the
developed
animal
doing
it
only
in
a
rudimentary
manner
it
is
dispensed
from
the
complexity
of
the
higher
organisms
there
is
no
need
here
of
the
auxiliary
elements
that
pass
on
to
motor
elements
the
energy
to
expend
the
animal
moves
as
a
whole
and
as
a
whole
also
procures
energy
by
means
of
the
organic
substances
it
assimilates
thus
whether
low
or
high
in
the
animal
scale
we
always
find
that
animal
life
consists
in
procuring
a
provision
of
energy
in
expending
it
by
means
of
a
matter
as
supple
as
possible
in
directions
variable
and
unforeseen
now
whence
comes
the
energy
from
the
ingested
food
for
food
is
a
kind
of
explosive
which
needs
only
the
spark
to
discharge
the
energy
it
stores
who
has
made
this
explosive
the
food
may
be
the
flesh
of
an
animal
nourished
on
animals
and
so
on
but
in
the
end
it
is
to
the
vegetable
we
always
come
back
vegetables
alone
gather
in
the
solar
energy
and
the
animals
do
but
borrow
it
from
them
either
directly
or
by
some
passing
it
on
to
others
how
then
has
the
plant
stored
up
this
energy
chiefly
by
the
chlorophyllian
function
a
chemicism
of
which
we
do
not
possess
the
key
and
which
is
probably
unlike
that
of
our
laboratories
the
process
consists
in
using
solar
energy
to
fix
the
carbon
of
carbonic
acid
and
thereby
to
store
this
energy
as
we
should
store
that
of
a
by
employing
him
to
fill
an
elevated
reservoir
the
water
once
brought
up
can
set
in
motion
a
mill
or
a
turbine
as
we
will
and
when
we
will
each
atom
of
carbon
fixed
represents
something
like
the
elevation
of
the
weight
of
water
or
like
the
stretching
of
an
elastic
thread
uniting
the
carbon
to
the
oxygen
in
the
carbonic
acid
the
elastic
is
relaxed
the
weight
falls
back
again
in
short
the
energy
held
in
reserve
is
restored
when
by
a
simple
release
the
carbon
is
permitted
to
rejoin
its
oxygen
so
that
all
life
animal
and
vegetable
seems
in
its
essence
like
an
effort
to
accumulate
energy
and
then
to
let
it
flow
into
flexible
channels
changeable
in
shape
at
the
end
of
which
it
will
accomplish
infinitely
varied
kinds
of
work
that
is
what
the
passing
through
matter
would
fain
do
all
at
once
it
would
succeed
no
doubt
if
its
power
were
unlimited
or
if
some
reinforcement
could
come
to
it
from
without
but
the
impetus
is
finite
and
it
has
been
given
once
for
all
it
can
not
overcome
all
obstacles
the
movement
it
starts
is
sometimes
turned
aside
sometimes
divided
always
opposed
and
the
evolution
of
the
organized
world
is
the
unrolling
of
this
conflict
the
first
great
scission
that
had
to
be
effected
was
that
of
the
two
kingdoms
vegetable
and
animal
which
thus
happen
to
be
mutually
complementary
without
however
any
agreement
having
been
made
between
them
it
is
not
for
the
animal
that
the
plant
accumulates
energy
it
is
for
its
own
consumption
but
its
expenditure
on
itself
is
less
discontinuous
and
less
concentrated
and
therefore
less
efficacious
than
was
required
by
the
initial
impetus
of
life
essentially
directed
toward
free
actions
the
same
organism
could
not
with
equal
force
sustain
the
two
functions
at
once
of
gradual
storage
and
sudden
use
of
themselves
therefore
and
without
any
external
intervention
simply
by
the
effect
of
the
duality
of
the
tendency
involved
in
the
original
impetus
and
of
the
resistance
opposed
by
matter
to
this
impetus
the
organisms
leaned
some
in
the
first
direction
others
in
the
second
to
this
scission
there
succeeded
many
others
hence
the
diverging
lines
of
evolution
at
least
what
is
essential
in
them
but
we
must
take
into
account
retrogressions
arrests
accidents
of
every
kind
and
we
must
remember
above
all
that
each
species
behaves
as
if
the
general
movement
of
life
stopped
at
it
instead
of
passing
through
it
it
thinks
only
of
itself
it
lives
only
for
itself
hence
the
numberless
struggles
that
we
behold
in
nature
hence
a
discord
striking
and
terrible
but
for
which
the
original
principle
of
life
must
not
be
held
responsible
the
part
played
by
contingency
in
evolution
is
therefore
great
contingent
generally
are
the
forms
adopted
or
rather
invented
contingent
relative
to
the
obstacles
encountered
in
a
given
place
and
at
a
given
moment
is
the
dissociation
of
the
primordial
tendency
into
such
and
such
complementary
tendencies
which
create
divergent
lines
of
evolution
contingent
the
arrests
and
contingent
in
large
measure
the
adaptations
two
things
only
are
necessary
a
gradual
accumulation
of
energy
an
elastic
canalization
of
this
energy
in
variable
and
indeterminable
directions
at
the
end
of
which
are
free
acts
this
twofold
result
has
been
obtained
in
a
particular
way
on
our
planet
but
it
might
have
been
obtained
by
entirely
different
means
it
was
not
necessary
that
life
should
fix
its
choice
mainly
upon
the
carbon
of
carbonic
acid
what
was
essential
for
it
was
to
store
solar
energy
but
instead
of
asking
the
sun
to
separate
for
instance
atoms
of
oxygen
and
carbon
it
might
theoretically
at
least
and
apart
from
practical
difficulties
possibly
insurmountable
have
put
forth
other
chemical
elements
which
would
then
have
had
to
be
associated
or
dissociated
by
entirely
different
physical
means
and
if
the
element
characteristic
of
the
substances
that
supply
energy
to
the
organism
had
been
other
than
carbon
the
element
characteristic
of
the
plastic
substances
would
probably
have
been
other
than
nitrogen
and
the
chemistry
of
living
bodies
would
then
have
been
radically
different
from
what
it
is
the
result
would
have
been
living
forms
without
any
analogy
to
those
we
know
whose
anatomy
would
have
been
different
whose
physiology
also
would
have
been
different
alone
the
function
would
have
been
preserved
if
not
in
its
mechanism
at
least
in
its
effects
it
is
therefore
probable
that
life
goes
on
in
other
planets
in
other
solar
systems
also
under
forms
of
which
we
have
no
idea
in
physical
conditions
to
which
it
seems
to
us
from
the
point
of
view
of
our
physiology
to
be
absolutely
opposed
if
its
essential
aim
is
to
catch
up
usable
energy
in
order
to
expend
it
in
explosive
actions
it
probably
chooses
in
each
solar
system
and
on
each
planet
as
it
does
on
the
earth
the
fittest
means
to
get
this
result
in
the
circumstances
with
which
it
is
confronted
that
is
at
least
what
reasoning
by
analogy
leads
to
and
we
use
analogy
the
wrong
way
when
we
declare
life
to
be
impossible
wherever
the
circumstances
with
which
it
is
confronted
are
other
than
those
on
the
earth
the
truth
is
that
life
is
possible
wherever
energy
descends
the
incline
indicated
by
carnot
law
and
where
a
cause
of
inverse
direction
can
retard
the
descent
that
is
to
say
probably
in
all
the
worlds
suspended
from
all
the
stars
we
go
further
it
is
not
even
necessary
that
life
should
be
concentrated
and
determined
in
organisms
properly
so
called
that
is
in
definite
bodies
presenting
to
the
flow
of
energy
though
elastic
canals
it
can
be
conceived
although
it
can
hardly
be
imagined
that
energy
might
be
saved
up
and
then
expended
on
varying
lines
running
across
a
matter
not
yet
solidified
every
essential
of
life
would
still
be
there
since
there
would
still
be
slow
accumulation
of
energy
and
sudden
release
there
would
hardly
be
more
difference
between
this
vitality
vague
and
formless
and
the
definite
vitality
we
know
than
there
is
in
our
psychical
life
between
the
state
of
dream
and
the
state
of
waking
such
may
have
been
the
condition
of
life
in
our
nebula
before
the
condensation
of
matter
was
complete
if
it
be
true
that
life
springs
forward
at
the
very
moment
when
as
the
effect
of
an
inverse
movement
the
nebular
matter
appears
it
is
therefore
conceivable
that
life
might
have
assumed
a
totally
different
outward
appearance
and
designed
forms
very
different
from
those
we
know
with
another
chemical
substratum
in
other
physical
conditions
the
impulsion
would
have
remained
the
same
but
it
would
have
split
up
very
differently
in
course
of
progress
and
the
whole
would
have
traveled
another
road
whether
shorter
or
longer
who
can
tell
in
any
case
in
the
entire
series
of
living
beings
no
term
would
have
been
what
it
now
is
now
was
it
necessary
that
there
should
be
a
series
or
terms
why
should
not
the
unique
impetus
have
been
impressed
on
a
unique
body
which
might
have
gone
on
evolving
this
question
arises
no
doubt
from
the
comparison
of
life
to
an
impetus
and
it
must
be
compared
to
an
impetus
because
no
image
borrowed
from
the
physical
world
can
give
more
nearly
the
idea
of
it
but
it
is
only
an
image
in
reality
life
is
of
the
psychological
order
and
it
is
of
the
essence
of
the
psychical
to
enfold
a
confused
plurality
of
interpenetrating
terms
in
space
and
in
space
only
is
distinct
multiplicity
possible
a
point
is
absolutely
external
to
another
point
but
pure
and
empty
unity
also
is
met
with
only
in
space
it
is
that
of
a
mathematical
point
abstract
unity
and
abstract
multiplicity
are
determinations
of
space
or
categories
of
the
understanding
whichever
we
will
spatiality
and
intellectuality
being
molded
on
each
other
but
what
is
of
psychical
nature
can
not
entirely
correspond
with
space
nor
enter
perfectly
into
the
categories
of
the
understanding
is
my
own
person
at
a
given
moment
one
or
manifold
if
i
declare
it
one
inner
voices
arise
and
protest
those
of
the
sensations
feelings
ideas
among
which
my
individuality
is
distributed
but
if
i
make
it
distinctly
manifold
my
consciousness
rebels
quite
as
strongly
it
affirms
that
my
sensations
my
feelings
my
thoughts
are
abstractions
which
i
effect
on
myself
and
that
each
of
my
states
implies
all
the
others
i
am
then
we
must
adopt
the
language
of
the
understanding
since
only
the
understanding
has
a
language
a
unity
that
is
multiple
and
a
multiplicity
that
is
one
but
unity
and
multiplicity
are
only
views
of
my
personality
taken
by
an
understanding
that
directs
its
categories
at
me
i
enter
neither
into
one
nor
into
the
other
nor
into
both
at
once
although
both
united
may
give
a
fair
imitation
of
the
mutual
interpenetration
and
continuity
that
i
find
at
the
base
of
my
own
self
such
is
my
inner
life
and
such
also
is
life
in
general
while
in
its
contact
with
matter
life
is
comparable
to
an
impulsion
or
an
impetus
regarded
in
itself
it
is
an
immensity
of
potentiality
a
mutual
encroachment
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
tendencies
which
nevertheless
are
thousands
and
thousands
only
when
once
regarded
as
outside
of
each
other
that
is
when
spatialized
contact
with
matter
is
what
determines
this
dissociation
matter
divides
actually
what
was
but
potentially
manifold
and
in
this
sense
individuation
is
in
part
the
work
of
matter
in
part
the
result
of
life
own
inclination
thus
a
poetic
sentiment
which
bursts
into
distinct
verses
lines
and
words
may
be
said
to
have
already
contained
this
multiplicity
of
individuated
elements
and
yet
in
fact
it
is
the
materiality
of
language
that
creates
it
but
through
the
words
lines
and
verses
runs
the
simple
inspiration
which
is
the
whole
poem
so
among
the
dissociated
individuals
one
life
goes
on
moving
everywhere
the
tendency
to
individualize
is
opposed
and
at
the
same
time
completed
by
an
antagonistic
and
complementary
tendency
to
associate
as
if
the
manifold
unity
of
life
drawn
in
the
direction
of
multiplicity
made
so
much
the
more
effort
to
withdraw
itself
on
to
itself
a
part
is
no
sooner
detached
than
it
tends
to
reunite
itself
if
not
to
all
the
rest
at
least
to
what
is
nearest
to
it
hence
throughout
the
whole
realm
of
life
a
balancing
between
individuation
and
association
individuals
join
together
into
a
society
but
the
society
as
soon
as
formed
tends
to
melt
the
associated
individuals
into
a
new
organism
so
as
to
become
itself
an
individual
able
in
its
turn
to
be
part
and
parcel
of
a
new
association
at
the
lowest
degree
of
the
scale
of
organisms
we
already
find
veritable
associations
microbial
colonies
and
in
these
associations
according
to
a
recent
work
a
tendency
to
individuate
by
the
constitution
of
a
nucleus
the
same
tendency
is
met
with
again
at
a
higher
stage
in
the
protophytes
which
once
having
quitted
the
parent
cell
by
way
of
division
remain
united
to
each
other
by
the
gelatinous
substance
that
surrounds
them
also
in
those
protozoa
which
begin
by
mingling
their
pseudopodia
and
end
by
welding
themselves
together
the
colonial
theory
of
the
genesis
of
higher
organisms
is
well
known
the
protozoa
consisting
of
one
single
cell
are
supposed
to
have
formed
by
assemblage
aggregates
which
relating
themselves
together
in
their
turn
have
given
rise
to
aggregates
of
aggregates
so
organisms
more
and
more
complicated
and
also
more
and
more
differentiated
are
born
of
the
association
of
organisms
barely
differentiated
and
elementary
in
this
extreme
form
the
theory
is
open
to
grave
objections
more
and
more
the
idea
seems
to
be
gaining
ground
that
polyzoism
is
an
exceptional
and
abnormal
fact
but
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
things
happen
every
higher
organism
was
born
of
an
association
of
cells
that
have
subdivided
the
work
between
them
very
probably
it
is
not
the
cells
that
have
made
the
individual
by
means
of
association
it
is
rather
the
individual
that
has
made
the
cells
by
means
of
dissociation
but
this
itself
reveals
to
us
in
the
genesis
of
the
individual
a
haunting
of
the
social
form
as
if
the
individual
could
develop
only
on
the
condition
that
its
substance
should
be
split
up
into
elements
having
themselves
an
appearance
of
individuality
and
united
among
themselves
by
an
appearance
of
sociality
there
are
numerous
cases
in
which
nature
seems
to
hesitate
between
the
two
forms
and
to
ask
herself
if
she
shall
make
a
society
or
an
individual
the
slightest
push
is
enough
then
to
make
the
balance
weigh
on
one
side
or
the
other
if
we
take
an
infusorian
sufficiently
large
such
as
the
stentor
and
cut
it
into
two
halves
each
containing
a
part
of
the
nucleus
each
of
the
two
halves
will
generate
an
independent
stentor
but
if
we
divide
it
incompletely
so
that
a
protoplasmic
communication
is
left
between
the
two
halves
we
shall
see
them
execute
each
from
its
side
corresponding
movements
so
that
in
this
case
it
is
enough
that
a
thread
should
be
maintained
or
cut
in
order
that
life
should
affect
the
social
or
the
individual
form
thus
in
rudimentary
organisms
consisting
of
a
single
cell
we
already
find
that
the
apparent
individuality
of
the
whole
is
the
composition
of
an
number
of
potential
individualities
potentially
associated
but
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
series
of
living
beings
the
same
law
is
manifested
and
it
is
this
that
we
express
when
we
say
that
unity
and
multiplicity
are
categories
of
inert
matter
that
the
vital
impetus
is
neither
pure
unity
nor
pure
multiplicity
and
that
if
the
matter
to
which
it
communicates
itself
compels
it
to
choose
one
of
the
two
its
choice
will
never
be
definitive
it
will
leap
from
one
to
the
other
indefinitely
the
evolution
of
life
in
the
double
direction
of
individuality
and
association
has
therefore
nothing
accidental
about
it
it
is
due
to
the
very
nature
of
life
essential
also
is
the
progress
to
reflexion
if
our
analysis
is
correct
it
is
consciousness
or
rather
that
is
at
the
origin
of
life
consciousness
or
is
the
name
for
the
rocket
whose
extinguished
fragments
fall
back
as
matter
consciousness
again
is
the
name
for
that
which
subsists
of
the
rocket
itself
passing
through
the
fragments
and
lighting
them
up
into
organisms
but
this
consciousness
which
is
a
of
is
made
manifest
to
itself
only
where
creation
is
possible
it
lies
dormant
when
life
is
condemned
to
automatism
it
wakens
as
soon
as
the
possibility
of
a
choice
is
restored
that
is
why
in
organisms
unprovided
with
a
nervous
system
it
varies
according
to
the
power
of
locomotion
and
of
deformation
of
which
the
organism
disposes
and
in
animals
with
a
nervous
system
it
is
proportional
to
the
complexity
of
the
switchboard
on
which
the
paths
called
sensory
and
the
paths
called
motor
intersect
that
is
of
the
brain
how
must
this
solidarity
between
the
organism
and
consciousness
be
understood
we
will
not
dwell
here
on
a
point
that
we
have
dealt
with
in
former
works
let
us
merely
recall
that
a
theory
such
as
that
according
to
which
consciousness
is
attached
to
certain
neurons
and
is
thrown
off
from
their
work
like
a
phosphorescence
may
be
accepted
by
the
scientist
for
the
detail
of
analysis
it
is
a
convenient
mode
of
expression
but
it
is
nothing
else
in
reality
a
living
being
is
a
centre
of
action
it
represents
a
certain
sum
of
contingency
entering
into
the
world
that
is
to
say
a
certain
quantity
of
possible
action
a
quantity
variable
with
individuals
and
especially
with
species
the
nervous
system
of
an
animal
marks
out
the
flexible
lines
on
which
its
action
will
run
although
the
potential
energy
is
accumulated
in
the
muscles
rather
than
in
the
nervous
system
itself
its
nervous
centres
indicate
by
their
development
and
their
configuration
the
more
or
less
extended
choice
it
will
have
among
more
or
less
numerous
and
complicated
actions
now
since
the
awakening
of
consciousness
in
a
living
creature
is
the
more
complete
the
greater
the
latitude
of
choice
allowed
to
it
and
the
larger
the
amount
of
action
bestowed
upon
it
it
is
clear
that
the
development
of
consciousness
will
appear
to
be
dependent
on
that
of
the
nervous
centres
on
the
other
hand
every
state
of
consciousness
being
in
one
aspect
of
it
a
question
put
to
the
motor
activity
and
even
the
beginning
of
a
reply
there
is
no
psychical
event
that
does
not
imply
the
entry
into
play
of
the
cortical
mechanisms
everything
seems
therefore
to
happen
consciousness
sprang
from
the
brain
and
the
detail
of
conscious
activity
were
modeled
on
that
of
the
cerebral
activity
in
reality
consciousness
does
not
spring
from
the
brain
but
brain
and
consciousness
correspond
because
equally
they
measure
the
one
by
the
complexity
of
its
structure
and
the
other
by
the
intensity
of
its
awareness
the
quantity
of
that
the
living
being
has
at
its
disposal
it
is
precisely
because
a
cerebral
state
expresses
simply
what
there
is
of
nascent
action
in
the
corresponding
psychical
state
that
the
psychical
state
tells
us
more
than
the
cerebral
state
the
consciousness
of
a
living
being
as
we
have
tried
to
prove
elsewhere
is
inseparable
from
its
brain
in
the
sense
in
which
a
sharp
knife
is
inseparable
from
its
edge
the
brain
is
the
sharp
edge
by
which
consciousness
cuts
into
the
compact
tissue
of
events
but
the
brain
is
no
more
coextensive
with
consciousness
than
the
edge
is
with
the
knife
thus
from
the
fact
that
two
brains
like
that
of
the
ape
and
that
of
the
man
are
very
much
alike
we
can
not
conclude
that
the
corresponding
consciousnesses
are
comparable
or
commensurable
but
the
two
brains
may
perhaps
be
less
alike
than
we
suppose
how
can
we
help
being
struck
by
the
fact
that
while
man
is
capable
of
learning
any
sort
of
exercise
of
constructing
any
sort
of
object
in
short
of
acquiring
any
kind
of
motor
habit
whatsoever
the
faculty
of
combining
new
movements
is
strictly
limited
in
the
animal
even
in
the
ape
the
cerebral
characteristic
of
man
is
there
the
human
brain
is
made
like
every
brain
to
set
up
motor
mechanisms
and
to
enable
us
to
choose
among
them
at
any
instant
the
one
we
shall
put
in
motion
by
the
pull
of
a
trigger
but
it
differs
from
other
brains
in
this
that
the
number
of
mechanisms
it
can
set
up
and
consequently
the
choice
that
it
gives
as
to
which
among
them
shall
be
released
is
unlimited
now
from
the
limited
to
the
unlimited
there
is
all
the
distance
between
the
closed
and
the
open
it
is
not
a
difference
of
degree
but
of
kind
radical
therefore
also
is
the
difference
between
animal
consciousness
even
the
most
intelligent
and
human
consciousness
for
consciousness
corresponds
exactly
to
the
living
being
power
of
choice
it
is
coextensive
with
the
fringe
of
possible
action
that
surrounds
the
real
action
consciousness
is
synonymous
with
invention
and
with
freedom
now
in
the
animal
invention
is
never
anything
but
a
variation
on
the
theme
of
routine
shut
up
in
the
habits
of
the
species
it
succeeds
no
doubt
in
enlarging
them
by
its
individual
initiative
but
it
escapes
automatism
only
for
an
instant
for
just
the
time
to
create
a
new
automatism
the
gates
of
its
prison
close
as
soon
as
they
are
opened
by
pulling
at
its
chain
it
succeeds
only
in
stretching
it
with
man
consciousness
breaks
the
chain
in
man
and
in
man
alone
it
sets
itself
free
the
whole
history
of
life
until
man
has
been
that
of
the
effort
of
consciousness
to
raise
matter
and
of
the
more
or
less
complete
overwhelming
of
consciousness
by
the
matter
which
has
fallen
back
on
it
the
enterprise
was
paradoxical
if
indeed
we
may
speak
here
otherwise
than
by
metaphor
of
enterprise
and
of
effort
it
was
to
create
with
matter
which
is
necessity
itself
an
instrument
of
freedom
to
make
a
machine
which
should
triumph
over
mechanism
and
to
use
the
determinism
of
nature
to
pass
through
the
meshes
of
the
net
which
this
very
determinism
had
spread
but
everywhere
except
in
man
consciousness
has
let
itself
be
caught
in
the
net
whose
meshes
it
tried
to
pass
through
it
has
remained
the
captive
of
the
mechanisms
it
has
set
up
automatism
which
it
tries
to
draw
in
the
direction
of
freedom
winds
about
it
and
drags
it
down
it
has
not
the
power
to
escape
because
the
energy
it
has
provided
for
acts
is
almost
all
employed
in
maintaining
the
infinitely
subtle
and
essentially
unstable
equilibrium
into
which
it
has
brought
matter
but
man
not
only
maintains
his
machine
he
succeeds
in
using
it
as
he
pleases
doubtless
he
owes
this
to
the
superiority
of
his
brain
which
enables
him
to
build
an
unlimited
number
of
motor
mechanisms
to
oppose
new
habits
to
the
old
ones
unceasingly
and
by
dividing
automatism
against
itself
to
rule
it
he
owes
it
to
his
language
which
furnishes
consciousness
with
an
immaterial
body
in
which
to
incarnate
itself
and
thus
exempts
it
from
dwelling
exclusively
on
material
bodies
whose
flux
would
soon
drag
it
along
and
finally
swallow
it
up
he
owes
it
to
social
life
which
stores
and
preserves
efforts
as
language
stores
thought
fixes
thereby
a
mean
level
to
which
individuals
must
raise
themselves
at
the
outset
and
by
this
initial
stimulation
prevents
the
average
man
from
slumbering
and
drives
the
superior
man
to
mount
still
higher
but
our
brain
our
society
and
our
language
are
only
the
external
and
various
signs
of
one
and
the
same
internal
superiority
they
tell
each
after
its
manner
the
unique
exceptional
success
which
life
has
won
at
a
given
moment
of
its
evolution
they
express
the
difference
of
kind
and
not
only
of
degree
which
separates
man
from
the
rest
of
the
animal
world
they
let
us
guess
that
while
at
the
end
of
the
vast
from
which
life
has
taken
its
leap
all
the
others
have
stepped
down
finding
the
cord
stretched
too
high
man
alone
has
cleared
the
obstacle
it
is
in
this
quite
special
sense
that
man
is
the
term
and
the
end
of
evolution
life
we
have
said
transcends
finality
as
it
transcends
the
other
categories
it
is
essentially
a
current
sent
through
matter
drawing
from
it
what
it
can
there
has
not
therefore
properly
speaking
been
any
project
or
plan
on
the
other
hand
it
is
abundantly
evident
that
the
rest
of
nature
is
not
for
the
sake
of
man
we
struggle
like
the
other
species
we
have
struggled
against
other
species
moreover
if
the
evolution
of
life
had
encountered
other
accidents
in
its
course
if
thereby
the
current
of
life
had
been
otherwise
divided
we
should
have
been
physically
and
morally
far
different
from
what
we
are
for
these
various
reasons
it
would
be
wrong
to
regard
humanity
such
as
we
have
it
before
our
eyes
as
in
the
evolutionary
movement
it
can
not
even
be
said
to
be
the
outcome
of
the
whole
of
evolution
for
evolution
has
been
accomplished
on
several
divergent
lines
and
while
the
human
species
is
at
the
end
of
one
of
them
other
lines
have
been
followed
with
other
species
at
their
end
it
is
in
a
quite
different
sense
that
we
hold
humanity
to
be
the
ground
of
evolution
from
our
point
of
view
life
appears
in
its
entirety
as
an
immense
wave
which
starting
from
a
centre
spreads
outwards
and
which
on
almost
the
whole
of
its
circumference
is
stopped
and
converted
into
oscillation
at
one
single
point
the
obstacle
has
been
forced
the
impulsion
has
passed
freely
it
is
this
freedom
that
the
human
form
registers
everywhere
but
in
man
consciousness
has
had
to
come
to
a
stand
in
man
alone
it
has
kept
on
its
way
man
then
continues
the
vital
movement
indefinitely
although
he
does
not
draw
along
with
him
all
that
life
carries
in
itself
on
other
lines
of
evolution
there
have
traveled
other
tendencies
which
life
implied
and
of
which
since
everything
interpenetrates
man
has
doubtless
kept
something
but
of
which
he
has
kept
only
very
little
is
as
if
a
vague
and
formless
being
whom
we
may
call
as
we
man
superman
sought
to
realize
himself
and
had
succeeded
only
by
abandoning
a
part
of
himself
on
the
the
losses
are
represented
by
the
rest
of
the
animal
world
and
even
by
the
vegetable
world
at
least
in
what
these
have
that
is
positive
and
above
the
accidents
of
evolution
from
this
point
of
view
the
discordances
of
which
nature
offers
us
the
spectacle
are
singularly
weakened
the
organized
world
as
a
whole
becomes
as
the
soil
on
which
was
to
grow
either
man
himself
or
a
being
who
morally
must
resemble
him
the
animals
however
distant
they
may
be
from
our
species
however
hostile
to
it
have
none
the
less
been
useful
traveling
companions
on
whom
consciousness
has
unloaded
whatever
encumbrances
it
was
dragging
along
and
who
have
enabled
it
to
rise
in
man
to
heights
from
which
it
sees
an
unlimited
horizon
open
again
before
it
it
is
true
that
it
has
not
only
abandoned
cumbersome
baggage
on
the
way
it
has
also
had
to
give
up
valuable
goods
consciousness
in
man
is
intellect
it
might
have
been
it
ought
so
it
seems
to
have
been
also
intuition
intuition
and
intellect
represent
two
opposite
directions
of
the
work
of
consciousness
intuition
goes
in
the
very
direction
of
life
intellect
goes
in
the
inverse
direction
and
thus
finds
itself
naturally
in
accordance
with
the
movement
of
matter
a
complete
and
perfect
humanity
would
be
that
in
which
these
two
forms
of
conscious
activity
should
attain
their
full
development
and
between
this
humanity
and
ours
we
may
conceive
any
number
of
possible
stages
corresponding
to
all
the
degrees
imaginable
of
intelligence
and
of
intuition
in
this
lies
the
part
of
contingency
in
the
mental
structure
of
our
species
a
different
evolution
might
have
led
to
a
humanity
either
more
intellectual
still
or
more
intuitive
in
the
humanity
of
which
we
are
a
part
intuition
is
in
fact
almost
completely
sacrificed
to
intellect
it
seems
that
to
conquer
matter
and
to
reconquer
its
own
self
consciousness
has
had
to
exhaust
the
best
part
of
its
power
this
conquest
in
the
particular
conditions
in
which
it
has
been
accomplished
has
required
that
consciousness
should
adapt
itself
to
the
habits
of
matter
and
concentrate
all
its
attention
on
them
in
fact
determine
itself
more
especially
as
intellect
intuition
is
there
however
but
vague
and
above
all
discontinuous
it
is
a
lamp
almost
extinguished
which
only
glimmers
now
and
then
for
a
few
moments
at
most
but
it
glimmers
wherever
a
vital
interest
is
at
stake
on
our
personality
on
our
liberty
on
the
place
we
occupy
in
the
whole
of
nature
on
our
origin
and
perhaps
also
on
our
destiny
it
throws
a
light
feeble
and
vacillating
but
which
none
the
less
pierces
the
darkness
of
the
night
in
which
the
intellect
leaves
us
these
fleeting
intuitions
which
light
up
their
object
only
at
distant
intervals
philosophy
ought
to
seize
first
to
sustain
them
then
to
expand
them
and
so
unite
them
together
the
more
it
advances
in
this
work
the
more
will
it
perceive
that
intuition
is
mind
itself
and
in
a
certain
sense
life
itself
the
intellect
has
been
cut
out
of
it
by
a
process
resembling
that
which
has
generated
matter
thus
is
revealed
the
unity
of
the
spiritual
life
we
recognize
it
only
when
we
place
ourselves
in
intuition
in
order
to
go
from
intuition
to
the
intellect
for
from
the
intellect
we
shall
never
pass
to
intuition
philosophy
introduces
us
thus
into
the
spiritual
life
and
it
shows
us
at
the
same
time
the
relation
of
the
life
of
the
spirit
to
that
of
the
body
the
great
error
of
the
doctrines
on
the
spirit
has
been
the
idea
that
by
isolating
the
spiritual
life
from
all
the
rest
by
suspending
it
in
space
as
high
as
possible
above
the
earth
they
were
placing
it
beyond
attack
as
if
they
were
not
thereby
simply
exposing
it
to
be
taken
as
an
effect
of
mirage
certainly
they
are
right
to
listen
to
conscience
when
conscience
affirms
human
freedom
but
the
intellect
is
there
which
says
that
the
cause
determines
its
effect
that
like
conditions
like
that
all
is
repeated
and
that
all
is
given
they
are
right
to
believe
in
the
absolute
reality
of
the
person
and
in
his
independence
toward
matter
but
science
is
there
which
shows
the
interdependence
of
conscious
life
and
cerebral
activity
they
are
right
to
attribute
to
man
a
privileged
place
in
nature
to
hold
that
the
distance
is
infinite
between
the
animal
and
man
but
the
history
of
life
is
there
which
makes
us
witness
the
genesis
of
species
by
gradual
transformation
and
seems
thus
to
reintegrate
man
in
animality
when
a
strong
instinct
assures
the
probability
of
personal
survival
they
are
right
not
to
close
their
ears
to
its
voice
but
if
there
exist
souls
capable
of
an
independent
life
whence
do
they
come
when
how
and
why
do
they
enter
into
this
body
which
we
see
arise
quite
naturally
from
a
mixed
cell
derived
from
the
bodies
of
its
two
parents
all
these
questions
will
remain
unanswered
a
philosophy
of
intuition
will
be
a
negation
of
science
will
be
sooner
or
later
swept
away
by
science
if
it
does
not
resolve
to
see
the
life
of
the
body
just
where
it
really
is
on
the
road
that
leads
to
the
life
of
the
spirit
but
it
will
then
no
longer
have
to
do
with
definite
living
beings
life
as
a
whole
from
the
initial
impulsion
that
thrust
it
into
the
world
will
appear
as
a
wave
which
rises
and
which
is
opposed
by
the
descending
movement
of
matter
on
the
greater
part
of
its
surface
at
different
heights
the
current
is
converted
by
matter
into
a
vortex
at
one
point
alone
it
passes
freely
dragging
with
it
the
obstacle
which
will
weigh
on
its
progress
but
will
not
stop
it
at
this
point
is
humanity
it
is
our
privileged
situation
on
the
other
hand
this
rising
wave
is
consciousness
and
like
all
consciousness
it
includes
potentialities
without
number
which
interpenetrate
and
to
which
consequently
neither
the
category
of
unity
nor
that
of
multiplicity
is
appropriate
made
as
they
both
are
for
inert
matter
the
matter
that
it
bears
along
with
it
and
in
the
interstices
of
which
it
inserts
itself
alone
can
divide
it
into
distinct
individualities
on
flows
the
current
running
through
human
generations
subdividing
itself
into
individuals
this
subdivision
was
vaguely
indicated
in
it
but
could
not
have
been
made
clear
without
matter
thus
souls
are
continually
being
created
which
nevertheless
in
a
certain
sense
they
are
nothing
else
than
the
little
rills
into
which
the
great
river
of
life
divides
itself
flowing
through
the
body
of
humanity
the
movement
of
the
stream
is
distinct
from
the
river
bed
although
it
must
adopt
its
winding
course
consciousness
is
distinct
from
the
organism
it
animates
although
it
must
undergo
its
vicissitudes
as
the
possible
actions
which
a
state
of
consciousness
indicates
are
at
every
instant
beginning
to
be
carried
out
in
the
nervous
centres
the
brain
underlines
at
every
instant
the
motor
indications
of
the
state
of
consciousness
but
the
interdependency
of
consciousness
and
brain
is
limited
to
this
the
destiny
of
consciousness
is
not
bound
up
on
that
account
with
the
destiny
of
cerebral
matter
finally
consciousness
is
essentially
free
it
is
freedom
itself
but
it
can
not
pass
through
matter
without
settling
on
it
without
adapting
itself
to
it
this
adaptation
is
what
we
call
intellectuality
and
the
intellect
turning
itself
back
toward
active
that
is
to
say
free
consciousness
naturally
makes
it
enter
into
the
conceptual
forms
into
which
it
is
accustomed
to
see
matter
fit
it
will
therefore
always
perceive
freedom
in
the
form
of
necessity
it
will
always
neglect
the
part
of
novelty
or
of
creation
inherent
in
the
free
act
it
will
always
substitute
for
action
itself
an
imitation
artificial
approximative
obtained
by
compounding
the
old
with
the
old
and
the
same
with
the
same
thus
to
the
eyes
of
a
philosophy
that
attempts
to
reabsorb
intellect
in
intuition
many
difficulties
vanish
or
become
light
but
such
a
doctrine
does
not
only
facilitate
speculation
it
gives
us
also
more
power
to
act
and
to
live
for
with
it
we
feel
ourselves
no
longer
isolated
in
humanity
humanity
no
longer
seems
isolated
in
the
nature
that
it
dominates
as
the

inverse

together
and
all
yield
to

tremendous
push

its
stand
on
the

man
bestrides
animality
and
the
whole
of
humanity
in

in

one
immense
army
galloping
beside

each
of

overwhelming
charge

the
cinematographical
mechanism
of
thought
and
the
mechanistic
illusion
a
glance
at
the
history
of
systems
real
becoming
and
false
evolutionism
it
remains
for
us
to
examine
in
themselves
two
theoretical
illusions
which
we
have
frequently
met
with
before
but
whose
consequences
rather
than
principle
have
hitherto
concerned
us
such
is
the
object
of
the
present
chapter
it
will
afford
us
the
opportunity
of
removing
certain
objections
of
clearing
up
certain
misunderstandings
and
above
all
of
defining
more
precisely
by
contrasting
it
with
others
a
philosophy
which
sees
in
duration
the
very
stuff
of
reality
matter
or
mind
reality
has
appeared
to
us
as
a
perpetual
becoming
it
makes
itself
or
it
unmakes
itself
but
it
is
never
something
made
such
is
the
intuition
that
we
have
of
mind
when
we
draw
aside
the
veil
which
is
interposed
between
our
consciousness
and
ourselves
this
also
is
what
our
intellect
and
senses
themselves
would
show
us
of
matter
if
they
could
obtain
a
direct
and
disinterested
idea
of
it
but
preoccupied
before
everything
with
the
necessities
of
action
the
intellect
like
the
senses
is
limited
to
taking
at
intervals
views
that
are
instantaneous
and
by
that
very
fact
immobile
of
the
becoming
of
matter
consciousness
being
in
its
turn
formed
on
the
intellect
sees
clearly
of
the
inner
life
what
is
already
made
and
only
feels
confusedly
the
making
thus
we
pluck
out
of
duration
those
moments
that
interest
us
and
that
we
have
gathered
along
its
course
these
alone
we
retain
and
we
are
right
in
so
doing
while
action
only
is
in
question
but
when
in
on
the
of
the
real
we
go
on
regarding
it
as
our
practical
interest
requires
us
to
regard
it
we
become
unable
to
perceive
the
true
evolution
the
radical
becoming
of
becoming
we
perceive
only
states
of
duration
only
instants
and
even
when
we
speak
of
duration
and
of
becoming
it
is
of
another
thing
that
we
are
thinking
such
is
the
most
striking
of
the
two
illusions
we
wish
to
examine
it
consists
in
supposing
that
we
can
think
the
unstable
by
means
of
the
stable
the
moving
by
means
of
the
immobile
the
other
illusion
is
near
akin
to
the
first
it
has
the
same
origin
being
also
due
to
the
fact
that
we
import
into
speculation
a
procedure
made
for
practice
all
action
aims
at
getting
something
that
we
feel
the
want
of
or
at
creating
something
that
does
not
yet
exist
in
this
very
special
sense
it
fills
a
void
and
goes
from
the
empty
to
the
full
from
an
absence
to
a
presence
from
the
unreal
to
the
real
now
the
unreality
which
is
here
in
question
is
purely
relative
to
the
direction
in
which
our
attention
is
engaged
for
we
are
immersed
in
realities
and
can
not
pass
out
of
them
only
if
the
present
reality
is
not
the
one
we
are
seeking
we
speak
of
the
of
this
reality
wherever
we
find
the
of
another
we
thus
express
what
we
have
as
a
function
of
what
we
want
this
is
quite
legitimate
in
the
sphere
of
action
but
whether
we
will
or
no
we
keep
to
this
way
of
speaking
and
also
of
thinking
when
we
speculate
on
the
nature
of
things
independently
of
the
interest
they
have
for
us
thus
arises
the
second
of
the
two
illusions
we
propose
to
examine
this
first
it
is
due
like
the
other
to
the
static
habits
that
our
intellect
contracts
when
it
prepares
our
action
on
things
just
as
we
pass
through
the
immobile
to
go
to
the
moving
so
we
make
use
of
the
void
in
order
to
think
the
full
we
have
met
with
this
illusion
already
in
dealing
with
the
fundamental
problem
of
knowledge
the
question
we
then
said
is
to
know
why
there
is
order
and
not
disorder
in
things
but
the
question
has
meaning
only
if
we
suppose
that
disorder
understood
as
an
absence
of
order
is
possible
or
imaginable
or
conceivable
now
it
is
only
order
that
is
real
but
as
order
can
take
two
forms
and
as
the
presence
of
the
one
may
be
said
to
consist
in
the
absence
of
the
other
we
speak
of
disorder
whenever
we
have
before
us
that
one
of
the
two
orders
for
which
we
are
not
looking
the
idea
of
disorder
is
then
entirely
practical
it
corresponds
to
the
disappointment
of
a
certain
expectation
and
it
does
not
denote
the
absence
of
all
order
but
only
the
presence
of
that
order
which
does
not
offer
us
actual
interest
so
that
whenever
we
try
to
deny
order
completely
absolutely
we
find
that
we
are
leaping
from
one
kind
of
order
to
the
other
indefinitely
and
that
the
supposed
suppression
of
the
one
and
the
other
implies
the
presence
of
the
two
indeed
if
we
go
on
and
persist
in
shutting
our
eyes
to
this
movement
of
the
mind
and
all
it
involves
we
are
no
longer
dealing
with
an
idea
all
that
is
left
of
disorder
is
a
word
thus
the
problem
of
knowledge
is
complicated
and
possibly
made
insoluble
by
the
idea
that
order
fills
a
void
and
that
its
actual
presence
is
superposed
on
its
virtual
absence
we
go
from
absence
to
presence
from
the
void
to
the
full
in
virtue
of
the
fundamental
illusion
of
our
understanding
that
is
the
error
of
which
we
noticed
one
consequence
in
our
last
chapter
as
we
then
anticipated
we
must
come
to
close
quarters
with
this
error
and
finally
grapple
with
it
we
must
face
it
in
itself
in
the
radically
false
conception
which
it
implies
of
negation
of
the
void
and
of
the
nought
philosophers
have
paid
little
attention
to
the
idea
of
the
nought
and
yet
it
is
often
the
hidden
spring
the
invisible
mover
of
philosophical
thinking
from
the
first
awakening
of
reflection
it
is
this
that
pushes
to
the
fore
right
under
the
eyes
of
consciousness
the
torturing
problems
the
questions
that
we
can
not
gaze
at
without
feeling
giddy
and
bewildered
i
have
no
sooner
commenced
to
philosophize
than
i
ask
myself
why
i
exist
and
when
i
take
account
of
the
intimate
connection
in
which
i
stand
to
the
rest
of
the
universe
the
difficulty
is
only
pushed
back
for
i
want
to
know
why
the
universe
exists
and
if
i
refer
the
universe
to
a
principle
immanent
or
transcendent
that
supports
it
or
creates
it
my
thought
rests
on
this
principle
only
a
few
moments
for
the
same
problem
recurs
this
time
in
its
full
breadth
and
generality
whence
comes
it
and
how
can
it
be
understood
that
anything
exists
even
here
in
the
present
work
when
matter
has
been
defined
as
a
kind
of
descent
this
descent
as
the
interruption
of
a
rise
this
rise
itself
as
a
growth
when
finally
a
principle
of
creation
has
been
put
at
the
base
of
things
the
same
question
springs
up
how
why
does
this
principle
exist
rather
than
nothing
now
if
i
push
these
questions
aside
and
go
straight
to
what
hides
behind
them
this
is
what
i
find
existence
appears
to
me
like
a
conquest
over
nought
i
say
to
myself
that
there
might
be
that
indeed
there
ought
to
be
nothing
and
i
then
wonder
that
there
is
something
or
i
represent
all
reality
extended
on
nothing
as
on
a
carpet
at
first
was
nothing
and
being
has
come
by
superaddition
to
it
or
yet
again
if
something
has
always
existed
nothing
must
always
have
served
as
its
substratum
or
receptacle
and
is
therefore
eternally
prior
a
glass
may
have
always
been
full
but
the
liquid
it
contains
nevertheless
fills
a
void
in
the
same
way
being
may
have
always
been
there
but
the
nought
which
is
filled
and
as
it
were
stopped
up
by
it
for
it
none
the
less
if
not
in
fact
at
least
in
right
in
short
i
can
not
get
rid
of
the
idea
that
the
full
is
an
embroidery
on
the
canvas
of
the
void
that
being
is
superimposed
on
nothing
and
that
in
the
idea
of
nothing
there
is
than
in
that
of
something
hence
all
the
mystery
it
is
necessary
that
this
mystery
should
be
cleared
up
it
is
more
especially
necessary
if
we
put
duration
and
free
choice
at
the
base
of
things
for
the
disdain
of
metaphysics
for
all
reality
that
endures
comes
precisely
from
this
that
it
reaches
being
only
by
passing
through
and
that
an
existence
which
endures
seems
to
it
not
strong
enough
to
conquer
and
itself
posit
itself
it
is
for
this
reason
especially
that
it
is
inclined
to
endow
true
being
with
a
and
not
a
psychological
nor
a
physical
existence
for
the
nature
of
a
purely
logical
existence
is
such
that
it
seems
to
be
and
to
posit
itself
by
the
effect
alone
of
the
force
immanent
in
truth
if
i
ask
myself
why
bodies
or
minds
exist
rather
than
nothing
i
find
no
answer
but
that
a
logical
principle
such
as
should
have
the
power
of
creating
itself
triumphing
over
the
nought
throughout
eternity
seems
to
me
natural
a
circle
drawn
with
chalk
on
a
blackboard
is
a
thing
which
needs
explanation
this
entirely
physical
existence
has
not
by
itself
wherewith
to
vanquish
but
the
logical
essence
of
the
circle
that
is
to
say
the
possibility
of
drawing
it
according
to
a
certain
law
in
short
its
definition
is
a
thing
which
appears
to
me
eternal
it
has
neither
place
nor
date
for
nowhere
at
no
moment
has
the
drawing
of
a
circle
begun
to
be
possible
suppose
then
that
the
principle
on
which
all
things
rest
and
which
all
things
manifest
possesses
an
existence
of
the
same
nature
as
that
of
the
definition
of
the
circle
or
as
that
of
the
axiom
the
mystery
of
existence
vanishes
for
the
being
that
is
at
the
base
of
everything
posits
itself
then
in
eternity
as
logic
itself
does
true
it
will
cost
us
rather
a
heavy
sacrifice
if
the
principle
of
all
things
exists
after
the
manner
of
a
logical
axiom
or
of
a
mathematical
definition
the
things
themselves
must
go
forth
from
this
principle
like
the
applications
of
an
axiom
or
the
consequences
of
a
definition
and
there
will
no
longer
be
place
either
in
the
things
nor
in
their
principle
for
efficient
causality
understood
in
the
sense
of
a
free
choice
such
are
precisely
the
conclusions
of
a
doctrine
like
that
of
spinoza
or
even
that
of
leibniz
and
such
indeed
has
been
their
genesis
now
if
we
could
prove
that
the
idea
of
the
nought
in
the
sense
in
which
we
take
it
when
we
oppose
it
to
that
of
existence
is
a
the
problems
that
are
raised
around
it
would
become
the
hypothesis
of
an
absolute
that
acts
freely
that
in
an
eminent
sense
endures
would
no
longer
raise
up
intellectual
prejudices
the
road
would
be
cleared
for
a
philosophy
more
nearly
approaching
intuition
and
which
would
no
longer
ask
the
same
sacrifices
of
common
sense
let
us
then
see
what
we
are
thinking
about
when
we
speak
of
nothing
to
represent
nothing
we
must
either
imagine
it
or
conceive
it
let
us
examine
what
this
image
or
this
idea
may
be
first
the
image
i
am
going
to
close
my
eyes
stop
my
ears
extinguish
one
by
one
the
sensations
that
come
to
me
from
the
outer
world
now
it
is
done
all
my
perceptions
vanish
the
material
universe
sinks
into
silence
and
the
i
subsist
however
and
can
not
help
myself
subsisting
i
am
still
there
with
the
organic
sensations
which
come
to
me
from
the
surface
and
from
the
interior
of
my
body
with
the
recollections
which
my
past
perceptions
have
left
behind
them
nay
with
the
impression
most
positive
and
full
of
the
void
i
have
just
made
about
me
how
can
i
suppress
all
this
how
eliminate
myself
i
can
even
it
may
be
blot
out
and
forget
my
recollections
up
to
my
immediate
past
but
at
least
i
keep
the
consciousness
of
my
present
reduced
to
its
extremest
poverty
that
is
to
say
of
the
actual
state
of
my
body
i
will
try
however
to
do
away
even
with
this
consciousness
itself
i
will
reduce
more
and
more
the
sensations
my
body
sends
in
to
me
now
they
are
almost
gone
now
they
are
gone
they
have
disappeared
in
the
night
where
all
things
else
have
already
died
away
but
no
at
the
very
instant
that
my
consciousness
is
extinguished
another
consciousness
lights
up
or
rather
it
was
already
alight
it
had
arisen
the
instant
before
in
order
to
witness
the
extinction
of
the
first
for
the
first
could
disappear
only
for
another
and
in
the
presence
of
another
i
see
myself
annihilated
only
if
i
have
already
resuscitated
myself
by
an
act
which
is
positive
however
involuntary
and
unconscious
so
do
what
i
will
i
am
always
perceiving
something
either
from
without
or
from
within
when
i
no
longer
know
anything
of
external
objects
it
is
because
i
have
taken
refuge
in
the
consciousness
that
i
have
of
myself
if
i
abolish
this
inner
self
its
very
abolition
becomes
an
object
for
an
imaginary
self
which
now
perceives
as
an
external
object
the
self
that
is
dying
away
be
it
external
or
internal
some
object
there
always
is
that
my
imagination
is
representing
my
imagination
it
is
true
can
go
from
one
to
the
other
i
can
by
turns
imagine
a
nought
of
external
perception
or
a
nought
of
internal
perception
but
not
both
at
once
for
the
absence
of
one
consists
at
bottom
in
the
exclusive
presence
of
the
other
but
from
the
fact
that
two
relative
noughts
are
imaginable
in
turn
we
wrongly
conclude
that
they
are
imaginable
together
a
conclusion
the
absurdity
of
which
must
be
obvious
for
we
can
not
imagine
a
nought
without
perceiving
at
least
confusedly
that
we
are
imagining
it
consequently
that
we
are
acting
that
we
are
thinking
and
therefore
that
something
still
subsists
the
image
then
properly
so
called
of
a
suppression
of
everything
is
never
formed
by
thought
the
effort
by
which
we
strive
to
create
this
image
simply
ends
in
making
us
swing
to
and
fro
between
the
vision
of
an
outer
and
that
of
an
inner
reality
in
this
coming
and
going
of
our
mind
between
the
without
and
the
within
there
is
a
point
at
equal
distance
from
both
in
which
it
seems
to
us
that
we
no
longer
perceive
the
one
and
that
we
do
not
yet
perceive
the
other
it
is
there
that
the
image
of
nothing
is
formed
in
reality
we
then
perceive
both
having
reached
the
point
where
the
two
terms
come
together
and
the
image
of
nothing
so
defined
is
an
image
full
of
things
an
image
that
includes
at
once
that
of
the
subject
and
that
of
the
object
and
besides
a
perpetual
leaping
from
one
to
the
other
and
the
refusal
ever
to
come
to
rest
finally
on
either
evidently
this
is
not
the
nothing
that
we
can
oppose
to
being
and
put
before
or
beneath
being
for
it
already
includes
existence
in
general
but
we
shall
be
told
that
if
the
representation
of
nothing
visible
or
latent
enters
into
the
reasonings
of
philosophers
it
is
not
as
an
image
but
as
an
idea
it
may
be
agreed
that
we
do
not
imagine
the
annihilation
of
everything
but
it
will
be
claimed
that
we
can
conceive
it
we
conceive
a
polygon
with
a
thousand
sides
said
descartes
although
we
do
not
see
it
in
imagination
it
is
enough
that
we
can
clearly
represent
the
possibility
of
constructing
it
so
with
the
idea
of
the
annihilation
of
everything
nothing
simpler
it
will
be
said
than
the
procedure
by
which
we
construct
the
idea
of
it
there
is
in
fact
not
a
single
object
of
our
experience
that
we
can
not
suppose
annihilated
extend
this
annihilation
of
a
first
object
to
a
second
then
to
a
third
and
so
on
as
long
as
you
please
the
nought
is
the
limit
toward
which
the
operation
tends
and
the
nought
so
defined
is
the
annihilation
of
everything
that
is
the
theory
we
need
only
consider
it
in
this
form
to
see
the
absurdity
it
involves
an
idea
constructed
by
the
mind
is
an
idea
only
if
its
pieces
are
capable
of
coexisting
it
is
reduced
to
a
mere
word
if
the
elements
that
we
bring
together
to
compose
it
are
driven
away
as
fast
as
we
assemble
them
when
i
have
defined
the
circle
i
easily
represent
a
black
or
a
white
circle
a
circle
in
cardboard
iron
or
brass
a
transparent
or
an
opaque
circle
but
not
a
square
circle
because
the
law
of
the
generation
of
the
circle
excludes
the
possibility
of
defining
this
figure
with
straight
lines
so
my
mind
can
represent
any
existing
thing
whatever
as
annihilated
but
if
the
annihilation
of
anything
by
the
mind
is
an
operation
whose
mechanism
implies
that
it
works
on
a
part
of
the
whole
and
not
on
the
whole
itself
then
the
extension
of
such
an
operation
to
the
totality
of
things
becomes
and
absurd
and
the
idea
of
an
annihilation
of
everything
presents
the
same
character
as
that
of
a
square
circle
it
is
not
an
idea
it
is
only
a
word
so
let
us
examine
more
closely
the
mechanism
of
the
operation
in
fact
the
object
suppressed
is
either
external
or
internal
it
is
a
thing
or
it
is
a
state
of
consciousness
let
us
consider
the
first
case
i
annihilate
in
thought
an
external
object
in
the
place
where
it
was
there
is
no
longer
no
longer
anything
of
that
object
of
course
but
another
object
has
taken
its
place
there
is
no
absolute
void
in
nature
but
admit
that
an
absolute
void
is
possible
it
is
not
of
that
void
that
i
am
thinking
when
i
say
that
the
object
once
annihilated
leaves
its
place
unoccupied
for
by
the
hypothesis
it
is
a
that
is
a
void
limited
by
precise
outlines
or
in
other
words
a
kind
of
the
void
of
which
i
speak
therefore
is
at
bottom
only
the
absence
of
some
definite
object
which
was
here
at
first
is
now
elsewhere
and
in
so
far
as
it
is
no
longer
in
its
former
place
leaves
behind
it
so
to
speak
the
void
of
itself
a
being
unendowed
with
memory
or
prevision
would
not
use
the
words
void
or
nought
he
would
express
only
what
is
and
what
is
perceived
now
what
is
and
what
is
perceived
is
the
of
one
thing
or
of
another
never
the
of
anything
there
is
absence
only
for
a
being
capable
of
remembering
and
expecting
he
remembered
an
object
and
perhaps
expected
to
encounter
it
again
he
finds
another
and
he
expresses
the
disappointment
of
his
expectation
an
expectation
sprung
from
recollection
by
saying
that
he
no
longer
finds
anything
that
he
encounters
nothing
even
if
he
did
not
expect
to
encounter
the
object
it
is
a
possible
expectation
of
it
it
is
still
the
falsification
of
his
eventual
expectation
that
he
expresses
by
saying
that
the
object
is
no
longer
where
it
was
what
he
perceives
in
reality
what
he
will
succeed
in
effectively
thinking
of
is
the
presence
of
the
old
object
in
a
new
place
or
that
of
a
new
object
in
the
old
place
the
rest
all
that
is
expressed
negatively
by
such
words
as
nought
or
the
void
is
not
so
much
thought
as
feeling
or
to
speak
more
exactly
it
is
the
tinge
that
feeling
gives
to
thought
the
idea
of
annihilation
or
of
partial
nothingness
is
therefore
formed
here
in
the
course
of
the
substitution
of
one
thing
for
another
whenever
this
substitution
is
thought
by
a
mind
that
would
prefer
to
keep
the
old
thing
in
the
place
of
the
new
or
at
least
conceives
this
preference
as
possible
the
idea
implies
on
the
subjective
side
a
preference
on
the
objective
side
a
substitution
and
is
nothing
else
but
a
combination
of
or
rather
an
interference
between
this
feeling
of
preference
and
this
idea
of
substitution
such
is
the
mechanism
of
the
operation
by
which
our
mind
annihilates
an
object
and
succeeds
in
representing
in
the
external
world
a
partial
nought
let
us
now
see
how
it
represents
it
within
itself
we
find
in
ourselves
phenomena
that
are
produced
and
not
phenomena
that
are
not
produced
i
experience
a
sensation
or
an
emotion
i
conceive
an
idea
i
form
a
resolution
my
consciousness
perceives
these
facts
which
are
so
many
and
there
is
no
moment
in
which
facts
of
this
kind
are
not
present
to
me
i
can
no
doubt
interrupt
by
thought
the
course
of
my
inner
life
i
may
suppose
that
i
sleep
without
dreaming
or
that
i
have
ceased
to
exist
but
at
the
very
instant
when
i
make
this
supposition
i
conceive
myself
i
imagine
myself
watching
over
my
slumber
or
surviving
my
annihilation
and
i
give
up
perceiving
myself
from
within
only
by
taking
refuge
in
the
perception
of
myself
from
without
that
is
to
say
that
here
again
the
full
always
succeeds
the
full
and
that
an
intelligence
that
was
only
intelligence
that
had
neither
regret
nor
desire
whose
movement
was
governed
by
the
movement
of
its
object
could
not
even
conceive
an
absence
or
a
void
the
conception
of
a
void
arises
here
when
consciousness
lagging
behind
itself
remains
attached
to
the
recollection
of
an
old
state
when
another
state
is
already
present
it
is
only
a
comparison
between
what
is
and
what
could
or
ought
to
be
between
the
full
and
the
full
in
a
word
whether
it
be
a
void
of
matter
or
a
void
of
consciousness
representation
of
the
void
is
always
a
representation
which
is
full
and
which
resolves
itself
on
analysis
into
two
positive
elements
the
idea
distinct
or
confused
of
a
substitution
and
the
feeling
experienced
or
imagined
of
a
desire
or
a
it
follows
from
this
double
analysis
that
the
idea
of
the
absolute
nought
in
the
sense
of
the
annihilation
of
everything
is
a
idea
a
a
mere
word
if
suppressing
a
thing
consists
in
replacing
it
by
another
if
thinking
the
absence
of
one
thing
is
only
possible
by
the
more
or
less
explicit
representation
of
the
presence
of
some
other
thing
if
in
short
annihilation
signifies
before
anything
else
substitution
the
idea
of
an
annihilation
of
everything
is
as
absurd
as
that
of
a
square
circle
the
absurdity
is
not
obvious
because
there
exists
no
particular
object
that
can
not
be
supposed
annihilated
then
from
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
each
thing
in
turn
being
suppressed
in
thought
we
conclude
that
it
is
possible
to
suppose
them
suppressed
altogether
we
do
not
see
that
suppressing
each
thing
in
turn
consists
precisely
in
replacing
it
in
proportion
and
degree
by
another
and
therefore
that
the
suppression
of
absolutely
everything
implies
a
downright
contradiction
in
terms
since
the
operation
consists
in
destroying
the
very
condition
that
makes
the
operation
possible
but
the
illusion
is
tenacious
though
suppressing
one
thing
consists
in
substituting
another
for
it
we
do
not
conclude
we
are
unwilling
to
conclude
that
the
annihilation
of
a
thing
implies
the
substitution
in
thought
of
a
new
thing
for
the
old
we
agree
that
a
thing
is
always
replaced
by
another
thing
and
even
that
our
mind
can
not
think
the
disappearance
of
an
object
external
or
internal
without
thinking
under
an
indeterminate
and
confused
form
it
is
true
that
another
object
is
substituted
for
it
but
we
add
that
the
representation
of
a
disappearance
is
that
of
a
phenomenon
that
is
produced
in
space
or
at
least
in
time
that
consequently
it
still
implies
the
calling
up
of
an
image
and
that
it
is
precisely
here
that
we
have
to
free
ourselves
from
the
imagination
in
order
to
appeal
to
the
pure
understanding
let
us
therefore
no
longer
speak
it
will
be
said
of
disappearance
or
annihilation
these
are
physical
operations
let
us
no
longer
represent
the
object
a
as
annihilated
or
absent
let
us
say
simply
that
we
think
it
to
annihilate
it
is
to
act
on
it
in
time
and
perhaps
also
in
space
it
is
to
accept
consequently
the
condition
of
spatial
and
temporal
existence
to
accept
the
universal
connection
that
binds
an
object
to
all
others
and
prevents
it
from
disappearing
without
being
at
the
same
time
replaced
but
we
can
free
ourselves
from
these
conditions
all
that
is
necessary
is
that
by
an
effort
of
abstraction
we
should
call
up
the
idea
of
the
object
a
by
itself
that
we
should
agree
first
to
consider
it
as
existing
and
then
by
a
stroke
of
the
intellectual
pen
blot
out
the
clause
the
object
will
then
be
by
our
decree
very
well
let
us
strike
out
the
clause
we
must
not
suppose
that
our
is
that
it
can
be
isolated
from
the
rest
of
things
we
shall
see
that
it
carries
with
it
whether
we
will
or
no
all
that
we
tried
to
abstract
from
let
us
compare
together
the
two
ideas
the
object
a
supposed
to
exist
and
the
same
object
supposed
the
idea
of
the
object
a
supposed
existent
is
the
representation
pure
and
simple
of
the
object
a
for
we
can
not
represent
an
object
without
attributing
to
it
by
the
very
fact
of
representing
it
a
certain
reality
between
thinking
an
object
and
thinking
it
existent
there
is
absolutely
no
difference
kant
has
put
this
point
in
clear
light
in
his
criticism
of
the
ontological
argument
then
what
is
it
to
think
the
object
a
to
represent
it
can
not
consist
in
withdrawing
from
the
idea
of
the
object
a
the
idea
of
the
attribute
existence
since
i
repeat
the
representation
of
the
existence
of
the
object
is
inseparable
from
the
representation
of
the
object
and
indeed
is
one
with
it
to
represent
the
object
a
can
only
consist
therefore
in
something
to
the
idea
of
this
object
we
add
to
it
in
fact
the
idea
of
an
of
this
particular
object
by
actual
reality
in
general
to
think
the
object
a
as
is
first
to
think
the
object
and
consequently
to
think
it
existent
it
is
then
to
think
that
another
reality
with
which
it
is
incompatible
supplants
it
only
it
is
useless
to
represent
this
latter
reality
explicitly
we
are
not
concerned
with
what
it
is
it
is
enough
for
us
to
know
that
it
drives
out
the
object
a
which
alone
is
of
interest
to
us
that
is
why
we
think
of
the
expulsion
rather
than
of
the
cause
which
expels
but
this
cause
is
none
the
less
present
to
the
mind
it
is
there
in
the
implicit
state
that
which
expels
being
inseparable
from
the
expulsion
as
the
hand
which
drives
the
pen
is
inseparable
from
the
the
act
by
which
we
declare
an
object
unreal
therefore
posits
the
existence
of
the
real
in
general
in
other
words
to
represent
an
object
as
unreal
can
not
consist
in
depriving
it
of
every
kind
of
existence
since
the
representation
of
an
object
is
necessarily
that
of
the
object
existing
such
an
act
consists
simply
in
declaring
that
the
existence
attached
by
our
mind
to
the
object
and
inseparable
from
its
representation
is
an
existence
wholly
ideal
that
of
a
mere
but
the
ideality
of
an
object
and
the
simple
possibility
of
an
object
have
meaning
only
in
relation
to
a
reality
that
drives
into
the
region
of
the
ideal
or
of
the
merely
possible
the
object
which
is
incompatible
with
it
suppose
the
stronger
and
more
substantial
existence
annihilated
it
is
the
attenuated
and
weaker
existence
of
the
merely
possible
that
becomes
the
reality
itself
and
you
will
no
longer
be
representing
the
object
then
as
in
other
words
and
however
strange
our
assertion
may
seem
more
less
the
idea
of
an
object
conceived
as
not
existing
than
in
the
idea
of
this
same
object
conceived
as
existing
for
the
idea
of
the
object
not
existing
is
necessarily
the
idea
of
the
object
existing
with
in
addition
the
representation
of
an
exclusion
of
this
object
by
the
actual
reality
taken
in
but
it
will
be
claimed
that
our
idea
of
the
is
not
yet
sufficiently
cut
loose
from
every
imaginative
element
that
it
is
not
negative
enough
no
matter
we
shall
be
told
though
the
unreality
of
a
thing
consist
in
its
exclusion
by
other
things
we
want
to
know
nothing
about
that
are
we
not
free
to
direct
our
attention
where
we
please
and
how
we
please
well
then
after
having
called
up
the
idea
of
an
object
and
thereby
if
you
will
have
it
so
supposed
it
existent
we
shall
merely
couple
to
our
affirmation
a
and
that
will
be
enough
to
make
us
think
it
this
is
an
operation
entirely
intellectual
independent
of
what
happens
outside
the
mind
so
let
us
think
of
anything
or
let
us
think
of
the
totality
of
things
and
then
write
in
the
margin
of
our
thought
the
which
prescribes
the
rejection
of
what
it
contains
we
annihilate
everything
mentally
by
the
mere
fact
of
decreeing
its
annihilation
here
we
have
it
the
very
root
of
all
the
difficulties
and
errors
with
which
we
are
confronted
is
to
be
found
in
the
power
ascribed
here
to
negation
we
represent
negation
as
exactly
symmetrical
with
affirmation
we
imagine
that
negation
like
affirmation
is
so
that
negation
like
affirmation
would
have
the
power
of
creating
ideas
with
this
sole
difference
that
they
would
be
negative
ideas
by
affirming
one
thing
and
then
another
and
so
on
i
form
the
idea
of
all
so
by
denying
one
thing
and
then
other
things
finally
by
denying
all
i
arrive
at
the
idea
of
but
it
is
just
this
assimilation
which
is
arbitrary
we
fail
to
see
that
while
affirmation
is
a
complete
act
of
the
mind
which
can
succeed
in
building
up
an
idea
negation
is
but
the
half
of
an
intellectual
act
of
which
the
other
half
is
understood
or
rather
put
off
to
an
indefinite
future
we
fail
to
see
that
while
affirmation
is
a
purely
intellectual
act
there
enters
into
negation
an
element
which
is
not
intellectual
and
that
it
is
precisely
to
the
intrusion
of
this
foreign
element
that
negation
owes
its
specific
character
to
begin
with
the
second
point
let
us
note
that
to
deny
always
consists
in
setting
aside
a
possible
affirmation
negation
is
only
an
attitude
taken
by
the
mind
toward
an
eventual
affirmation
when
i
say
this
table
is
black
i
am
speaking
of
the
table
i
have
seen
it
black
and
my
judgment
expresses
what
i
have
seen
but
if
i
say
this
table
is
not
white
i
surely
do
not
express
something
i
have
perceived
for
i
have
seen
black
and
not
an
absence
of
white
it
is
therefore
at
bottom
not
on
the
table
itself
that
i
bring
this
judgment
to
bear
but
rather
on
the
judgment
that
would
declare
the
table
white
i
judge
a
judgment
and
not
the
table
the
proposition
this
table
is
not
white
implies
that
you
might
believe
it
white
that
you
did
believe
it
such
or
that
i
was
going
to
believe
it
such
i
warn
you
or
myself
that
this
judgment
is
to
be
replaced
by
another
which
it
is
true
i
leave
undetermined
thus
while
affirmation
bears
directly
on
the
thing
negation
aims
at
the
thing
only
indirectly
through
an
interposed
affirmation
an
affirmative
proposition
expresses
a
judgment
on
an
object
a
negative
proposition
expresses
a
judgment
on
a
judgment
therefore
differs
from
affirmation
properly
so
called
in
that
it
is
an
affirmation
of
the
second
degree
it
affirms
something
of
an
affirmation
which
itself
affirms
something
of
an
but
it
follows
at
once
from
this
that
negation
is
not
the
work
of
pure
mind
i
should
say
of
a
mind
placed
before
objects
and
concerned
with
them
alone
when
we
deny
we
give
a
lesson
to
others
or
it
may
be
to
ourselves
we
take
to
task
an
interlocutor
real
or
possible
whom
we
find
mistaken
and
whom
we
put
on
his
guard
he
was
affirming
something
we
tell
him
he
ought
to
affirm
something
else
though
without
specifying
the
affirmation
which
must
be
substituted
there
is
no
longer
then
simply
a
person
and
an
object
there
is
in
face
of
the
object
a
person
speaking
to
a
person
opposing
him
and
aiding
him
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
beginning
of
society
negation
aims
at
some
one
and
not
only
like
a
purely
intellectual
operation
at
some
thing
it
is
of
a
pedagogical
and
social
nature
it
sets
straight
or
rather
warns
the
person
warned
and
set
straight
being
possibly
by
a
kind
of
doubling
the
very
person
that
speaks
so
much
for
the
second
point
now
for
the
first
we
said
that
negation
is
but
the
half
of
an
intellectual
act
of
which
the
other
half
is
left
indeterminate
if
i
pronounce
the
negative
proposition
this
table
is
not
white
i
mean
that
you
ought
to
substitute
for
your
judgment
the
table
is
white
another
judgment
i
give
you
an
admonition
and
the
admonition
refers
to
the
necessity
of
a
substitution
as
to
what
you
ought
to
substitute
for
your
affirmation
i
tell
you
nothing
it
is
true
this
may
be
because
i
do
not
know
the
color
of
the
table
but
it
is
also
it
is
indeed
even
more
because
the
white
color
is
that
alone
that
interests
us
for
the
moment
so
that
i
only
need
to
tell
you
that
some
other
color
will
have
to
be
substituted
for
white
without
having
to
say
which
a
negative
judgment
is
therefore
really
one
which
indicates
a
need
of
substituting
for
an
affirmative
judgment
another
affirmative
judgment
the
nature
of
which
however
is
not
specified
sometimes
because
it
is
not
known
more
often
because
it
fails
to
offer
any
actual
interest
the
attention
bearing
only
on
the
substance
of
the
first
thus
whenever
i
add
a
not
to
an
affirmation
whenever
i
deny
i
perform
two
very
definite
acts
i
interest
myself
in
what
one
of
my
affirms
or
in
what
he
was
going
to
say
or
in
what
might
have
been
said
by
another
whom
i
anticipate
i
announce
that
some
other
affirmation
whose
content
i
do
not
specify
will
have
to
be
substituted
for
the
one
i
find
before
me
now
in
neither
of
these
two
acts
is
there
anything
but
affirmation
the
character
of
negation
is
due
to
superimposing
the
first
of
these
acts
upon
the
second
it
is
in
vain
then
that
we
attribute
to
negation
the
power
of
creating
ideas
symmetrical
with
those
that
affirmation
creates
and
directed
in
a
contrary
sense
no
idea
will
come
forth
from
negation
for
it
has
no
other
content
than
that
of
the
affirmative
judgment
which
it
judges
to
be
more
precise
let
us
consider
an
existential
instead
of
an
attributive
judgment
if
i
say
the
object
a
does
not
exist
i
mean
by
that
first
that
we
might
believe
that
the
object
a
exists
how
indeed
can
we
think
of
the
object
a
without
thinking
it
existing
and
once
again
what
difference
can
there
be
between
the
idea
of
the
object
a
existing
and
the
idea
pure
and
simple
of
the
object
a
therefore
merely
by
saying
the
object
a
i
attribute
to
it
some
kind
of
existence
though
it
be
that
of
a
mere
that
is
to
say
of
a
pure
idea
and
consequently
in
the
judgment
the
object
a
is
not
there
is
at
first
an
affirmation
such
as
the
object
a
has
been
or
the
object
a
will
be
or
more
generally
the
object
a
exists
at
least
as
a
mere
now
when
i
add
the
two
words
is
not
i
can
only
mean
that
if
we
go
further
if
we
erect
the
possible
object
into
a
real
object
we
shall
be
mistaken
and
that
the
possible
of
which
i
am
speaking
is
excluded
from
the
actual
reality
as
incompatible
with
it
judgments
that
posit
the
of
a
thing
are
therefore
judgments
that
formulate
a
contrast
between
the
possible
and
the
actual
that
is
between
two
kinds
of
one
thought
and
the
other
found
where
a
person
real
or
imaginary
wrongly
believes
that
a
certain
possible
is
realized
instead
of
this
possible
there
is
a
reality
that
differs
from
it
and
rejects
it
the
negative
judgment
expresses
this
contrast
but
it
expresses
the
contrast
in
an
intentionally
incomplete
form
because
it
is
addressed
to
a
person
who
is
supposed
to
be
interested
exclusively
in
the
possible
that
is
indicated
and
is
not
concerned
to
know
by
what
kind
of
reality
the
possible
is
replaced
the
expression
of
the
substitution
is
therefore
bound
to
be
cut
short
instead
of
affirming
that
a
second
term
is
substituted
for
the
first
the
attention
which
was
originally
directed
to
the
first
term
will
be
kept
fixed
upon
it
and
upon
it
alone
and
without
going
beyond
the
first
we
shall
implicitly
affirm
that
a
second
term
replaces
it
in
saying
that
the
first
is
not
we
shall
thus
judge
a
judgment
instead
of
judging
a
thing
we
shall
warn
others
or
warn
ourselves
of
a
possible
error
instead
of
supplying
positive
information
suppress
every
intention
of
this
kind
give
knowledge
back
its
exclusively
scientific
or
philosophical
character
suppose
in
other
words
that
reality
comes
itself
to
inscribe
itself
on
a
mind
that
cares
only
for
things
and
is
not
interested
in
persons
we
shall
affirm
that
such
or
such
a
thing
is
we
shall
never
affirm
that
a
thing
is
not
how
comes
it
then
that
affirmation
and
negation
are
so
persistently
put
on
the
same
level
and
endowed
with
an
equal
objectivity
how
comes
it
that
we
have
so
much
difficulty
in
recognizing
that
negation
is
subjective
artificially
cut
short
relative
to
the
human
mind
and
still
more
to
the
social
life
the
reason
is
no
doubt
that
negation
and
affirmation
are
expressed
in
propositions
and
that
proposition
being
formed
of
which
symbolize
is
something
relative
to
social
life
and
to
the
human
intellect
whether
i
say
the
ground
is
damp
or
the
ground
is
not
damp
in
both
cases
the
terms
ground
and
damp
are
concepts
more
or
less
artificially
created
by
the
mind
of
man
extracted
by
his
free
initiative
from
the
continuity
of
experience
in
both
cases
the
concepts
are
represented
by
the
same
conventional
words
in
both
cases
we
can
say
indeed
that
the
proposition
aims
at
a
social
and
pedagogical
end
since
the
first
would
propagate
a
truth
as
the
second
would
prevent
an
error
from
this
point
of
view
which
is
that
of
formal
logic
to
affirm
and
to
deny
are
indeed
two
mutually
symmetrical
acts
of
which
the
first
establishes
a
relation
of
agreement
and
the
second
a
relation
of
disagreement
between
a
subject
and
an
attribute
but
how
do
we
fail
to
see
that
the
symmetry
is
altogether
external
and
the
likeness
superficial
suppose
language
fallen
into
disuse
society
dissolved
every
intellectual
initiative
every
faculty
of
and
of
atrophied
in
man
the
dampness
of
the
ground
will
subsist
none
the
less
capable
of
inscribing
itself
automatically
in
sensation
and
of
sending
a
vague
idea
to
the
deadened
intellect
the
intellect
will
still
affirm
in
implicit
terms
and
consequently
neither
distinct
concepts
nor
words
nor
the
desire
of
spreading
the
truth
nor
that
of
bettering
oneself
are
of
the
very
essence
of
the
affirmation
but
this
passive
intelligence
mechanically
keeping
step
with
experience
neither
anticipating
nor
following
the
course
of
the
real
would
have
no
wish
to
deny
it
could
not
receive
an
imprint
of
negation
for
once
again
that
which
exists
may
come
to
be
recorded
but
the
of
the
can
not
for
such
an
intellect
to
reach
the
point
of
denying
it
must
awake
from
its
torpor
formulate
the
disappointment
of
a
real
or
possible
expectation
correct
an
actual
or
possible
error
in
short
propose
to
teach
others
or
to
teach
itself
it
is
rather
difficult
to
perceive
this
in
the
example
we
have
chosen
but
the
example
is
indeed
the
more
instructive
and
the
argument
the
more
cogent
on
that
account
if
dampness
is
able
automatically
to
come
and
record
itself
it
is
the
same
it
will
be
said
with
for
the
dry
as
well
as
the
damp
can
give
impressions
to
sense
which
will
transmit
them
as
more
or
less
distinct
ideas
to
the
intelligence
in
this
sense
the
negation
of
dampness
is
as
objective
a
thing
as
purely
intellectual
as
remote
from
every
pedagogical
intention
as
but
let
us
look
at
it
more
closely
we
shall
see
that
the
negative
proposition
the
ground
is
not
damp
and
the
affirmative
proposition
the
ground
is
dry
have
entirely
different
contents
the
second
implies
that
we
know
the
dry
that
we
have
experienced
the
specific
sensations
tactile
or
visual
for
example
that
are
at
the
base
of
this
idea
the
first
requires
nothing
of
the
sort
it
could
equally
well
have
been
formulated
by
an
intelligent
fish
who
had
never
perceived
anything
but
the
wet
it
would
be
necessary
it
is
true
that
this
fish
should
have
risen
to
the
distinction
between
the
real
and
the
possible
and
that
he
should
care
to
anticipate
the
error
of
his
who
doubtless
consider
as
alone
possible
the
condition
of
wetness
in
which
they
actually
live
keep
strictly
to
the
terms
of
the
proposition
the
ground
is
not
damp
and
you
will
find
that
it
means
two
things
that
one
might
believe
that
the
ground
is
damp
that
the
dampness
is
replaced
in
fact
by
a
certain
quality
this
quality
is
left
indeterminate
either
because
we
have
no
positive
knowledge
of
it
or
because
it
has
no
actual
interest
for
the
person
to
whom
the
negation
is
addressed
to
deny
therefore
always
consists
in
presenting
in
an
abridged
form
a
system
of
two
affirmations
the
one
determinate
which
applies
to
a
certain
the
other
indeterminate
referring
to
the
unknown
or
indifferent
reality
that
supplants
this
possibility
the
second
affirmation
is
virtually
contained
in
the
judgment
we
apply
to
the
first
a
judgment
which
is
negation
itself
and
what
gives
negation
its
subjective
character
is
precisely
this
that
in
the
discovery
of
a
replacement
it
takes
account
only
of
the
replaced
and
is
not
concerned
with
what
replaces
the
replaced
exists
only
as
a
conception
of
the
mind
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
continue
to
see
it
and
consequently
in
order
to
speak
of
it
to
turn
our
back
on
the
reality
which
flows
from
the
past
to
the
present
advancing
from
behind
it
is
this
that
we
do
when
we
deny
we
discover
the
change
or
more
generally
the
substitution
as
a
traveller
would
see
the
course
of
his
carriage
if
he
looked
out
behind
and
only
knew
at
each
moment
the
point
at
which
he
had
ceased
to
be
he
could
never
determine
his
actual
position
except
by
relation
to
that
which
he
had
just
quitted
instead
of
grasping
it
in
itself
to
sum
up
for
a
mind
which
should
follow
purely
and
simply
the
thread
of
experience
there
would
be
no
void
no
nought
even
relative
or
partial
no
possible
negation
such
a
mind
would
see
facts
succeed
facts
states
succeed
states
things
succeed
things
what
it
would
note
at
each
moment
would
be
things
existing
states
appearing
events
happening
it
would
live
in
the
actual
and
if
it
were
capable
of
judging
it
would
never
affirm
anything
except
the
existence
of
the
present
endow
this
mind
with
memory
and
especially
with
the
desire
to
dwell
on
the
past
give
it
the
faculty
of
dissociating
and
of
distinguishing
it
will
no
longer
only
note
the
present
state
of
the
passing
reality
it
will
represent
the
passing
as
a
change
and
therefore
as
a
contrast
between
what
has
been
and
what
is
and
as
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
a
past
that
we
remember
and
a
past
that
we
imagine
it
will
quickly
rise
to
the
idea
of
the
possible
in
general
it
will
thus
be
shunted
on
to
the
siding
of
negation
and
especially
it
will
be
at
the
point
of
representing
a
disappearance
but
it
will
not
yet
have
reached
it
to
represent
that
a
thing
has
disappeared
it
is
not
enough
to
perceive
a
contrast
between
the
past
and
the
present
it
is
necessary
besides
to
turn
our
back
on
the
present
to
dwell
on
the
past
and
to
think
the
contrast
of
the
past
with
the
present
in
terms
of
the
past
only
without
letting
the
present
appear
in
it
the
idea
of
annihilation
is
therefore
not
a
pure
idea
it
implies
that
we
regret
the
past
or
that
we
conceive
it
as
regrettable
that
we
have
some
reason
to
linger
over
it
the
idea
arises
when
the
phenomenon
of
substitution
is
cut
in
two
by
a
mind
which
considers
only
the
first
half
because
that
alone
interests
it
suppress
all
interest
all
feeling
and
there
is
nothing
left
but
the
reality
that
flows
together
with
the
knowledge
ever
renewed
that
it
impresses
on
us
of
its
present
state
from
annihilation
to
negation
which
is
a
more
general
operation
there
is
now
only
a
step
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
represent
the
contrast
of
what
is
not
only
with
what
has
been
but
also
with
all
that
might
have
been
and
we
must
express
this
contrast
as
a
function
of
what
might
have
been
and
not
of
what
is
we
must
affirm
the
existence
of
the
actual
while
looking
only
at
the
possible
the
formula
we
thus
obtain
no
longer
expresses
merely
a
disappointment
of
the
individual
it
is
made
to
correct
or
guard
against
an
error
which
is
rather
supposed
to
be
the
error
of
another
in
this
sense
negation
has
a
pedagogical
and
social
character
now
once
negation
is
formulated
it
presents
an
aspect
symmetrical
with
that
of
affirmation
if
affirmation
affirms
an
objective
reality
it
seems
that
negation
must
affirm
a
equally
objective
and
so
to
say
equally
real
in
which
we
are
both
right
and
wrong
wrong
because
negation
can
not
be
objectified
in
so
far
as
it
is
negative
right
however
in
that
the
negation
of
a
thing
implies
the
latent
affirmation
of
its
replacement
by
something
else
which
we
systematically
leave
on
one
side
but
the
negative
form
of
negation
benefits
by
the
affirmation
at
the
bottom
of
it
bestriding
the
positive
solid
reality
to
which
it
is
attached
this
phantom
objectifies
itself
thus
is
formed
the
idea
of
the
void
or
of
a
partial
nought
a
thing
being
supposed
to
be
replaced
not
by
another
thing
but
by
a
void
which
it
leaves
that
is
by
the
negation
of
itself
now
as
this
operation
works
on
anything
whatever
we
suppose
it
performed
on
each
thing
in
turn
and
finally
on
all
things
in
block
we
thus
obtain
the
idea
of
absolute
nothing
if
now
we
analyze
this
idea
of
nothing
we
find
that
it
is
at
bottom
the
idea
of
everything
together
with
a
movement
of
the
mind
that
keeps
jumping
from
one
thing
to
another
refuses
to
stand
still
and
concentrates
all
its
attention
on
this
refusal
by
never
determining
its
actual
position
except
by
relation
to
that
which
it
has
just
left
it
is
therefore
an
idea
eminently
comprehensive
and
full
as
full
and
comprehensive
as
the
idea
of
to
which
it
is
very
closely
akin
how
then
can
the
idea
of
nought
be
opposed
to
that
of
all
is
it
not
plain
that
this
is
to
oppose
the
full
to
the
full
and
that
the
question
why
does
something
exist
is
consequently
without
meaning
a
raised
about
a
yet
we
must
say
once
more
why
this
phantom
of
a
problem
haunts
the
mind
with
such
obstinacy
in
vain
do
we
show
that
in
the
idea
of
an
annihilation
of
the
real
there
is
only
the
image
of
all
realities
expelling
one
another
endlessly
in
a
circle
in
vain
do
we
add
that
the
idea
of
is
only
that
of
the
expulsion
of
an
imponderable
existence
or
a
merely
possible
existence
by
a
more
substantial
existence
which
would
then
be
the
true
reality
in
vain
do
we
find
in
the
form
of
negation
an
element
which
is
not
intellectual
negation
being
the
judgment
of
a
judgment
an
admonition
given
to
some
one
else
or
to
oneself
so
that
it
is
absurd
to
attribute
to
negation
the
power
of
creating
ideas
of
a
new
kind
viz
ideas
without
content
in
spite
of
all
the
conviction
persists
that
before
things
or
at
least
under
things
there
is
nothing
if
we
seek
the
reason
of
this
fact
we
shall
find
it
precisely
in
the
feeling
in
the
social
and
so
to
speak
practical
element
that
gives
its
specific
form
to
negation
the
greatest
philosophic
difficulties
arise
as
we
have
said
from
the
fact
that
the
forms
of
human
action
venture
outside
of
their
proper
sphere
we
are
made
in
order
to
act
as
much
as
and
more
than
in
order
to
think
or
rather
when
we
follow
the
bent
of
our
nature
it
is
in
order
to
act
that
we
think
it
is
therefore
no
wonder
that
the
habits
of
action
give
their
tone
to
those
of
thought
and
that
our
mind
always
perceives
things
in
the
same
order
in
which
we
are
accustomed
to
picture
them
when
we
propose
to
act
on
them
now
it
is
unquestionable
as
we
remarked
above
that
every
human
action
has
its
in
a
dissatisfaction
and
thereby
in
a
feeling
of
absence
we
should
not
act
if
we
did
not
set
before
ourselves
an
end
and
we
seek
a
thing
only
because
we
feel
the
lack
of
it
our
action
proceeds
thus
from
nothing
to
something
and
its
very
essence
is
to
embroider
something
on
the
canvas
of
nothing
the
truth
is
that
the
nothing
concerned
here
is
the
absence
not
so
much
of
a
thing
as
of
a
utility
if
i
bring
a
visitor
into
a
room
that
i
have
not
yet
furnished
i
say
to
him
that
there
is
nothing
in
it
yet
i
know
the
room
is
full
of
air
but
as
we
do
not
sit
on
air
the
room
truly
contains
nothing
that
at
this
moment
for
the
visitor
and
for
myself
counts
for
anything
in
a
general
way
human
work
consists
in
creating
utility
and
as
long
as
the
work
is
not
done
there
is
nothing
nothing
that
we
want
our
life
is
thus
spent
in
filling
voids
which
our
intellect
conceives
under
the
influence
by
no
means
intellectual
of
desire
and
of
regret
under
the
pressure
of
vital
necessities
and
if
we
mean
by
void
an
absence
of
utility
and
not
of
things
we
may
say
in
this
quite
relative
sense
that
we
are
constantly
going
from
the
void
to
the
full
such
is
the
direction
which
our
action
takes
our
speculation
can
not
help
doing
the
same
and
naturally
it
passes
from
the
relative
sense
to
the
absolute
sense
since
it
is
exercised
on
things
themselves
and
not
on
the
utility
they
have
for
us
thus
is
implanted
in
us
the
idea
that
reality
fills
a
void
and
that
nothing
conceived
as
an
absence
of
everything
before
all
things
in
right
if
not
in
fact
it
is
this
illusion
that
we
have
tried
to
remove
by
showing
that
the
idea
of
nothing
if
we
try
to
see
in
it
that
of
an
annihilation
of
all
things
is
and
reduced
to
a
mere
word
and
that
if
on
the
contrary
it
is
truly
an
idea
then
we
find
in
it
as
much
matter
as
in
the
idea
of
all
this
long
analysis
has
been
necessary
to
show
that
reality
is
not
necessarily
a
reality
foreign
to
if
we
pass
consciously
or
unconsciously
through
the
idea
of
the
nought
in
order
to
reach
that
of
being
the
being
to
which
we
come
is
a
logical
or
mathematical
essence
therefore
and
consequently
a
static
conception
of
the
real
is
forced
on
us
everything
appears
given
once
for
all
in
eternity
but
we
must
accustom
ourselves
to
think
being
directly
without
making
a
detour
without
first
appealing
to
the
phantom
of
the
nought
which
interposes
itself
between
it
and
us
we
must
strive
to
see
in
order
to
see
and
no
longer
to
see
in
order
to
act
then
the
absolute
is
revealed
very
near
us
and
in
a
certain
measure
in
us
it
is
of
psychological
and
not
of
mathematical
nor
logical
essence
it
lives
with
us
like
us
but
in
certain
aspects
infinitely
more
concentrated
and
more
gathered
up
in
itself
it
but
do
we
ever
think
true
duration
here
again
a
direct
taking
possession
is
necessary
it
is
no
use
trying
to
approach
duration
we
must
install
ourselves
within
it
straight
away
this
is
what
the
intellect
generally
refuses
to
do
accustomed
as
it
is
to
think
the
moving
by
means
of
the
unmovable
the
function
of
the
intellect
is
to
preside
over
actions
now
in
action
it
is
the
result
that
interests
us
the
means
matter
little
provided
the
end
is
attained
thence
it
comes
that
we
are
altogether
bent
on
the
end
to
be
realized
generally
trusting
ourselves
to
it
in
order
that
the
idea
may
become
an
act
and
thence
it
comes
also
that
only
the
goal
where
our
activity
will
rest
is
pictured
explicitly
to
our
mind
the
movements
constituting
the
action
itself
either
elude
our
consciousness
or
reach
it
only
confusedly
let
us
consider
a
very
simple
act
like
that
of
lifting
the
arm
where
should
we
be
if
we
had
to
imagine
beforehand
all
the
elementary
contractions
and
tensions
this
act
involves
or
even
to
perceive
them
one
by
one
as
they
are
accomplished
but
the
mind
is
carried
immediately
to
the
end
that
is
to
say
to
the
schematic
and
simplified
vision
of
the
act
supposed
accomplished
then
if
no
antagonistic
idea
neutralizes
the
effect
of
the
first
idea
the
appropriate
movements
come
of
themselves
to
fill
out
the
plan
drawn
in
some
way
by
the
void
of
its
gaps
the
intellect
then
only
represents
to
the
activity
ends
to
attain
that
is
to
say
points
of
rest
and
from
one
end
attained
to
another
end
attained
from
one
rest
to
another
rest
our
activity
is
carried
by
a
series
of
leaps
during
which
our
consciousness
is
turned
away
as
much
as
possible
from
the
movement
going
on
to
regard
only
the
anticipated
image
of
the
movement
accomplished
now
in
order
that
it
may
represent
as
unmovable
the
result
of
the
act
which
is
being
accomplished
the
intellect
must
perceive
as
also
unmovable
the
surroundings
in
which
this
result
is
being
framed
our
activity
is
fitted
into
the
material
world
if
matter
appeared
to
us
as
a
perpetual
flowing
we
should
assign
no
termination
to
any
of
our
actions
we
should
feel
each
of
them
dissolve
as
fast
as
it
was
accomplished
and
we
should
not
anticipate
an
future
in
order
that
our
activity
may
leap
from
an
to
an
it
is
necessary
that
matter
should
pass
from
a
to
a
for
it
is
only
into
a
state
of
the
material
world
that
action
can
fit
a
result
so
as
to
be
accomplished
but
is
it
thus
that
matter
presents
itself
we
may
presume
that
our
perception
manages
to
apprehend
matter
with
this
bias
sensory
organs
and
motor
organs
are
in
fact
coördinated
with
each
other
now
the
first
symbolize
our
faculty
of
perceiving
as
the
second
our
faculty
of
acting
the
organism
thus
evidences
in
a
visible
and
tangible
form
the
perfect
accord
of
perception
and
action
so
if
our
activity
always
aims
at
a
into
which
it
is
momentarily
fitted
our
perception
must
retain
of
the
material
world
at
every
moment
only
a
in
which
it
is
provisionally
placed
this
is
the
most
natural
hypothesis
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
experience
confirms
it
from
our
first
glance
at
the
world
before
we
even
make
our
in
it
we
distinguish
color
succeeds
to
color
sound
to
sound
resistance
to
resistance
etc
each
of
these
qualities
taken
separately
is
a
state
that
seems
to
persist
as
such
immovable
until
another
replaces
it
yet
each
of
these
qualities
resolves
itself
on
analysis
into
an
enormous
number
of
elementary
movements
whether
we
see
in
it
vibrations
or
whether
we
represent
it
in
any
other
way
one
fact
is
certain
it
is
that
every
quality
is
change
in
vain
moreover
shall
we
seek
beneath
the
change
the
thing
which
changes
it
is
always
provisionally
and
in
order
to
satisfy
our
imagination
that
we
attach
the
movement
to
a
mobile
the
mobile
flies
for
ever
before
the
pursuit
of
science
which
is
concerned
with
mobility
alone
in
the
smallest
discernible
fraction
of
a
second
in
the
almost
instantaneous
perception
of
a
sensible
quality
there
may
be
trillions
of
oscillations
which
repeat
themselves
the
permanence
of
a
sensible
quality
consists
in
this
repetition
of
movements
as
the
persistence
of
life
consists
in
a
series
of
palpitations
the
primal
function
of
perception
is
precisely
to
grasp
a
series
of
elementary
changes
under
the
form
of
a
quality
or
of
a
simple
state
by
a
work
of
condensation
the
greater
the
power
of
acting
bestowed
upon
an
animal
species
the
more
numerous
probably
are
the
elementary
changes
that
its
faculty
of
perceiving
concentrates
into
one
of
its
instants
and
the
progress
must
be
continuous
in
nature
from
the
beings
that
vibrate
almost
in
unison
with
the
oscillations
of
the
ether
up
to
those
that
embrace
trillions
of
these
oscillations
in
the
shortest
of
their
simple
perceptions
the
first
feel
hardly
anything
but
movements
the
others
perceive
quality
the
first
are
almost
caught
up
in
the
of
things
the
others
react
and
the
tension
of
their
faculty
of
acting
is
probably
proportional
to
the
concentration
of
their
faculty
of
perceiving
the
progress
goes
on
even
in
humanity
itself
a
man
is
so
much
the
more
a
man
of
action
as
he
can
embrace
in
a
glance
a
greater
number
of
events
he
who
perceives
successive
events
one
by
one
will
allow
himself
to
be
led
by
them
he
who
grasps
them
as
a
whole
will
dominate
them
in
short
the
qualities
of
matter
are
so
many
stable
views
that
we
take
of
its
instability
now
in
the
continuity
of
sensible
qualities
we
mark
off
the
boundaries
of
bodies
each
of
these
bodies
really
changes
at
every
moment
in
the
first
place
it
resolves
itself
into
a
group
of
qualities
and
every
quality
as
we
said
consists
of
a
succession
of
elementary
movements
but
even
if
we
regard
the
quality
as
a
stable
state
the
body
is
still
unstable
in
that
it
changes
qualities
without
ceasing
the
body
that
which
we
are
most
justified
in
isolating
within
the
continuity
of
matter
because
it
constitutes
a
relatively
closed
system
is
the
living
body
it
is
moreover
for
it
that
we
cut
out
the
others
within
the
whole
now
life
is
an
evolution
we
concentrate
a
period
of
this
evolution
in
a
stable
view
which
we
call
a
form
and
when
the
change
has
become
considerable
enough
to
overcome
the
fortunate
inertia
of
our
perception
we
say
that
the
body
has
changed
its
form
but
in
reality
the
body
is
changing
form
at
every
moment
or
rather
there
is
no
form
since
form
is
immobile
and
the
reality
is
movement
what
is
real
is
the
continual
form
is
only
a
snapshot
view
of
a
therefore
here
again
our
perception
manages
to
solidify
into
discontinuous
images
the
fluid
continuity
of
the
real
when
the
successive
images
do
not
differ
from
each
other
too
much
we
consider
them
all
as
the
waxing
and
waning
of
a
single
image
or
as
the
deformation
of
this
image
in
different
directions
and
to
this
mean
we
really
allude
when
we
speak
of
the
of
a
thing
or
of
the
thing
itself
finally
things
once
constituted
show
on
the
surface
by
their
changes
of
situation
the
profound
changes
that
are
being
accomplished
within
the
whole
we
say
then
that
they
on
one
another
this
action
appears
to
us
no
doubt
in
the
form
of
movement
but
from
the
mobility
of
the
movement
we
turn
away
as
much
as
we
can
what
interests
us
is
as
we
said
above
the
unmovable
plan
of
the
movement
rather
than
the
movement
itself
is
it
a
simple
movement
we
ask
ourselves
it
is
going
it
is
by
its
direction
that
is
to
say
by
the
position
of
its
provisional
end
that
we
represent
it
at
every
moment
is
it
a
complex
movement
we
would
know
above
all
is
going
on
the
movement
is
doing
in
other
words
the
obtained
or
the
presiding
examine
closely
what
is
in
your
mind
when
you
speak
of
an
action
in
course
of
accomplishment
the
idea
of
change
is
there
i
am
willing
to
grant
but
it
is
hidden
in
the
penumbra
in
the
full
light
is
the
motionless
plan
of
the
act
supposed
accomplished
it
is
by
this
and
by
this
only
that
the
complex
act
is
distinguished
and
defined
we
should
be
very
much
embarrassed
if
we
had
to
imagine
the
movements
inherent
in
the
actions
of
eating
drinking
fighting
etc
it
is
enough
for
us
to
know
in
a
general
and
indefinite
way
that
all
these
acts
are
movements
once
that
side
of
the
matter
has
been
settled
we
simply
seek
to
represent
the
of
each
of
these
complex
movements
that
is
to
say
the
that
underlies
them
here
again
knowledge
bears
on
a
state
rather
than
on
a
change
it
is
therefore
the
same
with
this
third
case
as
with
the
others
whether
the
movement
be
qualitative
or
evolutionary
or
extensive
the
mind
manages
to
take
stable
views
of
the
instability
and
thence
the
mind
derives
as
we
have
just
shown
three
kinds
of
representations
qualities
forms
of
essences
acts
to
these
three
ways
of
seeing
correspond
three
categories
of
words
and
which
are
the
primordial
elements
of
language
adjectives
and
substantives
therefore
symbolize
but
the
verb
itself
if
we
keep
to
the
clear
part
of
the
idea
it
calls
up
hardly
expresses
anything
else
now
if
we
try
to
characterize
more
precisely
our
natural
attitude
towards
becoming
this
is
what
we
find
becoming
is
infinitely
varied
that
which
goes
from
yellow
to
green
is
not
like
that
which
goes
from
green
to
blue
they
are
different
movements
that
which
goes
from
flower
to
fruit
is
not
like
that
which
goes
from
larva
to
nymph
and
from
nymph
to
perfect
insect
they
are
different
movements
the
action
of
eating
or
of
drinking
is
not
like
the
action
of
fighting
they
are
different
movements
and
these
three
kinds
of
movement
themselves
qualitative
evolutionary
extensive
differ
profoundly
the
trick
of
our
perception
like
that
of
our
intelligence
like
that
of
our
language
consists
in
extracting
from
these
profoundly
different
becomings
the
single
representation
of
becoming
undefined
becoming
a
mere
abstraction
which
by
itself
says
nothing
and
of
which
indeed
it
is
very
rarely
that
we
think
to
this
idea
always
the
same
and
always
obscure
or
unconscious
we
then
join
in
each
particular
case
one
or
several
clear
images
that
represent
and
which
serve
to
distinguish
all
becomings
from
each
other
it
is
this
composition
of
a
specified
and
definite
state
with
change
general
and
undefined
that
we
substitute
for
the
specific
change
an
infinite
multiplicity
of
becomings
variously
colored
so
to
speak
passes
before
our
eyes
we
manage
so
that
we
see
only
differences
of
color
that
is
to
say
differences
of
state
beneath
which
there
is
supposed
to
flow
hidden
from
our
view
a
becoming
always
and
everywhere
the
same
invariably
colorless
suppose
we
wish
to
portray
on
a
screen
a
living
picture
such
as
the
marching
past
of
a
regiment
there
is
one
way
in
which
it
might
first
occur
to
us
to
do
it
that
would
be
to
cut
out
jointed
figures
representing
the
soldiers
to
give
to
each
of
them
the
movement
of
marching
a
movement
varying
from
individual
to
individual
although
common
to
the
human
species
and
to
throw
the
whole
on
the
screen
we
should
need
to
spend
on
this
little
game
an
enormous
amount
of
work
and
even
then
we
should
obtain
but
a
very
poor
result
how
could
it
at
its
best
reproduce
the
suppleness
and
variety
of
life
now
there
is
another
way
of
proceeding
more
easy
and
at
the
same
time
more
effective
it
is
to
take
a
series
of
snapshots
of
the
passing
regiment
and
to
throw
these
instantaneous
views
on
the
screen
so
that
they
replace
each
other
very
rapidly
this
is
what
the
cinematograph
does
with
photographs
each
of
which
represents
the
regiment
in
a
fixed
attitude
it
reconstitutes
the
mobility
of
the
regiment
marching
it
is
true
that
if
we
had
to
do
with
photographs
alone
however
much
we
might
look
at
them
we
should
never
see
them
animated
with
immobility
set
beside
immobility
even
endlessly
we
could
never
make
movement
in
order
that
the
pictures
may
be
animated
there
must
be
movement
somewhere
the
movement
does
indeed
exist
here
it
is
in
the
apparatus
it
is
because
the
film
of
the
cinematograph
unrolls
bringing
in
turn
the
different
photographs
of
the
scene
to
continue
each
other
that
each
actor
of
the
scene
recovers
his
mobility
he
strings
all
his
successive
attitudes
on
the
invisible
movement
of
the
film
the
process
then
consists
in
extracting
from
all
the
movements
peculiar
to
all
the
figures
an
impersonal
movement
abstract
and
simple
in
so
to
speak
we
put
this
into
the
apparatus
and
we
reconstitute
the
individuality
of
each
particular
movement
by
combining
this
nameless
movement
with
the
personal
attitudes
such
is
the
contrivance
of
the
cinematograph
and
such
is
also
that
of
our
knowledge
instead
of
attaching
ourselves
to
the
inner
becoming
of
things
we
place
ourselves
outside
them
in
order
to
recompose
their
becoming
artificially
we
take
snapshots
as
it
were
of
the
passing
reality
and
as
these
are
characteristic
of
the
reality
we
have
only
to
string
them
on
a
becoming
abstract
uniform
and
invisible
situated
at
the
back
of
the
apparatus
of
knowledge
in
order
to
imitate
what
there
is
that
is
characteristic
in
this
becoming
itself
perception
intellection
language
so
proceed
in
general
whether
we
would
think
becoming
or
express
it
or
even
perceive
it
we
hardly
do
anything
else
than
set
going
a
kind
of
cinematograph
inside
us
we
may
therefore
sum
up
what
we
have
been
saying
in
the
conclusion
that
the
of
our
ordinary
knowledge
is
of
a
cinematographical
of
the
altogether
practical
character
of
this
operation
there
is
no
possible
doubt
each
of
our
acts
aims
at
a
certain
insertion
of
our
will
into
the
reality
there
is
between
our
body
and
other
bodies
an
arrangement
like
that
of
the
pieces
of
glass
that
compose
a
kaleidoscopic
picture
our
activity
goes
from
an
arrangement
to
a
rearrangement
each
time
no
doubt
giving
the
kaleidoscope
a
new
shake
but
not
interesting
itself
in
the
shake
and
seeing
only
the
new
picture
our
knowledge
of
the
operation
of
nature
must
be
exactly
symmetrical
therefore
with
the
interest
we
take
in
our
own
operation
in
this
sense
we
may
say
if
we
are
not
abusing
this
kind
of
illustration
that
cinematographical
character
of
our
knowledge
of
things
is
due
to
the
kaleidoscopic
character
of
our
adaptation
to
the
cinematographical
method
is
therefore
the
only
practical
method
since
it
consists
in
making
the
general
character
of
knowledge
form
itself
on
that
of
action
while
expecting
that
the
detail
of
each
act
should
depend
in
its
turn
on
that
of
knowledge
in
order
that
action
may
always
be
enlightened
intelligence
must
always
be
present
in
it
but
intelligence
in
order
thus
to
accompany
the
progress
of
activity
and
ensure
its
direction
must
begin
by
adopting
its
rhythm
action
is
discontinuous
like
every
pulsation
of
life
discontinuous
therefore
is
knowledge
the
mechanism
of
the
faculty
of
knowing
has
been
constructed
on
this
plan
essentially
practical
can
it
be
of
use
such
as
it
is
for
speculation
let
us
try
with
it
to
follow
reality
in
its
windings
and
see
what
will
happen
i
take
of
the
continuity
of
a
particular
becoming
a
series
of
views
which
i
connect
together
by
becoming
in
general
but
of
course
i
can
not
stop
there
what
is
not
determinable
is
not
representable
of
becoming
in
general
i
have
only
a
verbal
knowledge
as
the
letter
designates
a
certain
unknown
quantity
whatever
it
may
be
so
my
becoming
in
general
always
the
same
symbolizes
here
a
certain
transition
of
which
i
have
taken
some
snapshots
of
the
transition
itself
it
teaches
me
nothing
let
me
then
concentrate
myself
wholly
on
the
transition
and
between
any
two
snapshots
endeavor
to
realize
what
is
going
on
as
i
apply
the
same
method
i
obtain
the
same
result
a
third
view
merely
slips
in
between
the
two
others
i
may
begin
again
as
often
as
i
will
i
may
set
views
alongside
of
views
for
ever
i
shall
obtain
nothing
else
the
application
of
the
cinematographical
method
therefore
leads
to
a
perpetual
recommencement
during
which
the
mind
never
able
to
satisfy
itself
and
never
finding
where
to
rest
persuades
itself
no
doubt
that
it
imitates
by
its
instability
the
very
movement
of
the
real
but
though
by
straining
itself
to
the
point
of
giddiness
it
may
end
by
giving
itself
the
illusion
of
mobility
its
operation
has
not
advanced
it
a
step
since
it
remains
as
far
as
ever
from
its
goal
in
order
to
advance
with
the
moving
reality
you
must
replace
yourself
within
it
install
yourself
within
change
and
you
will
grasp
at
once
both
change
itself
and
the
successive
states
in
which
at
any
instant
be
immobilized
but
with
these
successive
states
perceived
from
without
as
real
and
no
longer
as
potential
immobilities
you
will
never
reconstitute
movement
call
them
or
as
the
case
may
be
multiply
the
number
of
them
as
you
will
let
the
interval
between
two
consecutive
states
be
infinitely
small
before
the
intervening
movement
you
will
always
experience
the
disappointment
of
the
child
who
tries
by
clapping
his
hands
together
to
crush
the
smoke
the
movement
slips
through
the
interval
because
every
attempt
to
reconstitute
change
out
of
states
implies
the
absurd
proposition
that
movement
is
made
of
immobilities
philosophy
perceived
this
as
soon
as
it
opened
its
eyes
the
arguments
of
zeno
of
elea
although
formulated
with
a
very
different
intention
have
no
other
meaning
take
the
flying
arrow
at
every
moment
says
zeno
it
is
motionless
for
it
can
not
have
time
to
move
that
is
to
occupy
at
least
two
successive
positions
unless
at
least
two
moments
are
allowed
it
at
a
given
moment
therefore
it
is
at
rest
at
a
given
point
motionless
in
each
point
of
its
course
it
is
motionless
during
all
the
time
that
it
is
moving
yes
if
we
suppose
that
the
arrow
can
ever
in
a
point
of
its
course
yes
again
if
the
arrow
which
is
moving
ever
coincides
with
a
position
which
is
motionless
but
the
arrow
never
in
any
point
of
its
course
the
most
we
can
say
is
that
it
might
be
there
in
this
sense
that
it
passes
there
and
might
stop
there
it
is
true
that
if
it
did
stop
there
it
would
be
at
rest
there
and
at
this
point
it
is
no
longer
movement
that
we
should
have
to
do
with
the
truth
is
that
if
the
arrow
leaves
the
point
a
to
fall
down
at
the
point
b
its
movement
ab
is
as
simple
as
indecomposable
in
so
far
as
it
is
movement
as
the
tension
of
the
bow
that
shoots
it
as
the
shrapnel
bursting
before
it
falls
to
the
ground
covers
the
explosive
zone
with
an
indivisible
danger
so
the
arrow
which
goes
from
a
to
b
displays
with
a
single
stroke
although
over
a
certain
extent
of
duration
its
indivisible
mobility
suppose
an
elastic
stretched
from
a
to
b
could
you
divide
its
extension
the
course
of
the
arrow
is
this
very
extension
it
is
equally
simple
and
equally
undivided
it
is
a
single
and
unique
bound
you
fix
a
point
c
in
the
interval
passed
and
say
that
at
a
certain
moment
the
arrow
was
in
if
it
had
been
there
it
would
have
been
stopped
there
and
you
would
no
longer
have
had
a
flight
from
a
to
b
but
flights
one
from
a
to
c
and
the
other
from
c
to
b
with
an
interval
of
rest
a
single
movement
is
entirely
by
the
hypothesis
a
movement
between
two
stops
if
there
are
intermediate
stops
it
is
no
longer
a
single
movement
at
bottom
the
illusion
arises
from
this
that
the
movement
has
laid
along
its
course
a
motionless
trajectory
on
which
we
can
count
as
many
immobilities
as
we
will
from
this
we
conclude
that
the
movement
being
lays
at
each
instant
beneath
it
a
position
with
which
it
coincides
we
do
not
see
that
the
trajectory
is
created
in
one
stroke
although
a
certain
time
is
required
for
it
and
that
though
we
can
divide
at
will
the
trajectory
once
created
we
can
not
divide
its
creation
which
is
an
act
in
progress
and
not
a
thing
to
suppose
that
the
moving
body
at
a
point
of
its
course
is
to
cut
the
course
in
two
by
a
snip
of
the
scissors
at
this
point
and
to
substitute
two
trajectories
for
the
single
trajectory
which
we
were
first
considering
it
is
to
distinguish
two
successive
acts
where
by
the
hypothesis
there
is
only
one
in
short
it
is
to
attribute
to
the
course
itself
of
the
arrow
everything
that
can
be
said
of
the
interval
that
the
arrow
has
traversed
that
is
to
say
to
admit
the
absurdity
that
movement
coincides
with
immobility
we
shall
not
dwell
here
on
the
three
other
arguments
of
zeno
we
have
examined
them
elsewhere
it
is
enough
to
point
out
that
they
all
consist
in
applying
the
movement
to
the
line
traversed
and
supposing
that
what
is
true
of
the
line
is
true
of
the
movement
the
line
for
example
may
be
divided
into
as
many
parts
as
we
wish
of
any
length
that
we
wish
and
it
is
always
the
same
line
from
this
we
conclude
that
we
have
the
right
to
suppose
the
movement
articulated
as
we
wish
and
that
it
is
always
the
same
movement
we
thus
obtain
a
series
of
absurdities
that
all
express
the
same
fundamental
absurdity
but
the
possibility
of
applying
the
movement
the
line
traversed
exists
only
for
an
observer
who
keeping
outside
the
movement
and
seeing
at
every
instant
the
possibility
of
a
stop
tries
to
reconstruct
the
real
movement
with
these
possible
immobilities
the
absurdity
vanishes
as
soon
as
we
adopt
by
thought
the
continuity
of
the
real
movement
a
continuity
of
which
every
one
of
us
is
conscious
whenever
he
lifts
an
arm
or
advances
a
step
we
feel
then
indeed
that
the
line
passed
over
between
two
stops
is
described
with
a
single
indivisible
stroke
and
that
we
seek
in
vain
to
practice
on
the
movement
which
traces
the
line
divisions
corresponding
each
to
each
with
the
divisions
arbitrarily
chosen
of
the
line
once
it
has
been
traced
the
line
traversed
by
the
moving
body
lends
itself
to
any
kind
of
division
because
it
has
no
internal
organization
but
all
movement
is
articulated
inwardly
it
is
either
an
indivisible
bound
which
may
occupy
nevertheless
a
very
long
duration
or
a
series
of
indivisible
bounds
take
the
articulations
of
this
movement
into
account
or
give
up
speculating
on
its
nature
when
achilles
pursues
the
tortoise
each
of
his
steps
must
be
treated
as
indivisible
and
so
must
each
step
of
the
tortoise
after
a
certain
number
of
steps
achilles
will
have
overtaken
the
tortoise
there
is
nothing
more
simple
if
you
insist
on
dividing
the
two
motions
further
distinguish
both
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
in
the
course
of
achilles
and
in
that
of
the
tortoise
the
of
the
steps
of
each
of
them
but
respect
the
natural
articulations
of
the
two
courses
as
long
as
you
respect
them
no
difficulty
will
arise
because
you
will
follow
the
indications
of
experience
but
zeno
device
is
to
reconstruct
the
movement
of
achilles
according
to
a
law
arbitrarily
chosen
achilles
with
a
first
step
is
supposed
to
arrive
at
the
point
where
the
tortoise
was
with
a
second
step
at
the
point
which
it
has
moved
to
while
he
was
making
the
first
and
so
on
in
this
case
achilles
would
always
have
a
new
step
to
take
but
obviously
to
overtake
the
tortoise
he
goes
about
it
in
quite
another
way
the
movement
considered
by
zeno
would
only
be
the
equivalent
of
the
movement
of
achilles
if
we
could
treat
the
movement
as
we
treat
the
interval
passed
through
decomposable
and
recomposable
at
will
once
you
subscribe
to
this
first
absurdity
all
the
others
follow
nothing
would
be
easier
now
than
to
extend
zeno
argument
to
qualitative
becoming
and
to
evolutionary
becoming
we
should
find
the
same
contradictions
in
these
that
the
child
can
become
a
youth
ripen
to
maturity
and
decline
to
old
age
we
understand
when
we
consider
that
vital
evolution
is
here
the
reality
itself
infancy
adolescence
maturity
old
age
are
mere
views
of
the
mind
imagined
by
us
from
without
along
the
continuity
of
a
progress
on
the
contrary
let
childhood
adolescence
maturity
and
old
age
be
given
as
integral
parts
of
the
evolution
they
become
and
we
can
no
longer
conceive
how
evolution
is
possible
for
rests
placed
beside
rests
will
never
be
equivalent
to
a
movement
how
with
what
is
made
can
we
reconstitute
what
is
being
made
how
for
instance
from
childhood
once
posited
as
a
shall
we
pass
to
adolescence
when
by
the
hypothesis
childhood
only
is
given
if
we
look
at
it
closely
we
shall
see
that
our
habitual
manner
of
speaking
which
is
fashioned
after
our
habitual
manner
of
thinking
leads
us
to
actual
logical
to
which
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
led
without
anxiety
because
we
feel
confusedly
that
we
can
always
get
out
of
them
if
we
like
all
that
we
have
to
do
in
fact
is
to
give
up
the
cinematographical
habits
of
our
intellect
when
we
say
the
child
becomes
a
man
let
us
take
care
not
to
fathom
too
deeply
the
literal
meaning
of
the
expression
or
we
shall
find
that
when
we
posit
the
subject
child
the
attribute
man
does
not
yet
apply
to
it
and
that
when
we
express
the
attribute
man
it
applies
no
more
to
the
subject
child
the
reality
which
is
the
from
childhood
to
manhood
has
slipped
between
our
fingers
we
have
only
the
imaginary
stops
child
and
man
and
we
are
very
near
to
saying
that
one
of
these
stops
the
other
just
as
the
arrow
of
zeno
according
to
that
philosopher
at
all
the
points
of
the
course
the
truth
is
that
if
language
here
were
molded
on
reality
we
should
not
say
the
child
becomes
the
man
but
there
is
becoming
from
the
child
to
the
man
in
the
first
proposition
becomes
is
a
verb
of
indeterminate
meaning
intended
to
mask
the
absurdity
into
which
we
fall
when
we
attribute
the
state
man
to
the
subject
child
it
behaves
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
movement
always
the
same
of
the
cinematographical
film
a
movement
hidden
in
the
apparatus
and
whose
function
it
is
to
superpose
the
successive
pictures
on
one
another
in
order
to
imitate
the
movement
of
the
real
object
in
the
second
proposition
becoming
is
a
subject
it
comes
to
the
front
it
is
the
reality
itself
childhood
and
manhood
are
then
only
possible
stops
mere
views
of
the
mind
we
now
have
to
do
with
the
objective
movement
itself
and
no
longer
with
its
cinematographical
imitation
but
the
first
manner
of
expression
is
alone
conformable
to
our
habits
of
language
we
must
in
order
to
adopt
the
second
escape
from
the
cinematographical
mechanism
of
thought
we
must
make
complete
abstraction
of
this
mechanism
if
we
wish
to
get
rid
at
one
stroke
of
the
theoretical
absurdities
that
the
question
of
movement
raises
all
is
obscure
all
is
contradictory
when
we
try
with
states
to
build
up
a
transition
the
obscurity
is
cleared
up
the
contradiction
vanishes
as
soon
as
we
place
ourselves
along
the
transition
in
order
to
distinguish
states
in
it
by
making
cross
cuts
therein
in
thought
the
reason
is
that
there
is
in
the
transition
than
the
series
of
states
that
is
to
say
the
possible
cuts
in
the
movement
than
the
series
of
positions
that
is
to
say
the
possible
stops
only
the
first
way
of
looking
at
things
is
conformable
to
the
processes
of
the
human
mind
the
second
requires
on
the
contrary
that
we
reverse
the
bent
of
our
intellectual
habits
no
wonder
then
if
philosophy
at
first
recoiled
before
such
an
effort
the
greeks
trusted
to
nature
trusted
the
natural
propensity
of
the
mind
trusted
language
above
all
in
so
far
as
it
naturally
externalizes
thought
rather
than
lay
blame
on
the
attitude
of
thought
and
language
toward
the
course
of
things
they
preferred
to
pronounce
the
course
of
things
itself
to
be
wrong
such
indeed
was
the
sentence
passed
by
the
philosophers
of
the
eleatic
school
and
they
passed
it
without
any
reservation
whatever
as
becoming
shocks
the
habits
of
thought
and
fits
ill
into
the
molds
of
language
they
declared
it
unreal
in
spatial
movement
and
in
change
in
general
they
saw
only
pure
illusion
this
conclusion
could
be
softened
down
without
changing
the
premisses
by
saying
that
the
reality
changes
but
that
it
to
change
experience
confronts
us
with
becoming
that
is
reality
but
the
reality
that
which
to
be
is
more
real
still
and
that
reality
does
not
change
beneath
the
qualitative
becoming
beneath
the
evolutionary
becoming
beneath
the
extensive
becoming
the
mind
must
seek
that
which
defies
change
the
definable
quality
the
form
or
essence
the
end
such
was
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
philosophy
which
developed
throughout
the
classic
age
the
philosophy
of
forms
or
to
use
a
term
more
akin
to
the
greek
the
philosophy
of
ideas
the
word
greek
eidos
which
we
translate
here
by
idea
has
in
fact
this
threefold
meaning
it
denotes
the
quality
the
form
or
essence
the
end
or
in
the
sense
of
of
the
act
being
performed
that
is
to
say
at
bottom
the
in
the
sense
of
of
the
act
supposed
accomplished
three
aspects
are
those
of
the
adjective
substantive
and
verb
and
correspond
to
the
three
essential
categories
of
after
the
explanations
we
have
given
above
we
might
and
perhaps
we
ought
to
translate
greek
eidos
by
view
or
rather
by
moment
for
greek
eidos
is
the
stable
view
taken
of
the
instability
of
things
the
which
is
a
moment
of
becoming
the
which
is
a
moment
of
evolution
the
which
is
the
mean
form
above
and
below
which
the
other
forms
are
arranged
as
alterations
of
the
mean
finally
the
intention
or
which
presides
over
the
action
being
accomplished
and
which
is
nothing
else
we
said
than
the
traced
out
and
contemplated
beforehand
of
the
action
accomplished
to
reduce
things
to
ideas
is
therefore
to
resolve
becoming
into
its
principal
moments
each
of
these
being
moreover
by
the
hypothesis
screened
from
the
laws
of
time
and
as
it
were
plucked
out
of
eternity
that
is
to
say
that
we
end
in
the
philosophy
of
ideas
when
we
apply
the
cinematographical
mechanism
of
the
intellect
to
the
analysis
of
the
real
but
when
we
put
immutable
ideas
at
the
base
of
the
moving
reality
a
whole
physics
a
whole
cosmology
a
whole
theology
follows
necessarily
we
must
insist
on
the
point
not
that
we
mean
to
summarize
in
a
few
pages
a
philosophy
so
complex
and
so
comprehensive
as
that
of
the
greeks
but
since
we
have
described
the
cinematographical
mechanism
of
the
intellect
it
is
important
that
we
should
show
to
what
idea
of
reality
the
play
of
this
mechanism
leads
it
is
the
very
idea
we
believe
that
we
find
in
the
ancient
philosophy
the
main
lines
of
the
doctrine
that
was
developed
from
plato
to
plotinus
passing
through
aristotle
and
even
in
a
certain
measure
through
the
stoics
have
nothing
accidental
nothing
contingent
nothing
that
must
be
regarded
as
a
philosopher
fancy
they
indicate
the
vision
that
a
systematic
intellect
obtains
of
the
universal
becoming
when
regarding
it
by
means
of
snapshots
taken
at
intervals
of
its
flowing
so
that
even
we
shall
philosophize
in
the
manner
of
the
greeks
we
shall
rediscover
without
needing
to
know
them
such
and
such
of
their
general
conclusions
in
the
exact
proportion
that
we
trust
in
the
cinematographical
instinct
of
our
thought
we
said
there
is
in
a
movement
than
in
the
successive
positions
attributed
to
the
moving
object
in
a
becoming
than
in
the
forms
passed
through
in
turn
in
the
evolution
of
form
than
the
forms
assumed
one
after
another
philosophy
can
therefore
derive
terms
of
the
second
kind
from
those
of
the
first
but
not
the
first
from
the
second
from
the
first
terms
speculation
must
take
its
start
but
the
intellect
reverses
the
order
of
the
two
groups
and
on
this
point
ancient
philosophy
proceeds
as
the
intellect
does
it
installs
itself
in
the
immutable
it
posits
only
ideas
yet
becoming
exists
it
is
a
fact
how
then
having
posited
immutability
alone
shall
we
make
change
come
forth
from
it
not
by
the
addition
of
anything
for
by
the
hypothesis
there
exists
nothing
positive
outside
ideas
it
must
therefore
be
by
a
diminution
so
at
the
base
of
ancient
philosophy
lies
necessarily
this
postulate
that
there
is
more
in
the
motionless
than
in
the
moving
and
that
we
pass
from
immutability
to
becoming
by
way
of
diminution
or
attenuation
it
is
therefore
something
negative
or
zero
at
most
that
must
be
added
to
ideas
to
obtain
change
in
that
consists
the
platonic
the
aristotelian
matter
a
metaphysical
zero
which
joined
to
the
idea
like
the
arithmetical
zero
to
unity
multiplies
it
in
space
and
time
by
it
the
motionless
and
simple
idea
is
refracted
into
a
movement
spread
out
indefinitely
in
right
there
ought
to
be
nothing
but
immutable
ideas
immutably
fitted
to
each
other
in
fact
matter
comes
to
add
to
them
its
void
and
thereby
lets
loose
the
universal
becoming
it
is
an
elusive
nothing
that
creeps
between
the
ideas
and
creates
endless
agitation
eternal
disquiet
like
a
suspicion
insinuated
between
two
loving
hearts
degrade
the
immutable
ideas
you
obtain
by
that
alone
the
perpetual
flux
of
things
the
ideas
or
forms
are
the
whole
of
intelligible
reality
that
is
to
say
of
truth
in
that
they
represent
all
together
the
theoretical
equilibrium
of
being
as
to
sensible
reality
it
is
a
perpetual
oscillation
from
one
side
to
the
other
of
this
point
of
equilibrium
hence
throughout
the
whole
philosophy
of
ideas
there
is
a
certain
conception
of
duration
as
also
of
the
relation
of
time
to
eternity
he
who
installs
himself
in
becoming
sees
in
duration
the
very
life
of
things
the
fundamental
reality
the
forms
which
the
mind
isolates
and
stores
up
in
concepts
are
then
only
snapshots
of
the
changing
reality
they
are
moments
gathered
along
the
course
of
time
and
just
because
we
have
cut
the
thread
that
binds
them
to
time
they
no
longer
endure
they
tend
to
withdraw
into
their
own
definition
that
is
to
say
into
the
artificial
reconstruction
and
symbolical
expression
which
is
their
intellectual
equivalent
they
enter
into
eternity
if
you
will
but
what
is
eternal
in
them
is
just
what
is
unreal
on
the
contrary
if
we
treat
becoming
by
the
cinematographical
method
the
forms
are
no
longer
snapshots
taken
of
the
change
they
are
its
constitutive
elements
they
represent
all
that
is
positive
in
becoming
eternity
no
longer
hovers
over
time
as
an
abstraction
it
underlies
time
as
a
reality
such
is
exactly
on
this
point
the
attitude
of
the
philosophy
of
forms
or
ideas
it
establishes
between
eternity
and
time
the
same
relation
as
between
a
piece
of
gold
and
the
small
change
change
so
small
that
payment
goes
on
for
ever
without
the
debt
being
paid
off
the
debt
could
be
paid
at
once
with
the
piece
of
gold
it
is
this
that
plato
expresses
in
his
magnificent
language
when
he
says
that
god
unable
to
make
the
world
eternal
gave
it
time
a
moving
image
of
eternity
hence
also
arises
a
certain
conception
of
extension
which
is
at
the
base
of
the
philosophy
of
ideas
although
it
has
not
been
so
explicitly
brought
out
let
us
imagine
a
mind
placed
alongside
becoming
and
adopting
its
movement
each
successive
state
each
quality
each
form
in
short
will
be
seen
by
it
as
a
mere
cut
made
by
thought
in
the
universal
becoming
it
will
be
found
that
form
is
essentially
extended
inseparable
as
it
is
from
the
extensity
of
the
becoming
which
has
materialized
it
in
the
course
of
its
flow
every
form
thus
occupies
space
as
it
occupies
time
but
the
philosophy
of
ideas
follows
the
inverse
direction
it
starts
from
the
form
it
sees
in
the
form
the
very
essence
of
reality
it
does
not
take
form
as
a
snapshot
of
becoming
it
posits
forms
in
the
eternal
of
this
motionless
eternity
then
duration
and
becoming
are
supposed
to
be
only
the
degradation
form
thus
posited
independent
of
time
is
then
no
longer
what
is
found
in
a
perception
it
is
a
and
as
a
reality
of
the
conceptual
order
occupies
no
more
of
extension
than
it
does
of
duration
the
forms
must
be
stationed
outside
space
as
well
as
above
time
space
and
time
have
therefore
necessarily
in
ancient
philosophy
the
same
origin
and
the
same
value
the
same
diminution
of
being
is
expressed
both
by
extension
in
space
and
detention
in
time
both
of
these
are
but
the
distance
between
what
is
and
what
ought
to
be
from
the
standpoint
of
ancient
philosophy
space
and
time
can
be
nothing
but
the
field
that
an
incomplete
reality
or
rather
a
reality
that
has
gone
astray
from
itself
needs
in
order
to
run
in
quest
of
itself
only
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
field
is
created
as
the
hunting
progresses
and
that
the
hunting
in
some
way
deposits
the
field
beneath
it
move
an
imaginary
pendulum
a
mere
mathematical
point
from
its
position
of
equilibrium
a
perpetual
oscillation
is
started
along
which
points
are
placed
next
to
points
and
moments
succeed
moments
the
space
and
time
which
thus
arise
have
no
more
positivity
than
the
movement
itself
they
represent
the
remoteness
of
the
position
artificially
given
to
the
pendulum
from
its
normal
position
it
in
order
to
regain
its
natural
stability
bring
it
back
to
its
normal
position
space
time
and
motion
shrink
to
a
mathematical
point
just
so
human
reasonings
are
drawn
out
into
an
endless
chain
but
are
at
once
swallowed
up
in
the
truth
seized
by
intuition
for
their
extension
in
space
and
time
is
only
the
distance
so
to
speak
between
thought
and
truth
so
of
extension
and
duration
in
relation
to
pure
forms
or
ideas
the
sensible
forms
are
before
us
ever
about
to
recover
their
ideality
ever
prevented
by
the
matter
they
bear
in
them
that
is
to
say
by
their
inner
void
by
the
interval
between
what
they
are
and
what
they
ought
to
be
they
are
for
ever
on
the
point
of
recovering
themselves
for
ever
occupied
in
losing
themselves
an
inflexible
law
condemns
them
like
the
rock
of
sisyphus
to
fall
back
when
they
are
almost
touching
the
summit
and
this
law
which
has
projected
them
into
space
and
time
is
nothing
other
than
the
very
constancy
of
their
original
insufficiency
the
alternations
of
generation
and
decay
the
evolutions
ever
beginning
over
and
over
again
the
infinite
repetition
of
the
cycles
of
celestial
spheres
this
all
represents
merely
a
certain
fundamental
deficit
in
which
materiality
consists
fill
up
this
deficit
at
once
you
suppress
space
and
time
that
is
to
say
the
endlessly
renewed
oscillations
around
a
stable
equilibrium
always
aimed
at
never
reached
things
into
each
other
what
was
extended
in
space
is
contracted
into
pure
form
and
past
present
and
future
shrink
into
a
single
moment
which
is
eternity
this
amounts
to
saying
that
physics
is
but
logic
spoiled
in
this
proposition
the
whole
philosophy
of
ideas
is
summarized
and
in
it
also
is
the
hidden
principle
of
the
philosophy
that
is
innate
in
our
understanding
if
immutability
is
more
than
becoming
form
is
more
than
change
and
it
is
by
a
veritable
fall
that
the
logical
system
of
ideas
rationally
subordinated
and
coördinated
among
themselves
is
scattered
into
a
physical
series
of
objects
and
events
accidentally
placed
one
after
another
the
generative
idea
of
a
poem
is
developed
in
thousands
of
imaginations
which
are
materialized
in
phrases
that
spread
themselves
out
in
words
and
the
more
we
descend
from
the
motionless
idea
wound
on
itself
to
the
words
that
unwind
it
the
more
room
is
left
for
contingency
and
choice
other
metaphors
expressed
by
other
words
might
have
arisen
an
image
is
called
up
by
an
image
a
word
by
a
word
all
these
words
run
now
one
after
another
seeking
in
vain
by
themselves
to
give
back
the
simplicity
of
the
generative
idea
our
ear
only
hears
the
words
it
therefore
perceives
only
accidents
but
our
mind
by
successive
bounds
leaps
from
the
words
to
the
images
from
the
images
to
the
original
idea
and
so
gets
back
from
the
perception
of
words
accidents
called
up
by
accidents
to
the
conception
of
the
idea
that
posits
its
own
being
so
the
philosopher
proceeds
confronted
with
the
universe
experience
makes
to
pass
before
his
eyes
phenomena
which
run
they
also
one
behind
another
in
an
accidental
order
determined
by
circumstances
of
time
and
place
this
physical
order
a
degeneration
of
the
logical
order
is
nothing
else
but
the
fall
of
the
logical
into
space
and
time
but
the
philosopher
ascending
again
from
the
percept
to
the
concept
sees
condensed
into
the
logical
all
the
positive
reality
that
the
physical
possesses
his
intellect
doing
away
with
the
materiality
that
lessens
being
grasps
being
itself
in
the
immutable
system
of
ideas
thus
science
is
obtained
which
appears
to
us
complete
and
as
soon
as
we
put
back
our
intellect
into
its
true
place
correcting
the
deviation
that
separated
it
from
the
intelligible
science
is
not
then
a
human
construction
it
is
prior
to
our
intellect
independent
of
it
veritably
the
generator
of
things
and
indeed
if
we
hold
the
forms
to
be
simply
snapshots
taken
by
the
mind
of
the
continuity
of
becoming
they
must
be
relative
to
the
mind
that
thinks
them
they
can
have
no
independent
existence
at
most
we
might
say
that
each
of
these
ideas
is
an
but
it
is
in
the
opposite
hypothesis
that
we
are
placing
ourselves
ideas
must
then
exist
by
themselves
ancient
philosophy
could
not
escape
this
conclusion
plato
formulated
it
and
in
vain
did
aristotle
strive
to
avoid
it
since
movement
arises
from
the
degradation
of
the
immutable
there
could
be
no
movement
consequently
no
sensible
world
if
there
were
not
somewhere
immutability
realized
so
having
begun
by
refusing
to
ideas
an
independent
existence
and
finding
himself
nevertheless
unable
to
deprive
them
of
it
aristotle
pressed
them
into
each
other
rolled
them
up
into
a
ball
and
set
above
the
physical
world
a
form
that
was
thus
found
to
be
the
form
of
forms
the
idea
of
ideas
or
to
use
his
own
words
the
thought
of
thought
such
is
the
god
of
aristotle
necessarily
immutable
and
apart
from
what
is
happening
in
the
world
since
he
is
only
the
synthesis
of
all
concepts
in
a
single
concept
it
is
true
that
no
one
of
the
manifold
concepts
could
exist
apart
such
as
it
is
in
the
divine
unity
in
vain
should
we
look
for
the
ideas
of
plato
within
the
god
of
aristotle
but
if
only
we
imagine
the
god
of
aristotle
in
a
sort
of
refraction
of
himself
or
simply
inclining
toward
the
world
at
once
the
platonic
ideas
are
seen
to
pour
themselves
out
of
him
as
if
they
were
involved
in
the
unity
of
his
essence
so
rays
stream
out
from
the
sun
which
nevertheless
did
not
contain
them
it
is
probably
this
of
an
of
platonic
ideas
from
the
aristotelian
god
that
is
meant
in
the
philosophy
of
aristotle
by
the
active
intellect
the
greek
nous
that
has
been
called
greek
poiêtikos
that
is
by
what
is
essential
and
yet
unconscious
in
human
intelligence
the
greek
nous
poiêtikos
is
science
entire
posited
all
at
once
which
the
conscious
discursive
intellect
is
condemned
to
reconstruct
with
difficulty
bit
by
bit
there
is
then
within
us
or
rather
behind
us
a
possible
vision
of
god
as
the
alexandrians
said
a
vision
always
virtual
never
actually
realized
by
the
conscious
intellect
in
this
intuition
we
should
see
god
expand
in
ideas
this
it
is
that
does
everything
playing
in
relation
to
the
discursive
intellect
which
moves
in
time
the
same
rôle
as
the
motionless
mover
himself
plays
in
relation
to
the
movement
of
the
heavens
and
the
course
of
things
there
is
then
immanent
in
the
philosophy
of
ideas
a
particular
conception
of
causality
which
it
is
important
to
bring
into
full
light
because
it
is
that
which
each
of
us
will
reach
when
in
order
to
ascend
to
the
origin
of
things
he
follows
to
the
end
the
natural
movement
of
the
intellect
true
the
ancient
philosophers
never
formulated
it
explicitly
they
confined
themselves
to
drawing
the
consequences
of
it
and
in
general
they
have
marked
but
points
of
view
of
it
rather
than
presented
it
itself
sometimes
indeed
they
speak
of
an
sometimes
of
an
exercised
by
the
prime
mover
on
the
whole
of
the
world
both
views
are
found
in
aristotle
who
shows
us
in
the
movement
of
the
universe
an
aspiration
of
things
toward
the
divine
perfection
and
consequently
an
ascent
toward
god
while
he
describes
it
elsewhere
as
the
effect
of
a
contact
of
god
with
the
first
sphere
and
as
descending
consequently
from
god
to
things
the
alexandrians
we
think
do
no
more
than
follow
this
double
indication
when
they
speak
of
and
everything
is
derived
from
the
first
principle
and
everything
aspires
to
return
to
it
but
these
two
conceptions
of
the
divine
causality
can
only
be
identified
together
if
we
bring
them
both
the
one
and
the
other
back
to
a
third
which
we
hold
to
be
fundamental
and
which
alone
will
enable
us
to
understand
not
only
why
in
what
sense
things
move
in
space
and
time
but
also
why
there
is
space
and
time
why
there
is
movement
why
there
are
things
this
conception
which
more
and
more
shows
through
the
reasonings
of
the
greek
philosophers
as
we
go
from
plato
to
plotinus
we
may
formulate
thus
affirmation
of
a
reality
implies
the
simultaneous
affirmation
of
all
the
degrees
of
reality
intermediate
between
it
and
the
principle
is
evident
in
the
case
of
number
we
can
not
affirm
the
number
without
thereby
affirming
the
existence
of
the
numbers
in
short
of
the
whole
interval
between
and
zero
but
here
our
mind
passes
naturally
from
the
sphere
of
quantity
to
that
of
quality
it
seems
to
us
that
a
certain
perfection
being
given
the
whole
continuity
of
degradations
is
given
also
between
this
perfection
on
the
one
hand
and
the
nought
on
the
other
hand
that
we
think
we
conceive
let
us
then
posit
the
god
of
aristotle
thought
of
thought
that
is
thought
a
transforming
itself
from
subject
to
object
and
from
object
to
subject
by
an
instantaneous
or
rather
an
eternal
circular
process
as
on
the
other
hand
the
nought
appears
to
posit
itself
and
as
the
two
extremities
being
given
the
interval
between
them
is
equally
given
it
follows
that
all
the
descending
degrees
of
being
from
the
divine
perfection
down
to
the
absolute
nothing
are
realized
automatically
so
to
speak
when
we
have
posited
god
let
us
then
run
through
this
interval
from
top
to
bottom
first
of
all
the
slightest
diminution
of
the
first
principle
will
be
enough
to
precipitate
being
into
space
and
time
but
duration
and
extension
which
represent
this
first
diminution
will
be
as
near
as
possible
to
the
divine
inextension
and
eternity
we
must
therefore
picture
to
ourselves
this
first
degradation
of
the
divine
principle
as
a
sphere
turning
on
itself
imitating
by
the
perpetuity
of
its
circular
movement
the
eternity
of
the
circle
of
the
divine
thought
creating
moreover
its
own
place
and
thereby
place
in
general
since
it
includes
without
being
included
and
moves
without
stirring
from
the
spot
creating
also
its
own
duration
and
thereby
duration
in
general
since
its
movement
is
the
measure
of
all
motion
then
by
degrees
we
shall
see
the
perfection
decrease
more
and
more
down
to
our
sublunary
world
in
which
the
cycle
of
birth
growth
and
decay
imitates
and
mars
the
original
circle
for
the
last
time
so
understood
the
causal
relation
between
god
and
the
world
is
seen
as
an
attraction
when
regarded
from
below
as
an
impulsion
or
a
contact
when
regarded
from
above
since
the
first
heaven
with
its
circular
movement
is
an
imitation
of
god
and
all
imitation
is
the
reception
of
a
form
therefore
we
perceive
god
as
efficient
cause
or
as
final
cause
according
to
the
point
of
view
and
yet
neither
of
these
two
relations
is
the
ultimate
causal
relation
the
true
relation
is
that
which
is
found
between
the
two
members
of
an
equation
when
the
first
member
is
a
single
term
and
the
second
a
sum
of
an
endless
number
of
terms
it
is
we
may
say
the
relation
of
the
to
the
small
change
if
we
suppose
the
change
to
offer
itself
automatically
as
soon
as
the
gold
piece
is
presented
only
thus
can
we
understand
why
aristotle
has
demonstrated
the
necessity
of
a
first
motionless
mover
not
by
founding
it
on
the
assertion
that
the
movement
of
things
must
have
had
a
beginning
but
on
the
contrary
by
affirming
that
this
movement
could
not
have
begun
and
can
never
come
to
an
end
if
movement
exists
or
in
other
words
if
the
small
change
is
being
counted
the
gold
piece
is
to
be
found
somewhere
and
if
the
counting
goes
on
for
ever
having
never
begun
the
single
term
that
is
eminently
equivalent
to
it
must
be
eternal
a
perpetuity
of
mobility
is
possible
only
if
it
is
backed
by
an
eternity
of
immutability
which
it
unwinds
in
a
chain
without
beginning
or
end
such
is
the
last
word
of
the
greek
philosophy
we
have
not
attempted
to
reconstruct
it
it
has
manifold
origins
it
is
connected
by
many
invisible
threads
to
the
soul
of
ancient
greece
vain
therefore
the
effort
to
deduce
it
from
a
simple
principle
but
if
everything
that
has
come
from
poetry
religion
social
life
and
a
still
rudimentary
physics
and
biology
be
removed
from
it
if
we
take
away
all
the
light
material
that
may
have
been
used
in
the
construction
of
the
stately
building
a
solid
framework
remains
and
this
framework
marks
out
the
main
lines
of
a
metaphysic
which
is
we
believe
the
natural
metaphysic
of
the
human
intellect
we
come
to
a
philosophy
of
this
kind
indeed
whenever
we
follow
to
the
end
the
cinematographical
tendency
of
perception
and
thought
our
perception
and
thought
begin
by
substituting
for
the
continuity
of
evolutionary
change
a
series
of
unchangeable
forms
which
are
turn
by
turn
caught
on
the
wing
like
the
rings
at
a
which
the
children
unhook
with
their
little
stick
as
they
are
passing
now
how
can
the
forms
be
passing
and
on
what
stick
are
they
strung
as
the
stable
forms
have
been
obtained
by
extracting
from
change
everything
that
is
definite
there
is
nothing
left
to
characterize
the
instability
on
which
the
forms
are
laid
but
a
negative
attribute
which
must
be
indetermination
itself
such
is
the
first
proceeding
of
our
thought
it
dissociates
each
change
into
two
elements
the
one
stable
definable
for
each
particular
case
to
wit
the
form
the
other
indefinable
and
always
the
same
change
in
general
and
such
also
is
the
essential
operation
of
language
forms
are
all
that
it
is
capable
of
expressing
it
is
reduced
to
taking
as
understood
or
is
limited
to
a
mobility
which
just
because
it
is
always
unexpressed
is
thought
to
remain
in
all
cases
the
then
comes
in
a
philosophy
that
holds
the
dissociation
thus
effected
by
thought
and
language
to
be
legitimate
what
can
it
do
except
objectify
the
distinction
with
more
force
push
it
to
its
extreme
consequences
reduce
it
into
a
system
it
will
therefore
construct
the
real
on
the
one
hand
with
definite
forms
or
immutable
elements
and
on
the
other
with
a
principle
of
mobility
which
being
the
negation
of
the
form
will
by
the
hypothesis
escape
all
definition
and
be
the
purely
indeterminate
the
more
it
directs
its
attention
to
the
forms
delineated
by
thought
and
expressed
by
language
the
more
it
will
see
them
rise
above
the
sensible
and
become
subtilized
into
pure
concepts
capable
of
entering
one
within
the
other
and
even
of
being
at
last
massed
together
into
a
single
concept
the
synthesis
of
all
reality
the
achievement
of
all
perfection
the
more
on
the
contrary
it
descends
toward
the
invisible
source
of
the
universal
mobility
the
more
it
will
feel
this
mobility
sink
beneath
it
and
at
the
same
time
become
void
vanish
into
what
it
will
call
the
finally
it
will
have
on
the
one
hand
the
system
of
ideas
logically
coördinated
together
or
concentrated
into
one
only
on
the
other
a
the
platonic
or
the
aristotelian
matter
but
having
cut
your
cloth
you
must
sew
it
with
ideas
and
an
you
now
have
to
reconstruct
the
sensible
world
you
can
do
so
only
if
you
postulate
a
kind
of
metaphysical
necessity
in
virtue
of
which
the
confronting
of
this
all
with
this
zero
to
the
affirmation
of
all
the
degrees
of
reality
that
measure
the
interval
between
them
just
as
an
undivided
number
when
regarded
as
a
difference
between
itself
and
zero
is
revealed
as
a
certain
sum
of
units
and
with
its
own
affirmation
affirms
all
the
lower
numbers
that
is
the
natural
postulate
it
is
that
also
that
we
perceive
as
the
base
of
the
greek
philosophy
in
order
then
to
explain
the
specific
characters
of
each
of
these
degrees
of
intermediate
reality
nothing
more
is
necessary
than
to
measure
the
distance
that
separates
it
from
the
integral
reality
each
lower
degree
consists
in
a
diminution
of
the
higher
and
the
newness
that
we
perceive
in
it
is
resolved
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
into
a
new
quantity
of
negation
which
is
superadded
to
it
the
smallest
possible
quantity
of
negation
that
which
is
found
already
in
the
highest
forms
of
sensible
reality
and
consequently
in
the
lower
forms
is
that
which
is
expressed
by
the
most
general
attributes
of
sensible
reality
extension
and
duration
by
increasing
degradations
we
will
obtain
attributes
more
and
more
special
here
the
philosopher
fancy
will
have
free
scope
for
it
is
by
an
arbitrary
decree
or
at
least
a
debatable
one
that
a
particular
aspect
of
the
sensible
world
will
be
equated
with
a
particular
diminution
of
being
we
shall
not
necessarily
end
as
aristotle
did
in
a
world
consisting
of
concentric
spheres
turning
on
themselves
but
we
shall
be
led
to
an
analogous
cosmology
i
mean
to
a
construction
whose
pieces
though
all
different
will
have
none
the
less
the
same
relations
between
them
and
this
cosmology
will
be
ruled
by
the
same
principle
the
physical
will
be
defined
by
the
logical
beneath
the
changing
phenomena
will
appear
to
us
by
transparence
a
closed
system
of
concepts
subordinated
to
and
coördinated
with
each
other
science
understood
as
the
system
of
concepts
will
be
more
real
than
the
sensible
reality
it
will
be
prior
to
human
knowledge
which
is
only
able
to
spell
it
letter
by
letter
prior
also
to
things
which
awkwardly
try
to
imitate
it
it
would
only
have
to
be
diverted
an
instant
from
itself
in
order
to
step
out
of
its
eternity
and
thereby
coincide
with
all
this
knowledge
and
all
these
things
its
immutability
is
therefore
indeed
the
cause
of
the
universal
becoming
such
was
the
point
of
view
of
ancient
philosophy
in
regard
to
change
and
duration
that
modern
philosophy
has
repeatedly
but
especially
in
its
beginnings
had
the
wish
to
depart
from
it
seems
to
us
unquestionable
but
an
irresistible
attraction
brings
the
intellect
back
to
its
natural
movement
and
the
metaphysic
of
the
moderns
to
the
general
conclusions
of
the
greek
metaphysic
we
must
try
to
make
this
point
clear
in
order
to
show
by
what
invisible
threads
our
mechanistic
philosophy
remains
bound
to
the
ancient
philosophy
of
ideas
and
how
also
it
responds
to
the
requirements
above
all
practical
of
our
understanding
modern
like
ancient
science
proceeds
according
to
the
cinematographical
method
it
can
not
do
otherwise
all
science
is
subject
to
this
law
for
it
is
of
the
essence
of
science
to
handle
which
it
substitutes
for
the
objects
themselves
these
signs
undoubtedly
differ
from
those
of
language
by
their
greater
precision
and
their
higher
efficacy
they
are
none
the
less
tied
down
to
the
general
condition
of
the
sign
which
is
to
denote
a
fixed
aspect
of
the
reality
under
an
arrested
form
in
order
to
think
movement
a
constantly
renewed
effort
of
the
mind
is
necessary
signs
are
made
to
dispense
us
with
this
effort
by
substituting
for
the
moving
continuity
of
things
an
artificial
reconstruction
which
is
its
equivalent
in
practice
and
has
the
advantage
of
being
easily
handled
but
let
us
leave
aside
the
means
and
consider
only
the
end
what
is
the
essential
object
of
science
it
is
to
enlarge
our
influence
over
things
science
may
be
speculative
in
its
form
disinterested
in
its
immediate
ends
in
other
words
we
may
give
it
as
long
a
credit
as
it
wants
but
however
long
the
day
of
reckoning
may
be
put
off
some
time
or
other
the
payment
must
be
made
it
is
always
then
in
short
practical
utility
that
science
has
in
view
even
when
it
launches
into
theory
it
is
bound
to
adapt
its
behavior
to
the
general
form
of
practice
however
high
it
may
rise
it
must
be
ready
to
fall
back
into
the
field
of
action
and
at
once
to
get
on
its
feet
this
would
not
be
possible
for
it
if
its
rhythm
differed
absolutely
from
that
of
action
itself
now
action
we
have
said
proceeds
by
leaps
to
act
is
to
oneself
to
know
that
is
to
say
to
foresee
in
order
to
act
is
then
to
go
from
situation
to
situation
from
arrangement
to
rearrangement
science
may
consider
rearrangements
that
come
closer
and
closer
to
each
other
it
may
thus
increase
the
number
of
moments
that
it
isolates
but
it
always
isolates
moments
as
to
what
happens
in
the
interval
between
the
moments
science
is
no
more
concerned
with
that
than
are
our
common
intelligence
our
senses
and
our
language
it
does
not
bear
on
the
interval
but
only
on
the
extremities
so
the
cinematographical
method
forces
itself
upon
our
science
as
it
did
already
on
that
of
the
ancients
wherein
then
is
the
difference
between
the
two
sciences
we
indicated
it
when
we
said
that
the
ancients
reduced
the
physical
order
to
the
vital
order
that
is
to
say
laws
to
genera
while
the
moderns
try
to
resolve
genera
into
laws
but
we
have
to
look
at
it
in
another
aspect
which
moreover
is
only
a
transposition
of
the
first
wherein
consists
the
difference
of
attitude
of
the
two
sciences
toward
change
we
may
formulate
it
by
saying
that
science
thinks
it
knows
its
object
sufficiently
when
it
has
noted
of
it
some
privileged
moments
whereas
modern
science
considers
the
object
at
any
moment
the
forms
or
ideas
of
plato
or
of
aristotle
correspond
to
privileged
or
salient
moments
in
the
history
of
things
those
in
general
that
have
been
fixed
by
language
they
are
supposed
like
the
childhood
or
the
old
age
of
a
living
being
to
characterize
a
period
of
which
they
express
the
quintessence
all
the
rest
of
this
period
being
filled
by
the
passage
of
no
interest
in
itself
from
one
form
to
another
form
take
for
instance
a
falling
body
it
was
thought
that
we
got
near
enough
to
the
fact
when
we
characterized
it
as
a
whole
it
was
a
movement
it
was
the
tendency
toward
a
it
was
the
movement
of
a
body
which
separated
from
the
earth
to
which
it
belonged
was
now
going
to
find
its
place
again
they
noted
then
the
final
term
or
culminating
point
greek
telos
akmê
and
set
it
up
as
the
essential
moment
this
moment
that
language
has
retained
in
order
to
express
the
whole
of
the
fact
sufficed
also
for
science
to
characterize
it
in
the
physics
of
aristotle
it
is
by
the
concepts
high
and
low
spontaneous
displacement
and
forced
displacement
own
place
and
strange
place
that
the
movement
of
a
body
shot
into
space
or
falling
freely
is
defined
but
galileo
thought
there
was
no
essential
moment
no
privileged
instant
to
study
the
falling
body
is
to
consider
it
at
it
matters
not
what
moment
in
its
course
the
true
science
of
gravity
is
that
which
will
determine
for
any
moment
of
time
whatever
the
position
of
the
body
in
space
for
this
indeed
signs
far
more
precise
than
those
of
language
are
required
we
may
say
then
that
our
physics
differs
from
that
of
the
ancients
chiefly
in
the
indefinite
breaking
up
of
time
for
the
ancients
time
comprises
as
many
undivided
periods
as
our
natural
perception
and
our
language
cut
out
in
it
successive
facts
each
presenting
a
kind
of
individuality
for
that
reason
each
of
these
facts
admits
in
their
view
of
only
a
definition
or
description
if
in
describing
it
we
are
led
to
distinguish
phases
in
it
we
have
several
facts
instead
of
a
single
one
several
undivided
periods
instead
of
a
single
period
but
time
is
always
supposed
to
be
divided
into
determinate
periods
and
the
mode
of
division
to
be
forced
on
the
mind
by
apparent
crises
of
the
real
comparable
to
that
of
puberty
by
the
apparent
release
of
a
new
for
a
kepler
or
a
galileo
on
the
contrary
time
is
not
divided
objectively
in
one
way
or
another
by
the
matter
that
fills
it
it
has
no
natural
articulations
we
can
we
ought
to
divide
it
as
we
please
all
moments
count
none
of
them
has
the
right
to
set
itself
up
as
a
moment
that
represents
or
dominates
the
others
and
consequently
we
know
a
change
only
when
we
are
able
to
determine
what
it
is
about
at
any
one
of
its
moments
the
difference
is
profound
in
fact
in
a
certain
aspect
it
is
radical
but
from
the
point
of
view
from
which
we
are
regarding
it
it
is
a
difference
of
degree
rather
than
of
kind
the
human
mind
has
passed
from
the
first
kind
of
knowledge
to
the
second
through
gradual
perfecting
simply
by
seeking
a
higher
precision
there
is
the
same
relation
between
these
two
sciences
as
between
the
noting
of
the
phases
of
a
movement
by
the
eye
and
the
much
more
complete
recording
of
these
phases
by
instantaneous
photography
it
is
the
same
cinematographical
mechanism
in
both
cases
but
it
reaches
a
precision
in
the
second
that
it
can
not
have
in
the
first
of
the
gallop
of
a
horse
our
eye
perceives
chiefly
a
characteristic
essential
or
rather
schematic
attitude
a
form
that
appears
to
radiate
over
a
whole
period
and
so
fill
up
a
time
of
gallop
it
is
this
attitude
that
sculpture
has
fixed
on
the
frieze
of
the
parthenon
but
instantaneous
photography
isolates
any
moment
it
puts
them
all
in
the
same
rank
and
thus
the
gallop
of
a
horse
spreads
out
for
it
into
as
many
successive
attitudes
as
it
wishes
instead
of
massing
itself
into
a
single
attitude
which
is
supposed
to
flash
out
in
a
privileged
moment
and
to
illuminate
a
whole
period
from
this
original
difference
flow
all
the
others
a
science
that
considers
one
after
the
other
undivided
periods
of
duration
sees
nothing
but
phases
succeeding
phases
forms
replacing
forms
it
is
content
with
a
description
of
objects
which
it
likens
to
organized
beings
but
when
we
seek
to
know
what
happens
within
one
of
these
periods
at
any
moment
of
time
we
are
aiming
at
something
entirely
different
the
changes
which
are
produced
from
one
moment
to
another
are
no
longer
by
the
hypothesis
changes
of
quality
they
are
variations
it
may
be
of
the
phenomenon
itself
it
may
be
of
its
elementary
parts
we
were
right
then
to
say
that
modern
science
is
distinguishable
from
the
ancient
in
that
it
applies
to
magnitudes
and
proposes
first
and
foremost
to
measure
them
the
ancients
did
indeed
try
experiments
and
on
the
other
hand
kepler
tried
no
experiment
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
in
order
to
discover
a
law
which
is
the
very
type
of
scientific
knowledge
as
we
understand
it
what
distinguishes
modern
science
is
not
that
it
is
experimental
but
that
it
experiments
and
more
generally
works
only
with
a
view
to
measure
for
that
reason
it
is
right
again
to
say
that
ancient
science
applied
to
while
modern
science
seeks
constant
relations
between
variable
magnitudes
the
concept
of
circularity
was
sufficient
to
aristotle
to
define
the
movement
of
the
heavenly
bodies
but
even
with
the
more
accurate
concept
of
elliptical
form
kepler
did
not
think
he
had
accounted
for
the
movement
of
planets
he
had
to
get
a
law
that
is
to
say
a
constant
relation
between
the
quantitative
variations
of
two
or
several
elements
of
the
planetary
movement
yet
these
are
only
consequences
differences
that
follow
from
the
fundamental
difference
it
did
happen
to
the
ancients
accidentally
to
experiment
with
a
view
to
measuring
as
also
to
discover
a
law
expressing
a
constant
relation
between
magnitudes
the
principle
of
archimedes
is
a
true
experimental
law
it
takes
into
account
three
variable
magnitudes
the
volume
of
a
body
the
density
of
the
liquid
in
which
the
body
is
immersed
the
vertical
pressure
that
is
being
exerted
and
it
states
indeed
that
one
of
these
three
terms
is
a
function
of
the
other
two
the
essential
original
difference
must
therefore
be
sought
elsewhere
it
is
the
same
that
we
noticed
first
the
science
of
the
ancients
is
static
either
it
considers
in
block
the
change
that
it
studies
or
if
it
divides
the
change
into
periods
it
makes
of
each
of
these
periods
a
block
in
its
turn
which
amounts
to
saying
that
it
takes
no
account
of
time
but
modern
science
has
been
built
up
around
the
discoveries
of
galileo
and
of
kepler
which
immediately
furnished
it
with
a
model
now
what
do
the
laws
of
kepler
say
they
lay
down
a
relation
between
the
areas
described
by
the
heliocentric
of
a
planet
and
the
employed
in
describing
them
a
relation
between
the
longer
axis
of
the
orbit
and
the
taken
up
by
the
course
and
what
was
the
principle
discovered
by
galileo
a
law
which
connected
the
space
traversed
by
a
falling
body
with
the
occupied
by
the
fall
furthermore
in
what
did
the
first
of
the
great
transformations
of
geometry
in
modern
times
consist
if
not
in
introducing
in
a
veiled
form
it
is
true
time
and
movement
even
in
the
consideration
of
figures
for
the
ancients
geometry
was
a
purely
static
science
figures
were
given
to
it
at
once
completely
finished
like
the
platonic
ideas
but
the
essence
of
the
cartesian
geometry
although
descartes
did
not
give
it
this
form
was
to
regard
every
plane
curve
as
described
by
the
movement
of
a
point
on
a
movable
straight
line
which
is
displaced
parallel
to
itself
along
the
axis
of
the
abscissae
the
displacement
of
the
movable
straight
line
being
supposed
to
be
uniform
and
the
abscissa
thus
becoming
representative
of
the
time
the
curve
is
then
defined
if
we
can
state
the
relation
connecting
the
space
traversed
on
the
movable
straight
line
to
the
time
employed
in
traversing
it
that
is
if
we
are
able
to
indicate
the
position
of
the
movable
point
on
the
straight
line
which
it
traverses
at
any
moment
whatever
of
its
course
this
relation
is
just
what
we
call
the
equation
of
the
curve
to
substitute
an
equation
for
a
figure
consists
therefore
in
seeing
the
actual
position
of
the
moving
points
in
the
tracing
of
the
curve
at
any
moment
whatever
instead
of
regarding
this
tracing
all
at
once
gathered
up
in
the
unique
moment
when
the
curve
has
reached
its
finished
state
such
then
was
the
directing
idea
of
the
reform
by
which
both
the
science
of
nature
and
mathematics
which
serves
as
its
instrument
were
renewed
modern
science
is
the
daughter
of
astronomy
it
has
come
down
from
heaven
to
earth
along
the
inclined
plane
of
galileo
for
it
is
through
galileo
that
newton
and
his
successors
are
connected
with
kepler
now
how
did
the
astronomical
problem
present
itself
to
kepler
the
question
was
knowing
the
respective
positions
of
the
planets
at
a
given
moment
how
to
calculate
their
positions
at
any
other
moment
so
the
same
question
presented
itself
henceforth
for
every
material
system
each
material
point
became
a
rudimentary
planet
and
the
main
question
the
ideal
problem
whose
solution
would
yield
the
key
to
all
the
others
was
the
positions
of
these
elements
at
a
particular
moment
being
given
how
to
determine
their
relative
positions
at
any
moment
no
doubt
the
problem
can
not
be
put
in
these
precise
terms
except
in
very
simple
cases
for
a
schematized
reality
for
we
never
know
the
respective
positions
of
the
real
elements
of
matter
supposing
there
are
real
elements
and
even
if
we
knew
them
at
a
given
moment
the
calculation
of
their
positions
at
another
moment
would
generally
require
a
mathematical
effort
surpassing
human
powers
but
it
is
enough
for
us
to
know
that
these
elements
might
be
known
that
their
present
positions
might
be
noted
and
that
a
superhuman
intellect
might
by
submitting
these
data
to
mathematical
operations
determine
the
positions
of
the
elements
at
any
other
moment
of
time
this
conviction
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
questions
we
put
to
ourselves
on
the
subject
of
nature
and
of
the
methods
we
employ
to
solve
them
that
is
why
every
law
in
static
form
seems
to
us
as
a
provisional
instalment
or
as
a
particular
view
of
a
dynamic
law
which
alone
would
give
us
whole
and
definitive
knowledge
let
us
conclude
then
that
our
science
is
not
only
distinguished
from
ancient
science
in
this
that
it
seeks
laws
nor
even
in
this
that
its
laws
set
forth
relations
between
magnitudes
we
must
add
that
the
magnitude
to
which
we
wish
to
be
able
to
relate
all
others
is
time
and
that
science
must
be
defined
by
its
aspiration
to
take
time
as
an
independent
but
with
what
time
has
it
to
do
we
have
said
before
and
we
can
not
repeat
too
often
that
the
science
of
matter
proceeds
like
ordinary
knowledge
it
perfects
this
knowledge
increases
its
precision
and
its
scope
but
it
works
in
the
same
direction
and
puts
the
same
mechanism
into
play
if
therefore
ordinary
knowledge
by
reason
of
the
cinematographical
mechanism
to
which
it
is
subjected
forbears
to
follow
becoming
in
so
far
as
becoming
is
moving
the
science
of
matter
renounces
it
equally
no
doubt
it
distinguishes
as
great
a
number
of
moments
as
we
wish
in
the
interval
of
time
it
considers
however
small
the
intervals
may
be
at
which
it
stops
it
authorizes
us
to
divide
them
again
if
necessary
in
contrast
with
ancient
science
which
stopped
at
certain
essential
moments
it
is
occupied
indifferently
with
any
moment
whatever
but
it
always
considers
moments
always
virtual
always
in
short
immobilities
which
amounts
to
saying
that
real
time
regarded
as
a
flux
or
in
other
words
as
the
very
mobility
of
being
escapes
the
hold
of
scientific
knowledge
we
have
already
tried
to
establish
this
point
in
a
former
work
we
alluded
to
it
again
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
book
but
it
is
necessary
to
revert
to
it
once
more
in
order
to
clear
up
misunderstandings
when
positive
science
speaks
of
time
what
it
refers
to
is
the
movement
of
a
certain
mobile
t
on
its
trajectory
this
movement
has
been
chosen
by
it
as
representative
of
time
and
it
is
by
definition
uniform
let
us
call
points
which
divide
the
trajectory
of
the
mobile
into
equal
parts
from
its
origin
we
shall
say
that
units
of
time
have
flowed
past
when
the
mobile
is
at
the
points
of
the
line
it
traverses
accordingly
to
consider
the
state
of
the
universe
at
the
end
of
a
certain
time
is
to
examine
where
it
will
be
when
t
is
at
the
point
of
its
course
but
of
the
itself
of
time
still
less
of
its
effect
on
consciousness
there
is
here
no
question
for
there
enter
into
the
calculation
only
the
points
taken
on
the
flux
never
the
flux
itself
we
may
narrow
the
time
considered
as
much
as
we
will
that
is
break
up
at
will
the
interval
between
two
consecutive
divisions
n
and
but
it
is
always
with
points
and
with
points
only
that
we
are
dealing
what
we
retain
of
the
movement
of
the
mobile
t
are
positions
taken
on
its
trajectory
what
we
retain
of
all
the
other
points
of
the
universe
are
their
positions
on
their
respective
trajectories
to
each
of
the
moving
body
t
at
the
points
of
division
we
make
correspond
a
of
all
the
other
mobiles
at
the
points
where
they
are
passing
and
when
we
say
that
a
movement
or
any
other
change
has
occupied
a
time
we
mean
by
it
that
we
have
noted
a
number
of
correspondences
of
this
kind
we
have
therefore
counted
simultaneities
we
have
not
concerned
ourselves
with
the
flux
that
goes
from
one
to
another
the
proof
of
this
is
that
i
can
at
discretion
vary
the
rapidity
of
the
flux
of
the
universe
in
regard
to
a
consciousness
that
is
independent
of
it
and
that
would
perceive
the
variation
by
the
quite
qualitative
that
it
would
have
of
it
whatever
the
variation
had
been
since
the
movement
of
t
would
participate
in
this
variation
i
should
have
nothing
to
change
in
my
equations
nor
in
the
numbers
that
figure
in
them
let
us
go
further
suppose
that
the
rapidity
of
the
flux
becomes
infinite
imagine
as
we
said
in
the
first
pages
of
this
book
that
the
trajectory
of
the
mobile
t
is
given
at
once
and
that
the
whole
history
past
present
and
future
of
the
material
universe
is
spread
out
instantaneously
in
space
the
same
mathematical
correspondences
will
subsist
between
the
moments
of
the
history
of
the
world
unfolded
like
a
fan
so
to
speak
and
the
divisions
of
the
line
which
will
be
called
by
definition
the
course
of
time
in
the
eyes
of
science
nothing
will
have
changed
but
if
time
thus
spreading
itself
out
in
space
and
succession
becoming
juxtaposition
science
has
nothing
to
change
in
what
it
tells
us
we
must
conclude
that
in
what
it
tells
us
it
takes
account
neither
of
in
what
of
it
is
specific
nor
of
in
what
there
is
in
it
that
is
fluent
it
has
no
sign
to
express
what
strikes
our
consciousness
in
succession
and
duration
it
no
more
applies
to
becoming
so
far
as
that
is
moving
than
the
bridges
thrown
here
and
there
across
the
stream
follow
the
water
that
flows
under
their
arches
yet
succession
exists
i
am
conscious
of
it
it
is
a
fact
when
a
physical
process
is
going
on
before
my
eyes
my
perception
and
my
inclination
have
nothing
to
do
with
accelerating
or
retarding
it
what
is
important
to
the
physicist
is
the
of
units
of
duration
the
process
fills
he
does
not
concern
himself
about
the
units
themselves
and
that
is
why
the
successive
states
of
the
world
might
be
spread
out
all
at
once
in
space
without
his
having
to
change
anything
in
his
science
or
to
cease
talking
about
time
but
for
us
conscious
beings
it
is
the
units
that
matter
for
we
do
not
count
extremities
of
intervals
we
feel
and
live
the
intervals
themselves
now
we
are
conscious
of
these
intervals
as
of
intervals
let
me
come
back
again
to
the
sugar
in
my
glass
of
water
why
must
i
wait
for
it
to
melt
while
the
duration
of
the
phenomenon
is
for
the
physicist
since
it
is
reduced
to
a
certain
number
of
units
of
time
and
the
units
themselves
are
indifferent
this
duration
is
an
for
my
consciousness
for
it
coincides
with
a
certain
degree
of
impatience
which
is
rigorously
determined
whence
comes
this
determination
what
is
it
that
obliges
me
to
wait
and
to
wait
for
a
certain
length
of
psychical
duration
which
is
forced
upon
me
over
which
i
have
no
power
if
succession
in
so
far
as
distinct
from
mere
juxtaposition
has
no
real
efficacy
if
time
is
not
a
kind
of
force
why
does
the
universe
unfold
its
successive
states
with
a
velocity
which
in
regard
to
my
consciousness
is
a
veritable
absolute
why
with
this
particular
velocity
rather
than
any
other
why
not
with
an
infinite
velocity
why
in
other
words
is
not
everything
given
at
once
as
on
the
film
of
the
cinematograph
the
more
i
consider
this
point
the
more
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
future
is
bound
to
the
present
instead
of
being
given
alongside
of
it
it
is
because
the
future
is
not
altogether
determined
at
the
present
moment
and
that
if
the
time
taken
up
by
this
succession
is
something
other
than
a
number
if
it
has
for
the
consciousness
that
is
installed
in
it
absolute
value
and
reality
it
is
because
there
is
unceasingly
being
created
in
it
not
indeed
in
any
such
artificially
isolated
system
as
a
glass
of
sugared
water
but
in
the
concrete
whole
of
which
every
such
system
forms
part
something
unforeseeable
and
new
this
duration
may
not
be
the
fact
of
matter
itself
but
that
of
the
life
which
reascends
the
course
of
matter
the
two
movements
are
none
the
less
mutually
dependent
upon
each
other
duration
of
the
universe
must
therefore
be
one
with
the
latitude
of
creation
which
can
find
place
in
when
a
child
plays
at
reconstructing
a
picture
by
putting
together
the
separate
pieces
in
a
puzzle
game
the
more
he
practices
the
more
and
more
quickly
he
succeeds
the
reconstruction
was
moreover
instantaneous
the
child
found
it
when
he
opened
the
box
on
leaving
the
shop
the
operation
therefore
does
not
require
a
definite
time
and
indeed
theoretically
it
does
not
require
any
time
that
is
because
the
result
is
given
it
is
because
the
picture
is
already
created
and
because
to
obtain
it
requires
only
a
work
of
recomposing
and
rearranging
a
work
that
can
be
supposed
going
faster
and
faster
and
even
infinitely
fast
up
to
the
point
of
being
instantaneous
but
to
the
artist
who
creates
a
picture
by
drawing
it
from
the
depths
of
his
soul
time
is
no
longer
an
accessory
it
is
not
an
interval
that
may
be
lengthened
or
shortened
without
the
content
being
altered
the
duration
of
his
work
is
part
and
parcel
of
his
work
to
contract
or
to
dilate
it
would
be
to
modify
both
the
psychical
evolution
that
fills
it
and
the
invention
which
is
its
goal
the
time
taken
up
by
the
invention
is
one
with
the
invention
itself
it
is
the
progress
of
a
thought
which
is
changing
in
the
degree
and
measure
that
it
is
taking
form
it
is
a
vital
process
something
like
the
ripening
of
an
idea
the
painter
is
before
his
canvas
the
colors
are
on
the
palette
the
model
is
sitting
all
this
we
see
and
also
we
know
the
style
do
we
foresee
what
will
appear
on
the
canvas
we
possess
the
elements
of
the
problem
we
know
in
an
abstract
way
how
it
will
be
solved
for
the
portrait
will
surely
resemble
the
model
and
will
surely
resemble
also
the
artist
but
the
concrete
solution
brings
with
it
that
unforeseeable
nothing
which
is
everything
in
a
work
of
art
and
it
is
this
nothing
that
takes
time
nought
as
matter
it
creates
itself
as
form
the
sprouting
and
flowering
of
this
form
are
stretched
out
on
an
unshrinkable
duration
which
is
one
with
their
essence
so
of
the
works
of
nature
their
novelty
arises
from
an
internal
impetus
which
is
progress
or
succession
which
confers
on
succession
a
peculiar
virtue
or
which
owes
to
succession
the
whole
of
its
virtue
which
at
any
rate
makes
succession
or
of
in
time
irreducible
to
a
mere
instantaneous
juxtaposition
in
space
this
is
why
the
idea
of
reading
in
a
present
state
of
the
material
universe
the
future
of
living
forms
and
of
unfolding
now
their
history
yet
to
come
involves
a
veritable
absurdity
but
this
absurdity
is
difficult
to
bring
out
because
our
memory
is
accustomed
to
place
alongside
of
each
other
in
an
ideal
space
the
terms
it
perceives
in
turn
because
it
always
represents
succession
in
the
form
of
juxtaposition
it
is
able
to
do
so
indeed
just
because
the
past
belongs
to
that
which
is
already
invented
to
the
dead
and
no
longer
to
creation
and
to
life
then
as
the
succession
to
come
will
end
by
being
a
succession
past
we
persuade
ourselves
that
the
duration
to
come
admits
of
the
same
treatment
as
past
duration
that
it
is
even
now
unrollable
that
the
future
is
there
rolled
up
already
painted
on
the
canvas
an
illusion
no
doubt
but
an
illusion
that
is
natural
ineradicable
and
that
will
last
as
long
as
the
human
mind
is
invention
or
it
is
nothing
at
but
of
physics
can
take
no
account
restricted
as
it
is
to
the
cinematographical
method
it
is
limited
to
counting
simultaneities
between
the
events
that
make
up
this
time
and
the
positions
of
the
mobile
t
on
its
trajectory
it
detaches
these
events
from
the
whole
which
at
every
moment
puts
on
a
new
form
and
which
communicates
to
them
something
of
its
novelty
it
considers
them
in
the
abstract
such
as
they
would
be
outside
of
the
living
whole
that
is
to
say
in
a
time
unrolled
in
space
it
retains
only
the
events
or
systems
of
events
that
can
be
thus
isolated
without
being
made
to
undergo
too
profound
a
deformation
because
only
these
lend
themselves
to
the
application
of
its
method
our
physics
dates
from
the
day
when
it
was
known
how
to
isolate
such
systems
to
sum
up
modern
physics
is
distinguished
from
ancient
physics
by
the
fact
that
it
considers
any
moment
of
time
whatever
it
rests
altogether
on
a
substitution
of
for
it
seems
then
that
parallel
to
this
physics
a
second
kind
of
knowledge
ought
to
have
grown
up
which
could
have
retained
what
physics
allowed
to
escape
on
the
flux
itself
of
duration
science
neither
would
nor
could
lay
hold
bound
as
it
was
to
the
cinematographical
method
this
second
kind
of
knowledge
would
have
set
the
cinematographical
method
aside
it
would
have
called
upon
the
mind
to
renounce
its
most
cherished
habits
it
is
within
becoming
that
it
would
have
transported
us
by
an
effort
of
sympathy
we
should
no
longer
be
asking
where
a
moving
body
will
be
what
shape
a
system
will
take
through
what
state
a
change
will
pass
at
a
given
moment
the
moments
of
time
which
are
only
arrests
of
our
attention
would
no
longer
exist
it
is
the
flow
of
time
it
is
the
very
flux
of
the
real
that
we
should
be
trying
to
follow
the
first
kind
of
knowledge
has
the
advantage
of
enabling
us
to
foresee
the
future
and
of
making
us
in
some
measure
masters
of
events
in
return
it
retains
of
the
moving
reality
only
eventual
immobilities
that
is
to
say
views
taken
of
it
by
our
mind
it
symbolizes
the
real
and
transposes
it
into
the
human
rather
than
expresses
it
the
other
knowledge
if
it
is
possible
is
practically
useless
it
will
not
extend
our
empire
over
nature
it
will
even
go
against
certain
natural
aspirations
of
the
intellect
but
if
it
succeeds
it
is
reality
itself
that
it
will
hold
in
a
firm
and
final
embrace
not
only
may
we
thus
complete
the
intellect
and
its
knowledge
of
matter
by
accustoming
it
to
install
itself
within
the
moving
but
by
developing
also
another
faculty
complementary
to
the
intellect
we
may
open
a
perspective
on
the
other
half
of
the
real
for
as
soon
as
we
are
confronted
with
true
duration
we
see
that
it
means
creation
and
that
if
that
which
is
being
unmade
endures
it
can
only
be
because
it
is
inseparably
bound
to
what
is
making
itself
thus
will
appear
the
necessity
of
a
continual
growth
of
the
universe
i
should
say
of
a
of
the
real
and
thus
will
be
seen
in
a
new
light
the
life
which
we
find
on
the
surface
of
our
planet
a
life
directed
the
same
way
as
that
of
the
universe
and
inverse
of
materiality
to
intellect
in
short
there
will
be
added
intuition
the
more
we
reflect
on
it
the
more
we
shall
find
that
this
conception
of
metaphysics
is
that
which
modern
science
suggests
for
the
ancients
indeed
time
is
theoretically
negligible
because
the
duration
of
a
thing
only
manifests
the
degradation
of
its
essence
it
is
with
this
motionless
essence
that
science
has
to
deal
change
being
only
the
effort
of
a
form
toward
its
own
realization
the
realization
is
all
that
it
concerns
us
to
know
no
doubt
the
realization
is
never
complete
it
is
this
that
ancient
philosophy
expresses
by
saying
that
we
do
not
perceive
form
without
matter
but
if
we
consider
the
changing
object
at
a
certain
essential
moment
at
its
apogee
we
may
say
that
there
it
just
touches
its
intelligible
form
this
intelligible
form
this
ideal
and
so
to
speak
limiting
form
our
science
seizes
upon
and
possessing
in
this
the
it
holds
eminently
the
small
money
which
we
call
becoming
or
change
this
change
is
less
than
being
the
knowledge
that
would
take
it
for
object
supposing
such
knowledge
were
possible
would
be
less
than
science
but
for
a
science
that
places
all
the
moments
of
time
in
the
same
rank
that
admits
no
essential
moment
no
culminating
point
no
apogee
change
is
no
longer
a
diminution
of
essence
duration
is
not
a
dilution
of
eternity
the
flux
of
time
is
the
reality
itself
and
the
things
which
we
study
are
the
things
which
flow
it
is
true
that
of
this
flowing
reality
we
are
limited
to
taking
instantaneous
views
but
just
because
of
this
scientific
knowledge
must
appeal
to
another
knowledge
to
complete
it
while
the
ancient
conception
of
scientific
knowledge
ended
in
making
time
a
degradation
and
change
the
diminution
of
a
form
given
from
all
eternity
on
the
contrary
by
following
the
new
conception
to
the
end
we
should
come
to
see
in
time
a
progressive
growth
of
the
absolute
and
in
the
evolution
of
things
a
continual
invention
of
forms
ever
new
it
is
true
that
it
would
be
to
break
with
the
metaphysics
of
the
ancients
they
saw
only
one
way
of
knowing
definitely
their
science
consisted
in
a
scattered
and
fragmentary
metaphysics
their
metaphysics
in
a
concentrated
and
systematic
science
their
science
and
metaphysics
were
at
most
two
species
of
one
and
the
same
genus
in
our
hypothesis
on
the
contrary
science
and
metaphysics
are
two
opposed
although
complementary
ways
of
knowing
the
first
retaining
only
moments
that
is
to
say
that
which
does
not
endure
the
second
bearing
on
duration
itself
now
it
was
natural
to
hesitate
between
so
novel
a
conception
of
metaphysics
and
the
traditional
conception
the
temptation
must
have
been
strong
to
repeat
with
the
new
science
what
had
been
tried
on
the
old
to
suppose
our
scientific
knowledge
of
nature
completed
at
once
to
unify
it
entirely
and
to
give
to
this
unification
as
the
greeks
had
already
done
the
name
of
metaphysics
so
beside
the
new
way
that
philosophy
might
have
prepared
the
old
remained
open
that
indeed
which
physics
trod
and
as
physics
retained
of
time
only
what
could
as
well
be
spread
out
all
at
once
in
space
the
metaphysics
that
chose
the
same
direction
had
necessarily
to
proceed
as
if
time
created
and
annihilated
nothing
as
if
duration
had
no
efficacy
bound
like
the
physics
of
the
moderns
and
the
metaphysics
of
the
ancients
to
the
cinematographical
method
it
ended
with
the
conclusion
implicitly
admitted
at
the
start
and
immanent
in
the
method
itself
is
that
metaphysics
hesitated
at
first
between
the
two
paths
seems
to
us
unquestionable
the
indecision
is
visible
in
cartesianism
on
the
one
hand
descartes
affirms
universal
mechanism
from
this
point
of
view
movement
would
be
relative
and
as
time
has
just
as
much
reality
as
movement
it
would
follow
that
past
present
and
future
are
given
from
all
eternity
but
on
the
other
hand
and
that
is
why
the
philosopher
has
not
gone
to
these
extreme
consequences
descartes
believes
in
the
free
will
of
man
he
superposes
on
the
determinism
of
physical
phenomena
the
indeterminism
of
human
actions
and
consequently
on
a
time
in
which
there
is
invention
creation
true
succession
this
duration
he
supports
on
a
god
who
is
unceasingly
renewing
the
creative
act
and
who
being
thus
tangent
to
time
and
becoming
sustains
them
communicates
to
them
necessarily
something
of
his
absolute
reality
when
he
places
himself
at
this
second
point
of
view
descartes
speaks
of
movement
even
spatial
as
of
an
absolute
he
therefore
entered
both
roads
one
after
the
other
having
resolved
to
follow
neither
of
them
to
the
end
the
first
would
have
led
him
to
the
denial
of
free
will
in
man
and
of
real
will
in
god
it
was
the
suppression
of
all
efficient
duration
the
likening
of
the
universe
to
a
thing
given
which
a
superhuman
intelligence
would
embrace
at
once
in
a
moment
or
in
eternity
in
following
the
second
on
the
contrary
he
would
have
been
led
to
all
the
consequences
which
the
intuition
of
true
duration
implies
creation
would
have
appeared
not
simply
as
but
also
as
the
universe
regarded
as
a
whole
would
really
evolve
the
future
would
no
longer
be
determinable
by
the
present
at
most
we
might
say
that
once
realized
it
can
be
found
again
in
its
antecedents
as
the
sounds
of
a
new
language
can
be
expressed
with
the
letters
of
an
old
alphabet
if
we
agree
to
enlarge
the
value
of
the
letters
and
to
attribute
to
them
sounds
which
no
combination
of
the
old
sounds
could
have
produced
beforehand
finally
the
mechanistic
explanation
might
have
remained
universal
in
this
that
it
can
indeed
be
extended
to
as
many
systems
as
we
choose
to
cut
out
in
the
continuity
of
the
universe
but
mechanism
would
then
have
become
a
rather
than
a
it
would
have
expressed
the
fact
that
science
must
proceed
after
the
cinematographical
manner
that
the
function
of
science
is
to
scan
the
rhythm
of
the
flow
of
things
and
not
to
fit
itself
into
that
such
were
the
two
opposite
conceptions
of
metaphysics
which
were
offered
to
philosophy
it
chose
the
first
the
reason
of
this
choice
is
undoubtedly
the
tendency
to
follow
the
cinematographical
method
a
method
so
natural
to
our
intellect
and
so
well
adjusted
also
to
the
requirements
of
our
science
that
we
must
feel
doubly
sure
of
its
speculative
impotence
to
renounce
it
in
metaphysics
but
ancient
philosophy
also
influenced
the
choice
artists
for
ever
admirable
the
greeks
created
a
type
of
truth
as
of
sensible
beauty
whose
attraction
is
hard
to
resist
as
soon
as
we
incline
to
make
metaphysics
a
systematization
of
science
we
glide
in
the
direction
of
plato
and
of
aristotle
and
once
in
the
zone
of
attraction
in
which
the
greek
philosophers
moved
we
are
drawn
along
in
their
orbit
such
was
the
case
with
leibniz
as
also
with
spinoza
we
are
not
blind
to
the
treasures
of
originality
their
doctrines
contain
spinoza
and
leibniz
have
poured
into
them
the
whole
content
of
their
souls
rich
with
the
inventions
of
their
genius
and
the
acquisitions
of
modern
thought
and
there
are
in
each
of
them
especially
in
spinoza
flashes
of
intuition
that
break
through
the
system
but
if
we
leave
out
of
the
two
doctrines
what
breathes
life
into
them
if
we
retain
the
skeleton
only
we
have
before
us
the
very
picture
of
platonism
and
aristotelianism
seen
through
cartesian
mechanism
they
present
to
us
a
systematization
of
the
new
physics
constructed
on
the
model
of
the
ancient
metaphysics
what
indeed
could
the
unification
of
physics
be
the
inspiring
idea
of
that
science
was
to
isolate
within
the
universe
systems
of
material
points
such
that
the
position
of
each
of
these
points
being
known
at
a
given
moment
we
could
then
calculate
it
for
any
moment
whatever
as
moreover
the
systems
thus
defined
were
the
only
ones
on
which
the
new
science
had
hold
and
as
it
could
not
be
known
beforehand
whether
a
system
satisfied
or
did
not
satisfy
the
desired
condition
it
was
useful
to
proceed
always
and
everywhere
the
condition
was
realized
there
was
in
this
a
methodological
rule
a
very
natural
rule
so
natural
indeed
that
it
was
not
even
necessary
to
formulate
it
for
simple
common
sense
tells
us
that
when
we
are
possessed
of
an
effective
instrument
of
research
and
are
ignorant
of
the
limits
of
its
applicability
we
should
act
as
if
its
applicability
were
unlimited
there
will
always
be
time
to
abate
it
but
the
temptation
must
have
been
great
for
the
philosopher
to
hypostatize
this
hope
or
rather
this
impetus
of
the
new
science
and
to
convert
a
general
rule
of
method
into
a
fundamental
law
of
things
so
he
transported
himself
at
once
to
the
limit
he
supposed
physics
to
have
become
complete
and
to
embrace
the
whole
of
the
sensible
world
the
universe
became
a
system
of
points
the
position
of
which
was
rigorously
determined
at
each
instant
by
relation
to
the
preceding
instant
and
theoretically
calculable
for
any
moment
whatever
the
result
in
short
was
universal
mechanism
but
it
was
not
enough
to
formulate
this
mechanism
what
was
required
was
to
found
it
to
give
the
reason
for
it
and
prove
its
necessity
and
the
essential
affirmation
of
mechanism
being
that
of
a
reciprocal
mathematical
dependence
of
all
the
points
of
the
universe
as
also
of
all
the
moments
of
the
universe
the
reason
of
mechanism
had
to
be
discovered
in
the
unity
of
a
principle
into
which
could
be
contracted
all
that
is
juxtaposed
in
space
and
successive
in
time
hence
the
whole
of
the
real
was
supposed
to
be
given
at
once
the
reciprocal
determination
of
the
juxtaposed
appearances
in
space
was
explained
by
the
indivisibility
of
true
being
and
the
inflexible
determinism
of
successive
phenomena
in
time
simply
expressed
that
the
whole
of
being
is
given
in
the
eternal
the
new
philosophy
was
going
then
to
be
a
recommencement
or
rather
a
transposition
of
the
old
the
ancient
philosophy
had
taken
each
of
the
into
which
a
becoming
is
concentrated
or
which
mark
its
apogee
it
supposed
them
all
known
and
gathered
them
up
into
a
single
concept
form
of
forms
idea
of
ideas
like
the
god
of
aristotle
the
new
philosophy
was
going
to
take
each
of
the
which
condition
a
becoming
in
relation
to
others
and
which
are
as
the
permanent
substratum
of
phenomena
it
would
suppose
them
all
known
and
would
gather
them
up
into
a
unity
which
also
would
express
them
eminently
but
which
like
the
god
of
aristotle
and
for
the
same
reasons
must
remain
immutably
shut
up
in
itself
true
this
return
to
the
ancient
philosophy
was
not
without
great
difficulties
when
a
plato
an
aristotle
or
a
plotinus
melt
all
the
concepts
of
their
science
into
a
single
one
in
so
doing
they
embrace
the
whole
of
the
real
for
concepts
are
supposed
to
represent
the
things
themselves
and
to
possess
at
least
as
much
positive
content
but
a
law
in
general
expresses
only
a
relation
and
physical
laws
in
particular
express
only
relations
between
concrete
things
so
that
if
a
modern
philosopher
works
with
the
laws
of
the
new
science
as
the
greek
philosopher
did
with
the
concepts
of
the
ancient
science
if
he
makes
all
the
conclusions
of
a
physics
supposed
omniscient
converge
on
a
single
point
he
neglects
what
is
concrete
in
the
phenomena
the
qualities
perceived
the
perceptions
themselves
his
synthesis
comprises
it
seems
only
a
fraction
of
reality
in
fact
the
first
result
of
the
new
science
was
to
cut
the
real
into
two
halves
quantity
and
quality
the
former
being
credited
to
the
account
of
and
the
latter
to
the
account
of
the
ancients
had
raised
no
such
barriers
either
between
quality
and
quantity
or
between
soul
and
body
for
them
the
mathematical
concepts
were
concepts
like
the
others
related
to
the
others
and
fitting
quite
naturally
into
the
hierarchy
of
the
ideas
neither
was
the
body
then
defined
by
geometrical
extension
nor
the
soul
by
consciousness
if
the
greek
psychê
of
aristotle
the
entelechy
of
a
living
body
is
less
spiritual
than
our
soul
it
is
because
his
greek
oôma
already
impregnated
with
the
idea
is
less
corporeal
than
our
body
the
scission
was
not
yet
irremediable
between
the
two
terms
it
has
become
so
and
thence
a
metaphysic
that
aims
at
an
abstract
unity
must
resign
itself
either
to
comprehend
in
its
synthesis
only
one
half
of
the
real
or
to
take
advantage
of
the
absolute
heterogeneity
of
the
two
halves
in
order
to
consider
one
as
a
translation
of
the
other
different
phrases
will
express
different
things
if
they
belong
to
the
same
language
that
is
to
say
if
there
is
a
certain
relationship
of
sound
between
them
but
if
they
belong
to
two
different
languages
they
might
just
because
of
their
radical
diversity
of
sound
express
the
same
thing
so
of
quality
and
quantity
of
soul
and
body
it
is
for
having
cut
all
connection
between
the
two
terms
that
philosophers
have
been
led
to
establish
between
them
a
rigorous
parallelism
of
which
the
ancients
had
not
dreamed
to
regard
them
as
translations
and
not
as
inversions
of
each
other
in
short
to
posit
a
fundamental
identity
as
a
substratum
to
their
duality
the
synthesis
to
which
they
rose
thus
became
capable
of
embracing
everything
a
divine
mechanism
made
the
phenomena
of
thought
to
correspond
to
those
of
extension
each
to
each
qualities
to
quantities
souls
to
bodies
it
is
this
parallelism
that
we
find
both
in
leibniz
and
in
spinoza
in
different
forms
it
is
true
because
of
the
unequal
importance
which
they
attach
to
extension
with
spinoza
the
two
terms
thought
and
extension
are
placed
in
principle
at
least
in
the
same
rank
they
are
therefore
two
translations
of
one
and
the
same
original
or
as
spinoza
says
two
attributes
of
one
and
the
same
substance
which
we
must
call
god
and
these
two
translations
as
also
an
infinity
of
others
into
languages
which
we
know
not
are
called
up
and
even
forced
into
existence
by
the
original
just
as
the
essence
of
the
circle
is
translated
automatically
so
to
speak
both
by
a
figure
and
by
an
equation
for
leibniz
on
the
contrary
extension
is
indeed
still
a
translation
but
it
is
thought
that
is
the
original
and
thought
might
dispense
with
translation
the
translation
being
made
only
for
us
in
positing
god
we
necessarily
posit
also
all
the
possible
views
of
god
that
is
to
say
the
monads
but
we
can
always
imagine
that
a
view
has
been
taken
from
a
point
of
view
and
it
is
natural
for
an
imperfect
mind
like
ours
to
class
views
qualitatively
different
according
to
the
order
and
position
of
points
of
view
qualitatively
identical
from
which
the
views
might
have
been
taken
in
reality
the
points
of
view
do
not
exist
for
there
are
only
views
each
given
in
an
indivisible
block
and
representing
in
its
own
way
the
whole
of
reality
which
is
god
but
we
need
to
express
the
plurality
of
the
views
that
are
each
other
by
the
multiplicity
of
the
points
of
view
that
are
to
each
other
and
we
also
need
to
symbolize
the
more
or
less
close
relationship
between
the
views
by
the
relative
situation
of
the
points
of
view
to
one
another
their
nearness
or
their
distance
that
is
to
say
by
a
magnitude
that
is
what
leibniz
means
when
he
says
that
space
is
the
order
of
coexistents
that
the
perception
of
extension
is
a
confused
perception
that
is
to
say
a
perception
relative
to
an
imperfect
mind
and
that
nothing
exists
but
monads
expressing
thereby
that
the
real
whole
has
no
parts
but
is
repeated
to
infinity
each
time
integrally
though
diversely
within
itself
and
that
all
these
repetitions
are
complementary
to
each
other
in
just
the
same
way
the
visible
relief
of
an
object
is
equivalent
to
the
whole
set
of
stereoscopic
views
taken
of
it
from
all
points
so
that
instead
of
seeing
in
the
relief
a
juxtaposition
of
solid
parts
we
might
quite
as
well
look
upon
it
as
made
of
the
of
these
whole
views
each
given
in
block
each
indivisible
each
different
from
all
the
others
and
yet
representative
of
the
same
thing
the
whole
that
is
to
say
god
is
this
very
relief
for
leibniz
and
the
monads
are
these
complementary
plane
views
for
that
reason
he
defines
god
as
the
substance
that
has
no
point
of
view
or
again
as
the
universal
harmony
that
is
to
say
the
reciprocal
complementarity
of
monads
in
short
leibniz
differs
from
spinoza
in
this
that
he
looks
upon
the
universal
mechanism
as
an
aspect
which
reality
takes
for
us
whereas
spinoza
makes
of
it
an
aspect
which
reality
takes
for
itself
it
is
true
that
after
having
concentrated
in
god
the
whole
of
the
real
it
became
difficult
for
them
to
pass
from
god
to
things
from
eternity
to
time
the
difficulty
was
even
much
greater
for
these
philosophers
than
an
aristotle
or
a
plotinus
the
god
of
aristotle
indeed
had
been
obtained
by
the
compression
and
reciprocal
compenetration
of
the
ideas
that
represent
in
their
finished
state
or
in
their
culminating
point
the
changing
things
of
the
world
he
was
therefore
transcendent
to
the
world
and
the
duration
of
things
was
juxtaposed
to
his
eternity
of
which
it
was
only
a
weakening
but
in
the
principle
to
which
we
are
led
by
the
consideration
of
universal
mechanism
and
which
must
serve
as
its
substratum
it
is
not
concepts
or
but
laws
or
that
are
condensed
now
a
relation
does
not
exist
separately
a
law
connects
changing
terms
and
is
immanent
in
what
it
governs
the
principle
in
which
all
these
relations
are
ultimately
summed
up
and
which
is
the
basis
of
the
unity
of
nature
can
not
therefore
be
transcendent
to
sensible
reality
it
is
immanent
in
it
and
we
must
suppose
that
it
is
at
once
both
in
and
out
of
time
gathered
up
in
the
unity
of
its
substance
and
yet
condemned
to
wind
it
off
in
an
endless
chain
rather
than
formulate
so
appalling
a
contradiction
the
philosophers
were
necessarily
led
to
sacrifice
the
weaker
of
the
two
terms
and
to
regard
the
temporal
aspect
of
things
as
a
mere
illusion
leibniz
says
so
in
explicit
terms
for
he
makes
of
time
as
of
space
a
confused
perception
while
the
multiplicity
of
his
monads
expresses
only
the
diversity
of
views
taken
of
the
whole
the
history
of
an
isolated
monad
seems
to
be
hardly
anything
else
than
the
manifold
views
that
it
can
take
of
its
own
substance
so
that
time
would
consist
in
all
the
points
of
view
that
each
monad
can
assume
towards
itself
as
space
consists
in
all
the
points
of
view
that
all
monads
can
assume
towards
god
but
the
thought
of
spinoza
is
much
less
clear
and
this
philosopher
seems
to
have
sought
to
establish
between
eternity
and
that
which
has
duration
the
same
difference
as
aristotle
made
between
essence
and
accidents
a
most
difficult
undertaking
for
the
greek
ylê
of
aristotle
was
no
longer
there
to
measure
the
distance
and
explain
the
passage
from
the
essential
to
the
accidental
descartes
having
eliminated
it
for
ever
however
that
may
be
the
deeper
we
go
into
the
spinozistic
conception
of
the
inadequate
as
related
to
the
adequate
the
more
we
feel
ourselves
moving
in
the
direction
of
aristotelianism
just
as
the
leibnizian
monads
in
proportion
as
they
mark
themselves
out
the
more
clearly
tend
to
approximate
to
the
intelligibles
of
plotinus
the
natural
trend
of
these
two
philosophies
brings
them
back
to
the
conclusions
of
the
ancient
philosophy
to
sum
up
the
resemblances
of
this
new
metaphysic
to
that
of
the
ancients
arise
from
the
fact
that
both
suppose
the
former
above
the
sensible
the
latter
within
the
sensible
a
science
one
and
complete
with
which
any
reality
that
the
sensible
may
contain
is
believed
to
coincide
both
reality
as
well
as
truth
are
integrally
given
in
both
are
opposed
to
the
idea
of
a
reality
that
creates
itself
gradually
that
is
at
bottom
to
an
absolute
duration
now
it
might
easily
be
shown
that
the
conclusions
of
this
metaphysic
springing
from
science
have
rebounded
upon
science
itself
as
it
were
by
ricochet
they
penetrate
the
whole
of
our
empiricism
physics
and
chemistry
study
only
inert
matter
biology
when
it
treats
the
living
being
physically
and
chemically
considers
only
the
inert
side
of
the
living
hence
the
mechanistic
explanations
in
spite
of
their
development
include
only
a
small
part
of
the
real
to
suppose
that
the
whole
of
the
real
is
resolvable
into
elements
of
this
kind
or
at
least
that
mechanism
can
give
a
complete
translation
of
what
happens
in
the
world
is
to
pronounce
for
a
certain
metaphysic
the
very
metaphysic
of
which
spinoza
and
leibniz
have
laid
down
the
principles
and
drawn
the
consequences
certainly
the
who
affirms
the
exact
equivalence
of
the
cerebral
and
the
psychical
state
who
imagines
the
possibility
for
some
superhuman
intellect
of
reading
in
the
brain
what
is
going
on
in
consciousness
believes
himself
very
far
from
the
metaphysicians
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
very
near
to
experience
yet
experience
pure
and
simple
tells
us
nothing
of
the
kind
it
shows
us
the
interdependence
of
the
mental
and
the
physical
the
necessity
of
a
certain
cerebral
substratum
for
the
psychical
state
nothing
more
from
the
fact
that
two
things
are
mutually
dependent
it
does
not
follow
that
they
are
equivalent
because
a
certain
screw
is
necessary
to
a
certain
machine
because
the
machine
works
when
the
screw
is
there
and
stops
when
the
screw
is
taken
away
we
do
not
say
that
the
screw
is
the
equivalent
of
the
machine
for
correspondence
to
be
equivalence
it
would
be
necessary
that
to
any
part
of
the
machine
a
definite
part
of
the
screw
should
correspond
as
in
a
literal
translation
in
which
each
chapter
renders
a
chapter
each
sentence
a
sentence
each
word
a
word
now
the
relation
of
the
brain
to
consciousness
seems
to
be
entirely
different
not
only
does
the
hypothesis
of
an
equivalence
between
the
psychical
state
and
the
cerebral
state
imply
a
downright
absurdity
as
we
have
tried
to
prove
in
a
former
essay
but
the
facts
examined
without
prejudice
certainly
seem
to
indicate
that
the
relation
of
the
psychical
to
the
physical
is
just
that
of
the
machine
to
the
screw
to
speak
of
an
equivalence
between
the
two
is
simply
to
curtail
and
make
almost
unintelligible
the
spinozistic
or
leibnizian
metaphysic
it
is
to
accept
this
philosophy
such
as
it
is
on
the
side
of
extension
but
to
mutilate
it
on
the
side
of
thought
with
spinoza
with
leibniz
we
suppose
the
unifying
synthesis
of
the
phenomena
of
matter
achieved
and
everything
in
matter
explained
mechanically
but
for
the
conscious
facts
we
no
longer
push
the
synthesis
to
the
end
we
stop
we
suppose
consciousness
to
be
coextensive
with
a
certain
part
of
nature
and
not
with
all
of
it
we
are
thus
led
sometimes
to
an
epiphenomenalism
that
associates
consciousness
with
certain
particular
vibrations
and
puts
it
here
and
there
in
the
world
in
a
sporadic
state
and
sometimes
to
a
monism
that
scatters
consciousness
into
as
many
tiny
grains
as
there
are
atoms
but
in
either
case
it
is
to
an
incomplete
spinozism
or
to
an
incomplete
leibnizianism
that
we
come
back
between
this
conception
of
nature
and
cartesianism
we
find
moreover
intermediate
historical
stages
the
medical
philosophers
of
the
eighteenth
century
with
their
cramped
cartesianism
have
had
a
great
part
in
the
genesis
of
the
epiphenomenalism
and
monism
of
the
present
day
these
doctrines
are
thus
found
to
fall
short
of
the
kantian
criticism
certainly
the
philosophy
of
kant
is
also
imbued
with
the
belief
in
a
science
single
and
complete
embracing
the
whole
of
the
real
indeed
looked
at
from
one
aspect
it
is
only
a
continuation
of
the
metaphysics
of
the
moderns
and
a
transposition
of
the
ancient
metaphysics
spinoza
and
leibniz
had
following
aristotle
hypostatized
in
god
the
unity
of
knowledge
the
kantian
criticism
on
one
side
at
least
consists
in
asking
whether
the
whole
of
this
hypothesis
is
necessary
to
modern
science
as
it
was
to
ancient
science
or
if
part
of
the
hypothesis
is
not
sufficient
for
the
ancients
science
applied
to
that
is
to
say
to
kinds
of
in
compressing
all
concepts
into
one
they
therefore
necessarily
arrived
at
a
which
we
may
call
thought
but
which
was
rather
than
when
aristotle
defined
god
the
greek
noêseôs
noêsis
it
is
probably
on
greek
noêseôs
and
not
on
greek
noêsis
that
he
put
the
emphasis
god
was
the
synthesis
of
all
concepts
the
idea
of
ideas
but
modern
science
turns
on
laws
that
is
on
relations
now
a
relation
is
a
bond
established
by
a
mind
between
two
or
more
terms
a
relation
is
nothing
outside
of
the
intellect
that
relates
the
universe
therefore
can
only
be
a
system
of
laws
if
phenomena
have
passed
beforehand
through
the
filter
of
an
intellect
of
course
this
intellect
might
be
that
of
a
being
infinitely
superior
to
man
who
would
found
the
materiality
of
things
at
the
same
time
that
he
bound
them
together
such
was
the
hypothesis
of
leibniz
and
of
spinoza
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
so
far
and
for
the
effect
we
have
here
to
obtain
the
human
intellect
is
enough
such
is
precisely
the
kantian
solution
between
the
dogmatism
of
a
spinoza
or
a
leibniz
and
the
criticism
of
kant
there
is
just
the
same
distance
as
between
it
may
be
maintained
that
and
it
suffices
that
kant
stops
this
dogmatism
on
the
incline
that
was
making
it
slip
too
far
toward
the
greek
metaphysics
he
reduces
to
the
strict
minimum
the
hypothesis
which
is
necessary
in
order
to
suppose
the
physics
of
galileo
indefinitely
extensible
true
when
he
speaks
of
the
human
intellect
he
means
neither
yours
nor
mine
the
unity
of
nature
comes
indeed
from
the
human
understanding
that
unifies
but
the
unifying
function
that
operates
here
is
impersonal
it
imparts
itself
to
our
individual
consciousnesses
but
it
transcends
them
it
is
much
less
than
a
substantial
god
it
is
however
a
little
more
than
the
isolated
work
of
a
man
or
even
than
the
collective
work
of
humanity
it
does
not
exactly
lie
within
man
rather
man
lies
within
it
as
in
an
atmosphere
of
intellectuality
which
his
consciousness
breathes
it
is
if
we
will
a
god
something
that
in
kant
is
not
yet
divine
but
which
tends
to
become
so
it
became
so
indeed
with
fichte
with
kant
however
its
principal
rôle
was
to
give
to
the
whole
of
our
science
a
relative
and
character
although
of
a
humanity
already
somewhat
deified
from
this
point
of
view
the
criticism
of
kant
consisted
chiefly
in
limiting
the
dogmatism
of
his
predecessors
accepting
their
conception
of
science
and
reducing
to
a
minimum
the
metaphysic
it
implied
but
it
is
otherwise
with
the
kantian
distinction
between
the
matter
of
knowledge
and
its
form
by
regarding
intelligence
as
a
faculty
of
establishing
relations
kant
attributed
an
origin
to
the
terms
between
which
the
relations
are
established
he
affirmed
against
his
immediate
predecessors
that
knowledge
is
not
entirely
resolvable
into
terms
of
intelligence
he
brought
back
into
philosophy
while
modifying
it
and
carrying
it
on
to
another
plane
that
essential
element
of
the
philosophy
of
descartes
which
had
been
abandoned
by
the
cartesians
thereby
he
prepared
the
way
for
a
new
philosophy
which
might
have
established
itself
in
the
matter
of
knowledge
by
a
higher
effort
of
intuition
coinciding
with
this
matter
adopting
the
same
rhythm
and
the
same
movement
might
not
consciousness
by
two
efforts
of
opposite
direction
raising
itself
and
lowering
itself
by
turns
become
able
to
grasp
from
within
and
no
longer
perceive
only
from
without
the
two
forms
of
reality
body
and
mind
would
not
this
twofold
effort
make
us
as
far
as
that
is
possible
the
absolute
moreover
as
in
the
course
of
this
operation
we
should
see
intellect
spring
up
of
itself
cut
itself
out
in
the
whole
of
mind
intellectual
knowledge
would
then
appear
as
it
is
limited
but
not
relative
such
was
the
direction
that
kantianism
might
have
pointed
out
to
a
revivified
cartesianism
but
in
this
direction
kant
himself
did
not
go
he
not
because
while
assigning
to
knowledge
an
matter
he
believed
this
matter
to
be
either
coextensive
with
intellect
or
less
extensive
than
intellect
therefore
he
could
not
dream
of
cutting
out
intellect
in
it
nor
consequently
of
tracing
the
genesis
of
the
understanding
and
its
categories
the
molds
of
the
understanding
and
the
understanding
itself
had
to
be
accepted
as
they
are
already
made
between
the
matter
presented
to
our
intellect
and
this
intellect
itself
there
was
no
relationship
the
agreement
between
the
two
was
due
to
the
fact
that
intellect
imposed
its
form
on
matter
so
that
not
only
was
it
necessary
to
posit
the
intellectual
form
of
knowledge
as
a
kind
of
absolute
and
give
up
the
quest
of
its
genesis
but
the
very
matter
of
this
knowledge
seemed
too
ground
down
by
the
intellect
for
us
to
be
able
to
hope
to
get
it
back
in
its
original
purity
it
was
not
the
it
was
only
the
refraction
of
it
through
our
atmosphere
if
now
we
inquire
why
kant
did
not
believe
that
the
matter
of
our
knowledge
extends
beyond
its
form
this
is
what
we
find
the
criticism
of
our
knowledge
of
nature
that
was
instituted
by
kant
consisted
in
ascertaining
what
our
mind
must
be
and
what
nature
must
be
the
claims
of
our
science
are
justified
but
of
these
claims
themselves
kant
has
not
made
the
criticism
i
mean
that
he
took
for
granted
the
idea
of
a
science
that
is
one
capable
of
binding
with
the
same
force
all
the
parts
of
what
is
given
and
of
coördinating
them
into
a
system
presenting
on
all
sides
an
equal
solidity
he
did
not
consider
in
his
of
pure
that
science
became
less
and
less
objective
more
and
more
symbolical
to
the
extent
that
it
went
from
the
physical
to
the
vital
from
the
vital
to
the
psychical
experience
does
not
move
to
his
view
in
two
different
and
perhaps
opposite
ways
the
one
conformable
to
the
direction
of
the
intellect
the
other
contrary
to
it
there
is
for
him
only
experience
and
the
intellect
covers
its
whole
ground
this
is
what
kant
expresses
by
saying
that
all
our
intuitions
are
sensuous
or
in
other
words
and
this
would
have
to
be
admitted
indeed
if
our
science
presented
in
all
its
parts
an
equal
objectivity
but
suppose
on
the
contrary
that
science
is
less
and
less
objective
more
and
more
symbolical
as
it
goes
from
the
physical
to
the
psychical
passing
through
the
vital
then
as
it
is
indeed
necessary
to
perceive
a
thing
somehow
in
order
to
symbolize
it
there
would
be
an
intuition
of
the
psychical
and
more
generally
of
the
vital
which
the
intellect
would
transpose
and
translate
no
doubt
but
which
would
none
the
less
transcend
the
intellect
there
would
be
in
other
words
a
intuition
if
this
intuition
exist
a
taking
possession
of
the
spirit
by
itself
is
possible
and
no
longer
only
a
knowledge
that
is
external
and
phenomenal
what
is
more
if
we
have
an
intuition
of
this
kind
i
mean
an
intuition
then
sensuous
intuition
is
likely
to
be
in
continuity
with
it
through
certain
intermediaries
as
the
is
continuous
with
the
sensuous
intuition
itself
therefore
is
promoted
it
will
no
longer
attain
only
the
phantom
of
an
unattainable
it
is
provided
we
bring
to
it
certain
indispensable
corrections
into
the
absolute
itself
that
it
will
introduce
us
so
long
as
it
was
regarded
as
the
only
material
of
our
science
it
reflected
back
on
all
science
something
of
the
relativity
which
strikes
a
scientific
knowledge
of
spirit
and
thus
the
perception
of
bodies
which
is
the
beginning
of
the
science
of
bodies
seemed
itself
to
be
relative
relative
therefore
seemed
to
be
sensuous
intuition
but
this
is
not
the
case
if
distinctions
are
made
between
the
different
sciences
and
if
the
scientific
knowledge
of
the
spiritual
and
also
consequently
of
the
vital
be
regarded
as
the
more
or
less
artificial
extension
of
a
certain
manner
of
knowing
which
applied
to
bodies
is
not
at
all
symbolical
let
us
go
further
if
there
are
thus
two
intuitions
of
different
order
the
second
being
obtained
by
a
reversal
of
the
direction
of
the
first
and
if
it
is
toward
the
second
that
the
intellect
naturally
inclines
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
the
intellect
and
this
intuition
itself
the
barriers
between
the
matter
of
sensible
knowledge
and
its
form
are
lowered
as
also
between
the
pure
forms
of
sensibility
and
the
categories
of
the
understanding
the
matter
and
form
of
intellectual
knowledge
restricted
to
its
own
object
are
seen
to
be
engendering
each
other
by
a
reciprocal
adaptation
intellect
modeling
itself
on
corporeity
and
corporeity
on
intellect
but
this
duality
of
intuition
kant
neither
would
nor
could
admit
it
would
have
been
necessary
in
order
to
admit
it
to
regard
duration
as
the
very
stuff
of
reality
and
consequently
to
distinguish
between
the
substantial
duration
of
things
and
time
spread
out
in
space
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
regard
space
itself
and
the
geometry
which
is
immanent
in
space
as
an
ideal
limit
in
the
direction
of
which
material
things
develop
but
which
they
do
not
actually
attain
nothing
could
be
more
contrary
to
the
letter
and
perhaps
also
to
the
spirit
of
the
of
pure
no
doubt
knowledge
is
presented
to
us
in
it
as
an
roll
experience
as
a
push
of
facts
that
is
for
ever
going
on
but
according
to
kant
these
facts
are
spread
out
on
one
plane
as
fast
as
they
arise
they
are
external
to
each
other
and
external
to
the
mind
of
a
knowledge
from
within
that
could
grasp
them
in
their
springing
forth
instead
of
taking
them
already
sprung
that
would
dig
beneath
space
and
spatialized
time
there
is
never
any
question
yet
it
is
indeed
beneath
this
plane
that
our
consciousness
places
us
there
flows
true
duration
in
this
respect
also
kant
is
very
near
his
predecessors
between
the
and
the
time
that
is
spread
out
in
distinct
moments
he
admits
no
mean
and
as
there
is
indeed
no
intuition
that
carries
us
into
the
all
intuition
is
thus
found
to
be
sensuous
by
definition
but
between
physical
existence
which
is
spread
out
in
space
and
existence
which
can
only
be
a
conceptual
and
logical
existence
like
that
of
which
metaphysical
dogmatism
speaks
is
there
not
room
for
consciousness
and
for
life
there
is
unquestionably
we
perceive
it
when
we
place
ourselves
in
duration
in
order
to
go
from
that
duration
to
moments
instead
of
starting
from
moments
in
order
to
bind
them
again
and
to
construct
duration
yet
it
was
to
a
intuition
that
the
immediate
successors
of
kant
turned
in
order
to
escape
from
the
kantian
relativism
certainly
the
ideas
of
becoming
of
progress
of
evolution
seem
to
occupy
a
large
place
in
their
philosophy
but
does
duration
really
play
a
part
in
it
real
duration
is
that
in
which
each
form
flows
out
of
previous
forms
while
adding
to
them
something
new
and
is
explained
by
them
as
much
as
it
explains
them
but
to
deduce
this
form
directly
from
one
complete
being
which
it
is
supposed
to
manifest
is
to
return
to
spinozism
it
is
like
leibniz
and
spinoza
to
deny
to
duration
all
efficient
action
the
philosophy
severe
as
it
may
have
been
on
the
mechanistic
theories
accepts
from
mechanism
the
idea
of
a
science
that
is
one
and
the
same
for
all
kinds
of
reality
and
it
is
nearer
to
mechanism
than
it
imagines
for
though
in
the
consideration
of
matter
of
life
and
of
thought
it
replaces
the
successive
degrees
of
complexity
that
mechanism
supposed
by
degrees
of
the
realization
of
an
idea
or
by
degrees
of
the
objectification
of
a
will
it
still
speaks
of
degrees
and
these
degrees
are
those
of
a
scale
which
being
traverses
in
a
single
direction
in
short
it
makes
out
the
same
articulations
in
nature
that
mechanism
does
of
mechanism
it
retains
the
whole
design
it
merely
gives
it
a
different
coloring
but
it
is
the
design
itself
or
at
least
one
half
of
the
design
that
needs
to
be
if
we
are
to
do
that
we
must
give
up
the
method
of
which
was
that
of
kant
successors
we
must
appeal
to
experience
an
experience
purified
or
in
other
words
released
where
necessary
from
the
molds
that
our
intellect
has
formed
in
the
degree
and
proportion
of
the
progress
of
our
action
on
things
an
experience
of
this
kind
is
not
a
experience
it
only
seeks
beyond
the
spatialized
time
in
which
we
believe
we
see
continual
rearrangements
between
the
parts
that
concrete
duration
in
which
a
radical
recasting
of
the
whole
is
always
going
on
it
follows
the
real
in
all
its
sinuosities
it
does
not
lead
us
like
the
method
of
construction
to
higher
and
higher
generalities
stories
of
a
magnificent
building
but
then
it
leaves
no
play
between
the
explanations
it
suggests
and
the
objects
it
has
to
explain
it
is
the
detail
of
the
real
and
no
longer
only
the
whole
in
a
lump
that
it
claims
to
illumine
that
the
thought
of
the
nineteenth
century
called
for
a
philosophy
of
this
kind
rescued
from
the
arbitrary
capable
of
coming
down
to
the
detail
of
particular
facts
is
unquestionable
unquestionably
also
it
felt
that
this
philosophy
ought
to
establish
itself
in
what
we
call
concrete
duration
the
advent
of
the
moral
sciences
the
progress
of
psychology
the
growing
importance
of
embryology
among
the
biological
sciences
all
this
was
bound
to
suggest
the
idea
of
a
reality
which
inwardly
which
is
duration
itself
so
when
a
philosopher
arose
who
announced
a
doctrine
of
evolution
in
which
the
progress
of
matter
toward
perceptibility
would
be
traced
together
with
the
advance
of
the
mind
toward
rationality
in
which
the
complication
of
correspondences
between
the
external
and
the
internal
would
be
followed
step
by
step
in
which
change
would
become
the
very
substance
of
things
to
him
all
eyes
were
turned
the
powerful
attraction
that
spencerian
evolutionism
has
exercised
on
contemporary
thought
is
due
to
that
very
cause
however
far
spencer
may
seem
to
be
from
kant
however
ignorant
indeed
he
may
have
been
of
kantianism
he
felt
nevertheless
at
his
first
contact
with
the
biological
sciences
the
direction
in
which
philosophy
could
continue
to
advance
without
laying
itself
open
to
the
kantian
criticism
but
he
had
no
sooner
started
to
follow
the
path
than
he
turned
off
short
he
had
promised
to
retrace
a
genesis
and
lo
he
was
doing
something
entirely
different
his
doctrine
bore
indeed
the
name
of
evolutionism
it
claimed
to
remount
and
redescend
the
course
of
the
universal
becoming
but
in
fact
it
dealt
neither
with
becoming
nor
with
evolution
we
need
not
enter
here
into
a
profound
examination
of
this
philosophy
let
us
say
merely
that
usual
device
of
the
spencerian
method
consists
in
reconstructing
evolution
with
fragments
of
the
if
i
paste
a
picture
on
a
card
and
then
cut
up
the
card
into
bits
i
can
reproduce
the
picture
by
rightly
grouping
again
the
small
pieces
and
a
child
who
working
thus
with
the
pieces
of
a
and
putting
together
unformed
fragments
of
the
picture
finally
obtains
a
pretty
colored
design
no
doubt
imagines
that
he
has
design
and
color
yet
the
act
of
drawing
and
painting
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
of
putting
together
the
fragments
of
a
picture
already
drawn
and
already
painted
so
by
combining
together
the
most
simple
results
of
evolution
you
may
imitate
well
or
ill
the
most
complex
effects
but
of
neither
the
simple
nor
the
complex
will
you
have
retraced
the
genesis
and
the
addition
of
evolved
to
evolved
will
bear
no
resemblance
whatever
to
the
movement
of
evolution
such
however
is
spencer
illusion
he
takes
reality
in
its
present
form
he
breaks
it
to
pieces
he
scatters
it
in
fragments
which
he
throws
to
the
winds
then
he
integrates
these
fragments
and
dissipates
their
movement
having
the
whole
by
a
work
of
mosaic
he
imagines
he
has
retraced
the
design
of
it
and
made
the
genesis
is
it
matter
that
is
in
question
the
diffused
elements
which
he
integrates
into
visible
and
tangible
bodies
have
all
the
air
of
being
the
very
particles
of
the
simple
bodies
which
he
first
supposes
disseminated
throughout
space
they
are
at
any
rate
material
points
and
consequently
unvarying
points
veritable
little
solids
as
if
solidity
being
what
is
nearest
and
handiest
to
us
could
be
found
at
the
very
origin
of
materiality
the
more
physics
progresses
the
more
it
shows
the
impossibility
of
representing
the
properties
of
ether
or
of
electricity
the
probable
base
of
all
bodies
on
the
model
of
the
properties
of
the
matter
which
we
perceive
but
philosophy
goes
back
further
even
than
the
ether
a
mere
schematic
figure
of
the
relations
between
phenomena
apprehended
by
our
senses
it
knows
indeed
that
what
is
visible
and
tangible
in
things
represents
our
possible
action
on
them
it
is
not
by
dividing
the
evolved
that
we
shall
reach
the
principle
of
that
which
evolves
it
is
not
by
recomposing
the
evolved
with
itself
that
we
shall
reproduce
the
evolution
of
which
it
is
the
term
is
it
the
question
of
mind
by
compounding
the
reflex
with
the
reflex
spencer
thinks
he
generates
instinct
and
rational
volition
one
after
the
other
he
fails
to
see
that
the
specialized
reflex
being
a
terminal
point
of
evolution
just
as
much
as
perfect
will
can
not
be
supposed
at
the
start
that
the
first
of
the
two
terms
should
have
reached
its
final
form
before
the
other
is
probable
enough
but
both
the
one
and
the
other
are
of
the
evolution
movement
and
the
evolution
movement
itself
can
no
more
be
expressed
as
a
function
solely
of
the
first
than
solely
of
the
second
we
must
begin
by
mixing
the
reflex
and
the
voluntary
we
must
then
go
in
quest
of
the
fluid
reality
which
has
been
precipitated
in
this
twofold
form
and
which
probably
shares
in
both
without
being
either
at
the
lowest
degree
of
the
animal
scale
in
living
beings
that
are
but
an
undifferentiated
protoplasmic
mass
the
reaction
to
stimulus
does
not
yet
call
into
play
one
definite
mechanism
as
in
the
reflex
it
has
not
yet
choice
among
several
definite
mechanisms
as
in
the
voluntary
act
it
is
then
neither
voluntary
nor
reflex
though
it
heralds
both
we
experience
in
ourselves
something
of
this
true
original
activity
when
we
perform
and
movements
to
escape
a
pressing
danger
and
yet
this
is
but
a
very
imperfect
imitation
of
the
primitive
character
for
we
are
concerned
here
with
a
mixture
of
two
activities
already
formed
already
localized
in
a
brain
and
in
a
spinal
cord
whereas
the
original
activity
was
a
simple
thing
which
became
diversified
through
the
very
construction
of
mechanisms
like
those
of
the
spinal
cord
and
brain
but
to
all
this
spencer
shuts
his
eyes
because
it
is
of
the
essence
of
his
method
to
recompose
the
consolidated
with
the
consolidated
instead
of
going
back
to
the
gradual
process
of
consolidation
which
is
evolution
itself
is
it
finally
the
question
of
the
correspondence
between
mind
and
matter
spencer
is
right
in
defining
the
intellect
by
this
correspondence
he
is
right
in
regarding
it
as
the
end
of
an
evolution
but
when
he
comes
to
retrace
this
evolution
again
he
integrates
the
evolved
with
the
evolved
failing
to
see
that
he
is
thus
taking
useless
trouble
and
that
in
positing
the
slightest
fragment
of
the
actually
evolved
he
posits
the
whole
so
that
it
is
vain
for
him
then
to
pretend
to
make
the
genesis
of
it
for
according
to
him
the
phenomena
that
succeed
each
other
in
nature
project
into
the
human
mind
images
which
represent
them
to
the
relations
between
phenomena
therefore
correspond
symmetrically
relations
between
the
ideas
and
the
most
general
laws
of
nature
in
which
the
relations
between
phenomena
are
condensed
are
thus
found
to
have
engendered
the
directing
principles
of
thought
into
which
the
relations
between
ideas
have
been
integrated
nature
therefore
is
reflected
in
mind
the
intimate
structure
of
our
thought
corresponds
piece
by
piece
to
the
very
skeleton
of
things
i
admit
it
willingly
but
in
order
that
the
human
mind
may
be
able
to
represent
relations
between
phenomena
there
must
first
be
phenomena
that
is
to
say
distinct
facts
cut
out
in
the
continuity
of
becoming
and
once
we
posit
this
particular
mode
of
cutting
up
such
as
we
perceive
it
we
posit
also
the
intellect
such
as
it
is
for
it
is
by
relation
to
it
and
to
it
alone
that
reality
is
cut
up
in
this
manner
is
it
probable
that
mammals
and
insects
notice
the
same
aspects
of
nature
trace
in
it
the
same
divisions
articulate
the
whole
in
the
same
way
and
yet
the
insect
so
far
as
intelligent
has
already
something
of
our
intellect
each
being
cuts
up
the
material
world
according
to
the
lines
that
its
action
must
follow
it
is
these
lines
of
that
by
intercrossing
mark
out
the
net
of
experience
of
which
each
mesh
is
a
fact
no
doubt
a
town
is
composed
exclusively
of
houses
and
the
streets
of
the
town
are
only
the
intervals
between
the
houses
so
we
may
say
that
nature
contains
only
facts
and
that
the
facts
once
posited
the
relations
are
simply
the
lines
running
between
the
facts
but
in
a
town
it
is
the
gradual
portioning
of
the
ground
into
lots
that
has
determined
at
once
the
place
of
the
houses
their
general
shape
and
the
direction
of
the
streets
to
this
portioning
we
must
go
back
if
we
wish
to
understand
the
particular
mode
of
subdivision
that
causes
each
house
to
be
where
it
is
each
street
to
run
as
it
does
now
the
cardinal
error
of
spencer
is
to
take
experience
already
allotted
as
given
whereas
the
true
problem
is
to
know
how
the
allotment
was
worked
i
agree
that
the
laws
of
thought
are
only
the
integration
of
relations
between
facts
but
when
i
posit
the
facts
with
the
shape
they
have
for
me
i
suppose
my
faculties
of
perception
and
intellection
such
as
they
are
in
me
for
it
is
they
that
portion
the
real
into
lots
they
that
cut
the
facts
out
in
the
whole
of
reality
therefore
instead
of
saying
that
the
relations
between
facts
have
generated
the
laws
of
thought
i
can
as
well
claim
that
it
is
the
form
of
thought
that
has
determined
the
shape
of
the
facts
perceived
and
consequently
their
relations
among
themselves
the
two
ways
of
expressing
oneself
are
equivalent
they
say
at
bottom
the
same
thing
with
the
second
it
is
true
we
give
up
speaking
of
evolution
but
with
the
first
we
only
speak
of
it
we
do
not
think
of
it
any
the
more
for
a
true
evolutionism
would
propose
to
discover
by
what
gradually
obtained
the
intellect
has
adopted
its
plan
of
structure
and
matter
its
mode
of
subdivision
this
structure
and
this
subdivision
work
into
each
other
they
are
mutually
complementary
they
must
have
progressed
one
with
the
other
and
whether
we
posit
the
present
structure
of
mind
or
the
present
subdivision
of
matter
in
either
case
we
remain
in
the
evolved
we
are
told
nothing
of
what
evolves
nothing
of
evolution
and
yet
it
is
this
evolution
that
we
must
discover
already
in
the
field
of
physics
itself
the
scientists
who
are
pushing
the
study
of
their
science
furthest
incline
to
believe
that
we
can
not
reason
about
the
parts
as
we
reason
about
the
whole
that
the
same
principles
are
not
applicable
to
the
origin
and
to
the
end
of
a
progress
that
neither
creation
nor
annihilation
for
instance
is
inadmissible
when
we
are
concerned
with
the
constituent
corpuscles
of
the
atom
thereby
they
tend
to
place
themselves
in
the
concrete
duration
in
which
alone
there
is
true
generation
and
not
only
a
composition
of
parts
it
is
true
that
the
creation
and
annihilation
of
which
they
speak
concern
the
movement
or
the
energy
and
not
the
imponderable
medium
through
which
the
energy
and
the
movement
are
supposed
to
circulate
but
what
can
remain
of
matter
when
you
take
away
everything
that
determines
it
that
is
to
say
just
energy
and
movement
themselves
the
philosopher
must
go
further
than
the
scientist
making
a
clean
sweep
of
everything
that
is
only
an
imaginative
symbol
he
will
see
the
material
world
melt
back
into
a
simple
flux
a
continuity
of
flowing
a
becoming
and
he
will
thus
be
prepared
to
discover
real
duration
there
where
it
is
still
more
useful
to
find
it
in
the
realm
of
life
and
of
consciousness
for
so
far
as
inert
matter
is
concerned
we
may
neglect
the
flowing
without
committing
a
serious
error
matter
we
have
said
is
weighted
with
geometry
and
matter
the
reality
which
endures
only
by
its
connection
with
that
which
but
life
and
consciousness
are
this
very
ascension
when
once
we
have
grasped
them
in
their
essence
by
adopting
their
movement
we
understand
how
the
rest
of
reality
is
derived
from
them
evolution
appears
and
within
this
evolution
the
progressive
determination
of
materiality
and
intellectuality
by
the
gradual
consolidation
of
the
one
and
of
the
other
but
then
it
is
within
the
evolutionary
movement
that
we
place
ourselves
in
order
to
follow
it
to
its
present
results
instead
of
recomposing
these
results
artificially
with
fragments
of
themselves
such
seems
to
us
to
be
the
true
function
of
philosophy
so
understood
philosophy
is
not
only
the
turning
of
the
mind
homeward
the
coincidence
of
human
consciousness
with
the
living
principle
whence
it
emanates
a
contact
with
the
creative
effort
it
is
the
study
of
becoming
in
general
it
is
true
evolutionism
and
consequently
the
true
continuation
of
science
provided
that
we
understand
by
this
word
a
set
of
truths
either
experienced
or
demonstrated
and
not
a
certain
new
scholasticism
that
has
grown
up
during
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
around
the
physics
of
galileo
as
the
old
scholasticism
grew
up
around
