chapter

an
old
house
a
few
steps
from
the
charles
hotel
in
new
orleans
brings
you
to
and
across
canal
street
the
central
avenue
of
the
city
and
to
that
corner
where
the
sit
at
the
inner
and
outer
edges
of
the
arcaded
sidewalk
and
make
the
air
sweet
with
their
fragrant
merchandise
the
crowd
and
if
it
is
near
the
time
of
the
carnival
it
will
be
great
will
follow
canal
street
but
you
turn
instead
into
the
quiet
narrow
way
which
a
lover
of
creole
antiquity
in
fondness
for
a
romantic
past
is
still
prone
to
call
the
rue
royale
you
will
pass
a
few
restaurants
a
few
auction
rooms
a
few
furniture
warehouses
and
will
hardly
realize
that
you
have
left
behind
you
the
activity
and
clatter
of
a
city
of
merchants
before
you
find
yourself
in
a
region
of
architectural
decrepitude
where
an
ancient
and
domestic
life
in
second
stories
overhangs
the
ruins
of
a
former
commercial
prosperity
and
upon
everything
has
settled
down
a
long
sabbath
of
decay
the
vehicles
in
the
street
are
few
in
number
and
are
merely
passing
through
the
stores
are
shrunken
into
shops
you
see
here
and
there
like
a
patch
of
bright
mould
the
stall
of
that
significant
fungus
the
chinaman
many
great
doors
are
shut
and
clamped
and
grown
gray
with
cobweb
many
street
windows
are
nailed
up
half
the
balconies
are
begrimed
and
and
many
of
the
humid
arches
and
alleys
which
characterize
the
older
piles
of
stuccoed
brick
betray
a
squalor
almost
oriental
yet
beauty
lingers
here
to
say
nothing
of
the
picturesque
sometimes
you
get
sight
of
comfort
sometimes
of
opulence
through
the
unlatched
wicket
in
some
brick
pavement
foliage
of
dark
palm
or
pale
banana
marble
or
granite
masonry
and
blooming
parterres
or
through
a
chink
between
some
pair
of
heavy
batten
opened
with
an
almost
reptile
wariness
your
eye
gets
a
glimpse
of
lace
and
brocade
upholstery
silver
and
bronze
and
much
similar
rich
antiquity
the
faces
of
the
inmates
are
in
keeping
of
the
passengers
in
the
street
a
sad
proportion
are
dingy
and
shabby
but
just
when
these
are
putting
you
off
your
guard
there
will
pass
you
a
woman
more
likely
two
or
three
of
patrician
beauty
now
if
you
will
go
far
enough
down
this
old
street
you
will
see
as
you
approach
its
intersection
with
names
in
that
region
elude
one
like
ghosts
however
as
you
begin
to
find
the
way
a
trifle
more
open
you
will
not
fail
to
notice
on
the
side
about
midway
of
the
square
a
small
low
brick
house
of
a
story
and
a
half
set
out
upon
the
sidewalk
as
and
mute
as
an
aged
beggar
fallen
asleep
its
corrugated
roof
of
dull
red
tiles
sloping
down
toward
you
with
an
inward
curve
is
overgrown
with
weeds
and
in
the
fall
of
the
year
is
gay
with
the
yellow
plumes
of
the
you
can
almost
touch
with
your
cane
the
low
edge
of
the
broad
overhanging
eaves
the
batten
shutters
at
door
and
window
with
hinges
like
those
of
a
postern
are
shut
with
a
grip
that
makes
one
knuckles
and
nails
feel
lacerated
save
in
the
itself
there
is
not
a
cranny
you
would
say
the
house
has
the
there
are
two
doors
and
to
each
a
single
chipped
and
battered
marble
step
continuing
on
down
the
sidewalk
on
a
line
with
the
house
is
a
garden
masked
from
view
by
a
high
close
you
may
see
the
tops
of
its
pomegranate
peach
banana
fig
pear
and
particularly
one
large
orange
close
by
the
fence
that
must
be
very
old
the
residents
over
the
narrow
way
who
live
in
a
house
originally
of
much
pretension
but
from
whose
front
door
hard
times
have
removed
almost
all
vestiges
of
paint
will
tell
you
yass
de
is
is
live
in
and
this
is
likely
to
be
all
the
information
you
get
not
that
they
would
not
tell
but
they
can
not
grasp
the
idea
that
you
wish
to
know
until
possibly
just
as
you
are
turning
to
depart
your
informant
in
a
single
word
and
with
the
most
evident
of
its
value
drops
the
simple
key
to
the
whole
matter
dey
quadroons
he
may
then
be
aroused
to
mention
the
better
appearance
of
the
place
in
former
years
when
the
houses
of
this
region
generally
stood
farther
apart
and
that
garden
comprised
the
whole
square
here
dwelt
sixty
years
ago
and
more
one
delphine
carraze
or
as
she
was
commonly
designated
by
the
few
who
knew
her
madame
delphine
that
she
owned
her
home
and
that
it
had
been
given
her
by
the
then
deceased
companion
of
her
days
of
beauty
were
facts
so
generally
admitted
as
to
be
even
as
far
back
as
that
sixty
years
ago
no
longer
a
subject
of
gossip
she
was
never
pointed
out
by
the
denizens
of
the
quarter
as
a
character
nor
her
house
as
a
feature
it
would
have
passed
all
creole
powers
of
guessing
to
divine
what
you
could
find
worthy
of
inquiry
concerning
a
retired
quadroon
woman
and
not
the
least
puzzled
of
all
would
have
been
the
timid
and
restive
madame
delphine
herself
chapter
ii
madame
delphine
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
present
century
the
free
quadroon
caste
of
new
orleans
was
in
its
golden
age
earlier
generations
sprung
upon
the
one
hand
from
the
merry
gallants
of
a
french
colonial
military
service
which
had
grown
gross
by
affiliation
with
frontier
life
and
upon
the
other
hand
from
comely
ethiopians
culled
out
of
the
less
negroidal
types
of
african
live
goods
and
bought
at
the
ship
side
with
vestiges
of
quills
and
cowries
and
copper
wire
still
in
their
these
earlier
generations
with
scars
of
battle
or
private
rencontre
still
on
the
fathers
and
of
servitude
on
the
manumitted
mothers
afforded
a
mere
hint
of
the
splendor
that
was
to
result
from
a
survival
of
the
fairest
through
years
devoted
to
the
elimination
of
the
black
pigment
and
the
cultivation
of
hyperian
excellence
and
nymphean
grace
and
beauty
nor
if
we
turn
to
the
present
is
the
evidence
much
stronger
which
is
offered
by
the
de
whom
you
may
see
in
the
quadroon
quarter
this
afternoon
with
ichabod
legible
on
their
murky
foreheads
through
a
vain
smearing
of
toilet
powder
dragging
their
chairs
down
to
the
narrow
of
their
gardens
and
staring
shrinkingly
at
you
as
you
pass
like
a
nest
of
yellow
kittens
but
as
the
present
century
was
in
its
second
and
third
decades
the
for
we
must
contrive
a
feminine
spelling
to
define
the
strict
limits
of
the
caste
as
then
established
came
forth
in
splendor
old
travellers
spare
no
terms
to
tell
their
praises
their
faultlessness
of
feature
their
perfection
of
form
their
varied
styles
of
beauty
for
there
were
even
pure
caucasian
blondes
among
them
their
fascinating
manners
their
sparkling
vivacity
their
chaste
and
pretty
wit
their
grace
in
the
dance
their
modest
propriety
their
taste
and
elegance
in
dress
in
the
gentlest
and
most
poetic
sense
they
were
indeed
the
sirens
of
this
land
where
it
seemed
always
afternoon
a
momentary
triumph
of
an
arcadian
over
a
christian
civilization
so
beautiful
and
so
seductive
that
it
became
the
subject
of
special
chapters
by
writers
of
the
day
more
original
than
correct
as
social
philosophers
the
balls
that
were
got
up
for
them
by
the
male
were
to
that
day
what
the
carnival
is
to
the
present
society
balls
given
the
same
nights
proved
failures
through
the
coincidence
the
magnates
of
government
municipal
state
federal
those
of
the
army
of
the
learned
professions
and
of
the
clubs
in
short
the
white
male
aristocracy
in
everything
save
the
ecclesiastical
desk
were
there
tickets
were
to
insure
the
exclusion
of
the
vulgar
no
distinguished
stranger
was
allowed
to
miss
them
they
were
beautiful
they
were
clad
in
silken
extenuations
from
the
throat
to
the
feet
and
wore
withal
a
pathos
in
their
charm
that
gave
them
a
family
likeness
to
innocence
madame
delphine
were
you
not
a
stranger
could
have
told
you
all
about
it
though
hardly
i
suppose
without
tears
but
at
the
time
of
which
we
would
speak
her
day
of
splendor
was
set
and
her
husband
let
us
call
him
so
for
her
sake
was
long
dead
he
was
an
american
and
if
we
take
her
word
for
it
a
man
of
noble
heart
and
extremely
handsome
but
this
is
knowledge
which
we
can
do
without
even
in
those
days
the
house
was
always
shut
and
madame
chief
occupation
and
end
in
life
seemed
to
be
to
keep
well
locked
up
she
was
an
excellent
person
the
neighbors
said
a
very
worthy
person
and
they
were
may
be
nearer
correct
than
they
knew
they
rarely
saw
her
save
when
she
went
to
or
returned
from
church
a
small
rather
dark
quadroone
of
very
good
features
and
a
gentle
thoughtfulness
of
expression
which
it
would
take
long
to
describe
call
it
a
widow
look
in
speaking
of
madame
delphine
house
mention
should
have
been
made
of
a
gate
in
the
fence
on
the
sidewalk
it
is
gone
now
and
was
out
of
use
then
being
fastened
once
for
all
by
an
iron
staple
clasping
the
and
driven
into
the
post
which
leads
us
to
speak
of
another
person
chapter
iii
capitaine
lemaitre
he
was
one
of
those
men
that
might
be
any
age
thirty
forty
there
was
no
telling
from
his
face
what
was
years
and
what
was
only
weather
his
countenance
was
of
a
grave
and
quiet
but
also
luminous
sort
which
was
instantly
admired
and
ever
afterward
remembered
as
was
also
the
fineness
of
his
hair
and
the
blueness
of
his
eyes
those
pronounced
him
youngest
who
scrutinized
his
face
the
closest
but
waiving
the
discussion
of
age
he
was
odd
though
not
with
the
oddness
that
he
who
reared
him
had
striven
to
produce
he
had
not
been
brought
up
by
mother
or
father
he
had
lost
both
in
infancy
and
had
fallen
to
the
care
of
a
rugged
old
military
grandpa
of
the
colonial
school
whose
unceasing
endeavor
had
been
to
make
his
boy
as
savage
and
ferocious
a
holder
of
unimpeachable
social
rank
as
it
became
a
french
creole
to
be
who
could
trace
his
pedigree
back
to
the
god
mars
remember
my
boy
was
the
adjuration
received
by
him
as
regularly
as
his
waking
cup
of
black
coffee
that
none
of
your
family
line
ever
kept
the
laws
of
any
government
or
creed
and
if
it
was
well
that
he
should
bear
this
in
mind
it
was
well
to
reiterate
it
persistently
for
from
the
nurse
arms
the
boy
wore
a
look
not
of
docility
so
much
as
of
gentle
benevolence
the
domestics
of
the
old
man
house
used
to
shed
tears
of
laughter
to
see
that
look
on
the
face
of
a
babe
his
rude
guardian
addressed
himself
to
the
modification
of
this
facial
expression
it
had
not
enough
of
majesty
in
it
for
instance
or
of
large
but
with
care
these
could
be
made
to
come
and
true
enough
at
in
ursin
lemaitre
the
labors
of
his
grandfather
were
an
apparent
success
he
was
not
rugged
nor
was
he
as
his
venerable
trainer
would
have
liked
to
present
him
to
society
but
he
was
as
serenely
terrible
as
a
rifle
and
the
old
man
looked
upon
his
results
with
pride
he
had
cultivated
him
up
to
that
pitch
where
he
scorned
to
practice
any
vice
or
any
virtue
that
did
not
include
the
principle
of
a
few
touches
only
were
wanting
here
and
there
to
achieve
perfection
when
suddenly
the
old
man
died
yet
it
was
his
proud
satisfaction
before
he
finally
lay
down
to
see
ursin
a
favored
companion
and
the
peer
both
in
courtesy
and
pride
of
those
polished
gentlemen
famous
in
history
the
brothers
lafitte
the
two
lafittes
were
at
the
time
young
lemaitre
reached
his
majority
say
or
only
merchant
blacksmiths
so
to
speak
a
term
intended
to
convey
the
idea
of
blacksmiths
who
never
soiled
their
hands
who
were
men
of
capital
stood
a
little
higher
than
the
clergy
and
moved
in
society
among
its
autocrats
but
they
were
full
of
possibilities
men
of
action
and
men
too
of
thought
with
already
a
pronounced
disbelief
in
the
in
these
days
of
big
carnivals
they
would
have
been
patented
as
the
dukes
of
little
manchac
and
barataria
young
ursin
lemaitre
in
full
the
name
was
had
not
only
the
hearty
friendship
of
these
good
people
but
also
a
natural
turn
for
accounts
and
as
his
two
friends
were
looking
about
them
with
an
enterprising
eye
it
easily
resulted
that
he
presently
connected
himself
with
the
blacksmithing
profession
not
exactly
at
the
forge
in
the
lafittes
famous
smithy
among
the
african
samsons
who
with
their
shining
black
bodies
bared
to
the
waist
made
the
rue

with
the
stroke
of
their
hammers
but
as

the
word

those
days

where
was
the
difference
beyond
the
ken
of
a
community
to
which
the
enforcement
of
the
revenue
laws
had
long
been
merely
so
much
out

and

at
this
date

had
come
under
a
kinder
yoke
and
to
a
treasury
that
at
least
echoed
when
the
customs
were
dropped
into
it
but
the
change
was
still
new
what
could
a
man
be
more
than
capitaine
lemaitre
was
the

of
honor
the
pink
of
courtesy

the
courage
of
the
lion
and
the
magnanimity
of

paper
was
good
in

street
to
the
gossips
in
the
he
was
the
culminating
proof
that
smuggling
was
one
of
the
sublimer
virtues
years
went
by
events
transpired
which
have
their
place
in
history
under
a
government
which
the
community
by
and
by
saw
was
conducted
in
their
interest
smuggling
began
to
lose
its
respectability
and
to
grow
disreputable
hazardous
and
debased
in
certain
onslaughts
made
upon
them
by
officers
of
the
law
some
of
the
smugglers
became
murderers
the
business
became
unprofitable
for
a
time
until
the
enterprising
lafittes
thinkers
bethought
them
of
a
corrective
privateering
thereupon
the
united
states
government
set
a
price
upon
their
heads
later
yet
it
became
known
that
these
outlawed
pirates
had
been
offered
money
and
rank
by
great
britain
if
they
would
join
her
standard
then
hovering
about
the
to
their
native
city
and
that
they
had
spurned
the
bribe
wherefore
their
heads
were
ruled
out
of
the
market
and
meeting
and
treating
with
andrew
jackson
they
were
received
as
lovers
of
their
country
and
as
compatriots
fought
in
the
battle
of
new
orleans
at
the
head
of
their
fearless
men
and

up

the

and

in

was
a

fondly
known
among
his

as
p√®re

he
was
a
creole
and
a
member
of
one
of

his
dwelling
was
a

standing
on

just
inside
a

close
fence

reached
by

stair

was
well
surrounded
by
crape
myrtles
and
communicated
behind
by
a
descending
stair
and
a
with
the
rear
entrance
of
the
chapel
over
whose
worshippers
he
daily
spread
his
hands
in
benediction
the
name
of
the
street
ah
there
is
where
light
is
wanting
save
the
cathedral
and
the
ursulines
there
is
very
little
of
record
concerning
churches
at
that
time
though
they
were
springing
up
here
and
there
all
there
is
certainty
of
is
that
p√®re
jerome
frame
chapel
was
some
little
thing
that
may
have
survived
the
passage
of
years
or
may
have
escaped
paxton
directory
so
as
by
fire
his
parlor
was
dingy
and
carpetless
one
could
smell
distinctly
there
the
vow
of
poverty
his
bedchamber
was
bare
and
clean
and
the
bed
in
it
narrow
and
hard
but
between
the
two
was
a
that
would
tempt
a
laugh
to
the
lips
of
any
who
looked
in
the
table
was
small
but
stout
and
all
the
furniture
of
the
room
substantial
made
of
fine
wood
and
carved
just
enough
to
give
the
notion
of
wrinkling
pleasantry
his
mother
and
sister
doing
p√®re
jerome
would
explain
they
would
not
permit
this
apartment
or
department
to
suffer
therein
as
well
as
in
the
parlor
there
was
odor
but
of
a
more
epicurean
sort
that
explained
interestingly
the
p√®re
jerome
rotundity
and
rosy
smile
in
this
room
and
about
this
miniature
round
table
used
sometimes
to
sit
with
p√®re
jerome
two
friends
to
whom
he
was
deeply
attached
one
evariste
varrillat
a
playmate
from
early
childhood
now
his
the
other
jean
thompson
a
companion
from
youngest
manhood
and
both
like
the
little
priest
himself
the
regretful
rememberers
of
a
fourth
comrade
who
was
a
comrade
no
more
like
p√®re
jerome
they
had
come
through
years
to
the
thick
of
conflicts
the
priest
a
physician
the
other
an
attorney
and
to
the
lonely
wanderer
yet
they
loved
to
huddle
around
this
small
board
and
be
boys
again
in
heart
while
men
in
mind
neither
one
nor
another
was
leader
in
earlier
days
they
had
always
yielded
to
him
who
no
longer
met
with
them
a
certain
chieftainship
and
they
still
thought
of
him
and
talked
of
him
and
in
their
conjectures
groped
after
him
as
one
of
whom
they
continued
to
expect
greater
things
than
of
themselves
they
sat
one
day
drawn
thus
close
together
sipping
and
theorizing
speculating
upon
the
nature
of
things
in
an
easy
bold
sophomoric
way
the
conversation
for
the
most
part
being
in
french
the
native
tongue
of
the
doctor
and
priest
and
spoken
with
facility
by
jean
thompson
the
lawyer
who
was
half
am√©ricain
but
running
sometimes
into
english
and
sometimes
into
mild
laughter
mention
had
been
made
of
the
absentee
p√®re
jerome
advanced
an
idea
something
like
this
it
is
impossible
for
any
finite
mind
to
fix
the
degree
of
criminality
of
any
human
act
or
of
any
human
life
the
infinite
one
alone
can
know
how
much
of
our
sin
is
chargeable
to
us
and
how
much
to
our
brothers
or
our
fathers
we
all
participate
in
one
another
sins
there
is
a
community
of
responsibility
attaching
to
every
misdeed
no
human
since
adam
nay
nor
adam
himself
ever
sinned
entirely
to
himself
and
so
i
never
am
called
upon
to
contemplate
a
crime
or
a
criminal
but
i
feel
my
conscience
pointing
at
me
as
one
of
the
accessories
in
a
word
said
evariste
varrillat
the
physician
you
think
we
are
partly
to
blame
for
the
omission
of
many
of
your
paternosters
eh
father
jerome
smiled
no
a
man
can
not
plead
so
in
his
own
defense
our
first
father
tried
that
but
the
plea
was
not
allowed
but
now
there
is
our
absent
friend
i
tell
you
truly
this
whole
community
ought
to
be
recognized
as
partners
in
his
moral
errors
among
another
people
reared
under
wiser
care
and
with
better
companions
how
different
might
he
not
have
been
how
can
speak
of
him
as
a
who
might
have
saved
him
from
that
name
here
the
speaker
turned
to
jean
thompson
and
changed
his
speech
to
english
a
lady
sez
to
me
jerome
dat
is
a
dreadfool
dat
gone
at
de
coas
of
cuba
to
be
one
corsair
aint
it
madame
i
sez
a
terrible
de
good
god
will
me
an
you
fo
dat
jean
thompson
answered
quickly
you
should
not
have
let
her
say
that
fo
why
because
if
you
are
partly
responsible
you
ought
so
much
the
more
to
do
what
you
can
to
shield
his
reputation
you
should
have
said
the
attorney
changed
to
french
is
no
pirate
he
has
merely
taken
out
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
under
the
flag
of
the
republic
of
carthagena
exclaimed
doctor
varrillat
and
both
he
and
his
the
priest
laughed
why
not
demanded
thompson
oh
said
the
physician
with
a
shrug
say
id
thad
way
iv
you
wand
then
suddenly
becoming
serious
he
was
about
to
add
something
else
when
p√®re
jerome
spoke
i
will
tell
you
what
i
could
have
said
i
could
have
said
yes
is
a
terrible
fo
him
he
in
de
dark
but
dat
good
god
will
mek
it
a
fo
dat
man
oohever
he
is
put
light
out
but
how
do
you
know
he
is
a
pirate
demanded
thompson
aggressively
how
do
we
know
said
the
little
priest
returning
to
french
ah
there
is
no
other
explanation
of
the
stories
that
come
to
us
from
every
port
where
ships
arrive
from
the
north
coast
of
cuba
of
a
commander
of
pirates
there
who
is
a
marvel
of
courtesy
and
gentility
gazettes
of
the
period
and
whose
name
is
lafitte
said
the
obstinate
attorney
and
who
nevertheless
is
not
lafitte
insisted
p√®re
jerome
daz
troo
jean
said
doctor
varrillat
we
hall
know
daz
troo
p√®re
jerome
leaned
forward
over
the
board
and
spoke
with
an
air
of
secrecy
in
french
you
have
heard
of
the
ship
which
came
into
port
here
last
monday
you
have
heard
that
she
was
boarded
by
pirates
and
that
the
captain
of
the
ship
himself
drove
them
off
an
incredible
story
said
thompson
but
not
so
incredible
as
the
truth
i
have
it
from
a
passenger
there
was
on
the
ship
a
young
girl
who
was
very
beautiful
she
came
on
deck
where
the
corsair
stood
about
to
issue
his
orders
and
more
beautiful
than
ever
in
the
desperation
of
the
moment
confronted
him
with
a
small
missal
spread
open
and
her
finger
on
the
apostles
creed
commanded
him
to
read
he
read
it
uncovering
his
head
as
he
read
then
stood
gazing
on
her
face
which
did
not
quail
and
then
with
a
low
bow
said
me
this
book
and
i
will
do
your
bidding
she
gave
him
the
book
and
bade
him
leave
the
ship
and
he
left
it
unmolested
p√®re
jerome
looked
from
the
physician
to
the
attorney
and
back
again
once
or
twice
with
his
dimpled
smile
but
he
speaks
english
they
say
said
jean
thompson
he
has
no
doubt
learned
it
since
he
left
us
said
the
priest
but
this
too
says
his
men
called
him
lafitte
lafitte
no

the
two

looked
at

with

on

and
presently
broke
into
a
laugh

the

p√®re
jerome
sat
up
late
that
night
writing
a
letter
the
remarkable
effects
upon
a
certain
mind
effects
which
we
shall
presently
find
him
attributing
solely
to
the
influences
of
surrounding
nature
may
find
for
some
a
more
sufficient
explanation
in
the
fact
that
this
letter
was
but
one
of
a
series
and
that
in
the
rover
of
doubted
identity
and
incredible
eccentricity
p√®re
jerome
had
a
regular
correspondent
chapter
the
cap
fits
about
two
months
after
the
conversation
just
given
and
therefore
somewhere
about
the
christmas
holidays
of
the
year
p√®re
jerome
delighted
the
congregation
of
his
little
chapel
with
the
announcement
that
he
had
appointed
to
preach
a
sermon
in
french
on
the
following
sabbath
not
there
but
in
the
cathedral
he
was
much
beloved
notwithstanding
that
among
the
clergy
there
were
two
or
three
who
shook
their
heads
and
raised
their
eyebrows
and
said
he
would
be
at
least
as
orthodox
if
he
did
not
make
quite
so
much
of
the
bible
and
quite
so
little
of
the
dogmas
yet
the
common
people
heard
him
gladly
when
told
one
day
of
the
unfavorable
whispers
he
smiled
a
little
and
answered
his
informant
whom
he
knew
to
be
one
of
the
whisperers
himself
laying
a
hand
kindly
upon
his
shoulder
father
murphy
or
whatever
the
name
was
your
words
comfort
me
how
is
that
because
quum
benedixerint
mihi
woe
unto
me
when
all
men
speak
well
of
me
the
appointed
morning
when
it
came
was
one
of
those
exquisite
days
in
which
there
is
such
a
universal
harmony
that
worship
rises
from
the
heart
like
a
spring
truly
said
p√®re
jerome
to
the
companion
who
was
to
assist
him
in
the
mass
this
is
a
sabbath
day
which
we
do
not
have
to
make
holy
but
only
to
so
may
be
it
was
one
of
the
secrets
of
p√®re
jerome
success
as
a
preacher
that
he
took
more
thought
as
to
how
he
should
feel
than
as
to
what
he
should
say
the
cathedral
of
those
days
was
called
a
very
plain
old
pile
boasting
neither
beauty
nor
riches
but
to
p√®re
jerome
it
was
very
lovely
and
before
its
homely
altar
not
homely
to
him
in
the
performance
of
those
solemn
offices
symbols
of
heaven
mightiest
truths
in
the
hearing
of
the
organ
harmonies
and
the
yet
more
eloquent
interunion
of
human
voices
in
the
choir
in
overlooking
the
worshipping
throng
which
knelt
under
the
soft
chromatic
lights
and
in
breathing
the
sacrificial
odors
of
the
chancel
he
found
a
deep
and
solemn
joy
and
yet
i
guess
the
finest
thought
of
his
soul
the
while
was
one
that
came
thrice
and
again
be
not
deceived
p√®re
jerome
because
saintliness
of
feeling
is
easy
here
you
are
the
same
priest
who
overslept
this
morning
and
overate
yesterday
and
will
in
some
way
easily
go
wrong
and
the
day
after
he
took
it
with
him
when
the
sung
he
went
into
the
pulpit
of
the
sermon
he
preached
tradition
has
preserved
for
us
only
a
few
brief
sayings
but
they
are
strong
and
sweet
my
friends
he
said
this
was
near
the
beginning
the
angry
words
of
god
book
are
very
merciful
they
are
meant
to
drive
us
home
but
the
tender
words
my
friends
they
are
sometimes
terrible
notice
these
the
tenderest
words
of
the
tenderest
prayer
that
ever
came
from
the
lips
of
a
blessed
martyr
the
dying
words
of
the
holy
saint
stephen
lay
not
this
sin
to
their
charge
is
there
nothing
dreadful
in
that
read
it
thus
lay
not
this
sin
to
charge
not
to
the
charge
of
them
who
stoned
him
to
whose
charge
then
go
ask
the
holy
saint
paul
three
years
afterward
praying
in
the
temple
at
jerusalem
he
answered
that
question
stood
by
and
consented
he
answered
for
himself
only
but
the
day
must
come
when
all
that
wicked
council
that
sent
saint
stephen
away
to
be
stoned
and
all
that
city
of
jerusalem
must
hold
up
the
hand
and
say
also
lord
we
stood
by
ah
friends
under
the
simpler
meaning
of
that
dying
saint
prayer
for
the
pardon
of
his
murderers
is
hidden
the
terrible
truth
that
we
all
have
a
share
in
one
another
sins
thus
p√®re
jerome
touched
his
all
that
time
has
spared
us
beside
may
be
given
in
a
few
sentences
ah
he
cried
once
if
it
were
merely
my
own
sins
that
i
had
to
answer
for
i
might
hold
up
my
head
before
the
rest
of
mankind
but
no
no
my
friends
we
can
not
look
each
other
in
the
face
for
each
has
helped
the
other
to
sin
oh
where
is
there
any
room
in
this
world
of
common
disgrace
for
pride
even
if
we
had
no
common
hope
a
common
despair
ought
to
bind
us
together
and
forever
silence
the
voice
of
scorn
and
again
this
even
in
the
promise
to
no√´
not
again
to
destroy
the
race
with
a
flood
there
is
a
whisper
of
solemn
warning
the
moral
account
of
the
antediluvians
was
closed
off
and
the
balance
brought
down
in
the
year
of
the
deluge
but
the
account
of
those
who
come
after
runs
on
and
on
and
the
blessed
bow
of
promise
itself
warns
us
that
god
will
not
stop
it
till
the
judgment
day
o
god
i
thank
thee
that
that
day
must
come
at
last
when
thou
wilt
destroy
the
world
and
stop
the
interest
on
my
account
it
was
about
at
this
point
that
p√®re
jerome
noticed
more
particularly
than
he
had
done
before
sitting
among
the
worshippers
near
him
a
small
woman
of
pleasing
features
but
dark
and
faded
who
gave
him
profound
attention
with
her
was
another
in
better
dress
seemingly
a
girl
still
in
her
teens
though
her
face
and
neck
were
scrupulously
concealed
by
a
heavy
veil
and
her
hands
which
were
small
by
gloves
quadroones
thought
he
with
a
stir
of
deep
pity
once
as
he
uttered
some
stirring
word
he
saw
the
mother
and
daughter
if
such
they
were
while
they
still
bent
their
gaze
upon
him
clasp
each
other
hand
fervently
in
the
daughter
lap
it
was
at
these
words
my
friends
there
are
thousands
of
people
in
this
city
of
new
orleans
to
whom
society
gives
the
ten
commandments
of
god
with
all
the
rubbed
out
ah
good
gentlemen
if
god
sends
the
poor
weakling
to
purgatory
for
leaving
the
right
path
where
ought
some
of
you
to
go
who
strew
it
with
thorns
and
briers
the
movement
of
the
pair
was
only
seen
because
he
watched
for
it
he
glanced
that
way
again
as
he
said
o
god
be
very
gentle
with
those
children
who
would
be
nearer
heaven
this
day
had
they
never
had
a
father
and
mother
but
had
got
their
religious
training
from
such
a
sky
and
earth
as
we
have
in
louisiana
this
holy
morning
ah
my
friends
nature
is
a
catechism
the
mother
and
daughter
leaned
a
little
farther
forward
and
exchanged
the
same
spasmodic
as
before
the
mother
eyes
were
full
of
tears
i
once
knew
a
man
continued
the
little
priest
glancing
to
a
side
aisle
where
he
had
noticed
evariste
and
jean
sitting
against
each
other
who
was
carefully
taught
from
infancy
to
manhood
this
single
only
principle
of
life
defiance
not
justice
not
righteousness
not
even
gain
but
defiance
defiance
to
god
defiance
to
man
defiance
to
nature
defiance
to
reason
defiance
and
defiance
and
defiance
he
is
going
to
tell
it
murmured
evariste
to
jean
this
man
continued
p√®re
jerome
became
a
smuggler
and
at
last
a
pirate
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
lord
lay
not
that
sin
to
his
charge
alone
but
a
strange
thing
followed
being
in
command
of
men
of
a
sort
that
to
control
required
to
be
kept
at
the
austerest
distance
he
now
found
himself
separated
from
the
human
world
and
thrown
into
the
solemn
companionship
with
the
sea
with
the
air
with
the
storm
the
calm
the
heavens
by
day
the
heavens
by
night
my
friends
that
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
ever
found
himself
in
really
good
company
now
this
man
had
a
great
aptness
for
accounts
he
had
kept
them
had
rendered
them
there
was
beauty
to
him
in
a
correct
balanced
and
closed
account
an
account
unsatisfied
was
a
deformity
the
result
is
plain
that
man
looking
out
night
after
night
upon
the
grand
and
holy
spectacle
of
the
starry
deep
above
and
the
watery
deep
below
was
sure
to
find
himself
sooner
or
later
mastered
by
the
conviction
that
the
great
author
of
this
majestic
creation
keeps
account
of
it
and
one
night
there
came
to
him
like
a
spirit
walking
on
the
sea
the
awful
silent
question
account
with
god
how
does
it
stand
ah
friends
that
is
a
question
which
the
book
of
nature
does
not
answer
did
i
say
the
book
of
nature
is
a
catechism
yes
but
after
it
answers
the
first
question
with
nothing
but
questions
follow
and
so
one
day
this
man
gave
a
ship
full
of
merchandise
for
one
little
book
which
answered
those
questions
god
help
him
to
understand
it
and
god
help
you
monsieur
and
you
madame
sitting
here
in
your
to
beat
upon
the
breast
with
me
and
cry
too
lord
i
too
stood
by
and
consented
p√®re
jerome
had
not
intended
these
for
his
closing
words
but
just
there
straight
away
before
his
sight
and
almost
at
the
farthest
door
a
man
rose
slowly
from
his
seat
and
regarded
him
steadily
with
a
kind
bronzed
sedate
face
and
the
sermon
as
if
by
a
sign
of
command
was
ended
while
the
was
being
chanted
he
was
still
there
but
when
a
moment
after
its
close
the
eye
of
p√®re
jerome
returned
in
that
direction
his
place
was
empty
as
the
little
priest
his
labor
done
and
his
vestments
changed
was
turning
into
the
rue
royale
and
leaving
the
cathedral
out
of
sight
he
just
had
time
to
understand
that
two
women
were
purposely
allowing
him
to
overtake
them
when
the
one
nearer
him
spoke
in
the
creole
patois
saying
with
some
timid
haste
p√®re
p√®re
jerome
p√®re
jerome
we
thank
the
good
god
for
that
sermon
then
so
do
i
said
the
little
man
they
were
the
same
two
that
he
had
noticed
when
he
was
preaching
the
younger
one
bowed
silently
she
was
a
beautiful
figure
but
the
slight
effort
of
p√®re
jerome
kind
eyes
to
see
through
the
veil
was
vain
he
would
presently
have
passed
on
but
the
one
who
had
spoken
before
said
i
thought
you
lived
in
the
rue
des
ursulines
yes
i
am
going
this
way
to
see
a
sick
person
the
woman
looked
up
at
him
with
an
expression
of
mingled
confidence
and
timidity
it
must
be
a
blessed
thing
to
be
so
useful
as
to
be
needed
by
the
good
god
she
said
p√®re
jerome
smiled
god
does
not
need
me
to
look
after
his
sick
but
he
allows
me
to
do
it
just
as
you
let
your
little
boy
in
frocks
carry
in
chips
he
might
have
added
that
he
loved
to
do
it
quite
as
much
it
was
plain
the
woman
had
somewhat
to
ask
and
was
trying
to
get
courage
to
ask
it
you
have
a
little
boy
asked
the
priest
no
i
have
only
my
daughter
she
indicated
the
girl
at
her
side
then
she
began
to
say
something
else
stopped
and
with
much
nervousness
asked
p√®re
jerome
what
was
the
name
of
that
man
his
name
said
the
priest
you
wish
to
know
his
name
yes
monsieur
or
as
she
spoke
it
it
was
such
a
beautiful
story
the
speaker
companion
looked
another
way
his
name
said
father
jerome
some
say
one
name
and
some
another
some
think
it
was
jean
lafitte
the
famous
you
have
heard
of
him
and
do
you
go
to
my
church
madame
no
mich√©
not
in
the
past
but
from
this
time
yes
my
name
she
choked
a
little
and
yet
it
evidently
gave
her
pleasure
to
offer
this
mark
of
confidence
is
madame
delphine
delphine
carraze
chapter
vi
a
cry
of
distress
p√®re
jerome
smile
and
exclamation
as
some
days
later
he
entered
his
parlor
in
response
to
the
announcement
of
a
visitor
were
indicative
of
hearty
greeting
rather
than
surprise
madame
delphine
yet
surprise
could
hardly
have
been
altogether
absent
for
though
another
sunday
had
not
yet
come
around
the
slim
smallish
figure
sitting
in
a
corner
looking
very
much
alone
and
clad
in
dark
attire
which
seemed
to
have
been
washed
a
trifle
too
often
was
delphine
carraze
on
her
second
visit
and
this
he
was
confident
was
over
and
above
an
attendance
in
the
confessional
where
he
was
sure
he
had
recognized
her
voice
she
rose
bashfully
and
gave
her
hand
then
looked
to
the
floor
and
began
a
faltering
speech
with
a
swallowing
motion
in
the
throat
smiled
weakly
and
commenced
again
speaking
as
before
in
a
gentle
low
note
frequently
lifting
up
and
casting
down
her
eyes
while
shadows
of
anxiety
and
smiles
of
apology
chased
each
other
rapidly
across
her
face
she
was
trying
to
ask
his
advice
sit
down
said
he
and
when
they
had
taken
seats
she
resumed
with
downcast
eyes
you
know
probably
i
should
have
said
this
in
the
confessional
but
no
matter
madame
delphine
i
understand
you
did
not
want
an
oracle
perhaps
you
want
a
friend
she
lifted
her
eyes
shining
with
tears
and
dropped
them
again
i
she
ceased
i
have
done
a
she
dropped
her
head
and
shook
it
despondingly
a
cruel
thing
the
tears
rolled
from
her
eyes
as
she
turned
away
her
face
p√®re
jerome
remained
silent
and
presently
she
turned
again
with
the
evident
intention
of
speaking
at
length
it
began
nineteen
years
ago
by
her
eyes
which
she
had
lifted
fell
lower
than
ever
her
brow
and
neck
were
suffused
with
blushes
and
she
murmured
i
fell
in
love
she
said
no
more
and
by
and
by
p√®re
jerome
replied
well
madame
delphine
to
love
is
the
right
of
every
soul
i
believe
in
love
if
your
love
was
pure
and
lawful
i
am
sure
your
angel
guardian
smiled
upon
you
and
if
it
was
not
i
can
not
say
you
have
nothing
to
answer
for
and
yet
i
think
god
may
have
said
is
a
quadroone
all
the
rights
of
her
womanhood
trampled
in
the
mire
sin
made
easy
to
her
almost
compulsory
charge
it
to
account
of
whom
it
may
concern
no
no
said
madame
delphine
looking
up
quickly
some
of
it
might
fall
upon
her
eyes
fell
and
she
commenced
biting
her
lips
and
nervously
pinching
little
folds
in
her
skirt
he
was
good
as
good
as
the
law
would
let
him
be
better
indeed
for
he
left
me
property
which
really
the
strict
law
does
not
allow
he
loved
our
little
daughter
very
much
he
wrote
to
his
mother
and
sisters
owning
all
his
error
and
asking
them
to
take
the
child
and
bring
her
up
i
sent
her
to
them
when
he
died
which
was
soon
after
and
did
not
see
my
child
for
sixteen
years
but
we
wrote
to
each
other
all
the
time
and
she
loved
me
and
then
at
last
madame
delphine
ceased
speaking
but
went
on
diligently
with
her
agitated
fingers
turning
down
foolish
hems
lengthwise
of
her
lap
at
last
your
conquered
said
p√®re
jerome
she
nodded
the
sisters
married
the
mother
died
i
saw
that
even
where
she
was
she
did
not
escape
the
reproach
of
her
birth
and
blood
and
when
she
asked
me
to
let
her
come
the
speaker
brimming
eyes
rose
an
instant
i
know
it
was
wicked
but
i
said
come
the
tears
dripped
through
her
hands
upon
her
dress
was
it
she
who
was
with
you
last
sunday
yes
and
now
you
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
her
√ßa
oui
that
is
it
does
she
look
like
you
madame
delphine
oh
thank
god
no
you
would
never
believe
she
was
my
daughter
she
is
white
and
beautiful
you
thank
god
for
that
which
is
your
main
difficulty
madame
delphine
alas
yes
p√®re
jerome
laid
his
palms
tightly
across
his
knees
with
his
arms
bowed
out
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
pondering
i
suppose
she
is
a
sweet
good
daughter
said
he
glancing
at
madame
delphine
without
changing
his
attitude
her
answer
was
to
raise
her
eyes
rapturously
which
gives
us
the
dilemma
in
its
fullest
force
said
the
priest
speaking
as
if
to
the
floor
she
has
no
more
place
than
if
she
had
dropped
upon
a
strange
planet
he
suddenly
looked
up
with
a
brightness
which
almost
as
quickly
passed
away
and
then
he
looked
down
again
his
happy
thought
was
the
cloister
but
he
instantly
said
to
himself
they
can
not
have
overlooked
that
choice
except
intentionally
which
they
have
a
right
to
do
he
could
do
nothing
but
shake
his
head
and
suppose
you
should
suddenly
die
he
said
he
wanted
to
get
at
once
to
the
worst
the
woman
made
a
quick
gesture
and
buried
her
head
in
her
handkerchief
with
the
stifled
cry
oh
olive
my
daughter
well
madame
delphine
said
p√®re
jerome
more
buoyantly
one
thing
is
sure
we
find
a
way
out
of
this
trouble
ah
she
exclaimed
looking
heavenward
if
it
might
be
but
it
must
be
said
the
priest
but
how
shall
it
be
asked
the
desponding
woman
ah
said
p√®re
jerome
with
a
shrug
god
knows
yes
said
the
quadroone
with
a
quick
sparkle
in
her
gentle
eye
and
i
know
if
god
would
tell
anybody
he
would
tell
you
the
priest
smiled
and
rose
do
you
think
so
well
leave
me
to
think
of
it
i
will
ask
him
and
he
will
tell
you
she
replied
and
he
will
bless
you
she
rose
and
gave
her
hand
as
she
withdrew
it
she
smiled
i
had
such
a
strange
dream
she
said
backing
toward
the
door
yes
yes
i
got
my
troubles
all
mixed
up
with
your
sermon
i
dreamed
i
made
that
pirate
the
guardian
of
my
daughter
p√®re
jerome
smiled
also
and
shrugged
to
you
madame
delphine
as
you
are
placed
every
white
man
in
this
country
on
land
or
on
water
is
a
pirate
and
of
all
pirates
i
think
that
one
is
without
doubt
the
best
without
doubt
echoed
madame
delphine
wearily
still
withdrawing
backward
p√®re
jerome
stepped
forward
and
opened
the
door
the
shadow
of
some
one
approaching
it
from
without
fell
upon
the
threshold
and
a
man
entered
dressed
in
dark
blue
cottonade
lifting
from
his
head
a
fine
panama
hat
and
from
a
broad
smooth
brow
fair
where
the
hat
had
covered
it
and
dark
below
gently
stroking
back
his
very
soft
brown
locks
madame
delphine
slightly
started
aside
while
p√®re
jerome
reached
silently
but
eagerly
forward
grasped
a
larger
hand
than
his
own
and
motioned
its
owner
to
a
seat
madame
eyes
ventured
no
higher
than
to
discover
that
the
shoes
of
the
visitor
were
of
white
duck
well
p√®re
jerome
she
said
in
a
hurried
i
am
just
going
to
say
hail
marys
all
the
time
till
you
find
that
out
for
me
well
i
hope
that
will
be
soon
madame
carraze
madame
carraze
and
as
she
departed
the
priest
turned
to
the
and
extended
both
hands
saying
in
the
same
familiar
dialect
in
which
he
had
been
addressing
the
quadroone
old
playmate
after
so
many
years
they
sat
down
side
by
side
like
husband
and
wife
the
priest
playing
with
the
other
hand
and
talked
of
times
and
seasons
past
often
mentioning
evariste
and
often
jean
madame
delphine
stopped
short
home
and
returned
to
p√®re
jerome
his
entry
door
was
wide
open
and
the
parlor
door
ajar
she
passed
through
the
one
and
with
downcast
eyes
was
standing
at
the
other
her
hand
lifted
to
knock
when
the
door
was
drawn
open
and
the
white
duck
shoes
passed
out
she
saw
besides
this
time
the
blue
cottonade
suit
yes
the
voice
of
p√®re
jerome
was
saying
as
his
face
appeared
in
the
door
ah
madame
i
lef
my
said
madame
delphine
in
english
there
was
this
quiet
evidence
of
a
defiant
spirit
hidden
somewhere
down
under
her
general
timidity
that
against
a
fierce
conventional
prohibition
she
wore
a
bonnet
instead
of
the
turban
of
her
caste
and
carried
a
parasol
p√®re
jerome
turned
and
brought
it
he
made
a
motion
in
the
direction
in
which
the
late
visitor
had
disappeared
madame
delphine
you
saw
dat
man
not
his
face
you
couldn
billieve
me

i
tell
you
dat
man

jerome
he

to
hopen
a
bank
ah
said
madame
delphine
seeing
she
was
expected
to
be
astonished
p√®re
jerome
evidently
longed
to
tell
something
that
was
best
kept
secret
he
repressed
the
impulse
but
his
heart
had
to
say
something
he
threw
forward
one
hand
and
looking
pleasantly
at
madame
delphine
with
his
lips
dropped
apart
clenched
his
extended
hand
and
thrusting
it
toward
the
ground
said
in
a
solemn
he
is
god
own
banker
madame
delphine
chapter
vii
mich√©
vignevielle
madame
delphine
sold
one
of
the
corner
lots
of
her
property
she
had
almost
no
revenue
and
now
and
then
a
piece
had
to
go
as
a
consequence
of
the
sale
she
had
a
few
large
sewed
up
in
her
petticoat
and
one
day
may
be
a
fortnight
after
her
tearful
interview
with
p√®re
jerome
she
found
it
necessary
to
get
one
of
these
changed
into
small
money
she
was
in
the
rue
toulouse
looking
from
one
side
to
the
other
for
a
bank
which
was
not
in
that
street
at
all
when
she
noticed
a
small
sign
hanging
above
a
door
bearing
the
name
vignevielle
she
looked
in
p√®re
jerome
had
told
her
when
she
had
gone
to
him
to
ask
where
she
should
apply
for
change
that
if
she
could
only
wait
a
few
days
there
would
be
a
new
concern
opened
in
toulouse
street
it
really
seemed
as
if
vignevielle
was
the
name
if
she
could
judge
it
looked
to
be
and
it
was
a
private
banker
vignevielle
according
to
a
larger
inscription
which
met
her
eyes
as
she
ventured
in
behind
the
counter
exchanging
some
last
words
with
a
man
outside
who
in
withdrawing
seemed
bent
on
running
over
madame
delphine
stood
the
man
in
blue
cottonade
whom
she
had
met
in
p√®re
jerome
now
for
the
first
time
she
saw
his
face
its
strong
grave
human
kindness
shining
softly
on
each
and
every
bronzed
feature
the
recognition
was
mutual
he
took
pains
to
speak
first
saying
in
a
tone
and
in
the
language
he
had
last
heard
her
use
i
kin
serve

mich√©
she
pulled
from
her
pocket
a
wad
of
dark
cotton
handkerchief
from
which
she
began
to
untie
the
imprisoned
note
madame
delphine
had
an
uncommonly
sweet
voice
and
it
seemed
so
to
strike
monsieur
vignevielle
he
spoke
to
her
once
or
twice
more
as
he
waited
on
her
each
time
in
english
as
though
he
enjoyed
the
humble
melody
of
its
tone
and
presently
as
she
turned
to
go
he
said
madame
carraze
she
started
a
little
but
bethought
herself
instantly
that
he
had
heard
her
name
in
p√®re
jerome
parlor
the
good
father
might
even
have
said
a
few
words
about
her
after
her
first
departure
he
had
such
an
overflowing
heart
madame
carraze
said

he
drew
from
his
a
note
resembling
the
one
he
had
just

to

certain
tests
of

with
much
dismay

and
gave
no

of

she
asked
a

timidly
and
as

turned
to
give
his

to
a
third
visitor
reiterated

said
turning
so
suddenly
as
to
make
the
frightened
little
woman
start
but
extending
his
palm
with
a
show
of
frankness
and
assuming
a
look

the

seemed
only
to
give
his
words
a
more
kindly
authoritative
import
and
as
he
turned
away
again
with
a
manner
suggestive
of
finality
madame
delphine
found
no
choice
but
to
depart
but
she
went
away
loving
the
ground
beneath
the
feet
of
monsieur
vignevielle
oh
p√®re
jerome
she
exclaimed
in
the
corrupt
french
of
her
caste
meeting
the
little
father
on
the
street
a
few
days
later

madame

i
have
done
so
this
very
day
she
replied
with
more
happiness
in
her
eyes
than
p√®re
jerome
had
ever
before
seen
there
madame
delphine
he
said
his
own
eyes
sparkling
make
your

for
myself
being
a
priest
it
would
not
be
best
but
ask
him
i
believe
he
will
not
refuse
you
madame
delphine
face
grew
still
brighter
as
he
spoke
it
was
in
my
mind
she
said
yet
to
the
timorous
madame
delphine
many
trifles
became
one
after
another
an
impediment
to
the
making
of
this
proposal
and
many
weeks
elapsed
before
further
delay
was
positively
without
excuse
but
at
length
one
day
in
may
in
a
small
private
office
behind
monsieur
vignevielle
he
sitting
beside
a
table
and
she
more
timid
and
demure
than
ever
having
just
taken
a
chair
by
the
door
she
said
trying
with
a
little
bashful
laugh
to
make
the
matter
seem
unimportant
and
yet
with
some
tremor
of
voice
mich√©

she
looked
up
with
grateful
but
her
eyes
dropped
again
as
she
said
mich√©
vignevielle
here
she
choked
and
began
her
peculiar
motion
of
laying
folds
in
the
skirt
of
her
dress
with
trembling
fingers
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
as
they
met
the
look
of
deep
and
placid
kindness
that
was
in
his
face
some
courage
returned
and
she
said

there

to

the

waited
in
silence
i

he
smiled
for
she
looked
at

as

parting

she
went
very
shortly
was
gratitude
beyond
speech
monsieur
vignevielle
returned
to
the
seat
he
had
left
and
resumed
a
newspaper
the
in
all
probability
which
he
had
laid
down
upon
madame
delphine
entrance
his
eyes
fell
upon
a
paragraph
which
had
previously
escaped
his
notice
there
they
rested
either
he
read
it
over
and
over
unwearyingly
or
he
was
lost
in
thought
jean
thompson
entered
now
said
thompson
in
a
suppressed
tone
bending
a
little
across
the
table
and
laying
one
palm
upon
a
package
of
papers
which
lay
in
the
other
it
is
completed
you
could
retire
from
your
business
any
day
inside
of
six
hours
without
loss
to
anybody
both
here
and
elsewhere
let
it
be
understood
that
where
good
english
is
given
the
words
were
spoken
in
good
french
monsieur
vignevielle
raised
his
eyes
and
extended
the
newspaper
to
the
attorney
who
received
it
and
read
the
paragraph
its
substance
was
that
a
certain
vessel
of
the
navy
had
returned
from
a
cruise
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
straits
of
florida
where
she
had
done
valuable
service
against
the
pirates
having
for
instance
destroyed
in
one
fortnight
in
january
last
twelve
pirate
vessels
afloat
two
on
the
stocks
and
three
establishments
ashore
united

repeated
jean
thompson
do
you
know
her
we
are
acquainted
said
monsieur
vignevielle
chapter
viii
she
a
quiet
footstep
a
grave
new
presence
on
financial
sidewalks
a
neat
garb
slightly
out
of
date
a
gently
strong
and
kindly
pensive
face
a
silent
bow
a
new
sign
in
the
rue
toulouse
a
lone
figure
with
a
cane
walking
in
meditation
in
the
evening
light
under
the
willows
of
canal
marigny
a
window
in
the
rue
conti
these
were
all
a
fall
of
dew
would
scarce
have
been
more
quiet
than
was
the
return
of
ursin
to
the
precincts
of
his
birth
and
early
life
but
we
hardly
give
the
event
its
right
name
it
was
capitaine
lemaitre
who
had
disappeared
it
was
monsieur
vignevielle
who
had
come
back
the
pleasures
the
haunts
the
companions
that
had
once
held
out
their
charms
to
the
impetuous
youth
offered
no
enticements
to
madame
delphine
banker
there
is
this
to
be
said
even
for
the
pride
his
grandfather
had
taught
him
that
it
had
always
held
him
above
low
indulgences
and
though
he
had
dallied
with
kings
queens
and
knaves
through
all
the
mazes
of
faro
rondeau
and
craps
he
had
done
it
loftily
but
now
he
maintained
a
peaceful
estrangement
from
all
evariste
and
jean
themselves
found
him
only
by
seeking
it
is
the
right
way
he
said
to
p√®re
jerome
the
day
we
saw
him
there
ursin
lemaitre
is
dead
i
have
buried
him
he
left
a
will
i
am
his
executor
he
is
crazy
said
his
lawyer
impatiently
on
the
replied
the
little
priest
come
ad
evariste
spoke
look
at
his
face
jean
men
with
that
kind
of
face
are
the
last
to
go
crazy
you
have
not
proved
that
replied
jean
with
an
attorney
obstinacy
you
should
have
heard
him
talk
the
other
day
about
that
newspaper
paragraph
have
taken
ursin
lemaitre
head
i
have
it
with
me
i
claim
the
reward
but
i
desire
to
commute
it
to
citizenship
he
is
crazy
of
course
jean
thompson
did
not
believe
what
he
said
but
he
said
it
and
in
his
vexation
repeated
it
on
the
and
at
the
clubs
and
presently
it
took
the
shape
of
a
sly
rumor
that
the
returned
rover
was
a
trifle
snarled
in
his
this
whisper
was
helped
into
circulation
by
many
trivial
eccentricities
of
manner
and
by
the
unaccountable
oddness
of
some
of
his
transactions
in
business
my
dear
sir
cried
his
astounded
lawyer
one
day
you
are
not
running
a
charitable
institution
how
do
you
know
said
monsieur
vignevielle
there
the
conversation
ceased
why
do
you
not
found
hospitals
and
asylums
at
once
asked
the
attorney
at
another
time
with
a
vexed
laugh
and
get
the
credit
of
it
and
make
the
end
worse
than
the
beginning
said
the
banker
with
a
gentle
smile
turning
away
to
a
desk
of
books
bah
muttered
jean
thompson
monsieur
vignevielle
betrayed
one
very
bad
symptom
wherever
he
went
he
seemed
looking
for
somebody
it
may
have
been
perceptible
only
to
those
who
were
sufficiently
interested
in
him
to
study
his
movements
but
those
who
saw
it
once
saw
it
always
he
never
passed
an
open
door
or
gate
but
he
glanced
in
and
often
where
it
stood
but
slightly
ajar
you
might
see
him
give
it
a
gentle
push
with
his
hand
or
cane
it
was
very
singular
he
walked
much
alone
after
dark
the
garroters
we
might
say
at
those
times
the
city
particular
terror
by
night
never
crossed
his
path
he
was
one
of
those
men
for
whom
danger
appears
to
stand
aside
one
beautiful
summer
night
when
all
nature
seemed
hushed
in
ecstasy
the
last
blush
gone
that
told
of
the
sun
parting
monsieur
vignevielle
in
the
course
of
one
of
those
contemplative
uncompanioned
walks
which
it
was
his
habit
to
take
came
slowly
along
the
more
open
portion
of
the
rue
royale
with
a
step
which
was
soft
without
intention
occasionally
touching
the
end
of
his
stout
cane
gently
to
the
ground
and
looking
upward
among
his
old
acquaintances
the
stars
it
was
one
of
those
southern
nights
under
whose
spell
all
the
sterner
energies
of
the
mind
cloak
themselves
and
lie
down
in
bivouac
and
the
fancy
and
the
imagination
that
can
not
sleep
slip
their
fetters
and
escape
beckoned
away
from
behind
every
flowering
bush
and
tree
and
every
stretch
of
lonely
walk
by
the
genius
of
poetry
the
air
stirred
softly
now
and
then
and
was
still
again
as
if
the
breezes
lifted
their
expectant
pinions
and
lowered
them
once
more
awaiting
the
rising
of
the
moon
in
a
silence
which
fell
upon
the
fields
the
roads
the
gardens
the
walls
and
the
suburban
and
streets
like
a
pause
in
worship
and
anon
she
rose
monsieur
vignevielle
steps
were
bent
toward
the
more
central
part
of
the
town
and
he
was
presently
passing
along
a
high
close
on
the
side
of
the
way
when
just
within
this
inclosure
and
almost
overhead
in
the
dark
boughs
of
a
large
a
began
the
first
low
of
his
song
it
may
have
been
only
the
nearness
of
the
songster
that
attracted
the
passer
attention
but
he
paused
and
looked
up
and
then
he
remarked
something
more
that
the
air
where
he
had
stopped
was
filled
with
the
overpowering
sweetness
of
the
he
looked
around
it
could
only
be
inside
the
fence
there
was
a
gate
just
there
would
he
push
it
as
his
wont
was
the
grass
was
growing
about
it
in
a
thick
turf
as
though
the
entrance
had
not
been
used
for
years
an
iron
staple
clasped
the
and
was
driven
deep
into
the
but
now
an
eye
that
had
been
in
the
blacksmithing
business
an
eye
which
had
later
received
high
training
as
an
eye
for
fastenings
fell
upon
that
staple
and
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
wood
had
shrunk
from
it
and
it
had
sprung
from
its
hold
though
without
falling
out
the
strange
habit
asserted
itself
he
laid
his
large
hand
upon
the
the
turf
at
the
base
yielded
and
the
tall
gate
was
drawn
partly
open
at
that
moment
as
at
the
moment
whenever
he
drew
or
pushed
a
door
or
gate
or
looked
in
at
a
window
he
was
thinking
of
one
the
image
of
whose
face
and
form
had
never
left
his
inner
vision
since
the
day
it
had
met
him
in
his
life
path
and
turned
him
face
about
from
the
way
of
destruction
the
bird
ceased
the
cause
of
the
interruption
standing
within
the
opening
saw
before
him
much
obscured
by
its
own
numerous
shadows
a
broad
garden
among
whose
untrimmed
and
tangled
vines
and
often
also
in
its
old
walks
of
pounded
shell
the
and
had
spread
riotously
and
sturdy
weeds
stood
up
in
bloom
he
stepped
in
and
drew
the
gate
to
after
him
there
very
near
by
was
the
clump
of
jasmine
whose
ravishing
odor
had
tempted
him
it
stood
just
beyond
a
brightly
moonlit
path
which
turned
from
him
in
a
curve
toward
the
residence
a
little
distance
to
the
right
and
escaped
the
view
at
a
point
where
it
seemed
more
than
likely
a
door
of
the
house
might
open
upon
it
while
he
still
looked
there
fell
upon
his
ear
from
around
that
curve
a
light
footstep
on
the
broken
shells
one
only
and
then
all
was
for
a
moment
still
again
had
he
mistaken
no
the
same
soft
click
was
repeated
nearer
by
a
pale
glimpse
of
robes
came
through
the
tangle
and
then
plainly
to
view
appeared
an
outline
a
presence
a
form
a
spirit
a
girl
from
throat
to
instep
she
was
as
white
as
cynthia
something
above
the
medium
height
slender
lithe
her
abundant
hair
rolling
in
dark
rich
waves
back
from
her
brows
and
down
from
her
crown
and
falling
in
two
heavy
plaits
beyond
her
round
broadly
girt
waist
and
full
to
her
knees
a
few
escaping
locks
eddying
lightly
on
her
graceful
neck
and
her
temples
her
arms
half
hid
in
a
snowy
mist
of
sleeve
let
down
to
guide
her
spotless
skirts
free
from
the
dewy
touch
of
the
grass
straight
down
the
path
she
came
will
she
stop
will
she
turn
aside
will
she
espy
the
dark
form
in
the
deep
shade
of
the
orange
and
with
one
piercing
scream
wheel
and
vanish
she
draws
near
she
approaches
the
jasmine
she
raises
her
arms
the
sleeves
falling
like
a
vapor
down
to
the
shoulders
rises
upon
tiptoe
and
plucks
a
spray
o
memory
can
it
be
it
be
is
this
his
quest
or
is
it
lunacy
the
ground
seems
to
vignevielle
the
unsteady
sea
and
he
to
stand
once
more
on
a
deck
and
she
as
she
is
now
if
she
but
turn
toward
the
orange
the
whole
glory
of
the
moon
will
shine
upon
her
face
his
heart
stands
still
he
is
waiting
for
her
to
do
that
she
reaches
up
again
this
time
a
bunch
for
her
mother
that
neck
and
throat
now
she
fastens
a
spray
in
her
hair
the
can
not
withhold
he
breaks
into
song
she
turns
she
turns
her
face
it
is
she
it
is
she
madame
delphine
daughter
is
the
girl
he
met
on
the
ship
chapter
ix
olive
she
was
just
passing
seventeen
that
beautiful
year
when
the
heart
of
the
maiden
still
beats
quickly
with
the
surprise
of
her
new
dominion
while
with
gentle
dignity
her
brow
accepts
the
holy
coronation
of
womanhood
the
forehead
and
temples
beneath
her
loosely
bound
hair
were
fair
without
paleness
and
meek
without
languor
she
had
the
soft
lacklustre
beauty
of
the
south
no
ruddiness
of
coral
no
waxen
white
no
pink
of
shell
no
heavenly
blue
in
the
glance
but
a
face
that
seemed
in
all
its
other
beauties
only
a
tender
accompaniment
for
the
large
brown
melting
eyes
where
the
openness
of
mingled
dreamily
with
the
sweet
mysteries
of
maiden
thought
we
say
no
color
of
shell
on
face
or
throat
but
this
was
no
deficiency
that
which
took
its
place
being
the
warm
transparent
tint
of
sculptured
ivory
this
side
which
led
from
madame
delphine
house
into
her
garden
was
overarched
partly
by
an
old
remnant
of
lattice
and
partly
by
a
against
whose
small
polished
trunk
leaned
a
rustic
seat
here
madame
delphine
and
olive
loved
to
sit
when
the
twilights
were
balmy
or
the
moon
was
bright
said
madame
delphine
on
one
of
these
evenings
why
do
you
dream
so
much
she
spoke
in
the
most
natural
to
her
and
which
her
daughter
had
easily
learned
the
girl
turned
her
face
to
her
mother
and
smiled
then
dropped
her
glance
to
the
hands
in
her
own
lap
which
were
listlessly
handling
the
end
of
a
ribbon
the
mother
looked
at
her
with
fond
solicitude
her
dress
was
white
again
this
was
but
one
night
since
that
in
which
monsieur
vignevielle
had
seen
her
at
the
bush
of
he
had
not
been
discovered
but
had
gone
away
shutting
the
gate
and
leaving
it
as
he
had
found
it
her
head
was
uncovered
its
plaited
masses
quite
black
in
the
moonlight
hung
down
and
coiled
upon
the
bench
by
her
side
her
chaste
drapery
was
of
that
revived
classic
order
which
the
world
of
fashion
was
again
laying
aside
to
the
medi√¶val
bondage
of
the
for
new
orleans
was
behind
the
fashionable
world
and
madame
delphine
and
her
daughter
were
behind
new
orleans
a
delicate
scarf
pale
blue
of
lightly
netted
worsted
fell
from
either
shoulder
down
beside
her
hands
the
look
that
was
bent
upon
her
changed
perforce
to
one
of
gentle
admiration
she
seemed
the
goddess
of
the
garden
olive
glanced
up
madame
delphine
was
not
prepared
for
the
movement
and
on
that
account
repeated
her
question
what
are
you
thinking
about
the
dreamer
took
the
hand
that
was
laid
upon
hers
between
her
own
palms
bowed
her
head
and
gave
them
a
soft
kiss
the
mother
submitted
wherefore
in
the
silence
which
followed
a
daughter
conscience
felt
the
burden
of
having
withheld
an
answer
and
olive
presently
said
as
the
pair
sat
looking
up
into
the
sky
i
was
thinking
of
p√®re
jerome
sermon
madame
delphine
had
feared
so
olive
had
lived
on
it
ever
since
the
day
it
was
preached
the
poor
mother
was
almost
ready
to
repent
having
ever
afforded
her
the
opportunity
of
hearing
it
meat
and
drink
had
become
of
secondary
value
to
her
daughter
she
fed
upon
the
sermon
olive
felt
her
mother
thought
and
knew
that
her
mother
knew
her
own
but
now
that
she
had
confessed
she
would
ask
a
question
do
you
think
that
p√®re
jerome
knows
it
was
i
who
gave
that
missal
no
said
madame
delphine
i
am
sure
he
does
not
another
question
came
more
timidly
do
do
you
think
he
knows
yes
i
do
he
said
in
his
sermon
he
did
both
remained
for
a
long
time
very
still
watching
the
moon
gliding
in
and
through
among
the
small
clouds
at
last
the
daughter
spoke
again
i
wish
i
was
p√®re
i
wish
i
was
as
good
as
p√®re
jerome
my
child
said
madame
delphine
her
tone
betraying
a
painful
summoning
of
strength
to
say
what
she
had
lacked
the
courage
to
utter
my
child
i
pray
the
good
god
you
will
not
let
your
heart
go
after
one
whom
you
may
never
see
in
this
world
the
maiden
turned
her
glance
and
their
eyes
met
she
cast
her
arms
about
her
mother
neck
laid
her
cheek
upon
it
for
a
moment
and
then
feeling
the
maternal
tear
lifted
her
lips
and
kissing
her
said
i
will
not
i
will
not
but
the
voice
was
one
not
of
willing
consent
but
of
desperate
resolution
it
would
be
useless
anyhow
said
the
mother
laying
her
arm
around
her
daughter
waist
olive
repeated
the
kiss
prolonging
it
passionately
i
have
nobody
but
you
murmured
the
girl
i
am
a
poor
quadroone
she
threw
back
her
plaited
hair
for
a
third
embrace
when
a
sound
in
the
shrubbery
startled
them
ci
√ßa
called
madame
delphine
in
a
frightened
voice
as
the
two
stood
up
holding
to
each
other
no
answer
it
was
only
the
dropping
of
a
twig
she
whispered
after
a
long
holding
of
the
breath
but
they
went
into
the
house
and
barred
it
everywhere
it
was
no
longer
pleasant
to
sit
up
they
retired
and
in
course
of
time
but
not
soon
they
fell
asleep
holding
each
other
very
tight
and
fearing
even
in
their
dreams
to
hear
another
twig
fall

monsieur
vignevielle
looked
in
at
no
more
doors
or
windows
but
if
the
disappearance
of
this
symptom
was
a
favorable
sign
others
came
to
notice
which
were
especially
bad
for
instance
wakefulness
at
any
hour
of
the
night
the
city
guard
which
itself
dared
not
patrol
singly
would
meet
him
on
his
slow
unmolested
walk
seems
to
enjoy
it
said
jean
thompson
the
worst
sort
of
evidence
if
he
showed
distress
of
mind
it
would
not
be
so
bad
but
his
calmness
ugly
feature
the
attorney
had
held
his
ground
so
long
that
he
began
really
to
believe
it
was
tenable
by
day
it
is
true
monsieur
vignevielle
was
at
his
post
in
his
quiet
bank
yet
here
day
by
day
he
was
the
source
of
more
and
more
vivid
astonishment
to
those
who
held
preconceived
notions
of
a
calling
as
a
banker
at
least
he
was
certainly
out
of
balance
while
as
a
promenader
it
seemed
to
those
who
watched
him
that
his
ruling
idea
had
now
veered
about
and
that
of
late
he
was
ever
on
the
quiet
alert
not
to
find
but
to
evade
somebody
olive
my
child
whispered
madame
delphine
one
morning
as
the
pair
were
kneeling
side
by
side
on
the
tiled
floor
of
the
church
yonder
is
mich√©
vignevielle
if
you
will
only
look
at
once
he
is
just
passing
a
little
in
ah
much
too
slow
again
he
stepped
out
by
the
side
door
the
mother
thought
it
a
strange
providence
that
monsieur
vignevielle
should
always
be
disappearing
whenever
olive
was
with
her
one
early
dawn
madame
delphine
with
a
small
empty
basket
on
her
arm
stepped
out
upon
the
in
front
of
her
house
shut
and
fastened
the
door
very
softly
and
stole
out
in
the
direction
whence
you
could
faintly
catch
in
the
stillness
of
the
daybreak
the
songs
of
the
gascon
butchers
and
the
pounding
of
their
on
the
stalls
of
the
distant
she
was
going
to
see
if
she
could
find
some
birds
for
olive
the
child
appetite
was
so
poor
and
as
she
was
out
she
would
drop
an
early
prayer
at
the
cathedral
faith
and
works
one
must
venture
something
sometimes
in
the
cause
of
religion
thought
she
as
she
started
timorously
on
her
way
but
she
had
not
gone
a
dozen
steps
before
she
repented
her
temerity
there
was
some
one
behind
her
there
should
not
be
anything
terrible
in
a
footstep
merely
because
it
is
masculine
but
madame
delphine
mind
was
not
prepared
to
consider
that
a
terrible
secret
was
haunting
her
yesterday
morning
she
had
found
a
in
the
garden
she
had
not
disclosed
the
discovery
to
olive
but
she
had
hardly
closed
her
eyes
the
whole
night
the
step
behind
her
now
might
be
the
fall
of
that
very
shoe
she
quickened
her
pace
but
did
not
leave
the
sound
behind
she
hurried
forward
almost
at
a
run
yet
it
was
still
there
no
farther
no
nearer
two
frights
were
upon
her
at
once
one
for
herself
another
for
olive
left
alone
in
the
house
but
she
had
but
the
one
prayer
god
protect
my
child
after
a
fearful
time
she
reached
a
place
of
safety
the
cathedral
there
panting
she
knelt
long
enough
to
know
the
pursuit
was
at
least
suspended
and
then
arose
hoping
and
praying
all
the
saints
that
she
might
find
the
way
clear
for
her
return
in
all
haste
to
olive
she
approached
a
different
door
from
that
by
which
she
had
entered
her
eyes
in
all
directions
and
her
heart
in
her
throat
madame
carraze
she
started
wildly
and
almost
screamed
though
the
voice
was
soft
and
mild
monsieur
vignevielle
came
slowly
forward
from
the
shade
of
the
wall
they
met
beside
a
bench
upon
which
she
dropped
her
basket

madame

was
a
helpless
timid
thing
but
her
eyes
showed
she
was
about
to
resent
this
offer
monsieur
vignevielle
put
forth
his
hand
it
touched
her

and
said

with

and
burst
into
tears
then
looked
up
with
an
effort
to
smile
and
wept
afresh
what
have

asked
the

in
a

tone
she
leaned
forward
and
unfastened
her
why
do

the
girl
eyes
filled
the
mother
looked
up
into
her
face
and
said
no
it
is
nothing
nothing
only
that
turning
her
head
from
side
to

with
a
slow
emotional
emphasis

olive
drew
a
chair
close
to
her
mother
sat
down
and
took
the
little
yellow
hands
into
her
own
white
lap
and
looked
tenderly
into
her
eyes
madame
delphine
felt
herself
yielding
she
must
make
a
show
of
telling
something
he
sent
you

birds
the
girl
drew
her
face
back
a
little
the
little
woman
turned
away
trying
in
vain
to
hide
her
tearful
smile
and
they
laughed
together
olive
mingling
a
daughter
fond
kiss
with
her
laughter
there
is
something
else
she
said
and
you
shall
tell
me
yes
replied
madame
delphine
only
let
me
get
composed
but
she
did
not
get
so
later
in
the
morning
she
came
to
olive
with
the
timid
yet
startling
proposal
that
they
would
do
what
they
could
to
brighten
up
the
front
room
olive
was
mystified
and
troubled
but
consented
and
thereupon
the
mother
spirits
rose
the
work
began
and
presently
ensued
all
the
thumping
the
trundling
the
lifting
and
letting
down
the
raising
and
swallowing
of
dust
and
the
smells
of
turpentine
brass
pumice
and
woollen
rags
that
go
to
characterize
a
housekeeper
and
still
as
the
work
progressed
madame
delphine
heart
grew
light
and
her
little
black
eyes
sparkled
we
like
a
clean
parlor
my
daughter
even
though
no
one
is
ever
coming
to
see
us
eh
she
said
as
entering
the
apartment
she
at
last
sat
down
late
in
the
afternoon
she
had
put
on
her
best
attire
olive
was
not
there
to
reply
the
mother
called
but
got
no
answer
she
rose
with
an
uneasy
heart
and
met
her
a
few
steps
beyond
the
door
that
opened
into
the
garden
in
a
path
which
came
up
from
an
old
latticed
bower
olive
was
approaching
slowly
her
face
pale
and
wild
there
was
an
agony
of
hostile
dismay
in
the
look
and
the
trembling
and
appealing
tone
with
which
taking
the
frightened
mother
cheeks
between
her
palms
she
said
ma
m√®re
qui
vini
ce
soir
who
is
coming
here
this
evening
why
my
dear
child
i
was
just
saying
we
like
a
clean
but
the
daughter
was
desperate
oh
tell
me
my
mother
is
coming
my
darling
it
is
our
blessed
friend
mich√©
vignevielle
to
see
me
cried
the
girl
yes
oh
my
mother
what
have
you
done
why
olive
my
child
exclaimed
the
little
mother
bursting
into
tears
do
you
forget
it
is
mich√©
vignevielle
who
has
promised
to
protect
you
when
i
die
the
daughter
had
turned
away
and
entered
the
door
but
she
faced
around
again
and
extending
her
arms
toward
her
mother
cried
how
can
he
is
a
white
man
i
am
a
poor
ah
replied
madame
delphine
seizing
the
outstretched
hands
it
is
there
it
is
there
that
he
shows
himself
the
best
man
alive
he
sees
that
difficulty
he
proposes
to
meet
it
he
says
he
will
find
you
a
suitor
olive
freed
her
hands
violently
motioned
her
mother
back
and
stood
proudly
drawn
up
flashing
an
indignation
too
great
for
speech
but
the
next
moment
she
had
uttered
a
cry
and
was
sobbing
on
the
floor
the
mother
knelt
beside
her
and
threw
an
arm
about
her
shoulders
oh
my
sweet
daughter
you
must
not
cry
i
did
not
want
to
tell
you
at
all
i
did
not
want
to
tell
you
it
is
fair
for
you
to
cry
so
hard

olive
rose
suddenly
silently
declined
her
mother
aid
and
went
alone
to
their
chamber
in
the
madame
delphine
wandered
drearily
from
door
to
window
from
window
to
door
and
presently
into
the
front
room
which
now
seemed
dismal
beyond
degree
there
was
a
great
argand
lamp
in
one
corner
how
she
had
labored
that
day
to
prepare
it
for
evening
illumination
a
little
beyond
it
on
the
wall
hung
a
crucifix
she
knelt
under
it
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
it
and
thus
silently
remained
until
its
outline
was
undistinguishable
in
the
deepening
shadows
of
evening
she
arose
a
few
minutes
later
as
she
was
trying
to
light
the
lamp
an
approaching
step
on
the
sidewalk
seemed
to
pause
her
heart
stood
still
she
softly
laid
the
out
of
her
hands
a
shoe
grated
softly
on
the
stone
step
and
madame
delphine
her
heart
beating
in
great
thuds
without
waiting
for
a
knock
opened
the
door
bowed
low
and
exclaimed
in
a
soft
perturbed
voice
mich√©
vignevielle
he
entered
hat
in
hand
and
with
that
almost
noiseless
tread
which
we
have
noticed
she
gave
him
a
chair
and
closed
the
door
then
hastened
with
words
of
apology
back
to
her
task
of
lighting
the
lamp
but
her
hands
paused
in
their
work
again
olive
step
was
on
the
stairs
then
it
came
off
the
stairs
then
it
was
in
the
next
room
and
then
there
was
the
whisper
of
soft
robes
a
breath
of
gentle
perfume
and
a
snowy
figure
in
the
door
she
was
dressed
for
the
evening
maman
madame
delphine
was
struggling
desperately
with
the
lamp
and
at
that
moment
it
responded
with
a
tiny
bead
of
light
i
am
here
my
daughter
she
hastened
to
the
door
and
olive
all
unaware
of
a
third
presence
lifted
her
white
arms
laid
them
about
her
mother
neck
and
ignoring
her
effort
to
speak
wrested
a
fervent
kiss
from
her
lips
the
crystal
of
the
lamp
sent
out
a
faint
gleam
it
grew
it
spread
on
every
side
the
ceiling
the
walls
lighted
up
the
crucifix
the
furniture
of
the
room
came
back
into
shape
maman
cried
olive
with
a
tremor
of
consternation
it
is
mich√©
vignevielle
my
daughter
the
gloom
melted
swiftly
away
before
the
eyes
of
the
startled
maiden
a
dark
form
stood
out
against
the
farther
wall
and
the
light
expanding
to
the
full
shone
clearly
upon
the
unmoving
figure
and
quiet
face
of
capitaine
lemaitre
chapter
xii
the
mother
bird
one
afternoon
some
three
weeks
after
capitaine
lemaitre
had
called
on
madame
delphine
the
priest
started
to
make
a
pastoral
call
and
had
hardly
left
the
gate
of
his
cottage
when
a
person
overtaking
him
plucked
his
gown
p√®re
jerome
he
turned
the
face
that
met
his
was
so
changed
with
excitement
and
distress
that
for
an
instant
he
did
not
recognize
it
why
madame
delphine
oh
p√®re
jerome
i
wan
see

so
bad
so

oul√©
dit
i
godd

to

two
languages
might
be
more
successful
than
one
she
seemed
to
think
we
had
better
go
back
to
my
parlor
said
the
priest
in
their
native
tongue
they
returned
madame
delphine
very
step
was
altered
nervous
and
inelastic
she
swung
one
arm
as
she
walked
and
brandished
a
fan
i
was
glad
yass
to
kedge
you
she
said
as
they
mounted
the
front
outdoor
stair
following
her
speech
with
a
slight
unmusical
laugh
and
fanning
herself
with
unconscious
fury
she
remarked
again
taking
the
chair
he
offered
and
continuing
to
ply
the
fan
p√®re
jerome
laid
his
hat
upon
a
chest
of
drawers
sat
down
opposite
her
and
said
as
he
wiped
his
kindly
face
well
madame
carraze
gentle
as
the
tone
was
she
started
ceased
fanning
lowered
the
fan
to
her
knee
and
commenced
smoothing
its
feathers
p√®re
jerome
she
gnawed
her
lip
and
shook
her
head
well
she
burst
into
tears
the
priest
rose
and
loosed
the
curtain
of
one
of
the
windows
he
did
it
slowly
as
slowly
as
he
could
and
as
he
came
back
she
lifted
her
face
with
sudden
energy
and
exclaimed
oh
p√®re
jerome
de
law
is
brogue
de
law

brogue
i
brogue
it
was
me
was
me
the
tears
gushed
out
again
but
she
shut
her
lips
very
tight
and
dumbly
turned
away
her
face
p√®re
jerome
waited
a
little
before
replying
then
he
said
very
gently
i
suppose
dad
muss
been
by
accyden
madame
delphine
the
little
father
felt
a
wish
one
which
he
often
had
when
weeping
women
were
before
him
that
he
were
an
angel
instead
of
a
man
long
enough
to
press
the
tearful
cheek
upon
his
breast
and
assure
the
weeper
god
would
not
let
the
lawyers
and
judges
hurt
her
he
allowed
a
few
moments
more
to
pass
and
then
asked
madame
delphine

oh

and
immediately
madame
delphine
commenced
savagely
drawing
a
thread
in
the
fabric
of
her
skirt
with
one
trembling
hand
while
she
drove
the
fan
with
the
other
dey
goin
git

on
the
priest
face
came
a
look
of
pained
surprise
he
slowly
said
is
dad
possib
madame
delphine

she
replied
at
first
without
lifting
her
eyes
and
then
again
yass
looking
full
upon
him
through
her
tears
yass

he
rose
and
walked
once
across
the
room
returned
and
said
in
the
creole
dialect
is

a
good
man
without
doubt
de
bez

replied
madame
delphine
with
a
rapturous
smile
my
poor
dear
friend
said
the
priest
i
am
afraid
you
are
being
deceived
by
somebody
there
was
the
pride
of
an
unswerving
faith
in
the
triumphant
tone
and
smile
with
which
she
replied
raising
and
slowly
shaking
her
head
mich√©

he
turned
again
and
with
his
hands
at
his
back
and
his
eyes
cast
down
slowly
paced
the
floor
he
a
good
man
he
said
by
and
by
as
if
he
thought
aloud
at
length
he
halted
before
the
woman
madame
delphine
the
distressed
glance
with
which
she
had
been
following
his
steps
was
lifted
to
his
eyes

to

and
putting
his

away
with
an

suddenly

a
priest
of
less
might
have
replied
that
the
law
is
the
law
but
p√®re
jerome
saw
that
madame
delphine
was
expecting
this
very
response
wherefore
he
said
with
gentleness
madame
delphine
a
priest
is
not
a
bailiff
but
a
physician
how
can
i
help
you
a
grateful
light
shone
a
moment
in
her
eyes
yet
there
remained
a
piteous
hostility
in
the
tone
in
which
she
demanded
y√©
f√©
cette
m√©chanique
l√†
what
business
had
they
to
make
that
contraption
his
answer
was
a
shrug
with
his
palms
extended
and
a
short
disclamatory
ah
he
started
to
resume
his
walk
but
turned
to
her
again
and
said
why
did
they
make
that
law
well
they
made
it
to
keep
the
two
races
separate
madame
delphine
startled
the
speaker
with
a
loud
harsh
angry
laugh
fire
came
from
her
eyes
and
her
lip
curled
with
scorn
then
they
made
a
lie
p√®re
jerome

they
do
not
want
to
keep

separated
no
no
but
they

despised
she
laid
her
hand
on
her
heart
and
frowned
upward
with
physical
pain
but
very
well
from
which
race
do
they
want
to
keep
my
daughter
separate
she
is
seven
parts
white
the
law
did
not
stop
her
from
being
that
and
now
when

my

what
a

she
dropped
back
into
her
seat
the
tears
came
in
a
flood
which
she
made
no
attempt
to
restrain
no
she
began
again
and
here

p√®re
jerome
had
heard
her
out
not
interrupting
by
so
much
as
a
motion
of
the
hand
now
his
decision
was
made
and
he
touched
her
softly
with
the
ends
of
his
fingers
madame

cried
with

gleam
of
joy

he
offered
his
hand
she
seized
and
kissed
it
thrice
covering
it
with
tears
at
the
same
time
lifting
up
her
eyes
to
his
and
murmuring
de
bez
man
god
evva
mague
at
the
door
she
turned
to
offer
a
more
conventional
but
he
was
following
her
out
bareheaded
at
the
gate
they
paused
an
instant
and
then
parted
with
a
simple
adieu
she
going
home
and
he
returning
for
his
hat
and
starting
again
upon
his
interrupted
business
before
he
came
back
to
his
own
house
he
stopped
at
the
lodgings
of
monsieur
vignevielle
but
did
not
find
him
in
indeed
the
servant
at
the
door
said
he
said
he
might
not
return
for
some
days
or
weeks
so
p√®re
jerome
much
wondering
made
a
second
detour
toward
the
residence
of
one
of
monsieur
vignevielle
employ√©s
yes
said
the
clerk
his
instructions
are
to
hold
the
business
as
far
as
practicable
in
suspense
during
his
absence
everything
is
in
another
name
and
then
he
whispered
officers
of
the
government
looking
for
him
information
got
from
some
of
the
prisoners
taken
months
ago
by
the
united
states
brig
but
a
still
softer
whisper
have
no
fear
they
will
never
find
him
jean
thompson
and
evariste
varrillat
have
hid
him
away
too
well
for
that
chapter
xiii
tribulation
the
saturday
following
was
a
very
beautiful
day
in
the
morning
a
light
fall
of
rain
had
passed
across
the
town
and
all
the
afternoon
you
could
see
signs
here
and
there
upon
the
horizon
of
other
showers
the
ground
was
dry
again
while
the
breeze
was
cool
and
sweet
smelling
of
wet
foliage
and
bringing
sunshine
and
shade
in
frequent
and
very
pleasing
alternation
there
was
a
walk
in
p√®re
jerome
little
garden
of
which
we
have
not
spoken
off
on
the
right
side
of
the
cottage
with
his
chamber
window
at
one
end
a
few
old
and
twisted
but
on
either
hand
now
and
then
a
rose
of
some
unpretending
variety
and
some
bunches
of
rue
and
at
the
other
end
a
shrine
in
whose
blue
niche
stood
a
small
figure
of
mary
with
folded
hands
and
uplifted
eyes
no
other
window
looked
down
upon
the
spot
and
its
seclusion
was
often
a
great
comfort
to
p√®re
jerome
up
and
down
this
path
but
a
few
steps
in
its
entire
length
the
priest
was
walking
taking
the
air
for
a
few
moments
after
a
prolonged
sitting
in
the
confessional
penitents
had
been
numerous
this
afternoon
he
was
thinking
of
ursin
the
officers
of
the
government
had
not
found
him
nor
had
p√®re
jerome
seen
him
yet
he
believed
they
had
in
a
certain
indirect
way
devised
a
simple
project
by
which
they
could
at
any
time
figs
dad
law
providing
only
that
these
government
officials
would
give
over
their
search
for
though
he
had
not
seen
the
fugitive
madame
delphine
had
seen
him
and
had
been
the
vehicle
of
communication
between
them
there
was
an
where
a
was
wont
to
sing
and
a
girl
in
white
to
walk
that
the
detectives
wot
not
of
the
law
was
to
be
figs
by
the
departure
of
the
three
frequenters
of
the
garden
in
one
ship
to
france
where
the
law
offered
no
obstacles
it
seemed
moderately
certain
to
those
in
search
of
monsieur
vignevielle
and
it
was
true
that
jean
and
evariste
were
his
harborers
but
for
all
that
the
hunt
even
for
clues
was
vain
the
little
banking
establishment
had
not
been
disturbed
jean
thompson
had
told
the
searchers
certain
facts
about
it
and
about
its
gentle
proprietor
as
well
that
persuaded
them
to
make
no
move
against
the
concern
if
the
same
relations
did
not
even
induce
a
relaxation
of
their
efforts
for
his
personal
discovery
p√®re
jerome
was
walking
to
and
fro
with
his
hands
behind
him
pondering
these
matters
he
had
paused
a
moment
at
the
end
of
the
walk
furthest
from
his
window
and
was
looking
around
upon
the
sky
when
turning
he
beheld
a
closely
veiled
female
figure
standing
at
the
other
end
and
knew
instantly
that
it
was
olive
she
came
forward
quickly
and
with
evident
eagerness
i
came
to
confession
she
said
breathing
hurriedly
the
excitement
in
her
eyes
shining
through
her
veil
but
i
find
i
am
too
late
there
is
no
too
late
or
too
early
for
that
i
am
always
ready
said
the
priest
but
how
is
your
mother
ah
her
voice
failed
more
trouble
ah
sir
i
have
trouble
oh
p√®re
jerome
i
am
bringing
so
much
trouble
upon
my
poor
mother
p√®re
jerome
moved
slowly
toward
the
house
with
his
eyes
cast
down
the
veiled
girl
at
his
side
it
is
not
your
fault
he
presently
said
and
after
another
pause
i
thought
it
was
all
arranged
he
looked
up
and
could
see
even
through
the
veil
her
crimson
blush
oh
no
she
replied
in
a
low
despairing
voice
dropping
her
face
what
is
the
difficulty
asked
the
priest
stopping
in
the
angle
of
the
path
where
it
turned
toward
the
front
of
the
house
she
averted
her
face
and
began
picking
the
thin
scales
of
bark
from
a
madame
thompson
and
her
husband
were
at
our
house
this
morning
had
told
monsieur
thompson
all
about
it
they
were
very
kind
to
me
at
first
but
they
tried
she
was
weeping
what
did
they
try
to
do
asked
the
priest
they
tried
to
make
me
believe
he
is
insane
she
succeeded
in
passing
her
handkerchief
up
under
her
veil
and
i
suppose
then
your
poor
mother
grew
angry
eh
yes
and
they
became
much
more
so
and
said
if
we
did
not
write
or
send
a
writing
to
within
hours
breaking
the
engagement
said
p√®re
jerome
they
would
give
him
up
to
the
government
oh
p√®re
jerome
what
shall
i
do
it
is
killing
my
mother
she
bowed
her
head
and
sobbed
where
is
your
mother
now
she
has
gone
to
see
monsieur
jean
thompson
she
says
she
has
a
plan
that
will
match
them
all
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
i
begged
her
not
to
go
but
oh
sir
crazy
and
i
am
no
better
my
poor
child
said
p√®re
jerome
what
you
seem
to
want
is
not
absolution
but
relief
from
persecution
oh
father
i
have
committed
mortal
sin
i
am
guilty
of
pride
and
anger
nevertheless
said
the
priest

he
was
in
the
street
himself
chapter

by
an
oath
p√®re
jerome
pausing
on
a
in
the
last
hour
of
sunlight
had
wiped
his
brow
and
taken
his
cane
down
from
under
his
arm
to
start
again
when
somebody
coming
noiselessly
from
he
knew
not
where
asked
so
suddenly
as
to
startle
him
commin

how
do
they
call
this
street
here
it
was
by
the
bonnet
and
dress
disordered
though
they
were
rather
than
by
the
haggard
face
which
looked
distractedly
around
that
he
recognized
the
woman
to
whom
he
replied
in
her
own
it
is
the
rue
burgundy
where
are
you
going
madame

she
almost
leaped
from

replied
jerking
herself
half
around
away
one
foot
planted
forward
with
an
air
of
excited
preoccupation

now
every
minute

precious
he
could
not
withstand
her
look
of
entreaty
come
he
said
and
they
went
jean
thompson
and
doctor
varrillat
lived
opposite
each
other
on
the
bayou
road
a
little
way
beyond
the
town
limits
as
then
prescribed
each
had
his
large
house
among
the
magnolias
his
huge
overshadowing
either
corner
of
the
darkly
shaded
garden
his
broad
brick
walk
leading
down
to
the
tall
gate
his
square
of
bright
red
pavement
on
the
sidewalk
and
his
railed
platform
spanning
the
with
a
pair
of
green
benches
one
on
each
edge
facing
each
other
crosswise
of
the
gutter
there
any
sunset
hour
you
were
sure
to
find
the
householder
sitting
beside
his
matron
two
or
three
slave
nurses
in
white
turbans
standing
at
hand
and
an
excited
throng
of
fair
children
nearly
all
of
a
size
sometimes
at
a
beckon
or
call
the
parents
on
one
side
of
the
way
would
join
those
on
the
other
and
the
children
and
nurses
of
both
families
would
be
given
the
liberty
of
the
opposite
platform
and
an
fund
generally
the
parents
chose
the
thompson
platform
its
outlook
being
more
toward
the
sunset
such
happened
to
be
the
arrangement
this
afternoon
the
two
husbands
sat
on
one
bench
and
their
wives
on
the
other
both
pairs
very
quiet
waiting
respectfully
for
the
day
to
die
and
exchanging
only
occasional
comments
on
matters
of
light
moment
as
they
passed
through
the
memory
during
one
term
of
silence
madame
varrillat
a
pale
but
lady
touched
madame
thompson
a
person
of
two
and
a
half
times
her
weight
on
her
extensive
and
snowy
bare
elbow
directing
her
attention
obliquely
up
and
across
the
road
about
a
hundred
yards
distant
in
the
direction
of
the
river
was
a
long
pleasantly
shaded
green
strip
of
turf
destined
in
time
for
a
sidewalk
it
had
a
deep
ditch
on
the
nearer
side
and
a
fence
of
rough
cypress
palisades
on
the
farther
and
these
were
overhung
on
the
one
hand
by
a
row
of
bitter
inside
the
inclosure
and
on
the
other
by
a
line
of
slanting
along
the
outer
edge
of
the
ditch
down
this
cool
avenue
two
figures
were
approaching
side
by
side
they
had
first
attracted
madame
varrillat
notice
by
the
bright
play
of
sunbeams
which
as
they
walked
fell
upon
them
in
soft
golden
flashes
through
the
chinks
between
the
palisades
madame
thompson
elevated
a
pair
of
glasses
which
were
no
detraction
from
her
very
good
looks
and
remarked
with
the
serenity
of
a
reconnoitering
general
jerome
et
cette
all
eyes
were
bent
toward
them
she
walks
like
a
man
said
madame
varrillat
in
the
language
with
which
the
conversation
had
opened
no
said
the
physician
like
a
woman
in
a
state
of
high
nervous
excitement
jean
thompson
kept
his
eyes
on
the
woman
and
said
she
must
not
forget
to
walk
like
a
woman
in
the
state
of
louisiana
as
near
as
the
pun
can
be
translated
the
company
laughed
jean
thompson
looked
at
his
wife
whose
applause
he
prized
and
she
answered
by
an
asseverative
toss
of
the
head
leaning
back
and
contriving
with
some
effort
to
get
her
arms
folded
her
laugh
was
musical
and
low
but
enough
to
make
the
folded
arms
shake
gently
up
and
down
p√®re
jerome
is
talking
to
her
said
one
the
priest
was
at
that
moment
endeavoring
in
the
interest
of
peace
to
say
a
good
word
for
the
four
people
who
sat
watching
his
approach
it
was
in
the
old
strain
blame
them
one
part
madame
delphine
and
their
fathers
mothers
brothers
and
the
other
but
to
everything
she
had
the
one
amiable
answer
which
p√®re
jerome
ignored
i
am
going
to
arrange
it
to
satisfy
everybody
all
together
√†
they
are
coming
here
said
madame
varrillat
half
articulately
well
of
course
murmured
another
and
the
four
rose
up
smiling
courteously
the
doctor
and
attorney
advancing
and
shaking
hands
with
the
priest
no
p√®re
jerome
thanked
them
he
could
not
sit
down
this
i
believe
you
know
jean
is
madame
delphine
the
quadroone
curtsied
a
friend
of
mine
he
added
smiling
kindly
upon
her
and
turning
with
something
imperative
in
his
eye
to
the
group
she
says
she
has
an
important
private
matter
to
communicate
to
me
asked
jean
thompson
to
all
of
you
so
i
will
he
responded
nothing
to
the
expressions
of
regret
but
turned
to
madame
delphine
she
murmured
something
ah
yes
certainly
he
addressed
the
company
she
wishes
me
to
speak
for
her
veracity
it
is
unimpeachable
well
he
shook
hands
and
departed
the
four
resumed
their
seats
and
turned
their
eyes
upon
the
standing
figure
have
you
something
to
say
to
us
asked
jean
thompson
frowning
at
her
bonnet
replied
the
woman
shrinking
to
one
side
and
laying
hold
of
one
of
the
benches
oul√©

she
attempted
to
fan
herself
her
face
turned
away
from
the
attorney
and
her
eyes
rested
on
the
ground
take
a
seat
said
doctor
varrillat
with
some
suddenness
starting
from
his
place
and
gently
guiding
her
sinking
form
into
the
corner
of
the
bench
the
ladies
rose
up
somebody
had
to
stand
the
two
races
could
not
both
sit
down
at
once
at
least
not
in
that
public
manner
your

said
the
physician
to
his
wife
she
handed
the
vial
madame
delphine
stood
up
again
we
will
all
go
inside
said
madame
thompson
and
they
passed
through
the
gate
and
up
the
walk
mounted
the
steps
and
entered
the
deep
cool
madame
thompson
herself
bade
the
quadroone
be
seated
well
said
jean
thompson
as
the
rest
took
chairs
it
funny
said
madame
delphine
with
a
piteous
effort
to
smile
that
nobody
thought
of
it
it
is
so
plain
you
have
only
to
look
and
see
i
mean
about
olive
she
loosed
a
button
in
the
front
of
her
dress
and
passed
her
hand
into
her
bosom
and
yet
olive
herself
never
thought
of
it
she
does
not
know
a
word
the
hand
came
out
holding
a
miniature
madame
varrillat
passed
it
to
jean
thompson
so
said
madame
delphine
that
is
her
father
it
went
from
one
to
another
exciting
admiration
and
murmured
praise
she
is
the
image
of
him
said
madame
thompson
in
an
austere
returning
it
to
her
husband
doctor
varrillat
was
watching
madame
delphine
she
was
very
pale
she
had
passed
a
trembling
hand
into
a
pocket
of
her
skirt
and
now
drew
out
another
picture
in
a
case
the
counterpart
of
the
first
he
reached
out
for
it
and
she
handed
it
to
him
he
looked
at
it
a
moment
when
his
eyes
suddenly
lighted
up
and
he
passed
it
to
the
attorney
madame
delphine
utterance
failed
l√†
ouala
sa
that
is
her
mother
the
three
others
instantly
gathered
around
jean
thompson
chair
they
were
much
impressed
it
is
true
beyond
a
doubt
muttered
madame
thompson
madame
varrillat
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
the
proof
is
right
there
in
the
faces
said
madame
thompson
yes
yes
said
madame
delphine
excitedly
the
proof
is
there
you
do
not
want
any
better
i
am
willing
to
swear
to
it
but
you
want
no
better
proof
that
is
all
anybody
could
want
my
god
you
can
not
help
but
see
it
her
manner
was
wild
jean
thompson
looked
at
her
sternly
nevertheless
you
say
you
are
willing
to
take
your
solemn
oath
to
this
certainly
you
will
have
to
do
it
certainly
mich√©
thompson
i
shall
you
will
make
out
the
paper
and
i
will
swear
before
god
that
it
is
true
only
turning
to
the
ladies
do
not
tell
olive
she
will
never
believe
it
it
will
break
her
heart
it
a
servant
came
and
spoke
privately
to
madame
thompson
who
rose
quickly
and
went
to
the
hall
madame
delphine
continued
rising
unconsciously
you
see
i
have
had
her
with
me
from
a
baby
she
knows
no
better
he
brought
her
to
me
only
two
months
old
her
mother
had
died
in
the
ship
coming
out
here
he
did
not
come
straight
from
home
here
his
people
never
knew
he
was
married
the
speaker
looked
around
suddenly
with
a
startled
glance
there
was
a
noise
of
excited
speaking
in
the
hall
it
is
not
true
madame
thompson
cried
a
girl
voice
madame
delphine
look
became
one
of
wildest
distress
and
alarm
and
she
opened
her
lips
in
a
vain
attempt
to
utter
some
request
when
olive
appeared
a
moment
in
the
door
and
then
flew
into
her
arms
my
mother
my
mother
my
mother
madame
thompson
with
tears
in
her
eyes
tenderly
drew
them
apart
and
let
madame
delphine
down
into
her
chair
while
olive
threw
herself
upon
her
knees
continuing
to
cry
oh
my
mother
say
you
are
my
mother
madame
delphine
looked
an
instant
into
the
upturned
face
and
then
turned
her
own
away
with
a
long
low
cry
of
pain
looked
again
and
laying
both
hands
upon
the
suppliant
head
said
ch√®re
piti
√†
moin
to
pa
ma
fie
oh
my
darling
little
one
you
are
not
my
daughter
her
eyes
closed
and
her
head
sank
back
the
two
gentlemen
sprang
to
her
assistance
and
laid
her
upon
a
sofa
unconscious
when
they
brought
her
to
herself
olive
was
kneeling
at
her
head
silently
weeping
ch√®re
said
the
girl
softly
kissing
her
lips
courri
i
will
go
home
said
the
mother
drearily
you
will
go
home
with
me
said
madame
varrillat
with
great
kindness
of
manner
just
across
the
street
here
i
will
take
care
of
you
till
you
feel
better
and
olive
will
stay
here
with
madame
thompson
you
will
be
only
the
width
of
the
street
apart
but
madame
delphine
would
go
nowhere
but
to
her
home
olive
she
would
not
allow
to
go
with
her
then
they
wanted
to
send
a
servant
or
two
to
sleep
in
the
house
with
her
for
aid
and
protection
but
all
she
would
accept
was
the
transient
service
of
a
messenger
to
invite
two
of
her
kinspeople
man
and
wife
to
come
and
make
their
dwelling
with
her
in
course
of
time
these
two
a
poor
timid
helpless
pair
fell
heir
to
the
premises
their
children
had
it
after
them
but
whether
in
those
hands
or
these
the
house
had
its
habits
and
continued
in
them
and
to
this
day
the
neighbors
as
has
already
been
said
rightly
explain
its
uninhabited
look
by
the
statement
that
the
inmates

eleison
the
second
saturday
afternoon
following
was
hot
and
calm
the
lamp
burning
before
the
tabernacle
in
p√®re
jerome
little
church
might
have
hung
with
as
motionless
a
flame
in
the
window
behind
the
lilies
of
joseph
wand
shining
in
one
of
the
half
opened
panes
were
not
more
completely
at
rest
than
the
leaves
on
tree
and
vine
without
suspended
in
the
slumbering
air
almost
as
still
down
under
the
with
a
single
band
of
light
falling
athwart
his
box
from
a
small
door
which
stood
ajar
sat
the
little
priest
behind
the
lattice
of
the
confessional
silently
wiping
away
the
sweat
that
beaded
on
his
brow
and
rolled
down
his
face
at
distant
intervals
the
shadow
of
some
one
entering
softly
through
the
door
would
obscure
for
a
moment
the
band
of
light
and
an
aged
crone
or
a
little
boy
or
some
gentle
presence
that
the
listening
confessor
had
known
only
by
the
voice
for
many
years
would
kneel
a
few
moments
beside
his
waiting
ear
in
prayer
for
blessing
and
in
review
of
those
slips
and
errors
which
prove
us
all
akin
the
day
had
been
long
and
fatiguing
first
early
mass
a
hasty
meal
then
a
business
call
upon
the
archbishop
in
the
interest
of
some
projected
charity
then
back
to
his
cottage
and
so
to
the
of
vignevielle
in
the
rue
toulouse
there
all
was
open
bright
and
its
master
virtually
though
not
actually
present
the
search
was
over
and
the
seekers
gone
personally
wiser
than
they
would
tell
and
officially
reporting
that
to
the
best
of
their
knowledge
and
belief
based
on
evidence
and
especially
on
the
assurances
of
an
unexceptionable
eyewitness
to
wit
monsieur
vignevielle
banker
capitaine
lemaitre
was
dead
and
buried
at
noon
there
had
been
a
wedding
in
the
little
church
its
scenes
lingered
before
p√®re
jerome
vision
now
the
kneeling
pair
the
bridegroom
rich
in
all
the
excellences
of
man
strength
and
kindness
slumbering
interlocked
in
every
part
and
feature
the
bride
a
saintly
weariness
on
her
pale
face
her
awesome
eyes
lifted
in
adoration
upon
the
image
of
the
saviour
the
small
knots
of
friends
behind
madame
thompson
large
fair
jean
thompson
with
the
affidavit
of
madame

showing
through
his
tightly
buttoned
coat
the
physician
and

sharing
one
expression
of
amiable
consent
and
last
yet
first
one
small
shrinking
female
figure
here
at
one
side
in
faded
robes
and
dingy
bonnet
she
sat
as
motionless
as
stone
yet
wore
a
look
of
apprehension
and
in
the
small
restless
black
eyes
which
peered
out
from
the
pinched
and
wasted
face
betrayed
the
peacelessness
of
a
harrowed
mind
and
neither
the
recollection
of
bride
nor
of
groom
nor
of
potential
friends
behind
nor
the
occupation
of
the
present
hour
could
shut
out
from
the
tired
priest
the
image
of
that
woman
or
the
sound
of
his
own
low
words
of
invitation
to
her
given
as
the
company
left
the
church
come
to
confession
this
afternoon
by
and
by
a
long
time
passed
without
the
approach
of
any
step
or
any
glancing
of
light
or
shadow
save
for
the
occasional
progress
from
station
to
station
of
some
one
over
on
the
right
who
was
noiselessly
going
the
way
of
the
cross
yet
p√®re
jerome
tarried
she
will
surely
come
he
said
to
himself
she
promised
she
would
come
a
moment
later
his
sense
quickened
by
the
prolonged
silence
caught
a
subtle
evidence
or
two
of
approach
and
the
next
moment
a
penitent
knelt
noiselessly
at
the
window
of
his
box
and
the
whisper
came
tremblingly
in
the
voice
he
had
waited
to
hear
mo
p√®re
que
mo
bless
me
father
for
i
have
sinned
he
gave
his
blessing
amen
murmured
the
penitent
and
then
in
the
soft
accents
of
the
creole
continued
confess
to
almighty
god
to
the
blessed
mary
ever
virgin
to
blessed
michael
the
archangel
to
blessed
john
the
baptist
to
the
holy
apostles
peter
and
paul
and
to
all
the
saints
that
i
have
sinned
exceedingly
in
thought
word
and
deed
my
fault
through
my
fault
through
my
most
grievous
i
confessed
on
saturday
three
weeks
ago
and
received
absolution
and
i
have
performed
the
penance
enjoined
since
then
there
she
stopped
there
was
a
soft
stir
as
if
she
sank
slowly
down
and
another
as
if
she
rose
up
again
and
in
a
moment
she
said
olive
my
child
the
picture
i
showed
to
jean
thompson
is
the
of
my
daughter
father
dead
before
my
child
was
born
she
is
the
image
of
her
and
of
him
but
o
god
thou
knowest
oh
olive
my
own
daughter
she
ceased
and
was
still
p√®re
jerome
waited
but
no
sound
came
he
looked
through
the
window
she
was
kneeling
with
her
forehead
resting
on
her
arms
motionless
he
repeated
the
words
of
absolution
still
she
did
not
stir
my
daughter
he
said
go
to
thy
home
in
peace
but
she
did
not
move
he
rose
hastily
stepped
from
the
box
raised
her
in
his
arms
and
called
her
by
name
madame
delphine
her
head
fell
back
in
his
elbow
for
an
instant
there
was
life
in
the
eyes
it
glimmered
it
vanished
and
tears
gushed
from
his
own
and
fell
upon
the
gentle
face
of
the
dead
as
he
looked
up
to
heaven
and
cried
lord
lay
not
this
sin
to
her
charge
