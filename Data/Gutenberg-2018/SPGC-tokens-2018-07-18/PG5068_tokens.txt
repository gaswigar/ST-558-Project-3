on
being
human
woodrow
wilson
president
of
the
united
states
from
the
atlantic
monthly
on
being
human
i
the
rarest
sort
of
a
book
says
bagehot
slyly
is
a
book
to
read
and
the
knack
in
style
is
to
write
like
a
human
being
it
is
painfully
evident
upon
experiment
that
not
many
of
the
books
which
come
teeming
from
our
presses
every
year
are
meant
to
be
read
they
are
meant
it
may
be
to
be
pondered
it
is
hoped
no
doubt
they
may
instruct
or
inform
or
startle
or
arouse
or
reform
or
provoke
or
amuse
us
but
we
read
if
we
have
the
true
reader
zest
and
plate
not
to
grow
more
knowing
but
to
be
less
pent
up
and
bound
within
a
little
circle
as
those
who
take
their
pleasure
and
not
as
those
who
laboriously
seek
instruction
as
a
means
of
seeing
and
enjoying
the
world
of
men
and
affairs
we
wish
companionship
and
renewal
of
spirit
enrichment
of
thought
and
the
full
adventure
of
the
mind
and
we
desire
fair
company
and
a
larger
world
in
which
to
find
them
no
one
who
loves
the
masters
who
may
be
communed
with
and
read
but
must
see
therefore
and
resent
the
error
of
making
the
text
of
any
one
of
them
a
source
to
draw
grammar
from
forcing
the
parts
of
speech
to
stand
out
stark
and
cold
from
the
warm
text
or
a
store
of
samples
whence
to
draw
rhetorical
instances
setting
up
figures
of
speech
singly
and
without
support
of
any
neighbor
phrase
to
be
stared
at
curiously
and
with
intent
to
copy
or
dissect
here
is
grammar
done
without
deliberation
the
phrases
carry
their
meaning
simply
and
by
a
sort
of
limpid
reflection
the
thought
is
a
living
thing
not
an
image
ingeniously
contrived
and
wrought
pray
leave
the
text
whole
it
has
no
meaning
piecemeal
at
any
rate
not
that
best
wholesome
meaning
as
of
a
frank
and
genial
friend
who
talks
not
for
himself
or
for
his
phrase
but
for
you
it
is
questionable
morals
to
dismember
a
living
frame
to
seek
for
its
obscure
fountains
of
life
when
you
say
that
a
book
was
meant
to
be
read
you
mean
for
one
thing
of
course
that
it
was
not
meant
to
be
studied
you
do
not
study
a
good
story
or
a
haunting
poem
or
a
battle
song
or
a
love
ballad
or
any
moving
narrative
whether
it
be
out
of
history
or
out
of
fiction
nor
any
argument
even
that
moves
vital
in
the
field
of
action
you
do
not
have
to
study
these
things
they
reveal
themselves
you
do
not
stay
to
see
how
they
remain
with
you
and
will
not
be
forgotten
or
laid
by
they
cling
like
a
personal
experience
and
become
the
mind
intimates
you
devour
a
book
meant
to
be
read
not
because
you
would
fill
yourself
or
have
an
anxious
care
to
be
nourished
but
because
it
contains
such
stuff
as
it
makes
the
mind
hungry
to
look
upon
neither
do
you
read
it
to
kill
time
but
to
lengthen
time
rather
adding
to
its
natural
usury
by
living
the
more
abundantly
while
it
lasts
joining
another
life
and
thought
to
your
own
there
are
a
few
children
in
every
generation
as
bagehot
reminds
us
who
think
the
natural
thing
to
do
with
any
book
is
to
read
it
there
is
an
argument
from
design
in
the
subject
as
he
says
if
the
book
was
not
meant
to
be
read
for
that
purpose
for
what
purpose
was
it
meant
these
are
the
young
eyes
to
which
books
yield
up
great
treasure
almost
in
spite
of
themselves
as
if
they
had
been
penetrated
by
some
swift
enlarging
power
of
vision
which
only
the
young
know
it
is
these
youngsters
to
whom
books
give
up
the
long
ages
of
history
the
wonderful
series
going
back
to
the
times
of
old
patriarchs
with
their
flocks
and
herds
i
am
quoting
bagehot
again
the
greek
the
stately
roman
the
watching
jew
the
uncouth
goth
the
horrid
hun
the
settled
picture
of
the
unchanging
east
the
restless
shifting
of
the
rapid
west
the
rise
of
the
cold
and
classical
civilization
its
fall
the
rough
impetuous
middle
ages
the
vague
warm
picture
of
ourselves
and
home
when
did
we
learn
these
not
yesterday
nor
today
but
long
ago
in
the
first
dawn
of
reason
in
the
original
flow
of
fancy
books
will
not
yield
to
us
so
richly
when
we
are
older
the
argument
from
design
fails
we
return
to
the
staid
authors
we
read
long
ago
and
do
not
find
in
them
the
vital
speaking
images
that
used
to
lie
there
upon
the
page
our
own
fancy
is
gone
and
the
author
never
had
any
we
are
driven
in
upon
the
books
meant
to
be
read
these
are
books
written
by
human
beings
indeed
but
with
no
general
quality
belonging
to
the
kind
with
a
special
tone
and
temper
rather
a
spirit
out
of
the
common
touched
with
a
light
that
shines
clear
out
of
some
great
source
of
light
which
not
every
man
can
uncover
we
call
this
spirit
human
because
it
moves
us
quickens
a
like
life
in
ourselves
makes
us
glow
with
a
sort
of
ardor
of
it
touches
the
springs
of
fancy
or
of
action
within
us
and
makes
our
own
life
seem
more
quick
and
vital
we
do
not
call
every
book
that
moves
us
human
some
seem
written
with
knowledge
of
the
black
art
set
our
base
passions
aflame
disclose
motives
at
which
we
shudder
the
more
because
we
feel
their
reality
and
power
and
we
know
that
this
is
of
the
devil
and
not
the
fruitage
of
any
quality
that
distinguishes
us
as
men
we
are
distinguished
as
men
by
the
qualities
that
mark
us
different
from
the
beasts
when
we
call
a
thing
human
we
have
a
spiritual
ideal
in
mind
it
may
not
be
an
ideal
of
that
which
is
perfect
but
it
moves
at
least
upon
an
upland
level
where
the
air
is
sweet
it
holds
an
image
of
man
erect
and
constant
going
abroad
with
undaunted
steps
looking
with
frank
and
open
gaze
upon
all
the
fortunes
of
his
day
feeling
even
and
again
the
joy
of
elevated
thoughts
a
sense
sublime
of
something
far
more
deeply
interfused
whose
dwelling
is
the
light
of
setting
suns
and
the
round
ocean
and
the
living
air
and
the
blue
sky
and
in
the
mind
of
man
a
motion
and
a
spirit
that
impels
all
thinking
things
say
what
we
may
of
the
errors
and
the
degrading
sins
of
our
kind
we
do
not
willingly
make
what
is
worst
in
us
the
distinguishing
trait
of
what
is
human
when
we
declare
with
bagehot
that
the
author
whom
we
love
writes
like
a
human
being
we
are
not
sneering
at
him
we
do
not
say
it
with
a
leer
it
is
in
token
of
admiration
rather
he
makes
us
like
our
humankind
there
is
a
noble
passion
in
what
he
says
a
wholesome
humor
that
echoes
genial
comradeships
a
certain
reasonableness
and
moderation
in
what
is
thought
and
said
an
air
of
the
open
day
in
which
things
are
seen
whole
and
in
their
right
colors
rather
than
of
the
close
study
or
the
academic
we
do
not
want
our
poetry
from
grammarians
nor
our
tales
from
philologists
nor
our
history
from
theorists
their
human
nature
is
subtly
transmuted
into
something
less
broad
and
catholic
and
of
the
general
world
neither
do
we
want
our
political
economy
from
tradesmen
nor
our
statesmanship
from
mere
politicians
but
from
those
who
see
more
and
care
for
more
than
these
men
see
or
care
for
ii
once
it
is
a
thought
which
troubles
us
once
it
was
a
simple
enough
matter
to
be
a
human
being
but
now
it
is
deeply
difficult
because
life
was
once
simple
but
is
now
complex
confused
multifarious
haste
anxiety
preoccupation
the
need
to
specialize
and
make
machines
of
ourselves
have
transformed
the
once
simple
world
and
we
are
apprised
that
it
will
not
be
without
effort
that
we
shall
keep
the
broad
human
traits
which
have
so
far
made
the
earth
habitable
we
have
seen
our
modern
life
accumulate
hot
and
restless
in
great
cities
and
we
can
not
say
that
the
change
is
not
natural
we
see
in
it
on
the
contrary
the
fulfillment
of
an
inevitable
law
of
change
which
is
no
doubt
a
law
of
growth
and
not
of
decay
and
yet
we
look
upon
the
portentous
thing
with
a
great
distaste
and
doubt
with
what
altered
passions
we
shall
come
out
of
it
the
huge
rushing
aggregate
life
of
a
great
city
the
crushing
crowds
in
the
streets
where
friends
seldom
meet
and
there
are
few
greetings
the
thunderous
noise
of
trade
and
industry
that
speaks
of
nothing
but
gain
and
competition
and
a
consuming
fever
that
checks
the
natural
courses
of
the
kindly
blood
no
leisure
anywhere
no
quiet
no
restful
ease
no
wise
repose
all
this
shocks
us
it
is
inhumane
it
does
not
seem
human
how
much
more
likely
does
it
appear
that
we
shall
find
men
sane
and
human
about
a
country
fireside
upon
the
streets
of
quiet
villages
where
all
are
neighbors
where
groups
of
friends
gather
easily
and
a
constant
sympathy
makes
the
very
air
seem
native
why
should
not
the
city
seem
infinitely
more
human
than
the
hamlet
why
should
not
human
traits
the
more
abound
where
human
beings
teem
millions
strong
because
the
city
curtails
man
of
his
wholeness
specializes
him
quickens
some
powers
stunts
others
gives
him
a
sharp
edge
and
a
temper
like
that
of
steel
makes
him
unfit
for
nothing
so
much
as
to
sit
still
men
have
indeed
written
like
human
beings
in
the
midst
of
great
cities
but
not
often
when
they
have
shared
the
city
characteristic
life
its
struggle
for
place
and
for
gain
there
are
not
many
places
that
belong
to
a
city
life
to
which
you
can
invite
your
soul
its
haste
its
preoccupations
its
anxieties
its
rushing
noise
as
of
men
driven
its
ringing
cries
distract
you
it
offers
no
quiet
for
reflection
it
permits
no
retirement
to
any
who
share
its
life
it
is
a
place
of
little
tasks
of
narrowed
functions
of
aggregate
and
not
of
individual
strength
the
great
machine
dominates
its
little
parts
and
its
society
is
as
much
of
a
machine
as
its
business
this
tract
which
the
river
of
time
now
flows
through
with
us
is
the
plain
gone
is
the
calm
of
its
earlier
shore
border
by
cities
and
hoarse
with
a
thousand
cries
is
its
stream
and
we
on
its
breasts
our
minds
are
confused
as
the
cries
which
we
hear
changing
and
sot
as
the
sights
which
we
see
and
we
say
that
repose
has
fled
forever
the
course
of
the
river
of
time
that
cities
will
crowd
to
its
edge
in
a
blacker
incessanter
line
that
the
din
will
be
more
on
its
banks
denser
the
trade
on
its
stream
flatter
the
plain
where
it
flows
fiercer
the
sun
overhead
that
never
will
those
on
its
breast
see
an
enobling
sight
drink
of
the
feeling
of
quiet
again
but
what
was
before
us
we
know
not
and
we
know
not
what
shall
succeed
haply
the
river
of
time
as
it
grows
as
the
towns
on
its
marge
fling
their
wavering
lights
on
a
wider
statelier
stream
may
acquire
if
not
the
calm
of
its
early
mountainous
shore
yet
a
solemn
peace
of
its
own
and
the
width
of
the
waters
the
hush
of
the
gray
expanse
where
he
floats
freshening
its
current
and
spotted
with
foam
as
it
draws
to
the
ocean
may
strike
peace
to
the
soul
of
the
man
on
its
breast
as
the
pale
waste
widens
around
him
as
the
banks
fade
dinner
away
as
the
stars
come
out
and
the
brings
up
the
stream
murmurs
and
scents
of
the
infinite
sea
we
can
not
easily
see
the
large
measure
and
abiding
purpose
of
the
novel
age
in
which
we
stand
young
and
confused
the
view
that
shall
clear
our
minds
and
quicken
us
to
act
as
those
who
know
their
task
and
its
distant
consummation
will
come
with
better
knowledge
and
completer
it
shall
not
be
a
but
an
air
that
shall
blow
out
of
the
widening
east
and
with
the
coming
of
the
light
and
shall
bring
us
with
the
morning
murmurs
and
scents
of
the
infinite
sea
who
can
doubt
that
man
has
grown
more
and
more
human
with
each
step
of
that
slow
process
which
has
brought
him
knowledge
the
arts
of
intercourse
and
the
revelations
of
real
joy
man
has
more
and
more
lived
with
his
and
it
is
society
that
has
humanized
him
the
development
of
society
into
a
infinitely
various
school
of
discipline
and
ordered
skill
he
has
been
made
more
human
by
schooling
by
growing
more
less
violent
less
tumultuous
holding
himself
in
hand
and
moving
always
with
a
certain
poise
of
spirit
not
forever
clapping
his
hand
to
the
hilt
of
his
sword
but
preferring
rather
to
play
with
a
subtler
skill
upon
the
springs
of
action
this
is
our
conception
of
the
truly
human
man
a
man
in
whom
there
is
a
just
balance
of
faculties
a
catholic
sympathy
no
brawler
no
fanatic
no
pharisee
not
too
credulous
in
hope
not
too
desperate
in
purpose
warm
but
not
hasty
ardent
and
full
of
definite
power
but
not
running
about
to
be
pleased
and
deceived
by
every
new
thing
it
is
a
genial
image
of
men
we
love
an
image
of
men
warm
and
true
of
heart
direct
and
unhesitating
in
courage
generous
magnanimous
faithful
steadfast
capable
of
a
deep
devotion
and
but
the
age
changes
and
with
it
must
change
our
ideals
of
human
quality
not
that
we
would
give
up
what
we
have
loved
we
would
add
what
a
new
life
demands
in
a
new
age
men
must
acquire
a
new
capacity
must
be
men
upon
a
new
scale
and
with
added
qualities
we
shall
need
a
new
renaissance
ushered
in
by
a
new
humanistic
movement
in
which
we
shall
add
our
present
minute
introspective
study
of
ourselves
our
jails
our
slums
our
nervecenters
our
shifts
to
live
almost
as
morbid
as
medieval
religion
a
rediscovery
of
the
round
world
and
of
man
place
in
it
now
that
its
face
has
changed
we
study
the
world
but
not
yet
with
intent
to
school
our
hearts
and
tastes
broaden
our
natures
and
know
our
as
comrades
rather
than
as
phenomena
with
purpose
rather
to
build
up
bodies
of
critical
doctrine
and
provide
ourselves
with
theses
that
surely
is
not
the
truly
humanizing
way
in
which
to
take
the
air
of
the
world
man
is
much
more
than
a
rational
being
and
lives
more
by
sympathies
and
impressions
than
by
conclusions
it
darkens
his
eyes
and
dries
up
the
wells
of
his
humanity
to
be
forever
in
search
of
doctrine
we
need
wholesome
experiencing
natures
i
dare
affirm
much
more
than
we
need
sound
reasoning
iii
take
life
in
the
large
view
and
we
are
most
reasonable
when
we
seek
that
which
is
most
wholesome
and
tonic
for
our
natures
as
a
whole
and
we
know
when
we
put
aside
pedantry
that
the
great
middle
object
in
life
the
object
that
lies
between
religion
on
one
hand
and
food
and
clothing
on
the
other
establishing
our
average
levels
of
achievement
the
excellent
golden
mean
is
not
to
be
learned
but
to
be
human
beings
in
all
the
wide
and
genial
meaning
of
the
term
does
the
age
hinder
do
its
many
interests
distract
us
when
we
would
plan
our
discipline
determine
our
duty
clarify
our
ideals
it
is
the
more
necessary
that
we
should
ask
ourselves
what
it
is
that
is
demanded
of
us
if
we
would
fit
our
qualities
to
meet
the
new
tests
let
us
remind
ourselves
that
to
be
human
is
for
one
thing
to
speak
and
act
with
a
certain
note
of
gentleness
a
quality
mixed
of
spontaneity
and
intelligence
this
is
necessary
for
wholesome
life
in
any
age
but
particularly
amidst
confused
affairs
and
shifting
standards
genuineness
is
not
mere
simplicity
for
that
may
lack
vitality
and
genuineness
does
not
we
expect
what
we
call
genuine
to
have
pith
and
strength
of
fiber
genuineness
is
a
quality
which
we
sometimes
mean
to
include
when
we
speak
of
individuality
individuality
is
lost
the
moment
you
submit
to
passing
modes
or
fashions
the
creations
of
an
artificial
society
and
so
is
genuineness
no
man
is
genuine
who
is
forever
trying
to
pattern
his
life
after
the
lives
of
other
people
unless
indeed
he
be
a
genuine
dolt
but
individuality
is
by
no
means
the
same
as
genuineness
for
individuality
may
be
associated
with
the
most
extreme
and
even
ridiculous
eccentricity
while
genuineness
we
conceive
to
be
always
wholesome
balanced
and
touched
with
dignity
it
is
a
quality
that
goes
with
good
sense
and
it
is
a
sort
of
robust
moral
sanity
mixed
of
elements
both
moral
and
intellectual
it
is
found
in
natures
too
strong
to
be
mere
trimmers
and
conformers
too
well
poised
and
thoughtful
to
fling
off
into
intemperate
protest
and
revolt
laughter
is
genuine
which
has
in
it
neither
the
shrill
hysterical
note
of
mere
excitement
nor
the
hard
metallic
twang
of
the
cynic
sneer
which
rings
in
the
honest
voice
of
gracious
good
humor
which
is
innocent
and
unsatirical
speech
is
genuine
which
is
without
silliness
affectation
or
pretense
that
character
is
genuine
which
seems
built
by
nature
rather
than
by
convention
which
is
stuff
of
independence
and
of
good
courage
nothing
spurious
bastard
begotten
out
of
true
wedlock
of
the
mind
nothing
adulterated
and
seeming
to
be
what
it
is
not
nothing
unreal
can
ever
get
place
among
the
nobility
of
things
genuine
natural
of
pure
stock
and
unmistakable
lineage
it
is
a
prerogative
of
every
truly
human
being
to
come
out
from
the
low
estate
of
those
who
are
merely
gregarious
and
of
the
herd
and
show
his
innate
powers
cultivated
and
yet
unspoiled
sound
unmixed
free
from
imitation
showing
that
individualization
without
extravagance
which
is
genuineness
but
how
by
what
means
is
this
to
be
effected
this
emancipation
from
affection
and
the
bondage
of
being
like
other
people
is
it
open
to
us
to
choose
to
be
genuine
i
see
nothing
insuperable
in
the
way
except
for
those
who
are
hopelessly
lacking
in
a
sense
of
humor
it
depends
upon
the
range
and
scale
of
your
observation
whether
you
can
strike
the
balance
of
genuineness
or
not
if
you
live
in
a
small
and
petty
world
you
will
be
subject
to
its
standards
but
if
you
live
in
a
large
world
you
will
see
that
standards
are
innumerable
some
old
some
new
some
made
by
the
and
made
to
last
some
made
by
the
and
destined
to
perish
some
lasting
from
age
to
age
some
only
from
day
to
day
and
that
a
choice
must
be
made
among
them
it
is
then
that
your
sense
of
humor
will
assist
you
you
are
you
will
perceive
upon
a
long
journey
and
it
will
seem
to
you
ridiculous
to
change
your
life
and
discipline
your
instincts
to
conform
with
the
usages
of
a
single
inn
by
the
way
you
will
distinguish
the
essentials
from
the
accidents
and
deem
the
accidents
something
meant
for
your
amusement
the
strongest
natures
do
not
need
to
wait
for
these
slow
lessons
of
observation
to
be
got
by
conning
life
their
sheer
vigor
makes
it
impossible
for
them
to
conform
to
fashion
or
care
for
times
and
seasons
but
the
rest
of
us
must
cultivate
knowledge
of
the
world
in
the
large
get
our
offing
reaching
a
comparative
point
of
view
before
we
can
become
with
steady
confidence
our
own
masters
and
pilots
the
art
of
being
humans
begins
with
the
practice
of
being
genuine
and
following
standards
of
conduct
which
the
world
has
tested
if
your
life
is
not
various
and
you
can
not
know
the
best
people
who
set
the
standards
of
sincerity
your
reading
at
least
can
be
various
and
you
may
look
at
your
little
circle
through
the
best
books
under
the
guidance
of
writers
who
have
known
life
and
loved
the
truth
iv
and
then
genuineness
will
bring
serenity
which
i
take
to
be
another
mark
of
the
right
development
of
the
true
human
being
certainly
in
an
age
passionate
and
confused
as
this
in
which
we
live
of
course
serenity
does
not
always
go
with
genuineness
we
must
say
of
johnson
that
he
was
genuine
and
yet
we
know
that
the
stormy
tyrant
of
the
turk
head
tavern
was
not
serene
carlyle
was
genuine
though
that
is
not
quite
the
first
adjective
we
should
choose
to
describe
him
but
of
serenity
he
allowed
cooks
and
cocks
and
every
modern
and
every
ancient
sham
to
deprive
him
serenity
is
a
product
no
doubt
of
two
very
different
things
namely
vision
and
digestion
not
the
eye
only
but
the
courses
of
the
blood
must
be
clear
if
we
would
find
serenity
our
word
serene
contains
a
picture
its
image
is
of
the
calm
evening
when
the
stars
are
out
and
the
still
night
comes
on
when
the
dew
is
on
the
grass
and
the
wind
does
not
stir
when
the
day
work
is
over
and
the
evening
meal
and
thought
falls
clear
in
the
quiet
hour
it
is
the
hour
of
reflection
and
it
is
human
to
reflect
who
shall
contrive
to
be
human
without
this
evening
hour
which
drives
turmoil
out
and
gives
the
soul
its
seasons
of
serenity
is
not
a
thing
to
beget
inaction
it
only
checks
excitement
and
uncalculating
haste
it
does
not
exclude
ardor
or
the
heat
of
battle
it
keeps
ardor
from
extravagance
prevents
the
battle
from
becoming
a
mere
aimless
melee
the
great
captains
of
the
world
have
been
men
who
were
calm
in
the
moment
of
crisis
who
were
calm
too
in
the
long
planning
which
preceded
crisis
who
went
into
battle
with
a
serenity
infinitely
ominous
for
those
whom
they
attack
we
instinctively
associate
serenity
with
the
highest
types
of
power
among
men
seeing
in
it
the
poise
of
knowledge
and
calm
vision
the
supreme
heat
and
mastery
which
is
without
splutter
or
noise
of
any
kind
the
art
of
power
in
this
sort
is
no
doubt
learned
in
hours
of
reflection
by
those
who
are
not
born
with
it
what
rebuke
of
aimless
excitement
there
is
to
be
got
out
of
a
little
reflection
when
we
have
been
inveighing
against
the
corruption
and
decadence
of
our
own
days
if
only
we
have
provided
ourselves
with
a
little
knowledge
of
the
past
wherewith
to
balance
our
thought
as
bad
times
as
these
or
any
we
shall
see
have
been
reformed
but
not
by
protests
they
have
been
made
glorious
instead
of
shameful
by
the
men
who
kept
their
heads
and
struck
with
sure
in
the
fight
the
world
is
very
human
not
a
bit
given
to
adopting
virtues
for
the
sakes
of
those
who
merely
bemoan
its
vices
and
we
are
most
effective
when
we
are
most
calmly
in
possession
of
our
senses
so
far
is
serenity
from
being
a
thing
of
slackness
or
inaction
that
it
seems
bred
rather
by
an
equable
energy
a
satisfying
activity
it
may
be
found
in
the
midst
of
that
alert
interest
in
affairs
which
is
it
may
be
the
distinguishing
trait
of
developed
manhood
you
distinguish
man
from
the
brute
by
his
intelligent
curiosity
his
play
of
mind
beyond
the
narrow
field
of
instinct
his
perception
of
cause
and
effect
in
matters
to
him
indifferent
his
appreciation
of
motive
and
calculation
of
results
he
is
interested
in
the
world
about
him
and
even
in
the
great
universe
of
which
it
forms
a
part
not
merely
as
a
thing
he
would
use
satisfy
his
wants
and
grow
great
by
but
as
a
field
to
stretch
his
mind
in
for
love
of
journeyings
and
excursions
in
the
large
realm
of
thought
your
human
being
loves
a
run
afield
with
his
understanding
with
what
images
does
he
not
surround
himself
and
store
his
mind
with
what
fondness
does
he
con
travelers
tales
and
credit
poets
fancies
with
what
patience
does
he
follow
science
and
pore
upon
old
records
and
with
what
eagerness
does
he
ask
the
news
of
the
day
no
great
part
of
what
he
learns
immediately
touches
his
own
life
or
the
course
of
his
own
affairs
he
is
not
pursuing
a
business
but
satisfying
as
he
can
an
insatiable
mind
no
doubt
the
highest
form
of
this
noble
curiosity
is
that
which
leads
us
without
to
look
abroad
upon
all
the
field
of
man
life
at
home
and
in
society
seeking
more
excellent
forms
of
government
more
righteous
ways
of
labor
more
elevating
forms
of
art
and
which
makes
the
greater
among
us
statesmen
reformers
philanthropists
artists
critics
men
of
letters
it
is
certainly
human
to
mind
your
neighbor
business
as
well
as
your
own
gossips
are
only
sociologists
upon
a
mean
and
petty
scale
the
art
of
being
human
lifts
to
be
a
better
level
than
that
of
gossip
it
leaves
mere
chatter
behind
as
too
reminiscent
of
a
lower
stage
of
existence
and
is
compassed
by
those
whose
outlook
is
wide
enough
to
serve
for
guidance
and
a
choosing
of
ways
v
luckily
we
are
not
the
first
human
beings
we
have
come
into
a
great
heritage
of
interesting
things
collected
and
piled
all
about
us
by
the
curiousity
of
past
generations
and
so
our
interest
is
selective
our
education
consists
in
learning
intelligent
choice
our
energies
do
not
clash
or
compete
each
is
free
to
take
his
own
path
to
knowledge
each
has
that
choice
which
is
man
alone
of
the
life
he
shall
live
and
finds
out
first
or
last
that
the
art
in
living
is
not
only
to
be
genuine
and
one
own
master
but
also
to
learn
mastery
in
perception
and
preference
your
true
woodsman
needs
not
to
follow
the
dusty
highway
through
the
forest
nor
search
for
any
path
but
goes
straight
from
glade
to
glade
as
if
upon
an
open
way
having
some
privy
understanding
with
the
taller
trees
some
compass
in
his
senses
so
there
is
the
subtle
craft
in
finding
ways
for
the
mind
too
keep
but
your
eyes
alert
and
your
ears
quick
as
you
move
among
men
and
among
books
and
you
shall
find
yourself
possessed
at
last
of
a
new
sense
the
sense
of
the
pathfinder
have
you
never
marked
the
eyes
of
a
man
who
has
seen
the
world
he
has
lived
in
the
eyes
of
the
who
has
watched
his
life
through
the
changes
of
the
heavens
the
eyes
of
the
huntsman
nature
gossip
and
familiar
the
eyes
of
the
man
of
affairs
accustomed
to
command
in
moments
of
exigency
you
are
at
once
aware
that
they
are
eyes
which
can
see
there
is
something
in
them
that
you
do
not
find
in
other
eyes
and
you
have
read
the
life
of
the
man
when
you
have
divined
what
it
is
let
the
thing
serve
as
a
figure
so
ought
alert
interest
in
the
world
of
men
and
thought
to
serve
each
one
of
us
that
we
shall
have
the
quick
perceiving
vision
taking
meanings
at
a
glance
reading
suggestions
as
if
they
were
expositions
you
shall
not
otherwise
get
full
value
of
your
humanity
what
good
shall
it
do
you
else
that
the
long
generations
of
men
which
have
gone
before
have
filled
the
world
with
great
store
of
everything
that
may
make
you
wise
and
your
life
various
will
you
not
take
the
usury
of
the
past
if
it
may
be
had
for
the
taking
here
is
the
world
humanity
has
made
will
you
take
full
citizenship
in
it
or
will
you
live
in
it
as
dull
as
slow
to
receive
as
unenfranchised
as
the
idlers
for
whom
civilization
has
no
uses
or
the
deadened
toilers
men
or
beasts
whose
labor
shuts
the
door
on
choice
that
man
seems
to
me
a
little
less
than
human
who
lives
as
if
our
life
in
the
world
were
but
just
begun
thinking
only
of
the
things
of
sense
recking
nothing
of
the
infinite
thronging
and
assemblage
of
affairs
the
great
stage
over
or
of
the
old
wisdom
that
has
ruled
the
world
that
is
if
he
have
the
choice
great
masses
of
our
are
shut
out
from
choosing
by
reason
of
absorbing
toil
and
it
is
part
of
the
enlightenment
of
our
age
that
our
understandings
are
being
opened
to
the
workingman
need
of
a
little
leisure
wherein
to
look
about
him
and
clear
his
vision
of
the
dust
of
the
workshop
we
know
that
there
is
a
drudgery
which
is
inhuman
let
it
but
encompass
the
whole
life
with
only
heavy
sleep
between
task
and
task
we
know
that
those
who
are
so
bound
can
have
no
freedom
to
be
men
that
their
very
spirits
are
in
bondage
it
is
part
of
our
philanthropy
it
should
be
part
of
our
statesmanship
to
ease
the
burden
as
we
can
and
enfranchise
those
who
spend
and
are
spent
for
the
sustenance
of
the
race
but
what
shall
we
say
of
those
who
are
free
and
yet
choose
littleness
and
bondage
or
of
those
who
though
they
might
see
the
whole
face
of
society
nevertheless
choose
to
spend
all
a
life
space
poring
upon
some
single
vice
or
blemish
i
would
not
for
the
world
discredit
any
sort
of
philanthropy
except
the
small
and
churlish
sort
which
seeks
to
reform
by
nagging
the
sort
which
exaggerates
petty
vices
into
great
ones
and
runs
atilt
against
windmills
while
everywhere
colossal
shams
and
abuses
go
unexposed
unrebuked
is
it
because
we
are
better
at
being
common
scolds
than
at
being
wise
advisers
that
we
prefer
little
reforms
to
big
ones
are
we
to
allow
the
poor
personal
habits
of
other
people
to
absorb
and
quite
use
up
all
our
fine
indignation
it
will
be
a
bad
day
for
society
when
sentimentalists
are
encouraged
to
suggest
all
the
measures
that
shall
be
taken
for
the
betterment
of
the
race
i
for
one
sometimes
sigh
for
the
generation
of
leading
people
and
of
good
people
who
shall
see
things
steadily
and
see
them
whole
who
shall
show
a
handsome
justness
and
a
large
sanity
of
view
an
opportune
tolerance
for
details
that
happen
to
be
awry
in
order
that
they
may
spend
their
energy
not
without
in
some
generous
mission
which
shall
make
right
principles
shine
upon
the
people
life
they
would
bring
with
them
an
age
of
large
moralities
a
spacious
time
a
day
of
vision
knowledge
has
come
into
the
world
in
vain
if
it
is
not
to
emancipate
those
who
may
have
it
from
narrowness
censoriousness
fussiness
an
intemperate
zeal
for
petty
things
it
would
be
a
most
pleasant
a
truly
humane
world
would
we
but
open
our
ears
with
a
more
generous
welcome
to
the
clear
voices
that
ring
in
those
writings
upon
life
and
affairs
which
mankind
has
chosen
to
keep
not
many
splenetic
books
not
many
intemperate
not
many
bigoted
have
kept
men
confidence
and
the
mind
that
is
impatient
or
intolerant
or
hoodwinked
or
shut
in
to
a
petty
view
shall
have
no
part
in
carrying
men
forward
to
a
true
humanity
shall
never
stand
as
examples
of
the
true
humankind
what
is
truly
human
has
always
upon
it
the
broad
light
of
what
is
genial
fit
to
support
life
cordial
and
of
a
catholic
spirit
of
helpfulness
your
true
human
being
has
eyes
and
keeps
his
balance
in
the
world
deems
nothing
uninteresting
that
comes
from
life
clarifies
his
vision
and
gives
health
to
his
eyes
by
using
them
upon
things
near
and
things
far
the
brute
beast
has
but
a
single
neighborhood
a
single
narrow
round
of
existence
the
gain
of
being
human
accrues
in
the
choice
of
change
and
variety
and
of
experience
far
and
wide
with
all
the
world
for
stage
a
stage
set
and
appointed
by
this
very
art
of
choice
all
future
generations
for
witnesses
and
audience
when
you
talk
with
a
man
who
has
in
his
nature
and
acquirements
that
freedom
from
constraint
which
goes
with
the
full
franchise
of
humanity
he
turns
easily
with
topic
to
topic
does
not
fall
silent
or
dull
when
you
leave
some
single
field
of
thought
such
as
unwise
men
make
a
prison
of
the
men
who
will
not
be
broken
from
a
little
set
of
subjects
who
talk
earnestly
hotly
with
a
sort
of
fierceness
of
certain
special
schemes
of
conduct
and
look
coldly
upon
everything
else
render
you
infinitely
uneasy
as
if
there
were
in
them
a
force
abnormal
and
which
rocked
toward
an
upset
of
the
mind
but
from
the
man
whose
interest
swings
from
thought
to
thought
with
the
zest
and
poise
and
pleasure
of
the
old
traveler
eager
for
what
is
new
glad
to
look
again
upon
what
is
old
you
come
away
with
faculties
warmed
and
heartened
with
the
feeling
of
having
been
comrade
for
a
little
with
a
genuine
human
being
it
is
a
large
world
and
a
round
world
and
men
grow
human
by
seeing
all
its
play
of
force
and
folly
vi
let
no
one
suppose
that
efficiency
is
lost
by
such
breadth
and
catholicity
of
view
we
deceive
ourselves
with
instances
look
at
sharp
crises
in
the
world
affairs
and
imagine
that
intense
and
narrow
men
have
made
history
for
us
poise
balance
a
nice
and
equable
exercise
of
force
are
not
it
is
true
the
things
the
world
ordinarily
seeks
for
or
most
applauds
in
its
heroes
it
is
apt
to
esteem
that
man
most
human
who
has
his
qualities
in
a
certain
exaggeration
whose
courage
is
passionate
whose
generosity
is
without
deliberation
whose
just
action
is
without
premeditation
whose
spirit
runs
toward
its
favorite
objects
with
an
infectious
and
reckless
ardor
whose
wisdom
is
no
child
of
slow
prudence
we
love
achilles
more
than
diomedes
and
ulysses
not
at
all
but
these
are
standards
left
over
from
a
ruder
state
of
society
we
should
have
passed
by
this
time
the
homeric
stage
of
mind
should
have
heroes
suited
to
our
age
nay
we
have
erected
different
standards
and
do
make
a
different
choice
when
we
see
in
any
man
fulfillment
of
our
real
ideals
let
a
modern
instance
serve
as
test
could
any
man
hesitate
to
say
that
abraham
lincoln
was
more
human
than
william
lloyd
garrison
does
not
every
one
know
that
it
was
the
practical
who
made
emancipation
possible
and
not
the
hot
impracticable
abolitionists
that
the
country
was
infinitely
more
moved
by
lincoln
temperate
sagacity
than
by
any
man
enthusiasm
instinctively
trusted
the
man
who
saw
the
whole
situation
and
kept
his
balance
instinctively
held
off
from
those
who
refused
to
see
more
than
one
thing
we
know
how
serviceable
the
intense
and
headlong
agitator
was
in
bringing
to
their
feet
men
fit
for
action
but
we
feel
uneasy
while
he
lives
and
vouchsafe
him
our
full
sympathy
only
when
he
is
dead
we
know
that
the
genial
forces
of
nature
which
work
daily
equably
and
without
violence
are
infinitely
more
serviceable
infinitely
more
admirable
than
the
rude
violence
of
the
storm
however
necessary
or
excellent
the
purification
it
may
have
wrought
should
we
seek
to
name
the
most
human
man
among
those
who
let
the
nation
to
its
struggle
with
slavery
and
yet
was
no
statesmen
we
should
of
course
name
lowell
we
know
that
his
humor
went
further
than
any
man
passion
toward
setting
tolerant
men
atingle
with
the
new
impulses
of
the
day
we
naturally
hold
back
from
those
who
are
intemperate
and
can
never
stop
to
smile
and
are
deeply
reassured
to
see
a
twinkle
in
a
reformer
eye
we
are
glad
to
see
earnest
men
laugh
it
breaks
the
strain
if
it
be
wholesome
laughter
it
dispels
all
suspicion
of
spite
and
is
like
the
gleam
of
light
upon
running
water
lifting
sullen
shadows
suggesting
clear
depths
surely
it
is
this
soundness
of
nature
this
broad
and
genial
quality
this
sanity
of
spirit
which
gives
the
men
we
love
that
sympathy
which
gives
hope
and
power
to
humanity
which
gives
range
to
every
good
quality
and
is
so
excellent
a
credential
of
genuine
manhood
let
your
life
and
your
thought
be
narrow
and
your
sympathy
will
shrink
to
a
like
scale
it
is
a
quality
which
follows
the
seeing
mind
afield
which
waits
on
experience
it
is
not
a
mere
sentiment
it
goes
not
with
pity
so
much
as
with
a
penetrative
understanding
of
other
men
lives
and
hopes
and
temptations
ignorance
of
these
things
makes
it
worthless
its
best
tutors
are
observations
and
experience
and
these
serve
only
those
who
keep
clear
eyes
and
a
wide
field
of
vision
it
is
exercise
and
discipline
upon
such
a
scale
too
which
strengthen
which
for
ordinary
men
come
near
to
creating
that
capacity
to
reason
upon
affairs
and
to
plan
for
action
which
we
always
reckon
upon
finding
in
every
man
who
has
studied
to
perfect
his
native
force
this
new
day
in
which
we
live
cries
a
challenge
to
us
steam
and
electricity
have
reduced
nations
to
neighborhoods
have
made
travel
pastime
and
news
a
thing
for
everybody
cheap
printing
has
made
knowledge
a
vulgar
commodity
our
eyes
look
almost
without
choice
upon
the
very
world
itself
and
the
word
human
is
filled
with
new
meaning
our
ideals
broaden
to
suit
the
wide
day
in
which
we
live
we
crave
not
cloistered
virtue
it
is
impossible
any
longer
to
keep
the
cloister
but
a
robust
spirit
that
shall
take
the
air
in
the
great
world
know
men
in
all
their
kinds
choose
its
way
amid
the
bustle
with
all
with
wise
genuineness
in
calmness
and
yet
with
the
quick
eye
of
interest
and
the
quick
pulse
of
power
it
is
again
a
day
for
shakespeare
spirit
a
day
more
various
more
ardent
more
provoking
to
valor
and
every
large
design
even
than
the
spacious
times
of
great
elizabeth
when
all
the
world
seemed
new
and
if
we
can
not
find
another
bard
come
out
of
a
new
warwickshire
to
hold
once
more
the
mirror
up
to
nature
it
will
not
be
because
the
stage
is
not
set
for
him
the
time
is
such
an
one
as
he
might
rejoice
to
look
upon
and
if
we
would
serve
it
as
it
should
be
served
we
should
seek
to
be
human
after
his
sort
the
serenity
of
power
the
naturalness
that
is
nature
poise
and
mark
of
genuineness
the
unsleeping
interest
in
all
affairs
all
fancies
all
things
believed
or
done
the
catholic
understanding
tolerance
enjoyment
of
all
classes
and
conditions
of
men
the
conceiving
imagination
the
planning
purpose
the
creating
thought
the
wholesome
laughing
humor
the
quiet
insight
the
universal
coinage
of
the
brain
are
not
these
the
marvelous
gifts
and
qualities
we
mark
in
shakespeare
when
we
call
him
the
greatest
among
men
and
shall
not
these
rounded
and
perfect
powers
serve
us
as
our
ideal
of
what
it
is
to
be
a
finished
human
being
we
live
for
our
own
age
an
age
like
shakespeare
when
an
old
world
is
passing
away
a
new
world
coming
in
an
age
of
new
speculation
and
every
new
adventure
of
the
mind
a
full
stage
an
intricate
plot
a
universal
play
of
passion
an
outcome
no
man
can
foresee
it
is
to
this
world
this
sweep
of
action
that
our
understandings
must
be
stretched
and
fitted
it
is
in
this
age
we
must
show
our
human
quality
we
must
measure
ourselves
by
the
task
accept
the
pace
set
for
us
make
shift
to
know
what
we
are
about
how
free
and
liberal
should
be
the
scale
of
our
sympathy
how
catholic
our
understanding
of
the
world
in
which
we
live
how
poised
and
masterful
our
action
in
the
midst
of
so
great
affairs
we
should
school
our
ears
to
know
the
voices
that
are
genuine
our
thought
to
take
the
truth
when
it
is
spoken
our
spirits
to
feel
the
zest
of
the
day
it
is
within
our
choice
to
be
mean
company
or
with
great
to
consort
with
the
wise
or
with
the
foolish
now
that
the
great
world
has
spoken
to
us
in
the
literature
of
all
tongues
and
voices
the
best
selected
human
nature
will
tell
in
the
making
of
the
future
and
the
art
of
being
human
is
the
art
of
freedom
and
of
force
the
end
