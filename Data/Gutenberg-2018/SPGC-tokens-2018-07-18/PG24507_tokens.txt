preface
to
the
second
edition
as
mystical
was
the
title
given
by
the
author
to
this
work
when
eight
years
ago
he
gathered
into
it
the
substance
of
lectures
delivered
by
him
in
the
title
indicated
the
special
character
of
the
book
in
it
the
attempt
was
made
not
merely
to
represent
historically
the
mystical
content
of
christianity
but
to
describe
the
origin
of
christianity
from
the
standpoint
of
mystical
contemplation
underlying
this
intention
was
the
thought
that
at
the
genesis
of
christianity
mystical
facts
were
at
work
which
can
only
be
perceived
by
such
contemplation
it
is
only
the
book
itself
which
can
make
clear
that
by
mystical
its
author
does
not
imply
a
conception
which
relies
more
on
vague
feelings
than
on
strictly
scientific
statements
it
is
true
that
mysticism
is
at
present
widely
understood
in
the
former
sense
and
hence
it
is
declared
by
many
to
be
a
sphere
of
the
human
with
which
true
science
can
have
nothing
to
do
in
this
book
the
word
mysticism
is
used
in
the
sense
of
the
representation
of
a
spiritual
fact
which
can
only
be
recognised
in
its
true
nature
when
the
knowledge
of
it
is
derived
from
the
sources
of
spiritual
life
itself
if
the
kind
of
knowledge
drawn
from
such
sources
is
rejected
the
reader
will
not
be
in
a
position
to
judge
of
the
contents
of
this
book
only
one
who
allows
that
the
same
clearness
may
exist
in
mysticism
as
in
a
true
representation
of
the
facts
of
natural
science
will
be
ready
to
admit
that
the
content
of
christianity
as
mysticism
may
also
be
mystically
described
for
it
is
not
only
a
question
of
the
contents
of
the
book
but
first
and
foremost
of
the
methods
of
knowledge
by
means
of
which
the
statements
in
it
are
made
many
there
are
in
the
present
day
who
have
a
most
violent
dislike
to
such
methods
which
are
regarded
as
conflicting
with
the
ways
of
true
science
and
this
is
not
only
the
case
with
those
willing
to
admit
other
interpretations
of
the
world
than
their
own
on
the
ground
of
genuine
knowledge
of
natural
science
but
also
with
those
who
as
believers
wish
to
study
the
nature
of
christianity
the
author
of
this
book
stands
on
the
ground
of
a
conception
which
sees
that
the
achievements
of
natural
science
in
our
age
must
lead
up
into
true
mysticism
in
fact
any
other
attitude
as
regards
knowledge
actually
contradicts
everything
presented
by
the
achievements
of
natural
science
the
facts
of
natural
science
itself
indeed
can
not
be
comprehended
by
means
of
those
methods
of
knowledge
which
so
many
people
would
like
to
employ
to
the
exclusion
of
others
under
the
illusion
that
they
stand
on
the
firm
ground
of
natural
science
it
is
only
when
we
are
prepared
to
admit
that
a
full
appreciation
of
our
present
admirable
knowledge
of
nature
is
compatible
with
genuine
mysticism
that
we
can
take
the
contents
of
this
book
into
consideration
the
author
intention
is
to
show
by
means
of
what
is
here
called
mystical
knowledge
how
the
source
of
christianity
prepared
its
own
ground
in
the
mysteries
of
times
in
this
mysticism
we
find
the
soil
in
which
christianity
throve
as
a
germ
of
quite
independent
nature
this
point
of
view
makes
it
possible
to
understand
christianity
in
its
independent
being
even
though
its
evolution
is
traced
from
mysticism
if
this
point
of
view
be
overlooked
it
is
very
possible
to
misunderstand
that
independent
character
and
to
think
that
christianity
was
merely
a
further
development
of
what
already
existed
in
mysticism
many
people
of
the
present
day
have
fallen
into
this
error
comparing
the
content
of
christianity
with
conceptions
and
then
thinking
that
christian
ideas
were
only
a
continuation
of
the
former
the
following
pages
are
intended
to
show
that
christianity
presupposes
the
earlier
mysticism
just
as
a
seed
must
have
its
soil
it
is
intended
to
emphasise
the
peculiar
character
of
the
essence
of
christianity
through
the
knowledge
of
its
evolution
but
not
to
extinguish
it
it
is
with
deep
satisfaction
that
the
author
is
able
to
mention
that
this
account
of
the
nature
of
christianity
has
found
acceptance
with
a
writer
who
has
enriched
the
culture
of
our
time
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
by
his
important
works
on
the
spiritual
life
of
humanity
edouard
schuré
author
of
grands
is
so
far
in
accord
with
the
attitude
of
this
book
that
he
undertook
to
translate
it
into
french
under
the
title
mystère
chrétien
et
les
mystères
it
may
be
mentioned
by
the
way
and
as
a
symptom
of
the
existence
at
the
present
time
of
a
longing
to
understand
the
nature
of
christianity
as
presented
in
this
work
that
the
first
edition
was
translated
into
other
european
languages
besides
french
the
author
has
not
found
occasion
to
alter
anything
essential
in
the
preparation
of
this
second
edition
on
the
other
hand
what
was
written
eight
years
ago
has
been
enlarged
and
the
endeavour
has
been
made
to
express
many
things
more
exactly
and
circumstantially
than
was
then
possible
unfortunately
the
author
was
obliged
through
stress
of
work
to
let
a
long
period
elapse
between
the

points

natural
science
has
deeply
influenced
modern
thought
it
is
becoming
more
and
more
impossible
to
speak
of
spiritual
needs
and
the
life
of
the
soul
without
taking
into
consideration
the
achievements
and
methods
of
this
science
it
must
be
admitted
however
that
many
people
satisfy
these
needs
without
letting
themselves
be
troubled
by
its
influence
but
those
who
feel
the
beating
of
the
pulse
of
the
age
must
take
this
influence
into
consideration
with
increasing
swiftness
do
ideas
derived
from
natural
science
take
possession
of
our
brains
and
unwillingly
though
it
may
be
our
hearts
follow
often
in
dejection
and
dismay
it
is
not
a
question
only
of
the
number
thus
won
over
but
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
force
within
the
method
of
natural
science
which
convinces
the
attentive
observer
that
that
method
contains
something
which
can
not
be
neglected
and
is
one
by
which
any
modern
conception
of
the
universe
must
be
profoundly
affected
many
of
the
outgrowths
of
this
method
compel
a
justifiable
rejection
but
such
rejection
is
not
sufficient
in
an
age
in
which
very
many
resort
to
this
way
of
thinking
and
are
attracted
to
it
as
if
by
magic
the
case
is
in
no
way
altered
because
some
people
see
that
true
science
long
ago
passed
by
its
own
initiative
beyond
the
shallow
doctrines
of
force
and
matter
taught
by
materialists
it
would
be
better
apparently
to
listen
to
those
who
boldly
declare
that
the
ideas
of
natural
science
will
form
the
basis
of
a
new
religion
if
these
ideas
also
appear
shallow
and
superficial
to
one
who
knows
the
deeper
spiritual
needs
of
humanity
he
must
nevertheless
take
note
of
them
for
it
is
to
them
that
attention
is
now
turned
and
there
is
reason
to
think
they
will
claim
more
and
more
notice
in
the
near
future
another
class
of
people
have
also
to
be
taken
into
account
those
whose
hearts
have
lagged
behind
their
heads
with
their
reason
they
can
not
but
accept
the
ideas
of
natural
science
the
burden
of
proof
is
too
much
for
them
but
those
ideas
can
not
satisfy
the
religious
needs
of
their
souls
the
perspective
offered
is
too
dreary
is
the
human
soul
to
rise
on
the
wings
of
enthusiasm
to
the
heights
of
beauty
truth
and
goodness
only
for
each
individual
to
be
swept
away
in
the
end
like
a
bubble
blown
by
the
material
brain
this
is
a
feeling
which
oppresses
many
minds
like
a
nightmare
but
scientific
concepts
oppress
them
also
coming
as
they
do
come
with
the
mighty
force
of
authority
as
long
as
they
can
these
people
remain
blind
to
the
discord
in
their
souls
indeed
they
console
themselves
by
saying
that
full
clearness
in
these
matters
is
denied
to
the
human
soul
they
think
in
accordance
with
natural
science
so
long
as
the
experience
of
their
senses
and
the
logic
of
their
intellect
demand
it
but
they
keep
to
the
religious
sentiments
in
which
they
have
been
educated
and
prefer
to
remain
in
darkness
as
to
these
matters
a
darkness
which
clouds
their
understanding
they
have
not
the
courage
to
battle
through
to
the
light
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
habit
of
thought
derived
from
natural
science
is
the
greatest
force
in
modern
intellectual
life
and
it
must
not
be
passed
by
heedlessly
by
any
one
concerned
with
the
spiritual
interests
of
humanity
but
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
the
way
in
which
it
sets
about
satisfying
spiritual
needs
is
superficial
and
shallow
if
this
were
the
right
way
the
outlook
would
indeed
be
dreary
would
it
not
be
depressing
to
be
obliged
to
agree
with
those
who
say
thought
is
a
form
of
force
we
walk
by
means
of
the
same
force
by
which
we
think
man
is
an
organism
which
transforms
various
forms
of
force
into
an
organism
the
activity
of
which
we
maintain
by
what
we
call
and
with
which
we
produce
what
we
call
what
a
marvellous
chemical
process
it
is
which
could
change
a
certain
quantity
of
food
into
the
divine
tragedy
of
hamlet
this
is
quoted
from
a
pamphlet
of
robert
ingersoll
bearing
the
title
twilight
of
the
it
matters
little
if
such
thoughts
find
but
scanty
acceptance
in
the
outside
world
the
point
is
that
innumerable
people
find
themselves
compelled
by
the
system
of
natural
science
to
take
up
with
regard
to
an
attitude
in
conformity
with
the
above
even
when
they
think
they
are
not
doing
so
it
would
certainly
be
a
dreary
outlook
if
natural
science
itself
compelled
us
to
accept
the
creed
proclaimed
by
many
of
its
modern
prophets
most
dreary
of
all
for
one
who
has
gained
from
the
content
of
natural
science
the
conviction
that
in
its
own
sphere
its
mode
of
thought
holds
good
and
its
methods
are
unassailable
for
he
is
driven
to
make
the
admission
that
however
much
people
may
dispute
about
individual
questions
though
volume
after
volume
may
be
written
and
thousands
of
observations
accumulated
about
the
struggle
for
existence
and
its
insignificance
about
the
omnipotence
or
powerlessness
of
natural
selection
natural
science
itself
is
moving
in
a
direction
which
within
certain
limits
must
find
acceptance
in
an
degree
but
are
the
demands
made
by
natural
science
really
such
as
they
are
described
by
some
of
its
representatives
that
they
are
not
so
is
proved
by
the
method
employed
by
these
representatives
themselves
the
method
they
use
in
their
own
sphere
is
not
such
as
is
often
described
and
claimed
for
other
spheres
of
thought
would
darwin
and
ernst
haeckel
ever
have
made
their
great
discoveries
about
the
evolution
of
life
if
instead
of
observing
life
and
the
structure
of
living
beings
they
had
shut
themselves
up
in
a
laboratory
and
there
made
chemical
experiments
with
tissue
cut
out
of
an
organism
would
lyell
have
been
able
to
describe
the
development
of
the
crust
of
the
earth
if
instead
of
examining
strata
and
their
contents
he
had
scrutinised
the
chemical
qualities
of
innumerable
rocks
let
us
really
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
these
investigators
who
tower
like
giants
in
the
domain
of
modern
science
we
shall
then
apply
to
the
higher
regions
of
spiritual
life
the
methods
they
have
used
in
the
study
of
nature
we
shall
not
then
believe
we
have
understood
the
nature
of
the
divine
tragedy
of
hamlet
by
saying
that
a
wonderful
chemical
process
transformed
a
certain
quantity
of
food
into
that
tragedy
we
shall
believe
it
as
little
as
an
investigator
of
nature
could
seriously
believe
that
he
has
understood
the
mission
of
heat
in
the
evolution
of
the
earth
when
he
has
studied
the
action
of
heat
on
sulphur
in
a
retort
neither
does
he
attempt
to
understand
the
construction
of
the
human
brain
by
examining
the
effect
of
liquid
potash
on
a
fragment
of
it
but
rather
by
inquiring
how
the
brain
has
in
the
course
of
evolution
been
developed
out
of
the
organs
of
lower
organisms
it
is
therefore
quite
true
that
one
who
is
investigating
the
nature
of
spirit
can
do
nothing
better
than
learn
from
natural
science
he
need
only
do
as
science
does
but
he
must
not
allow
himself
to
be
misled
by
what
individual
representatives
of
natural
science
would
dictate
to
him
he
must
investigate
in
the
spiritual
as
they
do
in
the
physical
domain
but
he
need
not
adopt
the
opinions
they
entertain
about
the
spiritual
world
confused
as
they
are
by
their
exclusive
contemplation
of
physical
phenomena
we
shall
only
be
acting
in
the
spirit
of
natural
science
if
we
study
the
spiritual
development
of
man
as
impartially
as
the
naturalist
observes
the
we
shall
then
certainly
be
led
in
the
domain
of
spiritual
life
to
a
kind
of
contemplation
which
differs
from
that
of
the
naturalist
as
geology
differs
from
pure
physics
and
biology
from
chemistry
we
shall
be
led
up
to
higher
methods
which
can
not
it
is
true
be
those
of
natural
science
though
quite
conformable
with
the
spirit
of
it
such
methods
alone
are
able
to
bring
us
to
the
heart
of
spiritual
developments
such
as
that
of
christianity
or
other
worlds
of
religious
conceptions
any
one
applying
these
methods
may
arouse
the
opposition
of
many
who
believe
they
are
thinking
scientifically
but
he
will
know
himself
for
all
that
to
be
in
full
accord
with
a
genuinely
scientific
method
of
thought
an
investigator
of
this
kind
must
also
go
beyond
a
merely
historical
examination
of
the
documents
relating
to
spiritual
life
this
is
necessary
just
on
account
of
the
attitude
he
has
acquired
from
his
study
of
natural
history
when
a
chemical
law
is
explained
it
is
of
small
use
to
describe
the
retorts
dishes
and
pincers
which
have
led
to
the
discovery
of
the
law
and
it
is
just
as
useless
when
explaining
the
origin
of
christianity
to
ascertain
the
historical
sources
drawn
upon
by
the
evangelist
luke
or
those
from
which
the
hidden
revelation
of
john
is
compiled
history
can
in
this
case
be
only
the
outer
court
to
research
proper
it
is
not
by
tracing
the
historical
origin
of
documents
that
we
shall
discover
anything
about
the
dominant
ideas
in
the
writings
of
moses
or
in
the
traditions
of
the
greek
mystics
these
documents
are
only
the
outer
expression
for
the
ideas
nor
does
the
naturalist
who
is
investigating
the
nature
of
man
trouble
about
the
origin
of
the
word
man
or
the
way
in
which
it
has
developed
in
a
language
he
keeps
to
the
thing
not
to
the
word
in
which
it
finds
expression
and
in
studying
spiritual
life
we
must
likewise
abide
by
the
spirit
and
not
by
outer
documents
ii
the
mysteries
and
their
wisdom
a
kind
of
mysterious
veil
hangs
over
the
manner
in
which
spiritual
needs
were
satisfied
during
the
older
civilisations
by
those
who
sought
a
deeper
religious
life
and
fuller
knowledge
than
the
popular
religions
offered
if
we
inquire
how
these
needs
were
satisfied
we
find
ourselves
led
into
the
dim
twilight
of
the
mysteries
and
the
individual
seeking
them
disappears
for
a
time
from
our
observation
we
see
how
it
is
that
the
popular
religions
can
not
give
him
what
his
heart
desires
he
acknowledges
the
existence
of
the
gods
but
knows
that
the
ordinary
ideas
about
them
do
not
solve
the
great
problems
of
existence
he
seeks
a
wisdom
which
is
jealously
guarded
by
a
community
of
his
aspiring
soul
seeks
a
refuge
in
this
community
if
he
is
found
by
the
sages
to
be
sufficiently
prepared
he
is
led
up
by
them
step
by
step
to
higher
knowledge
in
places
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
outward
observers
what
then
happens
to
him
is
concealed
from
the
uninitiated
he
seems
for
a
time
to
be
entirely
removed
from
earthly
life
and
to
be
transported
into
a
hidden
world
when
he
reappears
in
the
light
of
day
a
different
quite
transformed
person
is
before
us
we
see
a
man
who
can
not
find
words
sublime
enough
to
express
the
momentous
experience
through
which
he
has
passed
not
merely
metaphorically
but
in
a
most
real
sense
does
he
seem
to
have
gone
through
the
gate
of
death
and
to
have
awakened
to
a
new
and
higher
life
he
is
moreover
quite
certain
that
no
one
who
has
not
had
a
similar
experience
can
understand
his
words
this
was
what
happened
to
those
who
were
initiated
into
the
mysteries
into
that
secret
wisdom
withheld
from
the
people
and
which
threw
light
on
the
greatest
questions
this
secret
religion
of
the
elect
existed
side
by
side
with
the
popular
religion
its
origin
vanishes
as
far
as
history
is
concerned
into
the
obscurity
in
which
the
origin
of
nations
is
lost
we
find
this
secret
religion
everywhere
amongst
the
ancients
as
far
as
we
know
anything
concerning
them
and
we
hear
their
sages
speak
of
the
mysteries
with
the
greatest
reverence
what
was
it
that
was
concealed
in
them
and
what
did
they
unveil
to
the
initiate
the
enigma
becomes
still
more
puzzling
when
we
discover
that
the
ancients
looked
upon
the
mysteries
as
something
dangerous
the
way
leading
to
the
secrets
of
existence
passed
through
a
world
of
terrors
and
woe
to
him
who
tried
to
gain
them
unworthily
there
was
no
greater
crime
than
the
betrayal
of
secrets
to
the
uninitiated
the
traitor
was
punished
with
death
and
the
confiscation
of
his
property
we
know
that
the
poet
æschylus
was
accused
of
having
reproduced
on
the
stage
something
from
the
mysteries
he
was
only
able
to
escape
death
by
fleeing
to
the
altar
of
dionysos
and
by
legally
proving
that
he
had
never
been
initiated
what
the
ancients
say
about
these
secrets
is
significant
but
at
the
same
time
ambiguous
the
initiate
is
convinced
that
it
would
be
a
sin
to
tell
what
he
knows
and
also
that
it
would
be
sinful
for
the
uninitiated
to
listen
plutarch
speaks
of
the
terror
of
those
about
to
be
initiated
and
compares
their
state
of
mind
to
preparation
for
death
a
special
mode
of
life
had
to
precede
initiation
tending
to
give
the
spirit
the
mastery
over
the
senses
fasting
solitude
mortifications
and
certain
exercises
for
the
soul
were
the
means
employed
the
things
to
which
man
clings
in
ordinary
life
were
to
lose
all
their
value
for
him
the
whole
trend
of
his
life
of
sensation
and
feeling
was
to
be
changed
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
meaning
of
such
exercises
and
tests
the
wisdom
which
was
to
be
offered
to
the
candidate
for
initiation
could
only
produce
the
right
effect
upon
his
soul
if
he
had
previously
purified
the
lower
life
of
his
sensibility
he
was
introduced
to
the
life
of
the
spirit
he
was
to
behold
a
higher
world
but
he
could
not
enter
into
relations
with
that
world
without
previous
exercises
and
tests
the
relations
thus
gained
were
the
condition
of
initiation
in
order
to
obtain
a
correct
idea
on
this
matter
it
is
necessary
to
gain
experience
of
the
intimate
facts
of
the
growth
of
knowledge
we
must
feel
that
there
are
two
widely
divergent
attitudes
towards
that
which
the
highest
knowledge
gives
the
world
surrounding
us
is
to
us
at
first
the
real
one
we
feel
hear
and
see
what
goes
on
in
it
and
because
we
thus
perceive
things
with
our
senses
we
call
them
real
and
we
reflect
about
events
in
order
to
get
an
insight
into
their
connections
on
the
other
hand
what
wells
up
in
our
soul
is
at
first
not
real
to
us
in
the
same
sense
it
is
merely
thoughts
and
ideas
at
the
most
we
see
in
them
only
images
of
reality
they
themselves
have
no
reality
for
we
can
not
touch
see
or
hear
them
there
is
another
way
of
being
connected
with
things
a
person
who
clings
to
the
kind
of
reality
described
above
will
hardly
understand
it
but
it
comes
to
certain
people
at
some
moment
in
their
lives
to
them
the
whole
connection
with
the
world
is
completely
reversed
they
then
call
the
images
which
well
up
in
the
spiritual
life
of
their
souls
actually
real
and
they
assign
only
a
lower
kind
of
reality
to
what
the
senses
hear
touch
feel
and
see
they
know
that
they
can
not
prove
what
they
say
that
they
can
only
relate
their
new
experiences
and
that
when
relating
them
to
others
they
are
in
the
position
of
a
man
who
can
see
and
who
imparts
his
visual
impressions
to
one
born
blind
they
venture
to
impart
their
inner
experiences
trusting
that
there
are
others
round
them
whose
spiritual
eyes
though
as
yet
closed
may
be
opened
by
the
power
of
what
they
hear
for
they
have
faith
in
humanity
and
want
to
give
it
spiritual
sight
they
can
only
lay
before
it
the
fruits
which
their
spirit
has
gathered
whether
another
sees
them
depends
on
his
spiritual
eyes
being
opened
or
not
there
is
something
in
man
which
at
first
prevents
him
from
seeing
with
the
eyes
of
the
spirit
he
is
not
there
for
that
purpose
he
is
what
his
senses
are
and
his
intellect
is
only
the
interpreter
and
judge
of
them
the
senses
would
ill
fulfil
their
mission
if
they
did
not
insist
upon
the
truth
and
infallibility
of
their
evidence
an
eye
must
from
its
own
point
of
view
uphold
the
absolute
reality
of
its
perceptions
the
eye
is
right
as
far
as
it
goes
and
is
not
deprived
of
its
due
by
the
eye
of
the
spirit
the
latter
only
allows
us
to
see
the
things
of
sense
in
a
higher
light
nothing
seen
by
the
eye
of
sense
is
denied
but
a
new
brightness
hitherto
unseen
radiates
from
what
is
seen
and
then
we
know
that
what
we
first
saw
was
only
a
lower
reality
we
see
that
still
but
it
is
immersed
in
something
higher
which
is
spirit
it
is
now
a
question
of
whether
we
realise
and
feel
what
we
see
one
who
lives
only
in
the
sensations
and
feelings
of
the
senses
will
look
upon
impressions
of
higher
things
as
a
fata
morgana
or
mere
play
of
fancy
his
feelings
are
entirely
directed
towards
the
things
of
sense
he
grasps
emptiness
when
he
tries
to
lay
hold
of
spirit
forms
they
withdraw
from
him
when
he
gropes
after
them
they
are
just
mere
thoughts
he
thinks
them
but
does
not
live
in
them
they
are
images
less
real
to
him
than
fleeting
dreams
they
rise
up
like
bubbles
while
he
is
standing
in
his
reality
they
disappear
before
the
massive
solidly
built
reality
of
which
his
senses
tell
him
it
is
otherwise
with
one
whose
perceptions
and
feelings
with
regard
to
reality
have
changed
for
him
that
reality
has
lost
its
absolute
stability
and
value
his
senses
and
feelings
need
not
become
numbed
but
they
begin
to
be
doubtful
of
their
absolute
authority
they
leave
room
for
something
else
the
world
of
the
spirit
begins
to
animate
the
space
left
at
this
point
a
possibility
comes
in
which
may
prove
terrible
a
man
may
lose
his
sensations
and
feelings
of
outer
reality
without
finding
any
new
reality
opening
up
before
him
he
then
feels
himself
as
if
suspended
in
the
void
he
feels
as
if
he
were
dead
the
old
values
have
disappeared
and
no
new
ones
have
arisen
in
their
place
the
world
and
man
no
longer
exist
for
him
this
however
is
by
no
means
a
mere
possibility
it
happens
at
some
time
or
other
to
every
one
who
is
seeking
for
higher
knowledge
he
comes
to
a
point
at
which
the
spirit
represents
all
life
to
him
as
death
he
is
then
no
longer
in
the
world
but
under
it
in
the
nether
world
he
is
passing
through
hades
well
for
him
if
he
sink
not
happy
if
a
new
world
open
up
before
him
either
he
dwindles
away
or
he
appears
to
himself
transfigured
in
the
latter
case
he
beholds
a
new
sun
and
a
new
earth
the
whole
world
has
been
born
again
for
him
out
of
spiritual
fire
it
is
thus
that
the
initiates
describe
the
effect
of
the
mysteries
upon
them
menippus
relates
that
he
journeyed
to
babylon
in
order
to
be
taken
to
hades
and
to
be
brought
back
again
by
the
successors
of
zarathustra
he
says
that
he
swam
across
the
great
water
on
his
wanderings
and
that
he
passed
through
fire
and
ice
we
hear
that
the
mystics
were
terrified
by
a
flashing
sword
and
that
blood
flowed
we
understand
this
when
we
know
from
experience
the
point
of
transition
from
lower
to
higher
knowledge
we
then
feel
as
if
all
solid
matter
and
things
of
sense
had
dissolved
into
water
and
as
if
the
ground
were
cut
away
from
under
our
feet
everything
is
dead
which
we
felt
before
to
be
alive
the
spirit
has
passed
through
the
life
of
the
senses
as
a
sword
pierces
a
warm
body
we
have
seen
the
blood
of
flow
but
a
new
life
has
appeared
we
have
risen
from
the
the
orator
aristides
relates
this
i
thought
i
touched
the
god
and
felt
him
draw
near
and
i
was
then
between
waking
and
sleeping
my
spirit
was
so
light
that
no
one
who
is
not
initiated
can
speak
of
or
understand
it
this
new
existence
is
not
subject
to
the
laws
of
lower
life
growth
and
decay
no
longer
affect
it
one
may
say
much
about
the
eternal
but
words
of
one
who
has
not
been
through
hades
are
mere
sound
and
smoke
the
initiates
have
a
new
conception
of
life
and
death
now
for
the
first
time
do
they
feel
they
have
the
right
to
speak
about
immortality
they
know
that
one
who
speaks
of
it
without
having
been
initiated
talks
of
something
which
he
does
not
understand
the
uninitiated
attribute
immortality
only
to
something
which
is
subject
to
the
laws
of
growth
and
decay
the
mystics
however
did
not
merely
desire
to
gain
the
conviction
that
the
kernel
of
life
is
eternal
according
to
the
view
of
the
mysteries
such
a
conviction
would
be
quite
valueless
for
this
view
holds
that
the
eternal
is
not
present
as
a
living
reality
in
the
uninitiated
if
such
an
one
spoke
of
the
eternal
he
would
be
speaking
of
something
it
is
rather
the
eternal
itself
that
the
mystics
are
seeking
they
have
first
to
awaken
the
eternal
within
them
then
they
can
speak
of
it
hence
the
hard
saying
of
plato
is
quite
real
to
them
that
the
uninitiated
sinks
into
the
mire
and
that
only
one
who
has
passed
through
the
mystical
life
enters
eternity
it
is
only
in
this
sense
that
the
words
in
the
fragment
of
sophocles
can
be
understood
are
the
initiated
who
come
to
the
realm
of
the
shades
they
alone
have
life
there
for
others
there
is
only
misery
and
hardship
is
one
therefore
not
describing
dangers
when
speaking
of
the
mysteries
is
it
not
robbing
a
man
of
happiness
and
of
the
best
part
of
his
life
to
take
him
to
the
portals
of
the
terrible
is
the
responsibility
incurred
by
such
an
act
and
yet
ought
we
to
refuse
that
responsibility
these
were
the
questions
which
the
initiate
had
to
put
to
himself
he
was
of
opinion
that
his
knowledge
bore
the
same
relation
to
the
soul
of
the
people
as
light
does
to
darkness
but
innocent
happiness
dwells
in
that
darkness
and
the
mystics
were
of
opinion
that
that
happiness
should
not
be
sacrilegiously
interfered
with
for
what
would
have
happened
in
the
first
place
if
the
mystic
had
betrayed
his
secret
he
would
have
uttered
words
and
only
words
the
feelings
and
emotions
which
would
have
evoked
the
spirit
from
the
words
would
have
been
absent
to
do
this
preparation
exercises
tests
and
a
complete
change
in
the
life
of
sense
were
necessary
without
this
the
hearer
would
have
been
hurled
into
emptiness
and
nothingness
he
would
have
been
deprived
of
what
constituted
his
happiness
without
receiving
anything
in
exchange
one
may
also
say
that
one
could
take
nothing
away
from
him
for
mere
words
would
change
nothing
in
his
life
of
feeling
he
would
only
have
been
able
to
feel
and
experience
reality
through
his
senses
nothing
but
a
terrible
misgiving
fatal
to
life
would
be
given
him
this
could
only
be
construed
as
a
crime
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
is
like
a
hothouse
plant
which
must
be
cultivated
and
fostered
in
seclusion
any
one
bringing
it
into
the
atmosphere
of
everyday
ideas
brings
it
into
air
in
which
it
can
not
flourish
it
withers
away
to
nothing
before
the
caustic
verdict
of
modern
science
and
logic
let
us
therefore
divest
ourselves
for
a
time
of
the
education
we
gained
through
the
microscope
and
telescope
and
the
habit
of
thought
derived
from
natural
science
and
let
us
cleanse
our
clumsy
hands
which
have
been
too
busy
with
dissecting
and
experimenting
in
order
that
we
may
enter
the
pure
temple
of
the
mysteries
for
this
a
candid
and
unbiassed
attitude
of
mind
is
necessary
the
important
point
for
the
mystic
is
at
first
the
frame
of
mind
in
which
he
approaches
that
which
to
him
is
the
highest
the
answers
to
the
riddles
of
existence
just
in
our
day
when
only
gross
physical
science
is
recognised
as
containing
truth
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
in
the
highest
things
we
depend
upon
the
of
the
soul
knowledge
thereby
becomes
an
intimate
personal
concern
but
this
is
what
it
really
is
to
the
mystic
tell
some
one
the
solution
of
the
riddle
of
the
universe
give
it
him
the
mystic
will
find
it
to
be
nothing
but
empty
sound
if
the
personality
does
not
meet
the
solution
in
the
right
manner
the
solution
in
itself
is
nothing
it
vanishes
if
the
necessary
feeling
is
not
kindled
at
its
contact
a
divinity
approaches
you
it
is
either
everything
or
nothing
nothing
if
you
meet
it
in
the
frame
of
mind
with
which
you
confront
everyday
matters
everything
if
you
are
prepared
and
attuned
to
the
meeting
what
the
divinity
is
in
itself
is
a
matter
which
does
not
affect
you
the
important
point
for
you
is
whether
it
leaves
you
as
it
found
you
or
makes
another
man
of
you
but
this
depends
entirely
on
yourself
you
must
have
been
prepared
by
a
special
education
by
a
development
of
the
inmost
forces
of
your
personality
for
the
work
of
kindling
and
releasing
what
a
divinity
is
able
to
kindle
and
release
in
you
what
is
brought
to
you
depends
on
the
reception
you
give
to
it
plutarch
has
told
us
about
this
education
and
of
the
greeting
which
the
mystic
offers
the
divinity
approaching
him
for
the
god
as
it
were
greets
each
one
who
approaches
him
with
the
words
thyself
which
is
surely
no
worse
than
the
ordinary
greeting
then
we
answer
the
divinity
in
the
words
art
and
thus
we
affirm
that
the
true
primordial
and
only
adequate
greeting
for
him
is
to
declare
that
he
is
in
that
existence
we
really
have
no
part
here
for
every
mortal
being
situated
between
birth
and
destruction
merely
manifests
an
appearance
a
feeble
and
uncertain
image
of
itself
if
we
try
to
grasp
it
with
our
understanding
it
is
as
when
water
is
tightly
compressed
and
runs
over
merely
through
the
pressure
spoiling
what
it
touches
for
the
understanding
pursuing
a
too
definite
conception
of
each
being
that
is
subject
to
accidents
and
change
loses
its
way
now
in
the
origin
of
the
being
now
in
its
destruction
and
is
unable
to
apprehend
anything
lasting
or
really
existing
for
as
heraclitus
says
we
can
not
swim
twice
in
the
same
wave
neither
can
we
lay
hold
of
a
mortal
being
twice
in
the
same
state
for
through
the
violence
and
rapidity
of
movement
it
is
destroyed
and
recomposed
it
comes
into
being
and
again
decays
it
comes
and
goes
therefore
that
which
is
becoming
can
neither
attain
real
existence
because
growth
neither
ceases
nor
pauses
change
begins
in
the
germ
and
forms
an
embryo
then
there
appears
a
child
then
a
youth
a
man
and
an
old
man
the
first
beginnings
and
successive
ages
are
continually
annulled
by
the
ensuing
ones
hence
it
is
ridiculous
to
fear
one
death
when
we
have
already
died
in
so
many
ways
and
are
still
dying
for
as
heraclitus
says
not
only
is
the
death
of
fire
the
birth
of
air
and
the
death
of
air
the
birth
of
water
but
the
same
change
may
be
still
more
plainly
seen
in
man
the
strong
man
dies
when
he
becomes
old
the
youth
when
he
becomes
a
man
the
boy
on
becoming
a
youth
and
the
child
on
becoming
a
boy
what
existed
yesterday
dies
what
is
here
will
die
nothing
endures
or
is
a
unity
but
we
become
many
things
whilst
matter
wanders
around
one
image
one
common
form
for
if
we
were
always
the
same
how
could
we
take
pleasure
in
things
which
formerly
did
not
please
us
how
could
we
love
and
hate
admire
and
blame
opposite
things
how
could
we
speak
differently
and
give
ourselves
up
to
different
passions
unless
we
were
endowed
with
a
different
shape
form
and
different
senses
for
no
one
can
rightly
come
into
a
different
state
without
change
and
one
who
is
changed
is
no
longer
the
same
but
if
he
is
not
the
same
he
no
longer
exists
and
is
changed
from
what
he
was
becoming
something
else
only
led
us
astray
because
we
do
not
know
real
being
and
mistook
for
it
that
which
is
only
an
appearance
plutarch
often
describes
himself
as
an
initiate
what
he
portrays
here
is
a
condition
of
the
life
of
the
mystic
man
acquires
a
kind
of
wisdom
by
means
of
which
his
spirit
sees
through
the
illusive
character
of
what
the
senses
regard
as
being
or
reality
is
plunged
into
the
stream
of
becoming
and
man
is
subject
to
the
same
conditions
in
this
respect
as
all
other
things
in
the
world
before
the
eyes
of
his
spirit
he
himself
dissolves
the
of
his
being
is
broken
up
into
parts
into
fleeting
phenomena
birth
and
death
lose
their
distinctive
meaning
and
become
moments
of
appearing
and
disappearing
just
as
much
as
any
other
happenings
in
the
world
the
highest
can
not
be
found
in
the
connection
between
development
and
decay
it
can
only
be
sought
in
what
is
really
abiding
in
what
looks
back
to
the
past
and
forward
to
the
future
to
find
that
which
looks
the
spirit
backwards
and
forwards
is
the
first
stage
of
knowledge
this
is
the
spirit
which
is
manifesting
in
and
through
the
physical
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
physical
growth
it
does
not
come
into
being
and
again
decay
as
do
one
who
lives
entirely
in
the
world
of
sense
carries
the
spirit
latent
within
him
one
who
has
pierced
through
the
illusion
of
the
world
of
sense
has
the
spirit
within
him
as
a
manifest
reality
the
man
who
attains
to
this
insight
has
developed
a
new
principle
within
him
something
has
happened
within
him
as
in
a
plant
when
it
adds
a
coloured
flower
to
its
green
leaves
it
is
true
the
forces
causing
the
flower
to
grow
were
already
latent
in
the
plant
before
the
blossom
appeared
but
they
only
became
effective
when
this
took
place
divine
spiritual
forces
are
latent
in
the
man
who
lives
merely
through
his
senses
but
they
only
become
a
manifest
reality
in
the
initiate
such
is
the
transformation
which
takes
place
in
the
mystic
by
his
development
he
has
added
a
new
element
to
the
world
the
world
of
sense
made
him
a
human
being
endowed
with
senses
and
then
left
him
to
himself
nature
had
thus
fulfilled
her
mission
what
she
is
able
to
do
with
the
powers
operative
in
man
is
exhausted
not
so
the
forces
themselves
they
lie
as
though
spellbound
in
the
merely
natural
man
and
await
their
release
they
can
not
release
themselves
they
fade
away
to
nothing
unless
man
seizes
upon
them
and
develops
them
unless
he
calls
into
actual
being
what
is
latent
within
him
nature
evolves
from
the
imperfect
to
the
perfect
she
leads
beings
through
a
long
series
of
stages
from
inanimate
matter
through
all
living
forms
up
to
physical
man
man
looks
around
and
finds
himself
a
changing
being
with
physical
reality
but
he
also
perceives
within
him
the
forces
from
which
the
physical
reality
arose
these
forces
are
not
what
change
for
they
have
given
birth
to
the
changing
world
they
are
within
man
as
a
sign
that
there
is
more
life
within
him
than
he
can
physically
perceive
what
they
may
make
man
is
not
yet
there
he
feels
something
flash
up
within
him
which
created
everything
including
himself
and
he
feels
that
this
will
inspire
him
to
higher
creative
activity
this
something
is
within
him
it
existed
before
his
manifestation
in
the
flesh
and
will
exist
afterwards
by
means
of
it
he
became
but
he
may
lay
hold
of
it
and
take
part
in
its
creative
activity
such
are
the
feelings
animating
the
mystic
after
initiation
he
feels
the
eternal
and
divine
his
activity
is
to
become
a
part
of
that
divine
creative
activity
he
may
say
to
himself
i
have
discovered
a
higher
ego
within
me
but
that
ego
extends
beyond
the
bounds
of
my
it
existed
before
my
birth
and
will
exist
after
my
death
this
ego
has
created
from
all
eternity
it
will
go
on
creating
in
all
eternity
my
physical
personality
is
a
creation
of
this
ego
but
it
has
incorporated
me
within
it
it
works
within
me
i
am
a
part
of
it
what
i
henceforth
create
will
be
higher
than
the
physical
my
personality
is
only
a
means
for
this
creative
power
for
this
divine
is
within
me
thus
did
the
mystic
experience
his
birth
into
the
divine
the
mystic
called
the
power
that
flashed
up
within
him
a
daimon
he
was
himself
the
product
of
this
daimon
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
another
being
had
entered
him
and
taken
possession
of
his
organs
a
being
standing
between
his
physical
personality
and
the
cosmic
power
the
divinity
the
mystic
sought
this
his
daimon
he
said
to
himself
i
have
become
a
human
being
in
mighty
nature
but
nature
did
not
complete
her
task
this
completion
i
must
take
in
hand
myself
but
i
can
not
accomplish
it
in
the
gross
kingdom
of
nature
to
which
my
physical
personality
belongs
what
it
is
possible
to
develop
in
that
realm
has
already
been
developed
therefore
i
must
leave
this
kingdom
and
take
up
the
building
in
the
realm
of
the
spirit
at
the
point
where
nature
left
off
i
must
create
an
atmosphere
of
life
not
to
be
found
in
outer
nature
this
atmosphere
of
life
was
prepared
for
the
mystic
in
the
mystery
temples
there
the
forces
slumbering
within
him
were
awakened
there
he
was
changed
into
a
higher
creative
this
transformation
was
a
delicate
process
it
could
not
bear
the
untempered
atmosphere
of
everyday
life
but
when
once
it
was
completed
its
result
was
that
the
initiate
stood
as
a
rock
rising
from
the
eternal
and
able
to
defy
all
storms
but
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
reveal
his
experiences
to
any
one
unprepared
to
receive
them
plutarch
says
that
the
mysteries
gave
deep
understanding
of
the
true
nature
of
the
daimons
and
cicero
tells
us
that
from
the
mysteries
when
they
are
explained
and
traced
back
to
their
meaning
we
learn
the
nature
of
things
rather
than
that
of
the
gods
from
such
statements
we
see
clearly
that
there
were
higher
revelations
for
the
mystics
about
the
nature
of
things
than
that
which
popular
religion
was
able
to
impart
indeed
we
see
that
the
daimons
spiritual
beings
and
the
gods
themselves
needed
explaining
therefore
initiates
went
back
to
beings
of
a
higher
nature
than
daimons
or
gods
and
this
was
characteristic
of
the
essence
of
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
the
people
represented
the
gods
and
daimons
in
images
borrowed
from
the
world
of
would
not
one
who
had
penetrated
into
the
nature
of
the
eternal
doubt
about
the
eternal
nature
of
such
gods
as
these
how
could
the
zeus
of
popular
imagination
be
eternal
if
he
bore
within
him
the
qualities
of
a
perishable
being
one
thing
was
clear
to
the
mystics
that
man
arrives
at
a
conception
of
the
gods
in
a
different
way
from
the
conception
of
other
things
an
object
belonging
to
the
outer
world
compels
us
to
form
a
very
definite
idea
of
it
in
contrast
to
this
we
form
our
conception
of
the
gods
in
a
freer
and
somewhat
arbitrary
manner
the
control
of
the
outer
world
is
absent
reflection
teaches
us
that
what
we
conceive
as
gods
is
not
subject
to
outer
control
this
places
us
in
logical
uncertainty
we
begin
to
feel
that
we
ourselves
are
the
creators
of
our
gods
indeed
we
ask
ourselves
how
we
have
arrived
at
a
conception
of
the
universe
that
goes
beyond
physical
reality
the
initiate
was
obliged
to
ask
himself
such
questions
his
doubts
were
justified
look
at
all
representations
of
the
gods
he
might
think
to
himself
are
they
not
like
the
beings
we
meet
in
the
world
of
sense
did
not
man
create
them
for
himself
by
giving
or
withholding
from
them
in
his
thought
some
quality
belonging
to
beings
of
the
the
savage
lover
of
the
chase
creates
a
heaven
in
which
the
gods
themselves
take
part
in
glorious
hunting
and
the
greek
peopled
his
olympus
with
divine
beings
whose
models
were
taken
from
his
own
surroundings
the
philosopher
xenophanes
drew
attention
to
this
fact
with
a
crude
logic
we
know
that
the
older
greek
philosophers
were
entirely
dependent
on
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
we
will
afterwards
prove
this
in
detail
beginning
with
heraclitus
what
xenophanes
says
may
at
once
be
taken
as
the
conviction
of
a
mystic
it
runs
thus
men
who
picture
the
gods
as
created
in
their
own
human
forms
give
them
human
senses
voices
and
bodies
but
if
cattle
and
lions
had
hands
and
knew
how
to
use
them
like
men
in
painting
and
working
they
would
paint
the
forms
of
the
gods
and
shape
their
bodies
as
their
own
bodies
were
constituted
horses
would
create
gods
in
and
cattle
would
make
gods
like
bulls
through
insight
of
this
kind
man
may
begin
to
doubt
the
existence
of
anything
divine
he
may
reject
all
mythology
and
only
recognise
as
reality
what
is
forced
upon
him
by
his
but
the
mystic
did
not
become
a
doubter
of
this
kind
he
saw
that
the
doubter
would
be
like
a
plant
were
it
to
say
my
crimson
flowers
are
null
and
futile
because
i
am
complete
within
my
green
leaves
what
i
may
add
to
them
is
only
adding
illusive
appearance
just
as
little
could
the
mystic
rest
content
with
gods
thus
created
the
gods
of
the
people
if
the
plant
could
think
it
would
understand
that
the
forces
which
created
its
green
leaves
are
also
destined
to
create
crimson
flowers
and
it
would
not
rest
till
it
had
investigated
those
forces
and
come
face
to
face
with
them
this
was
the
attitude
of
the
mystic
towards
the
gods
of
the
people
he
did
not
deny
them
or
say
they
were
illusion
but
he
knew
they
had
been
created
by
man
the
same
forces
the
same
divine
element
which
are
at
work
in
nature
are
at
work
in
the
mystic
they
create
within
him
images
of
the
gods
he
wishes
to
see
the
force
that
creates
the
gods
it
comes
from
a
higher
source
than
these
gods
xenophanes
alludes
to
it
thus
there
is
one
god
greater
than
all
gods
and
men
his
form
is
not
like
that
of
mortals
his
thoughts
are
not
their
thoughts
this
god
was
also
the
god
of
the
mysteries
he
might
have
been
called
a
hidden
god
for
man
could
never
find
him
with
his
senses
only
look
at
outer
things
around
you
you
will
find
nothing
divine
exert
your
reason
you
may
be
able
to
detect
the
laws
by
which
things
appear
and
disappear
but
even
your
reason
will
not
show
you
anything
divine
saturate
your
imagination
with
religious
feeling
and
you
may
be
able
to
create
images
which
you
may
take
to
be
gods
but
your
reason
will
pull
them
to
pieces
for
it
will
prove
to
you
that
you
created
them
yourself
and
borrowed
the
material
from
the
so
long
as
you
look
at
outer
things
in
your
quality
of
simply
a
reasonable
being
you
must
deny
the
existence
of
god
for
god
is
hidden
from
the
senses
and
from
that
reason
of
yours
which
explains
god
lies
hidden
spellbound
in
the
world
and
you
need
his
own
power
to
find
him
you
must
awaken
that
power
in
yourself
these
are
the
teachings
which
were
given
to
the
candidate
for
initiation
and
now
there
began
for
him
the
great
cosmic
drama
with
which
his
life
was
bound
up
the
action
of
the
drama
meant
nothing
less
than
the
deliverance
of
the
spellbound
god
where
is
god
this
was
the
question
asked
by
the
soul
of
the
mystic
god
is
not
existent
but
nature
exists
and
in
nature
he
must
be
found
there
he
has
found
an
enchanted
grave
it
was
in
a
higher
sense
that
the
mystic
understood
the
words
god
is
love
for
god
has
exalted
that
love
to
its
climax
he
has
sacrificed
himself
in
infinite
love
he
has
poured
himself
out
fallen
into
number
in
the
manifold
of
nature
things
in
nature
live
and
he
does
not
live
he
slumbers
within
them
we
are
able
to
awaken
him
if
we
are
to
give
him
existence
we
must
deliver
him
by
the
creative
power
within
us
the
candidate
now
looks
unto
himself
as
latent
creative
power
as
yet
without
existence
the
divine
is
living
in
his
soul
in
the
soul
is
a
sacred
place
where
the
spellbound
god
may
wake
to
liberty
the
soul
is
the
mother
who
is
able
to
conceive
the
god
by
nature
if
the
soul
allows
herself
to
be
impregnated
by
nature
she
will
give
birth
to
the
divine
god
is
born
from
the
marriage
of
the
soul
with
nature
no
longer
a
hidden
but
a
manifest
god
he
has
life
a
perceptible
life
wandering
amongst
men
he
is
the
god
freed
from
enchantment
the
offspring
of
the
god
who
was
hidden
by
a
spell
he
is
not
the
great
god
who
was
and
is
and
is
to
come
but
yet
he
may
be
taken

the

of

the

remains
at
rest
in
the
unseen
the
son
is
born
to
man
out
of
his
own

mystical
knowledge
is
thus
an
actual
event
in

process
it
is
the
birth
of
the
divine
it
is
an
event
as
real
as
any
natural
event
only
enacted
upon
a
higher
plane
the
great
secret
of
the
mystic
is
that
he
himself
creates
his
god
but
that
he
first
prepares
himself
to
recognise
the
god
created
by
him
the
uninitiated
man
has
no
feeling
for
the
father
of
that
god
for
that
father
slumbers
under
a
spell
the
son
appears
to
be
born
of
a
virgin
the
soul
having
seemingly
given
birth
to
him
without

all
her
other
children
are
conceived
by

be

facts
combine

that
the

of

rested
on

we

plato
speak

in

and
it
almost
seems
says
he
as
though
those
who
have
appointed
the
initiations
for
us
are
not
at
all
ordinary
people
but
that
for
a
long
time
they
have
been
enjoining
upon
us
that
any
one
who
reaches
hades
without
being
initiated
and
sanctified
falls
into
the
mire
but
that
he
who
is
purified
and
consecrated
when
he
arrives
dwells
with
the
gods
for
those
who
have
to
do
with
initiations
say
that
there
are
many
but
few
really
inspired
these
latter
are
in
my
opinion
none
other
than
those
who
have
devoted
themselves
in
the
right
way
to
wisdom
i
myself
have
not
missed
the
opportunity
of
becoming
one
of
these
as
far
as
i
was
able
but
have
striven
after
it
in
every
way
it
is
only
a
man
who
is
putting
his
own
search
for
wisdom
entirely
at
the
disposal
of
the
condition
of
soul
created
by
initiation
who
could
thus
speak
of
the
mysteries
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
flood
of
light
is
poured
on
the
words
of
the
great
greek
philosophers
when
we
illustrate
them
from
the
mysteries
the
relation
of
heraclitus
of
ephesus
to
the
mysteries
is
plainly
given
us
in
a
saying
about
him
to
the
effect
that
his
thoughts
were
an
impassable
road
and
that
any
one
entering
upon
them
without
being
initiated
found
only
dimness
and
darkness
but
that
on
the
other
hand
they
were
brighter
than
the
sun
for
any
one
introduced
to
them
by
a
mystic
and
when
it
is
said
of
his
book
that
he
deposited
it
in
the
temple
of
artemis
this
only
means
that
initiates
alone
could
understand
him
edmund
pfleiderer
has
already
collected
the
historical
evidence
for
the
relation
of
heraclitus
to
the
mysteries
his
book
philosophie
des
heraklit
von
ephesus
im
lichte
der
berlin
heraclitus
was
called
the
obscure
because
it
was
only
through
the
mysteries
that
light
could
be
thrown
on
his
intuitive
views
heraclitus
comes
before
us
as
a
man
who
took
life
with
the
greatest
earnestness
we
see
plainly
from
his
features
if
we
know
how
to
reconstruct
them
that
he
bore
within
him
intimate
knowledge
which
he
knew
that
words
could
only
indicate
not
express
out
of
such
a
temper
of
mind
arose
his
celebrated
utterance
all
things
fleet
away
which
plutarch
explains
thus
we
do
not
dip
twice
into
the
same
wave
nor
can
we
touch
twice
the
same
mortal
being
for
through
abruptness
and
speed
it
disperses
and
brings
together
not
in
succession
but
simultaneously
a
man
who
thus
thinks
has
penetrated
the
nature
of
transitory
things
for
he
has
felt
compelled
to
characterise
the
essence
of
transitoriness
itself
in
the
clearest
terms
such
a
description
as
this
could
not
be
given
unless
the
transitory
were
being
measured
by
the
eternal
and
in
particular
it
could
not
be
extended
to
man
without
having
seen
his
inner
nature
heraclitus
has
extended
his
characterisation
to
man
life
and
death
waking
and
sleeping
youth
and
age
are
the
same
this
in
changing
is
that
and
that
again
this
in
this
sentence
there
is
expressed
full
knowledge
of
the
illusionary
nature
of
the
lower
personality
he
says
still
more
forcibly
life
and
death
are
found
in
our
living
even
as
in
our
dying
what
does
this
mean
but
that
it
is
only
a
transient
point
of
view
when
we
value
life
more
than
death
dying
is
to
perish
in
order
to
make
way
for
new
life
but
the
eternal
is
living
in
the
new
life
as
in
the
old
the
same
eternal
appears
in
transitory
life
as
in
death
when
we
grasp
this
eternal
we
look
upon
life
and
death
with
the
same
feeling
life
only
has
a
special
value
when
we
have
not
been
able
to
awaken
the
eternal
within
us
the
saying
all
things
fleet
away
might
be
repeated
a
thousand
times
but
unless
said
in
this
feeling
it
is
an
empty
sound
the
knowledge
of
eternal
growth
is
valueless
if
it
does
not
detach
us
from
temporal
growth
it
is
the
turning
away
from
that
love
of
life
which
impels
towards
the
transitory
which
heraclitus
indicates
in
his
utterance
how
can
we
say
about
our
daily
life
are
when
from
the
standpoint
of
the
eternal
we
know
that
are
and
are
not
cf
of
no
hades
and
dionysos
are
one
and
the
same
says
one
of
the
dionysos
the
god
of
joy
in
life
of
germination
and
growth
to
whom
the
dionysiac
festivals
are
dedicated
is
for
heraclitus
the
same
as
hades
the
god
of
destruction
and
annihilation
only
one
who
sees
death
in
life
and
life
in
death
and
in
both
the
eternal
high
above
life
and
death
can
view
the
merits
and
demerits
of
existence
in
the
right
light
then
even
imperfections
become
justified
for
in
them
too
lives
the
eternal
what
they
are
from
the
standpoint
of
the
limited
lower
life
they
are
only
in
appearance
the
gratification
of
wishes
is
not
necessarily
a
happiness
for
them
illness
makes
health
sweet
and
good
hunger
makes
food
appreciated
and
toil
rest
the
sea
contains
the
purest
and
impurest
water
drinkable
and
wholesome
for
fishes
it
is
undrinkable
and
injurious
to
human
beings
here
heraclitus
is
not
primarily
drawing
attention
to
the
transitoriness
of
earthly
things
but
to
the
splendour
and
majesty
of
the
eternal
heraclitus
speaks
vehemently
against
homer
and
hesiod
and
the
learned
men
of
his
day
he
wished
to
show
up
their
way
of
thinking
which
clings
to
the
transitory
only
he
did
not
desire
gods
endowed
with
qualities
taken
from
a
perishable
world
and
he
could
not
regard
as
a
supreme
science
that
science
which
investigates
the
growth
and
decay
of
things
for
him
the
eternal
speaks
out
of
the
perishable
and
for
this
eternal
he
has
a
profound
symbol
the
harmony
of
the
world
returns
upon
itself
like
that
of
the
lyre
and
the
bow
what
depths
are
hidden
in
this
image
by
the
pressing
asunder
of
forces
and
again
by
the
harmonising
of
these
divergent
forces
unity
is
attained
how
one
sound
contradicts
another
and
yet
together
they
produce
harmony
if
we
apply
this
to
the
spiritual
world
we
have
the
thought
of
heraclitus
immortals
are
mortal
mortals
immortal
living
the
death
of
mortals
dying
the
life
of
the
immortals
it
is
man
original
fault
to
direct
his
cognition
to
the
transitory
thereby
he
turns
away
from
the
eternal
and
life
becomes
a
danger
to
him
what
happens
to
him
comes
to
him
through
life
but
its
events
lose
their
sting
if
he
ceases
to
set
unconditioned
value
on
life
in
that
case
his
innocence
is
restored
to
him
it
is
as
though
he
were
from
the
seriousness
of
life
able
to
return
to
his
childhood
the
adult
takes
many
things
seriously
with
which
a
child
merely
plays
but
one
who
really
knows
becomes
like
a
child
serious
values
lose
their
value
looked
at
from
the
standpoint
of
eternity
life
then
seems
like
a
play
on
this
account
does
heraclitus
say
eternity
is
a
child
at
play
it
is
the
reign
of
a
child
where
does
the
original
fault
lie
in
taking
with
the
utmost
seriousness
what
does
not
deserve
to
be
so
taken
god
has
poured
himself
into
the
universe
of
things
if
we
take
these
things
and
leave
god
unheeded
we
take
them
in
earnest
as
the
tombs
of
god
we
should
play
with
them
like
a
child
and
should
earnestly
strive
to
awaken
forth
from
them
god
who
sleeps
spellbound
within
them
contemplation
of
the
eternal
acts
like
a
consuming
fire
on
ordinary
illusions
about
the
nature
of
things
the
spirit
breaks
up
thoughts
which
come
through
the
senses
it
fuses
them
this
is
the
higher
meaning
of
the
heraclitean
thought
that
fire
is
the
primary
element
of
all
things
this
thought
is
certainly
to
be
taken
at
first
as
an
ordinary
physical
explanation
of
the
phenomena
of
the
universe
but
no
one
understands
heraclitus
who
does
not
think
of
him
in
the
same
way
as
philo
living
in
the
early
days
of
christianity
thought
of
the
laws
of
the
bible
there
are
people
he
says
who
take
the
written
laws
as
symbols
of
spiritual
teaching
who
diligently
search
for
the
latter
but
despise
the
laws
themselves
i
can
only
blame
such
for
they
should
pay
heed
to
both
to
knowledge
of
the
hidden
meaning
and
to
observing
the
obvious
one
if
the
question
is
discussed
whether
heraclitus
meant
by
fire
physical
fire
or
whether
fire
for
him
was
only
a
symbol
of
eternal
spirit
which
dissolves
and
reconstitutes
all
things
this
is
putting
a
wrong
construction
upon
his
thought
he
meant
both
and
neither
of
these
things
for
spirit
was
also
alive
for
him
in
ordinary
fire
and
the
force
which
is
physically
active
in
fire
lives
on
a
higher
plane
in
the
human
soul
which
melts
in
its
crucible
mere
so
that
out
of
this
the
contemplation
of
the
eternal
may
arise
it
is
very
easy
to
misunderstand
heraclitus
he
makes
strife
the
father
of
things
but
only
of
things
not
of
the
eternal
if
there
were
no
contradictions
in
the
world
if
the
most
multifarious
interests
were
not
opposing
each
other
the
world
of
becoming
of
transitory
things
would
not
exist
but
what
is
revealed
in
this
antagonism
what
is
poured
forth
into
it
is
not
strife
but
harmony
just
because
there
is
strife
in
all
things
the
spirit
of
the
wise
should
pass
over
them
like
a
breath
of
fire
and
change
them
into
harmony
at
this
point
there
shines
forth
one
of
the
great
thoughts
of
heraclitean
wisdom
what
is
man
as
a
personal
being
from
the
above
point
of
view
heraclitus
is
able
to
answer
man
is
composed
of
the
conflicting
elements
into
which
divinity
has
poured
itself
in
this
state
he
finds
himself
and
beyond
this
becomes
aware
of
the
spirit
within
him
the
spirit
which
is
rooted
in
the
eternal
but
the
spirit
itself
is
born
for
man
out
of
the
conflict
of
elements
and
it
is
the
first
which
has
to
calm
them
in
man
nature
surpasses
her
natural
limits
it
is
indeed
the
same
universal
force
which
created
antagonism
and
the
mixture
of
elements
which
is
afterwards
by
its
wisdom
to
do
away
with
the
conflict
here
we
arrive
at
the
eternal
dualism
which
lives
in
man
the
perpetual
antagonism
between
the
temporal
and
the
eternal
through
the
eternal
he
has
become
something
quite
definite
and
out
of
this
he
is
to
create
something
higher
he
is
both
dependent
and
independent
he
can
only
participate
in
the
eternal
spirit
whom
he
contemplates
in
the
measure
of
the
compound
of
elements
which
that
eternal
spirit
has
effected
within
him
and
it
is
just
on
this
account
that
he
is
called
upon
to
fashion
the
eternal
out
of
the
temporal
the
spirit
works
within
him
but
works
in
a
special
way
it
works
out
of
the
temporal
it
is
the
peculiarity
of
the
human
soul
that
a
temporal
thing
should
be
able
to
work
like
an
eternal
one
should
grow
and
increase
in
power
like
an
eternal
thing
this
is
why
the
soul
is
at
once
like
a
god
and
a
worm
man
owing
to
this
stands
in
a
between
god
and
animals
the
growing
and
increasing
force
within
him
is
his
daimonic
element
that
within
him
which
pushes
out
beyond
himself
man
daimon
is
his
destiny
thus
strikingly
does
heraclitus
make
reference
to
this
fact
he
extends
man
vital
essence
far
beyond
the
personal
the
personality
is
the
vehicle
of
the
daimon
which
is
not
confined
within
the
limit
of
the
personality
and
for
which
the
birth
and
death
of
the
personality
are
of
no
importance
what
is
the
relation
of
the
daimonic
element
to
the
personality
which
comes
and
goes
the
personality
is
only
a
form
for
the
manifestation
of
the
daimon
one
who
has
arrived
at
this
knowledge
looks
beyond
himself
backwards
and
forwards
the
daimonic
experiences
through
which
he
has
passed
are
enough
to
prove
to
him
his
own
immortality
and
he
can
no
longer
limit
his
daimon
to
the
one
function
of
occupying
his
personality
for
the
latter
can
only
be
one
of
the
forms
in
which
the
daimon
is
manifested
the
daimon
can
not
be
shut
up
within
one
personality
he
has
power
to
animate
many
he
is
able
to
transform
himself
from
one
personality
into
another
the
great
thought
of
reincarnation
springs
as
a
matter
of
course
from
the
heraclitean
premises
and
not
only
the
thought
but
the
experience
of
the
fact
the
thought
only
paves
the
way
for
the
experience
one
who
becomes
conscious
of
the
daimonic
element
within
him
does
not
recognise
it
as
innocent
and
in
its
first
stage
he
finds
that
it
has
qualities
whence
do
they
come
why
have
i
certain
natural
aptitudes
because
others
have
already
worked
upon
my
daimon
and
what
becomes
of
the
work
which
i
accomplish
in
the
daimon
if
i
am
not
to
assume
that
its
task
ends
with
my
personality
i
am
working
for
a
future
personality
between
me
and
the
spirit
of
the
universe
something
interposes
which
reaches
beyond
me
but
is
not
yet
the
same
as
divinity
this
something
is
my
daimon
my
is
only
the
product
of
yesterday
my
will
be
the
product
of
in
the
same
way
my
life
is
the
result
of
a
former
and
will
be
the
foundation
of
a
future
one
just
as
mortal
man
looks
back
to
innumerable
yesterdays
and
forward
to
many
so
does
the
soul
of
the
sage
look
upon
many
lives
in
his
past
and
many
in
the
future
the
thoughts
and
aptitudes
i
acquired
yesterday
i
am
using
is
it
not
the
same
with
life
do
not
people
enter
upon
the
horizon
of
existence
with
the
most
diverse
capacities
whence
this
difference
does
it
proceed
from
nothing
our
natural
sciences
take
much
credit
to
themselves
for
having
banished
miracle
from
our
views
of
organic
life
david
frederick
strauss
in
his
und
neuer
considers
it
a
great
achievement
of
our
day
that
we
no
longer
think
that
a
perfect
organic
being
is
a
miracle
issuing
from
nothing
we
understand
its
perfection
when
we
are
able
to
explain
it
as
a
development
from
imperfection
the
structure
of
an
ape
is
no
longer
a
miracle
if
we
assume
its
ancestors
to
have
been
primitive
fishes
which
have
been
gradually
transformed
let
us
at
least
submit
to
accept
as
reasonable
in
the
domain
of
spirit
what
seems
to
us
to
be
right
in
the
domain
of
nature
is
the
perfect
spirit
to
have
the
same
antecedents
as
the
imperfect
one
does
a
goethe
have
the
same
antecedents
as
any

the
antecedents
of
an
ape
are
as
unlike
those
of
a
fish
as
are
the
antecedents
of
goethe
mind
unlike
those
of
a

the
spiritual
ancestry
of
goethe
soul
is
a
different
one
from
that
of
the
savage
soul
the
soul
has
grown
as
well
as
the
body
the
daimon
in
goethe
has
more
progenitors
than
the
one
in
a
savage
let
us
take
the
doctrine
of
reincarnation
in
this
sense
and
we
shall
no
longer
find
it
unscientific
we
shall
be
able
to
explain
in
the
right
way
what
we
find
in
our
souls
and
we
shall
not
take
what
we
find
as
if
created
by
a
miracle
if
i
can
write
it
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
i
learned
to
write
no
one
who
has
a
pen
in
his
hand
for
the
first
time
can
sit
down
and
write
offhand
but
one
who
has
come
into
the
world
with
the
stamp
of
genius
must
he
owe
it
to
a
miracle
no
even
the
stamp
of
genius
must
be
acquired
it
must
have
been
learned
and
when
it
appears
in
a
person
we
call
it
a
daimon
this
daimon
too
must
have
been
to
school
it
acquired
in
a
former
life
what
it
puts
into
force
in
a
later
one
in
this
form
and
this
form
only
did
the
thought
of
eternity
pass
before
the
mind
of
heraclitus
and
other
greek
sages
there
was
no
question
with
them
of
a
continuance
of
the
immediate
personality
after
death
compare
some
verses
of
empedocles
he
says
of
those
who
accept
the
data
of
experience
as
miracles
foolish
and
ignorant
they
and
do
not
reach
far
with
their
thinking
who
suppose
that
what
has
not
existed
can
come
into
being
or
that
something
may
die
away
wholly
and
vanish
completely
impossible
is
it
that
any
beginning
can
come
from
quite
impossible
also
that
being
can
fade
into
nothing
for
wherever
a
being
is
driven
there
will
it
continue
to
be
never
will
any
believe
who
has
been
in
these
matters
instructed
that
spirits
of
men
only
live
while
what
is
called
life
here
endures
that
only
so
long
do
they
live
receiving
their
joys
and
their
sorrows
but
that
ere
they
were
born
here
and
when
they
are
dead
they
are
nothing
the
greek
sage
did
not
even
raise
the
question
whether
there
was
an
eternal
part
in
man
but
only
enquired
in
what
this
eternal
element
consisted
and
how
man
can
nourish
and
cherish
it
in
himself
for
from
the
outset
it
was
clear
to
him
that
man
is
an
intermediate
creation
between
the
earthly
and
the
divine
it
was
not
a
question
of
a
divine
being
outside
and
beyond
the
world
the
divine
lives
in
man
but
lives
in
him
only
in
a
human
way
it
is
the
force
urging
man
to
make
himself
ever
more
and
more
divine
only
one
who
thinks
thus
can
say
with
empedocles
when
leaving
thy
body
behind
thee
thou
soarest
into
the
ether
then
thou
becomest
a
god
immortal
not
subject
to
death
what
may
be
done
for
a
human
life
from
this
point
of
view
it
may
be
introduced
into
the
magic
circle
of
the
eternal
for
in
man
there
must
be
forces
which
merely
natural
life
does
not
develop
and
the
life
might
pass
away
unused
if
the
forces
remained
idle
to
open
them
up
thereby
to
make
man
like
the
divine
this
was
the
task
of
the
mysteries
and
this
was
also
the
mission
which
the
greek
sages
set
before
themselves
in
this
way
we
can
understand
plato
utterance
that
he
who
passes
unsanctified
and
uninitiated
into
the
world
below
will
lie
in
a
slough
but
that
he
who
arrives
there
after
initiation
and
purification
will
dwell
with
the
gods
we
have
to
do
here
with
a
conception
of
immortality
the
significance
of
which
lies
bound
up
within
the
universe
everything
which
man
undertakes
in
order
to
awaken
the
eternal
within
him
he
does
in
order
to
raise
the
value
of
the
world
existence
the
fresh
knowledge
he
gains
does
not
make
him
an
idle
spectator
of
the
universe
forming
images
for
himself
of
what
would
be
there
just
as
much
if
he
did
not
exist
the
force
of
his
knowledge
is
a
higher
one
it
is
one
of
the
creative
forces
of
nature
what
flashes
up
within
him
spiritually
is
something
divine
which
was
previously
under
a
spell
and
which
failing
the
knowledge
he
has
gained
must
have
lain
fallow
and
waited
for
some
other
exorcist
thus
a
human
personality
does
not
live
in
and
for
itself
but
for
the
world
life
extends
far
beyond
individual
existence
when
looked
at
in
this
way
from
within
such
a
point
of
view
we
can
understand
utterances
like
that
of
pindar
giving
a
vista
of
the
eternal
happy
is
he
who
has
seen
the
mysteries
and
then
descends
under
the
hollow
earth
he
knows
the
end
of
life
and
he
knows
the
beginning
promised
by
zeus
we
understand
the
proud
traits
and
solitary
nature
of
sages
such
as
heraclitus
they
were
able
to
say
proudly
of
themselves
that
much
had
been
revealed
to
them
for
they
did
not
attribute
their
knowledge
to
their
transitory
personality
but
to
the
eternal
daimon
within
them
their
pride
had
as
a
necessary
adjunct
the
stamp
of
humility
and
modesty
expressed
in
the
words
all
knowledge
of
perishable
things
is
in
perpetual
flux
like
the
things
themselves
heraclitus
calls
the
eternal
universe
a
play
he
could
also
call
it
the
most
serious
of
realities
but
the
word
earnest
has
lost
its
force
through
being
applied
to
earthly
experiences
on
the
other
hand
the
realisation
of
the
play
of
the
eternal
leaves
man
that
security
in
life
of
which
he
is
deprived
by
that
earnest
which
has
come
out
of
transitory
things
a
different
conception
of
the
universe
from
that
of
heraclitus
grew
up
on
the
basis
of
the
mysteries
in
the
community
founded
by
pythagoras
in
the
century
in
southern
italy
the
pythagoreans
saw
the
basis
of
things
in
the
numbers
and
geometrical
figures
of
which
they
investigated
the
laws
by
means
of
mathematics
aristotle
says
of
them
they
first
studied
mathematics
and
quite
engrossed
in
them
they
considered
the
elements
of
mathematics
to
be
the
elements
of
all
things
now
as
numbers
are
naturally
the
first
thing
in
mathematics
and
they
thought
they
saw
many
resemblances
in
numbers
to
things
and
to
development
and
certainly
more
in
numbers
than
in
fire
earth
and
water
in
this
way
one
quality
of
numbers
came
to
mean
for
them
justice
another
the
soul
and
spirit
another
time
and
so
on
with
all
the
rest
moreover
they
found
in
numbers
the
qualities
and
connections
of
harmony
and
thus
everything
else
in
accordance
with
its
whole
nature
seemed
to
be
an
image
of
numbers
and
numbers
seemed
to
be
the
first
thing
in
nature
the
mathematical
and
scientific
study
of
natural
phenomena
must
always
lead
to
a
certain
pythagorean
habit
of
thought
when
a
string
of
a
certain
length
is
struck
a
particular
sound
is
produced
if
the
string
is
shortened
in
certain
numeric
proportions
other
sounds
will
be
produced
the
pitch
of
the
sounds
may
be
expressed
in
figures
physics
also
expresses
in
figures
when
two
bodies
combine
into
one
substance
it
always
happens
that
a
certain
definite
quantity
of
the
one
body
expressible
in
numbers
combines
with
a
certain
definite
quantity
of
the
other
the
pythagoreans
sense
of
observation
was
directed
to
such
arrangements
of
measures
and
numbers
in
nature
geometrical
figures
also
play
a
similar
rôle
astronomy
for
instance
is
mathematics
applied
to
the
heavenly
bodies
one
fact
became
important
to
the
of
the
pythagoreans
this
was
that
man
quite
alone
and
purely
through
his
mental
activity
discovers
the
laws
of
numbers
and
figures
and
yet
that
when
he
looks
abroad
into
nature
he
finds
that
things
are
obeying
the
same
laws
which
he
has
ascertained
for
himself
in
his
own
mind
man
forms
the
idea
of
an
ellipse
and
ascertains
the
laws
of
ellipses
and
the
heavenly
bodies
move
according
to
the
laws
which
he
has
established
it
is
not
of
course
a
question
here
of
the
astronomical
views
of
the
pythagoreans
what
may
be
said
about
these
may
equally
be
said
of
copernican
views
in
the
connection
now
being
dealt
with
hence
it
follows
as
a
direct
consequence
that
the
achievements
of
the
human
soul
are
not
an
activity
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
but
that
in
those
achievements
the
cosmic
laws
are
expressed
the
pythagoreans
said
the
senses
show
man
physical
phenomena
but
they
do
not
show
the
harmonious
order
which
these
things
follow
the
human
mind
must
first
find
that
harmonious
order
within
itself
if
it
wishes
to
behold
it
in
the
outer
world
the
deeper
meaning
of
the
world
that
which
bears
sway
within
it
as
an
eternal
necessity
this
makes
its
appearance
in
the
human
soul
and
becomes
a
present
reality
there
the
meaning
of
the
universe
is
revealed
in
the
soul
this
meaning
is
not
to
be
found
in
what
we
see
hear
and
touch
but
in
what
the
soul
brings
up
to
the
light
from
its
own
unseen
depths
the
eternal
laws
are
thus
hidden
in
the
depths
of
the
soul
if
we
descend
there
we
shall
find
the
eternal
god
the
eternal
harmony
of
the
world
is
in
the
human
soul
the
is
not
limited
to
the
bodily
substance
which
is
enclosed
within
the
skin
for
what
is
born
in
the
soul
is
nothing
less
than
the
laws
by
which
worlds
revolve
in
celestial
space
the
soul
is
not
in
the
personality
the
personality
only
serves
as
the
organ
through
which
the
order
which
pervades
cosmic
space
may
express
itself
there
is
something
of
the
spirit
of
pythagoras
in
what
one
of
the
fathers
gregory
of
nyssa
said
it
is
said
that
human
nature
is
something
small
and
limited
and
that
god
is
infinite
and
it
is
asked
how
the
finite
can
embrace
the
infinite
but
who
dares
to
say
that
the
infinity
of
the
godhead
is
limited
by
the
boundary
of
the
flesh
as
though
by
a
vessel
for
not
even
during
our
lifetime
is
the
spiritual
nature
confined
within
the
boundaries
of
the
flesh
the
mass
of
the
body
it
is
true
is
limited
by
neighbouring
parts
but
the
soul
reaches
out
freely
into
the
whole
of
creation
by
the
movements
of
thought
the
soul
is
not
the
personality
the
soul
belongs
to
infinity
from
such
a
point
of
view
the
pythagoreans
must
have
considered
that
only
fools
could
imagine
the
to
be
exhausted
with
the
personality
for
them
too
as
for
heraclitus
the
essential
point
was
the
awakening
of
the
eternal
in
the
personal
knowledge
for
them
meant
intercourse
with
the
eternal
the
more
man
brought
the
eternal
element
within
him
into
existence
the
greater
must
he
necessarily
seem
to
the
pythagoreans
life
in
their
community
consisted
in
holding
intercourse
with
the
eternal
the
object
of
the
pythagorean
education
was
to
lead
the
members
of
the
community
to
that
intercourse
the
education
was
therefore
a
philosophical
initiation
and
the
pythagoreans
might
well
say
that
by
their
manner
of
life
they
were
aiming
at
a
goal
similar
to
that
of
the
cults
of
the
mysteries
iv
plato
as
a
mystic
the
importance
of
the
mysteries
to
the
spiritual
life
of
the
greeks
may
be
realised
from
plato
conception
of
the
universe
there
is
only
one
way
of
understanding
him
thoroughly
it
is
to
place
him
in
the
light
which
streams
forth
from
the
mysteries
plato
later
disciples
the
credit
him
with
a
secret
doctrine
which
he
imparted
only
to
those
who
were
worthy
and
which
he
conveyed
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
his
teaching
was
looked
upon
as
mysterious
in
the
same
sense
as
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
even
if
the
seventh
platonic
letter
is
not
from
his
hand
as
is
alleged
it
does
not
signify
for
our
present
purpose
for
it
does
not
matter
whether
it
was
he
or
another
who
gave
utterance
to
the
view
expressed
in
this
letter
this
view
is
of
the
essence
of
plato
philosophy
in
the
letter
we
read
as
follows
this
much
i
may
say
about
all
those
who
have
written
or
may
hereafter
write
as
if
they
knew
the
aim
of
my
work
that
no
credence
is
to
be
attached
to
their
words
whether
they
obtained
their
information
from
me
or
from
others
or
invented
it
themselves
i
have
written
nothing
on
this
subject
nor
would
anything
be
allowed
to
appear
this
kind
of
thing
can
not
be
expressed
in
words
like
other
teaching
but
needs
a
long
study
of
the
subject
and
a
making
oneself
one
with
it
then
it
is
as
though
a
spark
leaped
up
and
kindled
a
light
in
the
soul
which
thereafter
is
able
to
keep
itself
alight
this
utterance
might
only
indicate
the
writer
powerlessness
to
express
his
meaning
in
words
a
mere
personal
weakness
if
the
idea
of
the
mysteries
were
not
to
be
found
in
them
the
subject
on
which
plato
had
not
written
and
would
never
write
must
be
something
about
which
all
writing
would
be
futile
it
must
be
a
feeling
a
sentiment
an
experience
which
is
not
gained
by
instantaneous
communication
but
by
making
oneself
one
with
it
in
heart
and
soul
the
reference
is
to
the
inner
education
which
plato
was
able
to
give
those
he
selected
for
them
fire
flashed
forth
from
his
words
for
others
only
thoughts
the
manner
of
our
approach
to
plato
is
not
a
matter
of
indifference
they
will
mean
more
or
less
to
us
according
to
our
spiritual
condition
much
more
passed
from
plato
to
his
disciples
than
the
literal
meaning
of
his
words
the
place
where
he
taught
his
listeners
thrilled
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
mysteries
his
words
awoke
overtones
in
higher
regions
which
vibrated
with
them
but
these
overtones
needed
the
atmosphere
of
the
mysteries
or
they
died
away
without
having
been
heard
in
the
centre
of
the
world
of
the
platonic
dialogues
stands
the
personality
of
socrates
we
need
not
here
touch
upon
the
historical
aspect
of
that
personality
it
is
a
question
of
the
character
of
socrates
as
it
appears
in
plato
socrates
is
a
person
consecrated
by
his
dying
for
truth
he
died
as
only
an
initiate
can
die
as
one
to
whom
death
is
merely
a
moment
of
life
like
other
moments
he
approaches
death
as
he
would
any
other
event
in
existence
his
attitude
towards
it
was
such
that
even
in
his
friends
the
feelings
usual
on
such
an
occasion
were
not
aroused
phædo
says
this
in
the
on
the
immortality
of
the
truly
i
found
myself
in
the
strangest
state
of
mind
i
had
no
compassion
for
him
as
is
usual
at
the
death
of
a
dear
friend
so
happy
did
the
man
appear
to
me
in
his
demeanour
and
speech
so
steadfast
and
noble
was
his
end
that
i
was
confident
that
he
was
not
going
to
hades
without
a
divine
mission
and
that
even
there
it
would
be
as
well
with
him
as
it
is
with
any
one
anywhere
no
emotion
overcame
me
as
might
have
been
expected
at
such
a
mournful
event
nor
on
the
other
hand
was
i
in
a
cheerful
mood
as
is
usual
during
philosophical
pursuits
and
although
our
conversation
was
of
this
nature
but
i
found
myself
in
a
wondrous
state
of
mind
and
in
an
unwonted
blending
of
joy
and
grief
when
i
reflected
that
this
man
was
about
to
die
the
dying
socrates
instructs
his
disciples
about
immortality
his
personality
which
had
learned
by
experience
the
worthlessness
of
life
furnishes
a
kind
of
proof
quite
different
from
logic
and
arguments
founded
on
reason
it
seems
as
if
it
were
not
a
man
speaking
for
this
man
was
passing
away
but
as
if
it
were
the
voice
of
eternal
truth
itself
which
had
taken
up
its
abode
in
a
perishable
personality
where
a
mortal
being
is
dissolving
into
nothing
there
seems
to
be
a
breath
of
the
air
in
which
it
is
possible
for
eternal
harmonies
to
resound
we
hear
no
logical
proofs
of
immortality
the
whole
discourse
is
designed
to
lead
the
friends
where
they
may
behold
the
eternal
then
they
will
need
no
proofs
would
it
be
necessary
to
prove
that
a
rose
is
red
to
one
who
has
one
before
him
why
should
it
be
necessary
to
prove
that
spirit
is
eternal
to
one
whose
eyes
we
have
opened
to
behold
spirit
experiences
inner
events
socrates
points
to
them
and
first
of
all
to
the
experience
of
wisdom
itself
what
does
he
desire
who
aspires
after
wisdom
he
wishes
to
free
himself
from
what
the
senses
offer
him
in
perception
he
seeks
for
the
spirit
in
the
is
not
this
a
fact
which
may
be
compared
with
dying
for
according
to
socrates
those
who
occupy
themselves
with
philosophy
in
the
right
way
are
really
striving
after
nothing
else
than
to
die
and
to
be
dead
without
this
being
perceived
by
others
if
this
is
true
it
would
be
strange
if
after
having
aimed
at
this
all
through
life
when
death
itself
comes
they
should
be
indignant
at
that
which
they
have
so
long
striven
after
and
taken
pains
about
to
corroborate
this
socrates
asks
one
of
his
friends
does
it
seem
to
you
befitting
a
philosopher
to
take
trouble
about
fleshly
pleasures
such
as
eating
and
drinking
or
about
sexual
pleasures
and
do
you
think
that
such
a
man
pays
much
heed
to
other
bodily
needs
to
have
fine
clothes
shoes
and
other
bodily
adornments
do
you
think
he
considers
or
scorns
this
more
than
utmost
necessity
demands
does
it
not
seem
to
you
that
it
should
be
such
a
man
whole
preoccupation
not
to
turn
his
thoughts
to
the
body
but
as
much
as
possible
away
from
it
and
towards
the
soul
therefore
this
is
the
first
mark
of
the
philosopher
that
he
more
than
all
other
men
relieves
his
soul
of
association
with
the
body
on
this
subject
socrates
has
something
more
to
say
that
aspiration
after
wisdom
has
this
much
in
common
with
dying
that
it
turns
man
away
from
the
physical
but
whither
does
he
turn
towards
the
spiritual
but
can
he
desire
the
same
from
spirit
as
from
the
senses
socrates
thus
expresses
himself
on
this
point
but
how
is
it
with
reasonable
knowledge
itself
is
the
body
a
hindrance
or
not
if
we
take
it
as
a
companion
in
our
search
for
knowledge
i
mean
do
sight
and
hearing
procure
man
any
truth
or
is
what
the
poets
sing
meaningless
that
we
see
and
hear
nothing
clearly
when
does
the
soul
catch
sight
of
truth
for
when
it
tries
to
examine
something
with
the
help
of
the
body
it
is
manifestly
deceived
by
the
latter
everything
of
which
we
are
cognisant
by
means
of
our
bodily
senses
appears
and
disappears
and
it
is
this
appearing
and
disappearing
which
is
the
cause
of
our
being
deceived
but
when
with
our
reasonable
intelligence
we
look
deeper
into
things
the
eternal
element
in
them
is
revealed
to
us
thus
the
senses
do
not
offer
us
the
eternal
in
its
true
form
the
moment
we
trust
them
implicitly
they
deceive
us
they
cease
to
deceive
us
if
we
confront
them
with
our
thinking
insight
and
submit
what
they
tell
us
to
its
examination
but
how
could
our
thinking
insight
sit
in
judgment
on
the
declarations
of
the
senses
unless
there
were
something
living
within
it
which
transcends
therefore
the
truth
or
falsity
in
things
is
decided
by
something
within
us
which
opposes
the
physical
body
and
is
consequently
not
subject
to
its
laws
first
of
all
it
can
not
be
subject
to
the
laws
of
growth
and
decay
for
this
something
contains
truth
within
it
now
truth
can
not
have
a
yesterday
and
a
it
can
not
be
one
thing
one
day
and
another
the
next
like
objects
of
sense
therefore
truth
must
be
something
eternal
and
when
the
philosopher
turns
away
from
the
perishable
things
of
sense
and
towards
truth
he
is
turning
towards
an
eternal
element
that
lives
within
him
if
we
immerse
ourselves
wholly
in
spirit
we
shall
live
wholly
in
truth
the
things
of
sense
around
us
are
no
longer
present
merely
in
their
physical
form
and
he
accomplishes
this
most
perfectly
says
socrates
who
approaches
everything
as
much
as
possible
with
the
spirit
only
without
either
looking
round
when
he
is
thinking
or
letting
any
other
sense
interrupt
his
reflecting
but
who
making
use
of
pure
thought
only
strives
to
grasp
everything
as
it
is
in
itself
separating
it
as
much
as
possible
from
eyes
and
ears
in
short
from
the
whole
body
which
only
disturbs
the
soul
and
does
not
allow
it
to
attain
truth
and
insight
when
associated
with
the
soul
now
is
not
death
the
release
and
separation
of
the
soul
from
the
body
and
it
is
only
true
philosophers
who
are
always
striving
to
release
the
soul
as
far
as
they
can
this
therefore
is
the
philosopher
vocation
to
deliver
and
separate
the
soul
from
the
body
therefore
it
would
be
foolish
if
a
man
who
all
his
life
has
taken
measures
to
be
as
near
death
as
possible
should
when
it
comes
rebel
against
it
in
truth
the
real
seekers
after
wisdom
aspire
to
die
and
of
all
men
they
are
those
who
least
fear
death
moreover
socrates
bases
all
higher
morality
on
liberation
from
the
body
he
who
only
follows
what
his
body
ordains
is
not
moral
who
is
valiant
asks
socrates
he
is
valiant
who
does
not
obey
his
body
but
the
demands
of
his
spirit
when
these
demands
imperil
the
body
and
who
is
temperate
is
not
this
he
who
does
not
let
himself
be
carried
away
by
desires
but
who
maintains
an
indifferent
and
moral
demeanour
with
regard
to
them
therefore
are
not
those
alone
temperate
who
set
least
value
on
the
body
and
live
in
the
love
of
wisdom
and
so
it
is
in
the
opinion
of
socrates
with
all
virtues
thence
socrates
goes
on
to
characterise
intellectual
cognition
what
is
it
after
all
to
cognise
undoubtedly
we
arrive
at
it
by
forming
judgments
i
form
a
judgment
about
some
object
for
instance
i
say
to
myself
what
is
in
front
of
me
is
a
tree
how
do
i
arrive
at
saying
that
i
can
only
do
it
if
i
already
know
what
a
tree
is
i
must
remember
my
conception
of
a
tree
a
tree
is
a
physical
object
if
i
remember
a
tree
i
therefore
remember
a
physical
object
i
say
of
something
that
it
is
a
tree
if
it
resembles
other
things
which
i
have
previously
observed
and
which
i
know
to
be
trees
memory
is
the
medium
for
this
knowledge
it
makes
it
possible
for
me
to
compare
the
various
objects
of
sense
but
this
does
not
exhaust
my
knowledge
if
i
see
two
similar
things
i
form
a
judgment
and
say
these
things
are
alike
now
in
reality
two
things
are
never
exactly
alike
i
can
only
find
a
likeness
in
certain
respects
the
idea
of
a
perfect
similarity
therefore
arises
within
me
without
having
its
correspondence
in
reality
and
this
idea
helps
me
to
form
a
judgment
as
memory
helps
me
to
a
judgment
and
to
knowledge
just
as
one
tree
reminds
me
of
others
so
am
i
reminded
of
the
idea
of
similarity
by
looking
at
two
things
from
a
certain
point
of
view
thoughts
and
memories
therefore
arise
within
me
which
are
not
due
to
physical
reality
all
kinds
of
knowledge
not
borrowed
from
are
grounded
on
such
thoughts
the
whole
of
mathematics
consists
of
them
he
would
be
a
bad
geometrician
who
could
only
bring
into
mathematical
relations
what
he
can
see
with
his
eyes
and
touch
with
his
hands
thus
we
have
thoughts
which
do
not
originate
in
perishable
nature
but
arise
out
of
the
spirit
and
it
is
these
that
bear
in
them
the
mark
of
eternal
truth
what
mathematics
teach
will
be
eternally
true
even
if
the
whole
cosmic
system
should
fall
into
ruins
and
an
entirely
new
one
arise
conditions
might
prevail
in
another
cosmic
system
to
which
our
present
mathematical
truths
would
not
be
applicable
but
these
would
be
none
the
less
true
in
themselves
it
is
only
when
the
soul
is
alone
with
itself
that
it
can
bring
forth
these
eternal
truths
it
is
at
these
times
related
to
the
true
and
eternal
and
not
to
the
ephemeral
and
apparent
hence
socrates
says
when
the
soul
returning
into
itself
reflects
it
goes
straight
to
what
is
pure
and
everlasting
and
immortal
and
like
unto
itself
and
being
related
to
this
cleaves
unto
it
when
the
soul
is
alone
and
is
not
hindered
and
then
the
soul
rests
from
its
mistakes
and
is
like
unto
itself
even
as
the
eternal
is
with
whom
the
soul
is
now
in
touch
this
state
of
soul
is
called
wisdom
look
now
whether
it
does
not
follow
from
all
that
has
been
said
that
the
soul
is
most
like
the
divine
immortal
reasonable
unique
indissoluble
what
is
always
the
same
and
like
unto
itself
and
that
on
the
other
hand
the
body
most
resembles
what
is
human
and
mortal
unreasonable
multiform
soluble
never
the
same
nor
remaining
equal
to
itself
if
therefore
this
be
so
the
soul
goes
to
what
is
like
itself
to
the
immaterial
to
the
divine
immortal
reasonable
there
it
attains
to
bliss
freed
from
error
and
ignorance
from
fear
and
undisciplined
love
and
all
other
human
evils
there
it
lives
as
the
initiates
say
for
the
remaining
time
truly
with
god
it
is
not
within
the
scope
of
this
book
to
indicate
all
the
ways
in
which
socrates
leads
his
friends
to
the
eternal
they
all
breathe
the
same
spirit
they
all
tend
to
show
that
man
finds
one
thing
when
he
goes
the
way
of
transitory
and
another
when
his
spirit
is
alone
with
itself
it
is
to
this
original
nature
of
spirit
that
socrates
points
his
hearers
if
they
find
it
they
see
with
their
own
spiritual
eyes
that
it
is
eternal
the
dying
socrates
does
not
prove
the
immortality
of
the
soul
he
simply
lays
bare
the
nature
of
the
soul
and
then
it
comes
to
light
that
growth
and
decay
birth
and
death
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
soul
the
essence
of
the
soul
lies
in
the
true
and
this
can
neither
come
into
being
nor
perish
the
soul
has
no
more
to
do
with
the
becoming
than
the
straight
has
with
the
crooked
but
death
belongs
to
the
becoming
therefore
the
soul
has
nothing
to
do
with
death
must
we
not
say
of
what
is
immortal
that
it
admits
of
mortality
as
little
as
does
the
straight
of
the
crooked
starting
from
this
point
must
we
not
ask
adds
socrates
that
if
the
immortal
is
imperishable
is
it
not
impossible
for
the
soul
to
come
to
an
end
when
death
arrives
for
from
what
has
been
already
shown
it
does
not
admit
of
death
nor
can
it
die
any
more
than
three
can
be
an
even
number
let
us
review
the
whole
development
of
this
dialogue
in
which
socrates
brings
his
hearers
to
behold
the
eternal
in
human
personality
the
hearers
accept
his
thoughts
and
they
look
into
themselves
to
see
if
they
can
find
in
their
inner
experiences
something
which
assents
to
his
ideas
they
make
the
objections
which
strike
them
what
has
happened
to
the
hearers
when
the
dialogue
is
finished
they
have
found
something
within
them
which
they
did
not
possess
before
they
have
not
merely
accepted
an
abstract
truth
but
they
have
gone
through
a
development
something
has
come
to
life
in
them
which
was
not
living
in
them
before
is
not
this
to
be
compared
with
an
initiation
and
does
not
this
throw
light
on
the
reason
for
plato
setting
forth
his
philosophy
in
the
form
of
conversation
these
dialogues
are
nothing
else
than
the
literary
form
of
the
events
which
took
place
in
the
sanctuaries
of
the
mysteries
we
are
convinced
of
this
from
what
plato
himself
says
in
many
passages
plato
wished
to
be
as
a
philosophical
teacher
what
the
initiator
into
the
mysteries
was
as
far
as
this
was
compatible
with
the
philosophical
manner
of
communication
it
is
evident
how
plato
feels
himself
in
harmony
with
the
mysteries
he
only
thinks
he
is
on
the
right
path
when
it
is
taking
him
where
the
mystic
is
to
be
led
he
thus
expresses
himself
on
the
subject
in
the
timæus
all
those
who
are
of
right
mind
invoke
the
gods
for
their
small
or
great
enterprises
but
we
who
are
engaged
in
teaching
about
the
universe
how
far
it
is
created
and
uncreated
have
the
special
duty
if
we
have
not
quite
lost
our
way
to
call
upon
and
implore
the
gods
and
goddesses
that
we
may
teach
everything
first
in
conformity
with
their
spirit
and
next
in
harmony
with
ourselves
and
plato
promises
those
who
follow
this
path
that
divinity
as
a
deliverer
will
grant
them
illuminating
teaching
as
the
conclusion
of
their
devious
and
wandering
researches
it
is
especially
the
that
reveals
to
us
how
the
platonic
cosmogony
is
connected
with
the
mysteries
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
dialogue
there
is
mention
of
an
initiation
solon
is
initiated
by
an
egyptian
priest
into
the
formation
of
the
worlds
and
the
way
in
which
eternal
truths
are
symbolically
expressed
in
traditional
myths
there
have
already
been
many
and
various
destructions
of
part
of
the
human
race
says
the
egyptian
priest
to
solon
and
there
will
be
more
in
the
future
the
most
extensive
by
fire
and
water
other
lesser
ones
through
countless
other
causes
it
is
also
related
in
your
country
that
phaëthon
the
son
of
helios
once
mounted
his
chariot
and
as
he
did
not
know
how
to
drive
it
everything
on
the
earth
was
burnt
up
and
he
himself
slain
by
lightning
this
sounds
like
a
fable
but
it
contains
the
truth
of
the
change
in
the
movements
of
the
celestial
bodies
revolving
round
the
earth
and
of
the
annihilation
of
everything
on
the
earth
by
much
fire
this
annihilation
happens
periodically
after
the
lapse
of
certain
long
periods
of
time
this
passage
in
the
contains
a
plain
indication
of
the
attitude
of
the
initiate
towards
he
recognises
the
truths
hidden
in
their
images
the
drama
of
the
formation
of
the
world
is
brought
before
us
in
the
any
one
who
will
follow
up
the
traces
which
lead
to
this
formation
of
the
cosmos
arrives
at
a
dim
apprehension
of
the
primordial
force
from
which
all
things
proceeded
now
it
is
difficult
to
find
the
creator
and
father
of
the
universe
and
when
we
have
found
him
it
is
impossible
to
speak
about
him
so
that
all
may
understand
the
mystic
knew
what
this
impossibility
means
it
points
to
the
divine
drama
god
is
not
present
in
what
belongs
merely
to
the
senses
and
understanding
in
those
he
is
only
present
as
nature
he
is
under
a
spell
in
nature
only
one
who
awakens
the
divine
within
himself
is
able
to
approach
him
thus
he
can
not
at
once
be
made
comprehensible
to
all
but
even
to
one
who
approaches
him
he
does
not
appear
himself
the
says
that
also
the
father
made
the
universe
out
of
the
body
and
soul
of
the
world
he
mixed
together
in
harmony
and
perfect
proportions
the
elements
which
came
into
being
when
he
pouring
himself
out
gave
up
his
separate
existence
thereby
the
body
of
the
world
came
into
being
and
stretched
upon
it
in
the
form
of
a
cross
is
the
soul
of
the
world
it
is
what
is
divine
in
the
world
it
found
the
death
of
the
cross
so
that
the
world
might
come
into
existence
plato
may
therefore
call
nature
the
tomb
of
the
divine
a
grave
however
in
which
nothing
dead
lies
but
the
eternal
to
which
death
only
gives
the
opportunity
of
bringing
into
expression
the
omnipotence
of
life
and
man
sees
nature
in
the
right
light
when
he
approaches
it
in
order
to
release
the
crucified
soul
of
the
world
it
must
rise
again
from
its
death
from
its
spell
where
can
it
come
to
life
again
only
in
the
soul
of
initiated
man
then
wisdom
finds
its
right
relation
to
the
cosmos
the
resurrection
the
liberation
of
god
that
is
wisdom
in
the
the
development
of
the
world
is
traced
from
the
imperfect
to
the
perfect
an
ascending
process
is
represented
imaginatively
beings
are
developed
god
reveals
himself
in
their
development
evolution
is
the
resurrection
of
god
from
the
tomb
within
evolution
man
appears
plato
shows
that
in
man
there
is
something
special
it
is
true
the
whole
world
is
divine
and
man
is
not
more
divine
than
other
beings
but
in
other
beings
god
is
present
in
a
hidden
way
in
man
he
is
manifest
at
the
end
of
the
we
read
and
now
we
might
assert
that
our
study
of
the
universe
has
attained
its
end
for
after
the
world
was
provided
and
filled
with
mortal
and
immortal
living
beings
it
this
one
and
only
begotten
world
has
itself
become
a
visible
being
embracing
everything
visible
and
an
image
of
the
creator
it
has
become
the
god
perceptible
to
the
senses
and
the
greatest
and
best
world
the
fairest
and
most
perfect
which
there
could
be
but
this
one
and
only
begotten
world
would
not
be
perfect
if
the
image
of
its
creator
were
not
to
be
found
amongst
the
images
it
contains
this
image
can
only
be
engendered
in
the
human
soul
not
the
father
himself
but
the
son
god
offspring
living
in
the
soul
and
being
like
unto
the
father
him
man
can
bring
forth
philo
of
whom
it
was
said
that
he
was
the
resurrected
plato
characterised
as
the
son
of
god
the
wisdom
born
out
of
man
which
lives
in
the
soul
and
contains
the
reason
existing
in
the
world
this
cosmic
reason
or
logos
appears
as
the
book
in
which
everything
in
the
world
is
recorded
and
delineated
it
also
appears
as
the
son
of
god
following
in
the
paths
of
the
father
and
creating
forms
looking
at
their
archetypes
the
platonising
philo
addresses
this
logos
as
christ
as
god
is
the
first
and
only
king
of
the
universe
the
way
to
him
is
rightly
called
the
road
consider
this
road
to
be
philosophy
the
road
which
the
company
of
the
ancient
ascetics
took
who
turned
away
from
the
entangling
fascination
of
pleasure
and
devoted
themselves
to
the
noble
and
earnest
cultivation
of
the
beautiful
the
law
names
this
royal
road
which
we
call
true
philosophy
god
word
and
spirit
it
is
like
an
initiation
to
philo
when
he
enters
upon
this
path
in
order
to
meet
the
logos
who
to
him
is
the
son
of
god
i
do
not
shrink
from
relating
what
has
happened
to
me
innumerable
times
often
when
i
wished
to
put
my
philosophical
thoughts
in
writing
in
my
accustomed
way
and
saw
quite
clearly
what
was
to
be
set
down
i
nevertheless
found
my
mind
barren
and
rigid
so
that
i
was
obliged
to
desist
without
having
accomplished
anything
and
seemed
to
be
hampered
with
idle
fancies
at
the
same
time
i
could
not
but
marvel
at
the
power
of
the
reality
of
thought
with
which
it
rests
to
open
and
to
close
the
womb
of
the
human
soul
another
time
however
i
would
begin
empty
and
arrive
without
any
trouble
at
fulness
thoughts
came
flying
like
snowflakes
or
grains
of
corn
invisibly
from
above
and
it
was
as
though
divine
power
took
hold
of
me
and
inspired
me
so
that
i
did
not
know
where
i
was
who
was
with
me
who
i
was
or
what
i
was
saying
or
writing
for
just
then
the
flow
of
ideas
was
given
me
a
delightful
clearness
keen
insight
and
lucid
mastery
of
material
as
if
the
inner
eye
were
able
to
see
everything
with
the
greatest
distinctness
this
is
a
description
of
a
path
to
knowledge
so
expressed
that
we
see
that
any
one
taking
this
path
is
conscious
of
flowing
in
one
current
with
the
divine
when
the
logos
becomes
alive
within
him
this
is
also
expressed
clearly
in
the
words
when
the
spirit
moved
by
love
takes
its
flight
into
the
most
holy
soaring
joyously
on
divine
wings
it
forgets
everything
else
and
itself
it
only
clings
to
and
is
filled
with
that
of
which
it
is
the
satellite
and
servant
and
to
this
it
offers
the
incense
of
the
most
sacred
and
chaste
virtue
there
are
only
two
ways
for
philo
either
man
follows
the
world
of
sense
that
is
what
observation
and
intellect
offer
in
which
case
he
limits
himself
to
his
personality
and
withdraws
from
the
cosmos
or
he
becomes
conscious
of
the
universal
cosmic
force
and
experiences
the
eternal
within
his
personality
he
who
wishes
to
escape
from
god
falls
into
his
own
hands
for
there
are
two
things
to
be
considered
the
universal
spirit
which
is
god
and
one
own
spirit
the
latter
flees
to
and
takes
refuge
in
the
universal
spirit
for
one
who
goes
beyond
his
own
spirit
says
that
it
is
nothing
and
connects
everything
with
god
but
one
who
avoids
god
abolishes
the
first
cause
and
makes
himself
the
cause
of
everything
which
happens
the
platonic
view
of
the
universe
sets
out
to
be
knowledge
which
by
its
very
nature
is
also
religion
it
brings
knowledge
into
relation
with
the
highest
to
which
man
can
attain
through
his
feelings
plato
will
only
allow
knowledge
to
hold
good
when
feeling
may
be
completely
satisfied
in
it
it
is
then
more
than
science
it
is
the
substance
of
life
it
is
a
higher
man
within
man
that
man
of
which
the
personality
is
only
an
image
within
man
is
born
a
being
who
surpasses
him
a
primordial
archetypal
man
and
this
is
another
secret
of
the
mysteries
brought
to
expression
in
the
platonic
philosophy
hippolytus
one
of
the
early
fathers
alludes
to
this
secret
this
is
the
great
secret
of
the
samothracians
who
were
guardians
of
a
certain
which
can
not
be
expressed
and
which
only
the
initiates
know
but
these
latter
speak
in
detail
of
adam
as
the
primordial
archetypal
man
the
platonic
on
or
the
also
represents
an
initiation
here
love
appears
as
the
herald
of
wisdom
if
wisdom
the
eternal
word
the
logos
is
the
son
of
the
eternal
creator
of
the
cosmos
love
is
related
to
the
logos
as
a
mother
before
even
a
spark
of
the
light
of
wisdom
can
flash
up
in
the
human
soul
a
dim
impulse
or
desire
for
the
divine
must
be
present
in
it
unconsciously
the
divine
must
draw
man
to
what
afterwards
when
raised
into
his
consciousness
constitutes
his
supreme
happiness
what
heraclitus
calls
the
daimon
in
man
see
is
connected
with
the
idea
of
love
in
the
people
of
the
most
various
ranks
and
views
of
life
speak
about
love
the
ordinary
man
the
politician
the
scientific
man
the
satiric
poet
aristophanes
and
the
tragic
poet
agathon
they
each
have
their
own
view
of
love
in
keeping
with
their
different
experiences
of
life
the
way
in
which
they
express
themselves
shows
the
stage
at
which
their
daimon
has
arrived
by
love
one
being
is
attracted
to
another
the
multiplicity
the
diversity
of
the
things
into
which
divine
unity
was
poured
aspires
towards
unity
and
harmony
through
love
thus
love
has
something
divine
in
it
and
owing
to
this
each
individual
can
only
understand
it
as
far
as
he
participates
in
the
divine
after
these
men
and
others
at
different
degrees
of
maturity
have
given
utterance
to
their
ideas
about
love
socrates
takes
up
the
word
he
considers
love
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
man
in
search
of
knowledge
for
him
it
is
not
a
divinity
but
it
is
something
which
leads
man
to
god
eros
or
love
is
for
him
not
divine
for
a
god
is
perfect
and
therefore
possesses
the
beautiful
and
good
but
eros
is
only
the
desire
for
the
beautiful
and
good
he
thus
stands
between
man
and
god
he
is
a
daimon
a
mediator
between
the
earthly
and
the
divine
it
is
significant
that
socrates
does
not
claim
to
be
giving
his
own
thoughts
when
speaking
of
love
he
says
he
is
only
relating
what
a
woman
once
imparted
to
him
as
a
revelation
it
was
through
mantic
art
that
he
came
to
his
conception
of
love
diotima
the
priestess
awakened
in
socrates
the
daimonic
force
which
was
to
lead
him
to
the
divine
she
initiated
him
this
passage
in
the
is
highly
suggestive
who
is
the
wise
woman
who
awakened
the
daimon
in
socrates
she
is
more
than
a
merely
poetic
mode
of
expression
for
no
wise
woman
on
the
physical
plane
could
awaken
the
daimon
in
the
soul
unless
the
daimonic
force
were
latent
in
the
soul
itself
it
is
surely
in
socrates
own
soul
that
we
must
also
look
for
this
wise
woman
but
there
must
be
a
reason
why
that
which
brings
the
daimon
to
life
within
the
soul
should
appear
as
an
outward
being
on
the
physical
plane
the
force
can
not
work
in
the
same
way
as
the
forces
which
may
be
observed
in
the
soul
as
belonging
to
and
native
to
it
we
see
that
it
is
the
which
precedes
the
coming
of
wisdom
which
socrates
represents
as
a
wise
woman
it
is
the
which
gives
birth
to
the
son
of
god
wisdom
the
logos
the
unconscious
which
brings
the
divine
into
the
consciousness
is
here
represented
as
the
feminine
element
the
soul
which
as
yet
is
without
wisdom
is
the
mother
of
what
leads
to
the
divine
this
brings
us
to
an
important
conception
of
mysticism
the
soul
is
recognised
as
the
mother
of
the
divine
unconsciously
it
leads
man
to
the
divine
with
the
inevitableness
of
a
natural
force
this
conception
throws
light
on
the
view
of
greek
mythology
taken
in
the
mysteries
the
world
of
the
gods
is
born
in
the
soul
man
looks
upon
what
he
creates
in
images
as
his
gods
but
he
must
force
his
way
through
to
another
conception
he
must
transmute
into
divine
images
the
divine
force
which
is
active
within
him
before
the
creation
of
those
images
behind
the
divine
appears
the
mother
of
the
divine
which
is
nothing
else
than
the
original
force
of
the
human
soul
thus
side
by
side
with
the
gods
man
represents
goddesses
let
us
look
at
the
myth
of
dionysos
in
this
light
dionysos
is
the
son
of
zeus
and
a
mortal
mother
semele
zeus
wrests
the
still
immature
child
from
its
mother
when
she
is
slain
by
lightning
and
shelters
it
in
his
own
side
till
it
is
ready
to
be
born
hera
the
mother
of
the
gods
incites
the
titans
against
dionysos
and
they
tear
him
in
pieces
but
pallas
athene
rescues
his
heart
which
is
still
beating
and
brings
it
to
zeus
out
of
it
he
engenders
his
son
for
the
second
time
in
this
myth
we
can
accurately
trace
a
process
which
is
enacted
in
the
depths
of
the
human
soul
interpreting
it
in
the
manner
of
the
egyptian
priest
who
instructed
solon
about
the
nature
of
myths
we
might
say
it
is
related
that
dionysos
was
the
son
of
a
god
and
of
a
mortal
mother
that
he
was
torn
in
pieces
and
afterwards
born
again
this
sounds
like
a
fable
but
it
contains
the
truth
of
the
birth
of
the
divine
and
its
destiny
in
the
human
soul
the
divine
unites
itself
with
the
earthly
temporal
human
soul
as
soon
as
the
divine
dionysiac
element
stirs
within
the
soul
it
feels
a
violent
desire
for
its
own
true
spiritual
form
ordinary
consciousness
which
once
again
appears
in
the
form
of
a
female
goddess
hera
becomes
jealous
at
the
birth
of
the
divine
out
of
the
higher
consciousness
it
arouses
the
lower
nature
of
man
the
titans
the
still
immature
divine
child
is
torn
in
pieces
thus
the
divine
child
is
present
in
man
as
intellectual
science
broken
up
but
if
there
be
enough
of
the
higher
wisdom
zeus
in
man
to
be
active
it
nurses
and
cherishes
the
immature
child
which
is
then
born
again
as
a
second
son
of
god
dionysos
thus
from
science
which
is
the
fragmentary
divine
force
in
man
is
born
undivided
wisdom
which
is
the
logos
the
son
of
god
and
of
a
mortal
mother
of
the
perishable
human
soul
which
unconsciously
aspires
after
the
divine
as
long
as
we
see
in
all
this
merely
a
process
in
the
soul
and
look
upon
it
as
a
picture
of
this
process
we
are
a
long
way
from
the
spiritual
reality
which
is
enacted
in
it
in
this
spiritual
reality
the
soul
is
not
merely
experiencing
something
in
itself
but
it
has
been
released
from
itself
and
is
taking
part
in
a
cosmic
event
which
is
not
enacted
within
the
soul
in
reality
but
outside
it
platonic
wisdom
and
greek
myths
are
closely
linked
together
so
too
are
the
myths
and
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
the
created
gods
were
the
object
of
popular
religion
the
history
of
their
origin
was
the
secret
of
the
mysteries
no
wonder
that
it
was
held
to
be
dangerous
to
betray
the
mysteries
for
thereby
the
origin
of
the
gods
of
the
people
was
betrayed
and
a
right
understanding
of
that
origin
is
salutary
a
misunderstanding
is
injurious
v
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
and
the
myth
the
mystic
sought
forces
and
beings
within
himself
which
are
unknown
to
man
as
long
as
he
remains
in
the
ordinary
attitude
towards
life
the
mystic
puts
the
great
question
about
his
own
spiritual
forces
and
the
laws
which
transcend
the
lower
nature
a
man
of
ordinary
views
of
life
bounded
by
the
senses
and
logic
creates
gods
for
himself
or
when
he
gets
to
the
point
of
seeing
that
he
has
made
them
he
disclaims
them
the
mystic
knows
that
he
creates
gods
he
knows
why
he
creates
them
he
sees
so
to
say
behind
the
natural
law
which
makes
man
create
them
it
is
as
though
a
plant
suddenly
became
conscious
and
learned
the
laws
of
its
growth
and
development
as
it
is
it
develops
in
lovely
unconsciousness
if
it
knew
about
the
laws
of
its
own
being
its
relation
to
itself
would
be
completely
changed
what
the
lyric
poet
feels
when
he
sings
about
a
plant
what
the
botanist
thinks
when
he
investigates
its
laws
this
would
hover
before
a
conscious
plant
as
an
ideal
of
itself
it
is
thus
with
the
mystic
with
regard
to
the
laws
the
forces
working
within
him
as
one
who
knew
he
was
forced
to
create
something
divine
beyond
himself
and
the
initiates
took
up
the
same
attitude
to
that
which
the
people
had
created
beyond
nature
that
is
to
the
world
of
popular
gods
and
myths
they
wanted
to
penetrate
the
laws
of
this
world
of
gods
and
myths
where
the
people
saw
the
form
of
a
god
or
a
myth
they
looked
for
a
higher
truth
let
us
take
an
example
the
athenians
had
been
forced
by
the
cretan
king
minos
to
deliver
up
to
him
every
eight
years
seven
boys
and
seven
girls
these
were
thrown
as
food
to
a
terrible
monster
the
minotaur
when
the
mournful
tribute
was
to
be
paid
for
the
third
time
the
king
son
theseus
accompanied
it
to
crete
on
his
arrival
there
ariadne
the
daughter
of
minos
interested
herself
in
him
the
minotaur
dwelt
in
the
labyrinth
a
maze
from
which
no
one
could
extricate
himself
who
had
once
got
in
theseus
desired
to
deliver
his
native
city
from
the
shameful
tribute
for
this
purpose
he
had
to
enter
the
labyrinth
into
which
the
monster
booty
was
usually
thrown
and
to
kill
the
minotaur
he
undertook
the
task
overcame
the
formidable
foe
and
succeeded
in
regaining
the
open
air
with
the
aid
of
a
ball
of
thread
which
ariadne
had
given
him
the
mystic
had
to
discover
how
the
creative
human
mind
comes
to
weave
such
a
story
as
the
botanist
watches
the
growth
of
plants
in
order
to
discover
its
laws
so
did
the
mystic
watch
the
creative
spirit
he
sought
for
a
truth
a
nucleus
of
wisdom
where
the
people
had
invented
a
myth
sallust
discloses
to
us
the
attitude
of
a
mystical
sage
towards
a
myth
of
this
kind
we
might
call
the
whole
world
a
myth
says
he
which
contains
bodies
and
things
visibly
and
souls
and
spirits
in
a
hidden
manner
if
the
truth
about
the
gods
were
taught
to
all
the
unintelligent
would
disdain
it
from
not
understanding
it
and
the
more
capable
would
make
light
of
it
but
if
the
truth
is
given
in
a
mystical
veil
it
is
assured
against
contempt
and
serves
as
a
stimulus
to
philosophic
thinking
when
the
truth
contained
in
a
myth
was
sought
by
an
initiate
he
was
conscious
of
adding
something
which
did
not
exist
in
the
consciousness
of
the
people
he
was
aware
of
being
above
that
consciousness
as
a
botanist
is
above
a
growing
plant
something
was
expressed
which
was
different
from
what
was
present
in
the
mythical
consciousness
but
it
was
looked
upon
as
a
deeper
truth
symbolically
expressed
in
the
myth
man
is
confronted
with
his
own
in
the
form
of
a
hostile
monster
he
sacrifices
to
it
the
fruits
of
his
personality
and
the
monster
devours
them
and
continues
to
do
so
till
the
conqueror
theseus
awakes
in
man
his
intuition
spins
the
thread
by
means
of
which
he
finds
his
way
again
when
he
repairs
to
the
maze
of
the
senses
in
order
to
slay
his
enemy
the
mystery
of
human
knowledge
itself
is
expressed
in
this
conquering
of
the
senses
the
initiate
knows
that
mystery
it
points
to
a
force
in
human
personality
unknown
to
ordinary
consciousness
but
nevertheless
active
within
it
it
is
the
force
which
creates
the
myth
which
has
the
same
structure
as
mystical
truth
this
truth
finds
its
symbol
in
the
myth
what
then
is
to
be
found
in
the
myths
in
them
is
a
creation
of
the
spirit
of
the
unconsciously
creative
soul
the
soul
has
laws
in
order
to
create
beyond
itself
it
must
work
in
a
certain
direction
at
the
mythological
stage
it
does
this
in
images
but
these
are
built
up
according
to
the
laws
of
the
soul
we
might
also
say
that
when
the
soul
advances
beyond
the
stage
of
mythological
consciousness
to
deeper
truths
these
bear
the
same
stamp
as
did
the
myths
for
one
and
the
same
force
was
at
work
in
their
formation
plotinus
the
philosopher
of
the
school
speaks
of
this
relation
of
mythical
representation
to
higher
knowledge
in
reference
to
the
of
egypt
whether
as
the
result
of
rigorous
investigations
or
whether
instinctively
when
imparting
their
wisdom
the
egyptian
sages
do
not
use
for
expressing
their
teaching
and
precepts
written
signs
which
are
imitations
of
voice
and
speech
but
they
draw
pictures
and
in
the
outlines
of
these
they
record
in
their
temples
the
thought
contained
in
each
thing
so
that
every
picture
contains
knowledge
and
wisdom
and
is
a
definite
truth
and
a
complete
whole
although
there
is
no
explanation
nor
discussion
afterwards
the
contents
of
the
picture
are
drawn
out
of
it
and
expressed
in
words
and
the
cause
is
found
why
it
is
as
it
is
and
not
otherwise
if
we
wish
to
find
out
the
connection
of
mysticism
with
mythical
narratives
we
must
see
what
relationship
to
them
there
is
in
the
views
of
the
great
thinkers
those
who
knew
their
wisdom
to
be
in
harmony
with
the
methods
of
the
mysteries
we
find
such
harmony
in
plato
in
the
fullest
degree
his
explanations
of
myths
and
his
application
of
them
in
his
teaching
may
be
taken
as
a
model
in
the
a
dialogue
on
the
soul
the
myth
of
boreas
is
introduced
this
divine
being
who
was
seen
in
the
rushing
wind
one
day
saw
the
fair
orithyia
daughter
of
the
attic
king
erectheus
gathering
flowers
with
her
companions
seized
with
love
for
her
he
carried
her
off
to
his
grotto
plato
by
the
mouth
of
socrates
rejects
a
rationalist
interpretation
of
this
myth
according
to
this
explanation
an
outward
natural
fact
is
poetically
symbolised
by
the
narrative
a
hurricane
seized
the
king
daughter
and
hurled
her
over
the
rocks
interpretations
of
this
sort
says
socrates
are
learned
sophistries
however
popular
and
usual
they
may
be
for
one
who
has
pulled
to
pieces
one
of
these
mythological
forms
must
to
be
consistent
elucidate
sceptically
and
explain
naturally
all
the
rest
in
the
same
way
but
even
if
such
a
labour
could
be
accomplished
it
would
in
any
case
be
no
proof
of
superior
talents
in
the
one
carrying
it
out
but
only
of
superficial
wit
boorish
wisdom
and
ridiculous
haste
therefore
i
leave
on
one
side
all
such
enquiries
and
believe
what
is
generally
thought
about
the
myths
i
do
not
examine
them
as
i
have
just
said
but
i
examine
myself
to
see
whether
i
too
may
perhaps
be
a
monster
more
complicated
and
therefore
more
disordered
than
the
chimæra
more
savage
than
typhon
or
whether
i
represent
a
more
docile
and
simple
being
to
whom
some
particle
of
a
virtuous
and
divine
nature
has
been
given
we
see
from
this
that
plato
does
not
approve
of
a
rationalistic
and
merely
intellectual
interpretation
of
myths
this
attitude
must
be
compared
with
the
way
in
which
he
himself
uses
myths
in
order
to
express
himself
through
them
when
he
speaks
of
the
life
of
the
soul
when
he
leaves
the
paths
of
the
transitory
and
seeks
the
eternal
in
the
soul
when
therefore
images
borrowed
from
and
reasoning
thought
can
no
longer
be
used
then
plato
has
recourse
to
the
myth
treats
of
the
eternal
in
the
soul
which
is
portrayed
as
a
car
drawn
by
two
horses
winged
all
over
and
driven
by
a
charioteer
one
horse
is
patient
and
docile
the
other
wild
and
headstrong
if
an
obstacle
comes
in
the
way
of
the
car
the
troublesome
horse
takes
the
opportunity
of
impeding
the
docile
one
and
defying
the
driver
when
the
car
arrives
where
it
has
to
follow
the
gods
up
the
celestial
steep
the
intractable
horse
throws
the
team
into
confusion
if
it
is
less
strong
than
the
good
horse
it
is
overcome
and
the
car
is
able
to
go
on
into
the
supersensible
realm
it
thus
happens
that
the
soul
can
never
ascend
without
difficulties
into
the
kingdom
of
the
divine
some
souls
rise
more
to
the
vision
of
eternity
some
less
the
soul
which
has
seen
the
world
beyond
remains
safe
until
the
next
journey
one
who
on
account
of
the
intractable
horse
has
not
seen
beyond
must
try
again
on
the
next
journey
these
journeys
signify
the
various
incarnations
of
the
soul
one
journey
signifies
the
life
of
the
soul
in
one
personality
the
wild
horse
represents
the
lower
nature
the
docile
one
the
higher
nature
the
driver
the
soul
longing
for
union
with
the
divine
plato
resorts
to
the
myth
in
order
to
describe
the
course
of
the
eternal
spirit
through
its
various
transformations
in
the
same
way
he
has
recourse
in
other
writings
to
symbolical
narrative
in
order
to
portray
the
inner
nature
of
man
which
is
not
perceptible
to
the
senses
plato
is
here
in
complete
harmony
with
the
mythical
and
allegorical
manner
of
expression
used
by
others
for
instance
there
is
in
ancient
hindu
literature
a
parable
attributed
to
buddha
a
man
very
much
attached
to
life
who
seeks
sensuous
pleasures
and
will
die
at
no
price
is
pursued
by
four
serpents
he
hears
a
voice
commanding
him
to
feed
and
bathe
the
serpents
from
time
to
time
the
man
runs
away
fearing
the
serpents
again
he
hears
a
voice
warning
him
that
he
is
pursued
by
five
murderers
once
more
he
escapes
a
voice
calls
his
attention
to
a
sixth
murderer
who
is
about
to
behead
him
with
a
sword
again
he
flees
he
comes
to
a
deserted
village
there
he
hears
a
voice
telling
him
that
robbers
are
shortly
going
to
plunder
the
village
having
again
escaped
he
comes
to
a
great
flood
he
feels
unsafe
where
he
is
and
out
of
straw
wood
and
leaves
he
makes
a
basket
in
which
he
arrives
at
the
other
shore
now
he
is
safe
he
is
a
brahmin
the
meaning
of
this
allegory
is
that
man
has
to
pass
through
the
most
various
states
before
attaining
to
the
divine
the
four
serpents
represent
the
four
elements
fire
water
earth
and
air
the
five
murderers
are
the
five
senses
the
deserted
village
is
the
soul
which
has
escaped
from
but
is
not
yet
safe
if
it
is
alone
with
itself
for
if
its
lower
nature
lays
hold
of
it
it
must
perish
man
must
construct
for
himself
the
boat
which
is
to
carry
him
over
the
flood
of
the
transitory
from
the
one
shore
the
to
the
other
the
eternal
divine
world
let
us
look
at
the
egyptian
mystery
of
osiris
in
this
light
osiris
had
gradually
become
one
of
the
most
important
egyptian
divinities
he
supplanted
other
gods
in
certain
parts
of
the
country
and
an
important
cycle
of
myths
was
formed
round
him
and
his
consort
isis
osiris
was
the
son
of
the
his
brother
was
and
his
sister
was
isis
osiris
married
his
sister
and
together
they
reigned
over
egypt
the
wicked
brother
typhon
meditated
killing
osiris
he
had
a
chest
made
which
was
exactly
the
length
of
osiris
body
at
a
banquet
this
chest
was
offered
to
the
person
whom
it
exactly
fitted
this
was
osiris
and
none
other
he
entered
the
chest
typhon
and
his
confederates
rushed
upon
him
closed
the
chest
and
threw
it
into
the
river
when
isis
heard
the
terrible
news
she
wandered
far
and
wide
in
despair
seeking
her
husband
body
when
she
had
found
it
typhon
again
took
possession
of
it
and
tore
it
in
fourteen
pieces
which
were
dispersed
in
many
different
places
various
tombs
of
osiris
were
shown
in
egypt
in
many
places
up
and
down
the
country
portions
of
the
god
were
said
to
be
buried
osiris
himself
however
came
forth
from
the
and
vanquished
typhon
a
beam
shone
from
him
upon
isis
who
in
consequence
bore
a
son
harpocrates
or
horus
and
now
let
us
compare
this
myth
with
the
view
which
the
greek
philosopher
empedocles
takes
of
the
universe
he
assumes
that
the
one
original
primeval
being
was
once
broken
up
into
the
four
elements
fire
water
earth
and
air
or
into
the
multiplicity
of
being
he
represents
two
opposing
forces
which
within
this
world
of
existence
bring
about
growth
and
decay
love
and
strife
empedocles
says
of
the
elements
they
remain
ever
the
same
but
yet
by
combining
their
forces
become
transformed
into
men
and
the
numberless
beings
besides
these
are
now
joined
into
one
love
binding
the
many
together
now
once
again
they
are
scattered
dispersing
through
hatred
and
strife
what
then
are
the
things
in
the
world
from
empedocles
point
of
view
they
are
the
elements
in
different
combinations
they
could
only
come
into
being
because
the
primeval
unity
was
broken
up
into
the
four
essences
therefore
this
primordial
unity
was
poured
into
the
elements
anything
confronting
us
is
part
of
the
divinity
which
was
poured
out
but
the
divinity
is
hidden
in
the
thing
it
first
had
to
die
that
things
might
come
into
being
and
what
are
these
things
mixtures
of
divine
constituents
effectuated
by
love
and
hatred
empedocles
says
this
distinctly
see
for
a
clear
demonstration
how
the
limbs
of
a
man
are
constructed
all
that
the
body
possesses
in
beauty
and
pride
of
existence
all
put
together
by
love
are
the
elements
there
forming
one
afterwards
hatred
and
strife
come
and
fatally
tear
them
asunder
once
more
they
wander
alone
on
the
desolate
confines
of
life
so
it
is
with
the
bushes
and
trees
and
the
fishes
wild
animals
roaming
the
mountains
and
ships
swiftly
borne
by
their
sails
empedocles
therefore
must
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
sage
finds
again
the
divine
primordial
unity
hidden
in
the
world
by
a
spell
and
entangled
in
the
meshes
of
love
and
hatred
but
if
man
finds
the
divine
he
must
himself
be
divine
for
empedocles
takes
the
point
of
view
that
a
being
is
only
cognised
by
its
equal
this
conviction
of
his
is
expressed
in
goethe
lines
if
the
eye
were
not
of
the
nature
of
the
sun
how
could
we
behold
light
if
divine
force
were
not
at
work
in
us
how
could
divine
things
delight
us
these
thoughts
about
the
world
and
man
which
transcend
were
found
by
the
mystic
in
the
myth
of
osiris
divine
creative
force
has
been
poured
out
into
the
universe
it
appears
as
the
four
elements
god
osiris
is
killed
man
is
to
raise
him
from
the
dead
with
his
cognition
which
is
of
divine
nature
he
is
to
find
him
again
as
horus
the
son
of
god
the
logos
wisdom
in
the
opposition
between
strife
typhon
and
love
isis
empedocles
expresses
his
fundamental
conviction
in
greek
form
by
means
of
images
which
border
on
myth
love
is
aphrodite
and
strife
is
neikos
they
bind
and
unbind
the
elements
the
portrayal
of
the
content
of
a
myth
in
the
manner
followed
here
must
not
be
confused
with
a
merely
symbolical
or
even
allegorical
interpretation
of
myths
this
is
not
intended
the
images
forming
the
contents
of
a
myth
are
not
invented
symbols
of
abstract
truths
but
actual
of
the
initiate
he
experiences
the
images
with
his
spiritual
organs
of
perception
just
as
the
normal
man
experiences
the
images
of
physical
things
with
his
eyes
and
ears
but
as
an
image
is
nothing
in
itself
if
it
is
not
aroused
in
the
perception
by
an
outer
object
so
the
mythical
image
is
nothing
unless
it
is
excited
by
real
facts
of
the
spiritual
world
only
in
regard
to
the
physical
world
man
is
at
first
outside
the
exciting
causes
whereas
he
can
only
experience
the
images
of
myths
when
he
is
within
the
corresponding
spiritual
occurrences
in
order
however
to
be
within
them
he
must
have
gone
through
initiation
then
the
spiritual
occurrences
within
which
he
is
perceiving
are
as
it
were
illustrated
by
the
any
one
who
can
not
take
the
mythical
element
as
such
illustration
of
real
spiritual
occurrences
has
not
yet
attained
to
the
understanding
of
it
for
the
spiritual
events
themselves
are
supersensible
and
images
which
are
reminiscent
of
the
physical
world
are
not
themselves
of
a
spiritual
nature
but
only
an
illustration
of
spiritual
things
one
who
lives
merely
in
the
images
lives
in
a
dream
only
one
who
has
got
to
the
point
of
feeling
the
spiritual
element
in
the
image
as
he
feels
in
the
a
rose
through
the
image
of
a
rose
really
lives
in
spiritual
perceptions
this
is
the
reason
why
the
images
of
myths
can
not
have
only
one
meaning
on
account
of
their
illustrative
character
the
same
myths
may
express
several
spiritual
facts
it
is
not
therefore
a
contradiction
when
interpreters
of
myths
sometimes
connect
a
myth
with
one
spiritual
fact
and
sometimes
with
another
from
this
standpoint
we
are
able
to
find
a
thread
to
conduct
us
through
the
labyrinth
of
greek
myths
let
us
consider
the
legend
of
heracles
the
twelve
labours
imposed
upon
heracles
appear
in
a
higher
light
when
we
remember
that
before
the
last
and
most
difficult
one
he
is
initiated
into
the
eleusinian
mysteries
he
is
commissioned
by
king
eurystheus
of
mycenæ
to
bring
the
cerberus
from
the
infernal
regions
and
take
it
back
there
again
in
order
to
undertake
the
descent
into
hell
heracles
had
to
be
initiated
the
mysteries
conducted
man
through
the
death
of
perishable
things
therefore
into
the
and
by
initiation
they
rescued
his
eternal
part
from
perishing
as
a
mystic
he
could
vanquish
death
heracles
having
become
a
mystic
overcomes
the
dangers
of
the
this
justifies
us
in
interpreting
his
other
ordeals
as
stages
in
the
inner
development
of
the
soul
he
overcomes
the
nemæan
lion
and
brings
him
to
mycenæ
this
means
that
he
becomes
master
of
purely
physical
force
in
man
he
tames
it
afterwards
he
slays
the
hydra
he
overcomes
it
with
firebrands
and
dips
his
arrows
in
its
gall
so
that
they
become
deadly
this
means
that
he
overcomes
lower
knowledge
that
which
comes
through
the
senses
he
does
this
through
the
fire
of
the
spirit
and
from
what
he
has
gained
through
the
lower
knowledge
he
draws
the
power
to
look
at
lower
things
in
the
light
which
belongs
to
spiritual
sight
heracles
captures
the
hind
of
artemis
goddess
of
hunting
everything
which
free
nature
offers
to
the
human
soul
heracles
conquers
and
subdues
the
other
labours
may
be
interpreted
in
the
same
way
we
can
not
here
trace
out
every
detail
and
only
wish
to
describe
how
the
general
sense
of
the
myth
points
to
inner
development
a
similar
interpretation
is
possible
of
the
expedition
of
the
argonauts
phrixus
and
his
sister
helle
children
of
a
boeotian
king
suffered
many
things
from
their
the
gods
sent
them
a
ram
with
a
golden
fleece
which
flew
away
with
them
when
they
came
to
the
straits
between
europe
and
asia
helle
was
drowned
hence
the
strait
is
called
the
hellespont
phrixus
came
to
the
king
of
colchis
on
the
east
shore
of
the
black
sea
he
sacrificed
the
ram
to
the
gods
and
gave
its
fleece
to
king
æetes
the
king
had
it
hung
up
in
a
grove
and
guarded
by
a
terrible
dragon
the
greek
hero
jason
undertook
to
fetch
the
fleece
from
colchis
in
company
with
other
heroes
heracles
theseus
and
orpheus
heavy
tasks
were
laid
upon
jason
by
æetes
for
the
obtaining
of
the
treasure
but
medea
the
king
daughter
who
was
versed
in
magic
aided
him
he
subdued
two
bulls
he
ploughed
a
field
and
sowed
in
it
dragon
teeth
from
which
armed
men
grew
up
out
of
the
earth
by
medea
advice
he
threw
a
stone
into
their
midst
whereupon
they
killed
each
other
jason
lulls
the
dragon
to
sleep
with
a
charm
of
medea
and
is
then
able
to
win
the
fleece
he
returns
with
it
to
greece
medea
accompanying
him
as
his
wife
the
king
pursues
the
fugitives
in
order
to
detain
him
medea
slays
her
little
brother
absyrtus
and
scatters
his
limbs
in
the
sea
æetes
stays
to
collect
them
and
the
pair
are
able
to
reach
jason
home
with
the
fleece
each
of
these
facts
requires
a
deep
elucidation
the
fleece
is
something
belonging
to
man
and
infinitely
precious
to
him
it
is
something
from
which
he
was
separated
in
times
of
yore
and
for
the
recovery
of
which
he
has
to
overcome
terrible
forces
it
is
thus
with
the
eternal
in
the
human
soul
it
belongs
to
man
but
man
is
separated
from
it
by
his
lower
nature
only
by
overcoming
the
latter
and
lulling
it
to
sleep
can
he
recover
the
eternal
this
becomes
possible
when
his
own
consciousness
medea
comes
to
his
aid
with
its
magic
power
medea
is
to
jason
what
diotima
was
to
socrates
a
teacher
of
love
man
own
wisdom
has
the
magic
power
necessary
for
attaining
the
divine
after
having
overcome
the
transitory
from
the
lower
nature
there
can
only
arise
a
lower
human
principle
the
armed
men
who
are
overcome
by
spiritual
force
the
counsel
of
medea
even
when
man
has
found
the
eternal
the
fleece
he
is
not
yet
safe
he
has
to
sacrifice
part
of
his
consciousness
absyrtus
this
is
exacted
by
the
physical
world
which
we
can
only
apprehend
as
a
multiple
dismembered
world
we
might
go
still
deeper
into
the
description
of
the
spiritual
events
lying
behind
the
images
but
it
is
only
intended
here
to
indicate
the
principle
of
the
formation
of
myths
of
special
interest
when
interpreted
in
this
way
is
the
legend
of
prometheus
he
and
his
brother
epimetheus
are
sons
of
the
titan
iapetus
the
titans
are
the
offspring
of
the
oldest
generation
of
gods
uranus
heaven
and
gæa
earth
kronos
the
youngest
of
the
titans
dethroned
his
father
and
seized
upon
the
government
of
the
world
in
return
he
was
overpowered
with
the
other
titans
by
his
son
zeus
who
became
the
chief
of
the
gods
in
the
struggle
with
the
titans
prometheus
was
on
the
side
of
zeus
by
his
advice
zeus
banished
the
titans
to
the
but
in
prometheus
there
still
lived
the
titan
spirit
he
was
only
half
a
friend
to
zeus
when
the
latter
wished
to
exterminate
men
on
account
of
their
arrogance
prometheus
espoused
their
cause
taught
them
numbers
writing
and
everything
else
which
leads
to
culture
especially
the
use
of
fire
this
aroused
the
wrath
of
zeus
against
prometheus
hephaistos
the
son
of
zeus
was
commissioned
to
make
a
female
form
of
great
beauty
whom
the
gods
adorned
with
every
possible
gift
she
was
called
pandora
the
one
hermes
messenger
of
the
gods
brought
her
to
epimetheus
the
brother
of
prometheus
she
brought
him
a
casket
as
a
present
from
the
gods
epimetheus
accepted
the
present
although
prometheus
had
warned
him
against
receiving
any
gift
from
the
gods
when
the
casket
was
opened
every
possible
human
evil
flew
out
of
it
hope
alone
remained
and
this
because
pandora
quickly
closed
the
box
hope
has
therefore
been
left
to
man
as
a
doubtful
gift
of
the
gods
by
order
of
zeus
prometheus
was
chained
to
a
rock
on
the
caucasus
on
account
of
his
relation
to
man
an
eagle
perpetually
gnaws
his
liver
which
is
as
often
renewed
he
has
to
pass
his
life
in
agonising
loneliness
till
one
of
the
gods
voluntarily
sacrifices
himself
devotes
himself
to
death
the
tormented
prometheus
bears
his
sufferings
steadfastly
it
had
been
told
him
that
zeus
would
be
dethroned
by
the
son
of
a
mortal
unless
zeus
consented
to
wed
this
mortal
woman
it
was
important
for
zeus
to
know
this
secret
he
sent
the
messenger
hermes
to
prometheus
in
order
to
learn
something
about
it
prometheus
refused
to
say
anything
the
legend
of
heracles
is
connected
with
that
of
prometheus
in
the
course
of
his
wanderings
heracles
comes
to
the
caucasus
he
slays
the
eagle
which
was
devouring
the
liver
of
prometheus
the
centaur
chiron
who
can
not
die
although
suffering
from
an
incurable
wound
sacrifices
himself
for
prometheus
who
is
thereupon
reconciled
with
the
gods
the
titans
are
the
force
of
will
proceeding
as
nature
kronos
from
the
original
universal
spirit
uranus
here
we
have
to
think
not
merely
of
in
an
abstract
form
but
of
actual
prometheus
is
one
of
them
and
this
describes
his
nature
but
he
is
not
altogether
a
titan
in
a
certain
sense
he
is
on
the
side
of
zeus
the
spirit
who
enters
upon
the
rulership
of
the
world
after
the
unbridled
force
of
nature
kronos
has
been
subdued
prometheus
is
thus
the
representative
of
those
worlds
which
have
given
man
the
progressive
element
half
half
spiritual
force
will
the
will
points
on
the
one
side
towards
good
on
the
other
towards
evil
its
fate
is
decided
according
as
it
leans
to
the
spiritual
or
the
perishable
this
fate
is
that
of
man
himself
he
is
chained
to
the
perishable
the
eagle
gnaws
him
he
has
to
suffer
he
can
only
reach
the
highest
by
seeking
his
destiny
in
solitude
he
has
a
secret
which
is
that
the
divine
zeus
must
marry
a
mortal
human
consciousness
bound
up
with
the
physical
body
in
order
to
beget
a
son
human
wisdom
the
logos
which
will
deliver
the
deity
by
this
means
consciousness
becomes
immortal
he
must
not
betray
this
secret
till
a
mystic
heracles
comes
to
him
and
annihilates
the
power
which
was
perpetually
threatening
him
with
death
a
being
half
animal
half
human
a
centaur
is
obliged
to
sacrifice
itself
to
redeem
man
the
centaur
is
man
himself
half
animal
half
spiritual
he
must
die
in
order
that
the
purely
spiritual
man
may
be
delivered
that
which
is
disdained
by
prometheus
human
will
is
accepted
by
epimetheus
reason
or
prudence
but
the
gifts
offered
to
epimetheus
are
only
troubles
and
sorrows
for
reason
clings
to
the
transitory
and
perishable
and
only
one
thing
is
left
the
hope
that
even
out
of
the
perishable
the
eternal
may
some
day
be
born
the
thread
running
through
the
legends
of
the
argonauts
heracles
and
prometheus
is
continued
in
homer
here
we
find
ourselves
compelled
to
use
our
own
method
of
interpretation
but
on
closer
consideration
of
everything
which
has
to
be
taken
into
account
even
the
sturdiest
doubter
must
lose
all
scruples
about
such
an
interpretation
in
the
first
place
it
is
a
startling
fact
that
it
is
also
related
of
odysseus
that
he
descended
into
the
whatever
we
may
think
about
the
author
of
the
in
other
respects
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
his
representing
a
mortal
descending
to
the
infernal
regions
without
his
bringing
him
into
connection
with
what
the
journey
into
the
meant
to
the
greeks
it
meant
the
conquest
of
the
perishable
and
the
awakening
of
the
eternal
in
the
soul
it
must
therefore
be
conceded
that
odysseus
accomplished
this
and
thereby
his
experiences
and
those
of
heracles
acquire
a
deeper
significance
they
become
a
delineation
of
the
of
the
soul
progress
of
development
hence
the
narrative
in
the
is
different
from
what
is
demanded
by
a
history
of
outer
events
the
hero
makes
voyages
in
enchanted
ships
actual
geographical
distances
are
dealt
with
in
most
arbitrary
fashion
it
is
not
in
the
least
a
question
of
what
is
physically
real
this
becomes
comprehensible
if
the
physically
real
events
are
only
related
for
the
sake
of
illustrating
the
development
of
a
soul
moreover
the
poet
himself
at
the
opening
of
the
book
says
that
it
deals
with
a
search
for
the
soul
o
muse
sing
to
me
of
the
man
full
of
resource
who
wandered
very
much
after
he
had
destroyed
the
sacred
city
of
troy
and
saw
the
cities
of
many
men
and
learned
their
manners
many
griefs
also
in
his
mind
did
he
suffer
on
the
sea
although
seeking
to
preserve
his
own
soul
and
the
return
of
his
companions
we
have
before
us
a
man
seeking
for
the
soul
for
the
divine
and
his
wanderings
during
this
search
are
narrated
he
comes
to
the
land
of
the
cyclopes
these
are
uncouth
giants
with
only
one
eye
and
that
in
the
centre
of
the
forehead
the
most
terrible
polyphemus
devours
several
of
odysseus
companions
odysseus
himself
escapes
by
blinding
the
cyclopes
here
we
have
to
do
with
the
first
stage
of
pilgrimage
physical
force
or
the
lower
nature
has
to
be
overcome
it
devours
any
one
who
does
not
take
away
its
power
who
does
not
blind
it
odysseus
next
comes
to
the
island
of
the
enchantress
circe
she
changes
some
of
his
companions
into
grunting
pigs
she
also
is
subdued
by
odysseus
circe
is
the
lower
which
cleaves
to
the
transitory
if
misused
it
may
thrust
men
down
even
deeper
into
bestiality
odysseus
has
to
overcome
it
then
he
is
able
to
descend
into
the
he
becomes
a
mystic
now
he
is
exposed
to
the
dangers
which
beset
the
mystic
on
his
progress
from
the
lower
to
the
higher
degrees
of
initiation
he
comes
to
the
sirens
who
lure
the
to
death
by
sweet
magic
sounds
these
are
the
forms
of
the
lower
imagination
which
are
at
first
pursued
by
one
who
has
freed
himself
from
the
power
of
the
senses
he
has
got
so
far
that
his
spirit
acts
freely
but
is
not
initiated
he
pursues
illusions
from
the
power
of
which
he
must
break
loose
odysseus
has
to
accomplish
the
awful
passage
between
scylla
and
charybdis
the
mystic
at
the
beginning
of
the
path
wavers
between
spirit
and
sensuousness
he
can
not
yet
grasp
the
full
value
of
spirit
yet
sensuousness
has
already
lost
its
former
attraction
all
odysseus
companions
perish
in
a
shipwreck
he
alone
escapes
and
comes
to
the
nymph
calypso
who
receives
him
kindly
and
takes
care
of
him
for
seven
years
at
length
by
order
of
zeus
she
dismisses
him
to
his
home
the
mystic
has
arrived
at
a
stage
at
which
all
his
fail
he
alone
odysseus
is
worthy
he
enjoys
for
a
time
which
is
defined
by
the
mystically
symbolic
number
seven
the
rest
of
gradual
initiation
before
odysseus
arrives
at
his
home
he
comes
to
the
isle
of
the
phæaces
where
he
meets
with
a
hospitable
reception
the
daughter
gives
him
sympathy
and
the
king
alcinous
entertains
and
honours
him
once
more
does
odysseus
approach
the
world
and
its
joys
and
the
spirit
which
is
attached
to
the
world
nausicaa
awakes
within
him
but
he
finds
the
way
home
to
the
divine
at
first
nothing
good
awaits
him
at
home
his
wife
penelope
is
surrounded
by
numerous
suitors
each
one
she
promises
to
marry
when
she
has
finished
weaving
a
certain
piece
of
work
she
avoids
keeping
her
promise
by
undoing
every
night
what
she
has
woven
by
day
odysseus
is
obliged
to
vanquish
the
suitors
before
he
can
be
reunited
to
his
wife
in
peace
the
goddess
athene
changes
him
into
a
beggar
so
that
he
may
not
be
recognised
at
his
entrance
and
thus
he
overcomes
the
suitors
odysseus
is
seeking
his
own
deeper
consciousness
the
divine
powers
of
the
soul
he
wishes
to
be
united
with
them
before
the
mystic
can
find
them
he
must
overcome
everything
which
sues
for
the
favour
of
that
consciousness
the
band
of
suitors
spring
from
the
world
of
lower
reality
from
perishable
nature
the
logic
directed
against
them
is
a
spinning
which
is
always
undone
again
after
it
has
been
spun
wisdom
the
goddess
athene
is
the
sure
guide
to
the
deepest
powers
of
the
soul
it
changes
man
into
a
beggar
it
divests
him
of
everything
of
a
transitory
nature
the
eleusinian
festivals
which
were
celebrated
in
greece
in
honour
of
demeter
and
dionysos
were
steeped
in
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
a
sacred
road
led
from
athens
to
eleusis
it
was
bordered
with
mysterious
signs
intended
to
bring
the
soul
into
an
exalted
mood
in
eleusis
were
mysterious
temples
served
by
families
of
priests
the
dignity
and
the
wisdom
which
was
bound
up
with

inherited
in

part
the
wisdom
which
qualified
for
the
priesthood
was
the
wisdom
of
the
greek
mysteries
the
festivals
which
were
celebrated
twice
a
year
represented
the
great
of
the
destiny
of
the
divine
in
the
world
and
of
that
of
the
human
soul
the
lesser
mysteries
took
place
in
february
the
greater
in
september
initiations
were
connected
with
the
festivals
the
symbolical
presentation
of
the
cosmic
and
human
drama
formed
the
final
act
of
the
initiations
of
the
mystics
which
took
place
here
the
eleusinian
temples
had
been
erected
in
honour
of
the
goddess
demeter
she
was
a
daughter
of
kronos
she
had
given
to

a
daughter
persephone

marriage
with

persephone
while
playing
was
carried
away
by

demeter
wandered

wide
over

seeking
her
with
lamentations
sitting
on
a
stone
in

she
was
found
by
the

and
for
this
purpose
hid
him
in
fire
every
night
when
his
mother
discovered
this
she
wept
and
lamented
after
that
the
bestowal
of
immortality
was
impossible
demeter
left
the
house
keleus
then
built
a
temple
the
grief
of
demeter
for
persephone
was
limitless
she
spread
sterility
over
the
earth
the
gods
had
to
appease
her
to
prevent
a
great
catastrophe
then
zeus
induced
hades
pluto
to
release
persephone
into
the
upper
world
but
before
letting
her
go
he
gave
her
a
pomegranate
to
eat
this
obliged
her
to
return
periodically
to
the
for
evermore
henceforward
she
spent
a
third
of
the
year
there
and
in
the
world
above
demeter
was
appeased
and
returned
to
olympus
but
at
eleusis
the
place
of
her
suffering
she
founded
the
cult
which
should
keep
her
fate
in
remembrance
it
is
not
difficult
to
discover
the
meaning
of
the
myth
of
demeter
and
persephone
it
is
the
soul
which
lives
alternately
above
and
below
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
its
perpetually
recurring
transformation
by
birth
and
death
are
thus
symbolised
the
soul
originates
from
the
immortal
demeter
but
it
is
led
astray
by
the
transitory
and
even
prevailed
upon
to
share
its
destiny
it
has
partaken
of
the
fruits
in
the
the
human
soul
is
satisfied
with
the
transitory
therefore
it
can
not
permanently
live
in
the
heights
of
the
divine
it
has
always
to
return
to
the
realm
of
the
perishable
demeter
is
the
representative
of
the
essence
from
which
human
consciousness
arose
but
we
must
think
of
it
as
the
consciousness
which
was
able
to
come
into
being
through
the
spiritual
forces
of
the
earth
thus
demeter
is
the
primordial
essence
of
the
earth
and
the
endowment
of
the
earth
with
the
of
the
produce
of
the
fields
through
her
points
to
a
still
deeper
side
of
her
being
this
being
wishes
to
give
man
immortality
she
hides
her
nursling
in
fire
by
night
but
man
can
not
bear
the
pure
force
of
fire
the
spirit
demeter
is
obliged
to
abandon
the
idea
she
is
only
able
to
found
a
temple
service
through
which
man
is
able
to
participate
in
the
divine
as
far
as
this
is
possible
the
eleusinian
festivals
were
an
eloquent
confession
of
the
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
human
soul
this
confession
found
symbolic
expression
in
the
persephone
myth
together
with
demeter
and
persephone
dionysos
was
commemorated
in
eleusis
as
demeter
was
honoured
as
the
divine
creatress
of
the
eternal
in
man
so
in
dionysos
was
honoured
the
divine
in
the
world
the
divine
poured
into
the
world
and
torn
to
pieces
in
order
to
be
spiritually
reborn
had
to
be
honoured
together
with
demeter
a
brilliant
description
of
the
spirit
of
the
eleusinian
mysteries
is
found
in
edouard
schuré
book
paris
vi
the
mystery
wisdom
of
egypt
when
leaving
thy
body
behind
thee
thou
soarest
into
the
ether
then
thou
becomest
a
god
immortal
not
subject
to
death
in
this
utterance
of
empedocles
is
epitomised
what
the
ancient
egyptians
thought
about
the
eternal
element
in
man
and
its
connection
with
the
divine
the
proof
of
this
may
be
found
in
the
of
the
which
has
been
deciphered
by
the
diligence
of
investigators
lepsius
totenbuch
der
alten
berlin
it
is
the
greatest
continuous
literary
work
which
has
come
down
to
us
from
ancient
egypt
all
kinds
of
instructions
and
prayers
are
contained
in
it
which
were
put
into
the
tomb
of
each
deceased
person
to
serve
as
a
guide
when
he
was
released
from
his
mortal
tenement
the
most
intimate
ideas
of
the
egyptians
about
the
eternal
and
the
origin
of
the
world
are
contained
in
this
work
these
ideas
point
to
a
conception
of
the
gods
similar
to
that
of
greek
mysticism
osiris
gradually
became
the
favourite
and
most
universally
recognised
of
the
various
deities
worshipped
in
different
parts
of
egypt
in
him
were
comprised
the
ideas
about
the
other
divinities
whatever
the
majority
of
the
egyptian
people
may
have
thought
about
osiris
the
of
the
indicates
that
the
priestly
wisdom
saw
in
him
a
being
that
might
be
found
in
the
human
soul
itself
everything
said
about
death
and
the
dead
shows
this
plainly
while
the
body
is
given
to
earth
and
kept
by
it
the
eternal
part
of
man
enters
upon
the
path
to
the
primordial
eternal
it
comes
before
the
tribunal
of
osiris
and
the
judges
of
the
dead
the
fate
of
the
eternal
part
of
man
depends
on
the
verdict
of
these
judges
if
the
soul
has
confessed
its
sins
and
been
deemed
reconciled
to
eternal
justice
invisible
powers
approach
it
and
say
the
osiris
has
been
purified
in
the
pool
which
is
south
of
the
field
of
hotep
and
north
of
the
field
of
locusts
where
the
gods
of
verdure
purify
themselves
at
the
fourth
hour
of
the
night
and
the
eighth
hour
of
the
day
with
the
image
of
the
heart
of
the
gods
passing
from
night
to
day
thus
within
the
eternal
cosmic
order
the
eternal
part
of
man
is
addressed
as
an
osiris
after
the
name
osiris
comes
the
deceased
person
own
name
and
the
one
who
is
being
united
with
the
eternal
cosmic
order
also
calls
himself
osiris
i
am
the
osiris
growing
under
the
blossoms
of
the
is
the
name
of
the
osiris
man
therefore
becomes
an
osiris
being
osiris
is
only
a
perfect
stage
in
human
development
it
seems
obvious
that
even
the
osiris
who
is
a
judge
within
the
eternal
cosmic
order
is
nothing
else
but
a
perfect
man
between
being
human
and
divine
there
is
a
difference
in
degree
and
number
the
mystic
view
of
the
mystery
of
number
underlies
this
osiris
as
a
cosmic
being
is
one
yet
on
this
account
he
exists
undivided
in
each
human
soul
each
person
is
an
osiris
yet
the
one
osiris
must
be
represented
as
a
separate
being
man
is
in
course
of
development
at
the
end
of
his
evolutionary
career
he
becomes
divine
in
taking
this
view
we
must
speak
of
divinity
or
becoming
divine
rather
than
of
a
separate
divine
being
complete
in
himself
it
can
not
be
doubted
but
that
according
to
this
view
only
he
can
really
enter
upon
the
osiris
existence
who
has
reached
the
portals
of
the
eternal
cosmic
order
as
an
osiris
thus
the
highest
life
which
man
can
lead
must
consist
in
his
changing
himself
into
osiris
even
during
mortal
life
a
true
man
will
live
as
a
perfect
osiris
as
far
as
he
can
he
becomes
perfect
when
he
lives
as
an
osiris
when
he
passes
through
the
experiences
of
osiris
in
this
way
we
see
the
deeper
significance
of
the
osiris
myth
it
becomes
the
ideal
of
the
man
who
wishes
to
awaken
the
eternal
within
him
osiris
is
torn
to
pieces
and
killed
by
typhon
the
fragments
of
his
body
are
preserved
and
cared
for
by
his
consort
isis
after
his
death
he
let
a
ray
of
his
own
light
fall
upon
her
and
she
bore
him
horus
this
horus
takes
up
the
earthly
tasks
of
osiris
he
is
the
second
osiris
still
imperfect
but
progressing
towards
the
true
osiris
the
true
osiris
is
in
the
human
soul
which
at
first
is
of
a
transitory
nature
but
as
such
it
is
destined
to
give
birth
to
the
eternal
man
may
therefore
regard
himself
as
the
tomb
of
osiris
the
lower
nature
typhon
has
killed
the
higher
nature
in
him
love
in
his
soul
isis
must
take
care
of
the
dead
fragments
of
his
body
and
then
the
higher
nature
the
eternal
soul
horus
will
be
born
which
can
progress
to
osiris
life
the
man
who
is
aspiring
to
the
highest
kind
of
existence
must
repeat
in
himself
as
a
microcosm
the
macrocosmic
universal
osiris
process
this
is
the
meaning
of
egyptian
initiation
what
plato
describes
as
a
cosmic
process
that
the
creator
has
stretched
the
soul
of
the
world
on
the
body
of
the
world
in
the
form
of
a
cross
and
that
the
cosmic
process
is
the
release
of
this
crucified
soul
this
process
had
to
be
enacted
in
man
on
a
smaller
scale
if
he
was
to
be
qualified
for
osiris
life
the
candidate
for
initiation
had
to
develop
himself
in
such
a
way
that
his
his
becoming
an
osiris
became
blended
into
one
with
the
cosmic
osiris
process
if
we
could
look
into
the
temples
of
initiation
in
which
people
underwent
the
transformation
into
osiris
we
should
see
that
what
took
place
represented
microcosmically
the
building
of
the
cosmos
man
who
proceeded
from
the
father
was
to
give
birth
to
the
son
in
himself
what
he
actually
bears
within
him
divinity
hidden
under
a
spell
was
to
become
manifest
in
him
this
divinity
is
kept
down
in
him
by
the
power
of
the
earthly
nature
this
lower
nature
must
first
be
buried
in
order
that
the
higher
nature
may
arise
from
this
we
are
able
to
interpret
what
we
are
told
about
the
incidents
of
initiation
the
candidate
was
subjected
to
mysterious
processes
by
means
of
which
his
earthly
nature
was
killed
and
his
higher
part
awakened
it
is
not
necessary
to
study
these
processes
in
detail
if
we
understand
their
meaning
this
meaning
is
contained
in
the
confession
possible
to
every
one
who
went
through
initiation
he
could
say
before
me
was
the
endless
perspective
at
the
end
of
which
is
the
perfection
of
the
divine
i
felt
that
the
power
of
the
divine
is
within
me
i
buried
what
in
me
keeps
down
that
power
i
died
to
earthly
things
i
was
dead
i
had
died
as
a
lower
man
i
was
in
the
i
had
intercourse
with
the
dead
with
those
who
have
already
become
part
of
the
chain
of
the
eternal
cosmic
order
after
my
sojourn
in
the
i
arose
from
the
dead
i
overcame
death
but
now
i
have
become
different
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
perishable
nature
it
has
in
me
become
saturated
with
the
logos
i
now
belong
to
those
who
live
eternally
and
who
will
sit
at
the
right
hand
of
osiris
i
myself
shall
be
a
true
osiris
part
of
the
eternal
cosmic
order
and
judgment
of
life
and
death
will
be
placed
in
my
hands
the
candidate
for
initiation
had
to
submit
to
the
experience
which
made
such
a
confession
possible
to
him
thus
this
was
an
experience
of
the
highest
kind
let
us
now
imagine
that
a
hears
of
such
experiences
he
can
not
know
what
has
really
taken
place
in
the
initiate
soul
in
his
eyes
the
initiate
died
physically
lay
in
the
grave
and
rose
again
what
is
a
spiritual
reality
at
a
higher
stage
of
existence
appears
when
expressed
in
the
form
of
as
an
event
which
breaks
through
the
order
of
nature
it
is
a
miracle
so
far
initiation
was
a
miracle
one
who
really
wished
to
understand
it
must
have
awakened
within
him
powers
to
enable
him
to
stand
on
a
higher
plane
of
existence
he
must
have
approached
these
higher
experiences
through
a
course
of
life
specially
adapted
for
the
purpose
in
whatever
way
these
prepared
experiences
were
enacted
in
individual
cases
they
are
always
found
to
be
of
quite
a
definite
type
and
so
an
initiate
life
is
a
typical
one
it
may
be
described
independently
of
the
single
personality
or
rather
an
individual
could
only
be
described
as
being
on
the
way
to
the
divine
if
he
had
passed
through
these
definite
typical
experiences
such
a
personality
was
buddha
living
in
the
midst
of
his
disciples
as
such
an
one
did
jesus
appear
to
his
community
nowadays
we
know
of
the
parallelism
that
exists
between
the
biographies
of
buddha
and
of
jesus
rudolf
seydel
has
convincingly
proved
this
parallelism
in
his
book
und
compare
also
the
excellent
essay
by
jesus
ein
buddhist
we
have
only
to
follow
out
the
two
lives
in
detail
in
order
to
see
that
all
objections
to
the
parallelism
are
futile
the
birth
of
buddha
is
announced
by
a
white
elephant
which
descends
from
heaven
and
declares
to
the
queen
maya
that
she
will
bring
forth
a
divine
man
who
will
attune
all
beings
to
love
and
friendship
and
will
unite
them
in
a
close
alliance
we
read
in
luke
gospel
to
a
virgin
espoused
to
a
man
whose
name
was
joseph
of
the
house
of
david
and
the
virgin
name
was
mary
and
the
angel
came
in
unto
her
and
said
thou
that
art
highly
favoured
behold
thou
shalt
conceive
in
thy
womb
and
bring
forth
a
son
and
shalt
call
his
name
jesus
he
shall
be
great
and
shall
be
called
the
son
of
the
highest
the
brahmins
or
indian
priests
who
know
what
the
birth
of
a
buddha
means
interpret
maya
dream
they
have
a
definite
typical
idea
of
a
buddha
to
which
the
life
of
the
personality
about
to
be
born
will
have
to
correspond
similarly
we
read
in
matthew
ii
that
when
herod
had
gathered
all
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
of
the
people
together
he
demanded
of
them
where
christ
should
be
born
the
brahmin
asita
says
of
buddha
this
is
the
child
which
will
become
buddha
the
redeemer
the
leader
to
immortality
freedom
and
light
compare
with
this
luke
ii
and
behold
there
was
a
man
in
jerusalem
whose
name
was
simeon
and
the
same
man
was
just
and
devout
waiting
for
the
consolation
of
israel
and
the
holy
ghost
was
upon
him
and
when
the
parents
brought
in
the
child
jesus
to
do
for
him
after
the
custom
of
the
law
then
took
he
him
up
in
his
arms
and
blessed
god
and
said
lord
now
lettest
thou
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
according
to
thy
word
for
mine
eyes
have
seen
thy
salvation
which
thou
hast
prepared
before
the
face
of
all
people
a
light
to
lighten
the
gentiles
and
the
glory
of
thy
people
israel
it
is
related
of
buddha
that
at
the
age
of
twelve
he
was
lost
and
found
again
under
a
tree
surrounded
by
poets
and
sages
of
the
olden
time
whom
he
was
teaching
with
this
incident
the
following
passage
in
luke
corresponds
now
his
parents
went
to
jerusalem
every
year
at
the
feast
of
the
passover
and
when
he
was
twelve
years
old
they
went
up
to
jerusalem
after
the
custom
of
the
feast
and
when
they
had
fulfilled
the
days
as
they
returned
the
child
jesus
tarried
behind
in
jerusalem
and
joseph
and
his
mother
knew
not
of
it
but
they
supposing
him
to
have
been
in
the
company
went
a
day
journey
and
they
sought
him
among
their
kinsfolk
and
acquaintance
and
when
they
found
him
not
they
turned
back
again
to
jerusalem
seeking
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
three
days
they
found
him
in
the
temple
sitting
in
the
midst
of
the
doctors
both
hearing
them
and
asking
them
questions
and
all
that
heard
him
were
astonished
at
his
understanding
and
answers
luke
ii
after
buddha
had
lived
in
solitude
and
returned
he
was
received
by
the
benediction
of
a
virgin
blessed
is
thy
mother
blessed
is
thy
father
blessed
is
the
wife
to
whom
thou
belongest
but
he
replied
only
they
are
blessed
who
are
in
nirvana
who
have
entered
the
eternal
cosmic
order
in
luke
gospel
xi
we
read
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
spake
these
things
a
certain
woman
of
the
company
lifted
up
her
voice
and
said
unto
him
is
the
womb
that
bare
thee
and
the
paps
which
thou
hast
sucked
but
he
said
rather
blessed
are
they
that
hear
the
word
of
god
and
keep
it
in
the
course
of
buddha
life
the
tempter
comes
to
him
and
promises
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
buddha
refuses
everything
in
the
words
i
know
well
that
i
am
destined
to
have
a
kingdom
but
i
do
not
desire
an
earthly
one
i
shall
become
buddha
and
make
all
the
world
exult
with
joy
the
tempter
has
to
own
that
his
reign
is
over
jesus
answers
the
same
temptation
in
the
words
get
thee
hence
satan
for
it
is
written
thou
shalt
worship
the
lord
thy
god
and
him
only
shalt
thou
serve
then
the
devil
leaveth
him
matthew
iv
this
description
of
the
parallelism
might
be
extended
to
many
other
points
with
the
same
result
the
life
of
buddha
ended
sublimely
on
a
journey
he
felt
ill
he
came
to
the
river
hiranja
near
kuschinagara
there
he
lay
down
on
a
carpet
which
his
favourite
disciple
ananda
spread
for
him
his
body
began
to
be
luminous
from
within
he
died
transfigured
his
body
irradiating
light
saying
nothing
endures
the
death
of
buddha
corresponds
with
the
transfiguration
of
jesus
and
it
came
to
pass
about
eight
days
after
these
sayings
he
took
peter
and
john
and
james
and
went
up
into
a
mountain
to
pray
and
as
he
prayed
the
fashion
of
his
countenance
was
altered
and
his
raiment
was
white
and
glistering
buddha
earthly
life
ends
at
this
point
but
it
is
here
that
the
most
important
part
of
the
life
of
jesus
begins
his
suffering
death
and
resurrection
other
accounts
of
buddha
death
need
not
here
be
considered
even
though
they
reveal
profound
aspects
the
agreement
in
these
two
redemptive
lives
leads
to
the
same
conclusion
the
narratives
themselves
indicate
the
nature
of
this
conclusion
when
the
hear
what
kind
of
birth
is
to
take
place
they
know
what
is
involved
they
know
that
they
have
to
do
with
a
divine
man
they
know
beforehand
what
kind
of
personality
it
is
who
is
appearing
and
therefore
his
course
of
life
can
only
correspond
with
what
they
know
about
the
life
of
a
divine
man
in
the
wisdom
of
their
mysteries
such
a
life
is
traced
out
for
all
eternity
it
only
be
as
it
be
it
comes
into
manifestation
like
an
eternal
law
of
nature
just
as
a
chemical
substance
can
only
behave
in
a
certain
definite
way
so
a
buddha
or
a
christ
can
only
live
in
a
certain
definite
way
his
life
is
not
described
merely
by
writing
a
casual
biography
it
is
much
better
described
by
giving
the
typical
features
which
are
contained
for
all
time
in
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
the
buddha
legend
is
no
more
a
biography
in
the
ordinary
sense
than
the
gospels
are
meant
to
be
a
biography
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
christ
jesus
in
neither
is
the
merely
accidental
given
both
relate
the
course
of
life
marked
out
for
a
the
source
of
the
two
accounts
is
to
be
found
in
the
mystery
traditions
and
not
in
outer
physical
history
jesus
and
buddha
are
to
those
who
have
recognised
their
divine
nature
initiates
in
the
most
eminent
sense
hence
their
lives
are
lifted
out
of
things
transitory
and
what
is
known
about
initiates
applies
to
them
the
casual
incidents
in
their
lives
are
not
narrated
of
such
it
might
be
announced
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
and
the
word
was
a
god
and
the
word
was
made
flesh
and
dwelt
among
us
but
the
life
of
jesus
contains
more
than
that
of
buddha
buddha
ends
with
the
transfiguration
the
most
momentous
part
of
the
life
of
jesus
begins
after
the
transfiguration
in
the
language
of
initiates
this
means
that
buddha
reached
the
point
at
which
divine
light
begins
to
shine
in
men
he
faces
mortal
death
he
becomes
the
light
of
the
world
jesus
goes
farther
he
does
not
physically
die
at
the
moment
when
the
light
of
the
world
shines
through
him
at
that
moment
he
is
a
buddha
but
at
that
very
moment
he
enters
upon
a
stage
which
finds
expression
in
a
higher
degree
of
initiation
he
suffers
and
dies
what
is
earthly
disappears
but
the
spiritual
element
the
light
of
the
world
does
not
his
resurrection
follows
he
is
revealed
to
his
followers
as
christ
buddha
at
the
moment
of
his
transfiguration
flows
into
the
blissful
life
of
the
universal
spirit
christ
jesus
awakens
the
universal
spirit
once
more
but
in
a
human
form
in
present
existence
such
an
event
had
formerly
taken
place
at
the
higher
stages
of
initiation
those
initiated
in
the
spirit
of
the
osiris
myth
attained
to
such
a
resurrection
in
the
life
of
jesus
this
great
initiation
was
added
to
the
buddha
initiation
buddha
demonstrated
by
his
life
that
man
is
the
logos
and
that
he
returns
to
the
logos
to
the
light
when
his
earthly
part
dies
in
jesus
the
logos
himself
became
a
person
in
him
the
word
was
made
flesh
therefore
what
was
enacted
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
the
temples
by
the
guardians
of
the
ancient
mysteries
has
been
apprehended
through
christianity
as
a
historical
fact
the
followers
of
christ
jesus
confessed
their
belief
in
him
the
initiate
of
unique
and
supreme
greatness
he
proved
to
them
that
the
world
is
divine
in
the
christian
community
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
was
indissolubly
bound
up
with
the
personality
of
christ
jesus
that
which
man
previously
had
sought
to
attain
through
the
mysteries
was
now
replaced
by
the
belief
that
christ
had
lived
on
earth
and
that
the
faithful
belonged
to
him
henceforward
part
of
what
was
formerly
only
to
be
gained
through
mystical
methods
could
be
replaced
in
the
christian
community
by
the
conviction
that
the
divine
had
been
manifested
in
the
word
present
amongst
them
not
that
for
which
each
individual
soul
underwent
a
long
preparation
was
now
decisive
but
what
those
had
heard
and
seen
who
were
with
jesus
and
what
was
handed
down
by
them
that
which
was
from
the
beginning
which
we
have
heard
which
our
hands
have
handled
of
the
word
of
life
that
which
we
have
seen
and
heard
declare
we
unto
you
that
ye
also
may
have
fellowship
with
us
thus
do
we
read
in
the
first
epistle
of
john
and
this
immediate
reality
is
to
embrace
all
future
generations
in
a
living
bond
of
union
and
as
a
church
is
mystically
to
extend
from
race
to
race
it
is
in
this
sense
that
the
words
of
augustine
are
to
be
understood
i
should
not
believe
the
gospels
unless
the
authority
of
the
catholic
church
induced
me
to
do
so
thus
the
gospels
do
not
contain
within
themselves
testimony
to
their
truth
but
they
are
to
be
believed
because
they
are
founded
on
the
personality
of
jesus
and
because
the
church
from
that
personality
mysteriously
draws
the
power
to
make
the
truth
of
the
gospels
manifest
the
mysteries
handed
down
traditionally
the
means
of
arriving
at
truth
the
christian
community
itself
propagates
the
truth
to
the
confidence
in
the
mystical
forces
which
spring
up
in
the
inmost
being
of
man
during
initiation
was
added
the
confidence
in
the
one
primordial
initiator
the
mystics
sought
to
become
divine
they
wished
to
experience
divinity
jesus
was
divine
we
must
hold
fast
to
him
and
then
we
shall
become
partakers
of
his
divinity
in
the
community
founded
by
him
this
became
christian
conviction
what
became
divine
in
jesus
was
made
so
for
all
his
followers
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
the
one
who
was
born
in
bethlehem
has
an
eternal
character
independent
of
time
the
christmas
anthem
thus
speaks
of
the
birth
of
jesus
as
if
it
took
place
each
christmas
christ
is
born
the
saviour
has
come
into
the
world
the
angels
are
singing
on
earth
in
the
is
to
be
seen
a
definite
stage
of
initiation
when
the
mystic
of
times
passed
through
this
he
was
through
his
initiation
in
a
state
which
enabled
him
to
perceive
something
spiritually
in
higher
worlds
to
which
no
fact
in
the
world
of
sense
corresponded
he
experienced
that
which
surrounds
the
mystery
of
golgotha
in
the
higher
world
if
the
christian
mystic
goes
through
this
experience
by
initiation
he
at
the
same
time
beholds
the
historical
event
which
took
place
on
golgotha
and
knows
that
in
that
event
enacted
within
the
physical
world
there
is
the
same
content
as
was
formerly
only
in
the
supersensible
facts
of
the
mysteries
thus
there
was
poured
out
on
the
christian
community
through
the
mysteries
of
golgotha
that
which
formerly
had
been
poured
out
on
the
mystics
within
the
temples
and
initiation
gives
christian
mystics
the
possibility
of
becoming
conscious
of
what
is
contained
in
the
mystery
of
golgotha
whereas
faith
makes
man
an
unconscious
partaker
of
the
mystical
stream
which
flowed
from
the
events
depicted
in
the
new
testament
and
which
has
ever
since
been
pervading
the
spiritual
life
of
humanity
footnotes
the
great
initiates
raised
themselves
through
initiation
up
into
the
sphere
of
the
logos
and
carried
this
logos
influence
with
them
in
their
human
life
the
fundamental
difference
between
them
and
jesus
was
the
fact
that
the
logos
in
the
course
of
its
evolution
individualised
itself
into
one
divine
individuality
who
descended
into
jesus
of
nazareth
at
the
baptism
and
so
that
the
logos
manifested
its
whole
divine
individuality
through
the
personality
of
jesus
as
far
as
it
was
possible
to
express
divinity
by
human
means
such
was
the
unique
character
of
the
christ
jesus
vii
the
gospels
the
accounts
of
the
life
of
jesus
which
can
be
submitted
to
historical
examination
are
contained
in
the
gospels
all
that
does
not
come
from
this
source
might
in
the
opinion
of
one
of
those
who
are
considered
the
greatest
historical
authorities
on
the
subject
harnack
be
easily
written
on
a
quarto
page
but
what
kind
of
documents
are
these
gospels
the
fourth
that
of
john
differs
so
much
from
the
others
that
those
who
think
themselves
obliged
to
follow
the
path
of
historical
research
in
order
to
study
the
subject
come
to
the
conclusion
if
john
possesses
the
genuine
tradition
about
the
life
of
jesus
that
of
the
first
three
evangelists
the
synoptists
is
untenable
if
the
synoptists
are
right
the
fourth
gospel
must
be
rejected
as
a
historical
source

this
is
a
statement
made
from
the
standpoint
of
the
historical
investigator
in
the
present
work
in
which
we
are
dealing
with
the
mystical
contents
of
the
gospels
such
a
point
of
view
is
neither
to
be
accepted
nor
rejected
but
attention
must
certainly
be
drawn
to
such
an
opinion
as
the
following
measured
by
the
standard
of
consistency
inspiration
and
completeness
these
writings
leave
very
much
to
be
desired
and
even
measured
by
the
ordinary
human
standard
they
suffer
from
not
a
few
imperfections
this
is
the
opinion
of
a
christian
theologian
harnack
des
one
who
takes
his
stand
on
a
mystical
origin
of
the
gospels
easily
finds
an
explanation
of
what
is
apparently
contradictory
and
also
discovers
harmony
between
the
fourth
gospel
and
the
three
others
for
none
of
these
writings
are
meant
to
be
mere
historical
tradition
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
they
do
not
profess
to
give
a
historical
biography
what
they
intended
to
give
was
already
shadowed
forth
in
the
traditions
of
the
mysteries
as
the
typical
life
of
a
son
of
god
it
was
these
traditions
which
were
drawn
upon
not
history
now
it
was
only
natural
that
these
traditions
should
not
be
in
complete
verbal
agreement
in
every
mystery
centre
still
the
agreement
was
so
close
that
the
buddhists
narrated
the
life
of
their
divine
man
almost
in
the
same
way
in
which
the
evangelists
narrated
the
life
of
christ
but
naturally
there
were
differences
we
have
only
to
assume
that
the
four
evangelists
drew
from
four
different
mystery
traditions
it
testifies
to
the
extraordinary
personality
of
jesus
that
in
four
writers
belonging
to
different
traditions
he
awakened
the
belief
that
he
was
one
who
so
perfectly
corresponded
with
their
type
of
an
initiate
that
they
were
able
to
describe
him
as
one
who
lived
the
typical
life
marked
out
in
their
mysteries
they
each
described
his
life
according
to
their
own
mystic
traditions
and
if
the
narratives
of
the
first
three
evangelists
resemble
each
other
it
proves
nothing
more
than
that
they
drew
from
similar
mystery
traditions
the
fourth
evangelist
saturated
his
gospel
with
ideas
which
are
in
many
respects
reminiscent
of
the
religious
philosopher
philo
this
only
proves
that
he
was
rooted
in
the
same
mystic
tradition
as
philo
there
are
various
elements
in
the
gospels
firstly
facts
are
related
which
seem
to
lay
claim
to
being
historical
secondly
there
are
parables
in
which
the
narrative
form
is
only
used
to
symbolise
a
deeper
truth
and
thirdly
there
are
teachings
characteristic
of
the
christian
conception
of
life
in
john
gospel
there
is
no
real
parable
the
source
from
which
he
drew
was
a
mystical
school
which
considered
parables
unnecessary
the
part
played
by
ostensibly
historical
facts
and
parables
in
the
first
three
gospels
is
clearly
shown
in
the
narrative
of
the
cursing
of
the
fig
tree
in
mark
xi
we
read
and
jesus
entered
into
jerusalem
and
into
the
temple
and
when
he
had
looked
round
about
upon
all
things
and
now
the
eventide
was
come
he
went
out
unto
bethany
with
the
twelve
and
on
the
morrow
when
they
were
come
from
bethany
he
was
hungry
and
seeing
a
fig
tree
afar
off
having
leaves
he
came
if
haply
he
might
find
any
thing
thereon
and
when
he
came
to
it
he
found
nothing
but
leaves
for
the
time
of
figs
was
not
yet
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
it
no
man
eat
fruit
of
thee
hereafter
for
ever
in
the
corresponding
passage
in
luke
gospel
he
relates
a
parable
xiii
he
spake
also
this
parable
a
certain
man
had
a
fig
tree
planted
in
his
vineyard
and
he
came
and
sought
fruit
thereon
and
found
none
then
said
he
unto
the
dresser
of
his
vineyard
behold
these
three
years
i
come
seeking
fruit
on
this
fig
tree
and
find
none
cut
it
down
why
cumbereth
it
the
ground
this
is
a
parable
symbolising
the
uselessness
of
the
old
teaching
represented
by
the
barren
fig
tree
that
which
is
meant
metaphorically
mark
relates
as
a
fact
appearing
to
be
historical
we
may
therefore
assume
that
in
general
facts
related
in
the
gospels
are
not
to
be
taken
as
only
historical
or
as
if
they
were
only
to
hold
good
in
the
physical
world
but
as
mystical
facts
as
experiences
for
the
recognition
of
which
spiritual
vision
is
necessary
and
which
arise
from
various
mystical
traditions
if
we
admit
this
the
difference
between
the
gospel
of
john
and
the
synoptists
ceases
to
exist
for
mystical
interpretation
historical
research
has
not
to
be
taken
into
account
even
if
one
or
another
gospel
were
written
a
few
decades
earlier
or
later
than
the
others
they
are
all
of
like
historical
value
to
the
mystic
john
gospel
as
well
as
the
others
and
the
miracles
do
not
present
the
least
difficulty
when
interpreted
mystically
they
are
supposed
to
break
through
the
laws
of
nature
they
only
do
this
when
they
are
considered
as
events
which
have
so
come
about
on
the
physical
plane
in
the
perishable
world
that
ordinary
could
see
through
them
offhand
but
if
they
are
experiences
which
can
only
be
fathomed
on
a
higher
stage
of
existence
namely
the
spiritual
it
is
obvious
that
they
can
not
be
understood
by
means
of
the
laws
of
physical
nature
it
is
thus
first
of
all
necessary
to
read
the
gospels
correctly
then
we
shall
know
in
what
way
they
are
speaking
of
the
founder
of
christianity
their
intention
is
to
relate
his
life
in
the
manner
in
which
communications
were
made
through
the
mysteries
they
relate
it
in
the
way
in
which
a
mystic
would
speak
of
an
initiate
only
they
give
the
initiation
as
the
unique
characteristic
of
one
unique
being
and
they
make
salvation
depend
on
man
holding
fast
to
the
initiate
of
this
unique
order
what
had
come
to
the
initiates
was
the
kingdom
of
god
this
unique
being
has
brought
the
kingdom
to
all
who
will
cleave
to
him
what
was
formerly
the
personal
concern
of
each
individual
has
become
the
common
concern
of
all
those
who
are
willing
to
acknowledge
jesus
as
their
lord
we
can
understand
how
this
came
about
if
we
admit
that
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
was
imbedded
in
the
popular
religion
of
the
jews
christianity
arose
out
of
judaism
we
need
not
therefore
be
surprised
at
finding
engrafted
on
judaism
together
with
christianity
those
mystical
ideas
which
we
have
seen
to
be
the
common
property
of
greek
and
egyptian
spiritual
life
if
we
examine
national
religions
we
find
various
conceptions
of
the
spiritual
but
if
in
each
case
we
go
back
to
the
deeper
wisdom
of
the
priests
which
proves
to
be
the
spiritual
nucleus
of
them
all
we
find
agreement
everywhere
plato
knows
himself
to
be
in
agreement
with
the
of
egypt
when
he
is
trying
to
set
forth
the
main
content
of
greek
wisdom
in
his
philosophical
view
of
the
universe
it
is
related
of
pythagoras
that
he
travelled
to
egypt
and
india
and
was
instructed
by
the
sages
in
those
countries
thinkers
who
lived
in
the
earlier
days
of
christianity
found
so
much
agreement
between
the
philosophical
teachings
of
plato
and
the
deeper
meaning
of
the
mosaic
writings
that
they
called
plato
a
moses
with
attic
tongue
thus
mystery
wisdom
existed
everywhere
in
judaism
it
acquired
a
form
which
it
had
to
assume
if
it
was
to
become
a
judaism
expected
the
messiah
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
when
the
personality
of
an
unique
initiate
appeared
the
jews
could
only
conceive
of
him
as
being
the
messiah
indeed
this
circumstance
throws
light
on
the
fact
that
what
had
been
an
individual
matter
in
the
mysteries
became
an
affair
of
the
whole
nation
the
jewish
religion
had
from
the
beginning
been
a
national
religion
the
jewish
people
looked
upon
itself
as
one
organism
its
jao
was
the
god
of
the
whole
nation
if
the
son
of
this
god
were
to
be
born
he
must
be
the
redeemer
of
the
whole
nation
the
individual
mystic
was
not
to
be
saved
apart
from
others
the
whole
nation
was
to
share
in
the
redemption
that
one
is
to
die
for
all
is
founded
on
the
fundamental
ideas
of
the
jewish
religion
it
is
also
certain
that
there
were
mysteries
in
judaism
which
could
be
brought
out
of
the
dimness
of
a
secret
cult
into
the
popular
religion
a
mysticism
existed
side
by
side
with
the
priestly
wisdom
which
was
attached
to
the
outer
formalism
of
the
pharisees
this
mystery
wisdom
is
spoken
of
among
the
jews
just
as
it
is
elsewhere
when
one
day
an
initiate
was
speaking
of
it
and
his
hearers
sensed
the
secret
meaning
of
his
words
they
said
old
man
what
hast
thou
done
oh
that
thou
hadst
kept
silence
thou
thinkest
to
navigate
the
boundless
ocean
without
sail
or
mast
this
is
what
thou
art
attempting
wilt
thou
fly
upwards
thou
canst
not
wilt
thou
descend
into
the
depths
an
immeasurable
abyss
is
yawning
before
thee
and
the
kabbalists
from
whom
the
above
is
taken
also
speak
of
four
rabbis
and
these
four
rabbis
sought
the
secret
path
to
the
divine
the
first
died
the
second
lost
his
reason
the
third
caused
monstrous
evils
and
only
the
fourth
rabbi
akiba
went
in
and
out
of
the
spiritual
world
in
peace
we
thus
see
that
within
judaism
also
there
was
a
soil
in
which
an
initiate
of
an
unique
kind
could
develop
he
had
only
to
say
to
himself
i
will
not
let
salvation
be
limited
to
a
few
chosen
people
i
will
let
all
people
participate
in
it
he
was
to
carry
out
into
the
world
at
large
what
the
elect
had
experienced
in
the
temples
of
the
mysteries
he
had
to
be
willing
to
take
upon
himself
to
be
in
spirit
to
his
community
through
his
personality
that
which
the
cult
of
the
mysteries
had
heretofore
been
to
those
who
took
part
in
them
it
is
true
he
could
not
at
once
give
to
the
whole
community
the
experiences
of
the
mysteries
nor
would
he
have
wished
to
do
so
but
he
wished
to
give
to
all
the
certainty
of
the
truth
contemplated
in
the
mysteries
he
wished
to
cause
the
life
which
flowed
within
the
mysteries
to
flow
through
the
further
historical
evolution
of
humanity
and
thus
to
raise
mankind
to
a
higher
stage
of
existence
blessed
are
they
that
have
not
seen
and
yet
have
believed
he
wished
to
plant
unshakably
in
human
hearts
in
the
form
of
confidence
the
certainty
that
the
divine
really
exists
one
who
stands
outside
initiation
and
has
this
confidence
will
certainly
go
further
than
one
who
is
without
it
it
must
have
weighed
like
a
mountain
on
the
mind
of
jesus
to
think
that
there
might
be
many
standing
outside
who
do
not
find
the
way
he
wished
to
lessen
the
gulf
between
those
to
be
initiated
and
the
people
christianity
was
to
be
a
means
by
which
every
one
might
find
the
way
should
one
or
another
not
yet
be
ripe
at
any
rate
he
is
not
cut
off
from
the
possibility
of
sharing
more
or
less
unconsciously
in
the
benefit
of
the
spiritual
current
flowing
through
the
mysteries
the
son
of
man
is
come
to
seek
and
to
save
that
which
was
lost
henceforward
even
those
who
can
not
yet
share
in
initiation
may
enjoy
some
of
the
fruits
of
the
mysteries
henceforth
the
kingdom
of
god
was
not
to
be
dependent
on
outward
ceremonies
neither
shall
they
say
lo
here
or
lo
there
for
behold
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
you
with
jesus
the
point
in
question
was
not
so
much
how
far
this
or
that
person
advanced
in
the
kingdom
of
the
spirit
as
that
all
should
be
convinced
that
that
kingdom
exists
in
this
rejoice
not
that
the
spirits
are
subject
unto
you
but
rather
rejoice
because
your
names
are
written
in
heaven
that
is
have
confidence
in
the
divine
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
find
it
viii
the
lazarus
miracle
amongst
the
miracles
attributed
to
jesus
very
special
importance
must
be
attached
to
the
raising
of
lazarus
at
bethany
everything
combines
to
assign
a
prominent
position
in
the
new
testament
to
that
which
is
here
related
by
the
evangelist
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
john
alone
relates
it
the
evangelist
who
by
the
weighty
words
with
which
he
opens
his
gospel
claims
for
it
a
very
definite
interpretation
john
begins
with
these
sentences
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
and
the
word
was
a
god
and
the
word
was
made
flesh
and
dwelt
among
us
and
we
beheld
his
glory
a
glory
as
of
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
full
of
grace
and
truth
one
who
places
such
words
at
the
beginning
of
his
narrative
is
plainly
indicating
that
he
wishes
it
to
be
interpreted
in
a
very
deep
sense
the
man
who
approaches
it
with
merely
intellectual
explanations
or
otherwise
in
a
superficial
way
is
like
one
who
thinks
that
othello
on
the
stage
really
murders
desdemona
what
then
is
it
that
john
means
to
say
in
his
introductory
words
he
plainly
says
that
he
is
speaking
of
something
eternal
which
existed
at
the
beginning
of
things
he
relates
facts
but
they
are
not
to
be
taken
as
facts
observed
by
the
eye
and
ear
and
upon
which
logical
reason
exercises
its
skill
he
hides
behind
facts
the
word
which
is
in
the
cosmic
spirit
for
him
the
facts
are
the
medium
in
which
a
higher
meaning
is
expressed
and
we
may
therefore
assume
that
in
the
fact
of
a
man
being
raised
from
the
dead
a
fact
which
offers
the
greatest
difficulties
to
the
eye
ear
and
logical
reason
the
very
deepest
meaning
lies
concealed
another
thing
has
to
be
taken
into
consideration
renan
in
his
of
has
pointed
out
that
the
raising
of
lazarus
undoubtedly
had
a
decisive
influence
on
the
end
of
the
life
of
jesus
such
a
thought
appears
impossible
from
the
point
of
view
which
renan
takes
for
why
should
the
fact
that
the
belief
was
being
circulated
amongst
the
populace
that
jesus
had
raised
a
man
from
the
dead
appear
to
his
opponents
so
dangerous
that
they
asked
the
question
can
jesus
and
judaism
exist
side
by
side
it
does
not
do
to
assert
with
renan
the
other
miracles
of
jesus
were
passing
events
repeated
in
good
faith
and
exaggerated
by
popular
report
and
they
were
thought
no
more
of
after
they
had
happened
but
this
one
was
a
real
event
publicly
known
and
by
means
of
which
it
was
sought
to
silence
the
pharisees
all
the
enemies
of
jesus
were
exasperated
by
the
sensation
it
caused
it
is
related
that
they
sought
to
kill
lazarus
it
is
incomprehensible
why
this
should
be
if
renan
were
right
in
his
opinion
that
all
that
happened
at
bethany
was
the
getting
up
of
a
mock
scene
intended
to
strengthen
belief
in
jesus
perhaps
lazarus
still
pale
from
his
illness
had
himself
wrapped
in
a
shroud
and
laid
in
the
family
grave
these
tombs
were
large
rooms
hewn
out
of
the
rock
and
entered
by
a
square
opening
which
was
closed
by
an
immense
slab
martha
and
mary
hastened
to
meet
jesus
and
brought
him
to
the
grave
before
he
had
entered
bethany
the
painful
emotion
felt
by
jesus
at
the
grave
of
the
friend
whom
he
believed
to
be
dead
john
xi
might
be
taken
by
those
present
for
the
agitation
and
tremors
which
were
wont
to
accompany
miracles
according
to
popular
belief
divine
power
in
a
man
was
like
an
epileptic
and
convulsive
element
continuing
the
above
hypothesis
jesus
wished
to
see
once
more
the
man
he
had
loved
and
the
stone
having
been
rolled
away
lazarus
came
forth
in
his
his
head
bound
with
a
napkin
this
apparition
naturally
was
looked
upon
by
every
one
as
a
resurrection
faith
knows
no
other
law
than
the
interest
of
what
it
holds
to
be
true
does
not
such
an
explanation
appear
absolutely
naïve
when
renan
adds
the
following
opinion
everything
seems
to
suggest
that
the
miracle
of
bethany
materially
contributed
to
hasten
the
death
of
jesus
yet
there
is
undoubtedly
an
accurate
perception
underlying
this
last
assertion
of
renan
but
with
the
means
at
his
disposal
he
is
not
able
to
interpret
or
justify
his
opinion
something
of
quite
special
importance
must
have
been
accomplished
by
jesus
at
bethany
in
order
that
such
words
as
the
following
may
be
accounted
for
then
gathered
the
chief
priests
and
the
pharisees
a
council
and
said
do
we
for
this
man
doeth
many
miracles
john
xi
renan
too
conjectures
something
special
it
must
be
acknowledged
he
says
that
john
narrative
is
of
an
essentially
different
kind
from
the
accounts
of
miracles
of
which
the
synoptists
are
full
and
which
are
the
outcome
of
the
popular
imagination
let
us
add
that
john
is
the
only
evangelist
with
accurate
knowledge
of
the
relations
of
jesus
with
the
family
at
bethany
and
that
it
would
be
incomprehensible
how
a
creation
of
the
popular
mind
could
have
been
inserted
in
the
frame
of
such
personal
reminiscences
it
is
therefore
probable
that
the
miracle
in
question
was
not
amongst
the
wholly
legendary
ones
for
which
no
one
is
responsible
in
other
words
i
think
that
something
took
place
at
bethany
which
was
looked
upon
as
a
resurrection
does
not
this
really
mean
that
renan
surmises
that
something
happened
at
bethany
which
he
can
not
explain
he
entrenches
himself
behind
the
words
at
this
distance
of
time
and
with
only
one
text
bearing
obvious
traces
of
subsequent
additions
it
is
impossible
to
decide
whether
in
the
present
case
all
is
fiction
or
whether
a
real
fact
which
happened
at
bethany
served
as
the
basis
of
the
report
that
was
spread
abroad
might
it
not
be
that
we
have
to
do
here
with
something
of
which
we
might
arrive
at
a
true
understanding
merely
by
reading
the
text
in
the
right
way
in
that
case
we
should
perhaps
no
longer
speak
of
fiction
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
whole
narrative
of
this
event
in
john
gospel
is
wrapped
in
a
mysterious
veil
to
show
this
we
need
only
mention
one
point
if
the
narrative
is
to
be
taken
in
the
literal
physical
sense
what
meaning
have
these
words
of
jesus
this
sickness
is
not
unto
death
but
for
the
glory
of
god
that
the
son
of
god
might
be
glorified
thereby
this
is
the
usual
translation
of
the
words
but
the
actual
state
of
the
case
is
better
arrived
at
if
they
are
translated
for
the
vision
or
manifestation
of
god
that
the
son
of
god
might
be
manifested
thereby
this
translation
is
also
correct
according
to
the
greek
original
and
what
do
these
other
words
mean
jesus
said
unto
her
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
john
xi
it
would
be
a
triviality
to
think
that
jesus
meant
to
say
that
lazarus
had
only
become
ill
in
order
that
jesus
might
manifest
his
skill
through
him
and
it
would
again
be
a
triviality
to
think
that
jesus
meant
to
assert
that
faith
in
him
brings
to
life
again
one
who
in
the
ordinary
sense
is
dead
what
would
there
be
remarkable
about
a
person
who
has
risen
from
the
dead
if
after
his
resurrection
he
were
the
same
as
he
was
before
dying
indeed
what
would
be
the
meaning
of
describing
the
life
of
such
a
person
in
the
words
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
life
and
meaning
at
once
come
into
the
words
of
jesus
if
we
understand
them
to
be
the
expression
of
a
spiritual
occurrence
and
then
in
a
certain
sense
literally
as
they
stand
in
the
text
jesus
actually
says
that
he
is
the
resurrection
that
has
happened
to
lazarus
and
that
he
is
the
life
that
lazarus
is
living
let
us
take
literally
what
jesus
is
in
john
gospel
he
is
the
word
that
was
made
flesh
he
is
the
eternal
that
existed
in
the
beginning
if
he
is
really
the
resurrection
then
the
eternal
primordial
has
risen
again
in
lazarus
we
have
therefore
to
do
with
a
resurrection
of
the
eternal
word
and
this
word
is
the
life
to
which
lazarus
has
been
raised
it
is
a
case
of
illness
not
one
leading
to
death
but
to
the
glory
the
manifestation
of
god
if
the
eternal
word
has
reawakened
in
lazarus
the
whole
event
conduces
to
manifest
god
in
lazarus
for
by
means
of
the
event
lazarus
has
become
a
different
man
before
it
the
word
or
spirit
did
not
live
in
him
now
it
does
the
spirit
has
been
born
within
him
it
is
true
that
every
birth
is
accompanied
by
illness
that
of
the
mother
but
the
illness
leads
to
new
life
not
to
death
in
lazarus
that
part
of
him
becomes
ill
from
which
the
new
man
permeated
by
the
word
is
born
where
is
the
grave
from
which
the
word
is
born
to
answer
this
question
we
have
only
to
remember
plato
who
calls
man
body
the
tomb
of
the
soul
and
we
have
only
to
recall
plato
speaking
of
a
kind
of
resurrection
when
he
alludes
to
the
coming
to
life
of
the
spiritual
world
in
the
body
what
plato
calls
the
spiritual
soul
john
denominates
the
word
and
for
him
christ
is
the
word
plato
might
have
said
one
who
becomes
spiritual
has
caused
something
divine
to
rise
out
of
the
grave
of
his
body
for
john
that
which
took
place
through
the
life
of
jesus
was
that
resurrection
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
if
he
makes
jesus
say
i
am
the
resurrection
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
occurrence
at
bethany
was
an
awakening
in
the
spiritual
sense
lazarus
became
something
different
from
what
he
was
before
he
was
raised
to
a
life
of
which
the
eternal
word
could
say
i
am
that
life
what
then
took
place
in
lazarus
the
spirit
came
to
life
within
him
he
became
a
partaker
of
the
life
which
is
eternal
we
have
only
to
express
his
experience
in
the
words
of
those
who
were
initiated
into
the
mysteries
and
the
meaning
at
once
becomes
clear
what
does
plutarch
say
about
the
object
of
the
mysteries
they
were
to
serve
to
withdraw
the
soul
from
bodily
life
and
to
unite
it
with
the
gods
schelling
thus
describes
the
feelings
of
an
initiate
the
initiate
through
his
initiation
became
a
link
in
the
magic
chain
he
himself
became
a
kabir
he
was
admitted
into
an
indestructible
association
and
as
ancient
inscriptions
express
it
joined
to
the
army
of
the
higher
gods
schelling
der
and
the
revolution
that
took
place
in
the
life
of
one
who
received
initiation
can
not
be
more
significantly
described
than
in
the
words
spoken
by
ädesius
to
his
disciple
the
emperor
constantine
if
one
day
thou
shouldst
take
part
in
the
mysteries
thou
wilt
feel
ashamed
of
having
been
born
merely
as
a
man
if
we
fill
our
souls
with
such
feelings
as
these
we
shall
gain
the
right
attitude
towards
the
event
that
took
place
at
bethany
and
have
a
peculiarly
characteristic
experience
through
john
narrative
a
certainty
will
dawn
upon
us
which
can
not
be
obtained
by
any
logical
interpretation
or
by
any
attempt
at
rationalistic
explanation
a
mystery
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
is
before
us
the
eternal
word
entered
into
lazarus
in
the
language
of
the
mysteries
he
became
an
initiate
and
the
event
narrated
to
us
must
be
the
process
of
initiation
let
us
look
upon
the
whole
occurrence
as
though
it
were
an
initiation
lazarus
is
loved
by
jesus
john
xi
no
ordinary
affection
can
be
meant
by
this
for
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
gospel
in
which
jesus
is
the
word
jesus
loved
lazarus
because
he
found
him
ripe
for
the
awakening
of
the
word
within
him
jesus
had
relations
with
the
family
at
bethany
this
only
means
that
jesus
had
made
everything
ready
in
that
family
for
the
final
act
of
the
drama
the
raising
of
lazarus
the
latter
was
a
disciple
of
jesus
such
an
one
that
jesus
could
be
quite
sure
that
in
him
the
awakening
would
be
consummated
the
final
act
in
a
drama
of
awakening
consisted
in
a
symbolical
action
the
person
involved
in
it
had
not
only
to
understand
the
words
die
and
become
he
had
to
fulfil
them
himself
by
a
real
spiritual
action
his
earthly
part
of
which
his
higher
being
in
the
spirit
of
the
mysteries
must
be
ashamed
had
to
be
put
away
the
earthly
must
die
a
death
the
putting
of
his
body
into
a
somnambulic
sleep
for
three
days
can
only
be
denoted
an
outer
event
in
comparison
with
the
greatness
of
the
transformation
which
was
taking
place
in
him
an
incomparably
more
momentous
spiritual
event
corresponded
to
it
but
this
very
process
was
the
experience
which
divides
the
life
of
the
mystic
into
two
parts
one
who
does
not
know
from
experience
the
inner
significance
of
such
acts
can
not
understand
them
they
can
only
be
suggested
by
means
of
a
comparison
the
substance
of
shakespeare
may
be
compressed
into
a
few
words
any
one
who
learns
these
words
may
say
that
in
a
certain
sense
he
knows
the
contents
of
and
logically
he
does
but
one
who
has
let
all
the
wealth
of
the
shakespearian
drama
stream
in
upon
him
knows
in
a
different
way
a
has
passed
through
his
soul
which
can
not
be
replaced
by
any
mere
description
the
idea
of
has
become
an
artistic
personal
experience
within
him
on
a
higher
plane
of
consciousness
a
similar
process
takes
place
in
man
when
he
experiences
the
magically
significant
event
which
is
bound
up
with
initiation
what
he
attains
spiritually
he
lives
through
symbolically
the
word
symbolically
is
used
here
in
the
sense
that
an
outer
event
is
really
enacted
on
the
physical
plane
but
that
as
such
it
is
nevertheless
a
symbol
it
is
not
a
case
of
an
unreal
but
of
a
real
symbol
the
earthly
body
has
really
been
dead
for
three
days
new
life
comes
forth
from
death
this
life
has
outlived
death
man
has
gained
confidence
in
the
new
life
it
happened
thus
with
lazarus
jesus
had
prepared
him
for
resurrection
his
illness
was
at
once
symbolic
and
real
an
illness
which
was
an
initiation
and
which
leads
after
three
days
to
a
really
new
life
lazarus
was
ripe
for
undergoing
this
experience
he
wrapped
himself
in
the
garment
of
the
mystic
and
fell
into
a
condition
of
lifelessness
which
was
symbolic
death
and
when
jesus
came
the
three
days
had
elapsed
then
they
took
away
the
stone
from
the
place
where
the
dead
was
laid
and
jesus
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
said
i
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
heard
me
john
xi
the
father
had
heard
jesus
for
lazarus
had
come
to
the
final
act
in
the
great
drama
of
knowledge
he
had
learned
how
resurrection
is
attained
an
initiation
into
the
mysteries
had
been
consummated
it
was
a
case
of
such
an
initiation
as
had
been
understood
as
such
during
the
whole
of
antiquity
it
had
taken
place
through
jesus
as
the
initiator
union
with
the
divine
had
always
been
conceived
of
in
this
way
in
lazarus
jesus
accomplished
the
great
miracle
of
the
transmutation
of
life
in
the
sense
of
immemorial
tradition
through
this
event
christianity
is
connected
with
the
mysteries
lazarus
had
become
an
initiate
through
christ
jesus
himself
and
had
thereby
become
able
to
enter
the
higher
worlds
he
was
at
once
the
first
christian
initiate
and
the
first
to
be
initiated
by
christ
jesus
himself
through
his
initiation
he
had
become
capable
of
recognising
that
the
word
which
had
been
awakened
within
him
had
become
a
person
in
christ
jesus
and
that
consequently
there
stood
before
him
in
the
personality
of
his
awakener
the
same
force
which
had
been
spiritually
manifested
within
him
from
this
point
of
view
these
words
of
jesus
are
significant
and
i
knew
that
thou
hearest
me
always
but
because
of
the
people
which
stand
by
i
said
it
that
they
may
believe
that
thou
hast
sent
me
this
means
that
the
point
is
to
make
evident
this
fact
in
jesus
lives
the
son
of
the
father
in
such
a
way
that
when
he
awakens
his
own
nature
in
man
man
becomes
a
mystic
in
this
way
jesus
made
it
plain
that
the
meaning
of
life
was
hidden
in
the
mysteries
and
that
they
were
the
path
to
this
understanding
he
is
the
living
word
in
him
was
personified
what
had
been
immemorial
tradition
and
therefore
the
evangelist
is
justified
in
expressing
this
in
the
sentence
in
him
the
word
was
made
flesh
he
rightly
sees
in
jesus
himself
an
incarnated
mystery
on
this
account
john
gospel
is
a
mystery
in
order
to
read
it
rightly
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
facts
are
spiritual
facts
if
a
priest
of
the
old
order
had
written
it
he
would
have
described
traditional
rites
these
for
john
took
the
form
of
a
person
and
became
the
life
of
jesus
an
eminent
modern
investigator
of
the
mysteries
burkhardt
in
zeit
says
that
they
will
never
be
cleared
up
this
is
because
he
has
not
found
out
how
to
explain
them
if
we
take
the
gospel
of
john
and
see
in
it
the
working
out
in
reality
the
drama
of
knowledge
presented
by
the
ancients
we
are
really
gazing
upon
the
mystery
itself
in
the
words
lazarus
come
forth
we
can
recognise
the
call
with
which
the
egyptian
priestly
initiators
summoned
back
to
life
those
who
temporarily
removed
from
the
world
by
the
processes
of
initiation
had
undergone
them
in
order
to
die
to
earthly
things
and
to
gain
a
conviction
of
the
reality
of
the
eternal
jesus
in
this
way
revealed
the
secret
of
the
mysteries
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
the
jews
could
not
let
such
an
act
go
unpunished
any
more
than
the
greeks
could
have
refrained
from
punishing
æschylus
if
he
had
betrayed
the
secrets
of
the
mysteries
the
main
point
for
jesus
was
to
represent
in
the
initiation
of
lazarus
before
all
the
people
which
stood
by
an
event
which
in
the
old
days
of
priestly
wisdom
could
only
be
enacted
in
the
recesses
of
the
the
initiation
of
lazarus
was
to
prepare
the
way
to
the
understanding
of
the
mystery
of
golgotha
previously
only
those
who
saw
that
is
to
say
who
were
initiated
were
able
to
know
something
of
what
was
achieved
by
initiation
but
now
a
conviction
of
the
mysteries
of
higher
worlds
could
also
be
gained
by
those
who
had
not
seen
and
yet
had
believed
footnotes
this
and
other
circumstances
connected
with
the
raising
of
lazarus
from
the
dead
are
to
be
understood
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
lazarus
was
at
the
same
time
symbolic
and
real
it
was
in
other
words
a
symbolic
reality
a
reality
symbolising
other
realities
and
but
for
the
action
of
christ
lazarus
would
have
remained
dead
ix
the
apocalypse
of
john
at
the
end
of
the
new
testament
stands
a
remarkable
document
the
apocalypse
the
secret
revelation
of
john
we
have
only
to
read
the
opening
words
to
feel
the
deep
mystic
character
of
this
book
the
revelation
of
jesus
christ
which
god
gave
unto
him
to
shew
unto
his
servants
how
the
necessary
things
are
shortly
going
to
happen
and
this
is
sent
in
signs
by
the
angel
of
god
unto
his
servant
john
what
is
here
revealed
is
sent
in
signs
therefore
we
must
not
take
the
literal
meaning
of
the
words
as
they
stand
but
seek
for
a
deeper
meaning
of
which
the
words
are
only
signs
but
there
are
other
things
also
which
point
to
a
hidden
meaning
john
addresses
himself
to
the
seven
churches
in
asia
not
actual
material
churches
are
meant
the
number
seven
is
the
sacred
number
chosen
on
account
of
its
symbolic
meaning
the
actual
number
of
the
asiatic
churches
was
different
and
the
manner
in
which
john
arrived
at
the
revelation
also
points
to
something
mysterious
i
was
in
the
spirit
on
the
lord
day
and
heard
behind
me
a
great
voice
as
of
a
trumpet
saying
thou
seest
write
in
a
book
and
send
it
unto
the
seven
churches
thus
we
have
to
do
with
a
revelation
received
by
john
in
the
spirit
and
it
is
the
revelation
of
jesus
christ
wrapped
in
a
hidden
meaning
there
appears
what
christ
jesus
manifested
to
the
world
therefore
we
must
also
look
for
this
hidden
meaning
in
the
teachings
of
christ
this
revelation
bears
the
same
relation
to
ordinary
christianity
as
was
borne
by
the
revelation
of
the
mysteries
in
times
to
the
people
religion
on
this
account
the
attempt
to
treat
the
apocalypse
as
a
mystery
appears
to
be
justified
the
apocalypse
is
addressed
to
seven
churches
for
the
reason
of
this
we
have
only
to
single
out
one
of
the
seven
messages
sent
in
the
first
of
these
it
is
said
unto
the
angel
of
the
church
of
ephesus
write
these
things
saith
he
that
holdeth
the
seven
stars
in
his
right
hand
who
walketh
in
the
midst
of
the
seven
golden
candlesticks
i
know
thy
works
and
thy
labour
and
thy
patience
and
how
thou
canst
not
bear
them
which
are
evil
and
thou
hast
tried
them
which
say
they
are
apostles
and
are
not
and
hast
found
them
liars
and
hast
borne
and
hast
patience
and
for
my
name
sake
hast
laboured
and
hast
not
fainted
nevertheless
i
have
somewhat
against
thee
because
thou
hast
left
thy
highest
love
remember
therefore
from
whence
thou
art
fallen
and
repent
and
do
the
best
works
or
else
i
will
come
unto
thee
quickly
and
will
remove
thy
candlestick
out
of
his
place
except
thou
repent
but
this
thou
hast
that
thou
hatest
the
deeds
of
the
nicolaitanes
which
i
also
hate
he
that
hath
an
ear
let
him
hear
what
the
spirit
saith
unto
the
churches
to
him
that
overcometh
will
i
give
to
eat
of
the
tree
of
life
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
paradise
of
god
this
is
the
message
addressed
to
the
angel
of
the
first
community
the
angel
who
represents
the
spirit
of
this
community
has
entered
upon
the
path
pointed
out
by
christianity
he
is
able
to
distinguish
between
the
false
adherents
of
christianity
and
the
true
he
wishes
to
be
christian
and
has
founded
his
work
on
the
name
of
christ
but
it
is
required
of
him
that
he
should
not
bar
his
own
way
to
the
highest
love
by
any
kind
of
mistakes
he
is
shown
the
possibility
of
taking
a
wrong
course
through
such
errors
through
christ
jesus
the
way
for
attaining
to
the
divine
has
been
pointed
out
perseverance
is
needed
for
advancing
further
in
the
spirit
in
which
the
first
impulse
was
given
it
is
possible
to
believe
too
soon
that
one
has
the
right
spirit
this
happens
when
the
disciple
lets
himself
be
led
a
short
way
by
christ
and
then
leaves
his
leadership
giving
way
to
false
ideas
about
it
the
disciple
thereby
falls
back
again
into
the
lower
self
he
has
left
his
highest
love
the
knowledge
which
is
attached
to
the
senses
and
intellect
may
be
raised
into
a
higher
sphere
becoming
wisdom
by
being
spiritualised
and
made
divine
if
it
does
not
reach
this
height
it
remains
amongst
perishable
things
christ
jesus
has
pointed
out
the
path
to
the
eternal
and
knowledge
must
with
unwearied
perseverance
follow
the
path
which
leads
to
its
becoming
divine
lovingly
must
it
trace
out
the
methods
which
transmute
it
into
wisdom
the
nicolaitanes
were
a
sect
who
took
christianity
too
lightly
they
saw
one
thing
only
that
christ
is
the
divine
word
the
eternal
wisdom
which
is
born
in
man
therefore
they
concluded
that
human
wisdom
was
the
divine
word
and
that
it
was
enough
to
pursue
human
knowledge
in
order
to
realise
the
divine
in
the
world
but
the
meaning
of
christian
wisdom
can
not
be
construed
thus
the
knowledge
which
in
the
first
instance
is
human
wisdom
is
as
perishable
as
anything
else
unless
it
is
first
transmuted
into
divine
wisdom
thou
art
not
thus
says
the
spirit
to
the
angel
of
ephesus
thou
hast
relied
merely
upon
human
wisdom
thou
hast
patiently
trodden
the
christian
path
but
thou
must
not
think
that
the
love
is
not
needed
to
attain
to
the
goal
such
a
love
is
necessary
which
far
surpasses
all
love
to
other
things
only
such
can
be
the
love
the
path
to
the
divine
is
an
infinite
one
and
it
is
to
be
understood
that
when
the
first
step
has
been
gained
it
can
only
be
the
preparation
for
ascending
higher
and
higher
such
is
the
first
of
these
messages
as
they
are
to
be
interpreted
the
meaning
of
the
others
may
be
found
in
a
similar
way
john
turned
and
saw
seven
golden
candlesticks
and
in
the
midst
of
the
seven
candlesticks
one
like
unto
the
son
of
man
clothed
with
a
garment
down
to
the
foot
and
girt
about
the
paps
with
a
golden
girdle
his
head
and
his
hairs
were
white
like
wool
as
white
as
snow
and
his
eyes
were
as
a
flame
of
fire
we
are
told
i
that
the
seven
candlesticks
are
the
seven
churches
this
means
that
the
candlesticks
are
seven
different
ways
of
attaining
to
the
divine
they
are
all
more
or
less
imperfect
and
the
son
of
man
had
in
his
right
hand
seven
stars
the
seven
stars
are
the
angels
of
the
seven
churches
the
guiding
spirits
or
daimons
of
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
have
here
become
the
guiding
angels
of
the
churches
the
churches
are
represented
as
bodies
for
spiritual
beings
and
the
angels
are
the
souls
of
those
bodies
just
as
human
souls
are
the
guiding
powers
of
human
bodies
the
churches
are
the
imperfect
ways
to
the
divine
and
the
souls
of
the
churches
were
to
become
guides
along
those
paths
for
this
purpose
they
must
themselves
have
for
their
leader
the
being
who
has
in
his
right
hand
seven
stars
and
out
of
his
mouth
went
a
sharp
sword
and
his
countenance
was
as
the
sun
shineth
in
his
strength
this
sword
is
also
found
in
the
mysteries
the
candidate
for
initiation
was
terrified
by
a
flashing
sword
this
indicates
the
situation
of
one
who
wishes
to
know
the
divine
by
experience
so
that
the
face
of
wisdom
may
shine
upon
him
like
the
sun
john
also
goes
through
this
experience
it
is
to
be
a
test
of
his
strength
and
when
i
saw
him
i
fell
at
his
feet
as
dead
and
he
laid
his
right
hand
upon
me
saying
unto
me
fear
not
the
candidate
for
initiation
must
pass
through
the
experiences
which
otherwise
man
only
undergoes
at
the
gate
of
death
his
guide
must
lead
him
beyond
the
region
in
which
birth
and
death
have
a
meaning
the
initiate
enters
upon
a
new
life
and
i
was
dead
and
behold
i
am
alive
for
evermore
amen
and
have
the
keys
of
hell
and
of
death
thus
prepared
john
is
led
on
to
learn
the
secrets
of
existence
after
this
i
looked
and
behold
a
door
was
opened
in
heaven
and
the
first
voice
which
i
heard
was
as
it
were
of
a
trumpet
talking
with
me
which
said
come
up
hither
and
i
will
shew
thee
things
which
must
be
hereafter
the
messages
to
the
seven
spirits
of
the
churches
make
known
to
john
what
is
to
take
place
in
the
physical
world
in
order
to
prepare
the
way
for
christianity
what
he
now
sees
in
the
spirit
takes
him
to
the
spiritual
of
things
hidden
behind
physical
evolution
but
which
will
be
realised
in
a
spiritualised
age
in
the
near
future
by
means
of
physical
evolution
the
initiate
experiences
now
in
the
spirit
what
is
to
happen
in
the
future
and
immediately
i
was
in
the
spirit
and
behold
a
throne
was
set
in
heaven
and
one
sat
on
the
throne
and
he
that
sat
was
to
look
upon
like
a
jasper
and
a
sardine
stone
and
there
was
a
rainbow
round
about
the
throne
in
sight
like
unto
an
emerald
in
this
way
is
described
the
source
of
things
in
the
world
of
sense
in
the
pictures
in
which
it
appears
to
the
seer
and
round
about
the
throne
were
four
and
twenty
seats
and
upon
the
seats
i
saw
four
and
twenty
elders
sitting
clothed
in
white
raiment
and
they
had
on
their
heads
crowns
of
gold
iv
the
beings
far
advanced
on
the
path
of
wisdom
thus
surround
the
of
existence
to
gaze
on
its
infinite
essence
and
bear
testimony
to
it
and
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
and
round
about
the
throne
were
four
beasts
full
of
eyes
before
and
behind
and
the
first
beast
was
like
a
lion
and
the
second
beast
like
a
calf
and
the
third
beast
had
a
face
as
a
man
and
the
fourth
beast
was
like
a
flying
eagle
and
the
four
beasts
had
each
of
them
six
wings
about
him
and
they
were
full
of
eyes
within
and
they
rest
not
day
and
night
saying
holy
holy
holy
lord
god
almighty
which
was
and
is
and
is
to
come
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
that
the
four
beasts
represent
the
supersensible
life
underlying
physical
forms
of
life
afterwards
when
the
trumpets
sound
they
lift
up
their
voices
when
the
life
expressed
in
has
been
transmuted
into
spiritual
life
in
the
right
hand
of
him
who
sits
on
the
throne
is
the
book
in
which
the
path
to
the
highest
wisdom
is
traced
out
there
is
only
one
worthy
to
open
the
book
behold
the
lion
of
the
tribe
of
juda
the
root
of
david
hath
prevailed
to
open
the
book
and
to
loose
the
seven
seals
thereof
the
seven
seals
of
the
book
denote
that
human
wisdom
is
sevenfold
that
this
is
so
is
again
connected
with
the
sacred
character
of
the
number
seven
the
mystic
wisdom
of
philo
designates
as
seals
the
eternal
cosmic
thoughts
which
come
to
expression
in
things
human
wisdom
seeks
for
those
creative
thoughts
but
only
in
the
book
which
is
sealed
with
them
is
divine
truth
to
be
found
the
fundamental
thoughts
of
creation
must
first
be
unveiled
the
seals
must
be
opened
before
what
is
in
the
book
can
be
revealed
jesus
the
lion
has
power
to
open
the
seals
he
has
given
a
direction
to
the
great
creative
thoughts
which
through
them
leads
to
wisdom
the
lamb
that
was
slain
and
that
has
bought
its
divinity
with
its
blood
jesus
who
drew
down
the
christ
into
himself
and
who
thus
in
the
supreme
sense
passed
through
the
opens
the
book
and
as
each
seal
is
opened
vi
the
four
beasts
declare
what
they
know
at
the
opening
of
the
first
seal
john
sees
a
white
horse
on
which
sits
a
rider
with
a
bow
the
first
universal
power
an
embodiment
of
creative
thought
becomes
visible
it
is
put
into
the
right
direction
by
the
new
rider
christianity
strife
is
allayed
by
the
new
faith
at
the
opening
of
the
second
seal
a
red
horse
appears
ridden
by
one
who
takes
away
from
the
earth
peace
the
second
universal
power
so
that
humanity
may
not
neglect
through
sloth
to
cultivate
divine
things
the
opening
of
the
third
seal
shows
the
universal
power
of
justice
guided
by
christianity
the
fourth
brings
the
power
of
religion
which
through
christianity
has
received
new
dignity
the
meaning
of
the
four
beasts
thus
becomes
plain
they
are
the
four
chief
universal
powers
to
which
christianity
gives
a
new
direction
war
the
lion
peaceful
work
the
bull
justice
the
being
with
the
human
face
and
religious
enthusiasm
the
eagle
the
meaning
of
the
third
being
becomes
clear
when
it
is
said
at
the
opening
of
the
third
seal
a
measure
of
wheat
for
a
penny
and
three
measures
of
barley
for
a
penny
and
that
the
rider
holds
a
pair
of
balances
and
at
the
opening
of
the
fourth
seal
a
rider
becomes
visible
whose
name
was
death
and
hell
followed
with
him
this
rider
is
religious
justice
vi
when
the
fifth
seal
is
opened
there
appear
the
souls
of
those
who
have
already
acted
in
the
spirit
of
christianity
creative
thought
itself
embodied
in
christianity
shows
itself
here
but
by
this
christianity
is
at
first
meant
only
the
first
christian
community
which
was
transitory
like
other
forms
of
creation
the
sixth
seal
is
opened
vi
it
is
made
evident
that
the
spiritual
world
of
christianity
is
an
eternal
world
the
people
at
large
seem
to
be
permeated
by
that
spiritual
world
out
of
which
christianity
itself
proceeded
what
it
has
itself
created
becomes
sanctified
and
i
heard
the
number
of
them
which
were
sealed
and
there
were
sealed
an
hundred
and
forty
and
four
thousand
of
all
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
israel
vii
they
are
those
who
prepared
for
the
eternal
before
the
coming
of
christianity
and
who
were
transformed
by
the
the
opening
of
the
seventh
seal
follows
it
becomes
evident
what
true
christianity
is
to
be
in
the
evolution
of
the
world
the
seven
angels
which
stood
before
god
appear
rev
viii
again
these
angels
are
spirits
from
the
ancient
mysteries
transferred
to
christianity
they
are
the
spirits
who
lead
to
the
vision
of
god
in
a
really
christian
way
therefore
what
is
next
accomplished
is
a
leading
to
god
it
is
an
initiation
which
is
bestowed
upon
john
the
proclamations
of
the
angels
are
accompanied
by
the
necessary
signs
during
initiations
the
first
angel
sounded
and
there
followed
hail
and
fire
mingled
with
blood
and
they
were
cast
upon
the
earth
and
the
third
part
of
trees
was
burnt
up
and
all
green
grass
was
burnt
up
and
similar
things
take
place
when
the
other
angels
sound
their
trumpets
at
this
point
we
see
that
this
was
not
merely
an
initiation
in
the
old
sense
but
that
a
new
one
was
taking
the
place
of
the
old
christianity
was
not
to
be
confined
like
the
ancient
mysteries
to
a
few
elect
ones
it
was
to
belong
to
the
whole
of
humanity
it
was
to
be
a
religion
of
the
people
the
truth
was
to
be
ready
for
each
one
who
has
ears
to
hear
the
old
mystics
were
singled
out
from
a
great
number
the
trumpets
of
christianity
sound
for
every
one
who
is
willing
to
hear
them
whether
he
draws
near
or
not
depends
on
himself
this
is
the
reason
why
the
terrors
accompanying
this
initiation
of
humanity
are
so
enormously
enhanced
what
is
to
become
of
the
earth
and
its
inhabitants
in
a
far
distant
future
is
revealed
to
john
at
his
initiation
underlying
this
is
the
thought
that
initiates
are
able
to
foresee
in
higher
worlds
what
is
realised
in
the
lower
world
only
in
the
future
the
seven
messages
present
the
meaning
of
christianity
to
that
age
the
seven
seals
represent
what
was
then
being
prepared
through
christianity
for
future
accomplishment
the
future
is
veiled
and
sealed
to
the
uninitiated
it
is
unsealed
in
initiation
when
the
earthly
period
is
over
during
which
the
seven
messages
hold
good
a
more
spiritual
time
will
begin
then
life
will
no
more
flow
on
as
it
appears
in
physical
forms
but
even
outwardly
it
will
be
a
copy
of
its
supersensible
forms
these
latter
are
represented
by
the
four
animals
and
the
other
in
a
still
later
future
appears
that
form
of
the
earth
which
the
initiate
experiences
through
the
trumpets
thus
the
initiate
prophetically
goes
through
what
is
to
happen
and
the
christian
initiate
learns
how
the
interposes
and
works
on
in
earthly
evolution
after
it
has
been
shown
how
all
that
is
too
much
attached
to
perishable
things
perishes
to
attain
true
christianity
there
appears
the
mighty
angel
with
a
little
book
open
in
his
hand
which
he
gives
to
john
and
he
said
unto
me
take
it
and
eat
it
up
and
it
shall
make
thy
belly
bitter
but
it
shall
be
in
thy
mouth
sweet
as
honey
x
john
was
not
only
to
read
the
little
book
he
was
to
absorb
it
and
let
its
contents
permeate
him
what
avails
any
knowledge
unless
man
is
vitally
and
thoroughly
imbued
with
it
wisdom
has
to
become
life
man
must
not
merely
recognise
the
divine
but
become
divine
himself
such
wisdom
as
is
written
in
the
book
no
doubt
causes
pain
to
the
perishable
part
of
man
it
shall
make
thy
belly
bitter
but
so
much
the
more
does
it
make
happy
the
eternal
part
but
it
shall
be
in
thy
mouth
sweet
as
honey
only
by
such
an
initiation
can
christianity
become
actual
on
the
earth
it
kills
everything
belonging
to
the
lower
nature
and
their
dead
bodies
shall
lie
in
the
street
of
the
great
city
which
spiritually
is
called
sodom
and
egypt
where
also
our
lord
was
crucified
by
this
is
meant
the
followers
of
christ
who
are
by
the
temporal
powers
but
what
is
is
only
the
mortal
part
of
human
nature
which
they
will
afterwards
have
conquered
thereby
their
fate
is
a
copy
of
the
prefiguring
fate
of
christ
jesus
spiritually
sodom
and
egypt
is
the
symbol
of
a
life
which
cleaves
to
the
outer
and
is
not
changed
by
the
christ
is
everywhere
crucified
in
the
lower
nature
when
the
lower
nature
conquers
all
remains
dead
the
dead
bodies
of
men
lie
about
in
the
public
places
of
cities
those
who
overcome
the
lower
nature
and
awaken
the
crucified
christ
hear
the
trumpet
of
the
seventh
angel
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
are
become
the
kingdoms
of
our
lord
and
of
his
christ
and
he
shall
reign
for
ever
and
ever
xi
and
the
temple
of
god
was
opened
in
heaven
and
there
was
seen
in
his
temple
the
ark
of
his
testament
xi
in
the
vision
of
these
events
the
initiate
sees
renewed
the
old
struggle
between
the
lower
and
the
higher
natures
for
everything
which
the
candidate
for
initiation
formerly
had
to
go
through
must
be
repeated
in
one
who
follows
the
christian
path
just
as
osiris
was
threatened
by
the
evil
typhon
so
now
the
great
dragon
that
old
serpent
xii
must
be
overcome
the
woman
the
human
soul
gives
birth
to
lower
knowledge
which
is
an
adverse
power
if
it
is
not
raised
to
wisdom
man
must
pass
through
that
lower
knowledge
in
the
apocalypse
it
appears
as
the
old
serpent
from
the
remotest
times
the
serpent
had
been
the
symbol
of
knowledge
in
all
mystic
wisdom
man
may
be
led
astray
by
this
serpent
knowledge
if
he
does
not
bring
to
life
in
him
the
son
of
god
who
crushes
the
serpent
head
and
the
great
dragon
was
cast
out
that
old
serpent
called
the
devil
and
satan
which
deceiveth
the
whole
world
he
was
cast
out
into
the
earth
and
his
angels
were
cast
out
with
him
xii
in
these
words
we
can
see
what
it
was
that
christianity
wished
to
be
a
new
kind
of
initiation
what
had
been
attained
in
the
mysteries
was
to
be
attained
in
a
new
form
for
in
them
too
the
serpent
had
to
be
overcome
but
this
was
no
longer
to
take
place
in
the
old
way
the
one
primeval
mystery
the
christian
mystery
was
to
replace
the
many
mysteries
of
antiquity
jesus
in
whom
the
logos
had
been
made
flesh
was
to
become
the
initiator
of
the
whole
of
humanity
and
humanity
was
to
be
his
own
community
of
mystics
what
was
to
take
place
was
not
a
separation
of
the
elect
but
a
linking
together
of
all
as
each
grows
up
to
it
so
does
he
become
a
mystic
the
good
tidings
are
announced
to
all
he
who
has
an
ear
to
hear
hastens
to
learn
the
secrets
the
voice
of
the
heart
is
to
decide
in
each
individual
case
it
is
not
that
one
person
at
a
time
is
introduced
into
the
but
that
the
word
is
to
be
spoken
to
all
to
one
it
will
then
appeal
more
strongly
than
to
another
it
will
be
left
to
the
daimon
the
angel
within
each
individual
to
decide
how
far
the
latter
may
be
initiated
the
whole
world
is
a
not
only
is
salvation
to
come
to
those
who
see
the
wonderful
processes
in
the
special
temples
for
initiation
processes
which
give
them
a
guarantee
of
eternal
life
but
blessed
are
they
that
have
not
seen
and
yet
have
believed
even
if
at
first
they
grope
in
the
dark
the
light
may
nevertheless
come
to
them
later
nothing
is
to
be
withheld
from
any
one
the
way
is
to
be
open
to
all
the
latter
part
of
the
apocalypse
describes
clearly
the
dangers
threatening
christianity
through
powers
and
the
final
triumph
of
christianity
all
other
gods
are
merged
in
the
one
christian
divinity
and
the
city
had
no
need
of
the
sun
neither
of
the
moon
to
shine
in
it
for
the
glory
of
god
did
lighten
it
and
the
lamb
is
the
light
thereof
xxi
the
secret
of
the
revelation
of
john
is
that
the
mysteries
are
no
longer
to
be
kept
under
lock
and
key
and
he
saith
unto
me
seal
not
the
sayings
of
the
prophecy
of
this
book
for
the
time
is
at
hand
the
author
of
the
apocalypse
has
set
forth
what
he
believes
to
be
the
relation
of
his
church
to
the
churches
of
antiquity
he
wished
to
express
in
a
spiritual
mystery
what
he
thought
about
the
mysteries
themselves
he
wrote
his
mystery
on
the
isle
of
patmos
and
he
is
said
to
have
received
the
revelation
in
a
grotto
these
details
indicate
that
the
revelation
was
of
a
mystery
character
thus
christianity
arose
out
of
the
mysteries
its
wisdom
is
born
as
a
mystery
in
the
apocalypse
but
a
mystery
which
transcends
the
limits
of
the
old
mystery
world
the
separate
mysteries
were
to
become
one
universal
one
it
may
appear
to
be
a
contradiction
to
say
that
the
secrets
of
the
mysteries
became
manifest
through
christianity
and
that
nevertheless
a
christian
mystery
is
to
be
seen
again
in
the
spiritual
visions
of
the
writer
of
the
apocalypse
the
contradiction
disappears
directly
we
reflect
that
the
secrets
of
the
ancient
mysteries
were
revealed
by
the
events
in
palestine
through
these
there
became
manifest
what
had
previously
been
veiled
in
the
mysteries
there
is
now
a
new
secret
namely
what
has
been
introduced
into
the
evolution
of
the
world
by
the
appearance
of
the
christ
the
initiate
of
ancient
times
when
in
the
spiritual
world
saw
how
evolution
points
the
way
to
the
as
yet
hidden
christ
the
christian
initiate
experiences
the
unseen
effects
of
the
manifested
christ
x
jesus
and
his
historical
background
in
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
is
to
be
sought
the
soil
out
of
which
grew
the
spirit
of
christianity
all
that
was
needed
was
the
gaining
ground
of
the
fundamental
conviction
that
this
spirit
must
be
introduced
into
life
in
greater
measure
than
had
been
the
case
with
the
mysteries
but
such
a
conviction
was
widely
spread
as
may
be
seen
from
the
manner
of
life
of
the
essenes
and
therapeutæ
who
existed
long
before
christianity
arose
the
essenes
were
a
secluded
sect
living
in
palestine
whose
numbers
at
the
time
of
christ
were
estimated
at
four
thousand
they
formed
a
community
which
required
that
its
members
should
lead
a
life
which
developed
a
higher
life
within
the
soul
and
brought
about
a
new
birth
the
aspirant
for
admission
was
subjected
to
a
severe
test
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
he
were
ripe
for
preparing
himself
for
a
higher
life
if
he
was
admitted
he
had
to
undergo
a
period
of
probation
and
to
take
a
solemn
oath
that
he
would
not
betray
to
strangers
the
secrets
of
the
essenian
discipline
the
object
of
this
life
was
the
conquest
of
the
lower
nature
in
man
so
that
the
spirit
latent
within
him
might
be
awakened
ever
more
and
more
one
who
had
experienced
up
to
a
certain
point
the
spirit
within
him
was
raised
to
a
higher
grade
and
enjoyed
a
corresponding
degree
of
authority
not
forced
from
without
but
conditioned
by
the
nature
of
things
akin
to
the
essenes
were
the
therapeutæ
who
dwelt
in
egypt
we
get
all
desirable
details
of
their
mode
of
life
in
a
treatise
by
the
philosopher
philo
the
contemplative
the
dispute
as
to
the
authenticity
of
this
work
must
now
be
regarded
as
settled
and
it
may
be
rightly
assumed
that
philo
really
described
the
life
of
a
community
existing
long
before
christianity
and
well
known
to
him
on
the
subject
mead
of
a
faith
a
few
passages
from
philo
treatise
will
give
an
idea
of
the
main
tenets
of
the
therapeutæ
the
dwellings
of
the
members
of
the
community
are
extremely
simple
only
affording
necessary
shelter
from
extreme
heat
and
cold
the
dwellings
are
not
built
close
together
as
in
towns
for
contiguity
has
no
attraction
for
one
who
wishes
for
solitude
nor
are
they
at
a
great
distance
one
from
another
in
order
that
the
social
relations
so
dear
to
them
may
not
be
made
difficult
and
that
they
may
easily
be
able
to
assist
each
other
in
case
of
an
attack
by
brigands
in
each
house
is
a
consecrated
room
called
a
temple
or
monasterion
a
small
room
or
cell
in
which
the
mysteries
of
the
higher
life
are
cultivated
they
also
possess
works
by
ancient
authors
who
once
directed
their
school
and
left
behind
many
explanations
about
the
customary
method
used
in
allegorical
writings
their
interpretation
of
sacred
writings
is
directed
to
the
deeper
meaning
of
allegorical
narratives
we
thus
see
that
what
had
been
striven
after
in
the
narrower
circle
of
the
mysteries
was
being
made
general
but
such
a
generalisation
naturally
weakened
their
severe
character
the
essene
and
therapeutic
communities
form
a
natural
transition
from
the
mysteries
to
christianity
but
christianity
wished
to
extend
to
humanity
in
general
what
with
the
essenes
and
therapeutæ
was
an
affair
of
a
sect
this
of
course
prepared
the
way
for
a
still
further
weakening
of
the
old
severe
forms
the
existence
of
such
sects
makes
it
possible
to
understand
how
far
the
time
was
ripe
for
the
comprehension
of
the
mystery
of
christ
in
the
mysteries
a
man
was
artificially
prepared
for
the
dawning
upon
his
consciousness
at
the
appropriate
time
of
the
spiritual
world
within
the
essene
or
therapeutic
community
the
soul
sought
by
a
certain
mode
of
life
to
become
ripe
for
the
awakening
of
the
higher
man
a
further
step
forward
is
that
man
struggles
through
to
a
feeling
that
a
human
individuality
may
have
evolved
to
higher
and
higher
stages
of
perfection
in
repeated
earth
lives
one
who
had
arrived
at
a
glimpse
of
this
truth
would
also
be
able
to
feel
that
in
jesus
a
being
of
lofty
spirituality
had
appeared
the
loftier
the
spirituality
the
greater
the
possibility
of
accomplishing
something
of
importance
thus
the
individuality
of
jesus
could
become
capable
of
accomplishing
the
deed
which
the
evangelists
so
mysteriously
indicate
in
the
baptism
by
john
and
which
by
the
way
in
which
they
speak
of
it
they
so
clearly
point
out
as
of
the
utmost
importance
the
personality
of
jesus
became
able
to
receive
into
its
own
soul
christ
the
logos
who
was
made
flesh
in
that
soul
thenceforward
the
ego
of
jesus
of
nazareth
was
the
christ
and
the
outer
personality
was
the
vehicle
of
the
logos
the
event
of
the
ego
of
jesus
becoming
the
christ
is
enacted
in
the
baptism
by
john
during
the
period
of
the
mysteries
union
with
the
spirit
was
only
for
those
who
were
initiated
amongst
the
essenes
a
whole
community
cultivated
a
life
by
means
of
which
all
its
members
were
able
to
arrive
at
the
mystical
union
in
the
coming
of
christ
something
the
deeds
of
christ
was
placed
before
the
whole
of
humanity
so
that
all
might
share
in
the
mystical
union
xi
the
nature
of
christianity
the
deepest
effect
must
have
been
produced
upon
believers
in
christianity
by
the
fact
that
the
divine
the
word
the
eternal
logos
no
longer
came
to
them
in
the
dim
twilight
of
the
mysteries
as
spirit
only
but
that
when
they
spoke
of
the
logos
they
were
made
to
think
of
the
historical
human
personality
of
jesus
formerly
the
logos
had
only
been
seen
in
different
degrees
of
human
perfection
the
delicate
subtle
differences
in
the
spiritual
life
of
personalities
could
be
observed
and
the
manner
and
degree
in
which
the
logos
became
living
within
those
seeking
initiation
a
higher
degree
of
maturity
was
to
be
interpreted
as
a
higher
stage
of
evolution
of
spiritual
life
the
preparatory
steps
had
to
be
sought
in
a
spiritual
life
already
passed
through
and
the
present
life
was
to
be
regarded
as
the
preparatory
stage
for
future
degrees
of
spiritual
evolution
the
conservation
of
the
spiritual
power
of
the
soul
and
the
eternity
of
that
force
might
be
stated
in
the
words
of
the
jewish
occult
teaching
in
the
book
of
sohar
nothing
in
the
world
is
lost
nothing
falls
into
the
void
not
even
the
words
and
voice
of
man
everything
has
its
place
and
purport
personality
was
but
a
metamorphosis
of
the
soul
which
develops
from
one
personality
to
another
the
single
life
of
the
personality
was
only
considered
as
a
link
in
the
chain
of
development
stretching
backwards
and
forwards
this
logos
metamorphosing
itself
in
the
many
separate
human
personalities
has
through
christianity
been
directed
away
from
these
to
the
one
unique
personality
of
jesus
what
had
previously
been
distributed
throughout
the
world
was
now
united
in
a
single
personality
jesus
became
the
unique
in
jesus
something
was
present
once
which
must
appear
to
man
as
the
greatest
of
ideals
and
with
which
in
the
course
of
man
repeated
earthly
lives
he
ought
to
be
more
and
more
united
jesus
took
upon
himself
the
divinisation
of
the
whole
of
humanity
in
him
was
sought
what
formerly
could
only
be
sought
in
a
man
own
particular
soul
one
did
not
any
more
behold
the
divine
and
eternal
within
the
personality
of
a
man
all
that
was
now
beheld
in
jesus
it
is
not
the
eternal
part
of
the
soul
that
conquers
death
and
is
raised
through
its
own
power
as
divine
but
it
is
that
which
was
in
jesus
the
one
god
that
will
appear
and
raise
the
souls
it
follows
from
this
that
an
entirely
new
meaning
was
given
to
personality
the
eternal
immortal
part
had
been
taken
from
it
only
the
personality
as
such
was
left
if
immortality
be
not
denied
it
has
to
be
admitted
as
pertaining
to
the
personality
itself
out
of
the
belief
in
the
soul
eternal
metamorphosis
came
the
belief
in
personal
immortality
the
personality
acquired
infinite
importance
because
it
was
the
only
thing
which
was
left
to
man
henceforth
there
is
nothing
between
the
personality
and
the
infinite
god
a
direct
relation
with
him
must
be
established
man
was
no
longer
capable
of
himself
becoming
divine
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
he
was
simply
man
standing
in
a
direct
but
outward
relation
to
god
this
brought
quite
a
new
note
into
the
conception
of
the
world
for
those
who
knew
the
point
of
view
held
in
the
ancient
mysteries
there
were
many
people
in
this
position
during
the
first
centuries
of
christianity
they
knew
the
nature
of
the
mysteries
if
they
wished
to
become
christians
they
were
obliged
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
older
conceptions
this
brought
them
most
difficult
conflicts
within
their
souls
they
sought
in
most
various
ways
to
effect
a
settlement
between
the
two
tendencies
in
the
conception
of
the
world
this
conflict
is
reflected
in
the
writings
of
early
christian
times
in
those
of
heathens
attracted
by
the
sublimity
of
christianity
as
well
as
in
the
writings
of
those
christians
who
found
it
hard
to
give
up
the
conceptions
of
the
mysteries
slowly
did
christianity
grow
out
of
these
mysteries
on
the
one
hand
christian
convictions
were
presented
in
the
form
of
the
mystery
truths
and
on
the
other
the
mystery
wisdom
was
clothed
in
christian
words
clement
of
alexandria
ob
a
christian
writer
whose
education
had
been
pagan
is
an
instance
of
this
god
has
not
forbidden
us
to
rest
from
good
deeds
when
keeping
the
sabbath
he
permits
those
who
can
grasp
them
to
share
in
the
divine
mysteries
and
in
the
sacred
light
he
has
not
revealed
to
the
crowd
what
is
not
suitable
for
them
he
judged
it
fitting
to
reveal
it
only
to
a
few
who
are
able
to
grasp
it
and
to
work
out
in
themselves
the
unspeakable
mystery
which
god
confided
to
the
logos
not
to
the
written
word
and
god
hath
set
some
in
the
church
as
apostles
and
some
prophets
and
some
evangelists
and
some
pastors
and
teachers
for
the
perfecting
of
the
saints
for
the
work
of
the
ministry
for
the
edifying
of
the
body
of
christ
individual
souls
in
those
days
sought
by
very
different
paths
to
find
the
way
from
the
ancient
views
to
the
christian
ones
and
the
one
who
thought
he
was
on
the
right
path
called
others
heretics
in
the
meanwhile
the
church
grew
stronger
and
stronger
as
an
outward
institution
the
more
power
it
gained
the
more
did
the
path
recognised
as
the
right
one
by
the
decisions
of
councils
take
the
place
of
personal
investigation
it
was
for
the
church
to
decide
who
deviated
too
far
from
the
divine
truth
which
she
guarded
the
idea
of
a
heretic
took
firmer
and
firmer
shape
during
the
first
centuries
of
christianity
the
search
for
the
divine
path
was
a
much
more
personal
matter
than
it
afterwards
became
a
long
distance
had
been
travelled
before
augustine
conviction
became
possible
i
should
not
believe
in
the
truth
of
the
gospels
unless
the
authority
of
the
catholic
church
forced
me
to
do
so
the
conflict
between
the
method
of
the
mysteries
and
that
of
the
christian
religion
acquired
a
special
stamp
through
the
various
gnostic
sects
and
writers
we
may
class
as
gnostics
all
the
writers
of
the
first
christian
centuries
who
sought
for
a
deep
spiritual
meaning
in
christian
teachings
a
brilliant
account
of
the
development
of
the
gnosis
is
given
in
mead
book
mentioned
above
of
a
faith
we
understand
the
gnostics
when
we
look
upon
them
as
saturated
with
the
ancient
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
and
striving
to
understand
christianity
from
that
point
of
view
for
them
christ
was
the
logos
and
as
such
of
a
spiritual
nature
in
his
primal
essence
he
can
not
approach
man
from
without
he
must
be
awakened
in
the
soul
but
the
historical
jesus
must
bear
some
relation
to
the
spiritual
logos
this
was
the
crucial
point
for
the
gnostics
some
settled
it
in
one
way
some
in
another
the
essential
point
common
to
them
all
was
that
to
arrive
at
a
true
understanding
of
the
mere
historical
tradition
was
not
enough
but
that
it
must
be
sought
either
in
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
or
in
the
philosophy
which
was
derived
from
the
same
source
the
gnostics
had
confidence
in
human
wisdom
and
believed
it
capable
of
bringing
forth
a
christ
by
whom
the
historical
christ
could
be
measured
in
fact
through
whom
alone
the
latter
could
be
understood
and
beheld
in
the
right
light
of
special
interest
from
this
point
of
view
is
the
doctrine
given
in
the
books
of
dionysius
the
areopagite
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
mention
of
these
writings
till
the
sixth
century
it
matters
little
when
and
where
they
were
written
the
point
is
that
they
give
an
account
of
christianity
which
is
clothed
in
the
language
of
the
philosophy
and
presented
in
the
form
of
a
spiritual
contemplation
of
the
higher
world
at
all
events
this
is
a
form
of
delineation
which
belongs
to
the
first
christian
centuries
in
older
times
the
truth
was
handed
on
in
the
form
of
oral
tradition
the
most
important
things
were
not
entrusted
to
writing
the
christianity
described
in
the
writings
of
dionysius
is
set
forth
in
the
mirror
of
the
conception
of
the
world
troubles
man
spiritual
vision
he
must
reach
out
beyond
the
senses
but
all
human
ideas
are
primarily
derived
from
observation
by
the
senses
what
man
perceives
with
his
senses
he
calls
existence
what
he
does
not
so
perceive
he
calls
therefore
if
he
wishes
to
open
up
an
actual
view
of
the
divine
he
must
rise
above
existence
and
for
these
also
as
he
conceives
them
have
their
origin
in
the
sphere
of
the
senses
in
this
sense
god
is
neither
existent
nor
he
is
consequently
he
can
not
be
attained
by
means
of
ordinary
cognition
which
has
to
do
with
existing
things
we
have
to
be
raised
above
ourselves
above
our
above
our
reasoning
logic
if
we
are
to
find
the
way
to
spiritual
vision
thence
we
are
able
to
get
a
glimpse
into
the
perspectives
of
the
divine
but
this
divinity
has
brought
forth
the
logos
the
basis
of
the
universe
filled
with
wisdom
to
him
man
lower
powers
are
able
to
attain
he
is
present
in
the
cosmos
as
the
spiritual
son
of
god
he
is
the
mediator
between
god
and
man
he
may
be
present
in
man
in
various
degrees
he
may
for
instance
be
realised
in
an
external
institution
in
which
those
diversely
imbued
with
his
spirit
are
grouped
into
a
hierarchy
a
church
of
this
kind
is
the
outer
reality
of
the
logos
and
the
power
which
lives
in
it
lived
in
a
personal
way
in
the
christ
become
flesh
in
jesus
thus
the
church
is
through
jesus
united
to
god
jesus
is
its
meaning
and
one
thing
was
clear
to
all
gnosis
that
one
must
come
to
an
understanding
about
the
personality
of
jesus
christ
and
jesus
must
be
brought
into
connection
with
one
another
divinity
was
taken
away
from
human
personality
and
must
in
one
way
or
another
be
recovered
it
must
be
possible
to
find
it
again
in
jesus
the
mystic
had
to
do
with
a
degree
of
divinity
within
himself
and
with
his
earthly
personality
the
christian
had
to
do
with
the
latter
and
also
with
a
perfect
god
far
above
all
that
is
attainable
by
humanity
if
we
hold
firmly
to
this
point
of
view
a
fundamental
mystic
attitude
of
the
soul
is
only
possible
when
the
soul
spiritual
eyes
are
opened
when
through
finding
higher
spiritual
possibilities
within
itself
the
soul
throws
itself
open
to
the
light
which
issues
from
christ
in
jesus
the
union
of
the
soul
with
its
highest
powers
is
at
the
same
time
union
with
the
historical
christ
for
mysticism
is
an
immediate
consciousness
and
feeling
of
the
divine
within
the
soul
but
a
god
far
transcending
everything
human
can
never
dwell
in
the
soul
in
the
real
sense
of
the
word
the
gnosis
and
all
subsequent
christian
mysticism
represent
the
effort
in
some
way
or
other
to
lay
hold
of
that
god
and
to
apprehend
him
directly
in
the
soul
a
conflict
in
this
case
was
inevitable
it
was
really
only
possible
for
a
man
to
find
his
own
divine
part
but
this
is
both
human
and
divine
the
divine
at
a
certain
stage
of
development
yet
the
christian
god
is
a
definite
one
perfect
in
himself
it
was
possible
for
a
person
to
find
in
himself
the
power
to
strive
upwards
to
this
god
but
he
could
not
say
that
what
he
experienced
in
his
own
soul
at
any
stage
of
development
was
one
with
god
a
great
gulf
was
fixed
between
what
it
was
possible
to
find
in
the
soul
and
what
christianity
called
divine
it
is
the
gulf
between
science
and
faith
between
knowledge
and
religious
feeling
this
gulf
does
not
exist
for
the
mystic
in
the
old
sense
of
the
word
for
he
knows
for
a
certainty
that
he
can
only
comprehend
the
divine
by
degrees
and
he
also
knows
why
this
is
so
it
is
clear
to
him
that
this
gradual
attainment
is
a
real
attainment
of
real
divine
life
and
he
finds
it
difficult
to
speak
of
a
perfect
isolated
divine
principle
a
mystic
of
this
kind
does
not
seek
a
perfect
god
but
he
wishes
to
experience
the
divine
life
he
seeks
to
be
made
divine
not
to
gain
an
external
relation
to
the
godhead
it
is
of
the
essence
of
christianity
that
its
mysticism
in
this
sense
starts
with
an
assumption
the
christian
mystic
seeks
to
behold
divinity
within
him
but
at
the
same
time
he
looks
up
to
the
historical
christ
as
his
physical
eyes
do
to
the
sun
just
as
the
sun
is
the
means
by
which
physical
eyes
behold
physical
objects
so
does
the
christian
mystic
intensify
his
inner
nature
that
it
may
behold
the
divine
and
the
light
which
makes
such
vision
possible
for
him
is
the
fact
of
the
appearance
of
christ
it
is
he
who
enables
man
to
attain
his
highest
possibilities
it
is
in
this
way
that
the
christian
mystics
of
the
middle
ages
differ
from
the
mystics
of
the
ancient
mysteries
my
book
of
the
xii
christianity
and
heathen
wisdom
at
the
time
of
the
first
beginnings
of
christianity
there
appear
in
heathen
civilisation
conceptions
of
the
universe
which
seem
to
be
a
continuation
of
the
platonic
philosophy
and
which
may
also
be
taken
as
a
deepening
and
spiritualisation
of
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
the
beginning
of
such
conceptions
is
to
be
dated
from
philo
of
alexandria
from
his
point
of
view
the
processes
which
lead
to
the
divine
take
place
in
the
innermost
part
of
the
human
soul
we
might
say
that
the
temple
in
which
philo
seeks
initiation
is
wholly
within
him
and
his
higher
experiences
are
the
mysteries
in
his
case
processes
of
a
purely
spiritual
nature
replace
the
initiatory
ceremonies
of
the
sanctuary
according
to
philo
and
knowledge
gained
through
the
logical
intellect
do
not
lead
to
the
divine
they
have
merely
to
do
with
what
is
perishable
but
there
is
a
way
by
which
the
soul
may
rise
above
these
methods
it
must
come
out
of
what
it
calls
its
ordinary
self
from
this
it
must
withdraw
then
it
enters
a
state
of
spiritual
exaltation
and
illumination
in
which
it
no
longer
knows
thinks
and
judges
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
words
for
it
has
become
merged
identified
with
the
divine
which
is
experienced
in
its
essence
and
can
not
be
imparted
in
or
abstract
ideas
it
is
experienced
and
one
who
goes
through
this
experience
knows
that
no
one
can
impart
it
for
the
only
way
of
reaching
it
is
to
live
it
the
visible
world
is
an
image
of
this
mystic
reality
which
is
experienced
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
soul
the
world
has
come
forth
from
the
invisible
inconceivable
god
the
harmony
of
the
cosmos
which
is
steeped
in
wisdom
and
to
which
are
subject
is
a
direct
reflection
of
the
godhead
its
spiritual
image
it
is
divine
spirit
poured
out
into
the
world
cosmic
reason
the
logos
the
offspring
or
son
of
god
the
logos
is
the
mediator
between
the
world
of
sense
and
the
unimaginable
god
when
man
steeps
himself
in
knowledge
he
becomes
united
with
the
logos
which
is
embodied
in
him
the
person
who
has
developed
spirituality
is
the
vehicle
of
the
logos
above
the
logos
is
god
beneath
is
the
perishable
world
it
is
vocation
to
form
the
link
between
the
two
what
he
experiences
in
his
inmost
being
as
spirit
is
the
universal
spirit
such
ideas
are
directly
reminiscent
of
the
pythagorean
manner
of
thinking
the
centre
of
existence
is
sought
in
the
inner
life
but
this
life
is
conscious
of
its
cosmic
value
augustine
was
thinking
in
virtually
the
same
way
as
philo
when
he
said
we
see
all
created
things
because
they
are
but
they
are
because
god
sees
them
and
he
adds
concerning
what
and
how
we
see
and
because
they
are
we
see
them
outwardly
because
they
are
perfect
we
see
them
inwardly
plato
has
the
same
fundamental
idea
like
plato
philo
sees
in
the
destiny
of
the
human
soul
the
closing
act
of
the
great
cosmic
drama
the
awakening
of
the
divinity
that
is
under
a
spell
he
thus
describes
the
inner
actions
of
the
soul
the
wisdom
in
man
inner
being
walks
along
tracing
the
paths
of
the
father
and
shapes
the
forms
while
beholding
the
archetypes
it
is
no
personal
matter
for
man
to
create
forms
in
his
inner
being
they
are
the
eternal
wisdom
they
are
the
cosmic
life
this
is
in
harmony
with
the
interpretation
of
the
myths
of
the
people
in
the
light
of
the
mysteries
the
mystic
searches
for
the
deeper
truth
in
the
myths
and
as
the
mystic
treats
the
myths
of
paganism
philo
handles
moses
story
of
the
creation
the
old
testament
accounts
are
for
him
images
of
inner
the
bible
relates
the
creation
of
the
world
one
who
merely
takes
it
as
a
description
of
outer
events
only
half
knows
it
it
is
certainly
written
in
the
beginning
god
created
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
earth
was
without
form
and
void
and
darkness
was
on
the
face
of
the
deep
and
the
spirit
of
god
moved
on
the
face
of
the
waters
but
the
real
inner
meaning
of
the
words
must
be
lived
in
the
depths
of
the
soul
god
must
be
found
within
then
he
appears
as
the
primal
splendour
who
sends
out
innumerable
rays
not
perceptible
by
the
senses
but
collectively
thinkable
this
is
philo
expression
in
the
of
plato
the
words
are
almost
identical
with
the
bible
ones
now
when
the
father
who
had
created
the
universe
saw
how
it
had
become
living
and
animated
and
an
image
of
the
eternal
gods
he
felt
pleasure
therein
in
the
bible
we
read
and
god
saw
that
it
was
good
the
recognition
of
the
divine
is
for
philo
as
well
as
for
plato
and
in
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
to
live
through
the
process
of
creation
in
one
own
soul
the
history
of
creation
and
the
history
of
the
soul
which
is
becoming
divine
in
this
way
flow
into
one
philo
is
convinced
that
moses
account
of
the
creation
may
be
used
for
writing
the
history
of
the
soul
which
is
seeking
god
everything
in
the
bible
thereby
acquires
a
profoundly
symbolical
meaning
of
which
philo
becomes
the
interpreter
he
reads
the
bible
as
a
history
of
the
soul
we
may
say
that
philo
manner
of
reading
the
bible
corresponds
to
a
feature
of
his
age
which
originated
in
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
he
indeed
relates
that
the
therapeutæ
interpreted
ancient
writings
in
the
same
way
they
also
possess
works
by
ancient
authors
who
once
directed
their
school
and
left
behind
many
explanations
about
the
customary
method
pursued
in
allegorical
writings
the
interpretation
of
such
writings
is
directed
to
the
deeper
meaning
of
the
allegorical
narratives
thus
philo
aim
was
to
discover
the
deeper
meaning
of
the
allegorical
narratives
in
the
old
testament
let
us
try
to
realise
whither
such
an
interpretation
could
lead
we
read
the
account
of
creation
and
find
in
it
not
only
a
narrative
of
outward
events
but
an
indication
of
the
way
which
the
soul
has
to
take
in
order
to
attain
to
the
divine
thus
the
soul
must
reproduce
in
itself
as
a
microcosm
the
ways
of
god
and
in
this
alone
can
its
efforts
after
wisdom
consist
the
drama
of
the
universe
must
be
enacted
in
each
individual
soul
the
inner
life
of
the
mystical
sage
is
the
realisation
of
the
image
given
in
the
account
of
creation
moses
wrote
not
only
to
relate
historical
facts
but
to
represent
pictorially
the
paths
which
the
soul
must
travel
if
it
would
find
god
all
this
in
philo
conception
of
the
universe
is
enacted
within
the
human
soul
man
experiences
within
himself
what
god
has
experienced
in
the
universe
the
word
of
god
the
logos
becomes
an
event
in
the
soul
god
brought
the
jews
from
egypt
into
palestine
he
let
them
go
through
distress
and
privation
before
giving
them
that
land
of
promise
that
is
the
outward
event
man
must
experience
it
inwardly
he
goes
from
the
land
of
egypt
the
perishable
world
through
the
privations
which
lead
to
the
suppression
of
the
into
the
promised
land
of
the
soul
he
attains
the
eternal
with
philo
it
is
all
an
inward
process
the
god
who
poured
himself
forth
into
the
world
consummates
his
resurrection
in
the
soul
when
that
soul
understands
his
creative
word
and
echoes
it
then
man
has
spiritually
given
birth
within
himself
to
divinity
to
the
divine
spirit
which
became
man
to
the
logos
christ
in
this
sense
knowledge
was
for
philo
and
those
who
thought
like
him
the
birth
of
christ
within
the
world
of
spirit
the
philosophy
which
developed
contemporaneously
with
christianity
was
an
elaboration
of
philo
thought
let
us
see
how
plotinus
describes
his
spiritual
experiences
often
when
i
come
to
myself
on
awaking
from
bodily
sleep
and
turning
from
the
outer
world
enter
into
myself
i
behold
wondrous
beauty
then
i
am
sure
that
i
have
been
conscious
of
the
better
part
of
myself
i
live
my
true
life
i
am
one
with
the
divine
and
rooted
in
the
divine
gain
the
power
to
transport
myself
beyond
even
the
after
thus
resting
in
god
when
i
descend
from
spiritual
vision
and
again
form
thoughts
i
ask
myself
how
it
has
happened
that
i
now
descend
and
that
my
soul
ever
entered
the
body
at
all
since
in
its
essence
it
is
what
it
has
just
revealed
itself
to
me
what
can
the
reason
be
for
souls
forgetting
god
the
father
since
they
come
from
the
beyond
and
belong
to
him
and
when
they
forget
him
know
nothing
of
him
or
of
themselves
the
first
false
step
they
take
is
indulging
in
presumption
the
desire
to
become
and
in
forgetfulness
of
their
true
self
and
in
the
pleasure
of
only
belonging
to
themselves
they
coveted
they
rushed
about
in
pursuit
of
their
desires
and
thus
went
astray
and
fell
completely
away
thereupon
they
lost
all
knowledge
of
their
origin
in
the
beyond
just
as
children
early
separated
from
their
parents
and
brought
up
elsewhere
do
not
know
who
they
themselves
and
their
parents
are
plotinus
delineates
the
kind
of
life
which
the
soul
should
strive
to
develop
the
life
of
the
body
and
its
longings
should
be
stilled
the
soul
should
see
calm
in
all
that
surrounds
it
in
earth
sea
air
and
heaven
itself
no
movement
it
should
learn
to
see
how
the
soul
pours
itself
from
without
into
the
serene
cosmos
streaming
into
it
from
all
sides
as
the
sun
rays
illuminate
a
dark
cloud
and
make
it
golden
so
does
the
soul
on
entering
the
body
of
the
world
encircled
by
the
sky
give
it
life
and
immortality
it
is
evident
that
this
vision
of
the
world
is
very
similar
to
that
of
christianity
believers
of
the
community
of
jesus
said
that
which
was
from
the
beginning
which
we
have
heard
which
we
have
seen
with
our
eyes
which
we
have
looked
upon
and
our
hands
have
handled
of
the
word
of
life
declare
we
unto
you
in
the
same
way
it
might
be
said
in
the
spirit
of
that
which
was
from
the
beginning
which
can
not
be
heard
and
seen
must
be
spiritually
experienced
as
the
word
of
life
and
so
the
old
conception
of
the
universe
is
developed
and
splits
into
two
leading
ideas
it
leads
in
and
similar
systems
to
an
idea
of
christ
which
is
purely
spiritual
on
the
other
hand
it
leads
to
a
fusion
of
the
idea
of
christ
with
a
historical
manifestation
the
personality
of
jesus
the
writer
of
the
gospel
of
john
may
be
said
to
unite
these
two
conceptions
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
he
shares
this
conviction
with
the
the
word
becomes
spirit
within
the
soul
thus
do
the
conclude
the
word
was
made
flesh
in
jesus
thus
does
john
conclude
and
with
him
the
whole
christian
community
the
inner
meaning
of
the
manner
in
which
the
word
was
made
flesh
was
given
in
all
the
ancient
cosmogonies
plato
says
of
the
macrocosm
god
has
extended
the
body
of
the
world
on
the
soul
of
the
world
in
the
form
of
a
cross
the
soul
of
the
world
is
the
logos
if
the
logos
is
to
be
made
flesh
he
must
recapitulate
the
cosmic
process
in
fleshly
existence
he
must
be
nailed
to
the
cross
and
rise
again
in
spiritual
form
this
most
momentous
thought
of
christianity
had
long
before
been
prefigured
in
the
old
cosmogonies
the
mystic
went
through
it
as
a
personal
experience
in
initiation
the
logos
become
man
had
to
go
through
it
in
a
way
that
made
this
fact
one
that
is
true
for
or
valid
to
the
whole
of
humanity
something
which
was
present
under
the
old
dispensation
as
an
incident
in
the
mysteries
becomes
a
historical
fact
through
christianity
hence
christianity
was
the
fulfilment
not
only
of
what
the
jewish
prophets
had
predicted
but
also
of
the
truth
which
had
been
prefigured
in
the
mysteries
the
cross
of
golgotha
gathers
together
in
one
fact
the
whole
cult
of
the
mysteries
of
antiquity
we
find
the
cross
first
in
the
ancient
cosmogonies
at
the
of
christianity
it
confronts
us
in
an
unique
event
which
has
supreme
value
for
the
whole
of
mankind
it
is
from
this
point
of
view
that
it
is
possible
for
the
reason
to
apprehend
the
mystical
element
in
christianity
christianity
as
a
mystical
fact
is
a
milestone
in
the
process
of
human
evolution
and
the
incidents
in
the
mysteries
with
their
attendant
results
are
the
preparation
for
that
mystical
fact
xiii
augustine
and
the
church
the
full
force
of
the
conflict
which
was
enacted
in
the
souls
of
christian
believers
during
the
transition
from
paganism
to
the
new
religion
is
exhibited
in
the
person
of
augustine
the
spiritual
struggles
of
origen
clement
of
alexandria
gregory
nazianzen
jerome
and
others
are
full
of
mysterious
interest
when
we
see
them
calmed
and
laid
to
rest
in
the
mind
of
augustine
in
augustine
personality
deep
spiritual
needs
developed
out
of
a
passionate
nature
he
passed
through
pagan
and
ideas
he
suffered
deeply
from
the
most
appalling
doubts
of
the
land
which
attack
one
who
has
felt
the
impotence
of
many
varieties
of
thought
in
the
face
of
spiritual
problems
and
who
has
tasted
the
depressing
effect
of
the
question
can
man
know
anything
whatever
at
the
beginning
of
his
struggles
augustine
thoughts
clung
to
the
perishable
things
of
sense
he
could
only
picture
the
spiritual
to
himself
in
material
images
it
is
a
deliverance
for
him
when
he
rises
above
this
stage
he
thus
describes
it
in
his
when
i
wished
to
think
of
god
i
could
only
imagine
immense
masses
of
bodies
and
believed
that
was
the
only
kind
of
thing
that
could
exist
this
was
the
chief
and
almost
the
only
cause
of
the
errors
which
i
could
not
avoid
he
thus
indicates
the
point
at
which
a
person
must
arrive
who
is
seeking
the
true
life
of
the
spirit
there
are
thinkers
not
a
few
who
maintain
that
it
is
impossible
to
arrive
at
pure
thought
free
from
any
material
admixture
these
thinkers
confuse
what
they
feel
bound
to
say
about
their
own
inner
life
with
what
is
humanly
possible
the
truth
rather
is
that
it
is
only
possible
to
arrive
at
higher
knowledge
when
thought
has
been
liberated
from
all
material
things
when
an
inner
life
has
been
developed
in
which
images
of
reality
do
not
cease
when
their
demonstration
in
comes
to
an
end
augustine
relates
how
he
attained
to
spiritual
vision
everywhere
he
asked
where
the
divine
was
to
be
found
i
asked
the
earth
and
she
said
am
not
it
and
all
that
was
upon
the
earth
said
the
same
i
asked
the
ocean
and
the
abysses
and
all
that
lives
in
them
which
said
are
not
thy
god
seek
beyond
us
i
asked
the
winds
and
the
whole
atmosphere
and
its
inhabitants
said
philosophers
who
sought
for
the
essence
of
things
in
us
were
under
an
illusion
we
are
not
god
i
asked
the
sun
moon
and
stars
which
said
are
not
god
whom
thou
seekest
and
it
came
home
to
augustine
that
there
is
only
one
thing
which
can
answer
his
question
about
the
divine
his
own
soul
the
soul
said
no
eyes
nor
ears
can
impart
to
thee
what
is
in
me
for
i
alone
can
tell
thee
and
i
tell
thee
in
an
unquestionable
way
men
may
be
doubtful
whether
vital
force
is
situate
in
air
or
in
fire
but
who
can
doubt
that
he
himself
lives
remembers
understands
wills
thinks
knows
and
judges
if
he
doubts
it
is
a
proof
that
he
is
alive
he
remembers
why
he
doubts
he
understands
that
he
doubts
he
will
assure
himself
of
things
he
thinks
he
knows
that
he
knows
nothing
he
judges
that
he
must
not
accept
anything
hastily
outer
things
do
not
defend
themselves
when
their
essence
and
existence
are
denied
but
the
soul
does
defend
itself
it
could
not
be
doubtful
of
itself
unless
it
existed
by
its
doubt
it
confirms
its
own
existence
we
are
and
we
recognise
our
being
and
we
love
our
own
being
and
knowledge
on
these
three
points
no
illusion
in
the
garb
of
truth
can
trouble
us
for
we
do
not
apprehend
them
with
our
bodily
senses
like
external
things
man
learns
about
the
divine
by
leading
his
soul
to
know
itself
as
spiritual
so
that
it
may
find
its
way
as
a
spirit
into
the
spiritual
world
augustine
had
battled
his
way
through
to
this
knowledge
it
was
out
of
such
an
attitude
of
mind
that
there
grew
up
in
pagan
nations
the
desire
to
knock
at
the
gate
of
the
mysteries
in
the
age
of
augustine
such
convictions
might
lead
to
becoming
a
christian
jesus
the
logos
become
man
had
shown
the
path
which
must
be
followed
by
the
soul
if
it
would
attain
the
goal
which
it
sees
when
in
communion
with
itself
in
at
milan
augustine
was
instructed
by
ambrose
all
his
doubts
about
the
old
and
new
testaments
vanished
when
his
teacher
interpreted
the
most
important
passages
not
merely
in
a
literal
sense
but
by
lifting
the
mystic
veil
by
force
of
the
spirit
what
had
been
guarded
in
the
mysteries
was
embodied
for
augustine
in
the
historical
tradition
of
the
evangelists
and
in
the
community
where
that
tradition
was
preserved
he
comes
by
degrees
to
the
conviction
that
the
law
of
this
tradition
which
consists
in
believing
what
it
has
not
proved
is
moderate
and
without
guile
he
arrives
at
the
idea
who
could
be
so
blind
as
to
say
that
the
church
of
the
apostles
deserves
to
have
no
faith
placed
in
it
when
it
is
so
loyal
and
is
supported
by
the
conformity
of
so
many
brethren
when
these
have
handed
down
their
writings
to
posterity
so
conscientiously
and
when
the
church
has
so
strictly
maintained
the
succession
of
teachers
down
to
our
present
bishops
augustine
mode
of
thought
told
him
that
with
the
coming
of
christ
other
conditions
had
set
in
for
souls
seeking
after
the
spirit
than
those
which
had
previously
existed
for
him
it
was
firmly
established
that
in
christ
jesus
had
been
revealed
in
outer
historical
fact
that
which
the
mystic
had
sought
in
the
mysteries
through
preparation
one
of
his
most
significant
utterances
is
the
following
what
is
now
called
the
christian
religion
already
existed
amongst
the
ancients
and
was
not
lacking
at
the
very
beginnings
of
the
human
race
when
christ
appeared
in
the
flesh
the
true
religion
already
in
existence
received
the
name
of
christian
there
were
two
ways
possible
for
such
a
method
of
thought
one
way
is
that
if
the
human
soul
develops
within
it
the
forces
which
lead
it
to
the
knowledge
of
its
true
self
it
will
if
it
only
goes
far
enough
come
also
to
the
knowledge
of
the
christ
and
of
everything
connected
with
him
this
would
have
been
a
enriched
through
the
christ
event
the
other
way
is
taken
by
augustine
and
is
that
by
which
he
became
the
great
model
for
his
successors
it
consists
in
cutting
off
the
development
of
the
forces
of
the
soul
at
a
certain
point
and
in
borrowing
the
ideas
connected
with
the
coming
of
christ
from
written
accounts
and
oral
traditions
augustine
rejected
the
first
way
as
springing
from
pride
of
the
soul
he
thought
the
second
was
the
way
of
true
humility
thus
he
says
to
those
who
wished
to
follow
the
first
way
you
may
find
peace
in
the
truth
but
for
that
humility
is
needed
which
does
not
suit
your
proud
neck
on
the
other
hand
he
was
filled
with
boundless
inward
happiness
by
the
fact
that
since
the
coming
of
christ
in
the
flesh
it
was
possible
to
say
that
every
soul
can
come
to
spiritual
experience
which
goes
as
far
as
it
can
in
seeking
within
itself
and
then
in
order
to
attain
to
the
highest
has
confidence
in
what
the
written
and
oral
traditions
of
the
christian
church
tell
us
about
the
christ
and
his
revelation
he
says
on
this
point
what
bliss
what
abiding
enjoyment
of
supreme
and
true
good
is
offered
us
what
serenity
what
a
breath
of
eternity
how
shall
i
describe
it
it
has
been
expressed
as
far
as
it
could
be
by
those
great
incomparable
souls
who
we
admit
have
beheld
and
still
behold
we
reach
a
point
at
which
we
acknowledge
how
true
is
what
we
have
been
commanded
to
believe
and
how
well
and
beneficently
we
have
been
brought
up
by
our
mother
the
church
and
of
what
benefit
was
the
milk
given
by
the
apostle
paul
to
the
little
ones
it
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
book
to
give
an
account
of
the
alternative
method
which
is
evolved
from
the
mystery
wisdom
enriched
through
the
christ
event
the
description
of
this
method
will
be
found
in
outline
of
occult
see
front
page
whereas
in
times
one
who
wished
to
seek
the
spiritual
basis
of
existence
was
necessarily
directed
to
the
way
of
the
mysteries
augustine
was
able
to
say
even
to
those
souls
who
could
find
no
such
path
within
themselves
go
as
far
as
you
can
on
the
path
of
knowledge
with
your
human
powers
thence
trust
faith
will
carry
you
up
into
the
higher
spiritual
regions
it
was
only
going
one
step
further
to
say
it
is
natural
to
the
human
soul
only
to
be
able
to
arrive
at
a
certain
stage
of
knowledge
through
its
own
powers
thence
it
can
only
advance
further
through
trust
through
faith
in
written
and
oral
tradition
this
step
was
taken
by
the
spiritual
movement
which
assigned
to
knowledge
a
certain
sphere
above
which
the
soul
could
not
rise
by
its
own
efforts
but
everything
which
lay
beyond
this
domain
was
made
an
object
of
faith
which
has
to
be
supported
by
written
and
oral
tradition
and
by
confidence
in
its
representatives
thomas
aquinas
the
greatest
teacher
within
the
church
has
set
forth
this
doctrine
in
his
writings
in
a
variety
of
ways
his
main
point
is
that
human
knowledge
can
only
attain
to
that
which
led
augustine
to
to
the
certainty
of
the
divine
the
nature
of
the
divine
and
its
relation
to
the
world
is
given
by
revealed
theology
which
is
not
accessible
to
man
own
researches
and
is
as
the
substance
of
faith
superior
to
all
knowledge
the
origin
of
this
point
of
view
may
be
studied
in
the
theology
of
john
scotus
erigena
who
lived
in
the
ninth
century
at
the
court
of
charles
the
bald
and
who
represents
a
natural
transition
from
the
earliest
ideas
of
christianity
to
the
ideas
of
thomas
aquinas
his
conception
of
the
universe
is
couched
in
the
spirit
of
in
his
treatise
divisione
erigena
has
elaborated
the
teaching
of
dionysius
the
areopagite
this
teaching
started
from
a
god
far
above
the
perishable
things
of
sense
and
it
derived
the
world
from
him
man
is
involved
in
the
transmutation
of
all
beings
into
this
god
who
finally
becomes
what
he
was
from
the
beginning
everything
falls
back
again
into
the
godhead
which
has
passed
through
the
universal
process
and
has
finally
become
perfected
but
in
order
to
reach
this
goal
man
must
find
the
way
to
the
logos
who
was
made
flesh
in
erigena
this
thought
leads
to
another
that
what
is
contained
in
the
writings
which
give
an
account
of
the
logos
leads
when
received
in
faith
to
salvation
reason
and
the
authority
of
the
scriptures
faith
and
knowledge
stand
on
the
same
level
the
one
does
not
contradict
the
other
but
faith
must
bring
that
to
which
knowledge
never
can
attain
by
itself
the
knowledge
of
the
eternal
which
the
ancient
mysteries
withheld
from
the
multitude
became
when
presented
in
this
way
by
christian
thought
and
feeling
the
content
of
faith
which
by
its
very
nature
had
to
do
with
something
unattainable
by
mere
knowledge
the
conviction
of
the
mystic
was
that
to
him
was
given
knowledge
of
the
divine
while
the
people
were
obliged
to
have
faith
in
its
expression
in
images
christianity
came
to
the
conviction
that
god
has
given
his
wisdom
to
mankind
through
revelation
and
man
attains
through
his
knowledge
an
image
of
this
divine
revelation
the
wisdom
of
the
mysteries
is
a
hothouse
plant
which
is
revealed
to
a
few
individuals
ripe
for
it
christian
wisdom
is
a
mystery
revealed
as
knowledge
to
none
but
as
a
content
of
faith
revealed
to
all
the
standpoint
of
the
mysteries
lived
on
in
christianity
but
in
a
different
form
all
not
only
the
special
individual
were
to
share
in
the
truth
but
the
process
was
that
at
a
certain
point
man
owned
his
inability
to
penetrate
farther
by
means
of
knowledge
and
thence
ascended
to
faith
christianity
brought
the
content
of
the
mysteries
out
of
the
obscurity
of
the
temple
into
the
clear
light
of
day
the
one
christian
movement
mentioned
led
to
the
idea
that
this
content
must
necessarily
be
retained
in
the
form
of
faith
notes
to
one
who
has
true
perception
the
spirit
of
nature
speaks
powerfully
in
the
facts
currently
expressed
by
the
catchword
struggle
for
existence
etc
but
not
in
the
opinions
which
modern
science
deduces
from
them
in
the
first
statement
lies
the
reason
why
natural
science
is
attracting
more
and
more
widespread
attention
but
it
follows
from
the
second
statement
that
scientific
opinions
should
not
be
taken
as
if
they
necessarily
belonged
to
a
knowledge
of
facts
the
possibility
of
being
led
astray
by
mere
opinion
is
in
these
days
infinitely
great
it
should
not
be
concluded
from
these
remarks
about
the
sources
of
luke
gospel
that
purely
historical
research
is
undervalued
by
the
writer
of
this
book
this
is
not
the
case
historical
research
is
absolutely
justified
but
it
should
not
be
impatient
with
the
method
of
presentation
proceeding
from
a
spiritual
point
of
view
it
is
not
considered
of
importance
to
make
various
kinds
of
quotations
in
this
book
but
one
who
is
willing
will
be
able
to
see
that
a
really
unprejudiced
judgment
will
not
find
anything
that
is
here
stated
to
be
contrary
to
what
has
been
actually
and
historically
proved
one
who
will
not
be
but
who
holds
this
or
that
theory
to
be
a
fact
may
easily
think
that
assertions
made
in
this
book
are
untenable
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
and
are
made
without
any
objective
foundation
it
is
said
above
that
those
whose
spiritual
eyes
are
opened
are
able
to
see
into
the
spiritual
world
the
conclusion
must
not
on
this
account
be
drawn
that
only
one
who
possesses
spiritual
sight
is
able
to
form
an
intelligent
opinion
about
the
results
arrived
at
by
the
initiate
spiritual
sight
belongs
only
to
the
investigator
if
he
afterwards
communicates
what
he
has
discovered
every
one
can
understand
it
who
gives
fair
play
to
his
reason
and
preserves
an
unbiassed
sense
of
truth
and
such
an
one
may
also
apply
the
results
of
research
to
life
and
derive
satisfaction
from
them
without
himself
having
spiritual
sight
the
sinking
into
the
mire
spoken
of
by
plato
must
also
be
interpreted
in
the
sense
referred
to
in
the
last
note
what
is
said
about
the
impossibility
of
imparting
the
teaching
of
the
mysteries
has
reference
to
the
fact
that
they
could
not
be
communicated
to
those
unprepared
in
the
same
form
in
which
the
initiate
experienced
them
but
they
were
always
communicated
to
those
outside
in
such
a
form
as
was
possible
for
the
uninitiated
to
understand
for
instance
the
myths
gave
the
old
form
in
order
to
communicate
the
content
of
the
mysteries
in
a
way
that
was
generally
comprehensible
everything
that
relates
to
knowledge
gained
through
the
eyes
of
the
spirit

called

ancient
mysticism
mantik
telestik

the
other
hand

the
indication
of
the
ways
which

to
ancient
mysticism

with
a

far
above
the
human
consciousness

schelling

ascends
to
a
state
of
