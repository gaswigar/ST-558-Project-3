history
canadian
canoes
are
the
only
boats
that
will
do
was
our
conclusion
after
a
thorough
inspection
of
every
existing
species
of
boat
and
long
consultation
with
sambo
of
eton
about
a
totally
new
variety
invented
but
fortunately
patented
by
one
of
our
number
our
party
consisted
of
three
men
who
shall
be
briefly
described
here
first
the
skipper
so
called
from
his
varied
experience
by
land
and
sea
in
all
parts
of
the
world
but
especially
in
norway
whither
we
were
now
intending
to
go
in
search
of
trout
reindeer
and
the
picturesque
the
skipper
is
lank
and
thin
looking
as
though
he
had
outgrown
his
strength
in
boyhood
and
never
summoned
up
pluck
enough
to
recover
it
again
his
high
and
troubled
expression
give
one
the
idea
of
a
man
who
can
not
convince
himself
that
life
is
a
success
which
is
perhaps
pretty
nearly
the
view
he
actually
takes
of
existence
secondly
esau
who
received
this
name
in
consequence
of
the
many
points
in
which
his
character
and
history
resemble
that
of
the
patriarch
who
first
rejoiced
in
it
for
our
esau
like
his
prototype
is
a
cunning
hunter
and
man
of
the
fjeld
and
we
are
sure
that
if
he
ever
had
such
a
thing
as
a
birthright
he
would
willingly
have
sold
it
for
a
mess
of
pottage
esau
is
short
and
joyous
and
is
one
of
those
people
who
never
indigest
anything
but
always
look
and
always
are
in
perfect
health
and
spirits
it
is
annoying
to
see
a
man
eat
things
that
his
can
not
without
suffering
for
it
afterwards
but
esau
invariably
does
this
at
dinner
and
comes
down
to
breakfast
next
morning
with
a
provoking
colour
on
his
cheek
and
a
hearty
appetite
his
office
in
this
expedition
was
that
of
paymaster
not
because
he
possessed
any
qualifications
for
the
post
but
because
the
skipper
had
conclusively
proved
that
such
employment
was
too
gross
and
mundane
for
ethereal
soul
by
constantly
leaving
the
purse
which
contained
our
united
worldly
wealth
on
any
spot
where
he
chanced
to
rest
himself
when
he
and
esau
went
to
spy
out
the
land
two
years
before
this
lastly
john
so
called
for
no
better
reason
than
the
fact
that
he
had
been
christened
charles
he
had
never
yet
visited
the
wilds
of
scandinavia
john
is
an
irishman
whose
motto
in
life
is
dum
vivimus
vivamus
he
is
tall
and
straight
with
a
colossal
light
moustache
he
generally
wears
his
hat
slightly
tilted
forward
over
his
forehead
when
engaged
in
conversation
and
the
set
of
his
clothes
and
whole
deportment
convey
an
idea
that
he
is
longing
to
tell
you
the
most
amusing
story
in
the
world
in
confidence
he
is
no
gossip
and
the
anecdotes
of
his
countrymen
of
which
he
has
an
inexhaustible
supply
always
ready
are
merely
imparted
to
his
listeners
from
philanthropic
motives
and
because
he
longs
for
others
to
share
in
the
enjoyment
which
he
gleans
from
their
mental
dissection
the
general
idea
of
the
campaign
was
that
the
skipper
and
esau
should
leave
england
in
the
early
part
of
july
fish
their
way
up
a
string
of
lakes
into
the
jotunfjeld
getting
there
in
time
for
the
commencement
of
the
reindeer
season
establish
a
camp
somewhere
and
then
that
john
starting
a
month
later
should
join
and
the
three
of
us
sojourn
in
that
land
until
we
were
tired
thereof
how
we
accomplished
this
meritorious
design
we
have
tried
to
relate
in
the
following
pages
geography
the
map
of
norway
apart
from
sweden
presents
an
outline
something
like
a
tadpole
with
a
crooked
irregular
tail
the
jotunfjeld
is
an
extensive
range
of
the
highest
mountains
which
are
to
be
found
in
northern
europe
before
they
were
totally
unexplored
and
at
the
present
time
they
are
still
perfectly
wild
and
desolate
their
summits
covered
with
eternal
ice
and
snow
and
even
their
valleys
uninhabited
that
part
of
the
jotunfjeld
which
we
intended
to
make
our
goal
and
headquarters
is
situated
about
the
middle
of
the
tadpole
s
body
and
nearly
equidistant
from
throndhjem
and
christiania
languages
it
is
customary
when
writing
a
book
on
any
foreign
country
to
scatter
broadcast
in
your
descriptions
words
and
phrases
in
the
language
of
that
country
in
order
to
show
that
you
really
have
been
there
we
propose
to
depart
from
this
usage
in
the
course
of
this
work
but
if
at
any
time
the
exigencies
of
narrative
seem
to
demand
the
use
of
the
foreign
tongue
we
have
little
doubt
that
the
english
language
will
provide
an
equivalent
which
shall
be
inserted
for
the
benefit
of
the
uninitiated
mathematics
foreigners
have
a
curious
prejudice
which
leads
them
to
adopt
different
systems
of
coinage
and
measurement
from
those
in
favour
in
england
but
shall
a
briton
pander
to
this
prejudice
by
making
any
use
of
their
ridiculous
figures
decidedly
not
what
matters
it
to
us
that
a
norwegian
contains
seven
of
our
miles
and
a
four
we
speak
only
of
the
british
mile
what
care
we
that
the
norwegian
kröne
is
worth
about
shall
that
prevent
us
from
always
calling
it
a
shilling
never
and
shall
the
fact
that
it
is
divided
into
ten
pieces
which
are
little
nickel
coins
worth
about
five
farthings
each
restrain
us
from
alluding
to
them
as
the
threepenny
bits
which
they
so
much
resemble
not
while
life
remains
extra
subjects
some
of
the
statements
that
will
be
found
in
these
pages
may
strike
the
reader
as
being
to
say
the
least
of
it
improbable
we
therefore
wish
to
explain
that
all
the
incidents
of
sport
and
travel
are
simple
facts
but
that
here
and
there
is
introduced
some
slight
fiction
which
is
too
obviously
exaggerated
to
require
any
comment
three
in
norway
chapter
i
the
voyage
at
ten
on
the
platform
of
the
hull
station
might
have
been
seen
the
disconsolate
form
of
esau
who
had
arrived
there
a
few
minutes
before
to
him
entered
suddenly
an
express
train
with
that
haste
which
seems
to
be
inseparable
from
the
movements
of
express
trains
adorned
as
to
the
roof
of
one
of
its
carriages
by
a
canadian
canoe
from
that
carriage
emerged
the
lanky
body
of
the
skipper
and
general
joy
ensued
then
in
the
hotel
the
skipper
related
his
perilous
adventures
how
he
had
crossed
london
in
a
with
the
canoe
on
the
and
himself
surrounded
by
rods
guns
rugs
tents
and
in
the
hold
amid
the
shouts
of
boat
ahoy
from
the
volatile
populace
and
jeers
from
all
the
cabs
that
they
met
there
are
many
cabs
in
london
how
the
at
king
s
cross
may
his
shadow
never
be
less
had
personally
superintended
the
packing
of
the
canoe
on
a
low
carriage
which
he
put
on
to
the
train
specially
and
how
the
charged
four
times
as
much
as
the
he
had
seen
john
the
day
before
and
on
being
asked
to
wander
about
and
get
some
things
with
him
the
skipper
had
replied
that
it
was
quite
impossible
as
his
time
was
occupied
for
the
whole
day
but
when
john
said
i
wanted
your
advice
chiefly
about
flies
and
a
new
rod
that
i
am
thinking
of
buying
he
replied
sir
i
have
nothing
of
the
slightest
importance
to
do
my
time
is
yours
name
the
moment
and
place
of
meeting
and
i
will
be
then
they
twain
had
spent
a
happy
day
for
decidedly
the
next
best
thing
to
using
your
own
rod
is
buying
one
for
another
man
at
his
expense
poor
esau
had
no
charming
experiences
to
relate
he
was
a
little
depressed
because
an
intelligent
tyke
at
doncaster
had
looked
into
the
in
which
his
canoe
was
travelling
hoping
no
doubt
to
see
some
racer
and
had
asked
if
yon
thing
were
some
new
mak
o
a
we
walked
about
hull
and
made
a
few
last
purchases
in
the
course
of
our
wanderings
we
chanced
to
come
to
a
shop
in
the
window
of
which
many
strawberries
large
and
luscious
were
exposed
for
sale
we
immediately
entered
that
shop
without
exchanging
a
word
and
the
skipper
said
to
the
proprietress
this
gentleman
wants
to
buy
a
quantity
of
strawberries
for
a
school
feast
while
esau
remarked
as
he
fastened
on
to
the
nearest
and
largest
basket
my
friend
has
been
ordered
to
eat
strawberries
by
his
after
this
a
scene
ensued
over
which
it
were
best
to
draw
a
veil
at
six
o
clock
we
were
safely
aboard
the
good
ship
angelo
and
saw
our
baggage
stowed
it
consisted
of
three
huge
boxes
of
provisions
weighing
more
than
lbs
each
two
portmanteaus
two
smaller
bags
a
tent
a
large
intended
to
form
another
tent
a
bundle
of
rugs
and
blankets
a
large
can
containing
all
cooking
utensils
four
seven
rods
a
bundle
of
axes
a
spade
and
other
necessary
tools
and
the
canoes
with
small
wheels
for
road
transport
those
wheels
were
the
only
things
in
the
whole
outfit
that
turned
out
to
be
not
absolutely
necessary
we
did
use
them
but
only
once
and
might
have
managed
without
them
when
the
aforesaid
was
all
on
board
there
did
not
appear
to
be
much
room
for
anything
else
in
the
steamship
angelo
registering
tons
yet
this
vast
pile
was
destined
to
travel
many
miles
over
a
desperately
rough
country
in
the
two
little
canoes
we
were
warped
out
of
dock
about
eight
o
clock
and
steamed
down
the
humber
with
a
west
wind
and
a
smooth
sea
it
was
showery
up
to
the
moment
of
our
departure
but
as
hull
faded
from
our
sight
it
became
fine
and
with
the
shores
of
england
we
seemed
to
leave
the
cloud
and
rain
behind
the
day
passed
as
days
at
sea
do
when
the
weather
is
all
that
can
be
wished
and
the
treacherous
ocean
calmly
sleeps
the
passengers
were
as
sociable
as
any
collection
of
english
people
ever
are
and
we
spent
the
time
very
pleasantly
chatting
smoking
eating
enormously
and
playing
the
ordinary
sea
games
of
quoits
and
the
skipper
was
much
exercised
in
spirit
because
esau
had
told
him
that
he
believed
a
certain
passenger
to
be
an
acquaintance
of
a
former
voyage
named
let
us
say
jones
and
that
he
was
a
capital
fellow
so
the
skipper
went
and
fraternised
with
jones
and
presently
trusting
to
the
information
received
remarked
i
believe
your
name
is
jones
and
was
a
little
annoyed
when
jones
replied
no
it
s
not
jones
it
s
blueit
and
i
never
heard
the
name
of
jones
as
a
surname
then
the
skipper
arose
and
remonstrated
with
his
perfidious
friend
who
with
great
good
temper
said
to
make
it
all
right
you
see
that
man
by
the
funnel
that
is
a
yankee
going
to
see
the
midnight
sun
go
and
talk
to
now
the
skipper
has
been
in
america
a
good
deal
and
likes
to
talk
to
the
natives
of
those
regions
so
he
sailed
over
to
the
funnel
and
tackled
the
yankee
presently
with
that
admirable
tact
which
is
his
most
enviable
characteristic
he
observed
i
understand
that
you
have
come
all
the
way
from
america
to
see
the
midnight
sun
it
is
a
very
extraordinary
phenomenon
imagine
a
glorious
wealth
of
colour
glowing
over
an
eternal
sunlit
sea
and
endowing
with
a
fairy
glamour
a
scene
which
sappho
might
have
burned
to
sing
where
night
is
not
nor
sleep
but
odin
s
eye
looks
calmly
down
nor
ever
sinks
in
as
he
paused
for
breath
the
yankee
saw
his
opportunity
and
said
no
i
was
never
in
america
in
my
life
i
am
a
lincolnshire
man
and
am
going
over
to
arendahl
to
buy
timber
i
have
seen
the
midnight
sun
some
dozen
times
and
i
call
it
an
infernal
here
the
skipper
hastily
left
and
came
over
and
abused
esau
until
he
made
an
enemy
of
him
for
life
chapter
ii
christiania
july
we
reached
christiansand
about
six
and
set
sail
again
at
eight
there
was
what
the
mariners
called
a
nice
breeze
with
us
esau
declared
it
to
be
a
storm
and
was
prostrate
at
lunch
owing
as
he
said
to
attending
church
service
which
was
conducted
under
considerable
difficulties
members
of
the
congregation
occasionally
shooting
out
of
the
saloon
like
zazel
out
of
her
cannon
or
assuming
recumbent
postures
when
the
rubric
said
here
all
standing
however
we
came
along
at
a
great
pace
and
arrived
at
christiania
about
nine
at
night
after
a
passage
the
fjord
was
not
looking
as
beautiful
as
usual
as
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
rain
and
the
storm
clouds
and
mist
were
still
hovering
about
the
low
hills
so
that
no
glories
of
the
northern
sunset
were
visible
we
arranged
that
the
skipper
should
go
straight
to
the
victoria
hotel
for
rooms
as
we
heard
that
the
town
was
very
full
and
esau
was
to
follow
with
the
luggage
now
there
was
a
young
englishman
on
board
very
talkative
extremely
sociable
remarkably
and
overflowing
with
the
best
advice
he
had
gone
round
the
whole
ship
entreating
every
one
to
go
to
the
grand
as
he
intended
to
do
because
it
was
by
far
the
best
hotel
just
as
the
skipper
had
engaged
our
rooms
at
the
victoria
in
rushed
this
guileless
child
of
nature
panting
from
the
speed
at
which
he
had
come
from
the
quay
and
the
skipper
had
the
gratification
of
witnessing
his
discomfiture
and
listening
to
his
apologies
for
having
lied
unto
us
which
of
course
he
had
done
in
order
to
get
rooms
for
his
own
party
at
the
we
say
nothing
against
the
grand
because
we
know
it
not
but
any
one
who
has
once
tried
the
victoria
will
go
there
again
the
man
who
is
not
at
home
and
happy
there
must
be
a
very
young
traveller
this
hotel
possesses
a
spacious
courtyard
surrounded
by
galleries
from
which
bedrooms
and
passages
open
very
much
like
that
historical
hostelry
in
the
borough
at
which
pickwick
first
encountered
sam
weller
these
galleries
and
indeed
most
portions
of
the
hotel
are
made
of
wood
and
the
building
is
not
of
recent
date
for
now
no
houses
in
christiania
are
allowed
to
be
constructed
of
timber
only
in
the
centre
of
the
court
is
a
fountain
which
keeps
up
a
gentle
plashing
very
pleasant
to
listen
to
on
a
day
when
the
thermometer
is
at
in
the
shade
as
it
generally
is
about
this
time
of
year
in
christiania
all
round
the
fountain
are
small
tables
and
chairs
ready
for
the
little
groups
who
will
assemble
at
them
after
dinner
for
the
cup
of
coffee
and
glass
of
cognac
which
form
an
indispensable
part
of
a
norwegian
dinner
the
dinner
itself
is
during
the
summer
months
always
served
in
a
large
oblong
tent
in
the
same
courtyard
at
and
a
very
pleasant
meal
it
is
if
you
are
not
too
much
wedded
to
english
habits
to
be
able
to
secure
an
appetite
at
that
hour
at
short
intervals
down
the
table
large
blocks
of
ice
are
placed
which
perform
excellent
service
in
helping
to
keep
the
tent
cool
then
there
is
another
delightful
resort
the
which
is
upstairs
on
an
extension
of
the
gallery
overlooking
the
courtyard
it
also
is
covered
by
a
sort
of
tent
in
the
roof
of
which
divers
strange
and
gruesome
birds
and
beasts
disport
themselves
or
seem
to
do
so
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
they
are
stuffed
as
we
notice
that
the
flying
capercailzie
never
seems
to
get
any
forrader
the
fox
stealing
with
cautious
tread
upon
the
timid
hare
unaccountably
delays
his
final
spring
but
perhaps
he
is
right
not
to
hurry
for
the
hare
does
not
appear
to
be
taking
any
measures
for
her
safety
but
sits
calmly
nibbling
the
deeply
dyed
moss
which
it
were
vain
to
inform
her
is
not
good
to
eat
but
there
are
other
birds
which
we
are
stuffed
for
we
helped
to
stuff
them
and
these
are
the
sparrows
which
come
gaily
flying
in
at
the
open
side
of
the
smoking
balcony
hopping
on
the
chairs
and
tables
pecking
at
the
crumbs
on
your
plate
and
behaving
generally
in
that
peculiarly
insolent
manner
which
can
only
be
acquired
even
by
a
sparrow
after
years
of
study
and
the
most
complete
familiarity
with
the
subject
these
birds
are
a
source
of
endless
delight
to
esau
who
certainly
gives
them
more
than
can
be
good
for
them
they
eat
twice
as
much
as
the
capercailzies
though
the
latter
are
considerably
larger
and
if
the
sparrows
are
not
enough
entertainment
there
are
tanks
of
and
trees
of
unknown
species
in
pots
but
neither
of
these
perform
very
interesting
feats
in
this
room
it
is
the
custom
of
the
ordinary
traveller
to
have
his
breakfast
and
supper
breakfast
is
very
much
like
a
good
english
one
except
the
coffee
which
is
not
at
all
like
english
coffee
being
perfectly
delicious
but
the
supper
is
a
meal
peculiar
to
norway
and
is
generally
constructed
more
or
less
on
the
following
principles
caviare
with
a
fresh
lemon
cut
up
on
it
norwegian
sardines
garnished
with
parsley
and
bay
leaves
boiled
in
salt
water
prawns
of
appalling
magnitude
bologna
sausage
in
slices
chickens
slices
of
beef
tongue
and
corned
beef
reindeer
tongue
brod
lax
spelling
not
guaranteed
meaning
raw
salmon
smoked
and
cut
in
thin
slices
baked
potatoes
good
butter
and
rolls
which
no
man
can
resist
so
fresh
are
they
and
light
and
crisp
drink
salon
öl
which
is
the
best
norwegian
beer
illustration
norwegian
arrangement
of
dishes
at
table
this
supper
does
not
come
in
in
courses
but
the
whole
of
it
is
placed
on
the
table
at
once
not
spread
out
all
over
the
surface
of
the
board
as
at
home
but
arranged
in
small
oval
dishes
all
round
the
consumer
and
radiating
within
easy
reach
from
his
plate
making
his
the
centre
of
a
semicircle
and
thus
entirely
dispensing
with
that
fidget
the
waiter
such
an
arrangement
can
not
fail
to
coax
the
most
delicate
appetite
there
is
no
coarse
de
no
vast
joint
to
disgust
you
but
like
the
bee
you
flit
from
dish
to
dish
toying
now
with
a
prawn
now
with
a
till
you
suddenly
discover
that
you
are
unconsciously
replete
and
you
rise
from
the
table
feeling
that
it
was
a
good
supper
and
that
existence
is
not
such
a
struggle
after
all
altogether
the
victoria
is
a
most
charming
inn
either
to
the
mariner
wearied
by
the
cruel
buffetings
of
the
north
sea
or
to
the
sportsman
returning
straight
from
the
bleak
of
the
interior
of
norway
we
never
stayed
there
for
more
than
two
days
but
for
that
time
it
is
an
uninterrupted
dream
of
delight
we
had
a
very
hard
day
buying
all
sorts
of
things
to
make
our
stores
complete
jam
butter
whisky
soap
and
matches
tauchnitz
books
and
several
other
necessaries
the
butter
is
most
important
as
the
best
variety
that
can
be
got
up
country
is
extremely
nasty
the
worst
is
unutterably
vile
though
it
is
quite
possible
to
acquire
almost
a
liking
for
the
peculiarities
of
the
better
kind
after
starvation
has
stared
you
in
the
face
we
were
much
put
out
at
not
being
able
to
get
a
small
keg
of
whisky
as
we
fear
that
the
bottles
will
fare
badly
in
the
rough
travelling
we
shall
have
accounts
of
christiania
may
be
found
in
many
excellent
with
which
this
simple
story
can
not
hope
to
compete
so
we
will
not
attempt
to
describe
the
town
since
though
our
knowledge
of
all
the
grocers
shops
is
voluminous
and
exhaustive
we
are
totally
ignorant
of
the
interior
arrangements
of
either
the
churches
or
police
stations
the
skipper
was
very
anxious
to
get
some
violet
ink
because
he
is
firmly
convinced
that
it
is
the
only
sort
fit
for
a
gentleman
to
use
a
man
he
said
is
known
by
his
ink
so
we
went
into
many
shops
and
asked
for
that
concoction
always
in
the
english
tongue
then
we
arrived
at
a
shop
where
they
did
not
speak
our
language
and
here
suddenly
to
the
intense
surprise
of
esau
the
skipper
broke
forth
into
a
long
harangue
in
norse
concluding
with
an
extremely
neat
peroration
the
shopkeeper
listened
with
respectful
admiration
and
then
said
no
this
is
a
stationer
s
shop
we
do
not
keep
then
esau
gave
way
to
irreverent
laughter
and
the
shopkeeper
concluded
that
we
were
attempting
a
practical
joke
and
we
had
to
fly
the
skipper
was
not
angry
but
very
much
hurt
it
afterwards
transpired
that
he
had
got
up
the
whole
of
that
magnificent
burst
of
eloquence
out
of
bennett
s
phrase
book
and
then
it
had
failed
for
want
of
two
or
three
right
words
truly
very
hard
we
took
our
canoes
to
the
railway
station
and
despatched
them
to
lillehammer
this
afternoon
they
had
been
a
source
of
great
interest
to
all
beholders
since
our
arrival
especially
to
the
norwegians
who
have
all
a
sort
of
natural
affinity
with
any
kind
of
boat
and
seem
very
much
pleased
with
the
combined
lightness
and
strength
of
their
build
as
far
as
we
can
learn
they
are
the
first
of
the
kind
that
have
yet
been
brought
to
this
country
at
the
station
they
were
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
inquiring
norsemen
all
of
them
wondering
much
what
the
name
of
nettie
on
the
bows
of
the
skipper
s
craft
could
mean
and
spelling
it
over
very
slowly
and
carefully
aloud
when
we
came
away
one
of
them
evidently
a
linguist
had
just
translated
it
into
his
own
language
and
was
proceeding
to
conjugate
it
as
an
irregular
verb
chapter
iii
by
rail
and
lake
we
were
engaged
till
late
at
night
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
our
packing
the
last
thing
we
did
was
to
put
our
most
gorgeous
apparel
and
any
articles
not
likely
to
be
needed
during
our
camp
life
into
two
portmanteaus
with
strict
orders
to
the
boots
to
keep
the
same
until
our
return
this
morning
after
an
early
breakfast
on
descending
to
the
courtyard
we
found
these
portmanteaus
roped
down
on
the
roof
of
the
omnibus
which
was
to
take
all
the
luggage
to
the
station
for
lillehammer
this
we
rectified
and
then
set
off
to
walk
to
the
station
ourselves
now
esau
is
possessed
by
an
insensate
craving
for
anchovy
paste
which
he
considers
a
necessity
for
camping
he
said
it
imparts
a
certain
tone
to
the
stomach
and
aids
digestion
and
added
that
no
should
ever
be
without
it
which
sounds
a
little
like
an
advertisement
but
which
he
asserted
was
a
quotation
from
the
rules
laid
down
for
his
diet
by
andrew
clark
in
christiania
these
rules
are
not
strictly
adhered
to
either
by
esau
or
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
for
anchovy
paste
is
not
to
be
obtained
there
this
we
know
because
we
went
into
every
shop
in
the
town
and
asked
for
it
without
success
and
in
this
supreme
moment
when
we
were
walking
to
the
station
with
only
a
few
minutes
before
the
train
should
start
he
insisted
on
diving
into
a
wretched
pokey
little
shop
which
had
escaped
our
notice
yesterday
and
demanding
anchovy
paste
in
a
loud
english
voice
the
skipper
devoutly
thanked
providence
it
could
not
be
bought
as
he
declared
the
smell
of
it
alone
was
enough
to
put
a
man
off
his
breakfast
and
that
he
had
such
a
morbid
longing
for
hair
grease
that
he
could
not
have
prevented
himself
from
putting
it
on
his
head
we
got
our
baggage
safely
booked
and
ourselves
also
after
a
scene
of
riot
that
was
nothing
like
a
football
match
but
something
like
donnybrook
fair
and
at
last
found
ourselves
in
a
compartment
with
five
other
passengers
all
of
whom
had
a
most
inconsiderate
amount
of
luggage
with
them
in
the
carriage
while
we
contented
ourselves
with
four
guns
seven
two
axes
one
spade
four
hundred
and
fifty
cartridges
two
and
a
pair
of
glasses
we
calculated
that
we
saved
at
least
one
and
fourpence
by
taking
these
things
with
us
and
although
our
were
rather
profane
at
first
they
soon
settled
down
and
we
had
time
to
digest
the
fact
that
we
were
one
and
fourpence
to
the
good
it
was
very
warm
in
there
outside
the
thermometer
was
in
the
shade
but
we
survived
it
and
after
that
no
mere
heat
has
any
terrors
for
us
two
of
our
were
an
englishman
and
his
wife
who
had
a
maid
travelling
with
them
through
to
throndhjem
and
when
getting
the
tickets
the
booking
clerk
informed
them
that
there
were
no
through
tickets
issued
but
he
added
this
will
do
as
well
and
handed
them
one
first
and
one
third
through
ticket
which
we
thought
an
extremely
ingenious
way
out
of
the
difficulty
a
railway
journey
is
not
interesting
anywhere
and
less
so
in
norway
than
other
countries
as
there
is
not
even
the
sensation
of
speed
to
divert
your
mind
and
keep
you
excited
in
momentary
expectation
of
a
smash
uphill
the
pace
is
slow
because
it
can
not
be
fast
downhill
it
is
slow
for
fear
of
the
train
running
away
there
are
only
two
trains
a
day
one
very
early
one
rather
late
but
timed
to
arrive
at
its
destination
before
dark
for
there
is
no
travelling
by
night
directly
darkness
comes
on
the
train
is
stopped
and
the
passengers
turned
out
into
an
hotel
where
they
remain
to
rest
till
dawn
from
christiania
to
eidsvold
is
about
a
journey
and
during
that
time
the
guard
came
to
look
at
our
tickets
times
he
wanted
to
incite
us
to
commit
a
breach
of
the
peace
or
to
catch
us
offending
against
some
of
his
and
was
always
appearing
at
a
new
place
first
at
one
door
then
the
other
anon
peeping
at
us
through
the
hole
for
the
lamp
and
again
blinking
from
the
next
carriage
through
the
vessel
but
we
were
aware
of
his
intention
and
did
nothing
to
annoy
him
and
always
showed
the
same
tickets
till
they
were
worn
out
and
then
we
produced
strawberry
jam
labels
which
seemed
to
be
quite
satisfactory
we
reached
eidsvold
at
twelve
and
went
aboard
the
steamer
skiblädner
where
we
found
the
canoes
already
nicely
placed
lashed
on
the
we
had
a
delightful
voyage
up
the
mjösen
on
the
most
beautiful
of
norwegian
summer
days
in
the
best
of
norwegian
steamers
the
mjösen
is
the
largest
norwegian
lake
about
miles
long
and
the
say
it
is
feet
deep
but
we
had
not
time
to
measure
it
as
we
were
busy
admiring
the
scenery
on
the
saloon
table
most
of
the
way
this
steaming
up
the
mjösen
is
a
very
pleasant
way
of
spending
a
fine
day
the
shores
are
nowhere
strikingly
beautiful
but
always
pretty
and
charming
the
steamer
goes
fast
so
that
there
is
a
sensation
of
getting
on
and
not
losing
time
there
are
intervals
of
mild
excitement
whenever
we
come
to
a
village
and
take
up
or
disembark
passengers
generally
speaking
they
come
out
in
boats
but
occasionally
we
come
to
a
larger
and
more
important
place
where
there
is
a
pier
or
even
a
railway
and
at
these
the
excitement
is
greater
and
the
crowd
quite
worthy
of
the
name
the
folks
all
take
off
their
hats
directly
we
get
within
sight
and
continue
to
do
so
till
they
fade
away
or
sink
below
the
horizon
and
we
in
the
steamer
all
do
the
same
but
the
great
attraction
is
undoubtedly
dinner
which
is
uncommonly
well
served
in
the
saloon
every
luxury
that
can
be
obtained
being
placed
before
us
concluding
with
wild
strawberries
and
cream
of
the
frothiest
and
most
captivating
appearance
both
on
this
boat
and
her
sister
the
kong
oscar
they
take
great
pride
in
doing
things
well
very
much
as
the
old
which
occupied
a
parallel
position
in
england
used
to
do
the
kong
oscar
is
rather
the
faster
boat
but
we
consider
the
captain
of
the
skiblädner
to
be
lengths
ahead
of
his
rival
being
a
old
fellow
on
the
other
hand
the
skiblädner
handmaidens
are
not
comely
whereas
they
of
the
kong
oscar
are
renowned
for
their
beauty
not
only
in
norway
but
in
certain
stately
homes
of
england
that
we
wot
of
esau
lost
his
heart
to
one
of
them
two
years
ago
and
still
raves
about
her
though
the
only
way
in
which
he
endeavoured
to
win
her
affection
was
by
sitting
on
a
with
his
slouch
hat
tilted
over
his
eyes
gazing
at
her
with
mute
admiration
from
a
respectful
distance
while
she
alas
was
totally
unconscious
of
his
passion
he
never
told
his
love
because
he
could
not
speak
norse
we
arrived
at
lillehammer
about
eight
o
clock
and
went
to
the
victoria
hotel
from
the
flat
roof
of
which
after
an
excellent
dinner
we
enjoyed
a
pipe
and
one
of
the
prettiest
views
in
a
quiet
homely
style
of
prettiness
that
any
one
could
wish
to
see
just
at
our
feet
the
wooden
village
with
its
houses
and
their
red
roofs
then
some
green
slopes
and
feet
below
the
vast
extent
of
the
mjösen
lying
calm
and
still
and
looking
very
green
and
deep
with
the
and
deserted
steamers
apparently
quite
close
below
us
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
highish
hills
covered
with
fir
trees
and
to
the
right
the
river
laagen
with
its
green
waters
hurrying
down
from
the
mountains
in
a
broad
and
rapid
stream
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
just
across
the
road
in
front
of
the
hotel
there
is
a
nice
little
stream
which
turns
a
saw
and
rejoices
in
a
cool
splashing
waterfall
the
soothing
sound
of
which
refreshes
us
by
day
and
night
the
same
torrent
can
be
seen
higher
up
the
mountain
in
a
place
where
it
makes
some
rather
fine
falls
which
only
look
like
a
long
white
rag
fluttering
amongst
the
trees
at
this
distance
this
was
the
view
we
had
at
midnight
when
it
was
apparently
no
darker
than
immediately
after
sunset
and
a
good
deal
lighter
than
it
generally
is
in
london
at
midday
the
while
the
sky
was
covered
with
the
rich
glow
of
colouring
which
can
only
be
seen
in
the
northern
summer
there
were
two
englishmen
with
us
on
the
roof
with
whom
aided
by
coffee
we
roamed
over
the
greater
part
of
the
civilised
and
uncivilised
world
australia
canada
japan
turkey
and
ceylon
and
we
all
agreed
that
none
of
them
can
go
one
better
than
a
summer
night
in
norway
chapter
iv
by
road
we
arose
pretty
early
wishing
to
get
over
miles
of
ground
before
evening
which
with
the
canoes
would
be
a
long
day
s
work
as
we
had
the
natives
to
contend
with
who
by
reason
of
their
dreadfully
lazy
habits
are
most
difficult
to
bring
to
the
we
have
decided
after
long
experience
that
nothing
that
you
can
do
has
any
effect
in
hurrying
them
but
that
it
is
quite
possible
to
make
them
slower
by
losing
your
temper
or
taking
any
vigorous
measures
of
acceleration
they
seem
to
get
more
deliberate
and
aggravatingly
slow
as
they
grow
older
norwegian
boys
are
distractingly
restless
and
full
of
energy
and
look
as
if
they
have
had
nothing
to
eat
which
is
generally
the
actual
fact
judging
by
an
english
standard
of
what
constitutes
food
at
the
age
of
fifteen
they
become
better
fed
and
their
energy
departs
altogether
and
after
entirely
disappearing
it
keeps
getting
less
every
year
a
man
does
not
seem
to
need
much
food
certainly
not
as
much
as
an
englishman
and
prefers
that
of
the
worst
kind
conveyed
to
the
mouth
at
the
end
of
a
we
have
never
noticed
any
description
of
food
which
he
does
not
make
sour
rather
than
eat
it
when
sweet
bread
milk
cream
and
cheese
jam
and
cabbages
for
instance
are
articles
which
he
prefers
fermented
or
sour
he
reminds
one
of
the
cockney
who
complained
that
the
country
eggs
had
no
flavour
or
of
the
scotchman
who
replying
to
the
apologies
of
a
friend
in
whose
house
he
happened
to
get
a
bad
egg
said
ma
dear
freend
ah
em
but
his
laziness
and
love
of
nasty
food
are
almost
the
only
bad
qualities
that
we
have
discovered
in
him
he
is
ridiculously
honest
and
his
kindness
and
hospitality
are
beyond
praise
this
morning
however
the
laziness
was
the
quality
chiefly
conspicuous
and
though
we
ordered
our
conveyances
last
night
and
got
up
early
for
us
we
did
not
succeed
in
starting
till
twelve
o
clock
footnote
save
perhaps
on
three
points
fishing
tackle
strong
drinks
and
straps
or
pieces
of
cord
which
may
be
committed
to
memory
as
a
fly
a
flask
and
a
we
first
despatched
the
canoes
and
baggage
packed
on
a
kind
of
low
waggon
and
then
got
into
a
double
cariole
which
is
something
like
a
gig
ourselves
and
drove
gaily
off
along
the
throndhjem
road
we
did
not
however
follow
it
far
but
turning
to
the
left
down
a
steep
hill
we
crossed
the
laagen
by
a
long
and
rather
handsome
bridge
and
then
up
a
winding
road
on
the
further
side
all
looking
very
pretty
on
such
a
glorious
day
the
road
became
more
picturesque
the
further
we
got
from
lillehammer
every
turn
bringing
us
to
some
fresh
combination
of
mountain
rock
and
waterfall
especially
rock
there
are
so
many
tracts
of
country
in
norway
entirely
composed
of
rock
that
as
esau
remarked
probably
no
one
will
ever
find
a
use
for
it
we
lunched
at
a
nice
little
station
called
neisteen
a
delicious
meal
off
trout
strawberries
and
cream
and
fladbrod
for
which
they
charged
us
a
shilling
each
fladbrod
is
the
staple
food
of
the
country
folk
in
norway
they
make
it
of
or
but
the
best
and
commonest
is
that
composed
of
it
is
simply
meal
and
water
baked
on
a
large
flat
circular
iron
and
is
about
the
thickness
of
cardboard
of
a
brownish
colour
and
very
crisp
the
taste
for
it
is
easily
acquired
in
the
absence
of
other
food
and
with
butter
it
becomes
quite
delicious
to
a
hungry
man
at
neisteen
there
was
a
little
shop
where
the
skipper
at
last
obtained
his
violet
ink
but
esau
was
foiled
in
his
dastardly
attempt
at
retaliation
with
anchovy
paste
after
this
our
road
lay
along
a
lovely
river
for
fishing
and
we
were
much
tempted
to
stop
and
try
a
cast
in
it
especially
as
we
saw
natives
luring
fish
from
their
rocky
haunts
by
the
norwegian
method
they
first
settle
how
far
they
want
to
cast
say
thirty
feet
then
cut
down
a
pine
tree
take
the
bark
off
it
tie
a
string
to
the
thin
end
and
a
hook
to
the
string
stick
a
worm
on
the
hook
and
go
forth
to
the
strife
when
the
fish
bites
they
strike
with
great
rapidity
and
violence
and
is
bound
to
go
generally
it
is
the
fish
which
leaves
its
native
element
at
a
speed
which
must
astonish
it
describes
half
of
a
circle
at
the
same
rate
and
lands
either
in
a
tree
or
on
a
rock
with
sufficient
force
to
break
itself
but
we
had
no
time
to
spare
especially
as
for
this
stage
we
had
a
bad
shying
jibbing
horse
and
a
perfect
fool
of
a
driver
near
the
last
station
we
passed
three
english
people
on
the
road
who
our
driver
informed
us
lived
near
there
he
told
us
their
name
was
wunkle
but
the
man
at
the
next
station
said
it
was
punkum
and
we
could
not
decide
which
of
these
two
common
english
names
it
was
most
likely
to
be
kvisberg
the
last
station
on
this
road
was
reached
at
but
before
this
the
road
which
had
gradually
got
worse
all
the
way
from
lillehammer
had
faded
away
and
disappeared
and
as
the
road
got
worse
so
did
the
hired
conveyances
so
that
we
were
gradually
reduced
from
the
gorgeous
double
cariole
with
red
cushions
with
which
we
started
and
a
horse
that
could
hardly
be
held
in

a
springless
jolting

pony

required

induce

kvisberg
is
situated
with
peculiar
disregard
for
appropriateness
of
position
on
the
side
of
an
almost
unclimbable
hill
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
place
where
the
road
departs
into
the
hereafter
no
english
horse
would
take
a
cart
up
such
a
hill
but
norwegian
ponies
are
like
the
duke
s
army
and
will
go
anywhere
and
do
anything
only
you
must
give
them
plenty
of
time
we
mounted
to
the
station
a
wretched
little
place
and
being
hungry
ordered
coffee
and
eggs
for
which
repast
we
paid
each
and
then
at
ten
o
clock
got
a
man
to
carry
our
few
small
things
the
last
six
miles
to
dalbakken
where
we
intended
to
sleep
the
night
the
walk
was
delightful
through
a
precipitous
thickly
wooded
gorge
at
the
bottom
of
which
the
river
which
we
had
followed
all
day
went
leaping
and
foaming
along
though
it
was
now
reduced
to
a
mere
mountain
torrent
about
a
mile
from
our
journey
s
end
we
were
overtaken
by
a
norwegian
student
on
a
walking
tour
who
spoke
a
little
english
and
walked
with
us
the
rest
of
the
way
as
he
too
was
bound
for
dalbakken

study
of

at
dalbakken
we
reached
it
at
midnight
and
were
not
much
gratified
to
find
that
it
was
a
very
small
poor
building
and
that
our
luggage
had
not
arrived
we
had
been
hoping
against
hope
that
it
might
have
done
so
as
we
had
not
seen
it
anywhere
on
the
road
the
next
pleasant
discovery
was
that
four
other
travellers
had
arrived
before
us
and
taken
all
the
rooms
this
fact
was
first
conveyed
to
our
minds
by
seeing
four
pairs
of
socks
hanging
out
of
the
upstair
windows
to
dry
at
which
sight
we
began
to
suspect
that
things
were
going
to
turn
out
unpleasant
for
us
but
at
last
we
got
a
room
with
one
very
small
bed
between
us
we
tossed
for
this
bed
and
the
skipper
won
so
esau
passed
the
night
on
the
floor
on
a
sheepskin
and
was
very
comfortable
at
least
he
said
so
next
morning
the
natives
here
were
much
impressed
by
all
our
habits
and
belongings
but
especially
by
our
sleeping
with
the
window
open
wherefore
the
old
woman
of
the
sæter
below
kept
bouncing
into
the
room
at
intervals
during
the
night
to
see
us
perform
that
heroic
feat
and
though
it
was
flattering
to
be
made
so
much
of
still
fame
has
its
drawbacks

which
all

driven

the
general
appearance
of
the
place
caused
us
to
expect
nightly
visitations
from
other
foes
not
human

to
our
surprise
there
were
none

three
quarters
of
a
mile
from

chapter
the
first
camp
we
slept
well
and
at
eight
o
clock
the
skipper
always
first
to
wake
got
up
and
looking
out
of
the
window
saw
thence
the
four
bad
men
who
had
taken
the
rooms
before
us
and
hung
their
socks
out
of
the
window
just
starting
on
their
journey
and
looking
as
if
they
did
so
with
an
easy
conscience
some
men
can
carry
with
a
light
heart
and
gay
demeanour
a
weight
of
crime
that
would
wreck
the
happiness
of
less
hardened
ruffians
then
he
turned
his
gaze
in
the
opposite
direction
and
oh
joy
our
luggage
and
boats
were
in
sight
and
arrived
directly
afterwards
the
man
in
charge
said
he
had
travelled
all
night
with
them
without
sleeping
and
to
judge
from
his
appearance
we
imagined
that
his
statement
was
correct
he
had
been
sitting
on
the
skipper
s
bag
for
miles
and
from
the
state
of
its
interior
we
calculated
his
weight
to
be
about
stone
he
was
very
after
his
mere
trifle
of
a
journey
and
vigil
and
asked
for
more
money
on
hearing
that
he
had
three
quarters
of
a
mile
further
to
go
this
was
very
sad
and
we
thought
showed
an
unchristian
spirit
but
we
sternly
urged
him
forward
and
all
ended
happily
on
our
arrival
at
espedals
when
we
paid
him
his
money
and
a
shilling

to

after

there
and
dismissing
the
men
we
put
the

into

the
skipper
s
first
cast
these
tactics
to
an
inexperienced
voyageur
might
look
like
the
acts
of
an
ordinary
lunatic
but
it
should
be
explained
that
the
long
exposure
to
the
sun
which
the
canoes
had
undergone
had
caused
them
to
leak
badly
and
they
required
soaking
to
swell
up
the
joints
before
they
could
be
intrusted
with
our
valuable
property

persons
besides
this
we
were
hungry

thought
it
a
good
opportunity
for
lunch

had
to
make
some
previously
arranged
alterations

the
baggage

a

lightening
it

lasted

more
than
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
end
of
the
lake
and
found
a
very
nice
about
ten
yards
from
the
shore
on
the
south
bank
with
what
the
poets
call
a
babbling
brook
close
to
it
pitched
the
tent
and
had
a
simple
dinner
of
bacon
eggs
and
jam
the
last
dinner
during
our
trip
at
which
trout
did
not
find
a
place
then
we
sallied
forth
in
the
canoes
to
fish
esau
was
the
last
to
leave
the
shore
and
as
he
paddled
off
he
noticed
the
skipper
s
rod
in
the
familiar
norwegian
shape
of
a
bow
and
found
him
struggling
with
two
on
at
the
same
time
both
of
which
he
landed
and
found
to
be
over
lb
each
first
blood
claimed
and
allowed
to
quote
the
terse
language
of
the
prize
ring
not
a
bad
beginning
but
we
only
got
a
few
more
about
the
same
weight
they
came
very
short
but
were
remarkably
game
fish
when
hooked
and
in
condition
we
turned
in
about
eleven
when
it
began
to
rain
a
little
and
slept
with
our
heads
under
the
blankets
the
mosquitoes
being
in
countless
multitudes
it
was
a
lovely
morning
and
the
lake
looked
its
best
but
it
is
not
strikingly
beautiful
compared
with
many
that
we
have
seen
it
has
high
rugged
hills
on
both
sides
and
pine
woods
down
to
the
water
s
edge
and
some
small
islands
dotted
about
the
upper
end
of
it
but
the
lake
is
rather
shallow
the
pine
trees
rather
stunted
and
there
are
a
good
many
wooden
huts
and
sæters
on
the
which
although
they
appear
to
be
mostly
uninhabited
detract
from
the
wildness
of
the
scenery
the
natives
have
one
or
two
boats
on
the
lake
and
do
some
fishing
on
their
own
account
we
saw
a
man
engaged
in
the
atrocious
employment
of
fishing
with
an
any
natives
who
see
our
camp
when
rowing
past
come
to
shore
to
inspect
us
and
our
belongings
they
all
adopt
the
same
course
of
procedure
they
land
and
stare
and
say
nothing
then
they
pull
up
their
boat
and
make
it
safe
and
advancing
close
to
the
tent
stare
and
say
nothing
either
to
each
other
or
us
then
esau
says
confidentially
as
if
it
was
a
new
and
brilliant
idea
he
has
done
exactly
the
same
thing
some
scores
of
times
we
d
better
be
civil
to
these
fellows
perhaps
they
could
bring
us
some
eggs
and
they
look
pretty
the
natives
are
all
the
time
staring
and
saying
nothing
then
esau
remarks
in
norwegian
it
is
fine
weather
have
you
any
eggs
to
this
the
chief
native
replies
at
great
length
in
his
own
barbarous
jargon
and
esau
not
having
understood
a
single
syllable
answers
ja
ja
yes
but
have
you
any
eggs
then
aside
to
the
skipper
wonder
what
the
deuce
the
fool
was
talking
about
soon
the
natives
perceive
that
their
words
are
wasted
and
relapse
into
the
silent
staring
condition
again
and
after
a
time
and
a
half
or
two
times
they
depart
as
they
came
sometimes
they
return
again
with
eggs
in
a
basket
when
we
pay
them
well
and
give
them
some
fish
at
other
times
they
look
upon
us
as
dangerous
lunatics
and
avoid
us
like
the
plague
esau
learnt
this
habit
of
asking
for
eggs
when
we
were
on
a
fishing
expedition
near
the
south
coast
of
norway
on
one
occasion
there
we
arrived
at
a
small
village
with
an
enormous
quantity
of
trout
that
we
had
caught
in
the
adjoining
fjord
and
found
a
small
crowd
of
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
seafaring
men
idly
lounging
round
an
open
space
between
the
cottages
he
first
went
round
and
presented
each
of
those
men
with
two
trout
solemnly
without
a
word
as
though
it
were
a
religious
ceremony
then
he
began
at
the
first
man
again
and
said
have
you
eggs
and
receiving
a
reply
in
the
negative
he
went
on
to
the
next
and
to
each
one
of
the
group
asking
the
same
weird
question
the
men
who
had
been
chatting
busily
amongst
themselves
up
to
the
moment
of
our
arrival
became
silent
they
did
not
laugh
but
only
looked
at
one
another
and
one
of
them
shyly
felt
in
his
pocket
to
see
if
there
were
any
eggs
there
whose
existence
he
might
have
chanced
to
forget
presently
as
we
could
get
no
eggs
we
moved
off
sorrowfully
but
not
discouraged
and
the
men
remained
looking
after
us
silent
and
uncertain
thus
the
interview
ended
and
we
regained
our
boat
the
beach
here
was
capital
for
bathing
and
we
enjoyed
a
delightful
tub
this
morning
the
more
pleasant
indeed
because
at
dalbakken
we
slept
in
our
clothes
and
only
had
a
to
wash
in
next
morning
immediately
after
bathing
we
lit
a
fire
and
the
cook
commenced
operations
the
office
of
cook
being
held
alternately
by
each
of
us
for
one
day
the
man
from
dalbakken
brought
us
some
milk
so
we
indulged
in
coffee
when
we
have
only
tin
milk
we
drink
tea
for
though
tin
milk
will
do
fairly
with
tea
we
think
it
wretched
with
coffee
after
breakfast
we
each
took
our
canoe
and
went
fishing
wherever
the
spirit
moved
us
taking
lunch
with
us
on
a
day
of
this
sort
if
the
fish
are
rising
we
have
a
great
time
and
if
they
won
t
rise
we
lie
on
the
bank
in
the
sun
and
smoke
or
sketch
or
kill
mosquitoes
and
have
a
great
time
in
that
case
also
so
that
the
hours
pass
in
a
blissful
round
of
enjoyment
and
all
is
peace
having
each
one
his
own
ship
we
are
quite
independent
only
taking
care
to
return
to
camp
about
six
o
clock
to
get
dinner
ready
after
that
there
is
nearly
always
a
rise
and
we
fish
till
about
eleven
when
we
generally
turn
in
though
it
is
by
no
means
dark
by
that
time
and
on
a
few
occasions
when
the
fish
were
rising
very
well
we
have
fished
on
all
through
the
night
and
into
the
next
day
losing
count
of
the
almanack
and
conducting
life
on
the
principles
of
going
to
bed
when
tired
and
eating
when
hungry
so
that
like
the
snark
we
might
be
said
to
frequently
breakfast
at
five
o
clock
tea
and
dine
on
the
following
day
there
was
very
little
wind
and
these
fish
being
very
shy
and
apt
to
come
short
it
was
almost
impossible
to
get
them
without
a
ripple
until
evening
when
large
white
moths
began
to
show
on
the
water
and
the
trout
became
bolder
consequently
we
did
not
make
great
bags
though
the
fish
caught
were
very
good
ones
at
night
there
was
one
of
the
most
lovely
sunsets
ever
seen
the
sun
went
down
right
at
the
other
end
of
the
lake
so
that
we
had
an
uninterrupted
view
with
all
the
glorious
colours
of
the
sky
reflected
in
the
water
and
we
agreed
that
the
effects
about
ten
this
evening
formed
as
good
a
symphony
in
purple
and
orange
as
a
man
could
expect
to
find
out
of
the
grosvenor
gallery
the
morning
began
with
a
dead
calm
but
this
soon
gave
place
to
such
a
wind
down
the
lake
that
we
were
induced
to
strike
the
camp
pack
the
canoes
and
proceed
on
our
voyage
into
the
unknown
illustration
diver
we
started
soon
after
eleven
lunched
near
megrunden
and
saw
there
two
divers
on
the
lake
which
esau
pursued
for
some
time
but
of
course
never
got
near
them
some
of
the
dives
they
made
to
avoid
his
advancing
canoe
seemed
to
be
about
half
a
mile
in
length
just
below
böle
we
caught
several
fish
but
kept
paddling
on
with
our
favourable
wind
casting
every
now
and
then
in
likely
places
and
soon
came
to
a
rapid
with
a
rough
bridge
thrown
across
its
upper
end
the
rapid
was
very
shallow
so
that
we
did
not
dare
to
attempt
to
run
it
with
loaded
boats
and
had
to
make
a
portage
even
then
we
got
a
few
bumps
in
running
it
but
arrived
at
the
bottom
all
right
now
the
scene
changed
we
were
in
a
smaller
and
narrower
part
of
the
valley
buildings
had
entirely
disappeared
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
gloomy
pine
forests
and
mountains
the
weather
also
was
quickly
changing
and
evidently
intending
to
be
wet
and
stormy
so
we
pushed
on
rapidly
one
coasting
on
each
side
of
the
lake
till
we
reached
its
further
extremity
where
esau
was
nearly
swamped
crossing
the
waves
as
the
wind
began
to
blow
harder
every
minute
soon
the
rain
was
upon
us
while
we
looked
for
a
but
found
none
as
the
shores
were
everywhere
very
swampy
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
inland
at
length
we
came
to
a
second
rapid
where
the
natives
have
thrown
a
clumsy
weir
across
for
some
unknown
purpose
and
here
we
found
a
fairly
dry
spot
made
our
portage
in
heavy
rain
and
wind
with
a
great
deal
of
groaning
misery
and
brandy
and
water
pitched
the
tent
and
after
struggling
for
about
half
an
hour
got
a
dyspeptic
fire
to
fizzle
and
so
cooked
some
fish
and
eggs
and
then
had
tea
in
the
tent
after
this
we
were
a
little
more
comfortable
as
it
was
very
nice
and
dry
inside
but
it
was
midnight
before
we
had
finished
all
our
portage
got
the
canoes
down
into
the
next
lake
and
made
everything
snug
for
the
night
so
that
we
were
quite
exhausted
as
our
day
had
commenced
at
seven
the
mosquitoes
were
more
numerous
here
than
at
any
place
we
have
yet
seen
footnote
the
various
places
mentioned
on
the
voyage
are
not
villages
as
one
might
imagine
from
the
dot
that
marks
them
on
the
ordnance
map
but
generally
only
a
single
log
hut
and
for
the
most
part
not
inhabited
or
habitable
july
it
rained
all
night
but
as
tweedledum
said
of
his
umbrella
not
under
here
and
a
ditch
we
made
last
night
kept
our
floor
quite
dry
lighting
a
fire
for
breakfast
was
a
toilsome
business
but
at
last
we
found
some
wood
dry
enough
to
burn
it
continued
raining
in
a
nice
kind
of
manner
so
we
resided
in
the
tent
and
read
and
indulged
in
whisky
and
water
for
lunch
to
counteract
any
ill
effects
of
the
reading
for
some
of
it
was
poetry
our
tent
was
about
of
a
mile
from
the
end
of
bred
sjö
and
after
lunch
we
both
went
in
one
canoe
to
reconnoitre
the
next
rapid
which
is
a
long
one
down
to
olstappen
vand
we
found
that
it
is
quite
impracticable
for
canoes
the
river
simply
running
violently
down
a
steep
place
till
it
perishes
in
the
lake
about
a
mile
of
rapid
with
hardly
enough
decently
behaved
water
in
the
whole
of
it
to
hold
a
dozen
trout
but
there
a
dozen
for
we
caught
them
one
wherever
there
was
a
little
turnhole
how
we
were
to
get
down
that
river
was
concealed
in
the
unfathomable
depths
of
the
mysterious
future
chapter
vi
misery
it
rained
all
night
again
and
all
day
this
was
dreadful
and
not
at
all
like
norway
we
have
always
made
a
rule
that
we
may
fish
on
sunday
but
not
shoot
some
people
draw
an
even
finer
distinction
and
say
it
is
allowable
to
shoot
with
a
rifle
but
not
with
a
gun
this
we
have
always
thought
too
subtle
now
yesterday
was
sunday
and
esau
having
observed
two
divers
on
the
lake
while
the
skipper
was
out
fishing
went
and
secreted
himself
with
a
gun
where
he
expected
them
to
come
over
hoping
that
they
would
be
alarmed
by
the
other
canoe
on
its
return
this
soon
happened
and
they
flew
within
forty
yards
of
him
both
barrels
were
discharged
and
esau
returned
to
camp
muttering
something
about
birds
of
that
kind
having
immortal
bodies
if
they
hadn
t
immortal
the
result
of
was
no
doubt
this
miserable
weather
the
camp
presented
a
most
cheerless
prospect
the
canoes
were
drawn
up
on
land
and
turned
bottom
upwards
the
kitchen
stowed
away
under
a
soaked
sack
a
very
camp
fire
smouldering
before
the
tent
surrounded
by
old
backbones
of
fish
and
some
apology
for
firewood
our
two
rods
standing
up
against
the
gloomy
sky
with
the
wind
whistling
through
their
lines
and
all
the
scenery
blotted
out
with
rain
and
mist
and
scudding
clouds
that
drifted
down
the
valley
and
gave
very
occasional
glimpses
of
extremely
wet
mountains
the
cook
clad
in
a
macintosh
with
a
spade
in
his
hand
watching
a
pot
which
was
trying
to
boil
on
the
spluttering
fire
his
trousers
tucked
into
his
socks
and
his
boots
shining
with
wet
would
have
given
any
one
a
pretty
good
idea
of
the
meaning
of
the
expression
played
illustration
view
of
bredsjö
by
night
the
mosquitoes
were
bad
here
and
we
spent
much
of
our
leisure
time
making
war
against
them
esau
s
favourite
way
of
clearing
the
road
was
to
bring
in
a
smoking
log
of
pitch
pine
close
up
the
ventilation
and
fill
the
tent
with
smoke
it
forced
us
to
quit
but
not
the
mosquitoes
as
they
appeared
to
fall
into
a
deep
and
tranquil
sleep
from
which
they
awoke
refreshed
and
ready
to
renew
the
attack
just
a
few
minutes
before
the
tent
again
became
habitable
for
human
beings
prowling
round
the
tent
and
squashing
them
with
our
fingers
was
perhaps
the
best
plan
but
we
were
obliged
to
sleep
with
a
rug
over
our
heads
and
covered
up
at
every
point
to
avoid
their
intrusion
at
night
still
rain
and
nothing
but
rain
it
stopped
for
an
hour
or
two
last
night
and
the
lake
looked
uncommonly
pretty
among
its
dark
surroundings
but
the
downpour
soon
began
again
in
our
desperation
yesterday
afternoon
we
arranged
with
a
native
whom
the
skipper
discovered
to
bring
a
horse
and
sleigh
to
meet
us
at
the
next
rapid
and
help
us
down
with
our
baggage
to
olstappen
therefore
we
got
up
early
and
were
down
at
the
rapid
about
ten
o
clock
where
we
found
our
man
waiting
the
rain
at
this
period
was
the
worst
variety
we
have
yet
seen
and
it
has
tried
all
kinds
during
the
last
four
days
we
packed
everything
on
the
sleigh
covered
it
with
our
ground
sheets
and
then
put
the
wheels
on
our
canoes
and
followed
down
the
track
there
is
a
halfway
down
the
river
which
is
simply
perfect
it
is
perched
on
piles
over
the
middle
of
the
stream
where
it
dashes
through
a
rift
in
a
huge
black
cliff
and
the
water
goes
tearing
past
down
a
long
shoot
made
of
logs
and
plunges
down
at
the
end
churned
into
a
mass
of
white
foam
with
noise
and
spray
that
quite
bewilder
one
we
got
down
to
olstappen
at
last
not
without
a
good
deal
of
hard
work
and
paid
our
man
on
our
way
we
met
a
norwegian
tourist
who
was
on
a
walking
tour
with
his
sister
and
had
left
her
rained
up
so
to
speak
in
a
sæter
and
was
strolling
about
in
the
forest
to
wile
away
the
time
he
spoke
a
very
little
english
and
we
had
a
long
talk
with
him
as
he
had
a
for
us
and
was
quite
ready
to
curse
the
rain
with
us
or
any
one
else
the
norwegians
men
and
women
seem
to
go
a
good
deal
on
walking
tours
and
probably
know
infinitely
more
of
their
fatherland
than
does
the
average
briton
of
this
island
the
superiority
of
which
he
seldom
fails
to
impress
on
the
foreigner
at
midday
we
launched
our
canoes
on
olstappen
which
is
a
fine
wide
lake
and
not
so
rainy
as
bredsjö
being
several
hundred
feet
lower
we
paddled
across
to
the
mouth
of
the
vinstra
river
a
rather
perilous
undertaking
for
where
the
wind
met
the
river
there
was
a
nasty
sea
on
and
we
shipped
some
water
but
got
safe
to
land
we
could
not
find
a
decent
camp
till
we
had
walked
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
lake
up
the
river
there
we
found
a
nice
sheltered
place
pretty
and
close
to
the
river
made
our
portage
and
pitched
the
tent
and
with
tea
our
drooping
spirits
began
to
revive
who
is
proof
against
a
hot
meal
of
trout
and
bacon
buttered
eggs
and
tea
even
though
our
clothes
and
equipments
were
all
wet
through
and
we
had
a
damp
change
of
raiment
sleeping
rugs
and
boots
but
now
the
wind
had
changed
and
we
looked
forward
to
the
morrow
as
the
wearied
traveller
always
look
forward
to
the
morrow
there
were
many
sandpipers
at
the
mouth
of
this
river
we
caught
one
young
one
and
had
serious
thoughts
of
taking
its
innocent
life
for
our
tea
but
better
feelings
prevailed
and
we
released
it
as
an
offering
for
fine
weather
and
caught
four
trout
instead
hurrah
the
rain
stopped
during
the
night
and
this
morning
actually
the
sun
shone
out
now
and
then
we
heaped
up
a
huge
fire
and
dried
all
our
belongings
and
then
had
nearly
a
whole
day
before
us
free
for
fishing
a
voyaging
day
is
a
big
business
we
calculate
that
it
takes
us
two
and
a
half
hours
to
pack
up
from
an
old
camp
breakfast
and
get
aboard
ship
but
to
pitch
the
camp
in
a
new
place
takes
much
longer
first
you
have
to
find
a
suitable
place
often
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
in
a
country
like
this
where
level
spaces
a
yard
square
are
very
rare
dig
a
trench
pitch
the
tent
and
arrange
everything
in
it
collect
firewood
and
make
a
place
for
the
fire
see
that
the
boats
and
everything
about
the
tent
are
safe
from
harm
should
the
stormy
winds
begin
to
blow
and
then
cook
dinner
all
this
can
not
be
done
under
three
hours
of
hard
work
so
that
if
in
addition
you
propose
getting
over
a
considerable
amount
of
ground
it
is
sure
to
be
a
long
and
toilsome
day
but
the
following
day
you
wake
up
with
a
glorious
feeling
of
duty
performed
and
pleasure
to
look
forward
to
the
skipper
with
a
hankering
after
cleanliness
washed
a
lot
of
clothes
and
himself
having
left
the
rain
to
perform
the
latter
operation
for
the
last
two
or
three
days
but
esau
not
being
troubled
with
any
such
absurd
remnants
of
civilisation
went
up
the
river
reconnoitring
in
his
natural
condition
he
came
back
to
dinner
in
a
perfectly
rapturous
state
having
caught
a
remarkably
nice
bag
of
fish
got
a
beautiful
view
of
the
jotunfjeld
mountains
and
found
a
waterfall
which
he
said
was
the
best
in
norway
and
therefore
in
the
world
the
skipper
had
tried
the
lake
in
the
afternoon
without
success
so
after
dinner
we
both
went
out
and
soon
discovered
the
reason
seven
boats
full
of
natives
were
out
with
a
huge
flue
net
which
they
shot
in
a
circle
and
then
beat
the
water
enclosed
till
all
the
wretched
fish
were
in
the
net
we
saw
them
get
thirty
in
one
haul
and
besides
this
there
was
a
boat
ottering
and
although
we
captured
a
few
fish
it
was
obvious
that
with
all
this
netting
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
lake
to
be
good
chapter
vii
happiness
this
was
a
really
fine
day
such
as
we
consider
proper
to
norway
no
uncertain
but
a
day
when
an
untiring
sun
shone
down
from
an
immaculate
sky
and
everything
looked
lovely
our
tent
was
on
a
nice
bit
of
turf
close
to
the
vinstra
river
which
is
about
as
broad
as
the
thames
at
eton
but
with
probably
twice
the
volume
of
water
and
certainly
three
times
its
rapidity
it
rushed
past
our
door
at
such
a
pace
that
no
boat
could
stem
it
and
as
far
as
we
could
see
up
the
reach
it
came
down
in
an
equally
swift
torrent
so
that
all
day
and
all
night
there
was
a
swilling
rushing
sound
very
pleasant
to
hear
and
creating
a
sensation
of
coolness
in
warm
weather
esau
considered
it
just
the
of
a
trout
stream
for
any
fish
hooked
in
it
gave
a
lot
of
trouble
before
he
was
safe
in
the
bag
it
ran
into
the
lake
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
our
tent
forming
a
delta
at
its
mouth
at
the
further
side
of
the
delta
there
were
some
fishermen
s
huts
from
which
emanated
the
seven
of
natives
whom
we
saw
yesterday
netting
and
thence
a
track
leads
up
the
banks
of
the
river
to
a
lake
called
slangen
two
miles
away
the
inhabitants
of
these
huts
came
in
a
boat
this
morning
to
see
our
camp
while
we
were
at
breakfast
inside
the
tent
they
poked
their
heads
in
grinning
and
staring
and
saying
nothing
then
we
did
the
honours
showed
them
our
most
interesting
possessions
american
axes
knives
rods
with
all
of
which
they
were
greatly
impressed
then
one
picked
up
a
bar
of
yellow
soap
that
was
lying
on
a
box
and
they
all
wondered
much
at
that
then
we
talked
to
them
for
a
brief
space
chiefly
out
of
bennett
s
phrase
book
and
considered
the
interview
at
an
end
but
they
not
go
and
remained
silently
staring
at
all
our
movements
so
at
last
we
ignored
their
presence
altogether
which
we
have
found
the
most
effectual
way
of
getting
rid
of
a
norwegian
peasant
and
they
gradually
departed
one
by
one
till
only
one
was
left
to
this
man
we
gave
a
cup
of
our
now
cold
coffee
which
was
not
at
all
good
especially
when
compared
with
the
delicious
coffee
which
is
always
forthcoming
even
in
the
meanest
norwegian
hut
he
drank
this
for
they
consider
it
a
breach
of
etiquette
to
refuse
proffered
food
and
immediately
left
as
if
he
remembered
an
engagement
having
first
thanked
us
in
a
rather
constrained
manner
we
were
glad
when
our
callers
were
gone
for
we
had
found
them
difficult
as
the
french
say
but
we
took
advantage
of
their
arrival
to
make
arrangements
with
one
of
them
to
bring
three
ponies
and
sleighs
to
the
other
side
of
the
delta
morning
when
we
hope
to
renew
our
journey
after
this
we
both
went
up
the
river
on
opposite
sides
for
the
skipper
had
become
inflamed
by
a
wish
to
see
the
waterfall
which
esau
discovered
yesterday
one
of
the
great
advantages
of
norway
consists
in
being
able
to
leave
your
tent
and
all
other
belongings
quite
to
themselves
even
when
you
know
that
there
are
several
people
about
and
shrewdly
suspect
that
the
place
where
you
have
made
your
camp
is
a
hay
meadow
belonging
to
one
of
them
we
had
a
dim
idea
that
such
was
the
case
here
not
because
there
was
any
grass
but
because
there
were
very
few
stones
and
a
norwegian
mows
down
everything
for
hay
except
the
stones
the
skipper
came
back
with
a
very
pretty
bag
of
fish
he
had
been
up
to
the
fall
and
thought
it
quite
deserved
all
esau
s
commendation
and
his
opinion
is
worth
more
because
he
has
seen
many
of
the
great
american
falls
and
other
stock
sights
of
the
world
it
is
not
marked
on
the
ordnance
map
there
is
no
path
to
it
or
near
it
but
you
come
on
it
suddenly
by
following
the
river
up
through
the
pine
forest
and
on
turning
a
corner
see
the
whole
body
of
the
vinstra
shooting
over
a
cliff
in
one
mad
leap
of
perhaps
a
little
more
than
a
hundred
feet
of
course
the
height
and
volume
of
water
are
insignificant
compared
with
many
falls
but
the
beauty
of
its
situation
can
scarcely
be
excelled
and
to
us
its
greatest
charm
is
its
solitude
and
freedom
from
paths
tourists
and
all
the
other
unpleasant
attributes
of
show
places
esau
following
up
the
north
bank
of
the
river
was
not
so
successful
fishing
and
after
crossing
the
slangen
river
which
joins
the
vinstra
about
a
mile
above
our
camp
he
struck
across
the
forest
to
see
his
beloved
fall
again
and
try
to
sketch
it
he
came
back
in
a
bad
temper
saying
that
he
thought
ruysdael
and
turner
could
make
something
of
it
the
former
to
do
the
water
and
the
latter
the
spray
mist
rainbows
and
roar
and
he
wanted
to
write
home
and
get
them
to
come
out
on
purpose
and
when
the
skipper
suggested
that
they
had
given
up
painting
he
said
it
was
a
great
pity
for
he
had
not
time
now
to
do
it
himself
there
is
a
corduroy
bridge
over
the
slangen
river
close
to
its
junction
with
the
vinstra
and
over
this
bridge
we
shall
go
we
had
intended
to
cruise
up
the
slangen
and
fish
slangen
lake
but
we
found
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
continue
our
journey
from
the
further
end
of
it
if
we
did
so
and
therefore
decided
to
omit
that
part
of
the
programme
though
we
are
sorry
to
leave
out
slangen
as
it
is
a
beautiful
lake
we
have
probably
been
repaid
for
the
miseries
of
the
last
week
by
the
beauty
of
our
waterfall
the
volume
of
which
has
doubtless
been
much
increased
by
the
exceptional
rain
of
the
last
few
days
early
to
bed
and
early
to
rise
we
breakfasted
soon
after
seven
and
then
packed
everything
and
crossed
the
mouth
of
the
vinstra
in
two
norse
boats
assisted
by
two
or
three
men
who
had
come
to
help
our
horses
and
sleighs
on
the
journey
we
had
terrible
difficulty
in
getting
the
canoes
placed
in
what
we
considered
a
safe
position
on
the
sleighs
but
it
was
done
at
last
and
the
motley
caravan
started
about
first
the
noble
owners
then
a
man
who
had
got
nothing
on
earth
to
do
with
the
affair
then
two
women
laughing
and
yelling
like
lunatics
then
a
sleigh
drawn
by
a
large
pony
and
carrying
two
boxes
cans
guns
and
canoe
next
some
boys
urging
the
large
pony
to
herculean
exertions
then
the
organiser
of
the
transport
department
who
was
apparently
a
professional
fool
by
the
inordinate
laughter
which
his
every
action
caused
then
some
more
women
and
a
smaller
pony
and
sleigh
with
the
other
canoe
and
all
the
rest
of
the
luggage
excepting
one
bag
lastly
another
man
leading
an
extremely
small
pony
and
sleigh
with
absolutely
nothing
on
it
the
man
carrying
the
remaining
bag
for
fear
of
tiring
the
pony
this
mob
of
loafers
had
arrived
in
boats
from
svatsum
which
is
a
small
village
five
miles
distant
at
the
north
end
of
olstappen
but
they
only
accompanied
us
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
they
all
departed
except
the
three
men
who
remained
to
manage
the
ponies
the
pace
was
not
very
great
about
a
mile
an
hour
for
these
little
ponies
insisted
on
stopping
to
rest
every
hundred
yards
when
the
path
was
good
and
every
twenty
when
it
was
bad
we
followed
the
river
till
we
crossed
the
slangen
bridge
after
that
the
path
began
to
rise
and
get
rapidly
worse
we
strolled
along
very
leisurely
sitting
down
from
time
to
time
to
rest
and
admire
the
view
the
scenery
was
occasionally
very
beautiful
with
the
jotun
mountains
gleaming
white
in
the
background
and
the
forest
itself
was
an
endless
delight
with
its
hoary
pine
trees
and
carpet
of
plants
and
the
delicious
odours
with
which
a
norwegian
forest
in
summer
always
abounds
in
a
fir
tree
here
esau
came
upon
a
family
of
cole
titmice
and
another
of
creepers
all
very
busy
swinging
themselves
about
and
creeping
up
and
down
the
tree
in
search
of
dinner
they
appeared
to
take
a
certain
amount
of
interest
in
his
proceedings
but
showed
no
fear
and
after
watching
them
a
long
time
he
put
the
point
of
his
rod
up
to
one
of
the
titmice
which
actually
pecked
it
rather
angrily
but
seeing
that
it
made
no
impression
took
no
further
notice
but
returned
to
its
occupation
of
collecting
food
in
the
next
tree
was
a
little
spotted
woodpecker
which
they
call
a
gertrude
the
story
is
so
prettily
told
in
forest
life
in
norway
and
sweden
that
it
shall
be
inserted
here
this
woodpecker
or
an
ancestor
of
hers
was
once
a
woman
and
one
day
she
was
kneading
bread
in
her
trough
under
the
eaves
of
her
house
when
our
lord
passed
by
leaning
on
peter
she
did
not
know
it
was
our
lord
and
his
apostle
for
they
looked
like
two
poor
men
who
were
travelling
past
her
cottage
door
give
us
of
your
dough
for
the
love
of
god
said
the
lord
we
have
come
far
across
the
fjeld
and
have
fasted
gertrude
pinched
off
a
small
piece
for
them
but
on
rolling
it
in
the
trough
to
get
it
into
shape
it
grew
and
grew
and
filled
up
the
trough
completely
no
said
she
that
is
more
than
you
want
so
she
pinched
off
a
smaller
piece
and
rolled
it
out
as
before
but
the
smaller
piece
filled
up
the
trough
just
as
the
other
had
done
and
gertrude
put
it
aside
too
and
pinched
a
smaller
bit
still
but
the
miracle
was
just
the
same
the
smaller
bit
filled
up
the
trough
as
full
as
the
largest
sized
kneading
that
she
had
ever
put
into
it
gertrude
s
heart
was
hardened
still
more
she
put
that
aside
too
resolving
as
soon
as
the
stranger
left
her
to
divide
all
her
dough
into
little
bits
and
to
roll
it
out
into
great
loaves
i
can
not
give
you
any
said
she
go
on
your
journey
the
lord
prosper
you
but
you
must
not
stop
at
my
then
the
lord
christ
was
angry
and
her
eyes
were
opened
and
she
saw
whom
she
had
forbidden
to
come
into
the
house
and
she
fell
down
on
her
knees
but
the
lord
said
i
gave
you
plenty
but
that
hardened
your
heart
so
plenty
was
not
a
blessing
to
you
i
will
try
you
now
with
the
blessing
of
poverty
you
shall
from
henceforth
seek
your
food
day
by
day
and
always
between
the
wood
and
the
bark
alluding
to
the
custom
of
mixing
the
inner
rind
of
the
birch
with
their
in
times
of
scarcity
but
forasmuch
as
i
see
your
penitence
is
sincere
this
shall
not
be
for
ever
as
soon
as
your
back
is
entirely
clothed
with
mourning
this
shall
cease
for
by
that
time
you
will
have
learnt
to
use
your
gifts
gertrude
flew
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
for
she
was
already
a
bird
but
her
feathers
were
even
now
blackened
from
her
mourning
and
from
that
time
forward
she
and
her
descendants
have
all
the
year
round
sought
their
food
between
the
wood
and
the
bark
but
the
feathers
of
their
back
and
wings
get
more
mottled
with
black
as
they
grow
older
and
when
the
white
is
quite
covered
the
lord
takes
them
for
his
own
again
no
norwegian
will
ever
hurt
a
gertrude
bird
for
she
is
always
under
the
lord
s
protection
though
he
is
punishing
her
for
the
whether
this
is
the
true
reason
or
not
the
fact
remains
that
the
bird
is
never
harmed
by
any
one
and
is
as
tame
as
possible
we
continued
climbing
slowly
up
the
hill
till
about
one
o
clock
when
we
came
out
above
the
forest
on
an
open
plateau
covered
with
rocks
grass
and
low
scrub
this
was
the
fjeld
at
finböle
sæter
we
stopped
to
refresh
on
milk
the
road
which
had
gradually
dwindled
from
a
decent
path
to
a
sleigh
track
then
a
footpath
a
and
a
just
sufficient
to
swear
by
or
at
now
lost
itself
altogether
the
men
had
been
complaining
that
it
was
a
dole
vei
bad
road
soon
after
the
start
now
they
said
it
was
schlamm
a
very
expressive
word
and
esau
agreed
with
them
and
said
it
was
damm
schlamm
which
does
not
sound
like
proper
norsk
but
it
was
such
work
to
see
our
beloved
canoes
bumping
and
jolting
along
every
moment
in
imminent
danger
of
getting
staved
in
that
to
indulge
in
a
few
such
norwegian
idioms
was
only
human
and
we
decided
to
walk
on
and
spare
ourselves
the
agony
of
the
sight
so
taking
the
bearings
of
fly
sæter
which
was
our
destination
for
the
evening
we
rambled
on
across
the
fjeld
a
splendid
walk
with
some
of
the
most
beautiful
mountains
in
norway
all
round
us
we
got
on
very
well
with
the
assistance
of
an
ordnance
map
and
compass
till
we
came
to
the
river
hinögle
after
passing
hinögelid
sæter
the
bridge
here
was
not
in
the
place
marked
on
the
map
so
that
after
crossing
it
we
had
some
trouble
in
finding
fly
sæter
and
might
perhaps
have
perished
miserably
like
the
babes
in
the
wood
had
we
not
opportunely
met
a
mediæval
fisherman
in
a
red
looking
like
one
of
the
demons
in
rip
van
winkle
who
was
going
thither
and
conducted
us
we
arrived
at
seven
o
clock
and
appeased
our
hunger
with
the
usual
meal
of
trout
and
coffee
and
cream

sunset
at
fly
sæter
the
sæter
was
a
long
low
house
with
three
little
rooms
and
only
two
windows
its
legitimate
tenants
were
a
very
nice
man
and
his
equally
nice
wife
and
three
children
but
there
were
some
occasional
visitors
here
in
the
shape
of
ourselves
our
three
men
the
mediæval
angler
and
another
traveller
twelve
altogether
to
be
apportioned
among
four
beds
and
to
make
matters
worse
the
rooms
were
continually
invaded
by
sheep
pigs
and
goats
of
which
there
were
a
large
stock
the
norwegians
are
so
uniformly
kind
to
all
their
animals
that
their
tameness
is
really
troublesome
they
insist
on
going
where
they
like
and
following
one
about
begging
for
food
like
dogs
causing
the
skipper
to
exclaim
ite
domum
saturæ
venit
hesperus
ite
capellæ
which
he
translated
out
of
the
house

the

we
slept
in
the
very
comfortably
one
on
the
floor
the
other
on
a
good
hay
bed
and
were
warm
for
the
first
time
for
several
nights
as
we
have
not
had
sufficient
blankets
in
the
tent
where
the
other
ten
people
slept
we
did
not
inquire
but
hoped
they
were
happy
our
men
and
sleighs
did
not
arrive
till
at
which
time
a
most
glorious
sunset
was
going
on
so
that
we
could
not
attend
to
them
at
once
the
sky
at
first
blue
and
yellow
gradually
deepened
into
purple
and
orange
and
finally
the
most
brilliant
red
and
almost
black
clouds
the
hills
all
the
time
glowing
with
exquisite
tints
after
it
was
concluded
we
turned
to
the
men
and
were
much
delighted
to
find
that
nothing
was
smashed
so
far
the
men
had
been
very
careful
and
took
eleven
hours
to
perform
a
journey
of
ten
miles
chapter

fly
sæter
the
morning
was
again
beautifully
fine
and
the
coffee
at
the
sæter
was
passing
delicious
even
for
this
country
where
coffee
is
always
good
no
doubt
the
chief
reason
of
this
is
that
it
is
never
roasted
and
ground
till
just
when
it
is
wanted
not
only
at
the
hotels
but
at
the
smallest
sæters
the
grinding
of
coffee
and
the
frying
of
trout
are
grateful
sounds
to
the
wearied
traveller
and
if
the
walk
across
the
fjeld
has
failed
to
give
him
an
appetite
he
has
still
the
chance
of
obtaining
one
from
the
fragrant
aroma
of
the
roasting
berry
this
sæter
is
in
a
most
beautiful
situation
perched
on
a
little
flat
bit
of
ground
on
the
mountain
side
and
looking
down
on
a
sea
of
grey
undulating
hills
with
lakes
lying
among
them
dotted
about
near
and
far
and
all
the
lower
ground
covered
with
the
everlasting
pine
forest
to
the
south
can
be
seen
the
river
hinögle
which
runs
out
of
the
heimdal
lakes
threading
its
way
with
gleams
of
white
through
the
dark
green
and
grey
of
the

aakre

is
a
lake
that
we
had
intended
to
fish
after
slangen

but
as
there
seemed
to
be
no
possibility
of
getting
our
property
from
one
to
the
other
we
gave
up
the
notion
according
to
all
accounts
it
is
a
good
lake
for
fish
and
its
shores
are
untainted
by
the
habitations
of
man
we
started
about
having
paid
for
the
board
and
lodging
of
ourselves
and
our
numerous
retinue
including
the
price
of
a
of
hay
for
our
beds
as
this
was
the
last
place
at
which
we
expected
we
could
get
any
after
watching
for
a
short
time
our
valuables
jolting
plunging
and
splashing
over
the
uneven
ground
covered
with
rocks
junipers
and
occasional
logs
and
brooks
the
wear
and
tear
on
our
became
too
severe
and
we
decided
to
walk
on
to
sikkildals
sæter
about
four
miles
and
leave
the
baggage
to
its
fate
under
the
guidance
of
our
three
charioteers
it
took
us
till
eleven
o
clock
to
get
within
half
a
mile
of
the
sæter
and
there
we
sat
down
and
watched
the
track
intently
for
two
hours
then
two
hours
more
and
we
began
to
lose
patience
then
another
hour
and
we
began
to
lose
hope
also
something
must
have
happened
either
a
canoe
was
smashed
or
washed
away
crossing
a
stream
or
one
of
the
sleighs
was
upset
and
broken
or
they
were
bogged
or
the
man
carrying
the
bag
had
fainted
or
his
pony
become
unmanageable
and
dashed
through
a
shop
window
or
most
dreadful
thought
the
men
had
got
at
our
whisky
and
become
hopelessly
drunk
illustration
desperate
conflict
between
esau
and
the
mosquito
another
hour
passed
and
our
small
remaining
stock
of
good
temper
went
we
were
very
hungry
and
all
our
food
was
on
the
sleighs
and
the
mosquitoes
seemed
to
be
even
more
hungry
than
we
were
hope
deferred
with
nothing
but
mosquitoes
to
distract
one
s
thoughts
maketh
the
heart
very
sick
indeed
and
these
were
most
annoyingly
large
mosquitoes
the
finest
brand
that
we
have
yet
inspected
and
with
more
strength
of
character
than
the
ordinary
kind
we
were
so
much
annoyed
with
the
world
in
general
and
each
other
that
we
were
obliged
to
separate
and
esau
retired
for
a
short
time
to
attempt
a
sketch
he
came
back
very
angry
because
just
at
the
critical
moment
a
mosquito
had
knocked
his
hat
off
and
he
had
had
a
desperate
and
perspiring
conflict
with
it
under
a
tropical
sun
but
eventually
the
brute
was
vanquished
and
its
head
cut
off
which
he
said
he
would
have
stuffed
to
hang
up
in
his
ancestral
halls
he
certainly
bore
on
his
face
the
marks
of
the
struggle
so
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
reason
to
doubt
the
story
plate
on
the
track
near
sikkildals
lake
our
state
of
despondency
waxed
worse
and
worse
we
had
not
the
slightest
confidence
in
our
head
driver
he
was
undoubtedly
the
svatsum
village
fool
for
he
talked
all
day
and
the
other
men
went
into
roars
of
laughter
at
whatever
he
said
though
the
skipper
said
couldn
t
see
anything
funny
in
most
of
his
remarks
but
possibly
the
skipper
was
jealous
because
this
man
made
better
norsk
jokes
than
his
own
besides
this
the
fact
that
neither
of
us
understood
the
language
detracted
from
the
merits
of
the
jests
years
rolled
away
and
at
six
o
clock
something
came
slowly
into
sight
out
with
the
glass
the
yes
by
george
it
is
the
men
and
sleighs
at
last
out
with
the
other
glass
and
we
finish
the
wee
drappie
that
we
were
saving
to
the
last
extremity
they
soon
arrived
at
sikkildal
sæter
with
us
and
we
found
that
nothing
had
gone
wrong
but
the
men
had
been
careful
and
so
had
taken
nine
hours
to
make
a
journey
of
four
miles
the
track
certainly
would
be
a
disgrace
to
a
metropolitan
vestry
and
they
managed
well
to
arrive
with
everything
uninjured
we
consider
the
village
fool
to
be
a
most
painstaking
and
praiseworthy
idiot
at
sikkildal
sæter
we
got
some
food
and
called
at
a
small
house
close
to
it
where
a
a
norwegian
barrister
was
staying
for
the
summer
he
is
the
owner
of
the
sikkildal
lakes
and
we
wanted
permission
to
camp
on
his
land
and
fish
in
his
lakes
he
understood
english
as
well
as
all
the
upper
classes
in
norway
do
and
was
very
civil
giving
us
the
permission
most
willingly
we
have
heard
from
a
good
many
people
that
the
wealthier
norwegians
do
not
like
the
english
and
will
not
do
anything
to
oblige
them
but
in
all
our
wanderings
we
have
met
with
nothing
but
the
greatest
kindness
and
hospitality
from
all
classes
several
people
have
gone
out
of
their
way
to
voluntarily
offer
fishing
and
shooting
and
in
no
instance
has
the
slightest
incivility
been
shown
certainly
norway
will
compare
with
england
very
much
to
advantage
in
this
respect
though
of
course
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
similar
conduct
would
be
possible
in
england
at
about
seven
in
the
evening
we
got
all
our
cargo
shipped
again
and
started
up
the
lower
sikkildals
lake
having
first
paid
our
charioteers
for
the
trip
from
olstappen
three
men
horses
and
sleighs
sixteen
miles
over
the
rockiest
brookiest
and
juniperiest
country
in
this
world
and
offered
them
whisky
and
water
all
round
including
two
men
from
the
sæter
who
came
to
our
assistance
when
the
smallest
pony
not
being
accustomed
to
the
deceitfulness
and
treacherous
wiles
of
this
life
got
up
to
its
neck
in
a
bog
close
to
the
lake
and
the
man
with
the
bag
followed
it
however
they
were
extricated
with
no
damage
done
as
our
provisions
were
all
securely
soldered
up
in
tins
curious
to
relate
our
three
men
did
not
like
whisky
but
just
sipped
for
manners
and
only
the
two
old
men
from
the
sæter
would
drink
it
but
these
two
old
men
liked
it
very
much
and
drank
all
they
could
get
that
is
to
say
their
own
glasses
full
and
the
other
fellows
glasses
full
and
just
a
drop
after
that
and
then
just
a
taste
to
top
up
with
then
we
shook
hands
all
round
and
feeling
in
charity
with
all
men
sailed
joyously
away
up
the
lake
it
was
a
real
norwegian
night
with
the
warmth
and
light
of
the
departed
sun
still
lingering
on
the
mountain
tops
and
a
midnight
twilight
glowing
in
the
valleys
we
had
a
beautiful
full
moon
to
help
us
on
our
way
so
we
went
right
to
the
upper
end
of
the
first
lake
and
found
a
halfway
between
the
two
lakes
which
are
about
a
hundred
yards
apart
the
portage
took
us
some
time
but
we
were
full
of
energy
from
the
cool
night
air
so
refreshing
after
the
long
hot
summer
day
we
dug
out
a
nice
level
place
for
the
tent
and
got
everything
settled
and
ourselves
in
bed
about
midnight
chapter
ix
sikkildal
july
we
arose
soon
after
seven
not
because
it
is
our
nature
to
get
up
at
that
time
still
less
because
we
think
it
our
duty
to
do
so
but
because
the
sun
made
the
tent
so
intolerably
hot
that
there
was
no
pleasure
to
be
derived
from
staying
in
bed
any
longer
naturally
after
this
we
were
very
cross
which
the
skipper
says
all
really
pious
people
are
on
sunday
morning
and
he
abused
esau
shamefully
because
the
latter
wanted
the
eggs
buttered
and
the
skipper
wanted
them
fried
esau
laid
down
the
axiom
that
no
gentleman
ever
eats
fried
eggs
in
a
peculiarly
offensive
manner
and
proceeded
further
to
make
remarks
with
reference
to
violet
ink
and
the
skipper
retorted
with
the
observation
wish
you
d
brought
that
anchovy
esau
why
skipper
because
it
s
just
the
stuff
to
grease
your
boots
with
in
a
place
like
this
smells
strongish
and
keeps
the
mosquitoes
at
a
altogether
we
made
ourselves
as
disagreeable
as
possible
to
each
other
just
as
we
do
in
our
happy
homes
on
the
sabbath
morn
in
england
fortunately
sunday
only
comes
once
a
week
breakfast
over
the
skipper
devoted
himself
to
the
occupation
of
greasing
his
boots
and
shaving
which
he
seems
to
do
at
the
same
time
so
that
one
brush
may
be
used
for
both
the
soap
and
the
grease
while
esau
did
some
washing
we
had
some
trouble
in
getting
good
firewood
for
sikkildals
vand
is
more
than
three
thousand
feet
above
sea
level
and
consequently
we
were
above
the
region
of
pine
forests
and
had
only
the
stunted
birch
and
juniper
from
which
to
obtain
our
supply
we
divide
the
altitudes
rather
differently
from
the
system
adopted
by
other
great
explorers
the
lowest
belt
is
that
of
pine
forests
and
strawberries
then
comes
the
zone
of
stunted
birches
above
that
only
juniper
and
bitter
willow
are
found
and
the
highest
belt
of
vegetation
contains
only
rocks
and
moss
and
then
eternal
snow
now
birch
trees
do
not
make
good
firewood
for
when
they
die
they
appear
to
get
and
never
burn
well
the
juniper
is
the
most
invaluable
of
all
trees
for
it
will
burn
quite
green
but
at
sikkildals
vand
it
is
very
scarce
and
so
it
took
us
quite
a
long
time
to
collect
enough
dry
wood
to
last
our
stay
out
but
it
was
done
at
last
we
carried
one
canoe
across
the
spit
of
land
between
the
two
lakes
and
in
it
the
skipper
went
forth
to
get
fish
for
the
larder
while
esau
took
the
other
canoe
down
the
lower
lake
to
get
some
milk
from
sikkildals
sæter
the
scenery
here
is
very
fine
the
lakes
are
narrow
and
highish
mountains
rise
on
each
side
those
on
the
south
side
had
snow
upon
them
though
this
would
disappear
before
the
end
of
the
summer
as
we
are
not
yet
in
the
regions
of
perpetual
snow
on
the
north
side
there
is
a
very
remarkable
mountain
called
sikkildals
horn
with
a
perfectly
impracticable
front
of
overhanging
rock
very
high
and
rugged
there
was
a
constant
rumbling
and
booming
proceeding
from
it
as
rocks
from
time
to
time
broke
off
and
came
crashing
down
but
our
tent
though
seemingly
under
this
cliff
was
well
out
of
their
reach
at
the
further
end
of
the
upper
lake
we
could
see
an
apparently
impassable
mountain
ridge
beyond
this
about
four
miles
further
according
to
the
maps
was
besse
sæter
a
farm
or
ranch
only
one
day
s
journey
from
our
final
how
we
were
to
cross
that
mountain
with
our
canoes
and
baggage
was
a
matter
only
to
be
determined
by
prophets
and
other
beings
of
a
higher
order
of
intelligence
than
ours
our
friend
thought
it
was
almost
impossible
the
skipper
boldly
asserted
that
it
impossible
and
requested
to
be
allowed
to
die
here
while
esau
with
the
sanguine
joyousness
begotten
of
total
ignorance
said
of
course
it
could
be
managed
we
determined
to
move
to
the
end
of
the
lake
the
next
day
and
try
the
pass
on
the
one
following
barring
earthquakes
esau
had
a
most
interesting
voyage
his
fishing
was
not
very
successful
at
first
and
he
paddled
steadily
on
towards
the
sæter
overtaking
a
boat
quite
full
of
girls
dressed
in
the
very
picturesque
native
costume
which
the
people
in
these
primitive
regions
still
adhere
to
especially
on
sundays
the
girls
about
here
are
rather
pretty
than
otherwise
and
these
were
a
particularly
good
selection
and
of
course
all
in
their
cleanest
and
smartest
clothes
for
sunday
they
stop
to
watch
him
fishing
till
he
got
quite
shy
and
gave
up
throwing
till
they
rowed
on
illustration
sæter
girls
in
a
boat
on
sikkildals
lake
soon
he
came
to
a
brood
of
pochards
under
the
leadership
of
the
old
duck
and
spent
half
an
hour
trying
to
capture
one
by
rapid
paddling
in
which
endeavour
he
was
nearly
but
not
quite
successful
there
were
a
good
many
teal
and
pochards
on
the
lower
lake
and
plenty
of
sandpipers
on
the
shores
of
the
upper
one
at
last
he
reached
the
sæter
and
found
there
all
the
girls
of
the
boat
and
at
least
another
and
five
or
six
strangers
quite
a
crowd
possibly
they
had
been
having
a
church
service
but
probably
not
as
they
all
seemed
in
the
best
of
tempers
and
were
most
amiable
he
got
the
milk
and
coming
back
tried
a
few
casts
and
found
that
the
fish
were
rising
properly
the
result
was
nineteen
good
trout
in
about
an
hour
and
a
half
we
had
not
been
catching
many
fish
lately
so
after
his
return
to
camp
we
concluded
that
this
was
the
hour
and
we
were
the
men
to
revel
in
a
fiendish
glut
of
capture
so
there
was
a
regular
stampede
in
that
camp
and
after
dinner
we
went
out
armed
to
the
teeth
with
rods
and
and
clothed
in
landing
nets
and
freke
bags
with
our
teeth
firmly
set
and
a
bloodthirsty
look
in
our
eyes
intending
to
struggle
with
the
great
trout
in
his
native
element
or
perish
in
the
attempt
about
ten
o
clock
that
night
there
might
have
been
seen
toiling
wearily
back
to
camp
under
a
cloudy
sky
and
with
a
chilly
blast
two
forlorn
youths
sans
fish
sans
hope
but
still
armed
to
the
teeth
with
the
weapons
of
the
chase
however
we
had
now
tried
both
lakes
and
got
some
knowledge
of
their
capabilities
the
upper
one
is
we
think
the
better
of
the
two
but
more
difficult
to
catch
fish
in
the
skipper
got
some
in
it
and
they
were
larger
fish
than
those
of
the
lower
lake
and
a
different
sort
more
like
the
silvery
trout
of
the
jotunfjeld
whereas
the
others
are
the
ordinary
brown
or
yellow
trout
this
afternoon
and
his
wife
with
a
friend
came
up
in
a
boat
to
see
our
camp
at
which
they
seemed
much
pleased
we
took
them
short
cruises
in
the
canoes
showed
them
our
various
arrangements
and
endeavoured
to
be
agreeable
the
friend
was
the
manager
of
the
government
stud
for
this
district
and
spoke
english
fairly
he
told
us
that
the
government
provides
a
certain
number
of
good
stallions
which
are
turned
out
on
the
fjeld
and
run
with
the
peasants
mares
and
that
they
take
great
trouble
to
provide
the
best
that
can
be
got
so
as
to
improve
the
breed
he
considered
that
there
are
very
decidedly
good
results
a
beautiful
fishing
morning
just
beginning
to
blow
up
for
rain
the
skipper
fished
his
way
down
to
the
sæter
for
more
provisions
and
had
sport
catching
beautiful
fish
mostly
over
a
pound
he
had
such
an
exciting
time
of
it
that
lunch
was
forgotten
till
three
o
clock
a
fact
which
spoke
volumes
for
the
excellence
of
the
sport
for
we
generally
acquire
a
very
keen
appetite
every
three
or
four
hours
so
long
as
the
sun
is
performing
his
daily
duty
of
standing
still
while
we
circulate
feebly
round
ourselves
he
came
back
to
the
tent
presenting
rather
a
distended
appearance
having
stuffed
most
of
his
pockets
full
of
potatoes
and
a
packet
of
salt
in
his
hat
and
while
with
his
right
hand
he
folded
to
his
bosom
a
bottle
of
cream
and
another
of
milk
in
his
left
he
grasped
a
rod
a
landing
net
and
paddle
and
the
rest
of
him
was
hung
with
fish
the
skipper
objects
to
making
two
journeys
where
only
one
is
necessary
esau
thinks
that
is
a
necessary
of
life
so
he
took
his
gun
up
the
upper
lake
and
returned
with
the
noble
spoil
of
five
sandpipers
which
he
had
shot
out
of
the
canoe
by
creeping
along
the
edge
of
the
lake
a
most
entertaining
pastime
there
is
an
old
ruined
fisherman
s
hut
at
our
end
of
the
lake
and
this
had
apparently
been
taken
as
a
habitation
by
a
family
of
stoats
which
esau
espied
at
their
gambols
on
his
return
cartridges
are
precious
here
but
the
instinct
of
destruction
of
a
stoat
was
too
much
for
him
and
having
chirped
till
two
of
them
stood
close
together
and
a
third
just
behind
he
fired
into
the
crowd
and
mortally
injured
the
lot
poor
little
things
it
is
rather
a
shame
to
kill
them
for
there
is
so
little
game
that
they
can
not
do
much
harm
probably
feeding
chiefly
on
mice
and
lemmings
which
are
very
numerous
and
they
always
look
uncommonly
pretty
playing
about
the
rocks
no
more
graceful
animal
exists
than
a
stoat
after
dinner
had
been
cooked
and
despatched
we
went
forth
to
fish
again
and
had
some
good
sport
but
presently
lowering
clouds
settled
down
over
the
surface
of
the
deep
mosquitoes
gathered
round
us
in
swarms
and
a
few
spots
of
rain
drove
us
home
to
the
snug
retreat
of
the
tent
where
hidden
away
under
the
warmth
of
our
bedding
we
smoked
in
thoughtful
silence
and
gloated
over
the
day
s
doings
and
our
larder
stocked
with
fishes
the
day
commenced
with
showers
and
as
there
are
no
inhabitants
here
to
whom
we
can
give
the
surplus
fish
we
did
not
like
to
catch
any
more
for
it
is
against
our
principles
to
waste
food
wilfully
woeful
want
being
too
near
and
probable
a
state
to
be
trifled
with
consequently
we
determined
to
move
on
but
first
to
bake
some
bread
this
in
a
temporary
camp
is
done
by
putting
the
kneaded
dough
into
a
tin
pot
made
on
purpose
without
solder
this
pot
is
then
placed
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
in
which
we
have
previously
kept
a
good
fire
for
about
half
an
hour
before
putting
the
pot
in
all
the
embers
and
ashes
are
cleared
out
and
then
raked
back
on
to
the
top
of
the
tin
and
all
round
it
and
a
small
fire
is
kept
going
on
the
top
if
well
managed
this
bakes
excellent
bread
in
about
twenty
minutes
but
of
course
it
requires
considerable
experience
and
care
to
turn
out
really
satisfactory
bread
when
we
get
to
our
permanent
camp
we
shall
make
a
proper
oven
when
we
had
baked
successfully
packed
up
our
things
and
were
taking
advantage
of
a
break
between
the
showers
to
start
we
were
hailed
from
the
bank
and
saw
there
old
peter
tronhūus
the
tenant
of
besse
sæter
whither
we
are
going
and
father
of
jens
tronhūus
our
former
hunter
who
is
now
getting
what
we
require
in
the
shape
of
food
ponies
and
men
and
whom
we
expect
to
meet
at
besse
sæter
peter
had
a
great
deal
to
tell
us
about
all
our
affairs
which
seem
to
be
prospering
under
jens
auspices
he
talks
english
very
badly
so
the
interview
lasted
some
time
and
then
we
pushed
off
and
paddled
straight
away
to
the
extreme
end
of
the
lake
where
we
found
an
inferior
place
to
pitch
the
tent
very
damp
and
unwholesome
in
appearance
sadly
in
need
of
sanitary
inspection
but
no
doubt
good
enough
for
one
night
we
fished
with
fly
and
minnow
all
the
way
but
took
nothing
there
being
a
good
deal
of
thunder
round
about
but
esau
shot
some
more
sandpipers
our
tent
is
pitched
at
the
commencement
of
an
extremely
vague
track
which
we
believe
to
go
over
our
mountain
pass
to
sjödals
vand
pronounced
shoodals
and
we
hope
to
follow
its
wanderings
if
two
men
and
horses
with
whom
we
have
made
an
arrangement
to
transport
us
turn
up
these
two
men
and
horses
are
the
sole
inhabitants
of
this
very
thinly
populated
district
so
that
we
are
at
their
mercy
and
if
they
do
not
come
we
must
inevitably
die
of
starvation
after
we
have
eaten
all
our
provisions
and
candles
late
in
the
evening
herr
b
and
a
scientific
friend
who
had
just
come
to
stay
with
him
came
down
the
mountain
to
our
tent
they
had
been
for
a
short
walking
tour
to
lake
gjendin
our
future
goal
where
it
seems
that
a
tourist
s
hut
of
a
superior
sort
has
lately
been
built
and
at
this
hut
several
kinds
of
food
are
kept
such
as
tinned
meats
and
beer
b
and
his
friend
have
therefore
been
there
shopping
the
news
of
this
hut
is
rather
unpleasant
to
us
for
gjendin
was
chosen
chiefly
for
its
wildness
and
remoteness
from
civilisation
and
now
we
are
haunted
with
the
idea
that
there
may
be
tourists
and
consequently
no
fish
or
reindeer
on
the
other
hand
it
has
been
erected
so
short
a
time
that
it
can
hardly
have
affected
the
country
round
about
yet
and
it
will
certainly
be
convenient
for
us
from
a
commissariat
point
of
view
we
were
just
beginning
supper
when
they
arrived
but
they
would
not
stop
for
which
we
were
secretly
glad
as
there
was
only
enough
soup
for
two
so
we
had
a
whisky
skaal
instead
and
they
went
on
their
way
full
of
beans
and
benevolence
as
jorrocks
hath
it
we
whisky
every
one
who
turns
up
at
camp
and
as
a
rule
they
like
it
we
are
not
much
of
drunkards
ourselves
so
we
can
afford
to
give
it
to
other
people
chapter
besse
sæter
our
two
men
arrived
while
we
were
at
breakfast
this
morning
and
brought
two
sleighs
in
the
boat
with
them
these
they
deposited
on
the
shore
and
then
one
of
them
departed
into
some
secret
haunt
of
his
own
in
search
of
a
horse
the
last
we
saw
of
him
was
a
wee
dot
struggling
up
over
the
mountain
crest
and
we
began
to
feel
what
a
hopeless
sort
of
task
was
before
us
when
we
had
finished
our
breakfast
there
were
certain
remnants
of
food
and
these
we
offered
to
the
other
man
because
he
seemed
to
want
something
to
do
we
left
him
in
the
tent
with
a
containing
two
trout
fried
in
butter
and
a
tin
pot
nearly
full
of
soup
some
time
afterwards
we
looked
in
and
saw
him
eating
greedily
off
his
and
after
a
further
interval
we
noticed
that
he
had
finished
then
we
examined
the
culinary
utensils
out
of
which
he
had
been
feeding
and
found
he
had
left
the
trout
untouched
but
the
butter
they
were
fried
in
he
had
utterly
consumed
off
the
blade
of
his
knife
and
also
all
the
soup
through
the
same
medium
but
there
was
not
more
than
a
gallon
and
a
half
of
the
latter
so
we
did
not
grudge
it
illustration
old
siva
carrying
a
canoe
up
the
sikkildals
pass
apparently
he
was
like
a
giant
refreshed
after
his
meal
and
seizing
one
canoe
he
carried
it
up
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
then
came
back
for
the
other
and
did
the
same
with
it
after
this
he
returned
again
and
borrowed
our
axe
saying
he
wanted
to
make
the
path
better
for
the
sleigh
he
disappeared
among
the
stunted
birches
and
we
heard
him
chopping
and
slowly
getting
further
up
the
track
for
about
an
hour
we
naturally
supposed
that
he
was
clearing
away
trees
that
obstructed
the
path
but
when
we
came
to
traverse
that
path
ourselves
soon
afterwards
we
discovered
that
he
had
only
been
filling
up
holes
in
the
road
by
felling
trees
across
it
now
a
road
that
can
be
improved
by
this
process
is
in
a
very
bad
state
and
this
one
was
decidedly
improved
just
before
we
started
an
english
tourist
came
down
the
mountain
and
arranged
with
siva
one
of
our
men
to
go
down
the
lake
in
his
boat
he
was
the
first
of
our
whom
we
have
seen
since
lillehammer
and
proved
to
be
the
only
one
we
met
all
through
our
trip
in
the
mountains
after
some
time
we
perceived
three
dots
wending
their
way
down
the
path
again
and
presently
they
arrived
proving
to
be
our
other
man
and
two
extremely
shaggy
ponies
and
after
the
complicated
norwegian
harness
had
been
put
on
we
began
the
ascent
the
path
was
as
bad
as
bad
could
be
for
a
short
distance
but
when
the
level
was
reached
it
became
much
better
than
we
had
had
hitherto
it
was
only
the
first
climb
up
from
the
lake
that
presented
any
difficulty
the
canoes
could
only
have
been
transported
as
they
were
on
a
man
s
back
it
continued
showery
but
we
had
a
very
pleasant
walk
and
launched
our
canoes
on
sjödals
vand
at
about
three
o
clock
a
short
paddle
across
the
lake
not
more
than
three
quarters
of
a
mile
and
we
were
at
besse
sæter
sjödals
vand
is
a
long
straggling
lake
very
much
exposed
to
the
wind
and
not
in
any
way
beautiful
except
for
its
wildness
as
its
shores
are
almost
treeless
and
rather
flat
its
most
remarkable
characteristic
is
the
colour
of
its
water
which
is
a
light
greenish
blue
like
a
starling
s
egg
and
stands
out
in
striking
contrast
against
the
yellow
shore
and
dark
mountain
heights
which
surround
it
besse
sæter
is
only
three
miles
from
gjendin
vand
the
haven
where
we
would
be
and
the
mountains
which
have
been
gradually
getting
nearer
all
the
way
from
olstappen
are
now
magnificently
towering
above
us
on
three
sides
the
sæter
is
a
hut
built
as
they
all
are
entirely
of
wood
and
only
inhabited
during
the
summer
months
the
hut
in
which
we
are
living
is
not
strictly
speaking
a
sæter
at
all
but
has
been
built
for
the
convenience
of
travellers
and
the
tronhūus
family
are
entrusted
with
the
duty
of
taking
care
of
those
who
come
hither
while
wandering
about
this
the
wildest
and
grandest
part
of
norway
the
real
sæter
is
a
larger
building
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
this
hut
and
higher
up
the
mountain
and
further
away
still
there
is
yet
another
building
or
collection
of
buildings
also
called
besse
sæter
our
hut
has
three
rooms
two
of
which
a
bedroom
and
are
occupied
at
present
solely
by
us
in
the
other
room
dwell
two
girls
apparently
guests
of
the
tronhūus
peter
tronhūus
himself
and
his
numerous
family
live
in
a
hut
just
opposite
this
at
present
the
family
appears
to
consist
of
two
men
five
women
and
two
children
relationship
to
each
other
unknown
peter
and
his
son
jens
who
was
with
us
on
a
former
expedition
are
both
away
at
present
the
latter
engaged
in
procuring
various
articles
for
us
such
as
potatoes
men
ponies
and
dogs
about
which
we
wrote
to
him
from
england
and
he
is
expected
back
in
spite
of
the
crowd
of
people
living
here
everything
is
beautifully
clean
and
tidy
and
our
looks
very
nice
with
its
floor
always
covered
with
fresh
juniper
sprays
and
a
cheerful
fire
burning
in
that
most
charming
of
fireplaces
the
primitive
norwegian
which
is
being
rapidly
superseded
everywhere
by
horrid
tall
black
iron
stoves
that
look
like
coffins
set
up
on
end
and
smell
like
and
rosin
when
they
are
lighted
we
shall
have
to
make
this
place
our
home
until
jens
turns
up
and
we
are
not
at
all
sorry
to
do
so
for
they
take
the
greatest
trouble
to
make
us
comfortable
and
the
trout
fladbrod
and
coffee
are
simply
perfection
besides
we
are
only
a
short
day
s
journey
from
memurudalen
where
we
intend
to
camp
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
getting
there
before
august
the
opening
day
of
the
reindeer
season
after
supper
we
sallied
out
the
skipper
with
rod
esau
with
gun
to
see
what
we
could
catch
esau
landed
on
the
marsh
at
the
head
of

sjödals

not

that
is
carried
on
in
the
summer
by
the
dwellers
in

nevertheless
there
are
good

we
have
seen
many

end

exactly
to
this
morning
but
the
arrival
of
jens
encouraged
us
and
esau
walked
outside
to
look
at
the
sky
where
thrusting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
lodging
an
in
his
eye
he
focussed
the
heavens
generally
with
a
cruel
inquisitive
stare
and
shaking
his
head
knowingly
indulged
in
a
prophecy
concerning
the
weather
that
the
wind
now
being
in
the
west
there
would
be
continuous
sunshine
for
three
weeks
at
then
he
walked
in
again
and
we
all
shivered
over
the
fire
jens
arrived
at
and
after
greetings
had
been
exchanged
reported
all
his
achievements
on

he
had
secured
for
us
a

seems
likely
to
be
a

a

is
always
bemoaning
the
law

is
suspected
that

has
a
large
collection
of
useless
animals
there
that
he
wishes
to
import
into
norway

sell
to
the

have
now
accumulated

in

were
wet
through

we
have
now
the
inexpressible
consolation
of
knowing
that
they
are
in
worse

for
we
have
received
our
first
batch
of
letters
and
papers
from

which
have
been
a
fortnight
prophets
are
without
honour
in
these
parts
they
are
also
without
truth
honesty
or
any
good
quality
or
proper
feeling
this
day
is
worse
than
usual
and
the
good
people
here
have
been
going
about
with
blanched
cheeks
whispering
with
bated
breath
of
a
great
flood
which
occurred
in
the
time
of
one
noah
we
spent
all
the
morning
trying
to
teach
the
cows
goats
and
poultry
to
walk
two
and
two
in
case
of
any
emergency
arising
and
the
skipper
who
was
engaged
in
building
what
he
called
a
nark
was
repeatedly
coming
into
the
sæter
to
ask
how
many
yards
there
were
in
a
cubit
however
at
the
land
was
still
visible
so
we
sallied
forth
into
the
marsh
again
and
secured
some
more
teal
and
then
esau
went
off
in
his
canoe
after
some
scaup
ducks
on
the
lake
and
brought
home
two
after
following
them
according
to
his
account
of
the
struggle
for
about
six
hours
while
they
swam
and
flew
and
dived
and
he
paddled
and
swore
and
shot
they
appear
to
have
roamed
over
the
whole
extent
of
this
vast
lake
seeking
safety
from
his
unerring
barrels
and
he
now
points
to
a
little
hill
far
below
the
distant
horizon
beneath
which
he
affirms
that
he
brought
the
last
victim
to
bay
and
slew
him

was

on

an
hour
and
a
quarter

canoe
will
go
about
five
miles

hour
and
the

is
seven
miles
long
but
we
did
not
come
out
here
to
do
arithmetic
illustration
scaup
we
settled
not
to
go
to
gjendin
ourselves
as
the
weather
was
so
very
unfavourable
but
we
packed
and
despatched
some
of
our
luggage
this
evening
and
purpose
following
it
before
doing
this
we
had
a
long
interview
with
jens
tronhūus
with
the
main
object
of
settling
all
accounts
now
a
long
interview
between
three
men
who
can
not
speak
two
words
of

is
a
somewhat
intricate
business
and
would
be
decidedly
amusing
to
beholders
how
we
got
through
it
is
beyond
the
wit
of
man
but
nevertheless
the
fact
remains
that
everything
is
beautifully
arranged
we
thoroughly
understand
each
other
both
sides
are
satisfied

we
concluded
everything

chapter
xi
gjendin
the
morning
appeared
rather
fine
so
we
packed
the
rest
of
our
baggage
and
climbed
the
track
which
leads
over
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
between
sjödals
vand
and
gjendin
pronounced
yendin
it
is
rather
steep
but
nothing
approaching
the
villany
of
the
tracks
near
sikkildals
sæter
so
the
transit
did
not
take
long
and
we
got
to
gjendesheim
about
twelve
o
clock
gjendesheim
is
a
very
good
wooden
building
with
a
large
and
about
eight
tiny
cupboards
of
bedrooms
it
has
been
erected
just
where
the
sjoa
river
runs
out
at
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
lake
for
the
benefit
of
travellers
who
can
get
food
and
lodging
of
a
sort
there
and
generally
boats
to
take
them
up
the
lake
ragnild
the
woman
who
presides
over
it
is
very
nice
kind
and
attentive
and
talks
english
well
her
latter
qualification
hardly
gets
fair
play
as
not
many
english
people
come
here
and
indeed
the
norwegians
who
visit
the
lake
are
not
very
numerous
from
the
book
we
can
only
see
two
english
names
before
us
this
year
and
yet
gjendin
is
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
certainly
the
wildest
and
grandest
lake
in
norway
and
is
well
worth
a
visit
from
any
tourist
who
has
time
at
his
disposal
illustration
our
first
view
of
gjendin
lake
it
is
eleven
miles
long
very
deep
very
blue
and
on
all
sides
rising
sheer
out
of
the
water
for
from
to
feet
are
vast
black
mountains
with
summits
for
it
lies
in
the
very
heart
of
the
highest
mountains
in
norway
it
may
not
unfairly
be
likened
to
an
unfrequented
and
awfully
desolate
lake
of
lucerne
at
feet
altitude
it
is
of
course
above
the
fir
trees
and
only
in
a
few
sunny
nooks
along
its
sides
can
even
stunted
birches
juniper
and
willow
earn
a
precarious
living
it
is
at
these
places
alone
that
there
is
any
exit
from
the
lake
for
along
the
greater
part
of
its
length
there
is
no
level
place
large
enough
to
pitch
a
tent
no
vegetation
except
berries
and
moss
and
no
possibility
of
scaling
the
frowning
cliffs
by
which
it
is
surrounded
but
there
is
a
great
fascination
in
such
a
scene
and
although
its
first
appearance
is
almost
repellent
every
moment
of
gazing
seems
to
increase
its
beauty
and
grandeur
at
lunch
here
a
great
event
happened
we
had
salon
öl
bottled
beer
and
immediately
bought
the
whole
remaining
stock
consisting
of
six
bottles
these
we
degraded
by
packing
with
the
inferior
baggage
in
the
canoes
and
commenced
the
final
stage
of
our
journey
or
voyage
whichever
is
the
right
term
about
two
miles
from
gjendesheim
on
the
south
shore
we
came
to
a
waterfall
which
runs
out
of
a
small
lake
lying
a
short
distance
away
up
in
the
valley
at
the
mouth
of
this
fall
was
a
small
neat
hut
in
which
a
christiania
professor
had
just
taken
up
his
abode
for
a
few
days
stalking
we
stopped
a
few
minutes
to
talk
to
him
and
then
paddled
on
trying
a
few
casts
now
and
then
until
we
came
to
memurudalen
our
intended
camp
it
is
about
halfway
up
the
lake
on
the
north
shore
and
is
a
very
pretty
little
valley
profusely
supplied
with
edible
berries
surrounded
by
thick
birch
covert
and
with
more
grass
than
we
ever
expected
to
find
at
this
altitude
but
it
is
by
far
the
most
favourably
situated
bit
of
the
gjendin
shores
as
it
is
sheltered
from
the
cold
winds
and
gets
the
sun
all
day
we
found
a
remarkably
nice
level
bit
of
grass
screened
by
a
rocky
bank
and
with
what
the
skipper
called
a
brattling
brooklet
in
front
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
lake
there
we
pitched
the
tent
and
made
everything
comfortable
but
of
course
we
shall
not
decide
whether
to
stay
here
or
not
until
we
have
tested
its
capabilities
as
reindeer
ground
beyond
the
purling
streamlet
and
about
thirty
yards
from
our
front
door
the
memurua
river
goes
tearing
down
the
colour
of
dirty
from
the
mud
which
is
ground
into
it
by
the
mighty
memuru
glacier
whence
it
springs
this
glacier
is
about
three
miles
from
us
up
the
valley
but
not
in
sight
from
our
tent
in
fact
the
hills
are
so
steep
that
we
are
quite
shut
in
and
can
see
very
little
except
the
and
peaks
just
opposite
to
us
across
the
lake
these
peaks
spring
from
the
highest
plateau
in
norway
which
has
an
altitude
of
about
feet
and
both
the
plateau
and
peaks
are
almost
inaccessible
to
the
hunter
as
it
is
a
day
s
work
to
climb
them
and
any
one
doing
so
would
probably
have
to
pass
the
night
on
the
top
this
is
annoying
for
it
is
a
capital
place
for
deer
an
ancient
hunter
some
years
ago
spent
a
long
time
in
conveying
with
incredible
exertions
to
the
top
of
the
central
peak
materials
out
of
which
he
constructed
a
windmill
then
he
descended
and
never
went
near
the
place
again
and
his
windmill
scared
all
the
deer
away
from
that
so
that
they
frequented
places
where
a
man
could
get
to
them
and
the
cunning
hunter
was
rewarded
by
many
stor
bocks
big
bucks
but
now
the
windmill
has
been
destroyed
by
time
and
weather
and
we
fear
that
the
deer
again
roam
there
unmolested
and
unscared
august
it
is
our
custom
to
rise
on
this
day
singing
come
rouse
ye
then
my
merry
merry
men
for
it
is
our
opening
day
but
on
this
occasion
it
would
not
have
been
appropriate
we
were
not
at
all
merry
because
it
was
sunday
and
raining
we
were
frozen
in
the
night
our
men
and
potatoes
have
not
come
and
altogether
we
could
see
nothing
to
be
merry
about
especially
as
the
opening
day
having
fallen
on
a
sunday
we
did
not
feel
justified
in
going
out
to
pursue
so
we
devoted
ourselves
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
last
night
we
had
dotterel
and
sandpipers
for
dinner
this
morning
greenshanks
which
are
very
good
birds
indeed
there
was
also
a
large
brew
of
a
meritorious
composition
known
as
skoggaggany
soup
the
name
is
a
little
difficult
to
pronounce
but
the
soup
does
not
taste
anything
like
it
it
is
merely
the
norwegian
for
a
scaup
duck
in
england
people
have
been
known
to
call
scaups
unfit
for
food
but
here
under
the
perfectly
awful
appetites
that
we
have
developed
the
skoggaggany
soup
has
very
little
chance
after
trying
unsuccessfully
to
catch
fish
we
walked
up
the
valley
after
lunch
to
look
for
a
hut
which
is
marked
on
the
ordnance
map
and
to
see
if
there
were
any
better
than
the
place
we
chose
yesterday
we
saw
some
beautiful
reindeer
ground
but
could
not
find
the
hut
or
a
camp
illustration
two
of
our
retainers
ivar
and
his
pony
on
our
return
we
perceived
two
men
loafing
about
the
tent
who
we
naturally
concluded
were
thieves
and
murderers
and
the
skipper
hurried
on
to
do
battle
with
them
to
the
death
for
the
possession
of
our
greatest
treasure
the
salon
öl
but
on
his
arrival
the
robbers
did
not
fly
but
stood
and
stared
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
so
he
lifted
his
hat
and
said
öla
for
of
course
he
might
have
been
a
dook
in
disguise
and
one
of
them
replied
ja
and
cordiality
being
thus
established
produced
the
sack
of
potatoes
and
the
cook
like
a
conjuring
trick
from
somewhere
behind
him
out
of
his
hat
or
coat
tails
then
we
went
into
all
kinds
of
details
with
him
about
his
and
ivar
s
wages
which
he
did
not
understand
and
he
replied
at
great
length
in
norsk
which
we
did
not
understand
and
so
the
interview
concluded
to
the
gratification
of
all
concerned
öla
is
a
big
man
rather
too
much
of
a
gentleman
we
fear
but
ivar
is
without
doubt
a
perfect
ass
and
will
never
be
able
to
do
anything
in
the
way
of
cookery
except
perhaps
boil
a
potato
and
even
in
that
enterprise
we
consider
it
would
be
six
to
four
on
the
potato
chapter
xii
the
camp
the
skipper
won
the
toss
he
always
does
chiefly
because
the
device
on
norwegian
coins
is
sorter
indifferent
like
and
when
esau
has
called
heads
or
tails
he
looks
at
it
carefully
and
gravely
declares
it
to
be
the
opposite
and
was
away
eight
hours
wandering
about
the
mountains
without
seeing
a
living
creature
except
two
buzzards
and
hardly
any
he
returned
to
camp
very
tired
and
rather
cross
to
find
a
delicious
meal
nearly
ready
cooked
by
esau
for
the
man
whom
we
ironically
call
the
cook
has
gone
to
fetch
his
horse
for
which
we
are
to
pay
a
day
as
long
as
we
have
it
the
cook
s
wages
are
to
be
a
day
and
those
of
the
stalker
we
consider
the
latter
cheap
at
that
rate
he
is
a
very
tall
man
very
big
very
heavy
and
very
bearded
and
we
hire
the
whole
of
him
for
the
trifling
sum
above
stated
besides
cooking
the
dinner
esau
had
been
employed
in
rigging
up
the
as
a
continuation
of
the
sleeping
tent
by
planting
an
upright
pole
securely
in
the
ground
in
front
of
the
door
and
connecting
its
top
with
the
old
tent
by
a
birch
tree
ridge
pole
it
thus
makes
a
very
convenient
place
for
all
our
large
stores
and
gives
us
much
more
room
in
the
tent
we
had
expected
the
men
to
sleep
in
it
but
they
prefer
living
in
a
wretched
little
stone
which
looks
as
if
fleas
would
swarm
in
it
and
has
been
built
by
drovers
or
some
other
dirty
people
for
their
lodging
when
they
chance
to
come
here
it
is
about
yards
from
our
tent
and
as
the
men
prefer
it
it
is
very
convenient
for
us
the
ground
that
the
skipper
tried
seemed
a
reindeer
fjeld
this
means
an
uneven
tract
of
mountain
country
too
high
for
vegetation
except
occasional
reindeer
flowers
and
patches
of
gentian
but
not
high
enough
to
be
entirely
covered
with
perpetual
snow
this
fjeld
where
it
is
not
snow
is
made
of
rocks
large
and
small
from
the
size
of
a
haystack
to
that
of
road
metal
some
of
them
firm
but
mostly
loose
jagged
and
sharp
the
winter
snow
and
frost
leave
them
in
this
condition
by
continually
splitting
and
them
they
are
dark
grey
in
colour
and
at
a
distance
look
almost
black
what
the
reindeer
can
find
attractive
in
such
a
place
possibly
some
one
can
tell
we
can
not
there
is
apparently
nothing
for
any
beasts
of
the
field
to
eat
up
there
but
if
you
do
happen
to
find
deer
before
they
see
you
they
are
certain
to
be
feeding
and
esau
thinks
they
are
eating
the
rocks
but
the
skipper
says
it
can
not
be
so
and
inclines
more
to
the
theory
that
they
feed
on
their
young
like
tame
rabbits
or
possibly
on
their
own
blood
like
the
pelican
of
the
wilderness
as
for
the
reindeer
flower
which
is
supposed
to
be
their
staff
of
life
it
averages
about
half
a
stalk
to
the
square
acre
but
possibly
it
is
possessed
of
many
highly
nutritious
qualities
and
a
little
of
it
goes
a
long
way
anyhow
they
thrive
on
their
food
whatever
it
may
be
they
are
always
very
fat
and
uncommonly
good
to
eat
when
you
chance
to
slay
one
after
dinner
we
tried
all
this
portion
of
the
lake
for
fish
without
success
and
coming
back
received
the
awful
intelligence
from
öla
that
there
are
no
fish
in
any
parts
of
gjendin
except
the
extreme
ends
and
the
waterfall
where
professor
n
is
living
this
is
a
dreadful
blow
to
us
for
we
always
count
upon
fishing
as
our
main
employment
and
fish
as
our
staple
food
and
if
we
can
not
get
any
here
we
shall
have
to
leave
at
present
we
have
some
which
we
brought
with
us
from
sjödals
but
when
they
are
exhausted
there
will
be
a
mutiny
in
this
camp
unless
sport
of
some
kind
presents
itself
a
curious
accident
happened
there
was
no
rain
we
have
in
vain
tried
to
account
for
this
phenomenon
and
can
only
fall
back
on
the
somewhat
unsatisfactory
theory
that
it
is
all
used
up
esau
went
after
deer
on
the
rus
vand
side
and
came
back
very
tired
to
dinner
without
having
seen
any
but
reported
fresh
tracks
he
was
full
of
the
glorious
view
that
the
fine
day
had
given
him
he
had
been
close
above
the
memuru
glacier
which
is
a
very
large
one
and
stretching
beyond
it
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
is
a
sea
of
snow
mountains
most
of
them
but
some
domes
or
irregular
precipices
with
immense
glaciers
lying
between
them
and
here
and
there
the
waters
of
a
lake
distantly
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
it
is
curious
to
note
how
the
north
and
east
sides
of
every
peak
are
torn
and
ragged
with
huge
masses
of
rock
riven
from
them
by
the
action
of
the
weather
while
on
the
south
and
west
they
are
comparatively
regular
the
skipper
spent
the
day
in
camp
completing
the
erection
of
the
outside
tent
our
abode
is
now
sumptuous
in
the
extreme
as
the
new
wing
holds
all
the
lumber
which
formerly
blocked
up
our
bedroom
there
was
some
discussion
as
to
whether
we
should
call
it
the
criterion
annexe
until
we
remembered
that
there
are
always
policemen
about
that
celebrated
building
and
this
decided
us
not
to
do
so
the
skipper
went
on
to
bes

stalking
this
is
a
high
mountain
feet
above
sea
level
it
is
close
to
us
between
gjendin
and

is
one
of
the
species
the
norwegians
call
their

the

returns
to

disgusted
with
life
from
bes
hö
the
skipper
got
a
good
view
between
the
storms
of
gjendin
lying
encircled
by
its
enormous
steep
black
banks
of
mountains
the
whole
of
its
eleven
miles
of
length
being
visible
at
once
its
colour
is
a
creamy
greenish
blue
caused
by
the
which
comes
straight
into
the
lake
by
scores
of
torrents
which
collect
it
from
the
various
glaciers
the
skipper
who
is
always
bubbling
over
with
poetic
similes
said
it
looked
like
a
cupful
of
very
blue
milk
in
a
crease
of
brown
paper
but
beautiful
as
this
idea
is
who
can
take
any
pleasure
in
scenery
without
a
little
ever
so
little
sport
to
flavour
it
withal
certainly
not
the
skipper
so
he
came
back
from
his
long
tramp
disgusted
with
life
and
longing
to
find
that
esau
had
played
the
fool
in
his
absence
so
that
he
might
be
able
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
him
unfortunately
esau
was
provokingly
amiable
and
had
been
performing
acts
of
virtue
such
as
making
soup
improving
the
tent
and
swearing
at
the
cook
the
whole
day
so
that
the
seething
volcano
of
the
skipper
s
temper
had
to
content
itself
without
an
eruption
we
did
manage
to
get
up
an
approach
to
a
row
about
the
memuru
glacier
which
the
skipper
had
visited
he
described
its
beauty
and
the
extraordinary
blue
of
the
ice
where
the
large
crevasses
near
its
lower
end
gave
glimpses
of
its
real
formation
for
of
course
it
is
covered
thickly
with
snow
except
just
where
it
begins
to
break
up
then
he
went
on
to
say
how
curious
it
was
to
think
that
this
huge
mass
covering
square
miles
of
ground
is
always
moving
onwards
and
that
no
more
powerful
agent
exists
for
altering
the
arrangement
of
the
earth
s
crust
than
that
cold
placid
field
of
ice
esau
said
it
did
move
he
watched
it
for
half
an
hour
yesterday
and
it
never
stirred
and
he
even
pushed
it
with
his
stick
without
the
smallest
effect
it
is
impossible
to
argue
with
a
man
of
that
kind
tyndall
and
geikie
being
disposed
of
we
had
a
discussion
in
the
tent
over
the
map
with
the
result
that
we
determined
to
leave
the
camp
for
four
days
in
charge
of
ivar
and
we
and
öla
would
go
to
gjendesheim
and
live
there
and
drink
beer
and
catch
fish
until
the
when
we
calculated
that
john
ought
to
arrive
and
we
hope
by
that
time
some
reindeer
will
have
sought
safety
from
other
guns
by
flying
to
the
sheltering
embrace
of
our
fjeld
we
always
do
our
baking
just
before
bedtime
when
the
men
have
gone
to
their
hutch
and
in
a
permanent
camp
it
soon
gets
reduced
to
a
certainty
we
prefer
milk
to
water
for
mixing
with
the
flour
as
it
makes
the
bread
crisper
and
shorter
and
it
does
not
matter
how
sour
the
milk
is
this
is
most
providential
as
we
have
generally
plenty
of
sour
milk
we
send
twice
a
week
to
besse
sæter
distant
about
eight
miles
and
the
long
journey
does
not
agree
with
the
milk
so
that
it
is
generally
turned
before
it
arrives
here
another
important
article
of
food
is
soup
of
which
we
have
several
varieties
when
made
of
scaup
duck
it
is
as
already
mentioned
called
skoggaggany
soup
but
our
present
brew
is
gipsy
soup
which
is
made
from
potatoes
fishes
chopped
into
small
lumps
a
square
of
kopf
s
compressed
vegetables
a
most
invaluable
article
and
all
the
bones
from
the
birds
that
we
happen
to
be
using
we
never
empty
the
pot
but
keep
adding
water
and
bones
as
fast
as
we
consume
it
and
it
simmers
by
the
fire
all
day
but
when
times
are
very
bad
and
we
have
no
meat
and
are
living
on
fish
our
soup
is
then
called
prairie
soup
and
is
composed
of
every
scrap
that
we
can
collect
bacon
potatoes
milk
dandelion
and
sorrel
bread
and
biscuits
and
whenever
it
develops
any
unusual
flavour
we
look
suspiciously
round
to
see
if
that
or
is
missing
or
if
any
of
the
have
been
newly
whittled
it
is
always
very
good
and
we
call
it
prairie
because
of
the
dandelion
which
is
a
prairie
flower
there
is
yet
one
more
kind
known
as
argonaut
soup
the
recipe
of
which
was
introduced
from
america
by
the
skipper
but
our
resources
have
never
yet
been
so
low
that
we
could
not
make
something
better
than
this
for
argonaut
take
a
pail
of
water
and
wash
it
clean
then
boil
it
till
it
is
brown
on
both
sides
pour
in
one
bean
when
the
bean
begins
to
worry
prepare
it
to
simmer
if
the
soup
will
not
simmer
it
is
too
rich
and
you
must
pour
in
more
water
dry
the
water
with
a
towel
before
you
put
it
in
the
drier

sooner

chapter
xiii
gjendesheim
such
a
lovely
morning
at
last
that
we
were
quite
tempted
to
stay
but
nobly
stuck
to
our
resolve
heaped
everything
we
possessed
except
rods
guns
and
a
change
of
raiment
into
the
inner
tent
and
covered
them
with
a
then
packed
the
selected
weapons
into
the
canoes
and
sailed
from
these
inhospitable
shores
not
far
from
camp
we
saw
some
fish
rising
under
a
cliff
and
though
it
was
a
dead
calm
and
the
sun
as
bright
as
sun
could
be
we
stopped
to
try
for
them
esau
soon
tired
of
casting
and
mentioning
that
if
could
not
catch
those
fish
no
one
could
paddled
off
to
make
a
formal
call
on
the
professor
and
ask
if
he
had
got
any
deer
the
skipper
persevered
and
was
rewarded
with
two
fish
weighing
about
three
pounds
and
the
most
perfect
fish
for
shape
and
condition
that
we
have
ever
seen
this
was
an
important
event
for
us
for
it
entirely
demolished
öla
s
theory
of
the
of
fish
here
and
gave
us
new
hope
for
the
future
especially
as
the
weather
has
been
so
bad
all
the
time
until
now
that
we
should
hardly
have
caught
any
even
if
they
swarmed
illustration
throwing
for
a
rise
the
skipper
is
devoted
to
the
sport
of
throwing
for
a
rise
which
he
thinks
the
perfection
of
fishing
it
can
hardly
be
pursued
with
success
anywhere
but
in
norway
for
only
there
do
fish
seem
to
rise
greedily
after
a
constant
succession
of
fine
hot
sunny
days
with
never
a
drop
of
rain
or
cat
of
wind
the
great
charm
to
him
is
the
extreme
delicacy
required
you
put
on
your
thinnest
cast
your
smallest
fly
and
throw
your
lightest
and
unless
you
throw
a
very
long
line
you
have
not
a
chance
for
the
beggar
then
if
he
comes
at
you
you
can
see
him
through
the
calm
clear
water
and
watch
the
whole
performance
you
get
a
rather
better
chance
where
two
fish
are
rising
close
together
as
there
is
some
jealousy
and
competition
between
them
and
each
of
them
is
likely
to
rush
at
your
fly
without
sufficient
meditation
lest
the
other
one
may
get
it
first
the
skipper
has
studied
fish
from
a
moral
point
of
view
and
says
that
they
are
very
much
like
men
and
he
invariably
turns
his
knowledge
of
their
habits
to
good
account
throwing
for
a
rise
in
a
lake
like
this
where
the
fish
run
large
on
a
calm
bright
day
is
decidedly
his
forte
his
motto
in
fishing
being
far
and
whereas
esau
shines
more
in
a
rapid
stream
than
elsewhere
the
latter
had
a
great
time
with
the
professor
who
he
said
was
a
capital
fellow
and
gave
him
whisky
which
they
drank
to
better
sport
and
they
both
agreed
that
there
were
no
reindeer
to
be
found
in
the
district
at
present
and
the
professor
said
he
was
going
further
north
if
matters
did
not
mend
speedily
after
the
fishing
and
visiting
were
concluded
we
hoisted
sails
of
primitive
construction
formed
of
a
rug
and
a
landing
net
which
with
a
fair
wind
soon
brought
us
to
gjendesheim
we
think
this
wind
is
the
chief
cause
of
our
misfortune
when
we
were
in
these
parts
before
the
wind
was
always
against
us
whenever
we
journeyed
and
in
that
year
we
had
sport
both
in
shooting
and
fishing
but
this
time
the
wind
has
always
been
with
us
and
we
pay
for
the
luxury
by
getting
no
shooting
and
not
much
fishing

the
skipper
with
öla
went
over
to
leirungen
a
small
lake
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
distant
öla
carried
his
canoe
and
did
not
like
the
job
it
gives
us
considerable
satisfaction
to
make
öla
do
any
work
he
is
so
abominably
lazy
it
seemed
that
the
tide
of
luck
was
already
changing
as
both
he
and
esau
who
was
throwing
a
fly
on
the
river
nearer
home
brought
in
a
few
nice
fish
just
before
bedtime
there
arrived
at
the
three
norwegian
tourists
of
the
sterner
sex
and
a
young
lady
the
daughter
of
one
of
them
the
father
was
a
barrister
and
the
other
two
were
the
lord
chief
justice
of
what
they
imagine
to
be
common
pleas
and
a
very
thin
student
of
theology
they
all
talked
english
and
the
young
lady
seemed
anxious
to
practise
the
language
after
a
gay
breakfast
esau
went
his
way
to
fish
while
the
skipper
ever
devoted
to
the
fair
sex
offered
miss
louise
a
cruise
in
his
canoe
the
sun
shone
brightly
as
they
moved
over
the
quiet
waters
and
the
fish
were
too
lazy
to
rise
but
lay
idly
thoughtful
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
the
skipper
was
very
polite
to
his
charming
companion
as
she
sat
in
a
state
of
blissful
comfort
amongst
the
rugs
which
he
had
placed
for
her
in
the
bows
of
the
boat
and
no
sound
was
heard
but
the
gentle
plash
of
the
paddle
in
the
water
and
in
the
distance
the
sæter
girl
calling
home

grazing
cows

presently
a
cloud
gathered
over
the
mountain
tops
and
thunder
was
heard
rolling
among
the
distant
hills
a
gentle
breeze
stirred
the
surface
of
the
water
and
every
lazy
fish
woke
up
to
seek
his
food
the
skipper
longed
to
go
and
fetch
his
rod
he
hinted
at
this
and
at
last
became
impatient
but
by

miss

would
not
go
there
she
sat
and
prattled
on

pleased
with
herself
and
utterly
unmindful
of
the
rising
fish
and
the
fretting
skipper

kept
passing
on
till
at
length
her
father
brought
relief
by
appearing
on
the
shore
to
call
her
in
to
dinner
but
then
the
skipper
had
to
get
his
food
too
and
when
he
had
bolted
the
humble
but
indigestible
crust
and
cheese
and
rushed
out
again
to
seize
his
rod
he
found
it
too
late
as
the
lake
was
now
dark
with
clouds
and
the
fish
had
left
off
rising
soon
after
lunch
it
began
to
rain
like
a
waterfall
and
esau
arrived
with
a
lot
of
fish
spoils
from
the
leirungen
ocean

the
result
of
spartan
indifference
to
the
attractions
of
woman
there
is
a
shining

also
brought
a

had
been
so
close
to
him

the
two
ends
met
at
his
feet
the
rain
hereabouts
is
very
thick
the
evening
proved
too
wet
to
fish
and
this
indefatigable
young
lady
captured
esau
and
after
exhausting
all
the
ordinary
topics
of
conversation
began
to
show
him
every
kind
of
puzzle
that
the
mind
of
man
ever
conceived
puzzles
with
coins
and
puzzles
with
string
and
she
puzzled
him
with
matches
and
paper
and
corks
till
the
poor
young
man
became
perfectly
dazzled
and
only
longed
for
bedtime
to
put
an
end
to
his
misery
then
she
asked
him
riddles
first
english
and
then
french
the
skipper
apparently
deeply
interested
in
a
book
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
overheard
esau
s
answer
to
the
first
french
riddle
it
was
je
le
donne
en
presently
when
they
went
up
to
bed
the
skipper
said
i
didn
t
quite
follow
your
answer
to
that
first
riddle
of
hers
you
said
je
le
donne
en
oh
ah
answered
esau
that
s
idiomatic
french
and
means
a
good
deal
that
you
don
t
understand
i
always
use
it
to
gals
especially
when
they
re
the
skipper
coughed
and
turned
into
his
bedroom
without
saying
good
we
have
always
been
told
that
the
norwegian
aristocracy
particularly
dislike
the
english
sportsman
in
norway
we
think
therefore
that
our
fair
friend
can
not
have
been
of
very
noble
lineage
but
she
was
very
nice
and
rather
pretty
she
left
early
next
morning
and
esau
said
he
was
glad
she
was
gone
as
the
skipper
was
getting
entangled
with
her
chapter
xiv
john
we
began
another
day
by
catching
a
beautiful
bag
of
fish
and
about
midday
were
just
starting
to
shoot
our
way
over
to
besse
sæter
when
a
man
came
in
sight
stumbling
down
the
mountain
track
towards
the
he
was
red
and
sunburnt
with
a
beard
of
about
three
days
growth
he
was
coatless
collarless
and
apparently
exhausted
on
his
nearer
approach
we
saw
he
was
an
englishman
and
presently
when
a
few
yards
from
us
we
recognised
john
not
the
smart
young
beau
we
have
always
seen
him
in
london
no
longer
the
devotee
to
society
and
his
club
but
an
almost
unrecognizable
john
so
sunburnt
and
hot
and
hungry
formal
greetings
were
exchanged
dr
livingstone
i
presume
mr
stanley
i
believe
and
we
rushed
into
each
other
s
embrace
then
we
besought
him
to
refresh
himself
on
fladbrod
milk
and
coffee
which
he
did
largely
after
this
he
became
calm
enough
to
give
us
a
brief
summary
of
his
adventures
since
he
left
england
he
had
done
the
journey
from
christiania
in
very
quick
time
and
had
left
all
his
luggage
twenty
miles
behind
at
hind
sæter
which
is
the
nearest
place
to
us
to
which
wheeled
vehicles
can
get
from
thence
he
had
started
at
five
o
clock
this
morning
how
he
found
the
way
is
a
marvel
but
by
great
good
fortune
he
met
a
man
when
he
was
about
three
miles
out
of
the
track
who
put
him
right
otherwise
he
would
probably
never
have
arrived
anywhere
he
has
brought
additional
stores
for
the
camp
as
arranged
before
we
left
england
and
we
had
left
a
note
in
christiania
asking
him
to
call
at
the
shop
in
vaage
and
try
to
get
a
small
stove
for
the
tent
or
at
any
rate
find
out
the
price
of
one
vaage
is
our
nearest
village
about
fifty
miles
distant
when
john
arrived
there
seeing
the
shop
as
he
drove
past
he
descended
from
his
cariole
and
entered
the
shop
was
full
of
people
buying
all
the
necessaries
of
life
for
in
these
villages
there
is
only
one
shop
which
is
a
general
store
for
everything
john
was
a
little
confused
at
his
first
experience
of
a
norwegian
shop
but
at
last
pulled
himself
together
and
seeing
a
stove
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
intended
for
heating
the
place
he
walked
up
to
it
and
stroking
it
gently
with
his
hand
looked
round
at
the
people
generally
and
remarked
hvor
meget
how
much
dead
silence
not
unmingled
with
awe
followed
this
observation
for
those
simple
rustics
thought
there
was
a
maniac
among
them
this
perplexed
john
and
as
everybody
was
staring
at
him
and
he
began
to
find
himself
in
a
remarkably
tight
place
he
concluded
to
make
another
remark
so
asked
in
norsk
have
you
any
whisky
the
storekeeper
having
no
licence
looked
horrified
and
said
so
john
pursued
his
advantage
by
inquiring
have
you
any
aquavit
nei
was
again
the
answer
and
an
ominous
whisper
of
landsmand
the
policeman
was
plainly
audible
john
thought
he
had
asked
enough
about
stoves
to
quiet
his
conscience
and
guessed
it
was
time
to
quit
that
shop
so
rapidly
regaining
his
cariole
he
vanished
before
any
of
the
crowd
had
made
up
their
minds
what
to
do
we
kept
to
our
plan
of
going
to
besse
sæter
starting
as
soon
as
john
had
finished
his
lunch
and
got
several
teal
and
a
greenshank
on
the
way
on
one
little
bit
of
water
we
spied
three
teal
near
the
bank
and
having
both
together
made
a
most
skilful
stalk
got
them
all
arriving
at
besse
sæter
we
found
one
of
the
two
rooms
occupied
by
two
swedish
ladies
who
were
travelling
about
by
themselves
for
the
sake
of
their
health
one
of
them
spoke
english
well
and
told
us
they
had
been
up
several
of
the
high
mountains
round
and
intended
to
wander
about
all
the
summer
we
three
had
to
be
content
with
the
other
room
and
two
beds
odd
man
out
for
the
whole
one
those
who
only
had
half
a
bed
reported
it
rather
a
crowd
in
the
morning
august
our
object
in
coming
to
besse
sæter
was
to
break
the
journey
to
a
place
called
rus
vand
where
a
norwegian
owns
a
lake
and
hut
it
is
distant
about
two
hours
walk
from
besse
sæter
and
we
had
a
letter
of
introduction
to
thomas
the
owner
which
we
were
anxious
to
deliver
so
as
to
obtain
leave
to
fish
in
the
lake
the
western
end
of
which
comes
to
within
walking
distance
of
our
camp
in
memurudalen
and
the
fishing
is
remarkably
good
therefore
this
morning
we
started
to
clamber
up
the
steep
mountain
side
that
has
to
be
crossed
between
besse
sæter
and
rus
vand
and
skirting
the
shores
of
bes
vand
which
lies
on
a
small
plateau
at
the
summit
we
soon
found
ourselves
scrambling
down
over
the
loose
stones
and
through
the
willow
scrub
that
covers
the
uneven
slopes
approaching
the
east
end
of
the
lake
from
our
side
of
the
river
when
we
reached
its
banks
while
a
boat
was
crossing
to
fetch
us
we
saw
several
men
and
a
couple
of
setters
a
pointer
and
a
target
fixed
up
about
yards
from
the
huts
so
that
the
place
presented
a
very
sporting
appearance
thomas
received
us
very
kindly
and
at
once
gave
us
permission
to
fish
in
his
lake
both
he
and
his
wife
spoke
english
perfectly
as
did
another
lady
staying
with
them
and
as
most
emphatically
did
another
sportsman
also
living
there
these
two
ladies
and
two
gentlemen
were
all
living
in
a
little
hut
each
room
being
about
nine
feet
square
and
the
doorway
about
five
feet
high
and
two
wide
the
gentlemen
s
bedroom
being
also
the
kitchen
how
the
ladies
managed
to
turn
themselves
out
in
such
faultless
apparel
was
a
mystery
but
it
was
done
for
we
saw
it
illustration
the
huts
at
rusvasoset
it
is
a
very
plucky
thing
for
ladies
to
come
up
here
and
live
for
a
month
even
now
when
there
is
a
of
a
sort
to
within
fifteen
miles
but
the
same
thing
was
done
by
english
ladies
ten
years
ago
when
there
was
no
road
nearer
than
forty
miles
are
their
names
not
written
in
the
chronicles
which
adorn
the
walls
of
the
hut
and
carved
on
the
profile
fishes
which
decorate
the
floor
in
the
other
hut
which
is
little
more
than
a
boat
there
are
living
jens
tronhūus
our
old
stalker
siva
the
man
who
carried
our
canoes
up
the
mountain
at
sikkildal
and
another
native
also
the
dogs
besides
bottles
and
churns
grindstones
saws
axes
and
all
the
other
heterogeneous
articles
which
accumulate
in
a
place
of
this
kind
it
looked
full
we
found
the
party
just
sitting
down
to
breakfast
after
a
rather
unsettled
night
as
they
had
been
roused
about
two
in
the
morning
by
some
one
hammering
at
the
door
and
found
it
was
a
young
norwegian
named
let
us
say
coutts
who
was
making
a
walking
tour
and
was
more
or
less
lost
they
succoured
him
with
coffee
and
other
refreshments
and
sent
him
on
his
way
with
jens
to
guide
him
coutts
s
intention
was
to
struggle
on
to
besse
sæter
but
we
had
seen
nothing
of
him
there
we
stayed
some
time
at
the
huts
talking
and
looking
at
all
the
memorable
objects
that
were
there
under
our
as
we
had
occupied
these
huts
and
had
the
fishing
to
ourselves
two
years
previously
there
was
esau
s
celebrated
biggest
trout
whatever
was
seen
carved
on
the
floor
the
skipper
s
favourite
cast
and
the
ice
safe
that
we
cunningly
devised
and
constructed
in
the
lower
hut
the
thomas
s
are
in
even
worse
case
than
we
for
like
us
they
have
seen
no
deer
and
they
have
so
many
more
mouths
to
feed
however
they
have
any
quantity
of
fish
for
rusvasoset
is
as
good
a
place
as
the
sjoa
at
gjendesheim
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
about
one
we
commenced
the
homeward
journey
two
of
jens
sisters
had
come
with
us
nominally
to
see
their
brother
but
really
john
asserted
for
the
purpose
of
flirting
with
he
was
extremely
polite
to
one
of
them
though
of
course
he
could
not
speak
to
her
and
would
insist
on
carrying
her
shawl
and
other
impediments
and
he
confided
to
us
afterwards
that
women
were
generally
a
good
deal
taken
by
that
sort
of
mute
she
was
a
dear
little
girl
and
we
called
her
the
sæter
darlen
which
we
believe
to
be
the
only
norwegian
pun
we
ever
attempted
footnote
john
said
this
pun
might
be
elucidated
with
advantage
to
the
british
public
as
he
did
not
believe
any
one
could
possibly
see
it
who
cares
down
it
goes
and
we
can
assure
any
one
who
likes
to
wrestle
with
it
that
it
is
something
very
good
indeed
the
walk
home
to
gjendesheim
is
a
long
one
and
although
it
was
sunday
esau
insisted
on
making
a
détour
over
the
marsh
with
his
gun
as
he
said
he
had
lost
his
knife
there
yesterday
and
wanted
to
look
for
it
he
arrived
late
at
gjendesheim
with
a
satisfied
air
on
his
face
without
his
trusty
steel
but
with
his
pockets
thrust
full
of
too
trustful
teal
that
had
adventured
themselves
within
his
reach
at
gjendesheim
we
found
the
young
norwegian
who
had
roused
up
the
thomas
s
at
rus
vand
and
perceived
that
he
was
not
without
some
peculiarities
of
character
although
the
weather
was
as
wet
and
cold
as
weather
could
be
he
was
attired
in
a
suit
of
white
duck
clothes
like
an
english
mechanic
even
his
hat
was
of
white
duck
and
esau
declared
afterwards
that
his
boots
were
made
of
the
same
material
that
he
had
a
and
cigars
of
it
and
ordered
white
ducks
for
his
dinner
the
appearance
of
his
head
caused
us
to
be
very
anxious
about
any
little
articles
of
value
that
we
had
about
us
for
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
shaved
all
over
about
two
days
previously
to
our
making
his
acquaintance
he
looked
very
strong
tough
and
active
and
no
doubt
was
so
for
he
had
just
performed
a
most
extraordinary
walking
feat
he
is
going
over
all
the
jotun
mountains
by
himself
and
yesterday
morning
he
started
from
a
place
an
unknown
number
of
miles
away
at
he
walked
all
day
and
all
night
till
it
got
dark
at
which
time
he
was
somewhere
near
glitretind
in
a
country
he
had
never
seen
with
only
a
vague
notion
of
where
he
wanted
to
get
to
and
a
pocket
compass
to
do
it
with
the
country
about
there
is
perfectly
awful
to
walk
over
even
by
day
but
he
kept
at
it
through
the
dark
following
a
torrent
up
till
he
crossed
the
watershed
and
following
another
torrent
down
till
he
got
to
rus
vand
and
staggered
into
the
hut
there
at
almost
fainting
for
he
had
had
nothing
to
eat
all
day
true
he
might
have
got
fladbrod
at
the
sæters
during
the
day
but
he
said
he
did
not
care
for
fladbrod
certainly
he
had
plenty
of
chocolate
in
his
knapsack
but
he
was
tired
of
chocolate
at
rus
vand
he
got
some
coffee
as
thomas
told
us
and
then
he
walked
over
the
mountain
with
jens
to
besse
sæter
intending
to
sleep
there
but
we
were
snoring
at
our
ease
in
all
the
beds
of
besse
sæter
and
he
hated
sleeping
on
floors
so
he
walked
on
again
to
gjendesheim
arriving
there
at
five
this
morning
then
he
produced
his
knapsack
which
he
said
weighed
lbs
it
seemed
to
be
chiefly
filled
with
packets
of
most
delicious
chocolate
some
of
which
he
gave
us
we
thought
him
a
fellow
but
certainly
a
little
peculiar
he
has
been
all
over
the
world
and
is
great
at
natural
history
having
stuffed
many
birds
in
foreign
countries
for
the
museum
at
christiania
the
skipper
had
the
next
room
to
his
and
told
us
that
at
bedtime
he
washed
himself
all
over
cleaned
his
teeth
and
brushed
his
hair
he
then
stayed
in
bed
till
eleven
o
clock
next
morning
when
he
rose
and
went
through
the
whole
performance
again
now
we
did
not
mind
him
washing
or
brushing
his
teeth
we
even
respect
him
for
doing
it
but
brushing
his
hair
was
a
simple
insult
to
common
sense
and
a
wicked
waste
of
time
for
not
a
bristle
on
his
head
whether
hair
moustache
or
beard
was
more
than
an
eighth
of
an
inch
long
and
all
of
it
was
much
stiffer
than
any
yet
made
it
was
suggested
that
perhaps
he
was
only
combing
his
with
his
head
and
with
this
explanation
we
had
to
rest
content
we
luxuriated
on
meat
for
they
have
actually
caught
and
killed
a
sheep
we
fish
with
considerable
success
now
at
every
odd
moment
of
the
day
as
the
canoes
are
moored
to
the
shore
not
six
yards
from
the
house
and
it
takes
no
time
to
get
into
them
and
push
out
into
the
deep
lake
or
hover
about
the
brink
of
the
long
rapids
where
the
lake
begins
to
be
a
river
chapter
xv
back
to
camp
the
morning
was
again
very
wet
but
we
are
men
of
great
decision
and
firmness
what
our
friends
call
obstinate
if
they
are
civil
and
when
they
want
to
be
disagreeable
as
friends
usually
do
therefore
we
started
for
the
camp
after
lunch
that
is
to
say
the
skipper
and
esau
started
as
john
remained
to
await
the
arrival
of
his
baggage
for
which
ivar
had
been
despatched
at
present
his
wardrobe
is
not
very
extensive
and
he
will
perhaps
be
more
comfortably
fixed
after
the
arrival
of
his
valise
he
has
one
coat
one
flannel
shirt
without
collar
one
pair
of
trousers
socks
and
boots
one
pipe
one
cap
one
fishing
rod
line
and
one
and
a
newspaper
of
july
about
two
miles
from
gjendesheim
on
the
north
side
of
the
lake
there
is
an
apparently
perpendicular
cliff
half
a
mile
long
and
over
feet
high
this
is
called
the
beseggen
and
at
the
top
of
it
lies
bes
vand
so
close
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
that
it
seems
impossible
to
believe
that
the
lake
is
feet
above
gjendin
with
nothing
but
a
narrow
strip
of
rock
to
hold
it
within
its
bounds
and
yet
the
books
say
it
is
so
and
we
always
believe
anything
we
find
in
a
book
the
cliff
looks
perfectly
unscaleable
but
we
believe
it
has
been
descended
twice
by
an
englishman
who
used
to
live
here
and
once

is
so
high
that

not

the
professional
liars
of
these
parts
say
it
freezes
solid
every
winter
and
kills
any
that
have
been
put
into

it
is
a
little
difficult
to
believe
this
statement
as
it
is
a
large
and
deep
lake
but
john
says
that
a
man
who
will
believe
a
can
believe
anything
so
we
all
do
our
best
to
swallow
it
the
statement
not
the

we
have
hardly
enough
whisky
to
make
the
latter
palatable
gjendin
is
liable
like
all
mountain
lakes
to
be
suddenly
visited
by
squalls
so
that
we
generally
like
to
paddle
pretty
near
the
side
but
on
this
voyage
it
was
not
safe
to
do
so
for
under
the
influence
of
the
rain
which
was
coming
down
as
if
it
had
never
done
so
before
stones
and
boulders
were
rattling
and
crashing
down
the
sides
of
the
lake
and
plunging
into
it
in
a
most
alarming
manner
and
as
far
as
we
could
see
the
steep
black
rocks
were
thickly
streaked
with
white
lines
denoting
torrents
rushing
down
in
places
where
ordinarily
none
were
to
be
seen
just
as
we
were
passing
the
beseggen
a
dull
boom
like
that
of
a
distant
cannon
was
heard
and
looking
up
we
could
see
far
above
our
heads
a
huge
spout
of
muddy
water
shoot
out
from
the
cliff
carrying
with
it
masses
of
stone
and
of
all
sorts
evidently
some
bank
had
given
way
under
the
increased
pressure
of
this
enormous
rainfall
we
thought
for
one
brief
moment
that
it
might
be
bes
vand
let
loose
on
us
for
even
in
fine
weather
it
can
always
be
seen
leaking
through
fissures
in
the
rock
so
narrow
is
the
division
between
the
two
lakes
but
we
did
not
stop
to
ascertain
where
it
came
from
it
soon
became
necessary
to
land
and
empty
the
canoes
by
reason
of
the
heavy
rain
the
bottom
boards
being
completely
under
water
though
we
had
only
been
afloat
for
half
an
hour
just
before
we
got
to
memurudalen
the
sun
came
out
esau
had
a
chase
after
a
diver
that
came
up
from
a
dive
quite
close
to
his
canoe
and
then
we
both
fell
to
fishing
and
got
several
good
fish
this
is
just
our
luck
we
had
left
camp
for
the
last
few
days
on
purpose
to
get
fish
for
food
we
had
caught
many
and
salted
them
and
brought
back
lbs
weight
with
us
in
a
large
tin
can
and
then
behold
we
caught
fresh
fish
in
a
place
where
we
were
assured
by
öla
that
there
were
none
not
even
salted
ones
we
found
the
camp
looking
uncommonly
pretty
and
comfortable
and
all
our
things
perfectly
dry
and
nice
the
sun
shone
and
blue
sky
appeared
so
that
hope
contentment
and
joy
reigned
supreme
for
we
knew
that
it
could
not
rain
any
more
now
for
at
least
a
month
from
the
way
it
stopped
quite
with
a
jerk
as
the
supply
ceased
john
spent
his
day
at
gjendesheim
in
eating
drinking
and
fishing
especially
the
two
former
amusements
truly
that
is
a
glorious
country
where
a
man
can
himself
three
times
a
day
and
never
have
indigestion
esau
stalked
with
the
usual
result

as
the
norsk
jäger
would
remark
which
means
no
deer
no
fresh
tracks
no
old
tracks
and
he
returned
to
camp
to
find
the
skipper
had
erected
a
flagstaff
on
the
little
mound
beside
our
tent
and
from
this
staff
now
floats
proudly
the
flag
that
braved
a
thousand
years
which
we
brought
with
us
for
this
purpose
a
smaller
one
always
adorns
the
ridge
of
the
tent
we
do
not
know
exactly
the
use
of
this
flag
we
say
it
is
hoisted
to
annoy
the
norwegians
but
this
reason
will
not
bear
criticism
for
that
is
the
last
thing
we
should
think
of
doing
and
it
certainly
never
seems
to
have
that
effect
on
any
one
who
has
yet
seen
it
but
we
think
that
no
gentleman
s
residence
is
complete
without
a
red
ensign
therefore
on
high
days
and
holidays
that
rag
will
flaunt
itself
in
the
breeze
and
every
day
will
now
be
a
holiday
for
the
fine
weather
has
begun
at
last
the
skipper
had
made
all
sorts
of
improvements
in
our
domestic
arrangements
and
after
tea
we
completed
the
alterations
in
the
bedroom
which
were
necessary
before
john
arrived
this
he
did
in
a
boat
with
ivar
about
nine
o
clock
pretty
well
tired
with
his
row
against
a
head
wind
he
was
received
with
much
kindness
by
the
barbarous
islanders
but
it
took
us
until
late
at
night
to
get
everything
comfortably
and
conveniently
placed
under
canvas
for
john
made
no
slight
addition
to
our
already
ponderous
stores
in
the
shape
of
two
more
boxes
containing
tea
coffee

sugar
jam
and
at
last
esau

we
placed
the
three
beds
side
by
side
in
the
inner
tent
john
being
in
the
middle
for
the
sake
of
greater
warmth
for
the
nights
are
very
cold
among
the
things
that
we
obtained
through
jens
were
two
sheepskin
rugs
invaluable
for
protection
against
cold
till
we
got
them
we
were
more
or
less
wretched
every
night
but
since
they
came
our
sleep
has
been
perfectly
luxurious
john
has
only
two
ordinary
scotch
rugs
and
feels
the
cold
a
good
deal

we
from
our
impervious
sheepskins
give
him
any

last
night
at
sunset
we
could
not
see
a
cloud
because
no
cloud
was
in
the
sky
the
distant
mountains
looked
as
black
as

and
the

were
colour
whereupon
öla
committed
himself
to
the
statement
that
the
fine
weather
would
now
be
a
permanent
institution
consequently
our
life
has
once
more
resumed
its
proper
phase
of
perpetual
picnic
and
we
roam
about
without

or
waistcoats
or
any
other
garments
that
seem
superfluous
unto
us

to
john
all

to

unnecessary

we
were
shivering
with

wrapped
in

and

and

the

is
dancing
with

the

with
the

mirrored
in
its

we

has
been
a
source
of
great
annoyance
to
john
during
the
night
he
wants
to
have
it
turned

because
its
roaring
kept
him
awake
and
he
was
going
first
thing
after

to
see
the

of
course
it
is
hopeless
the
municipal
arrangements
here
are
much
the

as
in

and
that
official
can
not
be

when
wanted

have
to
content

to

as

the

are
rather
in

illustration
john
and
esau
how
s
that
for
high
we
all
went
fishing
and
made
a
very
pretty
catch
among
us
the
skipper
securing
the
greatest
weight
and
esau
the
largest
fish
weight
lbs
the
skipper
also
made
some
interesting
notes
on
the
moral
and
physical
characteristics
of
these
gjendin
trout
he
said
there
seemed
to
be
three
methods
of
feeding
in
vogue
among
them
some
were
moving
in
a
large
circle
about
two
hundred
yards
in
diameter
and
rising
at
very
short
intervals
as
they
went
these
never
came
within
ten
yards
of
the
shore
then
there
were
some
that
were
travelling
along
about
a
yard
from
the
shore
and
these
seemed
to
be
rising
even
more
frequently
than
the
others
as
there
were
more
flies
close
to
the
rocks
than
out
in
and
there
were
a
few
cunning
old
beggars
that
had
got
a
comfortable
hole
under
a
rock
which
they
did
not
like
to
leave
and
only
rose
at
longer
intervals
as
especially
tasty
morsels
floated
by
all
the
fish
to
whichever
class
of
risers
they
might
belong
often
took
the
moving
artificial
fly
in
preference
to
real
dead
ones
that
were
lying
on
the
surface
of
the
water
close
by
from
which
we
opine
that
they
resemble
us
to
the
extent
of
liking
fresh
food
better
than
stale
for
our
flies
had
no
attractive
tinsel
to
commend
them
to
the
notice
of
an
epicurean
trout
being
the
best
imitations
we
can
manage
of
the
predominant
fly
which
is
a
small
winged
ant
with
a
little
reddish
orange
about
the
long
black
body
these
flies
have
but
a
brief
and
disastrous
existence
they
only
flew
for
the
first
time
this
morning
most
of
them
had
died
by
noon
for
the
lake
was
strewn
with
their
corpses
and
the
survivors
were
all
worried
and
consumed
by
fish
before
nightfall
luckily
there
are
plenty
more
where
they
came
from
and
the
process
can
be
repeated
on
new
flies
tomorrow
it
is
very
interesting
to
catch
a
fish
off
these
rocks
on
a
perfectly
calm
day
like
this
for
in
the
clear
water
you
can
see
the
whole
of
the
struggle
from
the
moment
the
fish
rises
till
he
is
lying
panting
and
exhausted
in
the
net
how
beautiful
a
big
fish
looks
when
he
first
comes
ashore
how
brightly
he
shines
in
the
sunlight
and
how
sleek
is
his
portly
person
even
if
you
can
not
see
your
fish
rise
and
take
the
fly
you
can
soon
tell
by
his
behaviour
whereabouts
the
needle
will
come
if
you
succeed
in
getting
him
on
to
the
weighing
hook
a
large
fish
very
seldom
rises
with
any
dash
or
swagger
but
just
a
smothered
ripple
perhaps
a
glimpse
of
his
nose
as
he
sucks
in
the
fly
and
he
moves
as
if
he
were
a
nobody
then
when
he
feels
the
hook
there
is
none
of
that
dash
and
wriggle
that
you
find
in
a
small
fish
but
generally
a
rush
like
a
rocket
towards
the
middle
of
the
lake
making
you
tremble
for
the
safety
of
your
reel
line
and
after
that
a
stately
diving
and
calm
dignified
resistance
for
five
or
ten
minutes
till
he
has
to
give
in
sometimes
though
not
so
often
the
rocket
business
will
be
repeated
more
than
once
and
a
fish
that
does
this
deserves
to
escape
and
often
gets
his
deserts
there
is
something
very
fine
about
the
proud
bearing
of
a
big
trout
in
difficulties
for
here
in
the
lake
he
has
not
the
same
chance
as
his
relations
in
the
running
water

their

revived
and
presently
they
descried
on
a
snow
fjeld
about
a
mile
away
two
deer
scooting
over
the
opposite

these
they
followed
and
made

get
the

much

than

they
had
the

was
against

were
wrong
for

and
a
puff
came
just
at
the
moment
which
carried
the
unwelcome
intelligence
to
those
deer
that
their
hated
enemy
was
upon
them
and
they
departed
round
a
corner
at
a
rapid
trot
and
were
no
more
seen

looked
at
the
skipper
with

peter

told

were
walking
over

to
see

had

these

arrived
extremely
hot
and
looking
as
if

would
like
beer

we
appeased
them
with
one
of

remaining
bottles
and
after
showing
them
all
the
sights
of

took
them
out

of
them
spoke

little
english
the
other
only
french

the
latter
asked
the
skipper
in

gallic
tongue
if
we
had
entrapped
many
fish
and
if
we
had
not
fear
to
venture
on
the
lake
in
such
small
boats
and
informed
him
that
there
were
many
savage
ducks
about
this
the
other
one
regardless
of
his
own
life
and
safety
and
also
of
esau
s
in
whose
canoe
he
was
sitting
keep
throwing
up
his
arms
and
exclaiming
it
gives
us
moch
playsure
to
make
a
travel
in
the
canadian
but
we
think
they
were
proud
and
thankful
when
the
experiment
was
over
and
they
were
safe
in
peter
s
boat
these
strangers
displayed
unwonted
courage
for
the
ordinary
native
has
a
wholesome
dread
of
our
frail
craft
the
hardy
norseman
s
house
of
yore
was
doubtless
on
the
foaming
wave
but
that
was
before
the
days
of
canadian
canoes
at
dinner
john
informed
the
company
that
his
bath
in
the
lake
yesterday
was
the
third
of
a
series
the
first
of
which
took
place
in
montenegro
the
second
in
algiers
and
now
this
in
norway
he
calls
this
a
humble
tribute
to
the
geniality
of
the
english
summer
and
thinks
that
he
may
be
termed
a
polyglot
some
of
the
sojourners
in
this
camp
say
it
may
be
so
but
it
does
not
speak
highly
for
john
s
love
of
water
when
undiluted
with
whisky
subsequently
we
found
that
the
bath
which
he
swaggered
about
only
occurred
because
he
fell
off
a
rock
into
the
lake
and
so
dabbled
about
afterwards
while
his
clothes
were
drying
which
does
not
take
long
in
this
weather
this
also
accounts
for
the
condition
in
which
he
returned
to
camp
sans
bags
sans
shirt
sans
everything
barring
his
boots
late
at
night
esau
who
was
up
last
put
his
head
into
the
tent
to
remark
that
there
was
a
comet
on
view
but
he
was
received
with
such
execrations
from
the
other
two
lazy
people
in
bed
that
he
thought
it
prudent
to
say
no
more
about
it
and
not
to
look
at
it
any
more
himself
we
spent
the
morning
making
a
meat
safe
this
meat
safe
consists
of
a
hole
in
the
ground
neatly
flagged
with
flat
stones
and
walled
with
the
same
and
furnished
at
the
top
with
a
wooden
frame
into
which
fits
a
lid
with
hooks
underneath
it
for
birds
the
whole
is
covered
with
a
piece
of
muslin
to
keep
off
the
villanous
bluebottles
the
muslin
was
brought
to
make
into
mosquito
nets
inside
the
tent
but
in
this
happy
spot
the
skeeter
is
unknown
the
very
rare
and
the
great
möge
which
bites
a
lump
out
of
your
leg
and
then
flies
to
the
nearest
tree
to
eat
it
is
conspicuous
by
its
absence
we
have
always
been
very
careful
not
to
prepare
in
any
way
for
game
before
it
is
killed
but
this
usually
successful
plan
has
been
a
failure
this
year
so
now
we
are
desperate
and
have
made
a
safe
which
will
hold
a
reindeer
and
probably
with
a
little
more
bad
luck
shall
even
go
out
stalking
with
ropes
in
our
pockets
ready
to
tie
up
the
animal
when
killed
we
caught
öla
a
week
ago
carving
a
piece
of
stick
into
the
thing
that
butchers
put
between
the
legs
of
sheep
to
keep
them
apart
name
unknown
but
we
promptly
seized
it
and
made
it
into
the
handle
of
a
but
who
can
escape
his
destiny
we
hoped
that
we
had
averted
misfortune
but
the
deed
was
done
and
no
doubt
it
was
owing
to
this
that
the
skipper
failed
to
get
a
shot
at
the
store
when
john
and
esau
had
finished
the
safe
and
succeeded
in
catching
enough
nice
fish
for
the
requirements
of
the
camp
they
were
seized
with
the
desire
of
making
a
good
bath
we
have
no
near
the
camp
as
the
has
made
the
lake
too
shallow
round
its
mouth
and
it
is
some
distance
to
where
the
shore
becomes
bold
and
rocky
they
selected
a
nice
little
stream
on
the
hill
just
above
the
tent
and
toiled
like
navvies
there
for
about
four
hours
under
a
blazing
sun
excavating
and
paving
with
flat
stones
making
a
most
palatial
bath
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
when
behold
just
as
it
was
completed
to
use
the
graphic
language
of
one
of
the
constructors
may
i
be
dodderned
and
doggoned
and
dingblamed
by
pike
if
the
blooming
stream
didn
t
cease
to
run
it
did
just
supply
about
a
pint
of
water
before
it
quite
stopped
into
which
esau
s
watch
flew
as
he
flung
on
his
coat
with
some
slight
and
perhaps
excusable
show
of
temper
a
pint
of
water
is
not
enough
for
a
man
to
bathe
in
but
it
is
quite
sufficient
to
saturate
a
watch
especially
if
a
stone
obligingly
smashes
the
glass
and
makes
a
hole
in
its
face
obliterating
the
vii
viii
and
ix
at
the
time
of
its
immersion
however
he
dug
the
mud
out
of
the
works
filled
them
with
rangoon
oil
and
is
under
the
impression
that
that
watch
can
be
made
to
go
again
and
that
a
new
face
and
glass
and
silver
case
will
make
it
look
all
right
he
is
of
a
sanguine
disposition
they
returned
to
camp
saying
that
it
would
be
all
right
as
soon
as
the
first
rain
came
but
they
reckoned
without
their
host
the
stream
came
from
a
little
snowdrift
on
the
mountain
and
next
time
that
esau
went
up
there
he
found
that
the
heat
of
the
last
few
days
had
melted
it
all
away
hence
its
sudden
stop
it
never
ran
again
perchance
some
future
traveller
will
find
the
bath
ages
hence
and
rejoice
in
its
luxurious
arrangements
in
anticipation
of
this

beautiful

and
shed
a
tear
there
used
to
be
a

here
but
seeing
esau
strip
to
lave
his
sordid
body
neath
its
wave
all
filled
with
shame
and
blushing
red
the
streamlet
left
its
gravel
bed
its
only
wish
from
him
to
flee
it
ran
away
and
went
to

rather
late
with
some
very
good
fish

northern

about
nine
o
clock
a
splendid
display
of
northern
lights
was
produced
for
our
benefit
and
we
stayed
up
till
twelve
o
clock
baking
bread
and
gazing
at
the
beauties
of
this
glorious
sight
in
the
course
of
conversation
it
transpired
that
the
same
thing
happened
last
night
in
a
milder
form
and
it
was
this
that
esau
had
announced
as
a
comet
he
was
immensely
delighted
with
the
show
because
he
says
it
will
bring
good
luck
quoting
aurora
bright
dear
harbinger
of
he
said
this
was
shakespeare
and
if
shakespeare
called
aurora
a
deer
harbinger
that
ought
to
be
enough
for
us
the
other
two
agreed
but
did
not
believe
shakespeare
ever
wrote
that
or
anything
like

play
was

with
the
utmost
contempt

awful

dare
say
you
never
read
all
of
this
was
unanswerable
for
of
course
no
one
ever
did
read
all
the
sonnets
but
in
revenge
john
composed
some
poetry
about
esau
after
the
manner
of
walt
whitman
he
said
if
walt
whitman
ever
wrote
anything
like
this
he
ought
to
be
made
to
read
it
we
give
a
few
lines

who
culled
the
bluest

with
his
jodelling
made

oft
have
graced

would
deftly
roll
no

with
more
appetite

make
it
scarce

tired
nature
seeks
repose
in

to
lie
when
others
rise
and
calmly
rest
he
most
surpassed
the
seven

this
is
the
sort
of
rubbish
men
can
write
who
to
inanity
devote
their
minds
but
nought
save
great
experience
will
suffice
to
do
the
trick
no
amateur
can
hope
to
vie
with
those
who
ve
studied
it
from
and
so
on
for
pages
on
examining
the
diaries
which
we
all
keep
the
following
remarks
on
the
aurora
were
found
no
by
the
skipper
the
heavens
were
illuminated
by
most
brilliant
northern
lights
which
flickered
in
a
great
arch
over
the
starry
no
by
esau
a
most
glorious
display
of
northern
lights
huge
bands
of
light
across
the
sky
waving
flickering
and
disappearing
then
suddenly
shining
out
again
more
brilliantly
than
before
while
all
the
time
straight
streamers
of
light
were
shooting
upwards
from
the
no
by
john
the
glow
of
a
remarkably
fine
aurora
borealis
whose
silvery
shimmering
shafts
flickered
incessantly
all
over
the
heavens
in
the
most
fantastic
it
will
be
observed
that
we
all
agree
in
the
flickering
consequently
you
may
bet
it
flicker
but
for
this
fortunate
fact
it
would
be
hard
to
recognise
the
three
descriptions
as
identical
and
yet
this
is
the
way
history
is
written
chapter
xviii
success
at
last
this
was
a
most
eventful
day
in
our
quiet
life
and
one
fraught
with
episode
for
the
first
time
there
was
a
breeze
so
the
skipper
went
out
fishing
and
john
to
practise
canoeing
in
a
wind
which
is
an
art
requiring
considerable
dexterity
in
these
canadian
canoes
they
are
beautiful
sea
boats
and
beat
the
rob
roy
hollow
for
any
purposes
where
room
for
baggage
is
required
in
our
two
which
are
only
small
we
have
transported
between
and
lbs
but
their
worst
feature
is
decidedly
exhibited
in
a
wind
for
the
broad
flat
bottom
and
absence
of
keel
cause
them
to
drift
very
fast
and
make
it
difficult
to
keep
them
straight
it
can
only
be
done
by
paddling
from
amidships
instead
of
from
the
stern
esau
went
out
stalking
full
of
hope
from
the
aurora
and
the
favourable
wind
the
skipper
was
lucky
and
caught
some
very
good
fish
and
then
returning
to
camp
constructed
a
most
lovely
wimberry
tart
he
had
just
finished
the
enclosure
of
the
same
in
the
oven
and
was
proceeding
to
remove
the
flour
and
ashes
and
other
debris
from
his
hands
while
john
reclined
at
his
ease
under
an
awning
with
our
latest
field
three
weeks
old
when
they
heard
a
hail
overhead
and
behold
a
swarm
of
visitors
from
rus
vand
and
thomas
miss
a
and
their
friend
f
who
is
the
most
celebrated
deerstalker
in
the
country
he
is
reported
to
never
miss
a
shot
and
occasionally
shoots
flying
ryper
with
a
rifle
they
tumultuously
demanded
lunch
and
the
skipper
with
john
had
a
pretty
busy
time
of
it
for
about
twenty
minutes
and
the
wimberry
tart
had
to
be
left
to
its
fate
in
the
sultry
climate
of
the
oven
our
larder
just
now
is
not
well
supplied
with
anything
except
fish
so
that
the
utmost
exertions
could
only
produce
a
meal
which
to
people
who
have
had
reindeer
for
several
days
must
have
seemed
poor
indeed
fried
trout
skoggaggany
soup
tea
beer
bread
biscuits
and
marmalade
was
the
bill
of
fare
for
there
was
no
time
to
do
anything
in
the
gibier
line
birds
taking
some
time
to
pluck
and
clean
however
to
our
guests
there
were
some
points
of
this
meal
decidedly
worthy
of
attention
viz
the
beer
marmalade
and
bread
they
have
none
of
these
at
rus
vand
as
their
attempts
at
bread
have
hitherto
been
failures
while
ours
has
been
very
ever
since
the
oven
was
built
and
was
much
appreciated
we
have
been
informed
that
the
proper
thing
in
these
days
when
writing
a
book
is
to
recommend
some
condiment
or
patent
medicine
to
the
notice
of
the
confiding
public
as
there
is
no
chance
of
our
meeting
any
arab
sheiks
in
memurudalen
we
have
to
fall
back
on
this
episode
of
the
bread
and
seize
the
opportunity
to
sing
to
the
world
the
praises
of
yeatman
s
yeast
powder
by
far
the
best
that
we
have
tried
and
invaluable
on
an
expedition
of
this
kind
for
bread
pastry
and
pancakes
now
let
old
yeatman
send
his
hundred
guineas
care
of
esau
and
we
will
see
that
they
are
devoted
to
a
proper
use
to
return
to
our
guests
we
made
an
awning
on
what
we
call
the
lawn
size
six
feet
by
fourteen
feet
out
of
two
rugs
and
some
birch
poles
and
lunched
under
that
as
the
sun
was
cruelly
hot
there
was
a
good
deal
of
the
ordinary
picnic
about
the
meal
as
we
have
only
four
plates
cups
knives
and
had
to
eat
fish
out
of
the
and
drink
beer
out
of
a
jam
pot
and
a
tin
with
the
top
cut
off
and
the
sharp
edge
turned
down
but
all
these
drawbacks
were
met
in
the
true
picnic
spirit
which
de
minimis
non
curat
so
long
as
there
is
something
to
eat
our
two
last
bottles
of
beer
were
sacrificed
and
it
went
to
our
hearts
to
have
to
pour
away
our
beloved
skoggaggany
soup
when
the
cups
were
wanted
for
tea
for
our
visitors
did
not
go
for
the
soup
with
the
same
alacrity
that
distinguishes
us
possibly
it
occurred
to
them
that
the
middle
of
a
blazing
hot
august
day
was
not
the
most
suitable
time
for
highly
seasoned
substantial
nearly
boiling
liquid
to
be
poured
down
their
throats
and
thomas
and
miss
a
all
spoke
english
well
but
their
friend
young
f
could
neither
speak
it
nor
understand
it
however
he
wished
to
be
genial
and
polite
and
replied
oh
yase
tank
you
whenever
any
remark
was
made
to
him
in
consequence
of
this
amiable
trait
john
who
thought
he
could
talk
our
language
as
well
as
the
others
supplied
him
with
beer
whisky
and
water
tea
soup
and
marmalade
all
at
the
same
time
to
each
of
which
articles
when
offered
he
had
replied
oh
yase
tank
this
made
a
sad
run
on
our
limited
supply
of
crockery
lunch
ended
the
skipper
volunteered
as
usual
to
take
the
party
one
by
one
for
a
cruise
in
his
canoe
this
with
the
ordinary
english
lady
would
be
a
matter
of
considerable
risk
but
all
norwegians
ladies
as
well
as
men
are
accustomed
to
boats
and
very
nearly
all
of
them
can
swim
but
the
trip
was
quite
dangerous
enough
for
both
the
ladies
insisted
on
kneeling
in
the
right
position
and
paddling
themselves
and
there
was
a
good
sea
on
with
a
distant
threatening
storm
while
thomas
was
pursuing
her
adventurous
career
her
husband
danced
on
the
bank
after
the
manner
of
a
hen
with
ducklings
crying
come
back
come
back
you
go
too
far
out
but
we
grieve
to
record
that
she
did
not
care
a
little
bit
and
was
so
delighted
with
the
canoe
that
the
skipper
had
some
difficulty
in
persuading
her
to
return
may
she
live
long
to
paddle
that
canoe
for
it
now
belongs
to
her
about
four
o
clock
the
call
came
to
an
end
and
our
friends
departed
over
the
mountain
to
rus
vand
at
the
west
end
of
which
they
expected
to
meet
their
boat
before
going
they
made
us
promise
to
go
and
see
them
next
tuesday
and
will
send
a
boat
to
convey
us
down
the
lake
illustration
esau
and
ola
return
in
triumph
soon
after
six
esau
came
into
camp
in
an
offensively
jaunty
manner
followed
by
öla
with
the
heads
and
skins
and
what
the
lawyers
call
the
appurts
to
wit
the
heart
kidneys
feet
and
liver
of
two
reindeer
bucks
then
was
there
great
rejoicing
in
that
little
colony
and
dinner
was
served
and
disposed
of
with
light
hearts
even
the
neglected
wimberry
tart
being
a
complete
success
for
owing
to
its
gigantic
size
its
long
baking
in
a
cooling
oven
had
not
been
too
much
for
it
and
it
was
finished
to
the
last
crumb
of
paste
and
spoonful
of
juice
our
custom
is
when
a
man
returns
with
deer
that
he
shall
lie
on
the
sheepskin
of
indolence
if
so
disposed
while
the
other
fellows
prepare
dinner
and
after
the
meal
is
finished
and
men
are
beginning
to
lean
back
and
fill
their
pipes
he
is
expected
to
relate
his
adventures
without
interruption
after
this
he
is
never
to
refer
to
them
again
unless
specially
requested
now
for
esau
s
story
we
went
on
to
memurutungen
and
began
to
find
fresh
tracks
and
signs
of
deer
almost
directly
so
were
on
the
tiptoe
of
expectation
all
the
morning
about
midday
öla
found
two
deer
on
a
small
patch
of
snow
five
or
six
miles
from
camp
in
a
very
favourable
place
for
approaching
them
with
the
wind
as
right
as
it
could
be
we
made
a
lovely
stalk
but
when
after
an
hour
s
creeping
we
got
to
the
spot
we
were
just
in
time
to
see
them
disappear
slowly
feeding
over
the
hill
we
followed
as
fast
as
possible
and
soon
came
in
sight
of
them
again
for
as
the
deer
always
feed
against
the
wind
there
is
no
danger
of
alarming
them
by
following
on
their
tracks
a
few
minutes
of
breathless
crawling
like
serpents
and
we
were
within
yards
nearer
than
i
ever
got
to
reindeer
before
one
of
them
soon
gave
me
a
nice
side
shot
and
when
i
fired
he
almost
fell
but
recovered
himself
and
they
both
ran
down
the
hill
towards
a
little
glacier
i
fired
again
at
him
and
missed
and
then
ran
as
hard
as
i
could
towards
the
glacier
cramming
in
cartridges
as
i
ran
they
were
both
out
of
sight
for
a
moment
behind
some
rocks
and
then
the
unwounded
one
came
into
view
again
and
i
had
a
nice
shot
at
him
at
about
yards
and
was
lucky
enough
to
send
a
bullet
just
above
his
heart
which
killed
him
instantly
at
the
edge
of
the
glacier
illustration
a
careful
finishing
shot
i
ran
straight
on
and
following
round
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
saw
the
other
one
standing
about
yards
away
unable
to
go
any
further
i
was
in
about
the
same
state
myself
so
sat
down
took
as
careful
an
aim
as
i
could
and
fired
a
shot
which
finished
him
how
he
had
ever
got
so
far
is
a
mystery
as
the
first
shot
only
missed
his
heart
by
about
an
inch
the
second
went
in
touching
the
hole
made
by
the
first
and
killed
him
at
once
we
gralloched
them
and
built
the
meat
up
with
stones
to
preserve
it
from
ravens
and
the
great
bugbear
of
hunters
the
jarraf
as
they
call
it
filfras
is
its
english
name
i
think
it
is
identical
with
the
north
american
wolverine
or
the
lecturer
concluded
his
observations
amid
great
applause
let
it
be
understood
that
the
running
which
is
done
in
pursuit
of
deer
is
a
gymnastic
performance
of
the
utmost
difficulty
for
these
mountains
are
almost
entirely
composed
of
loose
stones
with
sharp
clean
edges
these
stones
vary
in
size
but
otherwise
are
all
similar
and
have
no
more
tendency
to
stick
together
and
lie
quiet
than
the
lumps
in
a
basin
of
sugar
so
that
running
over
them
means
for
an
extremely
active
man
a
pace
of
perhaps
four
miles
an
hour
for
a
deer
about
six
or
seven
consequently
the
deer
always
when
disturbed
try
to
get
on
to
snow
for
there
they
can
go
a
great
but
unascertained
pace
apparently
somewhere
about
eighty
miles
an
hour
we
find
that
after
all
we
were
quite
right
to
make
the
before
killing
the
deer
for
we
only
made
it
to
hold
one
and
now
we
have
killed
two
and
so
are
quite
properly
behindhand
with
our
arrangements
and
shall
be
obliged
to
make
another
after
dinner
esau
went
down
to
the
lake
and
tried
a
few
casts
from
the
shore
he
speedily
hooked
a
fish
which
he
thought
the
biggest
ever
made
and
never
got
a
sight
of
it
for
twenty
minutes
he
thought
this
a
grand
top
up
for
a
truly
successful
day
but
on
landing
it
it
only
weighed
a
pound
but
was
hooked
in
the
tail
hence
the
struggle
chapter
xix
gjendeboden
august
still
the
same
beautiful
weather
we
spent
the
morning
fishing
and
bathing
esau
distinguished
himself
by
falling
into
the
lake
off
a
cliff
just
as
he
had
finished
dressing
after
a
bath
nearly
swamping
his
canoe
full
of
fish
rugs
and
other
valuables
there
was
such
a
sun
that
he
merely
hung
his
things
on
the
rocks
and
went
on
fishing
without
them
until
they
were
dry
which
took
a
very
short
time
he
always
had
savage
tendencies
and
would
like
to
live
without
clothes
but
we
consider
this
is
not
dignified
and
will
not
tend
to
promote
discipline
among
our
retainers
the
skipper
got
the
best
bag
as
he
generally
does
on
a
calm
day
after
lunch
we
packed
our
rods
and
change
of
raiment
into
the
canoes
and
started
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
up
the
lake
intending
to
spend
the
night
at
gjendebod
a
hut
at
the
western
end
somewhat
similar
to
gjendesheim
at
the
eastern
though
not
so
large
or
so
well
built
for
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
does
not
get
as
many
visitors
as
the
lower
the
expedition
commenced
with
a
disaster
owing
no
doubt
to
its
being
sunday
as
john
and
esau
in
the
larger
canoe
were
crossing
the
glacier
stream
something
caused
the
boat
to
almost
swamp
but
fortunately
right
again
with
a
good
deal
of
water
in
it
esau
said
it
was
john
s
clumsiness
john
said
it
was
esau
s
recklessness
in
crossing
at
such
a
rapid
place
and
much
recrimination
ensued
they
went
to
shore
and
emptied
the
water
out
and
then
continued
the
voyage
nothing
being
wet
except
the
rugs
used
to
kneel
on
only
the
skipper
lingered
on
the
voyage
to
fish
the
other
two
paddling
against
a
heavy
head
wind
completed
the
journey
of
five
miles
in
about
an
hour
and
had
dinner
cooked
and
ready
by
the
time
the
skipper
made
his
appearance
with
a
beautiful
basket
of
trout
our
dinner
was
made
from
the
shoulder
of
venison
sent
us
by
thomas
it
was
utterly
ruined
in
the
cooking
for
we
are
getting
fastidious
after
our
own
luxurious
meals
and
think
as
poorly
of
gjendebod
cookery
as
a
certain
friend
of
ours
did
of
english
when
he
complained
that
in
all
the
houses
of
the
rich
and
great
which
he
had
ever
known
he
had
never
seen
a
decent
hot
dinner
served
except
when
they
had
it
cold
for
we
found
here
a
young
norwegian
who
spoke
english
well
and
gave
us
some
very
interesting
information
chiefly
about
the
winter
life
in
norway
also
a
very
intelligible
account
of
the
land
system
of
the
country
which
we
intend
to
send
to
gladstone
for
use
in
his
next
irish
land
bill
we
think
it
peculiarly
adapted
for
ireland
because
though
we
all
understood
it
perfectly
at
the
time
we
can
not
agree
about
any
of
its
main
features
on
comparing
notes
afterwards
presently
there
arrived
here
coutts
our
gjendesheim
acquaintance
who
had
made
the
extraordinary
walk
over
the
mountains
his
hair
had
either
not
grown
since
we
last
saw
him
or
else
he
had
it
off
again
he
had
just
achieved
another
remarkable
feat
this
was
a
climb
to
the
top
of
stor
skagastolstind
a
mountain
which
has
only
been
ascended
twice
previously
first
by
an
englishman
who
spends
most
of
his
time
in
doing
such
things
and
afterwards
by
a
norwegian
the
last
time
being
two
years
ago
many
others
have
tried
and
failed
the
ordinary
traveller
will
find
the
feat
of
pronouncing
its
name
fluently
in
the
course
of
conversation
quite
difficult
enough
but
it
can
be
done
by
the
exercise
of
an
iron
will
and
if
not
attempted
more
than
once
in
a
day
no
fatal
effects
need
be
apprehended
once
we
met
a
very
man
who
told
us
he
had
been
trying
to
make
a
pun
on
the
name
but
we
felt
no
pity
for
so
foolhardy
a
wretch
the
authorized
procedure
for
those
who
accomplish
the
ascent
is
to
enclose
their
name
and
some
coins
in
a
bottle
and
build
a
little
cairn
round
the
bottle
leaving
their
handkerchief
with
it
and
bringing
down
the
corresponding
articles
left
by
the
last
man
coutts
showed
us
the
handkerchief
and
bottle
which
he
found
on
the
top
but
the
coins
he
must
have
spent
in
drinks
on
his
way
home
or
else
did
not
like
to
trust
us
with
them
as
he
could
not
produce
them
he
had
of
course
left
his
own
handkerchief
and
john
who
is
short
of
these
useful
though
not
indispensable
articles
was
seized
with
a
great
longing
to
risk
his
life
and
go
to
the
summit
of
that
mountain
for
coutts
s
at
least
he
was
very
keen
about
it
immediately
after
the
description
of
the
ascent
and
hiding
of
the
treasure
but
since
he
became
calmer
we
almost
persuaded
him
not
to
go
as
he
hates
walking
especially
uphill
walking
it
takes
two
days
to
ascend
the
peak
one
to
get
down
again
and
the
whole
performance
is
slightly
more
difficult
and
hazardous
than
the
ascent
of
the
matterhorn
it
will
probably
be
unnecessary
to
remark
that
coutts
did
not
for
a
moment
condescend
to
follow
the
path
chosen
by
former
climbers
but
having
after
considerable
search
found
one
at
least
twice
as
dangerous
he
chose
that
as
he
had
not
time
to
look
for
a
worse
one
after
breakfast
we
found
a
drover
who
was
living
in
a
hut
here
and
impressed
him
to
come
out
with
us
after
ryper
his
function
being
that
of
the
dog
there
are
many
of
these
drovers
in
the
mountains
during
the
summer
they
get
cattle
how
we
do
not
know
whether
they
buy
them
or
merely
drive
them
on
commission
for
the
owners
then
they
feed
them
on
the
common
lands
and
drive
them
to
some
town
at
the
end
of
the
summer
the
huts
that
they
live
in
are
wretched
little
places
there
is
one
about
two
miles
from
our
camp
built
of
rough
stones
against
a
rock
which
forms
two
of
the
sides
without
any
door
or
window
and
only
a
hole
to
creep
in
at
no
englishman
would
keep
his
dog
in
such
a
place
unless
it
were
dead
but
we
are
told
that
a
drover
lived
there
for
a
month
this
year
before
we
came
and
it
is
considered
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
marked
on
the
ordnance
map
otherwise
we
should
never
have
seen
it
our
drover
however
was
rather
a
great
man
living
in
a
hut
with
a
real
door
and
a
window
and
a
live
woman
inside
to
cook
for
him
and
iron
his
shirt
at
least
we
imagined
she
must
be
doing
this
as
he
had
not
got
one
on
ryper
shooting
began
by
law
yesterday
but
our
sabbatarian
proclivities
prevented
us
from
going
forth
to
the
chase
the
true
reason
is
that
we
superstitiously
believe
it
will
rain
again
if
we
shoot
on
sunday
though
no
one
will
confess
that
this
is
the
feeling
by
which
we
are
possessed
we
crossed
the
lake
in
the
canoes
the
skipper
and
esau
to
shoot
john
and
herr
drover
to
beat
there
was
a
narrow
belt
of
birch
trees
between
the
lake
and
the
willow
belt
in
which
we
hoped
to
find
the
birds
and
before
we
got
through
this
our
ears
were
gladdened
by
the
sound
of
two
shots
from
esau
who
had
walked
on
to
two
old
birds
and
got
them
both
but
alas
disappointment
was
in
store
for
us
we
walked
up
hill
and
down
dale
dry
ground
and
marshy
willow
belt
and
birch
belt
but
never
saw
another
ryper
for
five
hours
and
then
we
put
up
one
old
cock
who
fled
away
with
a
derisive
crow
before
we
got
within
sixty
yards
of
him
it
is
hopeless
work
hunting
ryper
without
dogs
we
found
plenty
of
places
where
they
had
fed
or
sat
or
been
running
on
wet
ground
but
they
hate
flying
unless
they
are
compelled
and
on
a
day
of
this
sort
lie
like
stones
though
we
have
seen
them
after
windy
weather
get
up
almost
as
wild
as
yorkshire
grouse
but
we
feel
that
we
have
done
our
duty
in
trying
to
shoot
ryper
and
so
now
can
go
back
to
our
fishing
and
stalking
with
a
quiet
conscience
and
if
we
got
no
more
ryper
we
found
such
a
quantity
of
möltebær
that
there
is
every
prospect
of
esau
being
seriously
ill
for
some
days
which
would
be
a
distinct
gain
as
far
as
the
consumption
of
our
stores
goes
the
möltebær
is
a
berry
like
a
large
yellow
raspberry
very
good
indeed
to
eat
with
a
sort
of
honey
flavour
about
it
the
norwegians
think
it
better
than
the
strawberry
though
we
hardly
indorse
this
opinion
it
is
a
beautiful
scarlet
before
it
is
ripe
and
a
dirty
pale
yellow
when
ready
to
gather
it
grows
low
down
and
is
difficult
to
find
as
it
conceals
itself
in
low
swampy
and
rather
dark
places
when
we
returned
from
the
pursuit
of
the
disobliging
ryper
there
was
a
fair
breeze
down
the
lake
so
we
hoisted
sails
and
were
soon
back
at
memurudalen
chapter
xx
a
formal
call
this
was
the
day
appointed
for
our
visit
to
the
thomas
s
at
rus
vand
but
though
we
told
öla
as
usual
to
call
us
at
he
never
came
until
about
eight
his
watch
is
a
curiosity
among
bad
watches
he
sets
it
by
one
of
ours
every
night
and
it
has
always
gained
or
lost
several
hours
before
morning
on
one
occasion
it
actually
lost
nearly
a
fortnight
while
we
slept
the
skipper
says
it
ain
t
worth
a
smothered
oath
and
this
morning
as
we
specially
wished
to
get
up
early
and
did
get
up
owing
to
öla
s
watch
more
than
usually
late
he
is
getting
lower
in
his
valuation
and
estimates
it
at
a
whispered
d
we
have
begged
öla
to
pawn
it
or
refrain
from
winding
it
up
but
without
effect
and
esau
lent
him
his
which
has
never
moved
since
its
bath
and
is
fixed
at
this
was
very
successful
for
two
days
as
it
made
öla
call
us
about
six
o
clock
and
we
had
lots
of
time
to
go
to
sleep
again
afterwards
but
after
that
the
discontented
fellow
came
and
asked
for
one
that
would
go
faster
and
of
course
we
have
nothing
that
will
compare
with
his
own
either
at
trotting
or
cantering
first
thing
this
morning
the
skipper
was
seen
shaving
his
meagre
chin
with
no
little
care
and
reflecting
himself
with
considerable
interest
in
a
slip
of
that
he
keeps
under
his
pillow
we
all
made
elaborate
toilets
but
the
skipper
was
especially
beautiful
by
reason
of
his
necktie
and
the
least
of
his
two
coats
which
he
wore
with
what
he
considered
a
careless
grace
we
started
up
the
mountain
at
ten
and
arrived
on
the
shores
of
rus
vand
very
hot
and
tired
in
about
two
hours
there
we
saw
a
dim
speck
on
the
distant
horizon
which
we
imagined
to
be
the
boat
coming
to
take
us
down
the
lake
so
we
began
to
fish
till
it
should
arrive
and
it
was
a
considerable
time
before
we
realised
the
fact
that
the
speck
we
had
seen
was
indeed
the
boat
but
it
was
not
coming
for
the
soulless
wretch
who
had
control
of
it
had
presumed
to
think
and
his
thoughts
being
of
course
the
mere
unreasoning
impulses
of
a
brutish
and
degraded
mind
had
caused
him
to
suppose
we
were
not
coming
this
was
a
terrible
blow
but
at
last
we
bravely
decided
to
walk
on
to
the
hut
about
eight
miles
during
the
next
six
pages
of
this
book
we
walked
and
walked
and
walked
with
hunger
and
thirst
raging
inside
us
a
broiling
sun
over
our
heads
and
the
most
frightful
language
proceeding
from
our
lips
tramping
along
cattle
tracks
wading
through
mountain
torrents
and
stumbling
over
willows
and
rocks
till
about
three
in
the
afternoon
when
turning
the
last
corner
we
came
on
the
two
huts
and
our
olfactory
nerves
were
greeted
by
the
welcome
scent
of
adjacent
cooking
food
thomas
was
most
profuse
in
his
maledictions
of
the
idiot
who
had
left
the
west
end
of
the
lake
without
waiting
for
us
and
we
had
great
difficulty
in
persuading
him
not
to
shed
his
blood
there
and
then
thus
far
the
misery
but
now
a
change
came
o
er
the
scene
behold
the
wearied
travellers
lying
on
the
sward
in
the
cool
shadow
cast
by
the
hut
surrounded
by
iced
whisky
punch
brandy
and
water
rum
and
milk
and
claret
and
drinking
them
all
at
once
under
the
entreaties
of
our
hospitable
entertainers
anon
a
sumptuous
feast
was
spread
under
the
canopy
of
a
tent
pitched
just
above
the
roaring
waters
of
the
russen
river
where
it
leaves
the
calm
of
the
lake
for
the
turmoil
and
trouble
of
a
hurried
descent
to
busier
regions
that
trout
reindeer
roast
ryper
and
the
various
smaller
birds
will
be
remembered
by
all
of
us
as
long
as
we
live
the
skipper
confessed
afterwards
that
all
along
that
burning
shadeless
cattle
track
with
its
atmosphere
perfectly
blue
with
execrations
he
had
thought
that
life
was
but
a
wale
of
tears
at
the
best
of
times
but
when
after
dinner
cigars
and
black
coffee
were
produced
he
began
to
believe
we
had
had
rather
a
pleasant
walk
after
all
we
left
the
hospitable
hut
about
six
in
the
boat
thomas
himself
and
jens
coming
with
us
jens
rowed
and
we
four
fished
all
the
way
up
the
lake
so
that
the
water
was
stiff
with
minnows
and
flies
john
with
a
minnow
caught
one
trout
and
some
smaller
ones
and
the
skipper
and
esau
several
good
fish
with
the
fly
but
we
had
no
time
to
really
try
to
catch
fish
but
kept
rowing
steadily
on
and
getting
what
we
could
on
the
way
thomas
got
out
halfway
up
the
lake
to
fish
from
the
bank
and
john
at
once
trampled
on
a
spare
rod
which
had
been
brought
in
the
boat
and
reduced
it
to
matchwood
then
to
witness
john
s
polite
protestations
and
apologies
from
the
boat
to
thomas
on
shore
was
truly
gratifying
to
us
as
spectators
when
they
were
concluded
we
rowed
on
to
the
end
of
the
lake
climbed
over
the
dreadful
mountain
which
was
by
no
means
a
pleasant
task
in
the
dark
and
reached
camp
at
ten
just
twelve
hours
employed
in
making
a
formal
call
think
of
that
ye
gentlemen
of
england
who
grumble
at
having
to
leave
a
card
on
the
people
the
other
side
of
the
square
we
all
stayed
at
home
as
the
weather
although
still
perfectly
fine
was
not
favourable
for
any
sort
of
sport
with
which
we
are
acquainted
except
and
the
tent
was
constantly
in
such
imminent
danger
of
being
blown
from
its
moorings
that
we
feared
if
we
went
away
we
should
not
be
able
to
find
it
when
we
came
back
it
was
great
fun
during
breakfast
to
watch
ivar
sailing
after
our
goods
and
chattels
whenever
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
sent
them
scudding
over
the
ground
till
brought
to
a
standstill
by
a
juniper
or
a
rock
before
starting
in
pursuit
he
always
opened
his
mouth
to
its
utmost
width
which
is
enormous
and
then
extending
his
arms
and
legs
till
he
looked
like
a
demoniac
he
swooped
down
on
the
quarry
never
failing
to
secure
the
article
or
towel
or
whatever
it
might
be
the
skipper
was
the
only
one
who
attempted
fishing
and
he
had
but
poor
sport
and
soon
returned
to
camp
to
assist
in
the
operations
there
going
on
the
most
important
of
these
was
the
construction
of
a
new
game
cellar
in
the
ground
near
the
old
one
esau
was
bossing
this
thing
while
öla
worked
esau
being
very
lazy
himself
takes
a
fiendish
delight
in
getting
any
work
out
of
öla
and
now
his
portion
of
the
job
seemed
to
be
standing
with
an
axe
in
his
hand
revolving
things
in
his
great
mind
while
öla
undertook
the
labour
the
skipper
and
john
devoted
themselves
to
baking
and
produced
an
enormous
quantity
of
bread
and
biscuits
and
when
these
were
finished
the
united
strength
of
the
company
engaged
itself
on
a
meat
pie
the
division
of
labour
in
this
enterprise
is
always
managed
thus
esau
is
butcher
an
employment
in
which
he
revels
and
at
which
he
is
decidedly
an
adept
he
cuts
up
reindeer
in
convenient
slices
for
placing
in
the
adding
thereto
slices
of
bacon
and
two
or
three
eggs
with
some
liver
heart
and
birds
if
we
have
any
to
spare
meanwhile
the
skipper
concocts
the
dough
for
the
crust
from
flour
butter
and
boiling
water
and
after
rolling
the
same
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
boxes
with
an
empty
neatly
lines
the
smaller
of
the
two
low
tins
with
it
fills
it
with
the
various
ingredients
and
plenty
of
pepper
salt
and
some
water
and
then
covers
it
with
a
thin
disc
of
paste
perforated
with
holes
and
adorned
with
fantastic
images
of
reindeer
and
birds
now
the
pie
is
ready
for
the
oven
which
all
this
time
john
has
been
stoking
indefatigably
with
arm
loads
of
wood
and
when
he
announces
that
the
oven
is
fit
the
pie
is
borne
in
solemn
procession
to
it
and
safely
enclosed
by
the
sod
which
acts
as
the
oven
door
and
conceals
it
from
our
gaze
for
a
time
which
varies
according
to
the
size
of
the
pie
and
heat
of
the
oven
we
have
some
difficulties
to
contend
with
in
the
top
of
our
oven
for
the
sods
which
fill
in
the
holes
thereof
are
liable
to
crumble
with
the
intense
heat
and
fall
down
in
fine
dust
on
our
food
gently
stewing
in
its
cosy
nest
the
only
way
to
obviate
this
is
to
water
the
top
of
the
oven
every
morning
as
if
it
were
a
spring
garden
and
then
the
clods
never
get
dry
enough
to
play
their
evil
little
games
the
skipper
compares
the
baking
of
a
pie
to
burial
by
cremation
if
that
is
not
a
bull
certainly
it
always
comes
out
etherealised
a
thing
of
beauty
and
a
joy
for
at
least
two
days
esau
called
this
pie
after
its
resurrection
a
harmony
in
yellow
and
brown
quite
too
too
utter
and
distinctly
precious
and
john
added
begorra
me
jewel
it
is
that
same
illustration
the
colony
at
breakfast
in
memurudalen
we
shall
now
be
free
to
do
what
seems
good
in
our
eyes
for
several
days
without
the
trouble
of
baking
altogether
our
stock
of
provisions
is
enormous
this
is
always
the
way
in
camp
life
first
a
week
of
existence
on
the
verge
of
starvation
and
then
a
time
of
milk
and
honey
and
tables
overflowing
with
plenty
some
of
the
bread
that
john
makes
is
rather
heavy
yesterday
we
were
constrained
to
point
this
fact
out
to
him
he
pretended
not
to
be
able
to
see
it
and
in
support
of
his
theory
ate
at
supper
a
quantity
of
the
rolls
that
we
had
condemned
the
consequence
was
that
about
two
o
clock
we
were
roused
from
our
peaceful
slumbers
by
john
jumping
spasmodically
out
of
bed
and
rushing
to
the
tent
door
uttering
at
the
same
time
most
ghastly
yells
at
the
door
he
appeared
to
be
awake
so
we
said
sitting
up
in
bed
with
our
hair
on
end
then
john
what
s
the
row
to
which
he
answered
very
quietly
why
my
line
s
caught
on
that
rock
over
there
i
wish
you
would
stop
the
boat
a
then
he
went
gently
to
bed
again
and
continued
his
unbroken
slumbers
a
sleeping
man
is
selfishly
regardless
of
the
disquiet
he
brings
on
his
and
john
although
he
must
have
dreamt
all
sorts
of
funny
things
did
not
dream
that
he
was
disturbing
our
night
s
rest
the
other
night
when
we
were
returning
from
our
visit
to
rus
vand
john
casually
seated
himself
on
a
rock
at
the
extreme
top
of
the
mountain
it
was
quite
dark
except
for
a
subdued
glow
of
light
caused
by
the
setting
moon
behind
the
mountains
on
the
other
side
of
gjendin
lake
now
the
skipper
and
esau
take
a
good
deal
of
interest
in
moons
because
they
are
considerably
affected
by
the
pallid
luminary
when
at
the
full
consequently
they
were
aware
that
she
had
already
passed
her
highest
point
for
that
night
and
would
not
show
above
the
peaks
until
the
following
evening
but
john
did
not
know
this
and
so
when
we
asked
his
reason
for
sitting
down
on
a
very
sharp
and
cold
stone
feet
above
sea
level
with
the
quicksilver
right
through
the
bottom
of
the
thermometer
at
a
time
when
all
honest
folk
were
in
bed
he
replied
you
fellows
go
on
i
m
going
to
wait
here
and
see
the
moon
we
never
disturb
a
man
when
he
feels
poetical
lest
it
should
break
out
in
some
more
dangerous
form
so
we
left
him
on
his
cold
grey
stone
and
made
the
best
of
our
way
to
camp
when
we
had
about
half
finished
our
soup
he
came
struggling
and
wading
in
through
the
shrubs
and
swamp
and
sat
down
to
supper
without
making
any
remarks
about
the
scenery
neither
did
he
touch
upon
the
subject
of
silver
shafts
or
shimmering
sheen
or
a
network
of
frosted
filigree
chaining
down
the
ripples
he
was
evidently
disappointed
about
something
and
we
possessed
too
much
delicacy
of
feeling
to
ask
what
was
wrong
and
so
the
matter
dropped
but
at
breakfast
this
morning
the
skipper
happened
to
tell
a
story
about
a
man
he
knew
who
waited
on
the
quay
for
some
friends
who
had
arrived
in
a
steamer
that
day
this
man
had
ordered
a
sumptuous
banquet
directly
the
steamer
was
signalled
then
waited
three
hours
expecting
a
boat
to
come
off
every
minute
but
at
last
perceived
that
a
curious
flag
was
flying
on
the
steamer
and
on
inquiry
found
that
she
was
quarantined
for
a
fortnight
then
esau
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
and
remarked
just
like
waiting
for
the
moon
to
rise
when
she
ain
t
due
over
the
mountains
for
hours
and
the
harmony
of
the
meeting
at
once
ceased
to
exist
the
skipper
went
after
deer
but
only
had
a
very
long
walk
without
seeing
any
we
have
now
got
the
kitchen
into
a
great
state
of
perfection
so
that
within
ten
minutes
of
his
return
a
recherché
repast
was
on
the
table
this
is
rather
a
difficult
thing
to
manage
as
we
never
know
to
within
a
couple
of
hours
what
time
the
hunters
will
return
but
it
can
be
done
by
having
the
chops
steaks
or
birds
ready
in
one
the
trout
in
the
other
the
potatoes
partially
cooked
and
the
tea
or
coffee
made
the
leaves
or
grounds
of
the
latter
we
remove
always
after
eight
minutes
brewing
so
that
it
does
not
alter
by
standing
the
table
of
course
is
ready
laid
once
and
only
once
there
was
a
long
delay
owing
to
a
misfortune
with
the
water
that
had
been
boiled
for
the
tea
but
the
explosion
of
wrath
from
the
famishing
hunter
on
that
occasion
was
so
dreadful
that
the
utmost
endeavours
have
since
been
successfully
used
to
prevent
its
recurrence

pancakes
our
procedure
with
pancakes
is
for
every
man
to
fry
and
toss
his
own
the
frying
of
the
first
side
is
easy
enough
but
the
tossing
requires
skill
for
we
do
not
allow
the
mean
practice
of
helping
the
delicacy
over
with
a
knife
indulged
in
by
some
cooks
john
s
first
became
a
mangled
heap
of
batter
under
his
repeated
efforts
and
was
finally
eaten
by
him
in
that
condition
his
second
ascended
towards
the
heavens
most
gracefully
when
he
tossed
and
was
absent
for
some
minutes
but
unfortunately
he
failed
to
hold
the
pan
in
the
right
place
on
its
return
and
it
fell
on
the
ground
where
it
was
immediately
seized
and
devoured
by
ivar
the
third
was
a
complete
success
and
so
were
the
fourth
fifth
sixth
and
seventh
the
eighth
stuck
to
the
pan
and
was
a
failure
and
after
that
he
got
along
all
right
to
the
when
he
had
another
partial
failure
owing
to
this
made
him
more
careful
and
all
the
rest
were
quite
perfect
when
we
had
finished
we
gave
the
rest
of
the
batter
to
the
men
who
fried
it
all
in
one
huge
pancake
about
two
inches
thick
we
notice
that
all
the
diaries
agree
for
once
the
following
note
occurs
in
all
pancakes
for
dinner
the
other
two
fellows
we
told
john
this
morning
of
his
adventure
with
the
boat
and
fishing
line
during
the
night
so
he
ate
all
the
new
bread
at
lunch
thereby
laying
its
restless
spirit
long
before
bedtime
no
doubt
he
and
his
dinner
will
slumber
more
peacefully
it
may
be
remembered
that
we
brought
a
lot
of
fish
slightly
salted
with
us
from
gjendesheim
ever
since
our
return
here
we
have
caught
plenty
of
fish
every
day
and
as
we
prefer
fresh
food
to
salt
the
gjendesheim
fish
which
were
placed
in
a
little
barrel
have
been
neglected
five
or
six
days
ago
we
noticed
an
unpleasant
odour
and
found
that
it
proceeded
from
this
barrel
the
fish
being
in
an
advanced
stage
of
decomposition
and
the
men
told
us
they
were
making
raki
fiske
a
thing
which
they
informed
us
in
norwegian
is
real
we
were
very
angry
and
gave
orders
that
the
whole
thing
should
at
once
be
thrown
into
the
glacier
torrent
after
this
the
affair
faded
from
our
minds
but
yesterday
we
again
noticed
a
suspicion
of
the
same
smell
and
this
morning
it
was
so
powerful
that
we
began
to
invent
theories
to
account
for
it
john
who
is
a
man
of
great
scientific
attainments
proved
to
his
own
complete
satisfaction
that
it
proceeded
from
the
bodies
of
prehistoric
reindeer
which
had
been
engulfed
by
an
avalanche
ages
ago
and
entombed
in
the
glacier
until
now
when
at
last
their
decaying
corpses
were
being
washed
down
the
stream
he
said
huxley
had
often
observed
the
same
thing
and
told
him
about
it
esau
s
theory
was
that
the
glacier
itself
was
decomposing
look
what
a
long
time
it
had
been
standing
exposed
to
the
air
and
most
likely
in
a
damp
place
everybody
knew
that
snow
water
was
not
good
to
drink
witness
the
goître
of
switzerland
and
why
was
it
not
good
simply
because
it
was
putrid
and
now
that
the
hot
sun
was
shining
upon
it
no
wonder
it
smelt
a
he
concluded
his
remarks
by
inquiring
who
huxley
might
be
and
was
just
setting
off
up
the
valley
with
a
bottle
of
condy
s
fluid
to
pour
over
the
glacier
when
the
skipper
who
had
wandered
down
to
the
memurua
river
instead
of
arguing
suddenly
rushed
back
with
his
fingers
tightly
holding
his
nose
and
shaking
his
fist
at
öla
said
something
that
began
with
dab
and
went
on
with
other
unknown
words
at
last
we
gathered
from
his
expressions
that
the
barrel
of
raki
fiske
had
not
been
thrown
into
the
torrent
at
all
but
our
villanous
retainers
had
secreted
it
near
the
stream
intending
to
have
a
feast
as
soon
as
it
should
have
become
rotten
enough
to
please
their
cultivated
taste
truly
a
norwegian
has
the
nastiest
notions
of
food
now
the
raki
fiske
barrel
and
all
is
buried
a
yard
deep
a
long
way
from
here
and
life
is
again
pleasant
but
we
have
little
doubt
that
öla
and
ivar
will
come
back
and
root
about
and
dig
it
up
after
we
have
left
the
country
say
a
month
hence
it
ought
to
be
in
perfect
condition
by
that
time
chapter

fishing
the
first
thing
this
morning
we
sent
öla
to
gjendesheim
with
some
venison
for
the
people
there
who
have
been
very
kind
in
sending
milk
eggs
rice
onions
to
us
we
have
more
meat
than
we
shall
be
able
to
eat
if
the
weather
continues
as
fine
and
hot
as
it
is
at
present
we
three
walked
over
the
mountain
to
spend
the
day
at
rus
vand
taking
our
lunch
with
us
we
got
there
about
ten
and
the
fish
were
then
rising
well
so
we
separated
and
commenced
fishing
the
skipper
and
john
taking
the
north
side
of
the
lake
esau
the
south
after
catching
a
few
fish
the
rise
stopped
as
it
always
does
on
these
lakes
about
midday
illustration
an
exciting
moment
in
rus
lake
shallows
there
is
no
doubt
that
on
a
norwegian
lake
the
fisherman
should
above
all
things
make
haste
while
the
fish
it
is
all
very
well
for
the
ancient
sportsman
to
remark
take
your
time
my
young
friend
there
are
as
good
fish
in
the
sea
as
ever
came
out
of
it
is
no
doubt
true
enough
but
at
this
time
of
year
they
will
not
rise
to
fly
for
more
than
about
a
couple
of
hours
twice
a
day
and
if
you
do
not
make
the
best
of
your
opportunities
then
where
are
you
put
yourself
in
the
place
of
the
fine
old
veteran
who
has
got
into
the
habit
of
taking
his
meals
at
regular
hours
for
fear
of
spoiling
his
digestion
and
has
selected
the
hours
between
and
and
and
because
he
knows
from
long
experience
that
these
are
the
most
likely
times
to
find
flies
on
the
water
he
has
come
in
from
roaming
in
deep
waters
to
the
shades
of
the
rocky
coast
and
has
a
certain
appetite
to
allay
after
his
bath
and
morning
stroll
there
he
waits
and
thinks
of
old
times
and
of
how
fat
and
shiny
his
tummy
became
the
last
hot
summer
there
was
when
flies
were
plentiful
and
he
had
not
to
resort
to
this
abominable
device
of
catching
small
trout
and
eating
mice
to
keep
him
in
daily
food
as
he
nearly
always
has
to
do
now
that
the
summers
are
so
wet
and
he
is
no
longer
active
enough
to
compete
with
his
younger
relations
in
the
struggle
for
existence
what
times
those
were
and
how
he
wishes
he
were
a
year
or
two
younger
again
and
not
crippled
with
useless
length
and
by
george
now
he
comes
to
look
at
his
reflection
against
that
stone
he
s
getting
quite
yellow
and
bilious
under
the
belly
and
but
he
can
t
stop
to
moralise
there
is
a
luscious
march
brown
of
unusual
solidity
skating
right
over
his
pet
rock
and
he
can
t
let
it
pass
so
up
he
comes
and
gulps
it
down
with
a
lazy
flop
of
his
tail
that
leaves
quite
a
swirl
on
the
lake
surface
why
the
thing
s
got
no
flavour
and
how
i
ve
hurt
my
jaw
with
it
poor
old
chap
his
day
is
over
and
after
ten
minutes
struggle
he
has
left
his
favourite
haunt
to
be
occupied
by
another
tenant
and
is
safe
in
the
landing
net
a
good
fish
but
like
most
of
those
who
have
reached
this
size
not
quite
in
as
good
condition
as
he
was
at
and
just
a
shade
longer
than
he
ought
to
be
don
t
stop
to
gaze
at
him
put
him
in
the
bag
with
all
speed
it
is
necessary
to
hurry
up
and
fish
on
while
the
rise
lasts
footnote
we
have
found
as
many
as
three
mice
in
the
stomach
of
a
rus
vand
trout
but
all
this
time
the
hours
have
been
slipping
away
and
we
have
lunched
and
smoked
and
sketched
till
the
rise
began
again
soon
after
four
and
though
there
was
a
strong
cold
west
wind
the
change
seemed
to
encourage
the
fish
to
feed
more
greedily
than
usual
for
trout
are
terrible
radicals
and
rejoice
in
any
alteration
of
the
existing
condition
of
things
illustration
esau
s
best
day
among
the
trout
our
old
experience
of
rus
vand
taught
us
that
one
side
was
and
interesting
while
the
other
was
bleak
and
ugly
but
esau
who
took
the
ugly
side
had
much
the
best
of
it
as
the
place
seemed
alive
with
fish
and
he
kept
catching
them
all
the
time
so
that
his
little
rod
was
continually
to
be
seen
in
the
form
of
a
hoop
from
which
position
it
reassumed
the
perpendicular
in
a
way
that
reflects
no
little
credit
on
farlow
when
we
met
again
at
the
end
of
the
lake
on
our
way
home
we
found
that
we
had
twenty
fish
weighing
just
of
which
esau
had
caught
fifteen
weighing
the
skipper
four
of
lbs
weight
and
john
who
was
very
unlucky
only
a
single
the
smallest
of
the
bag
was
a
little
over
a
pound
the
largest
three
pounds
which
was
reached
by
more
than
one
and
nearly
all
were
caught
in
water
so
shallow
that
the
dorsal
fin
of
the
fish
was
often
visible
in
his
mad
rushes
hither
and
thither
this
made
it
extremely
difficult
to
prevent
the
being
hung
up
on
a
rock
whenever
the
fish
was
hooked
on
the
dropper
and
not
a
few
were
lost
in
this
manner
all
were
caught
on
two
patterns
of
fly
namely
no
philanthropy
has
limits
and
no
man
can
expect
to
be
told
patterns
of
flies
go
to
norway
and
the
time
and
trouble
spent
in
acquiring
that
knowledge
will
be
amply
repaid
by
the
pleasure
that
no
one
could
fail
to
derive
from
a
visit
no
doubt
with
the
usual
discontentedness
of
man
we
shall
regret
for
ever
that
we
did
not
all
go
to
the
ugly
side
of
the
lake
of
which
esau
was
obliged
to
leave
the
best
piece
untouched
as
he
came
back
from
sheer
inability
to
carry
any
more
fish
over
the
rough
ground
but
the
ways
of
fish
are
inscrutable
we
hardly
ever
caught
any
number
on
that
side
before
and
probably
shall
not
do
so
again
it
was
just
esau
s
day
kismet
after
weighing
our
catch
we
cleaned
them
and
cut
off
their
heads
to
lighten
them
for
the
journey
over
glopit
and
even
without
this
extra
weight
we
were
a
good
deal
troubled
and
felt
overburdened
on
the
uphill
side
which
is
terribly
steep
and
rough
only
just
practicable
for
a
man
on
foot
when
we
got
back
to
camp
we
found
that
öla
had
not
returned
from
gjendesheim
which
caused
us
some
sorrow
as
esau
wanted
to
go
out
stalking
on
the
morrow
and
could
not
go
alone
at
least
he
would
be
extremely
unlikely
to
see
any
deer
for
the
reindeer
being
exactly
the
same
colour
as
the
mountains
among
which
they
live
it
is
almost
impossible
to
see
them
before
they
see
the
enemy
and
depart
hastily
these
native
hunters
are
wonderful
at
the
profession
and
seem
to
know
by
instinct
when
they
are
in
the
vicinity
of
deer
as
if
they
could
feel
their
presence
in
the
air
no
doubt
they
really
see
indications
that
we
should
never
observe
for
they
always
begin
to
go
cautiously
crouching
and
peering
over
rocks
when
deer
are
about
long
before
we
amateurs
are
aware
from
the
ordinary
signs
of
footprints
nibbled
reindeer
flowers
or
newly
moved
stones
that
there
is
likely
to
be
any
sport
plate
on
the
top
of
glopit
returning
from
rus
lake
it
was
cold
and
windy
last
night
so
we
turned
into
bed
early
and
lay
in
luxurious
comfort
while
john
read
out
choice
bits
all
of
which
we
know
by
heart
from
the
works
of
mark
twain
we
all
think
mark
twain
the
best
writer
for
camp
life
that
has
yet
been
discovered
and
we
have
three
or
four
of
his
books
here
besides
these
our
library
of
light
literature
consists
of
shakespeare
longfellow
johnson
s
and
novels
by
whyte
melville
walford
and
thackeray
but
mark
and
william
get
more
work
than
all
the
rest
it
is
quite
dark
now
during
the
night
and
we
have
made
a
wooden
chandelier
out
of
a
curiously
bent
piece
of
birch
wood
which
holds
two
candles
and
hangs
down
from
the
ridge
pole
by
a
string
in
the
daytime
it
is
hoisted
up
to
the
roof
but
at
night
we
let
it
down
till
it
swings
about
two
feet
above
our
heads
as
we
lie
in
bed
this
contrivance
is
capital
for
reading
and
also
affords
considerable
diversion
to
the
last
man
into
bed
the
candles
are
just
too
high
to
be
reached
with
a
puff
easily
from
a
recumbent
position
and
yet
we
persistently
try
to
blow
them
out
without
moving
just
as
sleep
is
creeping
over
two
of
the
wearied
sportsmen
the
last
man
begins
blowing
and
cussing
at
these
candles
every
night
regularly
the
scene
is
generally
this
skipper
and
john
just
dropping
off
to
sleep
esau
lies
down
makes
himself
extremely
comfortable
and
then

swings

under

and
we
all
turn
over
with
a
sigh
of
relief
to
repeat
the
performance
the
following
night
öla
not
having
turned
up
there
could
be
no
stalking
so
the
beautiful
morning
was
wasted
the
skipper
got
so
angry
about
it
that
he
said
he
would
go
in
his
canoe
to
find
the
absentee
and
take
at
the
same
time
a
lot
of
our
surplus
fish
for
the
people
at
gjendesheim
leaving
the
tent
on
its
grassy
sunlit
lawn
he
walked
down
to
the
edge
of
the
great
lake
and
turning
over
the
smaller
of
the
two
canoes
which
were
lying
bottom
uppermost
launched
her
and
got
in
with
rod
and
fishing
bag
and
pushed
off
into
the
deep
opposite
to
the
place
where
the
canoes
were
drawn
up
and
apparently
only
a
hundred
yards
distant
though
really
more
than
a
mile
away
were
the
mountain
steeps
that
rise
almost
perpendicularly
from
two
to
three
thousand
feet
out
of
the
lake
and
for
these
he
made
gradually
becoming
a
mere
twinkling
speck
till
he
faded
out
of
sight
from
the
tent
the
lake
was
as
smooth
as
glass
only
occasionally
rippled
as
some
monarch
of
the
deep
excited
for
once
in
his
life
by
some
specially
fascinating
fly
condescended
to
make
a
rush
for
it
instead
of
the
gentle
suck
by
which
he
usually
took
his
food
and
the
skipper
paddled
leisurely
along
within
twenty
yards
of
the
rocks
with
his
rod
bending
over
the
stern
and
trailing
behind
a
couple
of
flies
in
the
hope
of
catching
a
trout
without
the
trouble
of
angling
for
him
it
is
very
pleasant
to
be
alone
once
in
a
way
in
this
overcrowded
world
not
alone
as
it
is
possible
to
be
in
england
but
absolutely
alone
with
no
living
thing
near
except
the
trout
the
insects
and
one
s
image
in
the
water
oh
blessed
norway
when
we
get
back
to
the
turmoils
troubles
and
pleasures
of
a
london
season
how
we
shall
long
for
you
there
is
only
one
word
to
express
this
existence
and
that
is
freedom
freedom
from
care
freedom
from
resistance
and
from
the
struggle
for
life
what
a
country
where
civilised
man
can
relapse
as
much
as
seems
good
to
him
into
his
natural
state
and
retrograde
a
hundred
generations
into
his
primeval
condition
but
we
forget
that
the
skipper
is
coasting
up
towards
gjendesheim
in
search
of
the
miscreant
öla
he
proceeded
for
a
couple
of
hours
catching
a
few
fish
now
and
then
but
presently
as
midday
approached
the
sun
became
too
hot
to
be
pleasant
the
fish
would
not
move
and
the
skipper
began
to
get
impatient
and
annoyed
at
not
meeting
öla
after
a
while
a
black
speck
with
two
flashing
arms
appeared
rounding
a
promontory
this
was
öla
in
the
boat
the
skipper
was
boiling
with
rage
under
the
influence
of
various
incentives
as
he
approached
öla
like
most
norwegians
was
calm
placid
and
utterly
unconscious
of
the
flight
of
time
and
the
shortness
of
life
the
skipper
had
been
primed
to
exploding
point
by
his
two
friends
before
starting
and
as
he
had
now
paddled
five
miles
from
home
without
meeting
the
adversary
he
was
to
put
it
mildly
so
when
he
found
öla
smoking
serenely
and
sculling
along
as
though
his
brief
span
were
going
to
stretch
through
the
unending
cycles
of
eternity
he
gave
way
to
the
most
horrible
outbreak
of
temper
in
english
which
must
have
lasted
four
or
five
minutes
and
then
telling
the
caitiff
in
norwegian
to
take
the
fish
to
gjendesheim
and
return
to
camp
by
five
o
clock
whatever
the
weather
might
be
he
turned
and
left
that
hardy
norseman
and
bewildered
looking
as
though
he
had
seen
the
strömkarl
or
had
had
an
interview
with
his
then
a
great
wind
arose
and
blew
against
the
skipper
all
the
way
home
but
he
arrived
in
the
most
beatific
frame
of
mind
in
spite
of
it
the
relief
of
the
storm
of
temper
and
bad
language
had
been
so
great
to
him
that
he
was
filled
with
a
blessed
joy
he
said
it
was
the
most
invigorating
and
refreshing
pastime
he
ever
indulged
in
for
öla
could
not
understand
a
word
of
it
and
therefore
no
remorse
could
follow
the
outburst
not
a
thoughtless
expression
or
hasty
word
could
go
home
to
his
heart
and
there
rankle
to
recoil
on
some
future
occasion
but
the
whole
vial
of
wrath
could
be
emptied
on
its
object
without
fear
of
retribution
the
explosion
must
have
been
something
very
fine
to
enable
the
skipper
to
make
light
of
the
for
a
wind
on
gjendin
is
not
to
be
scoffed
at
in
any
boat
and
least
of
all
in
a
of
a
canoe
the
mountains
are
so
high
and
steep
that
the
lake
lies
as
it
were
in
a
trench
and
any
wind
always
draws
straight
up
or
down
the
length
and
soon
gets
a
big
sea
up
all
the
norwegians
we
have
seen
say
it
is
the
height
of
madness
to
go
on
gjendin
at
all
in
such
boats
the
sudden
squalls
are
so
dangerous
and
neither
of
our
men
can
be
persuaded
to
go
a
yard
in
them
esau
and
john
for
want
of
better
employment
after
fishing
a
little
began
to
bake
and
had
laid
out
a
goodly
show
of
dainty
confections
two
dozen
rolls
four
wimberry
tarts
a
lot
of
biscuits
and
a
venison
pie
of
the
ordinary
size
inches
diameter
when
the
skipper
returned
it
was
decided
to
make
another
as
we
imagine
the
meat
has
a
better
chance
of
keeping
when
hoarded
up
in
pies
than
when
left
in
its
raw
state
so
we
each
took
our
usual
share
in
the
construction
of
a
pie
before
which
all
other
pies
should
be
as
nought
it
was
made
in
our
largest
baking
tin
inches
across
and
contained
nearly
a
hind
quarter
of
venison
our
last
six
eggs
a
heart
a
liver
and
about
lb
of
bacon
the
crust
was
put
on
about
nine
o
clock
and
after
we
had
all
gazed
at
it
and
unanimously
agreed
that
it
was
the
boss
pie
we
bore
it
proudly
but
gingerly
to
the
oven
heated
by
john
seven
times
hotter
than
before
and
now
gaping
to
receive
it
a
great
full
moon
rose
up
from
behind
the
mountains
and
seemed
to
smile
on
our
good
work
the
bright
fire
shed
a
red
glow
over
the
three
figures
bending
o
er
the
simmering
treasure
and
a
more
peaceful
domestic
group
it
would
be
impossible
to
conceive
about
eleven
john
and
the
skipper
turned
in
but
outside
could
be
seen
for
some
time
the
solitary
form
of
esau
still
crouching
over
the
expiring
embers
of
the
oven
and
tending
with
a
mother
s
care
the
tempting
food
that
he
already
tasted
in
imagination
plate
baking
by
night
in
memurudalen
most
of
the
berries
of
the
country
are
now
just
at
their
best
and
memurudalen
is
a
grand
valley
for
all
of
them
except
of
course
the
strawberry
and
raspberry
which
will
not
grow
at
this
altitude
but
we
have
klarkling
the
english
crowberry
in
great
abundance
blau
bær
wimberry
the
finest
and
best
ever
seen
in
quantities
also
skin
tukt
another
blue
berry
rather
larger
than
a
wimberry
and
with
a
thicker
skin
and
wonderful
bloom
on
it
this
we
think
does
not
grow
in
england
then
less
numerous
are
a
berry
something
between
a
raspberry
and
a
red
currant
but
of
better
flavour
than
either
of
them
and
the
great
and
glorious
mölte
bær
cloudberry
to
say
nothing
of
heste
bær
and
tutti
bær
and
several
others
of
unknown
names
the
last
one
grows
in
england
but
we
have
forgotten
its
name
they
make
jelly
from
it
here
and
prize
it
highly
for
its
acid
taste
chapter
xxii
memurudalen
august
we
woke
up
this
morning
with
a
bright
sun
shining
through
the
canvas
of
the
tent
and
making
it
intolerably
hot
inside
and
as
we
threw
open
the
door
of
the
inner
compartment
the
fragrant
aroma
of
the
boss
pie
was
wafted
to
us
on
the
morning
air
we
spent
the
morning
in
quiet
sunday
fashion
chiefly
in
lying
under
the
shade
of
an
awning
made
with
rugs
which
we
call
the
sycamine
tree
and
eating
wimberries
and
cream
besides
this
we
perpetrated
a
great
deal
of
high
art
every
one
was
seized
with
the
desire
of
sketching
the
camp
and
so
we
sat
around
on
pinnacles
like
so
many
pelicans
libelling
the
unfortunate
place
from
every
position
whence
it
could
be
seen
it
is
looking
very
comfortable
just
now
the
tent
itself
is
pitched
in
an
angle
of
a
steep
little
cliff
which
effectually
protects
it
from
cold
winds
at
one
side
and
the
back
and
at
the
other
side
we
have
put
up
a
thick
fence
of
birch
branches
to
temper
the
storm
to
the
we
find
it
very
convenient
to
have
the
two
compartments
the
inner
one
is
only
used
for
sleeping
in
and
always
immediately
after
reveillé
is
plunged
in
an
apparently
hopeless
confusion
of
rugs
sheepskins
mattresses
and
boots
with
here
and
there
a
book
or
a
hat
protruding
to
use
the
skipper
s
beautiful
simile
like
brickbats
in
a
after
breakfast
all
the
bedding
is
dragged
out
to
be
aired
on
the
rocks
and
the
tent
generally
tidied
but
the
outer
tent
is
always
a
picture
of
order
and
neatness
for
here
we
keep
our
stores
boxes
of
flour
and
biscuits
cartridges
cooking
utensils
tools
whisky
and
potatoes
one
of
the
boxes
was
made
specially
under
esau
s
directions
to
be
used
as
a
table
the
top
and
bottom
are
both
hinged
and
so
when
the
box
is
put
on
its
front
and
these
two
lids
opened
it
makes
a
very
good
large
table
the
lids
are
held
up
by
a
batten
screwed
underneath
them
and
for
greater
security
we
have
added
two
legs
but
at
present
the
weather
is
so
pleasant
that
we
always
feed
outside
a
few
yards
from
the
tent
and
nearer
to
the
oven
on
the
extreme
left
as
the
penny
showman
says
you
will
observe
one
of
the
meat
safes
the
other
one
thou
canst
not
see
because
it
s
not
in
sight
being
close
to
the
back
of
the
tent
also
behind
the
tent
may
be
faintly
seen
the
mustard
and
cress
garden
always
covered
with
a
sheet
by
day
to
save
it
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
with
the
same
sheet
by
night
to
guard
it
from
the
cold
so
that
the
poor
thing
never
gets
any
light
and
does
not
flourish
very
exceedingly
none
of
the
mustard
seeds
have
as
yet
grown
up
as
big
as
the
one
in
the
parable
but
when
one
does
we
mean
to
make
a
lot
of
salad
out
of
it
enough
for
all
the
camp
above
the
middle
of
the
outer
tent
are
three
things
which
look
like
lightning
conductors
but
are
only
our
rods
which
are
always
stuck
in
the
ground
there
when
not
in
use
at
their
foot
under
the
rock
is
the
egg
larder
neatly
constructed
of
stones
and
turf
with
a
wooden
lid
and
hanging
from
the
cliff
hard
by
is
a
very
pretty
and
curious
spider
s
nest
made
of
paper
like
a
miniature
about
two
inches
in
diameter
high
up
in
the
centre
is
the
meteor
flag
of
england
engaged
in
its
customary
occupation
of
yet
terrific
burning
there
being
absolutely
no
dutch
boers
here
underneath
its
shelter
are
many
forked
poles
with
all
made
from
the
birch
with
which
the
valley
abounds
just
here
and
on
which
clothing
of
some
sort
is
always
hanging
out
to
dry
so
that
the
place
looks
like
a
and
deceives
even
the
ravens
which
come
down
in
swarms
from
the
mountains
in
search
of
maids
noses
to
devour
in
the
midst
of
these
poles
may
be
seen
the
oven
with
its
flue
reaching
halfway
up
the
hill
and
its
two
openings
the
lower
one
for
fuel
the
upper
for
food
plate
the
camp
in
memurudalen
right
in
front
of
the
tent
is
the
fireplace
a
long
trench
in
the
ground
faced
with
stones
of
such
a
size
and
shape
that
they
form
apertures
suitable
for
our
numerous
pans
and
simmering
by
the
fire
is
the
perennial
soup
nearer
to
the
front
is
the
wood
pile
and
nearer
still
the
board
on
which
the
cooking
things
are
placed
after
washing
up
in
front
again
of
this
is
the
little
stream
which
supplies
us
with
water
now
rapidly
beginning
to
fail
under
the
influence
of
the
long
drought
it
may
be
noticed
that
the
engineers
have
changed
its
course
in
several
places
for
greater
convenience
in
getting
water
and
to
give
more
room
on
the
camp
side
the
foreground
is
a
mass
of
juniper
wimberries
skintukt
crowberries
and
rocks
and
then
comes
about
thirty
yards
from
the
tent
the
memurua
torrent
all
thick
and
milky
from
the
glacier
cold
as
christmas
fishless
uninteresting
not
drinkable
only
useful
as
a
refrigerator
for
milk
and
only
agreeable
to
look
upon
from
a
distance
but
faithfully
keeping
up
the
unceasing
roar
that
is
customary
among
such
torrents
this
river
makes
the
waters
of
the
lake
too
cold
to
bathe
in
and
too
cheerless
for
fish
to
abide
in
near
our
camp
but
it
does
not
come
into
the
picture
partly
because
it
runs
in
a
ravine
but
more
because
it
was
right
behind
the
artist
the
lake
itself
is
to
the
extreme
right
with
unclimbable
rocky
mountains
forming
the
opposite
coast
we
dined
at
in
order
to
get
an
uninterrupted
evening
s
fishing
but
the
experiment
was
not
a
success
and
will
not
be
repeated
for
it
spoilt
the
dinner
and
we
caught
no
fish
on
returning
to
camp
at
night
rather
cold
very
cross
and
exceedingly
hungry
we
agreed
that
the
best
antidote
for
these
dangerous
symptoms
would
be
hot
soup
so
john
put
the
pot
on
the
fire
while
the
skipper
and
esau
were
attending
to
the
tent
and
domestic
duties
soon
the
caldron
was
heated
and
brought
into
the
tent
and
the
eager
crowd
drew
near
with
cups
and
spoons
and
one
lifted
the
lid
while
another
plunged
his
cup
into
the
steaming
savoury
mess
and
then
arose
a
great
cry
of
horror
and
desolation
and
the
sleeping
valley
rang
with
the
wail
of
men
in
despair
for
john
had
put
the
wrong
pot
on
the
fire
and
we
had
been
presented
with
boiling
dirty
water
in
which
the
had
been
washed
up
while
all
the
time
the
soup
pot
was
quiet
untouched
and
cold
in
the
corner
of
the
tent
where
it
is
kept
but
three
hungry
men
are
not
to
be
balked
of
a
meal
on
which
their
hearts
are
set
by
any
trifle
like
this
so
we
all
commenced
with
a
will
to
stoke
that
fire
up
and
put
that
other
pot
on
and
we
got
our
soup
and
were
snugly
packed
in
bed
long
before
the
gentle
august
moon
had
sunk
to
rest
behind
the
sheltering
mountain
tops
the
skipper
by
the
way
is
very
much
exasperated
with
this
same
moon
just
now
he
says
she
is
a
fraud
for
this
morning
when
we
got
up
there
she
was
high
in
the
heavens
what
right
he
wants
to
know
has
this
moon
any
moon
in
fact
to
be
up
there
blinking
away
in
the
middle
of
the
day
when
we
have
plenty
of
sun
to
light
us
forward
dissipated
thing
and
then
probably
after
this
week
we
shall
have
ever
so
many
nights
without
any
moon
at
all
and
all
the
earth
left
in
total
darkness
to
take
care
of
itself
while
here
we
are
with
an
absurdly
round
moon
at
one
end
of
this
comparatively
diminutive
valley
and
a
most
extravagantly
blazing
sun
at
the
the
whole
thing
is
ridiculous
he
says
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
there
is
some
justice
in
his
complaint
though
no
doubt
there
could
be
a
good
deal
said
on
the
other
side
while
esau
went
out
after
deer
the
other
two
crawled
up
the
mountain
and
over
to
rus
vand
to
fish
and
had
a
good
day
two
of
the
skipper
s
fish
were
three
pounds
each
but
like
most
of
the
biggest
fish
not
in
that
beautiful
condition
which
the
smaller
ones
always
show
the
skipper
is
sure
that
the
old
fish
creep
up
to
the
stony
shallows
at
the
western
end
of
the
lake
to
die
in
a
sunny
spot
just
as
we
men
creep
away
in
our
old
age
to
bath
cheltenham
cannes
or
algiers
to
breathe
our
last
in
a
warm
place
thereby
taking
one
step
in
the
direction
of
the
proverbial
future
esau
arrived
in
camp
about
seven
quite
exhausted
and
followed
by
öla
also
dead
beat
and
again
bearing
the
heads
and
skins
of
two
deer
a
buck
and
a
doe
he
was
hailed
with
fervent
joy
and
many
congratulations
it
is
certainly
great
luck
to
fall
in
with
deer
on
two
stalking
days
in
succession
for
they
are
by
no
means
numerous
here
this
year
dinner
was
served
in
a
marvellously
short
time
august
truite

the

could
not
eat
any
then
came
esau
s
romance
we
walked
up
the
memurua
to
the
great
glacier
and
then
skirted
its
south
side
we
found
many
fresh
tracks
and
about
two
o
clock
when
we
were
seven
miles
from
home
öla
spied
three
deer
chewing
stones
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
away
the
wind
was
just
in
the
right
direction
to
allow
us
to
approach
them
and
they
were
in
capital
ground
for
stalking
full
of
little
hollows
and
slopes
but
there
was
a
serious
drawback
on
one
side
was
a
lake
on
the
other
an
impassable
precipice
and
before
we
could
get
into
a
place
out
of
their
sight
we
should
be
obliged
to
cross
a
narrow
strip
of
ground
in
full
view
of
them
though
perhaps
half
a
mile
from
them
we
sat
down
and
had
our
lunch
and
waited
an
hour
watching
for
them
to
lie
down
and
at
last
they
did
so
then
we
determined
to
risk
the
passage
of
the
dangerous
strip
and
by
crawling
like
serpents
and
aided
by
luck
got
across
without
the
deer
seeing
us
then
we
had
to
creep
along
the
side
of
a
scandalous
precipice
for
the
next
in
no
danger
of
being
seen
but
with
our
hearts
constantly
in
our
mouths
as
despite
our
care
some
stone
was
dislodged
and
went
clattering
down
the
rocks
sounding
to
my
strained
ears
as
if
it
must
disturb
every
living
thing
within
a
mile
very
slow
and
difficult
was
our
progress
occasionally
dangerous
but
at
last
we
arrived
at
a
spot
yards
from
the
deer
which
were
still
lying
down
and
pronounced
by
öla
to
be
a
buck
and
two
does
this
was
a
very
awkward
place
to
shoot
from
and
i
thought
i
could
see
my
way
to
a
better
one
much
nearer
so
tried
it
and
found
it
was
just
possible
and
after
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
worming
i
arrived
at
a
place
only
yards
from
them
from
this
i
could
see
both
the
does
well
but
only
the
head
of
the
buck
and
so
had
to
lie
there
an
hour
waiting
for
him
to
get
up
both
the
does
did
so
twice
offering
beautiful
shots
but
he
would
not
move
and
they
lay
down
again
i
dare
not
whistle
to
make
him
jump
up
for
fear
the
does
might
possibly
be
in
the
way
at
the
moment
so
there
i
lay
miserably
uncomfortable
with
cramp
in
every
muscle
and
at
last
i
tried
to
crawl
to
another
stone
about
five
yards
away
from
which
i
thought
i
could
see
to
shoot
at
the
buck
when
i
got
to
it
and
peered
cautiously
over
i
was
horrified
to
see
the
deer
some
distance
away
and
running
as
hard
as
they
could
towards
a
small
glacier
which
was
close
to
them
illustration
esau
stalking
near
hinaakjærnhullet
of
course
i
instantly
lost
my
head
and
jumping
up
fired
at
the
buck
without
much
aim
and
missed
him
then
i
recovered
my
senses
and
made
a
careful
shot
at
the
last
doe
knocking
her
over
like
a
rabbit
the
other
two
were
just
then
out
of
sight
in
a
hollow
but
they
appeared
directly
going
up
the
hill
on
the
snow
at
a
great
speed
and
getting
a
broadside
shot
at
the
buck
i
broke
his
shoulder
after
this
he
went
slowly
but
still
kept
on
up
the
hill
and
when
he
was
about
three
hundred
yards
away
i
fired
two
more
shots
one
of
which
hit
him
in
the
ribs
and
the
other
cut
one
of
his
horns
off
then
he
gave
up
trying
to
mount
the
hill
and
turned
down
towards
the
lake
out
of
my
sight
i
ran
as
hard
as
i
could
across
the
shoulder
of
the
glacier
and
saw
him
standing
down
below
me
among
the
rocks
close
to
the
water
and
sitting
down
i
fired
another
shot
which
killed
him
this
is
not
a
creditable
performance
in
the
shooting
line
but
my
solid
bullets
have
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
matter
either
of
the
first
two
shots
would
have
stopped
him
at
once
if
fired
from
an
express
with
bullets
the
doe
is
a
barren
one
with
a
beautiful
skin
and
very
fat
and
the
buck
is
the
best
we
have
killed
at
present
this
year
a
what
öla
calls
a
litt
stor
bock
little
big
buck
which
i
suppose
is
the
next
best
thing
to
the
mythical
meget
stor
bock
whose
footprints
we
are
always
seeing
but
who
carefully
absenteth
himself
whensoever
the
jovial
hunter
goeth
forth
to
pursue
him
we
saw
a
great
deal
of
fresh
spoor
so
that
we
may
hope
the
deer
are
beginning
to
come
to
our
part
of
the
country
perhaps
the
poor
things
have
been
very
much
bullied
in
other
places
anyhow
they
won
t
find
any
better
country
in
norway
than
where
we
went
and
the
scenery
there
is
esau
was
so
tired
that
he
fell
asleep
once
in
the
midst
of
his
exciting
narrative
and
as
dinner
was
very
late
we
all
turned
in
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
finished
chapter
xxiii
a
picnic
there
is
a
brood
of
ryper
on
the
brow
of
the
mountain
above
our
camp
which
we
always
put
up
when
we
walk
over
glopit
armed
with
rods
but
never
when
we
take
a
gun
there
were
originally
eight
of
them
but
one
has
succumbed
to
a
merlin
which
hunts
up
there
and
they
are
remarkably
tame
so
that
when
we
put
them
up
we
throw
stones
at
them
and
fully
expect
to
kill
them
by
that
means
but
somehow
they
have
escaped
with
their
lives
until
now
this
conduct
has
become
unbearable
and
we
have
sworn
this
day
that
brood
shall
die
so
the
first
thing
after
breakfast
esau
and
the
skipper
toiled
up
the
mountain
with
pockets
full
of
cartridges
and
guns
ready
for
the
slaughter
of
the
innocents
it
takes
just
three
quarters
of
an
hour
to
get
to
the
top
and
after
reaching
it
we
tramped
over
some
millions
of
acres
in
search
of
that
brood
and
of
course
it
never
obtruded
itself
on
the
scene
finally
the
skipper
went
home
in
disgust
remarking
that
he
wished
every
ryper
in
norway
was
at
the
bottom
of
gjendin
while
esau
said
he
would
stay
up
there
a
month
or
two
and
find
those
birds
if
they
were
anywhere
on
our
sheet
of
the
ordnance
the
skipper
had
hardly
walked
yards
towards
camp
before
he
trod
on
the
old
cock
who
got
up
observing
kek
kek
kurrack
kurrack
krackrackackckkkkk
in
an
extremely
indignant
tone
of
voice
and
the
rest
of
the
family
immediately
followed
him
astonishing
the
skipper
so
much
that
he
missed
the
lot
and
though
we
marked
them
down
quite
near
we
could
not
persuade
any
of
them
to
risk
their
lives
in
flight
again
the
language
used
on
this
occasion
scorched
the
herbage
off
so
large
a
patch
of
ground
that
john
down
below
thought
that
glopit
had
suddenly
commenced
a
volcanic
eruption
there
are
two
kinds
of
birds
known
as
ryper
in
norway
the
fjeld
or
skarv
ryper
which
is
we
think
identical
with
our
ptarmigan
and
the
dal
or
skog
ryper
which
we
believe
to
be
the
same
bird
as
the
willow
grouse
of
north
america
the
former
of
these
is
not
numerous
anywhere
but
a
few
are
always
seen
by
the
reindeer
hunter
up
on
the
highest
parts
of
the
mountains
among
the
snow
and
rocks
they
do
not
attempt
much
concealment
but
their
grey
bodies
and
white
wings
are
so
exactly
the
colour
of
their
habitation
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
them
as
they
sit
perfectly
still
on
the
stones
if
you
do
happen
to
catch
sight
of
one
in
all
probability
after
looking
at
him
for
a
little
you
will
suddenly
be
aware
that
there
is
a
small
family
of
others
all
about
him
and
will
wonder
how
they
escaped
your
notice
at
first
they
are
not
very
useful
for
sporting
purposes
as
they
are
never
found
in
great
numbers
are
too
tame
to
give
any
trouble
and
not
particularly
good
to
eat
the
skog
ryper
is
the
bird
which
takes
the
place
of
the
british
grouse
for
the
sportsman
in
norway
he
lives
at
a
lower
altitude
than
the
skarv
ryper
among
the
willows
wimberries
and
stunted
birches
in
plumage
he
is
not
unlike
our
grouse
but
not
quite
so
red
in
shade
and
with
a
white
wing
during
the
summer
he
feeds
on
wimberry
leaves
heather
and
occasional
bits
of
willow
and
he
is
then
almost
if
not
quite
equal
to
a
grouse
in
flavour
but
in
winter
when
there
is
nothing
but
willow
to
be
had
the
flesh
becomes
bitter
and
not
nice
to
eat
the
poor
birds
are
then
snared
in
great
numbers
and
may
be
seen
hanging
in
english
shops
as
ptarmigan
which
with
their
then
white
plumage
they
much
resemble
after
a
good
breeding
season
these
skog
ryper
are
very
numerous
in
any
favourable
place
in
norway
but
they
are
so
much
inclined
to
lie
close
that
without
dogs
it
is
impossible
to
do
much
with
them
gjendin
is
too
steep
and
desolate
for
them
but
between
the
east
end
of
the
lake
and
sjödals
vand
there
is
some
country
and
also
a
little
at
the
west
end
after
lunch
we
all
manned
esau
s
canoe
which
is
the
largest
because
he
is
the
smallest
man
and
set
off
down
the
lake
to
leirungsö
the
place
where
the
professor
s
hut
is
built
at
the
edge
of
the
waterfall
which
runs
out
of
a
small
lake
there
not
the
real
leirung
s
vand
which
is
further
to
the
east
the
skipper
had
noticed
a
remarkably
fine
bed
of
mölte
bær
there
which
we
expected
to
be
just
about
ripe
now
and
so
we
had
determined
to
picnic
there
forsooth
as
if
our
life
were
not
one
perpetual
and
perennial
picnic
leirungsö
is
nearly
four
miles
from
our
camp
and
the
professor
s
hut
is
an
extremely
comfortable
and
convenient
little
dwelling
in
a
most
charming
situation
only
one
thing
has
been
wanting
reindeer
he
never
found
any
and
left
his
hut
a
fortnight
ago
for
a
place
further
north
where
we
afterwards
heard
he
had
good
sport
after
landing
the
skipper
and
esau
climbed
up
the
valley
to
the
little
lake
in
search
of
something
to
shoot
while
john
remained
to
bathe
and
fish
at
the
fall
there
were
lots
of
duck
on
the
little
lake
and
in
the
rushy
swamp
at
its
upper
end
and
the
skipper
put
up
a
large
brood
of
ryper
which
we
marked
into
a
very
small
patch
of
willow
scrub
surrounded
by
bare
ground
we
walked
through
and
through
that
patch
and
threw
so
many
stones
into
it
that
we
fancy
we
must
have
killed
and
buried
most
of
them
for
we
only
persuaded
four
of
them
to
fly
again
three
of
which
we
secured
our
shooting
was
soon
over
and
then
we
gathered
a
lot
of
mölte
bær
and
returned
to
john
who
was
getting
dinner
ready
and
after
a
regal
repast
of
kidneys
reindeer
pie
and
mölte
paddled
home
by
moonlight
arriving
soon
after
nine
we
beguiled
the
journey
home
by
songs
and
accompaniments
by
the
following
celebrated
artists

immediately
discovered
that

was
the
most

possessed

thing
he
cared
about
in

so
he
undressed
and
dived
for

for

at

to
recover
it
it
would

with

and
it
was
good
to
see
his
proud
bearing
as
he
returned
to

with
the
tolle

slung
jauntily
at
his
waist
and
carrying
over
his

the
scaly

we
dined
and
then
sat
round
the
fire
wondering
what
could
have
happened
to
delay
him
and
as
time
went
on
and
still
he
never
came
we
began
to
get
very
uneasy
there
are
so
many
dangers
by
which
the
reindeer
hunter
may
be
overtaken
avalanches
crevasses
fogs
snowdrifts
broken
limbs
or
getting
lost
we
could
only
hope
that
none
of
these
had
happened
to
the
skipper
and
at
eleven
o
clock
gave
up
any
hopes
of
his
return
that
night
and
turned
in
there

then
a
very
decided

the
skipper
s
return
at
the
drover
who
had
accompanied
us
to
shoot
ryper
at
gjendebod
arrived
here
on
his
way
towards
lower
and
more
genial
regions
for
the
winter
we
always
feel
that
we
are
killing
more
game
than
we
really
need
and
here
was
an
outlet
for
our
superfluous
meat
so
we
gave
him
half
a
deer
and
he
went
homewards
rejoicing
greatly
we
had
sent
ivar
up
to
the
drover
s
den
in
memurudalen
at
daybreak
to
see
if
our
missing
ones
had
found
their
way
to
it
and
spent
the
night
there
but
he
now
came
back
without
having
found
any
traces
of
them
however
under
the
cheering
influence
of
the
morning
sun
we
soon
became
resigned
to
their
fate
and
esau
so
far
regained
his
spirits
that
he
crossed
the
glacier
torrent
with
a
gun
and
penetrated
the
birchwood
on
the
other
side
to
what
he
called
shoot
the
home
he
presently
brought
back
a
woodcock
which
had
got
up
about
fourteen
times
before
he
killed
it
and
each
time
he
had
thought
it
was
a
fresh
cock
so
that
he
had
had
a
regular
sporting
morning
after
it
seeing
lots
of
cock
get
up
shooting
at
two
and
killing
one
of
them
the
wood
being
so
thick
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
get
even
the
snappiest
of
at
the
agile
bird
esau
then
busied
himself
with
the
construction
of
a
rack
to
hold
all
our
guns
and
spare
rods
cleaning
rod
with
a
shelf
near
the
bottom
for
books
and
another
one
whereon
each
man
might
keep
his
little
valuables
such
as
pipes
and
watch
and
reels
this
contrivance
was
chiefly
formed
of
birch
boughs
of
peculiar
shape
and
when
finished
and
placed
in
its
proper
position
at
the
further
end
of
the
tent
just
behind
our
pillows
it
presented
a
truly
noble
appearance
passed
and
still
the
skipper
had
not
returned
so
we
decided
that
he
must
be
defunct
and
proceeded
to
write
his
epitaph
preparatory
to
organising
a
search
expedition
to
bring
in
his
remains
here
is
one
touching
little
poem
he
was
rather
tall
and
terribly
thin
but
remarkably
roomy
inside
we
put
up
these
stones
to
cover
his
bones
near
the
place
where
we
think
he
died
this
is
another
in
memuruhameren

round
the
camp
our
skipper
has
gone
our
great
head
cook
on
a

that

find
in

he
s
surely
taken
his
hook
nor
left
any
trace
behind
with
a
rod
or
pole
he
would
fish
for
perch
now
a
rod
pole
or
perch
of
ground
is
more
than
he
needs
and
in
vain
we
search
for
his
body
will
ne
er
be
found
now
his
angling
is
finished
though
once
every
fin
which
came
within
reach
he
d
attack
he
was
really
so
clever
at
reeling
them
in
and
his
terms
were
to
fish
nett
on
a
lake
or
pond
or
even
a
moat
he
beamed
wherever
he
went
how
cheerfully
he
would
tar
his
boat
how
gaily
would
pitch
his
tent
after
ryper
or
deer
he
would
walk
all
day
from
the
top
of
a
hill
to
the
bottom
and
we
feel
it
unpleasantly
sad
to
say
that
the
dear
old
reaper
s
got
him
but
we
think
it
is
time
that
this
verse
were
done
which
to
mournfully
write
we
ve
tried
in
memory
o
our
darlin
one
who
in
memurudalen
died
while
we
were
still
lingering
over
these
beautiful
and
appropriate
sentiments
and
deliberating
as
to
whether
they
should
be
cut
on
a
stone
or
only
on
wood
the
corpse
suddenly
walked
into
the
tent
and
announced
that
he
wanted
something
to
eat
we
soon
got
over
our
natural
disappointment
at
the
waste
of
a
good
epitaph
and
really
welcomed
him
quite
warmly
much
more
so
when
öla
appeared
laden
with
the
of
a
reindeer
buck
then
we
set
food
before
the
skipper
and
after
he
had
feasted
he
related
unto
us
his
story
i
left
camp
yesterday
morning
determined
to
beard
the
savage
untamed
reindeer
of
the
mountains
in
his
lair
and
soon
came
on
very
fresh
tracks
which
we
followed
for
some
time
and
at
each
step
seemed
to
get
hotter
as
the
children
say
and
the
indications
of
deer
being
near
got
more
and
more
encouraging
however
by
one
o
clock
we
had
seen
nothing
so
sat
down
behind
a
little
rocky
eminence
to
have
our
mine
was
a
particularly
good
lunch
as
i
had
spread
some
gravy
from
the
boss
pie
on
my
slice
of
bread
and
butter
and
this
with
the
icy
cold
was
very
grateful
after
a
four
hours
walk
uphill
under
a
scorching
sun
illustration
the
skipper
about
to
astonish
the
reindeer
öla
also
seemed
to
devour
his
food
with
considerable
relish
so
we
had
been
sitting
there
some
time
happily
silent
as
we
can
not
talk
each
other
s
tongue
and
i
was
just
preparing
to
move
on
and
putting
my
knife
back
in
its
sheath
when
we
heard
a
slight
snort
quite
close
to
us
öla
immediately
peeped
cautiously
over
an
adjacent
stone
then
he
pushed
my
rifle
into
my
hand
and
whispering
the
magic
word
reins
pointed
to
another
stone
a
few
yards
away
whither
he
wished
me
to
crawl
to
unsling
my
lest
it
should
jingle
and
creep
to
that
stone
was
what
the
novelists
call
the
work
of
a
moment
then
i
raised
my
head
gingerly
and
saw
forty
yards
away
a
single
buck
standing
broadside
to
me
with
his
head
in
the
air
sniffing
suspiciously
and
his
whole
attitude
denoting
uncertainty
and
caution
this
buck
as
we
found
out
afterwards
from
the
spoor
had
walked
up
to
within
ten
yards
of
us
as
we
sat
at
lunch
then
he
must
have
either
heard
me
or
smelt
öla
probably
the
latter
for
öla
seldom
washes
his
hands
never
his
hunting
coat
and
when
i
encountered
his
gaze
he
had
evidently
just
decided
that
this
was
not
a
good
place
for
reindeer
to
be
about
in
this
was
an
excellent
frame
of
mind
on
his
part
but
he
arrived
at
it
a
couple
of
seconds
too
late
my
rifle
was
levelled
and
the
shot
hit
him
just
above
the
heart
at
that
distance
the
express
bullet
smashed
a
portion
of
him
about
as
big
as
a
hat
so
that
he
rolled
over
stone
dead
and
had
no
time
for
lingering
glances
or
last
words
half
an
hour
more
and
he
was
skinned
gralloched
put
in
a
hole
and
buried
under
a
heap
of
stones
to
remain
there
until
we
need
his
flesh
and
send
the
horse
to
bring
him
home
then
we
built
a
little
cairn
to
mark
his
for
future
use
and
wandered
on
in
search
of
the
rest
of
his
party
very
soon
we
came
on
the
tracks
of
four
other
deer
one
of
them
only
a
calf
but
although
we
followed
the
spoor
all
the
afternoon
we
never
came
up
with
them
probably
they
were
near
enough
to
hear
my
shot
when
i
fired
and
at
once
betook
themselves
to
remote
regions
illustration
öla
performing
the
funeral
rites
it
had
got
so
late
before
we
gave
up
the
search
and
we
were
such
a
long
way
from
home
that
we
determined
to
go
to
gjendebod
at
the
western
end
of
the
lake
hoping
to
get
a
boat
there
and
return
to
memurudalen
by
water
but
on
arriving
there
very
tired
hot
and
hungry
we
found
that
the
men
had
taken
their
boat
down
the
lake
and
would
not
return
until
this
was
a
great
blow
for
it
is
quite
impossible
to
walk
along
the
shores
of
gjendin
except
as
john
says
for
a
bird
and
even
it
would
have
to
fly
all
the
way
climbing
up
the
mountain
again
was
out
of
the
question
as
it
is
a
seven
hours
walk
from
gjendebod
to
our
camp
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
sleeping
there
a
course
which
was
very
distasteful
to
me
as
the
food
is
bad
and
i
had
no
book
with
me
no
tobacco
no
and
no
i
started
for
home
directly
after
breakfast
we
wished
to
combine
a
little
stalking
with
the
walk
for
we
had
to
pass
through
some
deer
country
all
that
part
esau
where
you
got
your
first
two
bucks
but
of
course
we
had
not
much
chance
of
doing
anything
as
the
wind
was
with
us
all
the
way
as
you
know
deer
almost
always
feed
up
wind
so
by
walking
against
it
you
are
safe
from
their
ears
and
noses
and
also
are
likely
to
be
warned
of
their
presence
by
coming
on
their
tracks
first
but
in
walking
down
wind
all
this
is
reversed
you
come
upon
the
deer
without
any
warning
and
they
are
almost
sure
to
smell
or
hear
you
long
before
you
discover
them
consequently
as
we
expected
we
saw
nothing
on
our
way
here
the
skipper
s
buck
is
a
very
good
one
the
best
that
has
been
killed
at
present
and
there
was
much
joy
at
his
change
of
luck
but
strictly
speaking
his
bad
luck
has
pursued
him
even
in
this
instance
for
if
he
had
not
been
obliged
to
shoot
when
he
did
in
all
probability
the
rest
of
the
herd
would
have
appeared
on
the
scene
for
their
tracks
showed
that
they
were
following
the
lead
of
this
buck
besides
there
is
not
the
same
excitement
in
a
chance
shot
like
this
as
there
is
when
you
first
find
the
deer
and
then
spend
two
or
three
hours
in
all
kinds
of
uncomfortable
modes
of
progression
in
order
to
approach
them
however
when
we
were
in
this
country
before
the
skipper
had
all
the
good
luck
and
esau
the
bad
the
former
getting
five
deer
and
the
latter
only
two
so
that
the
present
state
of
affairs
may
be
looked
upon
as
the
working
of
retributive
justice
when
this
view
of
the
matter
was
suggested
by
esau
to
the
skipper
he
said
retributive
justice
be
blowed
we
celebrated
the
joyful
reunion
of
loving
hearts
by
a
skaal
and
so
to
bed
perfectly
happy
after
the
events
of
the
day
we
sent
the
men
off
this
morning
with
the
horse
to
bring
in
some
of
the
meat
now
lying
in
the
mountains
while
we
went
by
canoe
to
gjendesheim
to
stay
for
a
couple
of
days
as
we
can
not
go
stalking
again
till
the
already
slain
deer
are
brought
home
the
fish
in
the
lake
are
not
rising
well
after
this
long
spell
of
fine
weather
and
with
the
exception
of
esau
s
home
coverts
there
is
no
shooting
for
a
at
memurudalen
very
few
tourists
find
their
way
to
gjendin
but
the
season
for
them
is
over
and
we
expected
to
have
the
place
to
ourselves
but
how
fallible
is
human
prescience
to
our
astonishment
the
sportsmen
from
rus
vand
had
already
occupied
the
greater
part
of
the
house
having
abandoned
their
own
hut
for
the
same
reasons
which
had
led
us
to
forsake
our
camp
and
here
they
were
armed
to
the
teeth
with
rods
and
guns
this
seemed
unlucky
and
although
we
were
outwardly
glad
to
see
them
at
heart
we
could
not
help
feeling
how
inconsiderate
it
was
of
them
to
come
and
shoot
the
fjeld
and
fish
the
river
just
when
we
wanted
to
do
all
that
ourselves
no
doubt
they
harboured
precisely
the
same
feelings
towards
us
however
we
had
dinner
together
and
introduced
the
boss
pie
now
rapidly
disappearing
to
the
notice
of
our
norwegian
friends
and
as
the
meal
advanced
a
feeling
of
genial
contentment
crept
over
us
which
seemed
to
influence
all
our
senses
we
began
to
talk
over
sport
and
compare
our
experiences
in
various
countries
and
in
pursuit
of
various
animals
some
of
us
were
good
listeners
others
fond
of
talking
but
all
animated
by
a
love
for
the
same
occupation
so
that
when
at
length
one
of
the
enemy
handed
round
the
best
of
cigars
even
the
skipper
became
so
mellow
and
pleasant
that
before
going
to
bed
we
arranged
for
a
joint
shoot
after
ryper
and
said
good
night
feeling
that
it
was
quite
fortunate
that
we
had
all
come
to
gjendesheim
on
the
same
day
one
of
our
new
friends
is
a
russian
an
engineer
officer
he
speaks
not
the
english
but
we
were
introduced
to
him
as
a
man
who
had
shot
more
bears
in
europe
than
any
one
else
living
he
has
killed
and
looks
as
though
he
had
been
hugged
by
each
one
of
them
before
it
finally
succumbed
now
he
wants
to
kill
a
reindeer
and
has
been
attempting
the
feat
apparently
he
will
be
de
for
the
rest
of
the
week
as
he
can
hardly
move
for
stiffness
he
has
not
been
accustomed
to
the
awful
walking
that
stalking
round
gjendin
entails
esau
is
also
rather
dilapidated
for
he
landed
at
leirungsö
on
his
way
down
the
lake
and
walked
round
the
mountain
to
gjendesheim
leaving
john
to
bring
on
his
canoe
on
his
way
he
was
obliged
to
wade
across
the
leirungs
river
a
wide
and
rapid
stream
and
just
in
the
roughest
part
he
trod
on
a
loose
stone
and
fell
cutting
his
knee
and
making
a
bad
dent
in
his
of
course
he
was
wet
through
and
a
good
deal
hurt
but
hardly
enough
to
account
for
the
frightful
state
of
his
temper
till
it
came
out
that
though
he
had
walked
through
miles
of
beautiful
ground
for
ryper
snipe
and
duck
he
had
never
got
a
shot
at
anything
chapter
xxv
the
gjende
fly
this
was
the
hottest
most
windless
and
cloudless
day
that
has
yet
been
made
the
russian
and
f
went
out
with
esau
and
the
skipper
to
shoot
ryper
accompanied
by
a
pointer
which
the
norwegians
call
a
a
brood
was
soon
found
and
rose
in
front
of
esau
who
with
his
usual
promptitude
got
a
right
and
left
whereupon
the
russian
took
off
his
hat
and
bowing
profoundly
advanced
and
solemnly
shook
hands
with
him
protesting
that
he
had
frequently
seen
marvellous
shooting
but
never
never
aught
like
this
at
least
that
is
what
we
imagined
to
be
the
translation
of
the
neat
little
speech
which
he
made
in
russian
a
ryper
is
easier
to
kill
if
possible
than
the
tamest
young
grouse
which
gets
up
under
a
dog
s
nose
on
the
calmest
of
august
and
esau
thinks
fame
is
like
an
eel
on
a
easily
caught
but
very
difficult
to
hold
afterwards
satisfied
by
having
witnessed
this
extraordinary
specimen
of
our
skill
the
russian
gave
up
the
chase
and
returned
to
gjendesheim
completely
exhausted
by
the
heat
but
the
others
went
on
till
the
afternoon
now
finding
a
selfish
old
cock
whose
fate
no
one
regretted
now
a
young
brood
only
just
old
enough
to
be
shot
anon
lying
down
to
rest
and
eat
berries
or
bathing
in
the
leirungs
lake
but
all
the
time
extremely
happy
f
was
so
exceedingly
polite
that
he
would
shoot
unless
birds
enough
for
all
of
us
happened
to
get
up
at
once
and
one
brood
escaped
without
a
shot
being
fired
in
consequence
of
our
unwonted
emulation
of
his
courtesy
near
leirungs
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
drive
three
large
broods
into
the
same
bit
of
willow
scrub
and
had
some
very
pretty
shooting
as
the
dog
set
them
one
by
one
but
there
was
hardly
any
scent
and
the
heat
soon
proved
too
much
for
our
so
we
returned
to
gjendesheim
with
a
very
considerable
addition
to
the
larder
then
followed
hours
of
inability
to
do
anything
except
lie
on
our
backs
with
lighted
pipes
in
our
mouths
far
too
exhausted
to
smoke
them
and
at
last
dinner
and
soon
the
cooler
air
brought
relief
and
engendered
a
return
of
bloodthirstiness
which
impelled
the
gang
of
sportsmen
to
sally
forth
and
rake
the
river
till
it
was
quite
rough
with
artificial
flies
this
was
a
trying
time
for
by
some
means
we
have
established
a
most
dangerously
flattering
reputation
as
fishermen
and
were
bound
to
do
all
we
knew
to
retain
it
however
all
turned
out
right
the
skipper
went
into
the
lake
and
got
several
beauties
and
esau
did
the
same
in
the
river
so
that
we
came
in
with
the
best
bags
by
a
considerable
margin
and
could
now
afford
to
catch
nothing
for
a
whole
day
without
being
dethroned
from
our
pedestal
the
river
gjendinoset
as
it
is
called
just
in
front
of
the
is
a
wonderful
piece
of
water
there
are
about
yards
of
rapid
in
which
the
fish
lie
then
comes
a
fall
and
below
that
there
are
nothing
at
present
but
small
fish
though
the
big
ones
will
soon
begin
to
drop
down
lower
for
spawning
consequently
we
all
fish
in
the
first
yards
and
between
and
lbs
weight
has
been
taken
out
the
same
quantity
yesterday
and
probably
for
some
days
before
and
the
fishing
will
be
even
better
a
few
days
later
for
the
gjende
fly
is
beginning
to
hatch
and
as
long
as
he
lasts
the
fish
will
rise
well
we
have
heard
so
much
of
this
fly
that
we
had
been
expecting
something
rather
gorgeous
a
monster
or
at
least
a
butterfly
or
a
decent
imitation
of
a
and
we
have
been
looking
up
gaudy
scotch
and
canadian
salmon
flies
which
we
hoped
might
be
passable
substitutes
but
alas
for
the
vain
hopes
of
foolish
man
the
gjende
fly
has
come
and
he
is
only
a
wretched
little
black
beast
like
a
very
small
unenterprising
common
or
garden
of
great
britain
he
can
not
fly
decently
he
is
apparently
devoid
of
sense
he
has
no
moral
physical
or
intellectual
attributes
for
which
a
human
being
can
learn
to
respect
or
love
him
but
he
crawl
if
he
alights
on
the
water
it
never
occurs
to
him
to
rise
again
and
he
allows
the
trout
mad
with
the
excitement
of
a
fortnight
s
prospective
gluttony
to
scoop
him
down
their
capacious
throats
by
companies
if
he
enters
your
mouth
which
he
does
with
a
numerous
retinue
every
time
you
open
it
retreat
from
that
untenable
position
is
the
very
last
thing
he
would
think
of
and
with
what
may
be
a
gleam
of
momentary
intelligence
he
seems
desirous
of
still
further
increasing
his
knowledge
of
the
rest
of
your
interior
arrangements
with
characteristic
obstinacy
unmindful
of
the
teachings
of
logic
he
invariably
acts
on
the
fallacious
maxim
that
an
can
not
be
so
full
that
there
is
not
room
for
just
one
more
gjende
the
whole
of
the
river
here
at
the
end
of
the
lake
and
for
thirty
yards
on
each
side
is
now
pervaded
by
this
noisome
creature
the
water
looks
as
if
it
were
covered
with
a
mixture
of
soot
and
tar
the
rocks
are
black
and
slippery
with
him
and
the
atmosphere
is
charged
with
him
so
that
the
landscape
dimly
seen
through
the
cloud
looks
as
if
it
were
dancing
gjendesheim
itself
is
unfortunately
not
quite
beyond
the
zone
which
he
infests
so
that
the
windows
look
loathsome
with
crawling
blackness
the
tablecloth
is
strewn
with
the
corpses
of
those
who
have
imbibed
the
honeyed
poison
of
the
paraffin
lamp
and
come
to
an
untimely
end
and
the
remains
of
the
boss
pie
would
warrant
a
stranger
in
the
belief
that
it
had
been
composed
of
currants
we
think
pharaoh
must
have
been
a
man
of
extraordinary
resolution
or
else
inane
mildness
of
character
otherwise
he
would
have
sacrificed
moses
long
before
the
fourth
plague
was
concluded
fortunately
the
gjende
fly
has
no
insatiable
craving
for
human
flesh
the
skipper
indeed
asserted
that
one
fastened
on
his
hand
and
inflicted
a
wound
that
swelled
enormously
and
remained
swollen
for
several
days
but
the
better
opinion
is
that
the
creature
that
perpetrated
this
outrage
must
have
been
a
viper
though
we
did
not
hint
this
to
the
skipper
because
he
is
firmly
convinced
that
whisky
is
the
only
remedy
for
and
that
it
must
be
taken
in
large
quantities
if
any
one
stuck
up
a
rod
near
the
river
in
two
minutes
it
looked
like
a
black
fir
pole
with
a
bunch
on
the
top
and
john
who
is
a
man
of
great
entomological
knowledge
spent
some
time
in
studying
this
phenomenon
he
reported
that
the
flies
crawled
up
for
fun
intending
to
jump
off
the
top
ring
but
when
they
got
up
it
was
so
much
higher
than
they
expected
that
they
were
all
afraid
to
try
and
those
at
the
bottom
and
halfway
up
kept
jeering
at
the
top
ones
and
calling
them
names
and
jostling
them
so
much
that
they
could
not
crawl
down
again
he
also
said
that
the
swarm
in
the
air
was
so
dense
that
he
wrote
his
name
in
it
with
his
finger
and
it
remained
visible
for
nearly
a
minute
probably
it
is
difficult
for
a
man
to
speak
the
exact
truth
with
his
mouth
full
of
lies
when
it
was
too
dark
to
fish
we
sat
round
the
fire
and
heard
a
good
deal
about
the
various
winter
sports
of
norway
capercailzie
stalking
bear
hunting
elk
and
reindeer
shooting
and
running
on
skier
the
of
the
country
which
are
very
different
from
the
canadian
shoes
being
made
of
wood
from
six
to
twelve
feet
long
four
inches
wide
in
front
three
behind
about
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
where
the
foot
rests
thinner
at
each
end
and
turned
up
and
pointed
in
front
every
district
has
its
own
peculiar
shape
about
here
the
right
shoe
is
made
six
feet
long
the
left
one
ten
or
eleven
feet
it
being
more
easy
to
turn
if
one
is
shorter
than
the
other
some
are
made
of
pine
some
of
birch
and
occasionally
oak
the
men
of
the
thellemarken
are
the
most
skilful
runners
but
it
is
now
quite
a
fashionable
amusement
in
christiania
during
the
winter
just
as
skating
is
in
england
august
our
norwegian
friends
departed
for
the
happy
of
rus
vand
this
morning
but
before
doing
so
they
most
kindly
offered
us
the
hut
there
any
time
after
this
week
at
the
end
of
which
they
are
going
south
we
can
hardly
expect
the
present
glorious
weather
which
has
now
lasted
for
three
weeks
to
go
on
for
ever
and
when
the
change
comes
a
tent
will
no
longer
be
the
abode
of
comfort
and
luxury
that
we
at
present
find
it
so
that
the
offer
of
the
hut
is
most
opportune
for
us
we
parted
with
great
regret
from
people
who
have
been
so
kind
and
hospitable
and
many
were
the
expressions
of
and
protestations
of
eternal
friendship
as
we
shall
not
see
them
again
till
we
pass
through
christiania
on
our
return
home
that
return
home
has
caused
the
skipper
hours
of
anxious
thought
already
there
is
to
be
a
wedding
in
england
about
the
end
of
next
month
at
which
although
it
is
not
his
own
his
presence
is
urgently
needed
he
knows
he
ought
to
go
but
hates
to
leave
this
blissful
life
just
when
the
best
stalking
is
beginning
consequently
he
devotes
much
time
every
day
to
the
consideration
of
the
subject
torn
by
doubts
tortured
by
terrible
misgivings
and
harassed
by
indecision
after
being
more
than
usually
disagreeable
under
the
malign
influence
of
his
conscience
and
seeking
for
inspiration
first
in
the
room
at
gjendesheim
walking
up
and
down
like
weston
then
on
the
lake
paddling
like
a
penny
boat
and
finally
roosting
on
a
rock
at
the
top
of
the
fjeld
with
his
arms
folded
like
napoleon
and
a
gruesome
scowl
on
his
face
or
at
least
on
those
portions
of
it
which
were
visible
through
the
mask
of
gjende
flies
he
at
last
concluded
to
commit
his
fate
to
the
decision
of
an
unbiassed
coin
if
such
could
be
obtained
from
any
confiding
friend
with
great
difficulty
he
persuaded
esau
to
lend
him
one
öre
value
of
a
shilling
which
seems
on
reckoning
to
be
about
half
a
farthing
esau
observing
as
he
gave
it
it
isn
t
that
i
m
stingy
old
fellow
though
of
course
i
don
t
expect
to
see
it
again
but
it
throw
my
accounts
out
esau
s
notion
of
keeping
accounts
is
to
put
his
receipts
into
one
pocket
his
disbursements
into
if
he
has
a
vague
idea
to
within
or
so
of
how
the
money
has
gone
it
will
be
more
than
any
one
expects
that
everything
he
possesses
will
be
spent
is
a
foregone
conclusion
but
to
resume
the
öre
coin
has
no
distinct
head
or
tail
so
the
skipper
named
one
side
heads
and
tossed
the
thing
fell
on
its
edge
and
rolled
round
the
table
and
about
the
room
till
it
struck
the
wall
whereupon
it
fell
over
heads
and
decided
that
the
skipper
must
go
to
the
wedding
so
he
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
saying
that
they
must
not
expect
him
and
that
he
should
stay
out
here
the
whole
time
that
was
originally
intended
for
as
soon
as
he
had
dated
the
letter
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
be
childish
to
allow
such
a
weighty
matter
to
be
decided
by
the
whim
of
a
coin
which
might
very
likely
be
interested
in
the
affair
in
some
way
and
which
as
he
truly
said
would
possibly
have
turned
up
tails
if
it
had
not
happened
to
fall
on
its
edge
and
been
interfered
with
by
an
unauthorized
wall
having
thus
acted
according
to
his
inclinations
and
given
his
missive
to
andreas
to
post
when
he
leaves
gjendesheim
next
week
the
skipper
became
quite
pleasant
again
and
went
forth
to
his
fishing
ever
and
all
so
gaily
the
ponies
of
norway
are
wonderfully
docile
and
clever
these
qualities
were
well
shown
in
a
black
one
belonging
to
jens
which
came
to
take
f
s
baggage
over
the
mountain
to
rus
vand
this
pony
was
brought
down
near
the
door
of
the
and
left
standing
there
without
any
fastening
or
any
one
to
look
after
him
the
things
were
not
ready
so
he
waited
about
two
hours
occasionally
wiping
off
the
gjende
flies
with
his
tail
when
their
weight
became
insupportable
but
otherwise
never
moving
the
busy
world
consisting
of
andreas
and
ragnild
pursued
their
usual
avocations
around
him
goats
ran
against
him
and
insects
climbed
over
him
but
there
he
stood
placid
and
motionless
as
a
wooden
at
last
the
baggage
was
ready
and
they
brought
it
out
and
piled
it
on
his
back
until
we
feared
he
would
break
and
then
jens
turned
his
head
in
the
direction
of
rus
vand
and
gave
him
a
gentle
push
to
start
him
and
he
went
slowly
off
up
the
mountain
choosing
the
best
way
for
himself
for
no
one
went
with
him
in
fact
jens
did
not
follow
him
for
about
half
an
hour
but
no
doubt
he
was
found
at
the
right
place
in
the
end
the
whole
performance
reminded
one
of
a
clockwork
toy
and
john
remarked
as
we
stood
and
watched
him
out
of
sight
over
the
pass
now
that
s
what
i
call
a
during
our
stay
here
we
had
the
pleasure
of
forming
the
acquaintance
of
an
this
animal
is
taken
out
in
a
kind
of
harness
to
which
a
rope
is
fastened
the
other
end
of
the
rope
being
attached
to
the
hunter
s
belt
and
his
legitimate
occupation
is
finding
elk
in
a
forest
by
scent
and
denoting
their
presence
by
his
behaviour
before
the
hunter
gets
within
range
of
the
elk
s
eyes
ears
or
nose
thomas
brought
him
up
here
hoping
to
find
reindeer
with
him
in
the
same
manner
as
he
had
been
unable
to
get
a
finmarker
broken
to
reindeer
but
the
experiment
has
not
been
successful
for
the
dog
has
been
so
carefully
trained
to
elk
that
he
exhibits
a
large
and
lofty
contempt
for
so
pusillanimous
a
creature
as
a
reindeer
and
will
not
confess
that
he
has
discovered
the
existence
of
such
a
thing
at
all
footnote
finmarker
is
the
kind
of
dog
usually
employed
for
finding
reindeer
the
name
being
derived
from
the
district
of
which
it
is
a
native
but
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
he
finds
no
deer
he
is
a
good
deal
of
trouble
from
the
fastidiousness
of
his
appetite
it
appears
that
he
is
accustomed
to
feed
on
dogs
and
when
he
can
not
get
dogs
he
can
rough
it
very
well
for
a
short
time
on
boys
or
any
other
plain
fare
but
up
here
where
dogs
are
few
and
boys
are
extinct
he
is
having
a
very
poor
time
of
it
the
last
place
where
he
had
a
really
square
meal
was
at
skjæggestad
on
the
journey
up
where
he
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
whole
dog
and
some
portions
of
boy
since
then
he
has
only
had
limbs
snatched
off
adventurous
observers
and
altogether
seems
to
be
pining
for
want
of
proper
nourishment
he
is
about
the
height
of
a
colley
but
with
an
enormous
chest
and
limbs
a
head
something
like
an
esquimaux
a
wiry
reddish
yellow
coat
and
a
most
unkindly
expression
of
countenance
in
the
absence
of
sufficient
flesh
food
he
appears
to
be
developing
a
liking
for
so
we
did
not
remain
long
in
his
society
for
which
indeed
we
only
craved
after
we
had
perceived
through
a
chink
in
the
door
of
his
dwelling
that
he
was
moored
to
a
beam
by
a
kind
of
anchor
chain
we
have
often
heard
that
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
danger
in
the
pursuit
of
the
elk
if
the
hunter
is
always
accompanied
by
a
dog
of
this
kind
we
can
easily
understand
it
however
he
was
a
very
interesting
animal
and
if
we
had
a
national
school
at
memurudalen
we
should
certainly
have
tried
to
buy
him
as
there
is
any
amount
of
room
for
there
what
a
boon
he
would
be
in
some
of
the
thickly
populated
districts
of
england
in
the
afternoon
we
paddled
leisurely
back
to
our
camp
and
found
it
looking
prettier
than
ever
but
alas
our
little
stream
had
ceased
to
run
however
there
is
another
one
not
more
than
forty
yards
away
so
we
shall
not
be
much
troubled
by
its
loss
the
sun
still
shines
upon
us
from
a
cloudless
sky
and
early
in
the
morning
before
any
breeze
springs
up
the
lake
makes
a
most
beautiful
picture
with
its
steep
mountain
sides
and
foaming
torrents
so
perfectly
reflected
in
the
green
unruffled
water
but
lovely
as
it
is
its
beauty
is
rather
wasted
on
us
now
for
it
has
been
just
the
same
for
the
last
three
weeks
with
the
outlines
all
hard
and
clearly
defined
and
none
of
the
graduated
effects
of
distance
which
we
get
from
the
hazy
climate
at
home
in
this
clear
atmosphere
the
peaks
twenty
miles
away
are
as
bright
as
those
a
mile
or
so
beyond
the
lake
probably
this
is
the
reason
why
we
so
seldom
see
pictures
of
norwegian
mountain
scenery
and
that
the
few
which
do
appear
are
often
condemned
as
hard
cold
and
unsatisfactory
the
most
prominent
object
in
looking
towards
the
lake
from
our
camp
is
a
curious
pyramidal
mound
about
thirty
feet
high
close
to
the
water
s
edge
it
is
so
regular
in
shape
that
we
have
devoted
many
hours
of
cogitation
and
argument
to
the
discovery
of
its
history
john
who
is
a
man
of
considerable
archæological
fame
maintains
that
it
is
a
funeral
barrow
in
which
some
ancient
viking
was
buried
and
he
wants
us
to
give
up
our
cartridges
for
the
purpose
of
constructing
a
mine
and
blasting
him
out
we
have
vainly
represented
to
him
that
it
can
not
be
a
viking
s
tomb
because
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
vike
up
here
the
skipper
says
it
is
a
glacial
moraine
any
donkey
can
see
that
at
a
glance
and
esau
holds
to
the
opinion
that
it
is
an
artificial
mound
put
up
for
ancient
regiments
of
gjendin
yeomen
and
memurudalen
militia
to
practise
archery
at
possibly
none
of
these
theories
give
the
correct
solution
but
whatever
its
origin
it
makes
a
capital
rifle
butt
for
our
occasional
shooting
esau
was
heard
to
irreverently
remark
as
he
aimed
at
it
with
the
skipper
s
rifle
he
guessed
an
express
bullet
would
rouse
old
jarl
hakon
out
of
that
but
nothing
particular
followed
the
skipper
composed
an
irish
stew
as
a
de
which
when
it
came
to
table
was
unanimously
voted
the
best
of
all
the
excellent
dishes
on
which
we
have
feasted
here
after
dinner
we
made
an
enormous
fire
for
the
sole
purpose
of
warmth
as
the
nights
are
now
very
cold
and
during
this
fine
weather
after
sunset
a
strong
draught
sets
down
our
valley
towards
the
lake
we
have
ascertained
that
a
like
draught
blows
down
each
of
the
other
valleys
running
into
gjendin
making
the
lake
a
centre
that
in
ours
begins
gently
directly
the
sun
has
set
and
increases
in
strength
until
it
amounts
to
a
stiff
breeze
and
as
it
comes
direct
from
the
vast
snow
fjelds
it
is
a
disagreeably
chilly
blast
which
freezes
that
side
of
our
bodies
remote
from
the
fire
and
leads
us
to
envy
the
happy
condition
of
a
leg
of
mutton
attached
to
a
that
o
nimium
fortunatum
enjoys
equally
in
every
part
the
genial
warmth
while
man
has
no
mechanical
arrangement
by
which
his
immortal
soul
can
be
rendered
blissful
through
the
medium
of
a
temperate
body
in
the
morning
a
breeze
begins
to
blow
out
of
the
lake
into
all
the
valleys
illustrating
on
a
small
scale
the
cause
of
land
and
sea
breezes
all
over
the
world
the
skipper
and
john
who
is
a
man
of
profound
science
have
elaborated
a
theory
explaining
the
exact
reason
of
this
interesting
phenomenon
but
as
their
explanation
is
entirely
opposed
to
the
teachings
of
dr
brewer
and
the
opinions
of
professor
tyndall
and
involves
a
rearrangement
of
existing
notions
concerning
radiation
and
the
movements
of
the
heavenly
bodies
we
think
it
best
to
exclude
it
from
these
pages
as
this
is
not
a
simply
scientific
work
and
we
have
no
desire
to
hurt
the
feelings
of
even
the
misguided
philosophers
chapter
xxvi
disaster
we
have
got
quite
tired
of
writing
another
beautiful
day
and
in
future
shall
bring
notebooks
to
norway
with
these
words
ready
printed
at
the
top
of
each
page
the
skipper
paddled
away
to
gjendebod
to
bring
home
the
deerskin
which
he
had
left
there
to
dry
he
returned
with
a
splendid
bag
of
the
best
trout
that
ever
came
out
of
gjendin
and
that
means
the
best
in
the
world
but
he
was
in
a
state
of
great
indignation
because
he
had
been
charged
for
beds
dinners
and
breakfasts
for
himself
and
öla
when
they
stayed
there
a
few
nights
ago
this
is
the
result
of
living
in
a
cheap
country
for
two
months
to
the
ordinary
englishman
it
would
not
appear
an
exorbitant
hotel
bill
especially
when
the
hotel
is
fifty
miles
from
a
town
and
only
open
for
two
months
in
the
year
just
at
bedtime
esau
crawled
into
the
tent
saying
that
he
had
strained
his
back
in
lifting
a
stone
he
was
in
such
pain
that
he
could
hardly
stand
and
was
white
and
shivering
we
undressed
him
and
put
him
to
bed
and
then
produced
the
liniment
from
the
medicine
chest
by
which
name
we
dignify
the
which
contains
our
little
stock
of
drugs
then
john
spent
an
hour
viciously
rubbing
remedies
into
his
victim
s
back
as
one
rubs
oil
into
a
bat
so
that
esau
presently
groaned
out
thanks
john
i
think
that
will
do
i
feel
a
great
deal
better
now
and
certainly
he
did
seem
to
experience
a
kind
of
relief
as
soon
as
the
rubbing
stopped
after
this
we
turned
in
esau
spent
a
sleepless
night
and
this
morning
could
not
move
thereupon
john
nobly
closed
with
him
for
another
s
rubbing
which
had
a
decided
effect
and
after
giving
him
some
breakfast
we
carried
him
out
and
made
a
comfortable
bed
for
him
under
the
sycamine
tree
and
there
left
him
with
the
library
and
all
his
belongings
in
easy
reach
at
midday
john
returned
from
fishing
to
lunch
with
the
invalid
and
we
wondered
how
all
our
friends
in
england
were
getting
on
with
the
partridges
and
almost
wished
we
were
there
for
a
few
minutes
as
we
pictured
to
ourselves
eddie
and
jack
both
talking
sixteen
to
the
dozen
at
lunch
over
beefsteak
pie
and
beer
fancy
beer
john
old
blank
with
two
young
dogs
tied
to
him
perspiring
over
the
downs
and
the
major
sitting
with
his
cigar
aboard
the
yacht
at
cowes
and
thinking
how
snug
his
birds
were
lying
down
gorseham
way
not
to
be
disturbed
till
his
return
next
month
to
shoot
at
them
while
all
the
time
the
furzely
boys
were
walking
them
up
and
making
them
as
wild
as
hawks
after
lunch
john
accomplished
what
has
long
been
his
great
desire
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
across
the
memurua
and
after
boiling
a
thermometer
at
the
topmost
peak
burying
a
pocket
handkerchief
thoughtfully
borrowed
from
esau
who
was
too
unwell
to
refuse
him
anything
and
carving
his
name
on
the
newgate
stone
with
his
tollekniv
fine
tra
la
he
returned
in
raptures
about
the
view
and
overcome
with
sublime
and
poetical
emotions
which
did
not
subside
until
he
had
poured
forth
his
soul
to
his
two
friends
at
dinner
the
skipper
stalked
without
success
though
he
found
the
tracks
of
a
good
herd
that
had
only
just
passed
over
the
ground
though
the
day
was
so
pleasant
he
had
not
exactly
enjoyed
his
walk
for
he
could
not
help
being
filled
with
gloomy
forebodings
about
esau
picturing
to
himself
the
difficulties
that
would
arise
in
getting
men
to
carry
the
invalid
down
to
christiania
in
a
litter
with
him
yelling
at
every
step
but
behold
how
untrustworthy
a
thing
is
imagination
when
the
skipper
arrived
in
camp
he
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
the
object
of
his
solicitude
sitting
up
and
actually
stirring
the
rice
for
the
curry
so
marvellous
had
been
the
effect
of
john
s
lubrication
assisted
by
the
support
to
his
back
of
a
kind
of
splint
composed
of
birch
bark
a
towel
and
two
straps
john
ate
new
bread
again
for
dinner
yesterday
and
the
skipper
was
aroused
in
the
middle
of
the
night
by
a
claw
reaching
out
from
the
adjoining
bed
which
clutched
his
pillow
and
rug
and
tried
to
drag
them
away
the
whole
of
this
being
accompanied
by
groans
and
hideous
yells
he
became
more
peaceful
after
a
short
time
but
the
skipper
is
now
in
mortal
fear
lest
john
should
again
suffer
from
indigestion
and
again
stretch
out
that
gruesome
claw
and
grabbing
him
by
the
hair
drag
him
forth
from
the
tent
and
with
demoniac
shrieks
stamp
the
life
out
of
his
frail
body
while
he
makes
the
quiet
valley
to
his
triumphant
mocking
laughter
this
the
skipper
asserts
would
be
only
one
step
beyond
his
conduct
of
last
night
the
latest
scientific
observations
have
caused
us
to
the
different
altitudes
thus
first
the
country
of
high
cultivation
and
wild
strawberries
above
that
the
zone
of
uncleared
pine
forests
and
most
of
the
berries
then
the
belt
of
stunted
birches
and
black
game
higher
still
that
of
cows
and
goats
and
above
that
the
country
where
reindeer
flourish
and
snow
lies
all
the
year
round
this
takes
us
to
the
summit
of
all
things
earthly
and
in
this
zone
there
is
hardly
any
vegetation
beyond
it
is
the
region
of
eagles
but
in
the
present
incomplete
state
of
human
knowledge
we
have
been
content
to
explore
this
highest
zone
by
letting
our
spirits
soar
aloft
without
our
bodies
gjendin
is
just
at
the
highest
point
of
the
belt
and
when
the
wind
gets
into
the
the
thermometer
without
waiting
to
reflect
falls
a
great
distance
very
hurriedly
john
having
no
sheepskin
suffers
a
good
deal
from
the
cold
at
night
and
the
haughtiness
of
his
spirit
is
so
far
broken
that
he
now
sleeps
in
two
pairs
of
trousers
three
shirts
and
a
coat
besides
all
his
rugs
a
few
short
weeks
ago
he
turned
from
us
with
an
air
of
aristocratic
nausea
when
we
were
getting
into
bed
clothed
in
a
single
shirt
and
pair
of
trousers
donning
for
his
part
a
linen
nightshirt
an
effeminacy
previously
unheard
of
in
camp
life
these
things
are
changed
now
and
it
is
difficult
to
persuade
him
not
to
go
to
bed
with
his
boots
on
but
it
has
to
be
prevented
on
account
of
the
new
bread
the
monotony
of
an
uneventful
day
was
only
broken
by
the
occasional
rubbing
of
esau
s
back
amidst
the
victim
s
agonised
appeals
for
mercy
as
he
thinks
it
is
rubbed
away
to
the
bone
however
the
effect
is
magnificent
and
he
can
now
hobble
about
camp
and
be
useful
to
a
certain
extent

we
placed
a

notwithstanding
the
improvement
of
course
esau
was
not
fit
to
go
stalking
and
this
and
other
reasons
suddenly
induced
us
to
leave
memurudalen
for
good
and
go
to
gjendesheim
on
our
way
to
rus
vand
so
we
made
a
last
gigantic
pie
packed
up
lunched
and
then
pulled
down
the
tent
which
had
been
standing
so
long
now
on
the
same
spot
and
embarked
everything
on
board
our
two
canoes
and
the
gjendesheim
boat
which
had
been
lent
to
us
then
the
whole
fleet
sailed
from
these
hospitable
shores
neath
a
stormy
sky
with
cold
wind
and
rain
and
the
towering
heights
of
memurutungen
all
wrapped
in
angry
clouds
frowning
blackly
above
us
it
was
quite
sad
to
leave
the
snug
little
corner
where
we
have
spent
such
a
happy
careless
time
with
all
the
comforts
which
we
have
added
gradually
to
our
temporary
home
and
the
valley
looked
very
desolate
without
the
tent
the
cheerful
fire
and
the
meteor
esau
s
last
act
was
to
fill
two
brass
cartridge
cases
with
water
and
hammer
them
firmly
into
each
other
the
boiler
so
formed
he
put
into
the
fire
under
the
oven
and
after
waiting
a
short
time
for
the
explosion
forgot
all
about
it
and
went
away
without
telling
any
one
just
then
john
arrived
at
the
spot
to
see
if
there
were
any
loose
belongings
lying
about
and
was
horrified
to
observe
the
oven
suddenly
elevate
itself
into
the
air
and
disappear
among
the
clouds
with
a
loud
report
his
mind
at
once
reverted
to
the
happy
life
of
a
landlord
in
co
limerick
but
he
soon
realised
the
true
state
of
affairs
and
came
down
to
the
lake
muttering
something
about
tomdamfoolery
a
norwegian
word
which
expresses
censure
of
the
silly
custom
of
practical
joking
this
morning
we
found
a
merlin
sitting
just
outside
the
tent
door
it
had
evidently
been
stuffing
itself
with
scraps
of
offal
from
the
camp
until
it
was
perfectly
stupid
and
could
scarcely
fly
esau
wanted
to
knock
it
on
the
head
at
first
but
more
humane
feelings
came
over
him
so
he
fetched
his
rifle
and
shot
it
for
an
hour
or
so
till
at
length
the
bird
wearied
by
the
constant
noise
retired
into
the
birch
woods
and
we
saw
it
no
more
there
are
usually
several
ravens
near
the
camp
which
come
down
to
carry
off
carrion
but
otherwise
there
are
not
many
birds
here
the
most
common
are
buzzards
and
kestrels
which
abound
two
eagles
which
are
generally
soaring
above
memurutungen
a
pair
of
ospreys
occasionally
flying
about
the
lake
a
buzzard
seen
once
a
few
merlins
and
a
small
red
hawk
with
whom
we
are
not
acquainted
sometimes
divers
and
scaups
on
the
lake
and
a
few
fieldfares
and
redwings
in
the
birch
woods
we
have
found
many
nests
of
the
latter
in
the
trees
and
one
of
a
fieldfare
in
a
bank
what
rare
times
all
the
birds
and
beasts
of
prey
will
have
for
the
next
few
days
in
memurudalen
only
to
be
equalled
by
the
early
days
of
the
australian
gold
fever
nuggets
of
inestimable
value
in
the
shape
of
heads
tails
and
other
portions
of
reindeer
ryper
duck
and
trout
intermingled
with
other
delicacies
such
as
potato
skins
jam
and
marmalade
pots
and
whisky
bottles
will
from
time
to
time
be
unearthed
amidst
shrieks
of
triumph
claims
will
be
run
up
to
a
fabulous
price
and
many
a
battle
royal
will
be
fought
in
that
happy
valley
where
we
have
spent
a
month
of
peace
as
we
depart
in
mournful
silence
brooding
over
the
days
that
are
no
more
we
see
in
fancy
the
numerous
bright
eyes
which
from
lairs
and
eyries
are
watching
our
every
move
their
owners
all
ready
to
swoop
down
on
our
as
soon
as
we
have
passed
out
of
sight
the
lake
was
very
rough
and
we
were
quite
afraid
of
being
swamped
and
losing
our
baggage
from
the
magnitude
of
the
big
little
waves
but
luckily
the
boat
took
our
heaviest
things
or
we
should
not
have
been
able
to
venture
and
so
the
canoes
lightly
loaded
and
with
all
sail
set
rode
gallantly
o
er
the
foaming
billows
and
we
all
got
safe
to
gjendesheim
the
cheery
fire
in
the
room
with
its
bare
wooden
walls
and
benches
made
a
picture
which
seemed
the
perfection
of
comfort
after
the
chilly
tent
and
the
freezing
wind
it
is
the
black
that
makes
brave
englishmen
use
very
naughty
words
and
wish
themselves
at
home
one
of
the
party
is
always
telling
us
that
he
intends
to
inflict
on
the
british
public
a
narration
of
our
experiences
on
this
expedition
and
although
he
has
not
yet
begun
to
collect
materials
for
the
work
we
have
begun
to
invent
titles
for
the
book
that
is
to
be
one
is
england
canada
and
norway
being
a
description
of
englishmen
travelling
in
norway
with
canadian
canoes
and
we
think
this
title
might
induce
schoolmasters
to
buy
it
under
the
impression
that
it
is
a
geographical
treatise
on
those
countries
the
skipper
proposed
the
fool
with
the
or
fishing
and
john
s
title
was
mems
from
memurudalen
or
jottings
from
the
jotunfjeld
and
esau
suggested
glopit
top
it
and
mop
it
alluding
he
said
to
the
state
of
john
s
forehead
whenever
he
arrived
at
the
summit
of
that
mountain
but
the
explanation
was
received
with
such
a
chorus
of
oh
drop
it
stop
it
from
the
others
that
he
gave
up
the
idea
the
original
is
printed
between
lines
drop
oh
it
stop
one
notion
is
to
make
the
book
a
collection
of
cooking
recipes
for
camp
life
and
call
it
grunts
from
a
gourmand
in
gulbrandsdalen
or
paragraphs
from
the
pen
of
a
pig
but
we
think
we
should
promote
a
more
active
sale
among
respectable
people
if
it
were
called
or
lights
thrown
on
good
another
idea
is
that
it
might
get
a
sale
by
appearing
surreptitiously
among
the
christmas
books
for
the
young
and
for
that
purpose
we
should
use
the
names
of
our
two
henchmen
anglicised
oola
and
eva
a
tale
for
girls
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
favourable
attention
of
parents
and
guardians
possibly
it
might
create
a
greater
sensation
if
it
were
introduced
to
the
world
as
julia
and
pausanias
an
it
is
very
difficult
to
decide
on
a
good
name
but
we
are
all
agreed
that
the
name
once
found
it
will
be
perfectly
easy
to
write
the
book
afterwards
how
soothing
and
pleasant
it
is
when
we
hear
the
storm
and
rain
shrieking
and
beating
outside
to
reflect
that
there
is
a
good
solid
roof
over
our
heads
and
that
we
shall
not
be
roused
in
the
night
by
the
cry
of
all
hands
turn
out
to
slack
off
this
morning
the
lake
was
so
rough
that
we
perceived
that
we
had
been
very
lucky
to
make
our
voyage
yesterday
we
certainly
could
not
have
attempted
it
the
man
from
gjendebod
was
here
and
started
for
the
other
end
of
the
lake
with
andreas
in
the
big
boat
about
nine
o
clock
but
at
two
they
came
back
dead
beat
and
wet
through
having
been
obliged
to
desist
from
their
attempt
before
they
had
gone
two
miles
and
they
considered
themselves
lucky
to
have
got
back

the
appearance
of
the

is
wonderfully
fine
as
the
breakers
come
rolling
in
flinging
the
spray
high
up
the
face
of
the
opposing
cliffs
and
dashing
with
an
angry
roar
against
the
black

they
jut
out

the

affirming
that
he
could
smell

salt
in
the
air
began
to
look

while

put
on
a
beautiful
shooting
coat

went
down
to
the
shore
to
pick
up
seaweed
and
dig
on
the
sands
he
came
back
saying
that
the
tide
was
coming
in
and
he
thought
he
had
seen
the
smoke
of
a
steamer
in
the
offing
close
to
this
end
of
the
lake
a
little
promontory
runs
out
which
forms
a
breakwater
so
that
the
sea
just
opposite
the
house
is
comparatively
calm
in
this
bay
directly
after
breakfast
we
saw
two
scaups
and
the
skipper
and
esau
manned
a
canoe
to
try
for
them
the
former
to
paddle
the
latter
to
shoot
only
one
was
shot
at
and
it
managed
to
fly
beyond
the
headland
before
falling
dead
and
we
dare
not
go
after
it
in
our
frail
craft

took
all
the
male
inhabitants
of
this

öla
ivar
and
andreas
to
act
as
spaniels
and
retrievers
and
went
into
the
fjeld
above
gjendesheim
for
ryper
we
had
quite
a
sporting
afternoon
as
we
managed
to
find
a
good
many
broods
the
strong
wind
had
made
them
so
much
wilder
that
they
got
up
with
reasonable
haste
and
energy
instead
of
waiting
to
be
kicked
and
then
only
running
away

we
had
great
fun
also
in
watching
the
behaviour
of
our
men
especially
their
method
of
capturing
a
wounded
bird
one
which
was
hit
in
the
head
had
dropped
among
some
rocks
and
öla
and
andreas
went
in
pursuit
they
crawled
suspiciously
about
peering
over
the
stones
as
if
they
were
stalking
reindeer
then
suddenly
catching
sight
of
the
bird
which
was
crouching
down
as
birds
hit
in
the
head
sometimes

they
advanced
cautiously
upon
it
each
with
an
uplifted
stick
in
his
hand
and
crept
like
assassins
nearer
and
nearer

their
victim

at

into

large
brood

picking
up
a
solitary
old
cock
that
had
selfishly
separated
himself
from
his
family
and
selected
a
particularly
advantageous
for
his
own
exclusive
benefit
and
at
intervals
having
a
little
recreation
afforded
by
our
men
especially
the
professional

one
marshy
bit

ground
a

of
owls
were
incautious
enough
to
fly
up
in

of
esau
and
were
promptly
added
to
the
bag
they
were
in
beautiful
plumage
which
was
luckily
not
injured
by
the
shot
so
we
were
much
pleased
at
getting
them
then
we
went
towards
the
river
into
the
ground
frequented
by
ducks
and
got
a
little
shooting
there
and
finished
the
day
by
walking
round
the
shoulder
of
the
lower
fjeld
about
the
time
that
the
ryper
were
coming
there
to
feed
and
so
back
to
gjendesheim
altogether
the
walk
was
most
enjoyable
and
as
we
returned
and
gazed
over
gjendin
the
contrasts
of
storm
and
sunshine
tumbled
clouds
and
rough
waters
and
occasional
glimpses
of
the
highest
mountains
gleaming
through
rifts
in
the
surrounding
blackness
as
the
bright
sunbeams
lighted
up
their
peaks
of
snow
formed
the
most
striking
picture
of
wild
and
desolate
grandeur
that
can
be
imagined
esau
s
shooting
is
remarkably
unerring
and
we
feel
so
annoyed
with
him
sometimes
when
he
miss
even
a
palpably
difficult
chance
that
we
were
quite
glad
a
few
days
ago
when
he
took
such
a
long
shot
that
it
strained
his
gun
and
the
skipper
exclaimed
ah
i
told

you
would

ve

john
and
the
skipper
upsetting
in
the
canoe
john
had
an
unstrung
kind
of
day
starting
down
the
river
to
fish
soon
after
breakfast
he
became
so
engrossed
in
his
sport
that
he
forgot
all
about
lunch
and
did
not
return
till
when
he
walked
abstractedly
into
the
room
where
we
were
sitting
and
pulled
out
his
watch
then
after
studying
it
and
making
calculations
for
a
short
time
he
remarked
slowly
i
left
here
at
six
minutes
past
ten
and
hanged
if
it
isn
t
ten
minutes
past
six
now
my
watch
must
have
then
he
wandered
off
upstairs
to
his
room
still
ruminating
over
this
extraordinary
occurrence
to
his
watch
but
in
his
absence
ragnild
had
changed
all
his
things
into
another
cabin
without
telling
him
anything
about
it
so
that
he
found
his
old
habitation
swept
and
garnished
and
began
to
think
like
clever
alice
this
is
none
of
however
he
got
over
this
difficulty
and
came
down
to
dinner
still
looking
a
trifle
abstracted
but
with
his
usual
appetite
afterwards
the
skipper
paddled
him
across
the
river
to
fish
and
when
coming
back
john
upset
the
canoe
and
nearly
drowned
them
both
in
the
presence
of
esau
and
every
native
in
the
district
who
joined
in
mocking
them
in
the
norwegian
tongue
from
the
bank
finally
he
informed
us
that
during
his
wanderings
he
had
composed
a
short
poem
which
said
he
as
you
have
not
heard
it
i
will
now
proceed
to
so
we
went
to
bed
chapter
xxviii
september
the
skipper
and
esau
determined
to
try
to
run
the
canoes
down
the
river
to
sjödals
lake
where
we
intend
to
leave
them
during
our
stay
at
rus
vand
all
things
being
ready
the
skipper
started
about
eleven
o
clock
on
his
perilous
voyage
closely
followed
by
esau
the
river
is
full
of
impracticable
falls
some
of
them
twenty
or
thirty
feet
high
but
between
these
places
there
are
splendid
rapids
and
the
excitement
of
running
them
is
delightfully
fascinating
when
we
came
to
a
bad
fall
we
carried
the
canoes
round
and
enlisted
the
services
of
our
two
men
to
help
us
in
this
part
of
the
performance
öla
did
not
like
this
at
all
for
carrying
a
canoe
of
lbs
weight
over
very
rough
ground
is
hard
work
and
öla
loveth
the
fireside
and
the
odour
of
roasting
coffee
better
than
hard
work
on
the
sabbath
presently
we
came
to
a
place
which
the
skipper
wanted
to
run
but
which
esau
declared
to
be
too
dangerous
it
was
a
very
swift
and
rocky
rapid
with
two
extremely
sudden
turns
the
lower
of
which
was
only
a
few
yards
above
a
high
fall
esau
only
ran
past
the
first
turn
which
was
quite
nervous
work
enough
and
then
got
to
shore
and
waited
on
the
bank
for
the
result
of
the
skipper
s
exploit
down
he
came
at
about
fifteen
miles
an
hour
took
the
first
turn
most
successfully
and
then
by
some
extraordinary
strokes
of
his
paddle
which
no
man
living
but
himself
could
have
performed
and
aided
by
a
species
of
miracle
he
got
round
the
second
but
then
an
eddy
caught
the
canoe
and
she
became
unmanageable
so
that
instead
of
stopping
in
a
little
creek
of
quiet
water
as
he
intended
he
came
straight
on
at
a
terrific
speed
and
ran
high
and
dry
on
a
ledge
of
rock
just
above
the
fall
losing
his
paddle
at
the
shock
wonderful
to
relate
the
canoe
was
not
a
bit
injured
but
the
paddle
whirled
over
the
abyss
and
disappeared
for
ever
and
the
skipper
was
pleased
because
he
had
not
done
the
same
we
spent
five
hours
in
this
kind
of
amusement
and
enjoyed
it
almost
more
than
anything
else
we
have
done
the
constant
danger
of
a
smash
or
an
upset
the
sensation
of
speed
the
delight
of
the
sudden
rush
to
the
gliding
dip
over
a
fall
with
the
water
roaring
past
a
rock
on
each
side
the
big
waves
below
the
fall
which
catch
the
canoe
and
toss
it
from
one
to
another
till
you
feel
as
if
you
must
be
thrown
out
and
the
curious
appearance
that
the
hurrying
waters
all
round
present
combine
to
make
sunday
a
very
popular
pursuit
while
we
were
doing
the
last
bit
above
sjödals
lake
our
men
instigated
no
doubt
by
öla
the
lazy
seized
the
opportunity
given
by
a
long
rapid
to
go
home
and
as
we
were
pretty
well
tired
out
with
our
exertions
we
left
the
canoes
above
the
lowest
fall
and
walked
back
to
gjendesheim
but
we
can
not
recommend
this
river
to
future
voyageurs
there
are
too
many
places
that
can
not
be
run
and
we
hear
that
we
are
regarded
as
decidedly
mad
for
having
attempted
it
illustration
making
a
portage
by
the
sjoa
river
öla
our
stalker
is
a
man
whom
we
do
not
much
admire
he
is
a
big
handsome
fellow
with
a
light
beard
and
moustache
and
rather
a
weak
face
and
his
good
qualities
are
extreme
cleverness
at
almost
any
kind
of
work
carpentry
smith
s
work
needlework
and
saddlery
all
seem
to
come
alike
to
him
and
as
a
he
is
and
never
makes
a
mistake
but
we
fear
that
his
profession
at
home
is
to
be
an
independent
gentleman
and
he
is
very
lazy
and
nearly
always
sulky
this
sulkiness
annoys
us
more
than
anything
else
but
we
also
get
very
angry
with
him
for
being
afraid
of
everything
he
is
afraid
to
go
in
the
canoes
and
nothing
has
ever
induced
him
to
enter
either
of
them
he
is
afraid
of
rowing
against
a
wind
or
going
out
stalking
on
two
successive
days
lest
he
should
tire
himself
and
he
is
afraid
of
washing
up
plates
and
pans
lest
he
should
lose
dignity
but
it
does
not
bore
him
to
sit
by
and
watch
other
people
perform
the
operation
the
gjende
fly
was
a
marvellous
sight
we
thought
him
numerous
before
but
we
little
knew
the
accumulated
villany
of
which
this
noxious
creature
is
capable
every
fly
that
we
saw
here
a
week
ago
has
now
got
a
large
and
healthy
family
of
some
hundreds
and
a
darkness
which
may
be
felt
broods
over
the
river
and
its
shores
and
now
that
the
cold
weather
has
set
in
he
begins
to
perceive
that
his
short
but
effectual
career
of
annoyance
draws
near
to
its
close
and
the
whole
face
of
nature
is
covered
with
torpid
crawling
things
that
make
one
turn
in
disgust
from
everything
one
touches
may
his
end
come
soon
for
we
love
him
not
illustration
a
norwegian
we
are
very
comfortable
here
at
night
sitting
round
the
noble
fireplace
in
the
corner
of
the
room
these
corner
fireplaces
are
found
in
every
sæter
and
homestead
in
this
part
of
the
country
and
are
very
picturesque
and
cheery
vastly
superior
to
the
modern
stove
that
may
be
seen
standing
up
gaunt
and
inhospitable
in
every
house
in
more
civilised
regions
most
of
them
have
the
chimney
supported
by
a
crooked
piece
of
birch
wood
coming
down
from
the
roof
and
hooked
underneath
the
projecting
angle
of
stonework
but
in
some
there
is
instead
an
upright
iron
bar
from
the
hearth
generally
speaking
they
are
placed
quite
against
the
wall
in
the
corner
but
we
have
seen
several
with
a
space
behind
large
enough
to
walk
through
and
one
which
even
had
a
bed
behind
it
the
sea
on
gjendin
has
organised
something
remarkably
like
a
ground
swell
under
the
influence
of
the
continuous
storm
and
its
fury
is
more
magnificent
than
ever
no
boat
here
would
have
a
chance
of
living
in
it
esau
spent
the
morning
packing
his
in
a
wooden
box
for
their
journey
home
as
we
hardly
expect
to
get
much
more
in
the
way
of
specimens
then
we
had
another
afternoon
at
ryper
not
quite
so
lucky
as
yesterday
but
still
satisfactory
when
we
returned
we
found
that
andreas
had
brought
from
besse
sæter
a
vast
pile
of
literature
which
had
been
accumulating
at
the
vaage
post
office
for
the
last
month
after
dinner
when
we
were
all
buried
in
our
respective
letters
and
papers
occasionally
reading
out
particularly
interesting
scraps
of
news
ragnild
came
in
and
informed
us
that
a
certain
norwegian
whom
we
may
call
fox
had
come
there
to
fish
this
was
a
man
who
had
done
some
business
for
us
here
two
years
ago
and
we
had
had
a
little
correspondence
with
him
before
coming
out
this
year
thinking
we
might
have
given
him
some
trouble
and
not
having
any
great
liking
for
his
character
we
naturally
wished
to
be
especially
civil
to
him
so
we
asked
ragnild
to
bring
him
in
and
stay
to
interpret
for
us
presently
he
entered
the
room
and
after
greeting
us
sat
down
and
refused
to
have
anything
to
drink
this
astonished
us
so
much
that
it
completely
drove
our
small
stock
of
smaller
talk
out
of
our
heads
the
commonplaces
of
polite
conversation
sound
perfectly
ridiculous
when
gravely
uttered
to
an
interpreter
for
transmission
to
the
proper
recipient
and
so
ragnild
seemed
to
think
for
her
translation
always
sounded
much
shorter
than
our
flowery
sentences
we
tried
a
variety
of
feeble
questions
to
which
we
already
knew
the
answers
somewhat
in
the
following
style
we
presume
fox
that
you
like
norwegian
cheese
does
your
brother
also
like
norwegian
cheese
do
you
speak
german
no
but
your
brother
we
believe
plays
the
norwegian
the
friends
of
your
sister
s
children
are
also
our
friends
they
live
in
england
but
we
believe
they
still
like
norwegian
we
like
much
the
cheese
of
the
country
and
have
never
suffered
asphyxia
from
we
shall
take
a
small
quantity
with
us
to
england
for
the
destruction
of
rats
and
so
forth
presently
esau
getting
impatient
suggested
in
a
loud
voice
that
we
should
ask
him
some
questions
out
of
bennett
s
then
he
was
covered
with
shame
as
he
feared
that
ragnild
would
immediately
translate
this
to
fox
but
fortunately
she
did
not
on
reference
later
to
the
said
we
find
that
some
very
appropriate
and
useful
sentences
may
be
gleaned
from
its
fertile
pages
for
instance
who
are
you
what
sort
of
weather
is
it
these
two
remarks
are
introductory
as
it
were
and
to
inspire
confidence
in
the
person
addressed
then
we
come
to
the
point
will
you
lend
me
a
dollar
be
quick
thank
you
you
are
very
here
the
speaker
would
turn
to
ragnild
and
proceed
thus
put
this
in
my
carpet
bag
make
haste
and
bring
me
a
light
open
phaeton
carriage
drawn
by
one
then
to
fox
good
morning
i
must
go
but
i
shall
return
in
a
then
the
speaker
might
wink
at
john
and
depart
now
came
the
most
awful
pause
that
the
history
of
the
world
in
its
darkest
moments
can
yet
point
to
we
coughed
and
glared
at
each
other
and
felt
in
our
pockets
as
if
we
might
find
something
to
say
there
and
then
the
skipper
had
a
brilliant
idea
and
said
ask
fox
how
long
he
intends
to
stay
but
ragnild
at
once
replied
only
two
days
without
referring
the
question
to
him
at
all
so
that
remark
was
wasted
and
our
embarrassment
became
worse
than
ever
for
now
not
only
had
we
to
invent
subjects
of
conversation
but
also
to
put
them
in
such
a
form
that
ragnild
should
not
be
able
to
answer
them
without
taking
fox
into
her
confidence
he
all
the
time
was
most
annoying
as
he
would
do
literally
nothing
to
keep
up
his
end
of
the
conversation
and
replied
to
our
lengthiest
and
most
brilliant
efforts
of
exuberant
verbosity
by
monosyllables
and
inarticulate
grunts
at
last
in
desperation
we
presented
him
with
a
very
nice
new
english
knife
for
which
he
did
not
seem
to
care
at
all
and
so
we
parted
both
sides
feeling
that
the
interview
had
been
a
failure
the
following
note
is
extracted
from
one
of
the
journals
the
common
cheese
of
great
britain
is
unknown
in
norway
but
in
the
roadside
inn
the
smallest
sæter
or
farmhouse
and
the
humble
cottage
dwelling
the
traveller
can
always
obtain
that
excellent
substitute
the
goat
cheese
of
the
the
colour
of
this
excellent
substitute

at

sleeps
next

whistling
and
crowing
like

in

he
continues
these
little
games
long
after
and
though
he
is
wide
awake
will
get
up
all
this
sounds
very
pleasant
and
cheery
to
talk
about
but
the
skipper
who
usually
wakes
in
a
temper
the
reverse
of
angelic
being
influenced
by
an
unequal
liver
wishes
that
these
walls
were
twice
as
thick
and
that

was
at

generally
he
tries
little
stratagems
to
induce
esau
to
get
up
dressing
operations
having
a
tendency
to
quiet
him
sometimes
he
enters
the
room
sniffing
and
remarks
how
deuced
good
the
coffee
smells
roasting
or
we
re
going
to
have
a
fish
for
breakfast
but
there
s
very
little
of
that

left
enough
for
two
of
us

this
would
mean
about
eight
pounds
or
he
looks
out
of
the
window
and
assuming
an
attitude
of
intense
surprise
hanging
on
to
the
frame

there
s
a
fellow
just
below
looking
through
a
binocular
that
can
give

for

all
these
expedients
fail
he
gives
in
and
dresses
quickly
with
his
ears
full
of
tow
leaving
esau
aloft
and
gets
into
the
where
the
floor
and
ceiling
between
put
a
soft
pedal
on
operatic
selections
esau
says
all
this
arises
because

skipper
can
not

is

andreas

ragnild
are
making
preparations
for
their
departure
which
takes
place
then
gjendesheim
will
be
closed
the
door
fastened
the
windows
shuttered
and
the
place
will
be
left
to
itself
until
next
june
very
soon
now
gjendin
will
be
covered
with
ice
and
snow
most
of
the
good
folks
in
the
sæters
have
already
gone
to
the
valleys
for
the
winter
we
thought
it
would
be
more
convenient
for
them
if
we
took
our
departure
so
packed
our
goods
on
the
pony
and
said
farvel
to
gjendesheim
our
last
view
of
gjendin
as
we
turned
to
look
from
the
top
of
the
pass
was
just
as
it
appeared
when
we
first
saw
it
black
gloomy
and
forbidding
with
the
cold
north
wind
sweeping
in
a
hurricane
over
its
waters
and
heavy
hanging
over
its
mountain
shoulders
making
a
scene
as
awfully
lonely
and
desolate
as
it
is
possible
to
depict
illustration
jens
and
his
pony
on
their
way
over
bes
fjeld
after
the
pony
had
gone
with
the
last
load
we
suddenly
discovered
that
the
tent
had
been
forgotten
it
and
its
appurtenances
make
a
package
weighing
about
lbs
now
we
hate
carrying
but
fortunately
at
this
crisis
a
ex
appeared
in
the
person
of
a
stranger
at
first
we
thought
it
must
be
one
of
our
own
men
returning
for
something
after
changing
his
coat
but
on
his
nearer
approach
we
found
that
he
was
the
rest
of
the
population
of
the
district
whom
we
had
not
seen
before
coming
down
in
a
body
this
was
hans
kleven
who
has
the
reputation
of
being
the
best
hunter
in
the
country
he
is
a
small
sturdy
man
with
amazing
shoulders
and
a
pleasant
face
and
a
most
gorgeous
check
of
a
pattern
so
enormous
that
there
are
only
three
squares
on
the
whole
of
his
back
which
is
a
pretty
broad
one
this
coat
was
given
to
him
years
ago
apparently
about
by
an
english
sportsman
and
he
is
as
proud
of
it
as
ever
joseph
was
of
his
celebrated
garment
to
him
we
committed
our
tent
which
he
carried
over
to
besse
sæter
three
miles
away
without
turning
a
hair
we
rewarded
him
with
a
shilling
and
from
his
profuse
gratitude
we
conjecture
that
he
only
expected
fourpence
for
the
job
our
first
step
at
besse
sæter
was
as
usual
to
demand
food
and
john
asked
for
a
dish
called
tuk
melk
which
had
been
recommended
to
him
as
very
norwegian
and
very
good
a
woman
at
once
went
to
fetch
it
from
the
other
sæter
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
and
presently
brought
it
in
a
large
wooden
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
sitz
bath
how
that
poor
woman
carried
it
we
know
not
it
occupied
half
the
table
and
was
so
scrupulously
clean
that
we
feared
to
touch
it
with
our
sordid
hands
john
and
esau
at
last
attacked
it
in
the
orthodox
manner
which
is
to
sit
on
opposite
sides
of
the
table
and
to
draw
a
line
across
the
surface
of
the
milk
with
a
spoon
before
beginning
and
then
to
eat
fair
up
to
that
line
it
would
have
amused
some
of
our
friends
at
home
if
they
could
have
seen
these
two
young
men
of
fashion
at
the
moment
when
both
of
them
were
engaged
with
abnormally
large
wooden
spoons
silently
ladling
down
tuk
melk
out
of
a
tub
as
big
as
a
table
they
reported
that
it
was
on
the
whole
good
something
like
curds
but
with
a
sourer
taste
and
it
was
much
improved
by
sugar
but
though
they
ate
a
large
quantity
of
it
being
men
of
great
courage
and
determination
they
could
not
persuade
the
skipper
to
risk
his
life
in
experiments
with
untried
articles
of
food
he
however
gave
utterance
to
the
following
refined
expression
of
his
sentiments
i
wouldn
t
touch
that
beastliness
if
you
gave
me
fourteen
pence
a
spoonful
to
swallow
no
one
offered
the
reward
out
shooting
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
we
put
up
a
snipe
just
at
evening
which
went
down
again
close
to
us
this
species
of
game
is
not
common
up
here
although
we
find
his
cousin
the
woodcock
fairly
often
consequently
we
were
much
excited
and
advanced
upon
the
foe
with
insidious
step
and
bloodthirsty
weapons
almost
at
our
shoulders
in
order
to
slay
him
as
soon
as
he
should
rise
all
went
well
and
at
the
right
moment
up
he
got
and
promptly
did
the
skipper
fire
and
miss
him
while
esau
s
gun
for
the
first
time
on
record
missed
fire
and
left
him
using
language
that
ought
to
have
ignited
any
cartridge
so
the
happy
bird
zigzagged
off
into
the
dim
shades
of
sheltering
night
and
we
went
on
our
way
full
of
thought
and
sorrow
arriving
again
at
the
sæter
after
narrowly
escaping
shipwreck
in
the
passage
we
found
that
jens
had
come
to
meet
us
and
as
he
will
enter
our
service
from
this
date
we
shall
no
longer
need
ivar
and
paid
him
off
arranging
however
that
he
is
to
come
to
help
us
home
when
we
leave
rus
vand
we
like
ivar
very
much
now
though
we
did
not
by
any
means
dote
upon
him
at
first
ivar
is
a
good
fellow
but
an
idiot
perfectly
willing
to
do
anything
in
the
world
but
not
understanding
to
do
anything
his
budding
reputation
was
blasted
in
our
eyes
the
first
time
that
we
left
camp
and
entrusted
everything
to
his
care
we
were
away
for
three
days
and
in
that
time
he
consumed
nearly
four
pounds
of
our
best
butter
on
our
return
we
decided
that
he
was
a
knave
but
we
have
since
learnt
that
it
was
only
his
natural
impulsiveness
that
led
him
to
commit
such
an
outrage
and
now
that
we
have
found
how
eager
he
is
to
oblige
us
in
everything
we
like
his
strange
nature
better
than
öla
s
awful
laziness
of
character
he
came
into
the
room
this
morning
to
stand
for
his
portrait
and
the
easy
graceful
attitude
that
he
assumed
for
the
occasion
was
inimitable
his
waistcoat
and
boots
were
perhaps
his
greatest
charm
but
his
open
countenance
and
genial
smile
six
inches
in
diameter
played
no
small
part
in
causing
him
to
become
beloved
by
us
as
he
was
ivar
always
laughed
like
a
nigger
on
a
racecourse
and
whenever
we
took
him
out
he
was
exactly
like
an
unbroken
retriever
if
a
bird
was
killed
he
rush
in
to
gather
it
and
we
had
to
shout
back
ivar
back
lie
down
down
charge
to
prevent
him
disturbing
any
birds
that
might
have
chanced
to
remain
during
the
yells
and
convulsions
of
christy
minstrel
mirth
into
which
the
death
of
a
ryper
always
sent
him
his
behaviour
usually
made
us
laugh
so
much
that
we
attributed
any
missing
to
the
unsteadiness
caused
by
constant
hilarity
we
gave
him
our
spade
as
a
parting
present
and
dismissed
him
with
our
blessing

have

stiff
climb
up
by
the
side
of
the
torrent

comes
gadareneing
down
from

above
our

presently
we
stand
on

the

extremely
for

fight
our

across

must
pause

say
nay
what
a
glorious
sight
straight
in

the
peak
of

all
glistening
white
with
newly

footnote
gadareneing
rushing
violently
down
a
steep
place
such
was
the
scene
lying
before
us
on
the
north
side
of
the
mountain
grand
beyond
description
perhaps
the
finest
in
norway
but
not
exactly
inviting
to
shivering
hungry
mortals
so
not
much
time
was
spent
on
it
down
we
went
with
the
wind
worse
than
on
the
other
side
howling
past
our
ears
and
screeching
in
the
and
at
last
arrived
at
the
lake
to
find
jens
hauling
for
his
life
at
the
boat
which
though
filled
with
water
by
the
breakers
had
fortunately
not
been
battered
to
pieces
on
the
rocky
strand
he
had
left
it
dragged
up
on
the
beach
out
of
the
water
but
the
sea
had
increased
so
much
in
his
absence
that
if
we
had
been
a
little
later
it
would
without
doubt
have
been
smashed
however
we
soon
baled
her
out
and
with
öla
as

commenced
the
passage
rusvasoset
as
the
outlet
is
called
is
not
more
than
yards
across
but
the
waves
had
had
seven
miles
of
very
open
water
to
get
up
in
and
they
came
rolling
down
to
this
end
in
a
very
alarming
manner
with
great
difficulty
we
shoved
off
and
then
with
öla
sculling
his
hardest
and
the
skipper
keeping
our
head
to
wind
we
at
last
got
safe
across
with
no
mishap
but
the
loss
of
öla
s
hat
and
a
thorough
ducking
for
all
of
us
illustration
a
stormy
crossing
at
rusvasoset
öla
was
very
sorrowful
about
his
hat
which
was
of
pure
leghorn
straw
double
seamed
extra
quality
lining
and
being
further
embellished
with
a
black
braid
ribbon
it
was
a
great
source
of
pride
to
him
but
we
mocked
when
it
flew
away
and
are
inclined
to
bear
its
departure
with
equanimity
and
hope
it
will
be
accepted
as
a
propitiatory
offering
by
the
angry
lady
of
the
lake
all
the
things
were
at
last
safely
housed
and
we
soon
made
ourselves
comfortable
in
our
new
abode
which
is
luxury
itself
in
this
weather
when
compared
with
a
tent
there
are
two
huts
one
by
the
edge
of
the
lake
the
other
about
yards
away
and
it
is
the
latter
which
we
occupy
we
enter
by
a
door
about
five
feet
high
invariably
knocking
our
heads
against
the
lintel
and
swearing
as
we
do
so
the
first
room
is
about
nine
feet
square
with
a
narrow
dresser
under
the
solitary
window
on
the
left
and
an
iron
cooking
stove
in
the
nearest
corner
to
the
right
the
more
remote
one
being
tenanted
by
a
bed
round
the
room
at
various
heights
are
shelves
and
hooks
adorned
by
cooking
utensils
of
all
kinds
very
kindly
left
for
us
by
their
worthy
owners
two
or
three
stools
complete
the
furniture
and
on
the
floor
are
to
be
seen
carved
the
effigies
of
departed
trout
of
fabulous
weight
with
dates
and
the
initials
of
their
captors
passing
on
through
a
still
smaller
doorway
we
find
ourselves
in
another
room
of
the
same
size
but
with
three
beds
instead
of
one
and
an
open
norwegian
fireplace
the
same
kind
of
pegs
and
shelves
and
hooks
for
guns
on
the
wall
more
profile
fishes
and
walls
covered
with
records
in
pencil
of
game
killed
by
former
inhabitants
with
occasional
amusing
notes
this
is
our
dining
drawing
and
bed
room
the
other
is
only
used
as
kitchen
the
men
s
hut
near
the
water
is
also
divided
into
two
rooms
the
outer
and
much
larger
compartment
is
used
as
a
cellar
larder
and
general
and
presents
to
say
the
least
of
it
a
somewhat
untidy
appearance
as
bottles
barrels
and
boards
a
grindstone
reindeer
bones
a
saw
a
and
old
nets
are
piled
together
without
any
attempt
at
order
the
inner
room
is
very
small
about
nine
feet
by
four
and
there
our
two
men
sleep
and
there
also
is
a
large
oven
built
of
stone
and
heated
by
a
fire
inside
it
as
we
had
no
bread
we
proceeded
to
bake
and
our
ignorance
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
this
oven
caused
the
bread
to
have
a
terribly
trying
time
of
it
for
we
did
not
make
it
hot
enough
at
the
first
attempt
and
the
bread
was
left
lying
on
the
top
covered
by
a
cloth
for
over
an
hour
while
the
oven
was
being
heated
a
second
time
all
s
well
that
ends
well
and
this
batch
of
rolls
turned
out
the
very
best
that
frail
man
ever
tasted
and
consequently
at
supper
we
ate
enough
bread
and
butter
and
jam
to
supply
a
school
feast
of
the
hungriest
description
while
the
skipper
and
john
attended
to
the
loaves
esau
looked
after
the
fishes
and
very
soon
got
a
nice
dish
of
in
the
river
as
he
came
back
something
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
caught
his
eye
it
is
yet
it
can
t
be
yes
by
george
it
is
öla
s
hat
wedged
in
between
two
rocks
and
slightly
out
of
shape
but
with
the
extra
quality
lining
uninjured
and
the
pure
leghorn
straw
in
very
fair
condition
the
effusion
with
which
öla
received
it
was
a
sight
to
be
seen
but
no
one
else
exhibited
much
enthusiasm
an
inventory
of
our
remaining
stores
reveals
the
fact
that
we
have
heaps
of
everything
except
coffee
and
bacon
which
can
only
last
about
a
week
longer
in
view
of
this
happy
state
of
things
the
skipper
proposed
to
spend
a
week
of
wild
and
reckless
profusion
and
sinful
extravagance
esau
at
once
pictured
himself
seated
on
a
grassy
slope
giving
way
to
epicurean
indulgence
surrounded
by
three
untouched
pots
of
jam
and
eating
from
a
fourth
with
a
at
his
side
a
cup
of
tea
blacker
than
ink
and
flavoured
with
condensed
milk
thicker
than
cream
while
he
flipped
lumps
of
sugar
into
the
water
instead
of
pebbles
and
commanded
öla
to
sand
the
floor
of
the
hut
with
pepper
john
suggested
as
an
amendment
that
we
should
make
some
exception
to
show
that
we
possess
the
power
of
let
us
said
he
deny
ourselves
in
some
one
thing
not
in
luxuries
which
are
getting
scarce
in
that
there
would
be
no
merit
no
rather
let
us
exercise
our
virtue
in
respect
of
what
we
have
in
the
greatest
abundance
and
thereby
show
a
great
and
shining
example
to
the
world
let
us
abstain
entirely
from
he
had
ascertained
that
there
was
plenty
of
whisky
esau
rose
to
oppose
the
remarks
of
the
honourable
gentleman
such
would
be
a
good
action
but
the
constant
performance
of
virtuous
actions
tends
to
make
one
haughty
i
dare
say
you
fellows
don
t
know
this
but
i
do
because
i
ve
tried
it
i
prefer
to
be
wicked
and
the
motion
was
not
pressed
to
a
division
we
are
well
provided
with
all
kinds
of
food
for
we
found
in
the
larder
a
shoulder
of
venison
and
we
have
any
amount
of
ryper
which
as
john
says
will
save
our
bacon
though
they
could
not
save
their
own
and
so
with
a
comfortable
hut
to
live
in
a
river
full
of
fish
at
our
door
and
a
blazing
fire
to
sit
round
life
assumes
a
rosy
hue
and
we
go
to
sleep
in
real
beds
with
bright
hopes
of
the
future
the
skipper
was
heard
to
murmur
as
he
turned
over
to
sleep
i
say
what
bread
that
is
when
i
get
home
i
shall
publish
a
pamphlet
and
teach
all
the
world
to
bake
like
it
is
rather
rough
on
the
skipper
s
pamphlet
to
publish
his
recipe
here
but
this
is
copied
from
his
journal
take
dough
in
large
quantities
and
place
it
on
a
tin
heat
the
oven
till
you
are
sick
to
death
of
piling
on
wood
smoke
a
pipe
and
remove
the
ashes
place
the
dough
in
the
oven
and
leave
home
for
an
indefinite
period
if
you
ever
return
remove
the
decomposed
particles
and
let
them
get
warm
in
the
sun
or
else
freeze
in
the
snow
it
really
don
t
matter
a
bit
now
heat
the
oven
and
recommit
them
brood
over
the
oven
exhibiting
the
tenderest
solicitude
they
will
soon
be
done
and
perhaps
will
be
good
perhaps
not
nobody
can
last
night
was
very
cold
and
this
morning
there
was
ice
on
the
lake
and
the
in
the
boat
was
frozen
solid
esau
and
jens
went
up
the
lake
in
the
boat
to
stalk
and
the
skipper
accompanied
them
to
fish
while
john
fished
nearer
home
about
six
o
clock
the
boat
was
seen
returning
loaded
with
the
head
and
skin
of
a
very
fine
buck
and
esau
gave
us
his
history
thus
as
soon
as
we
landed
halfway
up
the
lake
we
found
the
spoor
of
two
very
large
bucks
and
a
smaller
one
which
had
swum
across
the
lake
in
the
night
they
seemed
to
have
gone
towards
the
tyknings
glacier
so
we
went
in
that
direction
also
the
wind
was
as
bad
as
it
could
be
in
that
valley
for
we
were
obliged
to
walk
exactly
with
it
at
first
instead
of
against
it
in
order
to
get
round
a
sufficiently
large
piece
of
country
and
then
work
back
against
the
wind
we
walked
a
couple
of
miles
without
seeing
anything
and
at
last
got
close
to
the
tyknings
glacier
and
the
iceberg
lake
at
its
foot
you
know
that
lake
well
enough
skipper
full
of
lumps
of
ice
some
of
them
as
big
as
this
hut
which
keep
breaking
off
from
the
projecting
glacier
as
it
slides
down
and
i
dare
say
you
remember
what
an
awful
deathly
stillness
reigns
there
and
what
a
dismal
sight
the
lake
is
cold
and
black
under
the
shade
of
the
crags
which
close
in
its
sides
well
we
sat
down
there
and
used
the
glasses
for
a
long
time
what
do
you
mean
by
using
the
glasses
interrupted
john
drinking
whisky
and
water
esau
withered
him
with
a
look
and
went
on
well
spied
if
you
like
spied
for
a
long
time
without
seeing
anything
and
we
had
just
walked
on
again
a
few
yards
when
the
silence
was
suddenly
broken
by
a
cry
from
jens
of
reins
and
there
yards
in
front
of
us
was
a
noble
buck
which
had
evidently
been
concealed
from
our
view
by
some
rocks
and
had
now
smelt
us
and
was
departing
at
a
stately
trot
apparently
despising
undignified
hurry
i
fancy
his
intention
was
to
trot
away
at
that
long
swinging
pace
and
get
into
asiatic
russia
in
time
for
tea
so
i
grabbed
the
rifle
from
jens
as
of
course
now
that
he
was
alarmed
a
long
shot
was
our
only
chance
sat
down
on
a
stone
and
with
the
faintest
hopes
of
hitting
him
fired
twice
and
of
course
missed
now
here
was
where
my
luck
came
in
if
that
buck
had
not
been
so
proud
he
could
have
run
straight
away
from
us
to
the
glacier
beyond
the
lake
but
we
were
betwixt
the
wind
and
his
nobility
and
he
wanted
to
get
a
clean
breeze
and
run
against
it
instead
of
down
it
consequently
when
he
was
about
yards
away
he
turned
to
the
right
apparently
intending
to
make
a
circle
round
us
and
so
get
the
wind
in
his
face
directly
he
turned
broadside
to
us
jens
gave
a
shrill
whistle
and
the
buck
stopped
short
for
a
moment
so
that
i
had
just
time
to
make
a
careful
shot
and
the
bullet
hit
him
in
the
ribs
at
the
shot
he
stumbled
but
recovered
himself
instantly
and
made
off
a
good
deal
faster
than
before
evidently
perceiving
that
things
were
getting
serious
and
that
this
here
warn
t
no
child
s
before
i
could
fire
again
he
got
into
the
ravine
which
runs
down
towards
rus
lake
and
was
out
of
our
sight
we
thought
there
was
just
a
chance
of
cutting
him
off
in
that
extremely
rough
ground
though
of
course
we
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
much
hurt
or
not
so
we
ran
as
hard
as
we
could
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
loading
as
we
ran
suddenly
i
caught
sight
of
him
going
very
slowly
but
luckily
he
did
not
see
us
so
we
dodged
into
a
little
gully
and
after
another
short
run
came
in
sight
of
him
standing
still
no
doubt
owing
to
his
wound
and
about
yards
away
this
time
he
saw
us
and
darted
off
as
fleetly
as
ever
no
longer
with
his
side
to
us
but
straight
away
i
was
dead
beat
and
jens
had
thrown
himself
down
and
was
panting
like
like
a
concertina
suggested
the
skipper
plate
death
of
the
stor
bock
at
the
iceberg
lake
tyknings
hö
yes
just
so
anyhow
we
could
not
run
another
yard
you
know
what
it
is
on
those
stones
so
i
sat
down
again
and
with
the
rifle
going
like
a
fired
and
by
the
greatest
luck
hit
him
close
to
the
tail
and
the
bullet
went
clean
through
his
body
and
smashed
his
shoulder
down
he
went
and
we
raised
a
yell
of
triumph
whereupon
he
jumped
up
again
and
went
off
at
a
slapping
pace
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
i
believe
if
he
could
have
reached
the
snow
he
would
have
done
us
even
now
but
we
were
between
him
and
the
glacier
and
he
had
nothing
but
rocks
to
go
on
bad
enough
for
a
deer
with
the
proper
complement
of
legs
and
ribs
and
very
trying
indeed
to
one
crippled
like
this
i
m
sure
however
he
kept
going
at
a
great
pace
for
a
few
hundred
yards
and
we
lay
in
a
state
of
exhaustion
and
watched
him
through
the
glass
soon
he
began
to
move
more
slowly
and
then
to
go
round
and
round
in
a
small
circle
and
at
last
he
lay
down
by
that
time
i
had
partially
recovered
my
wind
so
i
stalked
him
with
great
care
and
got
within
a
hundred
yards
of
him
took
a
steady
aim
for
his
heart
and
pulled
to
my
horror
he
bounced
up
again
and
ran
like
a
hare
for
a
dozen
yards
and
then
rolled
over
and
over
as
dead
as
julius
cæsar
how
jens
and
i
whooped
and
shook
hands
and
laughed
can
be
imagined
by
any
one
who
has
seen
a
grand
deer
almost
escape
him
and
then
by
a
bit
of
luck
and
a
breakneck
run
just
nailed
him
when
the
chance
seemed
hopeless
after
that
we
lay
on
our
backs
and
panted
for
some
time
but
after
finishing
the
whisky
and
a
large
portion
of
the
iceberg
lake
we
recovered
sufficiently
to
skin
our
prize
and
cut
him
up
he
is
a
most
splendidly
fat
stor
bock
jens
says
by
far
the
best
that
has
been
killed
in
these
parts
this
year
a
beautiful
skin
and
best
luck
of
all
his
horns
have
got
rid
of
the
velvet
and
are
fit
to
take
home
and
they
have
fourteen
points
i
measured
the
fat
on
his
loins
and
it
was
two
and
a
half
inches
thick
jens
tried
to
bring
home
a
hind
quarter
as
well
as
the
head
and
skin
but
before
he
had
gone
twenty
yards
he
found
that
it
was
too
much
for
him
so
turned
back
and
buried
it
with
the
at
this
time
of
year
the
biggest
bucks
of
a
herd
seem
to
separate
themselves
from
the
rest
and
roam
about
either
alone
or
perhaps
a
couple
together
we
think
they
act
wisely
in
this
respect
as
the
calves
are
now
old
enough
to
run
as
fast
as
their
mothers
in
case
of
danger
and
do
not
need
any
paternal
protection
and
the
bucks
would
no
doubt
become
horribly
bored
if
they
remained
with
their
wives
and
children
all
the
year
round
whereas
by
this
system
they
are
quite
independent
for
a
time
and
roam
all
over
the
country
seeing
a
lot
of
life
and
living
uncommonly
well
very
much
like
a
married
man
when
he
gets
away
on
board
a
friend
s
yacht
for
a
couple
of
months
and
comes
back
quite
brightened
up
at
the
end
of
his
trip
and
positively
agreeable
and
to
his
wife
and
family
insomuch
that
they
are
right
glad
to
see
him
home
again
of
course
the
stalker
s
great
object
in
life
is
to
shoot
one
of
these
big
bucks
but
it
is
a
desire
seldom
realised
as
they
are
very
restless
and
only
haunt
the
most
secluded
and
difficult
country
we
have
only
met
with
two
others
in
this
expedition
and
those
the
skipper
saw
retiring
at
a
good
swinging
trot
over
the
heights
of
memurutungen
we
have
obtained
some
interesting
information
from
jens
about
the
horns
of
the
reindeer
as
every
one
knows
both
the
bucks
and
does
have
horns
but
they
shed
them
at
different
times
those
of
the
does
and
smaller
bucks
are
now
in
velvet
and
will
not
get
properly
hard
until
october
they
will
then
remain
on
all
through
the
winter
and
be
shed
in
the
spring
but
the
large
bucks
have
their
horns
hard
now
and
will
shed
them
in
the
winter
and
so
be
defenceless
during
the
time
when
the
snow
lies
thickest
all
this
is
undoubtedly
true
for
jens
is
thoroughly
trustworthy
in
his
facts
but
what
is
the
reason
jens
does
not
know
but
he
gives
us
another
fact
in
the
winter
when
the
stor
bocks
have
no
horns
the
snow
is
often
so
deep
that
only
the
strongest
deer
can
scrape
it
away
to
lay
bare
the
moss
which
at
that
season
forms
their
food
then
come
the
does
and
smaller
bucks
and
with
their
horns
push
away
the
unfortunate
big
ones
and
so
are
saved
from
starvation
while
the
stor
bocks
have
to
work
double
tides
in
order
to
get
anything
to
eat
we
present
this
fact
in
all
humility
to
darwin
as
a
solution
of
the
problem
why
has
the
female
reindeer
horns
evidently
they
originally
had
none
but
by
constant
pushing
at
their
lords
and
masters
they
developed
them
by
degrees
then
by
the
survival
of
the
fittest
those
does
with
the
longest
and
sharpest
horns
prospered
most
and
soon
there
were
none
of
the
hornless
does
left
and
all
calves
began
to
have
horns
as
a
matter
of
course
esau
is
inclined
to
the
belief
that
by
the
same
line
of
reasoning
the
big
bucks
constantly
being
shot
at
through
untold
ages
have
developed
ribs
and
that
that
is
the
reason
why
they
take
such
a
lot
of
killing
possibly
we
have
worked
the
theory
in
the
wrong
direction
it
may
be
that
originally
all
deer
of
every
kind
had
horns
and
the
reindeer
doe
is
the
only
female
which
now
keeps
them
because
she
alone
has
to
fight
for
her
living
but
the
snow
and
the
horns
together
are
cause
and
effect
of
that
we
are
convinced
the
de
at
dinner
was
a
ryper
curry
executed
in
the
skipper
s
best
manner
and
worthy
of
a
place
amongst
the
old
masters
though
providentially
none
of
them
were
here
to
help
us
with
it
john
also
contributed
his
share
to
the
menu
a
pudding
which
when
it
came
to
table
looked
a
trifle
doughy
at
the
ends
as
even
the
best
of
such
puddings
generally
do
john
turned
to
esau
and
in
his
sweetest
manner
said
do
you
like
end
old
fellow
he
a
little
astonished
at
this
unwonted
politeness
replied
with
equal
courtesy
no
thank
you
i
don
t
think
i
care
about
ah
said
john
well
the
skipper
and
i
and
thereupon
cut
the
pudding
into
two
portions
and
was
giving
one
to
the
skipper
and
the
other
to
himself
when
the
proceedings
were
interrupted
by
a
brief
but
energetic
scene
of
riot
and
bloodshed
which
was
terminated
by
a
treaty
of
peace
on
the
basis
of
the
as
regards
the
pudding
and
subsequent
of
the
same
into
three
parts
by
a
mixed
commission
among
the
fish
brought
in
was
one
enormously
long
brute
which
ought
to
have
weighed
five
pounds
but
was
only
three
pounds
the
skipper
captured
this
prize
at
the
outlet
of
the
lake
which
seems
to
be
a
favourite
place
for
sick
and
dying
fish
like
this
matters
of
food
are
generally
referred
to
esau
because
he
cares
more
about
eating
than
the
other
two
as
say
or
because
he
has
got
more
sense
than
they
have
as
says
the
two
explanations
are
probably
identical
when
this
fish
was
brought
to
him
for
judgment
he
promptly
said
give
it
to
the
the
skipper
replied
my
dear
chap
whenever
we
collect
any
kind
of
food
that
isn
t
quite
nice
you
always
give
it
to
the
esau
became
grave
at
once
and
answered
you
forget
we
are
not
in
england
at
home
truly
we
give
the
best
of
everything
to
our
servants
and
are
thankful
for
the
worst
ourselves
but
norway
is
a
country
where
the
canker
of
civilisation
has
not
yet
crept
in
to
taint
everything
it
passes
over
and
where
the
noisome
worm
of
increasing
independence
does
not
blossom
in
the
heart
of
every
tree
our
men
would
be
proud
and
happy
to
chew
this
aged
fish
and
we
have
had
instances
to
convince
us
that
they
would
be
prouder
and
happier
if
the
aged

were

great
sorrow
this
morning
at
breakfast
by
announcing
his
intention
of
leaving
rus
lake
on
the
day
after
which
ought
to
be
a
sunday
according
to
our
reckoning
it
seems
that
his
conscience
upbraids
him
for
leaving
a
brother
to
be
married
without
his
assistance
and
the
house
has
sadly
approved
his
decision
while
esau
was
having
a
great
day
with
the
trout
in
the
river
the
skipper
went
after
deer
and
came
back
cursing
fortune
and
all
her
emissaries
and
signs
which
means
ravens
horseshoes
spiders
and
so
forth
a
few
days
ago
when
he
was
starting
on
a
stalk
he
heard
a
raven
croaking
overhead
so
refrained
from
looking
up
lest
he
should
catch
its
eye
and
have
bad
luck
but
that
raven
was
not
to
be
balked
of
his
victim
and
obtruded
himself
so
that
the
skipper
to
see
him
and
of
course
no
deer
came
that
day
the
next
day
ravens
crossed
his
path
both
cawing
in
the
loudest
and
most
jubilant
manner
so
he
was
greatly
delighted
thinking
that
this
was
a
sure
precursor
of
good
sport
but
something
was
wrong
and
again
no
deer
resulted
but
two
ravens
came
and
cawed
in
a
gentle
soothing
confident
manner
just
outside
the
window
before
we
got
up
this
gave
the
skipper
great
belief
in
the
turn
of
luck
and
he
started
with
a
rope
in
his
pocket
to
tie
up
the
deerskins
withal
his
knife
sharpened
like
a
razor
and
his
bag
full
of
cartridges
once
again
he
saw
nothing
and
was
nearly
withered
away
by
the
cold
wind
and
rain
coming
home
he
picked
up
a
horseshoe
probably
the
only
one
in
the
jotunfjeld
but
the
times
are
out
of
joint
and
these
barometers
of
fortune
have
become
depressed
by
the
prevailing
bad
seasons
and
the
state
of
the
weather
so
that
they
can
not
be
depended
on
in
spite
of
the
absence
of
sport
he
came
back
raving
about
the
glorious
views
of
the
mountains
which
quite
repay
any
one
for
a
long
walk
now
that
they
are
newly
covered
with
snow
from
nautgardstind
looking
northwards
away
from
the
glaciers

splendid
panorama
is
spread
out

and

lighted
up
by
the
bright
gleams
of
the
september

shining
out
bravely

intervals

winter

begun

the
hilly
woodland
country
through
which
we
journeyed
on
our
way

and
on
the
left
a
vast
plain
of
rolling
ground
far
beyond
this
rises
a
towering
cluster
of
mountains
over
whose
heads
float
bands
of
fleecy
clouds
while
up
their
sides
the
drift
and
seem
to
nestle
in
sleep
they
say
these
peaks
are
called
ronderne
but
surely
when
seen
on
such
a
day
a
dream
of
heaven
is
a
better
name
for
where
else
on
earth
can
man
be
so
near
heaven
as
in
a
lofty
solitude
like
this
where
he
can
gaze
his
fill
on
nature
s
most
beautiful
loneliness
untouched
and
undisturbed
by
human
hand
öla
s
ignorance
of
english
enables
one
to
gloat
in
silence
over
such
a
scene
without
any
danger
of
being
rudely
recalled
to
earth
by
a
jarring
exclamation
of

illustration
gloptind
rock
at
the
western
end
of
rus
lake
the
skipper
made
a
last
stalk
with
his
usual
luck
not
seeing
even
a
track
though
he
went
into
ground
that
we
always
considered
a
sure
find
near
the
west
end
of
the
lake
near
there
and
under
the
shelter
of
the
curious
rock
called
gloptind
there
is
a
little
ruined
hut
which
was
built
by
a
former
occupier
of
rus
vand
for
greater
convenience
in
shooting
near
that
part
of
the
ground
when
we
were
here
before
esau
was
obliged
to
go
home
prematurely
and
the
skipper
and
jens
went
to
stay
in
this
den
after
his
departure
and
got
several
deer
while
there
this
evening
we
persuaded
the
skipper
to
tell
us
all
about
it
and
after
he
had
put
himself
in
what
he
considered
a
comfortable
attitude
on
the
bed
and
lighted
his
pipe
he
began
well
when
esau
went
home
jens
and
i
were
left
up
here
and
got
on
very
comfortably
considering
the
disadvantages
under
which
the
human
race
has
laboured
ever
since
that
unlucky
business
of
the
tower
of
what
he
mean
whispered
john
anxiously
to
esau
how
should
know
replied
the
latter
just
listen
a
bit
longer
and
i
dare
say
we
shall
find
the
skipper
went
on
we
went
out
several
days
and
walked
enormous
distances
without
seeing
any
deer
so
one
day
we
decided
to
put
a
frying
pan
some
firewood
and
a
change
of
clothes
into
the
boat
and
row
up
to
that
little
tumbledown
stone
hut
at
the
other
end
for
a
night
or
two
as
it
is
in
the
heart
of
the
most
unfrequented
country
and
there
is
nothing
near
to
scare
the
most
timid
deer
we
packed
everything
into
the
boat
and
rowed
off
one
fine
morning
the
clouds
however
beginning
to
hang
ominously
over
the
distant
mountains
jens
rowed
slowly
so
that
i
could
fish
on
the
way
and
our
progress
was
further
delayed
by
a
very
soon
the
clouds
closed
in
all
round
and
the
sky
got
very
dark
jens
kept
rowing
on
steadily
from
time
to
time
looking
up
at
the
high
mountain
ridges
that
wall
in
the
west
end
of
the
lake
while
i
devoted
my
attention
to
whipping
the
water
from
the
stern
hoping
to
entice
some
unwary
fish
before
the
approaching
rain
should
stop
our
chance
of
getting
some
fresh
food
suddenly
he
stopped
rowing
and
uttering
the
magic
word
reins
pointed
up
to
an
apparently
deserted
mountain
slope
on
the
bes
hö
side
and
handed
me
the
glass
by
the
aid
of
which
i
soon
discovered
two
reindeer
bucks
feeding
about
a
mile
away
and
almost
straight
above
us
i
had
on
a
blue
serge
suit
so
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
change
to
my
stalking
suit
then
and
there
in
the
boat
meanwhile
the
threatened
rain
began
to
descend
in
torrents
and
the
wind
swept
by
in
such
squalls
that
jens
had
to
work
hard
to
keep
the
boat
in
her
place
at
last
the
change
was
completed
the
serge
suit
stowed
away
under
a
mackintosh
and
we
got
to
shore
and
began
our
stalk
it
was
a
difficult
task
to
keep
out
of
sight
while
advancing
and
we
could
only
move
at
intervals
when
the
deer
shifted
for
a
few
moments
behind
a
rock
or
into
a
hollow
in
their
search
for
food
so
that
we
had
first
to
run
when
opportunity
offered
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
over
very
bad
ground
then
crawl
another
quarter
over
more
broken
ground
and
at
length
after
an
hour
of
this
being
pretty
close
to
the
deer
they
happened
to
come
more
into
view
and
we
had
to
lie
prone
on
our
bellies
for
nearly
twenty
minutes
while
they
fed
their
way
into
the
next
hollow
and
the
heavy
rain
pelted
down
on
us
till
we
were
soaked
sodden
and
nearly
perished
with
cold
i
thought
that
time
of
cramped
penance
would
never
end
but
at
last
the
hindermost
buck
got
his
head
safe
behind
a
welcome
ridge
and
then
we
were
soon
up
and
after
here
the
skipper
stopped
to
strike
a
match
on
his
trousers
and
relight
his
pipe
and
then
resumed
now
we
knew
we
must
be
close
to
them
and
with
rifles
cocked
and
hearts
beating
uncomfortably
advanced
expectant
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
after
esau
went
home
i
allowed
jens
to
take
his
rifle
out
he
was
so
desperately
keen
about
it
suddenly
we
came
on
the
bucks
only
forty
yards
away
conscious
of
danger
but
not
knowing
what
they
feared
too
unsettled
to
feed
too
uncertain
to
move
plate
good
sport
bad
weather
the
skipper
s
two
stor
i
fired
first
and
immediately
afterwards
as
jens
fired
and
both
deer
bounded
into
the
air
and
disappeared
like
lightning
over
a
ridge
beyond
them
we
followed
at
our
best
pace
i
cramming
in
a
couple
of
cartridges
as
we
ran
and
saw
them
again
directly
still
running
and
a
good
deal
further
away
i
fired
two
more
shots
and
one
buck
fell
dead
at
once
while
the
other
galloped
on
about
twenty
yards
further
and
then
suddenly
stumbled
and
fell
head
over
heels
i
fancy
that
our
first
shots
killed
them
and
that
one
was
really
killed
by
jens
but
may
i
never
know
for
certain
the
yell
that
we
gave
when
we
saw
them
both
lying
dead
woke
the
echoes
of
that
dreary
solitude
and
must
have
been
worth
hearing
by
any
student
of
human
nature
in
a
wild
shout
of
triumph
there
is
only
one
language
for
all
nations
and
jens
and
i
joined
our
voices
in
the
same
glorious
tongue
for
once
both
these
deer
were
stor
bocks
six
years
old
and
fat
we
skinned
them
there
and
leaving
the
bodies
as
usual
safe
under
stones
returned
to
the
boat
with
the
heads
and
skins
by
the
way
john
you
must
have
seen
the
horns
of
these
two
deer
on
the
wall
of
besse
sæter
for
i
had
no
means
of
getting
them
home
and
jens
put
them
up
there
the
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
when
we
reached
the
little
stone
hut
which
was
to
be
our
lodging
its
roof
was
full
of
holes
and
let
the
rain
through
like
a
sieve
but
we
stretched
the
two
deerskins
over
it
and
so
made
it
habitable
for
a
time
inside
there
is
as
you
know
only
just
room
for
two
men
to
lie
side
by
side
touching
each
other
and
here
after
a
liberal
meal
and
a
contemplative
pipe
we
turned
in
and
slept
like
honest
men
next
morning
after
breakfast
while
i
was
making
up
a
fresh
cast
for
my
rod
i
saw
a
man
approaching
the
hut
as
this
was
the
only
intrusion
from
human
beings
that
we
had
suffered
for
more
than
a
month
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
where
the
deuce
could
a
man
come
from
and
what
the
dickens
could
he
want
it
soon
proved
to
be
old
tronhūus
with
a
note
for
jens
illustration
the
old
stone
hut
near
gloptind
i
must
explain
that
besse
sæter
where
jens
lives
belongs
to
a
man
who
comes
from
christiania
and
jens
is
only
his
tenant
there
this
man
had
arrived
at
his
sæter
two
days
before
this
with
a
young
english
nobleman
whom
he
was
proud
to
have
as
his
guest
and
to
whom
he
naturally
wished
to
show
some
sport
but
he
had
been
unable
to
do
so
for
want
of
a
good
stalker
this
was
of
course
very
unfortunate
for
him
and
his
guest
but
it
by
no
means
justified
his
present
conduct
he
had
addressed
a
letter
to
jens
but
written
it
in
english
so
that
i
should
read
it
sending
merely
a
verbal
message
to
jens
by
his
father
to
ensure
our
both
knowing
the
purport
of
the
letter
which
was
to
the
following
effect
jens
if
you
do
not
return
with
the
bearer
of
this
letter
to
besse
sæter
to
show
myself
and
lord
some
deer
you
will
at
once
lose
your
tenancy
of
besse
i
could
not
keep
jens
and
thus
cause
him
to
be
unfairly
ejected
from
his
home
so
having
no
paper
with
me
i
wrote
in
pencil
on
the
back
of
the
note
that
peter
had
brought
as
you
must
be
aware
that
jens
is
acting
as
my
servant
this
summer
and
that
by
calling
him
away
you
leave
me
absolutely
alone
at
the
stone
hut
on
rus
vand
i
hope
that
you
will
not
detain
him
after
receiving
this
with
this
missive
jens
departed
and
soon
old
peter
followed
him
and
left
me
like
robinson
crusoe
alone
on
my
desert
highland
i
am
bound
to
say
that
i
felt
inclined
to
inquire
with
selkirk
o
solitude
where
are
the
charms
as
i
turned
to
perform
the
duties
of
the
day
absolutely
deserted
in
that
desolate
spot
with
no
companions
but
the
lake
and
solemn
mountain
heights
around
me
so
after
a
short
time
i
put
the
lares
and
penates
hollo
what
s
that
broke
in
esau
you
never
said
anything
about
bringing
that
with
you
you
duffer
said
the
skipper
it
s
norwegian
for
the
and
do
you
mean
to
say
you
ve
been
all
this
time
in
the
country
without
learning
that
oh
all
right
grunted
esau
go
well
i
put
them
into
the
boat
and
sculled
the
seven
miles
back
to
this
hut
as
i
did
not
feel
inclined
to
remain
alone
in
that
little
stone
hutch
for
the
night
three
days
passed
before
they
let
jens
return
to
me
and
during
that
time
i
was
certainly
rather
dull
and
at
night
felt
a
trifle
creepy
but
the
days
did
not
pass
as
slowly
as
you
might
have
imagined
for
being
without
assistance
my
time
was
fully
occupied
in
catching
my
daily
supply
of
fish
chopping
firewood
cooking
washing
and
so
on
at
night
the
wind
howled
dismally
round
the
cabin
walls
but
after
the
hard
work
of
the
day
i
soon
fell
asleep
and
at
last
began
almost
to
like
the
solitary
life
still
i
longed
for
jens
to
come
back
as
i
could
not
go
out
stalking
alone
the
season
was
far
advanced
and
the
weather
very
cold
how
i
cursed
that
englishman
gentle
murmurs
of
bet
you
did
from
the
other
two
as
i
cleaned
out
the
and
scoured
the
and
how
i
pictured
him
to
myself
wandering
with
my
faithful
jens
over
the
best
and
scaring
away
all
the
deer
with
his
bond
street
express
i
say
skipper
put
in
esau
did
bond
street
express
make
any
more
row
than
because
if
my
dear
fellow
said
the
skipper
you
always
put
that
kind
of
expression
into
narrative
it
s
homeric
an
educated
man
would
be
pleased
with
it
i
was
always
expecting
jens
every
sound
real
or
imaginary
caused
me
to
look
up
over
the
deserted
lake
and
hold
my
breath
while
i
listened
to
make
out
his
voice
in
the
distance
and
when
i
went
down
the
river
i
heard
his
cheery
shout
in
the
rush
of
every
rapid
and
the
roar
of
every
fall
after
all
it
was
only
three
days
and
then
one
afternoon
i
found
him
waiting
for
me
at
the
hut
i
was
glad
to
see
him
gladder
than
i
am
to
hear
the
at
home
as
glad
as
a
bee
is
to
get
into
the
open
air
after
bunting
its
head
against
a
for
three
days
beautiful
simile
from
john
and
especially
glad
to
see
how
pleased
old
jens
was
to
return
to
me
again
i
was
also
not
particularly
sorry
to
hear
that
he
had
found
a
herd
of
deer
and
taken
lord
within
shot
and
the
only
result
was
a
calf
which
jens
himself
shot
after
the
englishman
had
missed
after
this
i
had
a
good
time
with
grand
fishing
and
more
deer
but
we
did
not
stay
much
longer
at
rus
vand
as
you
know
i
was
back
in
england
by
the
end
of
the
story
ended
we
called
the
men
in
and
had
a
great
settlement
of
wages
and
milk
bills
and
arranged
how
the
skipper
s
baggage
should
be
transported
tomorrow
and
the
rest
next
week
illustration
a
night
at
rusvasoset
after
a
day
at
haircutting
then
we
filled
up
glasses
round
with
whisky
and
drank
a
solemn
skaal
pronounced
skole
to
every
one
and
then
to
gammle
norgé
and
finished
the
evening
with
auld
lang
it
must
have
been
a
ludicrous
sight
as
we
stood
tightly
packed
in
that
tiny
room
with
heads
all
bent
towards
the
centre
to
avoid
the
rafters
our
hands
crossed
in
orthodox
fashion
and
roaring
at
our
highest
respective
pitches
as
much
of
the
words
as
we
knew
while
we
swayed
our
arms
up
and
down
in
the
manner
essential
to
the
proper
rendering
of
the
good
old
song
when
the
men
cleared
out
esau
produced
a
gorgeous
counterpane
which
he
had
commissioned
peter
to
buy
in
vaage
six
weeks
ago
and
which
the
old
man
brought
over
from
besse
sæter
its
manufacture
is
peculiar
to
this
district
it
is
woven
in
most
tasteful
colours
red
magenta
blue
and
green
being
the
most
prominent
with
a
kind
of
diamond
pattern
in
white
running
diagonally
across
it
but
from
the
what
s
the
next
article
air
with
which
esau
exhibited
it
we
began
to
suspect
that
he
was
rather
disappointed
with
it
and
wanted
to
induce
some
one
to
buy
it
suffice
it
to
say
that
its
introduction
was
received
with
coldness
this
was
a
bad
day
for
sport
we
caught
very
little
and
shot
less
we
did
spy
a
reindeer
directly
after
breakfast
but
as
he
was
about
six
miles
away
close
to
the
top
of
one
of
the
highest
mountains
and
running
as
if
loki
were
after
him
no
one
cared
about
pursuing
him
john
fishing
in

managed
to
lose
a

and
twenty
yards
of

was
quite
discontented
at
night
the
wind
had
increased
to
a
storm
and
the
clouds
were
right
down
on
the
water

hurrying
past
in
endless
wreathing
drifts
like
witches
trooping
to
their
nocturnal

chapter

not
lost
but
gone
before
early
this
morning
we
sorrowfully
packed
the
skipper
s
things
on
the
pony
and
then
we
three
and
öla
marched
off
down
the
river
towards
civilisation
the
skipper
hoped
to
get
over
about
miles
before
night
esau
wanted
to
try
the
river
a
long
way
down
and
john
said
he
always
liked
a
stroll
on
sunday
and
with
that
object
accompanied
the
skipper
for
the
first
eleven
miles
of
his
journey
returning
to
rusvasoset
in
time
for
dinner
about
four
miles
below
rus
lake
the
river
which
is
there
about
thirty
yards
wide
suddenly
disappears
into
a
narrow
cleft
in
the
rocky
bed
and
runs
in
this
curious
rift
for
several
hundred
yards
and
then
again
emerges
into
daylight
the
sides
of
this
rocky
prison
are
just
over
a
yard
apart
at
the
narrowest
place
though
the
gap
only
appears
to
be
a
few
inches
wide
but
the
force
with
which
the
immense
body
of
water
is
squeezed
through
the
tortuous
passage
far
down
below
whirling
huge
boulders
along
with
irresistible
force
and
covering
the
surrounding
rocks
with
moisture
from
the
misty
spray
makes
it
a
severe
trial
to
the
nerves
to
step
across
the
cleft
the
ceaseless
din
of
the
rushing
water
is
of
itself
sufficiently
appalling
this
channel
has
evidently
been
gradually
worn
down
through
the
solid
rock
which
here
appears
to
be
a
reef
of
softer
nature
than
the
usual
formation
of
this
country
on
the
top
and
in
niches
all
the
way
down
are
still
to
be
seen
the
turn
holes
caused
by
stones
working
round
and
round
in
an
eddy
but
the
curious
fact
is
that
while
at
the
top
the
cleft
is
only
a
yard
across
it
widens
regularly
out
as
it
gets
deeper
and
at
the
bottom
is
fully
ten
yards
in
width
now
it
seems
unlikely
that
the
russen
river
could
ever
have
been
content
to
run
in
a
bed
so
much
narrower
than
its
present
one
and
from
the
appearance
of
the
strata
we
imagine
that
as
it
worked
down
and
undermined
the
cliffs
at
each
side
they
have
gradually
toppled
forward
to
meet
each
other
probably
soon
they
will
actually
touch
after
which
a
very
short
time
will
see
the
natural
arch
so
formed
covered
with
vegetation
and
the
river
will
run
in
a
subterranean
passage
through
this
channel
no
fish
could
pass
alive
so
there
esau
bade
farvel
to
the
skipper
and
encumbered
with
rod
and
fishing
bag
leaped
like
a
goat
across
the
intervening
devil
s
dyke
and
was
soon
lost
to
view
as
he
fished
his
way
up
stream
the
other
two
pursued
their
journey
steadily
and
found
it
pleasant
to
gradually
walk
down
from
the
scotch
mist
which
overhung
everything
up
at
rus
vand
into
firstly
dull
dry
weather
just
below
the
clouds
and
then
a
little
further
into
real
sunshine
and
warmth
about
one
o
clock
they
reached
hind
sæter
the
tenants
of
which
were
still
there
but
just
in
the
act
of
removing
to
the
valley
here
they
feasted
together
on
fladbrod
and
then
the
things
were
packed
on
a
cart
and
the
skipper
following
them
as
they
jolted
away
under
öla
s
guidance
through
the
pine
forest
was
seen
no
more
by
his
disconsolate
comrade
when
john
returned
to
rusvasoset
a
little
before
we
found
it
necessary
to
bake
bread
and
a
pie
our
invariable
rule
when
in
this
was
not
a
case
that
admitted
of
any
hesitation
for
the
skipper
had
taken
all
the
food
that
he
could
annex
for
his
sustenance
on
the
journey
as
he
did
not
expect
to
find
any
people
in
the
sæters
on
his
path
the
evening
was
spent
in
general
tidying
and
mending
various
articles
which
had
gone
wrong
holes
in
rents
in
trousers
and
coats
and
inserting
new
screws
in
esau
s
boots
for
the
stalk
he
hoped
but
hardly
expected
to
make
on
the
morrow
at
night
the
outlook
was
anything
but
encouraging
dense
clouds
folding
all
nature
in
their
cold
embrace
and
the
pitiless
rain
beating
down
on
our
poor
little
hut
as
if
it
took
a
pleasure
in
the
occupation

nothing
but

we
never
knew
when
sunrise
and
daybreak
took
place
or
whether
they
happened
at
all
for
the
prospect
was
more
hopeless
than
ever
and
the
rain
still
fell
with
unabated
vigour
we
were
at
the
end
of
our
indoor
resources
but
fortunately
öla
returned
with
some
english
papers
which
he
had
found
waiting
for
us
at
ransværk
the
sæter
at
which
he
and
the
skipper
passed
the
night
and
at
which
this
bundle
of
literature
had
been
deposited
about
a
fortnight
ago
by
the
latest
traveller
from
vaage
but
for
this
there
would
certainly
have
been
bloodshed
in
this
remote
spot
our
tempers
not
being
equal
to
the
strain
of
two
days
in
succession
without
being
able
to
see
ten
yards
in
front
of
us
or
to
stir
out
without
becoming
even
the
fish
were
apparently
at
last
disgusted
at
not
being
able
to
get
into
a
dry
corner
by
jumping
out
of
the
water
and
our
efforts
to
persuade
them
to
try
the
interior
of
a
waterproof
bag
only
met
with
indifferent
success
the
stubborn
resistance
of
our
roof
has
at
last
been
overcome
and
soon
after
turning
in
last
night
we
had
to
turn
out
again
to
rig
up
various
hydrostatic
appliances
with
a
view
to
diverting
the
course
of
some
of
the
superfluous
rainfall
and
irrigating
the
floor
therewith
instead
of
letting
the
beds
get
it
all
the
latter
really
needed
it
much
less
than
the
boards
which
were
somewhat
dusty
but
probably
the
mistake
arose
from
john
sitting
on
one
of
them
while
he
mixed
the
dough
so
that
it
might
have
been
taken
for
a
at
last
we
were
relieved
by
a
change
in
the
wind
soon
followed
by
a
cessation
of
rain
and
then
the
mist
began
to
lift
and
by
noon
the
sun
was
actually
beginning
to
glimmer
feebly
and
the
mountains
to
be
visible

half
their

john
went
on
a
general
tour
of
mountaineering
and
prospecting
in
search
of
scenery
and
came
back
delighted
with
himself
having
made
a
higher
climb
than
usual
and
seen
nautgardstind
in
all
the
perfect
beauty
with
which
the
newly
fallen
snow
had
endowed
him
it
has
already
been
mentioned
that
john
does
like
walking
uphill
and
when
he
makes
a
and
voluntary
ascent
as
he
did
he
comes
home
brimming
over
with
an
excess
of
conscious
virtue
which
does
not
pass
away
until
the
genial
influence
of
a
good
meal
and
a
pipe
has
reduced
him
to
the
level
of
all
humanity
on
his
way
home
he
heard
a
feeble
squeak
in
a
bush
and
peering
in
discovered
a
small
animal
which
he
at
first
took
for
a
but
soon
perceiving
that
it
must
be
a
lemming
his
natural
impulse
was
to
poke
it
with
a
stick
this
was
his
first
interview
with
one
though
they
are
common
enough
up
here
and
he
is
disposed
to
think
them
morose
in
disposition
but
really
he
ought
to
have
recognised
the
fact
that
the
thin
end
of
a
is
not
a
means
of
intercourse
at
all
likely
to
arouse
the
sympathy
of
any
animal
least
of
all
that
of
a
juvenile
lemming
who
is
obviously
overcome
with
drowsiness
and
wants
to
be
let
alone
the
winter
is
now
coming
on
apace
and
already
every
fall
of
rain
down
here
is
a
snowstorm
in
the
mountains
and
every
clear
night
means
a
biting
frost
up
there
esau
scaling
the
heights
of
bes
hö
with
jens
in
search
of
deer
found
none
on
account
of
the
mist
and
in
addition
to
the
danger
of
getting
lost
a
new
peril
was
added
by
the
snow
it
appeared
that
during
the
night
a
severe
frost
had
immediately
followed
the
rain
and
coated
everything
with
ice
then
snow
had
fallen
to
the
depth
of
three
inches
and
on
the
top
of
that
rain
and
sharp
frost
again
the
result
was
that
at
every
step
they
broke
through
the
crust
of
ice
on
the
top
and
sank
through
the
three
inches
of
soft
snow
on
to
the
lower
stratum
of
ice
this
was
all
very
well
as
long
as
they
were
on
rough
ground
but
the
snow
making
every
place
look
the
same
in
one
instance
they
got
on
to
one
of
the
steep
little
glaciers
which
are
common
on
bes
hö
without
knowing
that
they
had
done
so
and
suddenly
jens
lost
his
footing
and
began
to
slide
downwards
at
a
terrific
speed
it
seemed
to
esau
that
he
would
shoot
straight
down
into
rus

very
blue
and
cold
three
thousand
feet
below
but
a
friendly
boulder
intervened
and
by
its
assistance
and
by
spreading
himself
out
like
a
gigantic
spider
he
managed
to
arrest
his
wild
career
and
they
got
safe
across
the
treacherous
glacier
they
had
to
cross
another
on
their
return
which
was
done
with
fear
and
trembling
but
although
the
difficulties
of
this
kind
of
stalking
when
unaccompanied
by
deer
may
seem
to
outnumber
the
pleasures
still
occasionally
they
were
on
fairly
safe
ground
and
could
get
their
hearts
out
of
their
mouths
for
a
few
brief
moments
at
such

splendid

the
solemn
stillness
only
broken
now
and
again
by
the
twittering
of
a
flock

buntings
amply
repaid
them
for
the
arduous
climb
then
a
few
minutes
of
glorious
excitement
as
by
the
aid
of
glissades
they
shot
down

it

surmount

glissading

in

asserted
to
be
the
very
best
fish

and
colour
that
ever
came

anywhere
else

not

a
last
stalk
the
morning
did
not
belie
its
fair
promise
but
opened
as
brightly
as
the
most
exacting
hunter
could
require
illustration
off
a
reindeer
recollecting
an
engagement
esau
and
jens
made
a
last
laborious
and
fruitless
stalk
trying
not
only
the
whole

but
crossing
the

northwards
into

and
traversing
all
the
slopes
of

a
most
splendid
sight
just
now
with
his
towering
pyramid
feet
high
such
a
walk
would
have
been
impossible
but
for
the
snow
which
had
been
reduced
by
the
wind
to
the
consistence
of
hard
sand
and
made
the
going
as
good
as
it
could
be
esau
who
saw
nothing
all
day
was
a
little
annoyed
on
his
return
to
hear
that
john
had
wandered
but
a
short
distance
up
nautgardstind
to
gloat
over
the
view
and
there
walked
almost
into
a
reindeer
buck
which
as
john
was
armed
with
no
more
deadly
weapon
than
a
field
glass
had
escaped
uninjured
twas
ever
thus
however
the
mention
of
this
buck
opened
on
john
s
devoted
head
the
floodgates
of
esau
s
memory
and
he
insisted
on
telling
about
his
last
stalk
here
two
years
ago
as
follows
by
george
i
shall
never
forget
how
jens
and
i
turned
out
that
morning
across
the
same
precipice
that
you
passed
to
get
up
nautgardstind
we
started
pretty
early
because
it
was
my
last
day
and
i
had
sworn
to
catch
something
or
perish
about
ten
o
clock
we
saw
four
deer
a
fine
buck
and
three
does
on
a
long
narrow
on
the
east
side
of
the
mountain
they
were
about
a
mile
off
and
moving
away
with
the
wind
blowing
straight
from
them
to
us
so
we
went
after
them
as
fast
as
we
could
without
much
attempt
at
concealment
at
first
presently
they
left
the
snow
and
turned
to
the
left
as
if
to
skirt
round
the
mountain
we
still
following
and
getting
rather
nearer
to
them
they
seemed
very
restless
and
kept
moving
and
at
last
began
to
trot
and
soon
got
out
of
our
sight
we
were
half
an
hour
without
seeing
them
again
and
at
last
jens
discovered
them
far
down
below
us
in
the
large
valley
where
you
saw
that
one
the
place
where
they
were
was
quite
unapproachable
but
jens
pointed
out
a
sort
of
pass
by
which
he
thought
it
was
likely
they
might
leave
the
valley
and
so
we
went
and
hid
ourselves
in
a
convenient
nook
fifty
yards
to
the
leeward
of
that
place
there
we
lay
in
a
bitterly
cold
wind
for
an
hour
and
then
the
deer
began
to
come
in
our
direction
now
was
the
critical
moment
there
were
two
practicable
routes
in
the
pass
would
they
choose
the
nearer
one
which
would
give
me
a
shot
or
the
other
they
stopped
a
little
time
to
look
for
food
and
provokingly
grazed
their
way
very
slowly
towards
the
wrong
one
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
seemed
to
make
up
their
minds
and
turned
to
the
right
one
the
cold
and
cramp
were
forgotten
as
the
deer
came
within
three
hundred
yards
and
were
nearing
us
quickly
and
with
rifle
cocked
i
was
already
wondering
whether
the
buck
s
horns
were
in
velvet
or
not
and
thinking
what
a
splendid
coat
he
had
when
without
any
warning
a
storm
of
sleet
swept
down
upon
us
and
a
dense
mist
drifted
over
the
mountain
and
shut
out
from
our
gaze
the
rocky
pass
and
deer
alike
wrapped
in
impenetrable
gloom
for
fully
half
an
hour
this
lasted
and
then
the
mist
cleared
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
the
sleet
stopped
and
the
sun
shone
out
making
the
ground
fairly
smoke
but
alas
the
deer
were
gone
we
looked
for
their
tracks
and
found
that
they
had
actually
passed
within
forty
yards
of
us
during
the
storm
but
our
chance
was
missed
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
renew
the
search
another
hour
of
walking
and
jens
quick
eye
caught
sight
of
them
this
time
high
above
our
heads
on
some
snow
near
the
top
of
nautgardstind
and
at
last
thank
goodness
lying
down
there
seemed
to
be
a
possibility
of
getting
to
them
and
we
spent
another
hour
crawling
like
serpents
in
the
attempt
only
to
find
our
way
barred
when
we
were
within
four
hundred
yards
by
a
ridge
over
which
we
could
not
pass
unseen
however
from
there
we
saw
plainly
that
we
could
approach
them
by
going
up
the
mountain
and
then
coming
quite
straight
down
above
them
with
hardly
any
difficult
ground
to
traverse
so
we
performed
that
weary
crawl
back
again
until
we
were
safely
out
of
sight
and
then
went
up
nautgardstind
at
a
speed
that
has
never
been
equalled
half
an
hour
took
us
to
the
top
and
then
jens
made
the
only
mistake
in
a
stalk
that
i
ever
saw
he
got
his
bearings
wrong
somehow
and
thought
that
the
deer
were
on
one
bit
of
snow
the
top
end
of
which
we
could
see
while
i
thought
they
were
on
another
of
course
i
had
much
more
confidence
in
jens
opinion
than
in
my
own
but
it
turned
out
that
he
was
wrong
and
in
crawling
to
the
place
where
he
expected
them
to
be
we
unluckily
came
into
full
view
of
the
snow
where
they
really
were
a
fact
which
was
made
unpleasantly
apparent
to
us
by
our
suddenly
catching
sight
of
four
deer
galloping
down
the
drift
two
hundred
yards
away
i
took
a
careful
aim
at
the
buck
but
fired
too
low
and
the
bullet
broke
his
which
did
not
prevent
him
from
following
the
does
though
at
a
reduced
pace
now
i
think
our
best
chance
would
have
been
to
remain
perfectly
still
and
trust
to
his
stopping
in
time
in
some
place
where
i
could
get
to
him
but
jens
was
terribly
excited
begging
me
to
shoot
and
my
own
head
was
by
no
means
as
cool
as
it
should
have
been
so
i
sat
on
a
rock
and
fired
away
all
my
remaining
cartridges
except
two
at
the
gradually
receding
form
of
the
reindeer
i
suppose
at
the
last
shot
he
was
five
hundred
yards
away
and
i
don
t
think
i
ever
hit
him
again
presently
he
got
round
the
corner
to
the
right
and
into
the
next
valley
where
a
few
days
before
i
had
killed
two
deer
and
as
i
ran
to
the
right
above
him
an
astonishing
sight
met
my
gaze
the
valley
was
full
of
deer
about
fifty
altogether
in
three
distinct
herds
and
they
were
all
running
about
frightened
by
the
firing
and
not
sure
in
which
direction
it
would
be
safe
to
go
while
we
watched
them
from
our
peak
a
mile
above
a
buck
and
two
does
with
a
calf
left
the
herd
and
began
to
come
towards
the
very
snowdrift
on
which
the
four
deer
were
lying
when
we
made
the
fatal
mistake
what
became
of
the
rest
we
never
knew
nor
whither
our
wounded
buck
went
for
when
we
saw
this
fresh
four
making
for
the
drift
it
occurred
to
us
to
run
towards
the
top
and
try
to
intercept
them
if
they
should
attempt
to
ascend
the
mountain
on
the
snow
as
we
expected
they
would
off
we
ran
at
top
speed
over
terribly
rough
ground
and
before
we
got
nearly
in
shot
of
the
top
of
the
long
drift
we
saw
the
deer
get
on
to
it
at
the
bottom
and
begin
to
gallop
up
with
their
untiring
stride
it
was
simply
a
race
with
long
odds
on
the
running
rein
and
soon
we
saw
them
standing
at
the
top
while
we
were
still
over
two
hundred
yards
from
it
then
for
the
first
time
they
saw
us
for
the
drift
was
in
a
ravine
and
out
of
our
sight
as
we
ran
and
they
turned
to
flee
but
jens
somehow
managed
to
find
breath
enough
to
whistle
and
the
deer
stopped
for
a
moment
i
fired
my
last
two
cartridges
but
in
the
condition
to
which
i
was
reduced
by
the
run
i
could
not
have
hit
a
haystack
and
no
damage
was
done
so
we
turned
homewards
with
deep
and
abiding
sorrow
in
our
hearts
too
despondent
to
look
again
for
our
wounded
buck
or
to
see
what
became
of
the
other
herds
in
those
days
i
always
took
out
seven
cartridges
which
i
fondly
imagined
to
be
a
lucky
number
but
after
this
i
solemnly
registered
two
vows
firstly
never
to
go
out
with
so
few
again
and
secondly
never
to
shoot
them
all
away
at
absurd
distances
in
the
forlorn
hope
of
killing
a
wounded
esau
here
paused
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
resumed
by
jove
i
did
make
myself
agreeable
to
the
skipper
when
i
got
home
that
night
i
remember
he
said
but
john
thought
it
was
turn
to
have
a
few
weeks
conversation
and
rudely
interrupted
esau
s
reminiscences
by
calling
his
attention
to
some
writing
which
like
belshazzar
he
had
detected
on
the
wall
above
his
bed
it
was
in
pencil
and
seemed
to
have
been
written
in
prehistoric
times
for
it
was
all
illegible
except
the
first
two
lines
and
even
those
required
a
great
deal
of
deciphering
by
the
aid
of
a
dripping
candle
while
esau
knelt
on
his
bunk
and
flattened
his
nose
against
the
log
wall
before
he
could
read
them
then
after
licking
the
tip
of
a
pencil
for
a
long
time
in
meditative
silence
he
scrawled
the
remainder
of
the
poem
underneath
so
that
the
whole
composition
read
as
follows
a
reindeer
three
miles
off
you
spy
and
to
shoot
that
reindeer
you
will
try
first
a
mile
at
the
top
of
your
speed
you
go
then
you
climb
a
mile
up
loose
rocks
and
snow
then
a
mile
on
your
hands
and
knees
you
crawl
and
when
you
have
executed
these
little
manœuvres
and
arrived
at
the
place
with
your
garments
all
in
tatters
and
your
whole
body
a
mass
of
bruises
in
all
probability
you
will
either
find
that
the
insidious
animal
has
removed
himself
to
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
five
minutes
before
your
appearance
on
the
scene
or
else
you
get
a
shot
at
him
and
you
miss
that
reindeer
after
all
chapter
xxxiii
homeward
bound
our
ears
were
gladdened
by
the
sound
of
ivar
s
hoarse
cachinnation
some
time
during
the
night
or
early
morning
and
on
turning
out
he
informed
us
that
he
should
have
been
here
yesterday
but
his
cart
had
been
smashed
on
the
road
beyond
hind
sæter
however
he
had
patched
it
up
and
got
it
to
the
sæter
so
we
distributed
our
goods
on
the
two
ponies
after
seizing
our
last
chance
of
a
square
meal
by
eating
an
enormous
breakfast
of
venison
pie
cutlets
and
trout
all
our
stores
came
to
an
end
yesterday
except
candles
and
soap
the
latter
article
has
for
some
time
been
lying
in
great
bars
on
a
shelf
as
a
reproach
to
us
and
we
were
glad
to
get
it
out
of
our
sight
and
give
it
to
the
men
as
we
would
anything
else
that
is
repulsive
to
our
feelings
there
were
a
few
scraps
of
other
delicacies
which
we
divided
among
the
retainers
and
then
taking
with
us
a
of
stor
bock
for
our
own
consumption
on
the
journey
and
a
carefully
sewn
up
in
the
sail
of
esau
s
canoe
and
intended
as
a
present
for
thomas
we
regretfully
took
leave
of
the
little
hut
and
started
for
besse
sæter
öla
and
jens
were
sent
down
the
russen
river
which
is
the
nearest
way
to
hind
sæter
and
ivar
was
to
meet
us
at
the
eastern
end
of
sjödals
lake
as
soon
as
he
could
get
there
we
paused
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
to
have
a
last
look
at
the
beautiful
lake
and
quaint
little
huts
and
to
take
off
our
hats
to
grand
old
nautgardstind
to
whom
we
hoped
we
were
not
bidding
an
eternal
farvel
and
then
we
turned
across
the
fjeld
and
losing
sight
of
the
rus
valley
were
soon
looking
forward
again
to
the
change
and
uncertainty
of
the
homeward
journey
from
besse
sæter
which
was
reached
at
noon
we
launched
our
craft
into
the
lake
with
a
nasty
blowing
which
delayed
our
progress
considerably
so
that
we
took
an
hour
to
reach
the
lower
end
of
the
lake
a
distance
of
not
quite
four
miles
there
we
found
ivar
with
his
pony
and
sleigh
on
which
the
canoe
was
conveyed
to
the
junction
of
the
sjoa
and
russen
rivers
where
esau
launched
her
again
and
ran
the
rapids
down
to
ruslien
sæter
a
very
fine
bit
of
stream
in
which
the
canoe
could
only
just
manage
to
live
finding
that
the
sæter
girls
were
still
here
we
went
in
and
asked
for
milk
they
suggested
cream
amendment
carried
without
a
division
a
huge
bowl
of
the
thickest
and
most
delicious
cream
was
set
before
us
which
we
armed
with
two
enormous
spoons
attacked
and
soon
consumed
utterly
with
an
indefinite
amount
of
fladbrod
and
cheese
charge
for
the
whole
sixpence
we
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
the
cream
alone
would
have
been
worth
its
weight
in
gold
in
piccadilly
we
then
regained
our
craft
and
had
a
delightful
cruise
down
to
hind
sæter
the
stream
going
at
speed
all
the
way
so
that
we
did
the
two
and
a
half
miles
in
fifteen
minutes
arriving
long
before
our
cavalcade
of
men
and
ponies
who
started
twenty
minutes
before
us
while
we
were
discussing
the
cream
the
sæter
was
deserted
for
the
winter
but
ivar
produced
his
cart
from
the
bed
of
a
stream
where
he
had
left
it
to
improve
the
wheels
and
at
five
we
with
jens
and
one
cart
resumed
our
journey
leaving
the
other
two
men
with
the
canoe
to
follow
us
we
had
originally
intended
to
make
the
journey
to
lillehammer
from
here
entirely
by
canoe
down
the
sjoa
until
it
joined
the
laagen
but
the
premature
departure
of
the
skipper
knocked
that
little
scheme
on
the
head
it
would
have
been
a
tremendous
enterprise
for
the
sjoa
is
such
a
turbulent
river
that
there
would
have
been
a
great
deal
of
portage
to
be
done
but
we
had
agreed
to
allow
a
fortnight
for
it
and
were
looking
forward
to
it
with
great
delight
the
laagen
is
a
fairly
navigable
river
all
the
way
with
the
exception
of
a
few
very
large
falls
but
there
is
a
good
road
by
its
side
so
that
we
should
have
had
no
difficulty
if
we
had
been
lucky
enough
ever
to
reach
it
however
the
best
laid
schemes
o
mice
an
men
gang
aft
and
we
were
reduced
to
the
prosaic
necessity
of
walking
and
helping
to
hold
our
luggage
onto
a
jolting
cart
as
we
gradually
descended
into
the
we
were
much
struck
by
the
beautiful
effects
of
the
variegated
autumn
tints
and
soon
the
brilliant
reds
and
yellows
of
the
birches
began
to
contrast
with
the
dark
green
of
the
fir
trees
the
light
greyish
green
of
the
lichen
and
rich
brown
and
purple
of
the
ground
and
undergrowth
it
was
so
long
since
we
had
seen
any
trees
that
their
beauty
seemed
to
come
to
us
quite
as
a
new
sensation
below
hind
sæter
the
road
lay
through
dense
forests
of
pines
for
mile
after
mile
with
hardly
any
change
except
where
we
got
occasional
glimpses
of
the
sjoa
tearing
madly
along
far
beneath
us
so
far
that
only
a
faint
murmur
came
up
from
the
leaping
hurrying
waters
hour
after
hour
we
walked
and
still
the
same
dark
forest
gloomed
above
us
so
remote
from
the
busy
haunts
of
men
that
it
seems
not
to
be
worth
any
one
s
while
to
cut
the
trees
except
for
use
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
and
hundreds
of
them
lie
naked
and
dead
as
they
have
fallen
before
the
fury
of
the
gale
and
slowly
rot
or
are
devoured
by
insects
until
their
place
is
ready
for
a
successor
as
the
shades
of
evening
began
to
close
we
were
several
times
startled
as
the
huge
body
of
a
capercailzie
darted
across
the
road
at
a
pace
which
seemed
impossible
to
such
an
enormous
bird
and
with
an
absence
of
noise
that
appeared
equally
unnatural
about
eight
we
came
to
a
more
open
part
of
the
forest
and
soon
we
saw
a
glimmering
light
ahead
jens
cheerily
said
ransværk
and
in
a
few
more
minutes
we
pulled
up
at
the
door
of
a
large
sæter
without
knocking
jens
opened
the
door
and
we
walked
in
and
struck
a
light
there
was
the
usual
fireplace
and
table
and
in
the
further
corner
a
bed
which
as
we
presently
perceived
was
occupied
by
two
girls
this
discovery
embarrassed
us
a
little
but
no
one
else
least
of
all
the
girls
themselves
appeared
to
be
at
all
disconcerted
in
our
favoured
land
a
woman
would
probably
be
slightly
concerned
if
she
were
aroused
from
sleep
by
the
unceremonious
entrance
into
her
room
of
three
men
two
of
them
strangers
of
foreign
exterior
but
not
so
these
artless
beings
the
elder
one
at
once
got
out
of
bed
and
proceeded
to
dress
while
her
sister
remained
where
she
was
and
soon
fell
asleep
when
the
dressing
commenced
we
being
innocent
young
bachelors
retired
and
remained
outside
till
it
was
finished
but
we
do
not
believe
she
appreciated
our
delicacy
at
all
then
this
poor
girl
no
doubt
very
tired
after
a
hard
day
s
work
at
proceeded
to
relight
the
fire
prepare
coffee
and
broil
some
venison
for
us
and
just
as
we
finished
a
hearty
meal
öla
and
ivar
arrived
so
that
she
had
to
begin
all
over
again
for
them
finally
in
spite
of
our
remonstrances
she
dragged
her
sister
out
of
the
bed
and
insisted
on
our
having
it
while
they
went
and
slept
in
another
building
a
few
yards
away
so
john
took
the
bed
they
had
vacated
while
esau
made
a
couch
for
himself
in
the
and
we
slept
the
sleep
of
the
virtuous
penniless
wanderer
verily
they
have
a
better
idea
in
norway
of
true
hospitality
than
in
any
other
country
under
the
sun
how
strange
that
our
return
to
the
haunts
of
men
should
be
chiefly
marked
by
the
sparseness
of
the
fare
provided
for
breakfast
a
tin
of
sardines
took
the
place
of
the
usual
trout
and
although
ransværk
consists
of
a
group
of
several
sæters
and
almost
attains
to
the
dignity
of
a
village
and
our
quarters
were
in
the
largest
and
most
imposing
mansion
there
were
no
forks
or
spoons
to
be
obtained
and
we
had
to
fish
our
sardines
out
of
their
native
oil
with
a
tollekniv
assisted
by
a
finger
and
convey
them
to
our
mouths
with
the
same
implements
after
breakfast
esau
and
jens
turned
out
in
pursuit
of
capercailzie
which
abound
in
the
forest
here
but
though
they
persevered
until
three
o
clock
and
got
several
shots
the
annoying
birds
all
went
on
as
an
english
keeper
generally
says
when
you
ask
did
you
see
if
i
killed
that
rabbit
esau
had
used
up
all
his
large
shot
at
ducks
up
at
gjendin
and
his
cartridges
were
perfectly
ineffectual
at
such
a
strong
bird
as
the
capercailzie
besides
this
they
are
extremely
wary
and
always
rise
about
thirty
yards
from
the
shooter
they
fly
quite
straight
and
so
are
very
easy
to
hit
but
though
esau
knocked
clouds
of
feathers
out
of
them
at
every
shot
and
did
bring
one
to
the
ground
which
from
the
closeness
of
the
underwood
could
not
be
gathered
he
was
obliged
to
submit
to
disappointment
for
once
in
one
part
of
the
forest
they
heard
a
raven
shrieking
angrily
skriking
jens
called
it
which
has
the
same
meaning
in
north
country
dialect
and
going
to
the
place
were
in
time
to
see
a
goshawk
gliding
swiftly
away
with
some
victim
in
its
grasp
in
another
place
there
were
a
lot
of
squirrels
which
jens
induced
esau
to
shoot
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
what
that
purpose
was
we
could
only
guess
by
seeing
him
gather
a
bunch
of
beautiful
wild
currants
and
some
flowers
just
before
reaching
the
sæter
and
then
brush
his
hair
and
march
out
with
his
bouquet
berries
and
to
some
place
unknown
soon
after
three
o
clock
we
resumed
our
march
and
almost
directly
quitted
the
good
vaage
road
along
which
we
travelled
last
night
and
took
to
a
cow
track
on
the
right
the
cart
with
the
canoe
had
a
very
rough
time
of
it
for
the
first
five
or
six
miles
jolting
and
bumping
in
and
out
of
holes
bogs
and
ruts
and
over
boulders
and
logs
in
a
most
appalling
manner
then
we
had
a
piece
of
decent
road
again
and
at
the
finish
another
mile
of
rough
track
soon
after
starting
we
passed
the
sæter
where
jens
lives
when
he
is
not
hunting
in
the
mountains
and
esau
wishing
to
see
what
kind
of
they
use
in
this
part
of
the
country
jens
ran
up
to
the
house
and
fetched
his
to
give
an
idea
of
the
absurd
honesty
which
prevails
here
we
noticed
that
though
jens
had
been
absent
from
home
for
the
last
two
months
and
the
windows
were
shuttered
up
yet
the
door
was
only
latched
and
after
the
inspection
of
the
jens
would
not
trouble
to
take
them
back
but
simply
left
them
by
the
side
of
the
road
to
wait
his
return
three
or
four
days
hence
another
instance
illustrating
the
same
simplicity
occurred
to
us
once
when
travelling
in
quite
a
different
part
of
norway
when
changing
carioles
at
a
station
our
baggage
was
all
heaped
together
on
the
and
as
we
wanted
to
stay
there
an
hour
or
so
for
dinner
and
this
was
a
main
road
with
a
fair
amount
of
traffic
we
suggested
to
the
landlord
that
our
goods
had
better
be
brought
inside
the
station
he
merely
looked
up
at
the
sky
with
a
eye
and
replied
oh
no
i
m
sure
it
won
t
our
route
through
the
forest
was
most
beautiful
at
one
time
descending
to
the
level
of
the
sjoa
and
even
struggling
along
its
bed
where
the
going
on
the
bank
seemed
to
be
inferior
at
another
climbing
up
and
up
and
ever
higher
until
we
stood
on
the
summit
of
the
range
of
hills
which
confine
this
valley
on
the
northern
side
it
is
called
hedalen
and
is
one
of
those
strikingly
beautiful
norwegian
dales
which
occupy
the
space
between
civilisation
and
the
untouched
realms
of
nature
this
evening
the
setting
sun
throwing
a
rich
golden
glow
over
the
scene
and
lighting
up
the
brilliant
autumnal
colours
of
the
trees
gave
us
an
opportunity
of
seeing
it
quite
at
its
best
gradually
the
forest
began
to
get
more
open
and
the
road
to
improve
several
peasants
in
picturesque
garb
were
seen
on
the
wayside
rough
buildings
became
more
frequent
and
fields
and
fences
quite
common
at
first
only
pasture
land
but
soon
and
patches
of
potatoes
then
at
last
in
the
twilight
we
make
a
swift
descent
from
the
ridge
along
which
the
road
runs
a
short
plunge
through
a
thicket
down
a
grassy
track
a
bridge
over
a
little
stream
and
as
we
breast
the
opposite
bank
a
pile
of
buildings
looming
in
front
and
looking
perfectly
gigantic
to
our
eyes
so
long
accustomed
to
the
tiniest
of
huts
and
jens
points
up
cracks
his
whip
and
says
the
pony
boils
up
something
like
a
trot
for
the
avenue
and
rattles
the
cart
into
a
large
square
courtyard
tenanted
only
by
two
huge
dogs
and
as
a
cheery
old
norseman
rushes
out
in
great
excitement
to
welcome
us
and
lead
us
into
a
bright
clean
curtained
room
we
feel
that
we
have
said
farewell
to
the
delights
of
savage
life
and
will
probably
have
to
put
on
a
necktie
here
we
parted
with
our
faithful
jens
and
very
sorry
we
were
to
do
so
as
we
think
him
a
fellow
a
man
with
a
bright
eye
and
stolid
demeanour
naturally
silent
but
game
for
anything
a
keen
sportsman
and
wonderful
stalker
and
without
a
particle
of
the
laziness
and
sulkiness
which
characterised
öla
here
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
lillehammer
in
july
we
slept
between
sheets
our
own
and
only
ivar
has
volunteered
to
what
he
calls
transportare
all
our
baggage
in
his
cart
down
to
lillehammer
distant
about
eighty
miles
hence
for
the
sum
of
shillings
this
sounds
unreasonable
but
it
was
his
own
suggestion
so
we
did
not
argue
the
point
only
stipulating
that
he
should
be
there
by
noon
on
tuesday
being
saturday
and
leaving
the
details
to
him
our
thoughts
were
here
recalled
to
the
skipper
and
his
adventures
by
finding
the
following
note
from
him
dear
esau
i
have
left
behind
me
here
certain
of
what
the
romans
so
appropriately
called
impedimenta
and
hope
that
you
will
be
able
to
bring
them
home
for
me
i
got
an
old
old
man
with
a
small
cart
to
bring
my
luggage
down
from
ransværk
it
was
a
wet
day
i
walked
the
first
nine
miles
while
the
old
man
and
the
rain
were
both
driving
this
ancient
driveller
seemed
to
imagine
it
was
a
fine
day
and
had
hung
on
his
best
coat
and
hat
further
aggravating
his
appearance
with
a
spotted
kerchief
and
a
light
heart
he
seemed
remarkably
cheerful
as
carolling
he
drove
his
carjole
and
cajoled
his
horse
through
the
dripping
pine
forests
i
arrived
here
at
midday
and
the
owner
ivar
tofte
came
out
to
meet
me
he
took
a
great
fancy
to
me
and
we
finished
together
a
bottle
of
the
most
delicious
aquavit
which
he
produced
from
a
cellar
where
it
had
been
laid
down
in
the
time
of
the
vikings
it
is
a
pity
neither
of
you
can
speak
the
language
yours
haughtily
the
we
found
that
the
impedimenta
of
which
the
skipper
had
spoken
were
loaded
cartridges
wrapped
up
in
a
flannel
shirt
the
whole
being
enveloped
in
a
partially
cured
we
were
further
reminded
of
our
lost
one
by
looking
in
the
or
traveller
s
where
his
was
the
last
english
name
this
was
not
surprising
for
though
bjölstad
is
a
posting
station
it
is
a
very
place
but
we
looked
back
for
two
years
without
finding
that
any
other
englishman
had
been
here
and
then
the
skipper
s
name
occurred
again
between
these
dates
the
names
were
all
norwegian
and
there
were
not
very
many
even
of
them
chapter

bjölstad
september
bjölstad
is
an
ancient
norwegian
homestead
and
consists
of
several
separate
buildings
surrounding
a
central
rectangular
court
the
house
that
we
slept
in
bears
the
date
of
and
is
the
most
modern
as
well
as
the
largest
of
the
group
it
is
really
a
suite
of
state
apartments
for
the
use
of
the
king
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
visits
this
part
of
his
dominions
on
the
side
of
the
courtyard
as
we
stand
at
the
door
of
our
state
apartments
is
a
very
quaint
and
picturesque
old
house
with
a
handsome
porch
built
in
the
byzantine
style
date
and
in
this
the
owner
lives
whenever
he
comes
to
this
farm
opposite
to
us
is
another
building
even
more
curious
in
its
architecture
and
considerably
older
than
the
other
and
the
remaining
side
of
the
yard
is
occupied
by
another
more
modern
edifice
used
chiefly
as
a
storehouse
besides
these
there
are
several
other
detached
outbuildings
in
which
sleighs
ploughs
spare
cooking
utensils
rugs
and
various
other
useful
and
useless
articles
are
kept
including
all
the
fittings
and
even
the
weathercock
of
an
ancient
church
which
used
to
stand
close
to
the
farm
but
which
is
now
demolished
and
partly
reduced
to
firewood
illustration
old
buildings
in
the
courtyard
at
bjölstad
the
owner
of
all
this
grandeur
is
one
ivar
tofte
a
wealthy
yeoman
who
has
several
other
farms
in
other
parts
of
the
country
one
of
which
is
much
larger
and
more
important
even
than
bjölstad
and
we
were
lucky
enough
to
find
this
northern
crœsus
at
home
for
it
turned
out
that
he
was
the
cheery
old
man
in
the
shocking
bad
hat
who
had
run
out
to
welcome
us
last
night
this
morning
he
came
into
our
room
after
breakfast
with
a
bottle
of
aquavit
in
his
hand
wherewith
to
drink
our
health
now
to
refuse
this
ceremony
is
an
unpardonable
insult
but
we
had
tasted
aquavit
before
and
had
a
wholesome
dread
of
the
nauseous
compound
reeking
of
carraway
seeds
and
aniseed
which
we
were
accustomed
to
expect
out
of
an
aquavit
bottle
so
we
poured
out
very
small
glasses
clinked
them
in
approved
manner
and
raised
them
to
our
lips
as
we
uttered
the
magic
word
skaal
more
with
a
feeling
of
disgust
than
any
other
sensation
and
then
it
was
beautiful
to
see
a
heavenly
smile
steal
over
esau
s
ingenuous
countenance
while
john
softly
murmuring
chartreuse
by
george
reached
for
the
bottle
and
with
a
shout
of
skaal
ivar
tofte
proceeded
to
fill
himself
a
bumper
it
was
a
perfect
liqueur
soft
delicate
and
mellow
as
probably
age
alone
could
have
made
it
and
we
drank
skaal
to
gammle
norgé
and
england
and
kong
oscar
and
queen
and
ivar
tofte
again
and
then
ourselves
again
whereupon
the
old
man
perceived
that
we
appreciated
his
cuvée
de
réserve
and
went
for
another
full
bottle
which
he
left
in
our
room
so
that
we
could
put
it
to
our
lips
when
we
felt
so
after
this
john
feeling
at
once
genial
and
liberal
announced
his
intention
of
buying
a
sheenfelt
sheepskin
rug
for
importation
into
england
and
tofte
with
an
aged
retainer
volunteered
to
show
us
his
stores
of
sheepskins
first
our
guide
procured
a
bunch
of
enormous
keys
such
as
bluebeard
would
have
hanging
from
his
waist
in
a
pantomime
labelled
key
of
the
umbrella
stand
potted
shrimps
cupboard
where
the
jam
s
kept
then
he
marched
off
to
one
of
the
buildings
followed
by
us
and
the
other
old
man
whose
profession
was
apparently
to
exalt
bjölstad
sheenfelts
and
to
debase
as
far
as
extreme
volubility
and
strict
inattention
to
the
elements
of
truth
would
enable
him
to
accomplish
that
object
an
ancient
one
which
john
wished
to
give
in
part
payment
bluebeard
led
us
up
some
stairs
to
the
blue
chamber
where
we
saw
hanging
in
a
row
the
skins
not
of
his
deceased
wives
but
of
many
fleecy
flocks
to
use
the
beautiful
and
touching
language
of
the
greek
poet
then
the
two
accomplices
selected
the
sheenfelt
which
they
intended
us
to
buy
and
began
to
expatiate
on
its
beauties
in
terms
of
undisguised
admiration
and
after
half
an
hour
s
huckstering
and
haggling
of
course
they
persuaded
john
to
take
that
and
no
other
however
it
was
a
beautiful
specimen
of
this
kind
of
rug
of
a
dark
grey
colour
and
very
thick
warm
and
heavy
so
both
sides
were
highly
satisfied
and
proceeded
to
the
drinking
of
more
aquavit
in
celebration
of
the
bargain
the
weather
was
so
unpleasant
and
bluebeard
and
his
aquavit
were
so
engaging
that
we
decided
not
to
leave
here
till
our
host
was
delighted
to
hear
this
and
at
once
went
for
more
aquavit
which
he
appears
to
consider
the
first
necessity
of
life
and
then
he
proceeded
to
show
us
round
his
ancestral
halls
as
though
he
were
a
sober
old
verger
of
westminster
abbey
there
was
a
sort
of
rip
van
winkle
sleepiness
about
bjölstad
very
soothing
to
men
who
like
us
have
lived
in
the
nineteenth
century
for
some
few
years
all
the
varlets
and
handmaidens
were
dressed
in
the
old
native
costume
so
appropriate
to
the
ancient
wooden
buildings
with
quaintly
carved
eaves
and
doorways
about
which
they
hovered
in
the
courtyard
were
two
enormous
dogs
that
barked
loudly
whenever
we
appeared
but
at
the
same
time
wagged
their
tails
and
looked
imbecile
and
good
natured
there
were
also
four
geese
who
meant
to
be
sitting
basking
in
the
rain
but
as
soon
as
anybody
came
to
one
of
the
numerous
doors
or
crossed
the
yard
they
all
stood
up
and
quacked
solemnly
fourteen
times
each
then
hissed
once
and
sat
down
again
and
as
some
one
was
always
moving
about
the
court
the
quiet
rest
of
those
birds
was
more
anticipatory
than
real
but
they
alone
of
all
the
living
creatures
at
bjölstad
appeared
to
have
any
fixed
employment
which
demanded
constant
attention
bluebeard
first
took
us
through
the
state
apartments
which
contained
many
curious
and
interesting
things
of
all
ages
from
an
axe
nearly
a
thousand
years
old
to
a
birmingham
plated
teapot
won
at
the
christiania
horse
show
in
the
toftes
boast
themselves
descended
from
harald
haarfager
and
are
so
proud
of
their
ancestry
that
from
time
immemorial
they
have
never
married
out
of
their
own
family
if
dear
old
bluebeard
may
be
accepted
as
an
ordinary
result
of
this
system
it
must
be
confessed
that
it
has
its
advantages
the
things
that
he
chiefly
delighted
to
show
us
were
those
which
had
been
used
by
the
king
during
his
occasional
visits
the
most
curious
being
a
large
stone
table
made
of
one
enormous
slab
not
more
than
of
an
inch
thick
but
very
hard
and
elastic
more
like
a
steel
plate
than
stone
gorgeously
embroidered
counterpanes
and
chairs
some
very
old
ploughs
and
sleighs
and
a
box
with
a
marvellous
representation
of
adam
and
eve
very
evidently
before
the
fall
and
the
most
remarkable
thing
in
serpents
which
the
wildest
flight
of
human
imagination
has
yet
conceived
there
were
some
very
nice
silver
utensils
and
ornaments
but
not
many
as
most
of
his
plate
is
kept
at
his
largest
farm
all
that
he
had
here
was
in
a
cupboard
with
a
rubbishy
unlocked
deal
door
standing
in
john
s
bedroom
a
fact
which
speaks
volumes
for
the
trusting
simplicity
and
total
inability
to
read
a
man
s
character
from
his
appearance
caused
by
a
millennium
of
marrying
your
cousin
once
removed
poor
bluebeard
he
little
thought
what
a
viper
he
was
nurturing
in
his
bosom
or
rather
in
his
chest
his
plate
chest
and
that
in
that
room
lay
one
who
could
perhaps
if
he
would
answer
the
questions
who
took
the
gainsborough
who
has
the
dudley
diamonds
who
stole
the
donkey
and
where
s
the
cat
john
has
now
a
large
collection
of
ancient
norwegian
silver
counterpanes
belts
tankards
knives
and
ornaments
to
dispose
of
at
very
low
prices
if
no
questions
are
asked
advt
we
left
bjölstad
in
carioles
on
a
real
road
about
nine
o
clock
bluebeard
himself
assisting
in
the
operation
of
harnessing
the
ponies
and
packing
the
baggage
just
as
we
were
driving
off
a
brilliantly
original
idea
occurred
to
him
and
he
said
come
in
and
taste
my
we
did
not
like

request
so
descended
and
drank
another
skaal
to
all
the
usual
loyal
patriotic
and
festive
toasts
and
then
we
drove
off
murmuring
somewhat
indistinctly

jolly
good
all
day
we
drove
and
ever
as
we
descended
the
hedalen
valley
with
the
noisy
sjoa
on
our
right
hand
the
farming
kept
improving
and
the
country
becoming
more
populous
and
we
saw
many
families
digging
potatoes
many
pigs
roaming
free
and
unmolested
as
they
do
in
ireland
and
a
few
men
bringing
up
stores
from
the
town
for
the
long
season
of
dreariness
now
so
near
at
hand
jens
told
us
that
in
winter
even
so
far
to
the
south
as
vaage
the
sun
only
rises
about
eleven
and
sets
at
one
o
clock
giving
barely
three
hours
of
daylight
in
midwinter
though
he
said
that
in
the
mountains
where
he
spends
his
time
hunting
there
is
rather
more
light
than
in
the
valleys
it
may
be
well
to
explain
in
what
manner
so
much
information
was
obtained
from
men
whose
language
was
unknown
to
us
and
to
whom
ours
was
equally
incomprehensible
the
glorious
principle
of
did
it
all
the
skipper
spoke
norse
with
great
elegance
and
fluency
but
did
not
understand
it
at
all
esau
could
understand
it
perfectly
but
was
unable
to
express
himself
in
that
tongue
to
even
a
limited
extent
and
john
could
neither
speak
nor
understand
a
word
consequently
our
united
accomplishments
were
equal
to
meeting
any
emergency
that
might
arise
even
to
the
disentanglement
of
such
a
coil
as
or
or
any
other
of
the
little
complex
words
that
an
educated
norwegian
can
construct
it
is
wonderful
to
hear
the
natives
launch
out
into
one
of
these
cataracts
they
do
it
fearlessly
and
steer
through
the
whole
with
unflagging
fortitude
and
very
seldom
with
any
fatal
results
the
hay
harvest
seemed
to
be
quite
finished
except
on
the
roofs
of
the
houses
where
some
people
were
still
cutting
and
carrying
their
crops
the
barley
had
just
been
reaped
and
was
now
being
dried
by
the
process
of
impalement
a
dozen
sheaves
one
above
the
other
being
transfixed
by
a
pole
stuck
into
the
ground
just
as
a
naughty
boy
sticks
a
row
of
moths
on
a
long
pin
or
as
the
unfortunate
bulgarians
were
supposed
to
be
exhibited
during
the
atrocity
scare
can
it
be
possible
that
those
stories
arose
from
the
distant
contemplation
of
a
illustration
barley
sheaves
a
norwegian
atrocity
the
norwegians
also
dry
their
hay
in
a
different
manner
from
that
usually
practised
in
england
they
erect
high
hurdles
made
of
larch
poles
in
lines
at
intervals
all
over
the
field
and
on
these
they
hang
the
hay
to
dry
as
we
hang
towels
on
a
horse
and
it
is
by
this
means
so
well
exposed
to
both
air
and
sun
that
it
dries
very
quickly
no
doubt
the
hurdles
are
also
very
useful
in
spring
as
a
shelter
for
the
young
lambs
the
weather
kept
improving
so
much
that
we
grew
quite
jubilant
and
the
scenes
that
opened
before
us
seemed
full
of
life
and
brightness
and
we
looked
with
a
certain
amount
of
pleasure
on
even
the
magpies
which
sat
on
the
fences
in
scores
pluming
their
feathers
and
talking
things
over
quietly
to
themselves
so
different
from
the
wary
magpie
of
england
who
knowing
that
he
is
an
ishmael
glories
in
the
fact
and
shrieks
defiance
to
mankind
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
a
tree
for
three
hours
we
followed
the
brawling
sjoa
through
scenery
that
would
bear
comparison
with
switzerland
and
then
we
reached
the
spot
where
it
joins
the
mighty
laagen
and
crossing
the
latter
by
a
picturesque
but
discouraging
bridge
soon
struck
the
main
road
and
pulled
up
for
our
first
change
of
ponies
at
storklevstad
nineteen
miles
from
bjölstad
at
another
place
further
on
we
found
a
shop
kept
by
a
norwegian
yankee
and
entered
it
to
buy
some
wherewith
to
appease
our
this
storekeeper
informed
us
that
the
emigration
from
norway
to
the
states
was
enormous
just
now
especially
to
minnesota
and
wisconsin
and
that
no
less
than
sixteen
men
had
gone
this
year
from
the
little
village
of
vaage
a
place
which
does
not
strike
one
as
being
likely
to
contain
that
number
of
men
at
one
time
öla
had
told
us
that
five
of
his
brethren
were
in
minnesota
but
that
he
himself
had
no
intention
of
leaving
his
native
country
and
this
we
thought
to
be
well
for
if
he
were
to
join
them
we
are
convinced
that
any
enterprise
in
which
they
might
be
engaged
would
inevitably
fail
with
his
invaluable
and
assistance
unless
perhaps
the
skipper
could
be
induced
to
go
out
there
and
occasionally
exhort
him
at
listad
we
lunched
off
a
real
white
tablecloth
that
is
to
say
we
ate
not
the
cloth
but
everything
eatable
that
was
placed
on
it
we
also
found
a
note
from
the
skipper
asking
us
to
bring
along
one
or
two
little
things
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
leave
behind
in
his
hurried
flight
just
as
the
allied
armies
kept
finding
napoleon
s
belongings
at
different
places
after
waterloo
the
present
loot
consisted
of
a
coat
sleeping
rug
and
a
towel
at
kirkestuen
we
quitted
the
track
for
the
night
having
made
fifty
miles
in
about
ten
hours
this
according
to
our
experience
is
a
fair
rate
of
progression
in
norway
in
fact
the
traveller
is
more
likely
to
find
the
average
below
this
than
above
unless
he
drives
the
good
little
ponies
faster
than
they
like
to
go
which
is
wrong
here
the
three
women
who
kept
the
station
were
immensely
amused
because
we
asked
for
coffee
with
our
food
and
one
of
them
took
upon
herself
the
task
of
rebuking
us
for
such
dissipated
habits
and
explained
at
great
length
that
no
respectable
people
ever
did
such
a
thing
coffee
she
said
should
only
be
drunk
during
the
day
gruel
after
but
we
persisted
in
our
reckless
demand
and
they
finally
gave
in
and
produced
the
delicious
compound
that
may
be
expected
at
any
wretched
little
dwelling
throughout
the
country
this
was
the
first
place
where
the
papered
rooms
and
iron
stoves
of
modern
norway
obtruded
themselves
on
our
notice
but
in
spite
of
these
we
were
very
comfortable
and
think
that
kirkestuen
deserves
all
the
praise
which
we
can
not
find
lavished
upon
it
in
any
of
the
it
is
cheap
comfortable
and
clean
and
the
food
is
excellent
if
the
three
young
ladies
who
preside
over
its
arrangements
wish
to
send
us
any
little
remuneration
for
this
advertisement
we
are
agents
for
several
central
african
missions
to
which
we
could
hand
it
over
or
as
best
aquavit
is
a
good
deal
appreciated
by
the
missionaries
themselves
when
they
are
suffering
from
certain
diseases
peculiar
to
the
central
african
climate
we
would
receive
that
liqueur
in
cases
of
not
less
than
three
dozen
in
lieu
of
money
chapter
xxxv
down
to
christiania
the
steadily
improving
weather
of
our
homeward
journey
is
very
pleasant
and
already
we
are
beginning
to
almost
forget
those
miseries
in
cold
and
grey
which
were
so
conspicuous
during
our
last
few
days
at
rus
vand
we
noticed
that
the
whole
population
of
the
country
appeared
to
be
engaged
in
the
seductive
pastime
of
one
family
that
we
passed
consisted
of
papa
mamma
and
eight
children
of
different
ages
all
absorbed
in
this
pursuit
the
parents
had
gardening
tools
the
elder
children
were
using
pickaxes
and
trowels
the
younger
ones
and
wooden
baking
spades
and
the
mere
babies
were
hard
at
work
with
spoons
and
here
and
there
we
detected
a
few
people
still
making
hay
presumably
because
they
had
no
potatoes
in
norway
the
are
so
steep
and
rocky
that
there
is
not
overmuch
room
for
the
cultivation
of
grass
so
they
have
to
collect
it
from
every
available
corner
where
a
few
sprays
of
anything
green
can
contrive
to
exist
as
we
have
mentioned
they
are
now
curing
grass
on
the
and
we
saw
a
man
with
a
scythe
about
eighteen
inches
long
mowing
in
amongst
the
stones
on
the
river
bank
and
in
some
of
the
places
where
he
went
the
scythe
blade
was
the
only
blade
visible
to
the
naked
eye
one
thing
seems
certain
that
a
norwegian
make
hay
while
the
sun
shines
even
if
he
can
only
find
rocks
out
of
which
to
make
it
on
this
part
of
our
journey
we
passed
a
great
many
spotted
black
and
white
pigs
these
pigs
move
with
a
greater
dignity
of
bearing
than
the
ordinary
white
pig
of
scandinavia
and
altogether
seem
to
consider
themselves
superior
to
him
although
they
have
not
a
curly
tail
personally
we
think
there
is
a
certain
subtle
charm
about
the
curly
tail
of
the
white
pig
a
something
that
sets
him
off
and
renders
him
more
pleasing
to
the
eye
of
the
beholder
than
is
a
spotted
pig
with
a
straight
tail
however
our
humble
opinion
does
not
seem
at
all
to
affect
the
swagger
of
the
spotted
pig
near
formö
we
overtook
a
girl
of
about
eighteen
astride
a
pony
the
pony
was
seized
with
a
spirit
of
emulation
and
insisted
on
accompanying
the
carioles
for
some
distance
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
stop
it
the
weather
was
now
delightful
the
roads
were
dry
and
dusty
and
the
sun
was
so
hot
that
the
long
cool
shadows
of
the
pine
woods
which
at
frequent
intervals
hedge
in
the
road
were
quite
a
welcome
relief
both
to
us
and
our
shaggy
steeds
ever
as
we
followed
the
almost
imperceptible
descent
of
the
road
the
great
river
laagen
became
wider
deeper
and
bluer
as
it
gathered
increased
volume
from
the
numberless
tributaries
which
flow
into
it
from
every
hill
till
at
length
at
fossegaarden
it
plunged
over
a
series
of
ledges
in
a
splendid
succession
of
falls
and
after
winding
awhile
amid
islands
and
shaded
grassy
banks
it
flowed
into
the
mjösen
lake
and
was
lost
while
we
on
the
road
above
rounding
the
last
corner
and
turning
to
the
east
soon
found
ourselves
in
lillehammer
which
really
looked
quite
a
towny
little
town
esau
stopped
at
fossegaarden
a
couple
of
hours
to
throw
a
fly
in
the
water
below
the
falls
and
was
rewarded
at
the
first
cast
by
a
rise
from
a
fish
whose
peculiar
wriggling
and
rolling
soon
showed
him
to
be
a
grayling
and
before
leaving
the
bag
was
filled
with
some
very
fine
specimens
of
this
beautiful
and
delicate
fish
we
were
greeted
as
old
friends
at
the
victoria
hotel
where
ivar
had
already
arrived
with
our
things
then
we
ordered
our
own
dinner
and
told
the
host
to
supply
ivar
with
whatever
he
wanted
regardless
of
expense
the
result
of
this
reckless
munificence
was
a
bill
for
nearly
two
shillings
and
in
the
happy
frame
of
mind
produced
on
both
sides
by
this
course
we
settled
our
accounts
with
him
and
giving
him
all
our
garments
and
some
candles
and
matches
we
parted
with
the
last
of
our
henchmen
by
the
way
we
here
found
a
note
from
the
skipper
asking
us
to
bring
home
a
pair
of
shooting
boots
three
socks
and
the
remains
of
what
had
apparently
been
a
pocket
handkerchief
but
the
obvious
course
that
suggested
itself
was
give
em
to
the
men
and
we
insisted
on
ivar
taking
these
valuables
with
the
utmost
difficulty
by
threats
and
coercion
esau
was
induced
to
leave
his
bed
and
dragged
to
the
steamer
in
time
for
her
departure
as
if
left
to
his
own
inclinations
he
would
have
remained
in
his
insidious
couch
until
this
globe
had
performed
its
diurnal
revolution
as
it
was
the
skiblädner
was
indulging
in
a
final
premonitory
shriek
before
leaving
the
pier
when
we
came
hurrying
and
stumbling
down
the
hill
at
all
paces
and
we
only
stepped
aboard
just
as
she
threw
off
the
last
detaining
rope
the
steamer
was
at
first
very
empty
but
more
people
joined
us
at
every
of
which
there
are
about
a
dozen
on
the
lake
some
of
these
are
little
villages
with
only
the
bright
roofs
and
church
spire
peeping
out
from
among
the
fir
trees
others
no
more
than
a
projecting
into
the
blue
waters
and
no
other
indications
of
life
save
perhaps
a
couple
of
idle
fishing
boats
and
a
flagstaff
the
morning
was
so
calm
and
fine
that
the
grayling
playing
under
the
shore
made
the
only
break
in
the
otherwise
unruffled
surface
of
the
lake
and
it
seemed
strange
to
find
ourselves
back
in
summer
again
having
left
winter
with
its
snow
and
frosts
far
above
us
up
at
rus
vand
only
a
few
days
ago
at
hamar
some
english
people
came
aboard
so
that
we
had
some
one
to
talk
to
at
every
place
where
the
steamer
stopped
and
fresh
passengers
came
off
in
boats
to
meet
us
it
seemed
to
be
customary
that
they
should
take
off
their
hats
to
the
captain
on
the
bridge
as
they
pulled
up
alongside
even
when
we
passed
the
smallest
places
without
stopping
merely
throwing
the
mail
bag
into
a
boat
as
we
darted
by
the
sailors
on
the
steamer
all
took
off
their
hats
to
the
sailors
ashore
the
latter
always
returning
the
salutation
and
considering
the
fact
that
two
steamers
pass
every
day
this
indicates
no
small
degree
of
politeness
there
is
a
great
amount
of
character
to
be
noticed
among
the
natives
during
a
voyage
on
the
lake
and
although
they
are
badly
and
even
grotesquely
dressed
for
the
pretty
old
costume
has
quite
disappeared
in
this
part
of
the
country
and
its
modern
substitute
is
hideous
still
their
manners
and
simple
courtesy
are
very
striking
and
in
spite
of
their
love
of
a
little
mild
ostentation
they
are
so
quiet
and
well
behaved
that
they
would
appear
to
great
advantage
if
contrasted
with
the
crowd
that
may
be
found
say
on
a
greenwich
steamer
at
eidsvold
we
left
the
steamer
for
the
train
which
was
waiting
to
receive
us
and
about
nightfall
were
once
more
in
christiania
and
after
a
sumptuous
supper
went
to
rest
in
sumptuous
beds
thinking
ere
we
fell
asleep
of
how
we
should
again
have
to
submit
ourselves
to
the
yoke
of
civilisation
to
discard
our
flannel
shirts
for
linen
ones
and
collars
to
throw
aside
our
shooting
boots
and
again
bite
off
our
nails
which
have
grown
to
their
natural
length
under
the
soothing
influence
of
a
long
spell
of
unworried
conscience
we
found
christiania
this
morning
almost
as
hot
as
we
left
it
the
streets
all
dry
and
dusty
and
the
trees
parched
for
want
of
rain
and
the
sunshine
was
very
pleasant
as
we
wandered
about
the
town
into
the
various
shops
purchasing
articles
by
the
assistance
of
which
we
hoped
to
attain
popularity
among
our
relatives
on
our
arrival
in
england
the
shopkeepers
were
almost
all
very
slow
in
fact
the
transaction
of
any
business
is
not
the
hardy
norseman
s
strong
point
we
copy
this
extract
from
the
skipper
s
journal
i
went
to
the
bank
this
morning
to
get
some
circular
notes
changed
and
they
kept
me
there
fussing
over
them
for
fifty
minutes
before
i
got
the
money
during
this
time
of
expectation
i
read
two
letters
from
home
through
and
had
a
chase
after
a
torpid
fly
on
the
floor
with
my
stick
considering
his
languid
condition
this
fly
showed
great
spirit
but
after
following
him
about
three
feet
along
the
floor
and
nine
inches
up
the
wall
i
made
a
fortunate
dash
at
him
and
concluded
his
existence
then
i
thought
for
a
while
and
stared
all
round
the
room
and
cut
my
nails
with
my
knife
then
i
counted
how
many
boards
there
were
in
the
floor
and
how
many
nails
there
were
on
an
average
in
each
board
and
made
a
little
calculation
on
these
figures
to
discover
how
many
nails
there
were
in
the
whole
room
and
what
they
weighed
how
much
they
cost
how
many
miles
they
would
reach
if
laid
end
to
end
and
how
many
men
at
how
much
an
hour
for
how
long
it
had
taken
to
drive
them
all
in
then
again
i
thought
for
a
while
but
still
the
money
did
not
come
and
my
moral
reflections
on
men
and
things
had
just
led
me
to
the
conclusion
that
all
mortals
were
but
desolate
creatures
and
that
i
of
all
men
was
most
desolate
and
abandoned
when
at
the
end
of
forty
minutes
an
official
arrived
with
a
sort
of
cheque
and
after
that
it
took
ten
minutes
more
to
change
the
cheque
into
money
in
a
lower
room
where
the
clerks
had
their
hair
so
beautifully
brushed
and
were
so
haughty
that
instead
of
being
angry
i
could
only
thank
them
profusely
for
giving
me
the
money
at
after
finishing
our
hunt
for
curios
it
occurred
to
us
that
we
ought
to
see
the
vikings
ship
recently
unearthed
somewhere
on
the
fjord
so
we
walked
down
to
the
university
where
we
were
told
by
a
student
that
it
was
not
yet
open
to
the
public
but
that
if
we
would
ask
the
professor
of
archæology
whom
john
profanely
designated
the
boss
that
runs
the
antiquity
show
he
had
no
doubt
that
being
strangers
we
should
be
allowed
to
see
the
ship
would
the
fact
of
a
man
being
a
foreigner
obtain
his
admission
to
a
private
view
of
an
english
curiosity
save
perhaps
the
plans
and
mechanism
of
an
or
torpedo
probably
not
revolving
these
thoughts
within
our
minds
we
sought
the
professor
and
he
at
once
left
the
work
upon
which
he
was
engaged
and
took
us
to
the
ship
which
was
locked
up
inside
a
wooden
building
that
has
been
erected
for
it
very
interesting
it
was
the
preservation
of
the
wood
and
also
the
ironwork
being
wonderful
unfortunately
some
archæologists
of
earlier
date
than
the
present
had
also
made
some
excavations
in
search
of
memorials
of
the
past
they
had
cut
a
large
hole
in
the
side
amidships
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
off
the
ornaments
and
other
valuables
by
which
the
dead
viking
was
surrounded
in
the
chamber
constructed
for
his
body
right
in
the
centre
of
the
boat
the
modern
archæologists
call
their
predecessors
sacrilegious
robbers
but
we
are
averse
to
the
use
of
strong
language
among
men
of
science
however
the
rest
of
the
ship
was
perfect
even
to
the
shields
which
used
to
adorn
the
gunwale
which
are
now
seen
to
have
been
made
of
thin
wood
and
were
probably
only
ornamental
she
was
a
good
big
boat
rather
and
low
in
the
water
but
with
great
breadth
of
beam
and
built
on
lines
that
left
no
room
for
doubt
as
to
her
seagoing
qualities
the
whole
day
was
occupied
by
this
shopping
and
and
we
went
to
bed
more
exhausted
than
by
a
hard
day
s
stalking
at
gjendin
and
not
half
so
much
satisfied
with
our
achievements
it
is
almost
unnecessary
to
mention
that
we
found
at
the
hotel
a
note
from
the
skipper
begging
us
to
bring
home
a
waterproof
sheet
and
a
few
clothes
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
leave
there
we
think
that
this
young
man
must
have
shed
nearly
all
his
raiment
before
leaving
norway
and
gone
home
clad
in
a
yellow
ulster
which
we
know
he
had
left
at
the
hotel
in
july
for
judging
from
the
fragments
that
we
have
picked
up
from
time
to
time
on
our
homeward
route
he
can
not
have
much
other
property
with
him
except
his
gun
rifle
and
chapter
xxxvi
home
again
our
norwegian
friends
who
lent
us
the
hut
at
rus
vand
came
to
dine
with
us
and
then
saw
us
safely
aboard
the
angelo
and
at
five
o
clock
in
the
presence
of
an
immense
crowd
which
covered
the
whole
quay
some
of
the
people
cheering
but
many
more
weeping
we
steamed
out
of
the
harbour
as
the
sound
of
the
last
bell
died
away
and
the
last
gangway
fell
with
a
crash
on
to
the
a
hatless
breathless
man
rushed
up
the
companion
and
darted
at
the
spot
where
he
supposed
the
gangway
to
be
seeing
that
he
was
too
late
he
yelled
to
the
people
on
shore
and
made
as
though
he
would
have
cast
himself
into
the
water
but
was
restrained
by
the
passengers
meanwhile
a
fleet
of
little
boats
endeavoured
to
catch
a
rope
and
be
towed
until
he
could
be
lowered
into
one
of
them
but
all
failed
and
the
unfortunate
man
was
carried
off
to
christiansand
so
that
on
his
involuntary
voyage
he
would
have
leisure
to
meditate
on
the
folly
of
a
too
prolonged
farewell
with
a
gentle
breeze
we
steamed
down
the
fjord
which
never
looked
more
lovely
than
on
this
evening
and
so
beautiful
was
the
night
so
warm
so
radiant
and
with
such
a
depth
of
glorious
colouring
from
the
departed
sun
that
people
crept
away
into
the
shade
out
of
the
from
pure
force
of
habit
after
the
heat
of
the
summer
the
influence
of
such
a
night
together
with
a
certain
sense
of
something
completed
the
calm
ocean
all
round
us
and
the
soothing
monotonous
throbbing
of
the
untiring
screw
produced
a
longing
for
confidence
in
john
s
bosom
so
that
he
gave
utterance
to
his
sentiments
as
he
leant
with
esau
over
the
rail
of
the
hurricane
deck
and
watched
the
phosphorescent
lights
caused
by
the
passage
of
the
vessel
through
the
quiet
water
yes
i
m
sorry
to
be
leaving
norway
for
you
know
there
s
something
delightful
to
me
about
the
simplicity
of
the
people
esau
s
mind
reverted
to
ivar
tofte
and
his
plate
cupboard
they
seem
to
place
a
childlike
confidence
in
a
stranger
which
is
quite
incomprehensible
to
me
then
there
is
an
unwordable
calm
an
indescribable
tranquillity
which
seems
to
cling
both
to
the
country
and
its
inhabitants
even
the
houses
seem
to
possess
an
imperturbable
serenity
of
demeanour
which
you
will
not
find
on
any
other
island
in
europe
in
fact
y
know
esau
it
s
a
country
where
one
might
live
quietly
and
die
in
peace
where
moths
do
not
corrupt
neither
do
worms
break
through
and
steal
don
t
you
know
esau
and
i
m
deuced
sorry
to
have
to
count
among
past
memories
the
time
we
have
spent
here
where
the
unbroken
harmony
of
existence
is
that
repose
for
which
my
soul
has
longed
these
many
years
but
never
until
now
no
by
george
never
has
it
been
able
to
discover
the
most
uncertain
tracings
of
its
here
esau
who
had
his
deck
shoes
on
seeing
what
sort
of
a
mood
john
was
in
stole
away
quietly
towards
the
cabin
and
left
him
prosing
on
to
the
german
ocean
he
paused
however
a
moment
before
descending
the
companion
stairs
and
caught
a
few
more
words
which
as
the
moon
had
now
set
john
was
confiding
to
the
darkness
a
couple
more
days
and
we
shall
be
back
in
england
where
y
know
i
think
civilisation
is
overdone
my
existence
there
is
a
perpetual
state
of
toadying
and
being
toadied
you
see
it
s
a
place
where
the
serpent
of
social
emulation
creeps
into
our
very
beds
and
hangs
suspended
over
our
heads
by
a
mere
thread
when
we
least
expect
him
and
y
know
esau
but
esau
had
slunk
down
the
stairs
and
the
rest
of
this
impassioned
outburst
is
we
fear
lost
to
humanity
we
woke
up
to
find
ourselves
just
leaving
christiansand
and
soon
reached
the
lighthouse
at
what
the
skipper
calls
the
bottom
corner
of
norway
but
remained
in
bed
while
we
glared
at
it
through
the
port
we
were
taking
out
a
great
number
of
emigrants
for
america
fine
young
fellows
probably
as
hard
as
nails
and
quite
equal
to
coping
with
the
difficulties
of
a
new
country
they
all
looked
so
cheery
and
full
of
hope
and
expectation
that
we
could
not
help
thinking
rather
sadly
of
the
day
when
they
will
wake
up
to
some
of
the
unpleasant
realities
of
yankee
life
and
wish
themselves
back
again
in
their
native
hills
among
their
own
friends
the
day
passed
in
the
manner
usual
at
sea
when
the
water
is
smooth
and
the
ship
goes
merrily
homeward
bound
hardly
any
one
missed
a
meal
rather
a
difference
from
the
ordinary
state
of
affairs
in
the
wild
north
sea
and
at
evening
the
sun
went
down
in
a
blaze
of
scarlet
and
gold
which
was
reflected
from
the
perfectly
calm
surface
and
we
turned
in
with
tranquil
minds
even
esau
being
now
reasonably
hopeful
of
seeing
the
humber
without
suffering
the
pangs
of
starvation
esau
is
not
a
good
sailor
on
the
last
occasion
of
our
return
from
norway
he
crossed
by
the
angelo
a
fortnight
before
the
skipper
and
the
latter
on
arriving
on
board
prepared
for
the
voyage
saw
the
steward
and
asked
him
what
sort
of
a
passage
did
you
have
last
trip
george
beautiful
sir
i
never
see
a
smoother
then
the
skipper
went
on
did
you
see
anything
of
esau
on
the
voyage
to
which
george
replied
i
seen
him
come
and
this
brief
remark
of
george
s
conveyed
a
world
of
untold
fact
we
dropped
anchor
outside
hull
at
five
this
evening
in
the
remainder
of
the
very
same
drizzling
rain
that
was
going
on
when
we
left
england
in
july
hull
on
sunday
in
a
soaking
rain
is
not
a
place
to
grow
romantic
about
so
we
omit
all
reference
to
our
first
sensations
and
maledictions
on
our
return
to
our
native
climate
and
proceed
to
a
more
agreeable
subject
dinner
it
was
a
merry
meal
in
company
with
four
of
our
who
were
likewise
returning
from
sport
in
norway
two
from
salmon
fishing
two
from
stalking
and
with
whom
there
was
consequently
a
bond
of
sympathy
with
these
kindred
spirits
after
british
beef
had
been
washed
down
with
british
beer
a
skaal
drunk
in
british
champagne
and
tongues
were
loosened
by
the
confidential
pipe
and
british
cigar
we
chatted
long
and
pleasantly
wandering
again
with
rod
and
gun
among
the
rugged
mountains
of
that
wild
north
land
recalling
exploits
performed
and
perhaps
indulging
in
those
mild
and
harmless
exaggerations
of
doughty
deeds
which
no
traveller
or
sportsman
can
resist
already
we
found
ourselves
forgetting
the
few
disagreeable
incidents
that
occurred
during
our
trip
and
viewing
everything
through
that
rosy
mist
which
happily
arises
before
all
past
hours
of
pleasure
and
discomfort
alike
too
soon
bedtime
put
an
end
to
our
retrospect
and
we
slept
the
sleep
of
the
wearied
traveller
with
dreams
of
trout
ryper
and
reindeer
steamboat
cariole
and
