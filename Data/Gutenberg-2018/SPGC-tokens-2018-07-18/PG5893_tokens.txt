a
wonderful
plan
hello
dolly
said
dotty
rose
over
the
telephone
hello
dot
responded
dolly
fayre
what
you
want
oh
i
ca
tell
you
this
way
come
on
over
just
as
quick
as
you
can
but
i
have
finished
my
algebra
and
it
nearly
dinner
time
anyway
no
it
is
and
no
matter
if
it
is
come

i
tell
you
you

fast
enough
if
you
knew
what
it
about
tell
me
then
i
say
i
ca
over
the
telephone
oh
dolly
come
on
and
stop
fussing
the
telephone
receiver
at
dotty
end
of
the
wire
was
hung
up
with
a
click
and
dolly
began
to
waggle
her
receiver
hook
in
hope
of
getting
dotty
back
but
there
was
no
response
so
dolly
rose
and
went
for
her
coat
flinging
it
round
her
and
not
stopping
to
get
a
hat
she
ran
next
door
to
dotty
rose
house
it
was
mid
january
and
the
six
darkness
was
lighted
only
by
the
street
lights
flying
across
the
two
lawns
that
divided
the
houses
dolly
found
dotty
awaiting
her
at
the
side
door
hurry
up
in
doll
she
cried
eagerly
the
greatest
thing
you
ever
heard
oh
the
very
greatest
if
you
only
can
oh
if
you
only
can
can
what
do
tell
me
what
you
talking
about
dolly
tossed
her
coat
on
the
hall
rack
and
followed
dotty
into
the
roses
there
she
found
dotty
parents
and
also
bernice
forbes
and
her
father
what
could
such
a
gathering
mean
dolly
began
to
think
of
school
happenings
had
she
cut
up
any
mischievous
pranks
or
inadvertently
done
anything
wrong
what
else
could
bring
forbes
to
the
roses
on
what
was
very
evidently
an
important
errand
for
all
present
were
eagerly
interested
that
much
was
clear
and
rose
were
smiling
yet
shaking
their
heads
in
uncertainty
bernice
was
flushed
and
excited
and
forbes
himself
was
apparently
trying
to
persuade
them
to
something
he
was
proposing
this
much
dolly
gathered
before
she
heard
a
word
of
the
discussion
then
rose
said
here
dolly
fayre
you
tell
her
about
it
mr
forbes
oh
let
me
tell
her
cried
bernice
no
said
rose
let
her
hear
it
first
from
your
father
you
girls
can
chatter
afterward
so
forbes
spoke
my
dear
child
he
said
to
dolly
my
bernice
is
invited
to
spend
a
week
with
her
uncle
in
new
york
city
she
is
privileged
to
ask
you
two
girls
to
accompany
her
if
you
care
to
dolly
listened
without
quite
grasping
the
idea
she
was
slow
of
thought
though
far
from
stupid
and
this
was
such
a
sudden
and
startling
suggestion
that
she
could
quite
take
it
in
go
to
new
york
for
a
week
oh
i
could
i
have
to
go
to
school
rose
smiled
that
just
the
trouble
dolly
dot
has
to
go
to
school
too
at
least
she
ought
to
bernice
likewise
but
this
invitation
is
so
delightful
and
so
unusual
that
i
thinking
you
three
girls
ought
to
take
advantage
of
it
the
question
is
what
will
your
parents
say
oh
they
never
let
me
go
exclaimed
dolly
decidedly
they
want
anything
to
interfere
with
my
lessons
no
and
we
feel
the
same
way
about
dotty
but
an
exceptional
case
must
be
considered
in
an
exceptional
manner
i
think
your
people
might
be
persuaded
if
we
go
about
it
in
the
right
way
i
do
believe
so
and
dolly
looked
very
dubious
tell
me
more
about
it
oh
doll
it
just
gorgeous
broke
in
bernice
uncle
jeff
father
brother
wants
me
to
spend
a
week
with
him
and
he
going
to
have
my
cousin
alicia
there
at
the
same
time
and
he
wants
us
to
bring
two
other
girls
and
alicia
ca
bring
one
she
at
boarding
school
and
none
of
the
girls
can
get
leave
that
is
none
that
she
wants
so
uncle
said
for
me
to
get
two
if
i
could
and
i
want
you
and
dot
a
whole
week
in
new
york
visiting
dolly
eyes
sparkled
as
the
truth
began
to
dawn
on
her
oh
i
wish
i
could
coax
mother
into
it
i
never
been
to
new
york
to
stay
any
time
only
just
for
the
day
how
lovely
of
you
bernie
to
ask
us
there
no
one
else
i
rather
have
but
if
you
ca
go
i
have
to
ask
maisie
may
i
must
get
two
are
you
going
anyway
dots
i
do
know
i
want
to
go
terribly
but
i
do
want
to
go
without
you
dolly
oh
wo
your
mother
let
you
the
only
way
to
find
out
is
to
ask
her
said
forbes
smiling
suppose
i
go
over
there
now
and
ask
shall
i
go
alone
or
take
you
three
chatterboxes
along
oh
let
us
go
and
dotty
sprang
up
we
can
coax
and
you
can
tell
about
the
arrangements
very
well
agreed
forbes
come
along
then
so
the
four
went
across
to
the
fayre
house
and
found
the
rest
of
dolly
family
gathered
in
the
library
here
is
forbes
daddy
said
dolly
as
they
entered
and
fayre
and
trudy
dolly
older
sister
greeted
the
visitor
cordially
and
looked
with
smiling
inquiry
at
the
eager
faces
of
the
three
girls
dolly
went
and
sat
on
the
arm
of
her
mother
chair
and
putting
an
arm
around
her
whispered
oh
mumsie
please
please
do
say
yes
oh
please
do
yes
to
what
returned
fayre
patting
her
daughter
shoulder
forbes
will
tell
you
listen
it
this
way
my
dear
people
began
forbes
he
was
a
man
with
an
impressive
manner
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
about
to
make
a
speech
of
grave
importance
as
indeed
from
the
girls
point
of
view
he
was
my
brother
jefferson
who
lives
in
new
york
has
invited
my
daughter
to
spend
a
week
in
his
home
there
he
has
asked
also
another
niece
miss
alicia
steele
he
wants
these
girl
visitors
to
bring
with
them
two
friends
and
as
alicia
does
not
wish
to
avail
herself
of
that
privilege
bernice
may
take
two
with
her
she
wants
to
take
dotty
and
dolly
there
that
the
whole
story
in
a
nutshell
the
question
is
may
dolly
go
when
is
this
visit
to
be
made
asked
fayre
as
soon
as
convenient
for
all
concerned
my
brother
would
like
the
girls
to
come
some
day
next
week
and
remain
one
week
what
about
school
and
fayre
looked
decidedly
disapproving
of
the
plan
that
just
it
exclaimed
dotty
we
knew
you
say
that
but
fayre
my
mother
says
this
is
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
almost
and
we
ought
we
really
ought
to
take
advantage
of
it
but
to
be
out
of
school
for
a
whole
week
and
what
with
getting
ready
and
getting
home
and
settled
again
it
would
mean
more
than
a
week
but
mother
we
could
make
up
our
lessons
pleaded
dolly
and
i
do
want
to
go
oh
i
do
want
to
go
just
awfully
i
should
think
you
would
put
in
trudy
let
her
go
mother
it
be
an
education
in
itself
the
visit
will
why
the
girls
can
go
to
the
museums
and
art
galleries
and
see
all
sorts
of
things
of
course
we
can
said
bernice
and
my
uncle
has
a
beautiful
house
and
motor
cars
and
everything
that
another
point
said
fayre
gravely
you
must
realise
forbes
that
my
little
girl
is
not
accustomed
to
grandeur
and
wealth
i
do
want
her
to
enjoy
it
so
much
that
she
will
come
back
discontented
with
her
own
plain
home
oh
nonsense
my
dear
sir
a
glimpse
of
city
life
and
a
taste
of
frivolity
will
do
your
girl
good
dolly
is
too
sensible
a
sort
to
be
a
prey
to
envy
or
discontent
i
know
dolly
fairly
well
and
i
can
vouch
for
her
common
sense
so
can
i
said
bernice
doll
will
enjoy
everything
to
the
limit
but
it
wo
hurt
her
disposition
or
upset
her
happiness
to
see
the
sights
of
the
city
for
a
short
time
oh
please
fayre
do
let
her
go
just
as
her
mother
thinks
and
fayre
smiled
at
the
insistent
bernice
tell
me
of
the
household
said
fayre
is
your
brother
wife
living
jeff
has
never
been
married
replied
forbes
he
is
an
elderly
bachelor
and
i
think
is
a
bit
lonely
now
and
then
but
he
is
also
a
little
eccentric
he
desires
no
company
usually
it
is
most
extraordinary
that
he
should
ask
these
girls
but
i
think
he
wants
to
see
his
two
nieces
and
he
fears
he
can
not
entertain
them
pleasantly
unless
they
have
other
companions
of
their
own
age
and
who
would
look
after
the
girls
berry
my
brother
housekeeper
she
is
a
fine
and
competent
woman
who
has
kept
his
house
for
years
i
know
her
and
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
trust
bernice
to
her
care
she
will
chaperon
the
young
people
for
i
doubt
if
my
brother
will
go
to
many
places
with
them
but
he
will
want
them
to
have
the
best
possible
time
and
will
give
them
all
the
pleasure
possible
that
part
of
it
is
all
right
then
smiled
fayre
it
is
to
my
mind
only
the
loss
of
more
than
a
week
of
the
school
work
that
presents
the
insuperable
objection
oh
do
say
insuperable
urged
forbes
ca
you
bring
yourself
to
permit
that
loss
as
dolly
says
the
girls
can
make
up
their
lessons
they
can
but
will
they
i
will
mother
cried
dolly
i
promise
you
i
will
study
each
day
while
i
in
new
york
then
i
can
recite
out
of
school
hours
after
i
get
back
and
i
get
my
marks
all
the
same
but
dolly
dear
you
ca
study
while
you
are
in
new
york
there
would
be
too
much
to
distract
you
and
occupy
your
time
oh
no
fayre
observed
bernice
we
could
be
all
the
time
sightseeing
i
think
it
would
be
fine
for
all
us
girls
to
study
every
day
and
keep
up
our
lessons
that
way
it
sounds
well
my
dear
child
and
fayre
looked
doubtfully
at
bernice
and
i
daresay
you
mean
to
do
it
but
i
ca
think
you
could
keep
it
up
the
very
spirit
of
your
life
there
would
be
all
against
study
i
agree
with
that
said
forbes
decidedly
i
vote
for
the
girls
having
an
entire
holiday
lessons
each
day
would
spoil
all
their
fun
they
could
do
it
trudy
said
i
know
however
much
they
tried
they
just
could
study
in
that
atmosphere
why
not
asked
bernice
we
not
young
ladies
like
you
trudy
we
wo
be
going
to
parties
and
such
things
we
can
only
go
to
the
shops
and
the
exhibitions
and
for
motor
rides
in
the
park
and
such
things
we
could
study
evenings
i
sure
it
is
only
the
lessons
fayre
said
but
i
ca
feel
quite
willing
to
let
my
little
girl
go
away
for
a
week
without
me
her
pleasant
smile
at
forbes
robbed
the
words
of
any
reflection
they
might
seem
to
cast
on
his
brother
invitation
i
sure
berry
would
do
all
that
is
necessary
in
the
way
of
a
chaperon
duties
but
these
girls
are
pretty
young
even
for
that
they
need
a
oversight
fayre
was
about
to
say
a
mother
oversight
when
she
remembered
that
bernice
had
no
mother
and
changed
the
words
accordingly
there
was
some
further
discussion
and
then
fayre
said
she
must
have
a
little
time
alone
to
make
up
her
mind
she
knew
that
if
dolly
did
not
go
maisie
may
would
be
asked
in
her
place
but
she
still
felt
undecided
she
asked
for
only
an
hour
or
two
to
think
it
over
and
promised
to
telephone
directly
after
dinner
and
tell
forbes
her
final
decision
this
was
the
only
concession
she
would
make
if
not
acceptable
then
her
answer
must
be
no
please
do
not
judge
my
wife
too
harshly
said
fayre
as
he
accompanied
forbes
and
bernice
to
the
door
she
still
looks
upon
dolly
as
her
baby
and
scarcely
lets
her
out
of
her
sight
that
all
right
returned
forbes
she
the
right
sort
of
a
mother
for
the
girl
i
hope
she
will
decide
to
let
dolly
go
but
if
not
i
quite
understand
her
hesitancy
and
i
respect
and
admire
her
for
it
bernice
can
take
somebody
else
and
i
trust
you
will
not
try
over
hard
to
influence
fayre
in
dolly
favour
if
anything
untoward
should
happen
i
should
never
forgive
myself
i
would
far
rather
the
children
were
disappointed
than
to
have
fayre
persuaded
against
her
better
judgment
the
forbeses
departed
and
then
dotty
rose
went
home
too
oh
dollyrinda
she
whispered
as
they
stood
in
the
hall
do
you
your
mother
ever
say
yes
i
do
believe
so
replied
dolly
mournfully
but
oh
dot
how
i
do
want
to
go
seems
i
never
wanted
anything
so
much
in
all
my
life
you
do
want
to
go
a
bit
more
than
i
want
to
have
you
why
dollops
i
sha
go
if
you
do
oh
yes
you
will
dotty
you
must
it
would
be
silly
not
to
but
i
could
i
just
could
do
you
i
could
have
one
single
bit
of
fun
going
to
places
without
you
and
knowing
you
were
here
at
home
longing
to
be
with
us
i
just
could
so
just
you
remember
that
old
girl
no
dolly
no
dotty
and
that
sure
there
was
a
ring
in
dotty
voice
that
proclaimed
an
unshakable
determination
and
dolly
knew
it
she
knew
that
no
coaxing
of
bernice
or
even
of
dolly
herself
could
make
dotty
go
without
her
chum
for
chums
these
two
were
in
the
deepest
sense
of
the
word
they
were
together
all
that
was
possible
during
their
waking
hours
they
studied
together
worked
and
played
together
and
occupied
together
their
little
house
built
for
them
and
called
treasure
house
dolly
knew
she
could
enjoy
going
anywhere
without
dotty
and
she
knew
dot
felt
the
same
way
about
her
but
this
was
such
a
big
splendid
opportunity
that
she
hated
to
have
dotty
miss
it
even
if
she
go
herself
the
two
girls
said
and
dolly
went
back
to
her
family
in
the
library
i
hate
terribly
to
disappoint
you
dolly
darling
began
her
mother
and
the
tears
welled
up
in
dolly
blue
eyes
this
beginning
meant
a
negative
decision
that
was
self
evident
but
dolly
fayre
was
plucky
by
nature
and
she
was
not
the
sort
that
whines
at
disappointment
all
right
she
said
striving
to
be
cheerful
and
blinking
her
eyes
quickly
to
keep
those
tears
back
now
look
here
edith
said
fayre
i
do
believe
i
can
stand
this
i
do
differ
with
you
regarding
the
children
but
i
do
think
you
might
let
dolly
go
on
this
party
even
if
it
does
take
a
week
out
of
school
she
get
enough
general
information
and
experience
from
a
week
in
the
city
to
make
up
that
just
it
will
but
the
experiences
she
gets
there
may
not
be
the
best
possible
for
a
little
girl
of
fifteen
oh
fifteen
is
an
absolute
baby
remember
dear
dolly
is
going
to
grow
up
some
day
and
she
getting
started
and
another
thing
i
asked
forbes
a
few
questions
while
you
were
talking
to
bernice
and
it
seems
this
other
girl
the
niece
alicia
is
attending
a
very
fashionable
girls
boarding
school
well
what
of
that
you
speak
as
if
she
were
attending
a
lunatic
asylum
no
but
ca
you
see
if
dolly
goes
to
stay
a
week
with
wealthy
bernice
forbes
and
this
fashionable
alicia
she
get
her
head
full
of
all
sorts
of
notions
that
do
belong
there
no
i
wo
mother
murmured
dolly
who
again
on
her
mother
arm
chair
was
looking
earnestly
into
the
maternal
blue
eyes
so
like
her
own
and
very
lovingly
fayre
returned
the
gaze
for
she
adored
her
little
daughter
and
was
actuated
only
by
the
best
motives
in
making
her
decisions
and
here
another
thing
said
dolly
dot
wo
go
if
i
do
it
seems
too
bad
to
spoil
her
fun
oh
yes
she
will
said
fayre
smiling
she
would
be
foolish
to
give
up
her
pleasure
just
because
you
ca
share
it
foolish
or
not
she
wo
go
repeated
dolly
i
know
my
dot
and
when
she
says
she
wo
do
a
thing
she
just
simply
does
do
it
i
be
sorry
to
be
the
means
of
keeping
dotty
at
home
and
fayre
sighed
deeply
chapter
ii
a
favourable
decision
all
through
dinner
time
fayre
was
somewhat
silent
her
eyes
resting
on
dolly
with
a
wistful
uncertain
expression
she
wanted
to
give
the
child
the
pleasure
she
craved
but
she
had
hard
work
to
bring
herself
to
the
point
of
overcoming
her
own
objections
at
last
however
when
the
meal
was
nearly
over
she
smiled
at
her
little
daughter
and
said
all
right
dolly
you
may
go
oh
mother
dolly
cried
overwhelmed
with
sudden
delight
really
oh
i
am
so
glad
are
you
sure
you
willing
i
persuaded
myself
to
be
willing
against
my
will
returned
fayre
whimsically
i
confess
i
just
hate
to
have
you
go
but
i
bear
to
deprive
you
of
the
pleasure
trip
and
as
you
say
it
would
also
keep
dotty
at
home
and
so
altogether
i
think
i
shall
have
to
give
in
oh
you
angel
mother
you
blessed
lady
how
good
you
are
and
dolly
flew
around
the
table
and
gave
her
mother
a
hug
that
nearly
suffocated
her
there
there
dollygirl
said
her
father
go
back
and
finish
your
pudding
while
we
talk
this
over
a
bit
are
you
sure
edith
you
are
willing
i
do
want
you
to
feel
miserable
and
anxious
all
the
week
dolly
is
cut
loose
from
your
apron
string
no
will
it
all
right
if
you
and
the
roses
and
trudy
here
all
agree
it
best
for
dolly
to
go
it
seems
foolish
for
me
to
object
and
it
may
be
for
her
good
after
all
that
what
i
say
mother
put
in
trudy
doll
is
a
child
exactly
she
fifteen
and
a
half
and
it
will
be
a
fine
experience
for
her
to
see
a
little
bit
of
the
great
world
and
she
could
do
it
under
better
conditions
than
at
forbes
brother
the
forbes
are
a
fine
family
and
you
know
perfectly
well
there
be
nothing
there
that
is
just
exactly
right
it
is
that
trudy
but
oh
i
do
know
i
daresay
i
a
foolish
mother
bird
afraid
of
her
littlest
fledgling
you
a
lovely
cried
dolly
and
not
foolish
a
bit
but
oh
do
decide
positively
for
i
ca
wait
another
minute
to
tell
dot
if
i
going
very
well
said
fayre
run
along
and
tell
dotty
and
bernice
too
dolly
made
a
jump
and
two
hops
for
the
telephone
and
soon
the
wires
must
have
bent
under
the
weight
of
joyous
exclamations
oh
dolly
is
it
fine
oh
dotty
it
splendid
i
can
hardly
believe
it
have
you
told
bernice
not
yet
had
to
tell
you
first
when
do
we
go
next
tuesday
i
think
now
you
tell
bernie
so
she
can
write
to
her
uncle
that
we
accept
and
then
there
was
another
jubilation
over
the
telephone
fine
cried
bernice
as
she
heard
the
news
lovely
i
so
much
rather
have
you
two
girls
than
any
others
i
write
uncle
jeff
that
i
bring
you
and
i
come
over
and
decide
what
clothes
to
take
and
all
that
fayre
sighed
as
dolly
reported
this
conversation
you
girls
ca
do
a
bit
of
serious
study
all
the
rest
of
the
time
before
you
go
she
said
now
dolly
i
have
to
ask
you
to
do
your
lessons
every
day
before
you
plan
or
talk
over
the
trip
at
all
yes
mother
i
will
and
dolly
started
at
once
for
her
schoolbooks
it
was
hard
work
to
put
her
mind
on
her
studies
with
the
wonderful
possibilities
that
lay
ahead
of
her
but
she
was
exceedingly
conscientious
was
dolly
fayre
and
she
resolutely
put
the
subject
of
the
new
york
visit
out
of
her
mind
and
did
her
algebra
examples
with
diligence
not
so
dotty
rose
after
dolly
telephone
message
she
flung
her
schoolbooks
aside
with
a
shout
of
joy
and
declared
she
could
study
that
night
i
do
wonder
laughed
her
father
why
dot
you
going
on
a
veritable
visit
you
are
quite
justified
in
being
excited
over
it
i
thought
you
and
dolly
did
like
bernice
forbes
very
much
said
rose
we
did
use
to
mother
but
lately
she
been
a
whole
lot
nicer
you
know
doll
made
her
sort
of
popular
and
after
that
she
helped
along
herself
by
being
ever
so
much
more
pleasant
and
chummy
with
us
all
she
used
to
be
stuck
up
and
disagreeable
ostentatious
about
being
rich
and
all
that
but
nowadays
she
more
simple
and
more
agreeable
every
way
that
nice
observed
rose
forbes
is
not
a
popular
man
nor
a
very
good
citizen
i
mean
he
is
or
generous
but
he
a
fine
business
man
and
a
man
of
sound
judgment
and
integrity
glad
you
chums
with
his
daughter
dotty
and
you
ought
to
have
a
perfectly
gorgeous
time
on
the
new
york
visit
oh
we
will
daddy
i
sure
of
that
what
about
clothes
mumsie
i
have
to
see
about
that
you
need
a
few
new
frocks
i
suppose
but
we
can
get
them
ready
made
or
get
miss
felton
to
come
for
a
few
days
there
nearly
a
week
before
you
start
i
want
some
nice
things
declared
dotty
you
know
bernice
has
wonderful
clothes
and
i
suppose
her
cousin
has
too
maybe
your
wardrobe
ca
be
as
fine
as
a
rich
man
daughter
said
her
father
smiling
at
her
but
i
hope
mother
will
fix
you
up
so
you
wo
feel
ashamed
of
your
clothes
i
think
they
be
all
right
and
rose
nodded
her
head
see
fayre
and
we
find
out
what
bernice
is
going
to
take
with
her
you
children
ca
need
elaborate
things
but
they
must
be
right
the
rose
family
spent
the
entire
evening
talking
over
the
coming
trip
and
when
dotty
went
to
bed
she
set
an
alarm
clock
that
she
might
rise
early
in
the
morning
to
do
her
lessons
for
the
day
before
breakfast
she
did
them
too
and
came
to
the
table
smiling
in
triumph
did
all
my
examples
and
learned
my
history
perfectly
she
exulted
so
you
see
mother
my
trip
wo
interfere
with
my
education
oh
you
can
make
up
your
lessons
said
her
father
carelessly
i
would
give
much
for
a
girl
who
could
do
a
few
extra
tasks
to
make
up
for
a
grand
outing
such
as
you
to
have
i
either
agreed
dotty
but
the
fayres
are
worried
to
death
for
fear
doll
will
miss
a
lesson
somewhere
dolly
learns
more
slowly
than
you
remarked
her
mother
you
have
a
gift
for
grasping
facts
quickly
and
a
good
memory
to
retain
them
you
ought
to
be
grateful
for
that
said
rose
i
am
returned
dotty
when
i
see
dolly
grubbing
over
her
history
i
ca
understand
how
she
can
be
so
long
over
it
but
she
better
in
mathematics
than
you
are
yes
she
is
she
helps
me
a
lot
with
the
old
puzzlers
she
thinks
we
study
in
new
york
but
somehow
i
do
believe
we
will
of
course
you
wo
laughed
rose
why
you
be
foolish
to
do
that
a
fine
opportunity
has
come
to
you
girls
and
i
advise
you
to
make
the
most
of
it
see
all
the
sights
you
can
go
to
all
the
pleasant
places
you
can
and
have
all
the
fun
you
can
cram
into
your
days
then
go
to
sleep
and
rest
up
for
the
next
day
good
sound
advice
dads
said
dotty
you
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
to
look
at
it
like
that
but
i
do
know
as
we
can
go
about
much
i
believe
forbes
is
quite
an
old
man
and
who
will
take
us
about
i
thought
the
housekeeper
would
said
rose
i
do
know
at
all
mother
it
seems
bernie
has
never
visited
there
before
though
she
has
been
to
the
house
her
uncle
is
queer
and
why
he
wants
his
two
nieces
all
of
a
sudden
and
his
two
nieces
friends
nobody
knows
it
sort
of
mysterious
i
think
well
it
all
right
as
long
as
you
properly
invited
it
seems
strange
bernie
cousin
did
care
to
take
a
friend
yes
i
wonder
what
she
like
bernice
has
seen
her
since
they
were
little
girls
she
lives
out
in
iowa
i
think
she
at
school
in
connecticut
somewhere
it
all
sort
of
unknown
but
i
like
that
part
of
it
i
love
new
experiences
i
always
do
too
dot
said
her
father
i
reckon
when
you
come
home
you
have
lots
to
tell
us
new
york
is
so
strange
to
me
said
dotty
i
been
there
a
lot
of
times
you
know
but
to
go
and
stay
in
a
house
there
that
the
fun
it
so
different
from
going
in
for
a
day
shopping
with
mother
or
the
day
we
all
went
to
the
hippodrome
you
probably
go
to
the
hippodrome
again
or
some
such
entertainment
suggested
rose
i
dunno
i
imagine
the
old
gentleman
does
favour
such
gaiety
and
the
housekeeper
lady
will
likely
be
too
busy
to
do
much
for
us
we
ca
go
anywhere
alone
can
we
i
do
know
replied
rose
you
must
be
guided
by
circumstances
dotty
whatever
forbes
and
berry
say
for
you
to
do
will
be
all
right
make
as
little
trouble
as
you
can
and
do
as
you
told
you
have
fun
enough
just
being
with
the
girls
indeed
i
will
oh
i
so
glad
dolly
can
go
i
would
have
stirred
a
step
without
her
no
i
know
you
would
agreed
her
mother
next
day
at
school
recess
bernice
showed
the
girls
a
letter
she
had
received
from
alicia
you
know
i
have
seen
her
in
years
bernice
said
i
think
she
must
be
more
grown
up
than
we
are
though
she
only
just
sixteen
dearest
bernice
the
letter
ran
is
it
simply
screaming
that
we
to
camp
out
at
uncle
jeff
wildly
excited
over
it
do
you
know
why
he
has
asked
us
i
not
sure
myself
but
i
know
there
a
reason
and
it
a
secret
i
heard
aunt
and
father
talking
about
it
when
i
was
home
at
christmas
time
but
when
i
drifted
into
the
room
they
shut
up
like
clams
however
we
have
one
gay
old
time
think
of
being
in
new
york
a
whole
week
i
do
want
to
take
any
of
the
girls
from
here
for
fear
they
bring
back
tales
do
you
bring
anybody
you
ca
trust
oh
i
laid
lots
of
plans
but
i
wo
tell
you
about
them
till
i
see
you
bring
all
your
best
clothes
and
ask
your
father
for
quite
a
lot
of
money
though
i
suppose
uncle
jeff
will
give
us
some
i
can
scarcely
wait
for
the
time
to
come
devotedly
yours
alicia
what
does
she
mean
by
a
secret
reason
for
your
going
asked
dolly
i
have
an
idea
replied
bernice
my
father
knows
though
quite
sure
he
smiled
at
that
part
of
alicia
letter
but
he
would
tell
me
he
only
said
pshaw
nothing
of
any
consequence
it
very
natural
that
a
lonely
old
bachelor
uncle
should
want
to
see
his
little
girl
nieces
and
it
very
kind
and
thoughtful
of
him
to
ask
you
to
bring
friends
he
says
uncle
jeff
is
not
fond
of
company
and
spends
all
his
time
by
himself
he
a
scientist
or
naturalist
or
something
and
works
in
his
study
all
day
so
dad
says
it
be
fine
for
us
girls
to
have
four
of
us
to
be
company
for
each
other
it
gorgeous
sighed
dotty
in
an
ecstasy
of
anticipation
but
what
does
your
cousin
mean
by
bringing
a
lot
of
money
we
ca
do
that
and
our
parents
do
let
us
spend
much
money
ourselves
anyway
oh
that
be
all
right
said
bernice
carelessly
we
wo
need
much
money
and
if
we
go
to
matinees
or
anything
like
that
of
course
i
pay
if
uncle
jeff
does
you
two
girls
are
my
guests
you
know
you
need
take
any
money
at
all
all
right
said
dolly
and
dismissed
the
subject
money
did
not
figure
very
largely
in
her
affairs
as
except
for
a
small
allowance
for
trifles
she
never
handled
any
nor
did
dotty
as
these
two
were
still
looked
upon
as
children
by
their
parents
but
motherless
bernice
bought
her
own
clothes
and
paid
her
own
bills
and
so
generous
was
her
father
that
there
was
no
stint
and
as
a
consequence
she
too
cared
and
thought
little
about
money
as
a
consideration
i
a
little
scared
of
that
alicia
person
said
dolly
to
dotty
as
they
walked
home
from
school
pooh
i
not
she
no
richer
than
bernie
it
is
that
i
not
afraid
of
rich
people
but
she
seems
so
grown
up
and
well
experienced
well
sixteen
is
grown
up
and
we
getting
there
dolly
i
shall
put
up
my
hair
while
i
in
new
york
why
dot
rose
really
yes
that
is
if
alicia
does
bernice
often
does
you
know
i
know
it
i
ask
mother
if
i
may
goodness
dolly
ca
you
decide
a
thing
like
that
for
yourself
what
would
your
mother
care
i
rather
ask
her
returned
the
conscientious
dolly
fayre
smiled
when
dolly
put
the
question
i
been
expecting
that
she
said
you
better
do
as
the
others
do
dear
if
they
twist
up
their
pigtails
you
do
the
same
i
show
you
how
offered
trudy
if
you
going
to
do
it
you
may
as
well
learn
a
becoming
fashion
so
trudy
taught
her
little
sister
how
to
coil
up
her
yellow
curly
mop
in
a
correct
fashion
and
very
becoming
it
was
to
dolly
but
it
made
her
look
a
year
or
two
older
than
she
was
oh
exclaimed
her
mother
when
she
saw
her
where
my
baby
lost
my
little
girl
just
as
well
said
dolly
delighted
at
her
achievement
and
pirouetting
before
a
mirror
it
time
i
began
to
be
a
little
grown
up
mother
yes
i
suppose
it
is
i
felt
just
the
same
when
trudy
put
up
her
curls
for
the
first
time
i
am
a
foolish
old
thing
now
do
you
talk
like
that
cried
dolly
or
i
pull
down
my
hair
and
wear
it
in
tails
till
i
fifty
no
dear
do
as
you
like
about
it
and
if
you
want
to
wear
it
that
way
while
you
in
new
york
do
it
all
right
more
discussions
came
with
the
new
dresses
fayre
was
for
keeping
to
the
more
youthful
models
but
mrs
hose
felt
that
the
girls
should
have
slightly
older
styles
bernice
frocks
were
almost
young
ladyish
but
those
were
not
copied
dotty
and
dolly
always
had
their
things
similar
different
in
colouring
but
alike
in
style
so
their
respective
mothers
had
many
confabs
before
the
grave
questions
were
settled
and
the
result
was
two
very
attractive
wardrobes
that
were
really
right
for
girls
afternoon
dresses
of
voile
or
thin
silk
and
one
pretty
party
dress
for
each
of
dainty
chiffon
and
lace
morning
frocks
of
linen
and
a
tailored
street
suit
seemed
to
be
ample
in
amount
and
variety
bernice
had
more
and
grander
ones
but
the
two
d
were
entirely
satisfied
and
watched
the
packing
of
their
small
trunks
with
joyful
contentment
dolly
put
in
her
diary
declaring
she
should
write
a
full
account
of
each
day
happenings
then
that
do
for
me
said
dotty
i
hate
to
keep
a
diary
and
what
would
be
the
use
it
would
be
exactly
like
yours
doll
and
i
can
borrow
yours
to
read
to
my
people
after
you
read
it
to
your
family
all
right
agreed
dolly
for
what
pleased
one
girl
usually
suited
the
other
they
did
take
their
schoolbooks
for
it
made
a
heavy
load
and
too
all
agreed
that
it
would
spoil
the
pleasant
vacation
the
girls
promised
to
make
up
the
lessons
on
their
return
and
so
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
marred
the
anticipation
of
their
splendid
holiday
chapter
iii
the
arrival
the
girls
were
put
on
the
train
at
berwick
and
as
berry
was
to
meet
them
at
the
station
in
new
york
they
were
allowed
to
make
the
trip
alone
i
think
this
train
ride
the
best
part
of
the
whole
thing
said
dolly
as
she
took
off
her
coat
and
hung
it
up
beside
her
chair
i
do
love
to
ride
in
a
parlour
car
i
wish
we
were
to
travel
in
it
for
a
week
i
like
it
too
agreed
bernice
oh
girls
what
fun
we
going
to
have
you
wo
like
uncle
jeff
at
first
he
awful
queer
but
one
thing
sure
he
let
us
do
just
as
we
like
he
very
what
berry
like
asked
dotty
i
suppose
we
obey
her
yes
but
she
too
i
can
twist
her
round
my
finger
oh
we
have
a
high
old
time
berry
should
be
there
to
meet
us
when
we
get
in
suggested
dolly
what
then
she
will
of
course
said
bernice
but
if
she
should
if
the
car
broke
down
or
anything
like
that
we
take
a
taxicab
right
to
the
house
this
sounded
very
and
grand
to
the
two
d
who
had
had
little
experience
with
taxicabs
and
dotty
exclaimed
with
glee
i
rather
do
that
than
go
in
forbes
car
what
a
lark
it
would
be
oh
bernice
can
we
go
somewhere
in
a
taxicab
while
we
there
i
do
know
dotty
i
so
but
why
should
we
uncle
jeff
has
two
cars
and
the
chauffeur
will
take
us
wherever
we
want
to
go
but
i
never
been
in
a
taxicab
without
older
people
i
mean
and
i
love
to
try
it
well
i
expect
you
can
returned
bernice
carelessly
i
dare
say
you
can
do
pretty
much
anything
you
want
to
but
do
behave
yourself
dot
cautioned
dolly
you
so
daring
and
venturesome
i
do
know
what
mischief
you
get
into
oh
we
wo
get
into
mischief
laughed
bernice
there
be
enough
fun
without
doing
anything
we
ought
to
of
course
i
wo
do
anything
wrong
declared
dotty
indignantly
but
there
are
so
many
things
to
do
it
sets
me
crazy
to
think
of
it
i
going
to
buy
things
announced
bernice
there
are
any
decent
shops
in
berwick
and
i
going
to
get
lots
of
things
in
the
city
stores
we
ca
do
that
said
dolly
decidedly
we
have
lots
of
money
like
you
have
bernie
i
going
to
see
things
i
want
to
see
all
the
pictures
i
possibly
can
i
love
to
look
at
pictures
i
want
to
go
to
the
theatre
and
dotty
looked
at
bernice
inquiringly
will
we
do
you
oh
yes
berry
will
take
us
perhaps
we
can
go
to
matinees
alone
i
do
think
we
ought
to
do
that
and
dolly
looked
distinctly
disapproving
oh
come
now
old
said
dotty
do
be
too
awfully
it
will
be
just
as
berry
says
bernice
informed
them
father
said
i
must
obey
her
in
everything
uncle
jeff
wo
pay
much
attention
to
what
we
do
but
berry
will
i
wonder
if
alicia
will
be
there
when
we
get
there
but
alicia
was
as
the
girls
came
up
the
stairs
into
the
great
station
they
saw
a
smiling
lady
waiting
to
welcome
them
here
you
are
she
cried
and
it
was
necessary
for
bernice
to
introduce
her
friends
except
to
tell
which
was
which
i
feel
as
if
i
knew
you
berry
said
and
her
kindly
grey
eyes
beamed
at
them
both
now
i
must
learn
to
tell
you
apart
dolly
with
golden
hair
dotty
with
black
is
that
it
is
alicia
here
asked
bernice
eagerly
no
she
coming
in
at
the
other
station
she
wo
arrive
for
an
hour
or
more
where
are
your
checks
let
george
take
them
the
footman
took
the
checks
and
looked
after
them
while
berry
piloted
the
girls
to
the
waiting
it
was
a
large
and
very
beautiful
limousine
and
they
all
got
in
and
were
soon
rolling
up
fifth
avenue
how
splendid
it
all
is
exclaimed
dolly
looking
out
at
the
crowds
it
seems
as
if
we
must
get
all
snarled
up
in
the
traffic
but
we
do
kirke
is
a
very
careful
driver
said
berry
and
he
understands
just
where
to
go
how
you
grown
bernice
i
have
seen
you
for
two
years
you
know
yes
i
have
we
all
getting
to
be
berry
alicia
i
do
know
i
have
seen
her
for
a
long
time
but
she
at
a
very
fashionable
school
so
i
suppose
she
is
full
of
notions
what
are
notions
asked
dolly
smiling
up
into
the
speaker
eyes
oh
notions
and
berry
laughed
well
it
thinking
you
know
it
all
yourself
and
not
being
willing
to
listen
to
advice
i
believe
you
have
notions
dolly
no
she
has
said
bernice
but
dotty
and
i
have
however
i
promised
dad
i
obey
you
berry
in
everything
you
say
so
i
do
believe
you
have
any
trouble
with
us
land
no
i
do
expect
any
now
let
me
see
i
two
big
rooms
for
you
all
with
two
beds
in
each
i
suppose
you
room
with
your
cousin
bernice
and
these
other
two
girls
together
yes
indeed
said
dolly
quickly
for
she
had
no
idea
of
rooming
with
any
one
but
dotty
that
settles
itself
then
but
suppose
i
do
like
alicia
said
bernice
doubtfully
suppose
we
quarrel
all
right
and
berry
nodded
her
head
there
are
other
rooms
i
do
want
you
to
be
uncomfortable
in
any
particular
i
thought
like
it
better
that
way
the
two
rooms
i
fixed
for
you
are
two
big
ones
on
the
second
floor
mine
is
on
the
same
floor
in
the
rear
your
uncle
rooms
are
upon
the
third
floor
i
think
it
sounds
fine
declared
bernice
and
i
sure
i
get
on
with
alicia
if
she
does
have
and
then
they
reached
the
big
house
on
upper
fifth
avenue
and
as
they
entered
dolly
felt
a
little
appalled
at
the
grandeur
everywhere
about
her
not
so
dotty
she
loved
elegance
and
as
her
feet
sank
into
the
deep
soft
rugs
she
laughed
out
in
sheer
delight
of
being
in
such
beautiful
surroundings
berry
took
the
girls
at
once
to
their
rooms
and
sent
the
car
for
alicia
i
give
the
front
room
to
dotty
and
dolly
she
said
to
bernice
and
you
can
have
the
other
it
quite
as
nice
only
it
looks
out
on
the
side
street
not
on
the
avenue
that
right
berry
dot
and
dolly
are
more
company
than
alicia
and
i
are
we
really
members
of
the
family
i
was
so
surprised
at
uncle
jeff
inviting
us
why
did
he
do
it
anyway
why
indeed
said
berry
but
her
expression
was
quizzical
no
one
can
tell
why
forbes
does
things
he
is
a
law
unto
himself
now
girls
your
trunks
are
coming
up
and
here
are
two
maids
to
unpack
for
you
and
put
your
things
away
you
can
direct
them
berry
bustled
away
and
two
maids
appeared
one
of
whom
entered
bernice
room
and
the
other
attended
on
dot
and
dolly
which
frocks
shall
i
leave
out
for
dinner
the
maid
asked
as
she
shook
out
and
hung
up
the
dresses
in
the
wardrobe
the
blue
voile
for
me
replied
dolly
and
er
what
is
your
name
foster
miss
and
she
smiled
at
dolly
gentle
face
and
the
voile
for
me
directed
dotty
you
find
foster
that
our
frocks
are
pretty
much
alike
except
as
to
colour
yes
and
these
patent
leather
pumps
i
daresay
yes
that
right
and
dotty
flung
herself
into
a
big
and
sighed
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
that
she
really
had
a
ladies
maid
to
wait
on
her
dolly
did
take
it
so
easily
she
wanted
to
look
after
her
own
things
as
she
did
at
home
but
dotty
motioned
to
her
not
to
do
so
lest
foster
should
think
them
inexperienced
or
countrified
their
simple
belongings
were
soon
in
place
and
the
two
d
wandered
into
bernice
room
here
everything
was
finery
was
piled
on
beds
and
chairs
and
hats
were
flung
on
top
of
one
another
while
shoes
and
veils
gloves
and
were
scattered
on
the
floor
it
my
fault
laughed
bernice
do
blame
perkins
for
it
hunting
for
a
bracelet
that
has
slipped
out
of
my
jewel
case
somehow
it
must
be
in
this
lot
of
stockings
it
was
but
it
turned
up
at
last
inside
of
a
hat
and
bernice
gave
a
little
squeal
of
relief
that
all
right
then
she
cried
i
would
lose
that
for
worlds
it
a
bangle
father
gave
me
for
christmas
and
it
has
a
diamond
in
the
pendant
all
right
perkins
put
the
things
away
any
place
you
like
but
save
hooks
and
shelves
enough
for
my
cousin
alicia
she
be
in
this
room
with
me
each
large
room
had
what
seemed
to
the
two
little
women
ample
room
for
clothes
but
bernice
had
brought
so
much
more
than
they
did
that
her
things
overflowed
the
space
provided
i
wear
this
for
dinner
she
said
pulling
out
a
light
green
silk
from
a
pile
of
frocks
oh
bernie
exclaimed
dotty
not
that
that
a
party
dress
it
not
exactly
i
more
dressy
ones
but
it
is
a
little
fussy
for
a
quiet
evening
at
home
i
suppose
well
what
shall
i
wear
this
and
dotty
picked
out
a
simple
challie
oh
gracious
no
that
a
morning
frock
i
guess
i
stick
to
the
green
do
you
think
so
perkins
yes
miss
it
a
lovely
gown
the
maid
was
interested
in
the
girls
her
life
in
the
quiet
house
being
usually
most
uneventful
this
sudden
invasion
of
young
people
was
welcomed
by
all
the
servants
and
there
were
many
in
jefferson
forbes
palatial
home
berry
had
engaged
several
extra
ones
to
help
with
the
increased
work
but
the
two
maids
assigned
to
the
girls
were
trusted
and
tried
retainers
and
then
there
was
a
bustle
heard
downstairs
a
peal
of
laughter
and
a
perfect
flood
of
chatter
in
a
high
shrill
voice
and
with
a
bounding
run
up
the
staircase
alicia
burst
into
the
room
where
the
three
girls
were
hello
bernice
old
girl
she
shouted
and
flung
her
arms
around
her
cousin
neck
giving
her
resounding
smacks
on
her
cheek
golly
molly
polly
but
i
glad
to
see
you
again
forgotten
me
have
you
take
a
good
look
your
long
lost
alicia
is
really
she
and
look
who
here
i
bet
a
pig
these
two
stammering
blushing
young
misses
are
the
dolly
and
dotty
but
which
is
which
guess
said
dotty
laughing
as
dolly
stood
dismayed
and
half
frightened
at
this
whirlwind
of
a
girl
all
right
i
guess
lemmesee
dolly
fayre
and
dotty
rose
you
see
i
know
your
names
why
the
fair
one
is
dolly
of
course
and
that
leaves
dotty
to
be
you
right
cried
dotty
and
alicia
flew
to
her
and
grabbed
her
as
enthusiastically
as
she
had
bernice
oh
you
chickabiddy
she
cried
i
foresee
we
shall
be
chums
i
love
towhead
too
but
i
a
little
afraid
of
her
see
her
steely
blue
eyes
even
now
fixed
on
me
in
utter
disapprobation
not
at
all
said
dolly
politely
i
think
you
very
nice
the
calm
demureness
of
this
speech
was
too
much
for
alicia
and
she
went
off
in
peals
of
laughter
oh
you
rich
she
cried
simpully
rich
wo
we
have
fun
afraid
i
love
you
the
other
one
the
black
haired
witch
and
then
dolly
was
treated
to
an
embrace
that
ruffled
her
hair
and
collar
and
came
near
ruffling
her
temper
for
dolly
did
like
such
sudden
familiarity
but
her
good
manners
kept
her
from
showing
her
annoyance
oh
you
do
fool
me
cried
alicia
i
know
you
think
i
awful
too
rambunctious
and
all
that
but
i
used
to
it
at
school
they
call
me
that
awful
alicia
how
that
fine
if
you
like
it
and
i
believe
you
do
laughed
dolly
mind
reader
i
say
bernice
where
am
i
to
put
my
togs
squatted
on
every
available
foot
of
property
in
this
room
i
thought
it
was
to
be
ours
together
but
every
single
bed
in
the
room
is
covered
with
your
rags
i
two
trunks
of
duds
myself
two
trunks
why
did
you
bring
so
much
had
to
have
it
there
lots
of
things
i
carry
around
with
me
beside
clothes
why
i
brought
a
whole
outfit
goodness
alicia
exclaimed
bernice
do
you
think
uncle
jeff
give
us
enough
to
eat
i
take
no
chances
but
it
is
that
it
thusly
say
we
out
of
an
evening
and
on
returning
are
sent
straight
to
how
comforting
to
have
the
necessary
for
a
little
spread
of
our
own
oh
i
tried
it
out
at
school
and
i
can
tell
you
there
something
in
it
but
where
ladies
and
gentlemen
where
i
ask
you
can
i
put
it
bernice
has
all
the
places
full
leave
it
in
your
trunk
suggested
dolly
until
you
want
to
use
it
angel
child
cried
alicia
i
knew
you
had
some
brain
concealed
among
that
mop
of
yellow
silk
floss
i
do
that
same
and
be
thankful
if
my
voracious
cousin
leaves
me
enough
room
for
a
few
scant
and
skimpy
clodings
and
then
as
perkins
unpacked
alicia
trunks
and
foster
came
in
to
help
the
room
really
seemed
incapable
of
holding
all
we
better
get
out
doll
said
dotty
laughing
as
alicia
deposited
an
armful
of
petticoats
and
dressing
jackets
in
her
lap
oh
do
go
i
want
you
to
hold
things
till
i
find
a
place
for
them
and
say
are
your
own
wardrobes
full
no
cried
dolly
just
the
thing
put
your
overflow
in
our
room
we
less
than
a
dozen
dresses
between
us
goodness
gracious
me
oh
you
going
to
buy
a
lot
in
the
city
i
see
no
we
not
said
dolly
who
never
sailed
under
false
colours
we
brought
all
we
had
all
our
best
ones
i
mean
but
we
do
have
things
like
you
and
bernice
you
frank
little
bunch
of
honesty
is
she
the
darling
all
right
neighbours
since
you
insist
i
put
some
seventeen
or
of
my
paris
confections
in
your
empty
cupboards
of
course
alicia
was
exaggerating
but
she
really
did
take
half
a
dozen
frocks
into
the
two
d
room
and
hung
them
in
outspread
fashion
right
over
their
best
costumes
and
now
since
one
good
turn
deserves
another
she
rattled
on
just
toss
my
extra
shoes
and
slippers
into
your
lowest
bureau
drawer
and
my
stockings
into
the
next
one
there
plenty
of
room
so
there
was
by
crowding
the
contents
already
there
but
alicia
was
so
quick
of
motion
and
so
gay
of
speech
that
they
could
refuse
to
let
her
have
her
way
and
too
it
seemed
inevitable
for
there
was
room
for
alicia
things
and
bernie
in
the
same
room
and
the
d
shelves
and
bureau
drawers
showed
much
vacancy
now
what
do
we
wear
this
evening
alicia
asked
tossing
over
her
dresses
this
let
us
say
she
held
up
a
low
necked
evening
gown
of
silk
tissue
no
you
goose
said
bernice
decidedly
your
respected
uncle
would
think
you
were
crazy
here
wear
this
bernice
picked
out
one
of
the
least
ornate
a
pretty
dresden
silk
and
then
the
girls
all
began
to
dress
for
dinner
chapter
iv
a
merry
quartette
ready
for
dinner
girls
sounded
a
cheery
voice
and
berry
came
bustling
in
almost
are
you
try
to
remember
that
forbes
does
like
to
be
kept
waiting
i
scared
to
death
said
bernice
frankly
i
never
know
what
to
say
to
uncle
jeff
anyway
and
being
a
guest
makes
it
all
the
harder
pooh
i
not
afraid
exclaimed
alicia
leave
it
to
me
engineer
the
conversation
and
all
you
girls
need
to
do
is
to
chip
in
now
and
then
alicia
was
a
tall
fair
girl
larger
than
any
of
the
others
she
was
plump
and
and
had
a
breezy
manner
that
was
attractive
because
of
her
smiling
face
she
laughed
a
great
deal
and
seemed
to
have
no
lack
of
and
her
dress
had
many
fluttering
ribbons
of
vivid
pink
and
frills
of
lace
of
an
inexpensive
variety
she
led
the
way
downstairs
calling
out
march
on
march
on
to
victory
and
the
others
followed
the
four
entered
the
and
found
there
a
tall
dignified
gentleman
in
full
evening
dress
he
had
a
handsome
face
though
a
trifle
stern
and
forbidding
of
expression
and
his
closely
trimmed
white
beard
was
short
and
pointed
he
had
large
dark
eyes
which
darted
from
one
girl
to
the
other
as
the
quartette
appeared
h
he
said
this
is
bernice
how
do
you
do
my
dear
how
do
you
do
i
alicia
announced
that
spry
damsel
gaily
and
she
caught
him
by
the
hand
yes
and
very
like
your
mother
my
dear
sister
well
alicia
if
you
possess
half
her
fine
traits
you
make
a
splendid
woman
but
i
doubt
if
you
are
very
much
like
her
except
in
appearance
you
look
to
me
like
a
flibbertigibbet
if
you
know
what
that
is
yes
and
i
am
one
thank
you
uncle
jeff
and
alicia
laughed
gaily
not
at
all
abashed
at
her
uncle
remark
these
are
my
two
friends
from
berwick
uncle
said
bernice
introducing
them
dolly
fayre
and
dotty
rose
you
are
welcome
my
dears
and
the
courteous
old
gentleman
bowed
to
them
with
great
dignity
i
trust
you
can
find
amusement
and
enjoy
your
visit
here
now
let
us
dine
dolly
looked
curiously
at
her
host
as
he
stood
back
and
bowed
the
girls
out
of
the
room
before
he
followed
them
but
dotty
was
so
interested
in
the
surroundings
that
she
gave
no
second
thought
to
forbes
as
she
passed
him
the
was
a
marvel
of
old
time
grandeur
nothing
was
modern
but
the
heavy
black
walnut
sideboard
and
chairs
spoke
of
long
usage
and
old
time
ways
berry
did
not
appear
at
the
table
and
evidently
was
not
expected
as
no
place
was
set
for
her
forbes
sat
at
the
head
and
two
girls
at
either
side
a
important
looking
butler
directed
the
service
and
two
footmen
assisted
everything
was
of
the
best
and
wonderfully
cooked
and
served
but
dolly
and
dotty
could
scarcely
eat
for
the
novelty
and
interest
of
the
scene
come
come
miss
fayre
eat
your
terrapin
counselled
forbes
it
is
not
so
good
cold
oh
gracious
uncle
jeff
exclaimed
the
volatile
alicia
do
call
those
kids
miss
call
dotty
and
dolly
do
ca
remember
which
is
which
declared
her
uncle
looking
at
the
two
d
i
can
remember
the
last
names
because
the
fayre
girl
is
fair
and
the
rose
girl
is
rosy
i
shall
call
them
rosy
and
fairy
i
think
all
right
forbes
and
dolly
smiled
and
dimpled
at
the
pretty
conceit
and
you
two
must
call
me
something
less
formal
he
said
suppose
you
call
me
uncle
forbes
as
you
are
not
really
my
nieces
this
seemed
a
fine
plan
and
was
readily
adopted
and
now
forbes
went
on
i
do
mind
confessing
that
i
no
idea
what
to
do
with
you
girls
by
way
of
entertainment
i
mean
oh
uncle
jeff
said
bernice
it
enough
entertainment
just
to
be
here
in
new
york
for
a
week
why
we
will
have
all
we
can
do
to
see
the
shops
and
the
sights
i
suppose
we
can
go
around
bless
my
soul
yes
of
course
you
can
go
where
you
like
order
the
motors
whenever
you
choose
berry
will
do
all
you
want
her
to
just
tell
her
your
plans
all
i
ask
is
that
i
sha
be
troubled
with
you
during
the
day
why
uncle
cried
alicia
wo
we
see
you
at
all
in
the
daytime
no
i
am
a
very
busy
man
i
can
not
have
my
work
interrupted
by
a
pack
of
foolish
chatterers
whatever
did
you
ask
us
for
alicia
round
face
wore
a
look
of
surprised
inquiry
never
you
mind
miss
i
had
a
very
good
reason
for
asking
you
but
one
does
always
tell
his
reasons
however
i
expect
to
see
you
every
night
at
the
dinner
table
and
for
an
hour
or
so
afterward
in
the
drawing
room
the
rest
of
the
time
you
must
amuse
yourselves
have
you
any
friends
in
new
york
any
of
you
i
have
a
few
said
dotty
as
the
inquiring
glance
turned
in
her
direction
invite
them
to
the
house
when
you
choose
said
forbes
hospitably
if
curtly
oh
no
sir
said
dotty
quickly
they
would
fit
in
forbes
chuckled
you
have
a
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
miss
rosy
why
would
they
fit
in
why
they
plain
people
not
grand
and
elegant
like
you
oho
so
i
grand
and
elegant
am
i
and
are
you
grand
and
elegant
too
dotty
considered
yes
she
said
finally
i
am
while
i
here
very
adaptable
and
while
i
in
new
york
i
mean
to
be
just
as
grand
and
elegant
as
the
house
itself
forbes
burst
into
hearty
laughter
good
for
you
he
cried
when
you
in
rome
do
as
the
romans
do
and
you
fairy
of
the
golden
curls
are
you
going
to
be
grand
also
i
ca
returned
dolly
simply
i
can
only
be
myself
wherever
i
am
but
i
shall
enjoy
all
the
beautiful
things
as
much
as
dotty
again
forbes
laughed
you
a
great
pair
he
said
i
glad
i
discovered
you
and
now
bernice
and
alicia
have
you
any
young
friends
in
town
you
like
to
invite
to
see
you
here
remember
the
house
is
yours
oh
uncle
jeff
cried
alicia
you
are
too
good
do
you
mean
it
can
we
do
just
as
we
like
invite
parties
and
all
that
yes
indeed
why
not
have
the
best
time
possible
and
see
to
it
that
those
two
little
friends
of
yours
have
a
good
time
too
but
wo
you
go
with
us
anywhere
asked
bernice
i
thought
take
us
to
see
places
where
we
ca
go
alone
bless
my
soul
take
a
lot
of
chattering
magpies
sightseeing
no
not
if
i
know
it
berry
will
take
you
and
on
a
pinch
i
might
let
my
secretary
accompany
you
say
to
see
the
downtown
big
buildings
or
the
bright
lights
at
night
oh
do
you
have
a
secretary
asked
alicia
what
he
like
fenn
oh
he
a
good
sort
very
dependable
and
really
accommodating
he
be
of
great
help
to
you
i
sure
what
is
your
business
mr
forbes
asked
dolly
who
was
much
interested
in
this
strange
type
of
man
she
had
never
seen
any
one
like
him
and
he
seemed
to
her
a
sort
of
fairy
godfather
who
waved
his
wand
and
gave
them
all
sorts
of
wonderful
gifts
i
have
any
business
my
dear
my
occupation
and
amusement
is
collecting
specimens
for
my
collection
i
am
an
entomologist
and
ornithologist
if
you
know
what
those
big
words
mean
yes
sir
i
do
and
dolly
smiled
back
at
him
may
we
see
your
collection
i
not
sure
about
that
i
do
show
it
to
everybody
it
is
up
on
the
fourth
floor
of
this
house
and
no
one
is
allowed
up
there
unless
accompanied
by
myself
or
fenn
by
the
way
remember
that
all
of
you
on
no
account
go
up
to
the
fourth
floor
not
that
you
be
likely
to
for
you
have
no
call
above
the
second
floor
where
your
rooms
are
but
this
is
a
special
command
the
house
is
yours
as
i
said
but
that
means
only
this
first
floor
and
the
one
above
it
goodness
me
uncle
jeff
said
alicia
you
need
lay
down
the
law
so
hard
we
not
absolute
babes
to
be
so
strictly
cautioned
and
forbidden
if
you
desire
us
not
to
go
up
the
second
flight
of
stairs
of
course
we
wo
that
right
my
dear
do
but
i
do
lay
it
down
as
a
law
and
it
is
the
only
law
i
shall
impose
on
you
except
for
that
you
can
follow
out
your
own
sweet
wills
but
said
dotty
her
dark
eyes
brilliant
with
the
excitement
of
the
occasion
i
not
always
sure
as
to
what
is
proper
i
want
to
do
just
what
is
right
is
it
correct
for
us
to
go
about
alone
in
your
big
motor
with
your
chauffeur
can
we
go
to
the
art
galleries
and
the
shops
alone
bless
my
soul
i
do
know
the
big
man
looked
absolutely
helpless
surely
you
must
know
such
things
yourselves
what
do
your
mothers
let
you
do
at
home
oh
well
if
you
uncertain
ask
berry
know
she
an
capable
person
and
she
know
all
the
unwritten
laws
about
chaperonage
and
such
things
do
as
she
bids
you
this
was
satisfactory
and
dotty
began
at
once
to
make
plans
for
the
next
day
let
go
to
the
metropolitan
museum
first
she
said
all
right
chimed
in
alicia
we
go
there
in
the
morning
then
but
is
wednesday
and
i
want
to
go
to
a
matinee
in
the
afternoon
ca
we
uncle
jeff
of
course
you
can
tell
fenn
he
see
about
tickets
for
you
just
tell
berry
to
see
fenn
about
it
oh
sighed
the
outspoken
dotty
it
is
just
like
fairyland
tell
fenn
just
as
if
fenn
were
a
magician
he
is
said
forbes
smiling
at
her
enthusiasm
i
could
keep
house
without
fenn
he
my
right
hand
man
for
everything
you
girls
must
claim
too
much
of
his
time
and
attention
for
i
keep
him
on
the
jump
most
of
the
time
myself
does
your
collection
keep
you
so
busy
asked
dolly
whose
secret
longing
was
to
see
that
same
collection
which
greatly
interested
her
yes
indeed
there
always
work
to
be
done
in
connection
with
it
i
a
lot
of
new
specimens
just
arrived
awaiting
classification
and
tabulation
after
dinner
they
all
returned
to
the
forbes
seemed
desirous
of
keeping
up
a
general
conversation
but
it
was
hard
to
find
a
subject
to
interest
him
he
would
talk
a
few
moments
and
then
lapse
into
and
almost
forget
the
girls
presence
at
times
he
would
get
up
from
his
chair
and
stalk
up
and
down
the
room
perhaps
suddenly
pausing
in
front
of
one
of
them
and
asking
a
direct
question
how
old
are
you
he
asked
abruptly
of
alicia
sixteen
she
replied
i
was
sixteen
last
october
you
look
like
your
mother
at
that
age
she
was
my
only
sister
she
has
now
been
dead
ten
years
prompted
alicia
i
was
a
little
child
when
she
died
and
who
looks
after
you
now
your
father
sister
is
it
yes
uncle
jeff
my
aunt
nellie
but
i
at
school
you
know
i
shall
be
there
the
next
four
years
i
suppose
yes
yes
to
be
sure
yes
yes
of
course
and
you
bernice
you
have
no
mother
either
but
who
looks
after
you
i
look
after
myself
uncle
father
thinks
there
no
necessity
for
me
to
have
a
chaperon
in
our
little
home
town
not
a
chaperon
child
but
you
ought
to
have
some
one
to
guide
and
teach
you
dad
does
think
so
he
says
an
american
girl
can
take
care
of
herself
maybe
so
maybe
so
it
might
be
a
good
thing
for
you
to
go
to
school
with
alicia
it
might
be
but
i
like
our
high
school
at
home
and
we
learn
a
lot
there
but
not
the
same
kind
of
learning
do
they
teach
you
manners
and
general
society
instruction
no
said
bernice
smiling
at
thought
of
such
things
in
connection
with
the
berwick
school
but
my
father
thinks
those
things
come
naturally
to
girls
of
good
families
maybe
so
maybe
so
and
then
forbes
again
walked
up
and
down
the
long
room
seemingly
lost
in
his
own
thoughts
dolly
and
dotty
felt
a
little
uncomfortable
they
wanted
to
make
themselves
agreeable
and
entertaining
but
their
host
seemed
interested
exclusively
in
his
young
relatives
and
they
hesitated
lest
they
intrude
as
it
neared
ten
forbes
paused
in
his
pacing
of
the
room
bowed
to
each
of
the
four
in
turn
and
then
saying
courteously
i
bid
you
goodnight
he
vanished
into
the
hall
immediately
berry
entered
it
seemed
a
relief
to
see
her
kind
smiling
face
after
the
uncertain
phases
of
their
eccentric
host
now
you
young
people
must
go
to
bed
the
housekeeper
said
tired
or
ought
to
be
come
along
not
at
all
unwillingly
they
followed
her
upstairs
and
she
looked
after
their
comfort
in
most
solicitous
fashion
after
she
had
shown
them
how
to
ring
the
various
bells
to
call
the
maids
or
to
call
her
in
emergency
and
had
drawn
their
attention
to
the
ice
water
in
thermos
bottles
and
told
them
how
to
adjust
the
ventilators
she
bade
them
and
went
away
the
rooms
had
a
communicating
door
and
this
alicia
promptly
threw
open
and
came
through
into
the
two
d
room
oh
is
it
all
the
greatest
fun
and
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
crazy
as
uncle
jeff
what
he
wants
us
here
for
do
know
but
it
something
and
something
especial
he
never
asked
us
here
to
amuse
him
of
that
i
certain
not
much
he
did
and
bernice
followed
alicia
and
perched
on
the
edge
of
dolly
bed
is
he
queer
i
did
know
he
was
so
funny
as
he
is
did
you
alicia
no
i
have
seen
him
since
i
was
a
tiny
mite
but
he
all
right
he
knows
what
he
about
and
i
do
wonder
he
does
want
us
bothering
around
if
he
busy
i
love
to
see
his
collection
said
dolly
i
awfully
interested
in
such
things
oh
well
you
probably
have
a
chance
to
see
it
while
we
here
and
alicia
began
taking
down
her
hair
now
girls
let
get
to
bed
for
i
jolly
well
tired
out
but
i
foresee
these
poky
evenings
right
along
do
you
we
have
to
cram
a
lot
of
fun
into
our
days
if
the
evenings
are
to
be
spent
watching
an
elderly
gentleman
stalking
around
thus
and
then
alicia
gave
a
very
good
imitation
of
the
way
forbes
walked
around
she
did
ridicule
him
she
merely
burlesqued
his
manner
as
he
paused
to
speak
to
them
in
his
funny
abrupt
way
what
are
you
my
dear
she
said
looking
at
dolly
are
you
a
specimen
i
can
use
in
my
collection
no
are
you
a
fashionable
butterfly
i
say
bernice
she
suddenly
broke
off
why
was
he
so
curious
about
the
way
we
live
at
home
and
who
brings
us
up
i
do
know
and
anyway
he
knew
how
long
our
mothers
have
been
dead
and
who
takes
care
of
us
why
did
he
ask
those
things
over
and
over
i
think
he
a
bit
half
the
time
he
was
thinking
of
matters
far
removed
from
this
charming
quartette
of
bewitching
beauties
well
it
up
to
us
to
make
our
own
good
time
i
move
we
corral
the
big
limousine
for
morning
and
go
in
search
of
adventure
to
the
metropolitan
suggested
dolly
yes
if
you
like
though
i
rather
go
to
the
shops
and
alicia
gathered
up
her
hairpins
to
depart
her
long
light
hair
hung
round
her
shoulders
and
she
pushed
it
back
as
she
affectionately
kissed
dolly
and
dotty
you
are
sure
two
darlings
she
said
emphatically
chapter
v
going
about
four
smiling
eager
girls
trooped
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
and
found
berry
awaiting
them
she
presided
at
the
table
and
they
learned
that
she
would
always
do
so
at
breakfast
and
luncheon
though
she
did
not
dine
with
them
uncle
jeff
says

a
matinee
said
alicia
delightedly

you
see
about

him

bernice

suggested
dolly

all
the
places
of

places
of
interest

declared
alicia
i

dolly

bernice

as
much
right
to
your
way

alicia

and
dolly
smiled
brightly
this
is
the
house
of
alicia
uncle
and
not
mine

he
my
uncle
too
and
what
i
say

as
much
as

berry
in
her
amiable
way

all
be
suited

two
cars
you
know
and
if
you
each
want
to
go
in
a
different
direction
i
call
for

dolly
and
dotty
stared
at
this
new
lavishness
and
dotty
said
quickly
oh
no
do
do
that
we
all
want
to
be
together
wherever
we
go
and
i
think
as
dolly
does
that
bernice
and
alicia
must
choose
for
they
belong
here
and
we
guests
you
two
mighty
little
guests

berry
beamed
at

order

dolly

the
daytime
and
kirke

alicia
as

berry

comic

very
good

luncheon
promptly
at
one
so

get
ready
for
the
theatre
i
ca
believe
it
all
whispered
dotty
pinching
dolly
arm
as
they
ran
upstairs
to
prepare
for
their
morning
trip
think
of
our
going
to
all
these
places
in
one
day
and
six
days
more
to
come
added
dolly
oh
it
is
too
gorgeous
arrayed
in
warm
coats
and
furs
the
laughing
quartette
got
into
the
big
car
and
george
the
polite
footman
adjusted
the
robes
and
asked
their
destination
to
the
metropolitan
museum
first
said
alicia
unselfishly
oh
cried
dolly
with
sparkling
eyes
are
we
really
going
there
first
how
good
of
you
alicia
and
from
the
moment
they
entered
the
vestibule
of
the
great
museum
dolly
was
enthralled
with
what
she
saw
like
one
in
a
trance
she
walked
from
room
to
room
drinking
in
the
beauty
or
strangeness
of
the
exhibits
she
ignored
the
catalogues
merely
gazing
at
the
pictures
or
curios
with
an
absorbed
attention
that
made
her
oblivious
to
all
else
watch
her
said
alicia
nudging
dotty
she
does
even
know
where
she
is
just
now
she
back
in
assyria
with
the
people
that
wore
that
old
jewellery
sure
enough
dolly
was
staring
into
a
case
of
antique
bracelets
and
earrings
of
gold
and
jewels
she
moved
along
the
length
of
the
case
noting
each
piece
and
fairly
sighing
with
admiration
and
wonder
my
gracious
is
she
the
antiquarian
exclaimed
alicia
look
here
old
professor
wiseacre
what
dynasty
does
this
junk
belong
to
dolly
looked
up
with
a
vacant
stare
come
back
to
earth
cried
alicia
shaking
with
laughter
come
back
to
the
twentieth
century
we
mourn
our
loss
yes
come
back
dollums
said
dotty
there
are
other
rooms
full
of
stuff
awaiting
your
approval
dolly
laughed
oh
you
girls
do
appreciate
what
you
seeing
just
think
women
wore
these
very
things
real
live
women
well
they
not
alive
now
said
bernice
and
we
are
so
give
us
the
pleasure
of
your
company
say
dolly
some
day
you
come
up
here
all
alone
by
yourself
and
prowl
around
oh
i
love
to
i
do
just
that
and
then
i
wo
feel
that
delaying
you
girls
where
do
you
want
to
go
now
anywhere
out
of
this
old
museum
said
alicia
a
little
pettishly
you
had
your
way
dotty
now
it
only
fair
i
should
have
mine
we
about
an
hour
left
let
go
to
the
shops
yes
indeed
and
dolly
spoke
emphatically
i
did
realise
that
i
was
being
a
selfish
old
and
you
not
defended
bernice
we
all
wanted
to
come
here
but
well
you
see
dolly
you
do
dawdle
but
it
such
a
and
dolly
gazed
longingly
backward
as
they
left
the
antiquities
and
there
are
rooms
we
have
even
looked
into
yet
dozens
of
assented
alicia
but
not
this
morning
my
chickabiddy
i
must
flee
to
the
busy
marts
and
see
what
doing
in
the
way
of
tempting
bargains
all
right
and
dolly
put
her
arm
through
alicia
what
are
you
going
to
buy
dunno
till
i
see
something
that
strikes
my
fancy
but
in
the
paper
this
morning
i
noticed
a
special
sale
of
toggery
at
follansbee
let
go
there
never
heard
of
the
place
said
dolly
but
let
go
never
heard
of
follansbee
why
it
the
smartest
shop
in
new
york
for
sport
clothes
is
it
we
never
get
sport
clothes
unless
you
mean
middies
and
sweaters
my
mother
buys
those
at
the
department
stores
oh
you
ca
get
exclusive
models
there
and
alicia
face
wore
a
reproving
expression
no
said
outspoken
dolly
but
we
do
wear
exclusive
models
rather
inclusive
i
expect
you
a
duck
cried
alicia
who
though
herself
liked
the
honesty
and
frankness
of
the
two
d
they
reached
the
shop
in
question
and
the
four
girls
went
in
the
berwick
girls
were
a
little
awed
at
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
but
alicia
was
entirely
mistress
of
the
situation
she
had
many
costumes
and
accessories
shown
to
her
and
soon
became
as
deeply
absorbed
in
their
contemplation
as
dolly
had
been
in
the
museum
exhibits
why
for
goodness
sake
cried
bernice
at
last
are
you
going
to
buy
out
the
whole
shop
alicia
why
i
not
going
to
buy
any
returned
alicia
looking
surprised
i
just
shopping
you
know
oh
is
that
it
well
let
me
tell
you
it
is
any
particular
fun
for
us
to
look
on
while
you
and
anyway
it
time
to
be
going
home
or
we
be
late
for
the
luncheon
and
for
the
matinee
all
right
i
go
now
but
wait
i
want
to
buy
some
little
thing
for
you
girls
sort
of
a
souvenir
you
know
good
for
you
said
bernice
but
dolly
demurred
i
do
think
you
ought
to
alicia
she
said
i
do
believe
my
mother
would
like
me
to
take
it
nonsense
towhead
i
just
going
to
get
trifles
nobody
could
object
to
my
giving
you
a
tiny
token
of
my
regard
and
esteem
let
me
see
how
about
silk
sweaters
they
always
handy
to
have
in
the
house
unheeding
the
girls
protestations
alicia
selected
four
lovely
colours
and
asked
the
saleswoman
to
get
the
right
sizes
dolly
was
robin
egg
blue
dotty
salmon
pink
bernice
a
deep
orange
and
alicia
own
was
white
as
she
declared
she
already
had
every
colour
of
the
rainbow
then
she
selected
an
old
rose
one
for
berry
getting
permission
to
exchange
it
if
it
should
be
a
misfit
alicia
ordered
the
sweaters
sent
to
her
uncle
house
and
the
bill
sent
to
her
father
this
arrangement
seemed
perfectly
satisfactory
to
the
shop
people
and
the
girls
set
off
for
home
i
feel
uncomfortable
about
that
sweater
announced
dolly
as
they
were
on
their
way
that
does
matter
laughed
alicia
so
long
as
you
do
feel
uncomfortable
in
it
remove
that
anxious
scowl
my
little
towhead
i
love
to
give
things
to
my
friends
and
you
must
learn
to
accept
trifles
gracefully
but
it
is
a
trifle
alicia
i
know
mother
wo
like
it
wo
like
that
blue
sweater
why
it
a
beauty
i
do
mean
that
i
mean
she
wo
like
for
me
to
take
it
to
accept
it
from
you
all
right
tell
her
you
bought
it
yourself
tell
a
story
about
it
no
thank
you
dolly
blue
eyes
fairly
flashed
at
the
thought
well
my
stars
dolly
do
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
throw
it
away
or
give
it
to
the
scullery
maid
you
do
have
to
keep
it
clearly
alicia
was
annoyed
dolly
was
far
from
ungrateful
and
she
did
know
quite
what
to
do
of
course
she
keep
it
dotty
broke
in
anxious
to
straighten
matters
out
she
adores
it
alicia
but
we
girls
are
accustomed
to
making
each
other
gifts
at
least
not
expensive
ones
well
you
need
make
a
habit
of
it
one
sweater
does
make
a
summer
i
hope
berry
wo
be
so
squeamish
if
i
thought
she
would
i
throw
hers
in
the
ash
barrel
before
i
give
it
to
her
i
i
was
horrid
about
it
alicia
said
dolly
contritely
i
do
love
it
really
you
know
i
do
but
as
dotty
says
we
never
give
such
gifts
why
i
ca
give
you
anything
to
make
up
for
it
and
i
do
want
you
to
you
little
goose
but
like
as
not
you
can
sometime
do
something
for
me
worth
more
than
a
dozen
sweaters
i
hope
so
i
sure
will
you
tell
me
if
i
can
yes
i
declare
dolly
it
hard
to
realise
you
fifteen
years
old
you
act
about
twelve
and
look
ten
oh
not
so
bad
as
that
and
dolly
laughed
gaily
i
i
do
seem
younger
than
i
am
because
i
always
lived
in
a
small
town
we
do
things
like
city
girls
we
do
exclaimed
dotty
i
used
to
live
in
the
city
and
when
i
went
to
berwick
it
was
like
a
different
world
but
i
come
to
like
it
now
i
like
it
said
bernice
decidedly
i
think
we
have
a
lot
more
fun
in
berwick
than
we
could
in
new
york
to
live
i
mean
of
course
this
visit
here
is
lovely
but
it
the
novelty
and
the
strange
sights
that
make
it
so
i
would
want
to
live
in
new
york
neither
would
i
and
dolly
shook
her
head
very
positively
i
would
said
alicia
i
just
love
to
live
here
in
a
house
like
uncle
jeff
and
have
all
these
cars
and
servants
and
everything
fine
no
thank
you
dolly
rejoined
it
beautiful
for
a
week
but
it
makes
my
head
go
round
to
think
of
living
like
this
always
your
head
is
not
very
securely
fastened
on
anyway
and
alicia
grinned
at
her
you
lose
it
some
day
maybe
so
smiled
dolly
affably
and
then
they
suddenly
found
they
were
back
home
good
time
girlies
called
out
berry
as
they
entered
lunch
is
all
ready
sit
down
and
eat
it
and
get
dressed
for
the
matinee
afterward
fenn
got
fine
seats
for
you
near
the
front
like
the
play
i
know
and
like
the
play
they
did
it
was
a
light
opera
of
the
prettiest
type
full
of
lovely
scenery
gay
costumes
and
bright
catchy
music
the
lass
and
the
lascar
was
its
name
and
the
lass
in
question
was
a
charming
little
girl
who
seemed
no
older
than
the
quartette
themselves
the
lascar
was
a
tall
handsome
man
whose
swarthy
east
indian
effects
were
picturesque
and
attractive
he
had
a
magnificent
baritone
voice
and
the
girls
sat
breathless
when
he
sang
his
splendid
numbers
all
four
were
fond
of
music
and
even
more
than
the
gay
splendour
of
the
show
they
enjoyed
the
voices
and
orchestra
is
he
wonderful
exclaimed
alicia
as
the
curtain
fell
on
the
first
act
oh
girls
is
he
superb
i
madly
in
love
with
him
he
has
a
beautiful
voice
agreed
dolly
but
i
could
be
in
love
with
him
he
too
too
ferocious
but
that
his
charm
declared
alicia
rolling
her
eyes
in
ecstasy
oh
he
is
ideal
he
fascinating
the
curtain
rose
again
and
the
lascar
proved
even
more
fascinating
he
was
a
daredevil
type
as
lascars
have
the
reputation
of
being
but
he
was
gentle
and
affectionate
toward
the
lass
who
for
some
inexplicable
reason
scorned
his
advances
what
a
fool
she
is
what
a
fool
alicia
whispered
as
the
coquettish
heroine
laughed
at
the
impassioned
love
songs
of
her
suitor
i
should
fall
into
his
arms
at
once
then
there
would
be
any
more
opera
laughed
bernice
that
fall
into
his
arms
is
always
the
last
episode
on
the
stage
that
so
agreed
alicia
but
how
can
she
flout
him
so
oh
girls
is
he
the
grandest
man
i
never
saw
such
a
handsome
chap
what
a
lovely
name
he
has
too
bayne
coriell
a
beautiful
name
good
gracious
alicia
do
rave
over
him
like
that
somebody
will
hear
you
i
do
care
i
never
saw
any
one
so
wonderful
i
going
to
get
his
picture
when
we
go
out
i
suppose
it
for
sale
in
the
lobby
they
usually
are
are
they
asked
dolly
then
i
want
to
get
one
of
the
lass
marie
desmond
her
name
is
can
i
do
you
think
yes
of
course
dollykins
you
get
that
and
i
get
my
hero
my
idol
bayne
coriell
as
it
chanced
the
photographs
were
not
on
sale
at
the
theatre
but
an
usher
told
alicia
where
they
could
be
bought
and
she
directed
kirke
to
stop
there
on
the
way
home
she
bought
several
different
portraits
of
the
man
who
had
so
infatuated
her
and
dolly
bought
two
photographs
of
miss
desmond
the
other
girls
said
they
did
care
for
any
pictures
and
laughed
at
the
enthusiasm
of
alicia
and
dolly
i
want
this
dolly
defended
herself
because
sometime
i
going
to
be
an
opera
singer
i
did
mean
to
sing
in
grand
opera
and
maybe
i
will
but
if
i
ca
do
that
i
sing
in
light
opera
and
i
like
to
have
this
picture
to
remind
me
how
sweet
miss
desmond
looks
in
this
play
pooh
said
alicia
that
all
very
well
but
i
want
these
pictures
of
bayne
coriell
because
he
such
a
glorious
man
why
he
as
handsome
as
apollo
and
girls
i
do
believe
he
hardly
any
older
than
we
are
oh
he
must
be
returned
dotty
why
he
or
more
sure
maybe
he
is
twenty
but
not
more
than
that
oh
how
i
wish
i
could
meet
him
think
of
the
joy
of
talking
to
a
man
like
that
well
it
not
likely
you
ever
meet
bayne
coriell
said
bernice
laughing
at
the
idea
so
you
need
hope
for
that
chapter
vi
a
matinee
idol
oh
uncle
jeff
alicia
cried
as
they
gathered
round
the
that
same
night
we
went
to
the
splendidest
play
it
was
a
light
opera
lass
and
the
lascar
have
you
seen
it
no
my
dear
i
rarely
go
to
the
theatre
never
to
foolish
pieces
like
that
but
it
all
right
for
you
young
people
so
you
enjoyed
it
did
you
how
did
you
like
but
alicia
babble
interrupted
him
oh
uncle
it
was
simply
out
of
sight
and
the
hero
alicia
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
closed
her
eyes
as
if
the
memory
of
the
hero
was
overwhelming
took
your
fancy
did
he
asked
her
uncle
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
chap
faintly
expresses
it
and
alicia
returned
to
consciousness
he
was
like
a
greek
god
and
his
charm
oh
uncle
jeff
he
is
just
indescribable
i
wish
you
could
see
him
must
be
a
paragon
what
did
the
rest
of
you
girls
think
were
you
hit
so
hard
dotty
laughed
he
was
splendid
uncle
forbes
she
said
but
we
did
fall
so
head
over
heels
in
love
with
him
as
alicia
did
he
has
a
stunning
voice
and
he
a
fine
actor
oh
more
than
that
raved
alicia
he
a
darling
a
man
of
a
thousand
a
young
man
asked
forbes
yes
replied
bernice
alicia
thinks
he
is
twenty
but
he
ca
be
much
more
he
looked
a
mere
boy
was
that
because
he
was
made
up
as
a
young
character
in
the
play
partly
admitted
alicia
but
he
a
very
young
man
anyway
oh
uncle
jeff
i
just
crazy
over
him
i
think
i
shall
go
to
see
that
play
every
chance
i
can
possibly
get
could
we
go
to
an
evening
performance
speak
for
yourself
john
cried
bernice
i
do
want
to
see
that
play
again
i
enjoyed
it
heaps
and
i
think
coriell
was
fine
but
next
time
we
go
i
rather
see
something
else
so
would
i
said
the
two
d
together
how
can
you
say
so
and
alicia
looked
at
the
others
in
scorn
never
find
any
actor
who
can
hold
a
candle
to
coriell
i
have
his
picture
uncle
and
excusing
herself
she
left
the
table
to
get
them
h
yes
a
man
agreed
forbes
as
he
scrutinised
the
photographs
but
alicia
you
must
fall
in
love
with
every
operatic
tenor
you
see
i
believe
this
coriell
is
a
idol
but
do
allow
him
to
engage
your
young
affections
too
late
with
your
advice
uncle
jeff
and
alicia
gazed
raptly
at
the
pictures
i
adore
him
and
the
fact
that
my
adoration
is
hopeless
makes
it
all
the
more
interesting
oh
is
he
a
wonder
gaily
she
set
the
pictures
up
in
front
of
her
propping
them
on
glasses
or
salt
cellars
and
continued
to
make
mock
worship
at
his
shrine
do
be
silly
alicia
commented
her
uncle
but
she
only
shook
her
head
at
him
and
gave
a
mournful
sigh
the
girls
spent
the
evening
much
the
same
as
they
had
done
the
night
before
they
all
sat
in
the
stately
and
endeavoured
to
make
conversation
but
uncle
jeff
was
hard
to
talk
to
for
he
rarely
stuck
to
one
subject
for
more
than
five
minutes
at
a
time
and
abruptly
interrupted
the
girls
when
they
were
trying
their
best
to
be
entertaining
alicia
continued
to
chatter
about
her
enthusiasm
until
her
uncle
commanded
her
to
desist
may
i
beg
of
you
alicia
he
said
sternly
to
cease
raving
over
that
man
he
doubtless
old
enough
to
be
your
father
and
would
be
bored
to
death
could
he
hear
your
nonsense
about
him
alicia
looked
put
out
but
a
glance
at
her
uncle
face
proved
his
seriousness
and
she
said
no
more
about
the
actor
the
evening
wore
away
but
it
seemed
to
the
girls
as
if
it
never
would
be
ten
and
it
was
greatly
to
their
relief
when
at
about
nine
forbes
bade
them
and
went
off
upstairs
it
is
all
the
queerest
performance
said
bernice
what
in
the
world
does
uncle
jeff
want
of
us
i
ca
make
out
the
outlook
seems
to
be
that
we
can
have
all
the
fun
we
want
daytimes
and
pay
for
it
by
these
ghastly
evening
sessions
there
something
back
of
it
all
said
alicia
astutely
this
revered
uncle
of
ours
bernie
has
something
up
his
sleeve
i
think
so
too
said
dotty
he
scrutinises
us
all
so
closely
when
he
thinks
we
not
looking
but
i
for
one
am
quite
willing
to
put
up
with
these
evenings
for
the
sake
of
the
fun
we
have
in
the
daytime
i
should
say
so
agreed
dolly
we
never
can
thank
you
enough
bern
for
bringing
us
and
i
glad
to
have
you
here
said
berry
entering
the
room
you
like
a
ray
of
sunshine
in
this
dull
house
like
four
rays
of
sunshine
but
why
are
we
here
insisted
alicia
you
must
know
why
berry
do
tell
us
you
here
my
dears
because
forbes
invited
you
there
is
no
other
reason
no
other
explanation
and
now
tell
me
did
you
like
the
play
did
we
like
it
exclaimed
the
volatile
alicia
we
just
crazy
over
it
why
the
chief
actor
now
protested
dolly
if
you
going
to
begin
raving
over
that
man
again
well
i
am
declared
alicia
i
just
ca
help
it
nor
did
she
seem
able
to
curb
her
enthusiasm
for
after
the
girls
went
to
their
rooms
she
kept
on
extolling
coriell
until
the
others
were
tired
of
the
subject
and
even
when
the
d
were
nearly
ready
for
bed
and
in
kimonos
were
brushing
their
hair
alicia
burst
into
their
room
exclaiming
the
grandest
plan
i
going
to
invite
coriell
to
come
here
and
call
on
me
alicia
steele
dotty
cried
you
not
going
to
do
any
such
thing
yes
i
am
uncle
jeff
said
we
could
invite
anybody
we
wanted
to
that
permission
enough
for
me
but
he
did
mean
some
one
you
do
know
at
all
and
an
actor
at
that
i
do
care
he
did
make
any
exceptions
and
i
going
to
do
it
i
going
to
write
the
note
she
went
back
to
her
own
room
and
sat
down
at
the
pretty
little
escritoire
that
was
there
how
shall
i
address
him
she
asked
but
more
of
herself
than
the
others
not
at
all
said
dolly
and
she
took
the
pen
from
alicia
fingers
you
must
be
crazy
to
think
of
such
a
thing
do
do
it
alicia
begged
dotty
tell
her
not
to
bernice
i
do
care
what
she
does
and
bernice
laughed
it
none
of
my
affair
i
think
it
would
be
rather
good
fun
only
i
know
he
come
i
think
he
would
said
alicia
anyway
i
going
to
tell
him
how
i
adored
his
acting
and
his
singing
and
i
guess
he
be
glad
to
come
to
call
at
jefferson
forbes
house
i
think
i
ask
him
to
afternoon
tea
why
it
is
such
a
terrible
thing
as
you
seem
to
think
dolly
anybody
has
a
right
to
write
to
an
actor
they
expect
it
he
probably
gets
hundreds
of
notes
every
day
then
he
wo
notice
yours
he
ca
possibly
accept
a
hundred
invitations
oh
they
do
all
invite
him
any
way
i
going
to
write
alicia
found
another
pen
and
soon
produced
this
effusion
my
dear
coriell
i
just
simply
crazy
over
your
performance
in
lass
and
the
lascar
and
i
feel
that
i
must
meet
you
i
shall
die
if
i
do
please
oh
please
give
me
an
opportunity
will
you
come
to
see
me
at
my
uncle
house
jefferson
forbes
can
you
come
or
friday
i
ca
exist
if
you
say
no
so
grant
the
plea
of
your
devoted
admirer
alicia
steele
it
perfectly
horrid
and
dolly
fair
face
grew
flushed
with
anger
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
alicia
now
look
here
dolly
fayre
and
alicia
eyes
flashed
i
wo
be
dictated
to
by
a
little
country
ignoramus
i
had
experience
in
the
ways
of
the
world
and
you
have
now
suppose
you
let
me
alone
none
of
your
business
as
you
very
well
know
dolly
was
only
advising
you
for
your
own
good
dotty
flashed
out
indignant
at
the
rebuff
to
her
chum
but
truly
doll
it
is
up
to
you
to
tell
alicia
what
to
do
this
is
her
uncle
house
not
yours
and
you
in
no
way
responsible
for
her
doings
i
know
it
and
dolly
looked
serious
but
i
know
too
alicia
will
be
sorry
and
ashamed
if
she
sends
that
silly
letter
let
her
be
then
counselled
bernice
if
uncle
jeff
does
like
it
that
alicia
affair
not
ours
leave
her
alone
dolly
but
dolly
made
one
more
effort
listen
alicia
she
said
pleadingly
at
least
ask
advice
she
awfully
indulgent
you
know
and
if
she
says
all
right
then
go
ahead
alicia
looked
at
dolly
to
tell
the
truth
she
had
misgivings
herself
about
the
plan
but
she
was
too
proud
to
be
advised
i
tell
you
what
she
decided
at
last
you
said
only
dolly
that
you
be
glad
to
do
something
for
me
now
prove
that
you
meant
it
you
go
and
ask
berry
if
we
can
do
this
she
awfully
fond
of
you
and
she
say
yes
to
you
she
would
to
me
so
if
you
so
anxious
for
her
consent
go
and
ask
her
she
in
her
room
i
just
heard
her
go
in
but
alicia
and
dolly
looked
dismayed
do
want
to
do
this
thing
why
should
i
ask
berry
for
what
you
want
because
you
said
you
be
glad
to
do
me
a
favour
i
knew
you
mean
it
i
knew
you
fizzle
out
when
the
time
came
she
has
fizzled
out
exclaimed
dotty
doll
never
breaks
a
promise
but
say
alicia
i
go
and
ask
berry
how
that
no
dolly
got
to
go
if
any
one
does
she
said
she
love
to
do
me
a
favour
now
let
her
do
it
it
was
evidently
a
test
case
with
alicia
and
one
glance
at
her
determined
face
convinced
dolly
that
she
would
never
be
forgiven
if
she
failed
to
do
this
thing
all
right
she
said
slowly
i
go
and
ask
berry
but
i
shall
tell
her
it
for
you
alicia
i
sha
let
her
think
i
want
to
ask
that
man
here
hold
on
dolly
do
you
think
it
would
be
nice
if
he
should
come
with
berry
permission
yes
i
think
that
would
be
lots
of
fun
but
she
wo
give
permission
alicia
i
know
that
as
well
as
i
know
my
own
name
of
course
she
wo
if
you
go
about
it
that
way
i
depend
on
you
to
coax
her
or
get
around
her
some
way
to
make
her
say
yes
see
think
that
you
can
go
in
there
and
say
we
and
have
her
say
and
let
that
end
it
i
tell
you
you
got
to
get
her
consent
got
to
do
this
for
me
because
you
said
you
do
whatever
i
asked
you
oh
alicia
and
dotty
shook
her
head
vigorously
doll
never
said
that
well
she
meant
that
and
what
the
use
of
her
doing
anything
i
can
do
for
myself
but
you
all
know
she
berry
pet
of
the
four
of
us
no
i
not
and
dolly
looked
deeply
troubled
yes
you
are
and
it
just
because
you
so
mild
and
meek
now
will
you
go
and
ask
her
you
have
to
be
quick
or
she
have
gone
to
bed
yes
i
go
and
dolly
showed
sudden
determination
and
will
you
promise
to
do
all
you
can
to
make
her
say
yes
i
do
that
alicia
but
i
ca
promise
to
make
her
say
yes
you
can
if
you
coax
her
and
do
let
her
think
it
all
for
my
benefit
because
it
is
you
girls
will
have
just
as
much
fun
as
i
will
if
he
comes
dolly
twisted
up
her
golden
curls
in
a
loose
knot
and
still
in
her
trailing
she
went
down
the
hall
to
berry
room
and
tapped
gently
at
the
door
it
was
opened
at
once
and
dolly
was
glad
to
see
berry
had
not
yet
begun
her
preparations
for
the
night
so
she
was
not
disturbing
her
what
is
it
dearie
asked
the
lady
come
in
sit
down
dolly
sat
down
in
a
little
rocker
and
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
fit
of
shyness
the
request
she
had
come
to
make
seemed
so
impossible
that
she
could
put
it
into
words
berry
saw
her
embarrassment
and
kindly
strove
to
put
her
at
ease
how
do
you
like
my
room
she
said
cordially
you
never
been
in
here
before
it
lovely
said
dolly
looking
about
at
the
pretty
furnishings
it
in
a
sort
of
back
extension
is
it
yes
this
a
narrower
part
of
the
house
and
gives
me
an
outlook
on
our
tiny
yard
as
well
as
on
the
side
street
it
a
very
satisfactory
room
except
for
my
neighbour
and
she
laughed
who
is
the
unsatisfactory
neighbour
asked
dolly
smiling
in
response
not
the
people
next
door
they
quiet
enough
but
they
have
a
parrot
and
he
in
the
room
just
across
from
this
and
he
chatters
so
often
that
it
is
sometimes
very
annoying
look
over
you
can
see
him
now
sure
enough
as
dolly
looked
from
the
window
she
saw
a
big
polly
in
a
cage
at
the
opposite
casement
only
thin
lace
curtains
were
between
and
dolly
could
clearly
see
the
beautiful
bird
it
a
lovely
parrot
she
said
but
i
suppose
his
chatter
is
just
as
bothersome
as
if
he
were
a
homelier
bird
well
berry
and
she
turned
from
the
window
i
come
to
ask
you
something
and
something
that
you
hesitate
to
ask
i
can
see
that
but
do
be
afraid
dear
tell
me
what
it
is
and
if
i
have
to
refuse
you
at
least
i
wo
do
it
harshly
i
know
you
wo
and
dolly
felt
ashamed
of
her
fears
well
just
this
alicia
that
is
we
all
of
us
just
crazy
over
the
hero
in
the
play
we
saw
this
afternoon
and
we
that
is
we
think
it
would
be
nice
if
we
could
if
we
could
ask
him
to
to
call
here
on
us
the
dreaded
speech
was
made
and
though
berry
looked
surprised
she
did
exclaim
in
horror
at
the
idea
whose
plan
is
this
she
asked
quietly
why
well
we
all
want
it
yes
but
who
first
thought
of
it
alicia
spoke
of
it
and
the
others
agreed
we
all
agreed
that
it
would
be
lots
of
fun
if
you
approved
of
it
now
berry
could
see
a
hole
through
a
millstone
and
she
knew
as
well
as
if
she
had
been
told
that
the
others
had
planned
this
thing
probably
alicia
or
bernice
and
had
made
dolly
their
spokesman
because
of
her
acquiescence
what
do
you
think
of
the
idea
she
said
smiling
at
first
it
seemed
to
me
a
very
forward
thing
to
do
dolly
replied
looking
very
sober
but
if
you
think
it
all
right
i
like
to
meet
coriell
you
see
i
going
to
be
an
opera
singer
myself
some
day
and
there
are
a
few
questions
i
like
to
ask
him
berry
gasped
you
do
beat
the
dickens
she
exclaimed
so
going
on
the
stage
are
you
yes
i
think
so
then
of
course
you
ought
to
meet
an
actor
tell
alicia
to
go
ahead
and
ask
this
man
tell
her
to
invite
him
to
tea
on
friday
i
arrange
a
pretty
for
you
oh
i
tell
her
she
be
so
glad
and
dolly
departed
quite
unconscious
that
she
had
unwittingly
betrayed
alicia
principal
part
in
the
scheme
chapter
vii
great
preparations
demurely
dolly
went
back
to
her
room
the
other
girls
were
breathlessly
awaiting
her
return
and
pounced
on
her
for
the
news
at
least
you
got
back
alive
cried
dotty
as
she
grabbed
dolly
by
the
arms
and
danced
her
up
and
down
the
room
but
what
did
she
say
demanded
alicia
in
fiery
impatience
do
you
wish
you
knew
and
dolly
fell
into
a
teasing
mood
and
when
dolly
fayre
felt
like
teasing
she
was
adept
at
it
tell
us
tell
us
cried
bernice
oh
dolly
tell
us
tell
you
what
asked
dolly
with
an
innocent
stare
tell
us
what
berry
said
oh
she
asked
me
how
i
liked
her
room
and
she
showed
me
the
parrot
next
door
it
a
beautiful
bird
never
mind
a
bird
what
did
she
say
about
mr
coriell
why
we
talked
about
the
parrot
first
you
see
his
cage
hangs
in
a
window
right
across
from
hers
not
ten
feet
away
nonsense
cried
alicia
who
cares

like
fury

wonderful
singer

dolly
mischievously
enjoying

look
and
she
says

ask
him
to
tea
who

parrot

from
dotty
no
you
silly
coriell
but
of
course

the
parrot

be
sensible
and
bernice
looked
exasperated

going
to
tell
us

about
it
or
not

if

rude
to
me

two
dot
and
i
are
going
to
bed
not
much

declared
alicia
not
till

us
what
berry

then
you
must
ask
me
with
due
politeness
and
proper
courtesy
i
report
to
a
lot
of
cackling
geese
you
worse
than
parrots
please
dear
sweet
dollyrinda
what
did
the
lady
say
begged
dotty
in
wheedling
tones
ah
yes

us
and
alicia
took
the
cue
angel
child
beautiful
blonde
towhead
what
oh
vouchsafe
to
deign
to
tell
us
what
did
she
say
whoop
it
up
dollums
said
bernice
laughing
out
with
it
you
little
rascal
did
she
hold
up
her
hands
in
horror
she
did
not
said
dolly
with
dignity
she
said
that
if
alicia
chose
she
might
invite
the
gentleman
to
tea
on
friday
and
that
she
would
see
to
it
that
there
was
a
nice
prepared
for
his
benefit
there
who
a
good
ambassador
you
are
you
blessed
angel
cried
alicia
warmly
you
a
wonder
a
marvel
a
peach
a
pippin
oh
you
just
all
there
is
of
it
did
she
really
say
that
oh
you
want
to
know
what
she
really
said
and
dolly
head
went
on
one
side
as
she
began
to
tease
again
of
course
that
what
she
really
said
interposed
dotty
who
want
any
more
high
words
be
satisfied
with
that
and
scoot
to
bed
nothing
of
the
sort
we
going
to
make
fudge
to
celebrate
i
told
you
i
had
my
do
you
girls
feel
fudgy
i
could
nibble
a
morsel
bernice
said
and
not
half
try
how
about
you
dot
i
right
there
with
bells
on
is
it
too
late
objected
dolly
now
look
here
and
alicia
shook
a
finger
at
her
if
you
do
quit
that
spoilsporting
of
yours
there
be
trouble
in
camp
the
truth
is
there
not
much
fun
in
making
fudge
just
nobody
to
forbid
it
at
school
we
have
to
do
it
on
the
sly
here
if
berry
or
uncle
jeff
knew
we
thought
of
it
they
send
forty
footmen
and
maids
to
help
us
that
so
laughed
dolly
i
was
thinking
of
them
but
is
it
time
we
all
went
to
bed
of
course
it
is
young
hayseed
that
why
we
staying
up
also
it
makes
you
so
delightfully
sleepy
next
morning
now
do
you
come
to
this
fudge
party
or
do
you
go
to
bed
do
i
come
to
it
cried
dolly
in
disdain
well
i
like
that
why
your
old
fudge
party
is
for
me
i
the
heroine
of
the
hour
who
went
on
your
desperate
and
dangerous
errand
i
like
to
know
who
got
permission
to
invite
your
old
coriell
man
to
tea
come
now
declare
the
fudge
party
a
feast
in
my
honour
or
call
it
off
it
is
it
is
laughed
alicia
to
the
victor
belong
the
spoils
the
party
is
all
for
you
and
if
you
will
accept
our
humble
invitation
come
right
into
our
room
and
make
yourself
at
home
so
the
two
d
went
into
the
other
girls
room
and
alicia
got
out
her
set
and
prepared
for
the
feast
how
are
you
going
to
make
fudge
with
nothing
but
chocolate
laughed
dotty
that
so
said
alicia
looking
blank
i
forgot
i
had
to
have
milk
and
butter
and
sugar
and
a
lot
of
things
guess
we
ca
do
it
guess
we
can
retorted
bernice
and
she
pushed
a
bell
button
oh
bernie
exclaimed
dotty
you
ought
to
call
the
maid
so
late
she
be
in
bed
then
she
wo
answer
said
bernice
calmly
but
in
a
moment
a
maid
did
come
and
smilingly
listened
to
their
requests
some
milk
please
said
alicia
and
sugar
and
butter
all
the
things
for
fudge
miss
asked
the
girl
her
eyes
taking
in
the
certainly
in
a
moment
she
disappeared
and
the
girls
burst
into
peals
of
laughter
it
impossible
to
do
anything
frisky
here
said
alicia
because
everything
we
want
to
do
is
looked
on
as
all
right
well
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
make
fudge
of
an
evening
put
in
bernice
no
agreed
dolly
but
i
would
think
of
doing
it
at
my
house
after
i
gone
to
my
room
for
the
night
i
mean
it
a
funny
thing
said
alicia
but
all
the
fun
of
it
gone
now
i
do
care
two
cents
for
the
fudge
it
the
excitement
of
doing
it
secretly
that
appeals
to
me
we
do
it
at
school
and
we
have
to
be
so
fearfully
careful
lest
the
teachers
hear
us
i
know
what
you
mean
said
dolly
but
i
do
believe
i
feel
that
way
i
love
fudge
but
i
a
whole
lot
rather
have
people
know
making
it
than
to
do
it
on
the
sly
you
a
little
puritan
and
alicia
flew
over
and
kissed
her
no
wonder
berry
said
yes
to
you
you
probably
made
her
think
it
was
a
duty
to
humanity
when
the
maid
returned
with
the
trayful
of
things
they
had
asked
for
there
was
also
a
goodly
plate
of
frosted
cakes
and
a
dish
of
fruit
in
case
you
might
feel
hungry
she
explained
berry
was
saying
the
other
day
how
hungry
young
folks
do
be
gettin
shall
i
return
for
the
tray
miss
no
said
dolly
kindly
you
go
to
bed
we
set
the
things
out
in
the
hall
when
we
finished
and
you
can
take
them
away
in
the
morning
thank
you
miss
and
the
maid
went
away
leaving
the
girls
to
their
spread
i
not
going
to
make
fudge
said
alicia
there
enough
here
to
eat
without
it
i
do
it
then
said
dolly
i
not
going
to
make
all
this
trouble
and
then
not
seem
to
appreciate
it
she
began
to
cut
the
chocolate
and
dotty
helped
her
alicia
made
the
ready
and
bernice
set
out
a
table
for
them
this
is
splendid
fudge
alicia
remarked
as
at
last
they
sat
enjoying
the
feast
you
must
give
me
your
recipe
probably
just
like
yours
smiled
dolly
but
it
always
tastes
better
if
somebody
else
makes
it
not
always
it
depends
on
who
makes
it
this
is
fine
even
if
we
are
not
doing
it
on
the
sly
i
declare
alicia
i
understand
that
feeling
of
yours
i
you
do
care
so
much
about
coriell
since
berry
is
willing
it
does
take
the
snap
out
of
it
alicia
admitted
but
i
could
do
that
on
the
sly
anyway
i
mean
if
i
had
him
here
i
wish
i
could
meet
him
somewhere
else
at
some
tearoom
or
somewhere
oh
alicia
i
think
you
horrid
nice
girls
do
do
things
like
that
dolly
big
blue
eyes
expressed
such
amazement
that
alicia
laughed
outright
you
little
innocent
she
cried
i
rather
be
innocent
than
dolly
flashed
back
well
wait
till
you
go
to
and
you
get
some
of
those
notions
knocked
out
of
you
i
do
ever
expect
to
go
i
would
like
to
leave
home
and
that
reminds
me
girls
i
must
skip
i
got
to
write
up
my
diary
before
i
go
to
bed
you
do
my
share
of
the
clearing
up
wo
you
dot
i
will
and
dolly
ran
off
to
the
other
room
while
the
three
cleared
away
the
party
and
set
the
tray
out
in
the
hall
is
dolly
always
so
asked
alicia
dotty
took
the
question
seriously
i
should
call
her
that
she
said
but
she
is
very
mischievous
and
she
as
honest
as
the
day
is
long
she
positively
abhors
deceit
and
somehow
alicia
all
the
things
that
you
think
are
fun
are
the
sort
of
things
she
does
stand
for
that
all
doll
is
a
prig
is
she
bernice
no
she
as
fond
of
fun
as
anybody
but
alicia
rubs
her
the
wrong
way
i
do
mean
to
only
i
do
see
any
harm
in
pranks
that
she
thinks
are
fearful
well
you
ought
to
bless
her
for
getting
the
coriell
matter
fixed
up
i
do
believe
berry
would
have
done
it
for
any
of
us
but
when
dolly
asked
her
i
she
made
it
seem
all
right
it
is
all
right
defended
alicia
oh
i
do
know
and
bernice
looked
doubtful
i
do
think
the
fayres
or
roses
would
like
it
much
i
doubt
if
my
dad
would
approve
but
what
berry
says
goes
it
does
so
assented
alicia
and
then
they
all
said
alicia
letter
was
mailed
next
morning
and
to
her
surprise
a
reply
arrived
about
noon
brought
by
a
messenger
it
said
my
dear
miss
steele
your
welcome
invitation
is
here
i
can
not
accept
for
as
i
have
an
important
engagement
then
but
i
will
do
myself
the
pleasure
of
calling
upon
you
at
four
and
trust
i
may
find
you
at
home
sincerely
yours
bayne
coriell
oh
is
it
wonderful
sighed
alicia
a
letter
from
him
oh
girls
i
so
happy
how
can
i
wait
for
four
she
ran
away
to
tell
berry
of
the
letter
very
well
said
the
woman
it
just
as
well
to
have
him
come
suppose
we
have
tea
in
the
small
reception
room
cosier
than
the
all
right
said
alicia
will
uncle
jeff
come
down
do
you
think
i
doubt
it
however
i
tell
him
you
expect
coriell
and
he
can
do
as
he
likes
berry
had
a
peculiar
twinkle
in
her
eye
and
alicia
noted
it
and
wondered
what
it
meant
the
whole
affair
seemed
mysterious
for
she
had
not
supposed
berry
would
be
so
ready
to
receive
this
strange
young
man
you
think
it
all
right
for
us
to
receive
him
do
you
mrs
berry
she
asked
for
she
began
to
fear
lest
she
had
been
too
unconventional
i
daresay
it
all
right
my
dear
of
course
such
things
were
done
in
my
day
but
young
folks
are
different
now
and
forbes
said
you
girls
were
to
do
pretty
much
as
you
like
were
you
surprised
at
our
asking
for
this
alicia
persisted
well
yes
since
you
ask
me
i
must
say
i
was
surprised
especially
when
i
found
dolly
fayre
was
the
ringleader
oh
well
she
did
ask
you
did
she
maybe
dolly
is
such
a
quiet
little
mouse
as
she
seems
dolly
all
right
and
berry
spoke
with
some
asperity
now
i
send
tea
in
at
quarter
past
four
is
that
your
idea
oh
berry
wo
you
be
present
no
i
have
my
duties
and
i
observe
them
properly
but
to
preside
at
tea
is
not
one
of
them
your
uncle
expressly
ordered
that
do
you
mean
uncle
jeff
ordered
that
we
should
receive
coriell
alone
well
he
did
direct
that
should
be
there
if
he
wants
to
come
down
he
will
very
well
and
alicia
suddenly
became
dignified
we
can
manage
i
suppose
it
will
be
proper
to
dress
up
a
good
deal
again
that
amused
smile
flitted
over
berry
face
as
you
like
she
said
indifferently
all
your
frocks
are
pretty
alicia
returned
to
the
others
and
told
them
all
the
conversation
i
hope
uncle
forbes
does
come
down
said
dolly
i
think
it
would
be
nicer
to
have
him
there
come
now
old
mother
prim
do
throw
cold
water
on
our
little
party
said
alicia
you
know
how
the
conversation
would
run
with
uncle
at
the
helm
it
would
run
at
all
laughed
bernice
it
would
stagnate
when
the
girls
began
to
dress
for
the
tea
there
was
a
wide
diversity
of
opinion
as
to
appropriate
costumes
our
very
best
said
alicia
decidedly
nothing
too
good
for
bayne
you
better
be
careful
warned
dotty
you
call
him
bayne
to
his
face
you
use
it
so
much
do
care
if
i
do
returned
alicia
pertly
i
say
doll
is
that
your
best
frock
yes
except
an
evening
one
let
see
your
evening
one
i
bet
it
just
about
right
for
this
afternoon
dolly
produced
a
pretty
light
blue
affair
of
chiffon
and
alicia
exclaimed
wear
that
of
course
it
really
no
evening
dress
at
all
but
it
a
very
nice
afternoon
thing
dolly
looked
dubious
what
are
you
going
to
wear
dots
she
said
oh
i
we
might
as
well
wear
our
best
ones
as
alicia
says
they
all
right
for
afternoon
here
though
they
would
be
in
berwick
all
right
and
dolly
put
on
her
pretty
fluffy
dress
very
lovely
she
looked
her
golden
curls
twisted
up
high
on
her
head
and
held
by
a
bandeau
of
blue
ribbon
dotty
dress
was
yellow
and
very
becoming
she
wore
a
black
velvet
headband
and
alicia
cried
out
in
approval
when
she
saw
the
two
ready
for
inspection
my
she
said
you
look
better
than
i
do
now
i
am
mad
but
her
rage
was
only
simulated
and
she
did
really
think
what
she
said
she
herself
wore
a
most
elaborate
embroidered
dress
of
rich
pink
silk
it
was
trimmed
too
with
pearl
bead
fringe
and
to
dolly
simple
taste
it
was
too
fussy
but
dotty
admired
it
and
bernice
thought
it
wonderful
it
is
a
good
thing
said
alicia
carelessly
it
imported
never
had
it
on
before
bernice
had
a
lovely
dress
of
white
tulle
with
white
satin
ribbons
lovely
that
is
for
evening
but
too
dressy
for
daytime
however
as
the
winter
dusk
fell
early
the
lights
were
on
and
it
seemed
almost
like
evening
chapter
viii
the
caller
the
four
girls
in
the
reception
room
waited
the
coming
of
their
guest
to
their
surprise
forbes
came
in
and
looked
them
over
with
a
chuckle
well
you
are
ready
for
the
fray
are
you
he
said
taking
in
their
dressy
finery
and
their
important
airs
yes
uncle
jeff
responded
alicia
will
you
stay
and
see
our
young
man
for
some
unexplained
reason
uncle
jeff
laughed
heartily
but
he
checked
his
merriment
and
said
no
alicia
i
fear
i
might
intrude
i
know
you
want
to
flirt
with
this
young
actor
and
i
be
a
spoilsport
but
let
me
warn
you
to
be
very
gentle
with
him
you
see
he
may
be
so
overcome
by
this
galaxy
of
youth
and
beauty
that
he
be
embarrassed
and
run
away
nonsense
uncle
said
bernice
actors
are
not
easily
embarrassed
more
likely
we
girls
will
be
struck
dumb
at
his
splendour
and
importance
well
tell
me
all
about
it
afterward
and
still
chuckling
forbes
went
off
what
ails
uncle
said
alicia
pettishly
anybody
think
he
had
a
joke
on
us
no
dotty
rejoined
only
he
sort
of
old
you
know
and
he
see
the
fun
in
this
as
we
do
well
i
wish
the
fun
would
hurry
up
it
after
four
now
such
people
are
never
on
time
said
alicia
with
a
great
air
of
experience
he
sure
to
be
late
oh
there
the
bell
now
the
girls
with
hearts
beating
high
grouped
themselves
in
a
picturesque
pose
which
they
had
practised
beforehand
and
breathlessly
watched
the
doorway
through
it
came
in
a
moment
a
man
with
an
informal
manner
and
pleasant
smile
hullo
girlies
he
said
what
up
expecting
a
party
well
i
keep
you
a
minute
where
mr
forbes
why
you
the
party
coriell
said
alicia
stepping
forward
to
greet
him
and
looking
very
coquettish
as
she
smiled
up
into
his
face
oh
am
i
all
right
have
it
your
own
way
kiddies
but
i
ca
give
you
more
than
ten
minutes
of
my
valuable
time
what
do
you
want
autographs
or
tickets
for
a
box
speak
up
now
oh
no
exclaimed
bernice
for
alicia
was
speechless
with
disappointment
at
this
prosaic
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
visitor
we
just
want
to
to
talk
to
you
you
see
said
dolly
frankly
we
thought
you
be
different
oh
of
course
you
did
they
always
do
you
wanted
to
see
the
lascar
not
plain
james
brown
what
cried
alicia
hope
rising
in
her
breast
that
this
was
not
the
great
actor
after
all
are
you
bayne
coriell
sure
that
my
stage
name
but
in
private
life
i
james
brown
at
your
service
you
do
even
look
like
the
lascar
wailed
dotty
dismayed
at
the
turn
things
had
taken
of
course
i
do
little
one
actors
on
and
off
are
two
different
persons
oh
i
begin
to
see
through
this
performance
your
uncle
tell
you
anything
about
me
eh
no
sir
said
dolly
as
the
others
were
silent
we
saw
you
in
your
play
and
we
admired
your
work
so
much
that
we
we
oh
the
matinee
idol
business
well
well
i
did
expect
that
why
kiddies
outside
the
theatre
i
just
a
plain
united
states
citizen
i
have
a
daughter
about
the
age
of
you
girls
my
muriel
is
fourteen
nearly
fifteen
but
she
taller
than
any
of
you
your
uncle
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
he
was
my
father
chum
and
he
has
been
more
than
kind
to
me
all
my
life
i
supposed
he
knew
all
about
the
letter
from
miss
alicia
and
ran
around
here
expecting
to
see
you
and
him
both
that
why
he
chuckled
at
us
and
dolly
eyes
twinkled
at
the
joke
somehow
she
seemed
more
at
ease
with
the
actor
than
the
other
girls
you
see
brown
we
thought
you
be
more
like
you
are
on
the
stage
of
course
we
did
expect
you
be
dressed
like
the
lascar
or
or
made
up
is
that
what
you
call
it
but
we
thought
you
be
stagy
and
actory
james
brown
laughed
everybody
thinks
that
or
something
like
it
he
said
few
people
realise
that
an
actor
profession
is
merely
a
profession
a
business
and
that
we
discard
it
out
of
business
hours
but
do
you
get
lots
of
notes
from
from
your
audiences
asked
dotty
indeed
i
do
my
wife
looks
after
and
most
of
go
into
the
trash
basket
but
of
course
a
note
from
jefferson
forbes
home
was
welcome
and
i
was
glad
to
call
on
his
nieces
are
you
all
his
nieces
no
said
alicia
who
had
recovered
her
poise
and
she
introduced
the
other
girls
by
name
i
wrote
the
note
because
i
thought
you
were
because
you
thought
i
was
a
gay
young
sport
laughed
james
brown
well
i
sorry
for
your
sake
that
i
merely
an
uninteresting
man
but
i
doubt
if
your
uncle
would
have
let
you
send
that
note
if
i
had
been
a
stranger
to
him
take
my
advice
girls
for
i
know
what
i
talking
about
never
write
to
an
actor
with
whom
you
are
not
acquainted
it
can
never
lead
to
any
good
result
and
might
lead
to
great
harm
are
they
all
bad
asked
dolly
innocently
no
indeed
far
from
it
but
many
of
them
are
thoughtless
and
too
if
a
girl
so
far
forgets
the
conventions
as
to
write
to
a
stranger
an
actor
often
thinks
he
is
justified
in
meeting
her
half
way
and
nice
girls
do
write
to
men
they
do
know
the
fact
that
a
man
is
an
actor
is
no
more
reason
to
treat
him
informally
than
if
he
were
a
broker
or
a
merchant
it
is
the
glamour
of
the
stage
that
blinds
you
to
the
proprieties
that
only
natural
i
know
and
that
why
presuming
to
give
you
this
little
talk
for
your
own
good
if
ever
you
feel
moved
to
make
advances
to
a
matinee
idol
do
do
it
alicia
looked
decidedly
chagrined
and
a
little
angry
but
brown
proceeded
to
talk
of
other
matters
and
though
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
he
meant
the
advice
he
had
given
them
all
unpleasant
effect
was
forgotten
as
he
began
to
tell
them
some
funny
anecdotes
and
then
tea
was
brought
in
and
they
all
grouped
round
the
teatable
still
listening
to
his
entertaining
chat
the
actor
was
a
man
but
far
from
being
as
handsome
as
he
appeared
on
the
stage
his
fascination
and
charm
were
evidently
as
much
put
on
as
his
swarthy
complexion
and
long
black
hair
which
so
became
him
as
an
east
indian
really
his
hair
was
and
he
was
rather
bald
i
expect
to
go
on
the
stage
observed
dolly
as
they
ate
the
cakes
and
that
accompanied
the
elaborate
tea
service
you
do
exclaimed
the
guest
why
because
i
feel
i
have
talent
for
it
not
so
much
as
an
actress
perhaps
but
as
a
singer
what
shall
i
do
first
brown
to
prepare
for
the
light
opera
stage
james
brown
looked
at
her
kindly
i
see
you
are
in
earnest
he
said
in
a
serious
tone
and
so
i
will
treat
your
question
practically
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
finish
your
education
and
then
start
on
a
course
of
voice
training
by
the
time
you
have
done
these
things
come
to
me
again
and
i
will
advise
you
further
do
you
think
me
flippant
he
continued
as
dolly
looked
decidedly
disappointed
i
am
telling
you
just
the
line
to
follow
that
i
expect
my
own
daughter
to
pursue
muriel
has
promise
of
a
good
singing
voice
i
assume
you
have
that
hope
also
otherwise
you
would
think
of
a
stage
career
tell
your
parents
what
i
have
told
you
and
if
they
care
to
consult
me
on
the
subject
i
shall
be
more
than
glad
to
meet
them
good
gracious
what
a
come
down
cried
dotty
we
thought
of
course
doll
could
start
in
in
the
chorus
at
most
any
time
and
work
up
that
has
been
done
successfully
and
brown
smiled
about
one
time
in
ten
thousand
my
plan
is
surer
and
better
in
every
way
is
that
the
way
miss
marie
desmond
learned
asked
dolly
wistfully
yes
my
child
miss
desmond
worked
long
and
faithfully
before
she
attained
her
present
position
if
you
care
to
meet
her
and
have
a
little
talk
with
her
i
can
arrange
it
suppose
you
all
come
to
my
house
some
afternoon
and
muriel
will
make
a
little
party
for
you
and
i
sure
i
can
persuade
miss
desmond
to
meet
you
for
a
few
minutes
at
least
she
is
not
a
lady
easy
of
access
i
can
tell
you
but
she
will
meet
friends
of
mine
well
well
jim
hobnobbing
with
young
people
are
you
sang
out
a
hearty
voice
from
the
hall
and
uncle
jeff
came
stalking
into
the
room
glad
to
see
you
my
boy
you
seem
to
be
getting
on
famously
yes
indeed
your
nieces
and
their
friends
are
the
most
charming
bunch
of
young
people
i
seen
in
a
long
time
we
discussing
all
sorts
of
matters
of
interest
join
us
in
a
cup
of
tea
wo
you
that
what
i
here
for
and
uncle
jeff
took
a
seat
among
the
group
yes
thank
you
alicia
fix
me
up
a
cup
sugar
please
but
no
lemon
how
your
wife
jim
muriel
all
right
yes
thank
you
i
just
asking
these
girls
to
come
round
say
for
a
little
party
or
would
you
rather
have
a
box
party
at
the
theatre
the
girls
decided
in
favour
of
the
afternoon
party
at
brown
home
and
the
matter
was
settled
and
then
somehow
the
two
men
fell
into
conversation
which
in
no
way
interested
the
girls
being
about
political
matters
and
business
affairs
indeed
their
very
presence
seemed
to
be
forgotten
by
the
gentlemen
uncle
jeff
accepted
a
second
cup
of
tea
and
then
a
third
still
arguing
a
point
of
finance
with
his
guest
alicia
in
high
dudgeon
made
a
motion
to
the
others
that
they
leave
the
room
and
dolly
nodded
assent
so
noiselessly
the
four
rose
from
their
seats
and
stole
out
into
the
hall
brown
looked
up
saw
them
go
and
waved
his
hand
with
a
smile
of
farewell
but
uncle
jeff
paid
no
attention
if
indeed
he
noticed
their
departure
well
of
all
things
exclaimed
alicia
as
they
sought
refuge
in
the
library
which
was
in
the
rear
of
the
house
i
call
that
positively
insulting
now
and
dotty
laughed
you
know
the
man
said
he
could
only
give
us
ten
minutes
of
his
time
and
he
gave
us
more
than
a
half
hour
i
do
think
we
any
reason
to
complain
well
i
do
it
was
a
perfect
fizzle
the
whole
thing
i
utterly
disgusted
matinee
idol
pooh
he
just
an
man
well
that
just
what
he
said
he
was
rejoined
bernice
who
was
almost
as
much
disappointed
as
alicia
but
he
was
very
kind
and
pleasant
i
think
oh
kind
enough
and
alicia
still
pouted
but
i
thought
he
would
be
young
and
and
sporty
you
know
he
certainly
is
sporty
whatever
he
is
said
dolly
i
think
awfully
nice
i
glad
we
going
to
his
daughter
party
it
fine
to
go
to
a
place
like
that
she
just
a
little
girl
complained
alicia
fourteen
years
old
i
do
want
to
go
to
an
infant
class
all
right
put
in
bernice
you
can
stay
home
then
i
delighted
to
go
to
think
of
telling
the
girls
at
home
that
we
went
to
bayne
coriell
daughter
party
my
wo
they
think
we
grand
that
so
agreed
alicia
not
everybody
could
get
such
an
invitation
we
could
only
that
he
uncle
jeff
friend
but
i
can
tell
you
girls
if
i
had
got
up
this
whole
scheme
we
would
have
been
asked
there
you
can
thank
me
for
it
dolly
too
said
dotty
if
she
had
asked
berry
he
have
come
at
all
yes
he
would
why
would
he
oh
pshaw
it
was
all
made
up
by
uncle
jeff
you
could
see
that
berry
told
him
and
he
let
us
go
ahead
just
to
have
a
joke
on
us
brown
came
mostly
to
see
forbes
not
us
you
right
you
little
and
alicia
smiled
at
the
astute
dotty
and
i
do
believe
uncle
jeff
meant
to
give
us
a
lesson
about
writing
to
actors
i
thought
it
was
queer
he
took
it
so
easily
and
berry
too
they
played
right
into
our
hands
they
would
have
done
that
if
the
actor
person
had
been
a
stranger
of
course
they
would
and
dotty
wagged
her
head
i
felt
sure
there
was
some
reason
why
berry
said
yes
to
doll
so
easily
but
i
did
think
coriell
bayne
or
whatever
his
name
is
was
old
enough
to
be
uncle
forbes
chum
he
is
exactly
said
dolly
that
is
he
said
his
father
and
forbes
were
friends
i
suppose
the
son
carried
on
the
friendship
he
looks
as
old
as
my
father
off
the
stage
said
bernice
but
on
it
he
might
be
my
father
son
you
ca
tell
a
thing
about
actors
declared
alicia
if
ever
i
think
another
one
is
handsome
and
fascinating
i
remember
james
bayne
and
know
he
nothing
but
an
old
fogy
oh
i
do
call
brown
an
old
fogy
defended
dotty
i
think
interesting
and
pleasant
just
about
like
my
father
or
yours
doll
he
not
a
bit
like
our
fathers
though
he
does
look
much
younger
anyway
i
glad
i
met
him
but
he
did
give
me
a
setback
about
my
career
is
that
a
real
stunt
dolly
and
alicia
looked
at
her
curiously
do
you
really
want
to
go
on
the
stage
it
does
seem
like
you
yes
i
do
or
at
least
i
did
until
brown
said
what
he
did
i
do
know
as
i
want
to
devote
my
whole
life
to
getting
ready
for
a
stage
career
i
going
to
think
it
over
and
see
about
it
you
funny
little
thing
i
hope
you
decide
to
do
it
and
in
about
ten
or
twenty
years
when
i
an
old
married
woman
i
come
to
your
first
performance
whose
performance
who
stage
struck
asked
uncle
jeff
walking
in
at
the
door
he
had
a
way
of
appearing
unexpectedly
dolly
answered
alicia
she
wants
to
be
a
prima
donna
bless
my
soul
exclaimed
the
old
man
why
one
reason
i
had
jim
brown
here
was
to
knock
such
foolishness
out
of
your
heads
and
he
did
his
part
all
right
uncle
forbes
said
dolly
looking
serious
but
i
do
quite
take
the
knocking
at
least
i
decided
what
i
do
about
it
oho
you
have
have
you
and
the
old
man
raised
his
shaggy
eyebrows
well
alicia
how
did
you
like
your
handsome
fascinating
young
man
alicia
had
quite
recovered
her
good
humour
and
she
replied
laughingly
oh
except
that
he
is
very
young
or
handsome
or
fascinating
i
liked
him
pretty
well
you
a
good
girl
pronounced
her
uncle
i
thought
maybe
resent
the
little
trick
i
played
on
you
but
when
you
raved
over
the
handsome
hero
and
the
greek
god
effects
of
him
i
could
refrain
from
showing
you
how
deceitful
appearances
may
be
jim
a
fine
chap
not
at
all
a
silly
flirt
and
his
daughter
is
a
lovely
young
girl
a
little
older
than
you
girls
why
uncle
jeff
brown
says
she
younger
he
said
muriel
is
not
yet
fifteen
bless
me
is
that
so
well
he
must
know
but
i
can
tell
you
she
seems
as
old
or
older
than
any
of
you
i
suppose
because
she
been
brought
up
among
stage
people
but
a
mighty
nice
girl
all
the
same
and
brown
is
a
delightful
woman
all
nice
people
i
glad
he
asked
you
to
his
home
it
be
a
rare
treat
for
you
when
is
it
to
be
asked
dotty
we
do
know
yet
when
brown
went
away
he
said
he
consult
his
wife
and
daughter
and
telephone
us
about
it
i
fancy
they
make
quite
an
affair
of
it
see
here
have
you
all
proper
frocks
to
wear
i
want
my
girls
less
well
dressed
than
the
others
there
and
i
have
a
sneaking
notion
these
are
your
best
clothes
uncle
jeff
eyes
twinkled
as
he
glanced
at
their
dresses
anyway
i
like
to
give
each
of
you
a
new
frock
go
morning
and
get
them
and
having
given
the
order
uncle
jeff
stalked
away
chapter
ix
fine
feathers
is
he
the
funniest
and
the
very
dearest
old
thing
in
the
world
said
alicia
in
a
whisper
as
forbes
disappeared
i
got
loads
of
clothes
but
i
glad
to
have
him
give
me
a
dress
for
i
warrant
it
be
about
the
best
money
can
buy
let
get
the
best
new
york
can
show
us
chimed
in
bernice
i
ca
do
it
said
dolly
decidedly
my
mother
would
like
me
to
accept
a
dress
from
mr
forbes
oh
fiddlesticks
dollyrinda
said
dotty
it
not
charity
my
mother
would
let
me
either
ordinarily
speaking
but
this
is
different
how
is
it
different
why
forbes
does
look
on
it
as
giving
as
clothes
because
poor
he
does
so
dot
you
ca
fool
me
he
knows
that
alicia
and
bernie
can
afford
grand
clothes
and
we
ca
and
so
he
gives
us
each
a
dress
to
make
it
easy
for
us
to
take
them
now
alicia
privately
thought
this
was
just
about
the
truth
but
bernice
thought
differently
rubbish
she
cried
uncle
jeff
think
anything
of
the
sort
he
so
he
wants
us
all
to
have
things
nice
and
he
does
even
think
about
whether
it
would
hurt
our
feelings
or
not
why
dolly
the
price
of
a
dress
is
no
more
to
him
than
a
glass
of
soda
water
would
be
to
us
i
know
that
so
and
dolly
blue
eyes
looked
very
troubled
but
it
is
nice
to
take
clothing
from
anybody
but
your
own
people
but
dolly
argued
alicia
if
you
kick
up
a
bobbery
and
refuse
to
take
this
kind
offer
then
we
all
have
to
do
the
same
and
you
deprive
us
all
of
the
pretty
presents
oh
alicia
i
be
sorry
to
do
that
well
that
what
it
would
amount
to
now
be
sensible
and
go
with
us
and
we
all
get
lovely
dresses
and
it
will
please
uncle
jeff
i
know
he
be
hurt
and
offended
if
you
refused
dolly
i
see
about
it
i
think
it
over
and
that
was
all
dolly
would
say
about
it
then
but
next
morning
berry
informed
them
that
they
were
asked
to
an
at
home
at
brown
that
afternoon
from
four
till
seven
and
she
further
said
that
of
her
knowledge
it
would
be
an
occasion
where
the
nicest
possible
apparel
would
be
required
gorgeous
cried
alicia
uncle
jeff
told
us
yesterday
we
could
get
new
frocks
as
presents
from
him
we
can
get
them
at
follansbee
and
if
they
need
alteration
they
do
it
for
us
at
once
as
the
case
is
so
especial
dolly
objections
were
overruled
even
berry
siding
with
the
other
girls
yes
indeed
dolly
she
said
you
will
spoil
the
pleasure
of
the
others
if
you
refuse
to
do
as
they
do
and
it
would
grieve
forbes
if
he
thought
you
did
appreciate
or
accept
his
kind
offer
run
along
girls
all
of
you
and
get
your
hats
and
coats
the
car
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
wo
you
go
with
us
berry
asked
dolly
to
help
pick
them
out
we
do
know
about
these
things
as
well
as
some
one
who
lives
in
the
city
no
dearies
but
you
wo
have
any
trouble
just
ask
for
baxter
at
follansbee
and
her
judgment
will
be
the
right
thing
be
sure
to
take
what
she
advises
she
know
in
gay
spirits
the
quartette
started
off
dolly
joining
in
the
general
enthusiasm
for
having
decided
to
do
as
the
others
did
she
had
no
wish
to
hesitate
further
baxter
was
more
than
pleased
to
advise
and
suggest
to
jefferson
forbes
relatives
and
she
had
her
assistants
bring
out
dozens
of
frocks
for
inspection
at
last
after
much
discussion
and
trying
on
the
four
were
selected
and
were
promised
for
two
that
afternoon
what
slight
alterations
were
necessary
could
be
done
in
that
time
and
there
would
be
no
doubt
of
prompt
delivery
the
dresses
were
absolutely
unlike
any
the
girls
had
ever
owned
before
they
were
all
imported
models
and
though
of
finest
materials
were
simple
in
fabric
and
design
yet
they
had
an
air
and
an
effect
never
achieved
by
a
village
dressmaker
or
a
department
store
dolly
was
of
fine
white
net
frilled
with
delicate
lace
and
adorned
with
tiny
rosebud
garlands
and
knots
of
pale
blue
velvet
dotty
of
apricot
pink
crepe
with
hints
of
silver
lace
peeping
through
its
chiffon
draperies
alicia
was
crepe
de
chine
with
cherry
velvet
decorations
and
bernice
rejoiced
in
a
white
embroidered
net
made
up
over
green
silk
all
had
that
indefinable
charm
which
betokens
the
genius
of
a
great
modiste
and
the
girls
were
enchanted
with
the
wonderful
robes
but
what
awful
prices
said
dolly
as
they
drove
away
from
the
shop
i
sure
mother
will
be
displeased
i
feel
awfully
about
it
now
doll
said
dotty
sensibly
you
ca
help
it
now
so
do
let
it
spoil
your
pleasure
and
ours
too
when
we
get
home
you
can
tell
your
mother
just
how
it
was
i
tell
her
too
and
i
sure
she
see
that
you
could
do
anything
else
than
get
the
frock
or
kick
up
a
terrible
bobbery
this
was
common
sense
as
dotty
remarks
often
were
so
dolly
accepted
the
situation
and
made
the
best
of
it
and
that
afternoon
when
they
were
all
arrayed
in
the
new
frocks
and
presented
themselves
to
uncle
jeff
for
inspection
his
approval
was
so
hearty
that
dolly
was
very
glad
she
had
put
a
damper
on
the
whole
thing
by
remaining
obstinate
you
are
visions
of
beauty
he
declared
as
he
looked
at
each
in
turn
madame
turned
you
out
remarkably
well
i
do
know
much
about
feminine
millinery
but
i
a
general
idea
of
the
fitness
of
things
and
i
bet
a
thousand
dollars
that
these
affairs
are
in
better
taste
than
the
rigs
you
had
on
yesterday
though
those
were
far
gayer
you
do
know
a
lot
about
it
uncle
said
bernice
these
are
way
ahead
of
our
best
dresses
but
it
because
they
came
from
a
high
class
shop
and
when
you
get
the
bill
you
open
your
eyes
that
all
right
bernie
i
an
old
bachelor
you
know
and
never
before
have
i
had
the
privilege
of
buying
dresses
for
anybody
downright
glad
if
you
girls
are
pleased
with
these
and
i
downright
proud
of
the
little
cavalcade
setting
forth
from
my
house
the
courteous
old
gentleman
made
a
profound
bow
and
the
girls
curtseyed
in
response
then
off
they
went
to
the
party
as
berry
had
foretold
fine
clothes
were
the
order
of
the
day
at
the
brown
house
everything
was
as
formal
as
a
affair
the
girls
were
ushered
to
a
to
take
off
their
wraps
and
then
at
the
door
their
names
were
announced
by
an
personage
in
livery
and
they
were
swept
along
into
the
room
by
the
crush
of
others
behind
them
brown
and
her
daughter
were
receiving
and
they
greeted
each
arrival
with
gay
banter
and
smiles
ah
my
dears
how
do
you
do
said
brown
to
our
girls
i
am
so
glad
to
welcome
forbes
young
people
muriel
dear
these
are
the
girls
daddy
told
you
about
last
night
i
do
jolly
to
have
you
here
sweet
of
you
to
come
wish
i
could
more
but
i
see
you
after
the
rush
is
over
they
passed
in
line
saying
scarce
a
word
beyond
a
mere
greeting
and
following
the
example
of
their
predecessors
they
took
seats
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
large
auditorium
a
curtained
stage
faced
them
and
they
looked
about
at
the
fast
gathering
audience
it
was
a
merry
crowd
of
young
people
all
laughing
and
chattering
and
all
arrayed
in
beautiful
clothes
after
the
order
of
those
the
girls
wore
themselves
there
were
many
boys
present
too
and
they
moved
easily
about
joking
with
their
friends
here
and
there
presently
two
boys
drifted
toward
our
quartette
and
one
of
them
said
what
be
the
show
do
you
know
no
said
dotty
her
black
eyes
dancing
with
the
excitement
of
the
scene
what
do
you
guess
dunno
last
time
they
had
minstrels
and
the
time
before
a
magicker
legerdemain
yes
rabbits
out
of
hats
and
that
sort
ca
we
sit
here
engaged
no
and
dotty
smiled
as
she
looked
toward
the
other
girls
for
their
consent
oh
let
us
stay
said
the
other
boy
in
a
wheedling
voice
we
be
awfully
good
so
good
you
wo
know
us
we
do
know
you
anyway
laughed
alicia
and
the
first
boy
responded
sure
enough
roof
the
introduction
you
know
but
add
that
this
marvellously
handsome
companion
of
mine
is
one
geordie
knapp
and
i
ted
hosmer
very
much
at
your
service
well
said
alicia
we
miss
forbes
miss
fayre
miss
rose
and
miss
steele
shall
i
tell
you
which
is
which
or
let
you
guess
let
us
sherlock
it
out
exclaimed
geordie
knapp
i
know
you
miss
steele
because
you
mentioned
yourself
last
right
and
dotty
clapped
her
hands
in
admiration
of
his
quickness
now
which
am
i
rosy
posy
declared
ted
hosmer
little
thinking
he
had
guessed
correctly
but
saying
so
because
of
dotty
pink
cheeks
yes
sir
you
are
a
sherlock
holmes
now
which
is
miss
forbes
i
not
going
to
guess
any
more
i
spoil
my
record
and
ted
looked
uncertainly
from
dolly
to
bernice
but
as
you
two
are
named
forbes
and
fayre
i
call
you
both
miss
and
so
be
sure
of
you
and
then
the
curtain
began
to
rise
and
the
young
people
became
silent
the
entertainment
was
very
amusing
being
entirely
in
pantomime
and
performed
by
exceedingly
clever
actors
the
story
depicted
was
funny
and
the
antics
of
the
performers
were
novel
and
humorous
and
the
room
resounded
with
laughter
from
the
appreciative
audience
there
were
about
a
hundred
young
people
present
yet
the
large
room
was
only
partly
filled
dolly
concluded
as
she
looked
about
that
it
was
a
sort
of
small
theatre
where
brown
rehearsed
his
own
plays
in
this
she
was
partly
right
although
it
had
been
built
more
for
entertainment
of
the
actor
guests
james
brown
or
bayne
coriell
as
he
was
more
often
called
stood
very
high
in
his
profession
and
had
hosts
of
friends
and
acquaintances
his
wife
was
popular
too
and
muriel
was
just
beginning
to
take
her
place
in
society
after
the
pantomime
was
over
two
celebrated
dancers
gave
an
exhibition
of
their
skill
and
then
miss
marie
desmond
appeared
and
sang
two
of
her
songs
from
the
lass
and
the
lascar
dolly
was
enthralled
she
sat
listening
to
every
note
and
admiring
the
graceful
manner
and
deportment
of
miss
desmond
as
well
as
enjoying
her
music
well
you
seemed
to
care
for
that
miss
said
ted
hosmer
you
did
move
an
eyelash
while
marie
was
on
oh
i
did
enjoy
it
and
dolly
eyes
shone
with
delight
is
she
a
splendid
singer
top
notch
i
like
her
lots
hello
here
our
charming
hostess
the
programme
was
over
now
and
muriel
brown
sought
out
the
forbes
party
to
invite
them
to
the
refreshment
room
i
feel
that
i
know
you
she
laughed
from
dad
description
he
says
the
fair
girl
is
miss
fayre
and
the
rosy
girl
miss
rose
oh
that
it
is
it
cried
ted
then
this
is
miss
forbes
and
now
all
the
problems
are
solved
he
looked
at
bernice
who
acknowledged
the
fact
and
then
muriel
was
pounced
upon
by
a
rush
of
young
people
and
literally
carried
away
great
girl
muriel
said
young
hosmer
never
saw
such
a
favourite
i
say
may
we
take
you
girls
to
the
supper
room
or
do
you
eat
indeed
we
do
said
alicia
laughing
but
i
may
as
well
own
up
i
so
interested
in
looking
about
me
i
not
conscious
of
hunger
well
come
ahead
to
the
and
you
can
eat
and
look
about
at
the
same
time
i
corral
a
couple
more
henchmen
to
help
in
your
services
and
we
flock
by
ourselves
geordie
whistled
to
a
couple
of
his
chums
whom
he
presented
as
marly
turner
and
sam
graves
now
went
on
geordie
who
was
a
born
manager
we
eight
of
us
that
enough
for
a
table
to
our
own
selves
nail
one
samivel
the
way
to
the
lay
through
a
crush
of
guests
every
one
it
seemed
headed
in
a
different
direction
why
do
they
all
go
one
way
asked
dotty
few
of
eat
replied
ted
most
of
going
on
but
the
always
fine
here
and
anyway
you
girls
want
to
see
the
if
you
never
been
here
before
it
a
whole
show
it
was
the
splendid
great
room
with
vaulted
ceiling
represented
an
old
english
hall
there
was
a
raised
platform
across
the
end
and
a
gallery
on
either
side
fine
paintings
and
tapestries
adorned
the
walls
and
a
multitude
of
small
tables
offered
places
for
all
who
chose
to
sit
at
them
here
we
are
and
the
boys
decided
on
a
table
in
a
desirable
position
from
which
the
girls
could
see
the
gay
scene
now
for
some
supper
obsequious
waiters
appeared
and
soon
the
party
was
served
with
viands
fit
for
a
king
told
you
so
said
ted
trust
the
coriell
bunch
to
give
you
eats
oh
i
guess
yes
but
it
getting
so
late
sighed
dolly
as
she
caught
sight
of
an
old
english
clock
that
hung
near
by
and
brown
promised
me
i
could
speak
to
miss
desmond
i
afraid
she
be
gone
she
gone
now
said
ted
but
i
flee
and
discover
he
left
them
and
threaded
his
way
among
the
crowd
here
we
are
he
cried
gaily
as
he
returned
bringing
the
lady
in
question
just
caught
her
on
the
fly
trust
little
teddums
to
get
you
what
you
want
miss
fair
dolly
marie
desmond
greeted
the
girls
as
ted
named
them
you
lovely
kiddies
she
cried
what
a
delectable
bunch
i
could
eat
you
all
up
and
your
frocks
paris
i
know
you
need
tell
me
are
you
all
sisters
oh
no
i
remember
now
you
have
variegated
names
which
one
of
you
wanted
to
talk
to
me
i
a
whole
minute
to
spare
never
say
i
not
a
lady
of
leisure
i
the
one
said
dolly
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
lovely
laughing
face
of
the
actress
but
a
minute
is
no
good
thank
you
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
a
whole
day
oh
i
do
wish
we
could
manage
it
and
miss
desmond
appeared
to
think
that
was
the
one
thing
on
earth
she
desired
but
dolly
noted
her
wandering
attention
and
was
not
surprised
when
she
left
them
as
suddenly
as
she
had
come
and
with
a
fleeting
smiling
oh
is
she
exquisite
breathed
dolly
her
eyes
on
the
disappearing
figure
you
bet
she
is
assented
marly
turner
and
it
a
wonder
she
took
a
step
out
of
her
way
to
speak
to
us
kids
but
friends
of
coriell
of
course
is
she
so
very
busy
asked
dolly
her
eyes
wide
with
interest
well
she
a
society
belle
as
well
as
a
popular
actress
so
i
she
has
more
or
less
on
all
the
time
there
no
time
for
much
of
anything
in
new
york
i
say
ca
us
fellows
come
to
see
you
girls
when
where
i
do
know
said
dolly
mindful
of
the
coriell
episode
i
not
going
to
say
yes
till
i
know
what
right
i
ask
uncle
forbes
do
here
a
telephone
call
that
reach
us
let
us
come
soon
and
then
brown
appeared
spoke
a
few
words
to
the
girls
and
the
hoys
with
them
and
in
a
moment
everybody
was
going
home
our
girls
followed
the
example
set
them
said
their
went
to
the
for
their
wraps
and
bade
the
footman
at
the
door
call
the
forbes
car
chapter
x
a
skating
party
that
evening
in
the
forbes
questioned
the
girls
rather
closely
as
to
their
enjoyment
of
the
party
at
the
browns
i
liked
it
said
dolly
but
it
was
queer
that
what
it
was
queer
the
idea
of
just
seeing
a
performance
on
the
stage
and
then
rushing
through
a
very
fancy
supper
and
then
scooting
for
home
as
if
the
house
was
on
fire
that
not
my
idea
of
a
party
uncle
jeff
laughed
and
you
dotty
he
said
how
did
it
strike
you
i
adored
it
everybody
was
so
gay
and
smartly
dressed
and
i
do
like
to
hear
people
say
things
fast
how
queer
you
are
exclaimed
bernice
why
do
you
like
to
hear
people
talk
fast
not
talk
fast
exactly
but
say
things
suddenly
funny
things
i
mean
i
understand
said
forbes
you
mean
bright
at
repartee
and
yes
sir
that
just
what
i
do
mean
and
everything
was
so
well
planned
and
well
arranged
oh
i
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it
well
i
did
said
bernice
i
rather
go
to
a
regular
party
where
they
play
games
and
dance
and
act
sociable
why
the
people
were
sociable
enough
put
in
alicia
i
like
dot
i
thought
it
was
lovely
muriel
is
as
pretty
as
a
picture
she
scarcely
said
three
words
to
us
complained
bernice
she
could
help
that
there
were
so
many
guests
that
she
time
to
more
than
speak
a
minute
or
two
with
each
one
of
them
i
like
berwick
parties
better
persisted
bernice
there
we
all
know
each
other
but
bernie
said
dolly
laughing
all
the
people
at
this
party
knew
each
other
nearly
we
were
strangers
of
course
but
the
rest
seemed
to
be
well
acquainted
with
muriel
and
i
thought
the
party
was
to
be
for
us
went
on
bernice
and
i
thought
we
be
introduced
to
everybody
and
be
well
be
somebody
you
know
oho
you
wanted
to
be
honoured
and
lionised
and
uncle
jeff
eyes
twinkled
not
exactly
but
i
understood
from
brown
that
the
whole
affair
was
gotten
up
for
us
and
so
i
think
we
ought
to
have
been
noticed
more
why
the
boys
just
scraped
acquaintance
with
us
and
even
had
to
ask
our
names
that
the
way
they
do
at
large
parties
bernie
said
her
uncle
you
are
supposed
to
talk
to
any
of
the
other
guests
without
introduction
well
it
no
sort
of
a
way
they
were
awfully
nice
boys
but
i
suppose
we
ever
see
them
again
oh
yes
we
will
said
dolly
they
asked
to
call
on
us
and
i
said
i
ask
you
uncle
forbes
would
it
be
all
right
bless
my
soul
dolly
i
do
know
i
so
little
knowledge
of
etiquette
for
young
people
ask
berry
whatever
she
says
you
may
do
who
are
the
boys
hosmer
knapp
oh
they
all
right
i
know
the
families
but
as
to
their
calling
put
it
up
to
berry
and
by
the
way
how
you
girls
like
to
have
a
party
a
real
one
like
the
one
we
went
to
asked
bernice
doubtfully
i
care
much
about
it
well
have
some
other
kind
there
must
be
other
ways
of
entertaining
what
would
you
like
bernice
i
like
a
little
party
but
i
suppose
that
would
have
to
be
formal
too
oh
gracious
you
old
hayseed
exclaimed
alicia
you
go
back
to
the
country
i
love
to
have
a
party
uncle
the
biggest
and
grandest
there
is
muriel
brown
would
invite
the
people
for
us
i
sure
oh
it
would
be
just
heavenly
we
have
an
orchestra
and
a
midnight
supper
and
oh
and
everything
hold
on
my
child
do
go
too
fast
we
only
have
what
you
all
agree
on
come
two
d
what
do
you
say
we
ought
to
say
laughed
dolly
it
for
your
nieces
to
choose
and
anyway
dot
and
i
like
everything
and
we
enjoy
any
kind
of
a
party
or
no
party
at
all
you
a
nice
disposition
said
forbes
looking
at
her
you
ever
lose
your
temper
she
has
any
to
lose
dotty
answered
for
her
in
fact
she
too
awfully
for
any
use
but
she
has
other
faults
she
as
stubborn
as
a
perfectly
good
mule
are
you
dollums
i
i
am
and
the
golden
head
nodded
but
only
when
i
care
enough
to
be
stubborn
as
to
this
party
i
do
care
what
sort
it
is
i
know
it
will
be
lovely
anyway
that
is
if
we
have
it
but
seems
to
me
invitations
for
a
big
affair
ought
to
be
sent
out
several
days
in
advance
and
we
be
going
home
the
middle
of
next
week
why
you
only
just
got
here
said
forbes
well
it
friday
night
now
and
we
came
last
wednesday
for
a
week
so
if
we
go
home
next
wednesday
that
party
would
have
to
be
in
three
or
four
days
and
that
a
short
time
of
course
agreed
alicia
we
could
give
a
big
party
on
such
short
notice
that
easily
arranged
and
forbes
laughed
stay
another
week
oh
i
could
cried
dolly
my
mother
would
hear
of
such
a
thing
the
other
girls
can
though
i
would
if
doll
did
declared
dotty
but
bernie
and
alicia
could
stay
so
we
could
said
bernice
my
father
will
let
me
stay
as
long
as
uncle
jeff
wants
me
i
can
stay
too
said
alicia
but
it
lots
more
fun
to
have
you
other
girls
with
us
we
see
about
all
that
and
forbes
dismissed
the
subject
a
footman
came
in
to
say
that
miss
fayre
was
wanted
on
the
telephone
oh
cried
dolly
her
face
turning
white
do
you
suppose
any
wrong
at
home
mother
had
a
cold
maybe
it
developed
into
pneumonia
nonsense
child
do
borrow
trouble
probably
it
nothing
of
the
sort
is
that
dolly
all
over
said
alicia
after
dolly
had
left
the
room
she
always
thinks
the
worst
there
is
to
think
maybe
she
right
said
dotty
fayre
does
have
awful
colds
hark
i
hear
dolly
laughing
it
all
right
they
all
listened
and
they
heard
dolly
say
oh
perfectly
splendid

just
love
it
thank
you
yes
indeed
i
sure
oh
delightful
well
i
ask
her
fine
yes
yes
just
wait
a
minute
i
ask
her
now
hold
the
wire
followed
a
whispered
conversation
and
the
girls
caught
the
sound
of
berry
voice
unable
to
restrain
their
curiosity
longer
the
three
rushed
out
to
the
hall
and
saw
dolly
her
hand
over
the
transmitter
talking
to
berry
what
is
it
tell
us
all
cried
bernice
and
alicia
crowded
close
to
listen
oh
girls
and
dolly
beamed
at
them
it
the
loveliest
invitation
marly
turner
wants
us
to
go
to
a
skating
party
afternoon
at
valentine
rink
and
berry
says
it
will
be
all
right
for
us
to
go
yes
she
continued
speaking
into
the
telephone
yes
we
can
go
and
we
all
most
happy
to
accept
what
time
four
came
the
answer

our
crowd
at
the
rink
so
glad
you

dolly
and

so
much
said
turner
and
dolly
hung
up
the
receiver
tell
us
more
cried
alicia
what
did
you
hang
up
so
soon
for
why
did
you
let
us
talk
to
him
what
an
old
selfish
you
are
i
could
alicia
and
dolly
looked
hurt
i
knew
from
his
manner
and
speech
that
he
only
wanted
a
reply
to
his
invitation
and
i
expected
to
say
more
but
why
did
he
ask
for
you
grumbled
alicia
why
not
for
me
i
do
know
i
sure
and
dolly
laughed
he
did
that
all
go
and
tell
uncle
forbes
about
it
all
right
girls
all
right
glad
you
going
have
a
good
time
marly
turner
yes

son
of
the
bayard
turners
nice
boy
his
crowd

be
all
right
can
you
all
skate
did
you
bring
your
skates
if
not
get
some
get
whatever
you
want
look
as
good
as
the
rest
now
all
abruptly
as
usual
forbes
left
the
room
and
as
the
girls
were
getting
accustomed
to
his
eccentricities
they
nodded
their
and
then
began
to
plan
for
the
skating
party
berry
appeared
and
helped
them
decide
on
certain
details
of
costume
and
accessories
the
two
d
had
brought
the
pretty
skating
costumes
they
had
worn
at
the
berwick
carnival
but
as
bernice
had
been
the
queen
that
night
her
white
velvet
gown
was
out
of
the
question
alicia
too
had
no
appropriate
garb
so
these
two
bought
new
dresses
the
final
result
was
four
very
becomingly
attired
girls
who
started
merrily
off
on
saturday
afternoon
for
the
party
at
the
rink
four
bunches
of
violets
with
marly
turner
card
had
come
to
the
house
and
each
fair
damsel
wore
one
at
her
corsage
dolly
suit
was
of
light
blue
cloth
trimmed
with
silver
fox
and
dotty
was
red
cloth
with
dark
fur
bernice
looked
very
handsome
in
white
cloth
and
alicia
had
chosen
emerald
green
they
were
met
at
the
rink
by
marly
and
his
chums
and
at
once
introduced
to
the
chaperon
of
the
affair
who
was
marly
married
sister
she
did
look
much
older
than
the
boy
himself
but
she
greeted
the
girls
with
a
charming
hospitality
and
declared
herself
delighted
to
take
them
in
charge
the
other
boys
whom
they
had
met
at
muriel
party
were
there
and
muriel
was
too
she
welcomed
the
four
warmly
but
as
she
was
constantly
in
demand
by
other
gay
young
friends
they
had
no
chance
for
connected
conversation
with
her
indeed
connected
conversation
was
not
thought
of
unless
with
skating
partner
you
all
right
on
runners
commented
geordie
knapp
as
he
skated
with
dotty
you
must
be
fond
of
it
oh
i
am
i
skate
a
lot
at
home
that
is
when
there
ice
dependent
on
that
you
see
as
we
have
an
ice
rink
in
berwick
berwick
small
town
yes
as
big
as
a
minute
and
dotty
laughed
that
why
you
so
up
to
the
minute
then
geordie
laughed
back
want
to
sit
down
and
rest
a
bit
all
right
let
and
they
sat
down
for
a
few
moments
there
goes
your
chum
with
ted
hosmer
she
is
your
chum
is
she
the
fair
dolly
dolly
fayre

it

dotty
told
her
companion
all
about

and
its
delights

two
confabbing

out
a
voice
and
dolly
with
ted
hosmer
came
gliding
up
and
stopped
in
front
of
dot
and
young
knapp
settling
the
affairs
of
the
nation
said
geordie
also
it
a
case
of
partners
he
jumped
up
took
dolly
hands
in
his
and
they
swayed
off
across
the
ice
leaving
dotty
and
ted
together
do
mind
him
he
crazy
said
ted
as
he
dropped
onto
the
seat
beside
dotty

a
chance
to

muriel
make

upon

forbe

bernice

or
alicia
oh

minute
there
a
girl

sam
darted
off
and
another
boy
dropped
into
his
vacated
seat
it
was
this
touch
and
go
effect
that
dotty
liked
but
to
dolly
it
seemed
a
whirling
maze
and
indeed
almost
before
they
knew
it
they
were
all
whirled
off
home
chapter
xi
the
collections
on
sunday
dinner
was
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
directly
after
it
was
over
forbes
led
the
four
to
the
as
was
usual
in
the
evening
and
asked
an
account
of
the
dance
it
was
lovely
vouchsafed
dotty
gorgeous
agreed
bernice
perfectly
all
right
alicia
averred
nice
enough
but
very
grown
uppish
was
dolly
verdict
you
stick
to
your
taste
for
simpler
parties
said
forbes
looking
kindly
at
dolly
yes
sir
i
guess
i
a
country
girl
well
i
not
and
dotty
black
eyes
flashed
i
just
as
lief
live
in
berwick
to
be
sure
but
i
do
love
to
visit
in
new
york
and
see
all
the
grand
doings
and
was
the
party
grand
oh
it
was
uncle
said
alicia
it
was
small
and
it
was
early
pooh
cried
dolly
we
came
home
at
half
past
eleven
i
do
call
that
early
early
for
a
city
party
insisted
alicia
but
it
was
an
elaborate
affair
after
all
and
what
do
you
uncle
jeff
we
had
invitations
to
a
lot
of
things
next
week
and
the
week
after
too
well
you
girls
are
real
belles
they
do
seem
to
like
us
and
alicia
looked
very
well
which
one
of
you
do
they
like
the
best
teased
uncle
jeff
dotty
said
alicia
and
bernice
together
nothing
of
the
sort
declared
dotty
blushing
rosy
red
who
then
and
forbes
turned
to
her
why
i
do
know
said
dotty
still
embarrassed
dolly
i
guess
you
know
better
dot
and
dolly
laughed
at
her
i
think
uncle
forbes
the
most
citified
boys
and
girls
like
bernie
and
alicia
best
and
some
of
the
others
take
to
dot
and
me
her
honest
blue
eyes
proved
this
was
her
true
opinion
whatever
the
facts
might
be
well
look
here
and
forbes
eyes
twinkled
i
ask
you
two
dotty
and
dolly
which
of
my
two
nieces
is
a
greater
favourite
why
how
can
we
tell
that
right
before
them
both
cried
dolly
taking
it
as
a
joke
yes
i
want
you
to
tell
me
right
before
them
i
do
think
there
a
bit
of
difference
dotty
said
speaking
seriously
and
looking
at
the
two
girls
you
see
everybody
likes
bernie
and
they
all
like
alicia
you
a
diplomat
laughed
the
old
man
now
dolly
see
if
you
can
beat
that
dolly
liked
being
put
on
her
mettle
and
after
a
moment
thought
when
she
pretended
to
study
the
girls
she
said
they
are
both
liked
tremendously
for
themselves
but
more
because
they
are
your
nieces
capital
and
forbes
rubbed
his
hands
in
glee
you
a
tactful
young
person
i
do
avow
now
just
for
that
you
may
ask
anything
of
me
you
like
to
the
half
of
my
kingdom

ask

dolly
quickly

a
chance
to
repent
of
that
offer

kiddies
oh

the

after
him
up
to
the
fourth
floor
of
the
house
the
rooms
corresponded
to
those
below
stairs
but
all
were
arranged
as
a
museum
there
were
enormous
cases
filled
with
specimens
of
every
sort
of
bird
butterfly
or
insect
or
if
not
every
kind
was
represented
surely
they
were
nearly
all
there
so
multitudinous
were
the
exhibits
what
a
lot
exclaimed
dolly
i
had
no
idea
it
was
such
an
enormous
collection
yes
said
forbes
with
justifiable
pride
it
is
the
largest
private
collection
that
i
know
of
come
let
me
show
you
the
birds
first
obediently
the
girls
followed
his
directions
and
with
ever
growing
interest
they
saw
the
rows
and
rows
of
stuffed
birds
of
all
sizes
and
of
all
varieties
of
plumage
then
came
great
cabinets
filled
with
shallow
drawers
each
of
which
when
opened
displayed
tiny
moths
queer
flies
and
microscopic
insects
each
daintily
mounted
on
its
own
pin
and
all
standing
in
trim
rows
the
butterflies
were
the
prettiest
exhibit
of
all
these
showed
rare
varieties
and
ones
specimens
from
far
distant
countries
and
from
their
own
state
all
the
girls
were
interested
but
dolly
was
absorbed
she
walked
from
case
to
case
asking
intelligent
questions
that
forbes
was
glad
to
answer
you
ought
to
make
natural
history
a
special
study
he
said
to
her
you
seem
so
fond
of
it
oh
i
am
responded
dolly
i
shall
try
to
get
mother
to
let
me
take
it
up
specially
next
year
and
here
are
the
beetles
how
wonderfully
they
are
arranged
and
what
beautiful
colours
yes
see
the
iridescent
wings
of
this
chap
and
uncle
jeff
pointed
to
a
fine
specimen
i
do
wonder
the
old
egyptians
loved
this
creature
and
carved
their
scarabs
in
its
likeness
do
you
no
indeed
responded
dolly
and
do
you
like
old
egyptian
things
too
so
do
i
saw
wonders
in
the
museum
i
have
quite
an
antique
collection
if
you
interested
if
i
interested
well
i
just
guess
i
am
the
other
girls
enjoyed
the
exhibition
too
but
not
so
much
as
dolly
who
was
enthusiastic
over
it
all
they
had
so
far
seen
only
the
front
rooms
but
now
uncle
jeff
conducted
them
to
the
room
in
the
rear
extension
of
the
house
and
as
he
unlocked
the
door
he
said
here
are
my
greatest
treasures
of
all
the
girls
went
in
and
forbes
rolled
up
the
shades
and
let
in
the
sunlight
my
but
it
close
and
stuffy
exclaimed
bernice
may
we
have
a
window
open
uncle
yes
indeed
i
believe
in
fresh
air
but
i
keep
this
room
closed
so
much
of
the
time
it
does
get
stale
forbes
threw
open
a
window
that
faced
the
south
and
as
there
was
no
wind
blowing
the
fresh
winter
air
was
balmy
and
pleasant
that
better
said
bernice
and
she
began
to
look
at
the
treasures
all
about
her
there
were
many
tall
cases
like
and
on
their
shelves
were
ranged
curios
and
valuables
of
all
sorts
these
proved
more
interesting
to
dotty
than
the
birds
and
butterflies
oh
look
at
the
old
jewellery
she
cried
just
like
what
we
saw
in
the
museum
doll
yes
here
are
old
egyptian
trinkets
are
they
uncle
forbes
yes
those
are
egyptian
and
abyssinian
this
nose
ring
was
worn
by
a
lady
in
india
some
centuries
before
you
girls
were
born
what
is
the
oldest
thing
you
have
uncle
asked
alicia
this
jewellery
no
this
is
my
oldest
piece
and
forbes
took
from
a
shelf
an
image
of
a
cat
it
was
of
dark
brown
material
and
was
dingy
and
roughened
as
if
by
fire
this
came
from
an
old
egyptian
tomb
he
said
you
know
they
put
all
sorts
of
idols
and
charms
in
the
tombs
of
their
dead
then
once
in
a
while
these
things
are
exhumed
and
in
some
instances
sold
by
the
egyptian
museum
authorities
i
buy
only
what
is
guaranteed
by
them
to
be
genuine
i
have
an
agent
who
has
travelled
in
many
countries
to
collect
authentic
antiquities
for
me
this
cat
dates
from
about
gracious
cried
dotty
and
there
been
nearly
two
thousand
years
since
that
makes
cat
about
four
thousand
years
old
some
cat
well
a
cat
has
nine
lives
anyway
laughed
alicia
so
it
ought
to
be
a
long
time
dead
that
never
was
a
live
cat
was
it
asked
dolly
oh
no
this
was
a
bronze
image
but
fire
and
age
have
turned
it
to
a
mere
brittle
shell
if
it
were
dropped
to
the
floor
it
would
break
into
a
thousand
pieces
oh
my
take
it
exclaimed
dolly
who
was
holding
the
precious
relic
i
did
know
it
was
so
fragile
forbes
took
it
carefully
that
why
i
do
often
bring
young
people
up
here
they
too
heedless
to
appreciate
the
value
of
these
old
things
yes
two
centuries
before
the
christian
era
this
piece
of
as
we
would
call
it
adorned
the
tomb
of
some
egyptian
citizen
i
have
the
guarantee
signed
by
the
egyptian
museum
and
here
is
a
fine
specimen
this
is
in
a
better
state
of
preservation
see
you
can
read
the
date
on
it
clearly
forbes
took
from
a
cabinet
a
small
image
of
a
mummy
it
was
of
blue
stone
somewhat
chipped
and
worn
but
preserving
its
shape
and
colour
on
the
back
in
rude
figures
but
clearly
discernible
was
the
date
to
which
he
called
their
attention
wonderful
said
alicia
their
figures
are
much
like
ours
they
yes
my
child
the
arabic
numerals
are
of
ancient
usage
think
of
the
old
hand
that
carved
that
date
long
since
mouldered
to
dust
it
gives
me
the
creeps
declared
bernice
and
yet
it
fascinates
me
too
was
this
found
in
a
tomb
yes
or
in
a
temple
excavations
in
egypt
latterly
produce
so
many
of
these
things
that
it
is
not
difficult
to
get
them
but
that
pretty
old
you
see
half
a
century
before
christ
i
wonder
who
was
king
of
egypt
then
said
dotty
i
wish
i
could
remember
my
history
better
i
learned
about
the
ptolemies
and
the
other
dynasties
but
i
get
all
mixed
up
although
the
others
were
eagerly
examining
the
old
mummy
relic
dolly
stood
looking
at
it
thoughtfully
may
i
take
it
she
said
after
the
others
had
scrutinised
it
dolly
handled
it
carefully
as
she
minutely
observed
it
on
every
side
it
was
about
six
inches
long
and
was
a
perfect
little
model
of
an
egyptian
mummy
she
gazed
at
the
date
deeply
graven
on
the
back
and
then
with
a
slight
smile
she
handed
it
back
to
forbes
saying
very
good
eddie
what
what
do
you
mean
cried
the
old
gentleman
glaring
at
her
and
alicia
exclaimed
why
dolly
fayre
you
rude
little
thing
but
what
do
you
mean
persisted
forbes
why
do
you
call
me
eddie
oh
and
dolly
laughed
that
a
slang
phrase
that
people
say
when
they
see
through
a
joke
joke
miss
are
you
making
fun
of
my
antiques
explain
yourself
yes
what
do
you
mean
dolly
said
dotty
anxiously
you
ca
mean
to
insult
mr
forbes
you
goosies
cried
dolly
he
fooling
you
it
a
joke
on
us
what
is
what
a
joke
this
mummy
and
now
forbes
had
joined
in
dolly
laughter
you
a
cute
one
he
said
not
one
person
in
a
dozen
catches
on
to
that
tell
my
dear
oh
you
are
a
smart
one
forbes
shook
with
glee
and
dolly
held
up
the
image
to
the
mystified
girls
do
you
see
you
blindies
the
date
could
have
been
put
on
in
the
year
b
why
not
asked
alicia
looking
blank
why
at
that
time
they
did
know
how
many
years
it
would
be
before
christ
birth
nobody
dated
anything
until
after
the
christian
era
had
begun
but
why
did
they
and
bernice
also
looked
bewildered
think
a
minute
you
sillies
nobody
knew
the
exact
date
of
the
year
one
until
after
the
year
one
was
here
in
fact
i
do
think
they
began
to
count
right
away
anyhow
but
certainly
they
did
know
five
hundred
and
years
before
oh
i
see
cried
bernice
all
the
years
have
been
computed
or
dated
since
the
years
began
of
course
they
have
and
forbes
had
the
date
carved
on
this
mummy
on
purpose
to
fool
people
did
you
yes
chuckled
forbes
and
it
has
fooled
lots
of
people
older
and
wiser
than
you
little
dolly
fayre
i
think
you
pretty
smart
to
notice
the
fraud
oh
no
but
it
just
happened
to
occur
to
me
that
i
never
seen
a
date
marked
before
and
then
i
thought
at
once
that
it
could
be
pretty
cute
all
the
same
you
other
girls
did
see
it
no
we
did
admitted
dotty
i
own
up
i
was
fooled
i
never
thought
of
the
absurdity
of
the
thing
did
you
make
up
the
joke
no
i
bought
the
mummy
from
a
dealer
who
sold
a
few
of
them
for
the
purpose
of
it
a
pretty
good
joke
it
was
and
though
the
girls
felt
a
little
chagrined
at
being
taken
in
they
were
generous
enough
to
appreciate
dolly
cleverness
and
be
glad
of
it
a
case
of
antique
jewellery
proved
interesting
to
all
the
queer
ornaments
worn
by
the
ancients
were
admired
and
studied
by
the
girls
and
forbes
enjoyed
telling
of
their
histories
this
earring
he
said
is
perhaps
the
gem
of
the
whole
collection
it
is
byzantine
and
is
of
wonderfully
delicate
workmanship
the
filigree
gold
ornament
was
a
long
and
slender
pendant
of
intricate
gold
work
and
studded
with
tiny
jewels
it
was
one
of
a
pair
of
earrings
and
they
wondered
where
its
mate
might
be
if
indeed
it
was
yet
in
existence
it
would
make
a
fine
lavalliere
said
dolly
holding
it
up
against
her
chest
and
glancing
in
a
nearby
mirror
see
and
she
hooked
the
trinket
into
the
lace
at
her
throat
is
it
becoming
very
laughed
bernice
and
turned
to
see
what
dotty
was
now
exclaiming
over
it
proved
to
be
a
bracelet
that
legend
said
had
been
worn
by
cleopatra
though
forbes
frankly
acknowledged
he
did
believe
this
let
me
take
it
by
the
light
said
alicia
it
getting
dusk
in
here
she
took
the
bracelet
to
the
open
window
and
admired
the
beauty
of
its
wrought
gold
here
take
it
uncle
jeff
she
said
i
declare
i
almost
afraid
to
handle
these
valuable
things
for
fear
i
should
suddenly
become
a
kleptomaniac
said
her
uncle
laughing
i
not
afraid
or
i
should
have
brought
you
girls
up
here
i
do
mind
admitting
i
have
one
friend
a
wise
old
octogenarian
rich
as
croesus
whom
i
trust
up
here
alone
he
steal
a
gem
as
quickly
as
a
highway
robber
would
how
awful
said
bernice
just
because
of
his
craze
for
antiques
yes
you
know
some
people
are
carried
quite
out
of
themselves
by
a
pet
hobby
well
girls
it
is
getting
dusk
let
go
downstairs
and
have
a
little
chat
over
what
you
seen
i
like
to
see
how
much
you
remember
of
what
i
told
you
shall
i
shut
the
window
uncle
jeff
asked
bernice
no
leave
it
open
a
little
air
will
do
the
room
good
i
see
to
it
later
the
girls
left
the
room
forbes
followed
and
locking
the
door
pocketed
the
key
and
they
all
went
downstairs
chapter
xii
the
lost
jewel
a
pleasant
hour
was
spent
in
the
library
as
forbes
told
the
girls
anecdotes
connected
with
his
treasures
and
also
catechised
them
on
what
they
had
learned
from
their
afternoon
in
his
museum
dolly
had
taken
the
greatest
interest
in
it
though
bernice
soon
proved
that
she
had
the
best
memory
of
them
all
for
she
could
tell
dates
and
data
that
her
uncle
had
informed
them
and
which
the
others
more
often
forgot
i
have
any
memory
sighed
dolly
but
i
do
love
to
see
these
things
and
hear
about
them
it
lots
of
work
is
it
to
get
them
all
properly
catalogued
and
labelled
yes
it
keeps
fenn
pretty
busy
and
often
i
bring
in
an
assistant
for
him
but
fenn
is
a
clever
chap
and
a
quick
worker
their
chat
was
interrupted
by
geordie
knapp
and
ted
hosmer
who
came
over
to
call
on
the
girls
come
right
in
boys
glad
to
see
you
was
forbes
hearty
greeting
i
should
wonder
if
our
young
friends
here
would
be
glad
too
they
spent
the
whole
afternoon
with
my
old
fogy
talk
and
warrant
they
be
glad
of
a
change
you
stay
with
us
uncle
and
enjoy
the
change
too
laughed
alicia
as
forbes
was
leaving
the
room
no
no
it
does
seem
to
occur
to
you
that
i
like
a
rest
from
a
crowd
of
his
merry
smile
belied
his
words
and
he
went
off
leaving
the
young
people
together
berry
looked
in
and
hospitably
invited
the
boys
to
stay
to
supper
which
they
willingly
agreed
to
do
also
they
stayed
an
hour
or
more
after
supper
and
when
at
last
they
departed
the
four
girls
remained
in
the
library
talking
things
over
to
their
surprise
forbes
came
to
the
room
and
without
a
word
sat
down
facing
the
group
something
in
his
expression
caused
the
girls
to
stop
their
laughter
and
chatter
for
the
old
gentleman
looked
decidedly
serious
well
my
dears
and
he
looked
from
one
to
another
have
you
had
a
pleasant
day
yes
indeed
spoke
up
alicia
and
they
all
added
words
of
assent
well
i
have
said
forbes
and
they
looked
up
at
him
with
a
startled
air
that
is
i
have
just
made
a
discovery
that
makes
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
of
my
life
what
is
it
uncle
what
is
the
matter
alicia
spoke
solicitously
as
if
she
feared
her
uncle
had
become
suddenly
i
have
met
with
a
loss
a
loss
queried
bernice
what
have
you
lost
one
of
my
dearest
possessions
i
went
to
my
museum
just
now
to
that
rear
room
which
we
were
in
last
and
i
discovered
that
one
of
my
valuable
pieces
of
jewellery
is
gone
the
girls
stared
at
him
blankly
and
at
last
bernice
said
which
one
the
byzantine
earring
the
gold
filigree
piece
oh
cried
alicia
that
lovely
piece
why
where
can
it
be
i
do
know
replied
her
uncle
slowly
i
searched
everywhere
and
as
i
could
find
it
i
came
down
here
to
ask
if
you
girls
had
taken
it
as
as
a
joke
on
me
no
indeed
exclaimed
alicia
i
scorn
to
do
such
a
mean
trick
none
of
us
would
think
of
such
a
thing
would
we
girls
no
indeed
said
they
all
and
then
a
silence
fell
where
could
the
jewel
be
as
always
in
moments
of
excitement
dolly
turned
very
pale
while
dotty
flushed
furiously
red
alicia
sat
her
big
eyes
staring
with
dismay
and
bernice
nervously
picked
at
her
handkerchief
come
now
said
forbes
if
any
of
you
girls
did
take
it
in
jest
give
it
up
for
it
is
a
funny
joke
at
all
oh
we
did
i
sure
none
of
us
did
and
dolly
almost
wailed
in
her
earnest
denial
of
course
we
did
declared
dotty
angrily
you
ought
to
know
we
not
that
sort
of
girls
it
must
have
been
mislaid
or
pushed
behind
something
that
conceals
it
from
view
probably
you
right
and
forbes
looked
at
her
intently
probably
the
solution
of
its
disappearance
i
have
fenn
make
search
i
sorry
i
bothered
you
about
it
with
his
funny
abruptness
he
left
the
room
and
the
girls
sat
looking
at
each
other
in
amazement
did
you
ever
hear
anything
like
that
demanded
dotty
furiously
the
idea
of
thinking
we
would
do
such
a
thing
i
hate
practical
jokes
unless
among
a
lot
of
school
chums
i
would
think
of
playing
a
joke
on
a
uncle
jeff
has
had
much
experience
with
young
folks
put
in
alicia
by
way
of
excuse
for
their
host
you
know
he
always
lives
alone
and
he
does
know
what
girls
would
or
would
do
but
how
awful
for
that
thing
to
be
lost
mused
bernice
suppose
it
fell
down
behind
a
case
or
somewhere
and
he
never
finds
it
oh
his
secretary
will
find
it
said
dolly
hopefully
it
must
be
somewhere
around
do
let
talk
about
it
if
we
do
i
sha
sleep
a
wink
all
night
i
never
do
if
i
worry
i
think
it
something
to
worry
about
said
alicia
it
the
worst
blow
uncle
jeff
could
have
you
know
how
he
adores
his
treasures
why
he
rather
lose
everything
from
these
downstairs
than
one
specimen
out
of
those
fourth
story
rooms
and
that
gold
earring
of
all
things
i
tell
you
stop
talking
about
it
and
dolly
clapped
her
hands
over
her
ears
please
humour
me
in
this
she
added
smiling
a
little
truly
it
will
keep
me
awake
if
i
get
to
worrying
over
it
all
right
girls
let
drop
the
subject
also
let
go
to
bed
it
was
alicia
who
spoke
and
she
seemed
under
great
excitement
her
eyes
were
unnaturally
bright
and
her
cheeks
were
pink
and
she
moved
jerkily
as
if
nervous
so
the
four
went
up
to
their
rooms
and
saying
they
closed
the
door
of
communication
between
what
the
matter
dollums
asked
dotty
as
she
saw
tears
in
the
blue
eyes
nothing
dot
only
do
talk
about
that
gold
thing
will
you
i
just
simply
ca
stand
it
if
you
do
i
wo
if
you
do
want
me
to
only
what
do
you
did
become
of
it
there
you
go
i
think
you
too
mean
for
anything
oh
pshaw
i
did
mean

i
forgot
all
right

old
rubbish

all
i
rather
go
to
sleep

then
old
crossy
but
i
you

mean
to
sleep
in
your
clothes

and
dolly
laughed
a
little
i
know
i
an
old
bear
and
a
crosspatch
and
everything
horrid
but
i
nervous
dotty
i
am
i
know
it
old
girl
but
you
get
over
it
i
believe
this
city
life
is
wearing
you
out
i
believe
it
time
you
went
home
oh
i
think
so
too
i
wish
we
could
go
tomorrow
well
we
ca
what
has
got
into
you
dollyrinda
i
believe
homesick
i
am
dotty
i
give
anything
to
see
mother
i
wish
i
was
home
in
my
own
room
you
be
there
soon
enough
i
we
go
wednesday
wednesday
that
seems
ages
off
why
dollums
you
can
say
wednesday
is
day
after
that
what
i
always
do
if
i
want
to
hurry
up
the
days
but
i
want
to
hurry
up
our
days
in
new
york
no
i
love
every
one
of
wish
we
could
stay
a
month
i
do
and
then
there
were
few
more
words
said
between
the
two
that
night
soon
they
were
in
bed
and
if
dolly
lay
awake
dotty
did
know
it
for
she
fell
asleep
almost
as
soon
as
her
dark
curly
head
touched
its
pillow
meantime
in
the
next
room
the
other
two
were
talking
i
do
hope
uncle
jeff
will
find
his
old
jewel
bernice
said
pettishly
we
wo
have
a
bit
more
fun
if
he
does
that
so
agreed
alicia
but
he
wo
find
it
how
do
you
know
oh
it
very
likely
fallen
down
some
crack
or
somewhere
that
nobody
think
of
looking
why
once
a
photograph
was
on
our
mantel
and
it
disappeared
most
mysteriously
and
we
never
could
find
it
and
after
years
there
was
a
new
mantelpiece
put
in
and
there
was
the
picture
it
had
slipped
down
a
narrow
mite
of
a
crack
between
the
and
the
wall
back
of
it
tell
uncle
jeff
that
maybe
it
will
help
him
to
find
the
thing
all
right
i
will
but
of
course
fenn
will
look
everywhere
possible
i
do
believe
anybody
ever
find
it
then
uncle
will
be
cast
down
and
upset
all
the
rest
of
the
time
here
well
i
ca
help
that
what
do
you
suppose
bernice
he
asked
us
here
for
anyway
you
ask
me
that
a
hundred
dozen
times
a
day
i
tell
you
i
do
know
but
i
think
it
was
only
a
whim
you
know
how
queer
he
is
he
forgets
we
in
this
house
from
one
evening
to
the
next
if
had
been
sunday
we
would
have
seen
him
this
afternoon
i
wish
we
were
going
to
stay
another
week
so
do
i
but
i
do
like
to
ask
him
outright
and
he
has
said
anything
about
it
lately
the
others
could
stay
anyway
oh
i
do
know
i
think
if
they
were
invited
their
mothers
would
let
them
and
anyway
i
rather
stay
without
them
than
to
go
home
yes
i
would
too
dot
likes
it
better
than
dolly
yes
dolly
homesick
anybody
can
see
that
but
they
like
it
when
we
go
to
places
and
see
sights
who
would
we
really
having
times
you
know
i
know
it
i
shall
hate
to
go
back
to
school
well
i
do
hate
to
go
home
i
have
good
enough
times
in
berwick
but
i
like
to
stay
here
one
week
more
i
think
i
ask
uncle
jeff
to
let
us
if
he
does
ask
us
himself
wait
till
he
finds
his
lost
treasure
he
be
pretty
blue
if
he
does
get
that
back
yes
indeed
he
will
let
hope
the
fenn
man
will
spy
it
out
it
must
be
in
that
room
somewhere
you
know
of
course
it
must
the
secretary
will
find
it
that
what
secretaries
are
for
and
then
silence
and
sleep
descended
on
that
room
also
next
morning
forbes
appeared
at
the
breakfast
table
this
was
the
first
time
they
had
ever
seen
him
in
the
morning
and
the
girls
greeted
him
cheerily
very
nice
he
said
affably
to
come
down
and
breakfast
with
a
flock
of
fresh
young
rosebuds
like
you
and
he
seemed
so
that
alicia
decided
he
had
taken
his
loss
more
easily
than
she
had
feared
but
toward
the
end
of
the
meal
forbes
made
known
the
reason
of
his
early
appearance
we
ca
find
that
earring
he
said
suddenly
fenn
and
i
have
been
looking
since
six
this
morning
now
i
going
to
ask
you
girls
to
help
me
will
you
all
come
up
to
the
museum
and
hunt
your
young
eyes
may
discern
it
where
we
older
seekers
have
failed
at
any
rate
i
like
you
to
try
the
four
expressed
ready
willingness
and
they
rose
from
the
table
and
followed
uncle
jeff
up
the
stairs
to
the
rear
room
where
the
loss
had
occurred
the
sun
shone
in
at
the
southern
windows
and
flooded
the
room
with
brightness
it
seemed
impossible
to
overlook
the
treasure
and
surely
it
must
be
found
at
once
a
youngish
man
was
there
before
them
and
he
was
introduced
as
the
secretary
lewis
fenn
was
a
grave
looking
chap
who
it
was
evident
took
seriously
the
responsibility
of
his
position
as
tabulator
and
in
part
custodian
of
valuable
treasures
he
bowed
to
the
girls
but
said
nothing
beyond
a
word
of
greeting
to
each
you
see
said
forbes
i
locked
this
room
myself
after
you
girls
last
evening
and
nobody
could
get
in
to
take
the
earring
consequently
it
would
seem
that
a
close
search
must
be
efficacious
so
let
us
all
set
to
and
see
what
we
can
do
in
the
way
of
discovery
let
divide
the
room
in
four
suggested
fenn
and
one
of
you
young
ladies
take
each
quarter
good
idea
commented
uncle
jeff
and
we
do
just
that
alicia
you
take
this
west
end
next
the
door
bernice
the
east
end
opposite
dotty
the
north
side
and
dolly
the
south
side
there
that
fixes
it
now
to
work
all
of
you
i
exhausted
my
powers
of
search
and
so
has
fenn
the
two
men
sat
down
in
the
middle
of
the
room
while
the
girls
eagerly
began
to
search
they
were
told
not
to
look
in
the
cases
but
merely
on
tables
or
any
place
around
the
room
where
the
jewel
might
have
fallen
or
been
laid
who
had
it
last
asked
fenn
as
the
girls
searched
here
and
there
nobody
seemed
to
know
exactly
and
then
alicia
said
suddenly
why
do
you
know
dolly
hooked
it
onto
the
front
of
her
dress
and
said
it
would
make
a
lovely
pendant
but
i
took
it
off
said
dolly
turning
white
where
did
you
put
it
then
asked
fenn
not
unkindly
but
curiously
let
me
see
faltered
dolly
i
do
quite
remember
i
guess
i
laid
it
on
this
table
if
so
it
must
be
there
now
my
dear
said
forbes
suavely
look
thoroughly
dolly
did
look
thoroughly
and
dotty
came
over
to
help
her
but
the
earring
was
not
on
the
table
nor
was
it
on
other
tables
that
were
about
the
room
nor
on
any
chair
or
shelf
or
settee
or
where
can
it
be
said
dotty
greatly
alarmed
lest
dolly
having
fastened
it
to
her
dress
should
have
been
the
means
of
losing
it
are
you
sure
you
removed
it
from
your
frock
miss
fayre
asked
fenn
and
at
that
moment
dolly
took
a
dislike
to
the
man
his
voice
was
low
and
pleasant
but
the
inflection
was
meaning
and
he
seemed
to
imply
that
dolly
might
have
worn
it
from
the
room
of
course
i
am
dolly
replied
in
a
scared
low
voice
which
trembled
as
she
spoke
there
an
idea
said
forbes
might
you
have
left
it
hooked
into
your
lace
dolly
and
it
there
still
run
and
look
my
dear
i
go
with
you
said
dotty
but
fenn
said
no
miss
rose
better
stay
here
dotty
was
so
astonished
at
his
dictum
that
she
stood
still
and
stared
at
him
dolly
ran
off
to
her
room
on
the
second
floor
and
carefully
examined
the
dress
she
had
worn
the
day
before
no
she
said
on
her
return
it
is
on
my
dress
i
knew
it
could
be
i
should
have
seen
it
when
i
undressed
besides
i
know
i
took
it
off
here
only
a
moment
after
i
tried
it
on
i
merely
looked
at
it
an
instant
and
then
i
unhooked
it
and
laid
it
on
this
table
but
at
first
you
were
sure
that
you
did
place
it
on
that
table
miss
fayre
came
the
insinuating
voice
of
fenn
once
more
yes
i
did
i
sure
of
it
now
and
dolly
white
face
was
drawn
with
anxiety
think
again
counselled
the
secretary
maybe
you
took
it
off
and
slipped
it
in
your
pocket
chapter
xiii
suspicions
dotty
turned
on
fenn
like
a
little
fury
what
do
you
mean
she
cried
are
you
accusing
dolly
of
stealing
that
thing
there
there
said
forbes
placatingly
of
course
fenn
mean
that
not
intentionally
that
is
but
without
thinking
could
no
she
could
stormed
dotty
dolly
fayre
does
go
around
pocketing
people
jewels
unconsciously
she
is
a
kleptomaniac
or
whatever
you
call
it
she
did
exactly
as
she
says
she
did
she
laid
that
earring
on
that
table
then
why
is
it
there
now
asked
fenn
because
somebody
else
moved
it
oh
do
ask
me
who
i
do
know
who
and
i
do
care
who
but
dolly
put
it
there
and
whoever
took
it
away
from
there
can
find
it
perhaps
you
can
mr
fenn
the
secretary
looked
at
the
angry
girl
with
an
irritating
smile
i
wish
i
might
miss
rose
but
i
searched
the
room
thoroughly
as
you
all
have
too
it
ca
be
here
you
know
i
tell
you
said
alicia
eagerly
and
then
she
described
how
in
her
home
a
photograph
had
slipped
down
behind
the
mantel
and
had
been
lost
for
years
let
us
see
and
forbes
went
to
the
mantel
in
the
room
but
there
was
not
the
least
mite
of
a
crack
between
the
shelf
and
the
wall
alicia
suggestion
was
useless
but
she
said
there
might
be
that
sort
of
a
somewhere
else
let
look
all
over
the
girls
tried
hard
to
find
some
crack
or
crevice
in
any
piece
of
furniture
into
which
the
trinket
might
have
slipped
but
there
was
none
they
felt
down
between
backs
and
seats
of
chairs
looked
behind
cases
of
treasures
moved
every
book
and
paper
that
lay
on
the
tables
even
turned
up
the
edges
of
rugs
and
peeped
under
it
does
make
any
difference
how
much
we
look
dotty
declared
we
just
got
to
look
more
that
all
why
that
earring
is
in
this
room
and
that
all
there
is
about
that
now
it
up
to
us
to
find
it
you
know
after
you
search
all
the
possible
places
you
have
to
search
the
impossible
ones
i
admire
your
perseverance
said
forbes
but
i
ca
hope
it
will
be
rewarded
it
is
as
if
we
were
hunting
for
a
thing
that
somebody
had
purposely
concealed
that
would
mean
an
exhaustive
search
but
we
looking
for
something
merely
mislaid
or
tossed
aside
and
if
we
find
it
it
will
be
in
some
exposed
place
not
cleverly
hidden
oh
i
do
know
uncle
jeff
said
bernice
you
know
when
photograph
slipped
behind
the
mantel
that
was
deeply
hidden
although
not
purposely
yes
that
so
and
uncle
jeff
looked
questioningly
from
one
girl
to
another
it
was
impossible
to
ignore
the
fact
that
he
deemed
one
of
them
responsible
for
the
disappearance
of
the
jewel
and
until
the
matter
was
cleared
up
all
felt
under
suspicion
fenn
too
was
studying
the
four
young
faces
as
if
to
detect
signs
of
guilt
in
one
of
them
at
last
he
said
let
us
get
at
this
systematically
who
took
the
earring
first
when
forbes
handed
it
out
from
the
case
i
did
said
dotty
promptly
i
stood
nearest
to
forbes
and
he
handed
it
to
me
after
i
looked
at
it
i
passed
it
to
alicia
no
you
did
contradicted
alicia
i
did
touch
it
why
yes
dotty
persisted
you
took
it
and
said
i
tell
you
i
did
i
never
handled
the
things
at
all
it
was
bernice
i
did
have
it
in
my
hands
said
bernice
reflectively
but
i
remember
whether
i
took
it
from
dot
or
alicia
i
did
touch
it
i
tell
you
and
alicia
frowned
angrily
oh
yes
you
did
said
dolly
it
was
you
alicia
who
passed
it
on
to
me
and
i
took
it
you
did
take
it
from
me
dolly
and
alicia
grew
red
with
passion
i
vow
i
never
touched
it
you
took
it
from
bernice
no
said
dolly
trying
to
think
i
took
it
from
you
and
i
held
it
up
and
asked
you
how
it
looked
no
doll
you
asked
me
that
said
bernice
and
i
said
it
was
very
becoming
you
girls
seem
decidedly
mixed
as
to
what
you
did
said
fenn
with
a
slight
laugh
i
think
you
not
trying
to
remember
very
clearly
hold
on
fenn
said
forbes
reprovingly
it
in
the
favour
that
they
do
remember
clearly
if
they
tossed
the
thing
aside
carelessly
they
naturally
would
remember
but
forbes
and
the
secretary
spoke
earnestly
would
these
young
ladies
toss
a
valuable
gem
away
carelessly
they
are
not
ignorant
children
they
all
knew
that
the
earring
is
a
choice
possession
sure
not
one
of
them
would
toss
it
aside
unheeding
where
it
might
fall
this
was
perfectly
true
none
of
the
four
girls
could
have
been
so
heedless
as
that
they
had
carefully
handled
every
gem
or
curio
shown
them
and
then
returned
it
to
forbes
as
a
matter
of
course
fenn
speech
was
rather
a
facer
all
had
to
admit
its
truth
and
the
four
girls
looked
from
one
to
another
and
then
at
forbes
he
was
studying
them
intently
bernice
and
dolly
were
crying
alicia
and
dotty
were
and
if
one
of
the
four
had
a
secret
sense
of
guilt
it
was
difficult
to
guess
which
one
it
might
be
for
all
were
in
a
state
of
excitement
and
were
hysterical
much
as
i
regret
it
forbes
began
i
am
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
one
or
more
of
you
girls
knows
something
of
the
present
whereabouts
of
my
lost
jewel
i
do
not
say
i
suspect
any
of
you
of
wilful
it
might
be
you
had
accidentally
carried
it
off
and
now
feel
embarrassed
about
returning
it
i
ca
i
wo
believe
that
any
of
you
deliberately
took
it
with
intent
to
keep
it
we
thank
you
for
that
forbes
and
dotty
tone
and
the
expression
of
her
face
denoted
deepest
sarcasm
it
is
a
comfort
to
know
that
you
do
not
call
us
thieves
but
for
my
part
i
think
it
is
about
as
bad
to
accuse
us
of
concealing
knowledge
of
the
matter
i
think
you
better
search
our
trunks
and
suitcases
and
then
if
you
please
i
should
like
to
go
home
no
doubt
you
would
miss
rose
broke
in
fenn
cold
voice
a
search
of
your
belongings
would
be
useless
if
one
of
you
is
concealing
the
jewel
it
would
not
be
found
in
any
available
place
of
search
you
would
have
put
it
some
place
in
the
house
not
easy
of
discovery
that
would
not
be
difficult
be
quiet
fenn
said
forbes
girls
i
not
prepared
to
say
i
think
one
of
you
has
hidden
the
jewel
but
i
do
think
that
some
of
you
must
know
something
about
it
how
can
i
think
otherwise
now
tell
me
if
it
is
so
i
will
not
scold
i
will
not
even
blame
you
if
you
have
been
tempted
or
if
having
accidentally
carried
it
off
you
are
ashamed
to
own
up
i
not
a
harsh
man
i
only
want
the
truth
you
ca
be
surprised
at
my
conviction
that
you
do
know
something
of
it
why
here
the
case
in
a
nutshell
i
handed
that
earring
to
you
and
i
never
received
it
back
what
can
i
think
but
that
you
have
it
yet
it
is
valuable
to
be
sure
but
the
money
worth
of
it
is
as
nothing
to
the
awfulness
of
the
feeling
that
we
have
an
untrustworthy
person
among
us
can
it
be
either
of
my
two
nieces
who
has
done
this
wrong
can
it
be
either
of
their
two
young
friends
i
do
want
to
think
so
but
what
alternative
have
i
and
i
must
know
for
reasons
which
i
do
not
care
to
tell
you
it
is
imperative
that
i
shall
discover
who
is
at
fault
i
could
let
the
whole
matter
drop
but
there
is
a
very
strong
cause
why
i
should
not
do
so
i
beg
of
you
my
dear
nieces
my
dear
young
friends
i
beseech
you
tell
me
the
truth
wo
you
forbes
spoke
persuasively
and
kindly
alicia
burst
into
a
storm
of
tears
and
sobbed
wildly
bernice
her
face
hidden
in
her
handkerchief
was
crying
too
dotty
sat
stiffly
erect
in
her
chair
her
little
hands
clenched
her
big
black
eyes
staring
at
forbes
in
a
very
concentration
of
wrath
dolly
was
limp
and
exhausted
from
weeping
with
quivering
lips
and
in
a
shaking
voice
she
said
maybe
one
of
us
is
a
kleptomaniac
then
after
all
ah
a
confession
said
fenn
with
his
cynical
little
smile
go
on
miss
fayre
which
one
has
the
accumulating
tendency
you
do
make
me
so
mad
exclaimed
dotty
glaring
at
him
uncle
forbes
ca
we
talk
with
you
alone
oh
no
little
miss
said
fenn
forbes
is
far
too
to
look
after
this
affair
by
himself
he
swallow
all
the
stories
you
girls
would
tell
him
i
remain
if
you
please
unless
you
have
something
to
conceal
you
ca
object
to
my
presence
at
this
interesting
confab
dolly
came
to
dotty
aid
she
looked
at
the
secretary
with
a
glance
of
supreme
contempt
it
is
of
no
consequence
fenn
she
said
haughtily
whether
you
are
present
or
not
uncle
forbes
i
agree
with
dotty
you
said
yourself
you
have
an
acquaintance
who
ca
help
taking
treasures
that
are
not
his
own
it
may
be
that
one
of
us
has
done
this
but
even
so
the
jewel
must
be
in
the
house
none
of
us
has
been
out
of
the
house
since
we
were
in
this
room
yesterday
afternoon
so
if
it
is
in
the
house
it
must
be
found
ha
you
have
hidden
it
securely
to
be
willing
to
have
a
thorough
search
of
the
house
made
and
fenn
looked
unpleasantly
at
her
own
up
miss
fayre
it
will
save
a
lot
of
trouble
for
the
rest
of
us
dolly
tried
to
look
at
the
man
with
scorn
but
her
nerves
gave
way
and
again
she
broke
down
and
cried
softly
but
with
great
convulsive
sobs
dotty
was
furious
but
she
said
nothing
to
fenn
for
she
knew
she
would
only
get
the
worst
of
it
come
now
dolly
said
forbes
in
a
gentle
way
stop
crying
my
dear
and
let
talk
this
over
where
did
you
lay
the
earring
when
you
took
it
from
your
dress
on
on
the
stammered
dolly
trying
to
stop
crying
but
as
every
one
knows
it
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
stem
a
flood
of
tears
and
dolly
could
speak
clearly
yes
what
table
this
one
and
dotty
spoke
for
her
and
indicated
the
table
by
the
south
window
where
on
the
table
persisted
uncle
jeff
dolly
got
up
and
walked
over
to
the
light
stand
in
question
about
here
i
think
and
she
indicated
a
spot
on
the
surface
of
the
dull
finished
wood
why
did
you
hand
it
back
to
me
queried
forbes
in
a
kind
tone
i
know
sir
dolly
sobbed
again
i
sure
i
do
know
why
i
did
i
know
put
in
dotty
because
just
then
forbes
showed
us
a
bracelet
that
had
belonged
to
cleopatra
and
we
all
crowded
round
to
look
at
that
and
doll
laid
down
the
earring
to
take
up
the
bracelet
we
did
suppose
we
were
going
to
be
accused
of
stealing
tut
tut
said
forbes
nobody
has
used
that
word
i
do
accuse
you
of
anything
except
carelessness
but
when
it
comes
to
valuable
antiques
interrupted
fenn
it
is
what
is
called
criminal
carelessness
it
was
careless
of
dolly
to
lay
the
earring
down
said
forbes
but
that
is
not
the
real
point
after
she
laid
it
down
just
where
she
showed
us
on
that
small
table
somebody
must
have
picked
it
up
her
carelessness
in
laying
it
there
might
have
resulted
in
its
being
brushed
off
on
the
floor
but
not
in
its
utter
disappearance
maybe
it
fell
out
of
the
window
suggested
bernice
suddenly
that
window
was
open
then
you
know
forbes
waited
over
to
the
table
no
he
said
this
stand
is
fully
a
foot
from
the
window
sill
it
could
have
been
unknowingly
brushed
as
far
as
that
of
course
it
could
said
fenn
impatiently
you
making
no
progress
at
all
mr
forbes
propose
some
plan
yourself
then
said
dotty
shortly
you
so
smart
suppose
you
point
your
finger
to
the
thief
i
hope
to
do
so
miss
rose
and
fenn
smirked
in
a
most
aggravating
way
but
i
hesitate
to
accuse
anyone
before
i
am
quite
sure
a
wise
hesitation
retorted
dotty
stick
to
that
mr
fenn
she
turned
her
back
on
him
and
putting
her
arm
round
dolly
sat
in
silent
sympathy
suddenly
bernice
spoke
she
was
not
crying
now
on
the
contrary
she
was
composed
and
quiet
uncle
jeff
she
said
this
is
a
horrid
thing
that
has
happened
i
feel
awfully
sorry
about
it
all
but
especially
because
it
is
making
so
much
trouble
for
dolly
and
dotty
the
two
friends
that
i
brought
here
alicia
and
i
belong
here
in
a
way
but
the
others
are
our
guests
as
well
as
your
guests
it
is
up
to
us
to
free
them
from
all
suspicion
in
this
thing
and
that
can
only
be
done
by
finding
the
earring
i
believe
for
one
minute
that
any
one
of
us
four
girls
had
a
hand
knowingly
in
its
disappearance
but
if
one
of
us
did
she
must
be
shown
up
i
believe
in
fairness
all
round
and
while
i
sure
the
jewel
slipped
into
some
place
or
under
or
behind
something
yet
if
it
did
if
somebody
did
well
steal
it
we
must
find
out
who
i
would
be
willing
even
if
you
were
uncle
to
let
the
matter
drop
i
want
to
know
the
solution
of
the
mystery
and
i
going
to
find
it
bravo
bernie
girl
cried
her
uncle
that
the
talk
as
i
told
you
i
must
know
the
truth
of
this
thing
never
mind
why
i
must
find
it
out
but
how
first
said
bernice
speaking
very
decidedly
but
not
looking
toward
the
other
girls
i
think
all
our
things
ought
to
be
searched
oh
pshaw
bernie
said
alicia
that
would
be
silly
you
know
if
any
of
us
wanted
to
hide
that
earring
we
would
put
it
in
among
our
clothes
why
not
demanded
bernice
i
ca
imagine
any
of
us
having
it
but
if
we
have
it
by
accident
why
it
might
have
caught
in
any
of
our
dresses
or
sashes
and
be
tucked
away
there
yet
that
so
and
dotty
looked
hopeful
it
could
be
that
as
one
of
us
passed
by
the
table
it
got
caught
in
our
clothing
anyway
we
all
look
but
do
look
in
your
own
boxes
objected
fenn
every
girl
must
search
another
belongings
i
wonder
you
trust
us
to
do
that
snapped
dotty
and
fenn
immediately
replied
you
right
it
would
be
safe
i
propose
that
berry
search
all
your
rooms
look
here
fenn
you
are
unduly
suspicious
forbes
remonstrated
mildly
but
sir
do
you
want
to
get
back
your
gem
or
not
you
asked
for
my
advice
and
help
in
this
matter
now
i
must
beg
to
be
allowed
to
carry
out
my
plans
of
procedure
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
forbes
was
under
the
thumb
of
his
secretary
and
this
was
true
lewis
fenn
had
held
his
position
for
a
long
time
and
his
services
were
invaluable
to
jefferson
forbes
it
was
necessary
that
the
collector
should
have
a
reliable
responsible
and
capable
man
to
attend
to
the
duties
he
required
of
a
secretary
and
these
attributes
fenn
fully
possessed
but
he
was
of
a
small
suspicious
nature
and
having
decided
on
what
course
to
pursue
regarding
the
lost
curio
he
was
not
to
be
swerved
from
his
path
well
well
we
will
see
forbes
said
an
anxious
look
wrinkling
his
forehead
as
he
looked
at
the
girls
run
away
now
it
nearly
luncheon
time
do
worry
over
the
thing
each
one
of
you
knows
her
own
heart
if
you
are
innocent
you
no
call
to
worry
if
you
are
implicated
even
in
a
small
degree
in
the
loss
of
my
property
come
to
me
and
tell
me
so
see
me
alone
if
you
like
i
will
hear
your
confession
and
if
it
seems
wise
i
will
keep
it
confidential
i
promise
this
for
as
i
hinted
i
have
a
very
strong
reason
for
probing
this
affair
to
the
very
core
it
is
a
mystery
that
must
be
cleared
up
chapter
xiv
at
the
tea
room
the
girls
went
to
their
rooms
to
tidy
up
for
luncheon
though
there
was
some
time
before
the
meal
would
be
announced
by
common
consent
the
door
was
closed
between
the
rooms
and
on
one
side
of
it
the
two
d
faced
each
other
did
you
ever
see
such
a
perfectly
horrid
hateful
contemptible
old
thing
as
that
fenn
person
exclaimed
dotty
her
voice
fairly
shaken
with
wrath
i
ca
see
how
forbes
can
bear
to
have
him
around
he
ought
to
be
excommunicated
or
whatever
they
do
to
terrible
people
he
is
awful
dotty
i
do
wonder
you
gave
it
to
him
but
you
do
it
he
forbes
right
hand
man
and
whatever
uncle
jeff
tells
him
to
do
he
do
it
the
idea
of
searching
our
trunks
i
wo
allow
them
to
touch
mine
i
can
tell
you
that
oh
dolly
now
do
be
stubborn
why
for
you
to
refuse
to
let
them
look
over
your
things
would
be
the
same
as
saying
you
had
the
thing
hidden
dorothy
rose
what
a
thing
to
say
to
me
i
not
saying
it
to
you
i
mean
i
am
saying
it
to
you
just
to
show
you
what
other
people
would
say
you
know
it
dolly
you
know
fenn
would
say
you
had
the
earring
but
dotty
it
must
be
somewhere
of
course
it
must
be
somewhere
look
here
dollyrinda
you
know
anything
about
it
do
you
honest
injun
how
you
talk
dot
how
should
i
know
anything
about
it
but
do
you
do
be
silly
but
do
you
dotty
i
get
mad
at
you
if
you
just
sit
there
saying
do
you
like
a
talking
machine
are
you
going
to
change
your
dress
for
luncheon
no
i
not
these
frocks
are
good
enough
but
dolly
do
you
do
you
know
anything
anything
at
all
about
the
earring
dolly
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
her
little
white
bed
at
reiteration
of
her
query
dolly
threw
her
head
down
on
the
pillow
and
hid
her
face
do
you
repeated
dotty
her
voice
now
tinged
with
fear
dolly
sat
upright
and
looked
at
her
do
ask
me
dotty
she
said
i
ca
tell
you
ca
tell
me
cried
dotty
in
bewilderment
then
who
on
earth
could
you
tell
i
like
to
know
i
could
tell
mother
oh
dotty
i
want
to
go
home
well
you
ca
go
home
not
till
day
after
anyway
the
matter
with
you
dolly
why
ca
you
tell
me
what
you
know
how
can
i
find
the
thing
and
clear
you
from
suspicion
if
you
have
secrets
from
me
you
ca
dotty
do
try
dolly
spoke
in
a
tense
strained
way
as
if
trying
to
preserve
her
calm
she
sat
down
at
their
little
and
began
to
brush
her
hair
a
tap
came
at
the
door
and
in
a
moment
bernice
came
in
let
me
come
in
and
talk
to
you
girls
she
begged
alicia
is
in
a
temper
and
wo
say
anything
except
to
snap
out
something
quarrelsome
what
are
we
going
to
do
i
do
know
bernie
and
dotty
looked
as
if
at
her
wits
end
bad
enough
to
put
up
with
that
old
fenn
hateful
talk
but
now
gone
queer
and
you
say
alicia
has
what
are
we
to
do
let
talk
it
all
over
with
berry
at
lunch
she
real
sensible
and
she
very
yes
she
is
and
there
the
gong
now
come
on
let
go
down
come
on
dollikins
brace
up
and
look
pretty
heigho
come
on
alicia
alicia
appeared
looking
sullen
rather
than
sad
and
the
quartette
went
downstairs
berry
listened
with
interest
to
their
story
interest
that
quickly
turned
to
deep
concern
as
the
story
went
on
i
do
like
it
she
said
as
the
girls
paused
to
hear
her
comments
no
carelessness
or
thoughtlessness
could
make
that
valuable
earring
disappear
off
the
face
of
the
earth
i
mean
it
could
get
lost
it
must
have
been
taken
by
us
flared
out
alicia
maybe
not
meaningly
maybe
for
a
joke
maybe
unconsciously
but
it
was
carried
out
of
that
room
by
some
one
of
that
i
certain
the
idea
of
thinking
we
do
it
as
a
joke
cried
bernice
but
you
told
me
about
the
joke
forbes
played
on
you
about
the
image
why
might
one
of
you
have
taken
this
to
tease
him
oh
girls
if
any
of
you
did
give
it
back
i
beg
of
you
forbes
is
a
kind
man
but
a
very
just
one
if
you
give
it
back
at
once
and
explain
he
will
forgive
you
fully
and
freely
but
if
you
delay
too
long
he
will
lose
patience
and
too
you
must
know
he
wants
to
wants
to
what
mrs
berry
asked
dotty
for
the
lady
had
stopped
speaking
very
suddenly
never
mind
i
forgot
myself
but
forbes
has
a
very
strong
reason
for
wishing
to
sift
this
matter
to
the
bottom
do
girls
oh
deceive
him
what
makes
you
think
we
deceiving
him
cried
dotty
that
the
way
old
fenn
talks
is
he
a
disagreeable
man
mrs
berry
fenn
is
peculiar
she
admitted
but
it
is
nice
for
you
to
criticise
forbes
secretary
he
is
a
trusted
employee
and
of
great
use
in
his
various
capacities
but
he
was
very
rude
to
us
complained
alicia
he
was
positively
insulting
to
dolly
and
me
do
remember
it
counselled
berry
the
least
you
have
to
do
with
him
the
better
forget
anything
he
may
have
said
and
keep
out
of
his
way
all
you
can
forbes
housekeeper
was
a
tactful
and
peaceable
woman
and
she
well
knew
the
temperament
and
disposition
of
the
secretary
she
herself
disliked
him
exceedingly
but
it
was
part
of
her
diplomacy
to
avoid
open
encounter
with
him
and
she
deemed
it
best
for
the
girls
to
follow
her
course
i
think
she
said
finally
the
best
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
go
for
a
nice
motor
ride
in
the
park
it
is
a
lovely
day
and
the
ride
will
do
you
good
and
make
you
feel
a
heap
better
then
on
your
return
stop
at
a
pretty
tearoom
and
have
some
cakes
and
chocolate
or
ices
and
while
you
gone
i
have
a
little
talk
with
forbes
and
who
knows
maybe
we
might
find
the
earring
you
going
to
search
our
boxes
cried
alicia
well
i
wo
submit
to
such
an
insult
i
shall
lock
mine
before
i
go
out
so
shall
i
declared
dolly
i
think
we
all
ought
to
really
berry
it
awful
for
you
to
do
a
thing
like
that
mercy
me
girls
how
you
do
jump
at
conclusions
i
never
said
a
word
about
searching
your
rooms
i
had
no
thought
of
such
a
thing
you
must
condemn
me
unheard
you
would
like
that
yourselves
indeed
we
would
berry
cried
dolly
smiling
at
her
i
apologise
for
my
burst
of
temper
i
sure
but
i
hate
to
be
suspected
be
careful
dolly
not
to
be
selfish
others
hate
to
be
suspected
too
yes
but
innocent
cried
dolly
and
as
soon
as
she
had
spoken
she
blushed
fiery
red
and
her
sweet
face
was
covered
with
confusion
meaning
somebody
else
is
innocent
spoke
up
alicia
who
please
me
probably
said
dotty
striving
to
turn
the
matter
off
with
a
laugh
dolly
and
i
always
suspect
each
other
on
principle
oh
pooh
this
is
no
time
to
be
funny
and
alicia
looked
daggers
at
the
smiling
dotty
you
right
alicia
it
is
she
flashed
back
and
then
berry
calm
voice
interrupted
again
now
girlies
do
quarrel
among
yourselves
there
trouble
enough
afoot
without
your
adding
to
it
take
my
advice
go
and
put
on
some
pretty
dresses
and
then
go
for
a
ride
as
i
told
you
and
get
your
tea
at
the
titania
tearoom
it
just
lately
been
opened
and
a
most
attractive
place
but
promise
not
to
squabble
indeed
i
wish
you
promise
not
to
discuss
this
matter
of
the
earring
but
i
suppose
that
too
much
to
ask
yes
indeed
berry
and
bernice
smiled
at
her
i
sure
we
could
keep
that
promise
if
we
made
it
well
do
quarrel
it
ca
do
any
good
run
along
now
and
dress
the
cheery
of
the
housekeeper
helped
to
raise
the
depressed
spirits
and
after
they
had
changed
into
pretty
afternoon
costumes
and
donned
their
coats
and
furs
they
had
at
least
partially
forgotten
their
troubles
of
the
morning
but
not
for
long
as
they
sped
along
in
the
great
comfortable
car
each
found
her
thoughts
reverting
to
the
sad
episode
and
oh
with
what
varied
feelings
suddenly
bernice
broke
out
with
a
new
theory
i
tell
you
what
she
exclaimed
uncle
jeff
hid
that
thing
himself
to
see
how
we
would
act
then
he
pretended
to
suspect
us
that
man
is
studying
us
oh
you
need
tell
me
i
noticed
it
ever
since
we
came
he
watches
everything
we
do
and
when
he
says
anything
especial
he
looks
closely
to
see
how
we
going
to
take
it
i
noticed
that
too
agreed
dolly
but
it
silly
bernie
to
think
he
took
his
own
jewel
just
to
test
us
you
know
i
ca
make
out
why
he
wants
to
study
us
so
but
maybe
he
writing
a
book
or
something
like
that
else
why
did
he
want
not
only
alicia
and
me
but
two
of
our
friends
to
come
for
this
visit
he
studies
us
not
only
as
to
our
own
characters
but
the
effect
we
have
on
each
other
dotty
looked
at
bernice
with
interest
you
clever
thing
she
cried
i
do
believe
you
right
i
caught
uncle
forbes
frequently
looking
at
one
or
another
of
us
with
the
most
quizzical
expression
and
listening
intently
for
our
answers
to
some
question
of
right
or
wrong
or
our
opinions
about
something
i
noticed
it
said
dolly
though
in
an
indifferent
tone
but
i
do
think
he
studying
us
i
think
he
so
unused
to
young
people
that
everything
we
do
seems
strange
to
him
why
any
of
our
fathers
would
know
what
we
going
to
say
before
we
say
it
mine
would
anyhow
and
so
would
dot
but
forbes
is
surprised
at
anything
we
say
or
do
because
he
never
saw
girls
at
close
range
before
i
think
we
interest
him
just
like
his
specimens
do
that
it
cried
dotty
you
struck
it
doll
we
just
specimens
to
him
he
studying
a
new
kind
of
creature
and
maybe
he
did
want
to
see
what
we
do
in
given
circumstances
like
an
unjust
accusation
and
so
he
arranged
this
tragic
situation
no
said
dolly
still
in
that
unnerved
listless
way
no
that
do
dotty
if
it
were
true
he
never
let
fenn
be
so
rude
to
us
why
this
morning
i
sure
i
know
forbes
was
just
as
uncertain
of
what
had
become
of
that
earring
as
as
any
of
us
were
well
have
it
your
own
way
and
dotty
smiled
at
her
chum
but
here
my
decision
that
thing
is
lost
somehow
or
other
for
some
ridiculous
reason
blame
seems
to
be
attached
to
my
dollyrinda
i
wo
stand
it
i
hereby
announce
that
i
going
to
find
that
missing
gimcrack
before
i
go
back
to
my
native
heath
if
i
have
to
take
all
summer
are
you
going
home
on
wednesday
cried
dolly
looking
aghast
at
the
idea
not
unless
that
old
thing
is
found
i
telephone
my
dear
parents
not
to
look
for
me
until
they
see
me
i
hunt
every
nook
and
cranny
of
forbes
house
and
when
i
get
through
i
hunt
over
again
but
find
the
thing
i
will
so
there
now
why
do
you
say
dolly
is
suspected
asked
alicia
oh
you
all
know
she
is
just
because
she
hooked
the
foolish
thing
into
her
lace
she
put
it
on
the
table
after
that
and
every
one
of
us
probably
handled
it
but
no
it
is
laid
to
dolly
just
because
the
only
one
of
us
incapable
of
such
a
thing
i
guess
why
dot
rose
what
a
speech
and
dolly
almost
laughed
at
the
belligerent
dotty
none
of
us
would
take
it
wrongly
i
sure
but
well
but
what
demanded
alicia
as
dolly
paused
oh
nothing
alicia
but
the
same
old
arguments
mistake
unintentional
caught
in
our
dresses
and
all
that
dolly
spoke
wearily
as
if
worn
out
with
the
subject
well
i
a
new
theory
said
dotty
i
believe
that
fenn
man
stole
it
the
other
three
laughed
but
dotty
went
on
yes
i
do
you
see
never
had
a
chance
to
take
any
of
the
treasures
before
uncle
forbes
would
know
he
was
the
thief
but
now
he
has
all
us
four
to
lay
it
on
so
he
made
the
most
of
his
chance
oh
dotty
i
ca
believe
it
said
bernice
he
did
act
like
a
thief
this
morning
he
was
more
like
an
avenging
justice
that
just
his
smartness
make
it
seem
as
if
we
did
it
you
know
nothing
in
it
and
dolly
smiled
at
dotty
theory
he
was
here
yesterday
at
all
he
did
know
that
i
hooked
the
old
thing
on
my
waist
oh
i
wish
i
had
done
that
never
you
mind
dollums
dotty
said
endearingly
if
he
did
do
it
we
track
him
down
because
girls
i
tell
you
i
going
to
find
that
earring
and
what
dorothy
rose
says
goes
see
dotty
brightness
cheered
up
the
others
and
as
they
drove
through
the
park
there
were
many
sights
of
interest
and
after
a
time
the
talk
drifted
from
the
subject
that
had
so
engrossed
them
and
when
at
last
they
stopped
at
the
new
tea
room
and
went
in
the
beauty
and
gaiety
of
the
place
made
them
almost
forget
their
trouble
i
have
cafe
parfait
said
dotty
with
heaps
of
little
fancy
cakes
we
ca
get
real
fancy
cakes
in
berwick
and
i
do
love
the
others
were
of
a
like
mind
and
soon
they
were
feasting
on
the
rich
and
delicate
confections
that
the
modern
tea
room
delights
to
provide
while
they
sat
there
muriel
brown
came
in
accompanied
by
two
of
her
girl
friends
oh
may
we
chum
with
you
muriel
cried
and
our
four
girls
said
yes
delightedly
how
strange
we
should
meet
said
dolly
but
muriel
laughed
and
responded
not
so
very
as
i
here
about
four
or
five
days
out
of
the
seven
i
just
simply
love
the
waffles
here
do
you
and
then
the
girls
all
laughed
and
chattered
and
the
new
yorkers
invited
the
other
four
to
several
parties
and
small
affairs
new
york
is
the
most
hospitable
place
i
ever
saw
declared
dotty
we
seem
to
be
asked
somewhere
every
day
for
a
week
everybody
that
laughed
muriel
but
you
must
come
to
these
things
we
asking
you
for
wo
you
i
do
believe
we
can
promise
said
bernice
suddenly
growing
serious
you
see
we
may
go
home
on
wednesday
day
after
oh
impossible
do
say
the
word
and
with
a
laugh
muriel
dashed
away
the
unwelcome
thought
i
shall
depend
upon
you
she
went
on
especially
for
the
friday
party
that
one
of
the
best
of
all
you
just
must
be
at
it
if
we
here
we
will
declared
alicia
carried
away
by
the
gay
insistence
and
i
sure
bernice
and
i
will
be
here
even
if
the
others
are
i
want
you
all
laughed
muriel
but
i
take
as
many
as
i
can
get
then
into
the
limousine
again
and
off
for
home
oh
cried
dolly
that
horrid
business
i
had
almost
forgotten
it
we
ca
forget
it
till
it
settled
said
dotty
and
her
lips
came
tightly
together
with
a
grim
expression
that
she
showed
only
when
desperately
in
earnest
chapter
xv
dolly
ride
it
was
tuesday
morning
that
lewis
fenn
came
to
dolly
and
asked
her
to
give
him
a
few
moments
chat
a
little
bewildered
dolly
followed
fenn
into
the
reception
room
and
they
sat
down
fenn
closing
the
door
after
them
it
this
way
miss
fayre
he
began
i
know
you
took
the
gold
earring
it
useless
for
you
to
deny
it
it
speaks
for
itself
you
are
the
only
one
of
you
girls
especially
interested
in
antiques
and
moreover
you
are
the
one
who
handled
the
jewel
last
now
i
do
for
a
moment
hold
you
guilty
of
stealing
i
know
that
you
thought
the
thing
of
no
very
great
intrinsic
value
and
as
forbes
has
so
many
such
things
in
his
possession
you
thought
one
more
or
less
could
matter
to
him
so
overcome
by
your
desire
to
keep
it
as
a
souvenir
and
because
of
its
antique
interest
you
involuntarily
took
it
away
with
you
of
course
searching
your
boxes
is
useless
for
you
have
concealed
it
some
place
in
the
house
where
no
one
would
think
of
looking
now
i
come
to
you
as
a
friend
and
advise
you
to
own
up
i
assure
you
forbes
will
forgive
you
and
he
will
do
so
much
more
readily
if
you
go
to
him
at
once
and
confess
dolly
sat
rigidly
through
this
long
citation
her
face
growing
whiter
her
eyes
more
and
more
frightened
as
she
listened
when
fenn
paused
she
struggled
to
speak
but
could
utter
a
sound
she
was
speechless
with
mingled
emotions
she
was
angry
primarily
but
other
thoughts
rushed
through
her
brain
and
she
hesitated
what
attitude
to
assume
the
secretary
looked
at
her
curiously
well
he
said
and
there
was
a
threatening
tone
in
his
voice
dolly
looked
at
him
looked
straight
into
his
accusing
eyes
began
to
speak
and
then
in
a
burst
of
tears
she
cried
out
oh
how
i
hate
you
dotty
flung
open
the
door
and
walked
in
i
been
listening
she
announced
listening
at
the
keyhole
to
hear
what
you
said
to
my
friend
i
heard
and
i
will
answer
you
dolly
fayre
no
more
took
that
earring
than
you
did
fenn
and
inclined
to
think
from
your
manner
that
you
stole
it
yourself
what
shouted
fenn
surprised
out
of
his
usual
calm
what
do
you
mean
you
little
minx
just
what
i
say
repeated
dotty
but
dolly
had
already
fled
from
the
room
she
went
in
search
of
berry
and
found
her
in
her
own
bedroom
please
berry
said
dolly
controlling
her
voice
i
want
to
go
out
all
by
myself
a
little
while
may
i
goodness
child
what
do
you
mean
where
i
go
with
you
no
i
want
to
go
alone
i
have
to
think
something
out
all
by
myself
nobody
can
help
me
and
if
i
here
all
the
girls
will
butt
in
and
bother
me
where
are
you
going
for
a
walk
no
please
i
want
to
ride
on
the
top
of
a
fifth
avenue
stage
i
want
to
go
alone
and
then
sitting
up
there
with
the
fresh
air
blowing
around
me
i
can
think
something
out
i
may
go
may
i
berry
i
know
all
about
the
stages
why
yes
child
of
course
you
can
go
if
you
really
want
to
you
ca
come
to
any
harm
just
riding
on
top
of
a
bus
run
along
but
rather
you
let
me
help
you
or
go
with
you
no
please
i
must
be
alone
i
do
want
even
dotty
i
have
something
very
serious
to
decide
no
one
can
help
me
my
mother
could
but
she
is
here
i
wish
you
try
me
and
the
kind
lady
smiled
endearingly
i
would
if
i
could
and
you
a
dear
to
ask
me
but
this
is
a
special
matter
and
it
troubles
me
awfully
so
i
go
off
by
myself
for
an
hour
or
so
and
when
i
come
back
i
be
all
decided
about
it
dolly
got
her
hat
and
coat
without
seeing
the
other
girls
at
all
she
went
out
at
the
front
door
of
the
big
fifth
avenue
house
and
walked
a
few
blocks
before
she
stopped
to
wait
for
a
stage
i
do
care
which
way
i
go
she
thought
to
herself
i
take
the
first
bus
that
comes
along
the
first
one
chanced
to
be
going
and
signalling
the
conductor
dolly
climbed
the
little
winding
stairs
to
the
top
there
were
only
half
a
dozen
passengers
up
there
and
dolly
sat
down
near
the
front
it
was
a
clear
crisp
morning
the
air
was
full
of
ozone
and
no
sooner
had
dolly
settled
herself
into
her
seat
than
she
began
to
feel
better
her
mind
cleared
and
she
could
combat
the
problems
that
were
troubling
her
but
she
was
in
a
dilemma
should
she
go
to
forbes
and
tell
him
where
the
jewel
was
or
should
she
not
she
wanted
to
be
honest
she
wanted
to
do
right
but
it
would
be
a
hard
task
the
more
she
thought
it
over
the
more
she
was
perplexed
and
though
her
spirits
were
cheered
by
the
pleasant
ride
her
troubles
were
as
far
as
ever
from
a
solution
down
she
went
down
the
beautiful
avenue
past
the
sherman
statue
and
the
plaza
fountain
on
past
the
library
down
through
the
shopping
district
and
then
dolly
concluded
she
would
go
on
down
to
the
washington
arch
and
stay
in
the
same
bus
for
the
return
trip
but
before
she
realised
it
she
found
the
bus
she
was
in
had
turned
east
on
street
and
was
headed
for
the
railroad
station
she
started
up
to
get
off
the
stage
but
sat
down
again
what
the
use
she
thought
i
can
just
as
well
go
on
to
the
station
and
come
back
again
i
only
want
the
ride
so
she
went
on
and
at
the
station
she
was
asked
to
take
another
stage
down
the
stairs
she
climbed
and
as
she
glanced
at
the
great
colonnade
of
the
building
she
realised
that
from
there
trains
went
home
home
where
mother
was
unable
to
resist
dolly
obeyed
an
impulse
to
enter
the
station
the
warm
pleasant
atmosphere
of
the
arcade
soothed
her
nerves
and
she
walked
along
thinking
deeply
she
came
to
the
stairs
that
led
down
to
the
waiting
rooms
and
a
great
wave
of
homesickness
came
over
her
she
would
go
home
she
had
money
with
her
she
would
buy
a
ticket
and
go
straight
to
berwick
she
could
she
simply
could
not
face
uncle
jeff
and
the
girls
with
her
secret
untold
and
she
would
not
tell
it
anyway
she
could
go
back
to
the
house
where
that
horrid
fenn
was
that
was
certain
she
looked
in
her
and
tucked
away
in
its
folds
was
the
return
half
of
her
berwick
ticket
she
had
forgotten
that
she
had
it
with
her
it
seemed
a
finger
of
fate
pointing
the
way
i
will
she
decided
i
will
go
back
to
berwick
i
ask
about
the
trains
inquiry
at
the
information
department
told
her
that
there
would
be
a
train
for
berwick
in
half
an
hour
and
dolly
went
in
and
sat
down
in
the
waiting
room
suddenly
it
struck
her
that
the
people
at
forbes
would
be
alarmed
at
her
and
would
be
very
anxious
for
her
safety
that
would
never
do
she
had
no
wish
to
disturb
kind
berry
or
to
scare
dotty
half
to
death
she
saw
the
telephone
booths
near
by
and
realised
how
easy
it
would
be
to
communicate
with
the
house
she
asked
the
operator
for
the
number
of
jefferson
forbes
residence
and
in
a
moment
was
in
the
booth
the
butler
responded
to
her
call
and
dolly
did
not
ask
for
any
one
else
that
you
mcpherson
she
said
speaking
as
casually
as
she
could
yes
miss
fayre
will
you
speak
with
mrs
berry
no
i
give
you
a
message
please
say
to
miss
rose
that
i
have
gone
to
berwick
to
berwick
miss
yes
and
tell
berry
the
same
that
all
mcpherson
no
message
for
any
one
else
yes
miss
fayre
when
will
you
be
back
miss
fayre
not
at
all
or
that
is
never
mind
that
just
say
i
have
gone
to
berwick
i
write
to
miss
rose
as
soon
as
i
get
there
yes
miss
fayre
and
the
butler
hung
up
his
receiver
it
was
not
his
business
if
the
ladies
came
or
went
in
obedience
to
orders
mcpherson
went
to
berry
and
delivered
the
message
the
dear
child
said
the
housekeeper
and
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes
of
course
she
knew
about
the
earring
episode
and
until
now
she
suspected
that
dolly
really
took
it
but
to
run
away
practically
proved
her
guilt
so
she
had
meant
to
go
when
she
asked
permission
to
go
on
the
bus
berry
heart
was
torn
for
she
loved
dolly
best
of
the
four
and
it
was
a
blow
to
be
thus
forced
to
believe
her
guilty
she
quizzed
the
butler
but
he
had
no
further
information
to
give
she
only
said
she
was
going
and
said
for
me
to
tell
you
and
miss
rose
that
all
i
will
tell
miss
rose
said
berry
and
dismissed
the
man
she
thought
deeply
before
going
to
find
dotty
she
wondered
if
she
might
yet
stay
dolly
flight
and
persuade
her
to
return
she
looked
up
a
timetable
and
found
that
the
train
for
berwick
would
leave
in
ten
minutes
doubtless
dolly
was
already
in
the
car
however
being
a
woman
of
energetic
nature
berry
telephoned
to
the
railroad
station
she
asked
for
a
porter
and
begged
him
to
try
to
find
dolly
whom
she
described
and
ask
her
to
come
to
the
telephone
i
remember
seeing
that
girl
said
the
negro
porter
she
was
walking
around
sort
of
and
sort
of
uncertain
but
i
do
see
her
now
look
on
the
berwick
train
commanded
berry
and
do
it
quickly
if
she
on
the
train
ask
her
to
get
off
and
answer
my
call
i
think
she
do
it
go
quickly
i
hold
the
wire
but
it
was
within
a
few
minutes
of
starting
time
the
train
was
crowded
and
after
a
short
search
the
porter
came
back
with
the
word
that
he
could
find
her
i
could
of
he
said
if
i
had
a
minute
more
but
the
train
despatcher
put
me
off
and
they
started
sorry
i
sorry
too
and
berry
sighed
as
she
realised
how
near
she
had
come
to
success
only
to
fail
she
thought
a
few
moments
longer
then
she
went
to
find
dotty
that
young
person
she
discovered
to
her
astonishment
was
up
in
forbes
own
study
on
the
fourth
floor
dotty
had
insisted
on
an
interview
with
her
host
after
the
stormy
time
she
had
with
his
secretary
forbes
had
received
her
not
at
all
unwillingly
for
he
wanted
to
get
at
the
truth
of
the
unpleasant
matter
dolly
never
took
it
berry
heard
dotty
declare
as
she
approached
the
door
either
it
just
lost
or
else
fenn
stole
it
or
else
or
else
what
asked
forbes
as
dotty
paused
i
do
like
to
say
and
dotty
twisted
her
finger
nervously
i
do
suspect
somebody
at
least
i
fear
maybe
i
do
a
little
bit
but
i
wo
say
anything
about
it
unless
you
keep
on
blaming
dolly
then
i
will
i
have
something
to
tell
you
said
berry
entering
dolly
has
gone
home
what
cried
forbes
and
dotty
simultaneously
lewis
fenn
smiled
yes
continued
berry
she
has
gone
home
to
berwick
she
came
to
me
and
asked
if
she
might
go
for
a
ride
on
top
of
a
fifth
avenue
stage
to
think
things
out
by
herself
she
said
then
a
little
later
she
telephoned
from
the
pennsylvania
station
that
she
was
just
taking
the
train
for
berwick
i
do
believe
it
cried
dotty
who
told
you
mcpherson
he
took
the
message
dolly
said
to
tell
you
dotty
and
to
tell
me
but
she
sent
no
word
to
any
one
else
looks
bad
said
forbes
shaking
his
head
i
told
you
so
said
lewis
fenn
nodding
his
i
knew
when
i
flatly
accused
miss
fayre
this
morning
of
taking
the
earring
that
she
was
the
guilty
one
understand
me
she
did
mean
to
steal
she
did
look
upon
it
as
theft
she
only
took
a
fancy
to
the
bauble
and
appropriated
it
without
really
thinking
it
wrong
as
a
child
would
take
a
worthless
little
trinket
you
know
dotty
looked
stunned
she
paid
no
attention
to
fenn
talk
she
stared
at
berry
saying
has
she
really
gone
yes
dear
answered
the
sympathetic
lady
she
has
perhaps
it
the
best
thing
she
tell
her
mother
all
about
it
and
then
we
know
the
truth
yes
she
confess
to
her
mother
said
fenn
and
he
grinned
in
satisfaction
shut
up
fenn
said
forbes
i
not
at
all
sure
dolly
is
the
culprit
if
i
know
that
girl
she
would
run
away
if
she
were
guilty
but
she
might
if
she
were
unjustly
accused
that
generous
of
you
sir
said
the
secretary
but
you
know
yourself
that
when
i
taxed
miss
fayre
definitely
with
the
deed
she
immediately
went
off
pretending
that
she
was
just
going
for
a
ride
and
would
return
that
piece
of
deception
does
look
like
innocence
i
think
you
must
admit
no
no
it
does
dotty
did
you
say
you
had
some
other
suspicion
what
is
it
i
ca
tell
it
now
i
ca
understand
dolly
i
know
oh
i
know
she
never
took
the
earring
but
i
ca
understand
her
going
off
like
that
she
never
pretends
she
never
deceitful
she
surely
was
this
time
and
fenn
seemed
to
exult
in
the
fact
maybe
she
changed
her
plan
after
she
started
suggested
dotty
delorously
not
likely
mused
forbes
it
was
unprecedented
for
her
to
go
alone
for
a
bus
ride
but
if
it
was
because
she
wanted
to
get
off
home
secretly
it
is
of
course
very
plausible
she
did
want
any
of
you
girls
to
know
she
was
going
lest
you
persuade
her
not
to
she
want
to
go
in
my
car
alone
as
that
would
seem
strange
but
to
take
a
bus
that
was
really
a
clever
way
to
escape
unnoticed
i
surprised
that
she
telephoned
back
at
all
said
fenn
of
course
she
would
said
dotty
indignantly
she
did
want
us
to
think
she
was
lost
or
worry
about
her
safety
she
was
most
considerate
said
fenn
sarcastically
oh
stop
cried
dotty
at
the
very
end
of
her
patience
with
the
man
you
enough
to
drive
any
one
distracted
let
the
child
alone
fenn
said
forbes
your
manner
is
irritating
the
whole
affair
is
irritating
returned
the
secretary
but
it
is
now
in
a
way
to
be
cleared
up
i
think
we
shall
hear
from
miss
parents
i
sure
what
is
going
on
spoke
up
alicia
from
the
doorway
and
she
and
bernice
came
into
the
room
i
know
we
forbidden
up
here
but
dotty
here
so
we
came
too
what
the
matter
dolly
gone
home
said
forbes
looking
at
his
nieces
dolly
has
exclaimed
bernice
what
for
because
she
was
persecuted
dotty
replied
and
unjustly
accused
and
suspected
and
her
life
made
generally
miserable
i
do
blame
her
for
going
home
i
going
too
when
did
she
go
who
took
her
alicia
asked
she
went
alone
said
berry
and
she
gave
them
the
details
of
dolly
departure
well
i
am
surprised
said
bernice
but
alicia
began
to
cry
softly
yes
cry
alicia
said
dotty
turning
on
her
i
should
think
you
would
you
made
dolly
go
you
know
where
that
earring
thing
is
i
do
not
and
alicia
stared
at
dotty
well
you
know
something
more
than
you
told
chapter
xvi
was
it
alicia
what
do
you
mean
by
that
speech
dotty
asked
bernice
as
alicia
kept
on
crying
i
mean
just
what
i
say
alicia
knows
where
the
earring
is
or
if
she
does
know
that
she
knows
something
about
it
that
she
wo
tell
us
what
is
it
alicia
said
her
uncle
kindly
if
you
know
anything
at
all
tell
us
wo
you
i
do
uncle
i
do
know
anything
about
it
and
alicia
wept
more
than
ever
well
the
thing
to
do
is
to
find
it
said
fenn
gazing
closely
at
alicia
where
we
find
it
will
disclose
who
took
it
i
agree
with
you
fenn
said
a
voice
from
the
doorway
and
there
stood
dolly
fayre
oh
cried
dotty
i
knew
you
would
run
away
i
did
returned
dolly
looking
very
sober
i
could
stand
things
here
and
i
was
tempted
to
go
home
did
you
start
out
with
that
idea
asked
dotty
no
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
when
i
went
out
but
i
took
a
bus
that
turned
around
and
went
to
the
station
so
that
made
me
think
of
berwick
and
i
got
homesick
for
mother
and
i
just
could
help
wanting
to
go
to
her
and
i
telephoned
back
here
that
i
was
going
then
i
had
no
sooner
done
that
than
it
seemed
to
me
a
cowardly
thing
to
do
after
all
and
i
changed
my
mind
quick
and
came
right
back
here
i
rode
up
on
top
of
a
stage
and
the
trip
in
this
lovely
bright
air
made
me
feel
a
heap
better
now
then
i
want
to
say
once
for
all
that
i
did
take
that
earring
but
i
going
to
find
out
who
did
and
also
i
going
to
find
the
jewel
i
do
know
which
i
find
first
but
one
means
the
other
just
what
i
said
miss
fayre
exclaimed
fenn
i
join
forces
with
you
and
we
see
about
this
thing
we
find
the
missing
jewel
and
we
find
out
who
took
it
but
we
have
to
put
up
a
search
all
my
things
are
at
your
disposal
said
dolly
look
through
all
my
cupboards
and
bureau
drawers
as
you
like
i
not
afraid
of
course
not
said
fenn
after
your
absence
this
morning
you
had
a
fine
opportunity
to
dispose
of
the
jewel
how
dare
you
cried
dolly
turning
white
with
rage
i
have
told
you
truthfully
where
i
went
and
why
let
her
alone
fenn
said
forbes
sharply
you
talk
too
much
run
along
now
girls
we
let
the
matter
rest
for
consult
with
fenn
and
i
do
think
we
search
your
belongings
i
ca
think
any
one
of
you
has
intentionally
concealed
the
jewel
it
lost
but
not
stolen
that
what
i
think
you
dear
old
thing
and
bernice
impulsively
threw
her
arms
around
her
uncle
neck
i
think
you
right
but
it
must
be
found
it
must
be
found
repeated
dolly
otherwise
suspicion
will
always
rest
on
me
not
on
you
any
more
than
the
rest
of
us
declared
dotty
but
no
use
in
hunting
any
more
in
this
room
it
simply
is
here
they
had
searched
the
room
in
which
the
jewel
had
been
kept
thoroughly
and
repeatedly
so
the
girls
went
off
to
their
own
rooms
to
talk
it
all
over
again
you
too
hard
on
them
fenn
said
forbes
to
his
secretary
when
they
were
alone
but
it
a
clear
case
sir
that
fayre
girl
took
it
she
got
scared
and
tried
to
run
home
then
decided
it
would
be
better
to
face
the
music
so
she
returned
she
the
one
of
course
she
adores
those
old
trinkets
the
others
do
care
two
cents
for
them
she
put
it
on
her
dress
probably
she
took
it
off
again
but
after
that
the
temptation
to
possess
the
thing
was
too
strong
for
her
she
thought
you
not
miss
it
and
she
carried
it
off
then
when
she
was
out
this
morning
she
either
threw
it
away
or
secreted
it
somewhere
perhaps
she
took
it
to
some
friend
for
safe
keeping
i
do
believe
it
fenn
i
studied
the
four
girls
pretty
closely
and
dolly
fayre
is
i
think
the
most
frank
and
honest
and
conscientious
of
them
all
why
i
suspect
either
of
my
own
nieces
before
i
would
dolly
you
generous
sir
but
you
mistaken
miss
fayre
is
the
culprit
and
we
fasten
the
theft
on
her
yet
i
hope
not
i
sincerely
hope
not
but
it
a
queer
business
fenn
a
very
queer
business
it
all
of
that
forbes
but
we
get
at
the
truth
of
it
yet
meantime
the
four
girls
were
talking
over
the
matter
but
not
all
together
the
two
d
in
their
own
room
and
the
other
two
girls
in
theirs
were
having
separate
confabs
now
dolly
fayre
dotty
was
saying
you
tell
me
everything
you
know
about
this
thing
i
do
want
any
holding
back
or
concealing
of
any
suspicions
or
doubts
you
may
have
it
is
really
a
suspicion
dotty
but
i
will
tell
you
it
only
that
just
as
we
left
the
room
the
museum
room
i
call
it
yesterday
afternoon
we
were
all
out
and
alicia
ran
back
she
said
she
had
left
her
handkerchief
on
the
table
and
she
went
straight
to
that
very
table
where
i
had
laid
the
earring
now
i
ca
suspect
alicia
but
what
she
did
well
dolly
and
dotty
looked
thoughtful
that
enough
to
cast
suspicion
on
her
she
went
to
that
very
table
yes
of
course
i
did
think
anything
about
it
at
the
time
but
now
i
remember
it
distinctly
that
why
i
wanted
to
go
home
and
tell
mother
all
about
it
and
ask
her
if
i
ought
to
tell
forbes
about
alicia
i
see
i
do
know
myself
what
you
ought
to
do
i
been
thinking
it
might
be
alicia
all
the
time
i
hate
to
suspect
her
as
much
as
you
do
but
if
she
ran
back
and
went
to
that
table
and
then
the
jewel
that
laid
there
was
gone
it
certainly
looks
queer
decidedly
queer
well
what
shall
i
do
i
suppose
you
have
to
keep
still
unless
you
actually
accused
of
taking
it
you
ca
very
well
tell
on
alicia
that
what
i
think
but
if
they
really
accuse
you
and
fenn
has
already
done
so
oh
fenn
i
do
care
what
he
says
if
forbes
does
think
i
took
it
i
do
want
to
say
anything
about
alicia
well
let
wait
and
see
after
what
you
just
told
me
i
think
she
did
take
it
but
i
do
want
to
think
that
now
in
the
next
room
alicia
and
bernice
were
talking
confidentially
and
in
low
tones
of
course
dolly
must
have
taken
it
alicia
said
slowly
i
ca
believe
that
said
bernice
i
know
dolly
fayre
awfully
well
and
i
just
about
know
she
could
do
such
a
thing
i
daresay
she
never
was
tempted
before
you
ca
tell
what
you
may
do
until
there
a
sudden
temptation
she
might
have
thought
it
was
no
harm
when
uncle
jeff
has
so
many
of
such
trinkets
she
might
have
thought
he
never
miss
it
no
dissented
bernice
dolly
never
thought
out
those
things
if
she
did
take
it
it
was
just
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
as
you
say
because
of
a
sudden
irresistible
temptation
and
the
minute
after
she
was
doubtless
sorry
but
then
she
was
ashamed
to
confess
or
return
it
it
was
luncheon
time
then
and
the
girls
went
downstairs
together
with
no
disclosures
of
their
suspicions
of
each
other
at
the
luncheon
table
the
subject
was
freely
discussed
dolly
explained
to
berry
that
after
she
had
telephoned
she
was
going
home
she
felt
that
it
was
a
cowardly
thing
to
do
and
that
she
ought
to
remain
and
see
the
matter
through
you
see
dolly
said
smiling
it
was
a
sudden
temptation
when
i
got
to
the
station
to
go
home
just
the
sight
of
the
ticket
office
and
the
train
gates
gave
me
a
wave
of
homesickness
and
i
wanted
to
see
mother
so
terribly
that
i
thought
i
just
go
but
as
soon
as
telephoned
i
realised
that
i
ought
to
do
it
so
i
came
right
back
here
i
did
telephone
i
changed
my
mind
for
i
thought
i
be
here
so
soon
berry
what
do
you
think
became
of
the
earring
i
do
know
i
sure
my
dear
i
do
think
i
could
ever
believe
that
any
one
of
you
girls
took
it
with
any
wrong
intent
did
one
of
you
just
borrow
it
to
study
it
as
a
curio
or
anything
like
that
no
cried
bernice
that
absurd
if
i
wanted
to
do
that
i
should
have
asked
uncle
permission
of
course
you
would
and
good
berry
sighed
at
the
undoubted
fallacy
of
her
theory
it
was
during
luncheon
that
the
telephone
bell
rang
and
geordie
knapp
invited
the
girls
to
a
matinee
at
the
hippodrome
they
must
come
he
said
to
berry
who
had
answered
his
call
please
let
them
it
a
big
party
we
three
boxes
my
mother
is
going
with
us
and
all
the
rest
are
young
people
i
know
your
girls
will
like
it
of
course
they
will
berry
replied
i
be
glad
to
have
them
go
wait
i
ask
them
the
invitation
was
heard
with
delight
and
bernice
answered
geordie
for
the
others
that
they
all
be
glad
to
go
good
cried
geordie
we
call
for
you
in
our
big
car
be
ready
on
time
they
promised
and
hastened
through
luncheon
to
go
to
dress
i
glad
you
going
kind
berry
said
it
take
your
minds
off
this
old
earring
business
have
a
real
good
time
and
do
even
think
of
anything
unpleasant
so
the
girls
started
off
in
gay
spirits
resolved
not
to
worry
over
the
lost
jewel
during
the
intermission
at
the
matinee
dotty
chanced
to
be
talking
to
geordie
alone
and
she
told
him
about
the
mystery
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
the
boy
was
greatly
interested
and
asked
for
all
the
details
so
dotty
told
him
all
even
of
dolly
seeing
alicia
return
to
the
room
and
go
to
the
table
by
the
window
jiminy
crickets
said
geordie
that
looks
bad
but
i
ca
believe
alicia
would
take
it
nor
any
of
you
others
let
me
talk
to
alicia
i
wo
accuse
her
you
know
but
maybe
i
can
gather
something
from
the
way
she
talks
so
by
changing
of
seats
geordie
found
opportunity
to
talk
to
alicia
about
the
matter
to
his
surprise
she
willingly
discussed
it
and
moreover
she
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
she
suspected
dolly
of
taking
it
she
said
she
felt
sure
that
dolly
did
it
meaning
no
great
harm
but
probably
being
why
said
alicia
she
said
only
at
luncheon
that
when
she
was
at
the
railroad
station
she
was
so
tempted
to
go
home
to
her
mother
that
she
very
nearly
went
so
you
see
she
is
given
to
sudden
temptations
and
i
suppose
she
ca
always
resist
them
geordie
considered
i
do
believe
she
took
it
alicia
he
said
either
it
slipped
behind
something
or
else
somebody
else
got
in
and
took
it
it
never
was
one
of
you
four
girls
i
sure
it
was
if
i
could
be
over
there
for
an
hour
or
so
i
bet
i
could
find
it
pretty
good
at
such
things
i
go
home
with
you
after
the
show
may
i
oh
i
wish
you
would
if
you
could
find
that
thing
you
would
be
a
joy
and
a
blessing
and
so
after
the
performance
was
over
geordie
knapp
and
ted
hosmer
both
went
to
forbes
house
with
the
four
girls
alicia
asked
her
uncle
permission
for
them
all
to
go
up
to
the
museum
rooms
and
he
gave
it
he
was
not
entirely
willing
for
he
rarely
allowed
visitors
to
his
collections
but
alicia
coaxed
until
he
gave
in
it
ca
be
that
alicia
took
it
dotty
whispered
to
dolly
for
she
is
so
willing
to
have
geordie
investigate
ted
hosmer
was
as
anxious
as
geordie
to
hunt
for
the
earring
but
when
he
reached
the
rooms
of
the
collections
he
was
so
interested
in
looking
at
the
specimens
that
he
nearly
forgot
what
they
came
for
look
at
the
birds
he
cried
as
they
passed
through
the
natural
history
room
on
the
way
to
the
antiques
you
like
birds
asked
dolly
as
she
saw
his
eyes
brighten
at
the
sights
all
round
him
yes
indeed
i
a
small
collection
myself
but
nothing
like
this
i
study
about
birds
every
chance
i
get
oh
see
the
humming
birds
are
they
beautiful
but
dolly
persuaded
him
to
leave
the
birds
and
butterflies
and
go
on
to
the
antique
room
here
the
girls
told
their
two
visitors
all
about
the
earring
and
its
disappearance
fenn
was
not
present
for
which
dolly
was
deeply
grateful
forbes
watched
the
two
boys
quizzically
then
he
said
go
to
it
geordie
do
a
little
detective
work
if
any
of
my
four
visitors
took
it
make
them
own
up
i
wo
scold
them
i
anxious
only
to
know
which
one
it
was
you
do
really
think
it
was
any
of
them
i
know
forbes
or
you
would
speak
like
that
said
ted
i
know
you
think
as
i
do
that
some
queer
mischance
or
accident
is
responsible
for
the
disappearance
but
what
was
that
accident
and
where
is
the
jewel
the
two
boys
searched
methodically
they
did
not
look
into
cupboards
or
drawers
they
asked
questions
and
tried
to
think
out
some
theory
could
any
one
have
come
in
at
the
window
asked
ted
no
chance
of
that
said
forbes
considering
the
window
is
in
the
fourth
story
and
no
balcony
or
any
way
of
reaching
it
from
the
ground
geordie
stuck
his
head
out
of
the
window
in
question
who
lives
next
door
he
said
looking
across
the
narrow
yard
to
the
next
house
people
named
mortimer
replied
forbes
but
they
all
away
from
home
they
somewhere
down
south
there
somebody
over
there
i
see
a
light
in
one
of
the
rooms
a
caretaker
maybe
but
do
be
absurd
it
all
of
ten
or
twelve
feet
across
to
that
house
from
our
back
extension
to
theirs
are
you
thinking
somebody
could
spring
across
take
the
jewel
and
spring
back
again
that
is
very
likely
is
it
ted
laughed
but
there
some
explanation
somewhere
and
the
boy
shook
his
head
you
see
forbes
somebody
might
have
made
entrance
to
this
room
after
the
girls
left
it
sunday
afternoon
and
before
you
discovered
your
loss
somebody
might
agreed
forbes
but
i
ca
quite
see
how
surely
no
intruder
came
up
by
way
of
the
stairs
i
ca
believe
any
one
came
in
by
the
window
and
what
other
way
is
there
suppose
said
geordie
earnestly
suppose
the
caretaker
or
whoever
is
next
door
saw
you
people
examining
the
earring
by
the
light
from
the
window
you
were
by
the
window
were
you
yes
said
dolly
to
whom
he
had
put
the
question
yes
it
was
growing
dusk
and
i
stepped
to
the
window
to
look
at
the
gold
work
well
suppose
this
caretaker
person
saw
you
and
realised
the
jewel
was
valuable
then
suppose
after
you
all
went
out
and
left
the
earring
on
this
little
table
which
is
only
ten
or
twelve
inches
from
the
window
suppose
the
caretaker
leaned
out
of
his
window
and
with
a
long
pole
with
a
hook
on
the
end
fished
the
thing
over
to
himself
ridiculous
cried
forbes
nobody
could
do
such
a
thing
as
that
absurd
my
boy
why
even
a
long
fishpole
would
scarcely
be
long
enough
and
he
could
get
purchase
enough
on
the
end
i
admit
it
sounds
difficult
sir
but
they
do
pretty
clever
things
that
way
and
too
i
ca
suspect
my
neighbour
servants
why
i
not
the
slightest
cause
for
such
suspicion
oh
no
i
ca
think
it
that
way
either
said
dolly
why
that
caretaker
is
a
nice
old
man
i
heard
berry
tell
about
him
his
room
is
just
opposite
hers
two
floors
beneath
this
very
room
we
in
now
he
has
a
parrot
that
chatters
and
annoys
berry
but
the
old
man
is
honest
i
sure
and
he
too
old
to
be
agile
enough
to
do
such
an
acrobatic
thing
as
you
suggest
chapter
xvii
a
clever
idea
ted
hosmer
looked
at
dolly
as
she
spoke
and
a
sudden
light
came
into
his
eyes
by
jiminy
he
said
and
he
drew
a
sharp
little
whistle
i
say
dolly
where
is
your
mrs
berry
oh
no
ted
dolly
laughed
you
ca
connect
berry
with
this
matter
any
more
than
you
can
the
mortimers
servants
berry
do
it
i
did
say
she
did
returned
ted
smiling
at
her
but
where
is
she
that
all
i
do
know
probably
in
her
room
take
me
there
will
you
i
must
see
her
at
once
why
i
got
an
idea
goodness
ted
exclaimed
geordie
what
a
strange
piece
of
news
do
be
funny
said
ted
i
say
dolly
take
me
to
speak
to
berry
wo
you
why
of
course
if
you
like
come
on
dolly
led
the
way
and
ted
followed
the
others
paid
little
attention
for
geordie
was
thinking
out
a
new
theory
of
how
somebody
could
get
across
from
the
next
house
by
means
of
scuttles
to
the
roofs
on
the
front
part
of
the
houses
of
course
in
front
the
houses
were
attached
but
the
back
extensions
were
only
one
room
wide
thus
giving
ground
space
for
tiny
back
yards
a
tap
on
berry
door
was
answered
and
the
two
were
admitted
what
is
it
and
the
housekeeper
looked
a
little
surprised
at
her
visitors
may
we
look
out
of
your
window
asked
ted
politely
surely
was
the
reply
but
what
for
ted
however
already
had
raised
the
window
and
was
looking
out
it
was
dark
or
nearly
and
the
house
next
door
showed
a
dim
light
in
the
room
opposite
the
one
they
were
in
the
shade
was
down
at
the
window
so
they
saw
nothing
of
the
room
but
a
few
indistinct
shadows
tell
us
something
about
the
old
caretaker
next
door
wo
you
begged
ted
and
berry
responded
now
do
suspect
him
why
old
joe
is
the
most
honest
man
in
the
city
i
known
him
for
years
and
i
sure
he
would
steal
a
pin
mortimer
trusts
him
absolutely
but
tell
us
a
little
about
him
there
nothing
to
tell
only
that
he
stays
there
alone
when
the
family
go
away
he
lives
practically
in
the
two
rooms
that
room
opposite
and
the
kitchen
he
has
no
company
but
his
parrot
he
makes
a
great
pet
of
that
a
nice
polly
a
handsome
bird
yes
but
a
nuisance
with
its
continual
squawking
and
chattering
thank
you
berry
i
believe
that
all
pardon
our
intrusion
we
go
now
come
along
dolly
dolly
followed
ted
from
the
room
and
he
said
do
go
back
upstairs
yet
come
along
with
me
where
never
mind
come
on
and
making
a
gesture
for
her
to
be
silent
ted
piloted
her
down
the
main
staircase
and
out
of
the
front
door
gracious
i
wo
go
another
step
till
you
tell
me
where
we
going
of
course
i
tell
you
we
going
next
door
come
on
you
need
wraps
it
just
a
step
taking
her
hand
ted
led
her
down
the
forbes
steps
and
up
those
of
the
house
next
door
he
rang
the
bell
and
they
waited
in
a
moment
shuffling
steps
were
heard
and
an
old
man
opened
the
door
that
you
joe
said
ted
pleasantly
let
us
come
in
for
a
moment
please
i
do
know
you
young
sir
but
if
i
not
mistaken
this
is
one
of
the
little
ladies
from
next
door
quite
right
we
intend
no
harm
i
assure
you
let
us
come
in
for
a
minute
or
two
the
old
man
let
them
enter
and
closed
the
door
behind
them
how
your
parrot
asked
ted
conversationally
old
joe
looked
surprised
but
he
answered
courteously
polly
is
well
as
usual
what
kind
of
a
bird
is
he
a
parrot
sir
i
do
mean
that
is
he
honest
or
or
gives
to
thievery
oh
sir
he
the
thievingest
beast
in
the
world
that
he
is
i
dare
leave
a
thing
around
i
not
willing
for
him
to
take
if
he
wants
it
yes
just
so
and
does
he
ever
go
out
of
this
house
no
oh
no
ted
face
fell
dolly
too
for
she
began
to
see
what
ted
had
in
mind
but
if
polly
never
left
the
mortimer
house
surely
he
did
fly
over
and
steal
the
earring
could
i
go
up
to
the
room
where
the
bird
is
said
ted
trying
to
conceal
his
disappointment
at
the
collapse
of
his
theory
yes
sir
if
you
like
or
i
bring
the
bird
down
here
we
go
up
please
and
dolly
and
ted
followed
the
old
man
to
the
room
on
the
second
floor
which
was
opposite
berry
they
looked
in
and
saw
the
bird
in
his
cage
hanging
from
a
bracket
near
the
window
pretty
polly
said
ted
walking
toward
the
cage
nice
polly
polly
want
a
cracker
the
bird
cocked
his
head
on
one
side
but
said
nothing
and
you
sure
he
never
leaves
his
cage
said
ted
examining
the
fastening
on
the
cage
door
well
sir
he
does
leave
his
cage
i
said
he
does
leave
this
house
that
is
not
often
so
seldom
as
to
call
it
never
what
do
you
mean
by
that
well
a
few
days
ago
i
thinking
it
was
sunday
the
bird
let
himself
out
of
his
cage
the
latch
broke
do
you
see
and
he
could
push
the
door
open
with
his
claw
i
came
into
the
room
and
there
he
was
stalking
up
and
down
the
floor
with
a
knowing
look
i
soon
found
how
he
got
out
of
the
cage
and
i
fixed
the
latch
so
he
ca
do
it
again
i
let
him
out
often
but
i
not
going
to
have
him
letting
himself
out
sunday
was
it
and
dolly
eyes
brightened
as
ted
went
on
with
his
questions
and
you
were
here
when
he
got
out
of
his
cage
no
sir
but
i
came
in
soon
and
he
was
marching
along
the
floor
winking
at
me
and
was
the
window
open
old
joe
stopped
to
think
no
he
said
finally
and
dolly
gave
a
sigh
of
despair
if
the
window
had
been
open
there
was
a
possibility
that
polly
had
been
the
thief
can
he
fly
she
put
in
fly
yes
that
he
can
that
why
i
careful
to
keep
him
shut
up
here
i
would
like
him
to
fly
over
and
annoy
berry
he
did
that
once
a
year
ago
and
the
lady
was
right
down
mad
about
it
think
again
joe
could
this
window
have
been
open
sunday
when
polly
got
out
of
his
cage
well
now
i
do
believe
it
was
was
sunday
that
warm
pleasant
day
yes
well
then
come
to
think
of
it
this
here
window
was
open
my
it
was
a
good
thing
polly
did
walk
out
of
it
but
that
just
what
he
did
do
i
believe
what
sir
what
do
you
mean
well
i
tell
you
a
small
article
has
disappeared
from
the
house
next
door
from
a
room
on
this
side
just
above
berry
room
a
hard
matter
to
find
out
what
became
of
the
thing
a
small
trinket
of
jewellery
and
i
in
hopes
that
your
bird
flew
over
and
took
it
because
that
will
let
out
certain
very
much
worried
human
beings
oh
i
ca
think
polly
did
that
can
he
fly
as
far
as
to
go
up
to
that
window
two
stories
higher
than
this
you
say
he
can
fly
but
would
he
be
likely
to
fly
up
if
so
be
that
window
was
open
he
might
he
a
born
thief
that
bird
is
but
in
that
case
what
did
he
do
with
it
a
jewel
you
say
yes
an
old
very
old
earring
ah
and
joe
started
of
fine
work
but
all
broken
and
bent
i
do
know
how
about
that
dolly
it
was
old
and
it
was
fine
gold
work
but
it
was
bent
or
broken
then
it
not
the
same
said
joe
polly
has
a
lot
of
playthings
and
some
old
imitation
jewellery
that
mortimer
lets
him
have
because
he
loves
such
things
and
it
was
monday
yes
yesterday
he
had
an
old
piece
of
stuff
that
i
did
remember
seeing
before
but
i
paid
little
attention
to
it
and
it
was
that
bent
and
twisted
it
ca
have
been
the
thing
you
searching
for
no
that
it
could
i
suppose
not
said
ted
but
dolly
said
let
us
see
it
anyway
ca
you
maybe
polly
bent
it
up
himself
old
joe
went
and
searched
through
a
lot
of
broken
bits
of
metal
tilings
in
a
box
on
the
table
here
it
is
he
said
you
see
how
it
worn
out
that
it
cried
dolly
oh
ted
that
the
earring
hooray
is
it
hooray
shouted
ted
really
oh
it
too
good
to
be
true
polly
must
have
taken
it
joe
yes
he
must
have
done
so
if
miss
here
says
it
the
one
but
let
me
figger
it
out
i
when
polly
opened
his
cage
door
the
open
window
attracted
him
and
he
flew
out
then
as
the
other
windows
in
the
forbes
house
were
closed
he
made
for
that
one
that
was
open
was
nobody
in
the
room
no
said
dolly
not
when
the
jewel
was
taken
i
left
it
on
a
table
near
the
window
and
yes
miss
i
see
polly
was
tempted
by
the
glittering
thing
he
loves
glitter
and
he
snatched
it
up
and
flew
right
back
home
with
it
he
hid
it
somewhere
that
his
thievish
nature
and
when
i
came
in
here
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
floor
as
innocent
appearin
as
a
lamb
oh
you
wicked
polly
polly
screeched
the
bird
naughty
polly
yes
very
naughty
polly
said
ted
but
a
good
polly
after
all
to
get
us
out
of
our
troubles
then
you
see
continued
old
joe
that
villainous
bird
he
hid
his
treasure
and
when
i
let
him
out
yesterday
just
to
fly
around
the
room
he
found
it
out
again
and
he
hent
and
broke
it
all
up
well
never
mind
dolly
cried
as
long
as
we
have
it
oh
ted
how
clever
of
you
to
think
of
it
i
so
glad
come
let
hurry
home
and
tell
about
it
my
wo
they
all
rejoice
shall
i
go
over
and
make
my
apologies
to
mr
forbes
asked
joe
anxiously
no
at
least
not
now
forbes
wo
hold
you
at
all
to
blame
it
was
merely
coincidence
that
the
bird
happened
to
get
out
of
his
cage
just
when
the
jewel
lay
there
unprotected
said
ted
and
he
taken
something
else
if
he
had
found
that
anything
glittering
or
sparkling
catches
his
eye
and
he
steals
it
but
is
seldom
he
gets
a
chance
outside
the
house
why
do
you
keep
such
a
bird
asked
dolly
he
is
mine
i
would
care
to
have
him
he
belongs
to
mortimer
and
she
only
laughs
at
his
thievin
traits
she
thinks
they
cunning
so
i
must
needs
take
good
care
of
him
was
careless
of
me
to
leave
the
window
open
and
him
here
alone
but
i
did
think
he
could
break
loose
from
his
cage
i
thinkin
the
door
was
ajar
well
we
much
obliged
to
you
and
to
polly
oh
just
think
if
you
had
reasoned
it
out
ted
we
never
would
have
known
the
truth
you
see
joe
thought
the
earring
was
one
of
polly
own
belongings
so
of
course
he
never
would
have
paid
any
attention
to
it
that
i
would
miss
i
supposed
it
was
some
of
the
trinkets
the
missus
gave
him
she
buys
for
him
at
the
he
breaks
as
fast
as
he
gets
i
hope
this
can
be
straightened
out
and
i
think
it
can
said
dolly
as
she
looked
at
the
bent
gold
work
i
sure
it
can
agreed
ted
but
anyway
it
solves
the
mystery
and
clears
you
girls
hooray
hurroo
come
on
let
go
and
tell
them
all
the
two
dashed
into
the
forbes
house
next
door
and
found
the
rest
of
them
down
in
the
drawing
room
wondering
what
had
become
of
dolly
and
ted
with
a
beaming
face
and
dancing
eyes
dolly
went
straight
to
forbes
and
dangled
the
bent
and
twisted
earring
before
his
surprised
countenance
bless
my
soul
he
cried
as
he
saw
it
did
you
where
did
you
find
it
dolly
realised
that
he
had
been
about
to
say
did
you
decide
to
own
up
or
something
like
that
and
she
was
glad
that
he
changed
his
sentence
next
door
she
exclaimed
for
ted
stood
back
and
let
her
have
the
pleasure
of
telling
that
old
parrot
came
and
stole
it
oh
the
parrot
cried
forbes
why
of
course
i
see
it
all
why
did
think
of
that
once
before
i
saw
that
bird
light
on
my
window
sill
and
i
shooed
him
off
strange
i
did
think
of
that
solution
tell
us
more
cried
dotty
who
thought
of
a
parrot
whose
parrot
is
it
how
did
he
get
in
when
wait
a
minute
dot
said
dolly
laughing
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
you
tell
some
ted
i
all
out
of
breath
so
ted
told
the
whole
story
of
their
visit
to
the
next
house
and
i
thought
it
was
when
the
old
chap
said
the
window
in
his
room
was
open
also
when
he
said
the
bird
never
left
that
house
i
thought
again
we
were
off
the
track
but
when
we
went
on
to
discuss
the
matter
and
he
said
the
bird
was
a
born
thief
and
also
he
finally
remembered
that
his
window
was
open
on
sunday
afternoon
why
i
felt
sure
we
had
found
the
culprit
then
the
old
fellow
produced
the
earring
which
he
had
seen
but
had
scarcely
noticed
thinking
it
was
some
of
the
bird
own
junk
it
seems
polly
also
collects
antiques
well
well
hosmer
my
boy
you
did
well
to
think
of
such
a
solution
to
our
mystery
what
put
you
on
the
track
in
the
first
place
i
think
it
was
the
birds
of
your
collection
sir
i
very
fond
of
birds
and
bird
study
and
i
know
a
lot
about
parrots
and
their
ways
well
seeing
all
your
stuffed
birds
put
birds
in
my
head
i
suppose
any
way
when
dolly
spoke
of
a
parrot
next
door
that
annoyed
berry
i
thought
right
away
of
how
that
polly
bird
would
like
to
grab
a
gold
trinket
if
he
had
a
good
chance
so
i
looked
up
his
chances
and
i
began
to
realise
that
if
your
window
was
open
the
one
in
the
other
house
might
have
been
too
sunday
was
such
a
warm
pleasant
day
so
i
looked
into
matters
a
little
and
concluded
we
better
go
over
there
i
did
say
what
we
were
going
for
because
it
might
easily
have
turned
out
a
wild
goose
chase
instead
of
a
wild
parrot
chase
said
alicia
oh
is
it
just
fine
that
it
found
i
guess
old
fenn
will
be
surprised
said
dotty
with
an
angry
shake
of
her
dark
head
he
tried
his
best
to
fasten
it
on
dolly
fasten
the
earring
on
asked
geordie
knapp
laughing
no
i
did
that
myself
rejoined
dolly
oh
uncle
forbes
you
think
i
took
it
did
you
i
did
know
what
to
think
no
thought
of
that
bird
came
into
my
mind
and
so
i
had
to
cudgel
my
brain
to
think
how
it
did
disappear
for
i
had
to
know
yes
i
positively
had
to
know
of
course
agreed
bernice
you
did
want
to
lose
that
jewel
it
was
only
that
there
was
another
reason
a
reason
that
i
tell
you
some
day
chapter
xviii
four
celebrations
next
morning
at
breakfast
each
of
the
four
girls
found
a
note
at
her
plate
the
notes
were
all
alike
and
they
read
jefferson
forbes
because
of
his
great
delight
over
the
discovery
of
his
lost
piece
of
property
invites
you
to
a
celebration
occasion
thursday
evening
forbes
would
say
also
that
he
has
obtained
the
consent
of
all
interested
parents
that
you
may
stay
till
saturday
jefferson
forbes
will
be
glad
of
suggestions
as
to
what
form
said
celebration
shall
assume
they
all
laughed
at
the
formal
style
and
stilted
language
of
the
notes
and
were
amazed
at
the
information
that
they
were
to
make
a
longer
visit
than
they
had
thought
berry
smiled
at
the
shower
of
questions
that
followed
the
reading
of
the
notes
but
she
only
said
do
ask
me
my
dears
after
breakfast
forbes
will
meet
you
in
the
reception
room
and
discuss
it
so
a
merry
group
of
four
awaited
the
coming
of
their
host
in
the
pretty
little
reception
room
good
morning
he
said
cheerily
as
he
entered
what
an
attractive
bunch
of
humanity
four
smiling
faces
and
eight
bright
eyes
i
greet
you
all
with
an
bow
he
took
a
seat
near
them
and
asked
did
you
receive
certain
important
documents
we
did
replied
bernice
may
we
have
further
enlightenment
you
may
and
first
i
will
remove
that
anxious
look
from
dolly
face
by
saying
that
her
mother
is
perfectly
willing
that
she
should
stay
here
the
rest
of
the
week
oh
goody
cried
dolly
how
did
you
ask
her
by
telephone
yes
so
pleased
was
i
over
the
developments
of
last
evening
that
i
telephoned
all
the
powers
that
be
and
arranged
for
an
extension
to
our
house
party
are
you
glad
indeed
we
are
chorused
the
girls
and
uncle
jeff
went
on
now
our
celebration
is
to
be
just
whatever
you
want
and
if
you
all
want
the
same
thing
you
can
all
have
different
things
so
just
state
your
preferences
i
know
mine
said
alicia
it
is
to
go
to
muriel
brown
party
on
friday
night
she
asked
us
and
i
love
to
go
that
one
said
her
uncle
of
course
you
can
all
go
to
the
party
now
bernice
what
do
you
choose
i
like
to
go
to
the
opera
said
bernice
grand
opera
i
mean
never
been
but
once
and
i
love
to
go
good
we
go
if
you
all
agree
they
certainly
did
agree
to
that
and
then
forbes
asked
the
two
to
choose
i
want
to
go
to
the
metropolitan
museum
with
you
said
dolly
half
afraid
to
ask
such
a
boon
but
forbes
seemed
pleased
and
declared
he
would
be
delighted
to
go
with
her
and
explain
the
exhibits
and
the
others
could
go
or
not
as
they
liked
all
decided
in
favour
of
going
and
then
dotty
was
asked
to
choose
do
laugh
at
me
said
dotty
but
i
like
to
have
a
party
only
not
a
big
one
just
us
four
girls
and
the
four
boys
that
we
know
the
best
geordie
ted
marly
turner
and
sam
graves
i
like
that
sort
of
a
party
better
than
the
big
dressy
ones
why
dot
rose
exclaimed
alicia
i
thought
you
liked
the
big
dances
so
i
do
if
i
knew
the
people
but
i
think
it
would
be
lots
of
fun
to
have
a
few
and
have
a
less
formal
party
i
like
to
ask
muriel
brown
and
two
or
three
of
those
girls
we
met
with
her
the
other
day
and
then
have
a
few
more
boys
but
not
a
hundred
like
muriel
had
a
good
plan
said
forbes
because
you
could
invite
a
large
party
on
such
short
notice
so
make
out
your
list
dotty
and
invite
them
by
telephone
at
once
berry
will
help
you
and
will
arrange
all
details
let
me
see
you
can
have
that
party
night
go
to
the
opera
go
to
muriel
party
on
friday
night
and
go
home
on
saturday
the
museum
we
can
visit
any
afternoon
i
thank
you
for
your
kind
attention
oh
uncle
jeff
we
thank
you
for
your
kindness
all
of
it
cried
alicia
you
have
been
so
very
good
to
us
and
now
you
are
doing
a
lot
more
for
our
pleasure
have
you
enjoyed
it
all
so
far
alicia
and
her
uncle
looked
at
her
inquiringly
oh
yes
sir
indeed
i
have
i
was
troubled
about
the
lost
earring
but
that
was
not
your
fault
nor
the
fault
of
any
of
you
girls
said
forbes
as
i
have
hinted
to
you
i
have
a
reason
for
this
visit
you
are
making
me
beside
a
desire
to
give
you
pleasure
i
am
considering
a
serious
matter
and
this
stay
of
yours
in
my
house
is
helping
me
to
a
decision
what
can
it
be
uncle
cried
bernice
tell
us
so
we
can
help
you
more
and
more
intelligently
i
will
tell
you
saturday
morning
he
returned
with
a
smile
perhaps
in
that
time
other
developments
may
occur
that
will
alter
my
final
decision
in
the
matter
it
sounds
most
mysterious
laughed
dolly
ca
we
guess
what
all
about
you
may
guess
if
you
like
but
i
do
promise
to
tell
you
if
you
guess
correctly
and
i
do
mind
adding
that
i
feel
pretty
sure
you
could
guess
correctly
if
you
tried
no
use
trying
then
said
alicia
gaily
oh
i
so
glad
we
going
to
stay
longer
i
want
to
do
a
lot
of
things
beside
the
celebrations
we
just
planned
i
do
think
you
the
best
and
kindest
uncle
in
the
whole
world
i
got
a
secret
too
and
some
day
i
going
to
tell
it
to
you
all
secrets
seem
to
be
the
order
of
the
day
laughed
dolly
we
have
to
scrape
up
one
dot
well
it
no
secret
that
we
having
one
grand
glorious
good
time
said
dotty
what
on
for
this
morning
forbes
went
off
to
his
own
room
then
and
the
girls
planned
out
all
they
should
do
for
the
rest
of
their
stay
in
the
city
there
was
some
shopping
some
and
some
errands
yet
undone
but
they
at
last
agreed
on
a
programme
that
would
suit
everybody
dotty
party
as
they
called
it
took
place
on
thursday
night
and
she
had
her
way
about
having
it
a
small
gathering
there
were
about
twenty
in
all
and
according
to
dotty
wishes
it
was
not
only
a
dancing
party
there
were
games
as
well
as
dances
for
dotty
loved
games
some
of
the
city
young
people
were
at
first
inclined
to
laugh
at
the
idea
of
games
but
when
they
began
to
take
part
in
these
that
dotty
had
planned
they
became
exceedingly
interested
one
was
an
observation
test
up
in
forbes
museum
at
dotty
request
he
had
allowed
the
collection
rooms
to
be
opened
to
the
guests
and
this
very
special
dispensation
was
so
appreciated
by
all
that
they
were
most
exceedingly
careful
not
to
handle
the
rare
specimens
or
touch
the
exhibits
this
state
of
things
lent
itself
beautifully
to
the
game
each
player
was
asked
to
walk
about
for
half
an
hour
and
look
at
the
curios
and
treasures
and
at
the
expiration
of
the
time
to
return
to
the
drawing
room
and
spend
ten
minutes
writing
down
the
names
of
such
objects
as
could
be
remembered
this
game
most
of
them
had
played
before
with
a
table
full
of
less
interesting
exhibits
but
in
the
wonderful
museum
rooms
of
forbes
it
was
quite
another
story
so
eagerly
did
the
young
people
observe
and
examine
the
things
that
the
half
hour
allotted
for
that
purpose
slipped
away
all
too
soon
and
then
they
sat
down
to
write
their
lists
and
that
too
proved
an
absorbing
occupation
our
four
girls
wrote
lists
just
for
fun
but
did
not
compete
for
the
prizes
as
knowing
the
exhibit
so
well
that
would
not
have
been
fair
muriel
brown
took
the
first
prize
and
the
hostesses
were
glad
of
it
for
it
was
pleasant
to
have
muriel
so
honoured
the
prize
was
a
gold
penholder
and
the
boys
prize
which
marly
turner
won
was
a
similar
gift
after
it
was
over
another
game
was
played
this
was
ribbon
cutting
girls
and
boys
stood
at
either
end
of
the
long
to
each
girl
was
given
the
end
of
a
piece
of
long
narrow
ribbon
and
a
pair
of
scissors
the
other
end
of
each
ribbon
was
held
by
a
boy
who
likewise
had
a
pair
of
scissors
at
a
signal
each
player
started
cutting
the
ribbon
straight
through
the
middle
if
the
scissors
slipped
and
cut
through
the
selvage
the
player
was
out
of
the
game
it
was
not
easy
for
the
ribbon
was
narrow
and
there
was
a
strong
impulse
to
hurry
which
made
for
crooked
cutting
the
middle
of
each
piece
of
ribbon
was
marked
by
a
knot
and
whoever
reached
the
knot
first
was
the
winner
of
that
pair
the
one
who
finished
first
of
all
received
a
special
prize
the
game
caused
great
laughter
and
sport
and
the
city
young
people
declared
they
enjoyed
it
quite
as
much
as
dancing
then
the
feast
was
served
and
very
beautiful
and
elaborate
it
was
the
celebration
forbes
had
said
was
to
be
especially
for
the
two
d
as
it
was
dotty
choice
and
dolly
choice
of
a
visit
to
the
museum
provided
little
opportunity
for
gaiety
the
table
showed
two
great
floral
d
one
at
either
end
dotty
was
made
of
red
roses
and
dolly
of
pink
roses
every
guest
had
as
a
souvenir
some
pretty
and
valuable
little
trinket
and
at
every
place
was
a
small
d
made
of
flowers
cakes
ices
jellies
and
all
such
things
as
could
be
so
shaped
were
cut
in
the
form
of
d
and
our
two
girls
felt
greatly
honoured
to
see
their
initial
so
prominently
and
beautifully
displayed
in
the
centre
of
the
table
was
a
huge
french
doll
of
the
finest
type
it
was
dressed
in
silk
covered
with
polka
dots
and
its
hat
and
parasol
were
of
silk
to
match
everybody
laughed
when
forbes
pointed
out
that
it
was
dotty
dolly
and
all
agreed
it
was
a
most
clever
and
appropriate
symbol
after
supper
there
was
dancing
and
a
fine
orchestra
furnished
the
music
our
girls
liked
dancing
pretty
well
but
often
they
sat
out
a
dance
talking
to
one
or
another
of
their
guests
once
as
dolly
passed
along
the
hall
chatting
with
geordie
knapp
they
heard
rather
loud
voices
behind
the
closed
door
of
the
little
reception
room
rather
surprised
that
the
door
should
be
shut
at
all
that
evening
dolly
paused
involuntarily
and
geordie
stood
by
her
side
they
had
no
intention
of
eavesdropping
indeed
geordie
thought
perhaps
some
new
game
was
about
to
be
announced
but
to
dolly
amazement
she
heard
alicia
voice
saying
oh
i
can
not
i
dare
not
the
tones
were
quivering
with
emotion
and
dolly
could
help
listening
for
the
next
words
she
feared
alicia
was
troubled
about
something
indeed
she
did
know
what
she
feared
and
next
came
a
voice
that
was
unmistakably
marly
turner
saying
do
dear
oh
trust
me
will
take
care
of
you
but
it
is
a
desperate
step
exclaimed
alicia
if
i
should
ever
regret
it
you
will
not
regret
it
dearest
marly
said
i
will
never
let
you
regret
it
your
own
mother
eloped
it
is
fitting
you
should
do
so
too
dolly
looked
at
geordie
her
face
white
with
horror
alicia
planning
an
elopement
and
with
marly
turner
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
do
said
geordie
do
you
get
mixed
up
in
a
thing
like
that
is
alicia
steele
that
sort
of
a
girl
i
do
know
faltered
dolly
i
heard
bernice
hint
once
that
alicia
mother
did
elope
with
her
father
but
alicia
why
she
seventeen
yet
well
that
old
enough
to
know
what
she
about
i
advise
you
dolly
not
to
go
in
there
tell
forbes
if
you
like
oh
i
could
tell
on
alicia
and
then
as
they
still
stood
there
too
fascinated
to
move
away
alicia
said
yes
night
i
will
steal
out
after
the
house
is
quiet
oh
my
hero
my
idol
my
angel
exclaimed
marly
in
a
deep
thrilled
voice
and
dolly
turned
away
sick
at
heart
i
do
know
what
to
do
she
said
to
geordie
as
they
went
on
to
the
drawing
room
where
the
dancers
were
do
do
anything
he
advised
it
none
of
your
business
that
steele
girl
is
like
you
she
a
different
type
if
she
wants
to
cut
up
such
didoes
do
you
mix
in
it
let
her
alone
i
knew
marly
liked
her
he
said
so
but
i
did
suppose
he
do
such
a
thing
as
that
but
i
sha
say
a
word
to
him
we
good
friends
but
not
chums
marly
a
good
chap
but
he
awfully
anxious
to
act
grown
up
and
my
stars
he
doing
so
elope
with
the
steele
girl
jiminy
i
bear
to
tell
on
alicia
said
dolly
and
yet
i
ca
think
i
ought
to
let
her
go
ahead
and
do
this
thing
she
so
fond
of
romance
and
excitement
she
does
realise
what
she
doing
later
on
dolly
saw
alicia
and
young
turner
emerge
from
the
reception
room
and
saunter
toward
the
drawing
room
they
were
talking
earnestly
in
whispers
alicia
cheeks
were
pink
and
her
manner
a
little
excited
marly
looked
important
and
bore
himself
with
a
more
grown
up
air
than
usual
dolly
and
geordie
looked
at
each
other
and
shook
their
heads
it
was
only
too
evident
that
the
two
were
planning
some
secret
doings
they
went
off
by
themselves
and
sat
on
a
davenport
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
continued
to
converse
in
whispers
oblivious
to
all
about
them
dolly
and
geordie
purposely
walked
past
the
other
pair
and
distinctly
heard
marly
say
something
about
a
rope
ladder
it
part
of
the
performance
he
urged
as
alicia
seemed
to
demur
then
she
smiled
sweetly
at
him
and
said
all
right
then
just
as
you
say
it
perfectly
awful
said
dolly
as
they
walked
on
i
simply
got
to
tell
dotty
anyway
oh
i
would
expostulated
geordie
i
do
believe
they
pull
it
off
somebody
will
catch
on
and
put
a
stop
to
it
maybe
and
maybe
not
said
dolly
dubiously
alicia
is
awfully
clever
and
if
she
sets
out
to
do
a
thing
she
generally
carries
it
through
and
her
head
is
full
of
crazy
romantic
thoughts
she
rather
elope
than
to
go
back
to
school
i
know
she
would
she
told
me
she
do
anything
to
get
out
of
going
back
to
school
that
makes
it
look
serious
agreed
geordie
still
i
do
think
you
ought
to
mix
yourself
up
in
it
unless
you
just
tell
the
whole
story
to
mr
forbes
i
hate
to
be
a
and
dolly
looked
scornful
but
if
for
alicia
good
maybe
i
ought
to
look
at
them
now
their
heads
close
together
and
whispering
like
everything
yes
they
planning
for
their
getaway
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
dolly
watched
alicia
feeling
mean
to
do
it
and
yet
unable
to
keep
herself
from
it
at
last
the
guests
went
home
one
and
all
exclaiming
at
the
good
time
they
had
had
marly
turner
bade
dolly
good
night
with
a
smiling
face
i
had
the
time
of
my
life
he
declared
i
not
seen
much
of
you
said
dolly
pointedly
i
know
it
too
bad
i
wanted
to
dance
with
you
oftener
but
the
time
was
so
short
and
you
found
another
charmer
well
alicia
sure
is
a
wonder
is
she
you
know
she
is
yes
she
is
said
dolly
and
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
frown
on
the
youth
marly
went
off
and
the
others
followed
i
not
going
to
talk
things
over
said
dolly
when
the
four
were
alone
i
tired
and
i
going
straight
to
bed
chapter
xix
alicia
secret
the
time
seemed
fairly
to
fly
each
of
the
four
girls
had
some
last
few
errands
to
do
each
wanted
some
little
souvenirs
for
herself
or
for
her
people
at
home
and
so
busy
were
they
that
there
was
not
so
much
mutual
conversation
among
them
as
usual
they
were
to
go
home
on
saturday
and
already
it
was
friday
afternoon
they
had
finished
luncheon
alicia
and
bernice
had
gone
to
their
room
and
dolly
was
about
to
go
upstairs
when
she
remembered
that
she
had
planned
to
run
in
and
say
to
old
joe
and
his
parrot
dolly
felt
she
owed
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
polly
and
she
had
bought
a
little
toy
for
him
i
going
to
run
in
next
door
a
minute
she
said
to
berry
very
well
my
dear
here
a
cracker
for
polly
dolly
took
it
laughingly
and
went
out
to
the
hall
put
your
coat
round
you
called
out
berry
it
only
a
step
i
know
but
it
a
very
cold
day
oh
dot
just
took
my
coat
upstairs
with
her
own
well
alicia
hanging
on
the
hall
rack
i
throw
this
round
me
she
did
so
and
ran
out
of
the
front
door
and
up
the
steps
of
the
next
house
old
joe
answered
her
ring
at
the
bell
just
ran
over
to
say
laughed
dolly
and
to
bring
a
cracker
and
a
toy
for
polly
thank
you
miss
and
joe
smiled
at
her
i
bring
the
bird
down
to
you
to
save
your
going
upstairs
all
right
said
dolly
a
little
for
she
was
thinking
of
a
lot
of
things
at
once
still
absentmindedly
she
put
her
hand
in
her
coat
pocket
for
a
handkerchief
there
was
none
there
and
she
drew
out
a
letter
instead
then
she
suddenly
remembered
she
had
on
alicia
coat
and
with
a
glance
at
the
envelope
she
thrust
the
letter
back
in
the
pocket
but
that
one
glance
sufficed
to
show
her
it
was
in
marly
handwriting
she
had
had
a
note
from
him
a
day
or
two
ago
inviting
her
to
some
party
or
other
and
his
striking
sprawling
penmanship
was
unmistakable
the
letter
had
been
opened
and
dolly
remembered
that
alicia
had
had
several
letters
in
the
mail
that
morning
it
all
recalled
to
her
the
talk
she
had
overheard
the
night
before
all
that
morning
alicia
had
seemed
preoccupied
and
twice
she
had
gone
off
by
herself
to
telephone
in
a
booth
which
the
girls
rarely
used
for
they
had
no
secrets
from
one
another
dolly
thought
over
the
situation
between
alicia
and
young
turner
she
had
not
told
dotty
yet
she
had
two
minds
about
doing
so
it
seemed
to
her
one
minute
that
she
had
no
right
to
interfere
in
alicia
affairs
and
then
again
it
seemed
as
if
she
ought
to
tell
forbes
what
was
going
on
she
had
heard
alicia
say
to
marly
that
they
would
elope
that
very
night
and
she
felt
sure
they
meant
to
do
so
they
were
all
going
to
muriel
brown
party
that
being
alicia
own
choice
of
the
celebrations
would
she
elope
from
the
party
or
return
home
first
the
latter
probably
for
they
had
mentioned
a
rope
ladder
and
that
seemed
as
if
alicia
meant
to
go
late
at
night
when
all
the
others
were
asleep
if
she
ran
away
from
the
party
there
would
be
no
need
of
a
rope
ladder
dolly
had
asked
bernice
if
alicia
mother
had
eloped
and
bernice
had
said
she
thought
she
had
though
she
had
never
heard
any
of
the
particulars
and
then
joe
came
down
with
the
parrot
and
dolly
forgot
alicia
and
her
elopement
for
the
moment
polly
showed
great
delight
over
his
gifts
and
after
a
few
words
of
to
the
bird
and
to
old
joe
dolly
ran
back
again
in
the
hall
she
took
off
alicia
coat
and
hung
it
on
the
rack
just
as
alicia
herself
appeared
on
the
stairs
where
you
been
she
called
out
gaily
next
door
said
dolly
to
say
a
fond
farewell
to
polly
mortimer
and
as
my
coat
was
upstairs
i
took
the
liberty
of
wearing
yours
that
all
right
laughed
alicia
you
welcome
to
it
i
sure
oh
i
say
dolly
there
a
letter
in
the
pocket
of
it
i
hope
you
did
read
it
alicia
steele
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
to
hint
at
such
a
thing
there
there
do
flare
up
over
nothing
i
only
said
i
hoped
you
did
did
you
i
consider
that
question
insulting
yes
people
often
get
out
of
answering
that
way
now
you
answered
me
yet
did
you
or
did
you
not
read
that
letter
that
in
the
pocket
of
my
coat
i
did
not
but
i
my
opinion
of
a
girl
who
could
even
think
i
do
such
a
thing
well
you
had
plenty
of
time
and
when
you
were
in
next
door
would
have
been
a
good
opportunity
i
not
sure
i
believe
you
even
yet
you
blushing
like
fury
who
would
at
being
insulted
like
that
i
do
think
you
can
have
much
sense
of
honour
yourself
to
think
anybody
decent
would
read
another
person
letter
now
do
get
huffy
little
goldilocks
and
alicia
laughed
at
her
i
had
to
be
sure
you
see
because
it
a
most
important
matter
and
i
would
have
anybody
know
for
the
world
until
i
get
ready
to
tell
myself
and
when
will
you
be
ready
to
tell
dolly
tried
to
speak
lightly
but
the
words
nearly
choked
her
i
dunno
maybe
you
know
about
it
oh
alicia
dolly
meant
to
speak
a
word
of
warning
or
of
pleading
indeed
she
did
quite
know
what
she
was
going
to
say
but
just
then
dotty
and
bernice
came
down
stairs
and
proposed
they
all
go
for
a
motor
ride
and
a
last
visit
to
the
pretty
tearoom
dolly
agreed
but
alicia
did
seem
quite
willing
i
expecting
a
telephone
message
she
said
at
last
you
girls
go
on
and
leave
me
at
home
i
sha
mind
oh
no
said
dotty
we
four
ca
be
together
after
we
must
be
separated
this
last
day
of
all
come
on
but
it
an
important
message
and
alicia
looked
anxious

i
be
of
help
said
berry
coming
toward
them
yes
cried
dotty
let
berry
take
the
message
and
tell
her
what
answer
to
make
no
answer
said
alicia
slowly
and
a
pink
flush
rose
to
her
cheeks
but
just
take
the
message
if
you
please
dear
berry
it
will
be
short
i
know
jot
it
down
lest
you
forget
the
exact
wording
berry
promised
and
the
four
ran
away
to
get
ready
for
their
last
afternoon
together
dress
up
pretty
girls
alicia
called
from
her
room
no
telling
whom
we
might
meet
at
the
tearoom
that
so
said
dotty
put
on
your
dresden
silk
doll
dolly
laughingly
agreed
and
the
four
young
ladies
started
off
a
few
calls
at
various
shops
a
few
stops
to
look
once
more
at
certain
points
of
interest
they
admired
and
then
for
a
long
drive
through
the
parks
and
finally
to
the
tearoom
how
short
the
time
has
been
said
bernice
as
they
flew
along
yes
assented
alicia
it
does
seem
possible
we
been
here
as
long
as
we
have
oh
i
do
want
to
go
home
i
wish
i
could
live
in
new
york
i
just
love
it
i
like
it
said
dolly
but
i
do
want
to
live
here
i
like
to
come
here
oftener
than
i
do
though
at
the
tearoom
they
found
janet
knapp
and
corinne
bell
two
girls
whom
they
had
come
to
know
very
pleasantly
sit
here
with
us
called
out
janet
as
they
entered
we
ordered
yet
what
do
you
girls
want
cafe
frappe
for
me
said
dotty
and
waffles
thick
chocolate
and
whipped
cream
for
mine
said
alicia
oh
when
shall
i
ever
get
these
lovely
things
again
think
of
going
back
to
diet
do
you
have
good
things
to
eat
at
that
nice
school
asked
dolly
oh
good
enough
but
not
lovely
fancy
things
like
these
i
like
to
go
to
said
janet
but
mother
want
me
away
from
home
she
thinks
girls
get
no
home
training
at
those
fashionable
schools
we
do
and
that
a
fact
admitted
alicia
we
taught
manners
and
oh
well
i
it
up
to
the
girl
herself
as
to
what
she
learns
maybe
i
wo
go
back
to
school
after
all
oh
alicia
cried
bernice
what
do
you
mean
oh
nothing
and
alicia
smiled
as
she
tossed
her
head
i
got
a
secret
i
ca
tell
you
now
maybe
you
know
soon
dolly
looked
at
alicia
in
bewilderment
could
she
be
referring
to
her
intended
elopement
with
marly
turner
good
gracious
what
do
you
mean
and
janet
laughed
never
mind
returned
alicia
airily
do
ask
me
any
questions
you
know
they
call
me
awful
alicia
so
be
prepared
for
anything
dolly
grew
thoughtful
only
she
and
geordie
knapp
held
the
secret
of
alicia
strange
remarks
and
she
could
decide
whether
it
was
her
duty
to
tell
anyone
of
her
knowledge
or
not
she
made
up
her
mind
to
tell
berry
as
soon
as
she
went
home
and
then
she
had
compunctions
about
that
for
dolly
was
very
conscientious
and
she
really
did
know
what
was
right
to
do
i
go
to
an
awfully
nice
school
corinne
bell
said
it
quite
near
my
house
and
i
can
go
alone
every
day
we
have
such
interesting
teachers
and
such
a
jolly
lot
of
girls
you
love
it
alicia
yes
i
love
it
but
how
could
i
go
there
it
is
a
boarding
school
is
it
no
but
could
you
board
somewhere
in
new
york
alone
no
i
should
say
not
you
know
i
live
out
in
the
western
wilds
at
least
the
middle
western
wilds
and
i
think
they
wilder
than
the
far
west
this
little
new
york
visit
is
all
poor
alicia
will
see
of
the
glittering
metropolis
for
oh
well
it
may
be
for
years
and
it
may
be
forever
what
do
you
do
in
vacation
time
asked
janet
oh
dad
and
i
go
to
summery
places
could
come
to
new
york
then
you
know
but
when
i
get
married
i
going
to
live
in
new
york
you
can
bet
on
that
you
not
thinking
of
marrying
soon
i
hope
and
janet
laughed
never
can
tell
said
alicia
smiling
saucily
i
have
all
sorts
of
wonderful
schemes
in
my
noodle
some
of
materialise
some
do
but
trust
little
alicia
to
do
something
big
oh
girls
my
secret
is
just
too
splendid
is
it
is
it
all
right
and
dolly
stammered
as
she
looked
at
alicia
with
a
doubtful
glance
is
it
all
right
you
little
prude
you
bet
it
all
right
maybe
we
meet
again
janet
you
ca
always
sometimes
tell
i
hope
you
come
to
berwick
to
visit
me
alicia
said
bernice
i
think
as
we
cousins
we
ought
to
see
more
of
each
other
i
love
to
bernie
maybe
i
come
this
summer
we
could
have
a
sort
of
reunion
at
our
house
went
on
bernice
muriel
and
you
girls
could
come
for
a
few
days
and
the
two
d
and
i
would
be
there
and
we
scare
up
a
lot
of
fun
we
would
i
surely
come
if
it
can
be
arranged
but
i
never
know
dad
plans
from
one
day
to
the
next
alicia
said
hello
girls
sang
out
a
boyish
voice
and
in
came
geordie
knapp
with
half
a
dozen
comrades
we
just
sorter
kinder
thought
we
see
a
bunch
of
peaches
here
about
this
time
o
day
hello
everybody
marly
turner
was
not
among
the
group
and
dolly
looked
anxiously
at
geordie
as
if
to
ask
him
what
he
knew
concerning
him
what
is
it
dolly
asked
geordie
with
a
blank
look
secret
laughed
dolly
come
over
here
and
whisper
to
me
oh
how
rude
cried
alicia
even
out
west
we
do
whisper
in
polite
society
but
this
is
a
special
case
and
dolly
smiled
and
dimpled
as
if
about
to
discuss
the
most
trivial
subject
with
geordie
the
boy
looked
surprised
when
dolly
spoke
to
him
about
what
they
had
overheard
the
night
before
why
he
said
i
never
gave
it
another
thought
i
do
believe
they
really
meant
what
we
thought
they
did
yes
they
did
asserted
dolly
all
day
alicia
has
been
keyed
up
to
some
great
excitement
she
had
a
letter
from
marly
this
morning
and
she
expects
a
telephone
from
him
also
she
said
things
that
could
only
mean
that
they
really
are
going
to
elope
such
as
what
she
said
maybe
she
live
in
new
york
soon
and
said
she
had
a
big
wonderful
secret
and
we
know
it
why
she
even
said
she
expects
to
live
in
new
york
after
she
married
whew
that
going
some
still
dolly
i
do
just
see
what
we
can
do
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
forbes
do
you
i
do
know
i
do
hate
tell
other
people
secrets
yes
so
do
i
perhaps
i
just
tell
mrs
berry
i
say
i
an
idea
suppose
i
get
hold
of
turner
and
get
him
to
go
home
and
spend
the
evening
with
me
i
insist
upon
it
you
know
and
if
he
objects
i
ask
him
what
up
oh
yes
geordie
that
will
be
fine
you
do
that
will
you
yes
suppose
i
telephone
him
now
and
ask
him
go
ahead
and
then
tell
me
what
he
says
geordie
excused
himself
and
went
off
to
the
telephone
booth
you
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
secrets
too
dolly
said
alicia
yes
i
have
and
dolly
looked
demure
ca
let
you
have
all
the
fun
nothing
doing
geordie
reported
to
dolly
as
he
came
back
and
his
face
looked
more
serious
he
made
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
her
alone
again
and
he
said
i
got
him
all
right
and
he
said
he
could
see
me
this
evening
for
he
awful
busy
said
he
was
busy
with
his
father
his
father
why
turner
is
an
actor
is
he
sure
he
is
one
of
the
best
then
how
can
marly
be
with
him
is
turner
acting
not
just
now
he
rehearsing
i
think
well
i
believe
marly
made
that
up
he
planning
the
elopement
i
afraid
he
is
he
was
sort
of
queer
and
did
answer
as
straightforwardly
as
he
usually
does
oh
what
a
silly
performance
to
cut
up
why
they
just
a
couple
of
kids
i
know
it
i
never
was
mixed
up
in
a
thing
like
this
before
you
not
mixed
up
in
this
no
not
unless
i
mix
in
purposely
and
i
believe
i
shall
have
to
you
see
i
only
a
country
girl
and
i
do
know
what
right
to
do
in
this
case
but
i
going
to
follow
my
instinct
and
tell
either
forbes
or
berry
i
do
think
i
tell
dot
or
bernice
for
they
have
no
more
knowledge
of
what
right
to
do
than
i
have
myself
you
a
good
deal
of
a
trump
dolly
fayre
but
i
think
you
in
a
hard
place
i
wish
i
could
help
you
and
i
do
anything
you
say
could
you
go
to
mr
turner
i
hate
to
yer
see
us
fellows
do
tell
on
each
other
it
done
i
know
well
let
hope
we
mistaken
but
i
do
see
how
we
can
be
what
we
heard
neither
do
i
a
mind
to
speak
straight
out
to
alicia
about
it
do
if
you
think
best
well
i
see
chapter
xx
uncle
jeff
four
friends
still
uncertain
what
she
do
dolly
went
home
with
the
rest
of
the
quartette
alicia
was
in
high
spirits
constantly
exclaiming
oh
if
you
only
knew
what
i
know
or
i
terribly
excited
over
my
secret
just
you
wait
till
or
some
such
speech
and
as
they
entered
the
forbes
house
she
flew
to
berry
demanding
to
know
if
a
telephone
message
had
arrived
for
her
yes
replied
the
housekeeper
marly
turner
called
up
and
he
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
everything
was
all
right
and
pull
it
off
sure
oh
goody
cried
alicia
are
you
sure
that
just
what
he
said
yes
asseverated
berry
see
i
wrote
it
down
so
i
forget
dolly
had
to
eavesdrop
a
little
to
overhear
this
conversation
as
alicia
had
drawn
berry
aside
to
make
her
inquiries
and
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
dolly
went
upstairs
to
lay
off
her
wraps
oh
girls
i
so
happy
cried
alicia
as
she
flung
herself
into
a
chair
but
do
ask
me
why
for
i
refuse
to
tell
you
now
do
we
dress
for
party
before
dinner
or
after
before
please
said
berry
who
had
followed
the
girls
to
their
rooms
forbes
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
he
wants
an
interview
in
the
before
you
go
to
muriel
and
so
you
better
be
dressed
ah
those
interviews
exclaimed
bernice
how
they
frightened
me
at
first
then
they
rather
bored
me
but
in
the
last
few
days
i
come
to
like
them
so
have
i
said
dotty
i
like
forbes
himself
a
whole
lot
better
than
i
did
at
first
he
so
much
more
he
ought
to
be
laughed
alicia
with
four
girls
to
train
him
up
in
the
way
he
should
go
what
frocks
ladies
our
very
bestest
yes
indeed
said
bernice
this
is
our
last
night
and
we
must
out
in
a
blaze
of
glory
and
scoot
you
two
d
we
none
too
much
time
to
dress
dolly
and
dotty
went
to
their
room
and
it
was
rather
a
silent
dolly
who
sat
down
to
the
to
brush
her
golden
locks
whatamatter
dollums
said
her
chum
sad
at
thoughts
of
going
home
oh
no
really
dot
i
glad
to
go
home
we
had
a
magnificent
time
here
but
i
well
i
i
homesick
so
i
a
little
now
that
you
mention
it
but
we
enough
to
remember
and
think
over
for
a
long
time
have
we
of
course
my
but
i
glad
that
earring
was
found
oh
dot
it
have
been
awful
if
we
had
gone
home
with
that
doubt
hanging
over
us
it
would
indeed
old
girl
and
now
if
you
proceed
to
do
up
that
mass
on
top
of
your
head
i
accept
the
dressing
mirror
for
a
while
dolly
twisted
up
her
golden
mop
and
decorated
it
with
a
ribbon
band
and
then
gave
over
her
place
to
dotty
and
shortly
four
very
much
girls
went
down
to
the
extra
elaborate
dinner
that
was
served
in
honour
of
the
last
night
of
their
visit
the
chat
at
table
was
far
more
gay
and
spontaneous
than
it
had
been
on
the
night
of
their
arrival
for
all
had
become
used
to
each
ways
and
had
grown
to
like
each
other
very
much
forbes
too
had
changed
from
a
stiff
somewhat
embarrassed
host
to
a
genial
even
gay
comrade
he
asked
all
about
their
doings
of
the
day
and
they
told
him
with
gay
stories
of
funny
episodes
dolly
watched
alicia
but
except
that
her
eyes
were
unusually
bright
and
her
laughter
very
frequent
the
western
girl
showed
no
especial
excitement
after
dinner
they
all
went
to
the
and
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
real
sadness
that
dolly
realised
it
was
for
the
last
time
forbes
walked
up
and
down
the
room
as
he
often
did
and
then
paused
in
front
of
the
group
of
girls
who
were
standing
by
the
piano
sit
down
girlies
he
said
alicia
and
bernice
sit
on
that
sofa
please
you
two
d
on
that
one
uncle
jeff
was
smiling
but
still
there
seemed
to
be
an
undercurrent
of
seriousness
in
his
tone
that
implied
a
special
talk
did
it
ever
occur
to
any
of
you
he
began
that
i
invited
you
here
for
something
beside
a
mere
desire
to
give
you
young
people
some
pleasure
why
you
practically
said
so
to
us
uncle
jeff
laughed
alicia
are
you
going
to
tell
us
your
reason
yes
i
am
and
i
going
to
tell
you
now
forbes
sat
down
in
an
easy
chair
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
look
straight
at
all
the
girls
but
his
gaze
rested
on
his
two
nieces
my
reason
he
said
slowly
is
i
admit
a
selfish
one
if
you
girls
have
enjoyed
your
visit
i
very
glad
but
what
i
wanted
was
to
study
you
i
knew
it
exclaimed
bernice
i
thought
you
were
studying
us
our
characters
yes
just
that
and
i
wanted
to
study
the
characters
of
my
two
nieces
now
you
know
you
ca
judge
much
of
girls
unless
you
see
them
with
their
comrades
their
chums
or
at
least
with
other
girls
of
their
own
age
so
i
asked
you
each
to
bring
a
girl
friend
with
you
as
it
happened
bernie
brought
two
and
alicia
none
but
that
did
matter
and
i
exceedingly
glad
to
have
met
and
known
the
two
d
the
courteous
old
gentleman
bowed
to
dotty
and
dolly
who
smiled
and
bowed
in
return
well
uncle
jeff
went
on
here
the
reason
i
wanted
to
study
my
two
nieces
because
i
want
to
take
one
of
them
to
live
with
me
and
to
inherit
eventually
my
house
and
the
greater
part
of
my
fortune
there
was
a
silence
as
each
of
his
hearers
thought
over
what
this
would
mean
either
bernice
or
alicia
was
to
be
chosen
to
live
in
that
big
city
house
practically
to
be
mistress
of
it
to
have
a
life
of
wealth
and
luxury
and
at
last
to
inherit
forbes
great
fortune
and
all
his
valuable
collections
and
belongings
dotty
broke
the
silence
it
great
she
exclaimed
just
great
and
which
one
are
you
going
to
choose
i
have
chosen
said
forbes
slowly
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
the
one
i
have
selected
will
accept
but
now
you
all
can
see
why
i
was
so
alarmed
and
anxious
over
the
episode
of
the
lost
earring
i
had
to
find
out
if
any
of
you
girls
had
yielded
to
temptation
and
if
so
if
it
was
one
of
my
nieces
or
one
of
their
friends
and
if
it
had
been
one
of
your
nieces
you
would
have
chosen
the
other
cried
bernice
no
my
child
returned
her
uncle
quite
the
contrary
if
either
you
or
alicia
had
taken
that
gem
with
a
wrong
intent
i
should
have
asked
the
to
come
and
live
with
me
hoping
i
could
teach
her
the
error
of
her
ways
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
for
none
of
you
did
take
the
jewel
nor
indeed
ever
thought
of
such
a
thing
but
my
decision
which
i
have
made
is
not
entirely
based
on
worthiness
or
even
on
desirability
and
i
tell
you
frankly
had
i
tried
to
choose
my
favourite
between
bernie
and
i
should
have
had
a
hard
time
for
i
have
come
to
love
both
girls
very
dearly
and
would
have
not
the
slightest
objection
to
adopting
them
both
and
us
two
also
asked
dotty
mischievously
yes
and
you
two
also
bless
my
soul
from
a
lonely
somewhat
misanthropic
old
man
you
young
people
have
turned
me
into
a
real
human
being
i
like
young
voices
round
me
and
young
folks
pleasures
going
on
in
my
house
well
my
dears
are
you
interested
to
know
my
choice
are
we
cried
dotty
while
dolly
fairly
held
her
breath
i
have
chosen
alicia
forbes
announced
and
there
was
a
deep
silence
bernice
looked
a
little
bewildered
but
not
at
all
disappointed
alicia
looked
simply
stunned
and
the
two
d
just
listened
for
further
developments
but
do
you
for
one
minute
think
said
forbes
that
i
consider
alicia
in
any
way
superior
to
bernice
nor
on
the
other
hand
do
i
think
bernie
better
than
alicia
i
love
my
nieces
equally
and
the
thing
that
settled
the
question
in
my
mind
was
a
letter
i
received
from
alicia
father
i
know
cried
alicia
i
had
one
too
i
did
say
anything
about
it
because
dad
asked
me
not
to
you
tell
uncle
jeff
it
this
said
forbes
alicia
father
is
to
be
married
soon
as
you
know
alicia
mother
my
dear
sister
died
many
years
ago
and
i
know
steele
but
slightly
however
now
that
he
is
about
to
remarry
i
hope
that
it
will
please
both
him
and
his
new
wife
if
alicia
comes
to
live
with
me
also
i
hope
it
will
please
alicia
oh
uncle
jeff
and
alicia
flew
over
to
him
and
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
indeed
it
does
please
me
why
only
i
was
saying
how
i
love
to
live
in
new
york
and
how
i
hated
to
go
back
to
that
old
school
but
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
as
this
oh
it
just
fine
exclaimed
bernice
i
could
think
of
leaving
father
and
i
rather
live
in
the
country
anyhow
i
discovered
that
bernie
girl
said
her
uncle
seriously
why
i
had
you
girls
here
so
i
could
see
for
myself
what
your
tastes
and
traits
really
are
i
learned
that
bernice
prefers
her
own
home
and
too
that
she
does
want
to
leave
her
father
alone
though
my
plan
would
have
been
if
i
asked
bernice
to
come
here
to
have
her
father
live
here
too
however
i
also
discovered
that
alicia
is
unhappy
in
her
school
life
that
she
does
not
care
much
about
returning
to
her
western
home
to
live
with
a
stepmother
and
that
she
adores
new
york
city
so
i
wrote
to
her
father
asking
his
opinion
and
he
leaves
the
settlement
of
the
question
to
alicia
herself
and
i
settle
it
yes
oh
i
certainly
do
and
the
girl
gave
her
kind
uncle
another
big
embrace
is
it
funny
you
should
have
been
saying
that
perhaps
you
might
live
in
new
york
said
bernice
yes
replied
alicia
and
her
face
changed
but
i
did
mean
this
dolly
spoke
impulsively
in
fact
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
keep
still
suppose
you
tell
your
uncle
just
what
you
did
mean
she
said
looking
straight
at
alicia
with
an
unmistakably
meaning
gaze
alicia
turned
on
her
with
a
sudden
expression
of
anger
you
did
read
that
note
in
my
coat
pocket
she
cried
you
did
read
it
dolly
fayre
and
you
pretended
you
were
too
honourable
to
do
such
a
thing
why
alicia
i
did
not
you
take
that
back
bless
my
soul
are
you
two
quarrelling
what
is
the
matter
dolly
read
my
note
cried
alicia
she
i
did
not
interrupted
dolly
her
blue
eyes
blazing
alicia
has
a
secret
and
i
think
she
ought
to
tell
it
i
got
a
right
to
have
a
secret
if
i
like
dolly
fayre
but
it
is
a
nice
secret
you
would
want
uncle
forbes
to
know
it
it
it
shocking
how
do
you
know
i
know
all
about
it
at
least
i
know
something
about
it
i
heard
you
and
marly
turner
oh
pshaw
you
little
goose
you
only
think
it
shocking
because
you
so
prim
and
i
tell
uncle
jeff
myself
and
i
tell
him
right
now
all
right
alicia
and
dolly
drew
a
big
sigh
of
relief
if
alicia
would
tell
her
own
secret
it
would
take
all
responsibility
from
her
shoulders
but
alicia
hesitated
she
began
to
speak
once
or
twice
and
stammered
and
paused
at
last
she
said
i
hate
to
tell
it
sounds
so
so
and
ambitious
i
should
think
it
did
cried
dolly
who
began
to
wonder
if
alicia
were
crazy
you
tell
him
dolly
and
alicia
suddenly
looked
very
shy
and
embarrassed
do
you
mean
it
do
you
want
me
to
tell
him
yes
i
honestly
wish
you
would
though
how
you
found
out
about
it
i
do
see
we
were
intending
to
listen
alicia
but
geordie
knapp
and
i
heard
you
and
marly
turner
in
the
little
last
night
oh
that
explains
it
yes
we
did
talk
pretty
loud
well
what
did
you
think
of
it
dolly
if
you
say
so
i
tell
the
rest
and
see
what
they
think
of
it
all
right
go
ahead
spare
my
blushes
good
people
but
i
am
fearfully
embarrassed
everybody
looked
uncomprehending
and
dolly
began
she
could
see
how
alicia
could
treat
the
matter
so
lightly
but
was
fervently
thankful
that
she
did
so
it
this
said
dolly
solemnly
alicia
is
planning
to
elope
with
marly
turner
there
were
four
astonished
faces
that
greeted
this
announcement
but
none
showed
such
blank
amazement
as
alicia
own
oh
dolly
she
cried
oh
dolly
fayre
you
will
be
the
death
of
me
yet
go
on
tell
them
more
that
about
all
i
know
they
planned
it
last
night
and
it
just
happened
that
geordie
and
i
heard
them
marly
coaxed
her
and
alicia
hesitated
and
then
consented
she
said
her
mother
eloped
and
she
would
do
the
same
they
were
going
to
have
a
rope
ladder
oh
dolly
oh
uncle
jeff
oh
dollyrinda
well
alicia
suppose
you
stop
yelling
oh
and
tell
me
about
this
interesting
performance
forbes
spoke
severely
but
alicia
had
thrown
herself
into
a
big
chair
and
was
screaming
with
laughter
every
time
she
essayed
to
speak
she
went
off
in
uncontrollable
spasms
of
mirth
and
when
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
endeavoured
to
speak
she
giggled
again
dolly
realised
there
was
some
misunderstanding
somewhere
and
waited
for
the
explanation
at
last
it
came
no
uncle
jeff
and
alicia
managed
to
speak
intelligibly
i
not
going
to
elope
with
marly
or
anybody
else
i
going
to
live
here
with
you
but
you
were
said
dolly
you
planned
to
no
my
child
and
alicia
laughed
again
i
have
to
tell
my
story
myself
i
written
a
play
uncle
and
in
it
the
heroine
elopes
with
the
handsome
hero
i
was
awfully
shy
about
showing
it
to
anybody
but
marly
said
he
try
to
persuade
his
father
to
read
it
over
and
see
if
it
showed
any
promise
you
know
it
a
great
thing
to
have
turner
read
your
play
and
i
was
delighted
well
last
night
marly
and
i
went
over
the
elopement
scene
that
the
strong
act
of
the
play
and
what
dolly
heard
and
she
thought
we
were
talking
ourselves
oh
dolly
if
people
plan
to
elope
they
do
do
it
at
the
top
of
their
lungs
marly
and
i
read
the
various
character
parts
to
see
how
it
would
sound
in
different
voices
well
then
he
said
he
try
to
get
his
father
to
read
it
so
i
know
before
i
went
away
and
he
telephoned
that
he
pull
it
off
he
meant
he
get
his
father
to
read
it
that
my
secret
and
you
know
uncle
jeff
my
mother
did
elope
because
her
father
did
want
her
to
marry
jim
steele
and
i
heard
the
story
of
her
elopement
so
often
and
it
was
so
dramatic
that
i
put
it
in
my
play
oh
dolly
what
a
little
innocent
you
are
i
do
care
if
i
am
returned
dolly
and
her
pretty
face
beamed
with
smiles
i
think
your
secret
is
lovely
alicia
and
i
think
uncle
forbes
secret
is
too
so
do
i
said
dotty
and
i
glad
and
proud
that
dollyrinda
and
i
are
chums
of
two
such
talented
and
distinguished
girls
and
glad
alicia
said
her
uncle
that
you
have
a
taste
for
writing
i
shall
be
glad
to
help
you
cultivate
it
and
i
no
doubt
that
turner
can
give
you
valuable
advice
of
course
your
early
efforts
ca
amount
to
much
but
if
you
care
to
keep
at
it
you
may
yet
do
good
work
well
then
do
i
understand
that
you

her
funny
mistake

for
thinking

read
my
note
in
it
marly

manuscript

i
was
so
excited
over
it
but
