dinner
was
just
over
and
the
company
were
moving
into
the
hurrying
to
the
fireplace
the
marquise
de
langrune
took
a
large
log
from
a
basket
and
flung
it
on
to
the
glowing
embers
on
the
hearth
the
log
crackled
and
shed
a
brilliant
light
over
the
whole
room
the
guests
of
the
marquise
instinctively
drew
near
to
the
fire
during
the
ten
consecutive
months
she
spent
every
year
at
her
château
of
beaulieu
on
the
outskirts
of
corrèze
that
picturesque
district
bounded
by
the
dordogne
it
had
been
the
immemorial
custom
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
to
entertain
a
few
of
her
personal
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
to
dinner
every
wednesday
thereby
obtaining
a
little
pleasant
relief
from
her
loneliness
and
keeping
up
some
contact
with
the
world
on
this
particular
winter
evening
the
good
lady
guests
included
several
habitués
president
bonnet
a
retired
magistrate
who
had
withdrawn
to
his
small
property
at
in
the
suburbs
of
brives
and
the
abbé
sicot
who
was
the
parish
priest
a
more
occasional
friend
was
also
there
the
baronne
de
vibray
a
young
and
wealthy
widow
a
typical
woman
of
the
world
who
spent
the
greater
part
of
her
life
either
in
motoring
or
in
the
most
exclusive
of
paris
or
at
the
most
fashionable
but
when
the
baronne
de
vibray
put
herself
out
to
grass
as
she
racily
phrased
it
and
spent
a
few
weeks
at
querelles
her
estate
close
to
the
château
of
beaulieu
nothing
pleased
her
better
than
to
take
her
place
again
in
the
delightful
company
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
and
her
friends
finally
youth
was
represented
by
charles
rambert
who
had
arrived
at
the
château
a
couple
of
days
before
a
charming
lad
of
about
eighteen
who
was
treated
with
warm
affection
by
the
marquise
and
by
thérèse
auvernois
the
granddaughter
of
the
marquise
with
whom
since
her
parents
death
she
had
lived
as
a
daughter
the
odd
and
even
mysterious
words
spoken
by
president
bonnet
as
they
were
leaving
the
table
and
the
personality
of
this
fantômas
about
which
he
had
said
nothing
definite
in
spite
of
all
the
questions
put
to
him
had
excited
the
curiosity
of
the
company
and
while
thérèse
auvernois
was
gracefully
dispensing
the
coffee
to
her
grandmother
guests
the
questions
were
renewed
with
greater
insistence
crowding
round
the
fire
for
the
evening
was
very
cold
mme
de
langrune
friends
showered
fresh
questions
upon
the
old
magistrate
who
secretly
enjoyed
the
interest
he
had
inspired
he
cast
a
solemn
eye
upon
the
circle
of
his
audience
and
prolonged
his
silence
the
more
to
capture
their
attention
at
length
he
began
to
speak
statistics
tell
us
ladies
that
of
all
the
deaths
that
are
registered
every
day
quite
a
third
are
due
to
crime
you
are
no
doubt
aware
that
the
police
discover
about
half
of
the
crimes
that
are
committed
and
that
barely
half
meet
with
the
penalty
of
justice
this
explains
how
it
is
that
so
many
mysteries
are
never
cleared
up
and
why
there
are
so
many
mistakes
and
inconsistencies
in
judicial
investigations
what
is
the
conclusion
you
wish
to
draw
the
marquise
de
langrune
enquired
with
interest
this
the
magistrate
proceeded
although
many
crimes
pass
unsuspected
it
is
none
the
less
obvious
that
they
have
been
committed
now
while
some
of
them
are
due
to
ordinary
criminals
others
are
the
work
of
enigmatical
beings
who
are
difficult
to
trace
and
too
clever
or
intelligent
to
let
themselves
be
caught
history
is
full
of
stories
of
such
mysterious
characters
the
iron
mask
for
instance
and
cagliostro
in
every
age
there
have
been
bands
of
dangerous
creatures
led
by
such
men
as
cartouche
and
vidocq
and
rocambole
now
why
should
we
suppose
that
in
our
time
no
one
exists
who
emulates
the
deeds
of
those
mighty
criminals
the
abbé
sicot
raised
a
gentle
voice
from
the
depths
of
a
comfortable
wherein
he
was
peacefully
digesting
his
dinner
the
police
do
their
work
better
in
our
time
than
ever
they
did
before
that
is
perfectly
true
the
president
admitted
but
their
work
is
also
more
difficult
than
ever
it
was
before
criminals
who
operate
in
the
grand
manner
have
all
sorts
of
things
at
their
disposal
nowadays
science
has
done
much
for
modern
progress
but
unfortunately
it
can
be
of
invaluable
assistance
to
criminals
at
times
the
hosts
of
evil
have
the
telegraph
and
the
at
their
disposal
just
as
authority
has
and
some
day
they
will
make
use
of
the
aeroplane
young
charles
rambert
had
been
listening
to
the
president
dissertation
with
the
utmost
interest
and
now
broke
in
with
a
voice
that
quivered
slightly
you
were
talking
about
fantômas
just
now
sir
the
president
cast
a
cryptic
look
at
the
lad
and
did
not
reply
directly
to
him
that
is
what
i
am
coming
to
for
of
course
you
have
understood
me
ladies
in
these
days
we
have
been
distressed
by
a
steady
access
of
criminality
and
among
the
assets
we
shall
henceforth
have
to
count
a
mysterious
and
most
dangerous
creature
to
whom
the
baffled
authorities
and
public
rumour
generally
have
for
some
time
now
given
the
name
of
fantômas
it
is
impossible
to
say
exactly
or
to
know
precisely
who
fantômas
is
he
often
assumes
the
form
and
personality
of
some
definite
and
even
individual
sometimes
he
assumes
the
forms
of
two
human
beings
at
one
and
the
same
time
sometimes
he
works
alone
sometimes
with
accomplices
sometimes
he
can
be
identified
as
such
and
such
a
person
but
no
one
has
ever
yet
arrived
at
knowing
fantômas
himself
that
he
is
a
living
person
is
certain
and
undeniable
yet
he
is
impossible
to
catch
or
to
identify
he
is
nowhere
and
everywhere
at
once
his
shadow
hovers
above
the
strangest
mysteries
and
his
traces
are
found
near
the
most
inexplicable
crimes
and
yet
you
are
frightening
us
exclaimed
the
baronne
de
vibray
with
a
little
forced
laugh
that
did
not
ring
true
and
the
marquise
de
langrune
who
for
the
past
few
minutes
had
been
uneasy
at
the
idea
of
the
children
listening
to
the
conversation
cast
about
in
her
mind
for
an
occupation
more
suited
to
their
age
the
interruption
gave
her
an
opportunity
and
she
turned
to
charles
rambert
and
thérèse
you
must
find
it
very
dull
here
with
all
of
us
people
dears
so
run
away
now
thérèse
she
added
with
a
smile
to
her
granddaughter
who
had
risen
obediently
there
is
a
splendid
new
puzzle
in
the
library
you
ought
to
try
it
with
charles
the
young
fellow
realised
that
he
must
comply
with
the
desire
of
the
marquise
although
the
conversation
interested
him
intensely
but
he
was
too
well
bred
to
betray
his
thoughts
and
the
next
moment
he
was
in
the
adjoining
room
sitting
opposite
the
girl
and
deep
in
the
intricacies
of
the
latest
fashionable
game
the
baronne
de
vibray
brought
the
conversation
back
to
the
subject
of
fantômas
what
connection
is
there
president
between
this
uncanny
creature
and
the
disappearance
of
lord
beltham
of
which
we
were
talking
at
dinner
i
should
certainly
have
agreed
with
you
and
thought
there
was
none
the
old
magistrate
replied
if
lord
beltham
disappearance
had
been
unattended
by
any
mysterious
circumstance
but
there
is
one
point
that
deserves
your
attention
the
newspaper
from
which
i
read
an
extract
just
now
draws
attention
to
it
and
regards
it
as
being
important
it
is
said
that
when
lady
beltham
began
to
be
uneasy
about
her
husband
absence
on
the
morning
of
the
day
following
his
disappearance
she
remembered
noticing
just
as
he
was
going
out
that
he
was
reading
a
particular
letter
the
peculiar
square
shape
of
which
surprised
her
she
had
also
noticed
that
the
handwriting
of
the
letter
was
very
heavy
and
black
now
she
found
the
letter
in
question
upon
her
husband
desk
but
the
whole
of
the
writing
had
disappeared
and
it
was
only
the
most
minute
examination
that
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
a
few
almost
imperceptible
stains
which
proved
that
it
really
was
the
identical
document
that
had
been
in
her
husband
hands
lady
beltham
would
not
have
thought
very
much
about
it
if
it
had
not
occurred
to
the
editor
of
to
interview
detective
juve
about
it
the
famous
inspector
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
you
know
who
has
brought
so
many
notorious
criminals
to
justice
now
juve
manifested
the
greatest
excitement
over
the
discovery
and
the
nature
of
this
document
and
he
did
not
attempt
to
hide
from
his
interviewer
his
belief
that
the
strange
nature
of
this
unusual
epistle
was
proof
of
the
intervention
of
fantômas
you
very
likely
know
that
juve
has
made
it
his
special
business
to
follow
up
fantômas
he
has
sworn
that
he
will
take
him
and
he
is
after
him
body
and
soul
let
us
hope
he
will
succeed
but
it
is
no
good
pretending
that
juve
job
is
not
as
difficult
a
one
as
can
be
imagined
however
it
is
a
fair
inference
that
when
juve
spoke
as
he
did
to
the
representative
of
he
did
not
think
he
was
going
too
far
when
he
declared
that
a
crime
lay
behind
the
disappearance
of
lord
beltham
and
that
perhaps
the
crime
must
be
laid
at
fantômas
door
and
we
can
only
hope
that
at
some
not
distant
date
justice
will
not
only
throw
full
light
upon
this
mysterious
affair
but
also
rid
us
for
ever
of
this
terrifying
criminal
president
bonnet
had
convinced
his
audience
completely
and
his
closing
words
cast
a
chill
upon
them
all
the
marquise
de
langrune
deemed
it
time
to
create
a
diversion
who
are
these
people
lord
and
lady
beltham
she
enquired
oh
my
dear
the
baronne
de
vibray
answered
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
you
lead
the
life
of
a
hermit
in
this
remote
country
home
of
yours
and
that
echoes
from
the
world
of
paris
do
not
reach
you
often
lord
and
lady
beltham
are
among
the
best
known
and
most
popular
people
in
society
he
was
formerly
attached
to
the
english
embassy
but
left
paris
to
fight
in
the
transvaal
and
his
wife
went
with
him
and
showed
magnificent
courage
and
compassion
in
charge
of
the
ambulance
and
hospital
work
they
then
went
back
to
london
and
a
couple
of
years
ago
they
settled
once
more
in
paris
they
lived
and
still
live
in
the
boulevard
inkermann
at
in
a
delightful
house
where
they
entertain
a
great
deal
i
have
often
been
one
of
lady
guests
she
is
a
most
fascinating
woman
distinguished
tall
fair
and
endowed
with
the
charm
that
is
peculiar
to
the
women
of
the
north
i
am
very
distressed
at
the
trouble
that
is
hanging
over
her
well
said
the
marquise
de
langrune
conclusively
i
mean
to
believe
that
the
gloomy
prognostications
of
our
friend
the
president
will
not
be
justified
by
the
event
amen
murmured
the
abbé
mechanically
roused
from
his
gentle
slumber
by
the
closing
words
of
the
marquise
the
clock
chimed
ten
and
her
duties
as
hostess
did
not
make
the
marquise
forgetful
of
her
duties
as
grandmother
thérèse
she
called
it
is
your
it
is
very
late
darling
the
child
obediently
left
her
game
said
good
night
to
the
baronne
de
vibray
and
president
bonnet
and
last
of
all
to
the
old
priest
who
gave
her
a
paternal
embrace
shall
i
see
you
at
the
seven
mass
thérèse
he
asked
the
child
turned
to
the
marquise
will
you
let
me
accompany
charles
to
the
station
morning
i
will
go
to
the
eight
mass
on
my
way
back
the
marquise
looked
at
charles
rambert
your
father
really
is
coming
by
the
train
that
reaches
verrières
at
and
when
he
assented
she
hesitated
a
moment
before
replying
to
thérèse
i
think
dear
it
would
be
better
to
let
our
young
friend
go
alone
to
meet
his
father
but
charles
rambert
put
in
his
plea
oh
i
am
sure
my
father
would
be
delighted
to
see
thérèse
with
me
when
he
gets
out
of
the
train
very
well
then
the
kind
old
lady
said
arrange
it
as
you
please
but
thérèse
before
you
go
upstairs
tell
our
good
steward
dollon
to
give
orders
for
the
carriage
to
be
ready
by
six
it
is
a
long
way
to
the
station
thérèse
promised
and
the
two
young
people
left
the
a
pretty
couple
remarked
the
baronne
de
vibray
adding
with
a
characteristic
touch
of
malice
you
mean
to
make
a
match
between
them
some
day
marquise
the
old
lady
threw
up
her
hands
protesting
what
an
idea
why
thérèse
is
not
fifteen
yet
who
is
this
charles
rambert
the
abbé
asked
i
just
caught
sight
of
him
the
day
before
yesterday
with
dollon
and
i
puzzled
my
brains
wondering
who
he
could
be
i
am
not
surprised
the
marquise
laughed
not
surprised
that
you
did
not
succeed
in
finding
out
for
you
do
not
know
him
but
you
may
perhaps
have
heard
me
mention
a
etienne
rambert
an
old
friend
of
mine
with
whom
i
had
many
a
dance
in
the
long
ago
i
had
lost
sight
of
him
completely
until
about
two
years
ago
when
i
met
him
at
a
charity
function
in
paris
the
poor
man
has
had
a
rather
chequered
life
twenty
years
ago
he
married
a
woman
who
was
perfectly
charming
but
who
is
i
believe
very
ill
with
a
distressing
malady
i
am
not
even
sure
that
she
is
not
insane
quite
lately
etienne
rambert
has
been
compelled
to
send
her
to
an
asylum
that
does
not
tell
us
how
his
son
comes
to
be
your
guest
president
bonnet
urged
it
is
very
simple
etienne
rambert
is
an
energetic
man
who
is
always
moving
about
although
he
is
quite
sixty
he
still
occupies
himself
with
some
rubber
plantations
he
possesses
in
colombia
and
he
often
goes
to
america
he
thinks
no
more
of
the
voyage
than
we
do
of
a
trip
to
paris
well
just
recently
young
charles
rambert
was
leaving
the
in
hamburg
where
he
had
been
living
in
order
to
perfect
his
german
i
knew
from
his
father
letters
that
mme
rambert
was
about
to
be
put
away
and
that
etienne
rambert
was
obliged
to
be
absent
so
i
offered
to
receive
charles
here
until
his
father
should
return
to
paris
charles
came
the
day
before
yesterday
and
that
is
the
whole
story
and
etienne
rambert
joins
him
here
said
the
abbé
that
is
so
the
marquise
de
langrune
would
have
given
other
information
about
her
young
friend
had
he
not
come
into
the
room
just
then
he
was
an
attractive
lad
with
refined
and
distinguished
features
clear
intelligent
eyes
and
graceful
figure
the
other
guests
were
silent
and
charles
rambert
approached
them
with
the
slight
awkwardness
of
youth
he
went
up
to
president
bonnet
and
plucked
up
sudden
courage
and
what
then
sir
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
i
do
understand
my
boy
said
the
magistrate
oh
said
charles
rambert
have
you
finished
talking
about
fantômas
it
was
so
amusing
for
my
part
the
president
answered
dryly
i
do
not
find
these
stories
about
criminals
but
the
lad
did
not
detect
the
shade
of
reproach
in
the
words
but
still
it
is
very
odd
very
extraordinary
that
such
mysterious
characters
as
fantômas
can
exist
nowadays
is
it
really
possible
that
a
single
man
can
commit
such
a
number
of
crimes
and
that
any
human
being
can
escape
discovery
as
they
say
fantômas
can
and
be
able
to
foil
the
cleverest
devices
of
the
police
i
think
it
is
the
president
manner
grew
steadily
more
chilly
as
the
boy
curiosity
waxed
more
enthusiastic
and
he
interrupted
curtly
i
fail
to
understand
your
attitude
young
man
you
appear
to
be
hypnotised
fascinated
you
speak
of
fantômas
as
if
he
were
something
interesting
it
is
out
of
place
to
put
it
mildly
and
he
turned
to
the
abbé
sicot
there
sir
that
is
the
result
of
this
modern
education
and
the
state
of
mind
produced
in
the
younger
generation
by
the
newspaper
press
and
even
by
literature
criminals
are
given
haloes
and
proclaimed
from
the
housetops
it
is
astounding
but
charles
rambert
was
not
the
least
impressed
but
it
is
life
sir
it
is
history
it
is
the
real
thing
he
insisted
why
you
yourself
in
just
a
few
words
have
thrown
an
atmosphere
round
this
fantômas
which
makes
him
absolutely
fascinating
i
would
give
anything
to
have
known
vidocq
and
cartouche
and
rocambole
and
to
have
seen
them
at
close
quarters
those
were
men
president
bonnet
contemplated
the
young
man
in
astonishment
his
eyes
flashed
lightning
at
him
and
he
burst
out
you
are
mad
boy
absolutely
mad
vidocq
rocambole
you
mix
up
legend
and
history
bracket
murderers
with
detectives
and
make
no
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
you
would
not
hesitate
to
set
the
heroes
of
crime
and
the
heroes
of
law
and
order
on
one
and
the
same
pedestal
you
have
said
the
word
sir
charles
rambert
exclaimed
they
all
are
heroes
but
better
still
fantômas
the
lad
outburst
was
so
vehement
and
spontaneous
and
sincere
that
it
provoked
unanimous
indignation
among
his
hearers
even
the
indulgent
marquise
de
langrune
ceased
to
smile
charles
rambert
perceived
that
he
had
gone
too
far
and
stopped
abruptly
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
he
murmured
i
spoke
without
thinking
please
forgive
me
he
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
at
president
bonnet
blushing
to
the
tips
of
his
ears
and
looking
so
abashed
that
the
magistrate
who
was
a
man
at
bottom
tried
to
reassure
him
your
imagination
is
much
too
lively
young
man
much
too
lively
but
you
will
grow
out
of
that
come
come
that
all
right
lads
of
your
age
do
talk
without
knowledge
it
was
very
late
now
and
a
few
minutes
after
this
incident
the
guests
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
took
their
departure
charles
rambert
accompanied
the
marquise
to
the
door
of
her
own
private
rooms
and
was
about
to
bid
her
a
respectful
good
night
before
going
on
to
his
bedroom
which
adjoined
hers
when
she
asked
him
to
follow
her
come
in
and
get
the
book
i
promised
you
charles
it
should
be
on
my
she
glanced
at
that
piece
of
furniture
as
she
entered
the
room
and
went
on
or
in
it
perhaps
i
may
have
locked
it
away
i
do
want
to
give
you
any
trouble
he
protested
but
the
marquise
insisted
put
your
light
down
on
that
table
she
said
besides
i
have
got
to
open
my
desk
for
i
must
look
at
the
lottery
tickets
i
gave
to
thérèse
a
few
weeks
ago
she
pushed
back
the
roll
top
of
her
empire
desk
and
looked
up
at
the
young
fellow
it
would
be
a
piece
of
good
luck
if
my
little
thérèse
won
the
first
prize
eh
charles
a
million
francs
that
would
be
worth
winning
rather
said
charles
rambert
with
a
smile
the
marquise
found
the
book
she
was
searching
for
and
gave
it
to
the
lad
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
she
smoothed
out
several
variegated
papers
these
are
my
tickets
she
said
and
then
broke
off
how
stupid
of
me
i
have
not
kept
the
number
of
the
winning
ticket
that
was
advertised
in
charles
rambert
immediately
offered
to
go
downstairs
again
to
fetch
the
newspaper
but
the
marquise
would
not
let
him
it
is
no
good
my
dear
boy
it
is
not
there
now
you
know
or
rather
you
do
know
that
the
abbé
takes
away
all
the
week
newspapers
every
wednesday
night
in
order
to
read
all
the
political
articles
the
old
lady
turned
away
from
her
which
she
left
wide
open
conducted
the
young
man
to
the
door
and
held
out
a
friendly
hand
it
is
morning
already
she
said
so
now
good
night
dear
charles
in
his
own
room
with
the
lights
extinguished
and
the
curtains
closed
charles
rambert
lay
wide
awake
a
prey
to
strange
excitement
he
turned
and
tossed
in
his
bed
nervously
in
vain
did
he
try
to
banish
from
his
mind
the
words
spoken
during
the
evening
by
president
bonnet
in
imagination
charles
rambert
saw
all
manner
of
sinister
and
dramatic
scenes
crimes
and
murders
hugely
interested
intensely
curious
craving
for
knowledge
he
was
ever
trying
to
concoct
plots
and
unravel
mysteries
if
for
an
instant
he
dozed
off
the
image
of
fantômas
took
shape
in
his
mind
but
never
twice
the
same
sometimes
he
saw
a
colossal
figure
with
bestial
face
and
muscular
shoulders
sometimes
a
wan
thin
creature
with
strange
and
piercing
eyes
sometimes
a
vague
form
a
phantom
fantômas
charles
rambert
slept
and
woke
and
dozed
again
in
the
silence
of
the
night
he
thought
he
heard
creakings
and
heavy
sounds
then
suddenly
he
felt
a
breath
pass
over
his
face
and
again
nothing
and
suddenly
again
strange
sounds
were
buzzing
in
his
ears
bathed
in
cold
sweat
charles
rambert
started
and
sat
upright
in
bed
every
muscle
tense
listening
with
all
his
ears
was
he
dreaming
or
had
he
really
waked
up
he
did
not
know
and
still
still
he
had
a
consciousness
of
fantômas
of
mystery
of
fantômas
charles
rambert
heard
the
clock
strike
four
ii
a
tragic
dawn
as
his
cab
turned
by
the
end
of
the
pont
royal
towards
the
gare
etienne
rambert
looked
at
his
watch
and
found
as
he
had
anticipated
that
he
had
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
train
that
he
intended
to
take
was
due
to
start
he
called
a
porter
and
gave
him
the
heavy
valise
and
the
bundle
of
rugs
that
formed
the
whole
of
his
hand
baggage
where
is
the
office
for
forwarding
luggage
my
man
he
enquired
the
porter
led
him
through
the
famous
panelled
hall
of
the
gare
and
etienne
rambert
satisfied
himself
that
his
trunks
had
been
properly
registered
for
verrières
the
station
at
which
he
had
to
alight
for
the
château
of
beaulieu
still
attended
by
the
porter
who
had
conceived
a
respectful
admiration
for
him
in
consequence
of
the
authoritative
tone
in
which
he
demanded
information
from
the
various
railway
servants
and
who
scented
a
probable
munificent
tip
etienne
rambert
proceeded
to
the
and
took
a
ticket
he
spent
a
few
minutes
more
at
the
where
he
selected
an
imposing
collection
of
illustrated
papers
and
then
his
final
preparations
completed
he
turned
once
more
to
the
porter
the
luchon
train
he
said
where
is
it
and
as
the
man
only
made
a
vague
gesture
and
growled
something
wholly
indistinct
he
added
lead
the
way
and
i
will
follow
it
was
now
just
eight
and
the
station
showed
all
the
animation
inseparable
from
the
departure
of
trains
etienne
rambert
hurried
onwards
and
reaching
the
platform
from
which
all
the
lines
begin
was
stayed
by
the
porter
who
was
laden
with
his
baggage
you
want
the
express
sir
no
the
slow
train
my
man
the
porter
showed
some
surprise
but
made
no
remark
do
you
like
the
front
or
the
back
of
the
train
the
back
by
choice
is
it
yes
the
porter
who
had
stopped
a
moment
picked
up
the
heavy
valise
again
then
there
is
any
choice
there
are
only
two
carriages
on
the
slow
train
and
they
are
both
in
the
middle
they
are
corridor
carriages
i
suppose
said
etienne
rambert
yes
sir
there
are
hardly
any
others
on
the
trains
especially
in
the
crowd
etienne
rambert
had
some
difficulty
in
following
the
porter
the
gare
has
little
or
none
of
the
attractiveness
of
the
other
stations
which
can
not
fail
to
have
a
certain
fascination
for
any
imaginative
person
who
thinks
of
the
mystery
attaching
to
all
those
iron
rails
reaching
out
into
the
distance
of
countries
unknown
to
him
it
is
less
noisy
than
the
others
also
for
between
austerlitz
and
orsay
the
traction
is
entirely
electric
and
further
there
is
no
clearly
defined
separation
between
the
main
and
the
suburban
lines
on
the
right
of
the
platform
was
the
train
which
was
to
take
etienne
rambert
beyond
brives
to
verrières
the
slow
train
to
luchon
and
on
the
left
of
the
same
platform
was
another
train
for
juvisy
and
all
the
small
stations
in
the
suburbs
of
paris
very
few
people
were
making
for
the
train
to
luchon
but
a
large
crowd
was
pressing
into
the
suburban
train
the
porter
who
was
piloting
etienne
rambert
set
the
baggage
he
was
carrying
down
on
the
footboard
of
a
carriage
there
is
no
one
for
the
slow
train
yet
sir
if
you
like
to
get
in
first
you
can
choose
your
own
compartment
etienne
rambert
acted
on
the
suggestion
but
he
had
hardly
set
foot
in
the
corridor
before
the
guard
also
scenting
a
generous
tip
came
to
offer
his
services
it
really
is
the
you
want
sir
was
his
first
enquiry
you
are
sure
you
are
not
making
a
mistake
no
etienne
rambert
replied
why
a
great
many
passengers
do
make
a
mistake
the
man
explained
and
confuse
the
with
the
express
as
he
spoke
the
guard
took
the
baggage
from
the
porter
who
had
remained
on
the
platform
and
the
porter
after
being
generously
remunerated
for
his
trouble
by
rambert
hurried
away
to
look
for
other
travellers
the
is
the
express
is
it
rambert
enquired
yes
the
guard
answered
it
runs
right
through
without
stopping
at
all
the
small
stations
as
this
train
does
it
goes
in
front
of
this
one
and
gets
to
luchon
three
hours
earlier
there
it
is
on
the
side
there
and
he
pointed
through
the
window
in
the
door
on
the
far
side
to
another
train
on
the
next
rails
in
which
a
number
of
travellers
were
already
taking
their
seats
if
you
prefer
to
go
by
that
one
sir
he
went
on
there
is
still
time
for
you
to
change
you
are
entitled
to
take
your
choice
since
you
have
a
ticket
but
etienne
rambert
after
a
moment
consideration
declined
the
suggestion
no
i
would
rather
go
by
the
slow
train
if
i
take
the
express
i
should
have
to
get
out
at
brives
and
then
i
should
be
twelve
or
thirteen
miles
from
which
is
my
destination
whereas
the
slow
train
stops
at
verrières
where
by
the
way
i
have
already
telegraphed
to
say
i
shall
arrive
morning
he
walked
a
little
way
along
the
corridor
assuring
himself
that
the
various
compartments
were
still
quite
empty
and
then
turned
to
the
guard
look
here
my
man
he
said
i
am
awfully
tired
and
i
mean
to
get
some
sleep
consequently
i
should
like
to
be
alone
now
where
shall
i
be
most
quiet
and
undisturbed
the
man
understood
etienne
rambert
enquiry
about
the
place
where
he
would
be
most
quiet
was
an
implicit
promise
of
a
handsome
tip
if
nobody
did
disturb
him
if
you
like
to
settle
yourself
here
sir
the
man
answered
you
can
draw
down
the
blinds
at
once
and
i
dare
say
i
shall
be
able
to
find
room
for
any
other
passengers
somewhere
else
good
said
rambert
moving
towards
the
compartment
indicated
i
will
smoke
a
cigar
until
the
train
starts
and
immediately
afterwards
i
will
settle
down
to
sleep
by
the
way
my
man
since
you
seem
so
obliging
i
wish
you
would
undertake
to
call
me
morning
in
time
for
me
to
get
out
at
verrières
i
am
desperately
sleepy
and
i
am
quite
capable
of
not
waking
up
the
guard
touched
his
cap
you
can
be
perfectly
easy
sir
and
sleep
without
the
least
anxiety
i
wo
fail
very
well
when
his
baggage
had
been
stowed
away
and
his
rugs
spread
out
to
make
the
seat
more
comfortable
still
etienne
rambert
repeated
his
appeal
for
he
was
an
old
traveller
and
knew
that
it
does
not
do
to
rely
too
much
upon
the
promises
of
chance
attendants
i
can
rely
upon
you
ca
i
i
may
sleep
as
sound
as
i
like
and
you
will
wake
me
at
verrières
and
the
more
to
assure
himself
that
the
guard
would
execute
his
orders
he
slipped
a
franc
into
his
hand
when
he
was
left
alone
rambert
continued
his
preparations
for
the
night
he
carefully
drew
down
the
blinds
over
the
door
and
over
the
windows
of
the
compartment
that
gave
on
to
the
corridor
and
also
lowered
the
shade
over
the
electric
light
and
then
in
order
to
enjoy
the
last
puffs
at
his
cigar
in
peace
he
opened
the
window
over
the
other
door
and
leant
his
elbows
on
it
watching
the
final
preparations
being
made
by
the
travellers
by
the
express
on
the
other
line
the
departure
of
a
train
is
always
a
picturesque
sight
and
rambert
leant
forward
inquisitively
to
note
how
the
passengers
had
installed
themselves
in
the
two
compartments
which
he
could
see
from
his
coign
of
vantage
there
were
not
many
people
in
the
train
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
brives
and
luchon
line
is
not
much
used
at
this
time
of
year
if
the
number
of
passengers
in
the
express
were
any
criterion
etienne
rambert
might
reasonably
expect
that
he
would
be
the
only
one
in
the
slow
train
but
there
was
not
much
time
for
observations
and
reflections
of
this
kind
on
the
platform
for
the
express
which
he
got
a
glimpse
of
through
the
compartments
people
were
hurrying
up
their
farewells
the
passengers
had
got
into
their
carriages
and
the
friends
who
had
come
to
see
them
off
were
standing
alone
upon
the
platform
there
was
the
sound
of
safety
locks
being
fastened
by
porters
and
the
noise
of
trollies
being
wheeled
along
bearing
articles
for
sale
pillows
rugs
sweets
papers
then
came
the
whistle
of
the
guard
the
shriller
scream
from
the
electric
engine
and
then
slowly
at
first
but
steadily
more
rapidly
as
the
engine
got
up
speed
the
express
moved
along
the
platform
and
plunged
into
the
tunnel
on
the
way
to
austerlitz
meanwhile
the
guard
of
the
slow
train
was
doing
wonders
shamelessly
resolved
to
assure
perfect
quiet
to
his
passenger
he
managed
without
unduly
compromising
himself
but
yet
without
leaving
any
doubt
about
it
in
any
mind
to
insinuate
discreetly
that
rambert
carriage
was
reserved
so
that
that
gentleman
might
count
upon
an
entirely
undisturbed
night
a
few
minutes
after
the
express
had
gone
the
slow
train
drew
out
in
its
turn
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
of
the
underground
tunnel
at
the
château
of
beaulieu
young
charles
rambert
was
just
finishing
dressing
when
a
gentle
tap
sounded
on
the
door
of
his
room
it
is
a
quarter
to
five
charles
get
up
at
once
i
am
awake
already
thérèse
charles
rambert
answered
with
some
pride
i
shall
be
ready
in
two
minutes
what
up
already
the
girl
exclaimed
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
marvellous
i
congratulate
you
i
ready
too
i
will
wait
for
you
in
the
come
down
as
soon
as
you
are
dressed
all
right
the
young
man
answered
he
wasted
no
time
over
his
toilette
the
more
so
because
it
was
none
too
warm
in
his
room
for
at
this
early
hour
it
was
still
quite
dark
and
then
taking
his
light
in
one
hand
he
opened
his
door
carefully
so
as
to
make
no
noise
along
the
landing
and
went
down
the
staircase
to
join
thérèse
in
the
the
girl
was
an
accomplished
housekeeper
already
and
while
waiting
for
the
young
fellow
she
had
got
a
scratch
meal
together
let
us
have
breakfast
quickly
she
suggested
it
is
snowing
this
morning
and
if
you
like
we
might
walk
to
the
station
we
have
plenty
of
time
and
it
will
do
us
good
to
have
a
walk
it
will
warm
us
up
anyhow
charles
rambert
replied
he
was
only
but
he
sat
beside
thérèse
and
did
justice
to
the
preparations
she
had
made
do
you
know
that
it
is
very
wonderful
of
you
to
get
up
so
punctually
mme
de
langrune
granddaughter
remarked
how
did
you
manage
it
last
night
you
were
afraid
you
would
sleep
on
as
usual
it
was
not
much
trouble
for
me
to
wake
up
charles
rambert
answered
i
hardly
closed
an
eye
all
night
but
i
promised
to
come
and
knock
at
your
door
myself
so
you
might
have
slept
without
any
anxiety
that
so
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
thérèse
i
was
regularly
upset
and
excited
by
the
thought
of
papa
arriving
this
morning
they
had
both
finished
breakfast
and
thérèse
got
up
shall
we
start
she
asked
yes
thérèse
opened
the
hall
door
and
the
two
young
people
went
down
the
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
garden
the
girl
had
thrown
a
big
cloak
over
her
shoulders
and
she
inhaled
the
pure
morning
air
with
keen
delight
i
love
going
out
in
the
early
morning
she
declared
well
i
do
like
it
at
all
charles
rambert
confessed
with
characteristic
candour
good
lord
how
cold
it
is
and
it
is
still
pitch
dark
surely
you
are
not
going
to
be
frightened
said
thérèse
teasingly
charles
rambert
made
an
irritable
movement
of
vexation
and
surprise
frightened
what
do
you
take
me
for
thérèse
if
i
do
like
going
out
in
the
early
morning
it
really
only
because
it
is
cold
she
laughed
at
him
while
they
were
crossing
the
lawn
towards
the
through
which
she
meant
to
get
out
on
to
the
high
road
as
they
passed
the
stables
they
came
across
a
groom
who
was
leisurely
getting
an
old
brougham
out
of
the
do
hurry
jean
thérèse
called
out
as
she
greeted
him
we
are
going
to
walk
to
the
station
and
the
only
important
thing
is
that
you
should
be
there
to
bring
us
back
the
man
touched
his
cap
and
the
two
young
people
passed
through
the
park
gate
and
found
themselves
upon
the
high
road
it
was
still
very
dark
with
just
a
wan
reflection
in
the
distance
of
the
sky
vaguely
outlining
some
to
the
eastward
to
give
some
promise
of
the
day
there
was
no
sound
to
break
the
silence
of
the
fields
and
as
they
walked
briskly
along
charles
and
thérèse
could
hear
their
footsteps
ringing
on
the
hard
surface
of
the
frozen
ground
it
must
please
you
awfully
to
be
going
to
meet
your
father
said
mme
de
langrune
granddaughter
half
questioningly
it
is
a
long
time
since
you
have
seen
him
is
it
three
years
charles
rambert
answered
and
then
just
for
a
few
minutes
he
is
coming
home
from
america
now
and
before
that
he
travelled
in
spain
for
a
long
time
he
was
travelling
the
whole
time
you
were
a
child
was
he
yes
always
either
in
colombia
looking
after
his
rubber
plantations
there
or
in
spain
where
he
has
a
good
deal
of
property
too
when
he
was
in
paris
he
used
to
come
to
the
school
and
ask
for
me
and
i
saw
him
in
the
parlour
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
your
mother
oh
mamma
was
different
you
know
thérèse
i
spent
all
the
childhood
that
i
can
remember
at
the
school
i
liked
the
masters
and
had
good
chums
and
was
very
happy
there
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
i
looked
forward
with
anything
but
pleasure
to
the
holidays
when
i
had
to
go
to
my
parents
house
i
always
felt
a
stranger
with
them
my
real
home
was
the
where
i
had
my
desk
and
all
my
own
interests
and
then
you
know
when
one
is
little
one
does
understand
things
much
i
did
feel
having
hardly
any
family
very
much
but
you
loved
your
mother
very
much
thérèse
asked
the
question
quite
anxiously
and
it
was
patent
that
she
would
have
thought
it
dreadful
if
her
companion
had
not
had
a
real
affection
for
his
mother
oh
yes
i
loved
her
charles
rambert
answered
but
i
hardly
knew
her
either
and
as
thérèse
showed
her
surprise
he
went
on
telling
her
something
of
the
secret
of
his
lonely
childhood
you
see
thérèse
now
that
i
am
a
man
i
guess
lots
of
things
that
i
could
not
have
had
even
a
suspicion
of
then
my
father
and
mother
did
not
get
on
well
together
they
were
what
you
call
an
couple
they
were
both
very
good
but
their
characters
did
not
harmonise
when
i
was
little
i
always
saw
mamma
silent
and
sad
and
papa
active
and
on
the
go
and
bright
and
talking
at
the
top
of
his
voice
i
half
believe
he
frightened
mamma
and
then
my
father
was
constantly
away
whereas
mamma
hardly
ever
went
out
when
a
servant
took
me
to
the
house
on
thursdays
i
was
taken
up
to
say
good
morning
to
her
and
i
invariably
found
her
lying
on
a
sofa
in
her
room
with
the
blinds
down
and
almost
dark
she
just
touched
me
with
her
lips
and
asked
me
one
or
two
questions
and
then
i
was
taken
away
again
because
i
tired
her
was
she
ill
then
mamma
always
has
been
ill
i
suppose
you
know
thérèse
that
three
months
ago
stay
it
was
just
when
i
had
taken
my
degree
and
went
to
germany
she
was
sent
to
an
asylum
i
believe
my
father
had
wanted
her
to
agree
to
undergo
careful
treatment
of
the
kind
long
before
but
she
would
not
thérèse
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
you
have
not
been
very
happy
she
said
presently
oh
it
was
only
after
i
grew
up
that
i
felt
unhappy
when
i
was
a
little
chap
i
never
thought
of
how
sad
it
is
to
have
no
real
father
or
mother
the
last
four
or
five
years
it
has
hurt
me
but
when
he
came
to
see
me
once
at
school
papa
told
me
he
would
take
me
with
him
as
soon
as
i
had
taken
my
degree
and
grown
up
last
october
after
my
examination
he
wrote
and
told
me
to
be
patient
a
little
longer
and
that
he
was
hurrying
on
with
the
winding
up
of
his
business
and
coming
back
to
france
that
gave
me
a
hope
which
has
brightened
these
last
few
months
and
will
also
make
you
understand
why
i
am
so
pleased
this
morning
at
my
fathers
coming
it
seems
to
me
that
a
new
life
is
going
to
begin
day
was
breaking
now
a
dirty
december
day
with
the
light
filtering
through
heavy
grey
clouds
that
drifted
along
the
ground
hid
the
horizon
clung
to
the
low
hills
and
then
suddenly
dispersed
in
long
wisps
driven
by
a
keen
breeze
that
got
up
in
gusts
and
drove
clouds
of
dust
along
the
hard
frozen
ground
i
have
not
been
very
happy
either
said
thérèse
for
i
lost
my
father
when
i
was
tiny
i
do
even
remember
him
and
mamma
must
be
dead
as
well
the
ambiguous
turning
of
the
child
phrase
caught
charles
interested
attention
what
does
that
mean
thérèse
do
you
know
if
your
mother
is
dead
yes
oh
yes
grandmamma
says
so
but
whenever
i
ask
for
particulars
grandmamma
always
changes
the
subject
i
will
echo
what
you
said
just
now
when
you
are
little
you
do
know
anything
and
are
not
surprised
at
anything
for
a
long
time
i
took
no
notice
of
her
sudden
reticence
but
now
i
sometimes
wonder
if
something
is
not
being
kept
back
from
me
whether
it
is
really
true
that
mamma
is
no
more
in
this
world
talking
like
this
thérèse
and
charles
had
walked
at
a
good
pace
and
now
they
came
to
the
few
houses
built
around
verrières
station
one
by
one
bedroom
windows
and
doors
were
being
opened
peasants
were
making
their
way
to
the
sheds
to
lead
their
cattle
to
the
pastures
we
are
very
early
thérèse
remarked
pointing
to
the
station
clock
in
the
distance
your
father
train
is
due
at
and
it
is
only
now
we
still
have
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
wait
and
more
if
the
train
is
not
punctual
they
went
into
the
little
station
and
charles
rambert
thankful
for
some
shelter
from
the
cold
stamped
his
feet
making
a
sudden
uproar
in
the
empty
a
porter
appeared
who
the
deuce
is
kicking
up
all
this
row
he
began
angrily
and
then
seeing
thérèse
broke
off
short
ah
mademoiselle
thérèse
he
said
with
the
familiar
yet
perfectly
respectful
cordiality
that
marks
country
folk
up
already
have
you
come
to
meet
somebody
or
are
you
going
away
as
he
spoke
the
porter
turned
a
curious
eye
upon
charles
rambert
whose
arrival
had
caused
quite
a
sensation
two
days
before
in
this
little
spot
where
with
but
few
exceptions
none
but
people
belonging
to
the
neighbourhood
ever
came
by
train
no
i
am
not
going
away
thérèse
replied
i
have
accompanied
rambert
who
has
come
to
meet
his
father
to
meet
your
papa
sir
is
he
coming
from
far
from
paris
charles
rambert
answered
is
the
train
signalled
yet
the
man
drew
out
a
watch
like
a
turnip
and
looked
at
the
time
it
wo
be
here
for
quite
another
twenty
minutes
the
work
on
the
tunnel
makes
it
necessary
to
be
careful
and
it
always
late
now
but
you
will
hear
when
the
bell
rings
that
will
be
when
the
train
is
coming
over
the
it
will
run
into
the
station
three
minutes
after
that
well
mademoiselle
i
must
get
on
with
my
work
and
the
man
left
them
thérèse
turned
to
charles
rambert
shall
we
go
on
to
the
platform
then
we
shall
see
the
train
come
in
so
they
left
the
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
whole
length
of
the
platform
thérèse
watched
the
jerky
movements
of
the
hands
of
the
clock
and
smiled
at
her
companion
five
minutes
more
and
your
father
will
be
here
four
minutes
more
ah
there
it
is
and
she
pointed
to
a
slope
in
the
distance
where
a
slight
trail
of
smoke
rose
white
against
the
blue
of
the
sky
now
clear
of
cloud
ca
you
see
it
that
is
the
steam
from
the
engine
coming
out
of
the
tunnel
ere
she
finished
speaking
the
quivering
whir
of
the
bell
echoed
through
the
empty
station
ah
said
charles
rambert
at
last
the
two
porters
who
with
the
stationmaster
constituted
the
entire
railway
staff
at
verrières
came
bustling
along
the
platform
and
while
the
bell
continued
its
monotonous
whirring
ring
pulled
forward
trucks
in
readiness
for
any
possible
luggage
puffing
portentously
the
engine
slackened
speed
and
the
heavy
train
slowed
down
and
finally
stopped
bringing
a
noisy
atmosphere
of
life
into
the
station
of
verrières
that
but
a
moment
ago
was
so
still
the
carriages
had
stopped
immediately
in
front
of
charles
and
thérèse
and
on
the
footboard
etienne
rambert
stood
a
tall
elderly
man
of
distinguished
appearance
proud
bearing
and
energetic
attitude
with
extraordinarily
keen
eyes
and
an
unusually
high
and
intelligent
forehead
seeing
thérèse
and
charles
he
seized
his
baggage
and
in
a
twinkling
had
sprung
on
to
the
platform
he
dropped
his
valise
tossed
his
bundle
of
rugs
on
to
a
seat
and
gripped
charles
by
the
two
shoulders
my
boy
he
exclaimed
my
dear
boy
although
he
had
hitherto
shown
so
little
affection
for
his
child
it
was
obvious
that
the
man
was
making
a
great
effort
to
restrain
his
emotion
and
was
really
moved
when
he
now
saw
him
again
as
a
grown
young
man
nor
on
his
part
did
charles
rambert
remain
unmoved
as
if
the
sudden
grip
of
this
almost
stranger
who
yet
was
his
father
had
awakened
a
world
of
memories
within
him
he
turned
very
pale
and
his
voice
faltered
as
he
replied
papa
dear
papa
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
thérèse
had
drawn
tactfully
aside
rambert
still
held
his
son
by
the
shoulders
and
stepped
back
a
pace
the
better
to
consider
him
why
you
are
a
man
how
you
have
altered
my
boy
you
are
just
what
i
hoped
you
would
be
tall
and
strong
ah
you
are
my
son
all
right
and
you
are
quite
well
hey
yet
you
look
tired
i
did
not
sleep
well
charles
explained
with
a
smile
i
was
afraid
i
should
not
wake
up
turning
his
head
rambert
saw
thérèse
and
held
out
his
hand
how
do
you
do
my
little
thérèse
he
exclaimed
you
have
altered
too
since
i
saw
you
last
i
left
a
little
chit
of
a
child
and
now
i
behold
a
young
lady
well
i
must
be
off
at
once
to
pay
my
respects
to
my
dear
old
friend
your
grandmother
all
well
at
the
château
eh
thérèse
shook
hands
warmly
with
rambert
and
thanked
him
prettily
grandmamma
is
very
well
she
told
me
to
tell
you
to
excuse
her
if
she
did
not
come
to
meet
you
but
her
doctor
says
she
must
not
get
up
very
early
of
course
your
grandmamma
is
excused
my
dear
besides
i
have
to
thank
her
for
her
kindness
to
charles
and
for
the
hospitality
she
is
going
to
extend
to
me
for
a
few
days
meanwhile
the
train
had
gone
on
again
and
now
a
porter
came
up
to
rambert
will
you
take
your
luggage
with
you
sir
recalled
to
material
things
etienne
rambert
contemplated
his
trunk
which
the
porters
had
taken
out
of
the
luggage
van
good
lord
he
began
but
thérèse
interrupted
him
grandmamma
said
she
would
send
for
your
heavy
luggage
during
the
morning
and
that
you
could
take
your
valise
and
any
small
parcels
with
us
in
the
brougham
what
that
your
grandmamma
has
taken
the
trouble
to
send
her
carriage
it
a
long
way
to
beaulieu
you
know
thérèse
replied
ask
charles
if
it
is
we
came
on
foot
and
the
walk
would
be
too
tiring
for
you
after
a
whole
night
in
the
train
the
three
had
reached
the
station
yard
and
thérèse
stopped
in
surprise
why
how
that
she
exclaimed
the
carriage
is
not
here
and
yet
jean
was
beginning
to
get
it
ready
when
we
left
the
château
etienne
rambert
was
resting
one
hand
on
his
son
shoulder
and
contemplating
him
with
an
affectionate
survey
every
now
and
then
he
smiled
at
thérèse
he
may
have
been
delayed
dear
i
tell
you
what
we
will
do
since
your
grandmamma
is
going
to
send
for
my
luggage
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
take
my
valise
we
can
leave
everything
in
the
and
start
for
the
château
on
foot
if
my
memory
serves
me
right
and
it
is
a
very
good
memory
there
is
only
one
road
so
we
shall
meet
jean
and
can
get
into
the
carriage
on
the
way
a
few
minutes
later
all
three
set
out
on
the
road
to
beaulieu
rambert
walked
between
the
two
young
people
he
had
gallantly
offered
his
arm
to
thérèse
who
was
not
a
little
proud
of
the
attention
which
proved
to
her
mind
that
she
was
now
regarded
as
a
young
lady
on
the
other
side
of
his
father
charles
made
answer
to
the
incessant
questions
put
to
him
etienne
rambert
enjoyed
the
walk
in
the
quiet
morning
through
the
peaceful
with
a
tender
he
recognised
every
turn
in
the
road
every
bit
of
scenery
just
fancy
my
coming
back
here
at
sixty
years
of
age
with
a
great
son
of
eighteen
he
said
with
a
laugh
and
i
remember
as
if
it
were
yesterday
the
good
times
i
have
had
at
the
château
of
beaulieu
mme
de
langrune
and
i
will
have
plenty
of
memories
to
talk
over
gad
it
must
be
quite
forty
years
since
i
came
this
way
and
yet
i
remember
every
bit
of
it
say
thérèse
is
it
the
fact
that
we
shall
see
the
front
of
the
château
directly
we
have
passed
this
little
copse
quite
true
the
girl
answered
with
a
laugh
you
know
the
country
very
well
sir
yes
said
etienne
rambert
when
one
gets
to
my
age
little
thérèse
one
always
does
remember
the
happy
days
of
one
youth
one
remembers
recent
events
much
less
distinctly
most
likely
that
means
my
dear
that
the
human
heart
declines
to
grow
old
and
refuses
to
preserve
any
but
pictures
of
childhood
for
a
few
minutes
rambert
remained
silent
as
if
absorbed
in
somewhat
melancholy
reflections
but
he
soon
recovered
himself
and
shook
off
the
tender
sadness
evoked
in
his
mind
by
memories
of
the
past
why
the
park
enclosure
has
been
altered
he
exclaimed
here
is
a
wall
which
used
not
to
be
here
there
was
only
a
hedge
thérèse
laughed
i
never
knew
the
hedge
she
said
i
have
always
seen
the
wall
must
we
go
on
to
the
main
gate
rambert
asked
or
has
your
grandmamma
had
another
gate
made
we
are
going
in
by
the
the
girl
answered
then
we
shall
hear
why
jean
did
not
come
to
meet
us
she
opened
a
little
door
among
the
moss
and
ivy
that
clothed
the
wall
surrounding
the
park
and
making
rambert
and
charles
pass
in
before
her
cried
but
jean
gone
with
the
brougham
for
the
horses
are
not
in
the
stable
how
was
it
we
did
not
meet
him
then
she
laughed
poor
jean
he
is
so
i
would
not
mind
betting
he
went
to
meet
us
at
as
he
does
every
morning
to
bring
me
home
from
church
the
little
company
etienne
rambert
thérèse
and
charles
were
now
approaching
the
château
passing
beneath
mme
de
langrune
windows
thérèse
called
merrily
up
to
them
here
we
are
grandmamma
there
was
no
reply
but
at
the
window
of
an
adjoining
room
appeared
the
figure
of
the
steward
dollon
making
a
gesture
as
if
asking
for
silence
thérèse
in
advance
of
her
guests
had
proceeded
but
a
few
yards
when
mme
de
langrune
old
servant
rushed
down
the
stone
flight
of
steps
in
front
of
the
château
towards
rambert
dollon
seemed
distraught
usually
so
respectful
and
so
deferential
in
manner
he
now
seized
rambert
by
the
arm
and
imperiously
waving
thérèse
and
charles
away
drew
him
aside
it
is
awful
sir
he
exclaimed
horrible
a
fearful
thing
has
happened
we
have
just
found
mme
la
marquise
dead
murdered
in
her
room
iii
the
hunt
for
the
man
de
presles
the
examining
magistrate
in
charge
of
the
court
at
brives
had
just
arrived
at
the
château
of
beaulieu
having
been
notified
of
the
tragedy
by
the
police
sergeant
stationed
at
the
magistrate
was
a
young
fashionable
and
rather
aristocratic
man
of
the
world
whose
grievance
it
was
to
be
tied
down
to
work
that
was
mechanical
rather
than
intellectual
he
was
essentially
modern
in
his
ideas
and
his
chief
ambition
was
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
small
provincial
town
to
which
he
had
been
exiled
by
the
changes
and
chances
of
promotion
he
was
sick
of
brives
and
now
it
occurred
to
him
that
a
crime
like
this
present
one
would
give
him
an
opportunity
of
displaying
his
gifts
of
intuition
and
deduction
prove
his
quality
and
so
might
enable
him
to
get
another
appointment
after
dollon
had
received
him
at
the
château
the
magistrate
had
first
of
all
made
enquiry
as
to
who
was
in
the
house
at
the
time
from
the
information
given
him
he
was
satisfied
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
subject
either
thérèse
or
charles
rambert
to
immediate
examination
both
of
the
young
people
being
much
too
upset
to
be
able
to
reply
to
serious
questions
and
both
having
been
taken
away
to
the
house
of
the
baronne
de
vibray
it
was
also
clear
that
rambert
senior
who
had
only
arrived
after
the
crime
could
not
furnish
any
interesting
information
tell
me
exactly
how
you
discovered
the
crime
dollon
he
said
as
pale
and
trembling
the
steward
accompanied
him
along
the
corridor
to
the
scene
of
the
murder
i
went
this
morning
as
usual
sir
the
steward
replied
to
say
good
morning
to
mme
de
langrune
and
receive
her
orders
for
the
day
i
knocked
at
her
door
as
i
always
did
but
got
no
answer
i
knocked
louder
but
still
there
was
no
answer
i
do
know
why
i
opened
the
door
instead
of
going
away
perhaps
i
had
some
kind
of
presentiment
oh
i
shall
never
forget
the
shock
i
had
when
i
saw
my
poor
dear
mistress
lying
dead
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
steeped
in
blood
and
with
such
a
horrible
gash
in
her
throat
that
for
a
moment
i
thought
her
head
was
severed
from
the
trunk
the
police
sergeant
corroborated
the
steward
story
the
murder
certainly
was
committed
with
peculiarly
horrible
violence
sir
he
remarked
the
body
shows
that
the
victim
was
struck
with
the
utmost
fury
the
murderer
must
have
gone
mad
over
the
corpse
from
sheer
lust
of
blood
the
wounds
are
shocking
knife
wounds
de
presles
asked
i
do
know
said
the
sergeant
uncertainly
your
worship
can
form
your
own
opinion
the
magistrate
followed
the
steward
into
the
room
where
dollon
had
taken
care
that
nothing
was
touched
in
its
furniture
and
general
arrangement
mme
de
langrune
room
corresponded
with
the
character
of
the
old
lady
it
was
large
and
quietly
furnished
with
old
presses
chairs
and
tables
it
was
evident
that
she
had
had
no
liking
for
modern
fashions
but
had
preferred
to
have
her
own
room
stamped
with
the
rather
severe
yet
very
comfortable
character
of
former
days
the
whole
of
one
side
of
the
room
was
filled
by
the
marquise
bed
it
was
large
and
raised
upon
a
kind
of
dais
covered
with
a
carpet
of
subdued
tones
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
on
the
right
was
a
large
window
fastened
half
open
despite
the
keen
cold
no
doubt
for
hygienic
reasons
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
round
mahogany
table
with
a
few
small
articles
upon
it
a
books
and
so
on
in
one
corner
a
large
crucifix
was
suspended
from
the
wall
with
a
in
front
of
it
the
velvet
of
which
had
been
worn
white
by
the
old
lady
knees
finally
a
little
further
away
was
a
small
escritoire
half
open
now
with
its
drawers
gaping
and
papers
scattered
on
the
floor
there
were
only
two
ways
of
ingress
into
the
room
one
by
the
door
through
which
the
magistrate
had
entered
which
opened
on
to
the
main
corridor
on
the
first
floor
and
the
other
by
a
door
communicating
with
the
marquise
this
was
lighted
by
a
large
window
which
was
shut
the
magistrate
was
shocked
by
the
spectacle
presented
by
the
corpse
of
the
marquise
it
was
lying
on
its
back
on
the
floor
with
the
arms
extended
the
head
was
towards
the
bed
the
feet
towards
the
window
the
body
was
almost
naked
a
gash
ran
almost
right
across
the
throat
leaving
the
bones
exposed
torrents
of
blood
had
saturated
the
clothes
and
on
the
carpet
round
the
body
a
wide
stain
was
still
slowly
spreading
wider
de
presles
stooped
over
the
dead
woman
what
an
appalling
wound
he
muttered
the
medical
evidence
will
explain
what
weapon
it
was
made
with
but
no
doctor
is
required
to
point
out
the
violence
of
the
blow
or
the
fury
of
the
murderer
he
turned
to
the
old
steward
who
at
sight
of
his
mistress
could
hardly
restrain
his
tears
nothing
has
been
moved
in
the
room
eh
nothing
sir
the
magistrate
pointed
to
the
escritoire
with
its
open
drawers
that
has
not
been
touched
no
sir
i
suppose
that
is
where
mme
de
langrune
kept
her
valuables
the
steward
shook
his
head
the
marquise
could
not
have
had
any
large
sum
of
money
in
the
house
a
few
hundred
francs
perhaps
for
daily
expenses
but
certainly
no
more
so
you
do
not
think
robbery
was
the
motive
of
the
crime
the
steward
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
murderer
may
have
thought
that
mme
de
langrune
had
money
here
sir
but
anyhow
he
must
have
been
disturbed
because
he
did
not
take
away
the
rings
the
marquise
had
laid
upon
the
before
she
got
into
bed
the
magistrate
walked
slowly
round
the
room
this
window
was
open
he
asked
the
marquise
always
left
it
like
that
she
liked
all
the
fresh
air
she
could
get
might
not
the
murderer
have
got
in
that
way
the
steward
shook
his
head
it
is
most
unlikely
sir
see
the
windows
are
fitted
outside
with
a
kind
of
grating
pointing
outwards
and
downwards
and
i
think
that
would
prevent
anyone
from
climbing
in
de
presles
saw
that
this
was
so
continuing
his
investigation
he
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
nothing
about
the
furniture
in
that
room
or
in
the
to
show
that
the
murderer
had
been
through
them
except
the
disorder
on
and
about
the
little
escritoire
at
last
he
came
to
the
door
which
opened
on
to
the
corridor
ah
he
exclaimed
this
is
interesting
and
with
a
finger
he
pointed
to
the
inner
bolt
on
the
door
the
screws
of
which
were
wrenched
half
out
showing
that
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
force
the
door
did
mme
de
langrune
bolt
her
door
every
night
he
asked
yes
always
dollon
answered
she
was
very
nervous
and
if
i
was
the
first
to
come
to
bid
her
good
morning
i
always
heard
her
unfasten
that
bolt
when
i
knocked
de
presles
made
no
reply
he
made
one
more
tour
of
the
room
minutely
considering
the
situation
of
each
single
article
dollon
will
you
kindly
take
me
where
i
can
have
the
use
of
a
table
and
inkstand
and
anything
else
i
may
need
to
get
on
with
my
preliminary
enquiry
your
clerk
is
waiting
for
you
in
the
library
sir
the
steward
replied
he
has
everything
ready
for
you
there
very
well
if
it
is
convenient
to
you
we
will
join
him
now
de
presles
followed
dollon
down
to
the
library
on
the
ground
floor
where
his
enterprising
clerk
had
already
established
himself
the
magistrate
took
his
seat
behind
a
large
table
and
called
to
the
police
sergeant
i
shall
ask
you
to
be
present
during
my
enquiry
sergeant
the
first
investigations
will
devolve
upon
you
so
it
will
be
well
for
you
to
hear
all
the
details
the
witnesses
can
furnish
me
with
i
suppose
you
have
taken
no
steps
as
yet
beg
pardon
sir
i
have
sent
my
men
out
in
all
directions
with
orders
to
interrogate
all
tramps
and
to
detain
any
who
do
not
give
a
satisfactory
account
of
their
time
last
night
good
by
the
way
while
i
think
of
it
have
you
sent
off
the
telegram
i
gave
you
when
i
arrived
the
telegram
to
the
police
in
paris
asking
for
a
detective
to
be
sent
down
i
took
it
to
the
telegraph
office
myself
sir
his
mind
made
easy
on
this
score
the
young
magistrate
turned
to
dollon
will
you
please
take
a
seat
sir
he
said
and
disregarding
the
disapproving
looks
of
his
clerk
who
had
a
particular
predilection
for
all
the
long
circumlocutions
and
red
tape
of
the
law
he
pretermitted
the
usual
questions
as
to
name
and
age
and
occupation
of
the
witnesses
and
began
his
enquiry
by
questioning
the
old
steward
what
is
the
exact
plan
of
the
château
was
his
first
enquiry
you
know
it
now
sir
almost
as
well
as
i
do
the
passage
from
the
front
door
leads
to
the
main
staircase
which
we
went
up
just
now
to
the
first
floor
where
the
bedroom
of
the
marquise
is
situated
the
first
floor
contains
a
series
of
rooms
separated
by
a
corridor
on
the
right
is
mlle
thérèse
room
and
then
come
which
are
not
occupied
now
on
the
left
is
the
bedroom
of
the
marquise
followed
by
her
on
the
same
side
and
after
that
there
is
another
and
then
the
bedroom
occupied
by
charles
rambert
good
and
the
floor
above
how
is
that
arranged
the
second
floor
is
exactly
like
the
first
floor
sir
except
that
there
are
only
servants
rooms
there
they
are
smaller
and
there
are
more
of
them
what
servants
sleep
in
the
house
as
a
general
rule
sir
the
two
marie
the
housemaid
and
louise
the
cook
and
also
hervé
the
butler
but
hervé
did
not
sleep
in
the
château
last
night
he
had
asked
the
mistress
permission
to
go
into
the
village
and
she
had
given
it
to
him
on
condition
that
he
did
not
come
back
that
night
what
do
you
mean
enquired
the
magistrate
rather
surprised
the
marquise
was
rather
nervous
sir
and
did
not
like
the
idea
of
anyone
being
able
to
get
into
the
house
at
night
so
she
was
always
careful
to
the
front
door
and
the
kitchen
door
herself
every
night
she
went
round
all
the
rooms
too
every
night
and
made
sure
that
all
the
iron
shutters
were
properly
fastened
and
that
it
was
impossible
for
anyone
to
get
into
the
house
when
hervé
goes
out
in
the
evenings
he
either
sleeps
in
the
village
and
does
not
return
till
the
following
morning
which
is
what
he
did
or
else
he
asks
the
coachman
to
leave
the
yard
door
unlocked
and
sleeps
in
a
room
above
the
stables
which
as
a
rule
is
not
occupied
that
is
where
the
other
servants
sleep
i
suppose
yes
sir
the
gardeners
the
coachman
and
the
keepers
all
live
in
the
with
regard
to
myself
i
have
a
small
cottage
a
little
farther
away
in
the
park
de
presles
sat
silent
for
a
few
moments
thinking
deeply
the
only
sound
in
the
room
was
the
irritating
squeak
of
the
clerk
quill
pen
as
he
industriously
wrote
down
all
the
steward
replies
at
last
de
presles
looked
up
so
on
the
night
of
the
crime
the
only
persons
sleeping
in
the
château
were
mme
de
langrune
her
granddaughter
mlle
thérèse
charles
rambert
and
the
two
maids
is
that
so
yes
sir
then
it
does
not
seem
likely
that
the
crime
was
committed
by
anyone
living
in
the
château
that
is
so
sir
and
yet
i
do
not
believe
that
anybody
got
into
the
château
only
two
people
had
a
key
of
the
front
door
the
marquise
and
myself
when
i
got
to
the
house
this
morning
i
found
the
door
open
because
mlle
thérèse
went
out
early
with
charles
rambert
to
meet
rambert
senior
at
the
station
and
she
opened
the
door
with
the
keys
that
the
marquise
had
given
into
her
care
the
night
before
but
she
told
me
herself
that
when
she
started
to
meet
the
train
at
five
the
door
was
shut
mlle
thérèse
had
put
her
keys
under
her
pillow
and
my
bunch
had
never
left
my
possession
is
it
not
possible
the
magistrate
suggested
that
someone
may
have
got
in
during
the
day
hidden
himself
and
have
committed
the
crime
when
night
came
remember
dollon
the
bolt
inside
mme
de
bedroom
door
has
been
wrenched
away
that
means
that
the
murderer
made
his
entrance
by
that
door
and
made
it
by
force
but
the
steward
shook
his
head
no
sir
nobody
could
have
secreted
himself
in
the
château
during
the
day
people
are
always
coming
to
the
kitchen
so
the
back
door
is
under
constant
supervision
and
all
yesterday
afternoon
there
were
gardeners
at
work
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
main
entrance
if
any
stranger
had
presented
himself
there
he
would
certainly
have
been
seen
and
finally
mme
de
langrune
had
given
orders
which
i
always
attended
to
myself
to
keep
the
door
locked
through
which
one
gets
down
to
the
cellars
so
the
murderer
could
not
have
hidden
in
the
basement
and
where
else
could
he
have
hidden
not
in
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
there
was
company
to
dinner
last
night
and
all
the
rooms
were
used
more
or
less
the
marquise
or
some
one
of
the
guests
would
certainly
have
discovered
him
so
he
would
have
had
to
be
upstairs
either
on
the
first
or
second
floor
that
is
most
unlikely
it
would
have
been
very
risky
besides
the
big
is
fastened
up
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
during
the
day
and
he
would
not
have
let
any
stranger
pass
him
either
the
dog
must
have
known
the
man
or
at
all
events
some
meat
must
have
been
thrown
to
him
but
there
are
no
traces
to
show
that
anything
of
the
sort
was
done
the
magistrate
was
much
perplexed
then
the
crime
is
inexplicable
dollon
you
have
just
told
me
yourself
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
château
but
mme
de
langrune
the
two
young
people
thérèse
and
charles
and
the
two
maids
it
certainly
is
not
any
one
of
those
who
can
be
the
guilty
person
for
the
way
in
which
the
crime
was
committed
and
the
force
of
the
blows
dealt
show
that
the
criminal
was
a
man
a
professional
murderer
in
fact
consequently
the
guilty
person
must
have
got
in
from
outside
come
now
have
you
no
suspicions
at
all
the
steward
raised
his
arms
and
let
them
fall
in
utter
dejection
no
he
replied
at
last
i
do
not
suspect
anybody
i
can
not
suspect
anybody
but
sir
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
feel
certain
that
although
the
murderer
was
not
one
of
those
who
occupied
the
château
last
night
he
nevertheless
did
not
come
in
from
outside
it
was
not
possible
the
doors
were
locked
and
the
shutters
were
fastened
nevertheless
de
presles
remarked
inasmuch
as
someone
has
committed
a
murder
it
must
necessarily
be
the
fact
either
that
that
someone
was
hidden
inside
the
château
when
mme
de
langrune
herself
locked
the
front
door
or
else
that
he
got
in
during
the
night
do
you
not
see
yourself
dollon
that
one
or
other
of
these
two
hypotheses
must
be
correct
the
steward
hesitated
it
is
a
mystery
sir
he
declared
at
last
i
swear
to
you
sir
that
nobody
could
have
got
in
and
yet
it
is
perfectly
clear
also
that
neither
charles
nor
mlle
thérèse
nor
yet
either
of
the
two
maids
marie
and
louise
is
the
murderer
de
presles
sat
wrapped
in
thought
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
desired
the
old
steward
to
fetch
the
two
women
servants
come
back
yourself
he
added
as
the
old
man
went
away
i
may
require
further
particulars
from
you
dollon
left
the
room
and
gigou
the
clerk
leant
forward
towards
the
magistrate
tact
was
not
the
most
shining
of
gigou
qualities
when
your
enquiry
is
finished
sir
presently
we
shall
have
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
mayor
of
that
is
in
accordance
with
the
usual
procedure
and
then
he
can
not
do
less
than
invite
us
to
stay
to
dinner
iv
no
i
am
not
mad
the
next
day
but
one
after
the
crime
on
the
friday
louise
the
cook
who
was
still
terribly
upset
by
the
dreadful
death
of
the
good
mistress
in
whose
service
she
had
been
for
fifteen
years
came
down
to
her
kitchen
early
it
was
scarcely
daybreak
and
the
good
woman
was
obliged
to
light
a
lamp
to
see
by
with
her
mind
anywhere
but
on
her
work
she
was
mechanically
getting
breakfast
for
the
servants
and
for
the
visitors
to
the
château
when
a
sharp
knock
on
the
back
door
made
her
jump
she
went
to
open
it
and
uttered
a
little
scream
as
she
saw
the
cocked
hats
of
gendarmes
silhouetted
against
the
wan
light
of
the
early
morning
between
the
gendarmes
were
two
specimens
of
humanity
louise
had
only
opened
the
door
a
few
inches
when
the
sergeant
who
had
known
her
for
many
years
took
a
step
forward
and
gave
her
a
military
salute
i
must
ask
your
hospitality
for
us
and
for
these
two
fellows
whom
we
have
taken
up
prowling
about
the
neighbourhood
he
said
the
dismayed
louise
broke
in
good
heavens
sergeant
are
you
bringing
thieves
here
where
do
you
expect
me
to
put
them
surely
there
enough
trouble
in
the
house
as
it
is
the
gendarme
morand
smiled
with
the
disillusioned
air
of
a
man
who
knows
very
well
what
trouble
is
and
the
sergeant
replied
put
them
why
in
your
kitchen
of
course
and
as
the
servant
made
a
sign
of
refusal
he
added
i
am
sorry
but
you
must
besides
nothing
for
you
to
be
afraid
of
the
men
are
handcuffed
and
we
shall
not
leave
them
we
are
going
to
wait
here
for
the
magistrate
who
will
examine
them
the
gendarmes
had
pushed
their
wretched
captives
in
before
them
two
tramps
of
the
shadiest
appearance
louise
who
had
gone
mechanically
to
raise
the
lid
of
a
kettle
beginning
to
boil
over
looked
round
at
his
last
words
the
magistrate
she
said
de
presles
why
he
is
here
now
in
the
library
no
exclaimed
the
sergeant
jumping
up
from
the
kitchen
chair
on
which
he
had
seated
himself
he
is
i
tell
you
the
old
woman
insisted
and
the
little
man
who
generally
goes
about
with
him
is
here
too
you
mean
gigou
his
clerk
very
likely
muttered
louise
i
leave
the
prisoners
with
you
morand
said
the
sergeant
curtly
do
let
them
out
of
your
sight
i
am
going
to
the
magistrate
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
wish
to
interrogate
these
fellows
at
once
the
gendarme
came
to
attention
and
saluted
trust
me
sergeant
it
looked
as
if
morand
job
was
going
to
be
an
easy
one
the
two
tramps
huddled
up
in
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
opposite
the
stove
showed
no
disposition
to
make
their
escape
the
two
were
utterly
different
in
appearance
one
was
a
tall
strongly
built
man
with
thick
hair
crowned
by
a
little
jockey
cap
and
was
enveloped
in
a
kind
of
overcoat
which
might
have
been
black
once
but
which
was
now
of
a
greenish
hue
the
result
of
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
he
gnawed
his
heavy
moustache
in
silence
and
turned
sombre
uneasy
looks
on
all
including
his
companion
in
misfortune
he
wore
hobnailed
shoes
and
carried
a
stout
cudgel
he
was
more
like
a
piece
of
the
human
wreckage
one
sees
in
the
street
corners
of
great
cities
than
a
genuine
tramp
instead
of
a
collar
there
was
a
variegated
handkerchief
round
his
neck
his
name
he
had
told
the
sergeant
was
françois
paul
the
other
man
who
had
been
discovered
at
the
back
of
a
farm
just
as
he
was
about
to
crawl
inside
a
stack
was
a
typical
country
tramp
an
old
soft
felt
hat
was
crammed
down
on
his
head
and
a
shock
of
rebellious
red
and
grey
hair
curled
up
all
round
it
while
a
hairy
beard
entirely
concealed
all
the
features
of
his
face
all
that
could
be
seen
of
it
was
a
pair
of
sparkling
eyes
incessantly
moving
in
every
possible
direction
this
second
man
contemplated
with
interest
the
place
into
which
the
police
had
conducted
him
on
his
back
he
bore
a
heavy
sort
of
wallet
in
which
he
stowed
articles
of
the
most
varied
description
whereas
his
companion
maintained
a
rigid
silence
this
man
never
stopped
talking
nudging
his
neighbour
every
now
and
then
he
whispered
say
where
do
you
come
from
you
not
from
these
parts
are
you
never
seen
you
before
have
i
everybody
round
here
knows
me
bouzille
my
name
bouzille
and
turning
to
the
gendarme
he
said
is
it
true
morand
that
you
and
i
are
old
acquaintances
this
is
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
you
pinched
me
is
it
bouzille
companion
vouchsafed
him
a
glance
so
it
a
habit
of
yours
is
it
he
said
in
the
same
low
tone
you
often
get
nabbed
as
to
the
garrulous
fellow
replied
that
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
the
word
in
winter
time
it
not
bad
business
to
go
back
to
clink
because
of
the
rotten
weather
in
the
summer
one
would
rather
go
easy
and
then
too
in
the
summer
there
is
so
much
crime
you
can
find
all
you
want
on
the
road
country
people
are
so
particular
in
the
summer
while
in
the
winter
it
quite
another
thing
so
they
have
done
me
down
for
mother
chiquard
rabbit
i
expect
the
gendarme
who
had
been
listening
with
no
great
attention
chimed
in
so
it
was
you
who
stole
the
rabbit
was
it
bouzille
what
the
good
of
your
asking
me
that
morand
protested
bouzille
i
suppose
you
would
have
left
me
alone
if
you
had
been
sure
of
it
bouzille
companion
bent
his
head
and
whispered
very
low
there
has
been
something
worse
than
that
the
job
with
the
lady
of
this
house
oh
that
said
bouzille
with
a
gesture
of
complete
indifference
but
he
did
not
proceed
the
sergeant
came
back
to
the
kitchen
and
said
sternly
françois
paul
forward
the
examining
magistrate
will
hear
you
now
the
man
summoned
stepped
towards
the
sergeant
and
quietly
submitted
to
being
taken
by
the
arm
for
his
hands
were
fastened
bouzille
winked
knowingly
at
the
gendarme
now
his
sole
remaining
confidant
and
remarked
with
satisfaction
good
luck
we
are
getting
on
not
too
much
about
it
and
as
the
gendarme
severely
keeping
his
proper
distance
made
no
reply
the
incorrigible
chatterbox
went
on
merrily
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
suits
me
just
as
well
to
be
committed
for
trial
since
the
government
give
you
your
board
and
lodging
and
especially
since
there
a
really
beautiful
prison
at
brives
now
he
leaned
familiarly
against
the
gendarme
shoulder
ah
morand
you
did
know
it
you
old
enough
why
it
was
before
you
joined
the
force
but
the
used
to
be
in
an
old
building
just
behind
the
law
courts
dirty
i
should
think
it
was
dirty
and
damp
why
once
when
i
did
three
months
there
from
january
to
april
i
came
out
so
ill
with
the
rheumatics
that
i
had
to
go
back
into
the
infirmary
for
another
fortnight
gad
he
went
on
after
a
moment
pause
during
which
he
snuffed
the
air
around
him
something
smells
jolly
good
here
he
unceremoniously
addressed
the
cook
who
was
busy
at
her
work
might
there
perhaps
be
a
bit
of
a
blow
out
for
me
mme
louise
and
as
she
turned
round
with
a
somewhat
scandalised
expression
he
continued
you
need
be
frightened
lady
you
know
me
very
well
many
a
time
i
come
and
asked
you
for
any
old
thing
and
you
always
given
me
something
dollon
too
whenever
he
has
an
old
pair
of
shoes
that
are
worn
out
well
those
are
mine
and
a
crust
of
bread
is
what
nobody
ever
refuses
the
cook
hesitated
touched
by
the
recollections
evoked
by
the
poor
tramp
she
looked
at
the
gendarme
for
a
sign
of
encouragement
morand
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
a
patronising
gaze
on
bouzille
give
him
something
if
you
like
mme
louise
after
all
he
is
well
known
and
for
my
own
part
i
do
believe
he
could
have
done
it
the
tramp
interrupted
him
ah
morand
if
it
a
matter
of
picking
up
trifles
here
and
there
a
wandering
rabbit
perhaps
or
a
fowl
that
tired
of
being
lonely
i
do
say
no
but
as
for
anything
else
kindly
lady
louise
had
handed
bouzille
a
huge
chunk
of
bread
which
he
immediately
interned
in
the
depths
of
his
enormous
bag
what
do
you
suppose
that
other
chap
can
have
to
tell
paul
pry
he
did
not
look
like
a
regular
now
when
i
get
before
the
gentlemen
in
black
i
do
want
to
contradict
them
and
so
i
always
say
my
lord
and
they
are
perfectly
satisfied
sometimes
they
laugh
and
the
president
of
the
court
says
up
bouzille
and
then
he
gives
me
a
fortnight
or
days
or
a
month
as
the
case
may
be
the
sergeant
came
back
alone
and
addressed
the
gendarme
the
other
man
has
been
discharged
he
said
as
for
bouzille
de
presles
does
not
think
there
is
any
need
to
interrogate
him
am
i
to
be
punted
out
then
enquired
the
tramp
with
some
dismay
as
he
looked
uneasily
towards
the
window
against
the
glass
of
which
rain
was
lashing
the
sergeant
could
not
restrain
a
smile
well
no
bouzille
he
said
kindly
we
must
take
you
to
the
there
the
little
matter
of
the
rabbit
to
be
cleared
up
you
know
come
now
quick
march
take
him
to
morand
the
sergeant
went
back
to
the
library
to
hold
himself
at
the
magistrate
disposal
through
the
torrential
downpour
of
rain
bouzille
and
the
gendarme
wended
their
way
to
the
village
and
left
alone
in
her
kitchen
louise
put
out
her
lamp
for
despite
the
shocking
weather
it
was
getting
lighter
now
and
communed
with
herself
i
a
kind
of
idea
that
they
would
have
done
better
to
keep
that
other
man
he
was
a
fellow
the
sad
depressing
day
had
passed
without
any
notable
incident
charles
rambert
and
his
father
had
spent
the
afternoon
with
thérèse
and
the
baronne
de
vibray
continuously
addressing
large
envelopes
to
the
relations
and
friends
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
whose
funeral
had
been
fixed
for
the
next
day
but
one
a
hasty
dinner
had
been
served
at
which
the
baronne
de
vibray
was
present
her
grief
was
distressing
to
witness
somewhat
futile
to
outward
seeming
this
woman
had
a
very
kind
and
tender
heart
as
a
matter
of
course
she
had
constituted
herself
the
protector
and
comforter
of
thérèse
and
she
had
spent
the
whole
of
the
previous
day
with
the
child
at
brives
ransacking
the
local
shops
to
procure
her
mourning
thérèse
was
terribly
shocked
by
the
dreadful
death
of
her
grandmother
whom
she
adored
but
she
displayed
unexpected
strength
of
character
and
controlled
her
grief
so
that
she
might
be
able
to
look
after
the
guests
whom
she
was
now
entertaining
for
the
first
time
as
mistress
of
the
house
the
baronne
de
vibray
had
failed
in
her
attempt
to
persuade
thérèse
to
come
with
her
to
querelles
to
sleep
thérèse
was
determined
in
her
refusal
to
leave
the
château
and
what
she
termed
her
post
of
duty
marie
will
stay
with
me
she
assured
the
kind
baronne
and
i
promise
you
i
shall
have
sufficient
courage
to
go
to
sleep
so
her
friend
got
into
her
car
alone
at
nine
and
went
back
to
her
own
house
and
thérèse
went
up
at
once
to
bed
with
marie
the
faithful
servant
who
like
louise
the
cook
had
been
with
her
ever
since
she
was
born
after
having
read
all
the
newspapers
with
their
minute
and
often
inaccurate
account
of
the
tragedy
at
beaulieu
for
everyone
in
the
château
had
been
besieged
the
previous
day
by
reporters
and
representatives
of
various

etienne
rambert
said
to
his
son
simply
but
with
a
marked
gravity
let
us
go
upstairs
my
son
it
is
time
at
the
door
of
his
room
charles
deferentially
offered
his
cheek
to
his
father
but
etienne
rambert
seemed
to
hesitate
then
as
if
taking
a
sudden
resolution
he
entered
his
son
room
instead
of
going
on
to
his
own
charles
kept
silence
and
refrained
from
asking
any
questions
for
he
had
noticed
how
lost
in
sad
thought
his
father
had
seemed
to
be
since
the
day
before
charles
rambert
was
very
tired
he
began
to
undress
at
once
he
had
taken
off
his
coat
and
waistcoat
and
was
turning
towards
a
to
undo
his
tie
when
his
father
came
up
to
him
with
an
abrupt
movement
etienne
rambert
put
both
his
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
then
in
a
stifled
but
peremptory
tone
he
said
now
confess
unhappy
boy
confess
to
your
father
charles
went
ghastly
white
what
he
muttered
etienne
rambert
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
him
it
was
you
who
committed
the
murder
the
ringing
denial
that
the
young
man
tried
to
utter
was
strangled
in
his
throat
he
threw
out
his
arms
and
groped
with
his
hands
as
if
to
find
something
to
support
him
in
his
faintness
then
he
pulled
himself
together
committed
the
murder
i
you
accuse
me
of
having
killed
the
marquise
it
is
infamous
hateful
awful
alas
yes
no
no
good
god
no
yes
etienne
rambert
insisted
the
two
men
faced
each
other
panting
charles
controlled
the
emotion
which
was
sweeping
over
him
once
more
and
looking
steadily
at
his
father
said
in
tones
of
bitter
reproach
and
it
is
actually
my
own
father
who
says
that
who
suspects
me
tears
filled
the
young
fellow
eyes
and
sobs
choked
him
he
grew
whiter
still
and
seemed
so
near
collapse
that
his
father
had
to
support
him
to
a
chair
where
he
remained
for
several
minutes
utterly
prostrated
rambert
paced
up
and
down
the
room
a
few
times
then
took
another
chair
and
sat
down
in
front
of
his
son
passing
a
hand
across
his
brow
as
if
to
sweep
away
the
horrible
nightmare
that
was
haunting
him
he
spoke
again
come
now
my
boy
my
poor
boy
let
us
talk
it
over
quietly
i
do
not
know
how
it
was
but
yesterday
morning
when
i
saw
you
at
the
station
i
had
a
presentiment
of
something
you
were
haggard
and
tired
and
your
eyes
were
drawn
i
told
you
before
charles
answered
tonelessly
that
i
had
had
a
bad
night
i
was
and
did
not
sleep
i
was
awake
the
whole
night
by
jove
yes
his
father
rapped
out
i
can
believe
that
but
if
you
were
not
asleep
how
do
you
account
for
your
not
hearing
anything
thérèse
did
not
hear
anything
either
said
charles
after
a
reflection
thérèse
room
was
a
long
way
off
rambert
replied
while
there
was
only
a
thin
wall
between
yours
and
that
of
the
marquise
you
must
have
heard
you
did
hear
more
than
that
oh
my
boy
my
unhappy
boy
charles
was
twisting
and
untwisting
his
hands
and
great
drops
of
cold
perspiration
beaded
his
brow
you
are
the
only
single
person
who
thinks
i
committed
such
an
awful
crime
he
said
half
questioningly
the
only
one
etienne
rambert
muttered
perhaps
as
yet
but
you
ought
to
know
that
you
made
a
very
bad
impression
indeed
upon
the
friends
of
the
marquise
during
the
evening
before
the
crime
when
president
bonnet
was
reading
the
particulars
of
a
murder
that
had
been
committed
in
paris
by
somebody
i
forget
whom
good
heavens
charles
exclaimed
in
indignation
i
did
not
say
anything
wrong
do
you
mean
to
say
that
just
because
i
am
interested
in
stories
of
great
criminals
like
rocambole
and
fantômas
you
created
a
deplorable
impression
his
father
repeated
so
they
suspect
me
too
do
they
charles
enquired
but
you
ca
make
accusations
like
that
he
said
warming
up
you
got
to
have
facts
and
proofs
he
looked
at
his
father
for
the
sympathy
and
encouragement
of
affection
listen
papa
i
know
you
will
believe
me
when
i
swear
that
i
am
innocent
but
do
you
think
other
people
etienne
rambert
sat
with
his
head
between
his
hands
wrapped
in
thought
there
was
a
short
silence
before
the
unhappy
father
replied
unfortunately
there
is
evidence
against
you
he
said
at
last
and
damning
evidence
too
he
added
with
a
glance
at
his
son
that
seemed
to
pulverise
him
terrible
evidence
consider
charles
the
magistrates
have
decided
as
a
result
of
their
investigations
that
no
one
got
into
the
château
on
the
fatal
night
you
were
the
only
man
who
slept
there
and
none
but
a
man
could
possibly
have
committed
such
a
horrible
crime
such
a
monstrous
piece
of
butchery
someone
might
have
got
in
from
outside
the
unhappy
lad
urged
as
if
trying
to
escape
from
the
network
in
which
he
was
being
entangled
no
one
did
etienne
rambert
insisted
besides
how
could
you
prove
it
charles
was
silent
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
trembling
legs
and
haggard
eyes
seemingly
stupefied
and
incapable
of
coherent
thought
vacantly
watching
his
father
with
bent
head
and
shoulders
bowed
as
though
beneath
a
load
etienne
rambert
moved
towards
the
attached
to
the
bedroom
come
here
he
said
in
an
almost
inaudible
voice
follow
me
he
went
into
the
and
picking
up
the
towels
that
were
heaped
anyhow
on
the
lower
rail
of
the
washstand
he
selected
a
very
crumpled
one
and
held
it
out
in
front
of
his
son
look
at
that
he
said
in
a
low
curt
tone
and
on
the
towel
thus
held
in
the
light
charles
rambert
saw
red
stains
of
blood
the
lad
started
and
was
about
to
burst
into
some
protestation
but
etienne
rambert
imperiously
checked
him
do
you
still
deny
it
unhappy
wretched
boy
there
is
the
convincing
irrefutable
evidence
of
your
guilt
these
stains
of
blood
proclaim
it
something
always
is
overlooked
how
are
you
to
explain
the
presence
of
this
linen
in
your
room
can
you
still
deny
that
it
is
proof
positive
of
your
guilt
but
i
do
deny
it
i
do
deny
it
i
do
understand
i
know
nothing
about
it
and
once
more
charles
rambert
collapsed
into
the
the
unhappy
lad
was
nothing
but
a
human
wreck
with
no
strength
to
argue
or
even
utter
a
word
his
father
eyes
rested
on
him
filled
with
infinite
affection
and
profoundest
pity
my
poor
poor
boy
the
unhappy
etienne
rambert
murmured
and
added
as
if
speaking
only
to
himself
i
wonder
if
you
are
not
entirely
responsible
if
there
are
circumstances
to
plead
for
you
do
you
still
accuse
me
papa
do
you
really
believe
i
am
the
murderer
etienne
rambert
shook
his
head
hopelessly
oh
i
wish
i
wish
he
exclaimed
that
for
the
honour
of
our
name
and
for
the
sake
of
those
who
love
us
i
could
prove
you
had
congenital
hereditary
tendencies
that
made
you
not
responsible
why
could
not
i
have
watched
over
your
upbringing
why
has
fate
decreed
that
i
should
only
see
my
son
three
times
at
most
in
eighteen
years
and
come
home
to
find
him
a
criminal
oh
if
science
could
but
establish
the
fact
that
the
child
of
a
tainted
mother
tainted
charles
exclaimed
what
do
you
mean
tainted
with
a
terrible
and
mysterious
disease
etienne
rambert
went
on
a
disease
before
which
we
are
powerless
and
unarmed
insanity
what
cried
charles
growing
momentarily
more
distressed
and
bewildered
what
is
that
papa
are
my
wits
going
my
mother
insane
and
then
he
added
hopelessly
my
god
you
must
be
right
often
and
often
i
have
been
amazed
by
her
strange
puzzling
looks
and
behaviour
but
i
i
have
all
my
proper
senses
i
know
what
i
am
doing
was
it
perhaps
some
appalling
hallucination
etienne
rambert
suggested
some
moment
of
irresponsibility
but
charles
saw
what
he
meant
and
cut
him
short
no
no
papa
i
am
not
mad
i
am
not
mad
i
am
not
mad
in
his
intense
excitement
the
young
fellow
never
thought
of
moderating
the
tone
of
his
voice
but
shouted
out
what
was
in
his
mind
shouted
it
into
the
silence
of
the
night
heedless
of
all
but
this
terrible
discussion
he
was
having
with
the
father
whom
he
loved
nor
did
etienne
rambert
lower
his
voice
his
son
impassioned
protest
wrung
the
retort
from
him
then
charles
if
you
are
right
your
crime
is
beyond
forgiveness
murderer
murderer
the
two
men
stopped
short
as
a
slight
sound
in
the
passage
caught
their
attention
a
silence
fell
upon
them
that
they
could
not
break
and
they
stood
dumbfounded
nervous
and
overwrought
the
door
of
the
room
opened
very
slowly
and
a
white
form
appeared
against
the
darkness
of
the
corridor
outside
robed
in
a
long
thérèse
stood
there
with
hair
dishevelled
bloodless
lips
and
eyes
dilated
with
horror
the
child
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
as
if
every
movement
hurt
her
she
painfully
raised
her
arm
and
pointed
to
charles
thérèse
etienne
rambert
muttered
thérèse
you
were
outside
the
child
lips
moved
she
seemed
to
be
making
a
more
than
human
effort
and
a
whisper
escaped
her
lips
yes
but
she
could
say
no
more
her
eyes
rolled
her
whole
frame
tottered
and
then
without
sign
or
cry
she
fell
rigid
and
unconscious
to
the
floor
arrest
me
twelve
or
thirteen
miles
from
souillac
the
main
line
from
brives
to
cahors
which
flanks
the
slope
describes
a
rather
sharp
curve
the
journey
is
a
particularly
picturesque
one
and
travellers
who
make
it
during
the
daytime
have
much
that
is
interesting
and
agreeable
to
see
but
while
they
are
admiring
the
country
which
marks
the
transition
from
the
severe
region
of
the
limousin
to
the
more
laughing
landscapes
on
the
confines
of
the
midi
the
train
suddenly
plunges
into
a
tunnel
which
runs
for
half
a
mile
and
more
through
the
heart
of
the
mountain
slope
leaving
the
tunnel
the
line
continues
along
the
slope
then
gradually
descends
towards
souillac
two
or
three
miles
from
that
little
station
which
is
a
junction
the
line
runs
alongside
the
highroad
to
salignac
skirts
for
a
brief
distance
the
corrèze
one
of
the
largest
tributaries
on
the
right
bank
of
the
dordogne
and
then
plunges
into
the
heart
of
lot
torrential
winter
rains
had
seriously
affected
the
railway
embankment
particularly
near
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
a
succession
of
heavy
storms
in
the
early
part
of
december
had
so
greatly
weakened
the
ballast
that
the
chief
engineers
of
the
company
had
been
hastily
summoned
to
the
scene
of
the
mischief
the
experts
decided
that
very
important
repairs
were
required
close
to
the
souillac
end
of
the
tunnel
it
was
necessary
to
put
in
a
complete
system
of
drainage
with
underground
pipes
through
which
the
water
that
came
down
from
the
mountain
could
escape
between
the
ballast
and
the
side
of
the
rock
and
so
pass
underneath
the
permanent
way
the
sleepers
too
had
been
loosened
by
the
bad
weather
and
some
of
them
had
perished
so
much
that
the
chairs
were
no
longer
fast
a
matter
which
was
all
the
more
serious
because
the
line
described
a
very
sharp
curve
at
that
precise
spot
gangs
of
navvies
had
been
hurriedly
requisitioned
but
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
an
exceptional
rate
of
wages
was
paid
a
local
strike
had
broken
out
and
for
some
days
all
work
was
stopped
gradually
however
moderate
counsels
prevailed
and
for
over
a
week
now
nearly
all
the
men
had
taken
up
their
tools
again
nevertheless
for
a
month
past
these
various
circumstances
had
resulted
in
all
the
trains
running
between
brives
and
cahors
being
regularly
half
an
hour
late
further
in
view
of
the
dangerous
state
of
the
line
all
engine
drivers
coming
from
brives
had
received
orders
to
stop
their
trains
two
hundred
yards
from
the
end
of
the
tunnel
and
all
drivers
coming
from
cahors
to
stop
their
trains
five
hundred
yards
before
the
entrance
to
the
tunnel
so
that
should
a
train
appear
while
any
work
was
going
on
which
rendered
it
dangerous
to
pass
it
could
wait
until
the
work
was
completed
the
order
was
also
issued
with
the
primary
object
of
preventing
the
workers
on
the
line
from
being
taken
by
surprise
day
was
just
breaking
this
grey
december
morning
when
the
gang
of
navvies
set
to
work
under
a
foreman
fixing
on
the
down
line
the
new
sleepers
which
had
been
brought
up
the
day
before
suddenly
a
shrill
whistle
was
heard
and
in
the
gaping
black
mouth
of
the
tunnel
the
light
of
two
lamps
became
visible
a
train
bound
for
cahors
had
stopped
in
accordance
with
orders
and
was
calling
for
permission
to
pass
the
foreman
ranged
his
men
on
either
side
of
the
down
line
and
walked
to
a
small
cabin
erected
at
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
where
he
pulled
the
so
as
to
show
the
green
light
thereby
authorising
the
train
to
proceed
on
its
way
there
was
a
second
short
sharp
whistle
heavy
puffs
escaped
from
the
engine
and
belching
forth
a
dense
volume
of
black
smoke
it
slowly
emerged
from
the
tunnel
followed
by
a
long
train
of
carriages
the
windows
of
which
were
frosted
all
over
by
the
cold
temperature
outside
a
man
approached
the
cabin
allotted
to
the
in
charge
of
that
section
of
the
line
in
which
the
tunnel
was
included
i
suppose
this
is
the
train
due
at
verrières
at
he
said
carelessly
yes
the
answered
but
it
late
for
the
clock
down
there
in
the
valley
struck
seven
several
minutes
ago
the
train
had
gone
by
the
three
red
lamps
fastened
at
the
end
of
it
were
already
lost
in
the
morning
mist
the
man
who
spoke
to
the
was
no
other
than
françois
paul
the
tramp
who
had
been
discharged
by
the
magistrate
installed
at
the
château
of
beaulieu
at
precisely
the
same
time
the
day
before
after
a
brief
examination
in
spite
of
the
deep
wrinkle
furrowed
in
his
brow
the
man
seemed
to
make
an
effort
to
appear
friendly
and
to
want
to
carry
on
the
conversation
there
are
many
people
in
this
morning
train
he
remarked
specially
in
the
carriages
the
appeared
in
no
wise
unwilling
to
postpone
for
a
few
moments
his
tiring
and
chilly
underground
patrol
he
put
down
his
pick
before
answering
well
that
not
surprising
is
it
people
who
are
rich
enough
to
travel
always
come
by
the
express
which
gets
to
brives
at
i
see
said
françois
paul
that
reasonable
and
more
practical
for
travellers
to
brives
or
cahors
but
what
about
the
people
who
want
to
get
out
at
gourdon
or
souillac
or
verrières
or
any
of
the
small
stations
where
the
express
does
stop
i
do
know
said
the
but
i
suppose
they
have
to
get
out
at
brives
or
cahors
and
drive
or
else
travel
by
the
day
trains
which
are
fast
to
brives
and
slow
afterwards
françois
paul
did
not
press
the
matter
he
lit
a
pipe
and
breathed
upon
his
benumbed
fingers
hard
times
these
and
no
mistake
the
seemed
sorry
for
him
i
do
suppose
you
an
independent
gentleman
but
why
do
you
try
to
get
taken
on
here
he
suggested
they
want
hands
here
oh
do
they
that
the
fact
this
is
the
foreman
coming
along
now
would
you
like
me
to
speak
to
him
for
you
no
hurry
replied
françois
paul
i
not
saying
no
but
i
should
like
to
see
what
sort
of
work
it
is
they
doing
here
it
might
not
suit
me
i
shall
still
have
time
to
get
a
couple
of
words
with
him
and
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
the
tramp
slowly
walked
along
the
embankment
away
from
the
the
foreman
met
and
passed
him
and
came
up
to
the
at
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
well
michu
how
goes
it
with
you
still
got
the
old
complaint
middling
boss
the
worthy
fellow
answered
just
keeping
up
you
know
and
how
yourself
and
the
work
when
shall
you
finish
i
know
if
you
know
it
but
these
trains
stopping
regularly
in
my
section
give
me
an
extra
lot
of
work
how
that
the
foreman
enquired
in
surprise
the
engine
drivers
take
advantage
of
the
stop
to
empty
their
and
they
leave
a
great
heap
of
mess
there
in
my
tunnel
which
obliged
to
clear
away
in
the
ordinary
way
they
dump
it
somewhere
else
where
i
do
know
but
not
in
my
tunnel
and
that
all
i
care
about
the
foreman
laughed
you
a
good
michu
if
i
were
you
i
would
ask
the
company
to
give
me
another
man
or
two
and
do
you
suppose
the
company
would
michu
retorted
by
the
way
that
poor
devil
who
is
going
along
there
shivering
with
cold
and
hunger
was
grumbling
to
me
just
now
and
i
advised
him
to
ask
you
to
take
him
on
what
do
you
think
he
said
why
that
he
would
have
a
look
at
the
work
first
and
off
he
went
it
a
fact
michu
that
it
mighty
difficult
to
come
across
people
who
mean
business
nowadays
it
quite
true
that
i
want
more
hands
but
if
that
chap
does
ask
me
to
engage
him
in
another
minute
i
kick
him
out
the
embankment
is
not
public
property
and
i
do
trust
these
rascals
who
are
for
ever
coming
and
going
among
the
workmen
to
see
what
mischief
they
can
make
i
go
and
cast
an
eye
over
the
bolts
and
things
for
there
are
all
sorts
of
vagrants
about
the
neighbourhood
just
now
and
criminals
too
said
old
michu
i
suppose
you
have
heard
of
the
murder
up
at
the
château
of
beaulieu
rather
my
men
are
talking
of
nothing
else
but
you
are
right
michu
i
will
get
a
closer
look
at
all
strangers
and
at
your
friend
in
particular
the
foreman
stopped
abruptly
he
had
been
examining
the
foot
of
the
embankment
and
was
standing
quite
still
watching
the
followed
his
glance
and
also
stood
fixed
after
a
few
moments
silence
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
in
the
of
the
valley
they
had
seen
the
outline
of
a
gendarme
he
was
on
foot
and
appeared
to
be
looking
for
somebody
while
making
no
attempt
to
remain
unseen
himself
good
whispered
michu
that
sergeant
doucet
i
know
him
by
his
stripes
they
say
the
murder
was
not
committed
by
anyone
belonging
to
this
part
of
the
country
everybody
was
fond
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
look
look
the
foreman
broke
in
pointing
to
the
gendarme
who
was
slowly
climbing
up
the
embankment
it
looks
as
if
the
sergeant
were
making
for
the
gentleman
who
was
looking
for
work
just
now
and
hoped
he
would
not
find
it
the
sergeant
got
a
word
for
him
eh
what
that
might
be
said
michu
after
a
moment
further
watching
that
chap
has
a
villainous
ugly
face
one
can
tell
from
the
way
he
dressed
that
he
do
belong
to
our
parts
the
two
men
waited
with
utmost
interest
to
see
what
was
going
to
happen
sergeant
doucet
reached
the
top
of
the
embankment
at
last
and
hurried
past
the
navvies
who
stopped
their
work
to
stare
inquisitively
after
the
representative
of
authority
fifty
yards
beyond
them
françois
paul
wrapped
in
thought
was
walking
slowly
down
towards
the
station
of
verrières
hearing
the
sound
of
steps
behind
him
he
turned
when
he
saw
the
sergeant
he
frowned
he
glanced
rapidly
about
him
and
saw
that
while
he
was
alone
with
the
gendarme
so
that
no
one
could
overhear
what
they
said
however
loudly
they
might
speak
they
were
yet
in
such
a
position
that
every
sign
and
movement
they
made
would
be
perfectly
visible
to
whoever
might
watch
them
and
as
the
gendarme
paused
a
few
paces
from
him
and
remarkable
fact
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
bringing
his
hand
to
his
cap
in
salute
the
mysterious
tramp
rapped
out
i
thought
i
said
no
one
was
to
disturb
me
sergeant
the
sergeant
took
a
pace
forward
i
beg
your
pardon
inspector
but
i
have
important
news
for
you
for
this
françois
paul
whom
the
sergeant
thus
respectfully
addressed
as
inspector
was
no
other
than
an
officer
of
the
secret
police
who
had
been
sent
down
to
beaulieu
the
day
before
from
in
paris
he
was
no
ordinary
officer
as
if
havard
had
had
an
idea
that
the
langrune
affair
would
prove
to
be
puzzling
and
complicated
he
had
singled
out
the
very
best
of
his
detectives
the
most
expert
inspector
of
them
all
juve
it
was
juve
who
for
the
last
hours
had
been
prowling
about
the
château
of
beaulieu
disguised
as
a
tramp
and
had
had
himself
arrested
with
bouzille
that
he
might
prosecute
his
own
investigations
without
raising
the
slightest
suspicion
as
to
his
real
identity
juve
made
a
face
expressive
of
his
vexation
at
the
attitude
of
the
sergeant
do
pay
attention
he
said
low
we
are
being
watched
if
i
must
go
back
with
you
pretend
to
arrest
me
slip
the
handcuffs
on
me
i
beg
your
pardon
inspector
i
do
like
to
the
gendarme
answered
for
all
reply
juve
turned
his
back
on
him
look
here
he
said
i
will
take
a
step
or
two
forward
as
if
i
meant
to
run
away
then
you
must
put
your
hand
on
my
shoulder
roughly
and
i
will
stumble
when
i
do
slip
the
bracelets
on
from
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
the
the
foreman
and
the
navvies
all
followed
with
their
eyes
the
unintelligible
conversation
passing
between
the
gendarme
and
the
tramp
a
hundred
yards
away
suddenly
they
saw
the
man
try
to
get
off
and
the
sergeant
seize
him
almost
simultaneously
a
few
minutes
later
the
individual
with
his
hands
linked
together
in
front
of
him
was
obediently
descending
the
steep
slope
of
the
embankment
by
the
gendarme
side
and
then
the
two
men
disappeared
behind
a
clump
of
trees
i
understand
why
that
chap
was
not
very
keen
on
getting
taken
on
here
said
the
foreman
his
conscience
was
none
too
easy
as
they
walked
briskly
in
the
direction
of
beaulieu
juve
asked
the
sergeant
what
has
happened
at
the
château
then
they
know
who
the
murderer
is
inspector
the
sergeant
answered
little
mlle
thérèse
vi
fantômas
it
is
death
hurrying
back
towards
the
château
with
the
sergeant
juve
ran
into
de
presles
outside
the
park
gate
the
magistrate
had
just
arrived
from
brives
in
a
which
he
had
commandeered
for
his
personal
use
during
the
last
few
days
well
said
juve
in
his
quiet
measured
tones
have
you
heard
the
news
and
as
the
magistrate
looked
at
him
in
surprise
he
went
on
i
gather
from
your
expression
that
you
have
not
well
sir
if
you
will
kindly
fill
up
a
warrant
we
will
arrest
charles
rambert
juve
briefly
repeated
to
the
magistrate
what
the
sergeant
had
reported
to
him
and
the
sergeant
added
a
few
further
details
the
three
men
had
now
reached
the
foot
of
the
steps
before
the
house
and
were
about
to
go
up
when
the
door
of
the
château
was
opened
and
dollon
appeared
he
hurried
towards
them
with
unkempt
hair
and
haggard
face
and
excitedly
exclaimed
did
you
meet
the
ramberts
where
are
they
where
are
they
the
magistrate
who
was
bewildered
by
what
juve
had
told
him
was
trying
to
form
a
coherent
idea
of
the
whole
sequence
of
events
but
the
detective
realised
the
situation
at
once
and
turned
to
the
sergeant
the
bird
has
flown
he
said
the
sergeant
threw
up
his
hands
in
dismay
inside
the
hall
juve
and
de
presles
ordered
dollon
to
give
them
an
exact
account
of
the
discovery
made
by
thérèse
in
the
course
of
the
previous
night
well
gentlemen
said
the
old
fellow
who
was
greatly
upset
by
the
discovery
of
the
murderer
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
when
i
got
to
the
château
early
this
morning
i
found
the
two
old
servants
marie
and
louise
entirely
occupied
attending
to
the
young
mistress
marie
slept
in
an
adjoining
room
to
hers
last
night
and
was
awakened
about
five
by
the
poor
child
inarticulate
cries
mlle
thérèse
was
bathed
in
perspiration
her
face
was
all
drawn
and
there
were
dark
rings
under
her
eyes
she
was
sleeping
badly
and
evidently
having
a
dreadful
nightmare
she
half
woke
up
several
times
and
muttered
some
unintelligible
words
to
marie
who
thought
that
it
was
the
result
of
but
about
six
just
as
i
arrived
mlle
thérèse
really
woke
up
and
bursting
into
a
fit
of
sobbing
and
crying
repeated
the
names
of
her
grandmother
and
the
ramberts
and
the
baronne
de
vibray
she
kept
on
saying
murderer
the
murderer
and
making
all
sorts
of
signs
of
terror
but
we
were
not
able
to
get
from
her
a
clear
statement
of
what
it
was
all
about
i
felt
her
pulse
and
found
she
was
very
feverish
and
louise
prepared
a
cooling
drink
which
she
persuaded
her
to
take
in
about
twenty
minutes
it
was
then
nearly
six
mlle
thérèse
quietened
down
and
managed
to
tell
us
what
she
had
heard
during
the
night
and
the
dreadful
interview
and
conversation
between
rambert
and
his
son
which
she
had
seen
and
overheard
what
did
you
do
then
enquired
de
presles
i
was
dreadfully
upset
myself
sir
and
i
sent
jean
the
coachman
to
to
fetch
the
doctor
and
also
to
let
sergeant
doucet
know
sergeant
doucet
got
here
first
i
told
him
all
i
knew
and
then
i
went
upstairs
with
the
doctor
to
see
mlle
thérèse
the
magistrate
turned
to
the
and
questioned
him
directly
dollon
told
me
his
story
the
sergeant
replied
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
report
to
juve
who
i
knew
was
not
far
from
the
château
on
his
way
to
verrières
juve
told
me
last
night
that
he
meant
to
explore
that
part
in
the
early
morning
i
left
morand
on
duty
at
the
entrance
to
the
château
with
orders
to
prevent
either
of
the
ramberts
from
leaving
and
morand
did
not
see
them
going
away
the
magistrate
asked
juve
had
already
divined
what
had
happened
and
replied
for
the
sergeant
morand
did
not
see
them
go
out
for
the
obvious
reason
that
they
had
left
long
before
in
the
middle
of
the
night
directly
after
their
altercation
in
a
word
before
mlle
thérèse
woke
up
he
turned
to
the
sergeant
what
has
been
done
since
then
nothing
inspector
well
sergeant
said
juve
i
imagine
his
worship
will
order
you
to
send
out
your
men
at
once
after
the
runaways
as
a
matter
of
courtesy
he
glanced
at
the
magistrate
as
if
asking
for
his
approval
but
he
only
did
so
out
of
politeness
for
he
took
it
for
granted
of
course
said
the
magistrate
please
do
so
at
once
the
sergeant
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
the
hall
where
is
mlle
thérèse
de
presles
asked
dollon
who
was
standing
nervously
apart
she
is
sleeping
quietly
just
now
sir
said
the
steward
coming
forward
the
doctor
is
with
her
and
would
rather
she
were
not
disturbed
if
you
have
no
objection
very
well
said
the
magistrate
leave
us
please
and
dollon
also
went
away
juve
and
de
presles
looked
at
one
another
the
magistrate
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
so
it
is
finished
he
remarked
so
this
charles
rambert
is
the
culprit
juve
shook
his
head
charles
rambert
well
he
ought
to
be
the
culprit
why
that
reservation
enquired
the
magistrate
i
say
to
be
for
all
the
circumstances
point
to
that
conclusion
and
yet
in
my
bones
i
do
believe
he
is
surely
the
presumptions
of
his
guilt
his
or
at
least
his
silence
in
face
of
his
father
formal
accusation
may
make
us
sure
he
is
said
de
presles
there
are
some
presumptions
in
favour
of
his
innocence
too
juve
replied
but
with
a
slight
hesitation
the
magistrate
pressed
his
point
your
investigations
formally
demonstrated
the
fact
that
the
crime
was
committed
by
some
person
who
was
inside
the
house
possibly
said
juve
but
not
certainly
the
probabilities
do
not
allow
us
to
assert
it
as
a
fact
explain
yourself
not
so
fast
sir
juve
replied
and
getting
up
he
added
there
is
nothing
for
us
to
do
here
sir
shall
we
go
up
to
the
room
charles
rambert
occupied
de
presles
followed
the
detective
and
the
two
men
went
into
the
room
which
was
as
plainly
furnished
as
that
of
any
young
girl
the
magistrate
installed
himself
comfortably
in
an
easy
chair
and
lighted
a
cigar
while
juve
walked
up
and
down
scrutinising
everything
with
quick
sharp
glances
and
began
to
talk
i
said
so
fast
just
now
sir
and
i
will
tell
you
why
in
my
opinion
there
are
two
preliminary
points
in
this
affair
which
it
is
important
to
clear
up
the
nature
of
the
crime
and
the
motive
which
can
have
actuated
the
criminal
let
us
take
up
these
two
points
and
first
of
all
ask
ourselves
how
the
murder
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
ought
to
be
in
the
technical
sense
the
first
conclusion
which
must
be
impressed
upon
the
mind
of
any
observant
person
who
has
visited
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
examined
the
corpse
of
the
victim
is
that
this
murder
must
be
placed
in
the
category
of
crapulous
crimes
the
murderer
seems
to
have
left
the
implicit
mark
of
his
character
upon
his
victim
the
very
violence
of
the
blows
dealt
shows
that
he
is
a
man
of
the
lower
orders
a
typical
criminal
a
professional
what
do
you
deduce
that
from
de
presles
enquired
simply
from
the
nature
of
the
wound
you
saw
it
as
i
did
mme
de
langrune
throat
was
almost
entirely
severed
by
the
blade
of
some
cutting
instrument
the
breadth
and
depth
of
the
wound
absolutely
prove
that
it
was
not
made
with
one
stroke
the
murderer
must
have
gone
amok
and
dealt
several
blows
have
gone
on
striking
even
when
death
had
finished
his
work
or
at
least
was
quite
inevitable
that
shows
clearly
that
the
murderer
belongs
to
a
class
of
individuals
who
feel
no
repugnance
for
their
horrid
work
but
who
kill
without
horror
and
even
without
excitement
again
the
nature
of
the
wound
shows
that
the
murderer
is
a
strong
man
you
no
doubt
know
that
weak
men
with
feeble
muscles
strike
by
choice
that
is
to
say
with
a
pointed
weapon
and
aiming
at
a
vital
organ
whereas
powerful
murderers
have
a
predilection
for
blows
dealt
and
for
broad
ghastly
wounds
besides
that
is
only
following
a
natural
law
a
weak
man
finesses
with
death
tries
to
make
sure
of
it
at
some
precise
point
penetrating
the
heart
or
severing
an
artery
a
brutal
man
does
not
care
where
he
hits
but
trusts
to
his
own
brute
strength
to
achieve
his
purpose
we
have
next
to
determine
the
sort
of
weapon
with
which
the
murder
was
committed
we
have
not
got
it
at
any
rate
up
to
the
present
i
have
given
orders
for
the
drains
to
be
emptied
and
the
pond
to
be
dragged
and
the
shrubberies
to
be
searched
but
whether
our
search
is
crowned
with
success
or
not
i
am
convinced
that
the
instrument
was
a
knife
one
of
those
common
knives
with
a
catch
lock
that
apaches
always
carry
if
the
murderer
had
had
a
weapon
whose
point
was
its
principal
danger
he
would
have
stabbed
and
stabbed
to
the
heart
instead
of
cutting
but
he
used
the
edge
the
part
of
a
knife
that
is
most
habitually
used
and
he
actually
cut
when
the
first
wound
was
made
he
did
not
strike
anywhere
else
but
continued
working
away
at
the
wound
and
enlarging
it
it
is
a
point
of
capital
importance
that
this
murder
was
committed
with
a
knife
not
with
a
dagger
or
stiletto
and
therefore
this
is
a
crapulous
crime
and
what
conclusion
do
you
draw
from
the
fact
that
the
crime
is
a
crapulous
one
the
magistrate
proceeded
to
enquire
merely
that
it
can
not
have
been
committed
by
charles
rambert
juve
answered
very
gravely
he
is
a
young
man
who
has
been
well
brought
up
he
comes
of
very
good
stock
and
his
age
makes
it
most
improbable
that
he
can
be
a
professional
criminal
obviously
obviously
murmured
the
magistrate
not
a
little
embarrassed
by
the
keen
logic
of
the
detective
and
now
let
us
consider
the
motive
or
motives
of
the
crime
juve
continued
why
did
the
man
commit
this
murder
doubtless
for
purposes
of
robbery
said
the
magistrate
what
did
he
want
to
steal
juve
retorted
as
a
matter
of
fact
mme
de
langrune
diamond
rings
and
watch
and
purse
were
all
found
on
her
table
in
full
view
of
everybody
in
the
drawers
that
had
been
broken
open
i
found
other
jewels
over
twenty
pounds
in
gold
and
silver
and
three
in
a
what
is
your
view
sir
of
a
crapulous
robber
who
sees
valuables
like
that
within
his
reach
and
who
does
not
take
them
it
is
certainly
surprising
the
magistrate
admitted
very
surprising
and
goes
to
show
that
although
the
crime
in
itself
is
a
common
sordid
one
the
criminal
may
have
had
higher
or
at
any
rate
different
aspirations
from
those
which
would
lead
an
ordinary
ruffian
to
commit
murder
for
the
sake
of
robbery
the
age
and
social
position
and
personality
of
mme
de
langrune
make
it
very
unlikely
that
she
had
enemies
or
was
the
object
of
vengeance
and
therefore
if
she
was
got
rid
of
it
was
very
likely
that
she
might
be
robbed
but
robbed
of
what
was
there
something
more
important
than
money
or
jewels
to
be
got
i
frankly
admit
that
although
i
put
the
question
i
am
at
a
loss
how
to
answer
it
obviously
murmured
the
magistrate
again
still
more
puzzled
by
all
these
logical
deductions
juve
proceeded
with
the
development
of
his
ideas
and
now
suppose
we
are
face
to
face
with
a
crime
committed
without
any
motive
as
a
result
of
some
morbid
impulse
a
by
no
means
uncommon
occurrence
monomania
or
temporary
insanity
in
that
case
although
in
consequence
of
the
crapulous
nature
of
the
crime
i
had
previously
dismissed
the
very
serious
presumption
of
guilt
attaching
to
young
rambert
i
should
be
inclined
to
reconsider
my
opinion
and
think
it
possible
that
he
might
be
the
culprit
we
know
very
little
about
the
young
fellow
from
the
physiological
point
of
view
in
fact
we
do
know
him
at
all
but
it
seems
that
his
family
is
not
altogether
normal
and
i
understand
that
his
mother
mental
condition
is
precarious
if
for
a
moment
we
regard
charles
rambert
as
a
hysterical
subject
we
can
associate
him
with
the
murder
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
without
thereby
destroying
our
case
that
the
crime
is
a
crapulous
one
for
a
man
of
only
medium
physical
strength
when
suffering
from
an
attack
of
mental
alienation
has
his
muscular
power
increased
at
least
tenfold
during
his
paroxysms
under
such
influence
as
that
charles
rambert
might
have
committed
murder
with
all
the
fierce
brutality
of
a
giant
but
i
shall
soon
be
in
possession
of
absolutely
accurate
knowledge
as
to
the
muscular
strength
of
the
murderer
juve
proceeded
quite
lately
bertillon
invented
a
marvellous
dynamometer
which
enables
us
not
only
to
ascertain
what
kind
of
lever
has
been
used
to
force
a
lock
or
a
piece
of
furniture
but
also
to
determine
the
exact
strength
of
the
individual
who
used
the
tools
i
have
taken
samples
of
the
wood
from
the
broken
drawer
and
i
shall
soon
have
exact
information
that
will
be
immensely
important
de
presles
agreed
even
if
it
does
away
with
our
present
certainty
of
charles
rambert
guilt
we
shall
be
able
to
find
out
whether
the
murder
was
committed
by
any
other
occupant
of
the
house
still
assuming
that
it
was
committed
by
some
member
of
the
household
with
regard
to
that
said
juve
we
can
proceed
with
our
method
of
deduction
and
eliminate
from
our
field
of
observation
everybody
who
has
a
good
alibi
or
other
defence
it
will
be
so
much
ground
cleared
for
my
own
part
i
find
it
impossible
to
suspect
the
two
old
maidservants
louise
and
marie
the
tramps
whom
we
have
detained
and
subsequently
released
are
too
elementary
people
to
have
been
capable
of
devising
the
minute
precautions
which
demonstrate
the
subtle
cleverness
of
the
man
who
murdered
the
marquise
then
there
is
dollon
but
i
imagine
you
will
agree
with
me
in
thinking
that
his
alibi
removes
him
from
suspicion
more
especially
as
the
medical
evidence
proves
that
the
murder
was
committed
during
the
night
between
two
and
three
only
etienne
rambert
is
left
the
magistrate
put
in
and
about
nine
that
evening
he
left
the
station
in
the
slow
train
which
reaches
verrières
at
he
spent
the
whole
night
in
the
train
for
he
certainly
arrived
by
that
one
he
could
not
have
a
better
alibi
not
possibly
juve
replied
so
we
need
only
trouble
ourselves
with
charles
rambert
and
warming
up
to
the
subject
the
detective
proceeded
to
pile
up
a
crushing
indictment
against
the
young
man
the
crime
was
committed
so
quietly
that
not
the
faintest
sound
was
heard
therefore
the
murderer
was
in
the
house
he
went
to
the
marquise
room
and
announced
his
arrival
by
a
cautious
tap
on
the
door
the
marquise
then
opened
the
door
to
him
and
was
not
surprised
to
see
him
for
she
knew
him
quite
well
he
went
into
her
room
with
her
and
oh
come
come
de
presles
broke
in
you
are
romancing
now
juve
you
forget
that
the
bedroom
door
was
forced
the
best
proof
of
that
being
the
bolt
which
was
found
wrenched
away
and
hanging
literally
at
the
end
of
the
screws
i
was
expecting
you
to
say
that
sir
said
juve
with
a
smile
but
before
i
reply
i
should
like
to
show
you
something
rather
quaint
he
led
the
way
across
the
passage
and
went
into
the
bedroom
of
the
marquise
where
order
had
now
been
restored
the
dead
body
had
been
removed
to
the
library
which
was
transformed
into
a
and
two
nuns
were
watching
over
it
there
have
a
good
look
at
this
bolt
he
said
to
de
presles
is
there
anything
unusual
about
it
no
said
the
magistrate
yes
there
is
said
juve
the
is
out
as
when
the
bolt
is
fastened
but
the
socket
into
which
the
slips
to
fasten
the
door
to
the
wall
is
intact
if
the
bolt
really
had
been
forced
the
socket
would
have
been
wrenched
away
too
juve
next
asked
de
presles
to
look
closely
at
the
screws
that
were
wrenched
halfway
out
of
the
door
do
you
see
anything
on
those
the
magistrate
pointed
to
their
heads
there
are
tiny
scratches
on
them
he
said
rather
hesitatingly
for
in
his
inmost
heart
he
knew
the
detective
real
superiority
over
himself
and
from
those
i
must
infer
that
the
screws
have
not
been
wrenched
out
by
the
pressure
exerted
on
the
bolt
but
really
unscrewed
and
therefore
and
therefore
juve
broke
in
this
is
a
mere
blind
from
which
we
may
certainly
draw
the
conclusion
that
the
murderer
wished
to
make
us
believe
that
the
door
was
forced
whereas
in
reality
it
was
opened
to
him
by
the
marquise
therefore
the
murderer
was
personally
known
to
her
the
murderer
was
personally
known
to
her
he
repeated
now
i
should
like
to
remind
you
of
young
charles
rambert
equivocal
behaviour
in
the
course
of
the
evening
that
preceded
the
crime
it
struck
president
bonnet
and
shocked
the
priest
i
also
recall
his
hereditary
antecedents
his
mothers
insanity
and
finally
juve
broke
off
abruptly
and
unceremoniously
dragged
the
magistrate
out
of
the
room
and
into
charles
rambert
bedroom
he
hurried
into
the
adjoining
went
down
on
his
knees
on
the
floor
and
laid
a
finger
on
the
middle
of
the
that
was
laid
over
the
boards
what
do
you
see
there
sir
he
demanded
the
magistrate
adjusted
his
eyeglass
and
looking
at
the
place
indicated
by
the
detective
saw
a
little
black
stain
he
wetted
his
finger
rubbed
it
on
the
spot
and
then
holding
up
his
hand
observed
that
the
tip
of
his
finger
was
stained
red
it
is
blood
he
muttered
yes
blood
said
juve
and
i
gather
from
this
that
the
story
of
the
towel
which
rambert
senior
found
among
his
things
and
the
sight
of
which
so
greatly
impressed
mlle
thérèse
was
not
an
invention
on
that
young
lady
part
but
really
existed
and
it
forms
the
most
damning
evidence
possible
against
the
young
man
he
obviously
washed
his
hands
after
the
crime
in
the
water
from
the
tap
over
this
basin
here
but
one
drop
of
blood
falling
on
the
towel
and
dripping
on
to
the
floor
has
been
enough
to
give
him
away
the
magistrate
nodded
it
is
conclusive
he
said
you
have
just
proved
to
demonstration
juve
that
charles
rambert
is
the
guilty
party
it
is
beyond
argument
it
is
conclusive
conclusive
there
were
a
couple
of
seconds
of
silence
and
then
juve
suddenly
said
no
no
he
repeated
it
is
quite
true
that
we
can
adduce
perfectly
logical
arguments
to
show
that
the
murder
was
committed
by
some
member
of
the
household
and
that
therefore
charles
rambert
is
the
only
possible
culprit
but
we
can
adduce
equally
logical
arguments
to
show
that
the
crime
was
committed
by
some
person
who
got
in
from
outside
there
is
nothing
to
prove
that
he
did
not
walk
into
the
house
through
the
front
door
the
door
was
locked
said
the
magistrate
that
nothing
said
juve
with
a
laugh
do
forget
that
there
such
a
thing
as
a
real
safety
lock
nowadays
since
all
locks
can
be
opened
with
an
outside
key
if
i
had
found
one
of
the
good
catch
locks
on
the
door
such
as
they
used
to
make
years
ago
i
should
have
said
to
you
nobody
got
in
because
the
only
way
to
get
through
a
door
fastened
with
one
of
those
locks
is
to
break
the
door
down
but
here
we
have
a
lock
that
can
be
opened
with
a
key
now
the
key
does
not
exist
of
which
one
can
not
get
an
impression
and
there
is
not
such
a
thing
as
an
impression
from
which
one
can
not
manufacture
a
false
key
the
murderer
could
easily
have
got
into
the
house
with
a
duplicate
key
the
magistrate
raised
a
further
objection
if
the
murderer
had
got
in
from
outside
he
would
inevitably
have
left
some
traces
round
about
the
château
but
there
are
any
yes
there
are
juve
retorted
first
of
all
there
is
this
piece
of
an
ordnance
map
which
i
found
yesterday
between
the
château
and
the
embankment
he
took
it
from
his
pocket
as
he
spoke
it
is
an
odd
coincidence
that
this
scrap
shows
the
neighbourhood
of
the
château
of
beaulieu
that
does
prove
anything
said
the
magistrate
to
find
a
piece
of
a
map
of
our
district
in
our
district
is
the
most
natural
thing
possible
now
if
you
were
to
discover
the
rest
of
this
map
in
possession
then
you
may
rest
assured
that
i
shall
try
to
do
so
with
the
least
possible
delay
said
juve
gently
but
this
is
not
the
only
argument
i
have
to
support
my
theory
this
morning
when
i
was
walking
near
the
embankment
i
found
some
very
suspicious
footprints
it
is
true
there
are
any
number
of
footprints
near
the
end
of
the
verrières
tunnel
where
the
navvies
are
at
work
but
at
the
other
end
of
the
tunnel
where
there
is
no
occasion
for
anyone
to
pass
by
i
found
that
the
earth
of
the
embankment
which
was
crisp
with
the
frost
had
been
disturbed
showing
that
someone
had
clambered
up
the
embankment
the
tips
of
his
shoes
had
been
driven
into
the
earth
and
i
could
see
distinctly
where
his
feet
had
been
placed
but
unfortunately
the
soil
there
is
so
dry
that
the
footprints
were
too
faint
for
me
to
hope
to
be
able
to
identify
the
maker
of
them
but
the
fact
remains
that
someone
did
climb
up
the
embankment
someone
who
was
making
for
the
railway
the
magistrate
did
not
seem
to
be
impressed
by
juve
discovery
and
pray
what
conclusion
do
you
think
ought
to
be
drawn
from
that
he
enquired
juve
sat
down
in
an
easy
chair
threw
back
his
head
and
closed
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
about
to
indulge
in
a
long
soliloquy
and
began
to
express
his
thoughts
aloud
suppose
we
were
to
combine
the
two
hypotheses
into
one
to
wit
that
the
murderer
was
in
the
château
prior
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
crime
and
left
the
château
directly
it
was
accomplished
what
should
you
say
sir
of
a
criminal
completing
his
deed
then
hurrying
over
the
couple
of
miles
that
separate
beaulieu
from
the
railway
and
catching
a
passing
train
and
on
his
way
climbing
the
embankment
at
the
spot
where
i
found
the
footprints
i
mentioned
i
should
say
the
magistrate
replied
that
you
ca
jump
into
a
moving
train
as
you
can
into
a
passing
tram
and
further
that
at
night
none
but
express
trains
run
between
brives
and
cahors
all
right
said
juve
i
will
merely
point
out
that
owing
to
the
work
on
the
line
at
present
all
trains
have
stopped
at
the
beginning
of
the
tunnel
for
the
last
two
months
if
the
murderer
had
planned
to
escape
in
that
way
he
might
very
well
have
been
aware
of
this
regular
stoppage
the
magistrates
confidence
was
a
little
shaken
by
these
new
deductions
on
the
part
of
the
detective
but
he
submitted
yet
another
objection
we
have
not
found
any
traces
round
about
the
château
strictly
speaking
no
we
have
not
juve
admitted
but
it
is
clear
that
if
the
murderer
walked
on
the
grass
and
he
probably
did
so
he
walked
on
it
during
the
night
that
is
to
say
before
the
morning
dew
now
everybody
knows
that
when
the
dew
rises
in
the
early
morning
grass
that
has
been
bent
down
by
any
passing
man
or
animal
stands
up
again
in
its
original
position
thereby
destroying
all
traces
so
if
the
murderer
did
walk
on
the
lawn
when
he
was
getting
away
nobody
could
tell
that
he
had
done
so
nevertheless
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
window
of
the
room
where
the
murder
was
committed
i
have
observed
not
exactly
footprints
but
signs
that
the
earth
has
been
disturbed
at
that
spot
i
imagine
that
if
i
were
to
jump
out
of
a
first
floor
window
on
to
the
soft
surface
of
a
lawn
and
wanted
to
efface
the
marks
of
my
boots
i
should
smooth
the
earth
and
the
grass
around
them
in
just
the
same
way
that
the
little
piece
of
lawn
i
speak
of
seems
to
have
been
smoothed
i
should
like
to
have
a
look
at
that
said
de
presles
well
there
no
difficulty
about
it
juve
replied
come
along
the
two
men
hurried
down
the
staircase
and
out
of
the
house
when
they
reached
the
patch
of
grass
which
the
inspector
said
had
been
made
up
they
crouched
down
and
scrutinised
it
closely
just
by
the
side
of
the
grass
even
overhanging
it
a
little
a
large
rhubarb
plant
outspread
its
thick
dentelated
leaves
almost
parallel
with
the
soil
juve
happened
to
glance
casually
at
the
nearest
leaf
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
gratification
gad
here
something
interesting
and
he
drew
the
attention
to
some
little
pilules
of
earth
with
which
the
plant
was
peppered
what
is
that
enquired
de
presles
earth
said
juve
who
had
swept
the
top
of
the
leaf
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
ordinary
earth
like
the
rest
ten
inches
below
on
the
grass
well
what
about
it
said
the
puzzled
magistrate
well
said
juve
with
a
smile
i
imagine
that
ordinary
earth
or
any
kind
of
earth
has
no
power
to
move
of
its
own
volition
much
less
to
jump
up
ten
inches
into
the
air
and
settle
on
the
top
of
a
leaf
even
a
rhubarb
leaf
so
i
conclude
that
since
this
earth
did
not
get
here
by
itself
it
was
brought
here
how
that
is
very
simple
somebody
has
jumped
on
to
the
grass
there
de
presles
he
has
removed
the
marks
of
his
feet
by
smoothing
the
earth
with
his
hands
the
earth
soiled
his
hands
and
he
rubbed
one
against
the
other
quite
mechanically
the
earth
which
was
on
his
hands
fell
off
in
little
balls
on
to
the
rhubarb
leaf
and
remained
there
for
us
to
discover
and
so
it
is
certain
this
is
one
proof
more
that
even
if
the
murderer
did
not
get
in
from
outside
he
did
at
any
rate
take
to
flight
after
he
had
committed
the
crime
so
it
ca
be
charles
rambert
after
all
said
the
magistrate
it
to
be
charles
rambert
was
juve
baffling
reply
the
magistrate
waxed
irritable
my
dear
sir
your
everlasting
contradictions
end
by
being
rather
absurd
you
have
hardly
finished
building
up
one
laborious
theory
before
you
start
knocking
it
down
again
i
fail
to
understand
you
juve
smiled
at
de
presles
sudden
irritability
but
quickly
became
grave
again
i
am
anxious
not
to
be
led
away
by
any
preconceived
opinion
i
put
the
hypothesis
that
so
and
so
is
guilty
and
examine
all
the
arguments
in
support
of
that
theory
then
i
submit
that
the
crime
was
committed
by
somebody
else
and
proceed
in
the
same
way
my
method
certainly
has
the
objection
that
it
confronts
every
argument
with
a
diametrically
opposite
one
but
we
are
not
concerned
with
establishing
any
one
case
in
preference
to
another
it
is
the
truth
and
nothing
else
that
we
have
to
discover
and
that
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
in
spite
of
the
overwhelming
circumstantial
evidence
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
has
run
away
charles
rambert
is
innocent
charles
rambert
is
the
culprit
sir
juve
replied
brightly
if
he
were
not
whom
else
could
we
possibly
suspect
the
detective
placidity
and
his
perpetual
exasperated
de
presles
he
held
his
tongue
and
was
silently
revolving
the
case
in
his
mind
when
juve
made
yet
one
more
suggestion
there
is
one
final
hypothesis
which
i
feel
obliged
to
put
before
you
do
you
realise
sir
that
this
is
a
typical
fantômas
crime
de
presles
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
the
detective
pronounced
this
name
upon
my
word
juve
i
should
never
have
expected
you
to
invoke
fantômas
why
fantômas
is
the
too
obvious
subterfuge
the
cheapest
device
for
investing
a
case
with
mock
honours
between
you
and
me
you
know
perfectly
well
that
fantômas
is
merely
a
legal
fiction
a
joke
fantômas
has
no
existence
in
fact
juve
stopped
in
his
stride
he
paused
a
moment
before
replying
then
spoke
in
a
restrained
voice
but
with
an
emphasis
on
his
words
that
always
marked
him
when
he
spoke
in
all
seriousness
you
are
wrong
to
laugh
sir
very
wrong
you
are
a
magistrate
and
i
am
only
a
humble
detective
inspector
but
you
have
three
or
four
experience
perhaps
less
while
i
have
fifteen
years
work
behind
me
i
know
that
fantômas
does
exist
and
i
do
anything
but
laugh
when
i
suspect
his
intervention
in
a
case
de
presles
could
hardly
conceal
his
surprise
and
juve
went
on
no
one
has
ever
said
of
me
sir
that
i
was
a
coward
i
have
looked
death
in
the
eyes
i
have
often
hunted
and
arrested
criminals
who
would
not
have
had
the
least
hesitation
in
doing
away
with
me
there
are
whole
gangs
of
rascals
who
have
vowed
my
death
all
manner
of
horrible
revenges
threaten
me
for
all
that
i
have
the
most
complete
indifference
but
when
people
talk
to
me
of
fantômas
when
i
fancy
that
i
can
detect
the
intervention
of
that
genius
of
crime
in
any
case
then
de
presles
i
am
in
a
funk
i
tell
you
frankly
i
am
in
a
funk
i
am
frightened
because
fantômas
is
a
being
against
whom
it
is
idle
to
use
ordinary
weapons
because
he
has
been
able
to
hide
his
identity
and
elude
all
pursuit
for
years
because
his
daring
is
boundless
and
his
power
unmeasurable
because
he
is
everywhere
and
nowhere
at
once
and
if
he
has
had
a
hand
in
this
affair
i
am
not
even
sure
that
he
is
not
listening
to
me
now
and
finally
de
presles
because
every
one
whom
i
have
known
to
attack
fantômas
my
friends
my
colleagues
my
superior
officers
have
one
and
all
one
and
all
sir
been
beaten
in
the
fight
fantômas
does
exist
i
know
but
who
is
he
a
man
can
brave
a
danger
he
can
measure
but
he
trembles
when
confronted
with
a
peril
he
suspects
but
can
not
see
but
this
fantômas
is
not
a
devil
the
magistrate
broke
in
testily
he
is
a
man
like
you
and
me
you
are
right
sir
in
saying
he
is
a
man
but
i
repeat
the
man
is
a
genius
i
do
know
whether
he
works
alone
or
whether
he
is
the
head
of
a
gang
of
criminals
i
know
nothing
of
his
life
i
know
nothing
of
his
object
in
no
single
case
yet
has
it
been
possible
to
determine
the
exact
part
he
has
taken
he
seems
to
possess
the
extraordinary
gift
of
being
able
to
slay
and
leave
no
trace
you
do
see
him
you
divine
his
presence
you
do
hear
him
you
have
a
presentiment
of
him
if
fantômas
is
mixed
up
in
this
present
affair
i
do
know
if
we
ever
shall
succeed
in
clearing
it
up
de
presles
was
impressed
in
spite
of
himself
by
the
earnestness
but
i
suppose
you
are
not
recommending
me
to
drop
the
enquiry
are
you
juve
the
detective
forced
a
laugh
that
did
not
ring
quite
true
come
come
sir
he
answered
i
told
you
just
now
that
i
was
frightened
but
i
never
said
i
was
a
coward
you
may
be
quite
sure
i
shall
do
my
duty
to
the
very
end
when
i
first
began
and
that
was
not
yesterday
nor
yet
the
day
before
to
realise
the
importance
and
the
power
of
this
fantômas
i
took
an
oath
sir
that
some
day
i
would
discover
his
identity
and
effect
his
arrest
fantômas
is
an
enemy
of
society
you
say
i
prefer
to
regard
him
first
and
foremost
as
my
own
personal
enemy
i
have
declared
war
on
him
and
i
am
ready
to
lose
my
skin
in
the
war
if
necessary
but
by
god
i
have
his
juve
ceased
de
presles
also
was
silent
but
the
magistrate
was
still
sceptical
despite
the
detective
strange
utterance
and
presently
he
could
not
refrain
from
making
a
gentle
protest
and
appeal
do
please
bring
in
a
verdict
against
someone
juve
for
really
i
would
rather
believe
that
your
fantômas
is
a
creation
of
the
imagination
juve
shrugged
his
shoulders
seemed
to
be
arriving
at
a
mighty
decision
and
began
you
are
quite
right
sir
to
require
me
to
draw
some
definite
conclusion
even
if
you
are
not
right
in
denying
the
existence
of
fantômas
so
i
make
the
assertion
that
the
murderer
is
the
sound
of
hurrying
steps
behind
them
made
both
men
turn
round
a
postman
hot
and
perspiring
was
hurrying
to
the
château
he
had
a
telegram
in
his
hand
does
either
of
you
gentlemen
know
m
juve
he
asked
my
name
is
juve
said
the
detective
and
he
took
the
telegram
and
tore
the
envelope
open
he
glanced
through
it
and
then
handed
it
to
the
magistrate
please
read
that
sir
he
said
the
telegram
was
from
the
criminal
investigation
department
and
ran
as
follows
return
immediately
to
paris
are
convinced
that
extraordinary
crime
lies
behind
disappearance
of
lord
beltham

vii
the
criminal
investigation

does

live
here
please
mme
doulenques
the
concierge
at
no
rue
lévert
looked
at
the
enquirer
and
saw
a
tall
dark
man
with
a
heavy
moustache
wearing
a
soft
hat
and
a
tightly
buttoned
overcoat
the
collar
of
which
was
turned
up
to
his
ears
gurn
is
away
sir
she
answered
he
has
been
away
for
some
little
time
i
know
said
the
stranger
but
still
i
want
to
go
up
to
his
rooms
if
you
will
kindly
go
with
me
you
want
the
concierge
began
in
surprise
and
doubt
oh
i
know
of
course
you
are
the
man
from
the
company
come
for
his
luggage
wait
a
bit
what
is
the
name
of
that
company
something
funny
an
english
name
i
fancy
the
woman
left
the
door
which
she
had
been
holding
just
ajar
and
went
to
the
back
of
her
lodge
she
looked
through
the
where
she
kept
the
tenants
letters
ready
sorted
and
picked
out
a
soiled
printed
circular
addressed
to
gurn
she
was
busy
putting
on
her
spectacles
when
the
stranger
drew
near
and
from
over
her
shoulder
got
a
glimpse
of
the
name
for
which
she
was
looking
he
drew
back
again
noiselessly
and
said
quietly
i
have
come
from
the
south
steamship
company
yes
that
it
said
the
concierge
laboriously
spelling
out
the
words
the
south
what
you
said
i
can
never
pronounce
those
names
rue
is
it
that
it
replied
the
man
in
the
soft
hat
in
pleasant
measured
tones
well
it
very
plain
that
you
do
bustle
much
in
your
place
the
concierge
remarked
i
been
expecting
you
to
come
for
things
for
nearly
three
weeks
he
told
me
you
would
come
a
few
days
after
he
had
gone
however
that
your
business
mme
doulenques
cast
a
mechanical
glance
through
the
window
that
looked
on
to
the
street
and
then
surveyed
the
stranger
from
top
to
toe
he
seemed
to
be
much
too
well
dressed
to
be
a
mere
porter
but
you
have
got
any
handcart
or
truck
she
exclaimed
you
not
thinking
of
carrying
the
trunks
on
your
shoulder
are
you
why
there
are
at
least
three
or
four
of
them
and
heavy
the
stranger
paused
before
answering
as
though
he
found
it
necessary
to
weigh
each
word
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
merely
wanted
to
get
an
idea
of
the
size
of
the
luggage
he
said
quietly
will
you
show
me
the
things
if
i
must
i
must
said
the
concierge
with
a
heavy
sigh
come
up
with
me
it
the
fifth
floor
and
as
she
climbed
the
stairs
she
grumbled
it
a
pity
you
did
come
when
i
was
doing
my
work
i
should
have
had
to
climb
a
hundred
stairs
a
second
time
then
it
counts
up
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
i
not
so
young
as
i
was
the
stranger
followed
her
up
the
stairs
murmuring
monosyllabic
sympathy
and
regulating
his
pace
by
hers
arrived
at
the
fifth
floor
the
concierge
drew
a
key
from
her
pocket
and
opened
the
door
of
the
flat
it
was
a
small
modest
place
but
quite
prettily
decorated
the
door
on
the
landing
opened
into
a
tiny
sort
of
anteroom
from
which
one
passed
into
a
front
room
furnished
with
little
but
a
round
table
and
a
few
beyond
this
was
a
bedroom
almost
filled
by
the
large
bed
which
was
the
first
thing
one
saw
on
entering
and
on
the
right
there
was
yet
another
room
probably
a
little
office
both
the
first
room
which
was
a
kind
of
general
living
room
and
the
bedroom
had
wide
windows
overlooking
gardens
as
far
as
one
could
see
an
advantage
of
the
flat
was
that
it
had
nothing
opposite
so
that
the
occupant
could
move
about
with
the
windows
open
if
he
liked
and
yet
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
inquisitiveness
of
neighbours
the
rooms
had
been
shut
up
for
several
days
since
the
tenant
had
gone
away
indeed
and
there
was
a
stuffy
smell
about
them
mingled
with
a
strong
smell
of
chemicals
i
must
air
the
place
the
concierge
muttered
or
else
gurn
be
pleased
when
he
comes
back
he
always
says
he
is
too
hot
and
breathe
in
paris
so
he
does
not
live
here
regularly
said
the
stranger
scanning
the
place
curiously
as
he
spoke
oh
no
sir
the
concierge
answered
gurn
is
a
kind
of
commercial
traveller
and
is
often
away
sometimes
for
a
month
or
six
weeks
together
and
the
gossiping
woman
was
beginning
a
long
and
incoherent
story
when
the
stranger
interrupted
her
pointing
to
a
photograph
of
a
young
woman
he
had
noticed
on
the
mantelpiece
is
that
mme
gurn
gurn
is
a
bachelor
mme
doulenques
replied
i
ca
fancy
him
married
with
his
roaming
kind
of
life
just
a
little
friend
of
his
eh
said
the
man
in
the
soft
hat
with
a
wink
and
a
meaning
smile
oh
no
said
the
concierge
shaking
her
head
that
photograph
is
not
a
bit
like
her
so
you
know
her
then
i
do
and
i
do
that
to
say
when
gurn
is
in
paris
he
often
has
visits
from
a
lady
in
the
afternoon
a
very
fashionable
lady
i
can
tell
you
not
the
sort
that
one
often
sees
in
this
quarter
why
the
woman
who
comes
is
a
society
lady
i
am
sure
she
always
has
her
veil
down
and
passes
by
my
lodge
ever
so
fast
and
never
has
any
conversation
with
me
free
with
her
money
too
it
very
seldom
she
does
not
give
me
something
when
she
comes
the
stranger
seemed
to
find
the
concierge
communications
very
interesting
but
they
did
not
interrupt
his
mental
inventory
of
the
room
in
other
words
your
tenant
does
not
keep
too
sharp
an
eye
on
his
money
he
suggested
no
indeed
the
rent
is
always
paid
in
advance
and
sometimes
gurn
even
pays
two
terms
in
advance
because
he
says
he
never
can
tell
if
his
business
wo
be
keeping
him
away
when
the
rent
falls
due
just
then
a
deep
voice
called
up
the
staircase
concierge
gurn
have
you
any
one
of
that
name
in
the
house
come
up
to
the
fifth
floor
the
concierge
called
back
to
the
man
i
am
in
his
rooms
now
and
she
went
back
into
the
flat
here
somebody
else
for
gurn
she
exclaimed
does
he
have
many
visitors
the
stranger
enquired
hardly
any
sir
that
why
i
so
surprised
two
men
appeared
their
blue
blouses
and
caps
proclaimed
them
to
be
porters
the
concierge
turned
to
the
man
in
the
soft
hat
i
suppose
these
are
your
men
come
to
fetch
the
trunks
the
stranger
made
a
slight
grimace
seemed
to
hesitate
and
finally
made
up
his
mind
to
remain
silent
rather
surprised
to
see
that
the
three
men
did
not
seem
to
be
acquainted
with
each
other
the
concierge
was
about
to
ask
what
it
meant
when
one
of
the
porters
addressed
her
curtly
we
come
from
the
south
steamship
company
for
four
boxes
from
gurn
place
are
those
the
ones
and
taking
no
notice
of
the
visitor
in
the
room
the
man
pointed
to
two
large
trunks
and
two
small
boxes
which
were
placed
in
a
corner
of
the
room
but
are
you
three
all
together
enquired
mme
doulenques
visibly
uneasy
the
stranger
still
remained
silent
but
the
first
porter
replied
at
once
no
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
gentleman
get
on
to
it
mate
no
time
to
waste
anticipating
their
action
the
concierge
got
instinctively
between
the
porters
and
the
luggage
so
too
did
the
man
in
the
soft
hat
pardon
said
he
politely
but
peremptorily
please
take
nothing
away
one
of
the
porters
drew
a
crumpled
and
dirty
memorandum
book
from
his
pocket
and
turned
over
the
pages
wetting
his
thumb
every
time
he
looked
at
it
attentively
and
then
spoke
there
no
mistake
this
is
where
we
were
told
to
come
and
again
he
signed
to
his
mate
let
get
on
with
it
the
concierge
was
puzzled
she
looked
first
at
the
mysterious
stranger
who
was
as
quiet
and
silent
as
ever
and
then
at
the
porters
who
were
beginning
to
be
irritated
by
these
incomprehensible
complications
mme
doulenques
mistrust
waxed
greater
and
she
sincerely
regretted
being
alone
on
the
fifth
floor
with
these
strangers
for
the
other
occupants
of
this
floor
had
gone
off
to
their
daily
work
long
ago
suddenly
she
escaped
from
the
room
and
called
shrilly
down
the
stairs
madame
aurore
madame
aurore
the
man
in
the
soft
hat
rushed
after
her
seized
her
gently
but
firmly
by
the
arm
and
led
her
back
into
the
room
i
beg
you
madame
make
no
noise
do
not
call
out
he
said
in
a
low
tone
everything
will
be
all
right
i
only
ask
you
not
to
create
a
disturbance
but
the
concierge
was
thoroughly
alarmed
by
the
really
odd
behaviour
of
all
these
men
and
again
screamed
at
the
top
of
her
voice
help
police
the
first
porter
was
exasperated
it
unfortunate
to
be
taken
for
thieves
he
said
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
look
here
auguste
just
run
down
to
the
corner
of
the
street
and
bring
back
a
gendarme
the
gentleman
can
explain
to
the
concierge
in
his
presence
and
then
we
shall
be
at
liberty
to
get
on
with
our
job
auguste
hastened
to
obey
and
several
tense
moments
passed
during
which
not
a
single
word
was
exchanged
between
the
three
people
who
were
left
together
then
heavy
steps
were
heard
and
auguste
reappeared
with
a
gendarme
the
latter
came
swaggering
into
the
room
with
a
majestic
air
and
solemnly
and
pompously
enquired
now
then
what
all
this
about
at
sight
of
the
officer
every
countenance
cleared
the
concierge
ceased
to
tremble
the
porter
lost
his
air
of
suspicion
both
were
beginning
to
explain
to
the
representative
of
authority
when
the
man
in
the
soft
hat
waved
them
aside
stepped
up
to
the
guardian
of
the
peace
and
looking
him
straight
in
the
eyes
said
criminal
investigation
department
inspector
juve
the
gendarme
who
was
quite
unprepared
for
this
announcement
stepped
back
a
pace
and
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
man
who
addressed
him
then
suddenly
raised
his
hand
to
his
and
came
to
attention
beg
pardon
inspector
i
did
recognise
you
juve
and
you
have
been
in
this
division
a
long
time
too
he
turned
angrily
to
the
foremost
porter
step
forward
please
and
let
have
no
nonsense
juve
who
had
thus
disclosed
his
identity
as
a
detective
smiled
seeing
that
the
gendarme
assumed
that
the
south
steamship
company
porter
was
a
thief
that
all
right
he
said
leave
the
man
alone
he
done
no
harm
then
who
am
i
to
arrest
the
puzzled
gendarme
asked
the
concierge
broke
in
to
explain
she
had
been
much
impressed
by
the
style
and
title
of
the
stranger
if
the
gentleman
had
told
me
where
he
came
from
i
would
certainly
never
have
allowed
anyone
to
go
for
a
gendarme
inspector
juve
smiled
if
i
had
told
you
who
i
was
just
now
madame
when
you
were
quite
naturally
so
upset
you
would
not
have
believed
me
you
would
have
continued
to
call
out
now
i
am
particularly
anxious
to
avoid
any
scandal
or
noise
at
the
present
moment
i
rely
on
your
discretion
he
turned
to
the
two
porters
who
were
dumb
with
amazement
and
could
make
nothing
of
the
affair
as
for
you
my
good
fellows
i
must
ask
you
to
leave
your
other
work
and
go
back
at
once
to
your
office
in
the
rue
and
tell
your
manager
what
is
his
name
wooland
one
of
the
men
replied
good
tell
wooland
that
i
want
to
see
him
here
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
and
tell
him
to
bring
with
him
all
the
papers
he
has
that
refer
to
gurn
and
not
a
word
to
anyone
about
all
this
please
especially
in
this
neighbourhood
take
my
message
to
your
manager
and
that
all
the
porters
had
left
hurriedly
for
the
rue
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
went
by
the
detective
had
requested
the
concierge
to
ask
the
madame
aurore
to
whom
she
had
previously
appealed
so
loudly
for
help
to
take
her
place
temporarily
in
the
lodge
juve
kept
mme
doulenques
upstairs
with
him
partly
to
get
information
from
her
and
partly
to
prevent
her
from
gossiping
downstairs
while
he
was
opening
drawers
and
ransacking
furniture
and
plunging
his
hand
into
presses
and
cupboards
juve
asked
the
concierge
to
describe
this
tenant
of
hers
gurn
in
whom
he
appeared
to
be
so
deeply
interested
he
is
a
rather
fair
man
the
concierge
told
him
medium
height
stout
build
and
clean
shaven
like
an
englishman
there
is
nothing
particular
about
him
he
is
like
lots
of
other
people
this
very
vague
description
was
hardly
satisfactory
the
detective
told
the
policeman
to
unscrew
the
lock
on
a
locked
trunk
and
gave
him
a
small
which
he
had
found
in
the
kitchen
then
he
turned
again
to
mme
doulenques
who
was
standing
stiffly
against
the
wall
severely
silent
you
told
me
that
gurn
had
a
lady
friend
when
used
he
to
see
her
pretty
often
when
he
was
in
paris
and
always
in
the
afternoon
sometimes
they
were
together
till
six
or
seven
and
once
or
twice
the
lady
did
not
come
down
before
seven
used
they
to
leave
the
house
together
no
sir
did
the
lady
ever
stay
the
night
here
never
sir
yes
evidently
a
married
woman
murmured
the
detective
as
if
speaking
to
himself
mme
doulenques
made
a
vague
gesture
to
show
her
ignorance
on
the
point
i
ca
tell
you
anything
about
that
sir
very
well
said
the
detective
kindly
pass
me
that
coat
behind
you
the
concierge
obediently
took
down
a
coat
from
a
hook
and
handed
it
to
juve
who
searched
it
quickly
looked
it
all
over
and
then
found
a
label
sewn
on
the
inside
of
the
collar
it
bore
the
one
word
good
said
he
in
an
undertone
i
thought
as
much
then
he
looked
at
the
buttons
these
were
stamped
on
the
under
side
with
the
name
the
gendarme
understood
what
the
detective
was
about
and
he
too
examined
the
clothes
in
the
first
trunk
which
he
had
just
opened
there
is
nothing
to
show
where
these
things
came
from
sir
he
remarked
the
name
of
the
maker
is
not
on
them
that
all
right
said
juve
open
the
other
trunk
while
the
gendarme
was
busy
forcing
this
second
lock
juve
went
for
a
moment
into
the
kitchen
and
came
back
holding
a
rather
heavy
copper
mallet
with
an
iron
handle
which
he
had
found
there
he
was
looking
at
this
mallet
with
some
curiosity
balancing
and
weighing
it
in
his
hands
when
a
sudden
exclamation
of
fright
from
the
gendarme
drew
his
eyes
to
the
trunk
the
lid
of
which
had
just
been
thrown
back
juve
did
not
lose
all
his
professional
impassivity
but
even
he
leaped
forward
like
a
flash
swept
the
gendarme
to
one
side
and
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
the
open
box
a
horrid
spectacle
met
his
eyes
for
the
trunk
contained
a
corpse
the
moment
mme
doulenques
caught
sight
of
the
ghastly
thing
she
fell
back
into
a
chair
half
fainting
and
there
she
remained
unable
to
move
with
her
body
hunched
forward
and
haggard
eyes
fixed
upon
the
corpse
of
which
she
caught
occasional
glimpses
as
the
movements
of
juve
and
the
gendarme
every
now
and
then
left
the
shocking
thing
within
the
trunk
exposed
to
her
view
yet
there
was
nothing
especially
gruesome
or
repellent
about
the
corpse
it
was
the
body
of
a
man
of
about
fifty
years
of
age
with
a
pronounced
complexion
and
a
lofty
brow
the
height
of
which
was
increased
by
premature
baldness
long
fair
moustaches
drooped
from
the
upper
lip
almost
to
the
top
of
the
chest
the
unfortunate
creature
was
doubled
up
in
the
trunk
with
knees
bent
and
head
forced
down
by
the
weight
of
the
lid
the
body
was
dressed
with
a
certain
fastidiousness
and
it
was
obviously
that
of
a
man
of
fashion
and
distinction
there
was
no
wound
to
be
seen
the
calm
quiet
face
suggested
that
the
victim
had
been
taken
by
surprise
while
in
the
full
vigour
of
life
and
killed
suddenly
and
had
not
been
subjected
to
the
anguish
of
a
fight
for
life
or
to
any
slow
agony
juve
half
turned
to
the
concierge
when
did
you
see
gurn
last
exactly
please
it
is
important
mme
doulenques
babbled
something
unintelligible
and
then
as
the
detective
pressed
her
made
an
effort
to
collect
her
scattered
wits
three
weeks
ago
at
least
sir
yes
three
weeks
exactly
no
one
has
been
here
since
i
will
swear
juve
made
a
sign
to
the
gendarme
who
understood
and
felt
the
body
carefully
quite
stiff
and
hard
sir
he
said
yet
there
is
no
smell
from
it
perhaps
the
cold
juve
shook
his
head
even
severe
cold
could
not
preserve
a
body
in
that
condition
for
three
weeks
and
it
not
cold
now
but
there
is
this
and
he
showed
his
subordinate
a
small
yellowish
stain
just
at
the
opening
of
the
collar
close
to
the
adam
apple
which
in
spite
of
the
comparative
thinness
of
the
body
was
very
much
developed
juve
took
the
corpse
under
the
and
raised
it
gently
wishing
to
examine
it
closely
but
anxious
also
not
to
alter
its
position
on
the
nape
of
the
neck
was
a
large
stain
of
blood
like
a
black
wen
and
as
big
as
a
piece
just
above
the
last
vertebra
of
the
spinal
column
that
the
explanation
the
detective
murmured
and
carefully
replacing
the
body
he
continued
his
investigation
with
quick
clever
hands
he
searched
the
coat
pockets
and
found
the
watch
in
its
proper
place
another
pocket
was
full
of
money
chiefly
small
change
with
a
few
louis
but
juve
looked
in
vain
for
the
which
the
man
had
doubtless
been
in
the
habit
of
carrying
about
with
him
the
probably
containing
some
means
of
identification
the
inspector
merely
grunted
got
up
began
pacing
the
room
and
questioned
the
concierge
did
gurn
have
a
no
sir
she
replied
looking
surprised
why
do
you
ask
oh
for
no
particular
reason
said
the
inspector
with
affected
indifference
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
contemplating
a
large
nickel
pump
that
lay
on
a
a
syringe
holding
perhaps
half
a
pint
like
those
that
chauffeurs
use
he
looked
at
it
steadfastly
for
several
minutes
his
next
question
was
addressed
to
the
gendarme
who
was
still
on
his
knees
by
the
trunk
we
have
found
one
yellow
stain
on
the
neck
you
will
very
likely
find
some
more
have
a
look
at
the
wrists
and
the
calves
of
the
legs
and
the
stomach
but
do
it
carefully
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
body
while
the
gendarme
began
to
obey
his
chief
order
carefully
undoing
the
clothing
on
the
corpse
juve
looked
at
the
concierge
again
who
did
the
work
of
this
flat
i
did
sir
juve
pointed
to
the
velvet
curtain
that
screened
the
door
between
the
little
anteroom
and
the
room
in
which
they
were
how
did
you
come
to
leave
that
curtain
unhooked
at
the
top
without
putting
it
to
rights
mme
doulenques
looked
at
it
it
the
first
time
i
seen
it
like
that
she
said
apologetically
the
curtain
could
not
have
been
unhooked
when
i
did
the
room
last
without
my
noticing
it
anyhow
it
has
been
like
that
long
i
ought
to
say
that
as
gurn
was
seldom
here
i
did
do
the
place
out
thoroughly
very
often
when
did
you
do
it
out
last
quite
a
month
ago
that
is
to
say
gurn
went
away
a
week
after
you
last
cleaned
the
place
up
yes
sir
juve
changed
the
subject
and
pointed
to
the
corpse
tell
me
madame
did
you
know
that
person
the
concierge
fought
down
her
nervousness
and
for
the
first
time
looked
at
the
unfortunate
victim
with
a
steady
gaze
i
have
never
seen
him
before
she
said
with
a
little
shudder
and
so
when
that
gentleman
came
up
here
you
did
not
notice
him
said
the
inspector
gently
no
i
did
not
notice
him
she
declared
and
then
went
on
as
if
answering
some
question
which
occurred
to
her
own
mind
and
i
wonder
i
did
for
people
very
seldom
enquired
for
gurn
of
course
when
the
lady
was
with
him
gurn
was
not
at
home
to
anybody
this
this
dead
man
must
have
come
straight
up
himself
juve
nodded
and
was
about
to
continue
his
questioning
when
the
bell
rang
open
the
door
said
juve
to
the
concierge
and
he
followed
her
to
the
entrance
of
the
flat
partly
fearing
to
find
some
intruder
there
partly
hoping
to
see
some
unexpected
person
whose
arrival
might
throw
a
little
light
upon
the
situation
at
the
opened
door
juve
saw
a
young
man
of
about
an
obvious
englishman
with
clear
eyes
and
hair
with
an
accent
that
further
made
his
british
origin
unmistakable
the
visitor
introduced
himself
i
am
wooland
manager
of
the
paris
branch
of
the
south
steamship
company
it
seems
that
i
am
wanted
at
gurn
flat
on
the
fifth
floor
of
this
house
by
desire
of
the
police
juve
came
forward
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
putting
yourself
to
this
inconvenience
sir
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
juve
an
inspector
from
the
criminal
investigation
department
please
come
in
solemn
and
impassive
wooland
entered
the
room
a
side
glance
suddenly
showed
him
the
open
trunk
and
the
dead
body
but
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
moved
wooland
came
of
a
good
stock
and
had
all
that
admirable
which
is
the
strength
of
the
powerful
race
he
looked
at
the
inspector
in
somewhat
haughty
silence
waiting
for
him
to
begin
will
you
kindly
let
me
know
sir
the
instructions
your
firm
had
with
regard
to
the
forwarding
of
the
baggage
which
you
sent
for
to
this
flat
of
gurn
this
morning
four
days
ago
inspector
said
the
young
man
on
the
of
december
to
be
precise
the
london
mail
brought
us
a
letter
in
which
lord
beltham
who
had
been
a
client
of
ours
for
several
years
instructed
us
to
collect
on
the
of
december
that
is
four
articles
marked
and
from
gurn
apartments
rue
lévert
he
informed
us
that
the
concierge
had
orders
to
allow
us
to
take
them
away
to
what
address
were
you
to
despatch
them
our
client
instructed
us
to
forward
the
trunks
by
the
first
steamer
to
johannesburg
where
he
would
send
for
them
we
were
to
send
two
invoices
with
the
goods
as
usual
the
third
invoice
was
to
be
sent
to
london
box
charing
cross
post
office
juve
made
a
note
of
box
charing
cross
in
his
addressed
to
what
name
or
initials
simply
beltham
good
there
are
no
other
documents
relating
to
the
matter
no
i
have
nothing
else
said
wooland
the
young
fellow
relapsed
into
his
usual
impassive
silence
juve
watched
him
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
said
you
must
have
heard
the
various
rumours
current
in
paris
three
weeks
ago
sir
about
lord
beltham
he
was
a
very
personage
in
society
suddenly
he
disappeared
his
wife
left
nothing
undone
to
give
the
matter
the
widest
publicity
were
you
not
rather
surprised
when
you
received
a
letter
from
lord
beltham
four
days
ago
wooland
was
not
disconcerted
by
the
rather
embarrassing
question
of
course
i
had
heard
of
lord
beltham
disappearance
but
it
was
not
for
me
to
form
any
official
opinion
about
it
i
am
a
business
man
sir
not
a
detective
lord
beltham
might
have
disappeared
voluntarily
or
the
reverse
i
was
not
asked
to
say
which
when
i
got
his
letter
i
simply
decided
to
carry
out
the
orders
it
contained
i
should
do
the
same
again
in
similar
circumstances
are
you
satisfied
that
the
order
was
sent
by
lord
beltham
i
have
already
told
you
sir
that
lord
beltham
had
been
a
client
of
ours
for
several
years
we
have
had
many
similar
dealings
with
him
this
last
order
which
we
received
from
him
appeared
to
be
entirely
above
suspicion
identical
in
form
and
in
terms
with
the
previous
letters
we
had
had
from
him
he
took
a
letter
out
of
his
and
handed
it
to
juve
here
is
the
order
sir
if
you
think
proper
you
can
compare
it
with
similar
documents
filed
in
our
office
in
the
rue
and
as
juve
was
silent
wooland
with
the
utmost
dignity
enquired
is
there
any
further
occasion
for
me
to
remain
here
thank
you
sir
no
juve
replied
wooland
made
an
almost
imperceptible
bow
and
was
on
the
point
of
withdrawing
when
the
detective
stayed
him
once
more
wooland
did
you
know
lord
beltham
no
sir
lord
beltham
always
sent
us
his
orders
by
letter
once
or
twice
he
has
spoken
to
us
over
the
telephone
but
he
never
came
to
our
office
and
i
have
never
been
to
his
house
thank
you
very
much
said
juve
and
with
a
bow
wooland
withdrew
with
meticulous
care
juve
replaced
every
article
which
he
had
moved
during
his
investigations
he
carefully
shut
the
lid
of
the
trunk
thus
hiding
the
unhappy
corpse
from
the
curious
eyes
of
the
gendarme
and
the
still
terrified
mme
doulenques
then
he
leisurely
buttoned
his
overcoat
and
spoke
to
the
gendarme
stay
here
until
i
send
a
man
to
relieve
you
i
am
going
to
your
superintendent
now
at
the
door
he
called
the
concierge
will
you
kindly
go
down
before
me
madame
return
to
your
lodge
and
please
do
not
say
a
word
about
what
has
happened
to
anyone
whatever
you
can
trust
me
sir
the
worthy
creature
murmured
and
juve
walked
slowly
away
from
the
house
with
head
bowed
in
thought
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
the
body
in
the
trunk
was
that
of
lord
beltham
juve
knew
the
englishman
quite
well
but
who
was
the
murderer
everything
points
to
gurn
juve
thought
and
yet
would
an
ordinary
murderer
have
dared
to
commit
such
a
crime
as
this
am
i
letting
my
imagination
run
away
with
me
again
i
do
know
but
it
seems
to
me
that
about
this
murder
committed
in
the
very
middle
of
paris
in
a
crowded
house
where
yet
nobody
heard
or
suspected
anything
there
is
an
audacity
a
certainty
of
impunity
and
above
all
a
multiplicity
of
precautions
that
are
typical
of
the
fantômas
manner
he
clenched
his
fists
and
an
evil
smile
curled
his
lips
as
he
repeated
like
a
threat
the
name
of
that
terrible
and
most
mysterious
criminal
of
whose
hellish
influence
he
seemed
to
be
conscious
yet
once
again
fantômas
fantômas
did
fantômas
really
commit
this
murder
and
if
he
did
shall
i
ever
succeed
in
throwing
light
upon
this
new
mystery
and
learning
the
secret
of
that
tragic
room
viii
a
dreadful
confession
while
juve
was
devoting
his
marvellous
skill
and
incomparable
daring
to
the
elucidation
of
the
new
case
with
which
the
criminal
investigation
department
had
entrusted
him
in
paris
things
were
marching
at
beaulieu
where
the
whole
machinery
of
the
law
was
being
set
in
motion
for
the
discovery
and
arrest
of
charles
rambert
with
a
mighty
clatter
and
racket
bouzille
came
down
the
slope
and
stopped
before
old
mother
chiquard
cottage
he
arrived
in
his
own
equipage
and
an
extraordinary
one
it
was
bouzille
was
mounted
upon
a
tricycle
of
prehistoric
design
with
two
large
wheels
behind
and
a
small
steering
wheel
in
front
and
a
rusty
from
which
all
the
plating
was
worn
off
the
solid
rubber
tyres
which
once
had
adorned
the
machine
had
worn
out
long
ago
and
were
now
replaced
by
twine
twisted
round
the
felloes
of
the
wheels
this
was
for
ever
fraying
away
and
the
wheels
were
fringed
with
a
veritable
of
string
bouzille
must
have
picked
up
this
impossible
machine
for
an
old
song
at
some
local
market
unless
perhaps
some
charitable
person
gave
it
to
him
simply
to
get
rid
of
it
he
styled
this
tricycle
his
engine
and
it
was
by
no
means
the
whole
of
his
equipage
attached
to
the
tricycle
by
a
stout
rope
was
a
kind
of
wicker
perambulator
on
four
wheels
which
he
called
his
because
he
stored
away
in
it
all
the
bits
of
rag
he
picked
up
on
his
journeys
and
also
his
very
primitive
bedding
and
the
little
piece
of
waterproof
canvas
under
which
he
often
slept
in
the
open
air
behind
the
was
a
third
vehicle
the
consisting
of
an
old
soap
box
mounted
on
four
solid
wooden
wheels
which
were
fastened
to
the
axles
by
huge
conical
bolts
in
this
he
kept
his
provisions
lumps
of
bread
and
fat
bottles
and
vegetables
all
mixed
up
in
agreeable
confusion
bouzille
made
quite
long
journeys
in
this
train
of
his
and
was
well
known
throughout
the
of
france
often
did
the
astonished
population
see
him
bent
over
his
tricycle
with
his
pack
on
his
back
pedalling
with
extraordinary
rapidity
down
the
hills
while
the
carriages
behind
him
bumped
and
jumped
over
the
inequalities
in
the
surface
of
the
road
until
it
seemed
impossible
that
they
could
retain
their
equilibrium
old
mother
chiquard
had
recognised
the
cause
of
the
racket
the
healthy
life
of
the
country
had
kept
the
old
woman
strong
and
active
in
spite
of
the
years
that
had
passed
over
her
head
and
now
she
came
to
her
door
armed
with
a
broom
and
hailed
the
tramp
in
angry
threatening
tones
so
it
you
is
it
you
thief
you
robber
of
the
poor
it
shocking
the
way
you
spend
your
time
in
evil
doing
what
do
you
want
now
pray
slowly
and
sheepishly
and
with
head
bowed
bouzille
approached
mother
chiquard
nervously
looking
out
for
a
whack
over
the
head
with
the
broom
the
old
lady
held
do
be
cross
he
pleaded
when
he
could
get
in
a
word
i
want
to
come
to
an
arrangement
with
you
mother
chiquard
if
it
can
be
done
that
all
according
said
the
old
woman
eyeing
the
tramp
with
great
mistrust
i
have
much
faith
in
arrangements
with
you
rascals
like
you
always
manage
to
do
honest
folk
mother
chiquard
turned
back
into
her
cottage
it
was
no
weather
for
her
to
stop
out
of
doors
for
a
strong
north
wind
was
blowing
and
that
was
bad
for
her
rheumatism
bouzille
deliberately
followed
her
inside
and
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
him
without
ceremony
he
walked
up
to
the
hearth
where
a
scanty
wood
fire
was
burning
and
put
down
his
pack
so
as
to
be
able
to
rub
his
hands
more
freely
miserable
weather
mother
chiquard
the
obstinate
old
lady
stuck
to
her
one
idea
if
it
is
miserable
to
steal
my
rabbit
this
is
the
finest
weather
that
ever
i
saw
you
make
a
lot
of
fuss
about
a
trifle
the
tramp
protested
especially
since
you
will
be
a
lot
the
better
by
the
arrangement
going
to
suggest
the
notion
calmed
mother
chiquard
a
little
and
she
sat
down
on
a
form
while
bouzille
took
a
seat
upon
the
table
what
do
you
mean
the
old
woman
enquired
well
said
bouzille
i
suppose
your
rabbit
would
have
fetched
a
couple
of
shillings
in
the
market
i
brought
you
two
fowls
that
are
worth
quite
each
and
if
you
will
give
me
some
dinner
at
twelve
i
will
put
in
a
good
morning
work
for
you
mother
chiquard
looked
at
the
clock
upon
the
wall
it
was
eight
the
tramp
proposal
represented
four
hours
work
which
was
not
to
be
despised
but
before
striking
the
bargain
she
insisted
on
seeing
the
fowls
these
were
extracted
from
the
pack
tied
together
by
the
feet
and
half
suffocated
the
unfortunate
creatures
were
not
much
to
look
at
but
they
would
be
cheap
which
was
worth
considering
where
did
you
get
these
fowls
mother
chiquard
asked
more
as
a
matter
of
form
than
anything
else
for
she
was
pretty
sure
they
had
not
been
honestly
come
by
bouzille
put
his
finger
to
his
lip
hush
he
murmured
gently
that
a
secret
between
me
and
the
poultry
well
is
it
a
go
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
old
lady
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
made
up
her
mind
it
a
go
she
said
putting
her
horny
fingers
into
the
man
hard
palm
you
shall
chop
me
some
wood
first
and
then
go
down
to
the
river
for
the
rushes
i
have
put
in
to
soak
they
must
be
well
swollen
by
this
time
bouzille
was
glad
to
have
made
it
up
with
mother
chiquard
and
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
a
good
dinner
at
midday
he
opened
the
cottage
door
and
leisurely
arranged
a
few
logs
within
range
of
the
axe
with
which
he
was
going
to
split
them
mother
chiquard
began
to
throw
down
some
grain
to
the
skinny
and
famished
fowls
that
fluttered
round
her
i
thought
you
were
in
prison
bouzille
she
said
over
stealing
my
rabbit
and
also
over
that
affair
at
the
château
of
beaulieu
oh
those
are
two
quite
different
stories
bouzille
replied
you
must
mix
them
up
together
on
any
account
as
for
the
château
job
every
tramp
in
the
district
has
been
run
in
i
was
copped
by
morand
the
morning
after
the
murder
he
took
me
into
the
kitchen
of
the
château
and
mme
louise
gave
me
something
to
eat
there
was
another
chap
there
with
me
a
man
named
françois
paul
who
does
belong
to
these
parts
between
you
and
me
i
thought
he
was
an
customer
who
might
easily
have
been
the
murderer
but
it
does
do
to
say
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
glad
i
held
my
tongue
because
they
let
him
go
i
heard
no
more
about
it
and
five
days
later
i
went
back
to
brives
to
attend
the
funeral
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
that
was
a
ceremony
if
you
like
the
church
all
lighted
up
and
all
the
nobility
from
the
neighbourhood
present
i
did
lose
my
time
for
i
knew
all
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
and
took
the
best
part
of
sixteen
shillings
and
the
blind
beggar
who
sits
on
the
steps
of
the
church
called
me
all
the
names
he
could
put
his
tongue
to
the
tramp
story
interested
mother
chiquard
mightily
but
her
former
idea
still
dominated
her
mind
so
they
did
punish
you
for
stealing
my
rabbit
well
they
did
and
they
did
said
bouzille
scratching
his
head
morand
who
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
took
me
to
the
at
and
i
was
to
have
gone
next
morning
to
the
court
at
brives
where
i
know
the
sentence
for
stealing
domestic
animals
is
three
weeks
that
would
have
suited
me
all
right
just
now
for
the
prison
at
brives
is
quite
new
and
very
comfortable
but
that
same
night
sergeant
doucet
shoved
another
man
into
the
clink
with
me
at
a
raving
lunatic
who
started
smashing
everything
up
and
tried
to
tear
my
eyes
out
naturally
i
gave
him
as
good
as
i
got
and
the
infernal
row
we
made
brought
in
the
sergeant
i
told
him
the
chap
wanted
to
throttle
me
and
he
was
nonplussed
for
he
could
do
anything
with
the
man
who
was
fairly
mad
and
could
leave
me
alone
there
with
him
so
at
last
the
sergeant
took
me
to
one
side
and
told
me
to
hook
it
and
not
let
him
see
me
again
so
there
it
is
while
he
was
chattering
like
this
bouzille
had
finished
the
job
set
him
by
mother
chiquard
who
meanwhile
had
peeled
some
potatoes
and
poured
the
soup
on
the
bread
he
wiped
his
brow
and
seeing
the
brimming
pot
gave
a
meaning
wink
and
licked
his
tongue
i
make
the
fire
up
mother
chiquard
i
getting
jolly
hungry
so
you
ought
to
be
at
eleven
the
old
woman
replied
yes
we
have
dinner
and
you
can
get
the
rushes
out
afterwards
mother
chiquard
was
the
proud
of
a
little
cottage
that
was
separated
from
the
bank
of
the
dordogne
by
the
high
road
between
martel
and
montvalent
round
the
cottage
she
had
a
small
orchard
and
opposite
through
a
gap
in
the
trees
was
a
view
of
the
yellow
waters
of
the
dordogne
and
the
chain
of
hills
that
stood
up
on
the
far
side
of
the
river
living
here
summer
and
winter
with
her
rabbits
and
her
fowls
mother
chiquard
earned
a
little
money
by
making
baskets
but
she
was
crippled
with
rheumatism
and
was
miserable
every
time
she
had
to
go
down
to
the
river
to
pull
out
the
bundles
of
rushes
that
she
put
there
to
soak
the
work
meant
not
merely
an
hour
paddling
in
mud
up
to
the
knees
but
also
a
fortnight
acute
agony
and
at
least
a
shilling
for
medicine
so
whoever
wanted
to
make
a
friend
of
the
old
woman
only
had
to
volunteer
to
get
the
rushes
out
for
her
as
he
ate
bouzille
told
mother
chiquard
of
his
plans
for
the
coming
spring
yes
he
said
since
i
not
doing
any
time
this
winter
i
going
to
undertake
a
long
journey
he
stopped
munching
for
a
second
and
paused
for
greater
effect
i
am
going
to
paris
mother
chiquard
then
seeing
that
the
old
lady
was
utterly
dumbfounded
by
the
announcement
he
leant
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
looked
at
her
over
his
empty
plate
always
had
one
great
desire
to
see
the
eiffel
tower
that
idea
has
been
running
in
my
head
for
the
last
fifteen
years
well
now
i
going
to
gratify
the
wish
i
hear
you
can
get
a
room
in
paris
for
a
night
and
i
can
manage
that
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
get
there
enquired
the
old
woman
immensely
impressed
by
bouzille
venturesome
plan
that
depends
said
the
tramp
i
must
allow
quite
three
months
with
my
train
of
course
if
i
got
run
in
on
the
way
for
stealing
or
as
a
rogue
and
vagabond
i
could
say
how
long
it
would
take
the
meal
was
over
and
the
old
woman
was
quietly
washing
up
her
few
plates
and
dishes
when
bouzille
who
had
gone
down
to
the
river
to
fetch
the
rushes
suddenly
called
shrilly
to
mother
chiquard
mother
chiquard
mother
chiquard
come
and
look
just
fancy
earned
francs
the
summons
was
so
urgent
and
the
news
so
amazing
that
the
old
lady
left
her
house
and
hurried
across
the
road
to
the
river
bank
she
saw
the
tramp
up
to
his
waist
in
the
water
trying
with
a
long
stick
to
drag
out
of
the
current
a
large
object
which
was
not
identifiable
at
a
first
glance
to
all
her
enquiries
bouzille
answered
with
the
same
delighted
cry
i
have
earned
francs
too
intent
on
bringing
his
fishing
job
to
a
successful
issue
even
to
turn
round
a
few
minutes
later
he
emerged
dripping
from
the
water
towing
a
large
bundle
to
the
safety
of
the
bank
mother
chiquard
drew
nearer
greatly
interested
and
then
recoiled
with
a
shriek
of
horror
bouzille
had
fished
out
a
corpse
it
was
a
ghastly
sight
the
body
of
a
very
young
man
almost
a
boy
with
long
slender
limbs
the
face
was
so
horribly
swollen
and
torn
as
to
be
shapeless
one
leg
was
almost
entirely
torn
from
the
trunk
through
rents
in
the
clothing
strips
of
flesh
were
trailing
blue
and
discoloured
by
their
long
immersion
in
the
water
on
the
shoulders
and
back
of
the
neck
were
bruises
and
stains
of
blood
bouzille
who
was
quite
unaffected
by
the
ghastliness
of
the
object
and
still
kept
up
his
gay
chant
i
have
fished
up
a
body
i
earned
francs
observed
that
there
were
large
splinters
of
wood
rotten
from
long
immersion
sticking
in
some
of
the
wounds
he
stood
up
and
addressed
mother
chiquard
who
white
as
a
sheet
was
watching
him
in
silence
i
see
what
it
is
he
must
have
got
caught
in
some
mill
wheel
what
has
cut
him
up
like
that
mother
chiquard
shook
her
head
uneasily
suppose
it
was
a
murder
that
would
be
an
ugly
business
it
no
good
my
looking
at
him
any
more
said
bouzille
i
recognise
him
he
not
from
the
country
that
sure
the
old
woman
agreed
he
dressed
like
a
gentleman
the
two
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
bouzille
was
not
nearly
so
complacent
as
he
had
been
a
few
minutes
before
the
reward
of
francs
prompted
him
to
go
at
once
to
inform
the
police
the
idea
of
a
crime
suggested
by
the
worthy
woman
disturbed
him
greatly
and
all
the
more
because
he
thought
it
was
well
founded
another
murder
in
the
neighbourhood
would
certainly
vex
the
authorities
and
put
the
police
in
a
bad
temper
bouzille
knew
from
experience
that
the
first
thing
people
do
after
a
tragedy
is
to
arrest
all
the
tramps
and
that
if
the
police
are
at
all
crotchety
they
always
contrive
to
get
the
tramps
sentenced
for
something
else
he
had
had
a
momentary
inclination
to
establish
his
winter
quarters
in
prison
but
since
then
he
had
formed
the
plan
of
going
to
paris
and
liberty
appealed
to
him
more
he
reached
a
sudden
decision
i
punt
him
back
into
the
water
but
mother
chiquard
stayed
him
just
as
he
was
putting
his
idea
into
execution
you
must
suppose
somebody
has
seen
us
already
it
would
land
us
in
no
end
of
trouble
half
an
hour
later
convinced
that
it
was
his
melancholy
duty
bouzille
left
of
his
train
in
mother
chiquard
custody
got
astride
his
prehistoric
tricycle
and
slowly
pedalled
off
towards
new
year
day
is
a
melancholy
and
a
tedious
one
for
everybody
whose
public
or
private
relations
do
not
make
it
an
exceptionally
interesting
one
there
is
the
alteration
in
the
date
for
one
thing
which
is
provocative
of
thought
and
there
is
the
enforced
idleness
for
another
coming
upon
energetic
folk
like
a
temporary
paralysis
and
leaving
them
nothing
but
meditation
wherewith
to
employ
themselves
juve
comfortably
installed
in
his
own
private
study
was
realising
this
just
as
evening
was
falling
on
this
first
of
january
he
was
a
confirmed
bachelor
and
for
several
years
had
lived
in
a
little
flat
on
the
fifth
floor
of
an
old
house
in
the
rue
bonaparte
he
had
not
gone
out
but
though
he
was
resting
he
was
not
idle
for
a
whole
month
past
he
had
been
wholly
engrossed
in
his
attempt
to
solve
the
mystery
surrounding
the
two
cases
on
which
he
was
engaged
the
beltham
case
and
the
langrune
case
and
his
mind
was
leisurely
revolving
round
them
now
as
he
sat
in
his
warm
room
before
a
blazing
wood
fire
and
watched
the
blue
smoke
curl
up
in
rings
towards
the
ceiling
the
two
cases
were
very
dissimilar
and
yet
his
detective
instinct
persuaded
him
that
although
they
differed
in
details
their
conception
and
execution
emanated
not
only
from
one
single
brain
but
also
from
one
hand
he
was
convinced
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
mysterious
and
dangerous
individual
and
that
while
he
himself
was
out
in
the
open
he
was
fighting
a
concealed
and
invisible
adversary
he
strove
to
give
form
and
substance
to
the
adversary
and
the
name
of
fantômas
came
into
his
mind
fantômas
what
might
fantômas
be
doing
now
and
if
he
had
a
real
existence
as
the
detective
most
firmly
believed
how
was
he
spending
new
year
day
a
sharp
ring
at
the
bell
startled
him
from
his
chair
and
not
giving
his
time
to
answer
it
he
went
himself
to
the
door
and
took
from
a
messenger
a
telegram
which
he
hastily
tore
open
and
read
have
found
in
the
dordogne
drowned
body
of
young
man
face
unrecognisable
from
description
possibly
charles
rambert
please
consider
situation
and
wire
course
you
will
take
the
telegram
had
been
handed
in
at
brives
and
was
signed
by
de
presles
something
fresh
at
last
the
detective
muttered
drowned
in
the
dordogne
and
face
unrecognisable
i
wonder
if
it
really
is
charles
rambert
since
etienne
rambert
and
his
son
had
disappeared
so
unaccountably
the
detective
naturally
had
formulated
mentally
several
hypotheses
but
he
had
arrived
at
no
conclusion
which
really
satisfied
his
judgment
but
though
their
flight
had
not
surprised
him
greatly
he
had
been
rather
surprised
that
the
police
had
not
been
able
to
find
any
trace
of
them
for
rightly
or
wrongly
juve
credited
them
with
a
good
deal
of
cleverness
and
power
so
it
was
by
no
means
unreasonable
to
accept
the
death
of
the
fugitives
as
explanation
of
the
failure
of
the
police
to
find
them
however
this
was
a
fresh
development
of
the
case
and
he
was
about
to
draft
a
reply
to
de
presles
when
once
more
the
bell
rang
sharply
this
time
juve
did
not
move
but
listened
while
his
man
spoke
to
the
visitor
it
was
an
absolute
rule
of
juve
never
to
receive
visitors
at
his
flat
if
anyone
wanted
to
see
him
on
business
he
was
to
be
found
almost
every
day
in
his
office
at
about
eleven
in
the
morning
to
a
few
people
he
was
willing
to
give
appointments
at
a
quiet
and
discreet
little
café
in
the
boulevard
but
he
invited
no
one
to
his
own
rooms
except
one
or
two
of
his
own
relations
from
the
country
and
even
they
had
to
be
provided
with
a
password
before
they
could
obtain
admission
so
now
to
all
the
entreaties
of
the
caller
juve
servant
stolidly
replied
with
the
assurance
that
his
master
would
see
no
one
yet
the
visitor
insistence
was
so
great
that
at
last
the
servant
was
prevailed
upon
to
bring
in
his
card
albeit
with
some
fear
as
to
the
consequences
for
himself
but
to
his
extreme
relief
and
surprise
juve
when
he
had
read
the
name
engraved
upon
the
card
said
sharply
bring
him
in
here
at
once
and
in
another
couple
of
seconds
etienne
rambert
was
in
the
room
the
old
gentleman
who
had
fled
so
mysteriously
a
few
days
before
taking
with
him
the
son
over
whom
so
dread
a
charge
was
hanging
bowed
deferentially
to
the
detective
with
the
pitiful
mien
of
one
who
is
crushed
beneath
the
burden
of
misfortune
his
features
were
drawn
his
face
bore
the
stamp
of
deepest
grief
and
in
his
hand
he
held
an
evening
paper
which
in
his
agitation
he
had
crumpled
almost
into
a
ball
tell
me
sir
if
it
is
true
he
said
in
low
trembling
tones
i
have
just
read
that
juve
pointed
to
a
chair
took
the
paper
mechanically
and
smoothing
it
out
read
below
a
large
is
this
a
sequel
to
the
beaulieu
crime
a
story
similar
to
that
he
had
just
gathered
from
de
telegram
juve
contemplated
etienne
rambert
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
without
replying
directly
to
his
visitor
first
question
asked
him
a
question
in
that
quiet
voice
of
his
the
wonderful
indifferent
tonelessness
of
which
concealed
the
least
clue
to
his
inmost
thoughts
why
do
you
come
to
me
sir
to
find
out
sir
the
old
man
answered
to
find
out
what
if
that
poor
drowned
corpse
is
my
son
is
my
poor
charles
it
is
rather
you
who
can
tell
me
sir
said
juve
impassive
as
ever
there
was
a
pause
despite
his
emotion
rambert
seemed
to
be
thinking
deeply
suddenly
he
appeared
to
make
an
important
decision
and
raising
his
eyes
to
the
detective
he
spoke
very
slowly
have
pity
sir
on
a
father
listen
to
me
i
have
a
dreadful
confession
to
make
juve
drew
his
chair
close
to
etienne
rambert
i
am
listening
he
said
gently
and
etienne
rambert
began
his
dreadful
confession
ix
all
for
honour
society
had
mustered
in
force
at
the
cahors
law
courts
where
the
assizes
were
about
to
be
held
hooting
and
antiquated
coaches
drawn
by
pursy
horses
were
arriving
every
minute
bringing
gentry
from
the
great
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
squireens
and
country
people
prosperous
farmers
and
jolly
all
of
them
determined
not
to
miss
the
trial
that
was
causing
such
immense
excitement
because
the
principal
figure
in
it
was
well
known
as
a
friend
of
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
those
parts
and
because
he
was
not
merely
a
witness
nor
even
the
victim
but
actually
the
defendant
in
the
case
although
he
had
been
admitted
to
bail
in
the
interval
by
order
of
the
court
compared
with
those
of
large
towns
this
court
room
at
cahors
was
small
but
it
was
filled
by
a
considerable
and
most
select
crowd
quiet
greetings
and
conversation
were
freely
exchanged
but
there
was
an
air
of
melancholy
about
every
person
present
and
it
was
obvious
that
they
were
drawn
there
by
no
mere
curiosity
or
desire
for
horrid
details
but
by
legitimate
interest
in
the
development
of
great
drama
one
of
the
leading
heroines
in
the
case
was
pointed
out
with
particular
sympathy
that
thérèse
auvernois
over
there
in
the
first
row
the
president
of
the
court
gave
her
that
seat
the
officer
who
took
the
card
of
admission
over
to
querelles
told
me
so
that
where
mme
de
vibray
lives
is
it
yes
she
is
sitting
next
to
thérèse
now
that
pretty
woman
in
grey
since
mme
de
langrune
death
she
has
kept
the
child
with
her
thinking
very
rightly
that
it
would
be
too
painful
for
her
to
be
at
beaulieu
the
family
council
have
appointed
president
bonnet
temporary
guardian
of
thérèse
he
is
that
tall
thin
man
over
there
talking
to
the
steward
dollon
the
baronne
de
vibray
turned
affectionately
to
thérèse
who
was
looking
dreadfully
pale
in
her
long
mourning
veil
are
you
sure
this
wo
tire
you
too
much
dear
shall
we
go
outside
for
a
little
while
oh
no
please
do
not
worry
about
me
thérèse
replied
indeed
i
shall
be
all
right
president
bonnet
sat
by
the
two
ladies
he
had
been
engaged
solemnly
exchanging
bows
with
everyone
in
the
court
room
whom
he
considered
it
flattering
to
himself
to
know
now
he
took
part
in
the
conversation
and
displayed
his
special
knowledge
by
explaining
the
constitution
of
the
court
and
pointing
out
where
the
clerk
sat
and
where
the
public
prosecutor
sat
and
where
the
jury
sat
all
at
great
length
and
much
to
the
interest
of
the
people
near
him
with
however
one
exception
a
man
dressed
entirely
in
black
with
his
head
half
buried
in
the
huge
collar
of
a
travelling
ulster
and
dark
glasses
over
his
eyes
appeared
to
be
vastly
bored
by
the
old
magistrate
disquisition
juve
for
it
was
he
knew
too
much
about
legal
procedure
to
require
explanations
from
president
bonnet
suddenly
a
thrill
ran
through
the
room
and
conversation
stopped
abruptly
etienne
rambert
had
just
walked
down
the
gangway
in
the
court
to
the
seat
reserved
for
him
just
in
front
of
the
witness
box
and
close
to
a
kind
of
rostrum
in
which
maître
dareuil
an
old
member
of
the
cahors
bar
immediately
took
his
place
etienne
rambert
was
very
pale
but
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
by
no
means
overwhelmed
by
the
fatality
overhanging
him
he
was
indeed
a
fine
figure
as
he
took
his
seat
and
mechanically
passed
his
hand
through
his
long
white
curls
flinging
them
back
and
raising
his
head
almost
as
if
in
defiance
of
the
inquisitive
crowd
that
was
gazing
at
him
almost
immediately
after
he
had
taken
his
seat
a
door
was
thrown
open
and
the
jury
filed
in
and
then
a
usher
came
forward
and
shrilly
called
for
silence
stand
up
gentlemen
hats
off
please
gentlemen
the
court
with
solemn
measured
steps
and
heads
bent
as
if
absorbed
in
profoundest
meditation
the
judges
slowly
proceeded
to
their
seats
the
president
formally
declared
the
court
open
whereupon
the
clerk
rose
immediately
to
read
the
indictment
the
clerk
of
the
court
at
cahors
was
a
most
excellent
man
but
modesty
was
his
distinguishing
characteristic
and
his
chief
desire
appeared
to
be
to
shun
responsibility
figure
as
little
prominently
as
possible
and
even
escape
observation
altogether
assizes
were
not
often
held
at
cahors
and
he
had
had
few
occasions
to
read
an
indictment
as
tragic
as
this
present
one
with
the
result
that
he
lacked
confidence
now
he
read
in
a
toneless
monotonous
voice
so
nervously
and
softly
that
nobody
in
the
body
of
the
court
could
hear
a
word
he
said
and
even
the
jury
were
obliged
to
lean
their
elbows
on
the
desk
before
them
and
make
an
ear
trumpet
of
their
hands
to
find
out
what
it
was
all
about
etienne
rambert
however
was
only
a
few
feet
from
the
clerk
he
did
not
miss
a
word
and
it
was
evident
from
his
nervous
movements
every
now
and
then
that
some
passages
in
the
indictment
hit
him
very
hard
indeed
and
even
lessened
his
general
confidence
when
the
clerk
had
finished
etienne
rambert
sat
still
with
his
forehead
resting
in
his
hands
as
if
crushed
by
the
weight
of
the
memories
the
indictment
had
evoked
then
the
sharp
thin
voice
of
the
president
of
the
court
snapped
the
chain
of
his
thoughts
stand
up
sir
and
pale
as
death
etienne
rambert
rose
and
folded
his
arms
across
his
breast
in
firm
yet
somehow
muffled
tones
he
answered
the
preliminary
formal
questions
his
name
was
hervé
paul
etienne
rambert
his
age
his
occupation
a
merchant
owning
and
working
rubber
plantations
in
south
america
then
followed
the
formal
enquiry
whether
he
had
heard
and
understood
the
indictment
which
had
just
been
read
i
followed
it
all
sir
he
replied
with
a
little
gesture
expressive
of
his
sense
of
the
gravity
of
the
facts
detailed
and
the
weight
of
the
evidence
adduced
which
won
general
sympathy
for
him
i
followed
it
all
but
i
protest
against
some
of
the
allegations
and
i
protest
with
my
whole
energy
against
the
suggestion
that
i
have
failed
in
my
duty
as
a
man
of
honour
and
as
a
father
the
president
of
the
court
checked
him
irritably
excuse
me
i
do
not
intend
to
permit
you
to
extend
the
pleadings
indefinitely
i
shall
examine
you
on
the
various
points
of
the
indictment
and
you
may
protest
as
much
as
you
please
the
unfeeling
rudeness
provoked
no
comment
from
the
defendant
and
the
president
proceeded
well
you
have
heard
the
indictment
it
charges
you
first
with
having
aided
and
abetted
the
escape
of
your
son
whom
an
enquiry
held
in
another
place
had
implicated
in
the
murder
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
and
it
charges
you
secondly
with
having
killed
your
son
whose
body
has
been
recovered
from
the
dordogne
in
order
that
you
might
escape
the
penalty
of
public
obloquy
at
this
brutal
statement
of
the
case
etienne
rambert
made
a
proud
gesture
of
indignation
sir
he
exclaimed
there
are
different
ways
of
putting
things
i
do
not
deny
the
purport
of
the
indictment
but
i
object
to
the
summary
of
it
that
you
present
no
one
has
ever
dared
to
contend
that
i
killed
my
son
in
order
to
escape
public
obloquy
as
you
have
just
insinuated
i
am
entirely
indifferent
to
the
worlds
opinion
what
the
indictment
is
intended
to
allege
the
only
thing
it
can
allege
is
that
i
wrought
justice
upon
a
criminal
who
ought
to
have
filled
me
with
horror
but
whom
nevertheless
i
ought
not
to
have
handed
over
to
the
public
executioner
this
time
it
was
the
judge
turn
to
be
astonished
he
was
so
accustomed
to
the
cheap
triumphs
that
judges
look
to
win
in
court
that
he
had
expected
to
make
mincemeat
of
this
poor
broken
old
man
whom
the
law
had
delivered
to
his
tender
mercy
but
he
discovered
that
the
old
man
had
fine
courage
and
replied
with
spirit
to
his
malevolent
remarks
we
will
discuss
your
right
to
take
the
law
into
your
own
hands
presently
he
said
but
that
is
not
the
question
now
there
are
other
points
which
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
explain
to
the
jury
why
in
the
first
place
did
you
obstinately
decline
to
speak
to
the
examining
magistrate
i
had
no
answer
to
make
to
the
examining
magistrate
etienne
rambert
answered
slowly
as
if
he
were
weighing
his
words
because
in
my
opinion
he
had
no
questions
to
put
to
me
i
do
not
admit
that
i
am
charged
with
anything
contrary
to
the
code
or
that
any
such
charge
can
be
formulated
against
me
the
indictment
charges
me
with
having
killed
my
son
because
i
believed
him
to
be
guilty
of
the
murder
of
mme
de
langrune
and
would
not
hand
him
over
to
the
gallows
i
have
never
confessed
to
that
murder
sir
and
nothing
will
ever
make
me
do
so
and
that
is
why
i
would
not
reply
to
the
examining
magistrate
because
i
would
not
admit
that
there
was
anything
before
the
court
concerning
myself
because
since
the
dreadful
tragedy
in
my
private
life
was
exposed
to
public
opinion
i
desired
that
i
should
be
judged
by
public
opinion
which
sir
is
not
represented
by
you
who
are
a
professional
judge
but
by
the
jury
here
who
will
shortly
say
whether
i
am
really
a
criminal
wretch
by
the
jury
many
of
whom
are
fathers
themselves
and
when
they
think
of
their
own
sons
will
wonder
what
appalling
visions
must
have
passed
through
my
mind
when
i
was
forced
to
believe
that
my
boy
my
own
son
had
committed
a
cowardly
murder
what
sort
of
tragedy
will
they
think
that
must
have
been
for
a
man
like
me
with
sixty
years
of
honour
and
of
honourable
life
behind
him
the
outburst
ended
on
a
sob
and
the
whole
court
was
moved
with
sympathy
women
wiping
their
eyes
men
coughing
and
even
the
jury
striving
hard
to
conceal
the
emotion
that
stirred
them
the
judge
glared
round
the
court
and
after
a
pause
addressed
the
defendant
again
with
sarcastic
phrases
so
that
is
why
you
stood
mute
during
the
enquiry
was
it
sir
odd
very
odd
i
admire
the
interpretation
you
place
upon
your
duty
as
an
honourable
man
it
is
quaint
etienne
rambert
interrupted
the
sneering
speech
i
am
quite
sure
sir
that
there
are
plenty
of
people
here
who
will
understand
and
endorse
what
i
did
the
declaration
was
so
pointedly
personal
that
the
judge
took
it
up
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
people
of
principle
will
understand
me
when
i
have
shown
them
your
conduct
as
it
really
was
you
have
a
predilection
for
heroics
it
will
not
be
without
interest
to
bring
things
to
the
point
your
attitude
throughout
this
affair
has
been
this
it
is
not
for
me
to
anticipate
the
issue
of
the
enquiry
which
will
be
held
some
day
into
the
murder
of
mme
de
langrune
but
i
must
recall
the
fact
that
the
moment
you
believed
your
son
was
the
murderer
the
moment
you
discovered
the
towel
which
furnished
the
circumstantial
evidence
of
his
guilt
you
the
man
of
honour
mind
you
never
thought
of
handing
over
the
culprit
to
the
police
who
were
actually
in
the
precincts
of
the
château
but
only
thought
of
securing
his
escape
and
helping
him
to
get
away
you
even
accompanied
him
in
his
flight
and
so
became
in
a
sense
his
accomplice
i
suppose
you
do
not
deny
that
etienne
rambert
shook
with
emotion
and
answered
in
ringing
tones
if
you
are
of
opinion
sir
that
that
was
an
act
of
complicity
on
my
part
i
will
not
only
not
deny
it
i
will
proclaim
it
from
the
housetops
i
became
the
accomplice
of
a
murderer
by
inducing
him
to
run
away
did
i
you
forget
sir
that
at
the
moment
when
i
first
believed
my
son
was
the
culprit
i
was
not
his
accomplice
then
i
suppose
there
was
a
bond
between
him
and
me
already
that
i
could
not
possibly
break
he
was
my
son
sir
the
duty
of
a
father
and
i
attach
the
very
loftiest
meaning
to
the
word
can
never
entail
his
giving
up
his
son
a
fresh
murmur
of
sympathy
through
the
court
annoyed
the
judge
who
shrugged
his
shoulders
let
us
leave
empty
rhetoric
alone
he
said
you
have
plenty
of
fine
phrases
with
which
to
defend
your
action
that
indeed
is
your
concern
as
the
jury
will
doubtless
appreciate
but
i
think
it
will
be
more
advantageous
to
clear
up
the
facts
a
little
not
more
advantageous
to
you
perhaps
but
that
is
what
i
am
here
to
do
so
will
you
please
tell
me
whether
your
son
confessed
to
having
murdered
mme
de
langrune
either
during
that
night
when
you
persuaded
him
to
run
away
or
afterwards
yes
or
no
please
i
ca
answer
sir
my
son
was
mad
i
will
not
believe
my
son
was
a
criminal
there
was
absolutely
no
motive
to
prompt
him
to
the
deed
and
his
mother
is
in
an
asylum
that
is
the
whole
explanation
of
the
crime
if
he
committed
murder
it
was
in
a
fit
of
temporary
insanity
he
is
dead
i
refuse
to
cover
his
memory
with
the
stain
of
infamy
in
other
words
according
to
you
charles
rambert
did
confess
but
you
do
want
to
say
so
i
do
not
say
he
did
confess
you
leave
it
to
be
inferred
etienne
rambert
made
no
reply
and
the
judge
passed
on
to
another
point
what
exactly
did
you
do
after
you
left
the
château
what
anyone
does
i
suppose
when
he
runs
away
we
wandered
miserably
about
going
through
fields
and
woods
i
accusing
him
and
he
defending
himself
we
avoided
the
villages
scarcely
venturing
even
in
the
early
morning
to
go
and
buy
food
and
walked
quickly
wishing
to
get
as
far
away
as
possible
we
spent
the
most
frightful
time
it
is
possible
to
conceive
how
long
was
all
this
i
was
with
my
son
for
four
days
sir
so
it
was
on
the
fourth
day
that
you
killed
him
have
pity
sir
i
did
not
kill
my
son
it
was
a
murderer
that
i
had
with
me
a
murderer
for
whom
the
police
were
hunting
and
for
whom
the
guillotine
was
waiting
a
murderer
if
you
prefer
it
so
said
the
judge
entirely
heedless
of
the
unhappy
man
protests
but
you
had
no
right
to
assume
the
functions
of
executioner
come
you
admit
you
did
kill
him
i
do
not
admit
it
do
you
deny
that
you
killed
him
i
did
what
my
duty
told
me
to
do
still
the
same
story
said
the
judge
angrily
drumming
his
fingers
on
the
desk
you
refuse
to
answer
but
even
in
your
own
interests
you
must
have
the
courage
to
adopt
some
definite
theory
well
would
you
have
been
glad
if
your
son
had
taken
his
own
life
may
i
entreat
you
to
remember
that
my
son
is
dead
etienne
rambert
said
once
more
i
can
only
remember
the
one
fact
that
he
was
my
son
i
ca
say
that
i
desired
his
death
i
do
even
know
now
if
he
was
guilty
whatever
horror
i
may
feel
for
a
crime
i
can
only
remember
now
that
charles
was
not
in
his
right
mind
and
that
he
was
the
son
of
my
loins
again
a
tremor
of
emotion
passed
through
the
court
and
again
the
judge
made
an
angry
gesture
ordering
silence
so
you
decline
to
answer
any
of
the
principal
points
of
the
indictment
the
jury
will
no
doubt
appreciate
the
reason
well
can
you
let
us
know
any
of
the
advice
you
gave
your
son
if
you
did
not
desire
him
to
take
his
own
life
and
if
you
had
no
intention
of
killing
him
what
did
you
want
oblivion
said
etienne
rambert
more
calmly
this
time
it
was
not
for
me
to
give
my
son
up
and
i
could
only
desire
for
him
oblivion
and
if
that
was
impossible
then
death
i
implored
him
to
think
of
the
life
that
was
before
him
and
the
future
of
shame
and
i
urged
him
to
disappear
for
ever
ah
you
admit
you
did
recommend
him
to
commit
suicide
i
mean
i
wanted
him
to
go
abroad
the
president
feigned
to
be
occupied
with
his
notes
purposely
giving
time
for
the
importance
of
the
last
admission
he
had
wrung
from
etienne
rambert
to
sink
into
the
minds
of
the
jury
then
without
raising
his
head
he
asked
abruptly
you
were
very
surprised
to
hear
of
his
death
no
said
rambert
dully
how
did
you
part
from
each
other
the
last
night
we
slept
out
of
doors
under
a
stack
we
were
both
worn
out
and
i
prayed
god
of
his
mercy
to
have
pity
on
us
it
was
by
the
bank
of
the
dordogne
next
morning
when
i
woke
up
i
was
alone
he
my
son
had
disappeared
i
know
no
more
the
judge
quelled
the
emotion
in
the
court
by
a
threatening
glance
and
sprang
a
question
on
the
defendant
which
was
like
a
trap
to
catch
him
lying
if
at
that
time
you
knew
no
more
how
was
it
that
a
few
days
later
you
called
on
inspector
juve
and
asked
him
at
once
what
was
known
about
the
dead
body
of
your
son
the
body
had
only
been
recovered
within
the
previous
hour
or
two
and
had
not
been
absolutely
identified
the
newspapers
at
any
rate
only
suggested
the
identity
with
the
utmost
reserve
but
you
sir
had
no
doubt
on
the
subject
you
knew
that
the
corpse
was
that
of
your
son
why
how
it
was
one
of
the
strongest
points
that
could
be
made
in
support
of
the
theory
that
etienne
rambert
had
murdered
his
son
and
the
defendant
immediately
saw
the
difficulty
he
would
have
in
giving
an
adequate
answer
without
compromising
himself
he
turned
to
the
jury
as
though
he
had
more
hope
in
them
than
in
the
court
gentlemen
he
cried
this
is
torture
i
can
bear
no
more
i
can
not
answer
any
more
you
know
quite
enough
to
form
your
judgment
of
me
form
it
now
say
if
i
failed
in
my
duty
as
a
man
of
honour
and
a
father
i
at
least
can
answer
no
more
questions
and
he
sank
back
in
his
place
like
a
beaten
man
crushed
by
the
distress
evoked
by
all
these
painful
memories
the
judge
nodded
to
the
jury
with
the
grim
complacency
of
a
man
who
has
run
down
his
game
this
refusal
to
answer
my
questions
is
in
itself
tantamount
to
a
confession
he
said
acidly
well
we
will
proceed
to
call
the
witnesses
i
should
like
to
say
that
the
most
interesting
witness
would
undoubtedly
be
bouzille
the
tramp
who
recovered
the
body
of
charles
rambert
but
unfortunately
that
individual
has
no
fixed
abode
and
it
has
not
been
possible
to
serve
him
with
a
subpoena
a
number
of
witnesses
succeeded
one
another
in
the
box
without
however
throwing
any
fresh
light
upon
the
matter
they
were
peasants
who
had
met
the
two
ramberts
when
they
were
flying
from
the
château
village
bakers
who
had
sold
them
bread
and
lockkeepers
who
had
seen
but
been
unable
to
recover
the
floating
corpse
the
people
in
the
court
began
to
weary
of
the
proceedings
the
more
so
as
it
was
confidently
rumoured
that
etienne
rambert
had
proudly
declined
to
call
any
witnesses
on
his
behalf
and
even
to
allow
his
counsel
to
make
any
rhetorical
appeal
to
the
jury
it
might
be
imprudent
but
there
was
something
fine
in
his
defiance
there
was
however
one
more
thrill
of
interest
for
the
public
the
judge
had
explained
that
he
deemed
it
unnecessary
to
call
the
detective
juve
inasmuch
as
all
the
information
he
had
to
give
was
already
detailed
in
the
long
indictment
but
as
mme
de
langrune
granddaughter
was
present
in
court
he
would
exercise
his
discretion
and
request
her
to
answer
one
or
two
questions
and
much
taken
aback
by
this
unexpected
publicity
thérèse
auvernois
followed
the
usher
to
the
mademoiselle
thérèse
auvernois
i
need
hardly
ask
if
you
recognise
rambert
but
do
you
identify
him
as
the
person
whose
conversation
with
young
charles
rambert
you
overheard
on
that
fatal
night
at
the
château
of
beaulieu
yes
sir
that
is
etienne
rambert
she
replied
in
low
tones
and
with
a
long
and
tender
look
of
pity
at
the
defendant
will
you
please
tell
us
anything
you
know
that
has
any
bearing
upon
the
charge
brought
against
the
defendant
the
charge
of
having
killed
his
son
thérèse
made
a
visible
effort
to
restrain
her
distress
i
can
only
say
one
thing
sir
that
rambert
was
talking
to
his
son
in
tones
of
such
terrible
distress
that
i
knew
his
heart
was
broken
by
the
tragedy
i
have
heard
so
much
from
my
dear
grandmother
about
etienne
rambert
that
i
can
only
remember
that
she
always
declared
him
to
be
a
man
of
the
very
highest
principle
and
i
can
only
tell
him
here
how
dreadfully
sorry
i
am
for
him
and
that
everybody
pities
him
as
much
as
i
do
the
judge
had
expected
that
thérèse
would
be
a
witness
hostile
to
the
defendant
whereas
anything
she
was
going
to
say
would
obviously
be
much
to
his
advantage
he
cut
her
short
that
is
enough
mademoiselle
thank
you
and
while
thérèse
was
going
back
to
her
seat
wiping
away
the
tears
that
would
come
to
her
eyes
despite
her
bravest
efforts
to
keep
her
in
the
presence
of
so
many
strangers
the
judge
announced
that
there
were
no
other
witnesses
to
be
heard
and
called
upon
the
public
prosecutor
to
address
the
court
that
personage
rose
at
once
and
made
a
harangue
that
was
eloquent
enough
no
doubt
but
introduced
no
new
features
into
the
case
he
relied
upon
his
law
rather
than
his
facts
rapidly
recapitulated
the
defendant
contradictions
and
pitifully
weak
arguments
if
arguments
they
could
be
called
claimed
that
the
facts
had
been
proved
despite
the
defendant
steady
refusal
to
answer
questions
and
insisted
on
the
point
that
the
defendant
had
no
right
whatever
to
take
the
law
into
his
own
hands
and
either
kill
his
son
or
aid
and
abet
in
his
flight
he
concluded
by
asking
for
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
a
sentence
of
penal
servitude
for
life
to
him
succeeded
counsel
for
the
defendant
whose
speech
was
brevity
itself
he
declined
to
make
any
appeal
but
simply
asked
the
jury
to
decide
whether
the
defendant
had
not
acted
as
any
father
would
act
when
he
discovered
that
his
son
had
committed
a
crime
during
a
fit
of
insanity
he
asked
only
for
an
impartial
decision
on
the
facts
from
men
of
high
principle
and
he
sat
down
conscious
of
having
focussed
the
issue
on
the
proper
point
and
secured
the
sympathy
of
the
public
the
judges
withdrew
to
their
room
the
jury
retired
to
consider
their
verdict
and
etienne
rambert
was
removed
between
two
warders
juve
had
not
stirred
during
the
whole
trial
or
displayed
the
least
sign
of
approval
or
disapproval
at
any
of
the
questions
and
answers
exchanged
he
sat
now
unobtrusively
listening
to
the
conversation
that
passed
near
him
relative
to
the
issue
of
the
case
president
bonnet
opined
that
etienne
rambert
had
blundered
in
refusing
to
put
up
any
defence
he
had
shown
contempt
of
court
which
was
always
unwise
and
the
court
would
show
him
no
mercy
dollon
was
of
another
opinion
according
to
him
etienne
rambert
was
a
sport
of
fate
deserving
pity
rather
than
severity
and
the
court
would
be
very
lenient
another
man
declared
that
etienne
rambert
had
been
in
an
impasse
however
fondly
he
loved
his
son
he
could
not
but
hope
that
he
might
commit
suicide
if
a
friend
committed
an
offence
against
the
laws
of
honour
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
put
a
pistol
into
his
hand
and
so
on
the
only
point
on
which
all
were
unanimous
was
their
sympathy
with
the
defendant
but
a
bell
rang
sharply
grave
and
impassive
the
jury
returned
the
judges
filed
once
more
into
their
seats
etienne
rambert
was
led
back
into
court
by
the
warders
in
tense
silence
the
foreman
of
the
jury
spoke
in
the
presence
of
god
and
of
man
and
upon
my
honour
and
my
conscience
i
declare
that
the
answer
of
the
jury
is
to
all
the
questions
put
and
that
is
the
answer
of
them
all
it
was
acquittal
there
was
no
applause
but
yet
it
seemed
as
if
the
words
that
set
the
defendant
free
had
relieved
every
bosom
of
an
overwhelming
dread
the
air
seemed
easier
to
breathe
and
there
was
no
one
there
but
seemed
physically
better
and
also
happier
for
hearing
a
verdict
which
gave
sanction
for
the
general
pity
they
had
felt
for
the
unhappy
defendant
a
man
of
honour
and
a
most
unhappy
father
by
their
verdict
the
jury
had
implicitly
applauded
and
commiserated
etienne
rambert
but
he
still
sat
in
the
dock
broken
and
prostrated
by
terrible
distress
sobbing
unreservedly
and
making
no
effort
to
restrain
his
immeasurable
grief
princess
sonia
bath
four
months
had
passed
since
etienne
rambert
had
been
acquitted
at
the
cahors
assizes
and
the
world
was
beginning
to
forget
the
beaulieu
tragedy
as
it
had
already
almost
forgotten
the
mysterious
murder
of
lord
beltham
juve
alone
did
not
allow
his
daily
occupation
to
put
the
two
cases
out
of
his
mind
true
he
had
ceased
to
make
any
direct
enquiries
and
gave
no
sign
that
he
still
had
any
interest
in
those
crimes
but
the
detective
knew
very
well
that
in
both
of
them
he
had
to
contend
with
no
ordinary
murderer
and
he
was
content
to
remain
in
the
shadow
waiting
and
watching
in
seeming
inactivity
for
some
slip
which
should
betray
the
person
or
persons
who
had
perpetrated
two
of
the
most
puzzling
murders
that
he
had
ever
had
to
deal
with
it
was
the
end
of
june
and
paris
was
beginning
to
empty
but
the
spring
had
been
late
and
cold
that
year
and
although
it
was
within
a
couple
of
days
of
july
society
had
lingered
on
in
the
capital
luxuriously
appointed
carriages
still
swept
along
the
champs
elysées
when
the
audiences
poured
out
of
theatres
and
concert
rooms
and
fashionably
attired
people
still
thronged
the
broad
pavements
and
gathered
before
the
brilliantly
lighted
cafés
on
the
even
at
that
late
hour
the
champs
elysées
were
as
animated
as
in
the
busiest
hours
of
the
day
at
the
royal
palace
hotel
the
greatest
animation
prevailed
the
entire
staff
was
hurrying
about
the
vast
entrance
halls
and
the
palatial
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
for
it
was
the
hour
when
the
guests
of
the
royal
palace
hotel
were
returning
from
their
evening
amusements
and
the
spacious
vestibules
of
the
immense
hotel
were
crowded
with
men
in
evening
dress
young
fellows
in
dinner
jackets
and
women
in
gowns
a
young
and
fashionable
woman
got
out
of
a
perfectly
appointed
victoria
and
louis
the
manager
of
the
staff
came
forward
and
bowed
low
as
he
only
did
to
clients
of
the
very
highest
distinction
the
lady
responded
with
a
gracious
smile
and
the
manager
called
a
servant
the
lift
for
mme
la
princesse
sonia
danidoff
and
the
next
moment
the
beautiful
vision
who
had
created
quite
a
sensation
merely
in
passing
through
the
hall
had
disappeared
within
the
lift
and
was
borne
up
to
her
apartments
princess
sonia
was
one
of
the
most
important
clients
that
the
royal
palace
hotel
possessed
she
belonged
to
one
of
the
greatest
families
in
the
world
being
by
her
marriage
with
prince
danidoff
cousin
to
the
emperor
of
russia
and
so
connected
with
many
royal
personages
still
barely
thirty
years
of
age
she
was
not
pretty
but
remarkably
lovely
with
wonderful
blue
eyes
which
formed
a
strange
and
most
bewitching
contrast
to
the
heavy
masses
of
black
hair
that
framed
her
face
a
woman
of
immense
wealth
and
typically
a
woman
of
the
world
the
princess
spent
six
months
of
the
year
in
paris
where
she
was
a
and
figure
in
the
most
exclusive
circles
she
was
clever
and
cultivated
a
musician
and
her
reputation
was
spotless
although
it
was
very
seldom
that
she
was
accompanied
by
her
husband
whose
duties
as
grand
chamberlain
to
the
tsar
kept
him
almost
continuously
in
russia
when
in
paris
she
occupied
a
suite
of
four
rooms
on
the
third
floor
of
the
royal
palace
hotel
a
suite
identical
in
plan
and
in
luxury
with
that
reserved
for
sovereigns
who
came
there
incognito
the
princess
passed
through
her
a
vast
round
room
with
a
superb
view
over
the
arc
de
triomphe
and
went
into
her
bedroom
where
she
switched
on
the
electric
light
nadine
she
called
in
her
grave
melodious
voice
and
a
young
girl
almost
a
child
sprang
from
a
low
divan
hidden
in
a
corner
nadine
take
off
my
cloak
and
unfasten
my
hair
then
you
can
leave
me
it
is
late
and
i
am
tired
the
little
maid
obeyed
helped
her
mistress
to
put
on
a
silken
dressing
gown
and
loosened
the
masses
of
her
hair
the
princess
passed
a
hand
across
her
brow
as
if
to
brush
away
a
headache
before
you
go
get
a
bath
ready
for
me
i
think
that
would
rest
me
ten
minutes
later
nadine
crept
back
like
a
shadow
and
found
the
princess
standing
dreamily
on
the
balcony
inhaling
deep
breaths
of
the
pure
night
air
the
child
kissed
the
tips
of
her
mistress
fingers
your
bath
is
quite
ready
she
said
and
then
withdrew
a
few
more
minutes
passed
and
princess
sonia
half
undressed
was
just
going
into
her
when
suddenly
she
turned
and
went
back
to
the
middle
of
the
bedroom
which
she
had
been
on
the
point
of
leaving
nadine
she
called
are
you
still
there
no
answer
came
i
must
have
been
dreaming
the
princess
murmured
but
i
thought
i
heard
someone
moving
about
sonia
danidoff
was
not
unduly
nervous
but
like
most
people
who
live
much
alone
and
in
large
hotels
she
was
wont
to
be
careful
and
wished
to
make
sure
that
no
suspicious
person
had
made
his
way
into
her
rooms
she
made
a
rapid
survey
of
her
bedroom
glanced
into
the
brilliantly
lighted
and
then
moved
to
her
bed
and
saw
that
the
electric
bell
board
which
enabled
her
to
summon
any
of
her
own
or
of
the
hotel
servants
was
in
perfect
order
then
satisfied
she
went
into
her
quickly
slipped
off
the
rest
of
her
clothes
and
plunged
into
the
perfumed
water
in
her
bath
she
thrilled
with
pleasure
as
her
limbs
so
tired
after
a
long
evening
relaxed
in
the
warm
water
on
a
table
close
to
the
bath
she
had
placed
a
volume
of
old
muscovite
folk
tales
and
she
was
glancing
through
these
by
the
shaded
light
from
a
lamp
above
her
when
a
fresh
sound
made
her
start
she
sat
up
quickly
in
the
water
and
looked
around
her
there
was
nothing
there
then
a
little
shiver
shook
her
and
she
sank
down
again
in
the
warm
bath
with
a
laugh
at
her
own
nervousness
and
she
was
just
beginning
to
read
once
more
when
suddenly
a
strange
voice
with
a
ring
of
malice
in
it
sounded
in
her
ear
someone
was
looking
over
her
shoulder
and
reading
aloud
the
words
she
had
just
begun
before
sonia
danidoff
had
time
to
utter
a
cry
or
make
a
movement
a
strong
hand
was
over
her
lips
and
another
gripped
her
wrist
preventing
her
from
reaching
the
button
of
the
electric
bell
that
was
fixed
among
the
taps
the
princess
was
almost
fainting
she
was
expecting
some
horrible
shock
expecting
to
feel
some
horrible
weapon
that
would
take
her
life
when
the
pressure
on
her
lips
and
the
grip
upon
her
wrist
gradually
relaxed
and
at
the
same
moment
the
mysterious
individual
who
had
thus
taken
her
by
surprise
moved
round
the
bath
and
stood
in
front
of
her
he
was
a
man
of
about
forty
years
of
age
and
extremely
well
dressed
a
perfectly
cut
dinner
jacket
proved
that
the
strange
visitor
was
no
unclean
dweller
in
the
paris
slums
no
apache
such
as
the
princess
had
read
terrifying
descriptions
of
in
luridly
illustrated
newspapers
the
hands
which
had
held
her
motionless
and
which
now
restored
her
liberty
of
movement
to
her
were
white
and
well
manicured
and
adorned
with
a
few
plain
rings
the
man
face
was
a
distinguished
one
and
he
wore
a
very
fine
black
beard
slight
baldness
added
to
the
height
of
a
forehead
naturally
large
but
what
struck
the
princess
most
although
she
had
little
heart
to
observe
the
man
very
closely
was
the
abnormal
size
of
his
head
and
the
number
of
wrinkles
that
ran
right
across
his
temples
following
the
line
of
the
eyebrows
in
silence
and
with
trembling
lips
sonia
danidoff
made
an
instinctive
effort
again
to
reach
the
electric
bell
but
with
a
quick
movement
the
man
caught
her
shoulder
and
prevented
her
from
doing
so
there
was
a
cryptic
smile
upon
the
stranger
lips
and
with
a
furious
blush
sonia
danidoff
dived
back
again
into
the
milky
water
in
the
bath
the
man
still
stood
in
perfect
silence
and
at
length
the
princess
mastered
her
emotion
and
spoke
to
him
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
go
at
once
or
i
will
call
for
help
above
all
things
do
not
call
out
or
you
are
a
dead
woman
said
the
stranger
harshly
then
he
gave
a
little
ironical
shrug
of
his
shoulders
as
for
ringing
that
would
not
be
easy
you
would
have
to
leave
the
water
to
do
so
and
besides
i
object
if
it
is
money
or
rings
you
want
said
the
princess
between
clenched
teeth
take
them
but
go
the
princess
had
laid
several
rings
and
bracelets
on
the
table
by
her
side
and
the
man
glanced
at
them
now
but
without
paying
much
attention
to
what
the
princess
said
those
trinkets
are
not
bad
he
said
but
your
signet
ring
is
much
finer
and
he
calmly
took
the
princess
hand
in
his
and
examined
the
ring
that
she
had
kept
on
her
third
finger
do
be
frightened
he
added
as
he
felt
her
hand
trembling
let
us
have
a
chat
if
you
mind
there
is
nothing
especially
tempting
about
jewels
apart
from
their
personality
he
said
after
a
little
pause
apart
i
mean
from
the
person
who
habitually
wears
them
but
the
bracelet
on
a
wrist
or
the
necklace
round
a
neck
or
the
ring
upon
a
finger
is
another
matter
princess
sonia
was
as
pale
as
death
and
utterly
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
this
extraordinary
visitor
was
driving
at
she
held
up
her
ring
finger
and
made
a
frightened
little
apology
i
can
not
take
this
ring
off
it
fits
too
tight
the
man
laughed
grimly
that
does
not
matter
in
the
least
princess
anyone
who
wanted
to
get
a
ring
like
that
could
do
it
quite
simply
he
felt
negligently
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
produced
a
miniature
razor
which
he
opened
he
flashed
the
blade
before
the
terrified
eyes
of
the
princess
with
a
sharp
blade
like
this
a
skilful
man
could
cut
off
the
finger
that
had
such
a
splendid
jewel
on
it
in
a
couple
of
seconds
and
then
seeing
that
the
princess
in
fresh
panic
was
on
the
very
point
of
screaming
quick
as
a
flash
he
laid
the
palm
of
his
hand
over
her
lips
while
still
speaking
in
gentle
tones
to
her
please
do
not
be
so
terrified
i
suppose
you
take
me
for
some
common
hotel
thief
or
highway
robber
but
princess
can
you
really
believe
that
i
am
anything
of
the
kind
the
man
tone
was
so
earnest
and
there
was
so
deferent
a
look
in
his
eyes
that
the
princess
recovered
some
of
her
courage
but
i
do
not
know
who
you
are
she
said
half
questioningly
so
much
the
better
the
man
replied
there
is
still
time
to
make
one
another
acquaintance
i
know
who
you
are
and
that
is
the
main
thing
you
do
not
know
me
princess
well
i
assure
you
that
on
very
many
an
occasion
i
have
mingled
with
the
blessed
company
of
your
adorers
the
princess
anger
rose
steadily
with
her
courage
sir
she
said
i
do
not
know
if
you
are
joking
or
if
you
are
talking
seriously
but
your
behaviour
is
extraordinary
hateful
abominable
it
is
merely
original
princess
and
it
pleases
me
to
reflect
that
if
i
had
been
content
to
be
presented
to
you
in
the
ordinary
way
in
one
or
other
of
the
many
we
both
frequent
you
would
certainly
have
taken
much
less
notice
of
me
than
you
have
taken
from
the
persistence
of
your
gaze
i
can
see
that
from
this
day
onwards
not
a
single
feature
of
my
face
will
be
unfamiliar
to
you
and
i
am
convinced
that
whatever
happens
you
will
remember
it
for
a
very
long
time
princess
sonia
tried
to
force
a
smile
she
had
recovered
her
and
was
wondering
what
kind
of
man
she
had
to
deal
with
if
she
was
still
not
quite
persuaded
that
this
was
not
a
vulgar
thief
and
if
she
had
but
little
faith
in
his
professions
of
admiration
of
herself
she
was
considerably
exercised
by
the
idea
that
she
was
alone
with
a
lunatic
the
man
seemed
to
read
her
thoughts
for
he
too
smiled
a
little
i
am
glad
to
see
princess
that
you
have
a
little
more
confidence
now
we
shall
be
able
to
arrange
things
ever
so
much
better
you
are
certainly
much
more
calm
much
less
uneasy
now
oh
yes
you
are
he
added
checking
her
protest
why
it
is
quite
five
minutes
since
you
last
tried
to
ring
for
help
we
are
getting
on
besides
i
somehow
picture
the
princess
sonia
danidoff
wife
of
the
grand
chamberlain
and
cousin
of
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
all
the
russias
allowing
herself
to
be
surprised
alone
with
a
man
whom
she
did
not
know
if
she
were
to
ring
and
someone
came
how
would
the
princess
account
for
the
gentleman
to
whom
she
had
accorded
an
audience
in
the
most
delightful
but
certainly
the
most
private
of
all
her
apartments
but
tell
me
pleaded
the
unhappy
woman
how
did
you
get
in
here
that
is
not
the
question
the
stranger
replied
the
problem
actually
before
us
is
how
am
i
to
get
out
for
of
course
princess
i
shall
not
be
so
indelicate
as
to
prolong
my
visit
unduly
too
happy
only
if
you
will
permit
me
to
repeat
it
on
some
other
evening
soon
he
turned
his
head
and
plunging
his
hand
into
the
bath
in
the
most
natural
manner
possible
took
out
the
thermometer
which
was
floating
on
the
perfumed
water
thirty
degrees
centigrade
princess
your
bath
is
getting
cold
you
must
get
out
in
her
blank
astonishment
princess
sonia
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
was
she
alone
with
a
monster
who
after
having
played
with
her
as
a
cat
plays
with
a
mouse
would
suddenly
turn
and
kill
her
or
was
this
merely
some
irresponsible
lunatic
whom
chance
alone
had
enabled
to
get
into
her
rooms
whatever
the
fact
might
be
the
man
last
words
had
made
her
aware
that
her
bath
really
was
getting
cold
a
shiver
shook
her
whole
frame
and
yet
oh
go
please
go
she
implored
him
he
shook
his
head
an
ironical
smile
in
his
eyes
for
pity
sake
she
entreated
him
again
have
mercy
on
a
woman
a
good
woman
the
man
appeared
to
be
considering
it
is
very
embarrassing
he
murmured
and
yet
we
must
decide
upon
something
soon
for
i
am
most
anxious
you
should
not
take
a
chill
oh
it
is
very
simple
princess
of
course
you
know
the
arrangement
of
everything
here
so
well
that
you
could
find
your
at
once
by
merely
feeling
your
way
we
will
put
out
the
light
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
get
out
of
the
bath
in
the
dark
without
the
least
fear
he
was
on
the
very
point
of
turning
off
the
switch
of
the
lamp
when
he
stopped
abruptly
and
came
back
to
the
bath
i
was
forgetting
that
exasperating
bell
he
said
a
movement
is
so
very
easily
made
suppose
you
were
to
ring
by
mere
inadvertence
and
regret
it
afterwards
putting
his
idea
into
action
the
man
made
a
quick
cut
with
his
razor
and
severed
the
two
electric
wires
several
feet
above
the
ground
that
is
excellent
he
said
by
the
way
i
do
know
where
these
other
two
wires
go
that
run
along
the
wall
but
it
is
best
to
be
on
the
safe
side
suppose
there
were
another
bell
he
lifted
his
razor
once
more
and
was
trying
to
sever
the
electric
wires
when
the
steel
blade
cut
the
insulator
and
an
alarming
flash
of
light
resulted
the
man
leaped
into
the
air
and
dropped
his
razor
good
lord
he
growled
i
suppose
that
will
make
you
happy
madame
i
have
burnt
my
hand
most
horribly
these
must
be
wires
for
the
light
but
no
matter
i
have
still
got
one
sound
hand
and
that
will
be
enough
for
me
to
secure
the
darkness
that
you
want
and
anyhow
you
can
press
the
button
of
your
bell
as
much
as
you
like
it
wo
ring
so
i
am
sure
of
a
few
more
minutes
in
your
company
sudden
darkness
fell
upon
the
room
sonia
danidoff
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
half
rose
in
the
bath
all
her
pride
as
a
great
lady
was
in
revolt
if
she
must
defend
her
honour
and
her
life
she
was
ready
to
do
so
and
despair
would
give
her
strength
but
in
any
event
she
would
be
better
out
of
the
water
and
on
her
feet
prepared
the
darkness
was
complete
both
in
the
bathroom
and
in
the
adjacent
bedroom
and
the
silence
was
absolute
standing
up
in
the
bath
sonia
danidoff
swept
her
arms
round
in
a
circle
to
feel
for
any
obstacle
her
touch
met
nothing
she
drew
out
one
foot
and
then
the
other
sprang
towards
the
chair
on
which
she
had
left
her
slipped
into
it
with
feverish
haste
slid
her
feet
into
her
slippers
stood
motionless
for
just
a
second
and
then
with
sudden
decision
moved
to
the
switch
by
the
door
and
turned
on
the
light
the
man
had
gone
from
the
bathroom
but
taking
two
steps
towards
her
bedroom
sonia
danidoff
saw
him
smiling
at
her
from
the
far
end
of
that
room
sir
she
said
this
pleasantry
has
lasted
long
enough
you
must
go
you
shall
you
shall
shall
the
stranger
echoed
that
is
a
word
that
is
not
often
used
to
me
but
you
are
forgiven
for
not
knowing
that
princess
i
forgot
for
the
moment
that
i
have
not
been
presented
to
you
but
what
is
in
your
mind
now
between
them
was
a
little
escritoire
on
the
top
of
which
was
lying
the
tiny
inlaid
revolver
that
sonia
danidoff
always
carried
when
she
went
out
at
night
could
she
but
get
that
into
her
hands
it
would
be
a
potent
argument
to
induce
this
stranger
to
obey
her
the
princess
also
knew
that
in
the
drawer
of
that
escritoire
which
she
could
actually
see
half
open
she
had
placed
only
a
few
minutes
before
going
in
to
her
bath
a
filled
with
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
francs
money
she
had
withdrawn
from
the
of
the
hotel
that
very
morning
in
order
to
meet
some
bills
next
day
she
looked
at
the
drawer
and
wondered
if
the
was
still
there
or
if
this
mysterious
admirer
of
hers
was
only
a
vulgar
hotel
thief
after
all
the
man
had
followed
her
eyes
to
the
revolver
that
is
an
unusual
to
find
in
a
lady
room
princess
and
he
sprang
in
front
of
her
as
she
was
taking
a
step
towards
the
escritoire
and
took
possession
of
the
revolver
do
not
be
alarmed
he
added
noticing
her
little
gesture
of
terror
i
would
not
do
you
an
injury
for
anything
in
the
world
i
shall
be
delighted
to
give
this
back
to
you
in
a
minute
but
first
let
me
render
it
harmless
he
deftly
slipped
the
six
cartridges
out
of
the
barrel
and
then
handed
the
now
useless
weapon
to
the
princess
with
a
gallant
little
bow
do
not
laugh
at
my
excess
of
caution
but
accidents
happen
so
easily
it
was
in
vain
that
the
princess
tried
to
get
near
her
escritoire
to
ascertain
if
the
drawer
had
been
tampered
with
the
man
kept
between
her
and
it
all
the
time
still
smiling
still
polite
but
watching
every
movement
that
she
made
suddenly
he
took
his
watch
from
his
pocket
two
already
princess
you
will
be
vexed
with
me
for
having
abused
your
hospitality
to
such
an
extent
i
must
go
he
appeared
not
to
notice
the
sigh
of
relief
that
broke
from
her
but
went
on
in
a
melodramatic
tone
i
shall
take
my
departure
not
through
the
window
like
a
lover
nor
up
the
chimney
like
a
thief
nor
yet
through
a
secret
door
behind
the
arras
like
a
brigand
of
romance
but
like
a
gentleman
who
has
come
to
pay
his
tribute
of
homage
and
respect
to
the
most
enchanting
woman
in
the
world
through
the
door
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
go
and
came
back
and
what
do
you
think
of
doing
now
princess
perhaps
you
will
be
angry
with
me
possibly
some
unpleasant
discovery
made
after
my
departure
will
raise
some
animosity
in
your
breast
against
me
you
might
even
ring
directly
my
back
is
turned
and
alarm
the
staff
merely
to
embarrass
me
in
my
exit
and
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
subsequent
possible
scandal
that
is
a
complicated
arrangement
of
bells
and
telephones
beside
your
bed
it
would
be
a
pity
to
spoil
such
a
pretty
thing
and
besides
i
hate
doing
unnecessary
damage
the
princess
eyes
turned
once
more
to
the
drawer
it
was
practically
certain
that
her
money
was
not
there
now
but
the
man
broke
in
again
upon
her
thoughts
what
can
i
be
thinking
of
just
fancy
my
not
having
presented
myself
to
you
even
yet
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
not
want
to
tell
you
my
name
out
loud
it
is
a
romantic
one
utterly
out
of
keeping
with
the
typically
modern
environment
in
which
we
are
now
ah
if
we
were
only
on
the
steep
side
of
some
mountain
with
the
moon
like
a
great
lamp
above
us
or
by
the
shore
of
some
wild
ocean
there
would
be
some
fascination
in
the
proclamation
of
my
identity
in
the
silence
of
the
night
or
in
the
midst
of
lightning
and
thunder
as
the
hurricane
swept
the
seas
but
here
in
a
suite
of
the
royal
palace
hotel
surrounded
by
telephones
and
electric
light
and
standing
by
a
window
overlooking
the
champs
elysées
it
would
be
a
positive
anachronism
he
took
a
card
out
of
his
pocket
and
drew
near
the
little
escritoire
allow
me
princess
to
slip
my
card
into
this
drawer
left
open
on
purpose
it
would
seem
and
while
the
princess
uttered
an
exclamation
she
could
not
repress
he
suited
the
action
to
the
word
and
now
princess
he
went
on
compelling
her
to
retreat
before
him
right
to
the
door
of
the
anteroom
opening
on
to
the
corridor
you
are
too
well
bred
i
am
sure
not
to
wish
to
conduct
your
visitor
to
the
door
of
your
suite
his
tone
altered
abruptly
and
in
a
deep
imperious
voice
that
made
the
princess
quake
he
ordered
her
and
now
not
a
word
not
a
cry
not
a
movement
until
i
am
outside
or
i
will
kill
you
clenching
her
fists
and
summoning
all
her
strength
to
prevent
herself
from
swooning
sonia
danidoff
led
the
man
to
the
anteroom
door
slowly
she
unlocked
the
door
and
held
it
open
and
the
man
stepped
quietly
through
the
next
second
he
was
gone
leaping
back
into
her
bedroom
sonia
danidoff
set
every
bell
with
great
presence
of
mind
she
telephoned
down
to
the
hall
porter
do
let
anybody
go
out
i
have
been
robbed
and
she
pressed
hard
upon
the
special
button
that
set
the
great
alarm
bell
clanging
footsteps
and
voices
resounded
in
the
corridor
the
princess
knew
that
help
was
coming
and
ran
to
open
her
door
the
night
watchman
and
the
manager
of
the
third
floor
came
running
up
and
waiters
appeared
in
numbers
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
stop
him
stop
him
the
princess
shouted
he
has
only
just
gone
out
a
man
in
a
dinner
jacket
with
a
great
black
beard
a
lad
came
hurrying
out
of
the
lift
where
are
you
going
what
is
the
matter
enquired
the
hall
porter
whose
lodge
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
next
to
the
courtyard
of
the
hotel
the
door
into
which
he
had
just
closed
i
do
know
he
answered
there
is
a
thief
in
the
hotel
they
are
calling
from
the
other
side
it
not
in
your
set
then
by
the
way
what
floor
are

on
the
second
all
right
said
the
hall
porter
it
the
third
floor
that
they
are
calling
from
go
up
and
see
what
is
wrong
the
lad
turned
on
his
heel
and
disregarding
the
notice
forbidding
servants
to
use
the
passenger
lift
hurried
back
into
it
and
upstairs
again
he
was
a
stoutly
built
fellow
with
a
smooth
face
and
red
hair
on
the
third
floor
he
stopped
immediately
opposite
sonia
suite
the
princess
was
standing
at
her
door
taking
no
notice
of
the
watchman
muller
efforts
to
soothe
her
excitement
and
mechanically
twisting
between
her
fingers
the
blank
visiting
card
which
her
strange
visitor
had
left
in
place
of
her
and
the
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
francs
there
was
no
name
whatever
on
the
card
well
said
muller
to
the
lad
where
do
you
come
from
i
the
new
man
on
the
second
floor
the
fellow
answered
the
hall
porter
sent
me
up
to
find
out
what
was
the
matter
matter
said
muller
somebody
has
robbed
the
princess
here
send
someone
for
the
police
at
once
i
run
sir
and
as
the
lift
instead
of
being
sent
down
had
carelessly
been
sent
up
to
the
top
floor
the
young
fellow
ran
down
the
staircase
at
full
speed
through
the
telephone
muller
was
just
ordering
the
hall
porter
to
send
for
the
police
when
the
servant
rushed
up
and
caught
him
by
the
arm
dragging
him
away
from
the
instrument
open
the
door
for
the
lord
sake
i
off
to
the
police
station
and
the
hall
porter
made
haste
to
facilitate
his
departure
on
the
top
floor
cries
of
astonishment
the
servants
had
been
alarmed
by
the
uproar
and
surprised
to
see
the
lift
stop
and
nobody
get
out
of
it
they
opened
the
door
and
found
a
heap
of
clothing
a
false
beard
and
a
wig
two
housemaids
and
a
valet
gazed
in
amazement
at
these
extraordinary
properties
and
never
thought
of
informing
the
manager
louis
meantime
however
that
gentleman
had
hurried
through
the
mazes
of
the
hotel
and
had
just
reached
the
third
floor
when
he
was
stopped
by
the
baronne
van
den
rosen
one
of
the
hotel
oldest
patronesses
m
louis
she
exclaimed
bursting
into
sobs
i
have
just
been
robbed
of
my
diamond
necklace
i
left
it
in
a
on
my
table
before
going
down
to
dinner
when
i
heard
the
noise
just
now
i
got
up
and
looked
through
my
and
the
necklace
is
not
there
louis
was
too
dazed
to
reply
muller
ran
up
to
him
princess
sonia
danidoff
has
been
stolen
he
announced
but
i
have
had
the
hotel
doors
shut
and
we
shall
be
sure
to
catch
the
thief
the
princess
came
near
to
explain
matters
but
at
that
moment
the
servants
came
down
from
upstairs
bringing
with
them
the
articles
which
they
had
found
in
the
lift
they
laid
these
on
the
ground
without
a
word
and
louis
was
staring
at
them
when
muller
had
a
sudden
inspiration
louis
what
is
the
new
man
on
the
second
floor
like
just
at
that
instant
a
servant
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
a
man
with
white
whiskers
and
a
bald
head
there
he
is
coming
towards
us
louis
replied
his
name
is
arnold
good
god
cried
muller
and
the
fellow
the
carroty
chap
louis
shook
his
head
not
understanding
and
muller
tore
himself
away
and
rushed
down
to
the
hall
porter
has
he
gone
out
has
anyone
gone
out
no
one
said
the
porter
except
of
course
the
servant
from
the
second
floor
whom
you
sent
for
the
police
the
carroty
chap
muller
enquired
yes
the
carroty
chap
princess
sonia
danidoff
lay
back
in
an
easy
chair
receiving
the
anxious
attentions
of
nadine
her
circassian
maid
louis
was
holding
salts
to
her
nostrils
the
princess
still
held
in
her
hands
the
card
left
by
the
mysterious
stranger
who
had
just
robbed
her
so
cleverly
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
francs
as
she
slowly
came
to
herself
the
princess
gazed
at
the
card
as
if
fascinated
and
this
time
her
haggard
eyes
grew
wide
with
astonishment
for
upon
the
card
which
hitherto
had
appeared
immaculately
white
marks
and
letters
were
gradually
becoming
visible
and
the
princess
read
fan
tô
mas
xi
magistrate
and
detective
fuselier
was
standing
in
his
office
in
the
law
courts
at
paris
meditatively
smoothing
the
nap
of
his
silk
hat
his
mind
was
busy
with
the
enquiries
he
had
been
prosecuting
during
the
day
and
although
he
had
no
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
with
his
day
work
he
had
no
clear
idea
as
to
what
his
next
steps
ought
to
be
three
discreet
taps
on
the
door
broke
in
upon
his
thoughts
come
in
he
said
and
then
stepped
forward
with
a
hearty
welcome
as
he
recognised
his
visitor
juve
by
all
that
is
wonderful
what
good
wind
has
blown
you
here
i
have
seen
you
for
ages
busy
frightfully
well
it
a
fact
that
there
no
dearth
of
sensational
crime
just
now
the
calendar
is
terribly
heavy
juve
had
ensconced
himself
in
a
huge
easy
chair
in
a
corner
of
the
room
yes
he
said
you
are
quite
right
but
unfortunately
the
calendar
wo
be
a
brilliant
one
for
the
police
there
may
be
lots
of
cases
but
there
are
not
lots
that
they
have
worked
out
to
a
finish
you
got
nothing
to
grumble
at
fuselier
smiled
you
have
been
in
enough
cases
lately
that
were
worked
out
to
a
finish
your
reputation
is
in
any
danger
of
diminishing
i
do
know
what
you
mean
juve
said
deprecatingly
if
you
refer
to
the
beltham
and
langrune
cases
you
must
admit
that
your
congratulations
are
not
deserved
i
have
achieved
no
definite
result
in
either
of
those
affairs
fuselier
also
dropped
into
a
comfortable
chair
he
lighted
a
cigarette
you
have
found
out
nothing
fresh
about
that
mysterious
murder
of
lord
beltham
nothing
i
done
it
is
an
insoluble
mystery
to
me
you
seem
to
be
very
sorry
for
yourself
but
really
you
need
be
juve
you
cleared
up
the
beltham
case
and
you
solved
the
langrune
case
although
you
try
to
make
out
you
did
and
allow
me
to
inform
you
those
two
successes
count
my
friend
you
are
very
kind
but
you
are
rather
misinformed
unfortunately
i
have
not
cleared
up
the
beltham
case
at
all
you
found
the
missing
peer
well
yes
but
that
was
an
amazing
achievement
by
the
way
juve
what
led
you
to
go
to
the
rue
lévert
to
search
gurn
trunks
that
was
very
simple
you
remember
what
an
excitement
there
was
when
lord
beltham
disappeared
well
when
i
was
called
in
i
saw
at
once
that
all
ideas
of
accident
or
suicide
might
be
dismissed
and
that
consequently
the
disappearance
was
due
to
crime
once
convinced
of
that
i
very
naturally
suspected
every
single
person
who
had
ever
had
relations
with
lord
beltham
for
there
was
no
single
individual
for
me
to
suspect
then
i
found
out
that
the
had
been
in
continuous
association
with
an
englishman
named
gurn
whom
he
had
known
in
the
south
african
war
and
who
led
a
very
queer
sort
of
life
that
of
course
took
me
to
gurn
place
if
for
nothing
else
than
to
pick
up
information
and
well
that
all
about
it
it
was
just
by
going
to
gurn
place
to
pump
him
rather
than
anything
else
that
i
found
the
noble
lord
remains
locked
away
in
the
trunk
your
modesty
is
delightful
juve
said
fuselier
with
an
approving
nod
you
present
things
as
if
they
were
all
matters
of
course
whereas
really
you
are
proving
your
extraordinary
instinct
if
you
had
arrived
only
hours
later
the
corpse
would
have
been
packed
off
to
the
transvaal
and
only
the
lord
knows
if
after
that
the
extraordinary
mystery
ever
would
have
been
cleared
up
luck
juve
protested
pure
luck
and
were
your
other
remarkable
discoveries
luck
too
enquired
fuselier
with
a
smile
there
was
your
discovery
that
sulphate
of
zinc
had
been
injected
into
the
body
to
prevent
it
from
smelling
offensively
that
was
only
a
matter
of
using
my
eyes
juve
protested
all
right
said
the
magistrate
we
will
admit
that
you
did
not
display
any
remarkable
acumen
in
the
beltham
case
if
you
would
rather
have
it
so
that
does
not
alter
the
fact
that
you
have
solved
the
langrune
case
solved
it
fuselier
flicked
the
ash
off
his
cigarette
and
leant
forward
towards
the
detective
of
course
you
know
that
i
know
you
were
at
the
cahors
assizes
juve
what
was
your
impression
of
the
whole
affair
of
the
verdict
and
of
etienne
rambert
guilt
or
innocence
juve
got
up
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
followed
by
the
magistrate
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
hesitating
as
to
whether
he
would
answer
at
all
but
finally
he
stopped
abruptly
and
faced
his
friend
if
i
were
talking
to
anybody
but
you
fuselier
i
would
either
not
answer
at
all
or
i
would
give
an
answer
that
was
no
answer
but
as
it
is
well
in
my
opinion
the
langrune
case
is
only
just
beginning
and
nothing
certain
is
known
at
all
according
to
that
charles
rambert
is
innocent
i
do
say
that
what
then
i
suppose
you
do
think
the
father
was
the
murderer
the
hypothesis
is
not
absurd
but
there
what
is
the
real
truth
of
the
whole
affair
that
is
what
i
am
wondering
all
the
time
that
murder
is
never
out
of
my
head
it
interests
me
more
and
more
every
day
oh
yes
i
got
lots
of
ideas
but
they
are
all
utterly
vague
and
improbable
sometimes
my
imagination
seems
to
be
running
away
with
me
he
stopped
and
fuselier
wagged
a
mocking
finger
at
him
juve
he
said
i
charge
you
formally
with
attempting
to
implicate
fantômas
in
the
murder
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
the
detective
replied
in
the
same
tone
of
raillery
guilty
my
lord
good
lord
man
the
magistrate
exclaimed
fantômas
is
a
perfect
obsession
with
you
and
as
juve
acquiesced
with
a
laugh
the
magistrate
dropped
his
bantering
tone
shall
i
tell
you
something
juve
i
too
am
beginning
to
have
an
obsession
for
that
fantastic
miscreant
and
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
you
have
not
come
to
me
before
to
ask
me
about
that
sensational
robbery
at
the
royal
palace
hotel
the
robbery
from
princess
sonia
danidoff
yes
the
fantômas
robbery
fantômas
eh
juve
protested
that
remains
to
be
seen
why
man
fuselier
retorted
you
have
heard
that
detail
about
the
card
the
man
left
have
you
the
visiting
card
that
was
blank
when
the
princess
found
it
and
on
which
the
name
of
fantômas
afterwards
became
visible
there
no
fantômas
about
that
in
my
opinion
why
not
well
it
is
one
of
fantômas
little
ways
to
leave
clear
traces
behind
him
one
might
as
well
picture
him
committing
robbery
or
murder
in
a
cap
with
a
neat
little
band
round
it
and
he
might
even
add
and
dispatch
no
it
most
unlikely
you
do
think
fantômas
capable
of
throwing
down
his
glove
to
the
police
in
the
shape
of
some
such
material
proof
of
his
identity
i
always
base
my
arguments
on
the
balance
of
probabilities
juve
replied
what
emerges
from
this
royal
palace
story
is
that
some
common
hotel
thief
conceived
the
ingenious
idea
of
casting
suspicion
on
fantômas
it
was
just
a
trick
to
mislead
the
police
at
least
that
is
my
opinion
but
fuselier
declined
to
be
convinced
no
you
are
wrong
juve
it
was
no
common
hotel
thief
who
stole
mme
van
den
rosen
necklace
and
princess
sonia
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
francs
the
prize
was
big
enough
to
appeal
to
fantômas
and
the
amazing
audacity
of
the
crime
is
suggestive
too
just
think
what
coolness
the
man
must
have
had
to
be
able
to
paralyse
the
power
of
resistance
when
she
tried
to
call
for
help
and
also
to
get
clear
away
in
spite
of
the
hosts
of
servants
in
the
hotel
and
all
the
precautions
taken
tell
me
all
about
the
robbery
fuselier
said
juve
the
magistrate
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
took
up
the
notes
he
had
made
in
the
course
of
his
official
enquiry
that
day
he
told
juve
everything
he
had
been
able
to
elicit
the
most
amazing
thing
to
me
he
said
in
conclusion
is
the
way
the
fellow
when
he
had
once
got
out
of
princess
sonia
room
contrived
to
get
into
the
lift
shed
his
evening
dress
get
into
livery
and
make
his
first
attempt
to
escape
when
the
hall
porter
stopped
him
he
did
not
lose
his
head
but
got
into
the
lift
again
sent
that
flying
up
to
the
top
of
the
hotel
with
the
clothes
that
would
have
betrayed
him
calmly
presented
himself
before
muller
the
night
watchman
and
contrived
to
be
told
to
go
for
the
police
ran
down
the
stairs
again
and
took
advantage
of
the
night
watchman
telephoning
to
the
hall
porter
to
get
the
latter
to
open
the
door
for
him
and
so
marched
off
as
easily
as
you
please
a
man
who
kept
his
nerve
like
that
and
could
make
such
amazing
use
of
every
circumstance
who
was
so
quick
and
daring
and
who
was
capable
of
carrying
through
such
a
difficult
comedy
in
the
middle
of
the
general
uproar
richly
deserves
to
be
taken
for
fantômas
juve
sat
in
deep
consideration
of
the
whole
story
that
is
what
interests
me
most
he
said
at
last
his
escape
from
the
hotel
might
have
been
effected
by
any
clever
thief
what
i
think
more
remarkable
is
the
means
he
took
to
prevent
the
princess
from
screaming
when
he
was
just
leaving
her
rooms
that
really
was
masterly
instead
of
trying
to
get
her
as
far
away
as
possible
and
shut
her
up
in
her
bedroom
to
take
her
with
him
to
the
very
door
opening
on
to
the
corridor
where
the
faintest
cry
might
have
involved
the
worst
possible
consequences
and
to
be
sure
that
the
terror
he
had
inspired
would
prevent
her
from
uttering
that
cry
to
be
able
to
assume
that
the
victim
was
so
overwrought
that
she
would
make
no
effort
at
all
and
could
do
nothing
that
is
really
very
good
indeed
quite
admirable
psychology
fine
work
so
you
see
there
are
some
unusual
features
in
the
case
said
fuselier
complacently
this
for
instance
why
do
you
suppose
the
fellow
stayed
such
a
long
time
with
the
princess
and
went
through
all
that
comedy
business
in
the
bathroom
do
forget
that
she
came
in
late
and
it
is
extremely
probable
that
he
might
have
finished
his
job
before
she
returned
juve
passed
his
hand
through
his
hair
a
characteristic
trick
when
his
mind
was
working
i
can
imagine
only
one
answer
to
that
question
fuselier
but
you
have
inspected
the
scene
of
the
crime
tell
me
first
where
do
you
think
the
rascal
was
hidden
oh
i
can
answer
that
definitely
the
princess
suite
of
rooms
ends
in
the
bathroom
you
know
and
the
chief
things
there
are
the
famous
bath
some
cupboards
and
a
shower
bath
the
shower
bath
is
one
of
those
large
model
norchers
with
lateral
as
well
as
vertical
sprays
and
a
waterproof
curtain
hanging
from
rings
at
the
top
right
down
to
the
tub
at
the
bottom
there
were
footmarks
on
the
enamel
of
the
tub
so
it
is
clear
that
the
thief
hid
there
behind
the
curtain
until
the
princess
got
into
her
bath
and
i
suppose
the
shower
bath
is
in
the
corner
of
the
room
near
the
window
juve
went
on
and
the
window
was
partly
open
or
had
been
until
the
maid
went
in
to
prepare
her
mistress
bath
it
quite
interesting
the
man
had
just
succeeded
in
stealing
the
necklace
from
mme
van
den
rosen
whose
rooms
are
next
to
princess
sonia
for
some
reason
or
other
he
had
not
been
able
to
escape
through
the
corridor
and
so
he
naturally
made
up
his
mind
to
get
into
the
princess
suite
which
he
did
by
the
simple
process
of
stepping
over
the
railing
on
the
balcony
and
walking
in
through
the
open
window
of
the
and
then
nadine
came
in
and
he
had
to
hide
no
no
said
juve
you
are
getting
on
too
fast
if
that
had
been
so
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
all
the
bath
business
besides
the
princess
was
robbed
too
you
know
that
was
not
just
chance
it
was
planned
and
so
if
the
thief
hid
in
the
shower
bath
he
did
so
on
purpose
to
wait
for
the
princess
but
he
did
not
want
her
fuselier
retorted
very
much
the
reverse
if
he
was
in
the
room
before
anybody
else
all
he
had
to
do
was
take
the
and
go
not
a
bit
of
it
said
juve
this
robbery
took
place
at
the
end
of
the
month
when
the
princess
would
have
big
monthly
bills
to
meet
as
the
thief
must
have
known
he
must
have
found
out
that
she
had
withdrawn
her
portfolio
and
money
from
the
custody
of
the
hotel
but
he
must
have
been
ignorant
of
where
she
had
placed
the
portfolio
and
he
waited
for
her
to
ask
her
and
she
told
him
that
a
pretty
tall
yarn
fuselier
protested
what
on
earth
do
you
base
it
all
upon
the
princess
would
never
have
shown
the
man
the
drawer
where
the
money
was
taken
from
yes
she
did
said
juve
look
here
this
is
what
happened
the
fellow
wanted
to
steal
this
and
did
not
know
where
it
was
he
hid
in
the
shower
bath
and
waited
either
for
the
princess
to
go
to
bed
or
take
a
bath
either
of
which
would
place
her
at
his
mercy
when
the
lady
was
in
the
bath
he
appeared
threatened
her
until
she
was
terrified
and
then
bucked
her
up
a
bit
again
and
hit
on
the
dodge
of
putting
out
the
electric
light
not
out
of
respect
for
her
wounded
feelings
but
simply
in
order
to
get
a
chance
to
search
through
her
clothes
and
make
sure
that
the
was
not
there
i
am
convinced
that
if
he
had
found
it
then
he
would
have
bolted
at
once
but
he
did
find
it
so
he
went
to
the
end
of
the
next
room
and
waited
for
the
princess
to
come
to
him
there
which
is
precisely
what
she
did
he
did
not
know
where
the
money
was
so
he
watched
every
movement
of
her
eyes
and
saw
them
go
automatically
towards
the
drawer
and
stay
there
then
he
slipped
his
card
into
the
drawer
abstracted
the
and
took
his
leave
driving
his
impudence
and
skill
to
the
length
of
making
her
see
him
to
the
door
upon
my
word
juve
you
are
a
wonder
fuselier
said
admiringly
i
spent
the
entire
day
everybody
in
the
hotel
and
came
to
no
definite
conclusion
and
you
who
have
not
seen
anything
or
anybody
connected
with
it
sit
in
that
chair
and
in
five
minutes
clear
up
the
entire
mystery
what
a
pity
you
wo
believe
that
fantômas
had
a
finger
in
this
pie
what
a
pity
you
wo
take
up
the
search
juve
paid
no
heed
to
the
compliments
to
his
skill
he
took
out
his
watch
and
looked
at
the
time
i
must
go
he
said
it
quite
time
i
was
at
my
own
work
well
we
may
not
have
been
wasting
our
time
fuselier
i
admit
i
had
not
paid
much
attention
to
the
royal
palace
hotel
robbery
you
have
really
interested
me
in
it
i
wo
make
any
promises
but
i
think
i
shall
very
likely
come
again
in
a
day
or
two
for
another
talk
with
you
about
the
case
it
really
interests
me
now
and
when
once
i
quit
of
one
or
two
pressing
jobs
i
do
say
i
sha
ask
leave
to
go
thoroughly
into
it
with
you
xii
a
blow
the
staff
of
the
royal
palace
hotel
were
just
finishing
dinner
and
the
greatest
animation
prevailed
in
the
vast
servants
hall
the
tone
of
the
conversation
varied
at
different
tables
for
the
servants
jealously
observed
a
strict
order
of
precedence
among
themselves
but
the
present
topic
was
the
same
at
all
the
recent
sensational
robbery
from
mme
van
den
rosen
and
the
princess
sonia
danidoff
at
one
table
smaller
than
the
rest
a
party
of
upper
servants
sat
or
heads
of
departments
louis
was
here
the
general
manager
muller
the
superintendent
of
the
second
floor
ludovic
chief
valet
maurice
head
footman
naud
chief
cashier
and
last
but
not
least
mlle
jeanne
the
young
lady
cashier
whose
special
duty
it
was
to
take
charge
of
all
the
moneys
and
valuables
deposited
in
the
custody
of
the
hotel
by
guests
who
wished
to
relieve
themselves
of
the
responsibility
of
keeping
these
in
their
own
rooms
this
small
and
select
company
was
increased
by
the
addition
of
henri
verbier
a
man
of
about
forty
years
of
age
who
had
left
the
branch
hotel
at
cairo
belonging
to
the
same
company
to
join
the
staff
at
the
royal
palace
hotel
in
paris
i
am
afraid
verbier
you
will
form
a
very
bad
opinion
of
our
establishment
said
muller
to
him
it
is
really
a
pity
that
you
should
have
left
the
cairo
branch
and
come
here
just
when
these
robberies
have
put
the
royal
palace
under
a
cloud
henri
verbier
smiled
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
my
attaching
too
much
importance
to
that
he
said
i
been
in
hotel
life
for
fifteen
years
now
in
one
capacity
or
another
and
as
you
may
suppose
i
known
similar
cases
before
so
they
do
surprise
me
much
but
one
thing
does
surprise
me
muller
and
that
is
that
no
clue
has
yet
been
found
i
suppose
the
board
have
done
everything
that
can
be
done
to
trace
the
culprit
the
reputation
of
the
hotel
is
at
stake
i
should
think
they
have
looked
for
him
said
louis
with
a
pathetic
shrug
of
his
shoulders
why
they
even
upbraided
me
for
having
had
the
door
opened
for
the
thief
luckily
i
had
a
good
friend
in
muller
who
admitted
that
he
had
been
completely
imposed
upon
and
that
he
had
given
the
order
for
the
fellow
whom
he
supposed
to
be
the
waiter
to
be
allowed
to
go
out
i
knew
nothing
about
it
and
how
was
i
to
guess
that
the
man
was
an
impostor
muller
protested
all
the
same
henri
verbier
retorted
it
is
uncommonly
annoying
for
everybody
when
things
like
that
happen
so
long
as
one
has
not
committed
any
breach
of
orders
and
so
ca
be
made
a
scapegoat
of
one
must
grumble
muller
said
louis
and
i
did
exactly
what
our
duty
required
and
no
one
can
say
anything
to
us
the
magistrate
acknowledged
that
a
week
ago
he
does
not
suspect
anybody
henri
verbier
asked
no
nobody
muller
answered
louis
smiled
yes
he
did
suspect
somebody
verbier
he
said
and
that
was
your
charming
neighbour
mlle
jeanne
there
verbier
turned
towards
the
young
cashier
what
the
magistrate
tried
to
make
out
that
you
were
implicated
in
it
the
girl
had
only
spoken
a
few
words
during
the
whole
of
dinner
although
henri
verbier
had
made
several
gallant
attempts
to
draw
her
into
the
general
conversation
now
she
laughingly
protested
louis
only
says
that
to
tease
me
but
louis
stuck
to
his
guns
not
a
bit
of
it
mademoiselle
jeanne
i
said
it
because
it
is
the
truth
the
magistrate
was
on
to
you
i
tell
you
he
was
why
verbier
he
her
for
more
than
half
an
hour
after
the
general
confrontation
while
he
finished
with
muller
and
me
in
less
than
ten
minutes
gad
louis
a
magistrate
is
a
man
is
he
said
henri
verbier
gallantly
the
magistrate
may
have
enjoyed
talking
to
mlle
jeanne
more
than
he
did
to
you
if
i
may
suggest
it
without
seeming
rude
there
was
a
general
laugh
at
this
sally
on
the
part
of
the
new
superintendent
and
then
louis
continued
well
if
he
wanted
to
make
up
to
her
he
went
a
funny
way
to
work
for
he
made
her
angry
did
he
really
said
henri
verbier
turning
again
to
the
girl
why
did
the
magistrate
you
so
much
the
young
cashier
shrugged
her
shoulders
we
have
thrashed
it
out
so
often
verbier
but
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
story
during
the
morning
of
the
day
when
the
robbery
was
committed
i
had
returned
to
princess
sonia
danidoff
the
containing
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
francs
which
she
had
given
into
my
custody
a
few
days
before
i
could
not
refuse
to
give
it
to
her
when
she
asked
for
it
could
i
how
was
i
to
know
that
it
would
be
stolen
from
her
the
same
evening
customers
deposit
their
valuables
with
me
and
i
hand
them
a
receipt
they
give
me
back
the
receipt
when
they
demand
their
valuables
and
all
i
have
to
do
is
comply
with
their
request
without
asking
questions
is
that
so
but
that
was
not
what
puzzled
the
magistrate
i
suppose
said
henri
verbier
you
are
the
custodian
of
all
valuables
and
you
only
complied
strictly
with
your
orders
yes
muller
broke
in
but
mlle
jeanne
has
only
told
you
part
of
the
story
just
fancy
only
a
few
minutes
before
the
robbery
mme
van
den
rosen
had
asked
mlle
jeanne
to
take
charge
of
her
diamond
necklace
and
mlle
jeanne
had
refused
that
really
was
bad
luck
for
you
said
henri
verbier
to
the
girl
with
a
laugh
and
i
quite
understand
that
the
magistrate
thought
it
rather
odd
they
are
unkind
she
protested
from
the
way
they
put
it
verbier
you
really
might
think
that
i
refused
to
take
charge
of
mme
van
den
rosen
jewellery
in
order
to
make
things
easy
for
the
thief
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
i
was
his
accomplice
that
is
precisely
what
the
magistrate
did
think
louis
interpolated
the
girl
took
no
notice
of
the
interruption
but
went
on
with
her
explanation
to
henri
verbier
what
happened
was
this
the
rule
is
that
i
am
at
the
disposal
of
customers
to
take
charge
of
deposits
or
to
return
them
to
the
owners
until
nine
and
until
nine
only
after
that
my
time
is
up
and
all
i
have
to
do
is
lock
my
safe
and
go
i
am
free
until
nine
next
morning
you
know
that
it
does
not
do
to
take
liberties
in
a
position
like
mine
so
when
on
the
day
of
the
robbery
mme
van
den
rosen
came
with
her
diamond
necklace
at
nine
i
was
perfectly
within
my
rights
in
refusing
to
accept
the
deposit
that
right
enough
said
muller
who
having
finished
his
dessert
was
now
sipping
coffee
into
which
he
had
tipped
sugar
until
it
was
as
thick
as
syrup
but
you
were
disobliging
my
dear
young
lady
and
that
was
what
struck
the
magistrate
for
really
it
would
not
have
been
much
trouble
to
register
the
new
deposit
and
take
charge
of
mme
van
den
rosen
necklace
for
her
no
it
would
the
girl
replied
but
when
there
is
a
rule
it
seems
to
me
that
it
ought
to
be
obeyed
my
time
is
up
at
nine
and
i
am
forbidden
to
accept
any
deposits
after
nine
and
that
why
i
refused
that
lady
i
was
perfectly
right
and
i
should
do
the
same
again
if
the
same
thing
happened
henri
verbier
was
manifestly
anxious
to
conciliate
the
young
cashier
he
expressed
his
approval
of
her
conduct
now
i
quite
agree
with
you
it
never
does
to
put
interpretations
upon
orders
it
was
your
duty
to
close
your
safe
at
nine
and
you
did
close
it
then
and
no
one
can
say
anything
to
you
but
joking
apart
what
did
the
magistrate
want
the
girl
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
a
gesture
of
indifference
you
see
i
was
right
just
now
louis
is
only
trying
to
tease
me
by
saying
that
the
magistrate
me
severely
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
simply
asked
what
i
have
just
told
you
and
when
i
gave
all
this
explanation
no
fault
at
all
was
found
with
me
as
she
spoke
mlle
jeanne
folded
her
napkin
carefully
pushed
back
her
chair
and
shook
hands
with
her
two
neighbours
at
table
good
night
she
said
i
am
going
up
to
bed
mlle
jeanne
had
hardly
left
the
room
before
henri
verbier
also
rose
from
the
table
and
prepared
to
follow
her
example
louis
gave
muller
a
friendly
dig
in
his
comfortable
paunch
a
pound
to
a
penny
he
said
that
friend
verbier
means
to
make
up
to
mlle
jeanne
well
i
wish
him
luck
but
that
young
lady
is
not
very
easy
to
tame
you
did
succeed
muller
replied
unkindly
but
it
does
follow
that
nobody
else
will
louis
was
not
deceived
henri
verbier
evidently
did
think
his
neighbour
at
table
a
very
charming
young
woman
mlle
jeanne
had
hardly
reached
her
room
on
the
fifth
floor
of
the
hotel
and
flung
open
her
window
to
gaze
over
the
magnificent
panorama
spread
out
below
her
and
inhale
the
still
night
air
when
a
gentle
tap
fell
upon
the
door
and
complying
with
her
summons
to
come
in
henri
verbier
entered
the
room
my
room
is
next
to
yours
he
said
and
as
i
saw
you
were
standing
dreaming
at
your
window
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
condescend
to
smoke
an
egyptian
cigarette
i
have
brought
some
back
from
cairo
it
is
very
mild
tobacco
real
ladies
tobacco
the
girl
laughed
and
took
a
dainty
cigarette
from
the
case
that
henri
verbier
offered
her
it
very
kind
of
you
to
think
of
me
she
said
i
do
make
a
habit
of
smoking
but
i
let
myself
be
tempted
sometimes
if
i
have
been
kind
you
can
show
your
gratitude
very
easily
henri
verbier
replied
by
allowing
me
to
stay
here
a
few
minutes
and
smoke
a
cigarette
with
you
by
all
means
said
mlle
jeanne
i
love
to
spend
a
little
time
at
my
window
at
night
to
get
the
air
before
going
to
bed
you
will
prevent
me
from
getting
tired
of
my
own
company
and
can
tell
me
all
about
cairo
i
afraid
i
know
very
little
about
cairo
henri
verbier
replied
you
see
i
spent
almost
the
whole
of
my
time
in
the
hotel
but
as
you
seem
so
kind
and
so
friendly
disposed
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
things
but
i
am
a
very
ignorant
young
woman
you
are
a
woman
and
that
enough
listen
i
am
a
here
and
i
am
quite
aware
that
my
arrival
and
my
position
will
make
me
some
enemies
now
whom
ought
i
to
be
on
my
guard
against
who
is
there
among
the
staff
of
whom
i
ought
to
be
careful
as
doubtful
associates
i
ask
with
all
the
more
concern
because
i
will
tell
you
frankly
that
i
had
no
personal
introduction
to
the
board
i
have
not
got
the
same
chance
that
you
have
how
do
you
know
i
had
any
introduction
the
girl
enquired
gad
i
sure
of
it
henri
verbier
answered
he
was
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
and
gradually
drawing
closer
to
the
young
cashier
i
do
suppose
that
an
important
position
like
the
one
you
hold
requiring
absolute
integrity
and
competence
is
given
without
fullest
investigation
your
work
is
not
tiring
but
that
does
not
mean
it
would
be
entrusted
to
anybody
you
are
quite
right
verbier
i
did
have
an
introduction
to
the
board
and
i
had
testimonials
too
have
you
been
in
business
long
two
years
three
years
yes
mlle
jeanne
replied
purposely
refraining
from
being
explicit
i
only
asked
because
i
fancy
i
have
seen
you
before
somewhere
i
recognise
your
eyes
henri
verbier
smiled
and
looked
meaningly
at
the
girl
mlle
jeanne
on
summer
nights
like
this
when
you
are
looking
at
a
lovely
view
like
this
do
you
have
a
funny
sort
of
feeling
no
what
do
you
mean
oh
i
do
know
but
you
see
i
a
sentimental
chap
unfortunately
and
i
really
suffer
a
lot
from
always
living
in
lonely
isolation
without
any
affection
there
are
times
when
i
feel
as
if
love
were
an
absolute
necessity
the
cashier
looked
at
him
ironically
that
all
foolishness
love
is
only
stupid
and
ought
to
be
guarded
against
as
the
worst
possible
mistake
love
always
means
misery
for
working
people
like
us
it
is
you
who
are
foolish
henri
verbier
protested
gently
or
else
you
are
mischievous
no
love
is
not
stupid
for
working
people
like
us
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
only
means
we
have
of
attaining
perfect
happiness
lovers
are
rich
in
wealth
that
lets
them
die
of
hunger
she
scoffed
no
no
he
answered
no
look
here
all
you
and
i
have
been
working
hard
earning
our
living
well
suppose
you
were
not
laughing
at
me
but
we
were
really
lovers
would
not
this
be
the
time
to
enjoy
the
living
we
have
earned
and
as
the
girl
did
not
reply
henri
verbier
who
like
an
experienced
wooer
had
been
drawing
closer
to
her
all
the
time
until
now
his
shoulder
was
touching
hers
took
her
hand
would
not
this
be
sweet
he
said
i
should
take
your
little
fingers
into
mine
like
this
i
should
look
at
them
so
tenderly
and
raise
them
to
my
lips
but
the
girl
wrested
herself
away
let
me
go
i
wo
have
it
do
you
understand
and
then
to
mitigate
the
sharpness
of
her
rebuke
and
also
to
change
the
conversation
she
said
it
is
beginning
to
turn
cold
i
will
put
a
cloak
over
my
shoulders
and
she
moved
away
from
the
window
to
unhook
a
cloak
from
a
peg
on
the
wall
henri
verbier
watched
her
without
moving
how
unkind
you
are
he
said
reproachfully
disregarding
the
angry
gleam
in
her
eyes
can
it
really
be
wrong
to
enjoy
a
kiss
on
a
lovely
night
like
this
if
you
are
cold
mademoiselle
jeanne
there
is
a
better
way
of
getting
warm
than
by
putting
a
wrap
over
one
shoulders
and
that
is
by
resting
in
someone
else
arms
he
put
out
his
arms
as
he
spoke
ready
to
catch
the
girl
as
she
came
across
the
room
and
was
on
the
very
point
of
taking
her
into
his
arms
as
he
had
suggested
when
she
broke
from
his
grasp
with
a
sudden
turn
and
furious
with
rage
dealt
him
a
tremendous
blow
right
on
the
temple
with
a
stifled
groan
henri
verbier
dropped
unconscious
to
the
floor
mlle
jeanne
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
as
if
dumbfounded
then
with
quite
amazing
rapidity
the
young
cashier
sprang
to
the
window
and
hurriedly
closed
it
she
took
down
her
hat
from
a
hook
on
the
wall
and
put
it
on
with
a
single
gesture
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
little
bag
and
then
after
listening
for
a
minute
to
make
sure
that
there
was
nobody
in
the
passage
outside
her
room
she
opened
her
door
went
out
rapidly
turned
the
key
behind
her
and
ran
down
the
stairs
two
minutes
later
mlle
jeanne
smilingly
passed
the
porter
on
duty
and
wished
him
good
night
she
said
i
going
out
to
get
a
little
fresh
air
slowly
as
if
emerging
from
some
extraordinary
dream
henri
verbier
began
to
recover
from
his
brief
unconsciousness
he
could
not
understand
at
first
what
had
happened
to
him
why
he
was
lying
on
the
floor
why
his
head
ached
so
much
or
why
his
eyes
saw
everything
through
a
mist
he
gradually
struggled
into
a
sitting
posture
and
looked
around
the
room
nobody
here
he
muttered
then
as
if
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
had
brought
him
back
to
life
he
got
up
and
hurried
to
the
door
and
shook
it
furiously
locked
he
growled
angrily
and
i
can
call
till
i
black
in
the
face
no
one
has
come
upstairs
yet
i
trapped
he
turned
towards
the
window
with
some
idea
of
calling
for
help
but
as
he
passed
the
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
he
caught
sight
of
his
own
reflection
and
saw
the
bruise
on
his
forehead
with
a
tiny
stream
of
blood
beginning
to
trickle
from
a
cut
in
the
skin
he
went
close
to
the
glass
and
looked
at
himself
in
dismay
juve
though
i
am
he
murmured
let
myself
be
knocked
out
by
a
woman
and
then
juve
for
juve
it
was
cleverly
disguised
uttered
a
sudden
oath
clenching
his
fists
and
grinding
his
teeth
in
rage
confound
it
all
i
take
my
oath
that
blow
was
never
dealt
by
any
woman
xiii
thérèse
future
etienne
rambert
was
in
the
of
the
house
which
he
had
purchased
a
few
months
previously
in
the
place
pereire
rue
smoking
and
chatting
with
his
old
friend
barbey
who
also
was
his
banker
the
two
had
been
discussing
investments
and
the
wealthy
merchant
had
displayed
considerable
indifference
to
the
recommendation
of
various
securities
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
dear
fellow
he
said
at
length
these
things
interest
me
very
little
i
got
used
to
big
enterprises
am
almost
what
you
would
call
a
plunger
of
course
you
know
that
nothing
is
so
risky
as
the
development
of
rubber
plantations
no
doubt
the
industry
has
prospered
amazingly
since
the
boom
in
began
but
you
must
remember
that
i
went
into
it
when
no
one
could
possibly
foresee
the
immense
market
that
the
new
means
of
locomotion
would
open
for
our
produce
that
enough
to
prove
to
you
that
i
no
coward
when
it
a
question
of
risking
money
the
banker
nodded
his
friend
certainly
did
display
a
quite
extraordinary
energy
and
for
a
man
of
his
age
as
a
matter
of
fact
rambert
went
on
any
business
of
which
i
am
not
actually
a
director
interests
me
only
slightly
you
know
i
am
not
boasting
when
i
say
that
my
fortune
is
large
enough
to
justify
me
in
incurring
a
certain
amount
of
financial
risk
without
having
to
fear
any
serious
modification
of
my
social
position
if
the
ventures
should
happen
to
turn
out
ill
i
got
the
sporting
instinct
it
a
fine
one
barbey
said
with
some
enthusiasm
and
i
mind
telling
you
that
if
i
were
not
your
banker
and
so
had
a
certain
responsibility
in
your
case
i
should
not
hesitate
to
put
a
scheme
before
you
that
has
been
running
in
my
head
for
a
year
or
two
now
a
scheme
of
your
own
barbey
said
rambert
how
is
it
you
have
never
told
me
about
it
i
should
have
thought
we
were
close
enough
friends
for
that
the
hint
of
reproach
in
the
words
pricked
the
banker
and
also
encouraged
him
to
proceed
it
rather
a
delicate
matter
and
you
will
understand
my
hesitation
when
i
tell
you
for
i
burn
my
boats
now
that
it
is
any
ordinary
speculation
such
as
i
am
in
the
habit
of
recommending
to
my
customers
it
is
a
speculation
in
which
i
am
interested
personally
in
short
i
want
to
increase
the
capital
of
my
bank
and
convert
my
house
into
a
really
large
concern
said
etienne
rambert
half
to
himself
well
you
are
quite
right
barbey
but
if
you
want
to
suggest
that
i
shall
help
to
finance
it
you
had
better
put
all
the
cards
on
the
table
and
let
me
know
exactly
what
the
position
is
i
need
not
say
that
if
nothing
comes
of
it
i
shall
regard
any
information
you
give
me
as
absolutely
confidential
the
two
men
plunged
into
the
subject
and
for
a
good
discussed
it
in
all
its
bearings
making
endless
calculations
and
contemplating
all
contingencies
at
last
rambert
threw
down
his
pen
and
looked
up
i
accustomed
to
the
american
method
of
hustle
barbey
in
principle
i
like
your
proposition
quite
well
but
i
wo
be
one
of
your
financial
partners
if
the
thing
goes
through
i
be
the
only
one
or
not
one
at
all
i
know
what
is
in
your
mind
he
went
on
with
a
smile
as
he
noticed
the
banker
surprise
you
know
what
my
fortune
is
or
rather
you
think
you
do
and
you
are
wondering
where
i
shall
get
the
million
sterling
or
thereabouts
that
you
want
well
make
your
mind
easy
about
that
if
i
talk
like
this
it
because
i
got
it
the
banker
bow
was
very
deferent
and
rambert
continued
yes
the
last
year
or
two
have
been
good
even
very
good
for
me
i
made
some
lucky
speculations
and
my
capital
has
further
been
increased
by
some
lotteries
which
have
turned
out
right
quite
lately
well
he
broke
off
with
a
sigh
i
suppose
one
ca
always
be
unlucky
in
everything
though
money
ca
cure
or
even
touch
the
wounds
in
one
heart
the
banker
made
no
answer
he
shrank
from
waking
by
untimely
words
the
sad
memories
which
were
hardly
dormant
yet
in
the
old
man
mind
but
rambert
soon
reverted
to
his
business
tone
i
quite
disposed
to
be
interested
in
a
financial
venture
like
yours
barbey
but
you
must
understand
that
you
will
have
a
good
deal
more
than
a
sleeping
partner
in
me
will
that
suit
you
i
should
not
ask
you
to
abdicate
your
authority
but
i
tell
you
frankly
i
should
follow
all
the
operations
of
your
house
very
closely
indeed
there
shall
be
no
secrets
from
you
my
dear
friend
my
dear
partner
if
i
may
call
you
that
said
barbey
rising
quite
the
contrary
the
banker
looked
towards
the
mantelpiece
as
if
expecting
to
see
a
clock
there
rambert
understood
the
instinctive
action
and
drew
out
his
watch
twenty
minutes
to
eleven
barbey
late
hours
for
you
so
off
with
you
he
cut
short
the
banker
apologies
for
not
prolonging
the
evening
i
am
turning
you
out
quite
unceremoniously
my
dear
chap
and
besides
as
you
know
i
not
lonely
as
i
generally
am
i
have
a
young
and
very
charming
companion
for
whom
i
have
the
greatest
possible
affection
and
i
am
going
to
join
her
etienne
rambert
conducted
his
friend
to
the
hall
door
heard
the
sound
of
his
die
away
in
the
distance
and
then
walked
across
the
hall
and
instead
of
going
back
to
the
turned
into
the
adjoining
he
paused
for
a
moment
in
the
doorway
tenderly
contemplating
the
charming
spectacle
that
met
his
eyes
the
shaded
light
from
an
electric
lamp
fell
upon
the
bent
head
oval
face
and
delicate
features
of
thérèse
auvernois
who
was
intent
upon
a
book
the
girl
was
emerging
from
childhood
into
young
womanhood
now
and
sorrow
had
heightened
her
natural
distinction
by
giving
her
a
stamp
of
gravity
that
was
new
her
figure
showed
slight
and
supple
delicate
and
graceful
and
her
long
tapered
fingers
turned
over
the
pages
of
the
book
with
slow
and
regular
movement
thérèse
looked
round
towards
etienne
rambert
when
she
heard
him
coming
in
and
laying
down
her
book
she
came
forward
to
meet
him
moving
with
a
very
graceful
easy
carriage
i
am
sure
i
am
keeping
you
up
most
dreadfully
late
dear
rambert
she
said
apologetically
but
what
am
i
to
do
i
must
wait
for
the
baronne
de
vibray
and
the
dear
thing
is
so
often
late
the
tragedy
at
the
château
of
beaulieu
had
had
one
effect
in
knitting
all
the
friends
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
in
closer
bonds
of
friendship
prior
to
that
event
etienne
rambert
had
scarcely
known
the
baronne
de
vibray
now
the
two
were
intimate
friends
the
baronne
had
not
desisted
from
her
first
generous
effort
until
she
had
persuaded
the
family
council
to
appoint
her
guardian
of
the
orphaned
thérèse
auvernois
at
first
she
had
installed
the
child
at
querelles
and
remained
there
with
her
leading
the
quietest
possible
life
partly
out
of
respect
for
thérèse
grief
and
partly
because
she
herself
was
also
much
upset
by
the
distressing
tragedy
she
had
even
enjoyed
the
rest
and
her
new
interest
in
playing
mother
or
rather
elder
sister
to
thérèse
but
as
the
weeks
went
by
and
time
accomplished
its
healing
work
paris
called
to
the
baronne
once
more
and
yielding
to
the
solicitations
of
her
many
friends
she
brought
her
new
ward
to
the
capital
and
settled
in
a
little
flat
in
the
rue
at
first
she
protested
that
she
would
go
out
nowhere
or
at
most
pay
only
absolutely
necessary
visits
but
by
degrees
she
accepted
first
one
and
then
many
invitations
though
always
deploring
the
necessity
of
leaving
thérèse
for
several
hours
at
a
time
happily
there
was
always
etienne
rambert
who
was
also
staying
in
paris
just
now
it
had
gradually
become
the
custom
of
the
baronne
de
vibray
when
she
was
dining
out
to
entrust
thérèse
to
etienne
rambert
care
and
the
young
girl
and
the
old
man
got
on
together
perfectly
their
hearts
had
met
across
the
awful
chasm
that
fate
had
tried
to
cut
between
them
to
thérèse
last
words
now
etienne
rambert
replied
you
need
not
apologise
for
staying
late
dear
you
know
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
i
wish
the
house
were
yours
the
girl
glanced
round
the
room
that
had
grown
so
familiar
to
her
and
with
a
sudden
rush
of
feeling
slipped
her
arm
around
the
old
man
neck
and
laid
her
fair
head
on
his
shoulder
i
should
so
love
to
stay
here
with
you
m
rambert
the
old
man
looked
oddly
at
her
for
a
moment
repressing
the
words
that
he
might
perhaps
have
wished
to
say
and
then
gently
released
himself
from
her
affectionate
clasp
and
led
her
to
a
sofa
on
which
he
sat
down
by
her
side
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
we
must
not
allow
ourselves
to
think
about
my
dear
he
said
i
should
have
rejoiced
to
receive
you
in
my
home
and
your
presence
and
the
brightness
of
your
dear
fair
face
would
have
given
a
charm
to
my
lonely
fireside
but
unfortunately
those
are
vain
dreams
we
have
to
reckon
with
the
world
and
the
world
would
not
approve
of
a
young
girl
like
you
living
in
the
home
of
a
lonely
man
why
not
thérèse
enquired
in
surprise
why
you
might
be
my
father
etienne
rambert
winced
at
the
word
ah
he
said
you
must
not
forget
thérèse
that
i
am
not
your
father
but
his
the
father
of
him
who
but
thérèse
soft
hand
laid
upon
his
lips
prevented
him
from
finishing
what
he
would
have
said
to
change
the
conversation
thérèse
feigned
concern
about
her
own
future
when
we
left
querelles
she
said
president
bonnet
told
me
that
you
would
tell
me
something
about
my
affairs
i
gather
that
my
fortune
is
not
a
very
brilliant
one
it
was
indeed
the
fact
that
after
the
murder
of
the
marquise
the
unpleasant
discovery
had
been
made
that
her
fortune
was
by
no
means
so
considerable
as
had
generally
been
supposed
the
estate
was
mortgaged
and
president
bonnet
and
etienne
rambert
had
had
long
and
anxious
debates
as
to
whether
it
might
not
be
well
for
thérèse
to
renounce
her
inheritance
to
beaulieu
so
doubtful
did
it
seem
whether
the
assets
would
exceed
the
liabilities
etienne
rambert
made
a
vague
but
significant
gesture
when
he
heard
the
girl
raise
the
point
now
but
thérèse
had
all
the
carelessness
of
youth
oh
i
shall
not
be
she
exclaimed
my
poor
grannie
always
gave
me
an
example
of
energy
and
hard
work
i
got
plenty
of
pluck
and
i
will
work
too
suppose
i
turn
governess
rambert
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
my
dear
child
i
know
how
brave
and
earnest
you
are
and
that
gives
me
confidence
i
have
thought
about
your
future
a
great
deal
already
some
day
of
course
some
nice
and
wealthy
young
fellow
will
come
along
and
marry
you
oh
yes
he
will
you
see
but
in
the
meantime
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
have
some
occupation
i
am
wondering
whether
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
let
or
even
to
sell
beaulieu
and
on
the
other
hand
you
ca
always
stay
with
the
baronne
de
vibray
no
i
realise
that
said
thérèse
who
with
the
native
tact
that
was
one
of
her
best
qualities
had
quickly
seen
that
it
would
not
be
long
before
she
would
become
a
difficulty
in
the
way
of
the
independence
of
the
kind
baronne
that
is
what
troubles
me
most
your
birth
and
your
upbringing
have
been
such
that
you
would
certainly
suffer
much
in
taking
up
the
difficult
and
delicate
and
sometimes
painful
position
of
governess
in
a
family
and
without
wishing
to
be
offensive
i
must
remind
you
that
you
need
to
have
studied
very
hard
to
be
a
governess
nowadays
and
i
am
not
aware
that
you
are
exactly
a
but
i
have
an
idea
and
this
is
it
for
a
great
many
years
now
i
have
been
on
the
very
friendliest
terms
with
a
lady
who
belongs
to
the
very
best
english
society
lady
beltham
you
may
perhaps
have
heard
me
speak
of
her
thérèse
opened
wide
eyes
of
astonishment
and
rambert
went
on
a
few
months
ago
lady
beltham
lost
her
husband
in
strange
circumstances
and
since
then
she
has
been
good
enough
to
give
me
more
of
her
confidence
than
previously
she
is
immensely
rich
and
very
charitable
and
i
have
frequently
been
asked
by
her
to
look
after
some
of
her
many
financial
interests
now
i
have
often
noticed
that
she
has
with
her
several
young
english
ladies
who
live
with
her
not
as
companions
but
shall
i
say
secretaries
do
you
understand
the
difference
she
treats
them
like
friends
or
relatives
and
they
all
belong
to
the
very
best
social
class
some
of
them
indeed
being
daughters
of
english
peers
if
lady
beltham
to
whom
i
could
speak
about
it
would
admit
you
into
her
little
company
i
am
sure
you
would
be
in
a
most
delightful
and
lady
beltham
whom
i
know
you
would
please
would
almost
certainly
interest
herself
in
your
future
she
knows
what
unhappiness
is
as
well
as
you
do
my
dear
he
added
bending
fondly
over
the
girl
and
she
would
understand
you
dear
m
rambert
murmured
thérèse
much
moved
do
that
speak
to
lady
beltham
about
me
i
should
be
so
glad
thérèse
did
not
finish
all
she
would
have
said
a
loud
ring
at
the
front
door
bell
broke
in
upon
her
words
and
etienne
rambert
rose
and
walked
across
the
room
that
must
be
the
good
baronne
de
vibray
come
for
you
he
said
xiv
mademoiselle
jeanne
after
she
had
so
roughly
disposed
of
the
enterprising
henri
verbier
whose
most
unseemly
advances
had
so
greatly
scandalised
her
mlle
jeanne
took
to
her
heels
directly
she
was
out
of
sight
of
the
royal
palace
hotel
and
ran
like
one
possessed
she
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
brilliantly
lighted
avenue
wagram
shaking
with
excitement
and
with
palpitating
heart
and
then
mechanically
hailed
a
passing
cab
and
told
the
driver
to
take
her
towards
the
bois
there
she
gave
another
heedless
order
to
go
to
the
boulevard
but
as
the
cab
approached
the
place
de
she
realised
that
she
was
once
more
near
the
royal
palace
hotel
and
stopping
the
driver
by
the
tram
lines
she
dismissed
him
and
got
into
a
tram
that
was
going
to
the
station
of
auteuil
it
was
just
eleven
when
she
reached
the
station
when
is
the
next
train
for
she
asked
she
learned
that
one
was
starting
almost
at
once
and
hurriedly
taking
a
ticket
she
jumped
into
a
ladies
carriage
and
went
as
far
as
courcelles
there
she
alighted
went
out
of
the
station
looked
around
her
for
a
minute
or
two
to
get
her
bearings
and
then
walked
slowly
towards
the
rue
she
hesitated
a
second
and
then
walked
firmly
towards
a
particular
house
and
rang
the
bell
a
lady
to
see
you
sir
the
footman
said
to
rambert
bring
her
in
here
at
once
said
rambert
supposing
that
the
man
had
kept
the
baronne
de
vibray
waiting
in
the
anteroom
the
door
was
opened
a
little
way
and
someone
came
in
and
stepped
quickly
into
the
shadow
by
the
door
thérèse
who
had
risen
to
hurry
towards
the
visitor
stopped
short
when
she
perceived
that
it
was
a
stranger
and
not
her
guardian
noticing
her
action
etienne
rambert
turned
and
looked
at
the
person
who
had
entered
it
was
a
lady
to
what
am
i
indebted
he
began
with
a
bow
and
then
having
approached
the
visitor
he
broke
off
short
good
heavens
the
bell
rang
a
second
time
and
on
this
occasion
the
baronne
de
vibray
hurried
into
the
room
a
radiant
incarnation
of
gaiety
i
am
most
dreadfully
late
she
exclaimed
and
was
hurrying
towards
etienne
rambert
with
outstretched
hands
full
of
some
amusing
story
she
had
to
tell
him
when
she
too
caught
sight
of
the
strange
lady
standing
stiffly
in
the
corner
of
the
room
with
downcast
eyes
etienne
rambert
repressed
his
first
emotion
smiled
to
the
baronne
and
then
went
towards
the
mysterious
lady
madame
he
said
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
moving
may
i
trouble
you
to
come
into
my
study
who
is
that
lady
m
rambert
said
thérèse
when
presently
rambert
came
back
into
the
and
how
white
you
are
rambert
forced
a
smile
i
am
rather
tired
dear
i
have
had
a
great
deal
to
do
these
last
few
days
the
baronne
de
vibray
was
full
of
instant
apologies
it
is
all
my
fault
she
exclaimed
i
am
dreadfully
sorry
to
have
kept
you
up
so
late
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
baronne
car
was
speeding
towards
the
rue
rambert
hurried
back
to
his
study
shut
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
and
almost
sprang
towards
the
unknown
lady
his
fists
clenched
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
charles
he
exclaimed
papa
the
girl
replied
and
sank
upon
a
sofa
there
was
silence
etienne
rambert
seemed
utterly
dumbfounded
i
wo
i
wo
remain
disguised
as
a
woman
any
longer
i
done
with
it
i
can
not
bear
it
the
strange
creature
murmured
you
must
said
rambert
harshly
imperiously
i
insist
the
pseudo
mlle
jeanne
slowly
took
off
the
heavy
wig
that
concealed
her
real
features
and
tore
away
the
corsage
that
compressed
her
bosom
revealing
the
strong
and
muscular
frame
of
a
young
man
no
i
will
not
replied
the
strange
individual
to
whom
rambert
had
not
hesitated
to
give
the
name
of
charles
i
would
rather
anything
else
happened
you
have
got
to
expiate
etienne
rambert
said
with
the
same
harshness
the
expiation
is
too
great
the
young
fellow
answered
the
torture
is
unendurable
charles
said
rambert
very
gravely
do
you
forget
that
legally
civilly
you
are
dead
i
would
a
thousand
times
rather
be
really
dead
the
unhappy
lad
exclaimed
alas
his
father
murmured
speaking
very
fast
i
thought
your
mind
was
more
unhinged
than
it
really
is
i
saved
your
life
regardless
of
all
risk
because
i
thought
you
were
insane
and
now
i
know
you
are
a
criminal
oh
yes
i
know
things
i
know
your
life
father
said
charles
rambert
with
so
stern
and
determined
an
expression
that
etienne
rambert
felt
a
moment
fear
i
want
to
know
first
of
all
how
you
managed
to
save
my
life
and
make
out
that
i
was
dead
was
that
just
chance
or
was
it
planned
deliberately
confronted
with
this
new
firmness
of
his
son
etienne
rambert
dropped
his
peremptory
tone
his
shoulders
drooped
in
distress
can
one
anticipate
things
like
that
he
said
when
we
parted
my
heart
bled
to
think
that
you
my
son
must
fall
into
the
hands
of
justice
and
that
your
feet
must
tread
the
path
that
led
to
the
scaffold
or
at
least
to
the
galleys
i
wondered
how
i
could
save
you
then
chance
chance
mark
you
brought
that
poor
drowned
body
in
my
way
i
saw
the
fortunate
coincidence
of
a
faint
resemblance
and
resolved
to
pass
it
off
for
you
i
got
those
woman
clothes
which
you
exchanged
for
yours
buried
the
dead
man
clothes
and
put
yours
on
the
corpse
do
you
know
charles
that
i
have
suffered
too
do
you
know
what
agony
and
torture
i
as
a
man
of
honour
have
endured
have
you
not
heard
the
story
of
my
appearance
at
the
assizes
and
of
my
humiliation
in
court
you
did
all
that
charles
rambert
murmured
strange
chance
indeed
then
his
tone
changed
and
he
sobbed
oh
my
poor
father
what
an
awful
fatality
it
all
is
suddenly
he
sprang
to
his
feet
but
i
committed
no
crime
papa
i
never
killed
the
marquise
de
langrune
oh
do
believe
me
why
you
have
just
this
minute
said
that
you
know
i
am
not
mad
etienne
rambert
looked
at
his
son
with
distress
not
mad
my
poor
boy
yet
perhaps
you
were
mad
then
then
he
stopped
abruptly
do
let
us
go
over
all
that
again
i
forbid
it
absolutely
he
leaned
back
on
his
folded
his
arms
and
asked
sternly
have
you
come
here
only
to
tell
me
that
the
curt
question
seemed
to
affect
the
lad
strangely
all
his
former
audacity
dropped
from
him
nervously
he
stammered
i
ca
remain
a
woman
any
longer
why
not
snapped
etienne
rambert
i
ca
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
as
if
trying
to
read
one
another
thoughts
then
etienne
rambert
seemed
to
see
the
inner
meaning
of
the
words
his
son
had
just
said
i
see
he
answered
slowly
i
understand
the
royal
palace
hotel
where
mlle
jeanne
held
a
trusted
post
has
just
been
the
scene
of
a
daring
robbery
obviously
if
anyone
could
prove
that
charles
rambert
and
the
new
cashier
were
one
and
the
same
person
but
the
young
fellow
understood
the
insinuation
and
burst
out
i
did
not
commit
that
robbery
you
did
etienne
rambert
insisted
you
did
i
read
the
newspaper
accounts
of
the
robbery
read
them
with
all
the
agony
that
only
a
father
like
me
with
a
son
like
you
could
feel
the
detectives
and
the
magistrates
were
at
a
loss
to
find
the
key
to
the
mystery
but
i
saw
clearly
and
at
once
what
the
solution
of
the
mystery
was
and
i
knew
and
understood
because
i
knew
it
was
you
i
did
not
commit
the
robbery
charles
rambert
shouted
do
you
mean
to
begin
all
your
horrible
insinuations
again
as
you
did
at
beaulieu
he
demanded
in
almost
threatening
tones
what
evil
spirit
obsesses
you
why
will
you
insist
that
your
unhappy
son
is
a
criminal
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
those
robberies
at
the
hotel
i
swear
i
had
not
father
rambert
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
clasped
his
hands
what
have
i
done
he
muttered
to
have
so
heavy
a
cross
laid
on
me
he
turned
again
to
his
son
your
defence
is
childish
what
is
the
use
of
mere
denials
words
do
mean
anything
without
proofs
to
support
them
the
lad
was
silent
seeming
to
think
it
useless
to
attempt
to
convince
a
father
who
appeared
so
certain
of
his
guilt
and
also
crushed
by
the
thought
of
all
that
had
happened
at
the
hotel
his
father
betrayed
some
uneasiness
at
a
new
thought
that
had
come
into
his
mind
i
told
you
not
to
come
to
me
again
except
as
a
last
resource
when
punishment
was
actually
overtaking
you
or
when
you
had
proved
your
innocence
why
are
you
here
now
has
something
happened
that
i
do
not
know
about
what
has
happened
what
else
have
you
done
speak
charles
rambert
answered
in
a
toneless
voice
as
if
hypnotised
there
has
been
a
detective
in
the
hotel
for
the
last
few
days
he
called
himself
henri
verbier
and
was
disguised
but
i
knew
him
for
i
had
seen
him
too
lately
and
in
circumstances
too
deeply
impressed
upon
my
mind
for
me
to
be
able
to
forget
him
although
i
only
saw
him
then
for
a
few
minutes
what
do
you
mean
said
the
elder
man
uneasily
i
mean
that
juve
was
at
the
royal
palace
hotel
juve
exclaimed
etienne
rambert
and
then
go
on
juve
disguised
as
henri
verbier
subjected
me
to
a
kind
of
examination
and
i
do
know
what
conclusion
he
came
to
then
this
evening
barely
two
hours
ago
he
came
up
to
my
room
and
had
a
long
talk
and
while
he
was
trying
to
get
some
information
from
me
about
a
matter
that
i
know
nothing
about
for
i
swear
papa
that
i
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
robbery
he
came
up
to
me
and
took
hold
of
me
as
a
man
does
when
he
wants
to
make
up
to
a
woman
and
i
lost
my
head
i
felt
that
in
another
minute
all
would
be
up
with
me
that
he
would
establish
my
identity
which
he
perhaps
suspected
already
and
i
thought
of
all
you
had
done
to
save
my
life
by
representing
that
i
was
dead
and
charles
paused
for
breath
his
father
fists
were
clenched
and
his
face
contracted
go
on
he
said
go
on
but
speak
lower
as
juve
came
close
charles
went
on
i
dealt
him
a
terrific
blow
on
the
forehead
and
he
fell
like
a
stone
and
i
got
away
is
he
dead
etienne
rambert
whispered
i
do
know
for
ten
minutes
charles
rambert
remained
alone
in
the
study
where
his
father
had
left
him
thinking
deeply
then
the
door
opened
and
etienne
rambert
came
back
carrying
a
bundle
of
clothes
there
you
are
he
said
to
his
son
here
are
some
man
clothes
put
them
on
and
go
the
young
man
hastily
took
off
his
woman
garments
and
dressed
himself
in
silence
while
his
father
walked
up
and
down
the
room
plunged
in
deepest
thought
twice
he
asked
are
you
quite
sure
it
was
juve
and
twice
his
son
replied
quite
sure
and
once
again
etienne
rambert
asked
in
tones
that
betrayed
his
keen
anxiety
did
you
kill
him
and
charles
rambert
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
replied
i
told
you
before
i
do
not
know
and
now
charles
rambert
stood
upon
the
threshold
of
the
house
about
to
leave
his
father
without
a
word
of
farewell
or
parting
embrace
etienne
rambert
stayed
him
holding
out
a
filled
full
with
there
take
that
he
said
and
go
xv
the
mad
woman
plot
when
biron
built
his
famous
private
asylum
in
the
very
heart
of
passy
intended
according
to
his
prospectus
to
provide
a
retreat
for
people
suffering
from
nervous
breakdown
or
from
overwork
or
and
to
offer
hospital
treatment
to
the
insane
in
order
to
secure
a
kind
of
official
sanction
for
his
institution
he
took
the
wise
precaution
to
proclaim
from
the
housetops
that
he
would
enlist
the
services
of
officers
of
the
hospitals
the
idea
was
a
shrewd
and
a
successful
one
and
his
establishment
throve
perret
and
sembadel
were
having
breakfast
and
also
were
grumbling
i
should
curse
the
meanness
of
the
management
quite
so
much
if
they
did
put
us
on
to
all
the
jobs
said
sembadel
hang
it
all
man
we
are
both
qualified
and
when
we
undertook
to
assist
biron
we
did
so
i
presume
in
order
to
top
off
our
theoretical
training
with
some
practical
clinical
experience
who
stopping
you
perret
enquired
how
can
we
find
the
time
when
besides
all
our
actual
work
with
the
patients
we
have
to
do
all
this
administrative
work
writing
to
people
to
say
how
the
patients
are
and
all
that
that
ought
to
be
done
by
clerks
not
by
us
is
one
job
as
good
as
another
perret
retorted
besides
we
are
the
only
people
who
know
how
the
patients
really
are
so
it
common
sense
that
we
should
have
to
write
to
their
friends
they
might
let
us
have
a
secretary
anyhow
sembadel
growled
perret
saw
that
his
friend
was
in
a
bad
temper
so
did
not
try
to
carry
on
the
argument
say
he
said
you
ought
to
make
a
special
note
of
that
case
of
no
for
your
thesis
she
was
in
your
ward
for
about
six
months
she
no
said
sembadel
yes
i
know
a
woman
named
rambert
age
about
forty
hallucination
that
people
are
persecuting
her
anæmic
with
alternate
crises
of
excitement
and
melancholia
punctuated
by
fits
of
passion
treatment
rest
nourishment
anodynes
you
evidently
remember
the
case
distinctly
she
interested
me
she
has
marvellous
eyes
well
what
about
her
why
when
she
was
moved
into
my
pavilion
the
diagnosis
was
bad
and
the
prognosis
very
bad
she
was
supposed
to
be
incurable
just
go
and
see
her
now
her
brain
is
restored
she
a
new
woman
he
came
to
the
table
and
picked
up
some
notepaper
i
wrote
to
her
husband
a
day
or
two
ago
and
told
him
he
might
expect
to
hear
that
his
wife
had
recovered
but
i
imagine
my
letter
miscarried
for
i
had
no
answer
i
have
a
good
mind
to
write
to
him
again
and
ask
for
permission
to
send
her
to
the
convalescent
home
the
mischief
of
it
is
that
this
etienne
rambert
may
want
to
remove
her
altogether
and
that
would
mean
one
paying
patient
less
which
would
put
our
worthy
director
in
a
bad
temper
for
a
month
he
turned
to
his
correspondence
and
for
some
minutes
the
silence
in
the
room
was
only
broken
by
the
scratching
of
pens
on
paper
then
an
attendant
came
in
bringing
a
quantity
of
letters
perret
picked
them
up
and
began
to
sort
them
out
none
for
you
he
said
to
sembadel
not
one
of
those
little
mauve
envelopes
which
you
look
for
every
day
and
which
decide
what
your
temper
will
be
i
must
look
out
for
storms
sha
even
have
time
to
grouse
sembadel
growled
again
you
forget
that
swelding
pays
us
an
official
visit
the
danish
professor
is
it
this
morning
that
he
is
coming
so
it
seems
who
is
the
fellow
just
one
of
those
foreign
savants
who
have
succeeded
in
becoming
famous
at
home
and
so
go
abroad
to
worry
other
people
under
a
pretext
of
investigations
that
why
he
wants
to
come
here
wrote
some
beastly
little
pamphlet
on
the
ideontology
of
the
never
heard
of
it
myself
the
conversation
dropped
and
presently
the
two
men
went
off
to
their
wards
to
see
their
patients
and
warn
the
attendants
to
have
everything
in
order
for
the
official
inspection
meantime
in
the
great
elaborate
courtesies
were
being
exchanged
between
biron
and
professor
swelding
biron
was
a
man
of
about
forty
with
a
face
and
an
active
vigorous
frame
he
gesticulated
freely
and
spoke
in
an
unctuous
fawning
tone
i
am
delighted
at
the
great
compliment
you
pay
me
by
coming
here
sir
he
said
when
i
started
this
institution
five
years
ago
i
certainly
did
not
dare
to
hope
that
it
would
so
soon
win
sufficient
reputation
to
entitle
it
to
the
honour
of
inspection
by
men
so
eminent
in
the
scientific
world
as
yourself
the
professor
listened
with
a
courteous
smile
but
evinced
no
hurry
in
replying
professor
swelding
was
certainly
a
remarkable
figure
he
might
have
been
sixty
but
he
bore
very
lightly
the
weight
of
the
years
that
laid
their
snows
upon
his
thick
and
curly
but
startlingly
white
hair
it
was
this
hair
that
attracted
attention
first
it
was
of
extraordinary
thickness
and
was
joined
on
to
a
heavy
moustache
and
a
long
and
massive
beard
he
was
like
a
man
who
might
have
taken
a
vow
never
to
cut
his
hair
it
covered
his
ears
and
grew
low
upon
his
forehead
so
that
hardly
a
vestige
of
the
face
could
be
seen
while
further
all
the
expression
of
the
eyes
was
concealed
behind
large
blue
spectacles
the
professor
was
enveloped
in
a
heavy
cloak
in
spite
of
the
bright
sunshine
evidently
he
was
one
of
those
men
from
the
cold
north
who
do
not
know
what
real
warmth
is
and
have
no
idea
of
what
it
means
to
be
too
thickly
clothed
he
spoke
french
correctly
but
with
a
slight
accent
and
a
slow
enunciation
that
betrayed
a
foreign
origin
i
was
really
anxious
sir
to
observe
for
myself
the
measures
you
have
taken
which
have
set
your
institution
in
the
forefront
of
establishments
of
the
kind
he
replied
i
have
read
with
the
very
greatest
interest
your
various
communications
to
the
transactions
of
learned
societies
it
is
a
great
advantage
for
a
practitioner
like
myself
to
be
able
to
profit
by
the
experience
of
a
savant
of
your
high
standing
a
few
further
compliments
were
exchanged
and
then
biron
suggested
a
visit
to
the
various
wards
and
led
his
guest
out
into
the
grounds
of
the
institution
if
biron
did
not
possess
that
theoretical
knowledge
of
insanity
which
has
made
french
alienists
famous
throughout
the
world
he
was
certainly
a
organiser
his
sanatorium
was
a
model
one
it
was
situated
in
one
of
the
wealthiest
quietest
and
airiest
quarters
of
paris
and
stood
in
a
vast
enclosure
behind
high
walls
within
this
enclosure
a
number
of
small
pavilions
were
built
all
attractive
in
design
and
communicating
by
broad
flights
of
steps
with
a
beautiful
garden
studded
with
trees
and
shrubs
but
further
subdivided
into
a
series
of
little
gardens
separated
from
one
another
by
white
latticed
palings
you
see
professor
i
rely
entirely
on
the
isolation
principle
a
single
block
would
have
involved
a
deleterious
collocation
of
various
types
of
insanity
so
i
built
this
series
of
small
pavilions
where
my
patients
can
be
segregated
according
to
their
type
of
alienation
the
system
has
great
therapeutic
advantages
and
i
am
sure
it
is
the
explanation
of
my
high
percentage
of
cures
professor
swelding
nodded
approval
we
apply
the
system
of
segregation
in
denmark
he
said
but
we
have
never
carried
it
so
far
as
to
divide
the
general
grounds
i
see
that
each
of
your
pavilions
has
its
own
private
garden
i
regard
that
as
indispensable
biron
declared
he
led
his
visitor
to
one
of
the
little
gardens
where
a
man
of
about
fifty
was
walking
about
between
two
attendants
this
man
is
a
megalomaniac
he
said
he
believes
that
he
is
the
almighty
what
is
your
treatment
here
professor
swelding
enquired
i
am
aware
that
the
books
prescribe
isolation
but
that
is
not
sufficient
by
itself
i
nurse
the
brain
by
nursing
the
body
biron
replied
i
build
up
my
patient
system
by
careful
attention
to
hygiene
diet
and
rest
and
i
pretend
to
ignore
his
mental
alienation
there
is
always
a
spark
of
sound
sense
in
a
diseased
brain
this
man
imagines
he
is
the
almighty
but
when
he
is
hungry
he
has
to
ask
for
something
to
eat
and
then
we
pretend
to
wonder
why
he
has
any
need
to
eat
if
he
is
the
almighty
he
has
to
concoct
some
explanation
and
very
gradually
his
reasoning
power
is
restored
a
man
ceases
to
be
insane
the
moment
he
begins
to
comprehend
that
he
is
insane
the
professor
followed
the
doctor
casting
curious
eyes
at
the
various
patients
who
were
walking
in
their
gardens
have
you
many
cures
that
is
a
difficult
question
to
answer
said
biron
the
statistics
are
so
very
different
in
the
different
categories
of
insanity
of
course
said
professor
swelding
but
take
some
particular
type
of
dementia
say
hallucination
of
persecution
what
percentage
of
cures
can
you
show
there
twenty
per
cent
absolute
recoveries
and
forty
per
cent
definite
improvements
the
doctor
replied
promptly
and
as
the
professor
evinced
unmistakable
astonishment
at
so
high
a
percentage
biron
took
him
familiarly
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
along
i
will
show
you
a
patient
who
actually
is
to
be
sent
home
in
a
day
or
two
i
believe
that
she
is
completely
cured
or
on
the
very
point
of
being
completely
cured
a
woman
of
about
forty
was
sitting
in
one
of
the
gardens
by
the
side
of
an
attendant
quietly
sewing
biron
paused
to
draw
his
particular
attention
to
her
that
lady
belongs
to
one
of
the
best
of
our
great
merchant
families
she
is
mme
alice
rambert
wife
of
etienne
rambert
the
rubber
merchant
she
has
been
under
my
care
for
nearly
ten
months
when
she
came
here
she
was
in
the
last
stage
of
debility
and
anæmia
and
suffered
from
the
most
characteristic
hallucination
of
all
she
thought
that
assassins
were
all
round
her
i
have
built
up
her
physical
system
and
now
i
have
cured
her
mind
at
the
present
moment
that
lady
is
not
mad
at
all
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
term
she
never
shows
any
symptoms
of
reverting
to
her
morbid
condition
professor
swelding
enquired
with
interest
never
and
would
not
even
if
violently
upset
i
do
not
think
so
may
i
talk
to
her
certainly
and
biron
led
the
visitor
towards
the
seat
on
which
the
patient
was
sitting
madame
rambert
he
said
may
i
present
professor
swelding
to
you
he
has
heard
that
you
are
here
and
would
like
to
pay
his
respects
mme
rambert
put
down
her
needlework
and
rose
and
looked
at
the
danish
professor
i
am
delighted
to
make
the
gentleman
acquaintance
she
said
but
i
should
like
to
know
how
he
was
aware
of
my
existence
my
dear
doctor
i
regret
that
i
can
not
claim
to
know
you
madame
said
professor
swelding
replying
for
biron
but
i
know
that
in
addressing
you
i
shall
be
speaking
to
the
inmate
of
this
institution
who
will
testify
most
warmly
to
the
scientific
skill
and
the
devotion
of
dr
biron
at
all
events
mme
rambert
replied
coldly
he
carries
his
kindness
to
the
extent
of
wishing
his
patients
never
to
be
dull
since
he
brings
unexpected
visitors
to
see
them
the
phrase
was
an
implicit
reproach
of
biron
too
ready
inclination
to
exhibit
his
patients
as
so
many
rare
and
curious
wild
animals
and
it
stung
him
all
the
more
because
he
was
convinced
that
mme
rambert
was
perfectly
sane
he
pretended
not
to
hear
what
she
said
giving
some
order
to
the
attendant
berthe
who
was
standing
respectfully
by
i
understand
madame
professor
swelding
replied
gently
you
object
to
my
visit
as
an
intrusion
mme
rambert
had
picked
up
her
work
and
already
was
sewing
again
but
suddenly
she
sprang
up
so
abruptly
that
the
professor
recoiled
and
exclaimed
sharply
who
called
me
who
called
me
who
the
professor
was
attempting
to
speak
when
the
patient
interrupted
him
oh
she
cried
alice
alice
his
voice
his
voice
go
away
you
frighten
me
who
spoke
go
away
oh
help
help
and
she
fled
screaming
towards
the
far
end
of
the
garden
with
the
attendant
and
biron
running
after
her
with
all
the
cleverness
of
the
insane
she
managed
to
elude
them
and
continued
to
scream
oh
i
recognised
him
do
go
away
i
implore
you
go
murder
murder
the
attendant
tried
to
reassure
the
doctor
do
be
frightened
sir
she
is
not
dangerous
i
expect
the
visit
from
that
gentleman
has
upset
her
the
poor
demented
creature
had
taken
refuge
behind
a
clump
of
shrubs
and
was
standing
there
with
eyes
dilated
with
anguish
fixed
on
the
professor
and
hand
pointing
to
him
trembling
in
every
limb
fantômas
she
cried
fantômas
there
i
know
him
oh
help
the
scene
was
horribly
distressing
and
biron
put
an
end
to
it
by
ordering
the
attendant
to
take
mme
rambert
to
her
room
and
induce
her
to
rest
and
to
send
at
once
for
perret
then
he
turned
to
professor
swelding
i
am
greatly
distressed
by
this
incident
professor
it
proves
that
the
cure
of
this
poor
creature
is
by
no
means
so
assured
as
i
had
believed
but
there
are
other
cases
which
will
not
shake
your
faith
in
my
judgment
like
this
i
hope
shall
we
go
on
professor
swelding
tried
to
comfort
the
doctor
the
brain
is
a
pathetically
frail
thing
he
said
you
could
not
have
a
more
striking
case
to
prove
it
that
poor
lady
whom
you
believed
to
be
cured
suddenly
having
a
typical
crisis
of
her
form
of
insanity
provoked
by
what
neither
you
nor
i
look
particularly
like
assassins
do
we
and
he
followed
biron
who
was
much
discomfited
to
be
shown
other
matters
of
interest
better
now
madame
are
you
going
to
be
good
mme
rambert
was
reclining
on
a
sofa
in
her
room
watching
her
attendant
berthe
moving
about
and
tidying
up
the
slight
disorder
caused
by
her
recent
ministrations
the
patient
made
a
little
gesture
of
despair
poor
berthe
she
said
if
you
only
knew
how
unhappy
i
am
and
how
sorry
for
having
given
way
to
that
panic
just
now
oh
that
was
nothing
said
the
attendant
the
doctor
wo
attach
any
importance
to
that
yes
he
will
said
the
patient
with
a
weary
smile
i
think
he
will
attach
importance
to
it
and
in
any
case
it
will
delay
my
discharge
from
this
place
not
a
bit
of
it
madame
why
you
know
they
have
written
to
your
home
to
say
you
are
cured
mme
rambert
did
not
reply
for
a
minute
or
two
then
she
said
tell
me
berthe
what
do
you
understand
by
the
word
the
attendant
was
rather
nonplussed
why
it
means
that
you
are
better
that
you
are
quite
well
her
patient
smiled
bitterly
it
is
true
that
my
health
is
better
now
and
that
my
stay
here
has
done
me
good
but
that
is
not
what
i
was
talking
about
what
is
your
opinion
about
my
madness
you
must
think
about
that
the
attendant
remonstrated
you
are
no
more
mad
than
i
am
oh
i
know
the
worst
symptom
of
madness
is
to
declare
you
are
not
mad
mme
rambert
answered
sadly
so
i
will
be
careful
not
to
say
it
berthe
but
apart
from
this
last
panic
the
reason
for
which
i
can
not
tell
you
have
you
ever
known
me
do
or
heard
me
say
anything
that
was
utterly
devoid
of
reason
in
all
the
time
that
i
have
been
in
your
charge
struck
by
the
remark
the
attendant
in
spite
of
herself
was
obliged
to
confess
no
i
never
have
that
is
that
is
mme
rambert
finished
for
her
i
have
sometimes
protested
to
you
that
i
was
the
victim
of
an
abominable
persecution
and
that
there
was
a
tragic
mystery
in
my
life
in
short
that
if
i
was
shut
up
here
it
was
because
someone
wanted
me
to
be
shut
up
come
now
berthe
has
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
perhaps
i
was
telling
the
truth
the
attendant
had
been
shaken
for
a
minute
by
the
calm
of
her
patient
now
she
resumed
her
professional
manner
do
worry
any
more
mme
rambert
for
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
biron
acknowledges
that
you
are
cured
now
you
are
going
to
leave
the
place
and
resume
your
ordinary
life
ah
berthe
said
mme
rambert
twisting
and
untwisting
her
hands
if
you
only
knew
why
if
i
leave
this
sanatorium
or
rather
if
the
doctor
sends
me
back
to
my
family
i
shall
certainly
be
put
in
some
other
sanatorium
before
two
days
are
past
no
it
is
merely
an
idea
that
i
have
got
into
my
head
she
went
on
as
the
attendant
protested
listen
during
the
whole
ten
months
that
i
have
been
here
i
have
never
once
protested
that
i
was
not
insane
i
was
quite
glad
to
be
in
this
place
for
i
felt
safe
here
but
now
i
am
not
sure
of
that
i
must
go
but
i
must
not
go
merely
to
return
to
my
husband
i
must
be
free
free
to
go
to
those
who
will
help
me
to
escape
from
the
horrible
trap
in
which
i
have
spent
the
last
few
years
of
my
life
mme
rambert
earnest
tone
convinced
the
attendant
in
spite
of
her
own
instinct
yes
she
said
enquiringly
i
suppose
you
know
that
i
am
rich
berthe
mme
rambert
went
on
i
have
always
been
generous
to
you
and
higher
fees
are
paid
for
me
here
than
are
paid
for
any
other
patient
would
you
like
to
make
sure
of
your
future
for
ever
and
quite
easily
i
have
heard
you
talk
about
getting
married
shall
i
give
you
a
dot
you
might
lose
your
situation
here
but
if
you
trust
me
i
will
make
it
up
to
you
a
hundredfold
if
you
will
help
me
to
escape
from
this
place
and
it
can
not
be
too
soon
i
have
not
a
minute
to
lose
berthe
tried
to
get
away
from
her
patient
but
mme
rambert
held
her
back
almost
by
force
tell
me
your
price
she
said
how
much
do
you
want
a
thousand
pounds
two
thousand
pounds
and
as
the
attendant
bewildered
by
the
mere
suggestion
of
such
fabulous
sums
was
silent
mme
rambert
slipped
a
diamond
ring
off
her
finger
and
held
it
out
to
the
young
woman
take
that
as
proof
of
my
sincerity
she
said
if
anybody
asks
me
about
it
i
will
say
that
i
have
lost
it
and
from
now
berthe
begin
to
prepare
a
way
for
me
to
escape
the
very
night
that
i
am
free
i
swear
you
shall
be
a
rich
woman
berthe
got
up
swaying
hardly
knowing
if
she
was
awake
or
dreaming
a
rich
woman
she
murmured
a
rich
woman
and
over
the
girl
face
there
suddenly
crept
a
horrible
expression
of
cupidity
and
desire
xvi
among
the
market
porters
boulevard
rochechouart
said
berthe
the
young
asylum
nurse
to
the
conductor
as
she
sprang
into
the
tram
just
as
it
was
starting
it
was
a
september
afternoon
one
of
the
last
fine
days
of
the
now
summer
and
the
girl
had
just
got
her
fortnightly
leave
for
hours
she
had
gone
off
duty
at
noon
and
now
had
until
noon
on
the
next
day
but
one
to
resume
her
own
personality
and
shake
off
the
anxieties
that
beset
all
those
who
are
charged
with
the
constant
care
of
the
insane
the
most
distressing
kind
of
patients
that
exists
as
a
general
rule
berthe
spent
her
fortnightly
holidays
with
her
old
in
their
cottage
outside
paris
but
on
this
occasion
she
had
elected
to
remain
in
the
city
influenced
thereto
by
the
long
conversation
she
had
had
with
the
patient
confided
to
her
particular
care
no
mme
rambert
since
that
first
talk
with
her
on
the
day
of
professor
swelding
visit
to
the
asylum
she
had
had
others
and
berthe
had
now
elaborated
a
plan
to
enable
the
supposed
lunatic
to
escape
and
had
decided
to
spend
her
short
holiday
in
bringing
the
plan
to
a
point
at
the
boulevard
rochechouart
berthe
got
out
of
the
tram
looked
around
to
get
her
bearings
in
the
somewhat
unfamiliar
neighbourhood
and
then
turned
into
the
rue
clignancourt
and
stood
on
the
side
of
the
street
looking
at
the
shops
the
third
one
was
a
wine
shop
only
the
first
of
many
in
the
street
berthe
pushed
the
door
of
this
establishment
a
little
way
open
and
looked
at
the
rather
rowdy
company
gathered
round
the
zinc
counter
all
with
flushed
faces
and
all
talking
loudly
she
did
not
venture
inside
but
in
a
clear
voice
asked
is
geoffroy
here
no
definite
answer
was
forthcoming
but
the
men
turned
round
hearing
her
enquiry
and
seeing
her
pretty
figure
began
to
nudge
one
another
and
jest
and
laugh
coarsely
come
in
missy
said
one
of
them
but
already
berthe
had
quickly
closed
the
door
and
lightly
gone
on
her
way
a
few
yards
further
on
there
was
another
bar
and
into
this
also
berthe
peeped
and
once
more
asked
is
geoffroy
here
adding
by
way
of
further
explanation
hogshead
geoffroy
i
mean
this
time
a
roar
of
laughter
followed
and
the
girl
fled
flushed
with
indignation
yet
she
did
not
desist
from
her
strange
search
and
at
last
at
the
sixth
shop
her
question
was
answered
by
a
deep
bass
voice
from
the
far
end
of
a
den
hogshead
geoffroy
here
and
heaving
a
sigh
of
relief
berthe
went
inside
the
shop
when
you
want
to
see
hogshead
geoffroy
your
procedure
is
simplicity
itself
as
he
has
no
known
address
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
start
at
the
bottom
of
the
rue
clignancourt
on
the
side
look
into
every
wineshop
and
ask
in
tones
loud
enough
to
be
heard
above
the
clatter
of
conversation
whether
hogshead
geoffroy
is
there
and
it
will
be
mighty
bad
luck
if
at
one
or
other
of
the
bars
you
do
not
hear
the
answer
hogshead
geoffroy
here
followed
immediately
by
that
gentleman
order
to
the
half
a
pint
please
the
gentleman
will
pay
it
is
a
safe
order
the
knows
from
past
experience
that
she
can
serve
the
without
anxiety
hogshead
geoffroy
rapidly
drains
it
and
then
holds
out
a
huge
and
hairy
hand
to
the
visitor
and
enquires
well
what
is
it
if
as
often
happens
the
hogshead
finds
himself
confronted
by
a
stranger
he
feels
no
surprise
he
knows
his
own
popularity
and
is
a
modest
soul
so
he
calls
his
visitor
by
his
christian
name
at
once
taps
him
amicably
on
the
shoulder
and
calls
him
old
boy
and
invites
him
to
stand
a
drink
the
hogshead
is
an
artist
in
his
line
he
hires
himself
out
to
public
halls
to
announce
in
his
powerful
voice
reinforced
by
a
trumpet
the
various
items
on
the
programme
or
the
results
of
performances
achieved
he
also
harangues
the
crowd
on
behalf
of
showmen
or
hurls
threats
at
too
excited
demonstrators
at
public
demonstrations
between
whiles
he
rolls
hogsheads
down
into
cellars
or
bottles
wine
and
even
drinks
it
when
he
is
among
friends
who
have
money
to
pay
withal
at
sight
of
berthe
hogshead
geoffroy
so
far
departed
from
custom
as
not
to
give
an
order
to
the
at
the
bar
instead
he
rose
and
went
towards
the
girl
and
unceremoniously
embraced
her
little
sister
there
you
are
why
i
was
just
that
moment
thinking
of
you
he
drew
her
to
the
back
of
the
shop
towards
a
bunch
of
sturdy
fellows
drinking
there
to
whom
he
introduced
her
now
then
mates
try
to
behave
yourselves
i
bringing
a
charming
young
lady
to
see
you
my
sister
berthe
little
bob
bobinette
as
we
called
her
when
we
lived
with
the
old
folks
the
girl
blushed
a
little
uneasy
at
finding
herself
in
such
a
mixed
company
but
hogshead
geoffroy
put
every
one
at
ease
he
put
his
great
hand
under
berthe
chin
and
tilted
her
head
back
do
you
think
she
is
pretty
this
little
sister
of
mine
she
the
very
spit
of
her
brother
there
was
a
general
roar
of
laughter
the
contrast
between
the
two
figures
was
so
great
that
it
seemed
impossible
there
could
be
any
relationship
between
them
the
graceful
slender
tiny
looking
tinier
still
beside
the
huge
colossus
of
a
man
six
feet
high
with
the
chest
of
a
bull
and
the
shoulders
of
an
athlete
we
do
seem
to
be
built
on
quite
the
same
lines
geoffroy
admitted
but
all
the
same
there
is
a
family
likeness
the
men
made
room
for
the
girl
and
after
she
had
yielded
to
the
general
insistence
and
accepted
a
glass
of
white
wine
geoffroy
bent
forward
and
spoke
in
a
lower
tone
well
what
do
you
want
with
me
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
something
which
will
interest
you
sure
berthe
answered
anything
to
be
got
out
of
it
was
the
giant
next
enquiry
berthe
smiled
i
expect
so
or
i
would
have
troubled
you
whenever
there
any
money
to
be
picked
up
the
hogshead
always
on
he
replied
especially
just
now
when
things
are
any
too
bright
though
i
may
tell
you
i
think
there
going
to
be
an
alteration
in
that
respect
have
you
got
a
situation
berthe
asked
in
some
surprise
hogshead
geoffroy
laid
a
finger
on
his
lip
it
still
a
secret
he
said
but
there
no
harm
in
talking
it
over
for
everybody
here
knows
all
about
it
and
at
interminable
length
and
with
many
a
pause
for
libations
he
explained
that
he
was
a
candidate
for
an
appointment
as
market
porter
he
had
been
cramming
for
a
fortnight
past
in
order
to
emerge
triumphantly
from
the
examination
to
which
candidates
were
always
subjected
and
that
very
morning
he
had
sat
in
the
hôtel
de
ville
wrestling
with
nothing
less
than
a
problem
in
arithmetic
in
proof
he
produced
from
his
pocket
a
crumpled
greasy
and
sheet
of
paper
scrawled
all
over
with
childish
writing
and
figures
and
showed
it
to
his
sister
immensely
proud
of
the
effect
he
was
producing
on
her
a
problem
he
repeated
see
here
two
taps
fill
a
tank
at
the
rate
of
twenty
litres
a
minute
and
a
third
tap
empties
it
at
the
rate
of
fifteen
hundred
litres
an
hour
how
long
will
it
take
for
the
tank
to
get
full
a
friend
of
geoffroy
broke
in
it
was
mealy
benoît
his
most
formidable
competitor
for
the
appointment
and
how
long
will
it
take
for
you
to
get
full
he
asked
with
a
great
laugh
hogshead
geoffroy
banged
his
fist
on
the
table
this
is
a
serious
conversation
he
said
and
turned
again
to
his
sister
who
wanted
to
know
if
he
had
succeeded
in
finding
the
answer
to
the
problem
maybe
he
replied
i
worked
by
rule
of
thumb
for
as
you
know
arithmetic
and
all
those
devil
funniments
are
in
my
line
to
sit
for
an
hour
writing
at
a
table
in
the
great
hall
of
the
hôtel
de
ville
not
much
it
made
me
sweat
more
than
carrying
four
hundredweight
but
the
company
was
preparing
to
make
a
move
time
was
getting
on
and
at
six
the
second
part
of
the
examination
the
physical
test
was
to
be
held
in
the
fish
market
mealy
benoît
had
paid
his
score
already
and
hogshead
geoffroy
deferent
escort
of
friends
was
getting
restless
berthe
won
fresh
favour
in
her
brother
eyes
by
paying
for
their
refreshments
with
a
ten
franc
piece
and
leaving
the
change
to
be
placed
to
his
credit
and
then
with
him
she
left
the
wineshop
the
annual
competition
for
an
appointment
as
market
porter
is
held
at
the
end
of
september
it
is
a
great
event
there
are
generally
many
candidates
but
only
two
or
three
and
sometimes
less
of
the
best
are
picked
the
posts
are
few
and
good
for
the
number
of
porters
is
limited
the
examination
is
in
two
parts
one
purely
intellectual
consisting
of
some
simple
problem
and
a
little
dictation
the
other
physical
in
which
the
candidates
have
to
carry
a
sack
of
meal
weighing
three
hundredweight
a
distance
of
two
hundred
yards
in
the
shortest
time
at
six
punctually
the
market
women
were
all
in
their
places
along
the
pavement
by
their
respective
stalls
the
hall
was
decorated
with
flags
the
salesmen
and
regular
shopmen
were
provided
with
chairs
and
their
assistants
were
behind
them
with
the
sweepers
and
criers
at
the
back
stood
three
or
four
rows
of
the
general
public
all
eager
to
witness
the
impressive
display
the
course
was
carefully
cleared
every
obstacle
having
been
scrupulously
swept
off
the
asphalte
especially
pieces
of
lettuce
leaves
and
bits
of
rotten
vegetable
matter
which
might
have
caused
a
competitor
to
slip
when
trying
to
break
the
record
for
carrying
the
sack
a
high
official
of
the
hôtel
de
ville
and
three
of
the
senior
market
porters
formed
the
jury
and
there
were
also
two
officials
of
the
cyclists
union
expert
in
the
use
of
stop
watches
armed
with
tested
chronometers
and
deputed
to
take
the
exact
time
of
each
performance
the
crowd
of
onlookers
was
as
odd
and
eclectic
and
keen
as
can
possibly
be
imagined
berthe
who
knew
that
false
modesty
is
quite
out
of
place
in
popular
gatherings
mingled
freely
in
the
general
conversation
among
other
picturesque
types
she
had
noticed
one
particularly
extraordinary
individual
who
although
he
was
in
the
last
row
of
all
overtopped
the
rest
by
quite
half
of
his
body
being
perched
on
an
antiquated
tricycle
which
provoked
the
hilarity
of
the
mob
what
ho
bouzille
somebody
called
out
for
the
man
was
a
and
popular
figure
and
everybody
knew
his
name
is
that
tricycle
that
you
have
pinched
and
to
some
of
the
sallies
the
fellow
replied
with
a
smile
that
was
almost
lost
in
his
matted
beard
and
to
others
with
a
jest
uttered
in
the
purest
dialect
of
auvergne
someone
spoke
softly
in
berthe
ear
and
she
turned
and
saw
a
sturdy
fellow
of
about
wearing
a
blue
blouse
a
red
handkerchief
round
his
neck
and
a
drover
cap
he
was
a
powerful
man
and
in
spite
of
his
humble
dress
had
an
intelligent
face
and
an
almost
distinguished
manner
berthe
responded
amiably
and
a
few
commonplace
remarks
were
exchanged
between
the
two
in
case
you
care
to
know
my
name
julot
said
the
man
and
berthe
replied
frankly
but
without
otherwise
compromising
herself
and
i
am
bob
or
bobinette
whichever
you
like
i
am
hogshead
geoffroy
sister
she
added
with
a
little
touch
of
pride
a
murmur
ran
round
the
crowd
mealy
benoît
was
going
through
his
trial
the
great
fellow
came
along
with
rapid
rhythmical
step
with
supple
limbs
and
chest
hunched
forward
surely
balanced
on
his
broad
shoulders
and
the
nape
of
his
neck
was
an
enormous
sack
of
meal
accurately
weighed
to
scale
three
hundredweight
without
the
least
hesitation
or
slackening
of
pace
he
covered
the
two
hundred
yards
reaching
the
goal
perfectly
fresh
and
fit
he
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
in
front
of
the
judges
displaying
the
mighty
muscles
of
his
naked
chest
over
which
the
perspiration
was
running
and
evincing
genuine
delight
in
not
freeing
himself
from
his
heavy
burden
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
the
applause
was
enthusiastic
and
immediate
but
silence
quickly
fell
again
and
all
eyes
turned
towards
the
it
was
hogshead
geoffroy
turn
the
giant
was
really
a
splendid
sight
instead
of
walking
as
his
rival
had
done
he
began
to
step
like
a
gymnast
and
the
crowd
yelled
their
delight
it
seemed
that
he
must
beat
his
rival
time
easily
but
all
at
once
the
great
sack
on
his
shoulders
was
seen
to
shake
and
geoffroy
almost
stopped
uttering
a
heavy
groan
before
he
got
going
again
the
crowd
looked
on
in
surprise
where
he
had
just
set
his
feet
there
was
a
wet
mark
upon
the
asphalte
geoffroy
had
slipped
on
a
piece
of
but
he
managed
to
restore
the
equilibrium
of
the
sack
and
taught
caution
by
the
risk
he
had
just
run
he
finished
the
course
with
measured
steps
two
hours
later
the
result
of
the
competition
was
announced
hogshead
geoffroy
and
mealy
benoît
were
bracketed
equal
having
taken
exactly
the
same
time
to
cover
the
course
upon
the
result
of
the
written
examination
would
depend
the
final
issue
and
the
matter
was
all
the
more
important
because
this
year
there
was
but
one
vacancy
for
a
market
porter
berthe
or
bobinette
was
vehemently
discussing
with
her
neighbours
the
mishap
that
had
befallen
geoffroy
during
his
trial
a
man
dressed
in
a
shabby
black
overcoat
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
and
wearing
a
kind
of
jockey
cap
on
his
greasy
hair
was
watching
her
intently
seeming
to
agree
with
all
she
said
while
really
interested
in
something
else
berthe
who
was
very
intent
upon
the
matter
in
hand
did
not
notice
this
individual
manner
it
was
julot
her
faithful
squire
for
the
last
two
hours
who
got
her
away
come
he
said
taking
her
by
the
sleeve
you
know
your
brother
is
waiting
for
you
and
as
she
yielded
to
his
insistence
he
whispered
in
her
ear
that
chap
a
rascal
i
do
think
much
of
him
he
certainly
is
uncommonly
ugly
the
girl
admitted
and
then
like
the
trained
nurse
that
she
was
she
added
and
did
you
notice
his
complexion
the
man
must
be
ill
he
is
absolutely
green
xvii
at
the
pig
pay
for
a
drink
and
i
listen
to
you
said
hogshead
geoffroy
to
his
sister
after
numerous
visits
to
the
many
bars
and
drinking
saloons
that
surround
the
markets
they
had
finally
gone
for
a
late
supper
into
the
pig
the
most
popular
tavern
in
the
neighbourhood
geoffroy
having
reconciled
himself
to
waiting
for
the
result
of
the
examination
which
would
not
be
announced
until
the
following
day
a
new
and
original
attraction
had
been
stationed
outside
the
pig
for
the
last
few
days
after
the
formal
enquiries
succeeding
his
discovery
of
the
drowned
body
in
the
river
bouzille
had
come
to
paris
to
see
the
eiffel
tower
he
had
met
with
but
a
delay
in
his
itinerary
having
been
locked
up
for
that
time
at
orleans
for
some
trifling
misdemeanour
on
entering
the
capital
bouzille
extraordinary
equipage
had
caused
quite
a
sensation
and
as
the
worthy
fellow
with
utter
disregard
of
the
heavy
traffic
in
the
city
had
careered
about
in
it
through
the
most
crowded
streets
he
had
very
soon
been
run
in
and
taken
to
the
nearest
his
train
had
been
confiscated
for
hours
but
as
there
was
nothing
really
to
be
objected
against
the
tramp
he
had
merely
been
requested
to
make
himself
scarce
and
not
to
do
it
again
bouzille
did
not
quite
know
what
to
make
of
it
all
but
while
he
was
towing
his
two
carriages
behind
his
tricycle
towards
the
from
which
point
he
would
at
last
be
able
to
contemplate
the
eiffel
tower
he
had
fallen
in
with
the
editor
of
the
to
whom
in
exchange
for
a
bottle
of
wine
at
the
next
café
he
had
ingenuously
confided
his
story
a
sensational
article
about
the
tramp
appeared
in
the
next
number
of
that
famous
sporting
journal
and
bouzille
woke
to
find
himself
famous
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
that
françois
bonbonne
the
proprietor
of
the
pig
shrewdly
foreseeing
that
this
original
character
with
his
remarkable
equipage
would
furnish
a
singular
attraction
engaged
him
to
station
himself
outside
the
establishment
from
eleven
to
three
every
night
in
return
for
his
board
and
lodging
and
a
salary
of
five
francs
a
day
it
need
not
be
said
that
bouzille
had
closed
with
the
offer
but
getting
tired
of
cooling
his
heels
on
the
doorstep
he
had
gradually
taken
to
leaving
his
train
on
the
pavement
and
himself
going
down
into
the
basement
hall
where
he
generously
returned
his
five
francs
every
night
to
the
proprietor
in
exchange
for
potations
to
that
amount
in
the
basement
of
the
pig
the
atmosphere
was
steadily
getting
cloudier
and
the
noise
louder
the
time
was
about
a
quarter
to
two
the
swells
and
the
young
men
about
town
who
went
to
have
a
bowl
of
onion
soup
at
the
popular
café
because
that
was
the
latest
correct
thing
to
do
had
withdrawn
the
few
pale
and
shabby
dancers
had
given
their
show
and
in
another
ten
minutes
when
the
wealthy
customers
had
departed
the
supper
room
would
resume
its
natural
appearance
and
everybody
would
be
at
home
françois
bonbonne
had
just
escorted
the
last
toffs
up
the
narrow
corkscrew
staircase
that
led
from
the
basement
to
the
and
now
he
stood
his
stout
person
entirely
filling
the
only
exit
unctuously
suggesting
that
perhaps
somebody
would
like
to
give
an
order
for
a
hot
wine
salad
berthe
was
sitting
in
a
corner
beside
her
brother
whom
the
warmth
of
the
room
and
his
numerous
potations
had
rendered
drowsy
and
thinking
it
an
opportune
moment
to
tell
him
of
her
scheme
before
he
became
talkative
or
quarrelsome
she
began
to
explain
there
nothing
much
to
do
but
i
want
a
strong
man
like
you
any
barrels
to
roll
anywhere
he
enquired
in
a
thick
voice
berthe
shook
her
head
her
glance
meanwhile
resting
mechanically
on
a
small
young
man
with
a
budding
beard
and
a
pale
face
who
had
just
taken
a
seat
opposite
her
and
was
timidly
ordering
a
portion
of
sauerkraut
i
want
some
bars
removed
from
a
window
they
are
iron
bars
set
in
stone
but
the
stone
is
worn
and
the
bars
are
very
rusty
and
anybody
with
a
little
strength
could
wrench
them
out
and
that
all
geoffroy
enquired
suspiciously
yes
that
all
then
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
help
you
i
suppose
it
will
be
worth
something
wo
it
he
broke
off
short
noticing
that
a
man
sitting
close
by
seemed
to
be
listening
attentively
to
the
conversation
berthe
followed
his
eyes
and
then
turned
with
a
smile
to
her
brother
that
all
right
do
mind
i
know
that
man
and
in
proof
of
the
statement
she
held
out
a
friendly
hand
to
the
individual
who
seemed
to
be
spying
upon
them
good
evening
again
julot
how
are
you
since
i
saw
you
just
now
i
did
not
notice
you
were
here
julot
shook
hands
with
her
and
without
evincing
any
further
interest
in
her
went
on
with
the
conversation
he
was
having
with
his
own
companion
a
fellow
go
on
billy
tom
he
said
in
low
tones
tell
me
what
has
happened
well
there
has
been
the
devil
to
pay
at
the
royal
palace
owing
to
that
accident
you
know
of
course
i
was
not
mixed
up
in
it
in
any
way
i
only
interpreter
and
i
stick
to
my
own
job
but
three
weeks
after
the
affair
muller
was
suddenly
kicked
out
owing
to
the
door
having
been
opened
for
the
chap
who
worked
the
robbery
muller
muller
said
julot
seeming
to
be
searching
his
memory
who
is
muller
why
the
watchman
on
the
second
floor
oh
ah
yes
and
who
turned
him
out
i
think
his
name
is
juve
oh
ho
julot
muttered
to
himself
i
thought
as
much
there
was
a
noise
at
the
entrance
of
the
hall
and
down
the
corkscrew
staircase
came
two
people
who
judging
by
the
greeting
they
received
were
very
popular
ernestine
a
figure
and
mealy
benoît
who
was
very
drunk
benoît
lurched
from
one
table
to
another
leaning
on
every
head
and
pair
of
shoulders
that
came
his
way
and
reached
an
empty
seat
on
a
lounge
into
which
he
crushed
half
squashing
the
pale
young
man
with
the
budding
beard
the
lad
made
no
protest
seeming
to
be
afraid
of
his
neighbour
bulk
but
merely
wriggled
sideways
and
tried
to
give
the
all
the
room
he
wanted
benoît
did
not
seem
even
to
notice
the
humble
little
fellow
but
ernestine
took
pity
on
him
and
assured
him
that
she
would
look
after
him
all
right
sonny
she
said
mealy
wo
squash
you
and
if
he
tries
any
of
his
games
on
you
ernestine
will
look
after
you
she
took
his
head
between
her
two
hands
and
kissed
his
forehead
affectionately
ignoring
mealy
benoît
angry
protests
he
a
dear
little
chap
i
like
him
she
said
to
the
company
at
large
what
your
name
deary
the
boy
blushed
to
the
tips
of
his
ears
paul
he
murmured
but
françois
bonbonne
the
proprietor
with
his
usual
keen
eye
to
business
arrived
just
then
and
set
down
before
mealy
benoît
the
famous
hot
wine
salad
of
which
he
had
spoken
before
behind
bonbonne
came
bouzille
who
had
left
his
on
the
pavement
and
come
down
into
the
supper
room
to
eat
and
drink
his
five
francs
and
more
if
credit
could
be
got
benoît
caught
sight
of
hogshead
geoffroy
and
immediately
offered
to
clink
glasses
with
him
he
pushed
a
glass
towards
him
inviting
him
to
dip
it
with
the
rest
into
the
steaming
bowl
but
geoffroy
was
warming
up
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
and
broke
into
a
sudden
flame
of
wrath
at
sight
of
mealy
benoît
if
benoît
should
be
given
the
first
place
it
would
be
a
rank
injustice
he
reflected
for
he
geoffroy
was
most
certainly
the
stronger
man
and
besides
the
sturdy
hogshead
was
beginning
to
wonder
whether
his
rival
might
not
have
devised
an
odious
plot
against
him
and
put
the
famous
piece
of
upon
the
track
but
for
which
geoffroy
would
have
won
hands
down
so
geoffroy
very
drunk
offered
benoît
who
was
no
whit
more
sober
the
gross
affront
of
refusing
to
clink
glasses
with
him
why
it
you
exclaimed
bouzille
in
ringing
tones
of
such
glad
surprise
that
everybody
turned
round
to
see
whom
he
was
addressing
julot
and
berthe
looked
with
the
rest
why
it
the
green
man
of
just
now
said
the
asylum
nurse
to
her
companion
and
he
assented
moodily
enough
yes
it
him
right
enough
bouzille
took
no
notice
of
the
attention
he
had
provoked
and
did
not
seem
to
notice
that
the
green
man
appeared
to
be
anything
but
pleased
at
having
been
recognised
i
seen
you
before
i
know
he
went
on
where
have
i
met
you
the
green
man
did
not
answer
he
affected
to
be
engrossed
in
a
most
serious
conversation
with
the
friend
he
had
brought
with
him
into
the
supper
room
a
shabby
individual
who
carried
a
guitar
but
bouzille
was
not
to
be
put
off
and
suddenly
he
exclaimed
with
perfect
indifference
to
what
his
neighbours
might
think
i
know
you
are
the
tramp
who
was
arrested
with
me
down
there
in
lot
the
day
of
that
murder
you
know
the
murder
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
bouzille
in
his
excitement
had
caught
the
green
man
by
the
sleeve
but
the
green
man
impatiently
shook
him
off
growling
angrily
well
and
what
about
it
for
some
minutes
now
hogshead
geoffroy
and
mealy
benoît
had
been
exchanging
threatening
glances
geoffroy
had
given
voice
to
his
suspicions
and
kind
friends
had
not
failed
to
report
his
words
to
benoît
inflamed
with
drink
as
they
were
the
two
men
were
bound
to
come
to
blows
before
long
and
a
dull
murmur
ran
through
the
room
heralding
the
approaching
altercation
berthe
anxious
on
her
brother
behalf
and
a
little
frightened
on
her
own
did
all
she
could
to
induce
geoffroy
to
come
away
but
even
though
she
promised
to
pay
for
any
number
of
drinks
elsewhere
he
refused
to
budge
from
the
bench
where
he
was
sitting
hunched
up
in
a
corner
when
at
length
he
got
rid
of
bouzille
and
his
exasperating
garrulity
the
green
man
resumed
his
conversation
with
his
friend
with
the
guitar
it
rather
odd
that
he
has
a
trace
of
accent
the
latter
remarked
oh
it
nothing
for
a
fellow
like
gurn
to
speak
french
like
a
frenchman
said
the
green
man
in
a
low
tone
then
he
stopped
nervously
ernestine
was
walking
about
among
the
company
chatting
to
one
and
another
and
getting
drinks
and
he
fancied
that
she
was
listening
to
what
he
said
but
another
duologue
rose
audible
in
another
part
of
the
room
if
the
gentleman
would
like
to
show
his
strength
there
someone
ready
to
take
him
on
hogshead
geoffroy
had
thrown
down
his
glove
silence
fell
upon
the
room
it
was
mealy
benoît
turn
to
answer
at
that
precise
moment
however
benoît
was
draining
the
salad
bowl
he
slowly
swallowed
the
last
of
the
red
liquid
one
ca
do
two
things
at
once
laid
the
bowl
down
empty
on
the
table
and
in
thundering
dignified
tones
demanded
another
wiped
his
lips
on
the
back
of
his
sleeve
and
turned
his
huge
head
towards
the
corner
where
geoffroy
was
hunched
up
saying
will
the
gentleman
kindly
repeat
his
last
remark
ernestine
moved
furtively
to
julot
side
and
affecting
to
be
interested
only
in
the
argument
going
on
between
geoffroy
and
benoît
said
without
looking
at
him
the
pale
man
with
the
greenish
complexion
said
to
the
man
with
the
guitar
he
all
right
because
of
the
burn
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
julot
choked
back
an
oath
and
instinctively
clenched
his
fist
but
ernestine
already
had
moved
on
and
was
huskily
chaffing
the
young
man
with
the
budding
beard
julot
sat
with
sombre
face
and
angry
eyes
only
replying
in
curt
monosyllables
to
the
occasional
remarks
of
his
next
neighbour
billy
tom
marie
the
waitress
was
passing
near
him
and
he
signed
to
her
to
stop
say
marie
he
said
nodding
towards
the
window
that
was
behind
him
what
does
that
window
open
on
to
the
girl
thought
for
a
moment
on
to
the
cellar
she
said
this
hall
is
in
the
basement
and
the
cellar
julot
went
on
how
do
you
get
out
of
that
you
ca
the
servant
answered
there
no
door
you
have
to
come
through
here
momentarily
becoming
more
uneasy
julot
scrutinised
the
long
tunnel
of
a
room
at
the
extreme
end
of
which
he
was
sitting
there
was
only
one
means
of
egress
up
the
narrow
corkscrew
staircase
leading
to
the
and
at
the
very
foot
of
that
staircase
was
the
table
occupied
by
the
green
man
and
the
man
with
the
guitar
a
plate
aimed
by
hogshead
geoffroy
at
mealy
benoît
crashed
against
the
opposite
wall
everyone
jumped
to
his
feet
the
women
screaming
the
men
swearing
the
two
market
porters
stood
confronting
one
another
hogshead
geoffroy
brandishing
a
chair
benoît
trying
to
wrench
the
marble
top
from
a
table
to
serve
as
a
weapon
the
mêlée
became
general
plates
smashing
on
the
floor
and
dinner
things
flying
towards
the
ceiling
suddenly
a
shot
rang
out
but
quickly
though
it
had
been
fired
the
green
man
and
the
man
with
the
guitar
had
seen
who
fired
it
for
the
last
few
minutes
indeed
these
two
mysterious
individuals
had
never
taken
their
eyes
off
julot
julot
whom
berthe
had
supposed
from
his
appearance
to
be
an
honest
was
undoubtedly
a
wonderful
shot
having
observed
that
the
room
was
lighted
by
a
single
chandelier
composed
of
three
electric
lamps
and
that
the
current
was
supplied
by
only
two
wires
running
along
the
cornice
julot
had
taken
aim
at
the
wires
and
cut
them
clean
in
two
with
a
single
shot
immediately
following
upon
the
shot
the
room
was
plunged
into
absolute
darkness
a
perfectly
incredible
uproar
ensued
men
and
women
struggling
together
and
shouting
and
trampling
one
another
down
and
crockery
and
dinner
things
crashing
down
from
the
and
tables
on
to
the
floor
above
the
din
a
sudden
hoarse
cry
of
pain
rang
out
help
and
simultaneously
berthe
who
was
lost
among
the
mob
heard
a
muttered
exclamation
in
her
ear
and
felt
two
hands
groping
all
over
her
body
as
if
trying
to
identify
her
the
young
nurse
was
the
only
woman
in
the
room
wearing
a
hat
half
swooning
with
terror
she
felt
herself
picked
up
and
thrust
upon
a
bench
and
then
someone
whispered
in
a
vinous
voice
you
are
not
to
help
no
the
rambert
woman
to
escape
berthe
was
so
utterly
astonished
that
she
overcame
her
fright
sufficiently
to
stammer
out
a
question
but
what
but
who
lower
still
but
yet
more
peremptorily
the
voice
became
audible
again
fantômas
forbids
you
to
do
it
and
if
you
disobey
you
die
the
nurse
dropped
back
upon
the
bench
half
fainting
with
fright
and
the
row
in
the
supper
room
grew
worse
three
men
were
fighting
now
the
green
man
being
at
grips
with
two
at
once
the
green
man
did
not
seem
to
feel
the
blows
rained
on
him
but
with
a
strength
that
was
far
beyond
the
ordinary
he
gripped
hold
of
an
arm
and
slid
his
hands
along
the
sleeve
never
letting
go
of
the
arm
until
he
reached
the
wrist
when
wrenching
open
the
clenched
fist
he
slipped
his
fingers
on
to
the
palm
of
the
hand
a
little
exclamation
of
triumph
escaped
him
and
simultaneously
the
owner
of
the
hand
uttered
an
exclamation
of
pain
for
the
green
man
fingers
had
touched
a
still
raw
wound
upon
the
hollow
of
the
palm
but
at
that
instant
his
leg
was
caught
between
two
powerful
knees
and
the
slightest
pressure
more
would
have
broken
it
the
green
man
was
forced
to
let
go
the
hand
he
held
he
fell
to
the
ground
with
his
adversary
upon
him
and
for
a
moment
thought
that
he
was
lost
but
at
the
same
moment
his
adversary
let
go
of
him
in
turn
having
been
taken
by
surprise
by
yet
a
third
combatant
who
joined
in
the
fray
and
separated
the
first
two
devoting
himself
to
a
furious
assault
upon
the
man
whom
the
green
man
had
tried
to
capture
the
green
man
passed
a
rapid
hand
over
the
individual
who
had
just
rescued
him
from
the
fierce
assault
and
was
conscious
of
a
shock
of
surprise
as
he
identified
the
young
man
with
the
budding
beard
thereupon
he
collared
him
firmly
by
the
neck
and
did
not
let
him
go
in
the
crush
the
combatants
had
been
forced
towards
the
staircase
and
at
this
narrow
entrance
into
the
hall
bodies
were
being
trampled
underfoot
and
piercing
screams
rent
the
air
françois
bonbonne
had
not
made
the
least
attempt
to
interfere
he
knew
exactly
the
proper
procedure
when
trouble
of
this
sort
broke
out
and
he
had
gone
to
the
corner
of
the
street
and
sent
the
constable
on
duty
there
to
the
nearest
police
station
for
help
directly
the
first
gendarmes
arrived
françois
bonbonne
led
them
behind
the
counter
in
the
shop
and
showed
them
the
fire
hose
with
the
skill
acquired
by
long
practice
they
rapidly
unrolled
the
pipe
introduced
it
into
the
narrow
mouth
of
the
staircase
turned
on
the
tap
and
proceeded
to
drench
everybody
in
the
supper
room
below
the
unexpected
sousing
pulled
the
combatants
up
short
separated
all
the
champions
and
drove
the
howling
and
shrieking
mob
back
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
the
operation
lasted
for
a
good
five
minutes
and
when
the
gendarmes
considered
that
the
customers
of
the
pig
were
sufficiently
quieted
down
the
sergeant
threw
the
light
of
a
lantern
which
the
proprietor
obligingly
had
ready
for
him
over
the
supper
room
and
peremptorily
ordered
the
company
to
come
up
one
by
one
seeing
that
resistance
would
be
futile
the
company
obeyed
as
they
slowly
emerged
at
the
top
of
the
corkscrew
staircase
meek
and
subdued
the
gendarmes
at
the
top
arrested
them
slipped
handcuffs
on
them
and
sent
them
off
in
couples
to
the
station
when
the
sergeant
assumed
that
every
one
had
come
out
he
went
down
into
the
supper
room
just
to
make
sure
that
nobody
was
still
hiding
there
but
the
room
was
not
quite
empty
one
unfortunate
man
was
lying
on
the
floor
bathed
in
his
own
blood
it
was
the
man
with
the
guitar
and
a
knife
had
been
driven
through
his
breast
the
couple
consisting
of
the
green
man
and
the
young
man
with
the
budding
beard
of
whom
his
companion
had
never
once
let
go
since
identifying
him
during
the
fight
in
the
supper
room
were
taken
to
the
station
the
clerk
who
was
taking
down
the
names
of
the
prisoners
with
difficulty
repressed
an
exclamation
of
surprise
when
the
green
man
produced
an
identification
card
and
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
ear
release
that
gentleman
at
once
said
the
clerk
with
regard
to
the
other
with
regard
to
the
other
the
green
man
broke
in
kindly
release
him
too
i
want
to
keep
him
with
me
the
clerk
bowed
in
consent
and
both
men
were
immediately
released
from
their
handcuffs
the
young
man
stared
in
astonishment
at
the
individual
who
a
minute
before
had
been
his
companion
in
bonds
and
was
about
to
thank
him
but
the
other
grasped
him
firmly
by
the
wrist
as
though
to
warn
him
of
the
impossibility
of
flight
and
led
him
out
of
the
police
station
in
the
street
they
met
the
sergeant
with
a
gendarme
bringing
in
the
unfortunate
man
with
the
guitar
who
was
just
breathing
and
in
whom
the
officials
had
recognised
a
without
letting
go
of
the
youth
the
green
man
bent
forward
to
the
sergeant
and
had
a
brief
but
animated
conversation
with
him
yes
sir
that
all
the
sergeant
said
respectfully
i
anyone
else
the
green
man
stamped
his
foot
in
wrath
good
lord
gurn
has
got
away
towards
the
rue
montmartre
the
green
man
rapidly
dragged
his
companion
who
was
trembling
in
every
limb
and
utterly
at
a
loss
to
guess
what
the
future
held
in
store
for
him
suddenly
the
green
man
halted
just
under
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
outside
the
church
of
he
stood
squarely
in
front
of
his
prisoner
and
looked
him
full
in
the
eyes
i
am
juve
he
said
the
detective
and
as
the
young
man
stared
at
him
in
silent
dismay
juve
went
on
emphasising
each
of
his
words
and
with
a
sardonic
smile
flickering
over
his
face
and
you
mademoiselle
jeanne
you
are
charles
rambert
xviii
a
prisoner
and
a
witness
juve
had
spoken
in
a
tone
of
command
that
brooked
no
reply
his
keen
eyes
seemed
to
pierce
through
paul
and
read
his
inmost
soul
the
winking
light
of
the
street
lamp
shed
a
wan
halo
round
the
lad
who
obviously
wanted
to
move
away
from
its
radius
but
juve
held
him
fast
come
now
answer
you
are
charles
rambert
and
you
were
mademoiselle
jeanne
i
do
understand
paul
declared
really
sneered
juve
he
hailed
a
passing
cab
get
in
he
ordered
briefly
and
pushing
the
lad
in
before
him
he
gave
an
address
to
the
driver
entered
the
cab
and
shut
the
door
juve
sat
there
rubbing
his
hands
as
if
well
pleased
with
his
night
work
for
several
minutes
he
remained
silent
and
then
turned
to
his
companion
you
think
it
is
clever
to
deny
it
he
remarked
but
do
you
imagine
it
is
obvious
to
anyone
that
you
are
charles
rambert
and
that
you
were
disguised
as
mademoiselle
jeanne
but
you
are
wrong
paul
insisted
charles
rambert
is
dead
so
you
know
that
do
you
then
you
admit
that
you
know
whom
i
am
talking
about
the
lad
coloured
and
began
to
tremble
juve
looked
out
of
the
window
pretending
not
to
notice
him
and
smiled
gently
then
he
went
on
in
a
friendly
tone
but
you
know
it
stupid
to
deny
what
ca
be
denied
besides
you
should
remember
that
if
i
know
you
are
charles
rambert
i
must
know
something
else
as
well
and
therefore
well
yes
paul
acknowledged
i
charles
rambert
and
i
was
disguised
as
mademoiselle
jeanne
how
did
you
know
it
why
were
you
at
the
pig
had
you
come
to
arrest
me
and
where
are
you
taking
me
now
to
prison
juve
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
want
to
know
too
much
my
boy
besides
you
ought
to
know
paris
and
so
ought
to
be
able
to
guess
where
i
told
the
driver
to
go
merely
by
looking
at
the
streets
we
are
passing
through
that
is
exactly
what
frightens
me
charles
rambert
replied
we
are
on
the
quays
near
the
law
courts
and
the
police
station
my
son
quite
so
now
it
quite
useless
to
make
a
scene
you
will
gain
nothing
by
attempting
to
get
away
you
are
in
the
hands
of
justice
or
rather
in
my
hands
which
is
not
quite
the
same
thing
so
come
quietly
that
is
really
good
advice
a
few
minutes
later
the
cab
stopped
at
the
tour
pointue
which
has
such
melancholy
associations
for
so
many
criminals
juve
alighted
and
made
his
companion
alight
as
well
paid
the
driver
and
walked
up
the
staircase
to
the
first
floor
of
the
building
it
was
daylight
now
and
the
men
were
coming
on
duty
all
of
them
saluted
juve
as
he
walked
along
with
his
trembling
captive
the
detective
went
down
one
long
passage
turned
into
another
and
opened
a
door
go
in
there
he
ordered
curtly
charles
rambert
obeyed
and
found
himself
in
a
small
room
the
nature
of
which
he
recognised
immediately
from
the
furniture
it
contained
it
was
the
measuring
room
of
the
anthropometric
service
so
what
he
feared
was
about
to
happen
juve
was
going
to
lock
him
up
but
the
detective
called
out
in
a
loud
tone
hector
please
and
one
of
the
men
who
remained
on
duty
in
the
department
in
case
they
were
required
by
any
of
the
detective
inspectors
to
find
the
records
of
any
previously
convicted
criminal
came
hurrying
in
ah
juve
and
with
a
bag
too
so
early
you
think
he
has
been
here
before
no
said
juve
in
a
dry
tone
that
put
a
stop
to
further
indiscreet
questions
i
do
want
you
to
look
up
my
companion
record
but
to
take
his
measurements
and
very
carefully
too
the
man
was
somewhat
surprised
at
the
order
for
it
was
not
usual
to
be
asked
to
do
such
work
at
so
very
early
an
hour
he
was
rather
irritable
too
at
being
disturbed
from
the
rest
he
was
enjoying
and
it
was
very
curtly
that
he
spoke
to
charles
rambert
come
here
please
the
standard
first
take
off
your
boots
charles
rambert
obeyed
and
stood
under
the
standard
of
measurement
and
then
as
the
assistant
ordered
him
he
submitted
to
having
his
fingers
smeared
with
ink
so
that
his
finger
prints
might
be
taken
to
being
photographed
full
face
and
in
profile
and
finally
to
having
the
width
of
his
head
from
ear
to
ear
measured
with
a
special
pair
of
caliper
compasses
hector
was
surprised
by
his
docility
i
must
say
your
friend
is
not
very
talkative
juve
what
has
he
been
up
to
and
as
the
detective
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
did
not
reply
he
went
on
that
done
sir
we
will
develop
the
negatives
and
take
the
prints
and
recopy
the
measurements
and
the
record
shall
be
classified
in
the
register
in
a
couple
of
hours
charles
rambert
grew
momentarily
more
scared
he
felt
that
he
was
definitely
arrested
now
but
juve
left
the
in
which
he
had
been
resting
and
coming
up
to
him
laid
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
speaking
the
while
with
a
certain
gentleness
come
there
are
some
other
points
as
to
which
i
wish
to
examine
you
he
led
him
from
the
anthropometric
room
along
a
dark
corridor
and
presently
taking
a
key
from
his
pocket
opened
a
door
and
pushed
the
lad
in
before
him
go
in
there
he
said
this
is
where
we
make
the
dynamometer
tests
a
layman
looking
round
the
room
might
almost
have
supposed
that
it
was
merely
some
carpenter
shop
pieces
of
wood
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
and
sorts
were
arranged
along
the
wall
or
laid
upon
the
floor
in
glass
cases
were
whole
heaps
of
strips
of
metal
five
or
six
inches
long
and
of
varying
thickness
juve
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
him
for
pity
sake
juve
tell
me
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
me
charles
rambert
implored
the
detective
smiled
well
there
you
ask
a
question
which
i
ca
answer
what
am
i
going
to
do
with
you
eh
that
still
depends
upon
a
good
many
things
as
he
spoke
juve
tossed
his
hat
aside
and
looking
at
a
rather
high
kind
of
little
table
proceeded
to
remove
from
it
a
grey
cloth
which
protected
it
from
dust
and
drew
it
into
the
middle
of
the
room
this
article
was
composed
of
a
metal
body
screwed
on
to
a
strong
tripod
with
a
lower
tray
that
moved
backwards
and
forwards
and
two
lateral
buttresses
with
a
steel
firmly
bolted
on
to
them
above
upon
this
framework
were
two
dynamometers
worked
by
an
ingenious
piece
of
mechanism
juve
looked
at
charles
rambert
and
explained
this
is
bertillon
effraction
dynamometer
i
am
going
to
make
use
of
it
to
find
out
at
once
whether
you
are
or
are
not
deserving
of
some
little
interest
i
do
want
to
tell
you
more
just
at
present
juve
slipped
into
a
specially
prepared
notch
a
thin
strip
of
wood
which
he
had
selected
with
particular
care
from
one
of
the
heaps
of
material
arranged
along
the
wall
from
a
chest
he
took
a
tool
which
charles
rambert
who
had
had
some
intimate
experience
of
late
with
the
community
immediately
recognised
as
a
jemmy
take
hold
of
that
said
juve
and
as
charles
took
it
in
his
hand
he
added
now
put
the
jemmy
into
this
groove
and
press
with
all
your
force
if
you
can
move
that
needle
to
a
point
which
i
know
and
which
it
is
difficult
but
not
impossible
to
reach
you
may
congratulate
yourself
on
being
in
luck
stimulated
by
this
encouragement
from
the
detective
charles
rambert
exerted
all
his
force
upon
the
lever
only
afraid
that
he
might
not
be
strong
enough
juve
stopped
him
very
soon
that
all
right
he
said
and
substituting
a
strip
of
for
the
strip
of
wood
he
handed
another
tool
to
the
lad
now
try
again
a
few
seconds
later
juve
took
a
magnifying
lens
and
closely
examined
both
the
strip
of
metal
and
the
strip
of
wood
he
gave
a
little
satisfied
click
with
his
tongue
and
seemed
to
be
very
pleased
charles
rambert
he
remarked
i
think
we
are
going
to
do
a
very
good
morning
work
bertillon
new
apparatus
is
an
uncommonly
useful
invention
the
detective
might
have
gone
on
with
his
congratulatory
monologue
had
not
an
attendant
come
into
the
room
at
that
moment
ah
there
you
are
juve
i
have
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
there
is
someone
asking
for
you
who
says
he
knows
you
will
receive
him
i
told
him
this
was
not
the
proper
time
but
he
was
so
insistent
that
i
promised
to
bring
you
his
card
besides
he
says
you
have
given
him
an
appointment
juve
took
the
card
and
glanced
at
it
that
all
right
he
said
take
the
gentleman
into
the
parlour
and
tell
him
i
will
be
with
him
in
a
minute
the
attendant
went
out
and
juve
looked
at
charles
rambert
with
a
smile
you
are
played
out
he
said
before
we
do
anything
else
common
humanity
requires
that
you
should
get
some
rest
come
follow
me
i
will
take
you
to
a
room
where
you
can
throw
yourself
on
a
sofa
and
get
a
sleep
for
a
good
hour
at
least
while
i
go
and
see
this
visitor
he
led
the
lad
into
a
small
and
as
charles
rambert
obediently
stretched
himself
upon
the
sofa
juve
looked
at
the
pale
and
nervous
and
completely
silent
boy
and
said
with
even
greater
gentleness
there
go
to
sleep
sleep
quietly
and
presently
juve
left
the
room
and
called
a
man
to
whom
he
gave
an
order
in
a
low
tone
stay
with
that
gentleman
please
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
but
a
friend
you
understand
who
must
not
leave
this
place
i
am
going
to
see
some
one
but
i
will
come
up
again
presently
and
juve
hurried
downstairs
to
the
parlour
the
visitor
rose
as
the
door
opened
and
juve
made
a
formal
bow
gervais
aventin
he
said
gervais
aventin
that
gentleman
replied
and
you
are
juve
i
am
sir
the
detective
answered
and
pointing
his
visitor
to
a
chair
he
took
a
seat
himself
at
a
small
table
littered
with
official
documents
sir
juve
began
i
ventured
to
send
you
that
pressing
invitation
to
come
to
paris
because
from
enquiries
i
had
made
about
you
i
was
sure
that
you
were
a
man
with
a
sense
of
duty
who
would
not
resent
being
put
to
inconvenience
when
it
was
a
question
of
in
a
work
of
justice
and
of
truth
the
visitor
a
man
of
perhaps
thirty
of
somewhat
fashionable
appearance
and
careful
though
quiet
dress
manifested
much
surprise
enquiries
about
me
sir
and
pray
why
i
must
confess
that
i
was
very
much
astonished
when
i
received
your
letter
informing
me
that
the
famous
juve
wished
to
see
me
and
at
first
i
suspected
some
practical
joke
on
consideration
i
decided
to
obey
your
summons
without
further
pressing
but
i
did
not
imagine
that
you
would
have
made
any
enquiries
about
me
how
do
you
know
me
may
i
ask
juve
smiled
is
it
the
fact
he
enquired
instead
of
replying
directly
for
like
the
good
detective
that
he
was
intensely
keen
on
his
work
he
enjoyed
mystifying
people
with
whom
he
conversed
is
it
the
fact
that
your
name
is
gervais
aventin
a
civil
engineer
the
possessor
of
considerable
private
means
about
to
be
married
and
that
lately
you
made
a
short
journey
to
limoges
the
young
man
nodded
and
smiled
your
information
is
perfectly
correct
in
every
particular
but
i
do
not
yet
understand
what
crime
of
mine
can
have
subjected
me
to
these
enquiries
on
your
part
juve
smiled
again
i
wondered
sir
why
you
vouchsafed
no
answer
to
the
local
enquiries
which
have
been
made
at
my
instance
to
the
advertisements
which
i
have
had
inserted
in
the
papers
in
which
i
discreetly
made
it
known
that
the
police
wanted
to
get
into
communication
with
all
the
passengers
who
travelled
first
class
in
the
slow
train
from
paris
to
luchon
on
the
night
of
the
of
december
last
this
time
the
young
man
looked
anxious
great
scott
he
exclaimed
are
you
in
the
employment
of
my
future
juve
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
first
acknowledge
that
you
did
travel
by
that
train
on
that
night
that
you
got
into
it
at
vierzon
where
you
live
and
where
you
are
going
to
be
married
and
that
you
were
going
to
limoges
to
see
a
lady
and
that
you
did
not
want
your
fiancée
family
to
know
anything
about
it
gervais
aventin
pulled
himself
together
i
had
no
idea
that
the
official
police
undertook
espionage
of
that
sort
he
said
rather
drily
but
it
is
true
sir
that
i
went
to
limoges
my
last
post
before
i
was
appointed
to
vierzon
to
take
a
final
farewell
to
a
lady
but
since
you
are
so
accurately
informed
about
all
this
since
you
even
know
what
train
i
went
by
a
train
i
deliberately
chose
because
in
little
places
like
vierzon
so
much
notice
is
taken
of
people
who
travel
by
the
express
you
must
also
know
juve
checked
him
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
a
truce
to
jesting
he
said
excuse
me
sir
i
was
only
amusing
myself
by
observing
once
more
how
quickly
decent
people
who
have
a
little
peccadillo
on
their
conscience
are
disturbed
when
they
think
they
have
been
found
out
your
love
affairs
do
not
matter
to
me
sir
i
do
want
to
know
if
you
have
a
lady
friend
or
not
the
information
i
want
from
you
is
of
a
very
different
nature
tell
me
simply
this
in
what
circumstances
did
you
make
that
journey
what
carriage
did
you
get
into
who
travelled
with
you
in
that
carriage
i
am
asking
you
because
sir
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
you
travelled
that
night
with
a
murderer
who
committed
a
crime
of
particular
atrocity
and
i
think
you
may
be
able
to
give
me
some
interesting
information
the
young
man
who
had
been
looking
grave
smiled
once
more
i
would
rather
have
that
than
an
enquiry
into
my
defunct
love
affairs
well
sir
i
got
into
the
train
at
vierzon
into
a
carriage
what
kind
of
carriage
one
of
the
corridor
carriages
that
is
to
say
not
a
corridor
communicating
with
the
other
carriages
but
a
single
carriage
with
four
compartments
two
in
the
middle
opening
on
to
the
corridor
and
two
at
the
ends
communicating
with
the
corridor
by
a
small
door
i
know
said
juve
the
lavatory
is
in
the
centre
and
the
end
compartments
are
like
the
ordinary
noncorridor
compartments
except
that
they
have
only
seven
seats
and
also
have
the
little
door
communicating
with
the
narrow
passage
down
one
side
of
the
carriage
that
it
i
got
into
the
smoking
compartment
at
the
end
do
go
too
quick
said
juve
tell
me
whom
you
saw
in
the
various
compartments
let
us
go
even
farther
back
you
were
on
the
platform
waiting
for
the
train
it
came
in
what
happened
then
you
want
to
be
very
precise
gervais
aventin
remarked
well
when
the
train
pulled
up
i
looked
for
the
carriage
it
was
a
few
yards
away
from
me
and
the
corridor
was
alongside
the
platform
i
got
into
the
corridor
and
wanted
to
choose
my
compartment
i
remember
clearly
that
i
went
first
to
the
rear
compartment
the
last
one
in
the
carriage
i
could
not
get
into
that
for
the
door
opening
into
it
from
the
corridor
was
locked
that
is
correct
juve
nodded
i
know
from
the
guard
that
that
compartment
was
empty
what
did
you
do
then
i
turned
back
and
passing
the
ladies
compartment
and
the
lavatory
decided
to
take
my
seat
in
the
one
next
it
communicating
with
the
corridor
but
luck
was
against
me
a
pane
of
glass
was
broken
and
it
was
bitterly
cold
there
so
i
had
to
fall
back
on
the
only
compartment
left
the
smoking
one
towards
the
front
of
the
train
were
there
many
of
you
there
i
thought
at
first
that
i
was
going
to
have
a
for
there
was
some
luggage
and
a
rug
arranged
on
the
seat
but
the
passenger
must
have
been
in
the
lavatory
for
i
did
see
him
i
lay
down
on
the
other
seat
and
went
to
sleep
when
i
got
out
of
the
train
at
limoges
my
must
have
been
in
the
lavatory
again
for
i
remember
quite
distinctly
that
he
was
not
on
the
opposite
seat
i
thought
at
the
time
how
easy
it
would
have
been
for
me
to
steal
his
luggage
and
walk
off
with
his
valise
nobody
would
have
seen
me
juve
had
listened
intently
to
every
word
of
the
story
he
asked
for
one
further
detail
with
a
certain
anxiety
in
his
tone
tell
me
sir
when
you
woke
up
did
you
have
any
impression
that
the
baggage
arranged
on
the
seat
opposite
yours
had
been
disturbed
at
all
might
the
traveller
whom
you
did
not
see
have
come
in
for
a
sleep
while
you
yourself
were
asleep
gervais
aventin
made
a
little
gesture
of
uncertainty
i
ca
answer
in
the
affirmative
juve
i
did
not
notice
that
and
besides
when
i
got
into
the
compartment
the
shade
was
pulled
down
over
the
lamp
and
the
curtains
were
drawn
across
the
windows
i
hardly
saw
how
the
things
were
arranged
and
then
when
i
got
out
at
limoges
i
was
in
a
hurry
and
only
thought
about
finding
my
ticket
and
jumping
on
to
the
platform
but
i
do
not
think
the
other
fellow
did
take
his
place
while
i
was
asleep
i
did
not
hear
a
sound
and
yet
i
did
not
sleep
at
all
heavily
so
you
travelled
in
a
compartment
in
the
slow
train
from
paris
to
luchon
on
the
night
of
the
of
december
and
in
that
compartment
there
was
the
luggage
of
a
traveller
whom
you
did
not
see
who
may
not
have
been
there
yes
said
gervais
aventin
and
as
the
detective
sat
silent
for
a
moment
he
enquired
is
my
information
too
vague
to
be
of
any
use
to
you
juve
was
wondering
inwardly
why
the
dickens
etienne
rambert
was
not
in
that
compartment
when
according
to
the
depositions
of
the
guard
he
must
have
been
there
but
he
said
nothing
of
this
instead
he
said
your
information
is
most
valuable
sir
you
have
told
me
everything
i
wanted
to
know
gervais
aventin
displayed
still
more
surprise
well
he
said
by
way
of
return
juve
tell
me
something
which
puzzles
me
how
did
you
know
i
travelled
by
that
train
that
night
the
detective
drew
out
his
and
from
an
inner
pocket
produced
a
ticket
which
he
held
out
to
the
engineer
that
is
very
simple
he
replied
here
is
your
ticket
i
wanted
to
know
exactly
who
everyone
was
who
travelled
in
that
compartment
so
i
sent
for
all
the
tickets
which
were
given
up
by
passengers
who
left
the
train
at
the
different
stations
how
i
got
yours
it
had
been
issued
at
vierzon
the
station
where
you
got
in
so
i
interrogated
the
clerk
at
the
who
gave
me
a
description
of
you
then
i
sent
down
an
inspector
to
vierzon
to
make
discreet
enquiries
and
he
got
me
all
the
information
i
required
all
i
had
to
do
then
was
to
write
and
ask
you
to
come
here
and
the
regrettable
story
of
your
broken
relations
with
the
lady
was
an
ample
guarantee
to
me
that
you
would
be
punctual
at
the
appointment
xix
jérôme
fandor
whistling
a
sure
sign
with
him
of
a
light
heart
juve
opened
the
door
of
the
little
room
where
he
had
left
charles
rambert
and
looked
at
the
sleeping
lad
it
a
fine
thing
to
be
young
he
remarked
to
the
man
he
had
left
on
guard
that
boy
plunges
into
the
wildest
adventures
and
shaves
the
scaffold
by
an
inch
and
yet
after
one
late
night
he
sleeps
as
peacefully
as
any
chancellor
of
the
legion
of
honour
he
shook
the
lad
with
a
friendly
hand
get
up
it
ten
high
time
for
me
to
carry
you
off
where
to
the
unhappy
boy
asked
rubbing
his
eyes
there
no
doubt
about
inquisitiveness
being
your
besetting
sin
juve
replied
cryptically
well
we
got
a
quarter
of
an
hour
drive
in
front
of
us
but
you
not
going
to
prison
i
going
to
take
you
home
with
me
juve
had
taken
off
his
collar
and
tie
and
put
on
an
old
jacket
had
set
a
great
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
in
front
of
charles
rambert
and
was
leisurely
enjoying
his
own
breakfast
i
did
want
to
answer
any
questions
just
now
he
said
because
i
hate
talking
in
cabs
where
i
have
to
sit
by
a
man
side
and
ca
see
him
or
hear
half
he
says
but
now
that
we
are
snug
and
comfortable
here
i
no
right
to
keep
you
waiting
any
longer
and
i
give
you
a
bit
of
good
news
snug
and
comfortable
were
the
right
words
with
which
to
describe
juve
private
abode
the
detective
had
attained
an
honourable
and
lucrative
position
in
his
profession
and
exposed
as
he
was
in
the
course
of
his
work
to
all
manner
of
dangers
and
privations
had
compensated
himself
by
making
an
entirely
satisfactory
if
not
luxurious
nest
where
he
could
rest
after
his
labours
when
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
he
lighted
a
big
cigar
and
sank
into
an
easy
chair
crossing
his
hands
behind
his
head
he
turned
a
steady
gaze
upon
charles
rambert
who
was
still
completely
puzzled
and
half
frightened
by
this
sudden
amiability
and
did
not
know
whether
he
was
a
prisoner
or
not
i
will
give
you
a
bit
of
good
news
that
is
that
you
are
innocent
of
the
langrune
affair
when
you
were
charles
rambert
and
innocent
also
of
the
danidoff
affair
when
you
were
mademoiselle
jeanne
i
need
not
say
anything
about
the
scrap
last
night
in
which
you
played
a
still
more
distinguished
part
why
tell
me
that
asked
charles
rambert
nervously
of
course
i
know
i
did
not
rob
princess
sonia
danidoff
but
how
did
you
recognise
me
last
night
and
how
did
you
find
out
that
i
was
mademoiselle
jeanne
juve
smiled
and
shook
back
a
lock
of
hair
that
was
falling
over
his
eyes
listen
my
boy
do
you
suppose
that
thundering
blow
you
dealt
the
excellent
henri
verbier
when
he
was
making
love
to
mademoiselle
jeanne
could
fail
to
make
me
determined
to
find
out
who
that
young
lady
was
who
had
the
strength
of
a
man
the
allusion
made
charles
rambert
most
uneasy
but
that
does
not
explain
how
you
recognised
me
in
paul
i
recognised
you
in
henri
verbier
at
the
hotel
but
i
had
no
idea
that
it
was
you
last
night
that
nothing
said
juve
with
a
shake
of
the
head
and
you
may
understand
once
for
all
that
when
i
have
once
looked
anybody
square
in
the
face
he
needs
to
be
an
uncommonly
clever
fellow
to
escape
me
afterwards
by
means
of
any
disguise
you
do
know
how
to
make
up
but
i
do
and
that
why
i
took
you
in
and
you
did
not
take
me
in
what
makes
you
believe
i
did
not
rob
princess
sonia
danidoff
charles
rambert
asked
after
a
pause
i
am
quite
aware
that
everything
points
to
my
having
been
the
thief
not
quite
everything
juve
answered
gently
there
are
one
or
two
things
you
do
know
and
i
tell
you
one
of
them
the
princess
was
robbed
by
the
same
man
who
robbed
mme
van
den
rosen
was
she
well
mme
van
den
rosen
was
the
victim
of
a
burglary
some
of
the
furniture
in
her
room
was
broken
into
and
the
tests
i
made
this
morning
with
the
dynamometer
proved
to
me
that
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
have
caused
those
fractures
not
strong
enough
charles
rambert
ejaculated
no
i
told
you
at
the
time
that
your
innocence
would
be
proved
if
you
were
strong
enough
but
i
said
that
to
prevent
you
from
playing
tricks
and
not
putting
out
all
your
strength
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
your
comparative
weakness
that
saved
you
the
dynamometer
tests
and
the
figures
i
obtained
just
now
prove
absolutely
that
you
are
innocent
of
the
van
den
rosen
robbery
and
consequently
of
the
robbery
from
sonia
danidoff
again
the
lad
reflected
for
a
minute
or
two
but
you
did
know
who
i
was
when
you
came
to
the
hotel
did
you
and
therefore
had
no
suspicion
that
i
was
charles
rambert
that
true
is
it
how
did
you
find
out
i
was
supposed
to
be
dead
that
was
a
child
job
juve
replied
i
got
the
anthropometric
records
of
the
body
that
had
been
buried
as
yours
and
i
planned
to
get
symmetrical
photographs
of
you
in
your
character
of
mademoiselle
jeanne
as
i
did
of
you
at
my
first
job
was
to
lay
hands
upon
mademoiselle
jeanne
and
i
very
soon
found
her
as
i
expected
turned
into
a
man
again
and
living
in
the
most
disreputable
company
i
made
any
number
of
enquiries
and
when
i
went
to
the
pig
last
evening
i
knew
that
it
was
some
unknown
person
who
had
been
buried
in
your
stead
that
paul
was
mademoiselle
jeanne
and
that
mademoiselle
jeanne
was
charles
rambert
it
was
my
intention
to
arrest
you
and
to
ascertain
definitely
by
means
of
the
dynamometer
that
you
were
innocent
of
the
langrune
and
the
danidoff
crimes
what
you
tell
me
about
the
dynamometer
explains
how
you
know
i
am
not
the
man
who
committed
the
robbery
at
the
hotel
but
what
clears
me
in
your
eyes
of
the
langrune
murder
bless
my
soul
juve
retorted
you
are
arguing
as
if
you
wanted
to
prove
you
were
guilty
well
my
boy
it
the
same
story
as
the
other
the
man
who
murdered
the
marquise
de
langrune
smashed
things
and
the
dynamometer
has
proved
that
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
have
been
the
man
and
suppose
i
had
been
mad
at
the
time
charles
rambert
said
his
hesitation
and
his
tone
betraying
his
anxiety
about
the
answer
could
i
have
been
strong
enough
then
might
i
have
committed
these
crimes
without
knowing
anything
about
it
but
juve
shook
his
head
i
know
you
are
referring
to
your
mother
and
are
haunted
by
an
idea
that
through
some
hereditary
taint
you
might
be
a
somnambulist
and
have
done
these
things
in
your
sleep
come
charles
rambert
finish
your
breakfast
and
put
all
that
out
of
your
head
to
begin
with
you
would
not
have
been
strong
enough
even
then
and
in
the
next
place
there
is
nothing
at
present
to
show
that
you
are
mad
nor
even
that
your
poor
mother
but
i
need
not
go
on
i
got
some
rather
odd
notions
on
that
subject
then
juve
drop
the
call
me
then
if
you
know
that
i
am
innocent
you
can
go
and
tell
my
father
i
have
nothing
to
fear
i
can
reappear
in
my
own
name
juve
looked
at
the
lad
with
an
ironical
smile
how
you
go
ahead
he
exclaimed
please
understand
that
although
i
do
believe
you
are
innocent
i
am
almost
certainly
the
only
person
who
does
and
unfortunately
i
have
not
yet
got
any
evidence
that
would
be
sufficiently
convincing
and
certain
to
put
the
persuasion
of
your
guilt
out
of
your
father
head
or
anybody
else
this
is
not
the
time
for
you
to
reappear
it
would
simply
mean
that
you
would
be
arrested
by
some
detective
who
knows
less
than
i
do
and
thrown
into
prison
as
you
confidently
expected
to
be
this
morning
then
what
is
to
become
of
me
what
do
you
think
of
doing
yourself
going
to
see
my
father
no
no
juve
protested
once
more
i
tell
you
not
to
go
it
would
be
stupid
and
utterly
useless
wait
a
few
days
a
few
weeks
if
need
be
when
i
have
put
my
hand
on
fantômas
shoulder
i
will
be
the
very
first
to
take
you
to
your
father
and
proclaim
your
innocence
why
wait
until
fantômas
is
arrested
charles
rambert
asked
the
mere
sound
of
the
name
seeming
to
wake
all
his
former
enthusiasm
on
the
subject
of
that
famous
criminal
because
if
you
are
innocent
of
the
charge
brought
against
you
it
is
extremely
likely
that
fantômas
is
the
guilty
party
when
he
is
laid
by
the
heels
you
will
be
able
to
protest
your
innocence
without
any
fear
charles
rambert
sat
silent
for
some
minutes
musing
on
the
odd
chance
of
destiny
which
required
him
to
make
his
own
return
to
normal
life
contingent
on
the
arrest
of
a
mysterious
criminal
who
was
merely
suspected
and
had
never
been
seen
nor
discovered
what
do
you
advise
me
to
do
he
asked
presently
the
detective
got
up
and
began
to
pace
the
room
well
he
began
the
first
fact
is
that
i
am
interested
in
you
and
the
next
is
that
while
i
was
having
that
last
night
with
that
scoundrel
in
the
i
thought
for
a
minute
or
two
that
it
was
all
up
with
me
your
chipping
in
saved
my
life
on
the
other
hand
i
may
be
said
to
have
saved
your
life
now
by
ascertaining
your
innocence
and
preventing
your
arrest
so
we
are
quits
in
a
way
but
you
began
the
delicate
attentions
and
i
have
only
paid
you
back
so
it
up
to
me
to
start
a
new
series
and
not
turn
you
out
into
the
street
where
you
would
inevitably
get
into
fresh
trouble
so
this
is
what
i
propose
change
your
name
and
go
and
take
a
room
somewhere
get
into
proper
clothes
and
then
come
back
to
me
and
i
give
you
a
letter
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
on
one
of
the
big
evening
papers
you
are
well
educated
and
i
know
you
are
energetic
you
are
keen
on
everything
connected
with
the
police
and
you
get
on
splendidly
as
a
reporter
you
will
be
able
to
earn
an
honest
and
respectable
name
that
way
would
you
like
to
try
that
idea
it
awfully
good
of
you
charles
rambert
said
gratefully
i
should
love
to
be
able
to
earn
my
living
by
work
so
much
to
my
taste
juve
cut
his
thanks
short
and
held
out
some
there
some
money
now
clear
out
it
high
time
we
both
got
a
little
sleep
get
busy
settling
into
rooms
and
in
a
fortnight
i
shall
expect
you
to
be
editor
of
under
what
name
shall
you
introduce
me
to
your
friend
charles
rambert
asked
after
a
little
nervous
pause
h
said
juve
with
a
smile
it
will
have
to
be
an
alias
of
course
yes
and
as
it
will
be
the
name
i
shall
write
under
it
ought
to
be
an
easy
one
to
remember
something
arresting
like
fantômas
said
juve
chaffingly
amused
by
the
curious
childishness
of
this
lad
who
could
take
keen
interest
in
such
a
trifle
when
he
was
in
so
critical
a
situation
choose
something
not
too
common
for
the
first
name
and
something
short
for
the
other
why
not
keep
the
first
syllable
of
fantômas
oh
i
got
it
fandor
what
about
jérôme
fandor
charles
rambert
murmured
it
over
jérôme
fandor
yes
you
are
right
it
sounds
well
juve
pushed
him
out
of
the
door
well
jérôme
fandor
leave
me
to
my
slumbers
and
go
and
rig
yourself
out
and
get
ready
for
the
new
life
that
i
going
to
open
up
for
you
bewildered
by
the
amazing
adventures
of
which
he
had
just
been
the
central
figure
charles
rambert
or
jérôme
fandor
walked
down
staircase
wondering
why
should
he
take
so
much
trouble
about
me
what
interest
or
what
motive
can
he
have
and
how
on
earth
does
he
find
out
such
a
wonderful
lot
of
things

of

after
the
tragic
death
of
her

previous
life
had
inclined
to
the
austere
withdrew
into
almost
complete
retirement
the
world
of
gaiety
and
fashion
knew
her
no
more
but
in
the
world
where
poverty
and
suffering
reign
in
hospital
wards
and
squalid
streets
a
tall
and
beautiful
woman
might
often
be
seen
robed
all
in
black
with
distinguished
bearing
and
eyes
serene
and
grave
distributing
alms
and
consolation
as
she
moved

lady
beltham
kind
good
and
very
pitiful
bent
on
the
work
of
charity
to
which
she
had
vowed
her
days
yet
she
had
not
allowed
herself
to
be
crushed
by
sorrow
after
the
tragedy
which
left
her
a
widow
she
had
assumed
the
effective
control
of
her
husband
property
and

by
faithful
friends
had
carried
on
his
interests
and
administered
his
estates

a
halo
of
kindness

around

her
in

heavy
correspondence
entailed
by
all
these
affairs

secretaries
none
too
many

recommendation
thérèse

was
now
one
of
these
and

young
girl

perfectly
happy

the
garden
and
the
boulevard
richard
wallace
beyond
with
the
bois
de
boulogne
beyond
that
again
a
few
minutes
before
a
footman
had
brought
in
a
table
and
set
out
and
lady
beltham
was
reading
while
thérèse
and
the
two
young
english
girls
were
chattering
among
themselves
the
telephone
bell
rang
and
thérèse
answered
it
hullo
yes
yes
you
want
to
know
if
you
may
call
this
evening
the
reverend
oh
yes
you
have
just
come
from
scotland
hold
on
a
minute
she
turned
to
lady
beltham
it
is
william
hope
and
he
wants
to
know
if
you
will
see
him
he
has
just
come
from
your
place
in
scotland
the
dear
man
exclaimed
lady
beltham
of
course
he
may
come
and
as
thérèse
turned
lightly
to
convey
her
permission
to
the
clergyman
waiting
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
she
caught
a
smile
on
the
face
of
one
of
the
other
girls
what
is
the
joke
lisbeth
she
enquired
the
girl
laughed
brightly
i
think
the
worthy
parson
must
have
smelt
the
tea
and
toast
and
wants
to
make
up
for
the
wretched
dinner
he
got
in
the
train
you
are
incorrigible
lady
beltham
replied
hope
is
above
such
material
matters
indeed
he
is
lady
beltham
the
girl
persisted
why
only
the
other
day
he
told
thérèse
that
all
food
deserved
respect
and
esteem
directly
a
blessing
had
been
asked
upon
it
and
that
a
badly
cooked
steak
was
a
kind
of
sacrilege
a
badly
cooked
pheasant
thérèse
corrected
her
you
are
both
wicked
little
slanderers
lady
beltham
protested
gently
and
do
know
the
blessing
a
good
appetite
is
you
do
susannah
you
susannah
a
pretty
irish
girl
looked
up
from
a
letter
she
was
reading
and
blushed
oh
lady
beltham
i
been
ever
so
much
less
hungry
since
harry
ship
sailed
i
do
quite
see
the
connection
lady
beltham
answered
love
is
good
nourishment
for
the
soul
but
not
for
the
body
however
a
good
appetite
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
and
you
ought
to
keep
your
roses
for
your
future
husband
and
qualify
in
every
way
to
be
an
excellent
mother
of
a
family
with
lots
and
lots
of
children
lisbeth
went
on
wickedly
seven
or
eight
daughters
at
the
very
least
all
of
whom
will
marry
nice
young
clergymen
when
their
time
comes
and
she
stopped
speaking
and
the
light
chatter
died
away
as
a
footman
entered
and
announced
the
reverend
william
hope
who
followed
him
immediately
into
the
room
an
elderly
man
with
a
full
face
and
a
comfortable
portliness
of
figure
lady
beltham
offered
him
a
cordial
hand
i
am
delighted
you
are
back
she
said
will
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
with
us
the
parson
made
a
general
bow
to
the
girls
gathered
about
the
table
i
got
a
wretched
dinner
in
the
train
he
began
but
lisbeth
interrupted
him
do
you
think
this
tea
smells
delicious
she
asked
the
parson
put
out
his
hand
to
take
the
cup
she
offered
to
him
and
bowed
and
smiled
precisely
what
i
was
going
to
observe
miss
lisbeth
thérèse
and
susannah
turned
away
to
hide
their
amusement
and
lady
beltham
adroitly
changed
the
subject
she
moved
towards
her
hope
must
have
much
to
tell
me
girls
and
it
is
getting
late
i
must
get
to
business
did
you
have
a
good
journey
quite
as
good
as
usual
lady
beltham
the
people
at
scotwell
hill
are
very
plucky
and
good
but
it
will
be
a
hard
winter
there
is
snow
on
the
hills
already
have
the
women
and
children
had
all
their
woollen
things
oh
yes
twelve
hundred
garments
have
been
distributed
according
to
a
list
drawn
up
by
the
here
it
is
and
he
handed
a
paper
to
lady
beltham
who
passed
it
on
to
susannah
i
will
ask
you
to
check
the
list
she
said
to
the
girl
and
turned
again
to
the
clergyman
the
is
a
good
fellow
but
he
is
a
rabid
politician
he
may
have
omitted
some
families
that
are
openly
radical
but
i
think
charity
should
be
given
equally
to
all
for
poverty
makes
no
political
distinctions
that
is
the
right
christian
view
the
clergyman
said
approvingly
and
what
about
the
sanatorium
at
glasgow
lady
beltham
went
on
it
is
very
nearly
finished
the
good
man
answered
i
have
got
your
lawyers
to
cut
down
the
contractor
accounts
by
something
like
fifteen
per
cent
which
means
a
saving
of
nearly
three
hundred
pounds
excellent
said
lady
beltham
and
she
turned
to
thérèse
you
must
add
that
three
hundred
pounds
to
the
funds
of
the
scotwell
hill
coal
charity
she
said
they
will
want
all
of
it
if
the
winter
is
going
to
be
a
hard
one
and
thérèse
made
a
note
of
the
instruction
full
of
admiration
for
lady
beltham
simple
generosity
but
hope
was
fidgeting
on
his
chair
he
seized
an
opportunity
when
lady
beltham
busy
making
notes
had
turned
her
deep
and
steady
eyes
away
from
him
to
say
in
a
low
tone
have
i
your
permission
just
to
mention
poor
lord
beltham
lady
beltham
started
and
her
face
betrayed
an
emotion
which
she
bravely
controlled
hearing
the
name
pronounced
the
three
girls
withdrew
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
where
they
began
to
talk
among
themselves
lady
beltham
signified
her
assent
and
hope
began
you
know
dear
friend
this
has
been
my
first
visit
to
scotland
since
lord
beltham
death
i
found
your
tenants
still
grievously
upset
by
the
tragedy
that
occurred
nearly
a
year
ago
they
have
got
by
heart
all
the
newspaper
accounts
of
the
mysterious
circumstances
attending
lord
beltham
death
but
those
are
not
enough
to
satisfy
the
sympathetic
curiosity
of
these
excellent
people
and
i
was
obliged
to
tell
them
over
and
over
again
in
full
detail
all
we
knew
i
hope
no
scandal
has
gathered
round
his
name
said
lady
beltham
quickly
you
need
have
no
fear
of
that
the
clergyman
replied
in
the
same
low
tone
the
rumour
that
got
about
when
the
crime
was
first
discovered
that
lord
beltham
had
been
surprised
in
an
intrigue
and
killed
in
revenge
has
not
won
acceptance
local
opinion
agrees
that
he
was
decoyed
into
a
trap
and
killed
by
the
man
gurn
who
meant
to
rob
him
but
who
was
either
surprised
or
thought
he
was
going
to
be
and
fled
before
he
had
time
to
take
the
money
or
the
jewels
from
the
body
of
his
victim
they
know
that
the
murderer
has
never
been
caught
but
they
also
know
that
there
is
a
price
on
his
head
and
they
all
hope
the
police
oh
forgive
me
for
recalling
all
these
painful
memories
while
he
had
been
speaking
lady
beltham
face
had
expressed
almost
every
shade
of
emotion
and
distress
it
seemed
to
be
drawn
with
pain
at
his
concluding
words
but
she
made
an
effort
to
control
herself
and
spoke
resignedly
it
can
not
be
helped
dear
hope
go
on
but
the
clergyman
changed
the
topic
oh
i
was
quite
forgetting
he
said
more
brightly
the
has
turned
out
the
two
tillys
quite
on
his
own
authority
you
must
remember
them
two
brothers
blacksmiths
who
drank
a
great
deal
and
paid
very
little
and
created
so
much
scandal
in
the
place
i
object
to
the
doing
any
such
thing
without
referring
to
me
first
lady
beltham
exclaimed
warmly
man
duty
is
to
persuade
and
forgive
not
to
judge
and
punish
kindness
breeds
kindness
and
it
is
pity
that
wins
amendment
why
should
a
subordinate
my
presume
to
do
what
i
would
not
permit
myself
to
do
she
had
sprung
to
her
feet
and
was
pacing
excitedly
about
the
room
she
had
wholly
dropped
the
impassive
mask
she
habitually
wore
concealing
her
real
personality
the
three
girls
watched
her
in
silence
the
door
opened
anew
and
silbertown
came
in
the
of
lady
beltham
establishment
at
neuilly
he
brought
the
evening
letters
and
the
girls
speedily
took
all
the
envelopes
and
newspapers
from
the
tray
and
began
to
sort
and
open
them
while
the
entered
into
conversation
with
his
mistress
and
the
rev
william
hope
seized
the
opportunity
to
say
good
night
and
take
his
leave
many
of
the
letters
were
merely
appeals
to
help
in
money
or
in
kind
but
one
long
letter
lisbeth
handed
to
lady
beltham
she
glanced
at
the
signature
ah
here
is
news
of
etienne
rambert
she
exclaimed
and
as
thérèse
instinctively
drew
near
knowing
that
she
too
might
hear
something
of
what
her
old
friend
had
written
lady
beltham
put
the
letter
into
her
hand
you
read
it
my
dear
and
then
you
can
tell
me
presently
what
he
has
to
say
thérèse
read
the
letter
eagerly
etienne
rambert
had
left
paris
a
week
before
upon
a
long
and
important
journey
the
energetic
old
fellow
was
to
make
a
trip
in
germany
first
and
then
go
from
hamburg
to
england
where
he
had
some
business
to
attend
to
on
behalf
of
lady
beltham
with
whom
he
was
on
more
confidential
terms
than
ever
then
he
meant
to
sail
from
southampton
and
spend
the
winter
in
colombia
where
he
had
important
interests
of
his
own
to
look
after
while
thérèse
was
reading
lady
beltham
continued
her
conversation
with
her
i
am
glad
you
had
the
park
gate
seen
to
this
afternoon
she
said
you
know
how
nervous
i
am
my
childhood
in
scotland
was
very
lonely
and
ever
since
then
i
have
had
a
vague
terror
of
solitude
and
darkness
the
reassured
her
he
had
no
lack
of
there
is
nothing
for
your
ladyship
to
be
afraid
of
the
house

perfectly
safe
and
carefully
guarded
walter
the
porter
is
a
and
always
sleeps
with
one
eye
open
and
i
too
yes
i
know
silbertown
the
young
widow
replied
and
when
i
give
myself
time
to
think
i
am
not
nervous
thank
you
you
can
leave
me
now
she
turned
to
the
three
girls
i
am
tired
dears
we
wo
stay
up
any
later
lisbeth
and
susannah
kissed
her
affectionately
and
went
away
thérèse
lingered
a
moment
to
bring
a
book
a
bible
and
place
it
on
a
table
close
to
lady
beltham
chair
lady
beltham
laid
a
hand
upon
her
head
as
if
in
blessing
and
said
gently
good
night
god
bless
you
dear
child
xxi
lord
beltham
murderer
it
was
on
the
point
of
midnight
and
absolute
stillness
reigned
throughout
the
house
but
lady
beltham
had
not
gone
to
bed
although
she
had
remained
in
the
great
hall
where
she
did
her
work
she
had
been
unable
to
settle
down
to
any
occupation
she
had
read
a
little
and
begun
a
letter
got
up
and
sat
down
and
finally
beginning
to
feel
chilly
she
had
drawn
an
easy
chair
up
to
the
hearth
where
a
log
was
just
burning
out
and
stretching
out
her
slippers
to
the
warmth
had
fallen
into
a
waking
dream
a
sound
caught
her
ear
and
she
sat
upright
at
first
she
thought
it
was
some
trick
of
the
imagination
but
in
another
minute
the
noise
grew
louder
there
was
the
hurrying
of
feet
and
voices
muffled
at
first
but
rapidly
becoming
louder
and
at
last
a
regular
uproar
doors
banging
glass
breaking
and
shouts
from
all
parts
of
the
house
lady
beltham
jumped
up
nervous
and
trembling
she
was
just
going
to
the
window
when
she
heard
a
shot
and
stopped
dead
where
she
stood
then
she
rushed
out
into
the
vestibule
help
she
screamed
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
and
remembering
the
girls
for
whom
she
had
assumed
responsibility
she
called
out
anxiously
for
them
lisbeth
thérèse
susannah
come
to
me
doors
upstairs
were
flung
open
and
with
their
hair
streaming
over
their
thérèse
and
susannah
rushed
downstairs
and
crouched
down
by
her
side
stifling
moans
of
terror
lisbeth
where
is
lisbeth
lady
beltham
asked
sharply
at
the
same
moment
she
appeared
her
face
distorted
with
fright
oh
lady
beltham
it
dreadful
there
a
man
a
burglar
in
the
garden
and
walter
is
throttling
him
they
are
fighting
dreadfully
they
kill
one
another
silbertown
the
came
rushing
in
just
then
seeing
the
three
girls
in
their
he
made
as
if
to
draw
back
but
lady
beltham
called
him
in
and
demanded
explanations
we
had
just
finished
our
rounds
he
answered
breathlessly
when
we
caught
sight
of
a
man
hiding
in
the
shadows
a
thief
probably
when
we
shouted
to
him
he
ran
away
but
we
ran
after
him
and
seized
him
he
resisted
and
there
was
a
fight
but
we
have
got
him
and
the
police
will
take
him
away
in
a
few
minutes
lady
beltham
listened
with
jaw
set
and
hands
clenched
a
thief
she
said
controlling
her
emotion
how
do
you
know
he
is
a
thief
well
stammered
the
he
is
very
poorly
dressed
and
besides
what
was
he
doing
in
the
garden
lady
beltham
was
recovering
her
calm
what
excuse
did
he
give
for
being
there
she
asked
coldly
we
did
give
him
time
to
invent
one
said
the
we
collared
him
almost
as
soon
as
we
saw
him
and
you
know
madame
how
tremendously
powerful
walter
is
walter
gave
him
all
he
deserved
and
the
clenched
his
fists
and
made
an
expressive
exhibition
of
the
porter
reception
of
the
stranger
lisbeth
was
still
overcome
by
what
she
had
seen
oh
the
blood
she
muttered
hysterically
it
was
streaming
lady
beltham
spoke
angrily
to
the
i
hate
brutality
is
the
man
seriously
hurt
i
hope
not
you
ought
to
have
questioned
him
before
assaulting
him
no
one
in
my
house
has
a
right
to
use
violence
smites
with
the
sword
shall
perish
by
the
sword
the
heard
her
in
silent
astonishment
it
was
not
at
all
what
he
expected
to
be
told
in
view
of
all
the
circumstances
lady
beltham
went
on
more
gently
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
apologise
to
this
man
for
your
wrong
and
thoughtless
behaviour
apologise
exclaimed
silbertown
in
amazement
surely
your
ladyship
will
not
do
that
one
must
not
shrink
from
humiliation
when
one
has
been
in
the
wrong
said
lady
beltham
in
the
pulpit
manner
she
affected
tell
walter
to
come
to
me
a
few
minutes
later
the
porter
a
muscular
giant
of
a
man
came
into
the
room
and
made
a
clumsy
bow
how
was
it
possible
for
anyone
to
get
into
the
house
at
this
time
of
night
his
mistress
enquired
coldly
walter
dropped
his
eyes
and
twisted
his
cap
nervously
i
hope
your
ladyship
will
forgive
me
i
caught
the
fellow
and
as
he
was
struggling
i
hit
him
then
two
of
the
footmen
came
and
they
are
looking
after
him
in
the
kitchen
has
he
given
any
explanation
of
his
presence
here
since
you
assaulted
him
at
which
i
am
very
angry
said
lady
beltham
he
has
said
anything
at
least
well
i
do
like
to
tell
you
please
do
like
said
lady
beltham
irritably
well
walter
replied
overcoming
his
nervousness
with
an
effort
he
says
your
ladyship
is
well
known
for
your
charity
to
everybody
and
he
wants
to
see
you
there
was
a
moment
pause
i
will
see
him
said
lady
beltham
at
last
in
a
voice
will
your
ladyship
allow
me
to
point
out
the
danger
of
doing
any
such
thing
silbertown
exclaimed
very
likely
the
man
is
a
lunatic
or
it
may
be
a
trick
lord
beltham
was
murdered
and
perhaps
lady
beltham
looked
intently
at
the
seemingly
trying
to
read
his
thoughts
then
she
answered
slowly
i
will
see
him
i
will
be
more
pitiful
than
you
and
as
the
and
the
porter
made
a
gesture
of
futile
protest
she
added
peremptorily
i
have
given
my
orders
kindly
obey
when
the
two
men
had
reluctantly
left
the
room
lady
beltham
turned
to
the
three
girls
you
had
better
leave
me
darlings
she
said
kindly
but
firmly
run
away
excitement
is
bad
for
you
go
back
to
bed
no
i
assure
you
i
shall
be
in
no
danger
whatever
and
for
a
few
minutes
she
was
left
alone
speak
said
lady
beltham
in
a
toneless
voice
the
and
the
porter
had
led
in
and
placed
before
her
a
man
with
unkempt
hair
and
ragged
beard
he
was
dressed
entirely
in
black
and
his
face
was
tired
and
haggard
lady
beltham
ghastly
pale
was
leaning
for
support
against
the
back
of
an
the
man
did
not
raise
his
eyes
to
her
i
will
not
speak
unless
we
are
alone
he
answered
dully
alone
said
lady
beltham
fighting
down
her
emotion
then
it
is
something
serious
you
have
to
tell
me
if
you
know
anything
of
people
in
misfortune
madame
the
man
answered
gently
you
know
that
they
do
not
like
to
humiliate
themselves
before
before
those
who
can
not
understand
and
he
nodded
towards
the
and
the
porter
i
do
know
something
of
misfortune
lady
beltham
replied
in
firmer
tones
and
i
will
hear
you
alone
she
looked
at
her
two
servants
leave
us
please
the
started
leave
you
alone
with
him
it
madness
and
as
lady
beltham
merely
looked
at
him
in
haughty
surprise
he
began
to
withdraw
in
confusion
but
still
protesting
it
it
your
ladyship
has
no
idea
what
this
fellow
wants
do
please
but
lady
beltham
curtly
cut
him
short
that
is
enough
a
heavy
velvet
curtain
fell
over
the
closing
door
and
in
the
room
that
was
dimly
lighted
by
a
small
electric
lamp
lady
beltham
was
alone
with
the
strange
individual
to
whom
she
had
so
readily
so
oddly
consented
to
accord
a
private
interview
she
followed
her
servants
to
the
door
and
locked
it
after
them
then
with
a
sudden
movement
she
sprang
towards
the
man
who
was
standing
motionless
in
the
middle
of
the
room
following
her
with
his
eyes
and
flung
herself
into
his
arms
oh
gurn
my
darling
my
darling
she
cried
i
love
you
i
love
you
darling
she
looked
up
at
him
and
saw
blood
upon
his
forehead
good
god
the
brutes
have
hurt
you
what
pain
you
must
be
in
give
me
your
eyes
your
lips
with
kisses
from
her
own
lips
she
stanched
the
blood
that
was
trickling
down
his
cheeks
and
with
her
fingers
she
smoothed
his
hair
i
am
so
happy
she
murmured
and
broke
off
again
but
you
are
mad
why
why
come
here
like
this
and
let
yourself
be
caught
and
tortured
so
moodily
gurn
answered
returning
kiss
for
kiss
time
has
been
so
long
without
you
and
this
evening
i
was
prowling
round
and
saw
a
light
i
thought
that
every
one
would
be
asleep
except
you
of
course
and
so
i
came
straight
to
you
over
walls
and
gates
drawn
to
you
like
a
moth
to
a
candle
and
that
is
all
with
shining
eyes
and
heaving
breast
lady
beltham
clung
to
her
lover
i
love
you
so
how
brave
you
are
yes
i
am
wholly
only
yours
but
this
is
madness
you
might
be
arrested
and
given
up
to
no
one
knows
what
horror
without
my
knowing
gurn
seemed
to
be
hypnotised
by
the
fierce
and
passionate
love
of
this
great
lady
i
never
gave
that
a
thought
he
murmured
i
only
thought
of
you
silence
fell
upon
these
tragic
lovers
as
they
stood
reading
love
in
one
another
eyes
and
recalling
memories
common
to
both
utterly
unlike
as
they
were
to
outward
seeming
yet
linked
by
the
strongest
bond
of
all
the
bond
of
love
what
happy
hours
we
lived
together
out
there
lady
beltham
whispered
her
thoughts
had
wandered
to
the
far
transvaal
and
the
where
first
she
had
set
eyes
on
gurn
the
sergeant
of
artillery
with
face
and
then
to
the
homeward
voyage
on
the
mighty
steamer
that
bore
them
across
the
blue
sea
towards
the
dull
white
cliffs
of
england
gurn
thoughts
followed
hers
out
there
yes
and
then
on
the
vast
ocean
on
the
ship
homeward
bound
the
quiet
and
peace
of
it
all
and
our
meetings
every
day
our
long
long
talks
and
longer
silences
in
the
clear
starlight
of
those
tropical
skies
we
were
learning
to
know
each
other
we
were
learning
to
love
each
other
she
said
and
then
london
and
paris
and
all
the
fever
of
life
threatening
our
love
but
that
is
the
strongest
thing
in
the
world
and
do
you
remember
oh
the
ecstasy
of
it
all
but
do
you
remember
too
what
you
did
for
me
through
me
thirteen
months
ago
she
had
risen
and
with
white
lips
and
haggard
eyes
held
gurn
hands
within
her
own
in
an
even
tighter
grip
emotion
choked
her
further
utterance
yes
i
remember
gurn
went
on
slowly
it
was
in
our
little
room
in
the
rue
lévert
and
i
was
on
my
knees
beside
you
when
the
door
opened
quietly
and
there
stood
lord
beltham
mad
with
rage
and
jealousy
i
do
know
what
happened
then
lady
beltham
whispered
in
a
hopeless
undertone
drooping
her
head
again
i
do
muttered
gurn
his
eyes
sought
you
and
a
pistol
was
pointed
at
your
heart
he
would
have
fired
but
i
sprang
and
struck
him
down
and
then
i
strangled
him
lady
beltham
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
man
hands
that
she
still
held
between
her
own
and
i
saw
the
muscles
in
these
hands
swell
up
beneath
the
skin
as
they
tightened
on
his
throat
i
killed
him
groaned
the
man
but
lady
beltham
swept
by
a
surge
of
passion
sprang
up
and
sought
his
lips
oh
gurn
she
sobbed
my
darling
listen
said
gurn
harshly
after
a
pause
of
anxious
silence
i
had
to
see
you
for
who
knows
if
lady
beltham
shrank
at
the
words
but
gurn
went
on
unheeding
the
police
are
after
me
of
course
i
have
made
myself
almost
unrecognisable
but
twice
just
lately
i
have
been
very
nearly
caught
do
you
think
the
police
have
any
accurate
idea
of
what
happened
lady
beltham
asked
abruptly
no
said
gurn
after
a
moment
hesitation
they
think
i
killed
him
with
the
mallet
they
have
not
found
out
that
i
had
to
strangle
him
as
far
as
i
know
they
found
no
marks
of
my
hands
on
his
throat
at
all
events
they
could
not
have
been
clear
for
his
collar
you
understand
the
man
spoke
of
his
crime
without
the
least
sign
of
remorse
or
repugnance
now
his
only
dread
was
lest
he
should
be
caught
but
none
the
less
they
have
identified
me
that
detective
juve
is
very
clever
we
did
not
have
enough
presence
of
mind
lady
beltham
said
despairingly
we
ought
to
have
led
them
to
suspect
someone
else
have
made
them
think
that
it
was
say
fantômas
not
that
said
gurn
nervously
do
talk
about
fantômas
we
did
all
we
could
but
the
main
thing
now
is
that
i
should
escape
them
i
had
better
get
away
across
the
channel
across
the
atlantic
anywhere
but
would
you
come
too
lady
beltham
did
not
hesitate
she
flung
her
arms
around
the
neck
of
the
man
who
had
murdered
her
own
husband
and
yielded
to
a
paroxysm
of
wild
passion
you
know
that
i
am
yours
wherever
you
may
go
shall
it
be
we
can
meet
you
know
where
and
arrange
everything
for
your
flight
my
flight
said
gurn
with
reproachful
emphasis
on
the
pronoun
for
our
flight
she
replied
and
gurn
smiled
again
then
that
is
settled
he
said
i
have
seen
you
and
i
am
happy
he
made
a
step
towards
the
door
but
lady
beltham
stayed
him
gently
wait
she
said
walter
shall
let
you
out
of
the
house
do
not
say
anything
i
will
explain
i
will
invent
some
story
to
satisfy
the
servants
as
to
your
coming
here
and
also
to
justify
your
being
allowed
to
go
they
clung
to
one
another
in
a
parting
caress
lady
beltham
tore
herself
away
till
she
whispered
she
stole
to
the
door
and
unlocked
it
noiselessly
then
crossed
the
room
and
rang
the
bell
placed
near
the
fireplace
resuming
her
impassive
mask
and
the
haughty
air
and
attitude
of
cold
indifference
that
were
in
such
utter
contrast
to
her
real
character
she
waited
while
gurn
stood
upright
and
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
walter
the
porter
came
in
take
that
man
to
the
door
and
let
no
harm
be
done
to
him
said
lady
beltham
proudly
and
authoritatively
he
is
free
without
a
word
or
sign
or
glance
gurn
went
out
of
the
room
and
walter
followed
behind
him
to
obey
his
mistress
command
once
more
alone
in
the
great
hall
lady
beltham
waited
nervously
to
hear
the
sound
of
the
park
gate
closing
behind
gurn
she
did
not
dare
go
on
to
the
balcony
to
follow
her
departing
lover
with
her
eyes
so
shaken
by
her
recent
emotions
she
stood
waiting
and
listening
in
an
agony
to
know
that
he
was
safe
then
of
a
sudden
the
noise
that
she
had
heard
an
hour
before
broke
on
her
ears
again
the
noise
of
hurrying
feet
and
broken
shouts
and
words
vague
at
first
but
rapidly
growing
clearer
she
crouched
forward
listening
filled
with
a
horrible
fear
her
hand
laid
upon
her
scarcely
beating
heart
there
he
is
hold
him
some
one
shouted
that
him
all
right
look
out
constable
this
way
inspector
yes
it
him
it
gurn
ah
would
you
paler
than
death
lady
beltham
cowered
down
upon
a
sofa
good
god
good
god
she
moaned
what
are
they
doing
to
him
the
uproar
in
the
garden
decreased
then
voices
sounded
in
the
corridor
silbertown
exclamations
rising
above
the
frightened
cries
of
the
three
young
girls
gurn
arrested
the
man
who
murdered
lord
beltham
lisbeth
called
out
in
anxious
terror
but
lady
beltham
dear
god
perhaps
he
has
murdered
her
too
the
door
was
flung
open
and
the
girls
rushed
in
lady
beltham
by
a
tremendous
effort
of
will
had
risen
to
her
feet
and
was
standing
by
the
end
of
the
sofa
lady
beltham
alive
yes
yes
and
thérèse
and
lisbeth
and
susannah
rushed
sobbing
to
her
and
smothered
her
with
caresses
but
the
agonised
woman
motioned
them
away
with
hard
eyes
and
set
mouth
she
moved
towards
the
window
straining
her
ears
to
listen
from
the
park
outside
gurn
voice
rang
distinctly
the
lover
wished
to
let
his
mistress
know
what
had
happened
and
to
take
a
last
farewell
i
am
caught
i
am
caught
yes
i
am
gurn
and
i
am
caught
the
fatal
words
were
still
ringing
in
lady
beltham
ears
when
the
silbertown
came
bursting
into
the
room
with
radiant
face
and
shining
eyes
and
smiling
lips
and
hurried
to
his
mistress
i
thought
as
much
he
exclaimed
excitedly
it
was
the
villain
all
right
i
recognised
him
from
the
description
in
spite
of
his
beard
i
informed
the
police
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
have
been
watching
for
the
last
two
days
just
fancy
your
ladyship
a
detective
was
shadowing
gurn
and
when
he
was
going
out
of
the
house
i
gave
him
the
signal
lady
beltham
stared
at
the
in
mute
horror
yes
she
muttered
on
the
point
of
swooning
i
pointed
him
out
to
the
police
and
it
thanks
to
me
your
ladyship
that
gurn
the
murderer
has
been
arrested
at
last
for
just
another
moment
lady
beltham
stared
at
the
man
who
gave
her
these
appalling
tidings
seemed
to
strive
to
utter
something
then
fell
prone
to
the
floor
unconscious
the
and
the
girls
sprang
to
her
side
to
lavish
attentions
upon
her
at
that
moment
the
door
was
pushed
a
little
way
open
and
the
figure
of
juve
appeared
may
i
come
in
said
he
xxii
the
scrap
of
paper
it
was
three
when
juve
arrived
at
the
rue
lévert
and
he
found
the
concierge
of
number
just
finishing
her
coffee
amazed
at
the
results
achieved
by
the
detective
the
details
of
which
she
had
learned
from
the
sensational
articles
in
the
daily
paper
she
most
affected
mme
doulenques
had
conceived
a
most
respectful
admiration
for
the
inspector
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
that
man
she
constantly
declared
to
madame
aurore
it
is
eyes
he
has
in
his
head
it
telescopes
magnifying
glasses
he
sees
everything
in
a
minute
even
when
it
is
there
she
gave
him
an
admiring
good
afternoon
inspector
as
he
came
into
her
lodge
and
going
to
a
board
on
which
numbers
of
keys
were
hanging
took
one
down
and
handed
it
to
him
so
there
something
fresh
she
said
i
just
seen
in
the
paper
that
gurn
has
been
arrested
so
it
was
my
lodger
who
did
it
what
a
dreadful
man
whoever
would
have
thought
it
it
turns
my
blood
cold
to
think
of
him
juve
was
never
a
man
for
general
conversation
and
he
was
still
less
interested
in
the
garrulity
of
this
loquacious
creature
he
took
the
key
and
cut
short
her
remarks
by
walking
to
the
door
yes
gurn
has
been
arrested
he
said
shortly
but
he
has
made
no
confession
so
nothing
is
known
for
certain
yet
please
go
on
with
your
work
exactly
as
though
i
were
not
in
the
house
mme
doulenques
it
was
his
usual
phrase
and
a
constant
disappointment
to
the
concierge
who
would
have
asked
nothing
better
than
to
go
upstairs
with
the
detective
and
watch
him
at
his
wonderful
work
juve
went
up
the
five
floors
to
the
flat
formerly
occupied
by
gurn
reflecting
somewhat
moodily
of
course
gurn
arrest
was
a
success
and
it
was
satisfactory
to
have
the
scoundrel
under
lock
and
key
but
in
point
of
fact
juve
had
learned
nothing
new
in
consequence
of
the
arrest
and
he
was
obsessed
with
the
idea
that
this
murder
of
lord
beltham
was
an
altogether
exceptional
crime
he
did
not
yet
know
why
gurn
had
killed
lord
beltham
and
he
did
not
even
know
exactly
who
gurn
himself
was
all
he
could
declare
was
that
the
murder
had
been
planned
and
carried
out
with
marvellous
audacity
and
skill
and
that
was
not
enough
juve
let
himself
into
the
flat
and
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
him
the
rooms
were
in
disorder
the
result
of
the
searches
effected
by
the
police
the
rent
had
not
been
paid
for
some
time
and
as
no
friend
or
relation
had
come
forward
to
assume
control
of
gurn
interests
the
furniture
and
ornaments
of
the
little
flat
were
to
be
sold
by
auction
the
detective
walked
through
the
rooms
then
flung
himself
into
an
he
did
not
know
precisely
why
he
had
come
he
had
searched
the
place
a
dozen
times
already
since
his
discovery
of
the
corpse
within
the
trunk
and
had
found
nothing
more
no
marks
or
fresh
detail
to
assist
in
the
elucidation
of
the
mystery
he
would
have
given
very
much
to
be
able
to
identify
gurn
with
some
other
of
the
many
criminals
who
had
passed
through
his
hands
and
still
more
to
be
able
to
identify
him
with
that
one
most
mysterious
criminal
whose
fearful
deeds
had
shocked
the
world
so
greatly
somehow
the
particular
way
in
which
this
murder
was
committed
the
very
audacity
of
it
led
him
to
think
to
sense
almost
to
swear
that
juve
got
up
it
was
little
in
accord
with
his
active
temperament
to
sit
still
once
more
he
went
all
round
the
flat
the
kitchen
let
me
see
i
have
been
through
everything
the
stove
the
cupboards
the
saucepans
why
i
went
so
far
as
to
make
sure
that
there
was
no
poison
in
them
though
it
seemed
a
wild
idea
the
anteroom
nothing
there
the
umbrella
stand
was
empty
and
the
one
interesting
thing
i
did
see
the
torn
curtain
has
been
described
and
photographed
officially
he
went
back
into
the
i
searched
all
the
furniture
and
i
went
through
all
the
parcels
gurn
had
done
up
before
he
left
and
would
no
doubt
have
come
back
for
at
his
leisure
had
it
not
been
for
my
discovery
of
the
body
and
the
unfortunate
publicity
the
newspapers
gave
to
that
fact
in
one
corner
of
the
room
was
a
heap
of
old
newspapers
crumpled
and
torn
and
thrown
down
in
disorder
juve
kicked
them
aside
i
looked
through
all
that
even
read
the
agony
columns
but
there
was
nothing
there
he
went
into
the
bedroom
and
contemplated
the
bed
that
the
concierge
had
stripped
the
chairs
set
one
on
top
of
another
in
a
corner
and
the
wardrobe
that
stood
empty
its
former
contents
scattered
on
the
floor
by
the
police
during
their
search
there
too
nothing
was
to
be
found
against
the
wall
near
the
fireplace
was
a
little
escritoire
with
a
cupboard
above
it
containing
a
few
battered
books
my
men
have
been
all
through
that
juve
muttered
it
most
unlikely
that
they
missed
anything
but
perhaps
i
had
better
see
he
sat
down
before
it
and
began
methodically
to
sort
the
scattered
papers
with
quick
trained
glance
he
scanned
each
document
putting
one
after
another
aside
with
a
grimace
expressive
of
disappointment
almost
the
last
document
he
picked
up
was
a
long
sheet
of
parchment
and
as
he
unfolded
it
an
exclamation
escaped
his
lips
it
was
an
official
notice
of
gurn
promotion
to
the
rank
of
sergeant
when
fighting
under
lord
beltham
in
the
south
african
war
juve
read
it
through
he
knew
english
well
and
laid
it
down
with
a
gesture
of
discouragement
it
is
extraordinary
he
muttered
that
seems
to
be
perfectly
authentic
it
is
authentic
and
it
proves
that
this
fellow
was
a
decent
fellow
and
a
brave
soldier
once
that
is
a
fine
record
of
service
he
drummed
his
fingers
on
the
desk
and
spoke
aloud
is
gurn
really
gurn
then
and
have
i
been
mistaken
from
start
to
finish
in
the
little
romance
i
have
been
weaving
round
him
how
am
i
to
find
the
key
to
the
mystery
how
am
i
to
prove
the
truth
of
what
i
feel
to
be
so
very
close
to
me
but
which
eludes
me
every
time
just
as
i
seem
to
be
about
to
grasp
it
he
went
on
with
his
search
and
then
looking
at
the
bookcase
took
the
volumes
out
and
holding
each
by
its
two
covers
shook
it
to
make
sure
that
no
papers
were
hidden
among
the
leaves
but
all
in
vain
he
did
the
same
with
a
large
railway
and
several
shipping
calendars
the
odd
thing
is
he
thought
that
all
these
go
to
prove
that
gurn
really
was
the
commercial
traveller
he
professed
to
be
exactly
things
such
as
these
one
would
expect
to
find
in
the
possession
of
a
man
who
travelled
much
and
always
had
to
be
referring
to
the
dates
of
sailing
to
distant
parts
of
the
world
in
the
bookcase
was
a
box
made
to
represent
a
bound
book
and
containing
a
collection
of
ordnance
maps
juve
took
them
out
to
make
sure
that
no
loose
papers
were
included
among
them
and
one
by
one
unfolded
every
map
then
a
sharp
exclamation
burst
from
his
lips
good
lord
now
there
in
his
surprise
he
sprang
up
so
abruptly
that
he
pushed
back
his
chair
and
overturned
it
his
excitement
was
so
great
that
his
hands
were
shaking
as
he
carefully
spread
out
upon
the
desk
one
of
the
ordnance
maps
he
had
taken
from
the
case
it
the
map
of
the
centre
district
all
right
the
map
which
shows
cahors
and
brives
and
and
beaulieu
and
the
missing
piece
it
is
the
missing
piece
that
would
give
that
precise
district
juve
stared
at
the
map
with
hypnotised
gaze
for
a
piece
had
been
cut
out
of
it
cut
out
with
a
penknife
neatly
and
carefully
and
that
piece
must
have
shown
the
exact
district
where
the
château
stood
which
had
been
occupied
by
the
marquise
de
langrune
oh
if
i
could
only
prove
it
prove
that
the
piece
missing
from
this
map
this
map
belonging
to
gurn
is
really
and
truly
the
piece
i
found
near
verrières
station
just
after
the
murder
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
what
a
triumph
that
would
be
what
a
damning
proof
what
astounding
consequences
this
discovery
of
mine
might
have
juve
made
a
careful
note
of
the
number
of
the
map
quickly
and
nervously
folded
it
up
again
and
prepared
to
leave
the
flat
he
had
made
but
a
step
or
two
towards
the
door
when
a
sharp
ring
at
the
bell
made
him
jump
the
deuce
he
exclaimed
softly
who
can
be
coming
to
ring
gurn
up
when
everybody
in
paris
knows
he
has
been
arrested
and
he
felt
mechanically
in
his
pocket
to
make
sure
that
his
revolver
was
there
then
he
smiled
what
a
fool
i
am
of
course
it
is
only
mme
doulenques
wondering
why
i
am
staying
here
so
long
he
strode
to
the
door
flung
it
wide
open
and
then
recoiled
in
astonishment
you
he
exclaimed
surveying
the
caller
from
top
to
toe
you
charles
rambert
or
i
should
say
jérôme
fandor
now
what
the
deuce
does
this
mean
xxiii
the
wreck
of
the
lancaster
jérôme
fandor
entered
the
room
without
a
word
juve
closed
the
door
behind
him
the
boy
was
very
pale
and
manifestly
much
upset
what
is
the
matter
said
juve
something
terrible
has
happened
the
boy
answered
i
have
just
heard
awful
news
my
poor
father
is
dead
what
juve
exclaimed
sharply
etienne
rambert
dead
jérôme
fandor
put
a
newspaper
into
the
detective
hand
read
that
he
said
and
pointed
to
an
article
on
the
front
page
with
a
huge
of
the
lives
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
and
he
had
such
obvious
difficulty
in
restraining
his
grief
that
juve
saw
that
to
read
the
article
would
be
the
speediest
way
to
find
out
what
had
occurred
the
red
star
liner
plying
between
caracas
and
southampton
had
gone
down
with
all
hands
the
night
before
just
off
the
isle
of
wight
and
at
the
moment
of
going
to
press
only
one
person
was
known
to
have
been
saved
there
was
a
good
sea
running
but
it
was
by
no
means
rough
and
the
vessel
was
still
within
sight
of
the
lighthouse
and
making
for
the
open
sea
at
full
speed
when
the
lighthousemen
suddenly
saw
her
literally
blown
into
the
air
and
then
disappear
beneath
the
waves
the
alarm
was
given
immediately
and
boats
of
all
kinds
put
off
to
the
scene
of
the
disaster
but
though
a
great
deal
of
wreckage
was
still
floating
about
only
one
man
of
the
crew
was
seen
clinging
to
a
spar
he
was
picked
up
by
the
and
taken
to
hospital
where
he
was
interviewed
by
without
however
being
able
to
throw
any
light
upon
what
was
an
almost
unprecedented
catastrophe
in
the
history
of
the
sea
all
he
could
say
was
that
the
liner
had
just
got
up
full
speed
and
was
making
a
perfectly
normal
beginning
of
her
trip
when
suddenly
a
tremendous
explosion
occurred
he
himself
was
engaged
at
the
moment
fastening
the
tarpaulins
over
the
baggage
hold
and
he
was
confident
that
the
explosion
occurred
among
the
cargo
but
he
could
give
absolutely
no
more
information
the
entire
ship
seemed
to
be
riven
asunder
and
he
was
thrown
into
the
sea
stunned
and
knew
no
more
until
he
recovered
consciousness
and
found
himself
aboard
the
it
quite
incomprehensible
juve
muttered
surely
there
ca
have
been
any
powder
aboard
no
explosives
are
carried
on
these
great
liners
they
only
take
passengers
and
the
mails
he
scanned
the
list
of
passengers
etienne
rambert
name
is
given
among
the
passengers
right
enough
he
said
well
it
odd
jérôme
fandor
heaved
a
profound
sigh
it
is
a
fatality
which
i
shall
never
get
over
he
said
when
you
told
me
the
other
day
that
you
knew
i
was
innocent
i
ought
to
have
gone
to
see
my
father
in
spite
of
what
you
said
i
am
sure
he
would
have
believed
me
and
come
to
see
you
then
you
could
have
convinced
him
and
i
should
not
have
this
horrible
grief
of
remembering
that
he
had
died
without
learning
that
his
son
was
not
a
bad
man
but
was
quite
deserving
of
his
affection
jérôme
fandor
was
making
a
brave
struggle
to
maintain
his
and
juve
looked
at
him
without
concealing
the
real
sympathy
he
felt
for
him
in
his
grief
he
put
his
hand
kindly
on
his
shoulder
listen
my
dear
boy
odd
as
you
may
think
it
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
that
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
despair
there
is
nothing
to
prove
that
your
father
is
dead
he
may
not
have
been
on
board
the
boy
looked
up
in
surprise
what
do
you
mean
juve
i
do
want
to
say
anything
my
boy
except
that
you
would
be
very
wrong
to
give
way
to
distress
at
present
if
you
have
any
confidence
in
me
you
may
believe
me
when
i
say
that
there
is
nothing
yet
to
prove
that
you
have
had
this
loss
and
besides
you
still
have
your
mother
who
is
perfectly
sure
to
get
quite
well
do
you
understand
sure
he
changed
the
subject
abruptly
there
is
one
thing
i
should
like
to
know
what
the
dickens
brought
you
here
you
were
the
first
person
i
thought
of
in
my
trouble
fandor
replied
directly
i
read
about
the
disaster
in
that
paper
i
came
to
tell
you
at
once
yes
i
quite
understand
that
juve
answered
what
i
do
not
understand
is
how
you
guessed
that
you
would
find
me
here
in
gurn
flat
the
question
seemed
to
perturb
the
boy
it
it
was
quite
by
chance
he
stammered
that
is
the
kind
of
explanation
one
offers
to
fools
juve
retorted
by
what
chance
did
you
see
me
come
into
this
house
what
the
deuce
were
you
doing
in
the
rue
lévert
the
lad
showed
some
inclination
to
make
for
the
door
but
juve
stayed
him
peremptorily
answer
my
question
please
how
did
you
know
i
was
here
driven
into
a
corner
the
boy
blurted
out
the
truth
i
had
followed
you
followed
me
juve
exclaimed
where
from
from
your
rooms
you
mean
and
you
may
as
well
own
up
to
it
at
once
that
you
were
shadowing
me
well
yes
juve
it
is
true
fandor
confessed
all
in
one
breath
i
was
shadowing
you
i
do
every
day
juve
was
dumbfounded
every
day
and
i
never
saw
you
gad
you
are
jolly
clever
and
may
i
enquire
why
you
have
been
exercising
this
supervision
over
me
jérôme
fandor
hung
his
head
forgive
me
he
faltered
i
have
been
very
stupid
i
thought
you
i
thought
you
were
fantômas
the
idea
tickled
the
detective
so
much
that
he
dropped
back
into
a
chair
to
laugh
at
his
ease
my
word
he
said
you
have
an
imagination
and
what
made
you
suppose
that
i
was
fantômas
juve
fandor
said
earnestly
i
made
a
vow
that
i
would
find
out
the
truth
and
discover
the
scoundrel
who
has
made
such
awful
havoc
of
my
life
but
i
did
not
know
where
to
begin
from
all
you
have
said
i
realised
that
fantômas
was
a
most
extraordinarily
clever
man
i
did
not
know
anyone
who
could
be
cleverer
than
you
and
so
i
watched
you
it
was
merely
logical
far
from
being
angry
juve
was
rather
flattered
i
am
amazed
by
what
you
have
just
told
me
my
boy
he
said
with
a
smile
in
the
first
place
your
reasoning
is
not
at
all
bad
of
course
it
is
obvious
that
i
can
not
suspect
myself
of
being
fantômas
but
i
quite
admit
that
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
might
make
the
supposition
wild
as
it
may
seem
and
in
the
next
place
you
have
shadowed
me
without
my
becoming
aware
of
the
fact
and
that
is
very
good
indeed
a
proof
that
you
are
uncommonly
smart
he
looked
at
the
lad
attentively
for
a
few
moments
and
then
went
on
more
gravely
are
you
satisfied
now
that
your
hypothesis
was
wrong
or
do
you
still
suspect
me
no
i
do
suspect
you
now
fandor
declared
not
since
i
saw
you
come
into
this
house
fantômas
certainly
would
not
have
come
to
search
gurn
rooms
because
he
stopped
and
juve
who
was
looking
at
him
keenly
did
not
make
him
finish
what
he
was
saying
shall
i
tell
you
something
he
said
at
last
if
you
continue
to
display
as
much
thought
and
initiative
in
the
career
you
have
chosen
as
you
have
just
displayed
you
will
very
soon
be
the
first
newspaper
detective
of
the
day
he
jumped
up
and
led
the
boy
off
come
along
i
got
to
go
to
the
law
courts
at
once
you
found
out
something
fresh
i
going
to
ask
them
to
call
an
interesting
witness
in
the
gurn
affair
rain
had
been
falling
heavily
all
the
morning
and
afternoon
but
within
the
last
few
minutes
it
had
almost
stopped
dollon
the
steward
put
his
hand
out
of
the
window
and
found
that
only
a
few
drops
were
falling
now
from
the
heavy
grey
sky
he
was
an
invaluable
servant
and
a
few
months
after
the
death
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
the
baronne
de
vibray
had
gladly
offered
him
a
situation
and
a
cottage
on
her
estate
at
querelles
he
walked
across
the
room
and
called
his
son
jacques
would
you
like
to
come
with
me
i
am
going
down
to
the
river
to
see
that
the
sluices
have
been
opened
properly
the
banks
are
anything
but
sound
and
these
rains
will
flood
us
out
one
of
these
days
the
steward
and
his
son
went
down
the
garden
towards
the
stream
which
formed
one
boundary
of
mme
de
vibray
park
look
father
jacques
exclaimed
the
postman
is
calling
us
the
postman
a
crusty
but
fellow
came
hurrying
up
to
the
steward
you
do
make
me
run
dollon
he
complained
i
went
to
your
house
this
morning
to
take
you
a
letter
but
you
were
there
you
might
have
left
it
with
anybody
excuse
me
the
man
retorted
it
against
the
regulations
i
got
an
official
letter
for
you
and
i
can
only
give
it
to
you
yourself
and
he
held
out
an
envelope
which
dollon
tore
open
magistrates
office
he
said
enquiringly
as
he
glanced
at
the
heading
of
the
notepaper
who
can
be
writing
to
me
from
the
law
courts
he
read
the
letter
aloud
sir
as
time
does
not
permit
of
a
regular
summons
being
sent
to
you
by
an
usher
of
the
court
i
beg
you
to
be
so
good
as
to
come
to
paris

the
day
after
if
possible
and
attend
at
my
office
where
your
depositions
are
absolutely
required
to
conclude
a
case
in
which
you
are
interested
please
bring
without
exception
all
the
papers
and
documents
entrusted
to
you
by
the
clerk
of

at
cahors
at
the
conclusion
of
the
langrune
enquiry

is
signed
germain
fuselier
dollon
remarked
i
often
seen
his
name
in
the
papers
he
is
a
very
magistrate
and
is
employed
in
many
criminal
cases
he
read
the
letter
through
once
more
and
turned
to
the
postman
will
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
muller
that
a
thing
i
never
say
to
well
go
into
the
house
with
jacques
and
while
he
is
attending
to
you
i
will
write
a
reply
telegram
which
you
can
take
to
the
office
for
me
while
the
man
was
quenching
his
thirst

wrote
his
reply

leave
verrières
evening
by
train
arriving
paris
wire
appointment
at
your
office
to
me
at
hôtel
rue
du
bac
he
read
the
message
over
signed
it
dollon
and
considered
i
wonder
what
they
can
want
me
for
oh
if
only
they
have
found
out
something
about
the
langrune
affair
how
glad
i
shall
be
xxiv
under
lock
and
key
after
the
preliminary
examination
as
to
his
identity
and
so
on
gurn
had
been
transferred
to
the
santé
prison
at
first
the
prisoner
seemed
to
have
terrible
difficulty
in
accustoming
himself
to
the
rigours
of
confinement
he
suffered
from
alternate
paroxysms
of
rage
and
despair
but
by
sheer
strength
of
character
he
fought
these
down
as
a
prisoner
on
remand
he
was
entitled
to
the
privilege
of
a
separate
cell
also
during
the
first
hours
he
had
been
able
to
have
his
meals
sent
in
from
outside
since
then
however
his
money
had
given
out
and
he
was
obliged
to
content
himself
with
the
ordinary
prison
dietary
but
gurn
was
not
fastidious
this
man
whom
lady
beltham
had
singled
out
or
accepted
as
her
lover
had
often
given
proofs
of
an
education
and
an
intelligence
above
the
average
yet
now
he
appeared
quite
at
ease
in
the
atmosphere
of
a
prison
gurn
was
walking
quickly
and
alone
round
the
exercise
yard
when
a
breathless
voice
sounded
in
his
ear
gurn
you
know
how
to
march
i
was
going
to
join
you
for
a
bit
but
i
could
not
keep
up
with
you
gurn
turned
and
saw
old
siegenthal
the
warder
in
charge
of
his
division
in
whose
custody
he
was
particularly
placed
my
word
the
old
fellow
panted
anybody
could
tell
you
had
been
in
the
infantry
well
so
have
i
though
that
was
yesterday
nor
yet
the
day
before
but
we
never
marched
as
fast
as
you
do
we
made
a
fine
march
once
though
at
out
of
pity
for
the
decent
old
fellow
gurn
slackened
his
pace
he
had
heard
the
story
of
the
battle
of
a
dozen
times
already
but
he
was
quite
willing
to
let
siegenthal
tell
it
again
the
warder
however
wandered
to
another
point
by
the
way
i
heard
you
were
promoted
sergeant
out
in
the
transvaal
is
that
so
and
as
gurn
nodded
assent
he
went
on
i
never
rose
above
the
rank
of
corporal
but
at
any
rate
i
have
always
led
an
honest
life
a
sudden
compassion
for
his
prisoner
seized
the
old
man
and
he
laid
a
kindly
hand
on
gurn
shoulder
is
it
really
possible
that
an
old
soldier
like
you
who
seem
to
be
such
a
steady
serious
kind
of
man
can
have
committed
such
a
crime
gurn
dropped
his
eyes
and
did
not
reply
i
suppose
there
was
a
woman
at
the
bottom
of
it
siegenthal
said
tentatively
you
acted
on
impulse
in
a
fit
of
jealousy
eh
no
gurn
answered
with
sudden
bluntness
i
may
as
well
own
up
that
i
did
it
in
anger
because
i
wanted
money
for
the
sake
of
robbery
i
sorry
said
the
old
warder
simply
you
must
have
been
desperately
hard
up
no
i
was
siegenthal
stared
at
his
prisoner
the
man
must
be
utterly
callous
to
talk
like
that
he
thought
then
a
clock
struck
and
the
warder
gave
a
curt
order
time
gurn
we
must
go
back
and
he
conducted
the
unresisting
prisoner
up
the
three
flights
of
stairs
that
led
to
the
division
in
which
his
cell
was
by
the
way
he
remarked
as
they
went
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
you
and
i
have
got
to
part
oh
said
gurn
am
i
to
be
transferred
to
another
prison
no
it
i
who
am
going
just
fancy
i
have
been
appointed
head
warder
at
poissy
i
go
on
leave
and
take
up
my
new
post
in
a
week
both
halted
before
the
door
of
cell
number
in
with
you
said
siegenthal
and
when
gurn
had
obeyed
he
turned
to
go
then
he
wheeled
round
again
quickly
and
put
out
his
hand
hurriedly
as
if
half
afraid
of
being
seen
put
it
there
gurn
he
said
no
doubt
you
are
a
murderer
and
as
you
have
confessed
yourself
a
thief
but
i
forget
that
if
you
had
kept
straight
you
were
the
sergeant
and
i
should
have
had
to
obey
you
i
sorry
for
you
gurn
was
touched
and
murmured
a
word
of
thanks
that
all
right
that
all
right
siegenthal
muttered
not
attempting
to
hide
his
emotion
let
us
hope
that
everything
will
turn
out
well
and
he
left
gurn
alone
in
the
cell
to
his
meditations
twice
gurn
reflected
relying
on
the
sympathy
which
he
knew
he
had
evoked
in
the
old
warder
heart
despite
the
number
of
criminals
who
had
passed
through
his
hands
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
broaching
a
serious
and
delicate
matter
to
him
but
he
had
not
actually
spoken
being
deterred
by
some
undefinable
scruple
as
well
as
half
suspecting
that
his
application
would
be
made
in
vain
and
now
he
was
glad
he
had
been
so
cautious
for
even
if
the
warder
had
been
amenable
his
approaching
removal
to
another
prison
would
have
prevented
the
idea
from
coming
to
fruition
a
voice
echoed
in
the
corridor
number
you
are
wanted
in
the
barristers
room
get
ready
and
the
next
minute
the
door
of
the
cell
was
thrown
open
and
a
warder
with
a
strong
gascon
accent
appeared
gurn
had
noticed
him
before
he
was
the
second
warder
in
this
division
a
man
named
nibet
and
no
doubt
he
would
be
promoted
to
siegenthal
place
when
the
chief
warder
left
nibet
looked
curiously
at
gurn
a
certain
sympathy
in
his
quick
brown
eyes
ready
gurn
gurn
growled
an
answer
and
pulled
on
his
coat
again
his
counsel
was
maître
barberoux
one
of
the
foremost
criminal
barristers
of
the
day
gurn
had
thought
it
prudent
to
retain
him
for
his
defence
more
especially
as
it
would
cost
him
nothing
personally
but
he
had
no
particular
desire
to
talk
to
him
now
he
had
already
told
him
everything
he
intended
to
tell
him
and
he
had
no
intention
of
allowing
the
case
to
be
boomed
as
a
sensation
quite
the
reverse
indeed
in
his
opinion
the
flatter
the
case
fell
the
better
it
would
be
for
his
interests
though
no
doubt
maître
barberoux
would
not
be
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
but
he
said
nothing
and
merely
walked
in
front
of
nibet
along
the
corridor
towards
the
barristers
room
the
way
to
which
he
was
already
familiar
with
on
the
way
they
passed
some
masons
who
were
at
work
in
the
prison
and
these
men
stopped
to
watch
him
pass
but
contrary
to
gurn
apprehensions
they
did
not
seem
to
recognise
him
he
hoped
it
meant
that
the
murder
was
already
ceasing
to
be
a
nine
days
wonder
for
the
public
at
large
nibet
pushed
gurn
into
the
barristers
room
saying
respectfully
to
the
person
in
it
already
you
only
have
to
ring
sir
when
you
have
finished
and
then
withdrew
leaving
gurn
in
presence
not
of
his
counsel
as
he
had
expected
but
of
that
personage
assistant
a
young
licentiate
in
law
named
roger
de
seras
who
was
also
a
most
incredible
dandy
roger
de
seras
greeted
gurn
with
an
engaging
smile
and
advanced
as
if
to
shake
hands
with
him
but
suddenly
wondering
whether
that
action
might
not
suggest
undue
familiarity
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
own
head
instead
and
scratched
it
the
young
fellow
was
still
younger
in
his
business
and
did
not
rightly
know
whether
it
was
etiquette
for
a
barrister
or
even
a
barrister
junior
to
shake
hands
with
a
prisoner
who
was
implicated
in
a
notorious
murder
gurn
felt
inclined
to
laugh
and
on
the
whole
was
glad
that
it
was
the
junior
whom
he
had
to
see
the
futile
verbosity
of
this
very
young
licentiate
might
possibly
be
amusing
maître
roger
de
seras
began
with
civil
apologies
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
only
stay
for
a
few
minutes
but
i
am
most
frightfully
busy
besides
two
ladies
are
waiting
for
me
outside
in
my
carriage
i
may
say
confidentially
that
they
are
actresses
old
friends
of
mine
and
just
fancy
they
are
most
frightfully
anxious
to
see
you
that
what
it
means
to
be
famous
gurn
eh
what
gurn
nodded
not
feeling
unduly
flattered
roger
de
seras
continued
just
to
please
them
i
have
made
any
number
of
applications
to
the
governor
of
the
prison
but
there
was
nothing
doing
my
dear
chap
that
beast
of
a
magistrate
fuselier
insists
on
your
being
kept
in
absolute
seclusion
but
none
the
less
i
got
some
news
for
you
i
know
heaps
why
my
friends
at
the
law
courts
call
me
peripatetic
paragraph
not
bad
eh
what
gurn
smiled
and
roger
de
seras
was
encouraged
it
given
me
no
end
of
a
boom
my
leader
acting
for
you
and
my
being
able
to
come
and
see
you
whenever
i
like
everybody
asks
me
how
you
are
and
what
you
are
like
and
what
you
say
and
what
you
think
you
can
congratulate
yourself
on
having
caused
a
sensation
in
paris
gurn
began
to
be
irritated
by
all
this
chatter
i
must
confess
i
not
the
least
interested
in
what
people
are
saying
about
me
is
there
anything
new
in
my
case
absolutely
nothing
that
i
am
aware
of
roger
de
seras
replied
serenely
without
stopping
to
think
whether
there
was
or
not
i
say
lady
beltham
yes
said
gurn
well
i
know
her
very
well
you
know
i
go
out
a
frightful
lot
and
i
have
often
met
her
a
charming
woman
lady
beltham
gurn
really
did
not
know
how
to
treat
the
idiot
never
one
to
suffer
fools
gladly
he
grew
irritable
and
would
almost
certainly
have
said
something
that
would
have
put
the
garrulous
young
bungler
in
his
place
had
not
the
latter
suddenly
remembered
something
just
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
getting
up
to
go
oh
by
the
way
he
said
with
a
laugh
i
was
nearly
forgetting
the
most
important
thing
of
all
just
fancy
that
beast
juve
the
marvellous
detective
whom
the
newspapers
rave
about
went
to
your
place
yesterday
afternoon
to
make
another
official
search
alone
enquired
gurn
much
interested
quite
alone
now
what
do
you
suppose
he
found
the
place
has
been
ransacked
dozens
of
times
you
know
of
course
i
mean
something
sensational
in
the
way
of
a
find
i
bet
you
a
thousand
i
never
bet
gurn
snapped
tell
me
at
once
what
it
was
the
young
fellow
was
proud
of
having
caught
the
attention
of
his
leader
notorious
client
if
only
for
a
moment
he
paused
and
wagged
his
head
weighing
each
word
to
give
them
greater
emphasis
he
found
an
ordnance
map
in
your
bookcase
my
dear
chap
an
ordnance
map
with
a
bit
torn
out
of
it
oh
and
what
then
said
gurn
a
frown
upon
his
face
the
young
barrister
did
not
notice
the
expression
on
the
countenance
well
then
it
appears
that
juve
thought
it
was
very
important
between
you
and
me
my
opinion
is
that
juve
tries
to
be
frightfully
clever
and
succeeds
in
looking
a
fool
how
i
ask
you
can
the
discovery
of
that
map
affect
your
case
or
influence
the
decision
of
the
jury
by
the
way
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
worry
about
the
result
i
have
had
a
frightful
lot
of
experience
in
criminal
cases
and
so
be
assured
you
are
all
right
extenuating
circumstances
you
know
but
oh
yes
there
is
one
thing
more
i
wanted
to
tell
you
a
fresh
witness
is
going
to
be
called
at
the
examination
let
me
see
what
his
name
dollon
it
the
steward
dollon
i
do
understand
said
gurn
his
head
was
bent
and
his
eyes
cast
down
a
glimmer
of
light
dawned
in
the
young
licentiate
brain
wait
there
is
some
connection
he
said
the
steward
dollon
is
in
the
employment
of
a
lady
who
calls
herself
the
baronne
de
vibray
and
the
baronne
de
vibray
is
guardian
to
the
young
lady
who
was
staying
with
lady
beltham
the
day
or
rather
the
night
when
you
you
well
you
know
and
that
young
lady
mlle
thérèse
auvernois
was
placed
with
lady
beltham
by
etienne
rambert
and
etienne
rambert
is
the
father
of
the
young
man
who
murdered
the
marquise
de
langrune
last
year
i
tell
you
all
these
things
without
attempting
to
draw
any
deductions
from
them
for
for
my
own
part
i
have
the
least
idea
why
the
steward
dollon
has
been
summoned
in
our
case
at
all
nor
have
i
said
gurn
and
the
frown
on
his
brow
was
deeper
roger
de
seras
hunted
all
round
the
little
room
for
his
gloves
and
found
them
in
his
pocket
well
my
dear
chap
i
must
leave
you
we
have
been
chatting
for
a
whole
and
those
ladies
are
still
waiting
for
me
what
on
earth
will
they
say
to
me
he
was
about
to
ring
for
the
warder
when
gurn
abruptly
stayed
him
tell
me
he
said
with
a
sudden
air
of
interest
when
is
that
man
coming
what
his
name
dollon
the
young
barrister
was
on
the
point
of
saying
he
did
not
know
when
a
brilliant
recollection
came
into
his
mind
how
frightfully
stupid
i
am
why
i
have
a
copy
of
the
telegram
he
sent
the
magistrate
in
my
portfolio
here
now
he
opened
the
portfolio
and
picked
out
a
sheet
of
blue
paper
here
it
is
gurn
took
it
from
him
and
read
will
leave
verrières
evening
by
train
arriving
paris
gurn
appeared
to
be
sufficiently
edified
at
all
events
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
rest
of
the
message
lord
beltham
murderer
handed
the
document
back
to
the
barrister
without
a
word
a
few
minutes
later
maître
roger
de
seras
had
rejoined
his
lady
friends
and
the
prisoner
was
once
more
in
his
cell
xxv
an
unexpected
accomplice
gurn
was
walking
nervously
up
and
down
in
his
cell
after
this
interview
when
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
the
cheery
face
of
the
warder
nibet
looked
in
evening
gurn
he
said
it
six
and
the
opposite
wants
to
know
if
he
is
to
send
your
dinner
in
to
you
no
gurn
growled
i
have
the
prison
ordinary
oh
ho
said
the
warder
funds
low
eh
of
course
it
not
for
you
to
despise
our
dietary
but
still
government
beans
he
came
further
into
the
cell
ignoring
gurn
impatient
preference
for
his
room
to
his
company
and
said
in
a
low
tone
there
take
that
and
thrust
a
into
the
hand
of
the
dumbfounded
prisoner
and
if
you
want
any
more
they
will
be
forthcoming
he
added
he
made
a
sign
to
gurn
to
say
nothing
and
went
to
the
door
i
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
just
go
and
order
a
decent
dinner
for
you
gurn
felt
as
if
a
tremendous
weight
had
been
lifted
from
him
the
cell
seemed
larger
the
prison
walls
less
high
he
had
an
intuition
that
lady
beltham
was
not
deserting
him
he
had
never
doubted
the
sincerity
of
her
feelings
for
him
but
he
quite
realised
how
a
woman
in
her
delicate
position
might
feel
embarrassed
in
trying
to
intervene
in
favour
of
any
prisoner
and
much
more
so
in
the
case
of
the
one
whom
the
entire
world
believed
to
be
the
murderer
of
her
husband
but
now
lady
beltham
had
intervened
she
had
succeeded
in
communicating
with
him
through
the
medium
of
this
warder
and
almost
certainly
she
would
do
much
more
yet
the
door
opened
again
and
the
warder
entered
carrying
a
long
rush
basket
containing
several
dishes
and
a
bottle
of
wine
well
gurn
that
a
more
agreeable
sort
of
dinner
eh
gad
i
wanted
it
after
all
said
the
murderer
with
a
smile
it
was
a
good
idea
of
yours
nibet
to
insist
on
my
getting
my
dinner
sent
in
from
outside
nibet
winked
he
appreciated
his
prisoner
tact
obviously
he
was
not
one
to
make
untimely
allusions
to
the
warder
breach
of
discipline
in
conveying
money
to
him
so
simply
but
so
very
irregularly
as
he
ate
gurn
chatted
with
nibet
i
suppose
it
is
you
who
will
get
siegenthal
place
yes
said
nibet
sipping
the
wine
gurn
had
offered
him
i
have
asked
for
the
berth
no
end
of
times
but
it
never
came
i
was
always
told
to
wait
because
the
place
was
not
free
and
another
berth
must
be
found
first
for
siegenthal
who
was
my
senior
but
the
old
beast
would
never
make
any
application
however
three
days
ago
i
was
sent
for
to
the
ministry
and
one
of
the
staff
told
me
that
some
one
in
the
embassy
or
the
government
or
somewhere
was
taking
an
interest
in
me
and
they
asked
me
a
lot
of
questions
and
i
told
them
all
about
it
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
siegenthal
was
promoted
to
poissy
and
i
was
given
his
billet
here
gurn
nodded
he
saw
light
and
what
about
the
money
that
stranger
still
but
i
understood
all
the
same
a
lady
met
me
in
the
street
the
other
night
and
spoke
to
me
by
name
we
had
a
chat
there
on
the
pavement
for
the
street
was
empty
and
she
shoved
some
in
my
hand
not
just
one
or
two
but
a
great
bunch
and
she
told
me
that
she
was
interested
in
me
in
you
and
that
if
things
turned
out
as
she
wished
there
were
plenty
more
where
those
came
from
while
the
warder
was
talking
gurn
watched
him
carefully
the
murderer
was
an
experienced
reader
of
character
in
faces
and
he
speedily
realised
that
his
lady
choice
had
fallen
on
an
excellent
object
thick
lips
a
narrow
forehead
and
prominent
suggested
a
material
nature
that
would
hesitate
at
nothing
which
would
satisfy
his
carnal
appetites
so
gurn
decided
that
further
circumlocution
was
so
much
waste
of
time
and
that
he
might
safely
come
to
the
point
he
laid
his
hand
familiarly
on
the
warder
shoulder
i
getting
sick
of
being
here
he
remarked
i
dare
say
the
warder
answered
uneasily
but
you
must
be
guided
by
reason
time
is
going
on
and
things
arrange
themselves
they
do
when
you
help
them
gurn
said
peremptorily
and
you
and
i
are
going
to
help
them
that
remains
to
be
seen
said
the
warder
of
course
everything
has
got
to
be
paid
for
gurn
went
on
one
expect
a
warder
to
risk
his
situation
merely
to
help
a
prisoner
to
escape
he
smiled
as
the
warder
made
an
exclamation
of
nervous
warning
do
be
frightened
nibet
we
not
going
to
play
any
fool
games
but
let
us
talk
seriously
of
course
you
have
another
appointment
with
the
worthy
lady
who
gave
you
that
money
i
am
to
meet
her
at
eleven
in
the
boulevard
arago
nibet
said
after
a
moment
hesitation
good
said
gurn
well
you
are
to
tell
her
that
i
must
have
ten
thousand
francs
what
exclaimed
the
man
in
utter
astonishment
but
his
eyes
shone
with
greed
ten
thousand
francs
gurn
repeated
calmly
and
by
morning
fifteen
hundred
of
those
are
for
you
i
will
go
away
evening
there
was
a
tense
silence
the
warder
seemed
doubtful
and
gurn
turned
the
whole
of
his
will
power
upon
him
to
persuade
him
suppose
they
suspect
me
said
nibet
idiot
gurn
retorted
all
you
will
do
will
be
to
make
a
slip
in
your
duty
i
do
want
you
to
be
an
accomplice
listen
there
will
be
another
five
thousand
francs
for
you
and
if
things
turn
out
awkwardly
for
you
all
you
will
have
to
do
will
be
to
go
across
to
england
and
live
there
comfortably
for
the
rest
of
your
days
the
warder
was
obviously
almost
ready
to
comply
who
will
guarantee
me
he
asked
the
lady
i
tell
you
the
lady
of
the
boulevard
arago
here
give
her
this
and
he
tore
a
leaf
out
of
his
and
scribbling
a
few
words
on
it
handed
it
to
nibet
well
said
the
warder
hesitatingly
i
do
say
you
got
to
say
gurn
retorted
the
two
looked
steadily
in
each
other
eyes
then
the
warder
blenched
yes
he
said
nibet
was
going
away
and
was
already
almost
in
the
corridor
when
gurn
calmly
called
him
back
you
will
evolve
a
plan
and
i
will
start
do
forget
to
bring
me
a
the
orleans
company
will
do
the
murderer
was
not
disappointed
in
his
expectations
the
next
morning
nibet
appeared
with
a
mysterious
face
and
eager
eyes
he
took
a
small
bundle
from
underneath
his
jersey
and
gave
it
to
gurn
hide
that
in
your
bed
he
said
and
gurn
obeyed
the
morning
passed
without
further
developments
numerous
warders
came
and
went
in
the
corridor
attending
to
the
prisoners
and
gurn
could
get
no
private
talk
with
nibet
who
contrived
however
to
come
into
his
cell
several
times
on
various
pretexts
and
assure
him
with
a
nod
or
a
word
that
all
was
going
well
but
presently
when
walking
in
the
exercise
yard
the
two
men
were
able
to
have
a
conversation
nibet
manifested
an
intelligence
of
which
his
outer
appearance
gave
no
indication
but
it
seems
to
be
an
established
fact
that
the
inventive
faculties
even
of
men
of
inferior
mental
quality
are
sharpened
when
they
are
engaged
in
mischief
for
the
last
three
weeks
he
said
about
a
score
of
masons
have
been
working
in
the
prison
repairing
the
roof
and
doing
up
some
of
the
cells
cell
number
the
one
next
yours
is
empty
and
there
are
no
bars
on
the
window
the
masons
go
through
that
cell
and
that
window
to
get
on
to
the
roof
they
knock
off
work
soon
after
six
the
knows
them
all
but
he
does
not
always
look
closely
at
their
faces
when
they
go
by
and
you
might
perhaps
be
able
to
go
out
with
them
in
the
bundle
that
i
gave
you
there
is
a
pair
of
workman
trousers
and
a
waistcoat
and
a
felt
hat
put
those
on
at
about
a
quarter
to
six
the
men
who
went
up
on
to
the
roof
through
the
cell
come
down
by
way
of
the
skylights
to
the
staircase
that
leads
to
the
clerk
office
pass
the
office
where
they
are
asked
no
questions
cross
the
two
yards
and
go
out
by
the
main
gate
i
will
open
the
door
of
your
cell
a
few
minutes
before
six
and
you
must
go
into
the
empty
cell
next
yours
slip
up
on
to
the
roof
and
take
care
to
hide
behind
the
chimney
stacks
until
the
men
have
done
work
let
them
go
down
in
front
of
you
and
follow
behind
with
a
pick
or
a
shovel
on
your
shoulder
and
when
you
are
passing
the
clerk
or
anywhere
where
you
might
be
observed
mind
you
let
the
men
go
a
yard
or
two
in
front
of
you
when
the
gate
is
just
being
shut
after
the
last
workman
call
out
quietly
but
as
naturally
as
you
can
on
morin
mind
you
do
lock
me
in
i
not
one
of
your
lodgers
let
me
out
after
my
mates
make
some
joke
of
that
sort
and
when
you
are
once
outside
the
gate
by
george
my
boy
you
have
to
vamoose
gurn
listened
attentively
to
the
warder
instructions
lady
beltham
must
indeed
have
been
generous
and
have
made
the
man
perfectly
easy
on
the
score
of
his
own
future
in
one
of
the
pockets
of
the
clothes
nibet
went
on
i
have
put
ten
notes
you
asked
for
more
but
i
could
not
raise
it
we
can
settle
that
some
other
time
gurn
made
no
comment
when
will
my
escape
be
discovered
he
asked
i
am
on
night
duty
the
warder
answered
arrange
your
clothes
on
your
bed
to
make
it
look
as
if
you
were
in
bed
and
then
they
will
think
i
might
have
been
deceived
i
go
off
duty
at
five
the
next
round
is
at
eight
my
mate
will
open
the
door
of
the
cage
and
by
that
time
you
will
be
miles
away
gurn
nodded
comprehension
time
did
not
permit
of
longer
conversation
the
bell
had
rung
some
minutes
ago
proclaiming
that
the
exercise
time
was
over
the
two
men
hurried
upstairs
to
cell
number
on
the
third
floor
and
the
prisoner
was
locked
in
alone
while
nibet
went
about
his
duty
as
usual
xxvi
a
mysterious
crime
arriving
in
good
time
at
the
little
station
at
verrières
where
he
was
about
to
take
a
train
to
paris
to
keep
his
appointment
at
the
law
courts
the
old
steward
dollon
gave
his
parting
instructions
to
his
two
children
who
had
come
to
see
him
off
i
must
of
course
call
upon
mme
de
vibray
he
said
and
i
do
yet
know
what
time
fuselier
wants
to
see
me
at
his
office
anyhow
if
i
do
come
back
i
will
the
next
day
without
fail
well
little
ones
i
just
off
now
so
say
and
get
home
as
fast
as
you
can
it
looks
to
me
as
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
storm
and
i
should
like
to
know
that
you
were
safe
at
home
with
heavy
creaking
of
iron
wheels
and
hoarse
blowing
off
of
steam
from
the
engine
the
paris
train
drew
into
the
station
the
steward
gave
a
final
kiss
to
his
little
son
and
daughter
and
got
into
a
carriage
in
a
neighbouring
village
a
clock
had
just
struck
three
the
storm
had
been
raging
since
early
in
the
evening
but
now
it
seemed
informed
with
a
fresh
fury
the
rain
was
lashing
down
more
fiercely
and
the
wind
was
blowing
harder
still
making
the
slender
poplars
along
the
railway
line
bow
and
bend
before
the
squalls
and
assume
the
most
fantastic
shapes
but
vaguely
shown
against
the
night
the
night
was
inky
black
the
keenest
eye
could
make
out
nothing
at
all
distinctly
even
at
the
distance
of
a
few
yards
the
darkness
was
so
dense
as
to
seem
absolutely
solid
nevertheless
along
the
railway
embankment
a
man
was
making
his
way
with
steady
step
seeming
not
a
whit
disturbed
by
the
tragic
horror
of
the
storm
he
was
a
man
of
about
thirty
rather
well
dressed
in
a
large
waterproof
coat
the
collar
of
which
turned
up
to
his
ears
hid
the
lower
part
of
his
face
and
a
big
felt
hat
with
brim
turned
down
protecting
him
fairly
well
from
the
worst
of
the
weather
the
man
fought
his
way
against
the
wind
which
drove
into
his
overcoat
with
such
force
that
sometimes
it
almost
stopped
his
progress
and
he
trod
the
stony
track
without
paying
heed
to
the
sorry
plight
into
which
it
would
most
surely
put
the
thin
boots
he
was
wearing
awful
weather
he
growled
i
do
remember
such
a
shocking
night
for
years
wind
rain
every
conceivable
thing
but
i
must
grumble
for
the
total
absence
of
moon
will
be
uncommonly
useful
for
my
purpose
a
flash
of
lightning
streaked
the
horizon
and
the
man
stopped
and
looked
quickly
about
him
i
ca
be
far
from
the
place
he
thought
and
again
went
on
his
way
presently
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
here
i
am
at
last
at
this
spot
the
line
was
completely
enclosed
between
two
high
slopes
or
ran
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
cutting
it
better
here
the
man
said
to
himself
the
wind
passes
well
above
my
head
and
the
cutting
gives
good
shelter
he
stopped
and
carefully
deposited
on
the
ground
a
rather
bulky
bundle
he
had
been
carrying
under
his
arm
then
he
began
to
pace
up
and
down
stamping
his
feet
in
an
effort
to
keep
warm
it
has
just
struck
three
he
muttered
from
the
i
ca
expect
anything
for
another
ten
minutes
well
better
too
soon
than
too
late
he
contemplated
the
bundle
which
he
had
laid
down
a
few
minutes
before
it
heavier
than
i
thought
and
deucedly
in
the
way
but
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
bring
it
and
down
here
in
this
cutting
there
is
nothing
for
me
to
be
anxious
about
the
grass
is
thick
so
i
can
run
and
the
line
is
so
straight
that
i
shall
see
the
lights
of
the
train
a
long
way
off
a
thin
smile
curled
his
lips
who
would
have
thought
when
i
was
in
america
that
i
should
ever
find
it
so
useful
to
have
learnt
how
to
jump
a
train
a
dull
sound
in
the
distance
caught
his
ear
in
a
second
he
had
sprung
to
his
bundle
picked
it
up
and
choosing
a
spot
on
the
ballast
crouched
down
listening
at
the
place
where
he
stood
the
line
ran
up
a
steep
acclivity
it
was
from
the
lower
end
of
this
that
the
noise
he
had
heard
proceeded
and
now
was
growing
louder
almost
deafening
it
was
the
heavy
regular
puffing
of
a
powerful
engine
coming
up
a
steep
gradient
under
full
steam
no
mistake
my
star
is
with
me
the
man
muttered
and
as
the
train
approached
he
stretched
his
muscles
and
taking
a
firmer
grip
of
his
bundle
he
bent
forward
in
the
stooping
attitude
that
runners
take
when
about
to
start
off
in
a
race
with
a
heavy
roar
and
enveloped
in
clouds
of
steam
the
train
came
up
to
where
he
was
travelling
slowly
because
of
the
steep
gradient
certainly
less
than
twenty
miles
an
hour
the
moment
the
engine
had
passed
him
the
man
started
off
lithe
as
a
cat
and
ran
at
the
top
of
his
speed
the
train
of
course
gained
upon
him
the
tender
luggage
vans
and
carriages
passed
him
and
a
carriage
was
just
coming
up
with
him
the
pace
alone
would
have
deprived
almost
anyone
else
of
power
of
thought
but
this
man
was
evidently
a
athlete
for
the
moment
he
caught
sight
of
the
carriage
he
took
his
decision
with
a
tremendous
effort
he
caught
hold
of
the
and
sprang
upon
the
footboard
where
with
extraordinary
skill
he
contrived
to
remain
reaching
the
summit
of
the
slope
the
train
gathered
speed
and
with
an
even
louder
roar
began
its
headlong
journey
through
the
darkness
and
the
storm
which
seemed
to
increase
in
intensity
with
every
passing
minute
for
a
few
seconds
the
man
hung
on
where
he
was
then
when
he
had
regained
his
breath
he
got
on
to
the
upper
step
and
listened
at
the
door
of
the
corridor
at
which
he
found
himself
no
one
there
he
muttered
besides
everyone
will
be
asleep
and
chancing
everything
he
rose
up
opened
the
door
and
stepped
into
the
carriage
with
a
grunt
of
relief
making
no
attempt
to
conceal
himself
he
walked
boldly
into
the
lavatory
and
washed
his
face
that
was
blackened
with
the
smoke
from
outside
and
then
in
the
most
leisurely
natural
way
possible
he
came
out
of
the
lavatory
and
walked
along
the
corridor
soliloquising
aloud
manifestly
not
minding
whether
he
were
overheard
it
positively
maddening
no
one
can
sleep
with
travelling
companions
like
that
as
he
spoke
he
went
along
the
corridor
rapidly
glancing
into
every
compartment
in
one
three
men
were
asleep
obviously
unaware
that
anyone
was
surveying
them
from
outside
the
door
of
the
compartment
was
ajar
and
the
stranger
noiselessly
stepped
within
the
fourth
corner
was
unoccupied
and
here
the
man
took
his
seat
laying
his
bundle
down
beside
him
and
feigning
sleep
he
waited
motionless
for
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
until
he
was
quite
satisfied
that
his
companions
were
really
sleeping
soundly
then
he
slid
his
hand
into
the
bundle
by
his
side
seemed
to
be
doing
something
inside
it
then
withdrew
his
hand
noiselessly
stepped
out
of
the
compartment
and
carefully
closed
the
door
in
the
corridor
he
drew
a
sigh
of
relieved
satisfaction
and
took
a
cigar
from
his
pocket
everything
is
going
splendidly
he
said
to
himself
i
was
cursing
this
awful
storm
just
now
but
it
is
wonderfully
useful
to
me
on
such
a
night
as
this
no
one
would
dream
of
opening
the
windows
he
strolled
up
and
down
holding
on
to
the
with
one
hand
to
maintain
himself
against
the
rocking
of
the
train
and
every
now
and
then
taking
out
his
watch
with
the
other
to
see
the
time
i
have
any
too
much
time
he
muttered
i
shall
have
to
be
quick
or
my
friend
will
miss
his
train
he
smiled
as
if
amused
at
the
idea
and
then
holding
his
cigar
away
from
him
so
as
not
to
inhale
the
smoke
he
drew
several
deep
breaths
there
is
a
faint
smell
he
said
but
you
would
have
to
be
told
of
it
to
detect
it
the
devil
of
it
is
that
it
so
often
causes
nightmare
that
would
be
awful
he
suspended
his
patrol
and
listened
again
there
was
no
sound
to
be
heard
from
within
the
compartments
except
the
snoring
of
a
few
travellers
and
the
monotonous
rhythmical
noise
of
the
wheels
passing
over
the
joints
of
the
rails
come
i
waited
twenty
minutes
it
would
be
risky
to
wait
longer
let
get
to
work
he
stepped
briskly
back
into
the
compartment
and
furtively
glancing
into
the
corridor
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
there
he
went
across
to
the
opposite
window
and
opened
it
wide
he
put
his
head
out
into
the
air
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
turned
to
examine
his
travelling
companions
all
three
were
still
sound
asleep
the
man
gave
vent
to
a
dry
chuckle
he
drew
his
bundle
towards
him
felt
until
he
found
something
within
it
and
flung
it
back
on
to
the
seat
then
he
walked
up
to
the
man
opposite
him
slipped
his
hand
inside
his
coat
and
abstracted
a
and
began
to
examine
the
papers
it
contained
ah
he
exclaimed
suddenly
that
was
what
i
was
afraid
of
and
taking
one
of
the
papers
he
put
it
inside
his
own
chose
one
from
his
own
and
put
it
into
the
other
man
and
then
having
effected
this
exchange
replaced
the
man
property
and
chuckled
again
you
do
sleep
and
indeed
although
the
took
no
particular
precaution
the
man
continued
to
sleep
soundly
as
did
the
other
two
men
in
the
compartment
the
thief
looked
once
more
at
his
watch
time
he
leaned
out
of
the
open
window
and
slipped
back
the
safety
catch
then
he
opened
the
door
quite
wide
took
the
sleeping
traveller
by
the
shoulders
and
picked
him
up
from
the
seat
and
with
all
his
strength
sent
him
rolling
out
on
to
the
line
the
next
moment
he
seized
from
the
rack
the
light
articles
that
evidently
belonged
to
his
victim
and
threw
them
out
after
him
when
he
had
finished
his
ghastly
work
he
rubbed
his
hands
in
satisfaction
good
he
said
and
closing
the
door
again
but
leaving
the
window
down
he
left
the
compartment
not
troubling
to
pick
up
his
belongings
and
walked
along
the
corridors
to
another
compartment
towards
the
front
of
the
train
in
which
he
calmly
installed
himself
luck
has
been
with
me
he
muttered
as
he
stretched
himself
out
on
the
seat
everything
has
gone
off
well
no
one
has
seen
me
and
those
two
fools
who
might
have
upset
my
plans
will
wake
up
quite
naturally
when
they
begin
to
feel
the
cold
and
they
will
attribute
the
headache
they
will
probably
feel
to
their
tiring
journey
a
train
travelling
in
the
opposite
direction
suddenly
roared
past
the
window
and
made
him
jump
he
started
up
and
smiled
i
said
my
friend
would
miss
his
train
but
he
catch
it
in
another
five
minutes
in
another
five
minutes
luggage
and
body
and
the
entire
caboodle
will
be
mincemeat
and
as
if
completely
reassured
by
the
idea
he
chuckled
again
nothing
could
have
gone
better
i
can
have
a
rest
and
in
an
hour
time
i
shall
be
at
juvisy
where
thanks
to
my
forethought
i
shall
be
able
to
whitewash
myself
literally
one
thing
however
still
seemed
to
worry
him
he
did
not
know
exactly
where
on
the
line
he
had
thrown
his
unhappy
victim
but
he
had
an
idea
that
the
train
had
run
through
a
small
station
shortly
afterwards
if
that
was
so
the
body
might
be
found
sooner
than
he
would
have
liked
he
tried
to
dismiss
the
notion
from
his
mind
but
he
caught
sight
of
the
telegraph
posts
speeding
past
the
windows
and
he
shook
his
fist
at
them
malignantly
that
is
the
only
thing
that
can
harm
me
now
he
muttered
juvisy
juvisy
wait
here
two
minutes
it
was
barely
six
and
the
porters
hurried
along
the
train
calling
out
the
name
of
the
station
and
rousing
sleepy
travellers
from
their
dreams
a
man
jumped
nimbly
out
of
a
carriage
and
walked
towards
the
exit
from
the
station
holding
out
his
ticket
season
he
said
and
passed
out
rapidly
good
idea
that
season
ticket
he
said
to
himself
much
less
dangerous
than
an
ordinary
ticket
which
the
police
could
have
traced
he
walked
briskly
towards
the
subway
crossed
the
main
road
and
took
a
side
turning
that
led
down
towards
the
seine
taking
no
notice
of
the
mud
the
man
went
into
a
field
and
hid
himself
in
a
little
thicket
on
the
river
bank
he
looked
carefully
all
around
him
to
make
sure
that
he
was
unobserved
then
took
off
his
overcoat
jacket
and
trousers
and
drawing
a
bundle
from
one
of
the
pockets
of
his
large
waterproof
proceeded
to
dress
himself
anew
as
soon
as
he
was
dressed
he
spread
the
waterproof
out
on
the
ground
folded
up
in
it
the
clothes
and
hat
he
had
previously
been
wearing
added
a
number
of
heavy
stones
and
tied
the
whole
bundle
up
with
a
piece
of
string
he
swung
it
once
or
twice
at
the
full
length
of
his
arm
and
sent
it
hurtling
right
into
the
middle
of
the
river
where
it
sank
at
once
a
few
minutes
later
a
bricklayer
in
his
working
clothes
presented
himself
at
the
juvisy
booking
office
a
workman
ticket
to
paris
please
missus
he
said
and
having
got
it
the
man
went
on
to
the
departure
platform
it
would
have
been
risky
to
use
my
own
ticket
he
muttered
this
return
ticket
will
put
them
off
the
scent
and
with
a
smile
he
waited
for
the
train
that
would
take
him
to
paris
the
slow
train
from
luchon
was
drawing
near
its
paris
terminus
and
the
travellers
were
all
making
hasty
toilettes
and
tidying
themselves
up
after
their
long
night
journey
just
however
as
it
was
approaching
the
goods
station
it
slowed
down
and
stopped
the
passengers
surprised
put
their
heads
out
of
the
windows
to
ascertain
the
reason
for
the
unexpected
delay
hazarding
various
conjectures
but
unanimous
in
their
vituperation
of
the
company
three
men
were
walking
slowly
along
the
line
looking
carefully
at
every
door
two
were
porters
and
they
were
manifesting
the
most
respectful
attention
to
everything
the
third
man
said
he
was
a
grave
individual
very
correctly
attired
look
there
sir
one
of
the
porters
exclaimed
there
is
a
door
where
the
safety
catch
has
either
been
undone
or
not
fastened
that
is
the
only
one
on
the
train
that
is
so
said
the
gentleman
and
grasping
the
handle
he
opened
the
door
of
the
compartment
and
got
in
two
travellers
were
busy
strapping
up
their
bags
and
they
turned
round
in
simultaneous
surprise
you
will
pardon
me
gentlemen
when
you
know
who
i
am
said
the
intruder
and
throwing
open
his
coat
he
showed
his
tricolour
scarf
i
have
to
make
enquiry
relative
to
a
dead
body
that
has
been
found
on
the
line
near
brétigny
it
probably
fell
from
this
train
and
perhaps
from
this
compartment
for
i
have
just
observed
that
the
safety
catch
is
not
fastened
where
did
you
get
into
the
train
the
two
passengers
looked
at
one
another
in
astonishment
what
a
dreadful
thing
one
of
them
exclaimed
why
sir
while
my
friend
here
and
i
were
asleep
one
of
our
did
disappear
i
made
a
remark
about
it
but
this
gentleman
very
reasonably
pointed
out
that
he
must
have
got
out
at
some
station
while
we
were
asleep
the
official
was
keenly
interested
what
was
this
passenger
like
quite
easily
recognised
sir
a
man
of
about
sixty
rather
stout
and
wearing
whiskers
that
tallies
with
the
description
might
he
have
been
a
butler
or
a
steward
that
is
exactly
what
he
looked
like
then
that
must
be
the
man
whose
body
has
been
found
upon
the
line
but
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
case
of
suicide
or
of
murder
for
some
hand
baggage
has
been
picked
up
as
well
a
suicide
would
not
have
thrown
his
luggage
out
and
a
thief
would
not
have
wanted
to
get
rid
of
it
the
passenger
who
had
not
yet
spoken
broke
in
you
are
wrong
sir
at
any
rate
all
his
luggage
was
not
thrown
on
to
the
line
and
he
pointed
to
the
bundle
left
upon
the
seat
i
thought
that
belonged
to
the
gentleman
here
but
he
has
just
told
me
it
his
the
official
rapidly
unfastened
the
straps
and
started
back
hullo
a
bottle
of
liquid
carbonic
acid
now
what
does
that
mean
he
looked
at
it
did
this
bundle
belong
to
the
man
who
disappeared
the
two
passengers
shook
their
heads
i
do
think
so
one
of
them
said
i
should
certainly
have
noticed
that
scotch
rug
but
i
did
not
see
it
then
there
was
a
fourth
passenger
in
this
compartment
the
official
enquired
no
we
travelled
alone
said
one
of
the
men
but
the
other
dissented
it
is
very
odd
and
i
am
not
sure
about
it
but
i
really
am
wondering
whether
someone
did
not
get
into
our
compartment
last
night
while
we
were
asleep
i
have
a
vague
impression
that
someone
did
but
i
ca
be
sure
do
try
to
remember
sir
the
official
urged
him
it
is
of
the
very
highest
importance
but
the
passenger
shook
his
shoulders
doubtfully
no
i
really
ca
say
anything
definite
and
besides
i
have
a
shocking
headache
the
official
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
in
my
opinion
gentlemen
you
have
been
uncommonly
lucky
to
escape
murder
yourselves
i
do
not
quite
understand
yet
how
the
murder
was
done
but
i
incline
to
think
it
proves
almost
incredible
daring
however
he
stopped
and
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
you
can
send
the
train
on
now
he
called
to
a
porter
and
resumed
however
i
must
ask
you
to
accompany
me
to
the
stationmaster
office
and
give
me
your
names
and
addresses
and
to
help
me
afterwards
in
the
conduct
of
the
legal
investigation
the
two
travellers
looked
at
one
another
in
distressed
surprise
it
is
really
appalling
said
one
of
them
you
not
safe
anywhere
nowadays
you
really
are
the
other
agreed
such
a
number
of
awful
murders
and
crimes
are
being
perpetrated
every
day
that
you
would
think
not
one
but
a
dozen
fantômas
were
at
work
xxvii
three
surprising
incidents
nibet
went
off
duty
at
five
in
the
morning
and
returned
to
his
own
home
to
go
to
bed
as
a
general
rule
he
slept
like
a
top
after
a
night
on
duty
but
on
this
occasion
he
could
not
close
an
eye
being
far
too
uneasy
about
the
consequences
of
his
in
gurn
escape
a
few
minutes
before
six
in
the
evening
he
had
taken
advantage
of
no
warders
being
about
to
slip
gurn
from
cell
number
into
number
whence
he
could
make
his
way
to
the
roof
at
six
when
he
actually
came
on
duty
nibet
opened
the
peephole
in
the
door
of
number
as
he
did
in
all
the
others
and
saw
that
gurn
had
made
an
admirable
dummy
figure
in
the
bed
it
was
so
good
that
it
even
deceived
a
head
warder
who
made
a
single
rapid
inspection
of
all
the
cells
when
nibet
was
on
one
of
his
several
rounds
during
the
night
obviously
gurn
must
have
got
clear
away
from
the
prison
for
if
he
had
been
caught
it
would
certainly
have
become
generally
known
these
reflections
somewhat
comforted
the
restless
man
but
he
knew
that
the
most
difficult
part
of
his
task
was
still
before
him
the
difficulty
of
simulating
astonishment
and
distress
when
he
should
get
back
to
the
prison
presently
and
be
told
by
his
of
the
escape
and
the
difficulty
of
answering
in
a
natural
manner
to
the
close
interrogation
to
which
he
would
be
subjected
by
the
governor
and
the
police
and
possibly
even
fuselier
who
would
be
in
a
fine
rage
when
he
learned
that
his
captive
had
escaped
him
nibet
meant
to
pretend
ignorance
and
even
stupidity
he
would
far
rather
be
called
a
fool
than
found
out
to
be
a
knave
and
an
accomplice
about
eleven
nibet
got
up
gurn
escape
must
certainly
be
known
at
the
prison
by
this
time
the
warder
on
duty
would
have
gone
to
the
cell
about
seven
to
wake
the
prisoner
and
though
nothing
might
have
been
detected
then
the
cell
would
infallibly
have
been
found
to
be
empty
at
eight
when
the
morning
broth
was
taken
round
and
then
as
he
walked
from
his
home
round
to
the
prison
nibet
met
the
gang
of
masons
coming
out
for
dinner
he
crossed
the
street
towards
them
hoping
to
hear
some
news
but
they
passed
by
him
in
silence
one
or
two
of
them
giving
a
careless
nod
or
word
of
greeting
at
first
nibet
took
their
silence
for
a
bad
sign
thinking
they
might
have
been
warned
to
give
him
no
alarm
but
he
reflected
that
if
gurn
escape
were
discovered
as
it
surely
must
be
the
authorities
would
probably
prefer
not
to
let
the
matter
become
widely
known
as
he
reached
the
porter
lodge
his
heart
beat
violently
what
would
old
morin
have
to
tell
him
but
old
morin
was
very
busy
trying
to
make
his
kitchen
fire
burn
properly
instead
of
sending
all
the
smoke
pouring
out
into
the
room
the
old
man
slovenly
figure
was
just
visible
in
a
clearing
in
the
smoke
and
he
returned
nibet
salutation
with
nothing
more
than
a
silent
salute
that
funny
thought
nibet
and
he
passed
through
the
main
courtyard
towards
the
clerks
offices
at
the
end
through
the
windows
he
could
see
the
staff
a
few
bending
over
their
work
most
of
them
reading
newspapers
none
of
them
obviously
interested
in
anything
special
next
he
presented
himself
before
the
warders
turnkey
and
again
he
was
allowed
to
pass
on
without
a
word
by
this
time
gurn
accomplice
was
in
a
state
of
such
nervous
tension
that
he
could
hardly
restrain
himself
from
catching
hold
of
one
or
other
of
the
warders
whom
he
saw
at
their
work
and
asking
them
questions
how
could
the
escape
of
so
important
a
prisoner
as
the
man
who
had
murdered
lord
beltham
create
so
little
excitement
as
this
nibet
longed
to
rush
up
the
flights
of
stairs
to
number
and
interrogate
the
warder
who
had
gone
on
duty
after
himself
and
whom
he
was
now
about
to
relieve
in
turn
he
must
surely
know
all
about
it
but
it
would
not
do
to
create
suspicion
and
nibet
had
sufficient
left
to
go
upstairs
at
his
usual
leisurely
pace
outwardly
calm
and
steady
he
reached
his
post
just
as
the
clock
was
striking
twelve
he
was
ever
punctuality
itself
and
he
was
due
on
duty
at
noon
well
colas
he
said
to
his
colleague
here
i
am
you
can
go
now
good
said
the
warder
i
be
off
at
once
i
on
again
at
six
and
he
moved
away
everything
all
right
nibet
enquired
in
a
tone
he
tried
to
make
as
casual
as
possible
but
that
trembled
a
little
nevertheless
quite
said
colas
perfectly
naturally
and
he
went
away
nibet
could
contain
himself
no
longer
and
the
next
second
he
threw
caution
to
the
winds
rushing
to
gurn
cell
he
flung
the
door
open
gurn
was
there
sitting
on
the
foot
of
his
bed
with
his
legs
crossed
and
a
on
his
knees
making
notes
with
the
quietest
attention
he
scarcely
appeared
to
notice
nibet
violent
invasion
oh
so
you
are
there
stammered
the
astonished
warder
gurn
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
the
warder
with
a
cryptic
gaze
yes
i
here
all
manner
of
notions
crowded
through
nibet
brain
but
he
could
find
words
for
none
of
them
had
the
plot
been
discovered
before
gurn
had
had
time
to
get
away
or
had
a
trap
been
laid
for
himself
through
the
medium
of
one
of
the
prisoners
to
test
his
own
incorruptibility
nibet
went
white
and
leaned
against
the
wall
for
support
at
last
gurn
spoke
again
reassuring
him
with
a
smile
do
look
so
miserable
he
said
i
am
here
that
is
a
matter
of
absolutely
no
importance
we
will
suppose
that
nothing
passed
between
us
yesterday
and
that
an
end
to
it
so
you
have
gone
you
did
go
said
nibet
again
no
gurn
replied
since
you
are
so
interested
all
i
need
say
is
that
i
was
afraid
to
risk
it
at
the
last
minute
nibet
had
cast
a
keen
and
experienced
eye
all
over
the
cell
under
the
washstand
he
saw
the
little
bundle
of
clothes
which
he
had
brought
the
prisoner
the
previous
day
he
rightly
opined
that
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
remove
these
dangerous
articles
whose
presence
in
gurn
cell
would
appear
very
suspicious
if
they
happened
to
be
discovered
he
took
the
bundle
and
was
hurriedly
stowing
it
away
under
his
own
clothes
when
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
the
things
were
wet
and
he
knew
from
his
own
experience
that
the
rain
had
never
ceased
throughout
the
whole
of
the
night
gurn
he
said
reproachfully
you
are
up
to
some
trick
these
things
are
soaked
you
must
have
gone
out
last
night
or
these
things
would
not
be
like
this
gurn
smiled
sympathetically
at
the
warder
not
so
bad
he
remarked
that
pretty
good
reasoning
for
a
mere
gaoler
and
as
nibet
was
about
to
press
the
matter
gurn
anticipated
his
questions
and
made
frank
confession
well
yes
i
did
try
to
get
out
got
as
far
as
the
clerk
office
last
evening
but
at
the
last
minute
i
funked
it
and
went
back
on
to
the
roof
but
when
i
got
into
number
again
i
found
i
could
not
get
back
into
my
own
cell
for
as
you
know
was
locked
outside
so
to
avoid
detection
i
returned
to
the
roof
and
spent
the
night
there
at
daybreak
i
took
advantage
of
the
little
disturbance
caused
by
the
workmen
coming
in
and
slipped
down
from
the
roof
just
as
they
were
going
up
as
soon
as
i
found
myself
on
this
floor
i
ran
along
this
corridor
and
slipped
into
my
cell
when
your
friend
colas
brought
me
my
broth
he
did
not
notice
that
my
cell
was
unlocked
and
there
you
are
the
explanation
was
not
altogether
convincing
but
nibet
listened
to
it
and
pondered
the
situation
on
the
whole
it
was
much
better
that
things
should
be
as
they
were
but
the
warder
was
wondering
how
the
great
lady
who
paid
so
mighty
well
might
take
the
matter
she
most
certainly
had
not
promised
so
large
a
sum
of
money
nor
paid
the
good
round
sum
of
ten
thousand
francs
down
in
advance
merely
in
order
that
gurn
might
have
a
little
walk
upon
the
tiles
what
was
to
be
done
with
regard
to
that
personage
with
much
ingenuousness
nibet
confided
his
anxiety
to
the
prisoner
who
laughed
it
not
all
over
yet
he
declared
indeed
it
is
only
just
beginning
what
if
we
only
wanted
to
test
you
and
prove
your
quality
make
your
mind
easy
nibet
if
gurn
is
in
prison
at
the
present
moment
it
is
because
he
has
his
own
reasons
for
being
there
but
who
is
able
to
predict
the
future
it
was
time
for
gurn
to
go
to
the
exercise
yard
and
nibet
reassuming
the
uncompromising
attitude
that
all
warders
ought
to
maintain
when
in
custody
of
prisoners
led
the
murderer
down
to
the
courtyard
in
his
office
at
the
law
courts
fuselier
was
having
a
private
interview
with
juve
and
listening
with
much
interest
to
what
the
clever
detective
inspector
was
saying
to
him
i
tell
you
again
sir
i
attach
great
importance
to
the
finding
of
this
ordnance
map
in
gurn
rooms
yes
said
fuselier
with
a
touch
of
scepticism
and
i
will
tell
you
why
juve
went
on
about
a
year
ago
when
i
was
engaged
on
the
case
of
the
murder
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
at
her
château
of
beaulieu
down
in
lot
i
found
a
small
piece
of
a
map
showing
the
district
in
which
i
was
at
the
time
i
took
it
to
de
presles
the
magistrate
who
was
conducting
the
enquiry
he
attached
no
importance
to
it
and
i
myself
could
not
see
at
the
time
that
it
gave
us
any
new
evidence
quite
so
said
fuselier
there
is
nothing
particularly
remarkable
in
finding
a
map
or
a
piece
of
a
map
showing
a
district
in
the
district
itself
those
are
de
presles
very
words
to
me
said
juve
with
a
smile
and
i
will
give
you
the
same
answer
i
gave
him
namely
that
if
some
day
we
could
find
the
other
portion
of
the
map
which
completed
the
first
piece
we
found
and
could
identify
the
owner
of
the
two
portions
there
would
then
be
a
formal
basis
on
which
to
proceed
to
base
an
argument
proceed
to
base
it
fuselier
suggested
that
very
easy
said
juve
the
fragment
of
map
numbered
found
at
beaulieu
belongs
to
i
do
not
know
who
x
is
but
in
paris
in
rooms
i
find
the
fragment
of
map
numbered
which
belongs
to
gurn
if
it
turns
out
as
i
expect
that
the
two
fragments
of
map
when
placed
together
form
a
single
and
complete
whole
i
shall
conclude
logically
that
x
who
was
the
owner
of
fragment
number
is
the
same
as
the
owner
of
fragment
number
to
wit
gurn
how
are
you
going
to
find
out
enquired
fuselier
it
is
in
order
to
find
it
out
that
we
have
sent
for
dollon
juve
replied
he
was
steward
to
the
late
marquise
de
langrune
and
has
all
the
circumstantial
evidence
relating
to
that
case
if
he
has
still
got
the
fragment
of
map
it
will
be
simplicity
itself
to
prove
what
i
have
suggested
and
perhaps
to
make
the
identification
i
suggest
yes
said
fuselier
but
if
you
do
succeed
will
it
be
of
really
great
importance
in
your
opinion
will
you
be
able
to
infer
from
that
one
fact
that
gurn
and
the
man
who
murdered
the
marquise
de
langrune
are
one
and
the
same
person
is
not
that
going
rather
far
especially
as
if
i
remember
rightly
it
was
proved
that
the
murderer
in
that
case
was
the
son
of
a
rambert
and
this
young
rambert
committed
suicide
after
the
crime
juve
evaded
the
issue
well
we
shall
see
was
all
he
said
the
magistrate
clerk
came
into
the
room
and
unceremoniously
interrupted
the
conversation
it
has
gone
two
sir
he
said
there
are
some
prisoners
to
examine
and
a
whole
lot
of
witnesses
and
he
placed
two
bulky
bundles
of
papers
before
the
magistrate
and
waited
for
a
sign
to
call
the
various
persons
free
or
otherwise
whom
the
magistrate
had
to
see
the
first
bundle
caught
juve
attention
it
was
endorsed
royal
palace
hotel
case
anything
new
about
the
robbery
from
mme
van
den
rosen
and
princess
sonia
danidoff
he
enquired
and
as
the
magistrate
shook
his
head
he
added
are
you
going
to
examine
muller
now
yes
said
the
magistrate
at
once
and
after
that
you
are
to
examine
gurn
are
you
in
connection
with
the
beltham
case
quite
so
i
wish
you
would
oblige
me
by
confronting
the
two
men
here
in
my
presence
fuselier
looked
up
in
surprise
he
could
not
see
what
connection
there
could
be
between
the
two
utterly
dissimilar
cases
what
object
could
juve
have
in
wanting
the
man
who
had
murdered
lord
beltham
to
be
confronted
with
the
unimportant
little
hotel
servant
who
had
really
been
arrested
rather
as
a
concession
to
public
opinion
than
because
he
was
actually
deemed
capable
of
burglary
or
attempted
burglary
might
not
juve
with
his
known
mania
for
associating
all
crimes
with
each
other
be
going
just
a
little
too
far
in
the
present
instance
you
have
got
some
idea
in
the
back
of
your
head
said
fuselier
i
got
a
a
scar
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
juve
answered
with
a
smile
and
as
the
magistrate
confessed
that
he
failed
to
understand
juve
enlightened
him
we
know
that
the
man
who
did
that
robbery
at
the
royal
palace
hotel
burned
his
hand
badly
when
he
was
cutting
the
electric
wires
in
the
princess
bathroom
well
a
few
weeks
ago
while
i
was
on
the
look
out
for
someone
with
a
scar
from
such
a
wound
i
was
told
of
a
man
who
was
prowling
about
the
slums
i
had
the
fellow
followed
up
and
the
very
night
the
hunt
began
i
was
going
to
arrest
him
when
a
good
deal
to
my
surprise
i
discovered
that
he
was
no
other
than
gurn
he
escaped
me
that
time
but
when
he
was
caught
later
on
i
found
that
he
has
an
unmistakable
scar
inside
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
it
is
fading
now
for
the
burn
was
only
superficial
but
it
is
there
now
do
you
see
my
idea
yes
i
do
the
magistrate
exclaimed
and
i
am
all
the
more
glad
to
hear
of
it
since
i
am
to
have
both
the
men
here
now
shall
i
have
muller
in
first
juve
assented
so
you
still
refuse
to
confess
said
the
magistrate
at
last
you
still
maintain
that
your
extraordinary
order
to
let
the
waiter
out
was
given
in
good
faith
yes
yes
yes
sir
the
night
watchman
answered
that
very
evening
a
new
servant
had
joined
the
staff
i
had
not
even
set
eyes
on
him
when
i
saw
this
stranger
i
took
him
to
be
the
servant
who
had
been
engaged
the
day
before
and
i
told
them
to
open
the
door
for
him
that
is
the
real
truth
and
that
is
all
that
is
positively
all
we
are
only
charging
you
with
complicity
the
magistrate
went
on
for
the
man
who
touched
the
electric
wires
burned
his
hand
that
is
a
strong
point
in
your
favour
and
you
also
say
that
if
the
thief
were
put
before
you
you
could
recognise
him
yes
said
the
man
confidently
good
said
fuselier
and
he
signed
to
his
clerk
to
call
in
another
personage
the
clerk
understood
and
gurn
was
brought
in
between
two
municipal
guards
and
was
followed
by
the
young
licentiate
in
law
maître
roger
de
seras
who
represented
his
leader
at
most
of
these
preliminary
examinations
as
gurn
came
in
with
the
light
from
the
window
falling
full
on
his
face
fuselier
gave
a
curt
order
muller
turn
round
and
look
at
this
man
muller
obeyed
and
surveyed
with
some
bewilderment
and
without
the
least
comprehension
the
bold
head
and
the
muscular
frame
of
lord
beltham
murderer
gurn
did
not
flinch
do
you
recognise
that
man
the
magistrate
demanded
muller
ransacked
his
brains
and
looked
again
at
gurn
then
shook
his
head
no
sir
gurn
open
your
right
hand
the
magistrate
ordered
show
it
and
he
turned
again
to
muller
the
man
before
you
seems
to
have
been
burned
in
the
palm
of
the
hand
as
that
scar
shows
can
you
not
remember
having
seen
that
man
at
the
royal
palace
hotel
muller
looked
steadily
at
gurn
on
my
honour
sir
although
it
would
be
to
my
interest
to
recognise
him
i
am
bound
to
acknowledge
that
i
really
and
truly
do
fuselier
had
a
brief
conversation
aside
with
juve
and
then
the
detective
appearing
to
agree
with
him
turned
once
more
to
the
night
watchman
muller
he
said
the
court
is
pleased
with
your
frankness
you
will
be
set
free
provisionally
but
you
are
to
hold
yourself
at
the
disposal
of
the
court
of
enquiry
and
he
signed
to
the
municipal
guards
to
lead
the
gratefully
protesting
man
away
meanwhile
gurn
case
appeared
to
him
to
be
becoming
much
more
serious
and
much
more
interesting
he
had
the
prisoner
placed
in
front
of
him
while
juve
who
had
withdrawn
into
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
never
took
his
eyes
off
the
murderer
gurn
he
began
can
you
give
me
an
account
of
your
time
during
the
second
half
of
december
of
last
year
gurn
was
unprepared
for
the
question
and
made
a
gesture
of
doubt
fuselier
probably
anticipating
a
sensation
was
just
on
the
point
of
ordering
dollon
to
be
called
when
he
was
interrupted
by
a
discreet
tap
on
the
door
his
clerk
went
to
answer
it
and
saw
a
gendarme
standing
at
the
door
at
almost
the
first
words
he
said
the
clerk
uttered
an
exclamation
and
wheeled
round
to
the
magistrate
oh
fuselier
listen
they
have
just
told
me
but
the
gendarme
had
come
in
he
saluted
the
magistrate
and
handed
him
a
letter
which
fuselier
hastily
tore
open
and
read
to
germain
fuselier
examining
magistrate
the
law
courts
paris
the
special
commissioner
at
brétigny
station
has
the
honour
to
report
that
this
morning
at
the
police
informed
him
of
the
discovery
on
the
railway
line
five
kilomètres
from
brétigny
on
the
orléans
side
of
the
dead
body
of
a
man
who
must
either
have
fallen
accidentally
or
been
thrown
intentionally
from
a
train
bound
for
paris
the
body
had
been
mutilated
by
a
train
travelling
in
the
other
direction
but
papers
found
on
the
person
of
the
deceased
and
in
particular
a
summons
found
in
his
pocket
show
that
his
name
was
dollon
and
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
paris
to
wait
upon
you
the
special
commissioner
at
brétigny
station
has
quite
late
been
informed
of
the
following
facts
passengers
who
left
the
train
on
its
arrival
at
the
austerlitz
terminus
at
were
examined
by
the
special
commissioner
at
that
station
and
subsequently
allowed
to
go
possibly
you
have
already
been
informed
we
have
however
thought
it
our
duty
after
having
searched
the
body
to
report
this
identification
to
you
and
have
therefore
requisitioned
an
officer
of
the
police
at
brétigny
to
convey
to
you
the
information
contained
in
this
communication
fuselier
had
turned
pale
as
he
read
this
letter
he
handed
it
to
juve
with
feverish
haste
the
famous
detective
read
it
through
and
wheeled
round
to
the
gendarme
tell
me
do
you
know
what
has
been
done
do
you
know
if
this
papers
all
his
papers
were
found
and
have
been
preserved
the
man
shook
his
head
in
ignorance
juve
clasped
the
magistrate
hand
i
off
to
brétigny
this
instant
he
said
in
a
low
tone
throughout
this
incident
maître
roger
de
seras
had
remained
in
a
state
of
blank
incomprehension
gurn
face
was
more
expressionless
and
impenetrable
than
ever
xxviii
the
court
of
assize
call
lady
beltham
it
was
a
perfect
may
day
and
everyone
who
could
pretend
on
any
conceivable
ground
to
belong
to
paris
had
schemed
and
intrigued
to
obtain
admission
to
a
trial
over
which
public
opinion
had
been
excited
for
months
the
trial
of
gurn
for
the
murder
of
lord
beltham
and
foremost
man
of
fashion
whose
murder
two
years
before
had
caused
a
great
sensation
the
preliminary
formalities
of
the
trial
had
furnished
nothing
to
tickle
the
palates
of
the
crowd
the
indictment
had
been
almost
inaudible
and
besides
it
contained
nothing
that
had
not
already
been
made
public
by
the
press
nor
had
the
examination
of
the
prisoner
been
any
more
interesting
gurn
sat
strangely
impassive
in
the
dock
between
two
municipal
guards
and
hardly
listened
to
his
counsel
the
eminent
maître
barberoux
who
was
assisted
by
a
galaxy
of
juniors
including
young
roger
de
seras
moreover
gurn
had
frankly
confessed
his
guilt
almost
immediately
after
his
arrest
there
was
not
much
for
him
to
add
to
what
he
had
said
before
although
the
president
of
the
court
pressed
him
as
to
some
points
which
were
still
not
satisfactorily
clear
with
respect
to
his
own
identity
and
the
motives
which
had
prompted
him
to
commit
his
crime
and
subsequently
to
pay
that
most
risky
visit
to
lady
beltham
at
the
close
of
which
juve
had
effected
his
arrest
but
lady
beltham
evidence
promised
to
be
much
more
interesting
rumour
had
been
busy
for
a
long
time
with
the
great
lady
and
her
feelings
and
odd
stories
were
being
whispered
she
was
said
to
be
beautiful
wealthy
and
charitable
people
said
under
their
breath
that
she
must
know
a
good
deal
about
the
murder
of
her
spouse
and
when
she
made
her
appearance
in
the
box
a
sudden
hush
fell
upon
the
crowded
court
she
was
indeed
a
most
appealing
figure
robed
in
long
black
weeds
young
graceful
and
very
pale
so
sympathetic
a
figure
that
scandal
was
forgotten
in
the
general
tense
desire
to
hear
her
answers
to
the
president
of
the
court
following
the
usher
to
the
she
took
off
her
gloves
as
desired
and
in
a
voice
that
trembled
slightly
but
was
beautifully
modulated
repeated
the
words
of
the
oath
with
her
right
hand
raised
the
while
noticing
her
agitation
the
president
mitigated
somewhat
the
harshness
of
the
tone
in
which
he
generally
spoke
to
witnesses
pray
compose
yourself
madame
i
am
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
subject
you
to
this
examination
but
the
interests
of
justice
require
it
come
now
you
are
lady
beltham
widow
of
the
late
lord
beltham
of
english
nationality
residing
in
paris
at
your
own
house
in
neuilly
yes
will
you
kindly
turn
round
madame
and
tell
me
if
you
know
the
prisoner
in
the
dock
lady
beltham
obeyed
mechanically
she
glanced
at
gurn
who
paled
a
little
and
answered
the
president
yes
i
know
the
prisoner
his
name
is
gurn
very
good
madame
can
you
tell
me
first
of
all
how
you
came
to
be
acquainted
with
him
when
my
husband
was
in
south
africa
at
the
time
of
the
boer
war
gurn
was
a
sergeant
in
the
regular
army
it
was
then
that
i
first
met
him
did
you
know
him
well
at
that
time
lady
beltham
seemed
to
be
unable
to
prevent
herself
from
casting
long
glances
at
the
prisoner
she
appeared
to
be
almost
hypnotised
and
frightened
by
his
close
proximity
i
saw
very
little
of
gurn
in
the
transvaal
she
answered
it
was
just
by
chance
that
i
learned
his
name
but
of
course
the
difference
between
his
own
rank
and
my
husband
position
made
the
relations
that
i
could
have
with
a
mere
sergeant
very
limited
indeed
yes
gurn
was
a
sergeant
the
president
said
and
after
the
war
madame
did
you
see
the
prisoner
again
yes
immediately
after
the
war
my
husband
and
i
went
to
england
by
the
same
boat
on
which
gurn
went
home
did
you
see
much
of
him
on
board
no
we
were
passengers
and
he
i
believe
went
second
it
was
just
by
accident
that
my
husband
caught
sight
of
him
soon
after
the
boat
sailed
the
president
paused
and
made
a
note
were
those
all
the
relations
your
husband
had
with
the
prisoner
they
are
at
any
rate
all
the
relations
i
had
with
him
lady
beltham
replied
in
tones
of
some
distress
but
i
know
that
my
husband
employed
gurn
on
several
occasions
to
help
him
in
various
affairs
and
matters
of
business
thank
you
said
the
president
we
will
return
to
that
point
presently
meanwhile
there
is
one
question
i
should
like
to
ask
you
if
you
had
met
the
prisoner
in
the
street
a
few
months
ago
should
you
have
recognised
him
was
his
face
still
distinct
in
your
memory
or
had
it
become
blurred
and
vague
lady
beltham
hesitated
then
answered
confidently
i
am
sure
i
should
not
have
recognised
him
and
some
proof
of
this
is
that
just
before
his
arrest
was
effected
i
was
conversing
with
the
prisoner
for
several
minutes
without
having
the
faintest
idea
that
the
poor
man
with
whom
i
imagined
i
had
to
do
was
no
other
than
the
man
gurn
for
whom
the
police
were
looking
the
president
nodded
and
maître
barberoux
leaned
forward
and
spoke
eagerly
to
his
client
in
the
dock
but
the
president
continued
immediately
you
must
forgive
me
madame
for
putting
a
question
that
may
seem
rather
brutal
and
also
for
reminding
you
of
your
oath
to
tell
us
the
entire
truth
did
you
love
your
husband
lady
beltham
quivered
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
as
though
endeavouring
to
frame
a
right
answer
lord
beltham
was
much
older
than
myself
she
began
and
then
perceiving
the
meaning
implicit
in
her
words
she
added
i
had
the
very
highest
esteem
for
him
and
a
very
real
affection
a
cynical
smile
curled
the
lip
of
the
president
and
he
glanced
at
the
jury
as
though
asking
them
to
pay
still
closer
attention
do
you
know
why
i
put
that
question
to
you
he
asked
and
as
lady
beltham
confessed
her
ignorance
he
went
on
it
has
been
suggested
madame
by
a
rumour
which
is
very
generally
current
in
the
newspapers
and
among
people
generally
that
the
prisoner
may
possibly
have
been
greatly
enamoured
of
you
that
perhaps
well
is
there
any
truth
in
this
as
he
spoke
the
president
bent
forward
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
pierce
right
through
lady
beltham
it
is
a
wicked
calumny
she
protested
turning
very
pale
throughout
the
proceedings
gurn
had
been
sitting
in
an
attitude
of
absolute
indifference
almost
of
scorn
but
now
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
uttered
a
defiant
protest
sir
he
said
to
the
president
of
the
court
i
desire
to
say
publicly
here
that
i
have
the
most
profound
and
unalterable
respect
for
lady
beltham
anyone
who
has
given
currency
to
the
malignant
rumour
you
refer
to
is
a
liar
i
have
confessed
that
i
killed
lord
beltham
and
i
do
not
retract
that
confession
but
i
never
made
any
attempt
upon
his
honour
and
no
word
nor
look
nor
deed
has
ever
passed
between
lady
beltham
and
myself
that
might
not
have
passed
before
lord
beltham
own
eyes
the
president
looked
sharply
at
the
prisoner
then
tell
me
what
your
motive
was
in
murdering
your
victim
i
have
told
you
already
lady
beltham
is
not
to
be
implicated
in
my
deed
in
any
way
i
had
constant
business
dealings
with
lord
beltham
i
asked
him
over
the
telephone
to
come
to
my
place
one
day
he
came
we
had
an
animated
discussion
he
got
warm
and
i
answered
angrily
then
i
lost
control
of
myself
and
in
a
moment
of
madness
i
killed
him
i
am
profoundly
sorry
for
my
crime
and
stoop
to
crave
pardon
for
it
but
i
can
not
tolerate
the
suggestion
that
the
murder
i
committed
was
in
the
remotest
way
due
to
sentimental
relations
with
a
lady
who
is
i
repeat
entitled
to
the
very
highest
respect
from
the
whole
world
a
murmur
of
sympathy
ran
through
the
court
at
this
chivalrous
declaration
by
which
the
jury
who
had
not
missed
a
word
seemed
to
be
entirely
convinced
but
the
president
was
trained
to
track
truth
in
detail
and
he
turned
again
to
lady
beltham
who
still
stood
in
the
very
pale
and
swaying
with
distress
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
attach
no
importance
to
a
mere
assertion
madame
the
existence
of
some
relations
between
yourself
and
the
prisoner
which
delicacy
would
prompt
him
to
conceal
and
honour
would
compel
you
to
deny
would
alter
the
whole
aspect
of
this
case
he
turned
to
the
usher
recall
mme
doulenques
please
mme
doulenques
considered
it
a
tremendous
honour
to
be
called
as
witness
in
a
trial
with
which
the
press
was
ringing
and
was
particularly
excited
because
she
had
just
been
requested
to
pose
for
her
photograph
by
a
representative
of
her
own
favourite
paper
she
followed
the
usher
to
where
lady
beltham
stood
you
told
us
just
now
mme
doulenques
the
president
said
suavely
that
your
lodger
gurn
often
received
visits
from
a
lady
friend
you
also
said
that
if
this
lady
were
placed
before
you
you
would
certainly
recognise
her
now
will
you
kindly
look
at
the
lady
in
the
box
is
this
the
same
person
mme
doulenques
crimson
with
excitement
and
nervously
twisting
in
her
hands
a
huge
pair
of
white
gloves
which
she
had
bought
for
this
occasion
looked
curiously
at
lady
beltham
upon
my
word
i
ca
be
sure
that
this
is
the
lady
she
said
after
quite
a
long
pause
but
you
were
so
certain
of
your
facts
just
now
the
president
smiled
encouragingly
but
i
ca
see
the
lady
very
well
with
all
those
veils
on
mme
doulenques
protested
lady
beltham
did
not
wait
for
the
request
which
the
president
would
inevitably
have
made
but
haughtily
put
back
her
veil
do
you
recognise
me
now
she
said
coldly
the
scorn
in
her
tone
upset
mme
doulenques
she
looked
again
at
lady
beltham
and
turned
instinctively
as
if
to
ask
enlightenment
from
gurn
whose
face
however
was
expressionless
and
then
replied
it
just
what
i
told
you
before
your
worship
i
ca
be
sure
i
could
swear
to
it
but
you
think
she
is
you
know
your
worship
mme
doulenques
protested
i
took
an
oath
just
now
to
tell
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
so
i
do
want
to
tell
any
stories
well
this
lady
might
be
the
same
lady
and
again
she
might
be
in
other
words
you
can
not
give
a
definite
answer
that
it
said
the
concierge
i
do
know
i
ca
swear
this
lady
is
like
the
other
lady
there
a
sort
of
family
likeness
between
them
but
at
the
moment
i
do
not
exactly
recognise
her
it
much
too
serious
mme
doulenques
would
willingly
have
continued
to
give
evidence
for
ever
and
a
day
but
the
president
cut
her
short
very
well
thank
you
he
said
and
dismissed
her
with
the
usher
turning
again
meanwhile
to
lady
beltham
will
you
kindly
tell
me
now
what
your
personal
opinion
is
as
to
the
relative
culpability
of
the
prisoner
of
course
you
understand
that
he
has
confessed
to
the
crime
and
your
answer
will
bear
chiefly
on
the
motive
that
may
have
actuated
him
lady
beltham
appeared
to
have
recovered
some
of
her
confidence
i
can
not
say
anything
definite
can
only
express
a
very
vague
feeling
about
the
matter
i
know
my
husband
was
very
and
even
violent
and
his
peremptory
temper
predisposed
him
to
positive
convictions
he
maintained
what
he
considered
his
rights
at
all
times
and
against
all
comers
if
as
the
prisoner
says
there
was
a
heated
discussion
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
my
husband
did
make
use
of
arguments
that
might
have
provoked
anger
the
president
gently
gave
a
clearer
turn
to
the
phrase
she
used
so
in
your
opinion
the
prisoner
version
of
the
story
is
quite
permissible
you
admit
that
lord
beltham
and
his
murderer
may
have
had
a
heated
discussion
as
a
consequence
of
which
gurn
committed
this
crime
that
is
your
honest
belief
yes
lady
beltham
answered
trying
to
control
her
voice
i
believe
that
that
may
be
what
took
place
and
then
it
is
the
only
way
in
which
i
can
find
the
least
excuse
for
the
crime
this
man
gurn
committed
the
president
picked
up
the
word
in
astonishment
do
you
want
to
find
excuses
for
him
madame
lady
beltham
stood
erect
and
looked
at
the
president
it
is
written
that
to
pardon
is
the
first
duty
of
good
christians
it
is
true
that
i
have
mourned
my
husband
but
the
punishment
of
his
murderer
will
not
dry
my
tears
i
ought
to
forgive
him
bow
beneath
the
burden
that
is
laid
upon
my
soul
and
i
do
forgive
him
ghastly
pale
gurn
was
staring
at
lady
beltham
from
the
dock
and
this
time
his
emotion
was
so
visible
that
all
the
jury
noticed
it
the
president
held
a
brief
colloquy
with
his
colleagues
asked
the
prisoner
counsel
whether
he
desired
to
put
any
questions
to
the
witness
and
receiving
a
reply
in
the
negative
dismissed
lady
beltham
with
a
word
of
thanks
and
announced
that
the
court
would
adjourn
immediately
a
hum
of
conversation
broke
out
in
the
warm
and
sunny
court
barristers
in
their
robes
moved
from
group
to
group
criticising
explaining
prophesying
and
in
their
seats
the
world
of
beauty
and
fashion
bowed
and
smiled
and
gossiped
she
uncommonly
pretty
this
lady
beltham
one
young
lawyer
said
and
she
got
a
way
of
answering
questions
without
compromising
herself
and
yet
without
throwing
blame
on
the
prisoner
that
is
uncommonly
clever
you
are
all
alike
you
men
said
a
pretty
perfectly
dressed
woman
in
mocking
tones
if
a
woman
is
young
and
has
got
a
hump
on
her
back
and
has
a
charming
voice
your
sympathies
are
with
her
at
once
oh
yes
they
are
now
shall
i
tell
you
what
your
lady
beltham
really
is
well
she
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
barnstormer
she
knew
well
enough
how
to
get
on
the
soft
side
of
the
judge
who
was
quite
ridiculously
amiable
to
her
and
to
capture
the
sympathy
of
the
court
i
think
it
was
outrageous
to
declare
that
she
had
married
a
man
who
was
too
old
for
her
and
to
say
that
she
felt
nothing
but
esteem
for
him
there
an
admission
the
young
barrister
laughed
eh
and
de
are
played
out
eh
on
another
bench
a
little
further
away
a
man
with
a
highly
intelligent
face
was
talking
animatedly
bosh
your
lady
beltham
is
anything
you
like
what
do
i
care
for
lady
beltham
i
shall
never
play
women
parts
shall
i
she
does
not
stand
for
anything
but
gurn
now
there
a
type
if
you
like
what
an
interesting
characteristic
face
he
has
the
head
of
the
assassin
of
genius
with
perfect
mastery
of
self
implacable
cruel
malignant
a
torquemada
of
a
man
your
enthusiasm
is
running
away
with
you
someone
laughed
i
do
care
it
is
so
seldom
one
comes
across
figures
in
a
city
that
really
are
figures
entities
that
man
is
not
an
assassin
he
is
the
assassin
the
type
two
ladies
sitting
close
to
this
enthusiast
had
been
listening
keenly
to
this
diatribe
do
you
know
who
that
is
one
whispered
to
the
other
that
is
valgrand
the
actor
and
they
turned
their
lorgnettes
on
the
actor
who
was
waxing
more
animated
every
moment
a
bell
rang
and
heralded
by
the
usher
proclaiming
silence
the
judges
returned
to
the
bench
and
the
jury
to
their
box
the
president
cast
an
eagle
eye
over
the
court
compelling
silence
and
then
resumed
the
proceedings
next
witness
call
m
juve
xxix
verdict
and
sentence
once
more
a
wave
of
sensation
ran
through
the
court
there
was
not
a
single
person
present
who
had
not
heard
of
juve
and
his
wonderful
exploits
or
who
did
not
regard
him
as
a
kind
of
hero
all
leaned
forward
to
watch
him
as
he
followed
the
usher
to
the
wholly
unaffected
in
manner
and
not
seeking
to
make
any
capital
out
of
his
popularity
indeed
he
seemed
rather
to
be
uneasy
almost
nervous
as
one
of
the
oldest
pressmen
present
remarked
audibly
he
took
the
oath
and
the
president
of
the
court
addressed
him
in
friendly
tones
you
are
quite
familiar
with
procedure
juve
which
would
you
prefer
that
i
should
interrogate
you
or
that
i
should
leave
you
to
tell
your
story
in
your
own
way
you
know
how
important
it
is
for
it
is
you
who
are
so
to
speak
the
originator
of
the
trial
inasmuch
as
it
was
your
great
detective
skill
that
brought
about
the
arrest
of
the
criminal
after
it
had
also
discovered
his
crime
since
you
are
so
kind
sir
juve
answered
i
will
make
my
statement
first
and
then
be
ready
to
answer
any
questions
that
may
be
put
to
me
by
yourself
or
by
counsel
for
the
defence
juve
turned
to
the
dock
and
fixed
his
piercing
eyes
on
the
impassive
face
of
gurn
who
met
it
unflinchingly
juve
shrugged
his
shoulders
slightly
and
turning
half
round
to
the
jury
began
his
statement
he
did
not
propose
he
said
to
recite
the
story
of
his
enquiries
which
had
resulted
in
the
arrest
of
gurn
for
this
had
been
set
forth
fully
in
the
indictment
and
the
jury
had
also
seen
his
depositions
at
the
original
examination
he
had
nothing
to
add
to
or
to
subtract
from
his
previous
evidence
he
merely
asked
for
the
jury
particular
attention
for
although
he
was
adducing
nothing
new
in
the
case
actually
before
them
he
had
some
unexpected
disclosures
to
make
about
the
prisoner
personal
culpability
the
first
point
which
he
desired
to
emphasise
was
that
human
intelligence
should
hesitate
before
no
improbability
however
improbable
provided
that
some
explanation
was
humanly
conceivable
and
no
definite
material
object
rendered
the
improbability
an
impossibility
his
whole
statement
would
be
based
on
the
principle
that
the
probable
is
incontestable
and
true
until
proof
of
the
contrary
has
been
established
gentlemen
he
went
on
hitherto
the
police
have
remained
impotent
and
justice
has
been
disarmed
in
presence
of
a
number
of
serious
cases
of
crime
committed
recently
and
still
unsolved
let
me
recall
these
cases
to
your
memory
they
were
the
murder
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
at
her
château
of
beaulieu
the
robberies
from
mme
van
den
rosen
and
the
princess
sonia
danidoff
the
murder
of
dollon
the
former
steward
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
when
on
his
way
from
the
neighbourhood
of
to
paris
in
obedience
to
a
summons
sent
him
by
germain
fuselier
and
lastly
the
murder
of
lord
beltham
prior
to
the
cases
just
enumerated
for
which
the
prisoner
in
the
dock
is
at
this
moment
standing
his
trial
gentlemen
i
have
to
say
that
all
these
cases
the
beltham
langrune
and
dollon
murders
and
the
burglaries
are
absolutely
and
indisputably
to
be
attributed
to
one
and
the
same
individual
to
that
man
standing
there
gurn
having
made
this
extraordinary
assertion
juve
again
turned
round
towards
the
prisoner
that
mysterious
person
appeared
to
be
keenly
interested
in
what
the
detective
said
but
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
say
whether
he
was
merely
surprised
or
not
rather
perturbed
and
excited
as
well
juve
hushed
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
the
murmur
that
ran
round
the
court
and
resumed
his
address
my
assertion
that
gurn
is
the
sole
person
responsible
for
all
these
crimes
has
surprised
you
gentlemen
but
i
have
proofs
which
must
i
think
convince
you
i
will
not
go
into
the
details
of
each
of
those
cases
for
the
newspapers
have
made
you
quite
familiar
with
them
but
i
will
be
as
brief
and
as
lucid
as
i
can
my
first
point
gentlemen
is
this
the
murderer
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
and
the
man
who
robbed
mme
van
den
rosen
and
princess
sonia
danidoff
are
one
and
the
same
person
that
is
shown
beyond
dispute
by
tests
made
in
the
two
cases
with
a
bertillon
dynamometer
an
instrument
of
the
nicest
exactitude
which
proved
that
the
same
individual
operated
in
both
cases
that
is
one
point
made
good
and
next
the
man
who
robbed
mme
van
den
rosen
and
princess
sonia
is
gurn
that
is
proved
to
equal
demonstration
by
the
fact
that
the
burglar
burned
his
hand
while
engaged
upon
his
crime
and
that
gurn
has
a
scar
on
his
hand
which
betrays
him
as
the
criminal
the
scar
is
faint
now
perhaps
but
i
can
testify
that
it
was
very
obvious
at
the
time
of
a
disturbance
which
occurred
at
a
low
café
named
the
pig
where
accompanied
by
detective
lemaroy
who
is
still
in
hospital
for
treatment
for
injuries
received
on
that
occasion
i
attempted
and
failed
to
arrest
this
man
gurn
thus
gentlemen
i
prove
that
the
langrune
and
danidoff
cases
are
the
work
of
but
one
man
and
that
man
gurn
i
come
to
another
point
as
you
know
the
murder
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
was
attended
by
some
strange
circumstances
at
the
inquest
it
was
proved
that
the
murderer
most
probably
got
into
the
house
from
outside
opening
the
front
door
with
a
skeleton
key
and
that
he
obtained
admission
into
the
bedroom
of
the
marquise
not
by
burglarious
means
i
lay
insistence
upon
that
but
by
the
simple
means
of
her
having
opened
the
door
to
him
which
she
did
on
the
strength
of
his
name
and
finally
that
if
robbery
was
the
motive
of
the
crime
the
nature
of
the
robbery
remained
a
mystery
now
i
have
ascertained
gentlemen
and
if
as
i
shall
ask
you
presently
you
decide
to
have
an
adjournment
and
a
supplementary
investigation
i
shall
be
able
to
prove
two
important
facts
the
first
is
that
the
marquise
had
in
her
possession
a
lottery
ticket
which
had
just
won
a
large
first
prize
this
ticket
had
been
sent
to
her
by
etienne
rambert
this
ticket
was
not
found
at
the
time
but
it
was
subsequently
traced
to
a
person
who
for
the
moment
has
utterly
disappeared
who
declared
that
it
was
given
to
him
by
etienne
rambert
and
it
is
further
noteworthy
that
etienne
rambert
seemed
to
be
in
greater
funds
from
that
time
the
second
fact
i
have
ascertained
is
that
although
etienne
rambert
pretended
to
get
into
a
carriage
of
a
slow
train
at
the
gare
he
most
certainly
was
not
in
that
train
between
vierzon
and
limoges
i
can
if
you
wish
call
a
witness
who
inspected
all
the
compartments
of
that
carriage
and
can
prove
that
he
was
not
there
the
probable
almost
certain
inference
is
that
etienne
rambert
got
into
that
slow
train
at
the
gare
for
the
definite
purpose
of
establishing
an
alibi
and
then
got
out
of
it
on
the
other
side
and
entered
an
express
that
was
going
in
the
same
direction
and
in
front
of
the
slow
train
you
may
remember
that
it
was
shown
that
all
trains
stopped
at
the
mouth
of
the
verrières
tunnel
near
beaulieu
and
that
it
was
possible
for
a
man
to
get
out
of
the
express
commit
the
crime
and
then
return
i
would
remind
you
of
the
footprints
found
on
the
embankment
and
get
into
the
slow
train
which
followed
the
express
at
an
interval
of
three
hours
and
a
half
and
get
out
of
that
train
at
verrières
station
the
passenger
who
did
that
was
the
criminal
and
it
was
etienne
rambert
as
i
have
already
proved
that
it
was
gurn
who
murdered
the
marquise
de
langrune
it
seems
to
follow
necessarily
that
etienne
rambert
must
be
gurn
juve
paused
to
make
sure
that
the
jury
had
followed
his
deductions
and
taken
all
his
points
he
proceeded
in
the
most
tense
hush
we
have
just
identified
gurn
with
rambert
and
proved
that
is
guilty
of
the
beltham
and
langrune
murders
and
the
robbery
from
mme
van
den
rosen
and
princess
sonia
danidoff
there
remains
the
murder
of
the
steward
dollon
gentlemen
when
gurn
was
arrested
on
the
single
charge
of
the
murder
of
lord
beltham
you
will
readily
believe
that
his
one
fear
was
that
all
these
other
crimes
for
which
i
have
just
shown
him
to
be
responsible
might
be
brought
up
against
him
i
was
just
then
on
the
very
point
of
finding
out
the
truth
but
i
had
not
yet
done
so
a
single
link
was
missing
in
the
chain
which
would
connect
gurn
with
rambert
and
identify
the
murderer
of
lord
beltham
as
the
author
of
the
other
crimes
that
link
was
some
common
clue
or
better
still
some
object
belonging
to
the
murderer
of
lord
beltham
which
had
been
forgotten
and
left
on
the
scene
of
the
langrune
murder
that
object
i
found
it
was
a
fragment
of
a
map
picked
up
in
a
field
near
the
château
of
beaulieu
in
the
path
which
etienne
rambert
must
have
followed
from
the
railway
line
it
was
a
fragment
cut
out
of
a
large
ordnance
map
and
the
rest
of
the
map
i
found
in
gurn
rooms
thereby
identifying
gurn
with
rambert
gentlemen
the
fragment
of
map
which
was
picked
up
in
the
field
was
left
in
the
custody
of
the
steward
dollon
that
unfortunate
man
was
summoned
to
paris
by
germain
fuselier
there
was
only
one
person
who
had
any
interest
in
preventing
dollon
from
coming
and
that
person
was
gurn
or
it
would
be
better
to
say
and
you
know
that
dollon
was
killed
before
he
reached
germain
fuselier
is
it
necessary
to
declare
that
it
was
gurn
who
killed
him
juve
said
the
last
words
in
tones
of
such
earnest
and
solemn
denunciation
that
the
truth
of
them
seemed
beyond
all
doubt
and
yet
he
read
incredulous
surprise
in
the
attitude
of
the
jury
from
the
body
of
the
court
too
a
murmur
rose
that
was
not
sympathetic
juve
realised
that
the
sheer
audacity
of
his
theory
must
come
as
a
shock
and
he
knew
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
convince
anyone
who
had
not
followed
every
detail
of
the
case
as
he
himself
had
done
gentlemen
he
said
i
know
that
my
assertions
about
the
multiple
crimes
of
this
man
gurn
must
fill
you
with
amazement
that
does
not
dismay
me
there
is
one
other
name
which
i
must
mention
perhaps
to
silence
your
objections
perhaps
to
show
the
vast
importance
i
attach
to
the
deductions
which
i
have
just
been
privileged
to
detail
to
you
this
is
the
last
thing
i
have
to
say
the
man
who
has
been
capable
of
assuming
in
turn
the
guise
of
gurn
and
of
etienne
rambert
and
of
the
man
of
fashion
at
the
royal
palace
hotel
who
has
had
the
genius
to
devise
and
to
accomplish
such
terrible
crimes
in
incredible
circumstances
and
to
combine
audacity
with
skill
and
a
conception
of
evil
with
a
pretence
of
respectability
who
has
been
able
to
play
the
proteus
eluding
all
the
efforts
of
the
police
this
man
i
say
ought
not
to
be
called
gurn
he
is
and
can
be
no
other
than
fantômas
the
detective
suddenly
broke
off
from
his
long
statement
and
the
syllables
of
the
melodramatic
name
seemed
to
echo
through
the
court
and
taken
up
by
all
those
present
to
swell
again
into
a
dread
murmur
fantômas
he
is
fantômas
for
a
space
of
minutes
judges
and
jury
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
their
own
reflections
and
then
the
president
of
the
court
made
an
abrupt
gesture
of
violent
dissent
juve
you
have
just
enunciated
such
astounding
facts
and
elaborated
such
an
appalling
indictment
against
this
man
gurn
that
i
have
no
doubt
the
public
prosecutor
will
ask
for
a
supplementary
examination
which
this
court
will
be
happy
to
grant
if
he
considers
your
arguments
worth
consideration
but
are
they
i
will
submit
three
objections
juve
bowed
coldly
first
of
all
juve
do
you
believe
that
a
man
could
assume
disguise
with
the
cleverness
that
you
have
just
represented
etienne
rambert
is
a
man
of
sixty
gurn
is
rambert
is
an
elderly
man
slow
of
movement
and
the
man
who
robbed
princess
sonia
danidoff
was
a
nimble
very
active
man
i
have
anticipated
that
objection
sir
juve
said
with
a
smile
by
saying
that
gurn
is
fantômas
nothing
is
impossible
for
fantômas
suppose
that
is
true
said
the
president
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
but
what
have
you
to
say
to
this
you
charge
etienne
rambert
with
the
murder
of
mme
de
langrune
but
do
you
not
know
that
etienne
rambert
son
charles
rambert
who
according
to
the
generally
received
and
most
plausible
opinion
was
the
real
murderer
of
the
marquise
committed
suicide
from
remorse
if
etienne
rambert
was
the
guilty
party
charles
rambert
would
not
have
taken
his
own
life
juve
voice
shook
a
little
you
would
be
quite
right
sir
if
again
it
were
not
necessary
to
add
that
etienne
rambert
is
gurn
that
is
to
say
fantômas
is
it
not
a
possible
hypothesis
that
fantômas
might
have
affected
the
mind
of
that
lad
have
suggested
to
him
that
it
was
he
who
committed
the
crime
in
a
period
of
somnambulism
and
at
last
have
urged
him
to
suicide
do
you
not
know
the
power
of
suggestion
suppose
that
also
is
true
said
the
president
with
another
vague
wave
of
his
hand
i
will
only
put
two
incontestable
facts
before
you
you
accuse
etienne
rambert
of
being
gurn
and
etienne
rambert
was
lost
in
the
wreck
of
the
you
also
accuse
gurn
of
having
murdered
dollon
and
at
the
time
that
murder
was
committed
gurn
was
in
solitary
confinement
in
the
santé
prison
this
time
the
detective
made
a
sign
as
if
of
defeat
if
i
have
waited
until
to
make
the
statement
you
have
just
listened
to
it
was
obviously
because
hitherto
i
have
had
no
absolute
proofs
but
merely
groups
of
certainties
i
spoke
because
i
could
keep
silent
no
longer
if
i
am
still
without
some
explanations
in
detail
i
am
sure
i
shall
have
them
some
day
everything
comes
to
light
sooner
or
later
and
as
to
the
two
facts
you
have
just
put
before
me
i
would
reply
that
there
is
no
proof
that
rambert
was
lost
in
the
wreck
of
the
it
has
not
been
legally
established
that
he
ever
was
on
board
that
ship
of
course
i
know
his
name
was
in
the
list
of
passengers
but
a
child
could
have
contrived
a
device
of
that
sort
besides
all
the
circumstances
attending
that
disaster
are
still
an
utter
mystery
my
belief
is
that
a
fantômas
would
be
perfectly
capable
of
causing
an
explosion
on
a
ship
and
blowing
up
a
hundred
and
fifty
people
if
thereby
he
could
dispose
of
one
of
his
identities
especially
such
a
terribly
compromising
identity
as
that
of
etienne
rambert
the
president
dismissed
the
theory
with
a
word
pure
romance
he
said
and
what
about
the
murder
of
dollon
i
should
like
further
to
remind
you
that
the
fragment
of
map
which
according
to
you
was
the
real
reason
for
this
man
death
was
found
on
his
body
and
does
not
correspond
in
the
least
with
the
hole
cut
in
the
map
you
found
in
gurn
rooms
as
for
that
juve
said
with
a
smile
the
explanation
is
obvious
if
gurn
whom
i
charge
with
the
murder
of
dollon
had
been
content
merely
to
abstract
the
real
fragment
he
would
so
to
speak
have
set
his
signature
to
the
crime
but
he
was
much
too
clever
for
that
he
was
subtle
enough
to
abstract
the
compromising
fragment
and
substitute
another
fragment
for
it
the
one
found
on
the
body
perhaps
said
the
president
that
is
possible
but
i
repeat
gurn
was
in
prison
at
the
time
true
true
said
juve
throwing
up
his
hands
i
am
prepared
to
swear
that
it
was
gurn
who
did
the
murder
but
i
can
not
yet
explain
how
he
did
it
since
he
was
in
solitary
confinement
in
the
santé
silence
fell
upon
the
court
juve
refrained
from
saying
anything
more
but
a
sarcastic
smile
curled
his
lip
have
you
anything
else
to
say
the
president
asked
after
a
pause
nothing
except
that
anything
is
possible
to
fantômas
the
president
turned
to
the
prisoner
gurn
have
you
anything
to
say
any
confession
to
make
the
jury
will
listen
to
you
gurn
rose
to
his
feet
i
do
not
understand
a
word
of
what
the
detective
has
just
been
saying
he
said
the
president
looked
at
juve
again
you
suggest
that
there
shall
be
a
supplementary
investigation
yes
have
you
any
application
to
make
on
that
subject
the
president
asked
the
public
prosecutor
no
said
the
functionary
the
witness
allegations
are
altogether
too
vague
very
well
the
court
will
deliberate
forthwith
the
judges
gathered
round
the
president
of
the
court
and
held
a
short
discussion
then
they
returned
to
their
places
and
the
president
announced
their
decision
it
was
that
after
consideration
of
the
statement
of
the
witness
juve
their
opinion
was
that
it
rested
merely
upon
hypotheses
and
their
decision
was
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
a
supplementary
enquiry
and
the
president
immediately
called
upon
the
public
prosecutor
to
address
the
court
neither
in
the
lengthy
address
of
that
functionary
nor
in
the
ensuing
address
of
maître
barberoux
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
was
the
slightest
allusion
made
to
the
fresh
facts
adduced
by
the
detective
the
theories
he
put
forward
were
so
unexpected
and
so
utterly
astonishing
that
nobody
paid
the
least
attention
to
them
then
the
sitting
was
suspended
while
the
jury
considered
their
verdict
the
judges
retired
and
guards
removed
the
prisoner
and
juve
who
had
accepted
the
dismissal
of
his
application
for
a
further
enquiry
with
perfect
equanimity
went
up
to
the
and
spoke
to
a
young
journalist
sitting
there
shall
we
go
out
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
fandor
and
when
they
were
presently
in
the
corridor
he
smote
the
young
fellow
in
a
friendly
way
on
the
shoulder
and
enquired
well
my
boy
what
do
you
say
to
all
that
jérôme
fandor
seemed
to
be
overwhelmed
you
accuse
my
father
you
really
accuse
etienne
rambert
of
being
gurn
surely
i
am
dreaming
my
dear
young
idiot
juve
growled
do
pray
understand
one
thing
i
am
not
accusing
your
father
your
real
father
but
only
the
man
who
represented
himself
to
be
your
father
just
think
if
my
contention
is
right
that
the
etienne
rambert
who
killed
the
marquise
is
gurn
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
gurn
is
not
your
father
for
he
is
only
years
of
age
he
has
merely
represented
himself
to
be
your
father
then
who
is
my
real
father
i
do
know
anything
about
that
said
the
detective
that
a
matter
we
will
look
into
one
of
these
fine
days
you
take
it
from
me
that
we
are
only
just
at
the
beginning
of
all
these
things
but
the
court
has
refused
a
supplementary
enquiry
said
juve
i
quite
expected
it
would
i
have
not
got
the
proofs
to
satisfy
the
legal
mind
and
then
too
i
had
to
hold
my
tongue
about
the
most
interesting
fact
that
i
knew
what
was
that
why
that
you
are
not
dead
charles
rambert
i
had
to
conceal
that
fact
my
boy
for
the
melancholy
reason
that
i
am
a
poor
man
and
depend
on
my
job
if
i
had
let
out
that
i
had
known
for
a
long
time
that
charles
rambert
was
alive
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
dead
and
that
i
had
known
him
first
as
jeanne
and
then
as
paul
and
yet
had
said
nothing
about
it
i
should
have
been
dismissed
from
the
service
as
sure
as
eggs
are
eggs
and
it
is
equally
certain
that
you
would
have
been
arrested
which
is
precisely
what
i
do
not
wish
to
happen
in
tense
silence
the
foreman
of
the
jury
rose
in
the
presence
of
god
and
man
and
upon
my
honour
and
my
conscience
i
declare
that
the
answer
of
a
majority
of
the
jury
is
to
all
the
questions
submitted
to
them
then
he
sat
down
he
had
made
no
mention
of
extenuating
circumstances
the
words
of
the
fatal
verdict
fell
like
a
knell
in
the
silent
court
of
assize
and
many
a
face
went
white
have
you
anything
to
say
before
sentence
is
passed
nothing
gurn
replied
in
rapid
tones
the
president
read
the
formal
pronouncement
of
the
court
it
seemed
horribly
long
and
unintelligible
but
presently
the
president
voice
became
slower
as
it
reached
the
fatal
words
there
was
a
second
pause
and
then
he
reached
the
point
the
sentence
on
the
prisoner
gurn
is
death
and
almost
simultaneously
he
gave
the
order
guards
take
the
condemned
away
juve
who
had
returned
to
court
with
fandor
spoke
to
the
young
journalist
he
exclaimed
i
know
what
pluck
is
that
man
is
a
truly
remarkable
man
he
never
turned
a
hair
xxx
an
assignation
the
final
curtain
had
fallen
upon
the
first
performance
of
the
new
drama
at
the
grand
treteau
the
night
had
been
one
long
triumph
for
valgrand
and
although
it
was
very
late
the
baronne
de
vibray
who
plumed
herself
on
being
the
great
tragedian
dearest
friend
had
made
her
way
behind
the
scenes
to
lavish
praise
and
congratulations
on
him
and
have
a
little
triumph
of
her
own
in
presenting
her
friends
to
the
hero
of
the
hour
in
vain
had
charlot
the
old
dresser
tried
to
prevent
her
invasion
of
his
he
was
not
proof
against
her
perseverance
and
ere
long
she
had
swept
into
the
room
with
the
proud
smile
of
a
general
entering
a
conquered
town
the
comte
de
baral
a
tall
young
man
with
a
single
eyeglass
followed
close
in
her
wake
will
you
please
announce
us
he
said
to
the
dresser
charlot
hesitated
a
moment
in
surprise
then
broke
into
voluble
explanations
valgrand
is
not
here
yet
what
did
you
know
why
at
the
end
of
the
performance
the
minister
of
public
instruction
sent
for
him
to
congratulate
him
that
a
tremendous
honour
and
it
the
second
time
it
has
been
paid
to
m
valgrand
meanwhile
the
other
two
ladies
in
the
party
were
roaming
about
the
mme
simone
holbord
wife
of
a
colonel
of
the
marines
who
had
just
covered
himself
with
distinction
in
the
congo
and
the
comtesse
marcelline
de
baral
how
thrilling
an
actor
is
exclaimed
mme
holbord
inspecting
everything
in
the
room
through
her
glass
just
look
at
these
darling
little
brushes
i
suppose
he
uses
those
in
making
up
and
oh
my
dear
there
are
actually
three
kinds
of
rouge
the
comtesse
de
baral
was
fascinated
by
the
photographs
adorning
the
walls
the
admirable
valgrand
from
a
comrade
she
read
in
tones
come
and
look
dear
it
is
signed
by
sarah
bernhardt
and
listen
to
this
one
buenos
ayres
at
melbourne
and
new
york
wherever
i
am
i
hear
the
praises
of
my
friend
valgrand
something
like
a
said
mme
holbord
i
expect
he
belongs
to
the
comédie
française
colonel
holbord
interrupted
calling
to
his
wife
simone
come
and
listen
to
what
our
friend
de
baral
is
telling
me
it
is
really
very
curious
the
young
woman
approached
and
the
comte
began
again
for
her
benefit
you
have
come
back
too
recently
from
the
congo
to
be
up
to
date
with
all
our
paris
happenings
and
so
you
will
not
have
noticed
this
little
touch
but
in
the
part
that
he
created
valgrand
made
himself
up
exactly
like
gurn
the
man
who
murdered
lord
beltham
gurn
said
mme
holbord
to
whom
the
name
did
not
convey
much
oh
yes
i
think
i
read
about
that
the
murderer
escaped
did
he
well
they
took
a
long
time
to
find
him
the
comte
de
baral
replied
as
usual
the
police
were
giving
up
all
hope
of
finding
him
when
one
day
or
rather
one
night
they
did
find
him
and
arrested
him
and
where
do
you
suppose
that
was
why
with
lady
beltham
yes
really
in
her
own
house
at
neuilly
impossible
cried
simone
holbord
poor
woman
what
an
awful
shock
for
her
lady
beltham
is
a
brave
dignified
and
truly
charitable
woman
said
the
comtesse
de
baral
she
simply
worshipped
her
husband
and
yet
she
pleaded
warmly
for
mercy
for
the
murderer
though
she
did
not
succeed
in
getting
it
what
a
dreadful
thing
said
simone
holbord
perfunctorily
her
attention
was
wandering
to
all
the
other
attractions
in
this
attractive
room
a
pile
of
letters
was
lying
on
a
and
the
reckless
young
woman
began
to
look
at
the
envelopes
just
look
at
this
pile
of
letters
she
cried
how
funny
every
one
of
them
in
a
woman
hand
i
suppose
valgrand
gets
all
sorts
of
offers
colonel
holbord
went
on
talking
to
the
comte
de
baral
in
a
corner
of
the
room
i
am
enormously
interested
in
what
you
tell
me
what
happened
then
well
this
wretch
gurn
was
recognised
by
the
police
as
he
was
leaving
lady
beltham
and
was
arrested
and
put
in
prison
the
trial
came
on
at
the
court
of
assize
about
six
weeks
ago
all
paris
went
to
it
of
course
including
myself
this
man
gurn
is
a
brute
but
a
strange
brute
rather
difficult
to
define
he
swore
that
he
had
killed
lord
beltham
after
a
quarrel
practically
for
the
sake
of
robbing
him
but
i
had
a
strong
impression
that
he
was
lying
but
why
else
should
he
have
committed
the
murder
the
comte
de
baral
shrugged
his
shoulders
nobody
knows
he
said
politics
perhaps
nihilism
or
perhaps
again
love
there
was
one
fact
or
coincidence
worth
noting
when
lady
beltham
came
home
from
the
transvaal
after
the
war
during
which
by
the
way
she
did
splendid
work
among
the
sick
and
wounded
she
sailed
by
the
same
boat
that
was
taking
gurn
to
england
gurn
also
was
a
bit
of
a
popular
hero
just
then
he
had
volunteered
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
and
came
back
with
a
sergeant
stripes
and
a
medal
for
distinguished
conduct
can
gurn
and
lady
beltham
have
met
and
got
to
know
each
other
it
is
certain
that
the
lady
behaviour
during
the
trial
lent
itself
to
comment
if
not
exactly
to
scandal
she
had
odd
collapses
in
the
presence
of
the
murderer
collapses
which
were
accounted
for
in
very
various
ways
some
people
said
that
she
was
half
out
of
her
mind
with
grief
at
the
loss
of
her
husband
others
said
that
if
she
was
mad
it
was
over
someone
over
this
vulgar
criminal
martyr
or
accomplice
perhaps
they
even
went
so
far
as
to
allege
that
lady
beltham
had
an
intrigue
with
gurn
come
come
the
colonel
protested
a
great
lady
like
lady
beltham
so
religious
and
so
austere
absurd
people
say
all
sorts
of
things
said
the
comte
de
baral
vaguely
he
turned
to
another
subject
anyhow
the
case
caused
a
tremendous
sensation
gurn
condemnation
to
death
was
very
popular
and
the
case
was
so
typically
parisian
that
our
friend
valgrand
knowing
that
he
was
going
to
create
the
part
of
the
murderer
in
this
tragedy
followed
every
phase
of
the
gurn
trial
closely
studied
the
man
in
detail
and
literally
identified
himself
with
him
in
this
character
it
was
a
shrewd
idea
you
noticed
the
sensation
when
he
came
on
the
stage
yes
i
did
said
the
colonel
i
wondered
what
the
exclamations
from
all
over
the
house
meant
try
to
find
a
portrait
of
gurn
in
some
one
of
the
illustrated
papers
said
the
comte
and
compare
it
with
ah
i
think
this
is
valgrand
coming
the
baronne
de
vibray
had
tired
of
her
conversation
with
the
old
dresser
charlot
and
had
left
him
to
take
up
her
stand
outside
the
where
she
greeted
with
nods
and
smiles
the
other
actors
and
actresses
as
they
hurried
by
on
their
way
home
and
listened
to
the
sounds
at
the
end
of
the
passage
presently
a
voice
became
distinguishable
the
voice
of
valgrand
singing
a
refrain
from
a
musical
comedy
the
baronne
de
vibray
hurried
to
meet
him
with
both
hands
outstretched
and
led
him
into
his
let
me
present
m
valgrand
she
exclaimed
and
then
presented
the
two
young
women
to
the
bowing
actor
comtesse
marcelline
de
baral
mme
holbord
pardon
me
ladies
for
keeping
you
waiting
the
actor
said
i
was
deep
in
conversation
with
the
minister
he
was
so
charming
so
kind
he
turned
to
the
baronne
de
vibray
he
did
me
the
honour
to
offer
me
a
cigarette
a
relic
charlot
charlot
you
must
put
this
cigarette
in
the
little
box
where
all
my
treasures
are
it
is
very
full
already
valgrand
said
charlot
deprecatingly
we
must
not
keep
you
long
the
baronne
de
vibray
murmured
you
must
be
very
tired
valgrand
passed
a
weary
hand
across
his
brow
positively
exhausted
then
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
the
company
what
did
you
think
of
me
a
chorus
of
eulogy
sprang
from
every
lip
splendid
wonderful
the
very
perfection
of
art
no
but
really
protested
valgrand
swelling
with
satisfied
vanity
tell
me
candidly
was
it
really
good
you
really
were
wonderful
could
not
have
been
better
the
baronne
de
vibray
exclaimed
enthusiastically
and
the
crowd
of
worshippers
endorsed
every
word
until
the
artist
was
convinced
that
their
praise
was
quite
sincere
how
i
have
worked
he
exclaimed
do
you
know
when
rehearsals
began
ask
charlot
if
this
is
true
the
piece
simply
did
exist
simply
did
exist
charlot
corroborated
him
like
an
echo
did
exist
valgrand
repeated
not
even
my
part
it
was
insignificant
flat
so
i
took
the
author
aside
and
i
said
my
boy
i
tell
you
what
you
must
do
you
know
the
lawyer
speech
absurd
what
am
i
to
do
while
he
is
delivering
it
i
make
the
speech
for
my
own
defence
and
i
get
something
out
of
it
and
the
prison
scene
just
fancy
he
had
shoved
a
parson
into
that
i
said
to
frantz
the
parson
out
my
boy
what
the
dickens
am
i
to
do
while
he
is
preaching
simply
nothing
at
all
it
absurd
give
his
speech
to
me
i
preach
to
myself
and
there
you
are
i
do
want
to
boast
but
really
i
did
it
all
and
it
was
a
success
eh
again
the
chorus
broke
out
to
be
stopped
by
valgrand
who
was
contemplating
his
reflection
in
a
mirror
and
my
colonel
do
you
know
the
story
of
my
i
hear
they
were
talking
about
it
all
over
the
house
am
i
like
gurn
what
do
you
think
you
saw
him
quite
close
at
the
trial
comte
what
do
you
think
the
resemblance
is
perfectly
amazing
said
the
comte
de
baral
with
perfect
truth
the
actor
stroked
his
face
mechanically
a
new
idea
struck
him
my
beard
is
a
real
one
he
exclaimed
i
let
it
grow
on
purpose
i
hardly
had
to
make
myself
up
at
all
i
am
the
same
build
the
same
type
same
profile
it
was
ridiculously
easy
give
me
a
lock
of
hair
from
your
beard
for
a
locket
said
the
baronne
de
vibray
impudently
valgrand
looked
at
her
and
heaved
a
profound
sigh
not
yet
not
yet
dear
lady
i
am
infinitely
sorry
but
not
yet
a
little
later
on
perhaps
wait
for
the
hundredth
performance
i
must
have
one
too
said
simone
holbord
and
valgrand
with
great
dignity
replied
i
will
put
your
name
down
for
one
madame
but
the
comte
de
baral
had
looked
furtively
at
his
watch
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
my
good
people
it
is
most
horribly
late
and
our
great
artiste
must
be
overcome
with
sleep
forthwith
they
all
prepared
to
depart
in
spite
of
the
actor
courteous
protests
that
he
could
not
hear
of
letting
them
go
so
soon
they
lingered
at
the
door
for
a
few
minutes
in
eager
animated
conversation
shaking
hands
and
exchanging
farewells
and
thanks
and
congratulations
then
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
died
away
along
the
corridors
and
the
baronne
de
vibray
and
her
friends
left
the
theatre
valgrand
turned
back
into
his
and
locked
the
door
then
dropped
into
the
low
and
comfortable
chair
that
was
set
before
his
he
remained
there
resting
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
sat
up
and
threw
a
whimsical
glance
at
his
dresser
who
was
putting
out
his
ordinary
clothes
hang
it
all
charlot
what
exhaustion
the
mere
sight
of
such
jewels
as
those
enchanting
women
would
wake
one
from
the
dead
charlot
shrugged
his
shoulders
will
you
never
be
serious
m
valgrand
heavens
i
hope
not
exclaimed
the
actor
i
hope
not
for
if
there
is
one
thing
of
which
one
never
tires
here
below
it
is
woman
the
peerless
rainbow
that
illuminates
this
vale
of
tears
you
are
very
poetical
the
dresser
remarked
i
am
a
lover
in
love
with
love
oh
love
love
and
in
my
time
you
know
he
made
a
sweeping
comprehensive
gesture
and
came
back
abruptly
to
mundane
affairs
come
help
me
to
dress
charlot
offered
him
a
bundle
of
letters
which
valgrand
took
with
careless
hand
he
looked
at
the
envelopes
one
after
another
hugely
amused
violet
ink
and
monograms
and
coronets
and
perfume
say
charlot
is
this
a
proposal
what
do
you
bet
you
never
have
anything
else
the
dresser
grumbled
except
bills
do
you
bet
if
you
insist
i
bet
it
is
a
bill
then
you
will
win
said
charlot
done
cried
valgrand
listen
and
he
began
to
declaim
the
letter
aloud
wondrous
genius
a
flower
but
now
unclosing
got
it
charlot
another
of
them
he
tore
open
another
envelope
photograph
enclosed
and
will
i
send
it
back
if
the
original
is
not
to
my
fancy
he
flung
himself
back
in
his
chair
to
laugh
where
is
my
collar
he
picked
up
a
third
envelope
what
will
you
bet
that
this
violet
envelope
does
not
contain
another
tribute
to
my
fatal
beauty
i
bet
it
is
another
bill
said
the
dresser
but
you
are
sure
to
win
i
have
valgrand
replied
and
again
declaimed
the
written
words
you
promise
to
be
discreet
and
true
you
shall
never
regret
it
does
one
ever
regret
it
even
if
one
does
not
keep
one
promises
at
lovers
perjuries
charlot
quoted
drunken
promises
valgrand
retorted
by
the
way
i
am
dying
for
a
drink
give
me
a
whisky
and
soda
he
got
up
and
moved
to
the
table
on
which
charlot
had
set
decanters
and
glasses
and
was
about
to
take
the
glass
the
dresser
offered
him
when
a
tap
on
the
door
brought
the
conversation
to
a
sudden
stop
the
actor
frowned
he
did
not
want
to
be
bothered
by
more
visitors
but
curiosity
got
the
better
of
his
annoyance
and
he
told
charlot
to
see
who
it
was
charlot
went
to
the
door
and
peered
through
a
narrow
opening
at
the
thoughtless
intruder
fancy
making
all
this
bother
over
a
letter
he
growled
urgent
of
course
they
always
are
urgent
and
he
shut
the
door
on
the
messenger
and
gave
the
letter
to
valgrand
a
woman
brought
it
he
said
valgrand
looked
at
it
h
mourning
will
you
bet
charlot
deep
mourning
said
charlot
then
i
bet
it
is
a
declaration
i
expect
you
will
win
again
for
very
likely
it
is
a
begging
letter
black
edges
stir
compassion
valgrand
was
reading
the
letter
carelessly
to
begin
with
then
with
deep
attention
he
reached
the
signature
at
the
end
and
then
read
it
through
again
aloud
this
time
punctuating
his
reading
with
flippant
comments
creating
the
part
of
the
criminal
in
the
tragedy
you
made
yourself
up
into
a
most
marvellous
likeness
of
gurn
the
man
who
murdered
lord
beltham
come
at
two
your
to
rue
messier
take
care
not
to
be
seen
but
come
someone
who
loves
you
is
waiting
for
you
there
and
it
is
signed
said
the
dresser
that
my
boy
i
not
going
to
tell
you
said
valgrand
and
he
put
the
letter
carefully
into
his
why
man
what
are
you
up
to
he
added
as
the
dresser
came
up
to
him
to
take
his
clothes
up
to
the
servant
exclaimed
i
am
only
helping
you
to
get
your
things
off
idiot
laughed
valgrand
did
you
understand
give
me
my
black
tie
and
villain
coat
again
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
you
charlot
asked
with
some
uneasiness
surely
you
are
not
thinking
of
going
not
going
why
in
the
whole
of
my
career
as
amorist
i
have
never
had
such
an
opportunity
before
it
may
be
a
hoax
take
my
word
for
it
i
know
better
things
like
this
are
hoaxes
besides
i
know
the
the
lady
she
has
often
been
pointed
out
to
me
and
at
the
trial
by
jove
charlot
she
is
the
most
enchanting
woman
in
the
world
strangely
lovely
infinitely
distinguished
absolutely
fascinating
you
are
raving
like
a
schoolboy
so
much
the
better
for
me
why
i
was
half
dead
with
fatigue
and
now
i
am
myself
again
be
quick
booby
my
hat
time
is
getting
on
where
is
it
where
is
what
the
bewildered
charlot
asked
why
this
place
valgrand
answered
irritably
this
rue
messier
look
it
up
in
the
directory
valgrand
stamped
impatiently
up
and
down
the
room
while
charlot
hurriedly
turned
over
the
pages
of
the
directory
muttering
the
syllables
at
the
top
of
each
as
he
ran
through
them
in
alphabetical
order
j
k
l
m
ma
me
why
valgrand
what
the
matter
why
it
is
the
street
where
the
prison
is
the
santé
where
gurn
is
in
the
condemned
cell
valgrand
cocked
his
hat
rakishly
on
one
side
and
i
have
an
assignation
at
the
prison
not
exactly
but
not
far
off
right
opposite
yes
number
must
be
right
opposite
right
opposite
the
prison
valgrand
exclaimed
gaily
the
choice
of
the
spot
and
the
desire
to
see
me
in
my
costume
as
gurn
are
evidence
of
a
positive
refinement
in
sensation
see
the
lady
and
i
the
counterpart
of
gurn
and
right
opposite
the
real
gurn
in
his
cell
quick
man
my
cloak
my
cane
do
think
sir
charlot
protested
it
is
absolutely
absurd
a
man
like
you
a
man
like
me
valgrand
roared
would
keep
an
appointment
like
this
if
he
had
to
walk
on
his
head
to
get
there
and
carolling
gaily
valgrand
strode
down
the
corridor
charlot
was
accustomed
to
these
wild
vagaries
on
his
master
part
for
valgrand
was
the
most
daring
and
inveterate
rake
it
is
possible
to
imagine
but
while
he
was
tidying
up
the
litter
in
the
room
after
valgrand
had
left
him
the
dresser
shook
his
head
what
a
pity
it
is
and
he
such
a
great
artiste
these
women
will
make
an
absolute
fool
of
him
why
he
has
even
taken
his
gloves
or
his
scarf
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
the
looked
in
can
i
turn
out
the
lights
he
enquired
has
valgrand
gone
yes
said
the
dresser
absently
he
has
gone
a
great
night
said
the
have
you
seen
the
last
edition
of
the
the
eleven
edition
there
a
notice
of
us
already
the
papers
do
lose
any
time
nowadays
they
say
it
is
a
great
success
let
look
at
it
said
the
dresser
and
glancing
through
the
notice
added
yes
that
quite
true
valgrand
has
achieved
his
finest
triumph
in
his
last
creation
he
looked
casually
through
the
newspaper
and
suddenly
broke
into
a
sharp
exclamation
good
heavens
it
ca
be
possible
what
the
matter
the
enquired
charlot
pointed
a
shaking
finger
to
another
column
read
that
jean
read
that
surely
i
am
mistaken
the
peered
over
charlot
shoulder
at
the
indicated
passage
i
do
see
anything
in
that
it
that
gurn
affair
again
yes
he
is
to
be
executed
at
daybreak
on
the
eighteenth
but
that
is
this
morning
presently
charlot
exclaimed
may
be
said
the
indifferently
yes
last
night
was
the
seventeenth
so
it
is
the
eighteenth
now
are
you
ill
charlot
charlot
pulled
himself
together
no
it
nothing
i
only
tired
you
can
put
out
the
lights
i
shall
be
out
of
the
theatre
in
five
minutes
i
only
want
to
do
one
or
two
little
things
here
all
right
said
jean
turning
away
shut
the
door
behind
you
when
you
leave
if
i
have
gone
to
bed
charlot
sat
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
and
wiped
his
brow
i
do
like
this
business
he
muttered
why
the
deuce
did
he
want
to
go
what
does
this
woman
want
with
him
i
may
be
only
an
old
fool
but
i
know
what
i
know
and
there
have
been
no
end
of
queer
stories
about
this
job
already
he
sat
there
meditating
till
an
idea
took
shape
in
his
mind
can
i
dare
to
go
round
there
and
just
prowl
about
of
course
he
will
be
furious
but
suppose
that
letter
was
a
decoy
and
he
is
walking
into
a
trap
one
never
can
tell
an
assignation
in
that
particular
street
with
that
prison
opposite
and
gurn
to
be
guillotined
within
the
next
hour
or
so
the
man
made
up
his
mind
hurriedly
put
on
his
coat
and
hat
and
switched
off
the
electric
lights
in
the
exquisitely
appointed
i
go
he
said
aloud
if
i
see
anything
suspicious
or
if
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
i
do
see
valgrand
leaving
the
house
well
charlot
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
yes
i
will
go
i
shall
be
much
easier
in
my
mind
xxxi
fell
treachery
number
rue
messier
was
a
wretched
house
that
belonged
to
a
country
who
seldom
came
to
paris
it
was
damp
dirty
and
dilapidated
and
would
have
had
to
be
rebuilt
from
top
to
bottom
if
it
were
to
be
rendered
habitable
there
had
been
a
long
succession
of
tenants
of
this
hovel
shady
disreputable
people
who
for
the
most
part
left
without
paying
any
rent
the
landlord
being
only
too
glad
if
occasionally
they
left
behind
them
a
little
miserable
furniture
or
worn
out
kitchen
utensils
he
was
finding
it
ever
more
difficult
to
let
the
wretched
house
and
for
weeks
together
it
had
remained
unoccupied
but
one
day
about
a
month
ago
he
had
been
astonished
by
receiving
an
application
for
the
tenancy
from
someone
who
vaguely
signed
himself
durand
and
still
further
astonished
by
finding
in
the
envelope
representing
a
year
rent
in
advance
delighted
with
this
windfall
and
congratulating
himself
on
not
having
gone
to
the
expense
of
putting
the
hovel
into
something
like
repair
unnecessary
now
since
he
had
secured
a
tenant
and
a
good
one
for
at
least
twelve
months
the
landlord
promptly
sent
a
receipt
to
this
durand
with
the
keys
and
thought
no
more
about
the
matter
in
the
principal
room
on
the
first
floor
of
this
hovel
a
little
poor
furniture
had
been
put
a
shabby
sofa
an
equally
shabby
a
few
chairs
and
a
deal
table
on
the
table
was
a
a
small
kettle
over
a
and
a
few
cups
and
small
cakes
a
smoky
lamp
shed
a
dim
light
over
this
depressing
interior
and
a
handful
of
coal
was
smouldering
in
the
cracked
grate
and
here
in
these
miserable
surroundings
lady
beltham
was
installed
on
this
eighteenth
of
december
the
great
lady
was
even
paler
than
usual
and
her
eyes
shone
with
a
curious
brilliance
that
she
was
suffering
from
the
most
acute
and
feverish
nervous
excitement
was
patent
from
the
way
in
which
she
kept
putting
her
hands
to
her
heart
as
though
the
violence
of
its
throbbing
were
unendurable
and
from
the
restless
way
in
which
she
paced
the
room
stopping
at
every
other
step
to
listen
for
some
sound
to
reach
her
through
the
silence
of
the
night
once
she
stepped
quickly
from
the
middle
of
the
room
to
the
wall
opposite
the
door
that
opened
on
to
the
staircase
she
pushed
ajar
the
door
of
a
small
cupboard
and
murmured
hush
making
a
warning
movement
with
her
hands
as
if
addressing
someone
concealed
there
then
she
moved
forward
again
and
sinking
on
to
the
sofa
pressed
her
hands
against
her
throbbing
temples
no
one
yet
she
murmured
presently
oh
i
would
give
ten
years
of
my
life
to
is
all
really
lost
her
eyes
wandered
round
the
room
what
a
forbidding
squalid
place
and
again
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
paced
the
room
through
the
grimy
panes
of
the
window
she
could
just
see
a
long
row
of
roofs
and
chimneys
outlined
against
the
sky
oh
those
black
roofs
those
horrible
black
roofs
she
muttered
the
already
wretched
light
in
the
wretched
room
was
burning
dimmer
and
lady
beltham
turned
up
the
wick
of
the
lamp
as
she
did
so
she
caught
a
sound
and
stopped
can
that
be
he
she
exclaimed
and
hurried
to
the
door
footsteps
and
a
man
footsteps
the
next
moment
she
was
sure
someone
stumbled
in
the
passage
below
came
slowly
up
the
stairs
was
on
the
landing
lady
beltham
recoiled
to
the
sofa
and
sank
down
on
it
turning
her
back
to
the
door
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
valgrand
valgrand
was
a
man
with
a
passion
for
adventure
but
invariable
success
in
his
flirtations
had
made
him
blasé
and
now
it
was
only
the
absolutely
novel
that
could
appeal
to
him
and
there
could
certainly
be
no
question
about
the
woman
who
had
sent
him
the
present
invitation
being
anything
but
a
commonplace
one
moreover
it
was
not
just
any
woman
who
had
asked
him
to
keep
this
assignation
in
the
outward
guise
of
gurn
but
the
one
woman
in
whose
heart
the
murderer
ought
to
inspire
the
greatest
abhorrence
the
widow
of
the
man
whom
gurn
had
murdered
what
should
his
deportment
be
when
he
came
face
to
face
with
her
that
was
what
preoccupied
the
actor
as
he
left
the
theatre
and
made
him
dismiss
the
taxi
in
which
he
had
started
before
he
reached
his
destination
valgrand
came
into
the
room
slowly
and
with
a
trained
eye
for
effect
he
flung
his
cloak
and
hat
theatrically
on
the
and
moved
towards
lady
beltham
who
still
sat
motionless
with
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
i
have
come
he
said
in
deep
tones
lady
beltham
uttered
a
little
exclamation
as
if
of
surprise
and
seemed
even
more
anxious
to
hide
from
him
odd
thought
valgrand
she
seems
to
be
really
upset
what
can
i
say
to
her
i
wonder
but
lady
beltham
made
a
great
effort
and
sat
up
looking
at
the
actor
with
strained
eyes
yet
striving
to
force
a
smile
thank
you
for
coming
sir
she
murmured
it
is
not
from
you
madame
that
the
thanks
should
come
valgrand
answered
magnificently
quite
the
reverse
i
am
infinitely
grateful
to
you
for
having
summoned
me
pray
believe
that
i
would
have
been
here
even
sooner
but
for
the
delay
inevitable
on
a
first
performance
but
you
are
cold
he
broke
off
for
lady
beltham
was
shivering
yes
i
am
she
said
almost
inaudibly
mechanically
pulling
a
scarf
over
her
shoulders
valgrand
was
standing
taking
in
every
detail
of
the
squalid
room
in
which
he
found
himself
with
this
woman
whose
wealth
and
taste
and
sumptuous
home
at
neuilly
were
notorious
i
must
clear
up
this
mystery
he
thought
while
he
moved
to
the
window
to
see
that
it
was
shut
and
searched
about
in
vain
for
a
little
coal
to
put
upon
the
fire
while
he
was
thus
occupied
lady
beltham
also
rose
and
going
to
the
table
poured
out
two
cups
of
tea
perhaps
this
will
warm
us
in
the
absence
of
anything
better
she
said
making
an
effort
to
seem
more
amiable
i
am
afraid
it
is
rather
strong
valgrand
i
hope
you
do
not
mind
and
with
a
hand
that
trembled
as
if
it
held
a
heavy
weight
she
brought
one
of
the
cups
to
her
guest
tea
never
upsets
me
madame
valgrand
replied
as
he
took
the
cup
indeed
i
like
it
he
came
to
the
table
and
picked
up
the
basin
filled
with
castor
sugar
making
first
as
if
to
put
some
in
her
cup
thanks
i
never
take
sugar
in
tea
she
said
valgrand
made
a
little
grimace
i
admire
you
but
i
will
not
imitate
you
he
said
and
unceremoniously
tipped
a
generous
helping
of
the
sugar
into
his
own
cup
lady
beltham
watched
him
with
haggard
eyes
while
they
were
sipping
their
tea
there
was
silence
between
them
lady
beltham
went
back
to
the
sofa
and
valgrand
took
a
chair
quite
close
to
her
the
conversation
was
certainly
lacking
in
animation
he
reflected
whimsically
would
the
lady
succeed
in
reducing
him
to
the
level
of
intelligence
of
a
callow
schoolboy
and
she
most
certainly
did
seem
to
be
horribly
upset
he
raised
his
eyes
to
her
and
found
that
she
was
gazing
into
infinity
one
has
got
to
draw
upon
psychology
here
valgrand
mused
it
is
not
me
myself
in
whom
this
lovely
creature
takes
any
interest
or
she
would
not
have
desired
me
to
come
in
these
trappings
that
make
me
look
like
gurn
it
his
skin
that
i
must
stop
in
but
what
is
the
proper
attitude
to
adopt
the
sentimental
or
the
brutal
or
shall
i
appeal
to
her
proselytising
mania
and
do
the
repentant
sinner
act
i
chance
it
here
goes
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
as
he
moved
lady
beltham
looked
round
uneasy
frightened
almost
anguished
it
seemed
as
though
she
realised
that
the
moment
had
come
for
extraordinary
things
to
happen
valgrand
began
to
speak
as
he
did
upon
the
stage
restraining
his
effects
at
first
and
controlling
his
voice
of
set
purpose
to
give
full
effect
to
it
later
on
modulating
it
cleverly
at
your
summons
madame
the
prisoner
gurn
has
burst
his
bonds
broken
through
the
door
of
his
cell
and
scaled
his
prison
walls
triumphing
over
every
obstacle
with
the
single
object
of
coming
to
your
feet
he
comes
and
he
took
a
step
nearer
to
her
lady
beltham
stayed
him
with
a
gesture
of
terror
do
do
please
say
no
more
she
murmured
i
got
a
bite
valgrand
said
to
himself
let
try
another
bait
and
as
if
repeating
a
part
he
said
dramatically
has
your
charitable
heart
turned
towards
the
guilty
soul
that
you
fain
would
rescue
from
transgression
men
say
you
are
so
great
a
lady
so
good
so
near
to
heaven
again
lady
beltham
put
up
a
protesting
hand
not
that
not
that
she
said
imploringly
oh
this
is
torture
go
away
in
her
distress
she
was
really
superbly
beautiful
but
valgrand
knew
too
much
about
women
of
every
temperament
neurotic
hysterical
and
many
another
kind
not
to
suppose
that
here
he
was
merely
taking
part
in
a
sentimental
comedy
he
made
a
rough
gesture
and
laid
his
hand
on
lady
beltham
arm
do
you
not
know
me
he
said
harshly
i
am
gurn
i
will
crush
you
to
my
heart
and
he
tried
to
draw
her
close
to
him
but
this
time
lady
beltham
threw
him
off
with
the
violence
of
despair
stand
back
you
brute
she
cried
in
tones
that
there
was
no
mistaking
valgrand
recoiled
in
real
dismay
and
stood
silent
in
the
middle
of
the
room
while
lady
beltham
went
to
the
wall
farthest
from
him
and
leaned
for
support
against
it
listen
madame
valgrand
began
presently
in
dulcet
tones
that
had
the
effect
of
making
lady
beltham
try
to
control
her
emotion
and
murmur
some
faint
words
of
apology
of
course
you
know
i
am
valgrand
valgrand
the
actor
i
will
apologise
for
having
come
to
you
like
this
but
i
have
some
small
excuse
in
your
note
my
note
she
murmured
oh
yes
i
forgot
valgrand
went
on
seeming
to
pick
his
words
you
have
overestimated
your
strength
and
now
perhaps
you
find
the
resemblance
too
startling
do
not
be
frightened
but
your
letter
came
to
me
like
healing
balm
upon
a
quivering
wound
for
weeks
long
weeks
the
actor
stopped
and
mechanically
rubbed
his
eyes
odd
he
thought
to
himself
but
i
feel
ever
so
much
more
inclined
to
go
to
sleep
than
to
make
love
he
shook
off
his
real
desire
for
sleep
and
began
again
i
have
loved
you
since
the
day
i
saw
you
first
i
love
you
with
an
intensity
for
some
moments
lady
beltham
had
been
looking
at
him
with
a
calmer
air
and
eyes
that
were
less
hostile
the
old
amorist
observed
it
and
made
a
tremendous
effort
to
overcome
his
most
inopportune
drowsiness
how
shall
i
be
silent
when
at
last
kind
heaven
is
about
to
grant
the
fondest
desire
of
my
heart
when
all
afire
with
love
i
am
kneeling
at
your
feet
valgrand
dropped
to
his
knees
lady
beltham
drew
herself
up
listening
in
the
distance
a
clock
struck
four
oh
i
can
bear
it
no
longer
she
cried
stammeringly
i
can
bear
no
more
listen
four
no
no
it
is
too
much
too
much
for
me
the
woman
seemed
absolutely
frantic
she
paced
up
and
down
the
room
like
a
caged
animal
then
she
came
close
to
valgrand
and
looked
at
him
with
an
immense
pity
in
her
eyes
go
sir
if
you
believe
in
god
go
away
go
as
quickly
as
you
can
valgrand
struggled
to
his
feet
his
head
was
heavy
and
he
had
an
irresistible
desire
to
hold
his
tongue
and
just
stay
where
he
was
partly
from
gallantry
and
partly
from
his
desire
not
to
move
he
murmured
not
without
a
certain
aptness
i
believe
only
in
the
god
of
love
madame
and
he
bids
me
remain
in
vain
did
lady
beltham
make
every
effort
to
rouse
the
actor
and
induce
him
to
go
away
in
vain
were
all
her
frantic
appeals
to
him
to
fly
i
will
stay
was
all
he
said
and
he
dropped
heavily
on
the
sofa
by
lady
beltham
side
and
mechanically
tried
to
put
his
arm
round
her
listen
she
began
freeing
herself
from
him
in
heavens
name
you
must
and
yet
i
can
not
tell
you
oh
it
is
horrible
i
am
going
mad
how
am
i
to
choose
what
am
i
to
do
which
oh
go
go
go
there
is
not
a
minute
to
lose
i
will
stay
said
valgrand
again
this
amazing
drowsiness
was
gaining
on
him
so
fast
that
he
had
but
one
desire
left
for
sleep
surely
a
strange
assignation
this
and
a
poor
kind
of
lover
too
lady
beltham
stopped
her
torrent
of
appeal
and
looked
at
the
actor
crumpled
up
beside
her
suddenly
she
started
and
listened
a
slight
noise
became
audible
coming
from
the
staircase
lady
beltham
stood
erect
and
rigid
then
dropped
to
her
knees
upon
the
floor
oh
it
is
all
over
she
sobbed
in
spite
of
his
overwhelming
longing
for
sleep
valgrand
suddenly
started
two
heavy
hands
fell
on
his
shoulder
and
then
his
arms
were
pulled
behind
him
and
his
wrists
rapidly
bound
together
good
god
he
cried
in
stupefied
surprise
turning
quickly
round
two
men
stood
before
him
old
soldiers
by
the
look
of
them
in
dark
uniforms
relieved
only
by
the
gleam
of
metal
buttons
he
was
going
to
say
more
but
one
of
the
men
laid
his
hand
over
his
lips
hush
he
said
peremptorily
valgrand
made
frantic
efforts
to
prevent
himself
from
falling
what
does
this
mean
let
me
go
what
right
the
two
men
began
to
drag
him
gently
away
come
along
said
one
of
them
in
his
ear
time
up
do
be
obstinate
besides
you
know
it
quite
useless
to
resist
gurn
the
other
added
not
unkindly
nothing
in
the
world
could
i
do
understand
valgrand
protested
feebly
who
are
you
and
why
do
you
call
me
gurn
let
me
finish
growled
one
of
the
men
irritably
you
know
we
are
running
an
awful
risk
in
getting
you
out
of
the
prison
and
bringing
you
here
when
you
are
supposed
to
be
with
the
chaplain
you
swore
you
would
behave
squarely
with
us
and
go
back
when
you
were
told
now
you
got
to
keep
your
promise
the
lady
paid
us
well
to
give
you
an
hour
with
her
the
other
man
put
in
but
you
had
more
than
an
hour
and
a
half
and
we
got
our
characters
and
our
situations
to
look
after
so
now
come
along
gurn
and
do
let
us
have
any
nonsense
valgrand
fighting
hard
against
his
overpowering
sleepiness
began
to
have
some
vague
comprehension
of
what
was
happening
he
recognised
the
uniforms
and
guessed
that
the
men
were
prison
warders
good
god
he
exclaimed
thickly
the
fools
think
i
am
gurn
but
i
am
not
gurn
ask
he
cast
a
despairing
eye
at
lady
beltham
who
throughout
the
awful
scene
remained
on
her
knees
in
a
corner
of
the
room
dumb
with
anguish
apparently
deaf
and
turned
to
stone
tell
them
madame
he
implored
her
oh
god
save
me
but
still
the
warders
dragged
him
towards
the
door
by
an
herculean
effort
he
swayed
them
back
with
him
into
the
middle
of
the
room
i
am
not
gurn
i
tell
you
he
shouted
i
am
valgrand
valgrand
the
actor
everybody
in
the
world
knows
me
you
know
it
too
but
search
me
i
tell
you
and
he
made
a
sign
with
his
head
towards
his
left
side
look
in
my
my
name
inside
and
you
find
a
letter
too
proof
of
the
trap
i
been
led
into
the
letter
from
that
woman
over
there
better
look
and
see
nibet
one
warder
said
to
the
other
and
to
valgrand
he
added
not
so
much
noise
man
do
you
mean
to
get
us
all
caught
nibet
passed
a
quick
hand
through
valgrand
pockets
there
was
no
there
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
besides
what
about
it
he
growled
we
brought
gurn
here
did
we
well
we
got
to
take
gurn
back
again
that
all
i
know
come
on
beaten
down
by
the
drowsiness
that
was
quite
irresistible
and
worn
out
by
his
violent
but
futile
efforts
to
resist
the
warders
valgrand
was
half
dragged
half
carried
out
by
the
two
men
his
head
drooping
on
his
chest
his
consciousness
failing
but
still
as
they
were
getting
him
down
the
stairs
his
voice
could
be
heard
in
the
room
above
bleating
more
weakly
and
at
longer
intervals
i
am
not
gurn
i
am
not
gurn
once
more
silence
reigned
in
the
room
after
the
three
men
had
gone
lady
beltham
rose
to
her
feet
tottered
to
the
window
and
stood
there
listening
she
heard
their
footsteps
crossing
the
street
and
stopping
by
the
door
into
the
prison
she
waited
for
a
few
minutes
to
make
sure
that
they
had
escaped
unnoticed
from
their
amazing
adventure
then
turned
again
to
the
sofa
struggled
to
unfasten
the
collar
of
her
dress
to
get
more
air
drew
a
few
deep
sighs
and
swooned
the
door
opposite
the
staircase
opened
slowly
and
noiselessly
gurn
emerged
from
the
darkness
and
went
towards
lady
beltham
the
murderer
flung
himself
at
her
feet
covered
her
face
with
kisses
and
pressed
her
hands
in
his
maud
he
called
maud
she
did
not
answer
and
he
hunted
about
the
room
for
something
to
revive
her
presently
however
she
recovered
consciousness
unaided
and
uttered
a
faint
sigh
her
lover
hurried
to
her
oh
gurn
she
murmured
laying
her
white
hand
on
the
wretch
neck
it
you
dear
come
close
to
me
and
hold
me
in
your
arms
it
was
too
much
for
me
i
almost
broke
down
and
told
everything
i
could
have
borne
no
more
oh
what
an
appalling
time
she
sat
up
sharply
her
face
drawn
with
terror
listen
i
can
hear
him
still
try
not
to
think
about
it
gurn
whispered
caressing
her
did
you
hear
him
how
he
kept
on
saying
am
not
gurn
i
am
not
gurn
oh
heaven
grant
they
may
not
find
that
out
gurn
himself
was
shaken
by
the
horror
of
the
plot
he
had
contrived
with
his
mistress
to
effect
this
substitution
of
another
for
himself
it
surpassed
in
ghastliness
anything
that
had
gone
before
and
he
had
not
dared
to
give
the
least
hint
of
it
to
nibet
the
warders
were
well
paid
he
said
to
reassure
her
now
they
would
deny
everything
he
hesitated
a
second
and
then
asked
he
drank
the
drug
did
he
lady
beltham
nodded
assent
it
will
take
effect
it
was
acting
already
so
rapidly
that
i
thought
for
a
moment
he
would
fall
unconscious
there
at
my
feet
gurn
drew
a
deep
breath
maud
we
are
saved
he
exclaimed
see
he
went
on
as
soon
as
it
is
light
and
there
are
enough
people
in
the
street
for
us
to
mix
with
them
unobserved
we
will
go
away
from
here
while
you
were
with
him
i
burned
my
other
clothes
so
i
will
take
these
to
get
away
in
he
picked
up
the
hat
and
cloak
which
valgrand
had
thrown
upon
the
chair
and
wrapped
the
heavy
cloak
around
himself
this
will
conceal
me
effectively
let
us
go
at
once
lady
beltham
exclaimed
but
gurn
stayed
her
i
must
get
rid
of
this
beard
and
my
moustache
he
said
and
he
took
a
pair
of
scissors
from
his
pocket
and
was
walking
towards
a
when
suddenly
they
both
heard
the
distinct
sound
of
footsteps
coming
slowly
and
steadily
up
the
stairs
gurn
had
no
time
to
get
back
to
his
former
all
he
could
do
was
to
sink
into
the
one
that
was
in
the
room
and
conceal
his
features
as
well
as
he
could
by
turning
down
the
brim
of
the
hat
and
turning
up
the
collar
of
the
cloak
which
the
actor
had
forgotten
the
man
went
as
white
as
a
sheet
but
lady
beltham
appeared
to
recover
all
her
presence
of
mind
and
strength
and
daring
at
the
approach
of
danger
and
she
hurried
to
the
door
but
though
she
tried
to
keep
it
shut
it
slowly
turned
upon
the
hinges
and
a
timid
hesitating
figure
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
advanced
towards
the
retreating
woman
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
lady
beltham
faltered
i
beg
you
to
excuse
me
madame
the
man
began
i
came
to
he
caught
sight
of
gurn
and
pointed
to
him
valgrand
knows
me
well
i
am
charlot
his
dresser
at
the
theatre
and
i
came
to
i
wanted
to
have
a
word
stay
he
took
a
small
square
parcel
from
his
pocket
valgrand
went
off
so
hurriedly
that
he
forgot
his
and
so
i
came
to
bring
it
to
him
the
dresser
was
trying
to
get
near
the
murderer
whom
he
supposed
to
be
his
master
but
lady
beltham
in
the
most
acute
anxiety
kept
between
the
two
men
charlot
misunderstood
her
intention
i
also
came
to
he
stopped
again
and
whispered
to
lady
beltham
he
does
not
speak
is
he
very
angry
with
me
for
coming
i
did
come
out
of
curiosity
or
to
cause
you
any
trouble
madame
will
you
ask
him
not
to
be
very
angry
with
his
poor
old
charlot
lady
beltham
felt
like
swooning
again
she
could
endure
very
little
of
this
old
man
garrulity
go
for
goodness
sake
go
she
said
peremptorily
i
am
going
charlot
said
i
know
i
am
in
the
way
but
i
must
explain
to
him
and
he
raised
his
voice
and
spoke
to
gurn
who
sat
quite
still
sinking
as
far
as
he
could
into
the
shadow
of
the
chair
you
are
not
very
angry
with
me
valgrand
are
you
and
getting
no
reply
he
looked
apologetically
at
lady
beltham
it
was
all
these
stories
and
then
the
street
and
the
prison
opposite
but
perhaps
you
do
not
know
you
see
i
read
in
the
paper
yesterday
or
rather
a
couple
of
hours
ago
that
that
man
gurn
who
murdered
the
rich
english
gentleman
was
to
be
executed
this
morning
and
so
i
was
rather
what
you
might
call
uneasy
at
first
i
only
meant
to
follow
valgrand
and
wait
for
him
down
below
but
i
lost
my
way
and
i
have
only
just
arrived
i
found
the
door
open
and
as
i
did
not
know
whether
he
had
gone
or
was
still
here
i
took
the
liberty
to
come
upstairs
but
i
am
going
now
quite
easy
in
my
mind
since
he
is
quiet
and
happy
here
with
you
and
i
beg
your
pardon
madame
he
threw
a
last
appeal
to
where
gurn
sat
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
m
valgrand
he
sighed
as
no
answer
was
forthcoming
and
made
a
pathetic
little
appeal
to
lady
beltham
you
will
explain
to
him
madame
wo
you
he
is
a
kind
master
and
he
will
understand
one
does
get
fancies
like
that
you
know
but
now
i
will
go
away
easy
quite
easy
in
my
mind
since
i
have
seen
him
charlot
turned
away
slowly
with
bent
shoulders
as
he
passed
the
window
he
glanced
outside
and
stopped
short
day
was
just
beginning
to
break
making
the
wan
light
of
the
street
lamps
still
more
wan
from
the
window
a
view
could
be
obtained
of
a
kind
of
platform
at
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
arago
which
was
bounded
by
the
high
wall
of
the
santé
prison
this
spot
usually
deserted
was
crowded
with
people
a
moving
mob
swarming
and
struggling
behind
some
hastily
erected
barriers
charlot
stretched
a
trembling
hand
towards
the
spectacle
in
sudden
comprehension
good
heavens
he
cried
that
must
be
where
they
are
putting
up
the
scaffold
yes
i
can
see
the
planks
and
uprights
it
is
the
guillotine
the
exe
the
old
man
words
ended
in
a
sudden
cry
and
almost
simultaneously
there
was
a
heavy
thud
struck
from
behind
charlot
fell
like
a
log
to
the
floor
while
lady
beltham
recoiled
in
terror
clenching
her
fists
to
prevent
herself
from
screaming
seizing
the
opportunity
presented
by
valgrand
faithful
servant
standing
so
still
hypnotised
by
the
gruesome
spectacle
being
prepared
outside
gurn
had
drawn
a
knife
from
his
pocket
and
springing
on
the
unfortunate
old
man
had
driven
the
blade
up
to
the
hilt
behind
his
neck
charlot
fell
prone
and
rigid
the
weapon
remaining
in
the
wound
and
stopping
the
flow
of
blood
lady
beltham
was
staring
at
the
victim
in
horror
but
gurn
seized
her
roughly
by
the
arm
without
troubling
to
alter
the
appearance
of
his
face
but
horrified
as
she
was
by
the
tragedies
which
had
succeeded
one
another
in
such
appalling
and
rapid
succession
during
this
awful
night
gurn
drew
the
woman
to
him
and
hurried
her
away
come
quick
he
muttered
hoarsely
let
us
get
out
of
this
xxxii
on
the
scaffold
it
was
still
dark
in
the
keen
morning
air
a
crowd
came
hurrying
along
the
pavements
flowing
over
into
the
roadways
the
boulevards
were
black
with
people
all
marching
briskly
towards
one
common
goal
and
it
was
a
singing
crowd
chanting
the
choruses
of
popular
songs
and
swarming
into
the
open
restaurants
and
and
drinking
dens
and
it
was
noticeable
that
all
these
late
birds
belonged
to
one
of
two
sharply
divided
classes
they
were
either
rich
or
miserably
poor
they
either
came
from
the
night
clubs
or
they
were
the
poor
devils
with
no
homes
or
hearths
who
roam
about
the
city
from
one
year
end
to
another
there
were
crooks
whose
faces
shone
with
the
evil
excitement
of
alcohol
of
all
kinds
beggars
and
young
men
all
young
men
with
sleek
oiled
hair
and
shiny
boots
in
whose
eyes
and
demeanour
theft
and
crime
could
be
seen
by
a
curious
coincidence
the
great
news
seemed
to
have
reached
all
toffs
and
crooks
alike
at
exactly
the
same
time
about
midnight
the
rumour
had
run
round
the
town
it
was
certain
definite
this
time
the
official
steps
had
been
taken
and
the
guillotine
was
going
to
raise
her
arms
towards
the
sky
at
earliest
dawn
gurn
the
man
who
had
murdered
lord
beltham
was
to
undergo
the
supreme
punishment
and
expiate
his
murder
with
his
life
no
sooner
had
the
great
news
become
known
than
all
prepared
as
for
a
holiday
to
go
to
see
the
man
head
fall
at
montmartre
carriages
were
requisitioned
and
were
at
a
premium
women
in
gorgeous
toilets
and
sparkling
with
jewels
streamed
from
the
open
doors
into
the
carriages
which
should
bear
them
swiftly
towards
the
santé
prison
and
the
place
of
execution
in
the
faubourgs
likewise
the
bars
were
emptied
of
their
customers
and
men
and
women
linked
set
forth
on
foot
with
songs
and
ribaldries
upon
their
lips
for
the
spectacle
of
blood
and
the
boulevard
arago
around
the
santé
prison
an
atmosphere
of
pleasure
reigned
as
the
people
massed
together
in
tight
ranks
produced
bottles
of
wine
and
ate
sausages
and
gaily
enjoyed
an
improvised
supper
in
the
open
air
while
speculating
about
the
details
of
the
sight
they
had
come
to
see
and
so
the
crowd
amused
itself
for
gurn
head
was
going
to
fall
worming
his
way
through
the
crowd
françois
bonbonne
the
landlord
of
the
pig
led
a
little
company
of
friends
who
took
advantage
of
his
great
stature
to
find
the
best
path
to
take
the
landlord
was
already
in
honour
of
the
occasion
come
along
billy
tom
he
shouted
catch
hold
of
the
tail
of
my
coat
and
then
you
wo
lose
us
where
is
hogshead
geoffroy
he
coming
along
with
bouzille
good
just
fancy
if
bouzille
had
tried
to
get
through
here
with
his
train
there
are
some
people
about
eh
two
men
passed
the
landlord
of
the
market
inn
just
then
come
along
said
one
of
them
and
as
the
other
caught
him
up
juve
added
did
you
recognise
those
fellows
no
said
fandor
juve
told
him
the
names
of
the
men
whom
they
had
passed
you
will
understand
that
i
do
want
them
to
recognise
me
he
said
and
as
fandor
smiled
juve
went
on
it
a
queer
thing
but
it
is
always
the
future
customers
of
the
guillotine
apaches
and
fellows
like
that
who
make
a
point
of
seeing
this
ghastly
spectacle
the
detective
stopped
and
laid
a
hand
upon
the
journalist
shoulder
wait
he
said
we
are
right
in
front
now
only
the
men
who
are
holding
the
line
are
ahead
of
us
if
we
want
to
get
through
and
avoid
the
crush
we
must
make
ourselves
known
at
once
here
is
your
pass
jérôme
fandor
took
the
card
which
juve
held
out
to
him
and
had
got
for
him
as
a
special
favour
what
do
we
do
now
he
asked
here
come
the
municipal
guards
juve
replied
i
can
see
their
sabres
flashing
we
will
get
behind
the
newspaper
kiosks
and
let
them
drive
the
crowd
back
and
then
we
will
go
through
juve
had
correctly
anticipated
the
manoeuvre
which
the
officer
in
command
of
the
squadron
immediately
proceeded
to
execute
grave
and
imposing
and
marvellously
mounted
on
magnificent
horses
a
large
number
of
municipal
guards
had
just
arrived
on
the
boulevard
arago
by
the
side
of
the
santé
prison
and
just
where
the
detective
and
the
journalist
were
standing
a
sharp
order
rang
out
and
the
guards
deployed
and
riding
knee
to
knee
drove
the
crowd
back
irresistibly
to
the
end
of
the
avenue
utterly
disregarding
the
angry
murmur
of
protest
and
the
general
crushing
that
ensued
the
municipal
guards
were
followed
by
troops
of
infantry
and
these
again
by
gendarmes
who
holding
hands
moved
on
all
who
by
some
means
or
other
had
managed
to
worm
their
way
between
the
horses
of
the
guards
and
the
infantry
determined
at
any
cost
to
keep
in
the
front
row
of
spectators
juve
and
fandor
armed
with
their
special
passes
which
admitted
them
to
the
enclosure
where
the
guillotine
actually
stood
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
through
the
triple
line
they
found
themselves
in
the
centre
of
a
large
portion
of
the
boulevard
arago
entirely
clear
of
spectators
and
bounded
on
one
side
by
the
walls
of
the
prison
and
on
the
other
by
those
of
a
convent
in
this
clear
space
about
a
dozen
individuals
in
black
coats
and
silk
hats
were
walking
about
affecting
a
complete
indifference
to
what
was
going
to
happen
although
really
they
were
profoundly
affected
by
it
chief
juve
said
pointing
them
out
my
colleagues
some
of
yours
too
do
you
see
them
chief
reporters
of
the
big
dailies
are
you
aware
that
you
are
uncommonly
lucky
to
have
been
selected
at
your
extremely
youthful
age
to
represent
your
paper
at
this
lugubrious
function
jérôme
fandor
made
an
odd
grimace
i
do
mind
admitting
to
you
juve
that
i
am
here
because
i
am
like
you
in
wanting
to
see
gurn
head
fall
you
have
satisfied
me
beyond
all
doubt
that
gurn
is
fantômas
and
i
want
to
be
sure
that
fantômas
is
really
dead
but
if
it
were
not
the
execution
of
that
one
particular
wretch
the
only
thing
that
can
make
society
safe
i
should
certainly
have
declined
the
honour
of
reporting
this
event
it
upsets
you
yes
juve
bent
his
head
so
it
does
me
just
think
for
more
than
five
years
i
have
been
fighting
fantômas
for
more
than
five
years
i
have
believed
in
his
existence
in
spite
of
all
ridicule
and
sarcasm
for
more
than
five
years
i
have
been
working
for
this
wretch
death
for
death
is
the
only
thing
that
can
put
a
stop
to
his
crimes
juve
paused
a
moment
but
fandor
made
no
comment
and
i
am
rather
sick
and
sorry
too
because
although
i
have
reached
this
certainty
that
gurn
is
fantômas
and
have
succeeded
in
convincing
intelligent
people
who
were
ready
to
study
my
work
in
good
faith
i
have
nevertheless
not
succeeded
in
establishing
legal
proof
that
gurn
is
fantômas
deibler
and
the
public
prosecutor
and
people
generally
think
that
it
is
merely
gurn
who
is
going
to
be
decapitated
now
i
may
have
secured
this
man
condemnation
but
none
the
less
he
has
beaten
me
and
deprived
me
of
the
satisfaction
of
having
brought
him
fantômas
to
the
scaffold
i
have
only
consigned
gurn
to
the
scaffold
and
that
is
a
defeat
the
detective
stopped
from
the
boulevard
arago
from
the
end
to
which
the
crowd
had
been
driven
back
cheers
and
applause
and
joyous
shouts
broke
out
it
was
the
mob
welcoming
the
arrival
of
the
guillotine
drawn
by
an
old
white
horse
a
heavy
black
van
arrived
at
a
fast
trot
escorted
by
four
mounted
police
with
drawn
swords
the
van
stopped
a
few
yards
from
juve
and
fandor
the
police
rode
off
and
a
shabby
brougham
came
into
view
from
which
three
men
in
black
proceeded
to
get
out
monsieur
de
paris
and
his
assistants
juve
informed
fandor
deibler
and
his
men
fandor
shivered
and
juve
went
on
with
his
explanations
that
van
contains
the
timbers
and
the
knife
deibler
and
his
men
will
get
the
guillotine
up
in
half
an
hour
and
in
an
hour
at
the
outside
fantômas
will
be
no
more
while
the
detective
was
speaking
the
executioner
had
stepped
briskly
to
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
proceedings
and
exchanged
a
few
words
with
him
he
signified
his
approval
of
the
arrangements
made
saluted
the
superintendent
of
police
of
that
division
and
turned
to
his
men
come
along
lads
get
to
work
he
caught
sight
of
juve
and
shook
hands
with
him
good
morning
he
said
adding
as
though
his
work
were
of
the
most
commonplace
kind
excuse
me
we
are
a
bit
late
this
morning
the
assistants
took
from
the
van
some
long
cases
wrapped
in
grey
canvas
and
apparently
very
heavy
they
laid
these
on
the
ground
with
the
utmost
care
they
were
the
timbers
and
frame
of
the
guillotine
and
must
not
be
warped
or
strained
for
the
guillotine
is
a
nicely
accurate
machine
they
swept
the
ground
thoroughly
careful
to
remove
any
gravel
which
might
have
affected
the
equilibrium
of
the
framework
and
then
set
up
the
red
uprights
of
the
scaffold
the
floor
timbers
fitted
one
into
another
and
were
joined
by
stout
metal
clamps
fastened
together
by
a
bolt
next
the
men
set
the
grooved
slides
down
which
the
knife
must
fall
into
holes
cut
for
the
purpose
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
guillotine
now
raised
its
awful
arms
to
the
sky
hitherto
deibler
had
merely
watched
his
men
at
work
now
he
took
a
hand
himself
with
a
he
ascertained
that
the
floor
was
absolutely
horizontal
next
he
arranged
the
two
pieces
of
wood
from
each
of
which
a
segment
is
cut
so
as
to
form
the
lunette
into
which
the
victim
neck
is
thrust
then
he
tested
the
lever
to
make
sure
that
it
worked
freely
and
gave
a
curt
order
the
knife
one
of
the
assistants
brought
a
case
which
deibler
opened
and
fandor
instinctively
shrank
as
a
flash
from
the
bright
steel
fell
full
in
his
eyes
that
sinister
triangular
knife
that
presently
would
do
the
work
of
death
deibler
leant
calmly
against
the
guillotine
fitted
the
shank
into
the
grooves
in
the
two
uprights
and
setting
the
mechanism
to
work
hoisted
up
the
knife
which
glittered
strangely
he
looked
the
whole
thing
over
and
turned
again
to
his
assistants
the
hay
a
truss
was
arranged
in
the
lunette
and
deibler
came
up
to
the
instrument
and
pressed
a
spring
like
a
flash
the
knife
dropped
down
the
uprights
and
severed
the
truss
in
two
the
rehearsal
was
finished
now
for
the
real
drama
while
the
guillotine
was
being
set
up
juve
had
stood
by
fandor
nervously
chewing
cigarettes
everything
is
ready
now
he
said
to
the
lad
deibler
has
only
got
to
put
on
his
coat
and
take
delivery
of
fantômas
the
assistants
had
just
arranged
two
baskets
filled
with
bran
along
each
side
of
the
machine
one
was
destined
to
receive
the
severed
head
the
other
the
body
when
that
was
released
from
the
plyer
the
executioner
pulled
on
his
coat
rubbed
his
hands
mechanically
and
then
strode
towards
a
group
of
officials
who
had
arrived
while
the
guillotine
was
being
erected
and
were
now
standing
by
the
entrance
to
the
prison
gentlemen
said
deibler
it
will
be
sunrise
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
can
proceed
to
awaken
the
prisoner
slowly
in
single
file
the
officials
went
inside
the
prison
there
were
present
the
attorney
general
the
public
prosecutor
his
deputy
the
governor
of
the
prison
and
behind
these
havard
deibler
and
his
two
assistants
the
little
company
passed
through
the
corridors
to
the
third
floor
where
the
condemned
cells
are
the
warder
nibet
came
forward
with
his
bunch
of
keys
in
his
hand
deibler
looked
at
the
public
prosecutor
are
you
ready
sir
and
as
that
gentleman
who
was
very
white
made
a
sign
of
assent
deibler
looked
at
the
governor
of
the
prison
unlock
the
cell
the
governor
ordered
nibet
turned
the
key
noiselessly
and
pushed
open
the
door
the
public
prosecutor
stepped
forward
he
had
hoped
to
find
the
condemned
man
asleep
and
so
have
had
a
moment
respite
before
announcing
the
fatal
news
but
he
drew
back
for
the
man
was
awake
and
dressed
sitting
ready
on
his
bed
with
mad
haggard
eyes
gurn
said
the
public
prosecutor
be
brave
your
appeal
has
been
rejected
the
others
standing
behind
him
were
all
silent
and
the
words
of
the
public
prosecutor
fell
like
a
knell
the
condemned
man
however
had
not
stirred
had
not
even
seemed
to
understand
his
attitude
was
that
of
a
man
in
a
state
of
somnambulism
the
public
prosecutor
was
surprised
by
this
strange
impassivity
and
spoke
again
in
strangled
tones
be
brave
be
brave
a
spasm
crossed
the
face
of
the
condemned
man
and
his
lips
moved
as
though
he
were
making
an
effort
to
say
something
i
not
he
murmured
but
deibler
laid
his
hands
upon
the
man
shoulders
and
cut
the
horrid
moment
short
come
now
the
chaplain
came
forward
in
his
turn
pray
my
brother
he
said
do
you
wish
to
hear
mass
at
the
touch
of
the
executioner
the
prisoner
had
trembled
he
rose
like
an
automaton
with
dilated
eyes
and
twitching
face
he
understood
what
the
chaplain
said
and
took
a
step
towards
him
i
not
havard
intervened
and
spoke
to
the
chaplain
really
sir
no
it
is
time
deibler
nodded
approval
let
us
be
quick
we
can
proceed
the
sun
has
risen
the
public
prosecutor
was
still
bleating
be
brave
be
brave
deibler
took
the
man
by
one
arm
a
warder
took
him
by
the
other
and
between
them
they
him
to
the
office
for
his
last
toilette
in
the
little
room
dimly
lighted
by
a
winking
lamp
a
chair
had
been
set
close
to
a
table
the
executioner
and
his
assistant
pushed
the
condemned
man
into
the
chair
and
deibler
took
up
a
pair
of
scissors
the
public
prosecutor
spoke
to
the
prisoner
would
you
like
a
glass
of
rum
would
you
like
a
cigarette
is
there
anything
you
wish
to
have
done
maître
barberoux
who
had
not
arrived
in
time
for
the
awakening
of
the
prisoner
now
approached
his
client
he
too
was
ghastly
white
is
there
anything
else
that
i
can
do
for
you
have
you
any
last
wish
the
condemned
man
made
another
effort
to
rise
from
the
chair
and
a
hoarse
groan
escaped
from
his
throat
i
i
the
prison
doctor
had
joined
the
group
and
now
drew
the
public
prosecutor
deputy
aside
it
is
appalling
he
said
the
man
has
not
articulated
a
single
word
since
he
was
awakened
he
is
as
though
sunk
in
a
stupefied
sleep
there
is
a
technical
word
for
his
condition
he
is
in
a
state
of
inhibition
he
is
alive
and
yet
he
is
a
corpse
anyhow
he
is
utterly
unconscious
incapable
of
any
clear
thought
or
of
saying
a
word
that
has
any
sense
i
have
never
seen
such
complete
stupefaction
deibler
waved
aside
the
men
who
were
pressing
round
him
sign
the
gaol
book
please
havard
he
said
and
while
that
gentleman
affixed
a
shaky
signature
to
the
warrant
authorising
the
delivery
of
gurn
to
the
public
executioner
deibler
took
the
scissors
and
cut
a
segment
out
of
the
prisoner
shirt
and
cut
off
a
wisp
of
hair
that
grew
low
down
on
his
neck
meanwhile
an
assistant
bound
the
wrists
of
the
man
who
was
about
to
die
then
the
executioner
looked
at
his
watch
and
made
a
to
the
public
prosecutor
come
come
it
is
the
time
fixed
by
law
two
assistants
took
the
wretch
by
the
shoulders
and
raised
him
up
there
was
a
horrible
deep
unintelligible
rattle
in
his
throat
i
i
but
no
one
heard
him
and
he
was
dragged
away
it
was
practically
a
corpse
that
the
servants
of
the
guillotine
bore
down
to
the
boulevard
arago
outside
the
first
rosy
tints
of
early
dawn
were
waking
the
birds
and
playing
on
the
great
triangular
knife
drawing
gleams
from
it
the
time
was
ten
minutes
past
five
and
now
the
supreme
moment
was
at
hand
the
crowd
momentarily
growing
denser
was
crushed
behind
the
cordon
of
troops
that
had
difficulty
in
keeping
it
at
a
distance
from
the
guillotine
the
soldiers
unheeding
the
oaths
and
curses
and
entreaties
with
which
they
were
assailed
carried
out
their
orders
and
permitted
no
one
to
take
up
his
stand
anywhere
in
the
near
neighbourhood
of
the
guillotine
except
the
few
rare
individuals
who
had
a
special
pass
a
sudden
murmur
ran
through
the
crowd
the
mounted
police
stationed
opposite
the
guillotine
had
just
drawn
their
sabres
fandor
gripped
juve
hand
nervously
the
detective
was
very
pale
let
us
get
over
there
he
said
and
led
fandor
just
behind
the
guillotine
to
the
side
where
the
severed
head
would
fall
into
the
basket
we
shall
see
the
poor
devil
get
out
of
the
carriage
and
being
fastened
on
to
the
bascule
and
pulled
into
the
lunette
he
went
on
talking
as
if
to
divert
his
own
mind
from
the
thing
before
him
the
best
place
for
seeing
things
i
stood
there
when
peugnez
was
guillotined
a
long
time
ago
now
and
i
was
there
again
in
when
duchémin
the
parricide
was
executed
but
he
came
to
an
abrupt
stop
from
the
great
door
of
the
santé
prison
a
carriage
came
rapidly
out
all
heads
were
uncovered
all
eyes
were
fixed
and
a
deep
silence
fell
upon
the
crowded
boulevard
the
carriage
passed
the
journalist
and
the
detective
at
a
gallop
and
pulled
up
with
a
jerk
just
opposite
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
guillotine
and
at
the
very
foot
of
the
scaffold
deibler
jumped
down
from
the
box
and
opening
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
vehicle
let
down
the
steps
pale
and
nervous
the
chaplain
got
out
backwards
hiding
the
scaffold
from
the
eyes
of
the
condemned
man
whom
the
assistants
managed
somehow
to
help
out
of
the
carriage
fandor
was
shaking
with
nervousness
and
muttering
to
himself
but
things
moved
quickly
now
the
chaplain
still
walking
backwards
hid
the
dread
vision
for
yet
a
few
seconds
more
then
stepped
aside
abruptly
the
assistants
seized
the
condemned
man
and
pushed
him
on
to
the
bascule
juve
was
watching
the
unhappy
wretch
and
could
not
restrain
a
word
of
admiration
that
man
is
a
brave
man
he
has
not
even
turned
pale
generally
condemned
men
are
livid
the
executioner
assistants
had
bound
the
man
upon
the
plank
it
tilted
upwards
deibler
grasped
the
head
by
the
two
ears
and
pulled
it
into
the
lunette
despite
one
last
convulsive
struggle
of
the
victim
there
was
a
click
of
a
spring
the
flash
of
the
falling
knife
a
spurt
of
blood
a
dull
groan
from
ten
thousand
breasts
and
the
head
rolled
into
the
basket
but
juve
had
flung
fandor
aside
and
sprang
towards
the
scaffold
he
thrust
the
assistants
away
and
plunging
his
hands
into
the
bran
that
was
all
soaked
with
blood
he
seized
the
severed
head
by
the
hair
and
stared
at
it
horrified
by
this
scandalous
action
the
assistants
rushed
upon
the
detective
deibler
forced
him
backwards
you
must
be
mad
get
away
fandor
saw
that
juve
was
staggering
and
seemed
about
to
swoon
he
rushed
towards
him
good
god
he
cried
in
tones
of
anguish
it
is
gurn
who
has
just
been
put
to
death
juve
panted
brokenly
this
face
has
not
gone
white
because
it
is
painted
it
is
made
up
like
an
actor
oh
curses
on
him
fantômas
has
escaped
fantômas
has
got
away
he
has
had
some
innocent
man
executed
in
his
stead
