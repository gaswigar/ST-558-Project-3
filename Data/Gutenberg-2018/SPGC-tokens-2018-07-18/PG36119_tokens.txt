the
cinder

chapter
i
the
accident
the
slim
dark
girl
with
big
black
eyes
rushed
to
the
edge
of
the
crumbling
wharf
where
she
dropped
to
her
hands
and
knees
to
peer
eagerly
into
the
green
depths
below
there
was
reason
for
haste
only
a
second
before
the
very
best
suit
of
boys
clothing
in
bancroft
had
tumbled
suddenly
over
the
edge
to
hit
the
water
with
a
most
terrific
splash
now
there
was
a
wide
circle
on
the
surface
with
bubbles
coming
up
it
was
an
excellent
suit
of
clothes
that
went
into
the
lake
serge
fashioned
by
bancroft
best
tailor
to
fit
roger
fairchild
who
was
much
too
plump
for
clothes
but
here
were
those
costly
garments
at
the
very
bottom
of
lake
superior
not
in
the
very
deepest
part
fortunately
but
deep
enough
and
that
was
not
all
their
youthful
owner
was
inside
them
that
morning
when
jeannette
eldest
daughter
of
léon
duval
tumbled
out
of
the
rumpled
bed
that
she
shared
with
her
stepsister
the
day
had
seemed
just
like
any
other
day
it
was
to
prove
as
you
may
have
guessed
quite
different
from
the
ordinary
run
of
days
in
the
first
place
it
was
pleasant
the
first
really
mild
day
after
months
of
cold
weather
in
the
second
place
things
were
to
happen
of
course
things
happened
day
but
then
most
things
like
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
have
a
way
of
happening
over
and
over
again
but
it
is
every
day
that
a
really
truly
adventure
plunges
as
it
were
right
into
own
front
yard
to
be
sure
jeanne
front
yard
invited
adventures
it
was
quite
different
from
any
other
front
yard
in
bancroft
it
was
large
and
wet
and
blue
and
big
enough
to
show
on
any
map
of
the
western
hemisphere
nothing
less
indeed
than
lake
superior
her
side
yard
too
was
another
big
piece
of
the
same
lake
the
rest
of
her
yard
except
what
was
cinder
pond
was
dock
in
order
to
understand
the
adventure
and
indeed
all
the
rest
of
this
story
you
must
have
a
clear
picture
of
jeanne
queer
home
for
it
a
queer
home
for
even
the
daughter
of
a
fisherman
you
see
the
duvals
had
lived
on
dry
land
as
long
as
they
were
able
which
was
not
very
long
to
pay
rent
when
there
were
no
more
landlords
willing
to
wait
forever
for
their
the
impecunious
family
moved
to
an
old
scow
anchored
in
shallow
water
near
an
abandoned
wharf
after
a
time
the
needed
his
property
but
not
the
family
that
was
on
it
the
duvals
were
forced
to
seek
other
shelter
happily
they
found
it
near
at
hand
once
on
a
time
ever
so
far
back
in
the
history
of
bancroft
the
biggest
busiest
and
reddest
of
brick
furnaces
in
that
region
of
iron
and
iron
mines
had
poured
forth
volumes
of
thick
black
smoke
it
was
located
right
at
the
water
edge
on
a
solid
stone
foundation
from
it
a
clean
new
wooden
wharf
extended
southward
for
three
hundred
feet
east
for
nine
hundred
feet
north
for
enough
more
feet
to
touch
the
land
again
this
wharf
formed
three
sides
of
a
huge
oblong
pond
the
shore
made
the
fourth
side
the
shallow
water
inside
this
inclosure
became
known
in
time
as
the
cinder
pond
after
twenty
years
of
activity
the
furnace
with
the
exception
of
the
huge
was
destroyed
by
fire
after
that
there
was
no
further
use
for
the
wharf
originally
built
of
huge
cribs
filled
with
stone
planked
over
with
heavy
timbers
it
became
covered
in
time
first
with
fine
black
cinders
then
with
soil
as
it
grew
less
useful
it
became
more
picturesque
as
things
sometimes
do
by
the
time
the
duvals
helped
themselves
to
the
old
wharf
much
of
its
soft
black
surface
was
broken
out
with
patches
of
green
grass
sturdy
thistles
and
many
other
interesting
weeds
there
were
even
numbers
of
small
but
graceful
trees
fringing
the
inner
edge
of
the
old
wharf
from
which
they
cast
most
beautiful
reflections
into
the
still
waters
of
the
cinder
pond
no
quieter
more
deserted
spot
could
be
imagined
jeannette
father
léon
duval
built
a
house
for
his
family
on
the
southwest
corner
of
the
crumbling
dock
three
hundred
feet
from
land
when
you
have
never
built
a
house
and
when
you
have
no
money
with
which
to
buy
materials
about
the
only
thing
you
can
do
is
to
pick
up
whatever
you
can
find
and
put
it
together
to
the
best
of
your
small
ability
that
is
precisely
what
léon
duval
did
bricks
from
the
old
furnace
boards
from
an
old
barn
part
of
the
cabin
from
a
wrecked
steamboat
nails
from
driftwood
along
the
shore
rusty
stove
pipe
from
the
city
dump
ground
all
went
into
the
house
that
for
many
years
was
to
shelter
the
duvals
when
finished
it
was
of
no
particular
shape
and
no
particular
size
owing
to
the
triangular
nature
of
the
wharf
at
the
point
chosen
the
house
had
to
ramble
a
good
deal
and
mostly
lengthwise
like
a
caterpillar
for
several
reasons
it
had
a
great
many
doors
and
very
few
windows
for
as
long
as
jeanne
could
remember
she
had
lived
in
this
queer
cabin
perched
on
the
outside
that
is
the
side
of
the
deserted
wharf
on
the
day
of
the
mishap
to
roger
fairchild
suit
jeanne
having
put
on
what
was
left
of
her
only
dress
proceeded
to
build
a
fire
in
the
rusty
ramshackle
stove
that
occupied
the
middle
section
of
her
very
queer
home
then
without
stopping
to
figure
out
how
many
it
took
to
make
a
whole
one
she
helped
three
of
these
all
with
tousled
heads
of
reddish
hair
into
various
ragged
garments
perhaps
if
all
the
duvals
had
risen
at
once
the
house
would
have
held
them
at
any
rate
the
older
members
of
the
family
stayed
abed
until
the
smaller
children
had
scampered
either
northward
or
eastward
along
the
wharf
one
to
get
water
one
to
get
wood
and
then
came
the
adventure
roger
did
like
an
adventure
most
anyone
would
have
mistaken
him
for
just
a
plump
boy
in
good
clothes
he
carried
himself
and
a
with
an
air
of
considerable
importance
he
had
risen
early
for
some
especial
reason
and
the
reason
evidently
was
located
near
the
outer
edge
of
the
duval
dock
because
having
reached
a
jutting
timber
a
few
feet
east
of
the
duval
mansion
he
proceeded
to
make
himself
comfortable
he
seated
himself
on
the
outer
end
of
the
jutting
timber
attached
a
wriggling
worm
to
the
hook
that
dangled
from
the
pole
and
then
raising
the
pole
to
an
upright
position
proceeded
to
cast
his
baited
hook
to
a
spot
that
looked
promising
he
repeated
this
casting
operation
a
great
many
times
unfortunately
he
failed
to
notice
that
the
outward
movement
made
by
his
arms
and
body
was
producing
a
curious
effect
on
the
log
on
which
he
sat
each
time
he
made
a
cast
the
squared
timber
jarred
by
his
exertion
moved
forward
just
a
scrap
at
a
time
to
be
sure
but
if
you
have
scraps
they
make
inches
after
a
while
when
the
insecurely
fastened
log
had
crept
out
five
inches
it
took
just
one
more
vigorous
cast
to
finish
the
business
roger
a
very
much
surprised
young
person
went
sprawling
suddenly
into
the
lake
straight
to
the
bottom
of
it
too
while
the
log
after
making
the
mighty
splash
that
caught
jeannette
attention
floated
serenely
on
top
jeannette
whose
everyday
name
was
jeanne
promptly
wrenched
a
great
fish
net
that
was
drying
over
the
low
roof
of
her
home
from
its
place
gathered
it
into
her
arms
and
rushed
to
the
edge
of
the
dock
she
was
just
in
time
the
boy
had
come
to
the
surface
and
was
floundering
about
like
a
huge
turtle
jeanne
threw
a
large
portion
of
the
big
net
overboard
keeping
a
firm
grasp
on
what
remained
hang
on
to
this
she
shouted
do
pull
just
hold
on
there
you
could
sink
if
you
wanted
to
now
just
keep
still
keep
i
tell
you
and
i
tow
you
down
to
that
low
place
where
the
broken
you
can
climb
up
i
guess
do
be
afraid
i
pulled
my
brother
out
four
times
and
my
sister
once
only
it
was
so
deep
there
one
hand
on
that
plank
one
on
the
net
put
your
foot
in
the
crack
that
right
now
give
me
your
hand
there
stand
here
on
my
garden
and
i
wo
have
to
water
it
my
but
you
wet
roger
wet
but
now
that
he
was
no
longer
frightened
he
was
even
angrier
than
wet
to
be
saved
by
a
a
thin
little
slip
of
a
girl
at
that
was
a
fearful
indignity
a
fellow
could
stand
falling
in
but
to
be
saved
by
a
girl
to
make
it
worse
the
dock
was
no
longer
deserted
there
were
folks
gathering
outside
the
shack
to
look
at
him
a
fat
untidy
woman
with
frowzy
reddish
hair
a
bent
old
woman
with
her
head
tied
up
in
a
filthy
rag
a
small
dark
man
with
very
bright
black
eyes
two
staring
children
the
morning
sun
made
three
of
the
tousled
heads
blazed
like
fire
but
the
boy
wrath
blazed
even
more
fiercely
to
be
saved
a
and
all
those
staring
people
watching
him
drip
it
was
too
much
without
a
word
of
thanks
and
with
all
the
dignity
that
he
could
muster
plump
young
roger
marched
past
the
assembled
multitude
it
seemed
like
that
to
him
straight
along
the
dock
toward
the
shore
leaving
behind
him
a
wet
shining
trail
with
much
difficulty
because
of
his
soggy
shoes
he
climbed
the
rough
path
up
the
bank
to
lake
street
crossed
that
thoroughfare
to
clamber
up
the
exceedingly
long
flight
of
stairs
four
long
flights
to
be
exact
that
led
to
the
street
above
a
workman
going
down
met
him
toiling
up
hey
the
man
called
cheerfully
looks
like
you
had
an
accident
fell
in
somewheres
there
was
no
response
roger
climbed
steadily
on
by
sneaking
through
backyards
and
driveways
he
managed
at
last
to
slip
into
the
open
door
of
his
own
home
up
the
stairs
and
into
his
own
pleasant
room
where
he
proceeded
with
some
haste
to
change
his
clothes
he
owned
three
union
suits
he
had
one
of
them
on
one
was
in
the
wash
the
other
have
been
in
his
bureau
drawer
but
it
was
to
ask
for
it
meant
to
disclose
the
fact
that
he
had
been
in
the
lake
a
secret
that
he
had
decided
never
to
disclose
to
with
a
sigh
for
his
own
discomfort
young
roger
dressed
himself
in
dry
garments
his
wet
union
suit
but
what
said
roger
eying
the
heap
of
sodden
clothing
on
the
floor
shall
i
do
with
those
finally
he
hung
the
wet
suit
in
the
closet
with
his
dry
pajamas
spread
carefully
over
them
he
concealed
his
wet
shoes
with
his
socks
stuffed
inside
far
back
in
a
bureau
drawer
chapter
ii
part
of
the
truth
roger
with
his
rather
long
hair
carefully
brushed
sauntered
downstairs
to
the
nicely
furnished
where
his
mother
was
eating
breakfast
fairchild
was
a
most
attractive
little
woman
like
roger
she
was
and
fair
she
was
taller
however
than
roger
and
not
nearly
so
wide
good
morning
said
she
with
a
very
pleasant
smile
i
guess
both
late
this
morning
your
father
been
gone
for
twenty
minutes
good
morning
shivered
roger
dear
me
said
fairchild
catching
sight
of
her
remarkably
sleek
head
i
do
wish
you
would
put
so
much
water
on
your
hair
when
you
comb
it
it
is
at
all
necessary
and
it
looks
particularly
when
it
so
long
do
be
more
careful
next
time
i
will
promised
roger
helping
himself
to
an
orange
it
must
have
taken
you
a
great
while
to
dress
i
thought
i
heard
you
stirring
about
hours
ago
yes
returned
roger
looking
anywhere
except
at
his
pretty
mother
i
glad
you
remembered
to
put
on
your
old
clothes
since
saturday
but
why
what
is
that
that
was
a
thin
brownish
stream
scarcely
more
than
an
elongated
drop
trickling
down
the
boy
wrist
to
the
back
of
his
plump
hand
roger
looked
at
it
with
horror
his
drenched
underwear
was
betraying
him
fairchild
pushed
up
his
coat
sleeve
turned
back
the
damp
cuff
of
his
blue
cotton
shirt
and
disclosed
three
inches
of
wet
sleeve
she
poked
an
investigating
finger
up
her
son
arm
then
her
suspicious
eye
caught
a
curious
change
of
color
in
the
bosom
of
his
blue
shirt
it
had
darkened
mysteriously
in
patches
she
touched
one
of
them
then
she
reached
up
under
his
coat
and
felt
his
moist
back
roger
how
in
the
world
did
your
shirt
get
so
wet
surely
you
did
do
all
that
washing
yourself
no
have
you
been
outdoors
yes
watering
the
grass
no
hum
katie
says
somebody
dug
a
hole
in
my
pansy
bed
last
night
it
a
splendid
place
for
worms
have
you
by
any
chance
been
trying
your
new
pole
silence
you
roger
ye
es
gulped
roger
did
you
fall
in
ye
es
how
did
you
get
out
jus
just
climbed
out
roger
fairchild
you
and
that
window
wide
open
behind
you
come
upstairs
with
me
this
instant
and
i
put
you
to
bed
between
hot
blankets
it
a
mercy
i
discovered
those
wet
clothes
i
have
katie
bring
you
some
hot
broth
the
moment
you
in
bed
roger
under
a
mountain
of
covers
was
thankful
that
he
had
had
to
divulge
the
important
part
jeanne
duval
had
played
in
his
rescue
all
that
morning
when
his
mother
asked
troublesome
questions
he
shivered
so
industriously
that
the
anxious
little
woman
fled
for
more
hot
blankets
or
more
hot
broth
the
blankets
were
tiresome
and
he
already
held
almost
a
whole
boyful
of
broth
but
he
thought
was
better
than
telling
that
he
had
been
pulled
out
of
the
lake
in
a
smelly
old
fish
net
and
by
a
girl
a
girl
at
that
but
in
spite
of
his
care
the
truth
or
at
least
part
of
it
was
to
come
out
the
very
next
day
a
small
barefooted
and
very
ragged
boy
appeared
at
the
fairchilds
back
door
he
carried
a
in
one
hand
a
cap
in
the
other
inside
the
cap
neatly
printed
in
indelible
ink
were
roger
name
and
address
for
roger
like
many
another
careless
boy
frequently
lost
his
belongings
my
sister
said
michael
duval
handing
the
cap
and
the
pole
to
the
cook
sent
these
here
she
pulled
out
of
the
lake
same
as
she
did
the
fat
boy
what
lives
here
how
was
that
now
asked
katie
with
interest
wiv
a
fish
net
it
was
awful
deep
where
he
fell
in
way
over
head
wait
here
sonny
i
tell
the
missus
about
it
but
when
katie
returned
after
telling
missus
she
found
no
small
boy
outside
the
door
michael
had
turned
shy
as
small
boys
will
and
had
fled
neither
katie
nor
fairchild
gazing
down
the
street
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
but
fairchild
managed
to
extract
a
little
more
information
from
roger
now
fully
recovered
from
his
unlucky
bath
yes
the
water
was
deep
ten
miles
deep
he
guessed
because
it
took
an
awful
while
to
come
up
yes
he
had
been
pulled
out
by
perhaps
it
have
been
a
girl
a
girl
a
perfectly
tremendous
girl
a
regular
giantess
in
fact
she
had
reached
down
with
a
long
arm
and
helped
him
up
a
fishnet
oh
yes
casually
he
believed
there
a
fish
net
where
asked
fairchild
that
dock
oh
i
dunno
just
around
anywhere
there
a
lot
of
docks
in
bancroft
a
fellow
does
look
to
see
which
one
he
but
roger
where
does
the
girl
we
ought
to
do
something
for
her
i
grateful
to
her
you
ought
to
be
too
ca
you
tell
me
where
she
lives
did
ask
her
mumbled
roger
i
just
hiked
for
home
and
you
do
know
her
name
no
said
roger
truthfully
i
did
ask
her
either
i
glad
i
got
my
pole
back
anyhow
roger
said
his
mother
earnestly
hereafter
when
you
go
fishing
i
shall
go
with
you
and
sit
beside
you
on
the
dock
and
hold
on
to
you
another
time
there
might
not
be
a
great
big
strong
girl
on
hand
to
pull
you
out
we
thank
that
girl
i
girls
said
roger
who
had
finally
escaped
from
his
persistent
mother
and
ones
yah
the
girl
that
he
thought
he
hated
most
was
eleven
years
of
age
and
small
at
that
yet
because
of
her
carefree
outdoor
life
she
was
wiry
and
strong
as
active
too
as
a
squirrel
also
she
did
a
great
deal
of
thinking
little
jeanne
duval
loved
the
old
wharf
because
it
was
all
so
beautiful
she
liked
the
soft
blackness
of
the
cindery
soil
that
covered
the
most
sheltered
portions
of
the
dock
she
liked
the
little
sloping
banks
that
had
formed
at
the
inner
sides
of
the
dock
where
it
touched
the
cinder
pond
she
liked
to
lie
flat
near
the
steep
straight
outer
edge
of
the
dock
to
look
into
the
green
mysterious
depths
below
might
be
down
in
that
deep
deep
water
the
cinder
pond
was
different
it
was
shallow
the
water
was
warmer
than
that
in
the
lake
and
very
much
quieter
there
were
small
fish
in
it
and
a
great
many
minnows
and
in
one
sunny
corner
there
were
pollywogs
and
lively
crawfish
also
bloodsuckers
that
were
not
so
pleasant
and
a
great
many
interesting
then
there
were
flowers
wherever
there
was
a
handful
of
soil
seeds
had
sprouted
each
spring
brought
new
treasures
to
the
old
dock
each
year
the
soil
crept
further
lakeward
though
the
planking
was
still
visible
at
the
duval
corner
of
the
wharf
the
flowers
near
the
shore
were
wonderful
pink
and
white
clover
with
roses
bluebells
daisies
susans
wild
forgetmenots
violets
and
sometimes
seeds
from
the
distant
gardens
on
the
high
bluff
back
of
the
lake
were
carried
down
by
the
north
wind
for
one
summer
she
had
found
a
great
scarlet
poppy
another
time
a
sturdy
marigold
what
she
liked
best
perhaps
was
a
picture
that
was
visible
from
a
certain
point
on
lake
street
that
portion
of
the
street
for
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
was
a
poor
road
at
that
there
were
no
houses
and
the
road
was
seldom
used
from
it
however
one
saw
the
tall
old
outlined
against
the
sky
the
long
low
dock
with
its
fringe
of
green
shrubbery
reflected
in
the
quiet
waters
of
the
cinder
pond
and
beyond
the
big
lake
now
blue
now
green
or
perhaps
beaten
to
a
froth
by
storm
jeanne
that
lake
seen
from
that
distance
even
the
rambling
shack
that
her
father
had
built
was
beautiful
because
its
sagging
irregular
roof
made
it
picturesque
jeanne
could
have
told
you
this
quiet
spot
was
beautiful
but
that
was
the
reason
on
the
portion
of
the
dock
that
ran
eastward
from
the
duval
house
there
were
a
number
of
the
big
reels
on
which
fishermen
wind
their
nets
these
seen
from
the
proper
angle
made
another
picture
they
were
used
by
her
father
barney
turcott
and
captain
blossom
barney
and
old
captain
as
everybody
called
captain
blossom
were
her
partners
in
the
fishing
business
two
of
them
went
out
daily
to
the
nets
anchored
several
miles
below
the
town
of
bancroft
the
third
partner
stayed
on
or
near
the
wharf
to
sell
fish
to
the
chance
customers
who
came
rather
rarely
indeed
on
foot
in
a
creaking
leisurely
wagon
or
perhaps
in
a
small
boat
from
one
of
the
big
steamers
docked
across
the
bay
jeanne
playfellows
were
her
michael
aged
eight
sammy
aged
five
and
patsy
who
was
not
quite
two
also
her
annie
whose
years
were
three
and
a
half
jeanne
and
her
father
were
french
her
stepgrandmother
said
her
stepmother
mollie
and
all
her
children
were
mostly
irish
but
said
jeanne
a
wise
little
person
for
her
years
i
love
those
children
just
as
much
as
if
we
were
all
one
kind
chapter
iii
jeannette
queer
family
although
it
was
picturesque
the
duval
shack
was
not
at
all
nice
to
live
in
perhaps
one
person
or
even
two
persons
might
have
found
it
comfortable
but
the
entire
mostly
untidy
duval
family
filled
it
to
overflowing
the
main
room
which
had
been
built
first
was
kitchen
parlor
and
it
contained
a
bunk
besides
in
which
duval
slept
south
of
it
but
with
no
door
between
was
léon
duval
own
room
around
the
corner
and
at
some
little
distance
was
a
north
of
the
main
room
toward
land
there
was
a
small
bedroom
north
of
that
another
small
bedroom
doors
connected
these
bedrooms
with
the
main
room
and
each
contained
two
bunks
filled
with
straw
jeannette
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
wondering
about
her
family
first
there
was
her
precious
father
belonged
to
her
his
speech
was
different
from
that
of
mollie
her
stepmother
it
differed
too
from
the
rough
speech
of
the
other
fishermen
that
sometimes
dried
their
nets
on
the
dock
or
came
there
to
nets
even
old
captain
who
lived
in
part
of
an
old
freight
car
on
the
shore
near
the
and
who
was
very
gentle
and
polite
to
little
girls
was
less
careful
in
his
speech
than
was
léon
duval
her
father
manners
were
nice
indeed
jeanne
could
see
that
they
sometimes
surprised
persons
who
came
to
buy
fish
sometimes
when
the
old
grandmother
wished
to
be
particularly
offensive
she
called
jeanne
father
a
gentleman
old
captain
too
had
assured
her
that
léon
duval
was
a
gentleman
no
one
however
accused
mollie
of
being
a
lady
slipshod
as
to
speech
untidy
unwashed
uneducated
and
most
appallingly
lazy
mollie
shifted
the
burden
of
her
children
upon
jeanne
who
had
cared
for
in
turn
each
of
the
four
babies
fortunately
jeanne
liked
babies
mollie
and
her
mother
shannon
did
the
housework
with
much
assistance
from
the
children
in
the
evening
duval
sat
apart
in
the
small
room
next
to
the
with
his
book
he
read
a
great
many
books
some
written
in
french
some
in
english
he
obtained
them
from
the
city
library
he
read
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
carefully
filled
and
trimmed
by
his
own
neat
hands
this
tiny
room
with
no
floor
but
the
planking
of
the
dock
with
only
rough
boards
over
which
newspapers
had
been
pasted
for
sidewalls
and
ceiling
with
no
furniture
but
a
single
cot
a
small
trunk
a
large
box
and
three
smaller
ones
was
always
scrupulously
clean
it
was
léon
duval
own
room
like
léon
himself
it
was
small
and
absolutely
neat
jeannette
and
old
captain
were
the
only
two
other
persons
permitted
to
enter
that
room
in
it
the
little
girl
had
learned
to
read
to
do
small
problems
in
arithmetic
even
to
gain
some
knowledge
of
history
and
geography
she
had
never
gone
to
school
first
it
was
too
far
next
mollie
had
needed
her
to
help
with
the
children
besides
she
had
had
no
clothes
mollie
children
had
no
clothes
to
do
mollie
justice
she
was
quite
as
kind
to
jeannette
as
to
her
own
youngsters
in
fact
she
was
kinder
because
she
admired
the
little
girl
very
pleasing
face
her
soft
black
eyes
and
the
dark
hair
that
curled
she
jeanne
she
was
anything
but
a
stepmother
she
had
proved
a
poor
one
nevertheless
mollie
was
thoroughly
and
completely
lazy
she
would
work
she
said
she
work
mollie
mother
was
just
about
as
shiftless
but
for
her
there
was
some
excuse
she
was
crippled
with
rheumatism
she
was
also
exceedingly
cross
jeannette
was
fond
of
mollie
but
she
disliked
her
stepgrandmother
very
much
indeed
most
everybody
did
jeanne
could
remember
when
there
had
been
a
heavy
baby
to
move
from
place
to
place
on
the
old
wharf
as
she
picked
flowers
watched
pollywogs
turn
into
frogs
or
talked
to
old
captain
she
mind
carrying
babies
but
her
father
disliked
having
her
do
it
do
carry
that
child
jeanne
he
would
say
it
is
good
for
your
back
make
him
walk
he
big
enough
if
he
ca
walk
teach
him
to
crawl
the
good
god
knows
that
he
can
not
hurt
his
clothes
old
captain
and
léon
duval
were
great
friends
at
first
they
had
been
rivals
in
business
the
captain
with
a
in
one
end
of
his
freight
car
duval
with
a
on
the
wharf
before
long
however
they
went
into
partnership
a
good
thing
for
duval
who
was
a
poor
business
man
and
not
so
bad
a
thing
for
the
captain
what
are
you
captain
asked
jeannette
one
day
when
her
old
friend
was
busy
repairing
a
net
well
returned
old
captain
with
a
twinkle
in
his
fine
blue
eye
some
folks
takes
to
makin
music
some
folks
takes
to
makin
money
some
folks
takes
to
makin
trouble
but
i
just
naturally
takes
to
boats
i
allus
had
kind
of
a
boat
bein
as
how
it
was
boat
of
course
i
was
captain
was
i
so
that
how
did
you
ever
have
any
wives
just
one
replied
old
captain
who
loved
the
sound
of
soft
earnest
little
voice
one
were
enough
still
i
not
complainin
if
i
been
real
pleased
with
that
one
maybe
i
have
tried
another
i
was
spared
that
supposing
a
beautiful
lady
with
blue
eyes
and
golden
hair
should
come
walking
down
the
dock
and
ask
you
to
marry
her
queried
jeanne
what
then
i
hope
i
have
sense
enough
to
jump
in
the
lake
chuckled
old
captain
oh
cried
jeanne
seriously
i
do
hope
she
wo
come
i
was
only
thinking
how
glad
you
be
to
have
her
boil
potatoes
for
you
so
they
be
hot
when
you
got
home
most
like
she
eat
them
all
herself
an
she
make
things
hotter
than
i
like
old
captain
eyes
were
so
blue
that
strangers
looked
at
them
a
second
time
to
make
certain
that
they
were
not
two
bits
of
summer
sky
set
in
captain
blossom
good
red
face
once
his
hair
had
been
bright
yellow
the
fringe
that
was
left
was
now
mostly
white
he
was
a
large
man
nearly
twice
as
large
jeanne
thought
as
her
father
he
was
too
of
course
not
twice
as
good
as
her
good
father
because
she
would
admit
that
anybody
be
better
than
her
beloved
daddy
as
captain
blossom
said
some
people
take
to
music
others
to
boats
old
captain
however
took
to
both
but
he
had
but
one
song
its
chorus
bawled
forth
in
the
captain
big
rather
tuneful
voice
ran
thus
we
sailors
skip
aloft
to
reef
the
gallant
ship
while
the
landlubbers
lie
down
below
below
while
the
landlubbers
lie
down
below
jeanne
hoped
fervently
that
was
not
a
landlubber
one
day
she
asked
old
captain
about
it
what
said
he
when
you
lives
on
a
dock
no
indeed
he
assured
her
you
the
kind
that
skips
up
aloft
one
evening
when
the
sun
was
going
down
behind
that
portion
of
the
town
directly
west
from
the
duval
shack
and
all
the
roofs
and
spires
were
against
a
glowing
orange
sky
jeanne
seized
sammy
and
annie
and
calling
michael
to
follow
raced
up
the
dock
toward
the
huge
old
furnace
she
was
careful
never
to
go
close
to
that
because
old
captain
had
warned
her
that
it
was
unsafe
so
she
paused
with
her
charges
at
a
point
where
the
dock
joined
the
land
she
loved
that
particular
spot
because
the
dock
at
that
point
was
wider
than
at
any
other
place
it
had
been
wider
to
begin
with
then
tons
of
cinders
had
been
dumped
into
the
cinder
pond
and
into
the
lake
on
either
side
of
the
wharf
filling
in
the
corners
this
made
wide
and
pleasing
curves
rather
than
sharp
angles
at
the
joining
place
now
mike
said
she
you
sit
down
and
watch
the
top
of
that
chimney
and
you
sit
here
sammy
where
you
ca
fall
in
look
up
there
annie
what
do
you
see
birdses
lisped
annie
gee
at
the
birds
exclaimed
michael
wait
till
i
shy
a
rock
at
them
no
you
do
replied
jeanne
firmly
those
are
old
captain
birds
i
tell
him
to
thrash
you
if
you
bother
them
he
showed
them
to
me
last
night
now
watch
everybody
watched
the
birds
were
flying
in
a
wide
circle
above
the
top
of
the
old
chimney
they
had
formed
themselves
into
a
regular
procession
they
circled
and
circled
and
circled
and
all
the
time
more
birds
arrived
to
join
the
procession
they
were
twittering
in
a
curious
excited
way
this
lasted
for
at
least
ten
minutes
then
suddenly
part
of
the
huge
circle
seemed
to
touch
the
chimney
top
why
gasped
michael
they
look
as
if
they
were
pouring
themselves
right
into
that
chimney
like
like
like
so
much
water
yes
they
really
going
in
see
they
almost
gone
they
putting
themselves
to
bed
they
chimney
swallows
they
sleep
in
there
see
there
two
belated
birds
too
late
to
join
the
procession
scurried
out
of
the
darkening
sky
and
twittering
frenziedly
hurled
themselves
into
the
mouth
of
the
towering
stack
they
policemen
said
michael
they
sent
all
the
others
to
jail
then
what
about
that
one
asked
jeanne
as
a
last
lone
bird
all
but
shrieking
as
it
scurried
through
the
sky
hurled
itself
down
the
chimney
one
almost
got
caught
said
sammy
see
there
a
big
bird
that
was
chasing
it
a
said
jeanne
old
captain
says
there
always
late
bird
and
one
big
hawk
to
chase
it
now
we
must
hurry
back
it
soon
be
dark
as
the
old
wharf
owing
to
the
rotting
of
the
thick
planking
under
the
cinders
was
full
of
pitfalls
even
by
daylight
the
children
hurried
back
to
their
home
chattering
about
the
swallows
will
they
do
it
again
tomorrow
night
asked
michael
yes
old
captain
says
they
do
it
every
night
all
summer
long
their
home
early
in
the
spring
there
only
a
few
but
as
the
summer
goes
on
there
are
more
and
more
will
oo
take
us
to

iv

old
trunk
where

from
the
doorway
of
the
shack

and
put
sammy
and
annie

up
town
after

along

now
here
barney
with
the
boat
her
family
tucked
into
bed
jeanne
slipped
into
her
father
room
here
i
am
said
she
i
not
a
bit
sleepy
so
you
can
teach
me
a
lot
jeanne
seated
herself
on
her
father
little
old
leather
trunk
the
trunk
that
was
always
locked
and
patted
it
with
her
hands
there
my
spelling
book
on
the
table
daddy
there
a
nice
pink
clover
marking
the
place
her
father
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
before
reaching
for
the
book
he
to
look
at
her
it
was
one
of
his
few
pleasures
a
soft
clear
red
glowed
in
her
dark
cheeks
and
her
eyes
were
very
bright
and
very
black
she
was
small
and
of
slender
build
but
she
seemed
sufficiently
healthy
father
why
do
i
have
to
speak
a
language
from
mollie
she
had
never
called
her
stepmother
by
any
other
name
since
her
fastidious
father
had
objected
to
maw
what
difference
does
it
make
anyway
if
i
say
i
it
or
i
it
here
was
rebellion
her
small
dark
father
looked
at
her
again
this
time
not
so
contentedly
arise
from
that
trunk
said
duval
whose
speech
retained
a
slight
foreign
touch
that
most
people
found
most
pleasing
i
think
i
shall
have
to
show
you
something
that
i
have
been
keeping
for
you
jeannette
hopped
up
gleefully
she
had
always
wondered
what
that
trunk
contained
now
it
seemed
she
was
about
to
find
out
from
a
crack
in
the
wall
duval
fished
a
small
key
fitted
it
to
the
lock
turned
it
and
lifted
the
lid
there
was
a
tray
containing
a
few
packages
of
letters
and
a
small
box
her
father
opened
the
little
box
and
drew
from
it
something
that
had
once
been
white
but
was
now
yellow
something
wonderfully
fine
and
exquisite
with
a
strange
faint
perfume
about
it
a
lace
handkerchief
even
jeanne
who
knew
nothing
of
laces
felt
that
there
was
something
especially
fine
and
beautiful
about
the
filmy
thing
in
her
hands
was
it
was
it
your
mother
assented
duval
is
it
like
anything
of
mollie
well
your
mother
was
like
mollie
she
was
fine
and
exquisite
like
this
little
bit
of
lace
now
here
is
something
else
for
you
to
see
duval
placed
in
his
daughter
hand
a
small
oval
frame
containing
a
wonderful
bit
of
painting
a
woman
beautiful
face
the
countenance
of
a
very
woman
with
a
tender
light
in
her
brown
eyes
and
a
pretty
mouth
and
oh
such
dainty
garments
so
becomingly
worn
your
mother
said
the
little
man
briefly
why
gasped
jeanne
she
was
a
yes
admitted
her
father
she
was
a
lady
and
when
she
died
you
married
when
she
died
i
died
too
i
think
i
was
ill
ill
i
walked
through
the
streets
with
you
in
my
arms
one
day
here
in
this
strange
town
when
your
mother
sickness
compelled
her
to
leave
the
steamboat
you
were
two
years
old
in
my
illness
i
fell
in
the
street
near
the
door
of
mollie
mother
house
near
the
cemetery
where
they
had
laid
your
most
beautiful
mother
they
took
me
in
and
cared
for
me
and
for
you
for
weeks
i
was
very
very
ill
a
fever
i
did
not
improve
i
to
die
but
slowly
very
slowly
i
grew
better
your
mother
had
married
against
her
father
wishes
her
father
i
knew
would
not
receive
you
and
would
ask
no
favors
mollie
was
young
then
and
very
good
to
you
i
knew
almost
nothing
about
her
except
that
she
was
giving
you
a
mother
care
for
that
reason
when
shannon
said
it
was
the
thing
to
do
i
married
her
you
understand
my
jeanne
it
was
not
because
i
cared
for
it
was
just
because
i
cared
for
in
the
whole
world
perhaps
not
even
very
much
for
you
i
seemed
to
be
asleep
numb
and
weak
it
was
two
years
before
i
realized
what
i
had
done
for
myself
then
it
was
too
late
of
course
i
could
not
take
mollie
and
her
mother
to
the
town
where
i
had
lived
with
your
mother
so
i
was
obliged
to
find
work
here
i
tried
to
be
good
to
mollie
she
has
always
been
kind
to
you
and
now
do
you
know
why
i
want
speech
to
be
different
from
mollie
yes
yes
cried
jeanne
i
say
done
it
again
or
should
have
went
or
ai
got
no
money
oh
i
i
said
them
daddy
do
you
i
grow
up
to
be
a
her
father
looked
at
the
eager
young
creature
yes
he
said
i
believe
there
a
way
but
it
a
hard
way
for
one
of
us
if
the
one
said
jeanne
i
guess
i
stay
just
me
and
be
a
lady
anyhow
a
girl
has
to
grow
up
first
does
she
of
returned
duval
with
a
sudden
brightness
in
his
dark
eyes
and
something
very
like
a
note
of
relief
in
his
tone
still
time
for
you
to
do
a
lot
of
growing
but
these
things
had
to
be
said
now
let
us
put
the
treasures
away
and
do
our
spelling
or
old
captain
will
get
here
and
put
an
end
to
our
lessons
will
you
show
me
the
picture
again
some
day
daddy
some
day
he
promised
opening
the
spelling
book
at
the
pink
clover
the
next
day
was
bright
the
weather
was
warm
and
the
little
duvals
to
put
it
frankly
were
very
very
dirty
jeanne
who
had
charge
of
the
family
while
lazy
mollie
dozed
in
one
of
the
frowzy
bunks
decided
to
give
her
charges
a
bath
there
was
a
beautiful
spot
for
the
purpose
along
the
edge
of
the
cinder
pond
the
bottom
at
that
place
was
really
quite
smooth
and
sandy
a
tiny
bit
of
beach
had
formed
below
the
sloping
bank
of
fine
cinders
and
never
were
young
trees
more
useful
than
those
in
the
two
clumps
of
shrubbery
that
screened
this
little
patch
of
sandy
beach
the
shallow
water
was
pleasantly
warm
me
first
me
first
shrieked
annie
who
had
wriggled
out
of
her
solitary
garment
and
was
already
wading
recklessly
in
ladies
first
said
jeannette
mike
you
and
sammy
go
behind
that
bush
and
undress
then
you
can
paddle
about
until
i
ready
to
soap
you
here
patsy
keep
out
of
the
water
until
i
get
your
clothes
off
there
annie
you
slippery
with
soap
go
roll
in
the
pond
while
i
do
patsy
do
get
too
far
away
sammy
i
want
next
annie
make
big
splash
said
that
youngster
flopping
down
suddenly
annie
jump
like
now
annie
you
hopped
enough
you
watch
patsy
while
i
do
sammy
sammy
come
back
here
michael
bring
sammy
back
goodness
sammy
how
wet
you
are
do
put
your
hands
on
me
wonst
remarked
sammy
eying
the
big
bar
of
yellow
soap
thoughtfully
i
seen
soap
white
and
smelly
the
time
the
boat
with
big
sails
on
it
was
here
once
i
corrected
jeanne
old
captain
said
that
was
a
yacht
i
liked
that
lady
with
little
laughs
all
over
her
face
remember
michael
she
took
us
aboard
and
showed
us
the
inside
my
was
that
grand
she
showed
us
the
gold
beds
and
nice
dishes
and
everything
what
for
did
the
boat
come
asked
sammy
they
broke
something
and
had
to
take
it
to
a
blacksmith
to
be
mended
they
stayed
here
most
all
day
sammy
tried
to
their
smelly
soap
said
michael
aw
i
did
denied
sammy
i
just
licked
it
like
i
done
the
cheese
that
was
on
the
cook
table
he
gim
me
the
cheese
but
i
ruther
the
soap
it
tasted
better
you
sure
soap
teased
michael
i
like
to
be
all
smiling
on
my
face
like
that
pretty
lady
said
jeanne
wistfully
and
she
had
any
holes
in
her
clothes
got
a
pretty
face
assured
annie
patting
it
with
one
plump
hand
so
have
you
when
it
clean
why
do
you
wash
it
yourself
as
i
do
mine
i
sure
you
big
enough
nuffin
to
wipe
it
on
objected
annie
this
was
true
the
family
towel
was
a
filthy
affair
when
there
one
even
if
mollie
had
had
money
it
is
doubtful
if
she
would
have
spent
it
for
towels
as
for
anything
it
was
much
easier
to
tuck
it
into
the
stove
or
to
drop
it
into
the
lake
mollie
simply
wash
and
since
shannon
hands
had
become
crippled
with
rheumatism
she
could
jeannette
however
washed
her
own
shabby
dress
her
father
washed
and
mended
his
own
socks
and
shirts
also
he
had
towels
for
his
own
personal
use
and
those
he
managed
to
launder
somehow
time
and
again
he
had
provided
towels
and
for
his
family
but
mollie
who
grew
lazier
with
every
breath
she
drew
had
taken
no
care
of
them
one
by
one
they
had
disappeared
i
think
said
jeannette
wisely
that
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
if
i
knew
how
to
sew
then
perhaps
father
could
get
me
some
cloth
and
i
could
make
things
i
love
to
have
nice
clothes
ladies
contributed
michael
wears
a
lot
of
white
things
under
their
dresses
twenty
at
a
time
i
guess
i
seen
on
a
clothesline
the
lady
what
was
hangin
up
says
you
trow
no
mud
on
them
mud
corrected
jeanne
patiently
and
not
seen
the
lady
said
mud
insisted
michael
then
maybe
she
was
a
truly
lady
sometimes
you
see
a
truly
lady
in
a
little
gold
frame
and
never
says
done
it
how
she
demanded
practical
michael
to
whom
jeanne
had
intrusted
the
cake
of
soap
in
order
that
he
might
lather
himself
while
she
rinsed
annie
hair
for
this
process
annie
sat
in
the
cinder
pond
whose
waters
were
so
placid
that
even
when
the
lake
outside
was
exceedingly
rough
there
were
no
treacherous
waves
to
trouble
small
children
both
boys
could
swim
jeanne
too
could
swim
a
little
but
was
too
timid
to
venture
into
very
deep
water
there
said
michael
returning
the
precious
cake
gim
me
the
rag
and
i
rub
if
i
to
here
sammy
i
rub
first
aw
no
protested
sammy
backing
away
let
sister
do
it
she
rubs
the
bath
lasted
a
good
long
time
because
the
worst
of
the
agony
over
the
happy
youngsters
wished
to
play
in
the
water
it
was
only
with
great
difficulty
that
jeanne
finally
coaxed
her
charges
back
into
their
clothes
i
do
blame
you
she
mourned
for
hating
them
i
wish
you
had
some
clean
ones
mollie
was
peeling
potatoes
outside
the
cabin
door
when
jeanne
returned
home
with
her
spotless
family
she
was
peeling
the
vegetables
wastefully
as
usual
mollie
could
go
everlastingly
without
things
she
could
economize
or
take
care
of
what
she
had
or
at
least
she
did
mollie
said
jeanne
i
been
thinking
that
i
like
to
sew
could
you
teach
me
do
you
me
could
sew
laughed
mollie
her
soft
fat
body
shaking
as
she
laughed
i
never
did
sew
ma
always
done
all
that
i
could
tie
a
bow
to
pin
on
a
hat
maybe
but
lordy
i
cut
out
a
handkercher
shannon
in
spite
of
the
warm
sunshine
sat
inside
huddled
over
the
stove
her
fingers
were
drawn
out
of
shape
with
rheumatism
her
knees
and
her
elbows
were
stiff
she
sat
with
her
back
bent
out
of
her
shriveled
unlovely
face
her
eyes
gleamed
balefully
granny
asked
jeannette
rather
doubtfully
could
teach
me
to
sew
i
could
but
i
wo
snapped
the
old
woman
let
your
father
do
it
your
young
one
if
he
make
money
like
a
man
ought
to
you
could
buy
clothes
but
he
ai
no
and
he
never
will
be
jeanne
backed
hastily
out
of
the
shack
even
when
shannon
said
pleasant
things
which
was
not
very
often
she
had
a
rasping
unpleasant
voice
clearly
there
was
no
hope
in
quarter
chapter
v
the
sewing
lesson
jeanne
father
was
out
in
the
fishing
boat
with
barney
but
old
captain
was
mending
a
net
near
the
door
of
his
perhaps
could
help
her
with
this
new
and
perplexing
problem
she
would
ask
so
with
her
family
trailing
behind
she
paid
a
visit
to
the
captain
captain
said
she
can
you
mend
anything
besides
nets
men
pants
returned
old
captain
briefly
could
you
anything
a
shirt
you
know
or
or
an
apron
well
replied
the
captain
doubtfully
i
could
sew
up
a
seam
maybe
if
somebody
cut
the
darned
thing
hum
ladies
present
the
thing
out
could
you
teach
to
sew
a
seam
you
see
these
children
have
a
single
clean
thing
to
put
on
if
i
could
sew
i
could
make
clothes
for
them
i
believe
because
i
daddy
would
buy
me
some
cloth
well
now
jeannie
if
you
could
manage
to
get
the
needle
threaded
that
there
what
gets
me
hold
on
i
got
a
one
somewhere
now
where
did
i
put
that
needle
old
captain
rose
ponderously
to
his
feet
shuffled
about
inside
his
cabin
and
finally
returned
with
a
large
spool
of
dingy
thread
a
mammoth
thimble
and
a
huge
darning
needle
also
he
had
found
a
piece
of
an
old
flour
sack
now
sit
down
aside
me
here
and
i
show
you
first
you
ties
a
knot
oh
no
first
you
threads
the
needle
like
this
well
by
gum
went
in
did
she
an
you
ties
the
knot
a
good
big
so
she
wo
slip
out
then
you
lays
the
edges
of
the
cloth
together
like
this
and
you
pokes
the
needle
through
here
you
sammy
you
get
your
nose
pricked
illustration
the
sewing
lesson
inquisitive
sammy
retired
so
hastily
that
he
fell
over
backward
now
you
pull
up
the
slack
like
this
hey
mike
i
get
you
say
boys
you
sheer
off
a
bit
while
this
here
goin
on
i
dangerous
with
this
here
tool
what
do
you
do
with
the
thimble
asked
jeanne
when
she
had
removed
placid
annie
to
a
safe
distance
durned
if
i
did
forget
that
you
puts
it
on
this
here
finger
no
well
now
you
puts
it
on
finger
and
uses
it
to
push
the
needle
like
that
how
do
you
it
on
asked
jeanne
twirling
it
rapidly
on
an
upraised
finger
i
guess
you
better
use
the
side
of
this
here
freight
car
like
i
allus
does
admitted
old
captain
just
push
her
in
like
that
now
try
jeanne
sewed
for
a
while
according
to
these
instructions
then
handed
the
result
to
her
teacher
the
captain
beamed
as
he
examined
the
seam
ai
that
just
plum
beautiful
said
he
showing
it
to
michael
that
little
gal
can
but
i
ai
just
sure
them
is
the
right
tools
this
here
seam
in
my
shirt
now
well
it
ai
so
goldarned
hum
hum
ladies
present
so
tarnation
thick
as
that
there
what
i
taught
ye
at
their
worst
the
good
old
captain
mild
oaths
were
never
very
bad
unhappily
jeanne
had
heard
far
more
terrifying
ones
from
sailors
on
passing
boats
as
you
see
captain
blossom
to
use
his
very
best
language
in
the
children
presence
but
his
best
perhaps
was
quite
as
polished
as
léon
duval
i
do
see
any
large
black
knots
in
your
shirt
seam
observed
jeanne
mine
look
as
if
they
maybe
they
cuts
off
returned
the
captain
eying
the
seam
doubtfully
no
by
gum
this
here
done
by
machine
yours
is
all
right
for
hand
work
but
i
tell
ye
what
jeannie
you
come
round
about
this
time
tomorry
and
maybe
by
then
i
can
find
better
needles
an
there
was
a
sleeve
i
tore
off
an
old
shirt
maybe
that
sew
better
i
always
wondered
said
jeanne
how
people
made
buttonholes
they
such
things
can
make
buttonholes
to
be
sure
i
can
nothin
easier
you
cuts
a
round
hole
and
then
you
takes
half
hitches
all
around
it
i
a
leetle
out
of
practice
just
now
but
when
i
practiced
a
bit
you
see
you
got
to
get
started
just
right
but
it
pretty
soon
to
be
thinkin
about
the
buttonholes
do
you
makes
the
holes
to
fit
the
buttons
or
do
you
buy
the
buttons
to
fit
the
holes
well
replied
the
captain
scratching
his
head
mostly
i
makes
the
holes
first
like
and
then
i
fits
the
buttons
to
that
what
i
done
on
this
here
vest
you
see
the
natural
ones
was
too
small
besides
i
lost
the
buttons
fust
lick
interested
jeanne
examined
old
captain
shabby
waistcoat
there
was
a
very
large
black
button
to
fit
a
very
large
buttonhole
next
a
small
white
button
with
a
buttonhole
of
corresponding
size
then
a
very
bright
blue
button
with
a
hole
to
match
that
the
other
two
buttons
were
gone
but
the
store
buttonholes
remained
three
buttons
as
long
as
they
enough
explained
old
captain
is
enough
to
keep
that
there
vest
on
the
rest
is
run
along
now
but
mind
you
come
tomorry
and
we
have
them
other
tools
i
will
promised
jeanne

promised
annie

said
sammie
how
about
mike
laughed
old
captain
aw
would
sew
that
girls
work
the
children
had
no
sooner
departed
than
old
captain
washed
his
hands
and
hurried
into
his
coat
feeling
in
his
pocket
to
make
sure
that
his
money
was
there
he
clambered
up
the
steep
bank
back
of
his
queer
house
to
the
road
above
this
was
a
pleasant
road
because
it
curved
obligingly
to
fit
the
shore
line
the
absence
of
a
sidewalk
did
not
distress
old
captain
half
an
hour
later
jeanne
friend
having
reached
the
business
section
of
the
town
peered
eagerly
in
at
the
shop
windows
there
seemed
to
be
everything
else
in
them
except
the
articles
that
he
wanted
presently
choosing
the
shop
that
had
the
windows
he
started
in
collided
with
a
lady
and
a
baby
carriage
and
backed
out
again
he
mopped
his
bald
pink
head
several
times
with
his
faded
red
handkerchief
before
he
felt
sufficiently
courageous
to
make
a
second
attempt
finally
he
got
inside
tarnation
he
breathed
this
ai
no
place
for
a
man
i
the
only
one
a
moment
later
however
he
caught
sight
of
a
male
clerk
and
started
for
him
almost
on
a
run
he
clutched
him
by
the
sleeve
say
said
old
captain
gim
me
a
thimble
a
spool
o
thread
to
fit
and
a
whole
package
o
needles
this
young
lady
will
attend
to
you
replied
the
man
heartlessly
deserting
him
the
smiling
young
lady
was
evidently
waiting
for
her
unusual
customer
to
speak
so
the
captain
spoke
will
you
kindly
gim
me
a
needle
a
spool
o
thread
an
a
package
o
thimbles
what
exclaimed
the
surprised
clerk
a
thimble
a
needle
a
thread
shouted
the
desperate
captain
what
size
needles
why
about
the
size
you
use
to
sew
a
nice
neat
seam
could
you
mix
up
about
a
quarter
worth
they
in
assorted
packets
what
colored
thread
why
make
it
about
six
colors
just
pick
out
to
suit
yourself
how
about
the
thimble
do
you
want
it
for
yourself
no
it
for
a
girl
about
how
big
a
girl
well
she
some
bigger
than
a
whitefish
said
the
captain
a
bit
doubtfully
but
not
so
much
bigger
than
a
say
how
much
them
thimbles
five
cents
apiece
gim
me
all
the
sizes
you
got
one
of
each
she
might
grow
some
you
know
anything
else
yep
returned
old
captain
suppose
we
match
up
them
spools
with
some
caliker
white
with
red
spots
or
blue
now
what
do
you
say
to
right
this
way
sir
said
the
clerk
gladly
turning
her
back
in
order
to
permit
the
suppressed
giggles
that
were
choking
her
to
escape
the
big
captain
lumbered
along
in
her
wake
like
a
large
scow
towed
by
a
small
tug
he
beamed
in
friendly
fashion
at
the
other
customers
this
dreaded
shopping
was
proving
less
terrifying
than
he
had
feared
his
pilot
came
to
anchor
near
a
table
heaped
with
cheap
print
we
having
a
sale
on
these
goods
said
she
what
the
matter
with
asked
old
captain
suspiciously
why
nothing
replied
the
clerk
they
all
good
how
much
do
you
need
how
many
yards
well
just
about
as
much
and
a
little
over
what
take
for
you
no
need
o
bein
stingy
an
we
got
to
allow
some
for
mistakes
in
cuttin
out
if
you
bought
a
pattern
advised
the
clerk
there
would
be
any
waste
but
said
old
captain
earnestly
she
needs
a
waist
and
a
skirt
too
i
mean
you
would
waste
any
cloth
see
here
our
pattern
book
old
captain
turned
the
pages
doubtfully
suddenly
his
broad
face
broke
into
smiles
well
i
swan
here
she
is
this
is
the
girl
them
things
is
for
same
eyes
same
hair
same
shape
but
queried
the
smiling
clerk
do
you
like
the
way
that
dress
is
made
no
i
do
returned
captain
blossom
it
got
too
many
i
would
know
how
to
make
you
see
i
a
teachin
her
to
sew
finally
by
dint
of
much
questioning
the
girl
arrived
at
the
size
of
the
pattern
required
and
the
number
of
yards
then
old
captain
selected
the
goods
gim
me
a
blue
than
that
he
objected
you
got
to
allow
a
whole
lot
for
to
fade
same
way
with
the
pink
now
that
there
purple
just
right
and
what
the
matter
with
them
red
stripes
and
that
there
white
with
big
black
spots
no
do
gim
me
no
plain
black
i
keep
spool
to
mend
with
now
how
about
buttons
the
young
lady
had
one
lesson
already
on
buttonholes
we
having
a
sale
on
those
too
right
this
way
about
how
many
about
a
pint
i
guess
said
old
captain
and
for
pete
sake
mix
up
as
to
sizes
so
they
fit
all
kinds
of
holes
this
time
the
clerk
giggled
outright
they
on
cards
said
she
here
are
three
sizes
of
white
pearl
buttons
a
dozen
on
each
card
five
cents
a
card
make
it
three
cards
of
each
size
returned
the
captain
promptly
she
might
lose
a
few
and
not
bein
flower
seeds
they
would
sprout
and
grow
now
what
the
damage
for
all
that
the
captain
money
smelled
dreadfully
fishy
like
all
the
rest
of
his
belongings
but
the
good
old
man
did
know
that
he
was
greatly
pleased
with
himself
and
with
his
purchases
but
when
he
reached
the
open
air
he
paused
on
the
doorstep
to
draw
a
deep
breath
a
taken
less
time
to
bought
the
riggin
fer
a
hull
boat
said
he
mopping
his
pink
countenance
but
i
made
a
rare
good
job
of
it
chapter
vi
mollie
when
jeannette
according
to
her
promise
arrived
the
next
afternoon
the
impatient
captain
who
wished
he
had
said
escorted
her
inside
the
old
sammy
and
annie
were
at
her
heels
but
patsy
was
having
a
nap
the
rough
table
was
nicely
decorated
with
folded
squares
of
gorgeous
calico
the
cards
of
buttons
spools
of
thread
and
glittering
thimbles
formed
a
sort
of
fancy
border
along
the
edge
the
packets
of
needles
were
placed
for
safety
in
the
exact
center
of
the
table
them
yourn
said
the
captain
this
here
a
pattern
you
spread
it
on
you
to
see
if
it
fits
it
your
size
but
said
jeanne
i
wanted
the
clothes
for
the
that
all
right
you
cut
it
out
like
this
here
paper
then
you
just
chop
a
piece
off
the
end
wherever
it
too
long
there
enough
for
you
and
the
little
chaps
too
i
get
my
shears
and
we
do
like
it
says
on
the
back
of
the
pattern
the
old
shears
unfortunately
declined
to
cut
but
the
captain
sharpened
the
blade
of
his
and
after
jeanne
had
laid
the
pieces
according
to
the
printed
directions
succeeded
in
hacking
out
the
pink
dress
the
captain
insisted
that
jeanne
should
begin
on
the
pink
one
he
liked
that
best
fortunately
the
shop
girl
had
been
wise
enough
to
choose
a
very
simple
pattern
and
jeanne
was
bright
enough
to
follow
the
simple
rules
with
one
of
them
there
charts
declared
old
captain
admiringly
i
could
make
a
pair
o
pants
or
a
winter
overcoat
all
but
the
sewin
my
kind
all
right
in
summer
but
do
in
winter
wind
get
in
atween
the
stitches
here
you
ai
makin
that
knot
big
enough
do
you
think
a
smaller
one
would
do
asked
jeanne
wistfully
i
do
like
such
big
black
ones
see
this
little
one
does
come
through
when
i
pull
well
just
add
an
extry
hitch
or
two
when
you
begin
that
right
why
you
a
natural
born
sewer
it
was
a
strange
sight
the
big
red
captain
and
the
slight
dark
girl
side
by
side
on
the
old
bench
outside
the
battered
freight
car
old
captain
busy
with
his
net
the
eager
little
girl
busy
with
her
pink
calico
if
it
seemed
almost
pink
she
was
much
too
polite
to
say
so
she
had
decided
that
annie
should
have
the
purple
and
that
sammy
should
have
the
blue
little
patsy
would
mind
the
big
black
spots
as
for
the
red
stripes
that
piece
could
wait
you
see
thought
jeanne
i
ask
father
to
buy
michael
some
regular
boys
clothes
a
pair
of
trousers
anyhow
if
he
does
get
him
a
shirt
too
i
suppose
i
make
him
one
out
of
that
but
i
have
it
for
annie
and
i
do
hope
i
can
squeeze
out
a
pair
of
knickerbockers
for
sammy
there
was
enough
pink
left
for
one
leg
but
i
do
his
blue
clothes
before
i
plan
any
ones
jeanne
fingers
were
as
busy
as
her
thoughts
and
as
the
captain
had
hoped
the
seams
certainly
looked
better
when
done
with
the
proper
tools
i
to
sew
said
jeanne
well
confided
the
captain
i
ca
say
as
how
i
suddenly
wild
shrieks
rent
the
air
sammy
was
jumping
up
and
down
in
a
patch
of
crimson
clover
one
grimy
hand
clasped
a
throbbing
eyelid
sammy
smelled
a
explained
annie
when
jeanne
dropping
her
pink
calico
rushed
to
the
rescue
there
were
many
other
interruptions
happily
not
all
so
painful
before
the
new
garments
were
finished
but
for
many
weeks
jeanne
sewing
traveled
with
her
from
end
to
end
of
the
old
dock
while
she
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
her
restless
small
charges
father
asked
jeanne
one
evening
when
the
pink
dress
was
finished
and
michael
had
received
what
the
captain
called
a
real
pair
of
store
pants
are
michael
and
sammy
and
annie
and
patsy
your
children
too
why
yes
replied
duval
then
why
do
you
take
as
much
pains
with
them
as
you
do
with
me
you
never
scold
michael
for
eating
with
his
knife
or
for
not
being
clean
or
for
saying
bad
words
you
did
like
it
at
all
the
day
i
said
those
bad
words
to
mollie
mother
remember
the
words
i
heard
those
men
say
when
their
boat
ran
into
the
dock
you
said
that
ladies
said
bad
ones
of
course
you
could
make
a
lady
out
of
michael
but
annie
why
it
daddy
well
returned
duval
carefully
shaved
and
very
neat
and
tidy
in
his
shabby
clothes
they
are
mollie
shannon
children
you
are
the
daughter
of
elizabeth
huntington
your
full
name
is
jeannette
huntington
duval
i
want
you
to
live
up
to
that
name
do
you
mean
asked
jeanne
who
was
perched
on
the
old
trunk
that
mollie
children
to
be
like
mollie
something
like
that
admitted
duval
that
a
pity
said
jeanne
i
those
children
they
when
they
clean
and
michael
almost
always
good
to
the
others
perhaps
it
would
be
right
said
her
father
to
make
children
better
than
she
is
they
might
despise
her
and
be
unkind
to
her
it
is
best
i
fear
to
leave
things
as
they
are
do
you
those
other
children
queried
jeanne
you
are
asking
a
great
many
questions
returned
her
father
it
is
my
turn
now
suppose
you
tell
me
through
what
states
the
mississippi
river
flows
duval
admitted
to
himself
however
that
he
did
love
those
other
children
as
he
loved
jeanne
he
tried
hard
in
fact
not
to
hate
them
they
were
so
dreadfully
like
mollie
so
dirty
so
untidy
so
common
dazed
from
his
long
illness
half
crazed
by
the
death
of
his
beautiful
young
wife
he
had
married
mollie
shannon
without
at
all
realizing
what
he
was
doing
he
had
wanted
a
wife
all
he
thought
of
was
a
caretaker
for
wailing
jeannette
who
seemed
to
her
inexperienced
father
a
terrifying
responsibility
mollie
in
her
younger
days
with
a
capable
scheming
mother
to
skillfully
conceal
her
faults
her
indolence
her
untidiness
her
lack
of
education
had
a
fitting
person
for
the
task
of
rearing
jeanne
bolstered
by
her
mother
mollie
looked
not
only
capable
but
even
rather
pleasing
with
the
soothed
and
contented
baby
cuddled
in
her
soft
arms
at
the
moment
the
arrangement
had
seemed
fortunate
for
both
the
duvals
and
the
shannons
duval
however
was
not
really
so
prosperous
as
his
appearance
led
the
shannons
to
believe
he
had
arrived
in
bancroft
with
very
little
money
time
had
proved
to
his
grasping
that
he
was
not
and
never
would
be
a
very
great
success
as
a
some
persons
are
you
know
as
soon
as
shannon
had
fully
grasped
this
disappointing
fact
she
suffered
a
surprising
relapse
she
began
to
show
her
true
colors
her
vile
temper
her
lack
of
breeding
her
innate
coarseness
her
true
colors
in
fact
were
such
displeasing
ones
that
léon
duval
was
not
surprised
to
learn
that
mollie
only
brother
a
lively
and
rather
reckless
lad
by
all
accounts
had
run
away
from
home
at
the
age
of
fourteen
and
was
perhaps
still
running
since
he
had
given
no
proof
of
having
paused
long
enough
to
write
when
his
absence
had
stretched
into
years
shannon
became
convinced
that
john
was
dead
but
mollie
was
not
so
sure
the
runaway
had
had
much
to
forgive
and
the
process
with
resentful
john
would
be
slow
of
course
without
her
mother
aid
mollie
resumed
her
former
slovenly
habits
neglected
her
hair
her
dress
and
her
finger
nails
most
of
her
rather
faint
claim
to
beauty
departed
with
her
neatness
after
a
time
when
his
strength
had
fully
returned
and
his
mental
powers
with
it
duval
realized
that
he
had
made
a
very
dreadful
mistake
in
marrying
mollie
but
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
that
he
could
do
about
it
after
all
the
only
thing
in
life
that
he
had
ever
really
cared
for
was
buried
in
elizabeth
huntington
grave
at
first
jeanne
had
been
precious
only
because
she
was
daughter
as
for
mollie
children
they
were
simply
little
pieces
of
mollie
with
the
years
mollie
had
grown
so
unlovely
that
one
really
could
expect
a
fastidious
person
to
like
four
small
copies
of
her
unfortunately
perhaps
léon
duval
was
a
fastidious
person
shannon
perpetually
crouched
over
the
battered
stove
for
warmth
had
a
grievance
if
duval
earned
half
as
much
as
any
other
fisherman
around
here
said
she
in
her
harsh
disagreeable
voice
we
be
livin
in
a
real
house
on
dry
land
and
what
more
mollie
you
ai
gettin
all
he
earns
he
savin
on
you
he
got
money
in
the
bank
i
seen
a
bankbook
out
of
his
pocket
you
ai
gettin
what
you
ought
to
have
i
you
ai
leave
me
be
returned
mollie
we
gets
enough
to
eat
and
a
body
wants
to
cook
clothes
is
a
bother
any
way
you
want
to
look
at
he
fer
declared
the
old
lady
fair
to
you
fair
to
your
children
well
said
mollie
waking
up
for
a
moment
i
dunno
as
i
blame
him
i
likes
jeanne
better
myself
she
got
jeanne
has
an
always
been
a
child
with
nice
ways
with
her
neither
me
nor
mine
has
much
more
looks
nor
a
lump
o
putty
you
have
if
you
was
tidy
well
i
ai
returned
mollie
truthfully
you
got
to
lace
yourself
in
an
keep
buttoned
up
tight
an
wear
tight
shoes
an
keep
your
stockings
fastened
up
an
your
head
full
o
hairpins
if
you
wants
to
look
neat
when
you
fat
like
i
be
i
hates
all
of
them
things
ruther
be
comfortable
jeanne
had
often
wondered
how
soft
plump
mollie
be
comfortable
with
strands
of
red
hair
straggling
about
her
face
with
her
fat
neck
exposed
to
the
weather
her
uncorseted
figure
billowing
under
her
shapeless
wrapper
her
feet
scuffling
about
in
shoes
several
times
too
large
even
when
dressed
for
the
street
she
was
not
much
neater
but
that
was
mollie
gentle
as
she
was
and
thoroughly
it
was
as
impossible
to
stir
her
to
action
as
it
was
to
upset
her
serenity
as
for
wrath
mollie
simply
had
any
you
could
burn
the
house
down
declared
shannon
an
crawl
into
the
cinder
pond
an
set
there
an
her
paw
died
just
because
he
was
too
lazy
to
stay
alive
and
she
just
like
him
red
hair
and
all
if
it
was
red
hair
there
be
some
get
up
and
go
to
them
shannons
but
it
it
just
red
with
yaller
streaks
when
annie
hair
has
just
been
washed
championed
jeanne
after
one
of
shannon
outbursts
against
the
family
locks
lovely
and
if
sammy
ever
had
a
lazy
hair
in
head
i
guess
michael
pulled
it
out
that
time
they
had
a
about
the
where
sammy
now
asked
his
grandmother
suspiciously
safe
to
leave
him
alone
a
minute
he
always
pryin
into
things
he
and
michael
are
trying
to
pull
a
board
off
the
dock
for
firewood
that
was
one
convenient
thing
about
the
wharf
you
could
live
on
it
and
use
it
for
firewood
too
provided
you
were
careful
not
to
take
portions
on
which
one
needed
to
walk
to
anyone
but
the
duvals
however
most
of
the
dock
presented
a
most
uninviting
surface
a
dangerous
one
in
fact
if
you
stepped
on
the
end
of
a
plank
it
was
quite
apt
to
go
down
like
a
dropping
you
into
the
lake
below
if
you
stepped
in
the
middle
just
as
likely
as
not
your
foot
would
go
through
the
decayed
board
but
only
the
long
portion
running
east
and
west
was
really
dangerous
the
section
between
the
duvals
and
dry
land
owing
to
the
accumulation
of
cinders
and
soil
bound
together
with
roots
of
growing
plants
was
fairly
safe
of
course
said
jeanne
who
sometimes
wished
for
patsy
sake
that
there
were
fewer
holes
in
the
wharf
if
it
were
a
dock
we
would
be
allowed
to
live
on
it
and
if
people
walk
on
it
people
and
that
would
spoil
it
for
us
as
it
is
it
just
the
loveliest
spot
in
the
whole
world
chapter
vii
a
matter
of
coats
shannon
had
been
right
about
duval
he
saving
money
also
it
was
for
jeanne
or
at
least
for
a
purpose
that
closely
concerned
that
little
maiden
what
shannon
had
not
guessed
was
the
fact
that
old
captain
and
duval
had
discovered
or
rather
had
been
discovered
by
two
places
willing
to
pay
good
prices
for
their
excellent
whitefish
and
trout
the
of
a
certain
hotel
noted
for
planked
whitefish
gave
a
standing
order
for
fish
of
a
certain
size
and
a
certain
steward
having
once
tasted
that
delicious
planked
fish
discovered
where
it
was
to
be
obtained
in
a
raw
state
and
thereafter
twice
a
week
ordered
a
supply
for
his
car
the
townspeople
moreover
liked
to
buy
fish
from
old
captain
queer
shop
in
the
end
of
his
freight
car
the
third
partner
barney
turcott
whose
old
sailboat
had
been
equipped
with
a
gasoline
motor
had
been
fortunate
in
his
catches
altogether
the
season
was
proving
a
satisfactory
one
sometimes
duval
looked
at
his
bankbook
and
sighed
he
had
vowed
to
save
the
money
because
it
was
to
save
it
for
the
unhappy
purpose
for
which
he
wanted
it
but
when
he
should
have
enough
duval
could
not
bear
to
think
of
that
moment
it
meant
a
tremendous
sacrifice
a
horrible
wrench
yet
every
penny
except
what
was
actually
needed
for
food
went
into
the
bank
and
the
fund
was
growing
almost
rapidly
for
comfort
one
evening
when
jeanne
stepped
over
the
high
threshold
of
her
little
room
for
her
lesson
no
matter
how
tired
the
fisherman
might
be
the
daily
lesson
was
never
omitted
she
found
duval
kneeling
beside
the
little
old
trunk
it
was
open
and
the
tray
had
been
lifted
out
from
the
depths
below
her
father
had
taken
a
number
of
fine
white
shirts
what
old
captain
called
shirts
a
pair
of
shoes
that
could
have
been
made
for
no
other
feet
than
léon
duval
they
were
so
small
so
trim
and
yet
so
masculine
stood
on
the
table
beside
them
were
two
pairs
of
socks
of
finest
silk
had
jeanne
but
known
it
still
in
the
trunk
were
several
neckties
a
suit
of
fine
underwear
also
a
suit
of
men
clothing
duval
carefully
lifted
out
the
coat
and
slipped
it
on
it
fitted
him
very
well
tell
me
little
one
said
duval
eagerly
if
it
looks
to
you
like
the
coats
worn
by
the
men
of
today
i
i
do
think
i
very
many
men
that
is
to
notice
their
clothes
said
jeanne
nor
i
said
her
father
i
am
on
the
lake
daytimes
where
the
are
apt
to
wear
white
flannels
and
are
nineteen
years
of
age
often
there
is
a
pink
parasol
the
fashions
i
fear
are
not
for
a
man
of
my
sober
years
in
the
evening
the
man
is
either
indoors
or
in
his
overcoat
i
think
i
must
ask
you
to
do
me
a
favor
i
love
to
daddy
what
is
it
tomorrow
you
will
be
taking
this
book
back
to
the
library
for
me
on
the
way
there
and
on
your
way
back
through
the
town
whenever
you
can
walk
behind
a
gentleman
i
want
you
to
study
the
seams
and
the
tails
of
the
coat
now
look
well
at
these
duval
decidedly
dandified
in
his
good
coat
turned
his
back
to
his
daughter
observe
the
seams
said
he
the
length
of
the
tails
the
set
of
the
sleeves
at
the
shoulder
at
the
cut
also
in
front
at
the
number
of
buttons
tomorrow
you
must
observe
these
same
matters
in
the
coats
of
other
men
above
all
my
jeanne
do
not
seem
to
stare
but
keep
your
eyes
open
i
will
daddy
i
know
exactly
what
you
mean
when
i
made
this
pink
dress
for
myself
and
the
things
for
annie
and
sammy
i
looked
at
the
clothes
on
other
children
to
see
how
wide
to
make
the
hems
how
long
to
make
the
sleeves
how
high
to
make
the
necks
and
where
to
make
things
and
you
made
a
very
good
job
of
it
all
too
my
little
woman
i
am
proud
of
your
skill
with
the
needle
and
greatly
obliged
to
your
good
friend
old
captain
now
look
again
at
the
seams
in
the
back
and
then
for
our
lesson
but
first
bring
a
plate
of
water
and
a
large
spoon
i
will
teach
you
how
to
eat
soup
the
garments
were
put
away
and
the
trunk
closed
by
the
time
jeanne
returned
the
soup
lesson
amused
her
greatly
i
can
eat
it
much
she
said
the
way
sammy
does
and
hard
is
it
not
to
make
a
single
bit
of
noise
i
think
i
getting
lessons
sitting
with
both
feet
on
the
floor
and
standing
with
my
shoulders
straight
and
cleaning
my
finger
nails
every
day
and
brushing
my
teeth
and
holding
my
fork
and
last
night
it
was
writing
letters
i
liked
to
do
that
there
is
much
more
that
i
teach
you
my
jeannette
that
i
am
unable
i
am
behind
the
times
fashions
have
changed
only
a
gentlewoman
could
give
you
the
things
that
you
need
but
books
and
life
ah
well
little
jeanne
some
day
you
shall
be
your
mother
true
daughter
and
i
shall
have
done
one
good
deed
at
a
very
great
cost
but
take
away
these
dishes
you
have
eaten
all
your
soup
it
was
pretty
soup
laughed
jeanne
what
are
we
to
try
next
another
letter
i
think
that
good
said
jeanne
i
like
to
do
letters
but
i
afraid
i
forget
and
wipe
my
pen
on
this
pink
dress
i
almost
did
last
time
the
next
day
jeanne
remembered
about
the
coat
unfortunately
it
was
a
warm
day
and
an
inconvenient
number
of
men
had
removed
their
coats
and
were
carrying
them
over
their
arms
but
those
were
mostly
stout
men
she
was
much
more
interested
in
short
slender
ones
happily
a
few
of
slight
build
were
able
to
endure
their
coats
jeanne
inquisitive
eyes
all
but
bored
twin
holes
in
the
backs
of
a
number
of
very
good
garments
at
first
she
had
been
very
cautious
but
presently
she
became
so
interested
in
her
queer
pursuit
that
she
forgot
that
the
clothes
contained
flesh
and
blood
persons
finally
a
sauntering
young
man
wheeled
suddenly
to
catch
her
very
close
to
his
heels
say
said
he
grinning
at
her
i
walked
twice
around
this
triangle
to
see
if
you
were
really
following
me
what
the
object
it
it
your
coat
explained
jeanne
turning
very
crimson
under
her
dusky
skin
my
coat
what
the
matter
with
my
coat
the
the
style
what
is
it
stylish
enough
to
suit
you
it
the
i
i
using
them
for
a
pattern
ah
i
see
behold
the
lady
tailor
planning
a
suit
of
clothes
for
her
husband
i
any
husband
denied
jeanne
indignantly
i
too
young
to
be
married
but
i
awfully
glad
to
see
the
of
your
coat
i
seen
a
great
many
backs
but
it
harder
to
get
a
good
look
at
fronts
queer
little
kid
said
the
young
man
pausing
to
watch
jeanne
sudden
flight
down
the
street
pretty
too
with
those
big
black
eyes
looks
like
a
french
child
in
her
flight
jeanne
overtook
a
boy
of
about
her
own
height
but
far
from
her
own
size
he
was
stout
and
he
puffed
as
he
toiled
up
the
hill
where
had
she
seen
that
plump
boy
was
it
yes
it
the
very
boy
she
had
pulled
out
of
the
lake
that
pleasant
day
in
may
when
the
lake
was
still
cold
what
she
do
if
that
grateful
boy
were
to
thank
her
right
there
in
the
street
having
passed
him
she
paused
irresolutely
to
look
at
him
after
all
if
he
wished
to
thank
her
he
might
as
well
have
a
chance
to
get
it
over
but
jeanne
need
have
been
alarmed
roger
glanced
at
her
turned
bright
scarlet
and
dashed
into
the
nearest
shop
jeanne
eying
the
window
wondered
what
business
a
boy
could
possibly
have
in
that
particular
place
so
did
roger
after
he
got
inside
it
was
a
shop
for
ladies
he
bolted
out
tore
past
a
bright
pink
dress
and
plunged
into
a
tobacco
shop
that
at
least
was
a
safe
harbor
for
a
i
guess
said
jeanne
surprised
at
roger
sudden
agility
he
know
me
in
these
clothes
next
time
i
speak
to
him
that
night
jeanne
asked
her
father
to
try
on
the
old
coat
in
order
that
she
might
compare
it
with
those
she
had
seen
he
slipped
it
on
and
turned
so
that
she
might
view
it
from
all
sides
i
afraid
daddy
said
she
sorrowfully
that
none
of
the
coats
are
quite
like
yours
you
have
seams
closer
together
and
not
so
straight
and
your
tails
are
longer
and
you
fold
back
differently
in
front
i
feared
so
said
duval
this
coat
was
not
new
when
i
laid
it
away
and
the
styles
have
changed
perhaps
more
than
i
suspected
i
am
sorry
apologized
jeanne
i
fear
i
am
not
said
duval
with
one
of
his
rare
smiles
you
have
put
off
an
evil
day
for
it
is
too
warm
for
lessons
let
us
pay
old
captain
a
visit
you
must
see
the
big
trout
that
barney
brought
in
today
not
only
barney
big
trout
but
barney
himself
was
at
old
captain
jeanne
liked
barney
he
was
younger
than
either
of
his
partners
and
so
exceedingly
shy
that
he
blushed
whenever
anybody
looked
at
him
but
he
sometimes
brought
candy
to
the
duval
children
and
he
whittled
wonderful
boats
he
never
said
anything
but
he
did
a
great
deal
of
listening
with
his
large
red
ears
this
time
at
sight
of
jeanne
barney
began
to
fumble
awkwardly
at
his
pockets
finally
he
pulled
forth
a
large
bag
of
peanuts
and
a
small
brown
turtle
he
laid
both
in
her
lap
for
by
this
time
jeanne
was
perched
on
the
bench
outside
the
old
car
thank
you
barney
smiled
jeanne
we
have
a
with
the
peanuts
tomorrow
and
i
scoop
out
a
tiny
pond
some
place
for
the
turtle
is
he
lovely
barney
grinned
but
made
no
other
response
i
glad
you
folks
come
chuckled
old
captain
barney
here
has
nigh
about
talked
me
to
death
chapter
viii
a
shopping
expedition
still
it
appeared
even
the
matter
of
the
coat
could
not
put
off
the
evil
day
forever
one
saturday
night
the
only
night
that
stores
were
open
in
bancroft
duval
took
jeanne
to
the
business
section
of
the
town
where
they
entered
the
very
store
in
which
old
captain
had
made
his
purchases
the
month
was
september
and
the
pink
dress
washed
many
times
by
jeanne
herself
and
dried
in
the
full
sunshine
on
the
old
dock
had
faded
to
a
more
becoming
shade
unlike
the
captain
léon
duval
behaved
quite
like
an
ordinary
shopper
he
carried
himself
with
dignity
and
seemed
to
know
exactly
what
he
wanted
he
said
stockings
for
this
little
girl
if
you
please
the
clerk
after
a
hasty
glance
at
the
rather
shabby
garments
of
her
customers
laid
some
cheap
coarse
stockings
on
the
counter
better
ones
said
duval
not
good
enough
said
he
rejecting
a
second
lot
something
thinner
and
finer
yes
these
are
better
four
pairs
please
now
i
shall
want
some
underwear
for
her
or
balbriggan
i
think
also
two
chemises
whatever
petticoats
are
worn
now
and
a
good
serviceable
dress
a
sailor
suit
i
think
and
after
that
shoes
why
daddy
gasped
jeanne
i
thought
you
were
going
to
buy
you
nails
nails
too
perhaps
but
first
these
jeanne
regarded
her
father
thoughtfully
he
had
always
been
very
gentle
with
her
but
of
late
yes
certainly
he
had
been
very
much
kinder
to
her
and
now
all
these
clothes
was
he
perhaps
going
to
send
her
to
a
real
school
the
big
public
school
that
stood
so
high
that
one
could
see
its
distant
roof
from
the
wharf
a
lack
of
proper
clothing
had
heretofore
prevented
her
going
that
the
distance
and
her
usefulness
at
home
she
was
older
now
she
could
manage
the
walk
michael
disliked
the
task
but
he
look
after
the
younger
children
but
with
she
could
go
to
school
that
would
be
splendid
perhaps
in
another
year
michael
could
have
clothes
too
but
how
particular
her
father
was
about
hers
the
chemises
must
have
a
little
fine
lace
on
them
he
said
and
the
petticoats
the
embroidery
must
be
finer
yes
the
blue
serge
dress
with
the
fine
black
braid
on
the
sailor
collar
would
do
nicely
and
next
a
small
neat
hat
jeannette
gasped
again
a
hat
she
had
never
worn
a
hat
except
when
she
had
gone
up
town
and
then
it
had
been
any
special
hat
just
anybody
old
cap
but
of
course
if
she
went
to
school
she
need
a
hat
now
if
you
please
said
duval
we
like
to
see
some
gloves
kid
or
silk
whichever
is
the
more
suitable
it
getting
late
for
silk
maybe
you
better
take
kid
duval
did
take
kid
ones
the
with
many
a
curious
glance
at
her
unusual
customers
fitted
a
pair
of
tan
gloves
to
unaccustomed
fingers
her
fingers
stay
stiff
they
doubled
and
curled
but
at
last
the
gloves
were
on
and
off
again
jeanne
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
then
there
were
shoes
jeanne
was
glad
that
the
holes
in
her
stockings
were
quite
small
ones
supposing
it
had
been
her
other
pair
holes
as
it
was
the
man
to
whom
the
clerk
had
transferred
her
customer
seemed
rather
shocked
to
see
holes
was
it
possible
that
there
were
people
even
entire
families
with
holes
in
their
stockings
the
fat
boy
that
had
tumbled
off
the
wharf
that
morning
and
had
known
her
afterwards
in
the
new
pink
dress
probably
that
fortunate
child
had
whole
stockings
because
everything
else
about
him
seemed
most
gloriously
new
and
whole
but
surely
the
greater
part
of
the
population
went
about
in
holes
mollie
shannon
her
father
even
old
captain
she
had
seen
put
great
patches
in
his
thick
woolen
socks
but
what
was
the
clerk
putting
on
her
feet
she
had
had
shoes
before
thick
and
heavy
and
always
too
large
that
they
might
last
the
longer
mollie
had
bought
them
usually
after
the
first
snow
had
driven
barefooted
jeanne
to
cover
but
never
such
shoes
as
these
soft
smooth
and
only
a
tiny
scrap
longer
than
her
slender
foot
and
oh
so
softly
black
and
then
a
dreadful
thought
daddy
said
jeanne
i
just
love
these
shoes
for
but
afraid
they
wo
you
see
sammy
gets
them
next
they
shoes
these
are
shoes
not
sammy
replied
her
father
when
duval
had
paid
for
all
the
wonderful
things
they
were
tied
in
three
big
parcels
jeanne
carried
one
her
father
carried
two
it
was
dark
and
quite
late
when
they
finally
reached
the
wharf
we
will
say
nothing
about
this
at
home
said
duval
when
jeanne
proposed
stopping
to
show
the
things
to
old
captain
for
the
present
we
must
hide
them
in
the
old
trunk
i
have
no
wish
to
talk
about
this
matter
with
anybody
it
concerns
nobody
but
us
two
can
you
keep
the
secret
even
from
old
captain
why
i
so
will
it
be
long
i
afraid
it
will
bubble
and
bubble
until
somebody
hears
it
and
oh
that
darling
hat
not
long
i
fear
i
try
promised
jeanne
give
me
that
package
now
run
along
to
bed
i
guess
everybody
else
is
asleep
it
was
a
long
time
before
excited
jeanne
was
able
to
sleep
however
one
by
one
she
was
recalling
the
new
garments
she
wished
that
she
might
have
had
the
new
shoes
under
her
pillow
for
just
that
one
night
perhaps
the
only
thing
that
saved
the
secret
next
day
was
the
wonderful
tale
that
she
told
the
children
after
she
had
led
them
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
old
wharf
the
beautiful
princess
said
she
wore
a
lovely
white
thing
called
a
chemise
the
thing
there
ever
was
it
was
trimmed
with
lovely
lace
that
had
a
blue
ribbon
run
through
it
there
was
a
beautiful
white
petticoat
over
that
and
on
top
of
a
dress
what
for
asked
sammy
the
inquisitive
did
she
cover
up
her
pretty
chemise
with
all
those
things
was
she
cold
oh
no
only
a
chemise
is
to
wear
i
glad
i
not
a
princess
said
michael
botherin
all
the
time
with
blue
ribbons
did
she
wear
no
crown
crown
no
she
had
just
a
little
dark
blue
hat
the
very
color
of
her
dress
some
brown
gloves
and
oh
the
shoes
they
fitted
her
feet
just
like
skin
and
she
had
stockings
aw
cut
out
her
clothes
said
michael
what
did
she
school
had
started
jeanne
knew
it
because
on
her
last
trip
to
the
library
she
had
met
a
long
procession
of
boys
and
girls
hurrying
homeward
chattering
as
only
school
children
can
chatter
but
still
duval
had
said
nothing
to
jeannette
about
to
school
the
home
lessons
went
on
as
usual
and
the
wondering
pupil
hoped
fervently
that
she
was
not
outgrowing
that
hidden
wardrobe
would
be
too
dreadful
the
following
saturday
evening
duval
shopped
again
this
time
he
went
alone
returning
with
more
bundles
these
too
were
concealed
the
wharf
afforded
many
a
convenient
hiding
place
under
its
old
planks
and
this
time
even
jeanne
failed
to
suspect
that
anything
unusual
had
happened
during
the
evening
there
were
never
any
lessons
saturday
night
and
this
particular
evening
she
had
been
glad
of
the
extra
time
she
was
finishing
the
extra
dress
she
had
started
for
annie
the
red
and
white
striped
calico
mollie
was
in
bed
and
asleep
shannon
was
dozing
over
the
stove
jeanne
sat
close
to
the
lamp
pushing
her
needle
through
the
stiff
cloth
there
breathed
jeanne
thankfully
the
last
button
on
tomorrow
i
dress
annie
up
and
take
her
to
call
on
old
captain
he
like
her
because
she
look
so
much
like
the
american
flag
chapter
ix
the
flight
tuesday
had
been
a
wonderful
day
never
had
the
lake
or
the
sky
seemed
so
softly
blue
the
air
so
pleasant
or
the
green
bushes
so
nearly
like
real
trees
the
two
boys
had
been
good
all
day
and
annie
and
patsy
had
been
there
had
been
a
late
wild
rose
on
the
bush
near
old
captain
freight
car
a
deep
rose
streaked
with
crimson
the
captain
heavy
and
clumsy
had
scrambled
up
the
bank
to
pluck
it
for
jeannette
who
had
placed
it
carefully
in
a
green
glass
bottle
on
her
little
table
her
lesson
the
night
before
had
been
a
queer
one
her
father
had
taught
her
how
to
dress
herself
in
the
new
garments
also
he
had
given
her
an
obviously
new
brush
and
comb
and
had
compelled
her
to
use
them
to
reduce
her
hair
to
a
state
of
unaccustomed
order
that
had
taken
a
long
time
because
when
you
have
been
using
a
very
old
brush
and
an
almost
toothless
comb
your
hair
does
get
snarled
in
spite
of
you
her
lessons
were
getting
so
queer
in
fact
that
she
could
help
wondering
what
would
come
next
what
came
was
the
queerest
thing
of
all
the
rose
in
the
green
glass
bottle
on
her
father
table
filled
the
little
room
with
fragrance
again
the
door
was
fastened
and
the
lid
of
the
trunk
cautiously
lifted
fix
your
hair
as
you
did
last
night
directed
duval
in
an
odd
rather
choked
voice
put
on
your
clothes
just
as
you
did
last
night
be
very
quiet
about
it
you
were
in
the
pond
today
yes
daddy
good
then
you
are
clean
i
will
wait
outside
until
you
are
dressed
are
we
going
some
place
daddy
yes
replied
her
father
who
had
taken
a
parcel
from
the
box
on
which
he
usually
sat
dress
quickly
but
neatly
and
put
on
your
hat
put
the
gloves
in
your
pocket
then
sit
quietly
here
until
i
come
for
you
eyes
shining
pulses
leaping
jeannette
got
into
her
new
garments
but
where
were
the
extra
ones
that
had
been
in
the
trunk
the
two
frilly
the
other
chemise
the
other
petticoat
the
extra
stockings
never
mind
her
father
she
was
sure
had
taken
good
care
of
them
there
my
hair
going
better
time
and
my
feet
feel
more
at
home
in
these
shoes
and
oh
my
white
white
petticoat
how
you
are
i
had
truly
things
i
suppose
a
real
princess
has
heaps
and
heaps
of
them
duval
had
neglected
to
supply
it
is
quite
possible
that
he
did
know
that
little
girls
stockings
were
fastened
that
way
motherless
jeanne
certainly
did
mollie
were
never
fastened
at
all
old
shannon
tied
with
a
string
jeannette
found
two
bits
of
raveled
rope
hanging
from
a
nail
they
she
thought
would
answer
the
purpose
it
only
for
this
evening
said
jeanne
eying
with
dissatisfaction
the
bits
of
frayed
rope
i
find
something
better
tomorrow
some
nice
pieces
of
pink
calico
like
my
dress
maybe
next
she
got
into
the
pretty
sailor
suit
and
smoothed
it
into
place
then
the
good
little
dark
blue
hat
was
put
on
very
carefully
last
of
all
jeanne
lifted
down
the
small
cheap
mirror
that
hung
on
the
rough
wall
i
certainly
do
look
said
she
i
think
elizabeth
huntington
would
like
me
most
anybody
would
have
thought
the
same
thing
certainly
her
father
did
when
a
moment
later
he
opened
the
door
turn
out
the
light
said
he
it
is
time
to
start
the
pair
stole
silently
along
the
pier
to
the
low
place
where
roger
fairchild
had
climbed
out
of
the
lake
here
a
small
boat
awaited
them
in
it
were
two
rectangular
objects
that
jeanne
did
not
recognize
they
were
piled
one
on
top
of
the
other
and
the
little
girl
was
to
sit
on
them
blushing
barney
turcott
had
the
oars
evidently
he
was
to
do
the
rowing
duval
climbed
in
and
took
the
rudder
strings
they
were
some
distance
from
the
dock
with
the
boat
headed
toward
the
twinkling
lights
of
bancroft
before
anybody
said
a
word
after
that
while
the
men
talked
of
fish
of
nets
and
of
prices
investigating
fingers
stole
over
the
surface
of
the
objects
on
which
she
sat
until
finally
she
discovered
handles
and
straps
they
were
suitcases
people
coming
out
of
the
bancroft
station
sometimes
carried
them
was
it
possible
that
she
was
to
ride
on
a
train
or
on
one
of
the
big
lake
steamers
that
came
four
times
a
week
to
the
big
dock
across
the
bay
in
the
harbor
of
bancroft
she
who
had
never
ridden
in
much
of
anything
where
she
be
going
when
they
disembarked
near
the
foot
of
main
street
duval
handed
a
letter
to
barney
turcott
please
hand
this
to
duval
tomorrow
morning
said
he
barney
nodded
then
for
once
he
talked
pleasant
journey
sir
said
he
jeanne
i
suppose
said
duval
taking
the
suitcases
come
jeanne
we
must
hurry
jeanne
wondered
what
barney
had
supposed
i
have
our
tickets
said
duval
as
the
pair
entered
the
station
jeanne
blinking
at
the
lights
like
a
little
owl
come
this
way
our
train
is
over
here
lower
five
and
six
said
he
to
the
colored
man
who
stood
beside
the
train
jeanne
wondered
if
the
colored
gentleman
owned
it
she
would
ask
her
father
later
then
they
were
inside
her
eyes
having
become
accustomed
to
the
light
jeanne
was
using
them
she
did
know
which
was
the
more
astonishing
the
inside
of
the
coach
or
her
father
like
herself
duval
was
clad
throughout
in
new
garments
he
wore
them
well
too
spotless
collar
and
cuffs
good
shoes
and
socks
and
a
suit
that
had
the
right
number
of
seams
in
the
proper
places
he
was
all
right
behind
he
was
all
right
in
front
jeanne
eyed
him
with
pride
and
pleasure
why
father
she
said
you
do
even
of
fish
i
glad
to
hear
it
said
he
his
eyes
very
bright
and
shining
before
i
came
to
bancroft
i
was
dressed
every
day
like
this
like
a
gentleman
so
you
like
me
this
way
eh
that
way
and
way
she
said
but
father
where
are
we
going
you
will
sleep
better
if
i
tell
you
nothing
tonight
worry
that
all
but
daddy
are
we
going
to
here
i
do
see
any
beds
presently
however
the
porter
began
pulling
beds
right
out
of
the
air
or
so
it
seemed
to
jeanne
some
came
down
out
of
the
ceiling
some
came
up
out
of
the
floor
and
there
you
were
surrounded
by
beds
oh
what
a
fairy
story
to
tell
the
children
a
few
whispered
instructions
and
jeanne
knew
how
to
prepare
for
bed
and
how
to
get
up
in
the
morning
also
what
to
do
with
her
clothes
we
change
in
chicago
in
the
morning
added
her
father
so
you
must
hop
up
quickly
when
i
call
you
jeanne
could
hardly
sleep
for
the
joy
of
her
lovely
white
never
had
the
neglectful
shannons
provided
her
with
anything
so
white
and
soft
and
lovely
as
that
for
let
alone
night
disturbing
too
was
the
motion
of
the
train
the
alarming
things
that
rushed
by
in
the
darkness
the
horrible
grinding
noises
underneath
as
if
the
train
were
breaking
in
two
and
shrieking
for
help
how
one
sleep
but
finally
she
did
and
then
her
father
hand
was
on
her
shoulder
after
that
only
half
awake
she
was
getting
into
her
clothes
oh
a
jiggly
troublesome
business
and
one
rope
garter
had
broken
right
in
two
next
they
were
off
the
train
and
eating
breakfast
in
a
great
big
noisy
station
that
seemed
to
be
moving
like
the
cars
jeanne
was
whisked
from
this
into
something
that
really
moved
a
taxicab
after
that
another
train
a
coach
her
father
said
jeannette
was
thankful
that
she
did
have
to
go
to
bed
in
but
oh
how
her
head
whirled
and
now
with
the
darkness
gone
all
the
world
was
whizzing
past
her
window
a
shabby
world
of
untidy
backyards
and
houses
huddled
horribly
close
together
at
least
the
duvals
had
had
no
untidy
neighbors
and
certainly
there
had
been
plenty
of
elbow
room
but
now
the
houses
were
farther
apart
presently
there
were
none
the
country
oh
that
was
better
if
one
could
only
walk
along
that
woodsy
road
or
play
in
that
pleasant
field
jeanne
said
duval
touching
her
hand
softly
i
tell
you
now
where
we
are
going
it
happens
that
you
have
a
grandfather
his
name
is
william
huntington
your
mother
father
you
know
some
weeks
ago
i
wrote
to
an
old
friend
to
ask
if
he
were
still
living
he
is
your
mother
brother
charles
and
his
family
live
with
him
a
wife
and
three
children
i
believe
your
aunt
is
undoubtedly
a
lady
since
your
marriage
was
i
understand
pleasing
to
his
family
your
mother
was
away
from
home
at
the
time
of
our
marriage
and
i
met
only
her
parents
afterwards
your
grandfather
i
could
have
liked
had
he
liked
me
your
grandmother
she
is
dead
now
seemed
the
more
unforgiving
yet
neither
forgave
do
they
know
about
asked
jeanne
they
knew
that
you
were
living
at
the
time
of
your
mother
death
i
want
them
to
you
if
they
like
you
it
will
be
a
very
good
thing
for
you
it
is
i
think
the
way
that
i
can
give
you
what
your
mother
would
have
wanted
you
to
have
the
right
surroundings
the
proper
friends
education
accomplishments
you
are
nearly
twelve
and
you
have
had
if
anything
were
to
happen
to
me
i
should
want
you
with
your
mother
people
rather
than
with
mollie
this
visit
will
help
you
i
think
shall
i
like
my
grandfather
and
my
uncle
i
never
had
any
of
you
know
i
hope
so
but
not
as
well
as
you
daddy
not
as
well
we
wo
talk
about
it
any
more
just
now
if
you
please
see
that
load
of
ripe
tomatoes
a
big
wagon
heaped
to
the
top
we
do
have
such
splendid
fruit
in
our
cold
climate
see
there
is
a
farm
perhaps
they
came
from
there
such
big
barns
and
comfortable
houses
daddy
said
jeanne
what
does
a
lady
do
when
her
stocking
keeps
coming
down
and
coming
down
this
morning
i
broke
the
rope
the
rope
exclaimed
astonished
duval
jeanne
hitched
up
her
skirt
to
display
the
remaining
wisp
of
rope
like
that
she
said
my
poor
jeannette
groaned
léon
duval
it
is
certainly
time
that
you
were
with
your
mother
people
you
need
a
gentlewoman
care
but
daddy
you
said
we
be
on
this
train
all
day
and
it
only
nine
now
my
stocking
drops
all
the
way
down
have
you
a
bit
of
anywhere
about
you
not
an

lamented
duval
but
perhaps
the
porter
might
have
a
shoestring
shoestring
yass
suh
said
the
porter
put
it
in
your
shoe
foh
you
suh
no
thank
you
replied
duval
gravely
but
jeannette
giggled
daddy
if
you
spread
your
newspaper
out
a
good
deal
i
think
i
can
fix
it
there
that
ever
so
much
better
they
spent
the
night
in
a
hotel
jeanne
in
a
small
but
clean
room
the
very
cleanest
room
she
had
seen
she
examined
and
counted
the
with
much
interest
and
admired
the
white
counterpane
but
she
liked
the
outside
of
her
snowy
bed
better
than
the
inside
after
she
had
crawled
in
between
the
clammy
sheets
i
wish
shivered
jeanne
that
annie
and
sammy
were
here
with
me
or
even
patsy
if
he
wiggle
it
so
smooth
and
cold
i
believe
i
like
smooth
cold
places
poor
little
cinder
from
the
cinder
pond
she
was
to
find
other
smooth
cold
places
and
to
learn
that
there
were
smooth
cold
persons
even
harder
to
endure
than
chilly
beds
chapter
x
the
arrival
in
the
morning
jeanne
dressed
again
in
her
new
clothes
then
the
travelers
had
breakfast
by
this
time
you
may
be
sure
jeanne
was
very
grateful
for
her
father
past
instructions
in
table
manners
they
had
proved
particularly
useful
in
the
where
duval
had
added
a
few
more
lessons
to
fit
napkins
and
lamb
chops
after
a
leisurely
meal
they
got
into
a
street
car
in
which
they
rode
for
perhaps
twenty
minutes
along
paved
streets
lined
with
high
buildings
or
large
houses
very
close
together
then
they
got
out
and
walked
along
several
blocks
of
very
hard
pavement
until
they
came
to
a
large
gray
house
with
a
tall
iron
fence
they
climbed
a
number
of
stone
steps
leading
to
a
tightly
closed
forbidding
door
your
grandfather
lives
here
said
duval
ringing
the
bell
a
very
stiff
butler
opened
the
door
ushered
them
in
and
told
them
to
be
seated
in
a
very
stiff
while
he
presented
the
letter
that
duval
had
handed
him
jeanne
eyed
the
remote
ceiling
with
wonder
and
awe
the
butler
returned
presently
with
six
persons
at
his
heels
they
had
evidently
risen
hastily
from
the
breakfast
table
for
two
of
them
had
brought
their
napkins
with
them
a
very
tremulous
old
man
a
large
rather
handsome
woman
a
stout
but
decidedly
gentleman
two
tall
girls
and
a
boy
all
looking
as
if
they
had
just
had
a
shock
of
some
kind
they
did
not
shake
hands
with
duval
they
all
gazed
instead
at
jeanne
a
great
many
eyes
for
so
small
a
target
jeanne
could
feel
herself
shrinking
under
their
piercing
glances
for
what
seemed
like
a
very
long
time
no
one
spoke
but
oh
how
they
looked
and
looked
and
looked
finally
duval
broke
the
embarrassing
silence
illustration
jeanne
left
alone
with
the
strangers
inspected
them
with
interest
you
have
read
my
letter
he
asked
addressing
the
older
man
yes
then
pardon
me
if
i
suggest
that
you
grant
me
an
interview
apart
from
these
young
people
i
have
much
to
say
to
you
mr
huntington
in
here
said
the
mild
gentleman
opening
a
door
remain
where
you
are
jeannette
prompted
her
father
jeannette
left
alone
with
the
strangers
inspected
them
with
interest
the
girls
looked
like
their
mother
she
decided
rather
smooth
and
polished
on
the
outside
like
whitefish
for
instance
with
round
hard
grayish
eyes
the
boy
eyes
were
different
yellow
she
thought
or
very
pale
brown
his
upper
lip
lifted
in
a
queer
way
as
if
nothing
quite
pleased
him
they
were
all
rather
colorless
as
to
skin
she
had
seen
children
there
had
been
several
on
the
train
in
fact
whose
looks
were
more
pleasing
she
began
to
wonder
after
a
while
if
somebody
ought
not
to
say
something
was
it
place
to
speak
but
she
could
think
of
a
thing
to
say
she
felt
relieved
when
the
three
young
huntingtons
began
to
talk
to
one
another
now
and
again
she
caught
a
familiar
word
but
many
of
their
phrases
were
quite
new
to
her
at
any
rate
they
were
not
speaking
french
she
had
heard
her
father
speak
that
she
had
heard
too
little
slang
to
be
able
to
recognize
or
understand
it
jeanne
had
risen
from
her
chair
because
her
father
had
risen
from
his
she
thought
now
that
perhaps
she
ought
to
resume
her
seat
but
no
one
had
said
as
old
captain
always
did
set
right
down
honey
an
stay
as
long
as
ye
like
visiting
old
captain
was
certainly
much
more
comfortable
still
doubtful
jeanne
took
a
chance
she
backed
up
and
sat
down
but
harold
yielding
to
one
of
his
sudden
malicious
impulses
jerked
the
chair
away
of
course
she
landed
on
the
floor
worst
of
all
her
skirt
pulled
up
and
there
for
all
the
world
to
see
was
a
section
of
frayed
rope
dangling
from
below
her
knee
the
shoestring
showed
too
for
half
a
dozen
seconds
the
young
huntingtons
gazed
in
silence
at
this
remarkable
sight
then
they
burst
into
peals
of
laughter
the
fact
that
jeanne
eyes
filled
with
tears
did
not
distress
them
they
continued
to
laugh
in
a
most
unpleasant
way
jeanne
scrambled
to
her
feet
found
her
chair
and
sat
in
it
who
are
you
anyway
asked
the
boy
the
letter
you
sent
in
gave
the
family
a
shock
all
right
and
we
just
had
another
elastic
must
be
expensive
where
you
came
from
or
is
that
the
last
word
in
hey
girls
his
sisters
tittered
poor
jeanne
writhed
in
her
chair
no
one
had
been
unkind
to
her
even
shannon
whose
tongue
had
been
sharp
had
never
made
her
shrink
like
that
i
am
jeannette
duval
returned
the
unhappy
visitor
my
mother
was
elizabeth
huntington
this
is
where
my
grandfather
lives
goodness
exclaimed
the
taller
of
the
two
girls
whose
name
was
pearl
she
must
be
related
to
elizabeth
huntington
is
the
aunt
that
we
are
allowed
to
mention
is
she
asked
the
younger
girl
yes
returned
the
boy
she
ran
away
and
married
a
frenchman
and
my
grandfather
turned
her
out
that
old
gardener
we
had
two
years
ago
used
to
talk
about
it
said
she
was
the
best
of
all
the
huntingtons
but
of
course
he
was
crazy
say
clara
said
the
older
girl
we
be
late
for
school
you
too
harold
the
three
deserted
jeanne
as
unceremoniously
as
they
did
the
furniture
left
alone
jeanne
looked
about
her
the
floor
was
very
smooth
and
shiny
there
were
rugs
that
looked
as
if
they
might
be
interesting
close
to
there
were
chairs
and
tables
with
very
slender
legs
there
was
a
large
mirror
built
into
the
wall
part
of
the
time
she
had
seen
six
cousins
instead
of
three
and
a
big
fireplace
with
a
mantel
that
a
queer
kind
of
stove
thought
jeanne
noting
the
gas
log
after
a
thousand
years
it
seemed
to
jeanne
the
four
returned
her
father
came
first
you
are
to
stay
here
for
five
years
said
he
taking
her
hands
in
his
after
that
we
shall
see
we
have
all
decided
that
it
is
best
for
you
to
be
here
with
your
mother
people
they
have
consented
to
care
for
you
i
shall
pay
as
i
can
for
what
you
need
for
the
rest
you
will
be
indebted
to
the
kindness
of
your
grandfather
i
need
not
tell
you
my
jeanne
to
be
a
good
girl
you
will
write
to
me
often
and
i
will
write
to
you
and
now
i
must
go
at
once
to
make
my
train
he
kissed
jeanne
first
on
one
cheek
then
on
the
other
then
with
a
gesture
so
graceful
and
comprehensive
that
jeanne
flushed
with
pride
to
see
it
léon
duval
took
leave
of
his
he
a
frenchman
and
i
it
was
her
comforting
thought
poor
child
the
rest
of
her
thoughts
were
not
so
comforting
five
years
not
to
see
her
wonderful
father
again
for
five
years
not
to
see
mollie
or
michael
or
sammy
or
annie
or
patsy
why
patsy
would
be
a
great
big
boy
in
five
years
there
would
be
no
one
to
make
clothes
for
the
children
no
one
to
make
annie
into
a
lady
she
had
firmly
intended
to
do
that
unselfish
mite
that
she
was
her
first
distressing
thoughts
were
for
the
other
children
a
maid
will
come
for
you
presently
said
the
large
smooth
lady
addressing
jeanne
and
will
show
you
your
room
i
will
look
through
your
clothes
later
to
see
what
you
need
i
am
your
aunt
agatha
this
is
your
uncle
charles
this
is
your
grandfather
i
must
go
now
to
see
about
your
room
her
uncle
charles
nodded
carelessly
in
her
direction
looked
at
his
watch
and
followed
his
wife
the
room
to
which
the
maid
escorted
jeanne
was
large
with
cold
gray
walls
a
very
high
ceiling
and
white
doors
the
brass
bed
was
wide
very
white
and
smooth
the
pillows
were
large
and
hard
the
towels
that
hung
beside
the
stationary
basin
looked
stiff
and
uninviting
jeanne
wondered
if
one
were
supposed
to
unfold
those
towels
it
seemed
a
pity
to
wrinkle
their
polished
surface
altogether
it
was
not
a
cosy
room
any
more
than
huntington
was
a
cosy
person
jeanne
turned
hopefully
to
the
large
window
there
was
another
house
very
close
indeed
the
gray
brick
wall
was
not
beautiful
and
the
nearest
window
was
closely
shuttered
where
asked
jeanne
turning
to
the
maid
who
still
lingered
is
the
lake
the
lake
exclaimed
the
maid
why
there
is
any
lake
there
a
small
river
they
say
down
town
somewhere
never
saw
it
pretty
dirty
i
guess
when
your
trunk
comes
push
this
button
and
i
unpack
for
you
if
you
like
there
your
suitcase
you
can
use
these
drawers
for
your
clothes
maybe
you
like
to
put
them
away
yourself
i
go
now
jeanne
was
glad
that
she
had
her
suitcase
to
unpack
it
was
something
to
do
but
when
she
opened
it
kneeling
on
the
floor
for
that
purpose
she
found
that
it
contained
two
articles
that
had
not
been
there
earlier
in
the
morning
she
remembered
that
her
father
had
closed
it
for
her
on
the
train
perhaps
had
put
something
inside
there
was
a
small
new
purse
containing
a
few
coins
two
dollars
altogether
it
seemed
a
tremendous
sum
to
jeanne
the
other
parcel
seemed
vaguely
familiar
jeanne
removed
the
worn
paper
covering
oh
she
breathed
rapturously
there
was
her
mother
beautiful
lace
handkerchief
wrapped
about
the
lovely
little
miniature
of
her
mother
her
father
who
had
cherished
these
treasures
beyond
anything
had
given
them
to
and
he
had
not
told
her
to
take
good
care
of
them
he
had
that
she
would
oh
she
whispered
it
was
of
you
when
jeanne
who
had
had
an
early
breakfast
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
she
was
slowly
but
surely
starving
to
death
the
maid
whose
name
proved
to
be
maggie
escorted
her
to
the
in
spite
of
her
father
instructions
she
made
mistakes
at
the
table
principally
because
there
were
bread
and
butter
knives
and
bouillon
spoons
invented
since
the
days
of
duval
young
manhood
at
least
however
she
did
eat
with
her
knife
unhappily
whenever
she
did
the
wrong
thing
one
or
another
of
her
cousins
laughed
that
made
her
grandfather
frown
some
way
embarrassed
jeanne
was
glad
of
that
she
was
to
learn
that
her
cousins
were
much
better
trained
in
such
matters
as
table
manners
than
in
kind
and
courteous
ways
toward
other
persons
their
mother
was
conventional
at
all
times
she
have
used
the
wrong
fork
but
there
were
certain
persons
who
said
that
huntington
had
the
very
manners
of
anybody
in
her
set
that
she
never
thought
of
anybody
feelings
but
her
own
but
the
lady
was
far
from
suspecting
any
such
state
of
affairs
she
thought
herself
a
nice
lady
and
considered
her
children
most
beautifully
trained
happily
by
watching
the
others
jeanne
naturally
bright
and
quick
soon
learned
to
avoid
mistakes
as
she
was
also
naturally
kind
her
manners
were
really
better
in
a
short
time
than
those
of
the
young
huntingtons
her
new
relatives
particularly
the
younger
ones
asked
her
a
great
many
questions
about
her
former
life
had
she
really
never
been
to
school
were
there
any
schools
was
the
climate
cold
in
northern
michigan
were
the
people
very
uncivilized
were
they
indians
or
esquimaux
what
was
her
home
like
what
was
the
cinder
pond
sometimes
the
children
giggled
over
her
replies
sometimes
they
looked
scornful
almost
always
both
and
huntington
appeared
shocked
it
so
easy
to
guess
what
old
huntington
thought
chapter
xi
a
new
life
at
the
conclusion
of
jeanne
first
uncomfortable
meal
with
her
new
relatives
huntington
detained
the
children
for
a
moment
in
the
next
week
said
she
jeannette
will
be
going
to
school
you
are
not
to
tell
the
other
pupils
nor
any
of
your
friends
nor
the
maids
in
this
house
anything
of
her
former
life
and
you
too
jeannette
will
please
be
silent
concerning
your
poverty
and
the
fact
that
your
father
was
a
common
fishman
gee
scoffed
harold
holding
his
nose
a
fishman
he
was
a
replied
jeanne
loyally
he
was
common
mollie
was
common
but
my
father
was
no
gentleman
be
a
fishman
returned
huntington
who
really
supposed
she
was
telling
the
truth
you
will
remember
i
hope
not
to
mention
his
business
yes
promised
jeanne
meekly
yes
aunt
agatha
prompted
huntington
yes
aunt
agatha
said
jeanne
thoroughly
awed
by
the
large
cold
lady
now
we
will
see
what
you
need
in
the
way
of
clothes
of
course
you
have
nothing
at
all
suitable
jeanne
followed
her
aunt
upstairs
huntington
noted
with
surprise
that
the
garments
in
the
drawers
were
neatly
folded
also
that
they
were
of
astonishing
fineness
did
your
stepmother
buy
these
asked
the
lady
no
my
father
these
handkerchiefs
too
yes
he
bought
but
you
have
only
six
and
not
enough
of
anything
else
and
only
this
one
dress
that
all
father
did
put
any
of
my
old
things
in
they
much
good
i
suppose
annie
will
have
my
pink
dress
huntington
wrote
many
words
on
a
slip
of
paper
i
shall
shop
for
these
things
at
once
said
she
you
need
a
jacket
and
rubbers
before
you
can
go
to
school
of
course
you
have
any
gloves
yes
yes
aunt
agatha
here
in
this
drawer
they
really
very
good
admitted
huntington
but
you
will
need
a
heavier
pair
for
everyday
and
something
for
my
stockings
pleaded
jeanne
i
guess
father
know
what
to
get
you
see
most
of
the
time
i
went
barefoot
mercy
child
gasped
huntington
looking
fearfully
over
her
shoulder
you
must
tell
things
of
that
sort
they
maggie
might
have
you
i
try
not
to
promised
jeanne
but
my
stockings
stay
up
huntington
wrote
another
word
or
two
on
her
list
anything
else
she
asked
things
to
write
a
letter
with
oh
please
aunt
agatha
could
i
have
those
i
want
to
write
to
my
father
he
taught
me
how
you
know
maggie
will
put
writing
materials
in
the
drawer
of
that
table
promised
huntington
i
ring
for
them
now
i
glad
that
you
can
at
least
read
and
write
but
you
not
say
that
word
is
for
servants
i
try
to
remember
promised
jeanne
jeannette
first
letter
to
her
father
would
probably
have
surprised
huntington
had
she
read
it
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
that
she
did
dear
daddy
wrote
jeanne
the
picture
is
safe
the
handkerchief
is
safe
the
purse
is
safe
and
so
am
i
am
safe
i
should
like
to
be
running
on
the
edge
of
the
dock
on
the
dangerous
side
almost
falling
in
see
the
nice
tail
on
the
comma
i
like
to
make
commas
but
i
use
more
periods
the
periods
are
like
frog
eggs
in
the
cinder
pond
but
the
commas
are
like
pollywogs
with
tails
that
how
i
remember
huntington
is
not
like
mollie
mollie
looks
soft
all
over
some
day
i
shall
put
my
finger
very
softly
on
huntington
to
see
if
she
feels
as
hard
as
she
looks
her
back
would
be
safest
i
think
she
is
very
kind
about
giving
me
things
but
i
do
not
know
her
very
well
yet
she
does
not
cuddle
her
children
like
mollie
cuddles
hers
she
is
too
hard
and
smooth
to
cuddle
there
are
little
knives
for
bread
and
butter
and
they
eat
green
leaves
with
a
funny
fork
i
ate
a
round
green
thing
called
an
olive
i
like
it
but
i
did
make
a
face
i
did
know
what
to
do
with
the
seed
so
i
kept
it
in
my
mouth
until
i
had
a
chance
to
throw
it
under
the
table
was
that
right
there
is
no
lake
they
get
water
out
of
pipes
but
not
in
a
pail
hot
and
cold
right
in
my
room
maggie
she
is
the
maid
showed
me
how
to
make
a
light
you
push
a
button
you
push
another
and
the
light
goes
out
she
said
two
years
ago
this
house
was
all
made
over
new
inside
this
is
another
day
my
bed
is
very
big
and
lonesome
i
am
like
a
little
black
huckleberry
in
a
pan
of
milk
when
i
am
in
it
i
can
see
in
the
glass
how
i
look
in
bed
i
have
a
great
many
new
clothes
i
have
tried
them
on
some
do
not
fit
and
must
go
back
i
have
a
brown
dress
it
is
real
silk
to
wear
on
sunday
i
have
a
white
dress
it
looks
like
white
clouds
in
the
sky
and
a
red
jacket
and
more
under
things
but
i
like
the
ones
you
bought
the
best
because
i
like
best
this
is
four
more
days
i
have
been
to
church
i
stood
up
and
sat
down
like
the
others
i
liked
the
feathers
on
the
ladies
hats
and
the
little
boys
in
nightgowns
that
marched
around
and
sang
next
sunday
i
am
to
go
to
sunday
school
huntington
says
i
am
a
heathen
i
got
a
chance
to
touch
her
her
back
hard
now
i
will
say
but
i
like
to
write
to
you
so
i
hate
to
send
it
away
but
i
will
begin
another
letter
right
now
maggie
will
put
this
in
the
letter
box
for
me
i
like
maggie
but
i
am
afraid
i
will
tell
her
about
my
past
life
huntington
says
i
must
never
mention
bare
feet
or
fish
yours
truly
jeannette
huntington
duval
mrs
huntington
told
a
lady
i
was
that
but
know
i
am
just
your
jeanne
i
love
you
better
than
anybody
jeanne
you
will
notice
made
no
complaints
against
her
rude
young
cousins
and
passed
lightly
over
matters
that
had
tried
her
rather
sorely
from
her
letters
her
father
gathered
that
she
was
much
happier
than
she
really
was
perhaps
nobody
enjoyed
a
letter
more
than
duval
enjoyed
that
first
one
he
went
to
the
post
office
to
get
it
because
no
could
be
expected
to
deliver
mail
to
a
shack
on
the
end
of
a
long
dock
he
read
it
in
the
post
office
he
read
it
again
in
old
captain
freight
car
and
when
barney
turcott
came
in
he
too
had
to
hear
it
then
mollie
read
it
and
as
she
read
her
face
was
quite
beautiful
with
the
that
jeanne
liked
it
was
the
only
attractive
thing
about
mollie
then
the
children
awoke
and
sat
up
in
their
bunks
to
hear
it
read
aloud
poor
children
they
could
not
understand
what
had
become
of
their
beloved
jeanne
afterwards
duval
laid
the
letter
away
in
his
shabby
trunk
beside
the
little
green
bottle
that
still
held
a
shriveled
pink
rose
the
late
wild
rose
that
jeanne
had
left
on
his
table
that
last
day
he
had
found
what
remained
of
it
on
his
return
from
his
journey
it
was
certainly
very
lonely
in
that
little
room
evenings
without
those
lessons
jeannette
huntington
duval
found
school
decidedly
trying
at
first
the
pupils
pry
into
her
past
their
questions
were
most
embarrassing
even
the
teachers
puzzled
by
many
contradictory
facts
asked
questions
that
jeanne
could
not
answer
without
mentioning
poverty
or
fish
yes
she
had
lived
in
the
country
on
a
dock
in
the
country
wondered
truthful
jeanne
no
she
did
know
what
a
theater
was
and
she
had
never
had
a
birthday
party
nor
been
to
one
what
did
one
birthday
mean
jeanne
had
asked
how
one
give
her
birthday
away
of
she
knew
all
the
capitals
of
south
america
mountains
and
rivers
too
she
could
draw
maps
showing
them
all
she
to
draw
maps
but
asparagus
what
was
that
and
velvet
and
vanilla
and
plumber
really
said
miss
wardell
one
day
after
a
lesson
in
definitions
you
be
as
ignorant
as
you
seem
you
know
the
meaning
of
such
words
as
jardinière
tapestry
doily
mattress
counterpane
banister
brocade
did
you
live
in
a
house
yes
yes
miss
wardell
stammered
jeanne
coloring
as
a
vision
of
the
duval
shack
presented
itself
did
you
sleep
on
a
mattress
jeanne
hung
her
head
she
had
guessed
that
that
thick
thing
on
her
bed
was
a
mattress
but
how
was
she
to
confess
that
hay
in
a
wooden
bunk
had
been
her
bed
fortunately
jeanne
did
not
like
a
child
who
had
slept
on
hay
she
was
small
and
daintily
built
her
hands
and
feet
were
beautifully
shaped
her
dark
eyes
were
soft
and
very
lovely
her
little
face
decidedly
bright
and
attractive
she
suffered
now
for
affection
for
companionship
for
the
freedom
of
outdoor
life
but
never
for
food
or
for
suitable
garments
it
is
to
be
feared
that
huntington
during
all
the
time
that
she
looked
after
jeannette
put
before
any
other
consideration
the
child
was
always
properly
clad
unfortunately
in
spite
of
all
jeanne
precautions
her
cousins
succeeded
in
dragging
from
her
all
the
details
of
her
former
poverty
they
never
got
her
alone
that
they
did
trap
her
into
telling
things
that
she
had
meant
to
tell
at
those
times
even
harold
seemed
almost
kind
to
her
mean
children
they
were
pumping
her
of
course
but
for
a
long
time
honest
jeanne
did
not
suspect
them
of
any
such
meanness
after
they
had
learned
all
that
there
was
to
know
jeanne
eyes
were
opened
and
things
were
different
sometimes
harold
in
order
to
embarrass
her
told
his
boy
friends
a
weird
tale
about
her
that
our
cousin
the
cinder
pond
savage
harold
would
say
her
only
home
was
a
drygoods
box
on
the
end
of
a
dock
she
sold
fish
for
a
living
and
ate
all
that
were
left
over
she
never
ate
anything
fish
she
had
nineteen
stepsisters
with
red
hair
and
a
cruel
stepmother
who
was
a
witch
she
wore
a
potato
sack
for
a
dress
and
never
saw
a
shoe
in
her
life
until
last
month
when
captured
she
was
fourteen
miles
out
in
the
lake
chasing
a
whale
step
right
this
way
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
see
the
cinder
pond
savage
harold
friends
seemed
to
consider
this
amusing
but
jeanne
found
it
most
embarrassing
the
strange
boys
always
eyed
her
as
if
she
really
were
some
little
wild
thing
in
a
trap
she
did
like
it
clara
put
it
differently
my
cousin
jeanette
huntington
duval
has
always
lived
on
my
uncle
estate
in
the
country
she
did
go
to
school
but
had
lessons
from
a
tutor
but
however
they
put
it
jeannette
realized
that
she
was
considered
a
disgrace
to
the
family
a
relative
of
whom
they
were
all
secretly
ashamed
and
her
father
her
good
wonderful
father
was
considered
a
common
frenchman
who
had
married
her
very
young
mother
solely
because
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
man
i
do
believe
it
said
jeanne
when
clara
told
her
this
my
father
cared
for
money
that
why
he
poor
and
he
much
easier
to
be
friends
with
than
father
and
he
reads
a
great
many
more
books
than
uncle
charles
does
so
i
know
he
is
ignorant
even
if
you
do
think
he
is
besides
he
writes
beautiful
letters
with
semicolons
in
them
did
father
write
to
you
that
time
he
was
gone
all
summer
clara
was
obliged
to
admit
that
he
had
but
then
added
clara
cruelly
a
gentleman
always
hires
a
stenographer
to
write
his
letters
he
does
of
doing
such
things
himself
any
more
than
he
black
his
own
boots
then
said
jeanne
defiantly
i
glad
my
father
just
a
fishman
chapter
xii
a
helpful
grandfather
during
that
first
winter
jeanne
was
fairly
contented
her
school
work
was
new
and
kept
her
fairly
busy
and
in
her
cousins
bookshelves
she
discovered
many
delightful
books
for
boys
and
girls
heretofore
she
had
read
no
stories
she
had
been
too
busy
rearing
mollie
family
shy
and
sensitive
for
several
months
she
made
no
real
friends
among
her
schoolmates
how
she
with
a
horrible
past
to
conceal
to
be
sure
when
she
thought
of
the
big
beautiful
lake
the
summer
days
on
the
old
dock
the
lovely
reflections
in
the
cinder
pond
the
swallows
going
to
bed
in
the
old
furnace
chimney
the
red
sun
going
down
behind
the
distant
town
the
kind
old
captain
the
warm
affection
of
children
not
to
mention
the
daily
companionship
of
her
nice
little
father
it
seemed
as
if
her
past
had
been
anything
horrible
but
no
city
child
she
feared
would
ever
be
able
to
understand
that
when
even
the
could
from
the
very
first
her
uncle
charles
had
seemed
not
to
like
her
and
sometimes
it
seemed
to
jeannette
that
her
aunt
agatha
eyed
her
coldly
and
resentfully
she
could
understand
it
but
james
the
butler
and
maggie
the
maid
sometimes
gossiped
about
it
as
the
best
of
servants
will
gossip
it
like
this
said
james
seating
himself
on
the
corner
of
the
pantry
table
old
huntington
is
the
real
master
of
this
house
young
huntington
comes
next
charles
is
just
a
you
mean
said
maggie
same
thing
now
huntington
owns
all
this
james
comprehensive
gesture
included
a
large
portion
of
the
earth
surface
and
naturally
charles
expects
to
be
the
heir
when
the
old
gentleman
passes
away
now
listen
james
voice
dropped
confidentially
there
a
young
nephew
of
mine
in
ball
and
brewster
one
day
when
he
was
filing
away
a
document
with
the
name
huntington
on
it
he
mentioned
me
being
here
to
another
clerk
old
pitman
it
was
well
old
pitman
said
it
was
himself
that
had
made
a
copy
of
old
huntington
will
leaving
all
that
he
had
to
his
son
charles
now
lookee
here
old
huntington
was
to
soften
toward
his
dead
daughter
for
away
with
that
frenchman
and
was
to
make
a
new
will
leavin
everything
to
his
that
new
little
girl
between
you
and
me
she
a
sight
better
child
than
them
other
three
put
together
he
would
said
maggie
of
course
he
might
leave
her
that
it
mark
my
words
and
charles
ca
warm
to
that
child
because
they
afraid
of
her
afraid
of
what
she
might
get
she
a
frozen
terror
missus
is
well
they
as
cold
to
her
as
a
pair
of
milk
cans
them
two
maybe
that
the
reason
possibly
it
was
and
it
is
quite
possible
too
that
neither
nor
charles
huntington
realized
the
reason
for
their
lack
of
cordiality
only
they
were
cordial
at
first
jeanne
had
seen
but
little
of
her
grandfather
on
pleasant
days
he
sat
with
his
book
in
the
garden
behind
the
house
on
chilly
days
he
sat
alone
in
his
own
where
there
was
a
gas
log
but
sometimes
at
the
table
he
would
ask
jeanne
questions
about
her
school
work
well
jeannette
how
about
school
are
you
learning
a
lot
ever
so
much
jeanne
would
reply
there
are
so
many
things
learn
one
day
when
he
asked
the
usual
question
jeannette
countenance
grew
troubled
next
week
she
confided
we
are
to
have
written
examinations
in
and
there
are
a
thousand
spots
where
i
have
caught
up
with
the
class
mathematics
language
united
states
history
and
french
the
books
are
different
you
see
from
the
ones
i
had
i
have
to
mathematics
are
the
worst
i
do
the
examples
suppose
you
bring
them
to
me
after
lunch
i
used
to
think
i
was
a
mathematician
that
was
the
beginning
of
a
curious
friendship
between
the
little
girl
and
the
very
quiet
old
man
after
that
there
was
hardly
a
day
in
which
jeanne
whose
class
was
ahead
of
her
in
mathematics
did
not
appeal
for
help
she
liked
her
grandfather
he
seemed
nearer
her
own
age
than
anyone
else
in
the
house
you
see
when
people
get
to
be
ninety
or
a
hundred
they
are
able
to
be
friends
with
persons
who
are
only
seventy
or
eighty
a
matter
of
twenty
years
makes
no
difference
at
all
huntington
was
which
is
old
enough
to
enjoy
a
friendship
of
age
but
when
people
are
young
like
pearl
and
clara
two
years
difference
in
their
ages
makes
a
tremendous
barrier
clara
was
almost
three
years
older
than
jeanne
and
pearl
was
fourteen
months
older
than
clara
harold
was
younger
than
his
sisters
but
older
than
jeanne
who
often
seemed
younger
than
her
years
pearl
and
clara
looked
down
with
scorn
upon
child
of
twelve
indeed
they
had
been
born
old
some
children
are
you
know
also
it
seemed
to
their
grandfather
they
had
been
born
for
all
that
they
called
her
the
cinder
pond
savage
jeanne
manners
were
really
very
good
she
seemed
to
know
instinctively
how
to
do
the
right
thing
that
is
after
she
became
a
little
accustomed
to
her
new
way
of
living
and
she
was
always
very
considerate
of
other
people
feelings
so
was
her
grandfather
most
of
the
time
but
huntington
was
and
her
children
were
very
like
her
cold
and
decidedly
snobbish
jeanne
was
quite
certain
that
her
girl
cousins
had
never
harold
to
be
sure
occasionally
played
jokes
on
the
younger
members
of
the
family
or
on
the
servants
but
they
were
usually
rather
cruel
unpleasant
jokes
like
putting
a
rat
in
maggie
bed
or
water
in
pearl
shoes
or
spiders
down
clara
back
for
jeanne
he
reserved
the
pleasant
torture
of
teasing
her
about
her
father
ugh
he
would
say
holding
jeanne
precious
mail
as
far
as
possible
from
him
while
with
the
other
hand
he
held
his
nose
this
must
be
for
you
it
smells
of
fish
your
father
must
have
sold
a
couple
while
he
was
writing
this
sometimes
he
would
point
to
shoe
advertisements
in
the
papers
with
here
your
chance
miss
savage
no
need
to
go
barefoot
when
your
five
years
are
up
just
lay
in
a
whopping
supply
of
shoes
all
sizes
at
his
grandfather
liked
his
youngest
grandchild
manners
he
told
himself
once
he
even
told
his
son
that
he
could
possibly
give
any
affection
to
the
daughter
of
that
wretched
frenchman
who
had
stolen
daughter
perhaps
he
could
just
at
first
no
doubt
he
he
could
but
he
down
in
his
lonesome
old
heart
he
was
glad
that
mathematics
were
hard
for
her
because
he
was
glad
that
she
needed
his
help
just
what
are
you
thinking
asked
her
grandfather
one
day
i
was
making
an
example
explained
jeanne
i
been
here
seven
months
that
leaves
four
years
and
five
months
but
the
last
two
months
went
faster
than
the
first
two
if
five
years
seemed
like
a
thousand
years
to
begin
with
and
the
last
two
months
i
refuse
said
her
grandfather
with
a
sudden
twinkle
in
his
eye
to
tackle
any
such
example
as
that
well
laughed
jeanne
here
another
miss
wardell
asked
us
in
school
today
to
decide
what
we
like
to
do
when
we
grown
up
we
to
tell
her
tomorrow
rather
short
notice
is
it
ye
es
said
jeanne
you
see
ever
since
i
visited
miss
sister
kindergarten
i
thought
i
like
to
teach
but
i
thought
i
like
to
get
married
too
what
gasped
her
grandfather
get
married
i
should
like
to
bring
up
a
family
with
the
proper
tools
old
captain
says
you
have
to
have
the
proper
tools
to
sew
with
think
you
have
to
have
the
proper
tools
to
bring
up
a
family
and
smelly
soap
and
cold
cream
and
underclothes
have
you
picked
out
a
husband
asked
her
grandfather
that
the
worst
of
it
you
have
to
have
one
to
earn
money
to
buy
the
proper
tools
but
it
a
great
nuisance
to
have
a
husband
around
bridget
says
she
had
three
and
she
rather
cook
for
satan
himself
she
says
than
a
husband
jeannette
you
must
repeat
bridget
conversations
does
huntington
like
you
to
talk
to
the
servants
no
returned
jeanne
blushing
a
little
but
but
sometimes
i
just
have
to
talk
you
see
well
you
see
yes
well
bridget
likes
to
be
talked
to
i
not
sure
always
that
anybody
else
well
it
easy
to
talk
to
bridget
how
about
me
you
come
next
assured
jeanne
the
next
day
jeanne
returned
from
school
with
her
big
black
eyes
fairly
sparkling
she
went
at
once
to
her
grandfather
room
i
decided
what
i
going
to
do
said
jeanne
i
going
to
be
married
why
asked
her
grandfather
well
you
see
if
i
had
a
kindergarten
i
could
tuck
the
children
in
at
night
that
the
very
nicest
part
of
children
tucking
them
in
but
the
husband
would
need
to
be
trouble
he
could
stay
away
all
day
like
uncle
charles
does
what
does
uncle
charles
when
he
at
the
club
i
mean
he
is
in
a
bank
from
nine
until
three
every
day
only
that
little
bit
i
guess
i
rather
have
an
iceman
he
gets
up
very
early
and
works
all
day
does
he
anyway
miss
wardell
said
i
did
need
to
worry
about
picking
out
until
i
was
twenty
sometimes
i
wish
aunt
agatha
liked
kittens
and
puppies
do
you
they
so
useful
while
you
waiting
for
your
children
chapter
xiii
banished
friends
i
have
a
letter
from
old
captain
confided
jeanne
that
same
afternoon
do
you
want
to
read
it
you
would
laugh
at
it
you
certainly
i
would
laugh
assured
her
grandfather
taking
the
letter
dear
and
honored
miss
wrote
old
captain
in
a
large
sprawling
hand
this
is
to
let
you
know
that
it
is
a
warm
day
for
april
the
lake
is
still
froze
it
seems
as
if
the
sun
shines
more
when
you
are
here
sammy
lost
his
freckles
for
a
while
but
they
come
back
again
last
week
michael
and
annie
were
here
yestiddy
he
says
your
father
is
teaching
him
to
read
as
i
am
a
better
hand
with
a
than
i
am
with
this
here
pen
i
will
close
so
no
more
at
present
your
true
friend
and
captain
john
blossom
old
captain
my
true
friend
explained
jeanne
he
taught
me
to
make
dresses
and
things
but
i
learned
some
more
things
about
sewing
in
school
i
can
put
in
a
lovely
patch
with
the
checks
and
stripes
all
matching
and
darn
and
hem
and
fell
seams
and
make
buttonholes
old
captain
buttonholes
were
so
funny
he
cut
them
and
all
different
sizes
i
ever
so
glad
michael
is
learning
to
read
it
too
far
for
small
children
to
walk
to
school
besides
their
clothes
well
their
clothes
are
just
right
you
know
i
guess
they
by
this
time
do
you
really
like
those
children
asked
her
grandfather
i
love
them
annie
and
patsy
are
sweet
and
sammy
is
so
funny
he
so
curious
that
he
gets
too
close
to
things
and
either
tumbles
in
or
gets
hurt
once
it
was
a
wasp
i
guess
i
could
live
with
people
and
not
like
them
a
little
then
you
like
your
cousins
i
i
have
lived
with
them
very
long
evaded
jeanne
her
grandfather
chuckled
had
lived
with
them
for
quite
a
while
with
the
coming
of
june
jeanne
began
to
yearn
more
than
ever
for
the
lake
she
told
miss
wardell
about
it
the
day
she
had
to
stay
after
school
to
redraw
her
map
jeannette
asked
the
teacher
what
possessed
you
to
draw
in
all
those
extra
lakes
you
know
there
are
no
lakes
in
kansas
that
why
i
put
them
in
explained
jeanne
earnestly
there
ought
to
be
if
there
were
a
large
lake
in
the
middle
of
each
state
with
all
the
towns
on
the
shore
it
would
be
much
nicer
but
i
did
mean
to
hand
that
map
in
it
was
just
a
play
map
you
see
when
you
ca
have
any
real
water
you
like
to
make
pictures
of
it
are
you
lonesome
for
lake
superior
oh
yes
last
sunday
when
the
minister
read
about
the
flood
i
just
hoped
it
would
happen
again
not
enough
to
drown
folks
you
know
but
enough
to
make
a
lot
of
beautiful
big
lakes
enough
to
go
round
for
everybody
you
been
to
the
park
yes
but
the
lake
there
is
as
big
as
our
cinder
pond
and
its
brick
edges
are
horrid
it
looks
of
course
it
is
artificial
but
it
better
than
none
admitted
jeanne
very
doubtfully
i
guess
i
like
real
ones
best
along
toward
spring
when
her
past
had
become
a
little
more
comfortably
remote
jeanne
had
made
a
number
of
friends
among
her
classmates
she
had
particularly
liked
lizzie
mccoy
because
lizzie
red
hair
was
even
redder
than
that
of
the
young
duvals
and
her
freckles
more
numerous
than
sammy
and
lizzie
had
liked
jeanne
but
when
lizzie
had
ventured
to
present
herself
at
door
she
had
been
ushered
by
james
into
the
where
huntington
inspected
her
coldly
i
came
explained
lizzie
nervously
to
see
jeanne
i
do
seem
to
recall
your
name
mccoy
ah
yes
what
is
your
business
he
a
butcher
returned
lizzie
where
do
you
live
spring
street
huntington
shuddered
fancy
anyone
from
spring
street
venturing
to
ring
at
her
exclusive
portal
jeannette
is
not
at
home
said
she
susie
morris
fared
no
better
susie
was
round
and
pink
and
pleasant
everybody
liked
susie
several
times
she
had
walked
home
with
jeanne
but
they
had
always
parted
at
the
gate
do
come
in
pleaded
jeanne
i
show
you
my
new
party
dress
for
the
dancing
school
party
next
week
you
know
all
right
said
susie
the
dress
was
lovely
susie
admired
it
in
her
shrill
piping
voice
the
sound
of
it
brought
huntington
down
the
hall
to
inspect
the
intruder
jeannette
she
asked
who
this
child
susie
morris
she
in
my
class
what
is
her
father
business
he
a
carpenter
piped
susie
where
do
you
live
asked
huntington
spring
street
confessed
susie
huntington
shuddered
again
child
from
that
horrible
street
a
blind
child
could
have
seen
that
she
was
unwelcome
susie
who
was
far
from
blind
stayed
only
long
enough
to
say
to
jeanne
you
must
be
more
careful
said
huntington
in
your
choice
of
friends
everybody
likes
susie
returned
jeanne
loyally
her
people
are
common
explained
huntington
i
should
be
to
have
you
bring
lydia
coleman
or
ethel
bailey
home
with
you
i
do
like
them
said
jeanne
why
not
there
is
a
bit
of
fun
in
them
declared
jeanne
blushing
because
their
resemblance
to
her
cousins
was
her
real
reason
for
disliking
them
well
there
cora
farnsworth
surely
there
plenty
of
fun
in
cora
i
do
like
cora
either
she
says
mean
things
just
to
funny
explained
jeanne
who
had
often
suffered
from
cora
fun
i
like
that
kind
of
girls
lydia
ethel
and
cora
live
the
returned
huntington
you
to
like
them
at
any
rate
you
must
bring
no
more
east
side
children
home
with
you
i
ca
have
them
in
my
house
huntington
always
talked
about
the
avenue
as
bridget
who
was
very
religious
talked
of
heaven
when
their
ship
came
in
huntington
said
they
should
have
a
home
in
the
avenue
the
old
house
they
were
in
she
said
was
quite
impossible
old
huntington
jeanne
gathered
did
not
wish
to
move
to
the
more
fashionable
street
jeanne
wondered
about
that
ship
of
aunt
agatha
the
river
she
had
seen
it
once
was
a
small
muddy
affair
surely
no
ship
that
could
sail
up
that
shallow
stream
would
be
worth
waiting
for
she
asked
her
grandfather
about
it
her
grandfather
frowned
we
wo
talk
about
that
ship
said
he
i
do
like
it
do
you
like
boats
asked
jeanne
very
much
but
not
that
kind
jeanne
was
usually
a
very
child
but
one
saturday
in
june
she
fell
from
grace
an
visitor
a
very
uninteresting
friend
of
huntington
had
expressed
a
wish
to
see
the
park
pearl
clara
and
jeanne
were
sent
to
escort
her
there
it
was
rather
a
bracing
day
walking
sedately
along
the
cement
walks
seemed
to
jeanne
a
very
tame
occupation
presently
she
lagged
behind
to
feed
the
crumbs
she
had
thoughtfully
concealed
in
her
pocket
to
a
sad
squirrel
with
a
skinny
tail
he
was
not
half
as
nice
as
the
chipmunks
that
sometimes
scampered
out
on
the
cinder
pond
dock
but
he
reminded
her
of
those
cheerful
animals
the
squirrel
seized
a
crumb
and
scampered
up
a
tree
jeanne
looked
at
the
tree
why
said
she
it
a
tree
just
like
that
big
one
on
the
bank
behind
old
captain
house
i
wonder
off
came
jeanne
jacket
she
dropped
it
on
the
grass
seized
the
lowest
branch
and
in
three
minutes
was
perched
like
a
bluebird
well
toward
the
top
of
the
tree
about
that
time
her
cousins
missed
her
and
turned
back
unhappily
the
park
policeman
noticed
the
swaying
of
the
topmost
branches
of
that
desecrated
tree
and
hurried
to
investigate
clara
and
pearl
arrived
in
time
to
hear
the
policeman
shout
here
boy
come
down
from
there
it
against
the
park
rules
to
climb
trees
jeanne
climbed
meekly
down
much
to
the
astonishment
of
the
policeman
who
grinned
when
he
saw
the
expected
boy
well
said
he
you
ai
the
sort
of
bird
i
was
lookin
for
i
should
think
said
pearl
who
was
deeply
chagrined
you
be
at
any
rate
we
ashamed
you
i
shall
tell
mother
about
it
said
clara
virtuously
principal
occupation
it
seemed
to
jeanne
was
telling
mother
the
idea
climbing
trees
in
the
park
right
before
mother
company
too
i
do
wonder
that
harold
calls
you
the
cinder
pond
savage
chapter
xiv
at
four
jeanne
spent
a
very
dull
summer
part
of
the
time
her
cousins
were
away
visiting
their
grandmother
huntington
mother
jeanne
had
eyed
their
departing
forms
a
bit
wistfully
i
wish
thought
she
they
invited
the
sea
she
was
sure
would
prove
almost
as
nice
as
lake
superior
unless
of
course
one
happened
to
be
thirsty
unfortunately
the
grandmother
had
had
room
for
only
three
young
guests
possibly
she
had
been
told
that
jeanne
was
a
little
savage
and
feared
to
include
her
in
her
invitation
after
school
closed
she
had
only
her
grandfather
the
garden
books
and
her
music
lessons
she
her
music
lessons
from
a
cross
old
professor
it
was
bad
enough
to
hear
pearl
and
clara
practice
without
doing
it
herself
her
thoughts
when
she
practiced
were
always
gloomy
ones
once
downstairs
maggie
had
sung
a
song
beginning
i
am
always
saddest
when
i
sing
and
i
said
jeanne
in
the
big
lonely
whose
corners
were
always
dark
enough
to
conceal
most
any
lurking
horror
am
always
saddest
when
i
practice
i
rather
things
that
the
kind
of
fingers
mine
are
however
after
she
had
discovered
that
two
very
deep
bass
notes
rolled
together
and
two
others
higher
up
could
be
mingled
to
make
a
noise
like
waves
beating
against
the
old
dock
she
felt
more
respect
for
the
piano
perhaps
in
time
she
could
even
make
it
twitter
like
the
swallows
the
garden
had
proved
disappointing
jeanne
supposed
that
a
garden
meant
flowers
it
did
in
bancroft
but
this
was
a
city
garden
the
air
was
always
smoky
almost
always
dusty
the
garden
except
just
after
a
rain
never
looked
clean
there
was
a
hedge
but
it
collected
dust
and
papers
blown
from
the
street
the
best
thing
about
it
was
the
large
fountain
with
three
nymphs
in
the
center
pouring
water
from
three
big
shells
the
nymphs
were
about
jeanne
size
and
looked
as
if
they
had
been
working
for
quite
a
number
of
years
besides
the
fountain
there
were
four
vases
of
red
geraniums
two
very
neat
walks
and
some
dusty
grass
also
some
small
evergreen
trees
clipped
to
look
like
solid
balls
and
one
large
elm
her
grandfather
often
sat
under
the
elm
tree
on
an
iron
bench
fortunately
he
did
object
seriously
to
caterpillars
one
day
he
discovered
jeanne
flat
on
her
stomach
dipping
her
fingers
into
the
fountain
my
dear
child
said
he
what
you
doing
just
feeling
to
see
how
warm
it
is
said
jeanne
kicking
up
her
heels
in
order
to
reach
deeper
it
awfully
cold
is
it
if
there
were
so
many
windows
and
folks
around
i
think
i
like
to
go
in
swimming
swimming
can
you
swim
of
course
returned
jeanne
i
swam
in
the
cinder
pond
from
time
to
time
homesick
jeanne
continued
to
test
the
waters
of
the
fountain
in
august
to
her
delight
she
found
the
water
almost
lukewarm
to
be
sure
the
weather
was
all
but
sizzling
her
grandfather
accustomed
to
seeing
her
dabble
her
fingers
in
the
water
was
far
from
suspecting
the
shocking
deed
she
was
contemplating
then
the
deed
was
accomplished
for
thirteen
blissful
mornings
the
cinder
pond
savage
did
something
that
made
harold
seem
to
his
mother
like
a
little
white
angel
compared
with
that
dreadful
child
from
bancroft
of
course
it
pretty
dreadful
for
thirteen
days
jeanne
slipped
joyfully
from
her
bed
at
four
crept
down
the
stairs
out
of
the
door
and
along
the
walk
to
the
fountain
she
slipped
out
of
her
slid
over
the
edge
and
for
of
an
hour
fairly
revelled
in
the
fountain
for
thirteen
glorious
mornings
and
then
huntington
had
had
a
troublesome
tooth
she
rose
to
find
a
capsicum
plaster
to
apply
to
her
gum
to
read
the
label
it
was
necessary
to
carry
the
box
to
the
window
she
glanced
downward
and
dropped
the
box
something
white
and
wet
and
naked
was
climbing
out
of
the
fountain
had
some
horrid
dared
to
profane
the
huntington
fountain
the
boy
poised
on
the
curb
shook
his
dark
head
a
bunch
of
dark
hair
fell
about
his
wet
shoulders
jeanne
gasped
huntington
what
that
wretched
child
do
next
jeanne
was
late
to
breakfast
that
morning
she
had
fallen
asleep
after
her
bath
when
she
slipped
rather
guiltily
into
her
place
at
the
table
her
uncle
charles
who
ordinarily
paid
no
attention
to
her
raised
his
eyebrows
superciliously
and
fixed
his
gaze
upon
her
as
if
she
were
an
interesting
stranger
her
grandfather
too
regarded
her
oddly
so
did
her
aunt
agatha
i
sorry
i
so
late
apologized
jeanne
i
slept
too
long
you
are
a
deceitful
child
accused
huntington
frigidly
you
were
asleep
for
how
long
may
i
ask
have
you
been
bathing
in
the
fountain
about
two
weeks
said
jeanne
calmly
it
lovely
exclaimed
huntington
it
and
for
two
weeks
are
you
sure
that
no
one
has
seen
you
only
a
policeman
he
was
on
horseback
you
see
i
frightened
a
and
he
squawked
the
policeman
stopped
to
see
what
had
frightened
him
but
i
pretended
i
was
part
of
the
statue
in
the
middle
of
the
fountain
uncle
charles
suddenly
choked
over
his
coffee
her
grandfather
too
began
suddenly
to
cough
dignified
james
standing
unobserved
near
the
wall
actually
from
the
room
huntington
continued
to
frown
at
the
small
culprit
you
may
eat
your
breakfast
said
she
sternly
come
to
me
afterwards
in
my
room
there
was
to
be
no
more
bathing
in
the
fountain
even
in
a
bathing
suit
jeanne
learned
that
she
had
been
a
wicked
child
and
that
it
would
have
happened
if
her
father
had
been
a
common
fishman
i
am
thankful
concluded
aunt
agatha
that
your
cousins
are
out
of
town
would
of
doing
anything
so
unladylike
after
that
jeanne
liveliest
adventures
were
those
that
she
found
in
books
fortunately
she
loved
to
read
that
helped
a
great
deal
she
was
really
rather
glad
when
the
dull
vacation
was
over
and
oh
so
delighted
to
see
lizzie
and
susie
all
that
first
week
she
whispering
to
them
in
school
even
if
the
new
teacher
did
give
her
bad
marks
and
move
her
to
the
very
front
seat
i
go
home
with
you
if
i
said
jeanne
declining
one
of
susie
numerous
invitations
but
i
have
to
go
straight
home
from
school
always
you
went
into
lydia
coleman
house
yesterday
objected
jealous
susie
only
to
get
a
book
for
my
cousin
besides
that
right
on
my
way
home
maybe
if
lived
on
the
avenue
susie
sneered
lizzie
who
understood
huntington
snobbishness
only
too
well
she
be
allowed
to
go
with
you
hurry
up
and
move
said
jeanne
i
your
house
susie
i
know
it
a
house
i
liked
your
mother
when
she
came
to
the
school
exercises
and
i
sure
i
like
any
house
she
lived
in
but
you
see
i
do
so
many
bad
things
without
knowing
that
i
being
bad
that
it
never
would
do
for
me
to
be
bad
besides
i
promised
my
father
mind
aunt
agatha
so
of
course
i
have
to
i
love
to
go
home
with
of
you
next
to
her
grandfather
jeanne
pleasantest
companion
out
of
school
was
the
small
brown
maid
in
the
big
mirror
set
in
her
closet
door
there
were
mirrors
like
that
in
all
the
huntington
bedrooms
so
it
sometimes
looked
as
if
there
were
two
claras
and
two
pearls
and
two
aunt
agathas
which
made
it
worse
if
either
of
the
girls
were
snippish
or
if
aunt
agatha
happened
to
be
thinking
of
the
fountain
apparently
huntington
would
forget
that
jeanne
thought
but
to
jeanne
mind
the
girl
she
saw
in
her
own
mirror
had
a
face
even
if
it
was
rather
brown
she
liked
the
other
child
big
dark
eyes
now
serious
now
sparkling
under
very
neat
slender
eyebrows
with
some
new
entertaining
thought
the
mouth
was
just
a
bit
large
perhaps
with
red
lips
full
of
queer
little
wiggly
curves
that
came
and
went
according
to
her
mood
her
nose
rather
a
small
affair
at
best
did
it
turn
up
or
did
it
one
could
be
quite
sure
lizzie
turned
up
ikey
goldberg
turned
down
but
this
nose
seemed
to
do
both
for
that
reason
it
seemed
a
most
interesting
nose
even
if
there
were
no
freckles
on
it
when
lips
are
narrow
and
straight
when
noses
are
likewise
absolutely
straight
as
pearl
and
clara
were
they
may
be
perfect
or
even
beautiful
but
they
are
not
a
wiggly
mouth
as
jeanne
said
keeps
one
guessing
so
does
an
uncertain
nose
then
there
was
the
chin
not
a
chin
like
the
one
in
the
picture
of
bridget
first
husband
the
nor
a
chinless
chin
like
ethel
quite
a
good
deal
of
a
chin
i
should
say
was
jeanne
verdict
then
the
rest
of
the
a
little
smaller
perhaps
than
many
girls
of
the
same
age
but
very
nicely
made
arms
the
right
size
and
length
hands
not
too
big
shoulders
straight
and
not
too
high
like
bridget
nor
too
sloping
like
maggie
a
slight
waist
that
need
to
be
pinched
in
like
aunt
agatha
legs
that
looked
like
legs
not
like
piano
legs
as
hannah
schmidt
did
for
instance
when
hannah
wore
white
stockings
the
feet
were
small
the
hair
grew
prettily
about
the
bright
sociable
face
you
just
about
the
best
friend
i
have
declared
jeanne
kissing
the
i
glad
you
live
in
my
closet
i
be
awfully
lonesome
if
you
did
jeanne
however
was
not
a
vain
little
girl
nor
a
conceited
one
she
simply
did
think
of
the
as
the
girl
in
the
mirror
was
merely
another
girl
of
her
own
age
and
she
loved
her
quite
unselfishly
perhaps
jeanne
most
personal
thought
came
when
she
washed
her
face
i
so
glad
i
do
have
like
the
milkman
said
she
or
a
wart
on
my
nose
like
bridget
it
much
pleasanter
sure
to
wash
a
smooth
face
like
this
chapter
xv
allen
rossiter
in
november
there
came
a
day
when
nobody
in
the
huntington
house
spoke
above
a
whisper
there
was
a
trained
nurse
in
the
house
three
very
solemn
doctors
coming
and
going
and
an
air
of
everybody
for
something
james
told
maggie
and
maggie
told
jeanne
that
old
huntington
had
had
a
stroke
is
my
grandfather
going
to
die
asked
jeannette
when
maggie
had
patiently
explained
the
serious
nature
of
huntington
sudden
illness
i
do
know
returned
maggie
nobody
knows
not
even
the
doctors
for
a
great
many
dreary
days
her
grandfather
remained
just
the
same
until
jeanne
considered
those
three
words
the
most
hateful
ones
in
the
english
tongue
then
one
memorable
morning
later
it
seemed
she
heard
duncan
say
on
his
way
out
a
decided
change
for
the
better
mrs
huntington
jeanne
was
so
glad
that
she
danced
a
little
jig
with
her
friend
in
the
mirror
often
after
that
she
waylaid
the
pleasant
nurse
to
ask
about
the
invalid
but
miss
raymond
one
response
was
nicely
my
dear
nicely
for
weeks
and
weeks
jeanne
saw
nothing
of
her
grandfather
consequently
her
mathematics
became
very
bad
indeed
but
at
last
one
sunday
morning
the
nurse
summoned
her
to
her
room
your
grandfather
wants
to
see
you
said
miss
raymond
you
must
be
very
quiet
and
not
stay
too
long
just
five
minutes
five
minutes
were
enough
there
was
a
strange
wrinkled
old
man
who
looked
small
and
shriveled
in
that
big
white
bed
her
grandfather
eyes
had
been
keen
and
bright
the
eyes
of
this
stranger
were
dull
sunken
and
oh
so
tired
how
do
you
do
said
jeanne
primly
i
i
sorry
you
been
sick
better
now
i
better
now
quavered
a
strange
voice
how
is
the
arithmetic
very
bad
said
jeanne
miss
turner
says
i
plastered
a
room
with
two
bushels
of
oats
and
measured
a
barn
for
an
acre
of
carpet
instead
of
getting
the
right
number
of
apples
from
an
orchard
you
have
to
do
so
kinds
of
work
in
examples
that
it
hard
to
remember
whether
you
a
farmer
or
a
paperhanger
i
suppose
wet
things
run
out
of
a
bushel
basket
but
wet
measure
and
dry
measure
get
all
mixed
up
i
think
your
grandfather
is
asleep
said
the
nurse
gently
you
may
come
again
tomorrow
as
huntington
improved
jeanne
visits
grew
longer
after
a
time
he
was
able
to
help
her
again
with
her
lessons
but
all
that
winter
the
old
man
sat
in
his
own
room
in
february
the
nurse
departed
and
james
took
her
place
james
who
had
lived
with
the
family
for
many
years
was
fond
of
huntington
and
served
him
devotedly
as
before
jeannette
spent
much
time
with
her
grandfather
also
in
obedience
to
their
mother
wishes
the
young
huntingtons
entered
the
old
man
room
decorously
once
a
day
to
say
good
morning
neither
the
children
nor
huntington
appeared
to
enjoy
these
brief
daily
visits
jeanne
was
certainly
a
more
considerate
visitor
she
was
ever
ready
to
move
his
a
little
closer
to
peel
an
orange
for
him
to
find
him
a
book
or
to
sit
quietly
beside
him
while
he
dozed
one
day
in
march
he
told
her
where
to
find
some
keys
and
how
to
fit
one
of
them
to
a
small
safe
in
the
corner
of
his
room
bring
me
all
the
papers
in
the
first
to
the
left
said
he
it
time
i
was
doing
some
spring
housecleaning
i
love
to
help
said
jeanne
swiftly
obedient
he
sorted
the
papers
dividing
them
into
two
piles
put
these
back
and
bring
me
everything
in
the
next
hole
jeanne
did
that
this
operation
was
repeated
until
all
the
papers
many
quite
yellow
with
age
had
been
sorted
these
said
her
grandfather
pointing
to
the
documents
on
the
chair
beside
him
are
of
no
use
we
tear
them
into
small
pieces
and
wrap
them
in
this
newspaper
that
right
now
do
you
think
you
could
go
to
the
furnace
and
put
this
bundle
right
on
top
of
the
fire
without
dropping
a
single
scrap
do
you
know
exactly
where
the
furnace
is
yes
said
jeanne
when
i
first
came
i
asked
maggie
what
made
the
house
warm
she
said
the
furnace
did
i
wanted
to
see
what
a
furnace
so
she
showed
it
to
me
where
is
mrs
huntington
she
out
with
the
girls
at
the
dressmaker
i
think
and
bridget
asleep
in
her
room
this
is
maggie
afternoon
out
bridget
sleeps
when
maggie
is
here
to
tease
her
what
is
james
doing
i
guess
he
taking
a
nap
on
the
he
does
sometimes
very
well
the
coast
seems
to
be
clear
put
the
bundle
in
the
furnace
see
that
it
catches
on
fire
also
please
see
that
you
do
i
laughed
jeanne
and
i
never
yet
cooked
in
five
minutes
jeanne
was
back
james
is
snoring
said
she
he
does
that
only
when
aunt
agatha
is
far
away
listen
he
does
lovely
snores
did
the
trash
burn
every
scrap
replied
jeanne
i
opened
the
furnace
door
after
a
minute
or
two
to
see
the
fire
was
pretty
hot
and
they
burned
right
up
it
is
foolish
said
her
grandfather
to
keep
old
letters
and
old
vows
during
the
easter
vacation
the
huntingtons
entertained
a
visitor
an
attractive
lad
of
fifteen
whose
home
was
in
chicago
his
name
was
allen
rossiter
he
sort
of
a
cousin
explained
harold
his
grandfather
and
my
grandfather
were
brothers
jeanne
decided
that
allen
was
a
pleasant
sort
of
a
cousin
a
fair
lad
with
blue
eyes
allen
was
tall
for
his
age
and
very
manly
i
heard
a
lot
about
you
said
jeanne
the
day
allen
paid
his
first
visit
to
old
huntington
you
been
here
before
have
you
yes
you
see
my
father
a
railroad
man
so
naturally
i
have
to
practice
traveling
because
i
going
to
be
one
too
i
learned
how
to
order
a
meal
on
the
train
and
have
enough
left
to
tip
the
porter
you
accomplished
a
great
deal
smiled
huntington
more
than
that
said
allen
i
know
how
to
read
a
how
to
tell
which
trains
are
and
which
are
which
ones
are
fast
and
which
are
slow
here
a
i
have
ten
lovely
folders
in
my
pocket
tell
me
where
you
want
to
go
jeannette
and
i
show
you
just
how
to
do
it
to
bancroft
said
jeanne
it
up
on
lake
superior
here
a
map
now
where
is
it
about
there
said
jeanne
yes
that
it
and
here
the
right
you
go
direct
to
chicago
i
know
that
said
jeanne
but
you
want
a
fast
train
here
a
dandy
it
starts
at
that
at
night
you
know
you
are
in
chicago
at
noon
the
first
train
out
of
there
for
bancroft
leaves
at
eight
at
night
then
you
change
at
negaunee
easy
said
jeanne
you
just
walk
across
the
station
and
say
this
the
train
to
bancroft
daddy
told
me
always
to
but
what
do
i
do
in
chicago
that
the
hardest
part
you
go
from
this
station
to
one
here
are
the
names
do
you
see
there
i
marked
them
i
tell
you
what
i
do
you
telegraph
and
i
meet
you
and
put
you
aboard
the
right
train
when
do
you
start
just
three
years
and
three
months
from
now
right
after
school
closes
well
laughed
allen
you
certainly
do
intend
to
miss
that
train
but
i
meet
you
i
the
family
i
meet
my
grandmother
i
meet
my
aunts
and
all
my
mother
friends
i
meeting
somebody
with
a
suitcase
full
of
anyway
nobody
ever
brings
a
light
one
but
your
shoes
i
sure
would
weigh
as
much
as
my
grandmother
a
grandmother
may
i
keep
this
asked
jeanne
earnestly
you
may
returned
the
smiling
lad
but
it
be
pretty
stale
three
years
from
now
three
months
sighed
jeanne
but
having
this
to
look
at
will
make
bancroft
seem
so
said
huntington
you
going
to
be
a
railroad
man
yes
replied
allen
if
they
have
railroad
ladies
by
that
time
jeannette
i
give
you
a
job
i
sha
need
it
said
jeanne
i
going
to
be
married
to
whom
asked
allen
got
him
picked
out
the
iceman
i
think
oh
does
a
railroad
man
stay
away
from
home
a
great
deal
almost
all
the
time
my
mother
says
goody
that
what
i
have
a
railroad
man
i
wait
for
you
laughed
allen
you
the
funniest
little
kid
met
in
a
long
time
i
do
have
to
decide
until
i
twenty
said
jeanne
cautiously
i
find
a
more
husband
than
that
the
next
morning
the
postman
brought
a
letter
from
jeanne
father
as
usual
harold
who
had
rudely
snatched
the
mail
from
james
held
jeanne
letter
behind
him
with
one
hand
and
held
his
nose
with
the
other
what
the
matter
asked
allen
fish
returned
harold
pretending
to
be
very
her
father
a
fishman
you
know
you
can
smell
his
letters
coming
while
they
still
on
the
train
allen
glanced
at
jeannette
she
was
red
with
embarrassment
and
very
close
to
tears
you
young
cub
said
he
i
heard
all
about
jeanne
father
from
my
grandmother
i
do
know
what
he
doing
now
but
the
duvals
were
a
splendid
old
french
family
even
if
they
poor
back
they
were
huguenots
perhaps
you
had
those
in
school
anyway
they
were
fine
people
and
jeannette
father
was
well
educated
and
a
gentleman
it
is
a
bit
worse
to
sell
fish
than
it
is
to
sit
all
day
in
a
bank
i
sell
fish
myself
particularly
if
i
could
do
the
catching
you
better
not
let
mother
hear
you
said
clara
primly
allowed
to
say
anything
about
jeannette
people
i
sure
we
do
to
said
pearl
virtuously
well
returned
allen
my
grandmother
says
that
the
duvals
began
being
an
old
family
long
before
the
huntingtons
did
that
all
i
know
about
it
but
my
grandmother
never
tells
fibs
and
she
knew
the
duvals
the
rest
of
us
do
hurry
up
and
read
your
letter
jeannette
we
all
going
to
the
park
to
feed
the
animals
which
one
shall
we
feed
to
jeanne
laughed
allen
had
hoped
that
she
would
it
was
a
nice
laugh
quite
different
from
harold
teasing
one
at
the
park
jeanne
had
another
embarrassing
moment
when
clara
maliciously
pointed
out
the
tree
that
jeanne
had
climbed
but
allen
had
pretended
not
to
hear
harold
who
had
carried
an
umbrella
because
pearl
had
insisted
slashed
the
shrubbery
with
it
and
used
it
to
prod
the
animals
he
annoyed
the
rabbits
tormented
the
parrots
the
sea
lion
and
finally
the
monkeys
quit
it
said
allen
you
a
sissy
retorted
harold
unpleasantly
no
i
not
do
torment
animals
harold
does
said
pearl
it
hard
enough
to
live
in
a
cage
said
jeanne
without
being
poked
there
monkey
has
torn
your
umbrella
little
brute
snarled
harold
aiming
a
deadly
thrust
at
the
small
offender
i
teach
you
allen
wrenched
the
umbrella
from
his
angry
cousin
let
carry
it
said
he
there
a
guard
coming
and
you
might
get
into
trouble
allen
visit
lasted
for
only
five
days
jeanne
was
sorry
that
he
could
stay
for
five
years
respected
her
father
if
that
had
been
his
admirable
trait
jeanne
would
have
liked
him
remember
said
allen
at
parting
that
i
am
to
act
as
your
guide
three
years
and
three
months
from
now
i
wo
forget
promised
jeanne
who
had
gone
to
the
station
with
her
cousins
to
see
the
visitor
off
i
have
your
address
and
i
learned
in
school
how
to
write
a
long
long
telegram
in
than
ten
words
you
surely
get
it
some
nice
warm
day
in
june
three
and
a
quarter
years
from
now
how
jeannette
kept
this
promise
you
will
discover
later
chapter
xvi
an
old
album
there
a
great
big
piece
of
news
in
my
letter
from
daddy
confided
jeanne
who
had
been
summoned
to
sit
with
her
grandfather
he
had
been
alone
for
longer
than
he
liked
since
his
illness
indeed
he
seemed
to
like
someone
with
him
and
jeanne
was
usually
the
only
person
available
what
kind
of
news
he
asked
good
news
i
guess
my
stepgrandmother
is
gone
forever
and
i
sort
of
glad
what
is
she
dead
oh
no
i
would
be
glad
of
you
see
she
had
a
bad
son
named
john
who
ran
away
from
home
ever
so
long
ago
he
was
older
than
mollie
his
mother
and
everybody
thought
he
was
dead
it
was
so
long
since
they
heard
anything
from
him
but
he
was
he
was
they
never
guessed
he
do
that
he
had
any
children
but
he
had
a
real
good
wife
a
very
one
after
she
died
he
did
have
anybody
so
he
thought
of
his
poor
old
mother
about
time
i
should
think
yes
it
well
he
went
to
bancroft
to
hunt
for
his
mother
and
he
taken
her
to
louis
to
live
he
gave
mollie
some
money
for
clothes
and
quilts
and
things
but
it
wo
do
a
mite
of
good
why
not
mollie
would
be
too
lazy
to
spend
it
or
to
take
care
of
the
things
if
she
had
them
her
mother
spent
a
great
deal
for
medicine
for
her
rheumatism
but
mollie
just
bought
things
to
eat
if
she
bought
she
loved
to
sit
outside
the
door
all
sort
of
soft
and
lazy
with
the
wind
blowing
her
pale
red
hair
about
her
soft
white
face
and
a
baby
in
her
lap
i
can
just
see
her
this
very
minute
i
ca
see
said
huntington
testily
why
your
father
ever
married
that
woman
he
said
jeanne
she
married
barney
turcott
said
so
daddy
had
nursed
my
mother
through
a
terrible
sickness
i
it
was
typhoid
he
said
and
in
spite
of
everything
he
could
do
she
died
afterwards
he
was
almost
crazy
about
it
about
losing
her
he
think
of
anything
else
and
while
he
was
like
that
had
a
fever
and
was
sick
for
a
long
long
time
before
he
was
really
well
he
was
married
to
mollie
barney
said
the
shannons
took
ad
adventures
no
that
is
it
advantage
yes
that
it
advantage
of
him
they
thought
because
his
clothes
were
good
that
he
had
money
but
they
took
very
good
care
of
me
at
first
barney
said
but
mollie
kept
getting
lazier
and
lazier
and
father
kept
getting
stronger
and
healthier
but
the
better
he
got
the
more
discouraged
he
was
about
having
mollie
and
all
those
children
and
not
enough
money
you
see
he
was
well
until
after
they
were
living
on
the
dock
barney
said
the
fresh
air
was
all
that
saved
him
and
that
now
he
a
different
man
mollie
cooking
is
enough
to
discourage
anybody
but
barney
says
gum
he
stuck
by
her
like
a
man
my
child
you
must
quote
barney
quite
so
literally
surely
he
did
say
all
that
to
no
barney
never
talks
to
anybody
but
men
he
so
bashful
he
was
telling
another
man
why
he
liked
my
father
they
were
reeling
a
net
where
were
you
behind
them
peeling
potatoes
i
did
know
that
it
polite
to
listen
you
poor
little
savage
i
do
mind
assured
jeanne
when
call
me
a
savage
but
when
harold
does
i
like
one
jeanne
had
been
warned
never
to
mention
her
mother
in
her
presence
and
she
had
meant
not
to
but
by
this
time
you
have
surely
guessed
that
jeanne
with
no
one
else
to
whom
she
could
talk
freely
was
apt
to
unbottle
herself
as
it
were
whenever
she
found
her
grandfather
in
a
listening
mood
she
was
naturally
a
good
deal
of
a
chatterbox
but
like
many
another
little
chatterbox
preferred
a
sympathetic
listener
sometimes
as
just
now
she
spoke
of
her
mother
without
remembering
that
she
was
a
forbidden
subject
but
now
some
of
the
questions
that
she
had
been
longing
to
ask
thronged
to
her
lips
her
grandfather
was
so
very
gentle
with
her
oh
if
she
only
dared
what
you
thinking
about
asked
huntington
after
a
long
silence
that
is
a
very
valuable
picture
and
you
are
looking
a
hole
right
through
it
i
was
wondering
said
jeanne
touching
her
grandfather
hand
timidly
if
you
would
be
willing
to
tell
me
something
about
my
mother
nobody
ever
has
what
she
was
like
when
she
was
little
i
mean
when
was
just
thirteen
and
a
half
did
she
ever
look
even
a
tiny
little
scrap
like
yes
replied
her
grandfather
quite
calmly
you
like
her
not
so
much
in
looks
as
in
other
ways
you
are
darker
and
your
bones
are
smaller
i
think
but
you
move
and
speak
like
her
sometimes
and
you
too
are
bright
and
quick
and
some
part
of
your
face
like
hers
but
i
do
know
whether
it
your
brow
or
your
chin
now
you
may
clean
my
glasses
for
me
and
hunt
up
my
book
i
think
james
must
have
moved
it
it
time
you
were
changing
your
dress
for
dinner
after
that
jeanne
learned
a
number
of
things
about
her
mother
that
she
had
loved
flowers
when
she
was
just
a
tiny
baby
that
pink
was
her
favorite
color
that
she
had
liked
cats
and
peppermint
and
people
that
she
was
very
impulsive
often
doing
the
deed
first
the
thinking
afterwards
and
yes
her
impulses
had
almost
always
been
kind
once
jeanne
grandfather
so
far
forgot
his
grievance
against
his
only
daughter
as
to
chuckle
softly
at
the
remembrance
of
the
childish
prank
she
had
felt
so
sorry
for
a
hungry
tramp
that
the
cook
had
turned
away
that
the
moment
cook
back
was
turned
bessie
had
at
the
risk
of
being
severely
burned
pulled
a
huge
crock
of
baked
beans
from
the
oven
wrapped
a
thick
towel
about
it
slipped
outside
and
thrust
it
upon
the
tramp
the
tramp
been
burned
and
they
had
had
to
send
for
a
policeman
in
order
to
get
his
bad
language
off
the
premises
jeanne
had
heard
this
story
the
night
that
she
had
had
her
dinner
with
her
grandfather
she
was
supposed
to
be
eating
in
the
with
her
cousins
but
when
maggie
had
cleared
huntington
little
table
that
evening
preparatory
to
bringing
in
his
tray
jeanne
had
said
bring
enough
for
me
too
maggie
i
going
to
stay
right
here
you
let
me
wo
you
i
you
was
the
response
i
do
know
why
i
did
think
of
doing
it
long
ago
you
see
whenever
the
huntingtons
entertained
at
dinner
as
they
frequently
did
the
children
were
banished
to
the
between
pearl
snippishness
clara
snubbing
and
harold
teasing
these
were
usually
unhappy
occasions
for
jeanne
and
generally
the
three
young
huntingtons
quarreled
with
one
another
besides
with
no
elders
to
restrain
him
harold
was
decidedly
rude
and
grabby
i
think
said
jeanne
after
one
particularly
uproarious
meal
during
which
harold
had
plastered
pearl
face
with
mashed
potato
and
poured
water
down
jeanne
back
that
i
learned
more
good
manners
from
harold
than
from
anybody
else
his
are
so
very
bad
that
it
makes
me
want
nice
ones
after
the
meal
with
her
grandfather
was
finished
he
showed
her
where
to
find
an
old
photograph
album
hidden
behind
the
books
in
his
bookcase
there
said
he
opening
it
at
a
page
containing
four
small
pictures
this
is
your
mother
when
she
was
six
months
old
she
was
three
or
four
years
old
in
this
next
one
and
here
is
one
at
the
age
of
twelve
she
was
seventeen
when
this
last
one
was
taken
is
this
all
there
are
asked
jeanne
who
had
studied
the
four
little
pictures
earnestly
of
her
i
mean
yes
only
those
four
young
people
did
have
cameras
in
those
days
you
know
keep
the
place
for
me
said
jeanne
returning
the
book
to
her
grandfather
knee
i
be
back
in
just
a
second
she
returned
very
quickly
with
the
miniature
of
elizabeth
huntington
duval
that
she
had
been
longing
to
show
to
her
grandfather
my
father
had
a
friend
who
was
an
artist
said
jeanne
breathlessly
he
painted
that
soon
after
they
were
married
for
a
father
said
was
it
a
nice
one
why
i
delighted
to
see
this
my
dear
said
her
grandfather
gazing
eagerly
at
the
lovely
face
it
by
far
the
best
picture
of
bessie
ever
seen
it
is
very
like
her
and
her
face
is
full
of
happiness
very
glad
of
that
i
had
no
idea
of
its
existence
i
am
very
glad
indeed
that
you
thought
of
showing
it
to
me
so
am
i
said
jeanne
you
always
so
good
to
me
that
i
glad
i
could
give
a
pleasure
for
once
you
must
take
very
good
care
of
this
said
huntington
it
a
very
fine
miniature
i
always
do
returned
jeanne
i
thought
it
was
ever
so
good
of
my
father
to
give
it
to
me
the
only
one
he
had
it
was
indeed
said
huntington
appreciatively
now
put
it
away
my
dear
and
keep
it
safe
in
the
to
which
the
guests
had
just
been
ushered
by
james
in
his
very
grandest
manner
a
lady
had
leaned
forward
to
say
gushingly
to
her
hostess
what
a
child
your
youngest
daughter
is
huntington
i
saw
her
at
dancing
school
last
week
and
simply
fell
in
love
with
her
so
graceful
and
a
charming
face
she
came
in
with
your
son
clara
a
lovely
child
returned
huntington
complacently
i
think
said
the
guest
my
little
son
said
that
her
name
was
jeannette
that
said
huntington
coldly
people
were
always
singing
that
wretched
child
praises
was
merely
my
husband
niece
who
has
been
placed
in
our
care
for
a
short
time
that
time
i
am
happy
to
say
is
almost
half
over
she
is
a
great
trial
fortunately
children
have
been
too
well
brought
up
to
be
influenced
by
her
incomprehensible
behavior
her
hoidenish
manners
at
this
moment
there
came
the
sound
of
a
sudden
crash
followed
by
shrieks
faintly
audible
in
the
although
huntington
guessed
that
harold
had
at
last
succeeded
in
upsetting
the
table
and
that
either
pearl
or
clara
had
been
burned
with
the
resultant
flood
of
soup
she
turned
without
blinking
an
eyelash
to
the
guest
of
honor
on
her
right
to
speak
politely
of
the
weather
it
was
jeanne
who
rushed
to
the
to
find
the
table
overturned
and
all
three
of
her
cousins
gazing
with
consternation
at
a
wide
scalded
area
on
clara
white
wrist
it
was
jeanne
too
who
remembered
that
lard
and
cornstarch
would
stop
the
pain
also
it
was
jeanne
whom
huntington
afterwards
blamed
for
the
accident
her
bad
example
her
wicked
influence
was
simply
ruining
harold
disposition
sure
said
maggie
telling
bridget
about
it
later
that
lad
was
with
a
ruined
disposition
as
for
miss
jeannette
there
more
of
a
mother
kindness
in
one
touch
of
that
little
tyke
hand
than
there
is
in
whole
body
and
think
of
her
knowing
enough
to
use
lard
and
cornstarch
the
doctor
said
she
did
exactly
the
right
thing
chapter
xvii
a
lonely
summer
jeanne
had
liked
her
first
teacher
miss
wardell
very
much
indeed
and
pretty
miss
wardell
had
been
very
fond
of
jeannette
she
knew
that
the
child
was
shy
and
the
considerate
young
woman
managed
frequently
to
shield
her
from
embarrassment
and
to
help
her
over
the
rough
places
miss
turner
was
different
she
said
that
jeannette
made
her
nervous
it
is
possible
that
the
other
pupils
helped
but
it
was
jeanne
whom
she
blamed
for
her
shattered
nerves
it
is
certain
that
miss
turner
made
jeanne
nervous
no
matter
how
well
she
knew
her
lesson
she
recite
it
to
miss
turner
a
chatterbox
with
the
right
sort
of
listener
jeanne
was
stricken
dumb
the
moment
miss
turner
attention
was
focused
upon
her
what
a
bad
card
said
huntington
at
the
end
of
may
it
is
even
worse
than
it
was
last
month
pearl
and
clara
had
excellent
cards
and
harold
had
higher
marks
in
two
of
his
studies
than
you
have
you
are
a
very
ungrateful
child
you
do
appreciate
the
advantages
we
are
giving
you
when
school
is
out
i
shall
engage
miss
turner
to
tutor
you
through
the
summer
horrors
thought
jeanne
miss
turner
tutored
ethel
bailey
all
last
summer
continued
huntington
bailey
says
that
ethel
now
receives
excellent
marks
from
miss
said
jeanne
shrewdly
ethel
does
know
a
thing
about
her
lessons
she
the
stupidest
girl
in
our
grade
i
mine
but
it
hard
to
recite
if
i
have
a
tutor
could
i
have
miss
wardell
i
her
and
she
be
glad
of
the
extra
money
because
she
takes
care
of
her
mother
oh
let
me
have
miss
wardell
no
returned
huntington
firmly
miss
turner
will
know
best
what
is
needed
for
your
grade
you
are
learning
only
forty
in
history
well
sighed
jeanne
i
not
surprised
i
said
that
benedict
arnold
wrote
banner
and
that
lafayette
painted
gilbert
stuart
portrait
of
washington
i
better
but
oh
dear
when
miss
turner
looks
me
in
the
eye
and
asks
a
question
my
poor
frightened
tongue
always
says
the
wrong
thing
she
freeze
a
said
harold
for
once
agreeing
with
his
cousin
i
had
her
last
year
do
look
at
her
eyes
look
at
her
when
you
recite
i
to
look
at
her
eyes
sighed
jeanne
miserably
one
is
yellow
the
other
is
black
i
to
look
at
them
but
i
always
have
to
i
know
agreed
harold
i
had
ten
months
of
those
eyes
myself
i
hope
you
never
meet
a
snake
you
be
so
fascinated
that
you
run
miss
turner
eyes
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
said
huntington
bailey
said
she
made
an
excellent
tutor
so
i
shall
certainly
engage
her
perhaps
suggested
harold
consolingly
when
his
mother
had
left
the
room
she
wo
be
able
to
come
she
want
a
vacation
oh
i
so
so
do
i
said
harold
making
a
face
you
see
my
marks
in
latin
are
about
as
bad
as
they
make
it
occur
to
mother
to
let
miss
turner
use
up
her
spare
time
on
wow
anyhow
said
jeanne
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
trying
to
help
all
too
soon
it
was
june
school
was
out
and
jeanne
had
passed
in
a
single
study
even
her
deportment
had
received
a
very
low
mark
miss
turner
contrary
to
jeanne
fervent
hope
had
gladly
accepted
the
position
huntington
had
offered
her
huntington
broke
the
discouraging
news
at
the
breakfast
table
your
lessons
will
begin
at
nine
next
monday
jeannette
said
she
firmly
believing
that
she
was
doing
the
right
thing
by
a
strangely
backward
student
with
only
one
pupil
miss
turner
will
be
able
to
give
all
her
attention
to
you
again
harold
agreed
with
his
cousin
i
sorry
for
you
said
he
all
of
miss
turner
attention
is
more
than
any
one
human
pupil
could
stand
mother
suggested
clara
not
without
malice
why
do
you
let
miss
turner
help
harold
with
lessons
ouch
you
beast
stop
pinching
me
why
that
approved
huntington
is
a
good
idea
i
glad
you
mentioned
it
still
you
are
going
to
your
grandmother
so
soon
i
fear
harold
latin
will
have
to
be
postponed
so
great
was
harold
relief
that
he
collapsed
in
his
chair
the
summer
was
to
prove
a
dreary
one
besides
a
daily
dose
of
miss
turner
jeanne
was
worried
because
for
six
weeks
there
had
been
no
letter
from
her
father
previously
he
had
written
at
least
twice
a
month
and
from
time
to
time
had
sent
her
money
that
she
might
have
a
little
that
was
all
her
own
indeed
duval
who
had
no
lack
of
pride
had
every
intention
of
repaying
the
huntingtons
as
soon
as
he
could
for
whatever
they
had
expended
for
his
daughter
but
that
would
take
time
of
course
at
any
rate
jeanne
was
well
provided
with
pocket
money
to
be
sure
pearl
who
loved
to
order
expensive
concoctions
with
queer
names
at
fountains
usually
borrowed
the
money
sometimes
forgetting
to
return
it
also
thus
adding
insult
to
injury
pearl
always
invited
her
own
friends
to
partake
of
these
delicacies
without
inviting
jeanne
even
though
that
wistful
small
person
were
at
the
very
door
of
the
parlor
pearl
several
years
older
than
her
cousin
and
much
taller
did
want
tagging
along
but
now
for
six
weeks
there
had
been
no
letter
from
her
father
and
no
money
she
did
care
about
the
money
when
you
are
going
in
three
years
eleven
months
and
fourteen
days
you
are
so
afraid
that
you
wo
have
enough
money
for
your
ticket
when
the
time
comes
that
you
jeanne
had
saved
her
money
whenever
she
could
and
with
the
thrift
that
she
had
perhaps
inherited
from
some
remote
french
ancestor
had
hidden
it
in
the
fat
pincushion
of
the
that
huntington
had
given
her
for
christmas
she
had
hidden
it
so
neatly
too
that
no
one
would
ever
suspect
that
dollar
bills
had
gradually
replaced
the
sawdust
only
her
grandfather
knew
about
the
money
and
he
had
promised
not
to
tell
but
after
jeanne
had
intrusted
him
with
the
secret
and
when
james
was
shaving
the
old
gentleman
huntington
had
suddenly
chuckled
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
am
thinking
about
my
youngest
explained
his
master
she
is
the
wisest
little
monkey
i
ever
knew
she
has
enough
common
sense
for
a
whole
family
she
has
that
agreed
james
huntington
sir
would
dast
try
to
teach
cook
how
to
make
a
new
pie
cook
that
set
in
her
own
conceit
much
less
do
any
cooking
herself
but
that
there
little
thing
comes
in
last
month
with
a
new
dessert
that
she
learned
in
her
domestic
science
and
if
cook
did
sit
right
down
like
a
lamb
and
let
her
make
it
what
more
bridget
asked
for
the
rule
and
has
made
it
herself
every
sunday
since
cook
says
many
a
married
lady
is
less
handy
than
that
small
girl
she
got
brains
that
do
james
i
like
your
enthusiasm
but
not
when
you
gesticulate
with
that
razor
i
ca
spare
any
of
my
features
but
i
agree
with
you
about
the
child
she
is
thoughtful
beyond
her
years
the
postman
came
and
came
and
came
and
still
there
was
no
letter
old
captain
to
be
sure
had
written
oftener
than
usual
and
when
one
came
to
think
about
it
had
said
a
great
deal
less
she
knew
from
him
that
spring
had
come
to
the
cinder
pond
that
the
swallows
had
returned
that
the
clover
had
blossomed
that
the
tree
that
had
somehow
planted
itself
on
the
dock
promised
an
unusual
crop
of
berries
that
the
herring
were
unusually
large
and
abundant
but
whitefish
rather
scarce
also
the
lake
was
as
blue
as
ever
she
had
asked
about
that
and
barney
had
a
boil
on
his
neck
but
not
a
word
about
her
father
or
mollie
or
the
children
usually
there
had
been
some
new
piece
of
inquisitiveness
on
sammy
part
for
the
captain
to
write
about
for
sammy
was
certainly
an
inquisitive
youngster
if
there
ever
was
one
but
even
news
of
sammy
seemed
strangely
lacking
and
he
had
forgotten
twice
to
answer
jeanne
question
about
clothes
if
the
little
dress
that
jeanne
had
sent
for
christmas
was
still
wearable
or
had
she
outgrown
it
then
came
very
warm
weather
and
still
no
real
news
of
her
relatives
and
no
letter
from
her
father
once
he
and
barney
had
taken
rather
a
long
cruise
to
the
north
shore
perhaps
he
had
gone
again
with
dan
mcgraw
for
instance
who
was
always
cruising
about
for
fish
for
berries
or
for
wreckage
dan
had
often
invited
her
father
to
go
still
it
did
seem
as
if
he
would
have
mentioned
that
he
was
going
unless
indeed
he
had
gone
on
very
short
notice
or
perhaps
and
that
proved
a
most
distressing
thought
perhaps
she
had
been
gone
so
long
that
he
was
beginning
to
forget
her
perhaps
michael
to
whom
he
had
been
giving
nightly
lessons
had
taken
her
place
in
her
father
affections
indeed
harold
had
once
assured
her
that
fathers
liked
their
sons
better
than
their
daughters
perhaps
it
was
so
for
uncle
charles
who
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
pearl
and
clara
sometimes
talked
to
harold
as
before
the
young
huntingtons
had
gone
to
their
seashore
grandmother
jeannette
of
course
had
to
remain
within
reach
of
miss
turner
who
now
gave
her
better
marks
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
her
recitations
were
no
more
brilliant
and
even
less
comfortable
than
they
had
been
in
school
her
grandfather
who
seldom
interfered
in
any
way
with
plans
had
objected
to
miss
turner
she
may
be
an
excellent
teacher
for
ordinary
children
said
he
but
she
is
jeannette
kind
and
she
is
pleasant
she
is
not
unpleasant
to
returned
unmoved
aunt
agatha
whose
opinions
were
exceedingly
difficult
to
change
at
any
rate
it
is
too
late
to
discuss
the
matter
i
have
engaged
her
for
the
summer
at
a
definite
salary
next
summer
if
it
seems
best
we
can
make
some
different
arrangement
then
i
suppose
we
have
to
stand
it
sighed
huntington
but
it
seems
decidedly
unfortunate
that
when
out
of
a
hundred
have
measure
of
attractiveness
you
should
have
chosen
the
hundredth
perhaps
huntington
might
have
made
some
further
effort
toward
dislodging
miss
turner
but
shortly
after
the
foregoing
conversation
he
was
again
taken
for
more
than
a
week
he
had
been
kept
in
bed
and
james
had
said
something
to
the
cook
about
a
slight
stroke
but
to
jeanne
great
relief
this
illness
was
of
shorter
duration
than
the
preceding
one
he
was
up
again
and
spending
his
waking
hours
in
a
wheeled
chair
under
the
big
elm
in
the
garden
jeanne
however
could
see
that
he
was
not
so
well
his
eyes
had
lost
some
of
their
keenness
and
often
the
word
that
he
wanted
would
not
come
he
seemed
quite
a
good
many
years
older
and
not
nearly
so
vigorous
as
he
had
been
before
this
new
illness
jeanne
hovered
over
him
anxiously
sometimes
huntington
told
visitors
that
she
feared
that
her
faculties
were
becoming
sadly
impaired
he
seems
to
dislike
me
she
added
plaintively
when
she
mentioned
impaired
faculties
to
her
husband
james
overheard
this
indeed
james
was
overhearing
things
not
meant
for
his
ears
because
he
was
so
much
a
part
of
the
furniture
that
no
one
ever
remembered
that
he
was
in
the
room
or
gave
him
credit
for
being
human
james
told
bridget
about
it
the
old
gentleman
said
he
nor
anybody
else
does
need
impaired
faculties
to
dislike
lady
if
she
got
any
real
feelings
inside
her
they
cased
up
in
asbestos
like
the
pipes
to
the
furnace
they
never
comes
out
she
a
human
icicle
she
is
i
declare
if
she
get
real
mad
just
once
and
sling
the
soup
tureen
at
me
i
take
the
scalding
gladly
and
say
you
kindly
is
a
pleasure
to
see
you
thawing
just
for
once
james
you
have
noticed
was
much
more
human
in
the
kitchen
than
he
was
in
the
huntington
who
had
lived
under
the
same
roof
with
him
for
many
years
would
certainly
have
been
surprised
if
she
had
heard
him
for
in
her
presence
james
was
like
a
talking
doll
in
that
he
had
just
two
set
speeches
they
were
yes
and
no
she
padded
with
her
own
conceit
said
bridget
and
there
a
crust
outside
that
she
shows
no
affection
for
her
own
children
let
alone
that
motherless
lamb
if
she
ever
swallowed
her
pride
said
maggie
choke
her
then
i
hope
she
does
it
said
james
going
meekly
to
the
front
of
the
house
to
say
yes
and
no
to
his
frigid
mistress
for
if
james
were
more
talkative
in
the
kitchen
than
he
was
in
the
he
was
also
much
braver
chapter
xviii
a
thunderbolt
then
out
of
what
was
seemingly
a
clear
sky
came
a
thunderbolt
jeanne
aunt
agatha
at
least
had
noticed
no
gathering
clouds
and
for
that
reason
perhaps
was
the
harder
hit
something
happened
something
that
no
one
had
ever
dreamed
happen
in
so
a
house
as
huntington
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
impaired
faculties
of
old
huntington
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
possibly
the
impaired
faculties
combined
with
his
dislike
for
his
had
even
more
to
do
with
it
anyway
the
astounding
thing
for
which
huntington
was
never
afterwards
able
to
forgive
that
wretched
child
from
bancroft
happened
but
as
you
shall
see
it
was
exactly
fault
she
merely
obeyed
her
grandfather
it
was
not
until
the
deed
was
done
that
she
began
to
realize
its
unfairness
to
huntington
to
whom
jeanne
was
not
ungrateful
this
is
how
it
happened
jeanne
who
had
never
really
in
her
letters
to
her
father
in
her
conversations
with
her
grandfather
or
in
fact
to
anybody
jeanne
who
had
borne
every
trial
bravely
and
even
cheerfully
had
for
three
days
burst
into
tears
every
afternoon
at
precisely
four
you
see
this
was
the
time
when
the
postman
made
his
final
visit
for
the
day
as
the
lonely
little
girl
usually
spent
her
afternoons
in
the
dismal
garden
with
her
grandfather
he
had
witnessed
all
three
of
these
surprising
outbursts
she
had
said
a
word
she
had
merely
turned
from
the
letters
that
james
had
laid
on
the
table
and
sobbed
and
sobbed
and
sobbed
for
two
days
her
grandfather
had
not
seemed
to
notice
nowadays
he
notice
a
great
deal
on
the
first
occasion
of
her
weeping
he
had
even
fallen
into
a
doze
while
jeanne
her
head
on
the
littered
table
had
cried
all
the
tears
that
had
come
during
the
preceding
weeks
the
third
afternoon
her
grandfather
appeared
brighter
than
he
had
for
days
he
noticed
while
she
watched
for
the
postman
that
the
face
seemed
white
and
strained
that
there
were
dark
rings
about
her
eyes
again
there
was
no
letter
from
her
father
again
she
broke
down
and
sobbed
tell
me
about
it
said
he
with
a
trembling
hand
on
jeanne
heaving
shoulder
as
soon
as
jeanne
was
able
to
speak
at
all
she
poured
it
all
out
in
breathless
sentences
mixed
with
sobs
she
was
lonely
she
wanted
a
letter
from
her
father
she
wanted
her
father
himself
she
wanted
the
children
she
wanted
the
lake
she
wanted
to
go
home
she
had
wanted
to
go
home
every
minute
since
well
every
minute
since
the
moment
of
her
arrival
she
hated
miss
turner
she
hated
to
practice
scales
she
hated
the
hot
weather
she
was
homesick
she
wanted
mollie
to
at
her
mollie
was
always
good
to
her
and
oh
she
wanted
to
cuddle
patsy
he
he
wailed
jeanne
he
wo
be
a
baby
if
i
wait
three
three
years
or
wu
one
muh
month
less
than
three
years
i
i
wu
wu
want
to
go
home
why
bless
my
soul
said
her
surprised
grandfather
with
a
sudden
brightening
of
his
faded
eyes
there
no
good
reason
my
dear
why
you
should
go
home
for
a
visit
i
did
realize
i
did
guess
aunt
agatha
never
would
let
me
said
jeanne
hopelessly
i
asked
her
twice
since
school
was
out
it
so
hot
and
i
so
worried
about
daddy
i
thought
if
i
could
go
for
just
a
little
while
but
she
says
it
costs
too
much
money
that
i
must
even
of
such
a
thing
oh
she
did
did
she
jeanne
was
startled
then
by
the
look
that
came
into
her
sunken
eyes
it
was
a
strange
look
a
malevolent
look
a
look
full
of
malice
except
for
the
first
few
weeks
of
her
residence
with
her
grandfather
his
eyes
had
always
seemed
now
they
glittered
and
his
entire
face
settled
into
strange
new
lines
it
had
become
cruel
call
james
he
said
jeanne
jumped
with
surprise
at
the
sharpness
of
his
voice
faithful
james
who
was
snoring
on
the
huntington
being
out
for
the
afternoon
and
the
seat
being
wide
and
comfortable
hurried
to
his
master
james
said
huntington
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
not
a
word
of
this
to
anybody
do
you
promise
yes
sir
agreed
james
accustomed
to
blind
obedience
you
are
to
find
out
what
time
the
through
train
leaves
for
chicago
tonight
train
i
mean
be
ready
to
go
to
the
station
at
that
time
you
are
to
buy
a
ticket
from
here
to
bancroft
michigan
michigan
for
my
granddaughter
reserve
the
necessary
berths
she
will
have
two
nights
on
the
sleeper
you
will
find
money
in
the
drawer
of
my
dresser
if
it
is
enough
you
will
lend
me
some
she
will
need
something
extra
for
meals
and
so
forth
and
remember
not
a
word
to
anybody
if
necessary
go
outside
to
telephone
about
the
train
very
well
sir
said
james
i
understand
sir
and
by
jinks
you
good
now
jeannette
as
soon
as
we
know
what
time
that
train
goes
i
know
said
jeanne
i
have
that
the
one
that
allen
rossiter
gave
me
with
the
trains
marked
right
through
to
bancroft
but
james
had
better
make
sure
that
the
time
has
been
changed
and
please
could
he
send
a
telegram
to
allen
in
chicago
to
meet
me
i
have
his
address
of
course
returned
huntington
i
had
forgotten
that
allen
will
be
of
great
assistance
now
go
very
quietly
to
your
room
you
are
not
to
say
to
anybody
no
one
but
james
is
to
know
that
you
are
going
put
on
something
fit
to
travel
in
and
pack
as
many
useful
clothes
as
your
suitcase
will
hold
things
that
you
can
wear
in
bancroft
have
your
hat
and
gloves
where
you
can
find
them
quickly
and
take
your
money
with
you
james
will
take
care
of
everything
else
now
when
huntington
said
now
people
usually
went
jeanne
to
throw
her
arms
about
her
grandfather
neck
and
say
a
thousand
but
plainly
this
was
not
the
time
she
flew
to
her
room
fortunately
the
house
was
practically
deserted
for
jeanne
was
too
excited
to
remember
to
be
quiet
and
charles
huntington
however
had
left
at
two
for
a
long
motoring
trip
to
the
country
and
would
not
be
home
until
midnight
it
was
afternoon
out
and
maggie
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
all
the
things
i
want
said
she
opening
her
closet
door
i
hang
on
side
i
sha
need
any
party
clothes
for
the
cinder
pond
nor
any
white
shoes
of
course
the
suitcase
would
hold
everything
no
suitcase
ever
does
jeanne
selection
was
really
quite
wonderful
she
would
have
liked
to
buy
presents
for
all
the
children
but
there
was
no
time
for
that
besides
to
the
cinder
pond
child
the
city
streets
had
always
been
terrifying
she
had
never
visited
the
shopping
district
alone
but
there
was
a
cake
of
smelly
white
soap
to
take
to
sammy
and
an
outgrown
linen
dress
to
cut
down
for
annie
and
perhaps
allen
would
find
her
something
in
chicago
for
the
others
she
hoped
sammy
would
eat
the
soap
the
suitcase
packed
jeanne
who
was
naturally
orderly
folded
her
discarded
garments
neatly
away
in
the
dresser
drawers
no
one
would
have
guessed
that
an
excited
traveler
had
just
packed
a
good
portion
of
her
wardrobe
in
that
perfectly
neat
room
certainly
not
maggie
who
looked
in
to
tell
her
that
her
dinner
was
ready
in
the
and
not
a
soul
here
to
eat
it
but
you
added
maggie
could
i
have
it
with
my
grandfather
he
said
not
returned
maggie
i
was
setting
it
in
there
but
he
said
he
wanted
to
eat
by
himself
tonight
he
seems
different
better
maybe
sick
folks
they
say
get
a
bit
short
like
when
they
on
the
mend
at
eight
o
jeanne
tapped
at
her
grandfather
door
there
was
no
response
she
opened
the
door
very
quietly
and
went
inside
although
he
usually
sat
up
until
nine
huntington
was
in
bed
and
apparently
asleep
when
you
do
wish
to
say
to
a
person
that
you
love
very
much
and
possibly
never
expect
to
see
again
perhaps
it
is
wiser
to
pretend
that
you
are
asleep
jeanne
left
the
softest
and
lightest
of
kisses
on
the
wrinkled
hand
outside
the
cover
and
then
tiptoed
to
the
hall
to
find
james
her
only
other
farewell
had
been
given
to
the
in
her
closet
door
ready
miss
jeanne
very
well
miss
i
get
your
suitcase
better
be
starting
it
a
good
way
to
the
station
and
there
quite
a
bit
to
be
done
there
you
can
sit
in
a
snug
corner
behind
a
newspaper
while
i
buy
your
tickets
and
all
i
carry
this
said
jeanne
who
had
a
large
square
package
under
her
arm
it
my
i
shall
need
that
i
expect
to
sew
a
lot
in
bancroft
but
it
would
go
into
my
suitcase
and
james
i
left
two
of
my
newest
handkerchiefs
on
my
dresser
tomorrow
will
you
please
give
one
of
them
to
maggie
the
other
to
bridget
i
tried
to
find
something
for
you
but
there
was
a
thing
that
would
do
well
returned
james
it
is
likely
i
forget
you
and
the
madam
will
be
giving
me
cause
to
remember
you
by
tomorrow
when
jeanne
was
aboard
the
train
and
james
with
a
great
big
lump
in
his
throat
had
gulped
out
miss
and
a
pleasant
journey
to
you
she
yielded
to
the
conductor
as
much
as
he
wanted
of
her
long
yellow
ticket
unconsciously
she
imitated
what
she
called
aunt
agatha
carriage
manner
when
huntington
rode
in
any
sort
of
a
vehicle
she
always
sat
stiffly
upright
presenting
a
most
imposing
exterior
jeanne
was
a
good
many
sizes
smaller
than
aunt
agatha
but
she
too
sat
so
very
primly
that
no
stranger
would
have
of
chucking
her
under
the
chin
and
saying
hello
little
girl
where
are
going
all
by
yourself
certainly
no
one
had
ever
ventured
to
chuck
aunt
agatha
and
then
remembering
her
other
experience
in
a
sleeper
jeannette
set
about
her
preparations
for
bed
as
sedately
as
any
seasoned
traveler
she
did
one
unusual
thing
however
something
that
aunt
agatha
had
done
as
soon
as
the
curtains
had
fallen
about
her
she
drew
from
the
top
of
her
stocking
a
very
small
pasteboard
box
the
cover
was
dotted
with
small
pin
pricks
i
afraid
said
jeanne
eying
this
object
doubtfully
this
car
is
pretty
warm
maybe
i
better
raise
the
cover
just
a
little
she
slept
from
eleven
to
four
having
no
watch
she
felt
obliged
after
that
to
keep
one
drowsy
eye
on
the
scenery
she
hoped
she
should
be
able
to
recognize
chicago
when
she
saw
it
anyway
there
was
plenty
of
time
since
she
was
to
have
breakfast
on
the
train
nobody
seemed
to
be
stirring
but
had
stirred
when
jeanne
looked
into
the
little
box
on
the
window
sill
it
was
empty
making
as
little
noise
as
possible
jeanne
searched
every
inch
of
her
bed
her
curtains
her
clothes
she
even
looked
inside
her
shoes
oh
bayard
taylor
she
breathed
i
you
and
then
jeanne
was
seized
by
a
horrible
thought
goodness
she
gasped
suppose
he
in
somebody
else
bed
they
die
of
fright
as
soon
as
the
other
passengers
began
to
stir
jeanne
hurriedly
dressed
herself
then
she
pressed
the
in
her
berth
porter
said
she
i
wish
you
would
please
be
careful
when
you
make
this
bed
i
have
lost
something
you
step
on
it
yore
watch
miss
yore
pocketbook
asked
the
solicitous
porter
no
returned
jeanne
a
bit
sheepishly
just
my
pet
snail
happily
not
very
much
later
the
wandering
snail
was
safely
rescued
from
under
the
opposite
berth
is
this
yere
what
done
lost
asked
the
porter
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
as
he
restored
jeanne
property
well
i
declare
to
goodness
i
nevah
did
see
no
such
pet
as
that
befoh
in
all
mah
born
days
i
hope
said
jeanne
anxiously
that
i
can
buy
a
tiny
scrap
of
lettuce
leaf
for
his
breakfast
i
did
have
a
chance
to
bring
anything
chapter
xix
with
the
rossiters
not
only
allen
but
allen
mother
met
the
young
traveler
when
she
stepped
from
the
train
in
chicago
such
a
bright
attractive
mother
with
such
a
nice
smile
no
wonder
allen
was
a
pleasant
boy
with
gentle
manners
it
must
be
pretty
nice
thought
jeanne
to
live
with
a
mother
like
that
we
going
to
take
you
home
with
us
said
rossiter
we
brought
the
car
so
we
can
take
your
suitcase
right
along
with
us
we
have
lunch
at
home
with
allen
grandmother
she
is
very
anxious
to
see
you
she
used
to
know
your
father
people
you
know
they
were
neighbors
once
in
philadelphia
i
like
that
said
jeanne
after
lunch
we
show
you
a
little
bit
of
chicago
lincoln
park
i
think
and
then
we
give
you
some
dinner
and
put
you
on
your
train
you
need
worry
about
anything
our
young
railroad
man
here
has
it
all
fixed
up
for
you
that
lovely
said
jeanne
gratefully
any
adventures
along
the
way
asked
allen
who
had
carried
the
suitcase
and
the
too
all
the
way
to
the
automobile
only
one
said
jeanne
i
lost
bayard
taylor
he
was
a
great
american
traveler
you
know
we
had
him
in
school
was
it
a
book
asked
rossiter
perhaps
we
can
inquire
i
found
him
again
laughed
jeanne
he
was
my
pet
snail
where
is
he
now
asked
allen
in
my
stocking
confessed
jeanne
aunt
agatha
had
my
jacket
pockets
sewed
up
so
they
would
get
bulgy
you
see
i
a
kitten
or
a
baby
or
a
puppy
or
kind
of
a
pet
but
aunt
agatha
does
like
pets
her
own
children
never
had
any
but
i
just
to
have
something
and
bayard
taylor
is
it
a
snail
is
a
lovely
pet
he
is
so
small
that
nobody
notices
him
he
does
need
much
to
eat
and
he
so
easy
to
carry
around
i
hope
he
does
do
any
traveling
while
he
your
stocking
laughed
rossiter
he
in
his
little
box
said
jeanne
at
my
grandfather
i
made
a
small
yard
for
him
under
one
of
the
evergreens
with
toothpicks
stuck
all
around
in
the
clay
he
liked
that
and
the
little
clay
house
i
built
how
do
you
know
he
did
asked
allen
he
could
purr
or
wag
his
tail
he
stuck
up
his
horns
and
kept
his
appetite
the
rossiters
house
was
homelike
even
the
furniture
wore
a
friendly
look
an
affectionate
cat
rubbed
against
jeanne
stockings
and
an
old
brown
spaniel
trustfully
rested
his
nose
upon
her
knee
jeanne
liked
them
both
but
she
the
big
old
grandmother
because
she
had
so
many
pleasant
memories
of
jeanne
own
grandmother
the
finest
little
lady
i
ever
knew
said
she
an
aristocrat
to
the
very
tip
of
her
fingers
and
your
grandfather
duval
was
another
ever
so
far
back
their
people
were
huguenots
although
they
lost
their
estates
and
their
descendants
were
never
particularly
prosperous
in
business
they
were
always
refined
educated
people
your
father
met
your
mother
when
she
was
visiting
in
philadelphia
it
was
a
case
of
love
at
first
sight
and
your
mother
hostess
a
very
sentimental
woman
she
was
my
dear
rather
helped
the
matter
along
they
were
married
inside
of
three
weeks
and
you
were
born
a
year
later
in
your
house
in
philadelphia
she
died
very
shortly
after
that
and
some
business
opening
took
your
father
to
jackson
michigan
i
believe
he
and
your
mother
settled
there
her
own
people
had
not
forgiven
her
hasty
marriage
but
i
assure
you
my
dear
your
young
cousins
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
you
your
blood
is
as
good
as
theirs
her
tone
implied
that
it
was
that
enough
past
history
granny
said
allen
i
want
to
show
her
my
stamp
collection
my
coins
my
printing
press
and
my
wireless
station
on
the
roof
jeanne
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
noon
meal
she
had
supposed
that
nice
persons
be
so
jolly
and
informal
at
the
table
the
ride
through
the
park
too
was
delightful
it
lovely
she
said
to
have
this
nice
ride
the
wind
is
blowing
all
the
whirligigs
out
of
my
head
i
suppose
you
had
lots
of
rides
in
the
huntingtons
new
car
allen
says
they
have
one
not
so
very
many
it
was
always
closed
to
keep
the
dust
out
and
aunt
agatha
liked
to
sit
alone
on
the
back
seat
sometimes
she
took
pearl
or
clara
never
more
than
one
at
a
time
she
said
it
looked
common
to
fill
the
car
up
with
children
but
once
in
a
while
when
i
had
to
go
to
the
dentist
or
have
something
tried
on
i
had
a
chance
to
ride
is
there
anything
you
especially
like
to
see
asked
allen
yes
said
jeanne
promptly
i
like
a
good
look
at
lake
michigan
that
easy
said
allen
you
shall
have
looks
but
when
they
reached
a
point
from
which
lake
michigan
was
plainly
visible
jeanne
was
disappointed
are
you
sure
she
asked
that
that
it
why
yes
smiled
rossiter
what
wrong
with
it
i
thought
said
jeanne
that
all
lakes
were
blue
this
one
is
brown
it
brown
today
said
rossiter
sometimes
it
has
more
color
but
never
that
intense
blue
that
you
have
up
north
we
once
took
a
lake
trip
on
one
of
the
big
steamers
and
i
saw
your
blue
lake
then
oh
this
is
a
lake
said
jeanne
anxious
to
be
polite
but
of
course
i
more
used
to
my
own
the
rossiters
liked
their
visitor
and
urged
her
to
remain
longer
but
jeanne
very
firmly
declined
i
love
to
she
said
and
i
would
if
i
were
going
from
home
but
i
just
counting
the
minutes
it
would
be
just
like
patsy
to
grow
another
while
i
on
the
train
tonight
i
know
just
how
you
feel
assured
rossiter
but
perhaps
when
you
are
on
your
way
back
you
be
able
to
stay
longer
if
she
does
get
back
by
the
time
she
twenty
laughed
allen
going
after
her
just
remember
jeanne
i
want
to
be
on
hand
when
ready
to
decide
about
that
husband
i
should
hate
to
have
that
iceman
get
ahead
of
me
all
right
agreed
jeanne
cheerfully
just
hunt
me
up
about
six
years
from
now
if
i
have
time
to
bother
with
any
husbands
at
all
i
think
maybe
i
rather
have
you
around
than
the
iceman
be
sure
said
rossiter
at
parting
to
let
us
know
when
starting
back
this
way
i
will
promised
jeanne
i
had
a
lovely
time
everybody
and
thank
you
much
jeanne
slept
soundly
that
night
and
bayard
taylor
did
no
extra
traveling
because
allen
had
made
a
tiny
cage
for
him
from
a
small
wooden
box
with
bars
of
very
fine
wire
at
negaunee
jeanne
succeeded
in
lugging
all
her
belongings
safely
if
not
comfortably
across
the
platform
from
one
train
to
the
other
is
this
the
train
to
bancroft
she
asked
it
is
said
the
brakeman
helping
her
aboard
the
last
of
the
journey
seemed
a
year
long
she
had
had
no
breakfast
and
she
was
sure
that
patsy
had
gotten
up
earlier
than
usual
that
morning
just
on
purpose
to
never
was
train
so
slow
never
had
fourteen
miles
seemed
so
many
the
other
passengers
looked
as
if
they
had
settled
down
and
meant
to
stay
where
they
were
for
but
jeanne
was
much
too
excited
to
do
any
settling
she
wanted
to
get
off
and
push
but
at
last
a
beautiful
voice
that
is
it
sounded
like
a
beautiful
voice
to
the
impatient
little
traveler
shouted
all
off
for
bancroft
in
spite
of
her
weighty
belongings
the
first
passenger
off
that
train
was
jeannette
huntington
duval
there
was
a
in
the
station
at
bancroft
jeanne
checked
her
suitcase
allen
had
told
her
how
to
do
that
put
her
check
in
her
other
stocking
for
safe
keeping
and
then
burdened
only
with
her
set
out
to
surprise
the
duvals
her
father
she
was
sure
would
be
willing
to
go
for
the
suitcase
that
evening
he
surely
be
home
by
now
even
if
dan
mcgraw
had
taken
him
for
a
trip
no
doubt
she
had
passed
his
letter
on
the
way
and
how
those
children
would
come
whooping
down
the
dock
at
sight
of
her
the
sky
was
blue
and
all
jeanne
thoughts
were
happy
ones
chapter
xx
a
missing
family
the
walk
was
long
but
at
last
jeanne
reached
the
blossoming
bank
against
which
old
captain
freight
car
rested
nobody
home
at
old
captain
but
it
was
much
too
pleasant
a
day
for
a
fisherman
to
stay
ashore
one
of
his
nets
however
hung
over
his
queer
house
and
his
old
shoes
were
beside
his
bed
the
biggest
broadest
shoes
in
all
bancroft
there
was
no
mistaking
half
a
dozen
steps
down
the
grassy
dock
and
jeanne
stood
the
lake
all
big
and
clear
and
blue
and
just
the
same
lake
a
great
big
lump
in
her
throat
and
suddenly
the
lake
became
so
misty
that
she
could
see
it
what
a
thing
to
do
said
surprised
jeanne
wiping
away
the
fog
when
i
all
the
way
to
my
heels
i
did
believe
folks
really
cried
for
joy
but
i
guess
they
do
i
wonder
where
those
children
are
they
ought
to
be
catching
pollywogs
but
they
are
and
here
are
flowers
just
asking
to
be
picked
annie
must
be
getting
lazy
why
does
somebody
see
me
and
come
and
why
is
mollie
sitting
outside
the
door
in
the
sun
why
how
queer
the
house
looks
sort
of
shut
up
by
this
time
jeanne
was
almost
at
the
end
of
the
dock
and
her
heart
was
beating
fast
the
house
shut
up
not
only
that
but
up
from
the
outside
it
was
certainly
very
strange
and
disconcerting
puzzled
jeanne
seated
herself
on
an
old
keg
and
reflectively
eyed
her
deserted
home
they
she
decided
they
rented
a
house
somewhere
in
town
so
michael
and
sammy
can
go
to
school
it
probably
more
comfortable
but
i
know
the
yard
is
half
so
beautiful
by
and
by
when
i
can
stop
looking
at
the
lake
i
find
something
to
eat
in
old
captain
house
i
just
about
starved
i
have
to
wait
until
he
comes
home
to
find
out
about
everybody
i
why
nobody
told
me
it
was
five
when
barney
boat
touched
at
the
dock
old
captain
climbed
out
barney
followed
together
they
picked
their
way
along
the
crumbling
wharf
something
brown
a
brown
that
caught
the
glow
from
the
afternoon
sun
was
curled
on
captain
blossom
doorstep
when
you
traveled
for
two
nights
and
spent
a
long
day
outdoors
on
a
breezy
wharf
exploring
all
the
haunts
of
your
childhood
sleep
comes
easily
there
was
jeanne
her
head
on
her
elbow
sound
asleep
barney
took
one
good
look
at
the
small
brunette
face
and
then
as
if
all
the
bad
dreams
he
had
had
had
gotten
after
him
at
once
fled
up
the
steep
bank
behind
old
captain
car
and
was
gone
the
captain
when
he
had
recognized
his
sleeping
visitor
looked
as
if
he
too
would
have
been
glad
to
flee
so
so
he
muttered
helplessly
wringing
his
big
hands
darned
if
i
hum
ladies
present
dinged
if
i
know
what
to
do
suddenly
jeanne
sat
up
and
looked
at
him
next
she
had
flown
at
him
and
had
kissed
both
of
his
broad
red
cheeks
well
she
exclaimed
it
you
were
coming
home
where
is
my
father
where
well
you
see
said
old
captain
patting
her
gently
they
ai
well
they
ai
exactly
i
can
that
returned
jeanne
exasperated
by
the
remarkable
slowness
but
where
they
well
now
jeannie
girl
maybe
your
father
wrote
you
about
shannon
son
john
takin
her
away
to
louis
last
spring
well
he
done
it
yes
after
well
after
a
while
mollie
was
took
sick
you
see
there
was
some
sort
o
reason
for
that
there
laziness
of
hern
there
was
something
wrong
with
her
inside
her
brother
john
come
i
telegraphed
him
and
had
her
took
to
a
hospital
up
at
mary
side
of
town

there

ai
to
come

jeanne
her
eyes
very
big
oh
mollie
she
just
as
contented
as
ever
assured
the
captain
whose
consoling
pats
had
grown
stronger
and
stronger
until
now
they
were
so
nearly
that
jeanne
winced
under
them
i
take
you
to
see
her
first
chance
i
git
she

the
captain
who

stopped
patting
jeanne
to
wipe
large
beads
of
perspiration

a
hungry
man
and
i
got
a
heap
o
work

while

jeanne
finding
no
cloth
spread
clean
newspapers
over
the
greasy
table
scoured
two
knives
and
a
pair
of
forks
with
clean
white
sand
from
the
beach
and
set
out
two
very
thick
plates
one
cup
and
a
saucer
after
that
she
washed
the
teapot
and
found
old
captain
caddy
of
strong
green
tea
then
she
picked
up
a
basket
of
bits
of
snowy
driftwood
from
the
beach
such
clean
smooth
pieces
that
it
seemed
a
pity
to
burn
them
yet
nothing
made
a
more
pleasing
fire
presently
old
captain
returned
with
jeanne
suitcase
with
him
was
a
breathless
boy
who
had
found
it
difficult
to
keep
up
with
the
long
stride
the
boy
basket
contained
bread
butter
eggs
and
a
piece
of
round
steak
also
there
was
a
bundle
containing
a
sheet
and
them
thar
a
present
for
explained
old
captain
they
was
somethin
the
matter
with
the
towels
had
in
i
guess
stiff
as
a
board
anyhow
but
your
paw
left
some
in
his
room
where
my
now
i
returned
old
captain
hastily
cookin
i
ai
answerin
no
questions
i
you
can
tell
me
how
you
got
here
and
what
started
ye
i
dyin
to
hear
all
about
it
but
you
ca
ask
no
questions
and
just
remember
this
i
darn
glad
hum
glad
you
come
this
here
a
lonesome
place
with
no
children
runnin
and
i
mighty
glad
to
hear
twitterin
besides
them
swallows
so
just
twitter
away
first
of
all
who
brung
you
in
spite
of
her
dismay
at
mollie
illness
in
spite
of
her
keen
disappointment
regarding
the
missing
children
in
spite
of
her
bewilderment
and
her
growing
fear
concerning
her
strangely
absent
father
jeanne
was
conscious
of
a
warm
glow
of
happiness
even
if
had
been
gone
the
cinder
pond
more
beautiful
than
ever
would
still
have
been
but
old
captain
hearty
welcome
and
more
than
all
the
kindliness
that
seemed
to
radiate
from
his
broad
ruddy
face
seemed
to
enfold
her
like
a
warm
woolly
bathrobe
the
captain
was
rough
and
uncultured
but
you
could
look
at
him
without
knowing
that
he
was
supper
was
a
bit
late
that
night
jeanne
very
neat
in
her
brown
poplin
dress
old
captain
very
comfortable
in
his
faded
ate
it
by
lamplight
at
the
captain
small
square
table
truly
an
oddly
contrasted
pair
but
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
captain
heart
was
much
better
than
his
table
manners
jeanne
was
able
to
eat
enough
for
small
girls
after
supper
the
captain
lighted
a
big
lantern
collected
his
tools
and
trudged
down
the
cindery
road
to
the
duval
corner
of
the
old
wharf
presently
jeanne
who
was
clearing
away
after
the
meal
heard
the
sound
of
hammering
and
the
squawk
of
nails
being
pulled
from
wood
noises
travel
far
over
water
that
is
quiet
when
she
had
washed
and
dried
the
dishes
she
followed
old
captain
thought
ye
come
too
did
ye
well
she
all
opened
up
you
best
take
your
father
room
for
tonight
anyway
it
ai
been
disturbed
since
hum
the
blankets
is
all
right
i
guess
there
a
bolt
on
the
door
better
lock
yourself
in
few
boats
ever
touches
here
but
one
come
i
hate
like
thunder
to
have
ye
kidnapped
would
want
to
lose
ye
so
soon
did
you
bring
along
that
sheet
good
i
leave
you
the
lamp
while
i
fixes
up
a
bunk
in
mollie
part
of
the
house
for
my
old
bones
the
little
room
seemed
full
of
her
father
presence
an
old
coat
hung
behind
the
door
the
little
old
trunk
stood
against
the
wall
on
the
big
box
that
served
for
a
table
with
a
mark
to
keep
the
place
was
a
library
book
happily
sleepy
jeanne
did
not
think
of
looking
at
the
card
if
she
looked
she
would
have
learned
that
the
book
was
long
overdue
thanks
to
the
big
clean
lake
and
the
wharf
there
was
no
dust
to
show
how
long
the
place
had
been
untenanted
the
music
of
the
water
rippling
under
the
old
dock
how
sweet
it
was
the
air
that
blew
in
at
her
open
window
how
good
and
how
soothing
the
bright
stars
peeping
in
through
the
little
square
seemed
such
stars
even
the
cold
stiffness
of
the
sheet
was
not
sufficiently
disturbing
to
keep
the
tired
little
girl
awake
she
found
her
breakfast
on
the
captain
stove
just
in
time
for
the
fire
was
out
and
a
chipmunk
perched
on
the
edge
of
the
was
nibbling
a
bit
of
fried
potato
the
captain
had
disappeared
jeanne
did
guess
that
he
had
purposely
fled
there
so
much
to
do
said
jeanne
eying
the
captain
grimy
teakettle
after
she
had
finished
her
breakfast
that
i
do
know
where
to
begin
if
i
could
find
my
old
pink
dress
i
know
what
i
do
i
something
and
make
me
a
great
big
apron
even
my
everyday
clothes
are
too
good
for
a
working
lady
but
first
i
guess
i
clean
the
room
old
captain
slept
in
mollie
kept
a
lot
of
old
stuff
that
ought
to
be
thrown
away
i
hope
there
are
any
rats
and
i
remember
to
mail
the
letter
that
i
wrote
to
my
grandfather
just
before
i
got
to
chicago
it
still
in
my
i
think
some
fresh
hay
would
be
nice
for
the
captain
bunk
there
a
lot
of
long
grass
on
top
of
the
bank
perhaps
i
can
cut
some
of
that
and
dry
it
i
used
to
love
to
do
that
i
could
make
fresh
pillows
too
but
i
have
something
to
work
in
a
very
ragged
blue
cotton
shirt
of
old
captain
was
finally
pressed
into
service
of
course
it
was
much
too
big
but
jeanne
tied
up
the
flopping
sleeves
with
bits
of
twine
found
the
captain
broom
and
marched
down
the
dock
the
morning
was
gone
by
the
time
old
captain
new
room
was
cleared
of
rubbish
jeanne
clad
mostly
in
the
old
blue
shirt
dumped
it
into
the
lake
once
her
work
had
been
interrupted
by
an
old
man
who
wanted
to
buy
a
fish
jeanne
giggling
at
a
sudden
amusing
thought
trotted
down
the
dock
to
sell
it
to
him
from
the
end
of
the
captain
car
the
business
now
was
mostly
a
wholesale
one
but
neither
jeanne
nor
the
customer
knew
that
so
the
fish
were
ungrudgingly
displayed
be
you
the
fishman
little
girl
he
asked
as
jeanne
weighed
the
trout
he
had
selected
i
she
returned
gravely
but
as
soon
as
the
customer
was
out
of
earshot
jeanne
amusing
thought
became
too
much
for
her
if
aunt
agatha
could
see
me
now
she
giggled
she
drop
into
the
cinder
pond
and
what
a
splendid
splash
she
make
think
of
aunt
agatha
niece
selling
a
fish
i
hope
i
charged
him
enough
for
it
he
looked
as
if
he
thought
it
a
good
deal
it
a
good
deal
the
captain
chuckled
when
she
told
him
about
it
you
make
money
at
the
business
said
he
but
i
ai
going
to
have
sellin
fish
besides
we
ships
most
of
wholesale
out
of
town
they
been
none
in
that
there
box
if
barney
been
tendin
to
business
chapter
xxi
old
captain
news
when
jeanne
had
finished
her
morning
housecleaning
the
room
contained
only
the
two
bunks
one
above
another
a
small
a
battered
table
that
had
once
belonged
to
shannon
a
plain
wooden
chair
and
a
bench
some
day
said
jeanne
i
that
furniture
but
if
i
eat
something
now
i
i
glad
james
gave
me
too
much
money
and
i
have
nineteen
dollars
in
my
pincushion
after
i
had
lunch
i
go
shopping
for
i
need
a
lot
of
things
old
captain
shall
have
sheets
too
and
i
buy
some
cheap
stuff
for
curtains
it
be
fun
to
make
them
and
put
them
up
i
wonder
if
oilcloth
like
aunt
agatha
had
in
her
kitchen
costs
very
much
that
would
be
pleasanter
to
eat
on
than
newspapers
and
very
easy
to
white
would
be
nicest
i
think
and
if
i
could
buy
some
pieces
of
rag
carpet
my
floor
is
pretty
cold
it
was
rather
a
long
way
to
town
but
jeannette
freshened
by
a
bath
in
the
cinder
pond
and
clad
in
a
clean
linen
frock
trudged
along
the
road
until
she
reached
the
sidewalk
here
she
unfolded
something
that
she
carried
in
her
hand
a
small
square
of
cloth
with
it
she
carefully
wiped
the
dust
from
her
shoes
there
said
she
throwing
away
the
rag
the
cinder
pond
savage
looks
a
little
more
like
jeannette
huntington
duval
she
proved
a
better
shopper
than
old
captain
a
new
store
provided
her
with
some
excellent
plated
knives
forks
and
teaspoons
she
bought
three
of
each
barney
might
want
to
stay
to
supper
sometime
also
a
nice
smooth
saucepan
some
fruit
some
rolls
some
cookies
besides
the
white
oilcloth
which
had
proved
inexpensive
and
some
other
drygoods
so
many
things
in
fact
that
she
wondered
how
to
get
them
home
illustration
she
almost
bumped
into
a
former
acquaintance
where
asked
the
clerk
at
the
last
place
shall
i
send
this
it
out
quite
a
little
beyond
the
town
said
jeanne
doubtfully
this
side
of
the
lighthouse
yes
well
we
send
it
for
you
the
wagon
is
going
to
the
station
today
i
send
your
other
parcels
too
if
you
like
good
said
jeanne
who
meant
to
watch
for
the
wagon
where
the
road
turned
now
i
be
able
to
buy
one
or
two
more
things
jeanne
knew
no
one
in
the
little
town
when
you
live
on
a
dock
your
nearest
neighbors
are
apt
to
be
seagulls
but
as
she
turned
the
corner
near
the
post
office
where
she
was
going
to
buy
stamps
she
almost
bumped
into
a
former
acquaintance
it
was
roger
fairchild
the
boy
that
she
had
rescued
more
than
two
years
previously
roger
was
taller
but
he
was
still
quite
plump
oh
gasped
jeanne
recognizing
him
the
water
spoil
your
clothes
i
always
wondered
about
that
roger
looked
at
her
sharply
was
it
yes
it
that
little
shrimp
of
a
girl
that
had
pulled
him
out
of
the
lake
she
had
grown
a
but
she
was
that
same
child
the
tomatoes
in
the
corner
grocery
were
no
redder
than
roger
turned
in
that
moment
aw
muttered
embarrassed
roger
brushing
past
her
i
know
yuh
jeanne
felt
slightly
abashed
i
sure
thought
she
glancing
after
him
that
that
the
same
boy
there
ca
be
as
fat
as
that
probably
he
does
know
me
in
these
clothes
next
time
i
say
a
little
more
of
course
jeanne
had
learned
under
the
huntington
roof
that
introductions
were
customary
but
you
see
when
you
saved
a
life
you
feel
as
if
that
event
were
introduction
enough
without
further
ceremony
also
when
you
been
kind
to
anybody
even
an
ungrateful
boy
you
have
a
friendly
feeling
for
him
afterwards
besides
jeanne
rather
liked
boys
in
a
wholesome
sort
of
way
but
if
roger
seemingly
lacked
gratitude
his
mother
did
not
she
knew
that
lake
superior
was
both
deep
and
cold
and
that
even
the
best
of
swimmers
had
been
drowned
in
its
icy
waters
she
felt
that
she
owed
a
large
debt
of
thanks
to
the
tall
mysterious
young
woman
who
had
saved
her
only
child
from
certain
death
for
two
years
she
had
longed
to
pay
that
debt
the
captain
and
barney
were
landing
when
jeanne
reached
the
freight
car
she
ran
down
to
hold
out
a
hand
to
barney
but
barney
put
his
big
hands
behind
his
back
they
ai
clean
said
he
then
he
turned
to
old
captain
and
spoke
in
an
undertone
got
to
tell
her
he
said
i
know
i
promised
but
i
ca
i
guess
it
got
to
be
did
sighed
the
old
captain
but
you
got
to
stand
by
this
part
of
the
wharf
remarked
jeanne
looks
a
great
deal
battered
up
are
some
of
the
timbers
gone
yes
returned
old
captain
you
see
there
was
a
bad
storm
last
may
barney
was
out
in
it
it
it
damaged
his
boat
some
was
barney
alone
no
your
father
and
michael
was
with
him
barney
demanded
jeanne
where
my
father
barney
who
was
scooping
fish
into
a
basket
grabbed
the
handle
and
strode
away
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
would
carry
him
old
captain
shouted
barney
but
the
younger
man
did
not
pause
jeannie
girl
said
old
captain
as
they
followed
barney
down
the
wharf
barney
to
meet
you
but
he
ai
got
no
call
to
be
what
happened
were
fault
but
he
thinks
you
hate
him
like
when
you
know
happened
pleaded
jeanne
pale
with
dread
it
was
like
this
the
squall
came
up
sudden
an
the
boat
went
over
a
tug
picked
barney
up
he
was
hangin
on
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
and
daddy
there
was
nobody
there
when
the
tug
come
but
barney
was
my
father
you
said
daddy
and
michael
they
go
out
that
day
they
surely
go
in
the
boat
yes
returned
old
captain
sorrowfully
they
went
and
they
come
back
that
all
they
went
and
they
did
come
back
they
went
and
they
did
come
back
jeanne
feet
kept
time
to
the
words
as
the
pair
walked
up
the
dock
they
went
and
they
did
come
back
jeanne
could
believe
it
yet
somehow
she
had
known
it
all
that
summer
in
spite
of
her
brave
assurances
to
herself
she
had
felt
fatherless
the
fatherless
feeling
had
been
justified
yet
she
believe
it
her
precious
father
and
poor
little
michael
maybe
maybe
you
want
to
go
inside
and
cry
a
bit
suggested
the
worried
captain
shall
i
just
hang
about
outside
jeanne
dropped
to
the
bench
outside
the
car
her
eyes
very
wide
open
but
perfectly
tearless
were
fixed
on
old
captain
her
cheeks
were
white
even
her
lips
were
colorless
captain
blossom
did
know
to
do
a
crying
child
could
be
soothed
and
comforted
with
kind
words
but
this
frozen
image
this
little
white
girl
with
wide
black
eyes
staring
through
him
at
the
lake
what
a
rough
old
sailorman
do
to
help
her
suddenly
a
lanky
bowlegged
boy
with
big
red
ears
that
almost
flopped
came
the
corner
of
the
car
say
said
he
i
looking
for
a
party
named
jane
et
a
hungry
devil
looks
like
right
here
returned
old
captain
it
jeannette
huntington
every
inch
of
that
boy
was
funny
even
his
queer
voice
was
provocative
of
mirth
jeanne
but
the
boy
had
barely
turned
the
corner
before
surprised
jeanne
a
little
heap
on
the
bench
was
sobbing
sobs
a
great
many
sizes
too
large
for
her
small
body
it
soaked
in
said
the
captain
patting
her
ponderously
there
there
jeannie
girl
there
there
just
cry
all
ye
want
to
i
cried
some
myself
when
i
heard
about
it
presently
the
big
old
captain
went
inside
his
old
car
and
there
was
a
great
clatter
among
the
cooking
utensils
mingled
with
a
sort
of
muffled
roar
he
was
working
off
his
overcharged
feelings
jeanne
sobs
having
gradually
subsided
she
began
to
be
conscious
of
the
unusual
disturbance
inside
the
car
next
she
listened
and
that
old
captain
was
saying
bad
words
but
hum
ladies
present
rose
suddenly
above
the
clatter
of
dishes
the
silence
followed
by
dumbed
if
she
has
eaten
all
the
bread
right
after
that
the
listening
captain
heard
the
sound
of
tearing
paper
a
moment
later
jeanne
was
in
the
doorway
a
loaf
of
bread
in
one
hand
a
basket
of
peaches
in
the
other
her
face
was
but
her
eyes
were
brave
she
even
smiled
a
little
twisty
smile
a
smile
that
all
but
upset
old
captain
there
some
rolls
too
she
said
in
rather
a
shaky
voice
take
these
and
i
bring
you
the
tablecloth
after
this
i
going
to
be
the
supper
cook
i
planned
it
all
out
this
morning
jeanne
brave
little
soul
that
she
was
was
back
among
the
everyday
things
of
life
the
greatly
relieved
captain
beamed
at
the
shining
white
tablecloth
and
the
cheap
plated
silver
he
picked
up
one
of
the
new
knives
and
viewed
it
admiringly
i
ai
et
with
a
shiny
knife
like
this
since
i
was
keepin
hall
said
he
i
just
admire
eatin
fried
potatoes
with
this
here
knife
the
captain
was
very
sociable
that
evening
he
had
to
see
the
contents
of
all
the
parcels
and
expressed
great
admiration
for
the
checked
gingham
that
was
to
be
made
into
a
big
apron
once
he
disappeared
to
rummage
about
in
the
dark
further
end
of
the
long
car
presently
he
returned
with
a
rusty
tin
box
this
here
said
he
is
my
bank
he
opened
it
it
was
filled
with
money

he

where
the
lantern
at
the
door
of
the
duval
shack
jeanne
stumbled
over
something
a
large
basket
with
the
cover
fastened
down
tight
jeanne
carried
it
inside
and
lifted
the
cover
it
contained
four
small
kittens
and
a
bottle
of
milk
a
card
hung
from
the
neck
of
the
bottle
on
it
was
printed

said
the
captain
them
kittens

jeanne

i

barney

a
pretty
silvery
gray
with

under

chins
i

me
a
nice
mother
by
the
time
the
kittens
were
fed
and
asleep
jeanne
who
had
certainly
spent
an
exhausting
day
was
no
longer
able
to
keep
her
eyes
open

old
captain
at
breakfast
time
our
cupboard

pretty
bare
of
bacon

ginerally

somethin

a

a
grand
bunch
for
a
quarter
quite
a
walk
to
that
there
hospital
so

too
much
work
but
i
sure

enjoy
my
room
last
night
all
clean
an
wait
till
said
jeanne
you
have
will
i
returned
old
captain
a
bit
doubtfully
well
i
get
used
to
they
does
dress
up
a
bed
in
spite
of
the
squealing
kittens
in
spite
of
the
many
small
tasks
that
jeanne
found
to
do
many
times
that
morning
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
poor
daddy
and
michael
to
go
like
that
curiously
enough
the
remembrance
of
a
drowned
sailor
whose
body
had
once
been
washed
up
on
the
beach
near
the
dock
brought
jeanne
a
certain
sense
of
comfort
the
sailor
had
looked
as
if
he
had
he
was
dead
and
he
he
had
looked
peaceful
almost
happy
as
if
his
body
was
just
an
old
one
that
he
had
been
rather
glad
to
throw
away
his
soul
léon
duval
had
said
when
he
found
his
small
daughter
in
the
little
crowd
of
bystanders
on
the
beach
is
there
that
is
only
his
body
the
man
himself
is
elsewhere
does
care
said
jeanne
and
tried
to
be
happy
in
that
comforting
thought
that
afternoon
they
visited
mollie
this
bein
a
special
occasion
said
old
captain
i
got
fruit
and
flowers
you
kin
carry
the
bouquet
it
took
courage
to
carry
it
but
jeanne
rose
nobly
to
the
occasion
she
could
help
giggling
however
when
she
tried
to
picture
huntington
suddenly
presented
with
a
similar
offering
there
was
a
tiger
lily
in
the
center
surrounded
by
pink
outside
of
this
successive
rings
of
orange
marigolds
purple
asters
scarlet
geraniums
and
candytuft
with
a
final
fringe
of
blue
cornflowers
if
i
meet
that
fat
boy
thought
jeanne
wickedly
i
bow
to
him
once
i
took
a
one
confessed
captain
blossom
with
a
pleased
glance
at
the
bouquet
but
the
nurse
she
said
colored
flowers
they
more
cheerful
it
cheerful
says
i
to
now
that
there
cheerful
ai
it
yes
agreed
jeanne
it
even
at
aunt
agatha
biggest
dinner
party
there
was
a
cheerful
one
than
this
i
sure
mollie
will
like
it
but
that
mollie
that
absolutely
neat
white
creature
in
the
neat
white
bed
there
was
the
pale
red
hair
neatly
braided
in
a
shining
halo
above
the
serene
forehead
the
mild
blue
eyes
looked
lazily
at
the
bouquet
then
at
jeanne
the
old
smile
curved
her
lips
hello
jeanne
she
said
you
lookin
fine
you
see
i
sick
abed
but
i
real
comfortable
real
comfortable
and
happy
then
she
fell
asleep
it
the
medicine
said
the
nurse
she
sleeps
most
of
the
time
but
even
when
she
awake
nothing
troubles
her
nothin
ever
did
returned
old
captain
but
then
there
some
that
worries
much
they
met
barney
in
the
road
above
the
dock
jeanne
held
out
her
hand
big
barney
gripped
it
with
both
of
his
squeezed
it
hard
and
fled
you
tell
him
said
jeanne
with
the
little
twisty
smile
that
was
not
very
far
from
tears
to
come
to
dinner
tomorrow
that
invited
him
and
am
going
to
make
him
a
pudding
poor
old
barney
we
got
to
make
him
feel
comfortable
tell
him
i
bought
a
fork
no
a
especially
for
him
barney
as
good
as
gold
returned
old
captain
but
for
a
man
of
he
too
dinged
shy
says
i
once
ought
to
get
married
as
good
fish
in
the
sea
as
ever
come
out
says
barney
says
i
ai
the
bait
gittin
some
stale
is
it
september
asked
jeanne
one
morning
studying
the
little
calendar
she
had
found
in
her
today
the
fourteenth
replied
old
captain
what
of
it
i
worried
said
jeanne
i
came
to
make
a
but
i
heard
a
word
from
aunt
agatha
or
my
grandfather
about
going
back
or
of
course
i
to
be
in
school
there
a
good
school
here
you
have
clothes
an
can
get
more
i
do
to
go
back
to
aunt
agatha
you
know
i
sure
angry
at
me
for
running
away
it
took
her
a
long
long
time
to
get
over
it
after
i
went
swimming
in
the
fountain
i
suppose
this
is
worse
well
this
here
were
exactly
your
fault
i
bothered
about
my
grandfather
too
i
written
to
him
four
times
and
i
have
heard
a
you
told
them
about
your
father
no
confessed
jeanne
i
did
i
write
about
it
to
aunt
agatha
she
despised
him
and
i
heard
james
say
that
any
bad
news
or
very
sudden
would
would
bring
on
another
one
of
those
strokes
of
course
they
think
i
with
daddy
i
did
think
of
that
i
did
to
deceive
anybody
well
said
old
captain
i
guess
your
idee
of
not
startling
your
was
all
right
but
you
better
write
your
aunt
agathy
some
day
an
tell
her
about
your
father
there
no
hurry
i
you
stayed
right
here
and
i
rather
stay
then
stay

do
but
before
real
cold
weather
comes
we
got
ta
fix
up
some
place
ashore
for
you
where

good
fire

build
on
an
addition
behind
this
here
car
say
two
good
rooms
with
a
door
through

while

an
if

was

that
i
there

agreed
jeanne
on
saturday
jeanne
went
up
town
to
buy
food
but
first
she
visited
the
store
to
buy
an
just
outside
she
came
face
to
face
with
roger
fairchild
and
his
mother
jeanne
an
impish
light
in
her
black
eyes
she
was
only
sorry
that
she
was
carrying
one
of
schmidt
outrageous
bouquets
stopped
square
in
front
of
the
stout
boy
and
said
you
spoil
your
clothes
as
before
roger
turned
several
shades
of
crimson
jeanne
did
not
look
almost
fourteen
for
she
was
still
rather
small
for
her
years
you
persisted
his
tormenter
yes
i
did
growled
roger
hurry
on
mother
i
got
ta
get
a
haircut
as
soon
as
we
had
that
ice
cream
jeanne
explained
the
matter
to
old
captain
who
had
heard
about
the
accident
to
roger
he
one
of
the
kind
of
boys
you
can
said
jeanne
i
afraid
i
to
tease
just
a
little
he
looks
like
sort
of
a
does
he
meanwhile
the
boy
mother
was
questioning
her
curiously
embarrassed
son
roger
said
she
who
that
pretty
child
and
what
did
she
mean
i
dunno
fibbed
roger
yes
you
clothes
oh
old
ones
do
bother
i
on
knowing
aw
what
the
use
the
ones
that
got
in
the
lake
and
shrunk
so
i
could
wear
mumbled
roger
come
on
here
the
place
how
did
know
about
your
clothes
persisted
fairchild
aw
growled
roger
she
was
hangin
when
you
fell
in
demanded
fairchild
eagerly
does
she
know
that
noble
girl
that
saved
you
does
she
she
roger
oh
i
so
said
roger
how
should
know
come
on
your
ice
cream
get
cold
but
roger
say
said
desperate
roger
whose
chin
was
as
smooth
as
his
mother
if
you
ever
buy
me
a
razor
i
wish
you
buy
kind
here
in
this
window
look
at
it
that
a
razor
a
razor
gasped
fairchild
what
in
the
world
roger
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
his
mother
had
been
switched
from
that
miserable
cinder
pond
child
he
chatted
so
freely
about
razors
that
his
mother
was
far
from
guessing
that
he
knew
as
little
about
them
as
she
did
fancy
you
wanting
a
razor
commented
his
astonished
mother
there
no
great
rush
admitted
roger
feeling
his
smooth
cheek
but
i
bet
i
get
whiskers
before
you
do
they
be
pink
like
your
eyebrows
retaliated
fairchild
but
never
mind
my
eyebrows
grew
darker
and
yours
will
gee
thought
roger
i
glad
i
thought
of
that
razor
that
was
a
close
shave
chapter

a
new
friend
for
jeanne
the
very
next
day
when
old
captain
and
jeanne
were
coming
away
from
the
hospital
they
met
fairchild
going
in
to
visit
a
sick
friend
the
impulsive
little
lady
pounced
upon
jeanne
please
do
think
that
i
crazy
said
she
in
a
voice
that
jeanne
considered
decidedly
pleasing
but
you
the
person
i
wish
to
see
one
day
more
than
two
years
ago
my
son
roger
fell
into
lake
superior
and
was
drowned
he
says
that
you
know
the
girl
a
very
girl
roger
said
she
was
that
saved
his
life
just
think
not
a
word
of
thanks
have
i
ever
been
able
to
give
her
i
am
anxious
to
meet
that
brave
girl
well
said
old
captain
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
you
meetin
her
right
now
she
tore
a
hole
two
feet
across
that
there
net
o
mine
savin
your
boy
that
how
i
come
to
know
about
it
not
this
girl
it
was
mostly
the
net
said
jeanne
modestly
i
just
threw
it
over
the
place
where
he
went
down
his
fingers
to
grab
it
i
lived
right
there
you
know
and
i
had
pulled
my
little
brother
sammy
out
ever
so
many
times
he
was
tumbling
in
my
dear
declared
fairchild
i
going
home
with
you
i
want
to
see
the
exact
spot
roger
has
always
been
so
vague
about
it
get
into
my
car
it
just
outside
the
gate
and
i
drive
you
there
i
must
run
in
here
first
but
i
wo
stay
two
minutes
it
was
old
captain
first
ride
in
an
automobile
and
he
was
surprised
to
find
himself
within
sight
of
his
own
home
in
a
very
few
minutes
after
leaving
the
hospital
this
here
buggy
some
traveler
said
he
admiringly
they
escorted
fairchild
to
the
end
of
the
dock
to
show
her
the
spot
from
which
roger
had
taken
his
dangerous
plunge
she
looked
down
into
the
green
depths
and
shuddered
ugh
she
said
it
a
mile
deep
oh
i
thankful
you
happened
to
be
here
next
she
inspected
the
shack
on
the
dock
after
that
the
captain
old
freight
car
and
you
here
she
said
seating
herself
on
the
bench
outside
and
drawing
jeanne
down
beside
her
i
want
you
to
tell
me
all
about
it
and
about
i
want
your
whole
history
by
asking
a
great
many
questions
she
had
lived
with
roger
long
enough
to
learn
how
to
do
that
she
soon
knew
a
great
deal
about
jeanne
her
life
on
the
wharf
her
two
years
with
the
huntingtons
her
wishes
for
her
jeanne
found
it
not
only
easy
but
pleasant
to
chatter
to
her
sympathetic
new
acquaintance
this
is
a
beautiful
spot
in
summer
said
fairchild
when
she
had
the
whole
story
but
it
is
no
place
for
a
girl
in
winter
the
minute
cold
weather
comes
unless
your
people
have
already
sent
for
you
i
am
going
to
carry
you
off
to
visit
me
of
course
if
you
did
happen
to
like
us
you
would
have
to
stay
but
i
do
want
you
to
try
us
know
who
fairchild
is
captain
blossom
the
lawyer
you
know
so
you
see
you
can
trust
us
with
her
at
any
rate
my
dear
you
can
stay
with
me
until
your
people
send
for
you
you
see
neither
fairchild
nor
i
will
be
able
to
rest
until
we
had
a
chance
to
know
you
better
and
to
thank
you
to
thank
you
i
grateful
to
you
our
only
child
you
saved
him
for
us
i
had
you
on
my
conscience
for
more
than
two
years
you
come
wo
you
if
i
could
think
about
it
just
a
little
said
jeanne
shyly
you
must
persuade
her
captain
blossom
you
she
be
better
off
with
me
so
much
nearer
school
and
other
nice
girls
of
her
own
age
i
shall
simply
love
to
have
her
i
fond
of
her
already
fairchild
was
a
pretty
little
woman
impulsive
and
very
loyal
in
her
friendships
one
had
only
to
look
at
her
to
know
that
she
was
good
not
a
very
wise
woman
perhaps
but
a
very
kind
one
her
son
roger
she
had
lost
her
first
two
babies
was
undoubtedly
rather
badly
spoiled
had
her
other
children
lived
roger
would
certainly
have
been
more
severely
disciplined
i
coming
tomorrow
afternoon
said
she
at
parting
to
take
this
little
girl
for
a
ride
that
be
lovely
returned
jeanne
after
that
fairchild
made
a
point
of
borrowing
jeanne
frequently
her
comfortable
little
open
car
often
stopped
in
the
road
above
the
captain
old
freight
car
to
honk
loudly
for
jeanne
and
she
often
carried
the
cinder
pond
child
home
with
her
and
kept
her
to
meals
fairchild
was
the
nearest
approach
to
a
girl
companion
that
jeanne
had
ever
had
jeanne
the
pretty
lady
who
was
so
delightfully
young
for
her
years
she
also
liked
fairchild
child
whose
clothes
were
quite
as
good
as
those
of
her
uncle
charles
while
his
manners
were
certainly
better
at
any
rate
far
more
cordial
i
crazy
about
dolls
confessed
fairchild
one
day
when
she
had
jeanne
beside
her
in
the
little
car
i
promised
to
dress
a
whole
dozen
for
the
church
guild
i
want
you
to
help
me
buy
them
right
now
wo
that
be
fun
and
we
dress
them
together
you
shall
choose
the
dresses
for
six
of
them
is
it
a
shame
i
never
had
any
little
girls
of
my
own
of
course
sympathetic
fairchild
heard
all
about
sammy
annie
and
patsy
and
how
disappointed
jeanne
had
been
to
find
them
missing
i
about
them
confessed
jeanne
their
new
uncle
be
good
to
them
but
i
like
to
know
for
i
bothered
most
about
annie
she
such
a
good
gentle
little
thing
and
shannon
was
always
awfully
cross
to
her
while
we
dressing
our
other
dolls
said
fairchild
we
might
make
a
little
dress
for
annie
she
almost
six
sighed
jeanne
i
do
wish
i
could
watch
her
grow
up
and
teach
her
to
be
but
of
course
making
a
dress
for
her
will
help
a
little
of
roger
jeanne
saw
but
little
at
first
he
avoided
her
still
he
speak
when
they
met
face
to
face
and
in
the
course
of
time
he
was
even
able
to
say
hello
jeanne
without
blushing
jeanne
went
to
school
it
was
a
long
walk
and
she
hated
to
miss
a
single
moment
of
the
outdoor
life
on
the
old
dock
but
going
to
school
was
something
that
she
could
do
for
her
father
her
clothes
were
beginning
to
trouble
her
a
little
some
were
wearing
out
others
seemed
to
be
getting
smaller
jeanne
you
see
was
growing
and
her
garments
were
not
still
the
other
pupils
were
far
from
suspecting
that
jeanne
was
a
motherless
fatherless
waif
from
the
cinder
pond
she
was
always
neat
and
even
daintier
than
many
of
her
classmates
but
the
washing
ironing
and
mending
necessary
to
insure
this
daintiness
meant
considerable
work
on
jeanne
part
one
evening
when
she
had
taken
off
her
dress
to
replace
a
button
it
occurred
to
jeanne
to
feel
in
the
pockets
of
her
father
old
coat
the
coat
that
still
hung
behind
the
door
of
léon
duval
room
she
found
in
the
pocket
a
letter
that
he
had
written
except
for
a
stamp
it
was
all
ready
to
be
mailed
to
she
read
it
greedily
there
was
the
usual
home
news
but
one
paragraph
stood
out
from
all
the
others
be
patient
and
learn
all
you
can
my
jeanne
you
in
turn
can
teach
it
all
to
annie
and
your
brothers
even
the
hated
arithmetic
you
must
conquer
oh
sighed
jeanne
i
so
glad
i
found
this
i
conquer
those
mathematics
and
i
teach
those
children
some
day
perhaps
have
to
teach
kindergarten
after
all
so
as
to
earn
money
enough
to
go
after
them
and
dear
me
they
growing
older
every
minute
but
no
matter
how
hard
it
is
for
me
i
going
to
look
after
those
children
the
very
first
minute
i
can
while
jeanne
was
waiting
for
the
first
cold
weather
or
else
for
news
from
the
huntingtons
one
tell
which
would
come
first
she
studied
to
such
purpose
that
her
first
month
marks
surprised
even
herself
they
were
so
good
another
night
when
she
had
gone
early
to
the
shack
in
order
to
mend
a
long
rent
in
her
petticoat
she
found
herself
with
half
an
hour
to
spare
before
bedtime
she
had
left
her
books
on
old
captain
table
and
the
kittens
were
also
in
the
captain
car
for
once
now
that
her
mending
was
finished
she
had
nothing
to
do
unless
she
were
to
dress
and
go
up
the
dock
to
old
captain
and
that
she
decided
was
too
much
trouble
for
so
short
a
time
she
was
obliged
to
stand
on
a
box
to
reach
the
nail
she
liked
best
for
her
dress
as
she
did
so
this
time
the
lamplight
fell
upon
a
crack
in
the
wall
that
was
level
with
her
eyes
and
contained
something
that
suddenly
glittered
she
fished
the
small
object
from
its
and
recognized
in
it
the
key
to
her
father
little
old
trunk
she
looked
at
it
thoughtfully
perhaps
since
she
was
so
very
lonely
for
her
father
he
would
mind
if
she
opened
that
trunk
to
see
what
articles
he
had
handled
last
she
moved
the
lamp
to
a
box
beside
the
trunk
turned
the
key
and
lifted
the
cover
her
father
best
suit
was
there
very
neatly
folded
and
his
shoes
from
under
these
came
a
gleam
of
something
faintly
pink
jeanne
carefully
drew
it
forth
my
old
pink
dress
she
exclaimed
jeanne
slipped
it
on
it
was
much
too
short
why
said
she
what
a
lot
i
grown
upright
in
one
corner
of
the
trunk
jeanne
found
a
green
bottle
it
held
a
withered
stalk
to
which
two
dried
pink
petals
still
clung
i
left
that
bottle
with
a
rose
in
it
on
father
table
when
i
went
away
said
jeanne
he
must
have
found
it
there
when
he
got
back
and
it
and
this
dress
he
did
give
it
to
annie
he
and
i
glad
sometimes
when
i
was
so
awfully
lonesome
at
aunt
agatha
i
used
to
wonder
if
my
father
really
love
me
but
now
i
he
did
every
single
minute
i
put
this
dress
back
where
i
found
it
another
thing
that
came
to
light
was
her
father
bankbook
she
showed
that
the
next
day
to
old
captain
who
studied
it
carefully
i
glad
said
jeanne
that
there
a
little
money
it
may
be
needed
for
mollie
it
was
one
day
early
in
october
mollie
failed
to
waken
from
one
of
her
comfortable
naps
thanks
to
léon
duval
modest
savings
poor
mollie
was
decently
buried
fairchild
took
jeanne
and
old
captain
and
all
the
flowers
from
schmidt
little
greenhouse
to
the
very
simple
funeral
i
got
to
be
a
mother
to
mollie
children
just
as
soon
as
ever
i
can
said
jeanne
on
the
way
home
i
was
going
to
do
it
for
daddy
anyway
but
now
i
want
to
for
mollie
too
chapter
xxiv
mollie
babies
the
following
week
jeanne
and
two
of
the
kittens
went
to
live
with
fairchild
the
other
two
were
to
stay
with
old
captain
who
it
seemed
was
fond
of
kittens
jeanne
was
spared
the
necessity
of
dividing
the
snail
bayard
taylor
had
run
away
as
snails
are
exactly
built
for
running
old
captain
and
barney
considered
this
a
huge
joke
whether
bayard
taylor
crawled
over
the
edge
of
the
dock
and
fell
in
or
whether
one
of
the
playful
kittens
batted
him
overboard
or
whether
he
was
hidden
in
some
crevice
among
the
cinders
nobody
ever
knew
though
diligently
sought
for
the
great
american
traveler
never
turned
up
fairchild
warmly
welcomed
both
jeanne
and
the
kittens
and
declared
that
he
was
delighted
to
have
somebody
to
make
the
table
come
out
even
at
meal
times
with
three
people
said
he
there
always
somebody
left
out
in
the
cold
now
we
can
talk
in
pairs
fairchild
was
like
a
child
with
a
new
toy
jeanne
room
was
newly
decorated
and
even
refurnished
for
her
it
was
the
very
girliest
of
girl
rooms
and
the
windows
overlooked
the
lake
jeanne
was
glad
of
that
it
made
it
seem
like
home
next
her
wardrobe
was
replenished
huntington
had
replenished
jeanne
wardrobe
more
than
once
but
this
was
different
loving
care
went
into
the
selecting
of
every
garment
and
it
made
a
surprising
difference
jeanne
her
new
clothes
her
pretty
yet
suitable
trinkets
for
fairchild
taste
was
better
than
and
she
took
keen
pleasure
in
choosing
shades
and
colors
that
were
becoming
to
jeanne
skin
the
fairchilds
were
delighted
with
her
appearance
roger
proved
a
comfortable
housemate
he
was
a
tease
like
harold
jeanne
neither
liked
nor
disliked
him
she
merely
regarded
him
as
part
of
the
fairchilds
furniture
the
furniture
because
she
saw
him
mostly
at
meals
roger
certainly
liked
to
eat
when
he
discovered
that
the
visitor
showed
no
inclination
to
talk
about
his
undignified
tumble
into
the
lake
he
found
her
presence
rather
agreeable
than
otherwise
with
jeanne
to
consider
his
mother
had
quite
so
much
time
to
fuss
over
he
hated
to
be
fussed
over
moreover
she
look
at
jeanne
and
the
marmalade
at
the
same
time
roger
who
loved
marmalade
was
glad
of
that
one
morning
the
express
wagon
stopped
in
front
of
house
the
delivered
a
large
wooden
box
addressed
to
miss
duval
this
must
be
for
you
jeanne
said
fairchild
why
yes
said
jeanne
eying
the
address
i
suppose
i
miss
duval
i
wonder
who
sent
it
let
look
inside
said
fairchild
we
get
roger
to
open
it
the
box
proved
when
opened
to
contain
every
garment
and
every
article
that
jeanne
had
left
at
the
huntingtons
the
things
had
not
been
nicely
packed
and
were
pretty
well
jumbled
together
i
guess
said
fairchild
shrewdly
they
were
just
in
what
they
anyway
the
clothes
i
left
behind
me
returned
jeanne
who
had
flushed
and
then
paled
at
sight
of
her
belongings
i
guess
i
guess
aunt
agatha
does
want
me
to
go
back
jeanne
did
to
go
back
yet
it
seemed
rather
appalling
to
learn
so
conclusively
that
she
was
expected
her
lips
began
to
quiver
ominously
i
glad
she
does
said
fairchild
with
an
arm
about
jeanne
i
want
you
myself
i
could
of
losing
you
now
you
see
i
wrote
to
her
and
told
her
that
you
were
to
visit
me
and
about
your
father
i
suppose
this
is
her
reply
it
is
exactly
a
gracious
one
i
afraid
i
outgrown
some
of
the
things
but
this
party
dress
was
always
too
long
and
the
petticoats
have
big
tucks
in
them
perhaps
we
can
send
whatever
proves
too
small
to
annie
they
be
too
big
for
a
year
or
two
but
i
like
to
keep
them
for
her
i
glad
of
my
books
anyway
and
daddy
letters
they
safe
in
this
box
suddenly
fairchild
began
to
laugh
softly
jeanne
looked
at
her
in
amazement
jeanne
herself
had
been
rather
close
to
tears
i
feel
said
fairchild
as
if
i
been
unexpectedly
slapped
in
the
face
i
wrote
huntington
such
a
letter
and
now
this
box
at
little
you
aunt
agatha
always
makes
people
feel
slapped
assured
jeanne
brightening
then
i
gladder
than
ever
that
she
does
want
you
i
was
horribly
afraid
she
might
shortly
after
this
old
captain
who
had
sent
the
news
of
mollie
death
to
louis
received
a
letter
from
mollie
brother
captain
blossom
toiled
up
the
hill
to
show
it
to
jeanne
things
were
going
badly
in
john
shannon
family
work
was
slack
and
old
shannon
was
a
great
trial
to
her
who
was
not
very
well
the
children
too
were
very
troublesome
their
new
aunt
it
seemed
had
no
patience
with
brats
they
had
all
been
sick
with
mumps
measles
and
whooping
cough
and
would
just
as
like
as
not
come
down
with
scarlet
fever
and
chicken
pox
both
sammy
and
patsy
seemed
to
be
sickly
anyway
you
see
explained
old
captain
them
children
did
have
no
chance
to
catch
nothin
in
bancroft
out
on
that
there
old
dock
where
nobody
ever
come
with
them
there
germs
no
wonder
they
sick
with
all
them
germs
gettin
to
onct
altogether
it
was
a
depressing
letter
it
confirmed
all
fears
and
presented
her
with
several
new
ones
they
do
even
go
to
school
sighed
jeanne
but
oh
i
wish
they
had
a
nice
aunt
there
must
be
nice
aunts
in
the
world
but
i
sure
is
a
nice
one
i
guess
poor
john
picked
the
wrong
woman
said
old
captain
shrewdly
there
some
that
kind
to
other
people
children
and
some
that
ai
john
seemed
a
kind
sort
of
chap
himself
but
if
his
wife
wa
a
mother
with
real
mother
feelin
why
all
john
kindness
could
make
up
for
her
cussedness
if
she
felt
to
be
cussed
it
too
bad
too
bad
they
was
good
little
shavers
that
there
sammy
now
take
myself
oh
pleaded
jeanne
i
wish
you
take
them
old
captain
shook
his
head
my
heart
big
enough
he
said
but
my
freight
car
ai
but
the
dock
is
said
jeanne
and
there
the
shack
that
shack
no
place
for
children
in
cold
weather
it
too
far
to
school
and
got
to
stay
with
my
fish
besides
i
ai
goin
to
marry
no
lady
whatsoever
to
take
care
of
no
family
of
children
i
a
hum
ladies
present
real
good
cook
and
is
mostly
one
kind
outside
and
another
kind
inside
i
had
one
wife
and
she
give
me
this
jeanne
and
fairchild
looked
with
interest
at
the
furrow
on
the
captain
bald
pate
she
done
it
with
the
dipper
concluded
the
captain
i
sure
i
do
blame
you
said
fairchild
for
your
caution
i
queried
old
captain
who
seemed
to
be
enjoying
the
glass
of
sweet
cider
and
the
plate
of
cookies
that
fairchild
had
offered
him
you
ai
heard
nothin
from
the
huntingtons
well
explained
fairchild
i
wrote
to
huntington
two
weeks
ago
explaining
matters
and
asking
for
news
of
jeanne
grandfather
she
has
been
very
anxious
about
him
you
know
an
she
ai
wrote
well
the
old
jeanne
giggled
she
could
help
it
she
had
so
often
compared
chilly
aunt
agatha
whose
frozen
dignity
had
unpleasantly
impressed
older
persons
than
jeanne
with
the
curious
along
the
lake
shore
in
winter
they
looked
sometimes
precisely
like
smooth
cold
ladies
waiting
for
the
warm
sun
to
come
and
melt
them
aunt
agatha
however
had
not
melted
she
sent
jeanne
clothes
explained
fairchild
but
she
write
evidently
she
is
going
to
let
us
keep
our
nice
girl
jeanne
was
glad
she
was
to
stay
but
those
poor
children
the
more
comfortable
she
was
herself
the
more
she
worried
over
their
possible
discomforts
she
possessed
a
vivid
imagination
and
it
busied
itself
now
with
those
three
poor
babies
if
mollie
had
been
too
lazy
to
properly
wash
and
clothe
her
children
at
least
she
had
cuddled
and
comforted
them
with
her
soft
affectionate
hands
even
cold
huntington
had
not
been
cross
or
ugly
she
had
merely
been
unloving
suppose
in
addition
to
being
unloving
the
new
aunt
were
cross
and
suppose
she
whipped
those
ailing
babies
and
locked
them
up
in
dark
closets
jeanne
worried
about
it
before
she
went
to
sleep
at
night
and
awoke
before
daylight
to
imagine
new
horrors
no
aunt
have
been
as
black
as
jeanne
fancy
finally
painted
that
one
that
child
is
said
fairchild
one
day
in
some
ways
she
is
an
old
little
person
sometimes
she
reproaches
herself
for
having
deserted
her
grandfather
she
fears
he
may
be
missing
her
and
she
is
unhappy
about
those
children
she
thinks
of
them
constantly
and
imagines
dreadful
things
since
that
letter
came
she
has
been
able
to
enjoy
her
meals
for
fear
annie
and
sammy
have
been
sent
supperless
to
bed
i
declare
some
days
i
more
than
half
tempted
to
for
those
children
not
with
my
consent
said
fairchild
firmly
i
am
glad
to
have
jeanne
here
it
a
good
thing
for
both
of
you
and
it
is
doing
roger
any
harm
i
glad
to
feed
and
clothe
and
educate
her
and
to
keep
her
forever
if
necessary
because
she
all
wool
and
a
yard
wide
you
know
what
i
mean
i
like
her
well
enough
to
do
anything
for
her
but
roger
will
have
to
go
to
college
some
day
and
you
know
my
dear
i
am
only
a
moderately
rich
man
i
can
take
good
care
of
you
three
but
that
all
it
would
be
fair
to
roger
to
add
three
more
or
even
two
more
to
this
family
you
see
something
might
happen
to
and
then
where
would
be
with
five
hungry
children
to
support
of
course
you
right
sighed
fairchild
but
jeanne
is
certainly
unhappy
about
those
children
she
must
learn
to
be
contented
without
them
returned
fairchild
she
forget
them
in
time
but
jeanne
was
contented
and
she
could
forget
the
babies
that
had
been
so
much
a
part
of
her
young
life
on
the
dock
still
because
she
was
a
considerate
young
person
she
tried
not
to
talk
about
them
she
even
tried
to
pretend
that
she
was
thinking
of
them
but
fairchild
knew
when
she
caught
the
big
dark
eyes
gazing
off
into
space
that
they
were
seeing
moving
pictures
of
sammy
annie
and
patsy
getting
spanked
by
the
crossest
of
aunts
and
scolded
by
the
ugliest
of
grandmothers
of
course
she
had
written
to
them
from
time
to
time
but
sammy
was
barely
seven
and
probably
write
at
any
rate
no
one
had
answered
her
letters
or
acknowledged
her
small
gifts
chapter
xxv
the
house
of
dreams
letters
for
everybody
said
roger
one
morning
even
for
jeanne
who
gets
any
a
bill
for
you
father
an
invitation
for
you
mother
a
circular
for
me
and
jeanne
gets
the
only
real
letter
in
the
bunch
it
from
chicago
the
fairchilds
were
at
the
breakfast
table
and
everybody
looked
eagerly
at
jeanne
it
must
be
from
the
rossiters
said
she
i
wrote
to
rossiter
ever
so
long
ago
oh
they
been
to
alaska
they
always
travel
a
lot
and
my
letter
followed
them
from
place
to
place
and
they
did
get
it
until
just
the
other
day
but
oh
here
news
of
my
grandfather
read
it
to
you
were
so
sorry
to
hear
through
charles
huntington
that
your
grandfather
is
in
such
a
hopeless
condition
he
has
been
absolutely
helpless
for
the
past
three
months
and
his
mind
is
completely
gone
he
knows
no
one
and
i
am
sure
does
not
miss
you
so
my
dear
you
need
worry
no
longer
about
that
i
doubt
if
he
has
been
well
enough
for
a
single
day
since
you
saw
him
last
to
miss
anybody
i
sorry
my
grandfather
is
like
that
said
jeanne
but
of
course
glad
he
does
miss
me
i
afraid
he
wo
be
able
to
use
the
nice
handkerchief
that
i
embroidering
that
lovely
on
for
christmas
poor
grandfather
he
been
sick
so
long
anyway
said
fairchild
seeking
to
divert
her
annie
will
like
her
doll
yes
said
jeanne
brightening
she
just
love
it
we
never
had
any
christmas
on
the
dock
and
the
huntingtons
had
a
very
one
no
toys
or
trees
or
stockings
i
always
wanted

a
christmas

any
other
of
your
schoolmates
that
you

to
your
tree
there

plenty
of
extra
candy
boxes
and
a
lot
of
little
trinkets
that
will
fit
for
jeanne
had
girl
friends
more
than
that
lucy
father
was
a
carpenter
and
fairchild
did
she
said
he
was
a
carpenter
and
that
lucy
was
a
sweet
girl
and
bessie
lived
in
an
unfashionable
part
of
town
fairchild
did
mind
that
either
nor
the
fact
that
the
girl
father
sold
meat
in
his
corner
grocery
bessie
she
said
was
a
dear
with
a
nice
mother
she
had
taken
pains
to
find
out
jeanne
could
help
remembering
her
experience
with
lizzie
susie
and
aunt
agatha
nor
feeling
that
fairchild
attitude
toward
her
friends
was
much
pleasanter
she
was
having
lunch
with
bessie
one
day
in
november
when
fairchild
brought
home
a
piece
of
news
does
anybody
in
this
house
happen
to
know
the
whereabouts
of
a
young
woman
named
jeannette
huntington
duval
he
asked
when
he
came
in
that
noon
jeanne
she
having
lunch
with
bessie
it
bessie
birthday
good
and
roger
gone
to
ishpeming
for
the
ball
game
good
again
i
have
something
to
tell
you
a
very
young
lawyer
from
pennsylvania
was
directed
to
my
office
this
morning
in
his
search
for
the
missing
heir
to
a
very
respectable
fortune
what
you
mean
demanded
fairchild
whose
heir
whose
fortune
jeanne
grandfather
died
nearly
two
weeks
ago
returned
fairchild
although
he
is
known
to
have
made
a
will
many
years
ago
leaving
all
his
money
to
his
son
charles
no
such
will
has
been
found
among
his
effects
he
kept
it
in
his
own
possession
unless
it
turns
up
and
you
can
believe
me
the
huntingtons
have
made
a
pretty
thorough
search
his
very
considerable
estate
will
be
equally
divided
between
his
son
charles
and
jeanne
jeanne
it
is
practically
certain
that
the
will
no
longer
exists
i
do
hope
it
does
since
huntington
was
so
horrid
to
jeanne
so
do
i
you
must
tell
jeanne
about
her
grandfather
i
suppose
but
it
will
be
wiser
not
to
mention
the
money
until
we
are
certainly
glad
we
adopted
her
this
happened
i
have
consented
to
adopt
an
heiress
nor
i
said
fairchild
i
think
i
almost
rather
have
her
it
such
fun
to
give
her
things
well
she
be
if
that
will
turns
up
be
sure
you
do
tell
her
i
wo
promised
fairchild
i
hate
to
have
her
disappointed
that
afternoon
the
good
little
woman
broke
the
news
of
death
to
jeanne
who
took
it
very
calmly
poor
grandfather
she
said
i
do
believe
he
being
dead
as
long
as
he
could
get
well
but
uncle
charles
was
always
very
kind
to
him
in
what
way
why
he
gave
him
a
comfortable
home
and
that
nice
james
to
take
care
of
him
and
a
trained
nurse
when
he
needed
one
aunt
agatha
said
that
trained
nurses
cost
a
great
deal
i
guess
uncle
charles
is
glad
now
that
he
gave
his
father
everything
he
needed
so
jeanne
had
not
known
that
the
money
had
belonged
to
her
grandfather
or
that
the
house
that
huntington
always
called
my
house
had
also
belonged
to
the
old
man
she
had
loved
him
for
himself
fairchild
was
glad
of
that
but
she
found
keeping
the
secret
of
jeanne
possible
fortune
a
very
great
trial
you
edward
she
complained
to
her
husband
i
never
keep
a
secret
do
write
to
that
lawyer
man
and
find
out
for
certain
still
she
it
but
she
could
resist
playing
around
the
troublesome
burden
what
would
you
buy
she
asked
the
first
time
she
was
alone
with
jeanne
if
you
had
oodles
and
oodles
and
oodles
of
money
an
automobile
a
diamond
ring
a
pet
monkey
or
all
three
how
big
is
an
oodle
asked
jeanne
cautiously
that
too
much
for
me
laughed
fairchild
but
suppose
you
had
a
million
or
enough
so
you
always
have
plenty
for
whatever
you
happened
to
feel
like
doing
would
you
travel
yes
said
jeanne
to
louis
to
get
those
children
sometimes
i
make
up
a
sort
of
a
story
about
that
when
i
ca
go
to
sleep
i
find
a
great
big
chest
full
of
money
on
the
cinder
pond
beach
and
then
i
spend
it
how
well
first
i
go
after
those
children
and
then
i
buy
the
cinder
pond
and
build
a
lovely
big
house
like
this
on
the
green
hillside
back
of
it
across
the
road
you
know
from
where
we
go
down
to
the
dock
and
of
course
i
always
buy
the
dock
and
the
pond
for
sort
of
an
extra
front
yard
then
i
have
a
comfortable
big
automobile
with
a
very
chauffeur
to
take
the
children
to
and
from
school
and
a
rented
mother
a
a
nice
person
to
keep
house
and
tell
the
cook
a
very
good
one
like
bridget
what
to
give
us
for
meals
i
always
have
a
nice
supper
ready
for
old
captain
ready
on
his
table
to
surprise
him
when
he
comes
home
at
night
that
is
in
summer
in
winter
he
lives
with
us
of
course
i
having
the
children
educated
so
they
can
earn
their
own
living
when
they
grow
up
because
i
might
want
to
be
married
some
day
i
decided
to
wait
though
until
i
about
because
it
so
much
fun
to
be
just
a
girl
i
have
sammy
learn
to
be
a
discoverer
i
think
because
he
so
inquisitive
and
maybe
annie
can
sing
in
a
choir
she
has
a
little
voice
and
patsy
loves
grasshoppers
i
do
know
just
what
he
do
perhaps
he
make
a
good
naturalist
a
professor
of
zoölogy
laughed
fairchild
but
you
left
out
oh
no
i
have
you
my
fairy
godmother
and
my
very
best
friend
you
always
help
me
buy
clothes
for
the
children
and
pick
out
wallpapers
and
rugs
and
things
you
always
have
times
in
my
house
i
certainly
have
the
time
of
my
life
agreed
fairchild
if
your
were
real
well
sighed
jeanne
it
is
in
the
daytime
i
only
two
dollars
left
in
my
pincushion
i
guess
that
would
raise
a
very
large
family
and
there
is
any
way
for
a
chest
of
gold
to
be
washed
up
on
the
cinder
pond
beach
because
no
ship
could
get
inside
the
pond
unless
it
climbed
right
over
the
dock
and
of
course
without
that
chest
the
rest
of
the
dream
would
work
i
tried
to
move
the
chest
to
the
beach
but
some
way
it
does
fit
that
one
other
people
might
see
it
there
and
find
it
first
yes
agreed
fairchild
the
chest
is
certainly
the
most
necessary
part
of
that
dream
but
i
fear
old
captain
is
the
only
golden
treasure
the
cinder
pond
has
for
us
i
like
him
better
every
time
i
see
him
chapter
xxvi
a
padlocked
door
huntington
lawyers
assured
fairchild
who
had
written
to
find
out
more
definitely
about
the
settling
of
huntington
estate
that
there
was
practically
no
doubt
that
jeannette
huntington
duval
being
her
mother
sole
heir
would
inherit
half
of
her
grandfather
large
fortune
safely
invested
in
a
long
list
of
things
as
soon
as
certain
formalities
had
been
observed
further
search
had
revealed
no
trace
of
the
lost
document
undoubtedly
huntington
had
destroyed
it
perhaps
if
jeanne
had
known
that
aunt
agatha
was
all
but
tearing
the
old
house
to
pieces
in
hopes
of
finding
a
certain
very
valuable
document
she
have
remembered
that
unusual
day
in
march
when
she
had
helped
her
grandfather
clean
house
in
his
safe
but
happily
for
her
peace
of
mind
she
knew
too
little
of
legal
matters
to
connect
the
burned
trash
with
the
fact
that
somehow
or
other
half
of
the
huntington
fortune
was
hers
no
one
happened
to
mention
any
missing
document
fairchild
however
was
still
keeping
the
secret
of
possible
fortune
from
everybody
but
his
wife
he
was
cautious
and
wanted
to
be
absolutely
certain
i
shall
declared
fairchild
earnestly
if
i
have
to
keep
it
much
longer
think
of
breaking
news
to
jeanne
she
had
so
little
one
day
fairchild
went
alone
to
pay
a
visit
to
old
captain
she
returned
fairly
beaming
i
invited
him
to
our
christmas
tree
said
she
he
willing
to
be
santa
claus
barney
coming
too
three
days
before
christmas
jeanne
obeyed
a
sudden
impulse
to
call
on
old
captain
she
had
purchased
a
pipe
for
barney
and
wanted
to
be
sure
that
it
was
just
exactly
right
old
captain
would
know
it
was
saturday
old
captain
would
surely
be
home
tidying
his
freight
car
and
heating
water
for
his
weekly
shave
but
where
old
captain
the
door
of
the
was
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
before
locked
from
the
outside
too
there
was
a
padlock
i
guess
he
doing
his
christmas
shopping
said
jeanne
or
perhaps
he
it
and
is
afraid
somebody
steal
my
present
i
wonder
if
it
a
pink
parasol
or
some
pink
silk
stockings
dear
old
captain
he
thinks
pink
is
my
color
and
the
it
is
the
better
he
likes
it
i
do
believe
i
buy
him
a
pink
necktie
but
no
he
it
besides
i
have
that
nice
muffler
for
him
well
it
pretty
cold
around
here
and
i
hate
to
freeze
to
this
bench
and
there
no
knowing
when
he
get
back
maybe
fairchild
knows
about
pipes
so
jeanne
trudged
homeward
but
not
you
may
be
sure
without
a
searching
glance
at
the
beach
where
the
should
have
been
but
was
we
going
to
have
our
tree
christmas
eve
said
fairchild
that
evening
when
the
family
sat
before
the
cheerful
grate
fire
that
jeanne
considered
much
pleasanter
than
a
gas
log
but
we
wo
take
anything
off
the
tree
itself
until
christmas
night
on
christmas
eve
we
open
just
the
bundles
we
find
the
tree
that
make
our
christmas
last
twice
as
long
oh
i
excited
jeanne
you
are
as
young
as
i
am
roger
you
stolid
boy
you
sedate
old
gentleman
why
do
you
get
up
more
enthusiasm
i
always
get
all
the
things
i
want
and
some
said
roger
lazily
so
why
worry
you
a
spoiled
child
laughed
jeanne
fairchild
however
seemed
to
wear
an
air
of
pleased
expectancy
quite
different
from
roger
calmness
having
a
daughter
to
liven
things
up
said
fairchild
is
a
new
experience
for
us
you
can
see
how
well
it
agrees
with
us
both
i
hope
jeanne
you
giving
me
a
pipe
just
like
barney
nobody
gave
me
one
like
that
i
awfully
sorry
said
jeanne
but
i
have
the
price
that
pipe
cost
cents
and
i
have
that
much
in
all
the
world
have
to
wait
till
my
kindergarten
salary
begins
fairchild
looked
at
his
wife
touched
his
breast
pocket
where
a
paper
rustled
threw
back
his
head
and
how
perfectly
delicious
exclaimed
fairchild
then
merry
laugh
rang
out
what
the
joke
asked
jeanne
can
see
it
roger
no
i
ca
they
just
havin
fun
with
us
but
if
eleven
cents
would
help
you
any
roger
clothes
fitted
so
snugly
that
it
was
rather
a
difficult
task
to
extract
the
eleven
pennies
from
his
pocket
but
he
fished
them
out
one
by
one
there
as
your
captain
would
say
yourn
i
hope
you
wo
be
reckless
with
because
they
all
i
got
except
a
quarter
you
ca
have
that
why
said
jeanne
who
had
been
counting
on
her
fingers
this
makes
just
enough
i
cents
i
wonder
what
uncle
charles
would
have
done
if
i
bought
a
pipe
he
always
smoked
cigarettes
a
smelly
kind
that
i
did
like
i
would
have
he
have
been
polite
but
he
would
have
looked
at
the
pipe
as
if
as
if
it
were
a
snail
in
his
coffee
oh
jeanne
protested
fairchild
what
a
horrid
thought
it
now
when
can
i
buy
that
other
pipe
not
tomorrow
because
of
that
school
entertainment
that
last
until
dark
not
the
next
day
morning
very
late
the
day
before
christmas
decided
fairchild
quickly
i
take
you
downtown
in
the
car
then
you
can
take
your
parcels
to
bessie
and
lucy
and
invite
them
to
the
christmas
night
part
of
the
tree
while
i
doing
a
few
errands
remember
christmas
not
christmas
eve
when
the
time
came
to
do
this
final
shopping
jeanne
was
left
alone
to
select
the
pipe
and
to
go
on
foot
first
to
lucy
then
to
bessie
fairchild
was
to
call
for
her
at
bessie
i
may
be
late
said
she
but
no
matter
how
long
it
is
i
want
you
to
wait
for
the
car
it
be
dark
by
that
time
the
days
are
so
short
you
telephoned
bessie
that
you
were
coming
yes
she
surely
be
home
then
that
all
right
be
sure
to
wait
for
the
car
dear
have
a
good
time
jeanne
paused
for
a
moment
to
gaze
thoughtfully
after
the
departing
lady
she
looks
nice
she
sounds
nice
and
she
nice
said
jeanne
i
suppose
aunt
agatha
had
to
stay
the
way
she
was
made
but
as
long
as
there
so
of
her
it
seems
a
pity
they
left
out
such
a
lot
perhaps
they
make
folks
the
way
they
do
plum
puddings
and
do
always
get
the
fruit
in
maybe
they
forgot
aunt
agatha
raisins
and
most
of
the
sugar
and
put
extra
ones
in
fairchild
maybe
i
ought
to
try
to
like
aunt
agatha
better
i
glad
i
made
her
a
anyway
if
it
happens
that
she
is
to
blame
for
having
any
raisins
but
it
nice
not
to
have
to
to
like
fairchild
have
to
try
to
the
shops
were
very
and
all
the
shoppers
seemed
excited
and
happy
and
busy
there
were
parcels
under
all
the
arms
or
else
there
were
baskets
filled
with
christmas
dinners
jeanne
loved
it
all
the
christmas
feel
in
the
air
the
christmas
shine
in
the
faces
unconsciously
she
loitered
along
the
busy
street
after
the
pipe
was
purchased
thinking
all
sorts
of
quaint
thoughts
if
my
father
and
my
grandfather
are
in
the
same
part
of
heaven
said
she
i
sure
they
must
be
friends
by
now
because
they
both
loved
me
and
my
mother
they
have
of
things
to
talk
about
perhaps
they
can
see
me
now
perhaps
they
glad
that
my
heart
is
full
of
christmas
i
they
must
be
thankful
for
fairchild
but
if
mollie
can
see
children
oh
i
fairchild
got
their
box
off
in
time
and
i
do
hope
that
new
aunt
has
christmas
in
her
heart
all
these
people
with
bundles
are
just
with
christmas
jeanne
of
course
was
far
from
suspecting
that
her
own
bright
little
face
was
so
radiant
with
the
holiday
spirit
that
many
a
person
paused
for
a
second
glance
chapter
xxvii
the
pink
present
although
jeanne
loitered
outside
shop
windows
and
kept
a
sharp
lookout
for
old
captain
who
be
shopping
for
pink
parasols
although
she
lingered
at
lucy
and
stayed
and
stayed
and
at
bessie
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
taking
fairchild
a
very
great
while
to
come
with
the
promised
car
it
was
that
lady
husband
who
came
with
it
finally
come
on
sister
said
he
when
jeanne
appeared
on
the
doorstep
that
other
child
is
still
finding
things
to
put
on
that
tree
roger
asked
jeanne
no
indeed
fairchild
our
youngest
these
days
so
i
had
to
come
for
you
hop
in
it
pretty
cold
for
the
engine
did
you
buy
that
pipe
good
we
stop
for
some
tobacco
shall
i
get
you
some
for
barney
he
coming
to
the
tree
too
is
he
that
good
if
his
pipe
draws
better
than
mine
i
take
it
away
from
him
now
you
cuddle
under
the
rugs
and
i
stop
for
the
there
were
other
errands
after
that
in
spite
of
cheerful
conversation
concerning
these
various
errands
it
seemed
to
jeanne
that
the
fastest
little
car
in
bancroft
was
very
slow
about
getting
home
that
evening
they
arrived
in
time
for
dinner
fairchild
met
them
at
the
front
door
do
waste
a
minute
said
she
fairly
dragging
them
inside
on
the
table
your
soup
getting
cold
you
can
wash
your
hands
in
the
downstairs
lavatory
jeanne
no
time
to
go
upstairs
mother
so
excited
that
her
hair
coming
down
observed
roger
at
the
table
and
she
so
mysterious
that
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
if
she
had
a
young
elephant
or
a
horse
hidden
upstairs
in
the
closet
look
at
her
eyes
i
feel
confessed
fairchild
who
had
never
looked
prettier
than
she
did
at
that
moment
as
if
i
were
jumping
right
out
of
my
skin
i
eat
my
soup
or
did
mary
take
it
away
roger
roared
oh
mumsey
he
said
you
younger
than
i
was
at
if
you
had
girls
to
fix
a
tree
for
you
starve
you
have
touched
your
steak
what
that
noise
this
house
is
full
of
strange
sounds
as
if
santa
claus
were
stuck
fast
in
our
chimney
shall
i
fairchild
hopped
up
ran
to
the
front
hall
and
slipped
a
record
into
the
phonograph
a
record
and
the
machine
wide
open
why
mumsey
said
roger
as
the
clattering
music
filled
the
room
i
thought
you
hated
that
record
i
did
look
said
fairchild
to
see
what
it
was
but
admit
taking
it
from
the
noisy
pile
a
few
moments
later
roger
pushed
his
chair
back
please
excuse
me
said
he
i
do
like
the
dessert
we
going
to
have
tonight
no
sit
still
pleaded
his
mother
hastily
put
on
another
record
that
nice
one
on
top
of
the
pile
and
then
come
back
to
your
place
i
see
laughed
roger
you
trying
to
drown
the
noises
my
giraffe
is
making
upstairs
he
obeyed
however
and
presently
everybody
tapioca
pudding
was
eaten
now
good
people
said
fairchild
rising
from
her
chair
going
to
slip
into
the
parlor
for
one
moment
to
switch
on
the
lights
and
to
make
sure
that
wait
here
everybody
until
i
come
for
you
of
all
the
kids
declared
roger
my
mother
the
one
it
my
first
christmas
said
jeanne
why
just
excited
over
and
my
first
tree
come
said
fairchild
appearing
in
the
parlor
doorway
you
first
jeanne
with
fairchild
fingers
over
her
eyes
jeanne
was
propelled
across
the
hall
into
the
big
best
room
now
said
fairchild
stepping
back
jeanne
looked
the
tall
tree
was
ablaze
with
electric
lights
and
glittering
ornaments
captain
blossom
stood
at
one
side
of
it
and
barney
at
the
other
both
were
grinning
broadly
jeanne
dazzled
eyes
traveled
from
the
top
of
the
tree
to
the
beaming
faces
beside
it
and
then
to
a
point
not
very
far
above
the
floor
where
the
light
shimmered
upon
three
balls
of
reddish
carroty
gold
and
three
pairs
of
bright
expectant
eyes
shrieked
jeanne
darting
forward
are
you
oh
you
darling
babies
it
was
true
there
they
were
dirty
ragged
and
rather
frightened
especially
patsy
who
could
understand
what
was
happening
captain
blossom
and
barney
have
been
keeping
them
quiet
in
the
attic
explained
fairchild
the
captain
went
to
louis
to
get
them
and
got
to
bancroft
with
them
this
morning
they
been
fed
but
all
they
have
even
had
a
bath
i
wanted
you
to
have
the
pleasure
of
doing
annie
is
to
sleep
with
you
and
the
two
boys
are
to
have
the
nursery
there
are
for
them
and
a
little
underwear
but
you
are
to
have
the
fun
of
buying
all
the
rest
there
are
toys
under
the
bed
and
your
box
for
them
is
there
too
why
we
are
having
celebrations
i
keep
those
children
hidden
a
moment
longer
how
do
you
like
your
presents
jeanne
her
arms
full
of
children
turned
slowly
to
face
the
fairchilds
tears
were
sparkling
on
her
eyelashes
but
her
eyes
were
big
and
bright
she
said
you
have
also
a
little
gift
from
your
grandfather
said
fairchild
showing
jeanne
a
folded
paper
and
then
returning
it
to
his
pocket
for
i
read
this
to
you
sometime
when
you
not
so
busy
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
your
grandfather
has
left
you
enough
money
to
buy
cinder
ponds
build
a
small
orphan
asylum
and
feed
and
educate
at
least
half
a
dozen
small
children
said
jeanne
using
the
only
word
she
seemed
to
have
left
santa
claus
seems
to
be
making
up
for
lost
time
said
roger
who
had
caught
his
mother
wiping
away
happy
tears
and
had
feared
for
one
dreadful
moment
that
he
himself
was
going
to
shed
a
couple
he
never
gave
three
children
and
a
fortune
all
at
one
whack
and
what
i
heard
upstairs
was
even
a
goat
never
mind
said
jeanne
with
her
little
twisty
smile
i
you
one
then
she
went
swiftly
to
fairchild
put
her
arms
about
that
little
lady
waist
and
laid
her
cheek
against
hers
are
my
nicest
christmas
present
she
said
i
just
love
you
the
end
a
month
later
did
you
ever
read
the
words
the
end
and
then
turn
over
the
pages
at
the
back
of
the
book
to
see
if
there
was
just
the
least
scrap
more
hidden
this
time
there
is
everybody
knows
that
you
are
quite
clever
enough
to
guess
everything
that
happened
afterwards
to
jeanne
and
her
family
but
old
captain
wants
you
to
know
for
certain
that
annie
was
perfectly
sweet
and
lovely
in
her
new
clothes
that
sammy
was
so
bright
and
attractive
in
his
that
the
teacher
just
loved
him
and
gave
him
a
splendid
start
along
the
road
to
knowledge
and
that
patsy
proved
so
good
and
so
charming
in
every
way
that
fairchild
fairly
adored
him
and
this
is
the
very
end
