yasmini
song
chapter
i
a
watery
july
sun
was
hurrying
toward
a
punjab
as
if
weary
of
squandering
his
strength
on
men
who
did
not
mind
and
resentful
of
the
unexplainable
a
the
cold
steel
and
khaki
of
native
indian
cavalry
at
attention
gleamed
motionless
between
british
infantry
and
two
batteries
of
horse
artillery
the
only
noticeable
sound
was
the
voice
of
a
general
officer
that
rose
and
fell
explaining
and
asserting
pride
in
his
command
but
saying
nothing
as
to
the
why
of
exercises
in
the
mud
nor
did
he
mention
why
the
censorship
was
in
full
force
he
did
not
say
a
word
of
germany
or
belgium
in
front
of
the
third
squadron
from
the
right
ranjoor
singh
sat
his
charger
like
a
big
bronze
statue
he
would
have
stooped
to
see
his
right
spur
bettor
that
shone
in
spite
of
mud
for
though
he
has
been
a
man
these
years
ranjoor
singh
has
neither
lost
his
boyhood
love
of
such
things
nor
intends
to
he
has
been
accused
of
wearing
solid
silver
spurs
in
bed
but
it
hurt
him
to
bend
much
after
a
day
hard
exercise
on
a
horse
such
as
he
rode
once
in
a
gully
where
the
whistling
himalayan
wind
was
acting
a
young
surgeon
had
taken
hurried
stitches
over
ranjoor
singh
ribs
without
probing
deep
enough
for
an
afghan
bullet
that
bullet
burned
after
a
long
day
in
the
saddle
and
bagh
was
as
the
big
brute
name
implied
a
tiger
of
a
horse
unweakened
even
by
monsoon
weather
and
his
habit
was
to
spring
with
terrific
suddenness
when
his
rider
moved
on
him
so
ranjoor
singh
sat
still
he
was
willing
to
eat
agony
at
any
time
for
the
squadron
sake
for
a
squadron
of
outram
own
is
a
unity
to
marvel
at
or
envy
and
its
leader
a
man
to
be
forgiven
spurs
a
longer
than
the
regulation
as
a
soldier
however
he
was
careful
of
himself
when
occasion
offered
he
preferred
bagh
to
all
other
horses
in
the
world
because
it
had
needed
persuasion
much
stroking
of
a
black
beard
to
hide
anxiety
and
many
a
secret
to
sweat
the
savagery
before
the
could
be
made
to
see
his
virtues
as
a
charger
and
accept
him
into
the
regiment
he
loved
all
things
that
expressed
in
any
way
his
own
unconquerable
fire
most
of
all
however
he
loved
the
squadron
there
was
no
woman
nor
anything
between
him
and
d
squadron
but
bagh
came
next
spurs
were
not
needed
when
the
general
ceased
speaking
and
the
british
colonel
of
outram
own
shouted
an
order
bagh
brute
energy
beneath
hair
and
plastered
dirt
sprang
like
a
loosed
and
his
rider
lips
drew
tight
over
clenched
teeth
as
he
mastered
self
agony
and
horse
in
one
man
effort
fight
how
he
would
heel
tooth
and
eye
all
flashing
bagh
was
forced
to
hold
his
rightful
place
in
front
of
the
squadron
precisely
the
right
distance
behind
the
last
supernumerary
of
the
squadron
next
in
front
line
after
rippling
line
all
sikhs
of
the
true
sikh
baptism
except
for
the
eight
of
their
officers
who
were
european
outram
own
swept
down
a
living
avenue
of
british
troops
and
neither
gunners
nor
infantry
could
see
one
flaw
in
them
although
picking
flaws
in
native
regiments
is
almost
part
of
the
british
army
officer
religion
to
the
blare
of
military
music
through
a
bog
of
their
own
mixing
the
sikhs
trotted
for
a
mile
then
drew
into
a
walk
to
bring
the
horses
into
barracks
cool
enough
for
watering
they
reached
stables
as
the
sun
dipped
under
the
acacia
trees
and
while
the
troopers
scraped
and
rubbed
the
mud
from
weary
horses
banjoor
singh
went
through
a
task
whose
form
at
least
was
part
of
his
very
life
he
could
imagine
nothing
less
than
death
or
active
service
that
could
keep
him
from
inspecting
every
horse
in
the
squadron
before
he
ate
or
drank
or
as
much
as
washed
himself
but
although
the
day
had
been
a
hard
one
and
the
strain
on
the
horses
more
than
ordinary
his
examination
now
was
so
perfunctory
that
the
squadron
gaped
the
troopers
signaled
with
their
eyes
as
he
passed
little
more
than
glancing
at
each
horse
almost
before
his
back
had
vanished
at
the
stable
entrance
wonderment
burst
into
words
for
the
third
time
he
does
thus
see
my
beast
overreached
and
he
passed
without
detecting
it
does
the
sun
set
the
same
way
still
i
have
noticed
that
he
does
thus
each
time
after
a
what
is
the
connection
a
in
the
rains
a
general
officer
talking
to
us
afterward
about
the
salt
as
if
a
sikh
does
not
understand
the
salt
better
than
a
british
general
knows
english
and
our
neglecting
the
horses
is
there
a
connection
aye
what
is
all
this
we
worked
no
harder
in
the
war
against
the
chitralis
there
is
something
in
my
bones
that
speaks
of
war
when
i
listen
for
a
while
war
hear
him
brothers
talk
is
talk
but
there
will
be
no
war
until
india
grows
too
fat
to
breathe
unless
the
past
be
remembered
and
we
make
one
for
ourselves
there
was
silence
for
a
while
if
a
change
of
sounds
is
silence
the
delhi
mud
sticks
as
tight
as
any
and
the
kneading
of
it
from
out
of
horsehair
taxes
most
of
a
trooper
energy
and
full
attention
then
the
east
being
the
east
in
all
things
a
solitary
trooper
picked
up
the
scent
and
gave
tongue
as
a
true
hound
guides
the
pack
who
is
he
wondered
loud
enough
for
fifty
men
to
hear
from
out
of
a
cloud
of
where
a
stable
helper
on
probation
combed
a
tangled
tail
came
one
word
of
swift
enlightenment
yasmini
in
a
second
the
whole
squadron
was
by
the
ears
and
the
was
the
center
of
an
interest
he
had
not
bargained
for
nay
sahibs
i
but
followed
him
and
how
should
i
know
nay
then
i
did
not
follow
him
it
so
happened
i
took
that
road
and
he
stepped
out
of
a
at
her
door
am
i
blind
do
i
not
know
her
door
does
not
everybody
know
it
who
am
i
that
i
should
know
why
he
goes
again
but
does
a
moth
fly
only
once
to
the
does
a
drunkard
drink
but
once
by
the
guru
nay
may
my
tongue
parch
in
my
throat
if
i
said
he
is
a
drunkard
i
said
i
meant
to
say
seeing
she
is
yasmini
and
he
having
been
to
see
her
once
and
being
again
in
a
great
hurry
whither
goes
he
so
the
squadron
chose
a
of
inquiry
seven
strong
that
being
a
lucky
number
the
wide
world
over
and
the
movements
of
the
were
reported
one
by
one
to
the
squadron
with
the
infinite
exactness
of
small
detail
that
seems
so
useless
to
all
save
easterns
fifteen
minutes
after
he
had
left
his
quarters
no
longer
in
khaki
uniform
but
dressed
as
a
sikh
gentleman
the
whole
squadron
knew
the
color
of
his
undershirt
also
that
he
had
hired
a
and
that
his
only
weapon
was
the
ornamental
dagger
that
a
true
sikh
wears
twisted
in
his
hair
one
after
one
five
other
men
reported
him
nearly
all
the
way
through
delhi
through
the
chandni
chowk
where
the
last
man
but
one
nearly
lost
him
in
the
evening
crowd
to
the
narrow
place
where
with
a
bend
in
the
street
to
either
hand
is
yasmini
the
last
man
watched
him
through
yasmini
outer
door
and
up
the
lower
stairs
before
hurrying
back
to
the
squadron
and
a
little
later
on
being
almost
as
inquisitive
as
they
were
careful
for
their
major
the
squadron
delegated
other
men
in
mufti
to
watch
for
him
at
the
foot
of
yasmini
stairs
or
as
near
to
the
foot
as
might
be
and
see
him
safely
home
again
if
they
had
to
fight
all
asia
on
the
way
these
men
had
some
money
with
them
and
weapons
hidden
underneath
their
clothes
for
having
betted
largely
on
the
at
stables
the
squadron
was
in
funds
in
case
of
trouble
one
can
bribe
the
police
counseled
nanak
singh
and
he
surely
ought
to
know
for
he
was
the
oldest
trooper
and
trouble
everlasting
had
preserved
him
from
promotion
but
weapons
are
good
when
policemen
are
not
looking
he
added
and
the
squadron
agreed
with
him
it
was
tej
singh
not
given
to
talking
as
is
rule
who
voiced
the
general
opinion
now
we
are
on
the
track
of
things
now
perhaps
we
shall
know
the
meaning
of
field
exercises
during
the
monsoon
with
our
horses
up
to
the
belly
in
blue
mud
the
winds
of
all
the
world
blow
into
and
out
again
our
knows
nothing
at
all
of
women
and
that
is
the
danger
but
he
can
listen
to
the
wind
and
what
he
hears
sooner
or
later
we
shall
know
too
i
smell
happenings
those
three
words
comprised
the
whole
of
it
the
squadron
spent
most
of
the
night
whispering
dissecting
analyzing
subdividing
weighing
guessing
at
that
smell
of
happenings
while
its
thinking
his
secret
all
his
own
investigated
nearer
to
its
source
have
you
heard
the
dry
earth
shrug
herself
for
a
storm
that
tore
the
trees
have
you
watched
faithful
praising
allah
on
their
knees
have
you
felt
the
short
hairs
rising
when
the
moon
slipped
out
of
sight
and
the
chink
of
steel
on
rock
explained
that
footfall
in
the
night
have
you
seen
a
gray
boar
sniff
in
the
mauve
of
waking
day
have
you
heard
a
mad
crowd
pause
and
think
have
you
seen
all
hell
to
pay
chapter
ii
yasmini
bears
a
reputation
that
includes
her
gift
for
dancing
and
her
skill
in
song
but
is
not
bounded
thereby
her
stairs
illustrated
it
the
two
flights
of
steep
winding
stairs
that
lead
to
her
bewildering
they
seem
to
have
been
designed
to
take
men
breath
away
and
to
deliver
them
at
the
top
defenseless
but
ranjoor
singh
mounted
them
with
scarcely
an
effort
as
a
man
who
could
master
bagh
well
might
and
at
the
top
his
back
was
straight
and
his
eye
clear
the
cunning
curtained
lights
did
not
distract
him
so
he
did
not
make
the
usual
mistake
of
thinking
that
the
loveliness
who
met
him
was
yasmini
yasmini
likes
to
make
her
first
impression
of
the
evening
on
a
man
just
as
he
comes
from
making
an
idiot
of
himself
so
the
maid
who
curtsies
in
the
maze
of
mirrored
lights
has
been
trained
to
imitate
her
but
ranjoor
singh
flipped
the
girl
a
coin
and
it
jingled
at
her
feet
the
maid
ceased
bowing
too
insulted
to
retort
the
piece
of
silver
she
would
have
stooped
for
gold
just
as
surely
as
she
would
have
recognized
its
ring
lay
where
it
fell
ranjoor
singh
stepped
forward
toward
a
curtain
through
which
a
soft
light
shone
and
an
unexpected
low
laugh
greeted
him
it
was
merry
mocking
musical
and
something
more
there
was
wisdom
hidden
in
it
masquerading
as
frivolity
somewhere
too
there
was
that
she
who
laughed
knew
all
about
and
found
more
interesting
than
a
play
then
suddenly
the
curtain
parted
and
yasmini
blocked
the
way
standing
with
arms
spread
wide
to
either
smiling
at
him
and
ranjoor
singh
had
to
stop
and
stare
whether
it
suited
him
or
not
yasmini
is
not
old
nor
nearly
old
for
all
that
india
is
full
of
tales
about
her
from
the
himalayas
to
cape
comorin
in
a
land
where
twelve
is
a
marriageable
age
a
woman
need
not
live
to
thirty
to
be
talked
about
and
if
she
can
dance
as
yasmini
does
though
only
the
russian
ballet
can
do
that
she
has
the
secret
of
perpetual
youth
to
help
her
defy
the
years
no
doubt
the
soft
light
favored
her
but
she
might
have
been
ranjoor
singh
granddaughter
as
she
barred
his
way
and
looked
him
up
and
down
impudently
through
languorous
brown
eyes
salaam
o
plowman
she
mocked
she
was
not
actually
still
an
instant
for
the
light
played
incessantly
on
her
gauzy
silken
trousers
and
jeweled
slippers
but
she
made
no
move
to
admit
him
my
honor
grows
twice
nay
three
times
in
a
little
while
she
spoke
in
the
jat
tongue
fluently
but
that
was
not
remarkable
because
yasmini
is
mistress
of
so
many
languages
that
men
say
one
can
not
speak
in
her
hearing
and
not
be
understood
i
am
a
soldier
answered
ranjoor
singh
more
than
a
little
stiffly
am
a
statesman
said
the
viceroy
babu
a
sikh
is
a
jat
farmer
with
a
lion
tail
and
the
manners
of
a
buffalo
age
or
gallantry
will
bend
a
man
back
what
keeps
it
straight
the
smell
of
the
farmyard
on
his
shoes
ranjoor
singh
did
not
answer
nor
did
he
bow
low
as
she
intended
she
forgot
perhaps
that
on
a
previous
occasion
he
had
seen
her
snatch
a
man
turban
from
his
head
and
run
with
it
into
the
room
to
the
sweating
shame
he
kicked
his
shoes
off
calmly
and
waited
as
a
man
waits
on
parade
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
that
were
like
dark
jewels
only
no
jewels
in
the
world
ever
glowed
so
wonderfully
he
thought
he
could
read
anger
in
them
but
that
ruffled
him
no
more
than
her
mockery
enter
then
o
farmer
she
said
turning
lithely
as
a
snake
to
beckon
him
and
lead
the
way
now
he
had
only
a
back
view
of
her
but
the
contour
of
her
neck
and
chin
and
her
shoulders
mocked
him
just
as
surely
as
her
lips
were
making
signals
that
he
could
not
see
one
answer
to
the
signals
was
the
tittering
of
twenty
maids
who
sat
together
by
the
great
deep
window
ready
to
make
music
they
laugh
to
see
a
farmer
strayed
from
his
purred
yasmini
over
her
shoulder
but
ranjoor
singh
followed
her
unperturbed
he
was
finding
time
to
study
the
long
room
its
divans
and
deep
cushions
around
the
walls
and
it
did
not
escape
his
notice
that
many
people
were
expected
he
guessed
there
was
room
for
thirty
or
forty
to
sit
at
ease
like
a
pale
blue
a
glitter
in
the
cunning
lights
she
led
him
to
a
far
end
of
the
room
where
many
cushions
were
there
she
turned
on
him
with
a
suddenness
that
was
one
of
her
surest
tricks
i
shall
have
great
guests
i
shall
be
busy
that
is
thy
affair
said
ranjoor
singh
aware
that
her
eyes
were
seeking
to
read
his
soul
the
dropped
lids
did
not
deceive
him
then
what
do
you
want
here
that
question
was
sheer
impudence
it
is
very
well
understood
in
delhi
that
any
native
gentleman
of
rank
may
call
on
yasmini
between
midday
and
midnight
without
offering
a
reason
for
his
visit
otherwise
it
would
be
impossible
to
hold
a
salon
and
be
a
power
in
politics
in
a
land
where
politics
run
deep
but
where
men
do
not
admit
openly
to
which
party
they
belong
but
yasmini
represents
the
spirit
of
the
old
east
sweeter
than
a
rose
and
twice
as
tempting
with
a
poisoned
thorn
inside
and
here
was
the
new
east
in
the
shape
of
a
sikh
officer
taught
by
young
england
he
annoyed
her
ranjoor
singh
answer
was
to
seat
himself
with
a
dignity
the
west
has
yet
to
learn
on
a
long
divan
against
the
wall
that
gave
him
a
good
view
of
the
entrance
and
all
the
rest
of
the
room
window
included
instantly
yasmini
flung
herself
on
the
other
end
of
it
and
lay
face
downward
with
her
chin
resting
on
both
hands
she
studied
his
face
intently
for
sixty
seconds
and
it
very
seldom
takes
her
that
long
to
read
a
man
character
guess
at
his
past
and
make
arrangements
for
his
future
if
she
thinks
him
worth
her
while
why
are
you
here
she
asked
again
at
the
end
of
her
scrutiny
ranjoor
singh
seemed
not
to
hear
her
he
was
watching
other
men
who
entered
and
listening
to
the
sound
of
yet
others
on
the
stairs
no
other
sikh
came
in
nor
more
than
one
of
any
other
caste
or
tribe
yet
he
counted
thirty
men
in
half
as
many
minutes
i
think
you
are
a
buffalo
she
said
at
last
but
if
ranjoor
singh
was
interested
in
her
thoughts
he
forgot
to
admit
it
a
dozen
more
men
entered
and
the
air
already
heavy
grew
thick
with
tobacco
smoke
mingling
with
the
smoke
of
that
floated
back
and
forth
in
layers
as
the
punkahs
swung
lazily
outside
the
rain
swished
and
chilled
the
night
air
but
the
hot
air
from
inside
hurried
out
to
meet
the
cool
and
none
of
the
cool
came
in
the
noise
of
rain
became
depressing
until
yasmini
made
a
signal
to
her
maids
and
they
started
to
make
music
then
yasmini
caught
a
new
sound
on
the
stairs
and
swiftly
instantly
instead
of
glancing
to
the
entrance
her
eyes
sought
ranjoor
singh
and
she
saw
that
he
had
heard
it
too
so
she
sat
up
as
if
enlightenment
had
come
and
had
brought
disillusion
in
its
wake
the
curtain
jingled
and
a
maid
backed
through
it
giggling
followed
in
a
hurry
by
a
european
dressed
in
a
white
duck
apology
for
evening
clothes
he
seemed
a
little
the
worse
for
drink
but
not
too
drunk
to
recognize
the
real
yasmini
when
he
saw
her
and
to
blush
crimson
for
having
acted
like
an
idiot
queen
of
the
night
he
said
in
hindustani
that
was
peculiarly
mispronounced
she
answered
under
her
breath
but
she
smiled
at
him
and
aloud
she
said
will
the
sahib
honor
us
all
by
being
seated
a
maid
took
charge
of
the
man
at
once
and
led
him
to
a
seat
not
far
from
the
middle
of
the
room
yasmini
whose
eyes
were
on
ranjoor
singh
every
other
second
noticed
that
the
sikh
having
summed
up
the
european
had
already
lost
all
interest
but
there
were
other
footsteps
the
curtain
parted
again
to
admit
a
second
european
a
somewhat
older
man
who
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
deferentially
and
to
yasmini
unerring
eye
tried
to
carry
off
prudish
timidity
with
an
air
of
knowingness
who
is
he
demanded
ranjoor
singh
and
yasmini
rattled
the
bracelets
on
her
ankles
loud
enough
to
hide
a
whisper
an
agent
she
answered
he
has
an
office
here
in
delhi
the
first
man
is
his
clerk
who
is
supposed
to
be
the
leader
into
mischief
they
have
made
him
a
little
drunk
lest
he
understand
too
much
i
have
sent
a
maid
to
him
that
he
may
understand
even
less
the
second
man
was
closely
followed
by
a
third
and
yasmini
smothered
a
squeal
of
excitement
for
she
saw
that
ranjoor
singh
eyes
were
ablaze
at
last
and
that
he
had
sat
bolt
upright
without
knowing
it
the
third
man
was
dressed
like
the
other
two
in
white
duck
but
he
wore
his
clothes
not
as
they
did
he
was
tall
and
straight
one
could
easily
enough
imagine
him
dressed
better
his
quick
intelligent
gray
eyes
swept
over
the
whole
room
while
he
took
two
steps
and
at
once
picked
out
yasmini
as
the
mistress
of
the
place
but
he
waited
to
bow
to
her
until
the
first
man
pointed
her
out
then
it
seemed
to
ranjoor
singh
who
was
watching
as
minutely
as
yasmini
in
turn
watched
him
that
when
he
bowed
this
tall
individual
almost
clicked
his
heels
together
but
remembered
not
to
do
so
just
in
time
the
eyes
of
the
east
miss
no
small
details
yasmini
letting
her
jeweled
ankles
jingle
again
chuckled
to
ranjoor
singh
and
they
say
he
comes
from
europe
selling
goods
she
whispered
the
fat
man
who
is
frightened
claims
to
be
a
customer
for
bales
of
blankets
since
when
has
the
customer
been
humble
while
the
seller
calls
the
tune
look
the
second
arrival
and
the
third
sat
down
together
as
she
spoke
and
while
the
second
sat
like
a
merchant
nursing
fat
hands
on
a
consequential
paunch
the
third
sat
kicking
a
little
sidewise
with
his
left
leg
ranjoor
singh
saw
too
that
he
kept
his
heels
a
little
more
than
a
spur
length
off
from
the
divan
drapery
listen
hissed
ranjoor
singh
yasmini
wriggled
closer
and
pretended
to
be
watching
her
maids
over
by
the
window
that
man
who
came
last
said
the
has
been
told
that
thou
art
like
a
spider
watching
from
the
middle
of
the
web
of
india
then
for
once
they
have
told
the
truth
she
chuckled
in
the
bazaar
he
asked
to
be
shown
men
of
all
the
tribes
that
he
might
study
their
commercial
needs
he
was
told
to
come
here
and
meet
them
and
these
were
sent
for
from
the
caravanserais
is
it
not
so
art
thou
thyself
for
the
raj
asked
yasmini
i
lead
a
squadron
of
sikh
cavalry
said
ranjoor
singh
and
you
ask
me
am
i
for
the
raj
the
buffalo
that
carries
water
for
the
office
lawn
is
for
the
raj
said
yasmini
then
he
and
i
are
brothers
and
he
yonder
what
of
him
she
was
growing
impatient
for
the
tune
was
nearly
at
an
end
and
it
would
be
time
presently
for
her
to
take
up
the
burden
of
entertainment
he
will
ask
perhaps
to
speak
with
a
sikh
of
influence
sahib
hear
is
to
obey
she
mocked
rising
to
her
feet
listen
yet
commanded
ranjoor
singh
serve
me
in
this
matter
and
there
will
be
great
reward
i
who
am
only
one
might
die
by
a
dagger
or
a
rope
in
the
dark
or
ground
glass
in
my
bread
but
then
there
would
be
a
squadron
and
perhaps
a
regiment
to
ask
questions
perhaps
perhaps
who
knows
he
spoke
from
modesty
sure
of
the
squadron
that
he
loved
so
much
better
than
his
life
but
not
caring
to
magnify
his
own
importance
by
claiming
the
regard
of
the
other
squadrons
too
but
yasmini
who
never
in
her
life
went
straight
from
point
to
point
of
an
idea
and
never
could
believe
that
anybody
else
did
supposed
he
meant
that
one
squadron
was
in
his
confidence
whereas
the
rest
had
not
yet
been
sounded
so
speaks
one
who
is
for
the
raj
she
grinned
playing
for
profit
and
amusement
she
never
never
let
anybody
know
which
side
she
had
taken
in
any
game
therefore
she
despised
a
man
who
showed
his
hand
to
her
as
she
believed
ranjoor
singh
had
done
but
she
only
showed
contempt
when
it
suited
her
and
by
no
means
always
when
she
felt
it
the
minor
music
ceased
and
all
eyes
in
the
room
were
turned
to
her
she
rose
to
her
feet
as
a
hooded
cobra
comes
toward
its
prey
sparing
a
sidewise
surreptitious
smile
of
confidence
for
ranjoor
singh
that
no
eye
caught
save
his
yet
as
she
turned
from
him
and
swayed
in
the
first
few
steps
of
a
dance
devised
that
minute
his
quick
ear
caught
the
truth
of
her
opinion
buffalo
she
murmured
the
flutes
in
the
window
wailed
about
mystery
the
lights
and
the
and
the
expectant
silence
emphasized
it
step
by
step
as
if
the
spirit
of
all
dancing
had
its
home
in
her
she
told
a
wordless
tale
using
her
feet
and
every
sinuous
muscle
as
no
other
woman
in
all
india
ever
did
men
say
that
yasmini
is
partly
russian
and
that
may
be
true
for
she
speaks
russian
fluently
russian
or
not
the
members
of
the
russian
ballet
are
the
only
others
in
the
world
who
share
her
art
certainly
she
keeps
in
touch
with
russia
and
knows
more
even
than
the
indian
government
about
what
goes
on
beyond
india
northern
frontier
she
makes
and
magnifies
the
whole
into
a
mystery
and
her
dance
that
night
expressed
the
fascination
mystery
has
for
her
and
then
she
sang
it
is
her
added
gift
of
song
that
makes
yasmini
unique
for
she
can
sing
in
any
of
a
dozen
languages
and
besides
the
that
come
southward
from
the
hills
she
knows
all
the
interminable
ballads
of
the
south
and
the
central
provinces
but
when
as
that
evening
she
is
at
her
best
mixing
magic
under
the
eyes
of
the
inquisitive
she
sings
songs
of
her
own
making
and
only
very
rarely
the
same
song
twice
she
sang
that
night
of
the
winds
of
the
world
which
she
claims
carry
the
news
to
her
although
others
say
her
sources
of
information
speak
more
distinctly
it
seemed
that
the
thread
of
an
idea
ran
through
song
and
dance
alike
and
that
the
hillmen
and
who
sat
and
watched
could
follow
the
meaning
of
it
they
began
to
crowd
closer
to
squat
on
the
floor
in
circles
one
outside
the
other
until
the
european
three
became
the
center
of
three
rings
of
men
who
stared
at
them
with
owls
solemnity
then
yasmini
ceased
dancing
then
one
of
the
europeans
drew
his
watch
out
and
he
had
to
show
it
to
the
other
two
before
he
could
convince
them
that
they
had
sat
for
two
hours
without
wanting
to
do
anything
but
watch
and
listen
so
said
one
of
them
the
drunken
du
lieber
gott
schon
halb
zwolf
said
the
second
the
third
man
made
no
remark
at
all
he
was
watching
ranjoor
singh
the
risaldar
major
had
left
the
divan
by
the
end
wall
and
walked
all
grim
straight
lines
in
contrast
to
yasmini
curves
to
a
spot
directly
facing
the
three
europeans
and
it
seemed
there
sat
a
hillman
on
the
piece
of
floor
he
coveted
get
up
he
commanded
make
room
the
hillman
did
not
budge
for
an
afridi
pretends
to
feel
for
a
sikh
the
scorn
that
a
sikh
feels
truly
for
afridis
the
flat
of
ranjoor
singh
foot
came
to
his
assistance
and
the
hillman
budged
in
an
instant
he
was
on
his
feet
with
a
lightning
right
hand
reaching
for
his
knife
but
yasmini
allows
no
butcher
work
on
her
premises
and
her
words
within
those
walls
are
law
since
no
man
knows
who
is
on
whose
side
yasmini
beckoned
him
and
the
afridi
slouched
toward
her
sullenly
she
whispered
something
and
he
started
for
the
stairs
at
once
without
any
further
protest
then
there
vanished
all
doubt
as
to
which
of
the
three
europeans
was
most
important
the
man
who
had
come
in
first
had
accepted
sherbet
from
the
maid
who
sat
beside
him
he
went
suddenly
from
drowsiness
to
slumber
and
the
woman
spurned
his
away
from
her
shoulder
letting
him
fall
like
a
log
among
the
cushions
the
stout
second
man
looked
frightened
and
sat
nursing
helpless
hands
but
the
third
man
sat
forward
and
tense
silence
fell
on
the
assembly
as
the
eyes
of
every
man
sought
his
only
yasmini
hovering
in
the
background
had
time
to
watch
anything
other
than
those
gray
european
eyes
she
saw
that
they
were
interested
most
in
ranjoor
singh
and
the
maids
who
noticed
her
expression
of
sweet
innocence
knew
that
she
was
thinking
fast
you
are
a
sikh
said
the
man
and
the
crowd
drew
in
its
breath
for
he
spoke
hindustani
with
an
accent
that
very
few
achieve
even
with
long
practise
then
you
are
of
a
brave
nation
you
will
understand
me
the
sikhs
are
a
martial
race
their
theory
of
politics
is
based
on
the
military
spirit
is
it
not
so
ranjoor
singh
who
understood
and
tried
to
live
the
sikh
religion
with
all
his
gentlemanly
might
was
there
to
acquire
information
not
to
impart
it
he
grunted
gravely
all
martial
nations
expand
eventually
they
tell
me
i
have
heard
some
of
you
sikhs
have
tried
canada
ranjoor
singh
did
not
wince
though
his
back
stiffened
when
the
men
around
him
grinned
it
is
a
sore
point
with
the
sikhs
that
canada
does
not
accept
their
emigrants
sikhs
are
admitted
into
all
the
german
colonies
said
the
man
with
the
gray
eyes
they
are
welcome
do
many
go
asked
ranjoor
singh
that
is
the
point
the
sikhs
want
a
place
in
the
sun
from
which
they
are
barred
at
present
eh
now
germany
germany
where
is
germany
asked
yasmini
she
understands
the
last
trick
in
the
art
of
getting
a
story
on
its
way
to
the
west
is
england
farther
west
ameliki
to
the
north
lies
russia
to
the
south
the
where
is
germany
the
man
with
the
gray
eyes
took
her
literally
since
his
nation
are
not
slow
at
seizing
opportunity
he
launched
without
a
word
more
of
preliminary
into
a
lecture
on
germany
that
lasted
hours
and
held
his
audience
spellbound
it
was
colorful
complete
and
it
did
not
seem
to
have
been
memorized
but
that
was
art
he
had
no
word
of
blame
for
england
he
even
had
praise
when
praise
made
german
virtue
seem
by
that
much
greater
and
the
inference
from
first
to
last
was
of
german
some
one
in
the
crowd
who
bore
a
in
proof
he
did
not
jest
suggested
to
him
that
the
british
army
was
the
biggest
and
fiercest
in
the
world
so
he
told
them
of
a
german
army
millions
strong
that
marched
in
league
long
columns
an
army
that
guarded
by
the
prosperous
hundred
thousand
factory
chimneys
that
smoked
until
the
central
european
sky
was
black
long
long
after
midnight
in
a
final
burst
of
imagination
he
likened
germany
to
a
bee
hive
from
which
a
swarm
must
soon
emerge
for
lack
of
room
inside
and
he
proved
then
that
he
knew
he
had
made
an
impression
on
them
for
he
dismissed
them
with
an
impudence
that
would
have
set
them
laughing
at
him
when
he
first
began
to
speak
ye
have
my
leave
to
go
he
said
as
if
he
owned
the
place
and
they
all
went
except
one
that
is
a
lot
of
talk
said
ranjoor
singh
when
the
last
man
had
started
for
the
stairs
what
does
it
amount
to
when
will
the
bees
swarm
the
german
eyed
him
keenly
but
the
sikh
eyes
did
not
flinch
what
is
your
rank
the
german
asked
squadron
leader
oh
the
two
stood
up
and
now
there
was
no
mistake
about
the
heels
they
clicked
the
two
were
almost
of
a
height
although
the
sikh
head
dress
made
him
seem
the
taller
they
were
both
unusually
fine
looking
men
and
limb
for
limb
they
matched
if
war
were
in
europe
you
would
be
taken
there
to
fight
said
the
german
ranjoor
singh
showed
no
surprise
whether
you
wanted
to
fight
or
not
there
was
no
hint
of
laughter
in
the
sikh
brown
eyes
germany
has
no
quarrel
with
the
sikhs
i
have
heard
of
none
said
ranjoor
singh
wherever
the
german
flag
should
fly
after
a
war
the
sikhs
would
have
free
footing
ranjoor
singh
looked
interested
even
pleased
who
is
not
against
germany
is
for
her
let
us
have
plain
words
said
ranjoor
singh
leading
the
way
to
a
corner
in
which
he
judged
they
could
not
be
overheard
there
he
turned
suddenly
borrowing
a
trick
from
yasmini
i
am
a
sikh
a
patriot
what
are
you
offering
the
freedom
of
the
earth
the
german
answered
self
government
the
right
to
emigrate
liberty
on
what
condition
for
a
bargain
has
two
sides
that
the
sikhs
fail
england
when
when
the
time
comes
what
is
the
answer
i
will
answer
when
the
time
comes
answered
ranjoor
singh
saluting
stiffly
before
turning
on
his
heel
then
he
stalked
out
of
the
room
with
a
slight
bow
to
yasmini
as
he
passed
buffalo
she
murmured
after
him
jat
buffalo
then
the
germans
went
away
after
some
heavy
compliments
that
seemed
to
amuse
yasmini
prodigiously
helping
along
the
man
who
had
drunk
sherbet
and
who
now
seemed
inclined
to
weep
they
dragged
him
down
the
stairs
between
them
backward
yasmini
waited
at
the
stair
head
until
she
heard
them
pull
him
into
a
and
drive
away
then
she
turned
to
her
favorite
maid
them
those
cattle
i
understand
she
said
but
it
does
not
suit
me
that
a
sikh
a
jat
a
buffalo
should
come
here
making
mysteries
of
his
own
without
consulting
me
and
what
does
not
suit
me
i
do
not
tolerate
go
get
that
afridi
whom
the
soldier
kicked
i
told
him
to
wait
outside
in
the
street
until
i
sent
for
him
the
afridi
came
nearly
as
helpless
as
the
man
who
had
drunk
sherbet
though
less
tearful
and
almost
infinitely
more
resentful
what
clothing
had
not
been
torn
from
him
was
soaked
in
blood
and
there
was
no
inch
of
him
that
was
not
bruised
krishna
said
yasmini
impiously
allah
swore
the
afridi
who
did
it
what
has
happened
outside
in
the
street
i
said
to
some
men
who
waited
that
ranjoor
singh
the
sikh
is
a
bastard
from
then
until
now
they
beat
me
only
leaving
off
to
follow
him
hence
when
he
came
out
through
the
door
yasmini
laughed
peal
upon
peal
of
silver
laughter
of
sheer
merriment
the
gods
love
yasmini
she
chuckled
aye
the
gods
love
me
the
jat
spoke
of
a
squadron
it
is
evident
that
he
spoke
truth
so
his
squadron
watched
him
here
go
go
wash
the
blood
away
thou
shalt
have
revenge
come
again
to
morrow
nay
go
now
i
would
sleep
when
i
have
finished
laughing
aye
the
gods
love
yasmini
the
west
wind
blows
through
the
ajmere
gate
and
whispers
low
oh
listen
ye
the
fed
wolf
curls
by
his
drowsy
mate
in
a
tight
trod
earth
but
the
lean
wolves
wait
and
the
hunger
gnaws
oh
listen
ye
can
fed
wolves
fight
but
their
eyes
were
bright
their
fangs
were
clean
they
viewed
they
took
but
oh
listen
wise
heads
listen
ye
because
they
fed
is
blood
less
red
or
fangs
less
sharp
or
hunger
dead
look
well
to
the
loot
and
listen
ye

song
chapter
iii
the
colonel
of
outram
own
dropped
into
a
club
where
he
was
only
one
and
not
the
greatest
of
many
men
entitled
to
respect
there
were
three
men
talking
by
a
window
their
voices
drowned
by
the
din
of
rain
on
the
veranda
roof
each
of
whom
nodded
to
him
he
chose
however
a
solitary
chair
for
though
subalterns
do
not
believe
it
a
colonel
has
exactly
that
diffidence
about
approaching
senior
civilians
which
a
subaltern
ought
to
feel
in
a
moment
all
that
was
visible
of
him
from
the
door
was
a
pair
of
brown
very
much
resting
on
the
long
arm
of
a
cane
chair
and
two
sets
of
wonderfully
modeled
fingers
that
held
up
a
newspaper
from
the
window
where
the
three
men
talked
he
could
be
seen
in
profile
wears
well
does
he
said
one
of
them
swears
well
too
confound
him
hah
been
trying
to
pump
him
eh
yes
he
like
a
big
bird
catching
flies
picks
off
your
questions
one
at
a
time
with
one
eye
on
you
and
the
other
one
cocked
for
the
next
question
get
nothing
out
of
him
but
yes
or
no
good
fellow
though
when
you
not
drawing
him
you
mean
trying
to
draw
him
he
the
best
that
come
wish
they
were
all
like
kirby
the
man
who
had
not
spoken
yet
he
looked
younger
was
some
years
older
and
watched
the
faces
of
the
other
two
while
seeming
to
listen
to
something
in
the
distance
looked
at
a
cheap
watch
nervously
wish
the
sikhs
were
all
like
kirby
he
said
if
this
business
comes
to
a
head
we
going
to
wish
we
had
a
million
kirbys
what
did
he
say
temper
of
his
men
excellent
i
suppose
used
that
one
word
no
suspicions
eh
said
no
suspicions
uh
i
have
a
word
with
him
he
waddled
off
shaking
his
drab
silk
suit
into
shape
and
twisting
a
leather
around
his
finger
believe
it
will
come
to
anything
asked
one
of
the
two
men
he
had
left
behind
dunno
hope
not
awful
business
if
it
does
remember
how
we
were
promised
a
two
years
ago
just
before
the
balkans
took
fire
yes
that
was
a
near
thing
too
but
they
were
quite
ready
then
now
they
are
ready
and
they
think
we
not
if
i
were
asked
i
say
we
ought
to
let
them
know
we
ready
for
they
want
to
fight
because
they
think
they
can
catch
us
napping
they
think
twice
if
they
knew
they
could
do
it
are
they
blind
and
deaf
ca
they
see
and
hear
deus
vult
perdere
prius
ponsonby
my
boy
the
man
in
drab
silk
slipped
into
a
chair
next
to
kirby
as
a
wolf
slips
into
his
lair
very
circumspectly
and
without
noise
then
he
rutched
the
chair
sidewise
toward
kirby
with
about
as
much
noise
as
a
company
of
infantry
would
make
had
a
drink
he
asked
as
kirby
looked
up
from
his
paper
have
one
ginger
ale
please
said
kirby
putting
the
paper
down
a
turbaned
waiter
brought
long
glasses
in
which
ice
tinkled
and
the
two
sipped
slowly
not
looking
at
each
other
know
yasmini
asked
the
man
in
drab
silk
suddenly
heard
of
her
of
course
ever
see
her
no
ah
most
extraordinary
woman
wonderful
kirby
looked
puzzled
and
held
his
peace
any
of
your
officers
ever
visit
her
not
when
they
supposed
to
be
on
duty
but
at
other
times
none
of
my
affair
if
they
do
do
know
i
sure
yes
said
kirby
without
vehemence
look
at
his
beak
said
one
of
the
two
men
by
the
window
never
see
a
big
bird
act
that
way
look
at
his
bright
eye
wish
mine
were
as
bright
and
my
beak
as
aquiline
means
directness
soldierly
directness
that
does
who
is
your
best
native
officer
supposing
you
any
choice
asked
the
man
in
the
drab
silk
suit
speaking
to
the
ceiling
apparently
ranjoor
singh
said
kirby
promptly
it
was
quite
clear
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
how
is
he
best
in
what
way
best
man
i
got
fit
to
command
the
regiment
yes
said
kirby
the
man
in
drab
sat
sidewise
and
caught
kirby
eye
which
was
not
difficult
there
was
nothing
furtive
about
him
with
a
censorship
that
is
admitted
but
which
has
been
rather
obvious
for
more
than
a
month
with
all
forces
undergoing
field
training
during
the
worst
of
the
rains
it
fair
to
suppose
your
men
smell
something
they
been
sweating
certainly
do
they
smell
a
rat
yes
ask
questions
yes
what
do
you
tell
them
that
i
do
know
and
they
must
wait
until
i
do
any
recent
efforts
been
made
to
tamper
with
them
not
more
than
i
reported
you
know
of
course
of
the
translations
from
canadian
papers
discussing
the
rejection
of
sikh
immigrants
each
man
received
a
copy
through
the
mail
yes
we
caught
the
crowd
who
printed
that
could
discover
though
how
it
got
into
the
regiment
mail
bags
without
being
postmarked
let
see
was
ranjoor
singh
yes
would
it
surprise
you
to
know
that
ranjoor
singh
visits
yasmini
would
interest
me
what
follows
is
in
strict
confidence
please
i
listening
i
want
you
to
hear
reason
india
the
whole
of
india
mind
has
its
ear
to
the
ground
all
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
land
in
every
bazaar
in
the
ranks
of
every
native
regiment
it
known
that
people
representing
some
other
european
power
are
trying
to
sow
discontent
with
our
rule
and
it
obvious
to
any
native
that
we
on
the
watch
for
something
big
that
we
expect
to
break
any
minute
is
that
clear
yes
our
strongest
card
is
the
loyalty
of
the
native
troops
yes
everybody
knows
that
also
this
thing
we
looking
for
is
most
damnably
real
might
burst
any
time
so
even
with
the
censorship
in
working
order
it
would
be
wise
to
arrest
a
native
officer
merely
on
suspicion
i
arrest
one
of
mine
said
kirby
if
i
had
any
reason
to
suspect
him
for
a
second
would
be
wise
you
must
the
man
in
drab
silk
shook
his
head
now
suppose
you
were
to
arrest
ranjoor
singh
kirby
laughed
outright
suppose
the
chandni
chowk
were
regent
street
he
jeered
last
night
said
the
man
in
drab
silk
ranjoor
singh
visited
yasmini
leaving
six
or
more
of
the
men
of
his
squadron
waiting
for
him
in
the
street
outside
in
yasmini
room
he
listened
for
hours
to
a
lecture
on
germany
delivered
by
a
german
who
has
british
naturalization
papers
whether
forged
or
not
is
not
yet
clear
after
the
lecture
he
had
a
private
conversation
lasting
some
minutes
with
the
german
who
says
he
is
an
englishman
and
who
by
the
way
speaks
hindustani
like
a
native
and
before
he
started
home
his
men
who
waited
in
the
street
thrashed
an
afridi
within
an
inch
of
his
life
for
threatening
to
report
ranjoor
singh
presence
at
the
lecture
to
the
authorities
who
told
you
this
asked
colonel
kirby
the
afridi
yasmini
and
three
hillmen
who
were
there
by
invitation
i
spoke
with
them
all
less
than
an
hour
ago
they
all
agree
but
if
ranjoor
singh
were
asked
about
it
he
would
lie
himself
out
of
it
in
any
of
a
dozen
ways
and
would
be
on
his
guard
in
future
if
he
were
arrested
it
would
bring
to
a
head
what
may
prove
to
be
a
passing
trifle
it
would
make
the
men
angry
and
the
news
would
spread
whatever
we
might
do
to
prevent
it
what
am
i
to
understand
that
you
want
then
asked
kirby
watch
him
closely
without
letting
him
suspect
it
before
i
seriously
consider
orders
to
do
that
they
have
to
come
through
military
channels
in
the
regular
way
said
kirby
without
emotion
i
could
arrange
that
of
course
i
mention
it
to
todhunter
and
if
the
order
reached
me
in
the
regular
way
i
resign
rather
than
carry
it
out
said
the
man
in
drab
silk
yes
said
kirby
you
seem
to
forget
that
i
too
represent
a
government
department
and
have
the
country
interests
at
heart
do
you
imagine
i
have
a
grudge
against
ranjoor
singh
i
forget
nothing
of
the
kind
said
kirby
and
imagination
enter
into
it
i
know
ranjoor
singh
and
that
enough
if
he
a
traitor
so
am
i
if
he
not
a
loyal
gallant
officer
then
i
not
either
i
stand
or
fall
by
his
honor
for
i
know
the
man
and
you
do
uh
said
the
man
in
drab
silk
yes
said
colonel
kirby
look
said
one
of
the
two
men
at
the
window
direct
as
a
sting
is
a
kink
in
him
look
at
the
angle
of
his
chin
you
can
tell
his
sikh
officers
they
imitate
him
do
i
understand
you
to
refuse
me
point
blank
asked
the
man
in
the
drab
suit
still
fidgeting
with
his
watch
guard
perhaps
he
guessed
that
two
men
in
the
window
were
discussing
him
yes
said
kirby
i
shall
have
to
go
over
your
head
understand
me
then
if
an
order
of
that
kind
reaches
me
i
shall
arrest
ranjoor
singh
at
once
so
that
he
may
stand
trial
and
be
cleared
like
a
gentleman
i
have
nothing
done
to
one
of
my
officers
that
would
be
intolerable
if
done
to
me
so
long
as
i
command
the
regiment
what
alternative
do
you
suggest
asked
the
man
in
gray
with
a
wry
face
ask
ranjoor
singh
about
it
who
you
or
i
he
would
answer
you
then
ask
him
yourself
but
i
shall
remember
colonel
kirby
that
you
did
not
oblige
me
in
the
matter
very
well
said
kirby
another
drink
no
thanks
who
won
asked
one
of
the
two
men
in
the
window
kirby
i
do
think
so
i
been
watching
his
face
he
the
least
bit
rattled
it
somebody
else
who
has
won
he
been
fighting
another
man
battle
but
it
obvious
who
lost
look
at
that
going
come
away
a
man
has
a
price
at
all
his
price
is
neither
high
nor
low
but
just
that
price
that
you
will
pay
native
proverb
chapter
iv
of
course
an
afridi
can
be
depended
on
to
overdo
anything
the
particular
afridi
whom
ranjoor
singh
had
kicked
was
able
to
see
very
little
virtue
in
yasmin
method
of
attack
suckled
in
a
where
vengeance
is
believed
as
real
and
worthy
as
love
must
be
transitory
his
very
bowels
ached
for
physical
retaliation
just
as
his
skin
and
bones
smarted
from
the
beating
the
men
had
given
him
he
was
scoffed
at
by
small
boys
as
he
slunk
through
byways
of
the
big
bazaar
a
woman
who
had
smiled
at
him
but
a
day
ago
now
emptied
unseemly
things
on
him
from
an
upper
story
when
he
went
to
moan
beneath
her
window
he
decided
to
include
that
woman
in
his
vengeance
too
if
possible
but
not
to
miss
ranjoor
singh
on
her
account
there
was
not
room
for
him
and
ranjoor
singh
on
one
earth
but
if
needs
must
the
woman
might
wait
a
while
as
nearly
all
humans
do
when
their
mood
is
similar
to
his
he
slunk
into
dark
places
growling
like
a
dog
and
believing
all
the
world
his
enemy
he
came
very
near
to
the
summit
of
exasperation
when
on
making
application
at
a
free
dispensary
his
sores
were
dressed
for
him
by
a
hindu
assistant
apothecary
who
lectured
him
on
brotherly
love
with
interlarded
excerpts
from
carlyle
done
into
hindustani
but
the
climax
came
when
a
native
policeman
poked
him
in
the
ribs
with
a
truncheon
and
ordered
him
out
of
sight
with
a
snarl
that
would
have
done
credit
to
a
panther
driven
off
its
prey
he
slunk
up
a
byway
to
shelter
himself
and
think
of
new
obscenities
and
as
he
stood
beneath
a
cloth
awning
to
await
the
passing
of
a
more
than
usually
heavy
downpour
the
rotten
fibers
burst
at
last
and
let
ten
gallons
of
filthy
rain
down
on
him
from
that
minute
he
could
see
only
red
so
it
was
in
a
red
haze
that
two
of
the
troopers
from
ranjoor
singh
squadron
passed
the
end
of
the
lane
he
felt
himself
clutching
at
a
red
knife
breathing
red
air
through
distended
nostrils
he
forgot
his
sores
forgot
to
feel
them
as
he
hunted
the
two
troopers
through
the
maze
of
streets
he
recognized
them
for
two
of
the
men
who
had
thrashed
him
so
he
drew
closer
for
fear
they
might
escape
him
in
the
crowd
now
that
he
no
longer
wandered
objectless
but
looked
ahead
and
walked
with
a
will
and
a
purpose
constabeels
ceased
to
trouble
him
there
were
too
many
people
in
those
thronged
kaleidoscopic
streets
for
any
but
the
loafers
to
be
noticed
he
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
troopers
all
unsuspected
but
the
pace
was
fast
and
they
approached
their
barracks
where
his
chance
of
ramming
a
knife
into
them
and
getting
away
unseen
would
be
increasingly
more
remote
and
he
had
no
desire
to
die
until
he
had
killed
the
other
four
men
ranjoor
singh
himself
and
the
woman
who
had
spurned
his
love
he
must
kill
these
two
he
decided
while
yet
safe
from
barrack
hue
and
cry
he
crept
yet
closer
and
now
that
his
plan
was
forming
in
his
to
see
less
red
in
a
minute
more
he
recognized
a
house
at
a
street
corner
whose
lower
story
once
had
been
a
shop
but
that
now
was
boarded
up
and
showed
from
outside
little
sign
of
occupation
but
he
saw
that
the
door
at
the
end
of
an
alley
by
the
building
was
ajar
and
through
a
chink
between
the
shutters
of
an
upper
story
his
keen
northern
eyes
detected
that
was
enough
he
set
his
teeth
and
drew
his
long
clean
knife
wounds
bruises
pain
all
mean
nothing
to
a
hillman
when
there
is
murder
in
his
eye
unless
they
be
spurs
that
goad
him
to
greater
frenzy
and
more
speed
the
troopers
swaggered
at
a
drilled
man
marching
pace
the
afridi
came
like
a
wind
devil
ripping
down
a
gully
from
the
northern
hills
all
frenzy
had
he
not
seen
red
again
had
only
a
little
brain
work
mingled
in
his
rage
he
would
have
scored
a
clean
victory
and
have
been
free
to
wreak
red
vengeance
on
the
rest
as
it
was
rage
mastered
him
and
he
yelled
as
he
drove
the
long
knife
home
between
the
shoulders
of
one
of
the
troopers
in
front
of
him
that
yell
was
a
mistake
for
he
was
dealing
with
picked
drilled
men
of
birth
and
a
certain
education
the
struck
man
sank
to
his
knees
but
the
other
turned
in
time
to
guard
the
next
blow
with
his
forearm
he
seized
a
good
fistful
of
the
afridi
bandages
and
landed
hard
on
his
naked
foot
with
the
heel
of
an
ammunition
boot
the
afridi
screamed
like
a
wild
beast
as
he
wrenched
himself
away
leaving
the
bandages
in
the
trooper
hand
and
for
an
instant
the
trooper
half
turned
to
succor
his
comrade
nay
after
him
urged
the
wounded
man
in
the
jat
tongue
and
seeing
a
crowd
come
running
from
four
directions
the
sikh
let
him
lie
to
race
after
the
afridi
he
caught
little
more
than
a
glimpse
of
torn
clothes
disappearing
through
the
little
door
at
the
end
of
the
alley
by
the
boarded
shop
and
a
second
after
he
had
started
in
pursuit
he
saw
the
door
shut
with
a
slam
and
thought
he
heard
a
bolt
snick
home
the
door
though
small
looked
stout
and
thinking
as
he
charged
to
the
assault
the
sikh
put
all
the
advantage
he
had
of
weight
and
boots
and
strength
and
speed
into
the
effort
a
yard
from
the
door
he
took
off
as
a
man
does
at
the
broad
jump
in
the
sports
landing
against
the
lower
panel
with
his
heels
two
feet
from
the
bottom
the
door
went
inward
as
if
struck
by
a
blast
of
dynamite
and
the
sikh
head
struck
a
flagstone
long
strong
arms
seized
him
by
the
feet
and
dragged
him
inside
then
the
door
closed
again
and
this
time
a
bolt
really
did
shoot
home
to
be
followed
by
two
others
and
a
bar
that
fitted
vertically
into
the
beam
above
and
the
floor
beneath
outside
thirty
feet
from
the
street
corner
the
crowd
came
together
as
a
meets
amid
the
rocks
roaring
shouting
surging
swaying
back
and
forth
questioning
at
the
limit
of
its
lungs
and
yelling
information
that
was
false
before
they
had
it
those
at
the
back
believed
already
that
there
were
ten
men
down
in
the
next
street
there
was
supposed
to
be
a
riot
and
the
shrill
repeated
whistle
of
the
nearest
policeman
summoning
help
confirmed
the
crowd
in
its
belief
besides
convincing
it
of
new
atrocities
as
yet
unguessed
only
one
man
in
the
crowd
had
wit
enough
to
carry
the
tale
to
barracks
where
it
might
be
expected
to
produce
action
he
was
a
bengali
babu
bare
of
leg
and
fat
of
paunch
who
had
enough
imagination
to
conceive
of
a
regiment
in
receipt
of
the
news
and
the
mental
picture
so
appealed
to
him
that
he
held
his
protruding
stomach
in
both
hands
while
he
ran
like
a
landslide
his
mouth
agape
and
his
eyes
all
but
popping
from
his
head
he
reached
the
barrack
gate
speechless
and
breathless
just
as
ranjoor
singh
rode
up
on
bagh
after
an
afternoon
work
teaching
scouts
he
clung
to
the
stirrup
and
was
dragged
ten
feet
slobbering
and
bubbling
incoherencies
before
the
savage
charger
could
be
reined
in
and
made
to
stand
what
is
it
oh
laughed
ranjoor
singh
are
the
moslems
out
after
your
temple
gods
aha
run
gallop
bring
all
the
guns
this
in
english
all
of
it
blood
in
the
gutter
blood
like
water
twentee
policemen
are
already
dead
and
your
men
have
done
it
gallop
quicklee
jaldee
go
and
get
twenty
more
policemen
to
wipe
away
the
blood
advised
ranjoor
singh
sitting
back
in
the
saddle
to
get
a
better
look
at
him
and
reining
back
the
impatient
bagh
i
am
not
a
constabeel
i
am
a
soldier
aha
yes
you
better
hurry
all
your
men
are
underneath
bottom
dog
you
better
hurry
like
slippery
one
afridi
is
beginning
things
and
where
is
one
afridi
with
a
long
knife
are
many
more
kinds
of
trouble
the
babu
was
recovering
his
breath
and
with
it
his
yearning
to
behold
a
regiment
careering
through
the
barrack
gate
to
the
rescue
he
still
clung
to
the
stirrup
and
since
he
would
not
let
go
ranjoor
singh
proceeded
to
tow
him
with
a
cautious
booted
right
leg
ready
to
spur
bagh
away
to
the
left
should
the
brute
commence
to
kick
you
are
person
and
your
fate
is
forever
sealed
if
you
refuse
to
listen
wailed
the
babu
the
blood
of
your
men
lies
in
street
calling
aloud
for
vengeance
a
university
education
works
wonders
for
babu
vocabulary
i
tell
you
it
is
a
riot
and
most
extremelee
serious
affair
that
was
the
wrong
appeal
to
make
as
the
babu
himself
would
have
known
had
he
been
less
excited
in
time
of
riot
the
place
for
a
sikh
officer
would
be
at
the
regiment
headquarters
in
readiness
for
the
order
from
a
civil
magistrate
without
which
interference
would
cost
him
his
commission
but
the
babu
was
beside
himself
what
with
breathlessness
and
disappointment
he
decided
it
was
expedient
to
strengthen
his
appeal
and
his
imagination
was
still
working
there
will
be
two
regiments
of
tommees
drunken
tommees
presentlee
they
will
take
your
men
to
jail
the
tommees
are
already
on
the
way
should
they
get
there
first
your
men
will
be
everlastinglee
disgraced
as
well
as
muleted
you
should
hurry
ranjoor
singh
ceased
from
frowning
and
looked
satisfied
if
there
were
trouble
enough
in
the
bazaar
to
call
for
the
despatch
of
british
soldiers
to
the
scene
then
nothing
in
the
world
was
more
certain
than
that
any
men
of
his
who
happened
to
be
in
danger
would
be
rescued
with
neatness
and
speed
if
there
was
no
trouble
yet
there
would
very
likely
be
some
swearing
when
the
soldiers
got
there
in
the
meantime
he
was
wet
through
both
with
rain
and
perspiration
the
thought
of
a
bath
and
dry
clothes
urged
him
like
the
voice
of
a
siren
calling
and
he
had
shown
the
babu
all
the
courtesy
his
sikh
creed
and
profession
demanded
so
he
clucked
to
bagh
and
the
big
brute
plunged
into
a
canter
just
as
eager
for
his
sais
and
gram
as
his
master
was
for
clean
dry
clothes
for
two
strides
the
babu
clung
to
the
stirrup
wrenching
it
free
from
the
foot
then
the
horse
grew
savage
at
the
unaccustomed
extra
weight
and
lashed
out
hard
behind
him
missing
the
babu
twice
in
quick
succession
but
filling
him
full
to
the
stuttering
teeth
with
fear
ranjoor
singh
touched
the
horse
with
his
right
spur
and
in
a
second
the
babu
lay
along
on
his
stomach
in
the
mud
he
lay
for
a
minute
believing
himself
dead
then
he
cried
aloud
since
he
knew
he
must
be
broken
into
pieces
then
he
felt
himself
at
last
he
rose
and
after
a
speechless
glance
at
the
back
of
the
started
slowly
along
the
street
toward
where
the
riot
was
it
is
enough
he
said
in
english
since
he
was
a
failed
to
try
the
patience
of
job
comforter
this
militaree
business
has
corrupted
even
sikh
cavalry
until
they
no
longer
are
dependable
yes
it
is
time
it
is
time
indeed
that
german
influence
be
felt
in
order
that
british
yoke
may
be
cast
off
for
good
and
all
now
i
take
it
a
german
soldier
would
have
arrested
everybodee
and
i
would
have
received
much
in
addition
to
cash
reward
paid
for
information
in
meantime
it
is
to
be
seen
whether
or
not
yes
precisely
a
pencil
is
mightier
than
a
sword
which
means
that
a
babu
is
superior
in
wit
and
general
attainments
let
us
see
he
began
to
run
again
at
a
truly
astonishing
pace
considering
his
paunch
and
ungainliness
getting
over
the
ground
faster
than
many
a
thin
man
could
have
done
as
he
ran
his
lips
worked
for
though
he
had
no
breath
to
spare
for
speech
his
brain
was
forming
words
that
crowded
for
expression
the
sikhs
he
screamed
as
he
came
within
earshot
of
the
milling
crowd
through
which
four
small
policemen
were
trying
to
force
a
path
the
sikhs
they
ride
to
the
rescue
the
sikhs
yelled
somebody
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
who
had
more
breath
but
not
enough
imagination
to
ask
questions
the
sikhs
are
coming
run
the
sikhs
the
sikhs
the
crowd
took
it
up
and
since
it
was
a
crowd
and
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
and
since
it
had
had
protection
but
no
violence
at
sikh
hands
ever
since
and
since
the
babu
really
did
look
frightened
it
shouted
that
the
sikhs
were
coming
until
it
believed
the
news
and
had
made
itself
thoroughly
afraid
run
brothers
shouted
some
man
in
the
middle
who
owned
a
voice
like
a
and
that
being
a
new
idea
and
just
as
good
as
any
the
whole
crowd
took
to
its
heels
leaving
the
four
policemen
staring
at
the
body
of
a
dead
sikh
and
the
fat
babu
complacently
regarding
all
of
them
presently
a
european
police
officer
trotted
up
on
a
white
pony
examined
the
body
asked
a
dozen
questions
of
the
four
policemen
wrote
in
his
memorandum
book
and
ordered
the
body
to
be
taken
to
the
morgue
come
here
you
he
called
to
the
babu
so
the
babu
waddled
to
him
judging
his
salaam
shrewdly
so
that
it
suggested
deference
while
leaving
no
doubt
as
to
the
intended
insult
what
do
you
know
about
this
as
peaceful
citizen
in
pursuance
of
daily
bread
and
other
perquisites
i
claim
protection
of
police
while
proceeding
on
way
was
thrown
to
ground
violentlee
by
galloping
horse
whose
rider
urged
same
in
opposite
direction
observe
my
deshabille
regard
this
mud
on
my
person
i
insist
on
full
rigor
of
the
law
for
which
i
am
taxed
inordinately
what
sort
of
a
horse
who
rode
it
how
long
ago
am
losing
all
count
of
time
since
being
overwhelmed
should
say
veree
recently
however
the
horse
was
ridden
by
a
person
who
urged
it
vehemently
it
was
a
brown
horse
i
think
which
way
did
he
go
how
should
i
know
he
went
away
knocking
me
over
in
transit
and
causing
me
great
distress
was
he
armed
two
arms
with
one
he
steered
the
animal
with
the
other
he
urged
him
thus
the
babu
described
in
pantomime
an
imaginary
human
riding
for
his
life
whom
not
even
the
adroitest
police
officer
could
recognize
as
ranjoor
singh
even
had
he
been
acquainted
with
the
had
he
a
weapon
of
any
kind
not
knowing
would
prefer
to
say
nothing
about
that
it
was
with
the
horse
with
the
rump
of
the
animal
that
he
hit
me
and
not
with
a
sword
of
any
kind
well
you
had
better
come
with
me
to
the
office
and
there
we
take
down
your
deposition
am
i
arrested
no
you
a
witness
on
the
contrary
i
am
prosecutor
i
demand
as
stated
formerly
full
rigor
of
the
law
i
demand
capture
and
arrest
together
with
fine
and
imprisonment
of
party
assaulting
me
failing
which
i
shall
address
complaint
to
government
come
along
we
talk
about
that
at
the
office
so
the
babu
was
escorted
to
the
stuffy
little
police
office
where
he
was
made
to
sit
on
a
bench
beside
ten
native
witnesses
of
other
crimes
and
presently
he
was
called
to
a
desk
at
which
a
native
clerk
presided
there
he
was
made
to
recite
his
story
again
and
since
he
had
had
time
in
which
to
think
he
told
a
most
amazing
disconnected
yarn
that
looked
even
more
untruthful
by
the
time
the
clerk
had
written
his
own
version
of
it
on
a
sheet
to
this
version
the
babu
was
required
to
swear
and
he
did
so
without
a
blink
then
there
was
more
delay
while
somebody
was
found
who
knew
him
and
could
certify
to
his
address
and
it
was
nearly
evening
by
the
time
he
was
allowed
to
go
it
was
also
nearly
evening
when
a
messenger
arrived
at
the
barracks
to
report
the
death
of
a
sikh
trooper
by
murder
in
the
bazaar
the
name
and
regimental
number
proved
him
to
have
been
one
of
d
men
and
since
its
commander
ranjoor
singh
was
then
in
quarters
the
news
was
brought
to
him
at
once
killed
where
he
demanded
so
they
told
him
exactly
when
it
became
evident
to
ranjoor
singh
that
there
had
been
some
truth
after
all
in
the
babu
tale
the
verbal
precis
of
the
only
witness
given
from
memory
about
a
man
who
galloped
away
on
horseback
threw
no
light
at
all
on
the
case
so
because
he
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
do
at
the
moment
the
sent
for
a
and
drove
down
to
the
morgue
to
identify
the
body
on
the
way
back
from
the
morgue
he
looked
in
at
the
police
station
but
the
babu
had
been
gone
some
ten
minutes
when
he
arrived
the
police
could
tell
him
nothing
it
was
explained
that
the
crowd
directly
after
the
murder
had
been
too
great
to
allow
any
but
those
nearest
to
see
anything
and
it
was
admitted
that
the
crowd
had
been
suddenly
and
had
scattered
before
the
police
could
secure
witnesses
so
he
drove
away
wondering
and
ordered
the
driver
to
follow
the
road
taken
by
the
murdered
trooper
it
was
just
on
the
edge
of
evening
when
the
lighted
were
yet
too
pale
to
show
distinctly
that
he
passed
the
disused
boarded
shop
and
saw
on
the
side
of
the
street
opposite
the
babu
who
had
brought
him
the
story
of
riot
that
afternoon
he
stopped
his
carriage
and
stepped
out
on
second
thought
he
ordered
the
carriage
away
for
he
was
in
plain
clothes
and
not
likely
to
attract
notice
and
he
had
a
suspicion
in
his
mind
that
he
might
care
to
investigate
a
little
on
his
own
account
he
walked
straight
to
the
babu
and
that
gentleman
eyed
him
with
obvious
distrust
did
you
see
my
trooper
murdered
he
demanded
for
he
had
learned
directness
under
colonel
kirby
and
applied
it
to
every
difficulty
that
confronted
him
natives
understand
directness
from
an
englishman
and
can
parry
it
but
from
another
native
it
bewilders
them
just
as
a
swordsman
is
bewildered
by
another
the
babu
blinked
how
much
had
you
seen
when
you
ran
to
warn
me
this
afternoon
the
babu
looked
pitiful
his
fat
defenseless
body
was
an
absolute
contrast
to
the
sikh
tall
manly
figure
his
eye
was
furtive
glancing
ever
sidewise
but
the
sikh
looked
straight
and
spoke
abruptly
though
with
a
note
of
kindness
in
his
voice
there
is
no
need
to
fear
me
he
said
since
the
babu
would
not
answer
speak
how
much
do
you
know
so
the
babu
took
heart
of
grace
producing
a
voice
from
somewhere
down
in
his
enormous
stomach
and
saying
of
course
the
very
last
thing
expected
of
him
grief
chokes
me
he
asserted
take
care
that
i
choke
thee
not
i
have
asked
a
question
i
am
no
lawyer
to
maneuver
for
my
answer
did
you
see
that
trooper
killed
the
babu
nodded
but
his
nod
was
not
much
more
than
tentative
he
could
have
denied
it
next
minute
without
calling
much
on
his
imagination
oh
which
way
went
the
murderer
grief
overwhelms
me
said
the
babu
grief
for
what
for
my
money
my
good
money
my
emoluments
direct
as
an
arrow
though
he
was
in
all
his
dealings
ranjoor
singh
had
not
forgotten
how
the
old
east
thinks
he
recognized
the
preliminaries
of
a
bargain
and
searched
his
mind
to
recall
how
much
money
he
had
with
him
to
have
searched
his
pocket
would
have
been
too
puerile
what
of
them
lost
where
how
while
standing
here
observing
movements
of
him
whom
i
suspected
to
be
murderer
a
person
unknown
possibly
a
sikh
perhaps
not
removed
money
surreptitiously
from
my
person
how
much
money
rupees
annas
eight
said
the
babu
unwinking
he
neither
blushed
nor
hesitated
i
will
take
compassion
on
your
loss
and
replace
five
rupees
of
it
said
ranjoor
singh
when
you
have
told
me
which
way
the
murderer
went
my
eyes
are
too
dim
and
my
heart
too
full
with
grief
said
the
babu
no
man
memory
works
under
such
conditions
now
that
money
i
will
give
you
ten
rupees
said
ranjoor
singh
this
was
too
easy
the
babu
was
prepared
to
bargain
for
an
hour
fighting
for
rupee
after
rupee
until
his
wit
assured
him
he
had
reached
the
limit
now
he
began
to
believe
he
had
set
the
limit
far
too
low
i
do
not
remember
he
said
slowly
but
with
great
conviction
scratching
at
his
stomach
as
if
he
kept
his
recollections
stored
there
you
said
rupees
eight
annas
well
i
will
pay
the
half
of
it
and
no
more
said
ranjoor
singh
in
a
new
voice
that
seemed
to
suggest
unutterable
things
moreover
i
will
pay
it
when
i
have
proved
thy
memory
true
now
scratch
that
belly
of
thine
and
let
the
thoughts
come
forth
nay
sahib
i
forget
ranjoor
singh
drew
out
his
purse
and
counted
twelve
rupees
and
three
quarters
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
which
way
he
demanded
rupees
eight
annas
of
earned
emolument
gone
while
i
watched
the
movements
of
a
murderer
it
is
not
easy
to
keep
brave
heart
and
remember
things
see
here
thou
bellyful
of
memories
remember
and
tell
me
or
i
return
this
money
to
my
purse
and
march
thee
by
the
nape
of
thy
fat
neck
to
the
police
station
where
they
will
put
thee
in
a
cell
for
the
night
and
jog
thy
memory
in
ways
the
police
are
said
to
understand
speak
here
take
the
money
the
babu
reached
out
a
fat
hand
and
the
silver
changed
owners
there
said
the
babu
jerking
a
thumb
over
his
right
shoulder
through
that
door
that
narrow
teak
door
down
the
passage
but
the
babu
was
gone
hurrying
as
if
goaded
by
fear
of
hell
and
all
its
angels
ranjoor
singh
strode
across
the
street
in
a
and
entered
the
dark
passage
he
had
seen
the
yellow
light
of
a
through
a
chink
in
an
upper
shutter
and
he
intended
to
try
directness
on
the
problem
once
again
it
was
ten
full
paces
down
the
passage
to
the
door
he
counted
them
finishing
the
last
one
with
a
kick
against
the
panel
that
would
have
driven
it
in
had
it
been
less
than
teak
there
came
no
answer
so
he
kicked
again
then
he
beat
on
the
door
with
his
clenched
fists
presently
he
turned
his
back
to
the
door
and
kept
up
a
steady
thunder
on
it
with
his
heels
and
then
after
about
five
minutes
he
heard
movement
within
he
congratulated
himself
then
that
the
noise
he
had
made
had
called
the
attention
of
and
of
all
the
neighbors
and
though
he
had
had
no
fear
and
no
other
intention
than
to
enter
the
house
at
all
costs
he
certainly
had
that
much
less
compunction
now
he
heard
three
different
bolts
drawn
back
and
then
there
was
a
pause
he
thought
he
heard
whispering
so
he
resumed
his
thunder
almost
at
once
there
followed
the
unmistakable
squeak
of
a
big
beam
turning
on
its
pivot
and
the
door
opened
about
an
inch
he
pushed
but
some
one
inside
pushed
harder
and
the
door
closed
again
so
ranjoor
singh
leaned
all
his
weight
and
strength
against
the
door
drawing
in
his
breath
and
shoving
with
all
his
might
resistance
ceased
the
door
flew
inward
as
it
had
done
once
before
that
day
and
closed
with
a
bang
behind
him
long
were
the
days
and
oh
wicked
the
weather
endless
and
thankless
the
round
grinding
god
grit
into
rookies
together
i
was
the
upper
stone
he
was
the
nether
and
gad
sir
they
groaned
as
we
ground
bitter
the
blame
but
he
helped
me
to
bear
it
grim
the
despair
that
we
ate
but
hell
loose
the
dam
down
and
none
can
repair
it
is
our
turn
go
summon
my
brother
to
share
it
his
squadron
at
arms
and
we
wait
chapter
v
a
regiment
is
more
exacting
of
its
colonel
than
ever
was
lady
of
her
lord
the
more
truly
he
commands
the
better
it
loves
him
until
at
last
the
regiment
swallows
him
and
he
becomes
part
of
it
in
thought
and
word
and
deed
distractions
such
as
polo
are
tolerable
insofar
as
they
steady
his
nerve
and
train
his
hand
and
eye
to
that
extent
they
too
subserve
the
regiment
but
a
woman
is
a
rival
so
it
is
counted
no
sin
against
a
cavalry
colonel
should
he
be
a
bachelor
there
remained
no
virtue
then
in
the
eyes
of
outram
own
for
colonel
kirby
to
acquire
he
had
all
that
they
could
imagine
besides
at
least
a
dozen
they
had
not
imagined
before
he
came
to
them
there
was
not
one
gentleman
who
couched
a
lance
behind
him
but
believed
colonel
kirby
some
sort
of
and
in
return
colonel
kirby
found
the
regiment
so
satisfying
that
there
was
not
even
a
lady
on
the
who
could
look
forward
to
encroaching
on
the
preserves
his
heart
his
honor
and
his
rare
ability
were
all
the
regiment
and
the
regiment
knew
it
so
he
was
studied
as
is
the
lot
of
few
his
servant
knew
which
shoes
he
would
wear
on
a
thursday
morning
and
would
have
them
ready
the
spiced
the
curry
so
exactly
to
his
taste
that
more
than
one
claimed
it
to
be
a
species
apart
and
labeled
it
with
his
name
if
he
frowned
the
troopers
knew
somebody
had
tried
to
flatter
him
if
he
smiled
the
regiment
grinned
and
when
his
face
lacked
all
expression
though
his
eyes
were
more
than
usually
quick
officer
officer
and
man
alike
would
sit
tight
in
the
saddle
so
to
speak
and
gather
up
their
reins
his
mood
was
recognized
that
afternoon
as
he
drove
back
from
the
club
while
he
was
yet
four
hundred
yards
away
although
twilight
was
closing
down
the
waler
mare
sixteen
three
and
a
half
with
one
white
stocking
and
a
blaze
that
could
be
seen
from
the
brought
his
big
through
the
street
mud
at
a
speed
which
would
have
insured
the
arrest
of
the
driver
of
a
motor
but
that
if
anything
was
a
sign
of
ordinary
health
nor
was
the
way
he
took
the
corner
by
the
barrack
gate
on
one
wheel
any
criterion
he
always
did
it
just
as
he
never
failed
to
acknowledge
the
sentry
salute
by
raising
his
whip
it
needed
the
observant
eyes
of
outram
own
to
detect
the
rather
strained
calmness
and
the
almost
inhumanly
active
eye
beware
called
the
sentry
while
he
was
yet
three
hundred
yards
away
be
awake
be
awake
be
awake
beware
the
warning
went
from
lip
to
lip
troop
to
troop
from
squadron
stables
on
to
squadron
stables
until
six
hundred
men
were
ready
for
all
contingencies
a
civilian
might
not
have
recognized
the
difference
but
kirby
soldier
servant
awakened
from
his
nap
on
the
colonel
and
straightened
his
turban
in
a
hurry
perfectly
well
aware
that
there
was
something
in
the
wind
it
was
too
early
to
dress
for
dinner
yet
too
late
to
dress
for
games
of
any
kind
the
servant
was
nonplussed
he
stood
in
silence
awaiting
orders
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
or
at
an
ordinary
hour
would
have
been
unnecessary
but
for
a
while
no
orders
came
the
only
sound
in
those
extremely
unmarried
quarters
was
the
steady
drip
of
water
into
a
flat
tin
bath
that
the
servant
had
put
beneath
a
spot
where
the
roof
leaked
the
rain
had
ceased
but
the
ceiling
cloth
still
drooped
and
drooled
suddenly
kirby
threw
himself
backward
into
a
long
chair
and
the
servant
made
ready
for
swift
action
present
my
compliments
to
ranjoor
singh
sahib
and
ask
him
to
be
good
enough
to
see
me
here
the
servant
saluted
and
was
gone
kirby
relapsed
again
into
the
depth
of
the
chair
staring
at
the
wall
in
front
of
him
letting
his
eye
travel
from
one
to
another
of
the
accurately
pictures
pieces
of
furniture
and
trophies
that
proclaimed
him
unmarried
there
was
nothing
whatever
in
his
quarters
to
decoy
him
from
his
love
there
were
polo
sticks
in
a
corner
where
a
woman
would
have
placed
a
standard
lamp
and
where
the
flowers
should
have
stood
was
a
chest
to
hold
there
was
a
vague
smell
about
the
place
of
varnish
polish
and
good
leather
the
servant
was
back
again
stiff
at
the
salute
within
five
minutes
not
there
not
where
not
in
his
quarters
then
go
and
find
him
ask
where
he
is
hurry
so
since
the
regiment
was
keyed
to
watchfulness
it
took
about
five
minutes
more
before
it
was
known
that
ranjoor
singh
was
not
in
barracks
the
servant
returned
to
report
that
he
had
been
seen
driving
toward
the
bazaar
in
a
then
entered
warrington
the
adjutant
and
the
servant
was
dismissed
at
once
bad
business
said
warrington
looking
thoroughly
cheerful
what
now
one
of
squadron
d
men
murdered
in
the
bazaar
this
afternoon
in
the
morgue
in
charge
of
the
police
man
who
was
with
him
apparently
missing
no
explanation
and
the
say
there
are
any
clues
he
twisted
at
a
little
black
mustache
and
began
to
hum
know
where
ranjoor
singh
is
by
any
chance
asked
kirby
give
me
three
guesses
no
two
one
he
raising
hell
with
all
the
police
in
delhi
two
he
at
the
scene
of
the
murder
doing
detective
work
on
his
own
i
heard
he
driven
away
and
anyhow
it
his
squadron
man
probably
his
second
cousin
twenty
or
thirty
times
removed
send
somebody
to
find
him
ordered
kirby
say
you
want
to
have
a
word
with
him
kirby
nodded
and
warrington
swaggered
out
humming
to
himself
exactly
as
he
hoped
to
be
humming
when
his
last
grim
call
should
come
the
incarnation
of
efficiency
awake
and
very
glad
a
certain
number
of
seconds
after
he
had
gone
two
mounted
troopers
clattered
out
toward
the
bazaar
ten
minutes
later
warrington
returned
d
squadron
squattin
on
its
hunkers
in
rings
an
lookin
gloomy
he
said
as
if
he
were
announcing
some
good
news
that
had
a
touch
of
humor
in
it
by
the
look
of
you
say
they
been
passed
over
for
active
service
and
were
meditatin
matrimony
by
gad
warrington
you
do
know
how
near
that
guess
is
to
the
truth
kirby
lips
were
smiling
but
his
voice
was
hard
warrington
glanced
quickly
at
him
once
and
then
looked
serious
you
mean
yes
said
kirby
has
it
broken
yet
no
is
it
goin
to
break
looks
like
it
looks
to
me
as
if
it
all
been
prearranged
our
crowd
are
sparring
for
time
and
the
prussians
are
all
in
a
hurry
looks
that
way
to
me
and
you
mean
there
a
chance
even
a
chance
of
us
of
outram
own
bein
out
of
it
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
are
you
serious
yes
said
kirby
and
warrington
jaw
fell
any
details
that
are
not
too
confidential
for
me
to
know
asked
warrington
tell
you
all
about
it
after
i
had
a
word
with
ranjoor
singh
had
i
better
go
and
help
look
for
him
yes
if
you
like
so
within
another
certain
number
of
split
seconds
captain
charlie
warrington
rode
as
the
french
say
and
the
fact
that
the
monsoon
chose
that
instant
to
let
pour
another
noah
deluge
seemed
to
make
no
difference
at
all
to
his
ardor
or
the
pace
to
which
he
spurred
his
horse
an
angry
police
officer
grumbled
that
night
at
the
club
about
the
arrogance
of
all
cavalrymen
but
of
one
warrington
in
particular
wanted
to
know
by
the
big
blue
bull
of
bashan
whether
i
knew
when
a
case
was
serious
or
not
yes
he
did
seemed
to
think
the
murder
of
one
sowar
was
the
only
criminal
case
in
all
delhi
and
had
the
nerve
to
invite
me
to
set
every
constable
in
what
he
termed
my
parish
on
the
one
job
what
did
i
say
told
him
to
call
of
course
said
see
gad
you
should
have
heard
him
swear
then
thought
his
eyes
burn
holes
in
my
tunic
went
careering
out
of
the
office
as
if
war
had
been
declared
talking
of
war
said
somebody
nursing
a
long
drink
under
the
swinging
punkah
do
you
suppose
so
the
manners
of
india
pet
cavalry
were
forgotten
at
once
in
the
vortex
of
the
only
topic
that
had
interest
for
any
one
in
clubdom
and
it
was
not
noticed
whether
warrington
or
his
colonel
or
any
other
officer
of
native
cavalry
looked
in
at
the
club
that
night
warrington
rode
into
the
rain
at
the
same
speed
at
which
he
had
galloped
to
the
police
station
overhauled
one
of
the
mounted
troopers
whom
he
himself
had
sent
in
search
of
ranjoor
singh
rated
him
soundly
in
punjabi
for
loafing
on
the
way
and
galloped
on
with
the
laboring
in
his
wake
he
reined
in
abreast
of
the
second
trooper
who
had
halted
by
a
and
was
trying
to
appear
to
enjoy
the
deluge
any
word
asked
warrington
i
spoke
with
two
who
said
he
entered
by
that
small
door
down
the
passage
sahib
where
there
is
no
light
it
is
a
teak
door
bolted
and
with
no
keyhole
on
the
outside
good
for
you
said
warrington
glancing
quickly
up
and
down
the
wet
street
where
the
lamps
gleamed
deceptively
in
pools
of
running
water
there
seemed
nobody
in
sight
but
that
is
a
bold
guess
in
delhi
where
the
shadows
all
have
eyes
he
gave
a
quiet
order
and
trooper
number
one
passed
his
reins
to
number
two
go
and
try
that
door
kick
it
in
if
you
can
but
be
quick
and
try
not
to
be
noisy
the
trooper
swung
out
of
the
saddle
and
obeyed
while
warrington
and
the
other
man
faced
back
to
back
watching
each
way
against
surprise
in
india
as
in
lands
less
civilized
the
cavalry
are
not
allowed
to
usurp
the
functions
of
police
and
the
officer
or
man
who
tries
it
does
so
at
his
own
risk
there
came
a
sound
of
sudden
thundering
on
teak
that
ceased
after
two
minutes
the
door
is
stout
there
is
no
answer
from
within
said
the
trooper
then
wait
here
on
foot
commanded
warrington
get
under
cover
and
watch
stay
here
until
you
relieved
unless
something
particularly
worth
reporting
happens
in
that
case
hurry
and
report
for
instance
he
hesitated
trying
to
imagine
something
out
of
the
unimaginable
suppose
the
were
to
come
out
then
give
him
the
message
and
come
home
with
him
but
oh
suppose
the
place
takes
fire
or
there
a
riot
or
you
hear
a
fight
going
on
inside
then
hurry
to
barracks
understand
the
wet
trooper
nodded
and
saluted
get
into
a
shadow
then
and
keep
as
dry
as
you
can
ordered
warrington
come
on
he
called
to
the
other
man
and
a
second
later
he
was
charging
through
the
street
as
if
he
rode
with
despatches
through
a
zone
of
rifle
fire
behind
him
clattered
a
trooper
and
two
horses
colonel
kirby
stepped
out
of
his
bathroom
just
as
warrington
arrived
and
arranged
his
white
before
the
mirror
looks
fishy
to
me
sir
said
warrington
hurrying
in
and
standing
where
the
rain
from
his
wet
clothes
would
do
least
harm
there
was
a
space
on
the
floor
between
two
where
the
matting
was
a
little
threadbare
messengers
orderlies
or
servants
always
stood
on
that
spot
after
a
moment
however
kirby
servant
brought
warrington
a
bathroom
mat
how
d
mean
warrington
explained
what
did
the
police
say
said
they
were
busy
now
i
could
go
to
the
club
mused
kirby
and
see
hetherington
and
have
a
talk
with
him
and
get
him
to
sign
a
armed
with
that
we
could
perhaps
persuade
a
police
officer
to
send
two
constables
with
it
morning
said
warrington
with
a
grin
yes
said
kirby
and
if
we
do
much
on
our
own
account
we
fall
foul
of
the
indian
penal
code
which
altereth
every
week
said
warrington
if
it
were
for
the
fact
that
i
particularly
want
a
word
with
him
said
kirby
giving
a
last
tweak
to
his
tie
and
reaching
out
for
his
that
the
servant
had
laid
on
a
chair
there
not
be
much
ground
that
i
can
see
for
action
of
any
kind
he
has
a
right
to
go
where
he
likes
that
point
of
view
did
not
seem
to
have
occurred
to
warrington
before
nor
did
he
quite
like
it
for
he
frowned
on
the
other
hand
said
kirby
diving
into
his
and
shrugging
his
neat
shoulders
until
they
fitted
into
it
as
a
charger
fits
into
his
skin
under
the
circumstances
and
taking
into
consideration
certain
private
information
that
has
reached
me
if
i
were
supposed
to
be
behind
a
bolted
door
in
the
bazaar
i
rather
appreciate
it
if
ranjoor
singh
for
instance
were
to
ah
take
action
of
some
kind
exactly
sir
hallo
what
that
a
driven
at
racing
speed
thundered
up
the
lane
between
the
old
stacked
cannon
and
came
to
a
panting
standstill
by
the
outer
door
a
gruff
question
was
answered
gruffly
and
a
man
step
sounded
on
the
veranda
then
the
servant
flung
the
door
wide
and
a
british
soldier
stepped
smartly
into
the
room
saluted
and
held
out
a
telegram
kirby
tore
it
open
his
eyes
blazed
but
his
hands
were
steady
the
soldier
held
out
a
receipt
book
and
a
pencil
and
kirby
took
time
to
scribble
his
initials
in
the
proper
place
warrington
humming
to
himself
began
to
squeeze
the
rain
out
of
his
tunic
to
hide
impatience
the
soldier
saluted
faced
about
and
hurried
to
the
waiting
car
then
kirby
read
the
telegram
he
nodded
to
warrington
warrington
his
pressed
tight
into
his
palms
and
his
forearms
quivering
raised
one
eyebrow
yes
said
kirby
war
sir
war
we
under
orders
not
yet
it
says
likely
to
be
general
be
ready
here
read
it
for
yourself
they
would
have
sent
us
that
if
addressed
to
troops
they
had
those
ready
written
out
and
sent
one
to
every
on
the
list
the
second
they
knew
well
sir
leave
the
room
lal
singh
the
servant
who
was
screwing
up
his
courage
to
edge
nearer
did
as
he
was
told
kirby
stood
still
facing
the
mirror
with
both
arms
behind
him
they
certain
to
send
native
indian
troops
to
europe
he
said
we
ready
sir
we
ready
to
a
we
go
first
we
be
last
warrington
supposing
we
go
at
all
unless
we
find
ranjoor
singh
they
send
us
to
do
police
work
in
bengal
or
to
guard
the
bombay
docks
and
watch
the
other
fellows
go
i
going
to
the
club
you
better
come
with
me
hurry
into
dry
clothes
he
glanced
at
the
clock
we
just
have
time
to
drive
past
the
house
where
you
say
supposed
to
be
if
you
hurry
the
last
three
words
were
lost
for
captain
warrington
had
turned
into
a
thunderbolt
and
disappeared
the
noise
of
his
going
was
as
when
a
sudden
windstorm
slams
all
the
doors
at
once
a
moment
later
he
could
be
heard
shouting
from
outside
his
quarters
to
his
servant
to
be
ready
for
him
he
certainly
bathed
for
the
noise
of
the
tub
overturning
when
he
was
done
with
it
was
unmistakable
and
eight
minutes
after
his
departure
he
was
back
again
dressed
cloaked
and
ready
got
your
pistol
sir
yes
said
kirby
thought
i
bring
mine
along
you
never
know
you
know
together
they
climbed
into
the
colonel
well
smothered
under
waterproofs
kirby
touched
up
another
of
his
walers
the
sais
grabbed
at
the
back
seat
and
jumped
for
his
life
and
they
shot
out
of
the
compound
down
the
line
of
useless
cannon
and
out
into
the
street
taking
the
corner
as
the
honor
of
the
regiment
required
then
the
two
big
sent
their
shafts
of
light
straight
down
the
metaled
muddy
road
and
the
horse
settled
down
between
them
to
do
his
equine
demdest
there
was
a
touch
on
the
reins
he
recognized
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
bazaar
to
find
the
crowd
stirring
although
strangely
mute
they
have
got
the
news
in
an
hour
from
now
said
kirby
they
can
smell
it
already
wonder
how
much
truth
there
is
in
all
this
talk
about
german
merchants
and
propaganda
said
kirby
steady
sir
lookout
the
near
wheel
missed
a
native
woman
by
a
fraction
of
an
inch
and
her
shrill
scream
followed
them
but
kirby
kept
his
eyes
ahead
and
the
shadows
continued
to
flash
by
them
in
a
swift
procession
until
warrington
leaned
forward
and
then
kirby
leaned
back
against
the
reins
there
he
is
sir
they
reined
to
a
halt
and
a
drenched
trooper
jumped
up
behind
to
kneel
on
the
back
seat
and
speak
in
whispers
no
sign
of
him
at
all
asked
kirby
no
sahib
but
there
has
been
a
light
behind
a
shutter
above
there
it
comes
and
goes
they
light
it
and
extinguish
it
has
anybody
come
out
of
that
door
no
sahib
none
gone
in
none
any
other
door
to
the
place
there
may
be
a
dozen
sahib
that
is
an
old
house
and
it
backs
up
against
six
others
what
we
suffer
from
in
this
country
is
information
said
warrington
beginning
to
hum
to
himself
but
kirby
signed
to
the
trooper
and
the
man
began
to
scramble
out
of
the
cart
between
now
and
our
return
report
to
the
club
if
anything
happens
called
warrington
the
whip
swished
the
horse
shot
forward
and
they
were
off
again
as
if
they
would
catch
up
with
the
hurrying
seconds
people
scattered
to
the
right
and
left
in
front
of
them
a
constable
at
a
street
crossing
blew
his
whistle
frantically
once
the
horse
slipped
in
a
deep
puddle
and
all
but
came
to
earth
but
they
reached
the
club
without
mishap
and
drove
up
the
winding
drive
at
a
speed
more
in
keeping
with
convention
oh
hallo
kirby
glad
you
come
said
a
voice
evening
sir
kirby
descended
almost
into
the
arms
of
a
general
in
evening
dress
they
walked
into
the
club
together
leaving
the
adjutant
wondering
what
to
do
he
decided
to
follow
them
at
a
decent
distance
still
humming
and
looking
happy
enough
for
six
men
you
be
among
the
first
said
the
general
are
you
ready
kirby
absolutely
ready
yes
the
wires
are
working
to
the
limit
it
is
settled
yet
whether
troops
go
from
here
via
canada
or
the
red
sea
probably
wo
be
until
the
navy
had
a
chance
to
clear
the
road
all
that
known
yet
is
that
belgium
invaded
and
that
every
living
man
jack
who
can
be
hurried
to
the
front
in
time
to
keep
the
germans
out
of
paris
will
be
sent
hold
yourself
ready
to
entrain
any
minute
kirby
is
martial
law
proclaimed
yet
asked
kirby
in
a
voice
that
the
general
seemed
to
think
was
strained
for
he
looked
around
sharply
not
yet
why
information
sir
anything
else
no
good
night
good
night
sir
kirby
nearly
ran
into
warrington
as
he
hurried
back
toward
the
door
find
a
police
officer
he
ordered
they
all
passed
you
a
minute
ago
sir
answered
warrington
headed
for
police
headquarters
heard
one
of
say
so
kirby
pulled
himself
together
a
stranger
would
not
have
noticed
that
he
needed
it
but
warrington
at
his
elbow
saw
the
effort
and
was
glad
go
to
police
headquarters
then
he
ordered
try
to
get
them
to
bring
a
dozen
men
and
search
that
house
but
do
say
that
ranjoor
singh
in
there
where
i
find
you
sir
barracks
oh
by
the
way
we
a
sure
thing
for
the
front
i
knew
there
was
some
reason
why
i
kept
feelin
cheerful
said
warrington
the
looks
like
gettin
left
unless
said
kirby
you
can
get
the
police
to
act
or
unless
martial
law
proclaimed
at
once
and
i
can
think
of
an
excuse
to
search
the
house
with
a
hundred
men
myself
find
somebody
to
give
you
a
lift
so
long
kirby
swung
into
his
the
sais
did
an
acrobatic
turn
behind
and
again
the
horse
proceeded
to
lower
records
through
streets
that
were
growing
more
and
yet
more
thronged
instead
of
silent
they
tore
barrackward
missing
men
by
a
miracle
every
twelve
yards
kirby
eyes
were
on
a
red
blotch
now
that
danced
and
glowed
above
the
bazaar
a
mile
ahead
it
reminded
him
of
pain
presently
the
horse
sniffed
smoke
and
notified
as
much
before
settling
down
into
his
stride
again
the
din
of
hoarse
excitement
reached
kirby
ears
and
in
a
moment
more
a
khaki
figure
leaped
out
of
a
shadow
and
a
panting
trooper
snatched
at
the
back
seat
was
grabbed
by
the
sais
and
swung
up
in
the
rear
sahib
all
right
i
know
said
kirby
though
he
did
not
know
how
he
knew
they
raced
through
another
dozen
streets
until
the
glare
grew
blinding
and
the
smoke
nearly
choked
him
then
they
were
stopped
entirely
by
the
crowd
and
colonel
kirby
sat
motionless
for
he
had
a
nearly
perfect
view
of
a
holocaust
the
house
in
which
ranjoor
singh
was
supposed
to
be
was
so
far
burned
that
little
more
than
the
walls
was
standing
the
north
wind
hails
from
the
northern
snows
his
voice
is
loud
oh
listen
ye
he
cried
of
death
the
death
he
knows
of
the
mountain
death
oh
listen
ye
who
looks
to
the
north
for
love
looks
long
who
goes
to
the
north
for
gain
goes
wrong
men
hearts
are
hard
and
the
goods
belong
to
the
strong
in
the
north
oh
listen
ye
whose
lot
is
fair
who
loves
his
life
walks
wide
stays
wide
of
the
northern
knife
ye
men
o
the
world
oh
listen
ye
yasmini
song
chapter
vi
there
were
police
and
to
spare
now
nor
any
doubt
of
it
even
the
breath
of
war
beginning
could
not
keep
them
elsewhere
when
a
fire
had
charge
in
the
densest
quarters
of
the
danger
zone
the
din
of
ancient
delhi
roared
skyward
and
the
delhi
crowd
surged
and
fought
to
be
nearer
to
the
flame
but
the
police
already
had
a
cordon
around
the
building
and
another
detachment
was
forcing
the
swarms
of
men
and
women
into
eddying
movement
in
which
something
like
a
system
developed
presently
for
there
began
to
be
a
clear
space
in
which
the
fire
brigade
could
work
any
bodies
recovered
asked
colonel
kirby
leaning
from
the
seat
of
his
high
dogcart
to
speak
to
the
english
fireman
who
stood
sentry
over
the
no
sir
the
fire
had
too
much
headway
before
the
alarm
went
in
when
we
got
here
the
whole
lower
part
was
any
means
of
escape
from
the
building
from
the
rear
as
many
as
from
a
sir
that
house
is
as
old
as
delhi
about
and
there
are
as
any
galleries
up
above
connecting
with
houses
at
the
rear
as
there
are
from
cellar
to
cellar
any
chance
for
anybody
down
in
the
cellar
doubt
it
sir
the
fire
started
there
the
water
do
what
the
fire
left
undone
pretty
bad
trap
sir
i
should
say
if
you
asked
me
no
reports
of
escape
or
rescue
none
that
i
heard
tell
of
and
the
house
seems
doomed
eh
be
some
days
before
they
can
sort
the
debris
over
lucky
if
we
save
the
ten
houses
nearest
it
look
sir
there
she
goes
the
roof
fell
in
sending
five
separate
volumes
of
red
sparks
up
into
the
cloudy
night
as
floor
after
floor
collapsed
beneath
the
weight
the
thunder
of
it
was
almost
drowned
in
a
roar
of
delight
for
the
crowd
sensing
the
new
spirit
of
its
masters
was
in
a
mood
for
the
terrible
then
silence
fell
as
if
that
had
been
an
overture
out
of
the
silence
and
through
the
sea
of
hot
humanity
the
white
of
his
showing
through
the
unbuttoned
front
of
a
military
cloak
warrington
rode
a
borrowed
arab
pony
the
pony
owner
sais
running
beside
him
to
help
clear
a
passage
warrington
was
still
humming
to
himself
as
he
dismissed
both
sais
and
pony
and
climbed
up
beside
kirby
in
the
if
ranjoor
singh
in
that
house
he
in
a
predicament
he
said
cheerfully
i
went
to
police
headquarters
and
the
first
officer
i
spoke
to
told
me
to
go
to
hell
so
i
went
into
the
next
office
where
all
the
big
panjandrums
hide
and
some
of
the
little
ones
and
they
told
me
what
you
know
sir
that
the
house
is
in
flames
and
every
policeman
who
can
be
spared
is
on
the
job
so
i
came
to
see
if
ranjoor
singh
in
there
but
i
do
believe
he
is
why
do
you
i
do
believe
the
lord
send
us
active
service
not
a
real
red
war
against
a
real
enemy
and
play
a
trick
on
ranjoor
singh
ranjoor
singh
a
gentleman
it
would
be
sportsmanlike
to
let
him
die
before
the
game
begins
for
a
minute
or
two
they
watched
the
sparks
go
up
and
the
crowd
striking
at
the
rats
that
still
seemed
to
find
some
place
of
exit
there
a
place
below
there
that
is
red
hot
yet
said
kirby
those
rats
are
not
cooked
through
did
you
tell
the
police
that
you
wanted
a
search
warrant
yes
might
as
well
argue
with
an
all
of
too
busy
for
commissions
in
the
volunteers
to
listen
they
got
it
all
cut
dried
somebody
in
the
basement
upset
a
lamp
according
to
them
nobody
nobody
to
turn
in
the
alarm
until
the
fire
had
complete
charge
they
offer
to
prove
it
when
the
fire
out
and
they
can
sort
the
ashes
tell
a
trooper
of
ours
saw
a
light
there
yes
what
did
they
say
the
lamp
that
was
kicked
over
colonel
kirby
clucked
to
his
horse
and
worked
a
way
out
to
the
edge
of
the
crowd
with
the
skill
of
one
whose
business
is
to
handle
men
in
quantity
then
he
shot
like
a
dart
up
side
streets
and
made
for
barracks
by
a
detour
gad
said
warrington
suddenly
who
told
suppose
dunno
sir
news
leaks
in
delhi
like
water
from
a
lump
of
ice
in
the
darkness
of
the
barrack
wall
there
were
more
than
a
thousand
men
women
and
children
many
of
them
sikhs
who
clamored
to
be
told
things
and
by
the
gate
was
a
guard
of
twenty
men
drawn
up
to
keep
the
crowd
at
bay
the
shrill
voices
of
the
women
drowned
the
answers
of
the
native
officer
as
well
as
the
noise
of
the
approaching
wheels
and
the
guard
had
to
advance
into
the
road
to
clear
a
way
for
its
colonel
the
native
officer
saluted
and
grinned
is
it
true
sahib
he
shouted
and
kirby
raised
his
whip
in
the
affirmative
from
that
instant
the
guard
began
to
make
more
noise
than
the
crowd
beyond
the
wall
kirby
whipped
his
horse
and
took
the
drive
that
led
to
his
quarters
at
a
speed
there
was
no
overhauling
he
wanted
to
be
alone
but
his
senior
major
had
forestalled
him
and
was
waiting
by
his
outer
door
oh
hallo
brammle
yes
come
in
is
it
peace
jehu
asked
brammle
war

first

minute

and
red
sea
and
marseilles
oh
who

be
light
cavalry
all
the
way
first

and
first
crack
at
any
orders
sir
yes
take
charge
i
going
out
and
warrington
going
with
me
know
how
long
we
be
gone
if
anybody
asks
for
me
tell
him
i

tell
the
men
somebody

left
behind
give
my
definite
promise
on
that
point
anything
else
sir
no
then
see
you
later
see
you
later
the
major
went
away
and
kirby
turned
to
his
adjutant
go
and
order
the
closed
shay
warrington
pick
a
driver
who
talk
have
some
grub
sent
in
here
to
me
and
join
me
at
it
in
half
an
hour
say
fifteen
minutes
later
i
some
things
to
see
to
kirby
wanted
very
much
to
be
alone
the
less
actual
contact
a
colonel
has
with
his
men
and
the
more
he
has
with
his
officers
the
better
as
a
rule
but
it
does
not
pay
to
think
in
the
presence
of
either
officers
and
men
alike
should
know
him
as
a
a
man
in
whose
voice
is
neither
doubt
nor
hesitation
thirty
minutes
later
warrington
found
him
just
emerging
from
a
brown
study
india
all
an
dancin
he
remarked
cheerfully
there
was
a
babu
sittin
by
the
barrack
gate
who
offers
to
eat
a
german
a
day
as
long
as
we
catch
for
him
he
the
same
man
that
was
tryin
for
a
job
as
clerk
the
other
day
fat
man
very
no
credentials
bad
hat
send
him
packing
the
guard
did
food
was
laid
on
a
small
table
by
a
silent
servant
who
had
eyes
in
the
back
of
his
head
and
ears
that
would
have
caught
and
analyzed
the
lightest
whisper
but
the
colonel
and
his
adjutant
ate
hurriedly
in
silence
and
the
only
thing
remarkable
that
the
servant
was
able
to
report
to
the
regiment
afterward
was
that
both
drank
only
water
since
all
sikhs
are
supposed
to
be
abstainers
from
strong
drink
that
was
accepted
as
a
favorable
omen
the
shay
arrived
on
time
to
the
second
it
was
the
only
closed
carriage
the
regiment
owned
a
heavy
landau
thing
taken
over
from
the
previous
mess
the
colonel
peered
through
outer
darkness
at
the
box
seat
but
the
driver
did
not
look
toward
him
all
he
could
see
was
that
there
was
only
one
man
on
the
box
where
to
asked
warrington
the
club
warrington
jumped
in
after
him
and
the
driver
sent
his
pair
straining
at
the
traces
as
if
they
had
a
gun
behind
them
three
hundred
yards
beyond
the
barrack
wall
colonel
kirby
knelt
on
the
front
seat
and
poked
the
driver
from
behind
oh
you
he
remarked
as
he
recognized
a
native
risaldar
of
d
squadron
until
the
novelty
wears
off
it
would
disconcert
any
man
to
discover
suddenly
that
his
coachman
is
a
troop
commander
know
a
person
named
yasmini
he
asked
who
does
not
sahib
drive
us
to
her
house
in
a
hurry
the
immediate
answer
was
a
plunge
as
the
whip
descended
on
both
horses
and
the
heavy
carriage
began
to
sway
like
a
boat
in
a
swell
they
tore
through
streets
that
were
living
streams
of
human
beings
streams
that
split
apart
to
let
them
through
and
closed
like
water
again
behind
them
with
his
spurred
heels
on
the
front
seat
warrington
hummed
softly
to
himself
as
ever
happy
so
long
as
there
were
only
action
i
heard
india
spoken
of
as
dead
he
remarked
after
a
while
gad
look
at
that
color
against
the
darkness
if
ranjoor
singh
is
dead
i
going
to
know
it
said
colonel
kirby
and
if
he
is
dead
i
going
to
dig
him
out
or
know
the
reason
why
there
been
foul
play
warrington
i
happen
to
know
that
ranjoor
singh
has
been
suspected
in
a
certain
quarter
incidentally
i
staked
my
own
reputation
on
his
honesty
this
afternoon
and
besides
we
ca
afford
to
lose
a
wing
commander
such
as
he
is
on
the
eve
of
the
real
thing
we
got
to
find
him
once
or
twice
as
they
flashed
by
a
they
were
recognized
as
british
officers
and
then
natives
who
would
have
gone
to
some
trouble
to
seem
insolent
a
few
hours
before
stopped
to
and
salaam
to
them
wonder
how
they
like
german
rule
for
a
change
mused
warrington
india
does
often
wear
her
heart
on
her
sleeve
said
kirby
it
there
said
warrington
india
awake
if
this
is
delhi
and
not
a
nightmare
india
makin
love
to
the
british
they
tore
through
a
city
that
is
polychromatic
in
the
daytime
and
by
night
a
dream
of
phantom
silhouettes
but
that
night
day
and
night
were
blended
in
one
uproar
and
the
chandni
chowk
was
at
floodtide
wave
on
wave
of
excited
human
beings
pouring
into
it
from
a
hundred
bystreets
and
none
pouring
out
again
so
the
risaldar
drove
across
the
chandni
chowk
fighting
his
way
with
the
aid
of
whip
and
voice
and
made
a
wide
circuit
through
dark
lanes
where
groups
of
people
argued
at
the
corners
and
sometimes
a
holy
man
preached
that
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
they
reached
yasmini
from
the
corner
farthest
from
the
chandni
chowk
and
sprang
out
of
the
carriage
the
instant
that
the
risaldar
drew
rein
wait
within
call
commanded
kirby
and
the
risaldar
raised
his
whip
then
with
his
adjutant
at
his
heels
colonel
kirby
dived
through
the
gloomy
opening
in
a
wall
that
yasmini
devised
to
look
as
little
like
an
approach
to
her
or
heaven
as
possible
wonder
if
he
brought
us
to
the
right
place
he
whispered
sniffing
into
the
moldy
darkness
dunno
sir
there
stairs
to
your
left
they
caught
the
sound
of
faint
flute
music
on
an
upper
floor
and
as
kirby
felt
cautiously
for
his
footing
on
the
lower
step
warrington
began
to
whistle
softly
to
himself
next
to
war
an
adventure
of
this
kind
was
the
nearest
he
could
imagine
to
sheer
bliss
and
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
contrive
to
keep
from
singing
the
heavy
teak
stairs
creaked
under
their
joint
weight
and
though
their
eyes
could
not
penetrate
the
upper
blackness
yet
they
both
suspected
rather
than
sensed
some
one
waiting
for
them
at
the
top
kirby
right
hand
instinctively
sought
a
pocket
in
his
cloak
warrington
felt
for
his
pistol
too
for
thirty
or
more
seconds
say
three
steps
they
went
up
like
conspirators
trying
to
move
silently
and
holding
to
the
rail
then
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
appealed
to
both
and
without
a
word
said
each
stepped
forward
like
a
man
so
that
the
staircase
resounded
they
stumbled
on
a
little
landing
after
twenty
steps
and
wasted
about
a
minute
knocking
on
what
felt
like
the
panels
of
a
door
but
then
warrington
peered
into
the
gloom
higher
up
and
saw
dim
light
so
they
essayed
a
second
flight
of
stairs
in
single
file
as
before
and
presently
when
they
had
climbed
some
ten
steps
and
had
turned
to
negotiate
ten
more
that
ascended
at
an
angle
a
curtain
moved
a
little
and
the
dim
light
changed
to
a
sudden
shaft
that
nearly
blinded
them
then
a
heavy
black
curtain
was
drawn
back
on
rings
and
a
hundred
lights
reflected
in
a
dozen
mirrors
twinkled
and
flashed
before
them
so
that
they
could
not
tell
which
way
to
turn
somewhere
there
was
a
glassbead
curtain
but
there
were
so
many
mirrors
that
they
could
not
tell
which
was
the
curtain
and
which
were
its
reflections
the
curtains
all
parted
and
from
the
midst
of
each
there
stepped
a
little
nutbrown
maid
who
seemed
too
lovely
to
be
indian
even
then
they
could
not
tell
which
was
maid
and
which
reflections
until
she
spoke
will
the
sahibs
give
their
names
she
asked
in
hindustani
and
her
voice
suggested
flutes
she
smiled
and
her
teeth
were
whiter
than
a
there
is
nothing
on
earth
whiter
than
her
teeth
were
colonel
kirby
and
captain
warrington
said
kirby
will
the
sahibs
state
their
business
no
then
whom
do
the
sahibs
seek
to
see
does
a
lady
live
here
named
yasmini
surely
sahib
i
wish
to
talk
with
her
a
dozen
little
maids
seemed
to
step
back
through
a
dozen
swaying
curtains
and
a
second
later
for
the
life
of
them
they
could
neither
of
them
tell
through
which
it
was
that
the
music
came
and
the
smell
of
musk
and
but
she
came
back
and
beckoned
to
them
laughing
over
her
shoulder
and
holding
the
middle
curtain
apart
for
them
to
follow
so
one
after
the
other
they
followed
her
kirby
as
became
a
colonel
on
the
eve
of
war
feeling
out
of
place
and
foolish
but
warrington
possessed
by
such
a
feeling
of
curiosity
as
he
had
never
before
tasted
the
heat
inside
the
room
they
entered
was
oppressive
in
spite
of
a
great
open
window
at
which
sat
a
dozen
maids
and
of
the
punkahs
swinging
overhead
so
kirby
undid
his
cloak
and
walked
revealed
a
soldier
in
mess
dress
look
at
innocence
aware
of
itself
whispered
warrington
shut
up
commanded
kirby
striding
forward
a
dozen
perhaps
more
hillmen
of
three
or
four
different
tribes
had
sat
back
against
one
wall
and
looked
suspicious
when
they
entered
but
at
sight
of
kirby
military
clothes
they
had
looked
alarmed
and
moved
as
if
a
whip
had
been
cracked
not
far
away
the
northern
adventurer
does
not
care
to
be
seen
at
his
amusements
nor
does
he
love
to
be
looked
in
on
by
men
in
uniform
but
the
little
maid
beckoned
them
on
still
showing
her
teeth
and
tripping
in
front
of
them
as
if
a
gust
of
wind
were
blowing
her
her
motion
was
that
of
a
dance
reduced
to
a
walk
for
the
sake
of
decorum
through
another
curtain
at
the
farther
end
of
the
long
room
she
led
them
to
a
second
room
all
hung
about
with
silks
and
furnished
with
divans
there
were
mirrors
in
this
room
too
so
that
kirby
laughed
aloud
to
see
how
incongruous
and
completely
out
of
place
he
and
his
adjutant
locked
his
gruff
laugh
came
so
suddenly
that
the
maid
nearly
jumped
out
of
her
skin
will
the
sahibs
be
seated
she
asked
almost
in
a
whisper
as
if
they
had
the
life
out
of
her
and
then
she
ran
out
of
the
room
so
quickly
that
they
were
only
aware
of
the
jingling
curtain
so
they
sat
down
kirby
trying
the
cushions
with
his
foot
until
he
found
some
firm
enough
to
allow
him
to
retain
his
dignity
cavalry
are
not
built
to
sprawl
on
cushions
in
a
man
should
sit
reasonably
upright
or
else
stand
i
say
this
for
myself
he
grunted
as
he
settled
into
place
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
ever
inside
a
native
woman
premises
warrington
did
not
commit
himself
to
speech
they
sat
for
five
minutes
looking
about
them
warrington
beginning
to
be
bored
but
kirby
honestly
interested
by
the
splendor
of
the
hangings
and
the
general
atmosphere
of
eastern
luxury
it
was
warrington
who
grew
uneasy
first
feel
as
if
any
one
was
lookin
at
you
sir
he
asked
out
of
one
side
of
his
mouth
and
then
kirby
noticed
it
and
felt
his
collar
awkwardly
in
all
the
world
there
is
nothing
so
well
calculated
to
sap
a
prepossession
as
the
feeling
that
he
is
secretly
observed
there
was
no
sound
no
movement
no
sign
of
any
one
and
warrington
looked
in
the
mirrors
keenly
while
he
pretended
to
be
interested
in
his
little
mustache
yet
the
sweat
began
to
run
down
colonel
kirby
temples
and
he
felt
at
his
collar
again
to
make
sure
that
it
stood
upright
yes
he
said
i
do
i
going
to
get
up
and
walk
about
he
paced
the
length
of
the
long
room
twice
turning
quickly
at
each
end
but
detecting
no
movement
and
no
eyes
then
he
sat
down
again
beside
warrington
but
the
feeling
still
persisted
suddenly
a
low
laugh
startled
them
a
delicious
laugh
full
of
camaraderie
that
would
have
disarmed
the
suspicion
of
a
wolf
just
as
unexpectedly
a
curtain
less
than
a
yard
away
from
kirby
moved
and
she
stood
before
them
yasmini
she
could
only
be
yasmini
besides
she
had
jasmine
flowers
worked
into
her
hair
like
a
pair
of
bull
buffaloes
startled
from
their
sleep
the
colonel
and
his
adjutant
shot
to
their
feet
and
faced
her
and
to
their
credit
let
it
be
recorded
that
they
dropped
their
eyes
both
of
them
they
felt
like
bounders
they
hated
themselves
for
breaking
in
on
such
loveliness
will
the
sahibs
not
be
seated
again
she
asked
them
in
a
velvet
voice
and
sweating
in
the
neck
they
each
sat
down
now
that
the
first
feeling
of
impropriety
had
given
way
to
curiosity
neither
had
eyes
for
anything
but
her
neither
had
ever
seen
anything
so
beautiful
so
fascinating
so
impudently
lovely
she
was
laughing
at
them
each
knew
it
yet
neither
felt
resentful
well
she
asked
in
hindustani
and
arched
her
eyebrows
questioning
and
colonel
kirby
stammered
because
she
had
made
him
think
of
his
mother
and
the
tender
prelude
to
a
curtain
lecture
yet
this
woman
was
not
old
enough
to
have
been
his
wife
came
to
ask
about
a
friend
of
mine
by
name
risaldar
major
ranjoor
singh
i
understand
you
know
him
she
nodded
and
kirby
fought
with
a
desire
to
let
his
mind
wander
the
subtle
hypnotism
that
the
east
knows
how
to
stage
and
use
was
creeping
over
him
she
stood
so
close
she
seemed
so
like
the
warm
soft
spirit
of
all
womanhood
that
only
the
measured
rising
and
falling
of
her
bosom
under
the
gauzy
drapery
made
her
seem
human
and
not
a
spirit
subtly
ever
so
cunningly
she
had
contrived
to
touch
a
chord
in
colonel
kirby
heart
that
he
did
not
know
lived
any
more
warrington
was
speechless
he
could
not
have
trusted
himself
to
speak
she
had
touched
another
chord
in
him
he
came
here
more
than
once
or
so
i
been
given
to
understand
said
kirby
and
his
own
voice
startled
him
for
it
seemed
harsh
he
is
said
to
have
listened
to
a
lecture
here
i
was
told
the
lecture
was
delivered
by
a
german
and
there
was
some
sort
of
a
fracas
outside
in
the
street
afterward
i
told
some
of
his
squadron
were
near
and
they
thrashed
a
man
now
ranjoor
singh
is
missing
so
said
yasmini
arching
her
whole
lithe
body
into
a
setting
for
the
prettiest
yawn
that
kirby
had
ever
seen
so
the
jat
is
missing
yes
he
came
here
sahib
he
was
never
invited
but
he
came
he
sat
here
saying
nothing
until
it
suited
him
to
sit
where
another
man
was
then
he
struck
the
other
man
so
with
the
sole
of
his
foot
and
took
the
man
place
and
heard
what
he
came
to
hear
later
outside
in
the
street
he
and
his
men
set
on
the
afridi
whom
he
had
struck
with
his
foot
and
beat
him
i
have
heard
a
variation
of
that
said
kirby
have
you
ever
heard
sahib
that
he
who
strikes
the
wearer
of
a
northern
knife
is
like
to
feel
that
knife
so
ranjoor
singh
the
jat
is
missing
yes
said
kirby
frowning
for
he
was
not
pleased
to
hear
ranjoor
singh
spoken
of
slightingly
a
jat
may
be
a
good
enough
man
and
usually
is
but
a
sikh
is
a
jat
who
is
better
and
if
he
is
missing
what
has
that
to
do
with
me
asked
yasmini
i
have
heard
men
say
yes
she
said
laughing
for
it
amused
her
almost
more
than
any
other
thing
to
see
dignity
disarmed
men
say
that
you
know
most
of
what
goes
on
in
delhi
and
she
was
impudence
arrayed
in
gossamer
colonel
kirby
pulled
himself
together
after
all
it
was
not
for
long
that
anything
less
than
an
army
corps
could
make
him
feel
unequal
to
a
situation
this
woman
was
the
loveliest
thing
he
had
ever
seen
but
i
come
to
find
out
whether
ranjoor
singh
alive
or
dead
he
said
sternly
and
if
he
alive
to
take
him
away
with
me
she
smiled
as
graciously
as
evening
smiles
on
the
seeded
plains
and
sank
on
to
a
divan
with
the
grace
it
needs
a
life
of
dancing
to
bestow
sahib
she
said
with
a
suddenly
assumed
air
of
candidness
they
have
told
the
truth
there
is
little
that
goes
on
in
delhi
in
the
world
that
i
can
not
hear
of
if
i
will
the
winds
of
the
world
flow
in
and
out
of
these
four
walls
then
where
is
ranjoor
singh
asked
colonel
kirby
she
did
not
hesitate
an
instant
he
was
watching
her
amazing
eyes
that
surely
would
have
betrayed
her
had
she
been
at
a
moment
loss
they
did
not
change
nor
darken
for
a
second
how
much
does
the
sahib
know
already
she
asked
calmly
as
if
she
wished
to
spare
him
an
unnecessary
repetition
of
mere
beginnings
a
trooper
of
d
squadron
that
ranjoor
singh
squadron
was
murdered
in
the
bazaar
this
afternoon
the
went
to
the
morgue
to
identify
the
body
drove
through
the
bazaar
and
possibly
discovered
some
clue
to
the
murderer
at
all
events
he
is
known
to
have
entered
a
house
in
the
bazaar
and
that
house
is
now
in
flames
the
sahib
knows
that
much
and
am
i
to
quell
the
flames
asked
yasmini
she
neither
sat
nor
lay
on
the
divan
she
was
curled
on
it
leaning
on
an
elbow
like
an
imp
from
another
world
who
owns
that
house
asked
kirby
since
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
ask
that
is
the
brothers
said
yasmini
he
who
built
it
had
eight
wives
and
a
son
by
each
that
was
ages
ago
and
the
descendants
of
the
eight
are
all
at
law
about
the
ownership
there
are
many
stories
told
about
that
house
suddenly
she
broke
into
laughter
leaning
on
her
hand
and
mocking
them
as
puck
mocked
mortals
a
man
could
not
doubt
her
colonel
and
adjutant
both
men
who
had
seen
grim
service
and
both
as
a
rule
knew
that
she
could
read
clean
through
them
and
that
from
the
bottom
of
her
deep
wise
soul
she
was
amused
i
am
from
the
north
she
said
and
the
north
is
cold
there
is
little
mercy
in
the
hills
and
i
was
weaned
amid
them
yet
would
the
sahib
not
better
beg
of
me
how
d
mean
asked
kirby
surprised
into
speaking
english
ago
there
came
a
wind
that
told
of
war
of
a
surely
not
this
time
stillborn
two
years
ago
the
same
wind
brought
me
news
of
its
conception
though
the
talk
of
the
world
was
then
of
universal
peace
and
of
horror
at
a
war
that
was
now
this
greatest
war
is
loose
born
and
grown
big
within
three
days
but
conceived
two
years
ago
russia
germany
austria
france
are
fighting
is
it
not
so
am
i
wrong
i
came
to
ask
about
ranjoor
singh
said
colonel
kirby
twisting
at
his
closely
cropped
mustache
there
was
a
hint
of
iron
in
his
voice
and
he
was
obviously
not
the
man
to
threaten
and
not
fulfil
but
she
laughed
in
his
face
all
in
good
time
she
answered
him
you
shall
beg
for
your
ranjoor
singh
and
then
perhaps
he
shall
step
forth
from
the
burning
house
but
first
you
shall
know
why
you
beg
she
clapped
her
hands
and
a
maid
appeared
she
gave
an
order
and
the
maid
brought
sherbet
that
kirby
sniffed
suspiciously
before
tasting
again
she
laughed
deliciously
does
the
sahib
think
that
he
could
escape
alive
from
this
room
did
i
will
otherwise
she
asked
would
i
need
to
drug
i
who
have
so
many
means
now
it
is
a
maxim
of
light
cavalry
that
the
best
means
of
defense
lies
in
attack
a
threat
of
force
should
be
met
by
a
show
of
force
and
force
by
something
quicker
kirby
eyes
and
his
adjutant
met
each
felt
for
his
hidden
pistol
but
she
laughed
at
them
with
mirth
that
was
so
evidently
unassumed
that
they
blushed
to
their
ears
look
she
said
and
they
looked
two
great
gray
cobras
male
and
female
swayed
behind
them
less
than
a
yard
away
balanced
for
the
strike
hoods
raised
the
awful
ugly
black
eyes
gleamed
with
malice
and
a
swaying
cobra
head
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
hit
with
an
bullet
supposing
for
wild
imagination
sake
that
the
hooded
devil
does
not
strike
first
it
is
not
wise
to
move
purred
yasmini
they
did
not
see
her
make
any
sign
though
she
must
have
made
one
for
their
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
swaying
snakes
and
their
brains
were
active
with
the
problem
of
whether
to
try
to
shoot
or
not
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
snakes
reached
a
resolution
first
and
struck
and
in
the
same
instant
as
each
drew
his
pistol
the
hooded
messengers
of
death
were
jerked
out
of
sight
by
hands
that
snatched
at
horsehair
from
behind
the
hangings
i
have
many
such
smiled
yasmini
and
they
turned
to
meet
her
eyes
again
hoping
she
could
not
read
the
fear
in
theirs
but
that
is
not
why
the
sahib
shall
beg
of
me
kirby
was
not
too
overcome
to
notice
the
future
tense
that
is
only
a
reason
why
the
sahibs
should
forget
their
western
manners
but
if
the
pistols
please
the
sahibs
they
stowed
their
pistols
away
again
and
sat
as
if
the
very
cushions
might
be
stuffed
with
snakes
both
of
them
aware
that
she
had
produced
a
mental
effect
which
was
more
to
her
advantage
than
the
pistols
would
have
been
had
they
made
her
a
present
of
them
she
gave
a
sudden
shrill
cry
that
startled
them
and
made
them
look
wildly
for
the
door
but
she
had
done
no
more
than
command
a
and
the
punkah
began
to
swing
rhythmically
overhead
adding
if
that
were
possible
to
the
mesmeric
spell
now
she
said
i
will
tell
a
little
of
the
why
of
things
and
colonel
kirby
hoped
it
was
the
punkah
and
not
funk
that
made
the
sweat
stream
down
his
neck
until
his
collar
was
a
mere
uncomfortable
mess
for
more
than
a
year
there
has
been
much
talk
in
india
the
winds
have
brought
it
all
to
me
there
was
talk
and
the
government
has
known
it
for
i
am
one
of
those
who
told
the
government
of
a
ripe
time
for
a
blow
for
independence
there
have
been
agents
of
another
power
pretending
to
be
merchants
who
have
sown
their
seed
carefully
in
the
bazaars
and
then
there
went
natives
in
the
pay
of
the
merchants
who
had
word
with
native
sowars
saying
that
it
is
not
well
to
be
carried
over
sea
to
fight
quarrels
all
this
the
government
knew
though
of
course
thou
art
not
the
government
but
only
a
soldier
with
a
ready
pistol
and
a
dull
wit
what
bearing
has
this
on
ranjoor
singh
asked
kirby
it
was
so
long
since
he
had
been
spoken
to
so
bluntly
that
he
could
not
sit
still
under
it
i
am
explaining
why
the
colonel
sahib
shall
beg
for
his
ranjoor
singh
she
smiled
does
the
fire
burn
yet
i
wonder
she
struck
a
gong
and
a
maid
appeared
in
the
door
like
an
instant
echo
does
the
fire
still
burn
she
asked
the
maid
disappeared
and
was
gone
five
minutes
during
which
kirby
and
warrington
sat
in
silent
wonder
they
wondered
chiefly
what
the
regiment
would
say
if
it
knew
and
whether
the
regiment
would
ever
know
then
the
maid
came
back
it
burns
she
said
i
can
see
flame
from
the
roof
though
not
so
much
flame
so
said
yasmini
listen
sahibs
it
is
doubtful
if
a
trumpet
could
have
summoned
them
away
for
she
had
them
bound
in
her
spells
and
each
in
a
different
spell
as
her
way
is
she
had
little
need
to
order
them
to
listen
the
talk
in
the
bazaars
did
little
harm
for
the
fat
know
well
whose
rule
has
given
them
their
pickings
they
talk
for
the
love
of
words
but
they
trade
for
the
love
of
money
and
the
government
protects
their
money
nay
it
was
not
the
who
mattered
but
there
came
a
day
when
the
rings
of
talk
had
reached
the
hills
and
hillmen
came
to
delhi
to
hear
more
as
they
ever
have
come
since
india
was
india
and
it
was
clear
then
to
the
government
that
proof
of
disloyalty
among
the
native
regiments
would
set
the
hillmen
screaming
for
a
holy
the
hills
are
cold
sahibs
and
the
hillmen
have
cold
hearts
and
are
quick
to
take
advantage
even
as
i
am
of
embarrassment
hillmen
have
no
mercy
colonel
sahib
i
was
weaned
amid
the
hills
it
seemed
to
kirby
and
warrington
both
for
not
all
their
wits
were
stupefied
that
she
was
sparring
for
time
and
then
warrington
saw
a
face
reflected
in
one
of
the
mirrors
and
nudged
kirby
and
kirby
saw
it
too
they
both
saw
that
she
was
watching
it
it
was
a
fat
face
and
it
looked
terrified
but
the
lips
did
not
move
and
only
the
eyes
had
expression
in
a
moment
a
curtain
seemed
to
be
drawn
in
front
of
it
and
yasmini
took
up
her
tale
and
then
sahibs
as
i
have
told
already
there
came
a
wind
that
whistled
about
war
and
it
pleased
the
government
to
know
which
if
any
of
the
native
regiments
had
been
affected
by
the
talk
so
a
closer
watch
was
set
then
a
net
was
drawn
and
ranjoor
singh
ran
into
the
net
an
antelope
might
blunder
into
a
net
set
for
a
tiger
said
kirby
i
am
here
to
cut
him
out
again
yasmini
laughed
with
pistols
to
shoot
the
cobras
and
sweat
to
put
out
flame
nay
what
is
there
to
cut
but
the
dark
that
closes
up
again
sahib
thou
shalt
for
ranjoor
singh
who
struck
a
hillman
in
my
house
he
was
so
eager
to
hear
treason
ranjoor
singh
honor
and
mine
are
one
said
colonel
kirby
using
a
native
phrase
that
admits
of
no
double
meaning
and
for
a
second
yasmini
stared
at
him
in
doubt
she
had
heard
that
phrase
used
often
to
express
native
regard
for
a
native
or
for
an
englishman
but
never
before
by
an
englishman
for
a
native
then
beg
for
him
she
grinned
mischievously
aye
i
know
the
tale
it
is
the
eve
of
war
and
he
commands
a
squadron
and
there
is
need
of
him
is
it
not
so
yet
the
house
that
he
entered
burns
and
the
hillman
knife
is
long
and
keen
sahib
beg
for
him
kirby
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
warrington
followed
suit
was
returning
and
she
must
have
known
it
perhaps
she
even
intended
that
it
should
but
she
lay
curled
on
the
divan
laughing
up
at
him
and
perfectly
unimpressed
by
his
recovered
dignity
if
he
alive
and
you
know
where
he
is
said
kirby
i
will
pay
you
your
price
name
it
beg
for
him
there
is
no
other
price
the
burns
beg
for
him
now
the
colonel
of
a
regiment
of
light
cavalry
is
so
little
given
to
beg
for
things
that
the
word
beg
has
almost
lapsed
out
of
his
vocabulary
from
desuetude
i
beg
you
to
tell
me
where
he
is
he
said
stiffly
and
she
clapped
her
hands
and
laughed
with
such
delight
that
he
blushed
to
his
ears
again
i
have
had
a
prince
on
his
knees
to
me
and
many
a
priest
she
chuckled
aye
and
many
a
soldier
but
never
yet
a
british
colonel
sahib
kneel
and
beg
why
what
what
d
mean
demanded
kirby
is
his
honor
not
your
honor
i
have
heard
it
said
then
beg
colonel
sahib
on
your
knees
on
those
stiff
british
knees
beg
for
the
honor
of
ranjoor
singh
mean
mean
beg
for
his
honor
and
beg
for
his
life
on
your
knees
colonel
sahib
i
could
look
the
other
way
sir
whispered
warrington
for
the
regiment
need
was
very
real
nay
both
of
you
ye
shall
both
beg
said
yasmini
or
ranjoor
singh
shall
taste
a
hillman
mercy
he
shall
die
so
dishonored
that
the
regiment
shall
hang
its
head
in
shame
impossible
said
kirby
his
honor
is
as
good
as
mine
then
beg
for
his
and
thine
on
your
knees
colonel
sahib
then
it
seemed
to
colonel
kirby
that
the
room
began
to
swim
for
what
with
the
heat
and
what
with
an
unconquerable
dread
of
snakes
he
was
not
in
shape
to
play
his
will
against
this
woman
what
if
i
kneel
he
asked
i
will
promise
you
ranjoor
singh
alive
and
clean
when
in
time
in
time
for
what
against
the
regiment
need
no
use
i
want
him
at
once
said
colonel
kirby
then
go
sahib
put
out
the
fire
with
the
sweat
that
streams
from
thee
nay
go
both
of
you
ye
have
my
leave
to
go
and
what
is
a
sikh
risaldar
more
or
less
nay
go
and
let
the
jat
die
it
is
not
to
be
written
lightly
that
the
british
colonel
of
own
and
his
adjutant
both
knelt
to
a
native
woman
if
she
is
a
native
in
a
top
of
a
delhi
bazaar
but
it
has
to
be
recorded
that
for
the
sake
of
ranjoor
singh
they
did
they
knelt
and
placed
their
foreheads
where
she
bade
them
against
the
divan
at
her
feet
and
she
poured
enough
musk
in
their
hair
for
the
love
of
mischief
to
remind
them
of
what
they
had
done
until
in
the
course
of
slowly
moving
nature
the
smell
should
die
away
and
then
in
a
second
the
lights
went
out
each
blown
by
a
fan
from
behind
the
silken
hangings
they
heard
her
silvery
laugh
and
they
heard
her
spring
to
the
floor
in
cold
creeping
sweat
they
listened
to
footsteps
and
a
little
voice
whispered
in
hindustani
this
way
sahibs
they
followed
since
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
and
their
pride
was
all
gone
to
be
pushed
and
pulled
by
unseen
hands
and
chuckling
girls
down
stairs
that
were
cut
out
of
sheer
blackness
and
at
the
foot
of
the
dark
a
voice
that
warrington
recognized
shed
new
interest
but
no
light
on
the
mystery
salaam
sahibs
said
a
fat
babu
backing
through
a
door
in
front
of
them
and
showing
himself
silhouetted
against
the
lesser
outer
darkness
seeing
regimental
risaldar
on
the
box
seat
i
took
liberty
the
is
sending
this
by
as
yet
unrewarded
messenger
and
word
to
the
effect
that
back
way
out
of
burning
house
was
easier
than
front
way
in
he
sends
salaam
i
am
unrewarded
messenger
he
slipped
something
into
colonel
kirby
hands
and
kirby
struck
a
match
to
examine
it
it
was
ranjoor
singh
ring
that
had
the
regimental
crest
engraved
on
it
not
yet
rewarded
said
the
babu
let
the
strong
take
the
wall
of
the
weak
and
there
plenty
of
room
in
the
dust
let
the
bully
be
brave
but
the
meek
no
more
in
the
way
than
he
must
be
crimson
and
ermine
and
gold
good
lying
and
living
and
mirth
oh
laugh
and
be
fat
the
reward
of
the
bold
but
sotto
voce
the
meek
shall
inherit
the
earth

man
whose
face
was
in
the
mirror
said
warrington
suddenly
reaching
out
to
seize
the
babu
collar
he
the
man
who
wanted
to
be
regimental
clerk
he
the
man
who
was
offering
to
eat
a
german
a
day
no
stand
still
and
i
wo
hurt
you
bring
him
out
into
the
fresh
air
ordered
kirby
the
illimitable
sky
did
not
seem
big
enough
just
then
four
walls
could
not
hold
him
kirby
colonel
of
light
cavalry
and
considered
by
many
the
soundest
man
in
his
profession
was
in
revolt
against
himself
and
his
collar
was
a
beastly
mess
hurry
out
of
this
hole
for
heaven
sake
he
exclaimed
so
warrington
applied
a
little
science
to
the
babu
and
that
gentleman
went
out
through
a
narrow
door
backward
at
a
speed
and
at
an
angle
that
were
new
to
him
so
new
that
he
could
not
express
his
sensations
in
the
form
of
speech
the
door
shut
behind
them
with
a
slam
and
when
they
looked
for
it
they
could
see
no
more
than
a
mark
in
the
wall
about
fifty
yards
from
the
bigger
door
by
which
they
had
originally
entered
there
the
carriage
waiting
sir
said
warrington
and
with
a
glance
toward
it
to
reassure
himself
kirby
opened
his
mouth
wide
and
filled
his
lungs
three
times
with
the
fresh
air
there
were
splashes
of
rain
falling
and
he
stood
with
bared
head
face
upward
as
if
the
rain
would
wash
yasmini
musk
from
him
it
was
nearly
but
warrington
could
just
see
that
the
risaldar
on
the
box
seat
raised
his
whip
to
them
in
token
of
recognition
now
then
speak
my
friend
what
were
you
doing
in
there
demanded
warrington
no
not
here
said
kirby
we
might
be
recognized
bring
him
into
the
shay
the
babu
uttered
no
complaint
but
allowed
himself
to
be
pushed
along
at
a
trot
ahead
of
the
adjutant
and
bundled
through
the
carriage
door
drive
slowly
ordered
kirby
clambering
in
last
and
the
risaldar
sent
the
horses
forward
at
a
steady
trot
now
said
warrington
said
kirby
my
god
gentlemen
said
the
babu
sahibs
i
am
innocent
of
all
complicitee
in
this
or
any
other
eventualitee

am
married
man

family
responsibilitee

other
handicaps
therefore

kirby
that

the
babu
that

connection
ranjoor
singh
who

same

his
property
gave
it
into
my
hand
when
both
men
demanded
to
know
that
in
one
voice
sahibs
having
no
means
of
telling
time
how
can
i
guess
how
long
ago
about

long
ago
being
elderly
person
of
advancing
years
and
much
adipose
tissue
i
am
not
able
to

more
than
one
thing
at

time

many
things

been
forced
on
my
attention
i
do

how
long
ago
since
i
saw
you
outside
the
barrack
gate
demanded
warrington
oh
yes
oh
certainly
by
all
means
less
than
two
hours
ago
then
sir
said
warrington
looking
at
his
watch
then
he

burned
to
death
said
kirby
with
more
satisfaction
than
he
had
expressed
all
the
evening

demanded
warrington
they
sahib

asked
kirby
the
men
who

investigate
the
inside
of
my
belly
sahib
oh

belly

so
sensitive
i
am
afraid
did
he
tell
you
who
were
no
sahib
had
he
done
so
i
would
at
once
have
sought
police
protection
not
knowing
names
of
individuals
what
was
use
of
going
to
police
who
would
laugh
at
me
i
went
to
yasmini
who
understands
all
things
she
laughed
too
but
she
told
me
where
is
colonel
kirby
sahib
colonel
kirby
became
possessed
of
a
bright
idea
his
first
since
yasmini
had
thrown
her
spell
over
him
could
you
find
the
way
he
asked
from
here
to
wherever
it
was
that
ranjoor
singh
gave
you
that
ring
the
babu
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
gazed
into
the
dark
for
several
minutes
conceivablee
yes
sahib
then
tell
the
driver
where
to
turn
i
could
direct
with
more
discernment
from
said
the
babu
with
a
hand
on
the
door
no
you
do
commanded
warrington
let
go
that
handle
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
were
you
so
afraid
at
yasmini
i
sahib
yes
you
i
saw
your
face
in
a
mirror
and
you
were
scared
nearly
to
death
of
what
who
is
not
afraid
of
yasmini
were
the
sahibs
not
also
afraid
of
what
besides
yasmini
were
you
afraid
of
what
in
particular
of
her
cobras
sahib
what
of
them
demanded
warrington
with
a
reminiscent
shudder
certain
of
her
women
showed
them
to
me
why
to
further
convince
me
sahib
had
that
been
necessary
oh
but
i
was
already
quite
convinced
bravery
is
not
my
mecum
confound
the
man
to
convince
you
of
what
that
if
i
tell
too
much
one
of
those
snakes
will
shortlee
be
my
bedmate
ah
to
think
of
it
causes
me
to
perspirate
with
sweat
sahibs
that
is
a
you
shall
go
to
jail
if
you
do
tell
me
what
i
want
to
know
said
kirby
ah
sahib
i
was
jail
clerk
once
dismissed
for
minor
offenses
but
cumulative
in
effect
being
familiar
with
inside
of
jail
am
able
to
make
choice
get
on
the
with
him
commanded
kirby
let
him
show
the
driver
where
to
turn
but
watch
him
keep
hold
of
him
so
again
the
babu
was
propelled
on
an
involuntary
course
and
warrington
proceeded
to
pinch
certain
of
his
fat
parts
to
encourage
him
to
mount
the
box
with
greater
speed
but
his
helplessness
became
so
obvious
that
warrington
turned
friend
and
shoved
him
up
at
last
keeping
hold
of
his
when
he
wedged
his
own
muscular
anatomy
into
the
small
space
left
to
the
right
said
the
babu
pointing
and
the
risaldar
drove
to
the
right
to
the
left
said
the
babu
and
warrington
made
note
of
the
fact
that
they
were
not
so
very
far
away
from
the
soon
the
babu
began
to
scratch
his
stomach
what
the
matter
demanded
warrington
they
said
they
would
cut
my
belly
open
sahib
a
belly
is
so
sensitive
warrington
laughed
sympathetically
for
the
fear
was
genuine
and
candidly
expressed
the
babu
continued
scratching
to
the
right
he
said
after
a
while
and
the
risaldar
drove
to
the
right
toward
where
a
hindu
temple
cast
deep
shadows
and
a
row
of
trees
stood
sentry
in
spasmodic
moonlight
in
front
of
the
temple
seated
on
a
mat
was
a
wandering
fakir
of
the
type
by
his
side
was
a
flat
covered
basket
look
sahib
said
the
babu
and
warrington
looked
my
belly
crawls
what
the
matter
man
he
is
a
fakir
there
are
snakes
in
that
basket
cobras
sahib
warrington
swaying
precariously
over
the
edge
held
tight
by
the
depending
on
it
as
a
yacht
in
a
tideway
would
to
three
hundred
pounds
of
iron
oh
cobras
are
so
veree
dreadful
creatures
wailed
the
babu
caressing
his
waist
again
look
sahib
look
oh
look
between
devil
and
what
should
a
man
do
ow
the
carriage
lurched
at
a
the
babu
weight
lurched
with
it
and
warrington
center
of
gravity
shifted
the
babu
seemed
to
shrug
himself
away
from
the
snakes
but
the
effect
was
to
shove
warrington
the
odd
it
needed
to
put
him
overside
he
clung
to
the
and
pulled
hard
to
haul
himself
back
again
and
the
came
away
halt
yelled
warrington
and
the
risaldar
reined
in
but
the
horses
took
fright
and
plunged
forward
though
the
risaldar
swore
afterward
that
the
babu
did
nothing
to
them
he
supposed
it
must
have
been
the
fakir
squatting
in
the
shadows
that
scared
them
and
whatever
it
may
have
been
snakes
or
not
that
had
scared
the
babu
it
had
scared
all
his
helplessness
away
naked
from
shirt
to
socks
he
rolled
like
a
big
ball
backward
over
the
carriage
top
fell
to
earth
behind
the
carriage
bumped
into
warrington
who
was
struggling
to
his
feet
knocking
him
down
again
and
departed
for
the
temple
shadows
screaming
the
temple
door
slammed
just
as
warrington
started
after
him
by
that
time
the
risaldar
had
got
the
horses
stopped
and
colonel
kirby
realized
what
had
happened
come
back
warrington
he
ordered
peremptorily
warrington
obeyed
but
without
enthusiasm
i
can
run
faster
than
that
fat
brute
sir
he
said
and
i
saw
him
go
into
the
temple
we
wo
find
ranjoor
singh
now
in
a
month
of
sundays
he
was
trying
to
wipe
the
mud
from
himself
with
the
aid
of
the
anyhow
i
got
the
most
important
part
of
his
costume
he
said
vindictively
gad
i
like
to
get
him
on
the
run
now
through
the
public
street
come
along
in
commanded
kirby
opening
the
door
there
has
been
trouble
enough
already
without
a
charge
of
temple
breaking
tell
the
risaldar
to
drive
back
to
quarters
i
going
to
get
this
musk
out
of
my
hair
before
dawn
warrington
sniffed
as
he
climbed
in
the
outer
night
had
given
him
at
least
a
standard
by
which
to
judge
things
i
give
something
to
listen
to
the
first
man
who
smells
the
inside
of
this
shay
he
said
cheerily
d
suppose
we
can
blame
it
on
the
babu
sir
we
can
try
said
kirby
is
that
his
you
got
still
did
propose
to
leave
it
in
the
road
for
him
to
come
and
find
sir
his
present
shame
is
about
the
only
consolation
prize
we
get
out
of
the
evening
sport
i
wish
it
smelt
of
musk
but
it
does
it
smells
of
babu
straight
babu
undiluted
hallo
what
this
he
began
to
untwist
a
corner
of
the
cloth
holding
it
up
to
get
a
better
view
of
it
in
the
dim
light
that
entered
through
the
window
he
produced
a
piece
of
paper
that
had
to
be
untwisted
too
got
a
match
sir
kirby
struck
one
it
addressed
to
kirby
sahib
bet
you
it
from
ranjoor
singh
now
suppose
that
heathen
meant
to
hold
on
to
that
until
he
could
get
his
price
for
it
dunno
said
kirby
with
indifference
opening
the
note
as
fast
as
trembling
fingers
could
unfold
it
he
would
not
have
admitted
to
himself
what
his
fingers
told
so
plainly
the
extent
of
his
regard
for
ranjoor
singh
the
note
was
short
and
kirby
read
it
aloud
since
it
was
not
marked
private
and
there
was
nothing
in
it
that
even
the
babu
might
not
have
read
to
colonel
kirby
sahib
from
his
obedient
servant
ranjoor
singh
leave
of
absence
being
out
of
question
after
declaration
of
war
will
colonel
kirby
sahib
please
put
in
order
of
the
day
that
ranjoor
singh
is
assigned
to
special
duty
or
words
to
same
effect
is
that
all
asked
warrington
that
all
said
kirby
suppose
it
a
forgery
the
ring
rather
proves
it
is
and
i
another
way
of
knowing
oh
yes
said
kirby
they
sat
in
silence
in
the
swaying
shay
until
the
smell
of
musk
and
the
sense
of
being
mystified
became
too
much
for
warrington
and
he
began
to
hum
to
himself
humming
brought
about
a
return
to
his
usual
and
he
began
to
notice
things
shay
rides
like
a
gun
he
said
suddenly
kirby
grunted
all
the
weight
behind
and
he
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
to
investigate
but
kirby
ordered
him
to
sit
still
want
to
be
recognized
he
demanded
keep
your
head
inside
you
young
ass
so
warrington
sat
back
against
the
cushions
until
the
guard
at
the
barrack
gate
turned
out
to
present
arms
to
the
risaldar
raised
whip
as
if
he
understood
the
requirements
of
the
occasion
without
being
told
the
risaldar
sent
the
horses
up
the
drive
at
a
hard
gallop
it
was
rather
more
than
up
the
drive
that
warrington
spoke
again
feel
that
sir
he
asked
i
ordered
that
place
to
be
seen
to
yesterday
growled
kirby
why
was
it
done
it
was
sir
why
did
we
bump
there
then
why
are
we
running
like
a
gun
any
longer
wondered
warrington
felt
to
me
as
if
we
dropped
a
load
well
here
we
are
thank
god
what
do
you
mean
to
do
rounds
said
warrington
very
well
kirby
dived
through
his
door
while
warrington
went
behind
the
shay
to
have
a
good
look
for
causes
he
could
find
none
although
a
black
leather
apron
usually
rolled
up
behind
in
order
to
be
strapped
over
baggage
when
required
was
missing
did
see
who
took
that
apron
did
you
he
asked
the
risaldar
but
the
risaldar
had
not
known
that
it
was
gone
all
right
then
and
thank
you
said
warrington
walking
off
into
the
darkness
bareheaded
to
help
the
smell
evaporate
from
his
hair
and
the
shay
rumbled
away
to
its
appointed
place
with
the
babu
inside
it
on
the
front
seat
it
need
surprise
nobody
that
colonel
kirby
found
time
first
to
go
to
his
bathroom
his
regiment
was
as
ready
for
active
service
at
any
minute
as
a
should
be
in
that
particular
india
speed
is
as
three
to
prussia
one
the
moment
orders
to
march
should
come
he
would
parade
it
in
full
marching
order
and
lead
it
away
but
there
were
no
orders
yet
he
had
merely
had
warning
so
he
sent
for
and
a
brush
and
proceeded
to
scour
his
head
after
twenty
minutes
of
it
and
ten
changes
of
water
when
he
felt
that
he
dared
face
his
own
servant
without
blushing
he
made
that
wondering
sikh
take
turns
at
shampooing
him
until
he
could
endure
the
friction
no
longer
what
does
my
head
smell
of
now
he
demanded
musk
sahib
not
of
no
sahib
bring
that
carbolic
disinfectant
here
the
servant
obeyed
and
kirby
mixed
a
lotion
that
would
outsmell
most
things
he
laved
his
head
in
it
generously
and
washed
it
off
sparingly
bring
me
brown
paper
he
ordered
then
and
again
the
sikh
obeyed
kirby
rolled
the
paper
into
torches
and
giving
the
servant
one
proceeded
to
fumigate
the
room
and
his
own
person
until
not
even
a
bloodhound
could
have
tracked
him
back
to
yasmini
and
the
reek
of
musk
had
been
temporarily
at
least
subdued
into
quiescence
go
and
ask
major
brammle
to
come
and
see
me
said
kirby
then
brammle
came
in
sniffing
and
kirby
cursed
him
through
tight
lips
with
words
that
were
no
less
fervent
for
lack
of
being
heard
hallo
burning
the
whole
mess
is
doin
the
same
thing
have
had
time
to
burn
mine
yet
was
busy
sorting
things
over
when
you
called
look
here
he
opened
the
front
of
his
and
produced
a
little
lace
handkerchief
a
glove
and
a
smell
he
said
patchouli
shame
to
burn
what
i
must
though
any
thing
happen
while
i
was
gone
asked
kirby
yes
most
extraordinary
thing
you
know
that
a
few
hours
ago
d
squadron
were
all
sitting
about
in
groups
looking
miserable
we
set
it
down
to
their
trooper
being
murdered
and
another
man
being
missing
well
just
about
the
time
you
and
warrington
drove
off
in
the
mess
shay
they
all
bucked
up
and
began
grinning
would
say
a
word
just
grinned
and
became
the
perkiest
squadron
of
the
lot
now
they
all
sleeping
like
reason
not
a
word
of
reason
i
saw
young
warrington
just
now
on
his
way
to
their
quarters
with
a
lantern
and
if
he
can
find
any
of
awake
perhaps
he
can
get
the
truth
out
of
for
they
talk
to
him
when
they
wo
to
anybody
else
by
the
way
warrington
ca
have
come
in
with
you
did
he
kirby
ignored
the
question
did
you
tell
warrington
to
go
and
ask
them
he
demanded
yes
passed
him
in
the
dark
but
did
not
recognize
him
by
the
smell
no
no
got
as
near
him
as
i
could
and
then
leaned
up
against
the
scent
to
have
a
word
with
him
musk
never
smelt
anything
like
it
in
my
life
talk
about
girls
he
must
be
in
love
with
half
india
and
native
at
that
young
monkey
i
asked
him
where
he
got
the
disinfectant
and
he
told
me
he
fell
into
a
perhaps
he
did
said
kirby
was
there
mud
on
him
could
see
did
dare
get
so
near
him
do
you
think
he
ought
to
be
spoken
to
i
mean
the
eve
of
war
the
eve
of
war
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
but
i
wish
you
let
me
see
the
orders
of
the
day
kirby
interrupted
i
want
to
make
an
addition
to
them
i
send
an
orderly
wish
you
would
five
minutes
later
kirby
sat
at
his
private
desk
while
brammle
puffed
at
a
cigar
by
the
window
kirby
after
a
lot
of
thinking
wrote
ranjoor
singh
d
squadron
assigned
to
special
duty
he
handed
the
orders
back
to
brammle
and
the
major
eyed
the
addition
with
subdued
amazement
what
d
squadron
say
he
asked
remains
to
be
seen
said
kirby
outside
in
the
muggy
blackness
that
shuts
down
on
india
in
the
rains
warrington
walked
alone
swinging
a
lantern
and
chuckling
to
himself
as
he
reflected
what
d
squadron
would
be
likely
to
invent
as
a
reason
for
the
smell
that
walked
with
him
for
he
meant
to
wake
d
squadron
and
learn
things
but
all
at
once
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
left
the
on
the
inside
front
seat
of
the
shay
and
because
if
that
were
seen
it
would
have
given
excuse
for
a
thousand
tales
too
many
and
too
imaginative
he
hurried
in
search
of
it
taking
a
short
cut
to
where
by
that
time
the
shay
should
be
on
his
way
close
to
his
destination
he
stumbled
over
something
soft
that
tripped
him
he
stooped
swung
the
lantern
forward
and
picked
up
the
missing
leather
apron
from
behind
the
shay
the
footpath
on
which
he
stood
was
about
a
yard
wide
the
shay
could
not
possibly
have
come
along
it
and
it
certainly
had
been
behind
the
shay
when
they
left
barracks
moreover
close
examination
proved
it
to
be
the
identical
apron
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
warrington
began
to
hum
to
himself
and
then
he
ceased
from
humming
then
he
set
the
lantern
down
and
stepped
away
from
it
sidewise
until
its
light
no
longer
shone
on
him
he
listened
as
a
dog
does
with
intelligence
and
skill
then
suddenly
he
sprang
and
lit
on
a
bulky
mass
that
yielded
gasped
spluttered
did
anything
but
yell
so
you
rode
on
the
behind
the
carriage
did
you
he
smiled
and
curled
under
the
apron
to
look
like
luggage
when
we
passed
the
guard
eh
but
my
god
sahib
said
a
plaintive
voice
should
i
walk
through
delhi
naked
you
who
wear
pants
you
laugh
at
me
but
i
assure
you
sahib
hush
ordered
warrington
and
the
babu
seemed
very
glad
to
hush
there
was
a
note
in
a
corner
of
that
cloth
of
yours
and
the
sahib
found
it
oh
then
i
am
relieved
i
am
preserved
from
pangs
of
mutual
regret
why
did
you
give
that
note
to
colonel
kirby
sahib
when
you
had
the
chance
eh
asked
warrington
keeping
firm
hold
of
him
sahib
your
honor
not
being
yet
remunerated
on
account
of
ring
and
verbal
message
duly
delivered
commercial
precedent
was
all
on
my
side
that
i
should
retain
further
article
of
value
pending
settlement
now
i
ask
you
where
was
ranjoor
singh
when
he
gave
you
that
ring
and
message
demanded
warrington
sternly
increasing
his
grip
on
the
babu
fat
arm
sahib
when
i
have
received
payment
for
first
service
rendered
my
disposition
may
be
changed
i
am
as
yet
in
condition
of
still
holding
him
tight
warrington
produced
twenty
rupees
in
paper
money
can
you
see
those
see
them
then
earn
them
oh
my
god
sahib
i
have
positivelee
earned
a
lakh
of
rupees
this
night
already
where
was
ranjoor
singh
when
he
footsteps
were
approaching
undoubtedly
a
guard
on
his
way
to
investigate
the
babu
seemed
to
sense
warrington
impatience
sahib
he
said
i
am
very
meek
person
having
family
of
wife
and
children
all
dependent
is
that
rupees
twenty
i
would
graciously
accept
same
and
positivelee
hold
my
tongue
the
steps
came
nearer
i
was
on
my
way
to
d
squadron
quarters
sahib
to
narrate
story
and
pass
begging
bowl
total
price
of
story
rupees
twenty
or
else
the
sahib
may
deliver
me
to
guard
and
guard
shall
be
regaled
free
gratis
with
full
account
of
evening
amusement
yes
the
steps
came
nearer
yet
recognizing
an
officer
the
men
halted
a
few
paces
away
sahib
for
sum
of
rupees
twenty
i
could
hold
tongue
for
twenty
years
unless
in
meantime
deceased
in
which
case
take
ordered
warrington
and
the
babu
fingers
shut
tight
on
the
money
guard
ordered
warrington
put
this
babu
out
into
the
street
good
night
sahib
said
the
babu
kindlee
present
my
serious
respects
to
the
colonel
sahib
salaam
sahib
but
warrington
had
gone
into
the
darkness
the
four
winds
come
the
four
winds
go
ye
wise
o
the
world
oh
listen
ye
whispering
whistling
what
they
know
wise
since
wandering
made
them
so
ye
oh
listen
ye
ever
they
seek
and
sift
and
pry
listening
here
and
hurrying
by
restless
ceaseless
know
ye
why
then
wise
o
the
world
oh
listen
ye
the
goal
of
the
search
of
the
hurrying
wind
is
the
key
to
the
maze
of
a
woman
mind
and
there
is
no
key
oh
listen
ye
yasmini
song
chapter
viii
so
in
a
darkness
that
grew
blacker
every
minute
warrington
swung
his
lantern
and
found
his
way
toward
d
squadron
quarters
he
felt
rather
pleased
with
himself
from
his
own
point
of
view
he
would
have
rather
enjoyed
to
have
a
story
anent
himself
and
yasmini
go
the
round
of
barracks
with
modifications
of
course
and
the
kneeling
part
left
out
but
he
realized
that
it
would
not
do
at
all
to
have
colonel
kirby
name
involved
in
anything
of
the
sort
and
he
rather
flattered
himself
on
his
tact
in
bribing
the
babu
or
being
blackmailed
by
him
got
to
admit
that
babu
quite
a
huntsman
he
told
himself
beginning
to
hum
one
day
if
the
war
does
account
for
me
i
come
back
and
take
a
fall
out
of
that
babu
hallo
what
that
who
in
thunder
waking
up
the
horses
at
this
unearthly
hour
sick
horse
i
suppose
why
do
they
get
him
out
and
let
the
others
sleep
he
began
to
hurry
a
light
in
stables
close
to
midnight
was
not
to
be
accounted
for
on
any
other
supposition
than
an
accident
or
serious
emergency
and
if
there
were
either
it
was
his
affair
as
adjutant
to
know
all
the
facts
at
once
what
going
on
in
there
he
shouted
in
a
voice
of
authority
while
he
was
yet
twenty
yards
away
but
there
was
no
answer
he
could
hear
a
horse
plunge
but
nothing
more
horse
cast
himself
he
straightway
decided
but
there
was
no
cast
horse
as
he
was
aware
the
moment
he
had
looked
down
both
long
lines
of
sleepy
brutes
that
whickered
their
protest
against
interrupted
sleep
at
the
far
end
he
could
see
that
two
men
labored
and
a
big
horse
fiercely
resented
their
unseasonable
attentions
to
himself
he
walked
down
the
length
of
the
stable
and
presently
recognized
bagh
ranjoor
singh
charger
what
are
you
grooming
him
for
at
this
hour
he
demanded
it
is
an
order
sahib
whose
order
ranjoor
singh
sahib
order
the
deuce
it
is
when
did
the
order
come
but
now
who
brought
it
a
babu
with
a
leather
apron
warrington
walked
away
ten
paces
in
order
to
get
command
of
himself
and
pinch
himself
and
make
quite
sure
he
was
awake
a
fat
babu
he
asked
walking
back
again
very
fat
said
one
of
the
troopers
continuing
to
brush
the
resentful
charger
so
he
delivered
his
message
first
and
then
went
to
hunt
for
his
mused
warrington
and
he
had
enough
intuition
and
guts
enough
to
look
for
it
first
in
the
shay
i
beginning
to
admire
that
man
aloud
he
asked
the
trooper
what
was
the
wording
of
the
sahib
message
bagh
be
well
groomed
and
held
ready
against
all
contingencies
said
the
trooper
then
take
him
outside
ordered
warrington
groom
him
where
you
disturb
the
other
horses
how
often
have
you
got
to
be
told
that
a
horse
needs
sleep
as
much
as
a
man
the
squadron
wo
be
fit
to
march
a
mile
if
you
keep
awake
all
night
lead
him
out
quietly
now
whoa
you
brute
now
take
him
out
and
keep
him
out
put
him
in
the
end
stall
in
my
stable
when
you
finished
him
hear
he
flattered
himself
again
with
all
these
mysterious
messages
and
orders
coming
in
from
nowhere
he
told
himself
it
would
be
good
to
know
at
all
times
where
ranjoor
singh
charger
was
as
well
as
a
service
to
ranjoor
singh
to
stable
the
brute
comfortably
he
told
himself
that
was
a
very
smart
move
and
one
for
which
ranjoor
singh
would
some
day
thank
him
provided
of
course
that
provided
what
he
wondered
half
aloud
seems
to
me
as
if
ranjoor
singh
has
got
himself
into
some
kind
of
a
scrape
and
hopes
to
get
out
of
it
by
the
route
and
no
questions
asked
well
let
hope
he
gets
out
let
hope
there
be
no
nastiness
hope
oh
damn
just
hoping
ranjoor
singh
a
better
man
than
i
am
here
believing
in
him
here
to
him
thick
and
thin
forward
walk
march
he
turned
out
the
guard
and
the
particular
troop
sergeant
with
whom
he
wished
to
speak
not
being
on
duty
he
ordered
him
sent
for
ten
minutes
later
the
sergeant
came
still
yawning
from
his
cot
come
over
here
arjan
singh
he
called
thinking
fast
and
furiously
as
he
led
the
way
if
he
made
one
false
move
or
aroused
one
suspicion
in
the
man
mind
he
was
likely
to
learn
less
than
nothing
but
if
he
did
not
appear
to
know
at
least
something
he
would
probably
learn
nothing
either
as
he
turned
at
a
distance
from
the
light
to
face
the
sergeant
though
not
to
meet
his
eyes
too
keenly
the
fact
that
would
not
keep
out
of
his
brain
was
that
the
fat
babu
had
been
out
in
the
road
offering
to
eat
germans
a
little
while
before
he
and
the
colonel
had
started
out
that
evening
and
according
to
what
brammle
had
told
him
when
they
met
near
the
colonel
quarters
it
was
very
shortly
after
that
that
the
squadron
came
out
of
its
gloom
what
was
the
first
message
that
the
babu
brought
this
evening
he
asked
still
being
very
careful
not
to
look
into
the
sergeant
eyes
he
spoke
as
comrade
to
comrade
servant
of
the
salt
to
servant
of
the
salt
which
babu
sahib
asked
arjan
singh
unblinking
now
in
all
probability
this
man
since
he
had
been
asleep
knew
nothing
about
the
message
to
groom
bagh
to
have
answered
the
babu
who
spoke
about
the
charger
might
have
been
a
serious
mistake
arjan
singh
look
me
in
the
eyes
he
ordered
and
the
sikh
obeyed
he
was
taller
than
warrington
and
looked
down
on
him
are
you
a
true
friend
of
the
may
i
die
sahib
if
i
am
not
and
i
what
of
me
am
i
his
friend
or
his
enemy
the
sergeant
hesitated
can
i
read
men
hearts
he
asked
yes
said
warrington
and
so
can
i
that
is
why
i
had
you
called
from
your
sleep
i
sent
for
you
to
learn
the
truth
what
was
the
message
given
by
the
fat
babu
to
one
of
the
guard
by
the
outer
gate
this
evening
and
delivered
by
him
or
by
some
other
man
to
d
squadron
sahib
it
was
not
a
written
message
repeat
it
to
me
sahib
it
was
verbal
i
can
not
remember
it
arjan
singh
you
lie
did
i
ever
lie
to
you
did
i
ever
threaten
you
and
not
carry
out
my
threats
promise
you
and
not
keep
my
promise
i
am
a
soldier
are
you
a
cur
god
forbid
sahib
i
arjan
singh
repeat
that
message
to
me
word
for
word
please
not
as
a
favor
nor
as
obeying
an
order
but
as
a
friend
of
ranjoor
singh
to
a
friend
of
ranjoor
singh
the
message
was
to
the
squadron
not
to
me
sahib
are
you
not
of
the
squadron
make
it
an
order
sahib
certainly
not
nor
a
favor
either
sahib
i
nor
will
i
threaten
you
i
guarantee
you
absolute
immunity
if
you
refuse
to
repeat
it
my
word
on
it
i
am
ranjoor
singh
friend
and
i
ask
of
his
friend
the
babu
said
ranjoor
singh
let
the
squadron
be
on
its
best
behavior
let
the
squadron
know
that
surely
before
the
blood
runs
he
will
be
there
to
lead
it
wherever
it
is
meanwhile
let
the
squadron
be
worthy
of
its
salt
and
of
its
officers
was
that
all
asked
warrington
all
sahib
may
my
tongue
rot
if
i
lie
thank
you
arjan
singh
that
all
you
need
mention
our
conversation
good
night
fooled
chuckled
warrington
she
fooled
us
to
the
limit
of
our
special
bent
and
i
take
it
that
he
hurried
away
toward
colonel
kirby
quarters
swinging
his
lantern
and
humming
to
himself
and
this
is
the
arabian
nights
he
told
himself
delhi
twentieth
century
gad
would
the
whole
confounded
army
rock
with
laughter
then
he
stopped
chuckling
to
hurry
faster
for
a
giant
horn
had
rooted
chunks
out
of
the
blackness
by
the
barrack
gate
and
now
what
sounded
like
a
racing
car
was
tearing
up
the
drive
the
dazzled
him
but
he
ran
and
reached
the
colonel
porch
breathless
he
was
admitted
at
once
and
found
the
colonel
and
brammle
together
facing
an
in
the
colonel
hand
was
a
sealed
envelope
shall
i
repeat
it
sir
asked
the
yes
if
you
think
it
necessary
answered
kirby
the
sealed
orders
are
not
to
be
opened
until
out
at
sea
you
are
expected
to
parade
at
dawn
the
day
after
and
there
will
be
somebody
from
headquarters
to
act
as
guide
for
the
occasion
in
fact
you
will
be
guided
at
each
point
until
it
is
time
to
open

be
given
about
anything
until
later
on
all
good
night
sir
and
good
luck
the
held
out
his
hand
and
colonel
kirby
shook
it
a
trifle
perfunctorily
he
was
not
much
given
to
display
of
sentiment
the
saluted
and
a
minute
later
the
giant
car
spurned
the
gravel
out
from
under
its
rear
wheels
as
it
started
off
to
warn
another
regiment
so
we
got
our
route
said
kirby
and
thank
god
we
take
our
own
horses
said
brammle
fervently
bet
you
a
thousand
the
other
end
marseilles
said
warrington
we
in
luck
they
have
mounted
us
on
if
we
brought
our
own
we
have
had
to
ring
a
bell
to
start
and
stop
a
squadron
who
would
be
light
cavalry
kirby
put
the
sealed
letter
in
an
inside
pocket
i
going
to
sleep
said
brammle
yawning
night
sir
night
said
kirby
but
warrington
stayed
on
he
went
and
stood
near
the
window
and
when
kirby
had
seen
brammle
to
the
door
he
joined
him
there
what
now
warrington
caught
grooming
ranjoor
singh
charger
in
the
dark
why
said
it
was
an
order
from
ranjoor
singh
i
getting
tired
of
this
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
it
that
is
nearly
the
worst
sir
listen
to
this
long
before
yasmini
promised
us
before
we
knelt
to
save
his
life
and
honor
ranjoor
singh
had
sent
a
message
to
his
squadron
guaranteein
to
be
with
before
the
blood
runs
specific
guarantee
and
no
conditions
then
exactly
sir
she
fooled
us
eh

she
for
or
against
the
government
sir
i
do
know
thank
god

got
our
marching
orders

and
wash
your
head
and
warrington

your
tongue
warrington
held
up
his
right
hand
so
help
me
sir
he
grinned
but
will
she
hold
hers
westward
into
the
hungry
west
oh
listen
wise
men
listen
ye
whirls
the
east
wind
on
his
quest
whimpering
worrying
hurrying
lest
the
light

listen
ye
mark
ye
the
burden
of
his
sigh
westward
sinks
the
sun
to
die
westward
wing
the
vultures
aye
listen
wise
men
listen
ye
the
east
must
lose
the
west
must
gain

to
the
east

though

listen
ye
yasmini
song
chapter
ix
now
india
is
unlike
every
other
country
in
the
world
in
all
particulars
and
delhi
is
in
some
respects
the
very
heart
through
which
india
unusualness
flows
delhi
has
five
railway
stations
with
which
to
cope
with
floods
of
paradoxical
necessity
and
nobody
knew
from
which
railway
station
troops
might
be
expected
to
entrain
or
whither
although
delhi
knew
that
there
was
war
there
did
not
seem
to
be
anything
very
much
out
of
the
ordinary
at
any
of
the
stations
in
india
one
or
two
sidings
are
nearly
always
full
of
empty
trains
there
did
not
seem
to
be
more
of
them
than
usual
at
the
british
barracks
there
was
more
or
less
commotion
because
thomas
atkins
likes
to
voice
his
joy
when
the
long
peace
breaks
at
last
and
he
may
justify
himself
but
in
the
native
lines
where
dignity
is
differently
understood
the
only
men
who
really
seemed
unusually
busy
were
the
farriers
and
the
armourers
who
sharpened
swords
the
government
offices
appeared
to
be
undisturbed
and
certainly
no
more
messengers
ran
about
than
usual
the
only
difference
was
that
one
or
two
of
them
were
open
at
a
very
early
hour
but
even
in
them
and
englishmen
were
busy
in
them
there
seemed
no
excitement
delhi
had
found
time
in
a
night
to
catch
her
breath
and
continue
listening
for
unlike
most
big
cities
that
brag
with
or
without
good
reason
delhi
is
listening
nearly
all
the
time
a
man
was
listening
in
the
dingiest
of
all
the
offices
on
the
ground
floor
of
a
big
building
on
the
side
away
from
the
street
a
man
in
a
drab
silk
suit
who
twisted
a
leather
around
his
thumb
and
untwisted
it
incessantly
there
was
a
telephone
beside
him
and
a
pile
of
telegraph
forms
but
beyond
that
not
much
to
show
what
his
particular
business
might
be
he
did
not
look
aggressive
but
he
seemed
nervous
for
he
jumped
perceptibly
when
the
rang
and
being
a
government
telephone
with
no
commercial
aims
it
did
not
ring
loud
yes
he
said
with
the
receiver
at
his
ear
yes
yes
who
else
oh
i
forgot
for
the
moment
four
three
two
nine
two
give
yours
very
well
i
listening
whoever
was
speaking
at
the
other
end
had
a
lot
to
say
and
none
of
it
can
have
been
expected
for
the
man
in
the
drab
silk
suit
twisted
his
wrinkled
face
and
worked
his
eyes
in
a
hundred
expressions
that
began
with
displeasure
and
passed
through
different
stages
of
surprise
to
acquiescence
i
want
you
to
know
he
said
that
i
got
my
information
at
first
hand
i
got
it
from
yasmini
herself
from
three
of
the
who
were
present
and
from
the
afridi
who
was
kicked
and
beaten
all
except
the
afridi
who
was
there
by
that
time
agreed
that
ranjoor
singh
had
words
with
the
german
afterward
eh
what
that
he
listened
again
for
about
five
minutes
and
then
hung
up
the
receiver
with
an
expression
of
mixed
irritation
and
amusement
caught
me
hopping
on
the
wrong
leg
this
time
he
muttered
beginning
to
twist
at
his
again
presently
he
sat
up
and
looked
bored
for
he
heard
the
fast
trot
of
a
big
horse
a
minute
later
a
high
dogcart
drew
up
in
the
street
and
he
heard
a
man
long
striding
footsteps
coming
round
the
corner
like
horse
like
man
like
regiment
he
muttered
pick
his
stride
or
his
horse
out
of
a
hundred
and
he
pulled
out
his
nickel
watch
he
ten
minutes
earlier
than
i
expected
him
morning
colonel
kirby
he
said
pleasantly
as
kirby
strode
in
helmet
in
hand
take
a
seat
he
noticed
kirby
scalp
was
red
and
that
he
smelt
more
than
faintly
of
carbolic
morning
said
kirby
i
wondering
what
brought
you
said
the
man
in
drab
i
come
about
ranjoor
singh
said
kirby
and
the
man
in
drab
tried
to
look
surprised
what
about
him
reconsidered
yesterday
decision
no
said
kirby
i
come
to
ask
what
news
you
have
of
him
and
kirby
eye
that
some
men
seemed
to
think
so
like
a
bird
transfixed
the
man
in
drab
so
that
he
squirmed
as
if
he
had
been
impaled
you
must
understand
colonel
kirby
in
fact
i
sure
you
do
understand
that
my
business
does
admit
of
confidences
even
if
i
wanted
to
divulge
information
i
not
allowed
to
i
stretched
a
point
yesterday
when
i
confided
in
you
my
suspicions
regarding
ranjoor
singh
but
that
does
imply
that
i
going
to
tell
you
all
i
know
i
asked
you
what
knew
you
may
remember
i
told
you
snapped
kirby
is
ranjoor
singh
still
under
suspicion
that
was
a
straight
question
of
the
true
kirby
type
that
admitted
of
no
evasion
and
the
man
in
drab
pulled
his
watch
out
knocking
it
on
the
desk
as
if
it
were
an
egg
that
he
wished
to
crack
he
must
either
answer
or
not
it
seemed
so
he
did
neither
why
do
you
ask
he
parried
i
a
right
to
know
ranjoor
singh
my
wing
commander
and
a
better
officer
or
a
more
loyal
gentleman
does
exist
i
want
him
i
want
to
know
where
he
is
and
if
he
under
a
cloud
i
want
to
know
why
where
is
he
i
do
know
where
he
is
said
the
man
in
drab
is
he
ah
absent
without
leave
certainly
not
said
kirby
i
seen
to
that
then
you
communicated
with
him
no
then
if
his
regiment
were
to
march
without
him
it
wo
if
i
can
help
it
said
kirby
and
if
you
ca
help
it
colonel
kirby
in
that
case
he
has
got
what
he
asked
for
and
there
can
be
no
charge
against
him
until
he
shows
up
i
understand
you
have
your
marching
orders
i
have
sealed
orders
snapped
kirby
to
be
opened
at
sea
to
be
opened
when
i
see
fit
oh
yes
said
kirby
i
asked
you
is
ranjoor
singh
still
under
suspicion
my
good
sir
i
am
not
the
arbiter
of
ranjoor
singh
destiny
how
should
i
know
i
intend
to
know
vowed
kirby
rising
i
prepared
to
state
that
ranjoor
singh
is
not
in
danger
of
arrest
i
do
see
that
you
have
right
to
ask
more
than
that
colonel
kirby
martial
law
has
been
declared
this
morning
and
things
do
take
their
ordinary
course
any
longer
you
know
kirby
paced
once
across
the
office
floor
and
once
back
again
then
he
faced
the
man
in
drab
as
a
duelist
faces
his
antagonist
i
do
like
to
go
over
men
heads
he
said
as
you
threatened
to
do
to
me
for
instance
yesterday
if
you
will
give
me
satisfactory
assurance
that
ranjoor
singh
is
being
treated
as
a
loyal
officer
should
be
i
will
ask
no
more
if
not
i
shall
go
now
to
the
general
commanding
as
you
say
there
martial
law
now
he
the
man
to
see
colonel
kirby
said
the
man
in
drab
twisting
at
his
furiously
if
you
tell
me
what
in
your
sealed
orders
open
them
and
see
i
tell
you
what
i
know
about
ranjoor
singh
and
we
call
it
a
bargain
i
was
joking
said
kirby
turning
red
as
his
scalp
from
the
roots
of
his
hair
to
his
collar
i
in
deadly
earnest
said
the
man
in
drab
so
without
a
word
more
colonel
kirby
hurried
out
again
carrying
his
saber
in
his
left
hand
at
an
angle
that
was
peculiar
to
him
and
that
illustrated
determination
better
than
words
could
have
done
his
huge
horse
plunged
away
almost
before
he
had
gained
the
seat
and
saber
and
all
he
gained
the
seat
at
a
but
the
sais
was
not
up
behind
and
kirby
had
scarcely
settled
down
to
drive
before
the
man
in
drab
had
the
telephone
mouthpiece
to
his
lips
and
had
given
his
mysterious
number
again
he
coming
sir
he
said
curtly
somebody
at
the
other
end
apparently
asked
who
is
coming
for
the
man
in
drab
answered
kirby
five
minutes
later
kirby
caught
a
general
at
breakfast
and
was
received
with
courtesy
and
feigned
surprise
happen
to
know
anything
about
my
ranjoor
singh
asked
kirby
after
a
hasty
apology
for
bursting
in
why
he
was
under
suspicion
yesterday
i
was
told
so
next
he
disappeared
then
i
received
a
message
from
him
asking
me
to
assign
him
to
special
duty
that
was
after
i
more
than
half
believed
him
burned
to
death
in
a
place
called
the
he
has
sent
some
most
extraordinary
messages
to
his
squadron
by
the
hand
of
a
mysterious
babu
but
not
a
word
of
explanation
of
any
kind
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
him
sir
was
a
trooper
of
yours
murdered
yesterday
the
general
asked
yes
said
kirby
and
another
missing
yes
sir
did
ranjoor
singh
go
off
to
search
for
the
missing
man
i
was
told
so
well
i
glad
you
came
you
saved
me
trouble
did
you
put
ranjoor
singh
in
orders
as
assigned
to
special
duty
yes
what
is
the
missing
trooper
name
jagut
singh
well
please
enter
him
in
orders
too
special
service
special
service
said
the
general
how
about
ranjoor
charger
i
understand
that
he
been
kept
well
groomed
by
ranjoor
orders
and
my
adjutant
tells
me
he
has
the
horse
in
care
in
his
own
stable
the
general
made
a
note
whose
stable
lie
asked
warrington
warrington
of
outram
own
eh
captain
warrington
the
general
wrote
that
down
while
kirby
watched
him
bewildered
well
now
kirby
that
be
all
right
have
the
horse
left
there
will
you
i
hope
you
been
able
to
dispose
of
your
own
horses
to
advantage
two
chargers
do
seem
a
large
allowance
for
a
commanding
officer
of
a
cavalry
regiment
but
that
all
you
can
take
with
you
you
have
to
leave
the
rest
behind
have
given
it
a
thought
sir
too
busy
thinking
about
ranjoor
singh
worried
about
him
should
worry
said
the
general
ranjoor
singh
all
right
that
the
first
assurance
i
had
of
it
except
by
way
of
a
mysterious
note
said
kirby
by
all
right
i
mean
that
he
is
in
disgrace
but
now
about
your
horses
and
private
effects
you
done
nothing
about
them
i
have
time
to
attend
to
that
this
afternoon
sir
oh
no
you
wo
that
why
i
glad
you
came
these
he
gave
him
a
sealed
envelope
are
supplementary
orders
to
be
opened
when
you
get
back
to
barracks
i
want
you
out
of
the
way
by
noon
if
possible
send
a
man
down
this
morning
to
take
charge
of
whatever
any
of
you
want
kept
and
you
better
tell
him
to
sell
the
rest
and
pay
the
money
to
your
bankers
he
be
a
responsible
officer
that
all
kirby
and
good
luck
the
general
held
out
his
hand
one
more
minute
sir
said
kirby
about
ranjoor
singh
what
about
him
well
sir
what
about
him
what
have
you
heard
that
i
heard
a
sort
of
promise
that
he
be
with
his
squadron
to
lead
it
before
the
blood
runs
wo
that
be
time
enough
asked
the
general
smiling
he
was
looking
at
kirby
very
closely
not
sick
are
you
he
asked
no
i
thought
your
scalp
looked
rather
redder
than
usual
kirby
flushed
to
the
top
of
his
collar
instantly
and
the
general
pretended
to
arrange
a
sheaf
of
papers
on
the
table
one
reason
why
you
being
sent
first
my
boy
said
the
general
holding
out
his
hand
again
is
that
you
and
your
regiment
are
fittest
to
be
sent
but
i
taken
into
consideration
too
that
i
do
want
you
or
your
adjutant
killed
by
a
cobra
in
any
event
and
the
salt
sea
air
gets
rid
of
the
smell
of
musk
quicker
than
anything
kirby
my
boy
and
god
bless
you
sir
kirby
stammered
the
words
and
almost
ran
down
the
steps
to
his
waiting
as
all
good
men
do
when
undeserved
ridicule
or
blame
falls
to
their
lot
he
wondered
what
in
the
world
he
could
have
done
wrong
he
had
no
blame
for
anybody
only
a
fierce
resentment
of
injustice
an
almost
savage
sense
of
shame
that
any
one
should
know
about
the
adventure
of
the
night
before
and
a
rising
sense
of
joy
in
his
soldier
heart
because
he
had
orders
in
his
pocket
to
be
up
and
doing
so
and
only
so
could
he
forget
it
all
he
whipped
up
his
horse
and
went
down
the
general
drive
at
a
pace
that
made
the
british
sentry
at
the
gate
grin
from
ear
to
ear
with
approval
he
did
not
see
a
fat
babu
approach
the
bungalow
from
the
direction
of
the
bazaar
the
babu
salaamed
profoundly
but
kirby
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
road
ahead
and
his
thoughts
were
already
deep
in
the
future
he
saw
nothing
except
the
road
until
he
took
the
last
corner
into
barracks
on
one
wheel
and
drew
up
a
minute
later
in
front
of
the
bachelor
quarters
that
had
sheltered
him
for
the
past
four
years
pack
campaign
kit
one
trunk
he
ordered
his
servant
orderly
an
orderly
ran
in
from
outside
tell
major
brammle
and
captain
warrington
to
come
to
me
it
took
ten
minutes
to
find
warrington
since
every
job
was
his
and
nearly
every
responsibility
until
his
colonel
should
take
charge
of
a
paraded
perfect
regiment
and
lead
it
away
to
its
fate
he
came
at
last
however
and
on
the
run
and
brammle
with
him
orders
changed
said
kirby
march
at
noon
man
be
here
this
morning
to
take
charge
of
officers
effects
better
have
things
ready
for
him
and
full
instructions
one
trunk
allowed
each
officer
two
chargers
destination
sir
asked
brammle
not
disclosed
where
do
we
entrain
asked
warrington
we
march
out
of
delhi
entrain
later
at
a
place
appointed
on
the
road
warrington
began
to
hum
to
himself
and
to
be
utterly
consciously
happy
then
i
get
a
move
on
he
said
starting
to
hurry
out
everything
ready
but
wait
a
minute
commanded
kirby
and
warrington
remained
in
the
room
after
brammle
had
left
it
you
have
said
anything
to
anybody
of
course
about
that
incident
last
night
no
sir
then
has
warrington
whistled
are
you
sure
she
has
quite
i
just
had
proof
of
it
makes
a
fellow
reverence
the
sex
swore
warrington
it
be
forgotten
by
the
time
we
back
in
india
said
kirby
solemnly
remember
to
keep
absolutely
silent
about
it
the
best
way
to
help
others
forget
it
is
to
forget
it
yourself
not
one
word
now
to
anybody
even
under
provocation
not
a
word
sir
all
right
go
and
attend
to
business
what
attending
to
business
meant
nobody
can
guess
who
has
not
been
in
at
the
breaking
up
of
quarters
at
short
notice
everything
was
ready
as
warrington
had
boasted
but
even
an
automobile
may
stall
for
a
time
in
the
hands
of
the
best
chauffeur
and
a
regiment
contains
as
many
separate
human
equations
as
it
has
men
in
its
ranks
the
amount
of
personal
possessions
that
had
to
be
jettisoned
or
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
a
perfunctory
agent
would
have
wrung
groans
from
any
one
but
soldiers
the
last
minute
details
that
seemed
to
be
nobody
job
and
that
therefore
all
fell
to
warrington
because
somebody
had
to
see
to
them
were
beyond
the
imagination
of
any
but
an
adjutant
and
not
even
warrington
imagination
proved
quite
equal
to
the
task
we
ready
sir
he
reported
at
last
to
kirby
we
paraded
and
waiting
brammle
inspected
and
i
done
ditto
there
are
only
thirteen
thousand
details
left
undone
that
i
ca
think
of
and
not
one
of
important
enough
to
keep
us
waitin
so
kirby
rode
out
on
parade
and
took
the
regiment
salute
there
was
nobody
to
see
them
off
there
were
not
even
women
to
wail
by
the
barrack
gate
for
they
marched
away
at
and
official
lies
had
been
distributed
where
they
would
do
most
good
englishman
and
sikh
alike
rode
untormented
by
the
wails
or
waving
farewells
of
their
kindred
and
there
was
only
a
civilian
on
a
white
pony
somewhere
along
ahead
who
seemed
to
know
that
they
were
more
than
just
parading
he
led
them
toward
the
ajmere
gate
and
by
the
time
that
the
regiment
luggage
came
along
in
wagons
with
the
little
last
of
all
it
was
too
late
to
run
and
warn
people
outram
own
had
gone
at
high
noon
and
nobody
the
wiser
there
was
no
music
as
they
marched
and
no
talking
only
the
jingling
bits
and
rattling
hoofs
proclaimed
that
india
best
were
riding
on
a
sudden
summons
to
fight
for
the
salt
they
marched
in
the
direction
least
expected
of
them
of
a
day
before
their
scheduled
time
and
even
guppy
the
mess
who
ran
under
the
wagon
with
the
officers
luggage
behaved
as
if
all
ends
of
the
world
were
one
to
him
he
waved
his
tail
with
dignity
and
trotted
in
content
hard
by
the
ajmere
gate
they
halted
for
some
bullock
carts
had
claimed
their
prerogative
of
getting
in
the
way
while
the
bullocks
to
much
and
objurgation
labored
in
the
mud
in
every
direction
but
the
right
one
colonel
kirby
sat
his
charger
almost
underneath
the
gate
waiting
patiently
then
the
clattered
off
and
he
led
along
he
never
knew
where
it
came
from
and
he
never
tried
to
guess
he
caught
it
instinctively
and
kept
it
for
the
sake
of
chivalry
or
perhaps
because
she
had
made
him
think
for
a
moment
of
his
mother
at
all
events
the
bunch
of
jasmine
flowers
that
fell
into
his
lap
found
a
warm
berth
under
his
buttoned
tunic
and
he
rode
on
through
the
great
gate
with
a
kinder
thought
for
yasmini
than
probably
she
would
guess
with
that
resentment
gone
he
could
ride
now
as
suited
him
with
all
his
thoughts
ahead
and
there
lacked
then
only
one
thing
to
complete
his
pleasure
he
missed
ranjoor
singh
it
was
not
that
the
squadron
would
lack
good
leading
an
english
officer
had
taken
ranjoor
singh
place
it
was
the
man
he
missed
the
decent
loyal
gentleman
who
had
worked
untiringly
to
sweat
a
squadron
into
shape
to
kirby
liking
and
never
once
presumed
nor
had
taken
offense
at
criticism
the
man
who
had
been
good
enough
to
understand
the
ethics
of
an
alien
colonel
and
to
translate
them
for
the
benefit
of
his
command
it
is
not
easy
for
a
sikh
to
rise
to
the
rank
of
major
and
lead
a
squadron
for
the
raj
he
counted
ranjoor
singh
his
friend
and
he
knew
that
ranjoor
singh
would
have
given
all
the
rest
of
his
life
to
ride
away
now
for
only
one
encounter
on
a
foreign
nothing
nothing
less
than
the
word
of
ranjoor
singh
himself
would
ever
convince
him
of
the
disloyalty
and
he
would
have
felt
better
if
he
could
have
shaken
hands
with
ranjoor
singh
before
going
since
it
seemed
to
be
the
order
of
the
day
that
the
sikh
should
stay
behind
it
did
not
seem
quite
the
thing
to
be
riding
away
to
war
with
the
best
native
officer
in
all
india
somewhere
in
delhi
on
special
service
whatever
that
might
be
he
was
given
as
a
rule
to
smiling
at
any
man
who
did
his
best
on
any
other
day
he
would
have
very
likely
exchanged
a
joke
with
the
who
labored
so
unavailingly
to
get
the
road
cleared
in
a
hurry
but
since
his
thoughts
were
of
ranjoor
singh
he
paid
the
man
no
attention
he
had
not
even
formed
a
mental
picture
of
him
by
the
time
he
passed
the
gate
it
was
warrington
cantering
up
from
behind
a
minute
or
so
later
who
changed
the
color
of
the
earth
and
sky
did
you
recognize
him
sir
whom
ranjoor
singh
no
where
not
the
who
blocked
the
road
but
the
man
who
ran
out
from
behind
the
gate
and
straightened
things
out
again
that
man
was
ranjoor
singh
in
mufti
what
makes
you
think
so
i
recognized
him
so
did
his
squadron
look
at
them
they
riding
like
new
men
kirby
looked
and
there
was
no
doubt
about
d
squadron
is
he
there
still
he
asked
i
can
see
a
man
standing
there
see
him
fellow
in
white
between
two
bullock
carts
kirby
pulled
out
to
the
roadside
and
let
the
regiment
pass
him
then
he
cantered
back
the
man
between
the
bullock
carts
had
his
back
turned
and
was
gazing
toward
delhi
under
his
hand
ranjoor
singh
said
kirby
reining
suddenly
is
that
you
uh
the
man
faced
about
he
was
no
more
ranjoor
singh
than
he
was
colonel
kirby
where
is
the
man
who
came
from
behind
the
gate
to
clear
the
road
the
man
pointed
toward
the
gate
inside
within
the
gloom
of
the
gate
itself
kirby
was
certain
he
saw
a
sikh
who
stood
at
the
salute
he
cantered
to
the
gate
for
he
would
have
given
a
year
pay
for
word
with
ranjoor
singh
but
when
he
reached
the
gate
the
man
was
gone
and
he
promised
he
be
there
to
lead
his
squadron
when
the
blood
runs
wondered
kirby
now
a
trap
said
the
tiger
is
easy
to
spot
oh
jungli
be
seated
and
listen
some
tempt
you
with
live
bait
and
others
do
not
oh
jungli
be
leery
and
listen
the
easiest
sort
to
detect
have
a
door
a
box
with
three
walls
and
a
roof
and
a
floor
that
the
veriest
hungriest
cub
should
ignore
oh
jungli
stop
laughing
and
listen
this
is
a
trap
as
i
show
you
my
friend
but
the
tiger
fell
into
it
that
is
the
end
oh
jungli
be
loving
and
listen
yasmini
song
chapter
x
ranjoor
singh
on
the
trail
of
a
murderer
shoved
with
his
whole
strength
against
a
little
door
of
the
it
yielded
suddenly
he
shot
in
headlong
and
the
door
slammed
behind
him
as
he
fell
forward
into
pitch
blackness
he
was
conscious
of
shooting
bolts
behind
and
of
the
squeaking
of
a
beam
swung
into
place
but
having
served
the
raj
for
more
years
than
he
wanted
to
remember
through
three
campaigns
in
the
himalayas
once
against
the
masudis
and
once
in
china
he
was
in
full
possession
of
trained
soldier
senses
darkness
he
calculated
instantly
was
a
shield
to
him
who
can
use
it
and
a
danger
only
to
the
unwary
and
there
are
grades
of
wariness
just
as
there
are
grades
of
sloth
two
men
who
thought
themselves
so
wide
awake
as
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
government
each
threw
a
noosed
rope
and
caught
each
other
ranjoor
singh
could
not
see
the
ropes
but
he
could
hear
the
stifled
swearing
and
the
ensuing
struggle
and
an
ear
is
as
good
as
an
eye
in
the
dark
something
he
never
knew
what
warned
him
to
duck
and
step
forward
he
felt
the
whistle
of
a
club
that
missed
him
by
so
little
as
to
make
the
skin
twitch
on
the
back
of
his
neck
his
right
leg
shot
sidewise
and
he
tripped
a
man
in
another
second
he
had
the
club
and
there
was
no
measurable
interval
of
time
then
before
the
darkness
was
a
living
miracle
of
blows
that
came
from
everywhere
and
missed
nothing
three
men
went
down
and
ranjoor
singh
was
in
command
of
a
situation
whose
wherefore
and
possibilities
he
could
not
guess
until
an
electric
torch
declared
itself
some
twenty
feet
away
at
more
than
twice
his
height
and
he
stood
vignetted
in
a
circle
of
white
light
the
sahib
proves
a
gentle
guest
purred
a
voice
he
thought
he
recognized
it
was
a
woman
has
the
sahib
a
pistol
with
him
ranjoor
singh
cursing
his
own
neglect
of
soldierly
precaution
saw
fit
not
to
answer
a
human
arm
reached
like
a
snake
into
the
ring
of
light
he
struck
at
it
with
the
club
and
a
groan
announced
that
he
had
struck
hard
enough
does
the
sahib
think
that
the
noise
of
a
pistol
would
cause
his
friends
to
come
is
ranjoor
singh
ashamed
speak
sahib
is
it
well
to
break
into
a
house
and
be
surly
with
the
hostess
ranjoor
singh
stepped
backward
and
the
ring
of
light
followed
him
until
he
stood
pressed
against
the
teak
door
and
could
feel
the
heavy
beam
that
ran
up
and
down
it
locked
firmly
above
and
below
he
prodded
over
his
head
behind
him
with
the
club
trying
to
find
what
held
the
beam
and
the
ring
of
light
lifted
a
foot
or
two
then
five
feet
until
its
center
was
on
the
center
of
the
club
handle
a
pistol
cracked
and
flashed
then
from
behind
the
light
and
the
club
splintered
he
dropped
it
and
the
ceased
leaving
him
dazed
but
not
so
dazed
that
he
did
not
hear
a
man
sneak
up
and
carry
the
splintered
club
away
he
followed
after
the
man
for
he
knew
now
that
he
was
in
a
narrow
passage
and
no
man
could
get
by
him
to
attack
from
behind
but
again
the
sought
him
out
to
the
foot
of
steep
stairs
that
he
could
dimly
outline
he
halted
for
advance
against
hidden
and
dazzling
light
was
futile
look
said
the
same
soft
woman
voice
look
sahib
see
ranjoor
singh
the
hooded
death
see
the
hooded
death
behind
you
it
was
not
her
command
that
made
him
look
he
knew
better
than
to
turn
his
head
at
an
unseen
woman
bidding
in
the
dark
but
he
heard
them
hiss
and
he
turned
to
see
four
cobras
come
toward
him
with
the
front
third
of
their
bodies
raised
from
the
floor
and
their
hoods
extended
he
saw
that
a
panel
in
the
wooden
wall
had
slid
and
the
last
tail
was
yet
inside
the
gap
there
was
no
need
of
a
man
to
slip
between
him
and
the
door
there
are
more
in
the
wall
ranjoor
singh
will
they
follow
thee
see
they
come
step
swiftly
for
the
hooded
death
is
swift
the
light
went
out
again
and
his
ears
were
all
he
had
to
warn
him
of
the
snakes
approach
ears
and
imagination
swift
as
a
well
launched
charge
of
light
cavalry
he
leaped
for
the
stairs
and
took
them
four
at
a
time
he
reached
the
top
one
sooner
than
he
knew
it
the
torch
flashed
in
his
eyes
and
he
saw
a
just
beyond
stand
ranjoor
singh
said
a
voice
that
he
felt
sure
he
recognized
his
eyes
began
to
search
beyond
the
light
for
glimpses
of
dim
outline
back
ranjoor
singh
back
to
the
right
toward
that
door
in
through
that
door
so
he
obeyed
since
he
knew
now
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
there
was
no
sense
at
all
in
taking
liberties
with
yasmini
he
stepped
into
a
bare
dark
room
and
she
followed
him
and
she
had
scarcely
closed
the
door
at
her
back
before
another
door
opened
at
the
farther
end
and
two
of
her
maids
appeared
carrying
what
do
you
want
with
me
demanded
ranjoor
singh
nay
did
i
invite
the
sahib
i
came
about
a
murderer
who
entered
by
that
door
through
which
i
came
to
pay
him
the
reward
perhaps
she
asked
impudently
is
this
thy
house
asked
ranjoor
singh
this
is
the
sahib
this
is
a
hole
where
murderers
hide
a
man
of
mine
was
slain
in
the
street
below
and
the
murderer
came
in
here
where
is
he
now
he
and
the
bigger
fool
who
followed
him
said
yasmini
poising
herself
like
a
nodding
blossom
and
smiling
like
the
promise
of
new
love
as
she
paused
to
be
insolent
and
let
the
insolence
sink
home
are
at
my
mercy
ranjoor
singh
did
not
answer
but
she
could
draw
no
amusement
from
his
silence
for
his
eye
was
unafraid
i
am
from
the
north
where
the
quality
of
mercy
is
thought
weakness
she
smiled
sweetly
who
asks
mercy
i
was
seen
and
heard
to
enter
there
will
be
a
hundred
seeking
me
within
an
hour
sahib
within
two
hours
there
will
be
five
thousand
around
this
house
yet
none
will
seek
to
enter
and
they
will
find
no
murderer
though
thou
shalt
see
thy
murderer
come
this
way
sahib
a
whiff
of
warm
wind
might
have
blown
her
so
swiftly
lissomely
she
ran
toward
the
other
door
laughing
back
at
him
across
her
shoulder
and
leaving
a
trail
of
aromatic
scent
the
two
maids
held
their
high
and
striding
like
a
soldier
ranjoor
singh
followed
yasmini
not
caring
that
the
maids
shut
the
heavy
door
behind
him
and
bolted
it
he
argued
to
himself
that
he
was
as
safe
in
one
room
as
in
another
and
she
as
dangerous
also
that
it
made
no
difference
in
which
room
he
might
be
when
the
squadron
or
his
colonel
missed
him
look
ranjoor
singh
look
through
that
hole
there
was
plenty
of
light
in
this
room
for
there
was
a
lantern
in
every
corner
he
could
see
that
she
was
gazing
through
a
hole
in
the
wall
at
something
that
amused
her
and
she
motioned
to
another
hole
eight
feet
away
from
it
he
crossed
a
floor
that
was
solid
and
no
two
planks
of
it
were
of
even
width
or
length
but
none
creaked
at
her
invitation
he
looked
through
the
little
square
hole
she
pointed
out
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
confessed
surprise
thou
jagut
singh
he
exclaimed
he
stepped
back
blinked
to
reassure
himself
and
stepped
to
the
hole
again
back
to
back
tied
right
hand
to
right
left
hand
to
left
so
that
their
arms
were
crossed
behind
them
and
lashed
waist
to
waist
a
trooper
of
d
squadron
and
the
afridi
whom
lie
had
kicked
at
sat
on
the
floor
facing
opposite
walls
dumb
misery
was
stamped
on
the
sikh
face
the
despair
of
evaporated
savagery
on
the
afridi
jagut
singh
said
the
louder
this
time
and
the
trooper
looked
up
almost
as
if
hope
had
been
that
instant
born
in
him
jagut
singh
the
trooper
grinned
a
white
row
of
ivory
showed
between
his
black
beard
and
mustache
he
tried
to
look
sidewise
but
the
rope
that
held
him
tight
to
the
afridi
hurt
his
neck
i
knew
it
sahib
he
shouted
i
knew
that
one
would
come
for
me
this
hill
wildcat
has
fought
until
the
ropes
cut
both
of
us
but
take
time
sahib
i
can
wait
attend
to
the
duty
first
only
let
him
who
comes
bring
water
with
him
for
this
is
a
thirsty
place
ranjoor
singh
looked
sidewise
he
could
see
that
yasmini
was
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
her
prisoners
her
little
lithe
form
was
pressed
tightly
against
the
wall
less
than
two
yards
away
he
could
guess
and
he
had
heard
a
dozen
times
that
dancing
had
made
her
stronger
than
a
panther
and
more
swift
yet
he
thought
that
if
he
had
her
in
his
arms
he
could
crush
those
light
ribs
until
she
would
yield
and
order
her
prisoner
released
the
trooper
confidence
deserved
immediate
not
postponed
reward
he
watched
for
a
minute
he
could
see
that
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
regularly
against
the
woodwork
she
was
all
unconscious
of
her
danger
he
was
sure
of
it
he
changed
his
position
and
she
neither
looked
nor
moved
he
changed
it
again
so
that
his
weight
was
all
on
his
left
foot
he
was
sure
she
had
not
noticed
then
he
sprang
he
sprang
sidewise
as
a
horse
does
that
sees
a
snake
by
the
roadside
every
nerve
and
sinew
keyed
to
the
tightest
pitch
eye
ear
and
instinct
working
together
and
she
in
the
same
second
turned
to
meet
him
smiling
with
outstretched
arms
as
if
she
would
meet
him
and
hug
him
to
her
bosom
only
she
stepped
a
pace
backward
instead
of
forward
as
she
had
seemed
to
intend
he
landed
where
he
had
meant
to
on
the
spot
where
she
had
stood
his
left
hand
clutched
at
the
wall
and
a
second
too
late
he
made
a
wild
grab
at
the
hole
she
had
peered
through
trying
to
get
his
fingers
into
it
what
she
had
done
he
never
knew
but
the
floor
she
had
stood
on
yielded
and
he
heard
her
laugh
as
he
slipped
through
the
opening
like
a
tiger
into
a
and
fell
downward
into
blackness
with
a
last
tremendous
effort
he
caught
at
the
floor
and
held
himself
suspended
by
his
but
she
came
and
trod
on
them
and
though
her
weight
was
light
malice
made
her
skilful
and
she
hurt
him
until
he
had
to
set
his
teeth
and
drop
he
would
never
have
believed
that
those
soft
could
have
given
so
much
pain
forget
not
thy
trooper
in
his
need
she
called
as
he
fell
away
through
the
opening
and
then
the
trap
shut
to
his
surprise
he
did
not
fall
very
far
and
though
he
landed
on
an
elbow
and
a
hip
he
struck
so
softly
that
for
a
moment
he
believed
he
must
be
mad
or
dead
or
dreaming
then
his
fingers
numb
from
yasmini
pressure
began
to
recognize
the
feel
of
and
of
and
of
paper
also
he
smelled
kerosene
or
something
very
like
it
forget
not
the
water
for
thy
trooper
ranjoor
singh
he
looked
up
to
see
yasmini
face
framed
in
the
opening
and
he
thought
there
was
more
devilment
expressed
in
it
for
all
her
loveliness
than
in
her
voice
that
never
quite
lost
its
hint
of
laughter
he
did
not
answer
and
the
closed
again
he
knelt
and
began
to
grope
through
the
dark
on
hands
and
knees
but
gave
that
up
presently
because
the
dust
from
old
sacks
and
piles
of
rubbish
began
to
choke
him
then
rats
came
to
investigate
him
he
heard
several
of
them
scamper
close
and
one
bit
his
leg
so
he
made
ready
to
fight
for
his
life
against
the
worst
enemy
a
man
may
have
praying
a
little
in
the
sikh
way
that
does
not
reckon
god
to
be
far
off
at
any
time
suddenly
the
opened
and
the
rats
scampered
away
from
the
light
and
noise
thus
is
a
soldier
answered
muttered
ranjoor
singh
is
the
sahib
thirsty
wondered
yasmini
he
could
hear
her
pouring
water
out
of
a
brass
ewer
into
a
dish
and
pouring
it
back
again
the
metal
rang
and
the
water
splashed
deliriously
but
he
was
not
very
thirsty
yet
he
had
been
thirstier
on
parade
a
hundred
times
when
her
head
and
shoulders
darkened
the
aperture
he
did
not
trouble
this
time
to
look
at
her
is
it
dark
down
there
she
asked
him
but
he
did
not
answer
so
she
struck
a
match
and
lit
a
newspaper
in
a
moment
a
ball
of
fire
was
floating
downward
to
him
and
it
was
then
that
the
smell
of
dust
and
kerosene
entered
his
consciousness
as
pincers
enter
the
flesh
of
men
in
torment
he
stood
up
with
hands
upstretched
to
catch
the
fire
caught
it
bore
it
downward
and
smothered
it
in
still
dark
she
said
looking
through
the
aperture
once
more
i
will
send
another
one
so
ranjoor
singh
found
his
tongue
and
cursed
her
with
a
force
and
comprehensiveness
that
only
asia
can
command
he
gave
her
to
understand
that
the
next
fire
she
dropped
on
him
should
be
allowed
to
work
will
and
burn
her
her
her
rats
her
cobras
and
her
cutthroats
two
honest
sikhs
he
swore
would
die
well
to
such
an
end
drop
thy
fire
and
i
will
fan
the
flame
he
vowed
and
she
believed
him
i
will
send
my
cobras
down
to
keep
the
sahib
company
she
mocked
but
ranjoor
singh
proposed
to
take
one
danger
at
a
time
and
he
was
quite
sure
that
she
wanted
him
alive
not
dead
for
otherwise
he
would
have
been
dead
already
he
held
his
tongue
and
listened
while
she
splashed
the
water
thy
trooper
is
very
thirsty
sahib
she
was
on
a
warmer
scent
now
for
that
squadron
of
his
and
the
men
of
his
squadron
were
the
one
love
of
his
warrior
life
some
spirit
of
malice
whispered
her
as
much
the
trooper
shall
have
water
when
ranjoor
singh
sahib
has
promised
on
his
sikh
honor
promised
what
his
voice
betrayed
interest
at
last
it
suggested
future
possibilities
instead
of
a
grim
present
that
he
will
do
what
is
required
of
him
is
that
the
price
of
a
drink
for
jagut
singh
aye
will
the
sahib
pay
or
will
he
let
the
trooper
parch
ask
jagut
singh
go
ask
him
let
it
be
as
he
answers
he
could
hear
her
hurry
away
although
she
slammed
the
shut
evidently
she
was
not
satisfied
to
speak
through
the
little
hole
and
he
suspected
that
she
was
showing
the
man
water
perhaps
giving
some
to
the
afridi
for
sweet
suggestion
sake
she
was
back
within
five
minutes
and
by
the
way
she
opened
the
trap
and
grinned
at
him
he
knew
what
her
answer
would
be
he
begs
that
you
promise
he
begs
sahib
he
says
he
is
thy
trooper
thy
dog
thy
menial
and
very
thirsty
bring
some
one
who
knows
better
how
to
lie
said
ranjoor
singh
i
what
his
answer
was
he
said
to
the
sahib
that
i
have
eaten
salt
but
i
am
not
thirsty
go
tell
him
his
answer
was
a
good
one
and
that
i
know
he
said
it
i
know
that
man
as
men
know
each
other
thou
art
a
woman
and
thy
knowledge
is
but
emptiness
thou
hast
heard
now
twice
what
the
answer
is
once
from
him
and
once
from
me
i
will
leave
thee
to
the
rats
she
said
slamming
the
tight
the
rats
came
and
he
began
to
grope
about
for
a
weapon
to
use
against
them
he
caught
one
rat
in
his
fingers
squeezed
the
squealing
brute
to
death
and
flung
it
away
and
he
heard
a
hundred
of
its
messmates
race
to
devour
the
carcass
he
began
to
see
little
active
eyes
around
him
in
the
blackness
that
watched
his
every
movement
and
he
kept
moving
since
that
seemed
to
puzzle
them
also
he
wondered
as
a
drowning
man
might
wonder
about
things
how
long
it
would
be
before
colonel
kirby
would
send
for
him
to
ask
about
the
murdered
trooper
something
would
happen
then
he
felt
quite
sure
the
rats
by
this
time
had
grown
very
daring
and
he
had
been
bitten
again
twice
he
found
time
to
wonder
what
lies
yasmini
would
tell
to
account
for
her
share
in
things
he
did
not
doubt
she
would
lie
herself
out
of
it
but
he
wondered
just
how
along
what
unexpected
line
it
began
to
seem
to
him
that
the
colonel
and
his
squadron
were
a
very
long
time
coming
but
they
will
come
he
assured
himself
he
was
nearer
to
the
mark
when
he
expected
unexpectedness
from
yasmini
for
she
did
not
disappoint
him
a
door
opened
at
one
end
of
the
black
dark
cellar
and
again
the
rats
scampered
for
cover
as
yasmini
herself
stood
framed
in
it
with
a
lantern
above
her
head
she
was
alone
and
he
could
not
see
that
she
had
any
weapon
this
way
sahib
she
called
sweetly
to
him
never
north
south
east
or
west
in
olden
days
or
modern
did
a
siren
call
half
so
seductively
every
move
she
ever
made
was
poetry
expressed
but
framed
in
a
golden
aura
shed
by
the
lamp
and
swaying
in
the
velvet
blackness
of
the
pit
mouth
she
was
it
seemed
to
ranjoor
singh
as
no
man
had
ever
yet
seen
woman
come
sahib
she
called
again
and
he
moved
toward
her
food
and
water
wait
thy
trooper
has
drunk
his
fill
come
sahib
she
made
no
move
at
all
to
protect
herself
from
him
she
did
not
lead
into
the
cavern
beyond
the
door
she
waited
for
him
leaning
against
the
and
smiling
as
if
she
and
he
were
old
friends
who
understood
each
other
i
but
tried
thee
ranjoor
singh
she
smiled
looking
up
into
his
face
and
holding
the
lantern
closer
to
his
eyes
as
if
she
would
read
behind
them
thou
art
a
soldier
and
not
a
buffalo
at
all
i
am
sorry
that
i
called
thee
buffalo
my
heart
goes
out
ever
to
a
brave
man
ranjoor
singh
he
was
actually
at
her
side
her
clothes
touched
his
and
he
could
have
flung
his
arms
around
her
but
it
was
the
move
next
after
that
which
seemed
obscure
he
wondered
what
her
reply
would
be
and
moving
the
lantern
a
little
she
read
the
hesitation
in
his
eyes
the
wavering
between
desire
for
vengeance
a
soldierly
regard
for
sex
and
mistrust
of
her
apparent
helplessness
and
being
yasmini
she
dared
him
like
swords
i
have
seen
she
laughed
two
cutting
edges
and
a
point
not
to
be
held
save
by
the
hilt
eh
ranjoor
singh
search
me
for
weapons
first
and
then
use
that
dagger
in
thy
hair
i
am
unarmed
lead
on
he
commanded
in
a
voice
that
grated
harshly
for
it
needed
all
his
willpower
to
prevent
his
from
giving
out
he
knew
that
behind
temptation
of
any
kind
there
lie
the
iron
teeth
of
unexpected
consequences
she
let
the
lantern
swing
below
her
knees
and
leaned
back
to
laugh
at
him
until
the
cavern
behind
her
echoed
as
if
all
the
underworld
had
seen
and
was
amused
i
called
thee
a
buffalo
she
panted
nay
i
was
very
wrong
i
laugh
at
my
mistake
come
ranjoor
singh
with
a
swing
of
the
lantern
and
a
swerve
of
her
lithe
body
she
slipped
out
of
his
reach
and
danced
down
an
passage
out
of
which
doors
seemed
to
lead
at
every
six
or
seven
yards
only
the
doors
were
all
made
fast
with
iron
bolts
so
huge
that
it
would
take
two
men
to
manage
them
he
hurried
after
her
but
the
faster
he
followed
the
faster
she
ran
until
it
needed
little
imagination
to
conceive
her
a
and
himself
a
crazy
man
come
she
kept
calling
to
him
come
and
then
she
commenced
to
sing
as
if
dark
passages
beneath
the
delhi
streets
were
a
fit
setting
for
her
skill
and
loveliness
ranjoor
singh
had
never
heard
the
song
before
it
was
about
a
tiger
who
boasted
and
fell
into
a
trap
it
made
him
more
cautious
than
he
might
have
been
and
when
the
darkness
began
to
grow
less
opaque
he
slowed
into
a
walk
then
he
stood
still
for
he
could
not
see
her
any
longer
it
occurred
to
him
to
turn
back
but
that
thought
had
not
more
than
crossed
his
mind
when
a
noose
was
pulled
tight
around
his
legs
and
a
big
sheet
thrown
out
of
the
darkness
was
wrapped
and
wrapped
about
him
until
he
could
neither
shout
nor
move
he
knew
that
they
were
women
who
managed
the
sheet
because
he
bit
one
finger
through
it
and
she
screamed
then
he
heard
yasmini
voice
close
to
his
ear
thy
colonel
sahib
and
another
are
outside
she
whispered
it
is
not
well
to
wait
here
ranjoor
singh
next
he
felt
a
great
rush
of
air
and
after
that
the
roar
of
flame
was
so
unmistakable
although
he
could
feel
no
heat
yet
that
he
wondered
whether
he
was
to
be
burned
alive
is
it
well
alight
asked
yasmini
yes
said
a
maid
whose
teeth
chattered
good
presently
the
fools
will
come
and
pour
water
enough
to
fill
this
passage
thus
none
may
follow
us
come
ranjoor
singh
was
gathered
up
and
carried
by
frightened
women
he
could
feel
them
tremble
for
a
moment
he
felt
the
outer
air
and
he
caught
the
shout
of
a
crowd
that
had
seen
flames
then
he
was
thrown
face
downward
on
the
floor
of
some
sort
of
carriage
and
driven
away
he
lost
all
sense
of
direction
after
a
moment
though
he
did
not
forget
to
count
and
by
his
rough
reckoning
he
was
driven
through
the
streets
for
about
nine
minutes
at
a
fast
trot
then
the
carriage
stopped
and
he
was
carried
out
again
up
almost
endless
stairs
across
a
floor
that
seemed
yet
more
endless
and
thrown
into
a
corner
he
heard
a
door
slam
shut
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
his
fingers
that
had
never
once
ceased
working
tore
a
corner
of
the
sheet
loose
in
another
minute
he
was
free
he
threw
the
sheet
from
him
and
looked
about
accustoming
his
eyes
to
darkness
presently
not
far
from
him
he
made
out
the
sheeted
figure
of
another
man
who
lay
exactly
as
he
had
done
and
worked
with
tired
fingers
he
drew
the
dagger
out
of
his
hair
and
cut
the
man
loose
jagut
singh
he
exclaimed
the
trooper
stood
up
and
saluted
who
brought
thee
here
women
sahib
in
a
carriage
when
even
now
where
is
that
afridi
dead
sahib
how
she
brought
us
water
in
a
brass
vessel
saying
it
was
by
thy
orders
sahib
she
cut
us
loose
and
gave
him
water
first
then
while
she
gave
me
to
drink
the
afridi
attacked
her
and
i
slew
him
with
my
hands
tearing
his
throat
out
thus
while
the
life
yet
fluttered
in
him
they
threw
a
sheet
over
me
and
here
i
am
salaam
sahib
the
trooper
saluted
again
who
made
thee
prisoner
in
the
first
place
hillmen
sahib
at
the
orders
of
the
afridi
who
is
now
dead
they
made
ready
to
torture
me
showing
me
the
knives
they
would
use
but
she
came
and
they
obeyed
her
binding
the
afridi
fast
to
me
after
that
i
heard
the
sahib
voice
and
then
this
happened
that
is
all
sahib
well
said
ranjoor
singh
and
for
the
third
time
his

chapter
xi
men
say
yasmini
does
not
sleep
of
course
that
is
absurd
none
the
less
it
is
certain
she
must
do
much
of
her
plotting
in
the
daytime
for
by
night
until
after
midnight
she
is
always
the
yasmini
whom
the
northern
gentry
know
at
home
to
all
comers
in
her
wonderful
apartment
it
is
ever
a
mystery
to
them
how
she
knows
all
that
is
going
on
in
delhi
and
in
india
and
in
the
greater
outer
world
although
they
themselves
bring
her
information
that
no
government
could
ever
suck
out
of
the
silent
hills
they
know
where
she
keeps
her
cobras
where
the
is
in
which
her
jewels
lie
crowded
who
run
her
errands
and
some
of
her
past
history
for
not
even
a
mongoose
is
more
inquisitive
than
a
man
born
in
the
hills
and
yasmini
has
many
maids
but
none
not
even
her
favorite
most
confidential
maids
know
what
is
in
the
little
room
that
she
reaches
down
a
private
flight
of
stairs
that
have
a
steel
door
at
the
top
she
keeps
the
key
to
that
steel
door
and
it
has
besides
a
combination
lock
that
only
she
understands
once
a
very
clever
hillman
who
had
been
south
for
an
education
and
had
learned
skepticism
in
addition
to
the
rule
of
three
undertook
to
discover
wires
leading
over
to
that
room
but
he
searched
for
a
week
and
did
not
find
them
when
his
search
was
over
and
all
had
done
laughing
at
him
he
was
found
one
night
with
a
between
his
and
later
still
yasmini
sang
a
song
about
him
none
searched
for
wires
after
that
and
the
consensus
of
opinion
still
is
that
she
makes
magic
in
the
room
she
sought
that
room
the
minute
ranjoor
singh
was
safely
locked
in
with
his
trooper
although
her
maids
reported
more
than
one
northern
gentleman
waiting
impatiently
in
the
larger
of
her
two
for
official
information
of
the
war
government
bulletins
are
regarded
as
pure
fiction
always
unless
confirmed
by
yasmini
and
within
five
minutes
of
ranjoor
singh
release
of
his
trooper
from
the
sheet
no
less
a
personage
than
a
general
officer
had
thrown
aside
other
business
and
had
drawn
on
a
cloak
of
secrecy
that
not
even
his
own
secretary
could
penetrate
closed
carriage
he
ordered
and
as
though
the
fire
brigade
were
doing
double
duty
a
carriage
came
and
the
horses
halted
from
the
gallop
outside
his
door
pathan
turban
he
ordered
and
his
servant
brought
him
one
sheepskin
cloak
in
a
moment
the
upper
half
of
him
would
have
passed
in
the
dark
for
that
of
a
rather
portly
northern
trader
he
decided
that
a
rug
would
do
the
rest
and
snatched
one
as
he
ran
for
the
carriage
with
the
turban
under
his
arm
he
gave
no
order
to
the
driver
other
than
cheloh
and
that
means
go
ahead
so
the
driver
who
was
a
sikh
went
ahead
as
the
guns
go
into
action
asway
and
aswing
regardless
of
everything
but
speed
yasmini
said
the
general
at
the
end
of
a
hundred
yards
and
the
sikh
took
a
square
turn
at
full
gallop
with
a
neatness
the
horse
artillery
could
not
have
bettered
there
seemed
to
be
no
need
of
further
instructions
for
the
sikh
pulled
up
unbidden
at
the
private
door
that
is
to
all
appearance
only
a
mark
on
the
wall
with
a
rug
around
his
middle
there
shot
out
then
what
a
watching
small
boy
described
afterward
as
a
fat
on
his
way
to
be
fleeced
the
carriage
drove
on
for
coachmen
who
wait
outside
yasmini
door
are
likely
to
be
butts
for
questions
the
door
opened
without
any
audible
signal
and
the
man
with
the
rug
around
his
middle
disappeared
he
had
ceased
to
bear
any
resemblance
to
any
one
but
a
stout
english
general
in
by
the
time
he
reached
the
dark
stairhead
and
yasmini
took
the
precaution
of
being
there
alone
to
meet
him
she
held
a
whom
have
you
he
demanded
they
seemed
to
understand
each
other
these
two
he
paid
her
no
compliments
and
she
expected
none
she
made
no
attempt
at
all
to
flatter
him
or
deceive
him
but
being
yasmini
it
did
not
lie
in
her
to
answer
straightly
i
set
a
trap
and
a
buffalo
blundered
into
it
he
will
do
better
than
any
other
whom
have
you
ranjoor
singh
the
general
whistled
softly
of
the
sikh
light
cavalry
he
asked
one
of
kirby
sahib
officers
and
a
trooper
into
the
bargain
the
general
whistled
again
there
were
two
troopers
whom
i
meant
to
catch
she
said
hurriedly
for
it
was
evident
that
the
general
did
not
at
all
approve
of
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
i
had
a
trap
for
them
at
the
and
some
hillmen
in
there
ready
to
rush
out
and
seize
them
as
they
passed
but
a
fool
afridi
murdered
one
and
i
only
got
there
in
the
nick
of
time
to
save
the
other
life
i
meant
that
ranjoor
singh
who
is
a
buffalo
should
be
troubled
about
his
troopers
and
suspected
on
his
own
account
for
he
and
i
have
a
private
quarrel
i
did
not
mean
to
catch
him
or
make
use
of
him
but
he
walked
into
the
trap
what
shall
be
done
with
him
let
the
sahib
say
the
word
and
her
gesture
was
inimitable
not
so
the
gurgle
that
she
gave
for
a
man
breath
bubbling
through
the
blood
of
a
slit
throat
makes
the
same
shuddersome
sound
exactly
the
general
took
no
notice
whatever
of
that
for
wise
men
of
the
west
understand
the
east
attempts
to
scandalize
them
it
is
the
everlasting
amusement
of
yasmini
and
a
thousand
others
to
pretend
that
the
english
are
even
more
blood
careless
than
themselves
just
as
it
is
their
practise
to
build
confidently
on
the
opposite
fact
did
fire
the
asked
the
general
suddenly
am
i
a
sweeper
she
retorted
did
you
order
it
done
did
jumna
rise
when
the
rain
came
there
were
six
good
cobras
of
mine
burned
alive
to
say
nothing
of
the
bones
of
a
dead
afridi
nay
sahib
i
ordered
a
clear
trail
left
from
there
to
here
connecting
me
and
thee
and
ranjoor
singh
to
the
germans
and
a
dog
of
an
afridi
murderer
i
left
a
trail
that
even
the
police
could
follow
whose
property
is
that
house
whose
ask
the
lawyers
they
have
fought
about
it
in
the
courts
until
lawyers
own
every
stick
and
stone
of
it
and
now
the
lawyers
fight
one
another
the
government
will
spend
a
year
now
she
laughed
seeking
whom
to
fine
for
the
fire
it
will
be
good
to
see
the
lawyers
run
to
cover
this
is
a
bad
business
said
the
general
sternly
and
he
used
two
words
in
the
native
tongue
that
are
thirty
times
more
expressive
of
badness
as
applied
to
machinations
than
are
the
english
for
them
the
plan
was
to
kidnap
a
trooper
or
two
troopers
to
tempt
him
or
them
and
should
they
prove
incorruptible
to
give
them
certain
work
to
do
and
what
have
you
done
yasmini
laughed
at
him
merry
mocking
laughter
that
stung
him
because
it
was
so
surely
genuine
she
did
not
need
to
tell
him
in
words
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
him
she
could
laugh
in
his
face
and
make
the
truth
sink
deeper
and
now
what
will
the
sahib
do
she
mocked
there
is
war
a
great
war
a
war
of
all
the
world
but
yasmini
fired
a
and
avenged
a
murdered
sikh
first
let
us
punish
yasmini
shall
i
send
for
police
to
arrest
me
sahib
or
shall
i
send
a
maid
in
search
of
babu
sita
ram
that
the
game
may
continue
what
do
you
want
sita
ram
for
sita
ram
is
nearly
always
useful
sahib
he
is
on
a
message
now
he
is
a
fool
who
likes
to
meddle
where
he
none
notice
him
such
are
the
sort
who
cost
least
and
work
the
longest
hours
who
for
instance
sahib
is
to
balk
kirby
sahib
when
he
grows
suspicious
and
begins
to
search
in
earnest
for
his
ranjoor
singh
he
knew
that
ranjoor
singh
was
at
the
there
was
a
man
on
watch
outside
he
will
come
here
next
for
ranjoor
singh
has
been
reported
to
him
as
having
talked
with
germans
in
my
house
reported
by
whom
by
the
afridi
who
is
now
dead
who
killed
the
afridi
does
the
sahib
think
i
killed
him
i
asked
a
question
snapped
the
general
in
the
first
place
then
ranjoor
singh
the
buffalo
struck
the
afridi
with
his
foot
the
afridi
who
was
a
dog
with
yellow
teeth
went
outside
to
sing
sweet
compliments
to
ranjoor
singh
certain
sikhs
heard
him
of
whom
one
was
the
trooper
who
waits
in
another
room
with
ranjoor
singh
and
they
beat
him
nearly
to
death
because
being
buffaloes
themselves
they
love
ranjoor
singh
who
is
the
greatest
buffalo
of
all
for
revenge
the
afridi
told
tales
of
ranjoor
singh
and
later
knifed
one
sikh
trooper
who
had
beaten
him
the
other
trooper
followed
him
into
the
where
he
soon
had
opportunity
for
vengeance
now
the
sahib
knows
all
is
it
not
a
sweet
now
the
sahib
may
arrest
everybody
and
all
will
be
well
where
did
ranjoor
singh
kick
the
afridi
here
in
my
house
then
he
was
here
how
else
would
he
kick
the
man
here
could
he
send
his
foot
by
messenger
was
the
german
here
did
he
have
word
with
the
german
surely
he
spoke
with
him
alone
so
the
afridi
reported
him
to
the
sahib
the
general
frowned
however
deeply
the
military
may
intrigue
they
neither
like
nor
profess
to
like
civilians
who
play
the
same
game
if
ranjoor
singh
is
under
suspicion
what
is
the
use
of
oh
all
men
are
alike
jeered
yasmini
holding
up
the
light
and
looking
more
impudent
than
the
general
had
ever
seen
her
and
he
had
seen
her
often
for
most
of
his
private
information
about
the
regions
north
of
the
himalayas
had
come
through
her
in
one
way
or
another
and
often
enough
from
her
lips
direct
i
have
said
that
ranjoor
singh
is
a
buffalo
he
was
born
a
buffalo
he
has
been
trained
to
be
one
by
the
british
he
likes
to
be
one
and
he
will
die
one
with
a
german
bullet
in
his
belly
unless
this
business
prove
too
much
for
him
and
he
dies
of
fretting
before
he
can
get
away
to
fight
i
look
at
me
sahib
i
have
tempted
ranjoor
singh
and
he
did
not
yield
a
hair
i
stood
closer
to
him
than
i
am
to
you
and
his
pulse
beat
no
faster
all
he
thought
of
was
whether
he
could
crush
me
and
make
me
give
up
my
prisoner
ranjoor
singh
is
a
buffalo
of
buffaloes
a
jat
buffalo
of
no
imagination
and
no
sense
he
is
buffalo
enough
to
love
the
british
raj
and
his
squadron
of
jat
farmers
with
all
his
stupid
sikh
heart
there
not
be
a
better
for
the
purpose
than
this
ranjoor
singh
he
is
stupid
enough
and
nearly
blunt
enough
to
be
an
englishman
he
is
just
of
the
very
caliber
to
fool
a
german
trust
me
sahib
i
who
picked
the
man
who
that
do
said
the
general
and
yasmini
laughed
again
like
the
tinkling
of
a
silver
bell
there
came
then
a
soft
rap
on
the
door
it
opened
about
six
inches
and
a
maid
whispered
wait
ordered
yasmini
come
through
wait
here
she
pulled
the
maid
through
the
door
to
the
little
back
landing
did
you
hear
she
hissed
excitedly
she
says
kirby
sahib
has
come
and
another
with
him
she
was
twitching
with
excitement
her
fingers
clutched
the
sleeve
and
he
found
himself
thinking
of
his
youth
he
released
her
fingers
gently
and
she
spared
a
giggle
for
him
bad
business
said
the
general
again
kirby
will
ask
questions
and
go
away
but
the
troopers
of
ranjoor
singh
squadron
will
come
later
and
they
will
not
go
away
in
such
a
hurry
you
can
fool
colonel
kirby
sahib
but
you
can
not
fool
a
hundred
troopers
no
she
purred
she
had
done
thinking
and
was
herself
again
impudent
and
artful
i
can
fool
anybody
and
any
thousand
men
i
have
sent
sita
ram
already
with
a
message
to
the
troopers
of
ranjoor
singh
squadron
the
message
was
supposed
to
be
from
him
and
it
was
worded
just
as
he
would
have
worded
it
presently
sita
ram
will
come
back
when
he
has
helped
himself
to
payment
then
i
can
send
him
with
yet
another
message
go
and
put
thoughts
into
the
buffalo
head
general
sahib
and
be
quick
there
must
be
a
message
a
written
message
from
ranjoor
singh
to
kirby
sahib
and
a
token
forget
not
the
token
in
proof
that
the
writing
is
not
forged
forget
not
the
token
there
must
surely
be
a
token
she
pushed
the
general
forward
down
a
passage
through
a
series
of
doors
and
down
another
passage
halted
him
while
she
fitted
a
strange
native
key
into
a
lock
opened
another
door
and
pushed
him
through
then
she
ran
back
to
her
maid
send
somebody
to
find
sita
ram
bid
him
hurry
when
he
comes
put
him
in
the
small
room
next
the
cobras
and
let
him
be
shown
the
cobras
until
fear
of
too
much
talking
has
grown
greater
in
him
than
the
love
of
being
heard
then
let
me
see
him
in
a
mirror
so
that
i
may
know
when
it
is
time
have
cobras
in
a
ready
close
behind
where
the
sahibs
sit
and
watch
through
the
hangings
for
my
signal
both
sahibs
will
kneel
to
me
then
watch
for
another
signal
and
let
all
lights
be
blown
out
instantly
or
if
the
sahibs
do
not
kneel
though
they
then
watch
yet
more
closely
for
a
signal
which
i
will
give
to
extinguish
lights
so
now
go
am
i
beautiful
are
my
eyes
bright
twist
me
that
jasmine
in
my
hair
so
now
run
i
will
surprise
them
through
the
hangings
so
yasmini
surprised
kirby
and
his
adjutant
as
has
been
told
and
it
need
not
be
repeated
how
she
humbled
the
pride
of
india
army
on
their
knees
she
would
have
to
forego
the
delight
of
being
yasmini
before
she
could
handle
any
situation
or
plan
any
coup
along
ordinary
lines
and
kirby
and
his
adjutant
were
not
the
first
englishmen
nor
likely
to
be
the
last
to
feed
her
merriment
the
general
for
his
part
had
even
although
pushed
without
ceremony
through
a
door
behaved
with
perfect
confidence
for
he
knew
that
whatever
her
whim
or
her
sense
of
humor
or
her
impudence
yasmini
would
not
fail
him
in
the
pinch
even
she
whose
jest
it
is
to
see
men
writhe
under
her
hand
has
to
own
somebody
her
master
and
though
she
would
giggle
at
the
notion
of
fearing
any
one
man
or
any
dozen
she
does
fear
the
representative
of
what
she
and
perhaps
a
hundred
others
call
the
game
for
the
night
and
for
the
place
the
general
was
that
representative
and
however
much
he
might
disapprove
he
had
no
doubt
of
her
ranjoor
singh
stood
aghast
at
sight
of
him
and
the
trooper
saluted
like
an
automaton
since
nothing
save
obedience
was
any
affair
of
his
evening
smiled
the
general
salaam
general
sahib
to
save
time
i
will
tell
you
that
i
know
stage
by
stage
how
you
got
here
ranjoor
singh
looked
suspicious
for
years
he
had
watched
british
justice
work
and
british
justice
gives
both
sides
a
hearing
he
had
not
told
his
own
version
yet
i
know
that
you
have
had
word
in
another
part
of
this
house
with
a
german
who
pretends
to
be
a
merchant
but
who
is
really
a
spy
ranjoor
singh
looked
even
more
suspicious
the
charge
was
true
though
so
he
did
not
answer
your
being
brought
to
this
house
was
part
of
a
plan
part
of
the
same
plan
that
leaves
the
german
still
at
liberty
you
are
wanted
to
take
further
part
in
it
general
sahib
am
i
an
officer
of
the
raj
or
am
i
dreaming
ranjoor
singh
had
found
his
tongue
at
last
and
the
general
noted
with
keen
pleasure
that
eye
voice
and
manner
were
angry
and
unafraid
i
command
a
squadron
sahib
unless
i
have
been
stricken
mad
since
when
is
a
squadron
commander
brought
in
a
carriage
out
of
by
a
woman
to
do
a
general
bidding
that
has
been
my
fate
now
i
am
wanted
to
take
further
part
is
my
honor
not
yet
dirtied
enough
general
sahib
i
will
take
no
further
part
i
refuse
to
obey
i
order
this
trooper
not
to
obey
i
demand
court
martial
i
see
i
better
begin
with
an
apology
smiled
the
general
he
was
not
trying
to
pretend
he
felt
comfortable
nay
sahib
i
would
accept
no
apology
it
must
first
be
proved
to
me
that
he
who
tells
me
i
am
wanted
to
take
further
part
in
this
treachery
is
not
a
traitor
to
the
raj
i
have
read
of
generals
turning
traitors
i
have
read
about
napoleon
i
know
how
his
generals
behaved
when
the
sand
in
his
glass
seemed
run
i
am
for
the
raj
in
this
and
in
any
other
hour
i
refuse
to
obey
or
to
accept
apology
let
the
explanation
be
made
me
at
court
martial
with
colonel
kirby
sahib
present
to
bear
witness
to
my
character
as
you
were
the
general
eyes
met
those
of
the
sikh
officer
and
neither
could
have
told
then
or
at
any
other
time
what
exactly
it
was
that
each
man
recognized
ranjoor
singh
when
i
entered
this
house
ten
minutes
ago
i
had
no
notion
i
should
find
you
here
i
have
served
the
same
with
you
on
the
same
campaigns
i
even
wear
the
same
medals
in
the
same
house
i
am
entitled
to
the
same
credit
i
am
here
on
urgent
business
for
the
raj
and
you
are
here
owing
to
a
grave
mistake
which
i
admit
and
for
which
i
tender
you
the
most
sincere
apology
on
behalf
of
the
government
but
which
i
can
not
alter
i
expected
to
find
a
trooper
here
not
necessarily
of
your
regiment
who
should
have
been
waylaid
and
tempted
beyond
any
doubt
as
to
his
trustworthiness
i
received
a
message
that
yasmini
had
two
absolutely
honest
men
ready
and
i
came
at
once
to
give
them
their
instructions
i
ask
you
to
sacrifice
your
pride
as
we
all
of
us
must
on
occasion
and
your
rights
as
is
a
soldier
privilege
and
see
this
business
through
to
a
finish
it
is
too
late
to
make
other
arrangements
ranjoor
singh
sahib
is
my
trade
i
am
not
cut
out
for
soldiering
i
am
willing
to
leave
this
house
and
hold
my
tongue
and
to
take
this
trooper
with
me
and
see
that
he
holds
his
tongue
by
nine
tomorrow
morning
i
will
have
satisfied
myself
that
you
are
for
and
not
against
the
raj
and
having
satisfied
myself
i
and
this
trooper
here
will
hold
our
tongues
for
ever
the
general
stood
as
still
on
his
square
foot
of
floor
as
did
ranjoor
singh
on
his
it
was
the
fact
that
he
did
not
flinch
and
did
not
strut
about
but
stood
in
one
spot
with
his
arms
behind
him
that
confirmed
ranjoor
singh
in
his
reading
of
the
general
eye
you
may
leave
the
house
then
and
take
your
trooper
i
accept
your
promise
before
you
go
though
i
tell
you
something
the
ordering
of
troops
for
the
front
for
france
is
in
my
hands
your
regiment
is
slated
for
but
it
ca
go
unless
you
see
this
through
the
whole
regiment
will
be
needed
instead
to
mount
guard
over
delhi
the
regiment
is
to
go
sahib
and
my
squadron
and
and
i
not
i
am
not
to
go
that
is
the
sacrifice
you
are
asked
to
make
have
i
made
no
sacrifices
for
the
raj
how
has
my
life
been
spent
sahib
the
sikh
voice
broke
and
he
ceased
speaking
but
the
general
too
seemed
at
a
loss
for
words
sahib
do
i
understand
if
i
do
this
this
whatever
it
is
colonel
kirby
and
the
regiment
go
and
another
leads
my
squadron
and
unless
i
do
this
whatever
it
is
the
regiment
will
not
go
the
general
nodded
he
felt
and
looked
ashamed
has
war
been
declared
sahib
yes
germany
has
invaded
belgium
for
a
second
the
sikh
eyes
blazed
but
the
fire
died
down
again
he
clasped
his
hands
in
front
of
him
and
hung
his
head
i
will
do
this
thing
that
i
am
asked
to
do
he
said
but
his
words
were
scarcely
audible
his
trooper
came
a
step
closer
to
be
nearer
to
him
in
his
minute
of
acutest
agony
thou
and
i
jagut
singh
we
both
stay
behind
now
i
want
you
to
listen
you
promised
like
a
man
said
the
general
i
make
you
the
best
promise
i
can
in
return
mine
conditional
but
it
none
the
less
emphatic
if
possible
you
shall
catch
your
regiment
before
it
puts
to
sea
if
that
impossible
you
shall
take
passage
on
another
ship
and
try
to
overtake
it
if
that
again
is
impossible
you
shall
follow
your
regiment
and
be
in
france
in
time
to
lead
your
squadron
i
think
i
may
say
you
are
sure
to
be
there
before
the
regiment
goes
into
action
but
understand
i
said
possible
ranjoor
singh
eye
brightened
and
he
straightened
perceptibly
this
trooper
sahib
my
promise
is
for
him
as
well
we
accept
sahib

is
the
duty

ranjoor
singh

wiser
and
no
more
loyal
officer
nor
any
officer
more
pugnacious
on
his
juniors
account
i
assure

the
use

making
of
you

to
his
protests
write
man

give
me
the
paper
and
the
pen
sahib
ranjoor
singh
wrote
by
the
light
of
a
flickering
oil
lamp
using
his
trooper
shoulder
for
support
he
passed
the
finished
note
back
to
the
general
now
some
token
please
that
colonel
kirby
will
be
sure
to
recognize
something
to
prove
that
the
note
is
not
forged
ranjoor
singh
pulled
a
ring
from
his
finger
and
held
it
out
colonel
kirby
sahib
gave
me
this
he
said
simply
thanks
shake
hands

talking

men

my
life

this
letter
to
somebody

until
all
this
is
over
please
do
what
yasmini

from
me
or
can
see
for
yourself
that
your
task
is
finished
depend
on
me
to
remember
my
promise
ranjoor
singh
saluted
although
he
was
not
in
uniform
the
general
answered
his
salute
and
left
the
room
to
be
met
by
a
maid
who
took
the
note
and
the
ring
from
him
five
minutes
later
with
his
rough
disguise
resumed
the
general
hunted
about
among
the
shadows
of
the
neighboring
streets
until
he
had
found
his
carriage
he
recognized
but
was
not
recognized
by
the
risaldar
on
the
of
colonel
kirby
shay
teeth
of
a
wolf
on
a
whitened
bone
what
do
the
splinters
say

of
a
sambur
up
and
gone
where
will
he
stand
at
bay
sparks
in
the
whirl
of
a
hurrying
wind
who
was

laid
the

back
of
a

chapter
xii
black
smoke
still
billowed
upward
from
the
gutted
and
although
there
were
few
stars
visible
a
watery
moon
looked
out
from
between
dark
cloudracks
and
showed
up
the
smoke
above
the
delhi
roofs
yasmini
picked
the
right
simile
as
usual
it
looked
as
if
the
biggest
genie
ever
dreamed
of
must
be
hurrying
out
of
a
fisherman
vase
and
who
is
the
fisherman
she
laughed
for
she
is
fond
of
that
sort
of
question
that
sets
those
near
her
thinking
and
disguises
the
trend
of
her
own
thoughts
as
utterly
as
if
she
had
not
any
the
genie
might
be
the
spirit
of
war
ventured
a
baluchi
forgetting
the
one
god
of
his
koran
in
a
sententious
effort
to
please
yasmini
she
flashed
a
glance
at
him
or
it
might
be
the
god
of
the
rekis
she
suggested
and
everybody
chuckled
because
baluchis
do
not
relish
reference
to
their
lax
religious
practise
any
more
than
they
like
to
be
called
desert
people
this
man
was
a
rind
baluch
of
the
marri
hills
and
proud
of
it
but
pride
is
not
always
an
asset
at
yasmini
they
and
the
police
would
have
dearly
loved
to
know
exactly
who
they
were
stood
clustered
in
yasmini
great
deep
window
that
overlooks
her
garden
the
garden
that
can
not
be
guessed
at
from
the
street
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
could
have
explained
how
they
came
to
assemble
all
on
that
side
of
the
room
the
movement
had
seemed
to
evolve
out
of
the
infinite
calculation
that
everybody
takes
for
granted
and
moslems
particularly
since
there
seems
nothing
else
to
do
about
it
it
did
not
occur
to
anybody
to
credit
yasmini
with
the
arrangement
or
with
the
suddenly
aroused
interest
in
smoke
against
the
sky
yet
when
another
man
entered
whose
disguise
was
a
joke
to
any
practised
eye
and
all
in
the
room
were
practised
it
looked
to
the
newcomer
almost
as
if
his
reception
had
been
ready
staged
he
was
dressed
as
a
mohammedan
gentleman
but
his
feet
when
he
stood
still
made
nearly
a
right
angle
to
each
other
and
his
shoulders
had
none
of
the
grace
that
goes
with
good
native
breeding
they
were
proud
enough
but
the
pride
had
been
drilled
in
and
cultivated
it
sat
square
and
if
a
native
gentleman
had
walked
through
the
streets
as
this
man
walked
all
the
small
boys
of
the
bazaars
would
have
followed
him
to
learn
what
nation
his
might
be
yasmini
seemed
delighted
with
him
she
ran
toward
him
curtsied
to
him
and
called
him
she
made
two
maids
bring
a
chair
for
him
and
made
them
set
it
near
the
middle
of
the
window
whence
he
could
see
the
smoke
pushing
the
men
away
on
either
side
until
he
had
a
clear
view
but
he
knew
enough
of
the
native
mind
at
all
events
to
look
at
the
smoke
and
not
remark
on
it
it
was
so
obvious
that
he
was
meant
to
talk
about
the
smoke
or
to
ask
about
it
that
even
a
german
orientalist
understanding
the
east
through
german
eyes
had
tact
enough
to
look
in
silence
and
so
to
speak
force
trumps
and
that
again
of
course
was
exactly
what
yasmini
wanted
moreover
she
surprised
him
by
not
leading
trumps
they
are
here
she
said
with
a
glance
at
the
more
than
thirty
men
who
crowded
near
the
window
the
german
and
he
made
no
pretense
any
longer
of
being
anything
but
german
sat
sidewise
with
both
hands
on
his
knees
to
get
a
better
view
of
them
he
scanned
each
face
carefully
and
each
man
entertained
a
feeling
that
he
had
been
analyzed
and
ticketed
and
stood
aside
i
have
seen
all
these
before
he
said
they
are
men
of
the
north
and
good
enough
fighters
i
have
no
doubt
but
they
are
not
what
i
asked
for
how
many
of
these
are
trained
soldiers
which
of
these
could
swing
the
allegiance
of
a
single
native
regiment
it
is
time
now
for
proofs
and
deeds
the
hour
of
talk
is
gone
bring
me
a
soldier
these
also
say
it
is
all
talk
sahib
words
words
words
they
say
they
will
wait
until
the
fleet
that
has
been
spoken
of
comes
to
bombard
the
coast
for
the
present
there
are
none
to
rally
round
yet
you
hinted
at
soldiers
said
the
german
you
hinted
at
a
regiment
ready
to
revolt
aye
sahib
i
have
repeated
what
say
when
the
soldier
comes
there
shall
be
other
talk
see
yonder
smoke
now
then
it
was
time
to
notice
things
and
the
german
gazed
over
the
garden
and
delhi
walls
and
roofs
at
what
looked
very
much
more
important
than
it
really
was
it
looked
as
if
at
least
a
street
must
be
on
fire
he
made
that
holocaust
did
the
soldier
yasmini
manner
was
of
blended
awe
and
admiration
he
was
suspected
of
disloyalty
he
entered
that
house
to
make
arrangements
for
the
mutiny
of
a
whole
regiment
of
sikhs
who
are
not
willing
to
be
sent
to
fight
across
the
sea
he
was
followed
to
the
house
and
so
since
he
would
not
be
taken
he
burned
all
the
houses
such
a
man
is
he
who
comes
presently
did
the
sahib
hear
the
mob
roar
when
the
flames
burst
out
at
evening
no
a
pity
there
were
many
soldiers
in
the
mob
and
many
thousand
discontented
people
she
went
close
to
the
window
to
be
between
the
german
and
the
light
and
let
him
see
her
silhouetted
in
an
attitude
of
hope
awakening
she
gazed
at
the
billowing
smoke
as
if
the
hope
of
india
were
embodied
in
it
it
was
thus
in
she
said
darkly
men
began
with
burnings
brown
eyes
behind
the
german
exchanged
glances
for
the
east
is
chary
of
words
when
it
does
not
understand
the
german
nodded
for
he
had
studied
history
and
was
sure
he
understood
sahib
said
a
sudden
woman
voice
and
yasmini
started
as
if
taken
by
surprise
there
were
those
in
the
room
who
knew
that
when
taken
by
surprise
she
never
started
but
they
were
not
german
he
is
here
she
whispered
and
the
german
showed
that
he
felt
a
crisis
had
arrived
he
settled
down
to
meet
it
like
a
soldier
and
a
man
salaam
purred
yasmini
in
her
silveriest
voice
as
ranjoor
singh
strode
down
the
middle
of
the
room
with
the
dignity
the
west
may
some
day
learn
see
whispered
yasmini
he
trusts
nobody
he
brings
his
own
guard
with
him
by
the
door
at
which
he
had
entered
stood
a
trooper
of
d
squadron
outram
own
no
longer
in
uniform
but
dressed
as
a
sikh
servant
the
man
arms
were
folded
on
his
breast
the
rigidity
straight
stature
and
attitude
appealed
to
the
german
as
the
sight
of
sea
did
to
the
ancient
greeks
salaam
said
ranjoor
singh
the
german
noticed
that
his
eyes
glowed
but
the
rest
of
him
was
all
calm
dignity
we
have
met
before
said
the
german
rising
you
are
the
sikh
with
whom
i
spoke
the
other
night
the
sikh
officer
the
squadron
leader
ja
said
ranjoor
singh
and
the
one
word
startled
the
german
so
that
he
caught
his
breath
sie
sprechen
deutsch
ja
wohl
the
german
muttered
something
half
under
his
breath
that
may
have
been
meant
for
a
compliment
to
ranjoor
singh
but
the
missed
it
for
he
had
stepped
up
to
the
nearest
of
the
northern
gentlemen
and
confronted
him
there
was
a
great
show
of
looking
in
each
other
eyes
and
muttering
under
the
breath
some
word
and
each
made
a
sign
with
his
right
hand
then
with
his
left
that
the
german
could
not
see
and
then
ranjoor
singh
stepped
side
wise
to
the
next
man
man
by
man
slowly
and
with
care
he
looked
each
man
present
in
the
eyes
and
tested
him
for
the
password
while
yasmini
watched
admiringly
any
who
do
not
know
the
word
will
die
she
whispered
and
the
german
nodded
because
it
was
evident
that
the
northerners
were
quite
afraid
he
approved
of
that
kind
of
discipline
these
are
all
true
men
patriots
said
ranjoor
singh
walking
back
to
him
now
say
what
you
have
to
say
began
the
german
speak
hindustani
that
they
all
may
understand
said
ranjoor
singh
and
the
others
gathered
closer
my
friend
i
am
told
but
yasmini
broke
in
bursting
between
ranjoor
singh
and
the
german
nay
let
the
sahibs
go
alone
into
the
other
room
neither
will
speak
his
mind
freely
before
company
is
it
not
so
into
the
other
room
sahibs
while
we
wait
here
ranjoor
singh
bowed
and
the
german
clicked
his
heels
together
ranjoor
singh
made
a
sign
but
the
german
yielded
precedence
so
ranjoor
singh
strode
ahead
and
the
german
followed
him
wishing
to
high
heaven
he
could
learn
to
walk
with
such
consummate
grace
as
they
disappeared
through
the
jingling
the
sikh
trooper
followed
them
and
took
his
stand
again
with
folded
arms
by
the
the
german
saw
him
and
smiled
he
approved
of
that
then
yasmini
gathered
her
thirty
curious
northerners
together
around
her
and
proceeded
to
entertain
them
while
the
plot
grew
nearer
to
its
climax
in
another
room
she
led
them
back
to
the
divans
by
the
inner
wall
she
set
them
to
smoking
while
she
sang
a
song
to
them
she
parried
their
questions
with
dark
hints
and
innuendoes
that
left
them
more
mystified
than
ever
yet
no
man
would
admit
he
could
not
understand
and
then
she
danced
to
them
she
danced
for
an
hour
to
the
wild
minor
music
that
her
women
made
and
she
seemed
to
gather
strength
and
lightness
as
the
night
wore
on
near
dawn
the
german
and
ranjoor
singh
came
out
together
to
find
her
yet
dancing
and
she
ceased
only
to
pull
the
german
aside
and
speak
to
him
does
he
speak
german
she
whispered
he
he
has
read
nietzsche
and
von
bernhardi
in
the
german
who
are
they
they
are
difficult
to
read
philosophers
has
he
satisfied
you
he
has
promised
that
he
will
then
go
before
i
send
the
rest
away
so
the
german
tried
to
look
like
a
mohammedan
again
and
went
below
to
a
waiting
landau
before
he
was
down
the
stairs
hands
gripped
tight
on
ranjoor
singh
forearms
and
she
had
him
backed
into
a
corner
ranjoor
singh
thou
art
no
buffalo
i
was
wrong
thou
are
a
great
man
ranjoor
singh
she
received
no
answer
what
hast
thou
promised
him
to
show
him
a
mutinous
regiment
of
sikhs
and
what
has
he
promised
to
show
me
what
we
seek
she
nodded
good
she
said
so
now
i
promise
thee
something
said
ranjoor
singh
sternly
i
shall
eat
black
shame
on
thy
account
for
this
is
thy
doing
later
i
will
go
to
france
later
again
i
will
come
back
and
and
love
me
as
they
all
do
laughed
yasmini
pushing
him
away
if
i
must
lie
who
love
the
truth
and
honour
bids
me
lie
i
tell
a
lordly
lie
forsooth
to
be
remembered
by
if
i
must
cheat
whose
fame
is
fair
and
fret
my
fame
away
i
do
worse
than
the
devil
dare
that
men
may
rue
the
day
chapter
xiii
beyond
question
yasmini
is
a
craftsman
of
amazing
skill
and
her
genius
as
does
all
true
genius
extends
to
the
almost
infinite
consideration
of
small
details
the
medium
in
which
she
works
human
weakness
affords
her
unlimited
opportunity
and
she
owns
the
trick
that
most
great
artists
win
of
not
letting
her
general
plan
be
known
before
the
climax
neither
friend
nor
enemy
is
ever
quite
sure
which
is
which
until
she
solves
the
problem
to
the
enemy
confusion
but
yasmini
could
have
failed
in
this
case
through
overmuch
finesse
she
was
not
used
to
germans
and
could
not
realize
until
too
late
that
her
compliance
with
this
man
every
demand
only
served
to
make
him
more
peremptory
and
more
in
his
point
of
view
from
a
mere
agent
offering
the
almost
unimaginable
in
return
for
mere
promises
he
had
grown
already
into
a
dictator
demanding
action
as
a
prelude
to
reward
he
had
even
threatened
to
cause
her
yasmini
to
be
reported
to
the
police
unless
she
served
his
purpose
better
if
she
had
obeyed
the
general
and
had
picked
a
trooper
for
the
business
in
hand
it
is
likely
that
yasmini
would
have
had
to
write
a
failure
to
her
account
she
had
come
perilously
near
to
obedience
on
this
occasion
and
it
had
been
nothing
less
than
luck
that
put
ranjoor
singh
into
her
hands
luck
being
the
pet
name
of
india
kindest
god
ranjoor
singh
was
needed
in
the
instant
when
he
came
to
bring
the
german
back
to
earth
and
a
due
sense
of
proportion
the
sikh
had
a
rage
in
his
heart
that
the
german
mistook
for
zeal
and
native
ferocity
his
manners
became
so
brusk
under
the
stress
of
it
that
they
might
almost
have
been
prussian
and
met
with
its
own
reflection
that
kind
of
insolence
grows
limp
having
agreed
to
lie
ranjoor
singh
lied
with
such
audacity
and
so
much
skill
that
it
would
have
needed
yasmini
to
dare
disbelieve
him
the
german
sat
in
state
near
yasmini
great
window
and
received
one
after
another
liars
by
the
dozen
from
the
hills
where
lies
are
current
coin
some
of
them
had
listened
to
his
lectures
and
some
had
learned
of
them
at
second
hand
every
man
of
them
had
received
his
cue
from
yasmini
there
was
too
much
unanimity
among
them
they
wanted
too
little
and
agreed
too
readily
to
what
the
german
had
to
say
he
was
growing
almost
suspicious
toward
ten
when
ranjoor
singh
came
in
there
was
no
trooper
behind
him
this
time
for
the
man
had
been
sent
to
watch
for
the
regiment
departure
and
to
pounce
then
on
bagh
the
charger
and
take
him
away
to
safety
after
the
charger
had
been
groomed
and
fed
and
hidden
the
trooper
was
to
do
what
might
be
done
toward
securing
the
kit
but
under
no
condition
was
the
kit
to
have
precedence
groom
him
until
he
shines
guard
him
until
i
call
for
him
keep
him
exercised
was
the
order
that
sang
through
the
head
and
overcame
astonishment
in
the
hurry
to
obey
now
it
was
the
german
turn
to
be
astonished
ranjoor
singh
strode
in
dressed
as
a
sikh
farmer
and
frowned
down
yasmini
instant
desire
to
poke
fun
at
him
the
german
rose
to
salute
him
and
the
sikh
acknowledged
the
salute
with
a
nod
such
as
royalty
might
spare
for
a
menial
come
he
said
curtly
and
the
german
followed
him
out
through
the
door
to
the
where
so
many
mirrors
were
there
ranjoor
singh
made
quite
a
little
play
of
making
sure
they
were
not
overheard
while
the
german
studied
his
own
mohammedan
disguise
from
twenty
different
angles
too
much
finery
growled
ranjoor
singh
i
will
attend
to
that
first
listen
other
than
your
talk
i
have
had
no
proof
at
all
of
you
you
are
a
spy
i
am
a
you
are
a
spy
all
the
spies
i
ever
met
were
liars
from
the
ground
up
i
am
a
patriot
i
am
working
to
save
my
country
from
a
yoke
that
is
unbearable
and
i
deal
in
subterfuge
and
treachery
if
i
would
win
but
you
are
merely
one
who
sows
trouble
you
are
like
the
little
jackal
the
dirty
little
jackal
who
starts
a
fight
between
two
tigers
so
that
he
may
fill
his
mean
belly
do
speak
listen
the
german
jaw
had
dropped
but
not
because
words
rushed
to
his
lips
he
seemed
at
a
loss
for
them
you
made
me
an
offer
and
i
accepted
it
continued
ranjoor
singh
i
accepted
it
on
behalf
of
india
i
shall
show
you
in
about
an
hour
from
now
a
native
regiment
one
of
the
very
best
native
regiments
so
mutinous
that
its
officers
must
lead
it
out
of
delhi
to
a
camp
where
it
will
be
less
dangerous
and
less
likely
to
corrupt
others
the
german
nodded
he
had
asked
no
more
then
if
you
fail
to
fulfill
your
part
said
ranjoor
singh
grimly
i
shall
lock
you
in
the
cellar
of
this
house
where
yasmini
keeps
her
cobras
vorwarts
laughed
the
german
for
there
was
conviction
in
every
word
the
sikh
had
said
i
will
show
you
how
a
german
keeps
his
bargain
a
german
growled
ranjoor
singh
a
german
germany
is
nothing
to
me
if
germany
can
pick
the
bones
i
leave
what
do
i
care
one
does
not
bargain
with
a
spy
either
one
pays
his
price
and
throws
him
to
the
cobras
if
he
fail
come
the
question
of
precedence
no
longer
seemed
to
trouble
ranjoor
singh
he
turned
his
back
without
apology
and
as
the
german
followed
him
there
came
a
giggle
from
behind
the
curtains
were
we
overheard
he
asked
but
ranjoor
singh
did
not
seem
to
care
any
more
and
did
not
trouble
to
answer
him
outside
the
door
was
a
of
the
kind
in
which
women
make
long
journeys
with
a
painted
covered
the
german
followed
ranjoor
singh
into
it
and
without
any
need
for
orders
the
sikh
driver
began
to
twist
the
bullocks
tails
and
send
them
along
at
the
pace
all
india
loves
then
ranjoor
singh
began
to
pay
attention
to
the
german
dress
pulling
off
his
expensive
turban
and
replacing
that
and
his
clothes
with
cheaper
dirtier
ones
why
asked
the
german
i
will
show
you
why
said
ranjoor
singh
then
they
sat
back
each
against
a
side
of
the
cart
squatting
native
style
this
regiment
that
i
will
show
you
is
mine
said
ranjoor
singh
i
command
a
squadron
of
it
or
rather
did
until
i
became
suspected
every
man
in
the
regiment
is
mine
and
will
follow
me
at
a
word
when
i
give
the
word
they
will
kill
their
english
officers
he
leaned
his
head
out
of
the
opening
to
spit
there
seemed
something
in
his
mouth
that
tasted
nasty
why
did
they
mutiny
asked
the
german
ordered
to
france
said
ranjoor
singh
with
lowered
eyes
for
a
while
there
was
silence
as
the
cart
bumped
through
the
muddy
rutty
streets
the
only
sound
that
interfered
with
thought
was
the
driver
voice
apostrophizing
the
bullocks
and
the
abuse
he
poured
on
them
was
so
as
to
be
unnoticeable
like
the
cawing
of
the
city
crows
it
is
strange
said
the
german
after
a
while
for
years
i
have
tried
to
get
in
touch
with
native
officers
here
and
there
i
have
found
a
sepoy
who
would
talk
with
me
but
you
are
the
first
officer
he
was
talking
almost
to
himself
he
did
not
see
the
curse
in
the
eyes
i
have
found
plenty
of
merchants
who
would
promise
to
finance
revolt
and
plenty
of
hillmen
who
would
promise
anything
but
all
said
will
do
what
the
army
does
and
i
could
not
find
in
all
this
time
among
all
those
people
anybody
to
whom
i
dared
show
what
we
germany
can
do
to
help
i
have
seen
from
the
first
it
was
only
with
the
aid
of
the
army
that
we
could
accomplish
anything
yet
the
army
has
been
unapproachable
how
is
it
that
you
have
seemed
so
loyal
all
of
you
until
the
minute
of
war
ranjoor
singh
spat
again
through
the
opening
with
thoroughness
and
great
deliberation
then
he
proceeded
to
give
proof
that
as
yasmini
had
said
he
was
really
not
a
buffalo
at
all
a
fool
would
have
taken
chances
with
any
one
of
a
dozen
other
explanations
ranjoor
singh
with
an
expression
that
faintly
suggested
colonel
kirby
picked
the
right
convincing
one
the
english
are
not
bad
people
he
said
simply
they
have
left
india
better
than
they
found
it
they
have
been
unselfish
they
have
treated
us
soldiers
fairly
and
honorably
we
would
not
have
revolted
had
the
opportunity
not
come
but
we
have
long
been
waiting
for
the
opportunity
we
are
not
madmen
we
are
soldiers
we
know
the
value
of
mere
words
we
have
kept
our
plans
secret
from
the
merchants
and
the
hillmen
knowing
well
that
they
would
all
follow
our
lead
if
you
think
that
you
or
germany
have
persuaded
us
you
are
mistaken
you
could
not
persuade
me
or
any
other
true
soldier
if
you
tried
for
fifty
years
it
is
because
we
had
decided
on
revolt
already
that
i
was
willing
to
listen
to
your
offer
of
material
assistance
we
understand
that
germany
expects
to
gain
advantage
from
our
revolt
but
we
can
not
help
that
that
is
incidental
as
soldiers
we
accept
what
aid
we
can
get
from
anywhere
so
said
the
german
ja
said
ranjoor
singh
and
that
is
why
if
you
fail
me
i
shall
give
you
to
yasmini
cobras
you
will
admit
said
the
german
when
i
have
shown
you
that
germany
foresight
has
been
long
and
shrewd
your
great
chance
of
success
my
friend
like
germany
in
this
war
depends
on
a
sudden
swift
tremendous
success
at
first
the
rest
will
follow
as
a
logical
corollary
it
is
the
means
of
securing
that
first
success
that
we
have
been
making
ready
for
you
for
two
years
and
more
you
should
have
credit
for
great
secrecy
admitted
ranjoor
singh
until
a
little
while
ago
i
had
heard
nothing
of
any
german
plans
russia
got
the
blame
for
what
little
was
guessed
at
laughed
the
german
oh
said
ranjoor
singh
a
little
before
midday
they
reached
the
ajmere
gate
and
the
lumbering
cart
passed
under
it
at
the
farther
side
the
driver
stopped
his
oxen
without
orders
and
ranjoor
singh
stepped
out
looking
quickly
up
and
down
the
road
there
were
people
about
but
none
whom
he
chose
to
favor
with
a
second
glance
close
by
the
gate
almost
under
the
shadow
of
it
and
so
drab
and
dirty
as
to
be
almost
unnoticeable
there
was
a
little
booth
with
a
stock
of
lemonade
and
sweetmeats
that
did
interest
him
he
looked
three
times
at
it
and
at
the
third
look
a
mohammedan
wriggled
out
of
it
and
walked
away
without
a
word
come
commanded
ranjoor
singh
and
the
german
got
out
of
the
cart
looking
not
so
very
much
unlike
the
poor
mohammedan
who
had
gone
away
get
in
there
the
german
slipped
into
the
real
owner
place
so
far
as
appearances
went
he
was
a
very
passable
sweetmeat
and
lemonade
seller
and
ranjoor
singh
proved
competent
to
guard
against
contingencies
he
picked
a
long
stick
out
of
the
gutter
and
took
his
stand
near
by
frowning
as
he
saw
a
carriage
he
suspected
to
be
yasmini
drive
under
the
gate
and
come
to
a
stand
at
the
roadside
fifty
or
sixty
yards
away
if
the
officers
should
recognize
me
he
growled
to
the
german
though
seeming
not
to
talk
to
him
at
all
i
should
be
arrested
at
once
and
shot
later
but
the
men
recognize
me
and
you
shall
see
what
you
shall
see
three
small
boys
came
with
a
coin
to
spend
but
ranjoor
singh
drove
them
away
with
his
long
stick
they
argued
shrilly
from
a
distance
and
one
threw
a
stone
at
him
but
finally
they
decided
he
was
some
new
sort
of
constabeel
and
went
away
one
after
another
several
natives
came
to
make
small
purchases
but
not
being
boys
any
longer
a
gruff
word
was
enough
to
send
them
running
and
then
came
the
clatter
of
hoofs
of
the
and
the
german
looked
up
to
see
a
fire
in
ranjoor
singh
eyes
that
a
caged
tiger
could
not
have
outdone
all
this
while
the
in
which
they
had
come
remained
in
the
middle
of
the
road
its
driver
dozing
dreamily
on
his
seat
and
the
bullocks
perfectly
content
to
chew
the
cud
at
the
sound
of
the
hoofs
behind
him
the
driver
suddenly
awoke
and
began
to
belabor
and
kick
his
animals
he
seemed
oblivious
of
another
cart
that
came
toward
him
and
of
a
third
that
hurried
after
him
from
underneath
the
gate
in
less
than
sixty
seconds
all
three
carts
were
neatly
interlocked
and
their
respective
drivers
were
engaged
in
a
war
of
words
that
beggared
babel
the
halted
and
added
words
to
the
torrent
colonel
kirby
caught
up
the
and
halted
too
does
he
look
like
a
man
who
commands
a
loyal
regiment
asked
ranjoor
singh
and
the
german
studied
the
bowed
head
and
thoughtful
angle
of
a
man
who
at
that
minute
was
regretting
his
good
friend
the
you
will
note
that
he
looks
chastened
the
german
nodded
in
his
own
good
time
ranjoor
singh
ran
out
and
helped
with
that
long
stick
of
his
to
straighten
out
the
mess
then
in
thirty
seconds
the
wheels
were
unlocked
again
and
the
carts
moving
in
a
hurry
to
the
roadside
the
moved
on
and
kirby
followed
then
troop
by
troop
the
whole
of
outram
own
rode
by
and
the
german
began
to
wonder
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
rest
of
the
officers
were
not
demure
enough
although
he
admitted
to
himself
that
the
enigmatic
eastern
faces
in
the
ranks
might
mean
anything
at
all
he
noted
that
there
was
almost
no
talking
and
he
took
that
for
a
good
sign
for
germany
d
squadron
came
last
of
all
and
convinced
him
they
rode
regretfully
as
men
who
missed
their
squadron
leader
and
who
in
spite
of
a
message
from
him
would
have
better
loved
to
see
him
riding
on
their
flank
but
ranjoor
singh
stepped
out
into
the
road
and
the
man
of
the
front
four
recognized
him
not
a
word
was
said
that
the
german
could
hear
but
he
could
see
the
recognition
run
from
rank
to
rank
and
troop
to
troop
until
the
squadron
knew
to
a
man
he
saw
them
glance
at
ranjoor
singh
and
from
him
to
one
another
and
ride
on
with
a
new
stiffening
and
a
new
air
of
now
we
see
what
comes
of
it
it
was
as
evident
to
his
practised
eye
that
they
were
glad
to
have
seen
ranjoor
singh
and
looked
forward
to
seeing
him
again
very
shortly
as
that
they
were
in
a
mood
for
trouble
and
he
decided
to
believe
the
whole
of
what
the
sikh
had
said
on
the
strength
of
the
obvious
truth
of
part
of
it
watch
now
the
supply
train
growled
ranjoor
singh
as
the
wagons
began
to
rumble
by
the
german
had
no
means
of
knowing
that
the
greater
part
of
the
regiment
war
provisions
had
gone
away
by
train
from
a
delhi
station
the
wagons
that
followed
the
regiment
on
the
march
were
a
generous
allowance
for
a
regiment
going
into
camp
but
not
more
than
that
the
spies
whose
duty
it
was
to
watch
the
railway
sidings
reported
to
somebody
else
and
not
to
him
ranjoor
singh
beckoned
him
after
a
while
and
they
came
out
into
the
road
to
stand
between
two
of
the
and
gaze
after
the
regiment
the
shuttered
carriage
that
ranjoor
singh
had
suspected
to
be
yasmini
passed
them
again
and
the
man
beside
the
driver
said
something
to
ranjoor
singh
in
an
undertone
but
the
german
did
not
hear
it
he
was
watching
the
colonel
and
another
officer
talking
together
beside
the
road
in
the
distance
the
shuttered
carriage
passed
on
but
stopped
in
the
shadow
of
the
gate
look
said
the
german
i
thought
that
officer
the
adjutant
he
recognized
you
now
he
is
pointing
you
out
to
the
colonel
look
ranjoor
singh
did
look
and
he
saw
that
colonel
kirby
was
waiting
to
let
the
regiment
go
by
he
knew
what
was
passing
through
kirby
mind
since
it
is
given
to
some
men
native
and
english
to
have
faith
in
each
other
and
he
knew
that
there
was
danger
ahead
of
him
through
which
he
might
not
come
with
his
life
perhaps
even
with
his
honor
he
would
have
given
like
kirby
a
full
year
pay
for
a
then
and
have
thought
the
pay
well
spent
kirby
began
to
canter
back
he
has
recognized
you
said
the
german
and
he
is
coming
to
cut
me
down
swore
ranjoor
singh
he
dragged
the
german
back
behind
the
nearest
cart
and
together
they
ran
for
the
gloom
of
the
big
gate
leaving
the
driver
of
the
standing
at
gaze
where
ranjoor
singh
had
stood
the
door
of
the
shuttered
carriage
flew
open
as
they
reached
it
and
ranjoor
singh
pushed
the
german
in
he
stood
a
moment
longer
with
his
foot
on
the
carriage
step
watching
colonel
kirby
he
watched
him
question
the
driver
then
a
voice
that
he
recognized
said
buffalo
and
he
followed
into
the
carriage
shutting
the
door
behind
him
the
carriage
was
off
almost
before
the
door
slammed
am
i
to
be
kept
waiting
for
a
week
while
a
jat
farmer
gazes
at
cattle
on
the
road
demanded
yasmini
sitting
forward
out
of
the
darkest
corner
of
the
carriage
and
throwing
aside
a
veil
he
cares
nothing
for
thee
she
whispered
didst
thou
see
the
jasmine
drop
into
his
lap
from
the
gate
that
was
mine
didst
thou
see
him
button
it
into
his
tunic
so
ranjoor
singh
that
for
thy
colonel
sahib
and
his
head
will
smell
of
musk
for
a
week
to
come
what
what
fools
men
are
jaldee
she
called
to
the
driver
through
the
shutters
and
the
man
whipped
up
his
pair
it
was
more
than
scandalous
to
be
driven
through
delhi
streets
in
a
shuttered
carriage
with
a
native
lady
and
even
the
german
presence
scarcely
modified
the
sensation
the
german
did
not
appreciate
the
rarity
of
his
privilege
for
he
was
too
busy
staring
through
the
shutters
at
a
world
which
tried
its
best
to
hide
excitement
but
ranjoor
singh
was
aware
all
the
time
of
yasmini
mischievous
eyes
and
of
mirth
that
held
her
all
but
speechless
he
knew
that
she
would
make
up
tales
about
that
ride
and
would
have
told
them
to
half
of
india
to
his
enduring
shame
before
a
year
was
out
are
you
satisfied
she
asked
the
german
after
a
long
silence
of
what
asked
the
german
that
ranjoor
singh
sahib
can
do
what
he
has
promised
the
german
laughed
i
have
an
excuse
for
doing
what
i
promised
he
said
if
that
is
what
you
mean
that
regiment
said
ranjoor
singh
since
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
lie
thoroughly
will
camp
a
day
march
out
of
delhi
the
men
will
wait
to
hear
from
me
for
a
day
or
two
but
after
that
they
will
mutiny
and
be
done
with
it
the
men
are
almost
out
of
hand
with
excitement
you
mean
the
german
eyebrows
rose
and
his
eyes
sought
ranjoor
singh
i
mean
that
now
is
the
time
to
do
your
part
that
i
may
continue
doing
mine
he
answered
what
i
have
to
offer
would
be
of
no
use
without
the
regiment
to
use
it
said
the
german
let
the
regiment
mutiny
and
i
will
lead
you
and
it
at
once
to
what
i
spoke
of
no
said
ranjoor
singh
what
then
it
does
not
suit
my
plan
or
my
convenience
that
there
should
be
any
outbreak
until
i
myself
have
knowledge
of
all
my
resources
when
everything
is
in
my
hand
i
will
strike
hard
and
fast
in
my
own
good
time
you
seem
to
forget
said
the
german
that
the
material
aid
i
offer
is
from
germany
and
that
therefore
germany
has
a
right
to
state
the
terms
of
course
i
know
there
are
the
cobras
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
them
our
stipulation
is
that
there
shall
be
at
least
a
show
of
fight
before
aid
is
given
if
the
cobras
deal
with
me
and
my
secret
dies
with
me
there
will
be
one
german
less
and
that
is
all
that
regiment
i
have
seen
looks
ripe
for
mutiny
ranjoor
singh
drew
breath
slowly
through
set
teeth
let
it
mutiny
said
the
german
and
i
am
ready
with
such
material
assistance
as
will
place
delhi
at
its
mercy
delhi
is
the
key
to
india
it
shall
mutiny
said
ranjoor
singh
abruptly
the
german
stared
hard
at
him
though
not
so
hard
as
yasmini
the
chief
difference
was
that
nobody
could
have
told
she
was
staring
whereas
the
german
gaped
it
shall
mutiny
and
you
shall
be
there
you
shall
lead
us
then
to
this
material
aid
you
promise
and
after
that
if
it
all
turns
out
to
be
a
lie
as
i
suspect
we
will
talk
about
cobras
for
a
minute
two
minutes
three
minutes
while
the
rubber
tires
bumped
along
the
road
toward
yasmini
the
german
sat
in
silence
looking
straight
in
front
of
him
order
horses
for
him
and
me
commanded
ranjoor
singh
and
yasmini
bowed
obedience
when
will
you
start
the
german
asked
now
in
twenty
minutes
we
will
follow
the
regiment
and
reach
camp
soon
after
it
i
must
speak
first
with
my
colleagues
said
the
german
no
growled
the
sikh
my
secret
information
is
that
several
regiments
are
ordered
oversea
some
of
them
will
consent
to
go
my
friend
we
will
do
well
to
wait
until
as
many
regiments
as
possible
are
on
the
water
and
then
strike
hard
with
the
aid
of
such
as
have
refused
to
go
the
carriage
drew
up
at
yasmini
front
door
and
a
man
jumped
off
the
box
seat
to
open
the
carriage
say
the
rest
inside
she
ordered
go
into
the
house
quickly
so
the
german
stepped
out
first
moving
toward
the
door
much
too
spryly
for
the
type
of
street
merchant
he
was
supposed
to
be
do
you
mean
that
whispered
yasmini
as
she
pushed
past
ranjoor
singh
do
you
mean
to
ride
away
with
him
and
stage
a
mutiny
how
can
you
he
answered
with
the
first
low
laugh
she
had
heard
from
him
since
the
game
began
she
ran
into
the
house
and
all
the
way
up
the
two
steep
flights
of
stairs
laughing
like
a
dozen
peals
of
fairy
bells
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
she
began
to
sing
for
she
looked
back
and
saw
babu
sita
ram
waddling
wheezily
after
ranjoor
singh
and
the
german
the
gods
surely
love
yasmini
she
told
her
maids
catch
me
that
babu
and
bottle
him
drive
him
into
a
room
where
i
can
speak
with
him
alone
oh
my
god
my
god
wailed
the
babu
at
the
from
amid
a
maze
of
women
who
hustled
and
shoved
him
all
one
way
and
that
the
way
he
did
not
want
to
go
i
must
speak
with
that
german
gentleman
who
was
giving
lecture
here
must
positivelee
give
him
warning
or
all
his
hopes
will
be
blasted
everlastinglee
no
that
is
room
where
are
cobras
i
will
not
go
there
in
three
native
languages
one
after
the
other
he
pleaded
and
wailed
to
no
good
end
the
women
were
too
many
for
him
he
was
shoved
into
a
small
room
as
a
fat
beast
is
driven
into
a
and
a
door
was
slammed
shut
on
him
he
screamed
at
an
unexpected
voice
from
behind
a
curtain
and
a
moment
later
burst
into
a
sweat
from
reaction
at
the
sight
of
yasmini
listen
she
purred
to
him
who
was
that
man
asking
for
me
demanded
the
german
how
should
i
know
snorted
ranjoor
singh
are
we
to
turn
aside
for
every
fat
babu
that
asks
to
speak
to
us
i
have
sent
for
horses
i
will
speak
with
that
man
said
the
german
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
long
room
pushing
aside
the
cushions
irritably
and
at
one
end
knocking
over
a
great
bowl
of
flowers
he
did
not
appear
conscious
of
his
clumsiness
and
did
not
seem
to
see
the
maids
who
ran
to
mop
up
the
water
at
the
next
turn
down
the
room
he
pushed
between
them
as
if
they
had
not
been
there
ranjoor
singh
stood
watching
him
stroking
a
black
beard
reflectively
he
was
perfectly
sure
that
yasmini
would
make
the
next
move
and
was
willing
to
wait
for
it
the
horses
should
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
he
said
hopefully
after
a
while
for
he
heard
a
door
open
then
babu
sita
ram
burst
in
half
running
and
holding
his
great
stomach
as
he
always
did
when
in
a
hurry
oh
my
god
he
wailed
quick
where
is
german
gentleman
and
not
knowing
german
how
shall
i
make
meaning
clear
german
should
be
reckoned
among
dead
languages
and

the
german
gave
him
some
paper
money
impatiently
the
babu
unfolded
it
eyed
the
denomination
with
a
spasm
of
relief
folded
it
again
and
appeared
to
stow
it
into
his
capacious
stomach
sahib
while
i
was
watching
police
came
up
at
march
and
arrested
everybodee
including
all
germans
in
building
there
was
much
annoyance
manifested
when

to

of

with
notice
regarding

for
breaking
same
and
also
police
sentry
at
door
looking
more
unlike
a
mohammedan
street
vender
than
ever
the
german
began
to
pace
the
room
again
with
truly
martial
strides
frowning
as
he
sought
through
the
recesses
of
his
mind
for
the
correct
solution
of
the
problem
listen
he
said
coming
to
a
stand
in
front
of
ranjoor
singh
i
have
changed
my
mind
the
horses
are
ready
answered
ranjoor
singh
the
german
government
has
been
to
huge
expense
to
provide
aid
of
the
right
kind
to
be
ready
at
the
right
minute
my
sole
business
is
to
see
that
the
utmost
use
is
made
of
it
that

my
sole
business

ranjoor
singh

after
me
ranjoor
singh
nodded

you
get
away
from
here
unseen
unknown
to
the
police
ranjoor
singh
nodded
again
for
he
was
very
sure
of
yasmini
resource
again
the
german
began
to
pace
the
room
now
with
his
hands
behind
him
now
with
folded
arms
now
with
his
chin
down
to
his
breast
and
now
with
a
high
chin
as
he
seemed
on
the
verge
of
reaching
some
determination
and
then
yasmini
began
to
loose
the
flood
of
her
resources
that
ranjoor
singh
might
make
use
of
what
he
chose
she
was
satisfied
to
leave
the
german
in
the
sikh
hands
and
to
squander
aid
at
random
men
began
to
come
in
one
at
a
time
they
would
whisper
to
ranjoor
singh
and
hurry
out
again
some
of
them
would
whisper
to
yasmini
over
in
the
window
and
she
would
give
them
mock
messages
to
carry
very
seriously
babu
sita
ram
was
stirred
out
of
a
meditative
coma
and
sent
hurrying
away
to
come
back
after
a
little
while
and
wring
his
hands
he
ran
over
to
yasmini
it
is
awful
he
wailed
soon
there
will
be
no
troops
left
with
which
to
quell
mohammedan
uprising
all
loyal
troops
are
leaving
and
none
but
disloyal
men
are
left
behind
the
government
is
mad
and
i
am
veree
much
afraid
yasmini
quieted
him
and
ranjoor
singh
pretending
to
be
busy
with
other
messengers
noted
the
effect
of
the
babu
wail
on
the
german
he
judged
the
change
of
mind
had
gone
far
enough
we
should
lose
time
by
following
my
regiment
he
said
at
last
there
are
now
five
more
regiments
ready
to
mutiny
and
they
will
come
to
me
to
wherever
i
send
for
them
the
german
blue
eyes
gazed
into
the
sikh
brown
ones
very
shrewdly
and
very
long
his
hand
sought
the
neighborhood
of
his
hip
and
dwelt
there
a
moment
longer
than
the
sikh
thought
necessary
i
have
decided
we
must
hurry
he
said
i
will
show
you
what
i
have
to
show
i
will
not
be
taking
chances
you
must
bring
a
messenger
and
he
must
go
for
your
mutineers
while
you
stay
there
with
me
when
we
are
there
you
will
be
in
my
power
until
the
regiments
come
and
when
they
come
i
will
surrender
to
you
do
you
agree
yes
said
ranjoor
singh
then
choose
your
messenger
choose
a
man
who
will
not
try
to
play
tricks
a
man
who
will
not
warn
the
authorities
because
if
there
is
any
slip
any
trickery
i
will
undo
in
one
second
all
that
has
been
done
so
ranjoor
singh
conferred
with
yasmini
over
the
two
great
bowls
of
flowers
that
always
stand
in
her
big
window
and
she
suppressed
a
squeal
of
excitement
while
she
watched
the
german
resume
his
pacing
up
and
down
take
sita
ram
she
advised
ranjoor
singh
scowled
at
the
babu
that
fat
bellyful
of
fear
he
growled
i
would
rather
take
a
pig
all
the
same
take
sita
ram
she
advised
so
the
babu
was
roused
again
out
of
a
comfortable
snooze
and
yasmini
whispered
to
him
something
that
frightened
him
so
much
that
he
trembled
like
a
man
with
palsy
i
am
married
man
with
children
he
expostulated
i
will
be
kind
to
your
widow
purred
yasmini
i
will
not
go
vowed
the
babu
put
him
in
the
cobra
room
she
commanded
and
some
maids
came
closer
to
obey
i
will
go
said
sita
ram
but
oh
my
god
a
man
should
receive
pecuniary
recompense
far
greater
than
legendary
ransom
i
shall
not
come
back
alive
i
know
i
shall
not
come
back
alive
who
cares
asked
yasmini
true
said
sita
ram
this
is
land
of
and
with
my
big
stomach
i
am
often
last
i
am
veree
full
of
fear
we
shall
need
food
interposed
the
german
water
will
be
there
but
we
had
better
have
sufficient
food
with
us
for
two
nights
yasmini
gave
a
sharp
order
and
several
of
her
maids
ran
out
of
the
room
ten
minutes
later
they
returned
with
three
baskets
and
gave
one
each
to
the
german
to
ranjoor
singh
and
to
sita
ram
sita
ham
opened
his
and
peered
in
the
german
opened
his
looked
pleased
and
closed
the
lid
again
ranjoor
singh
accepted
his
at
its
face
value
and
did
not
open
it
may
the
memsahib
never
lack
plenty
from
which
to
give
he
said
for
there
is
no
word
for
thank
you
in
all
india
i
will
bless
the
memsahib
at
each
mouthful
said
sita
ram
truly
a
bellyful
of
blessings
laughed
yasmini
then
they
all
went
to
the
and
watched
and
listened
through
the
open
door
while
a
closed
carriage
was
driven
away
in
a
great
hurry
three
maids
and
six
men
came
one
after
another
at
intervals
to
report
the
road
all
clear
the
first
carriage
had
not
been
followed
and
there
was
nobody
watching
another
carriage
waited
babu
sita
ram
was
sent
downstairs
to
get
into
the
waiting
carriage
and
stay
there
on
the
lookout
now
bring
him
better
clothes
said
ranjoor
singh
but
yasmini
had
anticipated
that
order
they
are
in
the
carriage
on
the
seat
she
said
so
the
german
went
and
climbed
in
beside
the
babu
changing
his
turban
at
once
for
the
better
one
that
he
found
waiting
in
there
this
performance
is
worth
a
rajah
ransom
grumbled
babu
sita
ram
will
sahib
not
put
elbow
in
my
belly
seeing
same
is
highly
sensitive
but
the
german
laughed
at
him
love
is
rare
sickness
asserted
sita
ram
with
conviction
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
ranjoor
singh
and
yasmini
stood
looking
into
each
other
eyes
he
looked
into
pools
of
laughter
and
mystery
that
told
him
nothing
at
all
she
saw
a
man
heart
glowing
in
his
brown
ones
it
will
be
for
you
now
said
ranjoor
singh
to
act
with
speed
and
all
discretion
i
do
know
what
we
are
going
to
see
although
i
know
it
is
artillery
of
some
sort
i
am
sure
he
has
a
plan
for
destroying
every
trace
of
whatever
it
is
and
of
himself
and
me
if
he
suspects
treachery
i
know
no
more
i
can
only
go
ahead
and
trust
me
said
yasmini
the
sikh
did
not
answer
and
trust
me
repeated
yasmini
i
will
save
you
out
of
this
ranjoor
singh
sahib
that
we
may
fight
our
quarrel
to
a
finish
later
on
what
would
the
world
be
without
enemies
you
will
not
find
artillery
how
do
you
know
i
have
known
for
nearly
two
years
what
you
will
find
there
my
friend
only
i
have
not
known
exactly
where
to
find
it
and
yet
sometimes
i
have
thought
that
i
have
known
that
too
go
ranjoor
singh
you
will
be
in
danger
above
all
do
not
try
to
force
that
german
hand
too
far
until
i
come
with
aid
it
is
better
to
talk
than
fight
so
long
as
the
enemy
is
strongest
woman
swore
ranjoor
singh
so
savagely
that
she
laughed
straight
into
his
face
if
you
suspect
if
you
can
guess
where
we
are
going
send
men
to
surround
the
place
and
watch
will
a
tiger
walk
into
a
watched
lair
she
answered
go
talker
go
and
do
things
so
swearing
and
dissatisfied
ranjoor
singh
went
down
and
climbed
on
to
the
box
seat
of
a
carriage
which
way
he
asked
and
the
german
growled
an
answer
through
the
shutters
now
straight
on
said
the
german
after
fifteen
minutes
straight
on
out
of
delhi
they
were
headed
south
and
driving
very
slowly
for
to
have
driven
fast
would
have
been
to
draw
attention
to
themselves
ranjoor
singh
scarcely
troubled
to
look
about
him
and
sita
ram
fell
into
a
doze
in
spite
of
his
protestations
of
fear
the
german
was
the
only
one
of
the
party
who
was
at
pains
to
keep
a
lookout
and
he
was
most
exercised
to
know
whether
they
were
being
followed
over
and
over
again
he
called
on
ranjoor
singh
to
stop
until
a
following
carriage
should
overtake
them
and
pass
on
so
they
were
a
very
long
time
driving
to
old
delhi
where
the
ruins
of
old
cities
stand
piled
against
one
another
in
a
tangled
mass
of
verdure
that
is
hardly
penetrable
except
where
the
tracks
wind
in
and
out
the
shadow
of
the
kutb
minar
was
long
when
they
drove
past
it
and
it
was
dusk
when
the
german
shouted
and
ranjoor
singh
turned
the
horses
in
between
two
trees
and
drew
rein
at
a
shattered
temple
door
some
monkeys
loped
away
chattering
and
about
a
thousand
parakeets
flew
off
shrilling
for
another
roost
but
there
was
no
other
sign
of
life
stable
the
horses
in
here
said
the
german
and
they
did
so
ranjoor
singh
dipping
water
out
of
a
and
filling
a
stone
trough
that
had
once
done
duty
as
receptacle
for
gifts
for
a
god
then
they
pushed
the
carriage
under
a
tangle
of
hanging
branches
look
about
you
advised
the
german
as
he
emptied
food
for
the
horses
on
the
temple
floor
and
babu
sita
ram
made
very
careful
note
of
the
temple
bearings
while
ranjoor
singh
and
the
german
blocked
the
old
doorway
with
whatever
they
could
find
to
keep
outside
and
the
horses
in
then
the
german
led
the
way
into
the
dark
swinging
a
lantern
that
he
had
unearthed
from
some
recess
babu
sita
ram
walked
second
complaining
audibly
and
shuddering
at
every
shadow
last
came
ranjoor
singh
grim
silent
and
the
rain
beat
down
on
all
three
of
them
until
they
were
drenched
and
numb
and
their
feet
squelched
in
mud
at
every
step
for
all
the
darkness
ranjoor
singh
made
note
of
the
fact
that
they
were
following
a
wagon
track
into
which
the
wheels
of
a
native
cart
had
sunk
deep
times
without
number
only
native
leave
a
track
like
that
it
must
have
been
nine
and
the
babu
was
giving
signs
of
nearly
complete
exhaustion
when
they
passed
beyond
a
ring
of
trees
into
a
clearing
they
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
in
a
shadow
for
about
ten
minutes
while
the
german
watched
catwise
for
signs
of
life
it
is
now
he
said
tapping
ranjoor
singh
chest
that
you
begin
to
be
at
my
mercy
i
assure
you
that
the
least
disobedience
on
your
part
will
mean
your
instant
death
lead
on
growled
ranjoor
singh
do
you
recognize
the
place
ranjoor
singh
peered
through
the
rain
in
every
direction
at
each
corner
of
the
clearing
north
south
east
and
west
he
could
dimly
see
some
sort
of
ruined
arch
and
there
was
another
ruin
in
the
center
no
he
said
this
is
the
oldest
temple
ruin
anywhere
near
delhi
on
some
inscriptions
it
is
called
of
the
four
winds
but
the
old
hindu
who
lived
in
it
before
we
bribed
him
to
go
away
called
it
the
of
the
world
it
is
known
as
of
the
world
on
the
books
of
the
german
war
office
i
think
it
is
really
of
greek
origin
myself
but
i
am
not
an
orientalist
and
the
all
say
that
i
am
wrong
lead
on
said
ranjoor
singh
and
the
german
led
them
swinging
his
lantern
and
seeming
not
at
all
afraid
of
being
seen
now
we
have
taken
steps
quite
often
to
make
the
people
hereabouts
believe
this
temple
haunted
he
said
they
avoid
it
at
night
as
if
the
devil
lived
here
if
any
of
them
see
my
lantern
they
will
not
stop
running
till
they
reach
the
sea
they
came
to
a
ruin
that
was
such
an
utter
ruin
that
it
looked
as
if
an
earthquake
must
have
shaken
a
temple
to
pieces
to
be
disintegrated
by
the
weather
but
ranjoor
singh
noticed
that
the
wound
around
the
side
of
it
and
when
they
came
to
a
fairly
large
teak
half
hidden
by
creepers
he
was
not
much
surprised
my
god
gentlemen
said
sita
ram
that
place
is
refuge
for
many
million
cobras
if
i
must
die
i
will
prefer
to
perish
in
rain
where
wife
and
family
may
find
me
for
proper
funeral
rites
i
will
not
go
in
there
but
the
german
raised
the
and
ranjoor
singh
took
the
unhappy
babu
by
the
scruff
of
his
fat
neck
in
with
you
he
ordered
and
chattering
as
if
his
teeth
were
castanets
the
babu
trod
gingerly
down
damp
stone
steps
whose
center
had
been
worn
into
ruts
by
countless
feet
the
german
came
last
and
let
the
trap
slam
shut
my
god
yelled
the
babu
let
me
go
i
am
family
man
laughed
the
german
leading
the
way
toward
a
teak
door
set
in
a
stone
wall
they
were
in
an
ancient
temple
vault
that
seemed
to
have
miraculously
escaped
from
the
destruction
that
had
overwhelmed
the
whole
upper
part
not
a
stone
of
it
was
out
of
place
it
was
wind
and
and
the
vaulted
roof
that
above
was
nothing
better
than
a
mound
of
debris
from
below
looked
nearly
as
perfect
as
when
the
stones
had
first
been
fitted
into
place
the
german
produced
a
long
key
opened
the
teak
door
and
stood
aside
to
let
them
pass
no
no
shuddered
sita
ram
but
ranjoor
singh
pushed
him
through
the
german
followed
and
the
door
slammed
shut
as
the
trap
had
done
and
now
my
friends
i
will
convince
you
said
the
german
holding
the
lantern
high
what
are
those
the
light
from
the
solitary
lantern
fell
on
rows
and
rows
of
bales
arranged
in
neat
straight
lines
until
away
in
the
distance
it
suggested
endless
other
shadowy
bales
whose
outlines
could
be
little
more
than
guessed
at
they
were
in
a
vault
so
huge
that
ranjoor
singh
made
no
attempt
to
estimate
its
size
see
this
said
the
german
walking
close
to
something
on
a
wooden
stand
and
he
held
the
light
above
it
in
the
office
in
delhi
that
the
police
have
just
sealed
up
there
is
a
wireless
apparatus
very
much
like
this
this
that
you
see
here
is
a
detonator
this
is
fulminate
of
mercury
this
is
dynamite
with
a
touch
of
a
certain
key
in
delhi
we
could
have
blown
up
this
vault
at
any
minute
of
the
past
two
years
if
we
had
thought
it
necessary
to
hide
our
tracks
a
shot
from
this
pistol
would
have
much
the
same
effect
he
added
darkly
but
the
bales
asked
ranjoor
singh
what
is
in
the
bales
dynamite
bombs
my
friend
you
native
soldiers
have
no
artillery
and
we
have
seen
from
the
first
the
necessity
of
supplying
a
substitute
by
making
full
use
of
the
element
of
surprise
these
bombs
should
serve
your
purpose
there
are
one
million
of
them
packed
two
hundred
in
a
bale
much
more
useful
than
artillery
in
the
hands
of
untrained
men
those
look
like
bales
of
blankets
they
are
cotton
blankets
from
only
the
middle
blankets
have
been
omitted
and
the
outer
ones
have
served
as
a
cushion
to
prevent
accidental
discharge
they
have
been
imported
in
small
lots
at
a
time
and
brought
here
four
or
five
at
a
time
in
from
one
or
other
of
the
delhi
railway
stations
by
men
who
are
no
longer
in
this
part
of
india
men
who
have
been
pensioned
off
how
did
you
get
them
through
the
customs
wondered
ranjoor
singh
did
you
ever
see
a
rabbit
go
into
his
hole
the
german
asked
they
were
very
small
consignments
obviously
of
blankets
the
duty
was
paid
without
demur
and
the
price
paid
the
customs
men
was
worth
their
while
that
part
was
easy
of
what
size
are
the
bombs
asked
ranjoor
singh
about
the
size
of
an
orange
come
i
show
you
he
led
him
to
an
opened
bale
and
showed
him
two
hundred
of
them
nestling
like
the
eggs
of
some
big
bird
my
god
moaned
sita
ram
are
those
dynamite
sahibs
snakes
are
better
snakes
can
feel
afraid
but
those
ow
let
me
go
away
let
him
go
said
the
german
let
him
take
his
message
go
then
ordered
ranjoor
singh
and
the
german
walked
to
the
door
to
let
him
out
what
is
your
message
he
asked
to
yasmini
first
for
she
is
in
touch
with
all
of
them
said
sita
ram
first
i
will
go
to
yasmini
then
she
will
come
here
to
say
the
regiments
have
started
first
she
will
come
alone
after
her
the
regiments
she
had
better
be
alone
said
the
german
go
on
run
and
forget
the
way
back
wait
how
will
she
know
the
way
how
will
you
describe
it
to
her
she
describe
it
to
her
i
will
tell
her
winds
of
the
world
and
she
will
come
straight
how
how
will
she
know
the
priest
who
used
to
be
here
whom
you
bribed
to
go
away
he
is
her
night
doorkeeper
now
said
sita
ram
yes
she
will
come
veree
quickly
the
german
let
him
out
with
an
air
mixed
of
surprise
and
disbelief
and
returned
to
ranjoor
singh
with
far
less
iron
in
his
stride
though
with
no
less
determination
now
we
shall
see
he
said
drawing
an
automatic
pistol
and
cocking
it
carefully
this
is
not
meant
as
a
personal
threat
to
you
so
long
as
we
two
are
in
here
alone
it
in
case
of
trickery
from
outside
i
shall
blow
this
place
if
anything
goes
wrong
if
the
regiments
come
good
you
shall
have
the
bombs
if
they
do
come
or
if
a
trick
played
click
we
argue
the
rest
in
heaven
very
well
said
ranjoor
singh
and
to
show
how
little
he
felt
concerned
he
drew
his
basket
to
him
and
began
to
eat
the
german
followed
suit
then
ranjoor
singh
took
most
of
his
wet
clothes
off
and
spread
them
upon
the
bales
to
dry
the
german
imitated
that
too
go
to
sleep
if
you
care
to
said
the
german
i
shall
stand
watch
he
added
with
a
dry
laugh
but
if
a
sikh
soldier
can
not
manage
without
sleep
there
is
nobody
on
earth
who
can
ranjoor
singh
sat
back
against
a
bale
and
the
watch
resolved
itself
into
a
contest
of
endurance
with
the
end
by
no
means
in
sight
how
long
should
it
take
that
man
to
reach
her
asked
the
german
who
knows
the
sikh
answered
perhaps
three
hours
perhaps
a
week
she
is
never
still
and
there
are
those
five
regiments
to
hold
in
readiness
she
is
a
wonderful
woman
said
the
german
ranjoor
singh
grunted
how
is
it
that
she
has
known
of
this
place
all
this
time
and
yet
has
never
tried
to
meddle
with
us
i
too
am
anxious
to
know
that
said
ranjoor
singh
you
are
surly
my
friend
you
do
not
like
this
pistol
you
take
it
as
an
insult
is
that
it
i
am
thinking
of
those
regiments
and
of
these
grenades
and
of
what
i
mean
to
do
said
ranjoor
singh
let
us
talk
it
over
no
please
your
self
they
sat
facing
each
other
for
hour
after
dreary
hour
leaning
back
against
bales
and
thinking
each
his
own
thoughts
after
about
four
hours
of
it
it
occurred
to
the
german
to
dismantle
the
wireless
detonator
we
should
have
been
blown
up
if
the
police
had
grown
inquisitive
he
said
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
returning
to
his
seat
after
that
they
sat
still
for
four
hours
more
and
then
put
their
clothes
on
not
that
they
were
dry
yet
but
the
german
had
grown
tired
of
comparing
ranjoor
singh
better
physique
with
his
own
he
put
his
clothes
on
to
hide
inferiority
and
ranjoor
singh
followed
suit
for
the
sake
of
manners
what
rank
do
you
hold
in
your
army
at
home
asked
ranjoor
singh
after
an
almost
endless
interval
if
i
told
you
that
my
friend
you
would
be
surprised
i
think
not
said
ranjoor
singh
i
think
you
are
an
officer
who
was
dismissed
from
the
service
what
makes
you
think
so
i
am
sure
of
it
what
makes
you
sure
you
are
too
well
educated
for
a
noncommissioned
officer
if
you
had
not
been
dismissed
from
the
service
you
would
be
on
the
fighting
strength
or
else
in
the
reserve
and
ready
for
the
front
in
europe
and
what
army
keeps
spies
of
your
type
on
its
strength
am
i
right
but
then
came
yasmini
carrying
her
as
the
rest
had
done
she
knocked
at
the
outer
and
the
german
ran
to
peep
through
a
hidden
window
at
her
then
he
went
up
a
partly
ruined
stair
and
looked
all
around
the
clearing
through
gaps
in
the
debris
overhead
that
had
been
glazed
for
protection
sake
then
he
admitted
her
she
ran
in
past
him
ran
past
him
again
when
he
opened
the
second
door
and
laughed
at
ranjoor
singh
she
seemed
jubilant
and
very
little
interested
in
the
bombs
that
the
german
was
at
pains
to
explain
to
her
she
had
to
tell
of
five
regiments
on
the
way
the
first
will
be
here
in
two
or
three
hours
she
asserted
your
men
ranjoor
singh
your
jat
sikhs
that
are
ever
first
to
mutiny
she
squealed
delight
as
the
sikh
face
flushed
at
the
insult
what
is
the
cocked
pistol
for
she
asked
the
german
he
told
her
but
she
did
not
seem
frightened
in
the
least
she
began
to
sing
and
her
voice
echoed
strangely
through
the
vault
until
she
herself
seemed
to
grow
hypnotized
by
it
and
she
began
to
sway
pushing
her
basket
away
from
her
behind
a
bale
near
where
the
german
sat
i
will
dance
for
you
she
said
suddenly
she
arose
and
produced
a
little
wind
instrument
from
among
her
clothing
a
little
wooden
thing
with
a
voice
like
scots
bagpipes
out
of
the
way
ranjoor
singh
she
ordered
sit
yonder
i
will
dance
between
you
so
that
the
german
sahib
may
watch
both
of
us
at
once
so
ranjoor
singh
went
back
twenty
feet
away
wondering
at
her
mood
and
wondering
even
more
what
trick
she
meant
to
play
he
had
reached
the
conclusion
very
reluctantly
that
presently
the
german
would
fire
that
pistol
of
his
and
end
the
careers
of
all
three
of
them
so
he
was
thinking
of
the
squadron
on
its
way
to
france
in
a
way
he
was
sorry
for
yasmini
but
it
was
the
squadron
and
colonel
kirby
that
drew
his
swaying
to
and
fro
from
the
waist
upward
yasmini
began
to
play
her
little
instrument
the
echoing
vault
became
a
solid
sea
of
throbbing
noise
and
as
she
played
she
increased
her
speed
of
movement
until
the
german
sat
and
gaped
he
had
seen
her
dance
on
many
more
than
one
occasion
so
had
ranjoor
singh
never
had
either
of
them
or
any
living
man
seen
yasmini
dance
as
she
did
that
night
she
was
a
storm
her
instrument
was
but
an
added
touch
of
artistry
to
heighten
the
suggestion
prom
a
slow
rhythmic
swing
she
went
by
gusts
and
fits
and
starts
to
the
wildest
utterly
abandoned
fury
of
a
hurricane
sweeping
a
wide
circle
with
her
gauzy
dress
and
at
the
height
of
each
elemental
climax
in
of
some
new
amazing
figure
she
would
set
her
instrument
to
screaming
until
the
german
shouted
bravo
and
ranjoor
singh
nodded
grave
approval
blitzen
swore
the
german
suddenly
leaping
to
his
feet
and
staggering
and
yasmini
pounced
on
him
ranjoor
singh
could
not
see
what
had
happened
but
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
ran
toward
them
but
before
he
could
reach
them
yasmini
had
snatched
the
german
pistol
and
tossed
it
to
him
standing
back
from
the
writhing
german
panting
with
blazing
eyes
and
looking
too
lovely
to
be
human
she
did
not
speak
she
looked
and
ranjoor
singh
looked
too
under
the
writhing
german
and
back
again
over
him
there
crawled
a
hooded
cobra
seeming
to
caress
the
carcass
of
his
prey
he
will
be
dead
in
five
ten
minutes
said
yasmini
and
then
i
will
catch
my
snake
again
if
you
want
to
ask
him
questions
you
had
better
hurry
then
ranjoor
singh
recalled
the
offices
that
men
had
done
for
him
when
he
was
wounded
he
asked
the
german
if
he
might
send
messages
and
to
whom
but
the
dying
man
seemed
to
be
speechless
and
only
writhed
it
was
nearly
a
minute
before
ranjoor
singh
divined
his
purpose
and
pounced
on
the
hand
that
lay
underneath
him
he
wrenched
away
another
pistol
only
just
in
time
the
snake
crawled
away
and
yasmini
coaxed
it
slowly
back
into
its
basket
now
she
said
when
he
is
dead
we
will
drive
back
to
delhi
and
amuse
ourselves
you
shall
run
away
to
fight
men
you
never
quarreled
with
and
i
will
govern
india
is
that
not
so
ranjoor
singh
did
not
answer
her
he
kept
trying
again
and
again
to
get
some
message
from
the
german
to
send
perhaps
to
a
friend
in
germany
but
the
man
died
speechless
and
ranjoor
singh
could
find
no
scrap
of
paper
on
him
or
no
mark
that
would
give
any
clue
to
his
identity
come
said
yasmini
lock
the
door
on
him
we
will
tell
the
general
sahib
and
the
general
sahib
will
send
some
one
to
bury
him
come
not
yet
said
ranjoor
singh
speak
when
did
you
first
know
that
these
germans
had
taken
this
vault
to
use
more
than
two
years
ago
she
boasted
when
the
old
priest
that
was
no
priest
at
all
came
to
me
to
be
doorkeeper
and
when
did
you
know
that
they
were
storing
dynamite
in
here
i
did
not
know
then
blankets
bah
two
years
ago
when
a
customs
clerk
with
too
much
money
began
to
make
love
to
a
maid
of
mine
then
why
did
you
not
warn
the
government
at
once
and
so
save
all
this
trouble
buffalo
much
fun
that
would
have
been
ranjoor
singh
thy
jat
imagination
does
thee
justice
come
come
and
chase
that
regiment
of
thine
and
spill
those
stupid
brains
in
france
lock
the
door
and
come
away
brother
a
favor
i
came
to
crave
oh
more
than
brother
oh
more
than
friend
spare
me
a
half
o
thy
soldier
grave
that
i
sleep
with
thee
at
the
end
spur
to
spur
and
knee
to
knee
brother
i
ride
to
death
with
thee
chapter
xiv
the
crew
of
the
messageries
maritimes
steamship
will
tell
of
a
tall
sikh
officer
with
many
medals
on
his
breast
who
boarded
their
ship
in
bombay
with
letters
to
the
captain
from
a
british
officer
of
such
high
rank
as
to
procure
him
instant
accession
to
his
request
bound
homeward
from
singapore
the
had
put
into
bombay
for
coal
supplies
and
orders
she
left
with
orders
for
marseilles
and
on
board
her
there
went
this
same
sikh
officer
who
it
seemed
had
missed
the
transport
on
which
his
regiment
had
sailed
he
had
with
him
a
huge
charger
and
one
sikh
trooper
by
way
of
servant
the
charger
tried
to
eat
all
that
came
near
him
including
his
the
ship
crew
and
enough
hay
for
at
least
two
ordinary
horses
but
ranjoor
singh
who
said
very
little
to
anybody
about
anything
had
a
certain
way
with
him
and
men
put
up
with
the
charger
delinquencies
for
its
owner
sake
when
they
reached
the
red
sea
and
the
ship
rolled
less
ranjoor
singh
and
his
trooper
went
to
most
extraordinary
lengths
to
keep
the
charger
in
condition
they
took
him
out
of
his
box
and
walked
him
around
the
decks
for
hours
at
a
time
taking
turns
at
it
until
officer
trooper
and
horse
were
tired
out
they
did
the
same
all
down
the
mediterranean
and
when
they
landed
at
marseilles
the
horse
was
fit
as
he
proved
to
his
own
brute
satisfaction
by
trying
to
kick
the
life
out
of
a
gendarme
on
the
quay
another
letter
from
somebody
very
high
in
authority
to
a
french
general
officer
in
marseilles
procured
the
instant
supply
of
a
horse
for
the
sikh
trooper
and
two
passes
on
a
northbound
train
the
evening
of
their
landing
saw
them
on
their
way
to
the
front
ranjoor
singh
in
a
compartment
and
his
man
in
the
neither
knew
any
french
to
speak
of
but
the
french
were
very
kind
to
these
gentlemen
who
were
in
so
much
hurry
to
help
them
win
the
war
it
was
dark
nearly
pitch
dark
at
the
journey
end
the
moon
shone
now
and
then
through
banks
of
black
clouds
and
showed
long
lines
of
poplar
trees
beyond
in
the
distance
there
was
a
zone
in
which
great
flashes
leaped
and
died
great
savage
streaks
of
fire
of
many
colors
and
a
thundering
that
did
not
cease
at
all
along
the
road
that
ran
between
the
poplars
two
men
sent
their
horses
at
a
rousing
clip
though
not
so
fast
as
to
tax
them
to
the
utmost
the
man
in
front
rode
a
brute
that
lacked
little
of
seventeen
hands
and
that
fought
for
the
bit
as
if
he
would
like
to
eat
the
far
horizon
in
the
very
very
dark
zone
on
the
near
side
of
where
the
splashes
of
red
fire
fell
jingling
bits
and
a
kick
now
and
then
proclaimed
the
presence
of
a
regiment
of
cavalry
nothing
else
betrayed
them
until
one
was
near
enough
to
see
the
whites
of
men
eyes
in
the
dark
for
they
were
native
indian
cavalry
who
know
the
last
of
the
art
of
being
still
between
them
and
the
very
very
dark
zone
which
was
what
the
frenchmen
call
a
forest
and
some
other
nations
call
a
stand
of
timber
a
little
group
of
officers
sat
talking
in
low
tones
eight
englishmen
and
the
others
sikhs
they
say
they
working
round
the
edge
say
they
ca
hold
it
looks
very
much
as
if
we
going
to
get
our
chance
when
a
red
light
flashes
three
times
at
this
near
corner
of
the
woods
to
ride
into
in
line
it
mean
that
our
chaps
are
falling
back
in
a
hurry
leaving
lots
of
room
between
and
the
wood
for
us
to
ride
through
better
join
your
men
you
fellows
oh
lord
what
ranjoor
singh
have
given
to
be
here

came
a
challenge
from
the
rear

horsemen

ranjoor
singh
had
kept
the
word
of
babu
sita
ram
and
had
managed
to
be
with
them
when
the
first
blood
ran
the
end
