here
again
boys
and
let
to
business
as
they
say
on
almost
needless
to
inform
our
readers
that
such
portion
of
a
county
as
is
hunted
by
any
one
pack
of
hounds
is
technically
denominated
their
country
and
of
all
countries
under
the
sun
that
of
the
surrey
subscription
foxhounds
undoubtedly
bears
the
bell
this
superiority
arises
from
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
soil
wretched
starvation
stuff
most
profusely
studded
with
huge
sharp
flints
the
abundance
of
large
woods
particularly
on
the
kent
side
and
the
range
of
mountainous
hills
that
run
directly
through
the
centre
which
afford
accommodation
to
the
timid
and
are
unknown
in
most
counties
and
unequalled
in
any
one
of
the
most
striking
features
in
the
aspect
of
this
chosen
region
of
is
the
quiet
easy
manner
in
which
the
sportsmen
take
the
thing
on
they
go
now
trotting
gently
over
the
flints
now
softly
ambling
along
the
grassy
ridge
of
some
stupendous
hill
now
quietly
following
each
other
in
files
like
geese
through
some
close
and
deep
ravine
or
interminable
wood
which
to
their
holloas
every
man
shouting
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
his
subscription
until
day
is
made
horrible
with
their
yelling
there
is
no
pushing
jostling
rushing
cramming
or
riding
over
one
another
no
jealousy
discord
or
daring
no
ridiculous
foolhardy
feats
but
each
man
cranes
and
rides
and
rides
and
cranes
in
a
style
that
would
gladden
the
eye
of
a
director
of
an
insurance
office
the
members
of
the
surrey
are
the
people
that
combine
business
with
pleasure
and
even
in
the
severest
run
can
find
time
for
sweet
discourse

talk

and
we
be
off
together
it
is
this
union
of
the
elegant
courtesies
and
business
of
life
with
the
energetic
sports
of
the
field
that
constitutes
the
charm
of
surrey
hunting
and
who
can
wonder
that
cits
pent
up
all
the
week
should
gladly
fly
from
their
shops
to
enjoy
a
day
sport
on
a
saturday
we
must
not
however
omit
to
express
a
hope
that
young
men
who
have
their
way
to
make
in
the
world
may
not
be
led
astray
by
its
allurements
it
is
all
very
well
for
shopkeepers
to
do
a
bit
of
pleasure
occasionally
but
the
apprentice
or
journeyman
who
understands
his
duties
and
the
tricks
of
his
trade
will
never
be
found
capering
in
the
hunting
field
he
will
feel
that
his
proper
place
is
behind
the
counter
and
while
his
master
is
away
enjoying
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
he
can
prig
as
much
pewter
from
the
till
as
will
take
both
himself
and
his
lass
to
sadler
wells
theatre
or
any
other
place
she
may
choose
to
appoint
but
to
return
to
the
surrey
the
town
of
croydon
nine
miles
from
the
standard
in
cornhill
is
the
general
rendezvous
of
the
gallant
sportsmen
it
is
the
principal
market
town
in
the
eastern
division
of
the
county
of
surrey
and
the
who
carry
the
produce
of
their
acres
to
it
instead
of
to
the
neighbouring
village
of
london
retain
much
of
their
pristine
barbarity
the
town
furnishes
an
interesting
scene
on
a
hunting
morning
particularly
on
a
saturday
at
an
early
hour
groups
of
grinning
cits
may
be
seen
pouring
in
from
the
london
side
some
on
the
top
of
cloud
coaches
some
in
taxed
carts
but
the
greater
number
mounted
on
good
nags
of
the
invaluable
species
calculated
for
sport
or
business
warranted
free
from
vice
and
quiet
both
to
ride
and
in
harness
some
few
there
are
who
with
that
kindness
and
considerate
attention
which
peculiarly
mark
this
class
of
sportsmen
have
tacked
a
buggy
to
their
hunter
and
given
a
seat
to
a
friend
who
leaning
over
the
back
of
the
gig
his
jocund
phiz
turned
towards
his
fidus
achates
leads
his
own
horse
behind
listening
to
the
discourse
of
his
ancient
or
regaling
him
with
sweet
converse
and
thus
they
onward
jog
until
the
sign
of
the
greyhound
stretching
quite
across
the
main
street
greets
their
expectant
optics
and
seems
to
forbid
their
passing
the
open
portal
below
in
they
wend
then
and
having
seen
their
horses
sorted
and
the
collar
marks
as
much
as
may
be
carefully
effaced
by
the
shrewd
application
of
a
due
quantity
of
grease
and
speed
in
to
mine
host
and
order
a
sound
repast
of
the
good
things
of
this
world
the
which
to
discuss
they
presently
apply
themselves
with
a
vigour
that
indicates
as
much
a
determination
to
recruit
fatigue
endured
as
to
lay
in
stock
against
the
effects
of
future
exertion
meanwhile
the
bustle
increases
sportsmen
arrive
by
the
score
fresh
tables
are
laid
out
covered
with
no
end
of
vivers
and
towards
the
hour
of
nine
may
be
heard
to
perfection
that
pleasing
assemblage
of
sounds
issuing
from
the
masticatory
organs
of
a
number
of
men
steadfastly
and
studiously
employed
in
the
delightful
occupation
of
preparing
their
mouthfuls

deglutition

describing
the
noiseless

of

by
the

there
is
no
crash
now

not
much

it
is
the
tinker
that
makes
a
great
noise
over
a
little
work

at
the
pace
these

no

for

so
gentle
lector
there
is
now
no
leisure
for
bandying
compliments
is
your
small
eater
alone
who
chatters
his
meals
your
sportsman
is
ever
a
silent
and
consequently
an
assiduous
grubber
true
it
is
that
occasionally
space
is
found
between
mouthfuls
to
vociferate
waiter
in
a
tone
that
requires
not
repetition
and
most
sonorously
do
the
throats
of
the
assembled
eaters
the
sound
but
this
is
all
no
useless
exuberance
of
speech
no
the
knife
or
fork
is
directed
towards
what
is
wanted
nor
needs
there
any
more
expressive
intimation
of

footnote
the
date
of
this
description
it
must
be
remembered
is
put
many
years
back
at
length
the
hour
of
ten
approaches
bills
are
paid
filled
sandwiches
stowed
away
horses
accoutred
and
our
bevy
straddle
forth
into
the
town
to
the
infinite
gratification
of
troops
of
urchins
who
for
the
last
hour
have
been
peeping
in
at
the
windows
impatiently
watching
for
the
of
our

away

over

through

up

any
slight
degree
of
pursiness
that
the
good
steeds
may
have
acquired
by
standing
at
livery
in
cripplegate
or
elsewhere
is
speedily
pumped
out
of
them
by
a
smart
brush
over
the
turf
to
the
fox
at
keston
where
a
numerous
assemblage
of
true
sportsmen
patiently
await
the
usual
hour
for
throwing
off
at
length
time
being
called
say
twenty
minutes
to
eleven
and
jorrocks
nodding
homer
and
the
principal
subscribers
having
cast
up
the
hounds
approach
the
cover
yooi

there
shouts
tom

who
has
long
hunted
this
crack
pack
and
crack
crack

go
the
whips
of
some
scores
of
sportsmen
yelp
yelp

the
hounds
and
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
tom
has
not
above
four
or
five
couple
at
his
heels
this
number
being
a
trifle
tom
runs
his
prad
at
a
gap
in
the
fence
by
the
the
old
nag
goes
well
at
it
but
stops
short
at
the
critical
moment
and
instead
of
taking
the
ditch
bolts
and
wheels
round
tom
however
who
is
large
in
the
boiling
pieces
as
they
say
at
whitechapel
is
prevented
by
his
weight
from
being
shaken
out
of
his
saddle
and
being
resolved
to
take
no
denial
he
lays
the
crop
of
his
about
the
head
of
his
beast
and
runs
him
at
the
same
spot
a
second
time
with
an
accompaniment
of
his
backed
by
a
curm
along
then
issued
in
such
a
tone
as
plainly
informs
his
quadruped
he
is
in
no
joking
humour
these
incentives
succeed
in
landing
tom
and
his
nag
in
the
spot
when
immediately
the
wood
begins
to
resound
with
shouts
of
yoicks
yoicks
yoicks
push
him
up
yoicks
wind
him
and
the
whole
pack
begin
to
work
like
good
occasionally
may
be
heard
the
howl
of
some
unfortunate
hound
that
has
been
caught
in
a
fox
trap
or
taken
in
a
hare
snare
and
not
unfrequently
the
discordant
growls
of
some
three
or
four
more
vociferously
quarrelling
over
the
venerable
remains
of
some
defunct
rabbit
oh
you
rogues
cries
jorrocks
a
cit
rapturously
fond
of
the
sport
after
the
lapse
of
half
an
hour
the
noise
in
the
wood
for
a
time
increases
audibly
is
tom
chastising
the
gourmands
another
quarter
of
an
hour
and
a
hound
that
has
finished
his
coney
bone
slips
out
of
the
wood
and
takes
a
roll
upon
the
greensward
opining
no
doubt
that
such
pastime
is
preferable
to
scratching
his
hide
among
brambles
in
the
covers
hounds
have
no
right
to
opine
opines
the
head
so
clapping
spurs
into
his
prad
he
begins
to
pursue
the
delinquent
round
the

with

markis
what
are
you
at

get

markis
but
it
no

marquis
creeps
through
a
hedge
and
grins
horribly
a
ghastly
smile
at
his
ruthless
tormentor
who
wends
back
well
pleased
at
having
had
an
excuse
for
taking
a
bit
gallop
half
an
hour
more
slips
away
and
some
of
the
least
hasty
of
our
cits
begin
to
wax
impatient
in
spite
of
the
admonition
do
be
in
a
hurry
at
length
a
yokel
pops
out
of
the
cover
and
as
soon
as
he
has
recovered
breath
informs
the
field
that
he
has
been
to
for
half
an
hour
and
that
the
fox
had
gone
away
for
tatsfield
as
soon
as
ever
the
went
into
all
is
now
girths
are
tightened
reins
gathered
up
sandwiches
thrust
into
the
mouth
applied
to
coats
comfortably
buttoned
up
to
the
throat
and
these
preparations
made
away
goes
the
whole
field
coolly
and
fairly
along
the
road
to
leaves
green
and
crown
ash
hill
from
which
latter
spot
the
operations
of
the
pack
in
the
bottom
may
be
comfortably
and
securely
viewed
leaving
the
whips
to
flog
as
many
hounds
out
of
cover
as
they
can
and
tom
to
entice
as
many
more
as
are
willing
to
follow
the
twang
twang
twang
of
his
horn
and
now
a
sufficient
number
of
hounds
having
been
seduced
from
the
wood
forth
sallies
tummas
and
making
straight
for
the
spot
where
our
yokel
mate
stands
leaning
on
his
obtains
from
him
the
exact
latitude
and
longitude
of
the
spot
where
reynard
broke
through
the
hedge
to
this
identical
place
is
the
pack
forthwith
led
and
no
sooner
have
they
reached
it
than
the
wagging
of
their
sterns
clearly
shows
how
genuine
is
their
breed
old
strumpet
at
length
first
looking
up
in
tom
face
for
applause
ventures
to
send
forth
a
howl
which
coupled
with
tom
screech
setting
the
rest
agog
away
they
all
go
like
beans
and
the
wind
fortunately
setting
towards
westerham
bears
the
melodious
sound
to
the
delighted
ears
of
our
roadsters
who
forthwith
catching
the
infection
respond
with
deafening
shouts
and
joyous
yells
set
to
every
key
and
disdaining
the
laws
of
harmony
thus
what
with
tom
horn
the
holloaing
of
the
whips
and
the
shouts
of
the
riders
a
very
pretty
notion
may
be
formed
of
what
virgil
calls
clamorque
virûm
clangorque
tubarum
a
terrible
noise
is
the
result
at
the
end
of
nine
minutes
or
so
the
hounds
come
to
fault
in
the
bottom
below
the
blacksmith
at
crown
ash
hill
and
the
fox
has
a
capital
chance
in
fact
they
have
changed
for
the
blacksmith
tom
cat
which
rushed
out
before
them
and
finding
their
mistake
return
at
their
leisure
this
gives
the
most
daring
of
the
field
on
the
eminence
an
opportunity
of
descending
to
view
the
sport
more
closely
and
being
assembled
in
the
bottom
each
congratulates
his
neighbour
on
the
excellent
condition
and
stanchness
of
the
hounds
and
the
admirable
view
that
has
been
afforded
them
of
their
peculiar
style
of
hunting
at
this
interesting
period
a
regular
swell
from
melton
mowbray
unknown
to
everyone
except
his
tailor
to
whom
he
owes

that
took

the
body
of

the
rest
of

along

is
not
afraid
of
the

so
long
as
there
is
no
leaping
has
a
pretty
good
chance
with

the
scene
now
shifts
on
turning
out
of
a
lane
along
which
they
have
just
rattled
a
fence
of
this
description
appears
the
bottom
part
is
made
of
flints
and
the
upper
part
of
mud
with
gorse
stuck
along
the
top
and
there
is
a
gutter
on
each
side
jorrocks
seeing
that
a
leap
is
likely
hangs
astern
and
swell
thinking
to
shake
off
his
only
opponent
and
to
have
a
rare
laugh
at
the
surrey
when
he
gets
back
to
melton
puts
his
nag
at
it
most
manfully
who
though
somewhat
blown
manages
to
get
his
long
carcass
over
but
unfortunately
alighting
on
a
bed
of
flints
on
the
far
side
cuts
a
back
sinew
and
swell
measures
his
length
on
the
headland

then
pulls
up
the
tragedy
of
george
barnwell
ends
with
a
death
and
we
are
happy
in
being
able
to
gratify
our
readers
with
a
similar
entertainment
already
have
the
men
in
the
field
attained
the
summit
of
one
of
the
mont
blancs
of
the
country
when
on
looking
down
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
brow
they
to
their
infinite
astonishment
espy
at
some
distance
our
swell
dismounted
and
playing
at

devil
pull
baker
with
the
hounds
whose
discordant
bickerings
rend
the
skies
cries
one
responds
another
screams
a
third
and
the
contagion
spreading
and
each
man
dismounting
they
descend
the
hill
with
due
caution
hallooing
and
congratulating
each
other
on
the
splendour
of
the
run
interspersed
with
divers
surmises
as
to
what
mighty
magic
had
aided
the
hounds
in
getting
on
such
good
terms
with
the
warmint
and
exclamations
at
the
good
fortune
of
the
stranger
in
being
able
by
nicking
and
the
fox
changing
his
line
to
get
in
at
the
finish
footnote

stranger
never
rides
straight
if

beats

now

dozens
of
sportsmen
quietly
ambling
up
to
the
scene
of
action

with
delight
alone
equalled
by
their
wonder
at
so
unusual
and
unexpected
an
event
the
quarrels
of
the
hounds
as
they
dispute
with
each
other
the
possession
of
their
victim
remains
when
suddenly
a
gentleman
clad
in
a
bright
green
with
white
leathers
and
hessian
boots
with
large
tassels
carrying
his
joe
manton
on
his
shoulder
issues
from
an
adjoining
coppice
and
commences
a
loud
complaint
of
the
unhandsome
conduct
of
the
gentlemen
in
devouring
the
hare
which
he
had
taken
so
much
pains
to
shoot
scarcely
are
these
words
out
of
his
mouth
than
the
whole
hunt
from
jorrocks
downwards
let
drive
such
a
rich
torrent
of
abuse
at
our
unfortunate
that
he
is
fain
to
betake
himself
to
his
heels
leaving
them
undisputed
masters
of
the
field
the
visages
of
our
sportsmen
become
dismally
lengthened
on
finding
that
their
fox
has
been
gathered
unto
his
fathers
by
means
of
hot
lead
and
that
villainous
saltpetre
digged
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
harmless
earth
some
few
indeed
there
are
who
are
bold
enough
to
declare
that
the
pack
has
actually
made
a
meal
of
a
hare
and
that
their
fox
is
snugly
earthed
in
the
neighbouring
cover
however
as
there
are
no
reliquias
danaum
to
prove
or
disprove
this
assertion
tom
hills
having
an
eye
to
the
ventures
to
give
it
as
his
opinion
that
pug
has
fairly
yielded
to
his
invincible
pursuers
without
having
dropped
to
shot
this
appearing
to
give
very
general
satisfaction
the
first
whip
makes
no
scruple
of
swearing
that
he
saw
the
hounds
pull
him
down
fairly
and

drawing
his
mouth
up
on
one
side
with
his
usual
intellectual
grin
takes
a
similar
affidavit
the
bromley
barber
too
anxious
to
have
it
to
say
that
he
has
for
once
been
in
at
the
death
of
a
fox
vows
by
his
beard
that
he
saw
the
varmint
lathered
in
style

these
protestations
being
received
with
clamorous
applause
and
everyone
being
pleased
to
have
so
unusual
an
event
to
record
to
his
admiring
spouse
agrees
that
a
fox
has
not
only
been
killed
but
killed
in
a
most
sportsmanlike
workmanlike
businesslike
manner
and
long
and
loud
are
the
congratulations
great
is
the
increased
importance
of
each
man
physiognomy
and
thereupon
they
all
lug
out
their
for
tom
hills
in
the
meantime
our
swell
lays
hold
of
his
nag
who
is
sorely
damaged
with
the
flints
and
whose
wind
has
been
pretty
well
pumped
out
of
him
by
the
hills
and
proceeds
to
lead
him
back
to
croydon
inwardly
promising
himself
for
the
future
most
studiously
to
avoid
the
renowned
county
of
surrey
its
woods
its
barbers
its
mountains
and
its
flints
and
to
leave
more
daring
spirits
to
overcome
the
difficulties
it
presents
most
religiously
resolving
at
the
same
time
to
return
as
speedily
as
possible
to
his
dear
leicestershire
there
to
amble
the
turf
and
fancy
himself
an
angel
on
horseback
the
story
of
the
country
mouse
who
must
needs
see
the
town
occurs
forcibly
to
his
recollection
and
he
exclaims
aloud
me
sylva
cavusque
tutus
ab
insidiis
tenui
solabitur
ervo
on
overhearing
which
jorrocks
hurries
back
to
his
brother
subscribers
and
informs
them
very
gravely
that
the
stranger
is
no
less
a
personage
than
prince
matuchevitz
the
russian
ambassador
and
minister
plenipotentiary
extraordinary
whereupon
the
whole
field
join
in
wishing
him
safe
back
in
russia
or
anywhere
else
and
wonder
at
his
incredible
assurance
in
supposing
that
he
could
cope
with
the
surrey
hunt
ii
the
yorkshireman
and
the
surrey
it
is
an

in

a
young
yorkshireman

frequently
appearing
in

pages
we
may
introduce
as
a
loosish
sort
of
hand
up
to
anything
in
the
way
of
a
lark
but
rather
deficient
in
cash
a
character
so
common
in
london
as
to
render
further
description
needless
now
it
is
well
known
that
a
yorkshireman
like
a
dragoon
is
nothing
without
his
horse
and
if
he
does
understand
anything
better
than
racing
it
is
hunting
our
readers
will
therefore
readily
conceive
that
a
yorkshireman
is
more
likely
to
be
astonished
at
the
possibility
of
from
london
than
captivated
by
the
country
or
style
of
and
in
truth
looking
at
it

dispassionately
in

drawn

a
window
which
overlooks
the
cream
of
the
grazing
grounds
in
the
vale
of

it
does
strike
us
with
astonishment
that
such
a
thing
as
a
fox
should
be
found
within
a
day
ride
of
the
suburbs
the
very
idea
seems
preposterous
for
one
can
not
but
associate
the
charms
of
a
find
with
the
horrors
of
going
to
ground
in
an
omnibus
or
the
fox
being
headed
by
a
great
eady
placard
or
some
such
monstrosity
mayne
to
be
sure
has
brought
racing
home
to
every
man
door

is
not
quite
so
tractable

sport

canvas
and
no
wonder
your
ugly
mug
frightened
them
replied
he
of
the
velvets
ay
but
that
was
in
consequence
of
my
riding
by
balance
instead
of
gripping
with
my
legs
replied
dickens
you
see
i
had
taken
seven
lessons
in
riding
at
the
school
in
bidborough
street
burton
crescent
and
they
always
told
me
to
balance
myself
equally
on
the
saddle
and
harden
my
heart
and
ride
at
whatever
came
in
the
way
and
the
tent
coming
first
why
naturally
enough
i
went
at
it
but
i
have
had
some
practice
since
then
and
of
course
can
stick
on
better
i
have
regularly
ever
since
and
can
the
trick
now
what
summer
and
winter
said
jorrocks
no
replied
he
but
i
have
regularly
every
fifth
saturday
since
the
began
after
numerous
discourses
similar
to
the
foregoing
they
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
first
stage
on
the
road
to
the
hunt
namely
the
small
town
of
croydon
the
rendezvous
of
london
sportsmen
the
whole
place
was
alive
with
red
coats
green
coats
blue
coats
black
coats
brown
coats
in
short
coats
of
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
horsemen
were
mounting
horsemen
were
dismounting
shays
and
chaises
were
discharging
their
burdens
grooms
were
buckling
on
their
masters
spurs
and
others
were
pulling
off
their
overalls
eschewing
the
greyhound
they
turn
short
to
the
right
and
make
for
the
derby
arms
hunting
stables
charley
morton
a
fine
old
boy
of
his
age
was
buckling
on
his
armour
for
the
fight
for
his
soul
too
was
on
fire
and
eager
for
the
chase
he
was
for
the
venison
and
having
mounted
his
was
speedily
joined
by
divers
perfect
swells
in
beautiful
leathers
beautiful
coats
beautiful
tops
beautiful
everything
except
horses
and
off
they
rode
to
cut
in
for
the
first
course
a
on
a
saturday
being
usually
divided
into
three
the
ride
down
had
somewhat
sharpened
jorrocks
appetite
and
feeling
as
he
said
quite
ready
for
his
dinner
he
repaired
to
house
a
kind
of
sporting
snuggery
everything
in
order
and
very
good
where
he
baited
himself
on
sausages
and
salt
herrings
a
basin
of
new
milk
with
some
sticking
powder
as
he
called
it
rum
infused
into
it
and
having
deposited
a
loaf
in
one
pocket
as
a
sort
of
balance
against
a
huge
bunch
of
keys
which
rattled
in
the
other
he
pulled
out
his
watch
and
finding
they
had
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
spare
proposed
to
chaperon
the
yorkshireman
on
a
tour
of
the
hunting
stables
jorrocks
summoned
the
ostler
and
with
great
dignity
led
the
way
humph
said
he
evidently
disappointed
at
seeing
half
the
stalls
empty
no
great
show
this
morning
pity
gentleman
come
from
a
distance
should
like
to
have
shown
him
some
good
what
sort
of
a
devil
this
oh
sir
he
a
good
and
nothing
but
a
good
leap
lord
love
ye
he
leap
anything
a
railway
cut
a
windmill
with
the
sails
going
a
navigable
river
with
ships
anything
in
short
this
is
the
wot
took
the
line
of
houses
down
at
beddington
the
day
they
had
the
tremendious
run
from
reigate
hill
and
wot
the
grey
in
the
far
stall
oh
that
pepper
old
nag
as
we
call
him
since
he
threw
the
old
gemman
the
morning
they
met
at
the
at
ashtead
but
he
good
for
nothing
bless
ye
his
tail
shakes
for
all
the
world
like
a
afore
he
gone
half
a
mile
those
be
yours
in
the
far
stalls
and
since
they
were
turned
round
i
won
a
bob
of
a
gemman
who
i
bet
i
show
him
two
with
their
heads
vere
their
tails
should
be
i
always
says
added
he
with
a
leer
that
you
rides
the
best
of
any
gemman
vot
comes
to
our
governor
this
flattered
jorrocks
and
sidling
up
he
slipped
a
shilling
into
his
hand
saying
well
bring
them
out
and
let
see
how
they
look
this
morning
the
stall
reins
are
slipped
and
out
they
step
with
their
hoods
on
their
quarters
one
was
a
large
fat
chestnut
with
a
white
ratch
down
the
full
extent
of
his
face
a
long
square
tail
bushy
mane
with
untrimmed
heels
the
other
was
a
brown
about
fifteen
two
with
a
and
the
tackle
was
the
same
as
they
came
down
with
you
do
the
trick
on
that
i
reckon
said
jorrocks
throwing
his
leg
over
the
chestnut
and
looking
askew
at
the
yorkshireman
as
he
mounted
and
old
and
tatt
before
him
all
agree
that
they
never
knew
a
bad
with
a
footnote
a
favourite
joke
among
grooms
when
a
horse
is
turned
round
in
his
stall
but
let
me
tell
you
you
must
be
werry
lively
if
you
mean
to
live
with
our
they
go
like
the
wind
but
come
touch
him
with
the
spur
and
let
do
a
trot
the
yorkshireman
obeyed
and
getting
into
the
main
street
onwards
they
jogged
right
through
croydon
and
struck
into
a
line
of
villas
of
all
sorts
shapes
and
sizes
which
extend
for
several
miles
along
the
road
exhibiting
all
sorts
of
architecture
gothic
corinthian
doric
ionic
dutch
and
chinese
these
gradually
diminished
in
number
and
at
length
they
found
themselves
on
an
open
heath
within
a
few
miles
of
the
meet
of
the
surrey
foxhounds
now
says
jorrocks
clawing
up
his
smalls
you
will
see
the
werry
finest
pack
of
hounds
in
all
england
i
do
care
where
the
next
best
are
and
you
will
see
as
good
a
as
ever
you
saw
in
your
life
and
as
nice
a
country
to
ride
over
as
ever
you
were
in
they
reach
the
meet
a
wayside
on
a
common
before
which
the
hounds
with
their
attendants
and
some
fifty
or
sixty
horsemen
many
of
them
in
scarlet
were
assembled
jorrocks
was
received
with
the
greatest
cordiality
amid
whoops
and
holloas
and
cries
of
now
twankay
now
sugar
now
figs
waving
his
hand
in
token
of
recognition
he
passed
on
and
made
straight
for
tom
hill
with
a
face
full
of
importance
and
nearly
rode
over
a
hound
in
his
hurry
now
tom
said
he
with
the
greatest
energy
do
my
good
fellow
strain
every
nerve
to
show
sport
a
gentleman
has
come
all
the
way
from
the
side
of
the
town
of
boroughbridge
in
the
county
of
york
to
see
our
excellent
and
i
would
fain
have
him
do
show
us
a
run
and
let
it
end
with
blood
so
that
he
may
have
something
to
tell
the
natives
when
he
gets
back
to
his
own
parts
that
him
see
sitting
under
the
in
a
coat
with
basket
buttons
just
striking
a
light
on
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
to
indulge
in
a
keep
your
eye
on
him
all
day
and
if
you
can
lead
him
over
an
awkward
place
and
get
him
a
purl
so
much
the
if
he
risk
his
neck
i
risk
my
the
yorkshireman
having
lighted
his
cigar
and
tightened
his
girths
rode
leisurely
among
the
horsemen
many
of
whom
were
in
eager
council
and
a
gentle
breeze
wafted
divers
scraps
of
conversation
to
his
ear

away
was
heard
and
presently
the
huntsman
with
some
of
the
pack
at
his
horse
heels
issued
from
the
wood
playing
britannia
on
a
while
the
cracks
of
whips
warned
the
stragglers
and
loiterers
to
follow
music
hath
charms
to
soothe
the
savage
beast
observed
jorrocks
as
he
tucked
the
laps
of
his
frock
over
his
thighs
and
i
hope
we
shall
find
before
long
else
that
quarter
of
will
be
utterly
ruined
oh
dear
they
are
going
below
hill
i
do
believe
why
we
shall
never
get
home
and
i
told
jorrocks
five
to
a
minute
and
i
invited
old
fleecy
who
is
a
most
punctual
man
jorrocks
was
right
in
his
surmise
they
arrived
on
the
summit
of
a
range
of
steep
hills
commanding
an
extensive
view
over
the
neighbouring
country
almost
he
said
as
far
as
the
the
huntsman
and
hounds
went
down
but
many
of
the
field
held
a
council
of
war
on
the
top
well
who
going
down
said
one
i
shall
wait
for
the
next
turn
said
jorrocks
for
my
horse
does
not
like
collar
work
i
shall
go
this
time
said
another
and
the
rest
next
and
so
will
i
said
a
third
for
mayhap
there
will
be
no
second
turn
ay
added
a
fourth
and
he
may
go
the
other
way
and
then
we
all
be
poh
said
jorrocks
did
you
ever
know
a
surrey
fox
not
take
to
the
hills
if
he
does
not
i
eat
him
without
mint
sauce
again
harping
on
the
quarter
of
lamb
facilis
descensus
averni
of
the
field
went
down
leaving
jorrocks
two
in
scarlet
three
half
a
dozen
swells
in
leathers
a
whip
and
the
yorkshireman
on
the
summit
why
do
you
go
with
the
hounds
inquired
the
latter
of
the
whip
oh
i
wait
here
sir
said
he
to
meet
tom
hills
as
he
comes
up
and
to
give
him
a
fresh
horse
and
who
is
tom
hills
inquired
the
yorkshireman
oh
he
our
huntsman
replied
he
you
know
tom
do
you
why
i
ca
say
i
do
exactly
said
he
but
tell
me
is
he
called
hills
because
he
rides
up
and
down
these
hills
or
is
that
his
real
name
hought
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
said
he
quite
indignantly
that
tom
hills
is
his
name
the
hounds
with
the
majority
of
the
field
having
effected
the
descent
of
the
hills
were
now
trotting
on
in
the
valley
below
sufficiently
near
however
to
allow
our
hill
party
full
view
of
their
proceedings
after
drawing
a
couple
of
blank
they
assumed
a
line
parallel
to
the
hills
and
moved
on
to
a
wood
of
about
ten
acres
the
west
end
of
which
terminated
in
a
natural
gorse
they
find
there
to
a
certainty
said
jorrocks
pulling
a
telescope
out
of
his
pocket
and
adjusting
the
sight
never
saw
it
blank
but
once
and
that
was
the
werry
day
the
commercial
panic
of
i
remember
making
an
entry
in
my
ledger
when
i
got
home
to
that
effect
humph
continued
he
looking
through
the
glass
they
are
through
the
wood
though
without
a
now
my
booys
push
him
out
of
the
gorse
let
see
vot
you
made
there

bag
of
shot

all
together
my
beauties
oh
vot
a
sight
peckham
cap
in
the
air
and
it
a
find
by
heavens
jorrocks
is
the
southerly
wind
wafts
up
the
fading
notes
of
the
huntsman
chorus
in
and
confirms
the
jorrocks
is
in
now
said
he
clawing
up
his
breeches
for
he
dispenses
with
the
article
of
braces
when
out
hunting
that
what
i
calls
fine
oh
beautiful
beautiful
now
follow
me
if
you
please
and
if
yon
gentleman
in
drab
does
not
shoot
the
fox
he
will
be
on
the
hills
before
long
away
they
scampered
along
the
top
of
the
ridge
with
a
complete
view
of
the
operations
below
at
length
jorrocks
stopped
and
pulling
the
telescope
out
began
making
an
observation
there
he
is
at
last
cried
he
just
crossed
the
corner
of
yon
green
field
now
he
creeps
through
the
hedge
by
the
and
is
in
the
fallow
one
yet
stay
that
no
fox
it
a
hare
and
yet
tom
hills
makes
straight
for
the
spot
and
did
you
hear
that
loud
oh
gentlemen
gentlemen
we
shall
be
laughed
to
scorn
what
can
they
be
doing
see
they
take
up
the
scent
and
the
whole
pack
have
joined
in
chorus
great
heavens
it
no
more
a
fox
than
i
am
no
more
brush
than
a
badger
oh
dear
oh
dear
that
i
should
live
to
see
my
old
friends
the
surrey
hare
and
that
too
in
the
presence
of
a
stranger
the
animal
made
direct
for
the
hills
whatever
it
was
the
hounds
were
on
good
terms
with
it
and
got
away
in
good
form
the
sight
was
splendid
all
the
field
got
well
off
nor
between
the
cover
and
the
hills
was
there
sufficient
space
for
tailing
a
little
elderly
gentleman
in
a
coat
led
the
way
gallantly
then
came
the
scarlets
then
the
darks
and
then
the
countrymen
jorrocks
was
in
a
shocking
state
and
rolled
along
the
almost
frantic
the
field
reached
the
bottom
and
the
foremost
commenced
the
steep
ascent
oh
tom
hills
tom
hills
are
you
at
what
are
you
after
demanded
jorrocks
as
he
landed
on
the
top
here
a
gentleman

tom
laughing
he
a

but
he
so
tarnation
frightened
of
our
hounds
that
his
brush
dropped
off
through
very
fear
as
soon
as
ever
he
heard
us
go
into
the
wood
if

go

and
away
he
went
caught
the
old
dismounted
him
in
a
twinkling
and
was
on
a
fresh
horse
with
his
hounds
in
full
cry
the
line
of
flight
was
still
along
the
and
all
eagerly
pressed
on
making
a
goodly
rattle
over
the
beds
of
flints
a
check
ensued
the
guard
on
yonder
nasty
brighton
coach
has
frightened
him
with
his
horn
said
tom
now
we
must
make
a
cast
up
to
yonder
garden
and
see

as
he
stole
past

corner
out
of
the
bed
now
bring
on
the
hounds
and
let
us
press
him
towards
london
see
the
conquering
hero
comes
sounded
through
the
avenue
of
elms
as
tom
dashed
forward
with
the
merry
merry
pack
i
shall
stay
on
the
hills
said
one
and
be
ready
for
him
as
he
comes
back
i
took
a
good
deal
of
the
shine
out
of
my
horse
in
coming
up
this
time
i
think
i
will
do
the
same
said
two
or
three
more
let
be
doing
said
jorrocks
ramming
his
spurs
into
his
nag
to
seduce
him
into
a
gallop
who
after
sending
his
heels
in
the
air
a
few
times
in
token
of
his
disapprobation
of
such
treatment
at
last
put
himself
into
a
sort
of
canter
which
jorrocks
kept
up
by
dint
of
spurring
and
dropping
his
great
bastinaderer
of
a
whip
every
now
and
then
across
his
shoulders
away
they
go
pounding
together
the
line
lies
over
flint
fallows
occasionally
diversified
with
a
or
and
every
now
and
then
a
willa
appears
from
which
emerge
footmen
in
jackets
and
in
yellow
red
and
green
plush
breeches
with
no
end
of
admiring
housemaids
governesses
and
nurses
with
children
in
their
arms
great
was
the
emulation
when
any
of
these
were
approached
and
the
rasping
sportsmen
rushed
eagerly
to
the
fore
at
last
they
approach

and
polishing
seminary
for
young
ladies
whose
great
flaring
sign
reflecting
the
noonday
rays
of
the
sun
had
frightened
the
fox
and
caused
him
to
alter
his
line
and
take
away
to
the
west
a
momentary
check
ensued
but
all
the
amateur
huntsmen
being
blown
tom
who
is
well
up
with
his
hounds
makes
a
quick
cast
round
the
house
and
hits
off
the
scent
like
a
workman
a
private
road
and
a
line
of
gates
through
fields
now
greet
the
eyes
of
our
a
young
gentleman
on
a
hired
hunter
very
nattily
attired
here
singles
himself
out
and
takes
place
next
to
tom
throwing
the
pebbles
and
dirt
back
in
the
eyes
of
the
field
tom
crams
away
throwing
the
gates
open
as
he
goes
and
our
young
gentleman
very
coolly
passes
through
without
a
touch
letting
them
behind
him
the
yorkshireman
who
had
been
gradually
creeping
up
until
he
has
got
the
third
place
having
opened
two
or
three
and
seeing
another
likely
to
close
for
want
of
a
push
cries
out
to
our
friend
as
he
approaches
put
out
your
hand
sir
the
gentleman
obediently
extends
his
limb
like
the
arm
of
a
telegraph
and
rides
over
half

next

with
his
hand
in

at

turns
short
and
backing

at

espies
a

yards
from

jumping
off
prepares
to

the
farmer
has
placed
a

on
the

side
just
as
jorrocks
has
pulled

who
is
a
bit
of
a

and
has
got
his
monkey
completely
up

forward

upon

there
is

among

as
ever
those
that
are

are
out

they

there

and
forgetting

tackled
with

a

and
the

well
knew
the

was
sinking
and
was
determined
to
be
in
at
the
death
short
running
ensued
a
check
the
fox
had
lain
down
and
they
had
overrun

they
were
on
him

said
jorrocks
looking
at
his
watch
good
afternoon
gentlemen
good
afternoon
muttering
as
he
went
a
quarter
of
at
five
jorrocks
werry
punctual
old
fleecy
werry
particular
they
cut
across
country
to
croydon
and
as
they
approached
the
town
innumerable
sportsmen
came
flocking
in
from
all
quarters
what
sport
have
you
had
inquired
jorrocks
of
a
gentleman
in
scarlet
have
you
been
with
jolliffe
no
with
the
staghounds
three
beautiful
runs
took
him
once
in
a
millpond
once
in
a
barn
and
once
in
a
brickfield
altogether
the
finest
day
sport
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
what
have
you
done
mr
j
oh
we
have
had
a
most
gallant
thing
a
brilliant
run
indeed
three
hours
and
twenty
minutes
without
a
check
over
the
finest
country
imaginable
and
who
got
the
brush
inquired
the
oh
it
was
a
gallant
run
said
jorrocks
by
far
the
finest
i
ever
remember
but
did
you
kill
demanded
his
friend
kill
to
be
sure
we
did
when
do
the
surrey
kill
i
should
like
to
know
and
who
got
his
brush
did
you
say
i
ca
tell
said
he
did
hear
the
gentleman
name
what
sport
has
mr
meager
had
inquired
he
of
a
gentleman
in
trousers
who
issued
from
a
side
lane
into
the
high
road
i
have
been
with
the
sanderstead
sir
a
very
capital
day
sport
run
five
hares
and
killed
three
we
should
have
killed
four
only
we
did
i
do
think
mr
meager
has
done
anything
yes
he
has
said
a
gentleman
who
just
joined
with
a
hare
buckled
on
in
front
of
his
saddle
and
his
white
cords
all
stained
with
blood
we
killed
this
chap
after
an
hour
and
minutes
gallop
and
accounted
for
another
by
losing
her
after
running
upwards
of
an
hour
well
then
we
have
all
had
sport
said
jorrocks
as
he
spurred
his
horse
into
a
trot
and
made
for
morton
stables
and
if
the
quarter
of
is
but
right
then
indeed
am
i
a
happy
man
iii
surrey
shooting
jorrocks
in
trouble
our
readers
are
now
becoming
pretty
familiar
with
our
principal
hero
jorrocks
and
we
hope
he
improves
on
acquaintance
our
friends
we
are
sure
will
allow
him
to
be
an
enthusiastic
member
of
the
brotherhood
and
though
we
do
not
profess
to
put
him
in
competition
with
musters
osbaldeston
or
any
of
those
sort
of
men
we
yet
mean
to
say
that
had
his
lot
been
cast
in
the
country
instead
of
behind
a
counter
his
keenness
would
have
rendered
him
as
conspicuous
if
not
as
scientific
as
the
best
of
them
for
a
cockney
sportsman
however
he
is
a
very
excellent
fellow
frank
hearty
open
generous
and
hospitable
and
with
the
exception
of
riding
up
fleet
street
one
saturday
afternoon
with
a
tail
sticking
out
of
his
red
coat
pocket
no
one
ever
saw
him
do
a
cock
tail
action
in
his
life
the
circumstances
attending
that
exhibition
are
rather
he
had
gone
out
as
usual
on
a
saturday
to
have
a
day
with
the
surrey
but
on
mounting
his
hunter
at
croydon
he
felt
the
nag
rather
queer
under
him
and
thinking
he
might
have
been
pricked
in
the
shoeing
he
pulled
up
at
the
smith
at
addington
to
have
his
feet
examined
this
lost
him
five
minutes
and
unfortunately
when
he
got
to
the
meet
he
found
that
a
travelling
fox
had
been
tallied
at
the
precise
moment
of
throwing
off
with
which
the
hounds
had
gone
away
in
their
usual
brilliant
style
to
the
tune
of
blue
bonnets
are
over
the
border
as
may
be
supposed
he
was
in
a
deuce
of
a
rage
and
his
first
impulse
prompted
him
to
withdraw
his
subscription
and
be
done
with
the
hunt
altogether
and
he
trotted
forward
on
the
line
in
the
hopes
of
catching
them
up
to
tell
them
so
in
this
he
was
foiled
for
after
riding
some
distance
he
overtook
a
string
of
smithfield
horses
journeying
foreign
for
evans
whose
imprints
he
had
been
taking
for
the
of
the
hunters
about
noon
he
found
himself
dull
melancholy
and
disconsolate
before
the
sign
of
the
pig
and
whistle
on
the
westerham
road
where
after
wetting
his
own
whistle
with
a
pint
of
he
again
journeyed
onward
ruminating
on
the
uncertainty
and
mutability
of
all
earthly
affairs
the
comparative
merits
of
and
and
the
necessity
of
getting
rid
of
the
day
somehow
or
other
in
the
country
footnote
he
might
well
be
called
a
travelling
fox
for
it
was
said
he
had
just
travelled
down
from
herring
in
the
new
road
by
the
bromley
stage
suddenly
his
reverie
was
interrupted
by
the
discharge
of
a
gun
in
the
field
adjoining
the
hedge
along
which
he
was
passing
and
the
boisterous
whirring
of
a
great
over
his
head
which
caused
his
horse
to
start
and
stop
short
and
to
nearly
pitch
jorrocks
over
his
head
the
bird
was
missed
but
the
sportsman
dog
dashed
after
it
with
all
the
eagerness
of
expectation
regardless
of
the
cracks
of
the
whip
the
comes
to
heel
and
downs
to
charge
of
the
master
jorrocks
pulled
out
his
hunting
telescope
and
having
marked
the
bird
down
with
the
precision
of
a
keeper
rode
to
the
gate
to
acquaint
the
shooter
with
the
fact
when
to
his
infinite
amazement
he
discovered
his
friend
nosey
browne
late
of
the
surrey
who
since
his
affairs
had
taken
the
unfortunate
turn
mentioned
in
the
last
paper
had
given
up
hunting
and
determined
to
confine
himself
to
shooting
only
nosey
however
was
no
great
performer
as
may
be
inferred
when
we
state
that
he
had
been
in
pursuit
of
the
ever
since
daybreak
and
after
firing
thirteen
shots
at
him
had
not
yet
touched
a
feather
his
dog
was
of
the
right
sort
for
nosey
at
least
and
hope
deferred
had
not
made
his
heart
sick
on
the
contrary
he
dashed
after
his
bird
for
the
thirteenth
time
with
all
the
eagerness
he
displayed
on
the
first
let
me
have
a
crack
at
him
said
jorrocks
to
nosey
after
their
mutual
salutations
were
over
i
know
where
he
is
and
i
think
i
can
floor
him
browne
handed
the
gun
to
jorrocks
who
giving
up
his
hunter
in
exchange
strode
off
and
having
marked
his
bird
accurately
he
kicked
him
up
out
of
a
bit
of
furze
and
knocked
him
down
as
dead
as
a
by
that
pheasant
tail
hangs
the
present
one
now
nosey
browne
and
jorrocks
were
old
friends
and
nosey
affairs
having
gone
crooked
why
of
course
like
most
men
in
a
similar
situation
he
was
all
the
better
for
it
and
while
his
creditors
were
taking
in
the
pound
he
was
taking
his
diversion
on
his
wife
property
which
a
sagacious
old
had
secured
to
the
family
in
the
event
of
such
a
contingency
as
a
failure
happening
so
knowing
jorrock
propensity
for
sports
and
being
desirous
of
chatting
over
all
his
gallant
doings
with
the
surrey
shortly
after
the
day
he
dispatched
a
twopenny
offering
him
a
shooting
on
his
property
in
surrey
adding
that
he
hoped
he
would
dine
with
him
after
jorrocks
being
invited
himself
with
a
freedom
peculiar
to
invited
his
friend
the
yorkshireman
and
visiting
his
armoury
selected
him
a
regular
of
a
gun
capable
of
carrying
ten
yards
on
every
side
at
the
appointed
hour
on
the
appointed
morning
the
yorkshireman
appeared
in
great
coram
street
where
he
found
jorrocks
in
the
parlour
in
the
act
of
settling
himself
into
a
new
spruce
green
gambroon
butler
with
pockets
equal
to
holding
a
each
his
lower
man
being
attired
in
tight
drab
pantaloons
and
hessian
boots
with
large
tassels
a
striking
contrast
to
the
fustian
jackets
marked
with
strap
and
and
the
breeches
and
gaiters
and
shoes
that
compose
the
equipment
of
a
shooter
in
yorkshire
jorrocks
not
keeping
any
sporting
dogs
as
the
call
them
had
borrowed
a
fat
a
cross
between
a
setter
and
a
dalmatian
of
his
friend
evergreen
the
greengrocer
which
he
had
seen
make
a
most
undeniable
point
one
morning
in
the
copenhagen
fields
at
a
flock
of
pigeons
in
a
beetroot
garden
this
valuable
animal
was
now
attached
by
a
through
a
ring
in
his
brass
collar
to
a
leg
of
the
sideboard
while
a
clean
licked
dish
at
his
side
showed
that
jorrocks
had
been
trying
to
attach
him
to
himself
by
feeding
him
before
starting
we
take
a
coach
to
the
castle
said
jorrocks
and
then
get
a
or
a
cast
somehow
or
other
to
streatham
for
we
shall
have
walking
enough
when
we
get
there
browne
is
an
excellent
fellow
and
will
make
us
range
every
acre
of
his
estate
over
half
a
dozen
times
before
we
give
in
a
coach
was
speedily
summoned
into
which
jorrocks
the
dog
pompey
the
yorkshireman
and
the
guns
were
speedily
placed
and
away
they
drove
to
the
elephant
and
castle
there
were
short
stages
about
for
every
possible
place
except
streatham
greenwich
deptford
blackheath
eltham
bromley
footscray
beckenham
lewisham
all
places
but
the
right
however
there
were
abundance
of
a
species
of
vehicle
that
ply
in
the
outskirts
of
the
metropolis
and
which
like
the
fly
take
their
name
from
the
contrary
in
fact
a
sort
of
a
non
they
are
carts
on
springs
drawn
by
one
horse
with
curtains
to
protect
the
company
from

partly
by
cheating
and
partly
by
picking
pockets
eke
out
a
comfortable
existence
and

the
most
lawless
set
of
rascals
under
the
sun
their
arrival
at
the
elephant
and
castle
was
a
signal
for
a
general
muster
of
the
fraternity
who
seeing
the
guns
were
convinced
that
their
journey
was
only
what
they
call
a
few
miles
down
the
road
and
they
were
speedily
surrounded
by
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
all
with
excellent

their
honours
fourteen
miles
an
hour
all
men
of
business
are
aware
of
the
advantages
of
competition
and
no
one
more
so
than
jorrocks
who
stood
listening
to
their
offers
with
the
utmost
until
he
closed
with
one
to
take
them
to
streatham
church
for
two
shillings
and
deliver
them
within
the
which
was
a
signal
for
all
the
rest
to
and
abuse
them
their
coachman
and
his
horse
which
they
swore
had
been
carrying
all
night
and
could
not
go
not
none
at
all
nor
were
they
far
wrong
for
the

scrambling

hundred
yards

relaxed

he
crammed
in

most
lustily
that

would
fine

at
every
fresh
assurance
the
driver
offered
a
a
seat
but
having
enlisted
major
ballenger
into
their
cause
they
at
length
made
a
stand
which
unfortunately
for
them
was
more
than
the
horse
could
do
for
just
as

was

clean
over

into
a
dry
ditch

was
a
signal
to
quit

extricated
themselves

ballenger
looked
rather
queer
when
he
heard
they
were
going
to
nosey
browne
for
it
so
happened
that
nosey
had
managed
to
walk
into
his
books
for
groceries
and
to
the
tune
of
fourteen
pounds
a
large
sum
to
a
man
in
a
small
way
of
business
and
to
be
entertaining
friends
so
soon
after
his
composition
seemed
curious
to
uninitiated
suburban
mind
crossing
streatham
common
a
short
turn
to
the
left
by
some
leads
by
a
near
cut
across
the
fields
to
browne
house
a
brick
castellated
cottage
standing
on
the
slope
of
a
gentle
eminence
and
combining
almost
every
absurdity
a
cockney
imagination
can
be
capable
of
nosey
who
was
his
own
nash
set
out
with
the
intention
of
making
it
a
castle
and
nothing
but
a
castle
and
accordingly
the
windows
were
made
in
the
loophole
fashion
and
the
door
occupied
a
third
of
the
whole
frontage
the
inconveniences
of
the
arrangements
were
soon
felt
for
while
the
light
was
almost
excluded
from
the
rooms
rude
boreas
had
the
complete
run
of
the
castle
whenever
the
door
was
opened
to
remedy
this
nosey
increased
the
one
and
curtailed
the
other
and
the
gothic
windows
and
door
flew
from
their
positions
to
make
way
for
modern
in
rich
casements
and
a
door
of
similar
hue
the
battlements
however
remained
and
two
wooden
guns
guarded
a
brace
of
and
commanded
the
wings
of
the
castle
one
whereof
was
formed
into
a
the
other
into
a
the
peals
of
a
bright
bell
at
a
surmounted
by
a
with
the
top
cut
into
the
shape
of
a
fox
announced
their
arrival
to
the
inhabitants
of
rosalinda
castle
and
on
entering
they
discovered
young
nosey
in
the
act
of
bobbing
for
goldfish
in
a
pond
about
the
size
of
a
while
nosey
senior
a
fat
fellow
with
a
large
corporation
and
a
bottle
nose
attired
in
a
green
cloth
coat
buff
waistcoat
with
drab
shorts
and
continuations
was
reposing
tegmine
in
a
sort
of
arbour
overlooking
a
waiting
their
arrival
to
commence
an
attack
upon
the
sparrows
which
were
regaling
thereon
at
one
end
of
the
garden
was
a
sort
of
temple
composed
of
containing
a
couple
of
with
which
nosey
had
intended
making
his
fortune
by
the
early
information
to
be
acquired
by
them
but
there
is
many
a
slip
as
jorrocks
would
say
greetings
being
over
and
jorrocks
having
paid
a
visit
to
the
larder
and
made
up
a
stock
of
provisions
equal
to
a
journey
through
the
wilderness
they
adjourned
to
the
yard
to
get
the
other
dog
and
the
man
to
carry
the
game
or
rather
the
prog
for
the
former
was
but
problematical
he
was
a
character
a
sort
of
chap
of
all
work
one
in
short
who
has
no
objection
to
make
himself
generally
useful
but
if
his
genius
had
any
decided
bent
it
was
perhaps
an
inclination
towards
sporting
having
to
act
the
part
of
groom
and
gamekeeper
during
the
morning
and
butler
and
footman
in
the
afternoon
he
was
attired
in
a
sort
of
composition
dress
savouring
of
the
different
characters
performed
he
had
on
an
old
white
hat
a
groom
fustian
cut
down
into
a
with
a
whistle
at
the
red
plush
smalls
and
there
is
nothing
a
cockney
delights
in
more
than
aping
a
country
gentleman
and
browne
fancied
himself
no
bad
hand
at
it
indeed
since
his
london
occupation
was
gone
he
looked
upon
himself
as
a
country
gentleman
in
fact

joe
said
he
striddling
and
sticking
his
thumbs
into
the
of
his
waistcoat
to
this
invaluable
man
of
all
work
we
must
show
the
gemmem
some
sport
vich
do
you
think
the
best
line
to
start
upon
shall
we
go
to
the
ten
hacre
field
or
the
plantation

thompson
stubble
or
timms

said
joe
there
that

as
we
calls
drab

vot
has
haunted
the
plantin
these
two
seasons
and
none
of
us
ever
could
hit

i
hears
that
jack

tom
and
bob
are
still
left
out
of
thompson
covey
but
my
eyes
vild
vot
only
three
left
where
is
old
tom
and
the
old
ramping
hen
inquired
browne
oh
smith
and
a
party
of
them
bankside
chaps
com
down
last
saturday
gone
a
week
and
rattled
shots
at
the
covey
and
got
the
two
old
at
least
it
supposed
they
were
both
killed
though
the
seven
on
only
bagged
one
bird
but
i
heard
they
got
a
goose
or
two
as
they
vent
home
they
had
a
shot
at
old
tom
the
hare
too
but
he
is
still
alive
at
least
i
pricked
him
yesterday
morn
across
the
path
into
the
suppose
we
goes
at
him
first
the
estate
like
the
game
was
rather
deficient
in
quantity
but
browne
was
a
wise
man
and
made
the
most
of
what
he
had
and
when
he
used
to
talk
about
his
manor
on
people
thought
he
had
at
least
a
thousand
acres
the
extent
a
cockney
generally
advertises
for
when
he
wants
to
take
a
the
following
is
a
sketch
of
what
he
had
the
east
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
was
bounded
by
norwood
a
name
dear
to
cockneys
and
the
scene
of
many
a
furtive
kiss
the
hereditaments
and
premises
belonging
to
isaac
cheatum
esq
ran
parallel
with
it
on
the
west
containing
acres
be
the
same
more
or
less
separated
from
which
by
a
small
brook
or
runner
of
water
came
the
estate
of
timms
consisting
of
sixty
acres
three
roods
and
perches
commonly
called
or
known
by
the
name
of
fordham
next
to
it
were
two
allotments
in
right
of
common
for
all
manner
of
cattle
except
cows
upon
streatham
common
from
whence
up
to
rosalinda
castle
on
the
west
lay
the
estate
of
browne
consisting
of
fifty
acres
and
two
perches
now
it
so
happened
that
browne
had
formerly
the
permission
to
sport
all
the
way
up
to
norwood
a
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
and
consequently
he
might
have
been
said
to
have
the
right
of
shooting
in
norwood
itself
for
the
keepers
only
direct
their
attention
to
the
preservation
of
the
timber
and
the
morals
of
the
visitors
but
since
his
composition
with
his
creditors
cheatum
who
had
gone
to
the
wall
himself
in
former
years
was
so
scandalised
at
browne
doing
the
same
that
no
sooner
did
his
name
appear
in
the
than
cheatum
withdrew
his
permission
thereby
cutting
him
off
from
norwood
and
stopping
him
in
pursuit
of
his
game
joe
proposition
being
duly
seconded
jorrocks
in
the
most
orthodox
manner
flushed
off
his
old
flint
and
steel
and
proceeded
to
give
it
an
uncommon
good
loading
the
yorkshireman
with
a
look
of
disgust
mingled
with
despair
and
a
glance
at
joe
plush
breeches
and
did
the
same
while
nosey
in
the
most
considerate
sportsmanlike
manner
merely
shouldered
a
stick
in
order
that
there
might
be
no
delicacy
with
his
visitors
as
to
who
should
shoot
first
a
piece
of
etiquette
that
aids
the
escape
of
many
a
bird
in
the
neighbourhood
of
london
old
tom
a
most
unfortunate
old
hare
that
what
with
the
harriers
the
shooters
the
snarers
and
one
thing
and
another
never
knew
a
peace
and
who
must
have
started
in
the
world
with
as
many
lives
as
a
cat
being
doomed
to
receive
the
first
crack
on
this
occasion
our
sportsmen
stole
gently
down
the
fallow
at
the
bottom
of
which
were
the
turnips
wherein
he
was
said
to
repose
but
scarcely
had
they
reached
the
hurdles
which
divided
the
field
before
he
was
seen
legging
it
away
clean
out
of
shot
jorrocks
who
had
brought
his
gun
to
bear
upon
him
could
scarcely
refrain
from
letting
drive
but
thinking
to
come
upon
him
again
by
stealth
as
he
made
his
circuit
for
norwood
he
strode
away
across
the
allotments
and
fordham
estate
and
took
up
a
position
behind
a
shed
which
stood
on
the
confines
of
timms
and
properties
here
having
procured
a
rest
for
his
gun
he
waited
until
old
tom
who
had
tarried
to
nip
a
few
blades
of
green
grass
that
came
in
his
way
made
his
appearance
presently
he
came
cantering
along
the
outside
of
the
wood
at
a
careless
easy
sort
of
pace
betokening
either
perfect
indifference
for
the
world
mischief
or
utter
contempt
of
cockney
sportsmen
altogether
he
was
a
melancholy
animal
long
and
lean
with
a
slight
inclination
to
grey
on
his
dingy
old
coat
one
that
looked
as
though
he
had
survived
his
kindred
and
had
already
lived
beyond
his
day
jorrocks
however
saw
him
differently
and
his
eyes
glistened
as
he
came
within
range
of
his
gun
a
shot
ends
poor
miseries
he
springs
into
the
air
and
with
a
melancholy
scream
rolls
neck
over
heels
knowing
that
pompey
would
infallibly
spoil
him
if
he
got
up
first
jorrocks
without
waiting
to
load
was
in
the
act
of
starting
off
to
pick
him
up
when
at
the
first
step
he
found
himself
in
the
grasp
of
a
herculean
monster
something
between
a
and
a
gamekeeper
who
had
been
secreted
behind
the
shed
nosey
browne
who
had
been
watching
his
movements
holloaed
out
to
jorrocks
to
hold
hard
who
stood
motionless
on
the
spot
from
whence
he
fired
and
browne
was
speedily
alongside
of
him
you
are
on
squire
estate
said
the
man
and
i
have
authority
to
take
up
all
poachers
and
persons
found
unlawfully
trespassing
what
your
name
he
not
on
cheatum
estate
said
browne
he
is
said
the
man
you
a
liar
said
browne
you
another
said
the
man
and
so
they
went
on
for
when
such
gentlemen
meet

the
keeper
pulled
out
a
and
keeping
jorrocks
in
the
same
position
he
caught
him
he
to
measure
the
distance
of
his
foot
from
the
boundary
taking
off
in
a
line
from
the
shed
when
it
certainly
did
appear
that
the
length
of
a
big
toe
was
across
the
mark
and
putting
up
his
measure
again
he
insisted
upon
taking
jorrocks
before
a
magistrate
for
the
trespass
of
course
no
objection
could
be
made
and
they
all
adjourned
to
boreem
when
the
whole
case
was
laid
before
him
to
cut
a
long
matter
short
after
hearing
the
pros
and
cons
and
referring
to
the
act
of
parliament
his
worship
decided
that
a
trespass
had
been
committed
and
though
he
said
it
went
against
the
grain
to
do
so
he
fined
jorrocks
in
the
mitigated
penalty
of
one
pound
one
this
was
a
sad
damper
to
our
heroes
who
returned
to
the
castle
with
their
prog
untouched
and
no
great
appetite
for
dinner
being
only
a
family
party
when
b
retired
the
subject
naturally
turned
upon
the
morning
mishap
and
at
every
glass
of
port
jorrocks
waxed
more
valiant
until
he
swore
he
would
appeal
against
the
conwiction
and
remaining
in
the
same
mind
when
he
awoke
the
next
morning
he
took
the
temple
in
his
way
to
botolph
lane
and
had
worth
with
capias
the
attorney
who
very
judiciously
argued
each
side
of
the
question
without
venturing
an
opinion
and
proposed
stating
a
case
for
counsel
to
advise
upon
as
usual
he
gave
one
that
would
cut
either
way
though
if
it
had
any
tendency
whatever
it
was
to
induce
jorrocks
to
go
on
and
he
not
wanting
much
persuasion
it
will
not
surprise
our
readers
to
hear
that
jorrocks
capias
and
the
yorkshireman
were
seen
a
few
days
after
crossing
waterloo
bridge
in
a
yellow
on
their
way
to
croydon
sessions
after
a
guinea
consultation
at
the
greyhound
they
adjourned
to
the
court
which
was
excessively
crowded
jorrocks
being
as
popular
with
the
farmers
and
people
as
cheatum
was
the
reverse
party
feeling
too
running
rather
high
at
the
time
there
had
been
a
strong
whip
among
the
magistrates
to
get
a
full
attendance
to
reverse
boreem
conviction
who
had
made
himself
rather
obnoxious
on
the
blue
interest
at
the
election
of
course
they
all
came
in
new
hats
and
sat
on
the
bench
looking
as
wise
as
gentlemen
judges
generally
do
footnote
magistrates
always
buy
their
hats
about
session
times
as
they
have
the
privilege
of
keeping
their
hats
on
their
blocks
in
court
one
hundred
and
affiliation
cases
for
this
was
in
the
old
poor
law
time
having
been
disposed
of
about
one
in
the
afternoon
the
chairman
tomkins
of
tomkins
moved
the
order
of
the
day
he
was
a
perfect
prototype
of
a
county
magistrate
with
a
bald
powdered
head
covered
by
a
hat
hair
terminating
behind
in
a
resting
on
the
ample
collar
of
a
coat
with
a
large
of
a
corporation
with
difficulty
retained
by
the
joint
efforts
of
a
buff
waistcoat
and
the
waistband
of
a
pair
of
yellow
leather
breeches
his
countenance
which
was
solemn
and
grave
in
the
extreme
might
either
be
indicative
of
sense
or
what
often
serves
in
the
place
of
wisdom
when
parties
can
only
hold
their
tongues
great
natural
stupidity
from
the
judge
seat
which
he
occupied
in
the
centre
of
the
bench
he
observed
with
immense
dignity
there
is
an
appeal
of
jorrocks
against
cheatum
which
we
the
bench
of
magistrates
of
our
lord
the
king
will
take
if
the
parties
are
ready
and
immediately
the
court
rang
with
jorrocks
and
cheatum
jorrocks
and
cheatum
capias
capias
answer
to
his
name
sharp
sharp
in
the
then
go
fetch
him
directly
from
the
ushers
and
bailiffs
of
the
court
for
though
tomkins
of
tomkins
was
slow
himself
he
insisted
upon
others
being
quick
and
was
a
great
hand
at
prating
about
saving
the
time
of
the
suitors
at
length
the
bustle
of
counsel
crossing
the
table
parties
coming
in
and
others
leaving
court
bailiffs
shouting
and
ushers
responding
gradually
subsided
into
a
whisper
of
that
jorrocks
that
cheatum
as
the
belligerent
parties
took
their
places
by
their
respective
counsel
silence
having
been
called
and
procured
smirk
a
man
for
a
lawyer
having
deliberately
unfolded
his
brief
which
his
clerk
had
scored
plentifully
in
the
margin
to
make
the
attorney
believe
he
had
read
it
very
attentively
rose
to
address
the
court
a
signal
for
half
the
magistrates
to
pull
their
newspapers
out
of
their
pockets
and
the
other
half
to
settle
themselves
down
for
a
nap
all
the
sport
being
considered
over
when
the
affiliation
cases
closed
i
have
the
honour
to
appear
on
behalf
of
jorrocks
said
smirk
a
gentleman
of
the
very
highest
consideration
a
a
shooter
and
a
grocer
in
ordinary
cases
it
might
be
necessary
to
prove
the
party
claim
to
respectability
but
in
this
instance
i
feel
myself
relieved
from
any
such
obligation
knowing
as
i
do
that
there
is
no
one
in
this
court
no
one
in
these
realms
i
might
almost
add
no
one
in
this
world
to
whom
the
fame
of
my
most
respectable
my
most
distinguished
and
much
injured
client
is
unknown
not
to
know
jorrocks
is
indeed
to
argue
oneself
unknown
this
is
a
case
of
no
ordinary
interest
and
i
approach
it
with
a
deep
sense
of
its
importance
conscious
of
my
inability
to
do
justice
to
the
subject
and
lamenting
that
it
has
not
been
entrusted
to
abler
hands
it
is
a
case
involving
the
commercial
and
the
sporting
character
of
a
gentleman
against
whom
the
breath
of
calumny
has
never
yet
been
drawn
of
a
gentleman
who
in
all
the
relations
of
life
whether
as
a
husband
a
a
shooter
or
a
grocer
has
invariably
preserved
that
character
and
reputation
so
valuable
in
commercial
life
so
necessary
in
the
sporting
world
and
so
indispensable
to
a
man
moving
in
general
society
were
i
to
look
round
london
town
in
search
of
a
bright
specimen
of
a
man
combining
the
upright
sterling
integrity
of
the
honourable
british
merchant
of
former
days
with
the
ardour
of
the
english
of
modern
times
i
would
select
my
most
respectable
client
jorrocks
he
is
a
man
for
youth
to
imitate
and
revere
conceive
then
the
horror
of
a
man
of
his
delicate
sensibility
of
his
nervous
dread
of
depreciation
being
compelled
to
appear
here
this
day
to
vindicate
his
character
nay
more
his
honour
from
one
of
the
foulest
attempts
at
conspiracy
that
was
ever
directed
against
any
individual
i
say
that
a
grosser
attack
was
never
made
upon
the
character
of
any
grocer
and
i
look
confidently
to
the
reversion
of
this
unjust
unprecedented
conviction
and
to
the
triumphant
victory
of
my
most
respectable
and
client
it
is
not
for
the
sake
of
the
few
paltry
shillings
that
he
appeals
to
this
court
it
is
not
for
the
sake
of
calling
in
question
the
power
of
the
constituted
authorities
of
this
county
but
it
is
for
the
vindication
and
preservation
of
a
character
dear
to
all
men
but
doubly
dear
to
a
grocer
and
which
once
lost
can
never
be
regained
look
i
say
upon
my
client
as
he
sits
below
the
and
say
if
in
that
countenance
there
appears
any
indication
of
a
lawless
or
rebellious
spirit
look
i
say
if
the
milk
of
human
kindness
is
not
strikingly
portrayed
in
every
feature
and
truly
may
i
exclaim
in
the
words
of
the
poet
if
to
his
share
some
trifling
errors
fall
look
in
his
face
and
you
forget
them
all
i
regret
to
be
compelled
to
trespass
upon
the
valuable
time
of
the
court
but
sir
this
appeal
is
based
on
a
trespass
and
one
good
trespass
deserves
another
the
learned
gentleman
then
proceeded
to
detail
the
proceedings
of
the
day
shooting
and
afterwards
to
analyse
the
enactments
of
the
new
game
bill
which
he
denounced
as
arbitrary
oppressive
and
ridiculous
and
concluded
a
long
and
energetic
speech
by
calling
upon
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
magistrate
and
not
support
the
preposterous
position
of
fining
a
man
for
a
trespass
committed
by
his
toe
after
a
few
minutes
had
elapsed
mr
sergeant
bumptious
a
stiff
little
man
desperately
pitted
with
the
smallpox
rose
to
reply
and
looking
round
the
court
thus
commenced
years
have
i
passed
in
courts
of
justice
but
never
during
a
long
and
extensive
practice
have
i
witnessed
so
gross
a
perversion
of
that
sublimest
gift
called
eloquence
as
within
the
last
hour
here
he
banged
his
brief
against
the
table
and
looked
at
smirk
who
i
lament
sir
that
it
has
not
been
employed
in
a
better
cause
bang
again
and
another
look
my
learned
friend
has
indeed
laboured
to
make
the
worse
appear
the
better
cause
to
convert
into
a
trifle
one
of
the
most
outrageous
acts
that
ever
disgraced
a
human
being
or
a
civilised
country
well
did
he
describe
the
importance
of
this
case
important
as
regards
his
client
character
important
as
regards
this
great
and
populous
county
important
as
regards
those
social
ties
by
which
society
is
held
together
important
as
regards
a
legislative
enactment
and
important
as
regards
the
and
prosperity
of
the
whole
nation
bang
bang
bang
i
admire
the
bombastic
eloquence
with
which
my
learned
friend
introduced
his
most
distinguished
client
his
most
delicate
minded
sensitive
client
truly
to
hear
him
speaking
i
should
have
thought
he
had
been
describing
a
lovely
blushing
young
lady
but
when
he
comes
to
exhibit
his
paragon
of
perfection
and
points
out
that
great
coarse
lubberly
lump
of
humanity
here
bumptious
looked
at
jorrocks
as
he
would
eat
him
sitting
below
the
and
seeks
to
enlist
the
sympathies
of
your
worships
on
the
bench
of
you
gentlemen
the
shrewd
penetrating
judges
of
this
important
cause
and
bumptious
smiled
and
bowed
along
the
bench
upon
all
whose
eyes
he
could
catch
on
behalf
of
such
a
monster
of
iniquity
it
does
make
one
blush
for
the
degradation
of
the
british
bar
bang
bang
bang
jorrocks
here
looked
unutterable
things
does
my
learned
friend
think
by
displaying
his
hero
as
a
and
extolling
his
prowess
in
the
field
to
gain
over
the
sporting
magistrates
on
the
bench
he
knows
little
of
the
upright
integrity
the
uncompromising
honesty
the
undeviating
inflexible
impartiality
that
pervades
the
breast
of
every
member
of
this
tribunal
if
he
thinks
for
the
sake
of
gain
fear
favour
hope
or
reward
to
influence
the
opinion
much
less
turn
the
judgment
of
any
one
of
them
here
bumptious
bowed
very
low
to
them
all
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
tomkins
nodded
approbation
far
far
be
it
from
me
to
dwell
with
unbecoming
asperity
on
the
conduct
of
anyone
we
are
all
mortals
and
alike
liable
to
err
but
when
i
see
a
man
who
has
been
guilty
of
an
act
which
has
brought
him
all
but
within
the
verge
of
the
prisoners
dock
i
say
when
i
see
a
man
who
has
been
guilty
of
such
an
outrage
on
society
as
this
ruffian
jorrocks
come
forward
with
the
daring
effrontery
that
he
has
this
day
done
and
claim
redress
where
he
himself
is
the
offender
it
does
create
a
feeling
in
my
mind
divided
between
disgust
and
amazement
bang
here
jorrock
cauldron
boiled
over
and
rising
from
his
seat
with
an
outstretched
fist
he
bawled
out
d
n
you
sir
what
do
you
mean
the
court
was
thrown
into
amazement
and
even
bumptious
quailed
before
the
fist
of
the
mighty
jorrocks
i
claim
the
protection
of
the
court
he
exclaimed
tomkins
interposed
and
said
he
should
certainly
order
jorrocks
into
custody
if
he
repeated
his
conduct
adding
that
it
was
most
disrespectful
to
the
justices
of
our
lord
the
king
bumptious
paused
a
little
to
gather
breath
and
a
fresh
volume
of
venom
wherewith
to
annihilate
jorrocks
and
catching
his
eye
he
transfixed
him
like
a
rattlesnake
and
again
resumed
how
stands
the
case
said
he
this
cockney
grocer
for
after
all
he
is
nothing
else
who
i
dare
say
scarcely
knows
a
hawk
from
a
leaves
his
figs
and
raisins
and
sets
out
on
a
marauding
excursion
into
the
county
of
surrey
and
regardless
of
property
of
boundaries
of
laws
of
liberties
of
life
itself
strides
over
every
man
land
letting
drive
at
whatever
comes
in
his
way
the
hare
he
shot
on
this
occasion
was
a
pet
hare
for
three
successive
summers
had
miss
cheatum
watched
and
fed
it
with
all
the
interest
and
anxiety
of
a
parent
i
leave
it
to
you
gentlemen
who
have
daughters
of
your
own
with
pets
also
to
picture
to
yourselves
the
agony
of
her
mind
in
finding
that
her
favourite
had
found
its
way
down
the
throat
of
that
great
guzzling
gormandising
cockney
cormorant
and
then
forsooth
because
he
is
fined
for
the
outrageous
trespass
he
comes
here
as
the
injured
party
and
instructs
his
counsel
to
indulge
in
billingsgate
abuse
that
would
disgrace
the
mouth
of
an
old
bailey
practitioner
i
regret
that
instead
of
the
insignificant
fine
imposed
upon
him
the
law
did
not
empower
the
worthy
magistrate
to
send
him
to
the
treadmill
there
to
recreate
himself
for
six
or
eight
months
as
a
warning
to
the
whole
fraternity
of
lawless
vagabonds
here
he
nodded
his
head
at
jorrocks
as
much
as
to
say
i
trounce
you
my
boy
he
then
produced
maps
and
plans
of
the
different
estates
and
a
model
of
the
shed
to
show
how
it
had
all
happened
and
after
going
through
the
case
in
such
a
strain
as
would
induce
one
to
believe
it
was
a
trial
for
murder
or
high
treason
concluded
as
follows
the
eyes
of
england
are
upon
us
reverse
this
conviction
and
you
let
loose
a
rebel
band
upon
the
country
ripe
for
treason
stratagem
or
spoil
you
overturn
the
finest
order
of
society
in
the
world
henceforth
no
man
property
will
be
safe
the
laws
will
be
disregarded
and
even
the
upright
talented
and
independent
magistracy
of
england
brought
into
contempt
but
i
feel
convinced
that
your
decision
will
be
far
otherwise
that
by
it
you
will
teach
these
rebellious
radical
grocers
that
they
can
not
offend
with
impunity
and
show
them
that
there
is
a
law
which
reaches
even
the
lowest
and
meanest
inhabitant
of
these
realms
that
amid
these
days
of
anarchy
and
innovation
you
will
support
the
laws
and
aristocracy
of
this
country
that
you
will
preserve
to
our
children
and
our
children
those
rights
and
blessings
which
a
great
and
enlightened
administration
have
conferred
upon
ourselves
and
raise
for
tomkins
of
tomkins
and
the
magistracy
of
the
proud
county
of
surrey
a
name
resplendent
in
modern
times
and
venerated
to
all
eternity
here
bumptious
cast
a
parting
frown
at
jorrocks
and
banging
down
his
brief
tucked
his
gown
under
his
arm
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
the
court
to
indulge
in
a
glass
of
pale
sherry
and
a
sandwich
regardless
which
way
the
verdict
went
so
long
as
he
had
given
him
a
good
quilting
the
silence
that
followed
had
the
effect
of
rousing
some
of
the
dozing
justices
who
nudging
those
who
had
fallen
asleep
they
all
began
to
stir
themselves
and
having
laid
their
heads
together
during
which
time
they
settled
the
for
that
day
and
the
meets
of
the
staghounds
for
the
next
fortnight
they
began
to
talk
of
the
matter
before
the
court

for
reversing

squire
jolthead
jorrocks
is
such
a
capital
fellow
i
must
support

said
squire
hicks
he
gave
me
a
turn
when
i
made
the
mistaken
commitment
of
gipsy
jack
what
do
you
say
mr
giles
inquired
tomkins
oh
anything
you
like
mr
tomkins
and
you
mr

had
been
asleep
all
the
time
oh
guilty
i
should

three
months
at

whichever
side
bumptious
was
counsel
the
learned
serjeant
having
married
his
sister
and
four
others
always
followed
the
chair
tomkins
then
turned
round
the
magistrates
resumed
their
seats
along
the
bench
and
coming
forward
he
stood
before
the
judge
chair
and
taking
off
his
hat
with
solemn
dignity
and
precision
laid
it
down
exactly
in
the
centre
of
the
desk
amid
cries
from
the
bailiffs
and
ushers
for
silence
while
the
justices
of
the
peace
of
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
deliver
the
judgment
of
the
court
the
appellant
in
this
case
said
tomkins
very
slowly
seeks
to
set
aside
a
conviction
for
trespass
on
the
ground
as
i
understand
of
his
not
having
committed
one
the
principal
points
of
the
case
are
admitted
as
also
the
fact
of
jorrocks
toe
or
a
part
of
his
toe
having
intruded
upon
the
respondent
estate
now
so
far
as
that
point
is
concerned
it
seems
clear
to
myself
and
to
my
brother
magistrates
that
it
mattereth
not
how
much
or
how
little
of
the
toe
was
upon
the
land
so
long
as
any
part
thereof
was
there
minimis
non
curat
lex
the
english
of
which
is
law
taketh
no
cognisance
of
fractions
is
a
maxim
among
the
salaried
judges
of
the
inferior
courts
in
westminster
hall
which
we
the
unpaid
the
magistrates
of
the
proud
county
of
surrey
have
adopted
in
the
very
deep
and
mature
deliberation
that
preceded
the
formation
of
our
most
solemn
judgment
in
the
present
great
and
important
case
we
the
unpaid
magistrates
of
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
do
not
consider
it
necessary
that
there
should
be
toe
a
whole
toe
and
nothing
but
a
toe
to
constitute
a
trespass
any
more
than
it
would
be
necessary
in
the
case
of
an
assault
to
prove
that
the
kick
was
given
by
the
foot
the
whole
foot
and
nothing
but
the
foot
if
any
part
of
the
toe
was
there
the
law
considers
that
it
was
there
upon
this
doctrine
it
is
clear
that
jorrocks
was
guilty
of
a
trespass
and
the
conviction
must
be
affirmed
before
i
dismiss
the
case
i
must
say
a
few
words
on
the
statute
under
which
this
decision
takes
place
this
is
the
first
conviction
that
has
taken
place
since
the
passing
of
the
act
and
will
serve
as
a
precedent
throughout
all
england
i
congratulate
the
country
upon
the
efficacy
of
the
tribunal
to
which
it
has
been
submitted
the
court
has
listened
with
great
and
becoming
attention
to
the
arguments
of
the
counsel
on
both
sides
and
though
one
gentleman
with
a
flippant
ignorance
has
denounced
this
new
law
as
inferior
to
the
system
and
a
curse
to
the
country
we
the
magistrates
of
the
proud
county
of
surrey
must
enter
our
protest
against
such
a
doctrine
being
promulgated
peradventure
you
are
all
acquainted
with
my
prowess
as
a
shooter
i
won
two
silver
tankards
at
the
red
house
anno
domini
i
mention
this
to
show
that
i
am
a
practical
sportsman
and
as
to
the
theory
of
the
game
laws
i
derive
my
information
from
the
same
source
that
you
may
all
derive
yours
from
the
bright
refulgent
pages
of
the
sporting
iv
jorrocks
and
the
surrey
staghounds
the
surrey
foxhounds
had
closed
their
season
a
most
brilliant
one
but
ere
jorrocks
consigned
his
boots
and
breeches
to
their
summer
slumber
he
bethought
of
having
a
look
at
the
surrey
staghounds
a
pack
now
numbered
among
the
things
that
were
of
course
he
required
a
companion
were
it
only
to
have
some
one
to
criticise
the
hounds
with
so
the
evening
before
the
appointed
day
as
the
yorkshireman
was
sitting
in
his
old
corner
at
the
far
end
of
the
piazza
in
covent
garden
having
just
finished
his
second
marrowbone
and
glass
of
white
brandy
george
the
only
waiter
in
the
room
with
a
name
came
smirking
up
with
a
card
in
his
hand
saying
that
the
gentleman
was
waiting
outside
to
speak
with
him
it
was
a
printed
one
but
the
large
round
hand
in
which
the
address
had
been
filled
up
encroaching
upon
the
letters
had
made
the
name
somewhat
difficult
to
decipher
at
length
he
puzzled
out
john
jorrocks
coram
street
the
name
of
the
city
house
or
shop
in
the
corner
lane
being
struck
through
with
a
pen
oh
ask
him
to
walk
in
directly
said
the
yorkshireman
to
george
who
trotted
off
and
presently
the
flapping
of
the
doors
in
the
passage
announced
his
approach
and
honest
jorrocks
came
rolling
up
the
room
not
like
a
or
any
other
sort
of
hunter
but
like
an
honest
wholesale
grocer
fresh
from
the
city
my
dear
fellow
i
so
glad
to
see
you
you
ca
think
said
he
advancing
with
both
hands
out
and
hugging
the
yorkshireman
after
the
manner
of
a
polar
bear
i
have
not
time
to
stay
one
moment
i
have
to
meet
wiggins
at
the
corner
of
bloomsbury
square
at
a
quarter
to
six
and
it
wants
now
only
seven
minutes
to
casting
his
eye
up
at
the
clock
over
the
i
have
just
called
to
say
that

you
are
fond

of
thing

a
mind

a
day

staghounds

that
sort
of
thing

the
yorkshireman

jorrocks

minute

he

the
area
bell
and
then
j
wo
hear
know
you
do
like
j
no
more
than
myself
at
the
appointed
hour
the
yorkshireman
reached
great
coram
street
just
as
old
jorrocks
had
opened
the
door
to
look
down
the
street
for
him
he
was
dressed
in
a
fine
flowing
frock
made
like
a
with
a
black
velvet
collar
having
a
gold
embroidered
stag
on
each
side
gilt
with
rich
embossed
edges
an
acre
of
buff
waistcoat
and
a
most
antediluvian
pair
of
bright
buckskins
made
by
white
of
tarporley
in
the
year
of
the
reign
of
george
the
third
they
were
and
patched
at
both
knees
with
a
slit
up
behind
the
coat
he
had
won
in
a
bet
and
the
breeches
in
a
raffle
the
latter
being
then
second
or
third
hand
his
boots
were
airing
before
the
fire
consequently
he
displayed
an
amplitude
of
calf
in
grey
worsted
stockings
while
his
feet
were
thrust
into
green
slippers
so
glad
to
see
you
said
he
here
a
charming
morning
indeed
regular
southerly
wind
and
a
cloudy
sky
rare
scenting
it
will
be
think
i
could
almost
run
a
stag
myself
come
in
never
mind
your
hat
hang
it
anywhere
but
do
make
a
noise
i
stole
away
and
left
j
snoring
so
do
to
wake
her
you
know
by
the
way
you
should
see
my
hat
batsey
fatch
my
hat
out
of
the
back
parlour
i
set
up
a
new
green
silk
cord
with
a
gold
frog
to
fasten
it
to
my
werry
illigant
i
think
and
werry
suitable
to
the
dress
quite
my
own
idea
have
a
notion
all
the
surrey
chaps
will
get
them
for
between
you
and
me
i
set
the
fashions
and
what
is
more
i
sometimes
set
them
at
a
leap
too
but
now
tell
me
have
you
any
objection
to
breakfasting
in
the
kitchen
more
retired
you
know
besides
which
you
get
everything
hot
and
hot
which
is
what
i
call
doing
a
bit
of
plisure
not
at
all
said
the
yorkshireman
so
lead
the
way
and
down
they
walked
to
the
lower
regions
it
was
a
nice
place
with
a
blazing
fire
half
the
floor
covered
with
an
old
and
the
rest
exhibiting
the
cheerless
aspect
of
the
naked
flags
about
a
yard
and
a
half
from
the
fire
was
placed
the
breakfast
table
in
the
centre
stood
a
magnificent
uncut
ham
with
a
great
quartern
loaf
on
one
side
and
a
huge
bologna
sausage
on
the
other
besides
these
there
were
nine
eggs
two
pyramids
of
muffins
a
great
deal
of
toast
a
dozen
and
half
a
while
a
dozen
kidneys
were
spluttering
on
a
spit
before
the
fire
and
betsy
held
a
gridiron
covered
with
on
the
top
altogether
there
was
as
much
as
would
have
served
ten
people
now
sit
down
said
jorrocks
and
let
us
be
doing
for
i
am
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
hope
you
are
peckish
too
what
shall
i
give
you
tea
or
coffee
but
take
both
coffee
first
and
tea
after
a
bit
if
i
give
you
them
good
do
know
who
can
you
must
pay
your
devours
as
we
say
in
france
to
the
for
it
is
an
especial
fine
one
and
do
take
a
few
eggs
with
it
there
i
not
given
you
above
a
pound
of
but
you
can
come
again
you
know
waste
not
want
not
now
take
some
muffins
do
pray
batsey
bring
some
more
cream
and
set
the
kidneys
on
the
table
the
yorkshireman
is
getting
nothing
to
eat
have
a
chop
with
your
kidney
werry
luxterous
i
could
eat
an
elephant
stuffed
with
grenadiers
and
wash
them
down
with
a
ocean
of
tea
but
pray
lay
in
to
the
breakfast
or
i
shall
think
you
do
like
it
there
now
take
some
tea
and
toast
or
one
of
those
biscuits
or
whatever
you
like
would
a
little
more
be
agreeable
batsey
run
into
the
larder
and
see
if
your
missis
left
any
of
that
cold
chine
of
pork
last
night
and
hear
bring
the
cold
goose
and
any
cold
flesh
you
can
lay
hands
on
there
are
really
no
wittles
on
the
table
i
am
quite
ashamed
to
set
you
down
to
such
a
scanty
fork
breakfast
but
this
is
what
comes
of
not
being
master
of
your
own
house
hope
your
hat
may
long
cover
your
family
rely
upon
it
it
is
cheaper
to
buy
your
bacon
than
to
keep
a
pig
just
as
jorrocks
uttered
these
last
words
the
side
door
opened
and
without
either
with
your
leave
or
by
your
leave
in
bounced
jorrocks
in
an
elegant
dishabille
or
as
jorrocks
pronounced
it
with
her
hair
tucked
up
in
papers
and
a
pair
of
worsted
slippers
on
her
feet
worked
with
roses
and
blue
lilies
pray
mister
j
said
she
taking
no
more
notice
of
the
yorkshireman
than
if
he
had
been
enveloped
in
jack
the
coat
of
darkness
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
card
i
found
it
in
your
best
coat
pocket
which
you
had
on
last
night
and
i
do
desire
sir
that
you
will
tell
me
how
it
came
there
good
morning
sir
spying
the
yorkshireman
at
last
perhaps
you
know
where
jorrocks
was
last
night
and
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
who
this
person
is
whose
card
i
have
found
in
the
corner
of
jorrocks
best
coat
pocket
indeed
madam
replied
the
yorkshireman
jorrocks
movements
of
yesterday
evening
are
quite
a
secret
to
me
it
is
the
night
that
he
usually
spends
at
the
magpie
and
stump
but
whether
he
was
there
or
not
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
not
being
a
member
of
the
free
and
easy
club
as
for
the
card
madam
there
then
take
it
and
read
it
interrupted
j
and
he
took
the
card
accordingly
a
delicate
pale
pink
with
blue
borders
and
gilt
edge
and
read
we
would
fain
put
it
all
in
dashes
and
asterisks
miss
juliana
granville
john
street
waterloo
road
this
digression
giving
jorrocks
a
moment
or
two
to
recollect
himself
he
pretended
to
get
into
a
thundering
passion
and
seizing
the
card
out
of
the
yorkshireman
hand
he
thrust
it
into
the
fire
swearing
it
was
an
application
for
admission
into
the
deaf
and
dumb
institution
where
he
wished
he
had
j
the
yorkshireman
seeing
the
probability
of
a
breeze
pretended
to
have
forgotten
something
at
the
piazza
and
stole
away
begging
jorrocks
to
pick
him
up
as
he
passed
peace
had
soon
been
restored
for
the
yorkshireman
had
not
taken
above
three
or
four
turns
up
and
down
the
ere
george
the
waiter
came
to
say
that
a
gentleman
waited
outside
putting
on
his
hat
and
taking
a
coat
over
his
arm
he
turned
out
when
just
before
the
door
he
saw
a
man
muffled
up
in
a
great
military
cloak
and
a
glazed
hat
endeavouring
to
back
a
nondescript
carriage
with
lofty
mail
and
red
wheels
close
to
the
pavement
said
he
horse
at
the
same
time
jerking
at
his
mouth
as
the
yorkshireman
made
his
exit
a
pair
eyes
of
gleamed
through
the
small
aperture
between
the
high
cloak
collar
and
the
flipe
of
the
glazed
hat
which
he
instantly
recognised
to
belong
to
jorrocks
why
what
the
deuce
is
this
you
are
in
said
he
looking
at
the
vehicle
jump
up
said
jorrocks
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
which
having
done
and
the
machine
being
set
in
motion
he
proceeded
to
relate
the
manner
in
which
he
had
exchanged
his
for
it
by
the
way
as
arrant
a
as
ever
unfortunate
got
into
but
which
he
with
the
predilection
all
men
have
for
their
own
pronounced
to
be
a
monstrous
nice
carriage
on
their
turning
off
the
rough
pavement
on
to
the
quiet
smooth
macadamised
road
leading
to
waterloo
bridge
his
dissertation
was
interrupted
by
a
loud
raised
by
two
or
three
and
boys
lounging
about
the
gate
i
say
tom
twig
this
machine
said
one
dash
my
buttons
i
never
seed
such
a
thing
in
all
my
life
what

pay
inquired
jorrocks
pulling
up
with
great
dignity
their
observations
not
having
penetrated
the
cloak
collar
which
encircled
his
ears
to
pay
said
the
vy

pulled
down
his
collar
to

what
he
had
to
pay
but

haste
or
the
fire
will
be
out
bawled
out
another
as
jorrocks
whipped
on
and
rattled
out
of
hearing
now
you
see
said
he
resuming
the
thread
of
his
discourse
as
if
nothing
had
happened
this
back
seat
turns
down
and
makes
a
box
so
that
when
j
goes
to
her
mother
at
tooting
she
can
take
all
her
things
with
her
instead
of
sending
half
of
them
by
the
coach
as
she
used
to
do
and
if
we
are
heavy
there
is
a
pole
belonging
to
it
so
that
we
can
have
two
horses
and
then
there
is
a
seat
draws
out
here
pulling
a
stool
from
between
his
legs
which
anybody
can
sit
on
yes
anybody
that
is
small
enough
said
the
yorkshireman
but
you
would
cut
a
queer
figure
on
it
i
reckon
the
truth
was
that
the
was
one
of
those
useless
affairs
built
by
some
fool
upon
a
plan
of
his
own
with
the
idea
of
combining
every
possible
comfort
and
advantage
and
in
reality
not
possessing
one
friend
jorrocks
had
seen
it
at
a
shop
in
fore
street
and
became
the
happy
owner
of
it
in
exchange
for
the
and
seventeen
their
appearance
on
the
road
created
no
small
sensation
and
many
were
the
jokes
passed
upon
the
one
said
they
were
mountebanks
another
that
it
was
a
a
third
asked
if
it
was
one
of
gurney
while
a
fourth
swore
it
was
a
new
going
to
brixton
jorrocks
either
did
not
or
would
not
hear
their
remarks
and
kept
expatiating
upon
the
different
purposes
to
which
the
machine
might
be
converted
and
the
stoutness
of
the
horse
that
was
drawing
it
as
they
approached
the
town
of
croydon
he
turned
his
cloak
over
his
legs
in
a
very
manner
and
was
instantly
hailed
by
some
brother
sportsmen
one
complimented
him
on
his
looks
another
on
his
breeches
a
third
praised
his
horse
a
fourth
abused
the
and
a
fifth
inquired
where
he
got
his
glazed
hat
he
had
an
answer
for
them
all
and
a
nod
or
a
wink
for
every
pretty
maid
that
showed
at
the
windows
for
though
past
the
grand
climacteric
he
still
has
a
spice
of
the
devil
in
him
and
as
he
says
there
is
no
harm
in
looking
the
red
lion
at
smitham
bottom
was
the
rendezvous
of
the
day
it
is
a
small
inn
on
the
brighton
road
some
three
or
four
miles
below
croydon
on
the
left
of
the
road
stands
the
inn
on
the
right
is
a
small
and
the
country
about
is
open
common
and
down
there
was
an
immense
muster
about
the
inn
and
also
on
the
consisting
of
horsemen
footmen
jorrocks
and
the
yorkshireman
made
the
firemen
here
old
jorrocks
i
do
declare
exclaimed
one
as
jorrocks
drove
the
up
at
as
quick
a
pace
as
his
horse
would
go
why
what
a
concern
he
in
said
another
why
the
old
man
mad
surely
he
good
for
a
subscription
added
another
addressing
him
i
say
jorrocks
old
boy
you
give
us
ten
pound
for
our
hounds
wo
you
that
a
good
fellow
oh
yes
jorrocks
promised
us
a
subscription
last
year
observed
another
and
he
is
a
man
of
his
word
ar

old
leather
breeches

jorrocks
standing
up
in
the
and
sticking
the
whip
into
its
nest
i
really
can
not
i
wish
i
could
but
i
really
can
not
afford
it
times
really
are
so
bad
and
i
have
my
own
pack
to
subscribe
to
and
i
must
be
before
i
am
generous
oh
but
ten
pounds
is
nothing
in
your
way
you
know
jorrocks
adulterate
a
chest
of
tea
old
here
will
give
you
all
the
leaves
off
his
no
said
jorrocks
i
really

i
must
cut

jove
but
you
must
have
had
plenty
of
cloth
when
you
cut
that
coat
you
got
on
old
boy
why
there
as
much
cloth
in
the
laps
as
would
make
a
pair
of
never
mind
said
jorrocks
i
wear
it
and
not
you
now
said
jorrocks
in
an
undertone
to
the
yorkshireman
you
see
what
an
unconscionable
set
of
dogs
these
are
they
at
every
man
for
a
subscription
and
talk
about
guineas
as
if
they
grew
upon
besides
they
are
such
a
rubbishing
set
all
drafts
from
the
now
there
a
chap
on
a
piebald
just
by
the
trees
he
goes
into
the
reglarly
once
in
three
years
and
yet
to
see
him
out
you
fancy
all
the
country
round
belonged
to
him
and
there
a
buck
with
his
so
tight
that
he
can
hardly
move
his
neck
pointing
to
a
gentleman
in
scarlet
with
a
tremendous
stiff
blue
cravat
he
lives
by
keeping
a
and
being
werry
high
consequential
sort
of
a
cock
they
calls
him
the
high
keeper
i
tell
ye
a
joke
about
that
fellow
said
he
pointing
to
a
man
alighting
from
a
buggy
he
a
werry
shabby
screw
and
is
always
trying
to
save
a
well
he
hires
a
young
hawbuck
for
a
servant
who
did
clean
his
boots
to
his
liking
so
he
began
reading
the
riot
act
one
day
and
concluded
by
saying
blowed
if
i
could
clean
them
better
myself
with
a
little
the
next
day
up
came
the
boots
duller
than
my
soul
exclaimed
he
they
are
worse
than
before
how
this
sir
sir
you
said
you
could
clean
them
better
with
a
little
so
i
tried
it
and
i
do
think
they
are
worse
haw
haw
haw
yon
chap
in
the
black
plush
breeches
and
hessians
standing
by
the
tray
is
the
only
man
what
ever
got
the
better
of
me
in
the
line
and
he
certainlie
did
bite
me
uncommon
i
gave
him
three
and
twenty
pounds
a
strong
violin
case
with
patent
hinges
lined
with
superfine
green
baize
and
an
uncut
copy
of
middleton
for
an
that
the
blacksmith
really
declared
was
worth
howsomever
i
paid
him
off
for
i
christened
the
barabbas
who
you
knows
was
a
robber
and
the
seller
has
gone
by
the
name
of
barabbas
ever
since
well
but
tell
me
gentlemen
where
do
we
dine
inquired
jorrocks
turning
to
a
group
who
had
just
approached
the
we
know
yet
said
a
gentleman
in
scarlet
the
deer
has
not
come
yet
but
yonder
he
is
pointing
up
the
road
to
a
covered
cart
and
there
are
the
hounds
just
coming
over
the
hill
at
the
back
the
covered
cart
approached
and
several
went
to
meet
it
the
cry
of
oh
it
old
tunbridge
was
soon
heard
well
we
shall
have
a
good
dinner
said
jorrocks
if
that
is
the
case
is
it
tunbridge
inquired
he
eagerly
of
one
of
the
party
who
returned
from
the
yes
it
old
tunbridge
and
snooks
has
ordered
dinner
at
the
wells
for
sixteen
at
five
so
the
first
sixteen
that
get
there
had
better
look
out
here
bouy
said
jorrocks
in
an
undertone
to
his
servant
who
was
leading
his
screws
about
on
the
green
take
this
out
of
the
carriage
and
give
him
a
feed
of
corn
and
then
go
on
to
tunbridge
wells
and
tell
pegg
at
the
sussex
arms
that
i
shall
be
there
with
a
friend
to
the
dinner
and
bid
him
write
upon
two
plates
and
place
them
nothing
like
making
sure
said
he
chuckling
at
his
own
acuteness
now
to
to
exclaimed
he
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
and
climbing
on
to
his
great
chestnut
leaving
the
yorkshireman
to
mount
the
brown
let
have
a
look
at
the
turning
his
horse
in
the
direction
in
which
they
were
coming
jonathan
griffin
took
off
his
cap
to
jorrocks
as
he
approached
who
waved
his
hand
in
the
most
patronising
manner
possible
adding
how
are
you
jonathan
pretty
well
thank
you
mister
jorrocks
hope
you
the
same
no
not
the
same
for
i
werry
well
which
makes
all
the
difference
haw
haw
haw
you
seem
to
have
but
a
shortish
pack
i
think
ten
twelve
fourteen
couple
that
we
always
take
nine
and
twenty
with
the
surrey
why
you
see
mister
jorrocks
and
are
very
different
the
scent
of
the
deer
is
very
ravishing
and
then
we
have
no
drawing
for
our
game
besides
at
this
season
there
are
always
bitches
to
put
back
but
we
have
plenty
of
hounds
for
i
suppose
we
may
be
after
turning
out
added
jonathan
looking
at
his
watch
it
past
eleven
footnote
poor
jonathan
one
of
the
hardest
riders
and
drinkers
of
his
day
exists
like
his
pack
but
in
the
recollection
of
mankind
he
was
long
huntsman
to
the
late
lord
derby
who
when
he
gave
up
his
staghounds
made
jonathan
a
present
of
them
and
for
two
or
three
seasons
he
scratched
on
in
an
indifferent
sort
of
way
until
the
hounds
were
sold
to
go
abroad
to
hungary
we
believe
on
hearing
this
a
gentleman
off
with
his
glove
and
began
collecting
or
capping
prior
to
turning
out
it
being
the
rule
of
the
hunt
to
make
sure
of
the
money
before
starting
for
fear
of
accidents
half
a
crown
if
you
please
sir
now
i
take
your
half
a
crown
jorrocks
shall
i
trouble
you
for
half
a
crown
oh
surely
said
jorrocks
pulling
out
a
handful
of
great
pieces
here
for
this
gentleman
and
myself
handing
one
of
them
over
and
i
sha
even
ask
you
for
discount
for
ready
money
the
capping
went
round
and
a
goodly
sum
was
collected
meanwhile
the
was
drawn
to
the
far
side
of
a
thick
fence
and
the
door
being
opened
a
animal
as
big
as
a
donkey
blobbed
out
and
began
feeding
very
composedly
that
wo
do
said
jonathan
griffin
eyeing
him
ride
on
tom
and
whip
him
away
off
went
the
whip
followed
by
a
score
of
sportsmen
whose
shouts
aided
by
the
cracking
of
their
whips
would
have
frightened
the
devil
himself
and
these
worthies
knowing
the
hounds
would
catch
them
up
in
due
time
resolved
themselves
into
a
hunt
for
the
present
and
pursued
the
animal
themselves
ten
minutes
having
expired
and
the
hounds
seeming
likely
to
break
away
jonathan
thought
it
advisable
to
let
them
have
their
wicked
will
and
accordingly
they
rushed
off
in
full
cry
to
the
spot
where
the
deer
had
been
uncarted
of
course
there
was
no
trouble
in
casting
for
the
scent
indeed
they
were
very
honest
and
did
not
pretend
to
any
mystery
the
hounds
knew
within
an
inch
where
it
would
be
and
the
start
was
pretty
much
like
that
for
a
hunter
plate
in
heats
a
few
dashing
blades
rode
before
the
hounds
at
starting
but
otherwise
the
field
was
tolerably
quiet
and
was
considerably
diminished
after
the
three
first
leaps
the
scent
improved
as
did
the
pace
and
presently
they
got
into
a
lane
along
which
they
rattled
for
five
miles
as
hard
as
ever
they
could
lay
legs
to
the
ground
throwing
the
mud
into
each
other
faces
until
each
man
looked
as
if
he
was
roughcast
a
kentish
wagon
drawn
by
six
oxen
taking
up
the
whole
of
the
lane
had
obliged
the
dear
animal
to
take
to
the
fields
again
where
at
the
first
fence
most
of
our
racers
stood
still
in
truth
it
was
rather
a
nasty
place
a
yawning
ditch
with
a
mud
bank
and
a
rotten
landing
now
who
for
it
go
it
jorrocks
you
a
said
one
who
erecting
himself
in
his
stirrups
was
ogling
the
opposite
side
i
do
like
it
said
jorrocks
is
never
a
gate
near
oh
yes
at
the
bottom
of
the
field
and
away
they
all
tore
for
it
the
hounds
now
had
got
out
of
sight
but
were
heard
running
in
cover
at
the
bottom
of
the
into
which
they
had
just
passed
and
also
the
clattering
of
horses
hoofs
on
the
highway
the
hounds
came
out
several
times
on
to
the
road
evidently
carrying
the
scent
but
as
often
threw
up
and
returned
into
the
cover
the
huntsman
was
puzzled
at
last
and
quite
convinced
that
the
deer
was
not
in
the
wood
he
called
them
out
and
proceeded
to
make
a
cast
followed
by
the
majority
of
the
field
they
trotted
about
at
a
brisk
pace
first
to
the
right
then
to
the
left
afterwards
to
the
north
and
then
to
the
south
over
grass
fallow
turnips
potatoes
and
flints
through
three
farmyards
round
two
and
at
the
back
of
a
small
village
or
hamlet
without
a
note
save
those
of
a
few
babblers
everyone
seemed
to
consider
it
a
desperate
job
they
were
all
puzzled
at
last
they
heard
a
terrible
holloaing
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
south
and
immediately
after
was
espied
a
group
of
horsemen
galloping
along
the
road
at
full
speed
in
the
centre
of
which
was
jorrocks
his
green
coat
wide
open
with
the
tails
flying
a
long
way
behind
that
of
his
horse
his
right
leg
was
thrust
out
down
the
side
of
which
he
kept
applying
his
ponderous
hunting
whip
making
a
most
terrible
clatter
as
they
approached
he
singled
himself
out
from
the
group
and
was
the
first
to
reach
the
field
he
immediately
burst
out
into
one
of
his
usual
hunting
energetic
strains
oh
jonathan
griffin
jonathan
griffin
said
he
here
a
lamentable
occurrence
a
terrible
disaster
oh
dear
oh
dear
we
shall
never
get
to
tunbridge
that
unfortunate
deer
has
escaped
us
and
we
shall
never
see
nothing
more
of
him
rely
upon
it
killed
before
this
why
how
that
inquired
griffin
evidently
in
a
terrible
perturbation
why
said
jorrocks
slapping
the
whip
down
his
leg
again
there
a
little
girl
tells
me
that
as
she
was
getting
water
at
the
well
just
at
the
end
of
the
wood
where
we
lost
him
she
saw
what
she
took
to
be
a
donkey
jump
into
a
return
from
the
at
seven
oaks
that
was
passing
along
the
road
with
the
door
swinging
wide
open
and
you
may
rely
upon
it
it
was
the
deer
the
landlord
of
the
will
have
cut
his
throat
before
this
for
you
know
he
vowed
wengeance
against
us
last
year
because
his
was
upset
and
he
swore
that
we
did
it
oh
but
that
a
bad
job
said
the
huntsman
what
shall
we
do
here
tom
calling
to
the
jump
on
to
the
hastings
coach
which
just
came
up
and
try
if
you
ca
overtake
him
and
bring
him
back
chaise
and
all
and
i
follow
slowly
with
the
hounds
tom
was
soon
up
the
coach
bowled
on
and
jonathan
and
the
hounds
trotted
gently
forward
till
they
came
to
a
here
as
they
stopped
lamenting
over
their
unhappy
fate
and
consoling
themselves
with
some
cold
sherry
negus
the
appeared
in
sight
with
the
deer
head
sticking
out
of
the
side
window
with
all
the
dignity
of
a
lord
mayor
huzza
huzza
huzza
exclaimed
jorrocks
taking
off
his
hat
here
old
tunbridge
come
back
again
huzza
huzza
but
who
to
pay
me
for
the
said
the
driver
pulling
up
i
must
be
paid
before
i
let
him
out
how
much
says
jonathan
why
a
mile
to
be
sure
and
a
mile
to
the
driver
no
says
jorrocks
that
wo
do
yours
is
a
return
chay
however
here
five
shillings
for
you
and
now
jonathan
turn
him
out
again
he
quite
fresh
after
his
ride
and
see
he
got
some
straw
in
the
bottom
old
tunbridge
was
again
turned
out
with
his
head
towards
the
town
from
whence
he
took
his
name
and
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
law
the
pack
was
again
laid
on
he
was
not
however
in
very
good
wind
and
it
was
necessary
to
divide
the
second
chase
into
two
heats
for
which
purpose
the
hounds
were
whipped
off
about
the
middle
while
the
deer
took
a
cold
bath
after
which
he
was
again
set
by
three
they
had
accomplished
the
run
and
pegg
of
the
sussex
arms
having
mounted
his
pegasus
found
them
at
the
appointed
place
by
the
medway
where
old
tunbridge
carriage
was
waiting
into
which
having
handed
him
they
repaired
to
the
inn
and
at
five
eighteen
of
them
sat
down
to
a
dinner
consisting
of
every
delicacy
of
the
season
the
lord
high
keeper
in
the
chair
being
all
hungry
as
hunters
little
conversation
passed
until
after
the
removal
of
the
cloth
when
after
the
king
and
his
majesty
ministers
had
been
drunk
the
president
gave
the
noble
manly
sport
of
which
he
eulogised
as
the
most
legitimate
and
exhilarating
of
all
sports
and
sketched
its
progress
from
its
wild
state
of
infancy
when
the
unhappy
sportsmen
had
to
range
the
fields
and
forests
for
their
uncertain
game
to
the
present
state
of
luxurious
ease
and
elaborate
refinement
when
they
not
only
brought
their
deer
to
the
meet
but
by
selecting
the
proper
animal
could
insure
a
finish
at
the
place
they
most
wished
to
dine
at
all
of
which
was
most
enthusiastically
applauded
and
on
the
speaker
ending
and
the
surrey
staghounds
and
long
life
to
all
were
drank
in
brimming
and
overflowing
bumpers
all
wild
seasonable
and
legitimate
sports
followed
and
the
chairman
having
run
through
his
list
and
thinking
jorrocks
was
getting
rather
mellow
resolved
to
try
the
soothing
system
on
him
for
a
subscription
the
badgering
of
the
morning
not
having
answered
accordingly
he
called
on
the
company
to
charge
their
glasses
as
he
would
give
them
a
bumper
toast
which
he
knew
they
would
have
great
pleasure
in
he
wished
to
propose
the
health
of
his
excellent
friend
on
his
right
jorrocks
applause
a
gentleman
whose
name
only
required
mentioning
in
any
society
of
hunters
to
insure
it
a
hearty
and
enthusiastic
reception
he
did
not
flatter
his
excellent
friend
when
he
said
he
was
a
man
for
the
imitation
of
all
and
he
was
sure
that
when
the
present
company
recollected
the
liberal
support
he
gave
to
the
surrey
foxhounds
together
with
the
keenness
with
which
he
followed
that
branch
of
amusement
they
would
duly
appreciate
not
only
the
honour
he
had
conferred
upon
them
by
his
presence
in
the
field
that
morning
and
at
the
table
that
day
but
the
disinterested
generosity
which
had
prompted
him
voluntarily
to
declare
his
intention
of
contributing
to
the
future
support
of
the
surrey
staghounds
immense
cheers
he
therefore
thought
the
least
they
could
do
was
to
drink
the
health
of
jorrocks
and
success
to
the
surrey
foxhounds
with
three
times
three
which
was
immediately
responded
to
with
deafening
cheers
old
jorrocks
after
the
noise
had
subsided
got
on
his
legs
and
with
one
hand
rattling
the
pieces
in
his
and
the
thumb
of
the
other
thrust
into
the
of
his
waistcoat
thus
began
to
address

to
give

to

immense
cheers
followed
this
declaration
which
lasted
for
some
seconds
when
they
had
subsided
jorrocks
put
his
finger
on
his
nose
and
with
a
knowing
wink
of
his
eye
added
prowided
my
friend
the

juggins

and
the
sir
said
george
to
the
yorkshireman
on
one
of
the
fine
fresh
mornings
that
gently
usher
in
the
returning
spring
and
draw
from
the
cits
sighs
for
the
verdure
of
the
fields
as
he
placed
the
above
mentioned
articles
on
his
usual
breakfast
table
in
the
of
the
piazza
with
the
calm
deliberation
of
a
man
whose
whole
day
is
unoccupied
the
yorkshireman
sweetened
his
tea
drew
the
muffin
and
a
select
dish
of
prawns
to
his
elbow
and
turning
sideways
to
the
table
crossed
his
legs
and
prepared
to
con
the
contents
of
the
paper
the
first
page
as
usual
was
full
of
sales

the
fire
reviver
or

then
turning
it
over
his
eye
ranged
over
a
whole
meadow
of
type
consisting
of
the
previous
night
debate
followed
on
by
city

police
reports
fashionable
arrivals
and
departures

newmarket
craven
meeting
that
more
in
my
way
said
the
yorkshireman
to
himself
as
he
laid
down
the
paper
and
took
a
sip
of
his
tea
i
a
great
mind
to
go
for
i
may
just
as
well
be
at
newmarket
as
here
having
nothing
particular
to
do
in
either
place
i
came
to
stay
a
hundred
pounds
in
london
it
true
but
if
i
stay
ten
of
it
at
newmarket
it
be
all
the
same
and
i
can
go
home
from
there
just
as
well
as
from
here
so
saying
he
took
another
turn
at
the
tea
the
race

was

tempting
one

craven

sherry

and
all
other
sorts
a
good
week
racing
in

for
the
saintly
sinners
who
frequent
the
heath
had
not
then
discovered
any
greater
impropriety
in
travelling
on
a
sunday
then
in
cheating
each
other
on
the
monday
the
tea
was
good
as
were
the
prawns
and
eggs
and
george
brought
a
second
muffin
at
the
very
moment
that
the
yorkshireman
had
finished
the
last
piece
of
the
first
so
that
by
the
time
he
had
done
his
breakfast
and
drawn
on
his
boots
which
were
dryer
and
pleasanter
than
the
recent
damp
weather
had
allowed
of
their
being
he
felt
completely
at
peace
with
himself
and
all
the
world
and
putting
on
his
hat
sallied
forth
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
eat
a
good
breakfast
and
yet
not
too
much
newmarket
was
still
uppermost
in
his
mind
and
as
he
sauntered
along
in
the
direction
of
the
strand
it
occurred
to
him
that
perhaps
jorrocks
might
have
no
objection
to
accompany
him
on
entering
that
great
thoroughfare
of
humanity
he
turned
to
the
east
and
having
examined
the
contents
of
all
the
caricature
shops
in
the
line
and
paid
threepence
for
a
look
at
the
in
the
chapter
paul
churchyard
about
noon
he
reached
the
corner
of
botolph
lane
before
jorrocks
warehouse
great
bustle
and
symptoms
of
brisk
trade
were
visible
with
true
city
pride
the
name
on
the
was
in
small
letters
sufficiently
obscure
to
render
it
apparent
that
jorrocks
considered
his
house
required
no
sign
while
as
a
sort
of
contradiction
the
covered
before
it
bore
jorrocks
wholesale
tea
warehouse
in
great
gilt
letters
on
each
side
of
the
cover
so
large
that
he
who
runs
might
read
even
though
the
were
running
too
into
this
cart
which
was
drawn
by
the
celebrated
hunter
they
were
pitching
divers
packages
for
town
delivery
and
a
couple
of
light
porters
nearly
upset
the
yorkshireman
as
they
bustled
out
with
their
loads
the
warehouse
itself
gave
evident
proof
of
great
antiquity
it
was
not
one
of
your
fine
light
lofty
establishments
of
modern
times
where
the
often
consists
of
books
and
empty
canisters
but
a
large
roomy
gloomy
dirty
dingy
sort
of
cellar
above
ground
full
of
hogsheads
casks
flasks
jars
bags
bottles
and
boxes
the
floor
was
half
an
inch
thick
at
least
with
dirt
and
was
sprinkled
with
rice
currants
and
raisins
as
though
they
had
been
scattered
for
the
purpose
of
growing
a
small
corner
seemed
to
have
been
cut
off
like
the
fold
of
a
leicestershire
and
made
into
an
office
in
the
centre
of
which
was
a
square
or
two
of
glass
that
commanded
a
view
of
the
whole
warehouse
is
jorrocks
in
inquired
the
yorkshireman
of
a
porter
who
was
busy
digging
currants
with
a
wooden
spade
yes
sir
you
find
him
in
the
was
the
answer
but
on
looking
in
though
his
hat
and
gloves
were
there
no
jorrocks
was
visible
at
the
farther
end
of
the
warehouse
a
man
in
his
with
a
white
apron
round
his
waist
and
a
brown
paper
cap
on
his
head
was
seen
under
a
very
skylight
holding
his
head
over
something
as
if
his
nose
were
bleeding
the
yorkshireman
groped
his
way
up
to
him
and
asking
if
jorrocks
was
in
found
he
was
addressing
the
grocer
himself
he
had
been
leaning
over
a
large
trayful
of
little
white
cups
with
teapots
to
match
trying
the
strength
flavour
and
virtue
of
a
large
purchase
of
tea
and
the
beverage
was
all
smoking
before
him
my
vig
exclaimed
he
holding
out
his
hand
who
have
thought
of
seeing
you
in
the
city
this
is
something
unkimmon
however
you
werry
welcome
in
botolph
lane
and
as
this
is
your
first
wisit
why
i
make
you
a
present
of
some
tea
wot
do
you
drink
black
or
green
or
perhaps
both
four
pounds
of
one
and
two
of
here
joe
summoning
his
foreman
put
up
four
pounds
of
that
last
lot
of
black
that
came
in
and
two
pounds
of
superior
green
and
this
gentleman
will
tell
you
where
to
leave
and
when
do
you
think
of
starting
again
addressing
the
yorkshireman
egad
this
is
fine
weather
for
the
country
have
half
a
mind
to
have
a
jaunt
myself
makes
one
quite
young
feel
as
if
i
laid
full
fifty
years
aside
and
were
again
a
boy
when
did
you
say
you
start
why
i
do
know
exactly
replied
the
yorkshireman
the
weather
so
fine
that
i
half
tempted
to
go
round
by
newmarket
newmarket
exclaimed
jorrocks
throwing
his
arm
in
the
air
while
his
paper
cap
fell
from
his
head
with
the
jerk
by
newmarket
why
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
impure
have
you
to
do
at
newmarket
why
nothing
in
particular
only
when
there
neither
hunting
nor
shooting
going
on
what
is
a
man
to
do
with
himself
i
sure
despise
me
if
i
were
to
go
fishing
true
observed
jorrocks
somewhat
subdued
and
jingling
the
silver
in
his
is
indeed
the
prince
of
sports
the
image
of
war
without
its
guilt
and
only
half
its
danger
i
confess
that
i
a
martyr
to
it
a
perfect
wictim
no
one
knows
wot
i
suffer
from
my
if
ever
i
wisited
with
the
last
infirmity
of
noble
minds
it
will
be
caused
by
my
ingovernable
passion
for
the
chase
the
sight
of
a
saddle
makes
me
sweat
an
makes
me
perfectly
wild
a
red
coat
throws
me
into
a
scarlet
fever
never
throughout
life
have
i
had
a
good
night
rest
before
an
morning
but
werry
little
racing
does
for
me
wells
is
well
enough
of
a
fine
summer
evening
especially
when
they
plump
the
clown
over
head
in
the
new
river
cut
and
the
ponies
misbehave
in
the
circus
but
oh
newmarket
a
dreadful
place
the
werry
name
a
sickener
i
used
to
hear
a
vast
about
it
from
poor
will
softly
of
friday
street
it
was
the
ruin
of
him
and
wot
a
fine
business
his
father
left
him
both
wholesale
and
retail
in
the
tripe
and
line
all
went
in
two
years
and
he
had
nothing
to
show
at
the
end
of
that
time
for
upwards
of
twenty
thousand
golden
sovereigns
but
a
hundredweight
of
children
socks
and
warrants
for
thirteen
hogsheads
of
damaged
sherry
in
the
docks
no
take
my
adwice
and
have
nothing
to
say
to
them
stay
where
you
are
or
if
you
short
of
swag
come
to
great
coram
street
where
you
shall
have
a
bed
for
your
teeth
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
found
you
and
if
a
fine
day
i
treat
you
with
a
jaunt
to
margate
you
are
a
regular
old
trump
said
the
yorkshireman
after
listening
attentively
until
jorrocks
had
exhausted
himself
but
you
see
you
never
been
at
newmarket
and
the
people
have
been
hoaxing
you
about
it
i
can
assure
you
from
personal
experience
that
the
people
there
are
quite
as
honest
as
those
you
meet
every
day
on
besides
which
there
is
nothing
more
invigorating
to
the
human
frame
nothing
more
cheering
to
the
spirits
than
the
sight
and
air
of
newmarket
heath
on
a
fine
fresh
spring
morning
like
the
present
the
wind
seems
to
go
by
you
at
a
racing
pace
and
the
blood
canters
up
and
down
the
veins
with
the
finest
and
freest
action
imaginable
a
stranger
to
the
would
feel
and
almost
instinctively
know
what
turf
he
was
treading
and
the
purpose
for
which
that
turf
was
intended
there
a
magic
in
the
web
of
it
oh
i
knows
you
are
a
most
persuasive
cock
observed
jorrocks
interrupting
the
yorkshireman
and
would
conwince
the
devil
himself
that
black
is
white
but
you
never
make
me
believe
the
newmarket
folks
are
honest
and
as
to
the
fine
hair
air
you
talk
of
quite
as
good
to
get
on
hampstead
heath
and
if
it
does
make
the
blood
canter
up
and
down
your
weins
you
can
always
amuse
yourself
by
watching
the
donkeys
cantering
up
and
down
with
the
sweet
little
children
haw
haw
haw
but
tell
me
what
is
there
at
newmarket
that
should
take
a
man
there
what
is
there
rejoined
the
yorkshireman
why
there
everything
that
makes
life
desirable
and
constitutes
happiness
in
this
world
except
hunting
first
there
is
the
beautiful
neat
clean
town
with
groups
of
booted
professors
ready
for
the
rapidest
march
of
intellect
then
there
are
the
strings
of
clothed
horses
the
finest
in
the
world
passing
indolently
at
intervals
to
their
exercise
the
flower
of
the
english
aristocracy
residing
in
the
place
you
leave
the
town
and
stroll
to
the
wide
open
heath
where
all
is
brightness
and
space
the
white
rails
stand
forth
against
the
dear
blue
sky
the
brushing
gallop
ever
and
anon
startles
the
ear
and
eye
crowds
of
stable
urchins
full
of
silent
importance
stud
the
heath
you
feel
elated
and
long
to
bound
over
the
well
groomed
turf
and
to
try
the
speed
of
the
careering
wind
all
things
at
newmarket
train
the
mind
to
racing
life
seems
on
the
start
and
dull
indeed
were
he
who
could
rein
in
his
feelings
when
such
inspiring
objects
meet
together
to
madden
them
bravo
exclaimed
jorrocks
throwing
his
paper
cap
in
the
air
as
the
yorkshireman
bravo
werry
good
indeed
you
speak
like
ten
lord
mayors
never
heard
nothing
better
dash
my
vig
if
i
wo
go
by
jove
you
done
it
tell
me
one
thing
is
there
a
good
place
to
feed
at
capital
replied
the
yorkshireman
beef
mutton
cheese
ham
all
the
delicacies
of
the
season
as
the
sailor
said
and
thereupon
the
yorkshireman
and
jorrocks
shook
hands
upon
the
bargain
sunday
night
arrived
and
with
it
arrived
at
the
belle
sauvage
in
ludgate
hill
jorrocks
boy
binjimin
with
and
shortly
after
jorrocks
on
his
chestnut
hunter
and
the
yorkshireman
in
a
hack
cab
entered
the
yard
having
consigned
his
horse
to
binjimin
after
giving
him
a
very
instructive
lesson
relative
to
the
manner
in
which
he
would
chastise
him
if
he
heard
of
his
trotting
or
playing
any
tricks
with
the
horse
on
his
way
home
jorrocks
proceeded
to
pay
the
remainder
of
his
fare
in
the
coach
office
the
mail
was
full
inside
and
out
indeed
the
assured
him
he
could
have
filled
a
dozen
more
so
anxious
ware
all
london

inquired
a
tall
foreigner
with
immense
moustache
a
high
conical
hat
with
a
bright
buckle
long
loose
very
short
white
waistcoat
baggy
brownish

and

said
he
repeating
the
query
as
he
entered
the
office
and
deposited
a
silk
umbrella
a
camlet
cloak
and
a
swiss
knapsack
on
the
counter
the
porter
without
any
attempt
at
an
answer
took
his
goods
and
walked
off
to
the
mail
followed
closely
by
the
baron
and
after
depositing
the
cloak
inside
so
that
the
baron
might
ride
with
his
face
to
the
horses
as
the
saying
is
he
turned
the
knapsack
into
the
hind
boot
and
swung
himself
into
the
office
till
it
was
time
to
ask
for
something
for
his
exertions
meanwhile
the
baron
made
a
tour
of
the
yard
taking
a
lesson
in
english
from
the
lettering
on
the
various
coaches
when
on
the
hind
boot
of
one
he
deciphered
the
word
ah
cheapside
said
he
pulling
out
his
dictionary
and
turning
to
the
letter

he
stamping
and
knitting
his
brows
nom

and
the
first
word
being
drawn
out
to
its
usual
longitude
three
strides
brought
him
and
the
conclusion
of
the
oath
into
the
office
together
he
then
opened
out
upon
the
in
a
tremendous
volley
of
french
english
and
hanoverian
oaths
for
he
was
a
cross
between
the
first
and
last
named
countries
the
purport
of
which
was
dat
he
had
paid
de
best
price
and
he
be
dem
if
he
vod
ride
on
de
cheapside
of
de
coach
in
vain
the
clerks
and
tried
to
convince
him
he
was
wrong
in
his
interpretation
with
the
full
conviction
of
a
foreigner
that
he
was
about
to
be
cheated
he
had
his
cloak
shifted
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
coach
and
the
knapsack
placed
on
the
roof
the
fourth
inside
having
cast
up
the
outside
passengers
mounted
the
insides
took
their
places
and
sixpences
were
pulled
out
for
the
porters
the
guard
twanged
his
horn
the
coachman
turned
out
his
elbow
flourished
his
whip
caught
the
point
cried
all
right
sit
tight
and
trotted
out
of
the
yard
jorrocks
and
the
yorkshireman
sat
opposite
each
other
the
baron
and
old
sam
spring
the
betting
man
did
likewise
who
does
know
old
sam
with
his
curious
spectacles
his
old
drab
hat
turned
up
with
green
careless
neckcloth
flowing
robe
and
comical
cut
he
knew
jorrocks
though
tell
it
not
in
coram
street
he
did
know
his
name
but
concluded
from
the
disparity
of
age
between
him
and
his
companion
that
jorrocks
was
either
a
shark
or
a
shark
jackal
and
the
yorkshireman
a
victim
with
due
professional
delicacy
he
contented
himself
with
scrutinising
the
latter
through
his
specs
the
choler
having
subsided
he
was
the
first
to
break
the
ice
of
silence
foine
noight
was
the
observation
which
was
thrown
out
promiscuously
to
see
who
would
take
it
up
now
sam
spring
though
he
came
late
had
learned
from
the
porter
that
there
was
a
baron
in
the
coach
and
being
a
great
admirer
of
the
nobility
for
whose
use
he
has
a
code
of
signals
of
his
own
consisting
of
one
finger
to
his
hat
for
a
baron
lord
as
he
calls
them
two
for
a
viscount
three
for
an
earl
four
for
a
marquis
and
the
whole
hand
for
a
duke
he
immediately
responded
with
yes
my
lord
with
a
to
his
hat
there
is
something
sweet
in
the
word
lord
which
finds
its
way
home
to
the
heart
of
an
englishman
no
sooner
did
sam
pronounce
it
than
the
baron
became
transformed
in
jorrocks
eyes
into
a
very
superior
sort
of
person
and
forthwith
he
commences
ingratiating
himself
by
offering
him
a
share
of
a
large
paper
of
sandwiches
which
the
baron
accepted
with
the
greatest
condescension
eating
what
he
could
and
stuffing
the
remainder
into
his
hat
his
lordship
was
a
better
hand
at
eating
than
speaking
and
the
united
efforts
of
the
party
could
not
extract
from
him
the
precise
purport
of
his
journey
sam
threw
out
two
or
three
feasible
offers
in
the
way
of
bets
but
they
fell
to
the
bottom
of
the
coach
and
jorrocks
talked
to
him
about
hunting
and
had
the
conversation
all
to
himself
the
baron
merely
replying
with
a
bow
and
a
stare
sometimes
diversified
with
or
i
tank
you
vare
good
the
conversation
by
degrees
resolved
itself
into
a
snore
in
which
they
were
all
indulging
when
the
raw
morning
air
rushed
in
among
them
as
a
porter
with
a
lanthorn
opened
the
door
and
announced
their
arrival
at
newmarket
forthwith
they
turned
into
the
street
and
the
outside
passengers
having
descended
they
all
commenced
straddling
yawning
and
stretching
their
limbs
while
the
guard
and
porters
sorted
their
luggage
the
yorkshireman
having
an
eye
to
a
bed
speedily
had
jorrocks
luggage
and
his
own
on
the
back
of
a
porter
on
its
way
to
the
rutland
arms
while
that
worthy
citizen
followed
in
a
sort
of
sleepy
astonishment
at
the
smallness
of
the
place
inquiring
if
they
were
sure
they
had
not
stopped
at
some
village
by
mistake
two
beds
had
been
ordered
for
two
gentlemen
who
could
not
get
two
seats
by
the
mail
which
fell
to
the
lot
of
those
who
did
and
into
these
our
heroes
trundled
having
arranged
to
be
called
by
the
early
exercising
hour
whether
it
was
from
want
of
his
usual
of
brandy
and
water
or
the
fatigues
of
travelling
or
what
else
remains
unknown
but
no
sooner
was
jorrocks
left
alone
with
his
candle
than
all
at
once
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
fit
of
trepidation
on
thinking
that
he
should
have
been
inveigled
to
such
a
place
as
newmarket
and
the
tremor
increasing
as
he
pulled
four
out
of
his
besides
a
vast
of
silver
and
his
great
gold
watch
he
was
resolved
should
an
attempt
be
made
upon
his
property
to
defend
it
with
his
life
and
having
squeezed
the
notes
into
the
toe
of
his
boots
and
hid
the
silver
in
the
stand
he
very
deliberately
put
his
watch
and
the
poker
under
the
pillow
and
set
the
heavy
chest
of
drawers
with
two
stout
chairs
and
a
table
against
the
door
after
all
which
exertions
he
got
into
bed
and
very
soon
fell
sound
asleep
most
of
the
inmates
of
the
house
were
up
with
the
lark
to
the
early
exercises
and
the
yorkshireman
was
as
early
as
any
of
them
having
found
jorrocks
door
he
commenced
a
loud
battery
against
it
without
awaking
the
grocer
he
then
tried
to
open
it
but
only
succeeded
in
getting
it
an
inch
or
two
from
the
post
and
after
several
holloas
of
jorrocks
my
man
jorrocks
jorrocks
old
boy
holloa
jorrocks
he
succeeded
in
extracting
the
word
wot
from
the
worthy
gentleman
as
he
rolled
over
in
his
bed
jorrocks
repeated
the
yorkshireman
time
to
be
up
wot
again
was
the
answer
time
to
get
up
the
morning
breaking
let
it
break
replied
he
adding
in
a
mutter
as
he
turned
over
again
it
owes
me
nothing
entreaties
being
useless
and
a
large
party
being
on
the
point
of
setting
off
the
yorkshireman
joined
them
and
spent
a
couple
of
hours
on
the
heath
during
which
time
they
not
only
criticised
the
figure
and
action
of
every
horse
that
was
out
but
got
up
tremendous
appetites
for
breakfast
in
the
meantime
jorrocks
had
risen
and
having
attired
himself
with
his
usual
care
in
a
smart
blue
coat
with
metal
buttons
buff
waistcoat
blue
tights
and
hessian
boots
he
turned
into
the
main
street
of
newmarket
where
he
was
lost
in
astonishment
at
the
insignificance
of
the
place
but
wiser
men
than
jorrocks
have
been
similarly
disappointed
for
it
enters
into
the
philosophy
of
few
to
conceive
the
fame
and
grandeur
of
newmarket
compressed
into
the
limits
of
the
petty
outlandish
icelandish
place
that
bears
the
name
dash
my
vig
said
jorrocks
as
he
brought
himself
to
bear
upon
rogers
this
is
the
werry
meanest
town
i
ever
did
see
pray
sir
addressing
himself
to
a
man
in
a
brown
coat
drab
shorts
and
continuations
who
had
just
emerged
from
the
shop
with
a
race
list
in
his
hand
pray
sir
be
this
your
principal
street
the
man
eyed
him
with
a
mixed
look
of
incredulity
and
contempt
at
length
putting
his
thumbs
into
the
of
his
waistcoat
he
replied
i
bet
a
crown
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
done
said
jorrocks
holding
out
his
hand
no
i
wo
do
that
replied
the
man
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
with
you
i
lay
you
two
to
one
in
fives
or
fifties
if
you
like
that
you
knew
before
you
axed
and
that
thunderbolt

win
the
riddlesworth
really
said
jorrocks
i
not
a
betting
man
then
wot
the
business
have
you
at
newmarket
was
all
the
answer
he
got
disgusted
with
such
inhospitable
impertinence
jorrocks
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
before
the
white
hart
inn
was
a
smartish
pony
phaeton
in
charge
of
a
stunted
stable
lad
i
say
young
chap
inquired
jorrocks
whose
is
that
how
did
you
know
that
i
was
a
young
chap
inquired
the
abortion
turning
round
guessed
it
replied
jorrocks
chuckling
at
his
own
wit
then
guess
whose
it
is
pray
are
your
clocks
here
by
london
time
he
asked
of
a
respectable
man
whom
he
saw
turn
out
of
the
entry
leading
to
the
kingston
rooms
and
take
the
usual
survey
first
up
the
town
and
then
down
it
and
afterwards
compose
his
hands
in
his
there
to
stand
to
see
the
world
come
now
old
none
o
your
tricks
here
you
got
a
match
on
against
time
i
suppose
was
all
the
answer
he
could
get
after
the
man
old
r
n
the
had
surveyed
him
from
head
to
foot
footnote
newmarket
or
london
it
all
the
same
the
world
is
but
composed
of
one
own
acquaintance
we
need
hardly
say
after
all
these
rebuffs
that
when
jorrocks
met
the
yorkshireman
he
was
not
in
the
best
possible
humour
indeed
to
say
nothing
of
the
extreme
sharpness
and
suspicion
of
the
people
we
know
of
no
place
where
a
man
not
fond
of
racing
is
so
completely
out
of
his
element
as
at
newmarket
for
with
the
exception
of
a
little
elbow
shaking
in
the
evening
there
is
literally
and
truly
nothing
else
to
do
it
is
heath
ditch
in
abingdon
mile
stakes
sweepstakes
handicaps
bet
lay
take
odds
evens
morning
noon
and
night
jorrocks
made
bitter
complaints
during
the
breakfast
and
some
invidious
comparisons
between
racing
men
and
which
however
became
softer
towards
the
close
as
he
got
deeper
in
the
delicacy
of
a
fine
cambridge
brawn
nature
being
at
length
appeased
he
again
thought
of
turning
out
to
have
a
look
as
he
said
at
the
shows
on
the
course
but
the
appearance
of
his
friend
the
baron
opposite
the
window
put
it
out
of
his
head
and
he
sallied
forth
to
join
him
the
baron
was
evidently
incog
for
he
had
on
the
same
short
waistcoat
chinese
boots
and
conical
hat
that
he
travelled
down
in
and
being
a
stranger
in
the
land
of
course
he
was
uncommonly
glad
to
pick
up
jorrocks
so
after
he
had
hugged
him
a
little
called
him
a
bon
garçon
and
a
few
other
endearing
terms
he
run
his
great
long
arm
through
his
and
walked
him
down
street
the
whole
peregrinations
of
newmarket
being
comprised
in
the
words
up
street
and
down
he
then
communicated
in
most
unrepresentable
language
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
buy
an
and
jorrocks
informing
him
that
he
was
a
perfect
connoisseur
in
the
article
the
baron
again
assured
him
of
his
distinguished
consideration
they
were
met
by
joe
rogers
the
trainer
with
a
in
his
hand
who
led
the
way
to
the
stable
and
having
unlocked
a
box
in
which
was
a
fine
slapping
old
according
to
etiquette
he
put
his
hat
in
a
corner
took
a
switch
in
one
hand
laid
hold
of
the
horse
head
with
the
other
while
the
lad
in
attendance
stripped
off
its
clothes
the
baron
then
turned
up
his
wrists
and
making
a
curious
noise
in
his
throat
proceeded
to
pass
his
hand
down
each
leg
and
along
its
back
after
which
he
gave
it
a
thump
in
the
belly
and
squeezed
its
throat
when
being
as
wise
as
he
was
at
starting
he
stuck
his
thumb
in
his
side
and
took
a
mental
survey
of
the
ah
said
he
at
length
foin
foin
vot
ears
he
has
oh
said
rogers
they
show
breeding
non
non
i
say

he
has
well
but

carries
them

the
answer
non
non
stamping
i
say

years
he
has
oh
hang
it
i
twig
four
years
old
then
the
baron
took
another
long
look
at
him
at
length
he
resumed
i
vill
my
wet
what
that
inquired
rogers
of
jorrocks
his
wet
why
a
drink
to
be
sure
and
thereupon
rogers
went
to
the
pump
and
brought
a
glass
of
pure
water
which
the
baron
refused
with
becoming
indignation
non
non
said
he
stamping
i
vill
my
wet
rogers
looked
at
jorrocks
and
jorrocks
looked
at
rogers
but
neither
rogers
nor
jorrocks
understood
him
i
vill
my
wet
repeated
the
baron
with
vehemence
he
must
want
some
brandy
in
it
observed
jorrocks
judging
of
the
baron
by
himself
and
thereupon
the
lad
was
sent
for
when
it
arrived
the
baron
dashed
it
out
of
his
hand
with
a
prolonged
adding
i
vill
von
surgeon
the
boy
was
dispatched
for
one
and
on
his
arrival
the
veterinary
surgeon
went
through
the
process
that
the
baron
had
attempted
and
not
being
a
man
of
many
words
he
just
gave
the
baron
a
nod
at
the
end
how
moch
inquked
the
baron
of
rogers
five
hundred
was
the
answer
vot
five
hundred

oh
d
n
it
you
may
take
or
leave
him
just
as
you
like
but
you
wo
get
him
for
less
the
vet
explained
that
the
baron
wished
to
know
whether
it
was
five
hundred
francs
french
or
five
hundred
guineas
english
money
and
being
informed
that
it
was
the
latter
he
gave
his
conical
hat
a
thrust
on
his
brow
and
bolted
out
of
the
box
but
race
hour
approaches
and
people
begin
to
assemble
in
groups
before
the
rooms
while
the
usual
aristocratical
accompaniments
of

dribbling
at
intervals

just
driven
on
in
a
fly
in
short
it
a
brilliant
meeting
besides
four
coronetted
carriages
with
there
are
three
a
thing
that
would
have
been
a
phaeton
if
they
have
let
it
general
grosvenor
that
is
to
say
his
carriage
with
a
dog
upon
it
lady
chesterfield
and
the
hon
anson
in
a
pony
phaeton
with
an
miss
will
have
one
next
meeting
instead
of
the
powdered
footman
tattersall
in
his
double
carriage
driving
without
old
theobald
in
leather
breeches
and
a
buggy
five
bury
butchers
in
a
young
dutch
sam
on
a
pony
richards
on
a
rosinante
and
no
end
of
pedestrians
but
where
is
jorrocks
all
this
time
why
eating
brawn
in
the
rutland
arms
with
his
friend
the
baron
perfectly
unconscious
that
all
these
were
not
the
daily
visables
of
the
place
dash
my
vig
said
he
as
he
bolted
another
half
of
the
round
i
see
no
symptoms
of
a
stir
come
my
lord
do
me
the
honour
to
take
another
glass
of
sherry
his
lordship
was
nothing
loath
so
by
mutual
entreaties
they
finished
the
bottle
besides
a
considerable
quantity
of
porter
a
fine
fat
chestnut
suffolk
punch
cart
mare
fresh
from
the
plough
having
been
considerately
provided
by
the
yorkshireman
for
jorrocks
with
a
cob
for
himself
they
proceeded
to
mount
in
the
yard
when
jorrocks
was
concerned
to
find
that
the
baron
had
nothing
to
carry
him
his
lordship
too
seemed
disconcerted
but
it
was
only
momentary
for
walking
up
to
the
punch
mare
and
resting
his
elbow
on
her
hind
quarter
to
try
if
she
kicked
he
very
coolly
vaulted
up
behind
jorrocks
now
jorrocks
though
proud
of
the
patronage
of
a
lord
did
not
exactly
comprehend
whether
he
was
in
earnest
or
not
but
the
baron
soon
let
him
know
for
thrusting
his
conical
hat
on
his
brow
he
put
his
arm
round
jorrocks
waist
and
gave
the
old
mare
a
touch
in
the
flank
with
the
chinese
boot
crying
out
along
me
brave
along
and
the
owner
of
the
mare
living
at
kentford
she
went
off
at
a
brisk
trot
in
that
direction
while
the
yorkshireman
slipped
down
the
town
unperceived
the
sherry
had
done
its
business
on
them
both
the
baron
and
who
perhaps
was
the
most
cut
of
the
two
chaunted
the
hymn
of
liberty
with
as
much
freedom
as
though
he
were
sitting
in
the
saddle
thus
they
proceeded
laughing
and
singing
until
the
bury
arrested
their
progress
when
it
occurred
to
the
steersman
to
ask
if
they
were
going
right
be
this
the
vay
to
newmarket
races
inquired
jorrocks
of
the
the
man
dived
into
the
small
pocket
of
his
white
apron
for
a
ticket
and
very
coolly
replied
shell
out
old
how
much
said
jorrocks
tuppence
which
having
got
he
said
now
then
you
may
turn
for
the
heath
be
over
yonder
pointing
back
at
least
it
was
there
this
morning
i
know
after
a
volley
of
abuse
for
his
impudence
jorrocks
with
some
difficulty
got
the
old
mare
pulled
round
for
she
had
a
deuced
hard
mouth
of
her
own
and
only
a
plain
snaffle
in
it
at
last
however
with
the
aid
of
a
boy
to
beat
her
with
a
they
got
her
set
again
and
retracing
their
steps
they
trotted
down
street
rose
the
hill
and
entered
the
spacious
flat
of
newmarket
heath
the
races
were
going
forward
on
one
of
the
distant
courses
and
a
slight
insignificant
black
streak
swelling
into
a
sort
of
oblong
for
all
the
world
like
an
overgrown
tadpole
was
all
that
denoted
the
spot
or
interrupted
the
verdant
aspect
of
the
quiet
extensive
plain
jorrocks
was
horrified
having
through
life
pictured
epsom
as
a
mere
drop
in
the
ocean
compared
with
the
countless
multitude
of
newmarket
while
the
baron
who
was
wholly
indifferent
to
the
matter
nearly
had
old
jorrocks
pitched
over
the
mare
head
by
applying
the
which
he
had
got
from
the
boy
to
her
tail
while
jorrocks
was
sitting
loosely
contemplating
the
barrenness
of
the
prospect
the
sherry
was
still
alive
and
being
all
for
fun
he
shuffled
back
into
the
saddle
as
soon
as
the
old
mare
gave
over
kicking
and
giving
a
loud
with
some
minor
hunting
noises
which
were
responded
to
by
the
baron
in
notes
not
capable
of
being
set
to
music
and
aided
by
an
equally
indescribable
accompaniment
from
the
old
mare
at
every
application
of
the
bush
she
went
off
at
score
over
the
springy
turf
and
bore
them
triumphantly
to
the
just
as
the
ring
was
in
course
of
formation
a
fact
which
she
announced
by
a
loud
neigh
on
viewing
her
companion
of
the
plough
as
well
as
by
unpsetting
some
as
she
rushed
through
the
crowd
to
greet
her
great
was
the
hubbub
shouting
swearing
and
laughing
for
though
the
newmarketites
are
familiar
with
most
conveyances
from
a
pair
of
horses
down
to
a
pair
of
shoes
it
had
not
then
fallen
to
their
lot
to
see
two
men
ride
into
the
ring
on
the
same
horse
certainly
not
with
such
a
hat
between
them
as
the
baron
the
gravest
and
weightiest
matters
will
not
long
distract
the
attention
of
a
and
the
laughter
having
subsided
without
jorrocks
or
the
baron
being
in
the
slightest
degree
disconcerted
the
ring
was
again
formed
horses
heads
again
turn
towards
the
post
while
carriages
gigs
and
carts
form
an
outer
circle
a
solemn
silence
ensues
the
legs
are
scanning
the
list
at
length
one

another
pause
and
the
pencils
are
pulled
from
the
the
legs
and
lords
look
at
each
other
but
no
one
likes
to
lead
off
at

galloped

with

the
horses
have
actually
started
and
are
now
visible
in
the
distance
sweeping
over
the
open
heath
apparently
without
guide
or
beacon
the
majority
of
the
ring
rush
to
the
white
judge

and
have
just
time
to
range
themselves
along

rude
stakes

box
and
removal
of
the
old
stakes
and
ropes
to
another
course
on
a
different
part
of
the
heath
which
is
accomplished
by
a
few
ragged
rascals
as
rude
and
uncouth
as
the
furniture
they
bear
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
same
group
of
anxious
careworn
countenances
are
again
turned
upon
each
other
at
the
as
though
they
had
never
separated
but
see
the
noble
owner
of
trick
by

is
in
the
crowd
and
jem
bland
eyeing
him
like
a
hawk
i

i

do
you

i
would
have
done
such
a
thing
for
the
world
no
not
even
to
have
been
made
a
markiss
a
follows
this
denunciation
at
which
the
newly
created
marquis
bites
his
livid
lips
footnote
no
judge
ever
gave
a
race
as
won
by
half
a
head
but
we
let
the
whole
passage
stand
as
originally
editor
the
baron
who
appears
to
have
no
taste
for
walking
still
sticks
to
the
punch
mare
which
jorrocks
steers
to
the
newly
formed
ring
aided
by
the
baron
and
the
here
they
come
upon
sam
spring
whose
boy
has
just
brought
his
to
bear
upon
the
ring
formed
by
the
horsemen
and
thinking
it
a
pity
a
nobleman
of
any
county
should
be
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
riding
double
very
politely
offers
to
take
one
into
his
carriage
jorrocks
accepts
the
offer
and
forthwith
proceeds
to
make
himself
quite
at
home
in
it
the
chorus
again
commences
and
jorrocks
interrogates
sam
as
to
the
names
of
the
brawlers
who
be
that
said
he
offering
to
bet
a
thousand
to
a
hundred
spring
after
eyeing
him
through
his
spectacles
with
a
grin
and
a
look
of
suspicion
replies
come
now
come
let
have
no
nonsense
you
know
as
well
as
i
really
replies
jorrocks
most
earnestly
i
do
why
where
have
you
lived
all
your
life
first
part
of
it
with
my
grandmother
at
lisson
grove
afterwards
at
camberwell
but
now
i
resides
in
great
coram
street
russell
square
a
werry
fashionable
neighbourhood
oh
i
see
replies
sam
you
are
one
of
the
city
coves
then
now
what
brings
you
here
just
to
say
that
i
have
been
at
newmarket
for
i
blowed
if
ever
you
catch
me
here
again
that
a
pity
replied
sam
for
you
look
like
a
promising
man
a
chap
in
the
face
do
you
sport
any
o
a
vast
regularly
i
a
member
of
the
surrey
capital
one
it
is
too
best
in
england
by
far
what
do
you
hunt
inquired
sam
foxes
to
be
sure
and
are
they
good
eating
come
replied
jorrocks
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
we
do
eat
the
dialogue
was
interrupted
by
someone
calling
to
sam
to
know
what
he
was
backing
the
bedlamite
colt
my
lord
with
a
forefinger
to
his
hat
that
inquired
jorrocks
that
my
lord
l
a
and
a
very
nice
one
best
i
know
always
bets
with
me
another
next
him
and
the
man
next
him
is
a
a
stage
below
a
something
between
a
nobleman
and
a
gentleman
and
who
be
that
stout
man
in
a
blue
coat
and
velvet
collar
next
him
just
rubbing
his
chin
with
the
race
card
he
be
a
lord
too
i
suppose
no
that
gully
as
honest
a
man
as
ever
came
here
that
crockford
before
him
the
man
on
the
right
is
c
who
they
call
the
because
formerly
he
was
a
professional
housebreaker
but
he
has
given
up
that
trade
and
turned
gentleman
bets
and
keeps
a
this
little
ugly
chap
that
looks
for
all
the
world
like
a
bilious
scotch
terrier
has
lately
come
among
us
he
was
a
tramping
pedlar
sold
worsted
stockings
attended
country
courses
and
occasionally
bet
a
pair
now
he
bets
thousands
of
pounds
and
keeps
racehorses
the
chaps
about
him
all
covered
with
chains
and
rings
and
brooches
were
in
the
duffing
line
sold
brimstoned
sparrows
for
norwich
shawls
for
real
cashmere
and
dried
for
cigars
now
each
has
a
house
horses
and
carriages
and
a
among
them
yon
chap
with
the
extravagantly
big
mouth
is
a
at
cambridge
bet
you
a
thousand
pounds
as
soon
as
look
at
you
the
chap
on
the
right
of
the
post
with
the
red
tie
is
the
son
of
an
ostler
he
commenced
betting
thousands
with
a
farthing
capital
the
man
next
him
all
teeth
and
hair
like
a
dog
is
an
honourable
by
birth
but
not
very
honourable
in
his
nature
but
see
cried
jorrocks
lord
is
talking
to
the
cracksman
to
be
sure
replies
sam
that
the
beauty
of
the
turf
the
lord
and
the
leg
are
reduced
to
an
equality
take
my
word
for
it
if
you
have
a

should
come
upon

the
stout
jolly
portly
jerry
hawthorn
fills
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
the
just
as
the
waiters
are
removing
the
covers
in
stalks
the
baron
in
his
conical
hat
and
reconnoitres
the
viands
sam
all
politeness
invites
him
to
join
the
party
i
tank
you
replies
the
baron
but
i
have
my
wet
in
de
next
room
but
bring
your
wet
with
you
rejoins
sam
all
have
our
wet
together
after
dinner
thinking
the
baron
meant
his
wine
the
usual
inn
grace
for
what
we
are
going
to
receive
the
host
expects
to
be
paid
having
been
said
with
great
feeling
and
earnestness
they
all
set
to
at
the
victuals
and
little
conversation
passed
until
the
removal
of
the
cloth
when
badchild
calling
upon
his
vice
observed
that
as
in
all
probability
there
were
gentlemen
of
different
political
and
other
opinions
present
perhaps
the
best
way
would
be
to
give
a
comprehensive
toast
and
so
get
over
any
debatable
ground
he
therefore
proposed
to
drink
in
a
bumper
the
king
the
queen
and
all
the
royal
family
the
ministry
particularly
the
master
of
the
horse
the
army
the
navy
the
church
the
state
and
after
the
excellent
dinner
they
had
eaten
he
would
include
the
name
of
the
landlord
of
the
white
hart
great
applause
song
from
jerry
hawthorn
the
king
of
the
cannibal
islands
the
chairman
then
called
upon
the
company
to
fill
their
glasses
to
a
toast
upon
which
there
could
be
no
difference
of
opinion
it
was
a
sport
which
they
all
enjoyed
one
that
was
delightful
to
the
old
and
to
the
young
to
the
peer
and
to
the
peasant
and
open
to
all
whatever
might
be
the
merits
of
other
amusements
he
had
never
yet
met
any
man
with
the
hardihood
to
deny
that
racing
was
at
once
the
noblest
and
the
most
legitimate
loud
cheers
and
thumps
on
the
table
that
set
all
the
glasses
dancing
not
only
was
it
the
noblest
and
most
legitimate
but
it
was
the
most
profitable
and
where
was
the
man
of
high
and
honourable
principle
who
did
not
feel
when
breathing
the
pure
atmosphere
of
that
heath
a
lofty
at
the
thought
that
though
he
might
have
left
those
who
were
near
and
dear
to
him
in
a
less
genial
atmosphere
still
he
was
not
selfishly
enjoying
himself
without
a
thought
for
their
welfare
for
racing
while
it
brought
health
and
vigour
to
the
father
also
brought
what
was
dearer
to
the
mind
of
a
parent
the
means
of
promoting
the
happiness
and
prosperity
of
his
family
immense
cheers
with
these
few
observations
he
should
simply
propose
turf
and
may
we
long
be
above
it
applause
and
on
the
motion
of
spring
three
cheers
for
badchild
and
all
the
little
badchildren
were
called
for
and
given
when
the
noise
had
subsided
jorrocks
very
deliberately
got
up
amid
whispers
and
inquiries
as
to
who
he
was
gentlemen
said
he
with
an
indignant
stare
and
a
thump
on
the
table
gentlemen
i
say
in
much
of
what
has
fallen
from
our
worthy
chairman
i
save
in
what
he
says
about
racing
i
insists
that
is
the
sport
of
sports
immense
laughter
and
cries
of
wot
an
old
fool
gentlemen
may
laugh
but
i
say
it
a
fact
and
though
i
does
wish
to
create
no
displeasancy
whatsomever
yet
i
should
despise
myself
most
confoundedly
should
consider
myself
unworthy
of
the
great
and
distinguished
to
which
i
have
the
honour
to
belong
if
i
sat
quietly
down
without
sticking
up
for
the
chase
laughter
i
say
it
one
of
the
balances
of
the
constitution
laughter
i
say
it
the
sport
of
kings
the
image
of
war
without
its
guilt
hisses
and
immense
laughter
he
would
fearlessly
propose
a
bumper
toast
he
would
give
them
there
was
some
demur
about
drinking
it
but
on
the
interposition
of
sam
spring
who
assured
the
company
that
jorrocks
was
one
of
the
right
sort
and
with
an
addition
proposed
by
jerry
hawthorn
which
made
the
toast
more
comprehensible
they
swallowed
it
and
the
chairman
followed
it
up
with
the
sod
which
was
drunk
with
great
applause
cox
of
blue
hammerton
returned
thanks
he
considered
the
finest
of
all
fine
amusements
nothing
could
equal
the
rush
between
two
prime
that
was
his
colour
the
chairman
had
said
a
vast
for
racing
and
to
cut
the
matter
short
he
might
observe
that
combined
all
the
advantages
of
making
money
with
the
additional
benefit
of
not
being
interfered
with
by
the
weather
he
begged
to
return
his
best
thanks
for
himself
and
brother
sods
and
only
regretted
he
had
not
been
taught
speaking
in
his
youth
or
he
would
certainly
have
convinced
them
all
that
was
the
sport
coursing
was
the
next
toast
for
which
arthur
pavis
the
jockey
returned
thanks
he
was
very
fond
of
the
dogs
and
thought
after
racing
coursing
was
the
true
thing
he
was
no
orator
and
so
he
drank
off
his
wine
to
the
health
of
the
company
steeplechasing
followed
for
which
coalman
of
albans
returned
thanks
assuring
the
company
that
it
answered
his
purpose
remarkably
well
then
the
vice
gave
the
chair
and
the
chair
gave
the
vice
and
by
way
of
a
finale
badchild
proposed
the
game
of
observing
in
a
whisper
to
jorrocks
that
perhaps
he
would
like
to
subscribe
to
a
purse
for
the
purpose
of
going
to
hell
to
which
jorrocks
with
great
gravity
replied
sir
i
d
d
if
i
do
vi
a
week
at
cheltenham
the
cheltenham
dandy
jorrocks
had
been
very
poorly
indeed
of
indigestion
as
he
calls
it
produced
by
tucking
in
too
much
roast
beef
and
plum
pudding
at
christmas
and
prolonging
the
period
of
his
festivities
a
little
beyond
the
season
allowed
by
moore
and
having
in
vain
applied
the
usual
remedies
prescribed
on
such
occasions
he
at
length
consented
to
try
the
cheltenham
waters
though
altogether
opposed
to
the
element
he
not
having
astonished
his
stomach
as
he
says
for
the
last
fifteen
years
with
a
glass
of
water
having
established
himself
and
the
yorkshireman
in
a
small
private
lodging
in
high
street
consisting
of
two
bedrooms
and
a
he
commenced
his
visits
to
the
royal
spa
and
after
a
few
good
drenches
picked
up
so
rapidly
that
to
whatever
inn
they
went
to
dine
the
landlords
and
waiters
were
astounded
at
the
consumption
of
prog
and
in
a
very
short
time
he
was
known
from
the
royal
hotel
down
to
commercial
inn
as
the
great
london
cormorant
at
first
however
he
was
extremely
depressed
in
spirits
and
did
nothing
the
whole
day
after
his
arrival
but
talk
about
the
arrangement
of
his
temporal
affairs
and
the
first
symptom
he
gave
of
returning
health
was
one
day
at
dinner
at
the
plough
by
astonishing
two
or
three
swells
who
as
usual
were
disporting
themselves
in
the
by
bellowing
to
the
waiter
for
some
sarce
to
his
fish
before
this
he
had
never
once
spoken
of
his
favourite
diversion
and
the
sportsmen
cantered
by
the
window
to
cover
in
the
morning
and
back
in
the
afternoon
without
eliciting
a
single
observation
from
him
the
morning
after
this
change
for
the
better
he
addressed
his
companion
at
breakfast
as
follows
blow
me
tight
york
if
i
ar
regularly
renowated
i
as
fresh
as
an
old
hat
after
a
shower
of
rain
i
really
thinks
i
shall
get
over
this
terrible
illness
for
i
dreamt
of
last
night
and
if
you
a
mind
we
go
and
see
my
lord
segrave
reynard
dog
and
then
start
from
this
corrupt
place
for
you
see
it
nothing
but
a
town
and
what
the
use
of
sticking
oneself
in
a
little
pokey
lodging
like
this
where
there
really
is
not
room
to
swing
a
cat
and
paying
the
deuce
knows
how
much
tin
too
when
one
has
a
splendid
house
in
great
coram
street
going
on
all
the
time
with
a
rigler
establishment
of
servants
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
now
you
knows
i
does
grudge
a
wisit
to
margate
though
that
a
town
too
but
then
you
see
one
has
the
sea
to
look
at
whereas
here
it
nothing
but
a
long
street
with
shops
not
so
good
as
those
in
red
lion
street
with
a
few
small
streets
branching
off
from
it
and
as
to
the
prommenard
as
they
calls
it
aside
the
spa
with
its
trees
and
garden
stuff
why
i
sure
to
my
mind
the
clarence
gardens
up
by
the
regent
park
are
quite
as
fine
it
true
the
doctor
says
i
must
remain
another
fortnight
to
perfect
the
cure
but
then
them
or
whatever
you
calls
them
are
such
rum
jockeys
and
i
always
thinks
they
say
one
word
for
the
patient
and
two
for
themselves
now
my
chap
said
i
must
only
take
half
a
bottle
o
black
strap
a
day
at
the
werry
most
whereas
i
have
never
had
less
than
a
whole
one
his
half
first
as
i
say
and
my
own
after
and
because
i
tells
him
i
take
a
pint
he
flatters
himself
his
treatment
is
capital
and
that
he
is
a
wonderful
but
as
a
man
ca
be
better
than
well
i
think
we
just
see
what
there
to
be
seen
in
the
neighbourhood
and
then
cut
our
sticks
and
as
i
said
before
i
should
like
werry
much
to
see
my
lord
segrave
hounds
in
order
that
i
may
judge
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
wide
world
to
be
compared
to
the
surrey
for
if
i
remember
right
nimrod
described
them
as
werry
werry
fine
indeed
having
formed
this
resolution
jorrocks
stamped
on
the
floor
for
the
bell
was
broken
for
the
little
boy
who
did
the
odd
jobs
of
the
house
to
bring
up
his
hessian
boots
into
which
having
thrust
his
great
calves
and
replaced
the
old
brown
which
he
uses
for
a
by
a
superfine
saxony
blue
with
metal
buttons
and
pockets
outside
he
pulled
his
wig
straight
stuck
his
white
hat
with
the
green
flaps
knowingly
on
his
head
and
sallied
forth
for
execution
as
stout
a
man
as
ever
knowing
that
the
kennel
is
near
the
winchcourt
road
they
proceeded
in
that
direction
but
after
walking
about
a
mile
came
upon
a
groom
on
a
chestnut
horse
who
returning
from
the
chase
was
wetting
his
whistle
at
the
appropriate
sign
of
the
fox
and
hounds
and
who
informed
them
that
they
had
passed
the
turning
for
the
kennel
but
that
the
hounds
were
out
and
then
in
a
wood
which
he
pointed
out
on
the
hillside
about
two
miles
off
into
which
they
had
just
brought
their
fox
looking
in
that
direction
they
presently
saw
the
summit
of
one
of
the
highest
of
the
range
of
hills
that
encircle
the
town
of
cheltenham
covered
with
horsemen
and
pedestrians
who
kept
moving
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
mountain
brow
looking
in
the
distance
more
like
a
flock
of
sheep
than
anything
else
jorrocks
being
all
right
again
and
up
to
anything
proposed
a
start
to
the
wood
and
though
he
thought
they
should
hardly
reach
it
before
the
hounds
either
killed
their
fox
or
he
broke
away
again
they
agreed
to
take
the
chance
and
away
they
went
best
leg
first
as
the
saying
is
the
cover
queen
wood
by
name
and
as
jorrocks
found
out
from
somebody
the
property
of
lord
ellenborough
being
much
larger
than
it
at
first
appeared
and
the
fox
but
a
bad
one
they
were
in
lots
of
time
and
having
toiled
to
the
top
of
the
wood
jorrocks
swaggered
in
among
the
horsemen
with
all
the
importance
of
an
alderman
for
full
an
hour
after
they
got
there
the
hounds
kept
running
in
cover
the
fox
being
repeatedly
viewed
and
the
pack
continually
pressing
him
once
or
twice
he
came
out
but
after
skirting
the
edge
a
few
yards
turned
in
again
indeed
there
were
two
foxes
on
foot
one
being
a
one
and
it
was
extraordinary
how
he
went
and
stood
before
hounds
going
apparently
very
cautiously
and
stopping
every
now
and
then
to
listen
at
last
a
thundering
old
fellow
went
away
before
the
whole
field
making
for
the
steep
declivities
that
lead
into
the
downs
and
though
the
brow
of
the
hill
was
covered
with
who
holloa
and
shouted
enough
to
turn
a
lion
he
would
make
his
point
and
only
altering
his
course
so
as
to
avoid
running
right
among
the
mob
he
gained
the
summit
of
the
hill
and
disappeared
this
hill
being
uncommonly
steep
was
a
breather
for
hounds
that
had
been
running
so
long
as
they
had
in
a
thick
cover
too
and
neither
they
nor
the
horses
went
at
it
with
any
great
dash
the
fox
was
not
a
fellow
to
be
caught
very
easily
and
nothing
but
a
good
start
could
have
given
them
any
chance
but
the
hounds
never
got
well
settled
to
the
scent
and
after
a
fruitless
cast
his
lordship
gave
it
up
and
jorrocks
and
trudged
back
to
cheltenham
j
highly
delighted
at
so
favourable
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
hounds
indeed
so
pleased
was
he
with
the
and
the
whole
thing
that
finding
from
skinner
one
of
the
that
they
met
on
the
following
morning
at
purge
in
their
best
country
forgetting
all
about
his
indigestion
and
the
royal
spa
he
went
to
newman
and
longridge
the
horse
dealers
and
livery
stable
keepers
and
engaged
a
couple
of
nags
to
look
at
the
hounds
upon
as
he
impressed
upon
their
minds
which
he
ordered
to
be
ready
at
nine
this
day
he
proposed
to
give
the
landlord
of
the
george
inn
in
the
high
street
the
benefit
of
his
rapacious
appetite
and
about
five
his
latest
london
hour
they
sat
down
to
dinner
the
george
is
neither
exactly
a
swell
house
like
the
royal
hotel
or
the
plough
nor
yet
a
commercial
one
but
something
betwixt
and
between
the
is
very
small
consequently
all
the
frequenters
are
drawn
together
and
if
a
conversation
is
started
a
man
must
be
deuced
unsociable
that
does
not
join
in
the
cry
as
three
or
four
were
sitting
round
the
fire
chatting
over
their
tipple
and
jorrocks
was
telling
some
of
his
best
bouncers
the
door
opened
and
a
waiter
bowed
a
fresh
animal
into
the
cage
who
after
eyeing
the
party
took
off
his
hat
and
forthwith
proceeded
to
pull
off
divers
neckcloths
cloaks
muffitees
until
he
reduced
himself
to
about
half
the
size
he
was
on
entering
he
was
a
little
old
man
with
white
hair
and
plenty
of
it
a
long
stupid
red
face
with
little
pig
eyes
a
very
long
awkward
body
and
very
short
legs
he
was
dressed
in
a
blue
coat
buff
waistcoat
a
sort
of
baggy
grey
or
trousers
over
which
he
had
buttoned
a
pair
of
long
black
gaiters
having
peeled
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
blew
upon
them
as
much
as
to
say
now
gentlemen
wo
you
let
me
have
a
smell
of
the
fire
and
accordingly
by
a
sort
of
military
revolution
they
made
a
place
for
him
right
in
the
centre
coldish
night
i
reckon
sir
said
jorrocks
looking
him
over
very
cold
indeed
very
cold
indeed
answered
he
rubbing
his
elbows
against
his
ribs
and
stamping
with
his
feet
i
just
got
off
the
top
of
the
liverpool
coach
and
i
can
assure
you
it
very
cold
riding
outside
a
coach
all
day
long
however
i
always
say
that
it
better
than
being
inside
though
indeed
it
very
little
that
i
trouble
coaches
at
all
in
the
course
of
the
year
generally
travel
in
my
own
carriage
only
my
family
have
it
with
them
in
bristol
now
where
i
going
to
join
them
but
i
well
used
to
the
elements
hunting
shooting
and
fishing
as
i
do
constantly
this
later
announcement
made
jorrocks
rouse
up
and
finding
himself
in
the
company
of
a
sportsman
and
one
too
who
travelled
in
his
own
carriage
he
assumed
a
different
tone
and
commenced
on
a
fresh
tack
and
pray
may
i
make
bold
to
inquire
what
country
you
hunts
in
sir
said
he
oh
i
live
in
cheshire
mainwaring
country
but
melton
the
place
i
chiefly
hunt
at
know
all
the
fellows
there
rare
set
of
dogs
to
be
sure
only
country
worth
hunting
in
to
my
mind
rigler
swells
though
the
chaps
ar
they
recollect
one
swell
of
a
fellow
coming
with
his
upper
lip
all
over
fur
into
our
country
thinking
to
astonish
our
weak
minds
but
i
reckon
we
told
him
out
what
you
hunt
do
you
a
few
you
perhaps
heard
tell
of
the
surrey
cocktail
affair
is
it
no
such
thing
i
assure
you
cocktail
indeed
i
likes
that
well
but
it
not
what
we
calls
a
i
does
know
wot
you
calls
a
but
if
you
a
mind
to
make
a
match
i
bet
you
a
hat
ay
or
half
a
dozen
hats
that
i
find
a
fellow
to
take
the
conceit
out
o
any
your
meltonians
oh
i
do
doubt
but
you
have
some
good
men
among
you
sure
i
did
mean
anything
offensive
by
asking
if
it
was
a
cocktail
affair
but
we
meltonians
certainly
have
a
trick
i
must
confess
of
running
every
other
country
down
come
sir
i
drink
the
surrey
hunt
with
all
my
heart
said
he
swigging
off
the
remains
of
a
glass
of
which
the
waiter
had
brought
him
shortly
after
entering
thank
you
sir
kindly
waiter
bring
me
a
bottom
o
brandy
cold
without
and
do
stint
for
quantity
if
you
please
does
you
think
these
inns
werry
expensive
places
sir
i
does
mean
this
in
particular
but
inns
in
general
oh
i
do
know
sir
we
must
expect
to
pay
live
and
let
live
is
my
motto
i
always
pay
my
inn
bills
without
looking
them
over
just
cast
my
eyes
at
the
bottom
to
see
the
amount
then
call
for
pen
and
ink
add
so
much
for
waiter
so
much
for
chambermaid
so
much
for
boots
and
if
i
travelling
in
my
own
carriage
so
much
for
the
ostler
for
greasing
that
the
way
i
do
business
sir
well
sir
a
werry
pleasant
plan
too
especially
for
the
innkeeper
and
all
werry
right
for
a
gentleman
of
fortune
like
you
my
motto
however
is
waste
not
want
not
and
my
wife
father
motto
was
wilful
waste
brings
woeful
want
and
i
likes
to
have
my
now
said
he
pulling
out
a
handful
of
bills
at
some
places
that
i
go
to
they
charges
me
six
shillings
a
day
for
my
dinner
and
when
i
was
ill
and
could
digest
nothing
but
the
lightest
and
plainest
of
breakfasts
when
a
fork
breakfast
in
fact
would
have
made
a
stiff
of
me
and
my
muffin
mill
was
almost
stopped
they
charged
me
two
shillings
for
one
cake
and
sixpence
for
two
now
i
in
the
tea
trade
myself
you
must
know
and
i
contend
that
as
things
go
or
at
least
as
things
went
before
the
barbarian
eye
as
they
call
napier
kicked
up
a
row
with
the
hong
merchants
it
altogether
a
shameful
imposition
and
i
wonder
people
put
up
with
it
oh
sir
i
do
know
i
think
that
it
is
the
charge
all
over
the
country
besides
it
does
do
to
look
too
closely
at
these
things
and
you
must
allow
something
for
keeping
up
the
you
know
fire
candles
and
so
on
but
blow
me
tight
you
surely
do
want
a
candle
to
breakfast
by
however
i
contends
that
innkeepers
are
great
fools
for
making
these
sort
of
charges
for
it
makes
people
get
out
of
their
houses
as
quick
as
ever
they
can
whereas
they
might
be
inclined
to
stay
if
they
could
get
things
for
my
part
i
likes
a
but
having
been
used
to
commercial
houses
when
i
travelled
i
knows
what
the
charges
ought
to
be
now
this
room
is
snug
enough
though
small
and
wo
require
no
great
keeping
up
no
but
this
room
is
smaller
than
the
generality
of
them
you
know
they
frequently
have
two
fires
in
them
besides
no
end
of
oil
i
know
the
expense
of
these
things
for
i
have
a
very
large
house
in
the
country
and
rely
upon
it
innkeepers
have
not
such
immense
profits
as
many
people
imagines
but
as
i
said
before
live
and
let
live
so
says
i
live
and
let
live
but
wot
i
complains
of
is
that
some
innkeepers
charge
so
much
that
they
wo
let
people
live
no
man
is
fonder
of
eating
than
myself
but
i
do
like
to
pay
by
the
mouthful
or
yet
to
drink
tea
at
so
much
a
thimbleful
by
the
way
sar
if
you
are
not
previously
engaged
i
should
be
werry
happy
to
supply
you
with
red
mocho
or
best
twankay
at
a
very
reasonable
figure
indeed
for
cash
thank
you
sir
thank
you
those
are
things
i
never
interfere
with
leave
all
these
things
to
my
people
my
housekeeper
sends
me
in
her
book
every
quarter
day
with
an
account
of
what
she
pays
i
just
look
at
the
amount
add
so
much
for
wages
and
write
a
cheque
live
and
let
live
say
i
however
added
he
pulling
out
his
watch
and
ringing
the
bell
for
the
chambermaid
i
hate
to
get
up
very
early
so
i
think
it
is
time
to
go
to
bed
and
i
wish
you
a
very
good
night
gentlemen
all
jorrocks
gets
up
advances
to
the
door
makes
him
one
of
his
most
obsequious
bows
and
wishes
him
a
werry
good
night
having
heard
him
tramp
upstairs
and
safely
deposited
in
his
bedroom
they
pulled
their
chairs
together
again
and
making
a
smaller
circle
round
the
fire
proceeded
to
canvass
their
departed
friend
jorrocks
began
i
say
wot
a
regular
swell
the
chap
is
a
meltonian
i
wonders
who
the
deuce
he
is
wish
nimrod
was
among
us
he
could
tell
us
all
about
him
i
dare
say
i
blowed
if
i
did
take
him
for
a
commercial
gentleman
at
first
until
he
spoke
about
his
carriages
i
likes
to
see
gentlemen
of
fortune
making
themselves
sociable
by
coming
into
the
instead
of
sticking
themselves
up
in
private
as
if
nobody
was
good
enough
for
them
you
know
melton
york
did
you
ever
see
the
gentleman
out
i
ca
say
that
i
ever
did
said
his
friend
but
people
look
so
different
in
their
red
coats
to
what
they
do
in
mufti
that
there
no
such
thing
as
recognising
them
unless
you
had
a
previous
acquaintance
with
them
the
fields
in
leicestershire
are
sometimes
so
large
that
it
requires
a
residence
to
get
anything
like
a
general
knowledge
of
the
hunt
and
you
know
northamptonshire
the
country
for
my
money
after
surrey
of
course
i
do
think
he
is
a
gentleman
observed
a
thin
young
man
who
sitting
on
one
side
of
the
fire
had
watched
the
stranger
very
narrowly
without
joining
in
the
conversation
he
gives
me
more
the
idea
of
a
gentleman
servant
acting
the
part
of
master
than
anything
else
oh
he
is
a
gentleman
i
sure
besides
a
servant
travel
in
a
carriage
you
know
and
he
talked
about
greasing
the
wheels
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
which
showed
he
was
familiar
with
the
thing
that
very
true
replied
the
youth
but
a
servant
may
travel
in
the
rumble
and
pay
for
greasing
the
wheels
all
the
same
or
perhaps
have
to
grease
them
himself
well
i
should
say
he
a
foolish
sort
of
fellow
observed
another
who
has
come
into
money
unexpectedly
and
who
likes
to
be
the
cock
of
his
party
and
show
off
a
little
i
be
bound
to
say
you
all
wrong
you
are
not
you
see
or
you
would
know
that
that
is
a
way
the
sportsmen
have
we
always
make
ourselves
at
home
and
agreeable
have
a
word
for
everybody
in
fact
and
no
reserve
besides
you
see
there
was
nothing
gammonacious
as
i
calls
it
about
his
toggery
no
coats
with
sporting
buttons
or
coaches
and
four
or
foxes
for
pins
in
his
shirt
i
do
care
for
that
replied
the
sallow
youth
dress
him
as
you
will
court
suit
bag
wig
and
sword
you
make
nothing
better
of
him
he
a
snob
jorrocks
getting
up
runs
to
the
table
on
which
the
hats
were
standing
saying
i
wonder
if
he
left
his
castor
behind
him
i
always
found
a
man
hat
will
tell
a
good
deal
this
is
yours
york
with
the
loop
to
it
and
here
mine
i
always
writes
golgotha
in
mine
which
being
interpreted
you
know
means
the
place
of
a
skull
these
are
yours
i
presume
gentlemen
said
he
taking
up
two
others
confound
him
he
taken
his
tile
with
him
however
i
quite
positive
he
a
gentleman
lay
you
a
hat
apiece
all
round
he
is
if
you
like
but
how
are
we
to
prove
it
inquired
the
youth
call
in
the
waiter
he
may
know
nothing
about
him
and
a
waiter
gentleman
is
always
the
man
who
pays
him
most
trust
the
waiter
for
knowing
something
about
him
and
if
he
does
why
it
only
to
send
a
purlite
message
upstairs
saying
that
two
gentlemen
in
the
have
bet
a
trifle
that
he
is
some
nobleman
lord
maryborough
for
instance
he
a
little
chap
but
we
must
make
haste
or
the
gentleman
will
be
asleep
well
then
i
take
your
bet
of
a
hat
replied
the
youth
that
he
is
not
what
i
call
a
gentleman
i
do
know
what
you
calls
a
gentleman
i
lay
you
a
hat
a
guinea
one
either
white
or
black
whichever
you
like
but
none
your
dog
hairs
or
gossamers
mind
that
he
a
man
of
dibs
and
follow
no
trade
or
calling
and
if
that
is
a
gentleman
i
do
know
wot
is
what
say
you
york
suppose
we
put
it
thus
you
bet
this
gentleman
a
hat
that
he
a
meltonian
which
will
comprise
all
the
rest
werry
well
put
do
you
take
me
sir
a
guinea
hat
against
a
guinea
hat
i
do
said
the
youth
then
done
now
ring
the
bell
for
the
waiter
i
pump
him
snuff
them
candles
if
you
please
and
bring
me
another
bottom
o
without
and
waiter
here
pray
who
is
that
gentleman
that
came
in
by
the
liverpool
coach
the
little
gentleman
in
long
black
gaiters
who
sat
in
this
chair
you
know
and
had
some
i
know
who
you
mean
sir
quite
well
the
gentleman
who
gone
to
bed
let
me
see
what
his
name
he
keeps
that
large
hotel
in
street
liverpool
what
the
here
an
immense
burst
of
laughter
drowned
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
jorrocks
rose
in
a
rage
no
you
blockhead
said
he
no
such
thing
you
thinking
of
someone
else
the
gentleman
hunts
at
melton
mowbray
and
travels
in
his
own
carriage
i
do
know
nothing
about
melton
mowbray
sir
but
the
last
time
he
came
through
here
on
his
road
to
bristol
he
was
in
one
of
his
own
yellows
and
had
such
a
load
his
wife
a
nurse
and
eight
children
inside
himself
his
son
and
an
on
the
dickey
that
the
horses
knocked
up
and
say
no
more
say
no
more
d
n
his
teeth
and
and
that
swearing
a
thing
i
never
do
but
on
the
most
outrageous
occasions
confounded
humbug
i
be
upsides
with
him
however
waiter
bring
the
bill
and
no
more
brandy
never
was
so
done
in
all
my
life
a
gammonacious
fellow
there
sir
there
your
one
pound
one
said
he
handing
a
sovereign
and
a
shilling
to
the
winner
of
the
hat
give
me
my
tile
and
let
waiter
i
ca
wait

bring
the
bill
up
to
my
lodgings
in
the
morning
if
it
is
come
away
come
away
i
shall
never
get
over
this
as
long
as
ever
i
live
and
let
live
indeed
no
wonder
he
stuck
up
for
the
innkeepers
a
publican
and
a
sinner
as
he
is
good
night
gentlemen
good
night
vii
aquatics
jorrocks
at
margate
the
shady
side
of
cheapside
had
become
a
luxury
and
footmen
in
red
plush
breeches
objects
of
real
commiseration
when
jorrocks
tired
of
the
heat
and
ungrateful
hurry
of
the
town
resolved
upon
undertaking
an
aquatic
excursion
he
was
sitting
as
is
his
custom
always
in
the
afternoon
in
the
arbour
at
the
farther
end
of
his
gravel
walk
which
he
dignifies
by
the
name
of
garden
and
had
just
finished
a
rough
mental
calculation
as
to
whether
he
could
eat
more
bread
spread
with
jam
or
honey
when
the
idea
of
the
jaunt
entered
his
imagination
being
a
man
of
great
decision
he
speedily
winnowed
the
project
over
in
his
mind
and
producing
a
note
from
the
fob
of
his
small
clothes
passed
it
in
review
between
his
fingers
rubbed
out
the
creases
held
it
up
to
the
light
refolded
and
restored
it
to
his
fob
batsay
cried
he
bring
my
castor
the
white
one
as
hangs
next
the
blue
cloak
and
forthwith
a
white
hat
was
transferred
from
the
peg
to
jorrocks
head
this
done
he
proceeded
to
the
piazza
where
he
found
the
yorkshireman
exercising
himself
up
and
down
the
spacious
and
grasping
his
hand
with
the
firmness
of
a
vice
he
forthwith
began
unburthening
himself
of
the
object
of
his
mission
are
you
said
he
shaking
his
arm
like
the
handle
of
a
pump
are
you
i
say
i
so
delighted
to
see
you
ye
car
think
is
this
charming
weather
it
makes
me
feel
like
a
butterfly
really
think
the
is
sprouting
under
my
vig
here
he
took
off
his
wig
and
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
bald
head
as
though
he
were
feeling
for
the
shoots
now
to
business
j
is
away
at
tooting
as
you
perhaps
knows
and
i
all
alone
in
great
coram
street
with
the
key
of
the
cellar
larder
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
a
werry
great
mind
to
be
off
on
a
jaunt
what
say
you
not
the
slightest
objection
replied
the
yorkshireman
on
the
old
principle
of
you
finding
cash
and
me
finding
company
why
now
i
tell
you
werry
honestly
that
i
should
greatly
prefer
your
paying
your
own
shot
but
however
if
you
a
mind
to
do
as
i
do
i
let
you
stand
in
the
half
of
a
note
and
whatever
silver
i
have
in
my
pocket
pulling
out
a
great
handful
as
he
spoke
and
counting
up
and
sixpence
very
good
replied
the
yorkshireman
when
he
had
finished
i
your
man
and
not
to
be
behindhand
in
point
of
liberality
i
got
threepence
that
i
received
in
change
at
the
cigar
divan
just
now
which
i
will
add
to
the
common
stock
so
that
we
shall
have
six
pounds
twelve
and
ninepence
between
us
between
us
exclaimed
jorrocks
now
that
so
like
a
yorkshireman
i
declare
you
northerns
seem
to
think
all
the
world
are
asleep
except
yourselves
howsomever
i
vo
quarrel
with
you
a
goodish
sort
of
chap
in
your
way
and
so
long
as
i
keep
the
swag
we
car
get
far
wrong
well
then
at
two
we
start
for
margate
the
most
delightful
place
in
all
the
world
where
we
will
have
a
rare
jollification
and
can
stay
just
as
long
as
the
money
holds
out
so
now
i
off
home
again
to
see
about
wittles
for
the
woyage
it
were
almost
superfluous
to
mention
that
the
following
day
was
a
saturday
for
no
discreet
citizen
would
think
of
leaving
town
on
any
other
it
dawned
with
uncommon
splendour
and
the
cocks
of
coram
street
and
adjacent
parts
seemed
to
hail
the
morn
with
more
than
their
wonted
energy
never
save
on
a
hunting
morning
did
jorrocks
tumble
about
in
bed
with
such
restless
anxiety
as
cock
after
cock
took
up
the
crow
in
every
gradation
of
noise
from
the
shrill
note
of
the
free
chanticleer
before
the
door
to
the
faint
response
of
the
cooped
and
prisoned
victims
of
the
neighbouring
poulterer
their
efforts
being
aided
by
the
flutterings
and
impertinent
chirruping
of
swarms
of
sparrows
at
length
the
boy
binjimin
tapped
at
his
master
door
and
depositing
his
can
of
on
his
took
away
his
coat
and
waistcoat
under
pretence
of
brushing
them
but
in
reality
to
feel
if
he
had
left
any
pence
in
the
pockets
with
pleasure
jorrocks
threw
aside
the
and
bounded
upon
the
floor
with
a
bump
that
shook
his
own
and
adjoining
houses
on
this
day
a
few
extra
minutes
were
devoted
to
his
toilet
one
or
two
of
which
were
expended
in
adjusting
a
gold
foxhead
pin
in
a
conspicuous
part
of
his
white
tie
and
in
drawing
on
a
pair
of
new
dark
blue
pantaloons
made
so
excessively
tight
that
at
starting
any
of
his
newmarket
friends
would
have
laid
three
to
two
against
his
ever
getting
into
them
at
all
when
on
however
they
fully
developed
the
substantial
proportions
of
his
limbs
while
his
large
tasselled
hessians
showed
that
the
bootmaker
had
been
instructed
to
make
a
pair
for
a
great
calf
a
blue
coat
with
metal
buttons
ample
laps
and
pockets
outside
with
a
handsome
buff
kerseymere
waistcoat
formed
his
costume
on
this
occasion
breakfast
being
over
he
repaired
to
botolph
lane
there
to
see
his
letters
and
look
after
his
commercial
affairs
in
which
the
reader
not
being
interested
we
will
allow
the
yorkshireman
to
figure
a
little
about
one
this
enterprising
young
man
placed
himself
in
tommy
sly
wherry
at
the
foot
of
the
savoy
stairs
and
not
agreeing
in
opinion
with
jorrocks
that
it
is
of
no
use
keeping
a
dog
and
barking
oneself
he
took
an
oar
and
helped
to
row
himself
down
to
london
bridge
at
the
wharf
below
the
bridge
there
lay
a
magnificent
steamer
painted
and
white
with
flags
flying
from
her
masts
and
the
deck
swarming
with
smart
bonnets
and
bodices
her
name
was
the
from
which
the
sagacious
reader
will
infer
that
this
excursion
was
made
during
the
late
reign
the
yorkshireman
and
tommy
sly
having
wormed
their
way
among
the
boats
were
at
length
brought
up
within
one
of
the
vessels
and
after
lying
on
their
oars
a
few
seconds
they
were
attracted
by
now
sir
are
you
going
to
sleep
there
addressed
to
a
rival
nautical
whose
boat
obstructed
the
way
and
on
looking
up
on
deck
what
a
sight
burst
upon
the
yorkshireman
astonished
vision
mr
jorrocks
with
his
coat
off
and
a
fine
green
velvet
cap
or
turban
with
a
broad
gold
band
and
tassel
on
his
head
hoisting
a
great
hamper
out
of
the
wherry
rejecting
all
offers
of
assistance
and
treating
the
laughter
and
jeers
of
the
porters
and
bystanders
with
ineffable
contempt
at
length
he
placed
the
load
to
his
liking
and
putting
on
his
coat
adjusted
his
hunting
telescope
and
advanced
to
the
side
as
the
yorkshireman
mounted
the
and
came
upon
deck
werry
near
being
over
late
said
he
pulling
out
his
watch
just
at
which
moment
the
last
bell
rang
and
a
few
strokes
of
the
paddles
sent
the
vessel
away
from
the
quay
a
miss
is
as
good
as
a
mile
replied
the
yorkshireman
but
pray
what
have
you
got
in
the
hamper
in
the
why
wittles
to
be
sure
you
seem
to
forget
we
are
going
a
woyage
and
keen
the
sea
hair
is
i
brought
a
knuckle
of
weal
half
a
ham
beef
sarsingers
chickens
sherry
white
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
werry
acceptable
they
be
by
the
time
we
get
to
the
nore
or
may
be
before
ease
her
stop
her
cried
the
captain
through
his
trumpet
just
as
the
vessel
was
getting
into
her
stride
in
and
with
true
curiosity
the
passengers
flocked
to
the
side
to
see
who
was
coming
though
they
could
not
possibly
have
examined
half
they
had
on
board
jorrocks
of
course
was
not
behindhand
in
inquisitiveness
and
proceeded
to
adjust
his
telescope
a
wherry
was
seen
rowing
among
the
craft
containing
the
boatman
and
a
gentleman
in
a
woolly
white
hat
with
a
bright
coat
and
a
basket
on
his
knee
by
jingo
here
jemmy
green
exclaimed
jorrocks
taking
his
telescope
from
his
eye
and
giving
his
thigh
a
hearty
slap
how
unkimmon
lucky
the
werry
man
of
all
others
i
should
most
like
to
see
you
know
james
green
do
you
addressing
the
yorkshireman
young
james
green
junior
of
tooley
street
everybody
knows
him
most
agreeable
young
man
in
christendom
fine
warbler
beautiful
dancer
everything
that
a
young
man
should
be
how
are
you
james
cried
jorrocks
seizing
him
by
the
hand
as
his
friend
stepped
upon
deck
but
whether
it
was
the
nervousness
occasioned
by
the
rocking
of
the
wherry
or
the
shaking
of
the
up
the
side
of
the
steamer
or
jorrocks
new
turban
cap
but
green
with
an
reserve
drew
back
from
the
proffered
embrace
of
his
friend
you
have
the
adwantage
of
me
sir
said
he
fidgeting
back
as
he
spoke
and
eyeing
jorrocks
with
unmeasured
surprise
yet
stay
if
i
not
deceived
it
jorrocks
so
it
is
and
thereupon
they
joined
hands
most
cordially
amid
exclamations
of
are
you
j
ow
are
you
g
are
you
j
so
glad
to
see
you
j
so
glad
to
see
you
g
so
glad
to
see
you
j
and
pray
what
may
you
have
in
your
basket
inquired
jorrocks
putting
his
hand
to
the
bottom
of
a
neat
little
willow
basket
apparently
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
its
weight
only
my
clothes
and
a
little
prowision
for
the
woyage
a
baked
pigeon
some
cold
maccaroni
and
a
few
pectoral
lozenges
at
the
bottom
are
my
margate
shoes
with
a
comb
in
one
and
a
razor
in
then
comes
the
prog
and
at
the
top
i
a
dickey
and
a
clean
front
for
i
abominates
travelling
with
much
luggage
where
i
ax
is
the
use
of
carrying
nightcaps
when
the
innkeepers
always
prowide
them
without
extra
charge
the
same
with
regard
to
soap
shave
i
say
with
what
you
find
in
your
tray
a
wet
towel
makes
an
excellent
and
a
both
cuts
and
cleans
your
nails
perhaps
you
present
your
friend
to
me
added
he
in
the
same
breath
with
a
glance
at
the
yorkshireman
upon
whose
arm
jorrocks
was
resting
his
telescope
hand
much
pleasure
replied
jorrocks
with
his
usual
urbanity
allow
me
to
introduce
stubbs
green
green
stubbs
now
pray
shake
hands
added
he
for
i
sure
you
be
werry
fond
of
each
other
and
thereupon
jemmy
in
the
most
patronising
manner
extended
his
two
forefingers
to
the
yorkshireman
who
presented
him
with
one
in
return
for
the
information
of
such
of
our
readers
as
may
never
have
seen
james
green
senior
junior
either
in
tooley
street
southwark
where
the
patronymic
name
abounds
or
at
tattersall
where
he
generally
exhibits
on
a
monday
afternoon
we
may
premise
that
though
a
little
man
in
stature
he
is
a
great
man
in
mind
and
a
great
swell
in
costume
on
the
present
occasion
as
already
stated
he
had
on
a
woolly
white
hat
his
usual
coat
with
a
fine
false
front
to
his
shirt
embroidered
plaited
and
puckered
like
a
down
the
front
were
three
or
four
different
sorts
of
studs
and
a
butterfly
brooch
made
of
various
coloured
glasses
sat
in
the
centre
his
cravat
was
of
a
yellow
silk
with
a
flowered
border
confining
gills
sharp
and
pointed
that
looked
up
his
nostrils
his
waistcoat
was
of
red
and
yellow
tartan
with
blue
glass
buttons
and
his
trousers
which
were
very
wide
and
cut
out
over
the
foot
of
were
of
a
broad
blue
stripe
upon
a
white
ground
a
curly
bushy
wig
protruded
from
the
sides
of
his
woolly
white
hat
and
shaded
a
vacant
countenance
which
formed
the
frontispiece
of
a
great
chuckle
head
gloves
and
a
stout
cane
with
large
tassels
completed
the
rigging
of
this
borough
dandy
altogether
he
was
as
fine
as
any
peacock
and
as
vain
as
the
proudest
and
is
mrs
j
inquired
green
with
the
utmost
affability
i
hopes
she
uncommon
well
pray
is
she
of
your
party
looking
round
why
no
replied
jorrocks
she
off
at
tooting
at
her
mother
and
i
just
away
on
the
sly
to
stay
a
at
margate
this
delightful
weather
long
do
you
remain
oh
only
till
monday
morning
i
goes
every
saturday
in
fact
added
he
in
an
undertone
i
a
season
ticket
so
i
may
just
as
well
use
it
as
stay
poking
in
tooley
street
with
the
old
folks
who
really
are
so
uncommon
glumpy
that
it
quite
refreshing
to
get
away
from
them
that
a
pity
replied
jorrocks
with
one
of
his
benevolent
looks
but
comes
it
james
you
are
not
married
you
are
not
a
bouy
now
and
should
be
looking
out
for
a
home
of
your
own
true
my
dear
j
true
replied
green
and
i
tell
you
wot
our
principal
and
i
have
made
many
calculations
on
the
subject
and
being
a
man
of
literature
like
yourself
he
gave
it
as
his
opinion
the
last
time
we
talked
the
matter
over
that
it
would
only
be
avoiding
silly
and
running
into
which
i
presume
means
quod
or
the
bench
unless
he
can
have
a
wife
to
order
he
says
he
never
wed
besides
the
women
are
such
a
bothersome
encroaching
set
i
declare
i
so
pestered
with
them
that
i
do
know
vich
vay
to
turn
they
are
always
tormenting
of
me
only
last
week
one
sent
me
a
specification
of
what
she
marry
me
for
and
i
declare
her
dress
alone
came
to
more
than
i
have
to
find
myself
in
clothes
keep
an
go
to
theatres
buy
lozenges
and
everything
else
with
there
were
bumbazeens
and
challies
and
merinos
and
crape
and
gauze
and
dimity
and
caps
bonnets
stockings
shoes
boots
rigids
stays
ringlets
and
would
you
believe
it
she
had
the
unspeakable
audacity
to
include
a
bustle
it
was
the
most
monstrous
specification
and
proposal
i
ever
read
and
i
returned
it
by
the
twopenny
post
axing
her
if
she
had
forgotten
to
include
a
set
of
false
teeth
still
i
confess
tired
of
tooley
street
i
feel
that
i
have
a
soul
above
hemp
and
was
intended
for
a
brighter
sphere
but
vot
can
one
do
cooped
up
at
home
without
men
of
henergy
for
companions
no
prospect
of
improvement
either
for
i
left
our
old
gentleman
alarmingly
well
just
now
pulling
about
the
flax
and
tow
as
though
his
dinner
depended
upon
his
exertions
i
think
if
the
women
would
let
me
alone
i
might
have
some
chance
but
it
worries
a
man
of
sensibility
and
refinement
to
have
them
always
tormenting
of
i
no
objection
to
be
led
but
dash
my
buttons
i
vo
be
driven
certainly
not
replied
jorrocks
with
great
gravity
jingling
the
silver
in
his
it
an
old
saying
james
and
times
proves
it
true
that
you
may
take
an
to
the
water
but
you
car
make
him
drink
and
talking
of
pray
how
are
you
off
in
that
line
oh
werry
well
uncommon
i
may
say
a
thoroughbred
bang
tail
down
to
the
hocks
by
phantom
out
of
baron
munchausen
dam
gave
a
hatful
of
money
for
him
at
five
fives
a
deal
of
tin
as
times
go
but
he
a
perfect
i
assure
you
bright
bay
with
four
black
legs
and
never
a
white
hair
upon
him
he
touched
in
the
vind
but
that
nothing
i
not
a
you
know
jorrocks
besides
i
find
the
music
he
makes
werry
useful
in
the
streets
as
a
warning
to
the
old
happle
women
to
get
out
of
the
way
pray
sir
turning
to
the
yorkshireman
with
a
jerk
do
you
dance
as
the
boat
band
consisting
of
a
harp
a
flute
a
lute
a
long
horn
and
a
short
horn
struck
up
a
quadrille
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
our
hero
sidled
past
and
glided
among
the
crowd
that
covered
the
deck
a
fine
young
man
james
observed
jorrocks
eyeing
jemmy
as
he
elbowed
his
way
down
the
boat
fine
young
man
wants
a
little
of
his
father
ballast
but
there
no
putting
old
heads
on
young
shoulders
he
a
beautiful
dancer
added
jorrocks
putting
his
arm
through
the
yorkshireman
let
go
and
see
him
foot
it
having
worked
their
way
down
they
at
length
got
near
the
dancers
and
mounting
a
ballast
box
had
a
fine
view
of
the
quadrille
there
were
eight
or
ten
couple
at
work
and
jemmy
had
chosen
a
fat
dumpy
girl
in
a
bright
muslin
gown
with
black
velvet
vandyked
flounces
and
green
boots
a
sort
of
walking
sunflower
with
whom
he
was
pointing
his
toe
kicking
out
behind
and
pirouetting
with
great
energy
and
agility
his
male
was
a
waistcoatless
young
daniel
lambert
in
white
ducks
and
a
blue
with
a
carnation
in
his
mouth
who
with
a
damsel
in
ten
colours
reel
to
and
fro
in
humble
imitation
green
for
ever
cried
jorrocks
taking
off
his
velvet
cap
and
waving
it
encouragingly
over
his
head
green
for
ever
go
it
green
and
accordingly
green
went
it
with
redoubled
vigour
wiggins
for
ever
responded
a
female
voice
opposite
i
say
wiggins
which
was
followed
by
a
loud
clapping
of
hands
as
the
fat
gentleman
made
an
astonishing
step
each
had
his
admiring
applauders
though
wiggins
had
the
call
among
the
ladies
the
opposition
voice
that
put
him
in
nomination
proceeding
from
the
mother
of
his
partner
who
like
her
daughter
was
a
sort
of
walking
pattern
book
the
spirit
of
emulation
lasted
throughout
the
quadrille
after
which
sunflower
in
hand
green
traversed
the
deck
to
receive
the
compliments
of
the
company
you
must
be
observed
jorrocks
with
great
politeness
to
the
lady
after
all
your
exertions
as
the
latter
stood
mopping
herself
with
a
coarse
linen
handkerchief
pray
james
bring
your
partner
to
our
and
let
me
offer
her
some
refreshment
which
was
one
word
for
the
sunflower
and
two
for
himself
the
sea
breeze
having
made
jorrocks
what
he
called
unkimmon
peckish
the
hamper
was
speedily
opened
the
knuckle
of
veal
the
half
ham
the
aitch
bone
of
beef
the
dorking
sausages
made
in
drury
lane
the
chickens
and
some
dozen
or
two
of
plovers
eggs
were
exhibited
while
green
with
disinterested
generosity
added
his
baked
pigeon
and
cold
maccaroni
to
the
common
stock
a
vigorous
attack
was
speedily
commenced
and
was
kept
up
with
occasional
interruptions
by
green
running
away
to
dance
until
they
hove
in
sight
of
herne
bay
which
caused
an
interruption
to
a
very
interesting
lecture
on
wines
that
jorrocks
was
in
the
act
of
delivering
which
went
to
prove
that
port
and
sherry
were
the
parents
of
all
wines
port
the
father
and
sherry
the
mother
and
that
bluecellas
hock
burgundy
claret
teneriffe
madeira
were
made
by
the
addition
of
water
vinegar
and
a
few
chemical
ingredients
and
that
of
all
humbugs
pale
sherry
was
the
greatest
being
neither
more
nor
less
than
brown
sherry
watered
jorrocks
then
set
to
work
to
pack
up
the
leavings
in
the
hamper
observing
as
he
proceeded
that
wilful
waste
brought
woeful
want
and
that
waste
not
want
not
had
ever
been
the
motto
of
the
jorrocks
family
it
was
nearly
eight
ere
the
touched
the
point
of
the
margate
jetty
a
fact
that
was
announced
as
well
by
the
usual
bump
and
scuttle
to
the
side
to
get
out
first
as
by
the
band
striking
up
save
the
and
the
mate
demanding
the
tickets
of
the
passengers
the
sun
had
just
dropped
beneath
the
horizon
and
the
of
the
town
had
been
considerately
lighted
to
show
him
to

the
full
vigour
of
life
and
light
two
or
three
other
cargoes
of
cockneys
having
arrived
before
the
whole
place
was
in
commotion
and
the
beach
swarmed
with
spectators
as
anxious
to
watch
this
last
disembarkation
as
they
had
been
to
see
the
first
by
a
salutary
regulation
of
the
sages
who
watch
over
the
interests
of
the
town
all
manner
of
persons
are
prohibited
from
walking
upon
the
jetty
during
this
ceremony
but
the
platform
of
which
it
is
composed
being
very
low
those
who
stand
on
the
beach
outside
the
rails
are
just
about
on
a
right
level
to
shoot
their
impudence
cleverly
into
the
ears
of
the
who
are
paraded
along
two
lines
of
gaping
quizzing
laughing
joking
jeering
citizens
who
fire
volleys
of
wit
and
satire
upon
them
as
they

exclaimed
a
with
two
fat
ruddy
children
in
her
arms

a
beauty
without
paint
hallo
jorrocks
my
hearty
lend
us
your
hand
cried
a
brother
member
of
the
surrey
hunt
then
there
was
a
pointing
of
fingers
and
cries
of
that
jorrocks
that
green
that
green
jorrocks
and
a
murmuring
titter
and
exclamations
of
simpkins
how
pretty
he
is
but
there
wiggins
who
much
nicer
my
eye
what
a

thompson

what
gummy

that

in

has
miss
bustle
on
crooked
from
the
young
ladies
at

trimmer
seminary
who
were
drawn
up
to
show
the
numerical
strength
of
the
academy
and
act
the
part
of
walking
advertisements
these
observations
were
speedily
drowned
by
the
lusty
lungs
of
a
flyman
bellowing
out
as
green
passed
hallo
my
young
are
you
here
again
now
then
for
the
tizzy
you
owe
me
i
have
been
waiting
here
for
it
ever
since
last
monday
morning
this
salute
produced
an
irate
look
and
a
shake
of
his
cane
from
green
with
a
mutter
of
something
about
imperance
and
a
wish
that
he
had
his
big
fighting
foreman
there
to
thrash
him
when
they
got
to
the
gate
at
the
end
the
tide
of
fashion
became
obstructed
by
the
kissings
of
husbands
and
wives
the
greetings
of
fathers
and
sons
the
officiousness
of
porters
the
cries
of
flymen
the
importunities
of
innkeepers
the
cards
of
the
salutations
of
donkey
drivers
the
programmes
of
librarians
and
the
rush
and
push
of
the
inquisitive
and
the
waters
of
comers
and
stayers
mingled
in
one
common
flood
of
indescribable
confusion
jorrocks
who
hamper
in
hand
had
elbowed
his
way
with
persevering
resignation
here
found
himself
so
beset
with
friends
all
anxious
to
wring
his
digits
that
fearful
of
losing
either
his
bed
or
his
friends
he
besought
green
to
step
on
to
the
white
hart
and
see
about
accommodation
accordingly
green
ran
his
fingers
through
the
bushy
sides
of
his
yellow
wig
jerked
up
his
gills
and
with
a
air
strutted
up
to
that
inn
which
as
all
frequenters
of
margate
know
stands
near
the
and
commands
a
fine
view
of
the
harbour
creed
the
landlord
was
airing
himself
at
the
door
or
as
shakespeare
has
it
taking
his
ease
at
his
inn
and
knowing
green
of
old
to
be
a
most
unprofitable
customer
he
did
not
trouble
to
move
his
position
farther
than
just
to
draw
up
one
leg
so
as
not
wholly
to
obstruct
the
passage
and
looked
at
him
as
much
as
to
say
i
prefer
your
room
to
your
company
quite
full
here
sir
said
he
anticipating
green
question
full
indeed
replied
jemmy
pulling
up
his
gills
that
werry
awkward
jorrocks
has
come
down
with
myself
and
a
friend
and
we
want
accommodation
jorrocks
indeed
replied
creed
altering
his
tone
and
manner
i
sure
i
shall
be
delighted
to
receive
jorrocks
he
one
of
the
oldest
customers
i
have
and
one
of
the
best
none
of
your
of
water
and
gentleman
real
downright
man
likes
it
hot
and
strong
from
the
wood
always
pays
like
a
gentleman
never
fights
about
like
some
people
i
know
looking
at
jemmy
pray
what
rooms
may
you
require
vy
there
myself
jorrocks
and
jorrocks
other
friend
three
in
all
and
we
shall
want
three
good
hairy
bedrooms
well
i
do
know
replied
creed
laughing
about
their
hairiness
but
i
can
rub
them
with
bear
grease
for
you
jemmy
pulled
up
his
gills
and
was
about
to
reply
when
jorrocks
appearance
interrupted
the
dialogue
creed
advanced
to
receive
him
blowing
up
his
porters
for
not
having
been
down
to
carry
up
the
hamper
which
he
took
himself
and
bore
to
the
amid
protestations
of
his
delight
at
seeing
his
worthy
visitor
having
talked
over
the
changes
of
margate
of
those
that
were
there
those
that
were
not
and
those
that
were
coming
and
adverted
to
the
important
topic
of
supper
jorrocks
took
out
his
yellow
and
white
spotted
handkerchief
and
proceeded
to
flop
his
hessian
boots
while
creed
with
his
own
hands
rubbed
him
over
with
a
long
brush
green
too
put
himself
in
form
by
the
aid
of
the
and
these
preliminaries
being
adjusted
the
trio
sallied
forth
jorrocks
occupying
the
centre
it
was
a
fine
balmy
summer
evening
the
beetles
and
moths
still
buzzed
and
flickered
in
the
air
and
the
sea
rippled
against
the
shingly
shore
with
a
low
indistinct
murmur
that
scarcely
sounded
among
the
busy
hum
of
men
the
shades
of
night
were
drawing
on
a
slight
mist
hung
about
the
hills
and
a
silvery
moon
shed
a
broad
brilliant
ray
upon
the
quivering
waters
of
the
dark
blue
sea
and
an
equal
light
over
the
wide
expanse
of
the
troubled
town
how
strange
that
man
should
leave
the
quiet
scenes
of
nature
to
mix
in
myriads
of
those
they
profess
to
quit
cities
to
avoid
one
turn
to
the
shore
and
the
of
the
town
drew
back
the
party
like
moths
to
the
streets
which
were
literally
swarming
with
the
population
cheapside
at
three
in
the
afternoon
as
jorrocks
observed
was
never
fuller
than
margate
streets
that
evening
all
was
lighted
up
all
brilliant
and
all
gay
care
seemed
banished
from
every
countenance
and
pretty
faces
and
smart
gowns
reigned
in
its
stead
jorrocks
met
with
friends
and
acquaintances
at
every
turn
most
of
whom
asked
when
he
came
and
when
he
was
going
away
having
perambulated
the
streets
the
sound
of
music
attracted
jemmy
attention
and
our
party
turned
into
a
long
crowded
and
brilliantly
lighted
bazaar
just
as
the
last
notes
of
a
at
the
far
end
faded
away
and
a
young
woman
in
a
hat
and
feathers
with
a
muff
and
tippet
was
handed
by
a
very
smart
young
man
in
dirty
white
berlin
gloves
and
an
equally
soiled
white
waistcoat
into
a
sort
of
orchestra
above
where
after
the
plaudits
of
the
company
had
subsided
she
if
i
had
a
donkey
vot
vould
go
at
the
conclusion
of
the
song
and
before
the
company
had
time
to
disperse
the
same
smart
young
gentleman
having
rehanded
the
young
lady
from
the
orchestra
and
pocketed
his
gloves
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
and
announced
from
that
eminence
that
the
spirited
proprietors
of
the
bazaar
were
then
going
to
offer
for
public
competition
in
the
enterprising
shape
of
a
raffle
in
tickets
at
one
shilling
each
a
most
magnificently
genteel
rosewood
general
perfume
box
fitted
up
with
cedar
and
lined
with
red
silk
velvet
adorned
with
clasps
at
the
sides
and
a
solid
massive
silver
at
the
top
with
a
best
patent
bramah
lock
and
six
chaste
and
beautifully
rich
bottles
and
a
mirror
at
the
top
a
box
so
splendidly
perfect
so
beautifully
unique
as
alike
to
defy
the
powers
of
praise
and
the
critiques
of
the
envious
and
thereupon
he
produced
a
flashy
sort
of
thing
that
might
be
worth
three
and
sixpence
for
which
he
modestly
required
ten
subscribers
at
a
shilling
each
adding
that
even
with
that
number
the
proprietors
would
incur
a
werry
heavy
loss
for
which
nothing
but
a
boundless
sense
of
gratitude
for
favours
past
could
possibly
recompense
them
the
eloquence
and
the
glitter
of
the
box
reflecting
as
it
did
at
every
turn
the
both
in
its
steel
and
glass
had
the
desired
effect

the
sunflower
drew
near
green
looked
confused
she
fixed
her
eye
upon
him
half
in
fear
half
in
entreaty
would
he
offer
to
throw
for
her
no
by
jove
green
was
not
so
green
as
all
that
came
to
and
he
let
her
shake
herself
she
threw
thereby
putting
an
extinguisher
on
the
boy
and
raising
jemmy
chance
considerably
three
was
held
by
a
youngster
in
nankeen
petticoats
who
would
throw
for
himself
and
shook
the
box
violently
enough
to
be
heard
at
broadstairs
he
scored
nineteen
and
beginning
to
cry
immediately
was
taken
home
green
was
next
and
all
eyes
turned
upon
him
for
he
was
a
noted
hand
he
advanced
to
the
table
with
great
sangfroid
and
turning
back
the
wrists
of
his
coat
exhibited
his
beautiful
sparkling
paste
shirt
buttons
and
the
elegant
turn
of
his
taper
hand
the
middle
finger
of
which
was
covered
with
massive
rings
he
took
the
box
in
a
manner
and
without
condescending
to
shake
it
slid
the
dice
out
upon
the
table
by
a
gentle
sideway
motion
sixes
cried
all
and
down
the
marker
put
twelve
at
the
second
throw
he
adopted
another
mode
as
soon
as
the
dice
were
in
he
just
chucked
them
up
in
the
air
like
as
many
halfpence
and
down
they
came
five
and
six
eleven
said
the
marker
with
a
look
of
triumph
green
held
the
box
for
the
third
time
which
he
just
turned
upside
down
and
lo
on
uncovering
there
stood
two
ones
a
loud
laugh
burst
forth
and
green
looked
confused
i
so
glad
whispered
a
young
lady
who
had
made
an
unsuccessful
set
at
jemmy
the
previous
season
in
a
tone
loud
enough
for
him
to
hear
i
hope
lose
rejoined
a
female
friend
rather
louder
that
jemmy
green
is
my
absolute
abhorrence
observed
a
third
man
with
his
nasty
vig
observed
the
mamma
of
the
first
speaker
should
have
my
darter
not
at
no
price
green
however
headed
the
poll
having
beat
the
sunflower
and
had
still
two
lots
in
reserve
for
number
five
he
threw
and
was
immediately
outstripped
amid
much
laughter
and
clapping
of
hands
from
the
ladies
by
number
six
who
in
his
turn
fell
a
prey
to
number
seven
between
eight
and
nine
there
was
a
very
interesting
contest
who
should
be
lowest
and
hopes
and
fears
were
at
their
altitude
when
jemmy
green
again
turned
back
his
to
throw
for
number
ten
his
confidence
had
forsaken
him
a
little
as
indicated
by
a
slight
quivering
of
the
but
he
managed
to
conceal
it
from
all
except
the
ladies
who
kept
too
scrutinising
an
eye
upon
him
his
first
throw
brought
sixes
which
raised
his
spirits
amazingly
but
on
their
appearance
a
second
time
he
could
scarcely
contain
himself
backed
as
he
was
by
the
plaudits
of
his
friend
jorrocks
then
came
the
deciding
throw
every
eye
was
fixed
on
jemmy
he
shook
the
box
turned
it
down
and
lo
there
came
seven
james
green
is
the
fortunate
winner
of
this
magnificent
prize
exclaimed
the
youth
holding
up
the
box
in
and
thereupon
all
the
ladies
crowded
round
green
some
to
congratulate
him
others
to
compliment
him
on
his
looks
while
one
or
two
of
the
least
knowing
tried
to
coax
him
out
of
his
box
jemmy
however
was
too
old
a
stager
and
pocketed
the
box
and
other
compliments
at
the
same
time
another
grind
of
the
organ
and
another
song
followed
from
the
same
young
lady
during
which
operation
green
sent
for
the
manager
and
after
a
little
beating
about
the
bush
proposed
singing
a
song
or
two
if
he
would
give
him
gratis
he
asked
three
for
each
song
and
finally
closed
for
five
tickets
for
two
songs
on
the
understanding
that
he
was
to
be
announced
as
a
distinguished
amateur
who
had
come
forward
by
most
particular
desire
accordingly
the
manager
a
roundabout
consequential
little
cockney
mounted
the
rostrum
and
begged
to
announce
to
the
company
that
that
celebrated
wocalist
james
green
so
well
known
as
a
distinguished
amateur
and
conwivialist
both
at
bagnigge
wells
and
vite
conduit
house
london
had
werry
kindly
consented
in
order
to
promote
the
hilarity
of
the
evening
to
favour
the
company
with
a
song
immediately
after
the
drawing
of
the
next
lottery
and
after
a
few
compliments
which
elicited
a
laugh
from
those
who
were
up
to
jemmy
mode
of
doing
business
he
concluded
by
offering
a
for
public
competition
in
shilling
lots
as
before
as
soon
as
the
drawing
was
over
they
gave
the
organ
a
grind
and
jemmy
popped
up
with
a
hop
step
and
a
jump
with
his
woolly
white
hat
under
his
arm
and
presented
himself
with
a
scrape
and
a
bow
to
the
company
after
a
few
preparatory
hems
and
haws
he
pulled
up
his
gills
and
spoke
as
follows
ladies
and
gentlemen
hem
another
pull
at
his
gills
ladies
and
gentlemen
my
walued
friend
kitey
graves
has
announced
that
i
will
entertain
the
company
with
a
song
though
nothing
i
assure
you
hem
could
be
farther
from
my
idea
hem
when
my
excellent
friend
asked
me
hookey
walker
exclaimed
someone
who
had
heard
jemmy
declare
the
same
thing
half
a
dozen
times
and
indeed
ladies
and
gentlemen
hem
nothing
but
the
werry
great
regard
i
have
for
kitey
graves
who
i
have
known
and
loved
ever
since
he
was
the
height
of
sixpennorth
of
coppers
a
loud
laugh
followed
this
allusion
seeing
that
would
almost
measure
out
the
speaker
on
giving
another
hem
and
again
pulling
up
his
gills
an
old

the
farmer
only
you
pulled
at
your
shirt
so
long
that
i
think
you
must
be
bare
behind
haw
haw
haw
at
which
all
the
males
roared
with
laughter
and
the
females
hid
their
faces
in
their
handkerchiefs
and
tittered
and
giggled
and
tried
to
be
shocked
order
order
cried
jorrocks
in
a
loud
and
sonorous
voice
which
had
the
effect
of
quelling
the
riot
and
drawing
all
eyes
upon
himself
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
he
taking
off
his
cap
with
great
gravity
and
extending
his
right
arm
immodest
words
admit
of
no
defence
for
want
of
decency
is
want
of
sense
a
couplet
so
apropos
and
so
well
delivered
as
to
have
the
immediate
effect
of
restoring
order
and
making
the
farmer
look
foolish
encouraged
by
the
voice
of
his
great
patron
green
once
more
essayed
to
finish
his
speech
which
he
did
by
a
fresh
assurance
of
the
surprise
by
which
he
had
been
taken
by
the
request
of
his
friend
kitey
graves
and
an
exhortation
for
the
company
to
make
allowance
for
any
deficiency
of
woice
inasmuch
as
how
as
labouring
under
a
wiolent
for
which
he
had
long
been
taking
pectoral
lozenges
he
then
gave
his
gills
another
pull
felt
if
they
were
even
and
struck
up
bid
me
discourse
in
notes
compared
to
which
the
screaming
of
a
peacock
would
be
perfect
melody
jorrocks
having
taken
a
conspicuous
position
applauded
long
loudly
and
warmly
at
every
pause
approbation
the
more
deserved
and
disinterested
inasmuch
as
the
worthy
gentleman
suffers
considerably
from
music
and
only
knows
two
tunes
one
of
which
he
says
is
save
the
and
the
other
is
having
seen
his
protégé
fairly
under
way
jorrocks
gave
him
a
hint
that
he
would
return
to
the
white
hart
and
have
supper
ready
by
the
time
he
was
done
accordingly
the
yorkshireman
and
he
withdrew
along
an
avenue
politely
formed
by
the
separation
of
the
company
who
applauded
as
they
passed
an
imperial
quart
and
a
half
of
creed
stoutest
draft
port
with
the
orthodox
proportion
of
lemon
cloves
sugar
and
cinnamon
had
almost
boiled
itself
to
perfection
under
the
skilful
superintendence
of
jorrocks
on
the
fire
and
a
table
had
been
handsomely
decorated
with
shrimps
lobsters
broiled
bones
fried
ham
poached
eggs
when
just
as
the
clock
had
finished
striking
eleven
the
door
opened
with
a
rush
and
in
tripped
jemmy
green
with
his
hands
crammed
full
of
packages
and
his
trousers
pockets
sticking
out
like
a
dutch
burgomaster
vell
i
done
brown
i
think
said
he
depositing
his
hat
and
half
a
dozen
packages
on
the
sideboard
and
running
his
fingers
through
his
curls
to
make
them
stand
up
i
won
nine
lotteries
and
left
one
undrawn
when
i
came
away
because
it
did
not
seem
likely
to
fill
let
me
see
said
he
emptying
his
pockets
there
is
the
beautiful
rosewood
box
that
i
won
ven
you
was
there
the
next
was
a
set
of
vich
i
von
also
the
third
was
a
which
i
did
not
want
and
only
stood
one
ticket
for
and
lost
the
fourth
was
this
elegant
box
with
a
view
of
margate
on
the
lid
then
came
these
six
sherry
labels
with
silver
rims
a
with
an
inwisible
mouse
a
coral
rattle
with
silver
bells
a
silk
yard
measure
in
a
a
couple
of
west
india
beetles
a
in
a
glass
case
which
i
lost
and
then
these
dozen
bodkins
with
silver
eyes
so
that
altogether
i
have
made
a
pretty
good
work
of
it
kitey
graves
was
in
great
force
so
after
i
had
sung
me
and
be
a
i
cut
my
stick
and
went
to
the
hopposition
shop
where
they
used
me
much
more
genteelly
giving
me
three
tickets
for
a
song
and
introducing
me
in
more
flattering
terms
to
the
company
do
like
being
considered
one
of
the
nasty
and
they
should
make
a
point
of
explaining
that
one
is
besides
what
business
had
kitey
to
say
anything
about
bagnigge
vells
a
hass
now
perhaps
you
favour
me
with
some
supper
certainly
replied
jorrocks
patting
jemmy
approvingly
on
the
head
you
deserve
some
it
only
no
song
no
supper
and
been
singing
like
a
nightingale
thereupon
they
set
to
with
vigorous
determination
a
bright
sunday
dawned
and
the
beach
at
an
early
hour
was
crowded
with
men
in
of
every
shape
hue
and
material
with
buff
slippers
the
regulation
margate
shoeing
both
for
men
and
women
as
the
hour
of
eleven
approached
and
the
church
bells
began
to
ring
the
town
seemed
to
awaken
suddenly
from
a
trance
and
bonnets
the
most
superb
and
dresses
the
most
extravagant
poured
forth
from
lodgings
the
most
miserable
having
shaved
and
dressed
himself
with
more
than
ordinary
care
and
attention
jorrocks
walked
his
friends
off
to
church
assuring
them
that
no
one
need
hope
to
prosper
throughout
the
week
who
did
not
attend
it
on
the
sunday
and
he
marked
his
own
devotion
throughout
the
service
by
drowning
the
clerk
voice
with
his
responses
after
this
spiritual
ablution
jorrocks
bethought
himself
of
having
a
bodily
one
in
the
sea
and
the
day
being
excessively
hot
and
the
tide
about
the
proper
mark
he
pocketed
a
couple
of
towels
out
of
his
bedroom
and
went
away
to
bathe
leaving
green
and
the
yorkshireman
to
amuse
themselves
at
the
white
hart
this
house
as
we
have
already
stated
faces
the
harbour
and
is
a
corner
one
running
a
considerable
way
up
the
next
street
with
a
side
door
communicating
as
well
as
the
front
one
with
the
this
room
differs
from
the
generality
of
inasmuch
as
the
windows
range
the
whole
length
of
the
room
and
being
very
low
they
afford
every
facility
for
the
children
and
to
inspect
the
interior
whether
this
is
done
to
show
the
turkey
carpet
the
cornices
the
bright
mahogany
slips
of
tables
the
gay
trellised
room
or
the
aristocratic
visitors
who
frequent
it
is
immaterial
the
description
is
as
accurate
as
if
george
robins
had
drawn
it
himself
in
this
room
then
as
the
yorkshireman
and
green
were
lying
dozing
on
three
chairs
apiece
each
having
fallen
asleep
to
avoid
the
trouble
of
talking
to
the
other
they
were
suddenly
roused
by
loud
yells
and
hootings
at
the
side
door
and
the
bursting
into
the
of
what
at
first
brush
they
thought
must
be
a
bull
the
yorkshireman
jumped
up
rubbed
his
eyes
and
lo
before
him
stood
jorrocks
puffing
like
a
stranded
grampus
with
a
bunch
of
under
his
arm
and
the
dress
in
which
he
had
started
with
the
exception
of
the
dark
blue
pantaloons
the
place
of
which
were
supplied
by
a
flowing
white
linen
kilt
commonly
called
a
shirt
in
the
four
corners
of
which
were
knotted
a
few
small
pebbles
producing
with
the
hessian
boots
and
one
thing
and
another
the
most
laughable
figure
imaginable
the
blood
of
the
jorrockses
was
up
however
and
throwing
his
hands
in
the
air
he
thus
delivered
himself
oh
gentlemen
gentlemen
here
a
lamentable
occurrence
a
terrible
disaster
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
never
thought
i
should
come
to
this
you
know
james
green
appealing
to
jemmy
that
i
never
was
the
man
to
raise
a
blush
on
the
cheek
of
modesty
i
have
always
said
that
of
decency
is
want
of
sense
and
see
how
i
am
rewarded
oh
dear
oh
dear
that
i
should
ever
have
trusted
my
pantaloons
out
of
my
sight
while
all
this
which
was
the
work
of
a
moment
was
going
forward
the
mob
which
had
been
shut
out
at
the
side
door
on
jorrocks
entry
had
got
round
to
the
window
and
were
all
wedging
their
faces
in
to
have
a
sight
of
him
it
was
principally
composed
of
children
who
kept
up
the
most
discordant
yells
mingled
with
shouts
of
there
old
cutty
shirt
who
got
your
breeches
old
cock
make
a
scramble
turn
him
out
for
another
hunt
turn
him
again
until
fearing
for
the
respectability
of
his
house
the
landlord
persuaded
jorrocks
to
retire
into
the
bar
to
state
his
grievances
it
then
appeared
that
having
travelled
along
the
coast
as
far
as
the
first
preventive
stationhouse
on
the
ramsgate
side
of
margate
the
grocer
had
thought
it
a
convenient
place
for
performing
his
intended
ablutions
and
accordingly
proceeded
to
do
what
all
people
of
either
sex
agree
upon
in
such
cases
namely
to
divest
himself
of
his
garments
but
before
he
completed
the
ceremony
observing
some
females
on
the
cliffs
above
and
not
being
as
he
said
a
man
to
raise
a
blush
on
the
cheek
of
modesty
he
advanced
to
the
water
edge
in
his
aforesaid
unmentionables
and
forgetting
that
it
was
not
yet
high
tide
he
left
them
there
when
they
were
speedily
covered
and
the
pockets
being
full
of
silver
and
copper
of
course
they
were
swamped
after
dabbling
about
in
the
water
and
amusing
himself
with
picking
up
for
about
ten
minutes
jorrocks
was
horrified
on
returning
to
the
spot
where
he
thought
he
had
left
his
pantaloons
to
find
that
they
had
disappeared
and
after
a
long
fruitless
search
the
unfortunate
gentleman
was
compelled
to
abandon
the
pursuit
and
render
himself
an
object
of
chase
to
all
the
little
boys
and
girls
who
chose
to
follow
him
into
margate
on
his
return
without
them
jorrocks
as
might
be
expected
was
very
bad
about
his
loss
and
could
not
get
over
it
it
stuck
in
his
gizzard
he
said
and
there
it
seemed
likely
to
remain
in
vain
creed
offered
him
a
pair
of
trousers
he
never
had
worn
a
pair
in
vain
he
asked
for
the
loan
of
a
pair
of
white
cords
and
or
even
drab
shorts
and
continuations
creed
was
no
sportsman
and
did
not
keep
any
the
bellman
could
not
cry
the
lost
unmentionables
because
it
was
sunday
and
even
if
they
should
be
found
on
the
ebbing
of
the
tide
they
would
take
no
end
of
time
to
dry
jorrocks
declared
his
pleasure
at
an
end
and
forthwith
began
making
inquiries
as
to
the
best
mode
of
getting
home
the
coaches
were
all
gone
steamboats
there
were
none
save
for
every
place
but
london
and
posting
he
said
was
cruelly
expensive
in
the
midst
of
his
dilemma
boots
who
is
always
the
most
intelligent
man
about
an
inn
popped
in
his
curly
head
and
informed
jorrocks
that
the
unity
hoy
a
most
commodious
vessel
neat
trim
and
manned
by
his
own
maternal
uncle
was
going
to
cut
away
to
london
at
three
and
would
land
him
before
he
could
say
jack
robinson
jorrocks
jumped
at
the
offer
and
forthwith
attiring
himself
in
a
pair
of
loose
inexpressibles
over
which
he
drew
his
hessian
boots
he
tucked
the
hamper
containing
the
knuckle
of
veal
and
other
etceteras
under
one
arm
and
the
bunch
of
he
had
been
busy
collecting
instead
of
watching
his
clothes
under
the
other
and
followed
by
his
friends
made
direct
for
the
vessel
everybody
knows
or
ought
to
know
what
a
hoy
is
it
is
a
large
sometimes
with
one
deck
sometimes
with
none
and
the
unity
trading
in
bulky
goods
was
of
the
latter
description
though
there
was
a
sort
of
at
the
stern
which
the
master
dignified
by
the
name
of
a
state
cabin
into
which
he
purposed
putting
jorrocks
if
the
weather
should
turn
cold
before
they
arrived
the
wind
however
he
said
was
so
favourable
and
his
cargo
timber
and
fruit
as
he
described
it
that
is
to
say
broomsticks
and
potatoes
so
light
that
he
warranted
landing
him
at
blackwall
at
least
by
ten
where
he
could
either
sleep
or
get
a
short
stage
or
an
omnibus
on
to
leadenhall
street
the
vessel
looked
anything
but
tempting
neither
was
the
captain
appearance
prepossessing
still
jorrocks
all
things
considered
thought
he
would
chance
it
and
depositing
his
hamper
and
and
giving
special
instructions
about
having
his
pantaloons
cried
in
the
morning
recounting
that
besides
the
silver
and
in
copper
there
was
a
steel
with
on
the
seal
at
the
top
an
anonymous
letter
and
two
keys
he
took
an
affectionate
leave
of
his
friends
and
stepped
on
board
the
vessel
was
shoved
off
and
stood
out
to
sea
monday
morning
drew
the
cockneys
from
their
roosts
betimes
to
take
their
farewell
splash
and
dive
in
the
sea
as
the
day
advanced
the
bustle
and
confusion
on
the
shore
and
in
the
town
increased
and
everyone
seemed
on
the
move
the
ladies
paid
their
last
visits
to
the
bazaars
and
shell
shops
and
children
extracted
the
last
ounce
of
exertion
from
the
exhausted
donkeys
meanwhile
the
lords
of

strutted
about
some

the

finishes
striking

the
ropes
are
slipped
and
the
rival
steamers
stand
out
to
sea
with
beautiful
precision
amid
the
crying
the
kissing
of
hands
the
raising
of
hats
the
waving
of
handkerchiefs
from
those
who
are
left
for
the
week
while
the
passengers
are
cheered
by
adverse
tunes
from
the
respective
bands

but
the
keeps
well
alongside
and
both
firemen
being
deeply
interested
in
the
event
they
boil
up
a
tremendous
gallop
without
either
being
able
to
claim
the
slightest
advantage
for
upwards
of
an
hour
and
a
half
when
the
manages
to
shoot
ahead
for
a
few
minutes
amid
the
cheers
and
exclamations
of
her
crew
the
fireman
however
is
on
the
alert
and
a
few
extra
pokes
of
the
fire
presently
bring
the
boats
together
again
in
which
state
they
continue
nose
and
nose
until
the
stiller
water
of
the
side
of
the
thames
favours
the
and
she
shoots
ahead
amid
the
cheers
and
vociferations
of
her
party
and
is
not
neared
again
during
the
voyage
this
excitement
over
the
respective
crews
sink
into
a
sort
of
melancholy
sedateness
and
green
in
vain
endeavours
to
kick
up
a
quadrille
the
men
were
exhausted
and
the
women
dispirited
and
altogether
they
were
a
very
different
set
of
beings
to
what
they
were
on
the
saturday
dull
faces
and
ducks
were
the
order
of
the
day
the
only
incident
of
the
voyage
was
that
on
approaching
the
mouth
of
the
medway
the
was
hailed
by
a
vessel
and
the
yorkshireman
on
looking
overboard
was
shocked
to
behold
jorrocks
sitting
in
the
stern
of
his
hoy
in
the
identical
position
he
had
taken
up
the
previous
day
with
his
bunch
of
under
his
elbow
and
the
remains
of
the
knuckle
of
veal
ham
and
chicken
spread
on
the
hamper
before
him
stop
her
cried
the
yorkshireman
and
then
hailing
jorrocks
he
holloaed
out
in
the
name
of
the
prophet
figs
what
are
you
doing
there
oh
gentlemen
gentlemen
exclaimed
jorrocks
brightening
up
as
he
recognised
the
boat
take
compassion
on
a
most
misfortunate
indiwidual
here
have
i
been
in
this
ever
since
three
yesterday
afternoon
and
here
i
seem
likely
to
end
my
days
for
blow
me
tight
if
i
could
swim
as
fast
as
it
goes
look
sharp
then
cried
the
mate
of
the
steamer
and
chuck
us
up
your
luggage
up
went
the
the
hamper
and
jorrocks
and
before
the
hoyman
awoke
out
of
a
nap
into
which
he
had
composed
himself
on
resigning
the
rudder
to
his
lad
our
worthy
citizen
was
steaming
away
a
mile
before
his
vessel
bilking
him
of
his
fare
who
does
not
recognise
in
this
last
disaster
the
truth
of
the
old
adage
most
haste
least
speed
viii
the
road
english
and
french
jorrocks
france
in
three
wolumes
would
sound
werry
well
observed
our
worthy
citizen
one
afternoon
to
his
confidential
companion
the
yorkshireman
as
they
sat
in
the
veranda
in
coram
street
eating
red
currants
and
sipping
cold
whiskey
punch
and
i
thinks
i
could
make
something
of
it
they
tells
me
that
at
the
end
the
booksellers
will
give
forty
pounds
for
anything
that
will
run
into
three
wolumes
and
one
might
soon
pick
up
as
much
matter
as
would
stretch
into
that
quantity
the
above
observation
was
introduced
in
a
long
conversation
between
jorrocks
and
his
friend
relative
to
an
indignity
that
had
been
offered
him
by
the
rejection
by
the
editor
of
a
sporting
periodical
of
a
long
treatise
on
eels
which
independently
of
the
singularity
of
diction
had
become
so
attenuated
in
the
handling
as
to
have
every
appearance
of
filling
three
whole
numbers
of
the
work
and
jorrocks
had
determined
to
avenge
the
insult
by
turning
author
on
his
own
account
the
yorkshireman
ever
ready
for
amusement
cordially
supported
jorrocks
in
his
views
and
a
bargain
was
soon
struck
between
them
the
main
stipulations
of
which
were
that
jorrocks
should
find
cash
and
the
yorkshireman
should
procure
information
accordingly
on
the
saturday
after
the
nine
dover
heavy
drew
up
at
the
bricklayers
arms
with
jorrocks
on
the
box
seat
and
the
yorkshireman
imbedded
among
the
usual
heterogeneous
assembly
soldiers
sailors
frenchmen
fishermen
ladies
maids
and
footmen
that
compose
the
cargo
of
these
coaches
here
they
were
assailed
with
the
usual
persecution
from
the
tribe
of
israel
in
the
shape
of
a
hundred
merchants
proclaiming
the
virtues
of
their
wares
one
with
pencils
twelve
a
shilling
with
an
invitation
to
cut
and
try
another
with
a
good
twelve
blades
and
saw
sir
a
third
with
a
tame
squirrel
and
a
piping
bullfinch
that
could
whistle
save
the
and
the

the
coachman
elbowing
his
way
among
them
and
remounting
the
box
he
takes
the
whip
and
reins
out
of
jorrocks
hands
cries
all
right
behind
sit
tight
and
off
they
go
the
day
was
fine
and
the
hearts
of
all
seemed
light
and
gay
the
coach
though
slow
was
clean
and
smart
the
harness
bright
and
while
the
sleek
brown
horses
poked
their
heads
about
at
ease
without
the
torture
of
the
the
coachman
like
his
vehicle
was
heavy
and
had
he
been
set
on
all
fours
a
party
of
six
might
have
eat
off
his
back
thus
they
proceeded
at
a
good
steady
substantial
sort
of
pace
trotting
on
level
ground
walking
up
hills
and
dragging
down
inclines
nor
among
the
whole
party
was
there
a
murmur
of
discontent
at
the
pace
most
of
the
passengers
seemed
careless
which
way
they
went
so
long
as
they
did
but
move
and
they
rolled
through
the
garden
of
england
with
the
most
stoical
indifference
we
know
not
whether
it
has
ever
struck
the
reader
but
the
travellers
by
dover
coaches
are
less
captious
about
pace
than
those
on
most
others
and
now
let
us
fancy
our
friends
up
and
down
shooter
hill
through
dartford
northfleet
and
gravesend
at
which
latter
place
the
first
foreign
symptom
appears
in
words
poste
aux
chevaux
on
the
of
the
inn
and
let
us
imagine
them
bowling
down
rochester
hill
at
a
somewhat
amended
pace
with
the
old
castle
by
the
river
medway
the
towns
of
chatham
strood
and
rochester
full
before
them
and
the
finely
wooded
country
extending
round
in
pleasing
variety
of
hill
and
dale
as
they
reach
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
guard
commences
a
solo
on
his
bugle
to
give
notice
to
the
innkeeper
to
have
the
coach
dinner
on
the
table
all
huddled
together
inside
and
out
long
passengers
and
short
ones
they
cut
across
the
bridge
rattle
along
the
narrow
street
sparking
the
mud
from
the
streets
on
the
shop
windows
and
passengers
on
each
side
and
pull
up
at
the
pig
and
crossbow
with
a
jerk
and
a
dash
as
though
they
had
been
travelling
at
the
rate
of
twelve
miles
an
hour
two
other
coaches
are
dining
while
some
few
passengers
whose
hour
is
not
yet
come
sit
patiently
on
the
roof
or
pace
up
and
down
the
street
with
short
and
hurried
turns
anxious
to
see
the
horses
brought
out
that
are
to
forward
them
on
their
journey
and
what
a
commotion
this
new
arrival
creates
from
the
arched
doorway
of
the
inn
issue
two
one
in
curls
the
other
in
a
cap

with
both
curls
and
a
cap
and
a
ladder
in
his
hand
a
waiter
with
a
dirty
duster
to
count
noses
while
the
neat
landlady
in
a
spruce
black
silk
gown
and
clean
white
apron
stands
smirking
smiling
and
rubbing
her
hands
down
her
sides
inveigling
the
passengers
into
the
house
where
she
will
turn
them
over
to
the
waiters
to
take
their
chance
the
instant
she
gets
them
in
about
the
door
the
usual
idlers
are
a
coachman
out

at

recruits

in

his
boots

for
corns
the
coachman
that
is
to
drive
to
dover
a
youth
in
a
straw
hat
and
a
rowing
shirt
the
little
inquisitive
old
man
of
the
place
who
sees
all
the
midday
coaches
change
horses
speculates
on
the
passengers
and
sees
who
the
parcels
are
for
and
though
last
but
not
least
bangup
the
varmint
man
the
height
of
whose
ambition
is
to
be
taken
for
a
coachman
as
the
coach
pulled
up
he
was
in
the
bar
taking
a
glass
of
cold
sherry
without
and
a
cigar
which
latter
he
brings
out
lighted
in
his
mouth
with
his
shaved
white
hat
stuck
knowingly
on
one
side
and
the
thumbs
of
his
brown
hands
thrust
into
the
of
his
waistcoat
throwing
back
his
single
breasted
fancy
buttoned
green
coat
and
showing
a
cream
coloured
cravat
fastened
with
a
gold
pin
which
with
a
buff
waistcoat
and
tight
drab
trousers
buttoning
over
the
boot
complete
his
toggery
as
he
would
call
it
his
whiskers
are
large
and
riotous
in
the
extreme
while
his
hair
is
clipped
as
close
as
a
charity
schoolboy
the
coachman
and
he
are
on
the
best
of
terms
as
the
outward
twist
of
their
elbows
and
jerks
of
the
head
on
meeting
testify
his
conversation
is
short
and
slangy
accompanied
with
the
correct
nasal
twang
after
standing
and
blowing
a
few
puffs
during
which
time
the
passengers
have
all
alighted
and
the
coachman
has
got
through
the
thick
of
his
business
he
takes
the
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
and
spitting
on
the
flags
addresses
his
friend

he
just
as
jorrocks

was
heard
inside

a
most
tremendous
roar
for
his
pork

the
top

at
the
bottom

to
the

passing
and

put
the
joints
before
the
women
they
are
slow
carvers
while
the
foregoing
scene
was
enacting
outside
our
travellers
had
been
driven
through
the
passage
into
a
little
dark
dingy
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
with
a
dirty
window
looking
against
a
whitewashed
blank
wall
the
table
which
was
covered
with
a
cloth

set
out
with
lumps
of
bread
knives
and
two
and
three
pronged
forks
laid
alternately
altogether
it
was
anything
but
inviting
but
coach
passengers
are
very
complacent

on
the

road
it
matters
little
if
they
are

a
deaf
gentleman
who
has
left
his
trumpet
in
the
coach
meets
an
acquaintance
whom
he
has
not
seen
for
seven
years
and
can
only
shake
hands
and

to
the
movements

a
loud
flourish
on
the
bugle
caused
the
remainder
of
the
gathering
to
be
made
in
dumb
show
and
having
exhausted
his
wind
the
guard
squeezed
through
the
door
and
with
an
extremely
red
face
assured
the
company
that
time
was
hup
and
the
coach
quite
ready

the

up
the

with

an

as
she
hugs
and
kisses
a
youngish
one
at
the
door
who

been

with

for

and
just
at
this
moment
a
coach
is
heard
stealing
up
the
street
upon
which
the
coachman
calls
to
the
to
stand
clear
with
their
cloths
and
take
care
no
one
pays
them
twice
over
gives
a
whistling
hiss
to
his
leaders
the
double
thong
to
his
wheelers
and
starts
off
at
a
trot
muttering
something
about
cuss
coach
passengers
observing
confidentially
to
jorrocks
as
he
turned
the
angle
of
the
street
that
he
would
rather
be
hung
off
a
long
stage
than
die
a
natural
death
on
a
short
one
while
the
guard
drowns
the
voices
of
the
lady
who
has
left
her
reticule
and
of
the
gentleman
who
has
got
no

never

blithely
and
merrily
like
all
coach
passengers
after
feeding
our
party
rolled
steadily
along
with
occasional
gibes
at
those
they
met
or
passed
such
as
telling
waggoners
their
were
out
mates
there
were
nice
lying
on
the
road
making
urchins
follow
the
coach
for
miles
by
holding
up
shillings
and
mock
parcels
or
simple
equestrians
dismount
in
a
jiffy
on
telling
them
their
shoes
were
not
all
on
before
towards
the
decline
of
the
day
dover
heights
appeared
in
view
with
the
stately
castle
guarding
the
channel
which
seen
through
the
clear
atmosphere
of
an
autumnal
evening
with
the
french
coast
conspicuous
in
the
distance
had
more
the
appearance
of
a
wide
river
than
a
branch
of
the
sea
footnote
this
is
more
of
a
joke
than
a
road
one
have
i
all
my
shoes
on
they
are
not
all
on
before
the
coachman
mended
his
pace
a
little
as
he
bowled
along
the
gentle
descents
or
rounded
the
base
of
some
lofty
hill
and
pulling
up
at
lydden
took
a
glass
of
and
brandy
while
four
strapping
greys
with
harness
and
hollyhocks
at
their
heads
were
put
to
to
trot
the
last
few
miles
into
dover
being
near
the
guard
began
to
do
the
amiable
hoped
sprat
had
ridden
comfortable
and
the
coachman
turned
to
the
gentleman
whose
sovereign
was
left
behind
to
assure
him
he
would
bring
his
change
the
next
day
and
was
much
comforted
by
the
assurance
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
italy
for
the
winter
as
the
coach
approached
charlton
gate
the
guard
flourished
his
bugle
and
again
struck
up
which
lasted
the
whole
breadth
of
the
and
length
of
snargate
street
drawing
from
muddle
shop
the
few
loiterers
who
yet
remained
and
causing
mr
le
plastrier
the
patriotic
to
suspend
the
examination
of
the
bowels
of
a
watch
as
they
rattled
past
his
window
at
the
door
of
the
ship
hotel
the
coach
of
wright
the
landlord
with
four
piebald
horses
was
in
waiting
for
him
to
take
his
evening
drive
and
wright
pony
phaeton
with
a
neat
tiger
in
a
blue
and
leathers
was
also
stationed
behind
to
convey
her
a
few
miles
on
the
london
road
of
course
the
equipages
of
such
important
personages
could
not
be
expected
to
move
for
a
common
consequently
it
pulled
up
a
few
yards
from
the
door
it
is
melancholy
to
think
that
so
much
spirit
should
have
gone
unrewarded
or
in
other
words
that
wright
should
have
gone
wrong
in
his
mrs
ramsbottom
said
she
never
understood
the
meaning
of
the
term
the
crown
and
bill
of
rights
wright
until
she
went
to
rochester
many
people
we
doubt
not
retain
a
lively
recollection
of
the
bill
of
wright
of
dover
but
to
our
travellers
now
sir
this
be
dover
that
be
the
ship
i
be
the
coachman
and
we
goes
no
further
observed
the
coachman
in
a
and
to
jorrocks
who
still
kept
his
seat
on
the
box
as
if
he
expected
that
because
they
booked
people
through
to
paris
at
the
coach
office
in
london
that
the
vehicle
crossed
the
channel
and
conveyed
them
on
the
other
side
at
this
intimation
jorrocks
clambered
down
and
was
speedily
surrounded
by
touts
and
captains
of
vessels
soliciting
his
custom
me
lor
said
a
gaunt
french
sailor
in
and
a
jersey
shirt
taking
off
a
red
nightcap
with
mock
politeness
you
shall
be
cross
what
that
about
inquires
jorrocks
cross

does
the
chap

just

the
man

ten
shillings
muttered
jorrocks
vot

the
mouncheer

he
has
picked
my
pocket

said
the
sailor
slowly
using
his
fingers
to
enforce
his
meaning
take
to
france
pointing
south
for
ten
shillin
in
my
me
lor
continued
the
sailor
with
a
grin
of
satisfaction
as
he
saw
jorrocks
began
to
comprehend
him
ah
i
twig
you
take
me
across
the
water
said
our
citizen
chuckling
at
the
idea
of
understanding
french
and
being
called
a
lord
for
ten
shillings
in
fact
do
go
with
him
sir
interrupted
a
english
tar
he
got
nothing
but
a
lousy
lugger
that
will
be
all
in
getting
over
if
it
ever
gets
at
all
and
the
superb
steamer
sails
with
a
messenger
and
dispatches
for
all
the
foreign
courts
at
ten
and
must
be
across
by
twelve
whether
it
can
or
not
please
take
a
card
for
the
quickest
steamer
out
of
dover
wind
made
expressly
to
suit
her
and
she
can
beat
the
like
winking
passengers
never
sick
in
the
most
uproarious
weather
cried
another
tout
running
the
corner
of
his
card
into
jorrocks
eye
to
engage
his
attention
then
came
the
captain
of
the
french
who
was
dressed
much
like
a
new
policeman
with
an
embroidered
collar
to
his
coat
and
a
broad
red
band
round
a
forage
cap
which
he
raised
with
great
politeness
as
he
entreated
jorrocks
patronage
of
his
engine
vich
had
beat
a
balloon
and
vod
take
him
for
half
less
than
noting
a
crowd
collected
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
jorrocks
perfectly
unmoved
with
his
wig
awry
and
his
under
his
arm
gentlemen
said
he
extending
his
right
hand
you
seem
to
me
to
be
desperately
civil
your
purliteness
appears
to
know
no
bounds
but
to
be
candid
with
you
i
beg
to
say
that
whoever
will
carry
me
across
the
herring
pond
cheapest
shall
have
my
custom
so
now
begin
and
bid
downwards
nine
shillings
said
an
englishman
directly
eight
replied
a
frenchman
seven
and
sixpence
seven
shillings
six
and
sixpence
six
shillings
five
and
sixpence
at
last
it
came
down
to
five
shillings
at
which
there
were
two
bidders
the
french
captain
and
the
tout
of
the
and
jorrocks
like
a
true
born
briton
promised
his
patronage
to
the
latter
at
which
the
frenchmen
shrugged
up
their
shoulders
and
burst
out
one
calling
him
my
lor
and
the
other
monsieur
as
they
walked
off
in
search
of
other
victims
none
but
the
natives
of
dover
can
tell
what
the
weather
is
unless
the
wind
comes
directly
off
the
sea
and
it
was
not
until
jorrocks
proceeded
to
embark
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
that
he
ascertained
there
was
a
heavy
swell
on
so
quiet
had
the
heights
kept
the
gambols
of
boreas
three
steamers
were
simmering
into
action
on
the
side
of
the
harbour
in
one
of
which
the
two
britzkas
and
a
barouche
were
lashed
ready
for
sea
while
the
porters
were
trundling
barrows
full
of
luggage
under
the
personal
superintendence
of
a
little
french
commissionnaire
of
wright
in
a
cap
and
the
other
gentry
of
the
same
profession
from
the
different
inns
as
the
lay
nearly
level
with
the
quay
jorrocks
stepped
on
board
without
troubling
himself
to
risk
his
shins
among
the
steps
of
a
ladder
that
was
considerately
thrust
into
the
place
of
embarkation
and
as
soon
as
he
set
foot
upon
deck
of
course
he
was
besieged
by
the
usual
myriad
of
land
sharks
first
came
monsieur
the
commissionnaire
with
his
book
out
of
which
he
enumerated
two
portmanteaus
and
two
for
each
of
which
he
made
a
specific
charge
leaving
his
own
gratuity
optional
with
his
employer
then
came
boots
to
ask
for
something
for
showing
them
the
way
after
him
the
porter
of
the
inn
for
carrying
their
cloaks
and
all
of
which
jorrocks
submitted
to
most
philosophically
but
when
the
interpreter
of
the
deaf
and
dumb
ladder
man
demanded
something
for
the
use
of
the
ladder
his
indignation
got
the
better
of
him
and
he
exclaimed
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
all
on
deck
surely
you
would
charge
a
man
for
what
he
has
not
enjoyed
a
voyage
is
to
many
people
like
taking
an
emetic
they
look
at
the
medicine
and
wish
it
well
over
and
look
at
the
sea
and
wish
themselves
well
over
everything
looked
bright
and
gay
at
dover
the
cliffs
seemed
whiter
than
ever
the
sailors
had
on
clean
trousers
and
the
few
people
that
appeared
in
the
streets
were
dressed
in
their
sunday
best
the
were
seen
feeding
leisurely
on
the
hills
and
there
was
a
placid
calmness
about
everything
on
shore
which
the
travellers
would
fain
have
had
extended
to
the
sea
they
came
slowly
and
solemnly
upon
deck
muffled
up
in
cloaks
and
coats
some
with
their
passage
money
in
their
hands
and
took
their
places
apparently
with
the
full
expectation
of
being
sick
the
french
first
gave
symptoms
of
animation
in
the
shape
of
a
few
vigorous
puffs
from
the
boiler
which
were
responded
to
by
the
whose
rope
was
slipped
without
the
usual
tinkle
of
the
bell
and
she
shot
out
to
sea
closely
followed
by
the
frenchman
who
was
succeeded
by
the
other
english
boat
three
or
four
tremendous
long
protracted
dives
each
followed
by
a
majestic
rise
on
the
bosom
of
the
waves
denoted
the
crossing
of
the
bar
and
just
as
the
creaking
of
the
cordage
the
flapping
of
the
sails
and
the
nervous
quivering
of
the
paddles
as
they
lost
their
hold
of
the
water
were
in
full
vigour
the
mate
crossed
the
deck
with
a
large
white
basin
in
his
hand
the
sight
of
which
turned
the
stomachs
of
half
the
passengers
who
shall
describe
the
misery
that
ensued
the
groans
and
moans
of
the
sufferers
increasing
every
minute
as
the
vessel
heaved
and
dived
and
rolled
and
creaked
while
multiplied
as
passengers
caught
the
green
countenance
and
fixed
eye
of
some
prostrate
sufferer
and
were
overcome
themselves
jorrocks
what
with
his
margate
trips
and
a
most
substantial
breakfast
of
and
porter
tea
eggs
muffins
prawns
and
fried
ham
held
out
as
long
as
anybody
indeed
at
one
time
the
odds
were
that
he
would
not
be
sick
at
all
and
he
kept
walking
up
and
down
deck
like
a
true
british
tar
in
one
of
his
turns
he
was
observed
to
make
a
full
immediately
before
the
boiler
his
eye
caught
a
countenance
that
rose
between
the
top
of
a
blue
camlet
cloak
and
the
bottom
of
a
green
with
a
large
peak
he
was
certain
that
he
knew
it
and
somehow
or
other
he
thought
not
favourably
the
passenger
was
in
that
happy
mood
just
debating
whether
he
should
hold
out
against
sickness
any
longer
or
resign
himself
unreservedly
to
its
horrors
when
jorrocks
eye
encountered
his
and
the
meeting
did
not
appear
to
contribute
to
his
happiness
jorrocks
paused
and
looked
at
him
steadily
for
some
seconds
during
which
time
his
thoughts
made
a
rapid
cast
over
his
memory
sergeant
bumptious
by
gum
exclaimed
he
giving
his
thigh
a
hearty
slap
as
the
deeply
indented
on
the
learned
gentleman
face
betrayed
his
identity
sergeant
said
he
going
up
to
him
i
werry
to
see
ye
may
be
in
the
course
of
your
practice
at
croydon
you
heard
that
there
are
more
times
than
one
to
catch
a
thief
who
are
you
inquired
the
sergeant
with
a
growl
just
at
which
moment
the
boat
gave
a
roll
and
he
wound
up
the
inquiry
by
a
donation
to
the
fishes
who
am
i
replied
jorrocks
as
soon
as
he
was
done
i
soon
tell
ye
that
i
jorrocks
jorrocks
wersus
cheatum
in
fact
now
that
you
have
got
your
bullying
toggery
off
i
be
to
fight
ye
either
by
land
or
sea
groaned
the
sergeant
at
the
mention
of
the
latter
word
and
thereupon
he
put
his
head
over
the
boat
and
paid
his
second
subscription
jorrocks
stood
eyeing
him
and
when
the
sergeant
recovered
he
observed
with
apparent
mildness
and
compassion
now
my
dear
sergeant
to
show
ye
that
i
can
return
good
for
evil
allow
me
to
fatch
you
a
nice
mutton
chop
groaned
the
sergeant
as
though
he
would
die
or
perhaps
you
prefer
a
cut
of
boiled
beef
with
yellow
fat
and
a
dab
of
cabbage
an
alternative
which
was
too
powerful
for
the
worthy
citizen
himself
for
like
sterne
with
his
captive
he
had
drawn
a
picture
that
his
own
imagination
could
not
sustain
and
in
attempting
to
reach
the
side
of
the
boat
he
cascaded
over
the
sergeant
and
they
rolled
over
each
other
senseless
and
helpless
upon
deck
mew
mew
screamed
the
seagulls
creak
creak
went
the
cordage
flop
flop
went
the
sails
round
went
the
white
basins
and
the
steward
with
the
mop
and
few
passengers
would
have
cared
to
have
gone
overboard
when
at
the
end
of
three
hours
misery
the
captain
proclaimed
that
they
were
running
into
still
water
off
boulogne
this
intimation
was
followed
by
the
collection
of
the
passage
money
by
the
mate
and
the
jingling
of
a
tin
box
by
the
steward
under
the
noses
of
the
party
for
perquisites
for
the
crew
jorrocks
and
the
sergeant
lay
together
like
babes
in
the
wood
until
they
were
roused
by
this
operation
when
with
a
parting
growl
at
his
companion
jorrocks
got
up
and
though
he
had
an
idea
in
his
own
mind
that
a
man
had
better
live
abroad
all
his
life
than
encounter
such
misery
as
he
had
undergone
for
the
purpose
of
returning
to
england
he
recollected
his
intended
work
upon
france
and
began
to
make
his
observations
upon
the
town
of
boulogne
towards
which
the
vessel
was
rapidly
steaming
not
half
so
fine
as
margate
said
he
the
houses
seem
all
afraid
of
the
sea
and
turn
their
ends
to
it
instead
of
fronting
it
except
yon
great
white
place
which
i
suppose
is
the
baths
and
taking
his
hunting
telescope
out
of
his
pocket
he
stuck
out
his
legs
and
prepared
to
make
an
observation
how
the
people
are
swarming
down
to
see
us
he
exclaimed
i
see
such
a
load
of
petticoats
glad
j
ai
with
us
may
have
some
fun
here
i
guess
dear
me
wot
lovely
women
wot
ankles
beat
the
english
hollow
would
give
something
to
be
a
single
man
while
he
made
these
remarks
the
boat
ran
up
the
harbour
in
good
style
to
the
evident
gratification
of
the
multitude
who
lined
the
pier
from
end
to
end
and
followed
her
in
her
passage
ease
her
stop
her
at
last
cried
the
captain
as
she
got
opposite
a
low
wooden
midway
down
the
port
a
few
strokes
of
the
paddles
sent
her
up
to
the
quay
some
ropes
were
run
from
each
end
of
the
down
to
the
boat
within
which
space
no
one
was
admitted
except
about
a
dozen
soldiers
or
officers
in
green
coats
white
trousers
black
caps
and
having
swords
by
their
sides
and
some
fisherwomen
with
long
gold
to
lower
the
ladder
for
disembarkation
the
idlers
that
is
to
say
all
the
inhabitants
of
boulogne
range
themselves
outside
the
ropes
on
foot
horseback
in
carriages
or
anyhow
to
take
the
chance
of
seeing
someone
they
know
to
laugh
at
the
melancholy
looks
of
those
who
have
been
sick
and
to
criticise
the
company
who
are
turned
into
the
guarded
space
like
a
flock
of
sheep
before
them
jorrocks
having
scaled
the
ladder
gave
himself
a
hearty
and
congratulatory
shake
on
again
finding
himself
on
terra
firma
and
sticking
his
hat
jauntily
on
one
side
as
though
he
did
know
what
was
proceeded
to
run
his
eye
along
the
spectators
on
one
side
of
the
ropes
when
presently
he
was
heard
to
exclaim
my
vig
there
thompson
he
owes
us
a
hundred
pounds
and
has
been
doing
these
three
years
and
thereupon
he
bolted
up
to
a
fine
looking
young
fellow
with
mustachios
in
a
hussar
foraging
cap
stuck
on
one
side
of
his
head
dressed
in
a
black
velvet
and
with
half
a
jeweller
shop
about
him
in
the
way
of
chains
brooches
rings
and
buttons
who
had
brought
a
bay
horse
to
bear
with
his
chest
against
the
cords
thompson
said
jorrocks
in
a
firm
tone
of
voice
how
are
you
how
do
ye
do
mister
jorrocks
drawled
out
the
latter
taking
a
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
puffing
a
cloud
of
smoke
over
the
grocer
head

few
moments

old

daylight
through
your
carcass
if
you

another
syllable
about
the
bill
why
now
you
stare
as
balaam
did
at
his
ass
when
he
found
it
capable
of
holding
an
argument
with
him
and
true
enough
jorrocks
was
dumbfounded
at
this
sort
of
reply
from
a
creditor
it
not
being
at
all
in
accordance
with
the
or
law
of
merchants
and
quite
unknown
on
before
however
he
had
time
to
recover
his
surprise
all
the
passengers
having
entered
the
roped
area
one
of
the
gentry
gave
him
a
polite
twist
by
the
and
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
bend
of
his
body
beckoned
him
to
proceed
with
the
crowd
into
the
after
passing
an
outer
room
they
entered
the
bureau
by
a
door
in
the
middle
of
a
wooden
partition
where
two
men
were
sitting
with
pens
ready
to
enter
the
names
of
the
arrivers
in
ledgers
votre
nom
et
designation
said
one
of
them
to
jorrocks
who
with
a
bad
start
had
managed
to
squeeze
in
first
to
which
jorrocks
shook
his
head
sare
what
your
name
sare
inquired
the
same
personage
jorrocks
was
the
answer
delivered
with
great
emphasis
and
thereupon
the
secretary
wrote
shorrock
monsieur
shorrock
said
he
looking
up
votre
profession
monsieur
vot
you
are
sare
a
grocer
replied
jorrocks
which
caused
a
titter
from
those
behind
who
meant
to
sink
the
shop
wrote
the
quel
age
monsieur
how
old
you
are
sare
two
pound

replied
jorrocks
surprised
at
his
inquisitiveness
no
sare
not
vot
monnay
you

hot
old
you

sare
well
two
pound
twelve
in
fact
jorrocks
was
then
passed
out
to
take
his
chance
among
the
touts
and
commissionaires
of
the
various
hotels
who
are
enough
to
pull
passengers
to
pieces
in
their
solicitations
for
custom
in
boulogne
however
no
man
with
money
is
ever
short
of
friends
and
thompson
having
given
the
hint
to
two
or
three
acquaintances
as
he
rode
up
street
there
were
no
end
of
sportsmen
levanters
and
gentlemen
who
live
on
the
interest
of
what
they
owe
other
people
waiting
to
receive
jorrocks
the
greetings
on
their
parts
were
most
cordial
and
enthusiastic
and
even
some
who
were
in
his
books
did
not
hesitate
to
hail
him
the
majority
of
the
party
however
was
composed
of
those
with
whom
he
had
at
various
tunes
and
places
enjoyed
the
sports
of
the
field
but
whom
he
had
never
missed
until
they
met
at
boulogne
their
inquiries
were
and
familiar
are
ye
jorrocks
cried
one
holding
out
both
hands
how

on
unexceptionable
personal
security
with
a
power
of
killing
and
selling
your
man

inquired
another

very
convenient
if
they
did
will
you
discount
me
a
bill
at
three
months
is
b
out
of
the
bench
yet
who
do
they
call
nodding
homer
in
your
hunt
oh
gentlemen
gentlemen
cried
jorrocks
go
it
gently
go
it
gently
consider
the
day
is
i
almost
out
of
breath
and
faint
for
want
of
food
i
come
all
the
way
from
as
we
say
in
france
and
lost
my
breakfast
on
the
wogaye
where
is
there
an
inn
where
i
can
recruit
my
famished
frame
what
this
looking
up
at
a
sign
a
boar
in
a
manger
what
does
this
mean
where
my
french
dictionary
i
heard
that
boar
is
very
good
to
eat
yes
but
this
boar
is
to
drink
said
a
friend
on
the
right
but
you
must
not
put
up
at
a
house
of
that
sort
come
to
the
hôtel
where
all
the
best
fellows
and
men
of
consequence
go
a
celebrated
house
in
the
days
of
the
boulogne
hunt
ah
that
was
the
time
jorrocks
we
lived
like
then
you
should
have
been
among
us
such
a
rollicking
set
of
dogs
could
hunt
all
day
race
maggots
and
drink
claret
all
night
and
take
an
occasional
with
the
hounds
on
a
sunday
do
that
with
the
surrey
i
guess
there
the
hôtel
pointing
to
it
as
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
splendid
house
it
is
i
no
interest
in
taking
you
there
do
suppose
so
but
the
sun
of
its
greatness
is
fast
setting
there
no
such
shaking
of
elbows
as
there
used
to
be
the
iou
system
knocked
that
up
still
you
be
very
comfortable
a
bit
of
carpet
by
your
bedside
curtains
to
your
windows
a
to
wash
in
a
clean
towel
every
third
day
and
as
many
friends
to
dine
with
you
as
ever
you
like
no
want
of
company
in
boulogne
i
assure
you
here
w
addressing
the
innkeeper
who
appeared
at
the
door
this
is
the
very
celebrated
jorrocks
of
whom
we
have
all
heard
so
much
take
him
and
use
him
as
you
would
your
own
son
and
hark
ye
aside
do
forget
i
brought
him
garsoon
said
jorrocks
after
having
composed
himself
a
little
during
which
time
he
was
also
composing
a
french
speech
from
his
dictionary
and
madame
de
genlis
du
a
che
hora
ora
si
pranza
looking
at
the
waiter
who
seemed
astonished
oh
stop
said
he
looking
again
that
italian
i
got
hold
of
the
wrong
column
a
quelle
heure
dine
hang
me
if
i
know
how
to
call
this
chap
dine
spelling
it
what
were
you
wishing
to
say
sir
inquired
the
waiter
interrupting
his
display
of
the
language
wot
do
you
speak
english
asked
jorrocks
in
amazement
i
hope
so
sir
replied
the
man
for
i
an
englishman
then
why
the
devil
did
you
not
say
so
you
great
lout
instead
of
putting
me
into
a
sweat
this
day
by
speaking
french
to
you
beg
pardon
sir
thought
you
were
a
frenchman
did
you
indeed
said
jorrocks
delighted
then
by
jove
i
do
speak
french
somehow
or
other
i
thought
i
could
as
i
came
over
bring
me
a
thundering
and
a
pint
of
stout
directly
the
hôtel
being
a
regular
and
sort
of
house
jorrocks
speedily
had
an
immense
stripe
of
tough
beef
and
boiled
potatoes
placed
before
him
in
the
à
and
the
day
being
fine
he
regaled
himself
at
a
table
at
an
open
window
whereby
he
saw
the
smart
and
let
them
view
him
in
return
footnote
for
the
benefit
of
our
readers
we
should
premise
that
madame
de
genlis
work
is
arranged
for
the
convenience
of
travellers
who
do
not
speak
any
language
but
their
own
and
it
consists
of
dialogues
on
different
necessary
subjects
with
french
and
italian
translations
opposite
the
english
sunday
is
a
gay
day
in
france
and
boulogne
equals
the
best
town
in
smartness
the
shops
are
better
set
out
the
women
are
better
dressed
and
there
is
a
holiday
brightness
and
air
of
pleasure
on
every
countenance
then
instead
of
seeing
a
sulky
husband
trudging
behind
a
pouting
wife
with
a
child
in
her
arms
an
infallible
sign
of
a
sunday
evening
in
england
they
trip
away
to
the
rural
where
with
dancing
lemonade
and
love
they
pass
away
the
night
in
temperate
if
not
innocent
hilarity
happy
people
that
once
a
week
at
least
lay
down
their
cares
and
dance
and
sing
and
sport
away
the
weights
of
grievance
which
bow
down
the
spirit
of
other
nations
to
the
earth
the
voyage
though
short
commenced
a
new
era
in
jorrocks
life
and
he
entirely
forget
all
about
sunday
and
dover
dullness
the
moment
he
set
foot
on
sprightly
france
and
he
no
more
recollected
it
was
sunday
than
if
such
a
day
had
ceased
to
exist
in
the
calendar
having
bolted
his
steak
he
gave
his
hessians
their
usual
flop
with
his
handkerchief
combed
his
whiskers
pulled
his
wig
straight
and
sallied
forth
dictionary
in
hand
to
translate
the
signs
admire
the
clever
little
children
talking
french
quiz
the
horses
and
laugh
at
everything
he
did
understand
to
spend
his
first
afternoon
in
short
as
of
the
english
who
go
abroad
are
in
the
habit
of
doing
early
the
next
morning
jorrocks
and
the
yorkshireman
accompanied
by
the
commissionnaire
of
the
hôtel
repaired
to
the
upper
town
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
passports
and
as
they
ascended
the
steep
street
called
la
grand
rue
which
connects
the
two
towns
they
held
a
consultation
as
to
what
the
former
should
be
described
a
would
obtain
jorrocks
no
respect
but
then
he
objected
to
the
word
rentier
what
is
the
french
for
said
he
after
a
thoughtful
pause
turning
to
his
dictionary
there
was
no
such
word
sportsman
then
ay
chasseur
how
would
that
read
john
jorrocks
chasseur
not
bad
i
think
said
he
that
will
do
replied
the
yorkshireman
but
you
must
sink
the
esquire
now
and
tack
before
your
name
and
a
very
pretty
euphonious
sound
jorrocks
will
have
and
when
you
hear
some
of
the
little
parisian
grisettes
lisp
it
out
as
you
turn
the
garters
over
on
their
counters
while
they
turn
their
dark
flashing
eyes
over
upon
you
it
will
be
enough
to
rejuvenate
your
old
frame
but
suppose
we
add
to
of
the
surrey
hunt
by
all
means
replied
jorrocks
delighted
at
the
idea
and
ascending
the
stairs
of
the
consulate
three
steps
at
a
time
the
consul
mons
de
horter
was
in
attendance
sitting
in
state
with
a
gendarme
at
the
door
and
his
secretary
at
his
elbow
monsieur
said
he
bowing
as
jorrocks
passed
through
the
lofty
folding
door
to
which
our
traveller
replied
the
top
of
the
morning
to
you
sir
thinking
something
of
that
sort
would
be
right
the
consul
having
scanned
him
through
his
green
spectacles
drew
a
large
sheet
of
thin
printed
paper
from
his
portfolio
with
the
arms
of
france
placed
under
a
great
petticoat
at
the
top
and
proceeded
to
fill
up
a
request
from
his
most
christian
majesty
to
all
the
authorities
both
civil
and
military
of
france
and
also
of
all
the
allied
pays
de
laisser
librement
passer
monsieur
john
jorrocks
chasseur
and
member
of
the
hont
de
surrey
and
plusieurs
other
honts
and
also
monsieur
stubbs
native
of
angleterre
going
from
boulogne
to
paris
and
to
give
them
aid
and
protection
en
cas
de
besoin
all
of
which
jorrocks
like
many
travellers
before
him
construed
into
a
most
flattering
compliment
and
mark
of
respect
from
his
most
christian
majesty
to
himself
under
the
word
signalement
in
the
margin
the
consul
also
drew
the
following
sketch
of
our
hero
in
order
as
jorrocks
supposed
that
the
king
of
the
mouncheers
might
know
him
when
he
saw
him
age
de

taille
mètre
centimetres
perruque

front
large

moyen

vizage

he
then
handed
it
over
to
jorrocks
for
his
signature
who
observing
the
words
signature
du
porteur
at
the
bottom
passed
it
on
to
the
porter
of
the
inn
until
put
right
by
the
consul
who
on
receiving
his
fee
bowed
him
out
with
great
politeness
great
as
had
been
the
grocer
astonishment
at
the
horses
and
carts
that
he
had
seen
stirring
about
the
streets
his
amazement
knew
no
bounds
when
the
first
paris
diligence
came
rolling
into
town
with
six
horses
spreading
over
the
streets
as
they
swung
about
in
all
directions
covered
with
bells
worsted
balls
and
brushes
driven
by
one
solitary
postilion
on
the
off
wheeler
my
vig
cried
he
here
wombwell
show
what
the
deuce
are
they
doing
in
france
i
not
heard
of
them
since
last
when
i
took
my
brother
joe
children
to
see
them
feed
but
stop
this
is
full
of
men
my
eyes
so
it
is
it
what
young
dutch
sam
would
call
a
male
coach
because
there
are
no
females
about
it
well
i
declare
i
am
almost
sorry
i
did
not
bring
j
wot
would
they
think
to
see
such
a
concern
in
cheapside
why
it
holds
half
a
township
a
perfect
willage
on
wheels
my
eyes
wot
a
curiosity
well
i
never
thought
to
live
to
see
such
a
sight
as
this
wish
it
was
going
our
way
that
i
might
have
a
ride
in
it
hope
ours
will
be
as
big
shortly
after
theirs
did
arrive
and
jorrocks
was
like
a
perfect
child
with
delight
it
was
not
a
male
coach
however
for
in
the
different
compartments
were
five
or
six
ladies
oh
wot
elegant
creatures
cried
he
eyeing
them
i
could
ride
to
jerusalem
with
them
without
being
tired
wot
a
thing
it
is
to
be
a
bachelor
the
conducteur
with
the
usual
frogged
tagged
embroidered
jacket
and
cap
having
hoisted
their
luggage
on
high
the
passengers
who
had
turned
out
of
their
respective
compartments
to
stretch
their
legs
after
their
cramping
from
calais
proceeded
to
resume
their
places
there
were
only
two
seats
vacant
in
the
interior
or
as
jorrocks
called
it
the
middle
house
consequently
the
yorkshireman
and
he
crossed
legs
the
other
four
passengers
had
things
much
coveted
by
french
travellers
on
stubbs
right
sat
an
immense
englishman
enveloped
in
a
dark
blue
camlet
cloak
fastened
with
bronze
lionhead
clasps
a
red
neckcloth
and
a
shabby
napless
brown
hat
his
face
was
large
round
and
red
without
an
atom
of
expression
and
his
little
pig
eyes
twinkled
over
a
sort
of
a
mark
that
denoted
where
his
nose
should
have
been
in
short
his
head
was
more
like
a
barber
wig
block
than
anything
else
and
his
outline
would
have
formed
a
model
of
the
dome
of
paul
on
the
yorkshireman
left
was
a
chattering
young
dragoon
in
a
and
flat
foraging
cap
with
a
flying
tassel
jorrocks
was
more
fortunate
than
his
friend
and
rubbed
sides
with
two
women
one
was
english
either
an
upper
or
an
under
governess
but
who
might
be
safely
trusted
to
travel
by
herself
she
was
dressed
in
a
black
beaver
bonnet
lined
with
scarlet
silk
a
nankeen
pelisse
with
a
blue
ribbon
and
boots
and
she
carried
a
sort
of
small
on
her
knee
with
a
plain
christian
prayer
book
on
the
top
the
other
was
french
approaching
to
middle
age
with
a
nice
smart
plump
figure
good
eyes
a
beautiful
foot
and
ankle
and
very
well
dressed
indeed
her
dress
very
materially
reduced
the
appearance
of
her
age
and
she
was
what
the
milliners
would
call
remarkably
well
got
up
her
bonnet
was
a
pink
satin
with
a
white
blonde
ruche
surmounted
by
a
rich
blonde
veil
with
a
white
rose
placed
elegantly
on
one
side
and
her
glossy
auburn
hair
pressed
down
the
sides
of
a
forehead
in
the
madonna
her
pelisse
was
of
figured
silk
worn
with
a
black
velvet
pelerine
and
a
handsomely
embroidered
collar
her
boots
were
of
a
colour
to
match
the
pelisse
and
a
massive
gold
chain
round
her
neck
and
a
solitary
pearl
ring
on
a
middle
finger
were
all
the
jewellery
she
displayed
jorrocks
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
foot
and
ankle
as
she
mounted
the
steps
to
resume
her
place
in
the
diligence
and
pushing
the
yorkshireman
aside
he
bundled
in
directly
after
her
and
took
up
the
place
we
have
described
the
vehicle
was
soon
in
motion
and
its
ponderous
roll
enchanted
the
heart
of
the
grocer
independently
of
the
novelty
he
was
in
a
humour
to
be
pleased
and
everything
with
him
was
de
not
so
the
yorkshireman
neighbour
who
lounged
in
the
corner
muffled
up
in
his
cloak
muttering
and
cursing
at
every
jolt
of
the
diligence
as
it
bumped
across
the
gutters
and
jolted
along
the
streets
of
boulogne
at
length
having
got
off
the
pavement
after
crushing
along
at
a
trot
through
the
soft
road
that
immediately
succeeds
they
reached
the
little
hill
near
gooseman
farm
and
the
horses
gradually
relaxed
into
a
walk
when
he
burst
forth
with
a
tremendous
oath
swearing
that
he
had
travelled
three
hundred
thousand
miles
and
never
saw
horses
walk
up
such
a
bit
of
a
bank
before
he
looked
round
the
diligence
in
the
expectation
of
someone
joining
him
but
no
one
deigned
a
reply
so
with
a
growl
and
a
jerk
of
his
shoulders
he
again
threw
himself
into
his
corner
the
dragoon
and
the
french
lady
then
began
narrating
the
histories
of
their
lives
as
the
french
people
always
do
and
jorrocks
and
the
yorkshireman
sat
looking
at
each
other
at
length
jorrocks
pulling
his
dictionary
and
de
out
of
his
pocket
observed
i
quite
forgot
to
ask
the
guard
at
what
time
we
dine
most
important
consideration
for
i
hold
it
unfair
to
takes
stomach
by
surprise
and
a
man
should
have
due
notice
that
he
may
tune
his
appetite
accordingly
i
have
always
thought
that
there
as
much
dexterity
required
to
bring
an
appetite
to
table
in
the
full
bloom
of
perfection
as
there
is
in
training
an
to
run
on
a
particular
let
me
see
added
he
turning
over
the
pages
of
it
will
be
under
the
head
of
eating
and
drinking
i
here
it
is

said
the
french

smiling
with
the
greatest
good
nature
upon
him
a
marble
said
jorrocks
wot
does
that
mean

jorrocks
with

bow
i

proud
of
your
praise
and
your
english

quite

said
he
to
the
yorkshireman
with
a
most
grin
you
were
right
in
what
you
told
me
about
the
gals
calling
me
i
declare
she
driven
right
home
to
my
transfixed
me
at
once
in
fact
everyone
who
has
done
a
little
voyaging
as
they
call
it
in
france
knows
that
a
few
miles
to
the
south
of
samer
rises
a
very
steep
hill
across
which
the
route
lies
and
that
diligence
travellers
are
generally
invited
to
walk
up
it
a
path
which
strikes
off
near
the
foot
of
the
hill
across
the
open
cuts
off
the
angle
and
diligences
being
anything
but
what
the
name
would
imply
the
passengers
by
availing
themselves
of
the
short
cut
have
ample
time
for
striking
up
confabs
and
inquiring
into
the
comforts
of
the
occupiers
of
the
various
compartments
our
friends
of
the
interior
were
all
busy
jabbering
and
talking
some
with
their
tongues
others
with
their
hands
and
tongues
with
the
exception
of
the
monster
in
the
cloak
who
sat
like
a
sack
in
the
corner
until
the
horses
having
reached
the
breathing
place
made
a
dead
halt
and
the
conducteur
proceeded
to
invite
the
party
to
descend
and
promenade
up
the
hill
happened
now
cried
the
monster
jumping
up
as
the
door
opened
surely
they
do
expect
us
to
walk
up
this
mountain
i
travelled
three
hundred
thousand
miles
and
was
never
asked
to
do
such
a
thing
in
all
my
life
before
i
wo
do
it
i
paid
for
riding
and
ride
i
will
you
are
all
a
set
of
infamous
cheats
said
he
to
the
conducteur
in
good
plain
english
but
the
conducteur
not
understanding
the
language
shut
the
door
as
soon
as
all
the
rest
were
out
and
let
him
roll
on
by
himself
jorrocks
stuck
to
his
woman
who
had
a
negro
boy
in
the
rotonde
dressed
in
baggy
trousers
with
a
green
waistcoat
and
a
blue
coat
with
a
coronet
on
the
button
who
came
to
hand
her
out
and
was
addressed
by
the
heroic
name
of
agamemnon
jorrocks
got
a
glimpse
of
the
button
but
not
understanding
foreign
coronets
thought
it
was
a
crest
nevertheless
he
thought
he
might
as
well
inquire
who
his
friend
was
so
slinking
back
as
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
he
got
hold
of
the
nigger
and
asked
what
they
called
his
missis
massa
did
not
understand
and
jorrocks
sorely
puzzled
how
to
explain
again
had
recourse
to
the
du
but
madame
de
genlis
had
not
anticipated
such
an
occurrence
and
there
was
no
dialogue
adapted
to
his
situation
there
was
a
conversation
with
a
lacquey
however
commencing
with
are
you
disposed
to
enter
into
my
service
and
in
the
hopes
of
hitting
upon
something
that
would
convey
his
wishes
he
hark
forward
and
passing
by
are
you
married
arrived
at
what
is
your
wife
occupation
que
fait
votre
femme
said
he
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
and
pointing
to
madame
agamemnon
showed
his
ivories
as
he
laughed
at
the
idea
of
jorrocks
calling
his
mistress
his
wife
and
by
signs
and
words
conveyed
to
him
some
idea
of
the
importance
of
the
personage
to
whom
he
alluded
this
he
did
most
completely
for
before
the
diligence
came
up
jorrocks
pulled
the
yorkshireman
aside
and
asked
if
he
was
aware
that
they
were
travelling
with
a
real
live
countess
madame
la
countess
benwolio
the
nigger
informs
me
said
he
a
werry
grande
femme
though
what
that
means
i
do
know
oh
countesses
are
common
enough
here
replied
the
yorkshireman
i
dare
say
she
a
i
remember
a
who
had
a
german
baron
for
a
once
oh
said
jorrocks
you
are
jealous
you
always
try
to
run
down
my
friends
but
that
wo
do
i
wide
awake
to
your
tricks
so
saying
he
shuffled
off
and
getting
hold
of
the
countess
helped
agamemnon
to
hoist
her
into
the
diligence
he
was
most
insinuating
for
the
next
two
hours
and
jabbered
about
love
and
admiring
the
fine
flat
open
country
and
the
absence
of
hedges
and
flints
but
as
neither
youth
nor
age
can
subsist
on
love
alone
his
confounded
appetite
began
to
trouble
him
and
got
quite
the
better
of
him
before
they
reached
abbeville
every
mile
seemed
a
league
and
he
had
his
head
out
of
the
window
at
least
twenty
times
before
they
came
in
sight
of
the
town
at
length
the
diligence
got
its
slow
length
dragged
not
only
to
abbeville
but
to
the
sign
of
the
fidèle
berger
or
fiddle
burgur
as
jorrocks
pronounced
it
where
they
were
to
dine
the
door
being
opened
out
he
jumped
and
with
his
du
in
one
hand
and
the
countess
benvolio
in
the
other
he
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
of
pauvres
misérables
congregated
under
the
gateway
who
exhibited
every
species
of
disease
and
infirmity
that
poor
human
nature
is
liable
or
heir
to
and
entered
the
hotel
the
sally
manger
as
he
called
it
was
a
long
room
on
the
basement
with
a
white
stove
at
one
end
and
the
walls
plentifully
decorated
with
a
panoramic
view
of
the
grand
nation
wallopping
the
spaniards
at
the
siege
of
saragossa
the
diligence
being
a
leetle
behind
time
as
usual
the
soup
was
on
the
table
when
they
entered
the
passengers
quickly
ranged
themselves
round
and
with
his
mouth
watering
as
the
female
garçon
lifted
the
cover
from
the
tureen
jorrocks
sat
in
the
expectation
of
seeing
the
rich
contents
ladled
into
the
plates
his
countenance
fell
fifty
per
cent
as
the
first
spoonful
passed
before
his
my
vig
why

exclaimed
he

the
city

the
fat
man
sending
his
plate
from
him
in
disgust
and
never
tasted

a
mess
as
this
before

and
yet
what
a
dialogue

is
oh
heavens

your
poor

but
one
request
and
that
is

would
have
made
for
me
oh

oh
dear
i
shall
die
of
hunger
i
see
i
shall
die
of
absolute
famine
my
stomach
thinks
my
throat
cut
already
in
the
height
of
his
distress
in
came
two
turkeys
and
a
couple
of
fowls
and
his
countenance
shone
forth
like
an
april
sun
after
a
shower
come
this
is
better
said
he
i
trouble
you
sir
for

the
day
in
looking

the
dinner
dialogue
well
here
something
to

purpose

no
nor
a
great
bit

le

here
the
countess
benvolio
who
had
been
playing
a
good
knife
and
fork
herself
pricked
up
her
ears
and
guessing
at
jorrocks
wants
interceded
with
her
countryman
and
got
him
a
plateful
of
fowl
it
was
soon
disposed
of
however
and
half
a
dish
of
hashed
hare
or
cat
that
was
placed
within
reach
of
him
shortly
after
was
quickly
transferred
into
his
plate
a
french
dinner
is
admirably
calculated
for
leading
the
appetite
on
by
easy
stages
to
the
grand
consummation
of
satiety
it
begins
meagrely
as
we
have
shown
and
proceeds
gradually
through
the
various
gradations
of
lights
savories
solids
and
substantiate
presently
there
was
a
large
dish
of
stewed
eels
put
on
what
that
asked
jorrocks
of
the
poisson
was
the
reply
poison
why
you
infidel
have
you
no
conscience
fishe
said
the
countess
oh
ay
i
smell
eels
just
like
what
we
have
at
the

twickenham
your

i
am
thirsty

ah
bon
said
the
countess
laughing
and
giving
him
a
tumbler
of
claret
i
travelled
three
hundred
thousand
miles
said
the
fat
man
and
never
saw
claret
drunk
in
that
way
before
it
not
werry
good
i
think
said
jorrocks
smacking
his
lips
if
it
was
not
claret
i
would
sooner
drink
port
some
wild
ducks
and
fricandeau
de
veau
which
followed
were
cut
up
and
handed
round
jorrocks
helping
himself
plentifully
to
both
as
also
to
pommes
de
terre
à
la
maitre
and
bread
at
discretion
faith
but
this
is
not
a
bad
dinner
after
all
said
and
done
when
one
gets
fairly
into
it
fear
it
will
be
very
expensive
observed
the
fat
man
just
when
jorrocks
began
to
think
he
had
satisfied
nature
in
came
a
roast
leg
of
mutton
a

the

have
another

i

these
chaps
said
he
eyeing
them
and
looking
into
madame
de
book
un
verre

holding
up
the
book
and
pointing
to
the
sentence
he
again
set
to
and
went
a
good
one
at
both
mutton
and
snipes
but
on
pulling
up
he
appeared
somewhat
exhausted
he
had
not
got
through
it
all
yet
however
just
as
he
was
taking
breath
a
entered
with
some
custards
and
an
enormous
omelette

whose
puffy
brown
sides
bagged
over
the
tin

that
contained
it
there
a

cried
jorrocks

lord
mayor

know
i
shall
be

but
however
here
goes
sending
his
plate
across
the
table
to
the
who
was
going
to
help
it
the
first
dive
of
the
spoon
undeceived
him
as
he
heard
it
sound
at
the
bottom
of
the
dish

what

setting
the
dessert

removed
and
here

well
now
i
travelled
three
hundred
thousand
miles
and
never
heard
such
a
bit
of
french
as
that
before
said
the
fat
man
chuckling
ix
jorrocks
in
paris
as
the
grey
morning
mist
gradually
dispersed
and
daylight
began
to
penetrate
the
cloud
that
dimmed
the
four
squares
of
glass
composing
the
windows
of
the
diligence
the
yorkshireman
and
took
a
mental
survey
of
his
before
him
sat
his
worthy
friend
snoring
away
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
head
which
kept
bobbing
over
on
to
the
shoulder
of
the
countess
enveloped
in
the
ample
folds
of
a
white
cotton
she
too
was
asleep
and
disarmed
of
all
her
daylight
arts
dozed
away
in
tranquil
security
her
mouth
also
was
open
exhibiting
rather
a
moderate
set
of
teeth
and
her
madonna
front
having
got
exposed
a
mixture
of
brown
and
hairs
at
the
parting
place
her
bonnet
swung
from
the
roof
of
the
diligence
and
its
place
was
supplied
by
a
handsome
lace
cap
fastened
under
her
chin
by
a
cambric
handkerchief
presently
the
sun
rose
and
a
bright
ray
shooting
into
the
corner
awoke
her
with
a
start
and
after
a
hurried
glance
at
the
passengers
who
appeared
to
be
all
asleep
she
drew
a
small
from
her
bag
and
proceeded
to
examine
her
features
jorrocks
awoke
shortly
after
and
with
an
awful
groan
exclaimed
that
his
backbone
was
fairly
worn
out
with
sitting
oh
dear
said
he
my
behind
aches
as
if
i
had
been
kicked
all
the
way
from
hockleyhole
to
marylebone
are
we
near
paris
for
i
sure
i
ca
find
seat
any
longer
indeed
i
ca
i
rather
ride
two
hundred
miles
in
nine
hours
like
than
be
shut
up
in
this
woiture
another
hour
it
really
is
past
bearing
and
that
the
long
and
short
of
the
matter
this
exclamation
roused
all
the
party
who
began
yawning
and
rubbing
their
eyes
and
looking
at
their
watches
the
windows
also
were
lowered
to
take
in
fresh
air
and
on
looking
out
they
found
themselves
rolling
along
a
sandy
road
lined
on
each
side
with
whose
branches
were
groaning
with
fruit
they
breakfasted
at
beaumont
and
had
a
regular
spread
of
fish
a
large
joint
of
hot
roast
veal
roast
chickens
several
yards
of
sour
bread
grapes
peaches
pears
and
plums
with
vin
ordinaire
and
coffee
au
lait
but
jorrocks
was
off
his
feed
and
stood
all
the
time
to
ease
his
haunches
towards
three
in
the
afternoon
they
caught
the
first
glimpse
of
the
gilded
dome
of
the
hospital
of
invalids
which
was
a
signal
for
all
the
party
to
brush
up
and
make
themselves
agreeable
even
the
miler
opened
out
and
began
telling
some
wonderful
anecdotes
while
the
countess
and
jorrocks
carried
on
a
fierce
flirtation
or
whatever
else
they
pleased
to
call
it
at
last
after
a
deal
of
jargon
he
broke
off
by
appealing
to
the
yorkshireman
to
know
what
inn
they
should
put
up
at
in
paris
i
do
know
sure
said
he
it
depends
a
good
deal
upon
how
you
mean
to
live
as
you
pay
my
shot
it
does
not
do
for
beggars
to
be
choosers
but
suppose
we
try
meurice
oh
no
replied
jorrocks
her
ladyship
tells
me
it
is
werry
expensive
for
the
english
always
pay
through
the
nose
if
they
go
to
english
houses
in
paris
and
as
we
talk
french
we
can
put
up
at
a
french
one
you
know
well
then
we
can
try
one
of
the
french
ones
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
rue
de
la
pay
no
by
jove
that
wo
do
for
me
the
werry
name
is
enough
no
rue
de
la
pay
for
me
at
least
if
i
have
to
pay
the
shot
well
then
you
must
get
your
friend
there
to
tell
you
of
some
place
for
i
do
care
twopence
as
long
as
i
have
a
bed
where
it
is
the
countess
and
he
then
laid
their
heads
together
again
and
when
the
diligence
stopped
to
change
horses
at
denis
jorrocks
asked
the
yorkshireman
to
alight
and
taking
him
aside
announced
with
great
glee
that
her
ladyship
finding
they
were
strangers
in
the
land
had
most
kindly
invited
them
to
stay
with
her
and
that
she
had
a
most
splendid
house
in
the
rue
des
ornamented
with
mirrors
musical
clocks
and
he
did
know
what
and
kept
the
best
company
in
all
france
marquesses
barons
viscounts
authors
etc
before
the
yorkshireman
had
time
to
reply
the
conducteur
came
and
hurried
them
back
into
the
diligence
and
closed
the
door
with
a
bang
to
be
sure
of
having
his
passengers
there
while
he
and
the
postilion
shuffled
the
cards
and
cut
for
a
glass
of
apiece
the
countess
suspecting
what
they
had
been
after
resumed
the
conversation
as
soon
as
jorrocks
was
you
shall
manger
cinque
fois
every
day
said
she
cinque
fois
she
humph
said
jorrocks
to
himself
what
can
that
mean
cank
four
four
times
five
twenty
eat
twenty
times
a
day
not
possible
oui
monsieur
cinque

repeated
the
countess
telling
the
number
off
on
her
fingers
café
at
nine
of
the
matin

la
fourchette
at

at

café
at
six
hour
and
souper
at
neuf
hour
upon
my
word
replied
jorrocks
his
eyes
sparkling
with
pleasure
your
offer
is
werry
inwiting
my
lady
said
he
bowing
before
her
je
suis
i
am
much
flattered
and
monsieur
said
she
looking
at
the
yorkshireman
he
too
assured
her
that
he
was
very
much
flattered
and
was
beginning
to
excuse
himself
when
the
countess
interrupted
him
somewhat
abruptly
by
turning
to
jorrocks
and
saying
he
sall
be
your
son
ce
pas
no
my
lady
i
no
children
replied
he
and
the
countess
eyes
in
their
turn
underwent
a
momentary
illumination
the
parisian
barrier
was
soon
reached
and
the
man
taken
up
to
kick
about
the
jaded
travellers
luggage
at
the
journey
end
while
this
operation
was
going
on
in
the
diligence
yard
the
countess
stuck
close
to
jorrocks
and
having
dispatched
agamemnon
for
a
fiacre
bundled
him
in
luggage
and
all
and
desiring
her
worthy
domestic
to
mount
the
box
and
direct
the
driver
she
kissed
her
hand
to
the
yorkshireman
assuring
him
she
would
be
most
happy
to
see
him
in
proof
of
which
she
drove
away
without
telling
him
her
number
or
where
the
rue
des
was
paris
is
a
charming
place
after
the
heat
of
the
summer
has
passed
away
and
the
fine
clear
autumnal
days
arrive
then
is
the
time
to
see
the
tuileries
gardens
to
perfection
when
the
parisians
have
returned
from
their
châteaus
and
emigrating
english
and
those
homeward
bound
halt
to
renovate
on
the
road
then
is
the
time
that
the
gayest
plants
put
forth
their
brightest
hues
and
drooping
orange
flowers
scent
the
air
which
silvery
fountains
lend
their
aid
to
cool
on
a
sunday
afternoon
such
as
we
have
described
our
friend
stubbs
who
since
his
arrival
had
been
living
very
comfortably
at
the
hôtel
in
expectation
of
jorrocks
paying
his
bill
indulged
in
six
sous
worth
of
chairs
one
to
sit
upon
and
one
for
each
leg
and
john
stretched
himself
out
in
the
shade
beneath
the
lofty
trees
to
view
the
gay
groups
who
promenaded
the
alleys
before
him
first
there
came
a
helmeted
cuirassier
with
his
wife
in
blue
satin
and
a
little
boy
in
his
hand
in
uniform
with
a
wooden
sword
a
perfect
miniature
of
the
father
then
a
group
of
shuffling
french
women
each
with
an
italian
greyhound
in
slips
followed
by
an
awkward
englishman
with
a
sister
on
each
arm
all
stepping
out
like
grenadiers
then
came
a
ribbon
chevalier
of
the
legion
of
honour
whose
hat
was
oftener
in
his
hand
than
on
his
head
followed
by
a
nondescript
looking
militaire
with
fierce
mustachios
in
shining
white
leathers
and
a
sort
of
italian
military
cloak
with
one
side
thrown
over
the
shoulder
to
exhibit
the
wearer
leg
and
the
bright
scabbard
of
a
large
sword
while
on
the
hero
left
arm
hung
a
splendidly
dressed
woman
what
a
figure
said
the
yorkshireman
to
himself
as
they
came
before
him
and
he
took
another
good
yet
stay
no
impossible
gracious
heaven
it
ca
be
and
yet
it
is
by
jove
it
jorrocks
why
now
you
old
imbecile
cried
he
jumping
off
his
chairs
and
running
up
to
him
what
are
you
after
bursting
into
a
loud
laugh
as
he
looked
at
jorrocks
mustachios
a
pair
of
great
false
ones
is
there
no
piece
of
tomfoolery
too
great
for
you
what
come
across
you
now
where
the
deuce
did
you
get
these
things
taking
hold
of
the
curls
at
one
side
of
his
mustachios
how
now
roared
jorrocks
with
rage
and
astonishment
how
now
ye
young
scaramouch
vot
do
you
mean
by
insulting
a
gentleman
sportsman
in
broad
daylight
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
of
quality
by
jingo
added
he
his
eyes
sparkling
with
rage
if
you
are
not
off
before
i
can
say
i
run
you
through
the
gizzard
and
give
your
miserable
carcass
to
the
dogs
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
and
groping
under
his
cloak
for
the
hilt
of
his
a
crowd
collected
and
the
yorkshireman
perceiving
symptoms
of
a
scene
slunk
out
of
the
mêlée
and
jorrocks
after
an
indignant
shake
or
two
of
his
feathers
and
curl
of
his
mustachios
pursued
his
course
up
the
gardens
this
was
the
first
time
they
had
met
since
their
arrival
which
was
above
a
week
before
indeed
it
was
nine
days
for
the
landlord
of
the
house
where
the
yorkshireman
lived
had
sent
his
little
bill
two
days
before
this
it
being
an
established
rule
of
his
house
and
one
which
was
conspicuously
posted
in
all
the
rooms
that
the
bills
were
to
be
settled
weekly
and
stubbs
had
that
very
morning
observed
that
the
hat
of
monsieur
was
not
raised
half
so
high
from
his
head
nor
his
body
inclined
so
much
towards
the
ground
as
it
was
wont
to
be
a
pretty
significant
hint
that
he
wanted
his
now
the
yorkshireman
among
his
other
accomplishments
had
a
turn
for
play
and
unfortunately
had
been
at
the
salon
the
night
before
when
after
continuous
run
of
he
came
away
twelve
francs
below
the
amount
of
the
bill
consequently
a
rumpus
with
jorrocks
could
not
have
taken
place
at
a
more
unfortunate
moment
thinking
however
a
good
night
rest
or
two
might
settle
him
down
and
put
all
matters
right
he
let
things
alone
until
the
tuesday
following
when
again
finding
monsieur
little
memoire
on
one
side
of
his
coffeecup
and
a
framed
copy
of
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
house
on
the
other
he
felt
constrained
to
take
some
decisive
step
towards
its
liquidation
accordingly
having
breakfasted
he
combed
his
hair
straight
over
his
face
and
putting
on
a
very
penitential
look
called
a
cab
and
desired
the
man
to
drive
him
to
the
rue
des
after
zigzagging
twisting
and
turning
about
in
various
directions
they
at
last
jingled
to
the
end
of
a
very
narrow
street
whose
unswept
pavement
had
not
been
cheered
by
a
ray
of
sunshine
since
the
houses
were
built
it
was
excessively
narrow
and
there
were
no
flags
on
either
side
but
through
the
centre
ran
a
dribbling
stream
here
and
there
obstructed
by
or
vegetable
refuse
as
the
water
had
served
as
a
plaything
for
children
or
been
stopped
by
servants
for
domestic
purposes
the
street
being
extremely
old
of
course
the
houses
were
very
large
forming
as
all
houses
do
in
paris
little
squares
entered
by
folding
doors
at
one
side
of
which
in
a
sort
of
lodge
lives
the
porter
parlez
au
portier
who
receives
letters
parcels
and
communications
for
the
several
occupiers
consisting
sometimes
of
twenty
or
thirty
different
establishments
in
one
house
from
this
functionary
may
be
learned
the
names
of
the
different
tenants
having
dismissed
his
cab
the
yorkshireman
entered
the
first
gateway
on
his
left
to
take
the
chance
of
gaining
some
intelligence
of
the
countess
the
porter
a
cobbler
by
trade
was
hammering
away
last
on
knee
at
the
sole
of
a
shoe
and
with
a
grin
on
his
countenance
informed
the
yorkshireman
that
the
countess
lived
next
door
but
one
a
thrill
of
fear
came
over
him
on
finding
himself
so
near
the
residence
of
his
indignant
friend
but
it
was
of
momentary
duration
and
he
soon
entered
the
courtyard
of
no
where
he
was
directed
by
an
unshaved
porter
to
proceed
un
troisième
and
ring
the
bell
at
the
door
on
the
side
obedient
to
his
directions
the
yorkshireman
proceeded
to
climb
a
wide
but
dirty
stone
staircase
with
carved
and
gilded
balusters
whose
wall
and
steps
had
known
no
water
for
many
years
and
at
length
found
himself
on
the
landing
opposite
the
very
apartment
which
contained
the
redoubtable
jorrocks
here
he
stood
for
a
few
seconds
breathing
and
cooling
himself
after
his
exertions
during
which
time
he
pictured
to
himself
the
worthy
citizen
immersed
in
papers
deeply
engaged
in
the
preparation
of
his
france
in
three
volumes
and
wished
that
the
first
five
minutes
of
their
interview
were
over
at
length
he
mustered
courage
to
grasp
a
red
tassel
and
give
a
gentle
tinkle
to
the
bell
the
door
was
quickly
opened
by
agamemnon
in
dirty
loose
trousers
and
slippers
and
without
a
coat
he
recognised
his
and
in
answer
to
his
inquiry
if
monsieur
jorrocks
was
at
home
grinned
and
answered
oh
oui
certainement
monsieur
le
colonel
jorrockes
est
ici
and
motioned
him
to
come
in
the
yorkshireman
entered
the
little
a
sort
of
scullery
full
of
mops
pans
dirty
shoes
dusters
candlesticks
and
the
first
thing
that
caught
his
eye
was
sword
which
agamemnon
had
been
burnishing
up
with
sandpaper
and
leather
lying
on
a
table
before
the
window
this
was
not
very
encouraging
but
agamemnon
gave
no
time
for
reflection
and
opening
half
a
light
folding
door
directly
opposite
the
one
by
which
he
entered
the
yorkshireman
passed
through
unannounced
and
unperceived
by
jorrocks
or
the
countess
who
were
completely
absorbed
in
a
game
of
dominoes
sitting
on
opposite
sides
of
a
common
deal
table
whose
silk
cover
was
laid
over
the
back
of
a
chair
jorrocks
was
sitting
on
a
stool
with
his
back
to
the
door
and
the
countess
being
very
intent
on
the
game
stubbs
had
time
for
a
hasty
survey
of
the
company
and
apartment
before
she
looked
up
it
was
about
one
and
of
course
she
was
still
with
her
nightcap
on
a
loose
de
of
flannel
and
a
flaming
scotch
shawl
thrown
over
her
shoulders
and
slippers
on
her
feet
jorrocks
had
his
leather
pantaloons
on
with
a
rich
blue
and
yellow
brocade
and
blue
morocco
slippers
to
match
his
to
which
he
had
added
a
pair
of
regimental
were
airing
before
a
stove
which
contained
the
dying
embers
of
a
small
log
the
room
was
low
and
contained
the
usual
allowance
of
red
figured
chairs
with
brass
nails
the
window
curtains
were
on
rings
and
gilded
rods
a
secretaire
stood
against
one
of
the
walls
and
there
was
a
large
mirror
above
the
marble
mantelpiece
which
supported
a
clock
surmounted
by
a
flying
cupid
and
two
vases
of
artificial
flowers
covered
with
glass
on
one
of
which
was
placed
an
elegant
bonnet
of
the
newest
and
most
approved
fashion
the
floor
of
highly
polished
oak
was
strewed
about
with
playbills
slippers
boxes
cards
dice
ribbons
dirty
handkerchiefs
etc
and
on
one
side
of
the
deal
table
was
a
plate
containing
five
bones
and
hard
by
lay
jorrocks
mustachios
and
a
dirty
small
just
as
the
yorkshireman
had
got
thus
far
in
his
survey
the
countess
gave
the
finishing
stroke
to
the
game
and
jorrocks
jumping
up
in
a
rage
gave
his
leathers
such
a
slap
as
sent
a
cloud
of
flying
into
his
face
vous
avez
the
devil
own
luck
exclaimed
he
repeating
the
blow
when
to
avoid
the
cloud
he
turned
short
round
and
encountered
the
yorkshireman
how
now
roared
he
at
the
top
of
his
voice
who
sent
for
you
have
you
come
here
to
insult
me
in
my
own
house
i
lay
my
soul
to
an

the
yorkshireman
very
mildly
pray

yourself
into
a
passion
consider
the
lady
and
let
us
have
any
unpleasantness
in
madame
la
duchesse

making
her
a
very
low
bow
as
he
spoke
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
heart
d

displeasancies
roared
jorrocks
and
that
swearing
a
thing

of

screamed
the

out
of
the
window
police

bellowed
agamemnon
from
the
next
one
police
police
police
the
grisly
porter
down
below
and
before
they
had
time
to
reflect
on
what
had
passed
a
sergeant
file
of
the
national
guard
had
entered
the
hotel
mounted
the
stairs
and
taken
possession
of
the
apartment
the
sight
of
the
soldiers
with
their
bright
bayonets
all
fixed
and
gleaming
as
they
were
cooled
courage
in
an
instant
and
after
standing
a
few
seconds
in
petrified
astonishment
he
made
a
dart
at
his
and
bolted
out
of
the
room
the
countess
benvolio
then
unlocked
her
secretaire
in
which
was
a
plated
with
bottles
and
glasses
out
of
which
she
poured
the
sergeant
three
and
the
privates
two
glasses
each
of
pure
after
which
agamemnon
showed
them
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
less
than
ten
minutes
all
was
quiet
again
and
the
yorkshireman
was
occupying
jorrocks
stool
the
countess
then
began
putting
things
a
little
in
order
adorned
the
deal
table
with
the
cover
before
doing
which
she
swept
off
jorrocks
mustachios
and
thrust
a
dirty
white
handkerchief
and
the
small
under
the
cushion
of
a
chair
while
agamemnon
carried
away
the
plate
with
the
bones
ah
le
pauvre

said
the
countess
eyeing
the
bones
as
they
passed
he

i
think
thus
she
went
rattling
on
telling
the
yorkshireman
all
sorts
of
stories
about
the
colonel
whom
she
seemed
ready
to
change
for
a
younger
piece
of
goods
with
a
more
moderate
appetite
and
finding
stubbs
more
complaisant
than
he
had
been
in
the
diligence
she
concluded
by
proposing
that
he
should
accompany
the
colonel
and
herself
to
a
that
evening
at
a
friend
of
hers
another
countess
in
the
rue
des
being
disengaged
as
usual
he
at
once
assented
on
condition
that
the
countess
would
effect
a
reconciliation
between
jorrocks
and
himself
for
which
purpose
she
at
once
repaired
to
his
room
and
presently
reappeared
with
our
late
outrageously
indignant
hero
the
colonel
had
been
occupying
his
time
at
the
toilette
and
was
grand
finely
cleaned
leathers
and
brass
spurs
with
a
spick
and
span
new
blue
military
hooking
and
eyeing
up
to
the
chin
and
all
covered
with
braid
frogs
tags
and
buttons

exclaimed
the
countess
turning
him
round
after
having
led
him
into
the
middle
of
the
room
dat

replied
jorrocks
raising
his
arms
as

to
take

but
it
is
rather
tight
partiklarly
round
the
waist
should
like
to
dine
in
it
what

think
of

turning
round
and
addressing

yorkshireman

then
they

anxious
for

to

that
they
make
parties
expressly

but
instead

a
countess
of
werry
great
consequence
and
as

back

and
perhaps
we
may
do
something
between
us
this
being
all
arranged
stubbs
took
his
departure
and
jorrocks
having
girded
on
his
sword
and
the
countess
having
made
her
morning
toilette
they
proceed
to
their
daily
promenade
in
the
tuileries
gardens
a
little
before
nine
that
evening
the
yorkshireman
again
found
himself
toiling
up
the
dirty
staircase
and
on
reaching
the
third
landing
was
received
by
agamemnon
in
a
roomy
uniform
of
a
chasseur
dark
green
and
tarnished
gold
with
a
and
black
feather
and
a
couteau
de
chasse
slung
by
a
shining
belt
over
his
shoulder
the
opening
of
the
inner
door
displayed
the
worthy
colonel
sitting
at
his
ease
with
his
toes
on
each
side
of
the
stove
for
the
evenings
had
begun
to
get
cool
munching
the
last
bit
of
crust
of
the
fifth
périgord
pie
that
the
countess
had
got
him
to
he
was
extremely
smart
thin
black
stockings
black
satin
breeches
white
waistcoat
with
a
rolling
collar
showing
an
amplitude
of
frill
a
blue
coat
with
yellow
buttons
and
a
velvet
collar
while
his
pumps
shone
as
bright
as
polished
steel
the
countess
presently
sidled
into
the
room
all
smirks
and
smiles
as
dressy
ladies
generally
are
when
well
got
up
rouge
and
the
milliner
had
effectually
reduced
her
age
from
five
and
forty
down
to
five
and
twenty
she
wore
a
dress
of
the
palest
pink
satin
with
lilies
of
the
valley
in
her
hair
and
an
exquisitely
wrought
gold
armlet
with
a
most
lilliputian
watch
in
the
centre
jorrocks
having
finished
his
and
stuck
on
his
mustachios
the
countess
blew
out
her
bougies
and
the
trio
preceeded
by
agamemnon
with
a
lanthorn
in
his
hand
descended
the
stairs
whose
greasy
muddy
steps
contrasted
strangely
with
the
rich
delicacy
of
the
beautifully
slippered
feet
having
handed
them
into
the
voiture
agamemnon
mounted
up
behind
and
in
less
than
ten
minutes
they
rumbled
into
the
spacious
courtyard
of
the
countess
de
jackson
in
the
rue
des
and
drew
up
beneath
a
lofty
arch
at
the
foot
of
a
long
flight
of
dirty
marble
stairs
about
the
centre
of
which
was
stationed
a
de
to
show
the
company
up
to
the
hall
the
countess
de
jackson
the
wife
of
an
english
lived
in
an
au
but
the
hotel
being
of
considerable
dimensions
her
apartment
was
much
more
spacious
than
the
countess
benvolio
indeed
the
countess
de
jackson
being
a
des
had
occasion
for
greater
accommodation
and
she
had
five
low
rooms
whereof
the
centre
one
was
circular
from
which
four
others
consisting
of
an
a
kitchen
a
bedroom
and
à
radiated
agamemnon
having
opened
the
door
of
the
the
countess
benvolio
took
the
yorkshireman
arm
and
at
once
preceded
to
make
the
ascent
leaving
the
colonel
to
settle
the
fare
observing
as
they
mounted
the
stairs
that
he
was
von
exceeding
excellent
man
but
varé
slow
madame
la
contesse
benvolio
and
monsieur
stoops
cried
the
de
as
they
reached
the
door
of
the
low
where
the
countess
benvolio
deposited
her
shawl
and
took
a
final
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
she
again
took
the
yorkshireman
arm
and
entered
the
round
ballroom
which
though
low
and
out
of
all
proportion
had
an
exceedingly
gay
appearance
from
the
judicious
arrangement
of
the
numerous
lights
reflected
in
costly
mirrors
and
the
simple
elegance
of
the
crimson
drapery
festooned
with
flowers
and
evergreens
against
the
gilded
walls
indeed
the
hotel
had
been
the
residence
of
an
ambassador
before
the
first
revolution
and
this
had
formed
the
private
apartment
of
his
excellency
the
door
immediately
opposite
the
one
by
which
they
entered
led
into
the
countess
de
jackson
bedroom
which
was
also
lighted
up
with
the
best
furniture
exposed
and
her
set
out
with
numberless
scent
bottles
vases
trinkets
and
while
the
à
was
converted
into
a
having
been
presented
in
due
form
to
the
hostess
the
yorkshireman
and
his
new
friend
stood
surveying
the
gay
crowd
of
beautiful
and
women
large
frilled
and
men
all
chatting
and
bowing
and
dancing
when
a
titter
that
ran
through
the
room
attracted
their
attention
and
turning
round
jorrocks
was
seen
poking
his
way
through
the
crowd
with
a
number
of
straws
sticking
to
his
feet
giving
him
the
appearance
of
a
feathered
mercury
the
fact
was
that
agamemnon
had
cleaned
his
shoes
with
the
liquid
varnish
french
polish
and
forgetting
to
dry
it
properly
the
carrying
away
half
the
straw
from
the
bottom
of
the
was
the
consequence
and
jorrocks
having
paid
the
jehu
rather
short
the
latter
had
not
cared
to
tell
him
about
it
the
straws
were
however
soon
removed
without
interruption
to
the
gaiety
of
the
evening
stubbs
of
course
took
an
early
opportunity
of
waltzing
with
the
countess
benvolio
who
as
all
french
women
are
was
an
admirable
dancer
and
jorrocks
stood
by
fingering
and
curling
his
mustachios
admiring
her
movements
but
apparently
rather
jealous
of
the
yorkshireman
i
wish
said
he
after
the
dance
was
over
that
you
would
sit
down
at
and
let
us
try
to
win
some
of
these
mouncheers

us
go
into
the
cardroom
but
first
let
us
see
if
we
can

the
way

a

with
a
trayful
of

some
refreshment
oh
oui
replied
the
garçon
taking
him
to
an
open
window
overlooking
the
courtyard
and
extending
his
hand
in
the
air
voilà
monsieur
de
très
bon
rafraîchissement
the
ball
proceeded
with
the
utmost
decorum
for
though
composed
of
shopkeepers
and
such
like
there
was
nothing
in
their
dress
or
manner
to
indicate
anything
but
the
best
possible
breeding
jorrocks
indeed
fancied
himself
in
the
very
élite
of
french
society
and
but
for
a
little
incident
would
have
remained
of
that
opinion
in
an
unlucky
moment
he
took
it
into
his
head
he
could
waltz
and
surprised
the
countess
benvolio
by
claiming
her
hand
for
the
next
dance
it
seems
werry
easy
said
he
to
himself
as
he
eyed
the
couples
gliding
round
the
room
at
all
ewents
there
nothing
like
trying
he
who
never
makes
an
effort
never
risks
a
failure
the
couples
were
soon
formed
and
ranged
for
a
fresh
dance
jorrocks
took
a
conspicuous
position
in
the
centre
of
the
room
buttoned
his
coat
and
as
the
music
struck
up
put
his
arm
round
the
waist
of
his
partner
the
countess
it
seems
had
some
misgivings
as
to
his
prowess
in
the
dancing
line
and
used
all
her
strength
to
get
him
well
off
but
the
majority
of
the
dancers
started
before
him
at
length
however
he
began
to
move
and
went
rolling
away
in
something
between
a
gallop
and
a
waltz
effecting
two
turns
like
a
great
which
brought
him
bang
across
the
room
right
into
the
track
of
another
couple
who
were
swinging
down
at
full
speed
making
a
cannon
with
his
head
against
both
theirs
and
ending
by
all
four
coming
down
upon
the
hard
boards
with
a
tremendous
crash
the
countess
benvolio
undermost
then
the
partner
of
the
other
countess
then
jorrocks
and
then
the
other
countess
herself
great
was
the
commotion
and
the
music
stopped
jorrocks
lost
his
wig
and
split
his
beelzebub
breeches
across
the
knees
while
the
other
gentleman
cracked
his
behind
and
the
countess
benvolio
and
the
other
countess
were
considerably
damaged
particularly
the
other
countess
who
lost
four
false
teeth
and
broke
an
this
however
was
not
the
worst
for
as
soon
as
they
were
all
scraped
together
and
set
right
again
the
other
countess
partner
attacked
jorrocks
most
furiously
calling
him
a
of
an
englishman
a
mauvais
sujet
a
cochon
then
spitting
on
the
floor
the
greatest
insult
a
frenchman
can
offer
he
vapoured
about
being
one
of
the
grand
nation
that
he
was
brave
the
world
knew
it
and
concluded
by
thrusting
his
card
monsieur
charles
adolphe
eugene
confiturier
no
bis
rue
poupée
into
jorrocks
face
it
was
now
jorrocks
turn
to
speak
so
doubling
his
fists
and
getting
close
to
him
he
held
one
to
his
nose
exclaiming
d
n
ye
sir
je
suis
jorrocks
je
suis
an
englishman
je
vous
lick
within
an
inch
of
your
life
je
vous
kick
je
vous
mill
je
vous
flabbergaster
and
concluded
by
giving
him
his
card
monsieur
le
colonel
jorrocks
no
rue
des
a
friend
of
the
confectioner
interposed
and
got
him
away
and
stubbs
persuaded
jorrocks
to
return
into
the
cardroom
where
they
were
speedily
waited
upon
by
the
friend
of
the
former
who
announced
that
the
colonel
must
make
an
apology
or
fight
for
he
said
although
jorrocks
was
a
colonel
anglais
still
monsieur
eugene
was
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
consequently
very
brave
and
not
to
be
insulted
with
impunity
all
this
the
yorkshireman
interpreted
to
jorrocks
who
was
most
anxious
to
fight
and
wished
it
was
light
that
they
might
go
to
work
immediately
stubbs
therefore
told
the
friend
who
was
also
his
foreman
that
the
colonel
would
fight
him
with
pistols
at
six
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
but
no
sooner
was
the
word
pistols
mentioned
than
the
friend
exclaimed
with
a
grimace
and
shrug
of
his
shoulders
oh
horror
no
monsieur
adolphe
is
brave
but
he
will
not
touch
pistols
they
not
weapons
of
his
country
jorrocks
then
proposed
to
fight
him
with
broad
swords
but
this
the
confectioner
foreman
declined
on
behalf
of
his
principal
and
at
last
the
colonel
suggested
that
they
could
not
do
better
than
fight
it
out
with
fists
now
the
confectioner
was
ten
years
younger
than
jorrocks
tall
and
not
with
flesh
and
had
moreover
taken
lessons
of
harry
harmer
when
that
worthy
had
his
school
in
paris
so
he
thought
the
offer
was
a
good
one
and
immediately
closed
with
it
jorrocks
too
had
been
a
patron
of
the
having
studied
under
bill
richmond
the
man
of
colour
and
was
reported
to
have
exhibited
in
early
life
incog
with
a
pugilist
of
some
pretensions
at
the
so
all
things
considered
fists
seemed
a
very
proper
mode
of
settling
the
matter
and
that
being
agreed
upon
each
party
quitted
the
countess
de
jackson
the
confectioner
putting
forth
all
manner
of
ejaculations
and
prayers
for
success
as
he
groped
about
the
for
his
hat
and
descended
the
stairs
oh
god
of
war
said
he
throwing
up
his
hands
who
guided
the
victorious
army
of
this
grand
nation
in
egypt
when
from
the
pyramids
forty
centuries
beheld
our
actions
oh
brilliant
sun
who
shone
upon
our
armies
at
jaffa
at
naples
montebello
marengo
austerlitz
jena
and
algiers
who
blessed
our
endeavours
who
knowest
that
we
are
brave
brave
as
a
hundred
lions
look
down
on
charles
adolphe
eugene
and
enable
him
to
massacre
and
immolate
on
the
altar
of
his
wrath
this
beastly
hog
of
an
englishman
and
thereupon
he
spit
upon
the
flags
with
all
the
venom
of
a
viper
jorrocks
too
indulged
in
a
few
figures
of
speech
as
he
poked
his
way
home
though
of
a
different
description
now
blister
my
kidneys
said
he
slapping
his
thigh
but
i
sarve
him
out
i
baste
him
as
randall

i
knock
him
about
as
belcher

his

scroggins
i
fib
him
till
he
as
black
as
agamemnon
for
i
do
feel
as
though
i
could
fight
a
few
the
massive
folding
doors
of
the
at
the
hôtel
had
not
received
their
morning
opening
when
a
tremendous
loud
long
protracted
sounded
like
thunder
throughout
the
extensive
square
and
brought
numerous
nightcapped
heads
to
the
windows
to
see
whether
the
hotel
was
on
fire
or
another
revolution
had
broken
out
the
screamed
the
porter
ran
the
de
looked
out
of
his
window
and
the
and
male
des
rushed
into
the
yard
with
fear
and
astonishment
depicted
on
their
countenances
when
on
peeping
through
the
grating
of
the
little
door
jorrocks
was
descried
knocker
in
hand
about
to
sound
a
second
edition
now
nothing
is
more
offensive
to
the
nerves
of
a
frenchman
than
a
riotous
knock
and
the
impertinence
was
not
at
all
migitated
by
its
proceeding
from
a
stranger
who
appeared
to
have
arrived
through
the
undignified
medium
of
a
having
scanned
his
dimensions
and
satisfied
himself
that
notwithstanding
all
the
noise
jorrocks
was
mere
mortal
man
the
porter
unbolted
the
door
and
commenced
a
loud
and
energetic
tirade
of
abuse
against
monsieur
anglais
for
his
audacious
thumping
which
he
swore
was
enough
to
make
every
man
of
the
national
guard
rush
to
arms
in
the
midst
of
the
torrent
very
little
of
which
jorrocks
understood
the
yorkshireman
appeared
whom
he
hurried
into
the
bundled
in
after
him
cried
ally
to
the
driver
and
off
they
jolted
at
a
miserably
slow
trot
a
little
before
seven
they
reached
the
village
of
passy
where
it
was
arranged
they
should
meet
and
proceed
from
thence
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
to
select
a
convenient
place
for
the
fight
but
neither
the
confectioner
nor
his
second
nor
any
one
on
his
behalf
was
visible
and
they
walked
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
village
making
every
possible
inquiry
without
seeing
or
hearing
anything
of
them
at
length
having
waited
a
couple
of
hours
jorrocks
appetite
overpowered
his
desire
of
revenge
and
caused
him
to
retire
to
the
to
indulge
in
a
fork
breakfast
nature
being
satisfied
he
called
for
pen
and
ink
and
with
the
aid
of
stubbs
drew
up
the
following
proclamation
which
to
this
day
remains
posted
in
the

copy
whereof

this
day
repaired

this
being
completed
and
the
bill
paid
they
returned
leisurely
on
foot
to
paris
looking
first
at
one
object
then
at
another
so
that
the
countess
benvolio
was
passed
ere
they
reached
the
tuileries
gardens
where
after
resting
themselves
until
it
began
to
get
dusk
and
their
appetites
returned
they
repaired
to
the
café
de
paris
to
destroy
them
the
lofty
salon
was
just
lighted
up
and
the
numberless
lamps
reflected
in
costly
mirrors
in
almost
every
partition
of
the
wall
aided
by
the
graceful
figures
and
elegant
dresses
of
the
ladies
interspersed
among
the
gentry
with
here
and
there
the
gay
uniforms
of
the
military
imparted
a
fairy
air
to
the
scene
which
was
not
a
little
heightened
by
the
contrast
produced
by
jorrocks
substantial
figure
stumping
through
the
centre
with
his
hat
on
his
head
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
the
dust
of
the
day
hanging
about
his
hessians

hanging
up
his

taking
his
place

accordingly

brought
him
the

about
it
bring

cried
stubbs
with
dismay
i
see
you
do

ordering
a
dinner
in

let
me
teach
you
the
here
said
jorrocks
is
bill
of
lading
handing
over
the
garçon
apportez
une
douzaine
des
huîtres
un
citron
et
du
beurre
frais
said
the
yorkshireman
and
while
they
were
discussing
the
propriety
of
eating
them
before
or
after
the
soup
a
beautiful
dish
of
little
green
oysters
made
their
appearance
which
were
encored
before
the
first
supply
was
finished
now
colonel
said
the
yorkshireman
take
a
bumper
of
chablis
lifting
a
pint
bottle
out
of
the
cooler
it
has
had
one
plunge
in
the
and
no
more
see
what
a
delicate
rind
it
leaves
on
the
glass
eyeing
it
as
he
spoke
ay
but
i
rayther
it
should
leave
something
in
the
mouth
than
on
the
side
of
the
glass
replied
jorrocks
i
loves
a
good
strong
generous
wine
military
port
in
fact
but
here
comes
fish
and
soup
wot
are
they
filet
de
sole
au
gratin
et
potage
au
macaroni
avec
fromage
de
parmesan
i
take
fish
first
because
the
soup
will
keep
hot
longest
so
will
i
said
jorrocks
for
i
think
you
understand
the
thing
but
they
seem
to
give
werry
small
it
really
looks
like
trifling
with
one
appetite
i
likes
the
old
joint
the
system
such
as
we
used
to
have
at
sugden
in
cornhill
joint
wegitables
and
cheese
all
for
two
shillings
talk
of
your
joints
here
rejoined
the
yorkshireman
i
told
you
before
you
do
understand
the
art
of
eating
the
dexterity
of
the
thing
consists
in
titivating
the
appetite
with
delicate
morsels
so
as
to
prolong
the
pleasure
a
french
dinner
lasts
two
hours
whereas
you
go
off
at
score
and
take
the
shine
out
of
yourself
before
you
turn
the
tattenham
corner
of
your
appetite
but
come
take
another
glass
of
chablis
for
your
voice
is
husky
as
though
your
throat
was
full
of
will
you
eat
some
of
this
no
not
no
bouleward
for
me
thank
ye
well
then
we
will
have
the
de
boeuf
beef
with
sauce
tomate
and
there
is
a
côtelette
de
veau
en
papillotte
which
will
you
take
i
trouble
the
beef
i
think
i
do
like
that
pantaloon
cutlet
much
the
skin
is
so
tough
oh
but
you
do
eat
the
paper
man
that
is
only
put
on
to
keep
this
nice
layer
of
fat
ham
from
melting
take
some
if
it
is
only
that
you
may
enjoy
a
glass
of
champagne
after
it
there
is
no
meat
like
veal
for
paving
the
way
for
a
glass
of
champagne
well
i
do
care
if
i
do
now
you
have
explained
how
to
eat
it
for
i
really
been
troubled
with
indigestion
all
day
from
eating
one
wholesale
yesterday
but
do
you
stand
potatoes
pommes
de
terre
as
we
say
in
france
oh
yes
fried
and
à
la
maître
here
they
come
smoking
hot
now
j
for
a
glass
of
champagne
take
it
out
of
the
pail
nay
man
not
with
both
hands
round
the
middle
unless
you
like
it
warm
by
the
neck
so
showing
him
how
to
do
it
and
pouring
him
a
glass
of
still
champagne
this
wo
do
said
jorrocks
holding
it
up
to
the
candle
garsoon
garsoon
no
good
no
bon
no
fizzay
no
fizzay
giving
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
a
slap
with
his
hand
to
rouse
it
oh
but
this
is
still
champagne
explained
the
yorkshireman
and
far
the
best
i
do
think
so
retorted
jorrocks
emptying
the
glass
into
his
well
then
have
a
bottle
of
the
other
rejoined
the
yorkshireman
ordering
one
and
who
to
pay
for
it
inquired
jorrocks
oh
never
mind
that
care
killed
the
cat
give
a
loose
to
pleasure
for
once
for
it
a
poor
heart
that
never
rejoices
here
it
comes
and
you
never
know
what
it
is
to
want
as
the
beggar
boys
now
let
see
you
treat
it
like
a
philosopher
the
wire
is
off
so
you
nothing
to
do
but
cut
the
string
and
press
the
cork
on
one
side
with
your
nay
you
cut
both
sides
fizz
pop
bang
and
away
went
the
cork
close
past
the
ear
of
an
old
deaf
general
and
bounded
against
the
come
there
no
mischief
done
so
pour
out
the
your
good
health
old
boy
may
you
live
for
a
thousand
years
and
i
be
there
to
count
them
now
that
what
i
call
good
observed
the
yorkshireman
holding
up
his
glass
see
how
it
dulls
the
glass
even
to
the
rim
champagne
is
worth
a
copper
unless
it
iced

cools
my
courage

gets
below

werry
gentlemanly
ideas

a
continuance
i
do

but
i
should
prefer
mild
hale

very
gentlemanly
ideas

chaps
with
them

nicer
artichokes
á
la
sauce
blanche
you
get
the
real
eating
part
you
see
by
having
them
sent
up
this
way
instead
of
like
haystacks
as
they
come
in
england
diving
and
burning
your
fingers
amid
an
infinity
of
leaves
they
are
werry
pretty
eating
i
must
confess
and
this
upper
binjamin
of
ham
the
birds
are
cooked
in
is
delicious
i
trouble
you
for
another
plateful
right
colonel
you
are
yourself
again
i
always
thought
you
would
come
back
into
the
right
course
and
now
you
are
good
for
a
glass
of
claret
of
light
hermitage
come
buck
up
and
give
a
loose
to
pleasure
for
once

once
ay
that
what
you
always
say
but
your
once
comes
so
werry
often
say
no
garçon
un
de
julien
and
here
j
is
a
dish
upon
which
i
will
stake
my
credit
as
an
experienced
caterer
a
charlotte
de
pommes
upon
my
reputation
it
is
a
fine
one
the
crust
is
browned
to
a
turn
and
the
rich
apricot
lies
ensconced
in
the
middle
like
a
sleeping
babe
in
its
cradle
if
ever
man
deserved
a
peerage
and
a
pension
it
is
this
cook
it
werry
delicious
order
another
oh
your
eyes
are
bigger
than
your
stomach
j
according
to
all
mathematical
calculations
this
will
more
than
suffice
ay
i
thought
so
you
are
regularly
at
a
take
a
glass
of
whatever
you
like
good
i
drink
chablis
to
your
champagne
and
now
that
there
may
be
no
mistake
as
to
our
country
we
will
have
some
cheese
fromage
de
roquefort
gruyère
neufchatel
or
whatever
you
like
and
a
beaker
of
burgundy
after
and
then
remove
the
cloth
for
i
hate
dabbling
in
dowlas
after
dinner
is
done
rum
beggars
these
french
said
jorrocks
to
himself
laying
down
the
newspaper
and
taking
a
sip
of
churchman
chocolate
as
on
the
sunday
morning
he
sat
with
the
countess
benvolio
discussing
rolls
and
butter
with
for
breakfast
rum
beggars
indeed
said
he
resuming
the
paper
and
reading
the
programme
of
the
amusements
for
the
day
commencing
with
the
hour
of
protestant
service
at
the
ambassador
chapel
followed
on
by
palace
and
gallery
of
pictures
of
the
palais
royal
review
with
military
music
in
the
place
du
carousel
in
the
champs
de

fête
in
the
park
of
st
cloud
combat
that
is
to
say
and
at
the
barrière
du
combat
tivoli
it
not
werry
right
but
i
suppose
at
rome
we
must
do
as
romans
do
with
which
comfortable
reflection
jorrocks
proposed
that
the
countess
and
he
should
go
to
the
races
madame
was
not
partial
to
animals
of
any
description
but
having
got
a
new
hat
and
feathers
she
consented
to
show
them
on
condition
that
they
adjoined
to
the
fête
at
st
cloud
in
the
evening
accordingly
about
noon
the
ostler
man
of
a
neighbouring
english
drew
up
a
job
cab
with
a
striped
calico
lining
drawn
by
a
venerable
white
horse
at
the
countess
gateway
in
the
rue
des
into
which
jorrocks
having
handed
her
ladyship
and
agamemnon
who
was
attired
in
his
chasseur
uniform
having
climbed
up
behind
the
old
horse
after
two
or
three
flourishes
of
his
dirty
white
tail
as
a
sort
of
acknowledgment
of
the
whip
on
his
sides
got
himself
into
motion
and
proceeded
on
his
way
to
the
races
the
countess
being
resolved
to
cut
a
dash
had
persuaded
our
hero
to
add
a
smart
with
a
flowing
feather
to
the
rest
of
his
military
attire
and
the
end
of
a
scarlet
handkerchief
peeping
out
at
the
breast
of
his
embroidered
gave
him
the
appearance
of
wearing
a
decoration
and
procured
him
the
usual
salute
from
the
soldiers
and
veterans
of
the
hospital
of
invalids
who
were
lounging
about
the
ramparts
and
walks
of
the
edifice
the
countess
costume
was
simple
and
elegant
a
satin
pelisse
with
boots
to
match
and
a
white
satin
bonnet
with
white
feathers
tipped
with
blue
and
delicate
gloves
of
course
the
head
of
the
cab
was
well
thrown
back
to
exhibit
the
elegant
inmates
to
the
world
great
respect
is
paid
to
the
military
in
france
as
jorrocks
found
by
all
the
hack
cab
and
drivers
pulling
up
and
making
way
for
him
to
pass
as
the
old
white
horse
slowly
dragged
its
long
length
to
the
gateway
of
the
champ
de
mars
here
the
guard
both
horse
and
foot
saluted
him
which
he
politely
acknowledged
under
direction
of
the
countess
by
raising
his
and
a
subaltern
was
dispatched
by
the
officer
in
command
to
conduct
him
to
the
place
appointed
for
the
carriages
to
stand
but
for
this
piece
of
attention
jorrocks
would
certainly
have
drawn
up
at
the
splendid
building
of
the
école
militaire
standing
as
it
does
like
a
grand
stand
in
the
centre
of
the
gravelly
dusty
plain
of
the
champ
de
mars
the
officer
having
speared
his
way
through
the
crowd
with
the
usual
courtesy
of
a
frenchman
at
length
drew
up
the
cab
in
a
long
line
of
anonymous
vehicles
under
the
rows
of
stunted
elms
by
the
ditch
on
the
southern
side
of
the
plain
when
turning
his
charger
round
he
saluted
jorrocks
and
bumped
off
at
a
trot
jorrocks
then
stuck
the
whip
into
the
socket
and
throwing
forward
the
apron
handed
out
the
countess
and
installed
agamemnon
in
the
cab
a
fine
day
and
a
crowd
make
the
french
people
thoroughly
happy
and
on
this
afternoon
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
warmly
on
the
land
still
there
was
no
apparently
settled
purpose
for
the
assembling
of
the
multitude
who
formed
themselves
in
groups
upon
the
plain
or
lined
the
mounds
at
the
sides
in
most
independent
parties
the
champ
de
mars
forms
a
regular
parallelogram
of
feet
by
and
the
course
which
is
of
an
oblong
form
comprises
a
circuit
of
the
whole
and
is
marked
out
with
strong
posts
and
ropes
within

equestrians
or
more
properly
speaking
men
on

are
admitted
under
the
surveillance
of

of

and

are
placed
in

directions
with

swords
and

gravelly
sandy
soil
in
almost
daily
requisition
for
the
exercise
and
training
of
troops
no
symptoms
of
vegetation
can
be
expected
and
the
course
is
as
hard
as
the
ride
in
rotten
row
or
up
to
kensington
gardens
about
the
centre
of
the
south
side
near
where
the
carriages
were
drawn

temporary

erected
for

in

hung
with
scarlet
and

while
the
others
were
tastefully
arranged

who
do
mind
risking
their
necks
for

sight
some
few
itinerants
tramped
about

offering
alternately
and
for
sale

one
of

with
a
woodcut

with

big
as

list

sorry

into

quite
so
cleverly
as
our
printer
could
wish
footnote
racing
in
france
is
of
course
now
a
very
different
business
to
the
primitive
sport
it
was
when
this
sketch
was
editor
foreigners
accuse
the
english
of
claiming
every
horse
and
every
carriage
met
on
the
continent
as
their
own
but
we
think
that
few
would
be
ambitious
of
laying
claim
to
the
honour
of
supplying
france
with
jockeys
or
racehorses
jorrocks
indeed
indifferent
as
he
is
to
the
affairs
of
the
turf
could
not
suppress
his
conwiction
of
the
difference
between
the
appearance
of
the
frenchmen
and
the
quiet
easy
jockeys
of
newmarket
the
former
all
legs
and
elbows
spurting
and
pushing
to
the
front
at
starting
in
tawdry
faded
jackets
and
nankeen
shorts
just
like
the
frowsy
of
an
epsom
the
latter
in
clean
leathers
boots
spick
and
span
new
jackets
feeling
their
horses
mouths
quietly
in
the
rear
with
their
whip
hands
resting
on
their
thighs
then
such
riding
a
hulking
norman
with
his
knees
up
to
his
chin
and
a
long
lean
looking
frenchman
sat
astride
like
a
pair
of
tongs
with
a
wet
sponge
applied
to
his
knees
before
starting
followed
by
a
runaway
english
stable
lad
in
white
cords
and
drab
gaiters
and
half
a
dozen
others
equally
singular
spurring
and
tearing
round
and
round
throwing
the
gravel
and
sand
into
each
other
faces
until
the
field
was
so
separated
as
to
render
it
difficult
to
say
which
was
leading
and
which
was
tailing
for
it
is
one
of
the
rules
of
their
races
that
each
heat
must
be
run
in
a
certain
time
consequently
though
all
the
horses
may
be
distanced
the
winner
keeps
working
away
then
what
an
absence
of
interest
and
enthusiasm
on
the
part
of
the
spectators
of
them
did
not
know
where
the
horses
started
scarcely
a
man
knew
their
names
and
the
few
tenpenny
bets
that
were
made
were
sported
upon
the
colour
of
the
jackets
a
frenchman
has
no
notion
of
racing
and
it
is
on
record
that
after
a
heat
in
which
the
winning
horse
after
making
a
waiting
race
ran
in
at
the
finish
a
parisian
observed
that
although
had
won
at
the
finish
he
thought
the
greater
honour
was
due
to
he
having
kept
the
lead
the
greater
part
of
the
distance
on
someone
explaining
to
him
that
the
jockey
on
annette
had
purposely
made
a
waiting
race
he
was
totally
incredulous
asserting
that
he
was
sure
the
jockeys
had
too
much
to
remain
in
the
rear
at
any
part
of
the
race
when
they
might

to
himself
curling
his

of
pieces
in
the
pocket
of
his

moderate
sport
indeed
and
therefore
he
turned
his
back
to
the

and
walked
the
countess
off
towards
the
cab
from
beneath
a
low
booth
called

by
poles
placed
on
the

trees
of
the

and
exhibiting
on
a

board

in
british
beer
in
gilt
letters
there
issued
the
sound
of
voices
clamouring
about

and
weights
and
scales
and
on
looking
in
a
score
of
grooms
imitation
jockeys
and
the
usual
of
the
racehorses
and
were
seen
drinking
beer
smoking
playing
at
cards
dice
and
before
the
canvas
curtain
that
flapped
before
the
entrance
a
crowd
had
collected
round
one
of
the
horses
which
was
in
the
care
of
five
or
six
fellows
one
to
hold
him
another
to
whistle
to
him
a
third
to
whisk
the
flies
away
with
a
horse
tail
a
fourth
to
scrape
him
a
fifth
to
rinse
his
mouth
out
while
the
a
tall
gaunt
fellow
in
his
shirt
sleeves
with
a
blue
apron
and
trousers
more
like
a
gardener
than
a
groom
walked
round
and
round
with
mystified
dignity
sacréing
and
muttering

as
anyone
approached
who
seemed
likely
to
ask
questions
jorrocks
having
well
ascertained
the
importance
of
his
hat
and
feather
pushed
his
way
with
the
greatest
coolness
into
the
ring
just
to
cast
his
eye
over
the
horse
and
see
whether
he
was
fit
to
go
with
the
surrey
and
the
immediately
took
off
his
foraging
cap
and
made
two
profound
salaams
one
to
the
colonel
the
other
to
the
countess
jorrocks
all
politeness
took
off
his
and
no
sooner
was
it
in
the
air
than
with
a
wild
exclamation
of
surprise
and
delight
the
groom
screamed
oh
monsieur
shorrock
mon
ami
comment
vous
portez

threw
his
arms
round
the
colonel
neck
and
kissed
him
on
each
cheek
hold
roared
the
colonel
half
smothered
in
the
embrace
and
disengaging
himself
he
drew
back
a
few
paces
putting
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
when
in
the
training
groom
of
paris
he
recognised
his
friend
the
baron
of
newmarket
the
abruptness
of
the
incident
disarmed
jorrocks
of
reflection
and
being
a
man
of
impulse
and
warm
affections
he
at
once
forgave
the
novelty
of
the
embrace
and
most
cordially
joined
hands
with
those
of
his
friend
they
then
struck
up
a
mixture
of
broken
english
and
equally
broken
french
in
mutual
inquiries
after
each
other
healths
and
movements
and
presuming
that
jorrocks
was
following
up
the
sporting
trade
in
paris
the
baron
most
considerately
gave
him
his
best
recommendations
which
horse
to
back
kindly
betting
with
him
himself
but
unfortunately
at
each
time
assigning
jorrocks
the
losing
horse
at
length
being
completely
cleaned
out
he
declined
any
further
transactions
and
having
got
the
countess
into
the
cab
was
in
the
act
of
climbing
in
himself
when
someone
took
him
by
the
sword
as
he
was
hoisting
himself
up
by
the
wooden
apron
and
drew
him
back
to
the
ground

stubbs
my
boy
cried
he
i
werry
to
see
ye
holding
out
his
hand
and
thereupon
stubbs
took
off
his
hat
to
the
countess
well
now
the
deuce
be
in
these
french
observed
jorrocks
confidentially
in
an
undertone
as
resigning
the
reins
to
agamemnon
he
put
his
arm
through
the
yorkshireman
and
drew
out
of
hearing
of
the
countess
behind
the
cab
the
deuce
be
in
them
i
say
there
that
beggarly
baron
as
we
met
at
newmarket
has
just
diddled
me
out
of
four
naps
and
a
half
by
getting
me
to
back
that
he
said
were
certain
to
win
and
i
really
know
how
we
are
to
make
and
buckle
meet
as
the
coachmen
say
somehow
or
other
they
are
far
too
sharp
for
me
cards
dominoes
dice
backgammon
and
racing
all
one
they
inwariably
beat
me
and
i
declare
i
have
as
much
pewter
as
will
coach
me
to
calais
the
yorkshireman
as
may
be
supposed
was
not
in
a
condition
of
any
great
pecuniary
assistance
but
after
a
turn
or
two
along
the
mound
he
felt
it
would
be
a
reproach
on
his
country
if
he
suffered
his
friend
to
be
done
by
a
frenchman
and
on
consideration
he
thought
of
a
trick
that
monsieur
would
not
be
up
to
accordingly
desiring
jorrocks
to
take
him
to
the
baron
and
behave
with
great
cordiality
and
agree
to
the
proposal
he
should
make
they
set
off
in
search
of
that
worthy
who
after
some
trouble
they
discovered
in
the
cottage
of
content
entertaining
john
jones
and
his
comrades
with
an
account
of
the
manner
in
which
he
had
fleeced
monsieur
shorrock
the
yorkshireman
met
him
with
the
greatest
delight
shook
hands
with
him
over
and
over
again
and
then
began
talking
about
racing
and
newmarket
pretended
to
be
full
of
money
and
very
anxious
for
the
baron
advice
in
laying
it
out
on
hearing
this
the
baron
beckoned
him
to
retire
and
joining
him
in
the
avenue
walked
him
up
and
down
while
he
recommended
his
backing
a
horse
that
was
notoriously
amiss
the
yorkshireman
consented
lost
a
nap
with
great
good
humour
and
banteringly
told
the
baron
he
thought
he
could
beat
the
horse
on
foot
this
led
them
to
talk
of
and
at
last
the
yorkshireman
offered
to
bet
that
jorrocks
would
run
fifty
yards
with
him
on
his
back
before
the
baron
would
run
a
hundred
upon
this
the
baron
scratched
his
head
and
looked
very
knowing
pretended
to
make
a
calculation
when
the
yorkshireman
affected
fear
and
professed
his
readiness
to
withdraw
the
offer
the
baron
then
plucked
up
his
courage
and
after
some
haggling
the
match
was
made
for
six
naps
the
yorkshireman
reckoning
the
baron
might
have
ten
francs
in
addition
to
what
he
had
won
of
jorrocks
and
himself
the
money
was
then
deposited
in
the
hands
of
the
countess
benvolio
and
away
went
the
trio
to
the
cottage
of
content
to
get
men
and
ropes
to
measure
and
keep
the
ground
the
english
jockeys
and
lads
though
ready
enough
to
pigeon
a
countryman
themselves
have
no
notion
of
assisting
a
foreigner
to
do
so
unless
they
share
in
the
spoil
and
the
baron
being
a
notorious
screw
they
all
seemed
heartily
glad
to
find
him
in
a
trap
out
then
they
all
sallied
amid
cheers
and
shouts
while
john
jones
with
a
in
his
hand
proceeded
to
measure
a
hundred
yards
along
the
low
side
of
the
mound
this
species
of
amusement
being
far
more
in
accordance
with
the
taste
of
the
french
than
anything
in
which
horses
are
concerned
an
immense
mob
flocked
to
the
scene
and
the
baron
having
explained
how
it
was
and
being
considered
a
safe
man
to
follow
numerous
offers
were
made
to
bet
against
the
performance
of
the
match
the
yorkshireman
being
a
youth
of
discretion
and
accustomed
to
bet
among
strangers
got
on
five
naps
more
with
different
parties
who
to
prevent
accidents
submitted
to
deposit
the
money
with
the
countess
and
all
things
being
adjusted
and
the
course
cleared
by
a
picket
of
infantry
jorrocks
ungirded
his
sword
and
depositing
it
with
his
in
the
cab
walked
up
to
the
fifty
yards
he
was
to
have
for
start
now
colonel
said
the
yorkshireman
backing
him
to
the
mound
so
that
he
might
leap
on
without
shaking
him
put
your
best
leg
first
and
it
a
hollow
thing
if
you
do
fall
you
must
win
and
thereupon
taking
jorrocks
cocked
hat
and
feather
from
his
head
he
put
it
sideways
on
his
own
so
that
he
might
not
be
recognised
and
mounted
his
man
jorrocks
then
took
his
place
as
directed
by
john
jones
and
at
a
signal
from
him
the
dropping
of
a
blue
cotton
handkerchief
away
they
started
amid
the
shouts
the
clapping
of
hands
and
applause
of
the
spectators
who
covered
the
mound
and
lined
the
course
on
either
side
jorrocks
action
was
not
very
capital
his
and
leathers
rather
impeding
his
limbs
while
the
baron
had
as
little
on
him
as
decency
would
allow
the
yorkshireman
feeling
his
man
rather
roll
at
the
start
again
cautioned
him
to
take
it
easy
and
after
a
dozen
yards
he
got
into
a
capital
run
and
though
the
lanky
baron
came
tearing
along
like
an
greyhound
jorrocks
had
full
two
yards
to
spare
and
ran
past
the
soldier
who
stood
with
his
cap
on
his
bayonet
as
a
amid
the
applause
of
his
backers
the
yells
of
his
opponents
and
the
general
acclamation
of
the
spectators
the
countess
anticipating
the
victory
of
her
hero
had
dispatched
agamemnon
early
in
the
day
for
a
chaplet
of
immortelles
and
having
switched
the
old
cab
horse
up
to
the
she
gracefully
descended
without
showing
more
of
her
foot
and
ankle
than
was
strictly
correct
and
decorated
his
brow
with
the
wreath
as
the
yorkshireman
dismounted
enthusiasm
being
always
the
order
of
the
day
in
france
this
act
was
greeted
with
the
loudest
acclamations
and
without
giving
him
time
to
recover
his
wind
the
populace
bundled
jorrocks
neck
and
shoulders
into
the
cab
and
seizing
the
old
horse
by
the
head
paraded
him
down
the
entire
length
of
the
champ
de
mars
jorrocks
bowing
and
kissing
his
hands
to
the
assembled
multitude
in
return
for
the
vivas
the
clapping
of
hands
and
the
waving
of
ribbons
and
handkerchiefs
that
greeted
him
as
he
went
popularity
is
but
a
fickle
goddess
and
in
no
country
more
fickle
than
in
france
ere
the
procession
reached
the
end
of
the
dusty
plain
the
mob
had
tailed
off
very
considerably
and
as
the
leader
of
the
old
white
horse
pulled
him
round
to
return
a
fresh
commotion
in
the
distance
caused
by
the
apprehension
of
a
couple
of
pickpockets
drew
away
the
few
followers
that
remained
and
the
recently
applauded
and
belauded
jorrocks
was
left
alone
in
his
glory
he
then
pulled
up
and
taking
the
chaplet
of
immortelles
from
his
brow
thrust
it
under
the
driving
cushion
of
the
cab
and
proceeded
to
reinstate
himself
in
his
tight
military
frock
himself
with
his
sword
and
resume
the
cocked
hat
and
feather
nothing
was
too
good
for
stubbs
at
that
moment
and
had
a
pen
and
ink
been
ready
jorrocks
would
have
endorsed
him
a
bill
for
any
amount
having
completed
his
toilette
he
gave
the
yorkshireman
the
vacant
seat
in
the
cab
flopped
the
old
horse
well
about
the
ears
with
the
whip
and
trotted
briskly
up
the
line
he
had
recently
passed
in
triumphal
procession
and
wormed
his
way
among
the
crowd
in
search
of
the
countess
there
was
nothing
however
to
be
seen
of
her
and
after
driving
about
and
poking
his
way
on
foot
into
all
the
crowds
he
could
find
bolting
up
to
every
lady
in
blue
he
looked
at
his
great
gold
repeater
and
finding
it
was
near
three
and
recollecting
the
fête
of
st
cloud
concluded
her
ladyship
must
have
gone
on
and
agamemnon
being
anxious
to
see
it
of
course
was
of
the
same
opinion
so
again
flopping
the
old
horse
about
the
ears
he
cut
away
down
the
champ
de
mars
and
by
the
direction
of
agamemnon
crossed
the
seine
by
the
pont
des
invalides
and
gained
the
route
to
versailles
here
the
genius
of
the
people
was
apparent
for
the
road
swarmed
with
voitures
of
every
description
diligences
gondoles
cabs
fiacres
omnibuses
all
rolling
and
rumbling
along
occasionally
interrupted
by
the
lilting
and
tilting
of
a
light
english
cab
or
tilbury
drawn
by
a
thoroughbred
and
driven
by
a
dandy
the
spirit
of
the
old
white
horse
even
seemed
roused
as
he
got
among
the
carriages
and
heard
the
tramping
of
hoofs
and
the
jingling
of
bells
round
the
necks
of
other
horses
and
he
applied
himself
to
the
shafts
with
a
vigour
his
frame
appeared
incapable
of
supplying
so
they
trotted
on
and
after
a
mile
travelling
at
a
pace
after
they
got
into
close
line
they
reached
the
porte
maillot
and
resigning
the
cab
to
the
discretion
of
agamemnon
jorrocks
got
himself
brushed
over
by
one
of
the
gentry
who
ply
in
that
profession
at
all
public
places
and
tucking
his
sword
under
one
arm
he
thrust
the
other
through
stubbs
and
strutted
up
the
long
broad
grass
avenue
through
the
low
part
of
the
wood
of
st
cloud
as
if
all
he
saw
belonged
to
himself
the
scene
was
splendid
and
nature
art
and
the
weather
appeared
confederated
for
effect
on
the
lofty
heights
arose
the
stately
place
looking
down
with
placid
grandeur
on
the
full
foliage
of
the
venerable
trees
over
the
beautiful
gardens
the
spouting
fountains
the
rushing
cascades
and
the
gay
and
countless
myriads
that
swarmed
the
avenues
while
the
circling
river
flowed
calmly
on
without
a
ripple
on
its
surface
as
if
in
ridicule
of
the
sound
of
trumpets
the
clang
of
cymbals
and
the
beat
of
drums
that
rent
the
air
around
along
the
broad
avenue
were
ranged
shows
of
every
description
wild
beasts
giants
jugglers
tumblers
mountebanks
and
monsters
while
in
spots
sheltered
from
the
sun
by
lofty
trees
were
swings
roundabouts
and
places
all
the
concomitants
of
fairs
and
fêtes
beating
bartlemy
fair
as
jorrocks
candidly
confessed
all
to
nothing
the
chance
of
meeting
the
countess
benvolio
in
such
a
multitude
was
very
remote
indeed
but
to
tell
the
truth
jorrocks
never
once
thought
of
her
until
having
eat
a
couple
of
cold
fowls
and
drank
a
bottle
of
porter
at
an
english
booth
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
his
purse
and
remembered
it
was
in
her
keeping
stubbs
however
settled
the
account
and
in
high
glee
jorrocks
resumed
his
peregrinations
visiting
first
one
show
then
another
shooting
with
then
dancing
a
quadrille
until
he
was
brought
up
short
before
a
splendid
roundabout
whose
magic
circle
contained
two
lions
two
swans
two
black
horses
a
tiger
and
a
giraffe
let
have
a
ride
said
he
jumping
on
to
one
of
the
black
horses
and
adjusting
the
stirrups
to
his
length
the
party
was
soon
made
up
and
as
the
last
comer
crossed
his
tiger
the
engine
was
propelled
by
the
boys
in
the
centre
and
away
they
went
at
derby
pace
in
six
rounds
jorrocks
lost
his
head
turned
completely
giddy
and
bellowed
out
to
them
to
stop
they
took
no
heed
all
the
rest
were
used
to
it
and
after
divers
yells
and
ineffectual
efforts
to
dismount
he
fell
to
the
ground
like
a
sack
the
machine
was
in
full
work
at
the
time
and
swept
round
three
or
four
times
before
they
could
stop
it
at
last
stubbs
got
to
him
and
a
pitiable
plight
he
was
in
he
had
fallen
on
his
head
broken
his
feather
crushed
his
chapeau
bras
lost
off
his
mustachios
was
as
pale
as
death
and
very
sick
fortunately
the
accident
happened
near
the
gate
leading
to
the
town
of
st
cloud
and
thither
with
the
aid
of
two
gendarmes
stubbs
conveyed
the
fallen
hero
and
having
put
him
to
bed
at
the
hôtel
he
sent
for
a
médecin
who
of
course
shook
his
head
looked
very
wise
ordered
him
to
drink
warm
water
a
specific
in
france
and
keep
quiet
finding
he
had
an
englishman
for
a
patient
the
médecin
dropped
in
every
two
hours
always
concluding
with
the
order
encore
chaud
a
good
sleep
did
more
for
jorrocks
than
the
doctor
and
when
the
médecin
called
in
the
morning
and
repeated
the
injunction
encore
chaud
he
bellowed
out
cuss
your
my
stomach
ai
a
reserwoir
give
me
some
wittles
the
return
of
his
appetite
being
a
most
favourable
symptom
stubbs
discharged
the
doctor
and
forthwith
ordered
a
à
la
to
which
jorrocks
did
pretty
fair
justice
though
trifling
in
comparison
with
his
usual
performances
they
then
got
into
a
versailles
diligence
that
stopped
at
the
door
and
rattling
along
at
a
merry
pace
very
soon
reached
paris
and
the
rue
des
come
up
and
see
the
countess
said
jorrocks
as
they
arrived
at
the
bottom
of
the
flight
of
dirty
stairs
and
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
his
sword
dragging
at
his
heels
he
poked
upstairs
and
opening
the
outer
door
entered
the
apartment
he
passed
through
the
small
without
observing
his
portmanteau
and
on
the
table
and
there
being
no
symptoms
of
the
countess
in
the
next
one
he
walked
forward
into
the
bedroom
beyond
before
an
english
that
jorrocks
himself
had
been
at
the
expense
of
providing
snugly
ensconced
in
the
luxurious
depths
of
a
easy
chair
sat
a
monstrous
man
with
a
green
patch
on
his
right
eye
in
slippers
loose
hose
a
dirty
grey
woollen
and
black
silk
nightcap
puffing
away
at
a
long
meerschaum
pipe
with
a
figure
of
bacchus
on
the
bowl
at
a
sight
so
unexpected
jorrocks
started
back
but
the
smoker
seemed
quite
unconcerned
and
casting
an
unmeaning
grey
eye
at
the
intruder
puffed
a
respiration
from
his
mouth
how
now
roared
jorrocks
boiling
into
a
rage
which
caused
the
monster
to
start
upon
his
legs
as
though
he
were
galvanised
vot
brings
you
here
sprechen

responded
the
smoker
opening
his
eye
a
little
wider
and
taking
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
speak
english
you
fool
bawled
jorrocks

are
very
impudent
replied
the
dutchman
with
a
thump
on
the
table
i
run

through
the
gizzard
rejoined
jorrocks
half
drawing
his
sword
skin
you
alive
in
fact
when
in
rushed
the
countess
and
threw
herself
between
them
now
mynheer
van
rosembom
a
burgomaster
of
flushing
was
an
old
friend
of
the
countess
and
an
exceedingly
good
paying
one
and
having
cast
up
that
morning
quite
unexpectedly
by
the
early
diligence
from
dunkirk
and
the
countess
being
enraged
at
jorrocks
for
not
sharing
the
honours
of
his
procession
in
the
cab
on
the
previous
day
and
believing
moreover
that
his
treasury
was
pretty
well
exhausted
thought
she
could
not
do
better
than
instal
rosembom
in
his
place
and
retain
the
stakes
she
held
for
the
colonel
board
and
lodging
this
arrangement
she
kept
to
herself
simply
giving
rosembom
who
was
not
a
much
better
frenchman
than
jorrocks
to
understand
that
the
room
would
be
ready
for
him
shortly
and
agamemnon
was
ordered
to
bundle
jorrocks
clothes
into
his
portmanteau
and
bag
and
place
them
in
readiness
in
the
rosembom
fatigued
with
his
journey
then
retired
to
enjoy
his
pipe
at
his
ease
while
the
countess
went
to
the
marche
honoré
to
buy
some
sour
crout
roast
beef
and
prunes
for
his
dinner
turn
this
great
out
of
my
room
cried
jorrocks
as
the
countess
rushed
into
his
apartment
vot
he
doing
here
doucement

said
she
clapping
him
on
the
back

a

roared
jorrocks
eyeing
him
as
he
spoke
never
such
a
thing
no
more
than
myself
out
with
him
i
say
or
i
cut
my
stick
suite
avec
tout
mon
coeur
replied
the
countess
her
choler
rising
as
she
spoke
you
another
rejoined
jorrocks
judging
by
her
manner
that
she
called
him
something
offensive
vous
ête
one
mauvaise
woman
monsieur
said
the
countess
her
eyes
flashing
as
she
spoke
vous
êtes
un
polisson
von
rascal
von
dem
villain
un
charlatan
von
nasty
bastely
ross
bif
dem
dog
and
thereupon
she
curled
her
fingers
and
set
her
teeth
on
edge
as
though
she
would
tear
his
very
eyes
out
rosembom
though
he
did
exactly
see
the
merits
of
the
matter
exchanged
his
pipe
for
the
poker
so
what
with
this
the
sword
and
the
nails
things
wore
a
very
belligerent
aspect
stubbs
as
usual
interposed
and
the
countess
still
keeping
up
the
semblance
of
her
rage
ordered
them
to
quit
her
apartment
directly
or
she
would
have
recourse
to
her
old
friends
the
police
stubbs
was
quite
agreeable
to
go
but
he
hinted
that
she
might
as
well
hand
over
the
stakes
that
had
been
entrusted
to
her
keeping
on
the
previous
day
upon
which
she
again
indulged
in
a
torrent
of
abuse
swore
they
were
a
couple
of
thieves
and
that
jorrocks
owed
her
far
more
than
the
amount
for
board
and
lodging
this
made
the
colonel
stare
for
on
the
supposition
that
he
was
a
visitor
he
had
been
firing
away
his
money
in
all
directions
playing
at
everything
she
proposed
buying
her
bonnets
perigord
pies
hiring
remises
and
committing
every
species
of
extravagance
and
now
to
be
charged
for
what
he
thought
was
pure
friendship
disgusted
him
beyond
expression
the
countess
speedily
summoned
the
porter
the
man
of
letters
of
the
establishment
and
with
his
aid
drew
jorrocks
out
a
bill
which
he
described
as
reaching
down
each
side
of
his
body
and
round
his
waist
commencing
with
francs
for
savon
and
then
proceeding
in
the
daily
routine
of
café
franc
déjeuner
à
la
fourchette
francs
diner
avec
vin
francs
tea
franc
souper
francs
bougies
francs
appartement
francs
running
him
up
a
bill
of
francs
and
when
stubbs
remonstrated
on
the
exorbitance
of
the
charges
she
replied
it
sall
be
sare
as
small
monnaie
as
sail
be
consistent
avec
my
dignified
respectability
you
to
charge
there
seemed
no
help
for
the
matter
so
stubbs
paid
the
balance
while
jorrocks
shocked
at
the
duplicity
of
the
countess
the
impudence
of
rosembom
and
the
emptiness
of
his
own
pockets
bolted
away
without
saying
a
word
that
very
night
the
bore
them
from
the
capital
with
two
cold
fowls
of
a
yard
of
bread
and
a
bottle
of
porter
for
jorrocks
on
the
journey
and
ere
another
sun
went
down
the
sandy
suburbs
of
calais
saw
them
toiling
towards
her
ramparts
and
rumbling
over
the
drawbridges
and
under
the
portcullis
that
guard
the
entrance
to
her
gloomy
town
calais
cold
cheerless
lifeless
calais
whose
soul
has
ever
warmed
as
it
approached
thy
town
but
how
many
hearts
have
turned
with
sickening
sorrow
from
the
mirthless
tinkling
of
thy
bells
we
not
stay
here
long
i
guess
said
jorrocks
as
the
diligence
pulled
up
at
the
and
the
conducteur
requested
the
passengers
to
descend
that
optional
said
a
bystander
who
was
waiting
for
his
letters
looking
at
jorrocks
with
an
air
as
much
as
to
say
what
a
fellow
you
are
and
not
without
reason
for
the
colonel
was
attired
in
a
blue
sailor
jacket
white
leathers
and
with
the
cocked
hat
and
feather
the
speaker
was
a
man
with
a
quick
intelligent
eye
dressed
in
a
green
striped
toilinette
waistcoat
and
drab
trousers
with
a
whip
in
his
hand
thank
you
for
nothing
replied
jorrocks
eyeing
him
in
return
upon
which
the
speaker
turned
to
the
clerk
and
asked
if
there
were
any
letters
for
monsieur
apperley
or
nimrod
nimrod
exclaimed
jorrocks
dropping
on
his
knees
as
though
he
were
shot
oh
my
vig
what
have
i
done
oh
dear
oh
dear
what
a
dumbfounderer
flummoxed
i
declare

nimrod
in
astonishment
why
what
the
matter
now
you
do
owe
me
anything
i
dare
say
owe
you
anything
yes
i
does
said
jorrocks
rising
from
the
ground
i
owes
you
a
debt
of
gratitude
that
i
can
never
wipe
off
you
be
in
the
and
ledger
of
my
memory
for
ever
and
a
year
who
are
you
inquired
nimrod
becoming
more
and
more
puzzled
as
he
contrasted
his
dialect
with
his
dress
who
am
i
why
i
mister
jorrocks
jorrocks
by

who

and
thereupon
they
shook
hands

uncommon
warmth

in
paris

suppose
resumed
nimrod
after
their
respective
digits
were
released
were
you
much
gratified
with
what
you
saw
what
pleased
you
most
the
tuileries
louvre
garden
of
plants
père
la
chaise
notre
dame
or
what
why
now
to
tell
you
the
truth
singular
as
it
may
seem
i
saw
nothing
but
the
tuileries
and
naughty
i
may
say
a
werry
naughty
dame
for
she
fleeced
me
uncommonly
scarcely
leaving
me
a
dump
to
carry
me
home
what
you
been
among
the
ladies
have
you
that
gay
for
a
man

and
made
me

for
their
acquaintance
the
countess
benwolio

her
black
boy

always
on
the
road

by
the
flats
she
catches
between
paris
and
the
coast
she
was
an
agent
for
morison
pills
but
having
a
fractious
scotch
lodger
that
she
could
get
out
she
physicked
him
so
dreadfully
that
he
nearly
died
and
the
police
took
her
licence
away
but
you
are
hungry
jorrocks
come
to
my
house
and
spend
the
evening
and
tell
me
all
about
your
travels
stubbs
objected
to
this
proposition
having
just
learned
that
the
london
packet
sailed
in
an
hour
so
the
trio
adjourned
to
roberts
royal
hotel
where
over
some
strong
they
cemented
their
acquaintance
and
jorrocks
finding
that
nimrod
was
to
be
in
england
the
following
week
insisted
upon
his
naming
a
day
for
dining
in
great
coram
street
permits
to
embark
having
been
considerately
granted
gratis
by
the
government
for
a
franc
apiece
at
the
hour
of
ten
our
travellers
stepped
on
board
and
jorrocks
having
wrapped
himself
up
in
his
martial
cloak
laid
down
in
the
cabin
and
like
ulysses
in
ithaca
as
nimrod
would
say
arrived
in
london
asleep
xi
a
ride
to
brighton
on
the
age
in
a
very
familiar
letter
to
nimrod
dear
nimrod
you
have
favoured
myself
and
the
sporting
world
at
large
with
a
werry
rich
account
of
the
great
captain
barclay
and
his
extonishing
coach

so
they
went
on

the
tune
of
near
a
dozen
presently
a
rattling
of
pole
chains
was
heard
and
a
cry
was
raised
of
here
sir
wincent
i
looks
out
and
saw
a
werry
neat
dark
coach
with
narrow
wheels
and
a
crest
either
a
heagle
or
a
unicorn
i
forgets
which
on

and
just
the
proprietors

below
the

the

in
large
gilt
letters
below
the
gammon
board
drawn
by
four
nags
in
beautiful
highly
polished
harness
with
brass
furniture
without
bearing
reins
driven
by
a
young
chap
in
a
rough
benjamin
with
tyes
and
a
bunch
of
flowers
in
his
no
coachman
or
man
of
fashion
as
you
knows
being
complete
without
the
flower
there
was
nothing
gammonacious
about
the
all
werry
neat
and
but
as
plain
as
plain
could
be
and
there
was
not
even
a
bit
of
christmas
at
the
ears
which
i
observed
all
the
other
coaches

well
down

sir
wincent

and
off

ran
into
the
office
to

sir
wincent
wormed
his
way
among
the
wans
busses
coaches
in
wulgar
french
cow
sur
tate
as
they
calls
the
new
patent
busses
trucks
cabs
in
a
marvellous
workmanlike
manner
which
seemed
the
more
masterly
inasmuch
as
the
leaders
having
their
heads
at
liberty
poked
them
about
in
all
directions
all
a
mode
francey
just
as
they
do
in
paris
at
the
marsh
gate
we
were
stopped
a
black
job
was
going
through
on
one
side
and
a
had
drawn
a
great
yellow
one
gravesend
cruelty
wan
into
the
other
and
was
fumbling
for
his
coin
now
young
omnibus
cried
sir
wincent
do
be
standing
there
all
day
the
man
cut
into
his
nag
but
the
brute
was
about
beat
there
do
him
so
hard
said
sir
wincent
or
you
may
hurt
him
when
we
got
near
the
helephant
and
castle
timothy
odgkinson
of
brixton
hill
a
low
underselling
grocer
got
his
measly
errand
cart
with
his
name
and
address
in
great
staring
white
letters
just
in
advance
of
the
leaders
and
kept
dodging
across
the
road
to
get
the
sound
ground
for
the
whole
line
was
werry
woolley
as
you
calls
it
come
mister
independent
grocer
go
faster
if
you
can
cries
sir
wincent
though
i
think
you
have
bought
your
horse
where
you
buy
your
tea
for
he
werry
sloe
a
little
bit
farther
on
a
chap
was
shoving
away
at
a
truck
full
of
now
slavey
said
he
keep
out
of
my
way
at
the
helephant
and
castle
and
indeed
wherever
he
stopped
there
were
lots
of
gapers
assembled
to
see
the
baronet
coachman
but
sir
wincent
never
minded
them
but
bustled
about
with
his
and
shoved
in
his
parcels
and
like
a
good
we
pulled
up
to
grub
at
the
feathers
at
merstham
and
glad
i
was
for
i
was
far
on
to
famish
having
ridden
whole
miles
in
a
cold
frosty
air
without
morsel
of
wittles
of
any
sort
when
the
bart
pulled
up
he
said
now
ladies
and
gentlemen
twenty
minutes
allowed
here
and
let
me
adwise
you
to
make
the
most
of
it
i
took
the
and
heat
away
like
a
regular
bagman
who
can
always
dispatch
his
ducks
and
green
peas
in
ten
minutes
we
started
again
and
about
one
hundred
yards
below
the
pike
stood
a
lad
with
a
pair
of
leaders
to
clap
on
for
the
road
as
i
said
before
was
werry
woolley
now
you
see
jorrocks
said
sir
wincent
i
do
old
pikey
by
having
my
on
this
side
the
old
screw
drew
me
for
four
shillings
one
day
for
my
leaders
two
each
way
so
says
i
covey
if
you
do
draw
it
a
little
milder
i
send
my
from
the
stable
through
my
friend
sir
william
jolliffe
fields
to
the
other
side
of
your
shop
and
as
he
would
you
see
here
they
are
and
he
gets
nothing
the
best
of
company
they
say
must
part
and
baronets
form
no
exception
to
the
rule
as
i
once
heard
birkbeck
say
about
a
mile
below
the
halfway
another
coach
hove
in
sight
and
each
pulling
up
they
proved
to
be
as
like
each
other
as
two
beans
and
beneath
a
mackintosh
like
a
tent
cover
i
twigged
my
friend
brackenbury
jolly
phiz
how
are
you
jorrocks
and
how
are
you
brack
flew
across
like
while
sir
wincent
handing
me
the
ribbons
said
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
wish
you
all
a
good
morning
and
a
pleasant
ride
and
brack
having
done
the
same
by
his
coach
and
passengers
the
two
heroes
met
on
terry
firmey
as
we
say
in
france
to
exchange
and
directions
about
parcels
now
said
sir
wincent
find
miss
bustle
under
the
front
seat
send
it
off
to
the
marine
parade
the
instant
you
get
in
for
she
wants
it
to
make
herself
up
for
a
party
by
jove
that
lucky
said
brackenbury
for
i
be
hanged
if
i
have
got
old
lady
false
of
ivories
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
which
i
should
have
forgot
if
you
mentioned
things
and
then
the
old
lady
would
have
lost
her
this
christmas
here
they
are
handing
out
a
small
box
and
mind
you
leave
them
yourself
for
they
tell
me
they
are
costly
being
all
fixed
in
coral
with
gold
springs
and
i
do
know
what
warranted
to
eat
of
themselves
they
say
she
has
lost
her
modesty
with
her
teeth
it
seems
said
sir
wincent
old
women
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
be
seen
out
of
their
graves
after
their
grinders
are
gone
i
pound
it
the
old
tabby
car
be
under
one
hundred
but
quick
who

parrot
and
the
belong
to
that
you
got
stuck
up
there
and
look
there
a
canary

like
wombwell

all
the
same
one
hundred
years
all
right
sit
tight
good
night
well
jorrocks
it
long
since
we
met
said
brackenbury
looking
me
over

showed
you

over
the
weald
of
sussex
from
torrington
wood

gallant
wite
with
the
ah
those
were
rare
days
jorrocks
we
shall
never
see
their
like
again
but
you
looking
fresh
time
lays
a
light
hand
on
your
i
hope
it
will
be
long
ere
you
are
booked
by
the
gravesend
buss
you
do
lush
much
i
fancy
added
he
putting
a
lighted
cigar
in
his
mouth
yes
i
does
said
i
a
good
deal
but
i
tells
you
what
brackenbury
i
does
fumigate
none
it
the
fumigation
that
does
the
mischief
and
thereupon
we
commenced
a
hargument
on
the
comparitive
mischief
of
smoking
and
drinking
which
ended
without
either
being
able
to
convince
the
other
well
at
all
events
you
gets
beefey
brackenbury
said
i
you
must
be
a
couple
of
stone
heavier
than
when
we
used
to
talliho
the
together
i
think
i
could
lead
you
over
the
weald
now
at
all
ewents
if
the
fences
were
out
of
the
way
for
i
must
confess
that
brack
was
always
a
terrible
chap
at
the
jumps
and
could
go
where
few
would
follow
we
did
the
journey
within
the
six
hours
werry
good
work
considering
the
load
and
the
state
of
the
roads
no
coach
like
the
age
in
my
opinion
i
was
so
werry
much
pleased
with
brack
driving
that
i
presented
him
with
a
whip
i
put
up
at
jonathan
boxall
the
star
and
garter
one
of
the
pleasantest
and
houses
in
all
brighton
it
is
close
to
the
sea
and
just
by
mahomed
the
shop
i
likes
jonathan
for
he
is
a
sportsman
and
we
spin
a
yarn
together
about
and
how
he
used
to
ride
over
the
moon
when
he
whipped
in
to
john
in
berkshire
but
it
all
talk
with
jonathan
now
for
he
more
like
a
stranded
grampus
now
than
a
in
course
i
brought
down
a
pair
of
kickseys
and
intending
to
have
a
round
with
the
old
muggers
but
the
snow
put
a
stop
to
all
that
i
heard
however
that
both
the
telscombe
tye
and
the
devil
dike
dogs
had
been
running
their
rounds
after
hares
some
of
which
ended
in
captures
others
in
escapes
as
the
newspapers
terms
them
i
dined
at
the
albion
on
christmas
day
and
most
misfortunately
my
appetite
was
ready
before
the
joints
so
i
had
to
make
my
dinner
off
mary
ann
cutlets
i
think
they
call
them
that
is
to
say
chops
screwed
up
in
large
curl
papers
and
trifles
i
saw
some
chaps
drinking
small
glasses
of
stuff
so
i
asked
the
waiter
what
it
was
and
thinking
he
said
elixir
of
girls
i
banged
the
table
and
said
elixir
of
girls
that
the
stuff
for
my
money
give
me
a
glass
the
chap
laughed
and
said
not
girls
sir
but
garus
and
thereupon
he
gave
another
great
guffaw
it
is
a
capital
full
of
winders
and
tables
waiters
in
silk
stockings
and
they
give
spermaceti
cheese
and
burn
parmesan
candles
the
chaps
in
it
however
were
werry
unsociable
and
there
was
a
man
there
that
i
would
borrow
half
a
crown
to
get
drunk
with
stickey
is
the
landlord
but
he
does
not
stick
it
in
so
deep
as
might
be
expected
from
the
looks
of
the
house
and
the
cheese
and
candles
considered
it
was
a
most
tempestersome
night
and
having
eaten
and
drank
to
completion
i
determined
to
go
and
see
if
my
aunt
in
cavendish
street
was
alive
and
after
having
been
nearly
blown
out
to
france
several
times
i
succeeded
in
making
my
point
and
running
to
ground
the
storm
grew
worser
and
worser
and
when
i
came
to
open
the
door
to
go
away
i
found
it
blocked
with
snow
and
the
drifts
whirling
about
in
all
directions
my
aunt
who
is
a
werry
feeling
woman
insisted
on
my
staying
all
night
which
only
made
the
matter
worse
for
when
i
came
to
look
out
in
the
morning
i
found
the
drift
as
high
as
the
first
floor
winder
and
the
street
completely
buried
in
snow
having
breakfasted
and
seeing
no
hopes
of
emancipation
i
hangs
out
a
flag
of
distress
a
red
wipe
which
after
flapping
about
for
some
time
drew
three
or
four
sailors
and
a
or
two
i
explained
from
the
winder
how
dreadfully
i
was
situated
prayed
of
them
to
release
me
but
the
wretches
did
nothing
but
laugh
and
ax
wot
i
would
give
to
be
out
at
last
one
of
them
who
acted
as
spokesman
proposed
that
i
should
put
an
armchair
out
of
the
winder
and
pay
them
five
shillings
each
for
carrying
me
home
on
their
shoulders
it
seemed
a
vast
of
money
but
the
storm
continuing
the
crowd
increasing
and
i
not
wishing
to
kick
up
a
row
at
my
aunt
after
offering
four
and
sixpence
agreed
to
their
terms
and
throwing
out
a
chair
plumped
up
to
the
middle
in
a
drift
three
cheers
followed
the
feat
which
drew
all
the
neighbours
to
the
winders
when
about
half
a
dozen
fellows
some
drunk
some
sober
and
some
pulled
me
into
the
chair
hoisted
me
on
to
their
shoulders
and
proceeded
into
james
street
bellowing
out
the
new
member
for
brighton
here
the
boy
wot
sleeps
in
cavendish
street
huzzah
the
old
for
ever
there
an
elegant
man
for
a
small
who
wants
a
fat
chap
to
send
to
their
friends
this
christmas
the
noise
they
made
was
quite
tremendious
and
the
snow
in
many
places
being
up
to
their
middles
we
made
werry
slow
progress
but
still
they
would
keep
me
in
the
chair
and
before
we
got
to
the
end
of
the
street
the
crowd
had
increased
to
some
hundreds
here
they
began
and
my
hat
and
wig
soon
went
flying
and
then
there
was
a
fresh
holloa
here
wigney
the
member
for
brighton
they
cried
out
i
say
old
boy
are
you
for
the
ballot
you
must
call
on
the
king
this
morning
he
wants
to
give
you
a
just
then
one
of
the
front
bearers
tumbled
and
down
we
all
rolled
into
a
drift
just
opposite
daly
backey
shop
there
were
about
twenty
of
us
in
together
but
being
pretty
near
the
top
i
was
soon
on
my
legs
and
seeing
an
opening
i
bolted
right
forward
sent
three
or
four
fellows
flying
dashed
down
the
passage
behind
saxby
wine
vaults
across
the
steyne
floundering
into
the
drifts
followed
by
the
mob
shouting
and
pelting
me
all
the
way
this
double
made
some
of
the
beggars
the
mark
and
run
past
the
statute
of
george
the
fourth
but
seeing
their
mistake
or
hearing
the
other
portion
of
the
pack
running
in
the
contrary
direction
they
speedily
joined
heads
and
tails
and
gave
me
a
devil
of
a
burst
up
the
narrow
lane
by
the
wite
fortunately
jonathan
boxall
door
was
open
and
jonathan
himself
in
the
passage
bar
washing
some
decanters
look
sharp
jonathan
said
i
dashing
past
him
as
wite
as
a
miller
look
sharp
come
out
of
that
and
be
after
clapping
your
great
carcase
against
the
door
to
keep
the
philistines
out
or
they
be
the
death
of
us
both
quick
as
thought
the
door
was
closed
and
bolted
before
ever
the
leaders
had
got
up
but
finding
this
the
case
the
mob
halted
and
proceeded
to
make
a
deuce
of
a
before
the
house
bellowing
and
shouting
like
mad
fellows
and
threatening
to
pull
it
down
if
i
did
not
show
jonathan
got
narvous
and
begged
and
intreated
me
to
address
them
i
recommended
him
to
do
it
himself
but
he
said
he
was
quite
unaccustomed
to
public
speaking
and
he
would
stand
two
glasses
of
cold
without
if
i
would
hot
with
said
i
and
i
do
it
done
said
he
and
he
knocked
the
snow
off
my
coat
pulled
my
wig
straight
and
made
me
look
decent
and
took
me
to
a
room
on
the
first
floor
threw
up
the
sash
and
exhibited
me
to
the
company
outside
i
bowed
and
kissed
my
hand
like
a
candidate
they
cheered
and
shouted
and
then
called
for
silence
whilst
i
addressed
them
gentlemen
said
i
who
are
you
why
we
be
the
men
wot
carried
your
honour
glory
from
cavendish
street
and
wants
to
be
paid
for
it
gentlemen
said
i
i
no
orator
but
i
a
honest
man
i
pays
everybody
twenty
shillings
in
the
pound
and
no
mistake
cheers
if
you
had
done
your
part
of
the
bargain
i
would
have
done
mine
but
can
you
expect
to
be
paid
after
spilling
me
this
is
a
most
inclement
day
and
whatever
you
may
say
to
the
contrary
i
not
clement
wigney
no
nor
mr
faithful
neither
bellowed
one
of
the
said
i
you
get
the
complaints
of
the
season
chilblains
and
influhensa
if
you
stand
dribbling
there
in
the
snow
let
me
advise
you
to
mizzle
for
if
you
do
i
blowed
if
i
do
divide
a
whole
jug
of
cold
water
equally
amongst
you
go
home
to
your
wives
and
children
and
do
be
after
annoying
an
honest
independent
amiable
publican
like
jonathan
boxall
that
all
i
got
to
say
and
if
i
was
to
talk
till
i
black
in
the
face
i
could
say
nothing
more
to
the
purpose
so
i
wishes
you
all
merry
christmas
and
an
new
year
but
i
fatiguing
you
nimrod
with
all
this
which
is
only
hinteresting
to
the
parties
concerned
so
will
pass
on
to
other
topics
i
saw
the
king
riding
in
his
coach
with
his
sunday
coat
on
he
looked
werry
well
but
his
nose
was
rather
blueish
at
the
end
a
sure
sign
that
he
is
but
a
mortal
and
feels
the
cold
just
like
any
other
man
the
queen
did
not
show
but
i
saw
some
of
her
maids
of
honour
who
made
me
think
of
the
richmond
cheesecakes
there
were
a
host
of
pretty
ladies
and
the
cold
gave
a
little
colour
to
their
noses
too
which
i
think
improved
their
appearance
wastly
for
i
always
remarked
that
your
ladies
of
quality
are
rather
pasty
and
do
not
generally
show
their
high
blood
in
their
cheeks
and
noses
i
werry
fond
of
looking
at
pretty
girls
whether
maids
of
or
maids
of
all
work
the
storm
stopped
all
wisiting
and
even
the
countess
of
ball
was
obliged
to
be
put
off
howsomever
that
did
not
interfere
at
all
with
jonathan
boxall
and
me
except
that
it
perhaps
made
us
take
a
bottom
of
brandy
more
than
usual
particularly
after
jonathan
had
run
over
again
one
of
his
best
runs
now
dear
nimrod
adieu
whenever
you
comes
over
to
england
i
shall
be
werry
to

party
the
general
postman
had
given
the
final
flourish
to
his
bell
and
the
had
just
begun
to
tinkle
hers
when
a
capacious
yellow
with
a
faded
scarlet
was
seen
jolting
down
great
coram
street
and
pulling
up
at
jorrocks
door
before
jarvey
had
time
to
apply
his
hand
to
the

after
giving
the

a
half
to

with
a
blue

and
white

drab

and
black

drew
jorrocks
from
his
where
he
had
been
acting
the
part
of
butler
for
which
purpose
he
had
put
off
his

white
gauze
silk
stockings
white
neckcloth
and
white
waistcoat
with
a
frill
as
large
as

he
shuffled
himself
into
a
smart
new
blue
saxony
coat
with
velvet

and
advanced
into
the

to
hang
up
his
hat
on
a
line
of
pegs
against
the
wall

a
bit
of

replied
jorrocks

a
bit
of

quite
the
contrary

replied
nimrod
eyeing
a
table
full
of

by
where
he
stood
why

marmalade
out
of

nice
new
white
one

green
rims
on
the
tip
of
his
finger
i
won
that
in
a
most
miraculous
manner
a
most
wonderful
way
in
fact
i
was
driving
to
croydon
one
morning
in
my
chay
and
just
as
i
got
to
lilleywhite
the
blacksmith
below
brixton
hill
they
had
thrown
up
a
drain
a
i
may
call
it
across
the
road
for
the
purpose
of
repairing
the
i
was
rayther
late
as
it
was
for
our
are
werry
punctual
and
there
was
nothing
for
me
but
either
to
go
a
mile
and
a
half
about
or
drive
slap
over
the
gulph
well
i
looked
at
it
and
the
more
i
looked
at
it
the
less
i
liked
it
but
just
as
i
was
thinking
i
had
seen
enough
of
it
and
was
going
to
turn
away
up
tools
timothy
truman
in
his
buggy
and
he
too
began
to
crane
and
look
into
the
abyss
and
a
terrible
place
it
was
i
assure
you
quite
frightful
and
he
liked
it
no
better
than
myself
seeing
this
i
takes
courage
and
said
tim
your
will
do
it
j
said
he
follow
you
said
i
you
change
wehicles
for
mind
ye
i
had
no
notion
of
damaging
my
own
bet
you
a
hat

gets
over
said
he
and
out
he
got
so
i
takes
his
by
the
head
looses
the
and
leading
him
quietly
up
to
the
place
and
letting
him
have
a
look
at
it
gave
him
a
whack
over
the
back
and
over
he
went
gig
and
all
as
clever
as
could
be
well
done
j
you
are
really
a
most
wonderful
man
you
have
the
most
extraordinary
adventures
of
any
man
breathing
but
what
did
you
do
with
your
own
machine
oh
you
see
i
just
turned
round
to
binjimin
who
was
with
me
and
said
you
may
go
home
and
getting
into
timothy
buggy
i
had
my
ride
for
nothing
and
the
hat
into
the
bargain
a
nice
hat
it
is
too
regular
beaver
a
guinea
worth
at
least
all
true
what
i
told
you
is
it
binjimin
quite
replied
benjamin
putting
his
thumb
to
his
nose
and
spreading
his
fingers
like
a
fan
as
he
slunk
behind
his
master
but
come
gentlemen
resumed
jorrocks
let
be
after
going
binjimin
announce
the
gentlemen
as
your
missis
taught
you
open
the
door
with
your
left
hand
and
stretch
the
right
towards
her
to
let
the
company
see
the
point
to
make
up
to
the
party
ascend
the
stairs
one
at
a
time
for
the
flight
is
narrow
and
rather
abrupt
and
benjamin
obeying
his
worthy
master
injunctions
threw
open
the
front
door
and
discovered
jorrocks
sitting
in
state
at
a
round
table
with
annuals
and
albums
spread
at
orthodox
distances
around
the
possession
of
this
room
had
long
been
a
bone
of
contention
between
jorrocks
and
his
spouse
but
at
length
they
had
accommodated
matters
by
jorrocks
gaining
undivided
possession
of
the
back
communicating
by
with
the
run
of
the
front
one
equally
with
jorrocks
on
days
a
glance
however
showed
which
was
the
master
and
which
the
mistress
room
the
front
one
was
papered
with
weeping
willows
bending
under
the
weight
of
ripe
cherries
on
a
white
ground
and
the
chair
cushions
were
covered
with
cotton
velvet
with
yellow
worsted
bindings
the
round
table
was
made
of
rosewood
and
there
was
a
whatnot
on
the
right
of
the
of
similar
material
containing
a
collection
of
sir
walter
scott
works
in
wood
the
consisted
of
most
dashing
bouquets
of
flowers
in
winding
french
horns
on
a
very
light
drab
ground
so
light
indeed
that
jorrocks
was
never
allowed
to
tread
upon
it
except
in
pumps
or
slippers
the
were
made
of
foxes
brushes
and
in
the
frame
of
the
above
the
white
marble
mantelpiece
were
stuck
notes
of
invitation
thanks
for
obliging
inquiries
etc
the
exhibited
a
bright
yellow
tiger
with
pink
eyes
on
a
blue
ground
with
a
flossy
green
border
and
the
fender
and
were
of
shining
brass
on
the
wall
immediately
opposite
the
was
a
portrait
of
jorrocks
before
she
was
married
so
unlike
her
present
self
that
no
one
would
have
taken
it
for
her
the
back
which
looked
out
upon
the
gravel
walk
and
beyond
was
papered
with
broad
scarlet
and
green
stripes
in
honour
of
the
surrey
hunt
uniform
and
was
set
out
with
a
library
table
in
the
centre
with
a
red
morocco
between
it
and
the
window
and
several
good
strong
mahogany
chairs
around
the
walls
the
table
had
a
very
literary
air
being
strewed
with
sporting
magazines
odd
numbers
of
pamphlets
and
papers
of
various
descriptions
while
on
a
sheet
of
foolscap
on
the
portfolio
were
ten
lines
of
an
elegy
on
a
giblet
pie
which
had
been
broken
in
coming
from
the
baker
at
which
jorrocks
had
been
hammering
for
some
time
on
the
side
opposite
the
on
a
hanging
range
of
mahogany
shelves
were
ten
volumes
of
life
in
the
sporting
bound
gilt
and
lettered
the
of
harriette
wilson
taplin
nimrod
of
and
a
backgammon
board
that
jorrocks
had
bought
by
mistake
for
a
history
of
england
jorrocks
as
we
said
before
was
sitting
in
state
at
the
far
side
of
the
round
table
on
a
ottoman
exhibiting
a
cock
pheasant
on
a
white
ground
and
was
fanning
herself
with
a
paper
fan
and
turning
over
the
leaves
of
an
annual
how
jorrocks
happened
to
marry
her
no
one
could
ever
divine
for
she
never
was
pretty
had
very
little
money
and
not
even
a
decent
figure
to
recommend
her
it
was
generally
supposed
at
the
time
that
his
brother
joe
and
he
having
had
a
deadly
feud
about
a
bottom
piece
of
muffin
the
friends
had
talked
him
into
the
match
in
the
hopes
of
his
having
a
family
to
leave
his
money
to
instead
of
bequeathing
it
to
joe
or
his
children
certain
it
is
they
never
were
meant
for
each
other
jorrocks
as
our
readers
have
seen
being
all
nature
and
impulse
while
jorrocks
was
all
vanity
and
affectation
to
describe
her
accurately
is
more
than
we
can
pretend
to
for
she
looked
so
different
in
different
dresses
that
jorrocks
himself
sometimes
did
not
recognise
her
her
face
was
round
with
a
good
strong
sort
of
complexion
a
nose
eyes
that
were
grey
in
one
light
and
green
in
another
and
a
mouth
with
a
double
chin
below
jorrocks
used
to
say
that
she
was
warranted
to
him
as
twelve
years
younger
than
himself
but
many
people
supposed
the
difference
of
age
between
them
was
not
so
great
her
stature
was
of
the
middle
height
and
she
was
of
one
breadth
from
the
shoulders
to
the
heels
she
was
dressed
in
a
flaming
scarlet
satin
gown
with
round
the
top
as
also
at
the
arms
and
two
flounces
of
the
same
material
round
the
bottom
her
turban
was
of
green
velvet
with
a
gold
fringe
terminating
in
a
bunch
over
the
left
side
while
a
inclined
towards
the
right
across
her
forehead
she
wore
a
gold
band
with
a
glass
butterfly
a
present
from
james
green
and
her
neck
arms
waist
at
least
what
ought
to
have
been
her
waist
were
hung
round
and
studded
with
chains
brooches
rings
buttons
bracelets
looking
for
all
the
world
like
a
portable
pawnbroker
shop
or
the
lump
of
beef
that
sinbad
the
sailor
threw
into
the
valley
of
diamonds
in
the
right
of
a
gold
band
round
her
middle
was
an
immense
gold
watch
with
a
bunch
of
mosaic
seals
appended
to
a
massive
chain
of
the
same
material
and
a
large
miniature
of
jorrocks
when
he
was
a
young
man
with
his
hair
stiffly
curled
occupied
a
place
on
her
left
side
on
her
right
arm
dangled
a
green
velvet
bag
with
a
gold
cord
out
of
which
one
of
jorrocks
silk
handkerchiefs
protruded
while
a
crumpled
cambric
one
with
a
lace
fringe
lay
at
her
side
on
an
stool
a
little
behind
jorrocks
sat
her
niece
belinda
joe
jorrocks
eldest
daughter
a
nice
laughing
pretty
girl
of
sixteen
with
languishing
blue
eyes
brown
hair
a
nose
of
the
order
beautiful
mouth
and
teeth
a
very
fair
complexion
and
a
gracefully
moulded
figure
she
had
just
left
one
of
the
finishing
and
polishing
seminaries
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bromley
where
for
two
hundred
a
year
and
upwards
all
the
teasing
accomplishments
of
life
are
taught
and
jorrocks
in
her
own
mind
had
already
appropriated
her
to
james
green
while
jorrocks
on
the
other
hand
had
assigned
her
to
stubbs
belinda
dress
was
simplicity
itself
her
silken
hair
hung
in
shining
tresses
down
her
smiling
face
confined
by
a
plain
tortoiseshell
comb
behind
and
a
narrow
pink
velvet
band
before
round
her
neck
was
a
plain
white
cornelian
necklace
and
her
white
muslin
frock
confined
by
a
pink
sash
flowing
behind
in
a
bow
met
in
simple
folds
across
her
swelling
bosom
black
sandal
shoes
confined
her
fairy
feet
and
with
french
cotton
stockings
completed
her
toilette
belinda
though
young
was
a
celebrated
eastern
beauty
and
there
was
not
a
butcher
boy
in
whitechapel
from
michael
scales
downwards
but
what
eyed
her
with
delight
as
she
passed
along
from
shoreditch
on
her
daily
walk
the
presentations
having
been
effected
and
the
heat
of
the
day
the
excellence
of
the
house
the
cleanliness
of
great
coram
street
the
usual
topics
in
short
when
people
know
nothing
of
each
other
having
been
discussed
our
party
scattered
themselves
about
the
room
to
await
the
pleasing
announcement
of
dinner
jorrocks
of
course
was
in
attendance
upon
nimrod
while
stubbs
made
love
to
belinda
behind
jorrocks
presently
a
loud
at
the
street
door
sounded
through
the
house
and
jorrocks
with
a
slap
on
his
thigh
exclaimed
by
jingo
there
green
no
man
knocks
with
such
wigorous
wiolence
as
he
does
all

ye
nodding
to
the
yorkshireman
as
he
jerked
himself
on
to
a
chair
on
the
other
side
of
belinda
as
usual
green
was
as
gay
as
a
peacock
his
curly
flaxen
wig
projected
over
his
forehead
like
the
roof
of
a
swiss
cottage
and
his
pointed
gills
were
supported
by
a
stiff
black
mohair
stock
with
a
broad
front
and
black
frill
confined
with
jet
studs
down
the
centre
his
coat
was
light
green
with
archery
buttons
made
very
wide
at
the
hips
with
which
he
sported
a
white
waistcoat
bright
yellow
ochre
leather
trousers
pink
silk
stockings
and
pumps
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
white
silk
handkerchief
which
smelt
most
powerfully
of
musk
and
a
pair
of
dirty
wristbands
drew
the
eye
to
sundry
dashing
rings
upon
his
fingers
jonathan
crane
a
little
old
city
a
member
of
the
surrey
hunt
being
announced
and
presented
jorrocks
declared
herself
faint
from
the
heat
of
the
room
and
begged
to
be
excused
for
a
few
minutes
nimrod
all
politeness
was
about
to
offer
her
his
arm
but
jorrocks
pulled
him
back
whispering
let
her
go
let
her
go
the
fact
is
said
he
in
an
undertone
after
she
was
out
of
hearing
it
a
way
j
has
when
she
wants
to
see
that
dinner
all
right
you
see
she
a
terrible
woman
being
a
cross
between
a
and
a
and
does
like
to
be
supposed
to
look
after
these
things
so
when
she
goes
she
always
pretend
to
faint
you
see
her
back
presently
and
just
as
he
spoke
in
she
came
with
a
at
her
nose
benjamin
followed
immediately
after
and
throwing
open
the
door
proclaimed
in
a
voice
that
dinner
was
sarved
upon
which
the
party
all
started
on
their
legs
now

wulgar

what
matter

make
to
your
friends
where
the
windmill
comes
from
exclaimed
jorrocks
in
an
audible
voice
from
below
nimrod
with
admirable
skill
having
piloted
her
down
the
straights
and
turns
of
the
staircase
having
squeezed
herself
between
the
backs
of
the
chairs
and
the
wall
jorrocks
at
length
reached
the
head
of
the
table
and
with
a
bump
of
her
body
and
wave
of
her
hand
motioned
nimrod
to
take
the
seat
on
her
right
green
then
pushed
past
belinda
and
stubbs
and
took
the
place
on
jorrocks
left
so
stubbs
with
a
dexterous
manoeuvre
placed
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
table
with
belinda
between
himself
and
her
uncle
crane
and
spiers
then
filled

we
have
repeatedly
decided
that

toss
the
was
the
breadth
of
the
passage
narrower
than
the
front
and
as
jorrocks
truly
said
was
rayther
small
but
the
table
being
excessively
broad
made
the
room
appear
less
than
it
was
it
was
lighted
up
with
spermaceti
candles
in
silver
holders
one
at
each
corner
of
the
table
and
there
was
a
lamp
in
the
wall
between
the
windows
immediately
below
a
brass
nail
on
which
jorrocks
great
and
a
bunch
of
boot
garters
were
hung
two
more
candles
in

on

and

occupied
a
frame
on
the

the
cellaret
sideboard
against
the
wall
at
the
end
supported
a
large
brass
lamp
with
raised
foxes
round
the
rim
whose
effulgent
rays
shed
a
brilliant
halo
over
eight
black
hats
and
two
white
ones
whereof
the
four
middle
ones
were
decorated
with
evergreens
and
foxes
brushes
the
dinner
table
was
crowded
not
covered
there
was
scarcely
a
square
inch
of
cloth
to
be
seen
on
any
part
in
the
centre
stood
a
magnificent
finely
spun
windmill
two
feet
and
a
half
high
with
a
spacious
sugar
foundation
with
a
cart
and
horses
and
two

first

course
everything
in
fact
except
dessert
was
on
the
table
as
we
sometimes
see
it
at
ordinaries
and
public
dinners
before
both
and
jorrocks
were
two
great
tureens
of
soup
each
capable
of
holding
a
gallon
and
both
full
up
to
the
brim
then
there
were
two
sorts
of
fish
turbot
and
lobster
sauce
and
a
great
salmon
a
round
of
boiled
beef
and
an
immense
piece
of
roast
occupied
the
rear
of
these
ready
to
march
on
the
disappearance
of
the
fish
and
soup
and
behind
the
walls
formed
by
the
beef
of
old
england
came
two
dishes
of
grouse
each
dish
holding
three

consisted
of
a

a
single
but
very
resolute
knock
at
the
street
door
sounding
quite
through
the
house
stopped
all
further
ebullition
and
benjamin
slipping
out
held
a
short
conversation
with
someone
in
the
street
and
returned
what

melted
long
before
it
came
to
their
turn
to
be
eat
at
length
everyone
jorrocks
and
all
appeared
satisfied
and
the
noise
of
knives
and
forks
was
succeeded
by
the
din
of
tongues
and
the
ringing
of
glasses
as
the
eaters
refreshed
themselves
with
wine
or
malt
liquors
cheese
and
biscuit
being
handed
about
on

the
of

jorrocks
began
to
grunt
hem
and
haw
and
kick
the
leg
of
the
table
by
way
of
giving
her
a
hint
to
depart
this
caused
a
dead
silence
which
at
length
was
broken
by
the
yorkshireman
exclaiming

of
england

i
give

the
health
of
happerley
nimrod
drunk
with
three
times

when
the
cheering
and
dancing
of
the
glasses
had
somewhat
subsided
nimrod
rose
and
spoke
as
follows
jorrocks
and
gentlemen
the
handsome
manner
in
which
my
health
has
been
proposed
by
our
worthy
and
estimable
host
and
the
flattering
reception
it
has
met
with
from
you
merit
my
warmest
acknowledgments
i
should
indeed
be
unworthy
of
the
land
which
gave
me
birth
were
i
insensible
of
the
honour
which
has
just
been
done
me
by
so
enlightened
and
distinguished
an
assembly
as
the
present
my
friend
jorrocks
has
been
pleased
to
designate
me
as
one
of
the
most
distinguished
sportsmen
of
the
day
a
title
however
to
which
i
feel
i
have
little
claim
but
this
i
may
say
that
i
have
portrayed
our
great
national
sports
in
their
brightest
and
most
glowing
colours
and
that
on
sporting
subjects
my
pen
shall
yield
to
none
cheers
i
have
ever
been
the
decided
advocate
of
many
sports
and
exercises
not
only
on
account
of
the
health
and
vigour
they
inspire
but
because
i
feel
that
they
are
the
best
safeguards
on
a
energies
and
the
best
protection
against
luxury
idleness
debauchery
and
effeminacy
cheers
the
authority
of
all
history
informs
us
that
the
energies
of
countries
flourished
whilst
manly
sports
have
flourished
and
decayed
as
they
died
away
cheers
what
says
juvenal
when
speaking
of
the
entry
of
luxury
into
rome
saevior
armis
luxuria
incubuit
victumque
ulciscitur
orbem
and
we
need
only
refer
to
ancient
history
and
to
the
writings
of
xenophon
cicero
horace
or
virgil
for
evidence
of
the
value
they
have
all
attached
to
the
encouragement
of
manly
active
and
hardy
pursuits
and
the
evils
produced
by
a
degenerate
and
effeminate
life
on
the
manners
and
characters
of
a
people
cheers
many
of
the
most
eminent
literary
characters
of
this
and
of
other
countries
have
been
ardently
attached
to
field
sports
and
who
that
has
experienced
their
beneficial
results
can
doubt
that
they
are
the
best
promoters
of
the
sana
in
corpore
the
body
sound
and
the
understanding
clear
cheers
gentlemen
it
is
with
feelings
of
no
ordinary
gratification
that
i
find
myself
at
the
social
and
truly
hospitable
board
of
one
of
the
most
distinguished
ornaments
of
one
of
the
most
celebrated
hunts
in
this
great
country
one
whose
name
and
fame
have
reached
the
four
corners
of
the
globe
to
find
myself
after
so
long
an
absence
from
my
native
land
an
estrangement
from
all
that
has
ever
been
nearest
and
dearest
to
my
heart
once
again
surrounded
by
these
cheerful
countenances
which
so
well
express
the
honest
healthful
pursuits
of
their
owners
let
us
then
added
nimrod
seizing
a
decanter
and
pouring
himself
out
a
bumper
drink
in
true
kentish
fire
the
health
and
prosperity
of
that
brightest
sample
of
civic
sportsmen
the
great
and
renowned
john
jorrocks
immense
applause
followed
the
conclusion
of
this
speech
during
which
time
the
decanters
buzzed
round
the
table
and
the
glasses
being
emptied
the
company
rose
and
a
full
charge
of
kentish
fire
followed
jorrocks
sitting
all
the
while
looking
as
uncomfortable
as
men
in
his
situation
generally
do
the
cheering
having
subsided
and
the
parties
having
resumed
their
seats
it
was
his
turn
to
rise
so
getting
on
his
legs
he
essayed
to
speak
but
finding
as
many
men
do
that
his
ideas
deserted
him
the
moment
the
eyes
of
england
were
turned
upon
him
after
two
or
three
hitches
of
his
nankeens
and
as
many
hems
and
haws
he
very
coolly
resumed
his
seat
and
spoke
as
follows
gentlemen
unaccustomed
as
i
am
to
public
speaking
i
am
taken
quite
aback
by
this
werry
unexpected
compliment
cheers
never
since
i
filled
the
hancient
and
honerable
hoffice
of
churchwarden
in
the
populous
parish
of
botolph
without
have
i
experienced
a
gratification
equal
to
the
present
i
thank
you
from
the
werry
bottom
of
my
applause
gentlemen
i
no
horator
but
i
a
honest
man
cheers
i
should
indeed
be
undeserving
the
name
of
a
sportsman
undeserving
of
being
a
member
of
that
great
and
justly
celebrated
of
which
happerley
nimrod
has
spun
so
handsome
and
flattering
a
yarn
if
i
did
not
feel
deeply
proud
of
the
compliment
you
have
paid
it
it
is
unpossible
for
me
to
follow
that
great
sporting
scholar
fairly
over
the
ridge
and
furrow
of
his
werry
intricate
and
elegant
horation
for
there
are
many
of
those
fine
gentlemen
names
french
i
presume
that
he
mentioned
that
i
never
heard
of
before
and
can
not
recollect
but
if
you
will
allow
me
to
run
a
little
i
would
make
a
few
hobservations
on
a
few
of
his
mr
happerley
nimrod
gentlemen
was
pleased
to
pay
a
compliment
to
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
my
something
i
am
extremely
obliged
to
him
for
it
to
be
surrounded
by
one
friends
is
in
my
mind
the
of
cheers
gentlemen
i
am
most
proud
of
the
honour
of
seeing
you
all
here
and
i
hope
the
grub
has
been
to
your
likin
cheers
if
not
discharge
my
butcher
on
the
score
of
quantity
there
might
be
a
little
deficiency
but
i
hope
the
quality
was
prime
another
time
this
shall
be
all
remedied
cheers
gentlemen
i
understand
those
cheers
and
flattered
by
them
i
likes
i
not
the
man
to
keep
my
butter
in
a
or
my
coals
in
a
quart
pot
immense
cheering
gentlemen
these
are
my
sentiments
i
leaves
the
flowers
of
speech
to
them
as
is
better
acquainted
with
botany
laughter
i
likes
plain
english
both
in
eating
and
talking
and
i
happy
to
see
happerley
nimrod
has
not
forgot
his
and
can
put
up
with
our
homely
fare
and
do
without
pantaloon
cutlets
blankets
of
woe
and
miseries

if

if
it

i

you
our

most
thanks
for

just
paid

to
assure
you
that
the

and
approbation
of

to
us
the
magnum
bonum
of
all
earthly
cheers
and
laughter
gentlemen
i
will
not
trespass
longer
upon
your
valuable
time
but
as
you
seem
to
enjoy
this
wine
of
my
friend
jorrocks
i
may
just
say
that
i
have
got
some
more
of
the
same
quality
left
at
from
to
shillings
a
dozen
also
some
good
stout

sixpence
a

some
ditto
werry
superior
at

also
foreign
and
british
spirits
and
dutch
liqueurs
rich
and
rare
the
conclusion
of
the
vintner
address
was
drowned
in
shouts
of
laughter
jorrocks
then
called
upon
the
company
in
succession
for
a
toast
a
song
or
a
sentiment
nimrod
gave
the
royal
staghounds
crane
gave
champagne
to
our
real
friends
and
real

to
our

friends
green

gave
honest
men
and
bonnie
lasses
and
spiers
like
a
patriotic
printer
gave
the
liberty
of
the
press
which
he
said
was
like
if
we
have
it
not
we
die
all
of
which
jorrocks
applauded
as
if
he
had
never
heard
them
before
and
drank
in
bumpers
it
was
evident
that
unless
tea
was
speedily
announced
he
would
soon
become
the
ills
of
life
victorious
for
he
had
pocketed
his
wig
and
had
been
clipping
the
queen
english
for
some
time
after
a
pause
during
which
his
cheeks
twice
changed
colour
from
red
to
green
and
back
to
red
he
again
called
for
a
bumper
toast
which
he
prefaced
with
the
following
speech
or

three

he
then
attempted
to
rise
for
the
purpose
of
marking
the
time
but
his
legs
deserted
his
body
and
after
two
or
three
lurches
down
he
went
with
a
tremendous
thump
under
the
table
he
called

for

coram
street
in
my
way
my
heart
misgave
me
when
i
recollected
j
and
her
horrid
paws
but
still
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
see
how
the
grocer
was
after
his
fall
arrived
at
the
house
i
rang
the
area
bell
and
benjamin
who
was
cleaning
knives
below

his
head
up
and
seeing
who
it
was
ran
upstairs
and
opened
the
door
his
master
was
up

said
but
werry
bad
and
his
misses

out
leaving
him
to
resume
his
occupation
i
slipped
quietly
upstairs
and
hearing
a
noise
in
the
bedroom
opened
the
door
and
found
jorrocks
sitting
in
his
in
an
easy
chair
with
betsey
patting
his
bald
head
with
a
damp
towel

quiet
for
i
really

werry
bad

by
mistake
let
go
to
the
eel
pye
at
twickenham
and
live
upon
fish
fish
you
old
flat

you
know
you

the
first
to
cry
out
if
you
had
to
do
so
no

no
humbug
here
drink
your
coffee
like
a
man
and
then
hustle
your
purse
and
see
what
it
will
produce
why
even
betsey
laughing
at
the
idea
of
your
living
upon
fish
do
shout
so
pray
your
woice
shoots
through
every
nerve
of
my
head
and
distracts
me
drinks
this
is
grand
mocho
quite
the
cordial
balm
of
gilead
werry
fine
indeed

rewived

listen
to
you
well
then
pull
on
your
boots
gird
up
your
loins
and
let
go
and
spend
this
five
pounds
stay

as
long
as

the
coin
it
mine
you
know
and
let
me
be
paymaster
or
i
know
you
soon
be
into
dock
again
that
right
and
now
i
have
got
three
besides
which
i
will
add
and
i
got
three
pence
which
not
to
be
in
point
of
liberality
i
do
the
same
with
so
that
we
have
got
five
pounds
seven
shillings
and
ninepence
between
us
according
to
cocker
between
us
indeed
i
likes
that
you
a
generous
churchwarden
well
we
wo
stand
upon
trifles
the
principle
is
the
thing
i
look
to
and
not
the
amount
so
now
where
to
your
honour
after
a
long
parley
we
fixed
upon
herne
bay
our
reasons
for
doing
so
were
numerous
though
it
would
be
superfluous
to
mention
them
save
that
the
circumstance
of
neither
of
us
ever
having
been
there
and
the
prospect
of
finding
a
quiet
retreat
for
jorrocks
to
recover
in
were
the
principal
ones
our
arrangements
were
soon
made
batsay
said
j
to
his
principessa
of
a
cook
slut
and
butler
the
yorkshireman
and
i
are
going
out
of
town
to
stay
five
pounds
seven
and
ninepence
so
put
up
my
traps
two
shirts
one
to
wash
the
other
as
he
said
three
pairs
of
stockings
with
other
etceteras
were
stamped
into
a
and
taking
a
cab
we
called
at
the
piazza
where
i
took
a
few
things
and
away
we
drove
to
temple
bar
stop
here
with
the
bags
said
jorrocks
while
i
go
to
the
temple
stairs
and
make
a
bargain
with
a
jacob
faithful
to
put
us
on
board
for
if
they
see
the
bags
they
think
a
case
of
necessity
and
ask
double
whereas
i
pretend
i
just
going
and
when
i
made
a
bargain
i
whistle
and
you
can
come
away
he
rolled
and
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
i
heard
a
sort
of
and
obeying
the
summons
found
he
had
concluded
a
bargain
for
one
and
sixpence
we
reached
docks
just
as
the
herne
bay
boat
the
moored
alongside
consequently
were
nearly
the
first
on
board
herne
bay
being
then
quite
in
its
infancy
and
this
being
what
the
cits
call
a
weekday
they
had
rather
a
shy
cargo
nor
had
they
any
of
that
cockney
tomfoolery
that
generally
characterises
a
ramsgate
or
margate
crew
more
particularly
a
margate
one
indeed
it
was
a
very
slow
cargo
jorrocks
being
the
only
character
on
board
and
he
was
as
sulky
as
a
bear
with
a
sore
head
when
anyone
approached
the
day
was
beautifully
fine
and
a
thin
grey
mist
gradually
disappeared
from
the
kentish
hills
as
we
passed
down
the
thames
the
river
was
gay
enough
adelaide
queen
of
great
britain
and
ireland
was
expected
on
her
return
from
germany
and
all
the
vessels
hung
out
their
best
and
gayest
flags
and
colours
to
do
her
honour
the
towns
of
greenwich
and
woolwich
were
in
commotion
charity
schools
were
marching
and
soldiers
were
doing
the
like
while
steamboats
went
puffing
down
the
river
with
cargoes
to
meet
and
escort
her
majesty
when
we
got
near
tilbury
fort
a
man
at
the
head
of
the
steamer
announced
that
we
should
meet
the
queen
in
ten
minutes
and
all
the
passengers
crowded
on
to
the
of
the
side
on
which
she
was
to
pass
to
view
and
greet
her
jorrocks
even
roused
himself
up
and
joined
the
throng
presently
a
crowd
of
steamers
were
seen
in
the
distance
proceeding
up
the
river
at
a
rapid
pace
with
a
couple
of
vessels
in
tow
the
first
of
which
contained
the
royal
cargo
the
leading
steamboat
was
the
celebrated
considered
the
fastest
boat
on
the
river
and
the
one
in
which
jorrocks
and
myself
steamed
from
margate
racing
against
and
beating
the
this
had
the
lord
mayor
and
aldermen
on
board
who
had
gone
down
to
the
extent
of
the
city
jurisdiction
to
meet
the
queen
and
have
an
excuse
for
a
good
dinner
the
deck
presented
a
gay
scene
being
covered
with
a
military
band
and
the
lackeys
belonging
to
the
mansion
house
and
sheriffs
whose
clothes
were
one
continuous
mass
of
gold
lace
and
frippery
shining
beautifully
brilliant
in
the
midday
sun
the
royal
yacht
with
its
crimson
and
gold
pennant
floating
on
the
breeze
came
towering
up
at
a
rapid
pace
with
the
queen
sitting
under
a
canopy
on
deck
as
we
neared
all
hats
were
off
and
three
cheers
or
at
least
as
many
as
we
could
wedge
in
during
the
time
the
cortège
took
to
sweep
past
us
were
given
our
band
consisting
of
three
musicians
striking
up
save
the
a
compliment
which
her
majesty
acknowledged
by
a
little
mandarining
and
before
the
majority
of
the
passengers
had
recovered
from
the
astonishment
produced
by
meeting
a
live
queen
on
the
thames
the
whole
fleet
had
shot
out
of
sight
by
the
time
the
ripple
on
the
water
raised
by
their
progress
had
subsided
we
had
all
relapsed
into
our
former
state
of
apathy
and
sullenness
a
duller
or
staider
set
i
never
saw
outside
a
quakers
meeting
still
the
beggars
eat
as
when
does
a
cockney
not
in
the
open
air
the
stewards
of
these
steamboats
must
make
a
rare
thing
of
their
places
for
they
have
plenty
of
custom
at
their
own
prices
in
fact
being
in
a
steamboat
is
a
species
of
personal
incarceration
and
you
have
only
the
option
between
bringing
your
own
prog
or
taking
theirs
at
whatever
they
choose
to
charge
unless
indeed
a
person
prefers
going
without
any
jorrocks
took
nothing
he
laid
down
again
after
the
queen
had
passed
and
never
looked
up
until
we
were
a
mile
or
two
off
herne
bay
with
the
reader
permission
we
will
suppose
that
we
have
just
landed
and
bags
in
hand
ascended
the
flight
of
steps
that
conduct
passengers
as
it
were
from
the
briny
ocean
on
to
the
stage
of
life
my
eyes
said
jorrocks
as
he
reached
the
top
wot
a
pier
and
wot
a
bit
of
a
place
why
there
do
seem
to
be
fifty
houses
altogether
reckoning
the
windmill
in
the
centre
as
one
what
this
thing
said
he
to
a
pointing
to
a
sort
of
french
concern
which
had
just
been
pushed
up
to
the
landing
end
to
carry
the
lumber
sir
live
and
dead
gentlemen
and
their
bags
as
do
like
to
walk
do
you
charge
anything
for
the
ride
inquired
jorrocks
with
his
customary
caution
nothing
was
the
answer
then
let
get
on
the
roof
said
j
and
take
it
easy
and
survey
the
place
as
we
go
along
so
accordingly
we
clambered
on
to
the
top
of
the
diligence
summâ
diligentiâ
and
seated
ourselves
on
a
pile
of
luggage
being
all
stowed
away
and
as
many
passengers
as
it
would
hold
put
inside
two
or
three
porters
proceeded
to
propel
the
machine
along
the
railroad
on
which
it
runs
now
yorkshireman
said
jorrocks
we
are
in
a
strange
land
and
it
behoves
us
to
proceed
with
caution
or
we
may
spend
our
five
pounds
seven
and
sixpence
before
we
know
where
we
are
seven
and
ninepence
it
is
sir
well
be
it
so
five
pounds
seven
and
ninepence
between
two
is
by
no
means
an
impossible
sum
to
spend
and
the
trick
is
to
make
it
go
as
far
as
we
can
now
some
men
can
make
one
guinea
go
as
far
as
others
can
make
two
and
we
will
try
what
we
can
do
in
the
first
place
you
know
i
makes
it
a
rule
never
to
darken
the
door
of
a
place
wot
calls
itself
an
for
prices
and
inn
prices
are
werry
different
you
young
chaps
do
consider
these
things
and
as
long
as
you
have
got
a
rap
in
the
world
you
go
swaggering
about
ordering
claret
and
waxlights
and
everything
wot
expensive
as
though
you
must
spend
money
because
you
are
in
an
inn
now
that
all
gammon
if
a
man
have
got
money
he
ca
spend
it
and
we
all
know
that
many
poor
folks
are
obliged
at
times
to
go
to
houses
of
public
entertainment
and
you
do
suppose
that
they
pay
for
fire
and
waxlights
private
and
all
them
sort
of
things
now
said
he
adjusting
his
hunting
telescope
and
raking
the
town
of
herne
bay
towards
which
we
were
gently
approaching
on
our
dignified
eminence
but
as
yet
had
not
got
near
enough
to
descry
what
was
what
with
the
naked
eye
i
should
say
yon
great
shop
directly
opposite
us
is
the
cock
inn
of
the
place
looks
through
his
glass
i
right
pier
i
reads
upon
the
top
and
that
no
shop
for
my
money
let
see
what
else
we
have
there
nothing
on
the
right
i
think
but
here
on
the
left
is
something
like
our
cut
dol
phin
dolphin
inn
it
long
since
i
went
the
circuit
as
the
commercial
gentlemen
or
what
were
called
bagmen
in
my
days
term
it
but
i
have
forgot
the
experience
i
gained
in
my
travels
and
i
whiles
turn
it
to
werry
good
account
now
coach
to
canterbury

margate
sir
going
directly
interrupted
him
and
reminded
us
that
we
had
got
to
the
end
of
the
pier
and
ought
to
be
descending
two
or
three
coaches
were
drawn
up
waiting
to
carry
passengers
on
but
we
had
got
to
our
journey
end
now
said
j
let
take
our
bags
in
hand
and
draw
up
wind
trying
the
first
rejecting
the
noble
portals
of
the
pier
hotel
we
advanced
towards
jorrocks
chosen
house
a
plain
place
facing
the
sea
which
is
half
the
battle
and
being
but
just
finished
had
every
chance
of
cleanliness
jonathan
acres
appeared
above
the
door
as
the
name
of
the
landlord
and
a
little
hatless
chap
in
a
was
leaning
against
the
door
hacres
within
said
jorrocks
my
name
acres
said
he
of
the
humph
said
j
looking
him
over
not
long
acre
i
think
having
selected
a
couple
of
good
airy
bedrooms
we
proceeded
to
see
about
dinner
hacres
said
jorrocks
i
makes
it
a
rule
never
to
pay
more
than
two
and
sixpence
for
a
feed
so
now
just
give
us
as
good
a
one
as
you
possibly
can
for
that
money
and
about
seven
we
sat
down
to
ducks
french
beans
pudding
etc
shortly
after
which
jorrocks
retired
to
rest
to
sleep
off
the
remainder
of
his
headache
he
was
up
long
before
me
the
next
morning
and
had
a
dip
in
the
sea
before
i
came
down
upon
my
word
said
he
as
i
entered
the
room
and
found
him
looking
as
lively
and
fresh
as
a
it
worth
while
going
to
the
occasionally
if
it
only
for
the
pleasure
of
feeling
so
hearty
and
fresh
as
one
does
on
the
second
day
i
feel
just
as
if
i
could
jump
out
of
my
skin
but
i
will
defer
the
performance
until
after
breakfast
i
have
ordered
a
fork
one
do
you
know
cold
and
boiled
bacon
with
no
end
of
eggs
and
bread
of
every
possible
description
by
the
way
i
scraped
acquaintance
with
thorp
the
baker
hard
by
who
a
right
good
fellow
and
says
he
will
give
me
some
shooting
and
has
some
werry
nice
beagles
wot
he
shoots
to
but
here
the
grub
cold
in
abundance
but
waiter
you
should
put
a
little
green
garnishing
to
the
dishes
i
likes
to
see
it
green
is
so
werry
refreshing
to
the
eye
and
tell
hacres
to
send
up
some
more
bacon
and
the
bill
when
i
rings
the
bell
nothing
like
having
your
bill
the
first
morning
and
then
you
know
what
you
got
to
pay
and
can
cut
your
coat
according
to
your
cloth
the
bacon
soon
disappeared
and
the
bell
being
sounded
produced
the
order
humph
said
j
casting
his
eyes
over
the
bill
as
it
lay
by
the
side
of
his
plate
while
he
kept
pegging
away
at
the
contents
of
the
neighbouring
dish
pretty
reasonable
i
think
dinners
five
shillings
that
half
a
crown
each
beds
two
shillings
each
breakfasts
one
and
ninepence
each
that
cheap
for
a
fork
breakfast
but
i
say
you
had
a
pint
of
sherry
after
i
left
you
last
night
and
pale
sherry
too
how
could
you
be
such
an
egreggorus
egregious
ass
that
so
like
you
young
chaps
not
to
know
that
the
only
difference
between
pale
and
brown
sherry
is
that
one
has
more
of
the
pumpaganus
aqua
in
it
than
the
other
you
should
have
made
it
pale
yourself
man
but
look
there
wot
a
go
our
attention
was
attracted
to
a
youth
in
spectacles
dressed
in
a
rich
coat
on
the
outside
of
a
brown
nag
which
he
was
flogging
and
cramming
along
the
public
walk
in
front
of
the
dolphin
in
the
most
original
and
ludicrous
manner
we
presently
recognised
him
as
one
of
our
of
the
previous
day
respecting
whom
jorrocks
and
i
had
had
a
dispute
as
to
whether
he
was
a
frenchman
or
a
german
his
equestrian
performances
decided
the
point
i
never
in
all
my
life
witnessed
such
an
exhibition
nor
one
in
which
the
performer
evinced
such
whether
he
had
ever
been
on
horseback
before
or
not
i
ca
tell
but
the
way
in
which
he
went
to
work
using
the
bridle
as
a
sort
of
rattle
to
frighten
the
horse
forward
the
way
in
which
he
shook
the
reins
threw
his
arms
about
and
belaboured
the
poor
devil
of
an
animal
in
order
to
get
him
into
a
canter
the
horse
of
course
turning
away
every
time
he
saw
the
blow
coming
and
the
free
unrestrained
liberty
he
gave
to
his
head
surpassed
everything
of
the
sort
i
ever
saw
and
considerably
endangered
the
lives
of
several
of
his
majesty
lieges
that
happened
to
be
passing
instead
of
getting
out
of
their
way
frenchmanlike
he
seemed
to
think
everything
should
give
way
to
an
equestrian
and
i
saw
him
scatter
a
party
of
ladies
like
a
covey
of
partridges
by
riding
slap
amongst
them
and
not
even
making
the
slightest
apology
or
obeisance
for
the
rudeness
there
he
kept
cantering
or
cantering
as
much
as
he
could
induce
the
poor
rip
to
do
from
one
end
of
the
town
to
the
other
conceiving
i
make
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
he
was
looked
upon
with
eyes
of
admiration
by
the
beholders
he
soon
created
no
little
sensation
and
before
he
was
done
a
crowd
had
collected
near
the
pier
hotel
to
see
him
get
his
horse
past
it
being
a
pier
hotel
nag
each
time
and
i
heard
a
primitive
sort
of
postman
who
was
delivering
the
few
letters
that
arrive
in
the
place
out
of
a
declare
that
he
would
sooner
kill
a
horse
than
lend
it
to
such
a
chap
having
fretted
his
hour
away
the
owner
claimed
the
horse
and
monsieur
was
dismounted
after
surveying
the
back
of
the
town
we
found
ourselves
rambling
in
some
beautiful
picturesque
fields
in
the
rear
kent
is
a
beautiful
county
and
the
trimly
kept
gardens
and
the
clustering
vines
twining
around
the
neatly
thatched
cottages
remind
one
of
the
rich
luxuriant
soil
and
climate
of
the
south
forgetting
that
we
were
in
search
of
sea
breezes
we
continued
to
saunter
on
across
one
field
over
one
stile
and
then
over
another
until
after
passing
by
the
side
of
a
house
with
a
beautifully
kept
garden
the
road
took
a
sudden
turn
and
brought
us
to
some
ground
in
front
at
one
side
of
which
jorrocks
saw
something
that
he
swore
was
a
kennel
i
knows
a
hawk
from
a
said
he
let
me
alone
for
that
swear
there
are
hounds
in
it
bless
your
heart
do
i
see
a
gilt
fox
on
one
end
and
a
gilt
hare
on
the
other
just
then
came
up
a
man
in
a
round
fustian
jacket
to
whom
jorrocks
addressed
himself
and
as
good
luck
would
have
it
he
turned
out
to
be
the
huntsman
for
jorrocks
was
right
about
the
kennel
and
away
we
went
to
look
at
the
hounds
they
proved
to
be
collard
the
owner
of
the
house
that
we
had
just
passed
and
were
really
a
very
nice
pack
of
harriers
consisting
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
couple
kept
in
better
style
as
far
as
kennel
appearance
goes
than
of
the
harriers
in
england
bird
the
huntsman
our
cicerone
seemed
a
regular
keen
one
in
hunting
matters
and
jorrocks
and
he
had
a
long
confab
about
the
noble
art
of
hunting
though
the
former
was
rather
mortified
to
find
on
announcing
himself
as
the
celebrated
jorrocks
that
bird
had
never
heard
of
him
before
after
leaving
the
kennel
we
struck
across
a
few
fields
and
soon
found
ourselves
on
the
sea
banks
along
which
we
proceeded
at
the
rate
of
about
two
miles
an
hour
until
we
came
to
the
old
church
of
reculvers
hard
by
is
a
the
sign
of
the
two
sisters
where
having
each
taken
a
couple
of
glasses
of
ale
we
proceeded
to
enjoy
one
of
the
to
me
at
least
greatest
luxuries
in
life
viz
that
of
lying
on
the
shingle
of
the
beach
with
my
heels
just
at
the
water
edge
the
day
was
intensely
hot
and
after
occupying
this
position
for
about
half
an
hour
and
finding
the
perpendicular
rays
of
the
sun
rather
fiercer
than
agreeable
we
followed
the
example
of
a
flock
of
sheep
and
availed
ourselves
of
the
shade
afforded
by
the
reculvers
here
for
a
short
distance
along
the
beach
on
both
sides
are
small
breakwaters
and
immediately
below
the
reculvers
is
one
formed
of
stake
and
matting
capable
of
holding
two
persons
sofa
fashion
into
this
jorrocks
and
i
crept
the
tide
being
at
that
particular
point
that
enabled
us
to
repose
with
the
water
lashing
our
cradle
on
both
sides
without
dashing
high
enough
to
wet
us
oh
but
this
is
fine
said
j
dangling
his
arm
over
the
side
and
letting
the
sea
wash
against
his
hand
i
declare
it
comes
fizzing
up
just
like
out
of
a
bottle
reminds
me
of
the
by
the
way
yorkshireman
i
heard
some
chaps
in
our
inn
this
morning
talking
about
this
werry
place
and
one
of
them
said
that
there
used
to
be
a
roman
station
or
something
of
that
sort
at
it
did
you
know
anything
of
them
ancient
romans
luxterous
dogs
i
understand
if
nimrod
was
here
now
he
could
tell
us
all
about
them
for
if
i
mistake
not
he
was
werry
intimate
with
some
of
them
either
he
or
his
father
at
least
a
boat
that
had
been
gradually
advancing
towards
us
now
run
on
shore
close
by
where
we
were
lying
and
one
of
the
crew
landed
with
a
jug
to
get
some
beer
a
large
basket
at
the
end
attracted
jorrocks
attention
and
doglike
he
got
up
and
began
to
hover
about
and
inquire
about
their
destination
of
the
remaining
crew
four
in
number
they
were
a
cockney
party
of
pleasure
it
seemed
going
to
fish
for
which
purpose
they
had
hired
the
boat
and
laid
in
no
end
of
bait
for
the
fish
and
prog
for
themselves
jorrocks
though
no
great
fisherman
not
having
as
he
says
patience
enough
is
never
at
a
loss
if
there
is
plenty
of
eating
and
finding
that
they
had
got
a
great
chicken
pie
two
tongues
and
a
tart
agreed
to
pay
for
the
boat
if
they
would
let
us
in
upon
equal
terms
with
themselves
as
to
the
provender
which
was
agreed
to
without
a
debate
the
messenger
having
returned
with
a
gallon
of
ale
we
embarked
and
away
we
slid
through
the
glad
waters
of
the
dark
blue
sea
it
was
beautifully
calm
scarcely
a
breeze
appearing
on
the
surface
after
rowing
for
about
an
hour
one
of
the
boatmen
began
to
adjust
the
lines
and
bait
the
hooks
and
having
got
into
what
he
esteemed
a
favourite
spot
he
cast
anchor
and
prepared
for
the
sport
each
man
was
prepared
with
a
long
strong
cord
line
with
a
couple
of
hooks
fastened
to
the
ends
of
about
a
foot
of
whalebone
with
a
small
leaden
plummet
in
the
centre
the
hooks
were
baited
with
sandworms
and
the
instructions
given
were
after
sounding
the
depth
to
raise
the
hooks
a
little
from
the
bottom
so
as
to
let
them
hang
conveniently
for
the
fish
to
swallow
great
was
the
excitement
as
we
dropped
the
lines
overboard
as
to
who
should
catch
the
first
whale
jorrocks
and
myself
having
taken
the
fishermen
lines
from
them
we
all
met
upon
pretty
equal
terms
much
like
gentlemen
jockeys
in
a
race
a
dead
silence
ensued
i
have
one
cried
the
youngest
of
our
new
friends
then
pull
him
up
responded
one
of
the
boatmen
gently
or
you
lose
him
and
so
i
have
by
god
he
gone
well
never
mind
said
the
boatmen
let
see
your
bait
aye
he
got
that
too
we
put
some
fresh
on
there
you
are
again
all
right
now
drop
it
gently
and
when
you
find
you
hooked
him
wind
the
line
quickly
but
quietly
and
be
sure
you
do
jerk
the
hook
out
of
his
mouth
at
starting
i
got
one
cries
jorrocks
i
got
one
now
my
wig
if
i
can
but
land
him
i
have
him
certainly
by
jove
he
a
wopper
too
judging
by
the
way
he
kicks
oh
but
it
no
use
sir
come
along
come
along
here
he
is
doublets
by
crikey
two
huzza
huzza
what
fine
ones
young
haddocks
or
codlings
i
should
call
them
werry
nice
eating
i
dare
say
i
blow
if
this
ar
sport
i
have
one
cries
our
young
friend
again
so
have
i
shouts
another
and
just
at
the
same
moment
i
felt
the
magic
touch
of
my
bait
and
in
an
instant
i
felt
the
thrilling
stroke
the
fish
were
absolutely
voracious
and
we
had
nothing
short
of
a
miraculous
draught
as
fast
as
we
could
bait
they
swallowed
and
we
frequently
pulled
them
up
two
at
a
time
jorrocks
was
in
ecstasies
it
was
the
finest
sport
he
had
ever
encountered
and
he
kept
halloaing
and
shouting
every
time
he
pulled
them
up
as
though
he
were
out
with
the
surrey
having
just
hooked
a
second
couple
he
baited
again
and
dropped
his
line
two
of
our
new
friends
had
hooked
fish
at
the
same
instant
and
in
their
eagerness
to
take
them
overbalanced
the
boat
and
jorrocks
who
was
leaning
over
went
head
foremost
down
into
the
deeps
a
terrible
surprise
came
over
us
and
for
a
second
or
two
we
were
so
perfectly
thunderstruck
as
to
be
incapable
of
rendering
any
assistance
a
great
splash
followed
by
a
slight
gurgling
sound
as
the
water
bubbled
and
subsided
the
place
where
he
went
down
was
all
that
denoted
the
exit
of
our
friend
after
a
considerable
dive
he
rose
to
the
surface
minus
his
hat
and
wig
but
speedily
disappeared
the
anchor
was
weighed
oars
put
out
and
the
boat
rowed
to
the
spot
where
he
last
appeared
he
rose
a
third
time
but
out
of
arms
reach
apparently
lifeless
and
just
as
he
was
sinking
most
probably
for
ever
one
of
the
men
contrived
to
slip
the
end
of
an
oar
under
his
arm
and
support
him
on
the
water
until
he
got
within
reach
from
the
boat
the
consternation
when
we
got
him
on
board
was
tremendous
consisting
as
we
did
of
two
parties
neither
knowing
where
the
other
had
come
from
we
remained
in
a
state
of
stupefied
horror
indecision
and
amazement
for
some
minutes
the
poor
old
man
lay
extended
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
apparently
lifeless
and
even
if
the
vital
spark
had
not
fled
there
seemed
no
chance
of
reaching
herne
bay
whose
pier
just
then
gilded
by
the
rich
golden
rays
of
the
setting
sun
appeared
in
the
far
distance
of
the
horizon
where
to
row
to
was
the
question
no
habitation
where
effective
succour
could
be
procured
appeared
on
the
shore
and
to
proceed
without
a
certain
destination
was
fruitless
how
helpless
such
a
period
as
this
makes
a
man
feel
let
make
for
grace
at
length
exclaimed
one
of
the
boatmen
and
the
other
catching
at
the
proposition
the
head
of
the
boat
was
whipped
round
in
an
instant
and
away
we
sped
through
the
water
not
a
word
broke
upon
the
sound
of
the
splashing
oars
until
nearing
the
shore
one
of
the
men
looking
round
directed
us
to
steer
a
little
to
the
right
in
the
direction
of
a
sort
of
dell
or
peculiar
to
the
isle
of
thanet
and
presently
we
ran
the
head
of
the
boat
upon
the
shingle
just
where
a
small
rivulet
that
descending
from
the
higher
grounds
waters
the
thickly
wooded
ravine
and
discharges
itself
into
the
sea
the
entrance
of
this
dell
is
formed
by
a
lofty
precipitous
rock
with
a
few
stunted
overhanging
trees
on
one
side
while
the
other
is
more
open
and
softened
in
its
aspect
and
though
steep
and
narrow
at
the
mouth
gently
slopes
away
into
a
bank
which
stretching
up
the
little
valley
becomes
lost
in
a
forest
of
lofty
oaks
that
close
the
inland
prospect
of
the
place
here
to
the
left
just
after
one
gets
clear
of
the
steeper
part
commanding
a
view
of
the
sea
and
yet
almost
concealed
from
the
eye
of
a
careless
traveller
was
a
lonely
hut
the
back
wall
formed
by
an
excavation
of
the
sandy
rock
and
the
rest
of
clay
supporting
a
wooden
roof
made
of
the
hull
of
a
castaway
wreck
the
abode
of
an
old
woman
called
grace
ganderne
well
known
throughout
the
whole
isle
of
thanet
as
a
poor
harmless
secluded
widow
who
subsisted
partly
on
the
charity
of
her
neighbours
and
partly
on
what
she
could
glean
from
the
smugglers
for
the
assistance
she
affords
them
in
running
their
goods
on
that
coast
and
though
she
had
been
at
work
for
forty
years
she
had
never
had
the
misfortune
to
be
detected
in
the
act
notwithstanding
the
many
puncheons
of
spirits
and
many
bales
of
goods
fished
out
of
the
dark
woods
near
her
domicile
to
this
spot
it
was
just
as
the
setting
sun
pathetic
light
had
been
succeeded
by
the
grey
twilight
of
the
evening
that
we
bore
the
body
of
our
unfortunate
companion
the
door
was
closed
but
grace
being
accustomed
to
nocturnal
visitors
speedily
answered
the
first
summons
and
presented
herself
she
was
evidently
of
immense
age
being
nearly
bowed
double
and
her
figure
with
her
silvery
hair
confined
by
a
blue
checked
cotton
handkerchief
and
palsied
hand
as
tremblingly
she
rested
upon
her
staff
and
eyed
the
group
would
have
made
a
subject
worthy
of
the
pencil
of
a
landseer
she
was
wrapped
in
an
old
red
cloak
with
a
large
hood
and
in
her
ears
she
wore
a
pair
of
long
earrings
similar
to
what
one
sees
among
the
norman
peasantry
the
gift
as
i
afterwards
learned
of
a
drowned
lover
after
scrutinising
us
for
a
second
or
two
during
which
time
a
large
black
cat
kept
walking
to
and
fro
purring
and
rubbing
itself
against
her
she
held
back
the
door
and
beckoned
us
to
enter
the
little
place
was
cleanly
swept
up
and
a
faggot
and
some
dry
brushwood
which
she
had
just
lighted
for
the
purpose
of
boiling
her
kettle
threw
a
gleam
of
light
over
the
apartment
alike
her
bedchamber
parlour
and
kitchen
her
curtainless
bed
at
the
side
covered
with
a
coarse
brown
counterpane
was
speedily
prepared
for
our
friend
into
which
being
laid
our
new
acquaintances
were
dispatched
in
search
of
doctors
while
the
boatman
and
myself
under
the
direction
of
old
grace
applied
ourselves
to
procuring
such
restoratives
as
her
humble
dwelling
afforded
let
grace
alone
said
the
younger
of
the
boatmen
seeing
my
affliction
at
the
lamentable
catastrophe
if
there
be
but
a
spark
of
life
in
the
gentleman
she
bring
him
round
many
the
drowning
man
aye
and
wounded
one
too
that
been
brought
in
here
during
the
stormy
nights
and
after
fights
with
the
that
she
recovered
hot
bottles
and
hot
flannels
and
hot
bricks
were
all
applied
but
in
vain
and
when
i
saw
hot
brandy
too
fail
of
having
the
desired
effect
i
gave
my
friend
up
as
lost
and
left
the
hut
to
vent
my
grief
in
the
open
air
grace
was
more
sanguine
and
persevering
and
when
i
returned
after
a
absence
i
could
distinctly
feel
a
returning
pulse
still
he
gave
no
symptoms
of
animation
and
it
might
only
be
the
effect
produced
by
the
applications
as
he
remained
in
the
same
state
for
several
hours
fresh
wood
was
added
to
the
fire
and
the
boatmen
having
returned
to
their
vessel
grace
and
i
proceeded
to
keep
watch
during
the
night
or
until
the
arrival
of
a
doctor
the
poor
old
body
to
whom
scenes
such
as
this
were
matter
of
frequent
occurrence
seemed
to
think
nothing
of
it
and
proceeded
to
relate
some
of
the
wonderful
escapes
and
recoveries
she
had
witnessed
in
the
course
of
which
she
dropped
many
a
sigh
to
the
memory
of
some
of
her
friends
the
bold
smugglers
there
were
no
such
braw
lads
now
as
formerly
she
said
and
were
it
not
that
she
was
past
eighty
and
might
as
weel
die
in
one
place
as
anither
she
wad
gang
back
to
the
bonny
blue
hulls
hills
of
her
ain
canny
scotland
in
the
middle
of
one
of
her
long
stories
i
thought
i
perceived
a
movement
of
the
bedclothes
and
going
to
look
i
found
a
considerable
increase
in
the
quickness
of
pulsation
and
also
a
generous
sort
of
glow
upon
the
skin
an
ded
i
no
tell
ye
i
wad
recover
him
said
she
with
a
triumphant
look
afore
twa
mair
hours
are
he
spak
to
ye
i
hope
so
i
sure
said
i
still
almost
doubting
her
oh
trust
to
me
said
she
he
come
about
i
seen
mony
a
chiel
in
a
mickle
worse
state
nor
him
recovered
pray
is
the
ould
gintleman
your
father
or
your
grandfather
why
i
ca
say
that
he
either
exactly
but
always
been
as
good
as
a
grandmother
to
me
i
know
grace
was
right
about
three
in
the
morning
a
sort
of
revulsion
of
nature
took
place
and
after
having
lain
insensible
and
to
all
appearance
lifeless
all
that
time
he
suddenly
began
to
move
casting
his
eye
wildly
around
he
seemed
lost
in
amazement
he
muttered
something
but
what
it
was
i
could
not
catch
again
by
jove
were
the
first
words
he
articulated
and
then
appearing
to
recollect
himself
he
added
oh
i
forgot
drowned
well
drowned
too
ca
be
help
however
was
born
to
be
hanged
and
that
seems
clear
thus
he
kept
muttering
and
mumbling
for
an
hour
until
old
grace
thinking
him
so
far
recovered
as
to
remove
all
danger
from
sudden
surprise
allowed
me
to
take
her
seat
at
the
bedside
he
looked
at
me
long
and
intensely
but
the
light
was
not
sufficiently
strong
to
enable
him
to
make
out
who
i
was
jorrocks
at
length
said
i
taking
him
by
the
hand
how

at
the
sound
of
his
name
