preface
a
word
about
the
origin
and
authorship
of
this
book
in
october
last
my
friend
visited
me
in
my
chambers
and
under
a
provisional
pledge
of
secrecy
told
me
frankly
the
whole
of
the
adventure
described
in
these
pages
till
then
i
had
only
known
as
much
as
the
rest
of
his
friends
namely
that
he
had
recently
undergone
experiences
during
a
yachting
cruise
with
a
certain
mr
which
had
left
a
deep
mark
on
his
character
and
habits
at
the
end
of
his
narrative
which
from
its
bearing
on
studies
and
speculations
of
my
own
as
well
as
from
its
intrinsic
interest
and
racy
delivery
made
a
very
deep
impression
on
me
he
added
that
the
important
facts
discovered
in
the
course
of
the
cruise
had
without
a
moment
delay
been
communicated
to
the
proper
authorities
who
after
some
dignified
incredulity
due
in
part
perhaps
to
the
pitiful
inadequacy
of
their
own
secret
service
had
he
believed
made
use
of
them
to
avert
a
great
national
danger
i
say
believed
for
though
it
was
beyond
question
that
the
danger
was
averted
for
the
time
it
was
doubtful
whether
they
had
stirred
a
foot
to
combat
it
the
secret
discovered
being
of
such
a
nature
that
mere
suspicion
of
it
on
this
side
was
likely
to
destroy
its
efficacy
there
however
that
may
be
the
matter
rested
for
a
while
as
for
personal
reasons
which
will
be
manifest
to
the
reader
he
and
mr
expressly
wished
it
to
rest
but
events
were
driving
them
to
reconsider
their
decision
these
seemed
to
show
that
the
information
wrung
with
such
peril
and
labour
from
the
german
government
and
transmitted
so
promptly
to
our
own
had
had
none
but
the
most
transitory
influence
on
our
policy
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
national
security
was
really
being
neglected
the
two
friends
now
had
a
mind
to
make
their
story
public
and
it
was
about
this
that
wished
for
my
advice
the
great
drawback
was
that
an
englishman
bearing
an
honoured
name
was
disgracefully
implicated
and
that
unless
infinite
delicacy
were
used
innocent
persons
and
especially
a
young
lady
would
suffer
pain
and
indignity
if
his
identity
were
known
indeed
troublesome
rumours
containing
a
grain
of
truth
and
a
mass
of
falsehood
were
already
afloat
after
weighing
both
sides
of
the
question
i
gave
my
vote
emphatically
for
publication
the
personal
drawbacks
could
i
thought
with
tact
be
neutralized
while
from
the
public
point
of
view
nothing
but
good
could
come
from
submitting
the
case
to
the
common
sense
of
the
country
at
large
publication
therefore
was
agreed
upon
and
the
next
point
was
the
form
it
should
take
with
the
concurrence
of
mr
was
for
a
bald
exposition
of
the
essential
facts
stripped
of
their
warm
human
envelope
i
was
strongly
against
this
course
first
because
it
would
aggravate
instead
of
allaying
the
rumours
that
were
current
secondly
because
in
such
a
form
the
narrative
would
not
carry
conviction
and
would
thus
defeat
its
own
end
the
persons
and
the
events
were
indissolubly
connected
to
evade
abridge
suppress
would
be
to
convey
to
the
reader
the
idea
of
a
concocted
hoax
indeed
i
took
bolder
ground
still
urging
that
the
story
should
be
made
as
explicit
and
circumstantial
as
possible
frankly
and
honestly
for
the
purpose
of
entertaining
and
so
of
attracting
a
wide
circle
of
readers
even
anonymity
was
undesirable
nevertheless
certain
precautions
were
imperatively
needed
to
cut
the
matter
short
they
asked
for
my
assistance
and
received
it
at
once
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
edit
the
book
that
should
give
me
his
diary
and
recount
to
me
in
fuller
detail
and
from
his
own
point
of
view
all
the
phases
of
the
as
they
used
to
call
it
that
mr
should
meet
me
with
his
charts
and
maps
and
do
the
same
and
that
the
whole
story
should
be
written
as
from
the
mouth
of
the
former
with
its
humours
and
errors
its
light
and
its
dark
side
just
as
it
happened
with
the
following
few
limitations
the
year
it
belongs
to
is
disguised
the
names
of
persons
are
throughout
fictitious
and
at
my
instance
certain
slight
liberties
have
been
taken
to
conceal
the
identity
of
the
english
characters
remember
also
that
these
persons
are
living
now
in
the
midst
of
us
and
if
you
find
one
topic
touched
on
with
a
light
and
hesitating
pen
do
not
blame
the
editor
who
whether
they
are
known
or
not
would
rather
say
too
little
than
say
a
word
that
might
savour
of
impertinence
march
note
the
maps
and
charts
are
based
on
british
and
german
admiralty
charts
with
irrelevant
details
omitted
i
the
letter
i
have
read
of
men
who
when
forced
by
their
calling
to
live
for
long
periods
in
utter
solitude
save
for
a
few
black
faces
have
made
it
a
rule
to
dress
regularly
for
dinner
in
order
to
maintain
their
and
prevent
a
relapse
into
barbarism
it
was
in
some
such
spirit
with
an
added
touch
of
that
at
seven
in
the
evening
of
september
in
a
recent
year
i
was
making
my
evening
toilet
in
my
chambers
in
pall
mall
i
thought
the
date
and
the
place
justified
the
parallel
to
my
advantage
even
for
the
obscure
burmese
administrator
might
well
be
a
man
of
blunted
sensibilities
and
coarse
fibre
and
at
least
he
is
alone
with
nature
while
i
well
a
young
man
of
condition
and
fashion
who
knows
the
right
people
belongs
to
the
right
clubs
has
a
safe
possibly
a
brilliant
future
in
the
foreign
office
may
be
excused
for
a
sense
of
complacent
martyrdom
when
with
his
keen
appreciation
of
the
social
calendar
he
is
doomed
to
the
outer
solitude
of
london
in
september
i
say
but
in
fact
the
case
was
infinitely
worse
for
to
feel
oneself
a
martyr
as
everybody
knows
is
a
pleasurable
thing
and
the
true
tragedy
of
my
position
was
that
i
had
passed
that
stage
i
had
enjoyed
what
sweets
it
had
to
offer
in
ever
dwindling
degree
since
the
middle
of
august
when
ties
were
still
fresh
and
sympathy
abundant
i
had
been
conscious
that
i
was
missed
at
morven
lodge
party
lady
ashleigh
herself
had
said
so
in
the
kindest
possible
manner
when
she
wrote
to
acknowledge
the
letter
in
which
i
explained
with
an
effectively
austere
reserve
of
language
that
circumstances
compelled
me
to
remain
at
my
office
know
how
busy
you
must
be
just
now
she
wrote
i
do
hope
you
overwork
we
shall
miss
you
very
much
friend
after
friend
away
to
sport
and
fresh
air
with
promises
to
write
and
chaffing
condolences
and
as
each
deserted
the
sinking
ship
i
took
a
grim
delight
in
my
misery
positively
almost
enjoying
the
first
week
or
two
after
my
world
had
been
finally
dissipated
to
the
four
bracing
winds
of
heaven
i
began
to
take
a
spurious
interest
in
the
remaining
five
millions
and
wrote
several
clever
letters
in
a
vein
of
cheap
satire
indirectly
suggesting
the
pathos
of
my
position
but
indicating
that
i
was
enough
to
find
intellectual
entertainment
in
the
scenes
persons
and
habits
of
london
in
the
dead
season
i
even
did
rational
things
at
the
instigation
of
others
for
though
i
should
have
liked
total
isolation
best
i
of
course
found
that
there
was
a
sediment
of
unfortunates
like
myself
who
unlike
me
viewed
the
situation
in
a
most
prosaic
light
there
were
river
excursions
and
so
on
after
but
i
dislike
the
river
at
any
time
for
its
noisy
vulgarity
and
most
of
all
at
this
season
so
i
dropped
out
of
the
fresh
air
brigade
and
declined
h
offer
to
share
a
riverside
cottage
and
run
up
to
town
in
the
mornings
i
did
spend
one
or
two
ends
with
the
catesbys
in
kent
but
i
was
not
inconsolable
when
they
let
their
house
and
went
abroad
for
i
found
that
such
partial
compensations
did
not
suit
me
neither
did
the
taste
for
satirical
observation
last
a
passing
thirst
which
i
dare
say
many
have
shared
for
adventures
of
the
fascinating
kind
described
in
the
arabian
led
me
on
a
few
evenings
into
some
shady
haunts
in
soho
and
farther
eastward
but
was
finally
quenched
one
sultry
saturday
night
after
an
hour
immersion
in
the
reeking
atmosphere
of
a
low
in
ratcliffe
highway
where
i
sat
next
a
portly
female
who
suffered
from
the
heat
and
at
frequent
intervals
refreshed
herself
and
an
infant
from
a
bottle
of
tepid
stout
by
the
first
week
in
september
i
had
abandoned
all
palliatives
and
had
settled
into
the
dismal
but
dignified
routine
of
office
club
and
chambers
and
now
came
the
most
cruel
trial
for
the
hideous
truth
dawned
on
me
that
the
world
i
found
so
indispensable
could
after
all
dispense
with
me
it
was
all
very
well
for
lady
ashleigh
to
assure
me
that
i
was
deeply
missed
but
a
letter
from
f
who
was
one
of
the
party
written
haste
just
starting
to
shoot
and
coming
as
a
tardy
reply
to
one
of
my
cleverest
made
me
aware
that
the
house
party
had
suffered
little
from
my
absence
and
that
few
sighs
were
wasted
on
me
even
in
the
quarter
which
i
had
assumed
to
have
been
discreetly
alluded
to
by
the
underlined
in
lady
ashleigh
shall
miss
you
a
thrust
which
smarted
more
if
it
bit
less
deeply
came
from
my
cousin
nesta
who
wrote
horrid
for
you
to
have
to
be
baking
in
london
now
but
after
all
it
must
be
a
great
pleasure
to
you
malicious
little
wretch
have
such
interesting
and
important
work
to
do
here
was
a
nemesis
for
an
innocent
illusion
i
had
been
accustomed
to
foster
in
the
minds
of
my
relations
and
acquaintances
especially
in
the
breasts
of
the
trustful
and
admiring
maidens
whom
i
had
taken
down
to
dinner
in
the
last
two
seasons
a
fiction
which
i
had
almost
reached
the
point
of
believing
in
myself
for
the
plain
truth
was
that
my
work
was
neither
interesting
nor
important
and
consisted
chiefly
at
present
in
smoking
cigarettes
in
saying
that
mr
was
away
and
would
be
back
about
october
in
being
absent
for
lunch
from
twelve
till
two
and
in
my
spare
moments
making
of
let
us
say
the
less
confidential
consular
reports
and
squeezing
the
results
into
schedules
the
reason
of
my
detention
was
not
a
cloud
on
the
international
horizon
though
i
may
say
in
passing
that
there
was
such
a
cloud
but
a
caprice
on
the
part
of
a
remote
and
mighty
personage
the
effect
of
which
ramifying
downwards
had
dislocated
the
holiday
plans
of
the
humble
juniors
and
in
my
own
small
case
had
upset
the
arrangement
between
myself
and
k
who
positively
liked
the
in
whitehall
only
one
thing
was
needed
to
fill
my
cup
of
bitterness
and
this
it
was
that
specially
occupied
me
as
i
dressed
for
dinner
this
evening
two
days
more
in
this
dead
and
fermenting
city
and
my
slavery
would
be
at
an
end
yes
but
irony
of
ironies
i
had
nowhere
to
go
to
the
morven
lodge
party
was
breaking
up
a
dreadful
rumour
as
to
an
engagement
which
had
been
one
of
its
accursed
fruits
tormented
me
with
the
fresh
certainty
that
i
had
not
been
missed
and
bred
in
me
that
most
desolating
brand
of
cynicism
which
is
produced
by
defeat
through
insignificance
invitations
for
a
later
date
which
i
had
declined
in
july
with
a
gratifying
sense
of
being
much
in
request
now
rose
up
spectrally
to
taunt
me
there
was
at
least
one
which
i
could
easily
have
revived
but
neither
in
this
case
nor
in
any
other
had
there
been
any
renewal
of
pressure
and
there
are
moments
when
the
difference
between
proposing
oneself
and
surrendering
as
a
prize
to
one
of
several
eagerly
competing
hostesses
seems
too
crushing
to
be
contemplated
my
own
people
were
at
aix
for
my
father
gout
to
join
them
was
a
whose
banality
was
repellent
besides
they
would
be
leaving
soon
for
our
home
in
yorkshire
and
i
was
not
a
prophet
in
my
own
country
in
short
i
was
at
the
extremity
of
depression
the
usual
preliminary
scuffle
on
the
staircase
prepared
me
for
the
knock
and
entry
of
withers
one
of
the
things
which
had
for
some
time
ceased
to
amuse
me
was
the
laxity
of
manners
proper
to
the
season
among
the
servants
of
the
big
block
of
chambers
where
i
lived
withers
demurely
handed
me
a
letter
bearing
a
german
postmark
and
marked
i
had
just
finished
dressing
and
was
collecting
my
money
and
gloves
a
momentary
thrill
of
curiosity
broke
in
upon
my
depression
as
i
sat
down
to
open
it
a
corner
on
the
reverse
of
the
envelope
bore
the
blotted
legend
sorry
but
there
one
other
thing
a
pair
of
rigging
screws
from
carey
and
neilson
size
here
it
is
yacht
flensburg
i
daresay
you
be
surprised
at
hearing
from
me
as
it
ages
since
we
met
it
is
more
than
likely
too
that
what
going
to
suggest
wo
suit
you
for
i
know
nothing
of
your
plans
and
if
you
in
town
at
all
you
probably
just
getting
into
harness
again
and
ca
get
away
so
i
merely
write
on
the
offchance
to
ask
if
you
would
care
to
come
out
here
and
join
me
in
a
little
yachting
and
i
hope
duck
shooting
i
know
you
keen
on
shooting
and
i
sort
of
remember
that
you
have
done
some
yachting
too
though
i
rather
forget
about
that
this
part
of
the
baltic
the
schleswig
fiords
is
a
splendid
a
scenery
and
there
ought
to
be
plenty
of
duck
about
soon
if
it
gets
cold
enough
i
came
out
here
holland
and
the
frisian
islands
starting
early
in
august
my
pals
have
had
to
leave
me
and
i
badly
in
want
of
another
as
i
do
want
to
lay
up
yet
for
a
bit
i
need
say
how
glad
i
should
be
if
you
could
come
if
you
can
send
me
a
wire
to
the
here
flushing
and
on
by
hamburg
will
be
your
best
route
i
think
having
a
few
repairs
done
here
and
will
have
them
ready
sharp
by
the
time
your
train
arrives
bring
your
gun
and
a
good
lot
of
no
and
would
you
mind
calling
at
lancaster
and
asking
for
mine
and
bringing
it
too
bring
some
oilskins
better
get
the
sort
jacket
and
trousers
not
the
brand
and
if
you
paint
bring
your
gear
i
know
you
speak
german
like
a
native
and
that
will
be
a
great
help
forgive
this
hail
of
directions
but
i
a
sort
of
feeling
that
i
in
luck
and
that
you
come
anyway
i
hope
you
and
the
both
flourish
yours
ever
would
you
mind
bringing
me
out
a
and
a
pound
of
raven
mixture
this
letter
marked
an
epoch
for
me
but
i
little
suspected
the
fact
as
i
crumpled
it
into
my
pocket
and
started
languidly
on
the
which
i
nightly
followed
to
the
club
in
pall
mall
there
were
no
dignified
greetings
to
be
exchanged
now
with
acquaintances
the
only
people
to
be
seen
were
some
late
stragglers
from
the
park
with
a
perambulator
and
some
hot
and
dusty
children
lagging
fretfully
behind
some
rustic
sightseers
draining
the
last
dregs
of
the
daylight
in
an
effort
to
make
out
from
their
which
of
these
reverend
piles
was
which
a
policeman
and
a
cart
of
course
the
club
was
a
strange
one
both
of
my
own
being
closed
for
cleaning
a
coincidence
expressly
planned
by
providence
for
my
inconvenience
the
club
which
you
are
to
make
use
of
on
these
occasions
always
irritates
with
its
strangeness
and
discomfort
the
few
occupants
seem
odd
and
oddly
dressed
and
you
wonder
how
they
got
there
the
particular
weekly
that
you
want
is
not
taken
in
the
dinner
is
execrable
and
the
ventilation
a
farce
all
these
evils
oppressed
me
and
yet
i
was
puzzled
to
find
that
somewhere
within
me
there
was
a
faint
lightening
of
the
spirits
causeless
as
far
as
i
could
discover
it
could
not
be
letter
yachting
in
the
baltic
at
the
end
of
september
the
very
idea
made
one
shudder
cowes
with
a
pleasant
party
and
hotels
handy
was
all
very
well
an
august
cruise
on
a
steam
yacht
in
french
waters
or
the
highlands
was
all
very
well
but
what
kind
of
a
yacht
was
this
it
must
be
of
a
certain
size
to
have
got
so
far
but
i
thought
i
remembered
enough
of
davies
means
to
know
that
he
had
no
money
to
waste
on
luxuries
that
brought
me
to
the
man
himself
i
had
known
him
at
oxford
not
as
one
of
my
immediate
set
but
we
were
a
sociable
college
and
i
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
him
liking
him
for
his
physical
energy
combined
with
a
certain
simplicity
and
modesty
though
indeed
he
had
nothing
to
be
conceited
about
liked
him
in
fact
in
the
way
that
at
that
receptive
period
one
likes
many
men
whom
one
never
keeps
up
with
later
we
had
both
gone
down
in
the
same
year
three
years
ago
now
i
had
gone
to
france
and
germany
for
two
years
to
learn
the
languages
he
had
failed
for
the
indian
civil
and
then
had
gone
into
a
solicitor
office
i
had
only
seen
him
since
at
rare
intervals
though
i
admitted
to
myself
that
for
his
part
he
had
clung
loyally
to
what
ties
of
friendship
there
were
between
us
but
the
truth
was
that
we
had
drifted
apart
from
the
nature
of
things
i
had
passed
brilliantly
into
my
profession
and
on
the
few
occasions
i
had
met
him
since
i
made
my
triumphant
in
society
i
had
found
nothing
left
in
common
between
us
he
seemed
to
know
none
of
my
friends
he
dressed
indifferently
and
i
thought
him
dull
i
had
always
connected
him
with
boats
and
the
sea
but
never
with
yachting
in
the
sense
that
i
understood
it
in
college
days
he
had
nearly
persuaded
me
into
sharing
a
squalid
week
in
some
open
boat
he
had
picked
up
and
was
going
to
sail
among
some
dreary
mudflats
somewhere
on
the
east
coast
there
was
nothing
else
and
the
funereal
function
of
dinner
drifted
on
but
i
found
myself
remembering
at
the
that
i
had
recently
heard
at
second
or
third
hand
of
something
else
about
him
exactly
what
i
could
not
recall
when
i
reached
the
savoury
i
had
concluded
so
far
as
i
had
centred
my
mind
on
it
at
all
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
culminating
irony
as
indeed
was
the
savoury
in
its
way
after
the
wreck
of
my
pleasant
plans
and
the
fiasco
of
my
martyrdom
to
be
asked
as
consolation
to
spend
october
freezing
in
the
baltic
with
an
eccentric
nonentity
who
bored
me
yet
as
i
smoked
my
cigar
in
the
ghastly
splendour
of
the
empty
the
subject
came
up
again
was
there
anything
in
it
there
were
certainly
no
alternatives
at
hand
and
to
bury
myself
in
the
baltic
at
this
unearthly
time
of
year
had
at
least
a
smack
of
tragic
thoroughness
about
it
i
pulled
out
the
letter
again
and
ran
down
its
impulsive
staccato
sentences
affecting
to
ignore
what
a
gust
of
fresh
air
high
spirits
and
good
fellowship
this
flimsy
bit
of
paper
wafted
into
the
jaded
on
reperusal
it
was
full
of
evil
presage
scenery
but
what
of
equinoctial
storms
and
october
fogs
every
sane
yachtsman
was
paying
off
his
crew
now
ought
to
be
duck
vague
very
vague
it
gets
cold
enough
cold
and
yachting
seemed
to
be
a
gratuitously
monstrous
union
his
pals
had
left
him
why
the
yachting
brand
and
why
not
as
to
the
size
comfort
and
crew
of
the
yacht
all
cheerfully
ignored
so
many
maddening
blanks
and
by
the
way
why
in
heaven
name
prismatic
compass
i
fingered
a
few
magazines
played
a
game
of
fifty
with
a
friendly
old
fogey
too
importunate
to
be
worth
the
labour
of
resisting
and
went
back
to
my
chambers
to
bed
ignorant
that
a
friendly
providence
had
come
to
my
rescue
and
indeed
rather
resenting
any
clumsy
attempt
at
such
friendliness
ii
the
that
two
days
later
i
should
be
found
pacing
the
deck
of
the
flushing
steamer
with
a
ticket
for
hamburg
in
my
pocket
may
seem
a
strange
result
yet
not
so
strange
if
you
have
divined
my
state
of
mind
you
will
guess
at
any
rate
that
i
was
armed
with
the
conviction
that
i
was
doing
an
act
of
obscure
penance
rumours
of
which
might
call
attention
to
my
lot
and
perhaps
awaken
remorse
in
the
right
quarter
while
it
left
me
free
to
enjoy
myself
unobtrusively
in
the
remote
event
of
enjoyment
being
possible
the
fact
was
that
at
breakfast
on
the
morning
after
the
arrival
of
the
letter
i
had
still
found
that
inexplicable
lightening
which
i
mentioned
before
and
strong
enough
to
warrant
a
revival
of
the
pros
and
cons
an
important
pro
which
i
had
not
thought
of
before
was
that
after
all
it
was
a
piece
of
unselfishness
to
join
davies
for
he
had
spoken
of
the
want
of
a
pal
and
seemed
honestly
to
be
in
need
of
me
i
almost
clutched
at
this
consideration
it
was
an
admirable
excuse
when
i
reached
my
office
that
day
for
a
resigned
study
of
the
continental
bradshaw
and
an
order
to
carter
to
unroll
a
great
creaking
of
germany
and
find
me
flensburg
the
latter
labour
i
might
have
saved
him
but
it
was
good
for
carter
to
have
something
to
do
and
his
patient
ignorance
was
amusing
with
most
of
the
map
and
what
it
suggested
i
was
tolerably
familiar
for
i
had
not
wasted
my
year
in
germany
whatever
i
had
done
or
not
done
since
its
people
history
progress
and
future
had
interested
me
intensely
and
i
had
still
friends
in
dresden
and
berlin
flensburg
recalled
the
danish
war
of
and
by
the
time
carter
researches
had
ended
in
success
i
had
forgotten
the
task
set
him
and
was
wondering
whether
the
prospect
of
seeing
something
of
that
lovely
region
of
see
map
a
as
i
knew
from
hearsay
that
it
was
was
at
all
to
be
set
against
such
an
uncomfortable
way
of
seeing
it
with
the
season
so
late
the
company
so
unattractive
and
all
the
other
drawbacks
which
i
counted
and
treasured
as
proofs
of
my
desperate
condition
if
i
to
go
it
needed
little
to
decide
me
and
i
think
k
arrival
from
switzerland
offensively
sunburnt
was
the
finishing
touch
his
greeting
was
carruthers
you
here
thought
you
had
got
away
long
ago
lucky
devil
though
to
be
going
now
just
in
time
for
the
best
driving
and
the
early
pheasants
the
heat
been
shocking
out
there
carter
bring
me
a
bradshaw
an
extraordinary
book
bradshaw
turned
to
from
habit
even
when
least
wanted
as
men
fondle
guns
and
rods
in
the
close
season
by
the
weight
of
indecision
had
been
removed
and
i
found
myself
entrusting
carter
with
a
telegram
to
davies
flensburg
expect
me
which
produced
three
hours
later
a
reply
please
bring
a
no
rippingille
stove
a
perplexing
and
ominous
direction
which
somehow
chilled
me
in
spite
of
its
subject
matter
indeed
my
resolution
was
continually
faltering
it
faltered
when
i
turned
out
my
gun
in
the
evening
and
thought
of
the
grouse
it
ought
to
have
accounted
for
it
faltered
again
when
i
contemplated
the
miscellaneous
list
of
commissions
sown
broadcast
through
letter
to
fulfil
which
seemed
to
make
me
a
willing
tool
where
my
chosen
was
that
of
an
embittered
exile
or
at
least
a
condescending
ally
however
i
faced
the
commissions
manfully
after
leaving
the
office
at
lancaster
i
inquired
for
his
gun
was
received
coolly
and
had
to
pay
a
heavy
bill
which
it
seemed
to
have
incurred
before
it
was
handed
over
having
ordered
the
gun
and
no
to
be
sent
to
my
chambers
i
bought
the
raven
mixture
with
that
peculiar
sense
of
injury
which
the
prospect
of
smuggling
in
another
behalf
always
entails
and
wondered
where
in
the
world
carey
and
neilson
was
a
firm
which
davies
spoke
of
as
though
it
were
as
well
known
as
the
bank
of
england
or
the
stores
instead
of
specializing
in
whatever
they
might
be
they
sounded
important
though
and
it
would
be
only
polite
to
unearth
them
i
connected
them
with
the
repairs
and
awoke
new
misgivings
at
the
stores
i
asked
for
a
no
rippingille
stove
and
was
confronted
with
a
formidable
and
hideous
piece
of
ironmongery
which
burned
petroleum
in
two
capacious
tanks
horribly
prophetic
of
a
smell
of
warm
oil
i
paid
for
this
miserably
convinced
of
its
grim
efficiency
but
speculating
as
to
the
domestic
conditions
which
caused
it
to
be
sent
for
as
an
afterthought
by
telegram
i
also
asked
about
in
the
yachting
department
but
learnt
that
they
were
not
kept
in
stock
that
carey
and
neilson
would
certainly
have
them
and
that
their
shop
was
in
the
minories
in
the
far
east
meaning
a
journey
nearly
as
long
as
to
flensburg
and
twice
as
tiresome
they
would
be
shut
by
the
time
i
got
there
so
after
this
exhausting
round
of
duty
i
went
home
in
a
cab
omitted
dressing
for
dinner
an
epoch
in
itself
ordered
a
chop
up
from
the
basement
kitchen
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
packing
and
writing
with
the
methodical
gloom
of
a
man
setting
his
affairs
in
order
for
the
last
time
the
last
of
those
airless
nights
passed
the
astonished
withers
saw
me
breakfasting
at
eight
and
at
i
was
vacantly
examining
with
what
wits
were
left
me
after
a
sulphurous
ride
in
the
underground
to
aldgate
i
laid
great
stress
on
the
and
the
galvanism
and
took
them
on
trust
ignorant
as
to
their
functions
for
the
oilskins
i
was
referred
to
a
villainous
den
in
a
back
street
which
the
shopman
said
they
always
recommended
and
where
a
dirty
and
bejewelled
hebrew
chaffered
with
me
beginning
at
over
two
reeking
orange
slabs
distantly
resembling
moieties
of
the
human
figure
their
odour
made
me
close
prematurely
for
and
i
hurried
back
for
i
was
due
there
at
to
my
office
with
my
two
disreputable
parcels
one
of
which
made
itself
so
noticeable
in
the
close
official
air
that
carter
attentively
asked
if
i
would
like
to
have
it
sent
to
my
chambers
and
k
was
inquisitive
to
bluntness
about
it
and
my
movements
but
i
did
not
care
to
enlighten
k
whose
comments
i
knew
would
be
provokingly
envious
or
wounding
to
my
pride
in
some
way
i
remembered
later
on
the
prismatic
compass
and
wired
to
the
minories
to
have
one
sent
at
once
feeling
rather
relieved
that
i
was
not
present
there
to
be
as
to
size
and
make
the
reply
was
stocked
try
maker
a
reply
both
puzzling
and
reassuring
for
davies
request
for
a
compass
had
given
me
more
uneasiness
than
anything
while
to
find
that
what
he
wanted
turned
out
to
be
a
was
a
no
less
perplexing
discovery
that
day
i
made
my
last
and
handed
over
my
schedules
procrustean
beds
where
unwilling
facts
were
stretched
and
tortured
and
said
to
my
temporary
chief
genial
and
lenient
m
who
wished
me
a
jolly
holiday
with
all
sincerity
at
seven
i
was
watching
a
cab
packed
with
my
personal
luggage
and
the
collection
of
unwieldy
and
incongruous
packages
that
my
shopping
had
drawn
down
on
me
two
deviations
after
that
wretched
prismatic
compass
which
i
obtained
in
the
end
secondhand
de
near
victoria
at
one
of
those
showy
shops
which
look
like
and
are
really
pawnbrokers
nearly
caused
me
to
miss
my
train
but
at
i
had
shaken
off
the
dust
of
london
from
my
feet
and
at
i
was
as
i
have
announced
pacing
the
deck
of
a
flushing
steamer
adrift
on
this
fatuous
holiday
in
the
far
baltic
an
air
from
the
west
cooled
by
a
midday
thunderstorm
followed
the
steamer
as
she
slid
through
the
calm
channels
of
the
thames
estuary
passed
the
cordon
of
scintillating
lightships
that
watch
over
the
to
the
imperial
city
like
pickets
round
a
sleeping
army
and
slipped
out
into
the
dark
spaces
of
the
north
sea
stars
were
bright
summer
scents
from
the
kent
cliffs
mingled
coyly
with
vulgar
the
summer
weather
held
immutably
nature
for
her
part
seemed
resolved
to
be
no
party
to
my
penance
but
to
be
imperturbably
bent
on
shedding
mild
ridicule
over
my
wrongs
an
irresistible
sense
of
peace
and
detachment
combined
with
that
delicious
physical
awakening
that
pulses
through
the
townsman
when
city
airs
and
bald
routine
are
left
behind
him
combined
to
provide
me
however
thankless
a
subject
with
a
solid
background
of
resignation
stowing
this
safely
away
i
could
calculate
my
intentions
with
cold
egotism
if
the
weather
held
i
might
pass
a
not
intolerable
fortnight
with
davies
when
it
broke
up
as
it
was
sure
to
i
could
easily
excuse
myself
from
the
pursuit
of
the
problematical
ducks
the
wintry
logic
of
facts
would
in
any
case
decide
him
to
lay
up
his
yacht
for
he
could
scarcely
think
of
sailing
home
at
such
a
season
i
could
then
take
a
chance
lying
ready
of
spending
a
few
weeks
in
dresden
or
elsewhere
i
settled
this
programme
comfortably
and
then
turned
in
from
flushing
eastward
to
hamburg
then
northward
to
flensburg
i
cut
short
the
next
day
sultry
story
past
dyke
and
windmill
and
still
canals
on
to
blazing
stubbles
and
roaring
towns
at
the
last
after
dusk
through
a
quiet
level
region
where
the
train
pottered
from
one
lazy
little
station
to
another
and
at
ten
i
found
myself
stiff
and
stuffy
on
the
platform
at
flensburg
exchanging
greetings
with
davies
awfully
good
of
you
to
come
at
all
it
very
good
of
you
to
ask
me
we
were
both
of
us
ill
at
ease
even
in
the
dim
gaslight
he
clashed
on
my
notions
of
a
yachtsman
no
cool
white
ducks
or
neat
blue
serge
and
where
was
the
snowy
crowned
yachting
cap
that
precious
charm
that
so
easily
converts
a
landsman
into
a
dashing
mariner
conscious
that
this
impressive
uniform
in
high
perfection
was
lying
ready
in
my
portmanteau
i
felt
oddly
guilty
he
wore
an
old
norfolk
jacket
muddy
brown
shoes
grey
flannel
trousers
or
had
they
been
white
and
an
ordinary
tweed
cap
the
hand
he
gave
me
was
horny
and
appeared
to
be
stained
with
paint
the
other
one
which
carried
a
parcel
had
a
bandage
on
it
which
would
have
borne
renewal
there
was
an
instant
of
mutual
inspection
i
thought
he
gave
me
a
shy
hurried
scrutiny
as
though
to
test
past
conjectures
with
something
of
anxiety
in
it
and
perhaps
save
the
mark
a
tinge
of
admiration
the
face
was
familiar
and
yet
not
familiar
the
pleasant
blue
eyes
open
features
unintellectual
forehead
were
the
same
so
were
the
brisk
and
impulsive
movements
there
was
some
change
but
the
moment
of
awkward
hesitation
was
over
and
the
light
was
bad
and
while
strolling
down
the
platform
for
my
luggage
we
chatted
with
constraint
about
trivial
things
the
way
he
suddenly
said
laughing
afraid
i
not
fit
to
be
seen
but
it
so
late
it
does
matter
i
been
painting
hard
all
day
and
just
got
it
finished
i
only
hope
we
shall
have
some
wind
it
been
hopelessly
calm
lately
i
say
brought
a
good
deal
of
stuff
he
concluded
as
my
belongings
began
to
collect
here
was
a
reward
for
my
submissive
exertions
in
the
far
east
gave
me
a
good
many
commissions
i
did
mean
those
things
he
said
absently
for
bringing
them
by
the
way
that
the
stove
i
suppose
cartridges
this
one
by
the
weight
you
got
the
all
right
i
hope
they
not
really
necessary
of
course
i
nodded
vacantly
and
felt
a
little
hurt
they
simpler
than
lanyards
and
you
ca
get
them
here
it
that
portmanteau
he
said
slowly
measuring
it
with
a
doubtful
eye
mind
we
try
you
could
do
with
the
gladstone
only
i
suppose
you
see
the
dinghy
h
and
there
the
hatchway
too
he
was
lost
in
thought
we
try
i
afraid
there
are
no
cabs
but
it
quite
near
and
the
porter
help
sickening
forebodings
crept
over
me
while
davies
shouldered
my
gladstone
and
clutched
at
the
parcels
your
men
here
i
asked
faintly
he
looked
confused
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
told
you
i
never
have
any
paid
hands
it
quite
a
small
boat
you
know
i
hope
you
did
expect
luxury
i
managed
her
for
some
time
a
man
would
be
no
use
and
a
horrible
nuisance
he
revealed
these
appalling
truths
with
a
cheerful
assurance
which
did
nothing
to
hide
a
na√Øve
apprehension
of
their
effect
on
me
there
was
a
check
in
our
mobilization
rather
late
to
go
on
board
is
it
i
said
in
a
wooden
voice
someone
was
turning
out
the
gaslights
and
the
porter
yawned
ostentatiously
think
i
rather
sleep
at
an
hotel
a
strained
pause
of
course
you
can
do
that
if
you
like
said
davies
in
transparent
distress
of
mind
it
seems
hardly
worth
while
to
cart
this
stuff
all
the
way
to
an
hotel
i
believe
they
all
on
the
other
side
of
the
harbour
and
back
again
to
the
boat
she
quite
comfortable
and
you
sure
to
sleep
well
as
tired
can
leave
the
things
here
i
argued
feebly
walk
over
with
my
bag
i
shall
have
to
go
aboard
anyhow
he
rejoined
sleep
on
shore
he
seemed
to
be
clinging
timidly
but
desperately
to
some
diplomatic
end
a
stony
despair
was
invading
me
and
paralysing
resistance
better
face
the
worst
and
be
done
with
it
on
i
said
grimly
heavily
loaded
we
stumbled
over
railway
lines
and
rubble
heaps
and
came
on
the
harbour
davies
led
the
way
to
a
stairway
whose
weedy
steps
disappeared
below
in
gloom
you
get
into
the
dinghy
he
said
all
briskness
now
pass
the
things
down
i
descended
gingerly
holding
as
a
guide
a
sodden
painter
which
ended
in
a
small
boat
and
conscious
that
i
was
collecting
slime
on
cuffs
and
trousers
up
shouted
davies
cheerfully
as
i
sat
down
suddenly
near
the
bottom
with
one
foot
in
the
water
i
climbed
wretchedly
into
the
dinghy
and
awaited
events
float
her
up
close
under
the
quay
wall
and
make
fast
to
the
ring
down
there
came
down
from
above
followed
by
the
slack
of
the
sodden
painter
which
knocked
my
cap
off
as
it
fell
fast
any
knot
do
i
heard
as
i
grappled
with
this
loathsome
task
and
then
a
big
dark
object
loomed
overhead
and
was
lowered
into
the
dinghy
it
was
my
portmanteau
and
placed
athwart
exactly
filled
all
the
space
amidships
it
fit
was
the
anxious
inquiry
from
aloft
scratching
at
the
greasy
wall
to
keep
the
dinghy
close
to
it
i
received
in
succession
our
stores
and
stowed
the
cargo
as
best
i
could
while
the
dinghy
sank
lower
and
lower
in
the
water
and
its
precarious
superstructure
grew
higher
was
the
final
direction
from
above
and
a
damp
soft
parcel
hit
me
in
the
chest
careful
of
that
it
meat
now
back
to
the
stairs
i
painfully
acquiesced
and
davies
appeared
a
bit
of
a
load
and
she
rather
deep
but
i
we
shall
manage
he
reflected
sit
right
aft
and
i
row
i
was
too
far
gone
for
curiosity
as
to
how
this
monstrous
pyramid
was
to
be
rowed
or
even
for
surmises
as
to
its
foundering
by
the
way
i
crawled
to
my
appointed
seat
and
davies
extricated
the
buried
sculls
by
a
series
of
tugs
which
shook
the
whole
structure
and
made
us
roll
alarmingly
how
he
stowed
himself
into
rowing
posture
i
have
not
the
least
idea
but
eventually
we
were
moving
sluggishly
out
into
the
open
water
his
head
just
visible
in
the
bows
we
had
started
from
what
appeared
to
be
the
head
of
a
narrow
loch
and
were
leaving
behind
us
the
lights
of
a
big
town
a
long
frontage
of
quays
was
on
our
left
with
here
and
there
the
vague
hull
of
a
steamer
alongside
we
passed
the
last
of
the
lights
and
came
out
into
a
broader
stretch
of
water
when
a
light
breeze
was
blowing
and
dark
hills
could
be
seen
on
either
shore
lying
a
little
way
down
the
fiord
you
see
said
davies
hate
to
be
too
near
a
town
and
i
found
a
carpenter
handy
here
there
she
is
i
wonder
how
you
like
her
i
roused
myself
we
were
entering
a
little
cove
encircled
by
trees
and
approaching
a
light
which
flickered
in
the
rigging
of
a
small
vessel
whose
outline
gradually
defined
itself
her
off
said
davies
as
we
drew
alongside
in
a
moment
he
had
jumped
on
deck
tied
the
painter
and
was
round
at
my
end
hand
them
up
he
ordered
i
take
them
it
was
a
laborious
task
with
the
one
relief
that
it
was
not
far
to
hand
them
a
doubtful
compensation
for
other
reasons
distantly
shaping
themselves
when
the
stack
was
transferred
to
the
deck
i
followed
it
tripping
over
the
flabby
meat
parcel
which
was
already
showing
ghastly
signs
of
disintegration
under
the
dew
hazily
there
floated
through
my
mind
my
last
embarkation
on
a
yacht
my
faultless
attire
the
trim
gig
and
obsequious
sailors
the
accommodation
ladder
flashing
with
varnish
and
brass
in
the
august
sun
the
orderly
snowy
decks
and
basket
chairs
under
the
awning
aft
what
a
contrast
with
this
sordid
midnight
scramble
over
damp
meat
and
littered
the
bitterest
touch
of
all
was
a
growing
sense
of
inferiority
and
ignorance
which
i
had
never
before
been
allowed
to
feel
in
my
experience
of
yachts
davies
awoke
from
another
reverie
over
my
portmanteau
to
say
cheerily
just
show
you
round
down
below
first
and
then
stow
things
away
and
get
to
bed
he
dived
down
a
companion
ladder
and
i
followed
cautiously
a
complex
odour
of
paraffin
past
cookery
tobacco
and
tar
saluted
my
nostrils
your
head
said
davies
striking
a
match
and
lighting
a
candle
while
i
groped
into
the
cabin
better
sit
down
easier
to
look
round
there
might
well
have
been
sarcasm
in
this
piece
of
advice
for
i
must
have
cut
a
ridiculous
figure
peering
awkwardly
and
suspiciously
round
with
shoulders
and
head
bent
to
avoid
the
ceiling
which
seemed
in
the
to
be
even
nearer
the
floor
than
it
was
see
were
davies
reassuring
words
plenty
of
room
to
upright
which
was
strictly
true
but
i
am
not
very
tall
and
he
is
short
people
make
a
point
of
but
i
never
mind
much
about
it
that
the
centreboard
case
he
explained
as
in
stretching
my
legs
out
my
knee
came
into
contact
with
a
sharp
edge
i
had
not
seen
this
devilish
obstruction
as
it
was
hidden
beneath
the
table
which
indeed
rested
on
it
at
one
end
it
appeared
to
be
a
long
low
triangle
running
lengthways
with
the
boat
and
dividing
the
naturally
limited
space
into
two
see
she
a
boat
drawing
very
little
water
without
the
plate
that
why
there
so
little
headroom
for
deep
water
you
lower
the
plate
so
in
one
way
or
another
you
can
go
practically
anywhere
i
was
not
nautical
enough
to
draw
any
very
definite
conclusions
from
this
but
what
i
did
draw
were
not
promising
the
latter
sentences
were
spoken
from
the
forecastle
whither
davies
had
crept
through
a
low
sliding
door
like
that
of
a
and
was
already
busy
with
a
kettle
over
a
stove
which
i
made
out
to
be
a
battered
and
disreputable
twin
brother
of
the
no
rippingille
be
boiling
soon
he
remarked
we
have
some
grog
my
eyes
were
used
to
the
light
now
and
i
took
in
the
rest
of
my
surroundings
which
may
be
very
simply
described
two
long
seats
flanked
the
cabin
bounded
at
the
after
end
by
cupboards
one
of
which
was
cut
low
to
form
a
sort
of
miniature
sideboard
with
glasses
hung
in
a
rack
above
it
the
deck
overhead
was
very
low
at
each
side
but
rose
shoulder
high
for
a
space
in
the
middle
where
a
roof
with
a
skylight
gave
additional
cabin
space
just
outside
the
door
was
a
on
either
wall
were
long
holding
a
medley
of
flags
charts
caps
banks
of
yam
and
such
like
across
the
forward
bulkhead
was
a
bookshelf
crammed
to
overflowing
with
volumes
of
all
sizes
many
upside
down
and
some
coverless
below
this
were
a
an
aneroid
and
a
clock
with
a
hearty
tick
all
the
woodwork
was
painted
white
and
to
a
less
jaundiced
eye
than
mine
the
interior
might
have
had
an
enticing
look
of
snugness
some
kodak
prints
were
nailed
roughly
on
the
after
bulkhead
and
just
over
the
doorway
was
the
photograph
of
a
young
girl
my
sister
said
davies
who
had
emerged
and
saw
me
looking
at
it
let
get
the
stuff
down
he
ran
up
the
ladder
and
soon
my
portmanteau
blackened
the
hatchway
and
a
great
straining
and
squeezing
began
was
afraid
it
was
too
big
came
down
sorry
but
you
have
to
unpack
on
deck
we
may
be
able
to
squash
it
down
when
it
empty
then
the
wearisome
tail
of
packages
began
to
form
a
fresh
stack
in
the
cramped
space
at
my
feet
and
my
back
ached
with
stooping
and
moiling
in
unfamiliar
places
davies
came
down
and
with
unconcealed
pride
introduced
me
to
the
sleeping
cabin
he
called
the
other
one
saloon
another
candle
was
lit
and
showed
two
short
and
narrow
berths
with
blankets
but
no
sign
of
sheets
beneath
these
were
drawers
one
set
of
which
davies
made
me
master
of
evidently
thinking
them
a
princely
allowance
of
space
for
my
wardrobe
can
chuck
your
things
down
the
skylight
on
to
your
berth
as
you
unpack
them
he
remarked
the
way
i
doubt
if
there
room
for
all
you
got
i
suppose
you
could
manage
i
could
i
said
shortly
the
absurdity
of
argument
struck
me
two
men
doubled
up
like
monkeys
can
not
argue
you
go
out
i
shall
be
able
to
get
out
too
i
added
he
seemed
miserable
at
this
ghost
of
an
altercation
but
i
pushed
past
mounted
the
ladder
and
in
the
expiring
moonlight
unstrapped
that
accursed
portmanteau
and
brimming
over
with
irritation
groped
among
its
contents
sorting
some
into
the
skylight
with
the
same
feeling
that
nothing
mattered
much
now
and
it
was
best
to
be
done
with
it
repacking
the
rest
with
guilty
stealth
ere
davies
should
discover
their
character
and
strapping
up
the
whole
again
then
i
sat
down
upon
my
white
elephant
and
shivered
for
the
chill
of
autumn
was
in
the
air
it
suddenly
struck
me
that
if
it
had
been
raining
things
might
have
been
worse
still
the
notion
made
me
look
round
the
little
cove
was
still
as
glass
stars
above
and
stars
below
a
few
white
cottages
glimmering
at
one
point
on
the
shore
in
the
west
the
lights
of
flensburg
to
the
east
the
fiord
broadening
into
unknown
gloom
from
davies
toiling
below
there
were
muffled
sounds
of
wrenching
pushing
and
hammering
punctuated
occasionally
by
a
heavy
splash
as
something
shot
up
from
the
hatchway
and
fell
into
the
water
how
it
came
about
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
something
pathetic
in
the
look
i
had
last
seen
on
his
face
a
look
which
i
associated
for
no
reason
whatever
with
his
bandaged
hand
whether
it
was
one
of
those
instants
of
clear
vision
in
which
our
separate
selves
are
seen
divided
the
baser
from
the
better
and
i
saw
my
silly
egotism
in
contrast
with
a
simple
generous
nature
whether
it
was
an
impalpable
air
of
mystery
which
pervaded
the
whole
enterprise
and
refused
to
be
dissipated
by
its
most
mortifying
and
vulgarizing
incidents
a
mystery
dimly
connected
with
my
companion
obvious
consciousness
of
having
misled
me
into
joining
him
whether
it
was
only
the
stars
and
the
cool
air
rousing
atrophied
instincts
of
youth
and
spirits
probably
indeed
it
was
all
these
influences
cemented
into
strength
by
a
ruthless
sense
of
humour
which
whispered
that
i
was
in
danger
of
making
a
mere
commonplace
fool
of
myself
in
spite
of
all
my
laboured
calculations
but
whatever
it
was
in
a
flash
my
mood
changed
the
crown
of
martyrdom
disappeared
the
wounded
vanity
healed
that
precious
fund
of
fictitious
resignation
drained
away
but
left
no
void
there
was
left
a
fashionable
and
dishevelled
young
man
sitting
in
the
dew
and
in
the
dark
on
a
ridiculous
portmanteau
which
dwarfed
the
yacht
that
was
to
carry
it
a
youth
acutely
sensible
of
ignorance
in
a
strange
and
strenuous
atmosphere
still
feeling
sore
and
victimized
but
withal
sanely
ashamed
and
sanely
resolved
to
enjoy
himself
i
anticipate
for
though
the
change
was
radical
its
full
growth
was
slow
but
in
any
case
it
was
here
and
now
that
it
took
its
birth
ready
came
from
below
bunching
myself
for
the
descent
i
found
to
my
astonishment
that
all
trace
of
litter
had
miraculously
vanished
and
a
cosy
neatness
reigned
glasses
and
lemons
were
on
the
table
and
a
fragrant
smell
of
punch
had
deadened
previous
odours
i
showed
little
emotion
at
these
amenities
but
enough
to
give
intense
relief
to
davies
who
delightedly
showed
me
his
devices
for
storage
praising
the
of
his
floating
den
your
stove
you
see
he
ended
chucked
the
old
one
overboard
it
was
a
weakness
of
his
i
should
say
here
to
rejoice
in
throwing
things
overboard
on
the
flimsiest
pretexts
i
afterwards
suspected
that
the
new
stove
had
not
been
necessary
any
more
than
the
but
was
an
excuse
for
gratifying
this
curious
taste
we
smoked
and
chatted
for
a
little
and
then
came
the
problem
of
going
to
bed
after
much
bumping
of
knuckles
and
head
and
many
giddy
writhings
i
mastered
it
and
lay
between
the
rough
blankets
davies
moving
swiftly
and
deftly
was
soon
in
his
quite
comfortable
is
it
he
said
as
he
blew
out
the
light
from
where
he
lay
with
an
accuracy
which
must
have
been
the
fruit
of
long
practice
i
felt
prickly
all
over
and
there
was
a
damp
patch
on
the
pillow
which
was
soon
explained
by
a
heavy
drop
of
moisture
falling
on
my
forehead
suppose
the
deck
not
leaking
i
said
as
mildly
as
i
could
awfully
sorry
said
davies
earnestly
tumbling
out
of
his
bunk
must
be
the
heavy
dew
i
did
a
lot
of
caulking
yesterday
but
i
suppose
i
missed
that
place
i
run
up
and
square
it
with
an
oilskin
wrong
with
your
hand
i
asked
sleepily
on
his
return
for
gratitude
reminded
me
of
that
bandage
much
i
strained
it
the
other
day
was
the
reply
and
then
the
seemingly
inconsequent
remark
glad
you
brought
that
prismatic
compass
it
not
really
necessary
of
course
muffled
by
blankets
may
come
in
useful
iii
davies
i
dozed
but
fitfully
with
a
fretful
sense
of
sore
elbows
and
neck
and
many
a
draughty
hiatus
among
the
blankets
it
was
broad
daylight
before
i
had
reached
the
stage
of
torpor
in
which
such
slumber
merges
that
was
finally
broken
by
the
descent
through
the
skylight
of
a
torrent
of
water
i
started
up
bumped
my
head
hard
against
the
decks
and
blinked
upwards
i
scrubbing
decks
come
up
and
bathe
slept
well
i
heard
a
voice
saying
from
aloft
well
i
growled
stepping
out
into
a
pool
of
water
on
the
oilcloth
thence
i
stumbled
up
the
ladder
dived
overboard
and
buried
bad
dreams
stiffness
frowsiness
and
tormented
nerves
in
the
loveliest
fiord
of
the
lovely
baltic
a
short
and
furious
swim
and
i
was
back
again
searching
for
a
means
of
ascent
up
the
smooth
black
side
which
low
as
it
was
was
slippery
and
unsympathetic
davies
in
a
loose
canvas
shirt
with
the
sleeves
tucked
up
and
flannels
rolled
up
to
the
knee
hung
over
me
with
a
rope
end
and
chatted
unconcernedly
about
the
easiness
of
the
job
when
you
know
how
adjuring
me
to
mind
the
paint
and
talking
about
an
accommodation
ladder
he
had
once
had
but
had
thrown
overboard
because
it
was
so
horribly
in
the
way
when
i
arrived
my
knees
and
elbows
were
picked
out
in
black
paint
to
his
consternation
nevertheless
as
i
plied
the
towel
i
knew
that
i
had
left
in
those
limpid
depths
yet
another
crust
of
discontent
and
as
i
dressed
into
flannels
and
blazer
i
looked
round
the
deck
and
with
an
unskilled
and
doubtful
eye
took
in
all
that
the
darkness
had
hitherto
hidden
she
seemed
very
small
in
point
of
fact
she
was
seven
tons
something
over
thirty
feet
in
length
and
nine
in
beam
a
size
very
suitable
to
in
the
solent
for
such
as
liked
that
sort
of
thing
but
that
she
should
have
come
from
dover
to
the
baltic
suggested
a
world
of
physical
endeavour
of
which
i
had
never
dreamed
i
passed
to
the
√¶sthetic
side
smartness
and
beauty
were
essential
to
yachts
in
my
mind
but
with
the
best
resolves
to
be
pleased
i
found
little
encouragement
here
the
hull
seemed
too
low
and
the
mainmast
too
high
the
cabin
roof
looked
clumsy
and
the
skylights
saddened
the
eye
with
dull
iron
and
plebeian
graining
what
brass
there
was
on
the
and
elsewhere
was
tarnished
with
sickly
green
the
decks
had
none
of
that
creamy
purity
which
cowes
expects
but
were
rough
and
grey
and
showed
tarry
exhalations
round
the
seams
and
rusty
stains
near
the
bows
the
ropes
and
rigging
were
in
mourning
when
contrasted
with
the
delicate
buff
manilla
so
satisfying
to
the
artistic
eye
as
seen
against
the
blue
of
a
june
sky
at
southsea
nor
was
the
whole
effect
bettered
by
many
signs
of
recent
refitting
an
impression
of
paint
varnish
and
carpentry
was
in
the
air
a
gaudy
new
burgee
fluttered
aloft
there
seemed
to
be
a
new
rope
or
two
especially
round
the
diminutive
which
itself
looked
altogether
new
but
all
this
only
emphasized
the
general
plainness
reminding
one
of
a
respectable
woman
of
the
trying
to
dress
above
her
station
and
soon
likely
to
give
it
up
that
the
was
businesslike
and
solid
even
my
untrained
eye
could
see
many
of
the
deck
fittings
seemed
disproportionately
substantial
the
looked
contemptuous
of
its
charge
the
binnacle
with
its
compass
was
of
a
size
and
prominence
almost
comically
impressive
and
was
moreover
the
only
piece
of
brass
which
was
burnished
and
showed
traces
of
reverent
care
two
huge
coils
of
stout
and
dingy
warp
lay
just
abaft
the
mainmast
and
summed
up
the
aspect
of
the
little
ship
i
should
add
here
that
in
the
distant
past
she
had
been
a
lifeboat
and
had
been
clumsily
converted
into
a
yacht
by
the
addition
of
a
counter
deck
and
the
necessary
spars
she
was
built
as
all
lifeboats
are
diagonally
of
two
skins
of
teak
and
thus
had
immense
strength
though
in
the
matter
of
looks
all
a
hybrid
failings
hunger
and
made
from
below
brought
me
down
to
the
cabin
where
i
found
breakfast
laid
out
on
the
table
over
the
centreboard
case
with
davies
earnestly
presiding
rather
flushed
as
to
the
face
and
sooty
as
to
the
fingers
there
was
a
slight
shortage
of
plate
and
crockery
but
i
praised
the
bacon
and
could
do
so
truthfully
for
its
crisp
and
steaming
shavings
would
have
put
to
shame
the
efforts
of
my
london
cook
indeed
i
should
have
enjoyed
the
meal
heartily
were
it
not
for
the
lowness
of
the
sofa
and
table
causing
a
curvature
of
the
body
which
made
swallowing
a
more
lengthy
process
than
usual
and
induced
a
periodical
yearning
to
get
up
and
stretch
a
relief
which
spelt
disaster
to
the
skull
i
noticed
too
that
davies
spoke
with
a
zest
sinister
to
me
of
the
delights
of
white
bread
and
fresh
milk
which
he
seemed
to
consider
unusual
luxuries
though
suitable
to
an
inaugural
banquet
in
honour
of
a
fastidious
stranger
ca
be
always
going
on
shore
he
said
when
i
showed
a
discreet
interest
in
these
things
lived
for
ten
days
on
a
big
rye
loaf
over
in
the
frisian
islands
it
died
hard
i
suppose
hard
but
gravely
good
after
that
i
taught
myself
to
make
rolls
had
no
baking
powder
at
first
so
used
eno
fruit
salt
but
they
would
rise
much
with
that
as
for
milk
condensed
is
i
hope
you
do
mind
it
i
changed
the
subject
and
asked
about
his
plans
get
under
way
at
once
he
said
sail
down
the
fiord
i
tried
for
something
more
specific
but
he
was
gone
and
his
voice
drowned
in
the
by
the
clatter
and
swish
of
washing
up
thenceforward
events
moved
with
bewildering
rapidity
humbly
desirous
of
being
useful
i
joined
him
on
deck
only
to
find
that
he
scarcely
noticed
me
save
as
a
new
and
unexpected
obstacle
in
his
round
of
activity
he
was
everywhere
at
once
heaving
in
chain
hooking
on
halyards
hauling
ropes
while
my
part
became
that
of
the
clown
who
does
things
after
they
are
already
done
for
my
knowledge
of
a
yacht
was
of
that
floating
and
inaccurate
kind
which
is
useless
in
practice
soon
the
anchor
was
up
a
great
rusty
monster
it
was
the
sails
set
and
davies
was
darting
swiftly
to
and
fro
between
the
tiller
and
while
the
bowed
a
lingering
farewell
to
the
shore
and
headed
for
the
open
fiord
erratic
puffs
from
the
high
land
behind
made
her
progress
timorous
at
first
but
soon
the
fairway
was
reached
and
a
true
breeze
from
flensburg
and
the
west
took
her
in
its
friendly
grip
steadily
she
rustled
down
the
calm
blue
highway
whose
soft
beauty
was
the
introduction
to
a
passage
in
my
life
short
but
pregnant
with
moulding
force
through
stress
and
strain
for
me
and
others
davies
was
gradually
resuming
his
natural
self
with
abstracted
intervals
in
which
he
lashed
the
helm
to
finger
a
distant
rope
with
such
speed
that
the
movements
seemed
simultaneous
once
he
vanished
only
to
reappear
in
an
instant
with
a
chart
which
he
studied
while
steering
with
a
success
that
its
reluctant
folds
seemed
to
render
impossible
waiting
respectfully
for
his
revival
i
had
full
time
to
look
about
the
fiord
here
was
about
a
mile
broad
from
the
shore
we
had
left
the
hills
rose
steeply
but
with
no
rugged
grandeur
the
outlines
were
soft
there
were
green
spaces
and
rich
woods
on
the
lower
slopes
a
little
white
town
was
opening
up
in
one
place
and
scattered
farms
dotted
the
prospect
the
other
shore
which
i
could
just
see
framed
between
the
gunwale
and
the
mainsail
as
i
sat
leaning
against
the
hatchway
and
sadly
missing
a
was
lower
and
lonelier
though
prosperous
and
pleasing
to
the
eye
spacious
pastures
led
up
by
slow
degrees
to
ordered
clusters
of
wood
which
hinted
at
the
presence
of
some
great
manor
house
behind
us
flensburg
was
settling
into
haze
ahead
the
scene
was
shut
in
by
the
contours
of
hills
some
clear
some
dreamy
and
distant
lastly
a
single
glimpse
of
water
shining
between
the
folds
of
hill
far
away
hinted
at
spaces
of
distant
sea
of
which
this
was
but
a
secluded
inlet
everywhere
was
that
peculiar
charm
engendered
by
the
association
of
quiet
pastoral
country
and
a
homely
human
atmosphere
with
a
branch
of
the
great
ocean
that
bathes
all
the
shores
of
our
globe
there
was
another
charm
in
the
scene
due
to
the
way
in
which
i
was
viewing
it
not
as
a
pampered
passenger
on
a
steam
yacht
or
even
on
powerful
modern
schooner
as
the
yacht
agents
advertise
but
from
the
deck
of
a
scrubby
little
craft
of
doubtful
build
and
distressing
plainness
which
yet
had
smelt
her
persistent
way
to
this
distant
fiord
through
i
knew
not
what
of
difficulty
and
danger
with
no
apparent
motive
in
her
single
occupant
who
talked
as
vaguely
and
unconcernedly
about
his
adventurous
cruise
as
though
it
were
all
a
protracted
afternoon
on
southampton
water
i
glanced
round
at
davies
he
had
dropped
the
chart
and
was
sitting
or
rather
half
lying
on
the
deck
with
one
bronzed
arm
over
the
tiller
gazing
fixedly
ahead
with
just
an
occasional
glance
around
and
aloft
he
still
seemed
absorbed
in
himself
and
for
a
moment
or
two
i
studied
his
face
with
an
attention
i
had
never
since
i
had
known
him
given
it
i
had
always
thought
it
commonplace
as
i
had
thought
him
commonplace
so
far
as
i
had
thought
at
all
about
either
it
had
always
rather
irritated
me
by
an
excess
of
candour
and
boyishness
these
qualities
it
had
kept
but
the
scales
were
falling
from
my
eyes
and
i
saw
others
i
saw
strength
to
obstinacy
and
courage
to
recklessness
in
the
firm
lines
of
the
chin
an
older
and
deeper
look
in
the
eyes
those
odd
transitions
from
bright
mobility
to
detached
earnestness
which
had
partly
amused
and
chiefly
annoyed
me
hitherto
seemed
now
to
be
lost
in
a
sensitive
reserve
not
cold
or
egotistic
but
strangely
winning
from
its
paradoxical
frankness
sincerity
was
stamped
on
every
lineament
a
deep
misgiving
stirred
me
that
clever
as
i
thought
myself
nicely
perceptive
of
the
right
and
congenial
men
to
know
i
had
made
some
big
mistakes
how
many
i
wondered
a
relief
scarcely
less
deep
because
it
was
unconfessed
stole
in
on
me
with
the
suspicion
that
little
as
i
deserved
it
the
patient
fates
were
offering
me
a
golden
chance
of
repairing
at
least
one
and
yet
i
mused
the
patient
fates
have
crooked
methods
besides
a
certain
mischievous
humour
for
it
was
davies
who
had
asked
me
out
though
now
he
scarcely
seemed
to
need
me
almost
tricked
me
into
coming
out
for
he
might
have
known
i
was
not
suited
to
such
a
life
yet
trickery
and
davies
sounded
an
odd
conjuncture
probably
it
was
the
growing
discomfort
of
my
attitude
which
produced
this
backsliding
my
night
rest
and
the
from
the
bath
had
in
fact
done
little
to
prepare
me
for
contact
with
sharp
edges
and
hard
surfaces
but
davies
had
suddenly
come
to
himself
and
with
an
say
are
you
comfortable
have
something
to
sit
on
jerked
the
helm
a
little
to
windward
felt
it
like
a
pulse
for
a
moment
with
a
rapid
look
to
windward
and
dived
below
whence
he
returned
with
a
couple
of
cushions
which
he
threw
to
me
i
felt
perversely
resentful
of
these
luxuries
and
asked
i
be
of
any
use
do
you
bother
he
answered
expect
you
tired
we
having
a
splendid
sail
that
must
be
ekken
on
the
port
bow
peering
under
the
sail
the
trees
run
in
i
say
do
you
mind
looking
at
the
chart
he
tossed
it
over
to
me
i
spread
it
out
painfully
for
it
curled
up
like
a
at
the
least
slackening
of
pressure
i
was
not
familiar
with
charts
and
this
sudden
trust
reposed
in
me
after
a
good
deal
of
neglect
made
me
nervous
see
flensburg
do
you
he
said
where
we
are
dabbing
with
a
long
reach
at
an
indefinite
space
on
the
crowded
sheet
which
side
of
that
buoy
off
the
point
do
we
pass
i
had
scarcely
taken
in
which
was
land
and
which
was
water
much
less
the
significance
of
the
buoy
when
he
resumed
mind
i
pretty
sure
it
all
deep
water
about
here
i
expect
that
marks
the
fairway
for
steamers
in
a
minute
or
two
we
were
passing
the
buoy
in
question
on
the
wrong
side
i
am
pretty
certain
for
weeds
and
sand
came
suddenly
into
view
below
us
with
uncomfortable
distinctness
but
all
davies
said
was
never
any
sea
here
and
the
plate
not
down
a
dark
utterance
which
i
pondered
doubtfully
best
of
these
schleswig
waters
he
went
on
that
a
boat
of
this
size
can
go
almost
anywhere
there
no
navigation
required
why
at
this
moment
a
faint
scraping
was
felt
rather
than
heard
beneath
us
we
aground
i
asked
with
great
calmness
she
blow
over
he
replied
wincing
a
little
she
over
but
the
episode
caused
a
little
na√Øve
vexation
in
davies
i
relate
it
as
a
good
instance
of
one
of
his
minor
peculiarities
he
was
utterly
without
that
didactic
pedantry
which
yachting
has
a
fatal
tendency
to
engender
in
men
who
profess
it
he
had
tossed
me
the
chart
without
a
thought
that
i
was
an
ignoramus
to
whom
it
would
be
greek
and
who
would
provide
him
with
an
admirable
subject
to
drill
and
lecture
just
as
his
neglect
of
me
throughout
the
morning
had
been
merely
habitual
and
unconscious
independence
in
the
second
place
master
of
his
as
i
knew
him
afterwards
to
be
resourceful
skilful
and
alert
he
was
liable
to
lapse
into
a
certain
amateurish
vagueness
half
irritating
and
half
amusing
i
think
truly
that
both
these
peculiarities
came
from
the
same
source
a
hatred
of
any
sort
of
affectation
to
the
same
source
i
traced
the
fact
that
he
and
his
yacht
observed
none
of
the
superficial
etiquette
of
yachts
and
yachtsmen
that
she
never
for
instance
flew
a
national
ensign
and
he
never
wore
a
suit
we
rounded
a
low
green
point
which
i
had
scarcely
noticed
before
must
jibe
said
davies
take
the
helm
will
you
and
without
waiting
for
my
he
began
hauling
in
the
mainsheet
with
great
vigour
i
had
rude
notions
of
steering
but
jibing
is
a
delicate
operation
no
yachtsman
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that
the
boom
saw
its
opportunity
and
swung
over
with
a
mighty
crash
with
the
mainsheet
entangled
round
me
and
the
tiller
all
standing
was
his
sorrowful
comment
not
used
to
her
yet
she
very
quick
on
the
helm
am
i
to
steer
for
i
asked
wildly
do
trouble
i
take
her
now
he
replied
i
felt
it
was
time
to
make
my
position
clear
an
utter
duffer
at
sailing
i
began
have
a
lot
to
teach
me
or
one
of
these
days
i
shall
be
wrecking
you
you
see
there
always
been
a
crew
with
sovereign
contempt
the
whole
fun
of
the
thing
is
to
do
everything
oneself
i
felt
in
the
way
the
whole
morning
awfully
sorry
his
dismay
and
repentance
were
comical
it
just
the
other
way
you
may
be
all
the
use
in
the
world
he
became
absent
we
were
following
the
inward
trend
of
a
small
bay
towards
a
cleft
in
the
low
shore
ekken
sound
said
davies
look
into
it
and
a
minute
or
two
later
we
were
drifting
through
a
dainty
little
strait
with
a
peep
of
open
water
at
the
end
of
it
cottages
bordered
either
side
some
overhanging
the
very
water
some
connecting
with
it
by
a
rickety
wooden
staircase
or
a
miniature
creepers
and
roses
rioted
over
the
walls
and
tiny
porches
for
a
space
on
one
side
a
rude
quay
with
small
smacks
floating
off
it
spoke
of
some
minute
commercial
interests
a
very
small
with
bowers
and
tables
hinted
at
some
equally
minute
tripping
interest
a
pervading
hue
of
mingled
bronze
and
rose
came
partly
from
the
woodwork
of
the
cottages
and
stages
and
partly
from
the
creepers
and
the
trees
behind
where
autumn
subtle
fingers
were
already
at
work
down
this
exquisite
we
glided
till
it
ended
in
a
broad
mere
where
our
sails
which
had
been
shivering
and
complaining
filled
into
contented
silence
about
said
davies
callously
must
get
out
of
this
again
and
round
we
swung
not
anchor
and
stop
here
i
protested
for
a
view
of
tantalizing
loveliness
was
unfolding
itself
we
seen
all
there
is
to
be
seen
and
we
must
take
this
breeze
while
we
got
it
it
was
always
torture
to
davies
to
feel
a
good
breeze
running
to
waste
while
he
was
inactive
at
anchor
or
on
shore
the
to
him
was
an
inferior
element
merely
serving
as
a
useful
annexe
to
the
water
a
source
of
necessary
supplies
have
lunch
he
pursued
as
we
resumed
our
way
down
the
fiord
a
vision
of
iced
drinks
tempting
salads
white
napery
and
an
attentive
steward
mocked
me
with
past
recollections
find
a
tongue
said
the
voice
of
doom
the
starboard
beer
under
the
floor
in
the
bilge
i
see
her
round
that
buoy
if
you
would
mind
beginning
i
obeyed
with
a
bad
grace
but
the
close
air
and
cramped
posture
must
have
benumbed
my
faculties
for
i
opened
the
locker
reached
down
and
grasped
a
sticky
body
which
turned
out
to
be
a
pot
of
varnish
recoiling
wretchedly
i
tried
the
opposite
one
combating
the
embarrassing
heel
of
the
boat
and
the
obstructive
edges
of
the
centreboard
case
a
medley
of
damp
tins
of
varied
sizes
showed
in
the
gloom
exuding
a
mouldy
odour
faded
legends
on
dissolving
paper
like
the
remnants
of
old
posters
on
a
disused
hoarding
spoke
of
soups
curries
beefs
potted
meats
and
other
hidden
delicacies
i
picked
out
a
tongue
the
odour
and
explored
for
beer
it
was
true
i
supposed
that
bilge
did
hurt
it
as
i
tugged
at
the
plank
on
my
hands
and
knees
but
i
should
have
myself
preferred
a
more
accessible
and
less
humid
than
the
cavities
among
slimy
ballast
from
which
i
dug
the
bottles
i
regarded
my
and
pledges
of
a
meal
with
giddiness
and
discouragement
are
you
getting
on
shouted
davies
hanging
up
on
the
bulkhead
the
plates
and
knives
are
in
the
cupboard
i
doggedly
pursued
my
functions
the
plates
and
knives
met
me
for
being
on
the
weather
side
and
thus
having
a
downward
slant
its
contents
when
i
slipped
the
latch
slid
affectionately
into
my
bosom
and
overflowed
with
a
clatter
and
jingle
on
to
the
floor
often
happens
i
heard
from
above
mind
there
are
no
breakables
i
coming
down
to
help
and
down
he
came
leaving
the
to
her
own
devices
think
i
go
on
deck
i
said
in
the
world
could
you
lunch
comfortably
at
ekken
and
save
this
infernal
pandemonium
of
a
picnic
where
the
yacht
going
to
meanwhile
and
how
are
we
to
lunch
on
that
slanting
table
i
covered
with
varnish
and
mud
and
in
crockery
there
goes
the
beer
should
have
stood
it
on
the
table
with
this
list
on
said
davies
with
intense
composure
it
wo
do
any
harm
drain
into
the
bilge
ashes
to
ashes
dust
to
dust
i
thought
go
on
deck
now
and
i
finish
getting
ready
i
regretted
my
explosion
though
wrung
from
me
under
great
provocation
her
straight
on
as
she
going
said
davies
as
i
clambered
up
out
of
the
chaos
brushing
the
dust
off
my
trousers
and
varnishing
the
ladder
with
my
hands
i
unlashed
the
helm
and
kept
her
as
she
was
going
we
had
rounded
a
sharp
bend
in
the
fiord
and
were
sailing
up
a
broad
and
straight
reach
which
every
moment
disclosed
new
beauties
sights
fair
enough
to
be
balm
to
the
angriest
spirit
a
hamlet
was
on
our
left
on
the
right
an
ivied
ruin
close
to
the
water
where
some
contemplative
cattle
stood
the
view
ahead
was
a
white
strand
which
fringed
both
shores
and
to
it
fell
wooded
slopes
interrupted
here
and
there
by
low
sandstone
cliffs
of
warm
red
colouring
and
now
and
again
by
a
dingle
with
cracks
of
greensward
i
forgot
petty
squalors
and
enjoyed
things
the
coy
tremble
of
the
tiller
and
the
backwash
of
air
from
the
dingy
mainsail
and
with
a
somewhat
chastened
rapture
the
lunch
which
davies
brought
up
to
me
and
solicitously
watched
me
eat
later
as
the
wind
sank
to
lazy
airs
he
became
busy
with
a
larger
topsail
and
jib
but
i
was
content
to
doze
away
the
afternoon
drenching
brain
and
body
in
the
sweet
and
novel
foreign
atmosphere
and
dreamily
watching
the
fringe
of
glen
cliff
and
cool
white
sand
as
they
passed
ever
more
slowly
by
iv
retrospect
up
i
rubbed
my
eyes
and
wondered
where
i
was
stretched
myself
painfully
too
for
even
the
cushions
had
not
given
me
a
true
bed
of
roses
it
was
dusk
and
the
yacht
was
stationary
in
glassy
water
coloured
by
the
last
a
roofing
of
thin
had
spread
over
most
of
the
sky
and
a
subtle
smell
of
rain
was
in
the
air
we
seemed
to
be
in
the
middle
of
the
fiord
whose
shores
looked
distant
and
steep
in
the
gathering
darkness
close
ahead
they
faded
away
suddenly
and
the
sight
lost
itself
in
a
grey
void
the
stillness
was
absolute
ca
get
to
sonderburg
said
davies
to
be
done
then
i
asked
collecting
my
senses
we
anchor
anywhere
here
we
just
at
the
mouth
of
the
fiord
i
tow
her
inshore
if
you
steer
in
that
direction
he
pointed
vaguely
at
a
blur
of
trees
and
cliff
then
he
jumped
into
the
dinghy
cast
off
the
painter
and
after
snatching
at
the
slack
of
a
rope
began
towing
the
reluctant
yacht
by
short
jerks
of
the
sculls
the
menacing
aspect
of
that
grey
void
combined
with
a
natural
preference
for
getting
to
some
definite
place
at
night
combined
to
depress
my
spirits
afresh
in
my
sleep
i
had
dreamt
of
morven
lodge
of
heather
after
glorious
slaughters
of
grouse
of
salmon
leaping
in
amber
pools
and
now
take
a
cast
of
the
lead
will
you
came
davies
voice
above
the
splash
of
the
sculls
is
it
i
shouted
back
mind
we
close
enough
now
let
can
you
manage
to
let
go
the
anchor
i
hurried
forward
and
picked
impotently
at
the
bonds
of
the
sleeping
monster
but
davies
was
aboard
again
and
stirred
him
with
a
deft
touch
or
two
till
he
crashed
into
the
water
with
a
grinding
of
chain
shall
do
well
here
said
he
this
rather
an
open
anchorage
i
suggested
only
open
from
that
quarter
he
replied
it
comes
on
to
blow
from
there
we
shall
have
to
clear
out
but
i
think
it
only
rain
let
stow
the
sails
another
whirlwind
of
activity
in
which
i
joined
as
effectively
as
i
could
oppressed
by
the
prospect
of
having
to
out
who
knows
whither
at
midnight
but
davies
was
infectious
i
suppose
and
the
little
den
below
and
soon
fragrant
with
cookery
pleaded
insistently
for
affection
yachting
in
this
singular
style
was
hungry
work
i
found
steak
tastes
none
the
worse
for
having
been
wrapped
in
newspaper
and
the
slight
traces
of
the
news
disappear
with
frying
in
onions
and
davies
was
indeed
on
his
mettle
for
this
his
first
dinner
to
his
guest
for
he
produced
with
stealthy
pride
not
from
the
dishonoured
grave
of
the
beer
but
from
some
more
hallowed
recess
a
bottle
of
german
champagne
from
which
we
drank
success
to
the
wish
you
would
tell
me
all
about
your
cruise
from
england
i
asked
must
have
had
some
exciting
adventures
here
are
the
charts
let
go
over
them
must
wash
up
first
he
replied
and
i
was
tactfully
introduced
to
one
of
his
very
few
orders
that
tobacco
should
not
burn
nor
chat
begin
until
that
distasteful
process
had
ended
would
never
get
done
otherwise
he
sagely
opined
but
when
we
were
finally
settled
with
cigars
a
variety
of
which
culled
from
many
ports
german
dutch
and
belgian
davies
kept
in
a
battered
old
box
in
the
the
promised
talk
hung
fire
no
good
at
description
he
complained
there
really
very
little
to
tell
we
left
dover
morrison
and
i
on
the
of
august
made
a
good
passage
to
ostend
had
some
fun
there
i
suppose
i
put
in
thinking
of
well
of
ostend
in
august
a
filthy
hole
i
call
it
we
had
to
stop
a
couple
of
days
as
we
fouled
a
buoy
coming
in
and
carried
away
the
bobstay
we
lay
in
a
dirty
little
tidal
dock
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
on
shore
what
next
had
a
splendid
sail
to
the
east
scheldt
but
then
like
fools
decided
to
go
through
holland
by
canal
and
river
it
was
good
fun
enough
navigating
the
estuary
the
tides
and
banks
there
are
appalling
but
farther
inland
it
was
a
wretched
business
nothing
but
paying
bumping
against
schuyts
and
towing
down
stinking
canals
never
a
peaceful
night
like
this
always
moored
by
some
quay
or
with
people
passing
and
boys
heavens
shall
i
ever
forget
those
boys
a
perfect
murrain
of
them
infests
holland
they
seem
to
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
but
throw
stones
and
mud
at
foreign
yachts
want
a
herod
with
some
statesmanlike
views
on
infanticide
jove
yes
but
the
fact
is
that
you
want
a
crew
for
that
pottering
inland
work
they
can
smack
the
boys
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
sculls
a
boat
like
this
should
stick
to
the
sea
or
places
on
the
coast
well
after
amsterdam
skipped
a
good
deal
have
you
i
interrupted
have
i
well
let
me
see
we
went
by
dordrecht
to
rotterdam
nothing
to
see
there
and
swarms
of
tugs
buzzing
about
and
shaving
one
bows
every
second
on
by
the
vecht
river
to
amsterdam
and
thence
lord
what
a
relief
it
was
out
into
the
north
sea
again
the
weather
had
been
still
and
steamy
but
it
broke
up
finely
now
and
we
had
a
rattling
sail
to
the
zuyder
zee
he
reached
up
to
the
bookshelf
for
what
looked
like
an
ancient
ledger
and
turned
over
the
leaves
that
your
log
i
asked
should
like
to
have
a
look
at
it
you
find
it
dull
reading
if
you
could
read
it
at
all
just
short
notes
about
winds
and
bearings
and
so
on
he
was
turning
some
leaves
over
rapidly
why
do
you
keep
a
log
of
what
we
do
i
ca
describe
things
and
you
can
half
a
mind
to
try
i
said
want
another
chart
now
and
he
pulled
down
a
second
yet
more
stained
and
frayed
than
the
first
had
a
splendid
time
then
exploring
the
zuyder
zee
its
northern
part
at
least
and
round
those
islands
which
bound
it
on
the
north
those
are
the
frisian
islands
and
they
stretch
for
miles
or
so
eastward
you
see
the
first
two
of
them
texel
and
vlieland
shut
in
the
zuyder
zee
and
the
rest
border
the
dutch
and
german
coasts
see
map
a
all
this
i
said
running
my
finger
over
some
dotted
patches
which
covered
much
of
the
chart
the
latter
was
becoming
unintelligible
coasts
and
neat
regiments
of
little
figures
had
given
place
to
a
confusion
of
winding
and
intersecting
lines
and
bald
spaces
said
davies
enthusiastically
ca
think
what
a
splendid
it
is
you
can
explore
for
days
without
seeing
a
soul
these
are
the
channels
you
see
they
very
badly
charted
this
chart
was
almost
useless
but
it
made
it
all
the
more
fun
no
towns
or
harbours
just
a
village
or
two
on
the
islands
if
you
wanted
stores
look
rather
desolate
i
said
no
word
for
it
they
really
only
gigantic
sandbanks
themselves
all
this
rather
dangerous
i
asked
a
bit
you
see
that
where
our
shallow
draught
and
flat
bottom
came
in
we
could
go
anywhere
and
it
did
matter
running
aground
she
perfect
for
that
sort
of
work
and
she
does
really
bad
either
does
she
he
asked
rather
wistfully
i
suppose
i
hesitated
for
he
said
abruptly
i
do
go
in
for
looks
he
had
leaned
back
and
i
detected
traces
of
incipient
absentmindedness
his
cigar
which
he
had
lately
been
lighting
and
relighting
feverishly
a
habit
of
his
when
excited
seemed
now
to
have
expired
for
good
running
aground
i
persisted
that
apt
to
be
dangerous
he
sat
up
and
felt
round
for
a
match
the
least
if
you
know
where
you
can
run
risks
and
where
you
ca
anyway
you
ca
possibly
help
it
that
chart
may
look
simple
to
you
i
thought
at
half
flood
all
those
banks
are
covered
the
islands
and
coasts
are
scarcely
visible
they
are
so
low
and
everything
looks
the
same
this
graphic
description
of
a
took
away
my
breath
course
there
risk
sometimes
choosing
an
anchorage
requires
care
you
can
generally
get
a
nice
berth
under
the
lee
of
a
bank
but
the
tides
run
strong
in
the
channels
and
if
there
a
gale
blowing
you
ever
take
a
pilot
i
interrupted
why
the
whole
point
of
the
thing
he
stopped
short
did
take
one
once
later
on
he
resumed
with
an
odd
smile
which
faded
at
once
i
urged
for
i
saw
a
reverie
was
coming
he
ran
me
ashore
of
course
served
me
right
i
wonder
what
the
weather
doing
he
rose
glanced
at
the
aneroid
the
clock
and
the
skylight
with
a
curious
circular
movement
and
went
a
step
or
two
up
the
where
he
remained
for
several
minutes
with
head
and
shoulders
in
the
open
air
there
was
no
sound
of
wind
outside
but
the
had
begun
to
move
in
her
sleep
as
it
were
rolling
drowsily
to
some
faint
send
of
the
sea
with
an
occasional
short
jump
like
the
start
of
an
uneasy
dreamer
does
it
look
like
i
called
from
my
sofa
i
had
to
repeat
the
question
coming
said
davies
returning
possibly
wind
but
safe
enough
here
it
coming
from
the
shall
we
turn
in
have
finished
your
cruise
yet
i
said
a
pipe
and
tell
me
the
rest
right
he
agreed
with
more
readiness
than
i
expected
terschelling
here
it
is
the
third
island
from
the
west
i
pottered
along
eastward
see
map
a
i
forgot
morrison
had
to
leave
me
there
i
missed
him
badly
but
i
hoped
at
that
time
to
get
to
join
me
i
could
manage
all
right
but
for
that
sort
of
work
two
are
much
better
than
one
the
plate
beastly
heavy
in
fact
i
had
to
give
up
using
it
for
fear
of
a
smash
terschelling
i
jogged
his
memory
i
followed
the
dutch
islands
ameland
schiermonnikoog
rottum
outlandish
names
are
they
sometimes
outside
them
sometimes
inside
it
was
a
bit
lonely
but
grand
sport
and
very
interesting
the
charts
were
shocking
but
i
worried
out
most
of
the
channels
suppose
those
waters
are
only
used
by
small
local
craft
i
put
in
would
account
for
inaccuracies
did
davies
think
that
admiralties
had
time
to
waste
on
smoothing
the
road
for
such
quixotic
little
craft
as
his
in
all
its
inquisitive
ramblings
but
he
fired
up
all
very
well
he
said
think
what
folly
it
is
however
that
a
long
story
and
will
bore
you
to
cut
matters
short
for
we
ought
to
be
turning
in
i
got
to
borkum
that
the
first
of
the
islands
he
pointed
at
a
round
bare
lozenge
lying
in
the
midst
of
a
welter
of
sandbanks
this
queer
little
one
it
has
only
one
house
on
it
is
the
most
easterly
dutch
island
and
the
mainland
of
holland
ends
opposite
it
at
the
ems
river
indicating
a
dismal
cavity
in
the
coast
sown
with
names
suggestive
of
mud
and
wrecks
and
dreariness
date
was
this
i
asked
the
ninth
of
this
month
that
only
a
fortnight
before
you
wired
to
me
you
were
pretty
quick
getting
to
flensburg
wait
a
bit
we
want
another
chart
is
this
the
next
but
we
scarcely
need
it
i
only
went
a
little
way
farther
on
to
norderney
in
fact
the
third
german
island
then
i
decided
to
go
straight
for
the
baltic
i
had
always
had
an
idea
of
getting
there
as
knight
did
in
the
so
i
made
a
passage
of
it
to
the
eider
river
on
the
west
schleswig
coast
took
the
river
and
canal
through
to
kiel
on
the
baltic
and
from
there
made
another
passage
up
north
to
flensburg
i
was
a
week
there
and
then
you
came
and
here
we
are
and
now
let
turn
in
we
have
a
fine
sail
he
ended
with
rather
forced
vivacity
and
briskly
rolled
up
the
chart
the
reluctance
he
had
shown
from
the
first
to
talk
about
his
cruise
had
been
for
a
brief
space
forgotten
in
his
enthusiasm
about
a
portion
of
it
but
had
returned
markedly
in
this
bald
conclusion
i
felt
sure
that
there
was
more
in
it
than
mere
disinclination
to
spin
nautical
yarns
in
the
style
which
can
be
so
offensive
in
amateur
yachtsmen
and
i
thought
i
guessed
the
explanation
his
voyage
to
the
baltic
from
the
frisian
islands
had
been
a
foolhardy
enterprise
with
perilous
incidents
which
rather
than
make
light
of
he
would
not
refer
to
at
all
probably
he
was
ashamed
of
his
recklessness
and
wished
to
ignore
it
with
me
an
inexperienced
acquaintance
not
yet
enamoured
of
the
way
of
life
whom
both
courtesy
and
interest
demanded
that
he
should
inspire
with
confidence
i
liked
him
all
the
better
as
i
came
to
this
conclusion
but
i
was
tempted
to
persist
a
little
slept
the
whole
afternoon
i
said
to
tell
the
truth
i
rather
dread
the
idea
of
going
to
bed
it
so
tiring
look
here
you
rushed
over
that
last
part
like
an
express
train
that
passage
to
the
schleswig
coast
the
eider
river
did
you
say
was
a
longish
one
was
it
you
see
what
it
was
about
seventy
miles
i
suppose
direct
he
spoke
low
bending
down
to
sweep
up
some
cigar
ashes
on
the
floor
i
insinuated
you
put
in
somewhere
stopped
once
anchored
for
the
night
oh
that
nothing
of
a
sail
with
a
fair
wind
by
jove
i
forgotten
to
caulk
that
seam
over
your
bunk
and
it
going
to
rain
i
must
do
it
now
you
turn
in
he
disappeared
my
curiosity
never
very
consuming
was
banished
by
concern
as
to
the
open
seam
for
the
prospect
of
a
big
drop
remorseless
and
regular
as
fate
falling
on
my
forehead
throughout
the
night
as
in
the
of
the
inquisition
was
alarming
enough
to
recall
me
wholly
to
the
immediate
future
so
i
went
to
bed
finding
on
the
whole
that
i
had
made
progress
in
the
exercise
though
still
far
from
being
the
trained
contortionist
that
the
occasion
called
for
hammering
ceased
and
davies
reappeared
just
as
i
was
stretched
on
the
rack
tucked
up
in
my
bunk
i
mean
say
he
said
when
he
was
settled
in
his
and
darkness
reigned
you
think
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
there
are
many
places
about
here
as
beautiful
as
this
i
replied
think
i
shall
but
i
should
like
to
land
now
and
then
and
have
a
walk
of
course
a
great
deal
depends
on
the
weather
it
i
hope
this
rain
drops
had
begun
to
patter
overhead
mean
that
the
summer
over
for
good
you
can
sail
just
the
same
said
davies
it
very
bad
there
plenty
of
sheltered
water
there
bound
to
be
a
change
soon
but
then
there
are
the
ducks
the
colder
and
stormier
it
is
the
better
for
them
i
had
forgotten
the
ducks
and
the
cold
and
suddenly
presented
as
a
in
inclement
weather
the
lost
ground
in
my
estimation
which
she
had
latterly
gained
fond
of
shooting
i
said
i
afraid
i
only
a
yachtsman
and
i
should
much
prefer
sun
and
scenery
he
repeated
reflectively
say
you
must
have
thought
it
a
queer
taste
of
mine
to
cruise
about
on
that
outlandish
frisian
coast
how
would
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
should
loathe
it
i
answered
promptly
with
a
clear
conscience
you
delighted
yourself
to
get
to
the
baltic
it
must
be
a
wonderful
contrast
to
what
you
described
did
you
ever
see
another
yacht
there
one
he
answered
night
night
wanted
a
north
wind
nothing
disturbed
my
rest
that
night
so
adaptable
is
youth
and
so
masterful
is
nature
at
times
i
was
remotely
aware
of
a
threshing
of
rain
and
a
humming
of
wind
with
a
nervous
kicking
of
the
little
hull
and
at
one
moment
i
dreamt
i
saw
an
apparition
by
of
davies
clad
in
pyjamas
and
huge
grasping
a
misty
lantern
of
gigantic
proportions
but
the
apparition
mounted
the
ladder
and
disappeared
and
i
passed
to
other
dreams
a
blast
in
my
ear
like
the
voice
of
fifty
trombones
galvanized
me
into
full
consciousness
the
musician
smiling
and
tousled
was
at
my
bedside
raising
a
foghorn
to
his
lips
with
deadly
intention
a
way
we
have
in
the
he
said
as
i
started
up
on
one
elbow
did
startle
you
much
did
i
he
added
i
like
the
better
than
the
cold
douche
i
answered
thinking
of
yesterday
day
and
magnificent
breeze
he
answered
my
sensations
this
morning
were
vastly
livelier
than
those
of
yesterday
at
the
same
hour
my
limbs
were
supple
again
and
my
head
clear
not
even
the
searching
wind
could
mar
the
ecstasy
of
that
plunge
down
to
smooth
seductive
sand
where
i
buried
greedy
fingers
and
looked
through
a
medium
blue
with
that
translucent
blue
and
that
you
see
in
perfection
only
in
the
heart
of
ice
up
again
to
sun
wind
and
the
forest
whispers
from
the
shore
down
just
once
more
to
see
the
uncouth
anchor
stabbing
the
sand
soft
bosom
with
one
rusty
fang
deaf
and
inert
to
the
puny
efforts
to
drag
him
from
his
prey
back
holding
by
the
cable
as
a
rusty
clue
from
heaven
to
earth
up
to
that
little
maiden
bows
back
to
breakfast
with
an
appetite
not
to
be
blunted
by
condensed
milk
and
somewhat
bread
an
hour
later
we
had
dressed
the
for
the
road
and
were
foaming
into
the
grey
void
of
yesterday
now
a
noble
expanse
of
blue
half
surrounded
by
distant
hills
their
every
outline
vivid
in
the
air
i
can
not
pretend
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
first
sail
into
the
open
though
i
was
keenly
anxious
to
do
so
i
felt
the
thrill
of
those
forward
leaps
heard
that
persuasive
song
the
foam
sings
under
the
saw
the
flashing
harmonies
of
sea
and
sky
but
sensuous
perception
was
deadened
by
nervousness
the
yacht
looked
smaller
than
ever
outside
the
quiet
fiord
the
song
of
the
foam
seemed
very
near
the
wave
crests
aft
very
high
the
novice
in
sailing
clings
desperately
to
the
thoughts
of
sailors
effective
prudent
persons
with
a
typical
jargon
and
a
typical
dress
versed
in
local
currents
and
winds
i
could
not
help
missing
this
professional
element
davies
as
he
sat
grasping
his
beloved
tiller
looked
strikingly
efficient
in
his
way
and
supremely
at
home
in
his
surroundings
but
he
looked
the
amateur
through
and
through
as
with
one
hand
and
it
seemed
one
eye
he
wrestled
with
a
chart
half
unrolled
on
the
deck
beside
him
all
his
casual
ways
returned
to
me
his
casual
talk
and
that
last
adventurous
voyage
to
the
baltic
and
the
suspicions
his
reticence
had
aroused
you
see
a
monument
anywhere
he
said
all
at
once
and
before
i
could
answer
must
take
another
reef
he
let
go
of
the
tiller
and
relit
his
pipe
while
the
yacht
rounded
sharply
to
and
in
a
twinkling
was
tossing
head
to
sea
with
loud
claps
of
her
canvas
and
passionate
jerks
of
her
boom
as
the
wind
leapt
on
its
quarry
now
turning
to
bay
with
redoubled
force
the
sting
of
spray
in
my
eyes
and
the
babel
of
noise
dazed
me
but
davies
with
a
pull
on
the
soothed
the
tormented
little
ship
and
left
her
coolly
sparring
with
the
waves
while
he
shortened
sail
and
puffed
his
pipe
an
hour
later
the
narrow
vista
of
als
sound
was
visible
with
quiet
old
sonderburg
sunning
itself
on
the
island
shore
and
the
dybbol
heights
towering
above
the
dybbol
of
bloody
memory
scene
of
the
last
desperate
stand
of
the
danes
in
ere
the
prussians
wrested
the
two
fair
provinces
from
them
early
to
anchor
and
i
hate
towns
said
davies
as
one
section
of
a
lumbering
pontoon
bridge
opened
to
give
us
passage
but
i
was
firm
on
the
need
for
a
walk
and
got
my
way
on
condition
that
i
bought
stores
as
well
and
returned
in
time
to
admit
of
further
advance
to
a
anchorage
never
did
i
step
on
the
solid
earth
with
stranger
feelings
partly
due
to
relief
from
confinement
partly
to
that
sense
of
independence
in
travelling
which
for
those
who
go
down
to
the
sea
in
small
ships
can
make
the
foulest
in
northumbria
seem
attractive
and
here
i
had
fascinating
sonderburg
with
its
houses
of
carved
woodwork
each
fresh
with
cleansing
yet
reverend
with
age
its
men
and
rosy
women
with
their
bullet
foreheads
and
large
mouths
sonderburg
still
danish
to
the
core
under
its
teuton
veneer
crossing
the
bridge
i
climbed
the
dybbol
dotted
with
memorials
of
that
heroic
defence
and
thence
could
see
the
wee
form
and
gossamer
rigging
of
the
on
the
silver
ribbon
of
the
sound
and
was
reminded
by
the
sight
that
there
were
stores
to
be
bought
so
i
hurried
down
again
to
the
old
quarter
and
bargained
over
eggs
and
bread
with
a
dear
old
lady
pink
as
a
made
a
patriotic
pretence
of
not
understanding
german
and
called
in
her
strapping
son
whose
few
words
of
english
being
chiefly
nautical
slang
picked
up
on
a
british
trawler
were
peculiarly
useless
for
the
purpose
davies
had
tea
ready
when
i
came
aboard
again
and
drinking
it
on
deck
we
proceeded
up
the
sheltered
sound
which
in
spite
of
its
imposing
name
was
no
bigger
than
an
inland
river
only
the
hosts
of
rainbow
reminding
us
that
we
were
threading
a
highway
of
ocean
there
is
no
rise
and
fall
of
tide
in
these
regions
to
disfigure
the
shore
with
mud
here
was
a
shelving
gravel
bank
there
a
bed
of
whispering
rushes
there
again
young
birch
trees
growing
to
the
very
brink
each
wearing
a
stocking
of
bright
moss
and
setting
its
foot
firmly
in
among
golden
leaves
and
scarlet
fungus
davies
was
preoccupied
but
he
lighted
up
when
i
talked
of
the
danish
war
a
thundering
great
nation
he
said
wonder
if
we
shall
ever
fight
her
a
little
incident
that
happened
after
we
anchored
deepened
the
impression
left
by
this
conversation
we
crept
at
dusk
into
a
shaded
where
our
keel
almost
touched
the
gravel
bed
opposite
us
on
the
alsen
shore
there
showed
against
the
sky
the
spire
of
a
little
monument
rising
from
a
leafy
hollow
wonder
what
that
is
i
said
it
was
scarcely
a
minute
row
in
the
dinghy
and
when
the
anchor
was
down
we
sculled
over
to
it
a
bank
of
loam
led
to
gorse
and
bramble
pushing
aside
some
branches
we
came
to
a
slender
gothic
memorial
in
grey
stone
inscribed
with
of
battle
scenes
showing
prussians
forcing
a
landing
in
boats
and
danes
resisting
with
savage
tenacity
in
the
failing
light
we
spelt
out
an
inscription
bei
dem
meeres
uebergange
und
der
eroberung
von
alsen
am
juni
heldenm√ºthig
gefallenen
zum
ehrenden
ged√§chtniss
the
honoured
memory
of
those
who
died
heroically
at
the
invasion
and
storming
of
alsen
i
knew
the
german
passion
for
commemoration
i
had
seen
similar
memorials
on
alsatian
battlefields
and
several
on
the
dybbol
only
that
afternoon
but
there
was
something
in
the
scene
the
hour
and
the
circumstances
which
made
this
one
seem
singularly
touching
as
for
davies
i
scarcely
recognized
him
his
eyes
flashed
and
filled
with
tears
as
he
glanced
from
the
inscription
to
the
path
we
had
followed
and
the
water
beyond
was
a
landing
in
boats
i
suppose
he
said
half
to
himself
wonder
they
managed
it
what
does
mean
gefallenen
he
repeated
under
his
breath
lingering
on
each
syllable
he
was
like
a
schoolboy
reading
of
waterloo
our
conversation
at
dinner
turned
naturally
on
war
and
in
naval
warfare
i
found
i
had
come
upon
davies
literary
hobby
i
had
not
hitherto
paid
attention
to
the
medley
on
our
bookshelf
but
i
now
saw
that
besides
a
nautical
almanack
and
some
dilapidated
there
were
several
books
on
the
cruises
of
small
yachts
and
also
some
big
volumes
crushed
in
anyhow
or
lying
on
the
top
squinting
painfully
at
them
i
saw
mahan
of
and
others
a
tremendously
interesting
subject
said
davies
pulling
down
in
two
pieces
a
volume
of
mahan
of
sea
dinner
flagged
and
froze
while
he
illustrated
a
point
by
reference
to
the
pages
he
was
very
keen
and
not
very
articulate
i
knew
just
enough
to
be
an
intelligent
listener
and
though
hungry
was
delighted
to
hear
him
talk
not
boring
you
am
i
he
said
suddenly
should
think
not
i
protested
you
might
just
have
a
look
at
the
chops
they
had
indeed
been
crying
aloud
for
notice
for
some
minutes
and
drew
candid
attention
to
their
neglect
when
they
appeared
the
diversion
they
caused
put
davies
out
of
vein
i
tried
to
revive
the
subject
but
he
was
reserved
and
diffident
the
untidy
bookshelf
reminded
me
of
the
logbook
and
when
davies
had
retired
with
the
crockery
to
the
forecastle
i
pulled
the
ledger
down
and
turned
over
the
leaves
it
was
a
mass
of
short
entries
with
cryptic
abbreviations
winds
tides
weather
and
courses
appearing
to
predominate
the
voyage
from
dover
to
ostend
was
dismissed
in
two
lines
way
wind
moderate
west
hinder
outside
all
banks
ostend
the
scheldt
had
a
couple
of
pages
very
technical
and
in
style
inland
holland
was
given
a
contemptuous
summary
with
some
allusions
to
windmills
and
so
on
and
a
caustic
word
or
two
about
boys
paint
and
canal
smells
at
amsterdam
technicalities
began
again
and
a
brisker
tone
pervaded
the
entries
which
became
progressively
fuller
as
the
writer
cruised
on
the
frisian
coast
he
was
clearly
in
better
spirits
for
here
and
there
were
quaint
and
laboured
efforts
to
describe
nature
out
of
material
which
as
far
as
i
could
judge
was
repellent
enough
to
discourage
the
most
brilliant
and
observant
of
writers
with
an
occasional
note
of
a
visit
on
shore
generally
reached
by
a
walk
of
half
a
mile
over
sand
and
of
talks
with
shop
people
and
fishermen
but
such
lighter
relief
was
rare
the
bulk
dealt
with
channels
and
shoals
with
weird
and
depressing
names
with
the
the
sails
and
the
wind
buoys
and
tides
and
for
the
night
off
appeared
to
be
a
frequent
diversion
aground
was
of
almost
daily
occurrence
it
was
not
easy
reading
and
i
turned
the
leaves
rapidly
i
was
curious
too
to
see
the
latter
part
i
came
to
a
point
where
the
rain
of
little
sentences
pattering
out
like
small
shot
ceased
abruptly
it
was
at
the
end
of
september
that
day
with
its
and
was
filled
in
with
the
usual
detail
the
log
then
leapt
over
three
days
and
went
on
wind
fresh
decided
to
go
to
baltic
sailed
quick
passage
to

this
recital
of
naked
facts
was
quite
characteristic
when
were
concerned
and
any
curiosity
i
had
felt
about
his
reticence
on
the
previous
night
would
have
been
rather
allayed
than
stimulated
had
i
not
noticed
that
a
page
had
been
torn
out
of
the
book
just
at
this
point
the
frayed
edge
left
had
been
pruned
and
picked
into
very
small
limits
but
dissimulation
was
not
davies
strong
point
and
a
child
could
have
seen
that
a
leaf
was
missing
and
that
the
entries
starting
from
the
evening
of
september
where
a
page
ended
had
been
written
together
at
one
sitting
i
was
on
the
point
of
calling
to
davies
and
chaffing
him
with
having
committed
a
grave
offence
against
maritime
law
in
having
his
log
but
i
checked
myself
i
scarcely
know
why
probably
because
i
guessed
the
joke
would
touch
a
sensitive
place
and
fail
delicacy
shrank
from
seeing
him
compelled
either
to
amplify
a
deception
or
blunder
out
a
confession
he
was
too
easy
a
prey
and
after
all
the
matter
was
of
small
moment
i
returned
the
book
to
the
shelf
the
only
definite
result
of
its
perusal
being
to
recall
my
promise
to
keep
a
diary
myself
and
i
then
and
there
dedicated
a
notebook
to
the
purpose
we
were
just
lighting
our
cigars
when
we
heard
voices
and
the
splash
of
oars
followed
by
a
bump
against
the
hull
which
made
davies
wince
as
violations
of
his
paint
always
did
abend
wo
fahren
sie
hin
greeted
us
as
we
climbed
on
deck
it
turned
out
to
be
some
jovial
fishermen
returning
to
their
smack
from
a
visit
to
sonderburg
a
short
dialogue
proved
to
them
that
we
were
mad
englishmen
in
bitter
need
of
charity
to
satrup
they
said
the
smacks
are
there
round
the
point
there
is
good
punch
in
the
inn
nothing
loth
we
followed
in
the
dinghy
skirted
a
bend
of
the
sound
and
opened
up
the
lights
of
a
village
with
some
smacks
at
anchor
in
front
of
it
we
were
escorted
to
the
inn
and
introduced
to
a
formidable
beverage
called
and
a
circle
of
smacksmen
who
talked
german
out
of
courtesy
but
were
danish
in
all
else
davies
was
at
once
at
home
with
them
to
a
degree
indeed
that
i
envied
his
german
was
of
the
crudest
kind
in
vocabulary
and
comical
in
accent
but
the
freemasonry
of
the
sea
or
some
charm
of
his
own
gave
intuition
to
both
him
and
his
hearers
i
cut
a
poor
figure
in
this
nautical
gathering
though
davies
who
persistently
referred
to
me
as
freund
tried
hard
to
represent
me
as
a
kindred
spirit
and
to
include
me
in
the
general
talk
i
was
detected
at
once
as
an
uninteresting
hybrid
davies
who
sometimes
appealed
to
me
for
a
word
was
deep
in
talk
over
anchorages
and
ducks
especially
as
i
well
remember
now
about
the
chance
of
sport
in
a
certain
i
fell
into
utter
neglect
till
rescued
by
a
taciturn
person
in
spectacles
and
a
very
high
cap
who
appeared
to
be
the
only
landsman
present
after
silently
puffing
smoke
in
my
direction
for
some
time
he
asked
me
if
i
was
married
and
if
not
when
i
proposed
to
be
after
this
inquisition
he
abandoned
me
it
was
eleven
before
we
left
this
hospitable
inn
escorted
by
the
whole
party
to
the
dinghy
our
friends
of
the
smack
insisted
on
our
sharing
their
boat
out
of
pure
for
there
was
not
nearly
room
for
us
and
would
not
let
us
go
till
a
bucket
of
fish
had
been
emptied
into
her
bottom
after
much
shaking
of
scaly
hands
we
sculled
back
to
the
where
she
slept
in
a
bed
of
tremulous
stars
davies
sniffed
the
wind
and
scanned
the
where
light
gusts
were
toying
with
the
leaves
still
he
said
more
rain
coming
but
it
bound
to
shift
into
the
north
that
be
a
good
wind
for
us
depends
where
we
go
he
said
slowly
was
asking
those
fellows
about
they
seemed
to
think
the
best
place
would
be
schlei
fiord
that
about
fifteen
miles
south
of
sonderburg
on
the
way
to
kiel
they
said
there
was
a
pilot
chap
living
at
the
mouth
who
would
tell
us
all
about
it
they
were
very
encouraging
though
we
should
want
a
north
wind
for
that
do
care
where
we
go
i
said
to
my
own
surprise
you
really
he
rejoined
with
sudden
warmth
then
with
a
slight
change
of
voice
mean
it
all
very
jolly
about
here
of
course
i
meant
that
before
we
went
below
we
both
looked
for
a
moment
at
the
little
grey
memorial
its
slender
fretted
arch
outlined
in
tender
lights
and
darks
above
the
hollow
on
the
alsen
shore
the
night
was
that
of
september
the
third
i
had
spent
on
the
vi
schlei
fiord
i
make
no
apology
for
having
described
these
early
days
in
some
detail
it
is
no
wonder
that
their
trivialities
are
as
vividly
before
me
as
the
colours
of
earth
and
sea
in
this
enchanting
corner
of
the
world
for
every
trifle
sordid
or
picturesque
was
relevant
every
scrap
of
talk
a
link
every
passing
mood
critical
for
good
or
ill
so
slight
indeed
were
the
determining
causes
that
changed
my
autumn
holiday
into
an
undertaking
the
most
momentous
i
have
ever
approached
two
days
more
preceded
the
change
on
the
first
the
southwesterly
wind
still
holding
we
sallied
forth
into
augustenburg
fiord
practise
smartness
in
a
heavy
thresh
as
davies
put
it
it
was
the
day
of
dedication
for
those
disgusting
oilskins
immured
in
whose
stiff
and
odorous
angles
i
felt
distressfully
cumbersome
a
day
of
proof
indeed
for
me
for
heavy
squalls
swept
incessantly
over
the
loch
and
davies
at
my
own
request
gave
me
no
rest
backwards
and
forwards
we
tacked
blustering
into
coves
and
out
again
reefing
and
unreefing
now
stung
with
rain
now
warmed
with
sun
but
never
with
time
to
breathe
or
think
i
wrestled
with
intractable
ropes
slaves
if
they
could
be
subdued
tyrants
if
they
got
the
upper
hand
creeping
craning
straining
i
made
the
painful
round
of
the
deck
while
davies
hatless
and
tranquil
directed
my
blundering
movements
take
the
helm
and
try
steering
in
a
hard
breeze
to
windward
it
the
finest
sport
on
earth
so
i
grappled
with
the
niceties
of
that
delicate
craft
smarting
eyes
chafed
hands
and
dazed
brain
all
pressed
into
the
service
whilst
davies
taming
the
ropes
the
while
shouted
into
my
ear
the
subtle
mysteries
of
the
art
that
fidgeting
ripple
in
the
luff
of
the
mainsail
and
the
distant
rattle
from
the
hungry
jib
signs
that
they
are
starved
of
wind
and
must
be
given
more
the
heavy
list
and
wallow
of
the
hull
the
feel
of
the
wind
on
your
cheek
instead
of
your
nose
the
broader
angle
of
the
burgee
at
the
masthead
signs
that
they
have
too
much
and
that
she
is
sagging
recreantly
to
leeward
instead
of
fighting
to
windward
he
taught
me
the
tactics
for
meeting
squalls
and
the
way
to
press
your
advantage
when
they
are
defeated
the
iron
hand
in
the
velvet
glove
that
the
wilful
tiller
needs
if
you
are
to
gain
your
ends
with
it
the
exact
set
of
the
sheets
necessary
to
get
the
easiest
and
swiftest
play
of
the
hull
all
these
things
and
many
more
i
struggled
to
apprehend
careless
for
the
moment
as
to
whether
they
were
worth
knowing
but
doggedly
set
on
knowing
them
needless
to
say
i
had
no
eyes
for
beauty
the
wooded
inlets
we
dived
into
gave
a
brief
respite
from
wind
and
spindrift
but
called
into
use
the
lead
and
the
centreboard
tackle
two
new
and
cumbrous
complexities
davies
passion
for
intricate
navigation
had
to
be
sated
even
in
these
secure
and
tideless
waters
get
in
as
near
as
we
can
you
stand
by
the
lead
was
his
formula
so
i
made
false
casts
tripped
up
in
the
slack
sent
rivers
of
water
up
my
sleeves
and
committed
all
the
other
that
beginners
in
the
art
commit
while
the
sand
showed
whiter
beneath
the
keel
till
davies
regretfully
drew
off
and
shouted
about
down
and
i
dashed
down
to
the
trappings
of
that
diabolical
contrivance
the
only
part
of
the
equipment
that
i
hated
fiercely
to
the
last
it
had
an
odious
habit
when
lowered
of
spouting
jets
of
water
through
its
on
to
the
cabin
floor
one
of
my
duties
was
to
gag
it
with
but
even
then
its
choking
gurgle
was
a
most
uncomfortable
sound
in
your
in
a
minute
the
creek
would
be
behind
us
and
we
would
be
thumping
our
stem
into
the
short
hollow
waves
of
the
fiord
and
lurching
through
spray
and
rain
for
some
point
on
the
opposite
shore
of
our
destination
and
objects
if
we
had
any
i
knew
nothing
at
the
northern
end
of
the
fiord
just
before
we
turned
davies
had
turned
dreamy
in
the
most
exasperating
way
for
i
was
steering
at
the
time
and
in
mortal
need
of
sympathetic
guidance
if
i
was
to
avoid
a
sudden
jibe
as
though
continuing
aloud
some
internal
debate
he
held
a
onesided
argument
to
the
effect
that
it
was
no
use
going
farther
north
ducks
weather
and
charts
figured
in
it
but
i
did
not
follow
the
pros
and
cons
i
only
know
that
we
suddenly
turned
and
began
to
south
again
at
sunset
we
were
back
once
more
in
the
same
quiet
pool
among
the
trees
and
fields
of
als
sound
a
wondrous
peace
succeeding
the
turmoil
bruised
and
sodden
i
was
extricating
myself
from
my
oily
prison
and
later
was
tasting
though
not
nearly
yet
in
its
perfection
the
unique
exultation
that
follows
such
a
day
when
glowing
all
over
deliciously
tired
and
pleasantly
sore
you
eat
what
seems
ambrosia
be
it
only
tinned
beef
and
drink
nectar
be
it
only
distilled
from
terrestrial
hops
or
coffee
berries
and
inhale
as
culminating
luxury
balmy
fumes
which
even
the
happy
homeric
gods
knew
naught
of
on
the
following
morning
the
a
joyous
shout
of
wind
sent
me
shivering
on
deck
in
the
small
hours
to
handle
canvas
and
cutting
chain
it
was
a
cloudy
unsettled
day
but
still
enough
after
yesterday
boisterous
ordeal
we
retraced
our
way
past
sonderburg
and
thence
sailed
for
a
faint
line
of
pale
green
on
the
far
horizon
it
was
during
this
passage
that
an
incident
occurred
which
slight
as
it
was
opened
my
eyes
to
much
a
flight
of
wild
duck
crossed
our
bows
at
some
little
distance
a
phalanx
of
craning
necks
and
flapping
wings
i
happened
to
be
steering
while
davies
verified
our
course
below
but
i
called
him
up
at
once
and
a
discussion
began
about
our
chances
of
sport
davies
was
gloomy
over
them
fellows
at
satrup
were
rather
doubtful
he
said
are
plenty
of
ducks
but
i
made
out
that
it
not
easy
for
strangers
to
get
shooting
the
whole
country
so
very
civilized
it
not
enough
is
it
he
looked
at
me
i
had
no
very
clear
opinion
it
was
anything
but
wild
in
one
sense
but
there
seemed
to
be
wild
enough
spots
for
ducks
the
shore
we
were
passing
appeared
to
be
bordered
by
lonely
marshes
though
a
spacious
champaign
showed
behind
if
it
were
not
for
the
beautiful
places
we
had
seen
and
my
growing
taste
for
our
way
of
seeing
them
his
disappointing
vagueness
would
have
nettled
me
more
than
it
did
for
after
all
he
had
brought
me
out
loaded
with
sporting
equipment
under
a
promise
of
shooting
weather
is
what
we
want
for
ducks
he
said
i
afraid
we
in
the
wrong
place
for
them
now
if
it
was
the
north
sea
among
those
frisian
tslands
his
tone
was
timid
and
interrogative
and
i
felt
at
once
that
he
was
sounding
me
as
to
some
unpalatable
plan
whose
nature
began
to
dawn
on
me
he
stammered
on
through
a
sentence
or
two
about
and
to
interfere
with
you
and
then
i
broke
in
surely
do
want
to
leave
the
baltic
not
said
he
staring
into
the
compass
it
man
i
returned
tartly
we
are
in
october
the
summer
over
and
the
weather
gone
to
pieces
we
alone
in
a
boat
at
a
time
when
every
other
yacht
of
our
size
is
laying
up
for
the
winter
luckily
we
seem
to
have
struck
an
ideal
with
a
wide
choice
of
safe
fiords
and
a
good
prospect
of
ducks
if
we
choose
to
take
a
little
trouble
about
them
you
ca
mean
to
waste
time
and
run
risks
i
thought
of
the
torn
leaf
in
the
a
long
voyage
to
those
forbidding
haunts
of
yours
in
the
north
sea
not
very
long
said
davies
doggedly
of
it
canal
and
the
rest
is
quite
safe
if
you
careful
there
plenty
of
sheltered
water
and
it
not
really
necessary
it
all
i
interrupted
impatiently
have
for
shooting
here
yet
you
no
notion
have
you
of
getting
the
boat
back
to
england
this
autumn
he
muttered
i
do
much
care
again
his
vagueness
jarred
on
me
there
seemed
to
be
some
bar
between
us
invisible
and
insurmountable
and
after
all
what
was
i
doing
here
roughing
it
in
a
shabby
little
yacht
utterly
out
of
my
element
with
a
man
who
a
week
ago
was
nothing
to
me
and
who
now
was
a
tiresome
enigma
like
swift
poison
the
old
morbid
mood
in
which
i
left
london
spread
through
me
all
i
had
learnt
and
seen
slipped
away
what
i
had
suffered
remained
i
was
on
the
point
of
saying
something
which
might
have
put
a
precipitate
end
to
our
cruise
but
he
anticipated
me
awfully
sorry
he
broke
out
being
such
a
selfish
brute
i
do
know
what
i
was
thinking
about
you
a
brick
to
join
me
in
this
sort
of
life
and
i
afraid
i
an
infernally
bad
host
of
course
this
is
just
the
place
to
cruise
i
forgot
about
the
scenery
and
all
that
let
ask
about
the
ducks
here
as
you
say
we
sure
to
get
sport
if
we
worry
and
push
a
bit
we
must
be
nearly
there
now
yes
there
the
entrance
take
the
helm
will
you
he
sprang
up
the
mast
like
a
monkey
and
gazed
over
the
land
from
the
i
looked
up
at
my
enigma
and
thanked
providence
i
had
not
spoken
for
no
one
could
have
resisted
his
frank
outburst
of
good
nature
yet
it
occurred
to
me
that
considering
the
conditions
of
our
life
our
intimacy
was
strangely
slow
in
growth
i
had
no
clue
yet
as
to
where
his
idiosyncrasies
began
and
his
self
ended
and
he
i
surmised
was
in
the
same
stage
towards
me
otherwise
i
should
have
pressed
him
further
now
for
i
felt
convinced
that
there
was
some
mystery
in
his
behaviour
which
i
had
not
yet
accounted
for
however
light
was
soon
to
break
i
could
see
no
sign
of
the
entrance
he
had
spoken
of
and
no
wonder
for
it
is
only
eighty
yards
wide
though
it
leads
to
a
fiord
thirty
miles
long
all
at
once
we
were
jolting
in
a
tumble
of
sea
and
the
channel
grudgingly
disclosed
itself
stealing
between
marshes
and
meadows
and
then
broadening
to
a
mere
as
at
ekken
we
anchored
close
to
the
mouth
and
not
far
from
a
group
of
vessels
of
a
type
that
afterwards
grew
very
familiar
to
me
they
were
something
like
those
that
ply
in
the
thames
craft
of
about
fifty
tons
and
fitted
with
very
light
spars
and
a
long
bowsprit
for
the
future
i
shall
call
them
otherwise
the
only
sign
of
life
was
a
solitary
white
house
the
pilot
house
the
chart
told
us
close
to
the
northern
point
of
entrance
after
tea
we
called
on
the
pilot
patriarchally
installed
before
a
roaring
stove
in
the
company
of
a
buxom
bustling
and
some
rosy
grandchildren
we
found
a
rotund
and
rubicund
person
who
greeted
us
with
a
hoarse
roar
of
welcome
in
german
which
instantly
changed
when
he
saw
us
to
the
funniest
broken
english
spoken
with
intense
relish
and
pride
we
explained
ourselves
and
our
mission
as
well
as
we
could
through
the
hospitable
interruptions
caused
by
beer
and
the
strains
of
a
huge
musical
box
which
had
been
set
going
in
honour
of
our
arrival
needless
to
say
i
was
read
like
a
book
at
once
and
fell
into
the
part
of
listener
yes
he
said
right
there
is
plenty
ducks
but
first
we
will
drink
a
glass
beer
then
we
will
shift
your
ship
captain
she
lies
not
good
there
davies
started
up
in
a
panic
but
was
waved
back
to
his
beer
we
will
drink
together
another
glass
beer
then
we
will
talk
of
ducks
no
then
we
will
kill
ducks
that
is
better
then
we
will
have
plenty
glasses
beer
this
was
an
unexpected
climax
and
promised
well
for
our
prospects
and
the
programme
was
fully
carried
out
after
the
beer
our
host
was
packed
briskly
by
his
daughter
into
an
armour
of
woollen
gaiters
coats
and
mufflers
topped
with
a
worsted
helmet
which
left
nothing
of
his
face
visible
but
a
pair
of
twinkling
eyes
thus
equipped
he
led
the
way
out
of
doors
and
roared
for
hans
and
his
gun
till
a
great
gawky
youth
with
high
and
a
downy
beard
came
out
from
the
yard
and
sheepishly
shook
our
hands
together
we
repaired
to
the
quay
where
the
pilot
stood
looking
like
a
genial
ball
of
worsted
and
bawled
hoarse
directions
while
we
shifted
the
to
a
berth
on
the
farther
shore
close
to
the
other
vessels
we
returned
with
our
guns
and
the
interval
for
refreshments
followed
it
was
just
dusk
when
we
sallied
out
again
crossed
a
stretch
of
and
took
up
strategic
posts
round
a
stagnant
pond
hans
had
been
sent
to
drive
and
the
result
was
a
fine
mallard
and
three
ducks
it
was
true
that
all
fell
to
the
gun
perhaps
owing
to
hans
filial
instinct
and
his
parent
canny
egotism
in
choosing
his
own
lair
or
perhaps
it
was
chance
but
the
was
none
the
less
a
triumphal
success
it
was
celebrated
with
beer
and
music
as
before
while
the
pilot
an
infant
on
each
podgy
knee
discoursed
exuberantly
on
the
glories
of
his
country
and
the
elysian
content
of
his
life
is
plenty
beer
plenty
meat
plenty
money
plenty
ducks
summed
up
his
survey
it
may
have
been
fancy
but
davies
though
he
had
fits
and
starts
of
vivacity
seemed
very
inattentive
considering
that
we
were
sitting
at
the
feet
of
so
expansive
an
oracle
it
was
i
who
elicited
most
of
the
practical
information
details
of
time
weather
and
likely
places
for
shooting
with
some
shrewd
hints
as
to
the
kind
of
people
to
conciliate
whatever
he
thought
of
me
i
warmed
with
sympathy
towards
the
pilot
for
he
assumed
that
we
had
done
with
cruising
for
the
year
and
thought
us
mad
enough
as
it
was
to
have
been
afloat
so
long
and
madder
still
to
intend
living
on
little
a
ship
when
we
could
live
on
land
with
beer
and
music
handy
i
was
tempted
to
raise
the
north
sea
question
just
to
watch
davies
under
the
thunder
of
rebukes
which
would
follow
but
i
refrained
from
a
wish
to
be
tender
with
him
now
that
all
was
going
so
well
the
frisian
islands
were
an
extravagant
absurdity
now
i
did
not
even
refer
to
them
as
we
pulled
back
to
the
after
swearing
eternal
friendship
with
the
good
pilot
and
his
family
davies
and
i
turned
in
good
friends
that
night
or
rather
i
should
say
that
i
turned
in
for
i
left
him
sucking
an
empty
pipe
and
aimlessly
fingering
a
volume
of
mahan
and
once
when
i
woke
in
the
night
i
felt
somehow
that
his
bunk
was
empty
and
that
he
was
there
in
the
dark
cabin
dreaming
vii
the
missing
page
i
woke
on
the
of
october
with
that
dispiriting
sensation
that
a
hitch
has
occurred
in
a
settled
plan
it
was
explained
when
i
went
on
deck
and
i
found
the
wrapped
in
a
fog
silent
clammy
nothing
visible
from
her
decks
but
the
ghostly
hull
of
a
galliot
at
anchor
near
us
she
must
have
brought
up
there
in
the
night
for
there
had
been
nothing
so
close
the
evening
before
and
i
remembered
that
my
sleep
had
been
broken
once
by
sounds
of
rumbling
chain
and
gruff
voices
looks
pretty
hopeless
for
i
said
with
a
shiver
to
davies
who
was
laying
the
breakfast
we
ca
do
anything
till
this
fog
lifts
he
answered
with
a
good
deal
of
resignation
breakfast
was
a
cheerless
meal
the
damp
penetrated
to
the
very
cabin
whose
roof
and
walls
wept
a
fine
dew
i
had
dreaded
a
bathe
and
yet
missed
it
and
the
ghastly
light
made
the
tablecloth
look
dirtier
than
it
naturally
was
and
all
the
accessories
more
sordid
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
bacon
and
the
lack
of
was
not
in
the
least
humorous
davies
was
just
beginning
in
his
summary
way
to
tumble
the
things
together
for
washing
up
when
there
was
a
sound
of
a
step
on
deck
two
appeared
on
the
ladder
and
before
we
could
wonder
who
the
visitor
was
a
little
man
in
oilskins
and
a
was
stooping
towards
us
in
the
cabin
door
smiling
affectionately
at
davies
out
of
a
round
grizzled
beard
met
captain
he
said
quietly
in
german
are
you
bound
to
this
time
exclaimed
davies
jumping
up
the
two
stooping
figures
young
and
old
beamed
at
one
another
like
father
and
son
have
you
come
from
have
some
coffee
how
the
was
that
you
that
came
in
last
night
i
delighted
to
see
you
i
spare
the
reader
his
uncouth
lingo
the
little
man
was
dragged
in
and
seated
on
the
opposite
sofa
to
me
took
my
apples
to
kappeln
he
said
sedately
now
i
sail
to
kiel
and
so
to
hamburg
where
my
wife
and
children
are
it
is
my
last
voyage
of
the
year
you
are
no
longer
alone
captain
i
see
he
had
taken
off
his
dripping
and
was
bowing
ceremoniously
towards
me
i
quite
forgot
said
davies
who
had
been
kneeling
on
one
knee
in
the
low
doorway
absorbed
in
his
visitor
is
herr
carruthers
carruthers
this
is
my
friend
schiffer
bartels
of
the
galliot
was
i
never
to
be
at
an
end
of
the
puzzles
which
davies
presented
to
me
all
the
impulsive
heartiness
died
out
of
his
voice
and
manner
as
he
uttered
the
last
few
words
and
there
he
was
nervously
glancing
from
the
visitor
to
me
like
one
who
against
his
will
or
from
tactlessness
has
introduced
two
persons
who
he
knows
will
disagree
there
was
a
pause
while
he
fumbled
with
the
cups
poured
some
cold
coffee
out
and
pondered
over
it
as
though
it
were
a
chemical
experiment
then
he
muttered
something
about
boiling
some
more
water
and
took
refuge
in
the
forecastle
i
was
ill
at
ease
at
this
period
with
seafaring
men
but
this
mild
little
person
was
easy
ground
for
a
beginner
besides
when
he
took
off
his
oilskin
coat
he
reminded
me
less
of
a
sailor
than
of
a
homely
draper
of
some
country
town
with
his
clean
collar
and
neatly
fitting
frieze
jacket
we
exchanged
some
polite
platitudes
about
the
fog
and
his
voyage
last
night
from
kappeln
which
appeared
to
be
a
town
some
fifteen
miles
up
the
fiord
davies
joined
in
from
the
forecastle
with
an
excess
of
warmth
which
almost
took
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
we
exhausted
the
subject
very
soon
and
then
my
smiled
paternally
at
me
as
he
had
done
at
davies
and
said
confidentially
is
good
that
the
captain
is
no
more
alone
he
is
a
fine
young
man
heaven
what
a
fine
young
man
i
love
him
as
my
son
but
he
is
too
brave
too
reckless
it
is
good
for
him
to
have
a
friend
i
nodded
and
laughed
though
in
reality
i
was
very
far
from
being
amused
was
it
you
met
i
asked
an
ugly
place
and
in
ugly
weather
he
answered
gravely
but
with
a
twinkle
of
fun
in
his
eye
has
he
not
told
you
he
added
with
ponderous
slyness
came
just
in
time
no
what
am
i
saying
he
is
brave
as
a
lion
and
quick
as
a
cat
i
think
he
can
not
drown
but
still
it
was
an
ugly
place
and
ugly
are
you
talking
about
bartels
interrupted
davies
emerging
noisily
with
a
boiling
kettle
i
answered
the
question
was
just
asking
your
friend
how
it
was
you
made
his
acquaintance
he
helped
me
out
of
a
bit
of
a
mess
in
the
north
sea
you
bartels
he
said
was
nothing
said
bartels
the
north
sea
is
no
place
for
your
little
boat
captain
so
i
have
told
you
many
times
how
did
you
like
flensburg
a
fine
town
is
it
not
did
you
find
herr
krank
the
carpenter
i
see
you
have
placed
a
little
the
rudder
was
nothing
much
but
it
was
well
that
it
held
to
the
eider
but
she
is
strong
and
good
your
little
ship
and
heaven
she
had
need
be
so
he
chuckled
and
shook
his
head
at
davies
as
at
a
wayward
child
this
is
all
the
conversation
that
i
need
record
for
my
part
i
merely
waited
for
its
end
determined
on
my
course
which
was
to
know
the
truth
once
and
for
all
and
make
an
end
of
these
distracting
mystifications
davies
plied
his
friend
with
coffee
and
kept
up
the
talk
gallantly
but
affectionate
as
he
was
his
manner
plainly
showed
that
he
wanted
to
be
alone
with
me
the
gist
of
the
little
skipper
talk
was
a
parental
warning
that
though
we
were
well
enough
here
in
the
it
was
time
for
little
boats
to
be
looking
for
winter
quarters
that
he
himself
was
going
by
the
kiel
canal
to
hamburg
to
spend
a
cosy
winter
as
a
decent
citizen
at
his
warm
fireside
and
that
we
should
follow
his
example
he
ended
with
an
invitation
to
us
to
visit
him
on
the
and
with
suave
farewells
disappeared
into
the
fog
davies
saw
him
into
his
boat
returned
without
wasting
a
moment
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
opposite
me
did
he
mean
i
asked
tell
you
said
davies
tell
you
the
whole
thing
as
far
as
you
concerned
it
partly
a
confession
last
night
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
say
nothing
but
when
bartels
turned
up
i
knew
it
must
all
come
out
it
been
fearfully
on
my
mind
and
perhaps
you
be
able
to
help
me
but
it
for
you
to
decide
away
i
said
know
what
i
was
saying
about
the
frisian
islands
the
other
day
a
thing
happened
there
which
i
never
told
you
when
you
were
asking
about
my
cruise
began
near
norderney
i
put
in
did
you
guess
that
he
asked
a
bad
hand
at
duplicity
i
replied
on
you
quite
right
it
was
there
on
september
i
told
you
the
sort
of
thing
i
was
doing
at
that
time
but
i
do
think
i
said
that
i
made
inquiries
from
one
or
two
people
about
and
had
been
told
by
some
fishermen
at
borkum
that
there
was
a
big
in
those
waters
whose
owner
a
german
of
the
name
of
dollmann
shot
a
good
deal
and
might
give
me
some
tips
well
i
found
this
yacht
one
evening
knowing
it
must
be
her
from
the
description
i
had
she
was
what
is
called
a
of
fifty
or
sixty
tons
built
for
shallow
water
on
the
lines
of
a
dutch
galliot
with
and
those
queer
round
bows
and
square
stern
she
something
like
those
galliots
anchored
near
us
now
you
sometimes
see
the
same
sort
of
yacht
in
english
waters
only
there
they
copy
the
thames
barges
she
looked
a
clipper
of
her
sort
and
very
smart
varnished
all
over
and
shining
like
gold
i
came
on
her
about
sunset
after
a
long
day
of
exploring
round
the
ems
estuary
she
was
lying
in
a
bit
let
have
the
chart
i
interrupted
davies
found
it
and
spread
it
on
the
table
between
us
first
pushing
back
the
cloth
and
the
breakfast
things
to
one
end
where
they
lay
in
a
slovenly
litter
this
was
one
of
the
only
two
occasions
on
which
i
ever
saw
him
postpone
the
rite
of
washing
up
and
it
spoke
volumes
for
the
urgency
of
the
matter
in
hand
it
is
said
davies
see
map
a
and
i
looked
with
a
new
and
strange
interest
at
the
long
string
of
slender
islands
the
parallel
line
of
coast
and
the
confusion
of
shoals
banks
and
channels
which
lay
between
norderney
you
see
by
the
way
there
a
harbour
there
at
the
west
end
of
the
island
the
only
real
harbour
on
the
whole
line
of
islands
dutch
or
german
except
at
terschelling
there
quite
a
big
town
there
too
a
watering
place
where
germans
go
for
in
the
summer
well
the
that
was
her
name
was
lying
in
the
riff
gat
roadstead
flying
the
german
ensign
and
i
anchored
for
the
night
pretty
near
her
i
meant
to
visit
her
owner
later
on
but
i
very
nearly
changed
my
mind
as
i
always
feel
rather
a
fool
on
smart
yachts
and
my
german
is
very
good
however
i
thought
i
might
as
well
so
after
dinner
when
it
was
dark
i
sculled
over
in
the
dinghy
hailed
a
sailor
on
deck
said
who
i
was
and
asked
if
i
could
see
the
owner
the
sailor
was
a
surly
sort
of
chap
and
there
was
a
good
long
delay
while
i
waited
on
deck
feeling
more
and
more
uncomfortable
presently
a
steward
came
up
and
showed
me
down
the
companion
and
into
the
saloon
which
after
looked
well
horribly
gorgeous
you
know
what
i
mean
plush
lounges
silk
cushions
and
that
sort
of
thing
dinner
seemed
to
be
just
over
and
wine
and
fruit
were
on
the
table
herr
dollmann
was
there
at
his
coffee
i
introduced
myself
somehow
a
moment
i
said
was
he
like
a
tall
thin
chap
in
evening
dress
about
fifty
i
suppose
with
greyish
hair
and
a
short
beard
i
not
good
at
describing
people
he
had
a
high
bulging
forehead
and
there
was
something
about
him
but
i
think
i
better
tell
you
the
bare
facts
first
i
ca
say
he
seemed
pleased
to
see
me
and
he
could
speak
english
and
in
fact
i
felt
infernally
awkward
still
i
had
an
object
in
coming
and
as
i
was
there
i
thought
i
might
as
well
gain
it
the
notion
of
davies
in
his
norfolk
jacket
and
rusty
flannels
haranguing
a
frigid
german
in
evening
dress
in
a
saloon
tickled
my
fancy
greatly
seemed
very
much
astonished
to
see
me
had
evidently
seen
the
arrive
and
had
wondered
what
she
was
i
began
as
soon
as
i
could
about
the
ducks
but
he
shut
me
up
at
once
said
i
could
do
nothing
hereabouts
i
put
it
down
to
sportsman
jealousy
you
know
what
that
is
but
i
saw
i
had
come
to
the
wrong
shop
and
was
just
going
to
back
out
and
end
this
unpleasant
interview
when
he
thawed
a
bit
offered
me
some
wine
and
began
talking
in
quite
a
friendly
way
taking
a
great
interest
in
my
cruise
and
my
plans
for
the
future
in
the
end
we
sat
up
quite
late
though
i
never
felt
really
at
my
ease
he
seemed
to
be
taking
stock
of
me
all
the
time
as
though
i
were
some
new
animal
how
i
sympathized
with
that
german
parted
civilly
enough
and
i
rowed
back
and
turned
in
meaning
to
potter
on
eastwards
early
next
day
i
was
knocked
up
at
dawn
by
a
sailor
with
a
message
from
dollmann
asking
if
he
could
come
to
breakfast
with
me
i
was
rather
flabbergasted
but
did
like
to
be
rude
so
i
said
yes
well
he
came
and
i
returned
the
call
and
well
the
end
of
it
was
that
i
stayed
at
anchor
there
for
three
days
this
was
rather
abrupt
did
you
spend
the
time
i
asked
stopping
three
days
anywhere
was
an
unusual
event
for
him
as
i
knew
from
his
log
i
lunched
or
dined
with
him
once
or
twice
with
i
ought
to
say
he
added
hurriedly
daughter
was
with
him
she
appear
the
evening
i
first
called
what
was
she
like
i
asked
promptly
before
he
could
hurry
on
she
seemed
a
very
nice
girl
was
the
guarded
reply
delivered
with
particular
unconcern
the
end
of
it
was
that
i
and
the
sailed
away
in
company
i
must
tell
you
how
it
came
about
just
in
a
few
words
for
the
present
was
his
suggestion
he
said
he
had
to
sail
to
hamburg
and
proposed
that
i
should
go
with
him
in
the
as
far
as
the
elbe
and
then
if
i
liked
i
could
take
the
ship
canal
at
brunsb√ºttel
through
to
kiel
and
the
baltic
i
had
no
very
fixed
plans
of
my
own
though
i
had
meant
to
go
on
exploring
eastwards
between
the
islands
and
the
coast
and
so
reach
the
elbe
in
a
much
slower
way
he
dissuaded
me
from
this
sticking
to
it
that
i
should
have
no
chance
of
ducks
and
urging
other
reasons
anyway
we
settled
to
sail
in
company
direct
to
cuxhaven
in
the
elbe
with
a
fair
wind
and
an
early
start
it
should
be
only
one
day
sail
of
about
sixty
miles
plan
only
came
to
a
head
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
on
the
of
september
told
you
i
think
that
the
weather
had
broken
after
a
long
spell
of
heat
that
very
day
it
had
been
blowing
pretty
hard
from
the
west
and
the
glass
was
falling
still
i
said
of
course
that
i
go
with
him
if
the
weather
was
too
bad
but
he
prophesied
a
good
day
said
it
was
an
easy
sail
and
altogether
put
me
on
my
mettle
you
can
guess
how
it
was
perhaps
i
had
talked
about
cruising
as
though
it
were
easier
than
it
was
though
i
never
meant
it
in
a
boasting
way
for
i
hate
that
sort
of
thing
and
besides
there
no
danger
if
you
careful
go
on
i
said
we
went
next
morning
at
six
it
was
a
day
wind
but
his
sails
were
going
up
and
mine
followed
i
took
two
reefs
in
and
we
sailed
out
into
the
open
and
steered
along
the
coast
for
the
outer
elbe
lightship
about
fifty
knots
off
here
it
all
is
you
see
he
showed
me
the
course
on
the
chart
trip
was
nothing
for
his
boat
of
course
a
safe
powerful
old
tub
forging
through
the
sea
as
steady
as
a
house
i
kept
up
with
her
easily
at
first
my
hands
were
pretty
full
for
there
was
a
hard
wind
on
my
quarter
and
a
troublesome
sea
but
as
long
as
nothing
worse
came
i
knew
i
should
be
all
right
though
i
also
knew
that
i
was
a
fool
to
have
come
illustration
chart
a
to
illustrate
the
stranding
of
the
etc
went
well
till
we
were
off
wangeroog
the
last
of
the
islands
and
then
it
began
to
blow
really
hard
i
had
half
a
mind
to
chuck
it
and
cut
into
the
jade
river
but
i
had
the
face
to
so
i
hove
to
and
took
in
my
last
reef
simple
words
simply
uttered
but
i
had
seen
the
operation
in
calm
water
and
shuddered
at
the
present
picture
had
been
about
level
till
then
but
with
my
shortened
canvas
i
fell
behind
not
that
that
mattered
in
the
least
i
knew
my
course
had
read
up
my
tides
and
thick
as
the
weather
was
i
had
no
doubt
of
being
able
to
pick
up
the
lightship
no
change
of
plan
was
possible
now
the
weser
estuary
was
on
my
starboard
hand
but
the
whole
place
was
a
and
a
mass
of
unknown
banks
just
look
at
them
i
ran
on
the
doing
her
level
best
but
we
had
some
narrow
shaves
of
being
pooped
i
was
about
say
six
miles
of
the
lightship
see
chart
a
when
i
suddenly
saw
that
the
had
hove
to
right
ahead
as
though
waiting
till
i
came
up
she
wore
round
again
on
the
course
as
i
drew
level
and
we
were
alongside
for
a
bit
dollmann
lashed
the
wheel
leaned
over
her
quarter
and
shouted
very
slowly
and
distinctly
so
that
i
could
understand
follow
me
sea
too
bad
for
you
outside
short
cut
through
sands
save
six
miles
was
taking
me
all
my
time
to
manage
the
tiller
but
i
knew
what
he
meant
at
once
for
i
had
been
over
the
chart
carefully
the
night
before
see
map
a
you
see
the
whole
bay
between
wangeroog
and
the
elbe
is
encumbered
with
sand
a
great
jagged
chunk
of
it
runs
out
from
cuxhaven
in
a
direction
for
fifteen
miles
or
so
ending
in
a
pointed
spit
called
the
to
reach
the
elbe
from
the
west
you
have
to
go
right
outside
this
round
the
lightship
which
is
off
the
scharhorn
and
double
back
of
course
that
what
all
big
vessels
do
but
as
you
see
these
sands
are
intersected
here
and
there
by
channels
very
shallow
and
winding
exactly
like
those
behind
the
frisian
islands
now
look
at
this
one
which
cuts
right
through
the
big
chunk
of
sand
and
comes
out
near
cuxhaven
the
see
chart
a
it
called
it
miles
wide
you
see
at
the
entrance
but
later
on
it
is
split
into
two
by
the
hohenh√∂rn
bank
then
it
gets
shallow
and
very
complicated
and
ends
in
a
mere
tidal
driblet
with
another
name
it
just
the
sort
of
channel
i
should
like
to
worry
into
on
a
fine
day
or
with
an
wind
alone
in
thick
weather
and
a
heavy
sea
it
would
have
been
folly
to
attempt
it
except
as
a
desperate
resource
but
as
i
said
i
knew
at
once
that
dollmann
was
proposing
to
run
for
it
and
guide
me
in
did
like
the
idea
because
i
like
doing
things
for
myself
and
silly
as
it
sounds
i
believe
i
resented
being
told
the
sea
was
too
bad
for
me
which
it
certainly
was
yet
the
short
cut
did
save
several
miles
and
a
devil
of
a
tumble
off
the
scharhorn
where
two
tides
meet
i
had
complete
faith
in
dollmann
and
i
suppose
i
decided
that
i
should
be
a
fool
not
to
take
a
good
chance
i
hesitated
i
know
but
in
the
end
i
nodded
and
held
up
my
arm
as
she
forged
ahead
again
soon
after
she
shifted
her
course
and
i
followed
you
asked
me
once
if
i
ever
took
a
pilot
that
was
the
only
time
he
spoke
with
bitter
gravity
flung
himself
back
and
felt
his
pocket
for
his
pipe
it
was
not
meant
for
a
dramatic
pause
but
it
certainly
was
one
i
had
just
a
glimpse
of
still
another
davies
a
davies
five
years
older
throbbing
with
deep
emotions
scorn
passion
and
stubborn
purpose
a
being
above
my
plane
of
sterner
stuff
wider
scope
intense
as
my
interest
had
become
i
waited
almost
timidly
while
he
mechanically
rammed
tobacco
into
his
pipe
and
struck
ineffectual
matches
i
felt
that
whatever
the
riddle
to
be
solved
it
was
no
mean
one
he
repressed
himself
with
an
effort
half
rose
and
made
his
circular
glance
at
the
clock
barometer
and
skylight
and
then
resumed
soon
came
to
what
i
knew
must
be
the
beginning
of
the
telte
channel
all
round
you
could
hear
the
breakers
on
the
sands
though
it
was
too
thick
to
see
them
yet
as
the
water
shoaled
the
sea
of
course
got
shorter
and
steeper
there
was
more
wind
a
whole
gale
i
should
say
kept
dead
in
the
wake
of
the
but
to
my
disgust
i
found
she
was
gaining
on
me
very
fast
of
course
i
had
taken
for
granted
when
he
said
he
would
lead
me
in
that
he
would
slow
down
and
keep
close
to
me
he
could
easily
have
done
so
by
getting
his
men
up
to
check
his
sheets
or
drop
his
peak
instead
of
that
he
was
busting
on
for
all
he
was
worth
once
in
a
i
lost
sight
of
him
altogether
got
him
faintly
again
but
had
enough
to
do
with
my
own
tiller
not
to
want
to
be
peering
through
the
scud
after
a
runaway
pilot
i
was
all
right
so
far
but
we
were
fast
approaching
the
worst
part
of
the
whole
passage
where
the
hohenh√∂rn
bank
blocks
the
road
and
the
channel
divides
i
do
know
what
it
looks
like
to
you
on
the
chart
perhaps
fairly
simple
because
you
can
follow
the
twists
of
the
channels
as
on
a
but
a
stranger
coming
to
a
place
like
that
where
there
are
no
buoys
mind
you
can
tell
nothing
certain
by
the
eye
unless
perhaps
at
dead
low
water
when
the
banks
are
high
and
dry
and
in
very
clear
weather
he
must
trust
to
the
lead
and
the
compass
and
feel
his
way
step
by
step
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
what
i
should
soon
see
would
be
a
wall
of
surf
stretching
right
across
and
on
both
sides
to
one
way
in
that
sort
of
weather
is
impossible
you
must
your
way
or
else
have
a
pilot
i
had
one
but
he
was
playing
his
own
game
a
second
hand
on
board
to
steer
while
i
conned
i
should
have
felt
less
of
an
ass
as
it
was
i
knew
i
ought
to
be
facing
the
music
in
the
offing
and
cursed
myself
for
having
broken
my
rule
and
gone
blundering
into
this
confounded
short
cut
it
was
giving
myself
away
doing
just
the
very
thing
that
you
ca
do
in
sailing
the
time
i
realized
the
danger
it
was
far
too
late
to
turn
and
hammer
out
to
the
open
i
was
deep
in
the
bight
of
the
sands
jammed
on
a
lee
shore
and
a
strong
flood
tide
sweeping
me
on
that
tide
by
the
way
gave
just
the
ghost
of
a
chance
i
had
the
hours
in
my
head
and
knew
it
was
about
flood
with
two
hours
more
of
rising
water
that
meant
the
banks
would
be
all
covering
when
i
reached
them
and
harder
than
ever
to
locate
but
it
also
meant
that
i
float
right
over
the
worst
of
them
if
i
hit
off
a
lucky
place
davies
thumped
the
table
in
disgust
it
makes
me
sick
to
think
of
having
to
trust
to
an
accident
like
that
like
a
lubberly
cockney
out
for
a
boozy
bank
holiday
sail
well
just
as
i
foresaw
the
wall
of
surf
appeared
clean
across
the
horizon
and
curling
back
to
shut
me
in
booming
like
thunder
when
i
last
saw
the
she
seemed
to
be
charging
it
like
a
horse
at
a
fence
and
i
took
a
rough
bearing
of
her
position
by
a
hurried
glance
at
the
compass
at
that
very
moment
i
she
seemed
to
luff
and
show
some
of
her
broadside
but
a
squall
blotted
her
out
and
gave
me
hell
with
the
tiller
after
that
she
was
lost
in
the
white
mist
that
hung
over
the
line
of
breakers
i
kept
on
my
bearing
as
well
as
i
could
but
i
was
already
out
of
the
channel
i
knew
that
by
the
look
of
the
water
and
as
we
neared
the
bank
i
saw
it
was
all
awash
and
without
the
vestige
of
an
opening
i
was
going
to
chuck
her
on
to
it
without
an
effort
so
more
by
instinct
than
with
any
particular
hope
i
put
the
helm
down
meaning
to
work
her
along
the
edge
on
the
chance
of
spotting
a
way
over
she
was
buried
at
once
by
the
beam
sea
and
the
jib
flew
to
blazes
but
the
reefed
stood
she
recovered
gamely
and
i
held
on
though
i
knew
it
could
only
be
for
a
few
minutes
as
the
was
up
and
she
made
frightful
leeway
towards
the
bank
was
by
scud
but
suddenly
i
noticed
what
looked
like
a
gap
behind
a
spit
which
curled
out
right
ahead
i
luffed
still
more
to
clear
this
spit
but
she
could
weather
it
before
you
could
say
knife
she
was
driving
across
it
bumped
heavily
bucked
forward
again
bumped
again
and
ripped
on
in
deeper
water
i
describe
the
next
few
minutes
i
was
in
some
sort
of
channel
but
a
very
narrow
one
and
the
sea
broke
everywhere
i
had
proper
command
either
for
the
rudder
had
crocked
up
somehow
at
the
last
bump
i
was
like
a
drunken
man
running
for
his
life
down
a
dark
alley
barking
himself
at
every
corner
it
could
last
long
and
finally
we
went
crash
on
to
something
and
stopped
there
grinding
and
banging
so
ended
that
little
trip
under
a
pilot
it
was
like
this
there
was
really
no
danger
i
opened
my
eyes
at
the
characteristic
phrase
mean
that
lucky
stumble
into
a
channel
was
my
salvation
since
then
i
had
struggled
through
a
mile
of
sands
all
of
which
lay
behind
me
like
a
breakwater
against
the
gale
they
were
covered
of
course
and
seething
like
soapsuds
but
the
force
of
the
sea
was
deadened
the
was
bumping
but
not
too
heavily
it
was
nearing
high
tide
and
at
half
ebb
she
would
be
high
and
dry
the
ordinary
way
i
should
have
run
out
a
kedge
with
the
dinghy
and
at
the
next
high
water
sailed
farther
in
and
anchored
where
i
could
lie
afloat
the
trouble
was
now
that
my
hand
was
hurt
and
my
dinghy
stove
in
not
to
mention
the
rudder
business
it
was
the
first
bump
on
the
outer
edge
that
did
the
damage
there
was
a
heavy
swell
there
and
when
we
struck
the
dinghy
which
was
towing
astern
came
home
on
her
painter
and
down
with
a
crash
on
the
yacht
weather
quarter
i
stuck
out
one
hand
to
ward
it
off
and
got
it
nipped
on
the
gunwale
she
was
badly
stove
in
and
useless
so
i
could
run
out
the
kedge
this
was
greek
to
me
but
i
let
him
go
on
for
the
present
my
hand
was
too
painful
even
to
stow
the
boom
and
sails
which
were
whipping
and
racketing
about
anyhow
there
was
the
rudder
too
to
be
mended
and
we
were
several
miles
from
the
nearest
land
of
course
if
the
wind
fell
it
was
all
easy
enough
but
if
it
held
or
increased
it
was
a
poor
there
a
limit
to
strain
of
that
sort
and
other
things
might
have
happened
fact
it
was
precious
lucky
that
bartels
turned
up
his
galliot
was
at
anchor
a
mile
away
up
a
branch
of
the
channel
in
a
clear
between
squalls
he
saw
us
and
like
a
brick
rowed
his
boat
out
he
and
his
boy
and
a
devil
of
a
pull
they
must
have
had
i
was
glad
enough
to
see
them
no
that
not
true
i
was
in
such
a
fury
of
disgust
and
shame
that
i
believe
i
should
have
been
idiot
enough
to
say
i
did
want
help
if
he
had
just
nipped
on
board
and
started
work
he
a
terror
to
work
that
little
mouse
of
a
chap
in
half
an
hour
he
had
stowed
the
sails
unshackled
the
big
anchor
run
out
fifty
fathoms
of
warp
and
hauled
her
off
there
and
then
into
deep
water
then
they
towed
her
up
the
channel
it
was
dead
to
leeward
and
an
easy
job
and
berthed
her
near
their
own
vessel
it
was
dark
by
that
time
so
i
gave
them
a
drink
and
said
it
blew
a
howling
gale
that
night
but
the
place
was
safe
enough
with
good
whole
affair
was
over
and
after
supper
i
thought
hard
about
it
all
viii
the
theory
davies
leaned
back
and
gave
a
deep
sigh
as
though
he
still
felt
the
relief
from
some
tension
i
did
the
same
and
felt
the
same
relief
the
chart
freed
from
the
pressure
of
our
fingers
rolled
up
with
a
flip
as
though
to
say
do
you
think
of
that
i
have
straightened
out
his
sentences
a
little
for
in
the
excitement
of
his
story
they
had
grown
more
and
more
jerky
and
elliptical
about
dollmann
i
asked
course
said
davies
about
him
i
did
get
at
much
that
night
it
was
all
so
sudden
the
only
thing
i
could
have
sworn
to
from
the
first
was
that
he
had
purposely
left
me
in
the
lurch
that
day
i
pieced
out
the
rest
in
the
next
few
days
which
i
just
finish
with
as
shortly
as
i
can
bartels
came
aboard
next
morning
and
though
it
was
blowing
hard
still
we
managed
to
shift
the
to
a
place
where
she
dried
safely
at
the
midday
low
water
and
we
could
get
at
her
rudder
the
lower
on
the
stern
post
had
wrenched
out
and
we
botched
it
up
roughly
as
a
makeshift
there
were
other
little
breakages
but
nothing
to
matter
and
the
loss
of
the
jib
was
nothing
as
i
had
two
spare
ones
the
dinghy
was
past
repair
just
then
and
i
lashed
it
on
deck
turned
out
that
bartels
was
carrying
apples
from
bremen
to
kappeln
in
this
fiord
and
had
run
into
that
channel
in
the
sands
for
shelter
from
the
weather
he
was
bound
for
the
eider
river
whence
as
i
told
you
you
can
get
through
by
river
and
canal
into
the
baltic
of
course
the
elbe
route
by
the
new
kaiser
wilhelm
ship
canal
is
the
shortest
the
eider
route
is
the
old
one
but
he
hoped
to
get
rid
of
some
of
his
apples
at
t√∂nning
the
town
at
its
mouth
both
routes
touch
the
baltic
at
kiel
as
you
know
i
had
been
running
for
the
elbe
but
yesterday
put
me
off
and
i
changed
my
mind
i
tell
you
why
presently
and
decided
to
sail
to
the
eider
along
with
the
and
get
through
that
way
it
cleared
from
the
east
next
day
and
i
raced
him
there
winning
hands
down
left
him
at
t√∂nning
and
in
three
days
was
in
the
baltic
it
was
just
a
week
after
i
ran
ashore
that
i
wired
to
you
you
see
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
chap
was
a
in
the
end
it
came
out
quite
quietly
and
suddenly
and
left
me
in
profound
amazement
wired
to
you
that
chap
was
a
spy
it
was
the
close
association
of
these
two
ideas
that
hit
me
hardest
at
the
moment
for
a
second
i
was
back
in
the
dreary
splendour
of
the
london
spelling
out
that
crabbed
scrawl
from
davies
and
fastidiously
criticizing
its
proposal
in
the
light
of
a
holiday
holiday
what
was
to
be
its
issue
chilling
and
opaque
as
the
fog
that
filtered
through
the
skylight
there
flooded
my
imagination
a
mist
of
doubt
and
fear
spy
i
repeated
blankly
do
you
mean
why
did
you
wire
to
me
a
spy
of
what
of
whom
tell
you
how
i
worked
it
out
said
davies
do
think
spy
is
the
right
word
but
i
mean
something
pretty
bad
purposely
put
me
ashore
i
do
think
i
suspicious
by
nature
but
i
know
something
about
boats
and
the
sea
i
know
he
could
have
kept
close
to
me
if
he
had
chosen
and
i
saw
the
whole
place
at
low
water
when
we
left
those
sands
on
the
second
day
look
at
the
chart
again
here
the
hohenh√∂rn
bank
that
i
showed
you
as
blocking
the
road
see
chart
a
it
in
two
pieces
first
the
west
and
then
the
east
you
see
the
telte
channel
dividing
into
two
branches
and
curving
round
it
both
branches
are
broad
and
deep
as
channels
go
in
those
waters
now
in
sailing
in
i
was
nowhere
near
either
of
them
when
i
last
saw
dollmann
he
must
have
been
steering
straight
for
the
bank
itself
at
a
point
somewhere
quite
a
mile
from
the
northern
arm
of
the
channel
and
two
from
the
southern
i
followed
by
compass
as
you
know
and
found
nothing
but
breakers
ahead
how
did
i
get
through
that
where
the
luck
came
in
i
spoke
of
only
two
channels
that
is
the
bank
one
to
the
north
the
other
to
the
south
but
look
closely
and
you
see
that
right
through
the
centre
of
the
west
hohenh√∂rn
runs
another
a
very
narrow
and
winding
one
so
small
that
i
had
even
noticed
it
the
night
before
when
i
was
going
over
the
chart
that
was
the
one
i
stumbled
into
in
that
tailor
fashion
as
i
was
groping
along
the
edge
of
the
surf
in
a
desperate
effort
to
gain
time
i
bolted
down
it
blindly
came
out
into
this
strip
of
open
water
crossed
that
aimlessly
and
brought
up
on
the
edge
of
the
hohenh√∂rn
it
was
more
than
i
deserved
i
can
see
now
that
it
was
a
hundred
to
one
in
favour
of
my
striking
on
a
bad
place
outside
where
i
should
have
gone
to
pieces
in
three
minutes
how
did
dollmann
go
i
asked
as
clear
as
possible
davies
answered
doubled
back
into
the
northern
channel
when
he
had
misled
me
enough
do
you
remember
my
saying
that
when
i
last
saw
him
i
he
had
luffed
and
showed
his
broadside
i
had
another
bit
of
luck
in
that
he
was
luffing
towards
the
north
so
it
struck
me
through
the
blur
and
when
i
in
my
turn
came
up
to
the
bank
and
had
to
turn
one
way
or
the
other
to
avoid
it
i
think
i
should
naturally
have
turned
north
too
as
he
had
done
in
that
case
i
should
have
been
done
for
for
i
should
have
had
a
mile
of
the
bank
to
skirt
before
reaching
the
north
channel
and
should
have
driven
ashore
long
before
i
got
there
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
turned
south
help
it
i
was
running
on
the
starboard
tack
boom
over
to
port
to
turn
north
would
have
meant
a
jibe
and
as
things
were
i
could
risk
one
it
was
blowing
like
fits
if
anything
had
carried
away
i
should
have
been
on
shore
in
a
jiffy
i
scarcely
thought
about
it
at
all
but
put
the
helm
down
and
turned
her
south
though
i
knew
nothing
about
it
that
little
central
channel
was
now
on
my
port
hand
distant
about
two
cables
the
whole
thing
was
luck
from
beginning
to
end
helped
by
pluck
i
thought
to
myself
as
i
tried
with
my
fancy
to
conjure
up
that
perilous
scene
as
to
the
truth
of
the
affair
the
chart
and
davies
version
were
easy
enough
to
follow
but
i
felt
only
half
convinced
the
as
davies
strangely
called
his
pilot
might
have
honestly
mistaken
the
course
himself
outstripped
his
convoy
inadvertently
and
escaped
disaster
as
narrowly
as
she
did
i
suggested
this
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
but
davies
was
impatient
till
you
hear
the
whole
thing
he
said
must
go
back
to
when
i
first
met
him
i
told
you
that
on
that
first
evening
he
began
by
being
as
rude
as
a
bear
and
as
cold
as
stone
and
then
became
suddenly
friendly
i
can
see
now
that
in
the
talk
that
followed
he
was
pumping
me
hard
it
was
an
easy
game
to
play
for
i
had
seen
a
gentleman
since
morrison
left
me
i
was
tremendously
keen
about
my
voyage
and
i
thought
the
chap
was
a
good
sportsman
even
if
he
was
a
bit
dark
about
the
ducks
i
talked
quite
freely
at
least
as
freely
as
i
could
with
my
bad
german
about
my
last
fortnight
sailing
how
i
had
been
smelling
out
all
the
channels
in
and
out
of
the
islands
how
interested
i
had
been
in
the
whole
business
puzzling
out
the
effect
of
the
winds
on
the
tides
the
set
of
the
currents
and
so
on
i
talked
about
my
difficulties
too
the
changes
in
the
buoys
the
prehistoric
rottenness
of
the
english
charts
he
drew
me
out
as
much
as
he
could
and
in
the
light
of
what
followed
i
can
see
the
point
of
scores
of
his
questions
next
day
and
the
next
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
him
and
the
same
thing
went
on
and
then
there
were
my
plans
for
the
future
my
idea
was
as
i
told
you
to
go
on
exploring
the
german
coast
just
as
i
had
the
dutch
his
idea
heavens
how
plainly
i
see
it
now
was
to
choke
me
off
get
me
to
clear
out
altogether
from
that
part
of
the
coast
that
was
why
he
said
there
were
no
ducks
that
was
why
he
cracked
up
the
baltic
as
a
and
and
that
was
why
he
broached
and
stuck
to
that
plan
of
sailing
in
company
direct
to
the
elbe
it
was
to
me
clear
improved
on
that
but
after
that
it
i
mean
that
i
ca
tell
when
he
first
decided
to
go
one
better
and
drown
me
he
could
count
for
certain
on
bad
weather
though
he
held
my
nose
to
it
when
it
came
but
granted
that
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me
altogether
he
got
a
magnificent
chance
on
that
trip
to
the
elbe
lightship
i
expect
it
struck
him
suddenly
and
he
acted
on
the
impulse
left
to
myself
i
was
all
right
but
the
short
cut
was
a
grand
idea
of
his
everything
was
in
its
favour
wind
sea
sand
tide
he
thinks
i
dead
the
crew
i
said
about
the
crew
another
thing
when
he
first
hove
to
waiting
for
me
of
course
they
were
on
deck
two
of
them
i
think
hauling
at
sheets
but
by
the
time
i
had
drawn
up
level
the
had
worn
round
again
on
her
course
and
no
one
was
on
deck
but
dollmann
at
the
wheel
no
one
overheard
what
he
said
they
have
you
again
likely
not
the
weather
was
very
thick
and
the
is
very
small
the
incongruity
of
the
whole
business
was
striking
me
why
should
anyone
want
to
kill
davies
and
why
should
davies
the
soul
of
modesty
and
simplicity
imagine
that
anyone
wanted
to
kill
him
he
must
have
cogent
reasons
for
he
was
the
last
man
to
give
way
to
a
morbid
fancy
on
i
said
was
his
motive
a
german
finds
an
englishman
exploring
a
bit
of
german
coast
determines
to
stop
him
and
even
to
get
rid
of
him
it
looks
so
far
as
if
you
were
thought
to
be
the
spy
davies
winced
he
not
a
he
said
hotly
an
englishman
englishman
i
sure
of
it
not
that
i
much
to
go
on
he
professed
to
know
very
little
english
and
never
spoke
it
except
a
word
or
two
now
and
then
to
help
me
out
of
a
sentence
and
as
to
his
german
he
seemed
to
me
to
speak
it
like
a
native
but
of
course
i
no
judge
davies
sighed
where
i
wanted
someone
like
you
you
would
have
spotted
him
at
once
if
he
was
german
i
go
more
by
a
what
do
you
call
it
a
impression
i
suggested
that
what
i
mean
it
was
something
in
his
looks
and
manner
you
know
how
different
we
are
from
foreigners
and
it
was
only
himself
it
was
the
way
he
talked
i
mean
about
cruising
and
the
sea
especially
it
true
he
let
me
do
most
of
the
talking
but
all
the
same
how
can
i
explain
it
i
felt
we
understood
one
another
in
a
way
that
two
foreigners
would
pretended
to
think
me
a
bit
crazy
for
coming
so
far
in
a
small
boat
but
i
could
swear
he
knew
as
much
about
the
game
as
i
did
for
lots
of
little
questions
he
asked
had
the
right
ring
in
them
mind
you
all
this
is
an
afterthought
i
should
never
have
bothered
about
it
i
not
cut
out
for
a
sherlock
holmes
if
it
had
been
for
what
followed
rather
vague
i
said
you
no
more
definite
reason
for
thinking
him
english
were
one
or
two
things
rather
more
definite
said
davies
slowly
know
when
he
hove
to
and
hailed
me
proposing
the
short
cut
i
told
you
roughly
what
he
said
i
forget
the
exact
words
but
abschneiden
came
in
durch
watten
and
abschneiden
they
call
the
banks
watts
you
know
they
were
simple
words
and
he
shouted
them
loud
so
as
to
carry
through
the
wind
i
understood
what
he
meant
but
as
i
told
you
i
hesitated
before
consenting
i
suppose
he
thought
i
did
understand
for
just
as
he
was
drawing
ahead
again
he
pointed
to
the
and
then
shouted
through
his
hands
as
a
trumpet
verstehen
sie
through
sands
follow
me
the
last
two
sentences
in
downright
english
i
can
hear
those
words
now
and
i
swear
they
were
in
his
native
tongue
of
course
i
thought
nothing
of
it
at
the
time
i
was
quite
aware
that
he
knew
a
few
english
words
though
he
had
always
mispronounced
them
an
easy
trick
when
your
hearer
suspects
nothing
but
i
need
say
that
just
then
i
was
observant
of
trifles
i
do
pretend
to
be
able
to
unravel
a
plot
and
steer
a
small
boat
before
a
heavy
sea
at
the
same
moment
if
he
was
piloting
you
into
the
next
world
he
could
afford
to
commit
himself
before
you
parted
was
there
anything
else
by
the
way
how
did
the
daughter
strike
you
did
she
look
english
too
two
men
can
not
discuss
a
woman
freely
without
a
deep
foundation
of
intimacy
and
until
this
day
the
subject
had
never
arisen
between
us
in
any
form
it
was
the
last
that
was
likely
to
for
i
could
have
divined
that
davies
would
have
met
it
with
an
armour
of
reserve
he
was
busy
putting
on
this
armour
now
yet
i
could
not
help
feeling
a
little
brutal
as
i
saw
how
badly
he
jointed
his
clumsy
suit
of
mail
our
ages
were
the
same
but
i
laugh
now
to
think
how
old
and
i
felt
as
the
flush
warmed
his
brown
skin
and
he
slowly
propounded
the
verdict
i
think
she
did
nothing
but
german
i
suppose
of
course
you
see
much
of
her
good
deal
she
how
frame
it
she
want
you
to
sail
to
the
elbe
with
them
seemed
to
admitted
davies
reluctantly
clutching
at
his
ally
the
hang
it
do
dream
that
she
knew
what
was
coming
he
added
with
sudden
fire
i
pondered
and
wondered
shrinking
from
further
inquisition
easy
as
it
would
have
been
with
so
truthful
a
victim
and
banishing
all
thought
of
chaff
there
was
a
in
this
strange
affair
whose
depth
and
strength
i
was
beginning
to
gauge
with
increasing
seriousness
i
did
not
know
my
man
yet
and
i
did
not
know
myself
a
conviction
that
events
in
the
near
future
would
force
us
into
complete
mutual
confidence
withheld
me
from
pressing
him
too
far
i
returned
to
the
main
question
who
was
dollmann
and
what
was
his
motive
davies
struggled
out
of
his
armour
convinced
he
said
he
an
englishman
in
german
service
he
must
be
in
german
service
for
he
had
evidently
been
in
those
waters
a
long
time
and
knew
every
inch
of
them
of
course
it
a
very
lonely
part
of
the
world
but
he
has
a
house
on
norderney
island
and
he
and
all
about
him
must
be
well
known
to
a
certain
number
of
people
one
of
his
friends
i
happened
to
meet
what
do
you
think
he
was
a
naval
officer
it
was
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
and
we
were
having
coffee
on
the
deck
of
the
and
talking
about
next
day
trip
when
a
little
launch
came
buzzing
up
from
seaward
drew
alongside
and
this
chap
i
speaking
of
came
on
board
shook
hands
with
dollmann
and
stared
hard
at
me
dollmann
introduced
us
calling
him
commander
von
br√ºning
in
command
of
the
torpedo
gunboat
he
pointed
towards
norderney
and
i
saw
her
a
low
grey
rat
of
a
vessel
anchored
in
the
roads
about
two
miles
away
it
turned
out
that
she
was
doing
the
work
of
fishery
guardship
on
that
part
of
the
coast
must
say
i
took
to
him
at
once
he
looked
a
real
good
sort
and
a
splendid
officer
too
just
the
sort
of
chap
i
should
have
liked
to
be
you
know
i
always
wanted
but
that
an
old
story
and
can
wait
i
had
some
talk
with
him
and
we
got
on
capitally
as
far
as
we
went
but
that
was
far
for
i
left
pretty
soon
guessing
that
they
wanted
to
be
alone
they
alone
then
i
asked
innocently
fr√§ulein
dollmann
was
there
of
course
explained
davies
feeling
for
his
armour
again
he
seem
to
know
them
well
i
pursued
inconsequently
yes
very
well
scenting
a
faint
clue
i
felt
the
need
of
feminine
weapons
for
my
sensitive
antagonist
but
the
opportunity
passed
was
the
last
i
saw
of
him
he
said
sailed
as
i
told
you
at
daybreak
next
morning
now
have
you
got
any
idea
what
i
driving
at
rough
idea
i
answered
ahead
davies
sat
up
to
the
table
unrolled
the
chart
with
a
vigorous
sweep
of
his
two
hands
and
took
up
his
parable
with
new
zest
start
with
two
certainties
he
said
is
that
i
was
moved
on
from
that
coast
because
i
was
too
inquisitive
the
other
is
that
dollmann
is
at
some
devil
work
there
which
is
worth
finding
out
now
he
paused
in
a
gasping
effort
to
be
logical
and
articulate
well
look
at
the
chart
no
better
still
look
first
at
this
map
of
germany
it
on
a
small
scale
and
you
can
see
the
whole
thing
he
snatched
down
a
from
the
shelf
and
unfolded
it
see
map
a
this
huge
empire
stretching
half
over
central
europe
an
empire
growing
like
wildfire
i
believe
in
people
and
wealth
and
everything
they
licked
the
french
and
the
austrians
and
are
the
greatest
military
power
in
europe
i
wish
i
knew
more
about
all
that
but
what
i
concerned
with
is
their
a
new
thing
with
them
but
it
going
strong
and
that
emperor
of
theirs
is
running
it
for
all
it
worth
he
a
splendid
chap
and
anyone
can
see
he
right
they
got
no
colonies
to
speak
of
and
have
them
like
us
they
ca
get
them
and
keep
them
and
they
ca
protect
their
huge
commerce
without
naval
strength
the
command
of
the
sea
is
thing
nowadays
is
it
i
say
think
these
are
my
ideas
he
added
na√Øvely
all
out
of
mahan
and
those
fellows
well
the
germans
have
got
a
small
fleet
at
present
but
it
a
thundering
good
one
and
they
building
hard
there
the
and
the
he
broke
off
into
a
digression
on
armaments
and
speeds
in
which
i
could
not
follow
him
he
seemed
to
know
every
ship
by
heart
i
had
to
recall
him
to
the
point
think
of
germany
as
a
new
he
resumed
next
thing
is
what
is
her
it
a
very
queer
one
as
you
know
split
clean
in
two
by
denmark
most
of
it
lying
east
of
that
and
looking
on
the
baltic
which
is
practically
an
inland
sea
with
its
entrance
blocked
by
danish
islands
it
was
to
evade
that
block
that
william
built
the
ship
canal
from
kiel
to
the
elbe
but
that
could
be
easily
smashed
in
far
the
most
important
bit
of
is
that
which
lies
of
denmark
and
looks
on
the
north
sea
it
there
that
germany
gets
her
head
out
into
the
open
so
to
speak
it
there
that
she
fronts
us
and
france
the
two
great
of
western
europe
and
it
there
that
her
greatest
ports
are
and
her
richest
commerce
it
must
strike
you
at
once
that
it
ridiculously
short
compared
with
the
huge
country
behind
it
from
borkum
to
the
elbe
as
the
crow
flies
is
only
seventy
miles
add
to
that
the
west
coast
of
schleswig
say
miles
total
say
two
hundred
compare
that
with
the
seaboard
of
france
and
england
does
it
stand
to
reason
that
every
inch
of
it
is
important
now
what
of
coast
is
it
even
on
this
small
map
you
can
see
at
once
by
all
those
wavy
lines
shoals
and
sand
everywhere
blocking
of
the
land
altogether
and
doing
their
best
to
block
the
other
tenth
where
the
great
rivers
run
in
now
let
take
it
bit
by
bit
you
see
it
divides
itself
into
three
beginning
from
the
west
the
is
from
borkum
to
wangeroog
fifty
odd
miles
what
that
like
a
string
of
sandy
islands
backed
by
sand
the
ems
river
at
the
western
end
on
the
dutch
border
leading
to
emden
not
much
of
a
place
otherwise
no
coast
towns
at
all
piece
a
deep
sort
of
bay
consisting
of
the
three
great
estuaries
the
jade
the
weser
and
the
elbe
leading
to
wilhelmshaven
their
north
sea
naval
base
bremen
and
hamburg
total
breadth
of
bay
twenty
odd
miles
only
sandbanks
littered
about
all
through
it
piece
the
schleswig
coast
hopelessly
fenced
in
behind
a
six
to
eight
mile
fringe
of
sand
no
big
towns
one
moderate
river
the
eider
let
leave
that
third
piece
aside
i
may
be
wrong
but
in
thinking
this
business
out
pegged
away
chiefly
at
the
other
two
the
stretch
from
borkum
to
the
elbe
half
of
it
estuaries
and
half
islands
it
was
there
that
i
found
the
and
it
that
stretch
that
thanks
to
him
i
missed
exploring
i
made
an
obvious
conjecture
suppose
there
are
forts
and
coast
defences
perhaps
he
thought
you
would
see
too
much
by
the
way
he
saw
your
naval
books
of
course
of
course
that
was
my
first
idea
but
it
ca
be
that
it
does
explain
things
in
the
least
to
begin
with
there
no
forts
and
can
be
none
in
that
first
division
where
the
islands
are
there
might
be
something
on
borkum
to
defend
the
ems
but
it
very
unlikely
and
anyway
i
had
passed
borkum
and
was
at
norderney
there
nothing
else
to
defend
of
course
it
different
in
the
second
division
where
the
big
rivers
are
there
are
probably
hosts
of
forts
and
mines
round
wilhelmshaven
and
bremerhaven
and
at
cuxhaven
just
at
the
mouth
of
the
elbe
not
that
i
should
ever
dream
of
bothering
about
them
every
steamer
that
goes
in
would
see
as
much
as
me
personally
i
much
prefer
to
stay
on
board
and
do
often
go
on
shore
and
good
heavens
davies
leant
back
and
laughed
joyously
i
like
that
kind
of
spy
i
figured
to
myself
one
of
those
romantic
gentlemen
that
one
reads
of
in
sixpenny
magazines
with
a
kodak
in
his
a
in
the
lining
of
his
coat
and
a
selection
of
disguises
in
his
hand
luggage
little
disposed
for
merriment
as
i
was
i
could
not
help
smiling
too
this
coast
resumed
davies
the
event
of
war
it
seems
to
me
that
every
inch
of
it
would
be
important
and
take
the
big
estuaries
first
which
of
course
might
be
attacked
or
blockaded
by
an
enemy
at
first
sight
you
would
say
that
their
main
channels
were
the
only
things
that
mattered
now
in
time
of
peace
there
no
secrecy
about
the
navigation
of
these
they
buoyed
and
lighted
like
streets
open
to
the
whole
world
and
taking
an
immense
traffic
well
charted
too
as
millions
of
pounds
in
commerce
depend
on
them
but
now
look
at
the
sands
they
run
through
intersected
as
i
showed
you
by
threads
of
channels
tidal
for
the
most
part
and
probably
only
known
to
smacks
and
shallow
coasters
like
that
galliot
of
bartels
strikes
me
that
in
a
war
a
lot
might
depend
on
these
both
in
defence
and
attack
for
there
plenty
of
water
in
them
at
the
right
tide
for
and
small
torpedo
craft
though
i
can
see
they
take
a
lot
of
knowing
now
say
were
at
war
with
germany
both
sides
could
use
them
as
lines
between
the
three
estuaries
and
to
take
our
own
case
a
small
not
a
destroyer
mind
you
could
on
a
dark
night
cut
clean
through
from
the
jade
to
the
elbe
and
play
the
deuce
with
the
shipping
there
but
the
trouble
is
that
i
doubt
if
there
a
soul
in
our
fleet
who
knows
those
channels
have
coasters
there
and
as
to
yachts
it
a
most
unlikely
game
for
an
english
yacht
to
play
at
but
it
does
so
happen
that
i
have
a
fancy
for
that
sort
of
thing
and
would
have
explored
those
channels
in
the
ordinary
course
i
began
to
see
his
drift
for
the
islands
i
was
rather
stumped
there
at
first
i
grant
because
though
there
are
lashings
of
sand
behind
them
and
the
same
sort
of
intersecting
channels
yet
there
seems
nothing
important
to
guard
or
attack
should
a
stranger
ramble
as
he
pleases
through
them
still
dollmann
had
his
headquarters
there
and
i
was
sure
that
had
some
meaning
then
it
struck
me
that
the
same
point
held
good
for
that
strip
of
frisian
coast
adjoins
the
estuaries
and
would
also
form
a
splendid
base
for
raiding
midgets
which
could
travel
unseen
right
through
from
the
ems
to
the
jade
and
so
to
the
elbe
as
by
a
covered
way
between
a
line
of
forts
here
again
it
an
unknown
land
to
us
plenty
of
local
galliots
travel
it
but
strangers
never
i
should
say
perhaps
at
the
most
an
occasional
foreign
yacht
gropes
in
at
one
of
the
gaps
between
the
islands
for
shelter
from
bad
weather
and
is
precious
lucky
to
get
in
safe
once
again
it
was
my
fad
to
like
such
places
and
dollmann
cleared
me
out
he
not
a
german
but
he
in
with
germans
and
naval
germans
too
he
established
on
that
coast
and
knows
it
by
heart
and
he
tried
to
drown
me
now
what
do
you
think
he
gazed
at
me
long
and
anxiously
ix
i
sign
articles
it
was
not
an
easy
question
to
answer
for
the
affair
was
utterly
outside
all
my
experience
its
background
the
sea
and
its
actual
scene
a
region
of
the
sea
of
which
i
was
blankly
ignorant
there
were
other
difficulties
that
i
could
see
perhaps
better
than
davies
an
enthusiast
with
hobbies
who
had
been
brooding
in
solitude
over
his
dangerous
adventure
yet
both
narrative
and
theory
which
have
lost
i
fear
in
interpretation
to
the
reader
had
strongly
affected
me
his
forcible
roughnesses
tricks
of
manner
sudden
bursts
of
ardour
sudden
retreats
into
shyness
making
up
a
charm
i
can
not
render
i
found
myself
continually
trying
to
see
the
man
through
the
boy
to
distinguish
sober
judgement
from
the
vagaries
of
youth
not
that
i
dreamed
for
a
moment
of
dismissing
the
story
of
his
wreck
as
an
hallucination
his
clear
blue
eyes
and
sane
simplicity
threw
ridicule
on
such
treatment
evidently
too
he
wanted
my
help
a
matter
that
might
well
have
influenced
my
opinion
on
the
facts
had
he
been
other
than
he
was
but
it
would
have
taken
a
and
finite
clod
to
resist
the
attraction
of
the
man
and
the
enterprise
and
i
take
no
credit
whatever
for
deciding
to
follow
him
right
or
wrong
so
when
i
stated
my
difficulties
i
knew
very
well
that
we
should
go
are
two
main
points
that
i
do
understand
i
said
you
never
explained
why
an
should
be
watching
those
waters
and
ejecting
intruders
secondly
your
theory
does
supply
sufficient
motive
there
may
be
much
in
what
you
say
about
the
navigation
of
those
channels
but
it
not
enough
you
say
he
wanted
to
drown
you
a
big
charge
requiring
a
big
motive
to
support
it
but
i
do
deny
that
you
got
a
strong
case
davies
lighted
up
willing
to
take
a
good
deal
for
granted
until
we
find
out
more
he
jumped
up
and
did
a
thing
i
never
saw
him
do
before
or
since
bumped
his
head
against
the
cabin
roof
mean
that
you
come
he
exclaimed
i
had
even
asked
you
yes
i
want
to
go
back
and
clear
up
the
whole
thing
i
know
now
that
i
want
to
telling
it
all
to
you
has
been
such
an
immense
relief
and
a
lot
depended
on
you
too
and
that
why
i
been
feeling
such
an
absolute
hypocrite
i
say
how
can
i
apologize
worry
about
me
i
had
a
splendid
time
and
i
come
right
enough
but
i
should
like
to
know
exactly
what
you
but
wait
till
i
just
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
about
you
i
mean
you
see
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
could
do
nothing
alone
not
that
two
are
really
necessary
for
managing
the
boat
in
the
ordinary
way
but
for
this
sort
of
job
you
want
two
besides
i
ca
speak
german
properly
and
i
a
dull
chap
all
round
if
my
theory
as
you
call
it
is
right
it
a
case
for
sharp
wits
if
ever
there
was
one
so
i
thought
of
you
you
clever
and
i
knew
you
had
lived
in
germany
and
knew
german
and
i
knew
he
added
with
a
little
awkwardness
you
had
done
a
good
deal
of
yachting
but
of
course
i
ought
to
have
told
you
what
you
were
in
for
roughing
it
in
a
small
boat
with
no
crew
i
felt
ashamed
of
myself
when
you
wired
back
so
promptly
and
when
you
came
er
davies
stammered
and
hesitated
in
the
humane
resolve
not
to
wound
my
feelings
course
i
could
help
noticing
that
it
was
what
you
expected
was
the
delicate
summary
he
arrived
at
you
took
it
splendidly
he
hastened
to
add
somehow
i
could
bring
myself
to
talk
about
the
plan
it
was
good
enough
of
you
to
come
out
at
all
without
bothering
you
with
schemes
beside
i
was
even
sure
of
myself
it
a
tangled
business
there
were
reasons
there
are
reasons
still
he
looked
nervously
at
me
well
which
make
it
a
tangled
business
i
had
thought
a
confidence
was
coming
and
was
disappointed
was
in
an
idiotic
state
of
uncertainty
he
hurried
on
the
plan
grew
on
me
more
and
more
when
i
saw
how
you
were
taking
to
the
life
and
beginning
to
enjoy
yourself
all
that
about
the
ducks
on
the
frisian
coast
was
humbug
part
of
a
stupid
idea
of
decoying
you
there
and
gaining
time
however
you
quite
naturally
objected
and
last
night
i
meant
to
chuck
the
whole
thing
up
and
give
you
the
best
time
here
i
could
then
bartels
turned
up
i
put
in
you
know
he
might
turn
up
when
you
sailed
here
said
davies
guiltily
knew
he
might
and
now
it
all
come
out
and
you
come
what
a
fool
i
been
long
before
he
had
finished
i
had
grasped
the
whole
meaning
of
the
last
few
days
and
had
read
their
meaning
into
scores
of
little
incidents
which
had
puzzled
me
goodness
sake
do
apologize
i
protested
could
make
confessions
too
if
i
liked
and
i
doubt
if
you
been
such
a
fool
as
you
think
i
a
patient
that
wants
careful
nursing
and
it
has
been
the
merest
chance
all
through
that
i
have
rebelled
and
bolted
we
got
a
good
deal
to
thank
the
weather
for
and
other
little
stimulants
and
you
do
know
yet
my
reasons
for
deciding
to
try
your
cure
at
all
cure
said
davies
in
the
world
do
you
mean
it
was
jolly
decent
of
you
to
mind
there
another
view
of
it
but
it
does
matter
now
let
return
to
the
point
what
your
plan
of
action
this
was
the
prompt
reply
get
back
to
the
north
sea
kiel
and
the
ship
canal
then
there
will
be
two
objects
one
to
work
back
to
norderney
where
i
left
off
before
exploring
all
those
channels
through
the
estuaries
and
islands
the
other
to
find
dollmann
discover
what
he
up
to
and
settle
with
him
the
two
things
may
overlap
we
ca
tell
yet
i
do
even
know
where
he
and
his
yacht
are
but
i
be
bound
they
somewhere
in
those
same
waters
and
probably
back
at
norderney
a
delicate
matter
i
mused
dubiously
your
correct
spying
on
a
spy
not
like
that
said
davies
indignantly
who
likes
can
sail
about
there
and
explore
those
waters
i
say
you
do
really
think
it
like
that
do
you
do
think
you
likely
to
do
anything
dishonourable
i
hastened
to
explain
grant
you
the
sea
public
property
in
your
sense
i
only
mean
that
developments
are
possible
which
you
reckon
on
there
be
more
to
find
out
than
the
mere
navigation
of
those
channels
and
if
that
so
might
we
come
to
be
genuine
spies
ourselves
after
all
hang
it
exclaimed
davies
it
comes
to
that
why
should
we
i
look
at
it
like
this
the
man
an
englishman
and
if
he
in
with
germany
he
a
traitor
to
us
and
we
as
englishmen
have
a
right
to
expose
him
if
we
ca
do
it
without
spying
we
a
right
to
spy
at
our
own
risk
a
stronger
argument
than
that
he
tried
to
take
your
life
do
care
a
rap
about
that
i
not
such
an
ass
as
to
thirst
for
revenge
and
all
that
like
some
chap
in
a
shilling
shocker
but
it
makes
me
wild
to
think
of
that
fellow
masquerading
as
a
german
and
up
to
who
knows
what
mischief
mischief
enough
to
make
him
want
to
get
rid
of
one
i
keen
about
the
sea
and
i
think
they
apt
to
be
a
bit
slack
at
home
he
continued
inconsequently
admiralty
chaps
want
waking
up
anyway
as
far
as
i
concerned
quite
natural
that
i
should
look
him
up
again
i
agreed
parted
friends
and
they
may
be
delighted
to
see
you
you
have
plenty
to
talk
about
said
davies
withered
into
silence
by
the
i
say
do
you
know
it
three
how
the
time
has
gone
and
by
jove
i
believe
the
fog
lifting
i
returned
with
a
shock
to
the
present
to
the
weeping
walls
the
discoloured
deal
table
the
ghastly
breakfast
litter
all
the
visible
symbols
of
the
life
i
had
pledged
myself
to
disillusionment
was
making
rapid
headway
when
davies
returned
and
said
with
energy
do
you
say
to
starting
for
kiel
at
once
the
fog
going
and
there
a
breeze
from
the
i
protested
it
mean
sailing
all
night
wo
it
no
said
davies
with
luck
it
dark
at
seven
but
it
only
miles
i
know
it
not
exactly
a
fair
wind
but
we
shall
lie
closehauled
most
of
the
way
the
glass
is
falling
and
we
ought
to
take
this
chance
to
argue
about
winds
with
davies
was
hopeless
and
the
upshot
was
that
we
started
lunchless
a
pale
sun
was
flickering
out
of
masses
of
racing
vapour
and
through
delicate
vistas
between
them
the
fair
land
of
schleswig
now
revealed
and
now
withdrew
her
pretty
face
as
though
smiling
to
her
faithless
courtiers
the
clank
of
our
chain
brought
up
bartels
to
the
deck
of
the
rubbing
his
eyes
and
pulling
round
his
throat
a
grey
shawl
which
gave
him
a
comical
likeness
to
a
landlady
receiving
the
milk
in
morning
off
bartels
said
davies
without
looking
up
from
his
work
you
at
kiel
i
hope
are
always
in
a
hurry
captain
bleated
the
old
man
shaking
his
head
should
wait
till
the
sky
is
not
good
and
it
will
be
dark
before
you
are
off
eckenf√∂rde
davies
laughed
and
very
soon
his
mentor
sad
little
figure
was
lost
in
haze
that
was
a
curious
evening
dusk
soon
fell
and
the
devil
made
a
determined
effort
to
unman
me
first
with
the
scrambled
tea
which
was
the
tardy
substitute
for
an
orderly
lunch
then
with
the
new
and
nauseous
duty
of
filling
the
which
meant
squatting
in
the
to
inhale
paraffin
and
dabble
in
lastly
with
an
attack
on
my
nerves
as
the
night
fell
on
our
frail
little
vessel
pitching
on
her
precarious
way
through
driving
mist
in
a
sense
i
think
i
went
through
the
same
sort
of
mental
crisis
as
when
i
sat
upon
my
portmanteau
at
flensburg
the
main
issue
was
not
seriously
in
question
for
i
had
signed
on
in
the
for
good
or
ill
but
in
doing
so
i
had
outrun
myself
and
still
wanted
an
outlook
a
mood
suited
to
the
enterprise
proof
against
petty
discouragements
not
for
the
first
time
a
sense
of
the
ludicrous
came
to
my
assistance
as
i
saw
myself
fretting
in
london
under
my
burden
of
woes
nicely
weighing
that
insidious
invitation
and
stepping
finally
into
the
snare
with
the
dignity
due
to
my
importance
kidnapped
as
neatly
as
ever
a
peaceful
clerk
was
kidnapped
by
a
lawless
and
in
the
end
finding
as
the
a
guileless
and
friend
who
called
me
clever
lodged
me
in
a
cell
and
blandly
invited
me
to
talk
german
to
the
purpose
as
he
was
aiming
at
a
little
secret
service
on
the
high
seas
close
in
the
train
of
humour
came
romance
veiling
her
face
but
i
knew
it
was
the
rustle
of
her
robes
that
i
heard
in
the
foam
beneath
me
i
knew
that
it
was
she
who
handed
me
the
cup
of
sparkling
wine
and
bade
me
drink
and
be
merry
strange
to
me
though
it
was
i
knew
the
taste
when
it
touched
my
lips
it
was
not
that
bastard
concoction
i
had
tasted
in
the
of
soho
it
was
not
the
showy
but
insipid
beverage
i
should
have
drunk
my
fill
of
at
morven
lodge
it
was
the
purest
of
her
pure
vintages
instilling
the
ancient
inspiration
which
under
many
guises
quickens
thousands
of
better
brains
than
mine
but
whose
essence
is
always
the
same
the
gay
pursuit
of
a
perilous
quest
then
and
there
i
tried
to
clinch
the
matter
and
keep
that
mood
in
the
main
i
think
i
succeeded
though
i
had
many
lapses
for
the
present
my
veins
tingled
with
the
draught
the
wind
humming
into
the
mainsail
the
ghostly
riding
up
out
of
the
void
whispered
a
low
thrilling
chorus
in
praise
of
adventure
potent
indeed
must
the
spell
have
been
for
in
reality
that
first
night
sail
teemed
with
terrors
for
me
it
is
true
that
it
began
well
for
the
haze
dispersed
as
davies
had
prophesied
and
bulk
point
lighthouse
guided
us
safely
to
the
mouth
of
kiel
fiord
it
was
during
this
stage
that
crouching
together
aft
our
glowing
sympathetically
we
returned
to
the
problem
before
us
for
we
had
shot
out
on
our
quest
with
volcanic
precipitation
leaving
much
to
be
discussed
i
gleaned
a
few
more
facts
though
i
dispelled
no
doubts
davies
had
only
seen
the
dollmanns
on
their
yacht
where
father
and
daughter
were
living
for
the
time
their
villa
at
norderney
and
their
home
life
there
were
unknown
to
him
though
he
had
landed
once
at
the
harbour
himself
further
he
had
heard
vaguely
of
a
stepmother
absent
at
hamburg
they
were
to
have
joined
her
on
their
arrival
at
that
city
which
be
it
noted
stands
a
long
way
up
the
elbe
forty
miles
and
more
above
cuxhaven
the
town
at
the
mouth
the
exact
arrangement
made
on
the
day
before
the
fatal
voyage
was
that
the
two
yachts
should
meet
in
the
evening
at
cuxhaven
and
proceed
up
the
river
together
then
in
the
ordinary
course
davies
would
have
parted
company
at
brunsb√ºttel
fifteen
miles
up
which
is
the
western
terminus
of
the
ship
canal
to
the
baltic
such
at
least
had
been
his
original
intention
but
putting
two
and
two
together
i
gathered
that
latterly
and
perhaps
unconfessed
to
himself
his
resolve
had
weakened
and
that
he
would
have
followed
the
to
hamburg
or
indeed
the
end
of
the
world
impelled
by
the
same
motive
that
contrary
to
all
his
tastes
and
principles
had
induced
him
to
abandon
his
life
in
the
islands
and
undertake
the
voyage
at
all
but
on
that
point
he
was
immovably
reticent
and
all
i
could
conclude
was
that
the
strange
connected
with
dollmann
daughter
had
given
him
cruel
pain
and
had
clouded
his
judgement
to
distraction
but
that
he
now
was
prepared
to
forget
or
ignore
it
and
steer
a
settled
course
the
facts
i
elicited
raised
several
important
questions
was
it
not
known
by
this
time
that
he
and
his
yacht
had
survived
davies
was
convinced
that
it
was
not
may
have
waited
at
cuxhaven
or
inquired
at
the
lock
at
brunsb√ºttel
he
said
there
was
no
need
for
i
tell
you
the
thing
was
a
certainty
if
i
had
struck
and
on
that
outer
bank
as
it
was
a
hundred
to
one
i
should
do
the
yacht
would
have
broken
up
in
three
minutes
bartels
would
never
have
seen
me
and
could
have
got
to
me
if
he
had
no
one
would
have
seen
me
and
nothing
whatever
has
happened
since
to
show
that
they
know
i
alive
i
suggested
are
they
who
are
our
adversaries
if
dollmann
were
an
accredited
agent
of
the
german
admiralty
but
no
it
was
incredible
that
the
murder
of
a
young
englishman
should
be
connived
at
in
modern
days
by
a
friendly
and
civilized
government
yet
if
he
were
not
such
an
agent
the
whole
theory
fell
to
the
ground
believe
said
davies
dollmann
did
it
off
his
own
bat
and
beyond
that
i
ca
see
and
i
do
know
that
it
matters
at
present
alive
or
dead
we
doing
nothing
wrong
and
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
think
it
matters
a
good
deal
i
objected
will
be
interested
in
our
resurrection
and
how
are
we
to
go
to
work
openly
or
secretly
i
suppose
we
shall
keep
out
of
the
way
as
much
as
we
can
for
keeping
out
of
the
way
said
davies
jerkily
as
he
peered
to
windward
under
the
foresail
pass
the
ship
canal
that
a
public
highway
where
anyone
can
see
you
after
that
there
wo
be
much
difficulty
wait
till
you
see
the
place
he
gave
a
low
contented
laugh
which
would
have
frozen
my
marrow
yesterday
the
way
that
reminds
me
he
added
must
stop
at
kiel
for
the
inside
of
a
day
and
lay
in
a
lot
of
stores
we
want
to
be
independent
of
the
shore
i
said
nothing
independence
of
the
shore
in
a
in
october
what
an
end
to
aim
at
about
nine
we
weathered
the
point
entered
kiel
fiord
and
began
a
dead
beat
to
windward
of
seven
miles
to
the
head
of
it
where
kiel
lies
hitherto
save
for
the
latent
qualms
concerning
my
total
helplessness
if
anything
happened
to
davies
interest
and
excitement
had
upheld
me
well
my
alarms
only
began
when
i
thought
them
nearly
over
davies
had
frequently
urged
me
to
turn
in
and
sleep
and
i
went
so
far
as
to
go
below
and
coil
myself
up
on
the
lee
sofa
with
my
pencil
and
diary
suddenly
there
was
a
flapping
and
rattling
on
deck
and
i
began
to
slide
on
to
the
floor
happened
i
cried
in
a
panic
for
there
was
davies
stooping
in
at
the
cabin
door
he
said
chafing
his
hands
for
warmth
only
going
about
hand
me
the
glasses
will
you
there
a
steamer
ahead
i
say
if
you
really
do
want
to
turn
in
you
might
make
some
soup
just
let
look
at
the
chart
he
studied
it
with
maddening
deliberation
while
i
wondered
how
near
the
steamer
was
and
what
the
yacht
was
doing
meanwhile
suppose
it
not
really
necessary
for
anyone
to
be
at
the
helm
i
remarked
she
all
right
for
a
minute
he
said
without
looking
up
one
and
a
half
one
lights
in
line
by
west
got
a
match
he
expended
two
and
tumbled
upstairs
again
do
want
me
do
you
i
shouted
after
him
but
come
up
when
you
put
the
kettle
on
it
a
pretty
beat
up
the
fiord
lovely
breeze
his
legs
disappeared
a
sort
of
buoyant
fatalism
possessed
me
as
i
finished
my
notes
and
pored
over
the
stove
it
upheld
me
too
when
i
went
on
deck
and
watched
the
beat
whose
prettiness
was
mainly
due
to
the
crowd
of
shipping
steamers
smacks
and
now
once
more
on
the
move
in
the
confined
fairway
of
the
fiord
their
baleful
eyes
of
red
green
or
yellow
opening
and
shutting
brightening
and
fading
while
and
added
to
my
bewilderment
and
a
throbbing
of
screws
filled
the
air
like
the
distant
roar
of
london
streets
in
fact
every
time
we
spun
round
for
our
dart
across
the
fiord
i
felt
like
a
rustic
matron
gathering
her
skirts
for
the
transit
of
the
strand
on
a
busy
night
davies
however
was
the
street
arab
who
zigzags
under
the
horses
feet
unscathed
and
all
the
time
he
discoursed
placidly
on
the
simplicity
and
safety
of
if
only
you
are
careful
obeying
rules
and
burnt
good
lights
as
we
were
nearing
the
hot
glow
in
the
sky
that
denoted
kiel
we
passed
a
huge
scintillating
bulk
moored
in
he
murmured
ecstatically
at
one
we
anchored
off
the
town
x
his
chance
say
davies
i
said
long
do
you
think
this
trip
will
last
i
only
got
a
month
leave
we
were
standing
at
slanting
desks
in
the
kiel
davies
scratching
diligently
at
his
and
i
staring
feebly
at
mine
jove
said
davies
with
a
start
of
dismay
only
three
weeks
more
i
never
thought
of
that
you
could
manage
to
get
an
extension
could
you
can
write
to
the
chief
i
admitted
where
the
answer
to
come
to
we
better
without
an
address
i
suppose
cuxhaven
reflected
davies
that
too
near
and
there
but
we
do
want
to
be
tied
down
to
landing
anywhere
i
tell
you
what
say
post
office
norderney
just
your
name
not
the
yacht
we
get
there
and
be
able
to
call
for
letters
the
casual
character
of
our
adventure
never
struck
me
more
strongly
than
then
that
what
doing
i
asked
i
sha
be
having
important
letters
like
you
what
are
you
saying
just
that
we
having
a
splendid
cruise
and
are
on
our
way
home
the
notion
tickled
me
and
i
said
the
same
in
my
home
letter
adding
that
we
were
looking
for
a
friend
of
davies
who
would
be
able
to
show
us
some
sport
i
wrote
a
line
too
to
my
chief
unaware
of
the
gravity
of
the
step
i
was
taking
saying
it
was
possible
that
i
might
have
to
apply
for
longer
leave
as
i
had
important
business
to
transact
in
germany
and
asking
him
kindly
to
write
to
the
same
address
then
we
shouldered
our
parcels
and
resumed
our
business
two
full
of
stores
we
ferried
to
the
chief
among
which
were
two
immense
cans
of
petroleum
constituting
our
reserves
of
heat
and
light
and
a
sack
of
flour
there
were
spare
ropes
and
blocks
too
german
charts
of
excellent
quality
cigars
and
many
weird
brands
of
sausage
and
tinned
meats
besides
a
miscellany
of
oddments
some
of
which
only
served
in
the
end
to
slake
my
companion
craving
for
jettison
clothes
were
my
own
chief
care
for
freely
as
i
had
purged
it
at
flensburg
my
wardrobe
was
still
very
unsuitable
and
i
had
already
irretrievably
damaged
two
faultless
pairs
of
white
flannels
shall
be
able
to
throw
them
overboard
said
davies
hopefully
so
i
bought
a
great
pair
of
seaboots
of
the
country
and
and
both
of
us
got
a
number
of
rough
woollen
garments
as
worn
by
the
local
fishermen
breeches
jerseys
helmets
gloves
all
of
a
colour
chosen
to
harmonize
with
paraffin
stains
and
anchor
mud
the
same
evening
we
were
taking
our
last
look
at
the
baltic
sailing
past
warships
and
groups
of
idle
yachts
battened
down
for
their
winter
sleep
while
the
noble
shores
of
the
fiord
with
its
villas
embowered
in
copper
foliage
grew
dark
and
dim
above
us
we
rounded
the
last
headland
steered
for
a
galaxy
of
coloured
lights
tumbled
down
our
sails
and
came
to
under
the
colossal
gates
of
the
holtenau
lock
that
these
would
open
to
such
an
infinitesimal
suppliant
seemed
inconceivable
but
open
they
did
with
ponderous
majesty
and
our
tiny
hull
was
lost
in
the
womb
of
a
lock
designed
to
float
the
largest
battleships
i
thought
of
boulter
on
a
hot
august
sunday
and
wondered
if
i
really
was
the
same
peevish
dandy
who
had
jostled
and
sweltered
there
with
the
noisy
cockney
throng
a
month
ago
there
was
a
blaze
of
electricity
overhead
but
utter
silence
till
a
solitary
cloaked
figure
hailed
us
and
called
for
the
captain
davies
ran
up
a
ladder
disappeared
with
the
cloaked
figure
and
returned
crumpling
a
paper
into
his
pocket
it
lies
before
me
now
and
sets
forth
under
the
stamp
of
the
k√∂nigliches
zollamt
that
in
consideration
of
the
sum
of
ten
marks
for
dues
and
four
for
tonnage
an
imperial
tug
would
tow
the
vessel
master
davies
through
the
kaiser
wilhelm
canal
from
holtenau
to
brunsb√ºttel
magnificent
condescension
i
blush
when
i
look
at
this
yellow
document
and
remember
the
stately
courtesy
of
the
great
for
the
sleepy
officials
of
the
k√∂nigliches
zollamt
little
knew
what
an
insidious
little
viper
they
were
admitting
into
the
imperial
bosom
at
the
light
toll
of
fourteen
shillings
cheap
said
davies
joining
me
it
they
a
regular
tariff
on
tonnage
same
for
yachts
as
for
liners
we
start
at
four
with
a
lot
of
other
boats
i
wonder
if
bartels
is
here
the
same
silence
reigned
but
invisible
forces
were
at
work
the
inner
gates
opened
and
we
prised
ourselves
through
into
a
capacious
basin
where
lay
moored
side
by
side
a
flotilla
of
sailing
vessels
of
various
sizes
having
made
fast
alongside
a
vacant
space
of
quay
we
had
our
dinner
and
then
strolled
out
with
cigars
to
look
for
the
we
found
her
wedged
among
a
stack
of
galliots
and
her
skipper
sitting
primly
below
before
a
blazing
stove
reading
his
bible
through
spectacles
he
produced
a
bottle
of
schnapps
and
some
very
small
and
hard
pears
while
davies
twitted
him
mercilessly
about
his
false
predictions
sky
was
not
good
was
all
he
said
beaming
indulgently
at
his
incorrigible
young
friend
before
parting
for
the
night
it
was
arranged
that
next
morning
we
should
lash
alongside
the
when
the
flotilla
was
marshalled
for
the
tow
through
the
canal
shall
steer
for
us
both
he
said
we
will
stay
warm
in
the
cabin
the
scheme
was
carried
out
not
without
much
confusion
and
loss
of
paint
in
the
small
hours
of
a
dark
and
drizzling
morning
boisterous
little
tugs
sorted
us
into
parties
and
half
lost
under
the
massive
bulwarks
of
the
we
were
carried
off
into
a
black
inane
if
any
doubt
remained
as
to
the
significance
of
our
change
of
dawn
dispelled
it
view
there
was
none
from
the
deck
of
the
it
was
only
by
standing
on
the
mainboom
that
you
could
see
over
the
embankments
to
the
vast
plain
of
holstein
grey
and
monotonous
under
a
pall
of
mist
the
soft
scenery
of
the
schleswig
coast
was
a
baseless
dream
of
the
past
and
a
cold
penetrating
rain
added
the
last
touch
of
dramatic
completeness
to
the
staging
of
the
new
act
for
two
days
we
travelled
slowly
up
the
mighty
waterway
that
is
the
strategic
link
between
the
two
seas
of
germany
broad
and
straight
massively
embanked
lit
by
electricity
at
night
till
it
is
lighter
than
many
a
great
london
street
traversed
by
great
war
vessels
rich
merchantmen
and
humble
coasters
alike
it
is
a
symbol
of
the
new
and
mighty
force
which
controlled
by
the
genius
of
statesmen
and
engineers
is
thrusting
the
empire
irresistibly
forward
to
the
goal
of
maritime
greatness
it
splendid
said
davies
a
fine
fellow
that
emperor
karl
was
the
boy
of
about
sixteen
who
constituted
the
whole
crew
of
the
and
was
as
dirty
as
his
master
was
clean
i
felt
a
certain
envious
reverence
for
this
unprepossessing
youth
seeing
in
him
a
much
more
efficient
counterpart
of
myself
but
how
he
and
his
little
master
ever
managed
to
work
their
ungainly
vessel
was
a
miracle
i
never
understood
phlegmatically
impervious
to
rain
and
cold
he
steered
the
down
the
long
grey
reaches
in
the
wake
of
the
tug
while
we
and
bartels
held
snug
gatherings
down
below
sometimes
in
his
cabin
sometimes
in
ours
the
heating
arrangements
of
the
latter
began
to
be
a
subject
of
serious
concern
we
finally
did
the
only
logical
thing
and
brought
the
into
the
parlour
fixing
the
rippingille
stove
on
the
forward
end
of
the
cabin
table
where
it
could
warm
as
well
as
cook
for
us
as
an
ornament
it
was
monstrous
and
the
taint
of
oil
which
it
introduced
was
a
disgusting
drawback
but
after
all
the
great
thing
as
davies
said
is
to
be
comfortable
and
after
that
to
be
clean
davies
held
long
consultations
with
bartels
who
was
thoroughly
at
home
in
the
navigation
of
the
sands
we
were
bound
for
his
own
boat
being
a
type
of
the
very
craft
which
ply
in
them
i
shall
not
forget
the
moment
when
it
first
dawned
on
him
that
his
young
curiosity
was
practical
for
he
had
thought
that
our
goal
was
his
own
beloved
hamburg
queen
of
cities
a
place
to
see
and
die
is
too
late
he
wailed
do
not
know
the
nord
see
as
i
do
nonsense
bartels
it
quite
safe
and
have
i
not
found
you
fast
on
hohenh√∂rn
in
a
storm
with
your
rudder
broken
god
was
good
to
you
then
my
son
but
it
was
my
f
davies
checked
himself
going
home
there
nothing
in
that
bartels
became
sadly
resigned
is
good
that
you
have
a
friend
was
his
last
word
on
the
subject
but
all
the
same
he
always
glanced
at
me
with
a
rather
doubtful
eye
as
to
davies
and
myself
our
friendship
developed
quickly
on
certain
limited
lines
the
chief
obstacle
as
i
well
know
now
being
his
reluctance
to
talk
about
the
personal
side
of
our
quest
on
the
other
hand
i
spoke
about
my
own
life
and
interests
with
an
unsparing
discernment
of
which
i
should
have
been
incapable
a
month
ago
and
in
return
i
gained
the
key
to
his
own
character
it
was
devotion
to
the
sea
wedded
to
a
fire
of
patriotism
struggling
incessantly
for
an
outlet
in
strenuous
physical
expression
a
humanity
born
of
acute
sensitiveness
to
his
own
limitations
only
adding
fuel
to
the
flame
i
learnt
for
the
first
time
now
that
in
early
youth
he
had
failed
for
the
navy
the
first
of
several
failures
in
his
career
i
ca
settle
down
to
anything
else
he
said
read
no
end
about
it
and
yet
i
am
a
useless
outsider
all
i
been
able
to
do
is
to
potter
about
in
small
boats
but
it
all
been
till
this
chance
came
i
afraid
not
understand
how
i
feel
about
it
but
at
last
for
once
in
a
way
i
see
a
chance
of
being
useful
ought
to
be
chances
for
chaps
like
you
i
said
the
accident
of
a
job
such
as
this
as
long
as
i
get
it
what
matter
but
i
know
what
you
mean
there
must
be
hundreds
of
chaps
like
me
i
know
a
good
many
myself
who
know
our
coasts
like
a
book
shoals
creeks
tides
rocks
there
nothing
in
it
it
only
practice
they
ought
to
make
some
use
of
us
as
a
naval
reserve
they
tried
to
once
but
it
fizzled
out
and
nobody
really
cares
and
what
the
result
using
every
man
of
what
reserves
we
got
there
about
enough
to
man
the
fleet
on
a
war
footing
and
no
more
they
tinkered
with
fishermen
and
merchant
sailors
and
yachting
hands
but
everyone
of
them
ought
to
be
got
hold
of
and
the
colonies
too
is
there
the
ghost
of
a
doubt
that
if
war
broke
out
there
be
wild
appeals
for
volunteers
aimless
cadging
hurry
confusion
waste
my
own
idea
is
that
we
ought
to
go
much
further
and
train
every
man
for
a
couple
of
years
as
a
sailor
army
oh
i
suppose
you
have
to
give
them
the
choice
not
that
i
know
or
care
much
about
the
army
though
to
listen
to
people
talk
you
think
it
really
mattered
as
the
navy
matters
a
maritime
nation
we
grown
by
the
sea
and
live
by
it
if
we
lose
command
of
it
we
starve
we
unique
in
that
way
just
as
our
huge
empire
only
linked
by
the
sea
is
unique
and
yet
read
brassey
dilke
and
those
and
see
what
mountains
of
apathy
and
conceit
have
had
to
be
tackled
it
not
the
people
fault
we
been
safe
so
long
and
grown
so
rich
that
we
forgotten
what
we
owe
it
to
but
there
no
excuse
for
those
blockheads
of
statesmen
as
they
call
themselves
who
are
paid
to
see
things
as
they
are
they
have
to
go
to
an
american
to
learn
their
a
b
c
and
it
only
when
kicked
and
punched
by
civilian
agitators
a
mere
handful
of
men
who
get
sneered
at
for
their
pains
that
they
wake
up
do
some
work
point
proudly
to
it
and
go
to
sleep
again
till
they
get
another
kick
by
jove
we
want
a
man
like
this
kaiser
who
does
wait
to
be
kicked
but
works
like
a
nigger
for
his
country
and
sees
ahead
improving
are
we
of
course
we
are
but
it
a
constant
uphill
fight
and
we
are
ready
they
talk
of
a
standard
he
plunged
away
into
regions
where
space
forbids
me
to
follow
him
this
is
only
a
sample
of
many
similar
conversations
that
we
afterwards
held
always
culminating
in
the
burning
question
of
germany
far
from
including
me
and
the
foreign
office
among
his
targets
for
vague
invective
he
had
a
profound
respect
for
my
sagacity
and
experience
as
a
member
of
that
institution
a
respect
which
embarrassed
me
not
a
little
when
i
thought
of
my
writing
and
my
dancing
and
my
dining
but
i
did
know
something
of
germany
and
could
satisfy
his
tireless
questioning
with
a
certain
authority
he
used
to
listen
rapt
while
i
described
her
marvellous
awakening
in
the
last
generation
under
the
strength
and
wisdom
of
her
rulers
her
intense
patriotic
ardour
her
seething
industrial
activity
and
most
potent
of
all
the
forces
that
are
moulding
modern
europe
her
dream
of
a
colonial
empire
entailing
her
transformation
from
a
to
a
impregnably
based
on
vast
territorial
resources
which
we
can
not
molest
the
dim
instincts
of
her
people
not
merely
directed
but
anticipated
by
the
genius
of
her
ruling
house
our
great
trade
rivals
of
the
present
our
great
naval
rival
of
the
future
she
grows
and
strengthens
and
waits
an
ever
more
formidable
factor
in
the
future
of
our
delicate
network
of
empire
sensitive
as
gossamer
to
external
shocks
and
radiating
from
an
island
whose
commerce
is
its
life
and
which
depends
even
for
its
daily
ration
of
bread
on
the
free
passage
of
the
seas
we
are
ready
for
her
davies
would
say
do
look
her
way
we
have
no
naval
base
in
the
north
sea
and
no
north
sea
fleet
our
best
battleships
are
too
deep
in
draught
for
north
sea
work
and
to
crown
all
we
were
asses
enough
to
give
her
heligoland
which
commands
her
north
sea
coast
and
supposing
she
collars
holland
is
there
some
talk
of
that
that
would
lead
me
to
describe
the
swollen
ambitions
of
the
party
and
its
ceaseless
intrigues
to
promote
the
absorption
of
austria
switzerland
and
a
direct
and
flagrant
menace
to
ourselves
of
holland
do
blame
them
said
davies
who
for
all
his
patriotism
had
not
a
particle
of
racial
spleen
in
his
composition
do
blame
them
their
rhine
ceases
to
be
german
just
when
it
begins
to
be
most
valuable
the
mouth
is
dutch
and
would
give
them
magnificent
ports
just
opposite
british
shores
ca
talk
about
conquest
and
grabbing
we
collared
a
fine
share
of
the
world
and
they
every
right
to
be
jealous
let
them
hate
us
and
say
so
it
teach
us
to
buck
up
and
that
what
really
matters
in
these
talks
there
occurred
a
singular
contact
of
minds
it
was
very
well
for
me
to
spin
sonorous
generalities
but
i
had
never
till
now
dreamed
of
being
so
vulgar
as
to
translate
them
into
practice
i
had
always
detested
the
meddlesome
alarmist
who
veils
ignorance
under
noisiness
and
for
ever
wails
his
chant
of
lugubrious
pessimism
to
be
thrown
with
davies
was
to
receive
a
shock
of
enlightenment
for
here
at
least
was
a
specimen
of
the
breed
who
exacted
respect
it
is
true
he
made
use
of
the
usual
jargon
interlarding
his
stammering
sentences
sometimes
when
he
was
excited
with
the
oddest
effect
with
the
conventional
catchwords
of
the
journalist
and
platform
speaker
but
these
were
but
accidents
for
he
seemed
to
have
caught
his
innermost
conviction
from
the
very
soul
of
the
sea
itself
an
armchair
critic
is
one
thing
but
a
sunburnt
zealot
smarting
under
a
personal
discontent
athirst
for
a
means
however
tortuous
of
contributing
his
effort
to
the
great
cause
the
maritime
supremacy
of
britain
that
was
quite
another
thing
he
drew
inspiration
from
the
very
wind
and
spray
he
communed
with
his
tiller
i
believe
and
marshalled
his
figures
with
its
help
to
hear
him
talk
was
to
feel
a
current
of
clarifying
air
blustering
into
a
close
where
men
bandy
ineffectual
platitudes
and
mumble
old
shibboleths
and
go
away
and
do
nothing
in
our
talk
about
policy
and
strategy
we
were
bismarcks
and
rodneys
wielding
nations
and
navies
and
indeed
i
have
no
doubt
that
our
fancy
took
extravagant
flights
sometimes
in
plain
fact
we
were
merely
two
young
gentlemen
in
a
pleasure
boat
with
a
taste
for
amateur
hydrography
and
police
duty
combined
not
that
davies
ever
doubted
once
set
on
the
road
he
gripped
his
purpose
with
faith
and
tenacity
it
was
his
xi
the
pathfinders
in
the
late
afternoon
of
the
second
day
our
flotilla
reached
the
elbe
at
brunsb√ºttel
and
ranged
up
in
the
inner
basin
while
a
big
liner
whimpering
like
a
fretful
baby
was
tenderly
nursed
into
the
lock
during
the
delay
davies
left
me
in
charge
and
bolted
off
with
an
and
a
an
official
in
uniform
was
passing
along
the
quay
from
vessel
to
vessel
countersigning
papers
i
went
up
to
meet
him
with
our
receipt
for
dues
which
he
signed
carelessly
then
he
paused
and
muttered
scratching
his
head
was
the
name
english
he
asked
that
is
so
there
was
an
inquiry
for
you
from
friend
of
yours
from
a
big
i
know
she
went
on
to
hamburg
i
suppose
such
luck
captain
she
was
outward
bound
what
did
the
man
mean
he
seemed
to
be
vastly
amused
by
something
was
this
about
three
weeks
ago
i
asked
indifferently
weeks
it
was
the
day
before
yesterday
what
a
pity
to
miss
him
by
so
little
he
chuckled
and
winked
he
leave
any
message
i
asked
was
a
lady
who
inquired
whispered
the
fellow
sniggering
really
i
said
beginning
to
feel
highly
absurd
but
keenly
curious
she
inquired
about
the
she
was
difficult
to
satisfy
stood
over
me
while
i
searched
the
books
a
very
little
one
she
kept
saying
and
are
you
sure
all
the
names
are
here
i
saw
her
into
her
kleine
boot
and
she
rowed
away
in
the
rain
no
she
left
no
message
it
was
dirty
weather
for
a
young
fr√§ulein
to
be
out
alone
in
ach
she
was
safe
enough
though
to
see
her
crossing
the
ebb
in
a
chop
of
tide
was
a
treat
the
yacht
went
on
down
the
river
where
was
she
bound
to
do
i
know
bremen
wilhelmshaven
emden
somewhere
in
the
north
sea
too
far
for
you
do
know
about
that
said
i
bravely
you
will
not
follow
in
are
not
you
bound
to
hamburg
can
change
our
plans
it
seems
a
pity
to
have
missed
them
twice
captain
there
are
plenty
of
pretty
girls
in
hamburg
but
you
english
will
do
anything
well

he
moved
on
chuckling
to
the
next

davies
soon
returned
with
his
cans
and
an
armful
of
dark
rye
loaves
just
in

liner

through

to
jostle
into

growing

said
as
we
followed
the
throng
still
clinging
like
a
barnacle
to
the
side
of
the
we
spent
the
few
minutes
while
the
lock
was
emptied
in
a
farewell
talk
to
bartels
karl
had
hitched
their
main
halyards
on
to
the
windlass
and
was
grinding
at
it
in
an
of

his
shock
head
jerking
and
his
grubby
face
perspiring
then
the
opened
and
so
in
a
babel
of
shouting
whining
of
blocks
and
creaking
of
spars
our
whole
company
was
split
out
into
the
dingy
bosom
of
the
elbe
the
gathered
way
under
wind
and
tide
and
headed
for
midstream
a
last
shake
of
the
hand
and
bartels
reluctantly
slipped
the
and
we
drifted
apart
reise

it
was
no
time
for
regretful
gazing
for
the
was
sweeping
us
up
and
out
and
it
was
not
until
we
had
set
the
foresail
edged
into
a
shallow
bight
and
let
go
our
anchor
that
we
had
leisure
to
think
of
him
again
but
by
that
time
his
and
the
other
craft
were
shades
in
the
murky
east
we
swung
close
to
a
of
smooth
blue
mud
which
sloped
up
to
a
dyke
behind
lay
the
same
flat
country
colourless
humid
and
opposite
us
two
miles
away
scarcely
visible
in
the
deepening
twilight
ran
the
outline
of
a
similar
shore
between
rolled
the
turgid
elbe
styx
flowing
through
tartarus
i
thought
to
myself
recalling
some
of
our
baltic
anchorages
i
told
my
news
to
davies
as
soon
as
the
anchor
was
down
instinctively
leaving
the
sex
of
the
inquirer
to
the
last
as
my
informant
had
done
called
yesterday
he
interrupted
outward
bound
that
a
rum
thing
why
did
he
inquire
when
he
was
going
was
a
lady
and
i
drily
retailed
the
official
story
very
busy
with
a
the
while
all
square
now
are
we
i
ended
go
below
and
light
the
stove
davies
had
been
engaged
in
fixing
up
the
when
i
last
saw
him
he
was
still
so
engaged
but
motionless
the
lantern
under
his
left
arm
and
his
right
hand
grasping
the
forestay
and
the
lanyard
his
eyes
staring
fixedly
down
the
river
a
strange
look
in
his
face
half
exultant
half
perplexed
when
he
joined
me
and
spoke
he
seemed
to
be
concluding
a
difficult
argument
it
proves
he
said
the
has
gone
back
to
norderney
that
the
main
thing
i
agreed
let
sum
up
all
we
know
first
certain
that
nobody
we
met
as
yet
has
any
suspicion
of
told
you
he
did
it
off
his
own
bat
threw
in
davies
secondly
of
if
he
what
you
think
it
not
known
here
ca
help
that
he
inquires
for
you
on
his
way
from
hamburg
three
weeks
after
the
event
it
does
look
as
if
he
thought
he
had
disposed
of
you
it
does
look
as
if
he
had
to
dispose
of
you
he
sends
his
daughter
too
a
curious
proceeding
under
the
circumstances
perhaps
it
all
a
mistake
not
a
mistake
said
davies
half
to
himself
he
send
her
he
have
sent
one
of
his
men
he
ca
be
on
board
at
all
this
was
a
new
light
do
you
mean
i
asked
must
have
left
the
yacht
when
he
got
to
hamburg
some
other
devil
work
i
suppose
she
being
sailed
back
now
and
passing
here
i
see
it
a
private
supplementary
inquiry
a
long
name
to
call
it
the
girl
sail
back
alone
with
the
crew
used
to
the
sea
and
perhaps
she
is
alone
there
was
that
stepmother
but
it
does
make
a
of
difference
to
our
plans
we
start
on
the
ebb
morning
we
were
busier
than
usual
that
night
reckoning
stores
tidying
lockers
and
securing
movables
must
economize
said
davies
for
all
the
world
as
though
we
were
castaways
on
a
raft
a
wretched
thing
to
have
to
land
somewhere
to
buy
oil
was
a
favourite
observation
of
his
before
getting
to
sleep
i
was
made
to
recognize
a
new
factor
in
the
conditions
of
navigation
now
that
the
tideless
baltic
was
left
behind
us
a
strong
current
was
sluicing
past
our
sides
and
at
the
eleventh
hour
i
was
turned
out
clad
in
pyjamas
and
oilskins
a
horrible
combination
to
assist
in
running
out
a
kedge
or
spare
anchor
i
asked
when
we
were
tucked
up
again
it
when
you
run
aground
you
have
to
but
you
soon
learn
all
about
it
i
steeled
my
heart
for
the
morrow
so
behold
us
then
at
eight
on
october
standing
down
the
river
towards
the
field
of
our
first
labours
it
is
fifteen
miles
to
the
mouth
drab
dreary
miles
like
the
dullest
reaches
of
the
lower
thames
but
scenery
was
of
no
concern
to
us
and
a
breeze
blowing
out
of
a
grey
sky
kept
us
constantly
on
the
verge
of
reefing
the
tide
as
it
gathered
strength
swept
us
down
with
a
force
attested
by
the
speed
with
which
buoys
came
in
sight
nodded
above
us
and
passed
each
boiling
in
its
eddy
of
dirty
foam
i
scarcely
noticed
at
first
so
calm
was
the
water
and
so
regular
were
the
buoys
like
milestones
along
a
road
that
the
northern
line
of
coast
was
rapidly
receding
and
that
the
was
coming
to
be
but
a
belt
of
deep
water
skirting
a
vast
estuary
three
seven
ten
miles
broad
till
it
merged
in
open
sea
we
at
sea
i
suddenly
exclaimed
an
hour
sailing
discovered
that
said
davies
laughing
said
it
was
fifteen
miles
i
complained
it
is
till
we
reach
this
coast
at
cuxhaven
but
i
suppose
you
may
say
we
at
sea
of
course
that
all
sand
over
there
to
starboard
look
some
of
it
showing
already
he
pointed
into
the
north
looking
more
attentively
i
noticed
that
outside
the
line
of
buoys
patches
of
the
surface
heaved
and
worked
in
one
or
two
places
streaks
and
circles
of
white
were
forming
in
the
midst
of
one
such
circle
a
sleek
mauve
hump
had
risen
like
the
back
of
a
sleeping
whale
i
saw
that
an
old
spell
was
enthralling
davies
as
his
eye
travelled
away
to
the
blank
horizon
he
scanned
it
all
with
a
critical
eagerness
too
as
one
who
looks
for
a
new
meaning
in
an
old
friend
face
something
of
his
zest
was
communicated
to
me
and
stilled
the
shuddering
thrill
that
had
seized
me
the
protecting
land
was
still
a
comforting
neighbour
but
our
severance
with
it
came
quickly
the
tide
whirled
us
down
and
our
straining
canvas
aiding
it
we
were
soon
off
cuxhaven
which
crouched
so
low
behind
its
mighty
dyke
that
of
some
of
its
houses
only
the
chimneys
were
visible
then
a
mile
or
so
on
the
shore
sharpened
to
a
point
like
a
claw
where
the
innocent
dyke
became
a
long
low
fort
with
some
great
guns
peeping
over
then
of
a
sudden
it
ceased
retreating
into
the
far
south
in
a
dim
perspective
of
groins
and
dunes
we
spun
out
into
the
open
and
leant
heavily
over
to
the
now
unobstructed
wind
the
yacht
rose
and
sank
to
a
little
swell
but
my
first
impression
was
one
of
wonder
at
the
calmness
of
the
sea
for
the
wind
blew
fresh
and
free
from
horizon
to
horizon
it
all
sand
now
and
we
under
the
lee
of
it
said
davies
with
an
enthusiastic
sweep
of
his
hand
over
the
sea
on
our
left
or
port
hand
our
hunting
ground
are
we
going
to
do
i
inquired
up
sticker
gat
was
the
reply
ought
to
be
near
buoy
a
red
buoy
with
a
huge
k
on
it
soon
came
into
view
davies
peered
over
to
port
pull
up
the
centreboard
will
you
he
remarked
abstractedly
adding
hand
me
up
the
glasses
as
you
are
down
there
mind
the
glasses
i
got
it
now
come
to
the
was
the
next
remark
he
put
down
the
helm
and
headed
the
yacht
straight
for
the
troubled
and
discoloured
expanse
which
covered
the
submerged
sands
a
whale
with
a
light
surf
splashing
on
it
was
right
in
our
path
by
the
lead
will
you
said
davies
politely
manage
the
sheets
it
a
dead
beat
in
ready
about
the
wind
was
in
our
teeth
now
and
for
a
crowded
we
wormed
ourselves
forward
by
tacks
into
the
sinuous
recesses
of
a
channel
which
threaded
the
shallows
westward
i
knelt
in
a
tangle
of
line
and
under
the
hazy
impression
that
something
very
critical
was
going
on
plied
the
lead
furiously
bumping
and
splashing
myself
and
shouting
out
the
depths
which
lessened
steadily
with
a
great
sense
of
the
importance
of
my
function
davies
never
seemed
to
listen
but
tacked
on
imperturbably
juggling
with
the
tiller
the
sheets
and
the
chart
in
a
way
that
made
one
giddy
to
look
at
for
all
our
zeal
we
seemed
to
be
making
very
slow
progress
no
use
tide
too
strong
we
must
chance
it
he
said
at
last
what
i
wondered
to
myself
our
tacks
suddenly
began
to
grow
longer
and
the
depths
which
i
registered
shallower
all
went
well
for
some
time
though
and
we
made
better
progress
then
came
a
longer
reach
than
usual
and
a
half
two
one
and
a
half
one
only
five
feet
i
gasped
reproachfully
the
water
was
growing
thick
and
frothy
does
matter
if
we
do
said
davies
thinking
aloud
an
eddy
here
and
it
a
pity
to
waste
it
ready
about
back
the
jib
but
it
was
too
late
the
yacht
answered
but
faintly
to
the
helm
stopped
and
heeled
heavily
over
wallowing
and
grinding
davies
had
the
mainsail
down
in
a
twinkling
it
half
smothered
me
as
i
crouched
on
the
among
my
tangled
skeins
of
line
scared
and
helpless
i
crawled
out
from
the
folds
and
saw
him
standing
by
the
mast
in
a
reverie
not
much
use
he
said
a
falling
tide
but
we
try
pay
that
warp
out
while
i
run
out
the
kedge
like
lightning
he
had
cast
off
the
dinghy
painter
tumbled
the
and
himself
into
the
dinghy
pulled
out
fifty
yards
into
the
deeper
water
and
heaved
out
the
anchor
haul
he
shouted
i
hauled
beginning
to
see
what
meant
on
do
sweat
yourself
said
davies
jumping
aboard
again
coming
i
spluttered
triumphantly
warp
is
the
yacht
is
you
dragging
the
anchor
home
never
mind
she
lie
well
here
let
have
lunch
the
yacht
was
motionless
and
the
water
round
her
visibly
lower
petulant
waves
slapped
against
her
sides
but
scattered
as
my
senses
were
i
realized
that
there
was
no
vestige
of
danger
round
us
the
whole
face
of
the
waters
was
changing
from
moment
to
moment
whitening
in
some
places
yellowing
in
others
where
breadths
of
sand
began
to
be
exposed
close
on
our
right
the
channel
we
had
left
began
to
look
like
a
turbid
little
river
and
i
understood
why
our
progress
had
been
so
slow
when
i
saw
its
current
racing
back
to
meet
the
elbe
davies
was
already
below
laying
out
a
more
than
usually
elaborate
lunch
in
high
content
of
mind
quiet
does
she
he
remarked
you
want
a
lunch
there
nothing
like
running
aground
for
it
and
anyhow
we
as
handy
for
work
here
as
anywhere
else
you
see
like
most
landsmen
i
had
a
wholesome
prejudice
against
running
aground
so
that
my
mentor
turn
for
breezy
paradox
was
at
first
rather
exasperating
after
lunch
the
chart
of
the
estuaries
was
brought
down
and
we
pored
over
it
together
mapping
out
work
for
the
next
few
days
there
is
no
need
to
tire
the
general
reader
with
its
intricacies
nor
is
there
space
to
reproduce
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
instructed
reader
for
both
classes
the
general
map
should
be
sufficient
taken
with
the
fragment
see
chart
a
which
gives
a
fair
example
of
the
region
in
detail
it
will
be
seen
that
the
three
broad
fairways
of
the
jade
weser
and
elbe
split
up
the
sands
into
two
main
groups
the
westernmost
of
these
is
symmetrical
in
outline
an
triangle
very
like
a
sharp
pike
if
you
imagine
the
peninsula
from
which
it
springs
to
be
the
wooden
haft
the
other
is
a
huge
congeries
of
banks
its
base
resting
on
the
hanover
coast
two
of
its
sides
tolerably
clean
and
even
and
the
third
that
facing
the
ribboned
and
lacerated
by
the
fury
of
the
sea
which
has
eaten
out
deep
cavities
and
struck
hungry
tentacles
far
into
the
interior
the
whole
resembles
an
inverted
e
or
better
still
a
rude
fork
on
whose
three
deadly
prongs
the
scharhorn
reef
the
knecht
sand
and
the
tegeler
flat
as
on
the
no
less
deadly
point
of
the
pike
many
a
good
ship
splinters
herself
in
northerly
gales
following
this
simile
the
hohenh√∂rn
bank
where
davies
was
wrecked
is
one
of
those
that
lie
between
the
upper
and
middle
prongs
our
business
was
to
explore
the
pike
and
the
fork
and
the
channels
which
ramify
through
them
i
use
the
general
word
but
in
fact
they
differ
widely
in
character
and
are
called
in
german
by
various
names
balje
gat
loch
diep
rinne
for
my
purpose
i
need
only
divide
them
into
two
sorts
those
which
have
water
in
them
at
all
states
of
the
tide
and
those
which
have
not
which
dry
off
that
is
either
wholly
or
partly
at
davies
explained
that
the
latter
would
take
most
learning
and
were
to
be
our
chief
concern
because
they
were
the
the
connecting
links
between
the
estuaries
you
can
always
detect
them
on
the
chart
by
rows
of
little
strokes
denoting
that
is
to
say
poles
or
saplings
fixed
in
the
sand
to
mark
the
passage
the
strokes
of
course
are
only
conventional
signs
and
do
not
correspond
in
the
least
to
individual
which
are
far
too
numerous
and
complex
to
be
indicated
accurately
on
a
chart
even
of
the
largest
scale
the
same
applies
to
the
course
of
the
channels
themselves
whose
minor
meanderings
can
not
be
reproduced
it
was
on
the
edge
of
one
of
these
tidal
swatchways
that
the
yacht
was
now
lying
it
is
called
sticker
gat
and
you
can
not
miss
it
see
chart
a
if
you
carry
your
eye
westward
along
our
course
from
cuxhaven
it
was
so
davies
told
me
the
last
and
most
intricate
stage
of
the
cut
which
the
had
taken
on
that
memorable
day
a
stage
he
himself
had
never
reached
discussion
ended
we
went
on
deck
davies
arming
himself
with
a
notebook
binoculars
and
the
prismatic
compass
whose
use
to
map
the
angles
of
the
channels
was
at
last
apparent
this
is
what
i
saw
when
we
emerged
xii
my
initiation
the
yacht
lay
with
a
very
slight
heel
thanks
to
a
pair
of
small
on
her
bottom
in
a
sort
of
trough
she
had
dug
for
herself
so
that
she
was
still
ringed
with
a
few
inches
of
water
as
it
were
with
a
moat
for
miles
in
every
direction
lay
a
desert
of
sand
to
the
north
it
touched
the
horizon
and
was
only
broken
by
the
blue
dot
of
neuerk
island
and
its
lighthouse
to
the
east
it
seemed
also
to
stretch
to
infinity
but
the
smoke
of
a
steamer
showed
where
it
was
pierced
by
the
stream
of
the
elbe
to
the
south
it
ran
up
to
the
of
the
hanover
shore
only
to
the
west
was
its
outline
broken
by
any
vestiges
of
the
sea
it
had
risen
from
there
it
was
astir
with
crawling
white
filaments
knotted
confusedly
at
one
spot
in
the
whence
came
a
sibilant
murmur
like
the
hissing
of
many
snakes
desert
as
i
call
it
it
was
not
entirely
featureless
its
colour
varied
from
light
fawn
where
the
highest
levels
had
dried
in
the
wind
to
brown
or
deep
violet
where
it
was
still
wet
and
where
patches
of
mud
soiled
its
clean
bosom
here
and
there
were
pools
of
water
smitten
into
ripples
by
the
impotent
wind
here
and
there
it
was
speckled
by
shells
and
seaweed
and
close
to
us
beginning
to
bend
away
towards
that
hissing
knot
in
the
wound
our
poor
little
channel
mercilessly
exposed
as
a
stagnant
muddy
ditch
with
scarcely
a
foot
of
water
not
deep
enough
to
hide
our
small
which
perked
up
one
fluke
in
impudent
mockery
the
dull
hard
sky
the
wind
moaning
in
the
rigging
as
though
crying
in
despair
for
a
prey
that
had
escaped
it
made
the
scene
inexpressibly
forlorn
davies
scanned
it
with
gusto
for
a
moment
climbed
to
a
point
of
vantage
on
the
boom
and
swept
his
glasses
to
and
fro
along
the
course
of
the
channel
well
boomed
he
said
meditatively
one
or
two
are
very
much
out
by
jove
that
a
tricky
bend
there
he
took
a
bearing
with
the
compass
made
a
note
or
two
and
sprang
with
a
vigorous
leap
down
on
to
the
sand
this
i
may
say
was
the
only
way
of
ashore
that
he
really
liked
we
raced
off
as
fast
as
our
clumsy
would
let
us
and
followed
up
the
course
of
our
channel
to
the
west
reconnoitring
the
road
we
should
have
to
follow
when
the
tide
rose
only
way
to
learn
a
place
like
this
he
shouted
to
see
it
at
low
water
the
banks
are
dry
then
and
the
channels
are
plain
look
at
that
boom
he
stopped
and
pointed
contemptuously
all
out
of
place
i
suppose
the
channel
shifted
there
it
just
at
an
important
bend
too
if
you
took
it
as
a
guide
when
the
water
was
up
you
run
aground
would
be
very
useful
i
observed
hang
it
he
laughed
exploring
i
want
to
be
able
to
run
through
this
channel
without
a
mistake
we
will
next
time
he
stopped
and
plied
compass
and
notebook
then
we
raced
on
till
the
next
halt
was
called
he
said
the
channel
getting
deeper
it
was
nearly
dry
a
moment
ago
see
the
current
in
it
now
that
the
flood
tide
coming
up
from
the
mind
you
that
is
from
the
weser
side
that
shows
we
past
the
watershed
i
repeated
blankly
that
what
i
call
it
you
see
a
big
sand
such
as
this
is
like
a
range
of
hills
dividing
two
plains
it
never
dead
flat
though
it
looks
it
there
always
one
point
one
ridge
rather
where
highest
now
a
channel
cutting
right
through
the
sand
is
of
course
always
at
its
shallowest
when
it
crossing
this
ridge
at
low
water
it
generally
dry
there
and
it
gradually
deepens
as
it
gets
nearer
to
the
sea
on
either
side
now
at
high
tide
when
the
whole
sand
is
covered
the
water
can
travel
where
it
likes
but
directly
the
ebb
sets
in
the
water
falls
away
on
either
side
the
ridge
and
the
channel
becomes
two
rivers
flowing
in
opposite
directions
the
centre
or
watershed
as
i
call
it
so
also
when
the
ebb
has
run
out
and
the
flood
begins
the
channel
is
fed
by
two
currents
flowing
to
the
centre
and
meeting
in
the
middle
here
the
elbe
and
the
weser
are
our
two
feeders
now
this
current
here
is
going
eastwards
we
know
by
the
time
of
day
that
the
tide
rising
the
watershed
is
between
us
and
the
yacht
is
it
so
important
to
know
that
these
currents
are
strong
and
you
want
to
know
when
lose
a
fair
one
and
strike
a
foul
one
besides
the
ridge
is
the
critical
point
when
you
crossing
on
a
falling
tide
and
you
want
to
know
when
you
past
it
we
pushed
on
till
our
path
was
barred
by
a
big
lagoon
it
looked
far
more
imposing
than
the
channel
but
davies
after
a
rapid
scrutiny
treated
it
to
a
grunt
of
contempt
a
de
he
said
that
hump
of
sand
it
making
for
beyond
boomed
i
remonstrated
pointing
to
a
decrepit
stem
drooping
over
the
bank
and
shaking
a
palsied
finger
at
the
imposture
that
just
where
one
goes
wrong
it
an
old
cut
that
silted
up
that
boom
a
fraud
there
no
time
to
go
farther
the
making
fast
i
just
take
bearings
of
what
we
can
see
the
false
lagoon
was
the
first
of
several
that
began
to
be
visible
in
the
west
swelling
and
joining
hands
over
the
ribs
of
sand
that
divided
them
all
the
time
the
distant
hissing
grew
nearer
and
louder
and
a
deep
thunderous
note
began
to
sound
beneath
it
we
turned
our
backs
to
the
wind
and
hastened
back
towards
the
the
stream
in
our
channel
hurrying
and
rising
alongside
of
us
just
time
to
do
the
other
side
said
davies
when
we
reached
her
and
i
was
congratulating
myself
on
having
regained
our
base
without
finding
our
communications
cut
and
away
we
scurried
in
the
direction
we
had
come
that
morning
splashing
through
pools
and
jumping
the
infant
runnels
that
were
stealing
out
through
rifts
from
the
as
the
tide
rose
our
observations
completed
back
we
travelled
making
a
wide
circuit
over
higher
ground
to
avoid
the
encroaching
flood
and
wading
in
the
final
approach
to
the
yacht
as
i
scrambled
thankfully
aboard
i
seemed
to
hear
a
voice
saying
in
languid
depreciation
of
yachting
that
it
did
not
give
one
enough
exercise
it
was
mine
centuries
ago
in
another
life
from
east
and
west
two
sheets
of
water
had
overspread
the
desert
each
pushing
out
tongues
of
surf
that
met
and
fused
i
waited
on
deck
and
watched
the
of
the
suffocating
sands
under
the
relentless
onset
of
the
sea
the
last
strongholds
were
battered
stormed
and
overwhelmed
the
tumult
of
sounds
sank
and
steadied
and
the
sea
swept
victoriously
over
the
whole
expanse
the
hitherto
contemptuously
inert
began
to
wake
and
tremble
under
the
buffetings
she
received
then
with
an
effort
she
jerked
herself
on
to
an
even
keel
and
bumped
and
strained
fretfully
impatient
to
vanquish
this
insolent
invader
and
make
him
a
slave
for
her
own
ends
soon
her
warp
tightened
and
her
nose
swung
slowly
round
only
her
stern
bumped
now
and
that
with
decreasing
force
suddenly
she
was
free
and
drifting
broadside
to
the
wind
till
the
anchor
checked
her
and
she
brought
up
to
leeward
of
it
rocking
easily
and
triumphantly
little
person
at
heart
she
was
friends
alike
with
sand
and
sea
it
was
only
when
the
old
love
and
the
new
love
were
in
mortal
combat
for
her
favours
and
she
was
mauled
in
the
that
her
temper
rose
in
revolt
we
swallowed
a
hasty
cup
of
tea
ran
up
the
sails
and
started
off
west
again
once
across
the
we
met
a
strong
current
but
the
trend
of
the
passage
was
now
more
to
the
so
that
we
could
hold
our
course
without
tacking
and
consequently
could
stem
the
tide
her
just
a
foot
of
the
said
davies
know
the
way
here
and
she
make
less
leeway
but
we
shall
generally
have
to
do
without
it
always
on
a
falling
tide
if
you
run
aground
with
the
plate
down
you
deserve
to
be
drowned
i
now
saw
how
valuable
our
walk
had
been
the
booms
were
on
our
right
but
they
were
broken
reeds
giving
no
hint
as
to
the
breadth
of
the
channel
a
few
had
lost
their
tops
and
were
being
engulfed
altogether
by
the
rising
water
when
we
came
to
the
point
where
they
ceased
and
the
false
lagoon
had
lain
i
should
have
felt
utterly
lost
we
had
crossed
the
high
and
relatively
level
sands
which
form
the
base
of
the
fork
and
were
entering
the
labyrinth
of
detached
banks
which
obstruct
the
cavity
between
the
upper
and
middle
prongs
this
i
knew
from
the
chart
my
unaided
eye
saw
nothing
but
the
open
sea
growing
dark
green
as
the
depths
increased
a
dour
threatening
sea
showing
its
white
fangs
the
waves
grew
longer
and
steeper
for
the
channels
though
still
tortuous
now
begin
to
be
broad
and
deep
davies
had
his
bearings
and
struck
on
his
course
confidently
for
the
lead
he
said
compass
be
little
use
soon
we
must
feel
the
edge
of
the
sands
till
we
pick
up
more
booms
are
we
going
to
anchor
for
the
night
i
asked
the
hohenh√∂rn
said
davies
auld
lang
syne
partly
by
sight
and
mostly
by
touch
we
crept
round
the
outermost
alley
of
the
hidden
maze
till
a
new
clump
of
booms
appeared
meaningless
to
me
but
analysed
by
him
into
two
groups
one
we
followed
for
some
distance
and
then
struck
finally
away
and
began
another
beat
to
windward
dusk
was
falling
the
hanover
never
very
distinct
had
utterly
vanished
an
ominous
heave
of
swell
was
the
short
sea
i
ceased
to
attend
to
davies
imparting
instruction
on
his
beloved
hobby
and
sought
to
stifle
in
hard
manual
labour
the
dread
that
had
been
latent
in
me
all
day
at
the
prospect
of
our
first
anchorage
at
sea
like
blazes
now
he
said
at
last
i
came
to
a
fathom
and
a
half
the
bank
he
said
give
it
a
bit
of
a
berth
and
then
let
go
go
now
was
the
order
after
a
minute
and
the
chain
ran
out
with
a
moan
the
snubbed
up
to
it
and
jauntily
faced
the
north
sea
and
the
growing
night
we
are
said
davies
as
we
finished
stowing
the
mainsail
and
snug
in
four
fathoms
in
a
magnificent
with
no
one
to
bother
us
and
the
whole
of
it
to
ourselves
no
dues
no
stinks
no
traffic
no
worries
of
any
sort
it
better
than
a
baltic
cove
even
less
beastly
civilization
about
we
seven
miles
from
the
nearest
coast
and
five
even
from
neuerk
look
they
lighting
up
there
was
a
tiny
spark
in
the
east
suppose
it
all
right
i
said
i
rather
see
a
solid
breakwater
somewhere
it
a
night
and
i
do
like
this
swell
swell
nothing
said
davies
only
a
stray
drain
from
outside
as
for
breakwaters
you
got
them
all
round
you
only
they
hidden
ahead
and
to
starboard
is
the
west
hohenh√∂rn
curling
round
to
the
for
all
the
world
like
a
stone
pier
you
can
hear
the
surf
battering
on
its
outside
over
to
the
north
where
i
was
nearly
wrecked
that
day
and
the
little
channel
i
stumbled
into
must
be
quite
near
us
somewhere
half
a
mile
away
to
port
there
is
the
east
hohenh√∂rn
where
i
brought
up
after
dashing
across
this
lake
we
in
another
mile
astern
is
the
main
body
of
the
sands
the
top
prong
of
your
fork
so
you
see
we
shut
in
practically
surely
you
remember
the
chart
why
it
confound
the
chart
i
broke
out
finding
this
flow
of
plausible
comfort
too
dismally
suggestive
for
my
nerves
at
it
man
supposing
anything
happens
supposing
it
blows
a
gale
but
it
no
good
shivering
here
and
staring
at
the
view
i
going
below
there
was
a
quart
below
during
which
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
forgot
the
quest
soup
do
you
feel
inclined
for
said
davies
timidly
after
a
black
silence
of
some
minutes
that
simple
remark
more
eloquent
of
security
than
a
thousand
technical
arguments
saved
the
situation
say
davies
i
said
a
cur
at
the
best
and
you
must
spare
me
but
you
not
like
any
yachtsman
i
ever
met
before
or
any
sailor
of
any
sort
you
so
casual
and
quiet
in
the
extraordinary
things
you
do
i
believe
i
should
like
you
better
if
you
let
fly
a
volley
of
oaths
sometimes
or
threatened
to
put
me
in
irons
davies
opened
wide
eyes
and
said
it
was
all
his
fault
for
forgetting
that
i
was
not
as
used
to
such
anchorages
as
he
was
by
the
way
he
added
to
its
blowing
a
gale
i
should
wonder
if
it
did
the
glass
is
falling
hard
but
it
ca
hurt
us
you
see
even
at
high
water
the
drift
of
the
sea
for
heaven
sake
do
begin
again
you
prove
soon
that
we
safer
here
than
in
an
hotel
let
have
dinner
and
a
thundering
good
one
dinner
ran
a
smooth
course
but
just
as
coffee
was
being
brewed
the
hull
from
pitching
regularly
began
to
roll
knew
she
would
said
davies
was
going
to
warn
you
only
the
ebb
has
set
in
the
wind
it
quite
safe
thought
you
said
it
would
get
calmer
when
the
tide
fell
it
will
but
it
may
rougher
tides
are
queer
things
he
added
as
though
in
defence
of
some
not
very
respectable
acquaintances
he
busied
himself
with
his
logbook
swaying
easily
to
the
motion
of
the
boat
and
i
for
my
part
tried
to
write
up
my
diary
but
i
could
not
fix
my
attention
every
loose
article
in
the
boat
became
audibly
restless
cans
clinked
cupboards
rattled
lockers
uttered
hollow
groans
small
things
sidled
out
of
dark
and
danced
grotesque
drunken
figures
on
the
floor
like
goblins
in
a
haunted
glade
the
mast
whined
dolorously
at
every
heel
and
the
centreboard
hiccoughed
and
choked
overhead
another
horde
of
demons
seemed
to
have
been
let
loose
the
deck
and
mast
were
conductors
which
magnified
every
sound
and
made
the
of
every
rope
end
resemble
the
blows
of
a
hammer
and
the
slapping
of
the
halyards
against
the
mast
the
rattle
of
a
maxim
gun
the
whole
tumult
beat
time
to
a
rhythmical
chorus
which
became
maddening
might
turn
in
now
said
davies
ten
sleep
through
this
i
exclaimed
ca
stand
this
i
must
something
ca
we
go
for
another
walk
i
spoke
in
bitter
jest
course
we
can
said
davies
you
do
mind
a
bit
of
a
tumble
in
the
dinghy
i
reconsidered
my
rash
suggestion
but
it
was
too
late
now
to
turn
back
and
some
desperate
expedient
was
necessary
i
found
myself
on
deck
gripping
a
backstay
and
looking
giddily
down
and
then
up
at
the
dinghy
as
it
bobbed
like
a
cork
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
alongside
while
davies
settled
the
sculls
and
rowlocks
he
shouted
and
before
i
could
gather
my
wits
and
clutch
the
sides
we
were
adrift
in
the
night
reeling
from
hollow
to
hollow
of
the
steep
curling
waves
davies
nursed
our
tenderly
over
their
crests
edging
her
slantwise
across
their
course
he
used
very
little
exertion
relying
on
the
tide
to
carry
us
to
our
goal
suddenly
the
motion
ceased
a
dark
slope
loomed
up
out
of
the
night
and
the
dinghy
rested
softly
in
a
shallow
eddy
west
hohenh√∂rn
said
davies
we
jumped
out
and
sank
into
soft
mud
hauled
up
the
dinghy
a
foot
or
two
then
mounted
the
bank
and
were
on
hard
wet
sand
the
wind
leapt
on
us
and
choked
our
voices
find
my
channel
bawled
davies
way
keep
neuerk
light
right
astern
of
you
we
set
off
with
a
long
stooping
stride
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
and
straight
towards
the
roar
of
the
breakers
on
the
farther
side
of
the
sand
a
line
of
matthew
arnold
naked
shingles
of
the
world
was
running
in
my
head
miles
from
land
i
thought
like
on
a
transient
islet
of
sand
encircled
by
rushing
tides
and
hammered
by
ocean
at
midnight
in
a
rising
gale
cut
off
even
from
our
one
dubious
refuge
it
was
the
time
if
ever
to
conquer
weakness
a
mad
gaiety
surged
through
me
as
i
drank
the
wind
and
pressed
forward
it
seemed
but
a
minute
or
two
and
davies
clutched
me
out
he
shouted
my
channel
the
ground
sloped
down
and
a
rushing
river
glimmered
before
us
we
struck
off
at
a
tangent
and
followed
its
course
to
the
north
stumbling
in
muddy
rifts
slipping
on
seaweed
beginning
to
be
blinded
by
a
fine
salt
spray
and
deafened
by
the
thunder
of
the
ocean
surf
the
river
broadened
whitened
roughened
gathered
itself
for
the
shock
was
shattered
and
dissolved
in
milky
gloom
we
wheeled
away
to
the
right
and
splashed
into
yeasty
froth
i
turned
my
back
to
the
wind
scooped
the
brine
out
of
my
eyes
faced
back
and
saw
that
our
path
was
barred
by
a
welter
of
surf
davies
voice
was
in
my
ear
and
his
arm
was
pointing
seaward
is
about
where
i
bumped
first
worse
then
wind
this
is
nothing
let
go
right
round
we
galloped
away
with
the
wind
behind
us
skirting
the
line
of
surf
i
lost
all
account
of
time
and
direction
another
sea
barred
our
road
became
another
river
as
we
slanted
along
its
shore
again
we
were
in
the
teeth
of
that
intoxicating
wind
then
a
point
of
light
was
swaying
and
flickering
away
to
the
left
and
now
we
were
checking
and
circling
i
stumbled
against
something
sharp
the
gunwale
so
we
had
completed
the
circuit
of
our
fugitive
domain
that
nightmare
island
as
i
always
remember
it
must
scull
too
said
davies
blowing
hard
now
keep
her
nose
a
little
all
you
know
we
lurched
along
my
scull
sometimes
buried
to
the
thwart
sometimes
striking
at
the
bubbles
of
a
wave
top
davies
in
the
bows
said
or
at
intervals
i
heard
the
scud
smacking
against
his
oilskin
back
then
a
wan
yellow
light
glanced
over
the
waves
let
her
come
and
the
bowsprit
of
the
swollen
to
spectral
proportions
was
stabbing
the
darkness
above
me
a
bit
two
good
strokes
ship
your
scull
now
jump
i
clawed
at
the
tossing
hull
and
landed
in
a
heap
davies
followed
with
the
painter
and
the
dinghy
swept
astern
riding
beautifully
now
said
he
when
he
had
secured
the
painter
be
no
rolling
on
the
flood
and
it
nearly
low
water
i
do
think
i
should
have
cared
however
much
she
had
rolled
i
was
finally
cured
of
funk
it
was
well
that
i
was
for
to
be
pitched
out
of
your
bunk
on
to
wet
is
a
disheartening
beginning
to
a
day
this
happened
about
eight
the
yacht
was
pitching
violently
and
i
crawled
on
all
fours
into
the
cabin
where
davies
was
setting
out
breakfast
on
the
floor
let
you
sleep
on
he
said
ca
do
anything
till
the
water
falls
we
should
never
get
the
anchor
up
in
this
sea
come
and
have
a
look
round
it
clearing
now
he
went
on
when
we
were
crouching
low
on
deck
gripping
cleats
for
safety
veered
to
it
been
blowing
a
full
gale
and
the
sea
is
at
its
worst
now
near
high
water
you
never
see
worse
than
this
i
was
prepared
for
what
i
saw
the
stormy
sea
for
leagues
around
and
a
chaos
of
breakers
where
our
had
stood
and
took
it
quietly
even
with
a
sort
of
elation
the
faced
the
storm
as
doggedly
as
ever
plunging
her
bowsprit
into
the
sea
and
flinging
green
water
over
her
bows
a
wave
of
confidence
and
affection
for
her
welled
through
me
i
had
been
used
to
resent
the
weight
and
bulk
of
her
unwieldy
anchor
and
cable
but
i
saw
their
use
now
varnish
paint
spotless
decks
and
snowy
sails
were
foppish
absurdities
of
a
hateful
past
can
we
do
i
asked
must
keep
well
inside
the
banks
and
be
precious
careful
wherever
there
a
swell
it
rampant
in
here
you
see
in
spite
of
the
barrier
of
sand
but
there
plenty
we
can
do
farther
back
we
breakfasted
in
horrible
discomfort
then
smoked
and
talked
till
the
roar
of
the
breakers
dwindled
at
the
first
sign
of
bare
sand
we
got
under
way
under
mizzen
and
headsails
only
and
i
learned
how
to
sail
a
reluctant
anchor
out
of
the
ground
pivoting
round
we
scudded
east
before
the
wind
over
the
ground
we
had
traversed
the
evening
before
while
an
archipelago
of
new
banks
slowly
shouldered
up
above
the
fast
weakening
waves
we
trod
delicately
among
and
around
them
sounding
and
observing
heaving
to
where
space
permitted
and
sometimes
using
the
dinghy
i
began
to
see
where
the
risks
lay
in
this
sort
of
navigation
wherever
the
ocean
swell
penetrated
or
the
wind
blew
straight
down
a
long
deep
channel
we
had
to
be
very
cautious
and
leave
good
margins
the
sort
of
place
you
must
ground
on
davies
used
to
say
in
the
end
we
traversed
the
steil
sand
again
but
by
a
different
swatchway
and
anchored
after
an
arduous
day
in
a
notch
on
its
eastern
limit
just
clear
of
the
swell
that
rolled
in
from
the
turbulent
estuary
of
the
elbe
the
night
was
fair
and
when
the
tide
receded
we
lay
perfectly
still
the
fresh
wind
only
sending
a
of
ripples
against
our
sides
xiii
the
meaning
of
our
work
nothing
happened
during
the
next
ten
days
to
disturb
us
at
our
work
during
every
hour
of
daylight
and
many
of
darkness
sailing
or
anchored
aground
or
afloat
in
rain
and
shine
wind
and
calm
we
studied
the
bed
of
the
estuaries
and
practised
ourselves
in
threading
the
network
of
channels
holding
no
communication
with
the
land
and
rarely
approaching
it
it
was
a
life
of
toil
exposure
and
peril
a
struggle
against
odds
too
for
wild
autumnal
weather
was
the
rule
with
the
wind
backing
and
veering
between
the
and
and
only
for
two
placid
days
blowing
gently
from
the
east
the
safe
quarter
for
this
region
its
force
and
direction
determined
each
fresh
choice
of
ground
if
it
was
high
and
northerly
we
explored
the
inner
fastnesses
in
moderate
intervals
the
exterior
fringe
darting
when
surprised
into
whatever
lair
was
most
convenient
sometimes
we
were
tramping
vast
solitudes
of
sand
sometimes
scudding
across
ephemeral
tracts
of
shallow
sea
again
we
were
creeping
gingerly
round
the
deeper
arteries
that
surround
the
great
knecht
examining
their
convolutions
as
it
were
the
veins
of
a
living
tissue
and
the
circulation
of
the
tide
throbbing
through
them
like
blood
again
we
would
be
staggering
through
the
and
overfalls
that
infest
the
open
fairway
of
the
weser
on
our
passage
between
the
fork
and
the
pike
on
one
of
our
fine
days
i
saw
the
scene
of
davies
original
adventure
by
daylight
with
the
banks
dry
and
the
channels
manifest
the
reader
has
seen
it
on
the
chart
and
can
up
to
a
point
form
his
opinion
i
can
only
add
that
i
realized
by
ocular
proof
that
no
more
fatal
trap
could
have
been
devised
for
an
innocent
stranger
for
approaching
it
from
the
under
the
easiest
conditions
it
was
hard
enough
to
verify
our
true
course
in
a
period
so
full
of
new
excitements
it
is
not
easy
for
me
to
say
when
we
were
hardest
put
to
it
especially
as
it
was
a
rule
with
davies
never
to
admit
that
we
were
in
any
danger
at
all
but
i
think
that
our
ugliest
experience
was
on
the
when
owing
to
some
minute
miscalculation
we
stranded
in
a
dangerous
spot
mere
stranding
of
course
was
all
in
the
day
work
the
constantly
recurring
question
being
when
and
where
to
court
or
risk
it
this
time
we
were
so
situated
that
when
the
rising
tide
came
again
we
were
on
a
lee
shore
broadside
on
to
a
gale
of
wind
which
was
sending
a
nasty
sea
with
a
drift
to
give
it
force
down
robin
balje
which
is
one
of
the
deeper
arteries
i
spoke
of
above
and
now
lay
dead
to
windward
of
us
the
climax
came
about
ten
at
night
can
do
nothing
till
she
floats
said
davies
and
i
can
see
him
now
quietly
smoking
and
splicing
a
chafed
warp
while
he
explained
that
her
double
skin
of
teak
fitted
her
to
stand
anything
in
reason
she
certainly
had
a
terrific
test
that
night
for
the
bottom
was
hard
unyielding
sand
on
which
she
rose
and
fell
with
convulsive
vehemence
the
last
was
for
me
one
of
almost
intolerable
tension
i
spent
it
on
deck
unable
to
bear
the
suspense
below
sheets
of
driven
sea
flew
bodily
over
the
hull
and
a
score
of
times
i
thought
she
must
succumb
as
she
shivered
to
the
blows
of
her
keel
on
the
sand
but
those
stout
skins
knit
by
honest
labour
stood
the
trial
one
final
thud
and
she
wrenched
herself
bodily
free
found
her
anchor
and
rode
clear
on
the
whole
i
think
we
made
few
mistakes
davies
had
a
supreme
aptitude
for
the
work
every
hour
sometimes
every
minute
brought
its
problem
and
his
resource
never
failed
the
stiffer
it
was
the
cooler
he
became
he
had
too
that
intuition
which
is
independent
of
acquired
skill
and
is
at
the
root
of
all
genius
which
to
take
cases
analogous
to
his
own
is
the
last
quality
of
the
perfect
guide
or
scout
i
believe
he
could
sand
where
he
could
not
see
or
touch
it
as
for
me
the
sea
has
never
been
my
element
and
never
will
be
nevertheless
i
hardened
to
the
life
grew
salt
tough
and
tolerably
alert
as
a
soldier
learns
more
in
a
week
of
war
than
in
years
of
parades
and
pipeclay
so
cut
off
from
all
distractions
moving
from
bivouac
to
precarious
bivouac
and
depending
to
some
extent
for
my
life
on
my
muscles
and
wits
i
rapidly
learnt
my
work
and
gained
a
certain
dexterity
i
knew
my
ropes
in
the
dark
could
beat
economically
to
windward
through
squalls
take
bearings
and
estimate
the
interaction
of
wind
and
tide
we
were
generally
in
solitude
but
occasionally
we
met
galliots
like
the
tacking
through
the
sands
and
once
or
twice
we
found
a
fleet
of
such
boats
anchored
in
a
gut
waiting
for
water
their
draught
loaded
was
from
six
to
seven
feet
our
own
only
four
without
our
but
we
took
their
mean
draught
as
the
standard
of
all
our
observations
that
is
we
set
ourselves
to
ascertain
when
and
how
a
vessel
drawing
six
and
a
half
feet
could
navigate
the
sands
a
word
more
as
to
our
motive
it
was
davies
conviction
as
i
have
said
that
the
whole
region
would
in
war
be
an
ideal
for
small
marauders
and
i
began
to
know
he
was
right
for
look
at
the
three
through
the
sands
to
hamburg
bremen
wilhelmshaven
and
the
heart
of
commercial
germany
they
are
like
highways
piercing
a
mountainous
district
by
defiles
where
a
handful
of
desperate
men
can
arrest
an
army
follow
the
parallel
of
a
war
on
land
people
your
mountains
with
a
daring
and
resourceful
race
who
possess
an
intimate
knowledge
of
every
track
and
who
operate
in
small
bands
travel
light
and
move
rapidly
see
what
an
immense
advantage
such
guerillas
possess
over
an
enemy
which
clings
to
beaten
tracks
moves
in
large
bodies
slowly
and
does
not
the
country
see
how
they
can
not
only
inflict
disasters
on
a
foe
who
vastly
overmatches
them
in
strength
but
can
prolong
a
resistance
long
after
all
decisive
battles
have
been
fought
see
too
how
the
strong
invader
can
only
conquer
his
elusive
antagonists
by
learning
their
methods
studying
the
country
and
matching
them
in
mobility
and
cunning
the
parallel
must
not
be
pressed
too
far
but
that
this
sort
of
warfare
will
have
its
counterpart
on
the
sea
is
a
truth
which
can
not
be
questioned
davies
in
his
enthusiasm
set
no
limits
to
its
importance
the
small
boat
in
shallow
waters
played
a
mighty
in
his
vision
of
a
naval
war
a
part
that
would
grow
in
importance
as
the
war
developed
and
reach
its
height
in
the
final
stages
heavy
battle
fleets
are
all
very
well
he
used
to
say
if
the
sides
are
well
matched
there
might
be
nothing
left
of
them
after
a
few
months
of
war
they
might
destroy
one
another
mutually
leaving
as
nominal
conqueror
an
admiral
with
scarcely
a
battleship
to
bless
himself
with
it
then
that
the
true
struggle
will
set
in
and
then
that
anything
that
will
float
will
be
pressed
into
the
service
and
anybody
who
can
steer
a
boat
knows
his
waters
and
does
care
the
toss
of
a
coin
for
his
life
will
have
magnificent
opportunities
it
cuts
both
ways
what
small
boats
can
do
in
these
waters
is
plain
enough
but
take
our
own
case
say
we
beaten
on
the
high
seas
by
a
coalition
there
then
a
risk
of
starvation
or
invasion
it
all
rot
what
they
talk
about
instant
surrender
we
can
live
on
half
rations
recuperate
and
build
but
we
must
have
time
meanwhile
our
coast
and
ports
are
in
danger
for
the
millions
we
sink
in
forts
and
mines
wo
carry
us
far
they
fixed
pure
passive
defence
what
you
want
is
mosquitoes
with
stings
swarms
of
them
intelligent
irregulars
manned
by
local
men
with
a
pretty
free
hand
to
play
their
own
game
and
what
a
splendid
game
to
play
there
are
places
very
like
this
over
there
nothing
half
so
good
but
similar
the
mersey
estuary
the
dee
the
severn
the
wash
and
best
of
all
the
thames
with
all
the
kent
essex
and
suffolk
banks
round
it
but
as
for
defending
our
coasts
in
the
way
i
mean
we
nothing
ready
nothing
whatsoever
we
do
even
build
or
use
small
these
fast
destroyers
are
no
good
for
work
too
long
and
unmanageable
and
most
of
them
too
deep
what
you
want
is
something
strong
and
simple
of
light
draught
and
with
only
a
if
it
came
to
that
tugs
launches
small
yachts
anything
would
do
at
a
pinch
for
success
would
depend
on
intelligence
not
on
brute
force
or
complicated
mechanism
they
get
wiped
out
often
but
what
matter
there
be
no
lack
of
the
right
sort
of
men
for
them
if
the
thing
was
but
where
are
the
men
suppose
we
have
the
best
of
it
on
the
high
seas
and
have
to
attack
or
blockade
a
coast
like
this
which
is
sand
from
end
to
end
you
ca
improvise
people
who
are
at
home
in
such
waters
the
navy
chaps
do
learn
it
though
by
jove
they
the
most
magnificent
service
in
the
world
in
pluck
and
nerve
and
everything
else
they
anything
and
often
do
the
impossible
but
their
boats
are
deep
and
they
get
little
practice
in
this
sort
of
thing
davies
never
pushed
home
his
argument
here
but
i
know
that
it
was
the
passionate
wish
of
his
heart
somehow
and
somewhere
to
get
a
chance
of
turning
his
knowledge
of
this
coast
to
practical
account
in
the
war
that
he
felt
was
bound
to
come
to
play
that
in
this
the
most
fascinating
field
for
it
i
can
do
no
more
than
sketch
his
views
hearing
them
as
i
did
with
the
very
splash
of
the
surf
and
the
bubble
of
the
tides
in
my
ears
they
made
a
profound
impression
on
me
and
gave
me
the
very
zeal
for
our
work
he
by
temperament
possessed
but
as
the
days
passed
and
nothing
occurred
to
disturb
us
i
felt
more
and
more
strongly
that
as
regards
our
quest
we
were
on
the
wrong
tack
we
found
nothing
suspicious
nothing
that
suggested
a
really
adequate
motive
for
dollmann
treachery
i
became
impatient
and
was
for
pushing
on
more
quickly
westward
davies
still
clung
to
his
theory
but
the
same
feeling
influenced
him
something
to
do
with
these
channels
in
the
sand
he
persisted
i
afraid
as
you
say
we
have
got
at
the
heart
of
the
mystery
nobody
seems
to
care
a
rap
what
we
do
we
have
done
the
estuaries
as
well
as
i
should
like
but
we
better
push
on
to
the
islands
it
exactly
the
same
sort
of
work
and
just
as
important
i
believe
we
bound
to
get
a
clue
soon
there
was
also
the
question
of
time
for
me
at
least
i
was
due
to
be
back
in
london
unless
i
obtained
an
extension
on
the
and
our
present
rate
of
progress
was
slow
but
i
can
not
conscientiously
say
that
i
made
a
serious
point
of
this
if
there
was
any
value
in
our
enterprise
at
all
official
duty
pales
beside
it
the
machinery
of
state
would
not
suffer
from
my
absence
excuses
would
have
to
be
made
and
the
results
braved
all
the
time
our
sturdy
little
craft
grew
shabbier
and
more
the
varnish
thinner
the
decks
greyer
the
sails
dingier
and
the
cabin
roof
more
murky
where
stained
it
but
the
only
beauty
she
ever
possessed
that
of
perfect
fitness
for
her
functions
remained
with
nothing
to
compare
her
to
she
became
a
home
to
me
my
joints
adapted
themselves
to
her
crabbed
limits
my
tastes
and
habits
to
her
plain
domestic
economy
but
oil
and
water
were
running
low
and
the
time
had
come
for
us
to
be
forced
to
land
and
renew
our
stock
xiv
the
first
night
in
the
islands
a
low
line
of
sandhills
pink
and
fawn
in
the
setting
sun
at
one
end
of
them
a
little
white
village
huddled
round
the
base
of
a
massive
lighthouse
such
was
wangeroog
the
easternmost
of
the
frisian
islands
as
i
saw
it
on
the
evening
of
october
we
had
decided
to
make
it
our
first
and
since
it
possesses
no
harbour
and
is
hedged
by
a
mile
of
sand
at
low
water
we
had
run
in
on
the
rising
tide
till
the
yacht
grounded
in
order
to
save
ourselves
as
much
labour
as
possible
in
the
carriage
to
and
fro
of
the
heavy
and
which
we
had
to
replenish
in
faint
outline
three
miles
to
the
south
of
us
was
the
flat
plain
of
friesland
broken
only
by
some
trees
a
windmill
or
two
and
a
church
spire
between
the
shallow
expanse
of
sea
was
already
beginning
to
shrink
away
into
lagoons
chief
among
which
was
the
narrow
passage
by
which
we
had
approached
from
the
east
this
continued
its
course
west
directly
parallel
to
the
island
and
in
it
at
a
distance
of
half
a
mile
from
us
three
galliots
lay
at
anchor
before
supper
was
over
the
yacht
was
high
and
dry
and
when
we
had
eaten
davies
loaded
himself
with
cans
and
breakers
i
was
for
taking
my
share
but
he
induced
me
to
stay
aboard
for
i
was
dead
tired
after
an
unusually
long
and
trying
day
which
had
begun
at
when
using
a
precious
instalment
of
east
wind
we
had
started
on
a
complete
passage
of
the
sands
from
the
elbe
to
the
jade
it
was
a
barely
possible
feat
for
a
boat
of
our
low
speed
to
perform
in
only
two
tides
and
though
we
just
succeeded
it
was
only
by
dint
of
tireless
vigilance
and
severe
physical
strain
out
the
anchor
when
you
had
a
smoke
said
davies
keep
an
eye
on
the
it
my
only
guide
back
he
lowered
himself
and
i
heard
the
scrunch
of
his
as
he
disappeared
in
the
darkness
it
was
a
fine
starry
night
with
a
touch
of
frost
in
the
air
i
lit
a
cigar
and
stretched
myself
on
a
sofa
close
to
the
glow
of
the
stove
the
cigar
soon
languished
and
dropped
and
i
dozed
uneasily
for
the
was
on
my
mind
i
got
up
once
and
squinted
at
it
through
the
skylight
saw
it
burning
steadily
and
lay
down
again
the
cabin
lamp
wanted
oil
and
was
dying
down
to
a
wick
but
i
was
too
drowsy
to
attend
to
it
and
it
went
out
i
lit
my
cigar
stump
again
and
tried
to
keep
awake
by
thinking
it
was
the
first
time
i
and
davies
had
been
separated
for
so
long
yet
so
used
had
we
grown
to
freedom
from
interference
that
this
would
not
have
disturbed
me
in
the
least
were
it
not
for
a
sudden
presentiment
that
on
this
first
night
of
the
second
stage
of
our
labours
something
would
happen
all
at
once
i
heard
a
sound
outside
a
splashing
footstep
as
of
a
man
stepping
in
a
puddle
i
was
wide
awake
in
an
instant
but
never
thought
of
shouting
that
you
davies
for
i
knew
in
a
flash
that
it
was
not
he
it
was
the
slip
of
a
stealthy
man
presently
i
heard
another
footstep
the
pad
of
a
boot
on
the
sand
this
time
close
to
my
ear
just
outside
the
hull
then
some
more
fainter
and
farther
aft
i
gently
rose
and
peered
aft
through
the
skylight
a
glimmer
of
light
reflected
from
below
was
wavering
over
the
and
bumpkin
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
which
hung
on
the
forestay
my
prowler
i
understood
had
struck
a
match
and
was
reading
the
name
on
the
stern
how
much
farther
would
his
curiosity
carry
him
the
match
went
out
and
footsteps
were
audible
again
then
a
strong
guttural
voice
called
in
german
ahoy
i
kept
silence
ahoy
a
little
louder
this
time
a
pause
and
then
a
vibration
of
the
hull
as
boots
scraped
on
it
and
hands
grasped
the
gunwale
my
visitor
was
on
deck
i
bobbed
down
sat
on
the
sofa
and
i
heard
him
moving
along
the
deck
quickly
and
confidently
first
forward
to
the
bows
where
he
stopped
then
back
to
the
companion
amidships
inside
the
cabin
it
was
pitch
dark
but
i
heard
his
boots
on
the
ladder
feeling
for
the
steps
in
another
moment
he
would
be
in
the
doorway
lighting
his
second
match
surely
it
was
darker
than
before
there
had
been
a
little
glow
from
the
reflected
on
to
the
skylight
but
it
had
disappeared
i
looked
up
realized
and
made
a
fool
of
myself
in
a
few
seconds
more
i
should
have
seen
my
visitor
face
to
face
perhaps
had
an
interview
but
i
was
new
to
this
sort
of
work
and
lost
my
head
all
i
thought
of
was
last
words
and
saw
him
astray
on
the
sands
with
no
light
to
guide
him
back
the
tide
rising
and
a
heavy
load
i
started
up
involuntarily
bumped
against
the
table
and
set
the
stove
jingling
a
long
step
and
a
grab
at
the
ladder
but
just
too
late
i
grasped
something
damp
and
greasy
there
was
tugging
and
hard
breathing
and
i
was
left
clasping
a
big
whose
owner
i
heard
jump
on
to
the
sand
and
run
i
scrambled
out
vaulted
overboard
and
followed
blindly
by
the
sound
he
had
doubled
round
the
bows
of
the
yacht
and
i
did
the
same
ducked
under
the
bowsprit
forgetting
the
bobstay
and
fell
violently
on
my
head
with
all
the
wind
knocked
out
of
me
by
a
wire
rope
and
block
whose
strength
and
bulk
was
one
of
the
glories
of
the
i
struggled
on
as
soon
as
i
got
some
breath
but
my
invisible
quarry
was
far
ahead
i
pulled
off
my
heavy
boots
carried
them
and
ran
in
my
stockings
promptly
cutting
my
foot
on
some
pursuit
was
hopeless
and
a
final
stumble
over
a
bit
of
driftwood
sent
me
sprawling
with
agony
in
my
toes
limping
back
i
decided
that
i
had
made
a
very
poor
beginning
as
an
active
adventurer
i
had
gained
nothing
and
lost
a
great
deal
of
breath
and
skin
and
did
not
even
know
for
certain
where
i
was
the
yacht
light
was
extinguished
and
even
with
wangeroog
lighthouse
to
guide
me
i
found
it
no
easy
matter
to
find
her
she
had
no
anchor
out
if
the
tide
rose
and
how
was
davies
to
find
her
after
much
feeble
circling
i
took
to
lying
flat
at
intervals
in
the
hopes
of
seeing
her
silhouetted
against
the
starry
sky
this
plan
succeeded
at
last
and
with
relief
and
humility
i
boarded
her
relit
the
and
carried
off
the
kedge
anchor
the
strange
boot
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
but
it
told
no
tales
when
i
examined
it
it
was
eleven
past
low
water
davies
was
cutting
it
fine
if
he
was
to
get
aboard
without
the
dinghy
help
but
eventually
he
reappeared
in
the
most
prosaic
way
exhausted
with
his
heavy
load
but
full
of
talk
about
his
visit
ashore
he
began
while
we
were
still
on
deck
here
we
ought
to
have
settled
more
about
what
we
to
say
when
we
asked
questions
i
chose
a
shop
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
sort
of
inn
where
they
were
drinking
pink
gin
all
very
friendly
as
usual
and
i
found
myself
under
a
fire
of
questions
i
said
we
were
on
our
way
back
to
england
there
was
the
usual
rot
about
the
smallness
of
the
boat
etc
it
struck
me
that
we
should
want
some
other
pretence
for
going
so
slow
and
stopping
to
explore
so
i
had
to
bring
in
the
ducks
though
goodness
knows
we
do
want
to
waste
time
over
the
subject
was
quite
a
success
they
said
it
was
too
early
jealous
i
suppose
but
then
two
fellows
spoke
up
and
asked
to
be
taken
on
to
help
said
they
would
bring
their
punt
without
local
help
we
should
do
no
good
all
true
enough
no
doubt
but
what
a
nuisance
they
be
i
got
out
of
it
just
as
well
you
did
i
interposed
shall
never
be
able
to
leave
the
boat
by
herself
i
believe
we
watched
and
i
related
my
experience
it
a
pity
you
did
see
who
it
was
confound
that
bobstay
his
tactful
way
of
reflecting
on
my
clumsiness
way
did
he
run
i
pointed
vaguely
into
the
west
towards
the
island
i
wonder
if
it
someone
off
one
of
those
galliots
there
are
three
anchored
in
the
channel
over
there
you
can
see
their
lights
you
did
hear
a
boat
pulling
off
i
explained
that
i
had
been
a
miserable
failure
as
a
detective
done
jolly
well
i
think
said
davies
you
had
shouted
when
you
first
heard
him
we
should
know
less
still
and
we
got
a
boot
which
may
come
in
useful
anchor
out
all
right
let
get
below
we
smoked
and
talked
till
the
new
flood
lapping
softly
round
the
raised
her
without
a
jar
of
course
i
argued
there
might
be
nothing
in
it
the
visitor
might
have
been
a
commonplace
thief
an
apparently
deserted
yacht
was
a
tempting
bait
davies
scouted
this
possibility
from
the
first
not
like
that
in
germany
he
said
holland
if
you
like
they
do
anything
and
i
do
like
that
turning
out
of
the
lantern
to
gain
time
if
we
were
away
nor
did
i
in
spite
of
my
blundering
in
details
i
welcomed
the
incident
as
the
first
concrete
proof
that
the
object
of
our
quest
was
no
mare
nest
the
next
point
was
what
was
the
visitor
object
if
to
search
what
would
he
have
found
charts
of
course
with
all
our
corrections
and
notes
and
the
log
they
give
us
away
was
davies
instant
conclusion
not
having
his
faith
in
the
channel
theory
i
was
lukewarm
about
his
precious
charts
all
we
doing
nothing
wrong
as
you
often
said
yourself
i
said
still
as
a
true
index
to
our
mode
of
life
they
were
the
only
things
on
board
that
could
possibly
compromise
us
or
suggest
that
we
were
anything
more
than
eccentric
young
englishmen
cruising
for
sport
witness
the
and
pleasure
we
had
two
sets
of
charts
german
and
english
the
former
we
decided
to
use
in
practice
and
to
hide
together
with
the
log
if
occasion
demanded
my
diary
i
resolved
should
never
leave
my
person
then
there
were
the
naval
books
davies
scanned
them
with
a
look
i
knew
well
are
too
many
of
them
he
said
in
the
tone
of
a
cook
fixing
the
fate
of
superfluous
kittens
throw
them
overboard
very
old
anyhow
and
i
know
them
by
heart
not
here
i
protested
for
he
was
laying
greedy
hands
on
the
shelf
be
found
at
low
water
in
fact
i
should
leave
them
as
they
are
you
had
them
when
you
were
here
before
and
dollmann
knows
you
had
them
if
you
return
without
them
it
will
look
queer
they
were
spared
the
english
charts
being
relatively
useless
though
more
suitable
to
our
as
english
yachtsmen
were
to
be
left
in
evidence
as
shining
proofs
of
our
innocence
it
was
all
delightfully
casual
i
could
not
help
thinking
a
yacht
does
not
abound
in
dry
and
we
were
helpless
against
a
drastic
search
if
there
secrets
on
this
coast
to
guard
and
we
were
suspected
as
spies
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
an
official
visit
and
warning
there
need
be
no
prowlers
scuttling
off
when
alarmed
unless
indeed
it
was
thought
wisest
to
let
well
alone
if
we
harmless
and
not
to
arouse
suspicions
where
there
were
none
here
we
lost
ourselves
in
conjecture
whose
agent
was
the
prowler
if
dollmann
did
dollmann
know
now
that
the
was
safe
and
back
in
the
region
he
had
expelled
her
from
if
so
was
he
likely
to
return
to
the
policy
of
violence
we
found
ourselves
both
glancing
at
the
strung
up
under
the
racks
and
then
we
both
laughed
and
looked
foolish
war
of
wits
and
not
of
i
opined
look
at
the
chart
illustration
map
b
of
east
friesland
the
reader
is
already
familiar
with
the
general
aspect
of
this
singular
region
and
i
need
only
remind
him
that
the
mainland
is
that
district
of
prussia
which
is
known
as
east
friesland
it
is
a
see
map
b
short
peninsula
bounded
on
the
west
by
the
ems
estuary
and
beyond
that
by
holland
and
on
the
east
by
the
jade
estuary
a
country
containing
great
tracts
of
marsh
and
heath
and
few
towns
of
any
size
on
the
north
side
none
seven
islands
lie
off
the
coast
all
except
borkum
which
is
round
are
attenuated
strips
slightly
rarely
more
than
a
mile
broad
and
tapering
at
the
ends
in
length
averaging
about
six
miles
from
norderney
and
juist
which
are
seven
and
nine
respectively
to
little
baltrum
which
is
only
two
and
a
half
of
the
shoal
spaces
which
lie
between
them
and
the
mainland
dry
at
and
the
remaining
third
becomes
a
system
of
lagoons
whose
distribution
is
controlled
by
the
natural
drift
of
the
north
sea
as
it
forces
its
way
through
the
intervals
between
the
islands
each
of
these
intervals
resembles
the
bar
of
a
river
and
is
obstructed
by
dangerous
banks
over
which
the
sea
pours
at
every
tide
scooping
out
a
deep
pool
this
fans
out
and
ramifies
to
east
and
west
as
the
current
frees
itself
encircles
the
islands
and
spreads
over
the
intervening
flats
but
the
farther
it
penetrates
the
less
coursing
force
it
has
and
as
a
result
no
island
is
girt
completely
by
a
channel
about
midway
at
the
back
of
each
of
them
is
a
only
covered
for
five
or
six
hours
out
of
the
twelve
a
boat
even
of
the
lightest
draught
navigating
behind
the
islands
must
choose
its
moment
for
passing
these
as
to
navigability
the
sea
sums
up
the
matter
in
these
dry
terms
channels
dividing
these
islands
from
each
other
and
the
shore
afford
to
the
small
craft
of
the
country
the
means
of
communication
between
the
ems
and
the
jade
to
which
description
of
vessels
only
they
are
available
the
islands
are
dismissed
with
a
brief
note
or
two
about
beacons
and
lights
the
more
i
looked
at
the
chart
the
more
puzzled
i
became
the
islands
were
evidently
mere
sandbanks
with
a
cluster
of
houses
and
a
church
on
each
the
only
hint
of
animation
in
their
desolate
being
the
occasional
word
suggesting
that
they
were
visited
in
the
summer
months
by
a
handful
of
townsfolk
for
the
norderney
of
course
was
conspicuous
in
this
respect
but
even
its
town
which
i
know
by
repute
as
a
gay
and
fashionable
would
be
dead
and
empty
for
some
months
in
the
year
and
could
have
no
commercial
importance
no
man
could
do
anything
on
the
mainland
coast
a
monotonous
line
of
dyke
punctuated
at
intervals
by
an
infinitesimal
village
glancing
idly
at
the
names
of
these
villages
i
noticed
that
they
most
of
them
ended
in
siel
a
repulsive
termination
that
seemed
appropriate
to
the
whole
region
there
were
carolinensiel
bensersiel
etc
siel
means
either
a
sewer
or
a
sluice
the
latter
probably
in
this
case
for
i
noticed
that
each
village
stood
at
the
outlet
of
a
little
stream
which
evidently
carried
off
the
drainage
of
the
lowlands
behind
a
sluice
or
lock
would
be
necessary
at
the
mouth
for
at
high
tide
the
land
is
below
the
level
of
the
sea
looking
next
at
the
sands
outside
i
noticed
that
across
them
and
towards
each
outlet
a
line
of
booms
was
marked
showing
that
there
was
some
sort
of
tidal
approach
to
the
village
evidently
formed
by
the
scour
of
the
little
stream
we
going
to
explore
those
i
asked
davies
do
see
the
use
he
answered
only
lead
to
those
potty
little
places
i
suppose
local
galliots
use
them
about
your
and
at
certain
tides
but
i
ca
see
what
value
be
unless
as
a
refuge
for
a
german
boat
in
the
last
resort
they
lead
to
no
harbours
wait
there
a
little
notch
in
the
dyke
at
neuharlingersiel
and
dornumersiel
which
may
mean
some
sort
of
a
quay
arrangement
but
what
the
use
of
that
may
as
well
visit
one
or
two
i
suppose
suppose
so
but
we
do
want
to
be
playing
round
villages
there
heaps
of
really
important
work
to
do
farther
out
what
you
make
of
this
coast
davies
had
nothing
but
the
same
old
theory
but
he
urged
it
with
a
force
and
keenness
that
impressed
me
more
deeply
than
ever
at
those
islands
he
said
clearly
the
old
line
of
coast
hammered
into
breaches
by
the
sea
the
space
behind
them
is
like
an
immense
tidal
harbour
thirty
miles
by
five
and
they
screen
it
impenetrably
it
absolutely
for
shallow
under
skilled
pilotage
they
can
nip
in
and
out
of
the
gaps
and
dodge
about
from
end
to
end
on
one
side
is
the
ems
on
the
other
the
big
estuaries
it
a
perfect
base
for
i
agreed
and
agree
still
but
still
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
go
on
exploring
then
in
the
same
way
keeping
a
sharp
though
remember
we
shall
always
be
in
sight
of
land
now
the
glass
doing
than
for
a
long
time
i
hope
it
wo
bring
fog
i
know
this
district
is
famous
for
fogs
and
fine
weather
at
this
time
of
the
year
is
bad
for
them
anywhere
i
would
rather
it
blew
if
it
for
exploring
those
gaps
where
an
wind
would
be
nasty
not
later
i
think
i
sleep
in
the
saloon
for
the
future
after
what
happened

b
the
decisive
incidents
of
our
cruise
were
now
fast
approaching
looking
back
on
the
steps
that
led
to
them
and
anxious
that
the
reader
should
be
wholly
with
us
in
our
point
of
view
i
think
i
can
not
do
better
than
give
extracts
from
my
diary
of
the
next
three
days
up
at
yacht
high
and
dry
of
the
three
galliots
out
at
anchor
in
the
channel
yesterday
only
one
is
left
i
took
my
turn
with
the
breakers
this
morning
and
walked
to
wangeroog
whose
village
i
found
half
lost
in
sand
drifts
which
are
planted
with
tufts
of
in
mathematical
rows
to
give
stability
and
prevent
a
catastrophe
like
that
at
pompeii
a
friendly
grocer
told
me
all
there
is
to
know
which
is
little
the
islands
are
what
we
thought
them
barren
for
the
most
part
with
a
small
fishing
population
and
a
scanty
accession
of
summer
visitors
for
bathing
the
season
is
over
now
and
business
slack
for
him
there
is
still
however
a
little
trade
with
the
mainland
in
galliots
and
lighters
a
few
of
which
come
from
the
siels
on
the
mainland
had
these
harbours
i
asked
he
replied
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
he
is
a
settler
in
these
wilds
not
a
native
said
he
had
heard
of
schemes
for
improving
them
so
as
to
develop
the
islands
as
but
thought
it
was
only
a
wild
speculation
heavy
tramp
back
to
the
yacht
nearly
crushed
by
impedimenta
while
davies
made
yet
another
trip
i
stalked
some
birds
with
a
gun
and
obtained
what
resembled
a
specimen
of
the
smallest
variety
of
and
small
at
that
but
i
made
a
great
noise
which
i
hope
persuaded
somebody
of
the
purity
of
our
motives
weighed
anchor
at
one
and
in
passing
the
anchored
galliot
took
a
good
look
at
her
was
on
her
stern
otherwise
she
was
just
like
a
hundred
others
nobody
was
on
deck
spent
the
whole
afternoon
till
dark
exploring
the
harle
or
gap
between
wangeroog
and
spiekeroog
the
sea
breaking
heavily
on
the
banks
outside
fine
as
the
day
was
the
scene
from
the
offing
was
desolate
to
the
last
degree
the
naked
spots
of
the
two
islands
are
hideous
in
their
sterility
melancholy
bits
of
their
only
relief
save
for
one
or
two
grotesque
beacons
and
most
of
all
a
great
standing
actually
the
water
on
the
north
side
of
wangeroog
a
striking
witness
to
the
encroachment
of
the
sea
on
the
mainland
which
was
barely
visible
there
was
one
very
prominent
landmark
a
spire
which
from
the
chart
we
took
to
be
that
of
a
town
four
miles
inland
days
are
growing
short
sunset
is
soon
after
five
and
an
hour
later
it
is
too
dark
to
see
booms
and
buoys
distinctly
the
tides
also
are
awkward
just
now
i
exclude
all
the
technicalities
that
i
can
but
the
reader
should
take
note
that
the
is
very
important
henceforward
at
morning
and
evening
is
between
five
and
six
just
at
twilight
for
the
night
we
groped
with
the
lead
into
the
muschel
balge
the
tributary
channel
which
laps
round
the
inside
of
spiekeroog
and
lay
in
two
fathoms
clear
of
the
outer
swell
but
rolling
a
little
when
the
ebb
set
in
strong
against
the
wind
galliot
passed
us
going
west
just
as
we
were
stowing
sails
too
dark
to
see
her
name
later
we
saw
her
higher
up
our
channel
great
event
of
the
day
has
been
the
sighting
of
a
small
german
gunboat
steaming
slowly
west
along
the
coast
that
was
about
four
when
we
were
sounding
along
the
harle
identified
her
at
once
as
the
commander
von
gunboat
we
wondered
if
he
recognized
the
but
anyway
she
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
us
and
steamed
slowly
on
we
quite
expected
to
fall
in
with
her
when
we
came
to
the
islands
but
the
actual
sight
of
her
has
excited
us
a
good
deal
she
is
an
ugly
cranky
little
vessel
painted
grey
with
one
funnel
davis
is
contemptuous
about
her
low
freeboard
forward
says
he
would
rather
go
to
sea
in
the
he
has
her
dimensions
and
armament
learnt
from
brassey
at
his
fingers
ends
one
hundred
and
forty
feet
by
one
gun
one
and
four
maxims
an
old
type
just
going
to
bed
a
bitterly
cold
night
glass
falling
heavily
this
morning
to
our
great
disgust
wind
back
in
the
sw
and
much
warmer
starting
at
we
tacked
on
the
tide
over
the
watershed
behind
spiekeroog
so
did
the
galliot
we
had
seen
last
night
but
we
again
missed
identifying
her
as
she
weighed
anchor
before
we
came
up
to
her
berth
davies
however
swore
she
was
the
we
lost
sight
of
her
altogether
for
the
greater
part
of
the
day
which
we
spent
in
exploring
the
otzumer
ee
the
gap
between
langeoog
and
spiekeroog
now
and
then
firing
some
perfunctory
shots
at
seals
and
nautical
details
omitted
in
the
evening
we
were
hurrying
back
to
an
inside
anchorage
when
we
made
a
bad
mistake
did
in
fact
what
we
had
never
done
before
ran
aground
on
the
very
top
of
high
water
and
are
now
sitting
hard
and
fast
on
the
edge
of
the
rute
flat
south
of
the
east
spit
of
langeoog
the
light
was
bad
and
a
misplaced
boom
tricked
us
failed
and
at
we
were
left
on
a
perfect
ararat
of
sand
and
only
a
yard
or
two
from
that
accursed
boom
which
is
perched
on
the
very
summit
as
a
lure
to
the
unwary
it
is
going
to
blow
hard
too
though
that
is
no
great
matter
as
we
are
sheltered
by
banks
on
the
and
sides
the
likely
quarters
we
hope
to
float
at
morning
but
to
make
sure
of
being
able
to
get
her
off
we
have
been
transferring
some
ballast
to
the
dinghy
by
way
of
lightening
the
yacht
a
horrid
business
handling
the
pigs
of
lead
heavy
greasy
and
black
the
saloon
is
an
inferno
the
deck
like
a
collier
and
ourselves
like
sweeps
anchors
are
laid
out
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
half
a
gale
from
the
when
we
turned
out
but
it
helped
us
to
float
off
safely
at
six
the
dinghy
was
very
nearly
swamped
with
the
weight
of
lead
in
it
and
getting
the
ballast
back
into
the
yacht
was
the
toughest
job
of
all
we
got
the
dinghy
alongside
and
davies
jumped
in
nearly
sinking
it
for
good
balanced
himself
fended
off
and
whenever
he
got
a
chance
attached
the
pigs
one
by
one
on
to
a
bight
of
rope
secured
to
the
peak
halyards
on
which
i
hoisted
from
the
deck
it
was
touch
and
go
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
easier
was
nine
before
we
had
finished
replacing
the
pigs
in
the
hold
a
filthy
but
delicate
operation
as
they
fit
like
a
puzzle
and
if
one
is
out
of
place
the
wo
shut
down
coming
on
deck
after
it
we
saw
to
our
surprise
the
lying
at
anchor
in
the
schill
balje
inside
spiekeroog
about
a
mile
and
a
half
off
she
must
have
entered
the
otzumer
ee
at
for
shelter
from
the
gale
a
neat
bit
of
work
for
a
vessel
of
her
size
as
davies
says
she
draws
and
there
ca
be
more
than
twelve
on
the
bar
at
neaps
several
smacks
had
run
in
too
and
there
were
two
galliots
farther
up
our
channel
but
we
could
make
out
if
the
was
one
the
banks
uncovered
we
lay
more
quietly
so
landed
and
took
a
long
tempestuous
walk
over
the
rute
with
compass
and
notebooks
returning
at
two
we
found
the
glass
tumbling
down
almost
visibly
suggested
running
for
bensersiel
one
of
the
mainland
villages
of
us
on
the
evening
flood
as
it
seemed
just
the
right
opportunity
if
we
were
to
visit
one
of
those
siels
at
all
davies
was
very
lukewarm
but
events
overcame
him
at
a
black
ragged
cloud
appearing
to
trail
into
the
very
sea
brought
up
a
terrific
squall
this
passed
and
there
was
a
deathly
pause
of
ten
minutes
while
the
whole
sky
eddied
as
with
then
an
icy
puff
struck
us
from
the
rapidly
veering
till
it
reached
there
it
settled
and
grew
harder
every
moment
to
only
the
worst
sort
do
that
said
davies
shift
to
the
east
changed
the
whole
situation
as
shifts
often
have
before
making
the
rute
flats
a
lee
shore
while
to
windward
lay
the
deep
lagoons
of
the
otzumer
ee
bounded
indeed
by
spiekeroog
but
still
offering
a
big
drift
for
wind
and
sea
we
had
to
clear
out
sharp
to
set
the
mizzen
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
beat
to
windward
for
it
was
blowing
a
hurricane
in
a
few
minutes
we
must
go
to
leeward
and
davies
was
for
running
farther
in
well
behind
the
jans
sand
and
not
risking
bensersiel
a
blunder
of
mine
when
i
went
to
the
winch
to
get
up
anchor
settled
the
question
thirty
out
of
our
forty
fathoms
of
chain
were
out
confused
by
the
motion
and
a
blinding
that
had
come
on
and
forgetting
the
tremendous
strain
on
the
cable
i
cast
the
slack
off
the
bitts
and
left
it
loose
there
was
then
only
one
turn
of
the
chain
round
the
drum
enough
in
ordinary
weather
to
prevent
it
running
out
but
now
my
first
heave
on
the
started
it
slipping
and
in
an
instant
it
was
whizzing
out
of
the
and
overboard
i
tried
to
stop
it
with
my
foot
stumbled
at
a
heavy
plunge
of
the
yacht
heard
something
snap
below
and
saw
the
last
of
it
disappear
the
yacht
fell
off
the
wind
and
drifted
astern
i
shouted
and
had
the
sense
to
hoist
the
reefed
foresail
at
once
davies
had
her
in
hand
in
no
time
and
was
steering
going
aft
i
found
him
cool
and
characteristic
does
matter
he
said
anchor
buoyed
ever
since
leaving
the
elbe
we
had
had
a
on
our
anchor
against
the
emergency
of
having
to
slip
our
cable
and
run
for
the
same
reason
the
end
of
the
chain
was
not
made
permanently
fast
below
we
come
back
and
get
it
ca
now
should
have
had
to
slip
it
anyhow
wind
and
sea
too
strong
we
try
for
bensersiel
ca
trust
to
a
warp
and
kedge
out
here
exciting
run
it
was
across
country
so
to
speak
over
an
unboomed
watershed
but
we
had
bearings
from
our
morning
walk
shoal
water
all
the
way
and
a
hollow
sea
breaking
everywhere
we
soon
made
out
the
bensersiel
booms
but
even
under
mizzen
and
foresail
only
we
travelled
too
fast
and
had
to
heave
to
outside
them
for
the
channel
looked
too
shallow
still
we
lowered
half
the
centreboard
and
kept
her
just
holding
her
own
to
windward
through
a
most
trying
period
in
the
end
had
to
run
for
it
sooner
than
we
meant
as
we
were
sagging
to
leeward
in
spite
of
all
and
the
light
was
failing
bore
up
at
and
raced
up
the
channel
with
the
booms
on
our
left
scarcely
visible
in
the
surf
and
rising
water
davies
stood
forward
signalling
port
starboard
or
steady
with
his
arms
while
i
wrestled
with
the
helm
flung
from
side
to
side
and
flogged
by
suddenly
found
a
sort
of
dyke
on
our
right
just
covering
with
sea
the
shore
appeared
through
scud
and
men
on
a
quay
shouting
davies
brandished
his
left
arm
furiously
i
ported
hard
and
we
were
in
smoother
water
a
few
seconds
more
and
we
were
whizzing
through
a
slit
between
two
wood
jetties
inside
a
small
square
harbour
showed
but
there
was
no
room
to
round
up
properly
and
no
time
to
lower
sails
davies
just
threw
the
kedge
over
and
it
just
got
a
grip
in
time
to
check
our
momentum
and
save
our
bowsprit
from
the
quayside
a
man
threw
us
a
rope
and
we
brought
up
alongside
rather
bewildered
more
so
than
the
natives
who
seemed
to
think
we
had
dropped
from
the
sky
they
were
very
friendly
with
an
undercurrent
of
disappointment
having
expected
salvage
work
outside
i
think

was
in

mess

wringing

producing

meanwhile
the

the

to

were
in

evidence
crying
for
notice
which
they
did
not
get
we
had
forgotten
our
precautions
in
the
hurry
of
our
start
from
the
rute
when
the
huge
form
was
as
full
as
he
could
make
it
he
suddenly
became
human
talkative
and
thirsty
and
when
we
treated
him
patronizing
it
seemed
to
dawn
on
him
that
under
our
rough
clothes
and
crust
of
brine
and
grime
we
were
two
mad
and
wealthy
aristocrats
worthy
of
a
high
official
he
insisted
on
our
bringing
our
cushions
to
dry
at
his
house
and
to
get
rid
of
him
we
consented
for
we
were
wet
hungry
and
longing
to
change
and
wash
he
talked
himself
away
at
last
and
we
hid
the
log
and
charts
but
he
returned
in
the
postmaster
uniform
this
time
before
we
had
finished
supper
and
haled
us
and
our
cushions
up
through
dark
and
mud
to
his
cottage
near
the
quay
to
reach
it
we
crossed
a
small
bridge
spanning
what
seemed
to
be
a
small
river
with
just
as
we
had
thought
showed
his
prizes
to
his
wife
who
was
quite
flustered
by
the
distinguished
strangers
and
received
the
cushions
with
awe
and
next
we
were
carried
off
to
the
gasthaus
and
exhibited
to
the
village
circle
where
we
talked
ducks
and
weather
nobody
takes
us
seriously
i
never
felt
less
like
a
conspirator
our
friend
who
is
a
chatterbox
is
enormously
important
about
his
ridiculous
little
port
whose
principal
customer
seems
to
be
the
langeoog
a
galliot
running
to
and
fro
according
to
tide
a
few
lighters
also
come
down
the
stream
with
bricks
and
produce
from
the
interior
and
are
towed
to
the
islands
the
harbour
has
from
five
to
seven
feet
in
it
for
two
hours
out
of
twelve
herr
schenkel
talked
us
back
to
the
yacht
which
we
found
resting
on
the
mud
and
here
we
are
davies
pretends
there
are
harbour
smells
and
says
he
wo
be
able
to
sleep
is
already
worrying
about
how
to
get
away
from
here
ashore
they
were
saying
that
it
impossible
under
sail
in
strong
winds
the
channel
being
too
narrow
to
tack
in
for
my
part
i
find
it
a
huge
relief
to
be
in
any
sort
of
harbour
after
a
fortnight
in
the
open
there
are
no
tides
or
anchors
to
think
about
and
no
bumping
or
rolling

xvi
commander
von
br√ºning
to
resume
my
story
in
narrative
form
i
was
awakened
at
ten
on
the
after
a
long
and
delicious
sleep
by
davies
voice
outside
talking
his
unmistakable
german
looking
out
in
my
pyjamas
i
saw
him
on
the
quay
above
in
conversation
with
a
man
in
a
long
mackintosh
coat
and
a
navy
cap
he
had
a
auburn
beard
a
keen
handsome
face
and
an
animated
manner
it
was
raining
in
a
raw
air
they
saw
me
and
davies
said
carruthers
here
commander
von
br√ºning
from
the
that
meiner
freund
carruthers
davies
was
deplorably
weak
in
terminations
the
commander
smiled
broadly
at
me
and
i
inclined
an
uncombed
head
while
for
a
moment
the
quest
was
a
dream
and
i
myself
felt
unutterably
squalid
and
foolish
i
ducked
down
heard
them
parting
and
davies
came
aboard
to
meet
him
at
the
inn
for
a
talk
at
twelve
he
said
his
news
was
that
the
had
come
in
on
the
morning
tide
and
he
had
met
von
br√ºning
when
marketing
at
the
inn
secondly
the
had
also
come
in
and
was
moored
close
by
it
was
as
clear
as
possible
therefore
that
the
latter
had
watched
us
and
was
in
touch
with
the
and
that
both
had
seized
the
opportunity
of
our
being
cooped
up
in
bensersiel
to
take
further
stock
of
us
what
had
passed
hitherto
nothing
much
von
br√ºning
had
greeted
davies
with
cordial
surprise
and
said
he
had
wondered
yesterday
if
it
was
the
that
he
had
seen
anchored
behind
langeoog
davies
had
explained
that
we
had
left
the
baltic
and
were
on
our
way
home
taking
the
shelter
of
the
islands
he
comes
on
board
and
asks
to
see
our
log
i
said
it
out
said
davies
rot
this
hiding
after
all
i
say
i
rather
funk
this
interview
what
are
we
to
say
it
not
in
my
line
we
resolved
abruptly
on
an
important
change
of
plan
replaced
the
log
and
charts
in
the
rack
as
the
first
logical
step
they
contained
nothing
but
bearings
courses
and
the
bare
data
of
navigation
to
davies
they
were
secrets
of
vital
import
to
be
lied
for
however
hard
and
distasteful
lying
was
i
was
cooler
as
to
their
value
but
in
any
case
the
same
thing
was
now
in
both
our
minds
there
would
be
great
difficulties
in
the
coming
interview
if
we
tried
to
be
too
clever
and
conceal
the
fact
that
we
had
been
exploring
we
did
not
know
how
much
von
br√ºning
knew
when
had
our
surveillance
by
the
begun
apparently
at
wangeroog
but
possibly
in
the
estuaries
where
we
had
not
fired
a
shot
at
duck
perhaps
he
knew
even
more
dollmann
treachery
davies
escape
and
our
subsequent
movements
we
could
not
tell
on
the
other
hand
exploration
was
known
to
be
a
fad
of
davies
and
in
september
he
had
made
no
secret
of
it
it
was
safer
to
be
consistent
now
after
breakfast
we
determined
to
find
out
something
about
the
which
lay
on
the
mud
at
the
other
side
of
the
harbour
and
accordingly
addressed
ourselves
to
two
mighty
sailors
whose
jerseys
bore
the
legend
and
who
towered
conspicuous
among
a
row
of
stolid
frisians
on
the
quay
all
gazing
gravely
down
at
us
as
at
a
curious
bit
of
marine
the
twins
for
such
they
proved
to
be
were
most
benignant
giants
and
asked
us
aboard
the
galliot
for
a
chat
it
was
easy
to
bring
the
talk
naturally
round
to
the
point
we
wished
and
we
soon
gained
some
most
interesting
information
delivered
in
the
broadest
frisian
but
intelligible
enough
they
called
the
a
memmert
boat
or
boat
it
seemed
that
off
the
western
end
of
the
island
lying
west
of
norderney
there
lay
the
bones
of
a
french
wrecked
ages
ago
she
carried
bullion
which
has
never
been
recovered
in
spite
of
many
efforts
a
salvage
company
was
trying
for
it
now
and
had
works
on
memmert
an
adjacent
sandbank
is
herr
grimm
the
overseer
himself
they
said
pointing
to
the
bridge
above
the
i
call
him
because
it
describes
him
exactly
a
man
in
a
pilot
jacket
and
peaked
cap
was
leaning
over
the
parapet
he
doing
here
i
asked
they
answered
that
he
was
often
up
and
down
the
coast
work
on
the
wreck
being
impossible
in
rough
weather
they
supposed
he
was
bringing
cargo
in
his
galliot
from
wilhelmshaven
all
the
plant
and
stores
coming
from
that
port
he
was
a
local
man
from
aurich
an
skipper
we
discussed
this
information
while
walking
out
over
the
sands
to
see
the
channel
at
low
water
you
hear
anything
about
this
in
september
i
asked
a
word
i
did
go
to
juist
i
would
have
probably
if
i
had
met
dollmann
what
in
the
world
did
it
mean
how
did
it
affect
our
plans
at
his
boots
if
we
pass
him
was
all
davies
had
to
suggest
the
channel
was
now
a
ditch
with
a
trickle
in
it
running
north
by
east
roughly
and
edged
by
a
dyke
of
withies
for
the
first
quarter
of
a
mile
it
was
still
blowing
fresh
from
the
and
we
saw
that
exit
was
impossible
in
such
a
wind
so
back
to
the
village
a
paltry
bleak
little
place
we
passed
friend
grimm
on
the
bridge
a
dark
saturnine
man
wearing
approaching
the
inn
have
settled
quite
enough
have
we
said
davies
about
our
future
plans
knows
we
have
i
said
i
do
see
how
we
can
we
must
see
how
things
go
it
past
twelve
and
it
wo
do
to
be
late
i
leave
it
to
you
right
i
do
my
best
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
be
yourself
and
tell
one
lie
if
need
be
about
the
trick
dollmann
played
you
the
next
scene
von
br√ºning
davies
and
i
sitting
over
coffee
and
k√ºmmel
at
a
table
in
a
dingy
overlooking
the
harbour
and
the
sea
davies
with
a
full
box
of
matches
on
the
table
before
him
the
commander
gave
us
a
hearty
welcome
and
i
am
bound
to
say
i
liked
him
at
once
as
davies
had
done
but
i
feared
him
too
for
he
had
honest
eyes
but
abominably
clever
ones
i
had
impressed
on
davies
to
talk
and
question
as
freely
and
naturally
as
though
nothing
uncommon
had
happened
since
he
last
saw
von
br√ºning
on
the
deck
of
the
he
must
ask
about
dollmann
the
mutual
friend
at
the
outset
and
if
questioned
about
that
voyage
in
his
company
to
the
elbe
must
lie
like
a
trooper
as
to
the
danger
he
had
been
in
this
was
the
one
clear
and
essential
necessity
where
much
was
difficult
davies
did
his
duty
with
precipitation
and
blushed
when
he
put
his
question
in
a
way
that
horrified
me
till
i
remembered
that
his
embarrassment
was
due
and
would
be
ascribed
to
another
cause
dollmann
is
away
still
i
think
said
von
br√ºning
so
davies
had
been
right
at
brunsb√ºttel
you
thinking
of
looking
him
up
again
he
added
said
davies
shortly
i
sure
he
away
but
his
yacht
is
back
i
believe
and
fr√§ulein
dollmann
i
suppose
said
davies
a
very
fine
boat
that
our
host
smiled
gazing
thoughtfully
at
davies
who
was
miserable
i
saw
a
chance
and
took
it
mercilessly
can
call
on
fr√§ulein
dollmann
at
least
davies
i
said
with
a
meaning
smile
at
von
br√ºning
said
davies
he
be
back
soon
do
you
think
the
commander
had
begun
to
light
a
cigar
and
took
his
time
in
answering
he
said
after
some
puffing
never
away
very
long
but
you
seen
them
later
than
i
have
did
you
sail
to
the
elbe
together
the
day
after
i
saw
you
last
part
of
the
way
said
davies
with
great
negligence
seen
him
since
he
got
there
first
outsailed
me
you
the
slip
in
fact
course
he
beat
me
i
was
besides
i
remember
there
was
a
heavy
blow
a
devil
of
a
heavy
blow
i
thought
of
you
that
day
how
did
you
manage
it
was
a
fair
wind
it
was
far
you
see
gott
in
he
nodded
towards
the
window
whence
the
taper
mast
could
be
seen
pointing
demurely
heavenwards
a
splendid
said
davies
indignantly
thousand
pardons
said
von
br√ºning
laughing
shake
my
faith
in
her
i
put
in
got
to
get
to
england
in
her
forbid
i
was
only
thinking
that
there
must
have
been
some
sea
round
the
scharhorn
that
day
a
tame
affair
no
doubt
herr
davies
said
davies
who
did
not
catch
the
idiom
in
the
latter
sentence
we
did
go
that
way
we
cut
through
the
sands
by
the
telte
telte
in
a
gale
the
commander
started
ceased
to
smile
and
only
stared
it
was
genuine
surprise
i
could
swear
it
he
had
heard
nothing
of
this
before
dollmann
knew
the
way
said
davies
doggedly
kindly
offered
to
pilot
me
through
and
i
would
have
gone
otherwise
there
was
an
awkward
little
pause
led
you
well
it
seems
said
von
br√ºning
there
a
nasty
surf
there
though
is
there
but
it
saves
six
miles
and
the
scharhorn
not
that
i
saved
distance
i
was
fool
enough
to
run
aground
said
the
other
with
interest
did
matter
because
i
was
well
inside
then
those
sands
are
difficult
at
high
water
we
come
back
that
way
you
know
we
run
aground
every
day
i
remarked
with
resignation
that
where
the
gave
you
the
slip
asked
von
br√ºning
still
studying
davies
with
a
strange
look
which
i
strove
anxiously
to
analyze
would
have
noticed
said
davies
was
very
thick
and
squally
and
she
had
got
some
way
ahead
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
stop
anyway
i
got
off
all
right
the
tide
was
rising
still
but
of
course
i
anchored
there
for
the
night
there
under
the
hohenh√∂rn
said
davies
simply
the
hohenh√∂rn
on
did
they
wait
for
you
at
cuxhaven
do
know
i
did
go
that
way
the
commander
looked
more
and
more
puzzled
by
the
ship
canal
i
mean
i
changed
my
mind
about
it
because
the
next
day
the
wind
was
easterly
it
would
have
been
a
dead
beat
across
the
sands
to
cuxhaven
while
it
was
a
fair
wind
straight
out
to
the
eider
river
so
i
sailed
there
and
reached
the
baltic
that
way
it
was
all
the
same
there
was
another
pause
done
davies
i
thought
he
had
told
his
story
well
using
no
subtlety
i
knew
it
was
exactly
how
he
would
have
told
it
to
anyone
else
if
he
had
not
had
irrefutable
proof
of
foul
play
the
commander
laughed
suddenly
and
heartily
liqueur
he
said
then
to
me
my
word
your
friend
amuses
me
it
impossible
to
make
him
spin
a
yarn
i
expect
he
had
a
bad
time
of
it
nothing
to
him
i
said
prefers
it
he
anchored
me
the
other
day
behind
the
hohenh√∂rn
in
a
gale
of
wind
said
it
was
safer
than
a
harbour
and
more
sanitary
wonder
he
brought
you
here
last
night
it
was
a
fair
wind
for
england
and
not
very
far
was
no
pilot
to
follow
you
see
a
charming
daughter
no
davies
frowned
and
glared
at
me
i
was
merciful
and
changed
the
subject
i
said
left
our
anchor
and
chain
out
there
and
i
made
confession
of
my
sin
as
it
buoyed
i
should
advise
you
to
pick
it
up
as
soon
as
you
can
said
von
br√ºning
carelessly
someone
else
will
by
jove
carruthers
said
davies
eagerly
must
get
out
on
this
next
tide
there
no
hurry
i
said
partly
from
policy
partly
because
the
ease
of
the
shore
was
on
me
to
sit
on
a
chair
upright
is
something
of
a
luxury
however
good
the
cause
in
which
you
have
crouched
like
a
monkey
over
a
table
at
the
level
of
your
knees
with
a
reeking
at
your
ear
honest
enough
about
here
are
they
i
added
while
the
words
were
on
my
lips
i
remembered
the
midnight
visitor
at
wangeroog
and
guessed
that
von
br√ºning
was
leading
up
to
a
test
grimm
if
he
was
the
visitor
would
have
told
him
of
his
narrow
escape
from
detection
and
reticence
on
our
part
would
show
we
suspected
something
i
could
have
kicked
myself
but
it
was
not
too
late
i
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
before
the
commander
could
answer
added
jove
davies
i
forgot
about
that
fellow
at
wangeroog
the
anchor
might
be
stolen
as
he
says
davies
looked
blank
but
von
br√ºning
had
turned
to
me
never
dreamed
there
would
be
thieves
among
these
islands
i
said
the
other
night
i
nearly
caught
a
fellow
in
the
act
he
thought
the
yacht
was
empty
i
described
the
affair
in
detail
and
with
what
humour
i
could
our
host
was
amused
and
apologetic
for
the
islanders
excellent
folk
he
said
they
born
with
predatory
instincts
their
fathers
made
their
living
out
of
wrecks
on
this
coast
and
the
children
inherit
a
weakness
for
plunder
when
wangeroog
lighthouse
was
built
they
petitioned
the
government
for
compensation
in
perfect
good
faith
the
coast
is
well
lighted
now
and
windfalls
are
rare
but
the
sight
of
a
stranded
yacht
with
the
owners
ashore
would
inflame
the
old
passion
and
depend
upon
it
someone
has
seen
that
the
word
had
set
me
tingling
was
it
another
test
impossible
to
say
but
audacity
was
safer
than
reserve
and
might
save
trouble
in
the
future
there
the
wreck
of
a
somewhere
farther
west
i
asked
heard
of
it
at
wangeroog
my
first
inaccuracy
said
a
company
was
exploiting
it
right
said
the
commander
without
a
sign
of
embarrassment
do
wonder
you
heard
of
it
it
one
of
the
few
things
folk
have
to
talk
about
in
these
parts
it
lies
on
juister
riff
a
shoal
off
juist
see
map
b
she
was
a
french
frigate
the
bound
from
hamburg
to
havre
in
when
napoleon
held
hamburg
as
tight
as
paris
she
carried
a
million
and
a
half
in
gold
bars
and
was
insured
in
hamburg
foundered
in
four
fathoms
broke
up
and
there
lies
the
treasure
been
raised
the
underwriters
failed
and
went
bankrupt
and
the
wreck
came
into
the
hands
of
your
english
lloyd
it
remained
their
property
till
but
they
never
got
at
the
bullion
in
fact
for
fifty
years
it
was
never
scratched
at
and
its
very
position
grew
doubtful
for
the
sand
swallowed
every
stick
the
rights
passed
through
various
hands
and
in
were
held
by
an
enterprising
swedish
company
which
brought
modern
appliances
dived
dredged
and
dug
fished
up
a
lot
of
timber
and
and
then
broke
since
then
two
hamburg
firms
have
tackled
the
job
and
lost
their
capital
scores
of
lives
have
been
spent
over
it
all
told
and
probably
a
million
of
money
still
there
are
the
bars
somewhere
what
being
done
now
recently
a
small
local
company
was
formed
it
has
a
dep√¥t
at
memmert
and
is
working
with
a
good
deal
of
perseverance
an
engineer
from
bremen
was
the
principal
mover
and
a
few
men
from
norderney
and
emden
subscribed
the
capital
by
the
way
our
friend
dollmann
is
largely
interested
in
it
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
saw
davies
face
growing
troubled
with
inward
questionings
must
get
back
to
him
i
said
laughing
not
fair
to
my
friend
but
all
this
is
very
interesting
will
they
ever
get
those
bars
that
the
point
said
von
br√ºning
with
a
mysterious
twinkle
an
undertaking
of
immense
difficulty
for
the
wreck
is
wholly
disintegrated
and
the
gold
being
the
heaviest
part
of
it
has
of
course
sunk
the
deepest
dredging
is
useless
after
a
certain
point
and
the
divers
have
to
make
excavations
in
the
sand
and
shore
them
up
as
best
they
can
every
gale
nullifies
half
their
labour
and
weather
like
this
of
the
last
fortnight
plays
the
mischief
with
the
work
only
this
morning
i
met
the
overseer
who
happens
to
be
ashore
here
he
was
as
black
as
thunder
over
prospects
it
a
romantic
speculation
i
said
deserve
a
return
for
their
money
hope
they
get
it
said
the
commander
fact
is
i
hold
a
few
shares
myself
i
hope
i
have
been
asking
indiscreet
questions
dear
no
all
the
world
knows
what
i
told
you
but
understand
that
one
has
to
be
reticent
as
to
results
in
such
a
case
it
a
big
stake
and
the
is
none
too
there
has
been
litigation
over
it
not
that
i
worry
much
about
my
investment
for
i
sha
lose
much
by
it
at
the
worst
but
it
gives
one
an
interest
in
this
abominable
coast
i
go
and
see
how
they
getting
on
sometimes
when
i
down
that
way
an
abominable
coast
i
agreed
heartily
you
get
davies
to
agree
a
magnificent
place
for
sailing
said
davies
looking
wistfully
out
over
the
grey
of
the
north
sea
he
underwent
some
more
chaff
and
the
talk
passed
to
our
cruising
adventures
in
the
baltic
and
the
estuaries
von
br√ºning
us
with
the
most
charming
urbanity
and
skill
nothing
he
asked
could
cause
us
the
slightest
offence
and
a
responsive
frankness
was
our
only
possible
course
so
date
after
date
and
incident
after
incident
were
elicited
in
the
most
natural
way
as
we
talked
i
was
astonished
to
find
how
little
there
was
that
was
worth
concealing
and
heartily
thankful
that
we
had
decided
on
candour
my
fluency
gave
me
the
lead
and
davies
followed
me
but
his
own
personality
was
really
our
tower
of
strength
i
realized
that
as
i
watched
the
play
of
his
eager
features
and
heard
him
struggle
for
expression
on
his
favourite
hobby
all
his
pet
phrases
translated
crudely
into
the
most
excruciating
german
he
was
convincing
because
he
was
himself
there
many
like
you
in
england
asked
von
br√ºning
once
me
of
course
lots
said
davies
wish
there
were
more
in
germany
they
play
at
yachting
over
here
on
shore
half
the
time
drinking
and
loafing
paid
crews
clean
hands
white
trousers
laid
up
in
the
middle
of
september
have
seen
many
yachts
about
said
davies
politely
for
my
part
i
made
no
pretence
of
being
a
davies
faithful
to
my
lower
nature
i
vowed
the
germans
were
right
and
not
without
a
secret
zest
drew
a
lurid
picture
of
the
horrors
of
crewless
cruising
and
the
drudgery
that
my
remorseless
skipper
inflicted
on
me
it
was
delightful
to
see
davies
wincing
when
i
described
my
first
night
at
flensburg
for
i
had
my
revenge
at
last
and
did
not
spare
him
he
bore
up
gallantly
under
my
jesting
but
i
knew
very
well
by
his
manner
that
he
had
not
forgiven
me
my
banter
about
the
daughter
speak
german
well
said
von
br√ºning
have
lived
in
germany
said
i
for
a
profession
i
suppose
said
i
thinking
ahead
service
was
my
prepared
answer
to
the
next
question
but
again
morbidly
perhaps
i
saw
a
pitfall
that
letter
from
my
chief
awaiting
me
at
norderney
my
name
was
known
and
we
were
watched
it
might
be
opened
lord
how
casual
we
have
been
i
ask
what
foreign
office
it
sounded
suspicious
but
there
it
was
in
the
government
service
when
do
you
have
to
be
back
that
was
how
the
question
of
our
future
intentions
was
raised
prematurely
by
me
for
two
conflicting
theories
were
clashing
in
my
brain
but
the
contents
of
the
letter
dogged
me
now
and
at
a
loss
tell
the
truth
was
an
axiom
i
was
finding
sound
so
i
answered
soon
in
about
a
week
but
i
expecting
a
letter
at
norderney
which
may
give
me
an
extension
davies
said
it
was
a
good
address
to
give
i
added
smiling
said
von
br√ºning
dryly
the
joke
had
apparently
ceased
to
amuse
him
you
have
much
time
then
have
you
he
added
you
leave
your
skipper
in
the
lurch
it
a
long
way
to
england
and
the
season
is
late
for
yachts
i
felt
myself
being
hurried
you
do
understand
i
explained
in
no
hurry
he
a
man
of
leisure
are
you
davies
said
davies
i
translated
my
cruel
question
said
davies
with
simple
pathos
i
have
to
leave
him
i
sha
be
missed
as
an
able
seaman
at
least
he
just
potter
on
down
the
islands
running
aground
and
and
arrive
about
christmas
take
the
first
fair
gale
to
dover
laughed
the
commander
that
so
you
see
we
in
no
hurry
and
we
never
make
plans
and
as
for
a
passage
to
england
straight
i
not
such
a
coward
as
i
was
at
first
but
i
draw
the
line
at
that
a
curious
pair
of
shipmates
what
your
point
of
view
herr
davies
like
this
coast
said
davies
we
want
to
shoot
some
ducks
he
was
nervous
and
forgot
himself
i
had
already
satirized
our
sporting
armament
and
exploits
and
hoped
the
subject
was
disposed
of
ducks
were
pretexts
and
might
lead
to
complications
i
particularly
wanted
a
free
hand
to
wild
fowl
said
our
friend
would
like
to
give
you
gentlemen
some
advice
there
are
plenty
to
be
got
now
that
autumn
weather
has
set
in
you
would
have
got
a
shot
in
september
herr
davies
i
remember
your
asking
about
them
when
i
saw
you
last
and
even
now
it
early
for
amateurs
in
hard
winter
weather
a
child
can
pick
them
up
but
they
wild
still
and
want
crafty
hunting
you
want
a
local
punt
and
above
all
a
local
man
you
could
stow
him
in
your
and
to
go
to
work
seriously
now
if
you
really
wish
for
sport
i
could
help
you
i
could
get
you
a
trustworthy
it
too
good
of
you
stammered
davies
in
a
more
unhappy
accent
than
usual
can
easily
find
one
for
ourselves
a
man
at
wangeroog
offered
did
he
interrupted
von
br√ºning
laughing
not
surprised
you
do
know
the
frieslanders
they
guileless
as
i
said
but
they
cling
to
their
little
perquisites
i
translated
to
davies
been
cheated
out
of
wrecks
and
they
all
the
more
sensitive
about
ducks
which
are
more
lucrative
than
fish
a
stranger
is
a
poacher
your
man
would
have
made
slight
errors
as
to
time
and
place
said
they
were
odd
in
their
manner
did
you
davies
i
put
in
here
this
is
very
kind
of
commander
von
br√ºning
but
had
we
better
be
certain
of
my
plans
before
settling
down
to
shoot
let
push
on
direct
to
norderney
and
get
that
letter
of
mine
and
then
decide
but
we
sha
see
you
again
i
suppose
commander
not
i
am
cruising
westwards
and
shall
probably
call
at
norderney
come
aboard
if
you
there
wo
you
i
should
like
to
show
you
the
very
much
said
davies
uneasily
very
much
said
i
as
heartily
as
i
could
our
party
broke
up
soon
after
this
gentlemen
i
must
take
leave
of
you
said
our
friend
have
to
drive
to
esens
i
shall
be
going
back
to
the
on
the
evening
tide
but
you
be
busy
then
with
your
own
boat
it
had
been
a
puzzling
interview
but
the
greatest
puzzle
was
still
to
come
as
we
went
towards
the
door
von
br√ºning
made
a
sign
to
me
we
let
davies
pass
out
and
remained
standing
word
in
confidence
with
you
herr
carruthers
he
said
speaking
low
wo
think
me
officious
i
hope
i
only
speak
out
of
keen
regard
for
your
friend
it
is
about
the
dollmanns
you
see
how
the
land
lies
i
would
encourage
him
i
said
really
only
a
hint
he
a
splendid
young
fellow
but
if
anything
you
understand
too
honest
and
simple
i
take
it
you
have
influence
with
him
and
i
should
use
it
was
not
in
earnest
i
said
have
never
seen
the
dollmanns
i
thought
they
were
friends
of
yours
i
added
looking
him
straight
in
the
eyes
know
them
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
know
everybody
wrong
with
them
i
said
herr
carruthers
remember
i
speak
out
of
pure
friendliness
to
you
as
strangers
foreigners
and
young
you
i
take
to
have
discretion
or
i
should
not
have
said
a
word
still
i
will
add
this
we
know
very
little
of
herr
dollmann
of
his
origin
his
antecedents
he
is
half
a
swede
i
believe
certainly
not
a
prussian
came
to
norderney
three
years
ago
appears
to
be
rich
and
has
joined
in
various
commercial
undertakings
little
scope
about
here
oh
there
is
more
enterprise
than
you
think
development
of
bathing
resorts
you
know
speculation
in
land
on
these
islands
sharp
practice
oh
no
he
perfectly
straight
in
that
way
but
he
a
queer
fellow
of
eccentric
habits
and
and
well
as
i
say
little
is
known
of
him
that
all
just
a
warning
come
along
i
saw
that
to
press
him
further
was
useless
i
remember
i
said
look
here
he
added
as
we
walked
down
the
passage
you
take
my
advice
you
omit
that
visit
to
the
altogether
he
gave
me
a
steady
look
smiling
gravely
much
do
you
know
and
what
do
you
mean
were
the
questions
that
throbbed
in
my
thoughts
but
i
could
not
utter
them
so
i
said
nothing
and
felt
very
young
outside
we
joined
davies
who
was
knitting
his
brow
over
prospects
just
comes
of
going
into
places
like
this
he
said
to
me
may
be
stuck
here
for
days
too
much
wind
to
tow
out
with
the
dinghy
and
too
narrow
a
channel
to
beat
in
von
br√ºning
was
ready
with
a
new
proposal
did
i
think
of
it
before
he
said
tow
you
out
in
my
launch
be
ready
at
we
shall
have
water
enough
then
my
men
will
send
you
a
warp
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
but
a
sense
of
being
personally
conducted
again
oppressed
me
and
the
last
hope
of
a
bed
in
the
inn
vanished
davies
was
none
too
effusive
either
a
tug
meant
a
pilot
and
he
had
had
enough
of
them
objects
to
towage
on
principle
i
said
like
him
laughed
the
other
settled
then
a
dogcart
was
standing
before
the
inn
door
in
readiness
for
von
br√ºning
i
was
curious
about
esens
and
his
business
there
esens
he
said
was
the
principal
town
of
the
district
four
miles
inland
have
to
go
there
he
volunteered
a
poaching
case
a
dutchman
trawling
inside
our
limits
that
my
work
you
know
police
duty
had
the
words
a
deeper
meaning
you
ever
catch
an
englishman
i
asked
recklessly
very
rarely
your
countrymen
do
come
so
far
as
this
except
on
pleasure
he
bowed
to
us
each
and
smiled
much
of
that
to
be
got
in
bensersiel
i
laughed
afraid
you
have
a
dull
afternoon
look
here
i
know
you
leave
your
boat
altogether
and
it
no
use
asking
herr
davies
but
will
drive
into
esens
with
me
and
see
a
frisian
town
for
what
it
worth
you
getting
a
dismal
impression
of
friesland
i
excused
myself
said
i
would
stop
with
davies
we
would
walk
out
over
the
sands
and
prospect
for
the
evening
sail
then
he
said
the
evening
be
ready
for
the
warp
at
he
jumped
up
and
the
cart
rattled
off
through
the
mud
crossed
the
bridge
and
disappeared
into
the
dreary
hinterland
xvii
clearing
the
air
he
gone
to
get
the
police
do
you
think
said
davies
grimly
do
think
so
said
i
go
aboard
before
that
customs
fellow
buttonholes
us
a
diminished
row
of
stolid
frisians
still
ruminated
over
the
friend
grimm
was
visible
smoking
on
his
forecastle
we
went
on
board
in
silence
of
all
where
exactly
is
memmert
i
said
davies
pulled
down
the
chart
said
and
flung
himself
at
full
length
on
a
sofa
the
reader
can
see
memmert
for
himself
south
of
juist
see
map
b
abutting
on
the
ems
delta
lies
an
extensive
sandbank
called
nordland
whose
extreme
western
rim
remains
uncovered
at
the
highest
tides
the
effect
being
to
leave
a
island
a
mere
paring
of
sand
like
a
boomerang
nearly
two
miles
long
but
only
yards
or
so
broad
of
curiously
symmetrical
outline
except
at
one
spot
where
it
bulges
to
the
width
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
the
english
chart
its
nakedness
was
absolute
save
for
a
beacon
at
the
south
but
the
german
chart
marked
a
building
at
the
point
where
the
bulge
occurs
this
was
evidently
the
dep√¥t
living
there
i
thought
for
the
very
name
struck
cold
no
wonder
grimm
was
grim
and
no
wonder
he
was
used
to
seek
change
of
air
but
the
advantages
of
the
site
were
obvious
it
was
remarkably
isolated
even
in
a
region
where
isolation
is
the
rule
yet
it
was
conveniently
near
the
wreck
which
as
we
had
heard
lay
two
miles
out
on
the
juister
reef
lastly
it
was
clearly
accessible
at
any
state
of
the
tide
for
the
channel
of
the
ems
estuary
runs
hard
up
to
it
on
the
south
and
thence
sends
off
an
eastward
branch
which
closely
borders
the
southern
horn
thus
offering
an
anchorage
at
once
handy
deep
and
sheltered
from
seaward
gales
such
was
memmert
as
i
saw
it
on
the
chart
taking
in
its
features
mechanically
for
while
davies
lay
there
heedless
and
taciturn
a
pretence
of
interest
was
useless
i
knew
perfectly
well
what
was
between
us
but
i
did
not
see
why
i
should
make
the
first
move
for
i
had
a
grievance
too
an
old
one
so
i
sat
back
on
my
sofa
and
jotted
down
in
my
notebook
the
heads
of
our
conversation
at
the
inn
while
it
was
fresh
in
my
memory
and
strove
to
draw
conclusions
but
the
silence
continuing
and
becoming
absurd
i
threw
my
pride
to
the
winds
and
my
notebook
on
the
table
say
davies
i
said
awfully
sorry
i
chaffed
you
about
fr√§ulein
dollmann
no
answer
you
see
i
could
help
it
wish
to
heaven
we
had
never
come
in
here
he
said
in
a
hard
voice
comes
of
landing
i
could
help
smiling
at
this
but
he
was
looking
at
me
we
are
given
away
moved
on
taken
in
charge
arranged
for
like
cook
tourists
i
follow
your
game
too
infernally
deep
for
me
but
that
stung
me
here
i
said
did
my
best
it
was
you
that
muddled
it
why
did
you
harp
on
ducks
could
have
got
out
of
that
why
did
you
harp
on
everything
idiotic
your
letter
the
foreign
office
the
the
wreck
the
utterly
unreasonable
did
you
see
what
traps
there
were
i
was
driven
the
way
i
went
we
started
unprepared
and
we
jolly
well
out
of
it
davies
drove
on
blindly
was
bad
enough
telling
all
about
the
channels
and
exploring
you
agreed
to
that
yourself
gave
in
to
you
we
ca
explore
any
more
now
the
wreck
though
hang
the
wreck
it
all
a
blind
or
he
would
have
made
so
much
of
it
there
are
all
these
channels
to
be
hang
the
channels
i
know
we
wanted
a
free
hand
but
we
got
to
go
to
norderney
some
time
and
if
dollmann
away
did
you
harp
on
miss
dollmann
said
davies
we
had
worked
round
through
idle
recrimination
to
the
real
point
of
departure
i
knew
davies
was
not
himself
and
would
not
return
to
himself
till
the
heart
of
the
matter
was
reached
here
i
said
brought
me
out
here
to
help
you
because
as
you
say
i
was
clever
talked
german
and
liked
yachting
i
could
resist
adding
this
but
directly
you
really
me
you
turn
round
and
go
for
me
i
did
mean
all
that
really
said
davies
sorry
i
was
worried
know
but
it
your
own
fault
you
have
been
fair
with
me
there
a
complication
in
this
business
that
you
never
talked
about
i
never
pressed
you
because
i
thought
you
would
confide
in
me
you
know
i
have
said
davies
you
see
the
result
our
hand
was
forced
to
have
said
nothing
about
dollmann
was
folly
to
have
said
he
tried
to
wreck
you
was
equal
folly
the
story
we
agreed
on
was
the
best
and
safest
and
you
told
it
splendidly
but
for
two
reasons
i
had
to
harp
on
the
daughter
one
because
your
manner
when
they
were
mentioned
was
so
confused
as
to
imperil
our
whole
position
two
because
your
story
though
the
safest
was
at
the
best
suspicious
even
on
your
own
showing
dollmann
treated
you
badly
discourteously
say
though
you
pretended
not
to
have
seen
it
you
want
a
motive
to
neutralize
that
and
induce
you
to
revisit
him
in
a
friendly
way
i
supplied
it
or
rather
i
only
encouraged
von
br√ºning
to
supply
it
revisit
him
after
all
said
davies
come
do
you
see
what
a
hideous
fix
you
put
me
in
how
caddish
i
feel
about
it
i
did
see
and
i
felt
a
cad
myself
as
his
full
distress
came
home
to
me
but
i
felt
too
that
whosesoever
the
fault
we
had
drifted
into
a
ridiculous
situation
and
were
like
characters
in
one
of
those
tiresome
plays
where
misunderstandings
are
manufactured
and
so
carefully
sustained
that
the
audience
are
too
bored
to
wait
for
the
you
can
do
that
on
the
stage
but
we
wanted
our
very
sorry
i
said
i
wish
you
had
told
me
all
about
it
wo
you
now
just
the
bare
truth
i
hate
sentiment
and
so
do
you
find
it
very
difficult
to
tell
people
things
said
davies
like
this
i
waited
did
like
her
very
much
our
eyes
met
for
a
second
in
which
all
was
said
that
need
be
said
as
between
two
of
our
phlegmatic
race
she
separate
from
him
that
was
the
reason
of
all
my
indecisions
he
hurried
on
only
told
you
half
at
schlei
i
know
i
ought
to
have
been
open
and
asked
your
advice
but
i
let
it
slide
i
been
hoping
all
along
that
we
might
find
what
we
want
and
win
the
game
without
coming
to
close
quarters
again
i
no
longer
wondered
at
his
devotion
to
the
channel
theory
since
built
on
conviction
it
was
thus
doubly
fortified
you
always
knew
what
might
happen
i
said
schlei
you
spoke
of
settling
with
dollmann
know
when
i
thought
of
him
i
was
mad
i
made
myself
forget
the
other
part
recurred
at
brunsb√ºttel
i
thought
of
the
news
we
had
there
we
must
have
no
more
secrets
i
going
to
speak
out
are
you
sure
you
not
misunderstood
her
you
say
and
i
willing
to
assume
it
that
dollmann
a
traitor
and
a
murderer
hang
the
murder
part
said
davies
impatiently
does
matter
traitor
very
good
but
in
that
case
i
suspect
his
daughter
no
let
me
go
on
she
was
useful
to
say
the
least
she
encouraged
you
you
told
me
that
to
make
that
passage
with
them
carruthers
said
davies
firmly
know
you
mean
kindly
but
it
no
use
i
believe
in
her
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
case
i
said
something
to
propose
when
we
get
out
of
this
place
let
sail
straight
away
to
england
there
commander
von
br√ºning
i
thought
never
can
say
i
neglected
your
advice
exclaimed
davies
starting
up
and
facing
me
hanged
if
we
will
think
what
at
stake
think
of
that
traitor
plotting
with
germans
my
god
good
i
said
with
you
for
going
on
but
let
face
facts
we
scotch
dollmann
we
ca
do
so
without
hurting
we
course
not
be
sensible
man
face
that
next
point
it
absurd
to
hope
that
we
need
not
revisit
them
it
ten
to
one
that
we
must
if
we
to
succeed
his
attempt
on
you
is
the
whole
foundation
of
our
suspicions
and
we
do
even
know
for
certain
who
he
yet
we
committed
i
know
to
going
straight
to
norderney
now
but
even
if
we
were
should
we
do
any
good
by
exploring
and
prying
very
doubtful
we
know
we
watched
if
not
suspected
and
that
disposes
of
of
our
power
the
channels
yes
but
is
it
likely
they
let
us
learn
them
by
heart
if
they
of
such
vital
importance
even
if
we
are
thought
to
be
yachtsmen
and
seriously
apart
from
their
value
in
war
which
i
do
deny
are
they
at
the
root
of
this
business
but
we
talk
about
that
in
a
moment
the
point
now
is
what
shall
we
do
if
we
meet
the
dollmanns
beads
of
sweat
stood
on
davies
brow
i
felt
like
a
torturer
but
it
could
not
be
helped
him
with
having
wrecked
you
our
quest
would
be
at
an
end
we
must
be
friendly
you
must
tell
the
story
you
told
and
chance
his
believing
it
if
he
does
so
much
the
better
if
he
does
he
wo
dare
say
so
and
we
still
have
chances
we
gain
time
and
have
a
tremendous
hold
on
him
friendly
davies
winced
i
gave
another
turn
to
the
screw
with
them
of
course
you
were
before
you
know
you
liked
her
very
much
you
must
seem
to
still
stop
your
infernal
logic
we
chuck
it
and
go
to
england
i
asked
again
as
an
inquisitor
might
say
you
had
enough
no
answer
i
went
on
make
it
easier
you
like
her
still
i
had
roused
my
victim
at
last
the
devil
do
you
mean
carruthers
that
i
to
trade
on
my
liking
for
her
on
her
innocence
to
good
god
what
you
mean
no
not
that
i
not
such
a
cad
or
such
a
fool
or
so
ignorant
of
you
if
she
knows
nothing
of
her
father
character
and
likes
you
and
you
like
her
and
you
are
what
you
are
oh
heavens
man
face
it
realize
it
but
what
i
mean
is
this
is
she
she
be
what
you
think
imagine
his
position
if
we
right
about
him
the
vilest
creature
on
god
earth
a
disgraceful
past
to
have
been
driven
to
this
in
the
pay
of
germany
i
want
to
spare
you
misery
i
was
going
to
add
if
you
on
your
guard
to
increase
our
chances
but
the
utter
futility
of
such
suggestions
silenced
me
what
a
plan
i
had
foreshadowed
an
enticing
plan
and
a
fair
one
too
as
against
such
adversaries
turning
this
baffling
to
advantage
as
many
a
time
we
had
worked
eddies
of
an
adverse
tide
in
these
difficult
seas
but
davies
was
davies
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
his
faith
and
simplicity
shamed
me
and
the
pity
of
it
the
cruelty
of
it
was
that
his
very
qualities
were
his
last
torture
raising
to
the
acutest
pitch
the
conflict
between
love
and
patriotism
remember
that
the
latter
was
his
dominant
and
that
here
and
now
was
his
chance
if
you
would
gauge
the
bitterness
of
that
conflict
it
was
in
its
last
throes
now
his
elbows
were
on
the
table
and
his
twitching
hands
pressed
on
his
forehead
he
took
them
away
course
we
must
go
on
it
ca
be
helped
that
all
you
believe
in
her
remember
what
you
said
there
may
be
some
way
out
and
rather
not
talk
about
that
any
more
what
about
the
wreck
further
argument
was
futile
davies
by
an
effort
seemed
to
sweep
the
subject
from
his
thoughts
and
i
did
my
best
to
do
the
same
at
any
rate
the
air
was
cleared
we
were
friends
and
it
only
remained
to
grapple
with
the
main
problem
in
the
light
of
the
interview
every
word
that
i
could
recollect
of
that
critical
conversation
i
reviewed
with
davies
who
had
imperfectly
understood
what
he
had
not
been
directly
concerned
in
and
as
i
did
so
i
began
to
see
with
what
cleverness
each
succeeding
sentence
of
von
br√ºning
was
designed
to
suit
both
of
two
contingencies
if
we
were
innocent
travellers
he
was
the
genial
host
communicative
and
helpful
if
we
were
spies
his
tactics
had
been
equally
applicable
he
had
outdone
us
in
apparent
candour
hiding
nothing
which
he
knew
we
would
discover
for
ourselves
and
contriving
at
the
same
time
both
to
gain
knowledge
and
control
of
our
movements
and
to
convey
us
warnings
which
would
only
be
understood
if
we
were
guilty
that
we
were
playing
an
idle
and
perilous
game
and
had
better
desist
but
in
one
respect
we
had
had
the
advantage
and
that
was
in
the
version
davies
had
given
of
his
stranding
on
the
hohenh√∂rn
inscrutable
as
our
questioner
was
he
let
it
appear
not
only
that
the
incident
was
new
to
him
but
that
he
conjectured
at
its
sinister
significance
a
little
on
detail
would
have
been
fatal
to
version
but
that
was
where
our
strength
lay
he
dared
not
for
fear
of
suggesting
to
davies
suspicions
which
he
might
never
have
felt
indeed
i
thought
i
detected
that
fear
underlying
his
whole
attitude
towards
us
and
it
strengthened
a
conviction
which
had
been
growing
in
me
since
grimm
furtive
midnight
visit
that
the
secret
of
this
coast
was
of
so
important
and
delicate
a
nature
that
rather
than
attract
attention
to
it
at
all
overt
action
against
intruders
would
be
taken
only
in
the
last
resort
and
on
irrefragable
proofs
of
guilty
intention
now
for
our
clues
i
had
come
away
with
two
each
the
germ
of
a
distinct
theory
and
both
obscured
by
the
prevailing
ambiguity
now
however
as
we
thumbed
the
chart
and
i
gave
full
rein
to
my
fancy
one
of
them
the
idea
of
memmert
gained
precision
and
vigour
every
moment
true
such
information
as
we
had
about
the
french
wreck
and
his
own
connection
with
it
was
placed
most
readily
at
our
disposal
by
von
br√ºning
but
i
took
it
to
be
information
calculated
only
to
forestall
suspicion
since
he
was
aware
that
we
already
associated
him
with
dollmann
possibly
also
with
grimm
and
it
was
only
likely
that
in
the
ordinary
course
we
should
learn
that
the
trio
were
jointly
concerned
in
memmert
so
much
for
the
facts
as
for
the
construction
he
wished
us
to
put
on
them
i
felt
sure
it
was
absolutely
false
he
wished
to
give
us
the
impression
that
the
buried
treasure
itself
was
at
the
root
of
any
mystery
we
might
have
scented
i
do
not
know
if
the
reader
fully
appreciated
that
astute
suggestion
the
hint
that
secrecy
as
to
results
was
necessary
owing
both
to
the
great
sum
at
stake
and
the
flaw
in
the
title
which
he
had
been
careful
to
inform
us
had
passed
through
british
hands
what
he
meant
to
imply
was
be
surprised
if
you
have
midnight
visitors
englishmen
prowling
along
this
coast
are
suspected
of
being
lloyd
agents
an
ingenious
insinuation
which
at
the
time
it
was
made
had
caused
me
to
contemplate
a
new
and
much
more
commonplace
solution
of
our
enigma
than
had
ever
occurred
to
us
but
it
was
only
a
passing
doubt
and
i
dismissed
it
altogether
now
the
fact
was
it
either
explained
everything
or
nothing
as
long
as
we
held
to
our
fundamental
assumption
that
davies
had
been
decoyed
into
a
in
september
it
explained
nothing
it
was
too
fantastic
to
suppose
that
the
exigencies
of
a
commercial
speculation
would
lead
to
such
extremities
as
that
we
were
not
in
the
south
sea
islands
nor
were
we
the
puppets
of
a
romance
we
were
in
europe
dealing
not
only
with
a
dollmann
but
with
an
officer
of
the
german
imperial
navy
who
would
scarcely
be
connected
with
a
commercial
enterprise
which
could
conceivably
be
reduced
to
forwarding
its
objects
in
such
a
fashion
it
was
shocking
enough
to
find
him
in
relations
with
such
a
scoundrel
at
all
but
it
was
explicable
if
the
motive
were
imperial
not
so
if
it
were
financial
no
to
accept
the
suggestion
we
must
declare
the
whole
quest
a
mare
nest
from
beginning
to
end
the
attempt
on
davies
a
delusion
of
his
own
fancy
the
whole
structure
we
had
built
on
it
baseless
i
can
hear
the
reader
saying
not
you
at
any
rate
were
always
a
little
sceptical
granted
yet
i
can
truthfully
say
i
scarcely
faltered
for
a
moment
much
had
happened
since
schlei
fiord
i
had
seen
the
mechanism
of
the
i
had
lived
with
davies
for
a
stormy
fortnight
every
hour
of
which
had
increased
my
reliance
on
his
seamanship
and
also
therefore
on
his
account
of
an
event
which
depended
largely
for
its
correct
interpretation
on
a
balanced
nautical
judgement
finally
i
had
been
unconsciously
realizing
and
knew
from
his
mouth
that
he
had
exercised
and
acted
on
that
judgement
in
the
teeth
of
personal
considerations
which
his
loyal
nature
made
overwhelming
in
their
force
what
then
was
the
meaning
of
memmert
at
the
outset
it
riveted
my
attention
on
the
ems
estuary
whose
mouth
it
adjoins
we
had
always
rather
neglected
the
ems
in
our
calculations
with
some
excuse
too
for
at
first
sight
its
importance
bears
no
proportion
to
that
of
the
three
greater
estuaries
the
latter
bear
vessels
of
the
largest
tonnage
and
deepest
draught
to
the
very
quays
of
hamburg
bremerhaven
and
the
naval
dockyard
of
wilhelmshaven
while
two
of
them
the
elbe
and
the
weser
are
commerce
carriers
on
the
vastest
scale
for
the
whole
empire
the
ems
on
the
other
hand
only
serves
towns
of
the
second
class
a
glance
at
the
chart
explains
this
you
see
a
most
imposing
estuary
on
a
grander
scale
than
any
of
the
other
three
taken
singly
with
a
length
of
thirty
miles
and
a
frontage
on
the
north
sea
of
ten
miles
or
roughly
of
the
whole
seaboard
encumbered
by
outlying
shoals
and
blocked
in
the
centre
by
the
island
of
borkum
but
presenting
two
fine
channels
to
the
incoming
vessel
these
roll
superbly
through
enormous
sheets
of
sand
unite
and
approach
the
mainland
in
one
stately
stream
three
miles
in
breadth
but
then
comes
a
sad
falling
off
the
navigable
fairway
shoals
and
shrinks
middle
grounds
obstruct
it
and
shelving
foreshores
persistently
deny
it
that
easy
access
to
the
land
that
alone
can
create
great
seaboard
cities
all
the
ports
of
the
ems
are
tidal
the
harbour
of
delfzyl
on
the
dutch
side
dries
at
low
water
and
emden
the
principal
german
port
can
only
be
reached
by
a
lock
and
a
mile
of
canal
but
this
depreciation
is
only
relative
judged
on
its
merits
and
not
by
the
standard
of
the
elbe
it
is
a
very
important
river
emden
is
a
flourishing
and
growing
port
for
shallow
craft
the
stream
is
navigable
far
into
the
interior
where
aided
by
tributaries
and
allied
canals
notably
the
connection
with
the
rhine
at
dortmund
then
approaching
completion
it
taps
the
resources
of
a
great

strategically
there
was
still
less
reason
for
underrating
it
it

one
of
the
great
maritime
gates
of

and
it
is
the
westernmost
gate
the
nearest
to

britain
and
france
contiguous
to
holland
its
great
forked
delta
presents
two
yawning
breaches
in
that
singular
rampart
of
islets
and
shoals
which
masks
the
german
seaboard
a
seaboard
itself
so
short
in
proportion
to
the
empire
bulk
that
as
davies
used
to
say
inch
of
it
must
be
important
warships
could
force
these
breaches
and
so
threaten
the
mainland
at
one
of
its
few
vulnerable
points
quay

no
object
to
such
visitors
intricate

the

approach

distance
of

while

and
military
transports
could
penetrate
to
the
level
of
emden
itself
emden
as
davies
had
often
pointed
out
is
connected
by
canal
with
wilhelmshaven
on
the
jade
a
strategic
canal
designed
to
carry
gunboats
as
well
as
merchandise
now
memmert
was
part
of
the
outer
rampart
its
tapering
sickle
of
sand
directly
commanded
the
eastern
breach
it
be
connected
with
the
defence
of
this
breach
no
more
admirable
base
could
be
imagined
and
isolated
yet
sheltered
accessible
better
than
juist
and
borkum
and
supposing
it
were
desired
to
shroud
the
nature
of
the
work
in
absolute
secrecy
what
a
pretext
lay
to
hand
in
the
wreck
and
its
buried
bullion
which
lay
in
the
offing
opposite
the
fairway
on
memmert
was
the
dep√¥t
for
the
salvage
operations
salvage
work
with
its
dredging
and
diving
offered
precisely
the
disguise
that
was
needed
it
was
submarine
and
so
are
some
of
the
most
important
defences
of
ports
mines
and
dirigible
torpedoes
all
the
details
of
the
story
were
suggestive
the
local
company
the
from
bremen
who
i
wondered
was
he
the
few
shares
held
by
von
br√ºning
enough
to
explain
his
visits
the
stores
and
gear
coming
from
wilhelmshaven
a
naval
dockyard
try
as
i
would
i
could
not
stir
davies
imagination
as
mine
was
stirred
he
was
bent
on
only
seeing
the
objections
which
of
course
were
numerous
enough
could
secrecy
be
ensured
under
pretext
of
salving
a
wreck
it
must
be
a
secret
shared
by
many
divers
crews
of
tugs
employees
of
all
sorts
i
answered
that
trade
secrets
are
often
preserved
under
no
less
difficult
conditions
and
why
not
imperial
secrets
the
ems
and
not
the
elbe
he
asked
i
replied
elbe
too
holds
similar
mysteries
neuerk
island
might
for
all
we
knew
be
another
memmert
when
cruising
in
that
region
we
had
had
no
eyes
for
such
things
absorbed
in
a
preconceived
theory
of
our
own
besides
we
must
not
take
ourselves
too
seriously
we
were
amateurs
not
experts
in
coast
defence
and
on
such
vague
grounds
to
fastidiously
reject
a
clue
which
went
so
far
as
this
one
was
to
quarrel
with
our
luck
there
was
a
disheartening
corollary
to
this
latter
argument
that
in
my
zeal
i
shut
my
eyes
to
as
amateurs
were
we
capable
of
using
our
clue
and
gaining
exact
knowledge
of
the
defences
in
question
davies
i
knew
felt
this
strongly
and
i
think
it
accounted
for
his
lukewarm
view
of
memmert
more
than
he
was
aware
he
clung
more
obstinately
than
ever
to
his
theory
conscious
that
it
offered
the
one
sort
of
opportunity
of
which
with
his
peculiar
gifts
he
was
able
to
take
advantage
he
admitted
however
that
it
was
under
a
cloud
at
present
for
if
knowledge
of
the
coastwise
navigation
were
a
crime
in
itself
we
should
scarcely
be
sitting
here
now
something
to
do
with
it
anyhow
he
persisted
xviii
imperial
escort
memmert
gripped
me
then
to
the
exclusion
of
a
rival
notion
which
had
given
me
no
little
perplexity
during
the
conversation
with
von
br√ºning
his
reiterated
advice
that
we
should
lose
no
time
in
picking
up
our
anchor
and
chain
had
ended
by
giving
me
the
idea
that
he
was
anxious
to
get
us
away
from
bensersiel
and
the
mainland
at
first
i
had
taken
the
advice
partly
as
a
test
of
our
veracity
as
i
gave
the
reader
to
understand
and
partly
as
an
indirect
method
of
lulling
any
suspicions
which
grimm
midnight
visit
may
have
caused
then
it
struck
me
that
this
might
be
on
my
part
and
the
idea
recurred
when
the
question
of
our
future
plans
cropped
up
and
hampered
me
in
deciding
on
a
course
it
returned
again
when
von
br√ºning
offered
to
tow
us
out
in
the
evening
it
was
in
my
mind
when
i
questioned
him
as
to
his
business
ashore
for
it
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
his
landing
here
was
not
solely
due
to
a
wish
to
inspect
the
crew
of
the
then
came
his
perfectly
frank
explanation
with
its
sinister
for
us
coupled
with
an
invitation
to
me
to
accompany
him
to
esens
but
on
the
principle
of
i
instantly
smelt
a
ruse
not
that
i
dreamt
that
i
was
to
be
decoyed
into
captivity
but
if
there
was
anything
here
which
we
two
might
discover
in
the
few
hours
left
to
us
it
was
an
ingenious
plan
to
remove
the
most
observant
of
the
two
till
the
hour
of
departure
davies
scorned
them
and
i
had
felt
only
a
faint
curiosity
in
these
insignificant
hamlets
influenced
i
am
afraid
chiefly
by
a
hankering
after
which
the
pitiless
rigour
of
his
training
had
been
unable
to
cure
but
it
was
imprudent
to
neglect
the
slightest
chance
it
was
three
and
i
think
both
our
brains
were
beginning
to
be
addled
with
thinking
in
close
confinement
i
suggested
that
we
should
finish
our
council
of
war
in
the
open
and
we
both
donned
oilskins
and
turned
out
the
sky
had
hardened
and
banked
into
an
even
canopy
of
lead
and
the
wind
drove
before
it
a
fine
cold
rain
you
could
hear
the
murmur
of
the
rising
flood
on
the
sands
outside
but
the
harbour
was
high
above
it
still
and
the
and
the
other
boats
squatted
low
in
a
bed
of
black
slime
native
interest
seemed
to
be
at
last
assuaged
for
not
a
soul
was
visible
on
the
bank
i
can
not
call
it
a
quay
but
the
top
of
a
black
with
a
feather
of
smoke
curling
round
it
showed
above
the
forehatch
of
the
wish
i
could
get
a
look
at
your
cargo
my
friend
i
thought
to
myself
we
gazed
at
bensersiel
in
silence
ca
be
anything
i
said
there
be
said
davies
about
that
dyke
i
said
with
a
sudden
inspiration
from
the
bank
we
could
see
all
along
the
which
is
dyked
continuously
as
i
have
already
said
the
dyke
was
here
a
substantial
embankment
very
similar
though
on
a
smaller
scale
to
that
which
had
bordered
the
elbe
near
cuxhaven
and
over
whose
summit
we
had
seen
the
snouts
of
guns
say
davies
i
said
you
think
this
coast
could
be
invaded
along
here
i
mean
behind
these
islands
davies
shook
his
head
thought
of
that
he
said
nothing
in
it
it
just
the
very
last
place
on
earth
where
a
landing
would
be
possible
no
transport
could
get
nearer
than
where
the
is
lying
four
miles
out
you
say
every
inch
of
this
coast
is
important
but
it
the
i
mean
i
want
to
see
that
dyke
let
walk
along
it
my
mushroom
theory
died
directly
i
set
foot
on
it
it
was
the
most
innocent
structure
in
the
world
like
a
thousand
others
in
essex
and
holland
topped
by
a
narrow
path
where
we
walked
in
single
file
with
arms
akimbo
to
keep
our
balance
in
the
gusts
of
wind
below
us
lay
the
sands
on
one
side
and
rank
fens
on
the
other
interspersed
with
squares
of
pasture
ringed
in
with
ditches
after
half
a
mile
we
dropped
down
and
came
back
by
a
short
circuit
inland
following
a
mazy
path
which
was
mostly
right
angles
and
minute
plank
bridges
till
we
came
to
the
esens
road
we
crossed
this
and
soon
after
found
our
way
barred
by
the
stream
i
spoke
of
this
involved
a
to
the
bridge
in
the
village
and
a
stealthy
avoidance
of
the
for
dread
of
its
garrulous
occupant
then
we
followed
the
dyke
in
the
other
direction
and
ended
by
a
circuit
over
the
sands
which
were
fast
being
covered
by
the
tide
and
so
back
to
the
yacht
nobody
appeared
to
have
taken
the
slightest
notice
of
our
movements
as
we
walked
we
had
tackled
the
last
question
are
we
to
do
and
found
very
little
to
say
on
it
we
were
to
leave
unless
the
esens
police
appeared
on
the
scene
and
were
committed
to
sailing
direct
to
norderney
as
the
only
alternative
to
duck
shooting
under
the
espionage
of
a
nominee
of
von
br√ºning
beyond
that
vagueness
and
difficulty
of
every
sort
at
norderney
i
should
be
fettered
by
my
letter
if
it
seemed
to
have
been
opened
and
it
ordered
my
return
i
was
limited
to
a
week
or
must
risk
suspicion
by
staying
dollmann
was
away
according
to
von
br√ºning
probably
be
back
soon
but
how
soon
beyond
norderney
lay
memmert
how
to
probe
its
secret
the
ardour
it
had
roused
in
me
was
giving
way
to
a
mortifying
sense
of
impotence
the
sight
of
the
with
her
crew
preparing
for
sea
was
a
pointed
comment
on
my
diplomacy
and
most
of
all
on
my
ridiculous
survey
of
the
dykes
when
all
was
said
and
done
we
were
of
von
br√ºning
and
dogged
by
grimm
was
it
likely
they
would
let
us
succeed
the
tide
was
swirling
into
the
harbour
in
whorls
of
chocolate
froth
and
as
it
rose
all
bensersiel
dominated
as
before
by
herr
schenkel
straggled
down
to
the
quay
to
watch
the
movements
of
shipping
during
the
transient
but
momentous
hour
when
the
was
a
seaport
the
captain
was
already
afloat
and
her
sailors
busy
with
sidelights
and
engines
when
it
became
known
that
we
too
were
to
sail
and
under
such
distinguished
escort
the
excitement
intensified
again
our
friend
of
the
customs
was
spreading
out
papers
to
sign
while
a
throng
of
helpful
frisians
headed
by
the
twin
giants
of
the
thronged
our
decks
and
made
us
ready
for
sea
in
their
own
confused
fashion
again
we
were
carried
up
to
the
inn
and
overwhelmed
with
advice
and
warnings
and
farewell
toasts
then
back
again
to
find
the
afloat
and
von
br√ºning
just
arrived
cursing
the
weather
and
the
mud
chaffing
davies
genial
and
as
ever
that
mainsail
you
wo
want
it
he
said
tow
you
right
out
to
spiekeroog
it
your
only
anchorage
for
the
night
in
this
wind
under
the
island
near
the
and
that
would
mean
a
dead
beat
for
you
in
the
dark
the
fact
was
so
true
and
the
offer
so
timely
that
davies
faint
protests
were
swept
aside
in
a
torrent
of
ridicule
now
i
think
of
it
the
commander
ended
make
the
trip
with
you
if
i
may
it
be
pleasanter
and
drier
we
all
three
boarded
the
and
then
the
end
came
our
was
attached
and
at
six
the
little
launch
jumped
into
the
collar
and
amidst
a
demonstration
that
could
not
have
been
more
hearty
if
we
had
been
ambassadors
on
a
visit
to
a
friendly
power
we
sidled
out
through
the
jetties
it
took
us
more
than
an
hour
to
cover
the
five
miles
to
spiekeroog
for
the
was
a
heavy
load
in
the
stiff
head
wind
and
davies
though
he
said
nothing
showed
undisguised
distrust
of
our
tug
capacities
he
at
once
left
the
helm
to
me
and
flung
himself
on
the
gear
not
resting
till
every
rope
was
ready
to
hand
the
mainsail
reefed
the
binnacle
lighted
and
all
ready
for
setting
sail
or
anchoring
at
a
moment
notice
our
guest
watched
these
precautions
with
infinite
amusement
he
was
in
the
highest
and
most
mischievous
humour
raining
banter
on
davies
and
mock
sympathy
on
me
laughing
at
our
huge
compass
heaving
the
lead
himself
startling
us
with
imaginary
soundings
and
doubting
if
his
men
were
sober
i
offered
entertainment
and
warmth
below
but
he
declined
on
the
ground
that
davies
would
be
tempted
to
cut
the
and
make
us
pass
the
night
on
a
safe
sandbank
davies
took
the
raillery
unmoved
his
work
done
he
took
the
tiller
and
sat
bareheaded
intent
on
the
launch
the
course
the
details
and
chances
of
the
present
i
brought
up
cigars
and
we
settled
ourselves
facing
him
our
backs
to
the
wind
and
spray
and
so
we
made
the
rest
of
the
passage
von
br√ºning
cuddled
against
me
and
the
alternately
shouting
a
jest
to
davies
and
talking
to
me
in
a
light
and
charming
vein
with
just
that
shade
of
patronage
that
the
disparity
in
our
ages
warranted
about
my
time
in
germany
places
people
and
books
i
knew
and
about
life
especially
young
men
life
in
england
a
country
he
had
never
visited
but
hoped
to
i
responding
as
well
as
i
could
striving
to
meet
his
mood
acquit
myself
like
a
man
draw
zest
instead
of
humiliation
from
the
irony
of
our
position
but
scarcely
able
to
make
headway
against
a
numbing
sense
of
defeat
and
incapacity
a
queer
thought
was
haunting
me
too
that
such
skill
and
judgement
as
i
possessed
was
slipping
from
me
as
we
left
the
land
and
faced
again
the
rigours
of
this
exacting
sea
davies
i
very
well
knew
was
under
exactly
the
opposite
spell
a
spell
which
even
the
reproach
of
the
could
not
annul
his
face
in
the
glow
of
the
binnacle
was
beginning
to
wear
that
same
look
of
contentment
and
resolve
that
i
had
seen
on
it
that
night
we
had
sailed
to
kiel
from
schlei
fiord
heaven
knows
he
had
more
cause
for
worry
than
i
a
casual
comrade
in
an
adventure
which
was
peculiarly
his
which
meant
everything
on
earth
to
him
but
there
he
was
washing
away
perplexity
in
the
salt
wind
drawing
counsel
and
confidence
from
the
unfailing
source
of
all
his
inspirations
the
sea
happy
does
he
said
the
captain
once
i
grunted
that
he
did
ashamed
to
find
how
irritated
the
remark
made
me
remember
what
i
said
he
added
in
my
ear
i
said
i
should
like
to
see
her
what
she
like
i
could
well
believe
it
the
hull
of
the
loomed
up
and
a
minute
later
our
kedge
was
splashing
overboard
and
the
launch
was
backing
alongside
gentlemen
said
our
passenger
safe
enough
here
and
you
can
run
across
in
ten
minutes
in
the
morning
and
pick
up
your
anchor
if
it
there
still
then
you
a
fair
wind
west
to
england
if
you
like
if
you
decide
to
stay
a
little
longer
in
these
parts
and
i
in
reach
count
on
me
to
help
you
to
sport
or
anything
else
we
thanked
him
shook
hands
and
he
was
gone
a
thundering
good
chap
anyhow
said
davies
and
i
heartily
agreed
the
narrow
vigilant
life
began
again
at
once
we
were
in
a
sense
but
a
warp
and
a
anchor
were
poor
security
if
the
wind
backed
or
increased
plans
for
contingencies
had
to
be
made
and
kept
till
midnight
when
the
weather
seemed
to
improve
and
stars
appeared
the
glass
was
rising
so
we
turned
in
and
slept
under
the
very
wing
so
to
speak
of
the
imperial
government
i
said
when
we
were
settled
in
our
bunks
only
a
day
sail
to
norderney
is
it
a
fair
wind
less
if
we
go
outside
the
islands
direct
it
settled
that
we
do
that
suppose
so
we
got
to
get
the
anchor
first
xix
the
rubicon
it
was
a
cold
vaporous
dawn
the
glass
rising
and
the
wind
fallen
to
a
light
air
still
from
the
our
creased
and
sodden
sails
scarcely
answered
to
it
as
we
crept
across
the
oily
swell
to
langeoog
and
calms
davies
prophesied
the
was
astir
when
we
passed
her
and
soon
after
steamed
out
to
sea
once
over
the
bar
she
turned
westward
and
was
lost
to
view
in
the
haze
i
should
be
sorry
to
have
to
explain
how
we
found
that
tiny
on
the
expressionless
waste
of
grey
i
only
know
that
i
hove
the
lead
incessantly
while
davies
conned
till
at
last
he
was
grabbing
overside
with
the
boathook
and
there
was
the
buoy
on
deck
the
cable
was
soon
following
it
and
finally
the
rusty
monster
himself
more
loathsome
than
usual
after
his
long
sojourn
in
the
slime
all
right
said
davies
we
can
go
anywhere
it
norderney
is
it
we
settled
that
i
suppose
we
have
i
was
wondering
whether
it
would
be
shortest
to
go
inside
langeoog
after
all
not
i
urged
tide
ebbing
now
and
the
light
bad
it
new
ground
with
a
watershed
to
cross
and
we
safe
to
get
aground
right
outside
ready
about
we
swung
lazily
round
and
headed
for
the
open
sea
i
record
the
fact
but
in
truth
davies
might
have
taken
me
where
he
liked
for
no
land
was
visible
only
a
couple
of
ghostly
booms
seems
a
pity
to
miss
over
that
channel
said
davies
with
a
sigh
when
the
ca
watch
us
we
had
not
seen
her
at
all
this
morning
i
set
myself
to
the
lead
again
averse
to
reopening
a
barren
argument
grimm
had
done
his
work
for
the
present
i
felt
certain
and
was
on
his
way
by
the
shortest
road
to
norderney
and
memmert
we
were
soon
outside
and
heading
west
our
boom
squared
away
and
the
island
just
apparent
under
our
lee
then
the
breeze
died
to
the
merest
draught
and
left
us
rolling
inert
in
a
long
swell
consumed
with
impatience
to
get
on
i
saw
fatality
in
this
failure
of
wind
after
a
fortnight
of
unprofitable
meanderings
when
we
had
generally
had
too
much
of
it
and
always
enough
for
our
purpose
i
tried
to
read
below
but
the
vile
squirting
of
the
centreboard
drove
me
up
we
go
any
faster
i
burst
out
once
i
felt
that
there
ought
to
be
a
pyramid
of
gauzy
canvas
aloft
spinnakers
flying
jibs
and
what
not
do
go
in
for
speed
said
davies
shortly
he
loyally
did
his
best
to
her
along
but
puffs
and
calms
were
the
rule
all
day
and
it
was
only
by
towing
in
the
dinghy
for
two
hours
in
the
afternoon
that
we
covered
the
length
of
langeoog
and
crept
before
dark
to
an
anchorage
behind
baltrum
its
neighbour
on
the
west
strictly
i
believe
we
should
have
kept
the
sea
all
night
but
i
had
not
the
grit
to
suggest
that
course
and
davies
was
only
too
glad
of
an
excuse
for
threading
the
shoals
of
the
accumer
ee
on
a
rising
tide
the
atmosphere
had
been
slowly
clearing
as
the
day
wore
on
but
we
had
scarcely
anchored
ten
minutes
before
a
blanket
of
white
fog
rolling
in
from
seaward
swallowed
us
up
davies
was
already
afield
in
the
dinghy
and
i
had
to
guide
him
back
with
a
foghorn
whose
music
roused
hosts
of
sea
birds
from
the
surrounding
flats
and
brought
them
wheeling
and
complaining
round
us
a
weird
invisible
chorus
to
my
mournful
solo
the
fog
hung
heavy
still
at
daybreak
on
the
but
dispersed
partially
under
a
catspaw
from
the
south
about
eight
in
time
for
us
to
traverse
the
boomed
channel
behind
baltrum
before
the
tide
left
the
watershed
sha
get
far
said
davies
with
philosophy
this
sort
of
thing
may
go
on
for
any
time
it
a
regular
autumn
glass
thirty
point
five
and
steady
that
gale
was
the
last
of
a
stormy
equinox
we
took
the
inside
route
as
a
matter
of
course
it
was
now
the
shortest
to
norderney
harbour
and
scarcely
less
intricate
than
the
wichter
ee
which
appeared
to
be
almost
totally
blocked
by
banks
and
is
in
fact
the
most
impassable
of
all
these
outlets
to
the
north
sea
but
as
i
say
this
sort
of
navigation
always
puzzling
to
me
was
utterly
bewildering
in
hazy
weather
any
attempt
at
orientation
made
me
giddy
so
i
slaved
at
the
lead
varying
my
labour
with
a
fierce
bout
of
when
we
grounded
somewhere
i
had
two
rests
before
two
one
of
an
hour
when
we
ran
into
a
patch
of
windless
fog
another
of
a
few
moments
when
davies
said
norderney
and
i
saw
surmounting
a
long
slope
of
weedy
sand
still
wet
with
the
receding
sea
a
cluster
of
sandhills
exactly
like
a
hundred
others
i
had
seen
of
late
but
fraught
with
a
new
and
unique
interest
the
usual
formula
have
you
got
now
checked
my
reverie
and
ended
it
for
the
time
we
tacked
on
for
the
wind
had
headed
us
in
very
shoal
water
suddenly
davies
said
that
a
boat
ahead
you
mean
that
galliot
i
asked
i
could
plainly
distinguish
one
of
those
familiar
craft
about
half
a
mile
away
just
within
the
limit
of
vision
do
you
think
i
added
davies
said
nothing
but
grew
inattentive
to
his
work
four
from
me
passed
unnoticed
and
we
touched
once
but
swung
off
under
some
play
of
the
current
then
came
abruptly
by
the
anchor
let
go
and
we
brought
up
in
of
the
narrow
creek
we
were
following
i
triced
up
the
and
stowed
the
headsails
unaided
when
i
had
done
davies
was
still
gazing
to
windward
through
his
binoculars
and
to
my
astonishment
i
noticed
that
his
hands
were
trembling
violently
i
had
never
seen
this
happen
before
even
at
moments
when
a
false
turn
of
the
wrist
meant
death
on
a
bank
is
it
i
asked
you
cold
little
boat
he
said
i
gazed
to
windward
too
and
now
saw
a
scrap
of
white
in
the
distance
in
sharp
relief
standing
lug
and
jib
it
her
right
enough
said
davies
to
himself
in
a
sort
of
nervous
stammer
what
dinghy
he
handed
or
rather
pushed
me
the
glasses
still
gazing
i
exclaimed
it
the
one
she
always
sails
she
come
to
meet
m
us
through
the
glasses
the
white
scrap
became
a
graceful
little
sail
squared
away
for
the
light
following
breeze
an
angle
of
the
creek
hid
the
hull
then
it
glided
into
view
someone
was
sitting
aft
steering
man
or
woman
i
could
not
say
for
the
sail
hid
most
of
the
figure
for
full
two
minutes
two
long
pregnant
minutes
we
watched
it
in
silence
the
damp
air
was
fogging
the
lenses
but
i
kept
them
to
my
eyes
for
i
did
not
want
to
look
at
davies
at
last
i
heard
him
draw
a
deep
breath
straighten
himself
up
and
give
one
of
his
characteristic
then
he
turned
briskly
aft
cast
off
the
dinghy
painter
and
pulled
her
up
alongside
come
too
he
said
jumping
in
and
fixing
the
rowlocks
his
hands
were
steady
again
i
laughed
and
shoved
the
dinghy
off
rather
you
did
he
said
defiantly
rather
stay
i
tidy
up
and
put
the
kettle
on
davies
had
taken
a
half
stroke
but
paused
ought
to
come
aboard
he
said
might
like
to
i
suggested
day
long
way
from
home
common
courtesy
said
davies
she
comes
aboard
please
remember
that
she
outside
this
business
there
are
no
clues
to
be
got
from
a
little
lecture
which
would
have
nettled
me
more
if
i
had
not
been
exultantly
telling
myself
that
once
and
for
all
for
good
or
ill
the
rubicon
was
passed
your
affair
this
time
i
said
it
as
you
please
he
sculled
away
with
vigorous
strokes
as
he
is
i
thought
to
myself
bare
head
beaded
with
ancient
oilskin
coat
only
one
button
grey
jersey
grey
woollen
trousers
like
a
fisherman
stuffed
into
long
boots
a
vision
of
his
antitype
the
cowes
philanderer
crossed
me
for
a
second
as
to
his
face
well
i
could
only
judge
by
it
and
marvel
that
he
was
gripping
his
dilemma
by
either
horn
as
firmly
as
he
gripped
his
sculls
i
watched
the
two
boats
converging
they
would
meet
in
the
natural
course
about
three
hundred
yards
away
but
a
hitch
occurred
first
the
checked
and
slewed
i
concluded
the
rowboat
leapt
forward
still
then
checked
too
from
both
a
great
splashing
of
sculls
floated
across
the
still
air
then
silence
the
summit
of
the
watershed
a
physical
rubicon
prosaic
and
slimy
had
still
to
be
crossed
it
seemed
but
it
could
be
evaded
both
boats
headed
for
the
northern
side
of
the
creek
two
figures
were
out
on
the
brink
hauling
on
two
painters
then
davies
was
striding
over
the
sand
and
a
girl
i
could
see
her
now
was
coming
to
meet
him
and
then
i
thought
it
was
time
to
go
below
and
tidy
up
nothing
on
earth
could
have
made
the
saloon
a
worthy
for
a
lady
i
could
only
use
hurried
efforts
to
make
it
look
its
best
by
plying
a
bunch
of
and
a
by
pitching
into
racks
and
lockers
the
litter
of
pipes
charts
oddments
of
apparel
and
so
on
that
had
a
way
of
collecting
afresh
however
recently
we
had
tidied
up
by
neatly
arranging
our
demoralized
library
and
by
lighting
the
stove
and
veiling
the
table
under
a
clean
white
cloth
i
suppose
about
twenty
minutes
had
elapsed
and
i
was
scrubbing
fruitlessly
at
the
smoky
patch
on
the
ceiling
when
i
heard
the
sound
of
oars
and
voices
outside
i
threw
the
into
the
made
an
onslaught
on
my
hands
and
then
mounted
the
companion
ladder
our
own
dinghy
was
just
rounding
up
alongside
davies
sculling
in
the
bows
facing
him
in
the
stern
a
young
girl
in
a
grey
loose
waterproof
jacket
and
dark
serge
skirt
the
latter
to
be
frigidly
accurate
disclosing
a
pair
of
rubber
boots
which
mutandis
were
very
like
those
davies
was
wearing
her
hair
like
his
was
spangled
with
moisture
and
her
skin
struck
a
note
of
delicious
colour
against
the
sullen
stygian
background
he
is
said
davies
never
did
his
freund
carruthers
sound
so
pleasantly
in
my
ears
never
so
discordantly
the
dollmann
that
followed
it
every
syllable
of
the
four
was
a
lie
two
honest
english
eyes
were
looking
up
into
mine
an
honest
english
hand
is
this
insular
nonsense
perhaps
so
but
i
stick
to
it
a
brown
firm
hand
no
not
so
very
small
my
sentimental
reader
was
clasping
mine
of
course
i
had
strong
reasons
apart
from
the
racial
instinct
for
thinking
her
to
be
english
but
i
believe
that
if
i
had
had
none
at
all
i
should
at
any
rate
have
congratulated
germany
on
a
clever
bit
of
plagiarism
by
her
voice
when
she
spoke
i
knew
that
she
must
have
talked
german
habitually
from
childhood
diction
and
accent
were
faultless
at
least
to
my
english
ear
but
the
native
constitutional
ring
was
wanting
she
came
on
board
there
was
a
hollow
discussion
first
about
time
and
weather
but
it
ended
as
we
all
in
our
hearts
wished
it
to
end
none
of
us
uttered
our
real
scruples
mine
indeed
were
too
new
and
rudimentary
to
be
worth
uttering
so
i
said
things
about
tea
and
warmth
but
i
began
to
think
about
my
compact
with
davies
for
a
few
minutes
then
she
said
i
held
out
my
hand
and
swung
her
up
she
gazed
round
the
deck
and
rigging
with
profound
interest
a
breathless
hungry
interest
touching
to
see
seen
her
before
have
you
i
said
not
been
on
board
before
she
answered
this
struck
me
in
passing
as
odd
but
then
i
had
only
too
few
details
from
davies
about
his
days
at
norderney
in
september
course
is
what
puzzled
me
she
exclaimed
suddenly
pointing
to
the
mizzen
knew
there
was
something
different
davies
had
belayed
the
painter
and
now
had
to
explain
the
origin
of
the
mizzen
this
was
a
cumbrous
process
and
his
hearer
attention
soon
wandered
from
the
subject
and
became
centred
in
him
his
was
already
more
than
half
in
her
and
the
result
was
a
golden
opportunity
for
the
discerning
onlooker
it
was
very
brief
but
i
made
the
most
of
it
buried
deep
a
few
regrets
did
a
little
heartfelt
penance
told
myself
i
had
been
a
cynical
fool
not
to
have
foreseen
this
and
faced
the
new
situation
with
a
sinking
heart
i
am
not
ashamed
to
admit
that
for
i
was
fond
of
davies
and
i
was
keen
about
the
quest
she
had
never
been
a
guilty
agent
in
that
attempt
on
davies
had
she
been
an
unconscious
tool
or
only
an
unwilling
one
if
the
latter
did
she
know
the
secret
we
were
seeking
in
the
last
degree
unlikely
i
decided
but
true
to
the
compact
whose
importance
i
now
fully
appreciated
i
flung
aside
my
diplomatic
weapons
recoiling
as
strongly
or
nearly
as
strongly
let
us
say
from
any
effort
direct
or
indirect
to
gain
information
from
such
a
source
it
was
not
our
fault
if
by
her
own
conversation
and
behaviour
she
gave
us
some
idea
of
how
matters
stood
davies
already
knew
more
than
i
did
we
spent
a
few
minutes
on
deck
while
she
asked
eager
questions
about
our
build
and
gear
and
seaworthiness
with
a
quaint
mixture
of
professional
acumen
and
personal
curiosity
you
manage
alone
that
day
she
asked
davies
suddenly
it
was
quite
safe
was
the
reply
it
much
better
to
have
a
friend
she
looked
at
me
and
well
i
would
have
died
for
davies
there
and
then
said
you
would
be
safe
she
remarked
with
decision
a
slight
excess
of
decision
i
thought
and
at
that
turned
to
some
rope
or
block
and
pursued
her
questioning
she
found
the
compass
impressive
and
the
trappings
of
that
hateful
centreboard
had
a
peculiar
fascination
for
her
was
this
the
way
we
did
it
in
england
was
her
constant
query
yet
in
spite
of
a
superficial
freedom
we
were
all
shy
and
constrained
the
descent
below
was
a
welcome
diversion
for
we
should
have
been
less
than
human
if
we
had
not
extracted
some
spontaneous
fun
from
the
humours
of
the
saloon
i
went
down
first
to
see
about
the
tea
leaving
them
struggling
for
mutual
comprehension
over
the
theory
of
an
english
lifeboat
they
soon
followed
and
i
can
see
her
now
stooping
in
at
the
doorway
treading
delicately
like
a
kitten
past
the
obstructive
centreboard
to
a
place
on
the
starboard
sofa
then
taking
in
her
surroundings
with
a
timid
rapture
that
broke
into
delight
at
all
the
primitive
arrangements
and
dingy
amenities
of
our
den
she
explored
the
cavernous
recesses
of
the
rippingille
fingered
the
and
the
miscellany
in
the
racks
and
peeped
into
the
with
dainty
awe
everything
was
a
source
of
merriment
from
our
cramped
attitudes
to
the
painful
deficiency
of
spoons
and
the
there
is
no
other
word
to
describe
it
of
the
bread
which
had
been
bought
at
bensersiel
and
had
suffered
from
incarceration
and
the
climate
this
fact
came
out
and
led
to
some
questions
while
we
waited
for
the
water
to
boil
about
the
gale
and
our
visit
there
the
topic
a
pregnant
one
for
us
appeared
to
have
no
special
significance
to
her
at
the
mention
of
von
br√ºning
she
showed
no
emotion
of
any
sort
on
the
contrary
she
went
out
of
her
way
from
an
innocent
motive
that
anyone
could
have
guessed
to
show
that
she
could
talk
about
him
with
dispassionate
detachment
came
to
see
us
when
you
were
here
last
did
he
she
said
to
davies
often
comes
he
goes
with
father
to
memmert
sometimes
you
know
about
memmert
they
are
diving
for
money
out
of
an
old
wreck
we
had
heard
about
it
course
you
have
father
is
a
director
of
the
company
and
commander
von
br√ºning
takes
great
interest
in
it
they
took
me
down
in
a
once
i
murmured
and
davies
sawed
laboriously
at
the
bread
she
must
have
misconstrued
our
sheepish
silence
for
she
stopped
and
drew
herself
up
with
just
a
touch
of
momentary
utterly
lost
on
davies
i
could
have
laughed
aloud
at
this
transient
little
comedy
of
errors
you
see
any
gold
said
davies
at
last
with
husky
solemnity
something
had
to
be
said
or
we
should
defeat
our
own
end
but
i
let
him
say
it
he
had
not
my
faith
in
memmert
only
mud
and
timber
oh
i
forgot
must
betray
the
company
secrets
i
said
laughing
von
br√ºning
would
tell
us
a
word
about
the
gold
i
said
to
myself
i
do
think
it
matters
much
she
answered
laughing
too
are
only
visitors
all
i
remarked
demurely
passing
travellers
will
stop
at
norderney
she
said
with
na√Øve
anxiety
davies
said
i
looked
to
davies
it
was
his
affair
fair
and
square
came
his
answer
in
blunt
of
course
we
shall
i
should
like
to
see
your
father
again
up
to
this
moment
i
had
been
doubtful
of
his
final
decision
for
ever
since
our
explanation
at
bensersiel
i
had
had
the
feeling
that
i
was
holding
his
nose
to
a
very
cruel
grindstone
this
straight
word
clear
and
direct
beyond
anything
i
had
hoped
for
brought
me
to
my
senses
and
showed
me
that
his
mind
had
been
working
far
in
advance
of
mine
and
more
shaping
a
double
purpose
that
i
had
never
dreamt
of
father
said
fr√§ulein
dollmann
i
am
sure
he
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
there
was
no
conviction
in
her
tone
and
her
eyes
were
distant
and
troubled
not
at
home
now
is
he
i
asked
did
you
know
a
little
maidenly
confusion
commander
von
br√ºning
i
might
have
added
that
it
had
been
clear
as
daylight
all
along
that
this
visit
was
in
the
nature
of
an
escapade
of
which
her
father
might
not
approve
i
tried
to
say
wo
tell
without
words
and
may
have
succeeded
told
mr
davies
when
we
first
met
she
went
on
expect
him
back
very
soon
in
fact
he
wrote
from
amsterdam
he
left
me
at
hamburg
and
has
been
away
since
of
course
he
will
not
know
your
yacht
is
back
again
i
think
he
expected
mr
davies
would
stay
in
the
baltic
as
the
season
was
so
late
but
but
i
am
sure
he
will
be
glad
to
see
you
the
in
harbour
said
davies
but
we
are
not
living
on
her
now
we
are
at
our
villa
in
the
schwannall√©e
my
stepmother
and
i
that
is
she
added
some
details
and
davies
gravely
pencilled
down
the
address
on
a
leaf
of
the
a
formality
which
somehow
seemed
to
regularize
the
present
position
shall
be
at
norderney
he
said
meanwhile
the
kettle
was
boiling
merrily
and
i
made
the
tea
cocoa
i
should
say
for
the
menu
was
changed
in
deference
to
our
tastes
fun
she
said
and
by
common
consent
we
abandoned
ourselves
three
youthful
hungry
mariners
to
the
enjoyment
of
this
impromptu
picnic
such
a
chance
might
never
occur
again
but
the
banquet
was
never
celebrated
as
at
belshazzar
feast
there
was
a
writing
on
the
wall
no
supernatural
inscription
but
just
a
printed
name
an
english
surname
with
title
and
initials
in
cheap
gilt
lettering
on
the
back
of
an
old
book
a
silent
sneering
witness
of
our
snug
party
the
catastrophe
came
and
passed
so
suddenly
that
at
the
time
i
had
scarcely
even
an
inkling
of
what
caused
it
but
i
know
now
that
this
is
how
it
happened
our
visitor
was
sitting
at
the
forward
end
of
the
starboard
sofa
close
to
the
bulkhead
davies
and
i
were
opposite
her
across
the
bulkhead
on
a
level
with
our
heads
ran
the
bookshelf
whose
contents
remember
i
had
carefully
straightened
only
half
an
hour
ago
little
dreaming
of
the
consequence
some
trifle
probably
the
logbook
which
davies
had
reached
down
from
the
shelf
called
her
attention
to
the
rest
of
our
library
while
busied
with
the
cocoa
i
heard
her
spelling
out
some
titles
fingering
leaves
and
twitting
davies
with
the
little
care
he
took
of
his
books
suddenly
there
was
a
silence
which
made
me
look
up
to
see
a
startled
and
pitiful
change
in
her
she
was
staring
at
davies
with
wide
eyes
and
parted
lips
a
burning
flush
mounting
on
her
forehead
and
such
an
expression
on
her
face
as
a
might
wear
who
wakes
in
fear
he
knows
not
where
half
her
mind
was
far
away
labouring
to
construe
some
hideous
dream
of
the
past
half
was
in
the
present
cringing
before
some
sickening
reality
she
remained
so
for
perhaps
ten
seconds
and
then
plucky
girl
that
she
was
she
mastered
herself
looked
deliberately
round
and
up
with
a
circular
glance
strangely
in
the
manner
of
davies
himself
and
spoke
how
late
it
was
she
must
be
going
her
boat
was
not
safe
at
the
same
time
she
rose
to
go
or
rather
slid
herself
along
the
sofa
for
rising
was
impossible
we
sat
like
mannerless
louts
in
blank
amazement
davies
at
the
outset
had
said
the
matter
in
plain
english
and
then
relapsed
into
stupefaction
i
recovered
myself
the
first
and
protested
in
some
awkward
fashion
about
the
cocoa
the
time
the
absence
of
fog
in
trying
to
answer
her
broke
down
poor
child
and
her
retreat
became
a
blind
flight
like
that
of
a
wounded
animal
while
every
sordid
circumstance
seemed
to
accentuate
her
panic
she
tilted
the
corner
of
the
table
in
leaving
the
sofa
and
spilt
cocoa
over
her
skirt
she
knocked
her
head
with
painful
force
against
the
sharp
lintel
of
the
doorway
and
stumbled
on
the
steps
of
the
ladder
i
was
close
behind
but
when
i
reached
the
deck
she
was
already
on
the
counter
hauling
up
the
dinghy
she
had
even
jumped
in
and
laid
hands
on
the
sculls
before
any
check
came
in
her
precipitate
movements
now
there
occurred
to
her
the
patent
fact
that
the
dinghy
was
ours
and
that
someone
must
accompany
her
to
bring
it
back
will
row
you
over
i
said
no
thank
you
she
stammered
you
will
be
so
kind
herr
carruthers
it
is
your
turn
no
i
mean
i
want
on
said
davies
to
me
in
english
i
stepped
into
the
dinghy
and
motioned
to
take
the
sculls
from
her
she
seemed
not
to
see
me
and
pushed
off
while
davies
handed
down
her
jacket
which
she
had
left
in
the
cabin
neither
of
us
tried
to
better
the
situation
by
conventional
apologies
it
was
left
to
her
at
the
last
moment
to
make
a
show
of
excusing
herself
an
attempt
so
brave
and
yet
so
wretchedly
lame
that
i
tingled
all
over
with
hot
shame
she
only
made
matters
worse
and
davies
interrupted
her
he
said
simply
she
shook
her
head
did
not
even
offer
her
hand
and
pulled
away
davies
turned
sharp
round
and
went
below
there
was
now
no
muddy
rubicon
to
obstruct
us
for
the
tide
had
risen
a
good
deal
and
the
sands
were
covering
i
offered
again
to
take
the
sculls
but
she
took
no
notice
and
rowed
on
so
that
i
was
a
silent
passenger
on
the
stem
seat
till
we
reached
her
boat
a
spruce
little
yacht
gig
built
to
the
native
model
with
a
and
tiny
it
was
already
afloat
but
riding
quite
safely
to
a
rope
and
a
little
grapnel
which
she
proceeded
to
haul
in
was
quite
safe
after
all
you
see
i
said
but
i
could
not
stay
herr
carruthers
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
i
knew
it
was
coming
von
br√ºning
warning
over
again
made
a
mistake
just
now
it
is
no
use
your
calling
on
us
not
will
not
see
my
father
thought
you
said
he
was
coming
back
by
the
morning
steamer
but
he
will
be
very
busy
can
wait
we
have
several
days
to
spare
and
we
have
to
call
for
letters
anyhow
must
not
delay
on
our
account
the
weather
is
very
fine
at
last
it
would
be
a
pity
to
lose
a
chance
of
a
smooth
voyage
to
england
the
season
have
no
fixed
plans
davies
wants
to
get
some
shooting
father
will
be
much
occupied
can
see
i
insisted
on
being
obtuse
for
though
this
fencing
with
an
unstrung
girl
was
hateful
work
the
quest
was
at
stake
we
were
going
to
norderney
come
what
might
and
sooner
or
later
we
must
see
dollmann
it
was
no
use
promising
not
to
i
had
given
no
pledge
to
von
br√ºning
and
i
would
give
none
to
her
the
only
alternative
was
to
violate
the
compact
which
the
present
fiasco
had
surely
weakened
speak
out
and
try
and
make
an
ally
of
her
against
her
own
father
i
shrank
from
the
responsibility
and
counted
the
cost
of
failure
certain
failure
to
judge
by
her
conduct
she
began
to
hoist
her
lugsail
in
a
dazed
shiftless
fashion
while
our
two
boats
drifted
slowly
to
leeward
might
not
like
it
she
said
so
low
and
from
such
tremulous
lips
that
i
scarcely
caught
her
words
does
not
like
foreigners
much
i
am
afraid
he
did
not
want
to
see
herr
davies
again
i
thought
was
wrong
of
me
to
come
aboard
i
suddenly
remembered
but
i
could
not
tell
herr
davies
see
i
answered
will
tell
him
that
he
must
not
come
near
us
will
understand
i
know
he
will
be
very
sorry
but
i
added
firmly
can
trust
him
implicitly
to
do
the
right
thing
and
how
i
prayed
that
this
would
content
her
thank
heaven
it
did
she
said
am
afraid
i
did
not
say
to
him
you
will
do
so
she
gave
me
her
hand
thing
more
i
added
holding
it
had
better
be
said
about
this
meeting
no
nothing
it
must
never
be
known
i
let
go
the
gig
gunwale
and
watched
her
tighten
her
sheet
and
make
a
tack
or
two
to
windward
then
i
rowed
back
to
the
as
hard
as
i
could
xx
the
little
drab
book
i
found
davies
at
the
cabin
table
surrounded
with
a
litter
of
books
the
shelf
was
empty
and
its
contents
were
tossed
about
among
the
cups
and
on
the
floor
we
both
spoke
together
what
was
it
what
did
she
say
i
gave
way
and
told
my
story
briefly
he
listened
in
silence
drumming
on
the
table
with
a
book
which
he
held
not
he
said
i
do
wonder
look
here
and
he
held
out
to
me
a
small
volume
whose
appearance
was
quite
familiar
to
me
if
its
contents
were
less
so
as
i
noted
in
an
early
chapter
davies
library
excluding
was
limited
to
two
classes
of
books
those
on
naval
warfare
and
those
on
his
own
hobby
cruising
in
small
yachts
he
had
six
or
seven
of
the
latter
including
knight
in
the
baltic
cowper
tours
macmullen
and
other
less
known
stories
of
adventurous
travel
i
had
scarcely
done
more
than
look
into
some
of
them
at
for
our
life
had
left
no
leisure
for
reading
this
particular
volume
was
no
i
had
better
not
describe
it
too
fully
but
i
will
say
that
it
was
old
and
unpretentious
bound
in
cheap
cloth
of
a
rather
antiquated
style
with
a
title
which
showed
it
to
be
a
guide
for
yachtsmen
to
a
certain
british
estuary
a
white
label
partly
scratched
away
bore
the
legend
i
had
glanced
at
it
once
or
twice
with
no
special
interest
i
said
turning
over
some
yellow
pages
cried
davies
wrote
it
i
turned
to
the
and
read
lieut
x
the
name
itself
conveyed
nothing
to
me
but
i
began
to
understand
davies
went
on
on
the
back
too
and
i
certain
it
the
last
she
looked
at
how
do
you
know
there
the
man
himself
ass
that
i
am
not
to
have
seen
it
before
look
at
the
frontispiece
it
was
a
sorry
piece
of
illustration
of
the
sort
lacking
definition
and
finish
but
effective
notwithstanding
for
it
was
evidently
the
reproduction
though
a
cheap
and
imperfect
process
of
a
photograph
it
represented
a
small
yacht
at
anchor
below
some
woods
with
the
owner
standing
on
deck
in
his
shirt
sleeves
a
powerful
man
young
of
middle
height
clean
shaved
there
appeared
to
be
nothing
remarkable
about
the
face
the
portrait
being
on
too
small
a
scale
and
the
expression
such
as
it
was
being
of
the
fixed
character
do
you
know
him
you
said
he
was
fifty
with
a
greyish
beard
the
shape
of
his
head
that
has
changed
look
how
it
widens
at
the
top
and
then
flattens
sort
of
wedge
shaped
with
a
high
steep
forehead
you
hardly
notice
it
in
that
the
points
were
not
very
noticeable
but
i
saw
what
davies
meant
height
and
figure
are
right
too
and
the
dates
are
about
right
look
at
the
bottom
underneath
the
picture
was
the
name
of
a
yacht
and
a
date
the
publisher
date
on
the
was
the
same
years
ago
said
davies
looks
thirty
odd
in
that
does
he
and
fifty
now
work
the
thing
out
sixteen
years
ago
he
was
still
an
englishman
an
officer
in
her
majesty
navy
now
he
a
german
at
some
time
between
this
and
then
i
suppose
he
came
to
grief
disgrace
flight
exile
when
did
it
happen
been
here
three
years
von
br√ºning
said
so
was
long
before
that
she
has
talked
german
from
a
child
her
age
do
you
think
nineteen
or
twenty
that
she
was
four
when
this
book
was
published
the
crash
must
have
come
not
long
after
they
been
hiding
in
germany
since
this
a
book
never
saw
another
copy
picked
this
up
on
a
bookstall
for
threepence
looked
at
it
you
say
i
certain
of
it
she
never
on
board
you
in
september
i
asked
them
both
but
dollmann
made
excuses
came
on
board
you
told
me
so
he
asked
himself
to
breakfast
on
the
first
day
by
jove
yes
you
mean
he
saw
the
book
explains
a
good
deal
explains
everything
we
fell
into
deep
reflexion
for
a
minute
or
two
you
really
mean
i
said
that
case
let
sail
straight
away
and
forget
the
whole
affair
he
only
some
poor
devil
with
a
past
whose
secret
you
stumbled
on
and
half
mad
with
fear
he
tried
to
silence
you
but
you
do
want
revenge
so
it
no
business
of
ours
we
can
ruin
him
if
we
like
but
is
it
worth
it
do
mean
a
word
you
saying
said
davies
i
know
why
you
say
it
and
many
thanks
old
chap
i
did
mean
everything
he
plotting
with
germans
or
why
did
grimm
spy
on
us
and
von
br√ºning
us
we
got
to
find
out
what
he
at
as
well
as
who
he
is
and
as
to
her
what
do
you
think
of
her
now
i
made
my
heartily
and
ignorant
was
my
verdict
that
is
of
her
father
treasonable
machinations
but
aware
clearly
that
they
were
english
refugees
with
a
past
to
hide
i
said
other
things
but
they
do
not
matter
i
concluded
makes
the
dilemma
infinitely
worse
no
dilemma
at
all
said
davies
said
at
bensersiel
that
we
could
hurt
him
without
hurting
her
well
all
i
can
say
is
we
to
the
time
to
cut
and
run
if
ever
was
when
we
sighted
her
dinghy
i
had
a
baddish
minute
then
given
us
a
clue
or
two
after
all
was
our
fault
to
refuse
to
have
her
on
board
would
have
been
to
give
our
show
away
and
the
very
fact
that
she
given
us
clues
decides
the
matter
she
must
suffer
for
it
will
she
do
to
her
father
i
suppose
what
shall
we
do
do
know
yet
how
can
i
know
it
depends
said
davies
slowly
the
point
is
that
we
have
two
objects
equally
important
yes
equally
by
jove
to
scotch
him
and
save
her
there
was
a
pause
rather
a
large
order
i
observed
you
realize
that
at
this
very
moment
we
have
probably
gained
the
first
object
if
we
went
home
now
walked
into
the
admiralty
and
laid
our
facts
before
them
what
would
be
the
result
admiralty
said
davies
with
ineffable
scorn
scotland
yard
too
then
both
of
them
want
our
man
i
dare
say
it
would
be
strange
if
between
them
they
could
dislodge
him
and
incidentally
either
discover
what
going
on
here
or
draw
such
attention
to
this
bit
of
coast
as
to
make
further
secrecy
impossible
out
of
the
question
to
let
her
betray
her
father
and
then
run
away
besides
we
do
know
enough
and
they
might
believe
us
it
a
cowardly
course
however
you
look
at
it
that
settles
it
i
answered
hastily
i
want
to
go
back
over
the
facts
when
did
you
first
see
her
first
morning
was
in
the
saloon
the
night
before
and
he
did
mention
her
would
have
gone
away
next
morning
if
he
had
called
i
told
you
so
allowed
her
to
persuade
you
to
make
that
voyage
with
them
suppose
so
he
sent
her
below
when
the
pilotage
was
going
on
course
said
just
now
father
said
you
would
be
safe
what
had
you
been
saying
to
her
was
when
i
met
her
on
the
sand
by
the
way
it
was
a
chance
meeting
she
had
been
making
inquiries
and
heard
about
us
from
a
skipper
who
had
seen
the
yacht
near
wangeroog
and
she
had
been
down
this
way
before
she
asked
at
once
about
that
day
and
began
apologizing
rather
awkwardly
you
know
for
their
rudeness
in
not
having
waited
for
me
at
cuxhaven
her
father
found
he
must
get
on
to
hamburg
at
once
you
did
go
to
cuxhaven
you
told
her
that
what
exactly
you
tell
her
this
is
important
was
in
a
fearful
fix
not
knowing
what
had
told
her
so
i
said
something
vague
and
then
she
asked
the
very
question
von
br√ºning
did
was
there
a
sea
round
the
scharhorn
did
know
you
took
the
short
cut
then
he
had
dared
to
tell
her
knew
that
took
it
he
could
possibly
have
hidden
that
she
would
have
known
by
the
look
of
the
sea
from
the
portholes
the
shorter
time
etc
when
the
hove
to
and
he
shouted
to
you
to
follow
him
did
she
understand
what
was
happening
evidently
not
mind
you
she
could
possibly
have
heard
what
we
said
in
that
weather
from
below
i
could
her
but
it
was
clear
enough
what
she
thought
namely
that
he
had
hove
to
for
exactly
the
opposite
reason
to
say
was
taking
the
short
cut
and
that
i
was
to
attempt
to
follow
him
why
she
laid
stress
on
for
you
at
cuxhaven
course
mine
would
have
been
the
longer
passage
had
no
notion
of
foul
play
that
i
could
see
after
all
there
i
was
alive
and
well
she
was
remorseful
for
having
induced
you
to
sail
at
all
that
day
and
for
not
having
waited
to
see
you
arrived
safely
about
it
what
did
you
say
about
cuxhaven
i
let
her
understand
that
i
went
there
and
not
finding
them
went
on
to
the
baltic
by
the
eider
river
having
changed
my
mind
about
the
ship
canal
what
about
her
voyage
back
from
hamburg
was
she
alone
the
stepmother
joined
her
she
say
she
had
inquired
about
you
at
brunsb√ºttel
i
suppose
she
did
like
to
and
there
was
no
need
because
my
taking
the
eider
explained
it
i
reflected
sure
she
had
a
notion
that
you
took
the
short
cut
sure
but
she
may
guess
it
now
she
guessed
foul
play
by
seeing
that
book
course
she
did
but
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
there
are
two
stories
afloat
now
yours
to
von
br√ºning
the
true
one
that
you
followed
the
to
the
short
cut
and
dollmann
to
her
that
you
went
round
the
scharhorn
that
evidently
his
version
of
the
affair
the
version
he
would
have
given
if
you
had
been
drowned
and
inquiries
were
ever
made
the
version
he
would
have
sworn
his
crew
to
if
they
discovered
the
truth
he
must
drop
that
yarn
when
he
knows
i
alive
and
back
again
but
meanwhile
supposing
von
br√ºning
sees
him
he
knows
you
back
again
and
wants
to
find
out
the
truth
about
that
incident
if
i
were
von
br√ºning
i
should
say
by
the
way
become
of
that
young
englishman
you
decoyed
away
to
the
baltic
dollmann
would
give
his
version
and
von
br√ºning
having
heard
ours
would
know
he
was
lying
and
had
tried
to
drown
you
it
matter
he
must
know
already
that
dollmann
a
scoundrel
we
been
supposing
but
we
may
be
wrong
we
still
in
the
dark
as
to
dollmann
position
towards
these
germans
they
may
not
even
know
he
english
or
they
may
know
that
and
not
know
his
real
name
and
past
what
effect
your
story
will
have
on
their
relations
with
him
we
ca
forecast
but
i
clear
about
one
thing
that
our
paramount
interest
to
maintain
the
as
long
as
we
can
to
minimize
the
danger
you
ran
that
day
and
act
as
witnesses
in
his
defence
we
ca
do
that
if
his
story
and
yours
do
tally
the
discrepancy
will
not
only
damn
him
that
may
be
immaterial
but
it
will
throw
doubt
on
us
if
the
short
cut
was
so
dangerous
that
he
dared
not
own
to
having
led
you
to
it
it
was
dangerous
enough
to
make
you
suspect
foul
play
the
very
supposition
we
want
to
avoid
we
want
to
be
thought
mere
travellers
with
no
scores
to
wipe
out
and
no
secrets
to
pry
after
what
do
you
propose
i
believe
we
stand
fairly
well
let
assume
we
hoodwinked
von
br√ºning
at
bensersiel
and
base
our
policy
on
that
assumption
it
follows
that
we
must
show
dollmann
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
that
you
come
back
and
give
him
time
to
revise
his
tactics
before
he
commits
himself
now
tell
him
we
back
interrupted
davies
do
think
so
we
just
agreed
to
keep
this
afternoon
episode
a
secret
she
expects
never
to
see
us
again
he
comes
by
the
morning
boat
she
said
what
did
that
mean
boat
from
where
know
from
norddeich
on
the
mainland
opposite
there
a
railway
there
from
norden
and
a
steam
ferry
crosses
to
the
island
what
time
bradshaw
will
tell
us
here
it
is
winter
service
due
at
get
away
at
once
we
had
a
tussle
with
the
tide
at
first
but
once
over
the
watershed
the
channel
improved
and
the
haze
lightened
gradually
a
lighthouse
appeared
among
the
on
the
island
shore
and
before
darkness
fell
we
dimly
saw
the
spires
and
roofs
of
a
town
and
two
long
black
piers
stretching
out
southwards
we
were
scarcely
a
mile
away
when
we
lost
our
wind
altogether
and
had
to
anchor
determined
to
reach
our
destination
that
night
we
waited
till
the
ebb
stream
made
and
then
towed
the
yacht
with
the
dinghy
in
the
course
of
this
a
fog
dropped
on
us
suddenly
just
as
it
had
yesterday
i
was
towing
at
the
time
and
of
course
stopped
short
but
davies
shouted
to
me
from
the
tiller
to
go
on
that
he
could
manage
with
the
lead
and
compass
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
at
about
nine
we
anchored
safely
in
the
roadstead
close
to
the
eastern
pier
as
a
short
reconnaissance
proved
to
us
it
had
been
a
little
masterpiece
of
adroit
seamanship
there
was
utter
stillness
till
our
chain
rattled
down
when
a
muffled
shout
came
from
the
direction
of
the
pier
and
soon
we
heard
a
boat
groping
out
to
us
it
was
a
polite
but
sleepy
who
asked
in
a
perfunctory
way
for
our
particulars
and
when
he
heard
them
remembered
the
previous
visit
are
you
bound
to
he
asked
sooner
or
later
said
davies
the
man
laughed
derisively
this
year
he
said
will
be
fogs
for
another
week
it
is
always
so
and
then
storms
better
leave
your
yawl
here
dues
will
be
only
sixpence
a
month
for
you
think
about
it
said
davies
the
man
vanished
like
a
ghost
in
the
thick
night
the
open
i
called
after
him
eight
came
back
out
of
the
fog
we
were
too
excited
to
sup
in
comfort
or
sleep
in
peace
or
to
do
anything
but
plan
and
speculate
never
till
this
night
had
we
talked
with
absolute
mutual
confidence
for
davies
broke
down
the
last
barriers
of
reserve
and
let
me
see
his
whole
mind
he
loved
this
girl
and
he
loved
his
country
two
simple
passions
which
for
the
time
absorbed
his
whole
moral
capacity
there
was
no
room
left
for
casuistry
to
weigh
one
passion
against
the
other
with
the
discordant
voices
of
honour
and
expediency
dinning
in
his
ears
had
too
long
involved
him
in
fruitless
torture
both
were
right
neither
could
be
surrendered
if
the
facts
showed
them
irreconcilable
pis
pour
les
a
way
must
be
found
to
satisfy
both
or
neither
i
should
have
been
a
spiritless
dog
if
i
had
not
risen
to
his
mood
but
in
truth
his
cutting
of
the
knot
was
at
this
juncture
exactly
what
appealed
to
me
i
too
was
tired
of
vicarious
casuistry
and
the
fascination
of
our
enterprise
intensified
by
the
discovery
of
that
afternoon
had
never
been
so
strong
in
me
not
to
be
insincere
i
can
not
pretend
that
i
viewed
the
situation
with
his
single
mind
my
philosophy
when
i
left
london
was
of
a
very
worldly
sort
and
no
one
can
change
his
temperament
in
three
weeks
i
plainly
said
as
much
to
davies
and
indeed
took
perverse
satisfaction
in
stating
with
brutal
emphasis
some
social
truths
which
bore
on
this
attachment
of
his
to
the
daughter
of
an
outlaw
truths
i
call
them
but
i
uttered
them
more
by
rote
than
by
conviction
and
he
heard
them
unmoved
and
meanwhile
i
snatched
recklessly
at
his
own
solution
if
it
imparted
into
our
adventure
a
strain
of
crazy
chivalry
more
suited
to
of
the
middle
ages
than
to
sober
modern
youths
well
thank
heaven
i
was
not
too
sober
and
still
young
enough
to
snatch
at
that
fancy
with
an
ardour
of
imagination
if
not
of
character
perhaps
too
of
character
for
galahads
are
not
so
common
but
that
ordinary
folk
must
needs
draw
courage
from
their
example
and
put
something
of
a
blind
trust
in
their
tenfold
strength
to
reduce
a
romantic
ideal
to
a
working
plan
is
a
very
difficult
thing
shall
have
to
argue
backwards
i
said
is
to
be
the
final
stage
because
that
must
govern
the
others
there
was
only
one
answer
to
get
dollmann
secrets
and
all
daughter
and
all
away
from
germany
altogether
so
only
could
we
satisfy
the
double
aim
we
had
set
before
us
what
a
joy
it
is
when
beset
with
doubts
to
find
a
necessity
however
unattainable
we
fastened
on
this
one
and
reasoned
back
from
it
the
first
lesson
was
that
however
many
and
strong
were
the
enemies
we
had
to
contend
with
our
sole
overt
foe
must
be
dollmann
the
issue
of
the
struggle
must
be
known
only
to
ourselves
and
him
if
we
won
and
found
out
he
was
at
we
must
at
all
costs
conceal
our
success
from
his
german
friends
and
detach
him
from
them
before
he
was
compromised
you
will
remark
that
to
blithely
accept
this
limitation
showed
a
very
sanguine
spirit
in
us
the
next
question
how
to
find
out
what
he
was
at
was
a
deal
more
thorny
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
discovery
of
dollmann
identity
we
should
have
found
it
as
hard
a
nut
to
crack
as
ever
but
this
discovery
was
illuminating
it
threw
into
relief
two
methods
of
action
which
hitherto
we
had
been
hazily
seeking
to
combine
seesawing
between
one
and
the
other
each
of
us
influenced
at
different
times
by
different
motives
one
was
to
rely
on
independent
research
the
other
to
extort
the
secret
from
dollmann
direct
by
craft
or
threats
the
moral
of
was
to
abandon
the
first
and
embrace
the
second
the
prospects
of
independent
research
were
not
a
whit
better
than
before
there
were
only
two
theories
in
the
field
the
channel
theory
and
the
memmert
theory
the
former
languished
for
lack
of
corroboration
the
latter
also
appeared
to
be
weakened
to
fr√§ulein
dollmann
the
were
evidently
what
they
purported
to
be
and
nothing
more
this
fact
in
itself
was
unimportant
for
it
was
clear
as
crystal
that
she
was
no
party
to
her
father
treacherous
intrigues
if
he
was
engaged
in
such
but
if
memmert
was
his
sphere
for
them
it
was
disconcerting
to
find
her
so
familiar
with
that
sphere
lightly
talking
of
a
descent
in
a
hinting
too
that
the
mystery
as
to
results
was
only
for
local
consumption
nevertheless
the
charm
of
memmert
as
the
place
we
had
traced
grimm
to
and
as
the
only
tangible
clue
we
had
obtained
was
still
very
great
the
really
cogent
objection
was
the
insuperable
difficulty
known
and
watched
as
we
were
of
learning
its
significance
if
there
was
anything
important
to
see
there
we
should
never
be
allowed
to
see
it
while
by
trying
and
failing
we
risked
everything
it
was
on
this
point
that
the
last
of
all
misunderstandings
between
me
and
davies
was
dissipated
at
bensersiel
he
had
been
influenced
more
than
he
owned
by
my
arguments
about
memmert
but
at
that
time
as
i
hinted
he
was
biased
by
a
radical
prejudice
the
channel
theory
had
become
a
sort
of
religion
with
him
promising
double
salvation
not
only
avoidance
of
the
dollmanns
but
success
in
the
quest
by
methods
in
which
he
was
past
master
to
have
to
desert
it
and
resort
to
spying
on
naval
defences
was
an
idea
he
dreaded
and
distrusted
it
was
not
the
morality
of
the
course
that
bothered
him
he
was
far
too
to
blink
at
the
essential
fact
that
at
heart
we
were
spies
on
a
foreign
power
in
time
of
peace
or
to
salve
his
conscience
by
specious
distinctions
as
to
our
mode
of
operation
the
foreign
power
to
him
was
dollmann
a
traitor
there
was
his
final
justification
fearlessly
adopted
and
held
to
the
last
it
was
rather
that
knowing
his
own
limitations
his
whole
nature
shrank
from
the
sort
of
action
entailed
by
the
memmert
theory
and
there
was
strong
common
sense
in
his
antipathy
so
much
for
independent
research
on
the
other
hand
the
road
was
now
clear
for
the
other
method
davies
no
longer
feared
to
face
the
imbroglio
at
norderney
and
that
day
fortune
had
given
us
a
new
and
potent
weapon
against
dollmann
precisely
how
potent
we
could
not
tell
for
we
had
only
a
glimpse
of
his
past
and
his
exact
relations
with
the
government
were
unknown
to
us
but
we
knew
who
he
was
using
this
knowledge
with
address
could
we
not
wring
the
rest
from
him
feel
our
way
of
course
be
guided
by
his
own
conduct
but
in
the
end
strike
hard
and
stake
everything
on
the
stroke
such
at
any
rate
was
our
scheme
later
tossing
in
my
bunk
i
bethought
me
of
the
little
drab
book
lit
a
candle
and
fetched
it
a
preface
explained
that
it
had
been
written
during
a
spell
of
two
months
leave
from
naval
duty
and
expressed
a
hope
that
it
might
be
of
service
to
corinthian
sailors
the
style
was
unadorned
but
scholarly
and
pithy
there
was
no
trace
of
the
writer
individuality
save
a
certain
subdued
relish
in
describing
banks
and
shoals
which
reminded
me
of
davies
himself
for
the
rest
i
found
the
book
dull
and
in
fact
it
sent
me
to
sleep
xxi
blindfold
to
memmert
she
comes
said
davies
it
was
nine
on
the
next
day
october
and
we
were
on
deck
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
steamer
from
norddeich
there
was
no
change
in
the
weather
still
the
same
stringent
cold
with
a
high
barometer
and
only
fickle
flaws
of
air
but
the
morning
was
gloriously
clear
except
for
a
wreath
or
two
of
mist
curling
like
smoke
from
the
sea
and
an
attenuated
belt
of
opaque
fog
on
the
northern
horizon
the
harbour
lay
open
before
us
and
very
commodious
and
civilized
it
looked
enclosed
between
two
long
piers
which
ran
quite
half
a
mile
out
from
the
land
to
the
roadstead
riff
gat
by
name
where
we
lay
a
stranger
might
have
taken
it
for
a
deep
and
spacious
haven
but
this
of
course
was
an
illusion
due
to
the
high
water
davies
knew
that
of
it
was
mud
the
remainder
being
a
channel
along
the
western
pier
a
couple
of
tugs
a
dredger
and
a
ferry
packet
with
steam
up
were
moored
on
that
side
a
small
stack
of
galliots
on
the
other
beyond
these
was
another
vessel
a
galliot
in
build
but
radiant
as
a
queen
among
sluts
her
varnished
sides
and
spars
flashing
orange
in
the
sun
these
and
her
sailcovers
and
the
twinkle
of
brass
and
proclaimed
her
to
be
a
yacht
i
had
already
studied
her
through
the
glasses
and
read
on
her
stern
a
couple
of
sailors
were
swabbing
her
decks
you
could
hear
the
slush
of
the
water
and
the
scratching
of
the
can
see
us
anyway
davies
had
said
for
that
matter
all
the
world
could
see
us
certainly
the
incoming
steamer
must
for
we
lay
as
near
to
the
pier
as
safety
permitted
abreast
of
the
berth
she
would
occupy
as
we
knew
by
a
gangway
and
a
knot
of
sailors
a
packet
boat
not
bigger
than
a
big
tug
was
approaching
from
the
south
we
not
supposed
to
know
he
coming
i
said
go
below
besides
the
skylight
our
cabin
top
had
little
oblong
side
windows
we
wiped
clean
those
on
the
port
side
and
watched
events
from
them
kneeling
on
the
sofa
the
steamer
backed
her
paddles
flinging
out
a
wash
that
set
us
rolling
to
our
scuppers
there
seemed
to
be
very
few
passengers
aboard
but
all
of
them
were
gazing
at
the
while
the
packet
was
warped
alongside
on
the
forward
deck
there
were
some
with
baskets
a
postman
and
a
weedy
youth
who
might
be
an
on
the
standing
close
together
were
two
men
in
ulsters
and
soft
felt
hats
he
is
said
davies
in
a
tense
whisper
tall
one
but
the
tall
one
turned
abruptly
as
davies
spoke
and
strode
away
behind
the
leaving
me
just
a
lightning
impression
of
a
grey
beard
and
a
steep
tanned
forehead
behind
a
cloud
of
it
was
perverse
of
me
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
hardly
missed
him
so
occupied
was
i
by
the
short
one
who
remained
leaning
on
the
rail
thoughtfully
contemplating
the
through
a
sallow
wizened
old
fellow
beetlebrowed
with
a
bush
of
grizzled
moustache
and
a
tuft
of
beard
on
his
chin
the
most
remarkable
feature
was
the
nose
which
was
broad
and
flat
merging
almost
imperceptibly
in
the
wrinkled
cheeks
lightly
beaked
at
the
nether
extremity
it
drooped
towards
an
enormous
cigar
which
was
pointing
at
us
like
a
gun
just
discharged
he
looked
wise
as
satan
and
you
would
say
he
was
smiling
inwardly
that
i
whispered
to
davies
there
was
no
need
to
talk
in
whispers
but
we
did
so
instinctively
think
said
davies
she
backing
off
and
not
landed
some
parcels
and
had
been
thrown
up
and
the
weedy
waiter
and
two
had
gone
up
the
gangway
which
was
now
being
hauled
up
and
were
standing
on
the
quay
i
think
one
or
two
other
persons
had
first
come
aboard
unnoticed
by
us
but
at
the
last
moment
a
man
we
had
not
seen
before
jumped
down
to
the
forward
deck
we
both
ejaculated
at
once
the
steamer
whistled
sharply
circled
backwards
into
the
roadstead
and
then
steamed
away
the
pier
soon
hid
her
but
her
smoke
showed
she
was
steering
towards
the
north
sea
does
this
mean
i
asked
must
be
some
other
quay
to
stop
at
nearer
the
town
said
davies
go
ashore
and
get
your
letters
we
had
made
a
long
and
painful
toilette
that
morning
and
felt
quite
shy
of
one
another
as
we
sculled
towards
the
pier
in
blue
suits
conventional
collars
and
brown
boots
it
was
the
first
time
for
two
years
that
i
had
seen
davies
in
anything
approaching
a
respectable
garb
but
a
fashionable
even
in
the
dead
season
exacts
respect
and
besides
we
had
friends
to
visit
we
tied
up
the
dinghy
to
an
iron
ladder
and
on
the
pier
found
our
inquisitor
of
the
night
before
smoking
in
the
doorway
of
a
shed
marked
master
after
some
civilities
we
inquired
about
the
steamer
the
answer
was
that
it
was
saturday
and
she
had
therefore
gone
on
to
juist
did
we
want
a
good
hotel
the
was
still
open
etc
by
jove
said
davies
as
we
walked
on
are
those
three
going
to
juist
should
have
thought
it
was
pretty
clear
they
on
their
way
to
memmert
davies
agreed
and
we
both
looked
longingly
westward
at
a
streak
on
the
sea
it
some
meeting
do
you
think
said
davies
like
it
we
shall
probably
find
the
here
and
find
her
we
did
soon
after
the
outermost
of
the
stack
of
galliots
on
the
farther
side
of
the
harbour
two
men
whose
faces
we
took
a
good
look
at
were
sitting
on
her
hatch
mending
a
sail
flooded
with
sun
yet
still
as
the
grave
the
town
was
like
a
dead
butterfly
for
whom
the
healing
rays
had
come
too
late
we
crossed
some
deserted
public
gardens
commanded
by
a
gorgeous
casino
its
porticos
heaped
with
chairs
and
tables
so
past
kiosques
and
great
white
hotels
with
boarded
windows
bazaars
and
booths
and
all
the
stale
lees
of
vulgar
frivolity
to
the
which
at
least
was
alive
i
received
a
packet
of
letters
and
purchased
a
local
from
which
we
learned
that
the
steamer
sailed
daily
to
borkum
norderney
touching
three
times
a
week
at
juist
weather
permitting
on
the
return
journey
it
was
due
at
norderney
at
then
i
inquired
the
way
to
the
jahreszeiten
whatever
your
principles
davies
i
said
are
going
to
have
the
best
breakfast
money
can
buy
we
got
the
whole
day
before
us
the
seasons
hotel
was
on
the
esplanade
facing
the
northern
beach
living
up
to
its
name
it
announced
on
an
illuminated
signboard
terms
for
winter
visitors
special
attention
to
invalids
etc
here
in
a
great
glass
restaurant
with
the
unruffled
blue
of
ocean
spread
out
before
us
we
ate
the
king
of
breakfasts
dismissed
the
waiter
and
over
long
and
fragrant
havanas
examined
my
mail
at
leisure
a
waste
of
good
diplomacy
was
my
first
thought
for
nothing
had
been
tampered
with
so
far
as
we
could
judge
from
the
minutest
scrutiny
directed
of
course
in
particular
to
the
franked
official
letters
for
to
my
surprise
there
were
two
from
whitehall
the
first
in
order
of
date
october
ran
take
another
week
by
all
yours
etc
the
second
marked
had
been
sent
to
my
home
address
and
forwarded
it
was
dated
october
and
cancelled
the
previous
letter
requesting
me
to
return
to
london
without
delay
am
sorry
to
abridge
your
holiday
but
we
are
very
busy
and
at
present
yours
etc
there
was
a
dry
postscript
to
the
effect
that
another
time
i
was
to
be
good
enough
to
leave
more
regular
and
definite
information
as
to
my
whereabouts
when
absent
afraid
i
never
got
this
i
said
handing
it
to
davies
wo
go
will
you
said
he
looking
nevertheless
with
unconcealed
awe
at
the
great
man
handwriting
under
the
haughty
official
crest
meanwhile
i
discovered
an
endorsement
on
a
corner
of
the
envelope
worry
it
only
the
chief
m
i
promptly
tore
up
the
envelope
there
are
domestic
mysteries
which
it
would
be
indecent
and
disloyal
to
reveal
even
to
one
best
friend
the
rest
of
my
letters
need
no
remark
i
smiled
over
some
and
blushed
over
others
all
were
voices
from
a
life
which
was
infinitely
far
away
davies
meanwhile
was
deep
in
the
foreign
intelligence
of
a
newspaper
spelling
it
out
line
by
line
and
referring
impatiently
to
me
for
the
meaning
of
words
he
said
suddenly
old
game
hear
that
siren
a
curtain
of
fog
had
grown
on
the
northern
horizon
and
was
drawing
shorewards
slowly
but
surely
does
matter
does
it
i
said
we
must
get
back
to
the
yacht
we
ca
leave
her
alone
in
the
fog
there
was
some
marketing
to
be
done
on
the
way
back
and
in
the
course
of
looking
for
the
shops
we
wanted
we
came
on
the
schwannall√©e
and
noted
its
position
before
we
reached
the
harbour
the
fog
was
on
us
charging
up
the
streets
in
dense
masses
happily
a
tramline
led
right
up
to
the
or
we
should
have
lost
our
way
and
wasted
time
which
in
the
event
was
of
priceless
value
presently
we
stumbled
up
against
the
harbour
office
which
was
our
landmark
for
the
steps
where
we
had
tied
up
the
dinghy
the
same
official
appeared
and
held
the
painter
while
we
handed
in
our
parcels
he
wanted
to
know
why
we
had
left
the
of
the
jahreszeiten
to
look
after
our
yacht
of
course
there
was
no
need
he
objected
there
would
be
no
traffic
moving
while
the
fog
lasted
and
the
fog
having
come
on
at
that
hour
had
come
to
stay
if
it
did
clear
he
would
keep
an
eye
on
the
yacht
for
us
we
thanked
him
but
thought
we
would
go
aboard
have
a
job
to
find
her
now
he
said
the
distance
was
eighty
yards
at
the
most
but
we
had
to
use
a
scientific
method
the
same
one
in
fact
that
davies
had
used
last
night
in
the
approach
to
the
eastern
pier
straight
out
at
right
angles
to
the
pier
he
said
now
i
did
so
davies
sounding
with
his
scull
between
the
strokes
he
found
the
bottom
after
twenty
yards
that
being
the
width
of
the
channel
at
this
point
then
we
turned
to
the
right
and
moved
gently
forward
keeping
touch
with
the
edge
of
the
for
all
the
world
like
blind
men
tapping
along
a
kerbstone
and
taking
short
excursions
from
it
till
the
hove
in
view
partly
luck
davies
commented
ought
to
have
had
the
compass
as
well
we
exchanged
shouts
with
the
man
on
the
pier
to
show
we
had
arrived
illustration
chart
b
of
juist
memmert
and
part
of
norderney
very
good
practice
that
sort
of
thing
said
davies
when
we
had
disembarked
got
a
sixth
sense
i
observed
far
could
you
go
like
that
know
let
have
another
try
i
ca
sit
still
all
day
explore
this
channel
not
go
to
memmert
i
said
in
fun
memmert
said
davies
slowly
jove
that
an
idea
heavens
man
i
was
joking
why
it
ten
mortal
miles
said
davies
absently
not
so
much
the
distance
the
time
ten
fifteen
quarter
ebb
what
am
i
talking
about
we
made
our
plans
last
night
but
seeing
him
to
my
amazement
serious
i
was
stung
by
the
splendour
of
the
idea
i
had
awakened
confidence
in
his
skill
was
second
nature
to
me
i
swept
straight
on
to
the
logic
of
the
thing
the
greatness
the
completeness
of
the
opportunity
if
by
a
miracle
it
could
be
seized
and
used
something
was
going
on
at
memmert
our
men
had
gone
there
here
were
we
ten
miles
away
in
a
smothering
blinding
fog
it
was
known
we
were
here
dollmann
and
grimm
knew
it
the
crew
of
the
knew
it
the
crew
of
the
knew
it
the
man
on
the
pier
whether
he
cared
or
not
knew
it
but
none
of
them
knew
davies
as
i
knew
him
would
anyone
dream
for
an
instant
a
second
said
davies
me
two
minutes
he
whipped
out
the
german
chart
exactly
should
we
go
the
word
tickled
me
hugely
the
dep√¥t
of
course
it
our
only
chance
then
there
are
two
routes
the
outside
one
by
the
open
sea
right
round
juist
and
doubling
south
the
simplest
but
the
longest
the
dep√¥t
at
the
south
point
of
memmert
and
memmert
nearly
two
miles
long
see
chart
b
far
would
that
way
be
miles
good
and
we
should
have
to
row
in
a
breaking
swell
most
of
the
way
close
to
land
of
the
question
it
too
public
too
if
it
clears
the
steamer
went
that
way
and
will
come
back
that
way
we
must
go
inside
over
the
sands
am
i
dreaming
though
can
you
possibly
find
the
way
should
wonder
but
i
do
believe
you
see
the
hitch
it
the
and
the
falling
tide
high
water
was
about
it
now
and
all
those
sands
are
drying
off
we
must
cross
the
see
gat
and
strike
that
boomed
channel
the
memmert
balje
strike
it
freeze
on
to
it
ca
cut
off
an
inch
and
pass
that
watershed
you
see
there
before
it
too
late
it
an
infernally
bad
one
i
can
see
not
even
a
dinghy
will
cross
it
for
an
hour
each
side
of
low
water
how
far
is
the
watershed
lord
what
are
we
talking
for
change
man
change
talk
while
we
changing
he
began
flinging
off
his
shore
clothes
and
i
did
the
same
at
least
five
miles
to
the
end
of
it
six
allowing
for
bends
hour
and
a
half
hard
pulling
two
allowing
for
checks
are
you
fit
you
have
to
pull
the
most
then
there
are
six
or
seven
more
miles
easier
ones
and
then
what
are
we
to
do
when
we
get
there
that
to
me
i
said
get
me
there
it
clears
we
get
there
bad
but
we
must
risk
that
if
it
clears
on
the
way
there
it
does
matter
by
this
route
we
shall
be
miles
from
land
about
getting
back
shall
have
a

the

with
i
left
davies
absorbed
in
the
charts
and
softly
went
about
my
own
functions
in
ten
minutes
he
was
on
the
ladder
beckoning
done
he
whispered
we
go
thought
it
out
yes
i
answered
this
was
only
roughly
true
for
i
could
not
have
stated
in
words
all
the
pros
and
cons
that
i
had
balanced
it
was
an
impulse
that
drove
me
forward
but
an
impulse
founded
on
reason
with
just
a
tinge
perhaps
of
superstition
for
the
quest
had
begun
in
a
fog
and
might
fitly
end
in
one
it
was
minutes
to
eleven
when
we
noiselessly
pushed
off
her
drift
whispered
davies
ebb
carry
her
past
the
pier
we
slid
by
the
and
she
disappeared
then
we
sat
without
speech
or
movement
for
about
five
minutes
while
the
gurgle
of
tide
through
piles
approached
and
passed
the
dinghy
appeared
to
be
motionless
just
as
a
balloon
in
the
clouds
may
appear
to
its
occupants
to
be
motionless
though
urged
by
a
current
of
air
in
reality
we
were
driving
out
of
the
riff
gat
into
the
see
gat
the
dinghy
swayed
to
a
light
swell
pull
said
davies
under
his
breath
it
long
and
steady
above
all
steady
both
arms
with
equal
force
i
was
on
the
he
to
me
on
the
stern
seat
his
left
hand
behind
him
on
the
tiller
his
right
forefinger
on
a
small
square
of
paper
which
lay
on
his
knees
this
was
a
section
cut
out
from
the
big
german
chart
see
chart
b
on
the
between
us
lay
the
compass
and
a
watch
between
these
three
objects
compass
watch
and
chart
his
eyes
darted
constantly
never
looking
up
or
out
save
occasionally
for
a
sharp
glance
over
the
side
at
the
flying
bubbles
to
see
if
i
was
sustaining
a
regular
speed
my
duty
was
to
be
his
automaton
the
human
equivalent
of
a
marine
engine
whose
revolutions
can
be
counted
and
used
as
data
by
the
navigator
my
arms
must
be
regular
as
twin
pistons
the
energy
that
drove
them
as
controllable
as
steam
it
was
a
hard
ideal
to
reach
for
the
complex
mortal
tends
to
rely
on
all
the
senses
god
has
given
him
so
unfitting
himself
for
mechanical
exactitude
when
a
sense
eyesight
in
my
case
fails
him
at
first
it
was
constantly
or
from
davies
accompanied
by
a
bubbling
from
the
rudder
wo
do
too
much
helm
said
davies
without
looking
up
your
stroke
but
listen
to
me
can
you
see
the
compass
card
i
come
forward
your
time
and
do
get
flurried
but
each
time
you
come
forward
have
a
good
look
at
it
the
course
is
you
take
the
opposite
and
keep
her
on
that
it
be
rough
but
it
save
some
helm
and
give
me
a
hand
free
if
i
want
it
i
did
as
he
said
not
without
effort
and
our
progress
gradually
became
smoother
till
he
had
no
need
to
speak
at
all
the
only
sound
now
was
one
like
the
gentle
simmer
of
a
saucepan
away
to
port
the
lisp
of
surf
i
knew
it
to
be
and
the
muffled
grunt
of
the
rowlocks
i
broke
the
silence
once
to
say
very
shallow
i
had
touched
sand
with
my
right
scull
talk
said
davies
about
half
an
hour
passed
and
then
he
added
sounding
to
his
other
occupations
went
the
lead
at
regular
intervals
and
he
steered
with
his
hip
while
pulling
in
the
line
very
little
of
it
went
out
at
first
then
less
still
again
i
struck
bottom
and
glancing
aside
saw
weeds
suddenly
he
got
a
deep
cast
and
the
dinghy
freed
from
the
slight
drag
which
shallow
water
always
inflicts
on
a
small
boat
leapt
buoyantly
forward
at
the
same
time
i
knew
by
boils
on
the
smooth
surface
that
we
were
in
a
strong
tideway
buse
tief
see
chart
b
muttered
davies
hard
now
and
steady
as
a
clock
for
a
hundred
yards
or
more
i
bent
to
my
sculls
and
made
her
fly
davies
was
getting
six
fathom
casts
till
just
as
suddenly
as
it
had
deepened
the
water
shoaled
ten
feet
six
three
one
the
dinghy
grounded
said
davies
her
off
pull
your
right
only
the
dinghy
spun
round
with
her
bow
to
arms
together
do
you
worry
about
the
compass
now
just
pull
and
listen
for
orders
there
a
tricky
bit
coming
he
put
aside
the
chart
kicked
the
lead
under
the
seat
and
kneeling
on
the
dripping
coils
of
line
sounded
continuously
with
the
of
the
boathook
a
stumpy
little
implement
notched
at
intervals
of
a
foot
and
often
before
used
for
the
same
purpose
all
at
once
i
was
aware
that
a
check
had
come
for
the
dinghy
swerved
and
doubled
like
a
hound
ranging
after
scent
her
he
said
suddenly
throw
out
the
grapnel
i
obeyed
and
we
brought
up
swinging
to
a
slight
current
whose
direction
davies
verified
by
the
compass
then
for
half
a
minute
he
gave
himself
up
to
concentrated
thought
what
struck
me
most
about
him
was
that
he
never
for
a
moment
strained
his
eyes
through
the
fog
a
useless
exercise
for
five
yards
or
so
was
the
radius
of
our
vision
which
however
i
could
not
help
indulging
in
while
i
rested
he
made
up
his
mind
and
we
were
off
again
straight
and
swift
as
an
arrow
this
time
and
in
water
deeper
than
the
boathook
i
could
see
by
his
face
that
he
was
taking
some
bold
expedient
whose
issue
hung
in
the
balance
again
we
touched
mud
and
the
joy
of
achievement
shone
in
his
eyes
backing
away
we
headed
west
and
for
the
first
time
he
began
to
gaze
into
the
fog
one
he
snapped
at
last
all
a
boom
one
of
the
usual
upright
saplings
glided
out
of
the
mist
he
caught
hold
of
it
and
we
brought
up
for
three
minutes
now
he
said
in
fairly
good
time
it
was
i
ate
some
biscuits
and
took
a
nip
of
whisky
while
davies
prepared
for
the
next
stage
we
had
reached
the
eastern
outlet
of
memmert
balje
the
channel
which
runs
east
and
west
behind
juist
island
direct
to
the
south
point
of
memmert
how
we
had
reached
it
was
incomprehensible
to
me
at
the
time
but
the
reader
will
understand
by
comparing
my
narrative
with
the
dotted
line
on
the
chart
i
add
this
brief
explanation
that
davies
method
had
been
to
cross
the
channel
called
the
buse
tief
and
strike
the
other
side
of
it
at
a
point
well
of
the
outlet
of
the
memmert
balje
in
view
of
the
northward
set
of
the
and
then
to
drop
back
north
and
feel
his
way
to
the
outlet
the
check
was
caused
by
a
deep
indentation
in
the
itzendorf
flat
a
with
a
wide
mouth
which
davies
was
very
near
mistaking
for
the
balje
itself
we
had
no
time
to
skirt
dents
so
deep
as
that
hence
the
dash
across
its
mouth
with
the
chance
of
missing
the
upper
lip
altogether
and
of
either
being
carried
out
to
sea
for
the
slightest
error
was
cumulative
or
straying
fruitlessly
along
the
edge
the
next
three
miles
were
the
most
critical
of
all
they
included
the
whose
length
and
depth
were
doubtful
they
included
too
the
crux
of
the
whole
passage
a
spot
where
the
channel
forks
our
own
branch
continuing
west
and
another
branch
diverging
from
it
we
must
row
against
time
and
yet
we
must
negotiate
that
crux
add
to
this
that
the
current
was
against
us
till
the
watershed
was
crossed
that
the
tide
was
just
at
its
most
baffling
stage
too
low
to
allow
us
to
risk
short
cuts
and
too
high
to
give
definition
to
the
banks
of
the
channel
and
that
the
compass
was
no
aid
whatever
for
the
minor
bends
up
said
davies
and
on
we
went
i
was
hugging
the
comfortable
thought
that
we
should
now
have
booms
on
our
starboard
for
the
whole
distance
on
our
starboard
i
say
for
experience
had
taught
us
that
all
channels
running
parallel
with
the
coast
and
islands
were
uniformly
boomed
on
the
northern
side
anyone
less
confident
than
davies
would
have
succumbed
to
the
temptation
of
slavishly
relying
on
these
marks
creeping
from
one
to
the
other
and
wasting
precious
time
but
davies
knew
our
friend
the
and
his
eccentricities
too
well
and
preferred
to
trust
to
his
sense
of
touch
which
no
fog
in
the
world
could
impair
if
we
happened
to
sight
one
well
and
good
we
should
know
which
side
of
the
channel
we
were
on
but
even
this
contingent
advantage
he
deliberately
sacrificed
after
a
short
distance
for
he
crossed
over
to
the
or
unboomed
side
and
steered
and
sounded
along
it
using
the
ltzendorf
flat
as
his
handrail
so
to
speak
he
was
compelled
to
do
this
he
told
me
afterwards
in
view
of
the
crux
where
the
converging
lines
of
booms
would
have
involved
us
in
irremediable
confusion
our
branch
was
the
southern
one
and
it
followed
that
we
must
use
the
southern
bank
and
defer
obtaining
any
help
from
booms
until
sure
we
were
past
that
critical
spot
for
an
hour
we
were
at
the
extreme
strain
i
of
physical
exertion
he
of
mental
i
could
not
get
into
a
steady
swing
for
little
checks
were
constant
my
right
scull
was
for
ever
skidding
on
mud
or
weeds
and
the
backward
suck
of
shoal
water
clogged
our
progress
once
we
were
both
of
us
out
in
the
slime
tugging
at
the
dinghy
sides
then
in
again
blundering
on
i
found
the
fog
bemusing
lost
all
idea
of
time
and
space
and
felt
like
a
senseless
marionette
kicking
and
jerking
to
a
mad
music
without
tune
or
time
the
misty
form
of
davies
as
he
sat
with
his
right
arm
swinging
rhythmically
forward
and
back
was
a
clockwork
figure
as
mad
as
myself
but
didactic
and
gibbering
in
his
madness
then
the
boathook
he
wielded
with
a
circular
sweep
began
to
take
grotesque
shapes
in
my
heated
fancy
now
it
was
the
antenna
of
a
groping
insect
now
the
crank
of
a
perambulator
now
the
alpenstock
of
a
lunatic
mountaineer
who
sits
in
his
chair
and
climbs
and
climbs
to
some
phantom
at
the
back
of
such
mind
as
was
left
me
lodged
two
insistent
thoughts
must
hurry
on
are
going
wrong
as
to
the
latter
take
a
through
a
london
fog
and
you
will
experience
the
same
thing
he
always
goes
the
way
you
think
is
wrong
rowing
i
remember
shouting
to
davies
once
having
become
aware
that
it
was
now
my
left
scull
which
splashed
against
obstructions
said
davies
crossed
over
and
i
relapsed
by
degrees
i
returned
to
sanity
thanks
to
improved
conditions
it
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
good
and
the
state
of
the
tide
though
it
threatened
us
with
total
failure
had
the
compensating
advantage
that
the
lower
it
fell
the
more
constricted
and
defined
became
our
channel
till
the
time
came
when
the
compass
and
boathook
were
alike
unnecessary
because
our
handrail
the
muddy
brink
of
the
channel
was
visible
to
the
eye
close
to
us
on
our
right
hand
always
now
for
the
crux
was
far
behind
and
the
northern
side
was
now
our
guide
all
that
remained
was
to
press
on
with
might
and
main
ere
the
bed
of
the
creek
dried
what
a
race
it
was
homeric
in
effect
a
struggle
of
men
with
gods
for
what
were
the
gods
but
forces
of
nature
personified
if
the
god
of
the
falling
tide
did
not
figure
in
the
olympian
circle
he
is
none
the
less
a
mighty
divinity
davies
left
his
post
and
rowed
stroke
under
our
united
efforts
the
dinghy
advanced
in
strenuous
leaps
hurling
miniature
rollers
on
the
bank
beside
us
my
palms
seasoned
as
they
were
were
smarting
with
watery
blisters
the
pace
was
too
hot
for
my
strength
and
breath
must
have
a
rest
i
gasped
i
think
we
over
it
said
davies
we
stopped
the
dinghy
dead
and
he
stabbed
over
the
side
with
the
boathook
it
passed
gently
astern
of
us
and
even
my
bewildered
brain
took
in
the
meaning
of
that
feet
and
the
current
with
us
over
it
he
said
paddle
on
while
you
rest
and
feed
it
was
a
few
minutes
past
one
and
we
still
as
he
calculated
had
eight
miles
before
us
allowing
for
bends
it
a
mere
question
of
muscle
he
said
i
took
his
word
for
it
and
munched
at
tongue
and
biscuits
as
for
muscle
we
were
both
in
hard
condition
he
was
fresh
and
what
distress
i
felt
was
mainly
due
to
spasmodic
exertion
culminating
in
that
desperate
spurt
as
for
the
fog
it
had
more
than
once
shown
a
faint
tendency
to
lift
growing
thinner
and
more
luminous
in
the
manner
of
fogs
always
to
settle
down
again
heavy
as
a
quilt
note
the
spot
marked
rest
approximately
correct
davies
says
and
the
course
of
the
channel
from
that
point
westward
you
will
see
it
broadening
and
deepening
to
the
dimensions
of
a
great
river
and
finally
merging
in
the
estuary
of
the
ems
note
too
that
its
northern
boundary
the
edge
of
the
now
uncovered
nordland
sand
leads
with
one
interruption
marked
a
direct
to
memmert
and
is
boomed
throughout
you
will
then
understand
why
davies
made
so
light
of
the
rest
of
his
problem
compared
with
the
feats
he
had
performed
it
was
child
play
for
he
always
had
that
visible
margin
to
keep
touch
with
if
he
chose
or
to
return
to
in
case
of
doubt
as
a
matter
of
fact
observe
our
dotted
line
he
made
two
daring
departures
from
it
the
first
purely
to
save
time
the
second
partly
to
save
time
and
partly
to
avoid
the
very
awkward
spot
marked
a
where
a
creek
with
booms
and
a
little
delta
of
its
own
interrupts
the
even
bank
during
the
first
of
these
departures
the
shortest
but
most
brilliant
he
let
me
do
the
rowing
and
devoted
himself
to
the
niceties
of
the
course
during
the
second
and
through
both
the
intermediate
stages
he
rowed
himself
with
occasional
pauses
to
inspect
the
chart
we
fell
into
a
long
measured
stroke
and
covered
the
miles
rapidly
scarcely
exchanging
a
single
word
till
at
the
end
of
a
long
pull
through
vacancy
davies
said
suddenly
where
are
we
to
land
a
sandbank
was
looming
over
us
crowned
by
a
lonely
boom
are
we
quarter
of
a
mile
from
memmert
time
is
it
three
xxii
the
quartette
his
de
was
achieved
and
for
the
moment
something
like
collapse
set
in
in
the
world
have
we
come
here
for
he
muttered
feel
a
bit
giddy
i
made
him
drink
some
whisky
which
revived
him
and
then
speaking
in
whispers
we
settled
certain
points
i
alone
was
to
land
davies
demurred
to
this
out
of
loyalty
but
common
sense
coinciding
with
a
strong
aversion
of
his
own
settled
the
matter
two
were
more
liable
to
detection
than
one
i
spoke
the
language
well
and
if
challenged
could
cover
my
retreat
with
a
gruff
word
or
two
in
my
woollen
overalls
oilskin
coat
with
a
pulled
well
over
my
eyes
i
should
pass
in
a
fog
for
a
frisian
davies
must
mind
the
dinghy
but
how
was
i
to
regain
it
i
hoped
to
do
so
without
help
by
using
the
edge
of
the
sand
but
if
he
heard
a
long

on

this

of

come
in
useful
but
you

it
looks
to
be
close
to
the

how
long

you

clear
were
fools
to
come
i
believe
said
davies
gloomily
no
in
a
place
like
this
here
the
best
i
can
see
on
the
chart
a
big
triangular
beacon
marked
on
the
very
point
of
memmert
you
pass
it
right
i
off
luck
said
davies
faintly
i
stepped
out
climbed
a
miry
glacis
of
five
or
six
feet
reached
hard
wet
sand
and
strode
away
with
the
sluggish
ripple
of
the
balje
on
my
left
hand
a
curtain
dropped
between
me
and
davies
and
i
was
alone
alone
but
how
i
thrilled
to
feel
the
firm
sand
rustle
under
my
boots
to
know
that
it
led
to
dry
land
where
whatever
befell
i
could
give
my
wits
full
play
i
clove
the
fog
briskly
good
heavens
what
was
that
i
stopped
short
and
listened
from
over
the
water
on
my
left
there
rang
out
dulled
by
fog
but
distinct
to
the
ear
three
double
strokes
on
a
bell
or
gong
i
looked
at
my
watch
at
anchor
i
said
to
myself
bells
in
the
afternoon
watch
i
knew
the
balje
was
here
a
deep
roadstead
where
a
vessel
entering
the
eastern
ems
might
very
well
anchor
to
ride
out
a
fog
i
was
just
stepping
forward
when
another
sound
followed
from
the
same
quarter
a
this
time
then
i
understood
only
sound
bugles
the
was
here
then
and
very
natural
too
i
thought
and
strode
on
the
sand
was
growing
drier
the
water
farther
beneath
me
then
came
a
thin
black
ribbon
of
weed
mark
a
few
cautious
steps
to
the
right
and
i
touched
tufts
of
marram
grass
it
was
memmert
i
pulled
out
the
chart
and
refreshed
my
memory
no
there
could
be
no
mistake
keep
the
sea
on
my
left
and
i
must
go
right
i
followed
the
ribbon
of
weed
keeping
it
just
in
view
but
walking
on
the
verge
of
the
grass
for
the
sake
of
silence
all
at
once
i
almost
tripped
over
a
massive
iron
bar
others
a
rusty
network
of
them
grew
into
being
above
and
around
me
like
the
arms
of
a
ghostly
polyp
infernal
spider
web
is
this
i
thought
and
stumbled
clear
i
had
strayed
into
the
base
of
a
gigantic
tripod
its
gaunt
legs
stayed
and
its
apex
lost
in
fog
the
beacon
i
remembered
a
hundred
yards
farther
and
i
was
down
on
my
knees
again
listening
with
might
and
main
for
several
little
sounds
were
in
the
air
voices
the
rasp
of
a
boat
keel
the
whistling
of
a
tune
these
were
straight
ahead
more
to
the
left
seaward
that
is
i
had
aural
evidence
of
the
presence
of
a
steamboat
a
small
one
for
the
hiss
of
escaping
steam
was
low
down
on
my
right
front
i
as
yet
heard
nothing
but
the
dep√¥t
must
be
there
i
prepared
to
strike
away
from
my
base
and
laid
the
compass
on
the
ground
nw
roughly
i
made
the
course
for
coming
back
i
repeated
inwardly
like
a
child
learning
a
lesson
then
of
my
two
allies
i
abandoned
one
the
beach
and
threw
myself
wholly
on
the
fog
the
game
i
said
to
myself
expects
you
nobody
will
recognize
you
i
advanced
in
rapid
stages
of
ten
yards
or
so
while
grass
disappeared
and
soft
sand
took
its
place
pitted
everywhere
with
footmarks
i
trod
carefully
for
obstructions
began
to
show
themselves
an
anchor
a
heap
of
rusty
cable
then
a
boat
bottom
upwards
and
lying
on
it
a
foul
old
meerschaum
pipe
i
paused
here
and
strained
my
ears
for
there
were
sounds
in
many
directions
the
same
whistling
behind
me
now
heavy
footsteps
in
front
and
somewhere
beyond
fifty
yards
away
i
reckoned
a
buzz
of
guttural
conversation
from
the
same
quarter
there
drifted
to
my
nostrils
the
acrid
odour
of
coarse
tobacco
then
a
door
banged
i
put
the
compass
in
my
pocket
thinking
placed
the
pipe
between
my
teeth
ugh
the
rank
savour
of
it
rammed
my
hard
down
and
slouched
on
in
the
direction
of
the
door
that
had
banged
a
voice
in
front
called
schicker
a
nearer
voice
that
of
the
man
whose
footsteps
i
had
heard
approaching
took
it
up
and
called
schicker
i
too
took
it
up
and
turning
my
back
called
schicker
as
gruffly
and
gutturally
as
i
could
the
footsteps
passed
quite
close
to
me
and
glancing
over
my
shoulder
i
saw
a
young
man
passing
dressed
very
like
me
but
wearing
a
sealskin
cap
instead
of
a
as
he
walked
he
seemed
to
be
counting
coins
in
his
palm
a
hail
came
back
from
the
beach
and
the
whistling
stopped
i
now
became
aware
that
i
was
on
a
beaten
track
these
meetings
were
hazardous
so
i
inclined
aside
but
not
without
misgivings
for
the
path
led
towards
the
buzz
of
talk
and
the
banging
door
and
these
were
my
only
guides
to
the
dep√¥t
suddenly
and
much
before
i
expected
it
i
knew
rather
than
saw
that
a
wall
was
in
front
of
me
now
it
was
visible
the
side
of
a
low
building
of
corrugated
iron
a
pause
to
reconnoitre
was
absolutely
necessary
but
the
knot
of
talkers
might
have
heard
my
footsteps
and
i
must
at
all
costs
not
suggest
the
groping
of
a
stranger
i
lit
a
match
two
and
sucked
heavily
as
i
had
seen
navvies
do
at
my
pipe
studying
the
trend
of
the
wall
by
reference
to
the
sounds
there
was
a
stale
dottle
wedged
in
the
bowl
and
loathsome
fumes
resulted
just
then
the
same
door
banged
again
another
name
which
i
forget
was
called
out
i
decided
that
i
was
at
the
end
of
a
rectangular
building
which
i
pictured
as
like
an
aldershot
and
that
the
door
i
heard
was
round
the
corner
to
my
left
a
knot
of
men
must
be
gathered
there
entering
it
by
turns
having
expectorated
noisily
i
followed
the
tin
wall
to
my
and
turning
a
corner
strolled
leisurely
on
passing
signs
of
domesticity
a
washtub
a
then
a
tiled
approach
to
an
open
door
i
now
was
aware
of
the
corner
of
a
second
building
also
of
zinc
parallel
to
the
first
but
taller
for
i
could
only
just
see
the
eave
i
was
just
going
to
turn
off
to
this
as
a
more
promising
field
for
exploration
when
i
heard
a
window
open
ahead
of
me
in
my
original
building
i
am
afraid
i
am
getting
obscure
so
i
append
a
rough
sketch
of
the
scene
as
i
partly
saw
and
chiefly
imagined
it
it
was
window
a
that
i
heard
open
from
it
i
could
just
distinguish
through
the
fog
a
hand
protrude
and
throw
something
out
the
hand
a
clean
one
with
a
gold
signet
ring
rested
for
an
instant
afterwards
on
the
sash
and
then
closed
the
window
illustration
sketch
memmert
salvage
depot
my
geography
was
clear
now
in
one
respect
that
window
belonged
to
the
same
room
as
the
banging
door
b
for
i
distinctly
heard
the
latter
open
and
shut
again
opposite
me
on
the
other
side
of
the
building
it
struck
me
that
it
might
be
interesting
to
see
into
that
room
the
game
i
reminded
myself
and
retreated
a
few
yards
back
on
tiptoe
then
turned
and
sauntered
coolly
past
the
window
puffing
my
villainous
pipe
and
taking
a
long
deliberate
look
into
the
interior
as
i
passed
the
more
deliberate
that
at
the
first
instant
i
realized
that
nobody
inside
was
disturbing
himself
about
me
as
i
had
expected
in
view
of
the
fog
and
the
time
there
was
artificial
light
within
my
mental
photograph
was
as
follows
a
small
room
with
varnished
deal
walls
and
furnished
like
an
office
in
the
far
corner
a
desk
grimm
sitting
at
it
on
a
high
stool
to
me
counting
money
opposite
him
in
an
awkward
attitude
a
burly
fellow
in
seaman
dress
holding
a
helmet
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
deal
table
and
on
it
something
big
and
black
lolling
on
chairs
near
it
their
backs
to
me
and
their
faces
turned
towards
the
desk
and
the
diver
two
men
von
br√ºning
and
an
older
man
with
a
bald
yellow
head
dollmann
companion
on
the
steamer
beyond
a
doubt
on
another
chair
with
its
back
actually
tilted
against
the
window
dollmann
such
were
the
principal
features
of
the
scene
for
details
i
had
to
make
another
inspection
stooping
low
i
crept
back
quiet
as
a
cat
till
i
was
beneath
the
window
and
as
i
calculated
directly
behind
dollmann
chair
then
with
great
caution
i
raised
my
head
there
was
only
one
pair
of
eyes
in
the
room
that
i
feared
in
the
least
and
that
was
grimm
who
sat
in
profile
to
me
farthest
away
i
instantly
put
dollmann
back
between
grimm
and
me
and
then
made
my
scrutiny
as
i
made
it
i
could
feel
a
cold
sweat
distilling
on
my
forehead
and
tickling
my
spine
not
from
fear
or
excitement
but
from
pure
ignominy
for
beyond
all
doubt
i
was
present
at
the
meeting
of
a
salvage
company
it
was
and
the
directors
appeared
to
be
taking
stock
of
work
done
that
was
all
over
the
door
was
an
old
engraving
of
a
under
full
sail
pinned
on
the
wall
a
chart
and
the
plan
of
a
ship
relics
of
the
wrecked
frigate
abounded
on
a
shelf
above
the
stove
was
a
small
pyramid
of
encrusted
and
supported
on
nails
at
odd
places
on
the
walls
were
corroded
old
pistols
and
what
i
took
to
be
the
remains
of
a
sextant
in
a
corner
of
the
floor
sat
a
hoary
little
carronade
carriage
and
all
none
of
these
things
affected
me
so
much
as
a
pile
of
lumber
on
the
floor
not
firewood
but
unmistakable
black
as
still
caked
in
places
with
the
mud
of
ages
nor
was
it
the
mere
sight
of
this
lumber
that
dumbfounded
me
it
was
the
fact
that
a
fragment
of
it
a
balk
of
curved
timber
garnished
with
some
massive
bolts
lay
on
the
table
and
was
evidently
an
object
of
earnest
interest
the
diver
had
turned
and
was
arguing
with
gestures
over
it
von
br√ºning
and
grimm
were
pressing
another
view
the
diver
shook
his
head
frequently
finally
shrugged
his
shoulders
made
a
salutation
and
left
the
room
their
movements
had
kept
me
ducking
my
head
pretty
frequently
but
i
now
grew
almost
reckless
as
to
whether
i
was
seen
or
not
all
the
weaknesses
of
my
theory
crowded
on
me
the
arguments
davies
had
used
at
bensersiel
fr√§ulein
dollmann
thoughtless
talk
the
ease
comparatively
with
which
i
had
reached
this
spot
not
a
barrier
to
cross
or
a
lock
to
force
the
publicity
of
their
passage
to
memmert
by
dollmann
his
friend
and
grimm
and
now
this
glimpse
of
routine
in
a
few
moments
i
sank
from
depth
to
depth
of
scepticism
where
were
my
mines
torpedoes
and
submarine
boats
and
where
my
imperial
conspirators
was
gold
after
all
at
the
bottom
of
this
sordid
mystery
dollmann
after
all
a
commonplace
criminal
the
ladder
of
proof
i
had
mounted
tottered
and
shook
beneath
me
be
a
fool
said
the
faint
voice
of
reason
are
your
four
men
wait
two
more
came
into
the
room
in
quick
succession
and
received
wages
one
looking
like
a
fireman
the
other
of
a
superior
type
the
skipper
of
a
tug
say
there
was
another
discussion
with
this
latter
over
the
balk
of
and
this
man
too
shrugged
his
shoulders
his
departure
appeared
to
end
the
meeting
grimm
shut
up
a
ledger
and
i
shrank
down
on
my
knees
for
a
general
shifting
of
chairs
began
at
the
same
time
from
the
other
side
of
the
building
i
heard
my
knot
of
men
retreating
beachwards
spitting
and
chatting
as
they
went
presently
someone
walked
across
the
room
towards
my
window
i
sidled
away
on
all
fours
rose
and
flattened
myself
erect
against
the
wall
a
sickening
despondency
on
me
my
intention
to
slink
away
as
soon
as
the
coast
was
clear
but
the
sound
that
came
next
pricked
me
like
an
electric
shock
it
was
the
tinkle
and
scrape
of
quick
as
thought
i
was
back
in
my
old
position
to
find
my
view
barred
by
a
cretonne
curtain
it
was
in
one
piece
with
no
chink
for
my
benefit
but
it
did
not
hang
straight
bulging
towards
me
under
the
pressure
of
something
human
shoulders
by
the
shape
dollmann
i
concluded
was
still
in
his
old
place
i
now
was
exasperated
to
find
that
i
could
scarcely
hear
a
word
that
was
said
not
even
by
pressing
my
ear
against
the
glass
it
was
not
that
the
speakers
were
of
set
purpose
hushing
their
voices
they
used
an
ordinary
tone
for
intimate
discussion
but
the
glass
and
curtain
deadened
the
actual
words
still
i
was
soon
able
to
distinguish
general
characteristics
von
br√ºning
voice
the
only
one
i
had
ever
heard
before
i
recognized
at
once
he
was
on
the
left
of
the
table
and
dollmann
i
knew
from
his
position
the
third
was
a
harsh
croak
belonging
to
the
old
gentleman
whom
for
convenience
i
shall
prematurely
begin
to
call
herr
b√∂hme
it
was
too
old
a
voice
to
be
grimm
besides
it
had
the
ring
of
authority
and
was
dealing
at
the
moment
in
sharp
interrogations
three
of
its
sentences
i
caught
in
their
entirety
was
that
went
no
farther
and
long
out
of
the
question
dollmann
voice
though
nearest
to
me
was
the
least
audible
of
all
it
was
a
dogged
monotone
and
what
was
that
odd
movement
of
the
curtain
at
his
back
yes
his
hands
were
behind
him
clutching
and
kneading
a
fold
of
the
cretonne
are
feeling
uncomfortable
my
friend
was
my
comment
suddenly
he
threw
back
his
head
i
saw
the
dent
of
it
and
spoke
up
so
that
i
could
not
miss
a
word
well
sir
you
shall
see
them
at
supper
i
will
ask
them
both
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
i
instantly
looked
at
my
watch
though
it
takes
long
to
write
what
i
have
described
but
the
time
was
only
a
quarter
to
four
he
added
something
about
the
fog
and
his
chair
creaked
ducking
promptly
i
heard
the
jar
and
as
ever
report
herr
dollmann
said
b√∂hme
curtly
dollmann
left
the
window
and
moved
his
chair
up
to
the
table
the
other
two
drew
in
theirs
and
settled
themselves
said
dollmann
as
if
announcing
a
heading
it
was
an
easy
word
to
catch
rapped
out
sharp
and
you
can
imagine
how
it
startled
me
where
you
been
for
the
last
month
i
said
to
myself
a
map
crackled
and
i
knew
they
were
bending
over
it
while
dollmann
explained
something
but
now
my
exasperation
became
acute
for
not
a
syllable
more
reached
me
squatting
back
on
my
heels
i
cast
about
for
expedients
should
i
steal
round
and
try
the
door
too
dangerous
climb
to
the
roof
and
listen
down
the
too
noisy
and
generally
hopeless
i
tried
for
a
downward
purchase
on
the
upper
half
of
the
window
which
was
of
the
simple
sort
in
two
sections
working
vertically
no
use
it
resisted
gentle
pressure
would
start
with
a
sudden
jar
if
i
forced
it
i
pulled
out
davies
knife
and
worked
the
point
of
the
blade
between
sash
and
frame
to
give
it
play
no
result
but
the
knife
was
a
nautical
one
with
a
as
well
as
a
big
blade
just
now
the
door
within
opened
and
shut
again
and
i
heard
steps
approaching
round
the
corner
to
my
right
i
had
the
presence
of
mind
not
to
lose
a
moment
but
moved
silently
away
blessing
the
deep
frisian
sand
round
the
corner
of
the
big
parallel
building
someone
whom
i
could
not
see
walked
past
till
his
boots
clattered
on
tiles
next
resounded
on
boards
in
his
i
inferred
the
precious
minutes
ebbed
away
five
ten
fifteen
had
he
gone
for
good
i
dared
not
return
otherwise
eighteen
he
was
coming
out
this
time
i
stole
forward
boldly
when
the
man
had
just
passed
dimly
saw
a
figure
and
clearly
enough
the
glint
of
a
white
paper
he
was
holding
he
made
his
circuit
and
the
room
here
i
felt
and
conquered
a
relapse
to
scepticism
this
is
an
important
conclave
why
do
they
set
guards
answer
the
only
possible
one
they
stand
alone
their
like
we
had
met
hitherto
know
nothing
the
real
object
of
this
salvage
company
a
poor
speculation
i
opined
is
solely
to
afford
a
pretext
for
the
conclave
the
curtain
even
there
are
maps
stupid
i
was
back
again
at
the
window
but
as
impotent
as
ever
against
that
even
stream
of
low
confidential
talk
but
i
would
not
give
up
fate
and
the
fog
had
brought
me
here
the
one
solitary
soul
perhaps
who
by
the
chain
of
circumstances
had
both
the
will
and
the
opportunity
to
wrest
their
secret
from
these
four
men
the
where
the
lower
half
of
the
window
met
the
sill
it
sank
into
a
shallow
groove
i
thrust
the
point
of
the
spike
down
into
the
interstice
between
sash
and
frame
and
heaved
with
a
slowly
increasing
force
which
i
could
regulate
to
the
fraction
of
an
ounce
on
this
powerful
lever
the
sash
gave
with
the
faintest
possible
protest
and
by
imperceptible
degrees
i
lifted
it
to
the
top
of
the
groove
and
the
least
bit
above
it
say
half
an
inch
in
all
but
it
made
an
appreciable
difference
to
the
sounds
within
as
when
you
remove
your
foot
from
a
piano
soft
pedal
i
could
do
no
more
for
there
was
no
further
fulcrum
for
the
spike
and
i
dared
not
gamble
away
what
i
had
won
by
using
my
hands
hope
sank
again
when
i
placed
my
cheek
on
the
damp
sill
and
my
ear
to
the
chink
my
men
were
close
round
the
table
referring
to
papers
which
i
heard
rustle
dollmann
was
evidently
over
and
i
rarely
heard
his
voice
grimm
occasionally
von
br√ºning
and
b√∂hme
frequently
but
as
before
it
was
the
latter
only
that
i
could
ever
count
on
for
an
intelligible
word
for
unfortunately
the
villains
of
the
piece
plotted
without
any
regard
to
dramatic
fitness
or
to
my
interests
immersed
in
a
subject
with
which
they
were
all
familiar
they
were
allusive
elliptic
and
persistently
technical
many
of
the
words
i
did
catch
were
unknown
to
me
the
rest
were
for
the
most
part
either
letters
of
the
alphabet
or
statistical
figures
of
depth
distance
and
once
or
twice
of
time
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
recurred
often
and
seemed
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
to
represent
the
key
to
the
cipher
the
numbers
clustering
round
them
were
mostly
very
small
with
decimals
what
maddened
me
most
was
the
scarcity
of
plain
nouns
to
report
what
i
heard
to
the
reader
would
be
impossible
so
chaotic
was
most
of
it
that
it
left
no
impression
on
my
own
memory
all
i
can
do
is
to
tell
him
what
fragments
stuck
and
what
nebulous
classification
i
involved
the
letters
ran
from
a
to
g
and
my
best
continuous
chance
came
when
b√∂hme
reading
rapidly
from
a
paper
i
think
went
through
the
letters
backwards
from
g
adding
remarks
to
each
thus
completed
bad
metres
kilometres
weeks
thirty
and
so
on
another
time
he
went
through
this
list
again
only
naming
each
letter
himself
and
receiving
laconic
answers
from
grimm
answers
which
seemed
to
be
numbers
but
i
could
not
be
sure
for
minutes
together
i
caught
nothing
but
the
scratching
of
pens
and
inarticulate
mutterings
but
out
of
the
i
picked
five
pearls
four
sibilant
nouns
and
a
name
that
i
knew
before
the
nouns
were
tugs
depth
of
water
railway
pilots
the
name
also
sibilant
and
thus
easier
to
hear
was
two
or
three
times
i
had
to
stand
back
and
ease
my
cramped
neck
and
on
each
occasion
i
looked
at
my
watch
for
i
was
listening
against
time
just
as
we
had
rowed
against
time
we
were
going
to
be
asked
to
supper
and
must
be
back
aboard
the
yacht
in
time
to
receive
the
invitation
the
fog
still
brooded
heavily
and
the
light
always
bad
was
growing
worse
how
would
get
back
how
had
they
come
from
juist
could
we
forestall
them
questions
of
time
tide
distance
just
the
odious
sort
of
sums
i
was
unfit
to
cope
with
were
distracting
my
attention
when
it
should
have
been
wholly
elsewhere
now
it
was
past
when
davies
said
the
bank
would
cover
i
should
have
to
make
for
the
beacon
but
it
was
fatally
near
that
steamboat
path
and
i
still
at
intervals
heard
voices
from
there
it
must
have
been
about
when
there
was
another
shifting
of
chairs
within
then
someone
rose
collected
papers
and
went
out
someone
else
rising
therefore
grimm
followed
him
there
was
silence
in
the
room
for
a
minute
and
after
that
for
the
first
time
i
heard
some
plain
colloquial
german
with
no
accompaniment
of
scratching
or
rustling
must
wait
for
this
i
thought
and
waited
insists
on
coming
said
b√∂hme
an
ejaculation
of
surprise
and
protest
from
von
br√ºning
said
the
tide
serves
well
the
of
course
tell
grimm
to
be
ready
an
inaudible
question
from
von
br√ºning
any
weather
a
laugh
from
von
br√ºning
and
some
words
i
could
not
catch
one
with
half
a
load
the
station
how
the
fog
this
appeared
to
be
really
the
end
both
men
rose
and
steps
came
towards
the
window
i
leapt
aside
as
i
heard
it
thrown
up
and
covered
by
the
noise
backed
into
safety
von
br√ºning
called
and
that
and
the
open
window
decided
me
that
my
line
of
advance
was
now
too
dangerous
to
retreat
by
the
only
alternative
was
to
make
a
circuit
round
the
bigger
of
the
two
buildings
and
an
interminable
circuit
it
seemed
and
all
the
while
i
knew
my
was
growing
nugatory
i
passed
a
padlocked
door
two
corners
and
faced
the
void
of
fog
out
came
the
compass
and
i
steadied
myself
for
the
sum
before
i
farther
to
the
eastward
now
east
will
about
do
and
off
i
went
with
an
error
of
four
whole
points
over
tussocks
and
deep
sand
the
beach
seemed
much
farther
off
than
i
had
thought
and
i
began
to
get
alarmed
puzzled
over
the
compass
several
times
and
finally
realized
that
i
had
lost
my
way
i
had
the
sense
not
to
make
matters
worse
by
trying
to
find
it
again
and
as
the
lesser
of
two
evils
blew
my
whistle
softly
at
first
then
louder
the
bray
of
a
foghorn
sounded
right
me
i
whistled
again
and
then
ran
for
my
life
the
horn
sounding
at
intervals
in
three
or
four
minutes
i
was
on
the
beach
and
in
the
dinghy
xxiii
a
change
of
tactics
we
pushed
off
without
a
word
and
paddled
out
of
sight
of
the
beach
a
voice
was
approaching
hailing
us
back
whispered
davies
we
a
galliot
i
shouted
am
i
memmert
came
back
are
you
bound
whispered
davies
i
bawled
a
sentence
ending
with
was
returned
flood
tearing
east
whispered
davies
still
we
heard
no
more
and
after
a
few
minutes
drifting
luck
said
davies
or
two
clues
and
an
invitation
to
supper
the
clues
i
left
till
later
the
invitation
was
the
thing
and
i
explained
its
urgency
will
get
back
said
davies
the
fog
lasts
the
steamer
sure
to
be
late
can
count
for
nothing
i
answered
was
some
little
steamboat
off
the
dep√¥t
and
the
fog
may
lift
which
is
our
quickest
way
this
tide
a
to
norderney
by
compass
we
shall
have
water
over
all
the
banks
he
had
all
his
preparations
made
the
lamp
lit
in
advance
the
compass
in
position
and
we
started
at
once
he
at
the
where
he
had
better
control
over
the
boat
nose
lamp
and
compass
on
the
floor
between
us
twilight
thickened
into
darkness
a
choking
pasty
darkness
and
still
we
sped
unfalteringly
over
that
trackless
waste
sitting
and
swinging
in
our
little
pool
of
stifled
orange
light
to
drown
fatigue
and
suspense
i
conned
over
my
clues
and
tried
to
carve
into
my
memory
every
fugitive
word
i
had
overheard
are
there
seven
of
round
here
i
called
back
to
davies
once
thinking
of
a
to
g
i
added
for
no
answer
came
see
a
star
was
my
next
word
after
a
long
interval
gone
there
it
is
again
right
aft
borkum
light
said
davies
presently
fog
lifting
a
keen
wind
from
the
west
struck
our
faces
and
as
swiftly
as
it
had
come
the
fog
rolled
away
from
us
in
one
mighty
mass
stripping
clean
and
pure
the
starry
dome
of
heaven
still
bright
with
the
western
and
beginning
to
redden
in
the
east
to
the
rising
moon
norderney
light
was
flashing
ahead
and
davies
could
take
his
tired
eyes
from
the
pool
of
light
was
all
he
uttered
in
the
way
of
gratitude
for
this
mercy
and
i
felt
very
much
the
same
for
in
a
fog
davies
in
a
dinghy
was
a
match
for
a
steamer
in
a
clear
he
lost
his
handicap
it
was
a
quarter
to
seven
hour
do
it
if
we
buck
up
he
pronounced
after
taking
a
rough
bearing
with
the
two
lights
he
pointed
out
a
star
to
me
which
we
were
to
keep
exactly
astern
and
again
i
applied
to
their
labour
my
aching
back
and
smarting
palms
did
you
say
about
seven
of
something
said
davies
are
there
seven
of
hereabouts
of
course
said
davies
that
the
clue
then
followed
the
most
singular
of
all
our
confabulations
two
memories
are
better
than
one
and
the
sooner
i
carved
the
cipher
into
his
memory
as
well
as
mine
the
better
record
we
should
have
so
with
rigid
economy
of
breath
i
snapped
out
all
my
story
and
answered
his
breathless
questions
it
saved
me
from
being
mesmerized
by
the
star
and
both
of
us
from
the
consciousness
of
at
chatham
the
blackguard
he
hissed
do
you
make
of
it
i
asked
about
battleships
mines
forts
he
said
about
the
ems
emden
wilhelmshaven
about
transports
believe
i
was
right
after
all
something
to
do
with
the
channels
behind
islands
and
so
that
outworn
creed
took
a
new
lease
of
life
though
for
my
part
the
words
that
clashed
with
it
were
those
that
had
sunk
the
deepest
i
protested
town
behind
bensersiel
lotsen
schleppboote
spluttered
davies
eisenbahn
from
me
and
so
on
i
should
earn
the
just
execration
of
the
reader
if
i
continued
to
report
such
a
dialogue
suffice
to
say
that
we
realized
very
soon
that
the
substance
of
the
plot
was
still
a
riddle
on
the
other
hand
there
was
fresh
scent
abundance
of
it
and
the
question
was
already
taking
shape
were
we
to
follow
it
up
or
revert
to
last
decision
and
strike
with
what
weapons
we
had
it
was
a
pressing
question
too
the
last
of
many
was
there
to
be
no
end
to
the
emergencies
of
this
crowded
day
pressing
for
reasons
i
could
not
define
while
convinced
that
we
must
be
ready
with
an
answer
by
meantime
we
were
nearing
norderney
the
see
gat
was
crossed
and
with
the
last
of
the
flood
tide
fair
beneath
us
and
the
red
light
on
the
west
pier
burning
ahead
we
began
insensibly
to
relax
our
efforts
but
i
dared
not
rest
for
i
was
at
that
point
of
exhaustion
when
mechanical
movement
was
my
only
hope
astern
i
said
thickly
white
and
red
said
davies
south
though
now
a
neat
triangle
of
gems
topaz
ruby
and
emerald
hung
steady
behind
us
east
said
davies
up
steamer
from
juist
no
by
jove
too
small
what
is
it
on
we
laboured
while
the
gems
waxed
in
brilliancy
as
the
steamer
overhauled
us
said
davies
seem
to
know
those
lights
the
launch
do
let
be
caught
rowing
like
madmen
in
a
muck
sweat
paddle
inshore
a
bit
he
was
right
and
as
in
a
dream
i
saw
hurrying
and
palpitating
up
the
same
little
pinnace
that
had
towed
us
out
of
bensersiel
done
for
now
i
remember
thinking
for
the
guilt
of
the
runaway
was
strong
in
me
and
an
old
remark
of
von
br√ºning
about
was
in
my
ears
but
she
was
level
with
and
past
us
before
i
could
sink
far
into
despair
of
them
behind
the
hood
said
davies
are
we
to
do
i
answered
and
essayed
a
feeble
stroke
but
the
blade
scuttered
over
the
surface
wait
about
for
a
bit
said
davies
late
anyhow
if
they
go
to
the
yacht
they
think
we
ashore
shore
clothes
lying
about
you
up
to
talking
but
we
must
the
least
suspicion
do
for
us
now
me
your
scull
old
chap
and
put
on
your
coat
he
extinguished
the
lantern
lit
a
pipe
and
then
rowed
slowly
on
while
i
sat
on
a
slack
heap
in
the
stern
and
devoted
my
last
resources
of
will
to
the
emancipation
of
the
spirit
from
the
tired
flesh
in
ten
minutes
or
so
we
were
rounding
the
pier
and
there
was
the
yacht
against
the
sky
i
saw
too
that
the
launch
was
alongside
of
her
and
told
davies
so
then
i
lit
a
cigarette
and
made
a
lamentable
effort
to
whistle
davies
followed
suit
and
emitted
a
strange
melody
which
i
took
to
be
sweet
home
but
he
has
not
the
slightest
ear
for
music
they
on
board
i
believe
said
i
cabin
lighted
ahoy
there
i
shouted
as
we
came
up
that
evening
sir
said
a
sailor
who
was
fending
off
the
yacht
with
a
boathook
commander
von
br√ºning
launch
i
think
the
gentlemen
want
to
see
you
before
we
could
answer
an
exclamation
of
here
they
are
came
from
the
deck
of
the
and
the
dim
form
of
von
br√ºning
himself
semerged
from
the
companionway
there
was
something
of
a
scuffle
down
below
which
the
commander
nearly
succeeded
in
drowning
by
the
breeziness
of
his
greeting
meanwhile
the
ladder
creaked
under
fresh
weight
and
dollmann
appeared
that
you
herr
davies
he
said
herr
dollmann
said
davies
are
you
i
must
explain
that
we
had
floated
up
between
the
yacht
and
the
launch
whose
sailors
had
passed
her
a
little
aside
in
order
to
give
us
room
her
starboard
was
just
behind
and
above
us
pouring
its
green
rays
obliquely
over
the
deck
of
the
while
we
and
the
dinghy
were
in
deep
shadow
between
the
most
studied
calculation
could
not
have
secured
us
more
favourable
conditions
for
a
moment
which
i
had
always
dreaded
the
meeting
of
davies
and
dollmann
the
former
having
shortened
his
sculls
just
sat
where
he
was
half
turned
towards
the
yacht
and
looking
up
at
his
enemy
no
lineament
of
his
own
face
could
have
been
visible
to
the
latter
while
those
pitiless
green
rays
you
know
their
ravaging
effect
on
the
human
physiognomy
struck
full
on
dollmann
face
it
was
my
first
fair
view
of
it
at
close
quarters
and
secure
in
my
background
of
gloom
i
feasted
with
a
luxury
of
superstitious
abhorrence
on
the
livid
smiling
mask
that
for
a
few
moments
stooped
peering
down
towards
davies
one
of
the
caprices
of
the
crude
light
was
to
obliterate
or
at
any
rate
so
penetrate
beard
and
moustache
as
to
reveal
in
outline
lips
and
chin
the
features
in
which
defects
of
character
are
most
surely
betrayed
especially
when
your
victim
smiles
accuse
me
if
you
will
of
stooping
to
melodramatic
embroidery
object
that
my
own
prejudiced
fancy
contributed
to
the
result
but
i
can
nevertheless
never
efface
the
impression
of
malignant
perfidy
and
base
passion
exaggerated
to
caricature
that
i
received
in
those
few
instants
another
caprice
of
the
light
was
to
identify
the
man
with
the
portrait
of
him
when
younger
and
in
the
frontispiece
of
his
own
book
and
another
still
the
most
repulsively
whimsical
of
all
was
to
call
forth
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
sweet
young
girl
who
had
been
with
us
yesterday
enough
i
shall
never
offend
again
in
this
way
in
reality
i
am
much
more
inclined
to
laugh
than
shudder
over
this
meeting
for
meanwhile
the
third
of
our
guests
had
with
stertorous
puffing
risen
to
the
stage
for
all
the
world
like
a
demon
out
of
a
trapdoor
specially
when
he
entered
the
zone
of
that
unearthly
light
and
there
they
stood
in
a
row
like
delinquents
at
judgement
while
we
the
true
culprits
had
only
passively
to
accept
explanations
of
course
these
were
plausible
enough
dollmann
having
seen
the
yacht
in
port
that
morning
had
called
on
his
return
from
memmert
to
ask
us
to
supper
finding
no
one
aboard
and
concluding
we
were
ashore
he
had
meant
to
leave
a
note
for
davies
in
the
cabin
his
friend
herr
b√∂hme
distinguished
engineer
was
anxious
to
see
over
the
little
vessel
that
had
come
so
far
and
he
knew
that
davies
would
not
mind
the
intrusion
not
at
all
said
davies
would
not
they
stop
and
have
drinks
no
but
would
we
come
to
supper
at
dollmann
villa
with
pleasure
said
davies
but
we
had
to
change
first
up
to
this
point
we
had
been
masters
of
the
situation
but
here
von
br√ºning
who
alone
of
the
three
appeared
to
be
entirely
at
his
ease
made
the
have
you
been
he
asked
rowing
about
since
the
fog
cleared
said
davies
i
suppose
he
thought
that
evasion
would
pass
muster
but
as
he
spoke
i
noticed
to
my
horror
that
a
stray
beam
of
light
was
playing
on
the
bunch
of
white
that
adorned
one
of
the
rowlocks
for
we
had
forgotten
to
remove
these
appendages
so
i
added
ducks
again
and
lifting
one
of
the
guns
let
the
light
flash
on
its
barrel
to
my
own
ears
my
voice
sounded
husky
and
distant
ducks
laughed
von
br√ºning
luck
i
suppose
said
davies
it
ought
to
be
a
good
time
after
sunset
with
a
rising
tide
and
the
banks
covered
saw
some
said
davies
sullenly
tell
you
what
my
zealous
young
sportsmen
you
rash
to
leave
your
boat
at
anchor
here
after
dark
without
a
light
i
came
aboard
to
find
your
lamp
and
set
it
thanks
said
davies
took
it
with
us
see
to
shoot
by
we
laughed
uncomfortably
and
davies
compassed
a
wonderful
german
phrase
to
the
effect
that
might
come
in
useful
happily
the
matter
went
no
farther
for
the
position
was
a
strained
one
at
the
best
and
would
not
bear
lengthening
the
launch
went
alongside
and
the
invaders
evacuated
british
soil
looking
for
all
von
flippant
nonchalance
a
rather
crestfallen
party
so
much
so
that
acute
as
was
my
anxiety
i
took
courage
to
whisper
to
davies
while
the
transhipment
of
herr
b√∂hme
was
proceeding
dollmann
to
stay
while
we
dress
he
whispered
on
say
herr
dollmann
said
davies
you
stay
on
board
with
us
while
we
dress
there
a
lot
to
tell
you
and
and
we
can
follow
on
with
you
when
we
ready
dollmann
had
not
yet
stepped
into
the
launch
pleasure
he
said
but
there
followed
an
ominous
silence
broken
by
von
br√ºning
come
along
dollmann
and
let
them
alone
he
said
brusquely
be
horribly
in
the
way
down
there
and
we
shall
never
get
any
supper
if
you
keep
them
yarning
it
now
a
eight
grumbled
herr
b√∂hme
from
his
corner
behind
the
hood
dollmann
submitted
and
excused
himself
and
the
launch
steamed
away
think
i
twig
said
davies
as
he
helped
almost
hoisted
me
aboard
risky
though
eh
knew
they
object
only
wanted
to
make
sure
the
cabin
was
just
as
we
had
left
it
our
shore
clothes
lying
in
disorder
on
the
bunks
a
locker
or
two
half
open
i
wonder
what
they
did
down
here
said
davies
for
my
part
i
went
straight
to
the
bookshelf
anything
strike
you
about
this
i
asked
kneeling
on
the
sofa
shifted
said
davies
swear
it
was
at
the
end
before
does
matter
anything
else
jove
where
dollmann
book
here
all
right
but
not
where
it
should
be
i
had
been
reading
it
you
remember
overnight
and
in
the
morning
had
replaced
it
in
full
view
among
the
other
books
i
now
found
it
behind
them
in
a
wrenched
attitude
which
showed
that
someone
who
had
no
time
to
spare
had
pushed
it
roughly
inwards
do
you
make
of
that
said
davies
he
produced
long
drinks
and
we
allowed
ourselves
ten
minutes
of
absolute
rest
stretched
at
full
length
on
the
sofas
do
trust
dollmann
i
said
spotted
that
at
memmert
even
when
they
were
talking
about
you
and
me
he
was
on
his
defence
and
in
a
deuce
of
a
funk
too
b√∂hme
was
pressing
him
hard
again
at
the
end
when
he
left
the
room
followed
by
grimm
who
certain
was
sent
to
watch
him
it
was
while
he
was
away
that
the
other
two
arranged
that
rendezvous
for
the
night
of
the
and
again
just
now
when
you
asked
him
to
stay
i
believe
it
working
out
as
i
thought
it
would
von
br√ºning
and
through
him
b√∂hme
who
is
the
from
bremen
know
the
story
of
that
short
cut
and
suspect
that
it
was
an
attempt
on
your
life
dollmann
dare
confess
to
that
because
morality
apart
it
could
only
have
been
prompted
by
extreme
necessity
that
is
by
the
knowledge
that
you
were
really
dangerous
and
not
merely
an
inquisitive
stranger
now
know
his
motive
but
they
do
yet
the
position
of
that
book
proves
it
shoved
it
in
prevent
them
seeing
it
there
no
earthly
reason
why
should
have
hidden
it
we
getting
on
said
davies
shows
they
know
his
real
name
or
why
should
he
shove
the
book
in
but
they
do
know
he
wrote
a
book
and
that
i
have
a
copy
any
rate
he
they
do
we
ca
say
more
than
that
what
does
he
think
about
me
and
you
the
point
ten
to
one
he
in
tortures
of
doubt
and
would
give
a
fortune
to
have
five
minutes
talk
alone
with
you
to
see
how
the
land
lies
and
get
your
version
of
the
short
cut
incident
but
they
wo
let
him
they
want
to
watch
him
in
our
company
and
us
in
his
you
see
it
an
interesting
reunion
for
you
and
him
let
get
into
these
beastly
clothes
for
it
groaned
davis
shall
have
a
plunge
overboard
something
drastic
was
required
and
i
followed
his
example
curious
as
the
hour
was
for
bathing
believe
i
know
what
happened
just
now
said
i
as
we
plied
rough
towels
in
the
warmth
below
steamed
up
and
found
nobody
on
board
i
leave
a
note
says
dollmann
no
independent
communications
say
they
or
think
they
we
come
too
and
take
the
chance
of
inspecting
this
hornets
nest
down
they
go
and
dollmann
who
knows
what
to
look
for
first
sees
that
damning
bit
of
evidence
staring
him
in
the
face
they
look
casually
at
the
shelf
among
other
things
examine
the
logbook
say
and
he
manages
to
push
his
own
book
out
of
sight
but
he
could
replace
it
when
the
interruption
came
the
action
would
have
attracted
attention
and
b√∂hme
made
him
leave
the
cabin
in
advance
you
know
is
all
very
well
said
davies
pausing
in
his
toilet
do
they
guess
how
we
spent
the
day
by
jove
carruthers
that
chart
with
the
square
cut
out
there
it
is
on
the
rack
must
chance
it
and
bluff
for
all
we
worth
i
said
the
fact
was
that
davies
could
not
be
brought
to
realize
that
he
had
done
anything
very
remarkable
that
day
yet
those
fourteen
sinuous
miles
traversed
blindfold
to
say
nothing
of
the
return
journey
and
my
own
exploits
made
up
an
achievement
audacious
and
improbable
enough
to
suspicion
nevertheless
von
br√ºning
banter
had
been
disquieting
and
if
an
inkling
of
our
expedition
had
crossed
his
mind
or
theirs
there
were
ways
of
testing
us
which
it
would
require
all
our
effrontery
to
defeat
are
you
looking
for
said
davies
i
was
at
the
collar
and
stud
stage
but
had
broken
off
to
study
the
which
we
had
bought
that
morning
insists
on
coming
by
the
night
train
to
somewhere
on
the
i
reminded
him
von
br√ºning
and
grimm
are
to
meet
the
somebody
a
railway
station
i
do
know
where
they
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
but
it
must
be
somewhere
on
the
sea
because
b√∂hme
said
the
tide
serves
may
be
anywhere
from
emden
to
hamburg
see
map
b
there
a
limit
it
probably
somewhere
near
grimm
was
to
come
and
he
at
memmert
the
map
emden
and
norddeich
are
the
only
coast
stations
till
you
get
to
wilhelmshaven
no
to
carolinensiel
but
those
are
a
long
way
east
emden
a
long
way
south
say
norddeich
then
but
according
to
this
there
no
train
there
after
that
hardly
night
when
high
tide
on
the
see
here
norddeich
be
the
same
somewhere
between
and
on
the
a
train
at
emden
at
from
leer
and
the
south
and
one
at
from
the
north
you
counting
on
another
fog
said
davies
mockingly
but
i
want
to
know
what
our
plans
are
we
wait
till
this
cursed
inspection
over
we
ca
we
should
come
to
grief
this
was
no
barren
truism
for
i
was
ready
with
a
plan
of
my
own
though
reluctant
to
broach
it
to
davies
meanwhile
ready
or
not
we
had
to
start
the
cabin
we
left
as
it
was
changing
nothing
and
hiding
nothing
the
safest
course
to
take
we
thought
in
spite
of
the
risk
of
further
search
but
as
usual
i
transferred
my
diary
to
my
and
made
sure
that
the
two
official
letters
from
england
were
safe
in
a
compartment
of
it
do
you
propose
i
asked
when
we
were
in
the
dinghy
again
a
case
of
as
you
were
said
davies
trip
was
a
chance
we
shall
never
get
again
we
must
go
back
to
last
decision
tell
them
that
we
going
to
stay
on
here
for
a
bit
shooting
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
say
courting
i
suggested
they
know
all
about
that
and
then
we
must
watch
for
a
chance
of
tackling
dollmann
privately
not
because
we
want
time
to
consider
those
clues
of
yours
consider
i
said
putting
it
mildly
we
were
at
the
ladder
and
what
a
languid
stiffness
oppressed
me
i
did
not
know
till
i
touched
its
freezing
rungs
each
one
of
which
seared
my
sore
palms
like
iron
the
overdue
steamer
was
just
arriving
as
we
set
foot
on
the
quay
yet
by
jove
why
not
pursued
davies
beginning
to
stride
up
the
pier
at
a
pace
i
could
not
imitate
on
i
protested
look
here
i
disagree
altogether
i
believe
has
doubled
our
chances
but
unless
we
alter
our
tactics
it
has
doubled
our
risks
we
involved
ourselves
in
too
tangled
a
web
i
do
like
this
inspection
and
i
fear
that
foxy
old
b√∂hme
who
prompted
it
the
mere
fact
of
their
inviting
us
shows
that
we
stand
badly
for
it
runs
in
the
teeth
of
br√ºning
warning
at
bensersiel
and
smells
uncommonly
like
arrest
there
a
rift
between
dollmann
and
the
others
but
it
a
ticklish
matter
to
drive
our
wedge
in
as
to
hopeless
they
on
the
watch
and
give
us
a
chance
and
after
all
do
we
know
enough
we
do
know
why
he
fled
from
england
and
turned
german
it
may
have
been
an
extraditable
crime
but
it
may
not
supposing
he
defies
us
the
girl
you
see
she
ties
our
hands
and
if
he
once
gets
wind
of
that
and
trades
on
our
weakness
the
game
up
are
you
driving
at
want
to
detach
him
from
germany
but
he
probably
go
to
any
lengths
rather
than
abandon
his
position
here
his
attempt
on
you
is
the
measure
of
his
interest
in
it
now
is
to
be
wasted
we
were
passing
through
the
public
gardens
and
i
dropped
on
to
a
seat
for
a
moment
rest
crackling
dead
leaves
under
me
davies
remained
standing
and
pecked
at
the
gravel
with
his
toe
have
got
two
valuable
clues
i
went
on
rendezvous
on
the
is
one
and
the
name
esens
is
the
other
we
may
consider
them
to
eternity
i
vote
we
act
on
them
said
davies
under
a
searchlight
here
and
if
caught
plan
ugh
it
as
risky
as
mine
and
more
so
i
replied
rising
with
a
jerk
for
a
spasm
of
cramp
took
me
must
separate
i
added
as
we
walked
on
want
at
one
stroke
to
prove
to
them
that
we
harmless
and
to
get
a
fresh
start
i
go
back
to
london
london
said
davies
we
were
passing
under
an
arc
lamp
and
for
the
dismay
his
face
showed
i
might
have
said
kamchatka
after
all
it
where
i
ought
to
be
at
this
moment
i
observed
i
forgot
and
me
ca
get
on
without
me
so
you
lay
up
the
yacht
here
taking
your
time
you
making
inquiries
about
dollmann
past
i
double
back
as
somebody
else
and
follow
up
the
clues
have
to
be
quick
said
davies
abstractedly
can
just
do
it
in
time
for
the
you
say
making
inquiries
he
continued
looking
straight
before
him
hope
you
do
mean
setting
other
people
on
his
track
fair
game
i
could
not
help
saying
for
there
were
moments
when
i
chafed
under
this
scrupulous
fidelity
to
our
ordinance
our
game
or
nobody
said
davies
sharply
i
keep
the
secret
i
rejoined
stick
together
he
broke
out
shall
make
a
muck
of
it
without
you
and
how
are
we
to
communicate
meet
that
can
wait
i
know
it
a
leap
in
the
dark
but
safety
in
darkness
what
are
we
talking
about
if
they
have
the
ghost
of
a
notion
where
we
have
been
you
give
us
away
by
packing
off
to
london
they
think
we
know
their
secret
and
are
clearing
out
to
make
use
of
it
means
arrest
if
you
like
have
i
written
proof
of
good
faith
in
my
pocket
official
letters
of
recall
received
it
one
deception
the
less
you
see
for
those
letters
have
been
opened
skilfully
done
it
impossible
to
detect
when
in
doubt
tell
the
truth
a
rum
thing
how
often
it
pays
in
this
spying
business
said
davies
thoughtfully
we
had
been
tramping
through
deserted
streets
under
the
glare
of
electricity
i
with
my
leaden
shuffle
he
with
the
purposeful
forward
stoop
and
swinging
arms
that
always
marked
his
gait
ashore
what
it
to
be
i
said
the
schwannall√©e
do
like
it
said
he
i
trust
your
judgement
we
turned
slowly
down
running
over
a
few
last
points
where
prior
agreement
was
essential
as
we
stood
at
the
very
gate
of
the
villa
commit
yourself
to
dates
i
said
nothing
that
will
prevent
you
from
being
here
at
least
a
week
hence
with
the
yacht
still
afloat
and
my
final
word
as
we
waited
at
the
door
for
the
bell
to
be
answered
was
mind
what
say
if
things
look
queer
we
may
have
to
lighten
the
ship
whispered
davies
i
hope
i
sha
bosh
it
hope
i
sha
get
cramp
i
muttered
between
my
teeth
it
will
be
remembered
that
davies
had
never
been
to
the
villa
before
xxiv
finesse
the
door
of
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
was
opened
to
us
by
a
as
we
entered
the
rattle
of
a
piano
stopped
and
a
hot
wave
of
mingled
scent
and
struck
my
nostrils
the
first
thing
i
noticed
over
davies
shoulder
as
he
preceded
me
into
the
room
was
a
woman
the
source
of
the
perfume
i
decided
turning
round
from
the
piano
as
he
passed
it
and
staring
him
up
and
down
with
a
disdainful
familiarity
that
i
at
once
hotly
resented
she
was
in
evening
dress
pronounced
in
cut
and
colour
had
a
certain
exuberant
beauty
not
wholly
ascribable
to
nature
and
a
notable
lack
of
breeding
another
glance
showed
me
dollmann
putting
down
a
liqueur
glass
of
brandy
and
rising
from
a
low
chair
with
something
of
a
start
and
another
von
br√ºning
lying
back
in
a
corner
of
a
sofa
smoking
on
the
same
sofa
to
him
was
yes
of
course
it
was
clara
dollmann
but
how
their
surroundings
alter
people
i
caught
myself
thinking
for
the
rest
i
was
aware
that
the
room
was
furnished
with
ostentation
and
was
stuffy
with
warmth
davies
steered
a
straight
course
for
dollmann
and
shook
his
hand
with
businesslike
resolution
then
he
tacked
across
to
the
sofa
abandoning
me
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
said
dollmann
i
answered
distinctly
was
with
davies
in
the
boat
just
now
but
i
do
think
he
introduced
me
and
now
he
has
forgotten
again
i
added
dryly
turning
towards
davies
who
having
presented
himself
to
fr√§ulein
dollmann
was
looking
feebly
from
her
to
von
br√ºning
the
picture
of
awkwardness
the
commander
nodded
to
me
and
stretched
himself
with
a
yawn
br√ºning
told
me
about
you
said
dollmann
ignoring
my
allusion
i
was
not
quite
sure
of
the
name
no
it
was
not
an
occasion
for
formalities
was
it
he
gave
a
sudden
mirthless
laugh
i
thought
him
flushed
and
excitable
yet
seen
in
a
normal
light
he
was
in
some
respects
a
pleasant
surprise
the
remarkable
conformation
of
the
head
giving
an
impression
of
intellectual
power
and
restless
almost
insanely
restless
energy
need
i
said
have
heard
so
much
about
you
from
davies
and
commander
von
br√ºning
that
we
seem
to
be
old
friends
already
he
shot
a
doubtful
look
at
me
and
a
diversion
came
from
the
piano
now
for
heaven
sake
cried
the
lady
of
the
perfume
us
join
herr
b√∂hme
at
supper
me
present
you
to
my
wife
said
dollmann
so
this
was
the
stepmother
unmistakably
german
i
may
add
i
made
my
bow
and
underwent
much
the
same
sort
of
frank
scrutiny
as
davies
only
that
it
was
rather
more
favourable
to
me
and
ended
in
a
carmine
smile
there
was
a
general
movement
and
further
introductions
davies
was
led
to
the
stepmother
and
i
found
myself
confronting
the
daughter
with
quickened
pulses
and
a
sudden
sense
of
added
complexity
in
the
issues
i
had
of
course
made
up
my
mind
to
ignore
our
meeting
of
yesterday
and
had
assumed
that
she
would
do
the
same
and
she
did
ignore
it
we
met
as
utter
strangers
nor
did
i
venture
for
other
eyes
were
upon
us
to
transmit
any
sign
of
intelligence
to
her
but
the
next
moment
i
was
wondering
if
i
had
not
fallen
into
a
trap
she
had
promised
not
to
tell
but
under
what
circumstances
i
saw
the
scene
again
the
misty
flats
the
spruce
little
and
its
sweet
young
mistress
fresh
as
a
dewy
flower
but
blanched
and
demoralized
by
a
horrid
fear
appealing
to
my
honour
so
to
act
that
we
three
should
never
meet
again
promising
to
be
silent
but
as
much
in
her
own
interest
as
ours
and
under
that
implied
condition
which
i
had
only
equivocally
refused
the
condition
was
violated
not
by
her
fault
or
ours
but
violated
she
was
free
to
help
her
father
against
us
and
was
she
helping
him
what
troubled
me
was
the
change
in
her
that
she
how
can
i
express
it
without
offence
was
less
in
discord
with
her
surroundings
than
she
should
have
been
that
in
dress
pose
and
manner
as
we
exchanged
some
trivialities
she
was
too
near
reflecting
the
style
of
the
other
woman
that
in
fact
she
in
some
sort
realized
my
original
conception
of
her
so
brutally
avowed
to
davies
so
signally
as
i
had
thought
falsified
in
the
sick
perplexity
that
this
discovery
caused
me
i
dare
say
i
looked
as
foolish
as
davies
had
done
and
more
so
for
the
close
heat
of
the
room
and
its
tainted
atmosphere
succeeding
so
abruptly
to
the
wholesome
nip
of
the
outside
air
were
giving
me
a
faintness
which
this
moral
check
lessened
my
power
to
combat
von
br√ºning
face
wore
a
sneering
smile
that
i
winced
under
and
turning
i
found
another
pair
of
eyes
fixed
on
me
those
of
herr
b√∂hme
whose
squat
figure
had
appeared
at
a
pair
of
folding
doors
leading
to
an
adjoining
room
napkin
in
hand
he
was
taking
in
the
scene
before
him
with
fat
benevolence
but
exceeding
shrewdness
i
instantly
noticed
a
faint
red
weal
relieving
the
ivory
of
his
bald
head
and
i
had
suffered
too
often
in
the
same
quarter
myself
to
mistake
its
origin
namely
our
cabin
doorway
is
the
other
young
explorer
b√∂hme
said
von
br√ºning
davies
kidnapped
him
a
month
ago
and
bullied
and
starved
him
into
submission
they
drown
together
yet
i
believe
his
sufferings
have
been
terrible
sufferings
are
over
i
retorted
mutinied
deserted
have
i
davies
i
caught
davies
gazing
with
solemn
at
miss
dollmann
what
he
stammered
i
explained
in
english
yes
carruthers
has
to
go
home
he
said
in
his
vile
lingo
no
one
spoke
for
a
moment
and
even
von
br√ºning
had
no
persiflage
ready
are
we
never
going
to
have
supper
said
madame
impatiently
and
with
that
we
all
moved
towards
the
folding
doors
there
had
been
little
formality
in
the
proceedings
so
far
and
there
was
less
still
in
the
b√∂hme
resumed
his
repast
with
appetite
and
the
rest
of
us
sat
down
apparently
at
random
though
an
underlying
method
was
discernible
as
it
worked
out
dollmann
was
at
one
end
of
the
small
table
with
davies
on
his
right
and
b√∂hme
on
his
left
frau
dollmann
at
the
other
with
me
on
her
right
and
von
br√ºning
on
her
left
the
seventh
personage
fr√§ulein
dollmann
was
between
the
commander
and
davies
on
the
side
opposite
to
me
no
servants
appeared
and
we
waited
on
ourselves
i
have
a
vague
recollection
of
various
excellent
dishes
and
a
distinct
one
of
abundance
of
wine
someone
filled
me
a
glass
of
champagne
and
i
confess
that
i
drained
it
with
honest
avidity
blessing
the
craftsman
who
coaxed
forth
the
essence
the
fruit
that
harboured
it
the
sun
that
warmed
it
are
you
going
so
suddenly
said
von
br√ºning
to
me
across
the
table
i
tell
you
we
had
to
call
here
for
letters
i
got
mine
this
morning
and
among
others
a
summons
back
to
work
of
course
i
must
obey
i
found
myself
speaking
in
a
frigid
silence
annoying
thing
was
that
there
were
two
letters
and
if
i
had
only
come
here
two
days
sooner
i
should
have
only
got
the
first
which
gave
me
an
extension
are
very
conscientious
how
will
they
know
but
the
second
rather
urgent
there
was
another
uncomfortable
silence
broken
by
dollmann
the
way
herr
davies
he
began
ought
to
apologize
to
you
for
this
was
no
business
of
mine
and
the
less
interest
i
took
in
it
the
better
so
i
turned
to
frau
dollmann
and
abused
the
fog
you
been
in
the
harbour
all
day
she
asked
how
was
it
you
did
not
visit
us
was
herr
davies
so
shy
curiosity
or
malice
the
contrary
but
i
was
i
answered
coldly
see
we
knew
herr
dollmann
was
away
and
we
really
only
called
here
to
get
my
letters
besides
we
did
not
know
your
address
i
looked
at
clara
and
found
her
talking
gaily
to
von
br√ºning
deaf
seemingly
to
our
little
dialogue
would
have
told
you
it
said
madame
raising
her
eyebrows
dare
say
but
directly
after
breakfast
the
fog
came
on
and
well
one
can
not
leave
a
yacht
alone
in
a
fog
i
said
with
professional
solidity
von
br√ºning
pricked
up
his
ears
at
this
be
hanged
if
that
was
maxim
he
laughed
too
fond
of
the
shore
i
sent
him
a
glance
of
protest
as
though
to
say
the
use
of
your
warning
if
you
wo
let
me
act
on
it
for
of
course
my
excuses
were
meant
chiefly
for
his
consumption
and
fr√§ulein
dollmann
that
the
lady
i
addressed
them
to
found
them
unpalatable
was
not
my
fault
you
sat
in
your
wretched
little
cabin
all
day
she
persisted
day
i
said
brazenly
was
the
safest
thing
to
do
and
i
looked
again
at
fr√§ulein
dollmann
frankly
and
squarely
our
eyes
met
and
she
dropped
hers
instantly
but
not
before
i
had
learnt
something
for
if
ever
i
saw
misery
under
a
mask
it
was
on
her
face
no
she
had
not
told
i
think
i
puzzled
the
stepmother
who
shrugged
her
white
shoulders
and
said
in
that
case
she
wondered
we
had
dared
to
leave
our
precious
boat
and
come
to
supper
if
we
knew
frisian
fogs
as
well
as
she
did
oh
i
explained
we
were
not
so
nervous
as
that
and
as
for
supper
on
shore
if
she
only
knew
what
a
spartan
life
we
led
for
mercy
sake
do
tell
me
about
it
she
cried
with
a
grimace
hate
the
mention
of
yachts
when
i
think
of
that
dreadful
coming
from
hamburg
i
sympathized
with
half
my
attention
keeping
one
strained
ear
open
for
developments
on
my
right
davies
i
knew
was
in
the
thick
of
it
and
none
too
happy
under
b√∂hme
eye
but
working
manfully
fault
squall
safe
were
some
of
the
phrases
i
caught
while
i
was
aware
to
my
alarm
that
he
was
actually
drawing
a
diagram
of
something
with
and
the
subject
seemed
to
gutter
out
to
an
awkward
end
and
suddenly
b√∂hme
who
was
my
neighbour
turned
to
me
are
starting
for
england
morning
he
said
i
answered
is
a
steamer
at
i
believe
is
good
we
shall
be
companions
you
going
to
england
too
sir
i
asked
with
hot
misgivings
no
i
am
going
to
bremen
but
we
shall
travel
together
as
far
as
you
go
by
amsterdam
i
suppose
as
far
as
leer
then
that
will
be
very
pleasant
i
fancied
there
was
a
ghoulish
gusto
in
his
tone
i
assented
are
making
a
short
stay
here
then
long
as
usual
i
visit
the
work
at
memmert
once
a
month
or
so
spend
a
night
with
my
friend
dollmann
and
his
charming
family
he
leered
round
him
return
whether
i
was
right
or
wrong
in
my
next
step
i
shall
never
know
but
obeying
a
strong
instinct
i
said
tell
me
more
about
memmert
we
heard
a
good
deal
about
it
from
commander
von
br√ºning
but
was
discreet
i
expect
said
b√∂hme
left
off
at
the
most
interesting
part
that
about
me
joined
in
von
br√ºning
was
saying
that
we
dying
to
know
more
about
memmert
are
we
davies
i
do
know
said
davies
evidently
aghast
at
my
temerity
but
i
did
not
mind
that
if
he
roughed
my
suit
so
much
the
better
i
intended
to
rough
his
gave
us
plenty
of
history
commander
but
you
did
not
bring
it
up
to
date
the
triple
alliance
laughed
dollmann
boisterously
said
von
br√ºning
gave
you
very
good
reasons
and
you
acquiesced
now
he
is
trying
to
pump
said
b√∂hme
with
his
rasping
chuckle
a
bit
sir
i
have
an
excuse
the
commander
was
not
only
mysterious
but
inaccurate
i
appeal
to
you
herr
dollmann
for
it
was
of
you
when
we
fell
in
with
him
at
bensersiel
davies
asked
him
if
you
were
at
home
and
he
said
no
when
would
you
be
back
probably
soon
he
did
not
know
he
said
that
said
dollmann
only
three
days
later
we
arrive
at
norderney
and
find
you
have
returned
that
very
day
but
have
gone
to
memmert
again
by
the
way
the
mysterious
memmert
but
more
than
ever
mysterious
now
for
in
the
evening
not
only
you
and
herr
b√∂hme
penetration
laughed
von
br√ºning
also
commander
von
br√ºning
pay
us
a
visit
in
launch
all
coming
from
memmert
you
infer
said
von
br√ºning
that
you
must
have
known
at
bensersiel
only
three
days
ago
exactly
when
herr
dollmann
was
coming
back
having
an
appointment
at
memmert
with
him
for
i
wished
to
conceal
from
you
and
that
why
i
so
inquisitive
it
entirely
your
own
fault
it
seems
said
he
with
mock
humility
fill
your
glass
and
go
on
young
man
why
should
i
want
to
deceive
you
just
what
i
want
to
know
come
confess
now
was
there
something
important
afoot
at
memmert
something
to
do
with
the
gold
you
were
inspecting
it
sorting
it
weighing
it
or
know
you
were
transporting
it
secretly
to
the
mainland
a
very
good
day
for
that
but
softly
herr
carruthers
no
fishing
for
admissions
who
said
we
had
found
any
gold
have
you
there
better
nothing
like
candour
my
young
investigator
but
i
am
afraid
having
no
authority
i
can
not
assist
you
at
all
better
try
herr
b√∂hme
again
i
only
a
casual
onlooker
shares
you
remember
that
he
remembers
everything
with
a
few
shares
then
but
with
no
expert
knowledge
now
b√∂hme
is
the
consulting
engineer
rescue
me
b√∂hme
can
not
disclaim
expert
knowledge
said
b√∂hme
with
humorous
gravity
i
disclaim
responsibility
now
herr
dollmann
is
chairman
of
the
company
i
said
dollmann
with
a
noisy
laugh
fall
back
on
the
shareholders
whose
interests
i
have
to
guard
one
ca
be
too
careful
in
these
confidential
matters
one
who
gives
his
consent
i
said
he
represent
the
rest
by
torture
said
von
br√ºning
retract
mind
them
herr
carruthers
cried
frau
dollmann
are
making
fun
of
you
but
i
will
give
you
a
hint
no
woman
can
keep
a
secret
i
cried
triumphantly
have
been
there
not
i
i
detest
the
sea
but
clara
has
everyone
looked
at
clara
who
in
her
turn
looked
in
na√Øve
bewilderment
from
me
to
her
father
i
said
more
soberly
perhaps
she
is
not
a
free
agent
free
said
dollmann
have
only
been
there
once
some
time
ago
said
she
i
saw
no
gold
at
all
i
observed
beg
your
pardon
i
mean
that
perhaps
you
only
saw
what
you
were
allowed
to
see
and
in
any
case
the
fr√§ulein
has
no
expert
knowledge
and
no
responsibility
and
perhaps
no
shares
her
province
is
to
be
charming
not
to
hold
financial
secrets
have
done
my
best
to
help
you
said
the
stepmother
all
against
us
davies
chuck
it
carruthers
said
davies
in
english
insatiable
said
von
br√ºning
and
there
was
a
pause
clearly
they
meant
to
elicit
more
i
shall
draw
my
own
conclusions
i
said
is
interesting
said
von
br√ºning
what
sense
begins
to
dawn
on
me
that
you
made
fools
of
us
at
bensersiel
do
you
remember
davies
what
an
interest
he
took
in
all
our
doings
i
wonder
if
he
feared
our
exploring
propensities
might
possibly
lead
us
to
memmert
my
word
this
is
the
blackest
ingratitude
i
thought
i
made
myself
particularly
agreeable
to
you
indeed
especially
about
the
duck
shooting
how
useful
your
local
man
would
have
been
both
to
us
and
to
you
on
said
the
commander
imperturbably
a
moment
i
thinking
it
out
and
thinking
it
out
i
was
in
deadly
earnest
for
all
my
levity
as
i
pressed
my
hand
on
my
burning
forehead
and
asked
myself
where
i
was
to
stop
in
this
seductive
but
perilous
fraud
to
carry
it
too
far
was
to
court
complete
exposure
to
stop
too
soon
was
equally
compromising
is
he
talking
about
and
why
go
on
with
this
ridiculous
mystery
said
frau
dollmann
was
thinking
about
this
supper
party
and
the
way
it
came
about
i
pursued
slowly
to
complain
of
i
hope
said
dollmann
course
not
impromptu
parties
are
always
the
pleasantest
and
this
one
was
delightfully
impromptu
now
i
bet
you
i
know
its
origin
did
you
discuss
us
at
memmert
and
did
one
of
you
suggest
would
almost
think
you
had
been
there
said
dollmann
may
thank
your
vile
climate
that
we
were
i
retorted
laughing
as
i
was
saying
did
one
of
you
suggest
which
of
you
well
i
sure
it
was
the
commander
not
said
b√∂hme
difficult
to
explain
an
intuition
say
i
am
sure
he
stood
up
for
us
and
i
do
think
it
was
herr
dollmann
because
he
knows
davies
already
and
he
always
on
the
spot
and
in
short
i
swear
it
was
herr
b√∂hme
who
is
leaving
early
and
had
never
seen
either
of
us
it
was
you
sir
who
proposed
that
we
should
be
asked
to
supper
for
inspection
said
b√∂hme
an
extraordinary
idea
ca
deny
it
though
and
one
thing
more
in
the
harbour
just
now
no
this
is
going
too
far
i
shall
mortally
offend
you
i
gave
way
to
hearty
laughter
let
have
it
your
hallucinations
are
diverting
you
insist
but
this
is
rather
a
delicate
matter
you
know
we
were
a
little
surprised
to
find
you
on
board
and
you
herr
b√∂hme
did
you
always
take
such
a
deep
interest
in
small
yachts
i
am
afraid
that
it
was
at
a
certain
sacrifice
of
comfort
that
you
ours
and
i
glanced
at
the
token
he
bore
of
his
encounter
with
our
lintel
there
was
a
burst
of
merriment
in
which
dollmann
took
the
loudest
share
warned
you
b√∂hme
he
said
the
engineer
took
the
joke
in
the
best
possible
part
owe
you
apologies
he
conceded
mention
it
said
davies
does
mind
i
said
the
injured
one
i
sure
you
never
suspected
davies
who
could
who
indeed
i
was
on
firm
ground
there
point
is
what
did
you
take
for
we
take
you
for
it
still
said
von
br√ºning
still
suspicious
do
drive
me
to
extremities
extremities
i
get
back
to
london
i
shall
go
to
lloyd
i
have
forgotten
that
flaw
in
the
title
there
was
an
impressive
silence
said
dollmann
with
exaggerated
solemnity
must
come
to
terms
with
this
formidable
young
man
what
do
you
say
me
to
memmert
i
exclaimed
are
my
terms
you
to
memmert
but
i
thought
you
were
starting
for
england
ought
to
but
i
stay
for
that
said
it
was
urgent
your
conscience
is
very
elastic
my
affair
will
you
take
me
to
memmert
do
you
say
gentlemen
b√∂hme
nodded
think
we
owe
some
reparation
under
promise
of
absolute
secrecy
then
course
now
that
you
trust
me
but
you
show
me
everything
honour
bright
wreck
dep√¥t
and
all
if
you
do
object
to
a
diver
dress
i
cried
in
triumph
won
our
point
davies
and
now
gentlemen
i
do
mind
saying
that
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
joke
at
an
end
and
in
spite
of
your
kind
offer
i
must
start
for
england
under
the
good
herr
b√∂hme
wing
and
in
case
my
elastic
conscience
troubles
you
for
i
see
you
think
me
a
here
are
the
letters
received
this
morning
establishing
my
identity
as
a
humble
but
respectable
clerk
in
the
british
civil
service
summoned
away
from
his
holiday
by
a
tyrannical
superior
i
pulled
out
my
letters
and
tossed
them
to
dollmann
you
do
read
english
easily
perhaps
i
dare
say
herr
b√∂hme
does
leaving
b√∂hme
to
study
dates
postmarks
and
contents
to
his
content
and
unobserved
i
turned
to
sympathize
with
my
fair
neighbour
who
complained
that
her
head
was
going
round
and
no
wonder
but
at
this
juncture
and
very
much
to
my
surprise
davies
struck
in
should
like
to
go
to
memmert
he
said
said
von
br√ºning
i
surprised
at
that
you
wo
be
staying
here
either
davies
i
objected
i
shall
said
davies
i
told
you
i
should
if
you
leave
me
in
the
lurch
like
this
i
must
have
time
to
look
round
need
pretend
that
you
can
not
sail
alone
said
von
br√ºning
much
more
fun
with
two
i
think
i
shall
wire
for
another
friend
meanwhile
i
should
like
to
see
memmert
only
an
excuse
i
afraid
said
i
want
to
shoot
ducks
too
pursued
davies
reddening
always
have
wanted
to
and
you
promised
to
help
in
that
commander
ca
get
out
of
it
now
i
laughed
not
said
he
unmoved
honestly
i
should
advise
herr
davies
if
he
is
ever
going
to
get
home
this
season
to
make
the
best
of
this
fine
weather
too
fine
said
davies
prefer
wind
if
i
can
not
get
a
friend
i
think
i
shall
stop
cruising
leave
the
yacht
here
and
come
back
for
her
next
year
there
was
some
mute
telegraphy
between
the
allies
can
leave
her
in
my
charge
said
dollmann
start
with
your
friend
but
there
is
no
hurry
said
davies
growing
redder
than
ever
like
norderney
and
we
might
have
another
sail
in
your
dinghy
fr√§ulein
he
blurted
out
you
she
said
in
that
low
dry
voice
i
had
heard
yesterday
i
think
i
shall
not
be
sailing
again
it
is
getting
too
cold
no
said
davies
splendid
but
she
had
turned
to
von
br√ºning
and
took
no
notice
send
me
a
report
about
memmert
davies
i
laughed
with
the
idea
of
drawing
attention
from
his
rebuff
but
davies
having
once
delivered
his
soul
seemed
to
have
lost
his
shyness
and
only
gazed
at
his
neighbour
with
the
placid
dogged
expression
that
i
knew
so
well
that
was
the
end
of
those
delicate
topics
and
conviviality
grew
apace
i
am
not
indifferent
at
any
time
to
good
wine
and
good
cheer
nor
was
it
for
lack
of
pressing
that
i
drank
as
sparingly
as
i
was
able
and
pretended
to
a
greater
elation
than
i
felt
nor
certainly
was
it
from
any
fine
scruples
as
to
the
character
of
the
gentleman
whose
hospitality
we
were
receiving
scruples
which
i
knew
affected
davies
who
ate
little
and
drank
nothing
in
any
case
he
was
adamant
in
such
matters
and
i
verily
believe
would
at
any
time
have
preferred
our
own
little
messes
to
the
best
dinner
in
the
world
it
was
a
very
wholesome
caution
that
warned
me
not
to
abuse
the
finest
brain
tonic
ever
invented
by
the
wit
of
man
i
had
finessed
memmert
as
one
finesses
a
low
card
when
holding
a
higher
but
i
had
too
much
respect
for
our
adversaries
to
trade
on
any
fancied
security
we
had
won
thereby
they
had
allowed
me
to
win
the
trick
but
i
credited
them
with
a
better
knowledge
of
my
hand
than
they
chose
to
show
on
the
other
hand
i
hugged
the
axiom
that
in
all
conflicts
it
is
just
as
fatal
to
underrate
the
difficulties
of
your
enemy
as
to
overrate
your
own
their
chief
one
and
it
multiplied
a
thousandfold
the
excitement
of
the
contest
was
i
felt
sure
the
fear
of
striking
in
error
of
using
a
to
break
a
nut
in
breaking
it
they
risked
publicity
and
publicity
i
felt
convinced
was
death
to
their
secret
so
even
supposing
they
had
detected
the
finesse
and
guessed
that
we
had
in
fact
got
wind
of
imperial
designs
yet
even
so
i
counted
on
immunity
so
long
as
they
thought
we
were
on
the
wrong
scent
with
memmert
and
memmert
alone
as
the
source
of
our
suspicions
had
it
been
necessary
i
was
prepared
to
encourage
such
a
view
admitting
that
the
cloth
von
br√ºning
wore
had
made
his
connexion
with
memmert
curious
and
had
suggested
to
davies
for
i
should
have
put
it
on
him
with
his
naval
enthusiasms
that
the
were
really
works
if
they
went
farther
and
suspected
that
we
had
tried
to
go
to
memmert
that
very
day
the
position
was
worse
but
not
desperate
for
the
fear
that
they
would
take
the
final
step
and
suppose
that
we
had
actually
got
there
and
overheard
their
talk
i
flatly
refused
to
entertain
until
i
should
find
myself
under
arrest
precisely
how
near
we
came
to
it
i
shall
never
rightly
know
but
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
we
trembled
on
the
verge
the
main
issue
was
fully
enough
for
me
and
it
was
only
in
passing
flashes
that
i
followed
the
play
of
the
warring
and
yet
looking
back
on
the
scene
i
would
warrant
there
was
no
party
of
seven
in
europe
that
evening
where
a
student
of
human
documents
would
have
found
so
rich
a
field
such
noble
and
ignoble
ambitions
such
base
and
holy
fears
aye
and
such
pitiful
agonies
of
the
spirit
roughly
divided
though
we
were
into
separate
camps
no
two
of
us
were
wholly
at
one
each
wore
a
mask
in
the
grand
imposture
excepting
i
am
inclined
to
think
the
lady
on
my
left
who
outside
her
own
which
she
cultivated
without
reserve
had
as
far
as
i
could
see
but
one
axe
to
grind
the
intimacy
of
von
br√ºning
and
her
stepdaughter
and
ground
it
openly
not
even
b√∂hme
and
von
br√ºning
were
wholly
at
one
and
as
moral
distances
are
reckoned
davies
and
i
were
leagues
apart
sitting
between
dollmann
and
dollmann
daughter
the
living
and
breathing
symbols
of
the
two
polar
passions
he
had
sworn
to
harmonize
he
kept
an
equilibrium
which
though
his
aims
were
nominally
mine
i
could
not
attain
to
for
me
the
man
was
the
central
figure
if
i
had
attention
to
spare
it
was
on
him
that
i
bestowed
it
groping
disgustfully
after
his
hidden
springs
of
action
noting
the
evidences
of
great
gifts
squandered
and
prostituted
questioning
where
he
was
most
vulnerable
whom
he
feared
most
us
or
his
colleagues
whether
he
was
open
to
remorse
or
shame
or
whether
he
meditated
further
crime
the
girl
was
incidental
after
the
first
shock
of
surprise
i
had
soon
enough
discovered
that
she
like
the
rest
had
assumed
a
disguise
for
she
was
far
too
innocent
to
sustain
the
deception
and
yesterday
was
fresh
in
my
memory
i
was
forced
to
continue
turning
her
assumed
character
to
account
but
it
would
be
pharisaical
in
me
to
say
that
i
rose
to
any
moral
heights
in
her
regard
wine
and
excitement
had
deadened
my
better
nature
to
that
extent
i
thought
she
looked
prettier
than
ever
and
as
time
passed
i
fell
into
a
cynical
carelessness
about
her
this
glimpse
of
her
home
life
and
the
desperate
expedients
to
which
she
was
driven
whether
by
compulsion
or
from
her
own
regard
for
davies
to
repel
and
dismiss
him
did
not
strike
me
as
they
might
have
done
as
the
crowning
argument
in
favour
of
the
course
we
had
adopted
the
night
before
that
of
compassing
our
end
without
noise
and
scandal
disarming
dollmann
but
aiding
him
to
escape
from
the
allies
he
had
betrayed
to
davies
the
man
if
not
a
pure
abstraction
was
at
most
a
noxious
vermin
to
be
trampled
on
for
the
public
good
while
the
girl
in
her
blackguardly
surroundings
and
with
her
sinister
future
had
become
the
very
source
of
his
impulse
and
the
other
players
b√∂hme
was
abstraction
the
fortress
whose
foundations
we
were
sapping
the
embodiment
of
that
systematized
force
which
is
congenital
to
the
german
people
in
von
br√ºning
the
personal
factor
was
uppermost
callous
as
i
was
this
evening
i
could
not
help
wondering
occasionally
as
he
talked
and
laughed
with
clara
dollmann
what
in
his
innermost
thoughts
knowing
her
father
he
felt
and
meant
it
is
a
point
i
can
not
and
would
not
pursue
and
thank
heaven
it
does
not
matter
now
yet
with
fuller
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
i
trust
a
mellower
judgement
i
often
return
to
the
same
debate
and
by
i
know
not
what
illogical
bypaths
always
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion
that
i
liked
the
man
and
like
him
still
we
behaved
as
sportsmen
in
the
matter
of
time
giving
them
over
two
hours
to
make
up
their
minds
about
us
it
was
only
when
and
heat
brought
back
my
faintness
and
a
twinge
of
cramp
warned
me
that
human
strength
has
limits
that
i
rose
and
said
we
must
go
that
i
had
to
make
an
early
start
i
am
hazy
about
the
farewells
but
i
think
that
dollmann
was
the
most
cordial
to
me
at
any
rate
and
i
augured
good
therefrom
b√∂hme
said
he
should
see
me
again
von
br√ºning
though
bound
for
the
harbour
also
considered
it
was
far
too
early
to
be
going
yet
and
said
want
to
talk
us
over
i
remember
saying
with
the
last
flicker
of
gaiety
i
could
muster
we
were
in
the
streets
again
under
a
silver
breathless
night
dizzily
footing
the
greasy
ladder
again
in
the
cabin
again
where
i
collapsed
on
a
sofa
just
as
i
was
and
slept
such
a
deep
and
stringent
sleep
that
the
men
of
the
launch
might
have
handcuffed
and
trussed
and
carried
me
away
without
incommoding
me
in
the
least
xxv
i
double
back
old
chap
called
davies
the
whistle
blew
and
the
forged
ahead
leaving
davies
on
the
quay
bareheaded
and
wearing
his
old
norfolk
jacket
and
stained
grey
flannels
as
at
our
first
meeting
in
flensburg
station
there
was
no
bandaged
hand
this
time
but
he
looked
pinched
and
depressed
his
eyes
had
black
circles
round
them
and
again
i
felt
that
same
indefinable
pathos
in
him
friend
is
in
low
spirits
said
b√∂hme
who
was
installed
on
a
seat
beside
me
voluminously
caped
and
rugged
against
the
biting
air
it
was
a
still
sunless
day
am
i
i
grunted
and
it
was
the
literal
truth
i
was
only
half
awake
felt
unwashed
and
dissipated
heavy
in
head
and
limbs
but
for
davies
i
should
never
have
been
where
i
was
it
was
he
who
had
patiently
coaxed
me
out
of
my
bunk
packed
my
bag
fed
me
with
tea
and
an
omelette
to
which
i
believe
he
had
devoted
peculiarly
tender
care
and
generally
mothered
me
for
departure
while
i
swallowed
my
second
cup
he
was
brushing
the
mould
and
smoothing
the
dents
from
my
felt
hat
which
had
been
entombed
for
a
month
in
the
working
at
it
with
a
remorseful
concern
in
his
face
the
only
initiative
i
am
conscious
of
having
shown
was
in
the
matter
of
my
bag
in
my
sea
clothes
oils
and
all
i
had
said
may
want
them
again
there
was
mortal
need
of
a
thorough
consultation
but
this
was
out
of
the
question
davies
did
not
badger
or
complain
but
only
timidly
asked
me
how
we
were
to
meet
and
communicate
a
question
on
which
my
mind
was
an
absolute
blank
out
for
me
about
the
i
suggested
feebly
before
we
left
the
cabin
he
gave

the

was
full
and
the

blank
for
miles
round
till
they
merged
in

soon
i
drifted
down
into
the
saloon
and
crouching
over
a

pulled
out
that
scrap
of
paper
in
a
crabbed

i
nodded
stupidly
over
this
document
so
stupidly
that
i
found
myself
wondering
whether
burmer
was
a
place
or
a
person
then
i
dozed
to
wake
with
a
violent
start
and
find
the
paper
on
the
floor
i
hid
it
away
and
went
on
deck
when
i
found
we
were
close
to
norddeich
running
up
to
the
bleakest
of
bleak
jetties
thrown
out
from
the
polders
of
the
mainland
b√∂hme
and
i
landed
together
and
he
was
at
my
elbow
as
i
asked
for
a
ticket
for
amsterdam
and
was
given
one
as
far
as
rheine
a
junction
near
the
dutch
frontier
he
was
ensconced
in
an
opposite
corner
to
me
in
the
railway
carriage
looking
like
an
indian
idol
do
you
come
in
i
pondered
dreamily
too
sleepy
to
talk
i
could
only
blink
at
him
sitting
bolt
upright
with
my
arms
folded
over
my
precious
finally
i
gave
up
the
struggle
buttoned
my
ulster
tightly
up
and
turning
my
back
upon
him
with
an
apology
lay
down
to
sleep
the
precious
pocket
nethermost
he
was
at
liberty
to
rifle
my
bag
if
he
chose
and
i
dare
say
he
did
i
can
not
say
for
from
this
point
till
rheine
for
the
best
part
of
four
hours
that
is
i
had
only
two
lucid
intervals
the
first
was
at
emden
where
we
both
had
to
change
here
as
we
pushed
our
way
down
the
crowded
platform
b√∂hme
after
being
greeted
respectfully
by
several
persons
was
at
last
buttonholed
without
means
of
escape
by
an
obsequious
gentleman
whose
description
is
of
no
moment
but
whose
conversation
is
it
was
about
a
canal
what
canal
i
did
not
gather
though
from
a
name
dropped
i
afterwards
identified
it
as
one
in
course
of
construction
as
a
feeder
to
the
ems
the
point
is
that
the
subject
was
canals
at
the
moment
it
was
seed
dropped
in
unreceptive
soil
but
it
germinated
later
i
passed
on
mingling
with
the
crowd
and
was
soon
asleep
again
in
another
carriage
where
b√∂hme
this
time
did
not
follow
me
the
second
occasion
was
at
leer
where
i
heard
myself
called
by
name
and
woke
to
find
him
at
the
window
he
had
to
change
trains
and
had
come
to
say
forget
to
go
to
lloyd
he
grated
in
my
ear
i
expect
it
was
a
wan
smile
that
i
returned
for
i
was
at
a
very
low
ebb
and
my
fortress
looked
sarcastically
impregnable
but
the
sapper
was
free
was
my
last
conscious
thought
even
after
rheine
where
i
changed
for
the
last
time
a
brutish
drowsiness
enchained
me
and
the
afternoon
was
well
advanced
before
my
faculties
began
to
revive
the
train
crept
like
a
snail
from
station
to
station
i
might
so
a
told
me
have
waited
three
hours
at
rheine
for
an
express
which
would
have
brought
me
to
amsterdam
at
about
the
same
time
or
if
i
had
chosen
to
break
the
journey
farther
back
two
hours
at
either
emden
or
leer
would
still
have
enabled
me
to
catch
the
said
express
at
rheine
these
alternatives
had
escaped
davies
and
i
surmised
had
been
suppressed
by
b√∂hme
who
doubtless
did
not
want
me
behind
him
free
either
to
double
back
or
to
follow
him
to
bremen
the
pace
then
was
execrable
and
there
were
delays
we
were
behind
time
at
hengelo
thirty
minutes
late
at
apeldoorn
so
that
i
might
well
have
grown
nervous
about
my
connexions
at
amsterdam
which
were
in
some
jeopardy
but
as
i
battled
out
of
my
lethargy
and
began
to
take
account
of
our
position
and
prospects
quite
a
different
thought
at
the
outset
affected
me
anxiety
to
reach
london
was
swamped
in
reluctance
to
quit
germany
so
that
i
found
myself
grudging
every
mile
that
i
placed
between
me
and
the
frontier
it
was
the
old
question
of
urgency
was
the
the
visit
to
london
meant
a
minimum
absence
of
hours
counting
from
amsterdam
that
is
to
say
that
by
travelling
for
two
nights
and
one
day
and
devoting
the
other
day
to
investigating
dollmann
past
it
was
humanly
possible
for
me
to
be
back
on
the
frisian
coast
on
the
evening
of
the
yes
i
could
be
at
norden
if
that
was
the
at
but
what
a
scramble
no
margin
for
delays
no
physical
respite
some
pasts
take
a
deal
of
raking
up
other
persons
may
be
affected
men
are
cautious
they
trip
you
up
with
red
tape
or
the
man
who
knows
is
out
at
lunch
a
protracted
lunch
or
in
the
country
a
protracted
will
you
see
mr
or
leave
a
note
oh
i
know
those
public
departments
from
the
inside
and
the
admiralty
i
saw
myself
baffled
and
racing
back
the
same
night
to
germany
with
two
days
wasted
arriving
good
for
nothing
at
norden
with
no
leisure
to
reconnoitre
my
ground
to
be
baffled
again
there
probably
for
you
can
not
always
count
on
fogs
as
davies
said
esens
was
another
clue
and
follow
burmer
there
was
something
in
that
notion
but
i
wanted
time
and
had
i
time
how
long
could
davies
maintain
himself
at
norderney
not
so
very
long
from
what
i
remembered
of
last
night
and
was
he
even
safe
there
a
feverish
dream
recurred
to
me
a
dream
of
davies
in
a
of
a
regrettable
hitch
in
the
stop
that
was
nonsense
let
us
be
sane
what
matter
if
he
had
to
go
what
matter
if
i
took
my
time
in
london
then
with
a
flood
of
shame
i
saw
davies
wistful
face
on
the
quay
heard
his
grim
ejaculation
our
game
or
no
one
and
my
own
sullen
i
keep
the
secret
london
was
utterly
impossible
if
i
found
my
informant
what
credentials
had
i
what
claim
to
confidences
none
unless
i
told
the
whole
story
why
my
mere
presence
in
whitehall
would
imperil
the
secret
for
once
on
my
native
heath
i
should
be
recognized
possibly
haled
to
judgement
at
the
best
should
escape
in
a
cloud
of
rumour
heard
of
at
norderney
this
morning
was
raising
cain
at
the
admiralty
about
a
mythical
lieutenant
no
back
to
friesland
was
the
word
one
night
rest
i
must
have
that
between
sheets
on
a
feather
bed
one
long
luxurious
night
and
then
back
refreshed
to
friesland
to
finish
our
work
in
our
own
way
and
with
none
but
our
own
weapons
having
reached
this
resolve
i
was
nearly
putting
it
into
instant
execution
by
alighting
at
amersfoort
but
thought
better
of
it
i
had
a
transformation
to
effect
before
i
returned
north
and
the
more
populous
centre
i
made
it
in
the
less
it
was
likely
to
attract
notice
besides
i
had
in
my
mind
eye
a
perfect
bed
in
a
perfect
hostelry
hard
by
the
amstel
river
it
was
an
economy
in
the
end
so
at
eight
i
was
sipping
my
coffee
in
the
aforesaid
hostelry
with
a
london
newspaper
before
me
which
was
unusually
interesting
and
some
german
journals
which
hate
of
a
wrong
not
theirs
were
one
and
all
seething
with
rancorous
anglophobia
at
nine
i
was
in
the
jewish
quarter
striking
bargains
in
an
infamous
marine
at
nine
i
was
despatching
this
unscrupulous
telegram
to
my
chief
sorry
could
not
call
norderney
hope
extension
all
right
please
write
to
h√¥tel
du
louvre
paris
at
ten
i
was
in
the
perfect
bed
rapturously
flinging
my
limbs
abroad
in
its
glorious
redundancies
and
at
on
the
following
morning
with
a
novel
chilliness
about
the
upper
lip
and
a
vast
excess
of
strength
and
spirits
i
was
sitting
in
a
carriage
bound
for
germany
and
dressed
as
a
young
seaman
in
a
peaked
cap
and
comforter
the
transition
had
not
been
difficult
i
had
shaved
off
my
moustache
and
breakfasted
hastily
in
my
bedroom
ready
equipped
for
a
journey
in
my
ulster
and
cloth
cap
i
had
dismissed
the
hotel
porter
at
the
station
and
left
my
bag
at
the
after
taking
out
of
it
an
umber
bundle
and
substituting
the
ulster
the
umber
bundle
which
consisted
of
my
oilskins
and
within
them
my
and
a
few
other
garments
and
necessaries
the
whole
tied
up
with
a
length
of
tarry
rope
was
now
in
the
rack
above
me
and
with
a
stout
stick
represented
my
luggage
every
article
in
it
i
shudder
at
their
origin
was
in
strict
keeping
with
my
humble
for
i
knew
they
were
liable
to
search
at
the
frontier
but
there
was
a
baedeker
of
northern
germany
in
my
jacket
pocket
for
the
nonce
if
questions
were
asked
i
was
an
english
seaman
going
to
emden
to
join
a
ship
with
a
ticket
as
far
as
the
frontier
beyond
that
a
definite
scheme
of
action
had
still
to
be
thought
out
one
thing
however
was
sure
i
was
determined
to
be
at
norden
night
the
a
word
about
norden
which
is
a
small
town
seven
miles
south
of
norddeich
when
hurriedly
scanning
the
map
for
coast
stations
in
the
cabin
yesterday
i
had
not
thought
of
norden
because
it
did
not
appear
to
be
on
the
coast
but
davies
had
noticed
it
while
i
slept
and
i
now
saw
that
his
pencilled
hint
was
a
shrewd
one
the
creek
he
spoke
of
though
barely
visible
on
the
map
see
map
b
flowed
into
the
ems
estuary
in
a
direction
the
train
tallied
to
perfection
for
high
tide
in
the
creek
would
be
as
davies
estimated
between
and
on
the
night
of
the
and
the
showed
that
the
only
night
train
arriving
at
norden
was
one
from
the
south
at
this
looked
promising
emden
which
i
had
inclined
to
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
was
out
of
court
in
comparison
for
many
reasons
not
the
least
being
that
it
was
served
by
three
trains
between
and
so
that
the
phrase
train
would
be
ambiguous
and
not
decisive
as
with
norden
so
far
good
but
how
was
i
to
spend
the
intervening
time
should
i
act
on
davies
and
go
to
bremen
after
b√∂hme
i
soon
dismissed
that
idea
it
was
one
to
act
upon
if
others
failed
for
the
present
it
meant
another
scramble
bremen
is
six
hours
from
norden
by
rail
i
should
spend
a
disproportionate
amount
of
my
limited
time
in
trains
and
i
should
want
a
different
disguise
besides
i
had
already
learnt
something
fresh
about
b√∂hme
for
the
seed
dropped
at
emden
station
yesterday
had
come
to
life
a
submarine
engineer
i
knew
him
to
be
before
i
now
knew
that
canals
were
another
branch
of
his
labours
not
a
very
illuminating
fact
but
could
i
pick
up
more
in
a
single
day
there
remained
esens
and
it
was
thither
i
resolved
to
go
a
tedious
journey
lasting
till
past
eight
in
the
evening
but
there
i
should
only
be
an
hour
from
norden
by
rail
and
at
esens
all
day
long
i
strove
for
light
on
the
central
mystery
collecting
from
my
diary
my
memory
my
imagination
from
the
map
the
and
davies
grubby
jottings
every
elusive
atom
of
material
sometimes
i
issued
from
a
reverie
with
a
start
to
find
a
phlegmatic
dutch
peasant
staring
strangely
at
me
over
his
china
pipe
i
was
more
careful
over
the
german
border
davies
paper
i
soon
knew
by
heart
i
pictured
him
writing
it
with
his
cramped
fist
in
his
corner
by
the
stove
fighting
against
sleep
absently
striking
salvos
of
matches
while
i
snored
in
my
bunk
absently
diverging
into
dreams
i
knew
of
a
face
under
dewy
hair
and
a
grey
though
not
a
word
of
her
came
into
the
document
i
smiled
to
see
his
undying
faith
in
the
theory
reconciled
at
the
eleventh
hour
with
new
data
touching
the
neglected
the
result
was
certainly
interesting
but
it
left
me
cold
that
there
existed
in
the
german
archives
some
such
scheme
of
defence
for
the
north
sea
coast
was
very
likely
indeed
the
seven
islands
with
their
seven
shallow
channels
though
by
the
way
two
of
them
the
twin
branches
of
the
ems
are
by
no
means
so
shallow
were
a
very
fair
conjecture
and
fitted
in
admirably
with
the
channel
theory
whose
intrinsic
merits
i
had
always
recognized
my
constant
objection
having
been
that
it
did
not
go
nearly
far
enough
to
account
for
our
treatment
the
ring
of
railway
round
the
peninsula
with
esens
at
the
apex
was
suggestive
too
but
the
same
objection
applied
every
country
with
a
maritime
frontier
has
i
suppose
secret
plans
of
mobilization
for
its
defence
but
they
are
not
such
as
could
be
discovered
by
passing
travellers
not
such
as
would
warrant
stealthy
searches
or
require
for
their
elaboration
so
recondite
a
as
memmert
dollmann
was
another
weak
point
dollmann
in
england
spying
all
countries
germany
included
have
spies
in
their
service
dirty
though
necessary
tools
but
dollmann
in
such
intimate
association
with
the
principal
plotters
on
this
side
dollmann
rich
influential
a
power
in
local
affairs
it
was
clear
he
was
no
ordinary
spy
and
here
i
detected
a
hesitation
in
davies
rough
sketch
a
reluctance
as
it
were
to
pursue
a
clue
to
its
logical
end
he
spoke
of
a
german
scheme
of
coast
defence
and
in
the
next
breath
of
dollmann
spying
for
english
plans
in
the
event
of
war
with
germany
and
there
he
left
the
matter
but
what
sort
of
plans
obviously
if
he
was
on
the
right
track
plans
of
attack
on
the
german
coast
as
opposed
to
those
of
strategy
on
the
high
seas
but
what
sort
of
an
attack
obviously
again
if
his
meant
anything
an
attack
by
invasion
on
that
remote
and
desolate
littoral
which
he
had
so
often
himself
declared
to
be
impregnably
secure
behind
its
web
of
sands
and
shallows
my
mind
went
back
to
my
question
at
bensersiel
this
coast
be
invaded
to
his
denial
and
our
fruitless
survey
of
the
dykes
and
polders
was
he
now
reverting
to
a
fancy
we
had
both
rejected
while
shrinking
from
giving
it
explicit
utterance
the
doubt
was
tantalizing
a
brief
digression
here
about
the
phases
of
my
journey
at
rheine
i
changed
trains
turned
due
north
and
became
a
german
seaman
there
was
little
risk
in
a
defective
accent
sailors
are
so
polyglot
while
an
english
sailor
straying
about
esens
might
excite
curiosity
yesterday
i
had
paid
no
heed
to
the
landscape
i
neglected
nothing
that
could
conceivably
supply
a
hint
from
rheine
to
emden
we
descended
the
valley
of
the
ems
at
first
through
a
land
of
thriving
towns
and
fat
pastures
degenerating
farther
north
to
spaces
of
heathery
bog
and
moorland
a
sad
country
but
looking
at
its
best
such
as
that
was
for
i
should
mention
here
that
the
weather
which
in
the
early
morning
had
been
as
cold
and
misty
as
ever
grew
steadily
milder
and
brighter
as
the
day
advanced
while
my
newspaper
stated
that
the
glass
was
falling
and
the
anticyclone
giving
way
to
pressure
from
the
atlantic
at
emden
where
we
entered
friesland
proper
the
train
crossed
a
big
canal
and
for
the
twentieth
time
that
day
for
we
had
passed
numbers
of
them
in
holland
and
not
a
few
in
germany
i
said
to
myself
canals
where
does
b√∂hme
come
in
it
was
dusk
but
light
enough
to
see
an
unfamiliar
craft
a
in
fact
moored
to
stakes
at
one
side
in
a
moment
i
remembered
that
page
in
the
sea
where
the
canal
is
referred
to
as
deep
enough
to
carry
and
as
used
for
that
strategic
purpose
between
wilhelmshaven
and
emden
along
the
base
that
is
of
the
frisian
peninsula
i
asked
a
peasant
opposite
yes
that
was
the
canal
had
davies
forgotten
it
it
would
have
greatly
strengthened
his
halting
sketch
at
the
bookstall
at
emden
i
bought
a
pocket
ordnance
map
there
is
of
course
no
space
to
reproduce
this
but
here
and
henceforward
the
reader
is
referred
to
map
b
of
friesland
on
a
much
larger
scale
than
anything
i
had
used
before
and
when
i
was
unobserved
studied
the
course
of
the
canal
with
an
impatience
which
alas
quickly
cooled
from
emden
northwards
i
used
the
same
map
to
aid
my
eyesight
and
with
its
help
saw
in
the
gathering
gloom
more
heaths
and
bogs
once
a
great
glimmering
lake
and
at
intervals
cultivated
tracts
a
watery
land
as
ever
pools
streams
and
countless
drains
and
ditches
extensive
woods
were
marked
also
but
farther
inland
we
passed
norden
at
seven
just
dark
i
looked
out
for
the
creek
and
sure
enough
we
crossed
it
just
before
entering
the
station
its
bed
was
nearly
dry
and
i
distinguished
barges
lying
aground
in
it
this
being
the
junction
for
esens
i
had
to
wait
of
an
hour
and
then
turned
east
through
the
uttermost
northern
wilds
stopping
at
occasional
village
stations
and
keeping
five
or
six
miles
from
the
sea
it
was
during
this
stage
in
a
wretchedly
lit
compartment
and
alone
for
the
most
part
that
i
finally
assembled
all
my
threads
and
tried
to
weave
them
into
a
cable
whose
core
should
be
esens
town
so
baedeker
said
inhabitants
the
centre
of
a
rich
agricultural
district
fine
spire
esens
is
four
miles
inland
from
bensersiel
i
reviewed
every
circumstance
of
that
day
at
bensersiel
and
boiled
to
think
how
von
br√ºning
had
tricked
me
he
had
driven
to
esens
himself
and
read
me
so
well
that
he
actually
offered
to
take
me
with
him
and
i
had
refused
from
excess
of
cleverness
stay
though
if
i
had
happened
to
accept
he
would
have
taken
very
good
care
that
i
saw
nothing
important
the
secret
therefore
was
not
writ
large
on
the
walls
of
esens
was
it
connected
with
bensersiel
too
or
the
country
between
i
searched
the
ordnance
map
again
standing
up
to
get
a
better
light
and
less
jolting
there
was
the
road
northwards
from
esens
to
bensersiel
passing
through
dots
and
squares
the
former
meaning
fen
the
latter
fields
so
the
reference
said
something
else
too
immediately
caught
my
eye
and
that
was
a
stream
running
to
bensersiel
i
knew
it
at
once
for
the
muddy
stream
or
drain
we
had
seen
at
the
harbour
issuing
through
the
sluice
or
from
which
bensersiel
took
its
name
but
it
arrested
my
attention
now
because
it
looked
more
prominent
than
i
should
have
expected
charts
are
apt
to
ignore
the
geography
of
the
mainland
except
in
so
far
as
it
offers
to
mariners
on
the
chart
this
stream
had
been
shown
as
a
rough
little
corkscrew
like
a
tail
on
the
ordnance
map
it
was
marked
with
a
dark
blue
line
was
labelled
tief
and
was
given
a
more
resolute
course
bends
became
angles
and
there
were
what
appeared
to
be
artificial
straightnesses
at
certain
points
one
of
the
threads
in
my
skein
the
canal
thread
tingled
sympathetically
like
a
wire
charged
with
current
standing
astraddle
on
both
seats
with
the
map
close
to
the
lamp
i
greedily
followed
the
course
of
the
southward
it
inclined
away
from
the
road
to
esens
and
passed
the
town
about
a
mile
to
the
west
diving
underneath
the
railway
soon
after
it
took
angular
tacks
to
the
eastward
and
joined
another
blue
line
trending
and
lettered
wittmunder
this
canal
however
came
to
an
abrupt
end
halfway
to
wittmund
a
neighbouring
town
for
the
first
time
that
day
there
came
to
me
a
sense
of
genuine
inspiration
those
shallow
depths
and
short
distances
fractions
of
metres
and
kilometres
which
i
had
overheard
from
b√∂hme
lips
at
memmert
and
which
davies
had
attributed
to
the
outside
channels
did
they
refer
to
a
canal
i
remembered
seeing
barges
in
bensersiel
harbour
i
remembered
conversations
with
the
natives
in
the
inn
scraps
of
the
pompous
loquacity
talks
of
growing
trade
of
bricks
and
grain
passing
from
the
interior
to
the
islands
from
another
source
was
it
the
grocer
of
wangeroog
of
expansion
of
business
in
the
islands
themselves
as
bathing
resorts
from
another
source
again
von
br√ºning
himself
surely
of
dollmann
personal
activity
in
the
development
of
the
islands
in
obscure
connexion
with
these
things
i
saw
the
in
the
canal
it
was
between
dornum
and
esens
that
these
ideas
came
and
i
was
still
absorbed
in
them
when
the
train
drew
up
just
upon
nine
at
my
destination
and
after
ten
minutes
walk
along
with
a
handful
of
other
passengers
i
found
myself
in
the
quiet
cobbled
streets
of
esens
with
the
great
church
steeple
that
we
had
so
often
seen
from
the
sea
soaring
above
me
in
the
moonlight
xxvi
the
seven
siels
selecting
the
very
humblest
i
could
discover
i
laid
down
my
bundle
and
called
for
beer
bread
and
the
landlord
as
i
had
expected
spoke
the
frisian
dialect
so
that
though
he
was
rather
difficult
to
understand
he
had
no
doubts
about
the
purity
of
my
own
german
high
accent
he
was
a
worthy
fellow
and
hospitably
interested
i
want
a
bed
i
was
going
on
to
bensersiel
i
said
sleep
there
and
take
the
morning
to
langeoog
island
i
had
not
forgotten
our
friends
the
twin
giants
and
their
functions
was
not
an
islander
myself
he
asked
but
i
had
a
married
sister
there
had
just
returned
from
a
year
voyaging
and
was
going
to
visit
her
the
way
i
asked
are
they
getting
on
with
the
benser
tief
my
friend
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
was
finished
he
believed
the
connexion
to
wittmund
construction
still
would
be
going
ahead
then
he
supposed
so
but
he
did
not
believe
in
these
schemes
it
was
good
for
trade
i
supposed
esens
would
benefit
in
sending
goods
by
the
tief
what
was
the
traffic
by
the
way
a
few
more
than
before
of
bricks
timber
coals
but
it
would
come
to
nothing
knew
companies
were
an
invention
of
the
devil
a
few
speculators
got
them
up
and
made
money
themselves
out
of
land
and
contracts
while
the
shareholders
they
had
hoodwinked
starved
something
in
that
i
conceded
to
this
bigoted
old
conservative
sister
at
langeoog
rents
her
from
a
man
named
dollmann
they
say
he
owns
a
heap
of
land
about
i
saw
his
yacht
once
pink
velvet
and
electric
light
inside
they
say
the
name
said
mine
host
one
of
them
some
sort
of
foreigner
i
heard
runs
a
salvage
concern
too
juist
way
he
wo
get
any
of
my
savings
i
laughed
and
soon
after
took
my
leave
and
inquired
from
a
the
road
to
dornum
the
railway
i
was
told
with
a
warm
wind
in
my
face
from
the
fleecy
clouds
and
a
overhead
i
set
out
not
for
bensersiel
but
for
benser
tief
which
i
knew
must
cross
the
road
to
dornum
somewhere
a
mile
or
so
of
cobbled
causeway
flanked
with
ditches
and
willows
and
running
cheek
by
jowl
with
the
railway
track
then
a
bridge
and
below
me
the
which
was
in
fact
a
small
canal
a
rutty
track
left
the
road
and
sloped
down
to
it
one
side
a
rough
siding
left
the
railway
and
sloped
down
to
it
on
the
other
i
lit
a
pipe
and
sat
on
the
parapet
for
a
little
no
one
was
stirring
so
with
great
circumspection
i
began
to
reconnoitre
the
left
bank
to
the
north
the
siding
entered
a
fenced
enclosure
by
a
locked
gate
a
gate
i
could
have
easily
climbed
but
i
judged
it
wiser
to
go
round
by
the
bridge
again
and
look
across
the
enclosure
was
a
small
nothing
more
there
were
gaunt
heaps
of
coal
glittering
in
the
moonlight
a
barge
half
loaded
lying
alongside
and
a
deserted
office
building
i
skulked
along
a
sandy
towpath
in
solitude
fens
and
field
were
round
me
as
the
map
had
said
willows
and
the
dim
forms
of
cattle
the
low
melody
of
wind
roaming
unfettered
over
a
plain
once
or
twice
the
flutter
and
quack
of
a
startled
presently
i
came
to
a
farmhouse
dark
and
silent
opposite
it
in
the
canal
a
couple
of
empty
barges
i
climbed
into
one
of
these
and
sounded
with
my
stick
on
the
barely
three
feet
and
the
melted
out
of
my
speculations
the
stream
i
observed
also
was
only
just
wide
enough
for
two
barges
to
pass
with
comfort
other
farms
i
saw
or
thought
i
saw
and
a
few
more
barges
lying
in
linked
by
culverts
to
the
canal
but
nothing
noteworthy
and
mindful
that
i
had
to
explore
the
wittmund
side
of
the
railway
too
i
turned
back
already
a
trifle
damped
in
spirits
but
still
keenly
expectant
passing
under
the
road
and
railway
i
again
followed
the
which
after
half
a
mile
plunged
into
woods
then
entered
a
clearing
and
another
fenced
enclosure
a
by
the
look
of
it
this
time
i
stripped
from
the
waist
downward
waded
over
dressed
again
and
climbed
the
paling
there
was
a
cottage
standing
back
but
its
occupants
evidently
slept
i
was
in
a
by
the
stacks
of
wood
and
the
steam
but
something
more
than
a
for
as
i
warily
advanced
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
i
came
to
a
long
tin
shed
which
strangely
reminded
me
of
memmert
and
below
it
nearer
the
canal
loomed
a
dark
skeleton
framework
which
proved
to
be
a
vessel
on
stocks
close
by
was
a
similar
object
only
nearly
completed
a
barge
a
paved
slipway
led
to
the
water
here
and
the
canal
broadened
to
a
siding
or
in
which
lay
seven
or
eight
more
barges
in
tiers
i
scaled
another
paling
and
went
on
walking
i
should
think
three
miles
by
the
side
of
the
canal
till
the
question
of
bed
and
ulterior
plans
brought
me
to
a
halt
it
was
past
midnight
and
i
was
adding
little
to
my
information
i
had
encountered
a
but
soon
after
that
there
was
increasing
proof
that
the
canal
was
as
yet
little
used
for
traffic
it
grew
narrower
and
there
were
many
signs
of
recent
labour
for
its
improvement
in
one
place
a
deviation
was
being
excavated
evidently
to
abridge
an
impossible
bend
the
path
had
become
atrocious
and
my
boots
were
heavy
with
clay
bearing
in
mind
the
blue
line
on
the
map
i
considered
it
useless
to
go
farther
and
retraced
my
steps
trying
to
concoct
a
story
which
would
satisfy
an
irritable
esens
that
it
was
a
respectable
wayfarer
and
not
a
tramp
or
a
lunatic
who
knocked
him
up
at
one
or
thereabouts
but
a
much
more
practical
resource
occurred
to
me
as
i
approached
the
for
lodging
free
and
accessible
lay
there
ready
to
hand
i
boarded
one
of
the
empty
barges
in
the
backwater
and
surveyed
my
quarters
for
the
night
it
was
of
a
similar
pattern
to
all
the
others
i
had
seen
a
lighter
strictly
in
the
sense
that
it
had
no
means
of
and
no
separate
quarters
for
a
crew
the
whole
interior
of
the
hull
being
free
for
cargo
at
both
bow
and
stern
there
were
ten
feet
or
so
of
deck
garnished
with
bitts
and
bollards
the
rest
was
an
open
well
flanked
by
waterways
of
substantial
breadth
the
whole
of
stout
construction
and
for
a
humble
lighter
of
and
even
graceful
design
with
a
marked
forward
sheer
and
as
i
had
observed
in
the
specimen
on
the
stocks
easy
lines
at
the
stern
in
short
it
was
apparent
even
to
an
ignorant
landsman
like
myself
that
she
was
designed
not
merely
for
canal
work
but
for
rough
water
and
well
she
might
be
for
though
the
few
miles
of
sea
she
had
to
cross
in
order
to
reach
the
islands
were
both
shallow
and
sheltered
i
knew
from
experience
what
a
vicious
surf
they
could
be
whipped
into
by
a
sudden
gale
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
i
dwelt
on
this
matter
on
limited
lines
i
was
making
progress
but
the
wings
of
imagination
still
drooped
nervelessly
at
my
sides
otherwise
i
perhaps
should
have
examined
this
lighter
more
particularly
instead
of
regarding
it
mainly
as
a
convenient
under
the
was
stored
a
massive
roll
of
tarpaulin
a
corner
of
which
made
an
excellent
blanket
and
my
bundle
a
good
pillow
it
was
a
descent
from
the
luxury
of
last
night
but
a
spy
i
reflected
philosophically
can
not
expect
a
feather
bed
two
nights
running
and
this
one
was
at
any
rate
airier
and
roomier
than
the
bunk
of
the
and
not
so
very
much
harder
when
snugly
ensconced
i
studied
the
map
by
intermittent
it
had
been
dawning
on
me
in
the
last
that
this
canal
was
only
one
of
several
that
in
concentrating
myself
on
esens
and
bensersiel
i
had
forgotten
that
there
were
other
villages
ending
in
siel
also
furnished
on
the
chart
with
corkscrew
streams
and
moreover
that
b√∂hme
statistics
of
depth
and
distance
had
been
marshalled
in
seven
categories
a
to
the
very
first
match
brought
full
recollection
as
to
the
villages
the
suffix
repeated
itself
all
round
the
five
miles
eastward
of
bensersiel
was
neuharlingersiel
and
farther
on
carolinensiel
four
miles
westward
was
dornumersiel
and
farther
on
nessmersiel
and
hilgenriedersiel
that
was
six
on
the
north
coast
of
the
peninsula
alone
on
the
west
coast
facing
the
ems
there
was
only
one
greetsiel
a
good
way
south
of
norden
but
on
the
east
facing
the
jade
there
were
no
less
than
eight
at
very
close
intervals
a
moment
thought
and
i
disregarded
this
latter
group
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
esens
nor
had
they
any
imaginable
as
veins
for
commerce
differing
markedly
in
this
respect
from
the
group
of
six
on
the
north
coast
whose
outlook
was
the
chain
of
islands
and
whose
inland
centre
almost
exactly
was
esens
i
still
wanted
one
to
make
seven
and
as
a
working
hypothesis
added
the
solitary
greetsiel
at
all
seven
villages
streams
debouched
as
at
bensersiel
from
all
seven
points
of
issue
dotted
lines
were
marked
seaward
intersecting
the
great
tidal
sands
and
leading
towards
the
islands
and
on
the
mainland
behind
the
whole
sevenfold
system
ran
the
loop
of
railway
but
there
were
manifold
minor
points
of
difference
no
stream
boasted
so
deep
and
decisive
a
blue
lintel
as
did
benser
tief
none
penetrated
so
far
into
the
hinterland
they
varied
in
length
and
sinuosity
two
those
belonging
to
hilgenriedersiel
and
greetsiel
appeared
not
to
reach
the
railway
at
all
on
the
other
hand
carolinensiel
opposite
wangeroog
island
had
a
branch
line
all
to
itself
match
after
match
waxed
and
waned
as
i
puzzled
over
the
mystic
seven
in
the
end
i
puzzled
myself
to
sleep
with
the
one
fixed
idea
that
on
my
way
back
to
norden
i
must
see
more
of
these
budding
canals
if
such
they
were
my
dreams
that
night
were
of
a
mighty
chain
of
redoubts
and
masked
batteries
couching
among
the
of
desolate
islets
built
by
infinitely
slow
and
secret
labour
fed
by
lethal
cargoes
borne
in
lighters
and
in
charge
of
stealthy
mutes
who
one
and
all
bore
the
likeness
of
grimm
i
was
up
and
away
at
daylight
the
weather
mild
and
showery
meeting
some
navvies
on
my
way
back
to
the
road
who
gave
me
good
morning
and
a
stare
on
the
bridge
i
halted
and
fell
into
torments
of
indecision
there
was
so
much
to
do
and
so
little
time
to
do
it
in
the
whole
problem
seemed
to
have
been
multiplied
by
seven
and
the
total
again
doubled
and
redoubled
seven
blue
lines
on
land
seven
dotted
lines
on
the
sea
seven
islands
in
the
offing
once
i
was
near
deciding
to
put
my
pretext
into
practice
and
cross
to
langeoog
but
that
meant
missing
the
rendezvous
and
i
was
loth
to
do
that
at
any
rate
i
wanted
breakfast
badly
and
the
best
way
to
get
it
and
at
the
same
time
to
open
new
ground
was
to
walk
to
dornum
then
i
should
find
a
blue
line
called
the
leading
to
dornumersiel
on
the
coast
that
explored
i
could
pass
on
to
nesse
where
there
was
another
blue
line
to
nessmersiel
all
this
was
on
the
way
to
norden
and
i
should
have
the
railway
constantly
at
my
back
to
carry
me
there
in
the
evening
the
last
train
my
told
me
was
one
reaching
norden
at
i
could
catch
this
at
hage
station
at
a
brisk
walk
of
six
miles
brought
me
ravenously
hungry
to
dornum
road
and
railway
had
clung
together
all
the
time
and
about
had
been
joined
on
the
left
by
a
third
companion
in
the
shape
of
a
puny
stream
which
i
knew
from
the
map
to
be
the
upper
portion
of
neues
tief
wriggling
and
doubling
like
an
eel
choked
with
sedges
and
reeds
it
had
no
pretensions
to
being
navigable
at
length
it
looped
away
into
the
fens
out
of
sight
only
to
reappear
again
close
to
dornum
in
a
much
more
dignified
guise
there
was
no
siding
where
the
railway
crossed
it
but
at
the
town
itself
which
it
skirted
on
the
east
a
towpath
began
and
a
piled
wharf
had
been
recently
constructed
going
on
to
this
was
a
building
with
the
look
of
a
warehouse
roofless
as
yet
and
with
workmen
on
its
scaffolds
it
sharpened
the
edge
of
my
appetite
if
i
had
been
wise
i
should
have
been
content
with
a
snack
bought
at
a
counter
but
a
thirst
for
hot
coffee
and
clues
induced
me
to
repeat
the
experiment
of
esens
and
seek
a
primitive
i
was
less
lucky
on
this
occasion
the
house
i
chose
was
obscure
enough
but
its
proprietor
was
no
simple
frisian
but
an
rascal
with
shifty
eyes
and
a
debauched
complexion
who
showed
a
most
unwelcome
curiosity
in
his
customer
as
a
last
fatality
he
wore
a
peaked
cap
like
my
own
and
turned
out
to
be
an
i
should
have
fled
at
the
sight
of
him
had
i
had
the
chance
but
i
was
attended
to
first
by
a
slatternly
girl
who
i
am
sure
called
him
up
to
view
me
to
explain
my
muddy
boots
and
trousers
i
said
i
had
walked
from
esens
and
from
that
i
found
myself
involved
in
a
tangle
of
impromptu
lies
floundering
down
an
old
groove
i
placed
my
sister
this
time
on
baltrum
island
and
said
i
was
going
to
dornumersiel
which
is
opposite
baltrum
to
cross
from
there
as
this
was
drawing
a
bow
at
a
venture
i
dared
not
assume
local
knowledge
and
spoke
of
the
visit
as
my
first
dornumersiel
was
a
lucky
shot
there
a
from
there
to
baltrum
but
he
knew
or
pretended
to
know
baltrum
and
had
not
heard
of
my
sister
i
grew
the
more
nervous
in
that
i
saw
from
the
first
that
he
took
me
to
be
of
better
condition
than
most
merchant
seamen
and
to
make
matters
worse
i
was
imprudent
enough
in
pleading
haste
to
pull
out
from
an
inner
pocket
my
gold
watch
with
the
chain
and
seals
attached
he
told
me
there
was
no
hurry
that
i
should
miss
the
tide
at
dornumersiel
and
then
fell
to
pressing
strong
waters
on
me
and
asking
questions
whose
insinuating
grossness
gave
me
the
key
to
his
biography
he
must
have
been
at
one
stage
in
his
career
a
crimp
one
of
those
foul
sharks
who
prey
on
discharged
seamen
and
as
often
as
not
are
themselves
versed
in
the
weaknesses
of
the
tribe
he
was
now
keeping
his
hand
in
with
me
who
unhappily
purported
to
belong
to
the
very
class
he
was
used
to
victimize
and
moreover
had
a
gold
watch
and
doubtless
a
full
purse
nothing
more
ridiculously
inopportune
could
have
befallen
me
or
more
dangerous
for
his
class
are
as
cosmopolitan
as
waiters
and
with
as
facile
a
gift
for
language
and
as
unerring
a
scent
for
nationality
sure
enough
the
fellow
recognized
mine
and
positively
challenged
me
with
it
in
fairly
fluent
english
with
a
yankee
twang
encumbered
with
the
mythical
sister
of
course
i
stuck
to
my
lie
said
i
had
been
on
an
english
ship
so
long
that
i
had
picked
up
the
accent
and
also
gave
him
some
words
in
broken
english
at
the
same
time
i
showed
i
thought
him
an
impertinent
nuisance
paid
my
score
and
walked
out
quit
of
him
not
a
bit
of
it
he
insisted
on
showing
me
the
way
to
dornumersiel
and
followed
me
down
the
street
perceiving
that
he
was
in
liquor
in
spite
of
the
early
hour
i
dared
not
risk
a
quarrelsome
scene
with
a
man
who
already
knew
so
much
about
me
and
might
at
any
moment
elicit
more
so
i
melted
and
humoured
him
treated
him
in
a
ginshop
in
the
hope
of
giving
him
the
slip
a
disastrous
resource
which
was
made
a
precedent
for
further
potations
elsewhere
i
would
gladly
draw
a
veil
over
our
scandalous
progress
through
peaceable
dornum
of
the
terrors
i
experienced
when
he
introduced
me
as
his
friend
and
as
his
english
friend
and
of
the
abasement
i
felt
too
as
linked
arm
in
arm
we
trod
the
three
miles
of
road
coastwards
it
was
his
malicious
whim
that
we
should
talk
english
a
fortunate
whim
as
it
turned
out
because
i
knew
no
german
but
had
a
smattering
of
english
gathered
from
cutcliffe
hyne
and
kipling
with
these
i
extemporized
a
disreputable
hybrid
mostly
consisting
of
oaths
and
blasphemies
and
so
yarned
of
imaginary
voyages
of
course
he
knew
every
port
in
the
world
but
happily
was
none
too
critical
owing
to
repeated
nevertheless
it
was
a
deplorable
from
every
point
of
view
i
was
wasting
my
time
for
the
road
took
a
different
direction
to
the
neues
tief
so
that
i
had
not
even
the
advantage
of
inspecting
the
canal
and
only
met
with
it
when
we
reached
the
sea
here
it
split
into
two
mouths
both
furnished
with
locks
and
emptying
into
two
little
harbours
replicas
of
bensersiel
each
owning
its
cluster
of
houses
i
made
straight
for
the
at
dornumersiel
primed
my
companion
well
and
asked
him
to
wait
while
i
saw
about
a
boat
in
the
harbour
but
needless
to
say
i
never
rejoined
him
i
just
took
a
cursory
look
at
the
harbour
saw
a
lighter
locking
through
for
the
tide
was
high
and
then
walked
as
fast
as
my
legs
would
carry
me
to
the
outermost
dyke
mounted
it
and
strode
along
the
sea
westwards
in
the
teeth
of
a
smart
shower
of
rain
full
of
deep
apprehensions
as
to
the
stir
and
gossip
my
disappearance
might
cause
if
my
odious
crimp
was
sober
enough
to
discover
it
as
soon
as
i
deemed
it
safe
i
dropped
on
to
the
sand
and
ran
till
i
could
run
no
more
then
i
sat
on
my
bundle
with
my
back
to
the
dyke
in
partial
shelter
from
the
rain
watching
the
sea
recede
from
the
flats
and
dwindle
into
slender
meres
and
the
laden
clouds
fly
weeping
over
the
islands
till
those
pale
shapes
were
lost
in
mist
the
barge
i
had
seen
locking
through
was
creeping
across
towards
langeoog
behind
a
tug
and
a
wisp
of
smoke
no
more
exploration
by
daylight
that
was
my
first
resolve
for
i
felt
as
if
the
country
must
be
ringing
with
reports
of
an
englishman
in
disguise
i
must
remain
in
hiding
till
dusk
then
regain
the
railway
and
slink
into
that
train
to
norden
now
directly
i
began
to
resign
myself
to
temporary
inaction
and
to
centre
my
thoughts
on
the
rendezvous
a
new
doubt
assailed
me
nothing
had
seemed
more
certain
yesterday
than
that
norden
was
the
scene
of
the
rendezvous
but
that
was
before
the
seven
had
come
into
prominence
the
name
norden
now
sounded
naked
and
unconvincing
as
i
wondered
why
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
the
stations
along
this
northern
line
though
farther
inland
than
norden
were
equally
stations
in
the
sense
that
they
were
in
touch
with
harbours
of
a
sort
on
the
coast
norden
had
its
tidal
creek
but
esens
and
dornum
had
their
or
canals
fool
that
i
had
been
to
put
such
a
narrow
and
literal
construction
on
the
phrase
tide
serves
which
was
it
more
likely
that
my
conspirators
would
visit
norden
whose
intrusion
into
our
theories
was
purely
hypothetical
or
one
of
these
to
whose
sevenfold
systems
all
my
latest
observations
gave
such
transcendent
significance
there
was
only
one
answer
and
it
filled
me
with
profound
discouragement
seven
possible
rendezvous
eight
counting
norden
which
to
make
for
out
came
the
and
map
and
with
them
hope
the
case
was
not
so
bad
after
all
it
demanded
no
immediate
change
of
plan
though
it
imported
grave
uncertainties
and
risks
norden
was
still
the
objective
but
mainly
as
a
railway
junction
only
remotely
as
a
seaport
though
the
possible
rendezvous
were
eight
the
possible
stations
were
reduced
to
five
norden
hage
dornum
esens
wittmund
all
on
one
single
line
trains
from
east
to
west
along
this
line
were
negligible
because
there
were
none
that
could
be
called
night
trains
the
latest
being
the
one
i
had
this
morning
fixed
on
to
bring
me
to
norden
where
it
arrived
at
of
trains
from
west
to
east
there
was
only
one
that
need
be
considered
the
same
one
that
i
had
travelled
by
last
night
leaving
norden
at
and
reaching
esens
at
and
wittmund
at
this
train
as
the
reader
who
was
with
me
in
it
knows
was
in
correspondence
with
another
from
emden
and
the
south
and
also
i
now
found
with
services
from
hanover
bremen
and
berlin
he
will
also
remember
that
i
had
to
wait
of
an
hour
at
norden
from
to
the
platform
at
norden
junction
therefore
between
when
i
should
arrive
at
it
the
east
and
when
b√∂hme
and
his
unknown
friend
should
leave
it
the
east
there
and
in
that
was
my
opportunity
for
recognizing
and
shadowing
two
at
least
of
the
conspirators
i
must
take
the
train
they
took
and
alight
where
they
alighted
if
i
could
not
find
them
at
all
i
should
be
thrown
back
on
the
rejected
view
that
norden
itself
was
the
rendezvous
and
should
wait
there
till
in
the
meantime
it
was
all
very
well
to
resolve
on
inaction
till
dusk
but
after
an
hour
rest
damp
clothes
and
feet
and
the
absence
of
pursuers
tempted
me
to
take
the
field
again
avoiding
roads
and
villages
as
long
as
it
was
light
i
cut
across
country
a
dismal
and
laborious
journey
with
oozy
fens
and
drains
to
course
with
circuits
to
be
made
to
pass
clear
of
peasants
and
many
furtive
crouchings
behind
dykes
and
willows
what
little
i
learnt
was
in
harmony
with
previous
explorations
for
my
track
cut
at
right
angles
the
line
of
the
harke
tief
the
stream
issuing
at
nessmersiel
it
too
was
in
the
nature
of
a
canal
but
only
in
embryo
at
the
point
i
touched
it
south
of
nesse
works
on
a
deviation
were
in
progress
and
in
a
short
digression
down
stream
i
sighted
another
yard
as
for
hilgenriedersiel
the
fourth
of
the
seven
i
had
no
time
to
see
anything
of
it
at
all
at
seven
i
was
at
hage
station
very
tired
wet
and
footsore
after
covering
nearly
twenty
miles
all
told
since
i
left
my
bed
in
the
lighter
from
here
to
norden
it
was
a
run
in
the
train
of
ten
minutes
which
i
spent
in
eating
some
rye
bread
and
smoked
eel
and
in
scraping
the
mud
off
my
boots
and
trousers
fatigue
vanished
when
the
train
drew
up
at
the
station
and
the
momentous
minutes
began
to
run
their
course
having
donned
a
bulky
muffler
and
turned
up
the
collar
of
my
i
crossed
over
immediately
to
the
walked
boldly
to
the
and
at
once
sighted
von
br√ºning
yes
von
br√ºning
in
mufti
but
there
was
no
mistaking
his
tall
athletic
figure
pleasant
features
and
neat
brown
beard
he
was
just
leaving
the
window
gathering
up
a
ticket
and
some
coins
i
joined
a
of
three
or
four
persons
who
were
waiting
their
turn
flattened
myself
between
them
and
the
partition
till
i
heard
him
walk
out
not
having
heard
what
station
he
had
booked
for
i
took
a
ticket
to
wittmund
which
covered
all
chances
then
with
my
chin
buried
in
my
muffler
i
sought
the
darkest
corner
of
the
combination
of
bar
and
where
by
the
tiresome
custom
in
germany
travellers
are
penned
till
their
train
is
ready
von
br√ºning
i
perceived
sitting
in
another
corner
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
a
cigar
between
his
lips
a
boy
brought
me
a
tankard
of
tawny
munich
beer
and
sipping
it
i
watched
people
passed
in
and
out
but
nobody
spoke
to
the
sailor
in
mufti
when
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
a
platform
door
opened
and
a
raucous
voice
shouted
dornum
esens
wittmund
a
knot
of
passengers
jostled
out
to
the
platform
showing
their
tickets
i
was
slow
over
my
beer
and
was
last
of
the
knot
with
von
br√ºning
immediately
ahead
of
me
so
close
that
his
curled
into
my
face
i
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
ticket
he
showed
missed
the
name
but
caught
a
muttered
double
sibilant
from
the
official
who
checked
it
ran
over
the
stations
in
my
head
and
pounced
on
that
was
as
much
i
wanted
to
know
for
the
present
so
i
made
my
way
to
a
compartment
and
lost
sight
of
my
quarry
not
venturing
till
the
last
door
had
banged
to
look
out
of
the
window
when
i
did
so
two
late
arrivals
were
hurrying
up
to
a
carriage
one
tall
one
of
middle
height
both
in
cloaks
and
comforters
their
features
i
could
not
distinguish
but
certainly
neither
of
them
was
b√∂hme
they
had
not
come
through
the
door
but
plainly
from
the
dark
end
of
the
platform
where
they
had
been
waiting
a
guard
with
some
surly
remonstrances
shut
them
in
and
the
train
started
esens
the
name
had
not
surprised
me
it
fulfilled
a
presentiment
that
had
been
growing
in
strength
all
the
afternoon
for
the
last
time
i
referred
to
the
map
pulpy
and
blurred
with
the
exposure
and
tried
to
etch
it
into
my
brain
i
marked
the
road
to
bensersiel
and
how
it
converged
by
degrees
on
the
benser
tief
until
they
met
at
the
sea
tide
serves
longing
for
davies
to
help
me
i
reckoned
by
the
aid
of
my
diary
that
high
tide
at
bensersiel
would
be
about
eleven
and
for
two
hours
i
remembered
say
from
ten
to
twelve
there
were
from
five
to
six
feet
of
water
in
the
harbour
we
should
reach
esens
at
would
they
drive
as
von
br√ºning
had
done
a
week
ago
i
tightened
my
belt
stamped
my
boots
and
thanked
god
for
the
munich
beer
whither
were
they
going
from
bensersiel
and
in
what
and
how
was
i
to
follow
them
these
were
nebulous
questions
but
i
was
in
fettle
for
anything
was
a
bagatelle
fortune
i
thought
smiled
romance
beckoned
even
the
sea
looked
kind
ay
and
i
do
not
know
but
that
imagination
was
already
beginning
to
unstiffen
and
flutter
those
nerveless
wings
xxvii
the
luck
of
the
stowaway
at
esens
station
i
reversed
my
norden
tactics
jumped
out
smartly
and
got
to
the
door
of
egress
first
of
all
gave
up
my
ticket
and
hung
about
the
gate
of
the
station
under
cover
of
darkness
fortune
smiled
still
there
was
no
vehicle
in
waiting
at
all
and
there
were
only
half
a
dozen
passengers
two
of
these
were
the
cloaked
gentlemen
who
had
been
so
nearly
left
behind
at
norden
and
another
was
von
br√ºning
the
latter
walked
well
in
advance
of
the
first
pair
but
at
the
gate
on
to
the
high
road
the
three
showed
a
common
purpose
in
that
unlike
the
rest
who
turned
towards
esens
town
they
turned
southwards
much
to
my
perplexity
for
this
was
the
contrary
direction
to
bensersiel
and
the
sea
i
with
my
bundle
on
my
shoulder
had
been
bringing
up
the
rear
and
as
their
faithful
shadow
turned
to
the
right
too
without
foreseeing
the
consequence
when
it
was
too
late
to
turn
back
i
saw
that
fifty
yards
ahead
the
road
was
barred
by
the
gates
of
a
level
crossing
and
that
the
four
of
us
must
inevitably
accumulate
at
the
barrier
till
the
train
had
steamed
away
this
in
fact
happened
and
for
a
minute
or
two
we
were
all
in
a
group
elaborately
indifferent
to
one
another
silent
but
i
am
sure
very
conscious
as
for
me
laughter
tickled
all
my
soul
when
the
gates
were
opened
the
three
seemed
disposed
to
lag
so
i
tactfully
took
my
cue
trudged
briskly
on
ahead
and
stopped
after
a
few
minutes
to
listen
hearing
nothing
i
went
cautiously
back
and
found
that
they
had
disappeared
in
which
direction
was
not
long
in
doubt
for
i
came
on
a
grassy
path
leading
into
the
fields
on
the
left
or
west
of
the
road
and
though
i
could
see
no
one
i
heard
the
distant
murmur
of
receding
voices
i
took
my
bearings
collectedly
placed
one
foot
on
the
path
thought
better
of
it
and
turned
back
towards
esens
i
knew
without
reference
to
the
map
that
that
path
would
bring
them
to
the
benser
tief
at
a
point
somewhere
near
the
in
a
fog
i
might
have
followed
them
there
as
it
was
the
night
was
none
too
dark
and
i
had
my
strength
to
husband
and
stamped
on
my
memory
were
the
words
tide
serves
i
judged
it
a
wiser
use
of
time
and
sinew
to
anticipate
them
at
bensersiel
by
the
shortest
road
leaving
them
to
reach
it
by
way
of
the
devious
tief
to
examine
which
was
i
felt
convinced
one
of
their
objects
it
was
nine
of
a
fresh
wild
night
a
halo
round
the
beclouded
moon
i
passed
through
quiet
esens
and
in
an
hour
i
was
close
to
bensersiel
and
could
hear
the
sea
in
the
rooted
idea
that
i
should
find
grimm
on
the
outskirts
awaiting
visitors
i
left
the
road
short
of
the
village
and
made
a
circuit
to
the
harbour
by
way
of
the
the
lower
windows
of
the
inn
shed
a
warm
glow
into
the
night
and
within
i
could
see
the
village
circle
gathered
over
cards
and
dominated
as
of
old
by
the
assertive
little
postmaster
whose
excitable
voice
i
could
clearly
distinguish
as
he
sat
with
his
cap
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
a
schnapps
at
his
elbow
the
harbour
itself
looked
exactly
the
same
as
i
remembered
it
a
week
ago
the
lay
in
her
old
berth
at
the
eastern
jetty
her
mainsail
set
and
her
twin
giants
spitting
over
the
rail
i
hailed
them
boldly
from
the
shore
without
showing
them
who
i
was
and
was
told
they
were
starting
for
langeoog
in
a
few
minutes
the
wind
was
the
mails
aboard
and
the
water
just
high
enough
i
want
a
passage
i
thought
i
would
wait
positive
that
my
party
could
never
have
got
here
so
soon
i
nevertheless
kept
an
eye
on
the
galliot
till
she
let
go
her
and
slid
away
one
contingency
was
eliminated
some
loiterers
dispersed
and
all
port
business
appeared
to
be
ended
for
the
night
of
an
hour
of
strained
suspense
ensued
most
of
it
i
spent
on
my
knees
in
a
dark
angle
between
the
dyke
and
the
western
jetty
whence
i
had
a
strategic
survey
of
the
basin
but
i
was
driven
at
times
to
relieve
inaction
by
sallies
which
increased
in
audacity
i
scouted
on
the
road
beyond
the
bridge
hovered
round
the
lock
and
peered
in
at
the
inn
parlour
but
nowhere
could
i
see
a
trace
of
grimm
i
examined
every
floating
object
in
the
harbour
they
were
very
few
dropped
on
to
two
lighters
and
pried
under
tarpaulins
boarded
a
deserted
tug
and
two
or
three
clumsy
rowboats
tied
up
to
a
only
one
of
these
had
the
look
of
readiness
the
rest
being
devoid
of
oars
and
rowlocks
a
discouraging
state
of
things
for
a
prospective
it
was
the
sight
of
these
rowboats
that
suggested
a
last
and
most
distracting
possibility
namely
that
the
boat
in
waiting
if
boat
there
were
might
be
not
in
the
harbour
at
all
but
somewhere
on
the
sands
outside
the
dyke
where
at
this
high
state
of
the
tide
it
would
have
water
and
to
spare
back
to
the
dyke
then
but
as
i
peered
seaward
on
the
way
contingencies
evaporated
and
a
solid
fact
supervened
for
i
saw
the
lights
of
a
steamboat
approaching
the
harbour
mouth
i
had
barely
time
to
gain
my
coign
of
vantage
before
she
had
swept
in
between
the
piers
and
with
a
fitful
swizzling
of
her
screw
was
turning
and
backing
down
to
a
berth
just
ahead
of
one
of
the
lighters
and
not
fifty
feet
from
my
a
jumped
ashore
with
a
rope
while
the
man
at
the
wheel
gave
gruff
directions
the
vessel
was
a
small
tug
and
the
man
at
the
wheel
disclosed
his
identity
when
having
rung
off
his
engines
he
jumped
ashore
also
looked
at
his
watch
in
the
beam
of
the
sidelight
and
walked
towards
the
village
it
was
grimm
by
the
height
and
build
grimm
clad
in
a
long
tarpaulin
coat
and
a
i
watched
him
cross
the
shaft
of
light
from
the
inn
window
and
disappear
in
the
direction
of
the
canal
another
sailor
now
appeared
and
helped
his
fellow
to
tie
up
the
tug
the
two
together
then
went
aft
and
began
to
set
about
some
job
whose
nature
i
could
not
determine
to
emerge
was
perilous
so
i
set
about
a
job
of
my
own
tearing
open
my
bundle
and
pulling
an
oilskin
jacket
and
trousers
over
my
clothes
and
discarding
my
peaked
cap
for
a
this
operation
was
prompted
instantaneously
by
the
garb
of
two
sailors
who
in
hauling
on
the
forward
warp
came
into
the
field
of
the
light
it
was
something
of
a
gymnastic
masterpiece
since
i
was
lying
or
rather
standing
aslant
on
the
rough
with
crannies
of
brick
for
foothold
and
the
water
plashing
below
me
but
then
i
had
not
lived
in
the
for
nothing
my
chain
of
thought
i
fancy
was
this
the
tug
is
to
carry
my
party
i
can
not
shadow
a
tug
in
a
rowboat
yet
i
intend
to
shadow
my
party
i
must
therefore
go
with
them
in
the
tug
and
the
first
and
soundest
step
is
to
mimic
her
crew
but
the
next
step
was
a
hard
matter
for
the
crew
having
finished
their
job
sat
side
by
side
on
the
bulwarks
and
lit
their
pipes
however
a
little
pantomime
soon
occurred
as
amusing
as
it
was
inspiriting
they
seemed
to
consult
together
looking
from
the
tug
to
the
inn
and
from
the
inn
to
the
tug
one
of
them
walked
a
few
paces
and
beckoned
to
the
other
who
in
his
turn
called
something
down
the
skylight
and
then
joined
his
mate
in
a
scuttle
to
the
inn
even
while
i
watched
the
pantomime
i
was
sliding
off
my
boots
and
it
had
not
been
consummated
a
second
before
i
had
them
in
my
arms
and
was
tripping
over
the
mud
in
my
stocking
feet
a
dozen
noiseless
steps
and
i
was
over
the
bulwarks
between
the
wheel
and
the
casting
about
for
a
the
conventional
stowaway
hides
in
the
hold
but
there
was
only
a
stokehold
here
occupied
moreover
nor
was
there
an
empty
such
as
jim
of
found
so
useful
as
far
as
i
could
see
and
i
dared
not
venture
far
for
fear
of
the
skylight
the
surface
of
the
deck
offered
nothing
secure
but
on
the
farther
or
starboard
side
rather
abaft
the
beam
there
was
a
small
boat
in
davits
swung
outboard
to
which
common
sense
and
perhaps
a
vague
prescience
of
its
after
utility
pointed
irresistibly
in
any
case
discrimination
was
out
of
place
so
i
mounted
the
bulwark
and
gently
entered
my
refuge
the
tackles
creaked
a
trifle
oars
and
seats
impeded
me
but
well
before
the
thirsty
truants
had
returned
i
was
settled
on
the
floor
boards
between
two
thwarts
so
placed
that
i
could
if
necessary
peep
over
the
gunwale
the
two
sailors
returned
at
a
run
and
very
soon
after
voices
approached
and
i
recognized
that
of
herr
schenkel
chattering
volubly
he
and
grimm
boarded
the
tug
and
went
down
a
companionway
aft
near
which
as
i
peeped
over
i
saw
a
second
skylight
no
bigger
than
the
illuminated
from
below
then
i
heard
a
cork
drawn
and
the
kiss
of
glasses
and
in
a
minute
or
two
they
it
was
apparent
that
herr
schenkel
was
inclined
to
stay
and
make
merry
and
that
grimm
was
anxious
to
get
rid
of
him
and
none
too
courteous
in
showing
it
the
former
urged
that
tide
would
do
the
latter
gave
orders
to
cast
off
and
at
length
observed
with
an
angry
oath
that
the
water
was
falling
and
he
must
start
and
to
clinch
matters
with
a
curt
he
went
to
the
wheel
and
rang
up
his
engines
herr
schenkel
landed
and
strutted
off
in
high
dudgeon
while
the
tug
screw
began
to
revolve
we
had
only
glided
a
few
yards
on
when
the
engines
stopped
a
short
blast
of
the
whistle
sounded
and
before
i
had
had
time
to
recast
the
future
i
heard
a
scurry
of
footsteps
from
the
direction
of
the
dyke
first
on
the
bank
next
on
the
deck
the
last
of
these
new
arrivals
panted
audibly
as
he
got
aboard
and
dropped
on
the
planks
with
an
unelastic
thud
her
complement
made
up
the
tug
left
the
harbour
but
not
alone
while
slowly
gathering
way
the
hull
checked
all
at
once
with
a
sharp
jerk
recovered
and
increased
its
speed
we
had
something
in
tow
what
the
lighter
of
course
that
had
been
lying
astern
of
us
now
i
knew
what
was
in
that
lighter
because
i
had
been
to
see
half
an
hour
ago
it
was
no
lethal
cargo
but
coal
common
household
coal
not
a
full
load
of
it
i
remembered
just
a
mound
amidships
trimmed
with
battens
fore
and
aft
to
prevent
shifting
thought
i
is
intelligible
enough
grimm
was
ostensibly
there
to
call
for
a
load
of
coal
for
memmert
but
does
that
mean
we
are
going
to
memmert
at
the
same
time
i
recalled
a
phrase
overheard
at
the
dep√¥t
one
half
a
load
why
half
a
load
for
some
few
minutes
there
was
a
good
deal
of
movement
on
deck
and
of
orders
shouted
by
grimm
and
answered
by
a
voice
from
far
astern
on
the
lighter
presently
however
the
tug
warmed
to
her
work
the
hull
vibrated
with
energy
and
an
ordered
peace
reigned
on
board
i
also
realized
that
having
issued
from
the
boomed
channel
we
had
turned
westward
for
the
wind
which
had
been
blowing
us
fair
now
blew
strongly
over
the
port
beam
i
peeped
out
of
my
eyrie
and
was
satisfied
in
a
moment
that
as
long
as
i
made
no
noise
and
observed
proper
prudence
i
was
perfectly
safe
the
boat
was
there
were
no
deck
lamps
the
two
skylights
diffused
but
a
sickly
radiance
and
i
was
abaft
the
i
was
abaft
the
wheel
also
though
thrillingly
near
it
in
point
of
distance
about
twelve
feet
i
should
say
and
grimm
was
steering
the
wheel
i
should
mention
here
was
raised
as
you
often
see
them
on
a
sort
of
pulpit
approached
by
two
or
three
steps
and
fenced
by
a
arc
of
boarding
only
one
of
the
crew
was
visible
and
he
was
acting
as
in
the
extreme
bows
the
rays
of
the
masthead
lights
for
a
second
had
been
hoisted
in
sign
of
towage
glistening
on
his
oilskin
back
the
other
man
i
concluded
was
steering
the
lighter
which
i
could
dimly
locate
by
the
pale
foam
at
her
bow
and
the
passengers
they
were
all
together
aft
three
of
them
leaning
over
the
taffrail
with
their
backs
turned
to
me
one
was
short
and
stout
b√∂hme
unquestionably
the
panting
and
the
thud
on
the
planks
had
prepared
me
for
that
though
where
he
had
sprung
from
i
did
not
know
two
were
tall
and
one
of
these
must
be
von
br√ºning
there
ought
to
be
four
i
reckoned
but
three
were
all
i
could
see
and
what
of
the
third
it
must
be
he
who
on
coming
the
unknown
superior
at
whose
instance
and
for
whose
behoof
this
secret
expedition
had
been
planned
and
who
could
he
be
many
times
needless
to
say
i
had
asked
myself
that
question
but
never
till
now
when
i
had
found
the
rendezvous
and
joined
the
expedition
did
it
become
one
of
burning
import
weather
was
another
of
those
phrases
that
were
it
was
a
dirty
squally
night
not
very
cold
for
the
wind
still
hung
in
the
an
wind
on
this
coast
causing
no
appreciable
sea
on
the
shoal
spaces
we
were
traversing
in
the
matter
of
our
bearings
i
set
myself
doggedly
to
overcome
that
paralysing
perplexity
always
induced
in
me
by
night
or
fog
in
these
intricate
waters
and
by
screwing
round
and
round
succeeded
so
far
as
to
discover
and
identify
two
flashing
lights
one
alternately
red
and
white
far
and
faint
astern
the
other
right
ahead
and
rather
stronger
giving
white
flashes
only
the
first
and
least
familiar
was
i
made
out
from
the
lighthouse
on
wangeroog
the
second
well
known
to
me
as
our
beacon
star
in
the
race
from
memmert
was
the
light
on
the
centre
of
norderney
island
about
ten
miles
away
i
had
no
accurate
idea
of
the
time
for
i
could
not
see
my
watch
but
i
thought
we
must
have
started
about
a
quarter
past
eleven
we
were
travelling
fast
the
funnel
belching
out
smoke
and
the
curling
high
for
the
tug
appeared
to
be
a
powerful
little
craft
and
her
load
was
comparatively
light
so
much
for
the
general
situation
as
for
my
own
predicament
i
was
in
no
mood
to
brood
on
the
hazards
of
this
mad
adventure
a
hundredfold
more
hazardous
than
my
eavesdropping
at
memmert
the
crisis
i
knew
had
come
and
the
reckless
impudence
that
had
brought
me
here
must
serve
me
still
and
extricate
me
fortune
loves
rough
wooing
i
backed
my
luck
and
watched
the
behaviour
of
the
passengers
struck
me
as
odd
they
remained
in
a
row
at
the
taffrail
gazing
astern
like
regretful
emigrants
and
sometimes
gesticulating
and
pointing
now
no
vestige
of
the
low
land
was
visible
so
i
was
driven
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
the
lighter
they
were
discussing
and
i
date
my
awakening
from
the
moment
that
i
realized
this
but
the
thread
broke
prematurely
for
the
passengers
took
to
pacing
the
deck
and
i
had
to
lie
low
when
next
i
was
able
to
raise
my
head
they
were
round
grimm
at
the
wheel
engaged
as
far
as
i
could
discover
from
their
gestures
in
an
argument
about
our
course
and
the
time
for
grimm
looked
at
his
watch
by
the
light
of
a
we
were
heading
north
and
i
knew
by
the
swell
that
we
must
be
near
the
accumer
ee
the
gap
between
langeoog
and
baltrum
were
we
going
out
to
open
sea
it
came
over
me
with
a
rush
that
we
if
we
were
to
drop
this
lighter
at
memmert
had
i
been
davies
i
should
have
been
quicker
to
seize
certain
rigid
conditions
of
this
cruise
which
no
human
power
could
modify
we
had
left
after
high
tide
the
water
therefore
was
falling
everywhere
and
the
tributary
channels
in
rear
of
the
islands
were
slowly
growing
impassable
it
was
quite
thirty
miles
to
memmert
with
three
watersheds
to
pass
behind
baltrum
norderney
and
juist
a
skipper
with
nerve
and
perfect
confidence
might
take
us
over
one
of
these
in
the
dark
but
most
of
the
run
would
infallibly
have
to
be
made
outside
i
now
better
understood
the
protests
of
herr
schenkel
to
grimm
never
once
had
we
seen
a
lighter
in
tow
in
the
open
sea
though
plenty
behind
the
barrier
of
islands
indeed
it
was
the
very
existence
of
the
sheltered
byways
that
created
such
traffic
as
there
was
it
was
only
grimm
and
the
incubus
of
the
lighter
that
had
suggested
memmert
as
our
destination
at
all
and
i
began
to
doubt
it
now
that
tricky
hoop
of
sand
had
befooled
us
before
at
this
moment
and
as
if
to
corroborate
my
thought
the
telegraph
rang
and
the
tug
slowed
down
i
effaced
myself
and
heard
grimm
shouting
to
the
man
on
the
lighter
to
starboard
his
helm
and
to
the
to
come
aft
the
next
order
froze
my
very
marrow
it
was
away
someone
was
at
the
davits
of
my
boat
fingering
the
tackles
the
forward
actually
slipped
in
the
block
and
tilted
the
boat
a
fraction
i
was
just
wondering
how
far
it
was
to
swim
to
langeoog
when
a
strong
imperious
voice
unknown
to
me
rang
out
no
we
do
want
the
boat
the
swell
nothing
we
can
jump
ca
we
b√∂hme
the
speaker
ended
with
a
jovial
laugh
thought
i
going
to
swim
to
langeoog
but
i
also
gasped
for
relief
the
tug
rolled
lifelessly
in
the
swell
for
a
little
and
footsteps
retreated
aft
there
were
cries
of
and
some
laughter
one
big
bump
and
a
good
deal
of
grinding
and
on
we
moved
again
taking
the
strain
of
the
gingerly
and
then
ahead
the
passengers
it
seemed
preferred
the
lighter
to
the
tug
for
cruising
in
and
exposure
to
clean
planks
and
a
warm
cuddy
when
silence
reigned
again
i
peeped
out
grimm
was
at
the
wheel
still
impassively
twirling
the
spokes
with
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
his
precious
freight
and
after
all
we
going
outside
close
on
the
port
hand
lay
a
black
shape
the
east
spit
of
baltrum
it
fused
with
the
night
while
we
swung
slowly
round
to
windward
over
the
troubled
bar
now
we
were
in
the
spacious
deeps
of
the
north
sea
and
feeling
it
too
in
increase
of
swell
and
volleys
of
spray
at
this
point
evolutions
began
grimm
gave
the
wheel
up
to
the
and
himself
went
to
the
taffrail
whence
he
roared
back
orders
of
or
in
response
to
signals
from
the
lighter
we
made
one
complete
circle
steering
on
each
point
of
the
wind
in
succession
after
that
worked
straight
out
to
sea
till
the
water
was
a
good
deal
rougher
and
back
again
at
a
tangent
till
in
earshot
of
the
surf
on
the
island
beach
there
the
manoeuvres
which
were
clearly
in
the
nature
of
a
trial
trip
ended
and
we
hove
to
to
transship
our
passengers
they
when
they
came
aboard
went
straight
below
and
grimm
having
steadied
the
tug
on
a
settled
course
and
entrusted
the
wheel
to
the
sailor
again
stripped
off
his
dripping
oilskin
coat
threw
it
down
on
the
cabin
skylight
and
followed
them
the
course
he
had
set
was
about
west
with
norderney
light
a
couple
of
points
off
the
port
bow
the
course
for
memmert
possibly
but
i
cared
not
for
my
mind
was
far
from
memmert
was
the
course
for
england
yes
i
understood
at
last
i
was
assisting
at
an
experimental
rehearsal
of
a
great
scene
to
be
enacted
perhaps
in
the
near
future
a
scene
when
multitudes
of
seagoing
lighters
carrying
full
loads
of
soldiers
not
half
loads
of
coals
should
issue
simultaneously
in
seven
ordered
fleets
from
seven
shallow
outlets
and
under
escort
of
the
imperial
navy
traverse
the
north
sea
and
throw
themselves
bodily
upon
english
shores
indulgent
reader
you
may
be
pleased
to
say
that
i
have
been
very
obtuse
and
yet
with
humility
i
protest
against
that
verdict
remember
that
recent
as
are
the
events
i
am
describing
it
is
only
since
they
happened
that
the
possibility
of
an
invasion
of
england
by
germany
has
become
a
topic
of
public
discussion
davies
and
i
had
never
i
was
going
to
say
had
never
considered
it
but
that
would
not
be
accurate
for
we
had
glanced
at
it
once
or
twice
and
if
any
single
incident
in
his
or
our
joint
cruise
had
provided
a
semblance
of
confirmation
he
at
any
rate
would
have
kindled
to
that
spark
but
you
will
see
how
perversely
from
first
to
last
circumstances
drove
us
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
wrong
groove
till
the
idea
became
inveterate
that
the
secret
we
were
seeking
was
one
of
defence
and
not
offence
hence
a
complete
mental
somersault
was
required
and
as
an
amateur
i
found
it
difficult
the
more
so
that
the
method
of
invasion
as
i
darkly
comprehended
it
now
was
of
such
a
strange
and
unprecedented
character
for
orthodox
invasions
start
from
big
ports
and
involve
a
fleet
of
ocean
transports
while
none
of
our
clues
pointed
that
way
to
neglect
obvious
methods
to
draw
on
the
obscure
resources
of
an
obscure
strip
of
coast
to
improve
and
exploit
a
quantity
of
insignificant
streams
and
tidal
outlets
and
thence
screened
by
the
islands
to
despatch
an
armada
of
barges
capable
of
flinging
themselves
on
a
correspondingly
obscure
and
therefore
unexpected
portion
of
the
enemy
coast
that
was
a
conception
so
daring
aye
and
so
quixotic
in
some
of
its
aspects
that
even
now
i
was
half
incredulous
yet
it
must
be
the
true
one
bit
by
bit
the
fragments
of
the
puzzle
fell
into
order
till
a
coherent
whole
was
adumbrated
the
reader
will
find
the
whole
matter
dealt
with
in
the
epilogue
the
tug
surged
on
into
the
night
a
squall
of
rain
leapt
upon
us
and
swept
hissing
astern
baltrum
vanished
and
the
strands
of
norderney
beamed
under
transient
moonlight
drunk
with
triumph
i
cuddled
in
my
rocking
cradle
and
ransacked
every
unvisited
chamber
of
the
memory
tossing
out
their
dusty
contents
to
make
a
joyous
bonfire
of
some
and
to
see
the
residue
take
life
and
meaning
in
the
light
of
the
great
revelation
my
reverie
was
of
things
not
persons
of
vast
national
issues
rather
than
of
the
poignant
human
interests
so
closely
linked
with
them
but
on
a
sudden
i
was
recalled
with
a
shock
to
myself
davies
and
the
present
we
were
changing
our
course
as
i
knew
by
variations
in
the
whirl
of
draughts
which
whistled
about
me
i
heard
grimm
afoot
again
and
choosing
my
moment
surveyed
the
scene
broad
on
the
were
the
garish
lights
of
norderney
town
and
promenade
and
the
tug
i
perceived
was
drawing
in
to
enter
the
see
gat
see
chart
b
round
she
came
hustling
through
the
broken
water
of
the
bar
till
her
nose
was
south
and
the
wind
was
on
the
starboard
bow
not
a
mile
from
me
were
the
villa
and
the
yacht
and
the
three
persons
of
the
drama
three
that
is
if
davies
were
safe
were
we
to
land
at
norderney
harbour
heavens
what
a
magnificent
climax
if
only
i
could
rise
to
it
my
work
here
was
done
at
a
stroke
to
rejoin
davies
and
be
free
to
consummate
our
designs
a
desperate
idea
of
cutting
the
i
blush
to
think
of
the
stupidity
was
rejected
as
soon
as
it
was
born
and
instead
i
endeavoured
to
imagine
our
approach
to
the
pier
my
boat
hung
on
the
starboard
side
that
would
be
the
side
away
from
the
quay
and
the
tide
would
be
low
i
could
swarm
down
the
davits
during
the
stir
of
arrival
drop
into
the
sea
and
swim
the
few
yards
across
the
channel
wade
through
the
mud
to
within
a
short
distance
of
the
and
swim
the
rest
i
rubbed
the
salt
out
of
my
eyes
and
wriggled
my
cramped
legs
hullo
why
was
grimm
leaving
the
helm
again
back
he
went
to
the
cabin
leaving
the
sailor
at
the
helm
we
ought
to
be
turning
to
port
now
but
no
on
we
went
south
for
the
mainland
though
one
plan
was
frustrated
the
longing
to
get
to
davies
once
implanted
waxed
apace
our
destination
was
at
last
beyond
dispute
see
chart
the
channel
we
were
in
was
the
same
that
we
had
cut
across
on
our
blind
voyage
to
memmert
and
the
same
my
had
followed
two
days
ago
it
was
a
leading
to
one
place
only
the
landing
stage
at
norddeich
the
only
place
on
the
whole
coast
now
i
came
to
think
of
it
where
the
tug
could
land
at
this
tide
there
the
quay
would
be
on
the
starboard
side
and
i
saw
myself
tied
to
my
eyrie
while
the
passengers
landed
and
the
tug
and
lighter
turned
back
for
memmert
at
memmert
dawn
and
discovery
there
was
some
way
out
some
way
out
i
repeated
to
myself
some
way
to
reap
the
fruit
of
davies
long
tutelage
in
the
lore
of
this
strange
region
what
would
do
for
answer
there
came
the
familiar
of
gentle
surf
on
drying
sands
the
swell
was
dying
away
the
channel
narrowing
dusky
and
weird
on
the
starboard
hand
stretched
leagues
of
sand
two
men
only
were
on
deck
the
moon
was
quenched
under
the
vanguard
clouds
of
a
fresh
squall
a
madcap
scheme
danced
before
me
the
time
i
know
the
time
crouching
low
and
cloaking
the
flame
with
my
jacket
i
struck
a
match
the
tide
had
been
ebbing
for
about
three
hours
and
a
half
low
water
about
five
they
would
be
aground
till
danger
to
life
none
flares
and
rescuers
not
likely
with
who
on
board
besides
no
one
could
come
there
being
no
danger
i
should
have
a
fair
wind
and
a
fair
tide
for
trip
grimm
coat
was
on
the
skylight
we
were
both
the
helmsman
gazed
ahead
intent
on
his
difficult
course
and
the
wind
howled
to
perfection
i
knelt
up
and
examined
one
of
the
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
it
a
double
and
a
single
block
like
our
own
peak
halyards
the
lower
one
hooked
into
a
ring
in
the
boat
the
hauling
part
made
fast
to
a
cleat
on
the
davit
itself
something
there
must
be
to
give
lateral
support
or
the
boat
would
have
racketed
abroad
in
the
roll
outside
the
support
i
found
consisted
of
two
lanyards
spliced
to
the
davits
and
rove
through
holes
in
the
keel
these
i
leaned
over
and
cut
with
my
the
result
being
a
barely
perceptible
swaying
of
the
boat
for
the
tug
was
under
the
lee
of
sands
and
on
an
even
keel
then
i
left
my
climbing
out
of
the
stern
sheets
by
the
and
preparing
every
successive
motion
with
exquisite
tenderness
till
i
stood
on
the
deck
in
another
moment
i
was
at
the
cabin
skylight
lifting
grimm
long
oilskin
coat
a
yielding
to
temptation
here
but
no
the
skylight
was
ground
glass
fastened
from
below
so
on
with
the
coat
up
with
the
collar
and
forward
to
the
wheel
on
tiptoe
as
soon
as
i
was
up
to
the
skylight
that
is
to
say
well
ahead
of
the
cabin
roof
i
assumed
a
natural
step
went
up
to
the
pulpit
and
touched
the
helmsman
on
the
arm
as
i
had
seen
grimm
do
the
man
stepped
aside
grunting
something
about
a
light
and
i
took
the
wheel
from
him
grimm
was
a
man
of
few
words
so
i
just
jogged
his
satellite
and
pointed
forward
he
went
off
like
a
lamb
to
his
customary
place
in
the
bows
not
having
dreamt
why
should
he
of
examining
me
but
in
him
i
had
instantly
recognized
one
of
the
crew
of
the
my
ruse
developed
in
all
its
delicious
simplicity
we
were
i
estimated
about
to
norddeich
in
the
buse
tief
a
channel
of
a
navigable
breadth
at
the
utmost
of
two
hundred
yards
at
this
period
of
the
tide
two
faint
lights
one
above
the
other
twinkled
far
ahead
what
they
meant
i
neither
knew
nor
cared
since
the
only
use
i
put
them
to
was
to
test
the
effect
of
the
wheel
for
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
tasted
the
sweets
of
command
on
a
steamboat
a
few
cautious
essays
taught
me
the
rudiments
and
nothing
could
hinder
the
catastrophe
now
i
edged
over
to
starboard
that
was
the
side
i
had
selected
and
again
a
little
more
till
the
glistening
back
of
the
gave
a
slight
movement
but
he
was
a
minion
with
implicit
trust
in
the
man
now
hard
over
and
spoke
by
spoke
i
gave
her
the
full
pressure
of
the
helm
the
shouted
a
warning
and
i
raised
my
arm
in
calm
acknowledgement
a
cry
came
from
the
lighter
and
i
remember
i
was
just
thinking
the
dickens
happen
to
her
when
the
end
came
a
so
mild
and
gradual
for
the
sands
are
fringed
with
mud
that
the
disaster
was
on
us
before
i
was
aware
of
it
there
was
just
the
tiniest
premonitory
shuddering
as
our
keel
clove
the
buttery
medium
a
cascade
of
ripples
from
either
beam
and
the
wheel
jammed
to
rigidity
in
my
hands
as
the
tug
nestled
up
to
her
in
the
scene
of
panic
that
followed
it
is
safe
to
say
that
i
was
the
only
soul
on
board
who
acted
with
methodical
tranquillity
the
flew
astern
like
an
arrow
bawling
to
the
lighter
grimm
with
the
passengers
tumbling
up
after
him
was
on
deck
in
an
instant
storming
and
cursing
flung
himself
on
the
wheel
which
i
had
respectfully
abandoned
jangled
the
telegraph
and
wrenched
at
the
spokes
the
tug
listed
over
under
the
force
of
the
tide
wind
darkness
and
rain
aggravated
the
confusion
for
my
part
i
stepped
back
behind
the
smoke
stack
threw
off
my
robe
of
office
and
made
for
the
boat
long
and
bitter
experience
of
running
aground
had
told
me
that
that
was
sure
to
be
wanted
on
the
way
i
cannoned
into
one
of
the
passengers
and
pressed
him
into
my
service
incidentally
seeing
his
face
and
verifying
an
old
conjecture
it
was
one
who
in
germany
has
a
better
right
to
insist
than
anyone
else
as
we
reached
the
davits
there
was
a
report
like
a
from
the
the
parting
i
believe
as
the
lighter
with
her
shallower
draught
swung
on
past
the
tug
fresh
tumult
arose
in
which
i
heard
the
boat
from
grimm
but
the
order
was
already
executed
my
ally
the
passenger
and
i
had
each
cast
off
a
tackle
and
slacked
away
with
a
run
that
done
i
promptly
clutched
the
wire
guy
to
steady
myself
and
tumbled
in
it
was
not
far
to
tumble
for
the
tug
listed
heavily
to
starboard
think
of
our
course
and
the
set
of
the
ebb
stream
and
you
will
see
why
the
forward
fall
unhooked
sweetly
but
the
after
one
lost
play
away
i
called
peremptorily
and
felt
for
my
knife
my
helper
above
obeyed
the
hook
yielded
i
filliped
away
the
loose
tackle
and
the
boat
floated
away
xxviii
we
achieve
our
double
aim
when
exactly
the
atmosphere
of
misunderstanding
on
the
stranded
tug
was
dissipated
i
do
not
know
for
by
the
time
i
had
fitted
the
rowlocks
and
shipped
sculls
tide
and
wind
had
caught
me
and
were
sweeping
me
merrily
back
on
the
road
to
norderney
whose
lights
twinkled
through
the
scud
in
the
north
with
my
first
few
strokes
i
made
towards
the
lighter
which
i
could
see
sagging
helplessly
to
leeward
but
as
soon
as
i
thought
i
was
out
of
sight
of
the
tug
i
pulled
round
and
worked
out
my
own
salvation
there
was
an
outburst
of
shouting
which
soon
died
away
full
speed
on
a
falling
tide
they
were
pinned
there
for
five
hours
sure
it
was
impossible
to
miss
the
way
and
with
my
stout
allies
heaving
me
forward
i
made
short
work
of
the
passage
there
was
a
sharp
tussle
at
the
last
where
the
riff
gat
poured
its
stream
across
my
path
and
then
i
was
craning
over
my
shoulder
god
knows
with
what
tense
anxiety
for
the
low
hull
and
taper
mast
of
the
not
there
no
not
where
i
had
left
her
i
pulled
furiously
up
the
harbour
past
a
sleeping
and
praise
heaven
came
on
her
warped
alongside
the
jetty
that
came
from
below
as
i
stepped
on
board
it
me
and
davies
and
i
were
pawing
one
another
in
the
dark
of
the
cabin
you
all
right
old
chap
said
he
are
you
a
match
what
the
time
quick
heavens
carruthers
what
the
blazes
have
you
done
to
yourself
i
suspect
i
cut
a
pretty
figure
after
my
two
outing
past
three
it
the
invasion
of
england
is
dollmann
at
the
villa
dollmann
at
the
villa
the
afloat
on
the
mud
devil
are
afloat
think
so
still
but
they
made
me
shift
track
her
out
pole
her
out
cut
those
warps
for
a
few
strenuous
minutes
we
toiled
at
the
sweeps
till
the
was
berthed
ahead
of
the
steamer
in
deeper
water
meanwhile
i
had
whispered
a
few
facts
soon
can
you
get
under
way
i
asked
minutes
daylight
about
seven
first
dawn
about
five
where
are
we
bound
or
england
they
invading
it
now
said
davies
calmly
only
rehearsing
i
laughed
wildly
we
can
wait
can
wait
exactly
an
hour
and
a
half
come
ashore
and
knock
up
dollmann
we
must
denounce
him
and
get
them
both
aboard
it
now
or
never
holy
saints
man
not
as
you
are
he
was
in
pyjamas
clothes
while
he
put
on
christian
attire
i
resumed
my
facts
and
sketched
a
plan
you
watched
i
asked
think
so
by
the
men
the
here
men
grimm
called
for
them
in
that
tug
i
was
watching
and
carruthers
the
is
here
the
roads
outside
did
you
see
her
looking
her
skipper
safe
anyway
so
b√∂hme
so
the
tertium
quid
and
so
are
the
s
men
the
coast
clear
now
or
never
once
more
we
were
traversing
the
long
jetty
and
the
silent
streets
rain
driving
at
our
backs
we
trod
on
air
i
think
i
remember
no
fatigue
davies
sometimes
broke
into
a
little
run
muttering
to
himself
was
right
only
upside
down
he
murmured
more
than
once
really
right
those
channels
are
the
key
to
the
whole
concern
chatham
our
only
eastern
base
no
north
sea
base
or
squadron
land
at
one
of
those
flats
off
the
crouch
and
blackwater
seems
a
wild
scheme
i
observed
in
a
way
so
is
invasion
but
it
thorough
german
no
other
country
could
do
it
it
all
dawning
on
me
by
jove
it
will
be
at
the
much
the
nearest
and
as
sandy
as
this
side
dollmann
been
i
asked
but
queer
and
jumpy
it
too
long
a
story
all
right
by
jove
carruthers
never
mind
we
found
a
at
the
villa
door
and
rang
it
lustily
a
window
aloft
opened
and
message
from
commander
von
br√ºning
urgent
i
called
up
the
window
shut
and
soon
after
the
hall
was
lighted
and
the
door
opened
by
dollmann
in
a
morning
lieutenant
x
i
said
in
english
friends
you
fool
as
the
door
was
flung
nearly
to
it
opened
very
slowly
again
and
we
walked
in
he
hissed
the
sweat
stood
on
his
steep
forehead
and
a
hectic
flush
on
either
cheek
but
there
was
a
smile
what
a
smile
on
his
lips
motioning
us
to
tread
noiselessly
a
vain
ideal
for
me
he
led
the
way
to
the
we
knew
switched
on
the
light
and
faced
us
he
said
in
english
still
smiling
i
consulted
my
watch
and
i
may
say
that
if
my
hand
was
an
index
to
my
general
appearance
i
must
have
looked
the
most
abject
ruffian
under
heaven
probably
understand
one
another
i
said
to
explain
is
to
lose
time
we
sail
for
holland
or
perhaps
england
at
five
at
the
latest
and
we
want
the
pleasure
of
your
company
we
promise
you
immunity
on
certain
conditions
which
can
wait
we
have
only
two
berths
so
that
we
can
only
accommodate
miss
clara
besides
yourself
he
smiled
on
through
this
terse
harangue
but
the
smile
froze
as
though
beneath
it
raged
some
crucial
debate
suddenly
he
laughed
a
low
ironical
laugh
fools
he
said
confounded
meddlesome
young
idiots
i
thought
i
had
done
with
you
promise
me
immunity
give
me
till
five
by
god
i
give
you
five
minutes
to
be
off
to
england
and
be
damned
to
you
or
else
to
be
locked
up
for
spies
what
the
devil
do
you
take
me
for
traitor
in
german
service
said
davies
none
too
firmly
we
were
both
taken
aback
by
this
slashing
attack
tr
you
young
marplots
i
in
service
you
wrecking
the
work
of
years
and
on
the
very
threshold
of
success
for
an
instant
davies
and
i
looked
at
one
another
in
stupefaction
he
lied
i
could
swear
he
lied
but
how
make
sure
did
you
try
to
wreck
davies
said
i
mechanically
they
made
me
clear
him
out
i
knew
he
was
safe
and
safe
he
is
there
was
only
one
thing
for
it
a
last
finesse
to
put
him
to
the
proof
well
i
said
after
a
moment
or
two
clear
out
silence
davies
as
it
appears
we
have
acted
in
error
but
right
to
tell
you
that
we
know
everything
so
loud
curse
you
what
do
you
know
was
taking
notes
at
memmert
the
other
night
to
davies
under
difficulties
of
course
but
i
heard
quite
enough
you
were
reporting
your
english
tour
chatham
you
know
and
the
english
scheme
of
attack
a
mythical
one
no
doubt
as
you
on
the
right
side
b√∂hme
and
the
rest
were
dealing
with
the
german
scheme
of
defence
a
to
g
i
heard
it
all
the
seven
islands
and
the
seven
channels
between
them
davies
knows
every
one
of
them
by
heart
and
then
on
land
the
ring
of
railway
esens
the
centre
the
army
corps
to
mobilize
and
entrench
all
nugatory
wasted
ha
ha
as
you
on
the
right
s
so
loud
you
fiend
of
mischief
he
turned
his
back
and
made
an
irresolute
pace
or
two
towards
the
door
his
hands
kneading
the
folds
of
his
as
they
had
kneaded
the
curtain
at
memmert
twice
he
began
a
question
and
twice
broke
off
congratulate
you
gentlemen
he
said
finally
and
with
more
composure
facing
us
again
have
done
marvels
in
your
misplaced
zeal
but
you
have
compromised
me
too
much
already
i
shall
have
to
have
you
arrested
purely
for
form
sake
you
i
broke
in
have
wasted
five
minutes
and
time
presses
we
sail
at
five
and
purely
for
form
sake
would
rather
have
you
with
us
do
you
mean
he
snarled
had
the
advantage
of
at
memmert
in
spite
of
acoustic
obstacles
your
friends
made
an
appointment
behind
your
back
and
i
in
my
misplaced
zeal
have
taken
some
trouble
to
attend
it
so
that
i
had
a
working
demonstration
on
another
matter
the
invasion
of
england
from
the
seven
davies
nudged
me
i
should
let
that
pistol
alone
and
no
i
would
ring
the
bell
you
can
arrest
us
if
you
like
but
the
secret
in
safe
hands
lie
he
was
right
there
but
he
could
not
know
it
you
suppose
i
have
taken
that
precaution
but
no
names
are
mentioned
he
gave
a
sort
of
groan
sank
into
a
chair
and
seemed
to
age
and
grizzle
before
our
very
eyes
did
you
say
about
immunity
and
clara
he
muttered
friends
we
friends
burst
out
davies
with
a
gulp
in
his
voice
want
to
help
you
both
through
a
sudden
mist
that
filmed
my
eyes
i
saw
him
impetuously
walk
over
and
lay
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
chaps
are
on
our
track
and
yours
come
with
us
wake
her
tell
her
it
be
too
late
soon
x
shrank
from
his
touch
her
i
ca
tell
her
you
tell
her
boy
he
was
huddling
back
into
his
chair
davies
turned
to
me
her
room
i
said
sharply
this
one
up
carruthers
said
davies
i
i
shall
frighten
her
into
a
fit
do
like
to
man
we
both
go
then
make
a
noise
said
a
dazed
voice
we
left
that
huddled
figure
and
stole
upstairs
thickly
carpeted
stairs
luckily
the
door
we
wanted
was
half
open
and
the
room
behind
it
lighted
on
the
threshold
stood
a
slim
white
figure
is
it
father
she
called
in
a
whisper
have
you
been
talking
to
i
pushed
davies
forward
but
he
hung
back
do
be
frightened
i
said
i
carruthers
and
davies
and
davies
may
we
come
in
just
for
one
moment
i
gently
widened
the
opening
of
the
door
while
she
stepped
back
and
put
one
hand
to
her
throat
come
to
your
father
i
said
are
going
to
take
you
both
to
england
in
the
now
at
once
she
had
heard
me
but
her
eyes
wandered
to
davies
understand
not
she
faltered
trembling
and
cowering
in
such
touching
bewilderment
that
i
could
not
bear
to
look
at
her
god
sake
say
something
davies
i
muttered
said
davies
you
not
trust
us
i
heard
a
little
gasp
from
her
there
was
a
flutter
of
lace
and
cambric
and
she
was
in
his
arms
sobbing
like
a
tired
child
her
little
white
feet
between
his
great
clumsy
her
cheek
on
his
rough
jersey
past
four
old
chap
i
remarked
brutally
going
down
to
him
again
no
packing
to
speak
of
mind
they
must
be
out
of
this
in
half
an
hour
i
stumbled
awkwardly
on
the
stairs
again
that
tiresome
film
and
found
him
stuffing
some
papers
into
the
stove
there
were
only
slumbering
embers
in
it
but
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
that
must
be
dressed
in
half
an
hour
i
said
furtively
pocketing
a
pistol
which
lay
on
the
table
you
told
her
take
her
to
england
you
two
boys
i
think
stay
he
sank
into
a
chair
again
she
wo
go
without
you
you
must
for
her
sake
in
half
an
hour
too
i
prefer
to
pass
that
lightly
over
davies
left
before
me
to
prepare
the
yacht
for
sea
and
i
had
to
bear
the
brunt
of
what
followed
including
as
a
mere
episode
a
scene
with
the
the
memory
of
which
rankles
in
me
yet
after
all
she
was
a
sensible
woman
as
for
the
other
two
the
girl
when
i
saw
her
next
in
her
short
boating
skirt
and
was
a
miracle
of
coolness
and
pluck
but
for
her
i
should
never
have
got
him
away
and
ah
how
good
it
was
to
be
out
in
the
wholesome
rain
again
hurrying
to
the
harbour
with
my
two
charges
hurrying
them
down
the
greasy
ladder
to
that
frail
atom
of
english
soil
their
first
guerdon
of
home
and
safety
our
flight
from
the
harbour
was
unmolested
unnoticed
only
the
first
ghastly
evidences
of
dawn
were
mingling
with
the
strangled
moonlight
as
we
tacked
round
the
and
headed
down
the
riff
gat
on
the
lees
of
the
we
had
to
pass
under
the
very
quarter
of
the
so
davies
said
for
of
course
he
alone
was
on
deck
till
we
reached
the
open
sea
day
was
breaking
then
it
was
dead
low
water
and
far
away
to
the
south
between
dun
swathes
of
sand
i
thought
i
saw
but
probably
it
was
only
a
fancy
two
black
stranded
specks
rail
awash
and
decks
streaming
we
took
the
outer
swell
and
clawed
under
the
lee
of
juist
westward
hurrying
westward
the
ems
on
the
flood
and
to
dutch
delfzyl
i
urged
no
thought
davies
it
was
too
near
germany
and
there
was
a
tidal
cut
through
from
buse
tief
better
to
dodge
in
behind
rottum
island
so
on
we
pressed
past
memmert
over
the
juister
reef
and
the
buried
millions
across
the
two
broad
and
yeasty
mouths
of
the
ems
till
rottum
a
wee
lonesome
wafer
of
an
islet
the
first
of
the
dutch
archipelago
was
close
on
the
must
get
in
behind
that
said
davies
we
shall
be
safe
i
think
i
know
the
way
but
get
the
next
chart
and
then
take
a
rest
old
chap
clara
and
i
can
manage
she
had
been
on
deck
most
of
the
time
as
capable
a
hand
as
you
could
wish
for
better
far
than
i
in
my
present
state
of
exhaustion
i
crawled
along
the
slippery
sloping
planks
and
went
below
are
we
cried
dollmann
starting
up
from
the
lee
sofa
where
he
seemed
to
have
been
lying
in
a
sort
of
trance
a
book
his
own
book
slipped
from
his
knees
and
i
saw
the
frontispiece
lying
on
the
floor
in
a
pool
of
oil
for
the
stove
had
gone
adrift
and
the
saloon
was
in
a
wretched
state
of
squalor
and
litter
rottum
i
said
and
knelt
up
to
find
the
chart
there
was
a
look
in
his
eyes
that
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
understood
but
i
can
scarcely
blame
myself
for
the
accumulated
strain
not
only
of
the
last
three
days
and
nights
but
of
the
whole
arduous
month
of
my
cruise
with
davies
was
beginning
to
tell
on
me
now
that
safety
and
success
were
at
hand
i
handed
up
the
chart
through
the
companion
and
then
crept
into
the
reeling
and
lay
down
on
the
spare
with
the
thunder
and
thump
of
the
seas
around
and
above
me
i
must
quote
davies
for
the
event
that
happened
now
for
by
the
time
i
had
responded
to
the
alarm
and
climbed
up
through
the
the
whole
tragedy
was
over
and
done
with
came
up
the
companion
he
says
after
you
went
down
he
held
on
by
the
runner
and
stared
to
windward
at
rottum
as
though
he
knew
the
place
quite
well
and
then
he
came
towards
us
moving
so
unsteadily
that
i
gave
clara
the
tiller
and
went
to
help
him
i
tried
to
make
him
go
down
again
but
he
would
and
came
aft
me
the
helm
he
said
half
to
himself
sea
too
bad
outside
there
a
short
cut
here
i
said
i
know
this
one
i
do
think
i
meant
to
be
sarcastic
he
said
nothing
and
settled
himself
on
the
counter
behind
us
safe
enough
with
his
feet
against
the
and
then
to
my
astonishment
began
to
talk
over
my
shoulder
jolly
sensibly
about
the
course
pointing
out
a
buoy
which
is
wrong
on
the
chart
as
i
knew
and
telling
me
it
was
wrong
and
so
on
well
we
came
to
the
bar
of
the
schild
and
had
to
turn
south
for
that
twisty
bit
of
beating
between
rottum
and
bosch
flat
clara
was
at
the
i
had
the
chart
and
the
tiller
you
know
how
absent
i
get
like
that
there
was
a
bobble
of
sea
and
we
both
had
heaps
to
do
and
well
i
happened
to
look
round
and
he
was
gone
he
had
spoken
for
a
minute
or
two
but
i
believe
the
last
thing
i
heard
him
say
i
was
hardly
attending
at
the
time
for
we
were
in
the
thick
of
it
was
something
about
a
short
cut
again
he
must
have
slipped
over
quietly
he
had
an
ulster
and
big
boots
on
we
cruised
about
for
a
time
but
never
found
him
that
evening
after
threading
the
maze
of
shoals
between
the
dutch
mainland
and
islands
we
anchored
off
the
little
hamlet
of
ostmahorn
see
map
a
gave
the
yacht
in
charge
of
some
astonished
fishermen
and
thence
by
road
and
rail
hurrying
still
gained
harlingen
and
took
passage
on
a
steamer
to
london
from
that
point
our
personal
history
is
of
no
concern
to
the
outside
world
and
here
therefore
i
bring
this
narrative
to
an
end
epilogue
by
the
editor
for
this
chapter
see
map
a
an
interesting
document
somewhat
damaged
by
fire
lies
on
my
study
table
it
is
a
copy
in
cipher
of
a
confidential
memorandum
to
the
german
government
embodying
a
scheme
for
the
invasion
of
england
by
germany
it
is
unsigned
but
internal
evidence
and
the
fact
that
it
was
taken
by
mr
from
the
stove
of
the
villa
at
norderney
leave
no
doubt
as
to
its
authorship
for
many
reasons
it
is
out
of
the
question
to
print
the
textual
translation
of
it
as
deciphered
but
i
propose
to
give
an
outline
of
its
contents
even
this
must
strain
discretion
to
its
uttermost
limits
and
had
i
only
to
consider
the
instructed
few
who
follow
the
trend
of
professional
opinion
on
such
subjects
i
should
leave
the
foregoing
narrative
to
speak
for
itself
but
as
was
stated
in
the
preface
our
primary
purpose
is
to
reach
everyone
and
there
may
be
many
who
in
spite
of
able
and
authoritative
warnings
frequently
uttered
since
these
events
occurred
are
still
prone
to
treat
the
german
danger
as
an
idle
and
may
be
disposed
in
this
case
to
imagine
that
a
baseless
romance
has
been
foisted
on
them
a
few
persons
english
as
well
as
german
hold
that
germany
is
strong
enough
now
to
meet
us
and
throw
an
army
on
our
shores
the
memorandum
rejects
this
view
deferring
isolated
action
for
at
least
a
decade
and
supposing
for
present
purposes
a
coalition
of
three
powers
against
great
britain
and
subsequent
researches
through
the
usual
channels
place
it
beyond
dispute
that
this
condition
was
relied
on
by
the
german
government
in
adopting
the
scheme
they
realized
that
even
if
owing
to
our
widely
scattered
forces
they
gained
that
temporary
command
of
the
north
sea
which
would
be
essential
for
a
successful
landing
they
would
inevitably
lose
it
when
our
standing
fleets
were
concentrated
and
our
reserve
ships
mobilized
with
its
cut
the
prospects
of
the
invading
army
would
be
too
dubious
i
state
it
in
that
mild
way
for
it
seems
not
to
have
been
held
that
failure
was
absolutely
certain
and
rightly
i
think
in
spite
of
the
dogmas
of
the
strategists
for
the
ease
transcends
all
experience
no
man
can
calculate
the
effect
on
our
delicate
economic
fabric
of
a
blow
at
the
industrial
heart
of
the
kingdom
the
great
northern
and
midland
towns
with
their
teeming
populations
of
peaceful
in
this
instance
however
joint
action
the
occasion
for
which
is
perhaps
not
difficult
to
guess
was
distinctly
contemplated
and
germany
in
the
coalition
was
exclusively
that
of
invader
her
fleet
was
to
be
kept
intact
and
she
herself
to
remain
ostensibly
neutral
until
the
first
shock
was
over
and
our
own
either
beaten
or
the
much
more
likely
event
so
crippled
by
a
victory
as
to
be
incapable
of
withstanding
compact
and
unscathed
forces
then
holding
the
balance
of
power
she
would
strike
and
the
blow
it
was
not
till
i
read
this
memorandum
that
i
grasped
the
full
merits
of
that
daring
scheme
under
which
every
advantage
moral
material
and
geographical
possessed
by
germany
is
utilized
to
the
utmost
and
every
disadvantage
of
our
own
turned
to
account
against
us
two
root
principles
pervade
it
perfect
organization
perfect
secrecy
under
the
first
head
come
some
general
considerations
the
writer
who
is
intimately
conversant
with
conditions
on
both
sides
of
the
north
sea
argued
that
germany
is
fitted
to
undertake
an
invasion
of
great
britain
she
has
a
great
army
a
mere
fraction
of
which
would
suffice
in
a
state
of
high
efficiency
but
a
useless
weapon
as
against
us
unless
transported
over
seas
she
has
a
peculiar
genius
for
organization
not
only
in
elaborating
minute
detail
but
in
the
grasp
of
a
coherent
whole
she
knows
the
art
of
giving
a
brain
to
a
machine
of
transmitting
power
to
the
uttermost
and
at
the
same
time
of
concentrating
responsibility
in
a
supreme
centre
she
has
a
small
navy
but
very
effective
for
its
purpose
built
trained
and
manned
on
methodical
principles
for
defined
ends
and
backed
by
an
inexhaustible
reserve
of
men
from
her
maritime
conscription
she
studies
and
practises
between
her
army
and
navy
her
hands
are
free
for
offence
in
home
waters
since
she
has
no
distant
network
of
coveted
colonies
and
dependencies
on
which
to
dissipate
her
defensive
energies
finally
she
is
compared
with
ourselves
economically
independent
having
commercial
access
through
her
land
frontiers
to
the
whole
of
europe
she
has
little
to
lose
and
much
to
gain
the
writer
pauses
here
to
contrast
our
own
situation
and
i
summarize
his
points
we
have
a
small
army
dispersed
over
the
whole
globe
and
administered
on
a
gravely
defective
system
we
have
no
settled
theory
of
national
defence
and
no
competent
authority
whose
business
it
is
to
give
us
one
the
matter
is
still
at
the
stage
of
civilian
controversy
between
the
army
and
navy
is
not
studied
and
practised
much
less
do
there
exist
any
plans
worthy
of
the
name
for
the
repulse
of
an
invasion
or
any
readiness
worth
considering
for
the
prompt
equipment
and
direction
of
our
home
forces
to
meet
a
sudden
emergency
we
have
a
great
and
in
many
respects
a
magnificent
navy
but
not
great
enough
for
the
interests
it
insures
and
with
equally
defective
institutions
not
built
or
manned
methodically
having
an
utterly
inadequate
reserve
of
men
all
classes
of
which
would
be
absorbed
at
the
very
outset
without
a
vestige
of
preparation
for
the
enrolment
of
volunteers
distracted
by
the
multiplicity
of
its
functions
in
guarding
our
colossal
empire
and
commerce
and
conspicuously
lacking
a
brain
not
merely
for
the
smooth
control
of
its
own
unwieldy
mechanism
but
for
the
study
of
rival
aims
and
systems
we
have
no
north
sea
naval
base
no
north
sea
fleet
and
no
north
sea
policy
lastly
we
stand
in
a
highly
dangerous
economical
position
the
writer
then
deals
with
the
method
of
invasion
and
rejects
the
obvious
one
at
once
that
of
sending
forth
a
fleet
of
transports
from
one
or
more
of
the
north
sea
ports
he
combats
especially
the
idea
of
making
emden
the
nearest
to
our
shores
the
port
of
departure
i
mention
this
because
since
his
own
scheme
was
adopted
it
is
instructive
to
note
that
emden
had
been
used
with
caution
as
a
red
herring
by
the
inspired
german
press
when
the
subject
was
mentioned
at
all
and
industriously
dragged
across
the
trail
his
objections
to
the
north
sea
ports
apply
he
remarks
in
reality
to
all
schemes
of
invasion
whether
the
conditions
be
favourable
or
not
one
is
that
secrecy
is
rendered
impossible
and
secrecy
is
vital
the
collection
of
the
transports
would
be
known
in
england
weeks
before
the
hour
was
ripe
for
striking
for
all
large
ports
are
cosmopolitan
and
swarm
with
potential
spies
in
germany
case
moreover
suitable
ships
are
none
too
plentiful
and
the
number
required
would
entail
a
large
deduction
from
her
mercantile
marine
the
other
reason
concerns
the
actual
landing
this
must
take
place
on
an
open
part
of
the
east
coast
of
england
no
other
objective
is
even
considered
now
the
difficulty
of
transshipping
and
landing
troops
by
boats
from
transports
anchored
in
deep
water
in
a
safe
swift
and
orderly
fashion
on
an
open
beach
is
enormous
the
most
hastily
improvised
resistance
might
cause
a
humiliating
disaster
yet
the
first
stage
is
the
most
important
of
all
it
is
imperative
that
the
invaders
should
seize
and
promptly
intrench
a
line
of
country
to
serve
as
an
initial
base
this
once
done
they
can
use
other
resources
they
can
bring
up
transports
land
cavalry
and
heavy
guns
pour
in
stores
and
advance
but
unless
this
is
done
they
are
impotent
be
their
never
so
secure
the
only
logical
alternative
is
then
propounded
to
despatch
an
army
of
infantry
with
the
lightest
type
of
in
big
lighters
towed
by
powerful
but
tugs
under
escort
of
a
powerful
composite
squadron
of
warships
and
to
fling
the
flotilla
at
high
tide
if
possible
straight
upon
the
shore
such
an
expedition
could
be
prepared
in
absolute
secrecy
by
turning
to
account
the
natural
features
of
the
german
coast
no
great
port
was
to
be
concerned
in
any
way
all
that
was
required
was
sufficient
depth
of
water
to
float
the
lighters
and
tugs
and
this
is
supplied
by
seven
insignificant
streams
issuing
from
the
frisian
littoral
and
already
furnished
with
small
harbours
and
with
one
exception
namely
the
tidal
creek
at
norden
for
this
it
appeared
was
one
of
the
chosen
seven
and
not
as
supposed
hilgenriedersiel
which
if
you
remember
he
had
no
time
to
visit
and
which
has
in
fact
no
stream
of
any
value
at
all
and
no
harbour
all
of
these
streams
would
have
to
be
improved
deepened
and
generally
canalized
ostensibly
with
a
commercial
end
for
purposes
of
traffic
with
the
islands
which
are
growing
health
resorts
during
a
limited
summer
season
the
whole
expedition
would
be
organized
under
seven
distinct
not
too
great
a
number
in
view
of
its
cumbrous
character
seawards
the
whole
of
the
coast
is
veiled
by
the
fringe
of
islands
and
the
zone
of
shoals
landwards
the
loop
of
railway
round
the
frisian
peninsula
would
form
the
line
of
communication
in
rear
of
the
seven
streams
esens
was
to
be
the
local
centre
of
administration
when
the
scheme
grew
to
maturity
but
not
till
then
every
detail
for
the
movement
of
troops
under
the
seven
different
heads
was
to
be
arranged
for
with
secrecy
and
exactitude
many
months
in
advance
and
from
headquarters
at
berlin
it
was
not
expected
that
nothing
would
leak
out
but
care
was
to
be
taken
that
anything
that
did
do
so
should
be
attributed
to
defensive
measures
a
standing
feature
in
german
mobilization
being
the
establishment
of
a
corps
of
observation
along
the
frisian
coast
in
fact
the
same
machinery
was
to
be
used
and
its
conversion
for
offence
concealed
up
to
the
latest
possible
moment
the
same
precautions
were
to
be
taken
in
the
preliminary
work
on
the
spot
there
four
men
only
it
was
calculated
need
be
in
full
possession
of
the
secret
one
was
to
represent
the
imperial
navy
a
post
filled
by
our
friend
von
br√ºning
another
b√∂hme
was
to
superintend
the
six
canals
and
the
construction
of
the
lighters
the
functions
of
the
third
were
twofold
he
was
to
organize
what
i
may
call
the
local
labour
that
is
the
helpers
required
for
embarkation
the
crews
of
the
tugs
and
most
important
of
all
the
service
of
pilots
for
the
navigation
of
the
seven
flotillas
through
the
corresponding
channels
to
the
open
sea
he
must
be
a
local
man
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
coast
of
a
social
standing
not
much
above
the
average
of
villagers
and
fishermen
and
he
must
be
ready
when
the
time
was
ripe
with
lists
of
the
right
men
for
the
right
duties
lists
to
which
the
conscription
authorities
could
when
required
give
instant
legal
effect
his
other
function
was
to
police
the
coast
for
spies
and
to
report
anything
suspicious
to
von
br√ºning
who
would
never
be
far
away
on
the
whole
i
think
that
they
found
the
grim
grimm
a
jewel
for
their
purpose
as
fourth
personage
the
writer
designates
himself
the
promoter
of
the
scheme
the
indispensable
link
between
the
two
nations
he
undertakes
to
furnish
reliable
information
as
to
the
disposition
of
troops
in
england
as
to
the
hydrography
of
the
coast
selected
for
the
landing
as
to
the
supplies
available
in
its
vicinity
and
the
strategic
points
to
be
seized
he
proposes
to
be
to
the
expedition
during
transit
and
in
the
meantime
when
not
otherwise
employed
he
was
to
reside
at
norderney
in
close
touch
with
the
other
three
and
controlling
the
commercial
undertakings
which
were
to
throw
dust
in
the
eyes
of
the
curious
memmert
by
the
way
is
not
mentioned
in
this
memorandum
he
speaks
of
the
place
for
the
landing
and
proceeds
to
consider
this
question
in
detail
i
can
not
follow
him
in
his
review
deeply
interesting
though
it
is
and
shall
say
at
once
that
he
reduces
possible
to
two
the
flats
on
the
essex
coast
between
foulness
and
brightlingsea
and
the
wash
with
a
decided
preference
for
the
latter
assuming
that
the
enemy
if
they
got
wind
of
an
invasion
at
all
would
expect
transports
to
be
employed
he
chooses
the
sort
of
spot
which
they
would
be
least
likely
to
defend
and
which
nevertheless
was
suitable
to
the
character
of
the
flotillas
and
similar
to
the
region
they
started
from
there
is
such
a
spot
on
the
lincolnshire
coast
on
the
north
side
of
the
wash
see
map
a
known
as
east
holland
it
is
land
dyked
against
the
sea
and
bordered
like
frisia
with
which
dry
off
at
low
water
it
is
easy
of
access
from
the
east
by
way
of
boston
deeps
a
channel
formed
by
a
detached
bank
called
the
long
sand
lying
parallel
to
the
shore
for
ten
miles
this
bank
makes
a
natural
breakwater
against
the
swell
from
the
east
the
only
quarter
to
be
feared
and
the
deeps
behind
it
where
there
is
an
average
depth
of
feet
at
would
form
an
excellent
roadstead
for
the
covering
squadron
whose
guns
would
command
the
shore
within
easy
range
it
is
noted
in
passing
that
this
is
just
the
case
where
german
battleships
would
have
an
advantage
over
british
ships
of
the
same
calibre
the
latter
are
of
just
too
heavy
a
draught
to
navigate
such
waters
without
peril
if
indeed
they
could
enter
this
roadstead
at
all
for
there
is
a
bar
at
the
mouth
of
it
with
only
feet
at
high
water
spring
tides
the
former
built
as
they
were
with
a
view
to
manoeuvring
in
the
north
sea
are
just
within
the
margin
of
safety
east
holland
is
within
easy
striking
distance
of
the
manufacturing
districts
a
vigorous
raid
on
which
is
the
writer
urges
the
true
policy
of
an
invader
he
reports
positively
that
there
exist
in
a
proper
military
sense
no
preparations
whatever
to
meet
such
an
attack
east
holland
is
also
the
nearest
point
on
the
british
shores
to
germany
excepting
the
coast
of
norfolk
much
nearer
indeed
than
the
essex
flats
alluded
to
and
reached
by
a
simple
passage
without
any
dangerous
region
to
navigate
like
the
mouth
of
the
channel
and
the
estuary
of
the
thames
from
harwich
westwards
the
distance
is
west
by
south
roughly
from
borkum
island
and
from
wangeroog
the
time
estimated
for
transit
after
the
flotillas
had
been
assembled
outside
the
islands
is
from
thirty
to
hours
embarkation
is
the
next
topic
this
could
and
must
be
effected
in
one
tide
at
the
six
there
was
a
mean
period
of
two
and
a
half
hours
in
every
twelve
during
which
the
water
was
high
enough
at
norden
a
rather
longer
time
was
available
but
this
should
be
amply
sufficient
if
the
machinery
were
in
good
working
order
and
were
punctually
set
in
motion
high
water
occurs
approximately
at
the
same
time
at
all
seven
outlets
the
difference
between
the
two
farthest
apart
carolinensiel
and
greetsiel
being
only
half
an
hour
lastly
the
special
risks
attendant
on
such
an
expedition
are
dispassionately
weighed
x
though
keenly
anxious
to
recommend
his
scheme
writes
in
no
blindly
sanguine
spirit
there
are
no
modern
precedents
for
any
invasion
in
the
least
degree
comparable
to
that
of
england
by
germany
any
such
attempt
will
be
a
hazardous
experiment
but
he
argues
that
the
advantages
of
his
method
outweigh
the
risks
and
that
most
of
the
risks
themselves
would
attach
equally
to
any
other
method
whatever
skill
in
prediction
was
used
bad
weather
might
overtake
the
expedition
yes
but
if
transports
were
used
transhipment
into
boats
for
landing
would
in
bad
weather
be
fraught
with
the
same
and
a
greater
peril
but
transports
could
stand
off
and
wait
delay
is
fatal
in
any
case
unswerving
promptitude
is
the
essence
of
such
an
enterprise
the
lighters
would
be
in
danger
of
foundering
beside
the
point
if
the
end
is
worth
gaining
the
risks
must
be
faced
soldiers
lives
are
sacrificed
in
tens
of
thousands
on
battlefields
the
flotilla
would
be
demoralized
during
transit
by
the
assault
of
a
few
granted
but
the
same
would
apply
to
a
fleet
of
transports
with
the
added
certainty
that
one
lucky
shot
would
send
to
the
bottom
ten
times
the
number
of
soldiers
with
less
hope
of
rescue
in
both
cases
reliance
must
be
placed
on
the
efficiency
and
vigilance
of
the
escort
it
is
admitted
however
in
a
passage
which
might
well
make
my
two
adventurers
glow
with
triumph
that
if
by
any
mischance
the
british
discovered
what
was
afoot
in
good
time
and
were
able
to
send
over
a
swarm
of
boats
which
could
elude
the
german
warships
and
get
amongst
the
flotillas
while
they
were
still
in
process
of
leaving
the
siels
it
is
admitted
that
in
that
case
the
expedition
was
doomed
but
it
is
held
that
such
an
event
was
not
to
be
feared
reckless
pluck
is
abundant
in
the
british
navy
but
expert
knowledge
of
the
tides
and
shoals
in
these
waters
is
utterly
lacking
the
british
charts
are
of
no
value
and
there
is
no
evidence
he
reports
that
the
subject
has
been
studied
in
any
way
by
the
british
admiralty
let
me
remark
here
that
i
believe
mr
views
as
expressed
in
the
earlier
chapters
when
they
were
still
among
the
great
estuaries
are
all
absolutely
sound
the
theory
though
it
only
bore
indirectly
on
the
grand
issue
before
them
was
true
and
should
be
laid
to
heart
or
i
should
not
have
wasted
space
on
it
one
word
more
in
conclusion
there
is
an
axiom
much
in
fashion
now
that
there
is
no
fear
of
an
invasion
of
the
british
isles
because
if
we
lose
command
of
the
sea
we
can
be
starved
a
cheaper
and
surer
way
of
reducing
us
to
submission
it
is
a
loose
valueless
axiom
but
by
sheer
repetition
it
is
becoming
an
article
of
faith
it
implies
that
of
the
sea
is
a
thing
to
be
won
or
lost
definitely
that
we
may
have
it
and
lose
it
for
ever
on
the
contrary
the
chances
are
that
in
anything
like
an
even
struggle
the
command
of
the
sea
will
hang
in
the
balance
for
an
indefinite
time
and
even
against
great
odds
it
would
probably
be
impossible
for
our
enemies
so
to
bar
the
avenues
of
our
commerce
so
to
blockade
the
ports
of
our
extensive
and
so
to
overcome
the
interest
which
neutrals
will
have
in
supplying
us
as
to
bring
us
to
our
knees
in
less
than
two
years
during
which
time
we
can
be
recuperating
and
rebuilding
from
our
unique
internal
resources
and
endeavouring
to
regain
command
no
the
better
axiom
is
that
nothing
short
of
a
successful
invasion
could
finally
compel
us
to
make
peace
our
hearts
are
stout
we
hope
but
facts
are
facts
and
a
successful
raid
such
as
that
here
sketched
if
you
will
think
out
its
consequences
must
appal
the
stoutest
heart
it
was
checkmated
but
others
may
be
conceived
in
any
case
we
know
the
way
in
which
they
look
at
these
things
in
germany
postscript
march
it
so
happens
that
while
this
book
was
in
the
press
a
number
of
measures
have
been
taken
by
the
government
to
counteract
some
of
the
very
weaknesses
and
dangers
which
are
alluded
to
above
a
committee
of
national
defence
has
been
set
up
and
the
welcome
given
to
it
was
a
truly
extraordinary
comment
on
the
apathy
and
confusion
which
it
is
designed
to
supplant
a
site
on
the
forth
has
been
selected
for
a
new
north
sea
naval
base
an
excellent
if
tardy
decision
for
ten
years
or
so
must
elapse
before
the
existing
anchorage
becomes
in
any
sense
a
a
north
sea
fleet
has
also
been
created
another
good
measure
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
its
ships
are
not
modern
or
in
the
least
capable
of
meeting
the
principal
german
squadrons
under
the
circumstances
supposed
above
lastly
a
manning
committee
has
among
other
matters
reported
vaguely
in
favour
of
a
volunteer
reserve
there
is
no
means
of
knowing
what
this
recommendation
will
lead
to
let
us
hope
not
to
the
fiasco
of
the
last
badly
conceived
experiment
is
it
not
becoming
patent
that
the
time
has
come
for
training
all
englishmen
systematically
either
for
the
sea
or
for
the
rifle
