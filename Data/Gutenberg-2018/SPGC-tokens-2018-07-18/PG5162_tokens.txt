the

orchid
i
a
cry
on
the
hill
the
dance
was
over
from
the
great
house
on
the
hill
the
guests
had
all
departed
and
only
the
musicians
remained
as
they
filed
out
through
the
ample
doorway
on
their
way
home
the
first
faint
streak
of
early
dawn
became
visible
in
the
east
one
of
them
a
lank
young
man
of
ungainly
aspect
but
penetrating
eye
called
the
attention
of
the
others
to
it
look
said
he
there
is
the
daylight
this
has
been
a
gay
night
for
sutherlandtown
too
gay
muttered
another
starting
aside
as
the
slight
figure
of
a
young
man
coming
from
the
house
behind
them
rushed
hastily
by
why
who
that
as
they
one
and
all
had
recognised
the
person
thus
alluded
to
no
one
answered
till
he
had
dashed
out
of
the
gate
and
disappeared
in
the
woods
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
then
they
all
spoke
at
once
it
mr
frederick
he
seems
in
a
desperate
hurry
he
trod
on
my
toes
did
you
hear
the
words
he
was
muttering
as
he
went
by
as
only
the
last
question
was
calculated
to
rouse
any
interest
it
alone
received
attention
no
what
were
they
i
heard
him
say
something
but
i
failed
to
catch
the
words
he
was
talking
to
you
or
to
me
either
for
that
matter
but
i
have
ears
that
can
hear
an
eye
wink
he
said
god
this
night
of
horror
is
over
think
of
that
after
such
a
dance
and
such
a
spread
he
calls
the
night
horrible
and
thanks
god
that
it
is
over
i
thought
he
was
the
very
man
to
enjoy
this
kind
of
thing
so
did
i
and
so
did
i
the
five
musicians
exchanged
looks
then
huddled
in
a
group
at
the
gate
he
has
quarrelled
with
his
sweetheart
suggested
one
i
not
surprised
at
that
declared
another
i
never
thought
it
would
be
a
match
shame
if
it
were
muttered
the
ungainly
youth
who
had
spoken
first
as
the
subject
of
this
comment
was
the
son
of
the
gentleman
whose
house
they
were
just
leaving
they
necessarily
spoke
low
but
their
tones
were
rife
with
curiosity
and
it
was
evident
that
the
topic
deeply
interested
them
one
of
the
five
who
had
not
previously
spoken
now
put
in
a
word
i
saw
him
when
he
first
led
out
miss
page
to
dance
and
i
saw
him
again
when
he
stood
up
opposite
her
in
the
last
quadrille
and
i
tell
you
boys
there
was
a
mighty
deal
of
difference
in
the
way
he
conducted
himself
toward
her
in
the
beginning
of
the
evening
and
the
last
you
would
have
thought
him
the
same
man
reckless
young
fellows
like
him
are
not
to
be
caught
by
dimples
only
they
want
cash
or
family
at
least
and
she
has
either
but
what
a
pretty
girl
she
is
many
a
fellow
as
rich
as
he
and
as
well
connected
would
be
satisfied
with
her
good
looks
alone
good
looks
high
scorn
was
observable
in
this
exclamation
which
was
made
by
the
young
man
whom
i
have
before
characterised
as
ungainly
i
refuse
to
acknowledge
that
she
has
any
good
looks
on
the
contrary
i
consider
her
plain
oh
oh
burst
in
protest
from
more
than
one
mouth
and
why
does
she
have
every
fellow
in
the
room
dangling
after
her
then
asked
the
player
on
the
flageolet
she
has
a
regular
feature
what
difference
does
that
make
when
it
is
her
features
you
notice
but
herself
i
do
like
her
a
laugh
followed
this
that
wo
trouble
her
sweetwater
sutherland
does
if
you
do
and
that
much
more
to
the
point
and
he
marry
her
yet
he
ca
help
it
why
she
witch
the
devil
into
leading
her
to
the
altar
if
she
took
a
notion
to
have
him
for
her
bridegroom
there
would
be
consistency
in
that
muttered
the
fellow
just
addressed
but
frederick
hush
there
some
one
on
the
doorstep
why
it
she
they
all
glanced
back
the
graceful
figure
of
a
young
girl
dressed
in
white
was
to
be
seen
leaning
toward
them
from
the
open
doorway
behind
her
shone
a
blaze
of
light
the
candles
not
having
been
yet
extinguished
in
the
hall
and
against
this
brilliant
background
her
slight
form
with
all
its
bewitching
outlines
stood
out
in
plain
relief
who
was
that
she
began
in
a
high
almost
strident
voice
totally
out
of
keeping
with
the
sensuous
curves
of
her
strange
sweet
face
but
the
question
remained
unanswered
for
at
that
moment
her
attention
as
well
as
that
of
the
men
lingering
at
the
gate
was
attracted
by
the
sound
of
hurrying
feet
and
confused
cries
coming
up
the
hill
murder
murder
was
the
word
panted
out
by
more
than
one
harsh
voice
and
in
another
instant
a
dozen
men
and
boys
came
rushing
into
sight
in
a
state
of
such
excitement
that
the
five
musicians
recoiled
from
the
gate
and
one
of
them
went
so
far
as
to
start
back
toward
the
house
as
he
did
so
he
noticed
a
curious
thing
the
young
woman
whom
they
had
all
perceived
standing
in
the
door
a
moment
before
had
vanished
yet
she
was
known
to
possess
the
keenest
curiosity
of
any
one
in
town
murder
murder
a
terrible
and
unprecedented
cry
in
this
old
town
then
came
in
hoarse
explanation
from
the
jostling
group
as
they
stopped
at
the
gate
webb
has
been
killed
stabbed
with
a
knife
tell
mr
sutherland
webb
as
the
musicians
heard
this
name
so
honoured
and
so
universally
beloved
they
to
a
man
uttered
a
cry
webb
why
it
was
impossible
shouting
in
their
turn
for
sutherland
they
all
crowded
forward
not
mrs
webb
they
protested
who
could
have
the
daring
or
the
heart
to
kill
her
god
knows
answered
a
voice
from
the
highway
but
she
dead
just
seen
her
then
it
the
old
man
work
quavered
a
piping
voice
i
always
said
he
would
turn
on
his
best
friend
some
day
the
best
place
for
folks
as
has
lost
their
wits
i
but
here
a
hand
was
put
over
his
mouth
and
the
rest
of
the
words
was
lost
in
an
inarticulate
gurgle
sutherland
had
just
appeared
on
the
porch
he
was
a
man
with
an
expression
of
mingled
kindness
and
dignity
that
invariably
awakened
both
awe
and
admiration
in
the
spectator
no
man
in
the
country
i
was
going
to
say
no
woman
was
more
beloved
or
held
in
higher
esteem
yet
he
could
not
control
his
only
son
as
everyone
within
ten
miles
of
the
hill
well
knew
at
this
moment
his
face
showed
both
pain
and
shock
what
name
are
you
shouting
out
there
he
brokenly
demanded
agatha
webb
is
agatha
webb
hurt
yes
sir
killed
repeated
a
voices
at
once
we
just
come
from
the
house
all
the
town
is
up
some
say
her
husband
did
it
no
no
was
sutherland
decisive
though
response
philemon
webb
might
end
his
own
life
but
not
agatha
it
was
the
money
here
he
caught
himself
up
and
raising
his
voice
addressed
the
crowd
of
villagers
more
directly
wait
said
he
and
i
will
go
back
with
you
where
is
frederick
he
demanded
of
such
members
of
his
own
household
as
stood
about
him
no
one
knew
i
wish
some
one
would
find
my
son
i
want
him
to
go
into
town
with
me
he
over
in
the
woods
there
volunteered
a
voice
from
without
in
the
woods
repeated
the
father
in
a
surprised
tone
yes
sir
we
all
saw
him
go
shall
we
sing
out
to
him
no
no
i
will
manage
very
well
without
him
and
taking
up
his
hat
sutherland
stepped
out
again
upon
the
porch
suddenly
he
stopped
a
hand
had
been
laid
on
his
arm
and
an
insinuating
voice
was
murmuring
in
his
ear
do
you
mind
if
i
go
with
you
i
will
not
make
any
trouble
it
was
the
same
young
lady
we
have
seen
before
the
old
gentleman
frowned
he
who
never
frowned
and
remarked
shortly
a
scene
of
murder
is
no
place
for
women
the
face
upturned
to
his
remained
unmoved
i
think
i
will
go
she
quietly
persisted
i
can
easily
mingle
with
the
crowd
he
said
not
another
word
against
it
miss
page
was
under
pay
in
his
house
but
for
the
last
few
weeks
no
one
had
undertaken
to
contradict
her
in
the
interval
since
her
first
appearance
on
the
porch
she
had
exchanged
the
light
dress
in
which
she
had
danced
at
the
ball
for
a
darker
and
more
serviceable
one
and
perhaps
this
token
of
her
determination
may
have
had
its
influence
in
silencing
him
he
joined
the
crowd
and
together
they
moved
this
was
too
much
for
the
servants
of
the
house
one
by
one
they
too
left
the
house
till
it
stood
absolutely
empty
jerry
snuffed
out
the
candles
and
shut
the
front
door
but
the
side
entrance
stood
wide
open
and
into
this
entrance
as
the
last
footstep
died
out
on
the
hillside
passed
a
slight
and
resolute
figure
it
was
that
of
the
musician
who
had
questioned
miss
attractions
ii
one
night
work
sutherlandtown
was
a
seaport
the
village
which
was
a
small
one
consisted
of
one
long
street
and
numerous
cross
streets
running
down
from
the
hillside
and
ending
on
the
wharves
on
one
of
the
corners
thus
made
stood
the
webb
house
with
its
front
door
on
the
main
street
and
its
side
door
on
one
of
the
hillside
lanes
as
the
group
of
men
and
boys
who
had
been
in
search
of
sutherland
entered
this
lane
they
could
pick
out
this
house
from
all
the
others
as
it
was
the
only
one
in
which
a
light
was
still
burning
sutherland
lost
no
time
in
entering
upon
the
scene
of
tragedy
as
his
imposing
figure
emerged
from
the
darkness
and
paused
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
that
was
blocking
up
every
entrance
to
the
house
a
murmur
of
welcome
went
up
after
which
a
way
was
made
for
him
to
the
front
door
but
before
he
could
enter
some
one
plucked
him
by
the
sleeve
look
up
whispered
a
voice
into
his
ear
he
did
so
and
saw
a
woman
body
hanging
half
out
of
an
upper
window
it
hung
limp
and
the
sight
made
him
sick
notwithstanding
his
threescore
years
of
experience
who
that
he
cried
that
not
agatha
webb
no
that
batsy
the
cook
she
dead
as
well
as
her
mistress
we
left
her
where
we
found
her
for
the
coroner
to
see
but
this
is
horrible
murmured
sutherland
has
there
been
a
butcher
here
as
he
uttered
these
words
he
felt
another
quick
pressure
on
his
arm
looking
down
he
saw
leaning
against
him
the
form
of
a
young
woman
but
before
he
could
address
her
she
had
started
upright
again
and
was
moving
on
with
the
throng
it
was
miss
page
it
was
the
sight
of
this
woman
hanging
from
the
window
which
first
drew
attention
to
the
house
volunteered
a
man
who
was
standing
as
a
sort
of
guardian
at
the
main
gateway
some
of
the
sailors
wives
who
had
been
to
the
wharves
to
see
their
husbands
off
on
the
ship
that
sailed
at
daybreak
saw
it
as
they
came
up
the
lane
on
their
way
home
and
gave
the
alarm
without
that
we
might
not
have
known
to
this
hour
what
had
happened
but
mrs
webb
come
in
and
see
there
was
a
board
fence
about
the
simple
yard
within
which
stood
the
humble
house
forever
after
to
be
pointed
out
as
the
scene
of
sutherlandtown
most
tragedy
in
this
fence
was
a
gate
and
through
this
gate
now
passed
sutherland
followed
by
his
companion
miss
page
a
path
bordered
by
lilac
bushes
led
up
to
the
house
the
door
of
which
stood
wide
open
as
soon
as
sutherland
entered
upon
this
path
a
man
approached
him
from
the
doorway
it
was
amos
fenton
the
constable
ah
sutherland
said
he
sad
business
a
very
sad
business
but
what
little
girl
have
you
there
this
is
miss
page
my
housekeeper
niece
she
would
come
inquisitiveness
the
cause
i
do
not
approve
of
it
miss
page
must
remain
on
the
doorstep
we
allow
no
one
inside
excepting
yourself
he
said
respectfully
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
nothing
of
importance
was
ever
undertaken
in
sutherlandtown
without
the
presence
of
sutherland
miss
page
curtsied
looking
so
bewitching
in
the
fresh
morning
light
that
the
tough
old
constable
scratched
his
chin
in
grudging
admiration
but
he
did
not
reconsider
his
determination
seeing
this
she
accepted
her
defeat
gracefully
and
moved
aside
to
where
the
bushes
offered
her
more
or
less
protection
from
the
curiosity
of
those
about
her
meanwhile
sutherland
had
stepped
into
the
house
he
found
himself
in
a
small
hall
with
a
staircase
in
front
and
an
open
door
at
the
left
on
the
threshold
of
this
open
door
a
man
stood
who
at
sight
of
him
doffed
his
hat
passing
by
this
man
sutherland
entered
the
room
beyond
a
table
spread
with
eatables
met
his
view
beside
which
in
an
attitude
which
struck
him
at
the
moment
as
peculiar
sat
philemon
webb
the
master
of
the
house
astonished
at
seeing
his
old
friend
in
this
room
and
in
such
a
position
he
was
about
to
address
him
when
fenton
stopped
him
wait
said
he
take
a
look
at
poor
philemon
before
you
disturb
him
when
we
broke
into
the
house
a
ago
he
was
sitting
just
as
you
see
him
now
and
we
have
let
him
be
for
reasons
you
can
easily
appreciate
examine
him
closely
sutherland
he
wo
notice
it
but
what
ails
him
why
does
he
sit
crouched
against
the
table
is
he
hurt
too
no
look
at
his
eyes
sutherland
stooped
and
pushed
aside
the
long
grey
locks
that
half
concealed
the
countenance
of
his
aged
friend
why
he
cried
startled
they
are
closed
he
is
dead
no
he
is
asleep
asleep
yes
he
was
asleep
when
we
came
in
and
he
is
asleep
yet
some
of
the
neighbours
wanted
to
wake
him
but
i
would
not
let
them
his
wits
are
not
strong
enough
to
bear
a
sudden
shock
no
no
poor
philemon
but
that
he
should
sit
sleeping
here
while
she
but
what
do
these
bottles
mean
and
this
parade
of
supper
in
a
room
they
were
not
accustomed
to
eat
in
we
do
know
it
has
not
been
eaten
you
see
he
has
swallowed
a
glass
of
port
but
that
is
all
the
other
glasses
have
had
no
wine
in
them
nor
have
the
victuals
been
touched
seats
set
for
three
and
only
one
occupied
murmured
sutherland
strange
could
he
have
expected
guests
it
looks
like
it
i
did
know
that
his
wife
allowed
him
such
privileges
but
she
was
always
too
good
to
him
and
i
fear
has
paid
for
it
with
her
life
nonsense
he
never
killed
her
had
his
love
been
anything
short
of
the
worship
it
was
he
stood
in
too
much
awe
of
her
to
lift
his
hand
against
her
even
in
his
most
demented
moments
i
do
trust
men
of
uncertain
wits
returned
the
other
you
have
not
noticed
everything
that
is
to
be
seen
in
this
room
sutherland
recalled
to
himself
by
these
words
looked
quickly
about
him
with
the
exception
of
the
table
and
what
was
on
and
by
it
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
room
naturally
his
glance
returned
to
philemon
webb
i
do
see
anything
but
this
poor
sleeping
man
he
began
look
at
his
sleeve
sutherland
with
a
start
again
bent
down
the
arm
of
his
old
friend
lay
crooked
upon
the
table
and
on
its
blue
cotton
sleeve
there
was
a
smear
which
might
have
been
wine
but
which
was
blood
as
sutherland
became
assured
of
this
he
turned
slightly
pale
and
looked
inquiringly
at
the
two
men
who
were
intently
watching
him
this
is
bad
said
he
any
other
marks
of
blood
below
stairs
no
that
one
smear
is
all
oh
philemon
burst
from
sutherland
in
deep
emotion
then
as
he
looked
long
and
shudderingly
at
his
friend
he
added
slowly
he
has
been
in
the
room
where
she
was
killed
so
much
is
evident
but
that
he
understood
what
was
done
there
i
can
not
believe
or
he
would
not
be
sleeping
here
like
a
log
come
let
us
go
fenton
with
an
admonitory
gesture
toward
his
subordinate
turned
directly
toward
the
staircase
sutherland
followed
him
and
they
at
once
proceeded
to
the
upper
hall
and
into
the
large
front
room
which
had
been
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
it
was
the
parlour
or
of
this
small
and
unpretentious
house
a
rag
carpet
covered
the
floor
and
the
furniture
was
of
the
plainest
kind
but
the
woman
who
lay
outstretched
on
the
stiff
lounge
opposite
the
door
was
far
from
being
in
accord
with
the
homely
type
of
her
surroundings
though
the
victim
of
a
violent
death
her
face
and
form
both
of
a
beauty
seldom
to
be
found
among
women
of
any
station
were
so
majestic
in
their
calm
repose
that
sutherland
accustomed
as
he
was
to
her
noble
appearance
experienced
a
shock
of
surprise
that
found
vent
in
these
words
murdered
she
you
have
made
some
mistake
my
friends
look
at
her
face
but
even
in
the
act
of
saying
this
his
eyes
fell
on
the
blood
which
had
dyed
her
cotton
dress
and
he
cried
where
was
she
struck
and
where
is
the
weapon
which
has
made
this
ghastly
wound
she
was
struck
while
standing
or
sitting
at
this
table
returned
the
constable
pointing
to
two
or
three
drops
of
blood
on
its
smooth
surface
the
weapon
we
have
not
found
but
the
wound
shows
that
it
was
inflicted
by
a
dagger
a
dagger
yes
i
did
know
there
was
such
a
thing
in
town
philemon
could
have
had
no
dagger
it
does
not
seem
so
but
one
can
never
tell
simple
cottages
like
these
often
contain
the
most
articles
i
can
not
imagine
a
dagger
being
among
its
effects
declared
sutherland
where
was
the
body
of
webb
lying
when
you
came
in
where
you
see
it
now
nothing
has
been
moved
or
changed
she
was
found
here
on
this
lounge
in
the
same
position
in
which
we
see
her
now
yes
sir
but
that
is
incredible
look
at
the
way
she
lies
hands
crossed
eyes
closed
as
though
made
ready
for
her
burial
only
loving
hands
could
have
done
this
what
does
it
mean
it
means
philemon
that
is
what
it
means
philemon
sutherland
shuddered
but
said
nothing
he
was
dumbfounded
by
these
evidences
of
a
crazy
man
work
philemon
webb
always
seemed
so
harmless
though
he
had
been
failing
in
mind
for
the
last
ten
years
but
cried
sutherland
suddenly
rousing
there
is
another
victim
i
saw
old
woman
batsy
hanging
from
a
window
ledge
dead
yes
she
is
in
this
other
room
but
there
is
no
wound
on
batsy
how
was
she
killed
then
that
the
doctors
must
tell
us
sutherland
guided
by
fenton
gesture
entered
a
small
room
opening
into
the
one
in
which
they
stood
his
attention
was
at
once
attracted
by
the
body
of
the
woman
he
had
seen
from
below
lying
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
open
window
that
she
was
dead
was
evident
but
as
fenton
had
said
no
wound
was
to
be
seen
upon
her
nor
were
there
any
marks
of
blood
on
or
about
the
place
where
she
lay
this
is
a
dreadful
business
groaned
sutherland
the
worst
i
have
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
help
me
to
lift
the
woman
in
she
has
been
long
enough
a
show
for
the
people
outside
there
was
a
bed
in
this
room
indeed
it
was
webb
bedroom
and
upon
this
poor
batsy
was
laid
as
the
face
came
uppermost
both
gentlemen
started
and
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
the
expression
of
terror
and
alarm
which
it
showed
was
in
striking
contrast
to
the
look
of
exaltation
to
be
seen
on
the
face
of
her
dead
mistress
iii
the
empty
drawer
as
they
the
larger
room
they
were
astonished
to
come
upon
miss
page
standing
in
the
doorway
she
was
gazing
at
the
recumbent
figure
of
the
dead
woman
and
for
a
moment
seemed
unconscious
of
their
presence
how
did
you
get
in
which
of
my
men
was
weak
enough
to
let
you
pass
against
my
express
instructions
asked
the
constable
who
was
of
an
irritable
and
suspicious
nature
she
let
the
hood
drop
from
her
head
and
turning
surveyed
him
with
a
slow
smile
there
was
witchery
in
that
smile
sufficient
to
affect
a
much
more
cultivated
and
callous
nature
than
his
and
though
he
had
been
proof
against
it
once
he
could
not
quite
resist
the
effect
of
its
repetition
i
insisted
upon
entering
said
she
do
not
blame
the
men
they
did
not
want
to
use
force
against
a
woman
she
had
not
a
good
voice
and
she
knew
it
but
she
covered
up
this
defect
by
a
choice
of
intonations
that
carried
her
lightest
speech
to
the
heart
amos
fenton
gave
a
grunt
which
was
as
near
an
expression
of
approval
as
he
ever
gave
to
anyone
well
well
he
growled
but
not
it
a
morbid
curiosity
that
brings
you
here
better
drop
it
girl
it
wo
do
you
any
good
in
the
eyes
of
sensible
people
thank
you
was
her
demure
reply
her
lips
dimpling
at
the
corners
in
a
way
to
shock
the
sensitive
sutherland
glancing
from
her
to
the
still
outlines
of
the
noble
figure
on
the
couch
he
remarked
with
an
air
of
mild
reproof
i
do
not
understand
you
miss
page
if
this
solemn
sight
has
no
power
to
stop
your
coquetries
nothing
can
as
for
your
curiosity
it
is
both
and
unwomanly
let
me
see
you
leave
this
house
at
once
miss
page
and
if
in
the
few
hours
which
must
elapse
before
breakfast
you
can
find
time
to
pack
your
trunks
you
will
still
farther
oblige
me
oh
do
send
me
away
i
entreat
you
it
was
a
cry
from
her
inner
heart
which
she
probably
regretted
for
she
instantly
sought
to
cover
up
her
inadvertent
by
a
submissive
bend
of
the
head
and
a
step
backward
neither
fenton
nor
sutherland
seemed
to
hear
the
one
or
see
the
other
their
attention
having
returned
to
the
more
serious
matter
in
hand
the
dress
which
our
poor
friend
wears
shows
her
to
have
been
struck
before
retiring
commented
sutherland
after
another
short
survey
of
webb
figure
if
philemon
excuse
me
sir
interrupted
the
voice
of
the
young
man
who
had
been
left
in
the
hall
the
lady
is
listening
to
what
you
say
she
is
still
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
she
is
is
she
cried
fenton
sharply
his
admiration
for
the
fascinating
stranger
having
oozed
out
at
his
companion
rebuff
i
will
soon
show
her
but
the
words
melted
into
thin
air
as
he
reached
the
door
the
young
girl
had
disappeared
and
only
a
faint
perfume
remained
in
the
place
where
she
had
stood
a
most
extraordinary
person
grumbled
the
constable
turning
back
but
stopping
again
as
a
faint
murmur
came
up
from
below
the
gentleman
is
waking
called
up
a
voice
whose
lack
of
music
was
quite
perceptible
at
a
distance
with
a
bound
fenton
descended
the
stairs
followed
by
sutherland
miss
page
stood
before
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
sat
philemon
webb
as
they
reached
her
side
she
made
a
little
bow
that
was
half
mocking
half
deprecatory
and
slipped
from
the
house
an
almost
unbearable
sensation
of
incongruity
vanished
with
her
and
sutherland
for
one
breathed
like
a
man
relieved
i
wish
the
doctor
would
come
fenton
said
as
they
watched
the
slow
lifting
of
philemon
webb
head
our
fastest
rider
has
gone
for
him
but
he
out
portchester
way
and
it
may
be
an
hour
yet
before
he
can
get
here
philemon
sutherland
had
advanced
and
was
standing
by
his
old
friend
side
philemon
what
has
become
of
your
guests
you
waited
for
them
here
until
morning
the
old
man
with
a
dazed
look
surveyed
the
two
plates
set
on
either
side
of
him
and
shook
his
head
james
and
john
are
getting
proud
said
he
or
they
forget
they
forget
james
and
john
he
must
mean
the
zabels
yet
there
were
many
others
answering
to
these
names
in
town
sutherland
made
another
effort
philemon
where
is
your
wife
i
do
not
see
any
place
set
here
for
her
agatha
sick
agatha
cross
she
do
care
for
a
poor
old
man
like
me
agatha
dead
and
you
know
it
thundered
back
the
constable
with
severity
who
killed
her
tell
me
that
who
killed
her
a
sudden
quenching
of
the
last
spark
of
intelligence
in
the
old
eye
was
the
dreadful
effect
of
these
words
laughing
with
that
strange
gurgle
which
proclaims
an
utterly
irresponsible
mind
he
cried
the
pussy
cat
it
was
the
pussy
cat
who
killed
i
not
killed
let
go
to
jericho
sutherland
took
him
by
the
arm
and
led
him
perhaps
the
sight
of
his
dead
wife
would
restore
him
but
he
looked
at
her
with
the
same
indifference
he
showed
to
everything
else
i
do
like
her
calico
dresses
said
he
she
might
have
worn
silk
but
she
would
agatha
will
you
wear
silk
to
my
funeral
the
experiment
was
too
painful
and
they
drew
him
away
but
the
constable
curiosity
had
been
roused
and
after
they
had
found
some
one
to
take
care
of
him
he
drew
sutherland
aside
and
said
what
did
the
old
man
mean
by
saying
she
might
have
worn
silk
are
they
better
off
than
they
seem
sutherland
closed
the
door
before
replying
they
are
rich
he
declared
to
the
utter
amazement
of
the
other
that
is
they
were
but
they
may
have
been
robbed
if
so
philemon
was
not
the
wretch
who
killed
her
i
have
been
told
that
she
kept
her
money
in
an
cupboard
do
you
suppose
they
alluded
to
that
one
he
pointed
to
a
door
set
in
the
wall
over
the
fireplace
and
fenton
perceiving
a
key
sticking
in
the
lock
stepped
quickly
across
the
floor
and
opened
it
a
row
of
books
met
his
eyes
but
on
taking
them
down
a
couple
of
drawers
were
seen
at
the
back
are
they
locked
asked
sutherland
one
is
and
one
is
not
open
the
one
that
is
unlocked
fenton
did
so
it
is
empty
said
he
sutherland
cast
a
look
toward
the
dead
woman
and
again
the
perfect
serenity
of
her
countenance
struck
him
i
do
not
know
whether
to
regard
her
as
the
victim
of
her
imbecility
or
of
some
vile
robber
cupidity
can
you
find
the
key
to
the
other
drawer
i
will
try
suppose
you
begin
then
by
looking
on
her
person
it
should
be
in
her
pocket
if
no
marauder
has
been
here
it
is
not
in
her
pocket
hanging
to
her
neck
then
by
a
string
no
there
is
a
locket
here
but
no
key
a
very
handsome
locket
sutherland
with
a
child
lock
of
golden
hair
never
mind
we
will
see
that
later
it
is
the
key
we
want
just
now
good
heavens
what
is
it
it
is
in
her
hand
the
one
that
lies
underneath
ah
a
point
fenton
a
great
point
stand
by
her
fenton
do
let
anyone
rob
her
of
that
key
till
the
coroner
comes
and
we
are
at
liberty
to
take
it
i
will
not
leave
her
for
an
instant
meanwhile
i
will
put
back
these
books
he
had
scarcely
done
so
when
a
fresh
arrival
occurred
this
time
it
was
one
of
the
village
clergymen
iv
the
full
drawer
this
gentleman
had
some
information
to
give
it
seems
that
at
an
early
hour
of
this
same
night
he
had
gone
by
this
house
on
his
way
home
from
the
bedside
of
a
sick
parishioner
as
he
was
passing
the
gate
he
was
run
into
by
a
man
who
came
rushing
out
of
the
yard
in
a
state
of
violent
agitation
in
this
man
hand
was
something
that
glittered
and
though
the
encounter
nearly
upset
them
both
he
had
not
stopped
to
utter
an
apology
but
stumbled
away
out
of
sight
with
a
hasty
but
infirm
step
which
showed
he
was
neither
young
nor
active
the
minister
had
failed
to
see
his
face
but
noticed
the
ends
of
a
long
beard
blowing
over
his
shoulder
as
he
hurried
away
philemon
was
a
man
asked
if
he
could
give
the
time
of
this
encounter
he
replied
that
it
was
not
far
from
midnight
as
he
was
in
his
own
house
by
twelve
did
you
glance
up
at
these
windows
in
passing
asked
fenton
i
must
have
for
i
now
remember
they
were
both
lighted
were
the
shades
up
i
think
not
i
would
have
noticed
it
if
they
had
been
how
were
the
shades
when
you
broke
into
the
house
this
morning
inquired
sutherland
of
the
constable
just
as
they
are
now
we
have
moved
nothing
the
shades
were
both
down
one
of
them
over
an
open
window
well
we
may
find
this
encounter
of
yours
with
this
unknown
man
a
matter
of
vital
importance
mr
crane
i
wish
i
had
seen
his
face
what
do
you
think
the
object
was
you
saw
glittering
in
his
hand
i
should
not
like
to
say
i
saw
it
but
an
instant
could
it
have
been
a
knife
or
an
dagger
it
might
have
been
alas
poor
agatha
that
she
who
so
despised
money
should
fall
a
victim
to
man
cupidity
unhappy
life
unhappy
death
fenton
i
shall
always
mourn
for
agatha
webb
yet
she
seems
to
have
found
peace
at
last
observed
the
minister
i
have
never
seen
her
look
so
contented
and
leading
sutherland
aside
he
whispered
what
is
this
you
say
about
money
had
she
in
spite
of
appearances
any
considerable
amount
i
ask
because
in
spite
of
her
humble
home
and
simple
manner
of
living
she
always
put
more
on
the
plate
than
any
of
her
neighbours
besides
which
i
have
from
time
to
time
during
my
pastorate
received
anonymously
certain
contributions
which
as
they
were
always
for
sick
or
suffering
children
yes
yes
they
came
from
her
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
she
was
by
no
means
poor
though
i
myself
never
knew
the
extent
of
her
means
till
lately
philemon
was
a
good
business
man
once
but
they
evidently
preferred
to
live
simply
having
no
children
living
they
have
lost
six
i
have
been
told
so
the
portchester
folks
say
they
probably
had
no
heart
for
display
or
for
even
the
simplest
luxuries
at
all
events
they
did
not
indulge
in
them
philemon
has
long
been
past
indulging
in
anything
oh
he
likes
his
comfort
and
he
has
had
it
too
agatha
never
stinted
him
but
why
do
you
think
her
death
was
due
to
her
having
money
she
had
a
large
sum
in
the
house
and
there
are
those
in
town
who
knew
this
and
is
it
gone
that
we
shall
know
later
as
the
coroner
arrived
at
this
moment
the
minister
curiosity
had
to
wait
fortunately
for
his
equanimity
no
one
had
the
presumption
to
ask
him
to
leave
the
room
the
coroner
was
a
man
of
but
few
words
and
but
little
given
to
emotion
yet
they
were
surprised
at
his
first
question
who
is
the
young
woman
standing
outside
there
the
only
one
in
the
yard
sutherland
moving
rapidly
to
the
window
drew
aside
the
shade
it
is
miss
page
my
housekeeper
niece
he
explained
i
do
not
understand
her
interest
in
this
affair
she
followed
me
here
from
the
house
and
could
hardly
be
got
to
leave
this
room
into
which
she
intruded
herself
against
my
express
command
but
look
at
her
attitude
it
was
fenton
who
spoke
she
crazier
than
philemon
it
seems
to
me
there
was
some
reason
for
this
remark
guarded
by
the
high
fence
from
the
gaze
of
the
pushing
crowd
without
she
stood
upright
and
immovable
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
like
one
on
watch
the
hood
which
she
had
dropped
from
her
head
when
she
thought
her
eyes
and
smile
might
be
of
use
to
her
in
the
furtherance
of
her
plans
had
been
drawn
over
it
again
so
that
she
looked
more
like
a
statue
in
grey
than
a
living
breathing
woman
yet
there
was
menace
in
her
attitude
and
a
purpose
in
the
solitary
stand
she
took
in
that
circle
of
grass
which
caused
a
thrill
in
the
breasts
of
those
who
looked
at
her
from
that
chamber
of
death
a
mysterious
young
woman
muttered
the
minister
and
one
that
i
neither
countenance
nor
understand
interpolated
sutherland
i
have
just
shown
my
displeasure
at
her
actions
by
dismissing
her
from
my
house
the
coroner
gave
him
a
quick
look
seemed
about
to
speak
but
changed
his
mind
and
turned
toward
the
dead
woman
we
have
a
sad
duty
before
us
said
he
the
investigations
which
followed
elicited
one
or
two
new
facts
first
that
all
the
doors
of
the
house
were
found
unlocked
and
secondly
that
the
constable
had
been
among
the
first
to
enter
so
that
he
could
vouch
that
no
disarrangement
had
been
made
in
the
rooms
with
the
exception
of
batsy
removal
to
the
bed
then
his
attention
being
drawn
to
the
dead
woman
he
discovered
the
key
in
her
tightly
closed
hand
where
does
this
key
belong
he
asked
they
showed
him
the
drawers
in
the
cupboard
one
is
empty
remarked
mi
sutherland
if
the
other
is
found
to
be
in
the
same
condition
then
her
money
has
been
taken
that
key
she
holds
should
open
both
these
drawers
then
let
it
be
made
use
of
at
once
it
is
important
that
we
should
know
whether
theft
has
been
committed
here
as
well
as
murder
and
drawing
the
key
out
he
handed
it
to
fenton
the
constable
immediately
unlocked
the
drawer
and
brought
it
and
its
contents
to
the
table
no
money
here
said
he
but
papers
as
good
as
money
announced
the
doctor
see
here
are
deeds
and
more
than
one
valuable
bond
i
judge
she
was
a
richer
woman
than
any
of
us
knew
sutherland
meantime
was
looking
with
an
air
of
disappointment
into
the
now
empty
drawer
just
as
i
feared
said
he
she
has
been
robbed
of
her
ready
money
it
was
doubtless
in
the
other
drawer
how
came
she
by
the
key
then
that
is
one
of
the
mysteries
of
the
affair
this
murder
is
by
no
means
a
simple
one
i
begin
to
think
we
shall
find
it
full
of
mysteries
batsy
death
for
instance
o
yes
batsy
i
forgot
that
she
was
found
dead
too
without
a
wound
doctor
she
had
heart
disease
i
doctored
her
for
it
the
fright
has
killed
her
the
look
of
her
face
confirms
that
let
me
see
so
it
does
but
we
must
have
an
autopsy
to
prove
it
i
would
like
to
explain
before
any
further
measures
are
taken
how
i
came
to
know
that
agatha
webb
had
money
in
her
house
said
sutherland
as
they
stepped
back
into
the
other
room
two
days
ago
as
i
was
sitting
with
my
family
at
table
old
gossip
judy
came
in
had
sutherland
been
living
this
old
crone
would
not
have
presumed
to
intrude
upon
us
at
mealtime
but
as
we
have
no
one
now
to
uphold
our
dignity
this
woman
rushed
into
our
presence
panting
with
news
and
told
us
all
in
one
breath
how
she
had
just
come
from
webb
that
webb
had
money
that
she
had
seen
it
she
herself
that
going
into
the
house
as
usual
without
knocking
she
had
heard
agatha
stepping
overhead
and
had
gone
up
and
finding
the
door
of
the
ajar
had
looked
in
and
seen
agatha
crossing
the
room
with
her
hands
full
of
bills
that
these
bills
were
big
bills
for
she
heard
agatha
cry
as
she
locked
them
up
in
the
cupboard
behind
the
thousand
dollars
that
is
too
much
money
to
have
in
one
house
that
she
judy
thought
so
too
and
being
frightened
at
what
she
had
seen
had
crept
away
as
silently
as
she
had
entered
and
run
away
to
tell
the
neighbours
happily
i
was
the
first
she
found
up
that
morning
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
spite
of
my
express
injunctions
she
has
since
related
the
news
to
half
the
people
in
town
was
the
young
woman
down
yonder
present
when
judy
told
this
story
asked
the
coroner
pointing
towards
the
yard
sutherland
pondered
possibly
i
do
not
remember
frederick
was
seated
at
the
table
with
me
and
my
housekeeper
was
pouring
out
the
coffee
but
it
was
early
for
miss
page
she
has
been
putting
on
great
airs
of
late
can
it
be
possible
he
is
trying
to
blind
himself
to
the
fact
that
his
son
frederick
wishes
to
marry
this
girl
muttered
the
clergyman
into
the
constable
ear
the
constable
shook
his
head
sutherland
was
one
of
those
debonair
men
whose
very
mildness
makes
them
impenetrable
v
a
spot
on
the
lawn
the
coroner
on
leaving
the
house
was
followed
by
sutherland
as
the
fine
figures
of
the
two
men
appeared
on
the
doorstep
a
faint
cheer
was
heard
from
the
two
or
three
favoured
persons
who
were
allowed
to
look
through
the
gate
but
to
this
token
of
welcome
neither
gentleman
responded
by
so
much
as
a
look
all
their
attention
being
engrossed
by
the
sight
of
the
solitary
figure
of
miss
page
who
still
held
her
stand
upon
the
lawn
motionless
as
a
statue
but
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
their
faces
she
awaited
their
approach
when
they
were
near
her
she
thrust
one
hand
from
under
her
cloak
and
pointing
to
the
grass
at
her
feet
said
quietly
see
this
they
hastened
towards
her
and
bent
down
to
examine
the
spot
she
indicated
what
do
you
find
there
cried
sutherland
whose
eyesight
was
not
good
blood
responded
the
coroner
plucking
up
a
blade
of
grass
and
surveying
it
closely
blood
echoed
miss
page
with
so
suggestive
a
glance
that
sutherland
stared
at
her
in
amazement
not
understanding
his
own
emotion
how
were
you
able
to
discern
a
stain
so
nearly
imperceptible
asked
the
coroner
imperceptible
it
is
the
only
thing
i
see
in
the
whole
yard
she
retorted
and
with
a
slight
bow
which
was
not
without
its
element
of
mockery
she
turned
toward
the
gate
a
most
unaccountable
girl
commented
the
doctor
but
she
is
right
about
these
stains
abel
he
called
to
the
man
at
the
gate
bring
a
box
or
barrel
here
and
cover
up
this
spot
i
do
want
it
disturbed
by
trampling
feet
abel
started
to
obey
just
as
the
young
girl
laid
her
hand
on
the
gate
to
open
it
wo
you
help
me
she
asked
the
crowd
is
so
great
they
wo
let
me
through
wo
they
the
words
came
from
without
just
slip
out
as
i
slip
in
and
you
find
a
place
made
for
you
not
recognising
the
voice
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
but
seeing
the
gate
swaying
she
pushed
against
it
just
as
a
young
man
stepped
through
the
gap
necessarily
they
came
face
to
face
ah
it
you
he
muttered
giving
her
a
sharp
glance
i
do
not
know
you
she
haughtily
declared
and
slipped
by
him
with
such
dexterity
she
was
out
of
the
gate
before
he
could
respond
but
he
only
snapped
his
finger
and
thumb
mockingly
at
her
and
smiled
knowingly
at
abel
who
had
lingered
to
watch
the
end
of
this
encounter
supple
as
a
willow
twig
eh
he
laughed
well
i
have
made
whistles
out
of
willows
before
now
and
hallo
where
did
you
get
that
he
was
pointing
to
a
rare
flower
that
hung
limp
and
faded
from
buttonhole
this
oh
i
found
it
in
the
house
yonder
it
was
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
inner
room
almost
under
batsy
skirts
curious
sort
of
flower
i
wonder
where
she
got
it
the
intruder
betrayed
at
once
an
unaccountable
emotion
there
was
a
strange
glitter
in
his
light
green
eyes
that
made
abel
shift
rather
uneasily
on
his
feet
was
that
before
this
pretty
minx
you
have
just
let
out
came
in
here
with
mr
sutherland
o
yes
before
anyone
had
started
for
the
hill
at
all
why
what
has
this
young
lady
got
to
do
with
a
flower
dropped
by
batsy
she
nothing
only
and
i
have
never
given
you
bad
advice
abel
let
that
thing
hang
any
longer
from
your
buttonhole
put
it
into
an
envelope
and
keep
it
and
if
you
do
hear
from
me
again
in
regard
to
it
write
me
out
a
fool
and
forget
we
were
ever
chums
when
little
shavers
the
man
called
abel
smiled
took
out
the
flower
and
went
to
cover
up
the
grass
as
talbot
had
requested
the
stranger
took
his
place
at
the
gate
toward
which
the
coroner
and
sutherland
were
now
advancing
with
an
air
that
showed
his
great
anxiety
to
speak
with
them
he
was
the
musician
whom
we
saw
secretly
entering
the
gentleman
house
after
the
departure
of
the
servants
as
the
coroner
paused
before
him
he
spoke
talbot
said
he
dropping
his
eyes
which
were
apt
to
betray
his
thoughts
too
plainly
you
have
often
promised
that
you
would
give
me
a
job
if
any
matter
came
up
where
any
nice
detective
work
was
wanted
do
you
think
the
time
has
come
to
remember
me
you
sweetwater
i
afraid
the
affair
is
too
deep
for
an
inexperienced
man
first
effort
i
shall
have
to
send
to
boston
for
an
expert
another
time
sweetwater
when
the
complications
are
less
serious
the
young
fellow
with
a
face
white
as
milk
was
turning
away
but
you
let
me
stay
around
here
he
pleaded
pausing
and
giving
the
other
an
imploring
look
o
yes
answered
the
coroner
fenton
will
have
work
enough
for
you
and
half
a
dozen
others
go
and
tell
him
i
sent
you
thank
you
returned
the
other
his
face
suddenly
losing
its
aspect
of
acute
disappointment
now
i
shall
see
where
that
flower
fell
he
murmured
vi
breakfast
is
served
gentlemen
sutherland
returned
home
as
he
entered
the
broad
hall
he
met
his
son
frederick
there
was
a
look
on
the
young
man
face
such
as
he
had
not
seen
there
in
years
father
faltered
the
youth
may
i
have
a
few
words
with
you
the
father
nodded
kindly
though
it
is
likely
he
would
have
much
preferred
his
breakfast
and
the
young
man
led
him
into
a
little
littered
with
the
faded
garlands
and
other
tokens
of
the
preceding
night
festivities
i
have
an
apology
to
make
frederick
began
or
rather
i
have
your
forgiveness
to
ask
for
years
he
went
on
stumbling
over
his
words
though
he
gave
no
evidence
of
a
wish
to
restrain
them
for
years
i
have
gone
contrariwise
to
your
wishes
and
caused
my
mother
heart
to
ache
and
you
to
wish
i
had
never
been
born
to
be
a
curse
to
you
and
her
he
had
emphasised
the
word
mother
and
spoke
altogether
with
force
and
deep
intensity
sutherland
stood
petrified
he
had
long
ago
given
up
this
lad
as
lost
i
i
wish
to
change
i
wish
to
be
as
great
a
pride
to
you
as
i
have
been
a
shame
and
a
dishonour
i
may
not
succeed
at
once
but
i
am
in
earnest
and
if
you
will
give
me
your
hand
the
old
man
arms
were
round
the
young
man
shoulders
at
once
frederick
he
cried
my
frederick
do
not
make
me
too
much
ashamed
murmured
the
youth
very
pale
and
strangely
discomposed
with
no
excuse
for
my
past
i
suffer
intolerable
apprehension
in
regard
to
my
future
lest
my
good
intentions
should
fail
or
my
not
hold
out
but
the
knowledge
that
you
are
acquainted
with
my
resolve
and
regard
it
with
an
undeserved
sympathy
may
suffice
to
sustain
me
and
i
should
certainly
be
a
base
poltroon
if
i
should
disappoint
you
or
her
twice
he
paused
drew
himself
from
his
father
arms
and
glanced
almost
solemnly
out
of
the
window
i
swear
that
i
will
henceforth
act
as
if
she
were
still
alive
and
watching
me
there
was
strange
intensity
in
his
manner
sutherland
regarded
him
with
amazement
he
had
seen
him
in
every
mood
natural
to
a
reckless
man
but
never
in
so
serious
a
one
never
with
a
look
of
awe
or
purpose
in
his
face
it
gave
him
quite
a
new
idea
of
frederick
yes
the
young
man
went
on
raising
his
right
hand
but
not
removing
his
eyes
from
the
distant
prospect
on
which
they
were
fixed
i
swear
that
i
will
henceforth
do
nothing
to
discredit
her
memory
outwardly
and
inwardly
i
will
act
as
though
her
eye
were
still
upon
me
and
she
could
again
suffer
grief
at
my
failures
or
thrill
with
pleasure
at
my
success
a
portrait
of
sutherland
painted
when
frederick
was
a
lad
of
ten
hung
within
a
few
feet
of
him
as
he
spoke
he
did
not
glance
at
it
but
sutherland
did
and
with
a
look
as
if
he
expected
to
behold
a
responsive
light
beam
from
those
pathetic
features
she
loved
you
very
dearly
was
his
slow
and
earnest
comment
we
have
both
loved
you
much
more
deeply
than
you
have
ever
seemed
to
realise
frederick
i
believe
it
responded
the
young
man
turning
with
an
expression
of
calm
resolve
to
meet
his
father
eye
as
proof
that
i
am
no
longer
insensible
to
your
affection
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
forego
for
your
sake
one
of
the
dearest
wishes
of
my
heart
father
he
hesitated
before
he
spoke
the
word
but
he
spoke
it
firmly
at
last
am
i
right
in
thinking
you
would
not
like
miss
page
for
a
daughter
like
my
housekeeper
niece
to
take
the
place
in
this
house
once
occupied
by
marietta
sutherland
frederick
i
have
always
thought
too
well
of
you
to
believe
you
would
carry
your
forgetfulness
of
me
so
far
as
that
even
when
i
saw
that
you
were
influenced
by
her
attractions
you
did
not
do
justice
to
my
selfishness
father
i
did
mean
to
marry
her
but
i
have
given
up
living
solely
for
myself
and
she
could
never
help
me
to
live
for
others
father
amabel
page
must
not
remain
in
this
house
to
cause
division
between
you
and
me
i
have
already
intimated
to
her
the
desirability
of
her
quitting
a
home
where
she
is
no
longer

the
old
gentleman
declared
she
leaves
on
the
train
her
conduct
this
morning
at
the
house
of
webb
who
perhaps
you
do
not
know
was
most
cruelly
and
foully
murdered
last
night
was
such
as
to
cause
comment
and
make
her
an
undesirable
adjunct
to
any
gentleman
family
frederick
paled
something
in
these
words
had
caused
him
a
great
shock
sutherland
was
fond
enough
to
believe
that
it
was
the
news
of
this
extraordinary
woman
death
but
his
son
words
as
soon
as
he
could
find
any
showed
that
his
mind
was
running
on
amabel
whom
he
perhaps
had
found
it
difficult
to
connect
even
in
the
remotest
way
with
crime
she
at
this
place
of
death
how
could
that
be
who
would
take
a
young
girl
there
the
father
experiencing
perhaps
more
compassion
for
this
lover
than
he
thought
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
show
answered
shortly
but
without
any
compromise
of
the
unhappy
truth
she
went
she
was
not
taken
no
one
not
even
myself
could
keep
her
back
after
she
had
heard
that
a
murder
had
been
committed
in
the
town
she
even
intruded
into
the
house
and
when
ordered
out
of
the
room
of
death
took
up
her
stand
in
the
yard
in
front
where
she
remained
until
she
had
the
opportunity
of
pointing
out
to
us
a
stain
of
blood
on
the
grass
which
might
otherwise
have
escaped
our
attention
impossible
frederick
eye
was
staring
he
looked
like
a
man
struck
dumb
by
surprise
or
fear
amabel
do
this
you
are
mocking
me
sir
or
i
may
be
dreaming
which
may
the
good
god
grant
his
father
who
had
not
looked
for
so
much
emotion
eyed
his
son
in
surprise
which
rapidly
changed
to
alarm
as
the
young
man
faltered
and
fell
back
against
the
wall
you
are
ill
frederick
you
are
really
let
me
call
down
harcourt
but
no
i
can
not
summon
her
she
is
this
girl
aunt
frederick
made
an
effort
and
stood
up
do
not
call
anybody
he
entreated
i
expect
to
suffer
some
in
casting
this
fascinating
girl
out
of
my
heart
ultimately
i
will
conquer
the
weakness
indeed
i
will
as
for
her
interest
in
webb
death
how
low
his
voice
sank
and
how
he
trembled
she
may
have
been
better
friends
with
her
than
we
had
any
reason
to
suppose
i
can
think
of
no
other
motive
for
her
conduct
admiration
for
webb
and
horror
breakfast
is
served
gentlemen
cried
a
thrilling
voice
behind
them
amabel
page
stood
smiling
in
the
doorway
vii
marry
me
wait
a
moment
i
must
speak
to
you
it
was
amabel
who
was
holding
frederick
back
she
had
caught
him
by
the
arm
as
he
was
about
leaving
the
room
with
his
father
and
he
felt
himself
obliged
to
stop
and
listen
i
start
for
springfield
she
announced
i
have
another
relative
there
living
at
the
house
when
shall
i
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
in
my
new
home
never
it
was
said
regretfully
and
yet
with
a
certain
brusqueness
occasioned
perhaps
by
feeling
hard
as
it
is
for
me
to
say
it
amabel
it
is
but
just
for
me
to
tell
you
that
after
our
parting
here
we
will
meet
only
as
strangers
friendship
between
us
would
be
mockery
and
any
closer
relationship
has
become
impossible
it
had
cost
him
an
immense
effort
to
say
these
words
and
he
expected
fondly
expected
i
must
admit
to
see
her
colour
change
and
her
head
droop
but
instead
of
this
she
looked
at
him
steadily
for
a
moment
then
slipped
her
hand
down
his
arm
till
she
reached
his
palm
which
she
pressed
with
sudden
warmth
drawing
him
into
the
room
as
she
did
so
and
shutting
the
door
behind
them
he
was
speechless
for
she
never
had
looked
so
handsome
or
so
glowing
instead
of
showing
depression
or
humiliation
even
she
confronted
him
with
a
smile
more
dangerous
than
any
display
of
grief
for
it
contained
what
it
had
hitherto
lacked
positive
and
irresistible
admiration
her
words
were
equally
dangerous
i
kiss
your
hand
as
the
spaniards
say
and
she
almost
did
so
with
a
bend
of
her
head
which
just
allowed
him
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
two
startling
dimples
he
was
astounded
he
thought
he
knew
this
woman
well
but
at
this
moment
she
was
as
incomprehensible
to
him
as
if
he
had
never
made
a
study
of
her
caprices
and
sought
an
explanation
for
her
expressions
i
am
sensible
of
the
honour
said
he
but
hardly
understand
how
i
have
earned
it
still
that
incomprehensible
look
of
admiration
continued
to
illumine
her
face
i
did
not
know
i
could
ever
think
so
well
of
you
she
declared
if
you
do
not
take
care
i
shall
end
by
loving
you
some
day
ah
he
ejaculated
his
face
contracting
with
sudden
pain
your
love
then
is
but
a
potentiality
very
well
amabel
keep
it
so
and
you
will
be
spared
much
misery
as
for
me
who
have
not
been
as
wise
as
you
frederick
she
had
come
so
near
he
did
not
have
the
strength
to
finish
her
face
with
its
indefinable
charm
was
raised
to
his
as
she
dropped
these
words
one
by
one
from
her
lips
in
lingering
cadence
frederick
do
you
love
me
then
so
very
much
he
was
angry
possibly
because
he
felt
his
resolution
failing
him
you
know
he
hotly
began
stepping
back
then
with
a
sudden
burst
of
feeling
that
was
almost
like
prayer
he
resumed
do
not
tempt
me
amabel
i
have
trouble
enough
without
lamenting
the
failure
of
my
first
steadfast
purpose
ah
she
said
stopping
where
she
was
but
drawing
him
toward
her
by
every
witchery
of
which
her
mobile
features
were
capable
your
generous
impulse
has
strengthened
into
a
purpose
has
it
well
i
not
worth
it
frederick
more
and
more
astounded
understanding
her
less
than
ever
but
charmed
by
looks
that
would
have
moved
an
anchorite
he
turned
his
head
away
in
a
vain
attempt
to
escape
an
influence
that
was
so
rapidly
undermining
his
determination
she
saw
the
movement
recognised
the
weakness
it
bespoke
and
in
the
triumph
of
her
heart
allowed
a
low
laugh
to
escape
her
her
voice
as
i
have
before
said
was
unmusical
though
effective
but
her
laugh
was
deliciously
sweet
especially
when
it
was
restrained
to
a
mere
ripple
as
now
you
will
come
to
springfield
soon
she
avowed
slipping
from
before
him
so
as
to
leave
the
way
to
the
door
open
amabel
his
voice
was
strangely
husky
and
the
involuntary
opening
and
shutting
of
his
hands
revealed
the
emotion
under
which
he
was
labouring
do
you
love
me
you
have
acknowledged
it
now
and
then
but
always
as
if
you
did
not
mean
it
now
you
acknowledge
that
you
may
some
day
and
this
time
as
if
you
did
mean
it
what
is
the
truth
tell
me
without
coquetry
or
dissembling
for
i
am
in
dead
earnest
and
he
paused
choked
and
turned
toward
the
window
where
but
a
few
minutes
before
he
had
taken
that
solemn
oath
the
remembrance
of
it
seemed
to
come
back
with
the
movement
flushing
with
a
new
agitation
he
wheeled
upon
her
sharply
no
no
he
prayed
say
nothing
if
you
swore
you
did
not
love
me
i
should
not
believe
it
and
if
you
swore
that
you
did
i
should
only
find
it
harder
to
repeat
what
must
again
be
said
that
a
union
between
us
can
never
take
place
i
have
given
my
solemn
promise
to
well
well
why
do
you
stop
am
i
so
hard
to
talk
to
that
the
words
will
not
leave
your
lips
i
have
promised
my
father
i
will
never
marry
you
he
feels
that
he
has
grounds
of
complaint
against
you
and
as
i
owe
him
everything
he
stopped
amazed
she
was
looking
at
him
intently
that
same
low
laugh
still
on
her
lips
tell
the
truth
she
whispered
i
know
to
what
extent
you
consider
your
father
wishes
you
think
you
ought
not
to
marry
me
after
what
took
place
last
night
frederick
i
like
you
for
this
evidence
of
consideration
on
your
part
but
do
not
struggle
too
relentlessly
with
your
conscience
i
can
forgive
much
more
in
you
than
you
think
and
if
you
really
love
me
stop
let
us
understand
each
other
he
had
turned
mortally
pale
and
met
her
eyes
with
something
akin
to
alarm
what
do
you
allude
to
in
speaking
of
last
night
i
did
not
know
there
was
anything
said
by
us
in
our
talk
together
i
do
not
allude
to
our
talk
or
or
in
the
one
dance
we
had
frederick
a
dance
is
innocent
the
word
seemed
to
strike
him
with
the
force
of
a
blow
innocent
he
repeated
innocent
becoming
paler
still
as
the
full
weight
of
her
meaning
broke
gradually
upon
him
i
followed
you
into
town
she
whispered
coming
closer
and
breathing
the
words
into
his
ear
but
what
i
saw
you
do
there
will
not
prevent
me
from
obeying
you
if
you
say
me
wherever
i
go
amabel
henceforth
our
lives
are
one
my
god
it
was
all
he
said
but
it
seemed
to
create
a
gulf
between
them
in
the
silence
that
followed
the
evil
spirit
latent
beneath
her
beauty
began
to
make
itself
evident
even
in
the
smile
which
no
longer
called
into
view
the
dimples
which
belong
to
guileless
mirth
while
upon
his
face
after
the
first
paralysing
effect
of
her
words
had
passed
there
appeared
an
expression
of
manly
resistance
that
betrayed
a
virtue
which
as
yet
had
never
appeared
in
his
selfish
and
altogether
reckless
life
that
this
was
more
than
a
passing
impulse
he
presently
made
evident
by
lifting
his
hand
and
pushing
her
slowly
back
i
do
not
know
what
you
saw
me
do
said
he
but
whatever
it
was
it
can
make
no
difference
in
our
relations
her
whisper
which
had
been
but
a
breath
before
became
scarcely
audible
i
did
not
pause
at
the
gate
you
entered
said
she
i
went
in
after
you
a
gasp
of
irresistible
feeling
escaped
him
but
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
her
face
it
was
a
long
time
before
you
came
out
she
went
on
but
previous
to
that
time
the
shade
of
a
certain
window
was
thrust
aside
and
hush
he
commanded
in
uncontrollable
passion
pressing
his
hand
with
impulsive
energy
against
her
mouth
not
another
word
of
that
or
i
shall
forget
you
are
a
woman
or
that
i
have
ever
loved
you
her
eyes
which
were
all
she
had
remaining
to
plead
with
took
on
a
peculiar
look
of
quiet
satisfaction
and
power
seeing
it
he
let
his
hand
fall
and
for
the
first
time
began
to
regard
her
with
anything
but
a
lover
eyes
i
was
the
only
person
in
sight
at
that
time
she
continued
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
world
at
large
fear
the
word
made
its
own
echo
she
had
no
need
to
emphasise
it
even
by
a
smile
but
she
watched
him
as
it
sunk
into
his
consciousness
with
an
intentness
it
took
all
his
strength
to
sustain
suddenly
her
bearing
and
expression
changed
the
few
remains
of
sweetness
in
her
face
vanished
and
even
the
allurement
which
often
lasts
when
the
sweetness
is
gone
disappeared
in
the
energy
which
now
took
possession
of
her
whole
threatening
and
inflexible
personality
marry
me
she
cried
or
i
will
proclaim
you
to
be
the
murderer
of
agatha
webb
she
had
seen
the
death
of
love
in
his
eyes
viii
a
devil
that
understands
men
frederick
sutherland
was
a
man
of
finer
mental
balance
than
he
himself
perhaps
had
ever
realised
after
the
first
few
moments
of
stupefaction
following
the
astounding
alternative
which
had
been
given
him
he
broke
out
with
the
last
sentence
she
probably
expected
to
hear
what
do
you
hope
from
a
marriage
with
me
that
to
attain
your
wishes
you
thus
sacrifice
every
womanly
instinct
she
met
him
on
his
own
ground
what
do
i
hope
she
actually
glowed
with
the
force
of
her
secret
desire
can
you
ask
a
poor
girl
like
me
born
in
a
tenement
house
but
with
tastes
and
ambitions
such
as
are
usually
only
given
to
those
who
can
gratify
them
i
want
to
be
the
rich
sutherland
daughter
acknowledged
or
unacknowledged
the
wife
of
one
who
can
enter
any
house
in
boston
as
an
equal
with
a
position
like
that
i
can
rise
to
anything
i
feel
that
i
have
the
natural
power
and
aptitude
i
have
felt
it
since
i
was
a
small
child
and
for
that
he
began
and
for
that
she
broke
in
i
am
quite
willing
to
overlook
a
blot
on
your
record
confident
that
you
will
never
repeat
the
risk
of
last
night
i
am
ready
to
share
the
burden
of
your
secret
through
life
if
you
treat
me
well
i
am
sure
i
can
make
that
burden
light
for
you
with
a
quick
flush
and
an
increase
of
probably
not
anticipated
by
her
he
faced
the
daring
girl
with
a
desperate
resolution
that
showed
how
handsome
he
could
be
if
his
soul
once
got
control
of
his
body
woman
he
cried
they
were
right
you
are
little
less
than
a
devil
did
she
regard
it
as
a
compliment
her
smile
would
seem
to
say
so
a
devil
that
understands
men
she
answered
with
that
slow
dip
of
her
dimples
that
made
her
smile
so
dangerous
you
will
not
hesitate
long
over
this
matter
a
week
perhaps
i
shall
not
hesitate
at
all
seeing
you
as
you
are
makes
my
course
easy
you
will
never
share
any
burden
with
me
as
my
wife
still
she
was
not
abashed
it
is
a
pity
she
whispered
it
would
have
saved
you
such
unnecessary
struggle
but
a
week
is
not
long
to
wait
i
am
certain
of
you
then
this
day
week
at
twelve
frederick
he
seized
her
by
the
arm
and
lost
to
everything
but
his
rage
shook
her
with
a
desperate
hand
do
you
mean
it
he
cried
a
sudden
horror
showing
itself
in
his
face
notwithstanding
his
efforts
to
conceal
it
i
mean
it
so
much
she
assured
him
that
before
i
came
home
just
now
i
paid
a
visit
to
the
copse
over
the
way
a
certain
hollow
tree
where
you
and
i
have
held
more
than
one
tryst
conceals
within
its
depths
a
package
containing
over
one
thousand
dollars
frederick
i
hold
your
life
in
my
hands
the
grasp
with
which
he
held
her
relaxed
a
mortal
despair
settled
upon
his
features
and
recognising
the
impossibility
of
further
concealing
the
effect
of
her
words
upon
him
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
she
viewed
him
with
an
air
of
triumph
which
brought
back
some
of
her
beauty
when
she
spoke
it
was
to
say
if
you
wish
to
join
me
in
springfield
before
the
time
i
have
set
well
and
good
i
am
willing
that
the
time
of
our
separation
should
be
shortened
but
it
must
not
be
lengthened
by
so
much
as
a
day
now
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
will
go
and
pack
my
trunks
he
shuddered
her
voice
penetrated
him
to
the
quick
drawing
herself
up
she
looked
down
on
him
with
a
strange
mixture
of
passion
and
elation
you
need
fear
no
indiscretion
on
my
part
so
long
as
our
armistice
lasts
said
she
no
one
can
drag
the
truth
from
me
while
any
hope
remains
of
your
doing
your
duty
by
me
in
the
way
i
have
suggested
and
still
he
did
not
move
frederick
was
it
her
voice
that
was
thus
murmuring
his
name
can
the
tiger
snarl
one
moment
and
fawn
the
next
frederick
i
have
a
final
word
to
say
a
last
farewell
up
to
this
hour
i
have
endured
your
attentions
or
let
us
say
accepted
them
for
i
always
found
you
handsome
and
agreeable
if
not
the
master
of
my
heart
but
now
it
is
love
that
i
feel
love
and
love
with
me
is
no
fancy
but
a
passion
do
you
hear
a
passion
which
will
make
life
a
heaven
or
hell
for
the
man
who
has
inspired
it
you
should
have
thought
of
this
when
you
opposed
me
and
with
a
look
in
which
love
and
hatred
contended
for
mastery
she
bent
and
imprinted
a
kiss
upon
his
forehead
next
moment
she
was
gone
or
so
he
thought
but
when
after
an
interval
of
nameless
recoil
he
rose
and
attempted
to
stagger
from
the
place
he
discovered
that
she
had
been
detained
in
the
hall
by
two
or
three
men
who
had
just
come
in
by
the
front
door
is
this
miss
page
they
were
asking
yes
i
am
miss
page
amabel
page
she
replied
with
suave
politeness
if
you
have
any
business
with
me
state
it
quickly
for
i
am
about
to
leave
town
that
is
what
we
wish
to
prevent
declared
a
tall
thin
young
man
who
seemed
to
take
the
lead
till
the
inquest
has
been
held
over
the
remains
of
webb
coroner
talbot
wishes
you
to
regard
yourself
as
a
possible
witness
me
she
cried
with
an
admirable
gesture
of
surprise
and
a
wide
opening
of
her
brown
eyes
that
made
her
look
like
an
astonished
child
what
have
i
got
to
do
with
it
you
pointed
out
a
certain
spot
of
blood
on
the
grass
and
well
the
coroner
orders
have
to
be
obeyed
miss
you
can
not
leave
the
town
without
running
the
risk
of
arrest
then
i
will
stay
in
it
she
smiled
i
have
no
liking
for
arrests
and
the
glint
of
her
eye
rested
for
a
moment
on
frederick
sutherland
she
continued
as
that
gentleman
appeared
at
the
door
i
shall
have
to
impose
upon
your
hospitality
for
a
few
days
longer
these
men
here
inform
me
that
my
innocent
interest
in
pointing
out
to
you
that
spot
of
blood
on
webb
lawn
has
awakened
some
curiosity
and
that
i
am
wanted
as
a
witness
by
the
coroner
sutherland
with
a
quick
stride
lessened
the
distance
between
himself
and
these
unwelcome
intruders
the
coroner
wishes
are
paramount
just
now
said
he
but
the
look
he
gave
his
son
was
not
soon
forgotten
by
the
spectators
ix
a
grand
woman
there
was
but
one
topic
discussed
in
the
that
day
and
that
was
the
life
and
character
of
agatha
webb
her
history
had
not
been
a
happy
one
she
and
philemon
had
come
from
portchester
some
twenty
or
more
years
before
to
escape
the
sorrows
associated
with
their
native
town
they
had
left
behind
them
six
small
graves
in
portchester
churchyard
but
though
evidences
of
their
affliction
were
always
to
be
seen
in
the
countenances
of
either
they
had
entered
with
so
much
purpose
into
the
life
of
their
adopted
town
that
they
had
become
persons
of
note
there
till
philemon
health
began
to
fail
when
agatha
quit
all
outside
work
and
devoted
herself
exclusively
to
him
of
her
character
and
winsome
personality
we
can
gather
some
idea
from
the
various
conversations
carried
on
that
day
from
portchester
green
to
the
shipyards
in
sutherlandtown
in
deacon
brainerd
cottage
the
discussion
was
concerning
lack
of
vanity
a
virtue
not
very
common
at
that
time
among
the
women
of
this
busy
seaport
for
a
woman
so
handsome
the
good
deacon
was
saying
and
i
think
i
can
safely
call
her
the
woman
who
ever
trod
these
streets
she
showed
as
little
interest
in
dress
as
anyone
i
ever
knew
calico
at
home
and
calico
at
church
yet
she
looked
as
much
of
a
lady
in
her
gowns
as
webster
in
her
silks
or
parsons
in
her
sealskin
as
this
was
a
topic
within
the
scope
of
his
eldest
intelligence
she
at
once
spoke
up
i
never
thought
she
needed
to
dress
so
plainly
i
do
believe
in
such
a
show
of
poverty
myself
if
one
is
too
poor
to
go
decent
all
right
but
they
say
she
had
more
money
than
most
anyone
in
town
i
wonder
who
is
going
to
get
the
benefit
of
it
why
philemon
of
course
that
is
as
long
as
he
lives
he
doubtless
had
the
making
of
it
is
it
true
that
he
gone
clean
out
of
his
head
since
her
death
interposed
a
neighbour
who
had
happened
in
so
they
say
i
believe
widow
jones
has
taken
him
into
her
house
do
you
think
asked
a
second
daughter
with
becoming
hesitation
that
he
had
anything
to
do
with
her
death
some
of
the
neighbours
say
he
struck
her
while
in
one
of
his
crazy
fits
while
others
declare
she
was
killed
by
some
stranger
equally
old
and
almost
as
infirm
we
wo
discuss
the
subject
objected
the
deacon
time
will
show
who
robbed
us
of
the
and
most
capable
woman
in
these
parts
and
will
time
show
who
killed
batsy
it
was
a
morsel
of
a
girl
who
spoke
the
least
one
of
the
family
but
the
brightest
i
sorry
for
batsy
she
always
gave
me
cookies
when
i
went
to
see
mrs
webb
batsy
was
a
good
girl
for
a
swede
allowed
the
deacon
wife
who
had
not
spoken
till
now
when
she
first
came
into
town
on
the
spars
of
that
wrecked
ship
we
all
remember
there
was
some
struggle
between
agatha
and
me
as
to
which
of
us
should
have
her
but
i
did
like
the
task
of
teaching
her
the
name
of
every
pot
and
pan
she
had
to
use
in
the
kitchen
so
i
gave
her
up
to
agatha
and
it
was
fortunate
i
did
for
i
never
been
able
to
understand
her
talk
to
this
day
i
could
talk
with
her
right
well
lisped
the
little
one
she
never
called
things
by
their
swedish
names
unless
she
was
worried
and
i
never
worried
her
i
wonder
if
she
would
have
worshipped
the
ground
under
your
feet
as
she
did
that
under
agatha
asked
the
deacon
eying
his
wife
with
just
the
suspicion
of
a
malicious
twinkle
in
his
eye
i
am
not
the
and
most
capable
woman
in
town
retorted
his
wife
clicking
her
needles
as
she
went
on
knitting
in
sprague
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
squire
fisher
was
relating
some
old
tales
of
bygone
portchester
days
i
knew
agatha
when
she
was
a
girl
he
avowed
she
had
the
grandest
manners
and
the
most
enchanting
smile
of
any
rich
or
poor
man
daughter
between
the
coast
and
springfield
she
did
not
dress
in
calico
then
she
wore
the
gayest
clothes
her
father
could
buy
her
and
old
jacob
was
not
without
means
to
make
his
daughter
the
leading
figure
in
town
how
we
young
fellows
did
adore
her
and
what
lengths
we
went
to
win
one
of
her
glorious
smiles
two
of
us
john
and
james
zabel
have
lived
bachelors
for
her
sake
to
this
very
day
but
i
had
courage
enough
for
that
i
married
and
something
between
a
sigh
and
a
chuckle
filled
out
the
sentence
what
made
philemon
carry
off
the
prize
his
good
looks
yes
or
his
good
luck
it
was
his
snap
of
that
you
may
be
sure
james
zabel
had
the
snap
and
he
was
her
first
choice
too
but
he
got
into
some
difficulty
i
never
knew
just
what
it
was
but
it
was
regarded
as
serious
at
the
time
and
that
match
was
broken
off
afterwards
she
married
philemon
you
see
i
was
out
of
it
altogether
had
never
been
in
it
perhaps
but
there
were
three
good
years
of
my
life
in
which
i
thought
of
little
else
than
agatha
i
admired
her
spirit
you
see
there
was
something
more
taking
in
her
ways
than
in
her
beauty
wonderful
as
that
was
she
ruled
us
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
yet
we
worshipped
her
i
have
wondered
to
see
her
so
meek
of
late
i
never
thought
she
would
be
satisfied
with
a
cottage
and
a
husband
of
failing
wits
but
no
one
to
my
knowledge
has
ever
heard
a
complaint
from
her
lips
and
the
dignity
of
her
afflicted
has
far
transcended
the
haughtiness
of
those
days
when
she
had
but
to
smile
to
have
all
the
youth
of
portchester
at
her
feet
i
suppose
it
was
the
loss
of
so
many
children
that
reconciled
her
to
a
quiet
life
a
woman
can
not
close
the
eyes
of
six
children
one
after
the
other
without
some
modification
taking
place
in
her
character
yes
she
and
philemon
have
been
unfortunate
but
she
was
a
splendid
looking
girl
boys
i
never
see
such
women
now
in
a
little
cottage
on
the
hillside
a
woman
was
nursing
a
baby
and
talking
at
the
same
time
of
agatha
webb
i
shall
never
forget
the
night
my
first
baby
fell
sick
she
faltered
i
was
just
out
of
bed
myself
and
having
no
nearer
neighbours
then
than
now
i
was
all
alone
on
the
hillside
alec
being
away
at
sea
i
was
too
young
to
know
much
about
sickness
but
something
told
me
that
i
must
have
help
before
morning
or
my
baby
would
die
though
i
could
just
walk
across
the
floor
i
threw
a
shawl
around
me
took
my
baby
in
my
arms
and
opened
the
door
a
blinding
gust
of
rain
blew
in
a
terrible
storm
was
raging
and
i
had
not
noticed
it
i
was
so
taken
up
with
the
child
i
could
not
face
that
gale
indeed
i
was
so
weak
i
fell
on
my
knees
as
it
struck
me
and
became
dripping
wet
before
i
could
drag
myself
inside
the
baby
began
to
moan
and
everything
was
turning
dark
before
me
when
i
heard
a
strong
sweet
voice
cry
out
in
the
roadway
there
room
in
this
house
for
me
till
the
storm
has
blown
by
i
can
not
see
my
way
down
the
hillside
with
a
bursting
heart
i
looked
up
a
woman
was
standing
in
the
doorway
with
the
look
of
an
angel
in
her
eyes
i
did
not
know
her
but
her
face
was
one
to
bring
comfort
to
the
saddest
heart
holding
up
my
baby
i
cried
baby
is
dying
i
tried
to
go
for
the
doctor
but
my
knees
bent
under
me
help
me
as
you
are
a
mother
i
i
must
have
fallen
again
for
the
next
thing
i
remember
i
was
lying
by
the
hearth
looking
up
into
her
face
which
was
bending
over
me
she
was
white
as
the
rag
i
had
tied
about
my
baby
throat
and
by
the
way
her
breast
heaved
she
was
either
very
much
frightened
or
very
sorry
wish
you
had
the
help
of
anyone
else
said
she
perish
in
my
arms
and
wither
at
my
breast
i
can
not
touch
it
much
as
i
yearn
to
but
let
me
see
its
face
perhaps
i
can
tell
you
what
is
the
matter
with
it
i
showed
her
the
baby
face
and
she
bent
over
it
trembling
very
much
almost
as
much
indeed
as
myself
is
very
sick
she
said
if
you
will
use
the
remedies
i
advise
i
think
you
can
save
it
and
she
told
me
what
to
do
and
helped
me
all
she
could
but
she
did
not
lay
a
finger
on
the
little
darling
though
from
the
way
she
watched
it
i
saw
that
her
heart
was
set
on
his
getting
better
and
he
did
in
an
hour
he
was
sleeping
peacefully
and
the
terrible
weight
was
gone
from
my
heart
and
from
hers
when
the
storm
stopped
and
she
could
leave
the
house
she
gave
me
a
kiss
but
the
look
she
gave
him
meant
more
than
kisses
god
must
have
forgotten
her
goodness
to
me
that
night
when
he
let
her
die
so
pitiable
a
death
at
the
minister
house
they
were
commenting
upon
the
look
of
serenity
observable
in
her
dead
face
i
have
known
her
for
thirty
years
her
pastor
declared
and
never
before
have
i
seen
her
wear
a
look
of
real
peace
it
is
wonderful
considering
the
circumstances
do
you
think
she
was
so
weary
of
her
life
long
struggle
that
she
hailed
any
release
from
it
even
that
of
violence
a
young
man
a
lawyer
visiting
them
from
new
york
was
the
only
one
to
answer
i
never
saw
the
woman
you
are
talking
about
said
he
and
know
nothing
of
the
circumstances
of
her
death
beyond
what
you
have
told
me
but
from
the
very
incongruity
between
her
expression
and
the
violent
nature
of
her
death
i
argue
that
there
are
depths
to
this
crime
which
have
not
yet
been
sounded
what
depths
it
is
a
simple
case
of
murder
followed
by
theft
to
be
sure
we
do
not
yet
know
the
criminal
but
money
was
his
motive
that
is
clear
enough
are
you
ready
to
wager
that
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
this
was
a
startling
proposition
to
the
minister
you
forget
my
cloth
said
he
the
young
man
smiled
that
is
true
pardon
me
i
was
only
anxious
to
show
how
strong
my
conviction
was
against
any
such
easy
explanation
of
a
crime
marked
by
such
contradictory
features
two
children
on
the
portchester
road
were
exchanging
boyish
confidences
do
you
know
what
i
think
about
it
asked
one
naw
how
should
i
wall
i
think
old
webb
got
the
likes
of
what
she
sent
do
you
know
she
had
six
children
once
and
that
she
killed
every
one
of
them
she
yes
i
heard
her
tell
granny
once
all
about
it
she
said
there
was
a
blight
on
her
house
i
do
know
what
that
is
but
i
guess
something
big
and
heavy
and
that
it
fell
on
every
one
of
her
children
as
fast
as
they
came
and
killed
then
i
glad
i
be
her
child
very
different
were
the
recollections
interchanged
between
two
portchester
women
she
was
drinking
tea
at
my
house
when
her
sister
sairey
came
running
in
with
the
news
that
the
baby
she
had
left
at
home
was
quite
right
that
was
her
first
child
you
know
yes
yes
for
i
was
with
her
when
that
baby
came
broke
in
the
other
and
such
joy
as
she
showed
when
they
told
her
it
was
alive
and
well
i
never
saw
i
do
not
know
why
she
did
expect
it
to
be
alive
but
she
did
and
her
happiness
was
just
wonderful
to
see
well
she
did
enjoy
it
long
the
poor
little
fellow
died
young
but
i
was
telling
you
of
the
night
when
she
first
heard
he
was
ailing
philemon
had
been
telling
a
good
story
and
we
were
all
laughing
when
sairey
came
in
i
can
see
agatha
now
she
always
had
the
most
brilliant
eyes
in
the
county
but
that
day
they
were
superbly
dazzling
they
changed
though
at
the
sight
of
sairey
face
and
she
jumped
to
meet
her
just
as
if
she
knew
what
sairey
was
going
to
say
before
ever
a
word
left
her
lips
baby
i
can
hear
her
yet
is
the
matter
with
the
baby
and
though
sairey
made
haste
to
tell
her
that
he
was
only
ailing
and
not
at
all
ill
she
turned
upon
philemon
with
a
look
none
of
us
ever
quite
understood
he
changed
so
completely
under
it
just
as
she
had
under
sairey
and
to
neither
did
the
old
happiness
ever
return
for
the
child
died
within
a
week
and
when
the
next
came
it
died
also
and
the
next
till
six
small
innocents
lay
buried
in
yonder
old
graveyard
i
know
and
sad
enough
it
was
too
especially
as
she
and
philemon
were
both
fond
of
children
well
well
the
ways
of
providence
are
past
rinding
out
and
now
she
is
gone
and
philemon
ah
he
follow
her
soon
he
ca
live
without
agatha
nearer
home
the
old
sexton
was
chattering
about
the
six
gravestones
raised
in
portchester
churchyard
to
these
six
dead
infants
he
had
been
sent
there
to
choose
a
spot
in
which
to
lay
the
mother
and
was
full
of
the
shock
it
gave
him
to
see
that
line
of
little
stones
telling
of
a
past
with
which
the
good
people
of
sutherlandtown
found
it
hard
to
associate
philemon
and
agatha
webb
i
a
digger
of
graves
he
mused
half
to
himself
and
half
to
his
old
wife
watching
him
from
the
other
side
of
the
hearthstone
i
spend
a
good
quarter
of
my
time
in
the
churchyard
but
when
i
saw
those
six
little
mounds
and
read
the
inscriptions
over
them
i
could
help
feeling
queer
think
of
this
on
the
first
tiny
headstone
i
read
these
words
stephen
son
of
philemon
and
agatha
webb
died
aged
six
weeks
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
now
what
does
that
mean
did
you
ever
hear
anyone
say
no
was
his
old
wife
answer
perhaps
she
was
one
of
those
calvinist
folks
who
believe
babies
go
to
hell
if
they
are
not
baptised
but
her
children
were
all
baptised
i
been
told
so
some
of
them
before
she
was
well
out
of
her
bed
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
and
the
chick
not
six
weeks
old
something
queer
about
that
dame
if
it
did
happen
more
than
thirty
years
ago
what
did
you
see
over
the
grave
of
the
child
who
was
killed
in
her
arms
by
lightning
this
he
was
not
for
god
took
him
farmer
waite
had
but
one
word
to
say
she
came
to
me
when
my
sissy
had
the
smallpox
the
only
person
in
town
who
would
enter
my
doors
more
than
that
when
sissy
was
up
and
i
went
to
pay
the
doctor
bill
i
found
it
had
been
settled
i
did
not
know
then
who
had
enough
money
and
compassion
to
do
this
for
me
now
i
do
many
an
act
of
kindness
which
had
been
secretly
performed
in
that
town
during
the
last
twenty
years
came
to
light
on
that
day
the
most
notable
of
which
was
the
sending
of
a
certain
young
lad
to
school
and
his
subsequent
education
as
a
minister
but
other
memories
of
a
sweeter
and
more
secret
nature
still
came
up
likewise
among
them
the
following
a
young
girl
who
was
of
a
very
timid
but
deeply
sensitive
nature
had
been
urged
into
an
engagement
with
a
man
she
did
not
like
though
the
conflict
this
occasioned
her
and
the
misery
which
accompanied
it
were
apparent
to
everybody
nobody
stirred
in
her
behalf
but
agatha
she
went
to
see
her
and
though
it
was
within
a
fortnight
of
the
wedding
she
did
not
hesitate
to
advise
the
girl
to
give
him
up
and
when
the
poor
child
said
she
lacked
the
courage
agatha
herself
went
to
the
man
and
urged
him
into
a
display
of
generosity
which
saved
the
poor
timid
thing
from
a
life
of
misery
they
say
this
was
no
easy
task
for
agatha
and
that
the
man
was
sullen
for
a
year
but
the
girl
gratitude
was
boundless
of
her
daring
which
was
always
on
the
side
of
right
and
justice
the
stories
were
numerous
so
were
the
accounts
mostly
among
the
women
of
her
rare
tenderness
and
sympathy
for
the
weak
and
the
erring
never
was
a
man
talked
to
as
she
talked
to
jake
cobleigh
the
evening
after
he
struck
his
mother
and
if
she
had
been
in
town
on
the
day
when
clarissa
mayhew
ran
away
with
that
philadelphia
adventurer
many
said
it
would
never
have
happened
for
no
girl
could
stand
the
admonition
or
resist
the
pleading
of
this
childless
mother
it
was
reserved
for
halliday
and
sutherland
to
talk
of
her
mental
qualities
her
character
was
so
marked
and
her
manner
so
simple
that
few
gave
attention
to
the
intellect
that
was
the
real
basis
of
her
power
the
two
mentioned
gentlemen
however
appreciated
her
to
the
full
and
it
was
while
listening
to
their
remarks
that
frederick
was
suddenly
startled
by
some
one
saying
to
him
you
are
the
only
person
in
town
who
have
nothing
to
say
about
agatha
webb
did
you
ever
exchange
any
words
with
her
for
i
can
hardly
believe
you
could
have
met
her
eye
to
eye
without
having
some
remark
to
make
about
her
beauty
or
her
influence
the
speaker
was
agnes
halliday
who
had
come
in
with
her
father
for
a
social
chat
she
was
one
of
frederick
earliest
playmates
but
one
with
whom
he
had
never
assimilated
and
who
did
not
like
him
he
knew
this
as
did
everyone
else
in
town
and
it
was
with
some
hesitation
he
turned
to
answer
her
i
have
but
one
recollection
he
began
and
for
the
moment
got
no
farther
for
in
turning
his
head
to
address
his
young
guest
he
had
allowed
his
gaze
to
wander
through
the
open
window
by
which
she
sat
into
the
garden
beyond
where
amabel
could
be
seen
picking
flowers
as
he
spoke
amabel
lifted
her
face
with
one
of
her
suggestive
looks
she
had
doubtless
heard
miss
halliday
remark
recovering
himself
with
an
effort
he
repeated
his
words
i
have
but
one
recollection
of
webb
that
i
can
give
you
years
ago
when
i
was
a
lad
i
was
playing
on
the
green
with
several
other
boys
we
had
had
some
dispute
about
a
lost
ball
and
i
was
swearing
angrily
and
loud
when
i
suddenly
perceived
before
me
the
tall
form
and
compassionate
face
of
webb
she
was
dressed
in
her
usual
simple
way
and
had
a
basket
on
her
arm
but
she
looked
so
superior
to
any
other
woman
i
had
ever
met
that
i
did
not
know
whether
to
hide
my
face
in
her
skirts
or
to
follow
my
first
impulse
and
run
away
she
saw
the
emotion
she
had
aroused
and
lifting
up
my
face
by
the
chin
she
said
boy
i
have
buried
six
children
all
of
them
younger
than
you
and
now
my
husband
and
myself
live
alone
often
and
often
have
i
wished
that
one
at
least
of
these
darling
infants
might
have
been
spared
us
but
had
god
given
me
the
choice
of
having
them
die
young
and
innocent
or
of
growing
up
to
swear
as
i
have
heard
you
i
should
have
prayed
god
to
take
them
as
he
did
you
have
a
mother
do
not
break
her
heart
by
taking
in
vain
the
name
of
the
god
she
reveres
and
with
that
she
kissed
me
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
you
in
whatever
folly
or
wickedness
i
have
indulged
i
have
never
made
use
of
an
oath
from
that
day
to
this
and
i
thank
god
for
it
there
was
such
unusual
feeling
in
his
voice
a
feeling
that
none
had
ever
suspected
him
capable
of
before
that
miss
halliday
regarded
him
with
astonishment
and
quite
forgot
to
indulge
in
her
usual
banter
even
the
gentlemen
sat
still
and
there
was
a
momentary
silence
through
which
there
presently
broke
the
incongruous
sound
of
a
shrill
and
mocking
laugh
it
came
from
amabel
who
had
just
finished
gathering
her
bouquet
in
the
garden
outside
x
detective
knapp
arrives
meanwhile
in
a
small
room
at
the
a
still
more
serious
conversation
was
in
progress
talbot
fenton
and
a
certain
able
lawyer
in
town
by
the
name
of
harvey
were
in
close
discussion
the
last
had
broken
the
silence
of
years
and
was
telling
what
he
knew
of
webb
affairs
he
was
a
shrewd
man
of
unblemished
reputation
when
called
upon
to
talk
he
talked
well
but
he
much
preferred
listening
and
was
as
now
appeared
the
safest
repository
of
secrets
to
be
found
in
all
that
region
he
had
been
married
three
times
and
could
still
count
thirteen
children
around
his
board
one
reason
perhaps
why
he
had
learned
to
cultivate
silence
to
such
a
degree
happily
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
talk
and
he
talked
this
is
what
he
said
some
fifteen
years
ago
philemon
webb
came
to
me
with
a
small
sum
of
money
which
he
said
he
wished
to
have
me
invest
for
his
wife
it
was
the
fruit
of
a
small
speculation
of
his
and
he
wanted
it
given
unconditionally
to
her
without
her
knowledge
or
that
of
the
neighbours
i
accordingly
made
out
a
deed
of
gift
which
he
signed
with
joyful
alacrity
and
then
after
due
thought
and
careful
investigation
i
put
the
money
into
a
new
enterprise
then
being
started
in
boston
it
was
the
best
stroke
of
business
i
ever
did
in
my
life
at
the
end
of
a
year
it
paid
double
and
after
five
had
rolled
away
the
accumulated
interest
had
reached
such
a
sum
that
both
philemon
and
myself
thought
it
wisest
to
let
her
know
what
she
was
worth
and
what
was
being
done
with
the
money
i
was
in
hopes
it
would
lead
her
to
make
some
change
in
her
mode
of
living
which
seemed
to
me
out
of
keeping
with
her
appearance
and
mental
qualifications
while
he
i
imagine
looked
for
something
more
important
still
a
smile
on
the
face
which
had
somehow
lost
the
trick
of
merriment
though
it
had
never
acquired
that
of
ill
nature
but
we
did
not
know
agatha
at
least
i
did
not
when
she
learned
that
she
was
rich
she
looked
at
first
awestruck
and
then
forgetting
me
or
ignoring
me
it
makes
no
matter
which
she
threw
herself
into
arms
and
wept
while
he
poor
faithful
fellow
looked
as
distressed
as
if
he
had
brought
news
of
failure
instead
of
triumphant
success
i
suppose
she
thought
of
her
buried
children
and
what
the
money
would
have
been
to
her
if
they
had
lived
but
she
did
not
speak
of
them
nor
am
i
quite
sure
they
were
in
her
thoughts
when
after
the
first
excitement
was
over
she
drew
back
and
said
quietly
but
in
a
tone
of
strong
feeling
to
philemon
meant
me
a
happy
surprise
and
you
must
not
be
disappointed
this
is
heart
money
we
will
use
it
to
make
our
townsfolk
happy
i
saw
him
glance
at
her
dress
which
was
a
purple
calico
i
remember
it
because
of
that
look
and
because
of
the
sad
smile
with
which
she
followed
his
glance
we
not
afford
now
he
ventured
little
show
of
luxury
or
at
least
a
ribbon
or
so
for
this
beautiful
throat
of
yours
she
did
not
answer
him
but
her
look
had
a
rare
compassion
in
it
a
compassion
strange
to
say
that
seemed
to
be
expended
upon
him
rather
than
upon
herself
philemon
swallowed
his
disappointment
is
right
he
said
to
me
do
not
need
luxury
i
do
not
know
how
i
so
far
forgot
myself
as
to
mention
it
that
was
ten
years
ago
and
every
day
since
then
her
property
has
increased
i
did
not
know
then
and
i
do
not
know
now
why
they
were
both
so
anxious
that
all
knowledge
of
their
good
fortune
should
be
kept
from
those
about
them
but
that
it
was
to
be
so
kept
was
made
very
evident
to
me
and
notwithstanding
all
temptations
to
the
contrary
i
have
refrained
from
uttering
a
word
likely
to
give
away
their
secret
the
money
which
to
all
appearance
was
the
cause
of
her
tragic
and
untimely
death
was
interest
money
which
i
was
delegated
to
deliver
her
i
took
it
to
her
day
before
yesterday
and
it
was
all
in
crisp
new
notes
some
of
them
twenties
but
most
of
them
tens
and
fives
i
am
free
to
say
there
was
not
such
another
roll
of
fresh
money
in
town
warn
all
shopkeepers
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
new
bills
in
the
money
they
receive
was
talbot
comment
to
the
constable
fresh
bills
are
none
too
common
in
this
town
and
now
about
her
will
did
you
draw
that
up
harvey
no
i
did
not
know
she
had
made
one
i
often
spoke
to
her
about
the
advisability
of
her
doing
so
but
she
always
put
me
off
and
now
it
seems
that
she
had
it
drawn
up
in
boston
could
not
trust
her
old
friend
with
too
many
secrets
i
suppose
so
you
do
know
how
her
money
has
been
left
no
more
than
you
do
here
an
interruption
occurred
the
door
opened
and
a
slim
young
man
wearing
spectacles
came
in
at
sight
of
him
they
all
rose
well
eagerly
inquired
talbot
nothing
new
answered
the
young
man
with
a
consequential
air
the
elder
woman
died
from
loss
of
blood
consequent
upon
a
blow
given
by
a
small
slender
blade
the
younger
from
a
stroke
of
apoplexy
induced
by
fright
good
i
am
glad
to
hear
my
instincts
were
not
at
fault
loss
of
blood
eh
death
then
was
not
instantaneous
no
strange
fell
from
the
lips
of
his
two
listeners
she
lived
yet
gave
no
alarm
none
that
was
heard
suggested
the
young
doctor
who
was
from
another
town
or
if
heard
reached
no
ears
but
philemon
observed
the
constable
something
must
have
taken
him
i
am
not
so
sure
said
the
coroner
that
philemon
is
not
answerable
for
the
whole
crime
notwithstanding
our
failure
to
find
the
missing
money
anywhere
in
the
house
how
else
account
for
the
resignation
with
which
she
evidently
met
her
death
had
a
stranger
struck
her
agatha
webb
would
have
struggled
there
is
no
sign
of
struggle
in
the
room
she
would
have
struggled
against
philemon
had
she
had
strength
to
struggle
i
think
she
was
asleep
when
she
was
struck
ah
and
was
not
standing
by
the
table
how
about
the
blood
there
then
shaken
from
the
murderer
fingers
in
fright
or
disgust
there
was
no
blood
on
philemon
fingers
no
he
wiped
them
on
his
sleeve
if
he
was
the
one
to
use
the
dagger
against
her
where
is
the
dagger
should
we
not
be
able
to
find
it
somewhere
about
the
premises
he
may
have
buried
it
outside
crazy
men
are
supernaturally
cunning
when
you
can
produce
it
from
any
place
inside
that
board
fence
i
will
consider
your
theory
at
present
i
limit
my
suspicions
of
philemon
to
the
attentions
which
a
man
of
disordered
intellect
might
give
a
wife
bleeding
and
dying
under
his
eyes
my
idea
on
the
subject
is
would
you
be
so
kind
as
not
to
give
utterance
to
your
ideas
until
i
have
been
able
to
form
some
for
myself
interrupted
a
voice
from
the
doorway
as
this
voice
was
unexpected
they
all
turned
a
small
man
with
sleek
dark
hair
and
expressionless
features
stood
before
them
behind
him
was
abel
carrying
a
and
umbrella
the
detective
from
boston
announced
the
latter
coroner
talbot
rose
you
are
in
good
time
he
remarked
we
have
work
of
no
ordinary
nature
for
you
the
man
failed
to
look
interested
but
then
his
countenance
was
not
one
to
show
emotion
my
name
is
knapp
said
he
i
have
had
my
supper
and
am
ready
to
go
to
work
i
have
read
the
newspapers
all
i
want
now
is
any
additional
facts
that
have
come
to
light
since
the
telegraphic
dispatches
were
sent
to
boston
facts
mind
you
not
theories
i
never
allow
myself
to
be
hampered
by
other
persons
theories
not
liking
his
manner
which
was
brusque
and
too
for
a
man
of
such
insignificant
appearance
coroner
talbot
referred
him
to
fenton
who
immediately
proceeded
to
give
him
the
result
of
such
investigations
as
he
and
his
men
had
been
able
to
make
which
done
knapp
put
on
his
hat
and
turned
toward
the
door
i
will
go
to
the
house
and
see
for
myself
what
is
to
be
learned
there
said
he
may
i
ask
the
privilege
of
going
alone
he
added
as
fenton
moved
abel
will
see
that
i
am
given
admittance
show
me
your
credentials
said
the
coroner
he
did
so
they
seem
all
right
and
you
should
be
a
man
who
understands
his
business
go
alone
if
you
prefer
but
bring
your
conclusions
here
they
may
need
some
correcting
oh
i
will
return
knapp
nonchalantly
remarked
and
went
out
having
made
anything
but
a
favourable
impression
upon
the
assembled
gentlemen
i
wish
we
had
shown
more
grit
and
tried
to
handle
this
thing
ourselves
observed
fenton
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
that
cold
bloodless
creature
hovering
over
our
beloved
agatha
i
wonder
at
carson
why
should
he
send
us
such
a
man
could
he
not
see
the
matter
demanded
extraordinary
skill
and
judgment
oh
this
fellow
may
have
skill
but
he
is
so
unpleasant
i
hate
to
deal
with
folks
of
such
characteristics
but
who
is
this
he
asked
as
a
gentle
tap
was
heard
at
the
door
why
it
loton
what
can
he
want
here
the
man
whose
presence
in
the
doorway
had
called
out
this
exclamation
started
at
the
sound
of
the
doctor
heavy
voice
and
came
very
hesitatingly
forward
he
was
of
a
weak
irritable
type
and
seemed
to
be
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
i
beg
pardon
said
he
for
showing
myself
i
do
like
to
intrude
into
such
company
but
i
have
something
to
tell
you
which
may
be
of
use
sirs
though
it
is
any
great
thing
either
something
about
the
murder
which
has
taken
place
asked
the
coroner
in
a
milder
tone
he
knew
loton
well
and
realised
the
advisability
of
encouragement
in
his
case
the
murder
oh
i
would
presume
to
say
anything
about
the
murder
i
not
the
man
to
stir
up
any
such
subject
as
that
it
about
the
money
or
some
money
more
money
than
usually
falls
into
my
till
it
it
was
rather
queer
sirs
and
i
have
felt
the
flutter
of
it
all
day
shall
i
tell
you
about
it
it
happened
last
night
late
last
night
sirs
so
late
that
i
was
in
bed
with
my
wife
and
had
been
snoring
she
said
four
hours
what
money
new
money
crisp
fresh
bills
loton
eagerly
questioned
fenton
loton
who
was
the
keeper
of
a
small
confectionery
and
bakery
store
on
one
of
the
side
streets
leading
up
the
hill
shifted
uneasily
between
his
two
interrogators
and
finally
addressed
himself
to
the
coroner
it
was
new
money
i
thought
it
felt
so
at
night
but
i
was
sure
of
it
in
the
morning
a
bill
sir
a
but
that
is
the
queerest
thing
about
it
i
was
asleep
sir
sound
asleep
and
dreaming
of
my
courting
days
for
i
asked
sally
at
the
circus
sirs
and
the
band
playing
on
the
hill
made
me
think
of
it
when
i
was
suddenly
shook
awake
by
sally
herself
who
says
she
had
slept
a
wink
for
listening
to
the
music
and
wishing
she
was
a
girl
again
a
man
at
the
shop
door
cries
she
of
you
go
and
see
what
he
wants
i
was
mad
at
being
wakened
dreaming
is
pleasant
specially
when
clowns
and
kissing
get
mixed
up
in
it
but
duty
is
duty
and
so
into
the
shop
i
stumbled
swearing
a
bit
perhaps
for
i
had
stopped
for
a
light
and
it
was
as
dark
as
double
shutters
could
make
it
the
hammering
had
become
deafening
no
let
up
till
i
reached
the
door
when
it
suddenly
ceased
is
it
i
cried
there
and
what
do
you
want
a
trembling
voice
answered
me
me
in
it
said
want
to
buy
something
to
eat
for
god
sake
open
the
door
i
do
know
why
i
obeyed
for
it
was
late
and
i
did
not
know
the
voice
but
something
in
the
impatient
rattling
of
the
door
which
accompanied
the
words
affected
me
in
spite
of
myself
and
i
slowly
opened
my
shop
to
this
midnight
customer
must
be
hungry
i
began
but
the
person
who
had
crowded
in
as
soon
as
the
opening
was
large
enough
would
let
me
finish
i
want
bread
or
crackers
or
anything
that
you
can
find
easiest
he
gasped
like
a
man
who
had
been
running
money
and
he
poked
into
my
hand
a
bill
so
stiff
that
it
rattled
more
than
enough
he
hastened
to
say
as
i
hesitated
over
it
never
mind
that
i
come
for
the
change
in
the
morning
are
you
i
cried
are
not
blind
willy
i
sure
but
his
only
answer
was
while
he
leaned
so
hard
against
the
counter
i
felt
it
shake
i
could
not
stand
that
cry
of
so
i
groped
about
in
the
dark
and
found
him
a
stale
loaf
which
i
put
into
his
arms
with
a
short
now
tell
me
what
your
name
is
but
at
this
he
seemed
to
shrink
into
himself
and
muttering
something
that
might
pass
for
thanks
he
stumbled
towards
the
door
and
rushed
hastily
out
running
after
him
i
listened
eagerly
to
his
steps
they
went
up
the
hill
and
the
money
what
about
the
money
asked
the
coroner
did
he
come
back
for
the
change
no
i
put
it
in
the
till
thinking
it
was
a
dollar
bill
but
when
i
came
to
look
at
it
in
the
morning
it
was
a
twenty
yes
sirs
a
twenty
this
was
startling
the
coroner
and
the
constable
looked
at
each
other
before
looking
again
at
him
and
where
is
that
bill
now
asked
the
former
have
you
brought
it
with
you
i
have
sir
it
been
in
and
out
of
the
till
twenty
times
i
have
known
what
to
do
with
it
i
do
like
to
think
wrong
of
anybody
but
when
i
heard
that
webb
god
bless
her
was
murdered
last
night
for
money
i
could
rest
for
the
weight
of
this
thing
on
my
conscience
here
the
bill
sir
i
wish
i
had
let
the
old
man
rap
on
my
door
till
morning
before
i
had
taken
it
from
him
they
did
not
share
this
feeling
a
distinct
and
valuable
clew
seemed
to
be
afforded
them
by
the
fresh
crisp
bill
they
saw
in
his
hand
silently
talbot
took
it
while
fenton
with
a
shrewd
look
asked
what
reasons
have
you
for
calling
this
mysterious
customer
old
i
thought
it
was
so
dark
you
could
not
see
him
the
man
who
looked
relieved
since
he
had
rid
himself
of
the
bill
eyed
the
constable
in
some
perplexity
i
did
see
a
feature
of
his
face
said
he
and
yet
i
sure
he
was
old
i
never
thought
of
him
as
being
anything
else
well
we
will
see
and
is
that
all
you
have
to
tell
us
his
nod
was
expressive
and
they
let
him
go
an
hour
or
so
later
detective
knapp
made
his
reappearance
well
asked
the
coroner
as
he
came
quietly
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
what
your
opinion
simple
case
sir
murdered
for
money
find
the
man
with
a
flowing
beard
xi
the
man
with
a
beard
there
were
but
few
men
in
town
who
wore
long
beards
a
list
was
made
of
these
and
handed
to
the
coroner
who
regarded
it
with
a
grim
smile
not
a
man
whose
name
is
here
would
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanour
let
alone
a
crime
you
must
look
outside
of
our
village
population
for
the
murderer
of
agatha
webb
very
likely
but
tell
me
something
first
about
these
persons
urged
knapp
who
is
edward
hope
a
watch
repairer
a
man
of
estimable
character
and
sylvester
chubb
a
farmer
who
to
support
his
mother
wife
and
seven
children
works
from
morning
till
sundown
on
his
farm
and
from
sundown
till
at
night
on
little
fancy
articles
he
cuts
out
from
wood
and
sells
in
boston
john
barker
thomas
elder
timothy
sinn
all
good
men
i
can
vouch
for
every
one
of
them
and
john
zabel
james
zabel
irreproachable
both
of
them
famous
ship
builders
once
but
the
change
to
iron
has
thrown
them
out
of
business
pity
too
for
they
were
remarkable
builders
by
the
by
fenton
we
do
see
them
at
church
or
on
the
docks
any
more
no
they
keep
very
much
to
themselves
getting
old
like
ourselves
talbot
lively
boys
once
we
must
hunt
them
up
fenton
ca
bear
to
see
old
friends
drop
away
from
good
company
but
this
is
business
you
need
not
pause
over
their
names
knapp
but
knapp
had
slipped
out
we
will
follow
him
walking
briskly
down
the
street
he
went
up
the
steps
of
a
certain
house
and
rang
the
bell
a
gentleman
with
a
face
not
entirely
unknown
to
us
came
to
the
door
the
detective
did
not
pause
for
preliminaries
are
you
mr
crane
he
asked
the
gentleman
who
ran
against
a
man
coming
out
of
webb
house
last
night
i
am
crane
was
the
slightly
surprised
rejoinder
and
i
was
run
against
by
a
man
there
yes
very
well
remarked
the
detective
quietly
my
name
is
knapp
i
have
been
sent
from
boston
to
look
into
this
matter
and
i
have
an
idea
that
you
can
help
me
more
than
any
other
man
here
in
sutherlandtown
who
was
this
person
who
came
in
contact
with
you
so
violently
you
know
even
if
you
have
been
careful
not
to
mention
any
names
you
are
mistaken
i
do
know
i
ca
know
he
wore
a
sweeping
beard
and
walked
and
acted
like
a
man
no
longer
young
but
beyond
that
crane
excuse
me
but
i
know
men
if
you
had
no
suspicion
as
to
whom
that
person
was
you
would
not
look
so
embarrassed
you
suspect
or
at
least
associate
in
your
own
mind
a
name
with
the
man
you
met
was
it
either
of
these
you
see
written
here
crane
glanced
at
the
card
on
which
the
other
had
scribbled
a
couple
of
names
and
started
perceptibly
you
have
me
said
he
you
must
be
a
man
of
remarkable
perspicacity
the
detective
smiled
and
pocketed
his
card
the
names
he
thus
concealed
were
john
zabel
james
zabel
you
have
not
said
which
of
the
two
it
was
knapp
quietly
suggested
no
returned
the
minister
and
i
have
not
even
thought
indeed
i
am
not
sure
that
i
have
not
made
a
dreadful
mistake
in
thinking
it
was
either
a
glimpse
such
as
i
had
is
far
from
satisfactory
and
they
are
both
such
excellent
men
eight
you
did
make
a
mistake
of
course
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
so
do
think
of
the
matter
again
i
will
find
out
who
the
real
man
was
rest
easy
and
with
the
lightest
of
bows
knapp
drew
off
and
passed
as
quickly
as
he
could
without
attracting
attention
round
the
corner
to
the
confectioner
here
his
attack
was
warier
sally
loton
was
behind
the
counter
with
her
husband
and
they
had
evidently
been
talking
the
matter
over
very
confidentially
but
knapp
was
not
to
be
awed
by
her
small
keen
eye
or
strident
voice
and
presently
succeeded
in
surprising
a
knowing
look
on
the
lady
face
which
convinced
him
that
in
the
confidences
between
husband
and
wife
a
name
had
been
used
which
she
appeared
to
be
less
unwilling
to
impart
than
he
knapp
consequently
turned
his
full
attention
towards
her
using
in
his
attack
that
oldest
and
subtlest
weapon
against
the
sex
flattery
my
dear
madam
said
he
your
good
heart
is
apparent
your
husband
has
confided
to
you
a
name
which
you
out
of
fear
of
some
mistake
hesitate
to
repeat
a
neighbourly
spirit
a
very
neighbourly
spirit
but
you
should
not
allow
your
goodness
to
defeat
the
ends
of
justice
if
you
simply
told
us
whom
this
man
resembled
we
would
be
able
to
get
some
idea
of
his
appearance
he
did
resemble
anyone
i
know
growled
loton
it
was
too
dark
for
me
to
see
how
he
looked
his
voice
then
people
are
traced
by
their
voices
i
did
recognise
his
voice
knapp
smiled
his
eye
still
on
the
woman
yet
you
have
thought
of
someone
he
reminded
you
of
the
man
was
silent
but
the
wife
tossed
her
head
ever
so
lightly
now
you
must
have
had
your
reasons
for
that
no
one
thinks
of
a
good
and
respectable
neighbour
in
connection
with
the
buying
of
a
loaf
of
bread
at
midnight
with
a
bill
without
some
positive
reason
the
man
wore
a
beard
i
felt
it
brush
my
hand
as
he
took
the
loaf
good
that
is
a
point
which
made
me
think
of
other
men
who
wore
beards
as
for
instance
the
detective
had
taken
from
his
pocket
the
card
which
he
had
used
with
such
effect
at
the
minister
and
as
he
said
these
words
twirled
it
so
that
the
two
names
written
upon
it
fell
under
sally
loton
inquisitive
eyes
the
look
with
which
she
read
them
was
enough
john
zabel
james
zabel
who
told
you
it
was
either
of
these
men
she
asked
you
did
he
retorted
pocketing
the
card
with
a
smile
la
now
samuel
i
never
spoke
a
word
she
insisted
in
anxious
protest
to
her
husband
as
the
detective
slid
quietly
from
the
store
xii
wattles
comes
the
hallidays
lived
but
a
few
rods
from
the
sutherlands
yet
as
it
was
dusk
when
miss
halliday
rose
to
depart
frederick
naturally
offered
his
services
as
her
escort
she
accepted
them
with
a
slight
blush
the
first
he
had
ever
seen
on
her
face
or
at
least
had
ever
noted
there
it
caused
him
such
surprise
that
he
forgot
amabel
presence
in
the
garden
till
they
came
upon
her
at
the
gate
a
pleasant
evening
observed
that
young
girl
in
her
high
unmusical
voice
very
was
miss
halliday
short
reply
and
for
a
moment
the
two
faces
were
in
line
as
he
held
open
the
gate
before
his
departing
guest
they
were
very
different
faces
in
feature
and
expression
and
till
that
night
he
had
never
thought
of
comparing
them
indeed
the
fascination
which
beamed
from
amabel
page
far
from
regular
features
had
put
all
others
out
of
his
mind
but
now
as
he
surveyed
the
two
girls
the
candour
and
purity
which
marked
agnes
countenance
came
out
so
strongly
under
his
glance
that
amabel
lost
all
attraction
for
him
and
he
drew
his
young
neighbour
hastily
away
amabel
noted
the
movement
and
smiled
her
contempt
for
agnes
charms
amounted
to
disdain
she
might
have
felt
less
confidence
in
her
own
had
she
been
in
a
position
to
note
the
frequent
glances
frederick
cast
at
his
old
playmate
as
they
proceeded
slowly
up
the
road
not
that
there
was
any
passion
in
them
he
was
too
full
of
care
for
that
but
the
curiosity
which
could
prompt
him
to
turn
his
head
a
dozen
times
in
the
course
of
so
short
a
walk
to
see
why
agnes
halliday
held
her
face
so
persistently
away
from
him
had
an
element
of
feeling
in
it
that
was
more
or
less
significant
as
for
agnes
she
was
so
unlike
her
accustomed
self
as
to
astonish
even
herself
whereas
she
had
never
before
walked
a
dozen
steps
with
him
without
indulging
in
some
sharp
saying
she
found
herself
disinclined
to
speak
at
all
much
less
to
speak
lightly
in
mutual
silence
then
they
reached
the
gateway
leading
into
the
halliday
grounds
but
agnes
having
passed
in
they
both
stopped
and
for
the
first
time
looked
squarely
at
each
other
her
eyes
fell
first
perhaps
because
his
had
changed
in
his
contemplation
of
her
he
smiled
as
he
saw
this
and
in
a
tone
said
quietly
agnes
what
would
you
think
of
a
man
who
after
having
committed
little
else
but
folly
all
his
life
suddenly
made
up
his
mind
to
turn
absolutely
toward
the
right
and
to
pursue
it
in
face
of
every
obstacle
and
every
discouragement
i
should
think
she
slowly
replied
with
one
quick
lift
of
her
eyes
toward
his
face
that
he
had
entered
upon
the
noblest
effort
of
which
man
is
capable
and
the
hardest
i
should
have
great
sympathy
for
that
man
frederick
would
you
he
said
recalling
amabel
face
with
bitter
aversion
as
he
gazed
into
the
womanly
countenance
he
had
hitherto
slighted
as
uninteresting
it
is
the
first
kind
word
you
have
ever
given
me
agnes
possibly
it
is
the
first
i
have
ever
deserved
and
without
another
word
he
doffed
his
hat
saluted
her
and
vanished
down
the
hillside
she
remained
remained
so
long
that
it
was
nearly
nine
when
she
entered
the
family
parlour
as
she
came
in
her
mother
looked
up
and
was
startled
at
her
unaccustomed
pallor
why
agnes
cried
her
mother
what
is
the
matter
her
answer
was
inaudible
what
was
the
matter
she
dreaded
even
feared
to
ask
herself
meantime
a
strange
scene
was
taking
place
in
the
woods
toward
which
she
had
seen
frederick
go
the
moon
which
was
particularly
bright
that
night
shone
upon
a
certain
hollow
where
a
huge
tree
lay
around
it
the
underbrush
was
thick
and
the
shadow
dark
but
in
this
especial
place
the
opening
was
large
enough
for
the
rays
to
enter
freely
into
this
circlet
of
light
frederick
sutherland
had
come
alone
and
without
the
restraint
imposed
upon
him
by
watching
eyes
he
showed
a
countenance
so
wan
and
full
of
trouble
that
it
was
well
it
could
not
be
seen
by
either
of
the
two
women
whose
thoughts
were
at
that
moment
fixed
upon
him
to
amabel
it
would
have
given
a
throb
of
selfish
hope
while
to
agnes
it
would
have
brought
a
pang
of
despair
which
might
have
somewhat
too
suddenly
interpreted
to
her
the
mystery
of
her
own
sensations
he
had
bent
at
once
to
the
hollow
space
made
by
the
outspreading
roots
just
mentioned
and
was
feeling
with
an
air
of
confidence
along
the
ground
for
something
he
had
every
reason
to
expect
to
find
when
the
shock
of
a
sudden
distrust
seized
him
and
he
flung
himself
down
in
terror
feeling
and
feeling
again
among
the
fallen
leaves
and
broken
twigs
till
a
full
realisation
of
his
misfortune
reached
him
and
he
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
the
place
was
empty
overwhelmed
at
his
loss
aghast
at
the
consequences
it
must
entail
upon
him
he
rose
in
a
trembling
sweat
crying
out
in
his
anger
and
dismay
she
has
been
here
she
has
taken
it
and
realising
for
the
first
time
the
subtlety
and
strength
of
the
antagonist
pitted
against
him
he
forgot
his
new
resolutions
and
even
that
old
promise
made
in
his
childhood
to
agatha
webb
and
uttered
oath
after
oath
cursing
himself
the
woman
and
what
she
had
done
till
a
casual
glance
at
the
heavens
overhead
in
which
the
liquid
moon
hung
calm
and
beautiful
recalled
him
to
himself
with
a
sense
of
shame
the
keener
that
it
was
a
new
sensation
in
his
breast
he
ceased
his
vain
repinings
and
turning
from
the
unhallowed
spot
made
his
way
with
deeper
and
deeper
misgivings
toward
a
home
made
hateful
to
him
now
by
the
presence
of
the
woman
who
was
thus
bent
upon
his
ruin
he
understood
her
now
he
rated
at
its
full
value
both
her
determination
and
her
power
and
had
she
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
carried
her
imprudence
to
the
point
of
surprising
him
by
her
presence
it
would
have
taken
more
than
the
memory
of
that
day
solemn
resolves
to
have
kept
him
from
using
his
strength
against
her
but
she
was
wise
and
did
not
intrude
upon
him
in
his
hour
of
anger
though
who
could
say
she
was
not
near
enough
to
hear
the
sigh
which
broke
irresistibly
from
his
lips
as
he
emerged
from
the
wood
and
approached
his
father
house
a
lamp
was
still
burning
in
sutherland
study
over
the
front
door
and
the
sight
of
it
seemed
to
change
for
a
moment
the
current
of
frederick
thoughts
pausing
at
the
gate
he
considered
with
himself
and
then
with
a
freer
countenance
and
a
lighter
step
was
about
to
proceed
inward
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
heavy
breather
coming
up
the
hill
and
hesitated
why
he
hardly
knew
except
that
every
advancing
step
occasioned
him
more
or
less
apprehension
the
person
whoever
it
was
stopped
before
reaching
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
panting
heavily
muttered
an
oath
which
frederick
heard
though
it
was
no
more
profane
than
those
which
had
just
escaped
his
own
lips
in
the
forest
it
produced
an
effect
upon
him
which
was
only
second
in
intensity
to
the
terror
of
the
discovery
that
the
money
he
had
so
safely
hidden
was
gone
trembling
in
every
limb
he
dashed
down
the
hill
and
confronted
the
person
standing
there
you
he
cried
you
and
for
a
moment
he
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
fell
to
the
ground
the
man
before
him
but
this
man
was
a
heavyweight
of
no
ordinary
physical
strength
and
adroitness
and
only
smiled
at
frederick
heat
and
threatening
attitude
i
thought
i
would
be
made
welcome
he
smiled
with
just
the
hint
of
sinister
meaning
in
his
tone
then
before
frederick
could
speak
i
have
merely
saved
you
a
trip
to
boston
why
so
much
anger
friend
you
have
the
money
of
that
i
am
positive
hush
we
ca
talk
here
whispered
frederick
come
into
the
grounds
or
what
would
be
better
into
the
woods
over
there
i
do
go
into
any
woods
with
you
laughed
the
other
not
after
last
night
my
friend
but
i
will
talk
low
that
no
more
than
fair
i
want
to
put
you
into
any
other
man
power
especially
if
you
have
the
money
wattles
frederick
tone
was
broken
almost
unintelligible
what
do
you
mean
by
your
allusion
to
last
night
have
you
dared
to
connect
me
pooh
pooh
interrupted
the
other
do
let
us
waste
words
over
a
chance
expression
i
may
have
dropped
i
do
care
anything
about
last
night
work
or
who
was
concerned
in
it
nothing
to
me
all
i
want
my
boy
is
the
money
and
that
i
want
devilish
bad
or
i
would
not
have
run
up
here
from
boston
when
i
might
have
made
half
a
hundred
off
a
countryman
lewis
brought
in
from
the
canada
wilds
this
morning
wattles
i
swear
but
the
hand
he
had
raised
was
quickly
drawn
down
by
the
other
do
said
the
older
man
shortly
it
wo
pay
sutherland
never
passed
for
anything
with
me
besides
your
white
face
tells
a
truer
story
than
your
lips
and
time
is
precious
i
want
to
take
the
train
back
so
down
with
the
cash
nine
hundred
and
it
is
but
being
friends
we
will
let
the
odd
five
go
wattles
i
was
to
bring
it
to
you
or
was
it
the
next
day
i
do
not
want
to
give
it
to
you
indeed
i
can
not
but
wattles
wait
stop
where
are
you
going
to
see
your
father
i
want
to
tell
him
that
his
son
owes
me
a
debt
that
this
debt
was
incurred
in
a
way
that
lays
him
liable
to
arrest
for
forgery
that
bad
as
he
thinks
you
there
are
facts
which
can
be
picked
up
in
boston
which
would
render
frederick
sutherland
continued
residence
under
the
parental
roof
impossible
that
in
fact
you
are
a
scamp
of
the
first
water
and
that
only
my
friendship
for
you
has
kept
you
out
of
prison
so
long
wo
that
make
a
nice
story
for
the
old
gentleman
ears
wattles
i
oh
my
god
wattles
stop
a
minute
and
listen
to
me
i
have
not
got
the
money
i
had
enough
this
morning
to
pay
you
had
it
legitimately
wattles
but
it
has
been
stolen
from
me
and
i
will
also
tell
him
the
other
broke
in
as
quietly
as
if
frederick
had
not
uttered
a
word
that
in
a
certain
visit
to
boston
you
lost
five
hundred
dollars
on
one
hand
that
you
lost
it
unfairly
not
having
a
dollar
to
pay
with
that
to
prevent
scandal
i
became
your
security
with
the
understanding
that
i
was
to
be
paid
at
the
end
of
ten
days
from
that
night
that
you
thereupon
played
again
and
lost
four
hundred
and
odd
more
so
that
your
debt
amounted
to
nine
hundred
and
dollars
that
the
ten
days
passed
without
payment
that
wanting
money
i
pressed
you
and
even
resorted
to
a
threat
or
two
and
that
seeing
me
in
earnest
you
swore
that
the
dollars
should
be
mine
within
five
days
that
instead
of
remaining
in
boston
to
get
them
you
came
here
and
that
this
morning
at
a
very
early
hour
you
telegraphed
that
the
funds
were
to
hand
and
that
you
would
bring
them
down
to
me
the
old
gentleman
may
draw
conclusions
from
this
sutherland
which
may
make
his
position
as
your
father
anything
but
grateful
to
him
he
may
even
ah
you
would
try
that
game
would
you
the
young
man
had
flung
himself
at
the
older
man
throat
as
if
he
would
choke
off
the
words
he
saw
trembling
on
his
lips
but
the
struggle
thus
begun
was
short
in
a
moment
both
stood
panting
and
frederick
with
lowered
head
was
saying
humbly
i
beg
pardon
wattles
but
you
drive
me
mad
with
your
suggestions
and
conclusions
i
have
not
got
the
money
but
i
will
try
and
get
it
wait
here
for
ten
minutes
sutherland
no
longer
the
moon
is
bright
and
i
can
see
the
hands
of
my
watch
distinctly
at
a
quarter
to
ten
you
will
return
here
with
the
amount
i
have
mentioned
or
i
will
seek
it
at
your
father
hands
in
his
own
study
frederick
made
a
hurried
gesture
and
vanished
up
the
walk
next
moment
he
was
at
his
father
study
door
xiii
wattles
goes
sutherland
was
busily
engaged
with
a
law
paper
when
his
son
entered
his
presence
but
at
sight
of
that
son
face
he
dropped
the
paper
with
an
alacrity
which
frederick
was
too
much
engaged
with
his
own
thoughts
to
notice
father
he
began
without
preamble
or
excuse
i
am
in
serious
and
immediate
need
of
nine
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
i
want
it
so
much
that
i
ask
you
to
make
me
a
check
for
that
amount
conscious
though
i
am
that
you
have
every
right
to
deny
me
this
request
and
that
my
debt
to
you
already
passes
the
bound
of
presumption
on
my
part
and
indulgence
on
yours
i
can
not
tell
you
why
i
want
it
or
for
what
that
belongs
to
my
past
life
the
consequences
of
which
i
have
not
yet
escaped
but
i
feel
bound
to
state
that
you
will
not
be
the
loser
by
this
material
proof
of
confidence
in
me
as
i
shall
soon
be
in
a
position
to
repay
all
my
debts
among
which
this
will
necessarily
stand
foremost
the
old
gentleman
looked
startled
and
nervously
fingered
the
paper
he
had
let
fall
why
do
you
say
you
will
soon
be
in
a
position
to
repay
me
what
do
you
mean
by
that
the
flash
which
had
not
yet
subsided
from
the
young
man
face
ebbed
slowly
away
as
he
encountered
his
father
eye
i
mean
to
work
he
murmured
i
mean
to
make
a
man
of
myself
as
soon
as
possible
the
look
which
sutherland
gave
him
was
more
inquiring
than
sympathetic
and
you
need
this
money
for
a
start
said
he
frederick
bowed
he
seemed
to
be
losing
the
faculty
of
speech
the
clock
over
the
mantel
had
told
off
five
of
the
precious
moments
i
will
give
it
to
you
said
his
father
and
drew
out
his
but
he
did
not
hasten
to
open
it
his
eyes
still
rested
on
his
son
now
murmured
the
young
man
there
is
a
train
leaving
soon
i
wish
to
get
it
away
on
that
train
his
father
frowned
with
natural
distrust
i
wish
you
would
confide
in
me
said
he
frederick
did
not
answer
the
hands
of
the
clock
were
moving
on
i
will
give
it
to
you
but
i
should
like
to
know
what
for
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
tell
you
groaned
the
young
man
starting
as
he
heard
a
step
on
the
walk
without
your
need
has
become
strangely
imperative
proceeded
the
other
has
miss
page
frederick
took
a
step
forward
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
father
arm
it
is
not
for
her
he
whispered
it
goes
into
other
hands
sutherland
who
had
turned
over
the
document
as
his
son
approached
breathed
more
easily
taking
up
his
pen
he
dipped
it
in
the
ink
frederick
watched
him
with
constantly
whitening
cheek
the
step
on
the
walk
had
mounted
to
the
front
door
nine
hundred
and
fifty
inquired
the
father
nine
hundred
and
fifty
answered
the
son
the
judge
with
a
last
look
stooped
over
the
book
the
hands
of
the
clock
pointed
to
a
quarter
to
ten
father
i
have
my
whole
future
in
which
to
thank
you
cried
frederick
seizing
the
check
his
father
held
out
to
him
and
making
rapidly
for
the
door
i
will
be
back
before
midnight
and
he
flung
himself
just
as
the
front
door
opened
and
wattles
stepped
in
ah
exclaimed
the
latter
as
his
eye
fell
on
the
paper
fluttering
in
the
other
hand
i
expected
money
not
paper
the
paper
is
good
answered
frederick
drawing
him
swiftly
out
of
the
house
it
has
my
father
signature
upon
it
your
father
signature
yes
wattles
gave
it
a
look
then
slowly
shook
his
head
at
frederick
is
it
as
well
done
as
the
one
you
tried
to
pass
off
on
brady
frederick
cringed
and
for
a
moment
looked
as
if
the
struggle
was
too
much
for
him
then
he
rallied
and
eying
wattles
firmly
said
you
have
a
right
to
distrust
me
but
you
are
on
the
wrong
track
wattles
what
i
did
once
i
can
never
do
again
and
i
hope
i
may
live
to
prove
myself
a
changed
man
as
for
that
check
i
will
soon
prove
its
value
in
your
eyes
follow
me
to
my
father
his
energy
the
energy
of
despair
no
doubt
seemed
to
make
an
impression
on
the
other
you
might
as
well
proclaim
yourself
a
forger
outright
as
to
force
your
father
to
declare
this
to
be
his
signature
he
observed
i
know
it
said
frederick
yet
you
will
run
that
risk
if
you
oblige
me
wattles
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
was
a
man
and
towered
in
that
old
colonial
hall
like
a
youthful
giant
i
bear
you
no
ill
will
said
he
if
this
represents
money
i
am
satisfied
and
i
begin
to
think
it
does
but
listen
sutherland
something
has
happened
to
you
a
week
ago
you
would
have
put
a
bullet
through
my
head
before
you
would
have
been
willing
to
have
so
compromised
yourself
i
think
i
know
what
that
something
is
to
save
yourself
from
being
thought
guilty
of
a
big
crime
you
are
willing
to
incur
suspicion
of
a
small
one
it
a
wise
move
my
boy
but
look
out
no
tricks
with
me
or
my
friendship
may
not
hold
meantime
i
cash
this
check
and
he
swung
away
through
the
night
with
a
selection
on
his
lips
xiv
a
final
temptation
frederick
looked
like
a
man
thoroughly
exhausted
when
the
final
echo
of
this
hateful
voice
died
away
on
the
hillside
for
the
last
twenty
hours
he
had
been
the
prey
of
one
harrowing
emotion
after
another
and
human
nature
could
endure
no
more
without
rest
but
rest
would
not
come
the
position
in
which
he
found
himself
between
amabel
and
the
man
who
had
just
left
was
of
too
threatening
a
nature
for
him
to
ignore
but
one
means
of
escape
presented
itself
it
was
a
cowardly
one
but
anything
was
better
than
to
make
an
attempt
to
stand
his
ground
against
two
such
merciless
antagonists
so
he
resolved
upon
flight
packing
up
a
few
necessaries
and
leaving
a
letter
behind
him
for
his
father
he
made
his
way
down
the
stairs
of
the
now
darkened
house
to
a
door
opening
upon
the
garden
to
his
astonishment
he
found
it
unlocked
but
giving
little
heed
to
this
in
his
excitement
he
opened
it
with
caution
and
with
a
parting
sigh
for
the
sheltering
home
he
was
about
to
leave
forever
stepped
from
the
house
he
no
longer
felt
worthy
to
inhabit
his
intention
was
to
take
the
train
at
portchester
and
that
he
might
reach
that
place
without
inconvenient
encounters
he
decided
to
proceed
by
a
short
cut
through
the
fields
this
led
him
north
along
the
ridge
that
overlooks
the
road
running
around
the
base
of
the
hill
he
did
not
think
of
this
road
however
or
of
anything
in
fact
but
the
necessity
of
taking
the
very
earliest
train
out
of
portchester
as
this
left
at
he
realised
that
he
must
hasten
in
order
to
reach
it
but
he
was
not
destined
to
take
it
or
any
other
train
out
of
portchester
that
night
for
when
he
reached
the
fence
dividing
sutherland
grounds
from
those
of
his
adjoining
neighbour
he
saw
drawn
up
in
the
moonlight
just
at
the
point
where
he
had
intended
to
leap
the
fence
the
form
of
a
woman
with
one
hand
held
out
to
stop
him
it
was
amabel
confounded
by
this
check
and
filled
with
an
anger
that
was
nigh
to
dangerous
he
fell
back
and
then
immediately
sprang
forward
what
are
you
doing
here
he
cried
do
you
know
that
it
is
eleven
and
that
my
father
requires
the
house
to
be
closed
at
that
hour
and
you
was
her
sole
retort
what
are
you
doing
here
are
you
searching
for
flowers
in
the
woods
and
is
that
valise
you
carry
the
receptacle
in
which
you
hope
to
put
your
botanical
specimens
with
a
savage
gesture
he
dropped
the
valise
and
took
her
fiercely
by
the
shoulders
where
have
you
hidden
my
money
he
hissed
tell
me
or
or
what
she
asked
smiling
into
his
face
in
a
way
that
made
him
lose
his
grip
or
or
i
can
not
answer
for
myself
he
proceeded
stammering
do
you
think
i
can
endure
everything
from
you
because
you
are
a
woman
no
i
will
have
those
bills
every
one
of
them
or
show
myself
your
master
where
are
they
you
incarnate
fiend
it
was
an
unwise
word
to
use
but
she
did
not
seem
to
heed
it
ah
she
said
softly
and
with
a
lingering
accent
as
if
his
grasp
of
her
had
been
a
caress
to
which
she
was
not
entirely
averse
i
did
not
think
you
would
discover
its
loss
so
soon
when
did
you
go
to
the
woods
frederick
and
was
miss
halliday
with
you
he
had
a
disposition
to
strike
her
but
controlled
himself
blows
would
not
avail
against
the
softness
of
this
suave
yet
merciless
being
only
a
will
as
strong
as
her
own
could
hope
to
cope
with
this
smiling
fury
and
this
he
was
determined
to
show
though
alas
he
had
everything
to
lose
in
a
struggle
that
robbed
her
of
nothing
but
a
hope
which
was
but
a
baseless
fabric
at
best
for
he
was
more
than
ever
determined
never
to
marry
her
a
man
does
not
need
to
wait
long
to
miss
his
own
said
he
and
if
you
have
taken
this
money
which
you
do
not
deny
you
have
shown
yourself
very
for
danger
lies
closer
to
the
person
holding
this
money
than
to
the
one
you
vilify
by
your
threats
this
you
will
find
amabel
when
you
come
to
make
use
of
the
weapon
with
which
you
have
thought
to
arm
yourself
tut
tut
was
her
contemptuous
reply
do
you
consider
me
a
child
do
i
look
like
a
babbling
infant
frederick
her
face
which
had
been
lifted
to
his
in
saying
this
was
so
illumined
both
by
her
smile
which
was
strangely
enchanting
for
one
so
evil
and
by
the
moonlight
which
so
etherialises
all
that
it
touches
that
he
found
himself
forced
to
recall
that
other
purer
truer
face
he
had
left
at
the
honeysuckle
porch
to
keep
down
a
last
wild
impulse
toward
her
which
would
have
been
his
undoing
both
in
this
world
and
the
next
as
he
knew
or
do
i
look
simply
like
a
woman
she
went
on
seeing
the
impression
she
had
made
and
playing
upon
it
a
woman
who
understands
herself
and
you
and
all
the
secret
perils
of
the
game
we
are
both
playing
if
i
am
a
child
treat
me
as
a
child
but
if
i
am
a
woman
stand
out
of
my
way
he
cried
catching
up
his
valise
and
striding
furiously
by
her
woman
or
child
know
that
i
will
not
be
your
plaything
to
be
damned
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
are
you
bound
for
the
city
of
destruction
she
laughed
not
moving
but
showing
such
confidence
in
her
power
to
hold
him
back
that
he
stopped
in
spite
of
himself
if
so
you
are
taking
the
direct
road
there
and
have
only
to
hasten
but
you
had
better
remain
in
your
father
house
even
if
you
are
something
of
a
prisoner
there
like
my
very
insignificant
self
the
outcome
will
be
more
satisfactory
even
if
you
have
to
share
your
future
with
me
and
what
course
will
you
take
he
asked
pausing
with
his
hand
on
the
fence
if
i
decide
to
choose
destruction
without
you
rather
than
perdition
with
you
what
course
why
i
shall
tell
talbot
just
enough
to
show
you
to
be
as
desirable
a
witness
in
the
impending
inquest
as
myself
the
result
i
leave
to
your
judgment
but
you
will
not
drive
me
to
this
extremity
you
will
come
back
and
woman
i
will
never
come
back
i
shall
have
to
dare
your
worst
in
a
week
and
will
begin
by
daring
you
now
i
but
he
did
not
leap
the
fence
though
he
made
a
move
to
do
so
for
at
that
moment
a
party
of
men
came
hurrying
by
on
the
lower
road
one
of
whom
was
heard
to
say
i
will
bet
my
head
that
we
will
put
our
hand
on
agatha
webb
murderer
the
man
who
shoves
bills
around
so
heedlessly
should
not
wear
a
beard
so
long
it
leads
to
detection
it
was
the
coroner
the
constable
knapp
and
abel
on
their
way
to
the
forest
road
on
which
lived
john
and
james
zabel
frederick
and
amabel
confronted
each
other
and
after
a
moment
silence
returned
as
if
by
a
common
impulse
towards
the
house
what
have
they
got
in
their
heads
queried
she
whatever
it
is
it
may
serve
to
occupy
them
till
the
week
of
your
probation
is
over
he
did
not
answer
a
new
and
overwhelming
complication
had
been
added
to
the
difficulties
of
his
situation
xv
the
zabels
visited
let
us
follow
the
party
now
winding
up
the
hillside
in
a
deeply
wooded
spot
on
a
side
road
stood
the
little
house
to
which
john
and
james
zabel
had
removed
when
their
business
on
the
docks
had
terminated
there
was
no
other
dwelling
of
greater
or
lesser
pretension
on
the
road
which
may
account
for
the
fact
that
none
of
the
persons
now
approaching
it
had
been
in
that
neighbourhood
for
years
though
it
was
by
no
means
a
long
walk
from
the
village
in
which
they
all
led
such
busy
lives
the
heavy
shadows
cast
by
the
woods
through
which
the
road
meandered
were
not
without
their
effect
upon
the
spirits
of
the
four
men
passing
through
them
so
that
long
before
they
reached
the
opening
in
which
the
zabel
cottage
stood
silence
had
fallen
upon
the
whole
party
talbot
especially
looked
as
if
he
little
relished
this
late
visit
to
his
old
friends
and
not
till
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
long
sloping
roof
and
heavy
chimney
of
the
zabel
cottage
did
he
shake
off
the
gloom
incident
to
the
nature
of
his
errand
gentlemen
said
he
coming
to
a
sudden
halt
let
us
understand
each
other
we
are
about
to
make
a
call
on
two
of
our
oldest
and
most
respectable
townsfolk
if
in
the
course
of
that
call
i
choose
to
make
mention
of
the
bill
left
with
loton
well
and
good
but
if
not
you
are
to
take
my
reticence
as
proof
of
my
own
belief
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
two
of
the
party
bowed
knapp
only
made
no
sign
there
is
no
light
in
the
window
observed
abel
what
if
we
find
them
gone
to
bed
we
will
wake
them
said
the
constable
i
can
not
go
back
without
being
myself
assured
that
no
more
money
like
that
given
to
loton
remains
in
the
house
very
well
remarked
knapp
and
going
up
to
the
door
before
him
he
struck
a
resounding
knock
sufficiently
startling
in
that
place
of
silence
but
loud
as
the
summons
was
it
brought
no
answer
not
only
the
door
but
the
little
windows
on
each
side
of
it
remained
shut
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
knock
had
been
heard
zabel
john
zabel
shouted
the
constable
stepping
around
the
side
of
the
house
get
up
my
good
friends
and
let
an
old
crony
in
james
john
late
as
it
is
we
have
business
with
you
open
the
door
stop
to
dress
but
this
appeal
received
no
more
recognition
than
the
first
and
after
rapping
on
the
window
against
which
he
had
flung
the
words
he
came
back
and
looked
up
and
down
the
front
of
the
house
it
had
a
solitary
aspect
and
was
much
less
than
he
had
expected
indeed
there
were
signs
of
poverty
or
at
least
of
neglect
about
the
place
that
astonished
him
not
only
had
the
weeds
been
allowed
to
grow
over
the
doorstep
but
from
the
unpainted
front
itself
bits
of
boards
had
rotted
away
leaving
great
gaps
about
the
and
at
the
base
of
the
sunken
and
toppling
chimney
the
moon
flooding
the
roof
showed
up
all
these
imperfections
with
pitiless
insistence
and
the
torn
edges
of
the
green
paper
shades
that
half
concealed
the
rooms
within
were
plainly
to
be
seen
as
well
as
the
dismantled
knocker
which
hung
by
one
nail
to
the
old
cracked
door
the
vision
of
knapp
with
his
ear
laid
against
this
door
added
to
the
forlorn
and
sinister
aspect
of
the
scene
and
gave
to
the
constable
who
remembered
the
brothers
in
their
palmy
days
when
they
were
the
life
and
pride
of
the
town
a
by
no
means
agreeable
sensation
as
he
advanced
toward
the
detective
and
asked
him
what
they
should
do
now
break
down
the
door
was
the
uncompromising
reply
or
wait
the
windows
of
country
houses
are
seldom
fastened
let
me
see
if
i
can
not
enter
by
some
one
of
them
better
not
said
the
coroner
with
considerable
feeling
let
us
exhaust
all
other
means
first
and
he
took
hold
of
the
knob
of
the
door
to
shake
it
when
to
his
surprise
it
turned
and
the
door
opened
it
had
not
been
locked
rather
taken
aback
by
this
he
hesitated
but
knapp
showed
less
scruple
without
waiting
for
any
man
permission
he
glided
in
and
stepped
cautiously
but
without
any
delay
into
a
room
the
door
of
which
stood
wide
open
before
him
the
constable
was
about
to
follow
when
he
saw
knapp
come
stumbling
back
devilish
work
he
muttered
and
drew
the
others
in
to
see
never
will
any
of
these
men
forget
the
sight
that
there
met
their
eyes
on
the
floor
near
the
entrance
lay
one
brother
in
a
streak
of
moonlight
which
showed
every
feature
of
his
worn
and
lifeless
face
and
at
a
table
drawn
up
in
the
centre
of
the
room
sat
the
other
rigid
in
death
with
a
book
clutched
in
his
hand
both
had
been
dead
some
time
and
on
the
faces
and
in
the
aspects
of
both
was
visible
a
misery
that
added
its
own
gloom
to
the
pitiable
and
gruesome
scene
and
made
the
shining
of
the
great
white
moon
which
filled
every
corner
of
the
bare
room
seem
a
mockery
unendurable
to
those
who
contemplated
it
john
dead
in
his
chair
james
dead
on
the
floor
knapp
who
of
all
present
was
least
likely
to
feel
the
awesome
nature
of
the
tragedy
was
naturally
the
first
to
speak
both
wear
long
beards
said
he
but
the
one
lying
on
the
floor
was
doubtless
loton
customer
ah
he
cried
pointing
at
the
table
as
he
carefully
crossed
the
floor
here
is
the
bread
and
even
he
had
his
moments
of
feeling
the
appearance
of
that
loaf
had
stunned
him
one
corner
of
it
had
been
gnawed
off
a
light
let
us
have
a
light
cried
fenton
speaking
for
the
first
time
since
his
entrance
these
moonbeams
are
horrible
see
how
they
cling
to
the
bodies
as
if
they
delighted
in
lighting
up
these
wasted
and
shrunken
forms
could
it
have
been
hunger
began
abel
tremblingly
following
every
movement
as
he
struck
a
match
and
lit
a
lantern
which
he
had
brought
in
his
pocket
god
help
us
all
if
it
was
said
fenton
in
a
secret
remorse
no
one
but
talbot
understood
but
who
could
have
believed
it
of
men
who
were
once
so
prosperous
are
you
sure
that
one
of
them
has
gnawed
this
bread
could
it
not
have
been
these
are
the
marks
of
human
teeth
observed
knapp
who
was
examining
the
loaf
carefully
i
declare
it
makes
me
very
uncomfortable
notwithstanding
it
in
the
line
of
regular
experiences
and
he
laid
the
bread
down
hurriedly
meantime
fenton
who
had
been
bending
over
another
portion
of
the
table
turned
and
walked
away
to
the
window
i
am
glad
they
are
dead
he
muttered
they
have
at
least
shared
the
fate
of
their
victims
take
a
look
under
that
old
handkerchief
lying
beside
the
newspaper
knapp
the
detective
did
so
a
dagger
with
a
curiously
wrought
handle
met
his
eye
it
had
blood
dried
on
its
point
and
was
as
all
could
see
the
weapon
with
which
agatha
webb
had
been
killed
xyi
local
talent
at
work
gentlemen
we
have
reached
the
conclusion
of
this
business
sooner
than
i
expected
announced
knapp
if
you
will
give
me
just
ten
minutes
i
will
endeavour
to
find
that
large
remainder
of
money
we
have
every
reason
to
think
is
hidden
away
in
this
house
stop
a
minute
said
the
coroner
let
me
see
what
book
john
is
holding
so
tightly
why
he
exclaimed
drawing
it
out
and
giving
it
one
glance
it
is
a
bible
laying
it
reverently
down
he
met
the
detective
astonished
glance
and
seriously
remarked
there
is
some
incongruity
between
the
presence
of
this
book
and
the
deed
we
believe
to
have
been
performed
down
yonder
none
at
all
quoth
the
detective
it
was
not
the
man
in
the
chair
but
the
one
on
the
floor
who
made
use
of
that
dagger
but
i
wish
you
had
left
it
to
me
to
remove
that
book
sir
you
and
why
what
difference
would
it
have
made
i
would
have
noticed
between
what
pages
his
finger
was
inserted
nothing
like
making
yourself
acquainted
with
every
detail
in
a
case
like
this
talbot
gazed
wistfully
at
the
book
he
would
have
liked
to
know
himself
on
what
especial
passage
his
friend
eyes
had
last
rested
i
will
stand
aside
said
he
and
hear
your
report
when
you
are
done
the
detective
had
already
begun
his
investigations
here
is
a
spot
of
blood
said
he
see
on
the
right
trouser
leg
of
the
one
you
call
james
this
connects
him
indisputably
with
the
crime
in
which
this
dagger
was
used
no
signs
of
violence
on
his
body
she
was
the
only
one
to
receive
a
blow
his
death
is
the
result
of
providence
or
man
neglect
muttered
the
constable
there
is
no
money
in
any
of
their
pockets
or
on
either
wasted
figure
the
detective
continued
after
a
few
minutes
of
silent
search
it
must
be
hidden
in
the
room
or
look
through
that
bible
sirs
the
coroner
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
do
something
took
up
the
book
and
ran
hurriedly
through
its
leaves
then
turned
it
and
shook
it
out
over
the
table
nothing
fell
out
the
bills
must
be
looked
for
elsewhere
the
furniture
is
scanty
abel
observed
with
an
inquiring
look
about
him
very
very
scanty
assented
the
constable
still
with
that
biting
remorse
at
his
heart
there
is
nothing
in
this
cupboard
pursued
the
detective
swinging
open
a
door
in
the
wall
but
a
set
of
old
china
more
or
less
nicked
abel
started
an
old
recollection
had
come
up
some
weeks
before
he
had
been
present
when
james
had
made
an
effort
to
sell
this
set
they
were
all
in
warner
store
and
james
zabel
he
could
see
his
easy
attitude
yet
and
hear
the
tones
with
which
he
tried
to
carry
the
affair
off
had
said
quite
as
if
he
had
never
thought
of
it
before
by
the
by
i
have
a
set
of
china
at
the
house
which
came
over
in
the
mayflower
john
likes
it
but
it
has
grown
to
be
an
eyesore
to
me
and
if
you
hear
of
anybody
who
has
a
fancy
for
such
things
send
him
up
to
the
cottage
i
will
let
it
go
for
a
song
nobody
answered
and
james
disappeared
it
was
the
last
time
abel
remembered
that
he
had
been
seen
about
town
i
ca
stand
it
cried
the
lad
i
ca
stand
it
if
they
died
of
hunger
i
must
know
it
i
am
going
to
take
a
look
at
their
larder
and
before
anyone
could
stop
him
he
dashed
to
the
rear
of
the
house
the
constable
would
have
liked
to
follow
him
but
he
looked
about
the
walls
of
the
room
instead
john
and
james
had
been
fond
of
pictures
and
had
once
indulged
their
fancy
to
the
verge
of
extravagance
but
there
were
no
pictures
on
the
walls
now
nor
was
there
so
much
as
a
candlestick
on
the
empty
and
mantel
only
on
a
bracket
in
one
corner
there
was
a
worthless
trinket
made
out
of
cloves
and
beads
which
had
doubtless
been
given
them
by
some
country
damsel
in
their
young
bachelor
days
but
nothing
of
any
value
anywhere
and
fenton
felt
that
he
now
knew
why
they
had
made
so
many
visits
to
boston
at
one
time
and
why
they
always
returned
with
a
thinner
valise
than
they
took
away
he
was
still
dwelling
on
the
thought
of
the
depths
of
misery
to
which
highly
respectable
folks
can
sink
without
the
knowledge
of
the
nearest
neighbours
when
abel
came
back
looking
greatly
troubled
it
is
the
saddest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
said
he
these
men
must
have
been
driven
wild
by
misery
this
room
is
sumptuous
in
comparison
to
the
ones
at
the
back
and
as
for
the
pantry
there
is
not
even
a
scrap
there
a
mouse
could
eat
i
struck
a
match
and
glanced
into
the
flour
barrel
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
licked
i
declare
it
makes
a
fellow
feel
sick
the
constable
with
a
shudder
withdrew
towards
the
door
the
atmosphere
here
is
stifling
said
he
i
must
have
a
breath
of
air
but
he
was
not
destined
to
any
such
immediate
relief
as
he
moved
down
the
hall
the
form
of
a
man
darkened
the
doorway
and
he
heard
an
anxious
voice
exclaim
ah
fenton
is
that
you
i
have
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
it
was
sweetwater
the
young
man
who
had
previously
shown
so
much
anxiety
to
be
of
service
to
the
coroner
fenton
looked
displeased
and
how
came
you
to
find
me
here
he
asked
oh
some
men
saw
you
take
this
road
and
i
guessed
the
rest
oh
ah
very
good
and
what
do
you
want
sweetwater
the
young
man
who
was
glowing
with
pride
and
all
alive
with
an
enthusiasm
which
he
had
kept
suppressed
for
hours
slipped
up
to
the
constable
and
whispered
in
his
ear
i
have
made
a
discovery
sir
i
know
you
will
excuse
the
presumption
but
i
could
bring
myself
to
keep
quiet
and
follow
in
that
other
fellow
wake
i
had
to
make
investigations
on
my
own
account
and
and
stammering
in
his
eagerness
they
have
been
successful
sir
i
have
found
out
who
was
the
murderer
of
agatha
webb
the
constable
compassionating
the
disappointment
in
store
for
him
shook
his
head
with
a
solemn
look
toward
the
room
from
which
he
had
just
emerged
you
are
late
sweetwater
said
he
we
have
found
him
out
ourselves
and
he
lies
there
dead
it
was
dark
where
they
stood
and
sweetwater
back
was
to
the
moonlight
so
that
the
blank
look
which
must
have
crossed
his
face
at
this
announcement
was
lost
upon
the
constable
but
his
consternation
was
evident
from
the
way
he
thrust
out
either
hand
to
steady
himself
against
the
walls
of
the
narrow
passageway
and
fenton
was
not
at
all
surprised
to
hear
him
stammer
out
dead
he
whom
do
you
mean
by
he
mr
fenton
the
man
in
whose
house
we
now
are
returned
the
other
is
there
anyone
else
who
can
be
suspected
of
this
crime
sweetwater
gave
a
gulp
that
seemed
to
restore
him
to
himself
there
are
two
men
living
here
both
very
good
men
i
have
heard
which
of
them
do
you
mean
and
why
do
you
think
that
either
john
or
james
zabel
killed
agatha
webb
for
reply
fenton
drew
him
toward
the
room
in
which
such
a
great
had
taken
place
look
said
he
and
see
what
can
happen
in
a
christian
land
in
the
midst
of
christian
people
living
not
fifty
rods
away
these
men
are
dead
sweetwater
dead
from
hunger
the
loaf
of
bread
you
see
there
came
too
late
it
was
bought
with
a
bill
taken
from
agatha
webb
cupboard
drawer
sweetwater
to
whom
the
whole
scene
seemed
like
some
horrible
nightmare
stared
at
the
figure
of
james
lying
on
the
floor
and
then
at
the
figure
of
john
seated
at
the
table
as
if
his
mind
had
failed
to
take
in
the
constable
words
dead
he
murmured
dead
john
and
james
zabel
what
will
happen
next
is
the
town
under
a
curse
and
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
prostrate
form
of
james
only
to
start
up
again
as
he
saw
the
eyes
of
knapp
resting
on
him
ah
he
muttered
the
detective
and
after
giving
the
man
from
boston
a
close
look
he
turned
toward
fenton
you
said
something
about
this
good
old
man
having
killed
agatha
webb
what
was
it
i
was
too
dazed
to
take
it
in
fenton
not
understanding
the
young
man
eagerness
but
willing
enough
to
enlighten
him
as
to
the
situation
told
him
what
reasons
there
were
for
ascribing
the
crime
in
the
webb
cottage
to
the
mad
need
of
these
starving
men
sweetwater
listened
with
open
eyes
and
confused
bearing
only
controlling
himself
when
his
eyes
by
chance
fell
upon
the
quiet
figure
of
the
detective
now
moving
softly
to
and
fro
through
the
room
but
why
murder
when
he
could
have
had
his
loaf
for
the
asking
remonstrated
sweetwater
agatha
webb
would
have
gone
without
a
meal
any
time
to
feed
a
wandering
tramp
how
much
more
to
supply
the
necessities
of
two
of
her
oldest
and
dearest
friends
yes
remarked
fenton
but
you
forget
or
perhaps
never
knew
that
the
master
passion
of
these
men
was
pride
james
zabel
ask
for
bread
i
can
much
sooner
imagine
him
stealing
it
yes
or
striking
a
blow
for
it
so
that
the
blow
shut
forever
the
eyes
that
saw
him
do
it
you
do
believe
your
own
words
fenton
how
can
you
sweetwater
hand
was
on
the
breast
of
the
accused
man
as
he
spoke
and
his
manner
was
almost
solemn
you
must
not
take
it
for
granted
he
went
on
his
green
eyes
twinkling
with
a
curious
light
that
all
wisdom
comes
from
boston
we
in
sutherlandtown
have
some
sparks
of
it
if
they
have
not
yet
been
recognised
you
are
satisfied
here
he
addressed
himself
to
knapp
that
the
blow
which
killed
agatha
webb
was
struck
by
this
respectable
old
man
knapp
smiled
as
if
a
child
had
asked
him
this
question
but
he
answered
him
enough
you
see
the
dagger
lying
here
with
which
the
deed
was
done
and
you
see
the
bread
that
was
bought
from
loton
with
a
bill
of
agatha
webb
money
in
these
you
can
read
my
answer
good
evidence
acknowledged
sweetwater
very
good
evidence
especially
when
we
remember
that
crane
met
an
old
man
rushing
from
her
gateway
with
something
glittering
in
his
hand
i
never
was
so
beat
in
my
life
and
yet
and
yet
if
i
could
have
a
few
minutes
of
quiet
thought
all
by
myself
i
am
certain
i
could
show
you
that
there
is
more
to
this
matter
than
you
think
indeed
i
know
that
there
is
but
i
do
not
like
to
give
my
reasons
till
i
have
conquered
the
difficulties
presented
by
these
men
having
had
the
bill
what
fellow
is
this
suddenly
broke
in
knapp
a
fiddler
a
nobody
quietly
whispered
fenton
in
his
ear
sweetwater
heard
him
and
changed
in
a
twinkling
from
the
uncertain
wholly
humble
person
they
had
just
seen
to
a
man
with
a
purpose
strong
enough
to
make
him
hold
up
his
head
with
the
best
i
am
a
musician
he
admitted
and
i
play
on
the
violin
for
money
whenever
the
occasion
offers
something
which
you
will
yet
congratulate
yourselves
upon
if
you
wish
to
reach
the
root
of
this
mysterious
and
dastardly
crime
but
that
i
am
a
nobody
i
deny
and
i
even
dare
to
hope
that
you
will
agree
with
me
in
this
estimate
of
myself
before
this
very
night
is
over
only
give
me
an
opportunity
for
considering
this
subject
and
the
permission
to
walk
for
a
few
minutes
about
this
house
that
is
my
prerogative
protested
the
detective
firmly
but
without
any
display
of
feeling
i
am
the
man
employed
to
pick
up
whatever
clews
the
place
may
present
have
you
picked
up
all
that
are
to
be
found
in
this
room
asked
sweetwater
calmly
knapp
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
was
very
well
satisfied
with
himself
then
give
me
a
chance
prayed
sweetwater
fenton
he
urged
more
earnestly
i
am
not
the
fool
you
take
me
for
i
feel
i
know
i
have
a
genius
for
this
kind
of
thing
and
though
i
am
not
prepossessing
to
look
at
and
though
i
do
play
the
fiddle
i
swear
there
are
depths
to
this
affair
which
none
of
you
have
as
yet
sounded
sirs
where
are
the
nine
hundred
and
eighty
dollars
in
bills
which
go
to
make
up
the
clean
thousand
that
was
taken
from
the
small
drawer
at
the
back
of
agatha
webb
cupboard
they
are
in
some
secret
no
doubt
which
we
will
presently
come
upon
as
we
go
through
the
house
answered
knapp
umph
then
i
advise
you
to
put
your
hand
on
them
as
soon
as
possible
retorted
sweetwater
i
will
confine
myself
to
going
over
the
ground
you
have
already
investigated
and
with
a
sudden
ignoring
of
the
presence
which
could
only
have
sprung
from
an
intense
egotism
or
from
an
overwhelming
belief
in
his
own
theory
he
began
an
investigation
of
the
room
that
threw
the
other
more
commonplace
efforts
entirely
in
the
shade
knapp
with
a
slight
compression
of
his
lips
which
was
the
sole
expression
of
anger
he
ever
allowed
himself
took
up
his
hat
and
made
his
bow
to
fenton
i
see
said
he
that
the
sympathy
of
those
present
is
with
local
talent
let
local
talent
work
then
sir
and
when
you
feel
the
need
of
a
man
of
training
and
experience
send
to
the
tavern
on
the
docks
where
i
will
be
found
till
i
am
notified
that
my
services
are
no
longer
required
no
no
protested
fenton
this
boy
enthusiasm
will
soon
evaporate
let
him
fuss
away
if
he
will
his
petty
business
need
not
interrupt
us
but
he
understands
himself
whispered
knapp
i
should
think
he
had
been
on
our
own
force
for
years
all
the
more
reason
to
see
what
he
up
to
wait
if
only
to
satisfy
your
curiosity
i
sha
let
many
minutes
go
by
before
i
pull
him
up
knapp
who
was
really
of
a
cold
and
unimpressionable
temperament
refrained
from
further
argument
and
confined
himself
to
watching
the
young
man
whose
movements
seemed
to
fascinate
him
astonishing
fenton
heard
him
mutter
to
himself
he
more
like
an
eel
than
a
man
and
indeed
the
way
sweetwater
wound
himself
out
and
in
through
that
room
seeing
everything
that
came
under
his
eye
was
a
sight
well
worth
any
professional
attention
pausing
before
the
dead
man
on
the
floor
he
held
the
lantern
close
to
the
white
worn
face
ha
said
he
picking
something
from
the
long
beard
here
a
crumb
of
that
same
bread
did
you
see
that
mr
knapp
the
question
was
so
sudden
and
so
sharp
that
the
detective
came
near
replying
to
it
but
he
bethought
himself
and
said
nothing
that
settles
which
of
the
two
gnawed
the
loaf
continued
sweetwater
the
next
minute
he
was
hovering
over
the
still
more
pathetic
figure
of
john
sitting
in
the
chair
sad
sad
he
murmured
suddenly
he
laid
his
finger
on
a
small
rent
in
the
old
man
faded
vest
you
saw
this
of
course
said
he
with
a
quick
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
the
silent
detective
no
answer
as
before
it
a
new
slit
declared
the
officious
youth
looking
closer
and
yes
there
blood
on
its
edges
here
take
the
lantern
fenton
i
must
see
how
the
skin
looks
underneath
oh
gentlemen
no
shirt
the
poorest
dockhand
has
a
shirt
brocaded
vest
and
no
shirt
but
he
past
our
pity
now
ah
only
a
bruise
over
the
heart
sirs
what
did
you
make
out
of
this
as
none
of
them
had
even
seen
it
knapp
was
not
the
only
one
to
remain
silent
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
make
out
of
it
said
the
lad
rising
hurriedly
from
the
floor
which
he
had
as
hurriedly
examined
this
old
man
has
tried
to
take
his
life
with
the
dagger
already
wet
with
the
blood
of
agatha
webb
but
his
arm
was
too
feeble
the
point
only
pierced
the
vest
wiping
off
a
little
blood
in
its
passage
then
the
weapon
fell
from
his
hand
and
struck
the
floor
as
you
will
see
by
the
fresh
dent
in
the
old
board
i
am
standing
on
have
you
anything
to
say
against
these
simple
deductions
again
the
detective
opened
his
lips
and
might
have
spoken
but
sweetwater
gave
him
no
chance
where
is
the
letter
he
was
writing
he
demanded
have
any
of
you
seen
any
paper
lying
about
here
he
was
not
writing
objected
knapp
he
was
reading
reading
in
that
old
bible
you
see
there
sweetwater
caught
up
the
book
looked
it
over
and
laid
it
down
with
that
same
curious
twinkle
of
his
eye
they
had
noted
in
him
before
he
was
writing
he
insisted
see
here
is
his
pencil
and
he
showed
them
the
battered
end
of
a
small
lying
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
writing
at
some
time
admitted
knapp
writing
just
before
the
deed
insisted
sweetwater
look
at
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
they
have
not
moved
since
the
pencil
fell
out
of
them
the
letter
or
whatever
it
was
shall
be
looked
for
declared
the
constable
sweetwater
bowed
his
eyes
roving
restlessly
into
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
room
james
was
the
stronger
of
the
two
he
remarked
yet
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
made
any
attempt
at
suicide
how
do
you
know
that
it
was
suicide
john
attempted
asked
someone
why
might
not
the
dagger
have
fallen
from
james
hand
in
an
effort
to
kill
his
brother
because
the
dent
in
the
floor
would
have
been
to
the
right
of
the
chair
instead
of
to
the
left
he
returned
besides
james
hand
would
not
have
failed
so
utterly
since
he
had
strength
to
pick
up
the
weapon
afterward
and
lay
it
where
you
found
it
true
we
found
it
lying
on
the
table
observed
abel
scratching
his
head
in
forced
admiration
of
his
old
schoolmate
all
easy
very
easy
sweetwater
remarked
seeing
the
wonder
in
every
eye
matters
like
those
are
for
a
child
reading
but
what
is
difficult
and
what
i
find
hard
to
come
by
is
how
the
bill
got
into
the
old
man
hand
he
found
it
here
but
how
found
it
here
how
do
you
know
that
gentlemen
that
is
a
point
i
will
make
clear
to
you
later
when
i
have
laid
my
hand
on
a
certain
clew
i
am
anxiously
seeking
you
know
this
is
new
work
for
me
and
i
have
to
advance
warily
did
any
of
you
gentlemen
when
you
came
into
this
room
detect
the
faintest
odour
of
any
kind
of
perfume
perfume
echoed
abel
with
a
glance
about
the
musty
apartment
rats
rather
sweetwater
shook
his
head
with
a
discouraged
air
but
suddenly
brightened
and
stepping
quickly
across
the
floor
paused
at
one
of
the
windows
it
was
that
one
in
which
the
shade
had
been
drawn
peering
at
this
shade
he
gave
a
grunt
you
must
excuse
me
for
a
minute
said
he
i
have
not
found
what
i
wanted
in
this
room
and
now
must
look
outside
for
it
will
someone
bring
the
lantern
i
will
volunteered
knapp
with
grim
good
humour
indeed
the
situation
was
almost
ludicrous
to
him
bring
it
round
the
house
then
to
the
ground
under
this
window
ordered
sweetwater
without
giving
any
sign
that
he
noticed
or
even
recognised
the
other
air
of
condescension
and
gentlemen
please
do
follow
it
footsteps
i
am
after
and
the
fewer
we
make
ourselves
the
easier
will
it
be
for
me
to
establish
the
clew
i
am
after
fenton
stared
what
had
got
into
the
fellow
the
lantern
gone
the
room
resumed
its
former
appearance
abel
who
had
been
much
struck
by
sweetwater
mysterious
manoeuvres
drew
near
talbot
and
whispered
in
his
ear
we
might
have
done
without
that
fellow
from
boston
to
which
the
coroner
replied
perhaps
so
and
perhaps
not
sweetwater
has
not
yet
proved
his
case
let
us
wait
till
he
explains
himself
then
turning
to
the
constable
he
showed
him
an
miniature
which
he
had
found
lying
on
james
breast
when
he
made
his
first
examination
it
was
set
with
pearls
and
backed
with
gold
and
was
worth
many
meals
for
the
lack
of
which
its
devoted
owner
had
perished
agatha
webb
portrait
explained
talbot
or
rather
agatha
gilchrist
for
i
presume
this
was
painted
when
she
and
james
were
lovers
she
was
certainly
a
beauty
commented
fenton
as
he
bent
over
the
miniature
in
the
moonlight
i
do
not
wonder
she
queened
it
over
the
whole
country
he
must
have
worn
it
where
i
found
it
for
the
last
forty
years
mused
the
doctor
and
yet
men
say
that
love
is
a
fleeting
passion
well
after
coming
upon
this
proof
of
devotion
i
find
it
impossible
to
believe
james
zabel
accountable
for
the
death
of
one
so
fondly
remembered
sweetwater
instinct
was
truer
than
knapp
or
ours
muttered
fenton
gentlemen
interposed
abel
pointing
to
a
bright
spot
that
just
then
made
its
appearance
in
the
dark
outline
of
the
shade
before
alluded
to
do
you
see
that
hole
it
was
the
sight
of
that
prick
in
the
shade
which
sent
sweetwater
outside
looking
for
footprints
see
now
his
eye
is
to
it
as
the
bright
spot
became
suddenly
eclipsed
we
are
under
examination
sirs
and
the
next
thing
we
will
hear
is
that
he
not
the
only
person
who
been
peering
into
this
room
through
that
hole
he
was
so
far
right
that
the
first
words
of
sweetwater
on
his
were
it
all
sirs
i
have
found
my
missing
clew
james
zabel
was
not
the
only
person
who
came
up
here
from
the
webb
cottage
last
night
and
turning
to
knapp
who
was
losing
some
of
his
supercilious
manner
he
asked
with
significant
emphasis
if
of
the
full
amount
stolen
from
agatha
webb
you
found
twenty
dollars
in
the
possession
of
one
man
and
nine
hundred
and
eighty
dollars
in
the
possession
of
another
upon
which
of
the
two
would
you
fix
as
the
probable
murderer
of
the
good
woman
upon
him
who
held
the
lion
share
of
course
very
good
then
it
is
not
in
this
cottage
you
will
find
the
person
most
wanted
you
must
look
but
there
first
let
me
give
you
a
glimpse
of
the
money
is
there
anyone
here
ready
to
accompany
me
in
search
of
it
i
shall
have
to
take
him
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
you
have
seen
the
money
you
know
where
it
is
asked
talbot
and
fenton
in
one
breath
gentlemen
i
can
put
my
hand
on
it
in
ten
minutes
at
this
unexpected
and
somewhat
startling
statement
knapp
looked
at
talbot
and
talbot
looked
at
the
constable
but
only
the
last
spoke
that
is
saying
a
good
deal
but
no
matter
i
am
willing
to
credit
the
assertion
lead
on
sweetwater
i
go
with
you
sweetwater
seemed
to
grow
an
inch
taller
in
his
satisfied
vanity
and
dr
talbot
he
suggested
but
the
coroner
duty
held
him
to
the
house
and
he
decided
not
to
accompany
them
knapp
and
abel
however
yielded
to
the
curiosity
which
had
been
aroused
by
these
extraordinary
promises
and
presently
the
four
men
mentioned
started
on
their
small
expedition
up
the
hill
sweetwater
headed
the
procession
he
had
admonished
silence
and
his
wish
in
this
regard
was
so
well
carried
out
that
they
looked
more
like
a
group
of
spectres
moving
up
the
road
than
a
party
of
eager
and
impatient
men
not
till
they
turned
into
the
main
thoroughfare
did
anyone
speak
then
abel
could
no
longer
restrain
himself
and
he
cried
out
we
are
going
to
mr
sutherland
but
sweetwater
quickly
undeceived
him
no
said
he
only
into
the
woods
opposite
his
house
but
at
this
fenton
drew
him
back
are
you
sure
of
yourself
he
said
have
you
really
seen
this
money
and
is
it
concealed
in
this
forest
i
have
seen
the
money
sweetwater
solemnly
declared
and
it
is
hidden
in
these
woods
fenton
dropped
his
arm
and
they
moved
on
till
their
way
was
blocked
by
the
huge
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
it
is
here
we
are
to
look
cried
sweetwater
pausing
and
motioning
knapp
to
turn
his
lantern
on
the
spot
where
the
shadows
lay
thickest
now
what
do
you
see
he
asked
the
upturned
roots
of
a
great
tree
said
fenton
and
under
them
a
hole
or
rather
the
entrance
to
one
very
good
the
money
is
in
that
hole
pull
it
out
mr
fenton
the
assurance
with
which
sweetwater
spoke
was
such
that
fenton
at
once
stooped
and
plunged
his
hand
into
the
hole
but
when
after
a
hurried
search
he
drew
it
out
again
there
was
nothing
in
it
the
place
was
empty
sweetwater
stared
at
fenton
amazed
do
you
find
anything
he
asked
is
there
a
roll
of
bills
in
that
hole
no
was
the
gloomy
answer
after
a
renewed
attempt
and
a
second
disappointment
there
is
nothing
to
be
found
here
you
are
labouring
under
some
misapprehension
sweetwater
but
i
ca
be
i
saw
the
money
saw
it
in
the
hand
of
the
person
who
hid
it
there
let
me
look
for
it
constable
i
will
not
give
up
the
search
till
i
have
turned
the
place
kneeling
down
in
fenton
place
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
hole
on
either
side
of
him
peered
the
faces
of
fenton
and
knapp
abel
had
slipped
away
at
a
whisper
from
sweetwater
they
were
lit
with
a
similar
expression
of
anxious
interest
and
growing
doubt
his
own
countenance
was
a
study
of
conflicting
and
by
no
means
cheerful
emotions
suddenly
his
aspect
changed
with
a
quick
twist
of
his
lithe
if
awkward
body
he
threw
himself
lengthwise
on
the
ground
and
began
tearing
at
the
earth
inside
the
hole
like
a
burrowing
animal
i
can
not
be
mistaken
nothing
will
make
me
believe
it
is
not
here
it
has
simply
been
buried
deeper
than
i
thought
ah
what
did
i
tell
you
see
here
and
see
here
bringing
his
hands
into
the
full
blaze
of
the
light
he
showed
two
rolls
of
new
crisp
bills
they
were
lying
under
half
a
foot
of
earth
said
he
but
if
they
had
been
buried
as
deep
as
grannie
fuller
well
i
have
unearthed
them
meantime
fenton
was
rapidly
counting
one
roll
and
knapp
the
other
the
result
was
an
aggregate
sum
of
nine
hundred
and
eighty
dollars
just
the
amount
sweetwater
had
promised
to
show
them
a
good
stroke
of
business
cried
fenton
and
now
sweetwater
whose
is
the
hand
that
buried
this
treasure
nothing
is
to
be
gained
by
preserving
silence
on
this
point
any
longer
instantly
the
young
man
became
very
grave
with
a
quick
glance
around
which
seemed
to
embrace
the
secret
recesses
of
the
forest
rather
than
the
eager
faces
bending
towards
him
he
lowered
his
voice
and
quietly
said
the
hand
that
buried
this
money
under
the
roots
of
this
old
tree
is
the
same
which
you
saw
pointing
downward
at
the
spot
of
blood
in
agatha
webb
front
yard
you
do
not
mean
amabel
page
cried
fenton
with
natural
surprise
yes
i
do
and
i
am
glad
it
is
you
who
have
named
her
xvii
the
slippers
the
flower
and
what
sweetwater
made
of
them
a
later
these
men
were
all
closeted
with
talbot
in
the
zabel
kitchen
abel
had
rejoined
them
and
sweetwater
was
telling
his
story
with
great
earnestness
and
no
little
show
of
pride
gentlemen
when
i
charge
a
young
woman
of
respectable
appearance
and
connections
with
such
a
revolting
crime
as
murder
i
do
so
with
good
reason
as
i
hope
presently
to
make
plain
to
you
all
gentlemen
on
the
night
and
at
the
hour
agatha
webb
was
killed
i
was
playing
with
four
other
musicians
in
sutherland
hallway
from
the
place
where
i
sat
i
could
see
what
went
on
in
the
parlour
and
also
have
a
clear
view
of
the
passageway
leading
down
to
the
garden
door
as
the
dancing
was
going
on
in
the
parlour
i
naturally
looked
that
way
most
and
this
is
how
i
came
to
note
the
eagerness
with
which
during
the
first
part
of
the
evening
frederick
sutherland
and
amabel
page
came
together
in
the
quadrilles
and
country
dances
sometimes
she
spoke
as
she
passed
him
and
sometimes
he
answered
but
not
always
although
he
never
failed
to
show
he
was
pleased
with
her
or
would
have
been
if
something
perhaps
it
was
his
lack
of
confidence
in
her
sirs
had
not
stood
in
the
way
of
a
perfect
understanding
she
seemed
to
notice
that
he
did
not
always
respond
and
after
a
while
showed
less
inclination
to
speak
herself
though
she
did
not
fail
to
watch
him
and
that
intently
but
she
did
not
watch
him
any
more
closely
than
i
did
her
though
i
little
thought
at
the
time
what
would
come
of
my
espionage
she
wore
a
white
dress
and
white
shoes
and
was
as
coquettish
and
seductive
as
the
evil
one
makes
them
suddenly
i
missed
her
she
was
in
the
middle
of
the
dance
one
minute
and
entirely
out
of
it
the
next
naturally
i
supposed
her
to
have
slipped
aside
with
frederick
sutherland
but
he
was
still
in
sight
looking
so
pale
and
so
abstracted
however
i
was
sure
the
young
miss
was
up
to
some
sort
of
mischief
but
what
mischief
watching
and
waiting
but
no
longer
confining
my
attention
to
the
parlour
i
presently
espied
her
stealing
along
the
passageway
i
have
mentioned
carrying
a
long
cloak
which
she
rolled
up
and
hid
behind
the
open
door
then
she
came
back
humming
a
gay
little
song
which
did
deceive
me
for
a
moment
thought
i
and
that
cloak
will
soon
join
company
and
they
did
as
we
were
playing
the
harebell
mazurka
i
again
caught
sight
of
her
stealthy
white
figure
in
that
distant
doorway
seizing
the
cloak
she
wrapped
it
round
her
and
with
just
one
furtive
look
backwards
seen
i
warrant
by
no
one
but
myself
she
vanished
in
the
outside
dark
to
note
who
follows
her
but
nobody
followed
her
this
struck
me
as
strange
and
having
a
natural
love
for
detective
work
in
spite
of
my
devotion
to
the
arts
i
consulted
the
clock
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
noting
that
it
was
eleven
scribbled
the
hour
on
the
margin
of
my
music
with
the
intention
of
seeing
how
long
my
lady
would
linger
outside
alone
gentlemen
it
was
two
hours
before
i
saw
her
face
again
how
she
got
back
into
the
house
i
do
not
know
it
was
not
by
the
garden
door
for
my
eye
seldom
left
it
yet
at
or
near
one
i
heard
her
voice
on
the
stair
above
me
and
saw
her
descend
and
melt
into
the
crowd
as
if
she
had
not
been
absent
from
it
for
more
than
five
minutes
a
later
i
saw
her
with
frederick
again
they
were
dancing
but
not
with
the
same
spirit
as
before
and
even
while
i
watched
them
they
separated
now
where
was
miss
page
during
those
two
long
hours
i
think
i
know
and
it
is
time
i
unburdened
myself
to
the
police
but
first
i
must
inform
you
of
a
small
discovery
i
made
while
the
dance
was
still
in
progress
miss
page
had
descended
the
stairs
as
i
have
said
from
what
i
now
know
to
have
been
her
own
room
her
dress
was
in
all
respects
the
same
as
before
with
one
exception
her
white
slippers
had
been
exchanged
for
blue
ones
this
seemed
to
show
that
they
had
been
rendered
unserviceable
or
at
least
unsightly
by
the
walk
she
had
taken
this
in
itself
was
not
remarkable
nor
would
her
peculiar
escapade
have
made
more
than
a
temporary
impression
upon
my
curiosity
if
she
had
not
afterward
shown
in
my
presence
such
an
unaccountable
and
extraordinary
interest
in
the
murder
which
had
taken
place
in
the
town
below
during
the
very
hours
of
her
absence
from
sutherland
ball
this
in
consideration
of
her
sex
and
her
being
a
stranger
to
the
person
attacked
was
remarkable
and
though
perhaps
i
had
no
business
to
do
what
i
did
i
no
sooner
saw
the
house
emptied
of
master
and
servants
than
i
stole
softly
back
and
climbed
the
stairs
to
her
room
had
no
good
followed
this
intrusion
which
i
am
quite
ready
to
acknowledge
was
a
trifle
presumptuous
i
would
have
held
my
peace
in
regard
to
it
but
as
i
did
make
a
discovery
there
which
has
as
i
believe
an
important
bearing
on
this
affair
i
have
forced
myself
to
mention
it
the
lights
in
the
house
having
been
left
burning
i
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
her
apartment
i
knew
it
by
the
folderols
scattered
about
but
i
did
not
stop
to
look
at
them
i
was
on
a
search
for
her
slippers
and
presently
came
upon
them
thrust
behind
an
old
picture
in
the
dimmest
corner
of
the
room
taking
them
down
i
examined
them
closely
they
were
not
only
soiled
gentlemen
but
dreadfully
cut
and
rubbed
in
short
they
were
ruined
and
thinking
that
the
young
lady
herself
would
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
them
i
quietly
put
them
into
my
pocket
and
carried
them
to
my
own
home
abel
has
just
been
for
them
so
you
can
see
them
for
yourselves
and
if
your
judgment
coincides
with
mine
you
will
discover
something
more
on
them
than
mud
talbot
though
he
stared
a
little
at
the
young
man
confessed
theft
took
the
slippers
abel
was
holding
out
and
carefully
turned
them
over
they
were
as
sweetwater
had
said
grievously
torn
and
soiled
and
showed
beside
several
deep
a
mark
or
two
of
a
bright
red
colour
quite
unmistakable
in
its
character
blood
declared
the
coroner
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
miss
page
was
where
blood
was
spilled
last
night
i
have
another
proof
against
her
sweetwater
went
on
in
full
enjoyment
of
his
prominence
amongst
these
men
who
up
to
now
had
barely
recognised
his
existence
when
full
of
the
suspicion
that
miss
page
had
had
a
hand
in
the
theft
which
had
taken
place
at
house
if
not
in
the
murder
that
accompanied
it
i
hastened
down
to
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
i
met
this
young
woman
issuing
from
the
front
gate
she
had
just
been
making
herself
conspicuous
by
pointing
out
a
trail
of
blood
on
the
grass
plot
talbot
who
was
there
will
remember
how
she
looked
on
that
occasion
but
i
doubt
if
he
noticed
how
abel
here
looked
or
so
much
as
remarked
the
faded
flower
the
silly
boy
had
stuck
in
his
buttonhole
me
if
i
did
ejaculated
the
coroner
yet
that
flower
has
a
very
important
bearing
on
this
case
he
had
found
it
as
he
will
tell
you
on
the
floor
near
batsy
skirts
and
as
soon
as
i
saw
it
in
his
coat
i
bade
him
take
it
out
and
keep
it
for
gentlemen
it
was
a
very
uncommon
flower
the
like
of
which
can
only
be
found
in
this
town
in
sutherland
conservatory
i
remember
seeing
such
a
one
in
miss
page
hair
early
in
the
evening
have
you
that
flower
about
you
abel
abel
had
and
being
filled
with
importance
too
showed
it
to
the
doctor
and
to
fenton
it
was
withered
and
faded
in
hue
but
it
was
unmistakably
an
orchid
of
the
rarest
description
it
was
lying
near
batsy
explained
abel
i
drew
attention
to
it
at
the
time
but
he
scarcely
noticed
it
i
will
make
up
for
my
indifference
now
said
that
gentleman
i
should
have
been
shown
that
flower
put
in
knapp
so
you
should
acknowledged
sweetwater
but
when
the
detective
instinct
is
aroused
it
is
hard
for
a
man
to
be
just
to
his
rivals
besides
i
was
otherwise
occupied
i
had
miss
page
to
watch
happily
for
me
you
had
decided
that
she
should
not
be
allowed
to
leave
town
till
after
the
inquest
and
so
my
task
became
easy
this
whole
day
i
have
spent
in
sight
of
sutherland
house
and
at
nightfall
i
was
rewarded
by
detecting
her
end
a
prolonged
walk
in
the
garden
by
a
hurried
dash
into
the
woods
opposite
i
followed
her
and
noted
carefully
all
that
she
did
as
she
had
just
seen
frederick
sutherland
and
miss
halliday
disappear
up
the
road
together
she
probably
felt
free
to
do
as
she
liked
for
she
walked
very
directly
to
the
old
tree
we
have
just
come
from
and
kneeling
down
beside
it
pulled
from
the
hole
underneath
something
which
rattled
in
her
hand
with
that
peculiar
sound
we
associate
with
fresh
i
had
approached
her
as
near
as
i
dared
and
was
peering
around
a
tree
trunk
when
she
stooped
down
again
and
plunged
both
hands
into
the
hole
she
remained
in
this
position
so
long
that
i
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
but
she
rose
at
last
and
turned
toward
home
laughing
to
herself
in
a
wicked
but
pleased
way
that
did
not
tend
to
make
me
think
any
more
of
her
the
moon
was
shining
very
brightly
by
this
time
and
i
could
readily
perceive
every
detail
of
her
person
she
held
her
hands
out
before
her
and
shook
them
more
than
once
as
she
trod
by
me
so
i
was
sure
there
was
nothing
in
them
and
this
is
why
i
was
so
confident
we
should
find
the
money
still
in
the
hole
when
i
saw
her
enter
the
house
i
set
out
to
find
you
but
the
room
was
empty
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
learned
where
to
look
for
you
but
at
last
a
fellow
at
brighton
corner
said
he
saw
four
men
go
by
on
their
way
to
zabel
cottage
and
on
the
chance
of
finding
you
amongst
them
i
turned
down
here
the
shock
you
gave
me
in
announcing
that
you
had
discovered
the
murderer
of
agatha
webb
knocked
me
over
for
a
moment
but
now
i
hope
you
realise
as
i
do
that
this
wretched
man
could
never
have
had
an
active
hand
in
her
death
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
one
of
the
stolen
bills
has
been
found
in
his
possession
for
and
here
is
my
great
point
the
proof
is
not
wanting
that
miss
page
visited
this
house
as
well
as
webb
during
her
famous
escapade
or
at
least
stood
under
the
window
beneath
which
i
have
just
been
searching
a
footprint
can
be
seen
there
sirs
a
very
plain
footprint
and
if
talbot
will
take
the
trouble
to
compare
it
with
the
slipper
he
holds
in
his
hand
he
will
find
it
to
have
been
made
by
the
foot
that
wore
that
slipper
the
coroner
with
a
quick
glance
from
the
slipper
in
his
hand
up
to
sweetwater
eager
face
showed
a
decided
disposition
to
make
the
experiment
thus
suggested
but
fenton
whose
mind
was
full
of
the
zabel
tragedy
interrupted
them
with
the
question
but
how
do
you
explain
by
this
hypothesis
the
fact
of
james
zabel
trying
to
pass
one
of
the
bills
stolen
from
cupboard
do
you
consider
miss
page
generous
enough
to
give
him
that
money
you
ask
me
that
fenton
do
you
wish
to
know
what
think
of
the
connection
between
these
two
great
tragedies
yes
you
have
earned
a
voice
in
this
matter
speak
sweetwater
well
then
i
think
miss
page
has
made
an
effort
to
throw
the
blame
of
her
own
misdoing
on
one
or
both
of
these
unfortunate
old
men
she
is
sufficiently
and
calculating
to
do
so
and
circumstances
certainly
favoured
her
shall
i
show
how
fenton
consulted
knapp
who
nodded
his
head
the
boston
detective
was
not
without
curiosity
as
to
how
sweetwater
would
prove
the
case
old
james
zabel
had
seen
his
brother
sinking
rapidly
from
inanition
this
their
condition
amply
shows
he
was
weak
himself
but
john
was
weaker
and
in
a
moment
of
desperation
he
rushed
out
to
ask
a
crumb
of
bread
from
agatha
webb
or
possibly
for
i
have
heard
some
whispers
of
an
old
custom
of
theirs
to
join
philemon
at
his
yearly
and
so
obtain
in
a
natural
way
the
bite
for
himself
and
brother
he
perhaps
had
not
the
courage
to
ask
for
outright
but
death
had
been
in
the
webb
cottage
before
him
which
awful
circumstance
acting
on
his
already
weakened
nerves
drove
him
half
insane
from
the
house
and
sent
him
wandering
blindly
about
the
streets
for
a
good
before
he
reappeared
in
his
own
house
how
do
i
know
this
from
a
very
simple
fact
abel
here
has
been
to
inquire
among
other
things
if
crane
remembers
the
tune
we
were
playing
at
the
great
house
when
he
came
down
the
main
street
from
visiting
old
widow
walker
fortunately
he
does
for
the
trip
trip
trip
in
it
struck
his
fancy
and
he
has
found
himself
humming
it
over
more
than
once
since
well
that
waltz
was
played
by
us
at
a
quarter
after
midnight
which
fixes
the
time
of
the
encounter
at
webb
gateway
pretty
accurately
but
as
you
will
soon
see
it
was
ten
minutes
to
one
before
james
zabel
knocked
at
loton
door
how
do
i
know
this
by
the
same
method
of
reasoning
by
which
i
determined
the
time
of
crane
encounter
loton
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
music
played
that
night
and
had
all
her
windows
open
in
order
to
hear
it
and
she
says
we
were
playing
musk
when
that
knocking
came
to
disturb
her
now
gentlemen
we
played
musk
just
before
we
were
called
out
to
supper
and
as
we
went
to
supper
promptly
at
one
you
can
see
just
how
my
calculation
was
made
minutes
then
passed
between
the
moment
james
zabel
was
seen
rushing
from
webb
gateway
and
that
in
which
he
appeared
at
loton
bakery
demanding
a
loaf
of
bread
and
offering
in
exchange
one
of
the
bills
which
had
been
stolen
from
the
murdered
woman
drawer
minutes
and
he
and
his
brother
were
starving
does
it
look
then
as
if
that
money
was
in
his
possession
when
he
left
webb
house
would
any
man
who
felt
the
pangs
of
hunger
as
he
did
or
who
saw
a
brother
perishing
for
food
before
his
eyes
allow
minutes
to
elapse
before
he
made
use
of
the
money
that
rightfully
or
wrongfully
had
come
into
his
hand
no
and
so
i
say
that
he
did
not
have
it
when
crane
met
him
that
instead
of
committing
crime
to
obtain
it
he
found
it
in
his
own
home
lying
on
his
table
when
after
his
frenzied
absence
he
returned
to
tell
his
dreadful
news
to
the
brother
he
had
left
behind
him
but
how
did
it
come
there
you
ask
gentlemen
remember
the
footprints
under
the
window
amabel
page
brought
it
having
seen
or
perhaps
met
this
old
man
roaming
in
or
near
the
webb
cottage
during
the
time
she
was
there
herself
she
conceived
the
plan
of
throwing
upon
him
the
onus
of
the
crime
she
had
herself
committed
and
with
a
slyness
to
be
expected
from
one
so
crafty
stole
up
to
his
home
made
a
hole
in
the
shade
hanging
over
an
open
window
looked
into
the
room
where
john
sat
saw
that
he
was
there
alone
and
asleep
and
creeping
in
by
the
front
door
laid
on
the
table
beside
him
the
bill
and
the
bloody
dagger
with
which
she
had
just
slain
agatha
webb
then
she
stole
out
again
and
in
twenty
minutes
more
was
leading
the
dance
in
sutherland
parlour
well
reasoned
murmured
abel
expecting
the
others
to
echo
him
but
though
fenton
and
talbot
looked
almost
convinced
they
said
nothing
while
knapp
of
course
was
quiet
as
an
oyster
sweetwater
with
an
easy
smile
calculated
to
hide
his
disappointment
went
on
as
if
perfectly
satisfied
meanwhile
john
awakes
sees
the
dagger
and
thinks
to
end
his
misery
with
it
but
finds
himself
too
feeble
the
cut
in
his
vest
the
dent
in
the
floor
prove
this
but
if
you
call
for
further
proof
a
little
fact
which
some
if
not
all
of
you
seem
to
have
overlooked
will
amply
satisfy
you
that
this
one
at
least
of
my
conclusions
is
correct
open
the
bible
abel
open
it
not
to
shake
it
for
what
will
never
fall
from
between
its
leaves
but
to
find
in
the
bible
itself
the
lines
i
have
declared
to
you
he
wrote
as
a
dying
legacy
with
that
tightly
clutched
pencil
have
you
found
them
no
was
abel
perplexed
retort
i
can
not
see
any
sign
of
writing
on
flyleaf
or
margin
are
those
the
only
blank
places
in
the
sacred
book
search
the
leaves
devoted
to
the
family
record
now
what
do
you
find
there
knapp
who
was
losing
some
of
his
indifference
drew
nearer
and
read
for
himself
the
scrawl
which
now
appeared
to
every
eye
on
the
discoloured
page
which
abel
here
turned
uppermost
almost
illegible
he
said
one
can
just
make
out
these
words
me
james
tried
to
use
dagger
found
lying
but
hand
would
dying
without
do
grieve
true
men
have
disgraced
ourselves
god
bless
that
is
all
the
effort
must
have
overcome
him
resumed
sweetwater
in
a
voice
from
which
he
carefully
excluded
all
signs
of
secret
triumph
and
when
james
returned
as
he
did
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
evidently
unable
to
ask
questions
even
if
john
was
in
a
condition
to
answer
them
but
the
fallen
dagger
told
its
own
story
for
james
picked
it
up
and
put
it
back
on
the
table
and
it
was
at
this
minute
he
saw
what
john
had
not
the
bill
lying
there
with
its
promise
of
life
and
comfort
hope
revives
he
catches
up
the
bill
flies
down
to
loton
procures
a
loaf
of
bread
and
comes
frantically
back
gnawing
it
as
he
runs
for
his
own
hunger
is
more
than
he
can
endure
his
presence
he
rushes
forward
with
the
bread
but
the
relief
has
come
too
late
john
has
died
in
his
absence
and
james
dizzy
with
the
shock
reels
back
and
succumbs
to
his
own
misery
gentlemen
have
you
anything
to
say
in
contradiction
to
these
various
suppositions
for
a
moment
talbot
fenton
and
even
knapp
stood
silent
then
the
last
remarked
with
pardonable
dryness
all
this
is
ingenious
but
unfortunately
it
is
up
set
by
a
little
fact
which
you
yourself
have
overlooked
have
you
examined
attentively
the
dagger
of
which
you
have
so
often
spoken
mr
sweetwater
not
as
i
would
like
to
but
i
noticed
it
had
blood
on
its
edge
and
was
of
the
shape
and
size
necessary
to
inflict
the
wound
from
which
webb
died
very
good
but
there
is
something
else
of
interest
to
be
observed
on
it
fetch
it
abel
abel
hurrying
from
the
room
soon
brought
back
the
weapon
in
question
sweetwater
with
a
vague
sense
of
disappointment
disturbing
him
took
it
eagerly
and
studied
it
very
closely
but
he
only
shook
his
head
bring
it
nearer
to
the
light
suggested
knapp
and
examine
the
little
scroll
near
the
top
of
the
handle
sweetwater
did
so
and
at
once
changed
colour
in
the
midst
of
the
scroll
were
two
very
small
but
yet
perfectly
distinct
letters
they
were
j
z
how
did
amabel
page
come
by
a
dagger
marked
with
the
zabel
initials
questioned
knapp
do
you
think
her
foresight
went
so
far
as
to
provide
herself
with
a
dagger
ostensibly
belonging
to
one
of
these
brothers
and
then
have
you
forgotten
that
when
crane
met
the
old
man
at
webb
gateway
he
saw
in
his
hand
something
that
glistened
now
what
was
that
if
not
this
dagger
sweetwater
was
more
disturbed
than
he
cared
to
acknowledge
that
just
shows
my
lack
of
experience
he
grumbled
i
thought
i
had
turned
this
subject
so
thoroughly
over
in
my
mind
that
no
one
could
bring
an
objection
against
it
knapp
shook
his
head
and
smiled
young
enthusiasts
like
yourself
are
great
at
forming
theories
which
men
like
myself
must
regard
as
fantastical
however
he
went
on
there
is
no
doubt
that
miss
page
was
a
witness
to
even
if
she
has
not
profited
by
the
murder
we
have
been
considering
but
with
this
palpable
proof
of
the
direct
connection
with
the
affair
i
would
not
recommend
her
arrest
as
yet
she
should
be
under
surveillance
though
intimated
the
coroner
most
certainly
acquiesced
knapp
as
for
sweetwater
he
remained
silent
till
the
opportunity
came
for
him
to
whisper
apart
to
talbot
when
he
said
for
all
the
palpable
proof
of
which
knapp
speaks
the
j
on
the
dagger
and
the
possibility
of
this
being
the
object
he
was
seen
carrying
out
of
philemon
webb
gate
i
maintain
that
this
old
man
in
his
moribund
condition
never
struck
the
blow
that
killed
agatha
webb
he
had
strength
enough
even
if
his
lifelong
love
for
her
had
not
been
sufficient
to
prevent
him
the
coroner
looked
thoughtful
you
are
right
said
he
he
had
strength
enough
but
do
expend
too
much
energy
in
talk
wait
and
see
what
a
few
direct
questions
will
elicit
from
miss
page
xviii
some
leading
questions
frederick
rose
early
he
had
slept
but
little
the
words
he
had
overheard
at
the
end
of
the
lot
the
night
before
were
still
ringing
in
his
ears
going
down
the
back
stairs
in
his
anxiety
to
avoid
amabel
he
came
upon
one
of
the
stablemen
been
to
the
village
this
morning
he
asked
no
sir
but
lem
has
there
great
news
there
i
wonder
if
anyone
has
told
mr
sutherland
what
news
jake
i
do
think
my
father
is
up
yet
why
sir
there
were
two
more
deaths
in
town
last
night
the
brothers
zabel
and
folks
do
say
lem
heard
it
a
dozen
times
between
the
grocery
and
the
fish
market
that
it
was
one
of
these
old
men
who
killed
webb
the
dagger
has
been
found
in
their
house
and
most
of
the
money
why
sir
what
the
matter
are
you
sick
frederick
made
an
effort
and
stood
upright
he
had
nearly
fallen
no
that
is
i
am
not
quite
myself
so
many
horrors
jake
what
did
they
die
of
you
say
they
are
both
dead
both
yes
sir
and
it
dreadful
to
think
of
but
it
was
hunger
sir
bread
came
too
late
both
men
are
mere
skeletons
to
look
at
they
have
kept
themselves
close
for
weeks
now
and
nobody
knew
how
bad
off
they
were
i
do
wonder
it
upset
you
sir
we
all
feel
it
a
bit
and
i
just
dread
to
tell
mr
sutherland
frederick
staggered
away
he
had
never
in
his
life
been
so
near
mental
and
physical
collapse
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
he
met
his
father
sutherland
was
looking
both
troubled
and
anxious
more
so
frederick
thought
than
when
he
signed
the
check
for
him
on
the
previous
night
as
their
eyes
met
both
showed
embarrassment
but
frederick
whose
nerves
had
been
highly
strung
by
what
he
had
just
heard
soon
controlled
himself
and
surveying
his
father
with
forced
calmness
began
this
is
dreadful
news
sir
but
his
father
intent
on
his
own
thought
hurriedly
interrupted
him
you
told
me
yesterday
that
everything
was
broken
off
between
you
and
miss
page
yet
i
saw
you
reenter
the
house
together
last
night
a
little
while
after
i
gave
you
the
money
you
asked
for
i
know
and
it
must
have
had
a
bad
appearance
i
entreat
you
however
to
believe
that
this
meeting
between
miss
page
and
myself
was
against
my
wish
and
that
the
relations
between
us
have
not
been
affected
by
anything
that
passed
between
us
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
my
son
you
could
not
do
worse
by
yourself
than
to
return
to
your
old
devotion
i
agree
with
you
sir
and
then
because
he
could
not
help
it
frederick
inquired
if
he
had
heard
the
news
sutherland
evidently
startled
asked
what
news
to
which
frederick
replied
the
news
about
the
zabels
they
are
both
dead
sir
dead
from
hunger
can
you
imagine
it
this
was
something
so
different
from
what
his
father
had
expected
to
hear
that
he
did
not
take
it
in
at
first
when
he
did
his
surprise
and
grief
were
even
greater
than
frederick
had
anticipated
seeing
him
so
affected
frederick
who
thought
that
the
whole
truth
would
be
no
harder
to
bear
than
the
half
added
the
suspicion
which
had
been
attached
to
the
younger
one
name
and
then
stood
back
scarcely
daring
to
be
a
witness
to
the
outraged
feelings
which
such
a
communication
could
not
fail
to
awaken
in
one
of
his
father
temperament
but
though
he
thus
escaped
the
shocked
look
which
crossed
his
countenance
he
could
not
fail
to
hear
the
indignant
exclamation
which
burst
from
his
lips
nor
help
perceiving
that
it
would
take
more
than
the
most
complete
circumstantial
evidence
to
convince
his
father
of
the
guilt
of
men
he
had
known
and
respected
for
so
many
years
for
some
reason
frederick
experienced
great
relief
at
this
and
was
bracing
himself
to
meet
the
fire
of
questions
which
his
statement
must
necessarily
call
forth
when
the
sound
of
approaching
steps
drew
the
attention
of
both
towards
a
party
of
men
coming
up
the
hillside
among
them
was
courtney
prosecuting
attorney
for
the
district
and
as
sutherland
recognised
him
he
sprang
forward
saying
courtney
he
will
explain
this
frederick
followed
anxious
and
bewildered
and
soon
had
the
doubtful
pleasure
of
seeing
his
father
enter
his
study
in
company
with
the
four
men
considered
to
be
most
interested
in
the
elucidation
of
the
webb
mystery
as
he
was
lingering
in
an
undecided
mood
in
the
small
passageway
leading
he
felt
the
pressure
of
a
finger
on
his
shoulder
looking
up
he
met
the
eyes
of
amabel
who
was
leaning
toward
him
over
the
banisters
she
was
smiling
and
though
her
face
was
not
without
evidences
of
physical
languor
there
was
a
charm
about
her
person
which
would
have
been
sufficiently
enthralling
to
him
hours
before
but
which
now
caused
him
such
a
physical
repulsion
that
he
started
back
in
the
effort
to
rid
his
shoulder
from
her
disturbing
touch
she
frowned
it
was
an
instantaneous
expression
of
displeasure
which
was
soon
lost
in
one
of
her
gurgling
laughs
is
my
touch
so
burdensome
she
demanded
if
the
pressure
of
one
finger
is
so
unbearable
to
your
sensitive
nerves
how
will
you
relish
the
weight
of
my
whole
hand
there
was
a
fierceness
in
her
tone
a
purpose
in
her
look
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
struggle
with
her
revealed
the
full
depth
of
her
dark
nature
shrinking
from
her
appalled
he
put
up
his
hand
in
protest
at
which
she
changed
again
in
a
twinkling
and
with
a
cautious
gesture
toward
the
room
into
which
sutherland
and
his
friends
had
disappeared
she
whispered
significantly
we
may
not
have
another
chance
to
confer
together
understand
then
that
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
you
to
tell
me
in
so
many
words
that
you
are
ready
to
link
your
fortunes
to
mine
the
taking
off
of
the
ring
you
wear
and
your
slow
putting
of
it
on
again
in
my
presence
will
be
understood
by
me
as
a
token
that
you
have
reconsidered
your
present
attitude
and
desire
my
silence
and
myself
frederick
could
not
repress
a
shudder
for
an
instant
he
was
tempted
to
succumb
on
the
spot
and
have
the
long
agony
over
then
his
horror
of
the
woman
rose
to
such
a
pitch
that
he
uttered
an
execration
and
turning
away
from
her
face
which
was
rapidly
growing
loathsome
to
him
he
ran
out
of
the
passageway
into
the
garden
seeing
as
he
ran
a
persistent
vision
of
himself
pulling
off
the
ring
and
putting
it
back
again
under
the
spell
of
a
look
he
rebelled
against
even
while
he
yielded
to
its
influence
i
will
not
wear
a
ring
i
will
not
subject
myself
to
the
possibility
of
obeying
her
behest
under
a
sudden
stress
of
fear
or
fascination
he
exclaimed
pausing
by
the
and
looking
over
it
at
his
reflection
in
the
water
beneath
if
i
drop
it
here
i
at
least
lose
the
horror
of
doing
what
she
suggests
under
some
involuntary
impulse
but
the
thought
that
the
mere
absence
of
the
ring
from
his
finger
would
not
stand
in
the
way
of
his
going
through
the
motions
to
which
she
had
just
given
such
significance
deterred
him
from
the
sacrifice
of
a
valuable
family
jewel
and
he
left
the
spot
with
an
air
of
frenzy
such
as
a
man
displays
when
he
feels
himself
on
the
verge
of
a
doom
he
can
neither
meet
nor
avert
as
he
the
house
he
felt
himself
enveloped
in
the
atmosphere
of
a
coming
crisis
he
could
hear
voices
in
the
upper
hall
and
amongst
them
he
caught
the
accents
of
her
he
had
learned
so
lately
to
fear
impelled
by
something
deeper
than
curiosity
and
more
potent
even
than
dread
he
hastened
toward
the
stairs
when
up
he
caught
sight
of
amabel
she
was
leaning
back
against
the
balustrade
that
ran
across
the
upper
hall
with
her
hands
gripping
the
rail
on
either
side
of
her
and
her
face
turned
toward
the
five
men
who
had
evidently
issued
from
sutherland
study
to
interview
her
as
her
back
was
to
frederick
he
could
not
judge
of
the
expression
of
that
face
save
by
the
effect
it
had
upon
the
different
men
confronting
her
but
to
see
them
was
enough
from
their
looks
he
could
perceive
that
this
young
girl
was
in
one
of
her
baffling
moods
and
that
from
his
father
down
not
one
of
the
men
present
knew
what
to
make
of
her
at
the
sound
his
feet
made
a
relaxation
took
place
in
her
body
and
she
lost
something
of
the
defiant
attitude
she
had
before
maintained
presently
he
heard
her
voice
i
am
willing
to
answer
any
questions
you
may
choose
to
put
to
me
here
but
i
can
not
consent
to
shut
myself
in
with
you
in
that
small
study
i
should
suffocate
frederick
could
perceive
the
looks
which
passed
between
the
five
men
assembled
before
her
and
was
astonished
to
note
that
the
insignificant
fellow
they
called
sweetwater
was
the
first
to
answer
very
well
said
he
if
you
enjoy
the
publicity
of
the
open
hall
no
one
here
will
object
is
not
that
so
gentlemen
her
two
little
fingers
which
were
turned
towards
frederick
ran
up
and
down
the
rail
making
a
peculiar
rasping
noise
which
for
a
moment
was
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
then
courtney
said
how
came
you
to
have
the
handling
of
the
money
taken
from
agatha
private
drawer
it
was
a
startling
question
but
it
seemed
to
affect
amabel
less
than
it
did
frederick
it
made
him
start
but
she
only
turned
her
head
a
trifle
aside
so
that
the
peculiar
smile
with
which
she
prepared
to
answer
could
be
seen
by
anyone
standing
below
suppose
you
ask
something
less
leading
than
that
to
begin
with
she
suggested
in
her
high
unmusical
voice
from
the
searching
nature
of
this
inquiry
you
evidently
believe
i
have
information
of
an
important
character
to
give
you
concerning
webb
unhappy
death
ask
me
about
that
the
other
question
i
will
answer
later
the
aplomb
with
which
this
was
said
mixed
as
it
was
with
a
feminine
allurement
of
more
than
ordinary
subtlety
made
sutherland
frown
and
talbot
look
perplexed
but
it
did
not
embarrass
courtney
who
made
haste
to
respond
in
his
dryest
accents
very
well
i
am
not
particular
as
to
what
you
answer
first
a
flower
worn
by
you
at
the
dance
was
found
near
batsy
skirts
before
she
was
lifted
up
that
morning
can
you
explain
this
or
rather
will
you
you
are
not
obliged
to
you
know
put
in
sutherland
with
his
inexorable
sense
of
justice
still
if
you
would
it
might
rob
these
gentlemen
of
suspicions
you
certainly
can
not
wish
them
to
entertain
what
i
say
she
remarked
slowly
will
be
as
true
to
the
facts
as
if
i
stood
here
on
my
oath
i
can
explain
how
a
flower
from
my
hair
came
to
be
in
webb
house
but
not
how
it
came
to
be
found
under
feet
that
someone
else
must
clear
up
her
little
finger
lifted
from
the
rail
pointed
toward
frederick
but
no
one
saw
this
unless
it
was
that
gentleman
himself
i
wore
a
purple
orchid
in
my
hair
that
night
and
there
would
be
nothing
strange
in
its
being
afterward
picked
up
in
webb
house
because
i
was
in
that
house
at
or
near
the
time
she
was
murdered
you
in
that
house
yes
as
far
as
the
ground
floor
no
farther
here
the
little
finger
stopped
pointing
i
am
ready
to
tell
you
about
it
sirs
and
only
regret
i
have
delayed
doing
so
so
long
but
i
wished
to
be
sure
it
was
necessary
your
presence
here
and
your
first
question
show
that
it
is
there
was
suavity
in
her
tone
now
not
unmixed
with
candour
sweetwater
did
not
seem
to
relish
this
for
he
moved
uneasily
and
lost
a
shade
of
his
attitude
he
had
still
to
be
made
acquainted
with
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
this
woman
remarkable
nature
we
are
waiting
suggested
talbot
she
turned
to
face
this
new
speaker
and
frederick
was
relieved
from
the
sight
of
her
tantalising
smile
i
will
tell
my
story
simply
said
she
with
the
simple
suggestion
that
you
believe
me
otherwise
you
will
make
a
mistake
while
i
was
resting
from
a
dance
the
other
night
i
heard
two
of
the
young
people
talking
about
the
zabels
one
of
them
was
laughing
at
the
old
men
and
the
other
was
trying
to
relate
some
story
of
early
love
which
had
been
the
cause
she
thought
of
their
strange
and
melancholy
lives
i
was
listening
to
them
but
i
did
not
take
in
much
of
what
they
were
saying
till
i
heard
behind
me
an
irascible
voice
exclaiming
laugh
do
you
i
wonder
if
you
would
laugh
so
easily
if
you
knew
that
these
two
poor
old
men
have
had
a
decent
meal
in
a
fortnight
i
did
know
the
speaker
but
i
was
thrilled
by
his
words
not
had
a
good
meal
these
men
for
a
fortnight
i
felt
as
if
personally
guilty
of
their
suffering
and
happening
to
raise
my
eyes
at
this
minute
and
seeing
through
an
open
door
the
bountiful
refreshments
prepared
for
us
in
the
supper
room
i
felt
guiltier
than
ever
suddenly
i
took
a
resolution
it
was
a
queer
one
and
may
serve
to
show
you
some
of
the
oddities
of
my
nature
though
i
was
engaged
for
the
next
dance
and
though
i
was
dressed
in
the
flimsy
garments
suitable
to
the
occasion
i
decided
to
leave
the
ball
and
carry
some
sandwiches
down
to
these
old
men
procuring
a
bit
of
paper
i
made
up
a
bundle
and
stole
out
of
the
house
without
having
said
a
word
to
anybody
of
my
intention
not
wishing
to
be
seen
i
went
out
by
the
garden
door
which
is
at
the
end
of
the
dark
hall
just
as
the
band
was
playing
the
harebell
mazurka
interpolated
sweetwater
startled
for
the
first
time
from
her
careless
composure
by
an
interruption
of
which
it
was
impossible
for
her
at
that
time
to
measure
either
the
motive
or
the
meaning
she
ceased
to
play
with
her
fingers
on
the
baluster
rail
and
let
her
eyes
rest
for
a
moment
on
the
man
who
had
thus
spoken
as
if
she
hesitated
between
her
desire
to
annihilate
him
for
his
impertinence
and
a
fear
of
the
cold
hate
she
saw
actuating
his
every
word
and
look
then
she
went
on
as
if
no
one
had
spoken
i
ran
down
the
hill
recklessly
i
was
bent
on
my
errand
and
not
at
all
afraid
of
the
dark
when
i
reached
that
part
of
the
road
where
the
streets
branch
off
i
heard
footsteps
in
front
of
me
i
had
overtaken
someone
slackening
my
pace
so
that
i
should
not
pass
this
person
whom
i
instinctively
knew
to
be
a
man
i
followed
him
till
i
came
to
a
high
board
fence
it
was
that
surrounding
agatha
webb
house
and
when
i
saw
it
i
could
not
help
connecting
the
rather
stealthy
gait
of
the
man
in
front
of
me
with
a
story
i
had
lately
heard
of
the
large
sum
of
money
she
was
known
to
keep
in
her
house
whether
this
was
before
or
after
this
person
disappeared
round
the
corner
i
can
not
say
but
no
sooner
had
i
become
certain
that
he
was
bent
upon
entering
this
house
than
my
impulse
to
follow
him
became
greater
than
my
precaution
and
turning
aside
from
the
direct
path
to
the
zabels
i
hurried
down
high
street
just
in
time
to
see
the
man
enter
webb
front
gateway
it
was
a
late
hour
for
visiting
but
as
the
house
had
lights
in
both
its
lower
and
upper
stories
i
should
by
good
rights
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
he
was
an
expected
guest
and
gone
on
my
way
to
the
zabels
but
i
did
not
the
softness
with
which
this
person
stepped
and
the
skulking
way
in
which
he
hesitated
at
the
front
gate
aroused
my
worst
fears
and
after
he
had
opened
that
gate
and
slid
in
i
was
so
pursued
by
the
idea
that
he
was
there
for
no
good
that
i
stepped
inside
the
gate
myself
and
took
my
stand
in
the
deep
shadow
cast
by
the
old
pear
tree
on
the
side
of
the
walk
did
anyone
speak
there
was
a
unanimous
denial
from
the
five
gentlemen
before
her
yet
she
did
not
look
satisfied
i
thought
i
heard
someone
make
a
remark
she
repeated
and
paused
again
for
a
during
which
her
smile
was
a
study
it
was
so
cold
and
in
such
startling
contrast
to
the
vivid
glances
she
threw
everywhere
except
behind
her
on
the
landing
where
frederick
stood
listening
to
her
every
word
we
are
very
much
interested
remarked
courtney
pray
go
on
drawing
her
left
hand
from
the
balustrade
where
it
had
rested
she
looked
at
one
of
her
fingers
with
an
odd
backward
gesture
i
will
she
said
and
her
tone
was
hard
and
threatening
five
minutes
no
longer
passed
when
i
was
startled
by
a
loud
and
terrible
cry
from
the
house
and
looking
up
at
the
window
from
which
the
sound
proceeded
i
saw
a
woman
figure
hanging
out
in
a
seemingly
pulseless
condition
too
terrified
to
move
i
clung
trembling
to
the
tree
hearing
and
not
hearing
the
shouts
and
laughter
of
a
dozen
or
more
men
who
at
that
minute
passed
by
the
corner
on
their
way
to
the
wharves
i
was
dazed
i
was
choking
and
only
came
to
myself
when
sooner
or
later
i
do
not
know
how
soon
or
how
late
a
fresh
horror
happened
the
woman
whom
i
had
just
seen
fall
almost
from
the
window
was
a
serving
woman
but
when
i
heard
another
scream
i
knew
that
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
being
attacked
and
rivetting
my
eyes
on
those
windows
i
beheld
the
shade
of
one
of
them
thrown
back
and
a
hand
appear
flinging
out
something
which
fell
in
the
grass
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lawn
then
the
shade
fell
again
and
hearing
nothing
further
i
ran
to
where
the
object
flung
out
had
fallen
and
feeling
for
it
found
and
picked
up
an
dagger
dripping
with
blood
horrified
beyond
all
expression
i
dropped
the
weapon
and
retreated
into
my
former
place
of
concealment
but
i
was
not
satisfied
to
remain
there
a
curiosity
a
determination
even
to
see
the
man
who
had
committed
this
dastardly
deed
attacked
me
with
such
force
that
i
was
induced
to
leave
my
and
even
to
enter
the
house
where
in
all
probability
he
was
counting
the
gains
he
had
just
obtained
at
the
price
of
so
much
precious
blood
the
door
which
he
had
not
perfectly
closed
behind
him
seemed
to
invite
me
in
and
before
i
had
realised
my
own
temerity
i
was
standing
in
the
hall
of
this
house
the
interest
which
up
to
this
moment
had
been
breathless
now
expressed
itself
in
hurried
ejaculations
and
broken
words
and
sutherland
who
had
listened
like
one
in
a
dream
exclaimed
eagerly
and
in
a
tone
which
proved
that
he
for
the
moment
at
least
believed
this
more
than
improbable
tale
then
you
can
tell
us
if
philemon
was
in
the
little
room
at
the
moment
when
you
entered
the
house
as
everyone
there
present
realised
the
importance
of
this
question
a
general
movement
took
place
and
each
and
all
drew
nearer
as
she
met
their
eyes
and
answered
placidly
yes
webb
was
sitting
in
a
chair
asleep
he
was
the
only
person
i
saw
oh
i
know
he
never
committed
this
crime
gasped
his
old
friend
in
a
relief
so
great
that
one
and
all
seemed
to
share
it
now
i
have
courage
for
the
rest
go
on
miss
page
but
miss
page
paused
again
to
look
at
her
finger
and
give
that
sideways
toss
to
her
head
that
seemed
so
uncalled
for
by
the
situation
to
any
who
did
not
know
of
the
compact
between
herself
and
the
listening
man
below
i
hate
to
go
back
to
that
moment
said
she
for
when
i
saw
the
candles
burning
on
the
table
and
the
husband
of
the
woman
who
at
that
very
instant
was
possibly
breathing
her
last
breath
in
the
room
overhead
sitting
there
in
unconscious
apathy
i
felt
something
rise
in
my
throat
that
made
me
deathly
sick
for
a
moment
then
i
went
right
in
where
he
was
and
was
about
to
shake
his
arm
and
wake
him
when
i
detected
a
spot
of
blood
on
my
finger
from
the
dagger
i
had
handled
that
gave
me
another
turn
and
led
me
to
wipe
off
my
finger
on
his
sleeve
it
a
pity
you
did
not
wipe
off
your
slippers
too
murmured
sweetwater
again
she
looked
at
him
again
her
eyes
opened
in
terror
upon
the
face
of
this
man
once
so
plain
and
insignificant
in
her
eyes
but
now
so
filled
with
menace
she
inwardly
quaked
before
it
for
all
her
apparent
scorn
slippers
she
murmured
did
not
your
feet
as
well
as
your
hands
pass
through
the
blood
on
the
grass
she
disdained
to
answer
him
i
have
accounted
for
the
blood
on
my
hand
she
said
not
looking
at
him
but
at
courtney
if
there
is
any
on
my
slippers
it
can
be
accounted
for
in
the
same
way
and
she
rapidly
resumed
her
narrative
i
had
no
sooner
made
my
little
finger
clean
i
never
thought
of
anyone
suspecting
the
old
gentleman
when
i
heard
steps
on
the
stairs
and
knew
that
the
murderer
was
coming
down
and
in
another
instant
would
pass
the
open
door
before
which
i
stood
though
i
had
been
courageous
enough
up
to
that
minute
i
was
seized
by
a
sudden
panic
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
face
to
face
one
whose
hands
were
perhaps
dripping
with
the
blood
of
his
victim
to
confront
him
there
and
then
might
mean
death
to
me
and
i
did
not
want
to
die
but
to
live
for
i
am
young
sirs
and
not
without
a
prospect
of
happiness
before
me
so
i
sprang
back
and
seeing
no
other
place
of
concealment
in
the
whole
bare
room
crouched
down
in
the
shadow
of
the
man
you
call
philemon
for
one
two
minutes
i
knelt
there
in
a
state
of
mortal
terror
while
the
feet
descended
paused
started
to
enter
the
room
where
i
was
hesitated
turned
and
finally
left
the
house
miss
page
wait
wait
put
in
the
coroner
you
saw
him
you
can
tell
who
this
man
was
the
eagerness
of
this
appeal
seemed
to
excite
her
a
slight
colour
appeared
in
her
cheeks
and
she
took
a
step
forward
but
before
the
words
for
which
they
so
anxiously
waited
could
leave
her
lips
she
gave
a
start
and
drew
back
with
an
ejaculation
which
left
a
more
or
less
sinister
echo
in
the
ears
of
all
who
heard
it
frederick
had
just
shown
himself
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
gentlemen
said
he
advancing
into
their
midst
with
an
air
whose
unexpected
manliness
disguised
his
inward
agitation
the
few
words
i
have
just
heard
miss
page
say
interest
me
so
much
i
find
it
impossible
not
to
join
you
amabel
upon
whose
lips
a
faint
complacent
smile
had
appeared
as
he
stepped
by
her
glanced
up
at
these
words
in
secret
astonishment
at
the
indifference
they
showed
and
then
dropped
her
eyes
to
his
hands
with
an
intent
gaze
which
seemed
to
affect
him
unpleasantly
for
he
thrust
them
immediately
behind
him
though
he
did
not
lower
his
head
or
lose
his
air
of
determination
is
my
presence
here
undesirable
he
inquired
with
a
glance
towards
his
father
sweetwater
looked
as
if
he
thought
it
was
but
he
did
not
presume
to
say
anything
and
the
others
being
too
interested
in
the
developments
of
miss
page
story
to
waste
any
time
on
lesser
matters
frederick
remained
greatly
to
miss
page
evident
satisfaction
did
you
see
this
man
face
courtney
now
broke
in
in
urgent
inquiry
her
answer
came
slowly
after
another
long
look
in
direction
no
i
did
not
dare
to
make
the
effort
i
was
obliged
to
crouch
too
close
to
the
floor
i
simply
heard
his
footsteps
see
now
muttered
sweetwater
but
in
so
low
a
tone
she
did
not
hear
him
she
condemns
herself
there
is
a
woman
living
who
would
fail
to
look
up
under
such
circumstances
even
at
the
risk
of
her
life
knapp
seemed
to
agree
with
him
but
courtney
following
his
one
idea
pressed
his
former
question
saying
was
it
an
old
man
step
it
was
not
an
agile
one
and
you
did
not
catch
the
least
glimpse
of
the
man
face
or
figure
not
a
glimpse
so
you
are
in
no
position
to
identify
him
if
by
any
chance
i
should
hear
those
same
footsteps
coming
down
a
flight
of
stairs
i
think
i
should
be
able
to
recognise
them
she
allowed
in
the
sweetest
tones
at
her
command
she
knows
it
is
too
late
for
her
to
hear
those
of
the
two
dead
zabels
growled
the
man
from
boston
we
are
no
nearer
the
solution
of
this
mystery
than
we
were
in
the
beginning
remarked
the
coroner
gentlemen
i
have
not
yet
finished
my
story
intimated
amabel
sweetly
perhaps
what
i
have
yet
to
tell
may
give
you
some
clew
to
the
identity
of
this
man
ah
yes
go
on
go
on
you
have
not
yet
explained
how
you
came
to
be
in
possession
of
agatha
money
just
so
she
answered
with
another
quick
look
at
frederick
the
last
she
gave
him
for
some
time
as
soon
then
as
i
dared
i
ran
out
of
the
house
into
the
yard
the
moon
which
had
been
under
a
cloud
was
now
shining
brightly
and
by
its
light
i
saw
that
the
space
before
me
was
empty
and
that
i
might
venture
to
enter
the
street
but
before
doing
so
i
looked
about
for
the
dagger
i
had
thrown
from
me
before
going
in
but
i
could
not
find
it
it
had
been
picked
up
by
the
fugitive
and
carried
away
annoyed
at
the
cowardice
which
had
led
me
to
lose
such
a
valuable
piece
of
evidence
through
a
purely
womanish
emotion
i
was
about
to
leave
the
yard
when
my
eyes
fell
on
the
little
bundle
of
sandwiches
which
i
had
brought
down
from
the
hill
and
which
i
had
let
fall
under
the
pear
tree
at
the
first
scream
i
had
heard
from
the
house
it
had
burst
open
and
two
or
three
of
the
sandwiches
lay
broken
on
the
ground
but
those
that
were
intact
i
picked
up
and
being
more
than
ever
anxious
to
cover
up
by
some
ostensible
errand
my
absence
from
the
party
i
rushed
away
toward
the
lonely
road
where
these
brothers
lived
meaning
to
leave
such
fragments
as
remained
on
the
old
doorstep
beyond
which
i
had
been
told
such
suffering
existed
it
was
now
late
very
late
for
a
girl
like
myself
to
be
out
but
under
the
excitement
of
what
i
had
just
seen
and
heard
i
became
oblivious
to
fear
and
rushed
into
those
dismal
shadows
as
into
transparent
daylight
perhaps
the
shouts
and
stray
sounds
of
laughter
that
came
up
from
the
wharves
where
a
ship
was
getting
under
way
gave
me
a
certain
sense
of
companionship
perhaps
but
it
is
folly
for
me
to
dilate
upon
my
feelings
it
is
my
errand
you
are
interested
in
and
what
happened
when
i
approached
the
zabels
dreary
dwelling
the
look
with
which
she
paused
ostensibly
to
take
breath
but
in
reality
to
weigh
and
criticise
the
looks
of
those
about
her
was
one
of
those
wholly
indescribable
ones
with
which
she
was
accustomed
to
control
the
judgment
of
men
who
allowed
themselves
to
watch
too
closely
the
expression
of
her
weird
yet
charming
face
but
it
fell
upon
men
steeled
against
her
fascinations
and
realising
her
inability
to
move
them
she
proceeded
with
her
story
before
even
the
most
anxious
of
her
hearers
could
request
her
to
do
so
i
had
come
along
the
road
very
quietly
said
she
for
my
feet
were
lightly
shod
and
the
moonlight
was
too
bright
for
me
to
make
a
misstep
but
as
i
cleared
the
trees
and
came
into
the
open
place
where
the
house
stands
i
stumbled
with
surprise
at
seeing
a
figure
crouching
on
the
doorstep
i
had
anticipated
finding
as
empty
as
the
road
it
was
an
old
man
figure
and
as
i
paused
in
my
embarrassment
he
slowly
and
with
great
feebleness
rose
to
his
feet
and
began
to
grope
about
for
the
door
as
he
did
so
i
heard
a
sharp
tinkling
sound
as
of
something
metallic
falling
on
the
doorstone
and
taking
a
quick
step
forward
i
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
espied
in
the
moonlight
at
his
feet
a
dagger
so
like
the
one
i
had
lately
handled
in
webb
yard
that
i
was
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
and
surveyed
the
aged
and
feeble
form
of
the
man
who
had
dropped
it
with
a
sensation
difficult
to
describe
the
next
moment
he
was
stooping
for
the
weapon
with
a
startled
air
that
has
impressed
itself
distinctly
upon
my
memory
and
when
after
many
feeble
attempts
he
succeeded
in
grasping
it
he
vanished
into
the
house
so
suddenly
that
i
could
not
be
sure
whether
or
not
he
had
seen
me
standing
there
all
this
was
more
than
surprising
to
me
for
i
had
never
thought
of
associating
an
old
man
with
this
crime
indeed
i
was
so
astonished
to
find
him
in
possession
of
this
weapon
that
i
forgot
all
about
my
errand
and
only
wondered
how
i
could
see
and
know
more
fearing
detection
i
slid
in
amongst
the
bushes
and
soon
found
myself
under
one
of
the
windows
the
shade
was
down
and
i
was
about
to
push
it
aside
when
i
heard
someone
moving
about
inside
and
stopped
but
i
could
not
restrain
my
curiosity
so
pulling
a
hairpin
from
my
hair
i
worked
a
little
hole
in
the
shade
and
through
this
i
looked
into
a
room
brightly
illumined
by
the
moon
which
shone
in
through
an
adjoining
window
and
what
did
i
see
there
her
eye
turned
on
frederick
his
right
hand
had
stolen
toward
his
left
but
it
paused
under
her
look
and
remained
motionless
only
an
old
man
sitting
at
a
table
and
why
did
she
pause
and
why
did
she
cover
up
that
pause
with
a
wholly
inconsequential
sentence
perhaps
frederick
could
have
told
frederick
whose
hand
had
now
fallen
at
his
side
but
frederick
volunteered
nothing
and
no
one
not
even
sweetwater
guessed
all
that
lay
beyond
that
and
which
was
left
hovering
in
the
air
to
be
finished
when
alas
had
she
not
set
the
day
and
the
hour
what
she
did
say
was
in
seeming
explanation
of
her
previous
sentence
it
was
not
the
same
old
man
i
had
seen
on
the
doorstep
and
while
i
was
looking
at
him
i
became
aware
of
someone
leaving
the
house
and
passing
me
on
the
road
of
course
this
ended
my
interest
in
what
went
on
within
and
turning
as
quickly
as
i
could
i
hurried
into
the
road
and
followed
the
shadow
i
could
just
perceive
disappearing
in
the
woods
above
me
i
was
bound
gentlemen
as
you
see
to
follow
out
my
adventure
to
the
end
but
my
task
now
became
very
difficult
for
the
moon
was
high
and
shone
down
upon
the
road
so
distinctly
that
i
could
not
follow
the
person
before
me
as
closely
as
i
wished
without
running
the
risk
of
being
discovered
by
him
i
therefore
trusted
more
to
my
ear
than
to
my
eye
and
as
long
as
i
could
hear
his
steps
in
front
of
me
i
was
satisfied
but
presently
as
we
turned
up
this
very
hill
i
ceased
to
hear
these
steps
and
so
became
confident
that
he
had
taken
to
the
woods
i
was
so
sure
of
this
that
i
did
not
hesitate
to
enter
them
myself
and
knowing
the
paths
well
as
i
have
every
opportunity
of
doing
living
as
we
do
directly
opposite
this
forest
i
easily
found
my
way
to
the
little
clearing
that
i
have
reason
to
think
you
gentlemen
have
since
become
acquainted
with
but
though
from
the
sounds
i
heard
i
was
assured
that
the
person
i
was
following
was
not
far
in
advance
of
me
i
did
not
dare
to
enter
this
brilliantly
illumined
space
especially
as
there
was
every
indication
of
this
person
having
completed
whatever
task
he
had
set
for
himself
indeed
i
was
sure
that
i
heard
his
steps
coming
back
so
for
the
second
time
i
crouched
down
in
the
darkest
place
i
could
find
and
let
this
mysterious
person
pass
me
when
he
had
quite
disappeared
i
made
my
own
retreat
for
it
was
late
and
i
was
afraid
of
being
missed
at
the
ball
but
later
or
rather
the
next
day
i
recrossed
the
road
and
began
a
search
for
the
money
which
i
was
confident
had
been
left
in
the
woods
opposite
by
the
person
i
had
been
following
i
found
it
and
when
the
man
here
present
who
though
a
mere
fiddler
has
presumed
to
take
a
leading
part
in
this
interview
came
upon
me
with
the
bills
in
my
hand
i
was
but
burying
deeper
the
gains
i
had
come
upon
ah
and
so
making
them
your
own
quoth
sweetwater
stung
by
the
sarcasm
in
that
word
fiddler
but
with
a
suavity
against
which
every
attack
fell
powerless
she
met
his
significant
look
with
one
fully
as
significant
and
quietly
said
if
i
had
wanted
the
money
for
myself
i
would
not
have
risked
leaving
it
where
the
murderer
could
find
it
by
digging
up
a
few
handfuls
of
mould
and
a
bunch
of
sodden
leaves
no
i
had
another
motive
for
my
action
a
motive
with
which
few
if
any
of
you
will
be
willing
to
credit
me
i
wished
to
save
the
murderer
whom
i
had
some
reason
as
you
see
for
thinking
i
knew
from
the
consequences
of
his
own
action
courtney
talbot
and
even
sutherland
who
naturally
believed
she
referred
to
zabel
and
who
one
and
all
had
a
lingering
tenderness
for
this
unfortunate
old
man
which
not
even
this
seeming
act
of
madness
on
his
part
could
quite
destroy
felt
a
species
of
reaction
at
this
and
surveyed
the
singular
being
before
them
with
perhaps
the
slightest
shade
of
relenting
in
their
severity
sweetwater
alone
betrayed
restlessness
knapp
showed
no
feeling
at
all
while
frederick
stood
like
one
petrified
and
moved
neither
hand
nor
foot
crime
is
despicable
when
it
results
from
cupidity
only
she
went
on
with
a
deliberateness
so
hard
that
the
more
susceptible
of
her
auditors
shuddered
but
crime
that
springs
from
some
imperative
and
overpowering
necessity
of
the
mind
or
body
might
well
awaken
sympathy
and
i
am
not
ashamed
of
having
been
sorry
for
this
frenzied
and
suffering
man
weak
and
impulsive
as
you
may
consider
me
i
did
not
want
him
to
suffer
on
account
of
a
moment
madness
as
he
undoubtedly
would
if
he
were
ever
found
with
agatha
webb
money
in
his
possession
so
i
plunged
it
deeper
into
the
soil
and
trusted
to
the
confusion
which
crime
always
awakens
even
in
the
strongest
mind
for
him
not
to
discover
its
till
the
danger
connected
with
it
was
over
ha
wonderful
devilish
subtle
eh
clever
too
clever
were
some
of
the
whispered
exclamations
which
this
curious
explanation
on
her
part
brought
out
yet
only
sweetwater
showed
his
open
and
entire
disbelief
of
the
story
the
others
possibly
remembering
that
for
such
natures
as
hers
there
is
no
governing
law
and
no
commonplace
interpretation
to
sweetwater
however
this
was
but
so
much
display
of
feminine
resource
and
subtlety
though
he
felt
he
should
keep
still
in
the
presence
of
men
so
greatly
his
superiors
he
could
not
resist
saying
truth
is
sometimes
stranger
than
fiction
i
should
never
have
attributed
any
such
motive
as
you
mention
to
the
young
girl
i
saw
leaving
this
spot
with
many
a
backward
glance
at
the
hole
from
which
we
afterwards
extracted
the
large
sum
of
money
in
question
but
say
that
this
reburying
of
stolen
funds
was
out
of
consideration
for
the
feeble
old
man
you
describe
as
having
carried
them
there
do
you
not
see
that
by
this
act
you
can
be
held
as
an
accessory
after
the
fact
her
eyebrows
went
up
and
the
delicate
curve
of
her
lips
was
not
without
menace
as
she
said
you
hate
me
sweetwater
do
you
wish
me
to
tell
these
gentlemen
why
the
flush
which
notwithstanding
this
peculiar
young
man
nerve
instantly
crimsoned
his
features
was
a
surprise
to
frederick
so
was
it
to
the
others
who
saw
in
it
a
possible
hint
as
to
the
real
cause
of
his
persistent
pursuit
of
this
young
girl
which
they
had
hitherto
ascribed
entirely
to
his
love
of
justice
slighted
love
makes
some
hearts
venomous
could
this
ungainly
fellow
have
once
loved
and
been
disdained
by
this
bewitching
piece
of
unreliability
it
was
a
very
possible
assumption
though
sweetwater
blush
was
the
only
answer
he
gave
to
her
question
which
nevertheless
had
amply
served
its
turn
to
fill
the
gap
caused
by
his
silence
sutherland
made
an
effort
and
addressed
her
himself
your
conduct
said
he
has
not
been
that
of
a
strictly
honourable
person
why
did
you
fail
to
give
the
alarm
when
you
my
house
after
being
witness
to
this
double
tragedy
her
serenity
was
not
to
be
disturbed
i
have
just
explained
she
reminded
him
that
i
had
sympathy
for
the
criminal
we
all
have
sympathy
for
james
zabel
but
i
do
not
believe
one
word
of
this
story
interposed
sweetwater
in
reckless
disregard
of
proprieties
a
hungry
feeble
old
man
like
zabel
on
the
verge
of
death
could
not
have
found
his
way
into
these
woods
you
carried
the
money
there
yourself
miss
you
are
the
hush
interposed
the
coroner
authoritatively
do
not
let
us
go
too
fast
yet
miss
page
has
an
air
of
speaking
the
truth
strange
and
unaccountable
as
it
may
seem
zabel
was
an
admirable
man
once
and
if
he
was
led
into
theft
and
murder
it
was
not
until
his
faculties
had
been
weakened
by
his
own
suffering
and
that
of
his
brother
thank
you
was
her
simple
reply
and
for
the
first
time
every
man
there
thrilled
at
her
tone
seeing
it
all
the
dangerous
fascination
of
her
look
and
manner
returned
upon
her
with
double
force
i
have
been
unwise
said
she
and
let
my
sympathy
run
away
with
my
judgment
women
have
impulses
of
this
kind
sometimes
and
men
blame
them
for
it
till
they
themselves
come
to
the
point
of
feeling
the
need
of
just
such
blind
devotion
i
am
sure
i
regret
my
now
for
i
have
lost
esteem
by
it
while
he
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
she
dismissed
the
subject
and
talbot
watching
her
felt
a
shade
of
his
distrust
leave
him
and
in
its
place
a
species
of
admiration
for
the
lithe
graceful
bewitching
personality
before
them
with
her
childish
impulses
and
womanly
wit
which
half
mystified
and
half
imposed
upon
them
sutherland
on
the
contrary
was
neither
charmed
from
his
antagonism
nor
convinced
of
her
honesty
there
was
something
in
this
matter
that
could
not
be
explained
away
by
her
argument
and
his
suspicion
of
that
something
he
felt
perfectly
sure
was
shared
by
his
son
toward
whose
cold
set
face
he
had
frequently
cast
the
most
uneasy
glances
he
was
not
ready
however
to
probe
into
the
subject
more
deeply
nor
could
he
for
the
sake
of
frederick
urge
on
to
any
further
confession
a
young
woman
whom
his
unhappy
son
professed
to
love
and
in
whose
discretion
he
had
so
little
confidence
as
for
sweetwater
he
had
now
fully
recovered
his
and
bore
himself
with
great
discretion
when
talbot
finally
said
well
gentlemen
we
have
got
more
than
we
expected
when
we
came
here
this
morning
there
remains
however
a
point
regarding
which
we
have
received
no
explanation
miss
page
how
came
that
orchid
which
i
am
told
you
wore
in
your
hair
at
the
dance
to
be
found
lying
near
the
hem
of
batsy
skirts
you
distinctly
told
us
that
you
did
not
go
when
you
were
in
webb
house
ah
that
so
acquiesced
the
boston
detective
dryly
how
came
that
flower
on
the
scene
of
the
murder
she
smiled
and
seemed
equal
to
the
emergency
that
is
a
mystery
for
us
all
to
solve
she
said
quietly
frankly
meeting
the
eyes
of
her
questioner
a
mystery
it
is
your
business
to
solve
corrected
the
district
attorney
nothing
that
you
have
told
us
in
support
of
your
innocence
would
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
weigh
for
one
instant
against
the
complicity
shown
by
that
one
piece
of
circumstantial
evidence
against
you
her
smile
carried
a
certain
denial
of
this
to
one
heart
there
at
least
but
her
words
were
humble
enough
i
am
aware
of
that
said
she
then
turning
to
where
sweetwater
stood
lowering
upon
her
from
out
his
eyes
she
impetuously
exclaimed
you
sir
who
with
no
excuse
an
honourable
person
can
recognise
have
seen
fit
to
arrogate
to
yourself
duties
wholly
out
of
your
province
prove
yourself
equal
to
your
presumption
by
ferreting
out
alone
and
unassisted
the
secret
of
this
mystery
it
can
be
done
for
mark
did
not
carry
that
flower
into
the
room
where
it
was
found
this
i
am
ready
to
assert
before
god
and
before
man
her
hand
was
raised
her
whole
attitude
spoke
defiance
and
hard
as
it
was
for
sweetwater
to
acknowledge
it
truth
he
felt
that
he
had
received
a
challenge
and
with
a
quick
glance
at
knapp
who
barely
responded
by
a
shrug
he
shifted
over
to
the
side
of
talbot
amabel
at
once
dropped
her
hand
may
i
go
she
now
cried
appealingly
to
courtney
i
really
have
no
more
to
say
and
i
am
tired
did
you
see
the
figure
of
the
man
who
brushed
by
you
in
the
wood
was
it
that
of
the
old
man
you
saw
on
the
doorstep
at
this
direct
question
frederick
quivered
in
spite
of
his
dogged
but
she
with
her
face
upturned
to
meet
the
scrutiny
of
the
speaker
showed
only
a
childish
kind
of
wonder
why
do
you
ask
that
is
there
any
doubt
about
its
being
the
same
what
an
actress
she
was
frederick
stood
appalled
he
had
been
amazed
at
the
skill
with
which
she
had
manipulated
her
story
so
as
to
keep
her
promise
to
him
and
yet
leave
the
way
open
for
that
further
confession
which
would
alter
the
whole
into
a
denunciation
of
himself
which
he
would
find
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
meet
but
this
extreme
dissimulation
made
him
lose
heart
it
showed
her
to
be
an
antagonist
of
almost
illimitable
resource
and
secret
determination
i
did
not
suppose
there
could
be
any
doubt
she
added
in
such
a
natural
tone
of
surprise
that
courtney
dropped
the
subject
and
talbot
turned
to
sweetwater
who
for
the
moment
seemed
to
have
robbed
knapp
of
his
rightful
place
as
the
coroner
confidant
shall
we
let
her
go
for
the
present
he
whispered
she
does
look
tired
poor
girl
the
public
challenge
which
sweetwater
had
received
made
him
wary
and
his
reply
was
a
guarded
one
i
do
not
trust
her
yet
there
is
much
to
confirm
her
story
those
sandwiches
now
she
says
she
dropped
them
in
webb
yard
under
the
pear
tree
and
that
the
bag
that
held
them
burst
open
gentlemen
the
birds
were
so
busy
there
on
the
morning
after
the
murder
that
i
could
not
but
notice
them
notwithstanding
my
absorption
in
greater
matters
i
remember
wondering
what
they
were
all
pecking
at
so
eagerly
but
how
about
the
flower
whose
presence
on
the
scene
of
guilt
she
challenges
me
to
explain
and
the
money
so
deftly
reburied
by
her
can
any
explanation
make
her
other
than
accessory
to
a
crime
on
whose
fruits
she
lays
her
hand
in
a
way
tending
solely
to
concealment
no
sirs
and
so
i
shall
not
relax
my
vigilance
over
her
even
if
in
order
to
be
faithful
to
it
i
have
to
suggest
that
a
warrant
be
made
out
for
her
imprisonment
you
are
right
acquiesced
the
coroner
and
turning
to
miss
page
he
told
her
she
was
too
valuable
a
witness
to
be
lost
sight
of
and
requested
her
to
prepare
to
accompany
him
into
town
she
made
no
objection
on
the
contrary
her
cheeks
dimpled
and
she
turned
away
with
alacrity
towards
her
room
but
before
the
door
closed
on
her
she
looked
back
and
with
a
persuasive
smile
remarked
that
she
had
told
all
she
knew
or
thought
she
knew
at
the
time
but
that
perhaps
after
thinking
the
matter
carefully
over
she
might
remember
some
detail
that
would
throw
some
extra
light
on
the
subject
call
her
back
cried
courtney
she
is
withholding
something
let
us
hear
it
all
but
sutherland
with
a
side
look
at
frederick
persuaded
the
district
attorney
to
postpone
all
further
examination
of
this
artful
girl
until
they
were
alone
the
anxious
father
had
noted
what
the
rest
were
too
preoccupied
to
observe
that
frederick
had
reached
the
limit
of
his
strength
and
could
not
be
trusted
to
preserve
his
composure
any
longer
in
face
of
this
searching
examination
into
the
conduct
of
a
woman
from
whom
he
had
so
lately
detached
himself
xix
poor
philemon
the
next
day
was
the
day
of
agatha
funeral
she
was
to
be
buried
in
portchester
by
the
side
of
her
six
children
and
as
the
day
was
fine
the
whole
town
as
by
common
consent
assembled
in
the
road
along
which
the
humble
cortege
was
to
make
its
way
to
the
spot
indicated
from
the
windows
of
farmhouses
from
between
the
trees
of
the
few
scattered
thickets
along
the
way
saddened
and
curious
faces
looked
forth
till
sweetwater
who
walked
as
near
as
he
dared
to
the
immediate
friends
of
the
deceased
felt
the
impossibility
of
remembering
them
all
and
gave
up
the
task
in
despair
before
one
house
about
a
mile
out
of
town
the
procession
paused
and
at
a
gesture
from
the
minister
everyone
within
sight
took
off
their
hats
amid
a
hush
which
made
almost
painfully
apparent
the
twittering
of
birds
and
the
other
sounds
of
animate
and
inanimate
nature
which
are
inseparable
from
a
country
road
they
had
reached
widow
jones
cottage
in
which
philemon
was
then
staying
the
front
door
was
closed
and
so
were
the
lower
windows
but
in
one
of
the
upper
casements
a
movement
was
perceptible
and
in
another
instant
there
came
into
view
a
woman
and
man
supporting
between
them
the
impassive
form
of
agatha
husband
holding
him
up
in
plain
sight
of
the
almost
breathless
throng
below
the
woman
pointed
to
where
his
darling
lay
and
appeared
to
say
something
to
him
then
there
was
to
be
seen
a
strange
sight
the
old
man
with
his
thin
white
locks
fluttering
in
the
breeze
leaned
forward
with
a
smile
and
holding
out
his
arms
cried
in
a
faint
but
joyful
tone
agatha
then
as
if
realising
for
the
first
time
that
it
was
death
he
looked
upon
and
that
the
crowd
below
was
a
funeral
procession
his
face
altered
and
he
fell
back
with
a
low
heartbroken
moan
into
the
arms
of
those
who
supported
him
as
his
white
head
disappeared
from
sight
the
procession
moved
on
and
from
only
one
pair
of
lips
went
up
that
groan
of
sorrow
with
which
every
heart
seemed
surcharged
one
groan
from
whose
lips
did
it
come
sweetwater
endeavoured
to
ascertain
but
was
not
able
nor
could
anyone
inform
him
unless
it
was
sutherland
whom
he
dared
not
approach
this
gentleman
was
on
foot
like
the
rest
with
his
arm
fast
linked
in
that
of
his
son
frederick
he
had
meant
to
ride
for
the
distance
was
long
for
men
past
sixty
but
finding
the
latter
resolved
to
walk
he
had
consented
to
do
the
same
rather
than
be
separated
from
his
son
he
had
fears
for
frederick
he
could
hardly
have
told
why
and
as
the
ceremony
proceeded
and
agatha
was
solemnly
laid
away
in
the
place
prepared
for
her
his
sympathies
grew
upon
him
to
such
an
extent
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
quit
the
young
man
for
a
moment
or
even
to
turn
his
eyes
away
from
the
face
he
had
never
seemed
to
know
till
now
but
as
friends
and
strangers
were
now
leaving
the
yard
he
controlled
himself
and
assuming
a
more
natural
demeanour
asked
his
son
if
he
were
now
ready
to
ride
back
but
to
his
astonishment
frederick
replied
that
he
did
not
intend
to
return
to
sutherlandtown
at
present
that
he
had
business
in
portchester
and
that
he
was
doubtful
as
to
when
he
would
be
ready
to
return
as
the
old
gentleman
did
not
wish
to
raise
a
controversy
he
said
nothing
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
frederick
disappear
up
the
road
he
sent
back
the
carriage
he
had
ordered
saying
that
he
would
return
in
a
portchester
gig
as
soon
as
he
had
settled
some
affairs
of
his
own
which
might
and
might
not
detain
him
there
till
evening
then
he
proceeded
to
a
little
inn
where
he
hired
a
room
with
windows
that
looked
out
on
the
in
one
of
these
windows
he
sat
all
day
watching
for
frederick
who
had
gone
farther
up
the
road
but
no
frederick
appeared
and
with
vague
misgivings
for
which
as
yet
he
had
no
name
he
left
the
window
and
set
out
on
foot
for
home
it
was
now
dark
but
a
silvery
gleam
on
the
horizon
gave
promise
of
the
speedy
rising
of
a
full
moon
otherwise
he
would
not
have
attempted
to
walk
over
a
road
proverbially
dark
and
dismal
the
churchyard
in
which
they
had
just
laid
away
agatha
lay
in
his
course
as
he
approached
it
he
felt
his
heart
fail
and
stopping
a
moment
at
the
stone
wall
that
separated
it
from
the
he
leaned
against
the
trunk
of
a
huge
elm
that
guarded
the
gate
of
entrance
as
he
did
so
he
heard
a
sound
of
repressed
sobbing
from
some
spot
not
very
far
away
and
moved
by
some
undefinable
impulse
stronger
than
his
will
he
pushed
open
the
gate
and
entered
the
sacred
precincts
instantly
the
weirdness
and
desolation
of
the
spot
struck
him
he
wished
yet
dreaded
to
advance
something
in
the
grief
of
the
mourner
whose
sobs
he
had
heard
had
seized
upon
his
and
yet
as
he
hesitated
the
sounds
came
again
and
forgetting
that
his
intrusion
might
not
prove
altogether
welcome
he
pressed
forward
till
he
came
within
a
few
feet
of
the
spot
from
which
the
sobs
issued
he
had
moved
quietly
feeling
the
awesomeness
of
the
place
and
when
he
paused
it
was
with
a
sensation
of
dread
not
to
be
entirely
explained
by
the
sad
and
dismal
surroundings
dark
as
it
was
he
discerned
the
outline
of
a
form
lying
stretched
in
speechless
misery
across
a
grave
but
when
impelled
by
an
almost
irresistible
compassion
he
strove
to
speak
his
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
and
he
only
drew
back
farther
into
the
shadow
he
had
recognised
the
mourner
and
the
grave
the
mourner
was
frederick
and
the
grave
that
of
agatha
webb
a
few
minutes
later
sutherland
reappeared
at
the
door
of
the
inn
and
asked
for
a
gig
and
driver
to
take
him
back
to
sutherlandtown
he
said
in
excuse
for
his
indecision
that
he
had
undertaken
to
walk
but
had
found
his
strength
inadequate
to
the
exertion
he
was
looking
very
pale
and
trembled
so
that
the
landlord
who
took
his
order
asked
him
if
he
were
ill
but
sutherland
insisted
that
he
was
quite
well
only
in
a
hurry
and
showed
the
greatest
impatience
till
he
was
again
started
upon
the
road
for
the
first
he
sat
perfectly
silent
the
moon
was
now
up
and
the
road
stretched
before
them
flooded
with
light
as
long
as
no
one
was
to
be
seen
on
this
road
or
on
the
path
running
beside
it
sutherland
held
himself
erect
his
eyes
fixed
before
him
in
an
attitude
of
anxious
inquiry
but
as
soon
as
any
sound
came
to
break
the
silence
or
there
appeared
in
the
distance
ahead
of
them
the
least
appearance
of
a
plodding
wayfarer
he
drew
back
and
hid
himself
in
the
recesses
of
the
vehicle
this
happened
several
times
then
his
whole
manner
changed
they
had
just
passed
frederick
walking
with
bowed
head
toward
sutherlandtown
but
he
was
not
the
only
person
on
the
road
at
this
time
a
few
minutes
previously
they
had
passed
another
man
walking
in
the
same
direction
as
sutherland
mused
over
this
he
found
himself
peering
through
the
small
window
at
the
back
of
the
buggy
striving
to
catch
another
glimpse
of
the
two
men
plodding
behind
him
he
could
see
them
both
his
form
throwing
its
long
shadow
over
the
moonlit
road
followed
only
too
closely
by
the
man
whose
ungainly
shape
he
feared
to
acknowledge
to
himself
was
growing
only
too
familiar
in
his
eyes
falling
into
a
troubled
reverie
he
beheld
the
houses
and
the
great
trees
under
whose
shadow
he
had
grown
from
youth
to
manhood
flit
by
him
like
phantoms
in
a
dream
but
suddenly
one
house
and
one
place
drew
his
attention
with
a
force
that
startled
him
again
into
an
erect
attitude
and
seizing
with
one
hand
the
arm
of
the
driver
he
pointed
with
the
other
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
they
were
passing
saying
in
choked
tones
see
see
something
dreadful
has
happened
since
we
passed
by
here
this
morning
that
is
crape
samuel
crape
hanging
from
the
doorpost
yonder
yes
it
is
crape
answered
the
driver
jumping
out
and
running
up
the
path
to
look
philemon
must
be
dead
the
good
philemon
here
was
a
fresh
blow
sutherland
bowed
before
it
for
a
moment
then
he
rose
hurriedly
and
stepped
down
into
the
road
beside
the
driver
get
in
again
said
he
and
drive
on
ride
a
then
come
back
for
me
i
must
see
the
widow
jones
the
driver
awed
both
by
the
occasion
and
the
feeling
it
had
called
up
in
sutherland
did
as
he
was
bid
and
drove
away
sutherland
with
a
glance
back
at
the
road
he
had
just
traversed
walked
painfully
up
the
path
to
jones
door
a
moment
conversation
with
the
woman
who
answered
his
summons
proved
the
driver
supposition
to
be
correct
philemon
had
passed
away
he
had
never
rallied
from
the
shock
he
had
received
he
had
joined
his
beloved
agatha
on
the
day
of
her
burial
and
the
long
tragedy
of
their
mutual
life
was
over
it
is
a
mercy
that
no
inheritor
of
their
misfortune
remains
quoth
the
good
woman
as
she
saw
the
affliction
her
tidings
caused
in
this
friend
the
assent
sutherland
gave
was
mechanical
he
was
anxiously
studying
the
road
leading
toward
portchester
suddenly
he
stepped
hastily
into
the
house
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
sit
down
in
your
parlour
for
a
few
minutes
he
asked
i
should
like
to
rest
there
for
an
instant
alone
this
final
blow
has
upset
me
the
good
woman
bowed
sutherland
word
was
law
in
that
town
she
did
not
even
dare
to
protest
against
the
alone
which
he
had
so
pointedly
emphasised
but
left
him
after
making
him
as
she
said
comfortable
and
went
back
to
her
duties
in
the
room
above
it
was
fortunate
she
was
so
amenable
to
his
wishes
for
no
sooner
had
her
steps
ceased
to
be
heard
than
sutherland
rose
from
the
in
which
he
had
been
seated
and
putting
out
the
lamp
widow
jones
had
insisted
on
lighting
passed
directly
to
the
window
through
which
he
began
to
peer
with
looks
of
the
deepest
anxiety
a
man
was
coming
up
the
road
a
young
man
frederick
as
sutherland
recognised
him
he
leaned
forward
with
increased
anxiety
till
at
the
appearance
of
his
son
in
front
his
scrutiny
grew
so
strained
and
penetrating
that
it
seemed
to
exercise
a
magnetic
influence
upon
frederick
causing
him
to
look
up
the
glance
he
gave
the
house
was
but
momentary
but
in
that
glance
the
father
saw
all
that
he
had
secretly
dreaded
as
his
son
eye
fell
on
that
fluttering
bit
of
crape
testifying
to
another
death
in
this
already
community
he
staggered
wildly
then
in
a
pause
of
doubt
drew
nearer
and
nearer
till
his
fingers
grasped
this
symbol
of
mourning
and
clung
there
next
moment
he
was
far
down
the
road
plunging
toward
home
in
a
state
of
great
mental
disorder
a
afterwards
sutherland
reached
home
he
had
not
overtaken
frederick
again
or
even
his
accompanying
shadow
ascertaining
at
his
own
door
that
his
son
had
not
yet
come
in
but
had
been
seen
going
farther
up
the
hill
he
turned
back
again
into
the
road
and
proceeded
after
him
on
foot
the
next
place
to
his
own
was
occupied
by
halliday
as
he
approached
it
he
caught
sight
of
a
man
standing
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
honeysuckle
porch
whom
he
at
first
thought
to
be
frederick
but
he
soon
saw
that
it
was
the
fellow
who
had
been
following
his
son
all
the
way
from
portchester
and
controlling
his
first
movement
of
dislike
he
stepped
up
to
him
and
quietly
said
sweetwater
is
this
you
the
young
man
fell
back
and
showed
a
most
extraordinary
agitation
quickly
suppressed
however
yes
sir
it
is
no
one
else
do
you
know
what
i
am
doing
here
i
fear
i
do
you
have
been
to
portchester
you
have
seen
my
son
sweetwater
made
a
hurried
almost
an
entreating
gesture
never
mind
that
sutherland
i
had
rather
you
would
say
anything
about
that
i
am
as
much
broken
up
by
what
i
have
seen
as
you
are
i
never
suspected
him
of
having
any
direct
connection
with
this
murder
only
the
girl
to
whom
he
has
so
unfortunately
attached
himself
but
after
what
i
have
seen
what
am
i
to
think
what
am
i
to
do
i
honour
you
i
would
not
grieve
you
but
but
oh
sir
perhaps
you
can
help
me
out
of
the
maze
into
which
i
have
stumbled
perhaps
you
can
assure
me
that
frederick
did
not
leave
the
ball
at
the
time
she
did
i
missed
him
from
among
the
dancers
i
did
not
see
him
between
twelve
and
three
but
perhaps
you
did
and
and
his
voice
broke
he
was
almost
as
profoundly
agitated
as
sutherland
as
for
the
latter
who
found
himself
unable
to
reassure
the
other
on
this
very
vital
point
having
no
remembrance
himself
of
having
seen
frederick
among
his
guests
during
those
fatal
hours
he
stood
speechless
lost
in
abysses
the
depth
and
horror
of
which
only
a
father
can
appreciate
sweetwater
respected
his
anguish
and
for
a
moment
was
silent
himself
then
he
burst
out
i
had
rather
never
lived
to
see
this
day
than
be
the
cause
of
shame
or
suffering
to
you
tell
me
what
to
do
shall
i
be
deaf
dumb
here
sutherland
found
voice
you
make
too
much
of
what
you
saw
said
he
my
boy
has
faults
and
has
lived
anything
but
a
satisfactory
life
but
he
is
not
as
bad
as
you
would
intimate
he
can
never
have
taken
life
that
would
be
incredible
monstrous
in
one
brought
up
as
he
has
been
besides
if
he
were
so
far
gone
in
evil
as
to
be
willing
to
attempt
crime
he
had
no
motive
to
do
so
sweetwater
he
had
no
motive
a
few
hundred
dollars
but
these
he
could
have
got
from
me
and
did
but
why
did
the
wretched
father
stop
did
he
recall
the
circumstances
under
which
frederick
had
obtained
these
last
hundreds
from
him
they
were
not
ordinary
circumstances
and
frederick
had
been
in
no
ordinary
strait
sutherland
could
not
but
acknowledge
to
himself
that
there
was
something
in
this
whole
matter
which
contradicted
the
very
plea
he
was
making
and
not
being
able
to
establish
the
conviction
of
his
innocence
in
his
own
mind
he
was
too
honourable
to
try
to
establish
it
in
that
of
another
his
next
words
betrayed
the
depth
of
his
struggle
it
is
that
girl
who
has
ruined
him
sweetwater
he
loves
but
doubts
her
as
who
could
help
doing
after
the
story
she
told
us
day
before
yesterday
indeed
he
has
doubted
her
ever
since
that
fatal
night
and
it
is
this
which
has
broken
his
heart
and
not
not
again
the
old
gentleman
paused
again
he
recovered
himself
this
time
with
a
touch
of
his
usual
dignity
and
leave
me
he
cried
nothing
that
you
have
seen
has
escaped
me
but
our
interpretations
of
it
may
differ
i
will
watch
over
my
son
from
this
hour
and
you
may
trust
my
vigilance
sweetwater
bowed
you
have
a
right
to
command
me
said
he
you
may
have
forgotten
but
i
have
not
that
i
owe
my
life
to
you
years
ago
perhaps
you
can
recall
it
it
was
at
the
black
pond
i
was
going
down
for
the
third
time
and
my
mother
was
screaming
in
terror
on
the
bank
when
you
plunged
in
and
well
sir
such
things
are
never
forgotten
and
as
i
said
before
you
have
only
to
command
me
he
turned
to
go
but
suddenly
came
back
there
were
signs
of
mental
conflict
in
his
face
and
voice
sutherland
i
am
not
a
talkative
man
if
i
trust
your
vigilance
you
may
trust
my
discretion
only
i
must
have
your
word
that
you
will
convey
no
warning
to
your
son
sutherland
made
an
indefinable
gesture
and
sweetwater
again
disappeared
this
time
not
to
return
as
for
sutherland
he
remained
standing
before
halliday
door
what
had
the
young
man
meant
by
this
emphatic
repetition
of
his
former
suggestion
that
he
would
be
quiet
also
and
not
speak
of
what
he
had
seen
why
then
but
to
the
hope
thus
given
this
gentleman
would
yield
no
quarter
and
seeing
a
duty
before
him
a
duty
he
dare
not
shirk
he
brought
his
emotions
violent
as
they
were
into
complete
and
absolute
subjection
and
opening
halliday
door
entered
the
house
they
were
old
neighbours
and
ceremony
was
ignored
between
them
finding
the
hall
empty
and
the
parlour
door
open
he
walked
immediately
into
the
latter
room
the
sight
that
met
his
eyes
never
left
his
memory
agnes
his
little
agnes
whom
he
had
always
loved
and
whom
he
had
vainly
longed
to
call
by
the
endearing
name
of
daughter
sat
with
her
face
towards
him
looking
up
at
frederick
that
young
gentleman
had
just
spoken
to
her
or
she
had
just
received
something
from
his
hand
for
her
own
was
held
out
and
her
expression
was
one
of
gratitude
and
acceptance
she
was
not
a
beautiful
girl
but
she
had
a
beautiful
look
and
at
this
moment
it
was
exalted
by
a
feeling
the
old
gentleman
had
once
longed
but
now
dreaded
inexpressibly
to
see
there
what
could
it
mean
why
did
she
show
at
this
unhappy
crisis
interest
devotion
passion
almost
for
one
she
had
regarded
with
open
scorn
when
it
was
the
dearest
wish
of
his
heart
to
see
them
united
it
was
one
of
the
contradictions
of
our
mysterious
human
nature
and
at
this
crisis
and
in
this
moment
of
secret
and
miserable
doubt
it
made
the
old
gentleman
shrink
with
his
first
feeling
of
actual
despair
the
next
moment
agnes
had
risen
and
they
were
both
facing
him
agnes
sutherland
forced
himself
to
speak
lightly
ah
frederick
do
i
find
you
here
the
latter
question
had
more
constraint
in
it
frederick
smiled
there
was
an
air
of
relief
about
him
almost
of
cheerfulness
i
was
just
leaving
said
he
i
was
the
bearer
of
a
message
to
miss
halliday
he
had
always
called
her
agnes
before
sutherland
who
had
found
his
faculties
confused
by
the
expression
he
had
surprised
on
the
young
girl
face
answered
with
a
divided
attention
and
i
have
a
message
to
give
you
wait
outside
on
the
porch
for
me
frederick
till
i
exchange
a
word
with
our
little
friend
here
agnes
who
had
thrust
something
she
held
into
a
box
that
lay
beside
her
on
a
table
turned
with
a
confused
blush
to
listen
sutherland
waited
till
frederick
had
stepped
into
the
hall
then
he
drew
agnes
to
one
side
and
remorselessly
persistently
raised
her
face
toward
him
till
she
was
forced
to
meet
his
benevolent
but
searching
regard
do
you
know
he
whispered
in
what
he
endeavoured
to
make
a
bantering
tone
how
very
few
days
it
is
since
that
unhappy
boy
yonder
confessed
his
love
for
a
young
lady
whose
name
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
utter
in
your
presence
the
intent
was
kind
but
the
effect
was
unexpectedly
cruel
with
a
droop
of
her
head
and
a
hurried
gasp
which
conveyed
a
mixture
of
entreaty
and
reproach
agnes
drew
back
in
a
vague
endeavour
to
hide
her
sudden
uneasiness
he
saw
his
mistake
and
let
his
hands
drop
do
my
dear
he
whispered
i
had
no
idea
it
would
hurt
you
to
hear
this
you
have
always
seemed
indifferent
hard
even
toward
my
scapegrace
son
and
this
was
right
for
for
what
could
he
say
how
express
of
that
with
which
his
breast
was
labouring
he
could
not
he
dared
not
so
ended
as
we
have
intimated
by
a
confused
stammering
agnes
who
had
never
before
seen
this
object
of
her
lifelong
admiration
under
any
serious
emotion
felt
an
impulse
of
remorse
as
if
she
herself
had
been
guilty
of
occasioning
him
embarrassment
plucking
up
her
courage
she
wistfully
eyed
him
did
you
imagine
she
murmured
that
i
needed
any
warning
against
frederick
who
has
never
honoured
me
with
his
regard
as
he
has
the
young
lady
you
can
not
mention
i
afraid
you
do
know
me
sutherland
notwithstanding
i
have
sat
on
your
knee
and
sometimes
plucked
at
your
beard
in
my
infantile
insistence
upon
attention
i
am
afraid
i
do
know
you
he
answered
i
feel
that
i
know
nobody
now
not
even
my
son
he
had
hoped
she
would
look
up
at
this
but
she
did
not
will
my
little
girl
think
me
very
curious
and
very
impertinent
if
i
ask
her
what
my
son
frederick
was
saying
when
i
came
into
the
room
she
looked
up
now
and
with
visible
candour
answered
him
immediately
and
to
the
point
frederick
is
in
trouble
sutherland
he
has
felt
the
need
of
a
friend
who
could
appreciate
this
and
he
has
asked
me
to
be
that
friend
besides
he
brought
me
a
packet
of
letters
which
he
entreated
me
to
keep
for
him
i
took
them
sutherland
and
i
will
keep
them
as
he
asked
me
to
do
safe
from
everybody
inspection
even
my
own
oh
why
had
he
questioned
her
he
did
not
want
to
know
of
these
letters
he
did
not
want
to
know
that
frederick
possessed
anything
which
he
was
afraid
to
retain
in
his
own
possession
my
son
did
wrong
said
he
to
confide
anything
to
your
care
which
he
did
not
desire
to
retain
in
his
own
home
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
see
these
letters
for
if
my
son
is
in
trouble
as
you
say
i
his
father
ought
to
know
it
i
am
not
sure
about
that
she
smiled
his
trouble
may
be
of
a
different
nature
than
you
imagine
frederick
has
led
a
life
that
he
regrets
i
think
his
chief
source
of
suffering
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
is
so
hard
for
him
to
make
others
believe
that
he
means
to
do
differently
in
the
future
does
he
mean
to
do
differently
she
flushed
he
says
so
sutherland
and
i
for
one
can
not
help
believing
him
do
you
see
that
he
begins
to
look
like
another
man
sutherland
was
taken
aback
he
had
noticed
this
fact
and
had
found
it
a
hard
one
to
understand
to
ascertain
what
her
explanation
of
it
might
be
he
replied
at
once
there
is
a
change
in
him
a
very
evident
change
what
is
the
occasion
of
it
to
what
do
you
ascribe
it
agnes
how
breathlessly
he
waited
for
her
answer
had
she
any
suspicion
of
the
awful
doubts
which
were
so
deeply
agitating
himself
that
night
she
did
not
appear
to
have
i
hesitate
she
faltered
but
not
from
any
doubt
of
frederick
to
tell
you
just
what
i
think
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
sudden
change
observable
in
him
miss
page
you
see
i
can
name
her
if
you
can
not
has
proved
herself
so
unworthy
of
his
regard
that
the
shock
he
has
received
has
opened
his
eyes
to
certain
failings
of
his
own
which
made
his
weakness
in
her
regard
possible
i
do
not
know
of
any
other
explanation
do
you
at
this
direct
question
breathed
though
it
was
by
tender
lips
and
launched
in
ignorance
of
the
barb
which
carried
it
to
his
heart
sutherland
recoiled
and
cast
an
anxious
look
upon
the
door
then
with
forced
composure
he
quietly
said
if
you
who
are
so
much
nearer
his
age
and
let
me
hope
his
sympathy
do
not
feel
sure
of
his
real
feelings
how
should
i
who
am
his
father
but
have
never
been
his
confidant
oh
she
cried
holding
out
her
hands
such
a
good
father
some
day
he
will
appreciate
that
fact
as
well
as
others
believe
it
sutherland
believe
it
and
then
ashamed
of
her
glowing
interest
which
was
a
little
more
pronounced
than
became
her
simple
attitude
of
friend
toward
a
man
professedly
in
love
with
another
woman
she
faltered
and
cast
the
shyest
of
looks
upward
at
the
face
she
had
never
seen
turned
toward
her
with
anything
but
kindness
i
have
confidence
in
frederick
good
heart
she
added
with
something
like
dignity
would
god
that
i
could
share
it
was
the
only
answer
she
received
before
she
could
recover
from
the
shock
of
these
words
sutherland
was
gone
agnes
was
more
or
less
disconcerted
by
this
interview
there
was
a
lingering
in
her
step
that
night
as
she
trod
the
little
chamber
sacred
to
her
girlish
dreams
which
bespake
an
overcharged
heart
a
heart
that
before
she
slept
found
relief
in
these
few
words
whispered
by
her
into
the
night
air
laden
with
the
sweetness
of
honeysuckles
can
it
be
that
he
is
right
did
i
need
such
a
warning
i
who
have
hated
this
man
and
who
thought
that
it
was
my
hatred
which
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
think
of
anything
or
anybody
else
since
we
parted
from
each
other
last
night
o
me
if
it
is
so
and
from
the
great
wide
world
without
tremulous
with
moonlight
the
echo
seemed
to
come
back
woe
to
thee
agnes
halliday
if
this
be
so
xx
a
surprise
for
sutherland
meanwhile
sutherland
and
frederick
stood
facing
each
other
in
the
former
library
nothing
had
been
said
during
their
walk
down
the
hill
and
nothing
seemed
likely
to
proceed
from
frederick
now
though
his
father
waited
with
great
and
growing
agitation
for
some
explanation
that
would
relieve
the
immense
strain
on
his
heart
at
last
he
himself
spoke
dryly
as
we
all
speak
when
the
heart
is
fullest
and
we
fear
to
reveal
the
depth
of
our
emotions
what
papers
were
those
you
gave
into
agnes
halliday
keeping
anything
which
we
could
not
have
more
safely
not
to
say
discreetly
harboured
in
our
own
house
frederick
taken
aback
for
he
had
not
realised
that
his
father
had
seen
these
papers
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
he
boldly
said
they
were
letters
old
letters
which
i
felt
to
be
better
out
of
this
house
than
in
it
i
could
not
destroy
them
so
i
gave
them
into
the
guardianship
of
the
most
conscientious
person
i
know
i
hope
you
demand
to
see
those
letters
indeed
sir
i
hope
you
wo
demand
to
see
them
they
were
not
written
for
your
eye
and
i
would
rather
rest
under
your
displeasure
than
have
them
in
any
way
made
public
frederick
showed
such
earnestness
rather
than
fear
that
sutherland
was
astonished
when
were
these
letters
written
he
asked
lately
or
before
you
say
they
are
old
how
old
frederick
breath
came
easier
some
of
them
were
written
years
ago
most
of
them
in
fact
it
is
a
personal
matter
every
man
has
such
i
wish
i
could
have
destroyed
them
you
will
leave
them
with
agnes
sir
you
astonish
me
said
sutherland
relieved
that
he
could
at
least
hope
that
these
letters
were
in
nowise
connected
with
the
subject
of
his
own
frightful
suspicions
a
young
girl
to
whom
you
certainly
were
most
indifferent
a
week
ago
is
a
curious
guardian
of
letters
you
decline
to
show
your
father
i
know
it
was
frederick
sole
reply
somehow
the
humility
with
which
this
was
uttered
touched
sutherland
and
roused
hopes
he
had
supposed
dead
he
looked
his
son
for
the
first
time
directly
in
the
eye
and
with
a
beating
heart
said
your
secrets
if
you
have
such
might
better
be
entrusted
to
your
father
you
have
no
better
friend
and
there
he
stopped
with
a
horrified
despairing
feeling
of
inward
weakness
if
frederick
had
committed
a
crime
anything
would
be
better
than
knowing
it
turning
partially
aside
he
fingered
the
papers
on
the
desk
before
which
he
was
standing
a
large
envelope
containing
some
legal
document
lay
before
him
taking
it
up
mechanically
he
opened
it
frederick
as
mechanically
watched
him
i
know
said
the
latter
that
i
have
no
better
friend
you
have
been
too
good
too
indulgent
what
is
it
father
you
change
colour
look
ill
what
is
there
in
that
paper
sutherland
straightened
himself
there
was
a
great
reserve
of
strength
in
this
man
yet
fixing
frederick
with
a
gaze
more
penetrating
than
any
he
had
yet
bestowed
upon
him
he
folded
his
hands
behind
him
with
the
document
held
tightly
between
them
and
remarked
when
you
borrowed
that
money
from
me
you
did
it
like
a
man
who
expected
to
repay
it
why
whence
did
you
expect
to
receive
the
money
with
which
to
repay
me
answer
frederick
this
is
your
hour
for
confession
frederick
turned
so
pale
his
father
dropped
his
eyes
in
mercy
confess
he
repeated
what
should
i
confess
my
sins
they
are
too
many
as
for
that
money
i
hoped
to
return
it
as
any
son
might
hope
to
reimburse
his
father
for
money
advanced
to
pay
a
gambler
debt
i
said
i
meant
to
work
my
first
money
earned
shall
be
offered
to
you
i
well
well
his
father
was
holding
the
document
he
had
just
read
opened
out
before
his
eyes
did
you
expect
this
he
asked
did
you
know
that
that
poor
woman
that
wretchedly
murdered
most
unhappy
woman
whose
death
the
whole
town
mourns
had
made
you
her
heir
that
by
the
terms
of
this
document
seen
by
me
here
and
now
for
the
first
time
i
am
made
executor
and
you
the
inheritor
of
the
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
or
more
left
by
agatha
webb
no
cried
frederick
his
eyes
glued
to
the
paper
his
whole
face
and
form
expressing
something
more
akin
to
terror
than
surprise
has
she
done
this
why
should
she
i
hardly
knew
her
no
you
hardly
knew
her
and
she
she
hardly
knew
you
if
she
had
she
would
have
abhorred
rather
than
enriched
you
frederick
i
had
rather
see
you
dead
than
stand
before
me
the
inheritor
of
philemon
and
agatha
webb
savings
you
are
right
it
would
be
better
murmured
frederick
hardly
heeding
what
he
said
then
as
he
encountered
his
father
eye
resting
upon
him
with
implacable
scrutiny
he
added
in
weak
repetition
why
should
she
give
her
money
to
me
what
was
i
to
her
that
she
should
will
me
her
fortune
the
father
finger
trembled
to
a
certain
line
in
the
document
which
seemed
to
offer
some
explanation
of
this
but
frederick
did
not
follow
it
he
had
seen
that
his
father
was
expecting
a
reply
to
the
question
he
had
previously
put
and
he
was
casting
about
in
his
mind
how
to
answer
it
when
did
you
know
of
this
will
sutherland
now
repeated
for
know
of
it
you
did
before
you
came
to
me
for
money
frederick
summoned
up
his
full
courage
and
confronted
his
father
resolutely
no
said
he
i
did
not
know
of
it
it
is
as
much
of
a
surprise
to
me
as
it
is
to
you
he
lied
sutherland
knew
that
he
lied
and
frederick
knew
that
he
knew
it
a
shadow
fell
between
them
which
the
older
with
that
unspeakable
fear
upon
him
roused
by
sweetwater
whispered
suspicions
dared
no
longer
attempt
to
lift
after
a
few
minutes
in
which
frederick
seemed
to
see
his
father
age
before
his
eyes
sutherland
coldly
remarked
talbot
must
know
of
this
will
it
has
been
sent
here
to
me
from
boston
by
a
lawyer
who
drew
it
up
two
years
ago
the
coroner
may
not
as
yet
have
heard
of
it
will
you
accompany
me
to
his
office
i
should
like
to
have
him
see
that
we
wish
to
be
open
with
him
in
an
affair
of
such
importance
i
will
accompany
you
gladly
said
frederick
and
seeing
that
his
father
neither
wished
nor
was
able
to
say
anything
further
he
bowed
with
distant
ceremony
as
to
a
stranger
and
quietly
withdrew
but
when
the
door
had
closed
between
them
and
only
the
memory
of
his
changed
countenance
remained
to
trouble
him
he
paused
and
laid
his
hand
again
on
the
knob
as
if
tempted
to
return
but
he
left
without
doing
so
only
to
turn
again
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
gaze
wistfully
back
yet
he
went
on
as
he
opened
his
own
door
and
disappeared
within
he
said
half
audibly
easy
to
destroy
me
now
amabel
one
word
and
i
am
lost
book
ii
the
man
of
no
reputation
xxi
sweetwater
reasons
and
what
of
sweetwater
in
whose
thoughts
and
actions
the
interest
now
centres
when
he
left
sutherland
it
was
with
feelings
such
as
few
who
knew
him
supposed
him
capable
of
experiencing
unattractive
as
he
was
in
every
way
ungainly
in
figure
and
unprepossessing
of
countenance
this
butt
of
the
more
favoured
youth
in
town
had
a
heart
whose
secret
fires
were
all
the
warmer
for
being
so
persistently
covered
and
this
heart
was
wrung
with
trouble
and
heavy
with
a
struggle
that
bade
fair
to
leave
him
without
rest
that
night
if
not
for
many
nights
to
come
why
one
word
will
explain
unknown
to
the
world
at
large
and
almost
unknown
to
himself
his
best
affections
were
fixed
upon
the
man
whose
happiness
he
thus
unexpectedly
saw
himself
destined
to
destroy
he
loved
sutherland
the
suspicion
which
he
now
found
transferred
in
his
own
mind
from
the
young
girl
whose
slippers
he
had
purloined
during
the
excitement
of
the
first
alarm
to
the
unprincipled
but
only
son
of
his
one
benefactor
had
not
been
lightly
embraced
or
thoughtlessly
expressed
he
had
had
time
to
think
it
out
in
all
its
bearings
during
that
long
walk
from
portchester
churchyard
to
halliday
door
he
had
been
turning
over
in
his
mind
everything
that
he
had
heard
and
seen
in
connection
with
this
matter
till
the
dim
vision
of
figure
going
on
before
him
was
not
more
apparent
to
his
sight
than
was
the
guilt
he
so
deplored
to
his
inward
understanding
he
could
not
help
but
recognise
him
as
the
active
party
in
the
crime
he
had
hitherto
charged
amabel
with
with
the
clew
offered
by
secret
anguish
at
the
grave
of
agatha
he
could
read
the
whole
story
of
this
detestable
crime
as
plainly
as
if
it
had
been
written
in
letters
of
fire
on
the
circle
of
the
surrounding
darkness
such
anguish
under
such
circumstances
on
the
part
of
such
a
man
could
mean
but
one
thing
remorse
and
remorse
in
the
breast
of
one
so
proverbially
careless
and
corrupt
over
the
death
of
a
woman
who
was
neither
relative
nor
friend
could
have
but
one
interpretation
and
that
was
guilt
no
other
explanation
was
possible
could
one
be
given
or
if
any
evidence
could
be
adduced
in
contradiction
of
this
assumption
he
would
have
dismissed
his
new
suspicion
with
more
heartiness
even
than
he
had
embraced
his
former
one
he
did
not
wish
to
believe
frederick
guilty
he
would
have
purchased
an
inner
conviction
of
his
innocence
almost
at
the
price
of
his
own
life
not
because
of
any
latent
interest
in
the
young
man
himself
but
because
he
was
charles
sutherland
son
and
the
dear
if
unworthy
centre
of
all
that
noble
man
hopes
aims
and
happiness
but
he
could
come
upon
no
fact
capable
of
shaking
his
present
belief
taking
for
truth
amabel
account
of
what
she
had
seen
and
done
on
that
fatal
night
something
which
he
had
hesitated
over
the
previous
day
but
which
he
now
found
himself
forced
to
accept
or
do
violence
to
his
own
secret
convictions
and
adding
to
it
such
facts
as
had
come
to
his
own
knowledge
in
his
role
of
detective
he
had
but
to
test
the
events
of
that
night
by
his
present
theory
of
frederick
guilt
to
find
them
hang
together
in
a
way
too
complete
for
mistake
for
what
had
been
his
reasons
for
charging
amabel
herself
with
the
guilt
of
a
crime
she
only
professed
to
have
been
a
partial
witness
to
they
were
many
first
the
forced
nature
of
her
explanations
in
regard
to
her
motive
for
leaving
a
merry
ball
and
betaking
herself
to
the
midnight
road
in
her
party
dress
and
slippers
a
woman
of
her
unsympathetic
nature
might
use
the
misery
of
the
zabels
as
a
pretext
for
slipping
into
town
at
night
but
never
would
be
influenced
by
it
as
a
motive
second
the
equally
unsatisfactory
nature
of
the
reasons
she
gave
for
leaving
the
course
she
had
marked
out
for
herself
and
entering
upon
the
pursuit
of
an
unknown
man
into
a
house
in
which
she
had
no
personal
interest
and
from
which
she
had
just
seen
a
bloody
dagger
thrown
out
the
most
callous
of
women
would
have
shrunk
from
letting
her
curiosity
carry
her
thus
far
third
the
poverty
of
her
plea
that
after
having
braved
so
much
in
her
desire
to
identify
this
criminal
she
was
so
frightened
at
his
near
approach
as
to
fail
to
lift
her
head
when
the
opportunity
was
given
her
to
recognise
him
fourth
her
professed
inability
to
account
for
the
presence
of
the
orchid
from
her
hair
being
found
in
the
room
with
batsy
fifth
her
evident
attempt
to
throw
the
onus
of
the
crime
on
an
old
man
manifestly
incapable
from
physical
causes
of
committing
it
sixth
the
improbability
which
she
herself
should
have
recognised
of
this
old
man
in
his
extremely
weak
condition
ignoring
the
offered
by
the
woods
back
of
his
own
house
for
the
sake
of
one
not
only
involving
a
long
walk
but
situated
close
to
a
road
and
almost
in
view
of
the
sutherland
mansion
seventh
the
transparent
excuse
of
sympathy
for
the
old
man
and
her
desire
to
save
him
from
the
consequences
of
his
crime
which
she
offered
in
extenuation
of
her
own
criminal
avowal
of
having
first
found
and
then
reburied
the
gains
she
had
come
upon
in
her
persistent
pursuit
of
the
flying
criminal
so
impulsive
an
act
might
be
consistent
with
the
blind
compassion
of
some
but
woman
but
not
with
her
nature
incapable
of
performing
any
heroic
deed
save
from
personal
motives
or
the
most
headlong
passion
lastly
the
weakness
of
her
explanation
in
regard
to
the
cause
which
led
her
to
peer
into
the
zabel
cottage
through
a
hole
made
in
the
curiosity
has
its
limits
even
in
a
woman
breast
and
unless
she
hoped
to
see
more
than
was
indicated
by
her
words
her
action
was
but
the
precursor
of
a
personal
entrance
into
a
room
where
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
the
bill
was
left
a
telling
record
and
sufficient
to
favour
the
theory
of
her
personal
guilt
if
after
due
thought
certain
facts
in
contradiction
to
this
assumption
had
not
offered
themselves
to
his
mind
even
before
he
thought
of
frederick
as
the
unknown
man
she
had
followed
down
the
hillside
as
for
instance
this
crime
if
committed
by
her
was
done
deliberately
and
with
a
premeditation
antedating
her
departure
from
the
ballroom
yet
she
went
upon
this
errand
in
slippers
white
slippers
at
that
something
which
so
cool
and
calculating
a
woman
would
have
avoided
however
careless
she
might
have
shown
herself
in
other
regards
again
guilt
awakens
cunning
even
in
the
dullest
breast
but
she
keen
beyond
most
men
even
and
so
that
the
most
searching
examination
could
not
shake
her
betrayed
an
utter
carelessness
as
to
what
she
did
with
these
slippers
on
her
return
thrusting
them
into
a
place
easily
accessible
to
the
most
casual
search
had
she
been
conscious
of
guilt
and
thus
amenable
to
law
the
sight
of
blood
and
on
those
slippers
would
have
appalled
her
and
she
would
have
made
some
attempt
to
destroy
them
and
not
put
them
behind
a
picture
and
forgotten
them
again
would
she
have
been
so
careless
with
a
flower
she
knew
to
be
identified
with
herself
a
woman
who
deliberately
involves
herself
in
crime
has
quick
eyes
she
would
have
seen
that
flower
fall
at
all
events
if
she
had
been
immediately
responsible
for
its
being
on
the
scene
of
crime
she
would
with
her
quick
wit
have
found
some
excuse
or
explanation
for
it
instead
of
defying
her
examiners
with
some
such
words
as
these
it
is
a
fact
for
you
to
explain
i
only
know
that
i
did
not
carry
this
flower
into
that
room
of
death
again
had
she
been
actuated
in
her
attempt
to
fix
the
crime
on
old
james
zabel
by
a
personal
consciousness
of
guilt
and
a
personal
dread
she
would
not
have
stopped
at
suggestion
in
her
allusions
to
the
person
she
watched
burying
the
treasure
in
the
woods
instead
of
speaking
of
him
as
a
shadow
whose
flight
she
had
followed
at
a
distance
she
would
have
described
his
figure
as
that
of
the
same
old
man
she
had
seen
enter
the
zabel
cottage
a
few
minutes
before
there
being
no
reason
for
indefiniteness
on
this
point
her
conscience
being
sufficiently
elastic
for
any
falsehood
that
would
further
her
ends
and
lastly
her
manner
under
the
examination
to
which
she
had
been
subjected
was
not
that
of
one
who
felt
herself
under
a
personal
attack
it
was
a
strange
suggestive
hesitating
manner
baffling
alike
to
him
who
had
more
or
less
sounded
her
strange
nature
and
to
those
who
had
no
previous
knowledge
of
her
freaks
and
subtle
intellectual
power
and
only
reaching
its
height
of
hateful
charm
and
mysterious
daring
when
frederick
appeared
on
the
scene
and
joined
or
seemed
to
join
himself
to
the
number
of
her
examiners
now
let
all
suspicion
of
her
as
an
active
agent
in
this
crime
be
dropped
assume
frederick
to
be
the
culprit
and
she
the
simple
accessory
after
the
fact
and
see
how
inconsistencies
vanish
and
how
much
more
natural
the
whole
conduct
of
this
mysterious
woman
appears
amabel
page
left
a
merry
dance
at
midnight
and
stole
away
into
the
sutherland
garden
in
her
party
dress
and
slippers
why
not
to
fulfil
an
errand
which
anyone
who
knows
her
cold
and
unsympathetic
nature
can
but
regard
as
a
pretext
but
because
she
felt
it
imperative
to
see
if
her
lover
with
whose
character
temptations
and
necessities
she
was
fully
acquainted
and
in
whose
excited
and
preoccupied
manner
she
had
probably
discovered
signs
of
a
secretly
growing
purpose
meant
indeed
to
elude
his
guests
and
slip
away
to
town
on
the
dangerous
and
unholy
enterprise
suggested
by
their
mutual
knowledge
of
the
money
to
be
obtained
there
by
one
daring
enough
to
enter
a
certain
house
open
like
their
own
to
midnight
visitors
she
followed
at
such
an
hour
and
into
such
a
place
not
an
unknown
man
casually
come
upon
but
her
lover
whom
she
had
tracked
from
the
garden
of
his
father
house
where
she
had
lain
in
wait
for
him
it
took
courage
to
do
this
but
a
courage
no
longer
beyond
the
limit
of
feminine
daring
for
her
fate
was
bound
up
in
his
and
she
could
not
but
feel
the
impulse
to
save
him
from
the
consequences
of
crime
if
not
from
the
crime
itself
as
for
the
aforementioned
flower
what
more
natural
than
that
frederick
should
have
transferred
it
from
her
hair
to
his
buttonhole
during
some
of
their
interviews
at
the
ball
and
that
it
should
have
fallen
from
its
place
to
the
floor
in
the
midst
of
his
possible
struggle
with
batsy
and
with
this
assumption
of
her
perfect
knowledge
as
to
who
the
man
was
who
had
entered
webb
house
how
much
easier
it
is
to
understand
why
she
did
not
lift
her
head
when
she
heard
him
descend
the
stairs
no
woman
even
one
so
depraved
as
she
would
wish
to
see
the
handsome
face
of
her
lover
in
the
glare
of
a
freshly
committed
crime
and
besides
she
might
very
easily
be
afraid
of
him
for
a
man
has
but
a
blow
for
the
suddenly
detected
witness
of
his
crime
unless
that
witness
is
his
confidant
which
from
every
indication
sweetwater
felt
bound
to
believe
amabel
was
not
her
flight
to
the
zabel
cottage
after
an
experience
which
would
madden
most
women
can
now
be
understood
she
was
still
following
her
lover
the
plan
of
making
agatha
old
and
wretched
friend
amenable
for
her
death
originated
with
frederick
and
not
with
amabel
it
was
he
who
first
started
for
the
zabel
cottage
it
was
he
who
left
the
bank
bill
there
this
is
all
clear
and
even
the
one
contradictory
fact
of
the
dagger
having
been
seen
in
the
old
man
hand
was
not
a
to
sweetwater
with
the
audacity
of
one
confident
of
his
own
insight
he
explained
it
to
himself
thus
the
dagger
thrown
from
the
window
by
the
assassin
possibly
because
he
knew
of
zabel
expected
visit
there
that
night
fell
on
the
grass
and
was
picked
up
by
amabel
only
to
be
flung
down
again
in
the
brightest
part
of
the
lawn
it
was
lying
there
then
when
a
few
minutes
later
and
before
either
frederick
or
amabel
had
left
the
house
the
old
man
entered
the
yard
in
a
state
of
misery
bordering
on
frenzy
he
and
his
brother
were
starving
had
been
starving
for
days
he
was
too
proud
to
own
his
want
and
too
loyal
to
his
brother
to
leave
him
for
the
sake
of
the
food
prepared
for
them
both
at
agatha
house
and
this
was
why
he
had
hesitated
over
his
duty
till
this
late
hour
when
his
own
secret
misery
or
perhaps
the
hope
of
relieving
his
brother
drove
him
to
enter
the
gate
he
had
been
accustomed
to
see
open
before
him
in
glad
hospitality
he
finds
the
lights
burning
in
the
house
above
and
below
and
encouraged
by
the
welcome
they
seem
to
hold
out
he
staggers
up
the
path
ignorant
of
the
tragedy
which
was
at
that
very
moment
being
enacted
behind
those
lighted
windows
but
toward
the
house
he
stops
the
courage
which
has
brought
him
so
far
suddenly
fails
and
in
one
of
those
quick
visions
which
sometimes
visit
men
in
extremity
he
foresees
the
astonishment
which
his
emaciated
figure
is
likely
to
cause
in
these
two
old
friends
and
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
he
stops
and
bitterly
communes
with
himself
before
venturing
farther
fatal
stop
fatal
communing
for
as
he
stands
there
he
sees
a
dagger
his
own
old
dagger
how
lost
or
how
found
he
probably
did
not
stop
to
ask
lying
on
the
grass
and
offering
in
its
dumb
way
suggestions
as
to
how
he
might
end
this
struggle
without
any
further
suffering
dizzy
with
the
new
hope
preferring
death
to
the
humiliation
he
saw
before
him
in
agatha
cottage
he
dashes
out
of
the
yard
almost
upsetting
crane
who
was
passing
by
on
his
homeward
way
from
an
errand
of
mercy
a
little
while
later
amabel
comes
upon
him
lying
across
his
own
doorstep
he
has
made
an
effort
to
enter
but
his
long
walk
and
the
excitement
of
this
last
bitter
hour
have
been
too
much
for
him
as
she
watches
him
he
gains
strength
and
struggles
to
his
feet
while
she
aghast
at
the
sight
of
the
dagger
she
had
herself
flung
down
in
yard
and
dreading
the
encounter
between
this
old
man
and
the
lover
she
had
been
following
to
this
place
creeps
around
the
house
and
looks
into
the
first
window
she
finds
open
what
does
she
expect
to
see
frederick
brought
face
to
face
with
this
desperate
figure
with
its
uplifted
knife
but
instead
of
that
she
beholds
another
old
man
seated
at
a
table
and
amabel
had
paused
when
she
reached
that
and
and
sweetwater
had
not
then
seen
how
important
this
pause
was
but
now
he
understood
it
now
he
saw
that
if
she
had
not
had
a
subtle
purpose
in
view
that
if
she
had
wished
to
tell
the
truth
rather
than
produce
false
inferences
in
the
minds
of
those
about
her
calculated
to
save
the
criminal
as
she
called
him
she
would
have
completed
her
sentence
thus
i
saw
an
old
man
seated
at
a
table
and
frederick
sutherland
standing
over
him
for
sweetwater
had
no
longer
a
doubt
that
frederick
was
in
that
room
at
that
moment
what
further
she
saw
whether
she
was
witness
to
an
encounter
between
this
intruder
and
james
or
whether
by
some
lingering
on
the
latter
part
frederick
was
able
to
leave
the
house
without
running
across
him
was
a
matter
of
comparative
unimportance
what
is
of
importance
is
that
he
did
leave
it
and
that
amabel
knowing
it
was
frederick
strove
to
make
her
auditors
believe
it
was
zabel
who
carried
the
remainder
of
the
money
into
the
woods
yet
she
did
not
say
so
and
if
her
words
on
this
subject
could
be
carefully
recalled
one
would
see
that
it
was
still
her
lover
she
was
following
and
no
old
man
tottering
on
the
verge
of
the
grave
and
only
surviving
because
of
the
task
he
was
bent
on
performing
amabel
excuse
for
handling
the
treasure
and
for
her
reburial
of
the
same
comes
now
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
she
hoped
to
share
this
money
some
day
and
her
greed
was
too
great
for
her
to
let
such
an
amount
lie
there
untouched
while
her
caution
led
her
to
bury
it
deeper
even
at
the
risk
of
the
discovery
she
was
too
inexperienced
to
fear
that
she
should
forget
to
feign
surprise
when
the
alarm
of
murder
was
raised
was
very
natural
and
so
was
the
fact
that
a
woman
with
a
soul
so
blunted
to
all
delicate
instincts
and
with
a
mind
so
intent
upon
perfecting
the
scheme
entered
into
by
the
murderer
of
throwing
the
blame
upon
the
man
whose
dagger
had
been
made
use
of
should
persist
in
visiting
the
scene
of
crime
and
calling
attention
to
the
spot
where
that
dagger
had
fallen
and
so
with
her
manner
before
her
examiners
baffling
as
that
manner
was
it
still
showed
streaks
of
consistency
when
you
thought
of
it
as
the
cloak
of
a
subtle
unprincipled
woman
who
sees
amongst
her
interlocutors
the
guilty
man
whom
by
a
word
she
can
destroy
but
whom
she
exerts
herself
to
save
even
at
the
cost
of
a
series
of
bizarre
explanations
she
was
playing
with
a
life
a
life
she
loved
but
not
with
sincerity
sufficient
to
rob
the
game
of
a
certain
delicate
if
inconceivable
intellectual
enjoyment
footnote
that
sweetwater
in
his
hate
and
with
no
real
clew
to
the
real
situation
should
come
so
near
the
truth
as
in
this
last
supposition
shows
the
keenness
of
his
insight
and
frederick
had
there
been
anything
in
his
former
life
or
in
his
conduct
since
the
murder
to
give
the
lie
to
these
heavy
doubts
against
him
on
the
contrary
though
sweetwater
knew
little
of
the
dark
record
which
had
made
this
young
man
the
disgrace
of
his
family
what
he
did
know
was
so
much
against
him
that
he
could
well
see
that
the
distance
usually
existing
between
simple
dissipation
and
desperate
crime
might
be
easily
bridged
by
some
great
necessity
for
money
had
there
been
such
a
necessity
sweetwater
found
it
easy
to
believe
so
and
manner
was
it
that
of
an
honest
man
simply
shocked
by
the
suspicions
which
had
fallen
upon
the
woman
he
loved
had
he
sweetwater
not
observed
certain
telltale
moments
in
his
late
behaviour
that
required
a
deeper
explanation
even
than
this
the
cry
for
instance
with
which
he
had
rushed
from
the
empty
ballroom
into
the
woods
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
was
it
a
natural
cry
or
an
easily
explainable
one
thank
god
this
terrible
night
is
over
strange
language
to
be
uttered
by
this
man
at
such
a
time
and
in
such
a
place
if
he
did
not
already
know
what
was
to
make
this
night
of
nights
memorable
through
all
this
region
he
did
know
and
this
cry
which
had
struck
sweetwater
strangely
at
the
time
and
still
more
strangely
when
he
regarded
it
simply
as
a
coincidence
now
took
on
all
the
force
of
a
revelation
and
the
irresistible
bubbling
up
in
frederick
breast
of
that
remorse
which
had
just
found
its
full
expression
on
agatha
grave
to
some
that
remorse
and
all
his
other
signs
of
suffering
might
be
explained
by
his
passion
for
the
real
criminal
but
to
sweetwater
it
was
only
too
evident
that
an
egotist
like
frederick
sutherland
can
not
suffer
for
another
to
such
an
extent
as
this
and
that
a
personal
explanation
must
be
given
for
so
personal
a
grief
even
if
that
explanation
involves
the
dreadful
charge
of
murder
it
was
when
sweetwater
reached
this
point
in
his
reasoning
that
frederick
disappeared
beneath
halliday
porch
and
sutherland
came
up
behind
him
after
the
short
conversation
in
which
sweetwater
saw
his
own
doubts
more
than
reflected
in
the
uneasy
consciousness
of
this
stricken
father
he
went
home
and
the
struggle
of
his
life
began
xxii
sweetwater
acts
sweetwater
had
promised
sutherland
that
he
would
keep
counsel
in
regard
to
his
present
convictions
concerning
frederick
guilt
but
this
he
knew
he
could
not
do
if
he
remained
in
sutherlandtown
and
fell
under
the
pitiless
examination
of
courtney
the
shrewd
and
able
prosecuting
attorney
of
the
district
he
was
too
young
too
honest
and
had
made
himself
too
conspicuous
in
this
affair
to
succeed
in
an
undertaking
requiring
so
much
dissimulation
if
not
actual
falsehood
indeed
he
was
not
sure
that
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
could
hear
frederick
name
mentioned
without
flushing
and
slight
as
such
a
hint
might
be
it
would
be
enough
to
direct
attention
to
frederick
which
once
done
could
but
lead
to
discovery
and
permanent
disgrace
to
all
who
bore
the
name
of
sutherland
what
was
he
to
do
then
how
avoid
a
consequence
he
found
himself
absolutely
unable
to
face
it
was
a
problem
which
this
night
must
solve
for
him
but
how
as
i
have
said
he
went
down
to
his
house
to
think
sweetwater
was
not
a
man
of
absolute
rectitude
he
was
not
so
much
as
he
had
besides
certain
foibles
in
the
first
place
he
was
vain
and
vanity
in
a
very
plain
man
is
all
the
more
acute
since
it
centres
in
his
capabilities
rather
than
in
his
appearance
had
sweetwater
been
handsome
or
even
passably
attractive
he
might
have
been
satisfied
with
the
approbation
of
demure
maidens
and
a
comradeship
with
his
fellows
but
being
one
who
could
hope
for
nothing
of
this
kind
not
even
for
a
decent
return
to
the
unreasoning
he
felt
himself
capable
of
paying
and
which
he
had
once
paid
for
a
few
short
days
till
warned
of
his
presumption
by
the
insolence
of
the
recipient
he
had
fixed
his
hope
and
his
ambition
on
doing
something
which
would
rouse
the
admiration
of
those
about
him
and
bring
him
into
that
prominence
to
which
he
felt
himself
entitled
that
he
a
skilful
musician
should
desire
to
be
known
as
a
brilliant
detective
is
only
one
of
the
anomalies
of
human
nature
which
it
would
be
folly
and
a
waste
of
time
on
our
part
to
endeavour
to
explain
that
having
chosen
to
exercise
his
wits
in
this
way
he
should
so
well
succeed
that
he
dared
not
for
his
life
continue
in
the
work
he
had
so
publicly
undertaken
occasioned
in
him
a
pang
of
disappointment
almost
as
insufferable
as
that
brought
by
the
realisation
of
what
his
efforts
were
likely
to
bring
upon
the
man
to
whose
benevolence
he
owed
his
very
life
hence
his
struggle
which
must
be
measured
by
the
extent
of
his
desires
and
the
limitations
which
had
been
set
to
his
nature
by
his
surroundings
and
the
circumstances
of
his
life
and
daily
history
if
we
enter
with
him
into
the
humble
cottage
where
he
was
born
and
from
which
he
had
hardly
strayed
more
than
a
dozen
miles
in
the
years
of
his
circumscribed
life
we
may
be
able
to
understand
him
better
it
was
an
unpainted
house
perched
on
an
arid
hillside
with
nothing
before
it
but
the
limitless
sea
he
had
found
his
way
to
it
mechanically
but
as
he
approached
the
narrow
doorway
he
paused
and
turned
his
face
towards
the
stretch
of
heaving
waters
whose
low
or
loud
booming
had
been
first
his
cradle
song
and
then
the
ceaseless
accompaniment
of
his
later
thoughts
and
aspirations
it
was
heaving
yet
ceaselessly
heaving
and
in
its
loud
complaint
there
was
a
sound
of
moaning
not
always
to
be
found
there
or
so
it
seemed
to
sweetwater
in
his
present
troubled
mood
sighing
as
this
sound
reached
his
ear
and
shuddering
as
its
meaning
touched
his
heart
sweetwater
pushed
open
the
door
of
his
small
house
and
entered
it
is
i
mamsie
he
shouted
in
what
he
meant
to
be
his
usual
voice
but
to
a
sensitive
ear
and
what
ear
is
so
sensitive
as
a
mother
there
was
a
tremble
in
it
that
was
not
wholly
natural
is
anything
the
matter
dear
called
out
that
mother
in
reply
the
question
made
him
start
though
he
replied
quickly
enough
and
in
more
guarded
tones
no
mamsie
go
to
sleep
i
tired
that
all
would
to
god
that
was
all
he
recalled
with
envy
the
days
when
he
dragged
himself
into
the
house
at
sundown
after
twelve
long
hours
of
work
on
the
docks
as
he
paused
in
the
dark
hallway
and
listened
till
he
heard
the
breathing
of
her
who
had
called
him
dear
the
only
one
in
the
world
who
ever
had
or
ever
would
call
him
dear
he
had
glimpses
of
that
old
self
which
made
him
question
if
his
on
the
violin
and
the
restless
ambition
which
had
driven
him
out
of
the
ways
of
his
ancestors
into
strange
attempts
for
which
he
was
not
prepared
by
any
previous
discipline
had
brought
him
happiness
or
improved
his
manhood
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
the
sleep
of
those
nights
of
his
busy
boyhood
was
sweeter
than
the
wakefulness
of
these
later
days
and
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
and
infinitely
better
for
her
if
he
had
remained
at
the
carpenter
bench
and
been
satisfied
with
a
repetition
of
his
father
existence
his
mother
was
the
only
person
sharing
that
small
house
with
him
and
once
assured
that
she
was
asleep
he
lighted
a
lamp
in
the
empty
kitchen
and
sat
down
it
was
just
twelve
this
to
anyone
accustomed
to
this
peculiar
young
man
habits
had
nothing
unusual
in
it
he
was
accustomed
to
come
home
late
and
sit
thus
by
himself
for
a
short
time
before
going
but
to
one
capable
of
reading
his
sharp
and
none
too
mobile
countenance
there
was
a
change
in
the
character
of
the
brooding
into
which
he
now
sank
which
had
that
mother
been
awake
to
watch
him
would
have
made
every
turn
of
his
eye
and
movement
of
his
hand
interesting
and
important
in
the
first
place
the
careless
attitude
into
which
he
had
fallen
was
totally
at
variance
with
the
restless
glance
which
took
in
every
object
in
that
room
so
associated
with
his
mother
and
her
daily
work
that
he
could
not
imagine
her
in
any
other
surroundings
and
wondered
sometimes
if
she
would
seem
any
longer
his
mother
if
transplanted
to
other
scenes
and
engaged
in
other
tasks
little
things
petty
objects
of
household
use
or
ornament
which
he
had
seen
all
his
life
without
specially
noticing
them
seemed
under
the
stress
of
his
present
mood
to
acquire
a
sudden
importance
and
fix
themselves
indelibly
in
his
memory
there
on
a
nail
driven
long
before
he
was
born
hung
the
little
round
he
had
pieced
together
in
his
earliest
years
and
presented
to
his
mother
in
a
gush
of
pride
greater
than
any
he
had
since
experienced
she
had
never
used
it
but
it
always
hung
upon
the
one
nail
in
the
one
place
as
a
symbol
of
his
love
and
of
hers
and
there
higher
up
on
the
end
of
the
shelf
barren
enough
of
ornaments
god
wot
were
a
broken
toy
and
a
primer
mementos
likewise
of
his
childhood
and
farther
along
the
wall
on
a
sort
of
raised
bench
a
keg
the
spigot
of
which
he
was
once
guilty
of
turning
on
in
his
infantile
longing
for
sweets
only
to
find
he
could
not
turn
it
back
again
until
all
the
floor
was
covered
with
molasses
and
his
appetite
for
the
forbidden
gratified
to
the
full
and
yonder
dangling
from
a
peg
never
devoted
to
any
other
use
hung
his
old
hat
just
where
he
had
placed
it
on
the
fatal
morning
when
he
came
in
and
lay
down
on
the
lounge
for
the
last
time
and
close
to
it
lovingly
close
to
it
sweetwater
thought
his
mother
apron
the
apron
he
had
seen
her
wear
at
supper
and
which
he
would
see
her
wear
at
breakfast
with
all
its
suggestions
of
ceaseless
work
and
patient
thrift
somehow
he
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
that
apron
with
the
expectation
now
forming
in
his
mind
of
leaving
this
home
and
leaving
this
mother
this
symbol
of
humble
toil
became
an
intolerable
grief
to
him
jumping
up
he
turned
in
another
direction
but
now
another
group
of
objects
equally
eloquent
came
under
his
eye
it
was
his
mother
he
saw
with
a
piece
of
sewing
in
it
intended
for
him
and
as
if
this
were
not
enough
the
table
set
for
two
and
at
his
place
a
little
covered
dish
which
held
the
one
sweetmeat
he
craved
for
breakfast
the
spectacles
lying
beside
her
plate
told
him
how
old
she
was
and
as
he
thought
of
her
failing
strength
and
enfeebled
ways
he
jumped
up
again
and
sought
another
corner
but
here
his
glances
fell
on
his
violin
and
a
new
series
of
emotions
awakened
within
him
he
loved
the
instrument
and
played
as
much
from
natural
intuition
as
acquired
knowledge
but
in
the
plan
of
action
he
had
laid
out
for
himself
his
violin
could
have
no
part
he
would
have
to
leave
it
behind
feeling
that
his
regrets
were
fast
becoming
too
much
for
him
he
left
the
humble
kitchen
and
went
but
not
to
sleep
locking
the
door
something
he
never
remembered
doing
before
in
all
his
life
he
began
to
handle
over
his
clothes
and
other
trivial
belongings
choosing
out
a
certain
strong
suit
he
laid
it
out
on
the
bed
and
then
went
to
a
bureau
drawer
and
drew
out
an
wallet
this
he
opened
but
after
he
had
counted
the
few
bills
it
contained
he
shook
his
head
and
put
them
all
back
only
retaining
a
little
silver
which
he
slipped
into
one
of
the
pockets
of
the
suit
he
had
chosen
then
he
searched
for
and
found
a
little
bible
which
his
mother
had
once
given
him
he
was
about
to
thrust
that
into
another
pocket
but
he
seemed
to
think
better
of
this
too
for
he
ended
by
putting
it
back
into
the
drawer
and
taking
instead
a
bit
from
one
of
his
mother
old
aprons
which
he
had
chanced
upon
on
the
stairway
this
he
placed
as
carefully
in
his
watch
pocket
as
if
it
had
been
the
picture
of
a
girl
he
loved
then
he
undressed
and
went
to
bed
sweetwater
said
afterwards
that
she
never
knew
caleb
to
talk
so
much
and
eat
so
little
as
he
did
that
next
morning
at
breakfast
such
plans
as
he
detailed
for
unmasking
the
murderer
of
webb
such
business
for
the
day
so
many
people
to
see
it
made
her
quite
dizzy
she
said
and
indeed
sweetwater
was
more
than
usually
voluble
that
morning
perhaps
because
he
could
not
bear
his
mother
satisfied
smile
and
when
he
went
out
of
the
house
it
was
with
a
laugh
and
a
cheery
mamsie
that
was
in
spiking
contrast
to
the
irrepressible
exclamation
of
grief
which
escaped
him
when
the
door
was
closed
between
them
ah
when
should
he
enter
those
four
walls
again
and
when
should
he
see
the
old
mother
he
proceeded
immediately
to
town
a
ship
was
preparing
to
sail
that
morning
for
the
brazils
and
the
wharves
were
alive
with
bustle
he
stopped
a
moment
to
contemplate
the
great
hulk
rising
and
falling
at
her
moorings
then
he
passed
on
and
entered
the
building
where
he
had
every
reason
to
expect
to
find
talbot
and
knapp
in
discussion
it
was
very
important
to
him
that
morning
to
learn
just
how
they
felt
concerning
the
great
matter
absorbing
him
for
if
suspicion
was
taking
the
direction
of
frederick
or
if
he
saw
it
was
at
all
likely
to
do
so
then
would
his
struggle
be
cut
short
and
all
necessity
for
leaving
town
be
at
an
end
it
was
to
save
frederick
from
this
danger
that
he
was
prepared
to
cut
all
the
ties
binding
him
to
this
place
and
nothing
short
of
the
prospect
of
accomplishing
this
would
make
him
willing
to
undergo
such
a
sacrifice
well
sweetwater
any
news
eh
was
the
greeting
he
received
from
the
coroner
sweetwater
who
had
regained
entire
control
over
his
feelings
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
under
the
eye
of
this
man
and
the
supercilious
detective
he
had
attempted
to
rival
gave
a
careless
shrug
and
passed
the
question
on
to
knapp
have
you
any
news
he
asked
knapp
who
would
probably
not
have
acknowledged
it
if
he
had
smiled
the
indulgent
smile
of
a
superior
and
uttered
a
few
equivocal
sentences
this
was
gall
and
wormwood
to
sweetwater
but
he
kept
his
temper
admirably
and
with
an
air
of
bravado
entirely
assumed
for
the
occasion
said
to
talbot
i
think
i
shall
have
something
to
tell
you
soon
which
will
materially
aid
you
in
your
search
for
witnesses
by
at
least
i
shall
know
whether
i
am
right
or
wrong
in
thinking
i
have
discovered
an
important
witness
in
quite
an
unexpected
quarter
sweetwater
knew
of
no
new
witness
but
it
was
necessary
for
him
not
only
to
have
a
pretext
for
the
move
he
contemplated
but
to
so
impress
these
men
with
an
idea
of
his
extreme
interest
in
the
approaching
proceedings
that
no
suspicion
should
ever
arise
of
his
having
premeditated
an
escape
from
them
he
wished
to
appear
the
victim
of
accident
and
this
is
why
he
took
nothing
from
his
home
which
would
betray
any
intention
of
leaving
it
ha
indeed
ejaculated
the
coroner
with
growing
interest
and
may
i
ask
please
urged
sweetwater
with
a
side
look
at
knapp
do
not
ask
me
anything
just
yet
this
afternoon
say
after
i
have
had
a
certain
interview
with
what
are
they
setting
sails
on
the
hesper
already
he
burst
out
with
a
quick
glance
from
the
window
at
the
great
ship
riding
at
anchor
a
little
distance
from
them
in
the
harbour
there
is
a
man
on
her
i
must
see
excuse
me
oh
mr
sutherland
he
fell
back
in
confusion
that
gentleman
had
just
entered
the
room
in
company
with
frederick
xxiii
a
sinister
pair
i
beg
your
pardon
stammered
sweetwater
starting
aside
and
losing
on
the
instant
all
further
disposition
to
leave
the
room
indeed
he
had
not
the
courage
to
do
so
even
if
he
had
had
the
will
the
joint
appearance
of
these
two
men
in
this
place
and
at
an
hour
so
far
in
advance
of
that
which
usually
saw
sutherland
enter
the
town
was
far
too
significant
in
his
eyes
for
him
to
ignore
it
had
any
explanation
taken
place
between
them
and
had
sutherland
integrity
triumphed
over
personal
considerations
to
the
point
of
his
bringing
frederick
here
to
confess
meanwhile
talbot
had
risen
with
a
full
and
hearty
greeting
which
proved
to
sweetwater
uneasy
mind
that
notwithstanding
disquieting
reticence
no
direct
suspicion
had
as
yet
fallen
on
the
unhappy
frederick
then
he
waited
for
what
sutherland
had
to
say
for
it
was
evident
he
had
come
there
to
say
something
sweetwater
waited
too
frozen
almost
into
immobility
by
the
fear
that
it
would
be
something
injudicious
for
never
had
he
seen
any
man
so
changed
as
sutherland
in
these
last
twelve
hours
nor
did
it
need
a
highly
penetrating
eye
to
detect
that
the
relations
between
him
and
frederick
were
strained
to
a
point
that
made
it
almost
impossible
for
them
to
more
than
assume
their
old
confidential
attitude
knapp
knowing
them
but
superficially
did
not
perceive
this
but
talbot
was
not
blind
to
it
as
was
shown
by
the
inquiring
look
he
directed
towards
them
both
while
waiting
sutherland
spoke
at
last
pardon
me
for
interrupting
you
so
early
said
he
with
a
certain
tremble
in
his
voice
which
sweetwater
quaked
to
hear
for
certain
reasons
i
should
be
very
glad
to
know
we
should
be
very
glad
to
know
if
during
your
investigations
into
the
cause
and
manner
of
agatha
death
you
have
come
upon
a
copy
of
her
will
no
talbot
was
at
once
interested
so
was
knapp
while
sweetwater
withdrew
further
into
his
corner
in
anxious
endeavour
to
hide
his
blanching
cheek
we
have
found
nothing
we
do
not
even
know
that
she
has
made
a
will
i
ask
pursued
sutherland
with
a
slight
glance
toward
frederick
who
seemed
at
least
in
sweetwater
judgment
to
have
braced
himself
up
to
bear
this
interview
unmoved
because
i
have
not
only
received
intimation
that
she
made
such
a
will
but
have
even
been
entrusted
with
a
copy
of
it
as
chief
executor
of
the
same
it
came
to
me
in
a
letter
from
boston
yesterday
its
contents
were
a
surprise
to
me
frederick
hand
me
a
chair
these
accumulated
misfortunes
for
we
all
suffer
under
the
afflictions
which
have
beset
this
town
have
made
me
feel
my
years
sweetwater
drew
his
breath
more
freely
he
thought
he
might
understand
by
this
last
sentence
that
sutherland
had
come
here
for
a
different
cause
than
he
had
at
first
feared
frederick
on
the
contrary
betrayed
a
failing
ability
to
hide
his
emotion
he
brought
his
father
a
chair
placed
it
and
was
drawing
back
out
of
sight
when
sutherland
prevented
him
by
a
mild
command
to
hand
the
paper
he
had
brought
to
the
coroner
there
was
something
in
his
manner
that
made
sweetwater
lean
forward
and
frederick
look
up
so
that
the
father
and
son
eyes
met
under
that
young
man
scrutiny
but
while
he
saw
meaning
in
both
their
regards
there
was
nothing
like
collusion
and
baffled
by
these
appearances
which
while
interesting
told
him
little
or
nothing
he
transferred
his
attention
to
talbot
and
knapp
who
had
drawn
together
to
see
what
this
paper
contained
as
i
have
said
the
contents
of
this
will
are
a
surprise
to
me
faltered
sutherland
they
are
equally
so
to
my
son
he
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
been
a
friend
even
of
the
extraordinary
woman
who
thus
leaves
him
her
whole
fortune
i
never
spoke
with
her
but
twice
exclaimed
frederick
with
a
studied
coldness
which
was
so
evidently
the
cloak
of
inner
agitation
that
sweetwater
trembled
for
its
effect
notwithstanding
the
state
of
his
own
thoughts
which
were
in
a
ferment
frederick
the
inheritor
of
agatha
webb
fortune
frederick
concerning
whom
his
father
had
said
on
the
previous
night
that
he
possessed
no
motive
for
wishing
this
good
death
was
it
the
discovery
that
such
a
motive
existed
which
had
so
aged
this
man
in
the
last
twelve
hours
sweetwater
dared
not
turn
again
to
see
his
own
face
might
convey
too
much
of
his
own
fears
doubts
and
struggle
but
the
coroner
for
whose
next
words
sweetwater
listened
with
acute
expectancy
seemed
to
be
moved
simply
by
the
unexpectedness
of
the
occurrence
glancing
at
frederick
with
more
interest
than
he
had
ever
before
shown
him
he
cried
with
a
certain
show
of
enthusiasm
a
pretty
fortune
a
very
pretty
fortune
then
with
a
deprecatory
air
natural
to
him
in
addressing
sutherland
would
it
be
indiscreet
for
me
to
ask
to
what
our
dear
friend
agatha
alludes
in
her
reference
to
your
late
lamented
wife
his
finger
was
on
a
clause
of
the
will
and
his
lips
next
minute
mechanically
repeated
what
he
was
pointing
at
remembrance
of
services
rendered
me
in
early
life
by
marietta
sutherland
wife
of
charles
sutherland
of
sutherlandtown
i
bequeath
to
frederick
sole
child
of
her
affection
all
the
property
real
and
personal
of
which
i
die
possessed
services
rendered
they
must
have
been
very
important
ones
suggested
talbot
sutherland
expression
was
one
of
entire
perplexity
and
doubt
i
do
not
remember
my
wife
ever
speaking
of
any
special
act
of
kindness
she
was
enabled
to
show
agatha
webb
they
were
always
friends
but
never
intimate
ones
however
agatha
could
be
trusted
to
make
no
mistake
she
doubtless
knew
to
what
she
referred
sutherland
was
fully
capable
of
doing
an
extremely
kind
act
in
secret
for
all
his
respect
for
the
speaker
talbot
did
not
seem
quite
satisfied
he
glanced
at
frederick
and
fumbled
the
paper
uneasily
perhaps
you
were
acquainted
with
the
reason
for
this
legacy
this
large
legacy
he
emphasised
frederick
thus
called
upon
nay
forced
to
speak
raised
his
head
and
without
perhaps
bestowing
so
much
as
a
thought
on
the
young
man
behind
him
who
was
inwardly
quivering
in
anxious
expectancy
of
some
betrayal
on
his
part
which
would
precipitate
disgrace
and
lifelong
sorrow
on
all
who
bore
the
name
of
sutherland
met
talbot
inquiring
glance
with
a
simple
earnestness
surprising
to
them
all
and
said
my
record
is
so
much
against
me
that
i
am
not
surprised
that
you
wonder
at
my
being
left
with
webb
fortune
perhaps
she
did
not
fully
realise
the
lack
of
estimation
in
which
i
am
deservedly
held
in
this
place
or
perhaps
and
this
would
be
much
more
like
her
she
hoped
that
the
responsibility
of
owing
my
independence
to
so
good
and
so
unfortunate
a
woman
might
make
a
man
of
me
there
was
a
manliness
in
frederick
words
and
bearing
that
took
them
all
by
surprise
sutherland
dejection
visibly
lightened
while
sweetwater
conscious
of
the
more
than
vital
interests
hanging
upon
the
impression
which
might
be
made
by
this
event
upon
the
minds
of
the
men
present
turned
slightly
so
as
to
bring
their
faces
into
the
line
of
his
vision
the
result
was
a
conviction
that
as
yet
no
real
suspicion
of
frederick
had
seized
upon
either
of
their
minds
knapp
face
was
perfectly
calm
and
almost
indifferent
while
the
good
coroner
who
saw
this
and
every
other
circumstance
connected
with
this
affair
through
the
one
medium
of
his
belief
in
amabel
guilt
was
surveying
frederick
with
something
like
sympathy
i
fear
said
he
that
others
were
not
as
ignorant
of
your
prospective
good
fortune
as
you
were
yourself
at
which
frederick
cheek
turned
a
dark
red
though
he
said
nothing
and
sweetwater
with
a
sudden
involuntary
gesture
indicative
of
resolve
gazed
for
a
moment
breathlessly
at
the
ship
and
then
with
an
unexpected
and
highly
impetuous
movement
dashed
from
the
room
crying
loudly
i
seen
him
i
seen
him
he
just
going
on
board
the
ship
wait
for
me
talbot
i
be
back
in
fifteen
minutes
with
such
a
witness
here
the
door
slammed
but
they
could
hear
his
hurrying
footsteps
as
he
plunged
down
the
stairs
and
rushed
away
from
the
building
it
was
an
unexpected
termination
to
an
interview
fast
becoming
unbearable
to
the
two
sutherlands
but
no
one
not
even
the
old
gentleman
himself
took
in
its
full
significance
he
was
however
more
than
agitated
by
the
occurrence
and
could
hardly
prevent
himself
from
repeating
aloud
sweetwater
final
word
which
after
their
interview
at
halliday
gate
the
night
before
seemed
to
convey
to
him
at
once
a
warning
and
a
threat
to
keep
himself
from
what
he
feared
might
prove
a
he
faltered
out
in
very
evident
dismay
what
is
the
matter
what
has
come
over
the
lad
oh
cried
talbot
he
been
watching
that
ship
for
an
hour
he
is
after
some
man
he
has
just
seen
go
aboard
her
says
he
a
new
and
important
witness
in
this
case
perhaps
he
is
sweetwater
is
no
fool
for
all
his
small
eyes
and
retreating
chin
if
you
want
proof
of
it
wait
till
he
comes
back
he
be
sure
to
have
something
to
say
meanwhile
they
had
all
pressed
forward
to
the
window
frederick
who
carefully
kept
his
face
out
of
his
father
view
bent
over
the
sill
in
his
anxiety
to
watch
the
flying
figure
of
sweetwater
who
was
making
straight
for
the
dock
while
knapp
roused
at
last
leaned
over
his
shoulder
and
pointed
to
the
sailors
on
the
deck
who
were
pulling
in
the
last
ropes
preparatory
to
sailing
he
too
late
they
wo
let
him
aboard
now
what
a
fool
to
hang
around
here
till
he
saw
his
man
instead
of
being
at
the
dock
to
nab
him
that
comes
of
trusting
a
country
bumpkin
i
knew
he
fail
us
at
the
pinch
they
lack
training
these
detectives
see
now
run
up
against
the
mate
and
the
mate
pushes
him
back
his
cake
is
all
dough
unless
he
got
a
warrant
has
he
a
warrant
dr
talbot
no
said
the
coroner
he
did
ask
for
one
he
did
even
tell
me
whom
he
wanted
can
it
be
one
of
those
two
passengers
you
see
on
the
forward
deck
there
it
might
well
be
even
from
a
distance
these
two
men
presented
a
sinister
appearance
that
made
them
quite
marked
figures
among
the
crowd
of
hurrying
sailors
and
belated
passengers
one
of
them
is
peering
over
the
rail
with
a
very
evident
air
of
anxiety
his
eye
is
on
sweetwater
who
is
dancing
with
impatience
see
he
is
gesticulating
like
a
monkey
and
by
the
powers
they
are
going
to
let
him
go
aboard
sutherland
who
had
been
leaning
heavily
against
the
in
the
agitation
of
doubt
and
suspense
which
sweetwater
unaccountable
conduct
had
evoked
here
crossed
to
the
other
side
and
stole
a
determined
look
at
frederick
was
his
son
personally
interested
in
this
attempt
of
the
amateur
detective
did
he
know
whom
sweetwater
sought
and
was
he
suffering
as
much
or
more
than
himself
from
the
uncertainty
and
fearful
possibilities
of
the
moment
he
thought
he
knew
face
and
that
he
read
dread
there
but
frederick
had
changed
so
completely
since
the
commission
of
this
crime
that
even
his
father
could
no
longer
be
sure
of
the
correct
meaning
either
of
his
words
or
expression
the
torture
of
the
moment
continued
he
climbs
like
a
squirrel
remarked
talbot
with
a
touch
of
enthusiasm
look
at
him
now
he
on
the
quarterdeck
and
will
be
down
in
the
cabins
before
you
can
say
jack
robinson
i
warrant
they
have
told
him
to
hurry
captain
dunlap
is
the
man
to
wait
five
minutes
after
the
ropes
are
pulled
in
those
two
men
have
shrunk
away
behind
some
mast
or
other
cried
knapp
they
are
the
fellows
he
after
but
what
can
they
have
to
do
with
the
murder
have
you
ever
seen
them
here
about
town
dr
talbot
not
that
i
remember
they
have
a
foreign
air
about
them
look
like
south
americans
well
they
going
to
south
america
sweetwater
ca
stop
them
he
has
barely
time
to
get
off
the
ship
himself
there
goes
the
last
rope
have
they
forgotten
him
they
drawing
up
the
ladder
no
the
mate
stops
them
see
he
calling
the
fellow
i
can
hear
his
voice
ca
you
sweetwater
game
is
up
he
have
to
leave
in
a
hurry
what
the
rumpus
now
nothing
only
they
scattered
to
look
for
him
the
fox
is
down
in
the
cabins
and
wo
come
up
laughing
in
his
sleeve
no
doubt
at
keeping
the
vessel
waiting
while
he
hunts
up
his
witness
if
it
one
of
those
two
men
he
laying
a
trap
for
he
wo
snare
him
in
a
hurry
they
sneaks
those
two
and
why
the
sailors
are
coming
back
shaking
their
heads
i
can
almost
hear
from
here
the
oaths
and
such
a
favourable
wind
for
getting
out
of
the
harbour
sweetwater
my
boy
you
are
distinguishing
yourself
if
your
witness
do
pan
out
well
you
wo
hear
the
last
of
this
in
a
hurry
it
looks
as
if
they
meant
to
sail
without
waiting
to
put
him
ashore
observed
frederick
in
a
low
tone
too
carefully
modulated
not
to
strike
his
father
as
unnatural
by
jingoes
so
it
does
ejaculated
knapp
there
go
the
sails
the
pilot
hand
is
on
the
wheel
and
talbot
are
you
going
to
let
your
cunning
amateur
detective
and
his
important
witness
slip
away
from
you
like
this
i
can
not
help
myself
said
the
coroner
a
little
dazed
himself
at
this
unexpected
chance
my
voice
would
reach
them
from
this
place
besides
they
would
heed
me
if
it
did
the
ship
is
already
under
way
and
we
wo
see
sweetwater
again
till
the
pilot
boat
comes
back
sutherland
moved
from
the
window
and
crossed
to
the
door
like
a
man
in
a
dream
frederick
instantly
conscious
of
his
departure
turned
to
follow
him
but
presently
stopped
and
addressing
knapp
for
the
first
time
observed
quietly
this
is
all
very
exciting
but
i
think
your
estimate
of
this
fellow
sweetwater
is
just
he
a
busybody
and
craves
notoriety
above
everything
he
had
no
witness
on
board
or
if
he
had
it
was
an
imaginary
one
you
will
see
him
return
quite
crestfallen
before
night
with
some
excuse
of
mistaken
identity
the
shrug
which
knapp
gave
dismissed
sweetwater
as
completely
from
the
affair
as
if
he
had
never
been
in
it
i
think
i
may
now
regard
myself
as
having
this
matter
in
my
sole
charge
was
his
curt
remark
as
he
turned
away
while
frederick
with
a
respectful
bow
to
talbot
remarked
in
leaving
i
am
at
your
service
talbot
if
you
require
me
to
testify
at
the
inquest
in
regard
to
this
will
my
testimony
can
all
be
concentrated
into
the
one
sentence
did
not
expect
this
bequest
and
have
no
theories
to
advance
in
explanation
of
it
but
it
has
made
me
feel
myself
webb
debtor
and
given
me
a
justifiable
interest
in
the
inquiry
which
i
am
told
you
open
into
the
cause
and
manner
of
her
death
if
there
is
a
guilty
person
in
this
case
i
shall
raise
no
barrier
in
the
way
of
his
conviction
and
while
the
coroner
face
still
showed
the
embarrassment
which
this
last
sentence
called
up
his
mind
being
now
as
ever
fixed
on
amabel
frederick
offered
his
arm
to
his
father
whose
condition
was
not
improved
by
the
excitements
of
the
last
and
proceeded
to
lead
him
from
the
building
whatever
they
thought
or
however
each
strove
to
hide
their
conclusions
from
the
other
no
words
passed
between
them
till
they
came
in
full
sight
of
the
sea
on
a
distant
billow
of
which
the
bound
for
the
brazils
rode
triumphantly
on
its
outward
course
then
sutherland
remarked
with
a
suggestive
glance
at
the
vessel
the
young
man
who
has
found
an
unexpected
passage
on
that
vessel
will
not
come
back
with
the
pilot
was
the
sigh
which
was
frederick
only
answer
one
of
relief
it
certainly
seemed
so
xxiv
in
the
shadow
op
the
mast
sutherland
was
right
sweetwater
did
not
return
with
the
pilot
according
to
the
latter
there
was
no
sweetwater
on
board
the
ship
to
return
at
all
events
the
minutest
search
had
not
succeeded
in
finding
him
in
the
cabins
though
no
one
had
seen
him
leave
the
vessel
or
indeed
seen
him
at
all
after
his
hasty
dash
below
decks
it
was
thought
on
board
that
he
had
succeeded
in
reaching
shore
before
the
ship
set
sail
and
the
pilot
was
suitably
surprised
at
learning
this
was
not
so
so
were
sweetwater
friends
and
associates
with
the
exception
of
a
certain
old
gentleman
living
on
the
hill
and
knapp
the
detective
he
that
is
the
latter
had
his
explanation
at
his
tongue
end
sweetwater
is
a
fakir
he
thought
he
could
carry
off
the
honours
from
the
regular
force
and
when
he
found
he
could
he
quietly
disappeared
we
shall
hear
of
him
again
in
the
brazils
an
opinion
that
speedily
gained
ground
so
that
in
a
few
hours
sweetwater
was
all
but
forgotten
save
by
his
mother
whose
heart
was
filled
with
suspense
and
by
sutherland
whose
breast
was
burdened
by
gratitude
the
amazing
fact
of
frederick
the
village
scapegrace
and
amabel
reckless
if
aristocratic
lover
having
been
made
the
legatee
of
the
upright
webb
secret
savings
had
something
to
do
with
this
with
such
a
topic
at
hand
not
only
the
gossips
but
those
who
had
the
matter
of
agatha
murder
in
hand
found
ample
material
to
occupy
their
thoughts
and
tongues
without
wasting
time
over
a
presumptuous
busybody
who
had
not
wits
enough
to
know
that
five
minutes
before
is
an
unfortunate
moment
in
which
to
enter
a
ship
and
where
was
sweetwater
that
he
could
not
be
found
on
the
shore
or
on
the
ship
we
will
follow
him
and
see
accustomed
from
his
youth
to
ramble
over
the
vessels
while
in
port
he
knew
this
one
as
well
as
he
did
his
mother
house
it
was
therefore
a
surprise
to
the
sailors
when
shortly
after
the
departure
of
the
pilot
they
came
upon
him
lying
in
the
hold
half
buried
under
a
box
which
had
partially
fallen
upon
him
he
was
unconscious
or
appeared
to
be
so
and
when
brought
into
open
light
showed
marks
of
physical
distress
and
injury
but
his
eye
was
clear
and
his
expression
hardly
as
rueful
as
one
would
expect
in
a
man
who
finds
himself
en
route
for
the
brazils
with
barely
a
couple
of
dollars
in
his
pocket
and
every
prospect
of
being
obliged
to
work
before
the
mast
to
earn
his
passage
even
the
captain
noticed
this
and
eyed
him
with
suspicion
but
sweetwater
rousing
to
the
necessities
of
the
occasion
forthwith
showed
such
a
mixture
of
discouragement
and
perplexity
that
the
honest
sailor
was
deceived
and
abated
half
at
least
of
his
oaths
he
gave
sweetwater
a
hammock
and
admitted
him
to
the
mess
but
told
him
that
as
soon
as
his
bruises
allowed
him
to
work
he
should
show
himself
on
deck
or
expect
the
rough
treatment
commonly
bestowed
on
stowaways
it
was
a
prospect
to
daunt
some
men
but
not
sweetwater
indeed
it
was
no
more
than
he
had
calculated
upon
when
he
left
his
savings
behind
with
his
old
mother
and
entered
upon
this
enterprise
with
only
a
little
change
in
his
pocket
he
had
undertaken
out
of
love
and
gratitude
to
sutherland
to
rid
frederick
of
a
dangerous
witness
and
he
felt
able
to
complete
the
sacrifice
more
than
that
he
was
even
strangely
happy
for
a
time
the
elation
of
the
willing
victim
was
his
that
is
for
a
few
short
hours
then
he
began
to
think
of
his
mother
how
had
she
borne
his
sudden
departure
what
would
she
think
had
befallen
him
and
how
long
would
he
have
to
wait
before
he
could
send
her
word
of
his
safety
if
he
was
to
be
of
real
service
to
the
man
he
venerated
he
must
be
lost
long
enough
for
the
public
mind
to
have
become
settled
in
regard
to
the
mysteries
of
the
webb
murder
and
for
his
own
boastful
connection
with
it
to
be
forgotten
this
might
mean
years
of
exile
he
rather
thought
it
did
meanwhile
his
mother
of
himself
he
thought
little
by
sundown
he
felt
himself
sufficiently
recovered
from
his
bruises
to
go
up
on
deck
it
was
a
mild
night
and
the
sea
was
running
in
smooth
long
waves
that
as
yet
but
faintly
presaged
the
storm
brewing
on
the
distant
horizon
as
he
inhaled
the
fresh
air
the
joy
of
renewed
health
began
to
infuse
its
life
into
his
veins
and
lift
the
oppression
from
his
heart
and
glad
of
a
few
minutes
of
quiet
enjoyment
he
withdrew
to
a
solitary
portion
of
the
deck
and
allowed
himself
to
forget
his
troubles
in
contemplation
of
the
rapidly
deepening
sky
and
boundless
stretch
of
waters
but
such
griefs
and
anxieties
as
weighed
upon
this
man
breast
are
not
so
easily
shaken
off
before
he
realised
it
his
thoughts
had
recurred
to
the
old
theme
and
he
was
wondering
if
he
was
really
of
sufficient
insignificance
in
the
eyes
of
his
not
to
be
sought
for
and
found
in
that
distant
country
to
which
he
was
bound
would
they
in
spite
of
his
precautions
suspect
that
he
had
planned
this
evasion
and
insist
on
his
return
or
would
he
be
allowed
to
slip
away
and
drop
out
of
sight
like
the
white
froth
he
was
watching
on
the
top
of
the
waves
he
had
boasted
of
possessing
a
witness
would
they
believe
that
boast
and
send
a
detective
in
search
of
him
or
would
they
take
his
words
for
the
bombast
they
really
were
and
proceed
with
their
investigations
in
happy
relief
at
the
loss
of
his
intrusive
assistance
as
this
was
a
question
impossible
for
him
to
answer
he
turned
to
other
thoughts
and
fretted
himself
for
a
while
with
memories
of
disdain
and
frederick
careless
acceptance
of
a
sacrifice
he
could
never
know
the
cost
of
mixed
strangely
with
relief
at
being
free
of
it
all
and
on
the
verge
of
another
life
as
the
dark
settled
his
head
fell
farther
and
farther
forward
on
the
rail
he
was
leaning
against
till
he
became
to
any
passing
eye
but
a
blurred
shadow
mixing
with
other
shadows
equally
immovable
unlike
them
however
his
shadow
suddenly
shifted
two
men
had
drawn
near
him
one
speaking
pure
spanish
and
the
other
english
the
english
was
all
that
sweetwater
could
understand
and
this
half
of
the
conversation
was
certainly
startling
enough
though
he
could
not
of
coarse
know
to
what
or
whom
it
referred
and
though
it
certainly
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
or
any
interest
he
represented
or
understood
he
could
not
help
listening
and
remembering
every
word
the
man
uttered
the
first
sentence
he
comprehended
it
was
this
shall
it
be
the
answer
was
in
spanish
again
the
english
voice
he
has
come
up
i
saw
him
distinctly
as
he
passed
the
second
mast
more
spanish
then
english
you
may
if
you
want
to
but
i
never
breathe
easy
while
he
on
the
ship
are
you
sure
he
the
fellow
we
fear
a
rapid
flow
of
words
from
which
sweetwater
got
nothing
then
slowly
and
distinctly
in
the
sinister
tones
he
had
already
begun
to
shiver
at
very
good
the
should
pay
well
for
this
with
the
quick
addition
following
a
hurried
whisper
all
right
i
send
a
dozen
men
to
the
bottom
for
half
that
money
but
there
here
a
fellow
watching
us
if
he
has
heard
sweetwater
turned
saw
two
desperate
faces
projected
toward
him
realised
that
something
awful
unheard
of
was
about
to
happen
and
would
have
uttered
a
yell
of
dismay
but
that
the
very
intensity
of
his
fright
took
away
his
breath
the
next
minute
he
felt
himself
launched
into
space
and
enveloped
in
the
darkness
of
the
chilling
waters
he
had
been
lifted
bodily
and
flung
headlong
into
the
sea
xxv
in
extremity
sweetwater
one
thought
as
he
sank
was
now
sutherland
need
fear
me
no
longer
but
the
instinct
of
life
is
strong
in
every
heart
and
when
he
found
himself
breathing
the
air
again
he
threw
out
his
arms
wildly
and
grasped
a
spar
it
was
life
to
him
hope
reconnection
with
his
kind
he
clutched
clung
and
feeling
himself
floating
uttered
a
shout
of
mingled
joy
and
appeal
that
unhappily
was
smothered
in
the
noise
of
the
waters
and
the
now
rapidly
rising
wind
whence
had
come
this
spar
in
his
desperate
need
he
never
knew
but
somewhere
in
his
remote
consciousness
an
impression
remained
of
a
shock
to
the
waves
following
his
own
plunge
into
the
water
which
might
mean
that
this
spar
had
been
thrown
out
after
him
perhaps
by
the
already
repentant
hands
of
the
wretches
who
had
tossed
him
to
his
death
however
it
came
or
from
whatever
source
it
had
at
least
given
him
an
opportunity
to
measure
his
doom
and
realise
the
agonies
of
hope
when
it
alternates
with
despair
the
darkness
was
impenetrable
it
was
no
longer
that
of
heaven
but
of
the
nether
world
or
so
it
seemed
to
this
dazed
soul
plunged
suddenly
from
dreams
of
exile
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
and
such
a
death
as
he
realised
its
horrors
as
he
felt
the
chill
of
night
and
the
oncoming
storm
strike
its
piercing
fangs
into
his
marrow
and
knew
that
his
existence
and
the
hope
of
ever
again
seeing
the
dear
old
face
at
the
fireside
rested
upon
the
strength
of
his
will
and
the
tenacity
of
his
he
felt
his
heart
fail
and
the
breath
that
was
his
life
cease
in
a
gurgle
of
terror
but
he
clung
on
and
though
no
comfort
came
still
clung
while
vague
memories
of
shipwrecks
and
stories
told
in
his
youth
of
men
women
and
children
tossing
for
hours
on
a
drifting
plank
flashed
through
his
benumbed
brain
and
lent
their
horror
to
his
own
sensations
of
apprehension
and
despair
he
wanted
to
live
now
that
the
dread
spectre
had
risen
out
of
the
water
and
had
its
clutch
on
his
hair
he
realised
that
the
world
held
much
for
him
and
that
even
in
exile
he
might
work
and
love
and
enjoy
heaven
and
earth
the
green
fields
and
the
blue
sky
not
such
skies
as
were
above
him
now
no
this
was
not
sky
that
overarched
him
but
a
horrible
vault
in
which
the
clouds
rushing
in
torn
masses
had
the
aspect
of
demons
stooping
to
contend
for
him
with
those
other
demons
that
with
long
arms
and
irresistible
grip
were
dragging
at
him
from
below
he
was
alone
on
a
whirling
spar
in
the
midst
of
a
midnight
ocean
but
horror
and
a
pitiless
imagination
made
this
conflict
more
than
that
of
the
elements
and
his
position
an
isolation
beyond
that
of
man
removed
from
his
fellows
he
was
almost
mad
yet
he
clung
suddenly
a
better
frame
of
mind
prevailed
the
sky
was
no
lighter
save
as
the
lightning
came
to
relieve
the
overwhelming
darkness
by
a
still
more
overwhelming
glare
nor
were
the
waves
less
importunate
or
his
hold
on
the
spar
more
secure
but
the
horror
seemed
to
have
lifted
and
the
practical
nature
of
the
man
reasserted
itself
other
men
had
gone
through
worse
dangers
than
these
and
survived
to
tell
the
tale
as
he
might
survive
to
tell
his
the
will
was
all
will
and
an
indomitable
courage
and
he
had
will
and
he
had
courage
or
why
had
he
left
his
home
to
dare
a
hard
and
threatening
future
purely
from
a
sentiment
of
gratitude
could
he
hold
on
long
enough
daylight
would
come
and
if
as
he
now
thought
possible
he
had
been
thrown
into
the
sea
within
twenty
hours
after
leaving
sutherlandtown
then
he
must
be
not
far
from
cape
cod
and
in
the
direct
line
of
travel
from
new
york
to
boston
rescue
would
come
and
if
the
storm
which
was
breaking
over
his
head
more
and
more
furiously
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
retain
his
hold
it
certainly
would
not
wreck
his
spar
or
drench
him
more
than
he
was
already
drenched
while
every
blast
would
drive
him
shoreward
the
clinging
was
all
and
filial
love
would
make
him
do
that
even
in
the
which
now
and
then
swept
over
him
only
would
it
not
be
better
for
sutherland
if
he
should
fail
and
drop
away
into
the
yawning
chasms
of
the
unknown
world
beneath
there
were
moments
when
he
thought
so
and
then
his
clutch
perceptibly
weakened
but
only
once
did
he
come
near
losing
his
hold
altogether
and
that
was
when
he
thought
he
heard
a
laugh
a
laugh
here
in
the
midst
of
ocean
in
the
midst
of
storm
a
laugh
were
demons
a
reality
then
yes
but
the
demon
he
had
heard
was
of
his
own
imagination
it
had
a
face
of
medusa
sweetness
and
the
laugh
only
amabel
rang
out
so
thrillingly
false
and
with
such
diabolic
triumph
amabel
who
might
be
laughing
in
her
dreams
at
this
very
moment
of
his
supreme
misery
and
who
assuredly
would
laugh
if
conscious
of
his
suffering
and
aware
of
the
doom
to
which
his
had
brought
him
amabel
the
thought
of
her
made
the
night
more
dark
the
waters
more
threatening
the
future
less
promising
yet
he
would
hold
on
if
only
to
spite
her
who
hated
him
and
whom
he
hated
almost
as
much
as
he
loved
sutherland
it
was
his
last
conscious
thought
for
hours
when
morning
broke
he
was
but
a
nerveless
figure
with
sense
enough
to
cling
and
that
was
all
xxvi
the
adventure
of
the
parcel
a
man
haul
him
in
do
leave
a
poor
fellow
drifting
about
like
that
the
speaker
a
bluff
hearty
skipper
whose
sturdy
craft
had
outridden
one
of
the
worst
storms
of
the
season
pointed
to
our
poor
friend
sweetwater
whose
head
could
just
be
seen
above
the
broken
spar
he
clung
to
in
another
moment
a
hands
were
stretched
for
him
and
the
insensible
form
was
drawn
in
and
laid
on
a
deck
which
still
showed
the
results
of
the
night
fierce
conflict
with
the
waters
damn
it
how
ugly
he
is
cried
one
of
the
sailors
with
a
leer
at
the
man
face
i
like
to
see
the
lass
we
please
in
saving
him
he
only
fit
to
poison
a
but
though
more
than
one
laugh
rang
out
they
gave
him
good
care
and
when
sweetwater
came
to
life
and
realised
that
his
blood
was
pulsing
warmly
again
through
his
veins
and
that
a
grey
sky
had
taken
the
place
of
darkness
and
a
sound
board
supported
limbs
which
for
hours
had
yielded
helplessly
to
the
rocking
billows
he
saw
a
ring
of
hard
but
faces
about
him
and
realised
quite
well
what
had
been
done
for
him
when
one
of
them
said
there
he
do
now
all
hands
on
deck
we
can
get
into
new
bedford
in
two
days
if
this
wind
holds
nor
west
shouted
the
skipper
to
the
man
at
the
tiller
we
sup
with
our
old
women
in
hours
new
bedford
it
was
the
only
word
sweetwater
heard
so
he
was
no
farther
away
from
sutherlandtown
than
that
evidently
providence
had
not
meant
him
to
escape
or
was
it
his
fortitude
that
was
being
tried
a
man
as
humble
as
he
might
easily
be
lost
even
in
a
place
as
small
as
new
bedford
it
was
his
identity
he
must
suppress
with
that
unrecognised
he
might
remain
in
the
next
village
to
sutherlandtown
without
fear
of
being
called
up
as
a
witness
against
frederick
but
could
he
suppress
it
he
thought
he
could
at
all
events
he
meant
to
try
what
your
name
were
the
words
he
now
heard
shouted
in
his
ear
jonathan
briggs
was
his
mumbled
reply
i
was
blown
off
a
ship
deck
in
the
gale
last
night
what
ship
the
proserpine
it
was
the
first
name
that
suggested
itself
to
him
oh
i
thought
it
might
have
been
the
hesper
she
foundered
off
here
last
night
foundered
the
hesper
the
hot
blood
was
shooting
now
through
his
veins
yes
we
just
picked
up
her
that
was
before
we
got
a
hold
on
you
foundered
the
ship
from
which
he
had
been
so
mercilessly
thrown
and
all
on
board
lost
perhaps
he
began
to
realise
the
hand
of
providence
in
his
fate
it
was
the
hesper
i
sailed
on
i
not
just
clear
yet
in
my
head
my
first
voyage
was
made
on
the
proserpine
well
bless
the
gale
that
blew
me
from
that
deck
he
seemed
incoherent
and
they
left
him
again
for
a
little
while
when
they
came
back
he
had
his
story
all
ready
which
imposed
upon
them
just
so
far
as
it
was
for
their
interest
their
business
on
this
coast
was
not
precisely
legitimate
and
when
they
found
he
simply
wanted
to
be
set
on
shore
they
were
quite
willing
to
do
thus
much
for
him
only
they
regretted
that
he
had
barely
two
dollars
and
his
own
soaked
clothing
to
give
in
exchange
for
the
motley
garments
they
trumped
up
among
them
for
his
present
comfort
but
he
as
well
as
they
made
the
best
of
a
bad
bargain
he
especially
as
his
clothes
which
would
be
soon
scattered
among
half
a
dozen
families
were
the
only
remaining
clew
connecting
him
with
his
native
town
he
could
now
be
jonathan
briggs
indeed
only
who
was
jonathan
briggs
and
how
was
he
to
earn
a
living
under
these
unexpected
conditions
at
the
end
of
a
couple
of
days
he
was
dexterously
landed
on
the
end
of
a
long
pier
which
they
passed
without
stopping
on
their
way
to
their
own
obscure
anchorage
as
he
jumped
from
the
rail
to
the
pier
and
felt
again
the
touch
of
terra
firma
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
uncontrollable
elation
yet
he
had
not
a
cent
in
the
world
no
friends
and
certainly
no
prospects
he
did
not
even
know
whether
to
turn
to
the
right
or
the
left
as
he
stepped
out
upon
the
docks
and
when
he
had
decided
to
turn
to
the
right
as
being
on
the
whole
more
lucky
he
did
not
know
whether
to
risk
his
fortune
in
the
streets
of
the
town
or
to
plunge
into
one
of
the
drinking
houses
whose
signs
confronted
him
on
this
he
decided
that
his
prospects
for
a
dinner
were
slim
in
any
case
and
that
his
only
hope
of
breaking
fast
that
day
lay
in
the
use
he
might
make
of
one
of
his
three
talents
either
he
must
find
a
fiddle
to
play
on
a
carpenter
bench
to
work
at
or
a
piece
of
detective
shadowing
to
do
the
last
would
bring
him
before
the
notice
of
the
police
which
was
just
the
thing
he
must
avoid
so
it
was
fiddling
or
carpentry
he
must
seek
either
of
which
would
be
difficult
to
obtain
in
his
present
garb
but
of
difficulties
sweetwater
was
not
a
man
to
take
note
he
had
undertaken
out
of
pure
love
for
a
good
man
to
lose
himself
he
had
accomplished
this
and
now
was
he
to
complain
because
in
doing
so
he
was
likely
to
go
hungry
for
a
day
or
two
no
amabel
might
laugh
at
him
or
he
might
fancy
she
did
while
struggling
in
the
midst
of
rapidly
engulfing
waters
but
would
she
laugh
at
him
now
he
did
not
think
she
would
she
was
of
the
kind
who
sometimes
go
hungry
themselves
in
old
age
some
premonition
of
this
might
give
her
a
fellow
feeling
he
came
to
a
stand
before
a
little
child
sitting
on
an
doorstep
smiling
at
her
kindly
he
waited
for
her
first
expression
to
see
how
he
appeared
in
the
eyes
of
innocence
not
so
bad
a
man
it
seemed
though
his
naturally
plain
countenance
was
not
relieved
by
the
seaman
cap
and
knitted
shirt
he
wore
for
she
laughed
as
she
looked
at
him
and
only
ran
away
because
there
was
room
for
him
to
pass
beside
her
comforted
a
little
he
sauntered
on
glancing
here
and
there
with
that
sharp
eye
of
his
for
a
piece
of
work
to
be
done
suddenly
he
came
to
a
halt
a
had
got
into
an
altercation
with
an
oysterman
and
her
stall
had
been
upset
in
the
contention
and
her
vegetables
were
rolling
here
and
there
he
righted
her
stall
picked
up
her
vegetables
and
in
return
got
two
apples
and
a
red
herring
he
would
not
have
given
to
a
dog
at
home
yet
it
was
the
sweetest
morsel
he
had
ever
tasted
and
the
apples
might
have
been
grown
in
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
from
the
satisfaction
and
pleasure
they
gave
this
hungry
man
then
refreshed
he
dashed
into
the
town
it
should
now
go
hard
but
he
would
earn
a
night
lodging
the
day
was
windy
and
he
was
going
along
a
narrow
street
when
something
floated
down
from
a
window
above
past
his
head
it
was
a
woman
veil
and
as
he
looked
up
to
see
where
it
came
from
he
met
the
eyes
of
its
owner
looking
down
from
an
open
casement
above
him
she
was
gesticulating
and
seemed
to
point
to
someone
up
the
street
glad
to
seize
at
anything
which
promised
emolument
or
adventure
he
shouted
up
and
asked
her
what
she
wanted
that
man
down
there
she
cried
the
one
in
a
long
black
coat
going
up
the
street
keep
after
him
and
stop
him
tell
him
the
telegram
has
come
quick
quick
before
he
gets
around
the
corner
he
will
pay
you
run
sweetwater
with
joy
in
his
heart
for
five
cents
was
a
boon
to
him
in
the
present
condition
of
his
affairs
rushed
after
the
man
she
had
pointed
out
and
hastily
stopped
him
someone
he
added
a
woman
in
a
window
back
there
bade
me
run
after
you
and
say
the
telegram
has
come
she
told
me
you
would
pay
me
he
added
for
he
saw
the
man
was
turning
hastily
back
without
thinking
of
the
messenger
i
need
the
money
and
the
run
was
a
sharp
one
with
a
preoccupied
air
the
man
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
pulled
out
a
coin
and
handed
it
to
him
then
he
walked
hurriedly
off
evidently
the
news
was
welcome
to
him
but
sweetwater
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
the
man
had
given
him
a
gold
piece
instead
of
the
nickel
he
had
evidently
intended
how
hungrily
sweetwater
eyed
that
coin
in
it
was
lodging
food
perhaps
a
new
article
or
so
of
clothing
but
after
a
moment
of
indecision
which
might
well
be
forgiven
him
he
followed
speedily
after
the
man
and
overtook
him
just
as
he
reached
the
house
from
which
the
woman
veil
had
floated
sir
pardon
me
but
you
gave
me
five
dollars
instead
of
five
cents
it
was
a
mistake
i
can
not
keep
the
money
the
man
who
was
not
just
the
sort
from
whom
kindness
would
be
expected
looked
at
the
money
in
sweetwater
palm
then
at
the
miserable
clothes
he
wore
he
had
got
that
mud
helping
the
poor
and
stared
hard
at
the
face
of
the
man
who
looked
so
needy
and
yet
returned
him
five
dollars
you
an
honest
fellow
he
declared
not
offering
to
take
back
the
gold
piece
then
with
a
quick
glance
up
at
the
window
would
you
like
to
earn
that
money
sweetwater
broke
out
into
a
smile
which
changed
his
whole
countenance
would
i
sir
the
man
eyed
him
for
another
minute
with
scrutinising
intensity
then
he
said
shortly
come
with
me
they
entered
the
house
went
up
a
flight
or
two
and
stopped
at
a
door
which
was
slightly
ajar
we
are
going
into
the
presence
of
a
lady
remarked
the
man
wait
here
until
i
call
you
sweetwater
waited
the
many
thoughts
going
through
his
mind
not
preventing
him
from
observing
all
that
passed
the
man
who
had
left
the
door
wide
open
approached
the
lady
who
was
awaiting
him
and
who
was
apparently
the
same
one
who
had
sent
sweetwater
on
his
errand
and
entered
into
a
low
but
animated
conversation
she
held
a
telegram
in
her
hand
which
she
showed
him
and
then
after
a
little
earnest
parley
and
a
number
of
pleading
looks
from
them
both
toward
the
waiting
sweetwater
she
disappeared
into
another
room
from
which
she
brought
a
parcel
neatly
done
up
which
she
handed
to
the
man
with
a
strange
gesture
another
hurried
exchange
of
words
and
a
meaning
look
which
did
not
escape
the
sharp
eye
of
the
watchful
messenger
and
the
man
turned
and
gave
the
parcel
into
hands
you
are
to
carry
this
said
he
to
the
town
hall
in
the
second
room
to
the
right
on
entering
you
will
see
a
table
surrounded
by
chairs
which
at
this
hour
ought
to
be
empty
at
the
head
of
the
table
you
will
find
an
on
the
table
directly
in
front
of
this
you
will
lay
this
packet
mark
you
directly
before
the
chair
and
not
too
far
from
the
edge
of
the
table
then
you
are
to
come
out
if
you
see
anyone
say
you
came
to
leave
some
papers
for
gifford
do
this
and
you
may
keep
the
five
dollars
and
welcome
sweetwater
hesitated
there
was
something
in
the
errand
or
in
the
manner
of
the
man
and
woman
that
he
did
not
like
do
potter
spoke
up
the
latter
with
an
impatient
look
at
her
watch
gifford
will
expect
those
papers
sweetwater
sensitive
fingers
closed
on
the
package
he
held
it
did
not
feel
like
papers
are
you
going
asked
the
man
sweetwater
looked
up
with
a
smile
large
pay
for
so
slight
a
commission
he
ventured
turning
the
packet
over
and
over
in
his
hand
but
then
you
will
execute
it
at
once
and
according
to
the
instructions
i
have
given
you
retorted
the
man
it
is
your
trustworthiness
i
pay
for
now
go
sweetwater
turned
to
go
after
all
it
was
probably
all
right
and
five
dollars
easily
earned
is
doubly
five
dollars
as
he
reached
the
staircase
he
stumbled
the
shoes
he
wore
did
not
fit
him
be
careful
there
shouted
the
woman
in
a
shrill
almost
frightened
voice
while
the
man
stumbled
back
into
the
room
in
a
haste
which
seemed
wholly
uncalled
for
if
you
let
the
packet
fall
you
will
do
injury
to
its
contents
go
softly
man
go
softly
yet
they
had
said
it
held
papers
troubled
yet
hardly
knowing
what
his
duty
was
sweetwater
hastened
down
the
stairs
and
took
his
way
up
the
street
the
town
hall
should
be
easy
to
find
indeed
he
thought
he
saw
it
in
the
distance
as
he
went
he
asked
himself
two
questions
could
he
fail
to
deliver
the
package
according
to
instructions
and
yet
earn
his
money
and
was
there
any
way
of
so
delivering
it
without
risk
to
the
recipient
or
dereliction
of
duty
to
the
man
who
had
intrusted
it
to
him
and
whose
money
he
wished
to
earn
to
the
first
question
his
conscience
at
once
answered
no
to
the
second
the
reply
came
more
slowly
and
before
fixing
his
mind
determinedly
upon
it
he
asked
himself
why
he
felt
that
this
was
no
ordinary
commission
he
could
answer
readily
enough
first
the
pay
was
too
large
arguing
that
either
the
packet
or
the
placing
of
the
packet
in
a
certain
position
on
gifford
table
was
of
uncommon
importance
to
this
man
or
this
woman
secondly
the
woman
though
plainly
and
inconspicuously
clad
had
the
face
of
a
more
than
ordinarily
unscrupulous
adventuress
while
her
companion
was
one
of
those
men
we
sometimes
meet
whose
first
look
puts
us
on
our
guard
and
whom
if
we
hope
nothing
from
him
we
instinctively
shun
third
they
did
not
look
like
inhabitants
of
the
house
and
rooms
in
which
he
found
them
nothing
beyond
the
necessary
articles
of
furniture
was
to
be
seen
there
not
a
trunk
not
an
article
of
clothing
nor
any
of
the
little
things
that
mark
a
woman
presence
in
a
spot
where
she
expects
to
spend
a
day
or
even
an
hour
consequently
they
were
transients
and
perhaps
already
in
the
act
of
flight
then
he
was
being
followed
of
this
he
felt
sure
he
had
followed
people
himself
and
something
in
his
own
sensations
assured
him
that
his
movements
were
under
surveillance
it
would
therefore
not
do
to
show
any
consciousness
of
this
and
he
went
on
directly
and
as
straight
to
his
goal
as
his
rather
limited
knowledge
of
the
streets
would
allow
he
was
determined
to
earn
this
money
and
to
earn
it
without
disadvantage
to
anyone
and
he
thought
he
saw
his
way
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
hall
he
hesitated
an
instant
an
officer
was
standing
in
the
doorway
it
would
be
easy
to
call
his
attention
to
the
packet
he
held
and
ask
him
to
keep
his
eye
on
it
but
this
might
involve
him
with
the
police
and
this
was
something
as
we
know
which
he
was
more
than
anxious
to
avoid
he
reverted
to
his
first
idea
mixing
with
the
crowd
just
now
hurrying
to
and
fro
through
the
long
corridors
he
reached
the
room
designated
and
found
it
as
he
had
been
warned
he
should
empty
approaching
the
table
he
laid
down
the
packet
just
as
he
had
been
directed
in
front
of
the
big
arm
chair
and
then
casting
a
hurried
look
towards
the
door
and
failing
to
find
anyone
watching
him
he
took
up
a
pencil
lying
and
scrawled
hastily
across
the
top
of
the
packet
the
word
suspicious
this
he
calculated
would
act
as
a
warning
to
gifford
in
case
there
was
anything
wrong
about
the
package
and
pass
as
a
joke
with
him
and
even
the
sender
if
there
was
not
and
satisfied
that
he
had
both
earned
his
money
and
done
justice
to
his
own
apprehensions
he
turned
to
retrace
his
steps
as
before
the
corridors
were
alive
with
hurrying
men
of
various
ages
and
appearance
but
only
two
attracted
his
notice
one
of
these
was
a
large
man
who
turned
into
the
room
from
which
he
had
just
emerged
and
the
other
a
short
fair
man
with
a
countenance
he
had
known
from
boyhood
stone
of
sutherlandtown
was
within
ten
paces
of
him
and
he
was
as
well
known
to
the
good
postmaster
as
the
postmaster
was
to
him
could
anyone
have
foreseen
such
a
chance
turning
his
back
with
a
slow
slouch
he
made
for
a
rear
door
he
saw
swinging
in
and
out
before
him
as
he
passed
through
he
cast
a
quick
look
behind
him
he
had
not
been
recognised
in
great
relief
he
rushed
on
knocking
against
a
man
standing
against
one
of
the
outside
pillars
halloo
shouted
this
man
sweetwater
stopped
there
was
a
tone
of
authority
in
the
voice
which
he
could
not
resist
xxvii
the
adventure
of
the
scrap
of
paper
and
the
three
words
what
are
you
trying
to
do
why
do
you
fall
over
a
man
like
that
are
you
drunk
sweetwater
drew
himself
up
made
a
sheepish
bow
and
muttered
pantingly
excuse
me
sir
i
in
a
hurry
i
a
messenger
the
man
who
was
not
in
a
hurry
seemed
disposed
to
keep
him
for
a
moment
he
had
caught
sight
of
sweetwater
eye
which
was
his
one
remarkable
feature
and
he
had
also
been
impressed
by
that
word
messenger
for
he
repeated
it
with
some
emphasis
a
messenger
eh
are
you
going
on
a
message
now
sweetwater
who
was
anxious
to
get
away
from
the
vicinity
of
stone
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
careless
denial
and
was
pushing
on
when
the
gentleman
again
detained
him
do
you
know
said
he
that
i
like
your
looks
you
are
not
a
beauty
but
you
look
like
a
fellow
who
if
he
promised
to
do
a
thing
would
do
it
and
do
it
mighty
well
too
sweetwater
could
not
restrain
a
certain
movement
of
pride
he
was
honest
and
he
knew
it
but
the
fact
had
not
always
been
so
openly
recognised
i
have
just
earned
five
dollars
by
doing
a
commission
for
a
man
said
he
with
a
straightforward
look
see
sir
it
was
honestly
earned
the
man
who
was
young
and
had
a
rather
dashing
but
inscrutable
physiognomy
glanced
at
the
coin
sweetwater
showed
him
and
betrayed
a
certain
disappointment
so
you
flush
said
he
do
want
another
job
oh
as
to
that
said
sweetwater
edging
slowly
down
the
street
always
ready
for
business
five
dollars
wo
last
forever
and
besides
i
in
need
of
new
togs
well
rather
retorted
the
other
carelessly
following
him
do
you
mind
going
up
to
boston
boston
another
jump
toward
home
no
said
sweetwater
hesitatingly
not
if
it
made
worth
my
while
do
you
want
your
message
delivered
at
once
that
is
this
evening
it
a
task
involving
patience
and
more
or
less
shrewd
judgment
have
you
these
qualities
my
friend
one
would
not
judge
it
from
your
clothes
my
clothes
laughed
sweetwater
life
was
growing
very
interesting
all
at
once
i
know
it
takes
patience
to
wear
them
and
as
for
any
lack
of
judgment
i
may
show
in
their
choice
i
should
just
like
to
say
i
did
not
choose
them
myself
sir
they
fell
to
me
as
a
sort
of
legacy
from
friends
you
see
what
i
do
in
that
way
if
you
give
me
the
chance
to
earn
an
extra
ten
ah
it
ten
dollars
you
want
well
come
in
here
and
have
a
drink
and
then
we
see
they
were
before
a
saloon
house
of
less
than
humble
pretensions
and
as
he
followed
the
young
gentleman
in
it
struck
him
that
it
was
himself
rather
than
his
and
airy
companion
who
would
be
expected
to
drink
here
but
he
made
no
remark
though
he
intended
to
surprise
the
man
by
his
temperance
now
look
here
said
the
young
gentleman
suddenly
seating
himself
at
a
dingy
table
in
a
very
dark
corner
and
motioning
sweetwater
to
do
the
same
i
been
looking
for
a
man
all
day
to
go
up
to
boston
for
me
and
i
think
you
do
you
know
boston
sweetwater
had
great
command
over
himself
but
he
flushed
slightly
at
this
question
though
it
was
so
dark
where
he
sat
with
this
man
that
it
made
very
little
difference
i
have
been
there
said
he
very
well
then
you
will
go
again
you
will
arrive
there
about
seven
you
will
go
the
rounds
of
some
places
whose
names
i
will
give
you
and
when
you
come
across
a
certain
gentleman
whom
i
will
describe
to
you
you
will
give
him
not
a
package
sweetwater
broke
out
with
a
certain
sort
of
dread
of
a
repetition
of
his
late
experience
no
this
slip
on
which
two
words
are
written
he
will
want
one
more
word
but
before
you
give
it
to
him
you
must
ask
for
your
ten
dollars
you
get
them
he
answered
in
response
to
a
glance
of
suspicion
from
sweetwater
sweetwater
was
convinced
that
he
had
got
hold
of
another
suspicious
job
it
made
him
a
little
serious
do
i
look
like
a
for
crooks
he
asked
himself
i
afraid
i
not
so
much
of
a
success
as
i
thought
myself
but
he
said
to
the
man
before
him
ten
dollars
is
small
pay
for
such
business
would
be
nearer
the
mark
very
well
he
will
give
you
dollars
i
forgot
that
ten
dollars
was
but
little
in
advance
of
your
expenses
if
i
find
him
and
he
is
in
funds
what
if
i
do
nothing
nothing
except
your
ticket
that
i
give
you
sweetwater
did
not
know
what
to
say
like
the
preceding
job
it
might
be
innocent
and
it
might
not
and
then
he
did
not
like
going
to
boston
where
he
was
liable
to
meet
more
than
one
who
knew
him
there
is
no
harm
in
the
business
observed
the
other
carelessly
pushing
a
glass
of
whiskey
which
had
just
been
served
him
toward
sweetwater
i
would
even
be
willing
to
do
it
myself
if
i
could
leave
new
bedford
but
i
ca
come
it
as
easy
as
crooking
your
elbow
just
now
you
said
it
was
growled
sweetwater
drinking
from
his
glass
but
no
matter
about
that
go
ahead
i
do
it
shall
i
have
to
buy
other
clothes
i
buy
a
new
pair
of
trousers
suggested
the
other
the
rest
you
can
get
in
boston
you
do
want
to
be
too
much
in
evidence
you
know
sweetwater
agreed
with
him
to
attract
attention
was
what
he
most
dreaded
when
does
the
train
start
he
asked
the
young
man
told
him
well
that
will
give
me
time
to
buy
what
i
want
now
what
are
your
instructions
the
young
man
gave
him
a
memorandum
containing
four
addresses
you
will
find
him
at
one
of
these
places
said
he
and
now
to
know
your
man
when
you
see
him
he
is
a
large
handsome
fellow
with
red
hair
and
a
moustache
like
the
devil
he
has
been
hurt
and
wears
his
left
hand
in
a
sling
but
he
can
play
cards
and
will
be
found
playing
cards
and
in
very
good
company
too
you
will
have
to
use
your
discretion
in
approaching
him
when
once
he
sees
this
bit
of
paper
all
will
be
easy
he
knows
what
these
two
words
mean
well
enough
and
the
third
one
the
one
that
is
worth
dollars
to
you
is
frederick
sweetwater
who
had
drunk
half
his
glass
started
so
at
this
word
which
was
always
humming
in
his
brain
that
he
knocked
over
his
tumbler
and
spilled
what
was
left
in
it
i
hope
i
wo
forget
that
word
he
remarked
in
a
careless
tone
intended
to
carry
off
his
momentary
show
of
feeling
if
you
do
then
do
expect
the
dollars
retorted
the
other
finishing
his
own
glass
but
not
offering
to
renew
sweetwater
sweetwater
laughed
said
he
thought
he
could
trust
his
memory
and
rose
in
a
he
was
at
the
depot
and
in
another
fifteen
minutes
speeding
out
of
new
bedford
on
his
way
to
boston
he
had
had
but
one
anxiety
that
stone
might
be
going
up
to
boston
too
but
once
relieved
of
this
apprehension
he
settled
back
and
for
the
first
time
in
twelve
hours
had
a
minute
in
which
to
ask
himself
who
he
was
and
what
he
was
about
adventure
had
followed
so
fast
upon
adventure
that
he
was
in
a
more
or
less
dazed
condition
and
felt
as
little
capable
of
connecting
event
with
event
as
if
he
had
been
asked
to
recall
the
changing
pictures
of
a
kaleidoscope
that
affair
of
the
packet
now
was
it
or
was
it
not
serious
and
would
he
ever
know
what
it
meant
or
how
it
turned
out
like
a
child
who
had
been
given
a
pebble
and
told
to
throw
it
over
the
wall
he
had
thrown
and
run
giving
a
shout
of
warning
it
is
true
but
not
knowing
nor
ever
likely
to
know
where
the
stone
had
fallen
or
what
it
was
meant
to
do
then
this
new
commission
on
which
he
was
bent
was
it
in
any
way
connected
with
the
other
or
merely
the
odd
result
of
his
being
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
moment
he
was
inclined
to
think
the
latter
and
yet
how
odd
it
was
that
one
doubtful
errand
should
be
followed
by
another
in
a
town
no
larger
than
new
bedford
forcing
him
from
scene
to
scene
till
he
found
himself
speeding
toward
the
city
he
least
desired
to
enter
and
from
which
he
had
the
most
to
fear
but
brooding
over
a
case
like
this
brings
small
comfort
he
felt
that
he
had
been
juggled
with
but
he
neither
knew
by
whose
hand
nor
in
what
cause
if
the
hand
was
that
of
providence
why
he
had
only
to
go
on
following
the
beck
of
the
moment
while
if
it
was
that
of
fate
the
very
uselessness
of
struggling
with
it
was
apparent
at
once
poor
reasoning
perhaps
but
no
other
offered
and
satisfied
that
whatever
came
his
intentions
were
above
question
he
settled
himself
at
last
for
a
nap
of
which
he
certainly
stood
in
good
need
when
he
awoke
he
was
in
boston
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
show
his
list
of
addresses
and
inquire
into
what
quarter
they
would
lead
him
to
his
surprise
he
found
it
to
be
the
fashionable
quarter
two
of
them
were
names
of
a
third
that
of
a
restaurant
and
the
fourth
that
of
a
private
house
on
commonwealth
avenue
heigho
and
he
was
dressed
like
a
tramp
or
nearly
so
queer
messenger
i
for
such
kind
of
work
thought
he
i
wonder
why
he
lighted
on
such
a
customer
he
must
have
had
his
reasons
i
wonder
if
he
wished
the
errand
to
fail
he
bore
himself
very
nonchalantly
at
the
depot
when
i
last
saw
him
his
face
and
attitude
were
those
of
a
totally
unconcerned
man
have
i
been
sent
on
a
chase
after
all
the
absurdity
of
this
conclusion
struck
him
however
as
he
reasoned
why
then
should
he
have
paid
my
fare
not
as
a
benefit
to
me
of
course
but
for
his
own
ends
whatever
they
might
be
let
us
see
then
what
those
ends
are
so
now
for
the
gentleman
of
the
red
hair
who
plays
cards
with
one
arm
in
a
sling
he
thought
that
he
might
get
entrance
into
the
easily
enough
he
possessed
a
certain
amount
of
insinuation
when
necessity
required
and
if
had
a
good
expression
which
in
unprejudiced
minds
defied
criticism
of
porters
and
doorkeepers
he
was
not
afraid
and
these
were
the
men
he
must
first
encounter
at
the
first
he
succeeded
easily
enough
in
getting
word
with
the
man
waiting
in
the
large
hall
and
before
many
minutes
learned
that
the
object
of
his
search
was
not
to
be
found
there
that
evening
he
also
learned
his
name
which
was
a
great
step
towards
the
success
of
his
embassy
it
was
wattles
captain
wattles
a
marked
man
evidently
even
in
this
exclusive
and
aristocratic
club
armed
with
this
new
knowledge
he
made
his
way
to
the
second
building
of
the
kind
and
boldly
demanded
speech
with
captain
wattles
but
captain
wattles
had
not
yet
arrived
and
he
went
out
again
this
time
to
look
him
up
at
the
restaurant
he
was
not
there
as
sweetwater
was
going
out
two
gentlemen
came
in
one
of
whom
said
to
the
other
in
passing
sick
do
you
say
i
thought
wattles
was
made
of
iron
so
he
was
returned
the
other
before
that
accident
to
his
arm
now
the
least
thing
upsets
him
he
down
at
haberstow
that
was
all
the
door
was
swung
to
between
them
sweetwater
had
received
his
clew
but
what
a
clew
haberstow
where
was
that
thinking
the
bold
course
the
best
one
he
the
restaurant
and
approached
the
gentlemen
he
had
just
seen
enter
i
heard
you
speak
the
name
of
captain
wattles
said
he
i
am
hunting
for
captain
wattles
can
you
tell
me
where
he
is
he
soon
saw
that
he
had
struck
the
wrong
men
for
information
they
not
only
refused
to
answer
him
but
treated
him
with
open
disdain
unwilling
to
lose
time
he
left
them
and
having
no
other
resource
hastened
to
the
last
place
mentioned
on
his
list
it
was
now
late
too
late
to
enter
a
private
house
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
this
house
was
lighted
up
and
a
carriage
stood
in
front
of
it
so
he
had
the
courage
to
run
up
the
steps
and
consult
the
large
visible
from
the
sidewalk
it
read
thus
haberstow
fortune
had
favoured
him
better
than
he
expected
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
decided
to
ring
the
bell
but
before
he
had
done
so
the
door
opened
and
an
old
gentleman
appeared
seeing
a
younger
man
out
the
latter
had
his
arm
in
a
sling
and
bore
himself
with
a
fierceness
that
made
his
appearance
somewhat
alarming
the
other
seemed
to
be
in
an
irate
state
of
mind
no
apologies
the
former
was
saying
i
do
mind
the
night
air
not
so
ill
as
that
when
i
myself
again
we
have
a
little
more
talk
my
compliments
to
your
daughter
sir
i
wish
you
a
very
good
evening
or
rather
night
the
old
gentleman
bowed
and
as
he
did
so
sweetwater
caught
a
glimpse
it
was
the
shortest
glimpse
in
the
world
of
a
sweet
face
beaming
from
a
doorway
far
down
the
hall
there
was
pain
in
it
and
a
yearning
anxiety
that
made
it
very
beautiful
then
it
vanished
and
the
old
gentleman
uttering
some
few
sarcastic
words
closed
the
door
and
sweetwater
found
himself
alone
and
in
darkness
the
kaleidoscope
had
been
given
another
turn
dashing
down
the
stoop
he
came
upon
the
gentleman
who
had
preceded
him
just
as
he
was
seating
himself
in
the
carriage
pardon
me
he
gasped
as
the
driver
caught
up
the
reins
you
have
forgotten
something
then
as
captain
wattles
looked
hastily
out
you
have
forgotten
me
the
oath
that
rang
out
from
under
that
twitching
red
moustache
was
something
to
startle
even
him
but
he
clung
to
the
carriage
window
and
presently
managed
to
say
a
messenger
sir
from
new
bedford
i
have
been
on
the
hunt
for
you
for
two
hours
it
wo
keep
sir
for
more
than
a
longer
where
shall
i
find
you
during
that
time
captain
wattles
on
whom
the
name
new
bedford
seemed
to
have
made
some
impression
pointed
up
at
the
coachman
box
with
a
growl
in
which
command
mingled
strangely
with
menace
then
he
threw
himself
back
evidently
the
captain
was
not
in
very
good
humour
sweetwater
taking
this
as
an
order
to
seat
himself
beside
the
driver
did
so
and
the
carriage
drove
off
it
went
at
a
rapid
pace
and
before
he
had
time
to
propound
more
than
a
question
or
two
to
the
coachman
it
stopped
before
a
large
in
a
brilliantly
lighted
street
captain
wattles
got
out
and
sweetwater
followed
him
the
former
who
seemed
to
have
forgotten
sweetwater
walked
past
him
and
entered
the
building
with
a
stride
and
swing
that
made
the
plain
lean
messenger
behind
him
feel
smaller
than
ever
indeed
he
had
never
felt
so
small
for
not
only
was
the
captain
a
man
of
superb
proportions
and
conspicuous
bearing
but
he
possessed
in
spite
of
his
fiery
hair
and
fierce
moustache
that
de
which
is
at
once
threatening
and
imposing
added
to
this
he
was
angry
and
so
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
that
he
would
be
very
apt
to
visit
punishment
of
no
light
character
upon
anyone
who
interfered
with
him
a
pleasing
prospect
for
sweetwater
who
however
kept
on
with
the
dogged
determination
of
his
character
up
the
first
flight
of
stairs
and
then
up
another
till
they
stopped
captain
wattles
first
and
afterwards
his
humble
follower
before
a
small
door
into
which
the
captain
endeavoured
to
fit
a
key
the
oaths
which
followed
his
failure
to
do
this
were
not
very
encouraging
to
the
man
behind
nor
was
the
kick
which
he
gave
the
door
after
the
second
more
successful
attempt
calculated
to
act
in
a
very
reassuring
way
upon
anyone
whose
future
pay
for
a
doubtful
task
rested
upon
this
man
good
nature
the
darkness
which
met
them
both
on
the
threshold
of
this
now
open
room
was
speedily
relieved
by
a
burst
of
electric
light
that
flooded
the
whole
apartment
and
brought
out
the
captain
swaggering
form
and
threatening
features
with
startling
distinctness
he
had
thrown
off
his
hat
and
was
relieving
himself
of
a
cloak
in
a
furious
way
that
caused
sweetwater
to
shrink
back
and
as
the
french
say
efface
himself
as
much
as
possible
behind
a
standing
near
the
door
that
the
captain
had
entirely
forgotten
him
was
evident
and
for
the
present
moment
that
gentleman
was
too
angry
to
care
or
even
notice
if
a
dozen
men
stood
at
the
door
as
he
was
talking
all
this
time
or
rather
jerking
out
sharp
sentences
as
men
do
when
in
a
towering
rage
sweetwater
was
glad
to
be
left
unnoticed
for
much
can
be
gathered
from
scattered
sentences
especially
when
a
man
is
in
too
reckless
a
frame
of
mind
to
weigh
them
he
therefore
made
but
little
movement
and
listened
and
these
are
some
of
the
ejaculations
and
scraps
of
talk
he
heard
the
old
fool
honoured
by
my
friendship
but
not
ready
to
accept
me
as
his
daughter
suitor
as
if
i
would
lounge
away
hours
that
mean
dollars
to
me
in
his
stiff
old
just
to
hear
his
everlasting
drone
about
stocks
up
and
stocks
down
and
politics
gone
all
wrong
he
has
heard
that
i
play
cards
and
how
pretty
she
looked
i
believe
i
half
like
that
girl
and
when
i
think
she
has
a
million
in
her
own
right
damn
it
if
i
can
not
win
her
openly
and
with
papa
consent
i
will
carry
her
off
with
only
her
own
she
worth
the
effort
doubly
worth
it
and
when
i
have
her
and
her
money
eh
who
are
you
he
had
seen
sweetwater
at
last
which
was
not
strange
seeing
that
he
had
turned
his
way
and
was
within
two
feet
of
him
what
are
you
doing
here
and
who
let
you
in
get
out
or
a
message
captain
wattles
a
message
from
new
bedford
you
have
forgotten
sir
you
bade
me
follow
you
it
was
curious
to
see
the
menace
slowly
die
out
of
the
face
of
this
flushed
and
angry
man
as
he
met
sweetwater
calm
eye
and
unabashed
front
and
noticed
as
he
had
not
done
at
first
the
slip
of
paper
which
the
latter
resolutely
held
out
new
bedford
ah
from
campbell
i
take
it
let
me
see
and
the
hand
which
had
shook
with
rage
now
trembled
with
a
very
different
sort
of
emotion
as
he
took
the
slip
cast
his
eyes
over
it
and
then
looked
back
at
sweetwater
now
sweetwater
knew
the
two
words
written
on
that
paper
he
could
see
out
of
the
back
of
his
head
at
times
and
he
had
been
able
to
make
out
these
words
when
the
man
in
new
bedford
was
writing
them
happenings
afghanistan
with
the
figures
after
the
latter
not
much
sense
in
them
singly
or
in
conjunction
but
the
captain
muttering
them
over
to
himself
consulted
a
little
book
which
he
took
from
his
breast
pocket
and
found
or
seemed
to
a
clew
to
their
meaning
it
could
only
have
been
a
partial
one
however
for
in
another
instant
he
turned
on
sweetwater
with
a
sour
look
and
a
thundering
oath
is
this
all
he
shouted
does
he
call
this
a
complete
message
there
is
another
word
returned
sweetwater
which
he
bade
me
give
you
by
word
of
mouth
but
that
word
do
go
for
nothing
it
worth
just
dollars
i
earned
it
sir
i
came
up
from
new
bedford
on
purpose
to
deliver
it
to
you
sweetwater
expected
a
blow
but
he
only
got
a
stare
dollars
muttered
the
captain
well
it
fortunate
that
i
have
them
and
who
are
you
he
asked
not
one
of
surely
i
am
a
confidential
messenger
smiled
sweetwater
amused
against
his
will
at
finding
a
name
for
himself
i
carry
messages
and
execute
commissions
that
require
more
or
less
discretion
in
the
handling
i
am
paid
well
dollars
is
the
price
of
this
job
so
you
have
had
the
honour
of
informing
me
before
blustered
the
other
with
an
attempt
to
hide
some
serious
emotion
why
man
what
do
you
fear
do
you
see
i
hurt
you
could
knock
me
over
with
a
feather
if
you
touched
my
game
arm
dollars
repeated
sweetwater
the
captain
grew
angrier
dash
it
are
you
going
to
have
them
what
the
word
but
sweetwater
was
going
to
be
caught
by
chaff
he
insisted
firmly
standing
his
ground
though
certain
that
the
blow
would
now
fall
but
no
the
captain
laughed
and
tugging
away
with
his
one
free
hand
at
his
pocket
he
brought
out
a
from
which
he
managed
deftly
enough
to
draw
out
three
bills
there
said
he
laying
them
on
the
table
but
keeping
one
long
vigorous
finger
on
them
now
the
word
sweetwater
laid
his
own
hand
on
the
bills
frederick
said
he
ah
said
the
other
thoughtfully
lifting
his
finger
and
proceeding
to
stride
up
and
down
the
room
he
a
stiff
one
what
he
says
he
will
do
two
thousand
dollars
and
soon
too
i
warrant
well
i
in
a
devil
of
a
fix
at
last
he
had
again
forgotten
the
presence
of
sweetwater
suddenly
he
turned
or
rather
stopped
his
eye
was
on
the
messenger
but
he
did
not
even
see
him
one
frederick
must
offset
the
other
he
cried
it
the
only
loophole
out
and
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
from
which
he
immediately
sprang
up
again
with
a
yell
he
had
hurt
his
wounded
arm
pandemonium
reigned
in
that
small
room
for
a
minute
then
his
eye
fell
again
on
sweetwater
who
under
the
fascination
of
the
spectacle
offered
him
had
only
just
succeeded
in
finding
the
knob
of
the
door
this
time
there
was
recognition
in
his
look
wait
he
cried
i
may
have
use
for
you
too
confidential
messengers
are
hard
to
come
by
and
one
that
campbell
would
employ
must
be
all
right
sit
down
there
i
talk
to
you
when
i
ready
sweetwater
was
not
slow
in
obeying
this
command
business
was
booming
with
him
besides
the
name
of
frederick
acted
like
a
charm
upon
him
there
seemed
to
be
so
many
fredericks
in
the
world
and
one
of
them
lay
in
such
a
curious
way
near
his
heart
meanwhile
the
captain
reseated
himself
but
more
carefully
he
had
a
plan
or
method
of
procedure
to
think
out
or
so
it
seemed
for
he
sat
a
long
time
in
rigid
immobility
with
only
the
scowl
of
perplexity
or
on
his
brow
to
show
the
nature
of
his
thoughts
then
he
drew
a
sheet
of
paper
toward
him
and
began
to
write
a
letter
he
was
so
absorbed
over
this
letter
and
the
manipulation
of
it
having
but
one
hand
to
work
with
that
sweetwater
determined
upon
a
hazardous
stroke
the
little
book
which
the
captain
had
consulted
and
which
had
undoubtedly
furnished
him
with
a
key
to
those
two
incongruous
words
lay
on
the
floor
not
far
from
him
having
been
flung
from
its
owner
hand
during
the
moments
of
passion
and
suffering
i
have
above
mentioned
to
reach
this
book
with
his
foot
to
draw
it
toward
him
and
finally
to
get
hold
of
it
with
his
hand
was
not
difficult
for
one
who
aspired
to
be
a
detective
and
had
already
done
some
good
work
in
that
direction
but
it
was
harder
to
turn
the
leaves
and
find
the
words
he
sought
without
attracting
the
attention
of
his
fierce
companion
he
however
succeeded
in
doing
this
at
last
the
long
list
of
words
he
found
on
every
page
being
arranged
alphabetically
it
was
a
private
code
for
telegraphic
or
cable
messages
and
he
soon
found
that
happenings
meant
our
little
game
discovered
play
straight
until
i
give
you
the
wink
and
that
afghanistan
stood
for
hush
money
as
the
latter
was
followed
by
the
figures
i
have
mentioned
the
purport
of
the
message
needed
no
explanation
but
the
word
frederick
did
so
he
searched
for
that
only
to
find
that
it
was
not
in
the
book
there
was
but
one
conclusion
to
draw
this
name
was
perfectly
well
known
between
them
and
was
that
of
the
person
no
doubt
who
laid
claim
to
the
two
thousand
dollars
satisfied
at
holding
this
clew
to
the
riddle
he
dropped
the
book
again
at
his
side
and
skilfully
kicked
it
far
out
into
the
room
captain
wattles
had
seen
nothing
he
was
a
man
who
took
in
only
one
thing
at
a
time
the
penning
of
that
letter
went
on
laboriously
it
took
so
long
that
sweetwater
dozed
or
pretended
to
and
when
it
was
at
last
done
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
had
struck
two
halloo
there
now
suddenly
shouted
the
captain
turning
on
the
messenger
are
you
ready
for
another
journey
that
depends
smiled
sweetwater
rising
sleepily
and
advancing
have
got
over
the
last
one
yet
and
would
rather
sleep
than
start
out
again
oh
you
want
pay
well
you
get
that
fast
enough
if
you
succeed
in
your
mission
this
letter
he
shook
it
with
an
impatient
hand
should
be
worth
two
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
to
me
if
you
bring
me
back
that
money
or
its
equivalent
within
hours
i
will
give
you
a
clean
hundred
of
it
good
enough
pay
i
take
it
for
five
journey
better
than
sleep
eh
besides
you
can
doze
on
the
cars
sweetwater
agreed
with
him
in
all
these
assertions
putting
on
his
cap
he
reached
for
the
letter
he
did
like
being
made
an
instrument
for
blackmail
but
he
was
curious
to
see
to
whom
he
was
about
to
be
sent
but
the
captain
had
grown
suddenly
wary
this
is
not
a
letter
to
be
dropped
in
the
mailbox
said
he
you
brought
me
a
line
here
whose
prompt
delivery
has
prevented
me
from
making
a
fool
of
myself
you
must
do
as
much
with
this
one
it
is
to
be
carried
to
its
destination
by
yourself
given
to
the
person
whose
name
you
will
find
written
on
it
and
the
answer
brought
back
before
you
sleep
mind
you
unless
you
snatch
a
wink
or
so
on
the
cars
that
it
is
night
need
not
disturb
you
it
will
be
daylight
before
you
arrive
at
the
place
to
which
this
is
addressed
and
if
you
can
not
get
into
the
house
at
so
early
an
hour
whistle
three
times
like
this
listen
and
one
of
the
windows
will
presently
fly
up
you
have
had
no
trouble
finding
me
you
have
no
trouble
finding
him
when
you
return
hunt
me
up
as
you
did
only
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
to
look
for
me
at
haberstow
he
added
under
his
breath
in
a
tone
that
was
no
doubt
highly
satisfactory
to
himself
i
shall
not
be
there
and
now
off
with
you
he
shouted
you
your
hundred
dollars
to
make
before
daylight
and
it
already
after
two
sweetwater
who
had
stolen
a
glimpse
at
the
superscription
on
the
letter
he
held
stumbled
as
he
went
out
of
the
door
it
was
directed
as
he
had
expected
to
a
frederick
probably
to
the
second
one
of
whom
captain
wattles
had
spoken
but
not
as
he
had
expected
to
a
stranger
the
name
on
the
letter
was
frederick
sutherland
and
the
place
of
his
destination
was
sutherlandtown
xxviii
who
are
you
the
round
had
come
full
circle
by
various
chances
and
a
train
of
circumstances
for
which
he
could
not
account
he
had
been
turned
from
his
first
intention
and
was
being
brought
back
stage
by
stage
to
the
very
spot
he
had
thought
it
his
duty
to
fly
from
was
this
fate
he
began
to
think
so
and
no
longer
so
much
as
dreamed
of
struggling
against
it
but
he
felt
very
much
dazed
and
walked
away
through
the
now
partially
deserted
streets
with
an
odd
sense
of
failure
that
was
only
compensated
by
the
hope
he
now
cherished
of
seeing
his
mother
again
and
being
once
more
caleb
sweetwater
of
sutherlandtown
he
was
clearer
however
after
a
few
blocks
of
rapid
walking
and
then
he
began
to
wonder
over
the
contents
of
the
letter
he
held
and
how
they
would
affect
its
recipient
was
it
a
new
danger
he
was
bringing
him
instead
of
aiding
sutherland
in
keeping
his
dangerous
secret
was
he
destined
to
bring
disgrace
upon
him
not
only
by
his
testimony
before
the
coroner
but
by
means
of
this
letter
which
whatever
it
contained
certainly
could
not
bode
good
to
the
man
from
whom
it
was
designed
to
wrest
two
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
the
fear
that
he
was
destined
to
do
so
grew
upon
him
rapidly
and
the
temptation
to
open
the
letter
and
make
himself
master
of
its
contents
before
leaving
town
at
last
became
so
strong
that
his
sense
of
honour
paled
before
it
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
before
he
ventured
into
the
precincts
of
sutherlandtown
he
would
know
just
what
sort
of
a
bombshell
he
was
carrying
into
the
sutherland
family
to
do
this
he
stopped
at
the
first
respectable
he
encountered
and
hired
a
room
calling
for
hot
water
piping
hot
he
told
them
he
subjected
the
letter
to
the
effects
of
steam
and
presently
had
it
open
he
was
not
disappointed
in
its
contents
save
that
they
were
even
more
dangerous
than
he
had
anticipated
captain
wattles
was
an
old
crony
of
and
knew
his
record
better
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
from
this
fact
and
the
added
one
that
frederick
had
stood
in
special
need
of
money
at
the
time
of
agatha
webb
murder
the
writer
had
no
hesitation
in
believing
him
guilty
of
the
crime
which
opened
his
way
to
a
fortune
and
though
under
ordinary
circumstances
he
would
as
his
friend
frederick
already
knew
be
perfectly
willing
to
keep
his
opinions
to
himself
he
was
just
now
under
the
same
necessity
for
money
that
frederick
had
been
at
that
fatal
time
and
must
therefore
see
the
colour
of
two
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
before
the
day
was
out
if
frederick
desired
to
have
his
name
kept
out
of
the
boston
papers
that
it
had
been
kept
out
up
to
this
time
argued
that
the
crime
had
been
well
enough
hidden
to
make
the
alternative
thus
offered
an
important
one
there
was
no
signature
sweetwater
affected
to
an
extent
he
little
expected
resealed
the
letter
made
his
excuses
to
the
landlord
and
left
the
house
now
he
could
see
why
he
had
not
been
allowed
to
make
his
useless
sacrifice
another
man
than
himself
suspected
frederick
and
by
a
word
could
precipitate
the
doom
he
already
saw
hung
too
low
above
the
devoted
head
of
sutherland
son
to
be
averted
yet
i
attempt
that
too
burst
impetuously
from
his
lips
if
i
fail
i
can
but
go
back
with
a
knowledge
of
this
added
danger
if
i
succeed
why
i
must
still
go
back
from
some
persons
and
from
some
complications
it
is
useless
to
attempt
flight
returning
to
the
he
had
first
entered
in
his
search
for
captain
wattles
he
asked
if
that
gentleman
had
yet
come
in
this
time
he
was
answered
by
an
affirmative
though
he
might
almost
as
well
have
not
been
for
the
captain
was
playing
cards
in
a
private
room
and
would
not
submit
to
any
interruption
he
will
submit
to
mine
retorted
sweetwater
to
the
man
who
had
told
him
this
or
wait
hand
him
back
this
letter
and
say
that
the
messenger
refuses
to
deliver
it
this
brought
the
captain
out
as
he
had
fully
expected
it
would
why
what
began
that
gentleman
in
a
furious
rage
but
sweetwater
laying
his
hand
on
the
arm
he
knew
to
be
so
sensitive
rose
on
tiptoe
and
managed
to
whisper
in
the
angry
man
ear
you
are
a
and
it
will
be
easy
enough
to
ruin
you
threaten
frederick
sutherland
and
in
two
weeks
you
will
be
boycotted
by
every
club
in
this
city
hundred
dollars
wo
pay
you
for
that
this
from
a
nondescript
fellow
with
no
grains
of
a
gentleman
about
him
in
form
feature
or
apparel
the
captain
stared
nonplussed
too
much
taken
aback
to
be
even
angry
suddenly
he
cried
how
do
you
know
all
this
how
do
you
know
what
is
or
is
not
in
the
letter
i
gave
you
sweetwater
with
a
shrug
that
in
its
quiet
significance
seemed
to
make
him
at
once
the
equal
of
his
interrogator
quietly
pressed
the
quivering
limb
under
his
hand
and
calmly
replied
i
know
because
i
have
read
it
before
putting
my
head
in
the
mouth
i
make
it
a
point
to
count
his
teeth
and
lifting
his
hand
he
drew
back
leaving
the
captain
reeling
what
is
your
name
who
are
you
shouted
out
wattles
as
sweetwater
was
drawing
off
it
was
the
third
time
he
had
been
asked
that
question
within
hours
but
not
before
with
this
telling
emphasis
who
are
you
i
say
and
what
can
you
do
to
me
i
am
but
that
is
an
insignificant
detail
unworthy
of
your
curiosity
as
to
what
i
can
do
wait
and
see
but
first
burn
that
letter
and
turning
his
back
he
fled
out
of
the
building
followed
by
oaths
which
if
not
loud
were
certainly
deep
and
very
it
was
the
first
time
captain
wattles
had
met
his
match
in
audacity
xxix
home
again
on
his
way
to
the
depot
sweetwater
went
into
the
herald
office
and
bought
a
morning
paper
at
the
station
he
opened
it
there
was
one
column
devoted
to
the
wreck
of
the
hesper
and
a
whole
to
the
proceedings
of
the
third
day
inquiry
into
the
cause
and
manner
of
agatha
webb
death
merely
noting
that
his
name
was
mentioned
among
the
lost
in
the
first
article
he
began
to
read
the
latter
with
justifiable
eagerness
the
assurance
given
in
captain
wattles
letter
was
true
no
direct
suspicion
had
as
yet
fallen
on
frederick
as
the
lover
of
amabel
page
his
name
was
necessarily
mentioned
but
neither
in
the
account
of
the
inquest
nor
in
the
editorials
on
the
subject
could
he
find
any
proof
that
either
the
public
or
police
had
got
hold
of
the
great
idea
that
he
was
the
man
who
had
preceded
amabel
to
agatha
cottage
relieved
on
this
score
sweetwater
entered
more
fully
into
the
particulars
and
found
that
though
the
jury
had
sat
three
days
very
little
more
had
come
to
light
than
was
known
on
the
morning
he
made
that
bold
dash
into
the
hesper
most
of
the
witnesses
had
given
in
their
testimony
being
the
chief
and
though
no
open
accusation
had
been
made
it
was
evident
from
the
trend
of
the
questions
put
to
the
latter
that
connection
with
the
affair
was
looked
upon
as
criminal
and
as
placing
her
in
a
very
suspicious
light
her
replies
however
as
once
before
under
a
similar
but
less
formal
examination
failed
to
convey
any
recognition
on
her
part
either
of
this
suspicion
or
of
her
own
position
yet
they
were
not
exactly
frank
and
sweetwater
saw
or
thought
he
saw
naturally
failing
to
have
a
key
to
the
situation
that
she
was
still
working
upon
her
old
plan
of
saving
both
herself
and
frederick
by
throwing
whatever
suspicion
her
words
might
raise
upon
the
deceased
zabel
he
did
not
know
and
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
that
he
did
not
at
this
especial
juncture
that
she
was
only
biding
her
time
now
very
nearly
at
hand
and
that
instead
of
loving
frederick
she
hated
him
and
was
determined
upon
his
destruction
reading
as
a
final
clause
that
sutherland
was
expected
to
testify
soon
in
explanation
of
his
position
as
executor
of
webb
will
sweetwater
grew
very
serious
and
while
no
change
took
place
in
his
mind
as
to
his
present
duty
he
decided
that
his
return
must
be
as
unobtrusive
as
possible
and
his
only
too
timely
reappearance
on
the
scene
of
the
inquiry
kept
secret
till
sutherland
had
given
his
evidence
and
retired
from
under
the
eyes
of
his
excited
the
sight
of
me
might
unnerve
him
was
sweetwater
thought
precipitating
the
very
catastrophe
we
dread
one
look
one
word
on
his
part
indicative
of
his
inner
apprehensions
that
his
son
had
a
hand
in
the
crime
which
has
so
benefited
him
and
nothing
can
save
frederick
from
the
charge
of
murder
not
knapp
skill
my
silence
or
finesse
the
young
man
will
be
lost
he
did
not
know
as
we
do
that
amabel
finesse
was
devoted
to
winning
a
husband
for
herself
and
that
in
the
event
of
failure
the
action
she
threatened
against
her
quondam
lover
would
be
precipitated
that
very
day
at
the
moment
when
the
clock
struck
twelve
sweetwater
arrived
home
by
the
way
of
portchester
he
had
seen
one
or
two
persons
he
knew
but
so
far
had
himself
escaped
recognition
the
morning
light
was
dimly
breaking
when
he
strode
into
the
outskirts
of
sutherlandtown
and
began
to
descend
the
hill
as
he
passed
halliday
house
he
looked
up
and
was
astonished
to
see
a
light
burning
in
one
deeply
embowered
window
alas
he
did
not
know
how
early
one
anxious
heart
woke
during
those
troublous
days
the
sutherland
house
was
dark
but
as
he
crept
very
close
under
its
overhanging
eaves
he
heard
a
deep
sigh
uttered
over
his
head
and
knew
that
someone
was
up
here
also
in
anxious
expectation
of
a
day
that
was
destined
to
hold
more
than
even
he
anticipated
meanwhile
the
sea
grew
rosy
and
the
mother
cottage
was
as
yet
far
off
hurrying
on
he
came
at
last
under
the
eye
of
more
than
one
of
the
early
risers
of
sutherlandtown
what
sweetwater
alive
and
well
hey
sweetwater
we
thought
you
were
lost
on
the
hesper
halloo
home
in
time
to
see
the
pretty
amabel
arrested
phrases
like
these
met
him
at
more
than
one
corner
but
he
eluded
them
all
stopping
only
to
put
one
hesitating
question
was
his
mother
well
home
fears
had
made
themselves
felt
with
his
near
approach
to
that
humble
cottage

xxx
what
followed
the
striking
of
the
clock
it
was
the
last
day
of
the
inquest
and
to
many
it
bade
fair
to
be
the
least
interesting
all
the
witnesses
who
had
anything
to
say
had
long
ago
given
in
their
testimony
and
when
at
or
near
noon
sweetwater
slid
into
the
inconspicuous
seat
he
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
near
the
coroner
it
was
to
find
in
two
faces
only
any
signs
of
the
eagerness
and
expectancy
which
filled
his
own
breast
to
suffocation
but
as
these
faces
were
those
of
agnes
halliday
and
amabel
page
he
soon
recognised
that
his
own
judgment
was
not
at
fault
and
that
notwithstanding
outward
appearances
and
the
languid
interest
shown
in
the
now
lagging
proceedings
the
moment
presaged
an
event
full
of
unseen
but
vital
consequence
frederick
was
not
visible
in
the
great
hall
but
that
he
was
near
at
hand
soon
became
evident
from
the
change
sweetwater
now
saw
in
amabel
for
while
she
had
hitherto
sat
under
the
universal
gaze
with
only
the
faint
smile
of
conscious
beauty
on
her
inscrutable
features
she
roused
as
the
hands
of
the
clock
moved
toward
noon
and
glanced
at
the
great
door
of
entrance
with
an
evil
expectancy
that
startled
even
sweetwater
so
little
had
he
really
understood
the
nature
of
the
passions
labouring
in
that
venomous
breast
next
moment
the
door
opened
and
frederick
and
his
father
came
in
the
air
of
triumphant
satisfaction
with
which
amabel
sank
back
into
her
seat
was
as
marked
in
its
character
as
her
previous
suspense
what
did
it
mean
sweetwater
noting
it
and
the
vivid
contrast
it
offered
to
frederick
air
of
depression
felt
that
his
return
had
been
well
timed
sutherland
was
looking
very
feeble
as
he
took
the
chair
offered
him
the
change
in
his
appearance
was
apparent
to
all
who
knew
him
and
there
were
few
there
who
did
not
know
him
and
startled
by
these
evidences
of
suffering
which
they
could
not
understand
and
feared
to
interpret
even
to
themselves
more
than
one
devoted
friend
stole
uneasy
glances
at
frederick
to
see
if
he
too
were
under
the
cloud
which
seemed
to
envelop
his
father
almost
beyond
recognition
but
frederick
was
looking
at
amabel
and
his
erect
head
and
determined
aspect
made
him
a
conspicuous
figure
in
the
room
she
who
had
called
up
this
expression
and
alone
comprehended
it
fully
smiled
as
she
met
his
eye
with
that
curious
slow
dipping
of
her
dimples
which
had
more
than
once
confounded
the
coroner
and
rendered
her
at
once
the
admiration
and
abhorrence
of
the
crowd
who
for
so
long
a
time
had
had
the
opportunity
of
watching
her
frederick
to
whom
this
smile
conveyed
a
last
hope
as
well
as
a
last
threat
looked
away
as
soon
as
possible
but
not
before
her
eyes
had
fallen
in
their
old
inquiring
way
to
his
hands
from
which
he
had
removed
the
ring
which
up
to
this
hour
he
had
invariably
worn
on
his
third
finger
in
this
glance
of
hers
and
this
action
of
his
began
the
struggle
that
was
to
make
that
day
memorable
in
many
hearts
after
the
first
stir
occasioned
by
the
entrance
of
two
such
important
persons
the
crowd
settled
back
into
its
old
quietude
under
the
hand
a
tedious
witness
was
having
his
slow
say
and
to
him
a
full
attention
was
being
given
in
the
hope
that
some
real
enlightenment
would
come
at
last
to
settle
the
questions
which
had
been
raised
by
incomplete
and
unsatisfactory
testimony
but
no
man
can
furnish
what
he
does
not
possess
and
the
few
final
minutes
before
noon
passed
by
without
any
addition
being
made
to
the
facts
which
had
already
been
presented
for
general
consideration
as
the
witness
sat
down
the
clock
began
to
strike
as
the
slow
hesitating
strokes
rang
out
sweetwater
saw
frederick
yield
to
a
sudden
but
most
profound
emotion
the
old
fear
which
we
understand
if
sweetwater
did
not
had
again
seized
the
victim
of
amabel
ambition
and
under
her
eye
which
was
blazing
full
upon
him
now
with
a
fell
and
steady
purpose
he
found
his
right
hand
stealing
toward
the
left
in
the
significant
action
she
expected
better
to
yield
than
fall
headlong
into
the
pit
one
word
of
hers
would
open
he
had
not
meant
to
yield
but
now
that
the
moment
had
come
now
that
he
must
at
once
and
forever
choose
between
a
course
that
led
simply
to
personal
unhappiness
and
one
that
involved
not
only
himself
but
those
dearest
to
him
in
disgrace
and
sorrow
he
felt
himself
weaken
to
the
point
of
clutching
at
whatever
would
save
him
from
the
consequences
of
confession
moral
strength
and
that
tenacity
of
purpose
which
only
comes
from
years
of
were
too
lately
awakened
in
his
breast
to
sustain
him
now
as
stroke
after
stroke
fell
on
the
ear
he
felt
himself
yielding
beyond
recovery
and
had
almost
touched
his
finger
in
the
significant
action
of
assent
which
amabel
awaited
with
breathless
expectation
when
was
it
miracle
or
only
the
suggestion
of
his
better
nature
the
memory
of
a
face
full
of
holy
pleading
rose
from
the
past
before
his
eyes
and
with
an
inner
cry
of
mother
he
flung
his
hand
out
and
clutched
his
father
arm
in
a
way
to
break
the
charm
of
his
own
dread
and
end
forever
the
effects
of
the
intolerable
fascination
that
was
working
upon
him
next
minute
the
last
stroke
of
noon
rang
out
and
the
hour
was
up
which
amabel
had
set
as
the
limit
of
her
silence
a
pause
which
to
their
two
hearts
if
to
no
others
seemed
strangely
appropriate
followed
the
cessation
of
these
sounds
then
the
witness
was
dismissed
and
amabel
taking
advantage
of
the
movement
was
about
to
lean
toward
courtney
when
frederick
leaping
with
a
bound
to
his
feet
drew
all
eyes
towards
himself
with
the
cry
let
me
be
put
on
my
oath
i
have
testimony
to
give
of
the
utmost
importance
in
this
case
the
coroner
was
astounded
everyone
was
astounded
no
one
had
expected
anything
from
him
and
instinctively
every
eye
turned
towards
amabel
to
see
how
she
was
affected
by
his
action
strangely
evidently
for
the
look
with
which
she
settled
back
in
her
seat
was
one
which
no
one
who
saw
it
ever
forgot
though
it
conveyed
no
hint
of
her
real
feelings
which
were
somewhat
chaotic
frederick
who
had
forgotten
her
now
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
speak
waited
for
the
coroner
reply
if
you
have
testimony
said
that
gentleman
after
exchanging
a
few
hurried
words
with
courtney
and
the
surprised
knapp
you
can
do
no
better
than
give
it
to
us
at
once
frederick
sutherland
will
you
take
the
stand
with
a
noble
air
from
which
all
hesitation
had
vanished
frederick
started
towards
the
place
indicated
but
stopped
before
he
had
taken
a
steps
and
glanced
back
at
his
father
who
was
visibly
succumbing
under
this
last
shock
go
he
whispered
but
in
so
thrilling
a
tone
it
was
heard
to
the
remotest
corner
of
the
room
spare
me
the
anguish
of
saying
what
i
have
to
say
in
your
presence
i
could
not
bear
it
you
could
not
bear
it
later
if
you
will
wait
for
me
in
one
of
these
rooms
i
will
repeat
my
tale
in
your
ears
but
go
now
it
is
my
last
entreaty
there
was
a
silence
no
one
ventured
a
dissent
no
one
so
much
as
made
a
gesture
of
disapproval
then
sutherland
struggled
to
his
feet
cast
one
last
look
around
him
and
disappeared
through
a
door
which
had
opened
like
magic
before
him
then
and
not
till
then
did
frederick
move
forward
the
moment
was
intense
the
coroner
seemed
to
share
the
universal
excitement
for
his
first
question
was
a
leading
one
and
brought
out
this
startling
admission
i
have
obtruded
myself
into
this
inquiry
and
now
ask
to
be
heard
by
this
jury
because
no
man
knows
more
than
i
do
of
the
manner
and
cause
of
agatha
webb
death
this
you
will
believe
when
i
tell
you
that
was
the
person
miss
page
followed
into
webb
house
and
whom
she
heard
descend
the
stairs
during
the
moment
she
crouched
behind
the
figure
of
the
sleeping
philemon
it
was
more
infinitely
more
than
anyone
there
had
expected
it
was
not
only
an
acknowledgment
but
a
confession
and
the
shock
the
surprise
the
alarm
which
it
occasioned
even
to
those
who
had
never
had
much
confidence
in
this
young
man
virtue
was
almost
appalling
in
its
intensity
had
it
not
been
for
the
consciousness
of
near
presence
the
feeling
would
have
risen
to
outbreak
and
many
voices
were
held
in
subjection
by
the
remembrance
of
this
venerated
man
last
look
that
otherwise
would
have
made
themselves
heard
in
despite
of
the
restrictions
of
the
place
and
the
authority
of
the
police
to
frederick
it
was
a
moment
of
immeasurable
grief
and
humiliation
on
every
face
in
every
shrinking
form
in
subdued
murmurs
and
open
cries
he
read
instant
and
complete
condemnation
and
yet
in
all
his
life
from
boyhood
up
to
this
hour
never
had
he
been
so
worthy
of
their
esteem
and
consideration
but
though
he
felt
the
iron
enter
his
soul
he
did
not
lose
his
determined
attitude
he
had
observed
a
change
in
amabel
and
a
change
in
agnes
and
if
only
to
disappoint
the
vile
triumph
of
the
one
and
raise
again
the
drooping
courage
of
the
other
he
withstood
the
clamour
and
began
speaking
again
before
the
coroner
had
been
able
to
fully
restore
quiet
i
know
said
he
what
this
acknowledgment
must
convey
to
the
minds
of
the
jury
and
people
here
assembled
but
if
anyone
who
listens
to
me
thinks
me
guilty
of
the
death
i
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
witnessed
he
will
be
doing
me
a
wrong
which
agatha
webb
would
be
the
first
to
condemn
talbot
and
you
gentlemen
of
the
jury
in
the
face
of
god
and
man
i
here
declare
that
webb
in
my
presence
and
before
my
eyes
gave
to
herself
the
blow
which
has
robbed
us
all
of
a
most
valuable
life
she
was
not
murdered
it
was
a
solemn
assertion
but
it
failed
to
convince
the
crowd
before
him
as
by
one
impulse
men
and
women
broke
into
a
tumult
sutherland
was
forgotten
and
cries
of
never
she
was
too
good
it
all
calumny
a
wretched
lie
broke
in
unrestrained
excitement
from
every
part
of
the
large
room
in
vain
the
coroner
smote
with
his
gavel
in
vain
the
local
police
endeavoured
to
restore
order
the
tide
was
up
and
everything
for
an
instant
till
silence
was
suddenly
restored
by
the
sight
of
amabel
smoothing
out
the
folds
of
her
crisp
white
frock
with
an
incredulous
almost
insulting
smile
that
at
once
fixed
attention
again
on
frederick
he
seized
the
occasion
and
spoke
up
in
a
tone
of
great
resolve
i
have
made
an
assertion
said
he
before
god
and
before
this
jury
to
make
it
seem
a
credible
one
i
shall
have
to
tell
my
own
story
from
the
beginning
am
i
allowed
to
do
so
mr
coroner
you
are
was
the
firm
response
then
gentlemen
continued
frederick
still
without
looking
at
amabel
whose
smile
had
acquired
a
mockery
that
drew
the
eyes
of
the
jury
toward
her
more
than
once
during
the
following
recital
you
know
and
the
public
generally
now
know
that
webb
has
left
me
the
greater
portion
of
the
money
of
which
she
died
possessed
i
have
never
before
acknowledged
to
anyone
not
even
to
the
good
man
who
awaits
this
verdict
on
the
other
side
of
that
door
yonder
that
she
had
reasons
for
this
good
reasons
reasons
of
which
up
to
the
very
evening
of
her
death
i
was
myself
ignorant
as
i
was
ignorant
of
her
intentions
in
my
regard
or
that
i
was
the
special
object
of
her
attention
or
that
we
were
under
any
mutual
obligations
in
any
way
why
then
i
should
have
thought
of
going
to
her
in
the
great
strait
in
which
i
found
myself
on
that
day
i
can
not
say
i
knew
she
had
money
in
her
house
this
i
had
unhappily
been
made
acquainted
with
in
an
accidental
way
and
i
knew
she
was
of
kindly
disposition
and
quite
capable
of
doing
a
very
unselfish
act
still
this
would
not
seem
to
be
reason
enough
for
me
to
intrude
upon
her
late
at
night
with
a
plea
for
a
large
loan
of
money
had
i
not
been
in
a
desperate
condition
of
mind
which
made
any
attempt
seem
reasonable
that
promised
relief
from
the
unendurable
burden
of
a
pressing
and
disreputable
debt
i
was
obliged
to
have
money
a
great
deal
of
money
and
i
had
to
have
it
at
once
and
while
i
know
that
this
will
not
serve
to
lighten
the
suspicion
i
have
brought
upon
myself
by
my
late
admissions
it
is
the
only
explanation
i
can
give
you
for
leaving
the
ball
at
my
father
house
and
hurrying
down
secretly
and
alone
into
town
to
the
little
cottage
where
as
i
had
been
told
early
in
the
evening
a
small
entertainment
was
being
given
which
would
insure
its
being
open
even
at
so
late
an
hour
as
midnight
miss
page
who
will
i
am
sure
pardon
the
introduction
of
her
name
into
this
narrative
has
taken
pains
to
declare
to
you
that
in
the
expedition
she
herself
made
into
town
that
evening
she
followed
some
person
steps
this
is
very
likely
true
and
those
steps
were
probably
mine
for
after
leaving
the
house
by
the
garden
door
i
came
directly
down
the
main
road
to
the
corner
of
the
lane
running
past
webb
cottage
having
already
seen
from
the
hillside
the
light
burning
in
her
upper
windows
i
felt
encouraged
to
proceed
and
so
hastened
on
till
i
came
to
the
gate
on
high
street
here
i
had
a
moment
of
hesitation
and
thoughts
bitter
enough
for
me
to
recall
them
at
this
moment
came
into
my
mind
making
that
instant
perhaps
the
very
worst
in
my
life
but
they
passed
thank
god
and
with
no
more
desperate
feeling
than
a
sullen
intention
of
having
my
own
way
about
this
money
i
lifted
the
latch
of
the
front
door
and
stepped
in
i
had
expected
to
find
a
jovial
group
of
friends
in
her
little
ground
parlour
or
at
least
to
hear
the
sound
of
merry
voices
and
laughter
in
the
rooms
above
but
no
sounds
of
any
sort
awaited
me
indeed
the
house
seemed
strangely
silent
for
one
so
fully
lighted
and
astonished
at
this
i
pushed
the
door
ajar
at
my
left
and
looked
in
an
unexpected
and
pitiful
sight
awaited
me
seated
at
a
table
set
with
abundance
of
untasted
food
i
saw
the
master
of
the
house
with
his
head
sunk
forward
on
his
arms
asleep
the
expected
guests
had
failed
to
arrive
and
he
tired
out
with
waiting
had
fallen
into
a
doze
at
the
board
this
was
a
condition
of
things
for
which
i
was
not
prepared
webb
whom
i
wished
to
see
was
probably
and
while
i
might
summon
her
by
a
sturdy
rap
on
the
door
beside
which
i
stood
i
had
so
little
desire
to
wake
her
husband
of
whose
mental
condition
i
was
well
aware
that
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
make
any
loud
noise
within
his
hearing
yet
i
had
not
the
courage
to
retreat
all
my
hope
of
relief
from
the
many
difficulties
that
menaced
me
lay
in
the
generosity
of
this
woman
and
if
out
of
pusillanimity
i
let
this
hour
go
by
without
making
my
appeal
nothing
but
shame
and
disaster
awaited
me
yet
how
could
i
hope
to
lure
her
without
noise
i
could
not
and
so
yielding
to
the
impulse
of
the
moment
without
any
realisation
i
here
swear
of
the
effect
which
my
unexpected
presence
would
have
on
the
noble
woman
overhead
i
slipped
up
the
narrow
staircase
and
catching
at
that
moment
the
sound
of
her
voice
calling
out
to
batsy
i
stepped
up
to
the
door
i
saw
standing
open
before
me
and
confronted
her
before
she
could
move
from
the
table
before
which
she
was
sitting
counting
over
a
large
roll
of
money
my
look
and
it
was
doubtless
not
a
common
look
for
the
sight
of
a
mass
of
money
at
that
moment
when
money
was
everything
to
me
roused
every
lurking
demon
in
my
breast
seemed
to
appall
if
it
did
not
frighten
her
for
she
rose
and
meeting
my
eye
with
a
gaze
in
which
shock
and
some
strange
and
poignant
agony
totally
incomprehensible
to
me
were
strangely
blended
she
cried
out
no
frederick
you
do
know
what
you
are
doing
if
you
want
my
money
take
it
if
you
want
my
life
i
will
give
it
to
you
with
my
own
hand
do
stain
yours
do
i
did
not
understand
her
i
did
not
know
until
i
thought
it
over
afterward
that
my
hand
was
thrust
convulsively
into
my
breast
in
a
way
which
taken
with
my
wild
mien
made
me
look
as
if
i
had
come
to
murder
her
for
the
money
over
which
she
was
hovering
i
was
blind
deaf
to
everything
but
that
money
and
bending
madly
forward
in
a
state
of
mental
intoxication
awful
enough
for
me
to
remember
now
i
answered
her
frenzied
words
by
some
such
broken
exclamations
as
these
then
i
want
hundreds
thousands
now
now
to
save
myself
disgrace
shame
prison
await
me
if
i
do
have
them
give
give
and
my
hand
went
out
toward
it
not
toward
her
but
she
mistook
the
action
mistook
my
purpose
and
with
a
cry
to
save
me
me
from
crime
the
worst
crime
of
which
humanity
is
capable
she
caught
up
a
dagger
lying
only
too
near
her
hand
in
the
open
drawer
against
which
she
leaned
and
in
a
moment
of
fathomless
anguish
which
we
who
can
never
know
more
than
the
outward
seeming
of
her
life
can
hardly
measure
plunged
against
it
and
i
can
tell
you
no
more
her
blood
and
shriek
from
the
adjoining
room
swam
through
my
consciousness
and
then
she
fell
as
i
supposed
dead
upon
the
floor
and
i
in
scarcely
better
case
fell
also
this
as
god
lives
is
the
truth
concerning
the
wound
found
in
the
breast
of
this
woman
the
feeling
the
pathos
the
anguish
even
to
be
found
in
his
tone
made
this
story
strange
and
incredible
as
it
seemed
appear
for
the
moment
plausible
and
batsy
asked
the
coroner
must
have
fallen
when
we
did
for
i
never
heard
her
voice
after
the
first
scream
but
i
shall
speak
of
her
again
what
i
must
now
explain
is
how
the
money
in
webb
drawer
came
into
my
possession
and
how
the
dagger
she
had
planted
in
her
breast
came
to
be
found
on
the
lawn
outside
when
i
came
to
myself
and
that
must
have
been
very
soon
i
found
that
the
blow
of
which
i
had
been
such
a
horrified
witness
had
not
yet
proved
fatal
the
eyes
i
had
seen
close
as
i
had
supposed
forever
were
now
open
and
she
was
looking
at
me
with
a
smile
that
has
never
left
my
memory
and
never
will
is
no
blood
on
you
she
murmured
did
not
strike
the
blow
was
it
money
only
that
you
wanted
frederick
if
so
you
could
have
had
it
without
crime
there
are
five
hundred
dollars
on
that
table
take
them
and
let
them
pave
your
way
to
a
better
life
my
death
will
help
you
to
remember
do
these
words
this
action
of
hers
seem
incredible
to
you
sirs
alas
alas
they
will
not
when
i
tell
you
and
here
he
cast
one
anxious
deeply
anxious
glance
at
the
room
in
which
sutherland
was
hidden
that
unknown
to
me
unknown
to
anyone
living
but
herself
unknown
to
that
good
man
from
whom
it
can
no
longer
be
kept
hidden
agatha
webb
was
my
mother
i
am
philemon
son
and
not
the
offspring
of
charles
and
marietta
sutherland
xxxi
a
witness
lost
impossible
incredible
like
a
wave
suddenly
lifted
the
whole
assemblage
rose
in
surprise
if
not
in
protest
but
there
was
no
outburst
the
very
depth
of
the
feelings
evoked
made
all
ebullition
impossible
and
as
one
sees
the
billow
pause
ere
it
breaks
and
gradually
subside
so
this
crowd
yielded
to
its
awe
and
man
by
man
sank
back
into
his
seat
till
quiet
was
again
restored
and
only
a
circle
of
listening
faces
confronted
the
man
who
had
just
stirred
a
whole
roomful
to
its
depths
seeing
this
and
realising
his
opportunity
frederick
at
once
entered
into
the
explanations
for
which
each
heart
there
panted
this
will
be
overwhelming
news
to
him
who
has
cared
for
me
since
infancy
you
have
heard
him
call
me
son
with
what
words
shall
i
overthrow
his
confidence
in
the
truth
and
rectitude
of
his
wife
and
make
him
know
in
his
old
age
that
he
has
wasted
years
of
patience
upon
one
who
was
not
of
his
blood
or
lineage
the
wonder
the
incredulity
you
manifest
are
my
best
excuse
for
my
long
delay
in
revealing
the
secret
entrusted
to
me
by
this
dying
woman
an
awed
silence
greeted
these
words
never
was
the
interest
of
a
crowd
more
intense
or
its
passions
held
in
greater
restraint
yet
tears
flowed
freely
and
amabel
smiles
well
their
expression
had
changed
and
to
sweetwater
who
alone
had
eyes
for
her
now
they
were
surcharged
with
a
tragic
meaning
strange
to
see
in
one
of
her
callous
nature
frederick
voice
broke
as
he
proceeded
in
his
task
the
astounding
fact
which
i
have
just
communicated
to
you
was
made
known
by
my
mother
with
the
dagger
still
plunged
in
her
breast
she
would
not
let
me
draw
it
out
she
knew
that
death
would
follow
that
act
and
she
prized
every
moment
remaining
to
her
because
of
the
bliss
she
enjoyed
of
seeing
and
having
near
her
her
only
living
child
the
love
the
passion
the
boundless
devotion
she
showed
in
those
last
few
minutes
transformed
me
in
an
instant
from
a
selfish
brute
into
a
deeply
repentant
man
i
knelt
before
her
in
anguish
i
made
her
feel
that
wicked
as
i
had
been
i
was
not
the
conscienceless
wretch
she
had
imagined
and
that
she
was
mistaken
as
to
the
motives
which
led
me
into
her
presence
and
when
i
saw
by
her
clearing
brow
and
peaceful
look
that
i
had
fully
persuaded
her
of
this
i
let
her
speak
what
words
she
would
and
tell
as
she
was
able
the
secret
tragedy
of
her
life
it
is
a
sacred
story
to
me
and
if
you
must
know
it
let
it
be
from
her
own
words
in
the
letters
she
left
behind
her
she
only
told
me
that
to
save
me
from
the
fate
of
the
children
who
had
preceded
me
the
five
little
girls
and
boys
who
had
perished
almost
at
birth
in
her
arms
she
had
parted
from
me
in
early
infancy
to
sutherland
then
mourning
the
sudden
death
of
her
only
child
that
this
had
been
done
secretly
and
under
circumstances
calculated
to
deceive
sutherland
consequently
he
had
never
known
i
was
not
his
own
child
and
in
terror
of
the
effect
which
the
truth
might
have
upon
him
she
enjoined
me
not
to
enlighten
him
now
if
by
any
sacrifice
on
my
part
i
could
rightfully
avoid
it
that
she
was
happy
in
having
me
hear
the
truth
before
she
died
that
the
joy
which
this
gave
her
was
so
great
she
did
not
regret
her
fatal
act
violent
and
uncalled
for
as
it
was
for
it
had
showed
her
my
heart
and
allowed
me
to
read
hers
then
she
talked
of
my
father
by
whom
i
mean
him
whom
you
call
philemon
and
she
made
me
promise
i
would
care
for
him
to
the
last
with
tenderness
saying
that
i
would
be
able
to
do
this
without
seeming
impropriety
since
she
had
willed
me
all
her
fortune
under
this
proviso
finally
she
gave
me
a
key
and
pointing
out
where
the
money
lay
hidden
bade
me
carry
it
away
as
her
last
gift
together
with
the
package
of
letters
i
would
find
with
it
and
when
i
had
taken
these
and
given
her
back
the
key
she
told
me
that
but
for
one
thing
she
would
die
happy
and
though
her
strength
and
breath
were
fast
failing
her
she
made
me
understand
that
she
was
worried
about
the
zabels
who
had
not
come
according
to
a
sacred
custom
between
them
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
her
wedding
and
prayed
me
to
see
the
two
old
gentlemen
before
i
slept
since
nothing
but
death
or
dire
distress
would
have
kept
them
from
gratifying
the
one
whim
of
my
father
failing
mind
i
promised
and
with
perfect
peace
in
her
face
she
pointed
to
the
dagger
in
her
breast
but
before
i
could
lay
my
hand
upon
it
she
called
for
batsy
want
her
to
hear
me
declare
before
i
go
said
she
this
stroke
was
delivered
by
myself
upon
myself
but
when
i
rose
to
look
for
batsy
i
found
that
the
shock
of
her
mistress
fatal
act
had
killed
her
and
that
only
her
dead
body
was
lying
across
the
of
the
adjoining
room
it
was
a
chance
that
robbed
me
of
the
only
witness
who
could
testify
to
my
innocence
in
case
my
presence
in
this
house
of
death
should
become
known
and
realising
all
the
danger
in
which
it
threw
me
i
did
not
dare
to
tell
my
mother
for
fear
it
would
make
her
last
moments
miserable
so
i
told
her
that
the
poor
woman
had
understood
what
she
wished
but
was
too
terrified
to
move
or
speak
and
this
satisfied
my
mother
and
made
her
last
breath
one
of
trust
and
contented
love
she
died
as
i
drew
the
dagger
from
her
breast
and
seeing
this
i
was
seized
with
horror
of
the
instrument
which
had
cost
me
such
a
dear
and
valuable
life
and
flung
it
wildly
from
the
window
then
i
lifted
her
and
laid
her
where
you
found
her
on
the
sofa
i
did
not
know
that
the
dagger
was
an
gift
of
her
former
lover
james
zabel
much
less
that
it
bore
his
initials
on
the
handle
he
paused
and
the
awe
occasioned
by
the
scene
he
had
described
was
so
deep
and
the
silence
so
prolonged
that
a
shudder
passed
over
the
whole
assemblage
when
from
some
unknown
quarter
a
single
cutting
voice
arose
in
this
one
short
mocking
comment
oh
the
fairy
tale
was
it
amabel
who
spoke
some
thought
so
and
looked
her
way
but
they
only
beheld
a
sweet
face
turned
with
an
air
of
moving
appeal
upon
frederick
as
if
begging
pardon
for
the
wicked
doubts
which
had
driven
him
to
this
defence
frederick
met
that
look
with
one
so
severe
it
partook
of
harshness
then
resuming
his
testimony
he
said
it
is
of
the
zabel
brothers
i
must
now
speak
and
of
how
one
of
them
james
by
name
came
to
be
involved
in
this
affair
when
i
left
my
dead
mother
side
i
was
in
such
a
state
of
mind
that
i
passed
with
scarcely
so
much
as
a
glance
the
room
where
my
father
sat
sleeping
but
as
i
hastened
on
toward
the
quarter
where
the
zabels
lived
i
was
seized
by
such
compunction
for
his
desolate
state
that
i
faltered
in
my
rapid
flight
and
did
not
arrive
at
the
place
of
my
destination
as
quickly
as
i
intended
when
i
did
i
found
the
house
dark
and
the
silence
sepulchral
but
i
did
not
turn
away
remembering
my
mother
anxiety
an
anxiety
so
extreme
it
disturbed
her
final
moments
i
approached
the
front
door
and
was
about
to
knock
when
i
found
it
open
greatly
astonished
i
at
once
passed
in
and
seeing
my
way
perfectly
in
the
moonlight
entered
the
room
on
the
left
the
door
of
which
also
stood
open
it
was
the
second
house
i
had
entered
unannounced
that
night
and
in
this
as
in
the
other
i
encountered
a
man
sitting
asleep
by
the
table
it
was
john
the
elder
of
the
two
and
perceiving
that
he
was
suffering
for
food
and
in
a
condition
of
extreme
misery
i
took
out
the
first
bill
my
hand
encountered
in
my
overfull
pockets
and
laid
it
on
the
table
by
his
side
as
i
did
so
he
gave
a
sigh
but
did
not
wake
and
satisfied
that
i
had
done
all
that
was
wise
and
all
that
even
my
mother
would
expect
of
me
under
the
circumstances
and
fearing
to
encounter
the
other
brother
if
i
lingered
i
hastened
away
and
took
the
shortest
path
home
had
i
been
more
of
a
man
or
if
my
visit
to
webb
had
been
actuated
by
a
more
communicable
motive
i
would
have
gone
at
once
to
the
good
man
who
believed
me
to
be
of
his
own
flesh
and
blood
and
told
him
of
the
strange
and
adventure
which
had
changed
the
whole
tenor
of
my
thoughts
and
life
and
begged
his
advice
as
to
what
i
had
better
do
under
the
difficult
circumstances
in
which
i
found
myself
placed
but
the
memory
of
a
thousand
past
ingratitudes
together
with
the
knowledge
of
the
shock
which
he
could
not
fail
to
receive
on
learning
at
this
late
day
and
under
conditions
at
once
so
tragic
and
full
of
menace
that
the
child
which
his
wife
had
once
placed
in
his
arms
as
his
own
was
neither
of
her
blood
nor
his
rose
up
between
us
and
caused
me
not
only
to
attempt
silence
but
to
secrete
in
the
adjoining
woods
the
money
i
had
received
in
the
vain
hope
that
all
visible
connection
between
myself
and
my
mother
tragic
death
would
thus
be
lost
you
see
i
had
not
calculated
on
miss
amabel
page
the
flash
he
here
received
from
that
lady
eyes
startled
the
crowd
and
gave
sweetwater
already
suffering
under
shock
after
shock
of
mingled
surprise
and
wonder
his
first
definite
idea
that
he
had
never
rightly
understood
the
relations
between
these
two
and
that
something
besides
justice
had
actuated
amabel
in
her
treatment
of
this
young
man
this
feeling
was
shared
by
others
and
a
reaction
set
in
in
favour
which
even
affected
the
officials
who
were
conducting
the
inquiry
this
was
shown
by
the
difference
of
manner
now
assumed
by
the
coroner
and
by
the
more
easily
impressed
sweetwater
who
had
not
yet
learned
the
indispensable
art
of
hiding
his
feelings
frederick
himself
felt
the
change
and
showed
it
by
the
look
of
relief
and
growing
confidence
he
cast
at
agnes
of
the
questions
and
answers
which
now
passed
between
him
and
the
various
members
of
the
jury
i
need
give
no
account
they
but
emphasised
facts
already
known
and
produced
but
little
change
in
the
general
feeling
which
was
now
one
of
suppressed
pity
for
all
who
had
been
drawn
into
the
meshes
of
this
tragic
mystery
when
he
was
allowed
to
resume
his
seat
the
name
of
miss
amabel
page
was
again
called
she
rose
with
a
bound
nought
that
she
had
anticipated
had
occurred
facts
of
which
she
could
know
nothing
had
changed
the
aspect
of
affairs
and
made
the
position
of
frederick
something
so
remote
from
any
she
could
have
imagined
that
she
was
still
in
the
maze
of
the
numberless
conflicting
emotions
which
these
revelations
were
calculated
to
call
out
in
one
who
had
risked
all
on
the
hazard
of
a
die
and
lost
she
did
not
even
know
at
this
moment
whether
she
was
glad
or
sorry
he
could
explain
so
cleverly
his
anomalous
position
she
had
caught
the
look
he
had
cast
at
agnes
and
while
this
angered
her
it
did
not
greatly
modify
her
opinion
that
he
was
destined
for
herself
for
however
other
people
might
feel
she
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
his
story
she
had
not
a
pure
enough
heart
to
do
so
to
her
all
was
an
anomaly
no
woman
of
the
mental
or
physical
strength
of
agatha
webb
would
plant
a
dagger
in
her
own
breast
just
to
prevent
another
person
from
committing
a
crime
were
he
lover
husband
or
son
so
amabel
believed
and
so
would
these
others
believe
also
when
once
relieved
of
the
magnetic
personality
of
this
extraordinary
witness
yet
how
thrilling
it
had
been
to
hear
him
plead
his
cause
so
well
it
was
almost
worth
the
loss
of
her
revenge
to
meet
his
look
of
hate
and
dream
of
the
possibility
of
turning
it
later
into
the
old
look
of
love
yes
yes
she
loved
him
now
not
for
his
position
for
that
was
gone
not
even
for
his
money
for
she
could
contemplate
its
loss
but
for
himself
who
had
so
boldly
shown
that
he
was
stronger
than
she
and
could
triumph
over
her
by
the
sheer
force
of
his
masculine
daring
with
such
feelings
what
should
she
say
to
these
men
how
conduct
herself
under
questions
which
would
be
much
more
searching
now
than
before
she
could
not
even
decide
in
her
own
mind
she
must
let
impulse
have
its
way
happily
she
took
the
right
stand
at
first
she
did
not
endeavour
to
make
any
corrections
in
her
former
testimony
only
acknowledging
that
the
flower
whose
presence
on
the
scene
of
death
had
been
such
a
mystery
had
fallen
from
her
hair
at
the
ball
and
that
she
had
seen
frederick
pick
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
buttonhole
beyond
this
and
the
inferences
it
afterward
awakened
in
her
mind
she
would
not
go
though
many
present
and
among
them
frederick
felt
confident
that
her
attitude
had
been
one
of
suspicion
from
the
first
and
that
it
was
to
follow
him
rather
than
to
supply
the
wants
of
the
old
man
zabel
she
had
left
the
ball
and
found
her
way
to
agatha
webb
cottage
xxxii
why
agatha
webb
will
never
be
forgotten
in
sutherlandtown
meanwhile
sweetwater
had
been
witness
to
a
series
of
pantomimic
actions
that
interested
him
more
than
amabel
conduct
under
this
final
examination
frederick
who
had
evidently
some
request
to
make
or
direction
to
give
had
sent
a
written
line
to
the
coroner
who
on
reading
it
had
passed
it
over
to
knapp
who
a
few
minutes
later
was
to
be
seen
in
conference
with
agnes
halliday
as
a
result
the
latter
rose
and
left
the
room
followed
by
the
detective
she
was
gone
a
then
simultaneously
with
her
reappearance
sweetwater
saw
knapp
hand
a
bundle
of
letters
to
the
coroner
who
upon
opening
them
chose
out
several
which
he
proceeded
to
read
to
the
jury
they
were
the
letters
referred
to
by
frederick
as
having
been
given
to
him
by
his
mother
the
first
was
dated
years
previously
and
was
in
the
handwriting
of
agatha
herself
it
was
directed
to
james
zabel
and
was
read
amid
a
profound
hush
dear
james
you
are
too
presumptuous
when
i
let
you
carry
me
away
from
john
in
that
maddening
reel
last
night
i
did
not
mean
you
to
draw
the
inference
you
did
that
you
did
draw
it
argues
a
touch
of
vanity
in
a
man
who
is
not
alone
in
the
field
where
he
imagines
himself
victor
john
who
is
humbler
sees
some
merit
in
well
in
frederick
snow
let
us
say
so
do
i
but
merit
does
not
always
win
any
more
than
presumption
when
we
meet
let
it
be
as
friends
but
as
friends
only
a
girl
can
not
be
driven
into
love
to
ride
on
your
big
mare
judith
is
bliss
enough
for
my
twenty
years
why
do
you
find
it
so
too
i
think
i
hear
you
say
you
do
but
only
when
she
stops
at
a
certain
gate
on
portchester
highway
folly
there
are
other
roads
and
other
gates
though
if
i
should
see
you
enter
one
there
my
pen
is
galloping
away
with
me
faster
than
judith
ever
did
and
it
is
time
i
drew
rein
present
my
regards
to
john
but
no
then
he
would
know
i
had
written
you
a
letter
and
that
might
hurt
him
how
could
he
guess
it
was
only
a
scolding
letter
such
as
it
would
grieve
him
to
receive
and
that
it
does
not
count
for
anything
were
it
to
frederick
snow
now
there
some
horses
are
so
hard
to
pull
up
and
so
are
some
pens
i
will
come
to
a
standstill
but
not
before
your
door
respectfully
your
neighbour
agatha
gilchrist
dear
james
i
know
i
have
a
temper
a
wicked
temper
and
now
you
know
it
too
when
it
is
roused
i
forget
love
gratitude
and
everything
else
that
should
restrain
me
and
utter
words
i
am
myself
astonished
at
but
i
do
not
get
roused
often
and
when
all
is
over
i
am
not
averse
to
apologising
or
even
to
begging
forgiveness
my
father
says
my
temper
will
undo
me
but
i
am
much
more
afraid
of
my
heart
than
i
am
of
my
temper
for
instance
here
i
am
writing
to
you
again
just
because
i
raised
my
and
said
but
you
know
what
i
said
and
i
am
not
fond
of
recalling
the
words
for
i
can
not
do
so
without
seeing
your
look
of
surprise
and
contrasting
it
with
that
of
philemon
yours
had
judgment
in
it
while
philemon
held
only
indulgence
yet
i
liked
yours
best
or
should
have
liked
it
best
if
it
were
not
for
the
insufferable
pride
which
is
a
part
of
my
being
temper
such
as
mine
ought
to
surprise
you
yet
would
i
be
agatha
gilchrist
without
it
i
very
much
fear
not
and
not
being
agatha
gilchrist
should
i
have
your
love
again
i
fear
not
james
forgive
me
when
i
am
happier
when
i
know
my
own
heart
i
will
have
less
provocation
then
if
that
heart
turns
your
way
you
will
find
a
great
and
bountiful
serenity
where
now
there
are
lowering
and
thunderous
tempests
philemon
said
last
night
that
he
would
be
content
to
have
my
fierce
word
o
mornings
if
only
i
would
give
him
one
drop
out
of
the
honey
of
my
better
nature
when
the
sun
went
down
and
twilight
brought
reflection
and
love
but
i
did
not
like
him
any
the
better
for
saying
this
you
would
not
halve
the
day
so
the
cup
with
which
you
would
refresh
yourself
must
hold
no
bitterness
will
it
not
have
to
be
proffered
then
by
other
hands
than
those
of
agatha
gilchrist
philemon
webb
respected
sir
you
are
persistent
i
am
willing
to
tell
you
though
i
shall
never
confide
so
much
to
another
that
it
will
take
a
stronger
nature
than
yours
and
one
that
loves
me
less
to
hold
me
faithful
and
make
me
the
happy
devoted
wife
which
i
must
be
if
i
would
not
be
a
demon
i
can
not
i
dare
not
marry
where
i
am
not
held
in
a
passionate
subjection
i
am
too
proud
too
sensitive
too
little
mistress
of
myself
when
angry
or
aroused
if
like
some
strong
women
i
loved
what
was
weaker
than
myself
and
could
be
controlled
by
goodness
and
unlimited
kindness
i
might
venture
to
risk
living
at
the
side
of
the
most
indulgent
and
upright
man
i
know
but
i
am
not
of
that
kind
strength
only
can
command
my
admiration
or
subdue
my
pride
i
must
fear
where
i
love
and
own
for
husband
him
who
has
first
shown
himself
my
master
so
do
not
fret
any
more
for
me
for
you
less
than
any
man
i
know
will
ever
claim
my
obedience
or
command
my
love
not
that
i
will
not
yield
my
heart
to
you
but
that
i
can
not
and
knowing
that
i
can
not
feel
it
honest
to
say
so
before
any
more
of
your
fine
young
manhood
is
wasted
go
your
ways
then
philemon
and
leave
me
to
the
rougher
paths
my
feet
were
made
to
tread
i
like
you
now
and
feel
something
like
a
tender
regard
for
your
goodness
but
if
you
persist
in
a
courtship
which
only
my
father
is
inclined
to
smile
upon
you
will
call
up
an
antagonism
that
can
lead
to
nothing
but
evil
for
the
serpent
that
lies
coiled
in
my
breast
has
deadly
fangs
and
is
to
be
feared
as
you
should
know
who
have
more
than
once
seen
me
angry
do
not
blame
john
or
james
zabel
or
frederick
snow
or
even
samuel
barton
for
this
it
would
be
the
same
if
none
of
these
men
existed
i
was
not
made
to
triumph
over
a
kindly
nature
but
to
yield
the
haughtiest
heart
in
all
this
county
to
the
gentle
but
firm
control
of
its
natural
master
do
you
want
to
know
who
that
master
is
i
can
not
tell
you
for
i
have
not
yet
named
him
to
myself
dear
james
i
am
going
away
i
am
going
to
leave
portchester
for
several
months
i
am
going
to
see
the
world
i
did
not
tell
you
this
last
night
for
fear
of
weakening
under
your
entreaties
or
should
i
say
commands
lately
i
have
felt
myself
weakening
more
than
once
and
i
want
to
know
what
it
means
absence
will
teach
me
absence
and
the
sight
of
new
faces
do
you
quarrel
with
this
necessity
do
you
think
i
should
know
my
mind
without
any
such
test
alas
james
it
is
not
a
simple
mind
and
it
baffles
me
at
times
let
us
then
give
it
a
chance
if
the
glow
and
glamour
of
elegant
city
life
can
make
me
forget
certain
snatches
of
talk
at
our
old
gate
or
that
night
when
you
drew
my
hand
through
your
arm
and
softly
kissed
my
fingertips
then
i
am
no
mate
for
you
whose
love
however
critical
has
never
wavered
but
has
made
itself
felt
even
in
rebuke
as
the
strongest
sweetest
thing
that
has
entered
my
turbulent
life
because
i
would
be
worthy
of
you
i
submit
to
a
separation
which
will
either
be
a
permanent
one
or
the
last
that
will
ever
take
place
between
you
and
me
john
will
not
bear
this
as
well
as
you
yet
he
does
not
love
me
as
well
possibly
because
to
him
i
am
simply
a
superior
being
while
to
you
i
am
a
loving
but
imperfect
woman
who
wishes
to
do
right
but
can
only
do
so
under
the
highest
guidance
dear
john
i
feel
that
i
owe
you
a
letter
because
you
have
been
so
patient
you
may
show
it
to
james
if
you
like
but
i
mean
it
for
you
as
an
old
and
dear
friend
who
will
one
day
dance
at
my
wedding
i
am
living
in
a
whirl
of
enjoyment
i
am
seeing
and
tasting
of
pleasures
i
have
only
dreamed
about
till
now
from
a
farmhouse
kitchen
to
andrews
is
a
lively
change
for
a
girl
who
loves
dress
and
show
only
less
than
daily
intercourse
with
famous
men
and
brilliant
women
but
i
am
bearing
it
nobly
and
have
developed
tastes
i
did
not
know
i
possessed
expensive
tastes
john
which
i
fear
may
unfit
me
for
the
humble
life
of
a
portchester
matron
can
you
imagine
me
dressed
in
rich
brocade
sitting
in
the
midst
of
washington
choicest
citizens
and
exchanging
sallies
with
senators
and
judges
you
may
find
it
hard
yet
so
it
is
and
no
one
seems
to
think
i
am
out
of
place
nor
do
i
feel
so
only
do
not
tell
james
there
are
movements
in
my
heart
at
times
which
make
me
shut
my
eyes
when
the
lights
are
brightest
and
dream
if
but
for
an
instant
of
home
and
the
gateway
where
i
have
so
often
leaned
when
someone
you
know
who
it
is
now
john
and
i
shall
not
hurt
you
too
deeply
by
mentioning
him
was
saying
and
calling
down
the
blessings
of
heaven
upon
a
head
not
worthy
to
receive
them
does
this
argue
my
speedy
return
perhaps
yet
i
do
not
know
there
are
fond
hearts
here
also
and
a
life
in
this
country
centre
would
be
a
great
life
for
me
if
only
i
could
forget
the
touch
of
a
certain
restraining
hand
which
has
great
power
over
me
even
as
a
memory
for
the
sake
of
that
touch
shall
i
give
up
the
grandeur
and
charm
of
this
broad
life
answer
john
you
know
him
and
me
well
enough
now
to
say
dear
john
i
do
not
understand
your
letter
you
speak
in
affectionate
terms
of
everybody
yet
you
beg
me
to
wait
and
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
return
why
do
you
not
realise
that
such
words
only
make
me
the
more
anxious
to
see
old
portchester
again
if
there
is
anything
amiss
at
home
or
if
james
is
learning
to
do
without
me
but
you
do
not
say
that
you
only
intimate
that
perhaps
i
will
be
better
able
to
make
up
my
mind
later
than
now
and
hint
of
great
things
to
come
if
i
will
only
hold
my
affections
in
check
a
little
longer
this
is
all
very
ambiguous
and
demands
a
fuller
explanation
so
write
to
me
once
more
john
or
i
shall
sever
every
engagement
i
have
made
here
and
return
dear
john
your
letter
is
plain
enough
this
time
james
read
the
letter
i
wrote
you
about
my
pleasure
in
the
life
here
and
was
displeased
at
it
he
thinks
i
am
growing
worldly
and
losing
that
simplicity
which
he
has
always
looked
upon
as
my
most
attractive
characteristic
so
so
well
james
is
right
i
am
becoming
less
the
country
girl
and
more
the
woman
of
the
world
every
day
i
remain
here
that
means
i
am
becoming
less
worthy
of
him
so
but
whatever
else
i
have
to
say
on
this
topic
must
be
said
to
him
for
this
you
will
pardon
me
like
the
good
brother
you
are
i
can
not
help
my
preference
he
is
nearer
my
own
age
besides
we
were
made
for
each
other
dear
james
i
am
not
worldly
i
am
not
carried
away
by
the
pleasures
and
satisfactions
of
this
place
at
least
not
to
the
point
of
forgetting
what
is
dearer
and
better
i
have
seen
washington
i
have
seen
gay
life
i
like
it
but
i
love
portchester
consequently
i
am
going
to
return
to
portchester
and
that
very
soon
indeed
i
can
not
stay
away
much
longer
and
if
you
are
glad
of
this
and
if
you
wish
to
be
convinced
that
a
girl
who
has
been
wearing
brocade
and
jewels
can
content
herself
quite
gaily
again
with
calico
come
up
to
the
dear
old
gate
a
week
from
now
and
you
will
have
the
opportunity
do
you
object
to
flowers
i
may
wear
a
flower
in
my
hair
your
wayward
but
agatha
dear
james
why
must
i
write
why
am
i
not
content
with
the
memory
of
last
night
when
one
cup
is
quite
full
a
cup
that
has
been
so
long
in
filling
must
some
few
drops
escape
just
to
show
that
a
great
joy
like
mine
is
not
satisfied
to
be
simply
quiescent
i
have
suffered
so
long
from
uncertainty
have
tried
you
and
tried
myself
with
so
tedious
an
indecision
that
now
i
know
no
other
man
can
ever
move
my
heart
as
you
have
done
the
ecstasy
of
it
makes
me
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
love
you
that
i
do
not
simply
accept
your
love
but
give
you
back
in
fullest
measure
all
the
devotion
you
have
heaped
upon
me
in
spite
of
my
many
faults
and
failings
you
took
me
to
your
heart
last
night
and
seemed
satisfied
but
it
does
not
satisfy
me
that
i
just
let
you
do
it
without
telling
you
that
i
am
proud
and
happy
to
be
the
chosen
one
of
your
heart
and
that
as
i
saw
your
smile
and
the
proud
passion
which
lit
up
your
face
i
felt
how
much
sweeter
was
the
dear
domestic
bliss
you
promised
me
than
the
more
brilliant
but
colder
life
of
a
statesman
wife
in
washington
i
missed
the
flower
from
my
hair
when
i
went
back
to
my
room
last
night
did
you
take
it
dear
if
so
do
not
cherish
it
i
hate
to
think
of
anything
withering
on
your
breast
my
love
is
deathless
james
and
owns
no
such
symbol
as
that
but
perhaps
you
are
not
thinking
of
my
love
but
of
my
faults
if
so
let
the
flower
remain
where
you
have
put
it
and
when
you
gaze
on
it
say
thus
is
it
with
the
defects
of
my
darling
once
in
full
bloom
now
a
withered
remembrance
when
i
gathered
her
they
began
to
fade
o
james
i
feel
as
if
i
never
could
feel
anger
again
dear
james
i
do
not
i
can
not
believe
it
though
you
said
to
me
on
going
out
your
father
will
explain
i
can
not
content
myself
with
his
explanations
and
will
never
believe
what
he
said
of
you
except
you
confirm
his
accusations
by
your
own
act
if
after
i
have
told
you
exactly
what
passed
between
us
you
return
me
this
and
other
letters
then
i
shall
know
that
i
have
leaned
my
weight
on
a
hollow
staff
and
that
henceforth
i
am
to
be
without
protector
or
comforter
in
this
world
o
james
were
we
not
happy
i
believed
in
you
and
felt
that
you
believed
in
me
when
we
stood
heart
to
heart
under
the
elm
tree
was
it
only
last
night
and
you
swore
that
if
it
lay
in
the
power
of
earthly
man
to
make
me
happy
i
should
taste
every
sweet
that
a
woman
heart
naturally
craved
i
thought
my
heaven
had
already
come
and
that
now
it
only
remained
for
me
to
create
yours
yet
that
very
minute
my
father
was
approaching
us
and
in
another
instant
we
heard
these
words
james
i
must
talk
with
you
before
you
make
my
daughter
forget
herself
any
further
forget
herself
what
had
happened
this
was
not
the
way
my
father
had
been
accustomed
to
talk
much
as
he
had
always
favoured
the
suit
of
philemon
webb
and
pleased
as
he
would
have
been
had
my
choice
fallen
on
him
forget
herself
i
looked
at
you
to
see
how
these
insulting
words
would
affect
you
but
while
you
turned
pale
or
seemed
to
do
so
in
the
fading
moonlight
you
were
not
quite
so
unprepared
for
them
as
i
was
myself
and
instead
of
showing
anger
followed
my
father
into
the
house
leaving
me
shivering
in
a
spot
which
had
held
no
chill
for
me
a
moment
before
you
were
gone
how
long
to
me
it
seemed
an
hour
and
perhaps
it
was
it
would
seem
to
take
that
long
for
a
face
to
show
such
change
as
yours
did
when
you
confronted
me
again
in
the
moonlight
yet
a
lightning
stroke
makes
quick
work
and
perhaps
my
countenance
in
that
one
minute
showed
as
great
a
change
as
yours
else
why
did
you
shudder
away
from
me
and
to
my
passionate
appeal
reply
with
this
one
short
phrase
your
father
will
explain
did
you
think
any
other
words
than
yours
would
satisfy
me
or
that
i
could
believe
even
him
when
he
accused
you
of
a
base
and
dishonest
act
much
as
i
have
always
loved
and
revered
my
father
i
find
it
impossible
not
to
hope
that
in
his
wish
to
see
me
united
to
philemon
he
has
resorted
to
an
unworthy
subterfuge
to
separate
us
therefore
i
give
you
our
interview
word
for
word
may
it
shock
you
as
much
as
it
shocked
me
here
is
what
he
said
first
agatha
you
can
not
marry
james
zabel
he
is
not
an
honest
man
he
has
defrauded
me
me
your
father
of
several
thousand
dollars
in
a
clever
way
too
showing
him
to
be
as
subtle
as
he
is
unprincipled
shall
i
tell
you
the
wretched
story
my
girl
he
has
left
me
to
do
so
he
sees
as
plainly
as
i
do
that
any
communication
between
you
two
after
the
discovery
i
have
this
day
made
would
be
but
an
added
offence
he
is
at
least
a
gentleman
which
is
something
considering
how
near
he
came
to
being
my
i
may
have
answered
people
do
cry
out
when
they
are
stabbed
sometimes
but
i
rather
think
i
did
not
say
a
word
only
looked
a
disdain
which
at
that
minute
was
as
measureless
as
my
belief
in
you
you
dishonest
you
or
perhaps
i
laughed
that
would
have
been
truer
to
my
feeling
yes
i
must
have
laughed
my
father
next
words
indicated
that
i
did
something
you
do
not
believe
in
his
guilt
he
went
on
and
there
was
a
kindness
in
his
tone
which
gave
me
my
first
feeling
of
real
terror
i
can
readily
comprehend
that
agatha
he
has
been
in
my
office
and
acted
under
my
eye
for
several
years
now
and
i
had
almost
as
much
confidence
in
him
as
you
had
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
i
liked
him
much
better
as
my
confidential
clerk
than
as
your
probable
or
prospective
husband
he
has
never
held
the
key
to
my
heart
would
god
he
never
had
to
yours
but
he
was
a
good
and
reliable
man
in
the
office
or
so
i
thought
and
i
gave
into
his
hand
much
of
the
work
i
ought
to
have
done
myself
especially
since
my
health
has
more
or
less
failed
me
my
trust
he
abused
a
month
ago
it
was
during
that
ill
turn
you
remember
i
received
a
letter
from
a
man
i
had
never
expected
to
hear
from
again
he
was
in
my
debt
some
ten
thousand
dollars
and
wrote
that
he
had
brought
with
him
as
much
of
this
sum
as
he
had
been
able
to
save
in
the
last
five
years
to
sutherlandtown
where
he
was
now
laid
up
with
a
dangerous
illness
from
which
he
had
small
hope
of
recovering
would
i
come
there
and
get
it
he
was
a
stranger
and
wished
to
take
no
one
into
his
confidence
but
he
had
the
money
and
would
be
glad
to
place
it
in
my
hands
he
added
that
as
he
was
a
lone
man
without
friends
or
relatives
to
inherit
from
him
he
felt
a
decided
pleasure
at
the
prospect
of
satisfying
his
only
creditor
and
devoutly
hoped
he
would
be
well
enough
to
realise
the
transaction
and
receive
my
receipt
but
if
his
fever
increased
and
he
should
be
delirious
or
unconscious
when
i
reached
him
then
i
was
to
lift
up
the
corner
of
the
mattress
on
which
he
lay
and
take
from
underneath
his
head
a
black
wallet
in
which
i
would
find
the
money
promised
me
he
had
elsewhere
enough
to
pay
all
his
expenses
so
that
the
full
contents
of
the
wallet
were
mine
i
remembered
the
man
and
i
wanted
the
money
so
not
being
able
to
go
for
it
myself
i
authorised
james
zabel
to
collect
it
for
me
he
started
at
once
for
sutherlandtown
and
in
a
few
hours
returned
with
the
wallet
alluded
to
though
i
was
suffering
intensely
at
the
time
i
remember
distinctly
the
air
with
which
he
laid
it
down
and
the
words
with
which
he
endeavoured
to
carry
off
a
certain
secret
excitement
visible
in
him
orr
was
alive
sir
and
fully
conscious
but
he
will
not
outlive
the
night
he
seemed
quite
satisfied
with
the
messenger
and
gave
up
the
wallet
without
any
hesitation
i
roused
up
and
looked
at
him
has
shaken
you
up
so
i
asked
he
was
silent
a
moment
before
replying
have
ridden
fast
said
he
then
more
slowly
feels
sorry
for
a
man
dying
alone
and
amongst
strangers
i
thought
he
showed
an
unnecessary
emotion
but
paid
no
further
heed
to
it
at
the
time
the
wallet
held
two
thousand
and
more
dollars
which
was
less
than
i
expected
but
yet
a
goodly
sum
and
very
welcome
as
i
was
counting
it
over
i
glanced
at
the
paper
accompanying
it
it
was
an
acknowledgment
of
debt
and
mentioned
the
exact
sum
i
should
find
in
the
wallet
pointing
them
out
to
james
i
remarked
figures
are
in
different
ink
from
the
words
how
do
you
account
for
that
i
thought
his
answer
rather
long
in
coming
though
when
it
did
come
it
was
calm
if
not
studied
presume
said
he
the
sum
was
inserted
at
sutherlandtown
after
orr
was
quite
sure
just
how
much
he
could
spare
for
the
liquidation
of
this
old
debt
likely
i
assented
not
bestowing
another
thought
upon
the
matter
but
it
has
been
forced
back
upon
my
attention
in
a
curious
if
not
providential
way
i
was
over
in
sutherlandtown
for
the
first
time
since
my
illness
and
having
some
curiosity
about
my
unfortunate
but
honest
debtor
went
to
the
hotel
and
asked
to
see
the
room
in
which
he
died
it
being
empty
they
at
once
showed
it
to
me
and
satisfied
that
he
had
been
made
comfortable
in
his
last
hours
i
was
turning
away
when
i
espied
on
a
table
in
one
corner
an
inkstand
and
what
seemed
to
be
an
old
why
i
stopped
and
approached
this
table
i
do
not
know
but
once
in
front
of
it
i
remembered
what
zabel
had
said
about
the
figures
and
taking
up
the
pen
i
saw
there
i
dipped
it
in
the
and
attempted
to
scribble
a
number
or
two
on
a
piece
of
loose
paper
i
found
in
the
the
ink
was
thick
and
the
pen
corroded
so
that
it
was
not
till
after
several
ineffectual
efforts
that
i
succeeded
in
making
any
strokes
that
were
at
all
legible
but
when
i
did
they
were
so
exactly
similar
in
colour
to
the
numbers
inserted
in
memorandum
which
i
had
fortunately
brought
with
me
that
i
was
instantly
satisfied
this
especial
portion
of
the
writing
had
been
done
as
james
had
said
in
this
room
and
with
the
very
pen
i
was
then
handling
as
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
in
this
i
was
turning
away
when
a
gust
of
wind
from
the
open
window
lifted
the
loose
sheet
of
paper
i
had
been
scribbling
on
and
landed
it
the
other
side
up
on
the
carpet
as
i
stooped
for
it
i
saw
figures
on
it
and
feeling
sure
that
they
had
been
scrawled
there
by
orr
in
his
attempt
to
make
the
pen
write
i
pulled
out
the
memorandum
again
and
compared
the
two
minutely
they
were
the
work
of
the
same
hand
but
the
figures
on
the
stray
leaf
differed
from
those
in
the
memorandum
in
a
very
important
particular
those
in
the
memorandum
began
with
a
while
those
on
the
stray
sheet
began
with
a
a
striking
difference
look
agatha
here
is
the
piece
of
paper
just
as
i
found
it
you
see
here
there
and
everywhere
the
one
set
of
figures
here
it
is
hardly
legible
here
it
is
blotted
with
too
much
ink
here
it
is
faint
but
sufficiently
distinct
and
here
well
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
these
figures
yet
the
memorandum
reads
and
the
money
returned
to
me
amounts
to
a
clean
five
thousand
dollars
difference
here
james
my
father
paused
perhaps
to
give
me
a
commiserating
look
though
i
did
not
need
it
perhaps
to
give
himself
a
moment
in
which
to
regain
courage
for
what
he
still
had
to
say
i
did
not
break
the
silence
i
was
too
sure
of
your
integrity
besides
my
tongue
could
not
have
moved
if
it
would
all
my
faculties
seemed
frozen
except
that
instinct
which
cried
out
continually
within
me
no
there
is
no
fault
in
james
he
has
done
no
wrong
no
one
but
himself
shall
ever
convince
me
that
he
has
robbed
anyone
of
anything
except
poor
me
of
my
poor
heart
but
inner
cries
of
this
kind
are
inaudible
and
after
a
interval
my
father
went
on
five
thousand
dollars
is
no
petty
sum
and
the
discrepancy
in
the
two
sets
of
figures
which
seemed
to
involve
me
in
so
considerable
a
loss
set
me
thinking
convinced
that
orr
would
not
be
likely
to
scribble
one
number
over
so
many
times
if
it
was
not
the
one
then
in
his
mind
i
went
to
forsyth
office
and
borrowed
a
through
which
i
again
subjected
the
figures
in
the
memorandum
to
a
rigid
scrutiny
the
result
was
a
positive
conviction
that
they
had
been
tampered
with
after
their
first
writing
either
by
orr
himself
or
by
another
whom
i
need
not
name
the
had
originally
been
a
and
i
could
even
see
where
the
top
line
of
the
had
been
given
a
curl
and
where
a
horizontal
stroke
had
been
added
at
the
bottom
agatha
i
came
home
as
troubled
a
man
as
there
was
in
all
these
parts
i
remembered
the
suppressed
excitement
which
had
been
in
james
face
when
he
handed
me
over
the
money
and
i
remembered
also
that
you
loved
him
or
thought
you
did
and
that
love
or
no
love
you
were
pledged
to
marry
him
if
i
had
not
recalled
all
this
i
might
have
proceeded
more
warily
as
it
was
i
took
the
bold
and
open
course
and
gave
james
zabel
an
opportunity
to
explain
himself
agatha
he
did
not
embrace
it
he
listened
to
my
accusations
and
followed
my
finger
when
i
pointed
out
the
discrepancy
between
the
two
sets
of
figures
but
he
made
no
protestations
of
innocence
nor
did
he
show
me
the
front
of
an
honest
man
when
i
asked
if
he
expected
me
to
believe
that
the
wallet
had
held
only
two
thousand
and
over
when
orr
handed
it
over
to
him
on
the
contrary
he
seemed
to
shrink
into
himself
like
a
person
whose
life
has
been
suddenly
blasted
and
replying
that
he
would
expect
me
to
believe
nothing
except
his
extreme
contrition
at
the
abuse
of
confidence
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
begged
me
to
wait
till
before
taking
any
active
steps
in
the
matter
i
replied
that
i
would
show
him
that
much
consideration
if
he
would
immediately
drop
all
pretensions
to
your
hand
this
put
him
in
a
bad
way
but
he
left
as
you
see
with
just
a
simple
injunction
to
you
to
seek
from
me
an
explanation
of
his
strange
departure
does
that
look
like
innocence
or
does
it
look
like
guilt
i
found
my
tongue
at
this
and
passionately
cried
james
zabel
life
as
i
have
known
it
shows
him
to
be
an
honest
man
if
he
has
done
what
you
suggest
given
you
but
a
portion
of
the
money
entrusted
to
him
and
altered
the
figures
in
the
memorandum
to
suit
the
amount
he
brought
you
then
there
is
a
discrepancy
between
this
act
and
all
the
other
acts
of
his
life
which
i
find
it
more
difficult
to
reconcile
than
you
did
the
two
sets
of
figures
in
orr
handwriting
father
i
must
hear
from
his
own
lips
a
confirmation
of
your
suspicions
before
i
will
credit
them
and
this
is
why
i
write
you
so
minute
an
account
of
what
passed
between
my
father
and
myself
last
night
if
his
account
of
the
matter
is
a
correct
one
and
you
have
nothing
to
add
to
it
in
way
of
explanation
then
the
return
of
this
letter
will
be
token
enough
that
my
father
has
been
just
in
his
accusations
and
that
the
bond
between
us
must
be
broken
but
if
o
james
if
you
are
the
true
man
i
consider
you
and
all
that
i
have
heard
is
a
fabrication
or
mistake
then
come
to
me
at
once
do
not
delay
but
come
at
once
and
the
sight
of
your
face
at
the
gate
will
be
enough
to
establish
your
innocence
in
my
eyes
agatha
the
letter
that
followed
this
was
very
short
dear
james
the
package
of
letters
has
been
received
god
help
me
to
bear
this
shock
to
all
my
hopes
and
the
death
of
all
my
girlish
beliefs
i
am
not
angry
only
those
who
have
something
left
to
hold
on
to
in
life
can
be
angry
my
father
tells
me
he
has
received
a
packet
too
it
contained
five
thousand
dollars
in
ten
notes
james
james
was
not
my
love
enough
that
you
should
want
my
father
money
too
i
have
begged
my
father
and
he
has
promised
me
to
keep
the
cause
of
this
rupture
secret
no
one
shall
know
from
either
of
us
that
james
zabel
has
any
flaw
in
his
nature
the
next
letter
was
dated
some
months
later
it
is
to
philemon
dear
philemon
the
gloves
are
too
small
besides
i
never
wear
gloves
i
hate
their
restraint
and
do
not
feel
there
is
any
good
reason
for
hiding
my
hands
in
this
little
country
town
where
everyone
knows
me
why
not
give
them
to
hattie
weller
she
likes
such
things
while
i
have
had
my
fill
of
finery
a
girl
whose
one
duty
is
to
care
for
a
dying
father
has
no
room
left
in
her
heart
for
vanities
dear
philemon
it
is
impossible
i
have
had
my
day
of
love
and
my
heart
is
quite
dead
show
your
magnanimity
by
ceasing
to
urge
me
any
longer
to
forget
the
past
it
is
all
you
can
do
for
agatha
dear
philemon
you
will
have
my
hand
though
i
have
told
you
that
my
heart
does
not
go
with
it
it
is
hard
to
understand
such
persistence
but
if
you
are
satisfied
to
take
a
woman
of
my
strength
against
her
will
then
god
have
mercy
upon
you
for
i
will
be
your
wife
but
do
not
ask
me
to
go
to
sutherlandtown
i
will
live
here
and
do
not
expect
to
keep
up
your
intimacy
with
the
zabels
there
is
no
tie
of
affection
remaining
between
james
and
myself
but
if
i
am
to
shed
that
over
your
home
which
is
all
i
can
promise
and
all
that
you
can
hope
to
receive
then
keep
me
from
all
influence
but
your
own
that
this
in
time
may
grow
sweet
and
dear
to
me
is
my
earnest
prayer
for
you
are
worthy
of
a
true
wife
agatha
dear
john
i
am
going
to
be
married
my
father
exacts
it
and
there
is
no
good
reason
why
i
should
not
give
him
this
final
satisfaction
at
least
i
do
not
think
there
is
but
if
you
or
your
brother
differ
from
me
say
to
james
from
me
i
pray
that
his
life
may
be
peaceful
i
know
that
it
will
be
honest
agatha
dear
philemon
my
father
is
worse
he
fears
that
if
we
wait
till
tuesday
he
will
not
be
able
to
see
us
married
decide
then
what
our
duty
is
i
am
ready
to
abide
by
your
pleasure
agatha
the
following
is
from
john
zabel
to
his
brother
james
and
is
dated
one
day
after
the
above
dear
james
when
you
read
this
i
will
be
far
away
never
to
look
in
your
face
again
unless
you
bid
me
brother
brother
i
meant
it
for
the
best
but
god
was
not
with
me
and
i
have
made
four
hearts
miserable
without
giving
help
to
anyone
when
i
read
agatha
letter
the
last
for
more
reasons
than
one
that
i
shall
ever
receive
from
her
i
seemed
to
feel
as
never
before
what
i
had
done
to
blast
your
two
lives
for
the
first
time
i
realised
to
the
full
that
but
for
me
she
might
have
been
happy
and
you
the
respected
husband
of
the
one
grand
woman
to
be
found
in
portchester
that
i
had
loved
her
so
fiercely
myself
came
back
to
me
in
reproach
and
the
thought
that
she
perhaps
suspected
that
the
blame
had
fallen
where
it
was
not
deserved
roused
me
to
such
a
pitch
that
i
took
the
sudden
and
desperate
resolution
of
telling
her
the
truth
before
she
gave
her
hand
to
philemon
why
the
daily
sight
of
your
misery
should
not
have
driven
me
before
to
this
act
i
can
not
tell
some
remnants
of
the
old
jealousy
may
have
been
still
festering
in
my
heart
or
the
sense
of
the
great
distance
between
your
spirit
and
the
selfishness
of
my
weaker
nature
risen
like
a
barrier
between
me
and
the
only
noble
act
left
for
a
man
in
my
position
whatever
the
cause
it
was
not
till
the
full
determination
came
to
brave
the
obloquy
of
a
full
confession
but
when
it
did
come
i
did
not
pause
till
i
reached
gilchrist
house
and
was
ushered
into
his
presence
he
was
lying
on
the
lounge
looking
very
weak
and
exhausted
while
on
one
side
of
him
stood
agatha
and
on
the
other
philemon
both
contemplating
him
with
anxiety
i
had
not
expected
to
find
philemon
there
and
for
a
moment
i
suffered
the
extreme
agony
of
a
man
who
has
not
measured
the
depth
of
the
plunge
he
is
about
to
take
but
the
sight
of
agatha
trembling
under
the
shock
of
my
unexpected
presence
restored
me
to
myself
and
gave
me
firmness
to
proceed
advancing
with
a
bow
i
spoke
quickly
the
one
word
i
had
come
there
to
say
agatha
i
have
done
you
a
great
wrong
and
i
am
here
to
undo
it
for
months
i
have
felt
driven
to
confession
but
not
till
have
i
possessed
the
necessary
courage
now
nothing
shall
hinder
me
i
said
this
because
i
saw
in
both
gilchrist
and
philemon
a
disposition
to
stop
me
where
i
was
indeed
gilchrist
had
risen
on
his
elbow
and
philemon
was
making
that
pleading
gesture
of
his
which
we
know
so
well
agatha
alone
looked
eager
what
is
it
she
cried
i
have
a
right
to
know
i
went
to
the
door
shut
it
and
stood
with
my
back
against
it
a
figure
of
shame
and
despair
suddenly
the
confession
burst
from
me
agatha
said
i
why
did
you
break
with
my
brother
james
because
you
thought
him
guilty
of
theft
because
you
believed
he
took
the
five
thousand
dollars
out
of
the
sum
entrusted
to
him
by
orr
for
your
father
agatha
it
was
not
james
who
did
this
it
was
i
and
james
knew
it
and
bore
the
blame
of
my
misdoing
because
he
was
always
a
loyal
soul
and
took
account
of
my
weakness
and
knew
alas
too
well
that
open
shame
would
kill
me
it
was
a
weak
plea
and
merited
no
reply
but
the
silence
was
so
dreadful
and
lasted
so
long
that
i
felt
first
crushed
and
then
terrified
raising
my
head
for
i
had
not
dared
to
look
any
of
them
in
the
face
i
cast
one
glance
at
the
group
before
me
and
dropped
my
head
again
startled
only
one
of
the
three
was
looking
at
me
and
that
was
agatha
the
others
had
their
heads
turned
aside
and
i
thought
or
rather
the
passing
fancy
took
me
that
they
shrank
from
meeting
her
gaze
with
something
of
the
same
shame
and
dread
i
myself
felt
but
she
can
i
ever
hope
to
make
you
realise
her
look
or
comprehend
the
pang
of
utter
with
which
i
succumbed
before
it
it
was
so
terrible
that
i
seemed
to
hear
her
utter
words
though
i
am
sure
she
did
not
speak
and
with
some
wild
idea
of
stemming
the
torrent
of
her
reproaches
i
made
an
effort
at
explanation
and
impetuously
cried
it
was
not
for
my
own
good
agatha
not
for
self
altogether
i
did
this
i
too
loved
you
madly
despairingly
and
good
brother
as
i
seemed
i
was
jealous
of
james
and
hoped
to
take
his
place
in
your
regard
if
i
could
show
a
greater
prosperity
and
get
for
you
those
things
his
limited
prospects
denied
him
you
enjoy
money
beauty
ease
i
could
see
that
by
your
letters
and
if
james
could
not
give
them
to
you
and
i
could
oh
do
not
look
at
me
like
that
i
see
now
that
millions
could
not
have
bought
you
despicable
was
all
that
came
from
her
lips
at
which
i
shuddered
and
groped
about
for
the
handle
of
the
door
but
she
would
not
let
me
go
subduing
with
an
unexpected
grand
the
emotions
which
had
hitherto
swelled
too
high
in
her
breast
for
either
speech
or
action
she
thrust
out
one
arm
to
stay
me
and
said
in
short
commanding
tones
how
was
this
thing
done
you
say
you
took
the
money
yet
it
was
james
who
was
sent
to
collect
it
or
so
my
father
says
here
she
tore
her
looks
from
me
and
cast
one
glance
at
her
father
what
she
saw
i
can
not
say
but
her
manner
changed
and
henceforth
she
glanced
his
way
as
much
as
mine
and
with
nearly
as
much
emotion
i
am
waiting
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
she
exclaimed
laying
her
hand
on
the
door
over
my
head
so
as
to
leave
me
no
opportunity
for
escape
i
bowed
and
attempted
an
explanation
agatha
said
i
the
commission
was
given
to
james
and
he
rode
to
sutherlandtown
to
perform
it
but
it
was
on
the
day
when
he
was
accustomed
to
write
to
you
and
he
was
not
easy
in
his
mind
for
he
feared
he
would
miss
sending
you
his
usual
letter
when
therefore
he
came
to
the
hotel
and
saw
me
in
philemon
room
i
was
often
there
in
those
days
often
without
philemon
knowing
it
he
saw
or
thought
he
did
a
way
out
of
his
difficulties
entering
where
i
was
he
explained
to
me
his
errand
and
we
being
then
though
never
alas
since
one
in
everything
but
the
secret
hopes
he
enjoyed
he
asked
me
if
i
would
go
in
his
stead
to
orr
room
present
my
credentials
and
obtain
the
money
while
he
wrote
the
letter
with
which
his
mind
was
full
though
my
jealousy
was
aroused
and
i
hated
the
letter
he
was
about
to
write
i
did
not
see
how
i
could
refuse
him
so
after
receiving
such
credentials
as
he
himself
carried
and
getting
full
instructions
how
to
proceed
i
left
him
writing
at
philemon
table
and
hastened
down
the
hall
to
the
door
he
had
pointed
out
if
providence
had
been
on
the
side
of
guilt
the
circumstances
could
not
have
been
more
favourable
for
the
deception
i
afterwards
played
no
one
was
in
the
hall
no
one
was
with
orr
to
note
that
it
was
i
instead
of
james
who
executed
commission
but
i
was
thinking
of
no
deception
then
i
proceeded
quite
innocently
on
my
errand
and
when
the
feeble
voice
of
the
invalid
bade
me
enter
i
experienced
nothing
but
a
feeling
of
compassion
for
a
man
dying
in
this
desolate
way
alone
of
course
orr
was
surprised
to
see
a
stranger
but
after
reading
gilchrist
letter
which
i
handed
him
he
seemed
quite
satisfied
and
himself
drew
out
the
wallet
at
the
head
of
his
bed
and
handed
it
over
will
find
said
he
memorandum
inside
of
the
full
amount
i
should
like
to
have
returned
gilchrist
the
full
ten
thousand
which
i
owe
him
but
this
is
all
i
possess
barring
a
hundred
dollars
which
i
have
kept
for
my
final
expenses
gilchrist
will
be
satisfied
i
assured
him
i
make
you
out
a
receipt
he
shook
his
head
with
a
sad
smile
shall
be
dead
in
hours
what
good
will
a
receipt
do
me
but
it
seemed
unbusinesslike
not
to
give
it
so
i
went
over
to
the
table
where
i
saw
a
pen
and
paper
and
recognising
the
necessity
of
counting
the
money
before
writing
a
receipt
i
ran
my
eye
over
the
bills
which
were
large
and
found
the
wallet
contained
just
the
amount
he
had
named
then
i
glanced
at
the
memorandum
it
had
evidently
been
made
out
by
him
at
some
previous
time
for
the
body
of
the
writing
was
in
firm
characters
and
the
ink
blue
while
the
figures
were
faintly
inscribed
in
muddy
black
the
especially
was
little
more
than
a
straight
line
and
as
i
looked
at
it
the
devil
that
is
in
every
man
nature
whispered
at
first
carelessly
then
with
deeper
and
deeper
insistence
easy
it
would
be
to
change
that
to
a
only
a
little
mark
at
the
top
and
the
least
additional
stroke
at
the
bottom
and
these
figures
would
stand
for
five
thousand
less
it
might
be
a
temptation
to
some
men
it
presently
became
a
temptation
to
me
for
glancing
furtively
up
i
discovered
that
orr
had
fallen
either
into
a
sleep
or
into
a
condition
of
insensibility
which
made
him
oblivious
to
my
movements
five
thousand
dollars
just
the
sum
of
the
ten
bills
that
made
the
bulk
of
the
amount
i
had
counted
in
this
village
and
at
my
age
this
sum
would
raise
me
at
once
to
comparative
independence
the
temptation
was
too
strong
for
resistance
i
succumbed
to
it
and
seizing
the
pen
before
me
i
made
the
fatal
marks
when
i
went
back
to
james
the
wallet
was
in
my
hand
and
the
ten
bills
in
my
breast
pocket
agatha
had
begun
to
shudder
she
shook
so
she
rattled
the
door
against
which
i
leaned
and
when
you
found
that
providence
was
not
so
much
upon
your
side
as
you
thought
when
you
saw
that
the
fraud
was
known
and
that
your
brother
was
suspected
of
it
do
i
pleaded
do
make
me
recall
that
hour
but
she
was
inexorable
recall
that
and
every
hour
she
commanded
tell
me
why
he
sacrificed
himself
why
he
sacrificed
me
to
a
cur
she
feared
her
own
tongue
she
feared
her
own
anger
and
stopped
speak
she
whispered
and
it
was
the
most
ghastly
whisper
that
ever
left
mortal
lips
i
was
but
a
foot
from
her
and
she
held
me
as
by
a
strong
enchantment
i
could
not
help
obeying
her
to
make
it
all
clear
i
pursued
i
must
go
back
to
the
time
i
rejoined
james
in
philemon
room
he
had
finished
his
letter
when
i
entered
and
was
standing
with
it
sealed
in
his
hand
i
may
have
cast
it
a
disdainful
glance
i
may
have
shown
that
i
was
no
longer
the
same
man
i
had
been
when
i
left
him
a
before
for
he
looked
curiously
at
me
for
a
moment
previous
to
saying
that
the
wallet
you
have
there
was
orr
conscious
and
did
he
give
it
to
you
himself
orr
was
conscious
i
returned
and
i
did
like
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
careful
as
i
was
to
speak
naturally
but
he
fainted
just
before
i
came
out
and
i
think
you
had
better
ask
the
clerk
as
you
go
down
to
send
someone
up
to
him
james
was
weighing
the
in
his
hand
much
do
you
think
there
is
in
here
the
debt
was
ten
thousand
i
had
turned
carelessly
away
and
was
looking
out
of
the
window
memorandum
inside
gives
the
figures
as
two
thousand
i
declared
apologises
for
not
sending
the
full
amount
he
has
it
again
i
felt
james
looking
at
me
why
could
he
see
that
guilty
wad
of
bills
lying
on
my
breast
came
you
to
read
the
memorandum
he
asked
orr
wished
me
to
i
looked
at
it
to
please
him
this
was
a
lie
the
first
i
had
ever
uttered
james
eyes
had
not
moved
said
he
little
bit
of
business
seems
to
have
disturbed
you
i
ought
to
have
attended
to
it
myself
i
am
quite
sure
i
ought
to
have
attended
to
it
myself
man
is
dying
i
muttered
escaped
a
sad
sight
be
satisfied
that
you
have
got
the
money
shall
i
post
that
letter
for
you
he
put
it
jealously
in
his
pocket
and
again
i
saw
him
look
at
me
but
he
said
nothing
more
except
that
he
repeated
that
same
phrase
ought
to
have
attended
to
it
myself
agatha
might
better
have
waited
then
he
went
out
but
i
remained
till
philemon
came
home
my
brother
and
myself
were
no
longer
companions
a
crime
divided
us
a
crime
he
could
not
suspect
yet
which
made
itself
felt
in
both
our
hearts
and
prepared
him
for
the
revelation
made
to
him
by
gilchrist
some
weeks
after
that
night
he
came
to
sutherlandtown
where
i
was
and
entered
my
bedroom
not
in
the
fraternal
way
of
the
old
days
but
as
an
elder
enters
the
presence
of
a
younger
he
said
without
any
preamble
or
preparation
are
the
five
thousand
dollars
you
kept
back
from
gilchrist
the
memorandum
said
seven
and
you
delivered
to
me
only
two
there
are
sounded
in
every
life
those
words
sounded
mine
or
would
have
if
he
had
not
immediately
added
i
knew
you
had
no
stamina
i
have
taken
your
crime
on
myself
who
am
really
to
blame
for
it
since
i
delegated
my
duty
to
another
and
you
will
only
have
to
bear
the
disgrace
of
having
james
zabel
for
a
brother
in
exchange
give
me
the
money
it
shall
be
returned
you
can
not
have
disposed
of
it
already
after
which
you
or
rather
i
will
be
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
only
a
thief
in
intent
not
in
fact
had
he
only
stopped
there
but
he
went
on
is
lost
to
me
john
in
return
be
to
me
the
brother
i
always
thought
you
up
to
the
unhappy
day
the
sin
of
achan
came
between
us
you
were
lost
to
him
it
was
all
i
heard
you
were
lost
to
him
then
if
i
acknowledged
the
crime
i
should
not
only
take
up
my
own
burden
of
disgrace
but
see
him
restored
to
his
rights
over
the
only
woman
i
had
ever
loved
the
sacrifice
was
great
and
my
virtue
was
not
equal
to
it
i
gave
him
back
the
money
but
i
did
not
offer
to
assume
the
responsibility
of
my
own
crime
and
since
in
what
a
hard
tone
she
spoke
i
have
had
to
see
philemon
gradually
assume
the
rights
james
once
enjoyed
john
she
asked
she
was
under
violent
why
do
you
come
now
i
cast
my
eyes
at
philemon
he
was
standing
as
before
with
his
eyes
turned
away
there
was
discouragement
in
his
attitude
mingled
with
a
certain
grand
patience
seeing
that
he
was
better
able
to
bear
her
loss
than
either
you
or
myself
i
said
to
her
very
low
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
the
truth
before
you
gave
your
final
word
i
am
late
but
i
would
have
been
too
late
a
week
from
now
her
hand
fell
from
the
door
but
her
eyes
remained
fixed
on
my
face
never
have
i
sustained
such
a
look
never
will
i
encounter
such
another
it
is
too
late
now
she
murmured
the
clergyman
has
just
gone
who
united
me
to
philemon
the
next
minute
her
back
was
towards
me
she
had
faced
her
father
and
her
husband
father
you
knew
this
thing
keen
sharp
incisive
the
words
rang
out
i
saw
it
in
your
face
when
he
began
to
speak
gilchrist
drooped
slightly
he
was
a
very
sick
man
and
the
scene
had
been
a
trying
one
if
i
did
was
his
low
response
it
was
but
lately
you
were
engaged
then
to
philemon
why
break
up
this
second
match
she
eyed
him
as
if
she
found
it
difficult
to
credit
her
ears
such
indifference
to
the
claims
of
innocence
was
incredible
to
her
i
saw
her
grand
profile
quiver
then
the
slow
ebbing
from
her
cheek
of
every
drop
of
blood
indignation
had
summoned
there
and
you
philemon
she
suggested
with
a
somewhat
softened
aspect
you
committed
this
wrong
ignorantly
never
having
heard
of
this
crime
you
could
not
know
on
what
false
grounds
i
had
been
separated
from
james
i
had
started
to
escape
but
stopped
just
beyond
the
threshold
of
the
door
as
she
uttered
these
words
philemon
was
not
as
ignorant
as
she
supposed
this
was
evident
from
his
attitude
and
expression
agatha
he
began
but
at
this
first
word
and
before
he
could
clasp
the
hands
held
helplessly
out
before
her
she
gave
a
great
cry
and
staggering
back
eyed
both
her
father
and
himself
in
a
frenzy
of
indignation
that
was
all
the
more
uncontrollable
from
the
superhuman
effort
which
she
had
hitherto
made
to
suppress
it
you
too
she
shrieked
you
too
and
i
have
just
sworn
to
love
honour
and
obey
you
love
you
honour
you
the
unconscionable
wretch
who
but
here
gilchrist
rose
weak
tottering
quivering
with
something
more
than
anger
he
approached
his
daughter
and
laid
his
finger
on
her
lips
be
quiet
he
said
philemon
is
not
to
blame
a
month
ago
he
came
to
me
and
prayed
that
as
a
relief
to
his
mind
i
would
tell
him
why
you
had
separated
yourself
from
james
he
had
always
thought
the
match
had
fallen
through
on
account
of
some
foolish
quarrel
or
incompatibility
but
lately
he
had
feared
there
was
something
more
than
he
suspected
in
this
break
something
that
he
should
know
so
i
told
him
why
you
had
dismissed
james
and
whether
he
knew
james
better
than
we
did
or
whether
he
had
seen
something
in
his
long
acquaintance
with
these
brothers
which
influenced
his
judgment
he
said
at
once
can
not
be
true
of
james
it
is
not
in
his
nature
to
defraud
any
man
but
john
i
might
believe
it
of
john
is
there
some
complication
here
i
had
never
thought
of
john
and
did
not
see
how
john
could
be
mixed
up
with
an
affair
i
had
supposed
to
be
a
secret
between
james
and
myself
but
when
we
came
to
locate
the
day
philemon
remembered
that
on
returning
to
his
room
that
night
he
had
found
john
awaiting
him
as
his
room
was
not
five
doors
from
that
occupied
by
orr
he
was
convinced
that
there
was
more
to
this
matter
than
i
had
suspected
but
when
he
laid
the
matter
before
james
he
did
not
deny
that
john
was
guilty
but
was
peremptory
in
wishing
you
not
to
be
told
before
your
marriage
he
knew
that
you
were
engaged
to
a
good
man
a
man
that
your
father
approved
a
man
that
could
and
would
make
you
happy
he
did
not
want
to
be
the
means
of
a
second
break
and
besides
and
this
i
think
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
stand
he
took
for
james
zabel
was
always
the
proudest
man
i
ever
knew
he
never
could
bear
he
said
to
give
to
one
like
agatha
a
name
which
he
knew
and
she
knew
was
not
entirely
free
from
reproach
it
would
stand
in
the
way
of
his
happiness
and
ultimately
of
hers
his
dishonour
was
his
so
while
he
still
loved
you
his
only
prayer
was
that
after
you
were
safely
married
and
philemon
was
sure
of
your
affection
he
should
tell
you
that
the
man
you
once
regarded
so
favourably
was
not
unworthy
of
that
regard
to
obey
him
philemon
has
kept
silent
while
i
agatha
what
are
you
doing
are
you
mad
my
child
she
looked
so
for
the
moment
tearing
off
the
ring
which
she
had
worn
but
an
hour
she
flung
it
on
the
floor
then
she
threw
her
arms
high
up
over
her
head
and
burst
out
in
an
awful
voice
curses
on
the
father
curses
on
the
husband
who
have
combined
to
make
me
rue
the
day
i
was
born
the
father
i
can
not
disown
but
the
husband
hush
it
was
gilchrist
who
dared
her
fury
philemon
said
nothing
hush
he
may
be
the
father
of
your
children
do
curse
but
she
only
towered
the
higher
and
her
beauty
from
being
simply
majestic
became
appalling
children
she
cried
if
ever
i
bear
children
to
this
man
may
the
blight
of
heaven
strike
them
as
it
has
struck
me
this
day
may
they
die
as
my
hopes
have
died
or
if
they
live
may
they
bruise
his
heart
as
mine
is
bruised
and
curse
their
father
as
here
i
fled
the
house
i
was
shaking
as
if
this
awful
denunciation
had
fallen
on
my
own
head
but
before
the
door
closed
behind
me
a
different
cry
called
me
back
gilchrist
was
lying
lifeless
on
the
floor
and
philemon
the
patient
tender
philemon
had
taken
agatha
to
his
breast
and
was
soothing
her
there
as
if
the
words
she
had
showered
upon
him
had
been
blessings
instead
of
the
most
fearful
curses
which
had
ever
left
the
lips
of
mortal
woman
the
next
letter
was
in
agatha
handwriting
it
was
dated
some
months
later
and
was
stained
and
crumpled
more
than
any
other
in
the
whole
packet
could
philemon
once
have
told
why
were
these
blotted
lines
the
result
of
his
tears
falling
fast
upon
them
tears
of
forty
years
ago
when
he
and
she
were
young
and
love
had
been
doubtful
was
the
sheet
so
yellowed
and
so
seamed
because
it
had
been
worn
on
his
breast
and
folded
and
unfolded
so
often
philemon
thou
art
in
thy
grave
sleeping
sweetly
at
last
by
thy
deeply
idolised
one
but
these
marks
of
feeling
still
remain
indissolubly
connected
with
the
words
that
gave
them
birth
dear
philemon
you
are
gone
for
a
day
and
a
night
only
but
it
seems
a
lengthened
absence
to
me
meriting
a
little
letter
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
philemon
ever
since
that
dreadful
hour
following
our
marriage
that
sometimes
i
hardly
dare
yet
to
say
always
i
feel
that
i
am
beginning
to
love
you
and
that
god
did
not
deal
with
me
so
harshly
when
he
cast
me
into
your
arms
yesterday
i
tried
to
tell
you
this
when
you
almost
kissed
me
at
parting
but
i
was
afraid
it
was
a
momentary
sentimentality
and
so
kept
still
but
such
a
warm
of
joy
rises
in
my
heart
when
i
think
that
the
house
will
be
bright
again
and
that
in
place
of
the
empty
wall
opposite
me
at
table
i
shall
see
your
kindly
and
forbearing
face
i
know
that
the
heart
i
had
thought
impregnable
has
begun
to
yield
and
that
daily
gentleness
and
a
boundless
consideration
from
one
who
had
excuse
for
bitter
thoughts
and
recrimination
are
doing
what
all
of
us
thought
impossible
a
few
short
months
ago
oh
i
am
so
happy
philemon
so
happy
to
love
where
it
is
now
my
duty
to
love
and
if
it
were
not
for
that
dreadful
memory
of
a
father
dying
with
harsh
words
in
his
ears
and
the
knowledge
that
you
my
husband
yet
not
my
husband
are
bearing
ever
about
with
you
echoes
of
words
that
in
another
nature
would
have
turned
tenderness
into
gall
i
could
be
merry
also
and
sing
as
i
go
about
the
house
making
it
pleasant
and
comfortable
against
your
speedy
return
as
it
is
i
can
but
lay
my
hand
softly
on
my
heart
as
its
beatings
grow
too
impetuous
and
say
god
bless
my
absent
philemon
and
help
him
to
forgive
me
i
forgive
him
and
love
him
as
i
never
thought
i
could
that
you
may
see
that
these
are
not
the
weak
outpourings
of
a
lonely
woman
i
will
here
write
that
i
heard
that
john
and
james
zabel
have
gone
into
partnership
in
the
business
john
uncle
having
left
him
a
legacy
of
several
thousand
dollars
i
hope
they
will
do
well
james
they
say
is
full
of
business
and
is
to
all
appearance
perfectly
cheerful
this
relieves
me
from
too
much
worry
in
his
regard
god
certainly
knew
what
kind
of
a
husband
i
needed
may
you
find
yourself
equally
blessed
in
your
wife
another
letter
to
philemon
a
year
later
dear
philemon
hasten
home
philemon
i
do
not
like
these
absences
i
am
just
now
too
weak
and
fearful
since
we
knew
the
great
hope
before
us
i
have
looked
often
in
your
face
for
a
sign
that
you
remembered
what
this
hope
can
not
but
recall
to
my
shuddering
memory
philemon
philemon
was
i
mad
when
i
think
what
i
said
in
my
rage
and
then
feel
the
little
life
stirring
about
my
heart
i
wonder
that
god
did
not
strike
me
dead
rather
than
bestow
upon
me
the
greatest
blessing
that
can
come
to
woman
philemon
philemon
if
anything
should
happen
to
the
child
i
think
of
it
by
day
i
think
of
it
by
night
i
know
you
think
of
it
too
though
you
show
me
such
a
cheerful
countenance
and
make
such
great
plans
for
the
future
will
god
remember
my
words
or
will
he
forget
it
seems
as
if
my
reason
hung
upon
this
question
a
note
this
time
in
answer
to
one
from
john
zabel
dear
john
thank
you
for
words
which
could
have
come
from
nobody
else
my
child
is
dead
could
i
expect
anything
different
if
i
did
god
has
rebuked
me
philemon
thinks
only
of
me
we
understand
each
other
so
perfectly
now
that
our
greatest
suffering
comes
in
seeing
each
other
pain
my
load
i
can
bear
but
his
come
and
see
me
john
and
tell
james
our
house
is
open
to
him
we
have
all
done
wrong
and
are
caught
in
one
net
of
misfortune
let
it
make
us
friends
again
below
this
in
philemon
hand
my
wife
is
superstitious
strong
and
capable
as
she
is
she
has
regarded
this
sudden
taking
off
of
our
as
a
sign
that
certain
words
uttered
by
her
on
her
marriage
day
unhappily
known
to
you
and
as
i
take
it
to
james
also
have
been
remembered
by
the
righteous
god
above
us
this
is
a
weakness
which
i
can
not
combat
can
you
who
alone
of
all
the
world
beside
know
both
it
and
its
cause
help
me
by
a
renewed
friendship
whose
cheerful
and
natural
character
may
gradually
make
her
forget
if
so
come
like
old
neighbours
and
dine
with
us
on
our
wedding
day
if
god
sees
that
we
have
buried
the
past
and
are
ready
to
forgive
each
other
the
faults
of
our
youth
perhaps
he
will
further
spare
this
good
woman
i
think
she
will
be
able
to
bear
it
she
has
great
strength
except
where
a
little
child
is
concerned
that
alone
can
henceforth
stir
the
deepest
recesses
of
her
heart
after
this
a
gap
of
years
one
two
three
four
five
children
were
laid
away
to
rest
in
portchester
churchyard
then
philemon
and
she
came
to
sutherlandtown
but
not
till
after
a
certain
event
had
occurred
best
made
known
by
this
last
letter
to
philemon
dearest
husband
our
babe
is
born
our
sixth
and
our
dearest
and
the
reproach
of
its
first
look
had
to
be
met
by
me
alone
oh
why
did
i
leave
you
and
come
to
this
great
boston
where
i
have
no
friend
but
sutherland
did
i
think
i
could
break
the
spell
of
fate
or
providence
by
giving
birth
to
my
last
darling
among
strangers
i
shall
have
to
do
something
more
than
that
if
i
would
save
this
child
to
our
old
age
it
is
borne
in
upon
me
like
fate
that
never
will
a
child
prosper
at
my
breast
or
survive
the
clasp
of
my
arms
if
it
is
to
live
it
must
be
reared
by
others
some
woman
who
has
not
brought
down
the
curse
of
heaven
upon
her
by
her
own
blasphemies
must
nourish
the
tender
frame
and
receive
the
blessing
of
its
growing
love
neither
i
nor
you
can
hope
to
see
recognition
in
our
babe
eye
before
it
can
turn
upon
us
with
love
it
will
close
in
its
last
sleep
and
we
will
be
left
desolate
what
shall
we
do
then
with
this
little
son
to
whose
guardianship
can
we
entrust
it
do
you
know
a
man
good
enough
or
a
woman
sufficiently
tender
i
do
not
but
if
god
wills
that
our
little
frederick
should
live
he
will
raise
up
someone
by
the
pang
of
possible
separation
already
tearing
my
heart
i
believe
that
he
will
raise
up
someone
meanwhile
i
do
not
dare
to
kiss
the
child
lest
i
should
blight
it
he
is
so
sturdy
philemon
so
different
from
all
the
other
five
i
open
this
to
add
that
sutherland
has
just
been
in
with
her
infant
his
father
is
away
too
and
has
not
yet
seen
his
boy
and
this
is
their
first
after
ten
years
of
marriage
oh
that
my
future
opened
before
me
as
brightly
as
hers
the
next
letter
opens
with
a
cry
philemon
come
to
me
philemon
i
have
done
what
i
threatened
i
have
made
the
sacrifice
our
child
is
no
longer
ours
and
now
perhaps
he
may
live
but
oh
my
breaking
heart
my
empty
arms
help
me
to
bear
my
desolation
for
it
is
for
life
we
will
never
have
another
child
and
where
is
it
ah
that
is
the
wonder
of
it
near
you
philemon
yet
not
too
near
sutherland
has
it
and
you
may
have
seen
its
little
face
through
the
car
window
if
you
were
in
the
station
last
night
when
the
express
passed
through
to
sutherlandtown
ah
but
she
has
her
burden
to
bear
too
an
awful
secret
burden
like
my
own
only
she
will
have
the
child
for
philemon
she
has
taken
it
in
lieu
of
her
own
which
died
last
night
in
my
sight
and
sutherland
does
not
know
what
she
has
done
and
never
will
if
you
keep
the
secret
as
i
shall
for
the
sake
of
the
life
our
little
innocent
has
thus
won
what
do
i
mean
and
how
was
it
all
philemon
it
was
god
work
all
but
the
deception
and
that
is
for
the
good
of
all
and
to
save
four
broken
hearts
listen
yesterday
only
yesterday
it
seems
a
month
ago
sutherland
came
again
to
see
me
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
sutherland
is
expected
home
as
you
know
this
week
and
she
was
about
to
start
out
for
sutherlandtown
so
as
to
be
in
her
own
house
when
he
came
the
baby
was
looking
well
and
she
was
the
happiest
of
women
for
the
one
wish
of
his
heart
and
hers
had
been
fulfilled
and
she
was
soon
going
to
have
the
bliss
of
showing
the
child
to
his
father
my
own
babe
was
on
the
bed
asleep
and
i
who
am
feeling
wonderfully
strong
was
sitting
up
in
a
little
chair
as
far
away
from
him
as
possible
not
out
of
hatred
or
indifference
oh
no
but
because
he
seemed
to
rest
better
when
left
entirely
by
himself
and
not
under
the
hungry
look
of
my
eye
sutherland
went
over
to
look
at
it
oh
he
is
fair
like
my
baby
she
said
and
almost
as
sturdy
though
mine
is
a
month
older
and
she
stooped
down
and
kissed
him
philemon
he
smiled
for
her
though
he
never
had
for
me
i
saw
it
with
a
greedy
longing
that
almost
made
me
cry
out
then
i
turned
to
her
and
we
talked
of
what
i
can
not
remember
now
at
home
we
had
never
been
intimate
friends
she
is
from
sutherlandtown
and
i
am
from
portchester
and
the
distance
of
nine
miles
is
enough
to
estrange
people
but
here
each
with
a
husband
absent
and
a
darling
infant
lying
asleep
under
our
eyes
interests
we
have
never
thought
identical
drew
us
to
one
another
and
we
chatted
with
pleasure
when
suddenly
sutherland
jumped
up
in
a
terrible
fright
the
infant
she
had
been
rocking
on
her
breast
was
blue
the
next
minute
it
shuddered
the
next
it
lay
in
her
arms
dead
i
hear
the
shriek
yet
with
which
she
fell
with
it
still
in
her
arms
to
the
floor
fortunately
no
other
ears
were
open
to
her
cry
i
alone
saw
her
misery
i
alone
heard
her
tale
the
child
had
been
poisoned
philemon
poisoned
by
her
she
had
mistaken
a
cup
of
medicine
for
a
cup
of
water
and
had
given
the
child
a
few
drops
in
a
spoon
just
before
setting
out
from
her
hotel
she
had
not
known
at
the
time
what
she
had
done
but
now
she
remembered
that
the
fatal
cup
was
just
like
the
other
and
that
the
two
stood
very
near
together
oh
her
innocent
child
and
oh
her
husband
it
seemed
as
if
the
latter
thought
would
drive
her
wild
he
has
so
wished
for
a
child
she
moaned
we
have
been
married
ten
years
and
this
baby
seemed
to
have
been
sent
from
heaven
he
will
curse
me
he
will
hate
me
he
will
never
be
able
after
this
to
bear
me
in
his
sight
this
was
not
true
of
sutherland
but
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
her
instead
of
attempting
it
i
took
another
way
to
stop
her
ravings
lifting
the
child
out
of
her
hands
i
first
listened
at
its
heart
and
then
finding
it
was
really
dead
philemon
i
have
seen
too
many
lifeless
children
not
to
know
i
began
slowly
to
undress
it
what
are
you
doing
she
cried
webb
webb
what
are
you
doing
for
reply
i
pointed
to
the
bed
where
two
little
arms
could
be
seen
feebly
fluttering
you
shall
have
my
child
i
whispered
i
have
carried
too
many
babies
to
the
tomb
to
dare
risk
bringing
up
another
and
catching
her
poor
wandering
spirit
with
my
eye
i
held
her
while
i
told
her
my
story
philemon
i
saved
that
woman
before
i
had
finished
speaking
i
saw
the
reason
return
to
her
eye
and
the
dawning
of
a
pitiful
hope
in
her
face
she
looked
at
the
child
in
my
arms
and
then
she
looked
at
the
one
in
the
bed
and
the
sigh
with
which
she
finally
bent
down
and
wept
over
our
darling
told
me
that
my
cause
was
won
the
rest
was
easy
when
the
clothes
of
the
two
children
had
been
exchanged
she
took
our
baby
in
her
arms
and
prepared
to
leave
then
i
stopped
her
swear
i
cried
holding
her
by
the
arm
and
lifting
my
other
hand
to
heaven
swear
you
will
be
a
mother
to
this
child
swear
you
will
love
it
as
your
own
and
rear
it
in
the
paths
of
truth
and
righteousness
the
convulsive
clasp
with
which
she
drew
the
baby
to
her
breast
assured
me
more
than
her
shuddering
i
swear
that
her
heart
had
already
opened
to
it
i
dropped
her
arm
and
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
i
could
not
see
my
darling
go
it
was
worse
than
death
for
the
moment
it
was
worse
than
death
o
god
save
him
i
groaned
god
make
him
an
honour
but
here
she
caught
me
by
the
arm
her
clutch
was
frenzied
her
teeth
were
chattering
swear
in
your
turn
she
gasped
swear
that
if
i
do
a
mother
duty
by
this
boy
you
will
keep
my
secret
and
never
never
reveal
to
my
husband
to
the
boy
or
to
the
world
that
you
have
any
claims
upon
him
it
was
like
tearing
the
heart
from
my
breast
with
my
own
hand
but
i
swore
philemon
and
she
in
her
turn
drew
back
but
suddenly
she
faced
me
again
terror
and
doubt
in
all
her
looks
your
husband
she
whispered
can
you
keep
such
a
secret
from
him
you
will
breathe
it
in
your
dreams
i
shall
tell
him
i
answered
tell
him
the
hair
seemed
to
rise
on
her
forehead
and
she
shook
so
that
i
feared
she
would
drop
the
babe
be
careful
i
cried
see
you
frighten
the
babe
my
husband
has
but
one
heart
with
me
what
i
do
he
will
subscribe
to
do
not
fear
philemon
so
i
promised
in
your
name
gradually
she
grew
calmer
when
i
saw
she
was
steady
again
i
motioned
her
to
go
even
my
more
than
mortal
strength
was
failing
and
the
baby
philemon
i
had
never
kissed
it
and
i
did
not
kiss
it
then
i
heard
her
feet
draw
slowly
towards
the
door
i
heard
her
hand
fall
on
the
knob
heard
it
turn
uttered
one
cry
and
then
they
found
me
an
hour
after
lying
along
the
floor
clasping
the
dead
infant
in
my
arms
i
was
in
a
swoon
and
they
all
think
i
fell
with
the
child
as
perhaps
i
did
and
that
its
little
life
went
out
during
my
insensibility
of
its
features
like
and
yet
unlike
our
boy
no
one
seems
to
take
heed
the
nurse
who
cared
for
it
is
gone
and
who
else
would
know
that
little
face
but
me
they
are
very
good
to
me
and
are
full
of
for
leaving
me
so
long
in
my
part
of
the
building
alone
but
though
they
watch
me
now
i
have
contrived
to
write
this
letter
which
you
will
get
with
the
one
telling
of
the
baby
death
and
my
own
dangerous
condition
destroy
it
philemon
and
then
come
nothing
in
all
the
world
will
give
me
comfort
but
your
hand
laid
under
my
head
and
your
true
eyes
looking
into
mine
ah
we
must
love
each
other
now
and
live
humbly
all
our
woe
has
come
from
my
early
girlish
delight
in
gay
and
elegant
things
from
this
day
on
i
eschew
all
vanities
and
find
in
your
affection
alone
the
solace
which
heaven
will
not
deny
to
our
bewildered
hearts
perhaps
in
this
way
the
blessing
that
has
been
denied
us
will
be
visited
on
our
child
who
will
live
i
am
now
sure
to
be
the
delight
of
our
hearts
and
the
pride
of
our
eyes
even
though
we
are
denied
the
bliss
of
his
presence
and
affection
sutherland
was
not
seen
to
enter
or
go
out
of
my
rooms
being
on
her
way
to
the
depot
she
kept
on
her
way
and
must
be
now
in
her
own
home
her
secret
is
safe
but
ours
oh
you
will
help
me
to
preserve
it
help
me
not
to
betray
tell
them
i
have
lost
five
babies
before
this
one
delirious
there
may
be
an
inquest
she
must
not
be
mentioned
let
all
the
blame
fall
on
me
if
there
is
blame
i
fell
there
is
a
bruise
on
the
baby
forehead
and
and
i
am
growing
incoherent
i
will
try
and
direct
this
and
then
love
love
o
god
a
scrawl
for
the
name
under
it
these
words
though
bidden
to
destroy
this
i
have
never
dared
to
do
so
some
day
it
may
be
of
inestimable
value
to
us
or
our
boy
philemon
webb
this
was
the
last
letter
found
in
the
first
packet
as
it
was
laid
down
sobs
were
heard
all
over
the
room
and
frederick
who
for
some
time
now
had
been
sitting
with
his
head
in
his
hands
ventured
to
look
up
and
say
do
you
wonder
that
i
endeavoured
to
keep
this
secret
bought
at
such
a
price
and
sealed
by
the
death
of
her
i
thought
my
mother
and
of
her
who
really
was
gentlemen
sutherland
loved
his
wife
and
honoured
her
memory
to
tell
him
as
i
shall
have
to
within
the
hour
that
the
child
she
placed
in
his
arms
years
ago
was
an
alien
and
that
all
his
love
his
care
his
disappointment
and
his
sufferings
had
been
lavished
on
the
son
of
a
neighbour
required
greater
courage
than
to
face
doubt
on
the
faces
of
my
or
anything
in
short
but
absolute
arraignment
on
the
charge
of
murder
hence
my
silence
hence
my
indecision
till
this
woman
here
he
pointed
a
scornful
finger
at
amabel
now
shrinking
in
her
chair
drove
me
to
it
by
secretly
threatening
me
with
a
testimony
which
would
have
made
me
the
murderer
of
my
mother
and
the
lasting
disgrace
of
a
good
man
who
alone
has
been
without
blame
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
this
desperate
affair
she
was
about
to
speak
when
i
forestalled
her
my
punishment
if
i
deserve
such
will
be
to
sit
and
hear
in
your
presence
the
reading
of
the
letters
still
remaining
in
the
coroner
hands
these
letters
were
certain
ones
written
by
agatha
to
her
unacknowledged
son
they
had
never
been
sent
the
first
one
dated
from
his
earliest
infancy
and
its
simple
and
touching
hopefulness
sent
a
thrill
through
every
heart
it
read
as
follows
three
years
old
my
darling
and
the
health
flush
has
not
faded
from
your
cheek
nor
the
bright
gold
from
your
hair
oh
how
i
bless
sutherland
that
she
did
not
rebuke
me
when
your
father
and
i
came
to
sutherlandtown
and
set
up
our
home
where
i
could
at
least
see
your
merry
form
toddling
through
the
streets
holding
on
to
the
hand
of
her
who
now
claims
your
love
my
darling
my
pride
my
angel
so
near
and
yet
so
far
removed
will
you
ever
know
even
in
the
heaven
to
which
we
all
look
for
joy
after
our
weary
pilgrimage
is
over
how
often
in
this
troublous
world
and
in
these
days
of
your
early
infancy
i
have
crept
out
of
my
warm
bed
dressed
myself
and
without
a
word
to
your
father
whose
heart
it
would
break
gone
out
and
climbed
the
steep
hillside
just
to
look
at
the
window
of
your
room
to
see
if
it
were
light
or
dark
and
you
awake
or
sleeping
to
breathe
the
scent
of
the
eglantine
which
climbs
up
to
your
nursery
window
i
have
braved
the
and
the
watching
eyes
of
heaven
but
you
have
a
blissful
ignorance
of
all
this
you
only
grow
and
grow
and
live
my
darling
live
which
is
the
only
boon
i
crave
the
only
recompense
i
ask
have
i
but
added
another
sin
to
my
account
and
brought
a
worse
vengeance
on
myself
than
that
of
seeing
you
die
in
your
early
infancy
frederick
my
son
my
son
i
heard
you
swear
not
lightly
thoughtlessly
as
boys
sometimes
will
in
imitation
of
their
elders
but
bitterly
revengefully
as
if
the
seeds
of
evil
passions
were
already
pushing
to
life
in
the
boyish
breast
i
thought
so
innocent
did
you
wonder
at
the
strange
woman
who
stopped
you
did
you
realise
the
awful
woe
from
which
my
commonplace
words
sprang
no
no
what
grown
mind
could
take
that
in
least
of
all
a
child
to
have
forsworn
the
bliss
of
motherhood
and
entered
upon
a
life
of
deception
for
this
truly
heaven
is
implacable
and
my
last
sin
is
to
be
punished
more
inexorably
than
my
first
there
are
worse
evils
than
death
this
i
have
always
heard
but
now
i
know
it
god
was
merciful
when
he
slew
my
babes
and
i
presumptous
in
my
rebellion
and
the
efforts
with
which
i
tried
to
prevent
his
work
frederick
you
are
weak
dissipated
and
without
conscience
the
darling
babe
the
beautiful
child
has
grown
into
a
reckless
youth
whose
impulses
sutherland
will
find
it
hard
to
restrain
and
over
whom
his
mother
do
call
her
your
mother
has
little
influence
though
she
tries
hard
to
do
a
mother
part
and
save
herself
and
myself
from
boundless
regret
my
boy
my
boy
do
you
feel
the
lack
of
your
own
mother
vigour
might
you
have
lived
under
my
care
and
owned
a
better
restraint
and
learned
to
work
and
live
a
respectable
life
in
circumstances
less
provocative
of
such
questions
when
they
rise
are
maddening
when
i
see
them
form
themselves
in
eyes
i
drive
them
out
with
all
the
force
of
my
influence
which
is
still
strong
over
him
but
when
they
make
way
in
my
own
breast
i
can
find
no
relief
not
even
in
prayer
frederick
were
i
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
your
parentage
would
the
shock
of
such
an
unexpected
revelation
make
a
man
of
you
i
have
been
tempted
to
make
the
trial
at
times
deep
down
in
my
heart
i
have
thought
that
perhaps
i
should
best
serve
the
good
man
who
is
growing
grey
under
your
waywardness
by
opening
up
before
you
the
past
and
present
agonies
of
which
you
are
the
unconscious
centre
but
i
can
not
do
this
while
she
lives
the
look
she
gave
me
one
day
when
i
approached
you
a
step
too
near
at
the
church
door
proves
that
it
would
be
the
killing
of
her
to
reveal
her
secret
now
i
must
wait
her
death
which
seems
near
and
then
no
i
can
not
do
it
sutherland
has
but
one
staff
to
lean
on
and
that
is
you
it
may
be
a
poor
one
a
breaking
one
but
it
is
still
a
staff
i
dare
not
take
it
away
i
dare
not
ah
if
philemon
was
the
man
he
was
once
he
might
counsel
me
but
he
is
only
a
child
now
just
as
if
god
had
heard
my
cry
for
children
and
had
given
me
him
more
money
and
still
more
money
and
i
hate
it
except
for
what
it
will
do
for
the
poor
and
incapable
about
me
how
strange
are
the
ways
of
providence
to
us
who
have
no
need
of
aught
beyond
a
competence
money
pours
in
almost
against
our
will
while
to
those
who
long
and
labour
for
it
it
comes
not
or
comes
so
slowly
the
life
wears
out
in
the
waiting
and
the
working
the
zabels
now
once
with
a
good
business
and
a
home
full
of
curious
works
of
art
they
now
appear
to
find
it
hard
to
obtain
even
the
necessities
of
life
such
are
the
freaks
of
fortune
or
should
i
say
the
dealings
of
an
inscrutable
providence
once
i
tried
to
give
something
out
of
my
abundance
to
these
old
friends
but
their
pride
stood
in
the
way
and
the
attempt
failed
worse
than
that
as
if
to
show
that
benefits
should
proceed
from
them
to
me
rather
than
from
me
to
them
james
bestowed
on
me
a
gift
it
is
a
strange
one
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
quaint
florentine
dagger
which
i
had
often
admired
for
its
exquisite
workmanship
was
it
the
last
treasure
he
possessed
i
am
almost
afraid
so
at
all
events
it
shall
lie
here
in
my
where
i
alone
can
see
it
such
sights
are
not
good
for
philemon
he
must
have
cheerful
objects
before
him
happy
faces
such
as
mine
tries
to
be
but
ah
i
would
gladly
give
my
life
if
i
could
once
hold
you
in
my
arms
my
erring
but
beloved
son
will
the
day
ever
come
when
i
can
will
you
have
strength
enough
to
hear
my
story
and
preserve
your
peace
and
let
me
go
down
to
the
grave
with
the
memory
of
one
look
one
smile
that
is
for
me
alone
sometimes
i
foresee
this
hour
and
am
happy
for
a
few
short
minutes
and
then
some
fresh
story
of
your
recklessness
is
wafted
through
the
town
and
what
stopped
her
at
this
point
we
shall
never
know
some
want
of
philemon
perhaps
at
all
events
she
left
off
here
and
the
letter
was
never
resumed
it
was
the
last
secret
outpouring
of
her
heart
with
this
broken
sentence
agatha
letters
that
afternoon
before
the
inquiry
broke
up
the
jury
brought
in
their
verdict
it
was
death
by
means
of
a
wound
inflicted
upon
herself
in
a
moment
of
terror
and
misapprehension
it
was
all
his
could
do
for
frederick
xxxiii
father
and
son
but
frederick
day
of
trial
was
not
yet
over
there
was
a
closed
door
to
open
and
a
father
to
see
as
in
his
heart
he
still
called
sutherland
then
there
were
friends
to
face
and
foes
under
conditions
he
better
than
anyone
else
knew
were
in
some
regards
made
worse
rather
than
better
by
the
admissions
and
revelations
of
this
eventful
day
agnes
for
instance
how
could
he
meet
her
pure
gaze
but
it
was
his
father
he
must
first
confront
his
father
to
whom
he
would
have
to
repeat
in
private
the
tale
which
robbed
the
best
of
men
of
a
past
and
took
from
him
a
son
almost
a
wife
without
leaving
him
one
memory
calculated
to
console
him
frederick
was
so
absorbed
in
this
anticipation
that
he
scarcely
noticed
the
two
or
three
timid
hands
stretched
out
in
encouragement
toward
him
and
was
moving
slowly
toward
the
door
behind
which
his
father
had
disappeared
so
many
hours
before
when
he
was
recalled
to
the
interests
of
the
moment
by
a
single
word
uttered
not
very
far
from
him
it
was
simply
well
but
it
was
uttered
by
knapp
and
repeated
by
courtney
frederick
shuddered
and
was
hurrying
on
when
he
found
himself
stopped
by
a
piteous
figure
that
with
appealing
eyes
and
timid
gestures
stepped
up
before
him
it
was
amabel
forgive
she
murmured
looking
like
a
pleading
saint
i
did
not
know
i
never
dreamed
you
were
so
much
of
a
man
frederick
that
you
bore
such
a
heart
cherished
such
griefs
were
so
worthy
of
love
and
a
woman
admiration
if
i
had
her
expression
was
eloquent
more
eloquent
than
he
had
ever
seen
it
for
it
had
real
feeling
in
it
but
he
put
her
coldly
by
when
my
father
white
hairs
become
black
again
and
the
story
of
my
shame
is
forgotten
in
this
world
then
come
back
and
i
will
forgive
you
and
he
was
passing
on
when
another
touch
detained
him
he
turned
this
time
in
some
impatience
only
to
meet
the
frank
eyes
of
sweetwater
as
he
knew
very
little
of
this
young
man
save
that
he
was
the
amateur
detective
who
had
by
some
folly
of
his
own
been
carried
off
on
the
hesper
and
who
was
probably
the
only
man
saved
from
its
wreck
he
was
about
to
greet
him
with
some
commonplace
phrase
of
congratulation
when
sweetwater
interrupted
him
with
the
following
words
i
only
wanted
to
say
that
it
may
be
easier
for
you
to
approach
your
father
with
the
revelations
you
are
about
to
make
if
you
knew
that
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
he
is
much
more
likely
to
be
relieved
by
such
proofs
of
innocence
as
you
can
give
him
than
overwhelmed
by
such
as
show
the
lack
of
kinship
between
you
for
two
weeks
sutherland
has
been
bending
under
the
belief
of
your
personal
criminality
in
this
matter
this
was
his
secret
which
was
shared
by
me
by
you
yes
by
me
i
am
more
closely
linked
to
this
affair
than
you
can
readily
imagine
some
day
i
may
be
able
to
explain
myself
but
not
now
only
remember
what
i
have
said
about
your
father
pardon
me
i
should
perhaps
say
sutherland
and
act
accordingly
perhaps
it
was
to
tell
you
this
that
i
was
forced
back
here
against
my
will
by
the
strangest
series
of
events
that
ever
happened
to
a
man
but
he
added
with
a
sidelong
look
at
the
group
of
men
still
hovering
about
the
table
i
had
rather
think
it
was
for
some
more
important
office
still
but
this
the
future
will
show
the
future
which
i
seem
to
see
lowering
in
the
faces
over
there
and
waiting
for
no
reply
he
melted
into
the
crowd
frederick
passed
at
once
to
his
father
no
one
interrupted
them
during
this
solemn
interview
but
the
large
crowd
that
in
the
halls
and
on
the
steps
of
the
building
awaited
frederick
reappearance
showed
that
the
public
interest
was
still
warm
in
a
matter
affecting
so
deeply
the
heart
and
interests
of
their
best
citizen
when
therefore
that
door
finally
opened
and
frederick
was
seen
escorting
sutherland
on
his
arm
the
tide
of
feeling
which
had
not
yet
subsided
since
agatha
letters
were
read
vented
itself
in
one
great
sob
of
relief
for
sutherland
face
was
calmer
than
when
they
had
last
seen
it
and
his
step
more
assured
and
he
leaned
or
made
himself
lean
on
frederick
arm
as
if
to
impress
upon
all
who
saw
them
that
the
ties
of
years
can
not
be
shaken
off
so
easily
and
that
he
still
looked
upon
frederick
as
his
son
but
he
was
not
contented
with
this
dumb
show
eloquent
as
it
was
as
the
crowd
parted
and
these
two
imposing
figures
took
their
way
down
the
steps
to
the
carriage
which
had
been
sent
for
them
sutherland
cast
one
deep
and
long
glance
about
him
on
faces
he
knew
and
on
faces
he
did
not
know
on
those
who
were
near
and
those
who
were
far
and
raising
his
voice
which
did
not
tremble
as
much
as
might
have
been
expected
said
deliberately
my
son
accompanies
me
to
his
home
if
he
should
afterwards
be
wanted
he
will
be
found
at
his
own
fireside
my
friends
i
thank
you
for
the
goodwill
you
have
this
day
shown
us
both
then
he
entered
the
carriage
the
solemn
way
in
which
frederick
bared
his
head
in
acknowledgment
of
this
public
recognition
of
the
hold
he
still
retained
on
this
one
faithful
heart
struck
awe
into
the
hearts
of
all
who
saw
it
so
that
the
carriage
rolled
off
in
silence
closing
one
of
the
most
thrilling
and
impressive
scenes
ever
witnessed
in
that
village
xxxiv
not
when
they
are
young
girls
but
alas
all
tides
have
their
ebb
as
well
as
flow
and
before
sutherland
and
frederick
were
well
out
of
the
main
street
the
latter
became
aware
that
notwithstanding
the
respect
with
which
his
explanations
had
been
received
by
the
jury
there
were
many
of
his
who
were
ready
to
show
dissatisfaction
at
his
being
allowed
to
return
in
freedom
to
that
home
where
he
had
still
every
prospect
of
being
called
the
young
master
doubt
that
seed
of
ramifying
growth
had
been
planted
in
more
than
one
breast
and
while
it
failed
as
yet
to
break
out
into
any
open
manifestation
there
were
evidences
enough
in
the
very
restraint
visible
in
such
groups
of
people
as
they
passed
that
suspicion
had
not
been
suppressed
or
his
innocence
established
by
the
verdict
of
the
coroner
jury
to
sutherland
suffering
now
from
the
reaction
following
all
great
efforts
much
if
not
all
of
this
quiet
but
significant
display
of
public
feeling
passed
unnoticed
but
to
frederick
alive
to
the
least
look
the
least
sign
that
his
story
had
not
been
accepted
unquestioned
this
passage
through
the
town
was
the
occasion
of
the
most
poignant
suffering
for
not
only
did
these
marks
of
public
suspicion
bespeak
possible
arraignment
in
the
future
but
through
them
it
became
evident
that
even
if
he
escaped
open
condemnation
in
the
courts
he
could
never
hope
for
complete
reinstatement
before
the
world
nor
what
was
to
him
a
still
deeper
source
of
despair
anticipate
a
day
when
agnes
love
should
make
amends
to
him
for
the
grief
and
errors
of
his
more
than
wayward
youth
he
could
never
marry
so
pure
a
being
while
the
shadow
of
crime
separated
him
from
the
mass
of
human
beings
her
belief
in
his
innocence
and
the
exact
truth
of
his
story
and
he
was
confident
she
did
believe
him
could
make
no
difference
in
this
conclusion
while
he
was
regarded
openly
or
in
dark
corners
or
beside
the
humblest
fireside
as
a
possible
criminal
neither
sutherland
nor
her
father
nor
his
own
heart
even
would
allow
him
to
offer
her
anything
but
a
friend
gratitude
or
win
from
her
anything
but
a
neighbour
sympathy
yet
in
bidding
to
larger
hopes
and
more
importunate
desires
he
parted
with
the
better
part
of
his
heart
and
the
only
solace
remaining
in
this
world
for
the
boundless
griefs
and
tragic
experiences
of
his
still
young
life
he
had
learned
to
love
through
suffering
only
to
realise
that
the
very
nature
of
his
suffering
forbade
him
to
indulge
in
love
and
this
seemed
a
final
judgment
even
in
this
hour
of
public
justification
he
had
told
his
story
and
been
for
the
moment
believed
but
what
was
there
in
his
life
what
was
there
in
the
facts
as
witnessed
by
others
what
was
there
in
his
mother
letters
and
the
revelation
of
their
secret
relationship
to
corroborate
his
assertions
or
to
prove
that
her
hand
and
not
his
had
held
the
weapon
when
the
gushed
from
her
devoted
breast
nothing
nothing
only
his
word
to
stand
against
all
human
probabilities
and
natural
inference
only
his
word
and
the
generous
nature
of
the
woman
who
had
thus
perished
though
a
dozen
of
his
had
by
their
verdict
professed
their
belief
in
his
word
and
given
him
the
benefit
of
a
doubt
involving
his
life
as
well
as
his
honour
he
as
well
as
they
knew
that
neither
the
police
nor
the
general
public
were
given
to
sentimentality
and
that
the
question
of
his
guilt
still
lay
open
and
must
remain
so
till
his
dying
day
for
from
the
nature
of
things
no
proof
of
the
truth
was
probable
batsy
being
dead
only
god
and
his
own
heart
could
know
that
the
facts
of
that
awful
were
as
he
had
told
them
had
god
in
his
justice
removed
in
this
striking
way
his
only
witness
as
a
punishment
for
his
sins
and
his
mad
indulgence
in
acts
so
little
short
of
crime
as
to
partake
of
its
guilt
and
merit
its
obloquy
he
was
asking
himself
this
question
as
he
bent
to
fasten
the
gate
his
father
had
passed
in
the
carriage
had
driven
off
and
the
road
was
almost
solitary
but
not
quite
as
he
leaned
his
arm
over
the
gate
and
turned
to
take
a
final
glance
down
the
hillside
he
saw
with
what
feelings
no
one
will
ever
know
the
light
figure
of
agnes
advancing
on
the
arm
of
her
father
he
would
have
drawn
back
but
a
better
impulse
intervened
and
he
stood
his
ground
halliday
who
walked
very
close
to
agnes
cast
her
an
admonitory
glance
which
frederick
was
not
slow
in
interpreting
then
stopped
reluctantly
perhaps
because
he
saw
her
falter
perhaps
because
he
knew
that
an
interview
between
these
two
was
unavoidable
and
had
best
be
quickly
over
frederick
found
his
voice
first
agnes
said
he
i
am
glad
of
this
opportunity
for
expressing
my
gratitude
you
have
acted
like
a
friend
and
have
earned
my
eternal
consideration
even
if
we
never
speak
again
there
was
a
momentary
silence
her
head
which
had
drooped
under
his
greeting
rose
again
her
eyes
humid
with
feeling
sought
his
face
why
do
you
speak
like
that
said
she
why
should
we
meet
does
not
everyone
recognise
your
innocence
and
will
not
the
whole
world
soon
see
as
i
have
that
you
have
left
the
old
life
behind
and
have
only
to
be
your
new
self
to
win
everyone
regard
agnes
returned
frederick
smiling
sadly
as
he
observed
the
sudden
alarm
visible
in
her
father
face
at
these
enthusiastic
words
you
know
me
perhaps
better
than
others
do
and
are
prepared
to
believe
my
words
and
my
more
than
unhappy
story
but
there
are
few
like
you
in
the
world
people
in
general
will
not
acquit
me
and
if
there
was
only
one
person
who
doubted
halliday
began
to
look
relieved
i
would
fail
to
give
any
promise
of
the
new
life
you
hope
to
see
me
lead
if
i
allowed
the
shadow
under
which
i
undoubtedly
rest
to
fall
in
the
remotest
way
across
yours
you
and
i
have
been
friends
and
will
continue
such
but
we
will
hold
little
intercourse
in
future
hard
as
i
find
it
to
say
so
does
not
halliday
consider
this
right
as
your
father
he
must
agnes
eyes
leaving
frederick
for
a
moment
sought
her
father
alas
there
was
no
mistaking
their
language
sighing
deeply
she
again
hung
her
head
too
much
care
for
people
opinion
she
murmured
and
too
little
for
what
is
best
and
noblest
in
us
i
do
not
recognise
the
necessity
of
a
farewell
between
us
any
more
than
i
recognise
that
anyone
who
saw
and
heard
you
can
believe
in
your
guilt
but
there
are
so
many
who
did
not
hear
and
see
me
besides
here
he
turned
a
little
and
pointed
to
the
garden
in
his
rear
for
the
past
week
a
man
i
need
not
state
who
nor
under
what
authority
he
acts
has
been
in
hiding
under
that
arbour
watching
my
every
movement
and
almost
counting
my
sighs
yesterday
he
left
for
a
short
space
but
he
is
back
what
does
that
argue
dear
friend
innocence
completely
recognised
does
not
call
for
such
guardianship
the
slight
frame
of
the
young
girl
bending
so
innocently
toward
him
shuddered
involuntarily
at
this
and
her
eyes
frightened
and
flashing
swept
over
the
arbour
before
returning
to
his
face
if
there
is
a
watcher
there
and
if
such
a
fact
proves
you
to
be
in
danger
of
arrest
for
a
crime
you
never
committed
then
it
behooves
your
friends
to
show
where
they
stand
in
this
matter
and
by
lending
their
sympathy
give
you
courage
and
power
to
meet
the
trials
before
you
not
when
they
are
young
girls
murmured
frederick
and
casting
a
glance
at
halliday
he
stepped
softly
back
agnes
flushed
and
yielded
to
her
father
gentle
pressure
my
friend
she
said
the
quiver
in
her
tones
sinking
deep
into
heart
some
day
it
will
be
and
her
head
turned
back
over
her
shoulder
took
on
a
beautiful
radiance
that
fixed
itself
forever
in
the
hungry
heart
of
him
who
watched
it
disappear
when
she
was
quite
gone
a
man
not
the
one
whom
frederick
had
described
as
lying
in
hiding
in
the
arbour
but
a
different
one
in
fact
no
other
than
our
old
friend
the
constable
advanced
around
the
corner
of
the
house
and
presented
a
paper
to
him
it
was
the
warrant
for
his
arrest
on
a
charge
of
murder
xxxv
sweetwater
pays
his
debt
at
last
to
sutherland
frederick
arrest
had
been
conducted
so
quietly
that
no
hint
of
the
matter
reached
the
village
before
the
next
morning
then
the
whole
town
broke
into
uproar
and
business
was
not
only
suspended
but
the
streets
and
docks
overflowed
with
gesticulating
men
and
excited
women
carrying
on
in
every
corner
and
across
innumerable
doorsteps
the
endless
debate
which
such
an
action
on
the
part
of
the
police
necessarily
opened
but
the
most
agitated
face
though
the
stillest
tongue
was
not
to
be
seen
in
town
that
morning
but
in
a
little
cottage
on
an
arid
overlooking
the
sea
here
sweetwater
sat
and
communed
with
his
great
monitor
the
ocean
and
only
from
his
flashing
eye
and
the
firm
set
of
his
lips
could
the
mother
of
sweetwater
see
that
the
crisis
of
her
life
was
rapidly
approaching
and
that
on
the
outcome
of
this
long
brooding
rested
not
only
his
own
but
the
interests
of
the
man
most
dear
to
them
suddenly
from
that
far
horizon
upon
which
sweetwater
eye
rested
with
a
look
that
was
almost
a
demand
came
an
answer
that
flushed
him
with
a
hope
as
great
as
it
was
unexpected
bounding
to
his
feet
he
confronted
his
mother
with
eager
eyes
and
outstretched
hand
give
me
money
all
the
money
we
have
in
the
house
i
have
an
idea
that
may
be
worth
all
i
can
ever
make
or
can
ever
hope
to
have
if
it
succeeds
we
save
frederick
sutherland
if
it
fails
i
have
only
to
meet
another
of
knapp
scornful
looks
but
it
wo
fail
the
inspiration
came
from
the
sea
and
the
sea
you
know
is
my
second
mother
what
this
inspiration
was
he
did
not
say
but
it
carried
him
presently
into
town
and
landed
him
in
the
telegraph
office
the
scene
later
in
the
day
when
frederick
entered
the
village
under
the
guardianship
of
the
police
was
indescribable
sutherland
had
insisted
upon
accompanying
him
and
when
the
figure
and
white
head
were
recognised
the
throng
which
had
rapidly
collected
in
the
thoroughfare
leading
to
the
depot
succumbed
to
the
feelings
occasioned
by
this
devotion
and
fell
into
a
wondering
silence
frederick
had
never
looked
better
there
is
something
in
the
extremity
of
fate
which
brings
out
a
man
best
characteristics
and
this
man
having
much
that
was
good
in
him
showed
it
at
that
moment
as
never
before
in
his
short
but
life
as
the
carriage
stopped
before
the
on
its
way
to
the
train
a
glimpse
was
given
of
his
handsome
head
to
those
who
had
followed
him
closest
and
as
there
became
visible
for
the
first
time
in
his
face
so
altered
under
his
troubles
a
likeness
to
their
beautiful
and
commanding
agatha
a
murmur
broke
out
around
him
that
was
half
a
wail
and
half
a
groan
and
which
affected
him
so
that
he
turned
from
his
father
whose
hand
he
was
secretly
holding
and
taking
the
whole
scene
in
with
one
flash
of
his
eye
was
about
to
speak
when
a
sudden
hubbub
broke
out
in
the
direction
of
the
telegraph
office
and
a
man
was
seen
rushing
down
the
street
holding
a
paper
high
over
his
head
it
was
sweetwater
news
he
cried
news
a
cablegram
from
the
azores
a
swedish
sailor
but
here
a
man
with
more
authority
than
the
amateur
detective
pushed
his
way
to
the
carriage
and
took
off
his
hat
to
sutherland
i
beg
your
pardon
said
he
but
the
prisoner
will
not
leave
town
important
evidence
has
just
reached
us
sutherland
saw
that
it
was
in
frederick
favour
and
fainted
on
his
son
neck
as
the
people
beheld
his
head
fall
forward
and
observed
the
look
with
which
frederick
received
him
in
his
arms
they
broke
into
a
great
shout
news
they
shrieked
news
frederick
sutherland
is
innocent
see
the
old
man
has
fainted
from
joy
and
caps
went
up
and
tears
fell
before
a
mother
son
of
them
knew
what
grounds
he
had
for
his
enthusiasm
later
they
found
they
were
good
and
substantial
ones
sweetwater
had
remembered
the
group
of
sailors
who
had
passed
by
the
corner
of
house
just
as
batsy
fell
forward
on
the
and
cabling
to
the
captain
of
the
vessel
at
the
first
port
at
which
they
were
likely
to
put
in
was
fortunate
enough
to
receive
in
reply
a
communication
from
one
of
the
men
who
remembered
the
words
she
shouted
they
were
in
swedish
and
none
of
his
mates
had
understood
them
but
he
recalled
them
well
they
