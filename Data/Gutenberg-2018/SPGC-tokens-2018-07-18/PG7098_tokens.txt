this
book
is
inscribed
in
token
of
kindred
and
of
old
family
friendships
cordially
preserved
into
the
present
generation
these
legends
unite
the
two
sides
of
the
atlantic
and
form
a
part
of
the
common
heritage
of
the
race
preface
hawthorne
in
his
has
described
the
beautiful
greek
myths
and
traditions
but
no
one
has
yet
made
similar
use
of
the
wondrous
tales
that
gathered
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
about
the
islands
of
the
atlantic
deep
although
they
are
a
part
of
the
mythical
period
of
american
history
these
hazy
legends
were
altogether
disdained
by
the
earlier
historians
indeed
george
bancroft
made
it
a
matter
of
actual
pride
that
the
beginning
of
the
american
annals
was
bare
and
literal
but
in
truth
no
national
history
has
been
less
prosaic
as
to
its
earlier
traditions
because
every
visitor
had
to
cross
the
sea
to
reach
it
and
the
sea
has
always
been
by
the
mystery
of
its
horizon
the
fury
of
its
storms
and
the
variableness
of
the
atmosphere
above
it
the
foreordained
land
of
romance
in
all
ages
and
with
all
races
there
has
always
been
something
especially
fascinating
about
an
island
amid
the
ocean
its
very
existence
has
for
all
explorers
an
air
of
magic
an
island
offers
to
us
heights
rising
from
depths
it
exhibits
that
which
is
most
fixed
beside
that
which
is
most
changeable
the
fertile
beside
the
barren
and
safety
after
danger
the
ocean
forever
tends
to
encroach
on
the
island
the
island
upon
the
ocean
they
exist
side
by
side
friends
yet
enemies
the
island
signifies
safety
in
calm
and
yet
danger
in
storm
in
a
tempest
the
sailor
rejoices
that
he
is
not
near
it
even
if
previously
bound
for
it
he
puts
about
and
steers
for
the
open
sea
often
if
he
seeks
it
he
can
not
reach
it
the
present
writer
spent
a
winter
on
the
island
of
fayal
and
saw
in
a
storm
a
ship
drift
through
the
harbor
disabled
having
lost
her
anchors
and
it
was
a
week
before
she
again
made
the
port
there
are
groups
of
islands
scattered
over
the
tropical
ocean
especially
to
which
might
well
be
given
herman
melville
name
las
encantadas
the
enchanted
islands
these
islands
usually
volcanic
have
no
vegetation
but
cactuses
or
wiry
bushes
with
strange
names
no
inhabitants
but
insects
and
reptiles
lizards
spiders
snakes
with
vast
tortoises
which
seem
of
immemorial
age
and
are
coated
with
seaweed
and
the
slime
of
the
ocean
if
there
are
any
birds
it
is
the
strange
and
heavy
penguin
the
passing
albatross
or
the
mother
cary
chicken
which
has
been
called
the
humming
bird
of
ocean
and
here
finds
a
place
for
its
young
by
night
these
birds
come
for
their
repose
at
earliest
dawn
they
take
wing
and
hover
over
the
sea
leaving
the
isle
deserted
the
only
busy
or
beautiful
life
which
always
surrounds
it
is
that
of
a
myriad
species
of
fish
of
all
forms
and
shapes
and
often
more
gorgeous
than
any
butterflies
in
gold
and
scarlet
and
yellow
once
set
foot
on
such
an
island
and
you
begin
at
once
to
understand
the
legends
of
enchantment
which
ages
have
collected
around
such
spots
climb
to
its
heights
you
seem
at
the
masthead
of
some
lonely
vessel
kept
forever
at
sea
you
feel
as
if
no
one
but
yourself
had
ever
landed
there
and
yet
perhaps
even
there
looking
straight
downward
you
see
below
you
in
some
crevice
of
the
rock
a
mast
or
spar
of
some
wrecked
vessel
encrusted
with
all
manner
of
shells
and
uncouth
vegetable
growth
no
matter
how
distant
the
island
or
how
peacefully
it
seems
to
lie
upon
the
water
there
may
be
perplexing
currents
that
ever
foam
and
swirl
about
it
currents
which
are
at
all
tides
and
in
the
calmest
weather
as
dangerous
as
any
tempest
and
which
make
compass
untrustworthy
and
helm
powerless
it
is
to
be
remembered
also
that
an
island
not
only
appears
and
disappears
upon
the
horizon
in
brighter
or
darker
skies
but
it
varies
its
height
and
shape
doubles
itself
in
mirage
or
looks
as
if
broken
asunder
divided
into
two
or
three
indeed
the
buccaneer
cowley
writing
of
one
such
island
which
he
had
visited
says
my
fancy
led
me
to
call
it
enchanted
isle
for
we
having
had
a
sight
of
it
upon
several
points
of
the
compass
it
appeared
always
in
so
many
different
forms
sometimes
like
a
ruined
fortification
upon
another
point
like
a
great
city
if
much
of
this
is
true
even
now
it
was
far
truer
before
the
days
of
columbus
when
men
were
constantly
looking
westward
across
the
atlantic
and
wondering
what
was
beyond
in
those
days
when
no
one
knew
with
certainty
whether
the
ocean
they
observed
was
a
sea
or
a
vast
lake
it
was
often
called
the
sea
of
darkness
a
friend
of
the
latin
poet
ovid
describing
the
first
approach
to
this
sea
says
that
as
you
sail
out
upon
it
the
day
itself
vanishes
and
the
world
soon
ends
in
perpetual
darkness
quo
ferimur
ruit
ipsa
dies
orbemque
relictum
ultima
perpetuis
claudit
natura
tenebris
nevertheless
it
was
the
vague
belief
of
many
nations
that
the
abodes
of
the
blest
lay
somewhere
beyond
it
in
the
other
world
a
region
half
earthly
half
heavenly
whence
the
spirits
of
the
departed
could
not
cross
the
water
to
return
and
so
they
were
constantly
imagining
excursions
made
by
favored
mortals
to
enchanted
islands
to
add
to
the
confusion
actual
islands
in
the
atlantic
were
sometimes
discovered
and
actually
lost
again
as
for
instance
the
canaries
which
were
reached
and
called
the
fortunate
isles
a
little
before
the
christian
era
and
were
then
lost
to
sight
for
thirteen
centuries
ere
being
visited
again
the
glamour
of
enchantment
was
naturally
first
attached
by
europeans
to
islands
within
sight
of
their
own
shores
irish
welsh
breton
or
spanish
and
then
as
these
islands
became
better
known
imaginations
carried
the
mystery
further
out
over
the
unknown
western
sea
the
line
of
legend
gradually
extended
itself
till
it
formed
an
imaginary
chart
for
columbus
the
aged
astronomer
toscanelli
for
instance
suggesting
to
him
the
advantage
of
making
the
supposed
island
of
antillia
a
station
just
as
it
was
proposed
long
centuries
after
to
find
a
station
for
the
ocean
telegraph
in
the
equally
imaginary
island
of
jacquet
which
has
only
lately
disappeared
from
the
charts
with
every
step
in
knowledge
the
line
of
fancied
rearranged
itself
the
fictitious
names
flitting
from
place
to
place
on
the
maps
and
sometimes
duplicating
themselves
where
the
tradition
itself
has
vanished
we
find
that
the
names
with
which
it
associated
itself
are
still
assigned
as
in
case
of
brazil
and
the
antilles
to
wholly
different
localities
the
order
of
the
tales
in
the
present
work
follows
roughly
the
order
of
development
giving
first
the
legends
which
kept
near
the
european
shore
and
then
those
which
like
brandan
or
antillia
were
assigned
to
the
open
sea
or
like
norumbega
or
the
isle
of
demons
to
the
very
coast
of
america
every
tale
in
this
book
bears
reference
to
some
actual
legend
followed
more
or
less
closely
and
the
authorities
for
each
will
be
found
carefully
given
in
the
appendix
for
such
readers
as
may
care
to
follow
the
subject
farther
it
must
be
remembered
that
some
of
these
imaginary
islands
actually
remained
on
the
charts
of
the
british
admiralty
until
within
a
century
if
even
the
exact
science
of
geographers
retained
them
thus
long
surely
romance
should
embalm
them
forever

the
story
of
atlantis
the
greek
sage
socrates
when
he
was
but
a
boy
minding
his
goats
used
to
lie
on
the
grass
under
the
myrtle
trees
and
while
the
goats
grazed
around
him
he
loved
to
read
over
and
over
the
story
which
solon
the
and
poet
wrote
down
for
the
of
socrates
and
which
solon
had
always
meant
to
make
into
a
poem
though
he
died
without
doing
it
but
this
was
briefly
what
he
wrote
in
prose
i
solon
was
never
in
my
life
so
surprised
as
when
i
went
to
egypt
for
instruction
in
my
youth
and
there
in
the
temple
of
sais
saw
an
aged
priest
who
told
me
of
the
island
of
atlantis
which
was
sunk
in
the
sea
thousands
of
years
ago
he
said
that
in
the
division
of
the
earth
the
gods
agreed
that
the
god
poseidon
or
neptune
should
have
as
his
share
this
great
island
which
then
lay
in
the
ocean
west
of
the
mediterranean
sea
and
was
larger
than
all
asia
there
was
a
mortal
maiden
there
whom
poseidon
wished
to
marry
and
to
secure
her
he
surrounded
the
valley
where
she
dwelt
with
three
rings
of
sea
and
two
of
land
so
that
no
one
could
enter
and
he
made
underground
springs
with
water
hot
or
cold
and
supplied
all
things
needful
to
the
life
of
man
here
he
lived
with
her
for
many
years
and
they
had
ten
sons
and
these
sons
divided
the
island
among
them
and
had
many
children
who
dwelt
there
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
they
had
mines
of
gold
and
silver
and
pastures
for
elephants
and
many
fragrant
plants
they
erected
palaces
and
dug
canals
and
they
built
their
temples
of
white
red
and
black
stone
and
covered
them
with
gold
and
silver
in
these
were
statues
of
gold
especially
one
of
the
god
poseidon
driving
six
winged
horses
he
was
so
large
as
to
touch
the
roof
with
his
head
and
had
a
hundred
around
him
riding
on
dolphins
the
islanders
had
also
baths
and
gardens
and
and
they
had
twelve
hundred
ships
and
ten
thousand
chariots
all
this
was
in
the
royal
city
alone
and
the
people
were
friendly
and
good
and
towards
all
but
as
time
went
on
they
grew
less
so
and
they
did
not
obey
the
laws
so
that
they
offended
heaven
in
a
single
day
and
night
the
island
disappeared
and
sank
beneath
the
sea
and
this
is
why
the
sea
in
that
region
grew
so
impassable
and
impenetrable
because
there
is
a
quantity
of
shallow
mud
in
the
way
and
this
was
caused
by
the
sinking
of
a
single
vast
island
this
is
the
tale
said
solon
which
the
old
egyptian
priest
told
to
me
and
solon
tale
was
read
by
socrates
the
boy
as
he
lay
in
the
grass
and
he
told
it
to
his
friends
after
he
grew
up
as
is
written
in
his
dialogues
recorded
by
his
disciple
plato
and
though
this
great
island
of
atlantis
has
never
been
seen
again
yet
a
great
many
smaller
islands
have
been
found
in
the
atlantic
ocean
and
they
have
sometimes
been
lost
to
sight
and
found
again
there
is
also
in
this
ocean
a
vast
tract
of
floating
seaweed
called
by
sailors
the
sargasso
sea
covering
a
region
as
large
as
france
and
this
has
been
thought
by
many
to
mark
the
place
of
a
sunken
island
there
are
also
many
islands
such
as
the
azores
which
have
been
supposed
at
different
times
to
be
fragments
of
atlantis
and
besides
all
this
the
remains
of
the
vanished
island
have
been
looked
for
in
all
parts
of
the
world
some
writers
have
thought
it
was
in
sweden
others
in
spitzbergen
others
in
africa
in
palestine
in
america
since
the
depth
of
the
atlantic
has
been
more
thoroughly
sounded
a
few
writers
have
maintained
that
the
inequalities
of
its
floor
show
some
traces
of
the
submerged
atlantis
but
the
general
opinion
of
men
of
science
is
quite
the
other
way
the
visible
atlantic
islands
are
all
or
almost
all
they
say
of
volcanic
origin
and
though
there
are
ridges
in
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
they
do
not
connect
the
continents
at
any
rate
this
was
the
original
story
of
atlantis
and
the
legends
which
follow
in
these
pages
have
doubtless
all
grown
more
or
less
out
of
this
first
tale
which
socrates
told
ii
taliessin
of
the
radiant
brow
in
times
past
there
were
enchanted
islands
in
the
atlantic
ocean
off
the
coast
of
wales
and
even
now
the
fishermen
sometimes
think
they
see
them
on
one
of
these
there
lived
a
man
named
tegid
voel
and
his
wife
called
cardiwen
they
had
a
son
the
ugliest
boy
in
the
world
and
cardiwen
formed
a
plan
to
make
him
more
attractive
by
teaching
him
all
possible
wisdom
she
was
a
great
magician
and
resolved
to
boil
a
large
caldron
full
of
knowledge
for
her
son
so
that
he
might
know
all
things
and
be
able
to
predict
all
that
was
to
happen
then
she
thought
people
would
value
him
in
spite
of
his
ugliness
but
she
knew
that
the
caldron
must
burn
a
year
and
a
day
without
ceasing
until
three
blessed
drops
of
the
water
of
knowledge
were
obtained
from
it
and
those
three
drops
would
give
all
the
wisdom
she
wanted
so
she
put
a
boy
named
gwion
to
stir
the
caldron
and
a
blind
man
named
morda
to
feed
the
fire
and
made
them
promise
never
to
let
it
cease
boiling
for
a
year
and
a
day
she
herself
kept
gathering
magic
herbs
and
putting
them
into
it
one
day
when
the
year
was
nearly
over
it
chanced
that
three
drops
of
the
liquor
flew
out
of
the
caldron
and
fell
on
the
finger
of
gwion
they
were
fiery
hot
and
he
put
his
finger
to
his
mouth
and
the
instant
he
tasted
them
he
knew
that
they
were
the
enchanted
drops
for
which
so
much
trouble
had
been
taken
by
their
magic
he
at
once
foresaw
all
that
was
to
come
and
especially
that
cardiwen
the
enchantress
would
never
forgive
him
then
gwion
fled
the
caldron
burst
in
two
and
all
the
liquor
flowed
forth
poisoning
some
horses
which
drank
it
these
horses
belonged
to
a
king
named
gwyddno
cardiwen
came
in
and
saw
all
the
toil
of
the
whole
year
lost
seizing
a
stick
of
wood
she
struck
the
blind
man
morda
fiercely
on
the
head
but
he
said
i
am
innocent
it
was
not
i
who
did
it
true
said
cardiwen
it
was
the
boy
gwion
who
robbed
me
and
she
rushed
to
pursue
him
he
saw
her
and
fled
changing
into
a
hare
but
she
became
a
greyhound
and
followed
him
running
to
the
water
he
became
a
fish
but
she
became
another
and
chased
him
below
the
waves
he
turned
himself
into
a
bird
when
she
became
a
hawk
and
gave
him
no
rest
in
the
sky
just
as
she
swooped
on
him
he
espied
a
pile
of
winnowed
wheat
on
the
floor
of
a
barn
and
dropping
upon
it
he
became
one
of
the
changing
herself
into
a
black
hen
cardiwen
scratched
him
up
and
swallowed
him
when
he
changed
at
last
into
a
boy
again
and
was
so
beautiful
that
she
could
not
kill
him
outright
but
wrapped
him
in
a
leathern
bag
and
cast
him
into
the
sea
committing
him
to
the
mercy
of
god
this
was
on
the
of
april
now
gwyddno
had
a
weir
for
catching
fish
on
the
near
his
castle
and
every
day
in
may
he
was
wont
to
take
a
hundred
pounds
worth
of
fish
he
had
a
son
named
elphin
who
was
always
poor
and
unsuccessful
but
that
year
the
father
had
given
the
son
leave
to
draw
all
the
fish
from
the
weir
to
see
if
good
luck
would
ever
befall
him
and
give
him
something
with
which
to
begin
the
world
when
elphin
went
next
to
draw
the
weir
the
man
who
had
charge
of
it
said
in
pity
thou
art
always
unlucky
there
is
nothing
in
the
weir
but
a
leathern
bag
which
is
caught
on
one
of
the
poles
how
do
we
know
said
elphin
that
it
may
not
contain
the
value
of
a
hundred
pounds
taking
up
the
bag
and
opening
it
the
man
saw
the
forehead
of
the
boy
and
said
to
elphin
behold
what
a
radiant
brow
taliessin
let
him
be
called
taliessin
said
elphin
then
he
lifted
the
boy
and
placed
him
sorrowfully
behind
him
and
made
his
horse
amble
gently
that
before
had
been
trotting
and
carried
him
as
softly
as
if
he
had
been
sitting
in
the
easiest
chair
in
the
world
and
the
boy
of
the
radiant
brow
made
a
song
to
elphin
as
they
went
along
never
in
gwyddno
weir
was
there
such
good
luck
as
this
night
fair
elphin
dry
thy
cheeks
being
too
sad
will
not
avail
although
thou
thinkest
thou
hast
no
gain
too
much
grief
will
bring
thee
no
good
nor
doubt
the
miracles
of
the
almighty
although
i
am
but
little
i
am
highly
gifted
from
seas
and
from
mountains
and
from
the
depths
of
rivers
god
brings
wealth
to
the
fortunate
man
elphin
of
lively
qualities
thy
resolution
is
unmanly
thou
must
not
be
oversorrowful
better
to
trust
in
god
than
to
forebode
weak
and
small
as
i
am
on
the
foaming
beach
of
the
ocean
in
the
day
of
trouble
i
shall
be
of
more
service
to
thee
than
three
hundred
salmon
elphin
of
notable
qualities
be
not
displeased
at
thy
misfortune
although
reclined
thus
weak
in
my
bag
there
lies
a
virtue
in
my
tongue
while
i
continue
thy
protector
thou
hast
not
much
to
fear
then
elphin
asked
him
art
thou
man
or
spirit
and
in
answer
the
boy
sang
to
him
this
tale
of
his
flight
from
the
woman
i
have
fled
with
vigor
i
have
fled
as
a
frog
i
have
fled
in
the
semblance
of
a
crow
scarcely
finding
rest
i
have
fled
vehemently
i
have
fled
as
a
chain
of
lightning
i
have
fled
as
a
roe
into
an
entangled
thicket
i
have
fled
as
a
i
have
fled
as
a
wolf
in
the
wilderness
i
have
fled
as
a
fox
used
to
many
swift
bounds
and
quirks
i
have
fled
as
a
martin
which
did
not
avail
i
have
fled
as
a
squirrel
that
vainly
hides
i
have
fled
as
a
stag
antler
of
ruddy
course
i
have
fled
as
an
iron
in
a
glowing
fire
i
have
fled
as
a
of
woe
to
such
as
have
a
wish
for
it
i
have
fled
as
a
fierce
bull
bitterly
fighting
i
have
fled
as
a
bristly
boar
seen
in
a
ravine
i
have
fled
as
a
white
grain
of
pure
wheat
into
a
dark
leathern
bag
i
was
thrown
and
on
a
boundless
sea
i
was
sent
adrift
which
was
to
me
an
omen
of
being
tenderly
nursed
and
the
lord
god
then
set
me
at
liberty
then
elphin
came
with
taliessin
to
the
house
of
his
father
and
gwyddno
asked
him
if
he
had
a
good
haul
at
the
i
have
something
better
than
fish
what
is
that
asked
the
father
i
have
a
bard
said
elphin
alas
what
will
he
profit
thee
said
gwyddno
to
which
taliessin
replied
he
will
profit
him
more
than
the
weir
ever
profited
thee
said
gwyddno
art
thou
able
to
speak
and
thou
so
little
then
taliessin
said
i
am
better
able
to
speak
than
thou
to
question
me
from
this
time
elphin
always
prospered
and
he
and
his
wife
cared
for
taliessin
tenderly
and
lovingly
and
the
boy
dwelt
with
him
until
he
was
thirteen
years
old
when
elphin
went
to
make
a
christmas
visit
to
his
uncle
maelgwyn
who
was
a
great
king
and
held
open
court
there
were
four
and
twenty
bards
there
and
all
proclaimed
that
no
king
had
a
wife
so
beautiful
as
the
queen
or
a
bard
so
wise
as
the
who
all
agreed
upon
this
decision
elphin
said
on
the
contrary
that
it
was
he
himself
who
had
the
most
beautiful
wife
and
the
wisest
bard
and
for
this
he
was
thrown
into
prison
taliessin
learning
this
set
forth
from
home
to
visit
the
palace
and
free
his
adoptive
father
elphin
in
those
days
it
was
the
custom
of
kings
to
sit
in
the
hall
and
dine
in
royal
state
with
lords
and
bards
about
them
who
should
keep
proclaiming
the
greatness
and
glory
of
the
king
and
his
knights
taliessin
placed
himself
in
a
quiet
corner
waiting
for
the
four
and
twenty
bards
to
pass
and
as
each
one
passed
by
taliessin
made
an
ugly
face
and
gave
a
sound
with
his
finger
on
his
lips
thus
blerwm
blerwm
each
bard
went
by
and
bowed
himself
before
the
king
but
instead
of
beginning
to
chant
his
praises
could
only
play
blerwm
blerwm
on
the
lips
as
the
boy
had
done
the
king
was
amazed
and
thought
they
must
be
intoxicated
so
he
sent
one
of
his
lords
to
them
telling
them
to
behave
themselves
and
remember
where
they
were
twice
and
thrice
he
told
them
but
they
could
only
repeat
the
same
foolishness
until
at
last
the
king
ordered
one
of
his
squires
to
give
a
blow
to
the
chief
bard
and
the
squire
struck
him
a
blow
with
a
broom
so
that
he
fell
back
on
his
seat
then
he
arose
and
knelt
before
the
king
and
said
oh
honorable
king
be
it
known
unto
your
grace
that
it
is
not
from
too
much
drinking
that
we
are
dumb
but
through
the
influence
of
a
spirit
which
sits
in
the
corner
yonder
in
the
form
of
a
child
then
the
king
bade
a
squire
to
bring
taliessin
before
him
and
he
asked
the
boy
who
he
was
he
answered
primary
chief
bard
i
am
to
elphin
and
my
original
country
is
the
region
of
the
summer
stars
i
am
a
wonder
whose
origin
is
not
known
i
have
been
fostered
in
the
land
of
the
deity
i
have
been
teacher
to
all
intelligences
i
am
able
to
instruct
the
whole
universe
i
was
originally
little
gwion
and
at
length
i
am
taliessin
then
the
king
and
his
nobles
wondered
much
for
they
had
never
heard
the
like
from
a
boy
so
young
the
king
then
called
his
wisest
bard
to
answer
taliessin
but
he
could
only
play
blerwm
on
his
lips
as
before
and
each
of
the
king
four
and
twenty
bards
tried
in
the
same
way
and
could
do
nothing
more
then
the
king
bade
taliessin
sing
again
and
he
began
discover
thou
what
is
the
strong
creature
from
before
the
flood
without
flesh
without
bone
without
vein
without
blood
without
head
without
feet
it
will
neither
be
older
nor
younger
than
at
the
beginning
great
god
how
the
sea
whitens
when
first
it
comes
great
are
its
gusts
when
it
comes
from
the
south
great
are
its
evaporations
when
it
strikes
on
coasts
it
is
in
the
field
it
is
in
the
wood
without
hand
and
without
foot
without
signs
of
old
age
it
is
also
so
wide
as
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
it
was
not
born
nor
was
it
seen
it
will
cause
consternation
wherever
god
willeth
on
sea
and
on
land
it
neither
sees
nor
is
seen
its
course
is
devious
and
will
not
come
when
desired
on
land
and
on
sea
it
is
indispensable
it
is
without
equal
it
is
it
is
not
confined
it
is
incomparable
it
comes
from
four
quarters
it
is
noxious
it
is
beneficial
it
is
yonder
it
is
here
it
will
decompose
but
it
will
not
repair
the
injury
it
will
not
suffer
for
its
doings
seeing
it
is
blameless
one
being
has
prepared
it
out
of
all
creatures
by
a
tremendous
blast
to
wreak
vengeance
on
maelgwyn
gwynedd
and
while
he
was
thus
singing
his
verse
near
the
door
there
came
suddenly
a
mighty
storm
of
wind
so
that
the
king
and
all
his
nobles
thought
the
castle
would
fall
on
their
heads
they
saw
that
taliessin
had
not
merely
been
singing
the
song
of
the
wind
but
seemed
to
have
power
to
command
it
then
the
king
hastily
ordered
that
elphin
should
be
brought
from
his
dungeon
and
placed
before
taliessin
and
the
chains
came
loose
from
his
feet
and
he
was
set
free
as
they
rode
away
from
the
court
the
king
and
his
courtiers
rode
with
them
and
taliessin
bade
elphin
propose
a
race
with
the
king
horses
four
and
twenty
horses
were
chosen
and
taliessin
got
four
and
twenty
twigs
of
holly
which
he
had
burnt
black
and
he
ordered
the
youth
who
was
to
ride
elphin
horse
to
let
all
the
others
set
off
before
him
and
bade
him
as
he
overtook
each
horse
to
strike
him
with
a
holly
twig
and
throw
it
down
then
he
had
him
watch
where
his
own
horse
should
stumble
and
throw
down
his
cap
at
the
place
the
race
being
won
taliessin
brought
his
master
to
the
spot
where
the
cap
lay
and
put
workmen
to
dig
a
hole
there
when
they
had
dug
deeply
enough
they
found
a
caldron
full
of
gold
and
taliessin
said
elphin
this
is
my
payment
to
thee
for
having
taken
me
from
the
water
and
reared
me
until
now
and
on
this
spot
stands
a
pool
of
water
until
this
day
iii
the
of
lir
king
lir
of
erin
had
four
young
children
who
were
cared
for
tenderly
at
first
by
their
stepmother
the
new
queen
but
there
came
a
time
when
she
grew
jealous
of
the
love
their
father
bore
them
and
resolved
that
she
would
endure
it
no
longer
sometimes
there
was
murder
in
her
heart
but
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
that
wickedness
and
she
resolved
at
last
to
choose
another
way
to
rid
herself
of
them
one
day
she
took
them
to
drive
in
her
chariot
finola
who
was
eight
years
old
with
her
three
younger
brothers
aodh
fiacre
and
little
conn
still
a
baby
they
were
beautiful
children
the
legend
says
with
skins
white
and
soft
as
feathers
and
with
large
blue
eyes
and
very
sweet
voices
reaching
a
lake
she
told
them
that
they
might
bathe
in
the
clear
water
but
so
soon
as
they
were
in
it
she
struck
them
with
a
fairy
wand
for
she
was
of
the
race
of
the
druids
who
had
magical
power
and
she
turned
them
into
four
beautiful
swans
but
they
still
had
human
voices
and
finola
said
to
her
this
wicked
deed
of
thine
shall
be
punished
for
the
doom
that
awaits
thee
will
surely
be
worse
than
ours
then
finola
asked
how
long
shall
we
be
in
the
shape
of
swans
for
three
hundred
years
said
the
woman
on
smooth
lake
darvra
then
three
hundred
years
on
the
sea
of
moyle
this
being
the
sea
between
ireland
and
scotland
and
then
three
hundred
years
at
inis
glora
in
the
great
western
sea
this
was
a
rocky
island
in
the
atlantic
until
the
tailkenn
patrick
shall
come
to
ireland
and
bring
the
christian
faith
and
until
you
hear
the
christian
bell
you
shall
not
be
freed
neither
your
power
nor
mine
can
now
bring
you
back
to
human
shape
but
you
shall
keep
your
human
reason
and
your
gaelic
speech
and
you
shall
sing
music
so
sweet
that
all
who
hear
it
shall
gladly
listen
she
left
them
and
ere
long
their
father
king
lir
came
to
the
shore
and
heard
their
singing
he
asked
how
they
came
to
have
human
voices
we
are
thy
four
children
said
finola
changed
into
swans
by
our
jealousy
then
come
and
live
with
me
said
her
sorrowing
father
we
are
not
permitted
to
leave
the
lake
she
said
or
live
with
our
people
any
more
but
we
are
allowed
to
dwell
together
and
to
keep
our
reason
and
our
speech
and
to
sing
sweet
music
to
you
then
they
sang
and
the
king
and
all
his
followers
were
at
first
amazed
and
then
lulled
to
sleep
then
king
lir
returned
and
met
the
cruel
stepmother
at
her
palace
when
her
father
king
bove
was
told
what
she
had
done
he
was
hot
with
anger
this
wicked
deed
he
said
shall
bring
severer
punishment
on
thee
than
on
the
innocent
children
for
their
suffering
shall
end
but
thine
never
shall
then
king
bove
asked
her
what
form
of
existence
would
be
most
terrible
to
her
she
replied
that
of
a
demon
of
the
air
be
it
so
said
her
father
who
had
also
druidical
power
he
struck
her
with
his
wand
and
she
became
a
bat
and
flew
away
with
a
scream
and
the
legend
says
she
is
still
a
demon
of
the
air
and
shall
be
a
demon
of
the
air
until
the
end
of
time
after
this
the
people
of
all
the
races
that
were
in
erin
used
to
come
and
encamp
by
the
lake
and
listen
to
the
swans
the
happy
were
made
happier
by
the
song
and
those
who
were
in
grief
or
illness
or
pain
forgot
their
sorrows
and
were
lulled
to
rest
there
was
peace
in
all
that
region
while
war
and
tumult
filled
other
lands
vast
changes
took
place
in
three
centuries
towers
and
castles
rose
and
fell
villages
were
built
and
destroyed
generations
were
born
and
died
and
still
the
lived
and
sang
until
at
the
end
of
three
hundred
years
they
flew
away
as
was
decreed
to
the
stormy
sea
of
moyle
and
from
that
time
it
was
made
a
law
that
no
one
should
kill
a
swan
in
erin
beside
the
sea
of
moyle
they
found
no
longer
the
peaceful
and
wooded
shores
they
had
known
but
only
steep
and
rocky
coasts
and
a
wild
wild
sea
there
came
a
great
storm
one
night
and
the
swans
knew
that
they
could
not
keep
together
so
they
resolved
that
if
separated
they
would
meet
at
a
rock
called
carricknarone
finola
reached
there
first
and
took
her
brothers
under
her
wings
all
wet
shivering
and
exhausted
many
such
nights
followed
and
in
one
terrible
winter
storm
when
they
nestled
together
on
carricknarone
the
water
froze
into
solid
ice
around
them
and
their
feet
and
wings
were
so
frozen
to
the
rock
that
when
they
moved
they
left
the
skin
of
their
feet
the
quills
of
their
wings
and
the
feathers
of
their
breasts
clinging
there
when
the
ice
melted
and
they
swam
out
into
the
sea
their
bodies
smarted
with
pain
until
the
feathers
grew
once
more
one
day
they
saw
a
glittering
troop
of
horsemen
approaching
along
the
shore
and
knew
that
they
were
their
own
kindred
though
from
far
generations
back
the
dedannen
or
fairy
host
they
greeted
each
other
with
joy
for
the
fairy
host
had
been
sent
to
seek
for
the
swans
and
on
returning
to
their
chiefs
they
narrated
what
had
passed
and
the
chiefs
said
we
can
not
help
them
but
we
are
glad
they
are
living
and
we
know
that
at
last
the
enchantment
will
be
broken
and
that
they
will
be
freed
from
their
sorrows
so
passed
their
lives
until
finola
sang
one
day
the
second
woe
has
passed
the
second
period
of
three
hundred
years
when
they
flew
out
on
the
broad
ocean
as
was
decreed
and
went
to
the
island
of
inis
glora
there
they
spent
the
next
three
hundred
years
amid
yet
wilder
storms
and
yet
colder
winds
no
more
the
peaceful
shepherds
and
living
neighbors
were
around
them
but
often
the
sailor
and
fisherman
in
his
little
coracle
saw
the
white
gleam
of
their
wings
or
heard
the
sweet
notes
of
their
song
and
knew
that
the
children
of
lir
were
near
but
the
time
came
when
the
nine
hundred
years
of
banishment
were
ended
and
they
might
fly
back
to
their
father
old
home
finnahà
flying
for
days
above
the
sea
they
alighted
at
the
palace
once
so
well
known
but
everything
was
changed
by
time
even
the
walls
of
their
father
palace
were
crumbled
and
so
sad
was
the
sight
that
they
remained
one
day
only
and
flew
back
to
inis
glora
thinking
that
if
they
must
be
forever
solitary
they
would
live
where
they
had
lived
last
not
where
they
had
been
reared
one
may
morning
as
the
children
of
lir
floated
in
the
air
around
the
island
of
inis
glora
they
heard
a
faint
bell
sounding
across
the
eastern
sea
the
mist
lifted
and
they
saw
afar
off
beyond
the
waves
a
vision
of
a
stately
priest
with
attendants
around
him
on
the
irish
shore
they
knew
that
it
must
be
patrick
the
tailkenn
or
tonsured
one
who
was
bringing
as
had
been
so
long
promised
christianity
to
ireland
sailing
through
the
air
above
the
blue
sea
towards
their
native
coast
they
heard
the
bell
once
more
now
near
and
distinct
and
they
knew
that
all
evil
spirits
were
fleeing
away
and
that
their
own
hopes
were
to
be
fulfilled
as
they
approached
the
land
patrick
stretched
his
hand
and
said
children
of
lir
you
may
tread
your
native
land
again
and
the
sweet
finola
said
if
we
tread
our
native
land
it
can
only
be
to
die
after
our
life
of
nine
centuries
baptize
us
while
we
are
yet
living
when
they
touched
the
shore
the
weight
of
all
those
centuries
fell
upon
them
they
resumed
their
human
bodies
but
they
appeared
old
and
pale
and
wrinkled
then
patrick
baptized
them
and
they
died
but
even
as
he
did
so
a
change
swiftly
came
over
them
and
they
lay
side
by
side
once
more
children
in
their
white
as
when
their
father
lir
long
centuries
ago
had
kissed
them
at
evening
and
seen
their
blue
eyes
close
in
sleep
and
had
touched
with
gentle
hand
their
white
foreheads
and
their
golden
hair
their
time
of
sorrow
was
ended
and
their
last
was
sung
but
the
cruel
stepmother
seems
yet
to
survive
in
her
shape
and
a
single
glance
at
her
weird
and
malicious
little
face
will
lead
us
to
doubt
whether
she
has
yet
fully
atoned
for
her
sin
iv
usheen
in
the
island
of
youth
the
old
celtic
hero
and
poet
usheen
or
oisin
whose
supposed
songs
are
known
in
english
as
those
of
ossian
lived
to
a
great
old
age
surviving
all
others
of
the
race
of
the
feni
to
which
he
belonged
and
he
was
asked
in
his
last
years
what
had
given
him
such
length
of
life
this
is
the
tale
he
told
after
the
fatal
battle
of
gavra
in
which
most
of
the
feni
were
killed
usheen
and
his
father
the
king
and
some
of
the
survivors
of
the
battle
were
hunting
the
deer
with
their
dogs
when
they
met
a
maiden
riding
on
a
slender
white
horse
with
hoofs
of
gold
and
with
a
golden
crescent
between
his
ears
the
maiden
hair
was
of
the
color
of
citron
and
was
gathered
in
a
silver
band
and
she
was
clad
in
a
white
garment
embroidered
with
strange
devices
she
asked
them
why
they
rode
slowly
and
seemed
sad
and
not
like
other
hunters
and
they
replied
that
it
was
because
of
the
death
of
their
friends
and
the
ruin
of
their
race
when
they
asked
her
in
turn
whence
she
came
and
why
and
whether
she
was
married
she
replied
that
she
had
never
had
a
lover
or
a
husband
but
that
she
had
crossed
the
sea
for
the
love
of
the
great
hero
and
bard
usheen
whom
she
had
never
seen
then
usheen
was
overcome
with
love
for
her
but
she
said
that
to
wed
her
he
must
follow
her
across
the
sea
to
the
island
of
perpetual
youth
there
he
would
have
a
hundred
horses
and
a
hundred
sheep
and
a
hundred
silken
robes
a
hundred
swords
a
hundred
bows
and
a
hundred
youths
to
follow
him
while
she
would
have
a
hundred
maidens
to
wait
on
her
but
how
he
asked
was
he
to
reach
this
island
he
was
to
mount
her
horse
and
ride
behind
her
so
he
did
this
and
the
slender
white
horse
not
feeling
his
weight
dashed
across
the
waves
of
the
ocean
which
did
not
yield
beneath
his
tread
they
galloped
across
the
very
sea
and
the
maiden
whose
name
was
niam
sang
to
him
as
they
rode
and
this
so
enchantingly
that
he
scarcely
knew
whether
hours
passed
or
days
sometimes
deer
ran
by
them
over
the
water
followed
by
hounds
in
full
chase
sometimes
a
maiden
holding
up
an
apple
of
gold
sometimes
a
beautiful
youth
but
they
themselves
rode
on
always
westward
at
last
they
drew
near
an
island
which
was
not
niam
said
the
island
they
were
seeking
but
it
was
one
where
a
beautiful
princess
was
kept
under
a
spell
until
some
defender
should
slay
a
cruel
giant
who
held
her
under
enchantment
until
she
should
either
wed
him
or
furnish
a
defender
the
youth
usheen
being
an
irishman
and
not
easily
frightened
naturally
offered
his
services
as
defender
and
they
waited
three
days
and
nights
to
carry
on
the
conflict
he
had
fought
at
home
so
the
legend
says
with
wild
boars
with
foreign
invaders
and
with
enchanters
but
he
never
had
quite
so
severe
a
contest
as
with
this
giant
but
after
he
had
cut
off
his
opponent
head
and
had
been
healed
with
precious
balm
by
the
beautiful
princess
he
buried
the
giant
body
in
a
deep
grave
and
placed
above
it
a
great
stone
engraved
in
the
ogham
alphabet
in
which
all
the
letters
are
given
in
straight
lines
after
this
he
and
niam
again
mounted
the
white
steed
and
galloped
away
over
the
waves
niam
was
again
singing
when
soft
music
began
to
be
heard
in
the
distance
as
if
in
the
centre
of
the
setting
sun
they
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
a
shore
where
the
very
trees
trembled
with
the
multitude
of
birds
that
sang
upon
them
and
when
they
reached
the
shore
niam
gave
one
note
of
song
and
a
band
of
youths
and
maidens
came
rushing
towards
them
and
embraced
them
with
eagerness
then
they
too
sang
and
as
they
did
it
one
brought
to
usheen
a
harp
of
silver
and
bade
him
sing
of
earthly
joys
he
found
himself
chanting
as
he
thought
with
peculiar
spirit
and
melody
but
as
he
told
them
of
human
joys
they
kept
still
and
began
to
weep
till
at
last
one
of
them
seized
the
silver
harp
and
flung
it
away
into
a
pool
of
water
saying
it
is
the
saddest
harp
in
all
the
world
then
he
forgot
all
the
human
joys
which
seemed
to
those
happy
people
only
as
sorrows
compared
with
their
own
and
he
dwelt
with
them
thenceforward
in
perpetual
youth
for
a
hundred
years
he
chased
the
deer
and
went
fishing
in
strangely
carved
boats
and
joined
in
the
athletic
sports
of
the
young
men
for
a
hundred
years
the
gentle
niam
was
his
wife
but
one
day
when
usheen
was
by
the
beach
there
floated
to
his
feet
what
seemed
a
wooden
staff
and
he
drew
it
from
the
waves
it
was
the
battered
fragment
of
a
warrior
lance
the
blood
stains
of
war
were
still
on
it
and
as
he
looked
at
it
he
recalled
the
old
days
of
the
feni
the
wars
and
tumult
of
his
youth
and
how
he
had
outlived
his
tribe
and
all
had
passed
away
niam
came
softly
to
him
and
rested
against
his
shoulder
but
it
did
not
soothe
his
pain
and
he
heard
one
of
the
young
men
watching
him
say
to
another
the
human
sadness
has
come
back
into
his
eyes
the
people
around
stood
watching
him
all
sharing
his
sorrow
and
knowing
that
his
time
of
happiness
was
over
and
that
he
would
go
back
among
men
so
indeed
it
was
niam
and
usheen
mounted
the
white
steed
again
and
galloped
away
over
the
sea
but
she
had
warned
him
when
they
mounted
that
he
must
never
dismount
for
an
instant
for
that
if
he
once
touched
the
earth
she
and
the
steed
would
vanish
forever
that
his
youth
too
would
disappear
and
that
he
would
be
left
alone
on
earth
an
old
man
whose
whole
generation
had
vanished
they
passed
as
before
over
the
sea
the
same
visions
hovered
around
them
youths
and
maidens
and
animals
of
the
chase
they
passed
by
many
islands
and
at
last
reached
the
shore
of
erin
again
as
they
travelled
over
its
plains
and
among
its
hills
oisin
looked
in
vain
for
his
old
companions
a
little
people
had
taken
their
place
small
men
and
women
mounted
on
horses
as
small
and
these
people
gazed
in
wonder
at
the
mighty
usheen
we
have
heard
they
said
of
the
hero
finn
and
the
poets
have
written
many
tales
of
him
and
of
his
people
the
feni
we
have
read
in
old
books
that
he
had
a
son
usheen
who
went
away
with
a
fairy
maiden
but
he
was
never
seen
again
and
there
is
no
race
of
the
feni
left
yet
refusing
to
believe
this
and
always
looking
round
for
the
people
whom
he
had
known
and
loved
of
old
he
thought
within
himself
that
perhaps
the
feni
were
not
to
be
seen
because
they
were
hunting
fierce
wolves
by
night
as
they
used
to
do
in
his
boyhood
and
that
they
were
therefore
sleeping
in
the
daytime
but
again
an
old
man
said
to
him
the
feni
are
dead
then
he
remembered
that
it
was
a
hundred
years
and
that
his
very
race
had
perished
and
he
turned
with
contempt
on
the
little
men
and
their
little
horses
three
hundred
of
them
as
he
rode
by
were
trying
to
lift
a
vast
stone
but
they
staggered
under
its
weight
and
at
last
fell
and
lay
beneath
it
then
leaning
from
his
saddle
usheen
lifted
the
stone
with
one
hand
and
flung
it
five
yards
but
with
the
strain
the
saddle
girth
broke
and
usheen
came
to
the
ground
the
white
steed
shook
himself
and
neighed
then
galloped
away
bearing
niam
with
him
and
usheen
lay
with
all
his
strength
gone
from
him
a
feeble
old
man
the
island
of
youth
could
only
be
known
by
those
who
dwelt
always
within
it
and
those
mortals
who
had
once
left
it
could
dwell
there
no
more
v
bran
the
blessed
the
mighty
king
bran
a
being
of
gigantic
size
sat
one
day
on
the
cliffs
of
his
island
in
the
atlantic
ocean
near
to
hades
and
the
gates
of
night
when
he
saw
ships
sailing
towards
him
and
sent
men
to
ask
what
they
were
they
were
a
fleet
sent
by
matholweh
the
king
of
ireland
who
had
sent
to
ask
for
branwen
bran
sister
as
his
wife
without
moving
from
his
rock
bran
bid
the
monarch
land
and
sent
branwen
back
with
him
as
queen
but
there
came
a
time
when
branwen
was
at
the
palace
they
sent
her
into
the
kitchen
and
made
her
cook
for
the
court
and
they
caused
the
butcher
to
come
every
day
after
he
had
cut
up
the
meat
and
give
her
a
blow
on
the
ear
they
also
drew
up
all
their
boats
on
the
shore
for
three
years
that
she
might
not
send
for
her
brother
but
she
reared
a
starling
in
the
cover
of
the
taught
it
to
speak
and
told
it
how
to
find
her
brother
and
then
she
wrote
a
letter
describing
her
sorrows
and
bound
it
to
the
bird
wing
and
it
flew
to
the
island
and
alighted
on
bran
shoulder
ruffling
its
feathers
says
the
welsh
legend
so
that
the
letter
was
seen
and
they
knew
that
the
bird
had
been
reared
in
a
domestic
manner
then
bran
resolved
to
cross
the
sea
but
he
had
to
wade
through
the
water
as
no
ship
had
yet
been
built
large
enough
to
hold
him
and
he
carried
all
his
musicians
pipers
on
his
shoulders
as
he
approached
the
irish
shore
men
ran
to
the
king
saying
that
they
had
seen
a
forest
on
the
sea
where
there
never
before
had
been
a
tree
and
that
they
had
also
seen
a
mountain
which
moved
then
the
king
asked
branwen
the
queen
what
it
could
be
she
answered
these
are
the
men
of
the
island
of
the
mighty
who
have
come
hither
to
protect
me
what
is
the
forest
they
asked
the
yards
and
masts
of
ships
what
mountain
is
that
by
the
side
of
the
ships
it
is
bran
my
brother
coming
to
the
shoal
water
and
rising
what
is
the
lofty
ridge
with
the
lake
on
each
side
that
is
his
nose
she
said
and
the
two
lakes
are
his
fierce
eyes
then
the
people
were
terrified
there
was
yet
a
river
for
bran
to
pass
and
they
broke
down
the
bridge
which
crossed
it
but
bran
laid
himself
down
and
said
who
will
be
a
chief
let
him
be
a
bridge
then
his
men
laid
hurdles
on
his
back
and
the
whole
army
crossed
over
and
that
saying
of
his
became
afterwards
a
proverb
then
the
irish
resolved
in
order
to
appease
the
mighty
visitor
to
build
him
a
house
because
he
had
never
before
had
one
that
would
hold
him
and
they
decided
to
make
the
house
large
enough
to
contain
the
two
armies
one
on
each
side
they
accordingly
built
this
house
and
there
were
a
hundred
pillars
and
the
builders
treacherously
hung
a
leathern
bag
on
each
side
of
each
pillar
and
put
an
armed
man
inside
of
each
so
that
they
could
all
rise
by
night
and
kill
the
sleepers
but
bran
brother
who
was
a
suspicious
man
asked
the
builders
what
was
in
the
first
bag
meal
good
soul
they
answered
and
he
putting
his
hand
in
felt
a
man
head
and
crushed
it
with
his
mighty
fingers
and
so
with
the
next
and
the
next
and
with
the
whole
two
hundred
after
this
it
did
not
take
long
to
bring
on
a
quarrel
between
the
two
armies
and
they
fought
all
day
after
this
great
fight
between
the
men
of
ireland
and
the
men
of
the
isles
of
the
mighty
there
were
but
seven
of
these
last
who
escaped
besides
their
king
bran
who
was
wounded
in
the
foot
with
a
poisoned
dart
then
he
knew
that
he
should
soon
die
but
he
bade
the
seven
men
to
cut
off
his
head
and
told
them
that
they
must
always
carry
it
with
them
that
it
would
never
decay
and
would
always
be
able
to
speak
and
be
pleasant
company
for
them
a
long
time
will
you
be
on
the
road
he
said
in
harlech
you
will
feast
seven
years
the
birds
of
rhiannon
singing
to
you
all
the
while
and
at
the
island
of
gwales
you
will
dwell
for
fourscore
years
and
you
may
remain
there
bearing
the
head
with
you
uncorrupted
until
you
open
the
door
that
looks
towards
the
mainland
and
after
you
have
once
opened
that
door
you
can
stay
no
longer
but
must
set
forth
to
london
to
bury
the
head
leaving
it
there
to
look
toward
france
so
they
went
on
to
harlech
and
there
stopped
to
rest
and
sat
down
to
eat
and
drink
and
there
came
three
birds
which
began
singing
a
certain
song
and
all
the
songs
they
had
ever
heard
were
unpleasant
compared
with
it
and
the
songs
seemed
to
them
to
be
at
a
great
distance
from
them
over
the
sea
yet
the
notes
were
heard
as
distinctly
as
if
they
were
close
by
and
it
is
said
that
at
this
repast
they
continued
seven
years
at
the
close
of
this
time
they
went
forth
to
an
island
in
the
sea
called
gwales
there
they
found
a
fair
and
regal
spot
overlooking
the
ocean
and
a
spacious
hall
built
for
them
they
went
into
it
and
found
two
of
its
doors
open
but
the
third
door
looking
toward
cornwall
was
closed
see
yonder
said
their
leader
manawydan
that
is
the
door
we
may
not
open
and
that
night
they
regaled
themselves
and
were
joyful
and
of
all
they
had
seen
of
food
laid
before
them
and
of
all
they
had
heard
said
they
remembered
nothing
neither
of
that
nor
of
any
sorrow
whatsoever
there
they
remained
fourscore
years
unconscious
of
having
ever
spent
a
time
more
joyous
and
mirthful
and
they
were
not
more
weary
than
when
first
they
came
neither
did
they
any
of
them
know
the
time
they
had
been
there
it
was
not
more
irksome
for
them
to
have
the
head
with
them
than
if
bran
the
blessed
had
been
with
them
himself
and
because
of
these
fourscore
years
it
was
called
the
entertaining
of
the
noble
head
one
day
said
heilwyn
the
son
of
gwyn
evil
betide
me
if
i
do
not
open
the
door
to
know
if
that
is
true
which
is
said
concerning
it
so
he
opened
the
door
and
looked
towards
cornwall
and
when
they
had
looked
they
were
as
conscious
of
all
the
evils
they
had
ever
sustained
and
of
all
the
friends
and
companions
they
had
ever
lost
and
of
all
the
misery
that
had
befallen
them
as
if
all
had
happened
in
that
very
spot
and
especially
of
the
fate
of
their
lord
and
because
of
their
perturbation
they
could
not
rest
but
journeyed
forth
with
the
head
towards
london
and
they
buried
the
head
in
the
white
mount
the
island
called
gwales
is
supposed
to
be
that
now
named
gresholm
eight
or
ten
miles
off
the
coast
of
pembrokeshire
and
to
this
day
the
welsh
sailors
on
that
coast
talk
of
the
green
meadows
of
enchantment
lying
out
at
sea
west
of
them
and
of
men
who
had
either
landed
on
them
or
seen
them
suddenly
vanishing
some
of
the
people
of
milford
used
to
declare
that
they
could
sometimes
see
the
green
islands
of
the
fairies
quite
distinctly
and
they
believed
that
the
fairies
went
to
and
fro
between
their
islands
and
the
shore
through
a
subterranean
gallery
under
the
sea
they
used
indeed
to
make
purchases
in
the
markets
of
milford
or
langhorne
and
this
they
did
sometimes
without
being
seen
and
always
without
speaking
for
they
seemed
to
know
the
prices
of
the
things
they
wished
to
buy
and
always
laid
down
the
exact
sum
of
money
needed
and
indeed
how
could
the
seven
companions
of
the
enchanted
head
have
spent
eighty
years
of
incessant
feasting
on
an
island
of
the
sea
without
sometimes
purchasing
supplies
from
the
mainland
vi
the
castle
of
the
active
door
perfect
is
my
chair
in
caer
sidi
plague
and
age
hurt
not
who
in
it
they
know
manawydan
and
pryderi
three
organs
round
a
fire
sing
before
it
and
about
its
points
are
ocean
streams
and
the
abundant
well
above
it
sweeter
than
white
wine
the
drink
in
it
peredur
the
knight
rode
through
the
wild
woods
of
the
enchanted
island
until
he
arrived
on
clear
ground
outside
the
forest
then
he
beheld
a
castle
on
level
ground
in
the
middle
of
a
meadow
and
round
the
castle
flowed
a
stream
and
inside
the
castle
there
were
large
and
spacious
halls
with
great
windows
drawing
nearer
the
castle
he
saw
it
to
be
turning
more
rapidly
than
any
wind
blows
on
the
ramparts
he
saw
archers
shooting
so
vigorously
that
no
armor
would
protect
against
them
there
were
also
men
blowing
horns
so
loud
that
the
earth
appeared
to
tremble
and
at
the
gates
were
lions
in
iron
chains
roaring
so
violently
that
one
might
fancy
that
the
castle
and
the
woods
were
ready
to
be
uprooted
neither
the
lions
nor
the
warriors
resisted
peredur
but
he
found
a
woman
sitting
by
the
gate
who
offered
to
carry
him
on
her
back
to
the
hall
this
was
the
queen
rhiannon
who
having
been
accused
of
having
caused
the
death
of
her
child
was
sentenced
to
remain
seven
years
sitting
by
the
gate
to
tell
her
story
to
every
one
and
to
offer
to
carry
all
strangers
on
her
back
into
the
castle
but
so
soon
as
peredur
had
entered
it
the
castle
vanished
away
and
he
found
himself
standing
on
the
bare
ground
the
queen
rhiannon
was
left
beside
him
and
she
remained
on
the
island
with
her
son
pryderi
and
his
wife
queen
rhiannon
married
for
her
second
husband
a
person
named
manawydan
one
day
they
ascended
a
mound
called
arberth
which
was
well
known
for
its
wonders
and
as
they
sat
there
they
heard
a
clap
of
thunder
followed
by
mist
so
thick
that
they
could
not
see
one
another
when
it
grew
light
again
they
looked
around
them
and
found
that
all
dwellings
and
animals
had
vanished
there
was
no
smoke
or
fire
anywhere
or
work
of
human
hands
all
their
household
had
disappeared
and
there
were
left
only
pryderi
and
manawydan
with
their
wives
wandering
from
place
to
place
they
found
no
human
beings
but
they
lived
by
hunting
fishing
and
gathering
wild
honey
after
visiting
foreign
lands
they
returned
to
their
island
home
one
day
when
they
were
out
hunting
a
wild
boar
of
pure
white
color
sprang
from
a
bush
and
as
they
saw
him
they
retreated
and
they
saw
also
the
turning
castle
the
boar
watching
his
opportunity
sprang
into
it
and
the
dogs
followed
and
pryderi
said
i
will
go
into
this
castle
and
get
tidings
of
the
dogs
go
not
said
manawydan
whoever
has
cast
a
spell
over
this
land
and
deprived
us
of
our
dwelling
has
placed
this
castle
here
but
pryderi
replied
of
a
truth
i
can
not
give
up
my
dogs
so
he
watched
for
the
opportunity
and
went
in
he
saw
neither
boar
nor
dogs
neither
man
nor
beast
but
on
the
centre
of
the
castle
floor
he
saw
a
fountain
with
marble
work
around
it
and
on
the
margin
of
the
fountain
a
golden
bowl
upon
a
marble
slab
and
in
the
air
hung
chains
of
which
he
could
see
no
end
he
was
much
delighted
with
the
beauty
of
the
gold
and
the
rich
workmanship
of
the
bowl
and
went
up
to
lay
hold
of
it
the
moment
he
touched
it
his
fingers
clung
to
the
bowl
and
his
feet
to
the
slab
and
all
his
joyousness
forsook
him
so
that
he
could
not
utter
a
word
and
thus
he
stood
manawydan
waited
for
him
until
evening
but
hearing
nothing
either
of
him
or
of
the
dogs
he
returned
home
when
he
entered
rhiannon
who
was
his
wife
and
who
was
also
pryderi
mother
looked
at
him
where
she
said
are
pryderi
and
the
dogs
this
is
what
has
happened
to
me
he
said
and
he
told
her
an
evil
companion
hast
thou
been
she
said
and
a
good
companion
hast
thou
lost
with
these
words
she
went
out
and
proceeded
towards
the
castle
of
the
active
door
getting
in
she
saw
pryderi
taking
hold
of
the
bowl
and
she
went
towards
him
what
dost
thou
here
she
said
and
she
took
hold
of
the
bowl
for
herself
and
then
her
hands
became
fast
to
it
and
her
feet
to
the
slab
and
she
could
not
speak
a
word
then
came
thunder
and
a
fall
of
mist
thereupon
the
castle
of
the
active
door
vanished
and
never
was
seen
again
rhiannon
and
pryderi
also
vanished
when
kigva
the
wife
of
pryderi
saw
this
she
sorrowed
so
that
she
cared
not
if
she
lived
or
died
no
one
was
left
on
the
island
but
manawydan
and
herself
they
wandered
away
to
other
lands
and
sought
to
earn
their
living
then
they
came
back
to
their
island
bringing
with
them
one
bag
of
wheat
which
they
planted
it
throve
and
grew
and
when
the
time
of
harvest
came
it
was
most
promising
so
that
manawydan
resolved
to
reap
it
on
the
morrow
at
break
of
day
he
came
back
to
begin
but
found
nothing
left
but
straw
every
stalk
had
been
cut
close
to
the
ground
and
carried
away
going
to
another
field
he
found
it
ripe
but
on
coming
in
the
morning
he
found
but
the
straw
some
one
has
contrived
my
ruin
he
said
i
will
watch
the
third
field
to
see
what
happens
he
who
stole
the
first
will
come
to
steal
this
he
remained
through
the
evening
to
watch
the
grain
and
at
midnight
he
heard
loud
thunder
he
looked
and
saw
coming
a
host
of
mice
such
as
no
man
could
number
each
mouse
took
a
stalk
of
the
wheat
and
climbed
it
so
that
it
bent
to
the
ground
then
each
mouse
cut
off
the
ear
and
ran
away
with
it
they
all
did
this
leaving
the
stalk
bare
and
there
was
not
a
single
straw
for
which
there
was
not
a
mouse
he
struck
among
them
but
could
no
more
fix
his
sight
on
any
of
them
the
legend
says
than
on
flies
and
birds
in
the
air
except
one
which
seemed
heavier
than
the
rest
and
moved
slowly
this
one
he
pursued
and
caught
put
it
in
his
glove
and
tied
it
with
a
string
taking
it
home
he
showed
it
to
kigva
and
told
her
that
he
was
going
to
hang
the
mouse
next
day
she
advised
against
it
but
he
persisted
and
on
the
next
morning
took
the
animal
to
the
top
of
the
mound
of
arberth
where
he
placed
two
wooden
forks
in
the
ground
and
set
up
a
small
gallows
while
doing
this
he
saw
a
clerk
coming
to
him
in
old
threadbare
clothes
it
was
now
seven
years
since
he
had
seen
a
human
being
there
except
the
friends
he
had
lost
and
kigva
who
survived
them
the
clerk
bade
him
good
day
and
said
he
was
going
back
to
his
country
from
england
where
he
had
been
singing
then
the
clerk
asked
manawydan
what
he
was
doing
hanging
a
thief
said
he
and
when
the
clerk
saw
that
it
was
a
mouse
he
offered
a
pound
to
release
it
but
manawydan
refused
then
a
priest
came
riding
up
and
offered
him
three
pounds
to
release
the
mouse
but
this
offer
was
declined
then
he
made
a
noose
round
the
mouse
neck
and
while
he
did
this
a
bishop
whole
retinue
came
riding
towards
him
the
bishop
seemed
like
everybody
else
to
be
very
desirous
of
rescuing
the
mouse
he
offered
first
seven
pounds
and
then
and
then
added
all
his
horses
and
equipages
but
manawydan
still
refused
the
bishop
finally
asked
him
to
name
any
price
he
pleased
the
liberation
of
rhiannon
and
pryderi
he
said
thou
shalt
have
it
said
the
bishop
and
the
removal
of
the
enchantment
said
manawydan
that
also
said
the
bishop
if
you
will
only
restore
the
mouse
why
said
the
other
because
said
the
bishop
she
is
my
wife
why
did
she
come
to
me
asked
manawydan
to
steal
was
the
reply
when
it
was
known
that
you
were
inhabiting
the
island
my
household
came
to
me
begging
me
to
transform
them
into
mice
the
first
and
second
nights
they
came
alone
but
the
third
night
my
wife
and
the
ladies
of
the
court
wished
also
to
accompany
them
and
i
transformed
them
also
and
now
you
have
promised
to
let
her
go
not
so
said
the
other
except
with
a
promise
that
there
shall
be
no
more
such
enchantment
practised
and
no
vengeance
on
pryderi
and
rhiannon
or
on
me
this
being
promised
the
bishop
said
now
wilt
thou
release
my
wife
no
by
my
faith
said
manawydan
not
till
i
see
pryderi
and
rhiannon
free
before
my
eyes
here
they
are
coming
said
the
bishop
and
when
they
had
been
embraced
by
manawydan
he
let
go
the
mouse
the
bishop
touched
it
with
a
wand
and
it
became
the
most
beautiful
young
woman
that
ever
was
seen
now
look
round
upon
the
country
said
the
bishop
and
see
the
dwellings
and
the
crops
returned
and
the
enchantment
was
removed
the
land
of
illusion
and
the
realm
of
glamour
is
the
name
given
by
the
old
romancers
to
the
part
of
wales
and
to
all
the
islands
off
the
coast
indeed
it
was
believed
ever
since
the
days
of
the
greek
writer
plutarch
that
some
peculiar
magic
belonged
to
these
islands
and
every
great
storm
that
happened
among
them
was
supposed
to
be
caused
by
the
death
of
one
of
the
wondrous
enchanters
who
dwelt
in
that
region
when
it
was
over
the
islanders
said
some
one
of
the
mighty
has
passed
away
vii
merlin
the
enchanter
in
one
of
the
old
books
called
welsh
triads
in
which
all
things
are
classed
by
threes
there
is
a
description
of
three
men
called
the
three
generous
heroes
of
the
isle
of
britain
one
of
these
named
nud
or
nodens
and
later
called
merlin
was
first
brought
from
the
sea
it
is
stated
with
a
herd
of
cattle
consisting
of
milch
cows
which
are
supposed
to
mean
those
waves
of
the
sea
that
the
poets
often
describe
as
white
horses
he
grew
up
to
be
a
king
and
warrior
a
magician
and
prophet
and
on
the
whole
the
most
important
figure
in
the
celtic
traditions
he
came
from
the
sea
and
at
last
returned
to
it
but
meanwhile
he
did
great
works
on
land
one
of
which
is
said
to
have
been
the
building
of
stonehenge
this
is
the
way
as
the
old
legends
tell
in
which
the
vast
stones
of
stonehenge
came
to
be
placed
on
salisbury
plain
it
is
a
thing
which
has
always
been
a
puzzle
to
every
one
inasmuch
as
their
size
and
weight
are
enormous
and
there
is
no
stone
of
the
same
description
to
be
found
within
hundreds
of
miles
of
salisbury
plain
where
they
now
stand
the
legend
is
that
pendragon
king
of
england
was
led
to
fight
a
great
battle
by
seeing
a
dragon
in
the
air
the
battle
was
won
but
pendragon
was
killed
and
was
buried
on
salisbury
plain
where
the
fight
had
taken
place
when
his
brother
uther
took
his
place
merlin
the
enchanter
advised
him
to
paint
a
dragon
on
a
flag
and
bear
it
always
before
him
to
bring
good
fortune
and
this
he
always
did
then
merlin
said
to
him
wilt
thou
do
nothing
more
on
the
plain
of
salisbury
to
honor
thy
brother
the
king
said
what
shall
be
done
then
merlin
said
i
will
cause
a
thing
to
be
done
that
will
endure
to
the
world
end
then
he
bade
utherpendragon
as
he
called
the
new
king
to
send
many
ships
and
men
to
ireland
and
he
showed
him
stones
such
as
seemed
far
too
large
and
heavy
to
bring
but
he
placed
them
by
his
magic
art
upon
the
boats
and
bore
them
to
england
and
he
devised
means
to
transport
them
and
to
set
them
on
end
for
they
shall
seem
fairer
so
than
if
they
were
lying
and
there
they
are
to
this
day
this
was
the
way
in
which
merlin
would
sometimes
obtain
the
favor
and
admiration
of
young
ladies
there
was
a
maiden
of
twelve
named
nimiane
or
vivian
the
daughter
of
king
dionas
and
merlin
changed
himself
into
the
appearance
of
a
fair
young
squire
that
he
might
talk
with
her
beside
a
fountain
described
in
the
legends
as
a
well
whereof
the
springs
were
fair
and
the
water
clear
and
the
gravel
so
fair
that
it
seemed
of
fine
silver
by
degrees
he
made
acquaintance
with
the
child
who
told
him
who
she
was
adding
and
what
are
you
fair
sweet
friend
damsel
said
merlin
i
am
a
travelling
squire
seeking
for
my
master
who
has
taught
me
wonderful
things
and
what
master
is
that
she
asked
it
is
one
he
said
who
has
taught
me
so
much
that
i
could
here
erect
for
you
a
castle
and
i
could
make
many
people
outside
to
attack
it
and
inside
to
defend
it
nay
i
could
go
upon
this
water
and
not
wet
my
feet
and
i
could
make
a
river
where
water
had
never
been
these
are
strange
feats
said
the
maiden
and
i
wish
that
i
could
thus
disport
myself
i
can
do
yet
greater
things
said
merlin
and
no
one
can
devise
anything
which
i
can
not
do
and
i
can
also
make
it
to
endure
forever
indeed
said
the
girl
i
would
always
love
you
if
you
could
show
me
some
such
wonders
for
your
love
he
answered
i
will
show
you
some
of
these
wondrous
plays
and
i
will
ask
no
more
of
you
then
merlin
turned
and
described
a
circle
with
a
wand
and
then
came
and
sat
by
her
again
at
the
fountain
at
noon
she
saw
coming
out
of
the
forest
many
ladies
and
knights
and
squires
holding
each
other
by
the
hand
and
singing
in
the
greatest
joy
then
came
men
with
timbrels
and
tabours
and
dancing
so
that
one
could
not
tell
part
of
the
sports
that
went
on
then
merlin
caused
an
orchard
to
grow
with
all
manner
of
fruit
and
flowers
and
the
maiden
cared
for
nothing
but
to
listen
to
their
singing
truly
love
begins
in
joy
but
ends
in
grief
the
festival
continued
from
to
and
king
dionas
and
his
courtiers
came
out
to
see
it
and
marvelled
whence
these
strange
people
came
then
when
the
carols
were
ended
the
ladies
and
maidens
sat
down
on
the
green
grass
and
fresh
flowers
and
the
squires
set
up
a
game
of
tilting
called
quintain
upon
the
meadows
and
played
till
and
then
merlin
came
to
the
damsel
and
asked
if
he
had
done
what
he
promised
for
her
fair
sweet
friend
said
she
you
have
done
so
much
that
i
am
all
yours
let
me
teach
you
he
answered
and
i
will
show
you
many
wonders
that
no
woman
ever
learned
so
many
merlin
and
this
young
damsel
always
remained
friends
and
he
taught
her
many
wonderful
arts
one
of
which
was
this
we
must
regret
a
spell
by
which
she
might
put
her
parents
to
sleep
whenever
he
visited
her
while
another
lesson
was
this
being
more
unexceptionable
in
the
use
of
three
words
by
saying
which
she
might
at
any
time
keep
at
a
distance
any
men
who
tried
to
molest
her
he
stayed
eight
days
near
her
and
in
those
days
taught
her
many
of
the
most
wonderful
things
that
any
mortal
heart
could
think
of
things
past
and
things
that
were
done
and
said
and
a
part
of
what
was
to
come
and
she
put
them
in
writing
and
then
merlin
departed
from
her
and
came
to
benoyk
where
the
king
arthur
rested
so
that
glad
were
they
when
they
saw
merlin
the
relations
between
merlin
and
arthur
are
unlike
those
ever
held
towards
a
king
even
by
an
enchanter
in
any
legend
even
in
homer
there
is
no
one
described
except
the
gods
as
having
such
authority
over
a
ruler
merlin
came
and
went
as
he
pleased
and
under
any
form
he
might
please
he
foretold
the
result
of
a
battle
ordered
up
troops
brought
aid
from
a
distance
he
rebuked
the
bravest
knights
for
cowardice
as
when
ban
bors
and
gawain
had
concealed
themselves
behind
some
bushes
during
a
fight
is
this
he
said
to
king
arthur
and
sir
bors
the
war
and
the
help
that
you
do
to
your
friends
who
have
put
themselves
in
adventure
of
death
in
many
a
need
and
ye
come
hither
to
hide
for
cowardice
then
the
legend
says
when
the
king
understood
the
words
of
merlin
he
bowed
his
head
for
shame
and
the
other
knights
acknowledged
their
fault
then
merlin
took
the
dragon
banner
which
he
had
given
them
and
said
that
he
would
bear
it
himself
for
the
banner
of
a
king
he
said
should
not
be
hid
in
battle
but
borne
in
the
foremost
front
then
merlin
rode
forth
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
now
shall
be
shown
who
is
a
knight
and
the
knights
seeing
merlin
exclaimed
that
he
was
a
full
noble
man
and
without
fail
says
the
legend
he
was
full
of
marvellous
powers
and
strength
of
body
and
great
and
long
stature
but
brown
he
was
and
lean
and
rough
of
hair
then
he
rode
in
among
the
enemy
on
a
great
black
horse
and
the
golden
dragon
which
he
had
made
and
had
attached
to
the
banner
gave
out
from
its
throat
such
a
flaming
fire
that
the
air
was
black
with
its
smoke
and
all
king
arthur
men
began
to
fight
again
more
stoutly
and
arthur
himself
held
the
bridle
reins
in
his
left
hand
and
so
wielded
his
sword
with
his
right
as
to
slay
two
hundred
men
there
was
no
end
to
merlin
disguises
sometimes
as
an
old
man
sometimes
as
a
boy
or
a
dwarf
then
as
a
woman
then
as
an
ignorant
clown
but
the
legends
always
give
him
some
object
to
accomplish
some
work
to
do
and
there
was
always
a
certain
dignity
about
him
even
when
helping
king
arthur
as
he
sometimes
did
to
do
wrong
things
his
fame
extended
over
all
britain
and
also
through
brittany
now
a
part
of
france
where
the
same
poetic
legends
extended
this
for
instance
is
a
very
old
breton
song
about
him
merlin
the
diviner
merlin
merlin
where
art
thou
going
so
early
in
the
day
with
thy
black
dog
oi
oi
oi
oi
oi
oi
oi
oi
oi
oi
oi
oi
oi
oi
oi
oi
i
have
come
here
to
search
the
way
to
find
the
red
egg
the
red
egg
of
the
marine
serpent
by
the
seaside
in
the
hollow
of
the
stone
i
am
going
to
seek
in
the
valley
the
green
and
the
golden
grass
and
the
top
branch
of
the
oak
in
the
wood
by
the
side
of
the
fountain
merlin
merlin
retrace
your
steps
leave
the
branch
on
the
oak
and
the
green
in
the
valley
as
well
as
the
golden
grass
and
leave
the
red
egg
of
the
marine
serpent
in
the
foam
by
the
hollow
of
the
stone
merlin
merlin
retrace
thy
steps
there
is
no
diviner
but
god
merlin
was
supposed
to
know
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
and
to
be
able
to
assume
the
form
of
any
animal
and
even
that
of
a
or
huge
standing
stone
before
history
began
he
ruled
in
britain
then
a
delightful
island
of
flowery
meadows
his
subjects
were
small
people
fairies
and
their
lives
were
a
continued
festival
of
singing
playing
and
enjoyment
the
sage
ruled
them
as
a
father
his
familiar
servant
being
a
tame
wolf
he
also
possessed
a
kingdom
beneath
the
waves
where
everything
was
beautiful
the
inhabitants
being
charming
little
beings
with
waves
of
long
fair
hair
falling
on
their
shoulders
in
curls
fruits
and
milk
composed
the
food
of
all
meat
and
fish
being
held
in
abhorrence
the
only
want
felt
was
of
the
full
light
of
the
sun
which
coming
to
them
through
the
water
was
but
faint
and
cast
no
shadow
here
was
the
famous
workshop
where
merlin
forged
the
enchanted
sword
so
celebrated
by
the
bards
and
where
the
stones
were
found
by
which
alone
the
sword
could
be
sharpened
three
british
heroes
were
fated
to
wield
this
blade
in
turn
lemenisk
the
leaper
meaning
leap
utherpendragon
and
his
son
king
arthur
by
orders
of
this
last
hero
when
mortally
wounded
it
was
flung
into
the
sea
where
it
will
remain
till
he
returns
to
restore
the
rule
of
his
country
to
the
faithful
british
race
the
bard
once
amused
and
puzzled
the
court
by
entering
the
hall
as
a
blind
boy
led
by
a
greyhound
playing
on
his
harp
and
demanding
as
recompense
to
be
allowed
to
carry
the
king
banner
in
an
approaching
battle
being
refused
on
account
of
his
blindness
he
vanished
and
the
king
of
brittany
mentioned
his
suspicions
that
this
was
one
of
elfin
tricks
arthur
was
disturbed
for
he
had
promised
to
give
the
child
anything
except
his
honor
his
kingdom
his
wife
and
his
sword
however
while
he
continued
to
fret
there
entered
the
hall
a
poor
child
about
eight
years
old
with
shaved
head
features
of
livid
tint
eyes
of
light
gray
barefooted
barelegged
and
a
whip
knotted
over
his
shoulders
in
the
manner
affected
by
horseboys
speaking
and
looking
like
an
idiot
he
asked
the
king
permission
to
bear
the
royal
ensign
in
the
approaching
battle
with
the
giant
rion
the
courtiers
laughed
but
arthur
suspecting
a
new
joke
on
merlin
part
granted
the
demand
and
then
merlin
stood
in
his
own
proper
person
before
the
company
he
also
seems
to
have
taught
people
many
things
in
real
science
especially
the
women
who
were
in
those
days
more
studious
than
the
men
or
at
least
had
less
leisure
for
instance
the
legend
says
of
morgan
le
fay
or
la
fée
king
arthur
sister
she
was
a
noble
clergesse
meaning
that
she
could
read
and
write
like
the
clergy
and
of
astronomy
could
she
enough
for
merlin
had
her
taught
and
she
learned
much
of
egromancy
magic
or
necromancy
and
the
best
she
was
with
her
hands
that
any
man
knew
in
any
land
and
she
had
the
fairest
head
and
the
fairest
hands
under
heaven
and
shoulders
and
she
had
fair
eloquence
and
full
debonair
she
was
as
long
as
she
was
in
her
right
wit
and
when
she
was
wroth
with
any
man
she
was
evil
to
meet
this
lady
was
one
of
merlin
pupils
but
the
one
whom
he
loved
most
and
instructed
the
most
was
nimiane
or
vivian
already
mentioned
who
seems
to
have
been
to
him
rather
a
beloved
younger
sister
than
anything
else
and
he
taught
her
so
much
that
at
last
he
might
hold
himself
a
fool
the
legend
says
and
ever
she
inquired
of
his
cunning
and
his
mysteries
each
thing
by
itself
and
he
let
her
know
all
and
she
wrote
all
that
he
said
as
she
was
well
learned
in
clergie
reading
and
writing
and
learned
lightly
all
that
merlin
taught
her
and
when
they
parted
each
of
them
commended
the
other
to
god
full
tenderly
the
form
of
the
enchanter
merlin
disappeared
from
view
at
last
for
the
legends
do
not
admit
that
his
life
ever
ended
across
the
sea
whence
he
came
the
poet
tennyson
to
be
sure
describes
nimiane
or
vivian
the
lady
of
the
lake
as
a
wicked
enchantress
who
persuaded
merlin
to
betray
his
secrets
to
her
and
then
shut
him
up
in
an
oak
tree
forever
but
other
legends
seem
to
show
that
tennyson
does
great
injustice
to
the
lady
of
the
lake
that
she
really
loved
merlin
even
in
his
age
and
therefore
persuaded
him
to
show
her
how
to
make
a
tower
without
walls
that
they
might
dwell
there
together
in
peace
and
address
each
other
only
as
brother
and
sister
when
he
had
told
her
he
fell
asleep
with
his
head
in
her
lap
and
she
wove
a
spell
nine
times
around
his
head
and
the
tower
became
the
strongest
in
the
world
some
of
the
many
legends
place
this
tower
in
the
forest
of
broceliande
while
others
transport
it
afar
to
a
magic
island
where
merlin
dwells
with
his
nine
bards
and
where
vivian
alone
can
come
or
go
through
the
magic
walls
some
legends
describe
it
as
an
enclosure
neither
of
iron
nor
steel
nor
timber
nor
of
stone
but
of
the
air
without
any
other
thing
but
enchantment
so
strong
that
it
may
never
be
undone
while
the
world
endureth
here
dwells
merlin
it
is
said
with
nine
favorite
bards
who
took
with
them
the
thirteen
treasures
of
england
these
treasures
are
said
to
have
been
a
sword
if
any
man
drew
it
except
the
owner
it
burst
into
a
flame
from
the
cross
to
the
point
all
who
asked
it
received
it
but
because
of
this
peculiarity
all
shunned
it
a
basket
if
food
for
one
man
were
put
into
it
when
opened
it
would
be
found
to
contain
food
for
one
hundred
a
horn
what
liquor
soever
was
desired
was
found
therein
a
chariot
whoever
sat
in
it
would
be
immediately
wheresoever
he
wished
a
halter
which
was
in
a
staple
below
the
feet
of
a
bed
and
whatever
horse
one
wished
for
in
it
he
would
find
it
there
a
knife
which
would
serve
twenty
men
at
meat
all
at
once
a
caldron
if
meat
were
put
into
it
to
boil
for
a
coward
it
would
never
be
boiled
but
if
meat
were
put
in
it
for
a
brave
man
it
would
be
boiled
forthwith
a
whetstone
if
the
sword
of
a
brave
man
were
sharpened
thereon
and
any
one
were
wounded
therewith
he
would
be
sure
to
die
but
if
it
were
that
of
a
coward
that
was
sharpened
on
it
he
would
be
none
the
worse
a
garment
if
a
man
of
gentle
birth
put
it
on
it
suited
him
well
but
if
a
churl
it
would
not
fit
him
a
pan
and
a
platter
whatever
food
was
required
was
found
therein
a
chessboard
when
the
men
were
placed
upon
it
they
would
play
of
themselves
the
chessboard
was
of
gold
and
the
men
of
silver
the
mantle
of
arthur
whosoever
was
beneath
it
could
see
everything
while
no
one
could
see
him
it
is
towards
this
tower
some
legends
say
that
merlin
was
last
seen
by
some
irish
monks
sailing
away
westward
with
a
maiden
in
a
boat
of
crystal

a

fair
sweet

said
the
queen

she
was
known
as

was
to
instruct
him
in
all
knightly

he
learned
to

to

some
cousins

also
brought
thither
by
the

to
be
his

when

was
eighteen

wished
to
go

that
he
might
be

on
the
eve
of

returned
from

and
by
the
high

met
a

the
iron
boots
next
came
two
squires
clad
in
white
robes
and
mounted
on
white
horses
carrying
a
silver
shield
and
a
shining
helmet
after
these
two
others
with
a
sword
in
a
white
sheath
and
a
white
charger
behind
followed
squires
and
servants
in
white
coats
three
damsels
dressed
in
white
the
two
sons
of
king
bors
and
last
of
all
the
fairy
with
the
youth
she
loved
her
robe
was
of
white
samite
lined
with
ermine
her
white
palfrey
had
a
silver
bit
while
her
breastplate
stirrups
and
saddle
were
of
ivory
carved
with
figures
of
ladies
and
knights
and
her
white
housings
trailed
on
the
ground
when
she
perceived
the
king
she
responded
to
his
salutation
and
said
after
she
had
lowered
her
wimple
and
displayed
her
face
sir
may
god
bless
the
best
of
kings
i
come
to
implore
a
boon
which
it
shall
cost
you
nothing
to
grant
damsel
even
it
should
cost
me
dear
you
should
not
be
refused
what
is
it
you
would
have
me
do
sir
dub
this
varlet
a
knight
and
array
him
in
the
arms
he
bringeth
whenever
he
desireth
your
mercy
damsel
to
bring
me
such
a
youth
assuredly
i
will
dub
him
whenever
he
will
but
it
shameth
me
to
abandon
my
custom
for
is
my
wont
to
furnish
with
garments
and
arms
such
as
come
thither
to
receive
chivalry
the
lady
replied
that
she
desired
the
youth
to
carry
the
arms
she
had
intended
him
to
wear
and
if
she
were
refused
she
would
address
herself
elsewhere
sir
ewain
said
that
so
fair
a
youth
ought
not
to
be
denied
and
the
king
yielded
to
her
entreaty
she
returned
thanks
and
bade
the
varlet
retain
the
mules
and
the
charger
with
the
two
squires
and
after
that
she
prepared
to
return
as
she
had
come
in
spite
of
the
urgency
of
the
king
who
had
begged
her
to
remain
in
his
court
at
least
he
cried
tell
us
by
what
name
are
you
known
sir
she
answered
i
am
called
the
lady
of
the
lake
for
a
long
way
lancelot
escorted
the
fairy
who
said
to
him
as
she
took
leave

most
noble

that

as
great
as
your
beauty
you
will
ask
the
king
to
bestow
on
you
knighthood
when
you
are
armed
you
will
not
tarry
in
his
house
a
single
night
abide
in
one
place
no
longer
than
you
can
help
and
refrain
from
declaring
your
name
until
others
proclaim
it
be
prepared
to
accomplish
every
adventure
and
never
let
another
man
complete
a
task
which
you
yourself
have
undertaken
with
that
she
gave
him
a
ring
that
had
the
property
of
dissolving
enchantment
and
commended
him
to
god
on
the
morrow
lancelot
arrayed
himself
in
his
fairest
robes
and
sued
for

each
took
sir
ewain
by
a
hand
and
seated
him
on
a
couch
while
the
varlet
stood
in
their
presence
on
the
rushes
that
strewed
the
floor
all
gazed
with
pleasure
and
the
queen
prayed
that
god
might
make
him
noble
for
he
possessed
as
much
beauty
as
was
possible
for
man
to
have
after
this
he
had
many
perilous
adventures
he
fought
with
giants
and
lions
he
entered
an
enchanted
castle
and
escaped
he
went
to
a
well
in
the
forest
and
striking
three
times
on
a
cymbal
with
a
hammer
hung
there
for
the
purpose
called
forth
a
great
giant
whom
he
slew
afterwards
marrying
his
daughter
then
he
went
to
rescue
the
queen
of
the
realm
gwenivere
from
captivity
in
order
to
reach
the
fortress
where
she
was
prisoner
he
had
to
ride
in
a
cart
with
a
dwarf
to
follow
a
wheel
that
rolled
before
him
to
show
him
the
way
or
a
ball
that
took
the
place
of
the
wheel
he
had
to
walk
on
his
hands
and
knees
across
a
bridge
made
of
a
drawn
sword
he
suffered
greatly
at
last
he
rescued
the
queen
and
later
than
this
he
married

daughter
of
king

and
her
father

to
them
the
castle
of
blyaunt
in
the
joyous
island
enclosed
in
iron
and
with
a
deep
water
all
around
it
there
lancelot
challenged
all
knights
to
come
and
contend
with
him
and
he
jousted
with
more
than
five
hundred
overcoming
them
all
yet
killing
none
and
at
last
he
returned
to
camelot
the
place
of
king
arthur
court
one
day
he
was
called
from
the
court
to
an
abbey
where
three
nuns
brought
to
him
a
beautiful
boy
of
fifteen
asking
that
he
might
be
made
a
knight
this
was
sir
lancelot
own
son
galahad
whom
he
had
never
seen
and
did
not
yet
know
that
evening
sir
lancelot
remained
at
the
abbey
with
the
boy
that
he
might
keep
his
vigil
there
and
on
the
morrow
dawn
he
was
made
a
knight
sir
lancelot
put
on
one
of
his
spurs
and
bors
lancelot
cousin
the
other
and
then
sir
lancelot
said
to
the
boy
fair
son
attend
me
to
the
court
of
the
king
but
the
abbess
said
sir
not
now
but
we
will
send
him
when
it
shall
be
time
on
whitsunday
at
the
time
called
underne
which
was
nine
in
the
morning
king
arthur
and
his
knights
sat
at
the
round
table
where
on
every
seat
there
was
written
in
letters
of
gold
the
name
of
a
knight
with
here
ought
to
sit
he
or
he
ought
to
sit
here
and
thus
went
the
inscriptions
until
they
came
to
one
seat
or
in
french
called
the
siege
perilous
where
they
found
newly
written
letters
of
gold
saying
that
this
seat
could
not
be
occupied
until
four
hundred
and
fifty
years
after
the
death
of
christ
and
that
was
this
very
day
then
there
came
news
of
a
marvellous
stone
which
had
been
seen
above
the
water
with
a
sword
sticking
in
it
bearing
the
letters
never
shall
man
take
me
hence
but
only
he
by
whose
side
i
ought
to
hang
and
he
shall
be
the
best
knight
of
the
world
then
two
of
the
knights
tried
to
draw
the
sword
and
failed
to
draw
it
and
sir
lancelot
who
was
thought
the
best
knight
in
all
the
world
refused
to
attempt
it
then
they
went
back
to
their
seats
around
the
table
then
when
all
the
seats
but
the
siege
perilous
were
full
the
hall
was
suddenly
darkened
and
an
old
man
clad
in
white
whom
nobody
knew
came
in
with
a
young
knight
in
red
armor
wearing
an
empty
scabbard
at
his
side
who
said
peace
be
with
you
fair
knights
the
old
man
said
i
bring
you
here
a
young
knight
that
is
of
kings
lineage
and
the
king
said
sir
ye
are
right
heartily
welcome
then
the
old
man
bade
the
young
knight
to
remove
his
armor
and
he
wore
a
red
garment
while
the
old
man
placed
on
his
shoulders
a
mantle
of
fine
ermine
and
said
sir
follow
after
then
the
old
man
led
him
to
the
siege
perilous
next
to
sir
lancelot
and
lifted
the
cloth
and
read
here
sits
sir
galahad
and
the
youth
sat
down
upon
this
all
the
knights
of
the
round
table
marvelled
greatly
at
sir
galahad
that
he
dared
to
sit
in
that
seat
and
he
so
tender
of
age
then
king
arthur
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
down
to
the
river
to
see
the
adventure
of
the
stone
sir
said
the
king
to
sir
galahad
here
is
a
great
marvel
where
right
good
knights
have
tried
and
failed
sir
said
sir
galahad
that
is
no
marvel
for
the
adventure
was
not
theirs
but
mine
i
have
brought
no
sword
with
me
for
here
by
my
side
hangs
the
scabbard
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
sword
and
lightly
drew
it
from
the
stone
it
was
not
until
long
after
and
when
they
both
had
had
many
adventures
that
sir
lancelot
discovered
galahad
to
be
his
son
sir
lancelot
once
came
to
the
and
found
a
ship
without
sails
or
oars
and
sailed
away
upon
it
once
when
he
touched
at
an
island
a
young
knight
came
on
board
to
whom
lancelot
said
sir
you
are
welcome
and
when
the
young
knight
asked
his
name
told
him
my
name
is
sir
lancelot
du
lac
sir
he
said
then
you
are
welcome
for
you
are
my
father
ah
said
lancelot
are
you
sir
galahad
then
the
young
knight
kneeled
down
and
asked
his
blessing
and
they
embraced
each
other
and
there
was
great
joy
between
them
and
they
told
each
other
all
their
deeds
so
dwelt
sir
lancelot
and
sir
galahad
together
within
that
ship
for
half
a
year
and
often
they
arrived
at
islands
far
from
men
where
there
were
but
wild
beasts
and
they
found
many
adventures
strange
and
perilous
which
they
brought
to
an
end
when
sir
lancelot
at
last
died
his
body
was
taken
to
his
home
and
there
it
lay
in
state
in
the
choir
with
a
hundred
torches
blazing
above
it
and
while
it
was
there
came
his
brother
sir
ector
de
maris
who
had
long
been
seeking
lancelot
when
he
heard
such
noise
and
saw
such
lights
in
the
choir
he
alighted
and
came
in
and
sir
bors
went
towards
him
and
told
him
that
his
brother
lancelot
was
lying
dead
then
sir
ector
threw
his
shield
and
sword
and
helm
from
him
and
when
he
looked
on
sir
lancelot
face
he
fell
down
in
a
swoon
and
when
he
rose
he
spoke
thus
ah
sir
lancelot
said
he
thou
wert
dead
of
all
christen
knights
and
now
i
dare
say
that
sir
lancelot
there
thou
liest
thou
wert
never
matched
of
none
earthly
knight
hands
and
thou
wert
the
curtiest
knight
that
ever
beare
shield
and
thou
wert
the
truest
friend
to
thy
lover
that
ever
bestrood
horse
and
thou
wert
the
truest
lover
of
a
sinful
man
that
ever
loved
woman
and
thou
wert
the
kindest
man
that
ever
strooke
with
sword
and
thou
wert
the
goodliest
person
that
ever
came
among
presse
of
knights
and
thou
wert
the
meekest
man
and
the
gentlest
that
ever
eate
in
hall
among
ladies
and
thou
wert
the
sternest
knight
to
thy
mortall
foe
that
ever
put
speare
in
the
rest
ix
the
king
arthur
in
his
youth
was
fond
of
all
manly
exercises
especially
of
wrestling
an
art
in
which
he
found
few
equals
the
old
men
who
had
been
the
champions
of
earlier
days
and
who
still
sat
in
summer
evenings
watching
the
youths
who
tried
their
skill
before
them
at
last
told
him
that
he
had
no
rival
in
cornwall
and
that
his
only
remaining
competitor
elsewhere
was
one
who
had
tired
out
all
others
where
is
he
said
arthur
he
dwells
an
old
man
said
on
an
island
whither
you
will
have
to
go
and
find
him
he
is
of
all
wrestlers
the
most
formidable
you
will
think
him
at
first
so
insignificant
as
to
be
hardly
worth
a
contest
you
will
easily
throw
him
at
the
first
trial
but
after
a
while
you
will
find
him
growing
stronger
he
seeks
out
all
your
weak
points
as
by
magic
he
never
gives
up
you
may
throw
him
again
and
again
but
he
will
conquer
you
at
last
his
name
his
name
said
arthur
his
name
they
answered
is
hanner
dyn
his
home
is
everywhere
but
on
his
own
island
you
will
be
likely
to
find
him
sooner
or
later
keep
clear
of
him
or
he
will
get
the
best
of
you
in
the
end
and
make
you
his
slave
as
he
makes
slaves
of
others
whom
he
has
conquered
far
and
wide
over
the
ocean
the
young
arthur
sought
he
touched
at
island
after
island
he
saw
many
weak
men
who
did
not
dare
to
wrestle
with
him
and
many
strong
ones
whom
he
could
always
throw
until
at
last
when
he
was
far
out
under
the
western
sky
he
came
one
day
to
an
island
which
he
had
never
before
seen
and
which
seemed
uninhabited
presently
there
came
out
from
beneath
an
arbor
of
flowers
a
little
miniature
man
graceful
and
as
an
elf
arthur
eager
in
his
quest
said
to
him
in
what
island
dwells
hanner
dyn
in
this
island
was
the
answer
where
is
he
said
arthur
i
am
he
said
the
laughing
boy
taking
hold
of
his
hand
what
did
they
mean
by
calling
you
a
wrestler
said
arthur
oh
said
the
child
coaxingly
i
am
a
wrestler
try
me
the
king
took
him
and
tossed
him
in
the
air
with
his
strong
arms
till
the
boy
shouted
with
delight
he
then
took
arthur
by
the
hand
and
led
him
about
the
island
showed
him
his
house
and
where
the
gardens
and
fields
were
he
showed
him
the
rows
of
men
toiling
in
the
meadows
or
felling
trees
they
all
work
for
me
he
said
carelessly
the
king
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
more
stalwart
set
of
laborers
then
the
boy
led
him
to
the
house
asked
him
what
his
favorite
fruits
were
or
his
favorite
beverages
and
seemed
to
have
all
at
hand
he
was
an
unaccountable
little
creature
in
size
and
years
he
seemed
a
child
but
in
his
activity
and
agility
he
seemed
almost
a
man
when
the
king
told
him
so
he
smiled
as
winningly
as
ever
and
said
that
is
what
they
call
me
hanner
dyn
the
laughing
merrily
he
helped
arthur
into
his
boat
and
bade
him
farewell
urging
him
to
come
again
the
king
sailed
away
looking
back
with
something
like
affection
on
his
winsome
little
playmate
it
was
months
before
arthur
came
that
way
again
again
the
merry
child
met
him
having
grown
a
good
deal
since
their
earlier
meeting
how
is
my
little
wrestler
said
arthur
try
me
said
the
boy
and
the
king
tossed
him
again
in
his
arms
finding
the
delicate
limbs
firmer
and
the
slender
body
heavier
than
before
though
easily
manageable
the
island
was
as
green
and
more
cultivated
there
were
more
men
working
in
the
fields
and
arthur
noticed
that
their
look
was
not
cheerful
but
rather
as
of
those
who
had
been
discouraged
and
oppressed
it
was
however
a
charming
sail
to
the
island
and
as
it
became
more
familiar
the
king
often
bade
his
steersman
guide
the
pinnace
that
way
he
was
often
startled
with
the
rapid
growth
and
increased
strength
of
the
laughing
boy
hanner
dyn
while
at
other
times
he
seemed
much
as
before
and
appeared
to
have
made
but
little
progress
the
youth
seemed
never
tired
of
wrestling
he
always
begged
the
king
for
a
trial
of
skill
and
the
king
rejoiced
to
see
how
readily
the
young
wrestler
caught
at
the
tricks
of
the
art
so
that
the
time
had
long
passed
when
even
strength
could
toss
him
lightly
in
the
air
as
at
first
hanner
dyn
was
growing
with
incredible
rapidity
into
a
tall
young
fellow
and
instead
of
the
weakness
that
often
comes
with
rapid
growth
his
muscles
grew
ever
harder
and
harder
still
merry
and
smiling
he
began
to
wrestle
in
earnest
and
one
day
in
a
moment
of
carelessness
arthur
received
a
back
fall
perhaps
on
moist
ground
and
measured
his
length
rising
with
a
quick
motion
he
laughed
at
the
angry
faces
of
his
attendants
and
bade
the
boy
farewell
the
men
at
work
in
the
fields
glanced
up
attracted
by
the
sound
of
voices
and
he
saw
them
exchange
looks
with
one
another
yet
he
felt
his
kingly
dignity
a
little
impaired
and
hastened
ere
long
to
revisit
the
island
and
teach
the
saucy
boy
another
lesson
months
had
passed
and
the
youth
had
expanded
into
a
man
of
princely
promise
but
with
the
same
sunny
look
his
shoulders
were
now
broad
his
limbs
of
the
firmest
mould
his
eye
clear
keen
penetrating
of
all
the
wrestlers
i
have
ever
yet
met
said
the
king
this
younker
promises
to
be
the
most
formidable
i
can
easily
throw
him
now
but
what
will
he
be
a
few
years
hence
the
youth
greeted
him
joyously
and
they
began
their
usual
match
the
sullen
serfs
in
the
fields
stopped
to
watch
them
and
an
aged
druid
priest
whom
arthur
had
brought
with
him
to
give
the
old
man
air
and
exercise
in
the
boat
opened
his
weak
eyes
and
closed
them
again
as
they
began
to
wrestle
the
king
felt
by
the
very
grasp
of
the
arms
by
the
firm
set
of
his
foot
upon
the
turf
that
this
was
to
be
unlike
any
previous
effort
the
wrestlers
stood
after
the
old
cornish
fashion
breast
to
breast
each
resting
his
chin
on
the
other
shoulder
they
grasped
each
other
round
the
body
each
setting
his
left
hand
above
the
other
right
each
tried
to
force
the
other
to
touch
the
ground
with
both
shoulders
and
one
hip
or
with
both
hips
and
one
shoulder
or
else
to
compel
the
other
to
relinquish
his
hold
for
an
instant
either
of
these
successes
giving
the
victory
often
as
arthur
had
tried
the
art
he
never
had
been
so
matched
before
the
competitors
swayed
this
way
and
that
writhed
struggled
half
lost
their
footing
and
regained
it
yet
neither
yielded
all
the
boatmen
gathered
breathlessly
around
king
arthur
men
refusing
to
believe
their
eyes
even
when
they
knew
their
king
was
in
danger
a
stranger
group
was
that
of
the
sullen
who
left
their
ploughs
and
spades
and
congregating
on
a
rising
ground
watched
without
any
expression
of
sympathy
the
contest
that
was
going
on
an
old
wrestler
from
cornwall
whom
arthur
had
brought
with
him
was
the
judge
and
according
to
the
habit
of
the
time
the
contest
was
for
the
best
two
bouts
in
three
by
the
utmost
skill
and
strength
arthur
compelled
hanner
dyn
to
lose
his
hold
for
one
instant
in
the
first
trial
and
the
king
was
pronounced
the
victor
the
second
test
was
far
more
difficult
the
boy
now
grown
to
a
man
and
seeming
to
grow
older
and
stronger
before
their
very
eyes
twice
forced
arthur
to
the
ground
either
with
hip
or
shoulder
but
never
with
both
while
the
crowd
closed
in
breathlessly
around
and
the
old
druid
who
had
himself
been
a
wrestler
in
his
youth
and
who
had
been
brought
ashore
to
witness
the
contest
called
warningly
aloud
save
thyself
o
king
at
this
arthur
roused
his
failing
strength
to
one
final
effort
and
griping
his
rival
round
the
waist
with
a
mighty
grasp
raised
him
bodily
from
the
ground
and
threw
him
backward
till
he
fell
flat
like
a
log
on
both
shoulders
and
both
hips
while
arthur
himself
fell
fainting
a
moment
later
nor
did
he
recover
until
he
found
himself
in
the
boat
his
head
resting
on
the
knees
of
the
aged
druid
who
said
to
him
never
again
o
king
must
you
encounter
the
danger
you
have
barely
escaped
had
you
failed
you
would
have
become
subject
to
your
opponent
whose
strength
has
been
maturing
for
years
to
overpower
you
had
you
yielded
you
would
although
a
king
have
become
but
as
are
those
men
who
till
his
fields
and
do
his
bidding
for
know
you
not
what
the
name
hanner
dyn
means
it
means
habit
and
the
force
of
habit
at
first
weak
then
growing
constantly
stronger
ends
in
conquering
even
kings
x
king
arthur
at
avalon
in
the
ruined
castle
at
winchester
england
built
by
william
the
conqueror
there
is
a
hall
called
the
great
hall
where
richard
coeur
de
lion
was
received
by
his
nobles
when
rescued
from
captivity
where
henry
iii
was
born
where
all
the
edwards
held
court
where
henry
viii
entertained
the
emperor
charles
where
queen
mary
was
married
to
philip
ii
where
parliament
met
for
many
years
it
is
now
a
public
hall
for
the
county
and
at
one
end
of
it
the
visitor
sees
against
the
wall
a
vast
wooden
tablet
on
which
the
names
of
king
arthur
knights
of
the
round
table
are
inscribed
in
a
circle
no
one
knows
its
date
or
origin
though
it
is
known
to
be
more
than
four
hundred
years
old
but
there
appear
upon
it
the
names
most
familiar
to
those
who
have
read
the
legends
of
king
arthur
whether
in
tennyson
poems
or
elsewhere
there
are
lancelot
and
bedivere
gawaine
and
dagonet
modred
and
gareth
and
the
rest
many
books
have
been
written
of
their
deeds
but
a
time
came
when
almost
all
those
knights
were
to
fall
according
to
the
legend
in
one
great
battle
modred
the
king
nephew
had
been
left
in
charge
of
the
kingdom
during
arthur
absence
and
had
betrayed
him
and
tried
to
dethrone
him
meaning
to
crown
himself
king
many
people
joined
with
him
saying
that
under
arthur
they
had
had
only
war
and
fighting
but
under
modred
they
would
have
peace
and
bliss
yet
nothing
was
farther
from
modred
purpose
than
bliss
or
peace
and
it
was
agreed
at
last
that
a
great
battle
should
be
fought
for
the
kingdom
on
the
night
of
trinity
sunday
king
arthur
had
a
dream
he
thought
he
sat
in
a
chair
upon
a
scaffold
and
the
chair
was
fastened
to
a
wheel
he
was
dressed
in
the
richest
cloth
of
gold
that
could
be
made
but
far
beneath
him
he
saw
a
pit
full
of
black
water
in
which
were
all
manner
of
serpents
and
floating
beasts
then
the
wheel
began
to
turn
and
he
went
down
down
among
the
floating
things
and
they
wreathed
themselves
about
him
till
he
cried
help
help
then
his
knights
and
squires
and
yeomen
aroused
him
but
he
slumbered
again
not
sleeping
nor
thoroughly
waking
then
he
thought
he
saw
his
nephew
sir
gawaine
with
a
number
of
fair
ladies
and
when
king
arthur
saw
him
he
said
o
fair
nephew
what
are
these
ladies
who
come
with
you
sir
said
sir
gawaine
these
are
the
ladies
for
whose
protection
i
fought
while
i
was
a
living
man
and
god
has
given
them
grace
that
they
should
bring
me
thither
to
you
to
warn
you
of
your
death
if
you
fight
with
sir
modred
you
must
be
slain
and
most
of
your
people
on
both
sides
so
sir
gawaine
and
all
the
ladies
vanished
and
then
the
king
called
upon
his
knights
and
squires
and
yeomen
and
summoned
his
lords
and
bishops
they
agreed
to
propose
to
sir
modred
that
they
should
have
a
month
delay
and
meanwhile
agreed
to
meet
him
with
fourteen
persons
on
each
side
besides
arthur
and
modred
each
of
these
leaders
warned
his
army
when
they
met
to
watch
the
other
and
not
to
draw
their
swords
until
they
saw
a
drawn
sword
on
the
other
side
in
that
case
they
were
to
come
on
fiercely
so
the
small
party
of
chosen
men
on
each
side
met
and
drank
wine
together
and
agreed
upon
a
month
delay
before
fighting
but
while
this
was
going
on
an
adder
came
out
of
a
bush
and
stung
a
knight
on
the
foot
and
he
drew
his
sword
to
slay
it
and
thought
of
nothing
farther
at
the
sight
of
that
sword
the
two
armies
were
in
motion
trumpets
were
blown
instantly
and
the
men
of
each
army
thought
that
the
other
army
had
begun
the
fray
alas
this
unhappy
day
cried
king
arthur
and
as
the
old
chronicle
says
nothing
there
was
but
rushing
and
riding
fencing
and
striking
and
many
a
grim
word
was
there
spoken
either
to
other
and
many
a
deadly
stroke
the
following
is
the
oldest
account
of
the
battle
translated
into
quaint
and
literal
english
by
madden
from
the
book
called
layamon
brut
innumerable
folk
it
came
toward
the
host
riding
and
on
foot
as
the
rain
down
falleth
arthur
marched
to
cornwall
with
an
immense
army
modred
heard
that
and
advanced
against
him
with
innumerable
folk
there
were
many
fated
upon
the
tambre
they
came
together
the
place
hight
camelford
evermore
lasted
the
same
word
and
at
camelford
was
assembled
sixty
thousand
and
more
thousands
thereto
modred
was
their
chief
then
thitherward
ride
arthur
the
mighty
with
innumerable
folk
fated
though
it
were
upon
the
tambre
they
encountered
together
elevated
their
standards
advanced
together
drew
their
long
swords
smote
on
the
helms
fire
outsprang
spears
splintered
shields
shiver
shafts
brake
in
pieces
there
fought
all
together
innumerable
folk
tambre
was
in
flood
with
blood
to
excess
there
might
no
man
in
the
fight
know
any
warrior
nor
who
did
worse
nor
who
better
so
was
the
conflict
mingled
for
each
slew
downright
were
he
swain
were
he
knight
there
was
modred
slain
and
deprived
of
and
all
his
knights
slain
in
the
fight
there
were
slain
all
the
brave
arthur
warriors
high
and
low
and
all
the
britons
of
arthur
board
and
all
his
dependents
of
many
kingdoms
and
arthur
wounded
with
broad
fifteen
dreadful
wounds
he
had
in
the
least
one
might
thrust
two
gloves
then
was
there
no
more
remained
in
the
fight
of
two
hundred
thousand
men
that
there
lay
hewed
in
pieces
except
arthur
the
king
alone
and
two
of
his
knights
arthur
was
wounded
wondrously
much
there
came
to
him
a
lad
who
was
of
his
kindred
he
was
cador
son
the
earl
of
cornwall
constantine
the
lad
hight
he
was
dear
to
the
king
arthur
looked
on
him
where
he
lay
on
the
ground
and
said
these
words
with
sorrowful
heart
thou
art
welcome
thou
wert
son
i
give
thee
here
my
kingdom
and
defend
thou
my
britons
ever
in
thy
life
and
maintain
them
all
the
laws
that
have
stood
in
my
days
and
all
the
good
laws
that
in
uther
days
stood
and
i
will
fare
to
avalon
to
the
fairest
of
all
maidens
to
argante
the
queen
an
elf
most
fair
and
she
shall
make
my
wounds
all
sound
make
me
all
whole
with
healing
draughts
and
afterwards
i
will
come
to
my
kingdom
and
dwell
with
the
britons
with
mickle
joy
even
with
the
words
there
approached
from
the
sea
that
was
a
short
boat
floating
with
the
waves
and
two
women
therein
wondrously
formed
and
they
took
arthur
anon
and
bare
him
quickly
and
laid
him
softly
down
and
forth
they
depart
then
was
it
accomplished
that
merlin
whilom
said
that
mickle
care
should
be
of
arthur
departure
the
britons
believe
yet
that
he
is
alive
and
dwelleth
in
avalon
with
the
fairest
of
all
elves
and
the
britons
ever
yet
expect
when
arthur
shall
return
was
never
the
man
born
of
any
lady
chosen
that
knoweth
of
the
sooth
to
say
more
of
arthur
but
whilom
was
a
sage
hight
merlin
he
said
with
words
his
sayings
were
sooth
that
an
arthur
should
yet
come
to
help
the
english
another
traditional
account
which
tennyson
has
mainly
followed
in
a
poem
is
this
the
king
bade
sir
bedivere
take
his
good
sword
excalibur
and
go
with
it
to
the
and
throw
it
into
the
water
and
return
to
tell
what
he
saw
then
sir
bedivere
took
the
sword
and
it
was
so
richly
and
preciously
adorned
that
he
would
not
throw
it
and
came
back
without
it
when
the
king
asked
what
had
happened
sir
bedivere
said
i
saw
nothing
but
waves
and
wind
and
when
arthur
did
not
believe
him
and
sent
him
again
he
made
the
same
answer
and
then
when
sent
a
third
time
he
threw
the
sword
into
the
water
as
far
as
he
could
then
an
arm
and
a
hand
rose
above
the
water
and
caught
it
and
shook
and
brandished
it
three
times
and
vanished
then
sir
bedivere
came
back
to
the
king
he
told
what
he
had
seen
alas
said
arthur
help
me
from
hence
for
i
fear
i
have
tarried
over
long
then
sir
bedivere
took
king
arthur
upon
his
back
and
went
with
him
to
the
water
side
and
when
they
had
reached
there
a
barge
with
many
fair
ladies
was
lying
there
with
many
ladies
in
it
and
among
them
three
queens
and
they
all
had
black
hoods
and
they
wept
and
shrieked
when
they
saw
king
arthur
now
put
me
in
the
barge
said
arthur
and
the
three
queens
received
him
with
great
tenderness
and
king
arthur
laid
his
head
in
the
lap
of
one
and
she
said
ah
dear
brother
why
have
ye
tarried
so
long
until
your
wound
was
cold
and
then
they
rowed
away
and
king
arthur
said
to
sir
bedivere
i
will
go
unto
the
valley
of
avalon
to
heal
my
grievous
wound
and
if
i
never
return
pray
for
my
soul
he
was
rowed
away
by
the
weeping
queens
and
one
of
them
was
arthur
sister
morgan
le
fay
another
was
the
queen
of
northgalis
and
the
third
was
the
queen
of
waste
lands
and
it
was
the
belief
for
years
in
many
parts
of
england
that
arthur
was
not
dead
but
would
come
again
to
reign
in
england
when
he
had
been
nursed
long
enough
by
morgan
le
fay
in
the
island
of
avalon
the
tradition
was
that
king
arthur
lived
upon
this
island
in
an
enchanted
castle
which
had
the
power
of
a
magnet
so
that
every
one
who
came
near
it
was
drawn
thither
and
could
not
get
away
morgan
le
fay
was
its
ruler
called
more
correctly
morgan
la
fée
or
the
fairy
and
her
name
morgan
meant
by
one
tradition
the
queens
who
bore
away
arthur
were
accompanied
in
the
boat
by
the
bard
and
enchanter
merlin
who
had
long
been
the
king
adviser
and
this
is
the
description
of
the
island
said
to
have
been
given
by
merlin
to
another
bard
taliessin
came
to
that
green
and
fertile
island
which
each
year
is
blessed
with
two
autumns
two
springs
two
summers
two
gatherings
of
fruit
the
land
where
pearls
are
found
where
the
flowers
spring
as
you
gather
them
that
isle
of
orchards
called
the
isle
of
the
blessed
no
tillage
there
no
coulter
to
tear
the
bosom
of
the
earth
without
labor
it
affords
wheat
and
the
grape
there
the
lives
extend
beyond
a
century
there
nine
sisters
whose
will
is
the
only
law
rule
over
those
who
go
from
us
to
them
the
eldest
excels
in
the
art
of
healing
and
exceeds
her
sisters
in
beauty
she
is
called
morgana
and
knows
the
virtues
of
all
the
herbs
of
the
meadow
she
can
change
her
form
and
soar
in
the
air
like
a
bird
she
can
be
where
she
pleases
in
a
moment
and
in
a
moment
descend
on
our
coasts
from
the
clouds
her
sister
thiten
is
renowned
for
her
skill
on
the
harp
the
prince
we
arrived
and
morgana
received
us
with
fitting
honour
and
in
her
own
chamber
she
placed
the
king
on
a
bed
of
gold
and
with
delicate
touch
she
uncovered
the
wound
long
she
considered
it
and
at
length
said
to
him
that
she
could
heal
it
if
he
stayed
long
with
her
and
willed
her
to
attempt
her
cure
rejoiced
at
this
news
we
intrusted
the
king
to
her
care
and
soon
after
set
sail
sir
thomas
malory
who
wrote
the
book
called
the
historie
of
king
arthur
or

commonly

xi
maelduin
voyage
an
irish
knight
named
maelduin
set
forth
early
in
the
eighth
century
to
seek
round
the
seas
for
his
father
murderers
by
the
advice
of
a
wizard
he
was
to
take
with
him
seventeen
companions
neither
less
nor
more
but
at
the
last
moment
his
three
foster
brothers
whom
he
had
not
included
begged
to
go
with
him
he
refused
and
they
cast
themselves
into
the
sea
to
swim
after
his
vessel
maelduin
had
pity
on
them
and
took
them
in
but
his
disregard
of
the
wizard
advice
brought
punishment
and
it
was
only
after
long
wanderings
after
visiting
multitudes
of
unknown
and
often
enchanted
islands
and
after
the
death
or
loss
of
the
three
foster
brothers
that
maelduin
was
able
to
return
to
his
native
land
one
island
which
they
visited
was
divided
into
four
parts
by
four
fences
one
of
gold
one
of
silver
one
of
brass
one
of
crystal
in
the
first
division
there
dwelt
kings
in
the
second
queens
in
the
third
warriors
and
in
the
fourth
maidens
the
voyagers
landed
in
the
maidens
realm
one
of
these
came
out
in
a
boat
and
gave
them
food
such
that
every
one
found
in
it
the
taste
he
liked
best
then
followed
an
enchanted
drink
which
made
them
sleep
for
three
days
and
three
nights
when
they
awakened
they
were
in
their
boat
on
the
sea
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
either
of
island
or
maidens
the
next
island
had
in
it
a
fortress
with
a
brazen
door
and
a
bridge
of
glass
on
which
every
one
who
ascended
it
slipped
and
fell
a
woman
came
from
the
fortress
pail
in
hand
drew
water
from
the
sea
and
returned
not
answering
them
when
they
spoke
when
they
reached
at
last
the
brazen
door
and
struck
upon
it
it
made
a
sweet
and
soothing
sound
and
they
went
to
sleep
for
three
days
and
nights
as
before
on
the
fourth
day
a
maiden
came
who
was
most
beautiful
she
wore
garments
of
white
silk
a
white
mantle
with
a
brooch
of
silver
with
studs
of
gold
and
a
gold
band
round
her
hair
she
greeted
each
man
by
his
name
and
said
it
is
long
that
we
have
expected
you
she
took
them
into
the
castle
and
gave
them
every
kind
of
food
they
had
ever
desired
maelduin
was
filled
with
love
for
her
and
asked
her
for
her
love
but
she
told
him
that
love
was
sin
and
she
had
no
knowledge
of
sin
so
she
left
him
on
the
morrow
they
found
their
boat
stranded
on
a
crag
while
lady
and
fortress
and
island
had
all
vanished
another
island
on
which
they
landed
was
large
and
bare
with
another
fortress
and
a
palace
there
they
met
a
lady
who
was
kinder
she
wore
an
embroidered
purple
mantle
gold
embroidered
gloves
and
ornamented
sandals
and
was
just
riding
up
to
the
palace
door
seventeen
maidens
waited
there
for
her
she
offered
to
keep
the
strangers
as
guests
and
that
each
of
them
should
have
a
wife
she
herself
wedding
maelduin
she
was
it
seems
the
widow
of
the
king
of
the
island
and
these
were
her
seventeen
daughters
she
ruled
the
island
and
went
every
day
to
judge
the
people
and
direct
their
lives
if
the
strangers
would
stay
she
said
that
they
should
never
more
know
sorrow
or
hardships
or
old
age
she
herself
in
spite
of
her
large
family
being
young
and
beautiful
as
ever
they
stayed
three
months
and
it
seemed
to
all
but
maelduin
that
the
three
months
were
three
years
when
the
queen
was
absent
one
day
the
men
took
the
boat
and
compelled
maelduin
to
leave
the
island
with
them
but
the
queen
rode
after
them
and
flung
a
rope
which
maelduin
caught
and
which
clung
to
his
hand
she
drew
them
back
to
the
shore
this
happened
thrice
and
the
men
accused
maelduin
of
catching
the
rope
on
purpose
he
bade
another
man
catch
it
and
his
companions
cut
off
his
hand
and
they
escaped
at
last
on
one
island
the
seafarers
found
three
magic
apples
and
each
apple
gave
sufficient
food
for
forty
nights
again
on
another
island
they
found
the
same
apples
in
another
place
still
a
great
bird
like
a
cloud
arrived
with
a
tree
larger
than
an
oak
in
its
claws
after
a
while
two
eagles
came
and
cleaned
the
feathers
of
the
larger
bird
they
also
stripped
off
the
red
berries
from
the
tree
and
threw
them
into
the
ocean
until
its
foam
grew
red
the
great
bird
then
flew
into
the
ocean
and
cleaned
itself
this
happened
daily
for
three
days
when
the
great
bird
flew
away
with
stronger
wings
its
youth
being
thus
renewed
they
came
to
another
island
where
many
people
stood
by
the
shore
talking
and
joking
they
were
all
looking
at
maelduin
and
his
comrades
and
kept
gaping
and
laughing
but
would
not
exchange
a
word
with
them
then
maelduin
sent
one
of
his
foster
brothers
on
the
island
but
he
ranged
himself
with
the
others
and
did
as
they
did
maelduin
and
his
men
rowed
round
and
round
the
island
and
whenever
they
passed
the
point
where
this
comrade
was
they
addressed
him
but
he
never
answered
and
only
gaped
and
laughed
they
waited
for
him
a
long
time
and
left
him
this
island
they
found
to
be
called
the
island
of
joy
on
another
island
they
found
sheep
grazing
of
enormous
size
on
another
birds
whose
eggs
when
eaten
caused
feathers
to
sprout
all
over
the
bodies
of
those
who
eat
them
on
another
they
found
crimson
flowers
whose
mere
perfume
sufficed
for
food
and
they
encountered
women
whose
only
food
was
apples
through
the
window
flew
three
birds
a
blue
one
with
a
crimson
head
a
crimson
one
with
a
green
head
a
green
one
with
a
golden
head
these
sang
heavenly
music
and
were
sent
to
accompany
the
wanderers
on
their
departing
the
queen
of
the
island
gave
them
an
emerald
cup
such
that
water
poured
into
it
became
wine
she
asked
if
they
knew
how
long
they
had
been
there
and
when
they
said
a
day
she
told
them
that
it
was
a
year
during
which
they
had
had
no
food
as
they
sailed
away
the
birds
sang
to
them
until
both
birds
and
island
disappeared
in
the
mist
they
saw
another
island
standing
on
a
single
pedestal
as
if
on
one
foot
projecting
from
the
water
rowing
round
it
to
seek
a
way
into
it
they
found
no
passage
but
they
saw
in
the
base
of
the
pedestal
under
water
a
closed
door
with
a
lock
this
being
the
only
way
in
which
the
island
could
be
entered
around
another
island
there
was
a
fiery
rampart
which
constantly
moved
in
a
circle
in
the
side
of
that
rampart
was
an
open
door
and
as
it
came
opposite
them
in
its
turning
course
they
beheld
through
it
the
island
and
all
therein
and
its
occupants
even
human
beings
were
many
and
beautiful
wearing
rich
garments
and
feasting
with
gold
vessels
in
their
hands
the
voyagers
lingered
long
to
gaze
upon
this
marvel
on
another
island
they
found
many
human
beings
black
in
color
and
raiment
and
always
bewailing
lots
were
cast
and
another
of
foster
brothers
was
sent
on
shore
he
at
once
joined
the
weeping
crowd
and
did
as
they
did
two
others
were
sent
to
bring
him
back
and
both
shared
his
fate
falling
under
some
strange
spell
then
maelduin
sent
four
others
and
bade
them
look
neither
at
the
land
nor
at
the
sky
to
wrap
their
mouths
and
noses
with
their
garments
and
not
breathe
the
island
air
and
not
to
take
off
their
eyes
from
their
comrades
in
this
way
the
two
who
followed
the
foster
brother
on
shore
were
rescued
but
he
remained
behind
of
another
island
they
could
see
nothing
but
a
fort
protected
by
a
great
white
rampart
on
which
nothing
living
was
to
be
seen
but
a
small
cat
leaping
from
one
to
another
of
four
stone
pillars
they
found
brooches
and
ornaments
of
gold
and
silver
they
found
white
quilts
and
embroidered
garments
hanging
up
flitches
of
bacon
were
suspended
a
whole
ox
was
roasting
and
vessels
stood
filled
with
intoxicating
drinks
maelduin
asked
the
cat
if
all
this
was
for
them
but
the
cat
merely
looked
at
him
and
went
on
playing
the
seafarers
dined
and
drank
then
went
to
sleep
as
they
were
about
to
depart
maelduin
third
foster
brother
proposed
to
carry
off
a
tempting
necklace
and
in
spite
of
his
leader
warnings
grasped
it
instantly
the
cat
leaped
through
him
like
a
fiery
arrow
burned
him
so
that
he
became
ashes
and
went
back
to
its
pillar
thus
all
three
of
the
foster
brothers
who
had
disregarded
the
wizard
warning
and
forced
themselves
upon
the
party
were
either
killed
or
left
behind
upon
the
enchanted
islands
around
another
island
there
was
a
demon
going
on
the
riders
were
just
riding
in
over
the
sea
and
then
the
race
began
the
voyagers
could
only
dimly
perceive
the
forms
of
the
horses
but
could
hear
the
cries
of
their
riders
the
strokes
of
the
whips
and
the
words
of
the
spectators
see
the
gray
horse
watch
the
chestnut
horse
and
the
voyagers
were
so
alarmed
that
they
rowed
away
the
next
island
was
covered
with
trees
laden
with
golden
apples
but
these
were
being
rapidly
eaten
by
small
scarlet
animals
which
they
found
on
coming
nearer
to
be
all
made
of
fire
and
thus
brightened
in
hue
then
the
animals
vanished
and
maelduin
with
his
men
landed
and
though
the
ground
was
still
hot
from
the
fiery
creatures
they
brought
away
a
boat
load
of
the
apples
another
island
was
divided
into
two
parts
by
a
brass
wall
across
the
middle
there
were
two
flocks
of
sheep
and
those
on
one
side
of
the
wall
were
white
while
the
others
were
black
a
large
man
was
dividing
and
arranging
the
sheep
and
threw
them
easily
over
the
wall
when
he
threw
a
white
sheep
among
the
black
ones
it
became
black
and
when
he
threw
a
black
sheep
among
the
white
ones
it
became
white
instantly
the
voyagers
thought
of
landing
but
when
maelduin
saw
this
he
said
let
us
throw
something
on
shore
to
see
if
it
will
change
color
if
it
does
we
will
avoid
the
island
so
they
took
a
black
branch
and
threw
it
toward
the
white
sheep
when
it
fell
it
grew
white
and
the
same
with
a
white
branch
on
the
black
side
it
is
lucky
for
us
said
maelduin
that
we
did
not
land
on
this
island
they
came
next
to
an
island
where
there
was
but
one
man
visible
very
aged
and
with
long
white
hair
above
him
were
trees
covered
with
great
numbers
of
birds
the
old
man
told
them
that
he
like
them
had
come
in
a
curragh
or
coracle
and
had
placed
many
green
sods
beneath
his
feet
to
steady
the
boat
reaching
this
spot
the
green
sods
had
joined
together
and
formed
an
island
which
at
first
gave
him
hardly
room
to
stand
but
every
year
one
foot
was
added
to
its
size
and
one
tree
grew
up
he
had
lived
there
for
centuries
and
those
birds
were
the
souls
of
his
children
and
descendants
each
of
whom
was
sent
there
after
death
and
they
were
all
fed
from
heaven
each
day
on
the
next
island
there
was
a
great
roaring
as
of
bellows
and
a
sound
of
smiths
hammers
as
if
striking
all
together
on
an
anvil
every
sound
seeming
to
come
from
the
strokes
of
a
dozen
men
are
they
near
asked
one
big
voice
silence
said
another
and
they
were
evidently
watching
for
the
boat
when
it
rowed
away
one
of
the
smiths
flung
after
them
a
vast
mass
of
iron
which
he
had
grasped
with
the
tongs
from
the
furnace
it
fell
just
short
but
made
the
whole
sea
to
hiss
and
boil
around
them
as
they
rowed
away
another
island
had
a
wall
of
water
round
it
and
maelduin
and
his
men
saw
multitudes
of
people
driving
away
herds
of
cattle
and
sheep
and
shouting
there
they
are
they
have
come
again
and
a
woman
pelted
them
from
below
with
great
nuts
which
the
crew
gathered
for
eating
then
as
they
rowed
away
they
heard
one
man
say
where
are
they
now
and
another
cried
they
are
going
away
still
again
they
visited
an
island
where
a
great
stream
of
water
shot
up
into
the
air
and
made
an
arch
like
a
rainbow
that
spanned
the
land
they
walked
below
it
without
getting
wet
and
hooked
down
from
it
many
large
salmon
besides
that
many
fell
out
above
their
heads
so
that
they
had
more
than
they
could
carry
away
with
them
these
are
by
no
means
all
of
the
strange
adventures
of
maelduin
and
his
men
the
last
island
to
which
they
came
was
called
raven
stream
and
there
one
of
the
men
who
had
been
very
homesick
leaped
out
upon
shore
as
soon
as
he
touched
the
land
he
became
a
heap
of
ashes
as
if
his
body
had
lain
in
the
earth
a
thousand
years
this
showed
them
for
the
first
time
during
how
vast
a
period
they
had
been
absent
and
what
a
space
they
must
have
traversed
instead
of
thirty
enchanted
islands
they
had
visited
thrice
fifty
many
of
them
twice
or
thrice
as
large
as
ireland
whence
the
voyagers
first
came
in
the
wonderful
experiences
of
their
long
lives
they
had
apparently
lost
sight
of
the
search
which
they
had
undertaken
for
the
murderers
of
maelduin
father
since
of
them
we
hear
no
more
the
island
enchantment
seems
to
have
banished
all
other
thoughts
xii
the
voyage
of
brandan
the
young
student
brandan
was
awakened
in
the
morning
by
the
crowing
of
the
cock
in
the
great
irish
abbey
where
he
dwelt
he
rose
washed
his
face
and
hands
and
dressed
himself
then
passed
into
the
chapel
where
he
prayed
and
sang
until
the
dawn
of
the
day
with
song
comes
courage
was
the
motto
of
the
abbey
it
was
one
of
those
institutions
like
great
colonies
church
library
farm
workshop
college
all
in
one
of
which
ireland
in
the
sixth
century
was
full
and
which
existed
also
elsewhere
their
extent
is
best
seen
by
the
modern
traveller
in
the
remains
of
the
vast
buildings
at
tintern
in
england
scattered
over
a
wide
extent
of
country
where
you
keep
coming
upon
walls
and
fragments
of
buildings
which
once
formed
a
part
of
a
single
great
institution
in
which
all
the
life
of
the
community
was
organized
as
was
the
case
in
the
spanish
missions
of
california
at
the
abbey
of
bangor
in
wales
for
instance
there
were
two
thousand
four
hundred
men
all
under
the
direction
of
a
comparatively
small
body
of
monks
who
were
trained
to
an
amount
of
organizing
skill
like
that
now
needed
for
a
great
railway
system
some
of
these
men
were
occupied
in
various
mechanic
arts
some
in
mining
but
most
of
them
in
agriculture
which
they
carried
on
with
their
own
hands
without
the
aid
of
animals
and
in
total
silence
having
thus
labored
in
the
fields
until
noonday
brandan
then
returned
that
he
might
work
in
the
library
transcribing
ancient
manuscripts
or
illustrating
books
of
prayer
having
to
observe
silence
he
wrote
the
name
of
the
book
to
give
to
the
librarian
and
if
it
were
a
christian
work
he
stretched
out
his
hand
making
motions
with
his
fingers
as
if
turning
over
the
leaves
but
if
it
were
by
a
pagan
author
the
monk
who
asked
for
it
was
required
to
scratch
his
ear
as
a
dog
does
to
show
his
contempt
because
the
regulations
said
an
unbeliever
might
well
be
compared
to
that
animal
taking
the
book
he
copied
it
in
the
scriptorium
or
library
or
took
it
to
his
cell
where
he
wrote
all
winter
without
a
fire
it
is
to
such
monks
that
we
owe
all
our
knowledge
of
the
earliest
history
of
england
and
ireland
though
doubtless
the
hand
that
wrote
the
histories
of
gildas
and
bede
grew
as
tired
as
that
of
brandan
or
as
that
of
the
monk
who
wrote
in
the
corner
of
a
beautiful
manuscript
he
who
does
not
know
how
to
write
imagines
it
to
be
no
labor
but
though
only
three
fingers
hold
the
pen
the
whole
body
grows
weary
in
the
same
way
brandan
may
have
learned
music
and
have
had
an
organ
in
his
monastery
or
have
had
a
school
of
art
painting
beautiful
miniatures
for
the
holy
missals
this
was
his
early
life
in
the
convent

was

at

some
three
or

hundred
who
constantly
came
and
went

upon
whom
the
monks
and
young
disciples
waited
after
the
meal
the
monks
spent
three
hours
in
the
chapel
on
their
knees
still
silent
then
they
confessed
in
turn
to
the
abbot
and
then
sought
their
rest
they
held
all
things
in
common
no
one
even
received
a
gift
for
himself
war
never
reached
them
it
was
the
rarest
thing
for
an
armed
party
to
molest
their
composure
their
domains
were
regarded
as
a
haven
for
the
stormy
world
because
there
were
so
many
such
places
in
ireland
it
was
known
as
the
isle
of
saints
brandan
was
sent
after
a
time
to
other
abbeys
where
he
could
pursue
especial
studies
for
they
had
six
branches
of
learning
grammar
rhetoric
dialectics
geometry
astronomy
and
music
thus
he
passed
three
years
and
was
then
advised
to
go
to
an
especial
teacher
in
the
mountains
who
had
particular
modes
of
teaching
certain
branches
but
this
priest
he
was
an
italian
was
suffering
from
poverty
and
could
receive
his
guest
but
for
a
few
weeks
one
day
as
brandan
sat
studying
he
saw
the
legend
says
a
white
mouse
come
from
a
crack
in
the
wall
a
visitor
which
climbed
upon
his
table
and
left
there
a
grain
of
wheat
then
the
mouse
paused
looked
at
the
student
then
ran
about
the
table
went
away
and
reappeared
with
another
grain
and
another
up
to
five
brandan
who
had
at
the
very
instant
learned
his
lesson
rose
from
his
seat
followed
the
mouse
and
looking
through
a
hole
in
the
wall
saw
a
great
pile
of
wheat
stored
in
a
concealed
apartment
on
his
showing
this
to
the
head
of
the
convent
it
was
pronounced
a
miracle
the
food
was
distributed
to
the
poor
and
the
people
blessed
his
charity
while
the
lord
blessed
his
studies
in
the
course
of
years
brandan
became
himself
the
head
of
one
of
the
great
abbeys
that
of
clonfert
of
the
order
of
benedict
where
he
had
under
him
nearly
three
thousand
monks
in
this
abbey
having
one
day
given
hospitality
to
a
monk
named
berinthus
who
had
just
returned
from
an
ocean
voyage
brandan
learned
from
him
the
existence
far
off
in
the
ocean
of
an
island
called
the
delicious
isle
to
which
a
priest
named
mernoc
had
retired
with
many
companions
of
his
order
berinthus
found
mernoc
and
the
other
monks
living
apart
from
one
another
for
purposes
of
prayer
but
when
they
came
together
mernoc
said
they
were
like
bees
from
different
beehives
they
met
for
their
food
and
for
church
their
food
included
only
apples
nuts
and
various
herbs
one
day
mernoc
said
to
berinthus
i
will
conduct
you
to
the
promised
isle
of
the
saints
so
they
went
on
board
a
little
ship
and
sailed
westward
through
a
thick
fog
until
a
great
light
shone
and
they
found
themselves
near
an
island
which
was
large
and
fruitful
and
bore
many
apples
there
were
no
herbs
without
blossoms
he
said
nor
trees
without
fruits
and
there
were
precious
stones
and
the
island
was
traversed
by
a
great
river
then
they
met
a
man
of
shining
aspect
who
told
them
that
they
had
without
knowing
it
passed
a
year
already
in
the
island
that
they
had
needed
neither
food
nor
sleep
then
they
returned
to
the
delicious
island
and
every
one
knew
where
they
had
been
by
the
perfume
of
their
garments
this
was
the
story
of
berinthus
and
from
this
time
forward
nothing
could
keep
brandan
from
the
purpose
of
beholding
for
himself
these
blessed
islands
before
carrying
out
his
plans
however
he
went
about
the
year
to
visit
an
abbot
named
enda
who
lived
at
arran
then
called
isle
of
the
saints
a
priest
who
was
supposed
to
know
more
than
any
one
concerning
the
farther
lands
of
the
western
sea
he
knew
for
instance
of
the
enchanted
island
named
which
could
be
seen
from
the
coast
of
ireland
only
once
in
seven
years
and
which
the
priests
had
vainly
tried
to
disenchant
some
islands
it
was
believed
had
been
already
disenchanted
by
throwing
on
them
a
few
sparks
of
lighted
turf
but
as
was
too
far
for
this
there
were
repeated
efforts
to
disenchant
it
by
shooting
fiery
arrows
towards
it
though
this
had
not
yet
been
successful
then
enda
could
tell
of
wonderful
ways
to
cross
the
sea
without
a
boat
how
his
sister
fanchea
had
done
it
by
spreading
her
own
cloak
upon
the
waves
and
how
she
and
three
other
nuns
were
borne
upon
it
she
found
however
that
one
hem
of
the
cloak
sank
below
the
water
because
one
of
her
companions
had
brought
with
her
against
orders
a
brazen
vessel
from
the
convent
but
on
her
throwing
it
away
the
sinking
hem
rose
to
the
level
of
the
rest
and
bore
them
safely
enda
himself
had
first
crossed
to
arran
on
a
large
stone
which
he
had
ordered
his
followers
to
place
on
the
water
and
which
floated
before
the
wind
and
he
told
of
another
priest
who
had
walked
on
the
sea
as
on
a
meadow
and
plucked
flowers
as
he
went
hearing
such
tales
how
could
brandan
fear
to
enter
on
his
voyage
he
caused
a
boat
to
be
built
of
a
fashion
which
one
may
still
see
in
welsh
and
irish
rivers
and
known
as
a
curragh
or
coracle
made
of
an
osier
frame
covered
with
tanned
and
oiled
skins
he
took
with
him
seventeen
priests
among
whom
was
malo
then
a
mere
boy
but
afterwards
celebrated
they
sailed
to
the
southwest
and
after
being
forty
days
at
sea
they
reached
a
rocky
island
furrowed
with
streams
where
they
received
the
kindest
hospitality
and
took
in
fresh
provisions
they
sailed
again
the
next
day
and
found
themselves
entangled
in
contrary
currents
and
perplexing
winds
so
that
they
were
long
in
reaching
another
island
green
and
fertile
watered
by
rivers
which
were
full
of
fish
and
covered
with
vast
herds
of
sheep
as
large
as
heifers
here
they
renewed
their
stock
of
provisions
and
chose
a
spotless
lamb
with
which
to
celebrate
easter
sunday
on
another
island
which
they
saw
at
a
short
distance
this
island
was
wholly
bare
without
sandy
shores
or
wooded
slopes
and
they
all
landed
upon
it
to
cook
their
lamb
but
when
they
had
arranged
their
and
when
their
fire
began
to
blaze
the
island
seemed
to
move
beneath
their
feet
and
they
ran
in
terror
to
their
boat
from
which
brandan
had
not
yet
landed
their
supposed
island
was
a
whale
and
they
rowed
hastily
away
from
it
toward
the
island
they
had
left
while
the
whale
glided
away
still
showing
at
a
distance
of
two
miles
the
fire
blazing
on
his
back
the
next
island
they
visited
was
wooded
and
fertile
where
they
found
a
multitude
of
birds
which
chanted
with
them
the
praises
of
the
lord
so
that
they
called
this
the
paradise
of
birds
this
was
the
description
given
of
this
island
by
an
old
writer
named
wynkyn
de
worde
in
the
golden
legend
soon
after
as
god
would
they
saw
a
fair
island
full
of
flowers
herbs
and
trees
whereof
they
thanked
god
of
his
good
grace
and
anon
they
went
on
land
and
when
they
had
gone
long
in
this
they
found
a
full
fayre
well
and
thereby
stood
a
fair
tree
full
of
boughs
and
on
every
bough
sat
a
fayre
bird
and
they
sat
so
thick
on
the
tree
that
uneath
scarcely
any
leaf
of
the
tree
might
be
seen
the
number
of
them
was
so
great
and
they
sang
so
merrilie
that
it
was
an
heavenlie
noise
to
hear
whereupon
brandan
kneeled
down
on
his
knees
and
wept
for
joy
and
made
his
praise
devoutlie
to
our
lord
god
to
know
what
these
birds
meant
and
then
anon
one
of
the
birds
flew
from
the
tree
to
brandan
and
he
with
the
flickering
of
his
wings
made
a
full
merrie
noise
like
a
fiddle
that
him
seemed
he
never
heard
so
joyful
a
melodie
and
then
brandan
commanded
the
foule
to
tell
him
the
cause
why
they
sat
so
thick
on
the
tree
and
sang
so
merrilie
and
then
the
foule
said
some
time
we
were
angels
in
heaven
but
when
our
master
lucifer
fell
down
into
hell
for
his
high
pride
and
we
fell
with
him
for
our
offences
some
higher
and
some
lower
after
the
quality
of
the
trespasse
and
because
our
trespasse
is
so
little
therefore
our
lord
hath
sent
us
here
out
of
all
paine
in
full
great
joy
and
mirthe
after
his
pleasing
here
to
serve
him
on
this
tree
in
the
best
manner
we
can
the
sundaie
is
a
daie
of
rest
from
all
worldly
occupation
and
therefore
that
day
all
we
be
made
as
white
as
any
snow
for
to
praise
our
lorde
in
the
best
wise
we
may
and
then
all
the
birds
began
to
sing
evensong
so
merrilie
that
it
was
an
heavenlie
noise
to
hear
and
after
supper
brandan
and
his
fellows
went
to
bed
and
slept
well
and
in
the
morn
they
arose
by
times
and
then
those
foules
began
mattyns
prime
and
hours
and
all
such
service
as
christian
men
used
to
sing
and
brandan
with
his
fellows
abode
there
seven
weeks
until
trinity
sunday
was
passed
having
then
embarked
they
wandered
for
months
on
the
ocean
before
reaching
another
island
that
on
which
they
finally
landed
was
inhabited
by
monks
who
had
as
their
patrons
patrick
and
ailbée
and
they
spent
christmas
there
a
year
passed
in
these
voyages
and
the
tradition
is
that
for
six
other
years
they
made
just
the
same
circuit
always
spending
holy
week
at
the
island
where
they
found
the
sheep
alighting
for
easter
on
the
back
of
the
same
patient
whale
visiting
the
isle
of
birds
at
pentecost
and
reaching
the
island
of
patrick
and
ailbée
in
time
for
christmas
but
in
the
seventh
year
they
met
with
wholly
new
perils
they
were
attacked
the
legend
says
first
by
a
whale
then
by
a
griffin
and
then
by
a
race
of
cyclops
or
giants
then
they
came
to
an
island
where
the
whale
which
had
attacked
them
was
thrown
on
shore
so
that
they
could
cut
him
to
pieces
then
another
island
which
had
great
fruits
and
was
called
the
island
of
the
strong
man
and
lastly
one
where
the
grapes
filled
the
air
with
perfume
after
this
they
saw
an
island
all
cinders
and
flames
where
the
cyclops
had
their
forges
and
they
sailed
away
in
the
light
of
an
immense
fire
the
next
day
they
saw
looking
northward
a
great
and
high
mountain
sending
out
flames
at
the
top
turning
hastily
from
this
dreadful
sight
they
saw
a
little
round
island
at
the
top
of
which
a
hermit
dwelt
who
gave
them
his
benediction
then
they
sailed
southward
once
more
and
stopped
at
their
usual
places
of
resort
for
holy
week
easter
and
whitsuntide
it
was
on
this
trip
that
they
had
so
the
legend
says
that
strange
interview
with
judas
iscariot
out
of
which
matthew
arnold
has
made
a
ballad
sailing
in
the
wintry
northern
seas
at
christmas
time
brandan
saw
an
iceberg
floating
by
on
which
a
human
form
rested
motionless
and
when
it
moved
at
last
he
saw
by
its
resemblance
to
the
painted
pictures
he
had
seen
that
it
must
be
judas
iscariot
who
had
died
five
centuries
before
then
as
the
boat
floated
near
the
iceberg
judas
spoke
and
told
him
his
tale
after
he
had
betrayed
jesus
christ
after
he
had
died
and
had
been
consigned
to
the
flames
of
hell
which
were
believed
in
very
literally
in
those
days
an
angel
came
to
him
on
christmas
night
and
said
that
he
might
go
thence
and
cool
himself
for
an
hour
why
this
mercy
asked
judas
iscariot
then
the
angel
said
to
him
remember
the
leper
in
joppa
and
poor
judas
recalled
how
once
when
the
hot
wind
called
the
sirocco
swept
through
the
streets
of
joppa
and
he
saw
a
naked
leper
by
the
wayside
sitting
in
agony
from
the
heat
and
the
drifting
sand
judas
had
thrown
his
cloak
over
him
for
a
shelter
and
received
his
thanks
in
reward
for
this
the
angel
now
told
him
he
was
to
have
once
a
year
an
hour
respite
from
his
pain
he
was
allowed
in
that
hour
to
fling
himself
on
an
iceberg
and
cool
his
burning
heat
as
he
drifted
through
the
northern
seas
then
brandan
bent
his
head
in
prayer
and
when
he
looked
up
the
hour
was
passed
and
judas
had
been
hurried
back
into
his
torments
it
seems
to
have
been
only
after
seven
years
of
this
wandering
that
they
at
last
penetrated
within
the
obscure
fogs
which
surrounded
the
isle
of
the
saints
and
came
upon
a
shore
which
lay
all
bathed
in
sunny
light
it
was
a
vast
island
sprinkled
with
precious
stones
and
covered
with
ripe
fruits
they
traversed
it
for
forty
days
without
arriving
at
the
end
though
they
reached
a
great
river
which
flowed
through
the
midst
of
it
from
east
to
west
there
an
angel
appeared
to
them
and
told
them
that
they
could
go
no
farther
but
could
return
to
their
own
abode
carrying
from
the
island
some
of
those
fruits
and
precious
stones
which
were
reserved
to
be
distributed
among
the
saints
when
all
the
world
should
be
brought
to
the
true
faith
in
order
to
hasten
that
time
it
appears
that
malo
the
youngest
of
the
monks
had
wished
in
his
zeal
to
baptize
some
one
and
had
therefore
dug
up
a
heathen
giant
who
had
been
for
some
reason
buried
on
the
blessed
isle
not
only
had
he
dug
the
giant
body
up
but
malo
had
brought
him
to
life
again
sufficiently
for
the
purpose
of
baptism
and
instruction
in
the
true
faith
after
which
he
gave
him
the

received
the
benediction
of
the
abbot
of
the
monastery
and
sailed
for
ireland
to
tell
their
brethren
of
the
wonders
they
had
seen
he
used
to
tell
them
especially
to
his
nurse
ita

whose
care
he
had
been
placed
until
his
fifth
year
his
monastery
at
clonfert
grew
as
has
been
said
to
include
three
thousand
monks
and
he
spent
his
remaining
years
in
peace
and
sanctity
the
supposed
islands
which
he
visited
are
still
believed
by
many
to
have
formed
a
part
of
the
american
continent
and
he
is
still
thought
by
some
irish
scholars
to
have
been
the
first
to
discover
this
hemisphere
nearly
a
thousand
years
before
columbus
although
this
view
has
not
yet
made
much
impression
on
historians
the
paradise
of
birds
in
particular
has
been
placed
by
these
scholars
in
mexico

irish
poet
has
written
a
long
poem
describing
the
delights
to
be
found

oft
in

sunny
mornings

i
seen
bright
yellow
birds
of
a
rich
lemon
hue
meeting
in
crowds
upon
the
branches
green
and
sweetly
singing
all
the
morning
through
and
others
with
their
heads
grayish
and
dark
pressing
their
cinnamon
cheeks
to
the
old
trees
and
striking
on
the
hard
rough
shrivelled
bark
like
conscience
on
a
bosom
ill
at
ease
and
chirping
their
single
notes
now
the
deep
blossoms
seen
now
floating
brightly
on
with
fiery
throats
small
winged
emeralds
of
golden
green
and
other
larger
birds
with
orange
cheeks
a
chattering
crowd
prattling
forever
with
their
curved
beaks

the
silent
woods
screaming
aloud
xiii
kirwan
search
for
the
boy
kirwan
lay
on
one
of
the
steep
cliffs
of
the
island
of
innismane
one
of
the
islands
of
arran
formerly
called
isles
of
the
saints
he
was
looking
across
the
atlantic
for
a
glimpse
of
this
was
what
they
called
it
it
was
a
mysterious
island
which
kirwan
grandfather
had
seen
or
thought
he
had
seen
and
kirwan
father
also
indeed
there
was
not
one
of
the
old
people
on
the
island
who
did
not
think
he
had
seen
it
and
the
older
they
were
the
oftener
it
had
been
seen
by
them
and
the
larger
it
looked
but
kirwan
had
never
seen
it
and
whenever
he
came
to
the
top
of
the
highest
cliff
where
he
often
went
he
climbed
the
great
mass
of
granite
called
the
gregory
and
peered
out
into
the
west
especially
at
sunset
in
hopes
that
he
would
at
least
catch
a
glimpse
some
happy
evening
of
the
cliffs
and
meadows
of
but
as
yet
he
had
never
espied
them
all
this
was
more
than
two
hundred
years
ago
he
naturally
went
up
to
the
gregory
at
this
hour
because
it
was
then
that
he
met
the
other
boys
and
caught
puffins
by
being
lowered
over
the
cliff
the
agent
of
the
island
employed
the
boys
and
paid
them
a
sixpence
for
every
dozen
birds
that
he
might
sell
the
feathers
the
boys
had
a
rope
three
hundred
feet
long
which
could
reach
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
one
of
them
tied
this
rope
around
his
waist
and
then
held
it
fast
with
both
hands
the
rope
being
held
above
by
four
or
five
strong
boys
who
lowered
the
cragman
or
clifter
as
he
was
called
over
the
precipice
kirwan
was
thus
lowered
to
the
rocks
near
the
sea
where
the
puffins
bred
and
loosening
the
rope
he
prepared
to
spend
the
night
in
catching
them
he
had
a
pole
with
a
snare
on
the
end
which
he
easily
clapped
on
the
heads
of
the
heavy
and
stupid
birds
then
tied
each
on
a
string
as
he
caught
it
and
so
kept
it
to
be
hauled
up
in
the
morning
he
took
in
this
way
twenty
or
thirty
score
of
the
birds
besides
quantities
of
their
large
eggs
which
were
found
in
deep
clefts
in
the
rock
and
these
he
carried
with
him
when
his
friends
came
in
the
morning
to
haul
him
up
it
was
a
good
school
of
courage
for
sometimes
boys
missed
their
footing
and
were
dashed
to
pieces
at
other
times
he
fished
in
his
father
boat
or
drove
calves
for
sale
on
the
mainland
or
cured
salt
after
high
tide
in
the
caverns
or
collected
kelp
for
the
farmers
but
he
was
always
looking
forward
to
a
time
when
he
might
get
a
glimpse
of
the
island
of
and
make
his
way
to
it
one
day
when
all
the
fleet
of
was
out
for
the
herring
fishery
and
kirwan
among
them
the
fog
came
in
closer
and
closer
and
he
was
shut
apart
from
all
others
his
companion
in
the
boat
or
as
it
would
be
called
in
new
england
had
gone
to
cut
bait
on
board
another
boat
but
kirwan
could
manage
the
boat
well
enough
alone
long
he
toiled
with
his
oars
toward
the
west
where
he
fancied
the
rest
of
the
fleet
to
be
and
sometimes
he
spread
his
little
steering
with
an
oar
a
thing
which
was
in
a
heavy
sea
almost
as
hard
as
rowing
at
last
the
fog
lifted
and
he
found
himself
alone
upon
the
ocean
he
had
lost
his
bearings
and
could
not
tell
the
points
of
the
compass
presently
out
of
a
heavy
bank
of
fog
which
rose
against
the
horizon
he
saw
what
seemed
land
it
gave
him
new
strength
and
he
worked
hard
to
reach
it
but
it
was
long
since
he
had
eaten
his
head
was
dizzy
and
he
lay
down
on
the
thwart
of
the
boat
rather
heedless
of
what
might
come
growing
weaker
and
weaker
he
did
not
clearly
know
what
he
was
doing
suddenly
he
started
up
for
a
voice
hailed
him
from
above
his
head
he
saw
above
him
the
high
stern
of
a
small
vessel
and
with
the
aid
of
a
sailor
he
was
helped
on
board
he
found
himself
on
the
deck
of
a
sloop
of
about
seventy
tons
john
nisbet
master
with
a
crew
of
seven
men
they
had
sailed
from
killebegs
county
donegal
in
ireland
for
the
coast
of
france
laden
with
butter
tallow
and
hides
and
were
now
returning
from
france
with
french
wines
and
were
befogged
as
kirwan
had
been
the
boy
was
at
once
taken
on
board
and
rated
as
a
seaman
and
the
later
adventures
of
the
trip
are
here
given
as
he
reported
them
on
his
return
with
the
ship
some
months
later
the
mist
continued
thicker
and
thicker
for
a
time
and
when
it
suddenly
furled
itself
away
they
found
themselves
on
an
unknown
coast
with
the
wind
driving
them
shoreward
there
were
men
on
board
who
were
familiar
with
the
whole
coast
of
ireland
and
scotland
but
they
remembered
nothing
like
this
finding
less
than
three
fathoms
of
water
they
came
to
anchor
and
sent
four
men
ashore
to
find
where
they
were
these
being
james
ross
the
carpenter
and
two
sailors
with
the
boy
kirwan
they
took
swords
and
pistols
landing
at
the
edge
of
a
little
wood
they
walked
for
a
mile
within
a
pleasant
valley
where
cattle
horses
and
sheep
were
feeding
and
then
came
in
sight
of
a
castle
small
but
strong
where
they
went
to
the
door
and
knocked
no
one
answered
and
they
walked
on
up
a
green
hill
where
there
were
multitudes
of
black
rabbits
but
when
they
had
reached
the
top
and
looked
around
they
could
see
no
inhabitants
nor
any
house
on
which
they
returned
to
the
sloop
and
told
their
tale
after
this
the
whole
ship
company
went
ashore
except
one
left
in
charge
and
they
wandered
about
for
hours
yet
saw
nothing
more
as
night
came
on
they
made
a
fire
at
the
base
of
a
fallen
oak
near
the
shore
and
lay
around
it
talking
and
smoking
the
lately
discovered
weed
tobacco
when
suddenly
they
heard
loud
noises
from
the
direction
of
the
castle
and
then
all
over
the
island
which
frightened
them
so
that
they
went
on
board
the
sloop
and
stayed
all
night
the
next
morning
they
saw
a
dignified
elderly
gentleman
with
ten
unarmed
followers
coming
down
towards
the
shore
hailing
the
sloop
the
older
gentleman
speaking
gaelic
asked
who
and
whence
they
were
and
being
told
invited
them
ashore
as
his
guests
they
went
on
shore
well
armed
and
he
embraced
them
one
by
one
telling
them
that
they
were
the
happiest
sight
that
island
had
seen
for
hundreds
of
years
that
it
was
called
or
that
his
ancestors
had
been
princes
of
it
but
for
many
years
it
had
been
taken
possession
of
by
enchanters
who
kept
it
almost
always
invisible
so
that
no
ship
came
there
and
that
for
the
same
reason
he
and
his
friends
were
rendered
unable
to
answer
the
sailors
even
when
they
knocked
at
the
door
and
that
the
enchantment
must
remain
until
a
fire
was
kindled
on
the
island
by
good
christians
this
had
been
done
the
night
before
and
the
terrible
noises
which
they
had
heard
were
from
the
powers
of
darkness
which
had
now
left
the
island
forever
and
indeed
when
the
sailors
were
led
to
the
castle
they
saw
that
the
chief
tower
had
just
been
demolished
by
the
powers
of
darkness
as
they
retreated
but
there
were
sitting
within
the
halls
men
and
women
of
dignified
appearance
who
thanked
them
for
the
good
service
they
had
done
then
they
were
taken
over
the
island
which
proved
to
be
some
sixty
miles
long
and
thirty
wide
abounding
with
horses
cattle
sheep
deer
rabbits
and
birds
but
without
any
swine
it
had
also
rich
mines
of
silver
and
gold
but
few
people
although
there
were
ruins
of
old
towns
and
cities
the
sailors
after
being
richly
rewarded
were
sent
on
board
their
vessel
and
furnished
with
sailing
directions
to
their
port
on
reaching
home
they
showed
to
the
minister
of
their
town
the
pieces
of
gold
and
silver
that
were
given
them
at
the
island
these
being
of
an
ancient
stamp
somewhat
rusty
yet
of
pure
gold
and
there
was
at
once
an
eager
desire
on
the
part
of
certain
of
the
townsmen
to
go
with
them
within
a
week
an
expedition
was
fitted
out
containing
several
godly
ministers
who
wished
to
visit
and
discover
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
but
through
some
mishap
of
the
seas
this
expedition
was
never
heard
of
again
partly
for
this
reason
and
partly
because
none
of
captain
nesbit
crew
wished
to
return
to
the
island
there
came
to
be
in
time
a
feeling
of
distrust
about
all
this
rediscovery
of
or
there
were
not
wanting
those
who
held
that
the
ancient
gold
pieces
might
have
been
gained
by
piracy
such
as
was
beginning
to
be
known
upon
the
spanish
main
and
as
for
the
boy
kirwan
some
of
his
playmates
did
not
hesitate
to
express
the
opinion
that
he
had
always
been
as
they
phrased
it
the
greatest
liar
that
ever
spoke
what
is
certain
is
that
the
island
of
brazil
or
had
appeared
on
maps
ever
since
as
being
near
the
coast
of
ireland
that
many
voyages
were
made
from
bristol
to
find
it
a
hundred
years
later
that
it
was
mentioned
about
as
often
seen
from
the
shore
and
that
it
appeared
as
brazil
rock
on
the
london
admiralty
charts
until
after
if
many
people
tried
to
find
it
and
failed
why
should
not
kirwan
have
tried
and
succeeded
and
as
to
his
stretching
his
story
a
little
by
throwing
in
a
few
enchanters
and
magic
castles
there
was
not
a
voyager
of
his
period
who
was
not
tempted
to
do
the
same
xiv
the
isle
of
satan
hand
the
prosperous
farmer
conall
ua
corra
in
the
province
of
connaught
had
everything
to
make
him
happy
except
that
he
and
his
wife
had
no
children
to
cheer
their
old
age
and
inherit
their
estate
conall
had
prayed
for
children
and
one
day
said
in
his
impatience
that
he
would
rather
have
them
sent
by
satan
than
not
have
them
at
all
a
year
or
two
later
his
wife
had
three
sons
at
a
birth
and
when
these
sons
came
to
maturity
they
were
so
ridiculed
by
other
young
men
as
being
the
sons
of
satan
that
they
said
if
such
is
really
our
parentage
we
will
do
satan
work
so
they
collected
around
them
a
few
villains
and
began
plundering
and
destroying
the
churches
in
the
neighborhood
and
thus
injuring
half
the
church
buildings
in
the
country
at
last
they
resolved
to
visit
also
the
church
of
clothar
to
destroy
it
and
to
kill
if
necessary
their
mother
father
who
was
the
leading
layman
of
the
parish
when
they
came
to
the
church
they
found
the
old
man
on
the
green
in
front
of
it
distributing
meat
and
drink
to
his
tenants
and
the
people
of
the
parish
seeing
this
they
postponed
their
plans
until
after
dark
and
in
the
meantime
went
home
with
their
grandfather
to
spend
the
night
at
his
house
they
went
to
rest
and
the
eldest
lochan
had
a
terrible
dream
in
which
he
saw
first
the
joys
of
heaven
and
then
the
terrors
of
future
punishment
and
then
he
awoke
in
dismay
waking
his
brothers
he
told
them
his
dream
and
that
he
now
saw
that
they
had
been
serving
evil
masters
and
making
war
upon
a
good
one
such
was
his
bitterness
of
remorse
that
he
converted
them
to
his
views
and
they
agreed
to
go
to
their
grandfather
in
the
morning
renounce
their
sinful
ways
and
ask
his
pardon
this
they
did
and
he
advised
them
to
go
to
a
celebrated
saint
finnen
of
clonard
and
take
him
as
their
spiritual
guide
laying
aside
their
armor
and
weapons
they
went
to
clonard
where
all
the
people
dreading
them
and
knowing
their
wickedness
fled
for
their
lives
except
the
saint
himself
who
came
forward
to
meet
them
with
him
the
three
brothers
undertook
the
most
austere
religious
exercises
and
after
a
year
they
came
to
finnen
and
asked
his
punishment
for
their
former
crimes
you
can
not
he
said
restore
to
life
those
you
have
slain
but
you
can
at
least
restore
the
buildings
you
have
devastated
and
ruined
so
they
went
and
repaired
many
churches
after
which
they
resolved
to
go
on
a
pilgrimage
upon
the
great
atlantic
ocean
they
built
for
themselves
therefore
a
curragh
or
coracle
covered
with
hides
three
deep
it
was
capable
of
carrying
nine
persons
and
they
selected
five
out
of
the
many
who
wished
to
join
the
party
there
were
a
bishop
a
priest
a
deacon
a
musician
and
the
man
who
had
modelled
the
boat
and
with
these
they
pushed
out
to
sea
it
had
happened
some
years
before
that
in
a
quarrel
about
a
deer
hunt
the
men
of
ross
had
killed
the
king
it
had
been
decided
that
by
way
of
punishment
sixty
couples
of
the
people
of
ross
should
be
sent
out
to
sea
two
and
two
in
small
boats
to
meet
what
fate
they
might
upon
the
deeps
they
were
watched
that
they
might
not
land
again
and
for
many
years
nothing
more
had
been
heard
from
them
the
most
pious
task
which
these
repenting
pilgrims
could
undertake
it
was
thought
would
be
to
seek
these
banished
people
they
resolved
to
spread
their
sail
and
let
providence
direct
their
course
they
went
therefore
northwest
on
the
atlantic
where
they
visited
several
wonderful
islands
on
one
of
which
there
was
a
great
bird
which
related
to
them
the
legend
says
the
whole
history
of
the
world
and
gave
them
a
great
leaf
from
a
tree
the
leaf
being
as
large
as
an
and
being
preserved
for
many
years
in
one
of
the
churches
after
their
return
at
the
next
island
they
heard
sweet
human
voices
and
found
that
the
sixty
banished
couples
had
established
their
homes
there
the
pilgrims
then
went
onward
in
their
hidebound
boat
until
they
reached
the
coast
of
spain
and
there
they
landed
and
dwelt
for
a
time
the
bishop
built
a
church
and
the
priest
officiated
in
it
and
the
organist
took
charge
of
the
music
all
prospered
yet
the
and
the
three
brothers
were
never
quite
contented
for
they
had
roamed
the
seas
too
long
and
they
longed
for
a
new
enterprise
for
their
idle
valor
they
thought
they
had
found
this
when
one
day
they
found
on
the
a
group
of
women
tearing
their
hair
and
when
they
asked
the
explanation
señor
said
an
old
woman
our
sons
and
our
husbands
have
again
fallen
into
the
hand
of
satan
at
this
the
three
brothers
were
startled
for
they
remembered
well
how
they
used
in
youth
to
rank
themselves
as
satan
children
asking
farther
they
learned
that
a
shattered
boat
they
saw
on
the
beach
was
one
of
a
pair
of
boats
which
had
been
carried
too
far
out
to
sea
and
had
come
near
an
islet
which
the
sailors
called
de
la
man
or
the
island
of
satan
hand
it
appeared
that
in
that
region
there
was
an
islet
so
called
always
surrounded
by
chilly
mists
and
water
of
a
deadly
cold
that
no
one
had
ever
reached
it
as
it
constantly
changed
place
but
that
a
demon
hand
sometimes
uprose
from
it
and
plucked
away
men
and
even
whole
boats
which
when
once
grasped
usually
by
night
were
never
seen
again
but
perished
helplessly
victims
of
satan
hand
when
the
voyagers
laughed
at
this
legend
the
priest
of
the
village
showed
them
on
the
early
chart
of
bianco
the
name
of
de
la
man
satanagio
and
on
that
of
beccaria
the
name
satanagio
alone
both
these
being
the
titles
of
islands
not
alarmed
at
the
name
of
satan
as
being
that
of
one
whom
they
had
supposed
in
their
days
of
darkness
to
be
their
patron
they
pushed
boldly
out
to
sea
and
steered
westward
a
of
spanish
fishermen
following
in
their
wake
passing
island
after
island
of
green
and
fertile
look
they
found
themselves
at
last
in
what
seemed
a
less
favored
zone
as
windy
as
the
roaring
forties
and
growing
chillier
every
hour
fogs
gathered
quickly
so
that
they
could
scarcely
see
the
companion
boat
and
the
spanish
fishermen
called
out
to
them
garda
da
la
man
do
satanaxio
look
out
for
satan
hand
as
they
cried
the
fog
became
denser
yet
and
when
it
once
parted
for
a
moment
something
that
lifted
itself
high
above
them
like
a
gigantic
hand
showed
itself
an
instant
and
then
descended
with
a
crushing
grasp
upon
the
boat
of
the
spanish
fishermen
breaking
it
to
pieces
and
dragging
some
of
the
men
below
the
water
while
others
escaping
swam
through
the
waves
and
were
with
difficulty
taken
on
board
the
coracle
this
being
all
the
harder
because
the
whole
surface
of
the
water
was
boiling
and
seething
furiously
rowing
away
as
they
could
from
this
perilous
neighborhood
they
lay
on
their
oars
when
the
night
came
on
not
knowing
which
way
to
go
gradually
the
fog
cleared
away
the
sun
rose
clearly
at
last
and
wherever
they
looked
on
the
deep
they
saw
no
traces
of
any
island
still
less
of
the
demon
hand
but
for
the
presence
among
them
of
the
fishermen
they
had
picked
up
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
any
casualty
had
happened
that
day
they
steered
still
farther
to
the
west
with
some
repining
from
the
crew
and
at
night
the
same
fog
gathered
the
same
deadly
chill
came
on
finding
themselves
in
shoal
water
and
apparently
near
some
island
they
decided
to
anchor
the
boat
and
as
the
man
in
the
bow
bent
over
to
clear
away
the
anchor
something
came
down
upon
him
with
the
same
awful
force
and
knocked
him
overboard
his
body
could
not
be
recovered
and
as
the
wind
came
up
they
drove
before
it
until
noon
of
the
next
day
seeing
nothing
of
any
land
and
the
ocean
deepening
again
by
noon
the
fog
cleared
and
they
saw
nothing
but
cried
with
one
voice
that
the
boat
should
be
put
about
and
they
should
return
to
spain
for
two
days
they
rowed
in
peace
over
a
summer
sea
then
came
the
fog
again
and
they
laid
on
their
oars
that
night
all
around
them
dim
islands
seemed
to
float
scarcely
discernible
in
the
fog
sometimes
from
the
top
of
each
a
point
would
show
itself
as
of
a
mighty
hand
and
they
could
hear
an
occasional
plash
and
roar
as
if
this
hand
came
downwards
once
they
heard
a
cry
as
if
of
sailors
from
another
vessel
then
they
strained
their
eyes
to
gaze
into
the
fog
and
a
whole
island
seemed
to
be
turning
itself
upside
down
its
peak
coming
down
while
its
base
went
uppermost
and
the
whole
water
boiled
for
leagues
around
as
if
both
earth
and
sea
were
upheaved
the
sun
rose
upon
this
chaos
of
waters
no
demon
hand
was
anywhere
visible
nor
any
island
but
a
few
icebergs
were
in
sight
and
the
frightened
sailors
rowed
away
and
made
sail
for
home
it
was
rare
to
see
icebergs
so
far
south
and
this
naturally
added
to
the
general
dismay
amid
the
superstition
of
the
sailors
the
tales
grew
and
grew
and
all
the
terrors
became
mingled
but
tradition
says
that
there
were
some
veteran
spanish
sailors
along
that
coast
men
who
had
sailed
on
longer
voyages
and
that
these
persons
actually
laughed
at
the
whole
story
of
hand
saying
that
any
one
who
had
happened
to
see
an
iceberg
topple
over
would
know
all
about
it
it
was
more
generally
believed
however
that
all
this
was
mere
envy
and
jealousy
the
daring
fishermen
remained
heroes
for
the
rest
of
their
days
and
it
was
only
within
a
century
or
two
that
the
island
of
satanaxio
disappeared
from
the
charts
xv
antillia
the
island
of
the
seven
cities
the
young
spanish
page
luis
de
vega
had
been
for
some
months
at
the
court
of
don
rodrigo
king
of
spain
when
he
heard
the
old
knights
lamenting
as
they
came
out
of
the
palace
at
toledo
over
the
king
last
and
most
daring
whim
he
means
said
one
of
them
in
a
whisper
to
penetrate
the
secret
cave
of
the
gothic
kings
that
cave
on
which
each
successive
sovereign
has
put
a
padlock
till
there
are
now
of
them
interrupted
a
still
older
knight
and
he
means
said
the
first
frowning
at
the
interruption
to
take
thence
the
treasures
of
his
ancestors
indeed
he
must
do
it
said
another
else
the
son
of
his
ancestors
will
have
no
treasure
left
of
his
own
but
there
is
a
spell
upon
it
said
the
other
for
ages
spain
has
been
threatened
with
invasion
and
it
is
the
old
tradition
that
the
only
talisman
which
can
prevent
it
is
in
this
cave
well
said
the
scoffer
it
is
only
by
entering
the
cave
that
he
can
possess
the
talisman
but
if
he
penetrates
to
it
his
power
is
lost
a
pretty
talisman
said
the
other
it
is
only
of
use
to
anybody
so
long
as
no
one
sees
it
were
i
the
king
i
would
hold
it
in
my
hands
and
i
have
counselled
him
to
heed
no
graybeards
but
to
seize
the
treasure
for
himself
i
have
offered
to
accompany
him
may
it
please
your
lordship
said
the
eager
luis
may
i
go
with
you
yes
said
don
alonzo
de
carregas
turning
to
the
ardent
boy
where
the
king
goes
i
go
and
where
i
go
thou
shalt
be
my
companion
see
señors
he
said
turning
to
the
others
how
the
ready
faith
of
boyhood
puts
your
fears
to
shame
to
his
majesty
the
terrors
of
this
goblin
cave
are
but
a
jest
which
frightens
the
old
and
only
rouses
the
young
to
courage
the
king
may
find
the
recesses
of
the
cavern
filled
with
gold
and
jewels
he
who
goes
with
him
may
share
them
this
boy
is
my
first
recruit
who
follows
by
this
time
a
whole
group
of
courtiers
young
and
old
had
assembled
about
don
alonzo
and
every
man
below
thirty
years
was
ready
to
pledge
himself
to
the
enterprise
but
the
older
courtiers
and
the
archbishop
oppas
were
beseeching
the
king
to
refrain
respect
o
king
they
said
the
custom
held
sacred
by
of
thy
predecessors
give
us
but
an
estimate
of
the
sum
that
may
in
thy
kingly
mind
represent
the
wealth
that
is
within
the
cavern
walls
and
we
will
raise
it
on
our
own
domains
rather
than
see
the
sacred
tradition
set
at
nought
the
king
only
answer
was
follow
me
don
alonzo
hastily
sending
the
boy
luis
to
collect
the
younger
knights
who
had
already
pledged
themselves
to
the
enterprise
a
gallant
troop
they
made
their
way
down
the
steep
steps
which
led
from
the
palace
to
the
cave
the
news
had
spread
the
ladies
had
gathered
on
the
balconies
and
the
bright
face
of
one
laughing
girl
looked
from
a
bower
window
while
she
tossed
a
rose
to
the
happy
luis
alas
it
fell
short
of
its
mark
and
hit
the
robes
of
archbishop
oppas
who
stood
with
frowning
face
as
the
youngster
swept
by
the
archbishop
crushed
it
unwittingly
in
the
hand
that
held
the
crosier
the
rusty
padlocks
were
broken
and
each
fell
clanking
on
the
floor
and
was
brushed
away
by
mailed
heels
they
passed
from
room
to
room
with
torches
for
the
cavern
extended
far
beneath
the
earth
yet
they
found
no
treasure
save
the
jewelled
table
of
solomon
but
for
their
great
expectations
this
table
alone
might
have
proved
sufficient
to
reward
their
act
of
daring
some
believed
that
it
had
been
brought
by
the
romans
from
solomon
temple
and
from
rome
by
the
goths
and
vandals
who
sacked
that
city
and
afterwards
conquered
spain
but
all
believed
it
to
be
sacred
and
now
saw
it
to
be
gorgeous
some
describe
it
as
being
of
gold
set
with
precious
stones
others
as
of
gold
and
silver
making
it
yellow
and
white
in
hue
ornamented
with
a
row
of
pearls
a
row
of
rubies
and
another
row
of
emeralds
it
is
generally
agreed
that
it
stood
on
three
hundred
and
sixty
feet
each
made
of
a
single
emerald
being
what
it
was
the
king
did
not
venture
to
remove
it
but
left
it
where
it
was
traversing
chamber
after
chamber
and
finding
all
empty
they
at
last
found
all
passages
leading
to
the
inmost
apartment
which
had
a
marble
urn
in
the
centre
yet
all
eyes
presently
turned
from
this
urn
to
a
large
painting
on
the
wall
which
displayed
a
troop
of
horsemen
in
full
motion
their
horses
were
of
arab
breed
their
arms
were
scimitars
and
lances
with
fluttering
pennons
they
wore
turbans
and
their
coarse
black
hair
fell
over
their
shoulders
they
were
dressed
in
skins
never
had
there
been
seen
by
the
courtiers
a
mounted
troop
so
wild
so
eager
so
formidable
turning
from
them
to
the
marble
urn
the
king
drew
from
it
a
parchment
which
said
these
are
the
people
who
whenever
this
cave
is
entered
and
the
spell
contained
in
this
urn
is
broken
shall
possess
this
country
an
idle
curiosity
has
done
its
work

the
rash
king
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hands
fled
outward
from
the
cavern
his
knights
followed
him
but
don
alonzo
lingered
last
except
the

nevertheless
my
lord
said
luis
i
should
like
to
strike
a
blow
at
these
bold
barbarians
we
may
have
an
opportunity
said
the
gloomy
knight
he
closed
the
centre
gate
of
the
cavern
and
tried
to
replace
the
broken
padlocks
but
it
was
in
vain
in
hours
the
story
had
travelled
over
the
kingdom
the
boy
luis
little
knew
into
what
a
complex
plot
he
was
drifting
in
the
secret
soul
of
his
protector
don
alonzo
there
burned
a
great
anger
against
the
weak
and
licentious
king
he
and
his
father
count
julian
and
archbishop
oppas
his
uncle
were
secretly
brooding
plans
of
wrath
against
don
rodrigo
for
his
ill
treatment
of
don
alonzo
sister
florinda
rumors
had
told
them
that
an
army
of
strange
warriors
from
africa
who
had
hitherto
carried
all
before
them
were
threatening
to
cross
the
straits
not
yet
called
gibraltar
and
descend
on
spain
all
the
ties
of
fidelity
held
these
courtiers
to
the
king
but
they
secretly
hated
him
and
wished
for
his
downfall
by
the
next
day
they
had
planned
to
betray
him
to
the
moors
count
julian
had
come
to
make
his
military
report
to
don
rodrigo
and
on
some
pretext
had
withdrawn
florinda
from
the
court
when
you
come
again
said
the
king
bring
me
some
hawks
from
the
south
that
we
may
again
go
hawking
i
will
bring
you
hawks
enough
was
the
answer
and
such
as
you
never
saw
before
but
rodrigo
says
the
arabian
chronicler
did
not
understand
the
full
meaning
of
his
words
it
was
a
hard
blow
for
the
young
luis
when
he
discovered
what
a
plot
was
being
urged
around
him
he
would
gladly
have
been
faithful
to
the
king
worthless
as
he
knew
him
to
be
but
don
alonzo
had
been
his
benefactor
and
he
held
by
him
meanwhile
the
conspiracy
drew
towards
completion
and
the
arab
force
was
drawing
nearer
to
the
straits
a
single
foray
into
spain
had
shown
musa
the
arab
general
the
weakness
of
the
kingdom
that
the
cities
were
unfortified
the
citizens
unarmed
and
many
of
the
nobles
lukewarm
towards
the
king
hasten
he
said
towards
that
country
where
the
palaces
are
filled
with
gold
and
silver
and
the
men
can
not
fight
in
their
defence
accordingly
in
the
early
spring
of
the
year
musa
sent
his
next
in
command
tarik
to
cross
to
spain
with
an
army
of
seven
thousand
men
consisting
mostly
of
chosen
cavalry
they
crossed
the
straits
then
called
the
sea
of
narrowness
embarking
the
troops
at
tangier
and
ceute
in
many
merchant
vessels
and
landing
at
that
famous
promontory
called
thenceforth
by
the
arab
general
name
the
rock
of
tarik
or
more
briefly
gibraltar
luis
under
don
alonzo
was
with
the
spanish
troops
sent
hastily
down
to
resist
the
arab
invaders
and
as
these
troops
were
mounted
he
had
many
opportunities
of
seeing
the
new
enemies
and
observing
their
ways
they
were
a
picturesque
horde
their
breasts
were
covered
with
mail
armor
they
wore
white
turbans
on
their
heads
carried
their
bows
slung
across
their
backs
and
their
swords
suspended
to
their
girdles
while
they
held
their
long
spears
firmly
grasped
in
their
hands
the
arabs
said
that
their
fashion
of
mail
armor
had
come
to
them
from
king
david
to
whom
they
said
god
made
iron
soft
and
it
became
in
his
hands
as
thread
more
than
half
of
them
were
mounted
on
the
swift
horses
which
were
peculiar
to
their
people
and
the
white
red
and
black
turbans
and
cloaks
made
a
most
striking
picture
around
the
these
men
too
were
already
trained
and
successful
soldiers
held
together
both
by
a
common
religion
and
by
the
hope
of
spoil
there
were
twelve
thousand
of
them
by
the
most
probable
estimate
for
musa
had
sent
reinforcements
and
they
had
against
them
from
five
to
eight
times
their
number
but
of
the
spaniards
only
a
small
part
were
armed
or
drilled
or
used
to
warfare
and
great
multitudes
of
them
had
to
put
their
reliance
in
clubs
slings
axes
and
short
scythes
the
cavalry
were
on
the
wings
where
luis
found
himself
with
count
julian
and
archbishop
oppas
to
command
them
soon
however
don
alonzo
and
luis
were
detached
with
others
to
act
as
escort
to
the
king
don
rodrigo
the
battle
began
soon
after
daybreak
on
sunday
july
as
the
spanish
troops
advanced
their
trumpets
sounded
defiance
and
were
answered
by
moorish
horns
and
kettledrums
while
they
drew
near
the
shouts
of
the
spaniards
were
drowned
in
the
of
the
arabs
the
phrase
there
is
no
deity
but
god
as
they
came
nearer
yet
there
is
a
tradition
that
rodrigo
looking
on
the
moslem
said
by
the
faith
of
the
messiah
these
are
the
very
men
i
saw
painted
on
the
walls
of
the
cave
at
toledo
yet
he
certainly
bore
himself
like
a
king
and
he
rode
on
the
in
a
chariot
of
ivory
lined
with
gold
having
a
silken
awning
decked
with
pearls
and
rubies
while
the
vehicle
was
drawn
by
three
white
mules
abreast
he
was
then
nearly
eighty
and
was
dressed
in
a
silken
robe
embroidered
with
pearls
he
had
brought
with
him
in
carts
and
on
mules
his
treasures
in
jewels
and
money
and
he
had
trains
of
mules
whose
only
load
consisted
of
ropes
to
bind
the
arms
of
his
captives
so
sure
was
he
of
making
every
arab
his
prisoner
driving
along
the
lines
he
addressed
his
troops
boldly
and
arriving
at
the
centre
quitted
his
chariot
put
on
a
horned
helmet
and
mounted
his
white
horse
orelio
this
was
before
the
invention
of
gunpowder
and
all
battles
were
hand
to
hand
on
the
first
day
the
result
was
doubtful
and
tarik
rode
through
the
arab
ranks
calling
on
them
to
fight
for
their
religion
and
their
safety
as
the
onset
began
tarik
rode
furiously
at
a
spanish
chief
whom
he
took
for
the
king
and
struck
him
down
for
a
moment
it
was
believed
to
be
the
king
whom
he
had
killed
and
from
that
moment
new
energy
was
given
to
the
arabs
the
line
of
the
spaniards
wavered
and
at
this
moment
the
whole
wing
of
cavalry
to
which
luis
belonged
rode
out
from
its
place
and
passed
on
the
flank
of
the
army
avoiding
both
spaniard
and
arab
what
means
this
said
luis
to
the
horseman
by
his
side
it
means
was
the
answer
that
bishop
oppas
is
betraying
the
king
at
this
moment
don
alonzo
rode
up
and
cheered
their
march
with
explanations
no
more
he
said
will
we
obey
this
imbecile
old
king
who
can
neither
fight
nor
govern
he
and
his
troops
are
but
so
many
old
women
it
is
only
these
arabs
who
are
men
all
is
arranged
with
tarik
and
we
will
save
our
country
by
joining
the
only
man
who
can
govern
it
luis
groaned
in
dismay
it
seemed
to
him
an
act
of
despicable
treachery
but
those
around
him
seemed
mostly
prepared
for
it
and
he
said
to
himself
after
all
don
alonzo
is
my
chief
i
must
hold
by
him
so
he
kept
with
the
others
and
the
whole
cavalry
wing
followed
oppas
to
a
knoll
whence
they
watched
the
fight
it
soon
became
a
panic
the
arabs
carried
all
before
them
and
the
king
himself
was
either
killed
or
hid
himself
in
a
convent
many
a
spaniard
of
the
seceding
wing
of
cavalry
reproached
himself
afterwards
for
what
had
been
done
and
while
the
archbishop
had
some
influence
with
the
conquering
general
and
persuaded
him
to
allow
the
christians
everywhere
to
retain
a
part
of
their
churches
yet
he
had
after
all
the
reward
of
a
traitor
in
contempt
and
this
he
could
bear
no
longer
and
organizing
an
expedition
from
a
spanish
port
he
and
six
minor
bishops
with
many
families
of
the
christians
made
their
way
towards
gibraltar
they
did
not
make
their
escape
however
without
attracting
notice
and
obstruction
as
they
rode
among
the
hills
with
their
long
train
soldiers
ecclesiastics
women
and
children
they
saw
a
galloping
band
of
arabs
in
pursuit
the
archbishop
bade
them
turn
instantly
into
a
deserted
castle
they
were
just
passing
to
drop
the
portcullis
and
man
the
walls
that
they
might
look
as
numerous
as
possible
he
bade
all
the
women
dress
themselves
like
men
and
tie
their
long
hair
beneath
their
chins
to
resemble
beards
he
then
put
helmets
on
their
heads
and
lances
in
their
hands
and
thus
the
arab
leader
saw
a
formidable
host
on
the
walls
to
be
besieged
in
obedience
perhaps
to
orders
he
rode
away
and
after
sufficient
time
had
passed
the
archbishop
party
rode
onward
towards
their
place
of
embarkation
luis
found
himself
beside
a
maiden
who
ambled
along
on
a
white
mule
and
when
he
ventured
to
joke
her
a
little
on
her
late
appearance
as
an
armed
cavalier
she
said
coyly
did
you
think
my
only
weapons
were
roses
looking
eagerly
at
her
he
recognized
the
laughing
face
which
he
had
once
seen
at
a
window
but
ere
he
could
speak
again
she
had
struck
her
mule
lightly
and
taken
refuge
beside
the
archbishop
where
luis
dared
not
venture
he
did
not
recognize
the
maiden
again
till
they
met
on
board
one
of
the
vessels
which
the
arabs
had
left
at
gibraltar
and
on
which
they
embarked
for
certain
islands
of
which
oppas
had
heard
which
lay
in
the
sea
of
darkness
among
these
islands
they
were
to
find
their
future
home
the
voyage
at
first
rough
soon
became
serene
and
quiet
the
skies
were
clear
the
moon
shone
the
veils
of
the
spanish
maidens
were
convenient
by
day
and
useless
at
evening
and
luis
had
many
a
talk
on
the
with
juanita
who
proved
to
be
a
young
relative
of
the
archbishop
it
was
understood
that
she
was
to
take
the
veil
and
that
young
as
she
was
she
would
become
by
and
by
the
lady
abbess
of
a
nunnery
to
be
established
on
the
islands
and
as
her
kinsman
though
severe
to
others
was
gentle
to
her
she
had
her
own
way
a
good
deal
especially
beneath
the
moon
and
the
stars
for
the
rest
they
had
daily
services
of
religion
as
dignified
and
sonorous
as
could
have
taken
place
on
shore
except
on
those
rare
occasions
when
the
chief
bass
voice
was
hushed
in
seasickness
in
some
cabin
below
beautiful
gregorian
masses
rose
to
heaven
and
it
is
certain
that
the
pilgrim
fathers
in
their
two
months
on
the
atlantic
almost
a
thousand
years
later
had
no
such
rich
melody
as
floated
across
those
summer
seas
luis
was
a
favorite
of
oppas
the
archbishop
who
never
seemed
to
recognize
any
danger
in
having
an
enamoured
youth
so
near
to
the
demure
future
abbess
he
consulted
the
youth
about
many
plans
their
aim
it
seemed
was
the
great
island
called
antillia
as
yet
unexplored
but
reputed
to
be
large
enough
for
many
thousand
people
oppas
was
to
organize
the
chief
settlement
and
he
planned
to
divide
the
island
into
seven
dioceses
each
bishop
having
a
permanent
colony
once
established
they
would
trade
with
spain
and
whether
it
remained
moorish
or
became
christian
oppas
was
sure
of
friendly
relations
the
priests
were
divided
among
the
three
vessels
and
among
them
there
was
that
occasional
jarring
from
which
even
holy
men
are
not
quite
free
the
different
bishops
had
their
partisans
but
none
dared
openly
face
the
imperial
oppas
his
supposed
favorite
luis
was
less
formidable
he
was
watched
and
spied
upon
while
his
devotion
to
the
dignified
juanita
was
apparent
to
all
yet
he
was
always
ready
to
leave
her
side
when
oppas
called
and
then
they
discussed
together
the
future
prospects
of
the
party
when
they
should
see
land
whether
it
would
really
be
antillia
whether
they
should
have
a
good
landfall
whether
the
island
would
be
fertile
whether
there
would
be
native
inhabitants
and
if
so
whether
they
should
be
baptized
and
sent
to
spain
as
slaves
or
whether
they
should
be
retained
on
the
island
it
was
decided
on
the
whole
that
this
last
should
be
done
and
what
with
the
prospect
of
winning
souls
and
the
certainty
of
having
obedient
subjects
the
prospect
seemed
inviting
one
morning
at
sunrise
there
lay
before
them
a
tropic
island
soft
and
graceful
with
green
shrubs
and
cocoanut
trees
and
rising
in
the
distance
to
mountains
whose
scooped
tops
and
dark
furrowed
sides
spoke
of
extinct
volcanoes
yet
not
so
extinct
but
that
a
faint
wreath
of
vapor
still
mounted
from
the
utmost
peak
of
the
highest
among
them
here
and
there
were
seen
huts
covered
with
great
leaves
or
sheaves
of
grass
and
among
these
they
saw
figures
moving
and
disappearing
watching
their
approach
yet
always
ready
to
disappear
in
the
recesses
of
the
woods
sounding
carefully
the
depth
of
water
with
their
imperfect
tackle
they
anchored
off
the
main
beach
and
sent
a
boat
on
shore
from
each
vessel
luis
being
in
command
of
one
the
natives
at
first
hovered
in
the
distance
but
presently
came
down
to
the
shore
to
meet
the
visitors
some
even
swimming
off
to
the
boats
in
advance
they
were
of
a
yellow
complexion
with
good
features
were
naked
except
for
or
woven
palm
fibres
or
reeds
painted
in
different
colors
and
were
gay
and
merry
singing
and
dancing
among
themselves
when
brought
on
board
the
ships
they
ate
bread
and
figs
but
refused
wine
and
spices
and
they
seemed
not
to
know
the
use
of
rings
or
of
swords
when
shown
to
them
whatever
was
given
to
them
they
divided
with
one
another
they
cultivated
fruit
and
grain
on
their
island
reared
goats
and
seemed
willing
to
share
all
with
their
newly
found
friends
luis
always
thoughtful
and
somewhat
anxious
in
temperament
felt
many
doubts
as
to
the
usage
which
these
peaceful
islanders
would
receive
from
the
ships
company
no
matter
how
many
bishops
and
holy
men
might
be
on
board
all
that
day
there
was
exploring
by
small
companies
and
on
the
next
the
archbishop
landed
in
solemn
procession
the
boats
from
the
ships
all
met
at
early
morning
near
the
shore
the
sight
bringing
together
a
crowd
of
islanders
on
the
banks
men
women
and
children
who
with
an
instinct
that
something
of
importance
was
to
happen
decked
themselves
with
flowers
wreaths
and
plumes
the
number
increasing
constantly
and
the
crowd
growing
more
and
more
picturesque
forming
from
the
boats
a
procession
marched
slowly
up
the
beach
beginning
with
a
few
lay
brethren
carrying
tools
for
digging
then
acolytes
bearing
tall
crosses
and
then
priests
the
seven
bishops
being
carried
on
litters
the
archbishop
most
conspicuously
of
all
solemn
chants
were
sung
as
the
procession
moved
through
the
calm
water
towards
the
placid
shore
and
the
gentle
savages
joined
in
kneeling
while
a
solemn
mass
was
said
and
the
crosses
were
uplifted
which
took
possession
of
the
land
in
the
name
of
the
church
these
solemn
services
occupied
much
of
the
day
later
they
carried
tents
on
shore
and
some
of
them
occupied
large
storehouses
which
the
natives
had
built
for
drying
their
figs
and
to
the
women
under
direction
of
juanita
was
allotted
a
great
airy
cave
with
smaller
caves
branching
from
it
where
the
natives
had
made
palm
baskets
day
after
day
they
labored
transferring
all
their
goods
and
provisions
to
the
land
tools
and
horses
and
mules
clothing
and
simple
furniture
most
of
them
joined
with
pleasure
in
this
toil
but
others
grew
restless
as
they
transferred
all
their
possessions
to
land
and
sometimes
the
women
especially
would
climb
to
high
places
and
gaze
longingly
towards
spain
one
morning
a
surprise
came
to
luis
every
night
it
was
their
custom
to
have
a
great
fire
on
the
beach
and
to
meet
and
sing
chants
around
it
one
night
luis
had
personally
put
out
the
blaze
of
the
fire
as
it
was
more
windy
than
usual
and
went
to
sleep
in
his
tent
soon
after
midnight
he
was
awakened
by
a
glare
of
a
great
light
upon
his
tent
thin
walls
and
hastily
springing
up
he
saw
their
largest
caravel
on
fire
rushing
out
to
give
the
alarm
he
saw
a
similar
flame
kindled
in
the
second
vessel
and
then
after
some
delay
in
the
third
then
he
saw
a
dark
boat
pulling
hastily
towards
the
shore
and
going
down
to
the
beach
he
met
their
most
trusty
captain
who
told
him
that
the
ships
had
been
burnt
by
order
of
the
archbishop
in
order
that
their
return
might
be
hopeless
and
that
their
stay
on
the
island
might
be
forever
there
was
some
lamentation
among
the
emigrants
when
they
saw
their
retreat
thus
cut
off
but
luis
when
once
established
on
shore
did
not
share
it
to
be
near
juanita
was
enough
for
him
though
he
rarely
saw
her
he
began
sometimes
to
feel
that
the
full
confidence
of
the
archbishop
was
withdrawn
from
him
but
he
was
still
high
in
office
and
he
rode
with
oppas
over
the
great
island
marking
it
out
by
slow
degrees
into
seven
divisions
that
each
bishop
might
have
a
diocese
and
a
city
of
his
own
soon
the
foundations
began
to
be
laid
and
houses
and
churches
began
to
be
built
for
the
soft
volcanic
rock
was
easily
worked
though
not
very
solid
for
building
the
spot
for
the
cathedral
was
selected
with
the
unerring
eye
for
a
fine
situation
which
the
roman
catholic
church
has
always
shown
and
the
adjoining
convent
claimed
as
it
rose
the
care
of
juanita
as
general
superintendent
of
the
works
it
was
the
duty
of
luis
sometimes
to
be
in
that
neighborhood
until
one
unlucky
day
when
the
two
lovers
lingering
to
watch
the
full
moon
rise
were
interrupted
by
one
of
the
younger
bishops
a
spaniard
of
stealthy
ways
who
had
before
now
taken
it
upon
himself
to
watch
them
nothing
could
be
more
innocent
than
their
dawning
loves
yet
how
could
any
love
be
held
innocent
on
the
part
of
a
maiden
who
was
the
kinswoman
of
an
archbishop
and
was
his
destined
choice
for
the
duties
of
an
abbess
the
fact
that
she
had
never
yet
taken
her
preliminary
vows
or
given
her
consent
to
take
them
counted
for
nothing
in
the
situation
though
any
experienced
could
have
told
the
archbishop
that
no
maiden
could
be
wisely
made
an
abbess
until
she
had
given
some
signs
of
having
a
vocation
for
a
religious
life
from
that
moment
the
youthful
pair
met
no
more
for
weeks
it
seemed
always
necessary
for
luis
to
be
occupied
elsewhere
than
in
the
cathedral
city
as
the
best
architect
on
the
island
he
was
sent
here
there
and
everywhere
and
the
six
other
churches
rose
with
more
rapidity
because
the
archbishop
preferred
to
look
after
his
own
the
once
peaceful
natives
found
themselves
a
shade
less
happy
when
they
were
required
to
work
all
day
long
as
or
as
builders
but
it
was
something
had
they
but
known
it
that
they
were
not
borne
away
as
slaves
as
happened
later
on
other
islands
to
so
many
of
their
race
to
luis
they
were
always
loyal
for
his
cheery
ways
although
there
seemed
a
change
in
his
spirits
as
time
went
on
but
an
event
happened
which
brought
a
greater
change
still
a
spanish
caravel
was
seen
one
day
making
towards
the
port
and
showing
signals
of
distress
luis
having
just
then
found
an
excuse
for
visiting
the
cathedral
city
was
the
first
to
board
her
and
was
hailed
with
joy
by
the
captain
he
was
a
townsman
of
the
youth
and
had
given
him
his
first
lessons
in
navigation
he
had
been
bound
it
seemed
for
the
canary
islands
and
had
put
in
for
repairs
which
needed
only
a
few
days
in
the
quiet
waters
of
a
sheltered
port
he
could
tell
luis
of
his
parents
of
his
home
and
that
the
northern
part
of
spain
under
arab
sway
was
humanely
governed
and
a
certain
proportion
of
christian
churches
allowed
in
a
few
days
the
caravel
sailed
again
at
nightfall
but
it
carried
with
it
two
unexpected
passengers
the
archbishop
lost
his
architect
and
the
proposed
convent
lost
its
unwilling
abbess
from
this
point
both
the
island
of
the
seven
cities
and
its
escaping
lovers
disappear
from
all
definite
records
it
was
a
period
when
expeditions
of
discovery
came
and
went
and
when
one
wondrous
tale
drove
out
another
there
exist
legends
along
the
northern
coast
of
spain
in
the
region
of
santander
for
instance
of
a
youth
who
once
eloped
with
a
maiden
and
came
there
to
dwell
but
there
may
have
been
many
such
youths
and
many
such
maidens
who
knows
of
antillia
itself
or
the
island
of
the
seven
cities
it
is
well
known
that
it
appeared
on
the
maps
of
the
atlantic
sometimes
under
the
one
name
and
sometimes
under
another
six
hundred
years
after
the
date
assigned
by
the
story
that
has
here
been
told
it
was
said
by
fernando
columbus
to
have
been
revisited
by
a
portuguese
sailor
in
and
the
name
appeared
on
the
globe
of
behaim
in
the
geographer
toscanelli
in
his
famous
letter
to
columbus
recommended
antillia
as
likely
to
be
useful
to
columbus
as
a
way
station
for
reaching
india
and
when
the
great
explorer
reached
hispaniola
he
was
supposed
to
have
discovered
the
mysterious
island
whence
the
name
of
antilles
was
given
to
the
group
later
the
first
explorers
of
new
mexico
thought
that
the
pueblos
were
the
seven
cities
so
that
both
the
names
of
the
imaginary
island
have
been
preserved
although
those
of
luis
de
vega
and
his
faithful
juanita
have
not
been
recorded
until
the
telling
of
this
tale
xvi
harald
the
viking
erik
the
red
the
most
famous
of
all
vikings
had
three
sons
and
once
when
they
were
children
the
king
came
to
visit
erik
and
passed
through
the
playground
where
the
boys
were
playing
leif
and
biorn
the
two
oldest
were
building
little
houses
and
barns
and
were
making
believe
that
they
were
full
of
cattle
and
sheep
while
harald
who
was
only
four
years
old
was
sailing
chips
of
wood
in
a
pool
the
king
asked
harald
what
they
were
and
he
said
ships
of
war
king
olaf
laughed
and
said
the
time
may
come
when
you
will
command
ships
my
little
friend
then
he
asked
biorn
what
he
would
like
best
to
have
he
said
ten
farms
that
would
yield
much
corn
the
king
replied
then
he
asked
leif
the
same
question
and
he
answered
cows
how
many
so
many
that
when
they
went
to
the
lake
to
be
watered
they
would
stand
close
round
the
edge
so
that
not
another
could
pass
that
would
be
a
large
housekeeping
said
the
king
and
he
asked
the
same
question
of
harald
what
would
you
like
best
to
have
servants
and
followers
said
the
child
stoutly
how
many
would
you
like
enough
said
the
child
to
eat
up
all
the
cows
and
crops
of
my
brothers
at
a
single
meal
then
the
king
laughed
and
said
to
the
mother
of
the
children
you
are
bringing
up
a
king
as
the
boys
grew
leif
and
harald
were
ever
fond
of
roaming
while
biorn
wished
to
live
on
the
farm
at
peace
their
sister
freydis
went
with
the
older
boys
and
urged
them
on
she
was
not
gentle
and
amiable
but
full
of
energy
and
courage
she
was
also
quarrelsome
and
vindictive
people
said
of
her
that
even
if
her
brothers
were
all
killed
yet
the
race
of
erik
the
red
would
not
end
while
she
lived
that
she
practised
more
of
shooting
and
the
handling
of
sword
and
shield
than
of
sewing
or
embroidering
and
that
as
she
was
able
she
did
evil
oftener
than
good
and
that
when
she
was
hindered
she
ran
into
the
woods
and
slew
men
to
get
their
property
she
was
always
urging
her
brothers
to
deeds
of
daring
and
adventure
one
day
they
had
been
hawking
and
when
they
let
slip
the
falcons
falcon
killed
two
blackcocks
in
one
flight
and
three
in
another
the
dogs
ran
and
brought
the
birds
and
he
said
proudly
to
the
others
it
will
be
long
before
most
of
you
have
any
such
success
and
they
all
agreed
to
this
he
rode
home
in
high
spirits
and
showed
his
birds
to
his
sister
freydis
did
any
king
he
asked
ever
make
so
great
a
capture
in
so
short
a
time
it
is
indeed
she
said
a
good
morning
hunting
to
have
got
five
blackcocks
but
it
was
still
better
when
in
one
morning
a
king
of
norway
took
five
kings
and
subdued
all
their
kingdoms
then
harald
went
away
very
humble
and
besought
his
father
to
let
him
go
and
serve
on
the
varangian
guard
of
king
otho
at
constantinople
that
he
might
learn
to
be
a
warrior
so
harald
was
brought
from
his
norwegian
home
by
his
father
erik
the
red
in
his
galley
called
the
and
sailed
with
him
through
the
mediterranean
sea
and
was
at
last
made
a
member
of
the
emperor
varangian
guard
at
constantinople
this
guard
will
be
well
remembered
by
the
readers
of
scott
novel
count
robert
of
paris
and
was
maintained
by
successive
emperors
and
drawn
largely
from
the
scandinavian
races
erik
the
red
had
no
hesitation
in
leaving
his
son
among
them
as
the
young
man
was
stout
and
strong
very
and
quite
able
to
defend
himself
the
father
knew
also
that
the
varangian
guard
though
hated
by
the
people
held
to
one
another
like
a
band
of
brothers
and
that
any
one
brought
up
among
them
would
be
sure
of
plenty
of
fighting
and
plenty
of
gold
the
two
things
most
prized
by
early
norsemen
for
ordinary
life
chief
duties
would
be
to
lounge
about
the
palace
keeping
guard
wearing
helmet
and
buckler
and
bearskin
with
purple
underclothes
and
golden
clasped
hose
and
bearing
as
armor
a
mighty
and
a
small
scimitar
such
was
the
life
led
by
harald
till
one
day
he
had
a
message
from
his
father
through
a
new
recruit
calling
him
home
to
join
an
expedition
to
the
western
seas
i
hear
my
son
the
message
said
that
your
good
emperor
whom
may
the
gods
preserve
is
sorely
ill
and
may
die
any
day
when
he
is
dead
be
prompt
in
getting
your
share
of
the
plunder
of
the
palace
and
come
back
to
me
the
emperor
died
and
the
order
was
fulfilled
it
was
the
custom
of
the
varangians
to
reward
themselves
in
this
way
for
their
faithful
services
of
protection
and
the
result
is
that
to
this
day
greek
and
arabic
gold
crosses
and
chains
are
to
be
found
in
the
houses
of
norwegian
peasants
and
may
be
seen
in
the
museums
of
christiania
and
copenhagen
no
one
was
esteemed
the
less
for
this
love
of
spoil
if
he
was
only
generous
in
giving
the
norsemen
spoke
contemptuously
of
gold
as
the
serpent
bed
and
called
a
generous
man
a
hater
of
the
serpent
bed
because
such
a
man
parts
with
gold
as
with
a
thing
he
hates
when
the
youth
came
to
his
father
he
found
erik
the
red
directing
the
building
of
one
of
the
great
norse
galleys
nearly
eighty
feet
long
and
seventeen
wide
and
only
six
feet
deep
the
boat
had
twenty
ribs
and
the
frame
was
fastened
together
by
withes
made
of
roots
while
the
oaken
planks
were
held
by
iron
rivets
the
oars
were
twenty
feet
long
and
were
put
through
oar
holes
and
the
rudder
shaped
like
a
large
oar
was
not
at
the
end
but
was
attached
to
a
projecting
beam
on
the
starboard
originally
side
the
ship
was
to
be
called
a
dragon
and
was
to
be
painted
so
as
to
look
like
one
having
a
gilded
dragon
head
at
the
bow
and
a
gilded
tail
on
the
stern
while
the
moving
oars
would
look
like
legs
and
the
row
of
red
and
white
shields
hung
along
the
side
of
the
boat
would
resemble
the
scales
of
a
dragon
and
the
great
square
sails
red
and
blue
would
look
like
wings
this
was
the
vessel
which
young
harald
was
to
command
he
had
already
made
trips
in
just
such
vessels
with
his
father
had
learned
to
attack
the
enemy
with
arrow
and
spear
also
with
stones
thrown
down
from
above
and
with
to
clutch
opposing
boats
he
had
learned
to
swim
from
early
childhood
even
in
the
icy
northern
waters
and
he
had
been
trained
in
swimming
to
hide
his
head
beneath
his
floating
shield
so
that
it
could
not
be
seen
he
had
learned
also
to
carry
tinder
in
a
walnut
shell
enclosed
in
wax
so
that
no
matter
how
long
he
had
been
in
the
water
he
could
strike
a
light
on
reaching
shore
he
had
also
learned
from
his
father
acts
of
escape
as
well
as
attack
thus
he
had
once
sailed
on
a
return
trip
from
denmark
after
plundering
a
town
the
ships
had
been
lying
at
anchor
all
night
in
a
fog
and
at
sunlight
in
the
morning
lights
seemed
burning
on
the
sea
but
erik
the
red
said
it
is
a
fleet
of
danish
ships
and
the
sun
strikes
on
the
gilded
dragon
crests
furl
the
sail
and
take
to
the
oars
they
rowed
their
best
yet
the
danish
ships
were
overtaking
them
when
erik
the
red
ordered
his
men
to
throw
wood
overboard
and
cover
it
with
danish
plunder
this
made
some
delay
as
the
danes
stopped
to
pick
it
up
and
in
the
same
way
erik
the
red
dropped
his
provisions
and
finally
his
prisoners
and
in
the
delay
thus
caused
he
got
away
with
his
own
men
but
now
harald
was
not
to
go
to
denmark
but
to
the
new
western
world
the
wonderstrands
which
leif
had
sought
and
had
left
without
sufficient
exploration
first
however
he
was
to
call
at
greenland
which
his
father
had
first
discovered
it
was
the
custom
of
the
viking
explorers
when
they
reached
a
new
country
to
throw
overboard
their
seat
posts
or
the
curved
part
of
their
doorways
and
then
to
land
where
they
floated
ashore
but
erik
the
red
had
lent
his
to
a
friend
and
could
not
get
them
back
so
that
he
sailed
in
search
of
them
and
came
to
a
new
land
which
he
called
greenland
because
as
he
said
people
would
be
attracted
thither
if
it
had
a
good
name
then
he
established
a
colony
there
and
then
leif
the
lucky
as
he
was
called
sailed
still
farther
and
came
to
the
wonderstrand
or
magic
shores
these
he
called
vinland
or
and
now
a
rich
man
named
karlsefne
was
to
send
a
colony
thither
from
greenland
and
the
young
harald
was
to
go
with
it
and
take
command
of
it
now
as
harald
was
to
be
presented
to
the
rich
karlsefne
he
thought
he
must
be
gorgeously
arrayed
so
he
wore
a
helmet
on
his
head
a
red
shield
richly
inlaid
with
gold
and
iron
and
a
sharp
sword
with
an
ivory
handle
wound
with
golden
thread
he
had
also
a
short
spear
and
wore
over
his
coat
a
red
silk
short
cloak
on
which
was
embroidered
both
before
and
behind
a
yellow
lion
we
may
well
believe
that
the
sixty
men
and
five
women
who
composed
the
expedition
were
ready
to
look
on
him
with
admiration
especially
as
one
of
the
women
was
his
own
sister
freydis
now
left
to
his
peculiar
care
since
erik
the
red
had
died
the
sturdy
old
hero
had
died
still
a
heathen
and
it
was
only
just
after
his
death
that
christianity
was
introduced
into
greenland
and
those
numerous
churches
were
built
there
whose
ruins
yet
remain
even
in
regions
from
which
all
population
has
gone
so
the
party
of
colonists
sailed
for
vinland
and
freydis
with
the
four
older
women
came
in
harald
boat
and
freydis
took
easily
the
lead
among
them
for
strength
though
not
always
it
must
be
admitted
for
amiability
the
boats
of
the
expedition
having
left
greenland
soon
after
the
year
coasted
the
shore
as
far
as
they
could
rarely
venturing
into
open
sea
at
last
amidst
fog
and
chilly
weather
they
made
land
at
a
point
where
a
river
ran
through
a
lake
into
the
sea
and
they
could
not
enter
from
the
sea
except
at
high
tide
it
was
once
believed
that
this
was
narragansett
bay
in
rhode
island
but
this
is
no
longer
believed
here
they
landed
and
called
the
place
hóp
from
the
icelandic
word
meaning
an
inlet
from
the
ocean
here
they
found
growing
and
fields
of
wild
wheat
there
were
fish
in
the
lake
and
wild
animals
in
the
woods
here
they
landed
the
cattle
and
the
provisions
which
they
had
brought
with
them
and
here
they
built
their
huts
they
went
in
the
spring
and
during
that
summer
the
natives
came
in
boats
of
skin
to
trade
with
them
men
described
as
black
and
ill
favored
with
large
eyes
and
broad
cheeks
and
with
coarse
hair
on
their
heads
these
it
is
thought
may
have
been
the
esquimaux
the
first
time
they
came
these
visitors
held
up
a
white
shield
as
a
sign
of
peace
and
were
so
frightened
by
the
bellowing
of
the
bull
that
they
ran
away
then
returning
they
brought
furs
to
sell
and
wished
to
buy
weapons
but
harald
tried
another
plan
he
bade
the
women
bring
out
milk
butter
and
cheese
from
their
dairies
and
when
the
skraelings
saw
that
they
wished
for
nothing
else
and
the
legend
says
the
skraelings
carried
away
their
wares
in
their
stomachs
but
the
norsemen
had
the
skins
they
had
purchased
this
happened
yet
again
but
at
the
second
visit
one
of
the
skraelings
was
accidentally
killed
or
injured
the
next
time
the
skraelings
came
they
were
armed
with
slings
and
raised
upon
a
pole
a
great
blue
ball
and
attacked
the
norsemen
so
furiously
that
they
were
running
away
when
erik
sister
freydis
came
out
before
them
with
bare
arms
and
took
up
a
sword
saying
why
do
you
run
strong
men
as
you
are
from
these
miserable
dwarfs
whom
i
thought
you
would
knock
down
like
cattle
give
me
weapons
and
i
will
fight
better
than
any
of
you
then
the
rest
took
courage
and
began
to
fight
and
the
skraelings
were
driven
back
once
more
the
strangers
came
and
one
of
them
took
up
an
axe
a
thing
which
he
had
not
before
seen
and
struck
at
one
of
his
companions
killing
him
then
the
leader
took
the
axe
and
threw
it
into
the
water
after
which
the
skraelings
retreated
and
were
not
seen
again
the
winter
was
a
mild
one
and
while
it
lasted
the
norsemen
worked
busily
at
felling
wood
and
they
had
also
many
amusements
in
most
of
which
harald
excelled
they
used
to
swim
in
all
weathers
one
of
their
feats
was
to
catch
seals
and
sit
on
them
while
swimming
another
was
to
pull
one
another
down
and
remain
as
long
as
possible
under
water
harald
could
swim
for
a
mile
or
more
with
his
armor
on
or
with
a
companion
on
his
shoulder
they
used
to
play
the
tug
of
war
dragging
each
other
by
a
walrus
hide
across
the
fire
harald
was
good
at
this
and
was
also
the
best
archer
sometimes
aiming
at
something
placed
on
a
boy
head
the
boy
having
a
cloth
tied
around
his
head
and
held
by
two
men
that
he
might
not
move
at
all
on
hearing
the
whistling
of
the
arrow
in
this
way
harald
could
even
shoot
an
arrow
under
a
nut
placed
on
the
head
so
that
the
nut
would
roll
down
and
the
head
not
be
hurt
he
could
plant
a
spear
in
the
ground
and
then
shoot
an
arrow
upward
so
skilfully
that
it
would
turn
in
the
air
and
fall
with
the
point
in
the
end
of
the
he
could
also
shoot
a
blunt
arrow
through
the
thickest
from
a
he
could
change
weapons
from
one
hand
to
the
other
during
a
fencing
match
or
fence
with
either
hand
or
throw
two
spears
at
the
same
time
or
catch
a
spear
in
motion
he
could
run
so
fast
that
no
horse
could
overtake
him
and
play
the
rough
games
with
bat
and
ball
using
a
ball
of
the
hardest
wood
he
could
race
on
snowshoes
or
wrestle
when
bound
by
a
belt
to
his
antagonist
then
when
he
and
his
companions
wished
a
rest
they
amused
themselves
with
or
riddles
or
chess
the
norsemen
even
played
chess
on
board
their
vessels
and
there
are
still
to
be
seen
on
some
of
these
the
little
holes
that
were
formerly
used
for
the
sharp
ends
of
the
chessmen
so
that
they
should
not
be
displaced
they
could
not
find
that
any
european
had
ever
visited
this
place
but
some
of
the
skraelings
told
them
of
a
place
farther
south
which
they
called
the
land
of
the
whiteman
or
great
ireland
they
said
that
in
that
place
there
were
white
men
who
clothed
themselves
in
long
white
garments
carried
before
them
poles
to
which
white
cloths
were
hung
and
called
with
a
loud
voice
these
it
was
thought
by
the
norsemen
must
be
christian
processions
in
which
banners
were
borne
and
hymns
were
chanted
it
has
been
thought
from
this
that
some
expedition
from
ireland
that
of
brandan
for
instance
may
have
left
a
settlement
there
long
before
but
this
has
never
been
confirmed
the
skraelings
and
the
northmen
were
good
friends
for
a
time
until
at
last
one
of
erik
own
warriors
killed
a
skraeling
by
accident
and
then
all
harmony
was
at
an
end
they
saw
no
hope
of
making
a
lasting
settlement
there
and
moreover
freydis
who
was
very
grasping
tried
to
deceive
the
other
settlers
and
get
more
than
her
share
of
everything
so
that
harald
himself
lost
patience
with
her
and
threatened
her
it
happened
that
one
of
the
men
of
the
party
olaf
was
harald
they
had
once
had
a
fight
and
after
the
battle
had
agreed
that
they
would
be
friends
for
life
and
always
share
the
same
danger
for
this
vow
they
were
to
walk
under
the
turf
that
is
a
strip
of
turf
was
cut
and
held
above
their
heads
and
they
stood
beneath
and
let
their
blood
flow
upon
the
ground
whence
the
turf
had
been
cut
after
this
they
were
to
own
everything
by
halves
and
either
must
avenge
the
other
death
this
was
their
brotherhood
but
freydis
did
not
like
it
so
she
threatened
olaf
and
tried
to
induce
men
to
kill
him
for
she
did
not
wish
to
bring
upon
herself
the
revenge
that
must
come
if
she
slew
him
this
was
the
reason
why
the
whole
enterprise
failed
and
why
olaf
persuaded
harald
for
the
sake
of
peace
to
return
to
greenland
in
the
spring
and
take
a
load
of
valuable
timber
to
sell
there
including
one
stick
of
what
was
called
which
was
as
valuable
as
mahogany
and
may
have
been
at
some
time
borne
by
ocean
currents
to
the
beach
it
is
hardly
possible
that
as
some
have
thought
the
colonists
established
a
regular
trade
in
this
wood
for
no
such
wood
grows
on
the
northern
atlantic
shores
however
this
may
be
the
party
soon
returned
after
one
winter
in
vinland
the
good
and
on
the
way
back
harald
did
one
thing
which
made
him
especially
dear
to
his
men
a
favorite
feat
of
the
norsemen
was
to
toss
three
swords
in
the
air
and
catch
each
by
the
handle
as
it
came
down
this
was
called
the
game
the
young
men
used
also
to
try
the
feat
of
running
along
the
of
the
rowers
as
they
were
in
motion
passing
around
the
bow
of
the
vessel
with
a
spring
and
coming
round
to
the
stern
over
the
oars
on
the
other
side
few
could
accomplish
this
but
no
one
but
harald
could
do
it
and
play
the
game
as
he
ran
and
when
he
did
it
they
all
said
that
he
was
the
most
skilful
man
at
ever
seen
that
was
their
word
for
an
athletic
feat
but
presently
came
a
time
when
not
only
his
courage
but
his
fairness
and
justice
were
to
be
tried
it
happened
in
this
way
there
was
nothing
of
which
the
norsemen
were
more
afraid
than
of
the
or
shipworm
which
gnaws
the
wood
of
ships
it
was
observed
in
greenland
and
iceland
that
pieces
of
wood
often
floated
on
shore
which
were
filled
with
holes
made
by
this
animal
and
they
thought
that
in
certain
places
the
seas
were
full
of
this
worm
so
that
a
ship
would
be
bored
and
sunk
in
a
little
while
it
is
said
that
on
this
return
voyage
harald
vessel
entered
a
and
presently
began
to
sink
they
had
however
provided
a
smaller
boat
smeared
with
which
the
worms
would
not
attack
they
went
into
the
boat
but
found
that
it
would
not
hold
more
than
half
of
them
all
then
harald
said
we
will
divide
by
lots
without
regard
to
the
rank
each
taking
his
chance
with
the
rest
this
they
thought
the
norse
legend
says
a
offer
they
drew
lots
and
harald
was
among
those
assigned
to
the
safer
boat
he
stepped
in
and
when
he
was
there
a
man
called
from
the
other
boat
and
said
dost
thou
intend
harald
to
separate
from
me
here
harald
answered
so
it
turns
out
and
the
man
said
very
different
was
thy
promise
to
my
father
when
we
came
from
greenland
for
the
promise
was
that
we
should
share
the
same
fate
then
harald
said
it
shall
not
be
thus
go
into
the
boat
and
i
will
go
back
into
the
ship
since
thou
art
so
anxious
to
live
then
harald
went
back
to
the
ship
while
the
man
took
his
place
in
the
boat
and
after
that
harald
was
never
heard
of
more
xvii
the
search
for
norumbega
sir
humphrey
gilbert
colonel
of
the
british
forces
in
the
netherlands
was
poring
over
the
manuscript
narrative
of
david
ingram
mariner
ingram
had
in
taken
the
widest
range
of
travel
that
had
ever
been
taken
in
the
new
continent
of
which
it
was
still
held
doubtful
by
many
whether
it
was
or
was
not
a
part
of
asia
surely
gilbert
said
to
his
walter
raleigh
a
youth
of
this
knave
hath
seen
strange
things
he
hath
been
set
ashore
by
john
hawkins
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
there
left
behind
he
hath
travelled
northward
with
two
of
his
companions
along
indian
trails
he
hath
even
reached
norumbega
he
hath
seen
that
famous
city
with
its
houses
of
crystal
and
silver
pine
logs
and
hemlock
bark
belike
said
raleigh
scornfully
nay
said
gilbert
he
hath
carefully
written
it
down
he
saw
kings
decorated
with
rubies
six
inches
long
and
they
were
borne
on
chairs
of
silver
and
crystal
adorned
with
precious
stones
he
saw
pearls
as
common
as
pebbles
and
the
natives
were
laden
down
by
their
ornaments
of
gold
and
silver
the
city
of
bega
was
of
a
mile
long
and
had
many
streets
wider
than
those
of
london
some
houses
had
massive
pillars
of
crystal
and
silver
what
assurance
can
he
give
asked
raleigh
he
offers
on
his
life
to
prove
it
a
small
offer
mayhap
there
be
many
of
these
lying
mariners
whose
lives
are
as
worthless
as
the
stories
they
relate
but
what
said
he
of
the
natives
kindly
disposed
was
the
reply
so
far
as
he
went
but
those
dwelling
farther
north
where
he
did
not
go
were
said
to
be
cannibals
with
teeth
like
those
of
dogs
whereby
you
may
know
them
travellers
tales
said
raleigh
ignotum
pro
he
returned
said
gilbert
disregarding
the
interruption
in
the
a
french
vessel
commanded
by
captain
champagne
methinks
something
of
the
flavor
represented
by
the
good
captain
name
hath
got
into
your
englishman
brain
good
ale
never
gives
such
fantasies
doth
he
perchance
speak
of
elephants
he
doth
said
sir
humphrey
hesitatingly
perchance
he
saw
them
not
but
heard
of
them
only
what
says
he
of
them
asked
raleigh
he
says
that
he
saw
in
that
country
both
elephants
and
ounces
and
he
says
that
their
trumpets
are
made
of
elephants
teeth
but
the
houses
said
raleigh
tell
me
of
the
houses
in
every
house
said
gilbert
reading
from
the
manuscript
they
have
scoops
buckets
and
divers
vessels
all
of
massive
silver
with
which
they
throw
out
water
and
otherwise
employ
them
the
women
wear
great
plates
of
gold
covering
their
bodies
and
chains
of
great
pearls
in
the
manner
of
curvettes
and
the
men
wear
manilions
or
bracelets
on
each
arm
and
each
leg
some
of
gold
and
some
of
silver
whence
come
they
these
gauds
there
are
great
rivers
where
one
may
find
pieces
of
gold
as
big
as
the
fist
and
there
are
great
rocks
of
crystal
sufficient
to
load
many
ships
this
was
all
which
was
said
on
that
day
but
never
was
explorer
more
eager
than
gilbert
he
wrote
a
discourse
of
a
discoverie
for
a
new
passage
to
cathaia
and
the
east
indies
published
without
his
knowledge
by
george
gascoigne
in
he
had
from
queen
elizabeth
a
patent
of
exploration
allowing
him
to
take
possession
of
any
uncolonized
lands
in
north
america
paying
for
these
a
fifth
of
all
gold
and
silver
found
the
next
year
he
sailed
with
raleigh
for
newfoundland
but
one
vessel
was
lost
and
the
others
returned
to
england
in
he
sailed
again
taking
with
him
the
narrative
of
ingram
which
he
reprinted
he
also
took
with
him
a
learned
hungarian
from
buda
named
parmenius
who
went
for
the
express
purpose
of
singing
the
praise
of
norumbega
in
latin
verse
but
was
drowned
in
sir
humphrey
great
the
this
wreck
took
place
near
sable
island
and
as
most
of
the
supplies
for
the
expedition
went
down
in
the
the
men
in
the
remaining
vessels
grew
so
impatient
as
to
compel
a
return
there
were
two
vessels
the
of
forty
tons
and
the
of
ten
tons
this
last
being
a
mere
boat
then
called
a
frigate
a
small
vessel
propelled
by
both
sails
and
oars
quite
unlike
the
afterwards
called
by
that
name
on
both
these
vessels
the
men
were
so
distressed
that
they
gathered
on
the
bulwarks
pointing
to
their
empty
mouths
and
their
ragged
clothing
the
officers
of
the
were
unwilling
to
return
but
consented
on
sir
humphrey
promise
that
they
should
come
back
in
the
spring
they
sailed
for
england
on
the
of
august
all
wished
him
to
return
in
the
as
a
much
larger
and
safer
vessel
the
besides
its
smallness
being
encumbered
on
the
deck
with
guns
ammunition
and
nettings
making
it
unseaworthy
but
when
he
was
begged
to
remove
into
the
larger
vessel
he
said
i
will
not
forsake
my
little
company
going
homeward
with
whom
i
have
passed
so
many
storms
and
perils
one
reason
for
this
was
the
narrator
of
the
voyage
says
because
of
hard
reports
given
of
him
that
he
was
afraid
of
the
sea
albeit
this
was
rather
rashness
than
advised
resolution
to
prefer
the
wind
of
a
vain
report
to
the
weight
of
his
own
life
on
the
very
day
of
sailing
they
caught
their
first
glimpse
of
some
large
species
of
seal
or
walrus
which
is
thus
described
by
the
old
narrator
of
the
expedition
so
vpon
saturday
in
the
afternoone
the
of
august
we
changed
our
course
and
returned
backe
for
england
at
which
very
instant
euen
in
winding
about
there
passed
along
betweene
vs
and
towards
the
land
which
we
now
forsooke
a
very
lion
to
our
seeming
in
shape
hair
and
colour
not
swimming
after
the
maner
of
a
beast
by
moouing
of
his
feete
but
rather
sliding
vpon
the
water
with
his
whole
body
excepting
the
legs
in
sight
neither
yet
in
diuing
vnder
and
againe
rising
aboue
the
water
as
the
maner
is
of
whales
dolphins
tunise
porposes
and
all
other
fish
but
confidently
shewing
himselfe
aboue
water
without
hiding
notwithstanding
we
presented
our
selues
in
open
view
and
gesture
to
amase
him
as
all
creatures
will
be
commonly
at
a
sudden
gaze
and
sight
of
men
thus
he
passed
along
turning
his
head
to
and
fro
yawning
and
gaping
wide
with
ougly
demonstration
of
long
teeth
and
glaring
eies
and
to
bidde
vs
a
farewell
comming
right
against
the
hinde
he
sent
forth
a
horrible
voyce
roaring
or
bellowing
as
doeth
a
lion
which
spectacle
wee
all
beheld
so
farre
as
we
were
able
to
discerne
the
same
as
men
prone
to
wonder
at
euery
strange
thing
as
this
doubtlesse
was
to
see
a
lion
in
the
ocean
sea
or
fish
in
shape
of
a
lion
what
opinion
others
had
thereof
and
chiefly
the
generall
himselfe
i
forbeare
to
deliuer
but
he
tooke
it
for
bonum
omen
a
good
omen
reioycing
that
he
was
to
warre
against
such
an
enemie
if
it
were
the
deuill
when
they
came
north
of
the
azores
very
violent
storms
met
them
most
outrageous
seas
the
narrator
says
and
they
saw
little
lights
upon
the
mainyard
called
then
by
sailors
castor
and
pollux
and
now
fire
yet
they
had
but
one
of
these
at
a
time
and
this
is
thought
a
sign
of
tempest
on
september
in
the
afternoon
the
general
as
they
called
him
sir
humphrey
was
sitting
abaft
with
a
book
in
his
hand
and
cried
out
more
than
once
to
those
in
the
other
vessel
we
are
as
near
to
heaven
by
sea
as
by
land
and
that
same
night
about
twelve
the
frigate
being
ahead
of
the
the
lights
of
the
smaller
vessel
suddenly
disappeared
and
they
knew
that
she
had
sunk
in
the
sea
the
event
is
well
described
in
a
ballad
by
longfellow
the
name
of
norumbega
and
the
tradition
of
its
glories
survived
sir
humphrey
gilbert
in
a
french
map
of
the
town
appears
with
castle
and
towers
jean
allfonsce
who
visited
new
england
in
that
year
describes
it
as
the
capital
of
a
great
fur
country
students
of
indian
tongues
defined
the
word
as
meaning
the
place
of
a
fine
city
while
the
learned
grotius
seized
upon
it
as
being
the
same
as
norberga
and
so
affording
a
relic
of
the
visits
of
the
northmen
as
to
the
locality
it
appeared
first
on
the
maps
as
a
large
island
then
as
a
smaller
one
and
after
no
longer
as
an
island
but
a
part
of
the
mainland
bordering
apparently
on
the
penobscot
river
whittier
in
his
poem
of
norumbega
describes
a
norman
knight
as
seeking
it
in
vain
he
turned
him
back
master
dear
we
are
but
men
misled
and
thou
hast
sought
a
city
here
to
find
a
grave
instead
builded
wonder
of
these
lands
my
weary
eyes
shall
see
a
city
never
made
with
hands
alone
awaiteth
me
so
champlain
in
could
find
no
trace
of
it
and
said
that
no
such
marvel
existed
while
mark
lescarbot
the
parisian
advocate
writing
in
says
if
this
beautiful
town
ever
existed
in
nature
i
would
like
to
know
who
pulled
it
down
for
there
is
nothing
here
but
huts
made
of
pickets
and
covered
with
the
barks
of
trees
or
skins
yet
it
kept
its
place
on
maps
till
and
even
heylin
in
his
cosmography
speaks
of
norumbega
and
its
fair
city
though
he
fears
that
the
latter
never
existed
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
the
late
justin
winsor
the
eminent
historian
after
much
inquiry
among
the
present
descendants
of
the
indian
tribes
in
maine
could
never
find
any
one
who
could
remember
to
have
heard
the
name
of
norumbega
xviii
the
guardians
of
the
lawrence
when
in
the
sieur
de
champlain
went
back
to
france
to
report
his
wonderful
explorations
in
canada
he
was
soon
followed
by
a
young
frenchman
named
vignan
who
had
spent
a
whole
winter
among
the
indians
in
a
village
where
there
was
no
other
white
man
this
was
a
method
often
adopted
by
the
french
for
getting
more
knowledge
of
indian
ways
and
commanding
their
confidence
vignan
had
made
himself
a
welcome
guest
in
the
cabins
and
had
brought
away
many
of
their
legends
to
which
he
added
some
of
his
own
in
particular
he
declared
that
he
had
penetrated
into
the
interior
until
he
had
come
upon
a
great
lake
of
salt
water
far
to
the
northwest
this
was
as
it
happened
the
very
thing
which
the
french
government
and
all
europe
had
most
hoped
to
find
they
had
always
believed
that
sooner
or
later
a
short
cut
would
be
discovered
across
the
newly
found
continent
a
passage
leading
to
the
pacific
ocean
and
far
cathay
this
was
the
dream
of
all
french
explorers
and
of
champlain
in
particular
and
his
interest
was
at
once
excited
by
anything
that
looked
toward
the
pacific
now
vignan
had
prepared
himself
with
just
the
needed
information
he
said
that
during
his
winter
with
the
indians
he
had
made
the
very
discovery
needed
that
he
had
ascended
the
river
ottawa
which
led
to
a
body
of
salt
water
so
large
that
it
seemed
like
an
ocean
that
he
had
just
seen
on
its
shores
the
wreck
of
an
english
ship
from
which
eighty
men
had
been
taken
and
slain
by
the
savages
and
that
they
had
with
them
an
english
boy
whom
they
were
keeping
to
present
to
champlain
this
tale
about
the
english
ship
was
evidently
founded
on
the
recent
calamities
of
henry
hudson
of
which
vignan
had
heard
some
garbled
account
and
which
he
used
as
coloring
for
his
story
the
result
was
that
champlain
was
thoroughly
interested
in
the
tale
and
that
vignan
was
and
tested
and
was
made
at
last
to
certify
to
the
truth
of
it
before
two
notaries
of
rochelle
champlain
privately
consulted
the
chancellor
de
sillery
the
old
marquis
de
brissac
and
others
who
all
assured
him
that
the
matter
should
be
followed
up
and
he
resolved
to
make
it
the
subject
of
an
exploration
without
delay
he
sailed
in
one
vessel
and
vignan
in
another
the
latter
taking
with
him
an
ardent
young
frenchman
albert
de
brissac
de
vignan
talking
with
the
young
brissac
on
the
voyage
told
him
wonderful
tales
of
monsters
which
were
he
said
the
guardians
of
the
lawrence
river
there
was
he
said
an
island
in
the
bay
of
chaleurs
near
the
mouth
of
that
river
where
a
creature
dwelt
having
the
form
of
a
woman
and
called
by
the
indians
gougou
she
was
very
frightful
and
so
enormous
that
the
masts
of
the
vessel
could
not
reach
her
waist
she
had
already
eaten
many
savages
and
constantly
continued
to
do
so
putting
them
first
into
a
great
pocket
to
await
her
hunger
some
of
those
who
had
escaped
said
that
this
pocket
was
large
enough
to
hold
a
whole
ship
this
creature
habitually
made
dreadful
noises
and
several
savages
who
came
on
board
claimed
to
have
heard
them
a
man
from
malo
in
france
the
sieur
de
prevert
confirmed
this
story
and
said
that
he
had
passed
so
near
the
den
of
this
frightful
being
that
all
on
board
could
hear
its
hissing
and
all
hid
themselves
below
lest
it
should
carry
them
off
this
naturally
made
much
impression
upon
the
young
sieur
de
brissac
and
he
doubtless
wished
many
times
that
he
had
stayed
at
home
on
the
other
hand
he
observed
that
both
de
vignan
and
de
prevert
took
the
tale
very
coolly
and
that
there
seemed
no
reason
why
he
should
distrust
himself
if
they
did
not
yet
he
was
very
glad
when
after
passing
many
islands
and
narrow
straits
the
river
broadened
and
they
found
themselves
fairly
in
the
lawrence
and
past
the
haunted
bay
of
chaleurs
they
certainly
heard
a
roaring
and
a
hissing
in
the
distance
but
it
may
have
been
the
waves
on
the
beach
but
this
was
not
their
last
glimpse
of
the
supposed
guardians
of
the
lawrence
as
the
ship
proceeded
farther
up
the
beautiful
river
they
saw
one
morning
a
boat
come
forth
from
the
woods
bearing
three
men
dressed
to
look
like
devils
wrapped
in
dogs
skins
white
and
black
their
faces
besmeared
as
black
as
any
coals
with
horns
on
their
heads
more
than
a
yard
long
and
as
this
boat
passed
the
ship
one
of
the
men
made
a
long
address
not
looking
towards
them
then
they
all
three
fell
flat
in
the
boat
when
indians
rowed
out
to
meet
them
and
guided
them
to
a
landing
then
many
indians
collected
in
the
woods
and
began
a
loud
talk
which
they
could
hear
on
board
the
ships
and
which
lasted
half
an
hour
then
two
of
their
leaders
came
towards
the
shore
holding
their
hands
upward
joined
together
and
meanwhile
carrying
their
hats
under
their
upper
garments
and
showing
great
reverence
looking
upward
they
sometimes
cried
jesus
jesus
or
jesus
maria
then
the
captain
asked
them
whether
anything
ill
had
happened
and
they
said
in
french
nenni
est
il
bon
meaning
that
it
was
not
good
then
they
said
that
their
god
cudraigny
had
spoken
in
hochelaga
montreal
and
had
sent
these
three
men
to
show
to
them
that
there
was
so
much
snow
and
ice
in
the
country
that
he
who
went
there
would
die
this
made
the
frenchmen
laugh
saying
in
reply
that
their
god
cudraigny
was
but
a
fool
and
a
noddy
and
knew
not
what
he
said
tell
him
said
a
frenchman
that
christ
will
defend
them
from
all
cold
if
they
will
believe
in
him
the
indians
then
asked
the
captain
if
he
had
spoken
with
jesus
he
answered
no
but
that
his
priests
had
and
they
had
promised
fair
weather
hearing
this
they
thanked
the
captain
and
told
the
other
indians
in
the
woods
who
all
came
rushing
out
seeming
to
be
very
glad
giving
great
shouts
they
began
to
sing
and
dance
as
they
had
done
before
they
also
began
to
bring
to
the
ships
great
stores
of
fish
and
of
bread
made
of
millet
casting
it
into
the
french
boats
so
thickly
that
it
seemed
to
fall
from
heaven
then
the
frenchmen
went
on
shore
and
the
people
came
clustering
about
them
bringing
children
in
their
arms
to
be
touched
as
if
to
hallow
them
then
the
captain
in
return
arranged
the
women
in
order
and
gave
them
beads
made
of
tin
and
other
trifles
and
gave
knives
to
the
men
all
that
night
the
indians
made
great
fires
and
danced
and
sang
along
the
shore
but
when
the
frenchmen
had
finally
reached
the
mouth
of
the
ottawa
and
had
begun
to
ascend
it
under
guidance
they
had
reasons
to
remember
the
threats
of
the
god
cudraigny
ascending
the
ottawa
in
canoes
past
cataracts
boulders
and
precipices
they
at
last
with
great
labor
reached
the
island
of
allumette
at
a
distance
of
two
hundred
and
miles
often
it
was
impossible
to
carry
their
canoes
past
waterfalls
because
the
forests
were
so
dense
so
that
they
had
to
drag
the
boats
by
ropes
wading
among
rocks
or
climbing
along
precipices
gradually
they
left
behind
them
their
armor
their
provisions
and
clothing
keeping
only
their
canoes
they
lived
on
fish
and
wild
fowl
and
were
sometimes
hours
without
food
champlain
himself
carried
three
french
arquebuses
or
short
guns
three
oars
his
cloak
and
many
smaller
articles
and
was
harassed
by
dense
clouds
of
mosquitoes
all
the
time
vignan
brissac
and
the
rest
were
almost
as
heavily
loaded
the
tribe
of
indians
whom
they
at
last
reached
had
chosen
the
spot
as
being
inaccessible
to
their
enemies
and
thought
that
the
newcomers
had
fallen
from
the
clouds
when
champlain
inquired
after
the
salt
sea
promised
by
vignan
he
learned
to
his
indignation
that
the
whole
tale
was
false
vignan
had
spent
a
winter
at
the
very
village
where
they
were
but
confessed
that
he
had
never
gone
a
league
further
north
the
indians
knew
of
no
such
sea
and
craved
permission
to
torture
and
kill
him
for
his
deceptions
they
called
him
loudly
a
liar
and
even
the
children
took
up
the
cry
and
jeered
at
him
they
said
do
you
not
see
that
he
meant
to
cause
your
death
give
him
to
us
and
we
promise
you
that
he
shall
not
lie
any
more
champlain
defended
him
from
their
attacks
bore
it
all
philosophically
and
the
young
brissac
went
back
to
france
having
given
up
hope
of
reaching
the
salt
sea
except
as
champlain
himself
coolly
said
in
imagination
the
guardians
of
the
lawrence
had
at
least
exerted
their
spell
to
the
extent
of
saying
thus
far
and
no
farther
vignan
never
admitted
that
he
had
invented
the
story
of
the
gougou
and
had
bribed
the
indians
who
acted
the
part
of
devils
and
perhaps
he
did
not
but
it
is
certain
that
neither
the
giantess
nor
the
god
cudraigny
has
ever
again
been
heard
from
xix
the
island
of
demons
those
american
travellers
who
linger
with
delight
among
the
narrow
lanes
and
picturesque
overhanging
roofs
of
honfleur
do
not
know
what
a
strange
tragedy
took
place
on
a
voyage
which
began
in
that
quaint
old
port
three
centuries
and
a
half
ago
when
in
the
breton
sailor
jacques
cartier
returned
from
his
early
explorations
of
the
lawrence
which
he
had
ascended
as
high
as
hochelaga
king
francis
sent
for
him
at
the
lofty
old
house
known
as
the
house
of
the
salamander
in
a
narrow
street
of
the
quaint
town
of
lisieux
it
now
seems
incredible
that
the
most
powerful
king
in
europe
should
have
dwelt
in
such
a
meagre
lane
yet
the
house
still
stands
there
as
a
witness
although
a
visitor
must
now
brush
away
the
rough
garments
and
fishermen
overalls
which
overhang
its
door
over
that
stairway
nevertheless
the
troubadours
pierre
ronsard
and
clement
marot
used
to
go
up
and
down
humming
their
lays
or
touching
their
viols
and
through
that
door
de
lorge
returned
in
glory
after
leaping
down
into
the
lions
den
to
rescue
his
lady
glove
the
house
still
derives
its
name
from
the
great
carved
image
of
a
reptile
which
stretches
down
its
outer
wall
from
garret
to
cellar
beside
the
doorway
in
that
house
the
great
king
deigned
to
meet
the
breton
sailor
who
had
set
up
along
the
lawrence
a
cross
bearing
the
arms
of
france
with
the
inscription
primus
dei
gratia
francorum
rex
and
had
followed
up
the
pious
act
by
kidnapping
the
king
donnacona
and
carrying
him
back
to
france
this
savage
potentate
was
himself
brought
to
lisieux
to
see
his
french
and
the
jovial
king
eagerly
convinced
decided
to
send
cartier
forth
again
to
explore
for
other
wonders
and
perhaps
bring
back
other
kingly
brethren
meanwhile
however
as
it
was
getting
to
be
an
affair
of
royalty
he
decided
to
send
also
a
gentleman
of
higher
grade
than
a
pilot
and
so
selected
jean
françois
de
la
roche
sieur
de
roberval
whom
he
commissioned
as
lieutenant
and
governor
of
canada
and
hochelaga
roberval
was
a
gentleman
of
credit
and
renown
in
picardy
and
was
sometimes
jocosely
called
by
francis
the
little
king
of
vimeu
he
was
commissioned
at
fontainebleau
and
proceeded
to
superintend
the
building
of
ships
at
malo
marguerite
roberval
his
and
niece
was
to
go
with
him
on
the
voyage
with
other
ladies
of
high
birth
and
also
with
the
widowed
madame
de
noailles
her
roberval
himself
remained
at
malo
to
superintend
the
building
of
the
ships
and
marguerite
and
her
would
sit
for
hours
in
a
beautiful
nook
by
the
shipyards
where
they
could
overlook
the
vessels
in
rapid
construction
or
else
watch
the
wondrous
swirl
of
the
tide
as
it
swept
in
and
out
leaving
the
harbor
bare
at
low
tide
but
with
eight
fathoms
of
water
when
the
tide
was
full
the
designer
of
the
ships
often
came
cap
in
hand
to
ask
or
answer
questions
one
of
those
frank
and
manly
french
fishermen
and
pilots
whom
the
french
novelists
describe
as
solide
or
such
as
victor
hugo
paints
in
his
les
travailleurs
de
la
mer
the
son
of
a
notary
etienne
gosselin
was
better
educated
than
most
of
the
young
noblemen
whom
marguerite
knew
and
only
his
passion
for
the
sea
and
for
nautical
construction
had
kept
him
a
shipbuilder
no
wonder
that
the
young
marguerite
who
had
led
the
sheltered
life
of
the
french
maiden
was
attracted
by
his
manly
look
his
open
face
his
merry
blue
eyes
and
curly
hair
there
was
about
her
a
tinge
of
romance
which
made
her
heart
an
easier
thing
to
reach
for
such
a
lover
than
for
one
within
her
own
grade
and
as
the
voyage
itself
was
a
world
of
romance
a
little
more
or
less
of
the
romantic
was
an
easy
thing
to
add
meanwhile
madame
de
noailles
read
her
breviary
and
told
her
beads
and
took
little
naps
wholly
ignorant
of
the
drama
that
was
beginning
its
perilous
unfolding
before
her
when
the
sieur
de
roberval
returned
the
shipbuilder
became
a
mere
shipbuilder
again
three
tall
ships
sailed
from
honfleur
on
august
and
on
one
of
them
grande
so
called
to
distinguish
it
from
a
smaller
boat
of
that
name
which
had
previously
sailed
with
cartier
were
the
sieur
de
roberval
his
niece
and
her
she
also
had
with
her
a
huguenot
nurse
who
had
been
with
her
from
a
child
and
cared
for
her
devotedly
roberval
naturally
took
with
him
for
future
needs
the
best
shipbuilder
of
malo
etienne
gosselin
the
voyage
was
long
and
there
is
reason
to
think
that
the
sieur
de
roberval
was
not
a
good
sailor
while
as
to
the
she
may
have
been
as
helpless
as
the
seasick
chaperon
of
yachting
excursions
like
them
she
suffered
the
most
important
events
to
pass
unobserved
and
it
was
not
till
too
late
that
she
discovered
what
more
censorious
old
ladies
on
board
had
already
seen
that
her
young
charge
lingered
too
often
and
too
long
on
the
when
etienne
gosselin
was
planning
ships
for
the
uncle
when
she
found
it
out
she
was
roused
to
just
indignation
but
being
after
all
but
a
kindly
dowager
with
a
heart
softened
by
much
reading
of
the
interminable
tales
of
madame
de
scudéry
she
only
remonstrated
with
marguerite
wept
over
her
little
romance
and
threatened
to
break
the
sad
news
to
the
sieur
de
roberval
yet
never
did
so
other
ladies
were
less
considerate
it
all
broke
suddenly
upon
the
angry
uncle
the
youth
was
put
in
irons
and
threatened
with
flogging
and
forbidden
to
approach
the
again
but
love
laughs
at
locksmiths
gosselin
was
relieved
of
his
irons
in
a
day
or
two
because
he
could
not
be
spared
from
his
work
in
designing
the
forthcoming
ship
and
as
both
he
and
marguerite
were
of
a
tolerably
determined
nature
they
invoked
through
the
old
nurse
the
aid
of
a
huguenot
minister
on
board
who
had
before
sailed
with
cartier
to
take
charge
of
the
souls
of
some
protestant
vagabonds
on
the
ship
and
who
was
now
making
a
second
trip
for
the
same
reason
that
night
after
dark
he
joined
the
lovers
in
marriage
within
hours
roberval
had
heard
of
it
and
had
vowed
a
vengeance
quick
and
sure
the
next
morning
under
his
orders
the
vessel
lay
to
under
the
lee
of
a
rocky
island
then
known
to
the
sailors
as
des
demons
from
the
fierce
winds
that
raged
round
it
there
was
no
house
there
no
living
person
no
tradition
of
any
only
rocks
sands
and
deep
forests
with
dismay
the
ship
company
heard
that
it
was
the
firm
purpose
of
roberval
to
put
the
offending
bride
on
shore
giving
her
only
the
old
nurse
for
company
and
there
to
leave
her
with
provisions
for
three
months
trusting
to
some
other
vessel
to
take
the
exiled
women
away
within
that
time
the
very
ladies
whose
love
of
scandal
had
first
revealed
to
him
the
alleged
familiarities
now
besought
him
with
many
tears
to
abandon
the
thought
of
a
doom
so
terrible
vainly
madame
de
noailles
implored
mercy
for
the
young
girl
from
a
penalty
such
as
was
never
imposed
in
any
of
madame
de
scudéry
romances
vainly
the
huguenot
minister
and
the
catholic
chaplain
who
had
fought
steadily
on
questions
of
doctrine
during
the
whole
voyage
now
united
in
appeals
for
pardon
at
least
they
implored
him
to
let
the
offenders
have
a
or
two
with
them
to
protect
them
against
wild
beasts
or
buccaneers
he
utterly
refused
until
at
last
wearied
out
his
wild
nature
yielded
to
one
of
those
sudden
impulses
which
were
wont
to
sweep
over
it
and
he
exclaimed
is
it
that
they
need
a
then
let
this
insolent
caitiff
gosselin
be
relieved
of
his
irons
and
sent
on
shore
let
him
be
my
niece
servant
or
since
a
huguenot
marriage
is
as
good
as
any
in
the
presence
of
bears
and
buccaneers
let
her
call
the
hound
her
husband
if
she
likes
i
have
done
with
her
and
the
race
from
which
she
came
disowns
her
forever
thus
it
was
done
etienne
was
released
from
his
chains
and
sent
on
shore
an
arquebus
and
ammunition
were
given
him
and
resisting
the
impulse
to
send
his
first
shot
through
the
heart
of
his
tyrant
he
landed
and
the
last
glimpse
seen
of
the
group
as
the
sailed
away
was
the
figure
of
marguerite
sobbing
on
his
shoulder
and
of
the
unhappy
nurse
now
somewhat
plethoric
and
certainly
not
the
person
to
be
selected
as
a
pioneer
sitting
upon
a
rock
weeping
profusely
the
ship
sails
filled
the
angry
roberval
never
looked
back
on
his
deserted
niece
and
the
night
closed
down
upon
the
lonely
isle
of
demons
now
newly
occupied
by
three
unexpected
settlers
two
of
whom
at
least
were
happy
in
each
other
a
few
boxes
of
biscuits
a
few
bottles
of
wine
had
been
put
on
shore
with
them
enough
to
feed
them
for
a
few
weeks
they
had
brought
flint
and
steel
to
strike
fire
and
some
ammunition
the
chief
penalty
of
the
crime
did
not
lie
after
all
in
the
cold
and
the
starvation
and
the
wild
beasts
and
the
possible
visits
of
pirates
it
lay
in
the
fact
that
it
was
the
island
of
demons
where
they
were
to
be
left
and
in
that
superstitious
age
this
meant
everything
that
was
terrible
for
the
first
few
nights
of
their
stay
they
fancied
that
they
heard
superhuman
voices
in
every
wind
that
blew
every
branch
that
creaked
against
another
branch
and
they
heard
at
any
rate
more
substantial
sounds
from
the
nightly
wolves
or
from
the
bears
which
had
floated
to
that
northern
isle
they
watched
roberval
sail
away
he
rejoicing
as
the
old
legend
of
thevet
says
at
having
punished
them
without
soiling
his
hands
with
their
blood
de
les
auior
puniz
sans
se
souiller
les
mains
en
leurs
they
built
as
best
they
could
a
hut
of
boughs
and
strewed
beds
of
leaves
until
they
had
killed
wild
beasts
enough
to
prepare
their
skins
their
store
of
hard
bread
lasted
them
but
a
little
while
but
there
were
fruits
around
them
and
there
was
fresh
water
near
by
yet
it
was
terrible
says
thevet
old
narrative
to
hear
the
frightful
sounds
which
the
evil
spirits
made
around
them
and
how
they
tried
to
break
down
their
abode
and
showed
themselves
in
various
forms
of
frightful
animals
yet
at
last
conquered
by
the
constancy
and
perseverance
of
these
repentant
christians
the
tormentors
afflicted
or
disquieted
them
no
more
save
that
often
in
the
night
they
heard
cries
so
loud
that
it
seemed
as
if
more
than
five
thousand
men
were
assembled
together
de
cent
mil
homes
qui
fussent
so
passed
many
months
of
desolation
and
alas
the
husband
was
the
first
to
yield
daily
he
climbed
the
rocks
to
look
for
vessels
each
night
he
descended
sadder
and
sadder
he
waked
while
the
others
slept
feeling
that
it
was
he
who
had
brought
distress
upon
the
rest
he
concealed
his
depression
but
it
soon
was
past
concealing
he
only
redoubled
his
care
and
watching
as
his
wife
grew
the
stronger
of
the
two
and
he
faded
slowly
away
and
died
his
wife
had
nothing
to
sustain
her
spirits
except
the
approach
of
maternity
she
would
live
for
her
child
when
the
child
was
born
and
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
holy
church
though
without
the
church
full
ceremonies
marguerite
felt
the
strength
of
motherhood
became
a
better
huntress
a
better
provider
a
new
sorrow
came
in
the
sixteenth
or
seventeenth
month
of
her
stay
the
old
nurse
died
also
and
not
long
after
the
baby
followed
marguerite
now
seemed
to
herself
deserted
even
by
heaven
itself
she
was
alone
in
that
northern
island
without
comradeship
her
husband
child
and
nurse
gone
dependent
for
very
food
on
the
rapidly
diminishing
supply
of
ammunition
her
head
swam
for
months
she
saw
visions
almost
constantly
which
only
strenuous
prayer
banished
and
only
the
acquired
habit
of
the
chase
enabled
her
almost
mechanically
to
secure
meat
to
support
life
fortunately
those
especial
sights
and
sounds
of
demons
which
had
haunted
her
imagination
during
the
first
days
and
nights
on
the
island
did
not
recur
but
the
wild
beasts
gathered
round
her
the
more
when
there
was
only
one
gun
to
alarm
them
and
she
once
shot
three
bears
in
a
day
one
a
white
bear
of
which
she
secured
the
skin
what
imagination
can
depict
the
terrors
of
those
lonely
days
and
still
lonelier
nights
most
persons
left
as
solitary
tenants
of
an
island
have
dwelt
like
alexander
selkirk
in
regions
nearer
the
tropics
where
there
was
at
least
a
softened
air
a
fertile
soil
and
the
southern
cross
above
their
heads
but
to
be
solitary
in
a
prolonged
winter
to
be
alone
with
the
northern
lights
this
offered
peculiar
terrors
to
be
to
hear
the
wolves
in
their
long
and
dreary
howl
to
protect
the
very
graves
of
her
beloved
from
being
dug
up
to
watch
the
floating
icebergs
not
knowing
what
new
and
savage
visitor
might
be
borne
by
them
to
the
island
what
a
complication
of
terror
was
this
for
marguerite
for
two
years
and
five
months
in
all
she
dwelt
upon
the
isle
of
demons
the
last
year
wholly
alone
then
as
she
stood
upon
the
shore
some
breton
seeking
codfish
came
in
sight
making
signals
with
fire
and
calling
for
aid
she
drew
them
nearer
but
she
was
now
dressed
in
furs
only
and
seemed
to
them
but
one
of
the
fancied
demons
of
the
island
beating
up
slowly
and
watchfully
toward
the
shore
they
came
within
hearing
of
her
voice
and
she
told
her
dreary
tale
at
last
they
took
her
in
charge
and
bore
her
back
to
france
with
the
bearskins
she
had
prepared
and
taking
refuge
in
the
village
of
nautron
in
a
remote
province
perigord
where
she
could
escape
the
wrath
of
roberval
she
told
her
story
to
thevet
the
explorer
to
the
princess
marguerite
of
navarre
sister
of
francis
i
and
to
others
thevet
tells
it
in
his
cosmographie
and
marguerite
of
navarre
in
her
cent
nouvelles
nouvelles
she
told
thevet
that
after
the
first
two
months
the
demons
came
to
her
no
more
until
she
was
left
wholly
alone
then
they
renewed
their
visits
but
not
continuously
and
she
felt
less
fear
thevet
also
records
of
her
this
touching
confession
that
when
the
time
came
for
her
to
embark
in
the
breton
ship
for
home
there
came
over
her
a
strong
impulse
to
refuse
the
embarkation
but
rather
to
die
in
that
solitary
place
as
her
husband
her
child
and
her
servant
had
already
died
this
profound
touch
of
human
nature
does
more
than
anything
else
to
confirm
the
tale
as
substantially
true
certain
it
is
that
the
lonely
island
which
appeared
so
long
on
the
old
maps
as
the
isle
of
demons
de
demoni
appears
differently
in
later
ones
as
the
lady
island
de
la
demoiselle
the
princess
marguerite
of
navarre
who
died
in
seems
also
to
have
known
her
namesake
at
her
retreat
in
perigord
gives
some
variations
from
thevet
story
and
describes
her
as
having
been
put
on
shore
with
her
husband
because
of
frauds
which
he
had
practised
on
roberval
nor
does
she
speak
of
the
nurse
or
of
the
child
but
she
gives
a
similar
description
of
marguerite
stay
on
the
island
after
his
death
and
says
that
although
she
lived
what
might
seem
a
bestial
life
as
to
her
body
it
was
a
life
wholly
angelic
as
regarded
her
soul
vivant
quant
au
corps
de
vie
bestiale
et
quant
à
de
vie
she
had
the
princess
also
says
a
mind
cheerful
and
content
in
a
body
emaciated
and
half
dead
she
was
afterwards
received
with
great
honor
in
france
according
to
the
princess
and
was
encouraged
to
establish
a
school
for
little
children
where
she
taught
reading
and
writing
to
the
daughters
of
families
and
by
this
honest
industry
says
the
princess
she
supported
herself
during
the
remainder
of
her
life
having
no
other
wish
than
to
exhort
every
one
to
love
and
confidence
towards
god
offering
them
as
an
example
the
great
pity
which
he
had
shown
for
her
xx
bimini
and
the
fountain
of
youth
when
juan
ponce
de
leon
set
forth
from
porto
rico
march
to
seek
the
island
of
bimini
and
its
fountain
of
youth
he
was
moved
by
the
love
of
adventure
more
than
by
that
of
juvenility
for
he
was
then
but
about
fifty
a
time
when
a
cavalier
of
his
day
thought
himself
but
in
his
prime
he
looked
indeed
with
perpetual
sorrow
as
much
of
it
as
a
spaniard
of
those
days
could
feel
upon
his
kinsman
luis
ponce
once
a
renowned
warrior
but
on
whom
age
had
already
at
laid
its
hand
in
earnest
there
was
little
in
this
slowly
moving
veteran
to
recall
one
who
had
shot
through
the
lists
at
the
tournament
and
had
advanced
with
his
short
sword
at
the
bull
fight
who
had
ruled
his
vassals
and
won
the
love
of
women
it
was
a
vain
hope
of
restored
youth
which
had
brought
don
luis
from
spain
to
porto
rico
four
years
before
and
when
ponce
de
leon
had
subdued
that
island
his
older
kinsman
was
forever
beseeching
him
to
carry
his
flag
farther
and
not
stop
till
he
had
reached
bimini
and
sought
the
fountain
of
youth
for
what
end
he
said
should
you
stay
here
longer
and
lord
it
over
these
miserable
natives
let
us
go
where
we
can
bathe
in
those
enchanted
waters
and
be
young
once
more
i
need
it
and
you
will
need
it
ere
long
how
know
we
said
his
kinsman
that
there
is
any
such
place
all
know
it
said
luis
peter
martyr
saith
that
there
is
in
bimini
a
continual
spring
of
running
water
of
such
marvellous
virtue
that
the
water
thereof
being
drunk
perhaps
with
some
diet
maketh
old
men
young
and
he
adds
that
an
indian
grievously
oppressed
with
old
age
moved
with
the
fame
of
that
fountain
and
allured
through
the
love
of
longer
life
went
to
an
island
near
unto
the
country
of
florida
to
drink
of
the
desired
fountain
and
having
well
drunk
and
washed
himself
for
many
days
with
the
appointed
remedies
by
them
who
kept
the
bath
he
is
reported
to
have
brought
home
a
manly
strength
and
to
have
used
all
manly
exercises
let
us
therefore
go
thither
he
cried
and
be
like
him
they
set
sail
with
three
brigantines
and
found
without
difficulty
the
island
of
bimini
among
the
lucayos
or
bahamas
islands
but
when
they
searched
for
the
fountain
of
youth
they
were
pointed
farther
westward
to
florida
where
there
was
said
to
be
a
river
of
the
same
magic
powers
called
the
jordan
touching
at
many
a
fair
island
green
with
trees
and
occupied
by
a
gentle
population
till
then
undisturbed
it
was
not
strange
if
nearing
the
coast
of
florida
both
juan
ponce
de
leon
and
his
more
impatient
cousin
expected
to
find
the
fountain
of
youth
they
came
at
last
to
an
inlet
which
led
invitingly
up
among
wooded
banks
and
flowery
valleys
and
here
the
older
knight
said
let
us
disembark
here
and
strike
inland
my
heart
tells
me
that
here
at
last
will
be
found
the
fountain
of
youth
nonsense
said
juan
our
way
lies
by
water
then
leave
me
here
with
my
men
said
luis
he
had
brought
with
him
five
servants
mostly
veterans
from
his
own
estate
in
spain
a
fierce
discussion
ended
in
luis
obtaining
his
wish
and
being
left
for
a
fortnight
of
exploration
his
kinsman
promising
to
come
for
him
again
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
john
the
men
left
on
shore
were
themselves
past
middle
age
and
the
more
eager
for
their
quest
they
climbed
a
hill
and
watched
the
brigantines
disappear
in
the
distance
then
set
up
a
cross
which
they
had
brought
with
them
and
prayed
before
it
bareheaded
sending
the
youngest
of
his
men
up
to
the
top
of
a
tree
luis
learned
from
him
that
they
were
on
an
island
after
all
and
this
cheered
him
much
as
making
it
more
likely
that
they
should
find
the
fountain
of
youth
he
saw
that
the
ground
was
pawed
up
as
if
in
a
and
that
there
was
a
path
leading
to
huts
taking
this
path
they
met
fifty
indian
bowmen
who
whether
large
or
not
seemed
to
them
like
giants
the
spaniards
gave
them
beads
and
and
each
received
in
return
an
arrow
as
a
token
of
friendship
the
indians
promised
them
food
in
the
morning
and
brought
fish
roots
and
pure
water
and
finding
them
chilly
from
the
coldness
of
the
night
carried
them
in
their
arms
to
their
homes
first
making
four
or
five
large
fires
on
the
way
at
the
houses
there
were
many
fires
and
the
spaniards
would
have
been
wholly
comfortable
had
they
not
thought
it
just
possible
that
they
were
to
be
offered
as
a
sacrifice
still
fearing
this
they
left
their
indian
friends
after
a
few
days
and
traversed
the
country
stopping
at
every
spring
or
fountain
to
test
its
quality
alas
they
all
grew
older
and
more
worn
in
look
as
time
went
on
and
farther
from
the
fountain
of
youth
after
a
time
they
came
upon
new
tribes
of
indians
and
as
they
went
farther
from
the
coast
these
people
seemed
more
and
more
friendly
they
treated
the
white
men
as
if
come
from
heaven
brought
them
food
made
them
houses
carried
every
burden
for
them
some
had
bows
and
went
upon
the
hills
for
deer
and
brought
half
a
dozen
every
night
for
their
guests
others
killed
hares
and
rabbits
by
arranging
themselves
in
a
circle
and
striking
down
the
game
with
billets
of
wood
as
it
ran
from
one
to
another
through
the
woods
all
this
game
was
brought
to
the
visitors
to
be
breathed
upon
and
blessed
and
when
this
had
to
be
done
for
several
hundred
people
it
became
troublesome
the
women
also
brought
wild
fruit
and
would
eat
nothing
till
the
guests
had
seen
and
touched
it
if
the
visitors
seemed
offended
the
natives
were
terrified
and
apparently
thought
that
they
should
die
unless
they
had
the
favor
of
these
wise
and
good
men
farther
on
people
did
not
come
out
into
the
paths
to
gather
round
them
as
the
first
had
done
but
stayed
meekly
in
their
houses
sitting
with
their
faces
turned
to
the
wall
and
with
their
property
heaped
in
the
middle
of
the
room
from
these
people
the
travellers
received
many
valuable
skins
and
other
gifts
wherever
there
was
a
fountain
the
natives
readily
showed
it
but
apparently
knew
nothing
of
any
miraculous
gift
yet
they
themselves
were
in
such
fine
physical
condition
and
seemed
so
young
and
so
active
that
it
was
as
if
they
had
already
bathed
in
some
magic
spring
they
had
wonderful
endurance
of
heat
and
cold
and
such
health
that
when
their
bodies
were
pierced

convinced

that
even
if

indians
would
not
disclose
the
source
of
all
their
bodily
freshness
it
must
at

lie
somewhere
in

neighborhood
yet
a
little
while
no
doubt
and
their
visitors
would
reach
it
it
was
a
strange
journey
for
these
gray
and
careworn
men
as
they
passed
up
the
defiles
and
valleys
along
the
john
river
beyond
the
spot
where
now
spreads
the
city

and
green
cove
yellow
jasmines
trailed
their
festoons
above
their
heads
wild
roses
grew
at
their
feet
the
air
was
filled
with
the
aromatic
odors
of
pine
or
sweet
bay
the
long
gray
moss
hung
from
the
branches
birds
and
butterflies
of
wonderful
hues
fluttered
around
them
and
strange
lizards
crossed
their
paths
or
looked
with
dull
and
blinking
eyes
from
the
branches
they
came
at
last
to
one
spring
which
widened
into
a
natural
basin
and
which
was
so
deliciously
aromatic
that
luis
ponce
said
on
emerging
it
is
enough
i
have
bathed
in
the
fountain
of
youth
and
henceforth
i
am
young
his
companions
tried
it
and
said
the
same
the
fountain
of

is
found
no
time
must
now
be
lost
in
proclaiming
the
great
discovery
they
obtained
a
boat
from
the
natives
who
wept
at
parting
with
the
white
strangers
whom
they
had
so
loved
in
this
boat
they
proposed
to
reach
the
mouth
of
the
john
meet
juan
ponce
de
leon
and
carry
back
the
news
to
spain
but
one
native
whose
wife
and
children
they
had
cured
and
who
had
grown
angry
at
their
refusal
to
stay
longer
went
down
to
the
water
edge
and
sending
an
arrow
from
his
bow
transfixed
don
luis
so
that
even
his
foretaste
of
the
fountain
could
not
save
him
and
he
died
ere
reaching
the
mouth
of
the
river
if
don
luis
ever
reached
what
he
sought
it
was
in
another
world
but
those
who
have
ever
bathed
in
green
cove
spring
near
magnolia
on
the
john
river
will
be
ready
to
testify

merlin
in

merlin
was
known
mainly
by
a
series
of
remarkable
prophecies
which
were
attributed
to
him
and
were
often
said
to
be
fulfilled
by
actual
events
in

thus
one
of
the
many
places
where
merlin
grave
was
said
to
be
was

in
tweeddale
scotland
on
the
east
side
of
the
churchyard
a
brook
called
the
pansayl
falls
into
the

was
this
prophecy
as
to
their
union
when
tweed
and
pansayl
join
at
merlin
grave
scotland

of
james

of
scotland
the
tweed
accordingly
overflowed
and
joined
the
pansayl
at
the
prophet
grave
it
was
also
claimed
by
one
of
the
witnesses
at
the
trial
of
jeanne
that
there
was
a
prediction
by
merlin
that
france
would
be
saved
by
a
peasant

prophesies
have
been
often
reprinted

in

form
quoted
below
the
legends
of
brandan
it
will
be
observed
resemble
so
much
the
tales
of
sindbad
the
sailor
and
others
in
the
arabian
nights
which
have
also
the
the
singing
birds
and
other
features
that
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
that
some
features
of
tradition
were
held
in
common
with
the
arabs
of
spain
in
later
years
the
twelfth
century
a
geographer
named
honoré
declared
in
his
image
of
the
world
that
there
was
in
the
ocean
a
certain
island
agreeable
and
fertile
beyond
all
others
now
unknown
to
men
once
discovered
by
chance
and
then
lost
again
and
that
this
island
was
the
one
which
brandan
had
visited
in
several
early
maps
before
the
time
of
columbus
the
madeira
islands
appear
as
the
fortunate
islands
of
brandan
and
on
the
famous
globe
of
martin
behaim
made
in
the
very
year
when
columbus
sailed
there
is
a
large
island
much
farther
west
than
madeira
and
near
the
equator
with
an
inscription
saying
that
in
the
year
brandan
arrived
at
this
island
and
saw
many
wondrous
things
returning
to
his
own
land
afterwards
columbus
heard
this
island
mentioned
at
ferro
where
men
declared
that
they
had
seen
it
in
the
distance
later
the
chart
of
ortelius
in
the
sixteenth
century
carried
it
to
the
neighborhood
of
ireland
then
it
was
carried
south
again
and
was
supposed
all
the
time
to
change
its
place
through
enchantment
and
when
emanuel
of
portugal
in
renounced
all
claim
to
it
he
described
it
as
the
hidden
island
in
a
portuguese
expedition
was
sent
which
claimed
actually
to
have
touched
the
mysterious
island
indeed
to
have
found
there
the
vast
impression
of
a
human
foot
doubtless
of
the
baptized
giant
mildus
and
also
a
cross
nailed
to
a
tree
and
three
stones
laid
in
a
triangle
for
cooking
food
departing
hastily
from
the
island
they
left
two
sailors
behind
but
could
never
find
the
place
again
again
and
again
expeditions
were
sent
out
in
search
of
island
usually
from
the
canaries
one
in
by
acosta
one
in
by
dominguez
and
several
sketches
of
the
island
as
seen
from
a
distance
were
published
in
by
a
franciscan
priest
in
the
canary
islands
named
viere
y
clarijo
including
one
made
by
himself
on
may
about
in
presence
of
more
than
forty
witnesses
all
these
sketches
depict
the
island
as
having
its
chief
length
from
north
to
south
and
formed
of
two
unequal
hills
the
highest
of
these
being
at
the
north
they
having
between
them
a
depression
covered
with
trees
the
fact
that
this
resembles
the
general
form
of
palma
one
of
the
canary
islands
has
led
to
the
belief
that
it
may
have
been
an
ocean
mirage
reproducing
the
image
of
that
island
just
as
the
legends
themselves
reproduce
here
and
there
the
traditions
of
the
arabian
nights
in
a
map
drawn
by
the
florentine
physician
toscanelli
which
was
sent
by
him
to
columbus
in
to
give
his
impression
of
the
asiatic
coast
lying
as
he
supposed
across
the
atlantic
there
appears
the
island
of
brandan
it
is
as
large
as
all
the
azores
or
canary
islands
or
cape
de
verde
islands
put
together
its
southern
tip
just
touches
the
equator
and
it
lies
about
between
the
cape
de
verde
islands
and
zipangu
or
japan
which
was
then
believed
to
lie
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
winsor
also
tells
us
that
the
apparition
of
this
island
sometimes
came
to
sailors
eyes
as
late
as
the
last
century
winsor
columbus
he
also
gives
a
reproduction
of

lost

can
be

xiv
island
of
satan
hand
the
early
part
of
this
narrative
is
founded
on
professor
lectures
on
the
manuscript
materials
of
irish
history
it
being
another
of
those
imrama
or
narratives
of
ocean
expeditions
to
which
the
tale
of
brandan
belongs
the
original
narrative
lands
the
three
brothers
ultimately
in
spain
and
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
most
of
what
we
know
of
the
island
of
satanaxio
or
satanajio
which
remained
so
long
on
the
maps
is
taken
from
an
italian
narrative
of
three
other
brothers
cited
by
formaleoni
il
pellegrinaccio
di
tre
giovanni
by
christoforo
armeno
gaffarel
les
iles
fantastiques
the
coincidence
is
so
peculiar
that
it
offered
an
irresistible
temptation
to
link
the
two
trios
of
brothers
into
one
narrative
and
let
the
original
voyagers
do
the
work
of
exploration
the
explanation
given
by
gaffarel
to
the
tale
is
the
same
that
i
have
suggested
as
possible
he
says
in
iles
fantastiques
de
nous
était
permis
une
hypothèse
nous
croirions
voluntiers
que
les
navigateurs
de
rencontrèrent
en
dans
de
ces
gigantesques
icebergs
ou
montagnes
de
glace
arrachés
aux
banquises
du
pôle
nord
et
entraînés
au
sud
par
les
courants
dont
la
rencontre
assez
fréquente
est
même
tellement
redoutée
par
les
capitaines
ces
icebergs
quand
ils
se
heurtent
contre
un
navire
le
coulent
à
pic
et
comme
ils
arrivent
à
escortés
par
brouillards
ils
paraissent
réellement
sortir
du
sein
des
flots
comme
sortait
la
main
de
satan
pour
précipiter
au
fond
de
matelots
et
navires
as
to
the
name
itself
there
has
been
much
discussion
on
the
map
of
bianco
reproduced
in
winsor
the
name
ya
de
lamansatanaxio
distinctly
appears
and
this
was
translated
by
both
formaleoni
and
humboldt
as
meaning
the
island
of
the
hand
of
satan
was
the
first
to
suggest
that
the
reference
was
to
two
separate
islands
the
one
named
de
la
man
or
danman
and
the
other
satanaxio
he
further
suggests
followed
by
gaffarel
that
the
name
of
the
island
may
originally
have
been
san
atanagio
thus
making
its
baptism
a
tribute
to
athanasius
instead
of
to
satan
this
would
certainly
have
been
a
curious
transformation
and
almost
as
unexpected
in
its
way
as
the
original
conversion
of
the
sinful
brothers
from
outlaws
to
missionaries
xv
antillia
the
name
antillia
appears
first
but
not
very
clearly
on
the
pizigani
map
of

clearly
on

map
of

at

which
adds
in
an
inscription
the
story
of
the
seven
bishops
on
some
maps
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
there
appears
near
it
a
smaller
island
under
the
name
of
sette
cidade
or
sete
ciudades
which
is
properly
another
name
for
the
same
island
toscanelli
in
his
famous
letter
to
columbus
recommended
antillia
as
a
good
for
his
voyage
to
india
the
island
is
said
by
tradition
to
have
been
by
a
portuguese
sailor
in
tradition
says
that
this
sailor
went
hastily
to
the
court
of
portugal
to
announce
the
discovery
but
was
blamed
for
not
having
remained
longer
and
so
fled
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
large
rectangular
island
extending
from
north
to
south
lying
in
the
mid
atlantic
about
lat
an
ample
bibliography

island
of

the
tale
of
the
isle
of

is
founded
on
a
story
told
first
by
marguerite
of
navarre
in
her
heptameron
lxvii
nouvelle
and
then
with
much
variation
and
amplification
by
the
very
untrustworthy

the
only
copy
of
the
latter
work
known
to

is

the

has
been
transcribed
for
me
through

of

at

a

abstract
of
the
story
is

note
but
it
states
perhaps
erroneously
that
thevet
knew
marguerite
only
through
the
princess
of
navarre

that
author
claims
though
his
claim
is
never
worth
much
that
he
had
the

from
