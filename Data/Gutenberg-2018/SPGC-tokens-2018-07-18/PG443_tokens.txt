the
love
affairs
of
a
bibliomaniac
by
eugene
field
introduction
the
determination
to
found
a
story
or
a
series
of
sketches
on
the
delights
adventures
and
misadventures
connected
with
bibliomania
did
not
come
impulsively
to
my
brother
for
many
years
in
short
during
the
greater
part
of
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
of
journalistic
work
he
had
celebrated
in
prose
and
verse
and
always
in
his
happiest
and
most
delightful
vein
the
pleasures
of
himself
an
indefatigable
collector
of
books
the
possessor
of
a
library
as
valuable
as
it
was
interesting
a
library
containing
volumes
obtained
only
at
the
cost
of
great
personal
sacrifice
he
was
in
the
most
active
sympathy
with
the
disease
called
bibliomania
and
knew
as
few
comparatively
poor
men
have
known
the
side
of
that
incurable
mental
infirmity
the
newspaper
column
to
which
he
contributed
almost
daily
for
twelve
years
comprehended
many
sly
digs
and
gentle
scoffings
at
those
of
his
unhappy
fellow
citizens
who
became
notorious
through
his
instrumentality
in
their
devotion
to
old
and
auction
sales
and
all
the
time
none
was
more
assiduous
than
this
same
cynic
in
running
down
a
musty
prize
no
matter
what
its
cost
or
what
the
attending
difficulties
i
save
others
myself
i
can
not
save
was
his
humorous
cry
in
his
published
writings
are
many
evidences
of
my
appreciation
of
what
he
has
somewhere
characterized
the
soothing
affliction
of
bibliomania
nothing
of
love
has
been
more
happily
expressed
than
the
bibliomaniac
prayer
in
which
the
troubled
petitioner
fervently
asserts
but
if
o
lord
it
pleaseth
thee
to
keep
me
in
temptation
way
i
humbly
ask
that
i
may
be
most
notably
beset
let
my
temptation
be
a
book
which
i
shall
purchase
hold
and
keep
whereon
when
other
men
shall
look
they
wail
to
know
i
got
it
cheap
and
again
in
the
bibliomaniac
bride
nothing
breathes
better
the
spirit
of
the
incurable
patient
than
this
prose
for
me
when
i
wished
for
prose
verse
when
to
verse
inclined
forever
bringing
sweet
repose
to
body
heart
and
mind
oh
i
should
bind
this
priceless
prize
in
bindings
full
and
fine
and
keep
her
where
no
human
eyes
should
see
her
charms
but
mine
in
dear
old
london
the
poet
wailed
that
a
splendid
horace
cheap
for
cash
laughed
at
his
poverty
and
in
dibdin
ghost
he
revelled
in
the
delights
that
await
the
bibliomaniac
in
the
future
state
where
there
is
no
admission
to
the
women
folk
who
wanting
victuals
make
a
fuss
if
we
buy
books
instead
while
in
flail
trask
and
bisland
is
the
very
essence
of
bibliomania
the
unquenchable
thirst
for
possession
and
yet
despite
these
bibliophily
rather
than
bibliomania
would
be
the
word
to
characterize
his
conscientious
purpose
if
he
purchased
quaint
and
rare
books
it
was
to
own
them
to
the
full
extent
inwardly
as
well
as
outwardly
the
mania
for
books
kept
him
continually
buying
the
love
of
books
supervened
to
make
them
a
part
of
himself
and
his
life
toward
the
close
of
august
of
the
present
year
my
brother
wrote
the
first
chapter
of
the
love
affairs
of
a
bibliomaniac
at
that
time
he
was
in
an
exhausted
physical
condition
and
apparently
unfit
for
any
protracted
literary
labor
but
the
prospect
of
gratifying
a
ambition
the
delight
of
beginning
the
story
he
had
planned
so
hopefully
seemed
to
give
him
new
strength
and
he
threw
himself
into
the
work
with
an
enthusiasm
that
was
alas
misleading
to
those
who
had
noted
fearfully
his
declining
vigor
of
body
for
years
no
literary
occupation
had
seemed
to
give
him
equal
pleasure
and
in
the
discussion
of
the
progress
of
his
writing
from
day
to
day
his
eye
would
brighten
all
of
his
old
animation
would
return
and
everything
would
betray
the
lively
interest
he
felt
in
the
creature
of
his
imagination
in
whom
he
was
living
over
the
delights
of
the
chase
it
was
his
ardent
wish
that
this
work
for
the
fulfilment
of
which
he
had
been
so
long
preparing
should
be
as
he
playfully
expressed
it
a
monument
of
apologetic
compensation
to
a
class
of
people
he
had
so
humorously
maligned
and
those
who
knew
him
intimately
will
recognize
in
the
shortcomings
of
the
bibliomaniac
the
humble
confession
of
his
own
weaknesses
it
is
easy
to
understand
from
the
very
nature
of
the
undertaking
that
it
was
practically
limitless
that
a
bibliomaniac
of
so
many
experience
could
prattle
on
indefinitely
concerning
his
love
affairs
and
at
the
same
time
be
in
no
danger
of
repetition
indeed
my
brother
plans
at
the
outset
were
not
definitely
formed
he
would
say
when
questioned
or
joked
about
these
amours
that
he
was
in
the
easy
position
of
sam
weller
when
he
indited
his
famous
valentine
and
could
pull
up
at
any
moment
one
week
he
would
contend
that
a
ought
to
be
good
for
a
year
at
least
and
the
next
week
he
would
argue
as
strongly
that
it
was
time
to
send
the
old
man
into
winter
quarters
and
go
to
press
but
though
the
approach
of
cold
weather
increased
his
physical
indisposition
he
was
not
the
less
interested
in
his
prescribed
hours
of
labor
howbeit
his
weakness
warned
him
that
he
should
say
to
his
book
as
his
horace
had
written
fuge
quo
descendere
gestis
non
erit
emisso
reditis
tibi
was
it
strange
that
his
heart
should
relent
and
that
he
should
write
on
unwilling
to
give
the
word
of
dismissal
to
the
book
whose
preparation
had
been
a
work
of
such
love
and
solace
during
the
afternoon
of
saturday
november
the
nineteenth
instalment
of
the
love
affairs
was
written
it
was
the
conclusion
of
his
literary
life
the
verses
supposably
contributed
by
judge
friend
with
which
the
chapter
ends
were
the
last
words
written
by
eugene
field
he
was
at
that
time
apparently
quite
as
well
as
on
any
day
during
the
fall
months
and
neither
he
nor
any
member
of
his
family
had
the
slightest
premonition
that
death
was
hovering
about
the
household
the
next
day
though
still
feeling
indisposed
he
was
at
times
up
and
about
always
cheerful
and
full
of
that
sweetness
and
sunshine
which
in
his
last
years
seem
now
to
have
been
the
preparation
for
the
life
beyond
he
spoke
of
the
chapter
he
had
written
the
day
before
and
it
was
then
that
he
outlined
his
plan
of
completing
the
work
one
chapter
only
remained
to
be
written
and
it
was
to
chronicle
the
death
of
the
old
bibliomaniac
but
not
until
he
had
unexpectedly
fallen
heir
to
a
very
rare
and
almost
priceless
copy
of
horace
which
acquisition
marked
the
pinnacle
of
the
conquest
true
to
his
love
for
the
sabine
singer
the
western
poet
characterized
the
immortal
odes
of
twenty
centuries
gone
the
greatest
happiness
of
bibliomania
in
the
early
morning
of
november
the
soul
of
eugene
field
passed
upward
on
the
table
folded
and
sealed
were
the
memoirs
of
the
old
man
upon
whom
the
sentence
of
death
had
been
pronounced
on
the
bed
in
the
corner
of
the
room
with
one
arm
thrown
over
his
breast
and
the
smile
of
peace
and
rest
on
his
tranquil
face
the
poet
lay
all
around
him
on
the
shelves
and
in
the
cases
were
the
books
he
loved
so
well
ah
who
shall
say
that
on
that
morning
his
fancy
was
not
verified
and
that
as
the
gray
light
came
reverently
through
the
window
those
cherished
volumes
did
not
bestir
themselves
awaiting
the
cheery
voice
good
day
to
you
my
sweet
friends
how
lovingly
they
beam
upon
me
and
how
glad
they
are
that
my
rest
has
been
unbroken
could
they
beam
upon
you
less
lovingly
great
heart
in
the
chamber
warmed
by
your
affection
and
now
sanctified
by
death
were
they
less
glad
to
know
that
the
repose
would
be
unbroken
forevermore
since
it
came
the
glorious
reward
my
brother
of
the
friend
who
went
gladly
to
it
through
his
faith
having
striven
for

at
this
moment
when
i
am
about
to
begin
the
most
important
undertaking
of
my
life
i
recall
the
sense
of
abhorrence
with
which
i
have
at
different
times
read
the
confessions
of
men
famed
for
their
prowess
in
the
realm
of
love
these
boastings
have
always
shocked
me
for
i
reverence
love
as
the
noblest
of
the
passions
and
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
conceive
how
one
who
has
truly
fallen
victim
to
its
benign
influence
can
ever
thereafter
speak
flippantly
of
it
yet
there
have
been
and
there
still
are
many
who
take
a
seeming
delight
in
telling
you
how
many
conquests
they
have
made
and
they
not
infrequently
have
the
bad
taste
to
explain
with
wearisome
prolixity
the
ways
and
the
means
whereby
those
conquests
were
wrought
as
forsooth
an
unfeeling
huntsman
is
forever
boasting
of
the
game
he
has
slaughtered
and
is
forever
dilating
upon
the
repulsive
details
of
his
butcheries
i
have
always
contended
that
one
who
is
in
love
and
having
once
been
in
love
is
to
be
always
in
love
has
actually
no
confession
to
make
love
is
so
guileless
so
proper
so
pure
a
passion
as
to
involve
none
of
those
things
which
require
or
which
admit
of
confession
he
therefore
who
surmises
that
in
this
exposition
of
my
affaires
du
coeur
there
is
to
be
any
betrayal
of
confidences
or
any
discussion
suggestion
or
hint
likely
either
to
shame
love
or
its
votaries
or
to
bring
a
blush
to
the
cheek
of
the
fastidious
he
is
grievously
in
error
nor
am
i
going
to
boast
for
i
have
made
no
conquests
i
am
in
no
sense
a
hero
for
many
very
many
years
i
have
walked
in
a
pleasant
garden
enjoying
sweet
odors
and
soothing
spectacles
no
predetermined
itinerary
has
controlled
my
course
i
have
wandered
whither
i
pleased
and
very
many
times
i
have
strayed
so
far
into
the
and
thickets
as
almost
to
have
lost
my
way
and
now
it
is
my
purpose
to
walk
that
pleasant
garden
once
more
inviting
you
to
bear
me
company
and
to
share
with
me
what
satisfaction
may
accrue
from
an
old
return
to
places
and
loves
as
a
child
i
was
i
cared
little
for
those
sports
which
usually
excite
the
ardor
of
youth
to
games
and
exercises
i
had
particular
aversion
i
was
born
in
a
southern
latitude
but
at
the
age
of
six
years
i
went
to
live
with
my
grandmother
in
new
hampshire
both
my
parents
having
fallen
victims
to
the
cholera
this
change
from
the
balmy
temperature
of
the
south
to
the
rigors
of
the
north
was
not
agreeable
to
me
and
i
have
always
held
it
responsible
for
that
delicate
health
which
has
attended
me
through
life
my
grandmother
encouraged
my
disinclination
to
play
she
recognized
in
me
that
certain
seriousness
of
mind
which
i
remember
to
have
heard
her
say
i
inherited
from
her
and
she
determined
to
make
of
me
what
she
had
failed
to
make
of
any
of
her
own
sons
a
professional
expounder
of
the
only
true
faith
of
congregationalism
for
this
reason
and
for
the
further
reason
that
at
the
tender
age
of
seven
years
i
publicly
avowed
my
desire
to
become
a
clergyman
an
ambition
wholly
sincere
at
that
time
for
these
reasons
was
i
duly
installed
as
prime
favorite
in
my
grandmother
affections
as
distinctly
as
though
it
were
but
yesterday
do
i
recall
the
time
when
i
met
my
first
love
it
was
in
the
front
room
of
the
old
homestead
and
the
day
was
a
day
in
spring
the
front
room
answered
those
purposes
which
are
served
by
the
parlor
of
the
present
time
i
remember
the
low
ceiling
the
big
fireplace
the
long
broad
mantelpiece
the
andirons
and
fender
of
brass
the
tall
clock
with
its
jocund
and
roseate
moon
the
bellows
that
was
always
wheezy
the
wax
flowers
under
a
glass
globe
in
the
corner
an
allegorical
picture
of
solomon
temple
another
picture
of
little
samuel
at
prayer
the
high
chairs
the
with
its
gayly
embroidered
top
the
mirror
in
its
frame
all
these
things
i
remember
well
and
with
feelings
of
tender
reverence
and
yet
that
day
i
now
recall
was
threescore
and
ten
years
ago
best
of
all
i
remember
the
case
in
which
my
grandmother
kept
her
books
a
mahogany
structure
massive
and
dark
with
doors
composed
of
figures
of
glass
cunningly
set
in
a
framework
of
lead
i
was
in
my
seventh
year
then
and
i
had
learned
to
read
i
know
not
when
the
back
and
current
numbers
of
the
had
fallen
prey
to
my
insatiable
appetite
for
literature
with
the
story
of
the
small
boy
who
stole
a
pin
repented
of
and
confessed
that
crime
and
then
became
a
good
and
great
man
i
was
as
familiar
as
if
i
myself
had
invented
that
ingenious
and
instructive
tale
i
could
lisp
the
moral
numbers
of
watts
and
the
didactic
hymns
of
wesley
and
the
annual
reports
of
the
american
tract
society
had
already
revealed
to
me
the
sphere
of
usefulness
in
which
my
grandmother
hoped
i
would
ultimately
figure
with
discretion
and
zeal
and
yet
my
heart
was
free
wholly
untouched
of
that
gentle
yet
deathless
passion
which
was
to
become
my
delight
my
inspiration
and
my
solace
it
awaited
the
coming
of
its
first
love
upon
one
of
those
shelves
yonder
it
is
the
third
shelf
from
the
top
fourth
compartment
to
the
right
is
that
old
copy
of
the
new
england
primer
a
curious
little
thin
square
book
in
faded
blue
board
covers
a
good
many
times
i
have
wondered
whether
i
ought
not
to
have
the
precious
little
thing
sumptuously
attired
in
the
finest
style
known
to
my
binder
indeed
i
have
often
been
tempted
to
exchange
the
homely
blue
board
covers
for
flexible
levant
for
it
occurred
to
me
that
in
this
way
i
could
testify
to
my
regard
for
the
treasured
volume
i
spoke
of
this
one
day
to
my
friend
judge
methuen
for
i
have
great
respect
for
his
judgment
it
would
be
a
desecration
said
he
to
deprive
the
book
of
its
original
binding
what
would
you
tear
off
and
cast
away
the
covers
which
have
felt
the
caressing
pressure
of
the
hands
of
those
whose
memory
you
revere
the
most
sacred
of
sentiments
should
forbid
that
act
of
vandalism
i
never
think
or
speak
of
the
new
england
primer
that
i
do
not
recall
captivity
waite
for
it
was
captivity
who
introduced
me
to
the
primer
that
day
in
the
springtime
of
years
ago
she
was
of
my
age
a
bright
pretty
girl
a
very
pretty
an
exceptionally
pretty
girl
as
girls
go
we
belonged
to
the
same
class
i
remember
that
upon
this
particular
day
she
brought
me
a
russet
apple
it
was
she
who
discovered
the
primer
in
the
mahogany
case
and
what
was
not
our
joy
as
we
turned
over
the
tiny
pages
together
and
feasted
our
eyes
upon
the
vivid
pictures
and
perused
the
absorbingly
interesting
text
what
wonder
that
together
we
wept
tears
of
sympathy
at
the
harrowing
recital
of
the
fate
of
john
rogers
even
at
this
remote
date
i
can
not
recall
that
experience
with
captivity
involving
as
it
did
the
representing
the
unfortunate
rogers
standing
in
an
impossible
bonfire
and
being
consumed
thereby
in
the
presence
of
his
wife
and
their
numerous
progeny
strung
along
in
a
pitiful
line
across
the
picture
for
artistic
effect
even
now
i
say
i
can
not
contemplate
that
experience
and
that
without
feeling
lumpy
in
my
throat
and
moist
about
my
eyes
how
lasting
are
the
impressions
made
upon
the
youthful
mind
through
the
many
busy
years
that
have
elapsed
since
first
i
tasted
the
thrilling
sweets
of
that
miniature
primer
i
have
not
forgotten
that
young
obadias
david
josias
all
were
pious
that
zaccheus
he
did
climb
the
tree
our
lord
to
see
and
that
vashti
for
pride
was
set
aside
and
still
with
many
a
sympathetic
shudder
and
tingle
do
i
recall
captivity
overpowering
sense
of
horror
and
mine
as
we
lingered
long
over
the
portraitures
of
timothy
flying
from
sin
of
xerxes
laid
out
in
funeral
garb
and
of
proud
korah
troop
partly
submerged
my
book
and
heart
must
never
part
so
runs
one
of
the
couplets
in
this
little
and
right
truly
can
i
say
that
from
the
springtime
day
years
ago
when
first
my
heart
went
out
in
love
to
this
little
book
no
change
of
scene
or
of
custom
no
allurement
of
fashion
no
demand
of
mature
years
has
abated
that
love
and
herein
is
exemplified
the
advantage
which
the
love
of
books
has
over
the
other
kinds
of
love
women
are
by
nature
fickle
and
so
are
men
their
friendships
are
liable
to
dissipation
at
the
merest
provocation
or
the
slightest
pretext
not
so
however
with
books
for
books
can
not
change
a
thousand
years
hence
they
are
what
you
find
them
speaking
the
same
words
holding
forth
the
same
cheer
the
same
promise
the
same
comfort
always
constant
laughing
with
those
who
laugh
and
weeping
with
those
who
weep
captivity
waite
was
an
exception
to
the
rule
governing
her
sex
in
all
candor
i
must
say
that
she
approached
closely
to
a
realization
of
the
ideals
of
a
book
a
sixteenmo
if
you
please
fair
to
look
upon
of
clear
clean
type
well
ordered
and
well
edited
amply
margined
neatly
bound
a
human
book
whose
text
as
represented
by
her
disposition
and
her
mind
corresponded
felicitously
with
the
comeliness
of
her
exterior
this
child
was
the
of
benjamin
waite
whose
family
was
carried
off
by
indians
in
benjamin
followed
the
party
to
canada
and
after
many
months
of
search
found
and
ransomed
the
captives
the
historian
has
properly
said
that
the
names
of
benjamin
waite
and
his
companion
in
their
perilous
journey
through
the
wilderness
to
canada
should
be
memorable
in
all
the
sad
or
happy
homes
of
this
connecticut
valley
forever
the
child
who
was
my
friend
in
youth
and
to
whom
i
may
allude
occasionally
hereafter
in
my
narrative
bore
the
name
of
one
of
the
survivors
of
this
indian
outrage
a
name
to
be
revered
as
a
remembrancer
of
sacrifice
and
heroism
ii
the
birth
of
a
new
passion
when
i
was
thirteen
years
old
i
went
to
visit
my
uncle
cephas
my
grandmother
would
not
have
parted
with
me
even
for
that
fortnight
had
she
not
actually
been
compelled
to
it
happened
that
she
was
called
to
a
meeting
of
the
american
tract
society
and
it
was
her
intention
to
pay
a
visit
to
her
cousin
royall
eastman
after
she
had
discharged
the
first
and
imperative
duty
she
owed
the
society
deacon
ranney
was
to
have
taken
me
and
provided
for
my
temporal
and
spiritual
wants
during
grandmother
absence
but
at
the
last
moment
the
deacon
came
down
with
one
of
his
spells
of
quinsy
and
no
other
alternative
remained
but
to
pack
me
off
to
nashua
where
my
uncle
cephas
lived
this
involved
considerable
expense
for
the
stage
fare
was
three
shillings
each
way
it
came
particularly
hard
on
grandmother
inasmuch
as
she
had
just
paid
her
road
tax
and
had
not
yet
received
her
dividends
on
her
fitchburg
railway
stock
indifferent
however
to
every
sense
of
extravagance
and
to
all
other
considerations
except
those
of
personal
pride
i
rode
away
atop
of
the
full
of
exultation
as
we
rattled
past
the
waite
house
i
waved
my
cap
to
captivity
and
indulged
in
the
pleasing
hope
that
she
would
be
lonesome
without
me
much
of
the
satisfaction
of
going
away
arises
from
the
thought
that
those
you
leave
behind
are
likely
to
be
wretchedly
miserable
during
your
absence
my
uncle
cephas
lived
in
a
house
so
very
different
from
my
grandmother
that
it
took
me
some
time
to
get
used
to
the
place
uncle
cephas
was
a
lawyer
and
his
style
of
living
was
not
at
all
like
grandmother
he
was
to
have
been
a
minister
but
at
twelve
years
of
age
he
attended
the
county
fair
and
that
incident
seemed
to
change
the
whole
bent
of
his
life
at
he
married
samantha
talbott
and
that
was
another
blow
to
grandmother
who
always
declared
that
the
talbotts
were
a
shiftless
lot
however
i
was
agreeably
impressed
with
uncle
cephas
and
aunt
for
they
welcomed
me
very
cordially
and
turned
me
over
to
my
little
cousins
mary
and
henry
and
bade
us
three
make
merry
to
the
best
of
our
ability
these
first
favorable
impressions
of
my
uncle
family
were
confirmed
when
i
discovered
that
for
supper
we
had
hot
biscuit
and
dried
beef
warmed
up
in
cream
gravy
a
diet
which
with
all
due
respect
to
grandmother
i
considered
much
more
desirable
than
dry
bread
and
sauce
aha
old
crusoe
i
see
thee
now
in
yonder
case
smiling
out
upon
me
as
cheerily
as
thou
didst
smile
those
many
years
ago
when
to
a
little
boy
thou
broughtest
the
message
of
romance
and
i
do
love
thee
still
and
i
shall
always
love
thee
not
only
for
thy
benefaction
in
those
ancient
days
but
also
for
the
light
and
the
cheer
which
thy
genius
brings
to
all
ages
and
conditions
of
humanity
my
uncle
cephas
library
was
stored
with
a
large
variety
of
pleasing
literature
i
did
not
observe
a
glut
of
theological
publications
and
i
will
admit
that
i
felt
somewhat
aggrieved
personally
when
in
answer
to
my
inquiry
i
was
told
that
there
was
no
new
england
primer
in
the
collection
but
this
feeling
was
soon
dissipated
by
the
absorbing
interest
i
took
in
de
foe
masterpiece
a
work
unparalleled
in
the
realm
of
fiction
i
shall
not
say
that
robinson
crusoe
supplanted
the
primer
in
my
affections
this
would
not
be
true
i
prefer
to
say
what
is
the
truth
it
was
my
second
love
here
again
we
behold
another
advantage
which
the
lover
of
books
has
over
the
lover
of
women
if
he
be
a
genuine
lover
he
can
and
should
love
any
number
of
books
and
this
polybibliophily
is
not
to
the
disparagement
of
any
one
of
that
number
but
it
is
held
by
the
expounders
of
our
civil
and
our
moral
laws
that
he
who
loveth
one
woman
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
women
speaketh
by
that
action
the
best
and
highest
praise
both
of
his
own
sex
and
of
hers
i
thank
god
continually
that
it
hath
been
my
lot
in
life
to
found
an
empire
in
my
heart
no
cramped
and
wizened
borough
wherein
one
jealous
mistress
hath
exercised
her
petty
tyranny
but
an
expansive
and
continent
divided
and
subdivided
into
dominions
jurisdictions
caliphates
chiefdoms
seneschalships
and
prefectures
wherein
tetrarchs
burgraves
maharajahs
palatines
seigniors
caziques
nabobs
emirs
nizams
and
nawabs
hold
sway
each
over
his
special
and
particular
realm
and
all
bound
together
in
harmonious
cooperation
by
the
conciliating
spirit
of
polybibliophily
let
me
not
be
misunderstood
for
i
am
not
a
i
do
not
regret
the
acquaintances
nay
the
friendships
i
have
formed
with
individuals
of
the
other
sex
as
a
philosopher
it
has
behooved
me
to
study
womankind
else
i
should
not
have
appreciated
the
worth
of
these
other
better
loves
moreover
i
take
pleasure
in
my
age
in
associating
this
precious
volume
or
that
with
one
woman
or
another
whose
friendship
came
into
my
life
at
the
time
when
i
was
reading
and
loved
that
book
the
other
day
i
found
my
nephew
william
swinging
in
the
hammock
on
the
porch
with
his
girl
friend
celia
i
saw
that
the
young
people
were
reading
ovid
my
children
said
i
count
this
day
a
happy
one
in
the
years
of
after
life
neither
of
you
will
speak
or
think
of
ovid
and
his
tender
verses
without
recalling
at
the
same
moment
how
of
a
gracious
afternoon
in
distant
time
you
sat
side
by
side
contemplating
the
ineffably
precious
promises
of
maturity
and
love
i
am
not
sure
that
i
do
not
approve
that
article
in
judge
creed
which
insists
that
in
this
life
of
ours
woman
serves
a
probationary
period
for
sins
of
omission
or
of
commission
in
a
previous
existence
and
that
woman
next
step
upward
toward
the
final
eternity
of
bliss
is
a
period
of
longer
or
of
shorter
duration
in
which
her
soul
enters
into
a
book
to
be
petted
fondled
beloved
and
cherished
by
some
good
man
like
the
judge
or
like
myself
for
that
matter
this
theory
is
not
an
unpleasant
one
i
regard
it
as
much
more
acceptable
than
those
scientific
demonstrations
which
would
make
us
suppose
that
we
are
descended
from
and
simians
however
it
is
far
from
my
purpose
to
enter
upon
any
argument
of
these
questions
at
this
time
for
judge
methuen
himself
is
going
to
write
a
book
upon
the
subject
and
the
edition
is
to
be
limited
to
two
numbered
and
signed
copies
upon
japanese
vellum
of
which
i
am
to
have
one
and
the
judge
the
other
the
impression
i
made
upon
uncle
cephas
must
have
been
favorable
for
when
my
next
birthday
rolled
around
there
came
with
it
a
book
from
uncle
cephas
my
third
love
grimm
household
stories
with
the
perusal
of
this
monumental
work
was
born
that
passion
for
fairy
tales
and
folklore
which
increased
rather
than
diminished
with
my
maturer
years
even
at
the
present
time
i
delight
in
a
good
fairy
story
and
i
am
grateful
to
lang
and
to
jacobs
for
the
benefit
they
have
conferred
upon
me
and
the
rest
of
humanity
through
the
medium
of
the
fairy
books
and
the
folk
tales
they
have
translated
and
compiled
and
lady
wilde
have
done
noble
work
in
the
same
realm
the
writings
of
the
former
have
interested
me
particularly
for
together
with
profound
learning
in
directions
which
are
specially
pleasing
to
me
has
a
distinct
literary
touch
which
invests
his
work
with
a
grace
indefinable
but
delicious
and
persuasive
i
am
so
great
a
lover
of
and
believer
in
fairy
tales
that
i
once
organized
a
society
for
the
dissemination
of
fairy
literature
and
at
the
first
meeting
of
this
society
we
resolved
to
demand
of
the
board
of
education
to
drop
mathematics
from
the
curriculum
in
the
public
schools
and
to
substitute
therefor
a
four
years
course
in
fairy
literature
to
be
followed
if
the
pupil
desired
by
a
course
in
demonology
and
we
hired
and
fitted
up
large
rooms
and
the
cause
seemed
to
be
flourishing
until
the
second
month
rent
fell
due
it
was
then
discovered
that
the
treasury
was
empty
and
with
this
discovery
the
society
ended
its
existence
without
having
accomplished
any
tangible
result
other
than
the
purchase
of
a
number
of
sofas
and
chairs
for
which
judge
methuen
and
i
had
to
pay
still
i
am
of
the
opinion
and
judge
methuen
indorses
it
that
we
need
in
this
country
of
ours
just
that
influence
which
the
fairy
tale
exerts
we
are
becoming
too
practical
the
lust
for
material
gain
is
throttling
every
other
consideration
our
babes
and
sucklings
are
no
longer
regaled
with
the
soothing
tales
of
giants
ogres
witches
and
fairies
their
hungry
receptive
minds
are
filled
with
stories
about
the
pursuit
and
slaughter
of
unoffending
animals
of
war
and
of
murder
and
of
those
questionable
practices
whereby
a
hero
is
enriched
and
others
are
impoverished
before
he
is
out
of
his
the
modern
youngster
is
convinced
that
the
one
noble
purpose
in
life
is
to
get
get
get
and
keep
on
getting
of
worldly
material
the
fairy
tale
is
tabooed
because
as
the
sordid
parent
alleges
it
makes
youth
unpractical
one
consequence
of
this
deplorable
condition
is
as
i
have
noticed
and
as
judge
methuen
has
too
that
the
human
eye
is
diminishing
in
size
and
fulness
and
is
losing
its
lustre
by
as
much
as
you
take
the
grace
of
fancy
from
man
by
so
much
do
you
impoverish
his
eyes
the
eye
is
so
beautiful
and
serves
so
very
many
noble
purposes
and
is
too
so
ready
in
the
expression
of
tenderness
of
pity
of
love
of
solicitude
of
compassion
of
dignity
of
every
gentle
mood
and
noble
inspiration
that
in
that
metaphor
which
contemplates
the
eternal
vigilance
of
the
almighty
we
recognize
the
best
poetic
expression
of
the
highest
human
wisdom
my
nephew
timothy
has
three
children
two
boys
and
a
girl
the
elder
boy
and
the
girl
have
small
black
eyes
they
are
as
devoid
of
fancy
as
a
napkin
is
of
red
corpuscles
they
put
their
pennies
into
a
tin
bank
and
they
have
won
all
the
marbles
and
in
the
neighborhood
they
do
not
believe
in
santa
claus
or
in
fairies
or
in
witches
they
know
that
two
nickels
make
a
dime
and
their
golden
rule
is
to
do
others
as
others
would
do
them
the
other
boy
he
has
been
christened
matthew
after
me
has
a
pair
of
large
round
eyes
expressive
of
all
those
emotions
which
a
keen
active
fancy
begets
matthew
can
never
get
his
fill
of
fairy
tales
and
how
the
dear
little
fellow
loves
santa
claus
he
sees
things
at
night
he
will
not
go
to
bed
in
the
dark
he
hears
and
understands
what
the
birds
and
crickets
say
and
what
the
night
wind
sings
and
what
the
rustling
leaves
tell
wherever
matthew
goes
he
sees
beautiful
pictures
and
hears
sweet
music
to
his
impressionable
soul
all
nature
speaks
its
wisdom
and
its
poetry
god
how
i
love
that
boy
and
he
shall
never
starve
a
goodly
share
of
what
i
have
shall
go
to
him
but
this
clause
in
my
will
which
the
judge
recently
drew
for
me
will
i
warrant
me
give
the
dear
child
the
greatest
happiness
item
to
my
beloved
grandnephew

i
do
bequeath

the
luxury
of
reading
in
bed
last
night
having
written
what
you
have
just
read
about
the
benefits
of
fairy
literature
i
bethought
me
to
renew
my
acquaintance
with
some
of
those
tales
which
so
often
have
delighted
and
solaced
me
so
i
piled
at
least
twenty
chosen
volumes
on
the
table
at
the
head
of
my
bed
and
i
daresay
it
was
nigh
daylight
when
i
fell
asleep
i
began
my
entertainment
with
several
pages
from
keightley
fairy
mythology
and
followed
it
up
with
random
bits
from

under

i
undertook
the
rescue
of
a
beautiful
princess

had
been
enchanted
by
a
cruel
witch
and
was
kept
in
prison
by
the
witch
son
a
hideous
ogre
with
seven
heads
whose
companions
were
four
equally
hideous
dragons
this
undertaking
in
which
i
was
engaged
involved
a
period
of
five
years
but
time
is
of
precious
little
consideration
to
one
when
he
is
dreaming
of
exploits
achieved
in
behalf
of
a
beautiful
princess
my
fairy
godmother
she
wore
a
and
was
hunchbacked
took
good
care
of
me
and
conducted
me
safely
through
all
my
encounters
with
demons
giants
dragons
witches
serpents
hippogriffins
ogres
etc
and
i
had
just
rescued
the
princess
and
broken
the
spell
which
bound
her
and
we
were
about
to
live
in
peace
to
the
end
of
our
lives
when
i
awoke
to
find
it
was
all
a
dream
and
that
the
over
my
bed
had
been
blazing
away
during
the
entire
period
of
my
war
for
the
delectable
maiden
this
incident
gives
me
an
opportunity
to
say
that
observation
has
convinced
me
that
all
good
and
true
practise
the
pleasing
and
improving
avocation
of
reading
in
bed
indeed
i
fully
believe
with
judge
methuen
that
no
book
can
be
appreciated
until
it
has
been
slept
with
and
dreamed
over
you
recall
perhaps
that
eloquent
passage
in
his
noble
defence
of
the
poet
archias
wherein
cicero
not
kikero
refers
to
his
own
pursuit
of
literary
studies
haec
studia
adolescentiam
alunt
senectutem
oblectant
secundas
res
ornant
adversis
perfugium
ac
solatium
praebent
delectant
domi
non
impediunt
foris
pernoctant
nobiscum
peregrinantur
rusticantur
by
the
gods
you
spoke
tally
friend
cicero
for
it
is
indeed
so
that
these
pursuits
nourish
our
earlier
and
delight
our
later
years
dignifying
the
minor
details
of
life
and
affording
a
perennial
refuge
and
solace
at
home
they
please
us
and
in
no
vocation
elsewhere
do
they
embarrass
us
they
are
with
us
by
night
they
go
with
us
upon
our
travels
and
even
upon
our
retirement
into
the
country
do
they
accompany
us
i
have
italicized
pernoctant
because
it
is
that
word
which
demonstrates
beyond
all
possibility
of
doubt
that
cicero
made
a
practice
of
reading
in
bed
why
i
can
almost
see
him
now
propped
up
in
his
couch
unrolling
scroll
after
scroll
of
his
favorite
literature
and
enjoying
it
mightily
too
which
enjoyment
is
interrupted
now
and
then
by
the
occasion
which
the
noble
reader
takes
to
mutter
maledictions
upon
the
slave
who
has
let
the
lamp
run
low
of
oil
or
has
neglected
to
trim
the
wick
peregrinantur
indeed
they
do
share
our
peregrinations
these
literary
pursuits
do
if
thomas
hearne
of
blessed
memory
were
alive
he
would
tell
us
that
he
used
always
to
take
a
book
along
with
him
whenever
he
went
walking
and
was
wont
to
read
it
as
he
strolled
along
on
several
occasions
as
he
tells
us
in
his
diary
he
became
so
absorbed
in
his
reading
that
he
missed
his
way
and
darkness
came
upon
him
before
he
knew
it
i
have
always
wondered
why
have
not
had
more
to
say
of
hearne
for
assuredly
he
was
as
glorious
a
collector
as
ever
felt
the
divine
fire
glow
within
him
his
character
is
exemplified
in
this
prayer
which
is
preserved
among
other
papers
of
his
in
the
bodleian
library
o
most
gracious
and
merciful
lord
god
wonderful
is
thy
providence
i
return
all
possible
thanks
to
thee
for
the
care
thou
hast
always
taken
of
me
i
continually
meet
with
most
signal
instances
of
this
thy
providence
and
one
act
yesterday
when
i
unexpectedly
met
with
three
old
for
which
in
a
particular
manner
i
return
my
thanks
beseeching
thee
to
continue
the
same
protection
to
me
a
poor
helpless
sinner
etc
another
prayer
of
hearne
illustrative
of
his
faith
in
dependence
upon
divine
counsel
was
made
at
the
time
hearne
was
importuned
by
bray
commissary
to
my
lord
bishop
of
london
to
go
to
in
the
character
of
a
missionary
o
lord
god
heavenly
father
look
down
upon
me
with
pity
cries
this
pious
soul
and
be
pleased
to
be
my
guide
now
i
am
importuned
to
leave
the
place
where
i
have
been
educated
in
the
university
and
of
thy
great
goodness
i
humbly
desire
thee
to
signify
to
me
what
is
most
proper
for
me
to
do
in
this
affair
another
famous
man
who
made
a
practice
of
reading
books
as
he
walked
the
highways
was
johnson
and
it
is
recorded
that
he
presented
a
curious
spectacle
indeed
for
his
shortsightedness
compelled
him
to
hold
the
volume
close
to
his
nose
and
he
shuffled
along
rather
than
walked
stepping
high
over
shadows
and
stumbling
over
sticks
and
stones
but
perhaps
the
most
interesting
story
illustrative
of
the
practice
of
carrying
one
reading
around
with
one
is
that
which
is
told
of
professor
porson
the
greek
scholar
this
human
monument
of
learning
happened
to
be
travelling
in
the
same
coach
with
a
coxcomb
who
sought
to
air
his
pretended
learning
by
quotations
from
the
ancients
at
last
old
porson
asked
sir
whence
comes
that
quotation
from
sophocles
quoth
the
vain
fellow
be
so
kind
as
to
find
it
for
me
asked
porson
producing
a
copy
of
sophocles
from
his
pocket
then
the
coxcomb
not
at
all
abashed
said
that
he
meant
not
sophocles
but
euripides
whereupon
porson
drew
from
another
pocket
a
copy
of
euripides
and
challenged
the
upstart
to
find
the
quotation
in
question
full
of
confusion
the
fellow
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
window
of
the
coach
and
cried
to
the
driver
in
heaven
name
put
me
down
at
once
for
there
is
an
old
gentleman
in
here
that
hath
the
bodleian
library
in
his
pocket
porson
himself
was
a
veritable
slave
to
the
habit
of
reading
in
bed
he
would
lie
down
with
his
books
piled
around
him
then
light
his
pipe
and
start
in
upon
some
favorite
volume
a
jug
of
liquor
was
invariably
at
hand
for
porson
was
a
famous
drinker
it
is
related
that
on
one
occasion
he
fell
into
a
boosy
slumber
his
pipe
dropped
out
of
his
mouth
and
set
fire
to
the
but
for
the
arrival
of
succor
the
tipsy
scholar
would
surely
have
been
cremated
another
very
slovenly
fellow
was
de
quincey
and
he
was
devoted
to
reading
in
bed
but
de
quincey
was
a
very
vandal
when
it
came
to
the
care
and
use
of
books
he
never
returned
volumes
he
borrowed
and
he
never
hesitated
to
mutilate
a
rare
book
in
order
to
save
himself
the
labor
and
trouble
of
writing
out
a
quotation
but
perhaps
the
person
who
did
most
to
bring
reading
in
bed
into
evil
repute
was
charles
elstob
ward
and
sister
of
the
canon
of
canterbury
circa
in
his
dissertation
on
rowe
mores
describes
this
woman
as
the
indefessa
comes
of
her
brother
studies
a
female
student
in
oxford
she
was
says
mores
a
northern
lady
of
an
ancient
family
and
a
genteel
fortune
but
she
pursued
too
much
the
drug
called
learning
and
in
that
pursuit
failed
of
being
careful
of
any
one
thing
necessary
in
her
latter
years
she
was
tutoress
in
the
family
of
the
duke
of
portland
where
we
visited
her
in
her
at
bulstrode
surrounded
with
books
and
dirtiness
the
usual
appendages
of
folk
of
learning
there
is
another
word
which
cicero
uses
for
i
have
still
somewhat
more
to
say
of
that
passage
from
the
oration
pro
archia
poeta
the
word
rusticantur
which
indicates
that
civilization
twenty
centuries
ago
made
a
practice
of
taking
books
out
into
the
country
for
summer
reading
these
literary
pursuits
rusticate
with
us
says
cicero
and
thus
he
presents
to
us
a
of
the
roman
patrician
stretched
upon
the
cool
grass
under
the
trees
perusing
the
latest
popular
romance
while
forsooth
in
yonder
hammock
his
dignified
spouse
swings
slowly
to
and
fro
conning
the
pages
and
the
colored
plates
of
the
current
fashion
journal
surely
in
the
telltale
word
rusticantur
you
and
i
and
the
rest
of
human
nature
find
a
worthy
precedent
and
much
encouragement
for
our
practice
of
loading
up
with
plenty
of
good
reading
before
we
start
for
the
scene
of
our
annual
summering
as
for
myself
i
never
go
away
from
home
that
i
do
not
take
a
trunkful
of
books
with
me
for
experience
has
taught
me
that
there
is
no
companionship
better
than
that
of
these
friends
who
however
much
all
things
else
may
vary
always
give
the
same
response
to
my
demand
upon
their
solace
and
their
cheer
my
sister
miss
susan
has
often
inveighed
against
this
practice
of
mine
and
it
was
only
yesterday
that
she
informed
me
that
i
was
the
most
exasperating
man
in
the
world
however
as
miss
susan
experience
with
men
during
the
hot
summers
and
hard
winters
of
her
life
has
been
somewhat
limited
i
think
i
should
bear
her
criticism
without
a
murmur
miss
susan
is
really
one
of
the
kindest
creatures
in
all
the
world
it
is
her
misfortune
that
she
has
had
all
her
life
an
insane
passion
for
collecting
crockery
old
pewter
old
brass
old
glass
old
furniture
and
other
trumpery
of
that
character
a
passion
with
which
i
have
little
sympathy
i
do
not
know
that
miss
susan
is
prouder
of
her
collection
of
all
this
folderol
than
she
is
of
the
fact
that
she
is
a
spinster
this
latter
peculiarity
asserts
itself
upon
every
occasion
possible
i
recall
an
unpleasant
scene
in
the
omnibus
last
winter
when
the
obsequious
conductor
taking
advantage
of
my
sister
white
hair
and
furrowed
cheeks
addressed
that
estimable
lady
as
madam
i
have
you
know
that
my
sister
gave
the
fellow
to
understand
very
shortly
and
in
very
vigorous
english
emphasized
with
her
blue
silk
umbrella
that
she
was
miss
susan
and
that
she
did
not
intend
to
be
madamed
by
anybody
under
any
condition
iv
the
mania
of
collecting
seizes
me
captivity
waite
never
approved
of
my
fondness
for
fairy
literature
she
shared
the
enthusiasm
which
i
expressed
whenever
robinson
crusoe
was
mentioned
there
was
just
enough
seriousness
in
de
foe
romance
just
enough
piety
to
appeal
for
sympathy
to
one
of
captivity
religious
turn
of
mind
when
it
came
to
fiction
involving
witches
ogres
and
flubdubs
that
was
too
much
for
captivity
and
the
spirit
of
the
little
puritan
revolted
yet
i
have
the
documentary
evidence
to
prove
that
captivity
ancestors
both
paternal
and
maternal
were
in
the
palmy
colonial
times
as
abject
slaves
to
superstition
as
could
well
be
imagined
the
waites
of
salem
were
famous
persecutors
of
witches
and
sinai
higginbotham
captivity
on
her
mother
side
of
the
family
was
cotton
mather
boon
companion
and
rode
around
the
gallows
with
that
zealous
theologian
on
that
memorable
occasion
when
five
young
women
were
hanged
at
danvers
upon
the
charge
of
having
tormented
little
children
with
their
damnable
arts
of
witchcraft
human
thought
is
like
a
monstrous
pendulum
it
keeps
swinging
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
within
the
compass
of
five
generations
we
find
the
puritan
first
an
uncompromising
believer
in
demonology
and
magic
and
then
a
scoffer
at
everything
involving
the
play
of
fancy
i
felt
harshly
toward
captivity
waite
for
a
time
but
i
harbor
her
no
now
on
the
contrary
i
recall
with
very
tender
feelings
the
distant
time
when
our
sympathies
were
the
same
and
when
we
journeyed
the
pathway
of
early
youth
in
a
companionship
sanctified
by
the
innocence
and
the
loyalty
and
the
truth
of
childhood
indeed
i
am
not
sure
that
that
early
friendship
did
not
make
a
lasting
impression
upon
my
life
i
have
thought
of
captivity
waite
a
great
many
times
and
i
have
not
unfrequently
wondered
what
might
have
been
but
for
that
book
of
fairy
tales
which
my
uncle
cephas
sent
me
she
was
a
very
pretty
child
and
she
lost
none
of
her
comeliness
and
none
of
her
sweetness
of
character
as
she
approached
maturity
i
was
impressed
with
this
upon
my
return
from
college
she
too
had
pursued
those
studies
deemed
necessary
to
the
acquirement
of
a
good
education
she
had
taken
a
four
years
course
at
south
holyoke
and
had
finished
at
willard
seminary
at
troy
you
will
now
said
her
father
and
he
voiced
the
new
england
sentiment
regarding
young
womanhood
you
will
now
return
to
the
quiet
of
your
home
and
under
the
direction
of
your
mother
study
the
performance
of
those
weightier
duties
which
qualify
your
sex
for
a
realization
of
the
solemn
responsibilities
of
human
life
three
or
four
years
ago
a
young
fellow
walked
in
upon
me
with
a
letter
of
introduction
from
his
mother
he
was
captivity
waite
son
captivity
is
a
widow
now
and
she
is
still
living
in
her
native
state
within
twenty
miles
of
the
spot
where
she
was
born
colonel
parker
her
husband
left
her
a
good
property
when
he
died
and
she
is
famous
for
her
charities
she
has
founded
a
village
library
and
she
has
written
me
on
several
occasions
for
advice
upon
proposed
purchases
of
books
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
had
a
good
deal
of
malicious
pleasure
in
sending
her
not
long
ago
a
reminder
of
old
times
in
these
words
my
valued
friend
i
wrote
i
see
by
the
catalogue
recently
published
that
your
village
library
contains
among
other
volumes
representing
the
modern
school
of
fiction
eleven
copies
of
and
six
copies
of
heavenly
twins
i
also
note
an
absence
of
certain
works
whose
influence
upon
my
earlier
life
was
such
that
i
make
bold
to
send
copies
of
the
same
to
your
care
in
the
hope
that
you
will
kindly
present
them
to
the
library
with
my
most
cordial
compliments
these
are
a
copy
each
of
the
england
primer
and
grimm
stories
at
the
age
of
having
been
graduated
from
college
and
having
read
the
poems
of
villon
the
confessions
of
rousseau
and
boswell
life
of
johnson
i
was
convinced
that
i
had
comprehended
the
sum
of
human
wisdom
and
knew
all
there
was
worth
knowing
if
at
the
present
time
for
i
am
i
knew
as
much
as
i
thought
i
knew
at
i
should
undoubtedly
be
a
prodigy
of
learning
and
wisdom
i
started
out
to
be
a
philosopher
my
grandmother
death
during
my
second
year
at
college
possessed
me
of
a
considerable
sum
of
money
and
severed
every
tie
and
sentimental
obligation
which
had
previously
held
me
to
my
grandmother
wish
that
i
become
a
minister
of
the
gospel
when
i
became
convinced
that
i
knew
everything
i
conceived
a
desire
to
see
something
for
i
had
traveled
none
and
i
had
met
but
few
people
upon
the
advice
of
my
uncle
cephas
i
made
a
journey
to
europe
and
devoted
two
years
to
seeing
sights
and
to
acquainting
myself
with
the
people
and
the
customs
abroad
nine
months
of
this
time
i
spent
in
paris
which
was
then
an
irregular
and
unkempt
city
but
withal
quite
as
evil
as
at
present
i
took
apartments
in
the
latin
quarter
and
being
of
a
generous
nature
i
devoted
a
large
share
of
my
income
to
the
support
of
certain
artists
and
students
whose
talents
and
time
were
expended
almost
exclusively
in
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
while
thus
serving
as
a
visible
means
of
support
to
this
horde
of
parasites
i
fell
in
with
the
man
who
has
since
then
been
my
intimate
friend
judge
methuen
was
a
visitor
in
paris
and
we
became
boon
companions
it
was
he
who
rescued
me
from
the
parasites
and
revived
the
flames
of
honorable
ambition
which
had
been
extinguished
by
the
wretched
influence
of
villon
and
rousseau
the
judge
was
a
year
my
senior
and
a
wealthy
father
provided
him
with
the
means
for
gratifying
his
wholesome
and
refined
tastes
we
two
went
together
to
london
and
it
was
during
our
sojourn
in
that
capital
that
i
began
my
career
as
a
collector
of
books
it
is
simply
justice
to
my
benefactor
to
say
that
to
my
dear
friend
methuen
i
am
indebted
for
the
inspiration
which
started
me
upon
a
course
so
full
of
sweet
surprises
and
precious
rewards
there
are
very
many
kinds
of
book
collectors
but
i
think
all
may
be
grouped
in
three
classes
viz
those
who
collect
from
vanity
those
who
collect
for
the
benefits
of
learning
those
who
collect
through
a
veneration
and
love
for
books
it
is
not
unfrequent
that
men
who
begin
to
collect
books
merely
to
gratify
their
personal
vanity
find
themselves
presently
so
much
in
love
with
the
pursuit
that
they
become
collectors
in
the
better
sense
just
as
a
man
who
takes
pleasure
in
the
conquest
of
feminine
hearts
invariably
finds
himself
at
last
ensnared
by
the
very
passion
which
he
has
been
using
simply
for
the
gratification
of
his
vanity
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
element
of
vanity
enters
to
a
degree
into
every
phase
of
book
collecting
vanity
is
i
take
it
one
of
the
essentials
to
a
character
not
a
prodigious
vanity
but
a
prudent
one
but
for
vanity
there
would
be
no
competition
in
the
world
without
competition
there
would
be
no
progress
in
these
later
days
i
often
hear
this
man
or
that
sneered
at
because
forsooth
he
collects
books
without
knowing
what
the
books
are
about
but
for
my
part
i
say
that
that
man
bids
fair
to
be
all
right
he
has
made
a
proper
start
in
the
right
direction
and
the
likelihood
is
that
other
things
being
equal
he
will
eventually
become
a
lover
as
well
as
a
buyer
of
books
indeed
i
care
not
what
the
beginning
is
so
long
as
it
be
a
beginning
there
are
different
ways
of
reaching
the
goal
some
folk
go
horseback
via
the
royal
road
but
very
many
others
are
compelled
to
adopt
the
more
tedious
processes
involving
rocky
pathways
and
torn
shoon
and
sore
feet
so
subtile
and
so
infectious
is
this
grand
passion
that
one
is
hardly
aware
of
its
presence
before
it
has
complete
possession
of
him
and
i
have
known
instances
of
men
who
after
having
associated
one
evening
with
judge
methuen
and
me
have
waked
up
the
next
morning
filled
with
the
incurable
enthusiasm
of
bibliomania
but
the
development
of
the
passion
is
not
always
marked
by
exhibitions
of
violence
sometimes
like
the
measles
it
is
slow
and
obstinate
about
coming
out
and
in
such
cases
applications
should
be
resorted
to
for
the
purpose
of
diverting
the
malady
from
the
vitals
otherwise
serious
results
may
ensue
indeed
my
learned
friend
has
met
with
several
cases
as
he
informs
me
in
which
suppressed
bibliomania
has
resulted
fatally
many
of
these
cases
have
been
reported
in
that
excellent
publication
the
journal
of
the
american
medical
association
which
periodical
by
the
way
is
edited
by
hamilton
a
famous
collector
of
the
literature
of
ornament
and
dress
to
make
short
of
a
long
story
the
medical
faculty
is
nearly
a
unit
upon
the
proposition
that
wherever
suppressed
bibliomania
is
suspected
immediate
steps
should
be
taken
to
bring
out
the
disease
it
is
true
that
an
ohio
physician
named
woodbury
has
written
much
in
defence
of
the
theory
that
bibliomania
can
be
aborted
but
a
very
large
majority
of
his
profession
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
actual
malady
must
needs
run
a
regular
course
and
they
insist
that
the
cases
quoted
as
cured
by
woodbury
were
not
genuine
but
were
bastard
or
false
phases
of
the
same
class
as
the
chickenpox
and
the
german
measles
my
mania
exhibited
itself
first
in
an
affectation
for
old
books
it
mattered
not
what
the
book
itself
was
so
long
as
it
bore
an
ancient
date
upon
its
or
in
its
colophon
i
pined
to
possess
it
this
was
not
only
a
vanity
but
a
very
silly
one
in
a
month
time
i
had
got
together
a
large
number
of
these
old
tomes
many
of
them
folios
and
nearly
all
badly
and
sadly
shaken
one
day
i
entered
a
shop
kept
by
a
man
named
stibbs
and
asked
if
i
could
procure
any
volumes
of
print
yes
said
stibbs
we
have
a
cellarful
of
them
and
we
sell
them
by
the
ton
or
by
the
cord
that
very
day
i
dispersed
my
hoard
of
antiques
retaining
only
my
prynne
and
my
opera
quinti
horatii
flacci
aldus
venetiis
and
then
i
became
interested
in
british
balladry
a
noble
subject
for
which
i
have
always
had
a
veneration
and
love
as
the
and
profusely
annotated
volumes
in
cases
and
in
the
front
room
are
ready
to
prove
to
you
at
any
time
you
choose
to
visit
my
quiet
pleasant
home
v
baldness
and
intellectuality
one
of
judge
methuen
pet
theories
is
that
the
soul
in
the
human
body
lies
near
the
center
of
gravity
this
is
i
believe
one
of
the
tenets
of
the
buddhist
faith
and
for
a
long
time
i
eschewed
it
as
one
might
shun
a
vile
thing
for
i
feared
lest
i
should
become
identified
even
remotely
with
any
faith
or
sect
other
than
congregationalism
yet
i
noticed
that
in
moments
of
fear
or
of
joy
or
of
the
sense
of
any
other
emotion
i
invariably
experienced
a
feeling
of
goneness
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
as
if
forsooth
the
center
of
my
physical
system
were
also
the
center
of
my
nervous
and
intellectual
system
the
point
at
which
were
focused
all
those
devious
lines
of
communication
by
means
of
which
sensation
is
instantaneously
transmitted
from
one
part
of
the
body
to
another
i
mentioned
this
circumstance
to
judge
methuen
and
it
seemed
to
please
him
my
friend
said
he
you
have
a
particularly
sensitive
soul
i
beg
of
you
to
exercise
the
greatest
prudence
in
your
treatment
of
it
it
is
the
best
type
of
the
bibliomaniac
soul
for
the
quickness
of
its
apprehensions
betokens
that
it
is
alert
and
keen
and
capable
of
instantaneous
impressions
and
enthusiasms
what
you
have
just
told
me
convinces
me
that
you
are
by
nature
qualified
for
rare
exploits
in
the
science
and
art
of
you
will
presently
become
bald
perhaps
as
bald
as
thomas
hobbes
was
for
a
vigilant
and
active
soul
invariably
compels
baldness
so
close
are
the
relations
between
the
soul
and
the
brain
and
so
destructive
are
the
growth
and
operations
of
the
soul
to
those
vestigial
features
which
humanity
has
inherited
from
those
grosser
animals
our
prehistoric
ancestors
you
see
by
this
that
judge
methuen
recognized
baldness
as
evidence
of
intellectuality
and
spirituality
he
has
collected
much
literature
upon
the
subject
and
has
promised
the
academy
of
science
to
prepare
and
read
for
the
instruction
of
that
learned
body
an
essay
demonstrating
that
absence
of
hair
from
the
cranium
particularly
from
the
superior
regions
of
the
frontal
and
parietal
divisions
proves
a
departure
from
the
instincts
and
practices
of
brute
humanity
and
indicates
surely
the
growth
of
the
understanding
it
occurred
to
the
judge
long
ago
to
prepare
a
list
of
the
names
of
the
famous
bald
men
in
the
history
of
human
society
and
this
list
has
grown
until
it
includes
the
names
of
thousands
representing
every
profession
and
vocation
homer
socrates
confucius
aristotle
plato
cicero
pliny
maecenas
julius
caesar
horace
shakespeare
bacon
napoleon
bonaparte
dante
pope
cowper
goldsmith
wordsworth
israel
putnam
john
quincy
adams
patrick
henry
these
geniuses
all
were
bald
but
the
baldest
of
all
was
the
philosopher
hobbes
of
whom
the
revered
john
aubrey
has
recorded
that
he
was
very
bald
yet
within
dore
he
used
to
study
and
sitt
and
said
he
never
took
cold
in
his
head
but
that
the
greatest
trouble
was
to
keepe
off
the
flies
from
pitching
on
the
baldness
in
all
the
portraits
and
pictures
of
bonaparte
which
i
have
seen
a
conspicuous
feature
is
that
curl
or
lock
of
hair
which
depends
upon
the
emperor
forehead
and
gives
to
the
face
a
pleasant
degree
of
picturesque
distinction
yet
this
was
a
vanity
and
really
a
laughable
one
for
early
in
life
bonaparte
began
to
get
bald
and
this
so
troubled
him
that
he
sought
to
overcome
the
change
it
made
in
his
appearance
by
growing
a
long
strand
of
hair
upon
his
occiput
and
bringing
it
forward
a
goodly
distance
in
such
artful
wise
that
it
right
ingeniously
served
the
purposes
of
that
hyperion
curl
which
had
been
the
pride
of
his
youth
but
which
had
fallen
early
before
the
ravages
of
time
as
for
myself
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
shared
that
derisive
opinion
in
which
the
unthinking
are
wont
to
hold
baldness
nay
on
the
contrary
i
have
always
had
especial
reverence
for
this
mark
of
intellectuality
and
i
agree
with
my
friend
judge
methuen
that
the
tragic
episode
recorded
in
the
second
chapter
of
ii
kings
should
serve
the
honorable
purpose
of
indicating
to
humanity
that
bald
heads
are
favored
with
the
approval
and
the
protection
of
divinity
in
my
own
case
i
have
imputed
my
early
baldness
to
growth
in
intellectuality
and
spirituality
induced
by
my
fondness
for
and
devotion
to
books
miss
susan
my
sister
lays
it
to
other
causes
first
among
which
she
declares
to
be
my
unnatural
practice
of
reading
in
bed
and
the
second
my
habit
of
eating
late
of
nights
over
my
bed
i
have
a
so
properly
shaded
that
the
rays
of
light
are
concentrated
and
reflected
downward
upon
the
volume
which
i
am
reading
miss
susan
insists
that
much
of
this
light
and
its
attendant
heat
falls
upon
my
head
compelling
there
a
dryness
of
the
scalp
whereby
the
follicles
have
been
deprived
of
their
natural
nourishment
and
have
consequently
died
she
furthermore
maintains
that
the
of
which
i
partake
invariably
at
the
eleventh
hour
every
night
breed
poisonous
vapors
and
subtle
megrims
within
my
stomach
which
humors
rising
by
their
natural
courses
to
my
brain
do
therein
produce
a
fever
that
from
within
burneth
up
the
fluids
necessary
to
a
healthy
condition
of
the
capillary
growth
upon
the
and
exterior
cranial
integument
now
this
very
declaration
of
miss
susan
gives
me
a
potent
argument
in
defence
of
my
practices
for
being
bald
would
not
a
neglect
of
those
means
whereby
warmth
is
engendered
where
it
is
needed
result
in
colds
quinsies
asthmas
and
a
thousand
other
banes
the
same
benignant
providence
which
according
to
laurence
sterne
tempereth
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
provideth
defence
and
protection
for
the
bald
had
i
not
loved
books
the
soul
in
my
midriff
had
not
done
away
with
those
capillary
vestiges
of
my
simian
ancestry
which
originally
flourished
upon
my
scalp
had
i
not
become
bald
the
delights
and
profits
of
reading
in
bed
might
never
have
fallen
to
my
lot
and
indeed
baldness
has
its
compensations
when
i
look
about
me
and
see
the
time
the
energy
and
the
money
that
are
continually
expended
upon
the
nurture
and
tending
of
the
hair
i
am
thankful
that
my
lot
is
what
it
is
for
now
my
money
is
applied
to
the
buying
of
books
and
my
time
and
energy
are
devoted
to
the
reading
of
them
to
thy
vain
employments
thou
becurled
and
pomaded
absalom
sweeter
than
thy
unguents
and
cosmetics
and
sabean
perfumes
is
the
smell
of
those
old
books
of
mine
which
from
the
years
and
from
the
ship
hold
and
from
constant
companionship
with
sages
and
philosophers
have
acquired
a
fragrance
that
exalteth
the
soul
and
quickeneth
the
intellectuals
let
me
paraphrase
my
dear
chaucer
and
tell
thee
thou
waster
of
substances
that
for
me
was
lever
han
at
my
beddes
hed
a
twenty
bokes
clothed
in
black
and
red
of
aristotle
and
his
philosophie
than
robes
rich
or
fidel
or
sautrie
but
all
be
that
i
ben
a
philosopher
yet
have
i
but
litel
gold
in
cofre
books
books
books
give
me
ever
more
books
for
they
are
the
caskets
wherein
we
find
the
immortal
expressions
of
humanity
words
the
only
things
that
live
forever
i
bow
reverently
to
the
bust
in
yonder
corner
whenever
i
recall
what
sir
john
herschel
god
rest
his
dear
soul
said
and
wrote
were
i
to
pay
for
a
taste
that
should
stand
me
in
stead
under
every
variety
of
circumstances
and
be
a
source
of
happiness
and
cheerfulness
to
me
during
life
and
a
shield
against
its
ills
however
things
might
go
amiss
and
the
world
frown
upon
me
it
would
be
a
taste
for
reading
give
a
man
this
taste
and
a
means
of
gratifying
it
and
you
can
hardly
fail
of
making
him
a
happy
man
unless
indeed
you
put
into
his
hands
a
most
perverse
selection
of
books
you
place
him
in
contact
with
the
best
society
in
every
period
of
history
with
the
wisest
the
wittiest
the
tenderest
the
bravest
and
the
purest
characters
who
have
adorned
humanity
you
make
him
a
denizen
of
all
nations
a
contemporary
of
all
ages
the
world
has
been
created
for
him
for
one
phrase
particularly
do
all
good
men
methinks
bless
burly
bearish
old
tom
carlyle
of
all
things
quoth
he
which
men
do
or
make
here
below
by
far
the
most
momentous
wonderful
and
worthy
are
the
things
we
call
books
and
judge
methuen
favorite
quotation
is
from
babington
macaulay
to
this
effect
i
would
rather
be
a
poor
man
in
a
garret
with
plenty
of
books
than
a
king
who
did
not
love
reading
kings
indeed
what
a
sorry
lot
are
they
said
george
iii
to
nicol
his
bookseller
i
would
give
this
right
hand
if
the
same
attention
had
been
paid
to
my
education
which
i
pay
to
that
of
the
prince
louis
xiv
was
as
illiterate
as
the
lowliest
hedger
and
ditcher
he
could
hardly
write
his
name
at
first
as
samuel
pegge
tells
us
he
formed
it
out
of
six
straight
strokes
and
a
line
of
beauty
thus
s
which
he
afterward
perfected
as
best
he
could
and
the
result
was
louis
still
i
find
it
hard
to
inveigh
against
kings
when
i
recall
the
goodness
of
alexander
to
aristotle
for
without
alexander
we
should
hardly
have
known
of
aristotle
his
royal
patron
provided
the
philosopher
with
every
advantage
for
the
acquisition
of
learning
dispatching
couriers
to
all
parts
of
the
earth
to
gather
books
and
manuscripts
and
every
variety
of
curious
thing
likely
to
swell
the
store
of
aristotle
knowledge
yet
set
them
up
in
a
line
and
survey
them
these
wearers
of
crowns
and
these
wielders
of
scepters
and
how
pitiable
are
they
in
the
paucity
and
vanity
of
their
accomplishments
what
knew
they
of
the
true
happiness
of
human
life
they
and
their
courtiers
are
dust
and
forgotten
judge
methuen
and
i
shall
in
due
time
pass
away
but
our
courtiers
they
who
have
ever
contributed
to
our
delight
and
solace
our
horace
our
cervantes
our
shakespeare
and
the
rest
of
the
innumerable
train
these
shall
never
die
and
inspired
and
sustained
by
this
immortal
companionship
we
blithely
walk
the
pathway
illumined
by
its
glory
and
we
sing
in
season
and
out
the
song
ever
dear
to
us
and
ever
dear
to
thee
i
hope
o
gentle
reader
oh
for
a
booke
and
a
shady
nooke
eyther
in
doore
or
out
with
the
greene
leaves
whispering
overhead
or
the
streete
cryes
all
about
where
i
maie
reade
all
at
my
ease
both
of
the
newe
and
old
for
a
jollie
goode
booke
whereon
to
looke
is
better
to
me
than
golde
vi
my
romance
with
fiammetta
my
bookseller
and
i
came
nigh
to
blows
some
months
ago
over
an
edition
of
boccaccio
which
my
bookseller
tried
to
sell
me
this
was
a
copy
in
the
original
published
at
antwerp
in
prettily
rubricated
and
elaborately
adorned
with
some
forty
or
fifty
copperplates
illustrative
of
the
text
i
dare
say
the
volume
was
cheap
enough
at
thirty
dollars
but
i
did
not
want
it
my
reason
for
not
wanting
it
gave
rise
to
that
discussion
between
my
bookseller
and
myself
which
became
very
heated
before
it
ended
i
said
very
frankly
that
i
did
not
care
for
the
book
in
the
original
because
i
had
several
translations
done
by
the
most
competent
hands
thereupon
my
bookseller
ventured
that
aged
and
hackneyed
argument
which
has
for
centuries
done
the
book
trade
such
effective
service
namely
that
in
every
translation
no
matter
how
good
that
translation
may
be
there
is
certain
to
be
lost
a
share
of
the
flavor
and
spirit
of
the
meaning
fiddledeedee
said
i
do
you
suppose
that
these
translators
who
have
devoted
their
lives
to
the
study
and
practice
of
the
art
are
not
competent
to
interpret
the
different
shades
and
colors
of
meaning
better
than
the
mere
dabbler
in
foreign
tongues
and
then
again
is
not
human
life
too
short
for
the
lover
of
books
to
spend
his
precious
time
digging
out
the
recondite
allusions
of
authors
lexicon
in
hand
my
dear
sir
it
is
a
wickedly
false
economy
to
expend
time
and
money
for
that
which
one
can
get
done
much
better
and
at
a
much
smaller
expenditure
by
another
hand
from
my
encounter
with
my
bookseller
i
went
straight
home
and
took
down
my
favorite
copy
of
the
decameron
and
thumbed
it
over
very
tenderly
for
you
must
know
that
i
am
particularly
attached
to
that
little
volume
i
can
hardly
realize
that
nearly
half
a
century
has
elapsed
since
yseult
hardynge
and
i
parted
she
was
such
a
creature
as
the
great
novelist
himself
would
have
chosen
for
a
heroine
she
had
the
beauty
and
the
wit
of
those
florentine
ladies
who
flourished
in
the
fourteenth
century
and
whose
graces
of
body
and
mind
have
been
immortalized
by
boccaccio
her
eyes
as
i
particularly
recall
were
specially
fine
reflecting
from
their
dark
depths
every
expression
of
her
varying
moods
why
i
called
her
fiammetta
i
can
not
say
for
i
do
not
remember
perhaps
from
a
boyish
fancy
merely
at
that
time
boccaccio
and
i
were
famous
friends
we
were
together
constantly
and
his
companionship
had
such
an
influence
upon
me
that
for
the
nonce
i
lived
and
walked
and
had
my
being
in
that
distant
romantic
period
when
all
men
were
gallants
and
all
women
were
grandes
dames
and
all
birds
were
nightingales
i
bought
myself
an
old
florentine
sword
at
noseda
in
the
strand
and
hung
it
on
the
wall
in
my
modest
apartments
under
it
i
placed
boccaccio
portrait
and
fiammetta
and
i
was
wont
to
drink
toasts
to
these
beloved
counterfeit
presentments
in
flagons
mind
you
genuine
antique
flagons
of
italian
wine
twice
i
took
fiammetta
boating
upon
the
thames
and
once
to
view
the
lord
mayor
pageant
her
mother
was
with
us
on
both
occasions
but
she
might
as
well
have
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
for
she
was
a
stupid
old
soul
wholly
incapable
of
sharing
or
appreciating
the
poetic
enthusiasms
of
romantic
youth
had
fiammetta
been
a
book
ah
unfortunate
lady
had
she
but
been
a
book
she
might
still
be
mine
for
me
to
care
for
lovingly
and
to
hide
from
profane
eyes
and
to
attire
in
crushed
levant
and
gold
and
to
cherish
as
a
companion
in
mine
age
had
she
been
a
book
she
could
not
have
been
guilty
of
the
folly
of
wedding
with
a
yeoman
of
lincolnshire
ah
me
what
rude
awakenings
too
often
dispel
the
pleasing
dreams
of
youth
when
i
revisited
england
in
the
sixties
i
was
tempted
to
make
an
excursion
into
lincolnshire
for
the
purpose
of
renewing
my
acquaintance
with
fiammetta
before
however
i
had
achieved
that
object
this
thought
occurred
to
me
you
are
upon
a
fool
errand
turn
back
or
you
will
destroy
forever
one
of
the
sweetest
of
your
boyhood
illusions
you
seek
fiammetta
in
the
delusive
hope
of
finding
her
in
the
person
of
henry
boggs
there
is
but
one
fiammetta
and
she
is
the
memory
abiding
in
your
heart
spare
yourself
the
misery
of
discovering
in
the
hearty
fleshy
lincolnshire
hussif
the
decay
of
the
promises
of
years
ago
be
content
to
do
reverence
to
the
ideal
fiammetta
who
has
built
her
little
shrine
in
your
sympathetic
heart
now
this
was
strange
counsel
yet
it
had
so
great
weight
with
me
that
i
was
persuaded
by
it
and
after
lying
a
night
at
the
tavern
i
went
back
to
london
and
never
again
had
a
desire
to
visit
lincolnshire
but
fiammetta
is
still
a
pleasing
memory
ay
and
more
than
a
memory
to
me
for
whenever
i
take
down
that
precious
book
and
open
it
what
a
host
of
friends
do
troop
forth
cavaliers
princesses
courtiers
damoiselles
monks
nuns
equerries
pages
maidens
humanity
of
every
class
and
condition
and
all
instinct
with
the
color
of
the
master
magician
boccaccio
and
before
them
all
cometh
a
maiden
with
dark
glorious
eyes
and
she
beareth
garlands
of
roses
the
moonlight
falleth
like
a
benediction
upon
the
florentine
garden
slope
and
the
night
wind
seeketh
its
cradle
in
the
laurel
tree
and
fain
would
sleep
to
the
song
of
the
nightingale
as
for
judge
methuen
he
loves
his
boccaccio
quite
as
much
as
i
do
mine
and
being
somewhat
of
a
versifier
he
has
made
a
little
poem
on
the
subject
a
copy
of
which
i
have
secured
surreptitiously
and
do
now
offer
for
your
delectation
one
day
upon
a
topmost
shelf
i
found
a
precious
prize
indeed
which
father
used
to
read
himself
but
did
not
want
us
boys
to
read
a
brown
old
book
of
certain
age
as
type
and
binding
seemed
to
show
while
on
the
spotted
appeared
the
name
boccaccio
i
never
heard
that
name
before
but
in
due
season
it
became
to
him
who
fondly
brooded
those
pages
a
beloved
name
adown
the
centuries
i
walked
mid
pastoral
scenes
and
royal
show
with
seigneurs
and
their
dames
i
talked
the
crony
of
boccaccio
those
courtly
knights
and
sprightly
maids
who
really
seemed
disposed
to
shine
in
gallantries
and
escapades
anon
became
great
friends
of
mine
yet
was
there
sentiment
with
fun
and
oftentimes
my
tears
would
flow
at
some
quaint
tale
of
valor
done
as
told
by
my
boccaccio
in
boyish
dreams
i
saw
again
bucolic
belles
and
dames
of
court
the
princely
youths
and
monkish
men
arrayed
for
sacrifice
or
sport
again
i
heard
the
nightingale
sing
as
she
sang
those
years
ago
in
his
embowered
italian
vale
to
my
revered
boccaccio
and
still
i
love
that
brown
old
book
i
found
upon
the
topmost
shelf
i
love
it
so
i
let
none
look
upon
the
treasure
but
myself
and
yet
i
have
a
strapping
boy
who
i
have
every
cause
to
know
would
to
its
full
extent
enjoy
the
friendship
of
boccaccio
but
boys
are
oh
so
different
now
from
what
they
were
when
i
was
one
i
fear
my
boy
would
not
know
how
to
take
that
old
raconteur
fun
in
your
companionship
o
friend
i
think
it
wise
alone
to
go
plucking
the
gracious
fruits
that
bend
you
lead
boccaccio
so
rest
you
there
upon
the
shelf
clad
in
your
garb
of
faded
brown
perhaps
sometime
my
boy
himself
shall
find
you
out
and
take
you
down
then
may
he
feel
the
joy
once
more
that
thrilled
me
filled
me
years
ago
when
reverently
i
brooded
the
glories
of
boccaccio
out
upon
the
vile
brood
of
imitators
i
say
get
ye
gone
ye
bandellos
and
ye
straparolas
and
ye
other
charlatans
who
would
fain
possess
yourselves
of
the
empire
which
the
genius
of
boccaccio
bequeathed
to
humanity
there
is
but
one
master
and
to
him
we
render
grateful
homage
he
leads
us
down
through
the
cloisters
of
time
and
at
his
touch
the
dead
become
reanimate
and
all
the
sweetness
and
the
valor
of
antiquity
recur
heroism
love
sacrifice
tears
laughter
wisdom
wit
philosophy
charity
and
understanding
are
his
auxiliaries
humanity
is
his
inspiration
humanity
his
theme
humanity
his
audience
humanity
his
debtor
now
it
is
of
tancred
daughter
he
tells
and
now
of
wife
anon
of
the
cozening
gardener
he
speaks
and
anon
of
alibech
of
what
befell
gillette
de
narbonne
of
iphigenia
and
cymon
of
saladin
of
calandrino
of
dianora
and
ansaldo
we
hear
and
what
subject
soever
he
touches
he
quickens
it
into
life
and
he
so
subtly
invests
it
with
that
indefinable
quality
of
his
genius
as
to
attract
thereunto
not
only
our
sympathies
but
also
our
enthusiasm
yes
truly
he
should
be
read
with
understanding
what
author
should
not
i
would
no
more
think
of
putting
my
boccaccio
into
the
hands
of
a
dullard
than
i
would
think
of
leaving
a
bright
and
beautiful
woman
at
the
mercy
of
a
blind
mute
i
have
hinted
at
the
horror
of
the
fate
which
befell
yseult
hardynge
in
the
seclusion
of
henry
boggs
lincolnshire
estate
henry
boggs
knew
nothing
of
romance
and
he
cared
less
he
was
wholly
incapable
of
appreciating
a
woman
with
dark
glorious
eyes
and
an
expanding
soul
i
warrant
me
that
he
would
at
any
time
gladly
have
traded
a
decameron
for
a
copy
of
the
gentleman
poulterer
or
for
a
year
subscription
to
that
grewsome
monument
to
human
imbecility
london
punch
ah
yseult
hadst
thou
but
been
a
book
vii
the
delights
of
i
should
like
to
have
met
izaak
walton
he
is
one
of
the
few
authors
whom
i
know
i
should
like
to
have
met
for
he
was
a
wise
man
and
he
had
understanding
i
should
like
to
have
gone
angling
with
him
for
i
doubt
not
that
like
myself
he
was
more
of
an
angler
theoretically
than
practically
my
bookseller
is
a
famous
fisherman
as
indeed
booksellers
generally
are
since
the
methods
employed
by
fishermen
to
deceive
and
to
catch
their
finny
prey
are
very
similar
to
those
employed
by
booksellers
to
attract
and
to
entrap
buyers
as
for
myself
i
regard
angling
as
one
of
the
best
of
avocations
and
although
i
have
pursued
it
but
little
i
concede
that
doubtless
had
i
practised
it
oftener
i
should
have
been
a
better
man
how
truly
has
dame
juliana
berners
said
that
at
the
least
the
angler
hath
his
wholesome
walk
and
merry
at
his
ease
and
a
sweet
air
of
the
sweet
savour
of
the
mead
flowers
that
maketh
him
hungry
he
heareth
the
melodious
harmony
of
fowls
he
seeth
the
young
swans
herons
ducks
cotes
and
many
other
fowls
with
their
broods
which
meseemeth
better
than
all
the
noise
of
hounds
the
blasts
of
horns
and
the
cry
of
fowls
that
hunters
falconers
and
fowlers
can
make
and
if
the
angler
take
fish
surely
then
is
there
no
man
merrier
than
he
is
in
his
spirit
my
bookseller
can
not
understand
how
it
is
that
being
so
enthusiastic
a
fisherman
theoretically
i
should
at
the
same
time
indulge
so
seldom
in
the
practice
of
fishing
as
if
forsooth
a
man
should
be
expected
to
engage
continually
and
actively
in
every
art
and
practice
of
which
he
may
happen
to
approve
my
young
friend
edward
ayer
has
a
noble
collection
of
books
relating
to
the
history
of
american
aboriginals
and
to
the
wars
waged
between
those
indians
and
the
settlers
in
this
country
my
other
young
friend
luther
mills
has
gathered
together
a
multitude
of
books
treating
of
the
napoleonic
wars
yet
neither
ayer
nor
mills
hath
ever
slain
a
man
or
fought
a
battle
albeit
both
find
delectation
in
recitals
of
warlike
prowess
and
personal
valor
i
love
the
night
and
all
the
poetic
influences
of
that
quiet
time
but
i
do
not
sit
up
all
night
in
order
to
hear
the
nightingale
or
to
contemplate
the
astounding
glories
of
the
heavens
for
similar
reasons
much
as
i
appreciate
and
marvel
at
the
beauties
of
early
morning
i
do
not
make
a
practice
of
early
rising
and
sensible
as
i
am
to
the
charms
of
the
babbling
brook
and
of
the
crystal
lake
i
am
not
addicted
to
the
practice
of
wading
about
in
either
to
the
danger
either
to
my
own
health
or
to
the
health
of
the
finny
denizens
in
those
places
the
best
anglers
in
the
world
are
those
who
do
not
catch
fish
the
mere
slaughter
of
fish
is
simply
brutal
and
it
was
with
a
view
to
keeping
her
excellent
treatise
out
of
the
hands
of
the
idle
and
the
inappreciative
that
dame
berners
incorporated
that
treatise
in
a
compendious
book
whose
cost
was
so
large
that
only
gentyll
and
noble
men
could
possess
it
what
mind
has
he
who
loveth
fishing
merely
for
the
killing
it
involves
what
mind
has
such
a
one
to
the
beauty
of
the
panorama
which
nature
unfolds
to
the
appreciative
eye
or
what
communion
has
he
with
those
sweet
and
uplifting
influences
in
which
the
meadows
the
hillsides
the
glades
the
dells
the
forests
and
the
marshes
abound
out
upon
these
vandals
i
say
out
upon
the
barbarians
who
would
rob
angling
of
its
poesy
and
reduce
it
to
the
level
of
the
trade
it
becomes
a
base
and
vicious
avocation
does
angling
when
it
ceases
to
be
what
sir
henry
wotton
loved
to
call
it
an
employment
for
his
idle
time
which
was
then
not
idly
spent
a
rest
to
his
mind
a
cheerer
of
his
spirits
a
diverter
of
sadness
a
calmer
of
unquiet
thoughts
a
moderator
of
passions
a
procurer
of
contentedness
and
a
begetter
of
habits
of
peace
and
patience
in
those
that
professed
and
practised
it
there
was
another
man
i
should
like
to
have
met
sir
henry
wotton
for
he
was
an
ideal
angler
christopher
north
too
an
excellent
angler
and
now
with
god
how
i
should
love
to
have
explored
the
yarrow
with
him
for
he
was
a
man
of
vast
soul
vast
learning
and
vast
wit
would
you
believe
it
my
dear
shepherd
said
he
that
my
piscatory
passions
are
almost
dead
within
me
and
i
like
now
to
saunter
along
the
banks
and
braes
eying
the
younkers
angling
or
to
lay
me
down
on
some
sunny
spot
and
with
my
face
up
to
heaven
watch
the
clouds
there
was
the
angling
genius
with
whom
i
would
fain
go
angling
angling
says
our
revered
izaak
angling
is
somewhat
like
poetry
men
are
to
be
born
so
doubtless
there
are
poets
who
are
not
anglers
but
doubtless
there
never
was
an
angler
who
was
not
also
a
poet
christopher
north
was
a
famous
fisherman
he
began
his
career
as
such
when
he
was
a
child
of
three
years
with
his
thread
line
and
hook
the
wee
tot
set
out
to
make
his
first
cast
in
a
wee
burnie
he
had
discovered
near
his
home
he
caught
his
fish
too
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
he
carried
the
miserable
little
specimen
about
on
a
plate
exhibiting
it
triumphantly
with
that
first
experience
began
a
life
which
i
am
fain
to
regard
as
one
glorious
song
in
praise
of
the
beauty
and
the
beneficence
of
nature
my
bookseller
once
took
me
angling
with
him
in
a
wisconsin
lake
which
was
the
property
of
a
club
of
anglers
to
which
my
friend
belonged
as
we
were
to
be
absent
several
days
i
carried
along
a
box
of
books
for
i
esteem
appropriate
reading
to
be
a
most
important
adjunct
to
an
angling
expedition
my
bookseller
had
with
him
enough
machinery
to
stock
a
whaling
expedition
and
i
could
not
help
wondering
what
my
old
walton
would
think
could
he
drop
down
into
our
company
with
his
modest
equipment
of
hooks
flies
and
gentles
the
lake
whither
we
went
was
a
large
and
beautiful
expanse
girt
by
a
landscape
which
to
my
fancy
was
the
embodiment
of
poetic
delicacy
and
suggestion
i
began
to
inquire
about
the
chub
dace
and
trouts
but
my
bookseller
lost
no
time
in
telling
me
that
the
lake
had
been
rid
of
all
cheap
fry
and
had
been
stocked
with
game
fish
such
as
bass
and
pike
i
did
not
at
all
relish
this
covert
sneer
at
traditions
which
i
have
always
reverenced
and
the
better
acquainted
i
became
with
my
bookseller
modern
art
of
angling
the
less
i
liked
it
i
have
little
love
for
that
kind
of
angling
which
does
not
admit
of
a
simultaneous
enjoyment
of
the
surrounding
beauties
of
nature
my
bookseller
enjoined
silence
upon
me
but
i
did
not
heed
the
injunction
for
i
must
indeed
have
been
a
mere
wooden
effigy
to
hold
my
peace
amid
that
picturesque
environment
of
hill
valley
wood
meadow
and
arching
sky
of
clear
blue
it
was
fortunate
for
me
that
i
had
my
noctes
ambrosianae
along
for
when
i
had
exhausted
my
praise
of
the
surrounding
glories
of
nature
my
bookseller
would
not
converse
with
me
so
i
opened
my
book
and
read
to
him
that
famous
passage
between
kit
north
and
the
ettrick
shepherd
wherein
the
shepherd
discourses
boastfully
of
his
prowess
as
a
piscator
of
sawmon
as
the
sun
approached
midheaven
and
its
heat
became
insupportable
i
raised
my
umbrella
to
this
sensible
proceeding
my
bookseller
objected
in
fact
there
was
hardly
any
reasonable
suggestion
i
had
to
make
for
beguiling
the
time
that
my
bookseller
did
not
protest
against
it
and
when
finally
i
produced
my
newcastle
fisher
garlands
from
my
basket
and
began
to
troll
those
spirited
lines
beginning
away
wi
carking
care
and
gloom
that
make
life
pathway
weedy
o
a
cheerful
glass
makes
flowers
to
bloom
and
lightsome
hours
fly
speedy
o
he
gathered
in
his
rod
and
tackle
and
declared
that
it
was
no
use
trying
to
catch
fish
while
bedlam
ran
riot
as
for
me
i
had
a
delightful
time
of
it
i
caught
no
fish
to
be
sure
but
what
of
that
i
could
have
caught
fish
had
i
so
desired
but
as
i
have
already
intimated
to
you
and
as
i
have
always
maintained
and
always
shall
the
mere
catching
of
fish
is
the
least
of
the
many
enjoyments
comprehended
in
the
broad
gracious
art
of
angling
even
my
bookseller
was
compelled
to
admit
ultimately
that
i
was
a
worthy
disciple
of
walton
for
when
we
had
returned
to
the
club
house
and
had
partaken
of
our
supper
i
regaled
the
company
with
many
a
cheery
tale
and
merry
song
which
i
had
gathered
from
my
books
indeed
before
i
returned
to
the
city
i
was
elected
an
honorary
member
of
the
club
by
acclamation
not
for
the
number
of
fish
i
had
expiscated
for
i
did
not
catch
one
but
for
that
mastery
of
the
science
of
angling
and
the
literature
and
the
traditions
and
the
religion
and
the
philosophy
thereof
which
by
the
grace
of
the
companionship
of
books
i
had
achieved
it
is
said
that
with
his
feet
over
the
fender
macaulay
could
discourse
learnedly
of
french
poetry
art
and
philosophy
yet
he
never
visited
paris
that
he
did
not
experience
the
most
exasperating
difficulties
in
making
himself
understood
by
the
french
customs
officers
in
like
manner
i
am
a
with
my
shins
toasting
before
a
roaring
fire
and
with
judge
methuen
at
my
side
i
love
to
exploit
the
joys
and
the
glories
of
angling
the
judge
is
a
brother
of
the
angle
as
all
will
allow
who
have
heard
him
tell
father
prout
story
of
the
bishop
and
the
turbots
or
heard
him
sing
with
angle
rod
and
lightsome
heart
our
conscience
clear
we
gay
depart
to
pebbly
brooks
and
purling
streams
and
a
care
to
vex
our
dreams
and
how
could
the
lot
of
the
be
happier
no
colds
quinsies
or
asthmas
follow
his
incursions
into
the
realms
of
fancy
where
in
cool
streams
and
peaceful
lakes
a
legion
of
chubs
and
trouts
and
sawmon
await
him
in
fancy
he
can
hie
away
to
the
yalrow
and
once
more
share
the
benefits
of
the
companionship
of
kit
north
the
shepherd
and
that
noble
edinburgh
band
in
fancy
he
can
trudge
the
banks
of
the
blackwater
with
the
sage
of
watergrasshill
in
fancy
he
can
hear
the
music
of
the
tyne
and
feel
the
wind
sweep
cool
and
fresh
coquetdale
in
fancy
too
he
knows
the
friendships
which
only
he
can
know
the
friendships
of
the
immortals
whose
spirits
hover
where
human
love
and
sympathy
attract
them
how
well

lovingly

thou
remember
how
i
found
thee
half
a
century
ago
all
tumbled
in
a
lot
of
paltry
trash
did
i
not
joyously
possess
thee
for
a
sixpence
and
have
i
not
cherished
thee
full
sweetly

viii
ballads
and
their
makers
one
of
the
most
interesting
spots
in
all
london
to
me
is
bunhill
fields
cemetery
for
herein
are
the
graves
of
many
whose
memory
i
revere
i
had
heard
that
joseph
ritson
was
buried
here
and
while
my
sister
miss
susan
lingered
at
the
grave
of
her
favorite
poet
i
took
occasion
to
spy
around
among
the
tombstones
in
the
hope
of
discovering
the
last
of
the
curious
old
antiquary
whose
labors
in
the
field
of
balladry
have
placed
me
under
so
great
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
him
but
after
i
had
searched
in
vain
for
somewhat
more
than
an
hour
one
of
the
keepers
of
the
place
told
me
that
in
compliance
with
earnest
desire
while
living
that
antiquary
grave
was
immediately
after
the
interment
of
the
body
levelled
down
and
left
to
the
care
of
nature
with
no
stone
to
designate
its
location
so
at
the
present
time
no
one
knows
just
where
old
ritson
grave
is
only
that
within
that
vast
enclosure
where
so
many
thousand
souls
sleep
their
last
sleep
the
dust
of
the
famous
lies
fast
asleep
in
the
bosom
of
mother
earth
i
have
never
been
able
to
awaken
in
miss
susan
any
enthusiasm
for
balladry
my
worthy
sister
is
of
a
serious
turn
of
mind
and
i
have
heard
her
say
a
thousand
times
that
convivial
songs
which
is
her
name
for
balladry
are
inspirations
if
not
actually
compositions
of
the
devil
in
her
younger
days
miss
susan
performed
upon
the
melodeon
with
much
discretion
and
at
one
time
i
indulged
the
delusive
hope
that
eventually
she
would
not
disdain
to
join
me
in
the
vocal
performance
of
the
best
ditties
of
and
his
ilk
if
i
do
say
it
myself
i
had
a
very
pretty
voice
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
and
even
at
the
present
time
i
can
deliver
the
ballad
of
king
cophetua
and
the
beggar
maid
with
amazing
spirit
when
i
have
my
friend
judge
methuen
at
my
side
and
a
bowl
of
steaming
punch
between
us
but
my
education
of
miss
susan
ended
without
being
finished
we
two
learned
to
perform
the
ballad
of
sir
patrick
spens
very
acceptably
but
miss
susan
abandoned
the
copartnership
when
i
insisted
that
we
proceed
to
the
sprightly
ditty
beginning
life
short
hours
too
fast
are
hasting
sweet
amours
can
not
be
lasting
my
physician
has
often
told
me
that
he
who
has
a
ballad
library
should
never
be
lonely
for
the
limitations
of
balladly
are
so
broad
that
within
them
are
to
be
found
performances
adapted
to
every
mood
to
which
humanity
is
liable
and
indeed
my
experience
confirms
the
truth
of
my
physician
theory
it
were
hard
for
me
to
tell
what
delight
i
have
had
upon
a
hot
and
gusty
day
in
a
perusal
of
the
history
of
robin
hood
for
there
is
such
actuality
in
those
simple
rhymes
as
to
dispel
the
troublesome
environments
of
the
present
and
transport
me
to
better
times
and
pleasanter
scenes
aha
how
many
times
have
i
walked
with
brave
robin
in
sherwood
forest
how
many
times
have
little
john
and
i
couched
under
the
greenwood
tree
and
shared
with
friar
tuck
the
haunch
of
juicy
venison
and
the
pottle
of
brown
october
brew
and
will
scarlet
and
i
have
been
famous
friends
these
many
a
year
and
if
were
here
he
would
tell
you
that
i
have
trolled
full
many
a
ballad
with
him
in
praise
of
maid
peerless
beauty
who
says
that
sherwood
is
no
more
and
that
robin
and
his
merry
men
are
gone
forever
why
only
yesternight
i
walked
with
them
in
that
gracious
forest
and
laughed
defiance
at
the
doughty
sheriff
and
his
craven
menials
the
moonlight
twinkled
and
sifted
through
the
boscage
and
the
wind
was
fresh
and
cool
right
merrily
we
sang
and
i
doubt
not
we
should
have
sung
the
whole
night
through
had
not
my
sister
miss
susan
come
tapping
at
my
door
saying
that
i
had
waked
her
parrot
and
would
do
well
to
cease
my
uproar
and
go
to
sleep
judge
methuen
has
a
copy
of
bishop
percy
reliques
of
ancient
english
poetry
that
he
prizes
highly
it
is
the
first
edition
of
this
noble
work
and
was
originally
presented
by
percy
to
birch
of
the
british
museum
the
judge
found
these
three
volumes
exposed
for
sale
in
a
london
book
stall
and
he
comprehended
them
without
delay
a
great
bargain
you
will
admit
when
i
tell
you
that
they
cost
the
judge
but
three
shillings
how
came
these
precious
volumes
into
that
book
stall
i
shall
not
presume
to
say
strange
indeed
are
the
vicissitudes
which
befall
books
stranger
even
than
the
happenings
in
human
life
all
men
are
not
as
considerate
of
books
as
i
am
i
wish
they
were
many
times
i
have
felt
the
deepest
compassion
for
noble
volumes
in
the
possession
of
persons
wholly
incapable
of
appreciating
them
the
helpless
books
seemed
to
appeal
to
me
to
rescue
them
and
too
many
times
i
have
been
tempted
to
snatch
them
from
their
inhospitable
shelves
and
march
them
away
to
a
pleasant
refuge
beneath
my
own
comfortable
roof
tree
too
few
people
seem
to
realize
that
books
have
feelings
but
if
i
know
one
thing
better
than
another
i
know
this
that
my
books
know
me
and
love
me
when
of
a
morning
i
awaken
i
cast
my
eyes
about
my
room
to
see
how
fare
my
beloved
treasures
and
as
i
cry
cheerily
to
them
to
you
sweet
friends
how
lovingly
they
beam
upon
me
and
how
glad
they
are
that
my
repose
has
been
unbroken
when
i
take
them
from
their
places
how
tenderly
do
they
respond
to
the
caresses
of
my
hands
and
with
what
exultation
do
they
respond
unto
my
call
for
sympathy
laughter
for
my
gayer
moods
distraction
for
my
cares
solace
for
my
griefs
gossip
for
my
idler
moments
tears
for
my
sorrows
counsel
for
my
doubts
and
assurance
against
my
fears
these
things
my
books
give
me
with
a
promptness
and
a
certainty
and
a
cheerfulness
which
are
more
than
human
so
that
i
were
less
than
human
did
i
not
love
these
comforters
and
bear
eternal
gratitude
to
them
judge
methuen
read
me
once
a
little
poem
which
i
fancy
mightily
it
is
entitled
winfreda
and
you
will
find
it
in
your
percy
if
you
have
one
the
last
stanza
as
i
recall
it
runs
in
this
wise
and
when
by
envy
time
transported
shall
seek
to
rob
us
of
our
joys
you
in
our
girls
again
be
courted
and
i
go
wooing
in
our
boys
now
who
was
the
author
of
those
lines
asked
the
judge
undoubtedly
oliver
wendell
holmes
said
i
they
have
the
flavor
peculiar
to
our
autocrat
none
but
he
could
have
done
up
so
much
sweetness
in
such
a
quaint
little
bundle
you
are
wrong
said
the
judge
but
the
mistake
is
a
natural
one
the
whole
poem
is
such
a
one
as
holmes
might
have
written
but
it
saw
the
light
long
before
our
dear
doctor
day
what
a
pity
that
its
authorship
is
not
known
yet
why
a
pity
quoth
i
is
it
not
true
that
words
are
the
only
things
that
live
forever
are
we
not
mortal
and
are
not
books
immortal
homer
harp
is
broken
and
horace
lyre
is
unstrung
and
the
voices
of
the
great
singers
are
hushed
but
their
songs
their
songs
are
imperishable
o
friend
what
moots
it
to
them
or
to
us
who
gave
this
epic
or
that
lyric
to
immortality
the
singer
belongs
to
a
year
his
song
to
all
time
i
know
it
is
the
custom
now
to
credit
the
author
with
his
work
for
this
is
a
utilitarian
age
and
all
things
are
by
the
pound
or
the
piece
and
for
so
much
money
so
when
a
song
is
printed
it
is
printed
in
small
type
and
the
name
of
him
who
wrote
it
is
appended
thereunto
in
big
type
if
the
song
be
meritorious
it
goes
to
the
corners
of
the
earth
through
the
medium
of
the
art
preservative
of
arts
but
the
longer
and
the
farther
it
travels
the
bigger
does
the
type
of
the
song
become
and
the
smaller
becomes
the
type
wherein
the
author
name
is
set
then
finally
some
inconsiderate
hand
wielding
the
pen
or
shears
blots
out
or
snips
off
the
poet
name
and
henceforth
the
song
is
anonymous
a
great
iconoclast
a
royal
old
iconoclast
is
time
but
he
hath
no
terrors
for
those
precious
things
which
are
embalmed
in
words
and
the
only
fellow
that
shall
surely
escape
him
till
the
crack
of
doom
is
he
whom
men
know
by
the
name
of
anonymous
doubtless
you
speak
truly
said
the
judge
yet
it
would
be
different
if
i
but
had
the
ordering
of
things
i
would
let
the
poets
live
forever
and
i
would
kill
off
most
of
their
poetry
i
do
not
wonder
that
ritson
and
percy
quarrelled
it
was
his
misfortune
that
ritson
quarrelled
with
everybody
yet
ritson
was
a
scrupulously
honest
man
he
was
so
vulgarly
sturdy
in
his
honesty
that
he
would
make
all
folk
tell
the
truth
even
though
the
truth
were
of
such
a
character
as
to
bring
the
blush
of
shame
to
the
devil
hardened
cheek
on
the
other
hand
percy
believed
that
there
were
certain
true
things
which
should
not
be
opened
out
in
the
broad
light
of
day
it
was
this
conviction
which
kept
him
from
publishing
the
manuscript
folio
a
priceless
treasure
which
ritson
never
saw
and
which
had
it
fallen
in
ritson
way
instead
of
percy
would
have
been
clapped
at
once
into
the
hands
of
the
printer
how
fortunate
it
is
for
us
that
we
have
in
our
time
so
great
a
scholar
as
francis
james
child
so
enamored
of
balladry
and
so
learned
in
it
to
complete
and
finish
the
work
of
his
predecessors
i
count
myself
happy
that
i
have
heard
from
the
lips
of
this
enthusiast
several
of
the
rarest
and
noblest
of
the
old
british
and
old
scottish
ballads
and
i
recall
with
pride
that
he
complimented
me
upon
my
spirited
vocal
rendering
of
burd
isabel
and
sir
patrick
lang
johnny
more
the
duke
o
gordon
daughter
and
two
or
three
other
famous
songs
which
i
had
learned
while
sojourning
among
the
humbler
classes
in
the
north
of
england
after
paying
our
compliments
to

there
you

nothing

fears
what

about

will
create
the
impression
that
i
am
unkindly
disposed
toward
the
bookselling
craft
for
the
last
fifty
years
i
have
had
uninterrupted
dealings
with
booksellers
and
none
knows
better
than
the

themselves
that
i
particularly
admire
them
as
a

and

i
have
too
a
large
collection
of
portraits
of
modern
booksellers
including
a
sketch
of
quaritch
a
line
engraving
of
rimell
and
a
very
excellent
etching
of
my
dear
friend
the
late
henry
stevens
one
of
the
portraits
is
a
unique
for
i
had
it
painted
myself
and
i
have
never
permitted
any
copy
to
be
made
of
it
it
is
of
my
bookseller
and
it
represents
him
in
the
garb
of
a
fisherman
holding
his
rod
and
reel
in
one
hand
and
the
copy
of
the
compleat
angler
in
the
other
curwen
speaks
of
booksellers
as
being
singularly
thrifty
able
industrious
and
persevering
in
some
few
cases
singularly
venturesome
liberal
and
my
own
observation
and
experience
have
taught
me
that
as
a
class
booksellers
are
exceptionally
intelligent
ranking
with
printers
in
respect
to
the
variety
and
extent
of
their
learning
they
have
however
this
distinct
advantage
over
the
printers
they
are
not
brought
in
contact
with
the
manifold
temptations
to
intemperance
and
profligacy
which
environ
the
votaries
of
the
art
preservative
of
arts
horace
smith
has
said
that
were
there
no
readers
there
certainly
would
be
no
writers
clearly
therefore
the
existence
of
writers
depends
upon
the
existence
of
readers
and
of
course
since
the
cause
must
be
antecedent
to
the
effect
readers
existed
before
writers
yet
on
the
other
hand
if
there
were
no
writers
there
could
be
no
readers
so
it
would
appear
that
writers
must
be
antecedent
to
readers
it
amazes
me
that
a
reasoner
so
shrewd
so
clear
and
so
exacting
as
horace
smith
did
not
pursue
the
proposition
further
for
without
booksellers
there
would
have
been
no
market
for
books
the
author
would
not
have
been
able
to
sell
and
the
reader
would
not
have
been
able
to
buy
the
further
we
proceed
with
the
investigation
the
more
satisfied
we
become
that
the
original
man
was
three
of
number
one
of
him
being
the
bookseller
who
established
friendly
relations
between
the
other
two
of
him
saying
i
will
serve
you
both
by
inciting
both
a
demand
and
a
supply
so
then
the
author
did
his
part
and
the
reader
his
which
i
take
to
be
a
much
more
dignified
scheme
than
that
suggested
by
darwin
and
his
school
of
investigators
by
the
very
nature
of
their
occupation
booksellers
are
their
association
with
every
class
of
humanity
and
their
constant
companionship
with
books
give
them
a
liberality
that
enables
them
to
view
with
singular
clearness
and
dispassionateness
every
phase
of
life
and
every
dispensation
of
providence
they
are
not
always
practical
for
the
development
of
the
spiritual
and
intellectual
natures
in
man
does
not
at
the
same
time
promote
dexterity
in
the
use
of
the
baser
organs
of
the
body
i
have
known
philosophers
who
could
not
harness
a
horse
or
even
shoo
chickens
ralph
waldo
emerson
once
consumed
several
hours
time
trying
to
determine
whether
he
should
trundle
a
wheelbarrow
by
pushing
it
or
by
pulling
it
bronson
alcott
once
tried
to
construct
a
chicken
coop
and
he
had
boarded
himself
up
inside
the
structure
before
he
discovered
that
he
had
not
provided
for
a
door
or
for
windows
we
have
all
heard
the
story
of
isaac
newton
how
he
cut
two
holes
in
his
a
large
one
for
his
cat
to
enter
by
and
a
small
one
for
the
kitten
this
unworldliness
this
impossibility
if
you
please
is
characteristic
of
intellectual
progression
judge
methuen
second
son
is
named
grolier
and
the
fact
that
he
does
know
enough
to
come
in
out
of
the
rain
has
inspired
both
the
judge
and
myself
with
the
conviction
that
in
due
time
grolier
will
become
a
great
philosopher
the
mention
of
this
revered
name
reminds
me
that
my
bookseller
told
me
the
other
day
that
just
before
i
entered
his
shop
a
wealthy
patron
of
the
arts
and
muses
called
with
a
volume
which
he
wished
to
have
rebound
i
can
send
it
to
paris
or
to
london
said
my
bookseller
if
you
have
no
choice
of
binder
i
will
entrust
it
to
zaehnsdorf
with
instructions
to
lavish
his
choicest
art
upon
it
but
indeed
i
have
a
choice
cried
the
plutocrat
proudly
i
noticed
a
large
number
of
grolier
bindings
at
the
art
institute
last
week
and
i
want
something
of
the
same
kind
myself
send
the
book
to
grolier
and
tell
him
to
do
his
prettiest
by
it
for
i
can
stand
the
expense
no
matter
what
it
is
somewhere
in
his
admirable
discourse
old
walton
has
stated
the
theory
that
an
angler
must
be
born
and
then
made
i
have
always
held
the
same
to
be
true
of
the
bookseller
there
are
many
too
many
charlatans
in
the
trade
the
bookseller
enters
upon
and
conducts
bookselling
not
merely
as
a
trade
and
for
the
purpose
of
amassing
riches
but
because
he
loves
books
and
because
he
has
pleasure
in
diffusing
their
gracious
influences
judge
methuen
tells
me
that
it
is
no
longer
the
fashion
to
refer
to
persons
or
things
as
being
the
fashion
as
he
says
passed
out
some
years
ago
when
a
writer
in
a
german
paper
was
led
into
an
amusing
blunder
by
an
english
review
the
reviewer
having
occasion
to
draw
a
distinction
between
george
and
robert
cruikshank
spoke
of
the
former
as
the
real
simon
pure
the
german
not
understanding
the
allusion
gravely
told
his
readers
that
george
cruikshank
was
a
pseudonym
the
author
real
name
being
simon
pure
this
incident
is
given
in
henry
wheatley
literary
blunders
a
very
charming
book
but
one
that
could
have
been
made
more
interesting
to
me
had
it
recorded
the
curious
blunder
which
frederick
saunders
makes
in
his
story
of
some
famous
books
on
page
we
find
this
information
among
earlier
american
bards
we
instance
dana
whose
imaginative
poem
culprit
fay
so
replete
with
poetic
beauty
is
a
fairy
tale
of
the
highlands
of
the
hudson
the
origin
of
the
poem
is
traced
to
a
conversation
with
cooper
the
novelist
and
halleck
the
poet
who
speaking
of
the
scottish
streams
and
their
legendary
associations
insisted
that
the
american
rivers
were
not
susceptible
of
like
poetic
treatment
dana
thought
otherwise
and
to
make
his
position
good
produced
three
days
after
this
poem
it
may
be
that
saunders
wrote
the
name
drake
for
it
was
james
rodman
drake
who
did
the
culprit
fay
perhaps
it
was
the
printer
fault
that
the
poem
is
accredited
to
dana
perhaps
saunders
writes
so
legible
a
hand
that
the
printers
are
careless
with
his
manuscript
there
is
says
wheatley
there
is
a
popular
notion
among
authors
that
it
is
not
wise
to
write
a
clear
hand
menage
was
one
of
the
first
to
express
it
he
wrote
you
desire
that
no
mistake
shall
appear
in
the
works
which
you
publish
never
send
copy
to
the
printer
for
in
that
case
the
manuscript
is
given
to
young
apprentices
who
make
a
thousand
errors
while
on
the
other
hand
that
which
is
difficult
to
read
is
dealt
with
by
the
the
most
distressing
blunder
i
ever
read
in
print
was
made
at
the
time
of
the
burial
of
the
famous
antiquary
and
litterateur
john
payne
collier
in
the
london
newspapers
of
it
was
reported
that
the
remains
of
the
late
john
payne
collier
were
interred
yesterday
in
bray
churchyard
near
maidenhead
in
the
presence
of
a
large
number
of
spectators
thereupon
the
eastern
daily
press
published
the
following
remarkable
perversion
the
bray
colliery
disaster
the
remains
of
the
late
john
payne
collier
were
interred
yesterday
afternoon
in
the
bray
churchyard
in
the
presence
of
a
large
number
of
friends
and
spectators
far
be
it
from
the
and
the
to
rail
at
blunders
for
not
unfrequently
these
very
blunders
make
books
valuable
who
cares
for
a
pine
horace
that
does
not
contain
the
potest
error
the
genuine
first
edition
of
hawthorne
scarlet
letter
is
to
be
determined
by
the
presence
of
a
certain
typographical
slip
in
the
introduction
the
first
edition
of
the
english
scriptures
printed
in
ireland
is
much
desired
by
collectors
and
simply
because
of
an
error
isaiah
bids
us
sin
no
more
but
the
belfast
printer
by
some
means
or
another
transposed
the
letters
in
such
wise
as
to
make
the
injunction
read
sin
on
more
the
wicked
bible
is
a
book
that
is
seldom
met
with
and
therefore
in
great
demand
it
was
printed
in
the
time
of
charles
and
it
is
notorious
because
it
omits
the
adverb
not
in
its
version
of
the
seventh
commandment
the
printers
were
fined
a
large
sum
for
this
gross
error
six
copies
of
the
wicked
bible
are
known
to
be
in
existence
at
one
time
the
late
james
lenox
had
two
copies
in
his
interesting
memoirs
henry
stevens
tells
how
he
picked
up
one
copy
in
paris
for
fifty
guineas
rabelais
printer
got
the
satirical
doctor
into
deep
water
for
printing
asne
for
ame
the
council
of
the
sorbonne
took
the
matter
up
and
asked
francis
to
prosecute
rabelais
for
heresy
this
the
king
declined
to
do
and
rabelais
proceeded
forthwith
to
torment
the
council
for
having
founded
a
charge
of
heresy
upon
a
printer
blunder
once
upon
a
time
the
foulis
printing
establishment
at
glasgow
determined
to
print
a
perfect
horace
accordingly
the
proof
sheets
were
hung
up
at
the
gates
of
the
university
and
a
sum
of
money
was
paid
for
every
error
detected
notwithstanding
these
precautions
the
edition
had
six
uncorrected
errors
in
it
when
it
was
finally
published
disraeli
says
that
the
pearl
bible
had
six
thousand
errata
the
works
of
picus
of
mirandula
strasburg
gave
a
list
of
errata
covering
fifteen
folio
pages
and
a
worse
case
is
that
of
missae
ac
missalis
anatomia
a
volume
of
one
hundred
and
pages
fifteen
of
which
are
devoted
to
the
errata
the
author
of
the
missae
felt
so
deeply
aggrieved
by
this
array
of
blunders
that
he
made
a
public
explanation
to
the
effect
that
the
devil
himself
stole
the
manuscript
tampered
with
it
and
then
actually
compelled
the
printer
to
misread
it
i
am
not
sure
that
this
ingenious
explanation
did
not
give
origin
to
the
term
of
printer
devil
it
is
frightful
to
think
what
nonsense
sometimes
they
make
of
one
sense
and
what
worse
of
one
rhymes
it
was
only
last
week
in
my
ode
upon
spring
which
i
meant
to
have
made
a
most
beautiful
thing
when
i
talked
of
the
dewdrops
from
freshly
blown
roses
the
nasty
things
made
it
from
freshly
blown
noses
we
can
fancy
richard
porson
rage
for
porson
was
of
violent
temper
when
having
written
the
statement
that
the
crowd
rent
the
air
with
their
shouts
his
printer
made
the
line
read
the
crowd
rent
the
air
with
their
snouts
however
this
error
was
a
natural
one
since
it
occurs
in
the
catechism
of
the
swinish
multitude
royalty
only
are
privileged
when
it
comes
to
the
matter
of
blundering
when
louis
xiv
was
a
boy
he
one
day
spoke
of
un
carosse
he
should
have
said
une
carosse
but
he
was
king
and
having
changed
the
gender
of
carosse
the
change
was
accepted
and
unto
this
day
carosse
is
masculine
that
errors
should
occur
in
newspapers
is
not
remarkable
for
much
of
the
work
in
a
newspaper
office
is
done
hastily
yet
some
of
these
errors
are
very
amusing
i
remember
to
have
read
in
a
berlin
newspaper
a
number
of
years
ago
that
prince
bismarck
is
trying
to
keep
up
honest
and
straightforward
relations
with
all
the
girls
madchen
this
statement
seemed
incomprehensible
until
it
transpired
that
the
word
madchen
was
in
this
instance
a
misprint
for
machten
a
word
meaning
all
the
european
powers
x
when
fanchonette
bewitched
me
the
garden
in
which
i
am
straying
has
so
many
diversions
to
catch
my
eye
to
engage
my
attention
and
to
inspire
reminiscence
that
i
find
it
hard
to
treat
of
its
beauties
methodically
i
find
myself
wandering
up
and
down
hither
and
thither
in
so
irresponsible
a
fashion
that
i
marvel
you
have
not
abandoned
me
as
the
most
irrational
of
madmen
yet
how
could
it
be
otherwise
all
around
me
i
see
those
things
that
draw
me
from
the
pathway
i
set
out
to
pursue
like
a
heedless
butterfly
i
flit
from
this
sweet
unto
that
glorying
and
revelling
in
the
sunshine
and
the
posies
there
is
little
that
is
selfish
in
a
love
like
this
and
herein
we
have
another
reason
why
the
passion
for
books
is
beneficial
he
who
loves
women
must
and
should
love
some
one
woman
above
the
rest
and
he
has
her
to
his
keeping
which
i
esteem
to
be
one
kind
of
selfishness
but
he
who
truly
loves
books
loves
all
books
alike
and
not
only
this
but
it
grieves
him
that
all
other
men
do
not
share
with
him
this
noble
passion
verily
this
is
the
most
unselfish
of
loves
to
return
now
to
the
matter
of
booksellers
i
would
fain
impress
you
with
the
excellences
of
the
craft
for
i
know
their
virtues
my
association
with
them
has
covered
so
long
a
period
and
has
been
so
intimate
that
even
in
a
vast
multitude
of
people
i
have
no
difficulty
in
determining
who
are
the
booksellers
and
who
are
not
for
having
to
do
with
books
these
men
in
due
time
come
to
resemble
their
wares
not
only
in
appearance
but
also
in
conversation
my
bookseller
has
dwelt
so
long
in
his
corner
with
folios
and
quartos
and
other
antique
tomes
that
he
talks
in
and
has
the
modest
engaging
look
of
a
brown
old
stout
binding
and
to
the
delectation
of
discriminating
olfactories
he
exhaleth
an
odor
of
mildew
and
of
tobacco
commingled
which
is
more
grateful
to
the
true
bibliophile
than
all
the
perfumes
of
araby
i
have
studied
the
craft
so
diligently
that
by
merely
clapping
my
eyes
upon
a
bookseller
i
can
tell
you
with
certainty
what
manner
of
books
he
sells
but
you
must
know
that
the
ideal
bookseller
has
no
fads
being
equally
proficient
in
and
a
lover
of
all
spheres
departments
branches
and
lines
of
his
art
he
is
moreover
of
a
benignant
nature
and
he
denies
credit
to
none
yet
withal
he
is
righteously
so
discriminating
that
he
lets
the
poor
scholar
have
for
a
paltry
sum
that
which
the
rich
parvenu
must
pay
dearly
for
he
is
courteous
and

courtesy
and
consideration
are
most
seemly
samuel
johnson
once
rolled
into
a
london
bookseller
shop
to
ask
for
literary
employment
the
bookseller
scrutinized
his
burly
frame
enormous
hands
coarse
face
and
humble
apparel
you
would
make
a
better
porter
said
he
this
was
too
much
for
the
young
lexicographer
patience
he
picked
up
a
folio
and
incontinently
let
fly
at
the
bookseller
head
and
then
stepping
over
the
prostrate
victim
he
made
his
exit
saying
lie
there
thou
lump
of
lead
this
bookseller
was
osborne
who
had
a
shop
at
gray
inn
gate
to
boswell
johnson
subsequently
explained
sir
he
was
impertinent
to
me
and
i
beat
him
jacob
tonson
was
dryden
bookseller
in
the
earlier
times
a
seller
was
also
a
publisher
of
books
dryden
was
not
always
on
amiable
terms
with
tonson
presumably
because
dryden
invariably
was
in
debt
to
tonson
on
one
occasion
dryden
asked
for
an
advance
of
money
but
tonson
refused
upon
the
grounds
that
the
poet
overdraft
already
exceeded
the
limits
of
reasonableness
thereupon
dryden
penned
the
following
lines
and
sent
them
to
tonson
with
the
message
that
he
who
wrote
these
lines
could
write
more
with
leering
looks
and
freckled
fair
with
two
left
legs
with
hair
and
frowzy
pores
that
taint
the
ambient
air
these
lines
wrought
the
desired
effect
tonson
sent
the
money
which
dryden
had
asked
for
when
dryden
died
tonson
made
overtures
to
pope
but
the
latter
soon
went
over
to
tonson
most
formidable
rival
bernard
lintot
on
one
occasion
pope
happened
to
be
writing
to
both
publishers
and
by
a
curious
blunder
he
inclosed
to
each
the
letter
intended
for
the
other
in
the
letter
meant
for
tonson
he
said
that
lintot
was
a
scoundrel
and
in
the
letter
meant
for
lintot
he
declared
that
tonson
was
an
old
rascal
we
can
fancy
how
little
satisfaction
lintot
and
tonson
derived
from
the
perusal
of
these
missent
epistles
andrew
millar
was
the
publisher
who
had
practical
charge
of
the
production
of
johnson
dictionary
it
seems
that
johnson
drew
out
his
stipulated
honorarium
of
eight
thousand
dollars
to
be
more
exact
before
the
dictionary
went
to
press
this
is
not
surprising
for
the
work
of
preparation
consumed
eight
years
instead
of
three
as
johnson
had
calculated
johnson
inquired
of
the
messenger
what
millar
said
when
he
received
the
last
batch
of
copy
the
messenger
answered
he
said
god
i
have
done
with
him
this
made
johnson
smile
i
am
glad
said
he
quietly
that
he
thanks
god
for
anything
i
was
not
done
with
my
discourse
when
a
book
was
brought
in
from
judge
methuen
the
interruption
was
a
pleasant
one
i
was
too
busy
last
evening
writes
the
judge
to
bring
you
this
volume
which
i
picked
up
in
a
la
salle
street
stall
yesterday
i
know
your
love
for
the
scallawag
villon
so
i
am
sure
you
will
fancy
the
lines
which
evidently
the
former
owner
of
this
book
has
scribbled
upon
the
fancy
them
indeed
i
do
and
if
you
dote
on
the
scallawag
as
i
dote
on
him
you
also
will
declare
that
our
anonymous
poet
has
not
wrought
francois
villon
if
i
were
francois
villon
and
francois
villon
i
what
would
it
matter
to
me
how
the
time
might
drag
or
fly
he
would
in
sweaty
anguish
toil
the
days
and
nights
away
and
still
not
keep
the
prowling
growling
howling
wolf
at
bay
but
with
my
valiant
bottle
and
my
frouzy
and
my
score
of
loyal
standing
guard
for
me
outside
what
worry
of
the
morrow
would
provoke
a
casual
sigh
if
i
were
francois
villon
and
francois
villon
i
if
i
were
francois
villon
and
francois
villon
i
to
yonder
gloomy
boulevard
at
midnight
i
would
hie
stop
stranger
and
deliver
your
possessions
ere
you
feel
the
mettle
of
my
bludgeon
or
the
temper
of
my
steel
he
should
give
me
gold
and
diamonds
his
and
his
cane
now
back
my
boon
companions
to
our
bordel
with
our
gain
and
back
within
that
brothel
how
the
bottles
they
would
fly
if
i
were
francois
villon
and
francois
villon
i
if
i
were
francois
villon
and
francois
villon
i
we
both
would
mock
the
gibbet
which
the
law
has
lifted
high
he
in
his
meagre
shabby
home
in
my
roaring
den
he
with
his
babes
around
him
with
my
hunted
men
his
virtue
be
his
bulwark
my
genius
should
be
mine
go
fetch
my
pen
sweet
margot
and
a
jorum
of
your
wine
so
would
one
vainly
plod
and
one
win
immortality
if
i
were
francois
villon
and
francois
villon
i
my
acquaintance
with
master
villon
was
made
in
paris
during
my
second
visit
to
that
fascinating
capital
and
for
a
while
i
was
under
his
spell
to
that
extent
that
i
would
read
no
book
but
his
and
i
made
journeys
to
rouen
tours
bordeaux
and
poitiers
for
the
purpose
of
familiarizing
myself
with
the
spots
where
he
had
lived
and
always
under
the
surveillance
of
the
police
in
fact
i
became
so
infatuated
of
villonism
that
at
one
time
i
seriously
thought
of
abandoning
myself
to
a
life
of
crime
in
order
to
emulate
in
certain
particulars
at
least
the
example
of
my
hero
there
were
however
hindrances
to
this
scheme
first
of
which
was
my
inability
to
find
associates
whom
i
wished
to
attach
to
my
cause
in
the
capacity
in
which
colin
de
cayeulx
and
the
baron
de
grigny
served
master
francois
i
sought
the
companionship
of
several
fellows
whom
i
believed
suited
to
my
purposes
but
almost
immediately
i
wearied
of
them
for
they
had
never
looked
into
a
book
and
were
so
profoundly
ignorant
as
to
be
unable
to
distinguish
between
a
folio
and
a
then
again
it
befell
that
while
the
villon
fever
was
raging
within
and
i
was
contemplating
a
career
of
vice
i
had
a
letter
from
my
uncle
cephas
apprising
me
that
captivity
waite
she
was
now
eliphalet
parker
had
named
her
after
me
this
intelligence
had
the
effect
of
cooling
and
sobering
me
i
began
to
realize
that
with
the
responsibility
the
coming
and
the
christening
of
captivity
had
imposed
upon
me
it
behooved
me
to
guard
with
exceeding
jealousy
the
honor
of
the
name
which
my
namesake
bore
while
i
was
thus
fanchonette
came
across
my
pathway
and
with
the
appearance
of
fanchonette
every
ambition
to
figure
in
the
annals
of
bravado
left
me
fanchonette
was
the
niece
of
my
landlady
her
father
was
a
perfumer
she
lived
with
the
old
people
in
the
rue
des
capucins
she
was
of
middling
stature
and
had
blue
eyes
and
black
hair
had
she
not
been
french
she
would
have
been
irish
or
perhaps
a
grecian
her
manner
had
an
indefinable
charm
it
was
she
who
acquainted
me
with
beranger
that
is
why
i
never
take
up
that
precious
volume
that
i
do
not
think
sweetly
and
tenderly
of
fanchonette
the
book
is
bound
as
you
see
in
a
dainty
blue
and
the
border
toolings
are
delicate
tracings
of
white
all
for
a
purpose
i
can
assure
you
she
used
to
wear
a
dainty
blue
gown
from
behind
the
nether
hem
of
which
the
most
immaculate
of
petticoats
peeped
out
if
we
were
never
boys
how
barren
and
lonely
our
age
would
be
next
to
the
ineffably
blessed
period
of
youth
there
is
no
time
of
life
pleasanter
than
that
in
which
serene
old
age
reviews
the
exploits
and
the
prodigies
of
boyhood
ah
my
gay
fellows
harvest
your
crops

that
your
barns

full

your

recall
the
old
time
to
see
her
rise
out
of
the
dear
past
to
hear
fanchonette
voice
again
to
feel
the
grace
of
springtime
how
gloriously
sweet
this
is
the
little
quarrels
the
reconciliations
the
coquetries
the
jealousies
the
reproaches
the

all
the

diagnosis
of
the
bacillus
librorum
for
a
good
many
years
i
was
deeply
interested
in
british
politics
i
was
converted
to
liberalism
by
an
incident
which
i
deem
well
worth
relating
one
afternoon
i
entered
a
in
high
holborn
and
found
that
the
hon
william
gladstone
had
preceded
me
thither
i
had
never
seen
gladstone
before
i
recognized
him
now
by
his
resemblance
to
the
caricatures
and
by
his
unlikeness
to
the
portraits
which
the
newspapers
had
printed
as
i
entered
the
shop
i
heard
the
bookseller
ask
what
books
shall
i
send
to
this
with
a
very
magnificent
sweep
of
his
arms
indicating
every
point
of
the
compass
gladstone
made
answer
send
me
those
with
these
words
he
left
the
place
and
i
stepped
forward
to
claim
a
volume
which
had
attracted
my
favorable
attention
several
days
previous
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
the
bookseller
politely
but
that
book
is
sold
sold
i
cried
yes
sir
replied
the
bookseller
smiling
with
evident
pride
gladstone
just
bought
it
i
have
a
book
for
sale
gladstone
just
bought
them
all
the
bookseller
then
proceeded
to
tell
me
that
whenever
gladstone
entered
a
bookshop
he
made
a
practice
of
buying
everything
in
sight
that
magnificent
sweeping
gesture
of
his
comprehended
everything
theology
history
social
science
medicine
travel
biography
everything
that
came
to
his
net
was
fish
this
is
the
third
time
gladstone
has
visited
me
said
the
bookseller
and
this
is
the
third
time
he
has
cleaned
me
out
this
man
is
a
good
man
says
i
to
myself
so
notable
a
lover
of
books
surely
can
not
err
the
cause
of
home
rule
must
be
a
just
one
after
all
from
others
intimately
acquainted
with
him
i
learned
that
gladstone
was
an
omnivorous
reader
that
he
ordered
his
books
by
the
and
that
his
home
in
hawarden
literally
overflowed
with
books
he
made
a
practice
i
was
told
of
overhauling
his
library
once
in
so
often
and
of
weeding
out
such
volumes
as
he
did
not
care
to
keep
these
discarded
books
were
sent
to
the
dealers
and
it
is
said
that
the
dealers
not
unfrequently
took
advantage
of
gladstone
by
reselling
him
over
and
over
again
and
at
advanced
prices
too
the
very
lots
of
books
he
had
culled
out
and
rejected
every
has
his
own
way
of
buying
so
there
are
as
many
ways
of
buying
as
there
are
purchasers
however
judge
methuen
and
i
have
agreed
that
all
buyers
may
be
classed
in
these
following
specified
grand
divisions
the
reckless
buyer
the
shrewd
buyer
the
timid
buyer
of
these
three
classes
the
third
is
least
worthy
of
our
consideration
although
it
includes
very
many
lovers
of
books
and
consequently
very
many
friends
of
mine
i
have
actually
known
men
to
hesitate
to
ponder
to
dodder
for
weeks
nay
months
over
the
purchase
of
a
book
not
because
they
did
not
want
it
nor
because
they
deemed
the
price
exorbitant
nor
yet
because
they
were
not
abundantly
able
to
pay
that
price
their
hesitancy
was
due
to
an
innate
congenital
lack
of
determination
that
same
hideous
curse
of
vacillation
which
is
responsible
for
so
much
misery
in
human
life
i
have
made
a
study
of
these
people
and
i
find
that
most
of
them
are
bachelors
whose
state
of
singleness
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
same
hesitancy
which
has
deprived
them
of
many
a
coveted
volume
has
operated
to
their
discomfiture
in
the
matrimonial
sphere
while
they
deliberated
another
bolder
than
they
came
along
and
walked
off
with
the
prize
one
of
the
gamest
buyers
i
know
of
was
the
late
john
a
rice
of
chicago
as
a
competitor
at
the
great
auction
sales
he
was
invincible
and
why
because
having
determined
to
buy
a
book
he
put
no
limit
to
the
amount
of
his
bid
his
instructions
to
his
agent
were
in
these
words
i
must
have
those
books
no
matter
what
they
cost
an
english
collector
found
in
rice
library
a
set
of
rare
volumes
he
had
been
searching
for
for
years
how
did
you
happen
to
get
them
he
asked
you
bought
them
at
the
spencer
sale
and
against
my
bid
do
you
know
i
told
my
buyer
to
bid
a
thousand
pounds
for
them
if
necessary
that
was
where
i
had
the
advantage
of
you
said
rice
quietly
i
specified
no
limit
i
simply
told
my
man
to
buy
the
books
the
spirit
of
the
collector
cropped
out
early
in
rice
i
remember
to
have
heard
him
tell
how
one
time
when
he
was
a
young
man
he
was
shuffling
over
a
lot
of
tracts
in
a
bin
in
front
of
a
boston
bookstall
his
eye
suddenly
fell
upon
a
little
pamphlet
entitled
the
he
picked
it
up
and
read
it
it
was
a
poem
founded
upon
the
defeat
of
generals
wayne
irving
and
proctor
the
last
stanza
ran
in
this
wise
and
now
i
closed
my
epic
strain
i
tremble
as
i
show
it
lest
this
same
wayne
should
ever
catch
the
poet
rice
noticed
that
the
pamphlet
bore
the
imprint
of
james
rivington
new
york
it
occurred
to
him
that
some
time
this
modest
tract
of
eighteen
pages
might
be
valuable
at
any
rate
he
paid
the
fifteen
cents
demanded
for
it
and
at
the
same
time
he
purchased
for
ten
cents
another
pamphlet
entitled
the
american
tories
a
satire
twenty
years
later
having
learned
the
value
of
these
exceedingly
rare
tracts
rice
sent
them
to
london
and
had
them
bound
in
francis
bedford
best
style
crimson
crushed
levant
morocco
finished
to
a
grolier
pattern
bedford
charges
amounted
to
dollars
which
with
the
original
cost
of
the
pamphlets
represented
an
expenditure
of
dollars
and
cents
upon
rice
part
at
the
sale
of
the
rice
library
in
however
this
curious
rare
and
beautiful
little
book
brought
the
extraordinary
sum
of
seven
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
the
rice
library
contained
about
five
thousand
volumes
and
it
realized
at
auction
sale
somewhat
more
than
thousand
dollars
rice
has
often
told
me
that
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
part
with
his
books
yet
his
health
was
so
poor
that
he
found
it
imperative
to
retire
from
business
and
to
devote
a
long
period
of
time
to
travel
these
were
the
considerations
that
induced
him
finally
to
part
with
his
treasures
i
have
never
regretted
having
sold
them
he
said
two
years
after
the
sale
the
chicago
fire
came
along
had
i
retained
those
books
every
one
of
them
would
have
been
lost
rice
shared
her
husband
enthusiasm
for
books
whenever
a
new
invoice
arrived
the
two
would
lock
themselves
in
their
room
get
down
upon
their
knees
on
the
floor
open
the
box
take
out
the
treasures
and
gloat
over
them
together
noble
lady
she
was
such
a
wife
as
any
good
man
might
be
proud
of
they
were
very
happy
in
their
companionship
on
earth
were
my
dear
old
friends
he
was
the
first
to
go
their
separation
was
short
together
once
more
and
forever
they
share
the
illimitable
joys
which
await
all
lovers
of
good
books
when
virtue
hath
mournfully
writ
the
colophon
to
their
human
careers
although
rice
survived
the
sale
of
his
remarkable
library
a
period
of
years
he
did
not
get
together
again
a
collection
of
books
that
he
was
willing
to
call
a
library
his
first
collection
was
so
remarkable
that
he
preferred
to
have
his
fame
rest
wholly
upon
it
perhaps
he
was
wise
yet
how
few
collectors
there
are
who
would
have
done
as
he
did
as
for
myself
i
verily
believe
that
if
by
fire
or
by
water
my
library
should
be
destroyed
this
night
i
should
start
in
again
upon
the
collection
of
another
library
or
if
i
did
not
do
this
i
should
lay
myself
down
to
die
for
how
could
i
live
without
the
companionships
to
which
i
have
ever
been
accustomed
and
which
have
grown
as
dear
to
me
as
life
itself
whenever
judge
methuen
is
in
a
jocular
mood
and
wishes
to
tease
me
he
asks
me
whether
i
have
forgotten
the
time
when
i
was
possessed
of
a
spirit
of
reform
and
registered
a
solemn
vow
in
high
heaven
to
buy
no
more
books
teasing
says
victor
hugo
is
the
malice
of
good
men
judge
methuen
means
no
evil
when
he
recalls
that
weakness
the
one
weakness
in
all
my
career
no
i
have
not
forgotten
that
time
i
look
back
upon
it
with
a
shudder
of
horror
for
wretched
indeed
would
have
been
my
existence
had
i
carried
into
effect
the
project
i
devised
at
that
remote
period
has
an
interesting
theory
which
you
will
find
recorded
in
the
published
proceedings
of
the
national
academy
of
sciences
vol
or
if
you
can
not
procure
copies
of
that
work
it
may
serve
your
purpose
to
know
that
the
doctor
theory
is
to
this
effect
that
bibliomania
does
not
deserve
the
name
of
bibliomania
until
it
is
exhibited
in
the
second
stage
for
secondary
bibliomania
there
is
no
known
cure
the
few
cases
reported
as
having
been
cured
were
doubtless
not
bibliomania
at
all
or
at
least
were
what
we
of
the
faculty
call
false
or
chicken
bibliomania
in
false
bibliomania
which
says
is
the
primary
stage
of
the
grand
passion
the
vestibule
to
the
main
edifice
the
usual
symptoms
are
flushed
cheeks
sparkling
eyes
a
bounding
pulse
and
quick
respiration
this
period
of
exaltation
is
not
unfrequently
followed
by
a
condition
of
collapse
in
which
we
find
the
victim
pale
pulseless
and
dejected
he
is
pursued
and
tormented
of
imaginary
horrors
he
reproaches
himself
for
imaginary
crimes
and
he
implores
piteously
for
relief
from
fancied
dangers
the
sufferer
now
stands
in
a
slippery
place
unless
his
case
is
treated
intelligently
he
will
issue
from
that
period
of
gloom
cured
of
the
sweetest
of
madnesses
and
doomed
to
a
life
of
singular
uselessness
but
properly
treated
continues
and
particularly
if
his
spiritual
needs
be
ministered
to
he
can
be
brought
safely
through
this
period
of
collapse
into
a
condition
of
reenforced
exaltation
which
is
the
true
or
secondary
stage
of
bibliomania
and
for
which
there
is
no
cure
known
to
humanity
i
should
trust
judgment
in
this
matter
even
if
i
did
not
know
from
experience
that
it
was
true
for
is
the
most
famous
authority
we
have
in
bibliomania
and
kindred
maladies
it
is
he
i
make
the
information
known
at
the
risk
of
offending
the
ethics
of
the
profession
it
is
he
who
discovered
the
bacillus
librorum
and
what
is
still
more
important
and
still
more
to
his
glory
it
is
he
who
invented
that
subtle
lymph
which
is
now
everywhere
employed
by
the
profession
as
a
diagnostic
where
the
presence
of
the
germs
of
bibliomania
in
other
words
bacilli
librorum
is
suspected
i
once
got
this
learned
scientist
to
inject
a
milligram
of
the
lymph
into
the
femoral
artery
of
miss
susan
cat
within
an
hour
the
precocious
beast
surreptitiously
entered
my
library
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
and
ate
the
covers
of
my
pet
edition
of
rabelais
this
demonstrated
to
satisfaction
the
efficacy
of
his
diagnostic
and
it
proved
to
judge
methuen
satisfaction
what
the
judge
has
always
maintained
that
rabelais
was
an
old
rat
xii
the
pleasures
of
very
many
years
ago
we
became
convinced
judge
methuen
and
i
did
that
there
was
nothing
new
in
the
world
i
think
it
was
while
we
were
in
london
and
while
we
were
deep
in
the
many
fads
of
bibliomania
that
we
arrived
at
this
important
conclusion
we
had
been
pursuing
with
enthusiasm
the
exciting
delights
of
a
practice
sometimes
known
as
grangerism
the
friends
of
the
practice
call
it
by
the
former
name
the
enemies
by
the
latter
we
were
engaged
at
boswell
life
of
johnson
and
had
already
got
together
somewhat
more
than
eleven
thousand
prints
when
we
ran
against
a
snag
an
obstacle
we
never
could
surmount
we
agreed
that
our
work
would
be
incomplete
and
therefore
vain
unless
we
secured
a
picture
of
the
book
with
which
the
great
lexicographer
knocked
down
osborne
the
bookseller
at
gray
inn
gate
unhappily
we
were
wholly
in
the
dark
as
to
what
the
title
of
that
book
was
and
although
we
ransacked
the
british
museum
and
even
appealed
to
the
learned
frognall
dibdin
we
could
not
get
a
clew
to
the
identity
of
the
volume
to
be
wholly
frank
with
you
i
will
say
that
both
the
judge
and
i
had
wearied
of
the
occupation
moreover
it
involved
great
expense
since
we
were
content
with
nothing
but
india
proofs
those
before
letters
preferred
so
we
were
glad
of
this
excuse
for
abandoning
the
practice
while
we
were
contemplating
a
graceful
retreat
the
judge
happened
to
discover
in
the
natural
history
of
pliny
a
passage
which
proved
to
our
satisfaction
that
so
far
from
being
a
new
or
a
modern
thing
the
of
books
was
of
exceptional
antiquity
it
seems
that
atticus
the
friend
of
cicero
wrote
a
book
on
the
subject
of
portraits
and
in
the
course
of
which
treatise
he
mentions
that
marcus
varro
conceived
the
very
liberal
idea
of
inserting
by
some
means
or
another
in
his
numerous
volumes
the
portraits
of
several
hundred
individuals
as
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
that
all
traces
of
their
features
should
be
lost
or
that
the
lapse
of
centuries
should
get
the
better
of
mankind
thus
says
pliny
was
he
the
inventor
of
a
benefit
to
his
that
might
have
been
envied
by
the
gods
themselves
for
not
only
did
he
confer
immortality
upon
the
originals
of
these
portraits
but
he
transmitted
these
portraits
to
all
parts
of
the
earth
so
that
everywhere
it
might
be
possible
for
them
to
be
present
and
for
each
to
occupy
his
niche
now
pliny
is
not
the
only
one
who
has
contributed
to
the
immortalization
of
marcus
varro
i
have
had
among
my
papers
for
thirty
years
the
verses
which
judge
methuen
dashed
off
for
poets
invariably
dash
off
their
poetry
and
they
are
such
pleasant
verses
that
i
mind
letting
the
world
see
them
marcus
varro
marcus
varro
went
up
and
down
the
places
where
old
books
were
sold
he
ransacked
all
the
shops
in
town
for
pictures
new
and
pictures
old
he
gave
the
folk
of
earth
no
peace
snooping
around
by
day
and
night
he
plied
the
trade
in
rome
and
greece
of
an
insatiate
grangerite
pictures
was
evermore
his
cry
pictures
of
old
or
recent
date
and
pictures
only
would
he
buy
wherewith
to
full
many
a
tome
of
ancient
type
and
many
a
manuscript
he
took
for
nary
purpose
but
to
swipe
their
pictures
for
some
other
book
while
marcus
varro
plied
his
fad
there
was
not
in
the
shops
of
greece
a
book
or
pamphlet
to
be
had
that
was
not
minus
frontispiece
nor
did
he
hesitate
to
ply
his
baleful
practices
at
home
it
was
not
possible
to
buy
a
perfect
book
in
all
of
rome
what
must
the
other
folk
have
done
who
glancing
the
books
they
bought
came
soon
and
suddenly
upon
the
vandalism
varro
wrought
how
must
their
cheeks
have
flamed
with
red
how
did
their
hearts
with
choler
beat
we
can
imagine
what
they
said
we
can
imagine
not
repeat
where
are
the
books
that
varro
made
the
pride
of
dilettante
rome
with
divers
portraitures
inlaid
swiped
from
so
many
another
tome
the
worms
devoured
them
long
ago
o
wretched
worms
ye
should
have
fed
not
on
the
books
extended
so
but
on
old
varro
flesh
instead
alas
that
marcus
varro
lives
and
is
a
potent
factor
yet
alas
that
still
his
practice
gives
good
men
occasion
for
regret
to
yonder
bookstall
go
and
by
the
missing
prints
and
plates
and
frontispieces
you
shall
know
he
lives
and
in
justice
to
the
judge
and
to
myself
i
should
say
that
neither
of
us
wholly
approves
the
sentiment
which
the
poem
i
have
quoted
implies
we
regard
grangerism
as
one
of
the
unfortunate
stages
in
bibliomania
it
is
a
period
which
seldom
covers
more
than
five
years
although
has
met
with
one
case
in
his
practice
that
has
lasted
ten
years
and
still
gives
no
symptom
of
abating
in
virulence
humanity
invariably
condones
the
pranks
of
youth
on
the
broad
and
charitable
grounds
that
boys
will
be
boys
so
we
bibliomaniacs
are
prone
to
wink
at
the
follies
of
the
grangerite
for
we
know
that
he
will
know
better
by
and
by
and
will
heartily
repent
of
the
mischief
he
has
done
we
know
the
power
of
books
so
well
that
we
know
that
no
man
can
have
to
do
with
books
that
presently
he
does
not
love
them
he
may
at
first
endure
them
then
he
may
come
only
to
pity
them
anon
as
surely
as
the
morrow
sun
riseth
he
shall
embrace
and
love
those
precious
things
so
we
say
that
we
would
put
no
curb
upon
any
man
it
being
better
that
many
books
should
be
destroyed
if
ultimately
by
that
destruction
a
penitent
and
loyal
soul
be
added
to
the
roster
of
bibliomaniacs
there
is
more
joy
over
one
grangerite
that
repenteth
than
over
ninety
and
nine
just
men
that
need
no
repentance
and
we
have
a
similar
feeling
toward
such
of
our
number
as
for
the
nonce
become
imbued
with
a
passion
for
any
of
the
other
little
fads
which
bibliomaniac
flesh
is
heir
to
all
the
soldiers
in
an
army
can
not
be
foot
or
horse
or
captains
or
majors
or
generals
or
artillery
or
ensigns
or
drummers
or
buglers
each
one
has
his
place
to
fill
and
his
part
to
do
and
the
consequence
is
a
concinnate
whole
bibliomania
is
beautiful
as
an
entirety
as
a
symmetrical
blending
of
a
multitude
of
component
parts
and
he
is
indeed
disloyal
to
the
cause
who
through
envy
or
shortsightedness
or
ignorance
argues
to
the
discredit
of
angling
or
napoleonana
or
balladry
or
indians
or
burns
or
americana
or
any
other
branch
or
phase
of
bibliomania
for
each
of
these
things
accomplishes
a
noble
purpose
in
that
each
contributes
to
the
glory
of
the
great
common
cause
of
bibliomania
which
is
indeed
the
summum
bonum
of
human
life
i
have
heard
many
decried
who
indulged
their
fancy
for
bookplates
as
if
forsooth
if
a
man
loved
his
books
he
should
not
lavish
upon
them
testimonials
of
his
affection
who
that
loves
his
wife
should
hesitate
to
buy
adornments
for
her
person
i
favor
everything
that
tends
to
prove
that
the
human
heart
is
swayed
by
the
tenderer
emotions
gratitude
is
surely
one
of
the
noblest
emotions
of
which
humanity
is
capable
and
he
is
indeed
unworthy
of
our
respect
who
would
forbid
humanity
expressing
in
every
dignified
and
reverential
manner
its
gratitude
for
the
benefits
conferred
by
the
companionship
of
books
as
for
myself
i
urge
upon
all
lovers
of
books
to
provide
themselves
with
bookplates
whenever
i
see
a
book
that
bears
its
owner
plate
i
feel
myself
obligated
to
treat
that
book
with
special
consideration
it
carries
with
it
a
certificate
of
its
master
love
the
bookplate
gives
the
volume
a
certain
status
it
would
not
otherwise
have
time
and
again
i
have
fished
musty
books
out
of
bins
in
front
of
bookstalls
bought
them
and
borne
them
home
with
me
simply
because
they
had
upon
their
covers
the
bookplates
of
their
former
owners
i
have
a
case
filled
with
these
aristocratic
estrays
and
i
insist
that
they
shall
be
as
carefully
dusted
and
kept
as
my
other
books
and
i
have
provided
in
my
will
for
their
perpetual
maintenance
after
my
decease
if
i
were
a
rich
man
i
should
found
a
hospital
for
homeless
aristocratic
books
an
institution
similar
in
all
essential
particulars
to
the
institution
which
is
now
operated
at
our
national
capital
under
the
bequest
of
the
late
cochrane
i
should
name
it
the
home
for
genteel
volumes
in
decayed
circumstances
i
was
a
young
man
when
i
adopted
the
bookplate
which
i
am
still
using
and
which
will
be
found
in
all
my
books
i
drew
the
design
myself
and
had
it
executed
by
a
son
of
anderson
the
first
of
american
engravers
it
is
by
no
means
elaborate
a
book
rests
upon
a
heart
and
underneath
appear
the
lines
my
book
and
heart
must
never
part
ah
little
puritan
maid
with
thy
dear
eyes
of
honest
blue
and
thy
fair
hair
in
proper
plaits
adown
thy
back
little
thought
we
that
springtime
long
ago
back
among
the
new
england
hills
that
the
tiny
book
we
read
together
should
follow
me
through
all
my
life
what
a
part
has
that
primer
played
and
now
all
these
other
beloved
companions
bear
witness
to
the
love
i
bear
that
primer
and
its
teachings
for
each
wears
the
emblem
i
plucked
from
its
homely
pages
that
was
in
the
springtime
captivity
waite
anon
came
summer
with
all
its
exuberant
glory
and
presently
the
cheery
autumn
stole
upon
me
and
now
it
is
the
and
under
the
snows
lies
buried
many
a
sweet
fair
thing
i
cherished
once
i
am
aweary
and
will
rest
a
little
while
lie
thou
there
my
pen
for
a
dream
a
pleasant
dream
calleth
me
away
i
shall
see
those
distant
hills
again
and
the
homestead
under
the
elms
the
old
associations
and
the
old
influences
shall
be
round
about
me
and
a
child
shall
lead
me
and
we
shall
go
together
through
green
pastures
and
by
still
waters
and
o
my
pen
it
will
be
the
springtime
again
xiii
on
the
odors
which
my
books
exhale
have
you
ever
come
out
of
the
thick
smoky
atmosphere
of
the
town
into
the
fragrant
gracious
atmosphere
of
a
library
if
you
have
you
know
how
grateful
the
change
is
and
you
will
agree
with
me
when
i
say
that
nothing
else
is
so
quieting
to
the
nerves
so
conducive
to
physical
health
and
so
quick
to
restore
a
lively
flow
of
the
spirits
lafcadio
hearn
once
wrote
a
treatise
upon
perfumes
an
ingenious
and
scholarly
performance
he
limited
the
edition
to
fifty
copies
and
published
it
privately
so
the
book
is
rarely
met
with
curiously
enough
however
this
author
had
nothing
to
say
in
the
book
about
the
smells
of
books
which
i
regard
as
a
most
unpardonable
error
unless
properly
estimating
the
subject
to
be
worthy
of
a
separate
treatise
he
has
postponed
its
consideration
and
treatment
to
a
time
when
he
can
devote
the
requisite
study
and
care
to
it
we
have
it
upon
the
authority
of
william
blades
that
books
breathe
however
the
testimony
of
experts
is
not
needed
upon
this
point
for
if
anybody
be
sceptical
all
he
has
to
do
to
convince
himself
is
to
open
a
door
of
a
bookcase
at
any
time
and
his
olfactories
will
be
greeted
by
an
outrush
of
odors
that
will
prove
to
him
beyond
all
doubt
that
books
do
actually
consume
air
and
exhale
perfumes
visitors
to
the
british
museum
complain
not
unfrequently
that
they
are
overcome
by
the
closeness
of
the
atmosphere
in
that
place
and
what
is
known
as
the
british
museum
headache
has
come
to
be
recognized
by
the
medical
profession
in
london
as
a
specific
ailment
due
to
the
absence
of
oxygen
in
the
atmosphere
which
condition
is
caused
by
the
multitude
of
books
each
one
of
which
by
that
breathing
process
peculiar
to
books
consumes
several
thousand
cubic
feet
of
air
every
hours
professor
huxley
wondered
for
a
long
time
why
the
atmosphere
of
the
british
museum
should
be
poisonous
while
other
libraries
were
free
from
the
poison
a
series
of
experiments
convinced
him
that
the
presence
of
poison
in
the
atmosphere
was
due
to
the
number
of
profane
books
in
the
museum
he
recommended
that
these
volumes
be
treated
once
every
six
months
with
a
bath
of
cedria
which
as
i
understand
is
a
solution
of
the
juices
of
the
cedar
tree
this
he
said
would
purge
the
mischievous
volumes
temporarily
of
their
evil
propensities
and
abilities
i
do
not
know
whether
this
remedy
is
effective
but
i
remember
to
have
read
in
pliny
that
cedria
was
used
by
the
ancients
to
render
their
manuscripts
imperishable
when
cneius
terentius
went
digging
in
his
estate
in
the
janiculum
he
came
upon
a
coffer
which
contained
not
only
the
remains
of
numa
the
old
roman
king
but
also
the
manuscripts
of
the
famous
laws
which
numa
compiled
the
king
was
in
some
such
condition
as
you
might
suppose
him
to
be
after
having
been
buried
several
centuries
but
the
manuscripts
were
as
fresh
as
new
and
their
being
so
is
said
to
have
been
due
to
the
fact
that
before
their
burial
they
were
rubbed
with
citrus
leaves
these
books
of
numa
would
perhaps
have
been
preserved
unto
this
day
but
for
the
fanaticism
of
the
people
who
exhumed
and
read
them
they
were
promptly
burned
by
quintus
petilius
the
praetor
because
as
cassius
hemina
explains
they
treated
of
philosophical
subjects
or
because
as
livy
testifies
their
doctrines
were
inimical
to
the
religion
then
existing
as
i
have
had
little
to
do
with
profane
literature
i
know
nothing
of
the
habits
of
such
books
as
professor
huxley
has
prescribed
an
antidote
against
of
such
books
as
i
have
gathered
about
me
and
made
my
constant
companions
i
can
say
truthfully
that
a
more
lot
it
were
impossible
to
find
as
i
walk
amongst
them
touching
first
this
one
and
then
that
and
regarding
all
with
glances
of
affectionate
approval
i
fancy
that
i
am
walking
in
a
splendid
garden
full
of
charming
vistas
wherein
parterre
after
parterre
of
beautiful
flowers
is
unfolded
to
my
enraptured
vision
and
surely
there
never
were
other
odors
so
delightful
as
the
odors
which
my
books
exhale
my
garden
aboundeth
in
pleasant
nooks
and
fragrance
is
over
it
all
for
sweet
is
the
smell
of
my
old
old
books
in
their
places
against
the
wall
here
is
a
folio
that
grim
with
age
and
yellow
and
green
with
mould
there
the
breath
of
the
sea
on
every
page
and
the
hint
of
a
stanch
ship
hold
and
here
is
a
treasure
from
france
la
belle
exhaleth
a
faint
perfume
of
wedded
lily
and
asphodel
in
a
garden
of
song
abloom
and
this
wee
little
book
of
puritan
mien
and
rude
conspicuous
print
hath
the
yankee
flavor
of
wintergreen
or
may
be
of
peppermint
in
walton
the
brooks
tell
where
the
cheery
daisy
grows
and
where
in
meadow
or
woodland
dwell
the
buttercup
and
the
rose
but
best
beloved
of
books
i
ween
are
those
which
one
perceives
are
hallowed
by
ashes
dropped
between
the
yellow
leaves
for
it
here
a
laugh
and
it
there
a
tear
till
the
treasured
book
is
read
and
the
ashes
betwixt
the
pages
here
tell
us
of
one
long
dead
but
the
gracious
presence
reappears
as
we
read
the
book
again
and
the
fragrance
of
precious
distant
years
filleth
the
hearts
of
men
come
pluck
with
me
in
my
garden
nooks
the
posies
that
bloom
for
all
oh
sweet
is
the
smell
of
my
old
old
books
in
their
places
against
the
wall
better
than
flowers
are
they
these
books
of
mine
for
what
are
the
seasons
to
them
neither
can
the
drought
of
summer
nor
the
asperity
of
winter
wither
or
change
them
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
they
are
the
same
radiant
fragrant
hopeful
helpful
there
is
no
charm
which
they
do
not
possess
no
beauty
that
is
not
theirs
what
wonder
is
it
that
from
time
immemorial
humanity
has
craved
the
boon
of
carrying
to
the
grave
some
book
particularly
beloved
in
life
even
numa
pompilius
provided
that
his
books
should
share
his
tomb
with
him
of
these
precious
volumes
were
consigned
with
him
to
the
grave
when
gabriel
rossetti
wife
died
the
poet
cast
into
her
open
grave
the
unfinished
volume
of
his
poems
that
being
the
last
and
most
precious
tribute
he
could
pay
to
her
cherished
memory
history
records
instance
after
instance
of
the
consolation
dying
men
have
received
from
the
perusal
of
books
and
many
a
one
has
made
his
end
holding
in
his
hands
a
particularly
beloved
volume
the
reverence
which
even
unlearned
men
have
for
books
appeals
in
these
splendid
libraries
which
are
erected
now
and
again
with
funds
provided
by
the
wills
of
the
illiterate
how
dreadful
must
be
the
last
moments
of
that
person
who
has
steadfastly
refused
to
share
the
companionship
and
acknowledge
the
saving
grace
of
books
such
indeed
is
my
regard
for
these
friendships
that
it
is
with
misery
that
i
contemplate
the
probability
of
separation
from
them
by
and
by
i
have
given
my
friends
to
understand
that
when
i
am
done
with
earth
certain
of
my
books
shall
be
buried
with
me
the
list
of
these
books
will
be
found
in
the
upper
drawer
of
the
old
mahogany
secretary
in
the
front
spare
room
when
i
am
done
i
have
no
son
pounce
on
these
treasures
like
a
vulture
nay
give
them
half
my
epitaph
and
let
them
share
in
my
sepulture
then
when
the
crack
of
doom
rolls
back
the
marble
and
the
earth
that
hide
me
i
smuggle
home
each
precious
tome
without
a
fear
a
wife
shall
chide
me
the
dread
of
being
separated
by
death
from
the
objects
of
one
love
has
pursued
humanity
from
the
beginning
the
hindoos
used
to
have
a
selfish
fashion
of
requiring
their
widows
to
be
entombed
alive
with
their
corpses
the
north
american
indian
insists
that
his
horse
his
bow
and
arrows
his
spear
and
his
other
cherished
trinkets
shall
share
his
grave
with
him
my
sister
miss
susan
has
provided
that
after
her
demise
a
number
of
her
most
prized
curios
shall
be
buried
with
her
the
list
as
i
recall
it
includes
a
mahogany
bedstead
an
empire
dresser
a
brass
a
pair
of
brass
andirons
a

a
mayflower

a

a

a

candlesticks
a

a
tall

a
complete
suit
of
armor
purchased
in
rome
and
a
collection
of
japanese
presented
to
miss
susan
by
a
returned
missionary
i
do
not
see
what
miss
susan
can
possibly
do
with
all
this
trumpery
in
the
hereafter
but
if
i
survive
her
i
shall
certainly
insist
upon
a
compliance
with
her
wishes
even
though
it
involve
the
erection
of
a
tumulus
as
prodigious
as
the
pyramid
of
cheops
xiv
elzevirs
and
divers
other
matters
boswell
life
of
johnson
and
lockhart
life
of
scott
are
accepted
as
the
models
of
biography
the
third
remarkable
performance
in
this
line
is
gordon
memoir
of
her
father
john
wilson
a
volume
so
charmingly
and
tenderly
written
as
to
be
of
interest
to
those
even
who
know
and
care
little
about
that
era
in
the
history
of
english
literature
in
which
crusty
christopher
and
his
associates
in
the
making
of
blackwood
figured
it
is
a
significant
fact
i
think
that
the
three
greatest
biographers
the
world
has
known
should
have
been
scotch
it
has
long
been
the
fashion
to
laugh
and
to
sneer
at
what
is
called
scotch
dulness
yet
what
prodigies
has
not
scotch
genius
performed
in
every
department
of
literature
and
would
not
our
literature
be
poor
indeed
but
for
the
contributions
which
have
been
made
to
it
by
the
very
people
whom
we
affect
to
deride
john
wilson
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
figures
of
a
time
when
learning
was
at
a
premium
he
was
a
big
man
amongst
big
men
and
even
in
this
irreverential
time
genius
uncovers
at
the
mention
of
his
name
his
versatility
was
astounding
with
equal
facility
and
felicity
he
could
conduct
a
literary
symposium
and
a
a
theological
discussion
and
an
angling
expedition
a
historical
or
a
political
inquiry
and
a
fisticuffs
nature
had
provided
him
with
a
mighty
brain
in
a
powerful
body
he
had
a
physique
equal
to
the
performance
of
what
suggestion
soever
his
splendid
intellectuals
made
to
him
the
incredible
feat
of
walking
seventy
miles
within
the
compass
of
a
day
was
mere
child
play
then
when
the
printer
became
clamorous
he
would
immure
himself
in
his
wonderful
den
and
reel
off
copy
until
that
printer
cried
hold
enough
it
was
no
unusual
thing
for
him
to
write
for
thirteen
hours
at
a
stretch
when
he
worked
he
worked
and
when
he
played
he
played
that
is
perhaps
the
reason
why
he
was
never
a
dull
boy
wilson
seems
to
have
been
a
procrastinator
he
would
put
off
his
task
to
the
very
last
moment
this
is
a
practice
that
is
common
with
literary
men
in
fact
it
was
encouraged
by
those
who
were
regarded
as
authorities
in
such
matters
anciently
ringelbergius
gave
this
advice
to
an
author
under
his
tuition
tell
the
printers
said
he
to
make
preparations
for
a
work
you
intend
writing
and
never
alarm
yourself
about
it
because
it
is
not
even
begun
for
after
having
announced
it
you
may
without
difficulty
trace
out
in
your
own
head
the
whole
plan
of
your
work
and
its
divisions
after
which
compose
the
arguments
of
the
chapters
and
i
can
assure
you
that
in
this
manner
you
may
furnish
the
printers
daily
with
more
copy
than
they
want
but
remember
when
you
have
once
begun
there
must
be
no
flagging
till
the
work
is
finished
the
loyalty
of
human
admiration
was
never
better
illustrated
than
in
shelton
mackenzie
devotion
to
wilson
genius
to
mackenzie
we
are
indebted
for
a
compilation
of
the
noctes
ambrosianae
edited
with
such
discrimination
such
ability
such
learning
and
such
enthusiasm
that
it
seems
to
me
the
work
must
endure
as
a
monument
not
only
to
wilson
but
also
to
mackenzie
genius
i
have
noticed
one
peculiarity
that
distinguishes
many
admirers
of
the
noctes
they
seldom
care
to
read
anything
else
in
the
noctes
they
find
a
response
to
the
demand
of
every
mood
it
is
much
the
same
way
with
lovers
of
father
prout
divides
his
adoration
between
old
kit
north
and
the
sage
of
watergrass
hill
to
be
bitten
of
either
mania
is
bad
enough
when
one
is
possessed
at
the
same
time
of
a
passion
both
for
the
noctes
and
for
the
reliques
hopeless
indeed
is
his
malady
is
so
deep
under
the
spell
of
crusty
christopher
and
the
corkonian
pere
that
he
not
only
buys
every
copy
of
the
noctes
and
of
the
reliques
he
comes
across
but
insists
upon
giving
copies
of
these
books
to
everybody
in
his
acquaintance
i
have
even
known
him
to
prescribe
one
or
the
other
of
these
works
to
patients
of
his
i
recall
that
upon
one
occasion
having
lost
an
elzevir
at
a
book
auction
i
was
afflicted
with
melancholia
to
such
a
degree
that
i
had
to
take
to
my
bed
upon
my
physician
arrival
he
made
as
is
his
custom
a
careful
inquiry
into
my
condition
and
into
the
causes
inducing
it
finally
you
are
afflicted
said
with
the

which
fortunately
is
at
present
confined
to
the

renouard
says
how
few
are
there
of
those
who
esteem
and
pay
so
dearly
for
these
pretty
editions
who
know
that
the
type
that
so
much
please
them
are
the
work
of
francis
garamond
who
cast
them
one
hundred
years
before
at
paris
in
his
bibliographical
notes
a
volume
seldom
met
with
now
the
learned
william
davis
records
that
louis
elzevir
was
the
first
who
observed
the
distinction
between
the
v
consonant
and
the
u
vowel
which
distinction
however
had
been
recommended
long
before
by
ramus
and
other
writers
but
had
never
been
regarded
there
were
five
of
these
elzevirs
viz
louis
bonaventure
abraham
louis
and
daniel
a
hundred
years
ago
a
famous
bibliophile
remarked
the
diminutiveness
of
a
large
portion
and
the
beauty
of
the
whole
of
the
classics
printed
by
the
elzevirs
at
leyden
and
amsterdam
have
long
rendered
them
justly
celebrated
and
the
prices
they
bear
in
public
sales
sufficiently
demonstrate
the
estimation
in
which
they
are
at
present
held
the
regard
for
these
precious
books
still
obtains
and
we
meet
with
it
in
curiously
places
as
well
as
in
those
libraries
where
one
would
naturally
expect
to
find
it
my
young
friend
irving
way
himself
a
collector
of
rare
enthusiasm
tells
me
that
recently
during
a
pilgrimage
through
the
state
of
texas
he
came
upon
a
gentleman
who
showed
him
in
his
modest
home
the
most
superb
collection
of
elzevirs
he
had
ever
set
eyes
upon
how
is
thy
grace
o
bibliomania
how
good
and
sweet
it
is
that
no
distance
no
environment
no
poverty
no
distress
can
appall
or
stay
thee
like
that
grim
spectre
we
call
death
thou
knockest
impartially
at
the
palace
portal
and
at
the
cottage
door
and
it
seemeth
thy
especial
delight
to
bring
unto
the
lonely
in
desert
places
the
companionship
that
exalteth
humanity
it
makes
me
groan
to
think
of
the
number
of
elzevirs
that
are
lost
in
the
libraries
of
rich
parvenus
who
know
nothing
of
and
care
no
thing
for
the
treasures
about
them
further
than
a
certain
vulgar
vanity
which
is
involved
when

narrated
of
a

british
warrior
that
upon

retirement
from

he
bought
a
library
en
bloc
and
not
knowing
any
more
about
books
than
a
peccary

of

of

met
him

gibbon
was
carrying
the
volume
and
anticipating
the
joy
of
the
duke
upon
its
arrival
what
did
the
duke
say
what
he
cried
ah
another
big
square
book
eh
it
is
the
fashion
nowadays
to
harp
upon
the
degeneracy
of
humanity
to
insist
that
taste
is
corrupted
and
that
the
faculty
of
appreciation
is
dead
we
seem
incapable
of
realizing
that
this
is
the
golden
age
of
authors
if
not
the
golden
age
of
authorship
in
the
good
old
days
authors
were
in
fact
a
despised
and
neglected
class
the
greeks
put
them
to
death
as
the
humor
seized
them
for
a
hundred
years
after
his
death
shakespeare
was
practically
unknown
to
his
countrymen
except
suckling
and
his
coterie
during
his
life
he
was
roundly
assailed
by
his
contemporaries
one
of
the
latter
going
to
the
extreme
of
denouncing
him
as
a
daw
that
strutted
in
borrowed
plumage
milton
was
accused
of
plagiarism
and
one
of
his
critics
devoted
many
years
to
compiling
from
every
quarter
passages
in
ancient
works
which
bore
a
similarity
to
the
blind
poet
verses
even
samuel
satire
of
london
was
pronounced
a
plagiarism
the
good
old
days
were
the
days
seemingly
when
the
critics
had
their
way
and
ran
things
with
a
high
hand
they
made
or
unmade
books
and
authors
they
killed
chatterton
just
as
some
years
later
they
hastened
the
death
of
keats
for
a
time
they
were
it
was
not
until
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
that
these
professional
tyrants
began
to
lose
their
grip
and
when
byron
took
up
the
lance
against
them
their
doom
was
practically
sealed
who
would
care
a
picayune
in
these
degenerate
days
what
warburton
said
pro
or
con
a
book
it
was
warburton
then
bishop
of
gloucester
who
remarked
of
granger
biographical
history
of
england
that
it
was
an
odd
one
this
was
as
high
a
compliment
as
he
ever
paid
a
book
those
which
he
did
not
like
he
called
sad
books
and
those
which
he
fancied
he
called
odd
ones
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
through
the
diffusion
of
knowledge
and
the
multiplicity
and
cheapness
of
books
people
generally
have
reached
the
point
in
intelligence
where
they
feel
warranted
in
asserting
their
ability
to
judge
for
themselves
so
the
occupation
of
the
critic
as
interpreted
and
practised
of
old
is
gone
reverting
to
the
practice
of
lamenting
the
degeneracy
of
humanity
i
should
say
that
the
fashion
is
by
no
means
a
new
one
search
the
records
of
the
ancients
and
you
will
find
the
same
harping
upon
the
one
string
of
present
decay
and
former
virtue

are

distinct

of

those
who
contemplate
the
past
those
who
contemplate
the
present
those
who
contemplate
the
future
i
am
of
those
who
believe
that
humanity
progresses
and
it
is
my
theory
that
the
best
works
of
the
past
have
survived
and
come
down
to
us
in
these
books
which
are
our
dearest
legacies
our
proudest
possessions
and

companions
xv
a
book
that
brings
solace
and
cheer
one
of
my
friends
had
a
mania
for
bunyan
once
upon
a
time
and
although
he
has
now
abandoned
that
fad
for
the
more
fashionable
passion
of
napoleonana
he
still
exhibits
with
evident
pride
the
many
editions
of
the
pilgrim
progress
he
gathered
together
years
ago
i
have
frequently
besought
him
to
give
me
one
of
his
copies
which
has
a
curious
frontispiece
illustrating
the
dangers
besetting
the
traveller
from
the
city
of
destruction
to
the
celestial
city
this
frontispiece
which
is
prettily
illuminated
occurs
in
virtue
edition
of
the
pilgrim
progress
the
book
itself
is
not
rare
but
it
is
hardly
procurable
in
perfect
condition
for
the
reason
that
the
colored
plate
is
so
pleasing
to
the
eye
that
few
have
been
able
to
resist
the
temptation
to
make
away
with
it
for
similar
reasons
it
is
seldom
that
we
meet
with
a
perfect
edition
of
quarles
emblems
indeed
an
emblems
of
early
publication
that
does
not
lack
the
is
a
great
rarity
in
the
good
old
days
when
juvenile
books
were
few
the
works
of
bunyan
and
of
quarles
were
vastly
popular
with
the
little
folk
and
little
fingers
wrought
sad
havoc
with
the
and
the
pictures
that
with
their
extravagant
and
vivid
suggestions
appealed
so
directly
and
powerfully
to
the
youthful
fancy
coleridge
says
of
the
pilgrim
progress
that
it
is
the
best
summary
of
evangelical
christianity
ever
produced
by
a
writer
not
miraculously
inspired
froude
declares
that
it
has
for
two
centuries
affected
the
spiritual
opinions
of
the
english
race
in
every
part
of
the
world
more
powerfully
than
any
other
book
except
the
bible
it
is
says
macaulay
perhaps
the
only
book
about
which
after
the
lapse
of
a
hundred
years
the
educated
minority
has
come
over
to
the
opinion
of
the
common
people
whether
or
not
bunyan
is
as
has
called
him
the
spenser
of
the
people
and
whether
or
not
his
work
is
the
poetry
of
puritanism
the
best
evidence
of
the
merit
of
the
pilgrim
progress
appears
as
johnson
has
shrewdly
pointed
out
in
the
general
and
continued
approbation
of
mankind
southey
has
critically
observed
that
to
his
natural
style
bunyan
is
in
some
degree
beholden
for
his
general
popularity
his
language
being
everywhere
level
to
the
most
ignorant
reader
and
to
the
meanest
capacity
there
is
a
homely
reality
about
it
a
nursery
tale
is
not
more
intelligible
in
its
manner
of
narration
to
a
child
another
cause
of
his
popularity
says
southey
is
that
he
taxes
the
imagination
as
little
as
the
understanding
the
vividness
of
his
own
which
as
history
shows
sometimes
could
not
distinguish
ideal
impressions
from
actual
ones
occasioned
this
he
saw
the
things
of
which
he
was
writing
as
distinctly
with
his
mind
eye
as
if
they
were
indeed
passing
before
him
in
a
dream
it
is
clear
to
me
that
in
his
youth
bunyan
would
have
endeared
himself
to
me
had
i
lived
at
that
time
for
his
fancy
was
of
that
kind
and
of
such
intensity
as
i
delight
to
find
in
youth
my
sins
he
tells
us
did
so
offend
the
lord
that
even
in
my
childhood
he
did
scare
and
affright
me
with
fearful
dreams
and
did
terrify
me
with
dreadful
visions
i
have
been
in
my
bed
greatly
afflicted
while
asleep
with
apprehensions
of
devils
and
wicked
spirits
who
still
as
i
then
thought
labored
to
draw
me
away
with
them
of
which
i
could
never
be
rid
it
is
quite
likely
that
bunyan
overestimated
his
viciousness
one
of
his
ardent
intense
temperament
having
once
been
touched
of
the
saving
grace
could
hardly
help
recognizing
in
himself
the
most
miserable
of
sinners
it
is
related
that
upon
one
occasion
he
was
going
somewhere
disguised
as
a
wagoner
when
he
was
overtaken
by
a
constable
who
had
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
do
you
know
that
devil
of
a
fellow
bunyan
asked
the
constable
know
him
cried
bunyan
you
might
call
him
a
devil
indeed
if
you
knew
him
as
well
as
i
once
did
this
was
not
the
only
time
his
wit
served
him
to
good
purpose
on
another
occasion
a
certain
cambridge
student
who
was
filled
with
a
sense
of
his
own
importance
undertook
to
prove
to
him
what
a
divine
thing
reason
was
and
he
capped
his
argument
with
the
declaration
that
reason
was
the
chief
glory
of
man
which
distinguished
him
from
a
beast
to
this
bunyan
calmly
made
answer
sin
distinguishes
man
from
beast
is
sin
divine
frederick
saunders
observes
that
like
milton
in
his
blindness
bunyan
in
his
imprisonment
had
his
spiritual
perception
made
all
the
brighter
by
his
exclusion
from
the
glare
of
the
outside
world
and
of
the
great
debt
of
gratitude
we
all
owe
to
the
wicked
tinker
of
elstow
dean
stanley
has
spoken
so
truly
that
i
am
fain
to
quote
his
words
we
all
need
to
be
cheered
by
the
help
of
greatheart
and
standfast
and
and
good
old
honesty
some
of
us
have
been
in
doubting
castle
some
in
the
slough
of
despond
some
have
experienced
the
temptations
of
vanity
fair
all
of
us
have
to
climb
the
hill
of
difficulty
all
of
us
need
to
be
instructed
by
the
interpreter
in
the
house
beautiful
all
of
us
bear
the
same
burden
all
of
us
need
the
same
armor
in
our
fight
with
apollyon
all
of
us
have
to
pass
through
the
wicket
gate
to
pass
through
the
dark
river
and
for
all
of
us
if
god
so
will
there
wait
the
shining
ones
at
the
gates
of
the
celestial
city
who
does
not
love
to
linger
over
the
life
story
of
the
dreamer
as
one
of
those
characters
for
whom
man
has
done
so
little
and
god
so
much
about
my
favorite
copy
of
the
pilgrim
progress
many
a
pleasant
reminiscence
lingers
for
it
was
one
of
the
books
my
grandmother
gave
my
father
when
he
left
home
to
engage
in
the
great
battle
of
life
when
my
father
died
this
thick
dumpy
little
volume
with
its
rude
cuts
and
poorly
printed
pages
came
into
my
possession
i
do
not
know
what
part
this
book
played
in
my
father
life
but
i
can
say
for
myself
that
it
has
brought
me
solace
and
cheer
a
many
times
the
only
occasion
upon
which
i
felt
bitterly
toward
was
when
that
personage
observed
in
my
hearing
one
day
that
bunyan
was
a
dyspeptic
and
that
had
he
not
been
one
he
would
doubtless
never
have
written
the
pilgrim
progress
i
took
issue
with
the
doctor
on
this
point
whereupon
he
cited
those
visions
and
dreams
which
according
to
the
light
of
science
as
it
now
shines
demonstrate
that
bunyan
digestion
must
have
been
morbid
and
forthwith
he
overwhelmed
me
with
learned
instances
from
galen
and
hippocrates
from
spurzheim
and
binns
from
locke
and
beattie
from
malebranche
and
bertholini
from
darwin
and
descartes
from
charlevoix
and
berkeley
from
heraclitus
and
blumenbach
from
priestley
and
abercrombie
in
fact
forsooth
he
quoted
me
so
many
authorities
that
it
verily
seemed
to
me
as
though
the
whole
world
were
against
me
i
did
not
know
until
then
that
had
made
a
special
study
of
dreams
of
their
causes
and
of
their
signification
i
had
always
supposed
that
astrology
was
his
particular
hobby
in
which
science
i
will
concede
him
to
be
deeply
learned
even
though
he
has
never
yet
proved
to
my
entire
satisfaction
that
the
reason
why
my
copy
of
justinian
has
faded
from
a
royal
purple
to
a
pale
blue
is
first
because
the
binding
was
renewed
at
the
wane
of
the
moon
and
when
sirius
was
in
the
ascendant
and
secondly
because
as
has
discovered
my
binder
was
born
at
a
moment
years
ago
when
mercury
was
in
the
fourth
house
and
herschel
and
saturn
were
aspected
in
conjunction
with
sol
at
his
northern
declination
has
frequently
expressed
surprise
that
i
have
never
wearied
of
and
drifted
away
from
the
of
my
earlier
years
other
people
he
says
find
as
time
elapses
that
they
no
longer
discover
those
charms
in
certain
books
which
attracted
them
so
powerfully
in
youth
we
have
in
our
earlier
days
argues
the
doctor
friendships
so
dear
to
us
that
we
would
repel
with
horror
the
suggestion
that
we
could
ever
become
heedless
or
forgetful
of
them
yet
alas
as
we
grow
older
we
gradually
become
indifferent
to
these
first
friends
and
we
are
weaned
from
them
by
other
friendships
there
even
comes
a
time
when
we
actually
wonder
how
it
were
possible
for
us
to
be
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
such
or
such
a
person
we
grow
away
from
people
and
in
like
manner
and
for
similar
reasons
we
grow
away
from
books
is
it
indeed
possible
for
one
to
become
indifferent
to
an
object
he
has
once
loved
i
can
hardly
believe
so
at
least
it
is
not
so
with
me
and
even
though
the
time
may
come
when
i
shall
no
longer
be
able
to
enjoy
the
uses
of
these
dear
old
friends
with
the
enthusiasm
i
should
still
regard
them
with
that
tender
reverence
which
in
his
age
the
poet
longfellow
expressed
when
looking
round
upon
his
beloved
books
sadly
as
some
old
mediaeval
knight
gazed
at
the
arms
he
could
no
longer
wield
the
sword
and
the
shining
shield
suspended
in
the
hall
and
full
in
sight
while
secret
longings
for
the
lost
delight
of
tourney
or
adventure
in
the
field
came
over
him
and
tears
but
half
concealed
trembled
and
fell
upon
his
beard
of
white
so
i
behold
these
books
upon
their
shelf
my
ornaments
and
arms
of
other
days
not
wholly
useless
though
no
longer
used
for
they
remind
me
of
my
other
self
younger
and
stronger
and
the
pleasant
ways
in
which
i
walked
now
clouded
and
confused
if
my
friend
theory
be
true
how
barren
would
be
age
lord
bacon
tells
us
in
his
apothegms

alonzo

appeared

sir
john
davys
recalls
that
a
french
writer
whom
i
love
well
speaks
of
three
kinds
of
companions
men
women
and
books
and
my
revered
and
beloved
richard
henry
stoddard
has
wrought
out
this
sentiment
in
a
poem
of
exceeding
beauty
of
which
the
concluding
stanza
runs
in
this
wise
better
than
men
and
women
friend
that
are
dust
though
dear
in
our
joy
and
pain
are
the
books
their
cunning
hands
have
penned
for

depart
but
the
books
remain
through
these
they
speak
to
us
what
was
best
in
the
loving
heart
and
the
noble
mind
all
their
royal
souls
possessed
belongs
forever
to
all
mankind
when
others
fail
him
the
wise
man
looks
to
the
sure
companionship
of
books
if
ever
o
honest
friends
of
mine
i
should
forget
you
or
weary
of
your
companionship
whither
would
depart
the
memories
and
the
associations
with
which
each
of
you
is
hallowed
would
ever
the
modest
flowers
of
budding
in
pathways
where
i
no
longer
wander
recall
to
my
failing
sight
the
vernal
beauty
of
the
puritan

reverie

i
feel
again

ever
thy
ghost
come
back
from
out
those
years
away
off
yonder
be
hushed
my
beranger
for
a
moment
another
song
hath
awakened
softly
responsive
echoes
in
my
heart
it
is
a
song
of

in

in

the
malady
called
catalogitis
judge
methuen
tells
me
that
one
of
the
most
pleasing
delusions
he
has
experienced
in
his
long
and
active
career
as
a
bibliomaniac
is
that
which
is
born
of
the
catalogue
habit
presuming
that
there
are
among
my
readers
many
laymen
for
i
preach
salvation
to
the
heathen
i
will
explain
for
their
information
that
the
catalogue
habit
so
called
is
a
practice
to
which
the
confirmed
lover
of
books
is
likely
to
become
addicted
it
is
a
custom
of
many
publishers
and
dealers
to
publish
and
to
disseminate
at
certain
periods
lists
of
their
wares
in
the
hope
of
thereby
enticing
readers
to
buy
those
wares
by
what
means
these
crafty
tradesmen
secure
the
names
of
their
prospective
victims
i
can
not
say
but
this
i
know
full
well
that
there
seems
not
to
be
a
on
the
face
of
the
earth
i
care
not
how
remote
or
how
secret
his
habitation
may
be
that
these
dealers
do
not
presently
find
him
out
and
overwhelm
him
with
their
delightful
temptations
i
have
been
told
that
among
booksellers
there
exists
a
secret
league
which
provides
for
the
interchange
of
confidences
so
that
when
a
new
customer
enters
a
shop
in
the
fulham
road
or
in
oxford
street
or
along
the
quays
of
paris
or
it
matters
not
where
so
long
as
the
object
of
his
inquiry
be
a
book
within
the
space
of
a
month
that
man
name
and
place
of
residence
are
reported
to
and
entered
in
the
address
list
of
every
other
bookseller
in
christendom
and
forthwith
and
forever
after
the
catalogues
and
and
bulletins
of
publishers
and
dealers
in
every
part
of
the
world
are
pelted
at
him
through
the
unerring
processes
of
the
mails
judge
methuen
has
been
a
victim
a
pleasant
victim
to
the
catalogue
habit
for
the
last
forty
years
and
he
has
declared
that
if
all
the
catalogues
sent
to
and
read
by
him
in
that
space
of
time
were
gathered
together
in
a
heap
they
would
make
a
pile
bigger
than
pike
peak
and
a
thousandfold
more
interesting
i
myself
have
been
a
famous
reader
of
catalogues
and
i
can
testify
that
the
habit
has
possessed
me
of
remarkable
delusions
the
most
conspicuous
of
which
is
that
which
produces
within
me
the
conviction
that
a
book
is
as
good
as
mine
as
soon
as
i
have
met
with
its
title
in
a
catalogue
and
set
an
x
over
against
it
in
pencil
i
recall
that
on
one
occasion
i
was
discussing
with
judge
methuen
and
the
attempted
escapes
of
charles
from
carisbrooke
castle
a
point
of
difference
having
arisen
i
said
gentlemen
i
will
refer
to
hillier
and
i
doubt
not
that
my
argument
will
be
sustained
by
that
authority
it
was
vastly
easier
however
to
cite
hillier
than
it
was
to
find
him
for
three
days
i
searched
in
my
library
and
tumbled
my
books
about
in
that
confusion
which
results
from
undue
eagerness
was
all
in
vain
neither
hide
nor
hair
of
the
desired
volume
could
i
discover
it
finally
occurred
to
me
that
i
must
have
lent
the
book
to
somebody
and
then
again
i
felt
sure
that
it
had
been
stolen
no
tidings
of
the
missing
volume
came
to
me
and
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
incident
when
one
evening
it
was
fully
two
years
after
my
discussion
with
my
cronies
i
came
upon
in
one
of
the
drawers
of
my
oak
chest
a
sotheran
catalogue
of
may
by
the
merest
chance
i
opened
it
and
as
luck
would
have
it
i
opened
it
at
the
very
page
upon
which
appeared
this
item
hillier
of
the
attempted
escapes
of
charles
the
first
from
carisbrooke
castle
cr
cloth
against
this
item
appeared
a
cross
in
my
chirography
and
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
this
was
my
hillier
i
had
meant
to
buy
it
and
had
marked
it
for
purchase
but
with
the
determination
and
that
pencilled
cross
the
transaction
had
ended
yet
having
resolved
to
buy
it
had
served
me
almost
as
effectively
as
though
i
had
actually
bought
it
i
thought
aye
i
could
have
sworn
i
had
bought
it
simply
because
i
meant
to
buy
it
the
experience
is
not
unique
said
judge
methuen
when
i
narrated
it
to
him
at
our
next
meeting
speaking
for
myself
i
can
say
that
it
is
a
confirmed
habit
with
me
to
mark
certain
items
in
catalogues
which
i
read
and
then
to
go
my
way
in
the
pleasing
conviction
that
they
are
actually
mine
i
meet
with
cases
of
this
character
continually
said
the
hallucination
is
one
that
is
recognized
as
a
specific
one
by
pathologists
its
cure
is
quickest
effected
by
means
of
hypnotism
within
the
last
year
a
lady
of
beauty
and
refinement
came
to
me
in
serious
distress
she
confided
to
me
amid
a
copious
effusion
of
tears
that
her
husband
was
upon
the
verge
of
insanity
her
testimony
was
to
the
effect
that
the
unfortunate
man
believed
himself
to
be
possessed
of
a
large
library
the
fact
being
that
the
number
of
his
books
was
limited
to
three
hundred
or
thereabouts
upon
inquiry
i
learned
that
for
so
i
will
call
the
victim
of
this
delusion
made
a
practice
of
reading
and
of
marking
catalogues
further
investigation
developed
that
on
his
mother
side
had
invented
a
that
would
not
fly
and
that
a
of
his
was
the
author
of
a
pamphlet
entitled
to
or
the
poor
man
said
i
is
clear
to
me
that
your
husband
is
afflicted
with
catalogitis
at
this
the
poor
woman
went
into
hysterics
bewailing
that
she
should
have
lived
to
see
the
object
of
her
affection
the
victim
of
a
malady
so
grievous
as
to
require
a
greek
name
when
she
became
calmer
i
explained
to
her
that
the
malady
was
by
no
means
fatal
and
that
it
yielded
readily
to
treatment
what
in
plain
terms
asked
judge
methuen
is
catalogitis
i
will
explain
briefly
answered
the
doctor
you
must
know
first
that
every
perfect
human
being
is
provided
with
two
sets
of
bowels
he
has
physical
bowels
and
intellectual
bowels
the
brain
being
the
latter
hippocrates
since
whose
time
the
science
of
medicine
has
not
advanced
even
the
two
stadia
five
parasangs
of
xenophon
hippocrates
i
say
discovered
that
the
brain
is
subject
to
those
very
same
diseases
to
which
the
other
and
inferior
bowels
are
liable
galen
confirmed
this
discovery
and
he
records
a
case
lib
wherein
there
were
exhibited
in
the
intellectual
bowels
symptoms
similar
to
those
we
find
in
appendicitis
the
brain
is
wrought
into
certain
convolutions
just
as
the
alimentary
canal
is
the
fourth
layer
so
called
contains
elongated
groups
of
small
cells
or
nuclei
radiating
at
right
angles
to
its
plane
which
groups
present
a
distinctly
fanlike
structure
catalogitis
is
a
stoppage
of
this
fourth
layer
whereby
the
functions
of
the
fanlike
structure
are
suffered
no
longer
to
cool
the
brain
and
whereby
also
continuity
of
thought
is
interrupted
just
as
continuity
of
digestion
is
prevented
by
stoppage
of
the
vermiform
appendix
the
learned
professor
biersteintrinken
continued
has
advanced
in
his
scholarly
work
on
the
interesting
theory
that
catalogitis
is
produced
by
the
presence
in
the
brain
of
a
germ
which
has
its
origin
in
the
cheap
paper
used
by
booksellers
for
catalogue
purposes
and
this
theory
seems
to
have
the
approval
of
the
most
famous
of
authorities
on
inebriety
in
his
celebrated
classic
entitled
trait
sur
did
you
effect
a
cure
in
the
case
of
n
i
asked
with
the
greatest
of
ease
answered
the
doctor
by
means
of
hypnotism
i
purged
his
intellectuals
of
their
hallucination
relieving
them
of
their
perception
of
objects
which
have
no
reality
and
ridding
them
of
sensations
which
have
no
corresponding
external
cause
the
patient
made
a
rapid
recovery
and
although
three
months
have
elapsed
since
his
discharge
he
has
had
no
return
of
the
disease
as
a
class
booksellers
do
not
encourage
the
reading
of
other
booksellers
catalogues
this
is
presumably
because
they
do
not
care
to
encourage
buyers
to
buy
of
other
sellers
my
bookseller
who
in
all
virtues
of
head
and
heart
excels
all
other
booksellers
i
ever
met
with
makes
a
scrupulous
practice
of
destroying
the
catalogues
that
come
to
his
shop
lest
some
stray
copy
may
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
mousing
and
divert
his
attention
to
other
it
is
indeed
remarkable
to
what
excess
the
catalogue
habit
will
carry
its
victim
the
author
of
will
shakespeare
a
comedy
has
frequently
confessed
to
me
that
it
mattered
not
to
him
whether
a
catalogue
was
twenty
years
old
so
long
as
it
was
a
catalogue
of
books
he
found
the
keenest
delight
in
its
perusal
i
have
often
heard
hamlin
the
theatre
manager
say
that
he
preferred
old
catalogues
to
new
for
the
reason
that
the
bargains
to
be
met
with
in
old
catalogues
expired
long
ago
under
the
statute
of
limitations
judge
methuen
who
is
a
married
man
and
has
therefore
had
an
excellent
opportunity
to
study
the
sex
tells
me
that
the
wives
of
bibliomaniacs
regard
catalogues
as
the
most
mischievous
temptations
that
can
be
thrown
in
the
way
of
their
husbands
i
once
committed
the
imprudence
of
mentioning
the
subject
in
methuen
presence
that
estimable
lady
gave
it
as
her
opinion
that
there
were
plenty
of
ways
of
spending
money
foolishly
without
having
recourse
to
a
for
suggestion
i
wonder
whether
captivity
would
have
had
this
opinion
had
providence
ordained
that
we
should
walk
together
the
quiet
pathway
of
new
england
life
would
yseult
always
have
retained
the
exuberance
and
sweetness
of
her
youth
had
she
and
i
realized
what
might
have
been
would
fanchonette
always
have
sympathized
with
the
whims
and
vagaries
of
the
restless
yet
loyal
soul
that
hung
enraptured
on
her
singing
in
the
quartier
latin
so
long
ago
that
the
memory
of
that
song
is
like
the
memory
of
a
ghostly
echo
now
away
with
such
reflections
bring
in
the
candles
good
servitor
and
range
them
at
my
bed
head
sweet
avocation
awaits
me
for
here
i
have
a
goodly
parcel
of
catalogues
with
which
to
commune
they
are
messages
from
methuen
sotheran
libbie
irvine
hutt
davey
baer
crawford
bangs
mcclurg
matthews
francis
bouton
scribner
benjamin
and
a
score
of
other
friends
in
every
part
of
christendom
they
deserve
and
they
shall
have
my
respectful
nay
my
enthusiastic
attention
once
more
i
shall
seem
to
be
in
the
old
familiar
shops
where
treasures
abound
and
where
patient
delving
bringeth
rich
rewards
egad
what
a
spendthrift
i
shall
be
this
night
pence
shillings
thalers
marks
francs
dollars
sovereigns
they
are
the
same
to
me
then
after
i
have
comprehended
all
the
treasures
within
reach
how
sweet
shall
be
my
dreams
of
shelves
overflowing
with
the
wealth
of
which
my
fancy
has
possessed
me
then
shall
my
library
be
devote
to
the
magic
of
including
the
volumes
which
nobody
wrote
and
the
works
of
everybody
xvii
the
napoleonic
renaissance
if
i
had
begun
collecting
napoleonana
in
my
youth
i
should
now
have
on
hand
a
priceless
collection
this
reminds
me
that
when
i
first
came
to
chicago
suburban
property
along
the
north
shore
could
be
bought
for
five
hundred
dollars
an
acre
which
now
sells
for
two
hundred
dollars
a
front
foot
if
i
had
purchased
real
estate
in
that
locality
when
i
had
the
opportunity
forty
years
ago
i
should
be
a
millionnaire
at
the
present
time
i
think
i
am
more
regretful
of
having
neglected
the
napoleonana
than
of
having
missed
the
chances
for
since
my
library
contains
fewer
than
two
hundred
volumes
relating
to
bonaparte
and
his
times
i
feel
that
i
have
been
strangely
remiss
in
the
pursuit
of
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
most
instructive
of
bibliomaniac
fads
when
i
behold
the
remarkable
collections
of
napoleonana
made
by
certain
friends
of
mine
i
am
filled
with
conflicting
emotions
of
delight
and
envy
and
judge
methuen
and
i
are
wont
to
contemplate
with
regret
the
opportunities
we
once
had
of
throwing
all
these
modern
collections
in
the
shade
when
i
speak
of
napoleonana
i
refer
exclusively
to
literature
relating
to
napoleon
the
term
however
is
generally
used
in
a
broader
sense
and
includes
every
variety
of
object
from
the
used
by
the
emperor
at
malmaison
to
the
slippers
he
wore
at
helena
my
friend
redding
of
california
has
a
silver
knife
and
fork
that
once
belonged
to
bonaparte
and
mills
another
friend
of
mine
has
the
neckerchief
which
napoleon
wore
on
the
field
of
waterloo
in
le
blanc
little
treatise
upon
the
art
of
tying
the
cravat
it
is
recorded
that
napoleon
generally
wore
a
black
silk
cravat
as
was
remarked
at
wagram
lodi
marengo
and
austerlitz
but
at
waterloo
says
le
blanc
it
was
observed
that
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
he
wore
a
white
handkerchief
with
a
flowing
bow
although
the
day
previous
he
appeared
in
his
black
cravat
i
remember
to
have
seen
in
the
collection
of
melville
stone
a
which
having
been
brought
by
an
old
french
soldier
to
new
orleans
ultimately
found
its
way
to
a
this
bauble
was
of
gold
and
at
two
opposite
points
upon
its
outer
surface
appeared
a
napoleonic
n
done
in
black
enamel
by
pressing
upon
one
of
these
ns
a
secret
spring
was
operated
the
top
of
the
ring
flew
back
and
a
tiny
gold
figure
of
the
little
corporal
stood
up
to
the
astonishment
and
admiration
of
the
beholder
another
curious
napoleonic
souvenir
in
stone
motley
collection
is
a
cotton
print
handkerchief
upon
which
are
recorded
scenes
from
the
career
of
the
emperor
the
thing
must
have
been
of
english
manufacture
for
only
an
englishman
inspired
by
that
fear
and
that
hatred
of
bonaparte
which
only
englishmen
had
could
have
devised
this
atrocious
libel
one
has
to
read
the
literature
current
in
the
earlier
part
of
this
century
in
order
to
get
a
correct
idea
of
the
terror
with
which
bonaparte
filled
his
enemies
and
this
literature
is
so
extensive
that
it
seems
an
impossibility
that
anything
like
a
complete
collection
should
be
got
together
to
say
nothing
of
the
histories
the
biographies
the
volumes
of
reminiscence
and
the
books
of
criticism
which
the
career
of
the
corsican
inspired
there
are
napoleon
napoleon
napoleon
beyond
the
capability
of
enumeration
the
english
were
particularly
active
in
disseminating
libels
upon
napoleon
they
charged
him
in
their
books
and
pamphlets
with
murder
arson
incest
treason
treachery
cowardice
seduction
hypocrisy
avarice
robbery
ingratitude
and
jealousy
they
said
that
he
poisoned
his
sick
soldiers
that
he
was
the
father
of
hortense
child
that
he
committed
the
most
atrocious
cruelties
in
egypt
and
italy
that
he
married
barras
discarded
mistress
that
he
was
afflicted
with
a
loathsome
disease
that
he
murdered
the
duc
and
officers
in
his
own
army
of
whom
he
was
jealous
that
he
was
criminally
intimate
with
his
own
sisters
in
short
there
was
no
crime
however
revolting
with
which
these
calumniators
were
not
hasty
to
charge
the
emperor
this
same
vindictive
hatred
was
visited
also
upon
all
associated
with
bonaparte
in
the
conduct
of
affairs
at
that
time
murat
was
a
brute
and
a
thief
josephine
hortense
pauline
and
mme
letitia
were
courtesans
berthier
was
a
shuffling
lackey
and
tool
augereau
was
a
bastard
a
spy
a
robber
and
a
murderer
fouche
was
the
incarnation
of
every
vice
lucien
bonaparte
was
a
roue
and
a
marplot
cambaceres
was
a
debauchee
lannes
was
a
thief
brigand
and
a
poisoner
talleyrand
and
barras
were
well
what
evil
was
told
of
them
has
yet
to
be
disproved
but
you
would
gather
from
contemporaneous
english
publications
that
bonaparte
and
his
associates
were
veritable
fiends
from
hell
sent
to
scourge
civilization
these
books
are
so
strangely
curious
that
we
find
it
hard
to
classify
them
we
can
not
call
them
history
and
they
are
too
truculent
to
pass
for
humor
yet
they
occupy
a
distinct
and
important
place
among
napoleonana
until
william
hazlitt
life
of
bonaparte
appeared
we
had
no
english
treatment
of
bonaparte
that
was
in
any
sense
fair
and
by
the
way
hazlitt
work
is
the
only
one
in
english
i
know
of
which
gives
the
will
of
bonaparte
an
exceedingly
interesting
document
for
a
good
many
years
i
held
the
character
of
napoleon
in
light
esteem
for
the
reason
that
he
had
but
small
regard
for
books
recent
revelations
however
made
to
me
by
grandnephew
of
tom
burke
of
ours
have
served
to
dissipate
that
prejudice
and
i
question
not
that
i
shall
duly
become
as
ardent
a
worshipper
of
the
corsican
as
my
doctor
himself
is
tells
me
and
his
declarations
are
corroborated
by
frederic
masson
and
other
authorities
that
bonaparte
was
a
lover
and
a
collector
of
books
and
that
he
contributed
largely
to
the
dignity
and
the
glorification
of
literature
by
publishing
a
large
number
of
volumes
in
the
highest
style
of
the
art
the
one
department
of
literature
for
which
he
seems
to
have
had
no
liking
was
fiction
novels
of
all
kinds
he
was
in
the
habit
of
tossing
into
the
fire
he
was
a
prodigious
buyer
of
books
and
those
which
he
read
were
invariably
stamped
on
the
outer
cover
with
the
imperial
arms
at
helena
his
library
stamp
was
merely
a
seal
upon
which
ink
was
smeared
napoleon
cared
little
for
fine
bindings
yet
he
knew
their
value
and
whenever
a
presentation
copy
was
to
be
bound
he
required
that
it
be
bound
handsomely
the
books
in
his
own
library
were
invariably
bound
in
calf
of
indifferent
quality
and
he
was
wont
while
reading
a
book
to
fill
the
margin
with
comments
in
pencil
wherever
he
went
he
took
a
library
of
books
with
him
and
these
volumes
he
had
deprived
of
all
superfluous
margin
so
as
to
save
weight
and
space
not
infrequently
when
hampered
by
the
rapid
growth
of
this
travelling
library
he
would
toss
the
overflow
of
books
out
of
his
carriage
window
and
it
was
his
custom
i
shudder
to
record
it
to
separate
the
leaves
of
pamphlets
magazines
and
volumes
by
running
his
finger
between
them
thereby
invariably
tearing
the
pages
in
shocking
wise
in
the
arrangement
of
his
library
napoleon
observed
that
exacting
method
which
was
characteristic
of
him
in
other
employments
and
avocations
each
book
had
its
particular
place
in
a
special
case
and
napoleon
knew
his
library
so
well
that
he
could
at
any
moment
place
his
hand
upon
any
volume
he
desired
the
libraries
at
his
palaces
he
had
arranged
exactly
as
the
library
at
malmaison
was
and
never
was
one
book
borrowed
from
one
to
serve
in
another
it
is
narrated
of
him
that
if
ever
a
volume
was
missing
napoleon
would
describe
its
size
and
the
color
of
its
binding
to
the
librarian
and
would
point
out
the
place
where
it
might
have
been
wrongly
put
and
the
case
where
it
properly
belonged
if
any
one
question
the
greatness
of
this
man
let
him
explain
if
he
can
why
civilization
interest
in
napoleon
increases
as
time
rolls
on
why
is
it
that
we
are
curious
to
know
all
about
him
that
we
have
gratification
in
hearing
tell
of
his
minutest
habits
his
moods
his
whims
his
practices
his
prejudices
why
is
it
that
even
those
who
hated
him
and
who
denied
his
genius
have
felt
called
upon
to
record
in
ponderous
tomes
their
reminiscences
of
him
and
his
deeds
princes
generals
lords
courtiers
poets
painters
priests
plebeians
all
have
vied
with
one
another
in
answering
humanity
demand
for
more
and
more
and
ever
more
about
napoleon
bonaparte
i
think
that
the
supply
will
like
the
demand
never
be
exhausted
the
women
of
the
court
have
supplied
us
with
their
memoirs
so
have
the
diplomats
of
that
period
so
have
the
wives
of
his
generals
so
have
the
spectators
of
those
kaleidoscopic
scenes
so
have
his
keepers
in
exile
so
has
his
barber
the
chambermaids
will
be
heard
from
in
good
time
and
the
hostlers
and
the
scullions
already
there
are
rumors
that
we
are
soon
to
be
regaled
with
memoirs
of
the
emperor
napoleon
by
the
lady
who
knew
the
tailor
who
once
sewed
a
button
on
the
emperor
coat
edited
by
her
loving
grandson
the
duc
de
bunco
without
doubt
many
of
those
who
read
these
lines
will
live
to
see
the
time
when
memoirs
of
napoleon
will
be
offered
by
a
gentleman
who
purchased
a
collection
of
napoleon
spoons
in
doubtless
too
the
book
will
be
hailed
with
satisfaction
for
this
napoleonic
enthusiasm
increases
as
time
wears
on
curious
is
it
not
that
no
calm
judicial
study
of
this
character
and
exploits
is
received
with
favor
he
who
treats
of
the
subject
must
be
either
a
hater
or
an
adorer
of
napoleon
his
blood
must
be
hot
with
the
enthusiasm
of
rage
or
of
love
to
the
human
eye
there
appears
in
space
a
luminous
sphere
that
in
its
appointed
path
goes
on
unceasingly
the
wise
men
are
not
agreed
whether
this
apparition
is
merely
of
gaseous
composition
or
is
a
solid
body
supplied
extraneously
with
heat
and
luminosity
inexhaustibly
some
argue
that
its
existence
will
be
limited
to
the
period
of
one
thousand
or
five
hundred
thousand
or
one
million
years
others
declare
that
it
will
roll
on
until
the
end
of
time
perhaps
the
nature
of
that
luminous
sphere
will
never
be
truly
known
to
mankind
yet
with
calm
dignity
it
moves
in
its
appointed
path
among
the
planets
and
the
stars
of
the
universe
its
fires
unabated
its
luminosity
undimmed
even
so
the
great
corsican
scrutinized
of
all
human
eyes
passes
along
the
aisle
of
time
enveloped
in
the
impenetrable
mystery
of

says
dibdin
ghost
to
me
it
has
never
been
explained
to
my
satisfaction
why
women
as
a
class
are
the
enemies
of
books
and
are
particularly
hostile
to
bibliomania
the
exceptions
met
with
now
and
then
simply
prove
the
rule
judge
methuen
declares
that
bibliophobia
is
but
one
phase
of
jealousy
that
one
wife
hates
one
books
because
she
fears
that
her
husband
is
in
love
or
is
going
to
be
in
love
with
those
companions
of
his
student
hours
if
instead
of
being
folios
quartos
octavos
and
the
like
the
judge
books
were
buxom
blithe
maidens
his
wife
could
hardly
be
more
jealous
of
the
judge
attentions
to
them
than
she
is
under
existing
circumstances
on
one
occasion
having
found
the
judge
on
two
successive
afternoons
sitting
alone
in
the
library
with
pliny
in
his
lap
this
spirited
lady
snatched
the
insidious
volume
from
her
husband
embraces
and
locked
it
up
in
one
of
the
kitchen
pantries
nor
did
she
release
the
object
of
her
displeasure
until
the
judge
had
promised
solemnly
to
be
more
circumspect
in
the
future
and
had
further
mollified
his
wife
anger
by
bringing
home
a
new
silk
dress
and
a
bonnet
of
exceptional
loveliness
other
instances
of
a
similar
character
have
demonstrated
that
methuen
regards
with
implacable
antipathy
the
volumes
upon
which
my
learned
and
ingenious
friend
would
fain
lavish
the
superabundance
of
his
affection
many
years
ago
the
judge
was
compelled
to
resort
to
every
kind
of
artifice
in
order
to
sneak
new
books
into
his
house
and
had
he
not
been
imbued
with
the
true
afflatus
of
bibliomania
he
would
long
ago
have
broken
down
under
the
heartless
tyranny
of
his
vindictive
spouse
when
i
look
around
me
and
survey
the
persecution
to
which
are
subjected
by
their
wives
i
thank
the
goddess
fortune
that
she
has
cast
my
lot
among
the
celibates
indeed
it
is
still
one
of
the
few
serious
questions
i
have
not
yet
solved
viz
whether
a
man
can
at
the
same
time
be
true
to
a
wife
and
to
bibliomania
both
are
exacting
mistresses
and
neither
will
tolerate
a
rival
has
a
theory
that
the
trouble
with
most
wives
is
that
they
are
not
caught
young
enough
he
quotes
johnson
sage
remark
to
the
effect
that
much
can
be
made
of
a
scotchman
if
caught
young
and
he
asserts
that
this
is
equally
true
of
woman
was
a
mere
girl
when
she
wedded
with
the
doctor
and
the
result
of
thirty
experience
and
training
is
that
this
model
woman
sympathizes
with
her
excellent
husband
tastes
and
actually
has
a
feeling
of
contempt
for
other
wives
who
have
never
heard
of
father
prout
and
kit
north
and
who
object
to
their
husbands
smoking
in
bed
i
recall
with
what
enthusiasm
i
once
heard
this
superior
creature
commend
the
doctor
for
having
accepted
in
lieu
of
a
fee
a
set
of
calvin
institutes
with
copious
notes
in
twelve
octavo
volumes
and
a
portfolio
of
colored
prints
my
admiration
for
this
model
wife
could
find
expression
in
no
other
way
i
jumped
from
my
chair
seized
her
in
my
arms
and
imprinted
upon
her
brow
a
fervent
but
respectful
kiss
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
a
prettier
picture
than
that
presented
to
my
vision
as
i
looked
in
from
the
porch
of
the
doctor
residence
upon
the
doctor
family
gathered
together
in
the
library
after
dinner
the
doctor
himself
snuggled
down
in
a
vast
was
dividing
his
attention
between
a
brier
pipe
and
the
odes
of
propertius
his
wife
beside
him
in
her
rocker
smiled
and
smiled
again
over
the
quaint
humor
of
gaskell
cranford
upon
yonder
settee
francis
mahony
methuen
the
oldest
son
was
deep
in
the
perusal
of
wilson
tales
of

his
brother

was
equally
absorbed
in
the
pathetic
tale
of
the
man
without
a

letitia

methuen
the
daughter
was
quietly
sobbing
over
the
tragedy

gleefully
over
an
illustrated
copy
of
that
grand
old
classic
poems
for
infant
minds
by
two
young
persons
for
several
moments
i
stood
spellbound
regarding
with
ineffable
rapture
this
inspiring
spectacle
how
manifold
are
thy
blessings
o
bibliomania
thought
i
and
how
graciously
they
are
distributed
in
this
joyous
circle
wherein
it
is
permitted
to
see
not
only
the
maturer
members
but
alas
the
youth
and
even
the
babes
and
sucklings
drinking
freely
and
gratefully
at
the
of
thy
delights
library
is
one
of
the
most
charming
apartments
i
know
of
it
looks
out
upon
every
variety
of
scenery
for
has
had
constructed
at
considerable
expense
a
light
iron
framework
from
which
are
suspended
at
different
times
cunningly
painted
canvases
representing
landscapes
and
marines
corresponding
to
the
most
whimsical
fancy
in
the
dead
of
winter
the
doctor
often
has
a
desire
to
look
out
upon
a
cheery
landscape
thereupon
by
a
simple
manipulation
of
a
keyboard
there
is
unrolled
a
panorama
of
velvety
hillsides
and
flowery
meads
of
grazing
sheep
and
of
piping
rustics
so
natural
is
the
spectacle
that
one
can
almost
hear
the
music
of
the
reeds
and
fancy
himself
in
arcadia
if
in
midsummer
the
heat
is
oppressive
and
life
seems
burthensome
forthwith
another
canvas
is
outspread
and
the
glories
of
the
alps
appear
or
a
stretch
of
blue
sea
or
a
corner
of
a
primeval
forest
so
there
is
an
outlook
for
every
mood
and
i
doubt
not
that
this
ingenious
provision
contributes
potently
towards
promoting
bibliomaniac
harmony
and
prosperity
in
my
friend
household
it
is
true
that
i
myself
am
not
susceptible
to
external
influences
when
once
i
am
surrounded
by
books
i
do
not
care
a
fig
whether
my
library
overlooks
a
garden
or
a
desert
give
me
my
dear
companions
in
their
dress
of
leather
cloth
or
boards
and
it
matters
not
to
me
whether
god
sends
storm
or
sunshine
flowers
or
hail
light
or
darkness
noise
or
calm
yet
i
know
and
admit
that
environment
means
much
to
most
people
and
i
do
most
heartily
applaud
versatile
device
i
have
always
thought
that
de
quincey
workshop
would
have
given
me
great
delight
the
particular
thing
that
excited
de
quincey
choler
was
interference
with
his
books
and
manuscripts
which
he
piled
atop
of
one
another
upon
the
floor
and
over
his
desk
until
at
last
there
would
be
but
a
narrow
little
pathway
from
the
desk
to
the
fireplace
and
from
the
fireplace
to
the
door
and
his
gracious
what
a
pelion
upon
ossa
of
confusion
it
must
have
been
yet
de
quincey
insisted
that
he
knew
just
where
everything
was
and
he
merely
exacted
that
the
servants
attempt
no
such
vandalism
as
cleaning
up
in
his
workshop
of
course
there
would
presently
come
a
time
when
there
was
no
more
room
on
the
table
and
when
the
little
pathway
to
the
fireplace
and
the
door
would
be
no
longer
visible
then
with
a
sigh
de
quincey
would
lock
the
door
of
that
room
and
betake
himself
to
other
quarters
which
in
turn
would
eventually
become
quite
as
littered
up
cluttered
up
and
impassable
as
the
first
rooms
from
all
that
can
be
gathered
upon
the
subject
it
would
appear
that
de
quincey
was
careless
in
his
treatment
of
books
i
have
read
somewhere
but
i
forget
where
that
he
used
his
forefinger
as
a
and
that
he
did
not
hesitate
to
mutilate
old
folios
which
he
borrowed
but
he
was
extraordinarily
tender
with
his
manuscripts
and
he
was
wont
to
carry
in
his
pockets
a
soft
brush
with
which
he
used
to
dust
off
his
manuscripts
most
carefully
before
handing
them
to
the
publisher
sir
walter
scott
was
similarly
careful
with
his
books
and
he
used
for
purposes
of
dusting
them
the
end
of
a
fox
tail
set
in
a
handle
of
silver
scott
was
however
particular
and
systematic
in
the
arrangement
of
his
books
and
his
with
its
choice
and
its
interesting
collection
of
pictures
and
framed
letters
was
a
veritable
paradise
to
the
visiting
and
he
was
as
fond
of
early
rising
as
francis
jeffrey
was
averse
to
it
and
both
these
eminent
men
were
strongly
attached
to
animal
pets
jeffrey
particularly
affected
an
aged
and
garrulous
parrot
and
an
equally
disreputable
little
dog
scott
was
so
stanch
a
friend
of
dogs
that
wherever
he
went
he
was
accompanied
by
one
or
two
sometimes
by
a
whole
kennel
of
these
faithful
brutes
in
gordon
noble
memoirs
we
have
a
vivid
picture
of
professor
wilson
workroom
all
was
confusion
there
his
room
was
a
strange
mixture
of
what
may
be
called
order
and
untidiness
for
there
was
not
a
scrap
of
paper
or
a
book
that
his
hand
could
not
light
upon
in
a
moment
while
to
the
casual
eye
in
search
of
discovery
it
would
appear
chaos
wilson
had
no
love
for
fine
furniture
and
he
seems
to
have
crowded
his
books
together
without
regard
to
any
system
of
classification
he
had
a
habit
of
mixing
his
books
around
with
and
his
charming
biographer
tells
us
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
to
find
the
wealth
of

attic
upon
the
walls
of

he
and
his
sister
pasted
old

gay

this
resulted
in
giving
the

a
cheery
aspect

old

evades

he

his

thomas
westwood
tells

that
there
were

in

throw
away

wordsworth
on
the
other
hand
cared
little
for
books
his
library
was
a
small
one
embracing
hardly
more
than
five
hundred
volumes
he
drew
his
inspiration
not
from
books
but
from
nature
from
all
that
i
have
heard
of
him
i
judge
him
to
have
been
a
very
dull
man
allibone
relates
of
him
that
he
once
remarked
that
he
did
not
consider
himself
a
witty
poet
indeed
quoth
he
i
do
think
i
ever
was
witty
but
once
in
my
life
his
friends
urged
him
to
tell
them
about
it
after
some
hesitation
he
said
well
i
will
tell
you
i
was
standing
some
time
ago
at
the
entrance
of
rydal
mount
a
man
accosted
me
with
the
question
sir
have
you
seen
my
wife
pass
by
whereupon
i
retorted
my
good
friend
i
did
know
till
this
moment
that
you
had
a
wife
illustrative
of
wordsworth
vanity
it
is
told
that
when
it
was
reported
that
the
next
waverley
novel
was
to
be
rob
roy
the
poet
took
down
his
ballads
and
read
to
the
company
rob
roy
grave
then
he
said
gravely
i
do
not
know
what
more
scott
can
have
to
say
on
the
subject
wordsworth
and
dickens
disliked
each
other
cordially
having
been
asked
his
opinion
of
the
young
novelist
wordsworth
answered
why
i
not
much
given
to
turn
critic
on
people
i
meet
but
as
you
ask
me
i
will
cordially
avow
that
i
thought
him
a
very
talkative
young
person
but
i
dare
say
he
may
be
very
clever
mind
i
do
want
to
say
a
word
against
him
for
i
have
never
read
a
line
he
has
written
the
same
inquirer
subsequently
asked
dickens
how
he
liked
wordsworth
like
him
roared
dickens
not
at
all
he
is
a
dreadful
old
ass

our
debt
to
monkish
men
where
one
has
the
time
and
the
money
to
devote
to
the
collection
of
missals
and
illuminated
books
the
avocation
must
be
a
very
delightful
one
i
never
look
upon
a
missal
or
upon
a
bit
of
antique
illumination
that
i
do
not
invest
that
object
with
a
certain
poetic
romance
and
i
picture
to
myself
long
lines
of
monkish
men
bending
over
their
tasks
and
applying
themselves
with
pious
enthusiasm
thereto
we
should
not
flatter
ourselves
that
the
enjoyment
of
the
delights
of
bibliomania
was
reserved
to
one
time
and
generation
a
greater
than
any
of
us
lived
many
centuries
ago
and
went
his
bibliomaniacal
way
gathering
together
treasures
from
every
quarter
and
diffusing
every
where
a
veneration
and
love
for
books
richard
de
bury
was
the
king
if
not
the
father
of
bibliomaniacs
his
immortal
work
reveals
to
us
that
long
before
the
invention
of
printing
men
were
tormented
and
enraptured
by
those
very
same
desires
envies
jealousies
greeds
enthusiasms
and
passions
which
possess
and
control
bibliomaniacs
at
the
present
time
that
vanity
was
sometimes
the
controlling
passion
with
the
early
collectors
is
evidenced
in
a
passage
in
barclay
satire
the
ship
of
fools
there
are
the
stanzas
which
apply
so
neatly
to
certain
people
i
know
that
sometimes
i
actually
suspect
that
barclay
prophetic
eye
must
have
had
these
charlatans
in
view
but
yet
i
have
them
in
great
reverence
and
honor
saving
them
from
filth
and
ordure
by
often
brushing
and
much
diligence
full
goodly
bound
in
pleasant
coverture
of
damask
satin
or
else
of
velvet
pure
i
keep
them
sure
fearing
lest
they
should
be
lost
for
in
them
is
the
cunning
wherein
i
me
boast
but
if
it
fortune
that
any
learned
man
within
my
house
fall
to
disputation
i
draw
the
curtains
to
show
my
books
them
that
they
of
my
cunning
should
make
probation
i
love
not
to
fall
into
altercation
and
while
they
come
my
books
i
turn
and
wind
for
all
is
in
them
and
nothing
in
my
mind
richard
de
bury
had
exceptional
opportunities
for
gratifying
his
bibliomaniac
passions
he
was
chancellor
and
treasurer
of
edward
and
his
official
position
gained
him
access
to
public
and
private
libraries
and
to
the
society
of
literary
men
moreover
when
it
became
known
that
he
was
fond
of
such
things
people
from
every
quarter
sent
him
and
brought
him
old
books
it
may
be
that
they
hoped
in
this
wise
to
court
his
official
favor
or
perhaps
they
were
prompted
by
the
less
selfish
motive
of
gladdening
the
bibliomaniac
soul
the
flying
fame
of
our
love
says
de
bury
had
already
spread
in
all
directions
and
it
was
reported
not
only
that
we
had
a
longing
desire
for
books
and
especially
for
old
ones
but
that
any
one
could
more
easily
obtain
our
favors
by
quartos
than
by
money
wherefore
when
supported
by
the
bounty
of
the
aforesaid
prince
of
worthy
memory
we
were
enabled
to
oppose
or
advance
to
appoint
or
to
discharge
crazy
quartos
and
tottering
folios
precious
however
in
our
sight
as
in
our
affections
flowed
in
most
rapidly
from
the
great
and
the
small
instead
of
new
year
gifts
and
remunerations
and
instead
of
presents
and
jewels
then
the
cabinets
of
the
most
noble
monasteries
were
opened
cases
were
unlocked
caskets
were
unclasped
and
sleeping
volumes
which
had
slumbered
for
long
ages
in
their
sepulchres
were
roused
up
and
those
that
lay
hid
in
dark
places
were
overwhelmed
with
the
rays
of
a
new
light
among
these
as
time
served
we
sat
down
more
voluptuously
than
the
delicate
physician
could
do
amidst
his
stores
of
aromatics
and
where
we
found
an
object
of
love
we
found
also
an
assuagement
if
says
de
bury
we
would
have
amassed
cups
of
gold
and
silver
excellent
horses
or
no
mean
sums
of
money
we
could
in
those
days
have
laid
up
abundance
of
wealth
for
ourselves
but
we
regarded
books
not
pounds
and
valued
codices
more
than
florins
and
preferred
paltry
pamphlets
to
pampered
palfreys
on
tedious
embassies
and
in
perilous
times
we
carried
about
with
us
that
fondness
for
books
which
many
waters
could
not
extinguish
and
what
books
they
were
in
those
old
days
what
tall
folios
what
stout
quartos
how
magnificent
were
the
bindings
wrought
often
in
silver
devices
sometimes
in
gold
and
not
infrequently
in
silver
and
gold
with
splendid
jewels
and
precious
stones
to
add
their
value
to
that
of
the
precious
volume
which
they
adorned
the
works
of
justin
seneca
martial
terence
and
claudian
were
highly
popular
with
the
bibliophiles
of
early
times
and
the
writings
of
ovid
tully
horace
cato
aristotle
sallust
hippocrates
macrobius
augustine
bede
gregory
origen
etc
but
for
the
veneration
and
love
for
books
which
the
monks
of
the
mediaeval
ages
had
what
would
have
been
preserved
to
us
of
the
classics
of
the
greeks
and
the
romans
the
same
auspicious
fate
that
prompted
those
bibliomaniacal
monks
to
hide
away
manuscript
treasures
in
the
cellars
of
their
monasteries
inspired
poggio
bracciolini
several
centuries
later
to
hunt
out
and
invade
those
sacred
and
these
quests
were
rewarded
with
finds
whose
value
can
not
be
overestimated
all
that
we
have
of
the
histories
of
livy
come
to
us
through
poggio
industry
as
a
this
same
worthy
found
and
brought
away
from
different
monasteries
a
perfect
copy
of
quintilian
a
cicero
oration
for
caecina
a
complete
tertullian
a
petronius
arbiter
and
fifteen
or
twenty
other
classics
almost
as
valuable
as
those
i
have
named
from
german
monasteries
poggio
friend
nicolas
of
treves
brought
away
twelve
comedies
of
plautus
and
a
fragment
of
aulus
gellius
dear
as
their
pagan
books
were
to
the
monkish
collectors
it
was
upon
their
bibles
their
psalters
and
their
other
religious
books
that
these
mediaeval
bibliomaniacs
expended
their
choicest
art
and
their
most
loving
care
cuthbert
gospels
preserved
in
the
british
museum
was
written
by
egfrith
a
monk
circa
aethelwald
bound
the
book
in
gold
and
precious
stones
and
bilfrid
a
hermit
illuminated
it
by
prefixing
to
each
gospel
a
beautiful
painting
representing
one
of
the
evangelists
and
a
tessellated
cross
executed
in
a
most
elaborate
manner
bilfrid
also
illuminated
the
large
capital
letters
at
the
beginning
of
the
gospels
this
precious
volume
was
still
further
enriched
by
aldred
of
durham
who
interlined
it
with
a
saxon
gloss
or
version
of
the
latin
text
of
jerome
of
the
exact
pecuniary
value
of
books
during
the
middle
ages
says
merryweather
we
have
no
means
of
judging
the
few
instances
that
have
accidentally
been
recorded
are
totally
inadequate
to
enable
us
to
form
an
opinion
the
extravagant
estimate
given
by
some
as
to
the
value
of
books
in
those
days
is
merely
conjectural
as
it
necessarily
must
be
when
we
remember
that
the
price
was
guided
by
the
accuracy
of
the
transcription
the
splendor
of
the
binding
which
was
often
gorgeous
to
excess
and
by
the
beauty
and
richness
of
the
illuminations
many
of
the
manuscripts
of
the
middle
ages
are
magnificent
in
the
extreme
sometimes
inscribed
in
liquid
gold
on
parchment
of
the
richest
purple
and
adorned
with
illuminations
of
exquisite
workmanship
with
such
a
veneration
and
love
for
books
obtaining
in
the
cloister
and
at
the
fireside
what
pathos
is
revealed
to
us
in
the
supplication
which
invited
god
blessing
upon
the
beloved
tomes
o
lord
send
the
virtue
of
thy
holy
spirit
upon
these
our
books
that
cleansing
them
from
all
earthly
things
by
thy
holy
blessing
they
may
mercifully
enlighten
our
hearts
and
give
us
true
understanding
and
grant
that
by
thy
teachings
they
may
brightly
preserve
and
make
full
an
abundance
of
good
works
according
to
thy
will
and
what
inspiration
and
cheer
does
every
find
in
the
letter
which
that
grand
old
bibliomaniac
alcuin
addressed
to
charlemagne
i
your
flaccus
according
to
your
admonitions
and
good
will
administer
to
some
in
the
house
of
martin
the
sweets
of
the
holy
scriptures
others
i
inebriate
with
the
study
of
ancient
wisdom
and
others
i
fill
with
the
fruits
of
grammatical
lore
many
i
seek
to
instruct
in
the
order
of
the
stars
which
illuminate
the
glorious
vault
of
heaven
so
that
they
may
be
made
ornaments
to
the
holy
church
of
god
and
the
court
of
your
imperial
majesty
that
the
goodness
of
god
and
your
kindness
may
not
be
altogether
unproductive
of
good
but
in
doing
this
i
discover
the
want
of
much
especially
those
exquisite
books
of
scholastic
learning
which
i
possessed
in
my
own
country
through
the
industry
of
my
good
and
most
devout
master
egbert
i
therefore
entreat
your
excellence
to
permit
me
to
send
into
britain
some
of
our
youths
to
procure
those
books
which
we
so
much
desire
and
thus
transplant
into
france
the
flowers
of
britain
that
they
may
fructify
and
perfume
not
only
the
garden
at
york
but
also
the
paradise
of
tours
and
that
we
may
say
in
the
words
of
the
song
my
beloved
come
into
his
garden
and
eat
his
pleasant
fruit
and
to
the
young
o
friends
drink
yea
drink
abundantly
o
beloved
or
exhort
in
the
words
of
the
prophet
isaiah
one
that
thirsteth
to
come
to
the
waters
and
ye
that
have
no
money
come
ye
buy
and
eat
yea
come
buy
wine
and
milk
without
money
and
without
price
i
was
meaning
to
have
somewhat
to
say
about
alcuin
and
had
intended
to
pay
my
respects
to
canute
alfred
the
abbot
of
albans
the
archbishop
of
salzburg
the
prior
of
dover
and
other
mediaeval
worthies
when
judge
methuen
came
in
and
interrupted
the
thread
of
my
meditation
the
judge
brings
me
some
verses
done
recently
by
a
of
his
and
he
asks
me
to
give
them
a
place
in
these
memoirs
as
illustrating
the
vanity
of
human
confidence
one
day
i
got
a
missive
writ
in
a
dainty
hand
which
made
my
manly
bosom
with
vanity
expand
was
from
a
young
admirer
who
asked
me
would
i
mind
sending
her
favorite
poem
in
autograph
and
signed
she
craved
the
boon
so
sweetly
that
i
had
been
a
churl
had
i
repulsed
the
homage
of
this
gentle
timid
girl
with
bright
illuminations
i
decked
the
manuscript
and
in
my
choicest
paints
and
inks
my
brush
and
pen
i
dipt
indeed
it
had
been
tedious
but
that
a
flattered
smile
played
on
my
rugged
features
and
eased
my
toil
the
while
i
was
assured
my
poem
would
fill
her
with
delight
i
fancied
she
was
pretty
i
knew
that
she
was
bright
and
for
a
spell
thereafter
that
unknown
damsel
face
with
its
worshipful
expression
pursued
me
every
place
meseemed
to
hear
her
whisper
o
thank
you
gifted
sir
for
the
overwhelming
honor
you
so
graciously
confer
but
a
catalogue
from
disproves
what
things
meseemed
dispels
with
savage
certainty
the
flattering
dreams
i
dreamed
for
that
poor
favorite
poem
done
and
signed
in
autograph
is
listed
in
cheap
items
at
a
