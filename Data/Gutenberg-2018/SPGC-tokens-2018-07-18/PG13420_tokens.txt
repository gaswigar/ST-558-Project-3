travel
in
china
is
easy
to
walk
across
china
over
roads
acknowledgedly
worse
than
are
met
with
in
any
civilized
country
in
the
two
hemispheres
and
having
accommodation
unequalled
for
crudeness
and
insanitation
is
not
easy
in
deciding
to
travel
in
china
i
determined
to
cross
overland
from
the
head
of
the
yangtze
gorges
to
british
burma
on
foot
and
although
the
strain
nearly
cost
me
my
life
no
conveyance
was
used
in
any
part
of
my
journey
other
than
at
two
points
described
in
the
course
of
the
narrative
for
several
days
during
my
travels
i
lay
at
the
point
of
death
the
arduousness
of
constant
such
is
ordinary
travel
in
most
parts
of
western
the
foundation
of
a
long
illness
rendering
it
impossible
for
me
to
continue
my
walking
and
as
a
consequence
i
resided
in
the
interior
of
china
during
a
period
of
convalescence
of
several
months
duration
at
the
end
of
which
i
continued
my
tramp
subsequently
i
returned
into
from
burma
lived
again
in
and
and
traveled
in
the
wilds
of
the
surrounding
country
whilst
traveling
i
lived
on
chinese
food
and
in
the
miao
country
where
rice
could
not
be
got
subsisted
for
many
days
on
maize
only
my
sole
object
in
going
to
china
was
a
personal
desire
to
see
china
from
the
inside
my
trip
was
undertaken
for
no
other
purpose
i
carried
no
instruments
with
the
exception
of
an
aneroid
and
did
not
even
make
a
single
survey
of
the
untrodden
country
through
which
i
occasionally
passed
so
far
as
i
know
i
am
the
only
traveler
apart
from
members
of
the
missionary
community
who
has
ever
resided
far
away
in
the
interior
of
the
celestial
empire
for
so
long
a
time
most
of
the
manuscript
for
this
book
was
written
as
i
went
along
a
good
deal
of
it
actually
by
the
roadside
in
rural
china
when
my
journey
was
completed
the
following
news
paragraph
in
the
north
china
daily
news
of
shanghai
was
brought
to
my
notice
all
the
legations
at
peking
have
received
anonymous
letters
from
alleged
revolutionaries
in
shanghai
containing
the
warning
that
an
extensive
uprising
is
imminent
if
they
do
not
assist
the
manchus
foreigners
will
not
be
harmed
otherwise
they
will
be
destroyed
in
a
general
massacre
the
missives
were
delivered
mysteriously
bearing
obliterated
postmarks
in
view
of
the
recent
similar
warnings
received
by
the
consuls
uneasiness
has
been
created
the
above
appeared
in
the
journal
quoted
on
june
the
reader
in
perusing
my
previously
written
remarks
on
the
spirit
of
reform
and
how
far
it
has
penetrated
into
the
innermost
corners
of
the
empire
should
bear
this
paragraph
in
mind
for
there
is
more
boxerism
and
unrest
in
china
than
we
know
of
my
account
of
the
hankow
riots
of
january
through
which
i
myself
went
will
with
my
experience
of
rebellions
in
justify
my
assertion
i
should
like
to
thank
all
those
missionaries
who
entertained
me
as
i
proceeded
through
china
especially
john
graham
and
fleischmann
of
the
china
inland
mission
who
transacted
a
good
deal
of
business
for
me
and
took
all
trouble
uncomplainingly
i
am
also
indebted
to
clark
of
and
to
the
revs
parsons
and
pollard
for
several
photographs
illustrating
that
section
of
this
book
dealing
with
the
tribes
of
i
wish
to
express
my
acknowledgments
to
several
writers
on
far
eastern
topics
notably
to
morrison
of
peking
the
rev
sidney
hulick
and
morse
whose
works
are
quoted
much
information
was
also
gleaned
from
other
sources
my
thanks
are
due
also
to
brayton
slater
and
to
my
brother
dingle
for
their
kindness
in
having
negotiated
with
my
publishers
in
my
absence
in
inland
china
and
to
the
latter
for
unfailing
courtesy
and
patience
i
am
under
considerable
obligation
across
china
on
foot
would
have
appeared
in
the
autumn
of
had
the
printers
proofs
which
were
several
times
sent
to
me
to
different
addresses
in
china
but
which
dodged

repeatedly

to
introductory
i
am
walking
across
interior
of
life
and
travel
in
china
for
the
chinese
new
china
and
the
determination
of
the
voice
of
the
province
of
and
the
forward
of
of
french
and
english
sail
up
the
population
of
in

through
china
from
end
to

from
shanghai
miles
by
river
and
miles
walking
overland
from
the
greatest
port
of
the
chinese
empire
to
the
frontier
of
british
burma
that
is
my
scheme
i
am
a
journalist
one
of
the
army
of
the
who
go
down
early
to
the
valley
i
state
this
because
i
would
that
the
truth
be
told
for
whilst
engaged
in
the
project
with
which
this
book
has
mainly
to
deal
i
was
subjected
to
peculiar
designations
such
as
explorer
and
other
newspaper
extravagances
and
it
were
well
perhaps
for
my
reader
to
know
once
for
all
that
the
writer
is
merely
a
newspaper
man
at
the
time
on
holiday
the
rather
extreme
idea
of
walking
across
this
flowery
land
came
to
me
early
in
the
year
although
for
many
years
i
had
cherished
the
hope
of
seeing
interior
china
ere
modernity
had
robbed
her
and
her
wonderful
people
of
their
isolation
and
antediluvianism
and
ever
since
childhood
my
interest
in
china
has
always
been
considerable
a
little
prior
to
the
chinese
new
year
a
friend
of
mine
dined
with
me
at
my
rooms
in
singapore
in
the
straits
settlements
and
the
conversation
about
china
resulted
in
our
decision
then
and
there
to
travel
through
the
empire
on
holiday
he
because
at
the
time
he
had
little
else
to
do
the
author
because
he
thought
that
a
few
months
travel
in
would
from
a
journalistic
standpoint
be
passed
profitably
the
intention
being
to
arrive
home
in
dear
old
england
late
in
the
summer
of
the
same
year
we
agreed
to
cross
china
on
foot
and
accordingly
on
february
just
as
the
sun
was
sinking
over
the
beautiful
harbor
of
singapore
that
most
valuable
strategic
gate
of
the
far
east
where
crown
colonial
administration
however
is
allowed
by
a
lethargic
british
government
to
become
more
and
more
bungled
every
year
we
settled
down
on
board
the
french
mail
steamer
bound
for
shanghai
my
friends
good
fellows
in
reluctantly
speeding
me
on
my
way
prophesied
that
this
would
prove
to
be
my
last
long
voyage
to
a
last
long
rest
that
the
chinese
would
never
allow
me
to
come
out
of
china
alive
such
is
the
ignorance
of
the
average
man
concerning
the
conditions
of
life
and
travel
in
the
interior
of
this
land
of
night
here
then
was
i
on
my
way
to
that
land
towards
which
all
the
world
was
straining
its
eyes
whose
nation
above
all
nations
of
the
earth
was
altering
for
better
things
and
coming
out
of
its
historic
shell
reform
reform
reform
was
the
echo
and
i
myself
was
on
the
way
to
hear
it
at
the
time
i
started
for
china
the
cry
of
china
for
the
chinese
was
heard
in
all
countries
among
all
peoples
statesmen
were
startled
by
it
editors
wrote
the
phrase
to
death
magazines
were
filled
with
copy
good
bad
and
indifferent
mostly
written
be
it
said
by
men
whose
knowledge
of
the
question
was
by
no
means
complete
editorial
opinion
and
contradiction
of
that
opinion
were
printed
side
by
side
in
journals
having
a
good
name
to
one
who
endeavored
actually
to
understand
what
was
being
done
and
whither
these
broad
tendencies
and
strange
cravings
of
the
chinese
were
leading
a
people
who
formerly
were
so
indifferent
to
progress
it
seemed
essential
that
he
should
go
to
the
country
and
there
on
the
spot
make
a
study
of
the
problem
was
the
reform
if
genuine
at
all
universal
in
china
did
it
reach
to
the
ends
of
the
empire
that
a
new
china
had
come
into
being
and
was
working
astounding
results
in
the
enlightened
provinces
above
the
yangtze
and
those
connected
with
the
capital
by
railway
was
common
knowledge
but
one
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
the
west
and
the
of
the
empire
were
moved
by
the
same
spirit
of
europeanism
and
it
will
be
seen
that
china
in
the
west
moves
if
at
all
but
at
a
snail
pace
the
second
part
of
this
volume
deals
with
that
portion
of
the
subject
and
it
may
be
that
the
new
china
as
we
know
it
in
the
more
forward
spheres
of
activity
will
only
take
her
proper
place
in
the
family
of
nations
after
fresh
upheavals
rivers
of
blood
may
yet
have
to
flow
as
a
sickening
libation
to
the
gods
who
have
guided
the
nation
for
forty
centuries
before
she
will
be
able
to
attain
her
ambition
of
standing
line
to
line
with
the
other
powers
of
the
eastern
and
western
worlds
but
it
seems
that
no
matter
what
the
cost
no
matter
what
she
may
have
to
suffer
financially
and
nationally
no
matter
how
great
the
obstinacy
of
the
people
towards
the
reform
movement
the
change
is
coming
has
already
come
with
alarming
rapidity
and
has
come
to
stay
china
is
changing
let
so
much
be
granted
and
although
the
movement
may
be
hampered
by
a
thousand
general
difficulties
presented
by
the
ancient
civilization
of
a
people
whose
customs
and
manners
and
ideas
have
stood
the
test
of
time
since
the
days
contemporary
with
those
of
solomon
and
at
one
time
bade
fair
to
test
eternity
the
government
cry
of
china
for
the
chinese
is
going
to
win
chinese
civilization
has
for
ages
been
allowed
to
get
into
a
very
bad
state
of
repair
and
official
corruption
and
deceit
have
prevented
the
government
from
making
an
effectual
move
towards
aims
but
that
she
is
now
making
an
honest
endeavor
to
rectify
her
faults
in
the
face
of
tremendous
odds
must
so
it
appears
to
the
writer
be
apparent
to
all
beholders
that
is
the
government
it
is
important
to
note
this
in
china
however
the
government
is
not
the
people
it
never
has
been
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
great
political
and
social
reforms
can
be
introduced
into
such
an
enormous
country
as
china
and
among
her
four
hundred
and
thirty
millions
of
people
merely
by
the
issue
of
a
few
imperial
edicts
the
masses
have
to
be
convinced
that
any
given
thing
is
for
the
public
good
before
they
accept
despite
the
proclamations
and
in
thus
convincing
her
own
people
china
has
yet
to
go
through
the
fire
of
a
terrible
ordeal
especially
will
this
be
seen
in
the
second
part
of
this
volume
where
in
there
are
huge
areas
absolutely
untouched
by
the
forward
movement
and
where
the
people
are
living
the
same
life
of
disease
distress
and
dirt
of
official
social
and
moral
degradation
as
they
lived
when
the
westerner
remained
still
in
the
primeval
forest
stage
but
despite
the
scepticism
and
the
cynicism
of
certain
writers
whose
pessimism
is
due
to
a
lack
of
foresight
and
despite
the
fact
that
she
is
being
constantly
accused
of
having
in
the
past
ignominiously
failed
at
the
crucial
moment
in
endeavors
towards
minor
reforms
i
am
one
of
those
who
believe
that
in
china
we
shall
see
arising
a
government
whose
power
will
be
paramount
in
the
east
and
upon
the
integrity
of
whose
people
will
depend
the
peace
of
europe
it
is
much
to
say
we
shall
not
see
it
but
our
children
will
the
government
is
going
to
conquer
the
people
she
has
done
so
already
in
certain
provinces
and
in
a
few
years
the
reform
deep
and
real
not
the
we
see
in
many
parts
of
the
empire
will
be
universal
between
singapore
and
shanghai
the
opportunity
occurred
of
calling
at
saigon
and
two
cities
offering
instructive
contrasts
of
french
and
british
administration
in
the
far
east
saigon
is
not
troubled
much
by
the
britisher
the
frenchman
has
brought
it
to
represent
fairly
his
loved
paris
in
the
east
the
approach
to
the
city
through
the
dirty
brown
mud
of
the
treacherous
mekong
which
is
swept
down
vigorously
to
the
china
sea
between
stretches
of
monotonous
mangrove
with
no
habitation
of
man
anywhere
visible
is
distinctly
unpicturesque
but
saigon
itself
apart
from
the
exorbitance
of
the
charges
especially
so
to
the
spendthrift
englishman
is
worth
the
dreary
journey
of
numberless
twists
and
quick
turns
annoying
to
the
most
patient
pilot
in
the
daytime
saigon
is
as
hot
as
that
last
bourne
whither
all
wander
englishmen
and
dogs
alone
are
seen
abroad
between
nine
and
one
but
in
the
soothing
cool
of
the
soft
tropical
evening
boulevards
a
magnificent
alfresco
cafés
where
dawdle
the
absinthe
drinkers
the
gendarmes
and
innumerable
features
typically
and
picturesquely
french
induced
me
easily
to
believe
myself
back
in
the
bewildering
whirl
of
the
boulevard
des
capucines
or
des
italiennes
whether
the
narrow
streets
of
the
native
city
are
clean
or
dirty
whether
garbage
heaps
lie
festering
in
the
broiling
sun
sending
their
disgusting
effluvia
out
to
annoy
the
sense
of
smell
at
every
turn
the
municipality
cares
not
a
little
bit
indifference
to
the
of
the
native
pervades
it
there
is
present
no
progressive
prosperity
every
second
person
i
met
was
or
seemed
to
be
a
government
official
he
was
dressed
in
immaculate
white
clothes
of
the
typical
ugly
french
cut
trimmed
elaborately
with
an
decoration
of
gold
braid
and
brass
buttons
all
was
so
different
from
singapore
and
and
one
did
not
feel
in
surroundings
which
made
strongly
for
the
of
the
frenchman
in
the
east
ashamed
of
the
fact
that
he
was
an
englishman
three
days
north
lies
an
link
in
the
armed
chain
of
britain
empire
east
of
suez
bone
of
the
bone
and
flesh
of
the
flesh
of
great
britain
beyond
the
seas
the
history
of
this
island
ceded
to
us
in
by
the
treaty
of
nanking
is
known
to
everyone
in
europe
or
should
be
four
and
a
half
days
more
and
we
anchored
at
and
a
few
hours
later
after
a
terribly
cold
run
up
the
river
in
the
teeth
of
a
terrific
wind
we
arrived
at
shanghai
the
average
man
in
europe
and
america
does
not
know
that
this
great
metropolis
of
the
far
east
is
far
removed
from
salt
water
and
that
it
is
the
first
point
on
entering
the
at
which
a
port
could
be
established
it
is
twelve
miles
up
the
junks
whirled
past
with
curious
tattered
brown
sails
resembling
dilapidated
verandah
blinds
merchantmen
were
there
flying
the
flags
of
the
nations
of
the
world
all
churning
up
the
yellow
stream
as
they
hurried
to
catch
the
at
the
bar
then
came
the
din
of
disembarkation
enthusiastic
coolies
rickshaw
men
professional
chinese
beggars
and
the
inevitable
of
a
large
eastern
city
crowded
around
me
to
turn
an
honest
or
dishonest
penny
some
rude
lout
covered
with
grease
and
pushed
bang
against
me
and
hurled
me
without
ceremony
from
his
path
my
baggage
meantime
was
thrown
onto
a
van
drawn
by
four
of
those
poor
human
beasts
of
burden
how
horrible
to
have
been
born
a
chinese
coolie
and
i
was
whirled
away
to
my
hotel
for
tucker
the
french
mail
had
given
us
coffee
and
rolls
at
six
but
the
excitement
of
landing
at
a
foreign
port
does
not
usually
produce
the
net
amount
of
satisfaction
to
or
make
for
the
sustenance
of
the
inner
man
of
the
phlegmatic
englishman
as
with
the
frenchman
therefore
were
our
spirits
ruffled
however
my
companion
and
i
fed
later
subsequently
to
this
we
agreed
not
to
be
drawn
to
the
clubs
or
mix
in
the
social
life
of
shanghai
but
to
consider
ourselves
as
two
beings
entirely
apart
from
the
sixteen
thousand
and
britishers
americans
frenchmen
germans
russians
danes
portuguese
and
other
sundry
internationals
at
that
moment
at
shanghai
they
lived
there
we
were
soon
to
leave
the
city
was
suffering
from
the
abnormal
congestion
common
to
the
orient
with
a
big
dash
of
the
west
trams
motors
rickshaws
the
peculiar
chinese
wheelbarrow
horrid
public
shaky
landaus
in
miniature
conveyances
of
all
kinds
and
the
swarming
masses
of
coolie
humanity
carrying
or
hauling
merchandise
amid
incessant
jabbering
yelling
and
vociferating
made
intense
bewilderment

of

points
of

future
of
our

of

let
no
one
who
has
been
so
far
as
ichang
a
thousand
miles
from
the
sea
imagine
that
he
has
been
into
the
interior
of
china
it
is
quite
an
everyday
trip
modern
steamers
with
every
modern
convenience
and
luxury
probably
as
comfortable
as
any
river
steamers
in
the
world
ply
regularly
in
their
two
services
between
shanghai
and
this
port
at
the
foot
of
the
gorges
the
looked
like
the
thames
and
the
shanghai
bund
like
the
embankment
when
i
embarked
on
board
a
jap
boat
for
hankow
and
thence
to
ichang
by
a
smaller
steamer
on
a
dark
bitterly
cold
saturday
night
march
i
was
to
travel
fifteen
hundred
miles
up
that
greatest
artery
of
china
the
yangtze
surpasses
in
importance
to
the
celestial
empire
what
the
mississippi
is
to
america
and
yet
even
in
china
there
are
thousands
of
resident
foreigners
who
know
no
more
about
this
great
river
than
the
average
smithfield
butcher
ask
ten
men
in
fleet
street
or
in
wall
street
where
ichang
is
and
nine
will
be
unable
to
tell
you
yet
it
is
a
port
of
great
importance
when
one
considers
that
the
handling
of
china
vast
trade
has
been
opened
to
foreign
trade
and
residence
since
the
chefoo
convention
was
signed
in
that
ichang
is
a
city
of
forty
thousand
souls
and
has
a
gross
total
of
imports
of
nearly
forty
millions
of
taels
of
hankow
however
more
is
known
here
we
landed
after
a
four
run
and
owing
to
the
low
water
had
to
wait
five
days
before
the
steamer
for
the
higher
journey
had
come
in
the
city
is
made
up
of
foreign
concessions
as
in
other
treaty
ports
but
away
in
the
native
quarter
there
is
the
real
china
with
her
selfish
rush
her
squalidness
and
filth
among
the
teeming
thousands
there
dwell
together
literally
side
by
side
but
yet
eternally
apart
all
the
conflicting
elements
of
the
east
and
west
which
go
to
make
up
a
city
in
the
far
east
and
particularly
the
china
coast
hankow
means
literally
han
mouth
being
situated
at
the
juncture
of
the
han
river
and
the
yangtze
across
the
way
as
i
write
i
can
see
with
its
iron
works
belching
out
black
curls
of
smoke
where
the
arsenal
turns
out
one
hundred
mauser
rifles
daily
this
is
but
a
fraction
of
the
total
work
done
it
is
i
believe
the
only
mill
in
china
long
before
the
foreigner
set
foot
so
far
up
the
yangtze
hankow
was
a
city
of
great
importance
the
chinese
used
to
call
it
the
centre
of
the
world
ten
years
ago
i
should
have
been
thirty
days
hard
travel
from
peking
at
the
present
moment
i
might
pack
my
bag
and
be
in
peking
within
hours
hankow
with
tientsin
and
nanking
makes
up
the
trio
of
principal
strategic
points
of
the
empire
the
trio
of
centers
also
of
greatest
military
activity
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
i
can
see
the
provincial
capital
the
seat
of
the
viceroyalty
of
two
of
the
most
turbulent
and
important
provinces
of
the
whole
eighteen
hankow
and
have
a
population
of
something
like
two
million
people
and
it
is
safe
to
prophesy
that
no
other
centre
in
the
whole
world
has
a
greater
commercial
and
industrial
future
than
hankow
here
we
registered
as
british
subjects
and
secured
our
chinese
passports
resembling
naval
ensigns
more
than
anything
else
for
the
four
provinces
of
and
the
and
his
assistants
helped
us
in
many
ways
disillusioning
us
of
the
many
distorted
reports
which
have
got
into
print
regarding
the
indifference
shown
to
british
travelers
by
their
own
consuls
at
these
ports
we
found
the
brethren
at
the
hankow
club
a
happy
band
with
every
luxury
around
them
for
which
hand
and
heart
could
wish
so
that
it
were
perhaps
ludicrous
to
look
upon
them
as
exiles
men
out
in
the
outposts
of
britain
beyond
the
seas
building
up
the
trade
of
the
empire
yet
such
they
undoubtedly
were
most
of
them
having
a
much
better
time
than
they
would
at
home
there
is
not
the
roughing
required
in
hankow
which
is
necessary
in
other
parts
of
the
empire
as
in
british
east
africa
and
in
the
jungles
of
the
federated
malay
states
for
instance
building
the
empire
where
there
is
an
abundance
of
the
straw
wherewith
to
make
the
bricks
is
a
matter
of
no
difficulty
and
then
the
chinese
is
a
good
man
to
manage
in
trade
and
in
business
dealings
his
word
is
his
bond
generally
speaking
although
we
do
not
forget
that
not
long
ago
a
branch
in
north
china
of
the
and
shanghai
bank
was
swindled
seriously
by
a
shroff
who
had
done
honest
duty
for
a
great
number
of
years
it
can
not
however
be
said
that
such
behavior
is
a
common
thing
among
the
commercial
class
my
personal
experience
has
been
that
john
does
what
he
says
he
will
do
and
for
years
he
will
go
on
doing
that
one
thing
but
it
should
not
surprise
you
if
one
fine
morning
with
the
infinite
sagacity
of
his
race
he
ceases
to
do
this
when
you
are
least
expecting
it
and
he
does
you
keep
an
eye
on
him
and
the
chinese
to
be
found
in
hankow
having
dealings
with
europeans
in
business
is
as
good
as
the
best
of
men
we
wended
our
way
one
morning
into
the
native
city
and
agreed
that
few
inconveniences
of
the
celestial
empire
make
upon
the
western
mind
a
more
speedy
impression
than
the
entire
absence
of
sanitation
in
hankow
we
were
in
mental
suspense
as
to
which
was
the
filthier
native
city
hankow
or
shanghai
but
we
are
probably
like
other
travelers
who
find
each
city
visited
worse
than
the
last
should
there
arise
in
their
midst
a
man
anxious
to
confer
an
everlasting
blessing
upon
his
fellow
chinese
no
better
work
could
he
do
than
to
institute
a
system
approaching
what
to
our
western
mind
is
sanitation
we
arrived
of
course
in
the
winter
and
having
seen
it
at
a
time
when
the
sun
could
do
but
little
in
increasing
the
stenches
we
leave
to
the
imagination
what
it
would
be
in
the
summer
in
a
city
which
for
heat
is
not
excelled
by
aden
a
during
the
summer
of
no
less
than
foreigners
succumbed
to
cholera
and
the
native
deaths
were
numberless
the
people
were
suffering
very
much
from
the
cold
and
it
struck
me
as
one
of
the
unaccountable
phenomena
of
their
civilization
that
in
their
ingenuity
in
using
the
gifts
of
nature
they
have
never
learned
to
weave
wool
and
to
employ
it
in
clothing
that
is
in
a
general
sense
there
are
a
few
exceptions
in
the
empire
the
nation
is
almost
entirely
dependent
upon
cotton
for
clothing
which
in
winter
is
padded
with
a
cheap
wadding
to
an
abnormal
thickness
the
common
people
wear
no
underclothing
whatever
when
they
sleep
they
strip
to
the
skin
and
wrap
themselves
in
a
single
wadded
blanket
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
tired
people
their
excessive
labor
makes
them
and
although
their
clothes
might
be
the
height
of
discomfort
they
show
their
famous
indifference
to
comfort
by
never
complaining
these
burdensome
clothes
hang
around
them
like
so
many
bags
with
the
wide
gaps
here
and
there
where
the
wind
whistles
to
the
flesh
it
is
a
national
characteristic
that
they
are
immune
to
personal
inconveniences
a
philosophy
which
i
found
to
be
universal
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
everybody
we
met
from
the
british
downward
was
surprised
to
know
that
my
companion
and
i
had
no
knowledge
of
the
chinese
language
and
seemed
to
look
lightly
upon
our
chances
of
ever
getting
through
it
was
true
neither
my
companion
nor
myself
knew
three
words
of
the
language
but
went
forward
simply
believing
in
the
good
faith
of
the
chinese
people
with
our
passports
alone
to
protect
us
that
we
should
encounter
difficulties
innumerable
that
we
should
be
called
upon
to
put
up
with
the
greatest
hardships
of
life
when
viewed
from
the
standard
to
which
one
had
been
accustomed
and
that
we
should
be
put
to
great
physical
endurance
we
could
not
doubt
but
we
believed
in
the
chinese
and
believed
that
should
any
evil
befall
us
it
would
be
the
outcome
of
our
own
lack
of
forbearance
or
of
our
own
direct
seeking
we
knew
that
to
the
chinese
we
should
at
once
be
foreign
devils
and
barbarians
that
if
not
holding
us
actually
in
contempt
they
would
feel
some
condescension
in
dealing
and
mixing
with
us
but
i
was
personally
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
easier
for
us
to
walk
through
china
than
it
would
be
for
two
chinese
dressed
as
chinese
to
walk
through
great
britain
or
america
what
would
the
canny
highlander
or
the
rural
english
rustic
think
of
two
men
tramping
through
his
countryside
we
anchored
at
ichang
at
on
march
i
fell
up
against
a
boatman
who
offered
to
take
us
ashore
an
uglier
fellow
i
had
never
seen
in
the
east
the
morning
sunshine
soon
dried
the
decks
of
the
gunboat
then
stationed
in
the
river
for
the
defense
of
the
port
which
english
were
swabbing
in
a
sort
of
way
and
all
looked
rosy
enough
b
but
for
the
author
who
with
his
companion
was
a
literal
babe
in
the
wood
the
day
was
most
eventful
and
trying
to
one
personal
serenity
we
had
asked
questions
of
all
and
sundry
respecting
our
proposed
tramp
and
the
way
we
should
get
to
work
in
making
preparations
each
individual
person
seemed
vigorously
to
do
his
best
to
induce
us
to
turn
back
and
follow
callings
of
respectable
members
of
society
from
shanghai
upwards
we
might
have
believed
ourselves
watched
by
a
secret
society
which
had
for
its
motto
return
oh
wanderer
return
hardly
a
person
knew
aught
of
the
actual
conditions
of
the
interior
of
the
country
in
which
he
lived
and
labored
and
everyone
tried
to
dissuade
us
from
our
project
coming
ashore
in
good
spirits
we
called
at
the
consulate
at
the
back
of
the
city
graveyard
and
were
smoking
his
cigars
and
giving
his
boy
an
examination
in
elementary
english
when
the
consul
came
down
it
was
not
possible
however
for
us
to
get
much
more
information
than
we
had
read
up
and
the
consul
suggested
that
the
most
likely
person
to
be
of
use
to
us
would
be
the
missionary
at
the
china
inland
mission
thither
we
repaired
following
a
sturdy
employé
of
britain
but
we
found
that
the
representative
was
not
to
be
found
despite
our
repairing
so
off
we
trotted
to
the
chief
business
house
of
the
town
at
the
entrance
to
which
we
were
met
by
a
chinese
who
bowed
gravely
asked
whether
we
had
eaten
our
rice
and
told
us
quietly
but
pointedly
that
our
passing
up
the
rough
stone
steps
would
be
of
no
use
as
the
manager
was
out
a
few
minutes
later
i
stood
reading
the
inscription
on
the
gravestone
near
the
church
whilst
my
brave
companion
the
other
man
endeavored
fruitlessly
to
pacify
a
fierce
dog
in
the
doorway
of
the
scottish
missionary
premises
but
that
missionary
too
was
out
what
then
was
the
little
game
were
all
the
foreigners
resident
in
this
town
dodging
us
afraid
of
us
or
what
the
latter
the
blithering
idiots
yelled
the
other
man
he
was
infuriated
two
englishmen
with
english
tongues
in
their
heads
and
unable
to
direct
their
own
movements
preposterous
and
then
making
an
observation
which
i
will
not
print
he
suggested
mildly
that
we
might
fix
up
all
matters
ourselves
within
an
hour
an
one
piece
cook
had
secured
the
berth
which
carried
a
salary
of
dollars
per
month
we
were
well
on
the
way
with
the
engaging
of
our
boat
for
the
gorges
trip
and
one
by
one
our
troubles
vanished
laying
in
stores
however
was
not
the
lightest
of
sundry
perplexities
curry
and
rice
had
been
suggested
as
the
staple
diet
for
the
river
journey
and
we
ordered
with
no
thought
to
the
contrary
a
picul
of
best
rice
various
brands
of
curries
which
were
raked
from
behind
the
shelves
of
a
dingy
little
store
in
a
back
street
and
presented
to
us
at
alarming
prices
enough
to
last
a
regiment
of
soldiers
for
pretty
well
the
number
of
days
we
two
were
to
travel
and
for
luxuries
we
laid
in
a
few
tinned
meats
all
was
practically
settled
when
the
other
man
settling
his
eyes
dead
upon
me
yelled
dingle
you
forgotten
the
milk
and
then
after
a
moment
oh
well
we
can
surely
do
without
milk
it
no
use
coming
on
a
journey
like
this
unless
one
can
rough
it
a
bit
and
he
ended
up
with
a
rude
reference
to
the
disgusting
sticky
condensed
milk
tins
and
we
wandered
on
suddenly
he
stopped
did
the
other
man
he
looked
at
a
small
stone
on
the
pavement
for
a
long
time
eventually
cruelly
blurting
out
directly
at
me
as
if
it
were
all
my
misdoing
the
sugar
the
sugar
we
have
sugar
man
i
said
nothing
with
the
exception
of
a
slight
remark
that
we
might
do
without
sugar
as
we
were
to
do
without
milk
there
was
a
pause
then
raising
his
stick
in
the
air
the
other
man
perorated
now
i
have
no
wish
to
quarrel
and
he
put
his
nose
nearer
to
mine
you
know
that
of
course
but
to
we
can
do
without
sugar
is
quite
unreasonable
and
i
had
no
idea
you
were
such
a
cantankerous
man
we
have
sugar
or
i
go
back
we
had
sugar
it
was
brought
on
board
in
upwards
of
twenty
small
packets
of
that
detestable
thin
chinese
paper
and
the
other
man
with
commendable
meekness
withdrew
several
pleasantries
he
had
unwittingly
dropped
anent
deficiencies
in
my
upbringing
fifty
pounds
of
this
sugar
were
ordered
and
sugar
that
dirty
brown
sticky
stuff
got
into
everything
on
board
my
fingers
are
sticky
even
as
i
write
and
no
less
than
exactly
went
down
to

yangtze
travelers
by
houseboat
on
the
upper
yangtze
should
have
some
knowledge
of
commissariat
getting
away
was
a
tedious
business
later
the
fellows
pressed
us
to
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
in
the
small
dingy
apartment
they
are
pleased
to
call
their
club
and
the
skipper
had
to
recommission
his
boat
get
in
provisions
for
the
voyage
engage
his
crew
pay
off
debts
and
attend
to
a
thousand
and
one
minute
details
all
to
be
done
after
the
contract
to
carry
the
madcap
passengers
had
been
signed
and
sealed
added
to
the
more
practical
triviality
of
of
the
charge
being
paid
down
and
then
our
captain
to
add
to
the
dilemma
vociferously
yelled
to
us
in
some
unknown
jargon
which
got
on
our
nerves
terribly
that
he
was
waiting
for
a
lucky
day
to
raise
anchor
however
we
did
as
the
reader
will
be
able
to
imagine
eventually
get
away
amid
the
firing
of
countless
deafening
crackers
after
having
watched
the
sacrifice
of
a
cock
to
the
god
of
the
river
with
the
invocation
that
we
might
be
kept
in
safety
poling
and
rowing
through
a
maze
of
junks
our
little
floating
caravan
with
the
two
magnates
on
board
and
their
picul
of
rice
their
curry
and
their
sugar
and
slenderest
outfits
bowled
along
under
plain
sail
the
packed
with
a
motley
team
of
somewhat
dirty
and
trackers
who
whistled
and
halloed
the
peculiar
hallo
of
the
upper
yangtze
for
more
wind
the
little
township
of
ichang
was
soon
left
astern
and
we
entered
speedily
to
all
intents
and
purposes
into
a
new
world
a
world
untrammelled
by
conventionalism
and
the
spirit
of
the
west

like
a

falling
slowly
and
impenetrably
over
all
things
a
vivid
but
broken
flash
of
lightning
blazing
in
a
flare
of
blue
and
amber
poured
livid
reflections
and
illuminated
with
dreadful
distinctness
if
only
for
one
ghastly
moment
the
stupendous
cliffs
of
the
ichang
gorge
whose
steepness
suddenly
became
darkened
as
black
as
ink
thus
with
a
grand
impressiveness
this
great
gully
in
the
mountains
assumed
hugely
gigantic
proportions
stretching
interminably
from
east
to
west
up
to
heaven
and
down
to
earth
silhouetted
to
the
north
against
a
small
remaining
patch
of
golden
purple
whose
weird
glamour
seemed
awesomely
to
herald
the
coming
of
a
new
world
into
being
lasting
but
for
a
moment
longer
until
again
the
blue
blaze
quickly
cut
up
the
sky
into
a
thousand
shreds
and
tiny
silver
bars
and
then
suddenly
with
a
vast
down
swoop
as
if
some
colossal
bird
were
taking
the
earth
under
her
wings
dense
darkness
fell
impenetrable
sooty
darkness
that
in
a
moment
shut
out
all
light
all
power
of
sight
then
from
out
the
sombre
heavens
deep
thunder
boomed
ominously
as
the
reverberating
roar
of
a
pack
of
lions
and
the
two
men
aliens
in
an
alien
land
stood
beneath
the
tattered
matting
awning
with
a
peculiar
fear
and
some
foreboding
we
were
tied
in
fast
to
the
darkened
sides
of
the
great
ichang
gorge
a
magnificent
stretch
opening
up
the
famous
gorges
on
the
fourth
of
the
great
rivers
of
the
world
which
had
cleaved
its
course
through
a
chain
of
hills
whose
perpendicular
cliffs
form
wonderful
banks
dispelling
all
thought
of
the
monotony
of
the
lower
yangtze
upstream
we
had
glided
merrily
upon
a
fresh
breeze
which
bore
the
warning
of
a
storm
all
on
board
was
settling
down
into
yangtze
fashion
and
the
barbaric
human
clamor
of
our
trackers
which
now
mutteringly
died
away
was
suddenly
taken
up
as
above
recorded
and
all
unexpectedly
answered
by
a
grander
uproar
a
deep
threatening
boom
of
thunder
in
circling
tones
and
semitones
of
wrath
it
volleyed
gradually
through
the
dark
ravines
and
startled
by
the
sound
the
two
travelers
roused
for
the
first
time
from
their
natural
engrossment
in
the
common
doings
of
the
c
saw
the
reflection
of
the
sun
on
the
waters
now
turned
to
a
livid
murkiness
deepening
with
a
threatening
aspect
as
the
river
rushed
voluminously
past
our
tiny
floating
haven
strangely
silenced
were
we
by
this
weird
terror
and
watched
and
listened
chained
to
the
deck
by
a
thousand
mingled
fears
and
fascinations
which
breathed
upon
our
nerves
like
a
chill
wind
as
we
became
accustomed
then
to
the
yellow
darkness
we
beheld
about
the
landscape
a
spectral
look
and
the
sepulchral
sound
of
the
moving
thunder
seemed
the
clang
of
some
great
funeral
bell
then
came
the
rain
introduced
swiftly
by
the
deafening
clatter
of
another
thunder
crash
that
made
one
stagger
like
a
ship
in
a
wild
sea
and
we
strained
our
eyes
to
gaze
into
a
visionary
chasm
cleaved
in
twain
by
the
furious
lightning
playing
upon
the
face
of
the
unruffled
river
with
a
brilliancy
at
once
awful
and
enchanting
this
singular
flitting
and
wavering
of
the
heavenly
electricity
as
it
flashed
haphazardly
around
all
things
threw
about
one
an
illumination
quite
indescribable
for
hours
we
sat
upon
a
beam
athwart
the
afterdeck
in
silence
drinking
in
the
strange
phenomenon
we
watched
after
a
small
feed
of
curry
and
rice
long
into
the
dark
hours
when
the
thunder
had
passed
us
by
and
in
the
distant
booming
one
could
now
imagine
the
lower
notes
streaming
forth
from
some
great
solemn
organ
symphony
the
fierce
lightning
twitched
as
it
danced
in
and
out
the
crevices
inwards
outwards
upwards
then
finally
lost
in
one
downward
swoop
towards
the
river
tearing
open
the
liquid
blackness
with
its
crystal
blade
of
fire
the
rain
ceased
not
but
soon
the
moon
peeping
out
from
the
tops
of
a
jagged
wall
above
us
looking
like
a
soiled
snowball
shone
full
down
the
gorge
and
now
its
broad
lustre
shed
itself
like
powdered
silver
over
the
whole
scene
so
that
one
could
have
imagined
oneself
in
the
living
splendor
of
some
eternal
sphere
of
ethereal
sweetness
and
so
it
might
have
been
had
the
rain
abated
a
curious
accompaniment
to
a
moonlight
night
down
it
came
straight
and
determined
and
businesslike
in
the
windless
silence
dancing
like
a
shower
of
diamonds
of
purest
brilliance
on
the
background
of
the
placid
waters
very
beautiful
reader
for
a
time
but
would
that
the
rain
had
been
all
moonshine
glorious
was
it
to
revel
in
for
a
time
but
during
the
weary
night
watches
in
a
bed
long
since
soaked
through
and
one
safest
nightclothes
now
the
stolid
burberry
with
face
protected
by
a
umbrella
even
one
curry
and
rice
saturated
to
sap
with
the
constant
drip
and
everything
around
one
rendered
cold
and
uncomfortable
enough
through
a
perforation
in
its
slenderest
part
of
the
bamboo
matting
ah
it
was
then
that
one
would
have
foregone
with
alacrity
the
dreams
of
the
nomadic
life
of
the
our
introduction
therefore
to
the
great
gorges
of
the
upper
yangtze
to
china
what
the
niagara
falls
are
to
america
was
not
remarkable
for
its
placidity
albeit
taken
with
as
much
complacency
as
the
occasion
allowed
i
do
not
however
intend
to
weary
or
to
entertain
the
reader
as
may
be
by
a
long
description
of
the
yangtze
gorges
time
and
time
again
have
they
fallen
to
the
imaginative
pens
of
travelers
mostly
bad
or
indifferent
descriptions
few
good
none
better
perhaps
than
bishop
but
at
best
they
are
imaginative
they
lack
reality
it
has
been
said
that
the
world
of
imagination
is
the
world
of
eternity
and
as
of
eternity
so
of
the
gorges
they
can
not
be
adequately
described
as
i
write
now
in
the
ichang
gorge
i
seem
veritably
to
have
reached
eternity
i
seem
to
have
arrived
at
the
bosom
of
an
where
one
body
has
ceased
to
vegetate
and
where
in
an
infinite
and
eternal
world
of
imagination
one
soul
expands
with
fullest
freedom
there
seems
to
exist
in
this
eternal
world
of
unending
rock
and
invulnerable
precipice
permanent
realities
which
stand
from
eternity
to
eternity
as
the
oak
dies
and
leaves
its
eternal
image
in
the
seed
which
never
dies
so
these
grand
ravines
abused
and
disabused
as
may
be
go
on
for
ever
despite
the
scribblers
and
one
finds
the
best
in
his
imagination
returning
by
some
to
contemplative
thought
but
as
a
casual
traveler
may
i
say
that
the
first
experience
i
had
of
the
gorges
made
me
modest
patient
conscious
of
significant
insignificance
conscious
of
the
unspeakable
wondrous
grandeur
of
this
unvisited
corner
of
the
world
a
spot
in
which
blustering
selfish
persons
will
not
fare
well
humility
and
patience
are
the
first
requisites
in
traveling
on
the
upper
yangtze
reader
for
your
sake
i
refrain
from
a
description
but
may
i
for
perhaps
your
sake
too
if
you
would
wander
hither
ere
the
charm
of
things
as
they
were
in
the
beginning
is
still
unrobbed
and
unmolested
give
you
some
few
impressions
of
a
little
of
the
life
grave
gay
but
never
unhappy
which
i
spent
with
my
excellent
the
other
man
it
is
a
part
of
wisdom
when
starting
any
journey
not
to
look
forward
to
the
end
with
too
much
eagerness
hear
my
gentle
whisper
that
you
may
never
get
there
and
if
you
do
congratulate
yourself
interest
yourself
in
the
progress
of
the
journey
for
the
present
only
is
yours
each
day
has
its
tasks
its
rapids
its
perils
its
glories
its
fascinations
its
surprises
and
if
you
will
live
as
we
did
its
and
then
if
you
are
traveling
with
a
companion
remember
that
it
is
better
to
yield
a
little
than
to
quarrel
a
great
deal
most
disagreeable
and
undignified
is
it
anywhere
to
get
into
the
habit
of
standing
up
for
what
people
are
pleased
to
call
their
little
rights
but
nowhere
more
so
than
on
the
upper
yangtze
houseboat
under
the
gaze
of
a
yangtze
crew
life
is
really
too
short
for
continual
bickering
and
to
my
way
of
thinking
it
is
far
quieter
happier
more
prudent
and
productive
of
more
peace
if
one
could
yield
a
little
of
those
precious
little
rights
than
to
incessantly
squabble
to
maintain
them
therefore
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
trip
make
the
best
of
everything
in
every
way
and
i
can
assure
you
if
you
are
not
and
suffer
not
from
your
liver
nature
will
open
her
bosom
and
lead
you
by
these
strange
into
her
hidden
charms
and
unadorned
recesses
of
sublime
beauty
uneclipsed
for
their
kind
anywhere
in
the
world
think
not
that
the
life
will
be
luxurious
houseboat
life
on
the
upper
yangtze
is
decidedly
not
luxurious
were
it
not
for
the
magnificence
of
the
scenery
and
outdoor
surroundings
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
long
river
journey
would
probably
become
unbearably
dull
our
was
to
get
through
the
gorges
in
as
short
a
time
as
was
possible
and
for
that
reason
we
traveled
in
the
discomfort
of
the
smallest
boat
used
to
face
the
rapids
people
entertaining
the
smallest
idea
of
doing
things
travel
in
nothing
short
of
a
the
orthodox
houseboat
with
several
rooms
and
ordinary
conveniences
ours
was
a
literally
five
boards
we
had
no
conveniences
whatever
and
the
second
morning
out
we
were
left
without
even
a
as
i
was
standing
in
the
stern
i
saw
it
swirling
away
from
us
and
inquiring
through
a
heard
the
perplexing
explanation
of
my
boy
gesticulating
violently
he
told
us
how
with
the
in
his
hand
he
had
been
pushed
by
one
of
the
crew
and
how
loosened
from
his
grasp
my
toilet
ware
had
been
gripped
by
the
river
and
now
appeared
far
down
the
stream
like
a
large
bead
the
other
man
was
alarmed
at
the
boy
discomfiture
ejaculated
something
about
the
loss
being
quite
irreparable
and
with
a
loud
laugh
and
quite
natural
hilarity
proceeded
quietly
to
use
a
saucepan
as
a
combined
and
it
did
quite
well
for
this
in
the
morning
and
during
the
day
resumed
its
duty
as
seat
for
me
at
the
typewriter
our
boy
apart
from
this
small
misfortune
comported
himself
pretty
well
his
english
was
understandable
and
he
could
cook
anything
he
dished
us
up
excellent
soup
in
enamelled
cups
and
as
we
had
no
ingredients
on
board
so
far
as
we
knew
to
make
soup
and
as
the
other
man
had
that
day
lost
an
old
spanish
we
naturally
concluded
that
he
had
used
the
old
hat
for
the
making
of
the
soup
and
at
once
christened
it
as
consommé
à
la
maotsi
and
we
can
recommend
it
after
we
had
grown
somewhat
tired
of
the
eternal
curry
and
rice
we
asked
him
quietly
if
he
could
not
make
us
something
else
fearing
a
rebuff
he
stood
hesitatingly
before
us
gazing
into
nothingness
his
face
was
pallid
his
lips
hard
set
and
his
stooping
figure
looking
curiously
stiff
and
lifeless
on
that
frozen
morning
the
temperature
below
freezing
point
and
our
noses
were
red
too
god
bless
the
man
you
no
savee
i
wantchee
good
chow
why
in
the
name
of
goodness
ca
you
give
us
something
decent
what
on
earth
did
you
come
for
alas
he
shouted
for
we
were
at
a
rapid
my
savee
makee
good
chow
no
have
got
nothing
no
have
got
nothing
no
have
got
nothing
mysterious
words
what
could
they
mean
where
then
was
our
picul
of
rice
and
our
curry
and
our
sugar
the
fellow
a
swindler
cried
the
other
man
in
an
angry
semitone
but
that
all
very
well
no
have
got
nothing
ah
there
lay
the
secret
presently
the
other
man
head
of
the
general
commissariat
spoke
again
with
touching
eloquence
he
gave
the
boy
to
understand
that
we
were
powerless
to
alter
or
soften
the
conditions
of
the
larder
that
we
were
victims
of
a
horrible
destiny
that
we
entertained
no
stinging
malice
towards
him
personally
but
he
do
it
either
a
great
wrath
or
a
great
sorrow
overcame
the
boy
he
skulked
past
asked
us
to
lie
down
on
our
shelves
where
we
had
our
beds
to
give
him
room
and
then
set
to
work
in
minutes
we
had
a
meal
all
out
of
the
same
pot
but
no
matter
and
onwards
to
our
destination
we
fed
royally
in
parting
with
the
men
after
our
safe
arrival
at
we
left
with
them
about
of
the
picul
and
were
not
at
all
regretful
i
should
not
like
to
assert
because
i
am
telling
the
truth
here
that
our
boat
was
bewilderingly
roomy
as
a
matter
of
fact
its
length
was
some
forty
feet
its
width
seven
feet
its
depth
much
less
and
it
drew
eight
inches
of
water
yet
in
it
we
had
our
our
our
our
library
our
occasional
our
and
all
else
if
we
stood
bolt
upright
in
the
saloon
amidships
we
bumped
our
heads
on
the
bamboo
matting
which
formed
an
arched
roof
on
the
nose
of
the

one
of

discomforts
the

first
experiences
is
due
to
a
total
ignorance
of

the
main
rapids

often
therefore
when
he
is
least
expecting
it
perhaps
he
is
called
upon

values

himself
his

and
one
who
has
no
knowledge
of
the
language
and
does
not
know
the
ropes
is
therefore
never
quite
happy
for
fear
of
some
rapid
turning
up
by
comparing
the
rapids
with
the
gorges
the
traveler
would
however
from
the
lists
given
be
able
easily
to

watch

to
feel
again
the
sensation
the
captain
in
essentially
the
chinese
way
is
engaging
a
crew
of
trackers
to
haul
her
over
pouring
towards
the
boat
in
a
fever
of
excitement
that
rises
higher
every

the
natural
elements
of
hunger
and
constant
struggle
against
the

river
swell
their
fury

like

like
for
they

struggle
all

they
have
always
since
they

fighting
this
roaring

monster
they
know
none

now
as
i

they
bellow
like

ravenously
eager
to
be

chosen
to
earn
a

cash
d
the
arrangement
at

is
made
and
the
discordant
hubbub
instead
of
lessening
grows
more
and
more
deafening
it
is
a
miserable
desperate
wholly
crowd
that
then
harnesses
up
with
their
great
hooks
joined
to
a
rough
with
which
they
connect
themselves
to
the
straining
and
now
her
nose
is
put
into
the
teeth
of
this
trough
of
treachery
a
veritable
boiling
cauldron
stirring
up
all
past
mysteries
waves
rush
furiously
towards
us
with
the
growl
of
a
thousand
demons
whose
anger
is
only
swelled
by
the
thousands
of
miles
of
her
course
from
tibet
it
seems
as
if
they
must
instantly
devour
her
and
that
we
must
now
go
under
to
swell
the
number
of
their
victims
but
they
only
beat
her
back
for
she
rides
gracefully
faltering
timidly
with
frightened
creaks
and
groans
whilst
the
waters
shiver
her
frail
bulwarks
with
their
cruel
message
of
destruction
which
might
mean
her
very
i
get
landed
in
the
stomach
with
the
end
of
a
gigantic
bamboo
used
by
one
of
the
men
standing
in
the
bows
whose
duty
is
to
fend
her
off
the
rocks
he
falls
towards
the
river
i
grab
his
single
garment
give
one
swift
pull
and
he
comes
up
again
with
a
jerky
little
laugh
and
asks
if
he
has
hurt
me
yelling
through
his
hands
in
my
ears
for
the
noise
is
terrible
to
look
out
over
the
side
makes
me
giddy
for
the
current
blustering
and
bubbling
and
foaming
and
leaping
gives
one
the
feeling
that
he
is
in
an
express
train
tearing
through
the
sea
on
shore
far
ahead
i
can
see
the
trackers
struggling
forms
of
men
and
women
touching
each
other
grasping
each
other
wrestling
furiously
and
mightily
straining
on
all
fours
now
gripping
a
boulder
to
aid
them
forward
now
to
the
right
now
to
the
left
always
fighting
for
one
more
inch
and
engaged
in
a
task
which
to
one
seeing
it
for
the
first
time
looks
as
if
it
were
quite
beyond
human
effort
fagged
and
famished
beings
are
these
trackers
whose
life
day
after
day
week
in
week
out
is
harder
than
that
of
the
average
costermonger
donkey
they
throw
up
their
hands
in
a
dumb
frenzy
of
protest
and
futile
appeal
to
the
presiding
deity
and
here
on
the
river
depending
entirely
upon
those
men
on
the
shore
slowly
inch
by
inch
the
little
craft
feeling
her
own
weakness
forges
ahead
against
the
leaping
current
in
the
gapway
in
the
reef
none
come
to
offer
assistance
to
our
crowd
who
are
now
turned
facing
us
and
strain
almost
flat
on
their
backs
giving
the
strength
of
every
drop
of
blood
and
fibre
of
their
being
and
the
scene
now
lit
up
by
a
momentary
glimmer
of
feeble
sunlight
assumes
a
wonderful
and
terrible
picturesqueness
i
am
chained
to
the
spot
by
a
horrible
fascination
and
i
find
myself
unconsciously
saying
i
fear
she
will
not
go
i
fear
but
a
man
has
fallen
exhausted
he
almost
fell
overboard
and
now
leans
against
the
mast
in
utter
weariness
and
fatigue
brought
on
by
the
morning
exertions
he
is
instantly
relieved
by
a
fellow
of
enormous
strength
now
comes
the
culminating
point
a
truly
terrifying
moment
the
very
anguish
of
which
frightened
me
as
i
looked
around
for
the
lifeboat
and
i
saw
that
even
the
commodore
cold
and
dignity
was
disturbed
the
hawsers
strain
again
creak
crack
creak
crack
the
lifeboat
watches
and
comes
nearer
to
us
there
is
a
mighty
yell
we
can
not
go
yes
we
can
there
is
a
mighty
pull
and
you
feel
the
boat
almost
torn
asunder
another
mighty
pull
a
tremendous
quiver
of
the
timbers
and
you
turn
to
see
the
angry
water
which
sounds
as
if
a
hundred
hounds
are
beating
under
us
for
entry
at
the
barred
door
there
is
another
deafening
yell
the
men
tear
away
like
frightened
horses
another
mighty
pull
and
another
and
another
and
we
slide
over
into
smooth
water
then
i
breathe
freely
and
yell
myself
the
little
boat
seems
to
gasp
for
breath
as
a
drowning
man
saved
in
the
nick
of
time
shudders
in
every
limb
with
pain
and
fear
as
we
tied
up
in
smooth
water
all
the
men
from
the
to
the
meanest
tracker
laughed
and
yelled
and
told
each
other
how
it
was
done
we
baled
the
water
out
of
the
boat
and
one
was
glad
to
pull
away
from
the
deafening
hum
of
the
thundering
cataract
a
faulty
a
slippery
hitch
one
false
step
one
false
maneuver
and
the
shore
might
have
been
by
that
time
strewn
with
our
corpses
as
it
was
we
were
safe
and
happy
but
the
trackers
are
strange
creatures
at
times
they
are
a
quarter
of
a
mile
ahead
soft
echoes
of
their
coarse
chanting
came
down
the
confines
of
the
gully
after
the
rapid
had
been
passed
and
in
rounding
a
rocky
promontory
one
would
catch
sight
of
them
bending
their
bodies
in
pulling
steadily
against
the
current
of
the
river
occasionally
one
of
these
poor
fellows
slips
there
is
a
shriek
his
body
is
dashed
unmercifully
against
the
jagged
cliffs
in
its
last
journey
to
the
river
which
carries
the
multilated
corpse
away
and
yet
these
men
engaged
in
this
terrific
toil
with
utmost
danger
to
their
lives
live
almost
exclusively
on
boiled
rice
and
dirty
cabbage
and
receive
the
merest
pittance
in
money
at
the
journey
end
some
idea
of
the
force
of
this
enormous
volume
of
water
may
be
given
by
mentioning
the
exploits
of
the
steamer
which
on
three
consecutive
occasions
attacked
the
yeh
when
at
its
worst
and
though
steaming
a
good
fourteen
knots
failed
to
ascend
she
was
obliged
to
lay
out
a
long
hawser
and
heave
herself
over
by
means
of
her
windlass
the
engines
working
at
full
speed
at
the
same
time
hard
and
heavy
was
the
heave
gaining
foot
by
foot
with
a
tension
on
the
hawser
almost
to
breaking
strain
in
a
veritable
battle
against
the
dragon
of
the
river
yet
so
complete
are
the
changes
which
are
wrought
by
the
great
variation
in
the
level
of
the
river
that
this
formidable
rapid
completely
disappears
at
high
level
after
we
had
left
this
rapid
and
right
glad
were
we
to
get
away
we
came
after
a
couple
of
hours
run
to
the
niu
or
buffalo
mouth
reach
quiet
enough
during
the
season
but
a
wild
stretch
during
high
river
where
many
a
junk
is
caught
by
the
violently
gyrating
swirls
rendered
unmanageable
and
dashed
to
atoms
on
some
rocky
promontory
or
boulder
pile
in
as
short
a
space
of
time
as
it
takes
to
write
it
it
was
here
that
the
one
of
the
magnificent
gunboats
which
patrol
the
river
to
safeguard
the
interests
of
the
union
jack
in
this
region
came
to
grief
on
her
maiden
trip
to
one
of
these
strong
swirls
caught
the
ship
stern
rendering
her
rudders
useless
for
the
moment
and
causing
her
to
sheer
broadside
into
the
foaming
rapid
the
engines
were
immediately
reversed
to
full
speed
astern
but
the
swift
current
combined
with
the
momentum
of
the
ship
carried
her
to
the
shore
on
which
she
crumpled
her
bows
as
if
they
were
made
of
tin
fortunately
she
was
built
in
sections
her
engineers
removed
the
forward
section
straightened
out
the
crumpled
plates
riveted
them
together
and
bolted
the
section
back
into
its
place
again
so
well
that
on
arrival
at
not
a
trace
of
the
accident
was
visible
upon
arrival
at
kweifu
one
bids
farewell
to
the
gorges
this
town
formerly
a
considerable
coaling
center
overlooks
most
beautiful
hillocks
with
cottage
gardens
cultivated
in
every
accessible
corner
and
a
wide
sweep
of
the
river
we
landed
with
difficulty
chor
chor
yelled
the
trackers
who
marked
time
to
their
cry
swinging
their
arms
to
and
fro
at
each
short
step
but
they
almost
gave
up
the
ghost
however
we
did
land
and
so
did
our
boy
who
bought
excellent
provisions
and
meat
which
alas
too
soon
disappeared
the
mutton
and
beef
gradually
grew
less
and
daily
blackened
wrapped
up
in
opposite
corners
of
the
cabin
under
the
protection
from
the
wet
of
a
couple
of
sheets
of
the
pink
from
kweifu
to
wan
hsien
there
was
the
same
kind
of
scenery
the
clear
river
winding
among
and
with
occasional
stiff
rapids
but
after
having
been
in
a
for
several
days
suffering
that
which
has
been
detailed
and
much
besides
the
journey
got
a
bit
dreary
these
however
are
ordinary
circumstances
but
when
one
has
been
laid
up
on
a
bench
of
a
bed
for
three
days
with
a
high
temperature
a
legacy
of
several
years
in
the
humid
tropics

physical
discomfort

description
malaria
as
all
sufferers
know
has
a
tendency
to
cause
trouble
as
soon
as
one
gets
into
cold
weather
and
in
my
case
as
will
be
seen
in
subsequent
parts
of
this
book
it
held
faithfully
to
its
best
traditions
fever
on
the
yangtze
in
a
would
require
a
chapter
to
itself
not
to
mention
the
kindly
eccentricities
of
a
companion
whose
knowledge
of
malaria
was
most
elementary
and
whose
knowledge
of
nursing
absolutely
but
i
refrain
as
also
do
i
of
further
talk
about
the
yangtze
gorges
and
the
rapids
from
kweifu
to
wan
hsien
is
a
tedious
journey
the
country
opens
out
and
is
more
or
less
monotonously
flat
the
majority
of
the
dangers
and
difficulties
however
are
over
and
one
is
able
to
settle
down
in
comparative
peace
fortunately
for
the
author
nothing
untoward
happened
but
travelers
are
warned
not
to
be
too
sanguine
wrecks
have
happened
within
a
few
miles
of
the
destination
generally
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
unhappy
knack
the
chinese
boatman
has
of
taking
all
precautions
where
the
dangerous
rapids
exist
and
leaving
all
to
chance
elsewhere
some
two
years
later
as
i
was
coming
down
the
river
from
in
december
i
counted
no
less
than
nine
wrecks
one
boat
having
on
board
a
cargo
for
the
china
inland
mission
authorities
of
no
less
than
boxes
the
contents
were
spread
out
on
the
banks
to
dry
while
the
boat
was
turned
upside
down
and
repaired
on
the
spot
a
hopeless
cry
is
continually
ascending
in
and
shanghai
that
trade
is
bad
that
the
palmy
days
are
gone
and
that
one
might
as
well
leave
business
to
take
care
of
itself
and
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
increased
trade
in
the
far
east
does
not
of
necessity
mean
increased
profits
competition
has
rendered
buying
and
selling
if
they
are
to
show
increased
dividends
a
much
harder
task
than
some
of
the
older
merchants
had
when
they
built
up
their
businesses
twenty
or
thirty
years
ago
there
is
no
comparison
but
by
virtue
of
her
remarkably
favorable
position
geographically
should
always
be
able
to
hold
her
own
and
now
that
the
railway
has
pierced
the
great
province
of
and
brought
the
provinces
beyond
the
navigable
yangtze
nearer
to
the
outside
world
she
should
be
able
to
reap
a
big
harvest
in
western
china
if
merchants
will
move
at
the
right
time
more
often
than
not
the
britisher
loses
his
trade
not
on
account
of
the
alleged
reason
that
business
is
not
to
be
done
but
because
content
with
his
club
life
and
with
playing
games
when
he
should
be
doing
business
he
allows
the
german
to
rush
past
him
and
this
man
an
alien
in
the
colony
by
persistent
plodding
and
other
more
or
less
commendable
traits
of
business
which
i
should
like
to
detail
but
for
which
i
have
no
space
takes
away
the
trade
while
the
britisher
looks
on
the
whole
of
the
trade
of
the
three
western
provinces
and
has
for
all
time
been
handled
by
shanghai
going
into
the
interior
by
the
extremely
hazardous
route
of
these
yangtze
rapids
and
then
over
the
mountains
by
coolie
or
this
has
gone
on
for
centuries
but
now
the
time
has
come
for
the
trader
to
step
in
and
carry
away
the
lion
share
of
the
greatly
increasing
foreign
trade
for
those
three
provinces
by
means
of
the
advantage
the
new
railway
has
given
him
the
railway
runs
from
haiphong
in
to
the
capital
of
province
and
it
appears
certain
to
the
writer
that
with
such
an
important
town
three
or
four
days
from
the
coast
shippers
will
not
be
content
to
continue
to
ship
via
the
yangtze
with
all
its
risk
british
and
american
merchants
who
carry
the
greater
part
of
the
imports
to
western
china
will
send
their
goods
direct
to
where
transhipment
will
be
made
to
haiphong
and
thence
shipped
by
rail
to
the
distributing
center
for
inland
trade
to
my
mind
merchants
might
control
the
whole
of
the
british
trade
of
western
china
if
they
will
only
push
for
although
the
tariff
of
tonkin
may
be
heavy
it
would
be
compensated
by
the
fact
that
transit
would
be
so
much
quicker
and
safer
but
it
needs
push
the
history
of
our
intercourse
with
china
from
the
days
of
the
east
india
company
till
now
is
nothing
but
a
record
of
a
continuous
struggle
to
open
up
and
develop
trade
opening
up
trade
too
with
a
people
who
have
something
pathetic
in
the
honest
persistency
with
which
their
officials
have
vainly
struggled
to
keep
themselves
uncontaminated
from
the
outside
world
trade
in
china
can
not
be
left
to
take
care
of
itself
as
is
done
in
western
countries
however
invidious
it
may
seem
we
must
admit
the
fact
that
past
progress
has
been
due
to
pressure
therefore
if
the
opportunities
were
placed
near
at
hand
to
the
shipper
he
would
be
an
unenterprising
person
indeed
were
he
not
to
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
shanghai
has
held
the
trump
card
formerly
this
can
not
be
denied
but
i
think
the
railway
is
destined
to
turn
the
trade
route
to
the
other
side
of
the
empire
it
is
merely
a
question
as
to
who
is
to
get
the
trade
the
french
or
the
british
the
french
are
on
the
alert
they
can
not
get
territory
now
they
are
after
the
trade
it
is
my
opinion
that
it
would
be
to
the
advantage
of
the
colony
of
were
the
chamber
of
commerce
there
to
investigate
the
matter
thoroughly

my
companion
having
had
to
leave
me
here
it
was
easter
sunday
a
crisp
spring
morning
first
came
a
public
bravely
borne
by
three
of
the
finest
fellows
in
all
china
at
the
head
of
which
on
either
side
were
two
uniformed
persons
called
soldiers
incomprehensible
to
one
who
has
no
knowledge
of
the
interior
for
they
bore
no
marks
whatever
of
the
military
whilst
uniformed
men
also
solemnly
guarded
the
back
then
came
the
grinning
coolies
carrying
that
meager
portion
of
my
worldly
goods
which
i
had
anticipated
would
have
been
engulfed
in
the
yangtze
and
at
the
head
of
all
leading
them
on
as
captains
do
the
salvation
army
was
i
myself
walking
along
triumphantly
undoubtedly
looking
a
person
of
weight
but
somehow
peculiarly
unable
to
get
out
of
my
head
that
little
adage
apropos
the
fact
that
when
the
blind
shall
lead
the
blind
both
shall
fall
into
a
ditch
but
chinese
decorum
forbade
my
falling
behind
i
had
determined
to
walk
across
china
every
inch
of
the
way
or
not
at
all
and
the
chair
coolies
unaware
of
my
intentions
presumably
thought
it
a
great
joke
when
at
the
western
gate
through
which
i
departed
i
gave
instructions
that
one
hundred
cash
be
doled
out
to
each
man
for
his
graciousness
in
escorting
me
through
the
town
all
the
people
were
in
the
middle
of
the
streets
those
slippery
streets
of
interminable
steps
to
give
me
at
parting
their
blessings
or
their
curses
and
only
with
difficulty
and
considerable
shouting
and
pushing
could
i
sufficiently
take
their
attention
from
the
array
of
official
and

that
he
narrowly
escaped
being
knocked
down
owing
to
his
extremely
rude
persistence
in
accosting
me
and
obstructing

he
acquiesced
opened
his
large
mouth
to
the

proportions
seemed
thoroughly
to
understand
but
continued
more
noisily
to
prevent
me
from
going
onwards
yelling
something
at
the
top
of
his
husky
voice
a
voice
more
like
a
than
a
human
voice
which
made
me
fear
that
i
had
done
something
very
wrong

which
later
i
interpreted
ignorantly

i

wildly
upon
the
man
after
the

kind
raising
his
little
fat
body
to
the
tips
of
his

and
effectively

the

he
cursed
loudly

the

ten

which
although
it
called
forth
more
mutual

made
my

foam
at
the
mouth
with
rage
at
such
an
inopportune
proceeding
happening
so
early
in

rendering
it
necessary
for
him
to

that

least
attractive
features
being
the
cement
and
a
small
polo
ground
adjoining
i
had
hoped
to
see
polo
on
those
little
rats
of
ponies
but
it
could
not
be
arranged
i
should
have
liked
to
take
a
stick
as
a
farewell
people
were
shocked
indeed
that
i
was
going
to
walk
across
china
let
me
say
here
that
travel
in
the
middle
kingdom
is
quite
possible
anywhere
provided
that
you
are
fit
you
have
merely
to
learn
and
to
maintain
untold
patience
and
you
are
able
to
get
where
you
like
if
you
have
got
the
money
to
pay
your
way
e
but
walking
is
a
very
different
thing
it
is
probable
that
never
previously
has
a
traveler
actually
walked
across
china
if
we
except
the
rev
mccarthy
of
the
china
inland
mission
who
some
thirty
years
or
so
ago
did
walk
across
to
burma
although
he
went
through
province
over
a
considerably
easier
country
not
because
it
is
by
any
means
physically
impossible
but
because
the
custom
of
the
country
and
a
cursed
custom
too
is
that
one
has
to
keep
what
is
called
his
face
and
to
walk
tends
to
make
a
man
lose
face
a
quiet
jaunt
through
china
on
foot
was
i
was
told
quite
out
of
the
question
the
uneclipsed
audacity
of
a
man
mentioning
it
and
especially
a
man
such
as
i
was
was
marvelled
at
did
i
not
know
that
the
foreigner
have
a
chair
this
was
corroborated
by
my
boy
on
his
oath
because
he
would
have
to
pay
the
men
did
i
not
know
that
no
traveler
in
western
china
who
at
any
rate
had
any
sense
of
would
travel
without
a
chair
not
necessarily
as
a
conveyance
but
for
the
honor
and
glory
of
the
thing
and
did
i
not
know
that
unfurnished
with
this
undeniable
token
of
respect
i
should
be
liable
to
be
thrust
aside
on
the
highway
to
be
kept
waiting
at
ferries
to
be
relegated
to
the
worst
inn
worst
room
and
to
be
generally
treated
with
indignity
this
idea
of
mine
of
crossing
china
on
foot
was
preposterous
even
hudson
broomhall
of
the
china
inland
mission
who
with
broomhall
was
extremely
kind
and
did
all
he
could
to
fit
me
up
for
the
journey
it
is
such
remembrances
that
make
the
trip
one
which
i
would
not
mind
doing
again
was
surprised
to
know
that
i
was
walking
and
tried
to
persuade
me
to
take
a
chair
but
i
flew
in
the
face
of
it
all
these
good
people
certainly
impressed
me
but
i
decided
to
run
the
gauntlet
and
take
the
risk
the
question
of
face
is
always
merely
one
of
theory
never
of
fact
and
the
principles
that
govern
face
and
its
attainment
were
wholly
beyond
my
apprehension
i
shall
probably
be
more
concerned
in
saving
my
life
than
in
saving
my
face
i
thought
therefore
it
was
that
when
i
reached
a
place
called
i
discarded
all
superfluities
of
dress
and
strode
forward
just
at
that
time
in
the
early
morning
when
the
sun
was
gilding
the
dewdrops
on
the
hedgerows
with
a
grandeur
which
breathed
encouragement
to
the
traveler
in
a
flannel
shirt
and
flannel
pants
a
terrible
breach
of
foreign
etiquette
no
doubt
but
very
comfortable
to
one
who
was
facing
the
first
eighty
li
he
had
ever
walked
on
china
soil
my
three
coolies
the
typical
chinese
coolie
of
but
very
good
fellows
with
all
their
faults
were
to
land
me
at
miles
distant
some
li
in
seven
days
time
they
were
to
receive
four
hundred
cash
per
man
per
day
were
to
find
themselves
and
if
i
reached
within
the
specified
time
i
agreed
to
them
to
the
extent
of
an
extra
thousand
f
they
carried
according
to
the
arrangement
ninety
catties
apiece
and
their
rate
of
pay
i
did
not
consider
excessive
until
i
found
that
each
man
sublet
his
contract
for
a
fourth
of
his
pay
and
trotted
along
and
merry
at
my
side
then
i
regretted
that
i
had
not
thought
twice
before
closing
with
them
it
is
probable
that
the
solidity
of
the
great
paved
highways
of
china
have
been
exaggerated
i
have
not
been
on
the
north
china
highways
but
have
had
considerable
experience
of
them
in
western
china
and
particularly
and
have
very
little
praise
to
lavish
upon
them
certain
it
is
that
the
road
to
does
not
deserve
the
nice
things
said
about
it
by
various
travelers
the
whole
route
from
to
paved
with
flagstones
varying
in
width
from
three
to
six
or
seven
feet
the
only
main
road
of
course
is
creditably
regular
in
some
places
whilst
other
portions
especially
over
the
mountains
are
extremely
bad
and
uneven
in
some
places
i
could
hardly
get
along
at
all
and
my
boy
would
call
out
as
he
came
along
in
his
chair
behind
me
master
i
thinkee
you
makee
catch
two
piecee
men
makee
carry
this
no
proper
road
you
makee
bad
feet
come
and
truly
my
feet
were
shamefully
blistered
one
had
to
step
from
stone
to
stone
with
considerable
agility
in
places
bridges
had
fallen
in
nobody
had
attempted
to
put
them
into
a
decent
state
of
repair
though
this
is
never
done
in
china
and
one
of
the
features
of
every
day
was
the
wonderful
fashion
in
which
the
mountain
ponies
picked
their
way
over
the
broken
route
they
are
as
as
goats
as
i
gazed
admiringly
along
the
miles
and
miles
of
ripening
wheat
and
golden
rape
beans
interspersed
everywhere
with
the
inevitable
poppy
swaying
gently
as
in
a
sea
of
all
the
dainty
colors
of
the
rainbow
i
did
not
wonder
that
had
been
called
the
garden
of
china
greater
or
denser
cultivation
i
had
never
seen
the
hills
smiled
joyously
in
the
first
gentle
touches
of
spring
and
enriching
green
each
terrace
being
irrigated
from
the
one
below
by
a
small
stream
of
water
regulated
in
the
most
primitive
manner
the
windlass
driven
by
man
power
and
not
a
square
inch
lost
even
the
mud
banks
dividing
these
fertile
areas
are
made
to
yield
on
the
sides
cabbages
and
lettuces
and
on
the
tops
wheat
and
poppy
there
are
no
fences
you
see
before
you
a
forest
of
mountains
made
a
dark
leaden
color
by
thick
mists
from
out
of
which
gradually
come
the
pictures
of
green
and
purple
and
brown
and
yellow
and
gold
which
roll
hither
and
thither
under
a
cloudy
sky
in
indescribable
confusion
the
chain
may
commence
in
the
south
or
the
north
in
two
or
three
soft
undulations
which
trend
away
from
you
and
form
a
vapory
background
to
the
landscape
from
these
i
see
such
a
picture
even
as
i
write
seated
on
the
stone
steps
in
the
middle
of
a
mountain
path
at
once
united
and
peculiarly
distinct
rise
five
masses
with
rugged
crests
rough
and
cut
into
shady
hollows
on
the
sides
a
faint
pale
aureola
from
the
sun
on
the
mists
rising
over
the
summits
and
sharp
outlines
looking
to
the
north
an
immense
curved
line
shows
itself
growing
ever
greater
opening
like
the
arch
of
a
gigantic
bridge
and
binding
this
first
group
to
a
second
more
complicated
each
peak
of
which
has
a
form
of
its
own
and
does
in
some
sort
as
it
pleases
without
troubling
itself
about
its
neighbor
the
most
remarkable
point
about
these
mountains
is
the
life
they
seem
to
possess
it
is
an
incredible
confusion
angles
are
thrown
fantastically
by
some
mad
geometer
it
would
seem
splendid
banyan
trees
shelter
one
after
toiling
up
the
unending
steps
and
dotted
over
the
landscape
indiscriminately
in
magnificent
picturesqueness
are
pretty
farmhouses
nestling
almost
out
of
sight
in
groves
of
sacred
trees
oftentimes
perpendicular
mountains
stand
sheer
up
for
three
thousand
feet
or
more
their
sides
to
the
very
summits
ablaze
with
color
coming
from
the
smiling
face
of
sunny
nature
in
spots
at
times
where
only
a
cultivation
is
possible
a
dome
raises
its
head
curiously
over
the
leaning
shoulder
of
a
round
hill
and
a
pyramid
reverses
itself
as
if
to
the
music
of
some
wild
orchestra
whose
symphonies
are
heard
in
the
mountain
winds
seen
nearer
and
in
detail
these
mountains
are
all
in
delicious
keeping
with
all
of
what
the
imagination
in
love
with
the
fantastic
attracted
by
their
more
distant
forms
could
dream
valleys
gorges
somber
gaps
walls
cut
perpendicularly
rough
or
polished
by
water
cavities
festooned
with
hanging
stalactites
and
notched
like
gothic
sculptures
all
make
up
a
strange
sight
which
can
not
but
excite
admiration
every
mile
or
so
there
are
and
for
a
couple
of
cash
a
coolie
can
get
a
cup
of
tea
with
leaves
sufficient
to
make
a
dozen
cups
and
as
much
boiling
water
as
he
wants
the
country
its
people
their
ways
and
methods
and
much
information
thereto
appertaining
is
already
in
print
it
were
useless
to
give
more
of
it
here
and
reader
you
will
thank
me
but
the
thirst
of
that
thirst
which
is
unique
in
the
whole
of
the
empire
and
eclipsed
nowhere
on
the
face
of
the
earth
except
perhaps
on
the
sahara
one
does
not
hear
about
many
an
englishman
would
give
much
for
the
chinese
coolie
thirst
so
very
very
much
i
wonder
whether
you
reader
were
ever
thirsty
probably
not
you
get
a
thirst
which
is
not
insatiable
yours
is
born
of
nothing
extraordinary
yours
can
be
satisfied
by
a
gulp
or
two
of
water
or
perhaps
by
a
drink
or
perhaps
two
or
perhaps
three
of
something
stronger
the
chinese
coolie
thirst
arises
from
the
grilling
sun
from
a
dancing
glare
from
hard
hauling
struggling
with
pounds
slung
over
his
shoulders
dangling
at
the
end
of
a
bamboo
pole
i
have
had
this
thirst
of
the
chinese
coolie
i
know
it
well
it
is
born
of
sheer
heat
and
sheer
perspiration
every
drop
of
liquid
has
been
wrung
out
of
my
body
i
have
seemed
to
have
swum
in
my
clothes
and
inside
my
muscles
have
seemed
to
shrink
to
dry
sponge
and
my
bones
to
dry
pith
my
substance
my
strength
my
self
has
drained
out
of
me
i
have
been
conscious
of
perpetual
evaporation
and
liquefaction
and
i
have
felt
that
i
must
stop
and
wet
myself
again
i
really
wet
myself
and
swell
to
life
again
and
here
we
sit
at
the
people
come
and
stare
at
me
and
wonder
what
it
is
they
too
are
thirsty
for
they
are
all
coolies
and
have
the
coolie
thirst
i
wet
myself
i
pour
in
cup
after
cup
and
my
body
my
self
sucks
it
in
draws
it
in
as
if
it
were
the
water
of
life
instantly
it
gushes
out
again
at
every
pore
i
swill
in
more
and
out
it
rushes
again
madly
rushes
out
as
quickly
as
it
can
i
swill
in
more
and
more
and
out
it
comes
defiantly
i
can
keep
none
inside
me
useless
i
quench
my
thirst
at
last
the
thirst
thinks
its
conquest
assured
taking
the
hot
tea
for
a
signal
of
surrender
but
i
pour
in
more
and
gradually
feel
the
tea
settling
within
me
i
am
a
degree
less
torrid
a
shade
more
substantial
and
then
here
comes
my
boy
master
you
wantchee
makee
one
drink
no
can
catchee
soda
this
side
have
got
water
can
do
ah
shall
i
shall
i
no
i
throw
it
away
from
me
fling
a
bottle
of
cheap
brandy
which
he
had
bought
for
me
at
away
from
me
and
the
boy
looks
forlorn
tea
is
the
best
of
all
drinks
in
china
for
the
traveler
unquestionably
the
best
good
in
the
morning
good
at
midday
good
in
the
evening
good
at
night
even
after
the
day
toil
has
been
forgotten
i
shall
have
more
walking
more
thirsting
more
tea
china
tea
thou
art
a
godsend
to
the
wayfarer
in
that
great
land
i
endeavored
to
get
the
details
of
the
population
of
the
province
of
the
variability
of
the
reports
providing
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
uncertainty
impending
over
everything
statistical
in
china
estimates
ranged
from
to
eighty
millions
the
surface
of
this
province
is
made
up
of
masses
of
rugged
mountains
through
which
the
yangtze
has
cut
its
deep
and
narrow
channel
the
area
is
everywhere
intersected
by
valleys
and
ravines
the
plain
of
the
capital
is
the
only
plain
of
any
size
in
the
province
the
system
of
irrigation
employed
on
it
being
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
every
food
crop
flourishes
in
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
products
of
the
chinese
pharmacopoeia
enrich
the
stores
and
destroy
the
stomachs
of
the
and
with
the
exception
of
cotton
all
that
grows
in
eastern
china
grows
better
in
this
great
garden
of
the
empire
its
area
is
about
that
of
france
its
climate
is
even
superior
a
land
delightfully
among
the
minerals
found
are
gold
silver
cinnabar
copper
iron
coal
and
petroleum
the
chief
products
being
opium
white
wax
hemp
yellow
silk
is
a
province
rich
in
salt
obtained
from
artesian
borings
some
of
which
extend
feet
below
the
surface
and
from
which
for
centuries
the
brine
has
been
laboriously
raised
by
antiquated
windlass
and
water
buffalo
the
best
conditions
of
chinese
inns
are
far
and
away
worse
than
anything
the
traveler
would
be
called
upon
to
encounter
anywhere
in
the
british
isles
even
in
the
most
isolated
places
in
rural
ireland
there
can
be
no
comparison
and
my
reader
will
understand
that
there
is
much
which
the
european
misses
in
the
way
of
general
physical
comfort
and
cleanliness
sanitation
is
absent
ordinary
decency
forbids
one
putting
into
print
what
the
uninitiated
traveler
most
desires
to
know
if
he
would
be
saved
a
severe
shock
at
the
outset
but
everyone
has
to
go
through
it
because
one
can
not
write
what
one
sees
all
travelers
who
have
had
to
put
up
at
the
caravanseries
in
central
and
western
china
will
bear
me
out
in
my
assertion
that
all
of
them
reek
with
filth
and
are
overrun
by
vermin
of
every
description
the
traveler
whom
misfortune
has
led
to
travel
off
the
main
roads
of
russia
may
probably
hesitate
in
expressing
an
opinion
as
to
which
country
carries
off
the
palm
for
unmitigated
filth
but
with
this
exception
travelers
in
the
eastern
archipelago
in
central
asia
in
africa
among
the
wildest
tribes
are
pretty
well
unanimous
that
compared
with
all
these
for
dirt
disease
discomfort
an
utter
lack
of
decency
and
annoyance
the
chinese
inn
holds
its
own
and
in
no
part
of
china
more
than
in
and
is
greater
discomfort
experienced
the
usual
wooden
bedstead
stands
in
the
corner
of
the
room
with
the
straw
bedding
this
by
the
way
should
on
no
account
be
removed
if
one
wishes
to
sleep
in
peace
sometimes
there
is
a
table
sometimes
a
couple
of
chairs
if
these
are
steady
it
is
lucky
if
unbroken
it
is
the
exception
there
are
never
more
over
the
bedstead
more
often
than
not
by
the
way
it
is
composed
of
four
planks
of
varying
lengths
and
thickness
placed
across
two
trestles
i
used
first
to
place
my
oilskin
then
my
and
that
little
creeper
which
rhymes
with
hug
did
not
disturb
me
much
rats
ran
round
and
over
me
in
profusion
and
of
course
the
best
room
being
invariably
nearest
to
the
pigsties
there
were
the
usual
stenches
the
floor
was
mother
earth
which
in
wet
weather
became
mud
and
quite
a
common
thing
it
was
for
my
joys
to
be
enhanced
during
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
by
my
having
to
sleep
almost
suffocated
mackintosh
over
my
head
owing
to
a
slight
break
in
the
continuity
of
the
roof
my
umbrella
being
unavailable
as
one
of
my
men
dropped
it
over
a
precipice
two
days
out
for
many
reasons
a
is
to
europeans
an
indispensable
part
of
even
the
most
modest
traveling
equipment
i
was
many
times
sorry
that
i
had
none
with
me
the
inns
of
however
are
by
many
degrees
better
than
those
of
which
are
sometimes
indescribable
earthen
floors
are
saturated
with
damp

else
who
can
describe

it
makes
one
ill
to
think
of
it
throughout
my
journeyings
it
was
necessary
for
my
toileting
in
fact
everything
to
be
performed
in
absolute
unalloyed
publicity
three
days
out
my
boy
fixed
up
a
cold
bath
for
me
and
barricaded
a
room
which
had
a
certain
amount
of
privacy
about
it
owing
to
its
secluded
position
but
even
grown
men
and
women
anxious
to
see
what
was
like
when
it
had
no
clothes
on
came
forward
poked
their
fingers
through
the
paper
in
the
windows
of
course
glass
is
hardly
known
in
the
interior
and
greedily
peeped
in
this
and
the
profound
curiosity
the
people
evince
in
one
every
action
and
movement
i
found
most
trying
it
was
my
misfortune
each
day
at
this
stage
to
come
into
a
town
or
village
where
market
was
in
progress
catching
a
sight
of
the
foreign
visage
people
opened
their
eyes
widely
turned
from
me
faced
me
again
with
a
little
less
of
fear
and
then
came
to
me
not
in
dozens
but
in
hundreds
with
open
arms
they
shouted
and
made
signs
and
walking
excitedly
by
my
side
they
examined
at
will
the
texture
of
my
clothes
and
touched
my
boots
with
sticks
to
see
whether
the
feet
were
encased
or
not
for
the
time
i
was
their
hero
when
i
walked
into
an
inn
business
brightened
immediately
tea
was
at
a
premium
and
only
the
richer
class
could
afford
nine
cash
instead
of
three
to
drink
tea
with
the
bewildered
foreigner
the
most
inquisitive
came
behind
me
rubbing
their
unshaven
pates
against
the
side
of
my
head
in
enterprising
endeavor
to
see
through
the
sides
of
my
spectacles
they
would
speak
to
me
yelling
in
their
coarsest
tones
thinking
my
hearing
was
defective
i
would
motion
then
to
go
away
always
politely
cleverly
suppressing
my
sense
of
indignation
at
their
conduct
and
they
would
do
so
only
to
make
room
for
a
worse
crowd
the
town
business
stopped
people
left
their
stalls
and
shops
to
glare
aimlessly
at
or
to
ask
inane
and
unintelligible
questions
about
the
barbarian
who
seemed
to
have
dropped
suddenly
from
the
heavens
when
i
addressed
a
few
words
to
them
in
strongest
telling
them
in
the
name
of
all
they
held
sacred
to
go
away
and
leave
me
in
peace
something
like
a
cheer
would
go
up
and
my
boy
would
swear
them
all
down
in
his
choicest
when
i
slowly
rose
to
move
the
crowd
looked
disappointed
but
allowed
me
to
go
forward
on
my
journey
in
peace
thus
the
days
passed
and
things
were
never
dull

the

of

lofty

high
up
from

in
the
cleft
of
cañons
everywhere
that
the
careless
lover
is
not
admitted
to
her
contemplation
it
is
for
such
that
china
holds
out
an
inviting
hand
but
she
offers
little
else
to
the
westerner
the
student
of
nature
and
of
man
can
alone
be
happy
in
the
interior
forgetting
time
and
the
life
of
my
own
world
i
sometimes
come
to
inviolate
stillnesses
where
nature
opens
her
arms
and
bewitchingly
promises
embraces
in
soft
unending
undulating
vastnesses
where
even
the
watching
of
a
bird
building
its
nest
or
brooding
over
its
young
or
some
little
groundling
at
its
gracious
play
seems
to
hold
one
charmed
beyond
description
it
is
some
may
say
a
nomadic
life
yes
it
is
a
nomadic
life
but
how
beautiful
to
those
of
us
and
there
are
many
who
love
less
the
comforts
of
our
own
small
life
than
the
entrancing
wonders
of
the
world
in
spots
where
nothing
has
changed
gladly
did
i
quit
the
dust
and
din
of
western
life
the
artificialities
of
dress
and
the
unnumbered
futile
affectations
of
our
own
maybe
not
misnamed
civilization
to
go
and
breathe
freely
and
peacefully
in
those
nooks
of
the
silent
where
solitude
was
broken
only
by
the
lulling
or
the
roaring
of
the
winds
of
heaven
thank
god
there
are
these
uninvaded
corners
the
realm
of
silence
is
after
all
vaster
than
the
realm
of
noise
and
the
fact
brought
a
consolation
as
one
watched
nature
effecting
a
sort
of
coquetry
in
masking
her
operations
and
as
i
look
upon
it
all
i
wonder
wonder
whether
with
the
opening
of
china
this
must
all
change
the
chinese
i
refer
to
the
chinese
of
interior
provinces
such
as
are
realizing
that
they
hold
an
obscure
position
i
have
heard
educated
chinese
remark
that
they
look
upon
themselves
as
lost
like
shipwrecked
sailors
whom
a
night
of
tempest
has
cast
on
some
lonely
rock
and
now
they
are
having
recourse
to
cries
volleys
all
the
signals
imaginable
to
let
it
be
known
that
they
are
still
there
they
have
been
on
this
lonely
isolated
rock
as
far
as
history
can
trace
now
they
are
launching
out
towards
progress
towards
the
making
of
things
towards
the
buying
and
selling
of
things
launching
out
in
trade
and
in
commerce
in
politics
in
literature
in
science
in
all
that
has
spelt
advance
in
the
west
the
modern
spirit
is
spreading
speedily
into
the
domains
of
life
everywhere
in
places
swiftly
in
places
slowly
but
spreading
inevitably
sit
nothing
will
tend
in
this
particular
part
of
the
country
to
turn
it
upside
down
and
inside
out
more
than
the
cult
of
industrialism
in
a
number
of
centers
in
eastern
china
such
as
and
shanghai
foreign
mills
iron
works
and
so
on
furnish
new
employments
but
in
the
interior
the
machine
of
the
west
to
the
uneducated
celestial
seems
to
be
the
foe
of
his
own
tools
and
when
railways
and
steam
craft
appear
steam
has
appeared
of
course
on
the
upper
yangtze
although
it
has
not
yet
taken
much
of
the
junk
trade
and
has
her
railways
now
under
construction
the
sod
was
cut
at
ichang
in
g
and
a
single
train
and
steamer
does
the
work
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
carters
coolies
and
boatmen
it
is
wholly
natural
that
their
imperfect
and
views
should
lead
them
to
rise
against
a
seeming
new
peril
whilst
in
the
end
the
empire
will
profit
greatly
by
the
inventions
of
the
occident
the
period
of
transition
in
especially
if
machines
are
introduced
too
rapidly
and
unwisely
is
one
that
will
disturb
the
peace
it
will
be
interesting
to
watch
the
attitude
of
the
people
towards
the
railway
for
is
essentially
the
province
of
the
farmer
was
one
of
the
provinces
where
concessions
were
demanded
and
railways
had
been
planned
by
european
syndicates
and
where
the
gentry
and
students
held
mass
meetings
feverishly
declaring
that
none
shall
build
chinese
lines
but
the
people
themselves
i
have
no
space
in
a
work
of
this
nature
to
go
fully
into
the
question
of
industrialism
railways
and
other
matters
immediately
vital
to
the
interests
of
china
but
if
the
peace
of
china
is
to
be
maintained
it
is
incumbent
upon
every
foreigner
to
go
slowly
machines
of
foreign
make
have
before
now
been
scrapped
railways
have
been
pulled
up
and
thrown
into
the
sea
telegraph
lines
have
been
torn
down
and
sold
and
on
every
hand
among
this
wonderful
people
there
has
always
been
apparent
a
distinct
hatred
to
things
and
ideas
foreign
but
industrially
particularly
the
benefits
of
the
west
are
being
recognized
in
eastern
china
and
gradually
if
foreigners
who
have
to
do
the
pioneering
are
tactful
trust
in
the
machine
will
spread
to
western
china
and
enlarged
industrialism
will
bring
advantages
to
western
trade
thus
far
there
has
been
little
shifting
of
the
population
from
hamlets
and
villages
to
centers
of
new
industries
even
in
the
more
forward
areas
quoted
but
when
this
process
begins
new
elements
will
enter
into
the
chinese
industrial
problem
as
we
hear
of
the
new
china
so
is
there
a
new
people
a
people
emboldened
by
the
examples
of
officials
in
certain
areas
to
show
a
friendliness
towards
progress
and
innovation
they
were
not
friendly
a
decade
ago
it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
this
new
people
were
born
after
the
boxer
troubles
and
in
they
have
a
large
influence
cotton
mills
silk
filatures
flour
and
rice
mills
employing
western
machinery
modern
mining
plants
and
other
evidences
of
how
china
is
coming
out
of
her
shell
cause
one
to
rejoice
in
improved
conditions
the
animosity
occasioned
by
these
inventions
that
are
being
so
gradually
and
so
surely
introduced
into
every
nook
and
cranny
of
east
and
north
china
is
very
marked
but
on
close
inspection
and
after
one
has
made
a
study
of
the
subject
one
is
inclined
to
feel
that
it
is
more
or
less
theoretical
so
it
is
to
be
hoped
it
will
be
in
and
far
western
china
readers
may
wonder
at
the
differences
of
opinions
expressed
in
the
course
of
these
pages
a
hundred
pages
on
one
may
get
a
totally
different
impression
but
the
absolute
differences
of
conditions
existing
are
quite
as
remarkable
from
to
one
breathed
an
air
of
progress
after
one
had
made
allowance
for
the
antagonistic
circumstances
under
which
china
lives
a
manifest
desire
on
every
hand
for
things
foreign
and
a
most
lively
and
intelligent
interest
in
what
the
foreigner
could
bring
in
many
parts
of
again
conditions
were
completely
reversed
and
one
finding
himself
in
after
having
lived
for
some
time
at
a
port
in
the
east
of
the
empire
would
assuredly
find
himself
surrounded
by
everything
antagonistic
to
that
to
which
he
has
become
accustomed
and
the
people
would
seem
of
a
different
race
this
may
be
due
to
the
differences
of
climate
climate
indeed
is
ultimately
the
first
and
the
last
word
in
the
east
it
is
the
arbiter
the
builder
the
disintegrator
of
everything
a
leading
writer
on
eastern
affairs
says
that
the
climate
is
the
explanation
of
all
this
history
of
asia
and
the
peoples
of
the
east
can
only
be
understood
and
accounted
for
by
the
measuring
of
the
heat
of
the
sun
rays
in
china
with
climate
and
weather
charts
in
your
hands
you
may
travel
from
the
red
river
on
the
frontier
to
the
great
sungari
in
lusty
manchuria
and
be
able
to
understand
and
account
for
everything
however
that
may
be
traveling
in
china
through
a
wonderful
province
like
whose
chief
entrepôt
is
fifteen
hundred
miles
from
the
coast
convinces
one
that
she
has
come
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
you
can
in
any
city
or
village
in
or
in
for
that
matter
in
a
lesser
degree
always
find
the
new
nationalism
in
the
form
of
the
new
china
student
despite
the
opposition
he
gets
from
the
old
school
and
although
the
old
order
of
things
by
being
so
strong
as
almost
to
overwhelm
him
allows
him
to
make
less
progress
than
he
would
this
new
student
the
hope
of
the
empire
is
there
i
do
not
wish
to
enter
into
a
controversy
on
this
subject
but
i
should
like
to
quote
the
following
from
a
speech
delivered
by
tseh
hsüan
when
he
was
leaving
his
post
as
governor
of
the
officials
of
china
are
gradually
acquiring
a
knowledge
of
the
great
principles
of
the
religions
of
europe
and
america
and
the
churches
are
also
laboring
night
and
day
to
readjust
their
methods
and
to
make
known
their
aims
in
their
propagation
of
religion
consequently
chinese
and
foreigners
are
coming
more
and
more
into
cordial
relations
this
fills
me
with
joy
and
hopefulness
my
hope
is
that
the
teachers
of
both
countries
great
britain
and
america
will
spread
the
gospel
more
wisely
than
ever
that
hatred
may
be
banished
and
disputes
dispelled
and
that
the
influence
of
the
gospel
may
create
boundless
happiness
for
my
people
of
china
and
i
shall
not
be
the
only
one
to
thank
you
for
coming
to
the
front
in
this
good
work
may
the
gospel
prosper
there
are
various
grades
of
people
in
china
among
which
the
scholar
has
always
come
first
because
mind
is
superior
to
wealth
and
it
is
the
intellect
that
distinguishes
man
above
the
lower
order
of
beings
and
enables
him
to
provide
food
and
raiment
and
shelter
for
himself
and
for
others
at
the
time
when
europe
was
thrilled
and
cut
to
the
quick
with
news
of
the
massacres
of
her
compatriots
in
the
boxer
revolts
the
scholar
was
a
dull
stupid
fellow

in
month
out
and
year
after
year
he
ground
at
his
classics
his
classics
were
the
and
he
worshipped
them
this
era
has
now
passed
away
at
the
present
moment
there
are
upwards
of
twenty
thousand
chinese
students
in
tokyo
h
whither
they
went
because
japan
is
the
most
convenient
country
wherein
to
acquire
western
knowledge
the
new
learning
the
new
learning
they
have
the
new
learning
no
high
office
is
ever
again
likely
to
be
given
but
to
him
who
has
more
of
western
knowledge
than
chinese
knowledge
and
mere
striplings
nursed
in
the
lap
of
the
mission
schools
and
there
given
a
good
grounding
in
western
education
these
are
the
men
far
more
likely
to
pass
the
new
examinations
in
where
little
chance
exists
for
the
scholars
to
advance
the
new
learning
has
brought
with
it
a
revolutionary
element
which
would
soon
become
dangerous
were
it
by
any
means
common
i
have
seen
an
fellow
anxious
to
get
on
and
under
the
impression
that
the
laws
of
his
country
were
responsible
for
keeping
him
back
write
in
the
back
of
his
exercise
book
a
phrase
against
the
imperial
ruler
that
would
have
cost
him
his
head
had
it
come
to
the
notice
of
the
high
authorities
one
will
learn
much
if
he
travels
across
the
empire
facts
and
figures
quite
irreconcilable
will
arise
but
even
the
man
of
dullest
perception
will
be
convinced
that
much
of
the
reforming
spirit
in
the
people
is
only
going
no
farther
than
the
externals
of
life
it
is
at
present
perhaps
merely
a
mad
fermentation
in
the
western
provinces
wherefrom
the
fiercer
it
is
the
clearer
the
product
will
one
day
evolve
itself
such
transitions
are
full
of
bewilderment
to
the
european
bewildering
to
any
writer
who
endeavors
to
tackle
the
empire
as
a
whole
each
province
or
couple
of
provinces
should
be
dealt
with
separately
so
diverse
are
the
conditions
but
if
china
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
will
only
embrace
truth
and
love
her
for
her
own
sake
so
that
she
will
not
abate
one
jot
of
allegiance
to
her
if
china
will
let
truth
run
down
through
the
arteries
of
everyday
commercial
social
and
political
life
as
do
the
waterways
through
her
marvelous
country
if
china
will
kill
her
retardative
conservatism
and
in
its
place
erect
honesty
and
conscience
if
china
will
let
her
moral
life
be
quickened
then
her
transition
period
from
end
to
end
of
the
empire
will
soon
end
mineral
agricultural
industrial
wealth
are
hers
to
a
degree
which
is
not
true
of
any
other
land
her
people
have
an
enduring
and
expansive
power
that
has
stood
the
test
of
more
than
four
thousand
years
of
honorable
history
and
their
activity
and
efficiency
outside
china
make
them
more
to
be
dreaded
as
competitors
than
any
race
or
any
dozen
races
of
but
new
china
must
have
this
new
life
commerce
science
diplomacy
culture
civilization
she
will
have
in
measure
just
in
so
much
as
she
draws
nearer
to
western
peoples
but
the
new
life
can
come
from
whence
from
within
or
from
without
luchow
into
which
i
was
led
just
before
noon
on
the
fourth
day
out
of
is
the
most
populous
and
richest
city
on
the
upper
yangtze
exceedingly
clean
for
a
chinese
city
possessing
streets
lined
with
emporiums
bearing
every
evidence
of
commercial
prosperity
it
however
lacks
one
thing
it
has
no
hotel
runners
i
arrived
at
midday
crossing
the
river
in
a
leaky
ferry
boat
under
a
blazing
sun
my
intention
being
to
stop
in
the
town
at
a
to
take
a
refresher
and
then
complete
a
long
day
march
farther
than
the
ordinary
stage
but
owing
to
some
misunderstanding
between
the
sent
to
shadow
the
foreigner
on
part
of
his
journey
and
my
boy
i
was
led
through
the
busy
city
out
into
the
open
country
before
i
had
had
a
drink
and
when
i
remonstrated
they
led
me
back
again
to
the
best
inn
where
i
was
told
i
should
have
to
spend
the
night
there
being
nothing
else
then
to
be
said
may
i
give
a
word
of
advice
here
to
any
reader
contemplating
a
visit
to
china
under
similar
conditions
it
is
the
custom
of
the
mandarins
to
send
what
is
called
a
escort
for
you
the
escort
comes
from
the
military
although
their
peculiar
appearance
may
lead
you
to
doubt
it
i
have
two
of
these
soldier
people
with
me
and
two
bigger
ragamuffins
it
has
not
been
my
lot
to
cast
eyes
on
they
are
the
only
two
men
in
the
crowd
i
am
afraid
of
they
are
of
absolutely
no
use
more
than
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
always
come
up
smiling
at
the
end
of
their
stage
for
their
during
the
whole
of
this
day
i
have
not
seen
one
of
them
they
have
been
behind
the
caravan
all
the
time
it
would
be
hard
to
believe
that
they
had
sense
enough
to
find
the
way
and
as
for
escorting
me
they
have
not
accompanied
me
a
single
li
of
the
way
i
another
nuisance
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
is
the
necessity
of
taking
a
chair
to
maintain
respectability
these
things
make
travel
in
china
not
so
cheap
as
one
would
be
led
to
imagine
traveling
of
itself
is
cheap
enough
as
cheap
as
in
any
country
in
the
world
for
accommodation
for
myself
for
a
room
rice
and
as
much
hot
water
as
i
want
the
charge
is
a
couple
of
hundred
cash
certainly
not
expensive
in
addition
there
is
generally
a
little
cha
tsien
tea
money
for
the
cook
but
it
is
the
face
which
makes
away
with
money
much
more
than
it
takes
to
keep
you
in
the
luxury
that
the
country
can
offer
which
is
not
much
after
i
had
had
a
bit
of
a
discussion
with
my
boy
as
to
the
room
they
wanted
to
house
me
in
a
woman
brandishing
a
huge
cabbage
stump
above
her
head
and
looking
menacingly
at
me
yelled
that
the
room
was
good
enough
what
does
she
say
oh
she
all
same
fool
she
wantchee
makee
talkee
talk
she
have
got
velly
long
tongue
makee
bad
woman
she
say
one
piecee
japan
man
makee
stay
here
night
see
she
say
what
makee
good
one
piecee
japan
man
makee
good
one
piecee
english
man
see
no
have
got
topside
all
same
bottomside
have
got
master
this
no
my
pidgin
this
woman
pidgin
and
woman
all
same
fool
ended
up
with
an
amusing
allusion
to
the
lady
mother
and
looked
cross
because
i
rebuked
him
gathering
then
that
the
lady
thought
her
room
good
enough
for
me
i
saw
no
other
course
open
and
as
the
crowd
was
gathering
i
got
inside
before
setting
out
to
call
upon
the
canadian
missionaries
stationed
at
the
place
i
held
a
long
conversation
with
a
old
man
an
unsightly
mass
of
disease
who
seemed
to
be
a
traditional
link
of
luchow
i
might
say
that
this
scholastic
old
wag
spoke
nothing
but
chinese
and
i
as
the
reader
knows
spoke
no
chinese
so
that
the
amount
of
general
knowledge
derived
one
from
the
other
was
therefore
limited
but
he
would
not
go
despite
the
frequent
deprecations
of
and
my
coolies
and
my
vehement
rhetoric
in
explanation
that
his
presence
was
distasteful
to
me
and
at
the
end
of
the
episode
i
found
it
imperative
for
my
own
safety
and
perhaps
his
to
clear
out
the
canadians
i
found
in
their
premises
comfortable
albeit
five
of
them
were
resident
at
the
time
and
they
were
quite
pleased
with
the
work
they
had
done
during
the
last
year
or
so
most
of
them
were
new
to
china
at
the
china
inland
mission
later
i
found
two
young
scotsmen
getting
some
exercise
by
throwing
a
cricket
ball
at
a
stone
wall
in
a
compound
about
twenty
feet
square
they
were
glad
to
see
me
one
of
them
kindly
gave
me
a
and
at
their
invitation
i
stayed
the
night
with
them
what
is
it
in
the
nature
of
the
chinese
which
makes
them
appear
to
be
so
totally
oblivious
to
the
best
they
see
in
their
own
country
it
is
surely
not
because
they
are
not
as
sensitive
as
other
races
to
the
magic
of
beauty
in
either
nature
or
art
but
i
found
traveling
and
living
with
such
apparently
unsympathetic
creatures
exasperating
to
a
degree
and
i
did
not
wonder
that
the
european
whose
lot
had
been
cast
in
the
interior
sometimes
on
emerging
into
western
civilization
appears
eccentric
to
his
own
countrymen
but
this
in
passing
i
duly
arrived
at
and
was
told
that
li
away
would
be
reached
the
next
day
although
i
had
my
doubts
a
deputation
from
the
local
gwan
waited
upon
me
to
learn
my
wishes
and
to
receive
my
commands
i
was
assured
that
no
european
ever
walked
to
from
and
that
if
i
attempted
to
do
such
a
thing
i
should
have
to
go
alone
and
that
i
should
never
reach
there
i
remonstrated
but
my
boy
was
firm
he
took
me
to
him
and
fathered
me
he
almost
cried
over
me
to
think
that
i
that
i
his
master
of
all
people
in
the
world
should
doubt
his
allegiance
to
me
i
no
he
declared
master
no
savee
velly
big
place
have
got
plenty
european
you
wantchee
makee
go
fast
catchee
plenty
good
i
think
you
catchee
one
piecee
boat
makee
go
up
the
river
i
think
you
have
got
velly
tired
no
wantchee
makee
more
walkee
that
no
ploper
that
all
same
fool
pidgin
and
at
last
i
melted
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
that
no
one
ever
walked
to
from
this
place
the
district
potentate
assured
me
in
a
private
chit
which
i
could
not
read
when
he
laid
his
gunboat
at
my
disposal
this
he
said
would
take
me
up
very
quickly
in
his
second
note
wherein
he
apologized
that
indisposition
kept
him
from
calling
personally
upon
me
this
of
course
was
a
lie
he
said
he
would
feel
it
an
honor
if
i
would
be
pleased
to
accept
the
use
of
his
contemptible
boat
but
whispered
that
the
law
uses
these
terms
in
china
and
that
nobody
would
be
more
disappointed
than
the
chinese
magistrate
if
i
take
advantage
of
his
unmeaning
offer
so
i
took
a
and
the
following
night
when
pulling
into
the
shadows
of
the
pagoda
cold
and
hungry
i
cursed
my
luck
that
i
had
not
broken
down
the
useless
etiquette
which
these
chinese
officials
extend
towards
foreigners
and
taken
the
fellow
gunboat
the
they
swore
to
me
would
be
ready
to
leave
at
the
day
following
my
boy
did
not
venture
to
sleep
at
all
he
stayed
up
outside
my
bedroom
door
i
say
bedroom
but
actually
it
was
an
apartment
which
in
europe
i
would
not
put
a
horse
into
and
the
door
was
merely
a
wide
board
placed
on
end
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
heard
a
noise
yea
a
rattle
the
said
board
fell
down
inwards
almost
upon
me
a
light
was
flashed
swiftly
into
my
eyes
and
desultory
remarks
which
suddenly
escaped
me
were
rudely
interrupted
by
shrill
screams
my
boy
was
singing
master
he
cried
pulling
at
my
left
big
toe
to
wake
me
come
on
come
on
you
wantchee
makee
get
up
have
got
two
get
up
me
no
wakee
you
no
makee
sleep
no
ploper
one
man
makee
go
bottomside
have
catchee
boat
this
morning
no
have
got
tea
no
can
catch
hot
water
makee
boil
and
soon
we
were
ready
to
start
punctually
to
the
appointed
hour
we
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
steep
dark
incline
leading
down
to
the
river
bank
but
my
reckonings
were
bad
the
and
the
other
two
youthful
members
of
the
crew
had
not
yet
taken
their
chow
and
this
added
to
many
little
discrepancies
in
their
reckoning
and
in
mine
kept
me
in
a
boiling
rage
until
six
when
at
last
they
pushed
off
and
nearly
capsized
the
boat
at
the
outset
the
details
of
that
early
morning
and
the
happenings
throughout
the
long
sad
day
i
think
i
can
never
forget
from
the
breaking
of
to
frequent
stranding
on
the
rocks
and
sticking
on
sandbanks
the
orders
wrongly
given
the
narrow
escape
of
fire
on
board
the
bland
of
the
ass
of
a
captain
the
collisions
and
all
the
most
profound
examples
of
savage
ignorance
displayed
when
one
has
foolish
chinese
to
deal
with
we
reached
at
with
sixty
li
to
do
against
a
wind
hour
after
hour
they
toiled
making
little
headway
with
their
misdirected
labor
wasting
their
energies
in
doing
the
right
things
at
the
wrong
time
and
wrong
things
always
and
long
after
sundown
pagoda
loomed
in
the
distance
at
stiff
and
hungry
and
mad
with
rage
i
was
groping
my
way
on
all
fours
up
the
slippery
steps
through
unspeakable
slime
and
filth
at
the
quayhead
only
to
be
led
to
a
disgusting
inn
as
dirty
as
anything
i
had
yet
encountered
it
was
hard
lines
for
i
could
get
no
food
an
invitation
however
was
given
me
by
the
rev
mcintyre
who
with
his
charming
wife
conducts
the
china
inland
mission
in
this
city
to
come
and
stay
with
them
the
next
morning
after
a
sleepless
night
of
twisting
and
turning
on
a
bed
i
was
glad
to
take
advantage
of
the
missionary
kindness
i
could
not
have
been
given
a
kindlier
welcome
has
a
population
of
roughly
and
the
overcrowding
question
is
not
the
least
important
it
is
situated
to
advantage
on
the
right
bank
of
the
yangtze
and
does
an
immense
trade
in
medicines
opium
silk
furs
silverwork
and
white
wax
which
are
the
chief
exports
gunboats
regularly
come
to
during
the
heavy
rains
just
outside
the
city
a
large
area
is
taken
up
with
grave
mounds
common
with
nearly
every
chinese
city
mcintyre
and
herbert
who
was
passing
through
for
where
he
is
now
working
showed
me
around
the
city
one
afternoon
and
one
could
see
everything
typical
of
the
social
life
of
two
thousand
years
ago
the
same
narrow
lanes
succeed
each
other
and
the
conviction
is
gradually
impressed
upon
the
mind
that
such
is
the
general
trend
of
the
character
of
the
city
and
its
people
there
were
the
same
busy
mechanics
barbers
traders
wayside
cooks
traveling
and
lusty
coolies
the
wag
doctor
the
bane
of
the
gullible
was
there
to
drive
his
iniquitous
living
now
and
then
the
scene
monotony
was
disturbed
by
the
presence
of
the
chair
and
the
retinue
of
a
city
mandarin
yet
with
all
the
hurry
and
din
the
hurrying
and
the
scurrying
in
doing
and
driving
for
making
money
seldom
was
there
an
accident
or
interruption
of
good
nature
there
was
the
same
romance
in
the
streets
that
one
reads
of
at
school
so
much
alike
and
yet
so
different
from
what
one
meets
in
the
chinese
places
at
the
coast
or
in
or
singapore
in
more
than
in
any
other
town
in
western
china
which
i
visited
had
the
native
artist
seemed
to
have
lavished
his
ingenuity
on
the
street
signboards
their
caligraphy
gave
the
most
humorous
intimation
of
the
superiority
of
the
wares
on
sale
many
of
them
contained
some
fictitious
emblem
adopted
as
the
name
of
the
shop
similar
to
the
practice
adopted
in
london
two
centuries
ago
and
so
common
now
in
the
straits
settlements
where
bankrupts
are
allowed
considerable
more
freedom
than
would
be
possible
if
fictitious
registration
were
not
allowed

the
registration

g
i
inspected
the
railway
at
ichang
in
december
and
found
that
a
remarkable
scheme
was
making
very
creditable
progress
around
the
main
station
centre
there
was
an
air
of
bustle
and
excitement
some
coolies
were
in
employment
there
all
the
buildings
and
equipment
bore
evidences
of
thoroughness
and
the
scheme
seemed
to
be
going
on
well
but
in
january
of
this
year
a
meeting
was
held
at
the
proposed
destination
of

line
and
the
gentry
then
decided
that
as
nothing
was
being
done
at
that
end
the
company
should
be
requested
to
stop
work
at
ichang
and
start
laying
the
line
from
at
the
other
end
all
the
money
will
be
spent
they
cried
and
we
shall
get
nothing
up
this
end
if
the
money
ran
out
and
left
the
central
portion
of
the
line
incomplete
it
did
not
matter
so
long
as
each
city
had
something
for
its
money

the

my
experience
of
that

fourth
journey
to

of
and

to

tribute
to
the

the

li
in
a

of
traveling
nearly
cuts
his

scene
at
dying
manacled
by

do
not
work
he
who
would
make
most
abundant
excuses
for
the
chinese
could
not
say
that
he
is
simple
in
his
speech
that
speech
is
the
chief
revelation
of
the
mind
the
first
visible
form
that
it
takes
is
undoubtedly
true
as
the
thought
so
the
speech
all
social
relations
with
us
have
their
roots
in
mutual
trust
and
this
trust
is
maintained
by
each
man
sincerity
of
thought
and
speech
apparently
not
so
in
china
there
is
so
much
craft
so
much
diplomacy
so
much
subtle
legerdemain
that
if
he
chooses
the
chinese
may
give
you
no
end
of
trouble
to
inform
yourself
on
the
simplest
subject
the
chinese
like
so
many
cavillers
and
calumniators
all
glib
of
tongue
who
know
better
than
any
nation
on
earth
how
to
turn
voice
and
pen
to
account
have
taken
the
utmost
advantage
of
extended
means
of
circulating
thought
with
the
result
that
an
englishman
such
as
myself
even
were
i
a
deep
scholar
of
their
language
would
have
the
greatest
difficulty
in
getting
at
the
truth
about
their
own
affairs
as
i
was
going
out
of
my
caravan
and
myself
were
delayed
by
some
fellow
who
held
the
attention
of
my
men
for
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
i
listened
understanding
nothing
after
another
five
minutes
by
which
time
the
conversation
had
assumed
what
i
considered
dangerous
proportions
having
the
safety
of
my
boy
at
heart
i
asked
what
is
it
half
a
he
replied
having
learnt
this
phrase
from
the
gunboat
men
down
the
river
he
did
not
however
take
his
eyes
from
the
man
with
whom
he
was
holding
the
conversation
he
then
dived
into
my
wrenched
off
the
top
of
a
tin
and
pulled
therefrom
two
live
pigeons
which
flapped
their
wings
helplessly
to
get
away
and
resumed
the
conversation
talk
waxed
furious
the
birds
were
placed
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
now
white
with
seeming
rage
threatened
to
hit
the
man
it
turned
out
that
the
plaintiff
was
the
seller
of
the
birds
and
that
had
got
them
too
cheap
that
man
no
savee
he
thinkee
you

have
got
plenty
money
he
all

rogue
i
no

i
know

as
the
cover
of

closed
down
i
noticed
a

two
live
pheasants
with
their
legs
tied
together
a
pair
of
my
own
muddy
boots
a
pair
of
dancing
pumps

a
dirty
collar
all
in

if

fond

fantastic
salutations
to
the
disappointed
vendor
of
pigeons
and
moved
backwards
on
tiptoe
till
he
could
see
him
no
more
then
we
went
noiselessly
down
a
steep
incline
out
into
an
open

dishevelled
beauty
on

the
reports
i
heard
about
being
overtaken
by

rather
disquieting

no

eliminating

with

the

should
not
mentally
reduce
this
to
english
miles
for
the
march
was
more
like
fifty
miles
than
thirty
if
we
consider
the
physical
exertion
required
to
scale
the
treacherous
roads
over
a
broad
zigzagging
road
said
to
have
no
less
than
curves
from
bottom
to
top
we
ascend
for
thirty
li
and
then
descend
for
the
remainder
of
the
journey
through
a
narrow
defile
along
the
northern
bank
of
the
river
the
opposite
side
being
a
vertical
sheet
of
rock
rising
to
at
least
a
thousand
feet
sheer
up
very
similar
to
the
gorges
of
the
mekong
at
the
western
end
of
the
province
which
i
crossed
in
due
course
to
high
up
on
the
mountain
banks
the
first

is
by
the
river
at
the
place
a
fearful
ascent
is
experienced
the
most
notable
precipice
on
the
route
between
and
up
a
broad
zigzag
path
and
as
i
sat
at
dinner
i
could
see
neither
top
nor
bottom
owing
to
the
overhanging
masses
of
rock
this
is
after
having
negotiated
an
ascent
quite
as
steep
but
smaller
to
a
few
natural
obstacles
occur
although
the
road
is
always
high
up
on
the
i
crossed
a
miserable
suspension
bridge
of
two
spans
the
southern
span
is
about
thirty
feet
the
northern
span
eighty
feet
the
center
is
supported
by
a
buttress
of
splendid
blocks
of
squared
stone
resting
on
the
rock
in
the
bed
of
the
river
one
side
being
considerably
worn
away
by
the
action
of
the
water
the
longer
span
was
hung
very
slack
the
woodwork
forming
the
pathway
was
not
too
safe
and
the
general
shaky
appearance
was
particularly
uninviting
from
to
wuchai
is
steady
pulling
once
in
an
opening
in
the
hill
we
passed
along
and
then
ascended
an
exceedingly
steep
spur
on
one
side
of
a
narrow
and
very
deep
natural
amphitheatre
formed
by
surrounding
mountains
we
then
came
to
a
lagoon
and
eventually
the
brow
of
the
hill
was
reached
thus
the
wuchai
valley
is
arrived
at
where
owing
to
a
collection
of
water
the
road
is
often
impassable
to
man
and
beast
often
during
the
rainy
season
there
is
a
lagoon
of
mud
or
water
formed
by
the
drainage
from
the
mountains
which
finds
no
escape
but
by
percolating
through
the
earth
and
rock
to
a
valley
on
the
east
of
and
below
the
mountains
forming
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
wuchai
valley
to
is
fairly
level
going
considering
the
road
it
was
not
unnatural
that
my
men
gibbed
a
little
at
the
accomplishment
i
had
a
long
parley
with
them
however
and
agreed
to
reward
them
to
the
extent
of
one
thousand
cash
among
the
three
if
they
did
it
their
pay
for
the
journey
over
admittedly
some
of
the
worst
roads
in
the
empire
was
to
be
four
hundred
cash
per
man
as
before
with
three
hundred
and
cash
extra
if
the
rain
did
not
prevent
them
from
getting
in
in
eleven
days
they
were
in
good
spirits
and
so
was
i
as
we
walked
along
the
where
the
poppy
was
to
be
seen
in
full
flower
and
the
unending
beds
of
rape
alternated
with
peas
and
beans
and
tobacco
would
persist
in
stealing
the
peas
and
beans
to
feed
me
on
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
get
him
to
see
that
he
should
not
do
this
sort
of
thing
but
how
continually
one
was
impressed
with
the
great
need
of
roads
in
western
china
it
is
natural
that
walking
the
whole
distance
i
should
notice
this
more
than
other
travelers
have
done
and
to
my
mind
roads
in
this
part
of
the
country
rank
in
importance
before
the
railways
to
the
foreign
mind
it
is
more
to
the
interests
of
china
that
railways
should
be
well
and
serviceably
built
than
that
the
money
should
be
squandered
to
no
purpose
if
the
railway
has
rails
then
in
china
it
can
be
called
a
railway
and
china
is
satisfied
so
with
the
roads
if
there
is
any
passage
at
all
then
the
chinese
call
it
a
road
and
china
is
satisfied
as
one
meanders
through
the
country
watching
a
people
who
are
equalled
nowhere
in
the
world
for
their
industry
plodding
away
over
the
worst
roads
any
civilized
country
possesses
he
can
not
but
think
even
looking
at
the
question
from
the
chinese
standpoint
so
far
as
he
is
able
that
were
free
scope
once
given
for
the
infusion
of
western
energy
and
methods
into
an
active
people
like
the
chinese
china
would
rival
the
united
states
in
wealth
and
natural
resources
the
chinese
knows
that
his
country
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
and
the
people
will
allow
him
to
do
things
on
a
scale
which
will
by
and
by
completely
overbalance
the
doings
of
countries
less
favored
by
nature
than
his
own
he
knows
that
when
properly
developed
his
country
will
be
one
of
the
richest
in
the
world
yet
even
when
he
is
filled
with
such
ideas
he
is
just
as
cunctative
as
he
has
ever
been
he
has
the
idea
that
he
should
not
commence
to
exhaust
the
wealth
of
his
country
before
it
is
absolutely
necessary
above
all
he
has
now
made
up
his
mind
that
he
himself
unaided
by
the
foreigner
is
going
to
develop
it
just
as
he
likes
and
just
when
he
likes
the
day
of
the
foreign
concession
is
gone
the
chinese
now
is
paddling
his
own
canoe
and
it
is
only
by
cultivating
his
friendship
by
proving
to
him
by
acts
and
not
by
words
that
the
intrusion
of
privileged
enterprises
such
as
great
mining
concessions
and
railway
concessions
in
which
the
foreigner
demands
that
he
be
the
only
principal
is
no
longer
contemplated
that
the
day
will
be
won
but
it
is
equally
true
that
only
by
combining
european
and
chinese
interests
on
the
modern
company
system
the
real
opening
of
china
can
be
effected
distances
are
as
variable
as
the
wind
in
the
middle
kingdom
the
first
forty
li
on
this
journey
were
much
shorter
than
the
last
thirty
which
took
about
twice
as
long
to
cover
i
dragged
along
over
the
narrow
path
through
the
wheat
fields
and
making
for
an
old
man
who
looked
as
if
he
should
know
i
asked
him
the
distance
to
my
destination
his
reply
of
twenty
li
i
accepted
as
accurate
and
i
reckoned
that
i
could
cover
this
easily
in
a
couple
of
hours
but
at
the
end
of
this
time
we
had
according
to
a
casual
wayfarer
five
more
li
and
when
we
had
covered
at
least
four
another
rustic
said
it
was
two
and
a
bit
this
answer
we
got
from
four
different
people
on
the
way
and
i
was
glad
when
i
had
completed
the
journey
one
does
not
mind
the
two
li
so
much
it
is
the
bit
which
upsets
one
calculations
the
following
day
on
the
road
to
i
lost
myself
that
is
i
lost
my
men
and
did
not
know
the
road
i
got
away
into
some
quaint
secluded
garden
and
sat
down
tired
and
hot
under
a
tree
in
the
shade
where
a
faint
wind
swung
the
heavy
foliage
with
a
solemn
sound
and
the
subdued
and
soothing
music
of
a
brook
running
between
two
banks
of
moss
and
turf
must
have
sent
me
to
sleep
it
was
with
a
dreary
sense
of
ominous
foreboding
that
i
woke
as
if
in
expectation
of
some
disaster
not
a
living
creature
was
visible
and
i
doubted
the
possibility
of
finding
anyone
in
such
a
spot
never
surely
was
there
a
silence
anywhere
as
here
seized
with
a
solemn
fear
my
presence
there
seemed
to
me
a
strange
intrusion
i
looked
around
moved
forward
a
little
hastened
my
steps
to
get
away
but
whence
or
how
i
knew
not
i
knew
this
was
a
country
of
erratic
distances
it
was
now
getting
on
for
sunset
and
the
continuous
toiling
up
and
down
the
sides
of
the
difficult
mountains
had
tired
me
all
of
a
sudden
i
heard
a
noise
heard
someone
fall
looked
round
and
beheld
perspiration
pouring
down
his
back
and
front
oh
master
this
velly
much
bobbery
i
makee
velly
frightened
i
think
master
wantchee
makee
run
away
and
then
after
a
time
you
no
wantchee
catch
chow
no
i
could
easily
have
gone
without
food
for
that
night
i
was
lost
and
now
was
found
i
had
no
money
could
not
speak
the
language
was
fatigued
beyond
words
what
would
have
become
of
me
miniature
hills
hemmed
us
in
as
in
a
huge
park
with
a
narrow
winding
pathway
steep
as
the
side
of
a
house
leading
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
beyond
and
then
descending
quite
as
rapidly
to
the
coolies
told
me
the
next
day
the
road
would
be
worse
and
so
it
turned
out
to
be
at
a
thick
drizzly
rain
was
falling
just
sufficient
to
make
the
flagstones
slippery
as
ice
and
the
european
contrivances
which
covered
my
feet
stood
no
chance
at
all
compared
with
the
straw
sandals
of
the
native
i
could
not
get
any
big
enough
around
here
to
put
over
my
boots
my
carriers
had
gone
ahead
and
as
i
was
passing
a
paddy
field
one
leg
went
from
under
me
and
i
was
up
to
my
middle
in
thin
wet
mud
in
this
i
had
to
trudge
seven
miles
before
i
could
get
other
garments
from
the
coolie
changing
my
trousers
behind
a
piece
of
matting
held
up
in
front
of
me
by
my
boy
all
enjoyed
the
fun
except
myself
little
boys
tried
to
peer
around
the
side
of
the
matting
and
as
tried
to
kick
them
away
the
matting
would
drop
and
expose
me
to
public
view
but
i
had
to
change
and
that
was
most
important
to
me
later
on
my
ugly
coolie
the
ugliest
man
in
or
out
of
china
i
should
think
ugly
beyond
description
dropped
my
bedding
as
he
was
crossing
the
river
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
sleeping
on
a
wet
bed
at
i
must
ask
the
reader
pardon
for
again
referring
to
chinese
inns
i
should
not
have
made
any
remark
upon
this
awful
hovel
had
not
the
man
laid
a
scheme
to
charge
me
three
times
as
much
as
he
should
a
scheme
be
it
said
in
which
my
boy
took
no
part
it
was
truly
a
fearful
den
where
man
and
beast
lived
in
promiscuous
and
insupportable
filth
the
charms
the
sight
of
this
agricultural
people
without
in
the
slightest
wounding
their
olfactory
nerves
and
these
utilitarians
think
there
is
no
use
seeking
privacy
to
do
what
they
regard
as
beneficial
and
productive
work
the
bed
here
was
the
worst
i
had
had
offered
me
the
mattress
upon
which
every
previous
traveler
for
many
years
had
left
his
tribute
of
vermin
was
not
fit
for
use
there
were
myriads
of
filthy
insects
and
i
found
myself
obliged
to
stop
and
have
some
clothes
boiled
and
for
comfort
sake
rubbed
my
body
with
chinese
wine
filth
there
was
everywhere
it
seemed
inseparable
from
the
people
and
a
total
apathy
as
regards
matter
in
the
wrong
place
pervaded
all
classes
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
the
spring
is
opening
and
my
coolies
doff
their
heavy
padded
winter
clothing
parade
their
naked
skin
and
are
quite
unconscious
of
any
disgrace
attending
the
exhibition
of
the
itch
sores
which
disfigure
them
i
remember
however
that
i
am
in
china
and
must
not
be
disgusted
and
should
any
reader
be
disgusted
at
the
disjointed
character
of
this
particular
portion
of
my
common
chronicle
i
would
only
say
in
apology
that
i
am
writing
under
the
gaze
of
a
mystified
crowd
each
of
whom
has
a
word
to
say
about
my
typewriter
the
first
undoubtedly
that
he
has
ever
seen
this
machine
has
caused
the
greatest
surprise
all
along
the
route
and
it
is
on
occasions
when
the
chinese
sees
for
the
first
time
things
of
this
intimate
mechanical
nature
that
he
gives
one
the
impression
that
he
is
a
little
boy
the
people
crowd
into
my
room
they
can
not
be
kept
out
although
at
the
present
moment
i
have
stationed
my
two
soldiers
in
the
doorway
where
i
am
writing
so
as
to
get
a
little
light
to
keep
them
from
crowding
actually
upon
me
it
has
been
said
that
all
of
us
have
an
innermost
room
wherein
we
conceal
our
own
secret
affairs
in
china
everything
is
so
open
and
so
much
must
be
done
in
public
that
it
would
surprise
one
to
know
that
the
chinese
have
an
inner
room
the
european
traveler
in
this
region
must
have
no
inner
room
either
for
the
people
seem
to
see
down
deep
into
one
very
soul
but
it
is
when
one
wanders
on
alone
as
i
have
done
doing
two
days
in
one
no
less
than
one
hundred
and
forty
li
of
terrible
road
through
the
most
isolated
country
that
one
can
enjoy
the
comfort
of
one
own
loneliness
and
own
inner
room
the
scenery
was
picturesque
much
like
scotland
but
the
solitude
was
the
best
of
all
i
had
left
office
and
books
and
manuscripts
and
was
on
a
lonely
walk
enjoying
a
solitude
from
which
i
could
not
escape
a
reverie
which
was
passed
not
nearly
so
much
in
thinking
as
in
feeling
a
feeling
to
which
can
never
be
completely
expressed
in
words
it
was
indeed
a
refuge
from
the
storms
of
life
and
a
veritable
chamber
of
peace
and
this
to
my
mind
is
the
way
to
spend
a
holiday
robert
louis
stevenson
tells
us
in
one
of
his
early
books
what
a
complete
world
two
congenial
friends
make
for
themselves
in
the
midst
of
a
foreign
population
all
the
hum
and
the
stir
goes
on
and
these
two
strangers
exchange
glances
and
are
filled
with
an
infinite
content
some
of
us
would
rather
be
alone
perhaps
for
on
a
trip
such
as
i
am
making
now
in
order
to
be
happy
with
a
companion
you
must
have
one
who
is
thoroughly
congenial
and
sympathetic
one
who
understands
your
unspoken
thought
who
is
willing
to
let
you
have
your
way
on
the
concession
of
the
same
privilege
selfishness
in
the
slightest
degree
should
not
enter
in
but
such
a
man
is
difficult
to
find
so
i
wander
on
alone
happy
in
my
own
solitude
here
i
have
liberty
perfect
liberty
i
was
stopped
on
my
way
to
at
a
small
town
called
the
first
place
of
importance
after
having
come
into
a
few
li
before
reaching
this
town
one
of
my
men
cut
the
large
toe
of
his
left
foot
on
a
sharp
rock
lacerating
the
flesh
to
the
bone
i
attended
to
him
as
best
i
could
on
the
road
paid
him
four
days
extra
pay
and
then
had
a
bit
of
a
row
with
him
because
he
would
not
go
back
he
avowed
that
carrying
for
the
foreigner
was
such
a
good
thing
that
he
feared
leaving
it
upon
entering
however
he
fell
in
the
roadway
a
crowd
gathered
a
loud
cry
went
up
from
the
multitude
and
in
the
consternation
and
confusion
which
ensued
the
people
divided
themselves
into
various
sections
some
rushed
to
proffer
assistance
to
the
fallen
man
this
was
done
because
i
was
about
he
would
have
been
left
had
a
foreigner
not
been
there
others
gathered
around
me
with
outrageous
adulation
and
seeming
words
of
welcome
meanwhile
i
thought
the
coolie
was
dying
and
fearful
and
unnatural
as
it
seems
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
at
all
ages
the
chinese
find
a
peculiar
and
awful
satisfaction
in
watching
the
agonies
of
the
dying
by
far
the
larger
part
of
the
mob
was
watching
him
dying
as
they
thought
but
no
he
was
still
worth
many
dead
men
he
slowly
opened
his
eyes
smiled
rose
up
and
immediately
recognized
a
poor
manacled
wretch
then
passing
under
escort
of
several
soldiers
who
stopped
a
little
farther
down
followed
by
a
mandarin
in
a
chair
on
this
particular
day
more
than
a
customary
morbid
diversion
was
thus
apparent
among
the
mass
of
men
and
women
and
the
ignominious
way
in
which
that
prisoner
was
treated
was
horrible
to
look
upon
the
perpetual
hum
of
voices
sounded
like
the
noise
made
by
a
thousand
swarming
bees
the
band
of
soldiers
guarding
the
prisoner
suddenly
halted
whilst
the
mandarin
conferred
with
the
chief
after
which
he
advanced
slowly
towards
me
i
was
on
the
point
of
telling
him
in
english
that
i
had
done
nothing
against
the
law
so
far
as
i
knew
he
bowed
solemnly
during
which
time
i
attempting
the
same
had
much
trouble
from
bursting
out
laughing
in
his
face
he
beckoned
to
me
and
then
rushed
me
bodily
into
a
house
where
in
the
best
room
i
found
another
official
and
his
two
sons
followed
as
interpreter
the
mandarin
explained
that
i
was
wanted
to
stay
the
night
that
a
theatrical
entertainment
had
been
arranged
particularly
for
my
benefit
that
he
wished
i
would
take
their
photographs
that
one
of
them
would
like
a
cigarette
tin
with
some
cigarettes
in
it
and
that
one
of
them
would
like
to
sell
me
a
thoroughbred
black
pony
which
they
would
part
with
for
my
benefit
for
the
consideration
of
one
hundred
taels
down
four
times
its
value
which
awaited
my
inspection
without
i
stood
up
and
fronted
them
and
replied
through
that
i
could
not
stay
the
night
that
i
would
be
pleased
to
tolerate
the
howling
of
the
theatre
for
one
half
of
an
hour
that
it
would
have
given
me
the
greatest
pleasure
to
take
their
photographs
but
alas
my
films
were
not
many
i
handed
them
a
cigarette
tin
but
quite
forgot
that
they
asked
for
cigarettes
as
well
i
had
none
and
i
explained
that
was
not
one
of
my
accomplishments
so
that
their
quadruped
would
be
of
no
use
to
me
they
looked
glum
i
smiled
serenely
this

were
one
uninformed
small
observance
would
be
necessary
to
detect
the
borderline
of
and
the
latter
is
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
most
and
desolate
provinces
of
the
empire
mountainous
void
of
cultivation
when
compared
with
one
mass
of
high
hills
conditioned
now
as
nature
made
them
and
the
people
too
ashamed
of
their
own
wretchedness
are
and
the
greater
part
of
the
roads
to
be
traversed
now
were
constructed
on
projecting
slopes
above
rivers
and
torrents
affluents
of
the
yangtze
and
cross
a
region
upon
which
the
troubled
appearance
of
the
mountains
that
bristle
over
it
stamps
the
impress
of
a
severe
kind
of
beauty
such
roads
would
not
be
tolerated
in
any
country
but
china
i
doubt
if
any
but
the
ancient
chinese
could
have
had
the
patience
to
build
them
one
could
not
walk
with
comfort
it
was
an
impossible
task
far
away
over
the
earth
winding
into
all
the
natural
trends
of
the
mountain
base
ran
the
highway
merrily
tripping
over
huge
boulders
into
hollows
and
out
of
them
almost
underground
but
always
with
its
long
white
extended
finger
beckoning
me
on
by
the
narrow
ribbon
in
the
distance
true
although
i
was
absolutely
destitute
of
company
i
had
always
the
road
with
me
yet
ever
far
from
me
i
could
not
catch
it
up
and
sometimes
dreaming
triumphantly
that
i
had
now
come
even
with
it
where
it
seemed
to
end
in
some
disordered
stony
mass
it
would
trip
mischievously
out
again
into
view
bounding
away
into
some
tricky
bend
far
down
to
the
edge
of
the
river
and
rounding
out
of
sight
once
more
until
the
point
of
vantage
was
attained
its
twisting
and
turning
up
and
down
inwards
outwards
made
humor
for
the
full
long
day
with
it
i
could
not
quarrel
for
it
did
its
best
to
help
me
with
my
weary
men
onwards
over
the
now
darkened
landscape
and
ever
took
the
lead
to
urge
us
forward
if
it
came
to
a
great
upstanding
mountain
with
marked
politeness
it
ran
round
by
a
circuitous
route
more
easily
if
of
greater
length
at
other
times
it
scaled
clear
up
nimbly
and
straight
turning
not
once
to
us
in
its
task
and
at
the
top
standing
like
some
fairy
on
a
beckoned
us
on
encouragingly
at
times
it
became
exhausted
and
stretched
itself
wearisomely
out
measuring
in
width
to
only
a
few
small
inches
and
overlooked
the
river
at
great
height
telling
us
to
ponder
well
our
footsteps
ere
we
go
forward
to
part
company
with
the
road
would
mean
to
die
for
elsewhere
was
no
foothold
possible
so
in
this
narrow
faithful
ledge
torn
up
by
the
heavy
tread
of
countless
horses
feet
beyond
where
horse
traffic
starts
we
carefully
ordered
every
step
looking
down
sheer
down
as
from
some
lofty
palace
window
i
saw
the
green
snake
waiting
waiting
for
me
slipping
there
would
be
no
hope
death
and
the
river
alone
lay
down
that
treacherous
and
then
at
times
pursuing
that
wriggling
demon
which
stretched
out
far
over
the
landscape
in
incessant
writhing
and
annoying
contortions
we
quite
gave
up
the
chase
it
seemed
leading
me
on
to
some
unknown
destiny
i
knew
not
whither
only
this
i
knew
that
i
must
follow
and
so
each
hour
and
every
hour
was
fraught
with
peril
which
seemed
imminent
but
he
who
guards
the
fatherless
and
helpless
feeds
the
poor
and
friendless
guarded
the
traveler
in
those
days
mishaps
i
had
none
and
when
at
night
i
reached
those
tiny
mountain
seats
perched
majestically
high
for
the
most
part
and
swept
by
all
the
winds
of
heaven
i
seemed
to
be
the
lonely
spectator
and
companionless
watcher
over
mighty
which
appeared
every
moment
to
be
hesitating
to
take
a
gigantic
dive
into
the
roaring
river
several
hundred
feet
below
our
lofty
some
of
the
larger
villages
had
the
arrogant
look
of
old
feudal
fortresses
and
up
the
paths
leading
to
them
cut
out
in
a
defile
in
the
vertical
cliffs
we
passed
with
difficulty
coolies
carrying
on
their
backs
the
enormous
loads
which
are
the
wonder
of
all
who
have
seen
them
their
backs
straining
under
the
frames
to
which
the
merchandise
was
lashed
hundreds
passed
us
on
their
toilsome
journey
with
tea
skins
hides
copper
lead
coal
and
white
wax
from
and
with
salt
english
cotton
chinese
porcelain
fans
and
so
on
from
one
false
step
one
slight
slip
and
they
would
have
been
hurled
down
the
ravine
where
far
below
in
the
roaring
cataract
dwarfed
to
the
size
of
a
toy
boat
was
a
junk
being
cleverly
taken
and
down
there
also
one
false
move
and
the
huge
junk
would
have
been
dashed
against
the
rocks
and
banks
strewn
with
the
corpses
of
the
crew
as
it
was
they
were
mere
specks
of
blue
in
a
background
of
white
foam
their
vociferating
and
yelling
being
drowned
by
the
roar
of
the
waters
on
the
road
passing
and
i
saw
coolies
on
the
way
to
with
german
cartridges
and
japanese
guns
the
packing
so
different
generally
to
british
goods
which
come
into
china
being
particularly
good
this
is
one
of
the
cries
of
the
importer
in
china
against
the
british
manufacturer
and
if
the
latter
knew
more
of
chinese
transport
and
the
manner
in
which
the
goods
are
handled
in
changing
from
place
to
place
one
would
meet
fewer
broken
packages
on
the
road
in
this
land
of
long
distances
a
friend
of
mine
needing
a
typewriter
wrote
home
explicit
instructions
as
to
the
packing
pack
it
ready
to
ship
he
wrote
then
take
it
to
the
top
of
your
office
stairs
throw
it
down
the
stairs
take
machine
out
and
inspect
and
if
it
is
undamaged
and
send
to
me
if
damaged
pack
another
machine
subject
to
the
same
treatment
until
you
are
convinced
that
it
can
stand
being
thus
handled
and
escape
injury
this
is
how
goods
coming
to
western
china
should
be
sent
away
gradually
the
days
brought
harder
toil
the
mountains
grew
higher
some
covered
with
forests
of
pine
trees
which
natural
ornament
completely
changed
the
aspect
of
the
country
torrents
foamed
noisily
down
the
gorges
veiled
by
the
curtain
of
great
trees
sometimes
on
a
ridge
a
field
of
buckwheat
shining
in
the
sun
looked
like
the
beginning
of
the
eternal
snows
food
was
at
famine
rates
eggs
there
were
in
abundance
pork
also
but
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
traveler
having
seen
the
conditions
under
which
the
pigs
are
reared
refrained
from
the
luxury
of
roast
pig
my
men
fed
on
maize
the
faces
of
the
people
were
pinched
and
wan
unpleasant
to
look
upon
bearing
unmistakable
signs
of
poverty
and
misery
and
they
seemed
too
concerned
in
keeping
the
wolf
from
the
door
to
attend
to
me
at
they
treated
themselves
to
a
of
rice
apiece
here
the
is
catties
as
against
catties
in
the
capital
of
the
province
at
wuchai
the
last
stage
before
reaching
the
room
of
the
inn
had
three
walls
only
and
two
of
these
were
composed
of
kerosene
tins
laced
together
with
bamboo
stripping
probably
the
oil
tins
had
been
stolen
from
the
mission
premises
at
through
the
whole
night
it
rained
as
it
had
never
rained
before
but
instead
of
feeling
miserable
i
tried
to
see
the
humor
of
the
situation
one
can
get
humor
from
the
most
embarrassing
circumstances
and
my
chief
amusement
arose
from
a
small
business
deal
between
one
of
my
coolies
who
had
sublet
his
contract
to
a
poor
fellow
returning
in
the
rain
who
had
arranged
to
carry
the
ninety
catties
ninety
li
for
a
fourth
of
the
original
price
arranged
between
my
coolie
and
myself
for
one
full
hour
they
argued
at
a
terrible
speed
as
to
the
rate
of
exchange
in
the
large
and
the
small
cash
and
this
was
only
interrupted
when
a
poor
man
deaf
and
dumb
and
of
hideous
appearance
seeing
the
foreigner
in
his
contemptible
town
rushed
in
with
a
carrying
pole
and
felled
his
grumbling
townsman
at
my
feet
my
intervention
probably
averted
murder
at
any
rate
it
seemed
as
though
murder
would
have
taken
place
very
soon
but
for
my
interference
the
whole
populace
gathered
of
course
and
the
fight
waged
fiercely
until
well
on
into
the
night
but
wrapping
myself
in
my
mackintosh
and
putting
my
paper
umbrella
at
the
right
angle
i
went
to
sleep
with
the
rain
dripping
on
me
as
they
were
indulging
in
final
pleasantries
regarding
each
other
ancestry
the
first
thing
i
saw
at
the
next
day
was
the
foreign
cigarette
sold
at
a
wayside
stall
by
a
vendor
of
monkey
nuts
and
marrow
seeds
no
trade
has
prospered
in
during
the
past
two
years
more
than
the
foreign
cigarette
trade
and
the
growing
evil
among
the
children
of
the
common
people
both
male
and
female
is
viewed
with
alarm
from
to
mengtsz
from
to
bhamo
one
is
rarely
out
of
sight
of
the
flaring
posters
in
the
chinese
characters
advertising
the
british
cigarette
some
months
ago
a
couple
of
europeans
were
sent
out
to
advertise
and
they
stuck
their
poster
decorations
on
the
walls
of
temples
on
private
houses
and
official
residences
with
the
result
that
the
people
were
piqued
so
much
as
to
tear
down
the
bills
immediately
in
especially
since
the
exit
of
opium
this
common
cigarette
is
smoked
by
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
i
have
been
offered
them
at
small
feasts
and
when
calling
upon
high
officials
at
the
capital
have
been
offered
a
packet
of
cigarettes
instead
of
a
whiff
of
opium
as
would
have
been
done
formerly
one
is
not
of
course
prepared
to
say
whether
such
a
trade
is
desirable
or
not
but
it
merely
needs
to
be
made
known
that
towards
the
middle
of
the
present
year
a
proclamation
was
issued
from
the
viceroy
at
speaking
in
strongest
terms
against
the
increasing
habit
of
smoking
foreign
cigarettes
to
show
the
trend
of
official
opinion
on
the
subject
after
having
referred
to
the
enormous
advances
made
in
the
imports
of
cigarettes
the
proclamation
deplored
the
general
tendency
of
the
people
to
support
such
an
undesirable
trade
and
exhorted
the
citizens
to
turn
from
their
evil
ways
we
can
not
stop
the
importation
of
cigarettes
it
read
but
there
is
no
need
for
our
people
to
buy
at
i
stayed
with
the
rev
savin
and
spent
a
very
pleasant
two
days
rest
here
in
his
hospitable
hands
it
was
in
this
district
i
first
came
across
goitre
the
first
time
i
had
seen
it
in
my
life
it
is
a
terrible
disfigurement
poor
indeed
is
the
whole
of
this
neighborhood
poverty
thin
and
wanting
food
to
eat
stalks
abroad
dressed
in
a
rag
or
two
armed
with
a
staff
to
keep
away
the
snarling
dogs
and
a
broken
bowl
to
gather
garbage
even
the
better
class
who
manage
to
afford
their
maize
and
bean
curds
are
to
be
praised
for
the
extreme
simplicity
which
everywhere
vividly
marks
their
monotonous
lives
indeed
this
is
true
of
the
whole
area
through
which
i
have
traveled
no
furniture
brings
confusion
to
their
rooms
no
machinery
distresses
the
ear
with
its
groaning
or
the
eye
with
its
unsightliness
no
factories
belch
out
smoke
and
blacken
the
beauty
of
the
sky
no
trains
screech
to
disturb
sleepers
and
frighten
babies
the
simplest
of
simple
beds
in
most
cases
merely
a
few
boards
with
a
straw
mattress
placed
thereon
the
straw
sandal
on
the
foot
wooden
chopsticks
in
place
of
knives
and
forks
the
small
variety
of
foods
and
of
cooking
utensils
the
simple
homespun
cotton
clothing
much
of
this
finds
favor
in
the
eye
of
the
english
traveler
the
chinese
of
all
orientals
teach
us
how
to
live
without
furniture
without
impedimenta
with
the
least
possible
amount
of
clothing
in
the
case
of
the
poorer
classes
and
i
could
not
fail
to
be
impressed
by
the
advantage
thus
held
by
this
great
nation
in
the
struggle
of
life
it
may
serve
them
in
good
stead
in
the
struggle
of
the
yellow
man
against
the
white
man
to
which
i
refer
at
a
later
period
in
this
book
also
does
it
incidentally
show
up
the
real
character
of
some
of
the
weaknesses
of
our
own
civilization
and
when
one
is
in
china
living
near
the
people
one
is
forced
to
reflect
upon
the
useless
multiplicity
of
our
daily
wants
we
must
have
our
daily
stock
of
bread
and
butter
and
meats
glass
windows
and
fires
hats
white
shirts
and
woolen
underwear
boots
and
shoes
trunks
bags
and
boxes
bedsteads
mattresses
sheets
and
blankets
most
of
which
a
chinese
can
do
without
and
indeed
is
actually
better
off
without
j
this
is
not
true
in
every
class
however
for
whilst
there
is
no
denying
the
charm
of
the
simpler
civilization
many
of
the
chinese
of
and
glory
in
goods
of
foreign
manufacture
no
matter
if
to
them
is
not
disclosed
the
proper
purpose
of
any
particular
article
adopted
rice
will
not
grow
here
in
great
quantities
owing
to
the
scarcity
of
water
therefore
the
people
feed
on
maize
and
are
thankful
to
get
it
is
the
centre
of
a
large
district
devastated
by
recurring
seasons
of
plague
rebellion
and
famine
when
thousands
die
annually
from
starvation
in
the
town
and
on
the
level
uplands
surrounding
it
the
beggars
on
one
occasion
becoming
so
numerous
were
driven
from
the
streets
confined
within
the
walls
of
the
temple
and
grounds
beyond
the
south
gate
and
there
fed
by
common
charity
huddled
together
in
disease
and
rags
and
unspeakable
misery
they
died
in
thousands
and
the
chinese
say
that
of
five
thousand
who
crossed
the
temple
threshold
two
thousand
never
came
out
alive
this
happened
some
twenty
years
ago
the
unfortunate
victims
had
for
their
food
a
rice
porridge
mixed
with
which
was
a
subtance
alleged
to
have
been
lime
the
common
belief
being
that
the
majority
of
those
who
perished
died
from
the
effect
of
poisoning
outside
the
city
boundary
hundreds
of
the
dead
were
flung
into
huge
pits
and
even
now
the
inhabitants
refer
to
the
time
when
children
were
exchanged
for
a
handful
of
rice
or
even
less
during
my
stay
in
this
city
i
heard
on
all
hands
some
of
the
most
stories
of
the
dire
distress
which
like
a
dark
cloud
still
menaces
the
people
some
of
which
are
too
dreadful
for
public
print
but
i
suppose
these
poor
people
are
content
if
they
are
they
possess
a
virtue
which
produces
in
some
measure
at
all
events
all
those
effects
which
the
alchemist
usually
ascribes
to
what
he
calls
the
stone
and
if
their
content
does
not
bring
riches
it
banishes
the
desire
for
them
years
ago
the
people
could
entertain
some
small
hope
of
prosperity
now
and
again
if
the
opium
crop
were
good
money
was
plentiful
but
now
no
opium
is
grown
and
the
people
have
lost
all
hope
of
better
times
and
seem
to
have
sunk
in
many
instances
to
the
lowest
pangs
of
distressful
poverty
k
reader
alarm
not
yourself
i
am
not
here
to
lead
you
into
a
long
harangue
on
opium
it
presents
too
thorny
a
subject
for
me
to
handle
i
am
not
a
partisan
in
the
opium
traffic
my
mission
is
not
essentially
to
denounce
it
i
am
not
impelled
by
an
irresistible
desire
to
investigate
facts
and
put
them
before
you
there
is
practically
no
opium
in
to
talk
about
this
is
absolute
fact
not
a
chinese
fact
but
good
old
british
truth
although
british
truth
when
it
touches
upon
opium
has
been
very
very
perverted
since
we
first
commenced
to
transact
opium
trade
with
this
great
country
with
the
exception
of
one
small
patch
some
ten
miles
away
from
the
main
road
between
and
i
saw
no
poppy
whatever
in
the
province
this
does
not
mean
however
that
no
opium
is
to
be
had
during
the
past
three
weeks
l
no
less
than
five
cases
of
attempted
suicide
by
opium
poisoning
have
come
under
my
personal
notice
in
the
town
in
which
i
am
residing
and
there
have
doubtless
been
fifty
more
which
have
not
if
there
is
no
opium
where
do
the
people
so
easily
secure
it
in
endeavors
to
take
their
lives
upon
the
slightest
provocation
last
year
the
price
of
opium
here
on
the
streets
although
its
sale
was
illegal
was
over
three
tsien
about
the
chinese
ounce
of
prepared
opium
at
the
present
time
in
the
same
city
many
men
would
be
willing
to
do
a
deal
for
any
quantity
you
like
for
less
than
two
tsien
cases
of
smuggling
are
frequent
one
gets
accustomed
to
hear
of
large
quantities
being
smuggled
through
in
most
cunning
ways
and
it
all
goes
to
show
that
the
of
are
not
as
some
of
china
enlightened
statesmen
and
some
of
the
ranting
faddists
of
england
and
america
would
have
us
believe
falling
over
one
another
in
their
zeal
to
free
the
province
from
the
drug
the
other
day
some
men
passed
through
several
towns
on
the
way
to
the
capital
carrying
three
coffins
in
the
first
was
a
corpse
the
other
two
were
packed
with
opium
being
suspected
at
the
first
coffin
was
opened
and
the
carriers
making
as
much
row
as
they
could
because
their
coffin
had
been
burst
open
secured
a
fair
squeeze
to
hold
their
tongues
and
the
second
and
third
coffins
were
passed
unexamined
quite
common
is
it
for
men
to
travel
in
armed
bands
from
the
province
of
traveling
by
night
over
the
mountains
by
and
hiding
by
day
from
any
possible
official
searchers
opium
which
is
and
always
has
been
so
heavily
taxed
does
not
in
general
follow
the
ordinary
trade
routes
on
which
stations
are
numerous
but
is
carried
by
these
armed
bands
over
roads
where
the
native
customs
stations
are
few
and
so
poorly
equipped
as
to
yield
readily
to
superior
force
where
the
men
are
compelled
to
accept
a
composition
much
below
the
official
rate
opium
smoking
is
still
common
in
western
china
among
people
who
can
afford
it
at
the
time
of
the
crusade
against
it
wealthy
people
laid
in
stocks
enough
to
last
them
for
years
and
so
long
as
there
is
smuggling
from
other
provinces
which
do
grow
it
into
those
which
do
not
there
will
be
no
danger
of
the
absolute
extermination
being
carried
successfully
into
effect
in
common
with
the
western
provinces
has
undeservedly
secured
the
credit
for
having
practically
abolished
the
poppy
but
at
the
present
moment
december
she
is
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
with
her
supply
and
that
is
the
reason
why
people
of
are
making
bargains
in
opium
smuggled
over
the
border
much
has
yet
to
be
done
to
prevent
the
growth
of
a
plant
which
has
been
in
china
for
at
least
twelve
centuries
which
has
had
medicinal
uses
for
nine
and
whose
medicinal
properties
have
been
put
in
the
capsule
for
six
is
not
an
easy
matter
far
more
difficult
in
fact
than
the
average
englishman
and
even
those
who
rant
so
much
about
the
whole
business
upon
little
knowledge
can
imagine
opium
has
been
made
in
china
for
four
centuries
and
although
used
then
with
tobacco
has
been
smoked
since
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
m
a
few
years
ago
had
only
two
articles
of
importance
with
which
to
pay
for
extra
provincial
products
consumed
namely
opium
and
tin
the
latter
came
from
a
spot
twenty
miles
from
mengtsz
and
the
value
of
the
output
now
runs
to
approximately
three
million
taels
opium
came
from
all
parts
of
the
province
and
went
in
all
directions
that
portion
sent
to
the
opium
regie
at
tonkin
sometimes
being
close
to
three
thousand
piculs
and
the
quantity
going
by
land
into
china
being
very
much
greater
opium
was
known
at
canton
and
in
in
the
production
was
variously
estimated
at
from
twelve
thousand
to
thousand
piculs
in
it
had
risen
to
approximately
thousand
piculs
and
since
then
to
the
time
of
the
reform
no
less
certainly
than
thirty
thousand
piculs
one
afternoon
in
november
of
the
execution
ground
of
was
the
scene
of
a
remarkably
daring
proceeding
by
the
officials
in
the
campaign
for
the
total
suppression
of
opium
in
the
province
no
less
than
ounces
of
prepared
opium
were
publicly
destroyed
by
fire
in
the
presence
of
an
enormous
crowd
of
people
the
officials
of
the
city
were
present
in
person
and
everywhere
the
event
was
looked
upon
as
the
greatest
public
demonstration
that
the
people
had
ever
seen
the
missionary
of
whom
i
inquired
denied
that
the
infanticide
at
was
very
great
things
must
be
improving
previous
to
my
arrival
at
the
city
i
had
instructed
my
boy
to
make
inquiries
in
the
city
and
to
let
me
know
afterwards
whether
girls
were
still
sold
publicly
have
got
plenty
he
exclaimed
in
describing
this
wholesale
selling
of
female
children
into
slavery
i
know
i
know
you
wantchee
makee
buy
can
do
you
wantchee
catch
one
piecee
small
baby
can
catchee
two
three
tael
wantchee
one
piecee
very
much
tall
big
piecee
can
catch
fifty
dollar
continuing
he
told
me
that
prices
were
fairly
high
a
girl
who
could
boast
good
looks
and
who
had
reached
an
age
when
her
charms
were
naturally
the
strongest
fetching
the
alarming
amount
of
three
hundred
taels
this
was
the
highest
figure
reached
whilst
small
children
could
be
had
for
anything
up
to
twenty
this
wholesale
disposal
of
young
girls
although
the
traffic
was
in
some
quarters
emphatically
denied
to
exist
a
denial
however
which
was
all
moonshine
is
one
of
the
chief
sorrows
of
the
district
and
well
it
might
be
for
thousands
of
children
are
disposed
of
in
the
course
of
a
year
for
a
few
taels
by
heartless
parents
who
watch
them
being
carried
away
like
so
much
merchandise
to
be
converted
into
silver
in
many
cases
in
this
district
merely
to
satisfy
the
craving
for
opium
of
some
sodden
wretch
of
a
man
who
calls
himself
a
father
time
and
time
again
long
after
i
myself
passed
through
did
i
see
little
girls
from
three
to
ten
years
of
age
being
conveyed
by
to
the
capital
balanced
in
baskets
on
either
side
of
the
animal
this
and
the
terrible
infanticide
which
exists
in
all
poor
districts
of
china
menaces
the
lives
of
all
of
the
entire
province
of
in
the
particular
district
of
which
i
speak
it
is
not
an
uncommon
sight
to
see
little
children
being
torn
to
pieces
by
dogs
the
scavengers
of
the
empire
perhaps
by
the
very
dogs
that
had
been
their
playmates
from
birth
i
have
been
riding
many
times
and
found
that
my
horse
had
stepped
on
a
human
skull
and
near
by
were
the
bones
the
dogs
had
left
as
the
remains
of
the
corpse
i
should
mention
that
since
the
above
was
written
i
have
lived
and
travelled
a
good
deal
around
being
the
only
european
traveller
who
has
ever
penetrated
the
country
to
the
east
of
the
main

this
chapter
was

it
has
been
thought
wise
to
place
it
here
it
deals
with
the
rebellion
of
which
the
outside
world
even
when
it
was
at
its
height
knew
little
but
which
so
recently
as
a
couple
of
months
prior
to
the
date
of
writing
threatened
to
spell
extermination
to
the
foreigners
in
and
the
reader
too
may
welcome
a
digression
from
travel
in
spite
of
all
that
has
been
written
in
previous
and
subsequent
chapters
and
in
face
of
the
universal
cry
of
the
progress
china
is
speedily
realizing
of
the
stoutest
optimism
characteristic
of
the
statesman
and
of
the
student
of
chinese
affairs
a
feeling
of
deep
gloom
at
intervals
overcomes
one
in
the
interior
a
fear
of
some
impending
trouble
there
is
a
rumor
but
one
smiles
at
it
there
are
always
rumors
then
there
are
more
rumors
and
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
pervades
the
atmosphere
a
local
bubble
is
formed
it
bursts
the
whole
of
trust
in
the
sincerity
of
the
reform
of
china
and
her
people
is
brushed
away
to
absolute
unbelief
in
a
few
days
and
it
means
either
a
sudden
onrush
and
brutal
massacre
of
the
foreigners
or
the
thing
blows
over
after
a
short
or
long
time
of
great
strain
and
ultimately
things
assume
a
normality
in
which
the
detection
of
the
slightest
ruffle
in
the
surface
of
social
life
is
hardly
traceable
such
was
the
rebellion
luckily
unattended
by
loss
of
life
among
the
foreigners
it
is
not
yet
over
n
but
it
is
believed
that
the
worst
is
past
at
the
end
of
probably
no
part
of
the
empire
seemed
more
peaceful
two
months
afterwards
the
heads
of
the
europeans
were
demanded
missionaries
were
guarded
by
armed
soldiers
in
their
homes
inside
the
city
walls
and
forbidden
to
go
outside
native
christians
were
brutally
maltreated
and
threatened
with
death
if
they
refused
to
turn
traitor
to
their
beliefs
thousands
of
generally
men
formed
into
armed
bands
were
defiantly
setting
at
naught
the
law
of
the
land
and
the
whole
of
the
main
road
over
which
i
had
passed
from
to
a
distance
of
over
four
hundred
miles
was
blocked
by
infuriated
mobs
who
were
out
to
kill
their
motto
the
famous
boxer
motto
of
exalt
the
dynasty
destroy
the
foreigner
kill
kill
kill
ran
the
cry
for
miles
around
the
countryside
and
a
fearful
repetition
of
the
bloody
history
of
ten
years
ago
was
daily
feared
providential
however
was
it
that
no
foreigner
was
traveling
at
the
time
in
these
districts
and
that
those
who
ignorant
of
the
troubles
desired
to
do
so
were
stopped
at
by
the
consuls
and
at
by
the
missionaries
it
is
a
matter
for
gratitude
also
that
throughout
the
riots
specially
safeguarded
by
the
great
providence
of
god
no
lives
of
europeans
were
lost
and
owing
to
the
praiseworthy
and
obvious
attitude
of
the
missionaries
in
this
area
in
endeavoring
to
keep
the
thing
as
quiet
as
possible
and
the
notoriously
conservative
manner
in
which
consular
reports
upon
such
matters
are
preserved
in
governmental
lockers
practically
nothing
has
been
heard
of
the
uprising
at
times
during
the
four
months
however
the
situation
became
as
i
shall
endeavor
to
show
complicated
in
every
way
the
escape
of
the
foreigners
was
made
absolutely
impossible
by
the
fact
that
the
whole
of
the
roads
even
those
over
the
rough
mountains
leading
south
were
blocked
successfully
by
the
rebelling
forces
and
when
the
deep
gloom
settled
finally
over
the
city
the
fate
of
the
westerners
seemed
sealed
and
their
future
hopeless
all
round
the
houses
the
people
infected
with
that
strange
unaccountable
national
hysteria
so
terrible
in
the
chinese
temperament
rose
up
to
burn
and
kill
mayhap
it
means
little
to
the
man
who
reads
massacres
have
always
been
common
enough
in
china
he
will
say
and
there
are
thousands
of
people
in
europe
who
know
no
more
about
china
than
what
the
telegrams
of
massacres
of
european
missionaries
have
told
them
years
ago
one
almost
expected
this
sort
of
thing
but
at
the
present
day
when
china
is
popularly
supposed
to
be
working
honestly
to
gain
for
herself
an
honorable
place
among
the
nations
it
is
surely
not
to
be
expected
in
the
ordinary
run
of
things
in
days
of
peace
but
we
know
that
such
visions
are
common
to
every
european
in
inland
china
and
even
at
the
coast
men
talk
continually
of
and
believe
that
riots
are
going
to
happen
in
the
near
future
merchant
missionary
traveler
and
official
all
agree
that
there
is
yet
more
trouble
ahead
before
the
west
will
be
won
into
the
confidence
of
china
and
the
people
who
are
studying
the
reform
movement
of
the
young
china
however
and
who
stolidly
refuse
to
study
with
it
the
general
attitude
of
the
common
people
laugh
and
dismiss
with
contempt
the
subject
of
the
possibility
of
further
outbreaks
of
boxerism
in
the
outlying
parts
of
the
empire
but
they
should
not
laugh
the
european
can
not
afford
to
laugh
and
if
he
be
a
sensible
fellow
knows
that
he
can
not
afford
to
treat
with
contempt
the
opinions
of
the
people
who
know
the
more
we
understand
the
vast
interior
of
china
and
the
conservatism
and
peculiarities
of
character
of
the
people
of
that
interior
the
less
disposed
shall
we
be
to
jest
the
less
disposed
to
ridicule
what
i
would
characterize
as
the
strongest
and
most
deadly
of
the
hidden
menaces
of
the
celestial
empire
one
does
not
wish
to
be
pessimistic
but
it
is
foolish
to
close
eyes
to
bare
fact
at
the
moment
i
am
writing
in
the
middle
of
china
i
know
that
i
am
safe
enough
here
but
i
do
not
disguise
from
myself
that
the
wildest
reports
are
still
current
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
me
about
me
and
my
own
kind
in
this
peaceful
city
of
and
it
takes
very
little
to
light
the
fuse
and
to
cause
a
terrible
explosion
here
in
common
with
other
places
in
this
province
a
man
might
be
quite
safe
one
day
and
lose
his
head
the
next
if
he
did
not
at
times
when
the
rebellious
element
is
apparent
conform
strictly
to
the
general
wishes
and
accepted
customs
of
the
people
among
whom
he
is
living
no
we
can
not
afford
to
laugh
we
must
seek
the
opinion
of
those
people
who
were
confined
within
the
walls
of
city
the
silence
of
their
own
homes
broken
up
by
the
distant
uproar
of
a
frantic
chorus
of
yells
and
angry
disputations
sounding
as
it
were
their
very
as
if
they
were
to
form
a
manacled
procession
dragging
their
chains
of
martyrdom
to
their
own
slow
doom
before
we
show
contempt
for
the
opinion
of
those
who
would
tell
the
truth
there
is
more
of
boxerism
in
the
interior
parts
of
china
than
we
know
of
even
as
late
as
the
middle
of
january
of
the
year
there
was
no
rumor
of
any
uprising
about
this
time
however
to
supply
a
serious
deficiency
in
the
revenue
caused
by
the
dropping
of
the
opium
tax
since
that
drug
had
ceased
to
be
grown
a
general
was
levied
which
the
people
refused
to
pay
and
at
the
same
time
they
demanded
that
they
be
allowed
again
to
grow
the
poppy
among
the
population
of
or
more
particularly
among
the
people
around
the
city
especially
the
tribespeople
this
additional
tax
was
supposed
to
have
been
caused
by
the
europeans
and
other
wild
rumors
concerning
the
railway
to
be
opened
in
the
following
april
which
gained
currency
with
remarkable
rapidity
added
to
the
unrest
it
required
only
that
brilliant
phenomenon
of
the
heavens
with
its
wonderful
tail
none
other
than
halley
comet
to
bring
the
whole
to
a
climax
this
was
altogether
too
much
for
the
superstitious
chinese
and
he
looked
upon
the
comet
as
some
evil
omen
organized
and
controlled
by
the
foreigner
especially
for
the
working
of
his
own
selfish
ends
in
the
celestial
empire
and
a
number
believed
it
to
be
a
heavenly
sign
for
the
chinese
to
strike
that
the
riot
was
being
started
was
plain
but
the
first
definite
news
the
foreigners
received
was
on
february
when
an
one
of
the
tribes
whose
little
girl
attended
the
mission
school
was
captured
and
compelled
to
join
the
rebelling
forces
between
on
the
river
of
golden
sand
o
and
in
a
westerly
direction
from
the
town
a
march
would
take
place
on
the
fifteenth
of
that
month
the
europeans
would
be
assassinated
their
houses
would
be
burned
and
looted
so
ran
the
rumor
by
this
date
for
two
days
march
in
all
directions
from
the
rebels
had
camped
and
a
motley
crowd
they
were
mohammendans
chinese
hua
miao
and
other
hooligans
mobilization
was
effected
by
spies
taking
round
secret
cases
the
containing
two
pieces
of
coal
and
a
feather
a
simile
meaning
that
the
rebels
were
to
burn
like
fire
and
fly
like
birds
meanwhile
military
forces
had
been
dispatched
from
the
capital
twelve
days
away
and
from
seven
or
eight
days
away
and
these
to
the
strength
of
a
thousand
now
came
to
the
city
and
it
was
thought
that
the
would
be
able
to
cope
with
the
trouble
now
that
he
had
so
many
armed
troops
soldiers
patrolled
the
city
walls
which
by
the
way
had
to
be
built
up
so
that
the
soldiers
might
be
able
to
get
decent
patrol
more
were
stationed
on
the
premises
of
the
europeans
and
every
defensive
precaution
was
taken
the
officials
were
in
daily
communication
by
telegraph
with
the
viceroy
and
at
first
the
riot
was
kept
well
in
hand
by
government
authorities
but
the
rebels
had
by
this
time
got
together
no
less
than
three
thousand
men
and
were
holding
three
impregnable
positions
on
the
adjacent
hills
and
had
effectually
cut
off
communication
by
the
main
road
despite
their
numbers
they
were
afraid
to
strike
however
and
lucky
it
was
for
the
city
that
the
leaders
were
not
sufficiently
trusted
by
their
followers
many
of
them
pressed
men
men
who
had
joined
the
rebelling
ranks
merely
to
save
their
own
necks
and
their
houses
at
this
time
the
a
sort
of
mayor
of
the
city
demanded
that
the
missionaries
working
among
the
hua
miao
and
two
lady
workers
paying
a
visit
to
that
place
should
return
from
li
away
as
he
could
not
protect
them
in
the
country
a
special
messenger
was
dispatched
demanding
instant
departure
and
in
the
dead
of
night
a
bitter
wintry
night
icy
dark
slippery
and
cold
these
ladies
came
under
cover
to
the
city
they
reached
the
mission
premises
without
molestation
by
this
time
a
new
had
arrived
from
the
capital
having
been
sent
as
a
man
who
could
handle
the
situation
successfully
he
was
a
liu
ta
ren
who
had
previously
held
office
in
the
city
and
whose
cunning
a
scotland
yard
detective
might
envy
p
rumors
grew
more
and
more
serious
the
mandarins
went
all
round
the
countryside
endeavoring
to
pacify
the
people
and
the
foreigners
could
do
nothing
but
sit
tight
through
these
most
trying
days
the
suspense
of
being
shut
up
in
one
house
during
a
time
of
trouble
of
this
nature
hearing
every
rumor
which
lying
tongues
create
and
unable
to
get
at
the
facts
is
far
worse
than
being
in
the
thick
of
things
although
this
would
have
at
once
been
fatal
but
one
needs
to
have
lived
in
china
during
such
a
time
to
understand
the
awful
tension
which
riots
occasion
the
rioters
were
stationed
as
follows
weining
in
to
the
southeast
men

in
to
the
south

several
places
around
the
city
to
the
west
as
far
as
the
river
of
golden
sand
men
on
march
a
night
attack
was
expected
breathless
the
foreigners
waited
in
their
suspense
but
it
passed
off
without
serious
damage
being
done
on
the
sunday
the
missionaries
almost
at
their
wits
end
with
mingled
fear
and
excitement
occasioned
by
the
strain
which
weeks
of
anxiety
must
bring
to
the
strongest
feared
whether
their
services
would
be
got
through
in
peace
meetings
were
being
held
all
around
the
city
and
gradually
the
mandarins
gained
small
successes
prisoners
miserable
specimens
of
men
fighting
for
they
hardly
knew
what
were
captured
and
brought
to
the
city
and
on
march
sixteen
human
heads
thrown
in
one
gruesome
mass
into
a
common
basket
with
upturned
eyes
gaping
into
the
great
unknown
and
bearing
still
the
brutish
stare
of
hysterical
craving
and
morbid
rage
were
carried
by
an
armed
squad
of
military
to
the
they
made
a
ghastly
picture
when
hung
over
the
gate
of
the
city
to
put
the
fear
of
death
into
the
hearts
of
their
brutal
compatriots
the
officials
and
themselves
feeling
the
strain
of
the
whole
business
and
incidentally
fearful
for
the
safety
of
their
own
heads
were
perturbed
all
this
time
by
rumors
coming
from
weining
the
mutineers
of
which
were
alleged
to
be
the
fiercest
of
the
three
bands
up
to
now
the
officials
had
been
playing
a
conciliating
game
they
had
been
trying
vainly
to
pacify
but
now
they
found
that
they
had
to
prove
their
energies
and
their
benevolence
by
acting
the
part
of
tyrants
rather
than
of
administrators
of
mercy
by
warring
rather
than
by
by
fighting
and
forcing
rather
than
by
conciliating
and
persuading
on
easter
tuesday
fighting
took
place
on
the
main
road
to
the
north
when
the
and
his
men
achieved
a
creditable
success
the
rebels
almost
to
a
man
were
taken
and
among
the
prisoners
was
a
girl
who
had
been
distributing
the
beans
a
lovely
damsel
of
eighteen
said
to
have
been
the
fiancée
of
the
leader
of
that
band
both
her
legs
were
shot
through
and
she
was
considerably
mutilated
but
although
the
thought
this
sufficient
punishment
instructions
came
from
the
capital
that
she
must
die
she
was
accordingly
taken
outside
the
city
and
beheaded
this
caused
some
consternation
among
the
rebels
as
the
death
of
the
girl
was
looked
upon
as
an
omen
of
direct
misfortune
for
a
very
long
time
she
had
been
going
around
the
country
dropping
beans
into
the
ground
outside
any
houses
she
came
across
the
superstition
being
that
wherever
a
bean
was
dropped
there
in
the
very
spot
perhaps
at
the
very
moment
for
aught
that
we
know
an
invincible
warrior
would
spring
up
she
had
dropped
some
millions
of
beans
but
the
ranks
were
not
swelled
as
a
consequence
the
had
also
been
out
all
night
and
as
men
were
captured
so
they
were
beheaded
on
the
spot
without
mercy
and
their
heads
subsequently
hung
outside
the
city
gates
the
headman
of
a
small
village
some
forty
li
from
the
city
succeeded
in
capturing
one
of
the
leaders
and
great
credit
was
due
to
him
but
soon
the
leader
was
rescued
again
by
his
followers
who
then
brutally
killed
and
mutilated
the
body
of
the
headman
causing
him
to
undergo
the
ignominy
of
having
his
tongue
and
his
heart
cut
out
fighting
was
going
on
everywhere
and
by
the
end
of
march
things
were
at
their
height
the
fact
that
rain
was
badly
needed
tended
only
to
aggravate
the
situation
and
that
lustrous
comet
made
things
worse
day
by
day
miserable
processions
brought
the
wounded
into
the
city
and
the
last
day
of
the
month
taken
by
sudden
fright
and
almost
getting
out
of
hand
the
people
raised
the
cry
that
the
rebels
were
marching
direct
for
the
city
gates
through
the
capital
tactics
adopted
by
the
mandarins
however
this
was
prevented
but
on
the
following
day
the
chapel
belonging
to
the
united
methodist
mission
at
an
was
burnt
to
the
ground
and
the
houses
of
the
people
razed
and
looted
the
caretaker
a
faithful
hua
miao
convert
was
taken
stripped
of
his
clothing
and
threatened
with
an
awful
death
if
he
did
not
betray
the
foreigners
he
refused
manfully
to
divulge
any
information
whatsoever
and
was
on
the
point
of
being
sacrificed
when
the
came
unexpectedly
upon
the
scene
with
his
military
he
released
the
miao
captured
rebels
killed
sixteen
more
where
they
stood
and
carried
away
many
of
their
horses
and
the
dreaded
boxer
flag
around
which
the
men
rallied
and
now
comes
the
smartest
thing
i
heard
of
throughout
the
rebellion
a
man
named
li
was
the
most
dreaded
of
the
trio
of
rebel
chiefs
a
man
of
marvelous
strength
and
who
seemed
to
be
able
to
fascinate
his
men
and
get
them
to
do
anything
he
wished
and
liu
the
set
himself
the
task
of
capturing
him
disguising
himself
in
the
garb
of
a
pedlar
liu
went
out
towards
li
camp
and
met
three
spies
on
the
for
a
possible
clue
to
the
foreigners
they
asked
him
where
the
was
and
all
about
him
declaring
that
if
he
did
not
tell
them
all
he
knew
they
would
take
him
to
li
and
that
he
would
then
lose
his
head
just
behind
were
a
few
of
liu
best
soldiers
strolling
up
quite
casually
as
if
they
knew
least
in
the
world
of
what
was
going
on
they
made
their
arrest
and
clapped
the
handcuffs
on
them
before
their
captives
knew
it
liu
ordered
that
two
be
beheaded
immediately
which
was
done
and
the
other
man
was
kept
to
show
where
li
camp
was
and
where
li
himself
was
hiding
and
in
this
way
li
the
invincible
was
captured
also
this
was
the
of
the
situation
li
was
brought
back
to
the
city
with
many
other
prisoners
and
a
few
heads
guarded
by
a
strong
body
of
the
military
almost
simultaneously
huang
one
of
the
other
rebel
chiefs
was
captured
and
at
dusk
one
evening
li
was
put
to
death
by
the
slow
process
afraid
that
if
he
were
taken
outside
the
city
his
followers
might
possibly
him
he
was
murdered
outside
the
chief
about
ten
hacks
being
necessary
by
process
adopted
to
sever
the
head
from
the
body
only
two
men
have
been
put
to
death
inside
the
walls
since
the
city
of
was
built
over
two
hundred
years
ago
after
death
had
taken
place
li
was
served
in
the
same
way
as
he
had
served
the
village
headman
and
his
heart
and
his
tongue
were
taken
from
his
body
huang
was
killed
in
the
usual
way
and
his
head
placed
in
a
frame
on
the
city
gate
and
so
there
died
two
of
the
bravest
men
who
have
headed
rebellions
in
this
part
of
country
of
late
years
both
were
handsome
fellows
of
magnificent
physique
and
undaunted
courage
worthy
of
fighting
for
a
better
cause
it
seemed
so
strange
that
two
such
men
should
have
had
to
die
in
the
very
bloom
of
life
when
every
strong
sinew
and
drop
of
blood
must
have
rebelled
at
such
premature
dissolution
and
by
a
death
more
hideous
than
imagination
can
depict
or
speech
describe
just
at
a
time
in
china
awakening
when
such
fellows
might
have
made
for
the
uplifting
of
their
country
and
they
died
because
they
hated
the
foreigner
after
further
desultory
fighting
the
remaining
leader
losing
heart
fled
into
province
and
for
a
time
was
allowed
to
wander
away
but
later
a
sum
of
a
thousand
taels
was
offered
for
him
dead
or
alive
and
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
reward
proving
too
great
a
bait
for
his
followers
he
has
probably
been
given
up
q
in
the
month
of
may
the
miao
people
rose
to
prolong
the
rioting
but
their
efforts
did
not
come
to
much
although
guerilla
warfare
was
prolonged
for
several
weeks
and
british
subjects
were
not
allowed
to
travel
over
the
main
road
beyond
for
some
time
after
indeed
as
i
write
july
permission
for
the
missionaries
to
move
about
is
still
withheld
then
following
the
rebellion
rumors
spread
all
over
the
province
to
the
effect
that
the
foreigners
were
on
the
for
children
and
were
buying
up
as
many
as
they
could
get
at
enormous
prices
to
the
railway
to
which
by
this
time
had
been
opened
to
the
public
daily
were
little
children
brought
to
the
missionaries
and
offered
for
sale
became
common
the
greatest
unrest
prevailed
again
members
of
the
christian
churches
suffered
persecution
and
adherents
kept
at
a
safe
distance
scholars
forsook
the
mission
schools
foreigners
cautiously
kept
within
their
own
premises
as
much
as
they
could
mission
work
was
at
a
standstill
and
all
looked
once
more
grave
enough
two
women
caught
in
the
act
of
stealing
children
at
were
taken
to
the
hung
in
cages
for
a
time
as
a
warning
to
others
and
then
made
to
walk
through
the
streets
shouting
do
steal
children
as
i
have
do
steal
children
as
i
have
if
they
stopped
yelling
soldiers
scourged
them
a
man
was
lynched
in
the
public
streets
in
that
city
for
stealing
a
child
and
only
by
the
adoption
of
the
most
stringent
measures
which
in
england
would
be
considered
barbaric
were
the
mandarins
able
successfully
to
deal
with
the
rumors
and
the
trouble
thereby
caused
even
far
away
down
on
the
capital
road
children
ran
from
me
and
mothers
catching
sight
of
me
would
cover
up
their
little
ones
and
run
away
from
me
behind
barred
doors
so
that
the
foreigner
should
not
get
them
this
latter
trouble
was
felt
pretty
well
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
and
it
must
have
been
very
disappointing
to
christian
missionaries
who
had
been
working
around
the
districts
of
and
for
over
twenty
years
and
had
got
into
close
contact
with
scores
of
men
and
women
to
see
these
very
people
taking
away
their
children
so
that
they
should
not
be
bought
up
by
the
very
missionaries
whose
ministrations
they
had
listened
to
for
years
in
course
of
time
things
settled
down
again
but
at
the
time
my
manuscript
leaves
me
for
the
publisher
the
danger
zone
has
not
been
greatly
reduced
in
concluding
my
few
remarks
on
this
serious
outbreak
the
like
of
which
it
is
to
be
hoped
will
not
be
seen
again
in
this
province
it
is
only
fair
to
chronicle
the
excellent
behavior
of
the
chinese
officials
and
of
the
viceroy
of
in
dealing
with
the
situation
although
he
is
not
i
believe
generally
liked
by
the
people
as
their
ruler
li
chin
hsi
did
all
he
could
to
quell
the
riots
speedily
and
saw
to
it
that
all
the
officials
in
whose
districts
the
rebellion
was
raging
and
who
made
blunders
during
its
progress
were
degraded
in
rank
it
is
difficult
for
europeans
thoroughly
to
grasp
the
situation
from
to
the
viceregal
seat
is
twelve
days
hard
going
and
all
communication
was
done
by
telegraph
seemingly
easy
enough
but
one
must
not
discount
the
slow
chinese
methods
of
doing
things
most
of
the
troops
were
twelve
days
away
and
in
china
in
backward
especially
to
mobilize
a
thousand
men
and
march
them
over
mountains
a
fortnight
from
your
base
is
not
a
thing
to
be
done
at
a
notice
by
the
time
they
would
arrive
it
might
have
been
possible
for
all
the
foreigners
to
have
been
massacred
and
their
premises
demolished
especially
as
the
exits
were
blocked
on
all
sides
but
no
time
was
lost
and
no
pains
were
saved
and
although
the
foreign
residents
who
suffered
in
suspense
more
than
most
missionaries
are
called
upon
to
suffer
may
differ
with
me
in
this
opinion
i
believe
that
not
one
of
the
officials
who
took
part
in
endeavors
to
keep
the
riots
from
assuming
more
actually
dangerous
proportions
could
have
done
more
than
was
done
if
a
man
neglected
his
duty
he
lost
his
button
and
he
deserved
nothing
else
in
butler
the
able
british
the
british
subjects
had
the
greatest
confidence
he
might
have
erred
in
having
declined
from
harassing
the
chinese
foreign
office
to
grant
permission
and
protection
to
britishers
who
wished
to
travel
after
the
leaders
of
the
rebellion
had
been
captured
but
he
undoubtedly
erred
on
the
right
side
an
unfortunate
incident
for
the
united
methodist
missionaries
was
the
fact
that
the
rev
charles
stedeford
who
was
sent
out
by
the
connexion
to
visit
the
whole
of
the
mission
fields
was
able
to
come
only
so
far
as
and
was
forced
to
return
to
europe
without
having
seen
any
of
the
magnificent
work
among
the
hua
miao
after
my
manuscript
went
forward
to
my
publishers
permission
to
travel
and
protection
were
granted
to
british
subjects
again
on
the
main
road
leading
up
to
the
yangtze
valley
the
author
was
the
first
britisher
to
go
from
to
and
as
i
write
as
late
as
the
middle
of
july
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
it
is
unwise
to
travel
over
this
road
for
a
long
time
to
come
unless
it
is
absolutely
imperative
to
do
so
at
i
had
considerable
trouble
in
getting
a
place
to
sleep
and
i
was
glad
when
i
had
passed
at
the
invitation
of
missionaries
working
among
them
i
then
spent
some
months
in
residence
and
travel
in
miaoland
and
only
regret
that
an
extended
account
of
my
experiences
is
not
possible

in

at

he
was
british
consul
at
tengyueh
when
there
was
fighting
down
in
the
south

with
the
footnote
q
he
was
captured
some
months
afterwards
i
believe
at
chapter
x
the
tribes
of
and
mission
work
among
them
men
who
came
through
twenty
years
ago
wrote
of
its
doctors
and
its
medicines
its
poverty
and
its
infanticide
there
seemed
little
else
to
speak
of
although
the
tribes
were
here
then
and
in
a
rawer
state
even
then
than
they
are
at
the
present
time
little
was
known
about
them
and
men
had
not
yet
developed
the
cult
of
putting
their
opinions
upon
this
most
absorbing
topic
into
print
however
scores
of
men
in
europe
are
eagerly
devouring
every
line
of
copy
they
can
get
hold
of
bearing
upon
this
fascinating
ethnological
study
missionaries
are
plagued
by
inquiries
for
information
respecting
the
tribes
of
western
china
and
it
is
a
curious
feature
of
the
situation
that
with
each
article
or
book
coming
before
the
public
contradiction
follows
contradiction
and
very
few
people
not
even
those
resident
in
the
areas
and
working
among
the
tribes
can
agree
absolutely
upon
any
given
points
in
their
data
the
numerous
tribes
i
met
in
china
formed
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
at
the
same
time
most
bewildering
features
of
my
travel
and
i
can
quite
agree
with
major
davies
r
who
tackles
the
tribe
question
with
considerable
ability
in
his
book
on
when
he
says
that
it
is
safe
to
assert
that
in
hardly
any
part
of
the
world
is
there
such
a
large
variety
of
languages
and
dialects
as
are
to
be
found
in
the
country
which
lies
between
assam
and
the
eastern
border
of
and
in
the
countries
to
the
north
of
that
region
the
reason
for
it
is
generally
ascribed
to
the
physical
characteristics
of
the
country
the
high
mountain
ranges
and
deep
rivers
which
have
brought
about
the
differences
in
customs
and
language
and
the
innumerable
tribal
distinctions
so
perplexing
to
him
who
would
put
himself
in
the
position
of
an
inquirer
into
ethnology
i
know
more
than
one
gentleman
in
at
the
present
moment
having
under
preparation
manuscript
upon
this
subject
intended
for
subsequent
publication
and
i
feel
sure
that
their
efforts
will
add
valuable
information
to
the
all
too
limited
supply
now
obtainable
in
the
meantime
i
print
my
own
impressions
i
should
like
it
to
be
known
here
however
that
i
do
not
in
any
way
whatsoever
put
myself
forward
as
an
authority
on
the
question
i
had
not
at
the
time
this
was
written
laid
myself
out
to
make
any
study
of
the
subject
but
the
fact
that
i
have
lived
in
for
a
year
and
a
half
and
have
traveled
from
one
end
of
the
province
to
the
other
in
addition
to
having
come
across
tribes
of
people
in
may
justify
me
in
the
eyes
of
the
reader
for
placing
on
record
my
own
impressions
as
a
general
contribution
to
this
most
exciting
discussion
i
also
lived
at
mentioned
in
the
last
chapter
among
the
hua
miao
for
several
months
traveled
fairly
considerably
in
the
unsurveyed
hill
country
where
they
live
and
am
the
only
man
apart
from
two
missionaries
who
has
ever
been
over
that
wonderful
country
lying
to
the
extreme
of
one
trip
i
made
extending
over
three
weeks
will
ever
remain
with
me
as
a
memorable
time
but
i
regret
that
i
have
no
space
in
this
volume
for
even
the
merest
reference
to
my
journey
some
of
my
friends
in
china
might
say
sarcastically
that
mankind
is
destined
to
arrive
at
years
of
discretion
and
that
i
should
have
known
better
than
to
include
in
my
book
anything
however
well
founded
of
a
nature
tending
to
continue
the
wordy
strife
touching
this
vexed
question
of
mission
work
and
that
no
matter
how
strikingly
set
forth
this
is
an
old
and
obsolete
story
fit
only
to
be
finally
done
with
it
is
for
such
to
bear
with
me
in
what
i
shall
say
there
are
thousands
of
men
in
the
west
who
are
entirely
ignorant
of
men
in
china
other
than
the
ordinary
and
if
i
enlighten
them
ever
so
little
then
this
chapter
will
have
served
an
admirable
end
in
the
tribes
i
came
most
in
contact
with
were
i
the
miao
or
as
the
chinese
call
them
or
the
mhong
or
hmao
as
they
call
themselves
ii
the
or
as
the
chinese
call
them
or
the
nou
su
or
ngo
su
as
they
call
themselves
probably
the
nou
su
tribes
are
what
major
davies
calls
the
lolo
group
in
his
third
division
of
the
great
family
but
i
merely
suggest
it
as
it
strikes
me
that
the
other
branches
of
that
group
including
the
the
and
the
seem
to
be
descendants
of
a
larger
group
of
which
the
nou
su
predominate
in
numbers
language
and
customs
however
this
by
the
way
it
may
not
be
common
knowledge
that
in
most
parts
of
the
chinese
empire
even
there
are
tribes
of
people
essentially
who
still
rigidly
maintain
their
independence
governed
by
their
own
native
rulers
as
they
were
probably
forty
centuries
ago
long
before
their
kingdoms
were
annexed
to
china
proper
there
are
white
bones
and
black
bones
noses
long
and
flattened
eyes
straight
and
oblique
swarthy
faces
faces
yellow
and
white
and
brown
hair
and
many
other
physical
peculiarities
differentiating
one
tribe
from
another
in
many
instances
these
tribes
conquered
slowly
by
the
encroaching
chinese
during
the
long
and
tedious
term
of
centuries
marking
the
growth
of
the
chinese
empire
to
its
present
immensity
are
allowed
to
maintain
their
social
independence
under
their
own
chiefs
who
are
subject
to
the
control
of
the
government
of
china
which
means
that
excessive
taxation
is
paid
to
the
functionary
who
extorts
money
from
anybody
and
everybody
he
can
get
into
his
clutches
and
then
gives
a
free
hand
others
in
a
further
state
of
civilization
have
been
gradually
absorbed
by
the
chinese
and
are
now
barely
distinguishable
from
the
the
chinese
and
others
again
adopting
chinese
dress
customs
and
language
would
give
the
traveler
a
rough
time
of
it
were
he
to
suggest
that
they
are
any
but
pure
chinese
to
the
ethnological
student
it
is
obvious
that
so
soon
as
the
chinese
have
tyrannized
sufficiently
and
in
their
own
inimitable
way
preyed
upon
these
feudal
landlords
enough
to
warrant
their
lands
being
confiscated
reducing
a
tribe
to
a
condition
in
which
far
removed
from
districts
where
live
they
have
no
the
aboriginals
throw
in
their
lot
gradually
with
the
chinese
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
become
chinese
in
language
customs
trade
and
life
this
absorption
by
the
chinese
of
many
tribes
stretching
from
the
burmese
border
to
the
eastern
parts
of
whilst
an
interesting
study
shows
that
the
onward
march
of
civilization
in
china
will
sweep
all
racial
relicts
from
the
face
of
this
great
awakening
empire
but
at
the
same
time
there
are
many
branches
of
a
tribal
family
some
found
as
far
west
as
british
burma
and
all
more
or
less
scattered
and
disorganized
as
the
result
of
this
silent
oppression
going
on
through
the
years
who
still
are
ambitious
of
preserving
their
independent
isolation
particularly
in
spheres
far
removed
from
political
activity
so
remote
are
the
districts
in
which
these
principalities
are
found
that
the
chinese
themselves
are
entirely
ignorant
of
the
characteristics
of
these
tribes
they
say
of
one
tribe
which
is
scattered
all
over
china
far
west
that
they
all
have
tails
and
of
another
tribe
that
the
men
and
women
have
two
faces
and
into
the
official
records
published
by
the
imperial
government
the
grossest
inaccuracies
creep
concerning
the
origin
of
these
peoples
and
and
a
great
part
of
in
the
main
still
untouched
by
the
increased
taxation
necessary
to
provide
revenue
to
uphold
the
reforms
brought
about
by
the
forward
movement
in
various
parts
of
the
empire
are
where
the
aboriginal
population
is
most
evident
this
part
of
the
empire
might
be
called
the
ethnological
garden
of
tribes
and
various
races
in
various
stages
of
uncivilization
these
secluded
mountain
areas
their
unaltered
conditions
still
telling
forth
the
story
of
the
world
youth
have
been
the
cradle
and
the
of
nations
of
vigorous
and
ambitious
tribes
bent
on
conquest
and
a
career
of
glory
the
miao
of
the
miao
with
its
various
sections
we
know
a
good
deal
their
real
home
has
been
pretty
finally
decided
to
be
in
province
and
they
probably
in
former
times
extended
far
into
the
chinese
of
these
provinces
at
the
present
time
having
undoubtedly
a
good
deal
of
miao
blood
in
their
veins
they
are
comparatively
recent
arrivals
in
but
are
gradually
extending
farther
and
farther
to
the
west
maintaining
their
language
and
their
dress
and
customs
i
personally
found
them
as
far
west
as
thirty
miles
beyond
a
little
off
the
main
road
but
major
davies
found
them
far
up
on
the
tibetan
border
he
says
the
most
westerly
point
that
i
have
come
across
them
is
the
neighborhood
of
tawnio
lat
long
through
central
and
northern
they
do
not
seem
to
exist
but
they
reappear
again
to
the
north
of
this
in
western
where
there
are
a
few
villages
in
the
basin
of
the
yalung
river
lat
long
the
major
was
evidently
ignorant
of
this
miao
district
of
to
the
of
the
province
stretching
three
days
from
right
away
on
to
in
a
north
line
miao
villages
are
met
with
fairly
well
the
whole
way
then
three
days
from
in
a
direction
we
come
to
the
miao
village
of
and
then
striking
through
country
absolutely
unsurveyed
part
of
the
way
is
met
this
last
place
is
the
headquarters
of
the
china
inland
mission
where
at
the
present
rate
of
progress
one
might
modestly
estimate
that
in
twenty
years
there
will
be
no
less
than
a
million
people
receiving
christian
teaching
these
are
not
all
miao
however
there
are
besides
and
many
other
tribes
with
which
we
have
no
concern
at
the
present
moment
so
that
it
may
be
seen
that
from
the
capital
in
areas
on
either
side
of
the
main
road
leading
up
to
the
bifurcation
of
the
yangtze
below
in
a
long
narrow
neck
running
between
the
river
of
golden
sand
and
the
border
miao
are
met
with
constantly
and
then
of
course
over
the
river
in
they
are
met
with
again
and
in
farther
west
we
have
their
real
home
it
is
a
far
cry
from
to
malaysia
but
as
i
get
into
closer
contact
with
the
miao
people
the
more
do
i
find
them
in
many
common
ways
of
everyday
customs
and
points
of
character
akin
to
the
malays
and
the
sakai
the
jungle
hill
people
of
the
malay
peninsula
among
whom
i
have
traveled
their
modes
of
living
contain
many
points
in
common
ethnologists
probably
may
smile
at
this
assertion
the
same
as
i
who
have
lived
among
the
miao
have
smiled
at
a
good
deal
which
has
come
from
the
pens
of
men
who
have
not
in
this
area
there
are
two
great
branches
of
the
miao
race
i
the
hua
miao
the
flowery
or
white
miao
ii
the
heh
miao
the
black
miao
many
photographs
of
the
hua
miao
are
reproduced
in
this
volume
the
latter
are
considered
as
the
superior
of
the
two
sections
speak
a
different
tongue
and
differ
more
or
less
widely
in
their
methods
dress
and
customs
a
study
of
which
would
lead
one
into
a
lifetime
of
interminable
disquisitions
at
the
end
of
which
one
would
be
little
more
enlightened
those
who
wish
to
study
the
question
of
differences
of
the
miao
are
referred
to
clarke
and
prince
henri
tonkin
aux
and
baber
works
major
davies
also
gives
some
new
information
concerning
this
hill
people
and
is
generally
correct
in
what
he
says
but
in
his
as
in
all
the
books
which
touch
upon
the
subject
the
language
tests
vary
considerably
in
and
the
surrounding
districts
for
instance
the
traveler
would
be
unable
to
make
any
progress
with
the
vocabulary
which
the
major
has
compiled
i
was
unable
to
make
it
tally
with
the
spoken
language
of
the
people
and
append
a
table
showing
the
differences
in
the
phonetic
and
i
do
it
with
all
respect
to
major
davies
i
ought
to
add
that
this
is
the
language
of
the
corner
of
that
of
major
davies
is
taken
from
page
of
his
book
he
says
that
the
words
given
by
him
will
not
be
found
to
correspond
in
every
case
with
those
in
the
miao
vocabulary
in
the
pocket
of
the
cover
of
his
book
and
some
have
been
taken
from
other
miao
dialects
however
the
comparison
will
be

the
miao
language
was
until
a
year
or
two
ago
only
spoken
it
was
never
written
and
no
one
ever
dreamed
that
it
could
be
written
at
the
time
of
the
great
miao
revival
when
thousands
of
miao
made
a
raid
on
the
mission
premises
at
and
implored
the
missionaries
to
come
and
teach
them
it
was
found
absolutely
necessary
that
the
language
should
be
reduced
to
writing
and
the
whole
of
this
extremely
creditable
work
fell
to
the
rev
samuel
pollard
who
may
be
characterized
as
the
pioneer
of
this
christianizing
movement
in
in
reducing
the
language
to
writing
however
considerable
difficulty
was
complicated
by
the
presence
of
tones
so
well
known
to
all
students
of
chinese
itself
said
to
be
an
invention
of
the
devil
tones
introduce
another
element
or
dimension
into
speech
the
number
of
sounds
not
being
sufficient
for
the
reproduction
of
all
the
spoken
ideas
has
been
multiplied
by
giving
these
various
sounds
in
different
tones
it
is
as
if
the
element
of
music
were
introduced
according
to
rule
into
speech
and
as
if
one
had
not
only
to
remember
the
words
in
everything
he
wished
to
say
but
the
tune
also
the
miao
people
being
so
low
down
in
the
intellectual
scale
and
having
never
been
accustomed
to
study
it
was
felt
by
the
promoters
of
the
written
language
that
they
should
be
as
simple
as
possible
and
hence
they
looked
about
for
some
system
which
could
be
readily
grasped
by
these
ignorant
people
it
was
necessary
that
the
system
be
absolutely
phonetic
and
understood
easily
by
adapting
the
system
used
in
shorthand
of
putting
the
vowel
marks
in
different
positions
by
the
side
of
the
consonant
signs
pollard
and
his
assistant
found
that
they
could
solve
their
problem
the
signs
for
the
consonants
are
larger
than
the
vowel
signs
and
the
position
of
the
latter
by
the
side
of
the
former
gives
the
tone
or
musical
note
required
at
the
present
time
there
are
thousands
of
miao
now
able
to
read
and
write
and
the
work
of
this
enterprising
missionary
has
conferred
an
inestimable
boon
upon
this
people
when
i
went
among
the
miao
i
was
able
after
ten
minutes
instruction
to
stand
up
and
sing
their
hymns
and
read
their
gospels
with
them
miao
women
who
heretofore
had
never
hoped
to
read
are
now
put
in
possession
of
the
word
of
god
and
the
simplicity
of
the
written
language
enables
them
almost
at
once
to
read
the
story
of
the
cross
surely
this
is
one
of
the
outstanding
features
of
mission
work
in
the
whole
of
china
i
hope
at
some
future
date
to
publish
a
work
devoted
exclusively
to
my
travels
among
the
hua
miao
for
i
feel
that
their
story
no
matter
how
simply
written
is
one
of
the
great
untold
romances
of
the
world
as
a
people
they
are
extremely
fascinating
in
life
and
customs
emotional
and
absolutely
distinct
from
with
hardly
a
manner
of
daily
life
in
common
with
the
chinese
mission
work
among
the
miao
whilst
referring
to
mission
work
it
is
a
great
privilege
for
the
writer
to
add
a
word
of
most
deserved
eulogy
of
the
united
methodist
mission
at
and
and
to
the
kindness
shown
by
the
missionaries
towards
me
when
i
came
an
absolute
stranger
among
them
in
may
it
is
to
two
members
of
this
mission
that
i
owe
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
it
was
and
evans
of
who
saved
my
life
a
week
or
two
after
i
left
as
is
recorded
in
a
subsequent
chapter
it
was
in
the
old
days
of
the
bible
christian
mission
than
which
the
individual
members
of
no
mission
in
the
whole
of
china
worked
with
more
zeal
and
lower
stipends
that
a
most
interesting
development
in
the
mission
took
place
the
mass
of
the
miao
are
the
serfs
of
the
descendants
of
their
ancient
kings
who
are
large
landowners
and
the
miao
are
tenants
in
the
miao
heard
of
the
gospel
and
came
to
listen
to
the
preaching
and
thousands
came
in
batches
at
one
time
and
another
to
the
mission
house
their
movements
thus
aroused
suspicion
among
the
chinese
there
was
a
good
deal
of
persecution
and
personal
violence
and
at
one
time
it
looked
as
if
there
might
be
serious
trouble
but
the
danger
quieted
down
the
chieftain
gave
land
the
miao
contributed
one
hundred
pounds
sterling
and
themselves
put
up
a
chapel
large
enough
to
accommodate
six
hundred
people
a
year
later
a
thousand
at
a
time
crowded
their
simple
sanctuary
and
in
nearly
six
thousand
were
members
or
probationers
and
the
work
has
steadily
progressed
ever
since
i
am
indebted
to
the
rev
parsons
who
had
charge
of
the
work
at
the
time
i
passed
through
this
district
and
whose
guest
i
was
for
several
months
for
the
following
interesting
details
regarding
the
methods
adopted
in
the
running
of
this
enormous
mission
field
parsons
is
assisted
in
his
work
by
his
genial
wife
who
is
a
most
ardent
worker
and
a
capable
miao
linguist
parsons
regularly
addresses
congregations
of
several
hundreds
of
miao
and
has
traveled
on
journeys
often
with
her
husband
and
such
work
as
hers
with
several
others
in
this
mission
is
a
testimony
to
the
wisdom
of
a
system
advocating
the
increase
of
the
number
of
lady
workers
on
the
mission
field
in
china
the
or
there
is
a
class
of
people
around
who
are
called
a
people
who
although
occupying
the
plain
at
the
time
the
chinese
arrived
are
believed
not
to
be
the
aboriginals
of
the
district
what
i
actually
know
about
this
people
is
not
much
i
have
heard
a
good
deal
but
it
must
not
be
understood
that
i
publish
this
as
absolutely
the
final
word
people
who
have
lived
in
the
district
for
many
years
do
not
agree
so
that
for
a
mere
traveler
the
task
of
getting
infallible
data
would
be
quite
formidable
no
tribe
is
more
widely
known
than
the
with
their
innumerable
tribal
distinctions
and
hereditary
peculiarities
so
perplexing
to
the
inquirer
into
far
western
china
ethnology
the
are
a
very
fine
tall
race
with
comparatively
fair
complexions
suggesting
a
mixture
of
mongolian
with
some
other
people
of
their
origin
however
little
can
be
vouched
for
and
with
it
we
will
have
nothing
to
do
here
but
at
the
present
time
the
provide
a
good
deal
of
interest
from
the
fact
that
their
power
as
tyrannic
landlords
and
feudal
chiefs
is
fast
dying
and
it
may
be
that
in
a
couple
of
decades
or
a
still
shorter
time
a
people
who
by
obstinate
and
great
dislike
to
the
chinese
have
remained
unaffected
by
the
absorbing
spirit
of
the
arbitrary
chinese
will
have
passed
beyond
the
vale
of
personality
even
now
however
they
own
and
rule
enormous
tracts
of
country
notably
that
part
lying
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
of
golden
sand
in
some
are
very
wealthy
one
man
may
own
vast
tracts
bigger
than
yorkshire
in
this
tract
there
may
be
one
hundred
villages
all
paying
tribute
to
him
and
subject
to
the
vagaries
of
his
vilest
despotism
from
his
tyranny
his
struggling
tenantry
have
no
redress
so
long
as
the
the
local
name
of
the
greases
the
palm
of
the
squeezing
chinese
mandarin
in
whose
nominal
control
the
district
extends
he
may
run
riot
as
he
pleases
social
law
and
order
are
unknown
justice
is
a
complete
contradiction
in
terms
and
whilst
one
is
in
the
midst
of
it
it
is
difficult
to
realize
that
in
china
the
china
which
all
the
world
believes
to
be
awakening
there
exists
a
condition
of
things
which
will
allow
a
man
to
torture
to
plunder
to
murder
and
to
indulge
to
the
utmost
degree
the
whims
of
a
neronic
and
devilish
temperament
slave
trading
is
common
if
a
tenant
can
not
pay
his
tribute
he
sells
himself
for
a
few
taels
and
becomes
the
slave
of
his
former
landlord
and
if
he
would
save
his
head
treads
carefully
in
the
early
days
when
different
clans
were
driven
farther
into
the
hills
they
each
clinched
as
much
land
as
they
could
in
course
of
time
by
petty
quarrels
civil
wars
and
common
feuds
the
were
gradually
thinned
out
the
the
men
of
the
hills
and
the
serfs
of
the
landlords
who
four
thousand
years
ago
were
a
powerful
race
in
their
own
kingdom
became
the
tenants
of
the
whose
rule
is
still
marked
by
the
grossest
infamy
possible
to
be
practiced
on
the
human
race
all
the
methods
of
torture
which
in
the
old
days
were
associated
with
the
chinese
are
still
in
vogue
in
many
cases
in
an
aggravated
form
i
have
personally
seen
the
tortures
and
have
listened
to
the
stories
of
the
victims
but
it
would
not
bear
description
in
print
it
must
not
however
be
understood
that
to
be
a
is
to
be
a
landlord
by
no
means
for
in
the
gradual
process
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
when
the
weaker
landlords
were
murdered
by
their
stronger
compatriots
and
their
lands
seized
only
a
small
percentage
of
the
tribe
in
this
area
have
been
able
to
hold
sway
however
wherever
there
are
landlords
in
this
part
of
the
country
they
are
always
or
chinese
the
miao
or
at
least
the
hua
miao
own
no
lands
and
are
body
and
soul
in
the
tyrannic
clutch
of
the
tyrannic
then
again
in
the
tribe
there
are
various
hereditary
distinctions
enabling
a
man
to
claim
caste
advantage
there
are
the
black
bones
as
they
style
themselves
the
aristocrats
of
the
race
and
the
white
bones
the
lower
breeds
who
obey
to
the
letter
their
wealthier
brethren
or
anybody
who
has
authority
over
them
the
who
are
a
totally
different
race
and
a
much
better
class
than
the
miao
are
believed
to
have
been
driven
from
the
plain
preferring
migration
to
fighting
and
many
trekked
across
the
yangtze
locally
called
the
river
into
country
now
marked
on
good
maps
as
the
country
it
appears
that
the
following
are
the
two
important
branches
i
the
black
farmers
and
landowners
ii
the
white
generally
slaves
other
minor
classes
are
i
the
lakes
or
red
mostly
blacksmiths
ii
the
mostly
who
rightly
or
wrongly
claim
relationship
with
the
chinese
iii
another
class
who
are
mostly
the
two
great
divisions
however
are
the
white
and
the
black
the
latter
class
themselves
the
owners
of
land
claim
that
all
the
white
were
originally
slaves
and
that
those
who
are
now
free
have
escaped
at
some
previous
period
from
servitude
men
as
usual
among
such
tribes
are
scarcely
distinguishable
from
the
ordinary
it
is
the
women
with
their
peculiar
and
picturesque
skirts
who
maintain
the
distinguishing
features
of
the
race
for
the
most
part
the
are
not
idolaters
no
idols
are
in
their
houses
that
portion
of
the
tribe
which
migrated
across
the
yangtze
secure
among
the
mountains
has
never
ceased
to
harass
the
chinese
who
now
dwell
on
land
which
the
themselves
once
tilled
or
at
least
inhabited
but
they
have
been
driven
into
remoter
districts
and
are
only
found
away
from
the
highways
of
chinese
travel
the
race
too
is
dying
out
in
this
area
at
all
events
and
the
themselves
reckon
that
their
numbers
have
decreased
by
during
the
last
thirty
years
this
is
one
of
the
saddest
facts
the
insanitation
of
their
dwellings
their
rough
diet
and
frequent
riotings
in
wine
opium
and
other
evils
are
quickly
playing
havoc
in
their
ranks
giving
the
strong
the
opportunity
of
enriching
themselves
at
the
expense
of
the
weak
with
frequent
fighting
about
the
division
of
land
europeans
who
can
speak
the
language
of
the
are
numbered
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
to
one
who
has
traveled
in
this
neighborhood
for
any
length
of
time
it
must
be
apparent
that
the
unique
method
generally
adopted
by
the
that
is
the
landlord
class
to
get
rich
quickly
is
to
kill
off
their
neighbor
the
lives
these
men
live
with
nothing
but
scandal
and
licentiousness
to
pass
their
time
are
grossly
and
horribly
wicked
when
viewed
by
the
westerner
they
all
live
in
fear
of
their
lives
and
are
each
afraid
of
the
others
all
entertaining
a
secret
hatred
and
all
ever
on
the
alert
to
devise
some
safe
scheme
to
murder
the
owner
of
some
land
they
are
anxious
of
annexing
to
their
own
and
in
the
doing
of
the
deed
to
save
their
own
necks
if
they
succeed
they
are
accounted
clever
men
as
i
write
i
hear
of
a
man
quite
a
youngster
himself
an
exceedingly
wealthy
man
who
killed
his
brother
and
confiscated
his
property
with
no
compunction
whatever
when
tackled
on
the
subject
he
said
he
could
do
nothing
else
for
if
he
had
not
killed
his
brother
his
brother
would
have
killed
him
yet
there
is
no
sense
of
crime
as
we
of
the
west
understand
it
and
nothing
is
feared
from
the
chinese
law
a
man
kills
a
slave
tortures
him
to
death
and
when
the
chinese
mandarin
is
appealed
to
if
he
is
at
all
he
looks
wise
and
says
i
quite
see
your
point
but
i
can
do
nothing
the
murdered
man
was
the
landlord
slave
and
with
a
gentle
wave
of
his
he
explains
how
a
man
may
kill
his
slave
his
wife
or
his
son
and
the
law
can
do
nothing
that
is
if
he
compensates
the
mandarin
a
looked
upon
a
girl
one
day
when
he
was
out
collecting
tribute
she
was
handsome
and
he
instructed
his
men
to
take
her
she
refused
a
sum
of
one
hundred
ounces
of
silver
was
offered
to
anyone
who
would
kidnap
her
and
carry
her
off
to
his
harem
eventually
he
got
the
girl
and
had
her
father
tortured
and
then
put
to
death
because
he
would
not
deliver
his
daughter
over
to
him
yet
there
is
no
redress
women
their
feet
unbound
with
high
foreheads
and
features
with
fiery
eyes
set
in
not
unkindly
faces
tall
and
healthy
would
be
considered
handsome
women
in
any
country
in
europe
they
rarely
intermarry
with
other
tribes
a
good
deal
of
affection
certainly
exists
sometimes
between
husband
and
wife
and
between
parents
and
children
but
the
looseness
of
the
marriage
relation
leads
to
unending
strife
many
europeans
travelers
and
missionaries
have
been
murdered
in
the
country
inhabited
by
the
independent
lolo
people
although
i
have
not
personally
been
through
any
of
that
country
i
have
been
on
the
very
outskirts
and
have
lived
for
a
long
time
among
the
people
there
i
found
them
a
pleasant
hospitable
race
fairly
easy
to
get
on
with
and
it
must
not
be
averred
that
because
they
consider
their
natural
enemy
the
chinese
the
man
to
be
robbed
and
murdered
and
because
they
kill
off
their
in
order
the
more
quickly
to
get
rich
that
they
treat
all
strangers
alike
among
the
europeans
who
have
suffered
death
at
their
hands
it
is
probable
that
in
some
way
the
cause
was
traceable
to
their
own
bearing
towards
the
people
either
a
total
lack
of
knowledge
of
their
language
or
an
attitude
which
caused
suspicion
among
the
strong
as
this
feudal
life
still
is
the
chinese
are
fast
gaining
permanent
influence
their
dissolute
and
drunken
and
inhuman
daily
practices
are
tending
to
work
out
among
this
people
their
own
destruction
and
in
years
to
come
in
this
neighborhood
the
traveler
will
be
perplexed
at
finding
here
and
there
a
fine
specimen
of
an
upstanding
chinese
with
face
straight
of
feature
and
straight
of
limb
with
a
peculiar
mongol
look
about
him
he
will
be
one
of
the
surviving
specimens
of
a
race
of
people
the
whose
forgotten
historical
records
would
do
much
to
clear
up
the
doubt
attaching
to
and
ethnology
the
first
chieftain
to
come
to
a
man
who
was
renowned
as
a
tryannical
brute
was
one
ien
who
frequently
gouged
out
the
eyes
of
those
who
disobeyed
his
commands
and
his
descendants
are
said
to
have
inherited
a
good
many
of
this
tyrant
vices
the
landlords
prey
upon
their
weaker
brethren
and
at
last
with
infinite
sagacity
the
chinese
government
steps
in
to
stop
the
quarrels
confiscates
the
whole
of
the
property
and
thus
reduces
the
land
to
immediate
control
of
chinese
authorities
the
are
of
course
entirely
dependent
upon
the
land
for
their
living
they
till
the
soil
and
rear
cattle
and
the
greatest
calamity
that
can
come
upon
any
family
is
that
their
land
shall
be
taken
from
them
to
be
landless
involves
degradation
as
well
as
poverty
and
very
severe
hardship
is
the
lot
of
men
who
have
been
deprived
of
this
means
of
subsistence
for
those
who
own
no
land
but
who
are
merely
tenants
of
the
s
there
seems
to
be
no
security
of
tenure
but
still
if
the
wishes
and
demands
of
the
landlords
are
complied
with
one
family
may
till
the
same
farm
for
many
successive
generations
the
terms
on
which
land
is
held
are
peculiar
the
rental
agreed
upon
is
nominal
large
tracts
of
country
are
rented
for
a
pig
or
a
sheep
or
a
fowl
with
a
little
corn
per
year
beside
this
nominal
rent
the
landlord
has
the
right
to
make
levies
on
his
tenants
on
all
special
occasions
such
as
funerals
weddings
or
for
any
other
extraordinary
expenses
he
can
also
require
his
tenants
with
their
cattle
to
render
services
this
system
necessarily
leads
to
much
oppression
and
injustice
it
is
also
said
that
if
a
family
is
hard
pressed
by
a
and
reduced
to
extreme
poverty
they
will
make
themselves
over
to
him
on
condition
that
a
portion
of
his
land
be
given
them
to
cultivate
such
people
are
called
caught
slaves
as
distinguished
from
hereditary
and
the
eldest
children
become
the
absolute
property
of
the
landlord
and
are
generally
given
as
attendants
upon
his
wife
and
daughters
every
farmer
owns
a
large
number
of
slaves
who
live
in
the
same
compound
as
himself
these
people
do
all
the
work
of
the
farm
while
the
master
employs
himself
as
his
fancy
leads
him
over
these
unfortunate
people
the
owner
has
absolute
control
all
their
affairs
are
managed
by
him
his
girl
slaves
he
marries
off
to
other
men
slave
boys
and
similarly
obtains
wives
for
his
male
slaves
the
lot
of
these
unfortunate
people
is
hard
beyond
description
being
considered
but
little
more
valuable
than
the
cattle
they
tend
the
food
given
to
them
is
often
inferior
to
the
corn
upon
which
the
master
horse
is
fed
the
cruel
beatings
and
torturings
they
have
been
subject
to
have
completely
broken
their
spirit
and
now
they
seem
unable
to
exist
apart
from
their
masters
very
seldom
do
any
of
them
try
to
escape
for
no
one
will
give
them
shelter
and
the
punishment
awarded
a
recaptured
slave
is
so
severe
as
to
intimidate
the
most
daring
these
poor
folk
are
born
in
slavery
married
in
slavery
and
they
die
in
slavery
it
is
not
uncommon
to
meet
with
chinese
slaves
both
boys
and
girls
in
families
these
have
either
been
kidnapped
and
sold
or
their
parents
unable
to
nourish
them
have
bartered
them
in
exchange
for
food
their
purchasers
marry
them
to
and
their
lot
is
thrown
in
with
the
slave
class
heart
is
wrung
with
anguish
sometimes
as
he
thinks
of
what
cruelty
and
wretchedness
exist
among
the
hills
of
this
benighted
district
even
here
however
light
is
beginning
to
shine
for
some
adherents
of
the
christian
religion
have
changed
their
slaves
into
tenants
thus
showing
the
way
to
the
ultimate
solution
of
this
difficult
problem
the
life
in
a
household
is
not
very
complex
the
cattle
are
driven
out
early
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
the
sun
has
risen
they
remain
out
until
the
breakfast
hour
and
then
return
to
the
stables
and
rest
during
the
heat
of
the
day
going
out
again
in
the
cool
hours
the
food
of
the
household
is
prepared
by
the
slaves
under
the
direction
of
the
lady
of
the
house
there
is
no
refined
cooking
for
the
despises
food
and
complains
that
it
never
satisfies
him
he
has
a
couplet
which
runs
you
eat
raw
food
you
become
a
warrior
if
you
eat
it
cooked
you
suffer
hunger
no
chairs
or
tables
are
found
in
a
genuine
house
the
food
is
served
up
in
a
large
bowl
placed
on
the
floor
the
family
sit
around
and
each
one
helps
himself
with
a
large
wooden
spoon
at
the
present
time
the
refinements
of
chinese
civilization
have
been
adopted
by
a
large
number
of
and
the
homes
of
the
wealthier
people
are
as
well
furnished
as
those
of
the
chinese
of
the
district
the
women
of
the
households
also
spend
much
time
making
their
own
and
their
children
clothes
the
men
have
adopted
chinese
dress
but
the
women
in
most
cases
retain
their
tribal
costume
with
its
large
its
plaited
skirt
and
intricately
embroidered
coat
all
this
is
made
by
hand
and
the
choicest
years
of
maidenhood
are
occupied
in
preparing
the
clothes
for
the
the
it
would
seem
used
not
to
beg
a
wife
but
rather
obtained
her
by
main
force
at
the
present
day
while
the
milder
method
generally
prevails
there
are
still
survivals
of
the
ancient
custom
the
betrothal
truly
takes
place
very
early
even
in
infancy
and
at
the
ceremony
a
fowl
is
killed
and
each
contracting
party
takes
a
rib
but
as
the
young
folk
grow
to
marriageable
age
the
final
negotiations
have
to
be
made
these
are
purposely
prolonged
until
the
bridegroom
growing
angry
gathers
his
friends
and
makes
an
attack
on
the
maiden
home
arming
themselves
with
cudgels
they
approach
secretly
and
protecting
their
heads
and
shoulders
with
their
felt
cloaks
they
rush
towards
the
house
strenuous
efforts
are
made
by
the
occupants
to
prevent
their
entering
and
severe
blows
are
exchanged
when
the
attacking
party
has
succeeded
in
gaining
an
entrance
peace
is
proclaimed
and
wine
and
huge
chunks
of
flesh
are
provided
for
their
entertainment
occasionally
during
these
fights
the
maiden
home
is
quite
dismantled
the
negotiations
being
ended
preparations
are
made
to
escort
the
bride
to
her
future
home
heavily
veiled
she
is
supported
on
horseback
by
her
brothers
while
her
near
relatives
all
fully
armed
attend
her
on
arriving
at
the
house
a
scuffle
ensues
the
veil
is
snatched
from
the
bride
face
by
her
relatives
who
do
their
utmost
to
throw
it
on
to
the
roof

indication
of
the

with
which
the
newcomer
will

much

in
these
skirmishes
the
new
bride

for

days

waits
many
years

she
pays

some
allow
ten
or
more

and
importance

tree
is
planted

the
hope
that
as
the
tree
grows
so
also
will
the
child
develop
the
fear
of
disease
lies
heavily
upon
the
people
and
their
disregard
of
the
most
elementary
sanitary
laws
makes
them
very
liable
to
attacks
of
sickness
they
understand
almost
nothing
about
medicine
and
consequently
resort
to
superstitious
practices
in
order
to
ward
off
the
evil
influences
when
it
is
known
that
disease
has
visited
a
house
a
pole
seven
feet
long
is
erected
in
a
conspicuous
place
in
a
thicket
some
distance
from
the
house
to
be
guarded
on
the
pole
an
old
ploughshare
is
fixed
and
it
is
supposed
that
when
the
spirit
who
controls
the
disease
sees
the
ploughshare
he
will
retire
to
a
distance
of
three
homesteads
a
fever
called
works
great
havoc
among
the
every
year
and
the
people
are
very
much
afraid
of
it
no
person
will
stay
by
the
to
nurse
the
unfortunate
victim
instead
food
and
water
are
placed
by
his
bedside
and
covered
with
his
quilt
he
is
left
at
the
mercy
of
the
disease
since
as
the
fever
progresses
the
patient
will
perspire
heavy
stones
are
placed
on
the
quilt
that
it
may
not
be
thrown
off
and
the
sick
person
take
cold
many
an
unfortunate
sufferer
has
through
this
strange
practice
died
from
suffocation
after
a
time
the
relatives
will
return
to
see
what
course
the
disease
has
taken
this
fever
seems
to
yield
to
quinine
for
john
li
has
seen
several
persons
recover
to
whom
he
had
administered
this
drug
when
a
man
dies
his
relatives
as
soon
as
they
receive
the
news
hold
in
their
several
homes
a
feast
of
mourning
called
by
them
the
za
a
pig
or
sheep
is
sacrificed
at
the
doorway
and
it
is
supposed
that
intercourse
is
thus
maintained
between
the
living
persons
and
the
late
departed
spirit
the
near
kindred
on
hearing
of
the
death
of
a
relative
take
a
fowl
and
strangle
it
the
shedding
of
its
blood
is
not
permissible
this
fowl
is
cleaned
and
skewered
and
the
mourner
then
proceeds
to
the
house
where
the
deceased
person
is
lying
and
sticks
this
fowl
at
the
head
of
the
corpse
as
an
offering
the
more
distant
relatives
do
not
perform
this
rite
but
each
leads
a
sheep
to
the
house
of
mourning
and
the
son
of
the
deceased
man
strikes
each
animal
three
times
with
a
white
wand
while
the
priest
or
magician
stands
by
and
announcing
the
sacrifice
by
calling
and
so
giving
of
course
the
name
presents
the
soft
woolly
offering
formerly
the
burned
their
dead
said
a
youth
to
me
years
ago
thought
of
our
friends
bodies
either
turning
to
corruption
or
being
eaten
by
wild
beasts
is
distasteful
to
us
and
therefore
we
burn
our
dead
the
corpse
is
burnt
with
wood
and
during
the
cremation
the
mourners
arrange
themselves
around
the
fire
and
chant
and
dance
the
ashes
are
buried
and
the
ground
leveled
this
custom
is
still
adhered
to
among
the
of
the
independent
lolo
territory
or
more
correctly
papu
country
of
western
the
tribesmen
who
dwell
in
the
neighborhood
of
weining
and
have
adopted
burial
as
the
means
of
disposing
of
their
dead
adding
some
customs
peculiar
to
themselves
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
the
horse
which
the
deceased
man
was
in
the
habit
of
riding
is
brought
to
the
door
and
saddled
by
the
pehmo
the
command
is
then
given
to
lead
the
horse
to
the
grave
all
the
mourners
follow
and
marching
or
dancing
in
intertwining
circles
cross
and
recross
the
path
of
the
led
horse
until
the
poor
creature
grown
frantic
with
fear
rushes
and
kicks
in
wild
endeavor
to
escape
from
the
confusion
the
whole
company
then
raise
a
great
shout
and
call
soul
has
come
to
ride
the
horse
the
soul
has
come
to
ride
the
horse
a
contest
then
follows
among
the
women
of
the
deceased
man
household
for
the
possession
of
this
horse
which
is
henceforth
regarded
as
of
extreme
value
it
is
difficult
to
discover
much
about
the
religion
of
the
because
so
many
of
their
ancient
customs
have
fallen
into
disuse
during
the
intercourse
of
the
people
with
the
chinese
at
the
ingathering
of
the
buckwheat
when
the
crop
is
stacked
on
the
threshing
floor
and
the
work
of
threshing
is
about
to
begin
the
simple
formula
you
ilsomo
is
used
ilsomo
seems
to
be
a
spirit
who
has
control
over
the
crops
whether
good
or
evil
it
is
not
easy
to
determine
ilsomo
is
not
god
for
at
present
when
the
wish
to
speak
of
god
they
use
the
word
soe
which
means
master
in
the
independent
territory
of
the
to
the
west
of
the
term
used
for
god
is
and
a
who
has
much
intercourse
with
the
independent
people
contends
that
there
are
three
names
indicative
of
god
each
representing
different
functions
if
not
persons
of
the
godhead
these
names
are
the
believe
in
ancestor
worship
and
perhaps
the
most
interesting
feature
of
their
religion
is
the
peculiar
form
this
worship
takes
instead
of
an
ancestral
tablet
such
as
the
chinese
use
the
worship
a
small
basket
lolo
about
as
large
as
a
duck
egg
and
made
of
split
bamboo
this
contains
small
bamboo
tubes
an
inch
or
two
long
and
as
thick
as
an
ordinary
chinese
pen
handle
in
these
tubes
are
fastened
a
piece
of
grass
and
a
piece
of
sheep
wool
a
man
and
his
wife
would
be
represented
by
two
tubes
and
if
he
had
two
wives
an
extra
tube
would
be
placed
in
the
at
the
ceremony
of
consecration
the
pehmo
attends
and
a
slave
is
set
apart
for
the
purpose
of
attending
to
all
the
rites
connected
with
the
worship
of
the
deceased
person
the

sometimes
placed
in
the
house
but
more
often
on
a
tree
in
the
neighborhood
or
it
may
be
hidden
in
a
rock

persons
who
are

placed
in
a
crevice

ruined

three
years
the

changed
and
the
old
one
burnt
the
term
by
which
the
are
generally
known
is
a
contemptuous
nickname
given
them
by
the
chinese
in
reference
to
this
peculiar
method
of
venerating
their
ancestors
hill
worship
is
another
important
feature
of
religious
life
most
important
houses
are
built
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
and
sacrifice
is
regularly
offered
on
the
in
the
fourth
month
of
each
year
the
pehmo
determines
which
is
the
most
propitious
day
and
the
tumuh
and
his
people
proceed
to
the
appointed
spot
a
limestone
rock
with
an
old
tree
trunk
near
is
chosen
as
an
altar
and
a
sheep
and
pig
are
brought
forward
by
the
tumuh
the
pehmo
having
adjusted
his
clothes
sits
before
the
altar
and
begins
intoning
his
incantations
in
a
low
muttering
voice
the
sacrifice
is
then
slain
and
the
blood
poured
beneath
the
altar
and
a
handful
of
rice
and
a
lump
of
salt
are
placed
beneath
the
stone
some
person
then
gathers
a
bundle
of
green
grass
and
the
pehmo
having
finished
intoning
the
altar
is
covered
and
all
return
to
the
house
the
pehmo
then
twists
the
grass
into
a
length
of
rope
which
he
hangs
over
the
doorway
of
the
house
out
of
a
piece
of
willow
a
small
arrow
is
made
and
a
bow
similar
in
size
is
cut
out
of
a

these
are
placed
on
the
doorposts
on
a
piece
of
soft
white
wood
a
figure
of
a
man
is
roughly
carved
and
this
with
two
sticks
of

placed
is
fastened
to
the
rope
hanging
over
the
doorway
on
each
side
of
which
two
small
sticks
are
placed
the
pehmo
then
proceeds
with
his
incantation
muttering
now
henceforth
and
for
ever
will
the
evil
spirits
keep
away
from
this
house

at
the

on

was

all
the
world
seemed
buttoned
up
and
the
trees
seemed
wiry
and
cheerless
the
legs
of
the
seemed
brittle
and
i
felt
so
breath
issued
visibly
from
the
mouth
as
i
trudged
along
my
boy
and
i
nearly
came
to
blows
in
the
early
morning
i
wanted
to
lie
on
he
did
not
if
he
could
not
entertain
himself
for
half
an
hour
with
his
own
thoughts
i
who
could
thought
it
no
fault
of
mine
i
was
a
reasoning
being
a
rational
creature
and
thought
it
a
fine
way
of
spending
a
sensible
impartial
but
i
had
to
get
up
and
then
came
the
benumbed
fingers
a
quivering
body
a
frozen
towel
and
a
floor
upon
which
the
mud
was
frozen
stiff
little
did
he
know
that
he
was
pulling
me
out
to
the
most
eventful
and
unfortunate
day
of
my
trip
at
i
had
bought
a
pony
in
case
of
emergency
one
of
those
sturdy
little
brutes
that
never
grow
tired
cost
little
to
keep
and
are
unexcelled
for
the
amount
of
work
they
can
get
through
every
day
in
the
week
its
color
was
black
a
smooth
glossy
black
the
proverbial
dark
horse
and
when
dressed
in
its
english
saddle
and
bridle
looked
even
smart
enough
for
the
use
of
the
distinguished
traveler
who
smiled
the
smile
of
pleasant
ownership
as
it
was
led
on
in
front
all
day
long
seeming
to
return
a
satanic
grin
for
my
foolishness
at
not
riding
it
u
the
first
i
saw
of
it
was
when
it
was
standing
full
on
its
hind
legs
pinning
a
man
between
the
railings
and
a
wall
in
a
corner
of
the
mission
premises
it
looked
well
truly
it
was
a
blood
beast
on
the
second
day
out
whilst
walking
merrily
along
in
the
early
morning
the
little
brute
lifted
its
heels
lodged
them
most
precisely
on
to
my
right
forearm
with
considerable
force
more
forceful
than
affectionate
sending
the
stick
which
i
carried
thirty
feet
from
me
up
the
cliffs
the
limb
ached
and
i
felt
sick
my
boy
he
had
been
a
doctor
boy
on
one
of
the
gunboats
at
thought
it
was
bruised
i
acquiesced
and
sank
fainting
to
a
stone
on
the
strength
of
my
boy
diagnosis
we
rubbed
it
and
found
that
it
hurt
still
more
then
diving
into
a
cottage
i
brought
out
a
piece
of
wood
three
inches
wide
and
twenty
inches
long
placed
my
arm
on
it
bade
my
boy
take
off
one
of
my
puttees
from
one
of
my
legs
used
it
as
a
bandage
and
trudged
on
again
not
realizing
that
my
arm
was
broken
in
the
evening
i
determined
to
chastise
the
animal
in
a
manner
becoming
to
my
disgust
mounting
at
the
foot
of
a
long
hill
i
laid
on
the
stick
as
hard
as
i
could
and
found
that
my
pony
had
a
remarkable
turn
of
speed
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
was
a
dip
at
the
base
of
which
was
a
pond
down
down
down
we
went
and
despite
my
full
strength
with
the
left
arm
at
its
mouth
the
pony
plunged
in
with
a
dull
splash
only
to
find
that
his
feet
gave
way
under
him
in
a
clay
bottom
he
could
not
free
himself
to
swim
farther
and
farther
we
sank
together
every
second
deeper
into
the
mire
when
just
at
the
moment
i
felt
the
mud
clinging
about
my
waist
and
i
had
visions
of
a
horrible
death
away
from
all
who
knew
me
i
plunged
madly
to
reach
the
side
with
one
arm
useless
it
is
still
to
me
the
one
great
wonder
of
my
life
how
i
escaped
nothing
short
of
miraculous
one
of
the
times
when
one
feels
a
special
protection
of
providence
surrounding
him
pulling
the
beast
head
after
i
had
given
myself
a
momentary
shake
i
succeeded
in
making
him
give
a
mighty
lurch
then
another
then
another
and
in
a
few
seconds
after
terrible
struggling
he
reached
the
bank
we
made
a
sorry
spectacle
as
we
walked
shamefacedly
back
to
the
inn
under
the
gaze
of
half
a
dozen
grinning
rustics
where
my
man
was
preparing
the
evening
meal
in
the
evening
on
the
advice
of
my
general
confidential
companion
i
submitted
to
a
poultice
being
applied
to
my
arm
it
was
bruised
so
we
put
on
the
poultice
of
bread
whilst
it
was
hot
it
was
comfortable
when
it
was
cold
i
unrolled
the
bandage
threw
the
poultice
to
the
floor
and
in
two
minutes
saw
glistening
in
the
moonlight
the
eyes
of
the
rats
which
ate
it
then
i
bade
sweet
morpheus
take
me
but
although
the
pain
prevented
me
from
sleeping
i
remember
fainting
how
long
i
lay
i
know
not
shuddering
in
every
limb
with
pain
and
chilly
fear
i
at
length
awoke
from
a
long
swoon
something
had
happened
but
what
there
was
still
the
paper
window
the
same
greasy
saucer
of
thick
oil
and
light
being
given
by
the
same
rush
the
same
rickety
table
the
same
chair
on
which
we
had
made
the
poultice
but
what
had
happened
i
rubbed
my
aching
eyes
and
lifted
myself
in
a
posture
a
dream
had
dazzled
me
and
scared
my
senses
and
then
i
knew
that
it
was
malaria
coming
on
again
and
that
i
was
once
more
her
luckless
victim
malignant
malaria
mistress
of
men
who
court
thee
under
tropic
skies
and
who
like
me
are
turned
from
thee
bodily
shattered
and
whimpering
like
a
child
how
much
how
very
much
hast
thou
laid
up
for
thyself
in
hades
thank
heaven
i
had
superabundant
energy
and
vitality
and
despite
contorted
and
distorted
things
dancing
haphazard
through
my
fevered
brain
i
determined
not
to
go
under
not
to
give
in
my
mind
was
a
terrible
tangle
of
combinations
nevertheless
intricate
incongruous
inconsequent
monstrous
but
still
i
plodded
on
for
the
next
four
days
with
my
arm
lying
limp
and
lifeless
at
my
side
and
with
recurring
attacks
of
malaria
i
walked
on
against
the
greatest
odds
and
it
was
not
till
i
had
reached
that
i
learnt
that
the
limb
was
fractured
men
may
have
seen
more
in
four
days
and
done
more
and
risked
more
but
i
think
few
travelers
have
been
called
upon
to
suffer
more
agony
than
befell
the
lot
of
the
man
who
was
crossing
china
on
foot
from
there
is
a
stiff
ascent
followed
by
a
climb
up
steep
stone
steps
and
muddy
mountain
banks
through
black
and
barren
country
the
morning
had
been
cold
and
frosty
but
rain
came
on
later
a
thick
heavy
deluge
which
swished
and
swashed
everything
from
its
path
as
one
toiled
painfully
up
those
slippery
paths
made
almost
unnegotiable
but
my
imagination
and
my
hope
helped
me
to
make
my
own
sunshine
there
is
something
i
think
not
disagreeable
in
issuing
forth
during
a
good
honest
summer
rain
at
home
with
a
burberry
well
buttoned
and
an
umbrella
over
one
head
here
in
a
coat
made
it
too
uncomfortable
to
walk
and
the
terrific
wind
would
have
blown
an
umbrella
from
grasp
in
a
twinkling
if
we
are
in
the
home
humor
in
the
summer
we
do
not
mind
how
drenching
the
rain
is
and
we
may
even
take
delight
in
getting
our
own
legs
splashed
as
we
glance
at
the
very
touching
stockings
and
the
very
gentle
and
sensitive
legs
of
other
weaker
ones
in
the
same
plight
but
here
was
i
in
a
gale
on
the
bleakest
tableland
one
can
find
in
this
part
of
and
a
sorry
sight
truly
did
i
make
as
i
trudged
two
steps
forward
one
step
back
in
my
bare
feet
covered
only
with
rough
straw
sandals
with
trousers
upturned
above
the
knee
with
teeth
chattering
in
malarial
shivers
endeavoring
to
think
of
the
pouring
deluge
as
a
benignant
enemy
fertilizing
fields
purifying
the
streets
of
the
horrid
little
villages
in
which
we
spent
our
nights
refreshing
the
air
shall
i
ever
forget
the
day
just
before
sundown
drenched
to
the
skin
and
suffering
horribly
from
the
blues
we
reached
one
single
hut
which
i
could
justly
look
upon
as
a
sort
of
evening
companion
for
here
was
a
fire
albeit
a
green
wood
fire
which
looked
gladly
in
my
face
talked
to
me
and
put
life
and
comfort
and
warmth
into
me
for
the
ten
li
yet
remaining
of
the
hard
journey
and
at
night
about
we
at
last
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
actually
the
summit
of
a
mountain
pass
at
the
dirty
little
village
of
not
for
long
however
could
i
rest
for
i
heard
yells
and
screams
and
laughs
that
pony
again
every
one
of
my
men
were
afraid
of
it
for
at
the
slightest
invitation
it
pawed
with
its
front
feet
and
landed
man
after
man
into
the
gutter
and
if
that
failed
it
stood
upright
and
cuddled
them
around
the
neck
now
i
found
it
had
run
saddle
bridle
and
all
and
none
volunteered
to
chase
so
at
weary
and
bearing
the
burden
of
a
terrible
day
which
laid
the
foundation
of
a
long
illness
to
be
recorded
later
i
found
it
my
unpleasant
duty
to
patrol
the
hill
from
top
to
bottom
lighting
my
slippery
way
with
a
chinese
lantern
chasing
the
pony
silhouetted
on
the
is
a
dreary
spot
with
no
inn
accommodation
at
all
v
a
place
depopulated
and
laid
waste
gloomy
and
melancholy
i
managed
however
after
promising
a
big
fee
to
get
into
a
small
where
the
people
were
not
unkindly
disposed
i
ate
my
food
slept
as
much
as
i
could
in
the
few
hours
before
the
appearing
of
the
earliest
dawn
on
the
bench
allotted
to
me
feeling
thankful
that
to
me
had
been
allowed
even
this
scanty
lodging
but
i
could
not
conscientiously
recommend
the
place
to
future
travelers
a
dirty
little
village
with
its
dirty
people
and
its
dirty
atmosphere
at
the
top
of
the
pass
the
wind
nearly
removed
my
ears
as
i
took
a
final
glance
at
the
mountain
refuge
mountains
here
run
and
and
are
grand
to
look
upon
the
poorest
people
were
lepers
the
beggars
were
all
dead
long
ago
in
province
leprosy
afflicts
thousands
a
disease
which
the
chinese
not
without
reason
dread
terribly
for
no
known
remedy
exists
burning
the
patient
alive
which
used
often
to
be
resorted
to
is
even
now
looked
upon
as
the
only
true
remedy
cases
have
been
known
where
the
patient
having
been
stupefied
with
opium
has
been
locked
in
a
house
which
has
then
been
set
on
fire
and
its
inmate
cremated
on
the
spot
mining
used
to
be
carried
on
here
so
they
told
me
but
i
was
not
long
in
concluding
that
whatever
was
the
product
it
has
not
materially
affected
the
world
output
nor
had
it
greatly
enriched
the
laborers
in
the
field
when
i
got
into
civilization
i
found
that
coal
of
a
sulphurous
nature
was
the
booty
of
ancient
days
there
may
be
coal
yet
as
is
most
probable
but
the
natives
seemed
far
too
apathetic
and
weary
of
life
to
care
whether
it
is
there
or
not
passing
the
descent
narrows
to
a
splendid
view
of
dark
mountain
and
green
and
beautiful
valley
we
were
now
traveling
away
from
several
ranges
of
lofty
mountains
whose
peaks
appeared
vividly
above
the
drooping
clouds
onwards
to
a
range
immediately
opposite
up
whose
slopes
we
toiled
all
day
passing
only
one
uninhabited
hamlet
to
which
the
people
flee
in
time
of
trouble
after
a
weary
tramp
of
another
li
the
li
mind
you
the
most
unreliable
quantity
in
all
matters
geographical
in
the
country
i
asked
irritatedly
as
all
travelers
must
have
asked
before
me
then
in
the
name
of
heaven
where
is
w
it
should
come
into
view
behind
the
terrible
steep
decline
when
one
is
within
only
about
a
hundred
yards
it
is
roughly
four
thousand
feet
below
is
an
important
stopping
place
with
but
one
forlorn
street
with
two
or
three
forlorn
inns
the
best
of
which
has
its
best
room
immediately
over
the
filthiest
stables
emitting
a
stench
which
was
almost
unbearable
that
i
have
seen
in
china
it
literally
suffocates
one
as
it
comes
up
in
wafts
through
the
wide
gaps
in
the
wood
floor
of
the
room
there
are
no
mosquitoes
here
but
of
a
certain
winged
insect
of
various
species
whose
distinguishing
characteristics
are
that
the
wings
are
transparent
and
have
no
cases
or
covers
there
was
a
formidable
army
i
refer
to
the
common
little
fly
there
was
the
house
fly
the
horse
fly
the
dangerous
the
impecunious
blow
fly
the
indefatigable
buzzer
and
others
one
delicate
skin
got
beset
with
flies
they
got
in
one
ears
in
one
eyes
up
one
nose
down
throat
in
one
coffee
in
one
bed
they
bade
fair
to
devour
one
within
an
hour
or
two
and
brought
forth
inward
curses
and
many
swishes
of
the
the
village
seemed
a
glancing
comprehensively
at
one
another
as
i
entered
the
higher
end
of
the
town
a
party
of
reveling
hastily
pulled
some
cash
from
their
satchels
to
settle
accounts
and
made
a
general
rush
into
the
street
where
they
awaited
noisily
the
approach
of
a
strangely
wondrous
and
imposing
spectacle
one
that
had
not
been
seen
in
those
parts
for
many
days
the
tramper
tired
as
he
could
be
at
length
approached
but
the
crowd
had
increased
so
enormously
that
the
road
was
completely
blocked
tradesmen
with
their
portable
workshops
pedlars
with
their
cumbersome
gear
and
could
not
pass
but
had
to
wait
for
their
turn
there
were
not
even
any
tortuous
in
this
place
whereby
they
might
reach
their
destination
children
lost
themselves
in
the
crush
and
went
about
crying
for
their
mothers
a
party
of
travelers
newly
arrived
from
the
south
by
caravan
route
got
wedged
with
their
horses
and
mules
in
the
thick
of
the
mob
and
could
not
move
an
inch
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
throng
heaved
restlessly
to
and
fro
under
the
blaze
of
the
brilliant
sun
which
harassed
everyone
in
the
valley
and
moving
slowly
and
majestically
in
the
midst
of
them
all
came
the
foreigner
as
they
caught
sight
of
me
my
sandalled
feet
and
the
retinue
following
on
wearily
in
the
wake
the
populace
set
up
an
ecstatic
yell
of
ferocious
applause
and
turned
their
faces
towards
the
inn
in
the
doorway
of
which
one
of
my
was
holding
forth
on
points
of
more
or
less
delicacy
respecting
my
good
or
bad
nature
and
my
british
connection
at
that
moment
the
huge
human
mass
began
to
move
in
one
predetermined
direction
and
then
a
couple
of
mandarins
in
their
chairs
joined
the
swarming
rabble
i
had
to
sit
down
on
the
step
for
five
minutes
whilst
my
boy
with
commendable
energy
cleared
these
two
mandarins
who
had
come
from
and
were
on
their
way
to
the
capital
out
of
the
best
room
because
his
master
wanted
it
as
he
finished
speaking
there
came
a
loud
crashing
noise
and
a
shout
my
pony
had
landed
out
just
once
again
and
banged
in
one
side
of
a
chair
belonging
to
these
traveling
officials
they
met
me
with
noisy
and
derisive
greetings
which
were
returned
with
a
straight
and
penetrating
look
no
less
than
fifty
degrees
was
the
thermometrical
difference
in
and
here
it
was
stifling
cattle
stood
in
stagnant
water
ducks
were
envied
my
room
with
the
sun
on
it
became
intolerable
and
i
sought
refuge
by
the
river
my
butter
was
too
liquid
to
spread
coolies
were
tired
as
they
rested
outside
the
having
not
a
cash
to
spend
my
pony
stood
wincing
giving
sharp
shivers
to
his
skin
and
moving
his
tail
to
clear
off
the
flies
and
his
hind
legs
to
clear
off
men
as
for
myself
i
could
have
done
with
an
iced
soda
or
a
claret
cup
very
early
in
the
morning
despite
malaria
shivers
i
made
my
way
over
the
beautiful
suspension
bridge
which
here
graces
the
niu
lan
x
a
tributary
of
the
yangtze
up
to
the
high
hills
beyond
this
bridge
at
is
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
by
twelve
protected
at
one
end
by
a
couple
of
monkeys
carved
in
stone
whilst
the
opposite
end
is
guarded
by
what
are
supposed
to
be
i
believe
a
couple
of
lions
and
not
a
bad
representation
of
them
either
seeing
that
the
workmen
had
no
original
near
at
hand
to
go
by
from
here
the
ascent
over
a
second
range
of
mountains
is
made
by
tortuous
paths
that
wind
along
the
sides
of
the
hills
high
above
the
stream
below
and
at
other
times
along
the
the
river
is
followed
in
a
steep
ascent
a
sort
of
climbing
terrace
from
which
the
water
leaps
in
delightful
cascades
and
waterfalls
a
climb
brings
one
after
terrific
labor
to
the
mouth
of
the
picturesque
pass
of
at
feet
in
the
quiet
of
the
mountains
i
took
my
midday
meal
there
was
about
the
place
an
stillness
it
was
grand
but
lonely
weird
rather
than
peaceful
so
that
one
was
glad
to
descend
again
suddenly
to
the
river
tracing
it
through
long
stretches
of
plain
and
barren
valley
after
which
narrow
paths
lead
up
again
to
the
small
village
of
considerably
below
it
is
the
sudden
descents
and
ascents
which
astonish
one
in
traveling
in
this
region
and
whether
climbing
or
dropping
one
always
reaches
a
plain
or
upland
which
would
delude
one
into
believing
that
he
is
almost
at
were
it
not
for
the
towering
mountains
that
all
around
keep
one
hemmed
in
in
a
silent
stillness
and
the
rarefied
air
for
instance
standing
at
this
altitude
of
considerably
over
feet
is
in
the
center
of
a
tableland
on
which
are
numerous
villages
around
which
the
fragrance
of
the
broad
bean
in
flower
and
the
splendid
fertility
now
and
again
met
with
makes
it
extremely
pleasant
to
walk
it
is
almost
a
series
of
english
cottage
gardens
here
the
weather
was
like
july
in
england
or
what
one
likes
to
imagine
july
should
be
in
england
dumb
dreaming
hot
lazy
luxurious
weather
in
which
one
should
do
as
he
pleases
and
be
pleased
with
what
he
does
as
i
toiled
along
my
useless
limb
causing
me
each
day
more
trouble
i
felt
i
should
like
to
lie
down
on
the
grass
with
stones
head
and
shoulders
for
my
pillow
and
repose
as
nature
was
reposing
in
sovereign
strength
but
i
was
getting
weaker
i
saw
as
i
passed
gardens
of
purple
and
gold
and
white
splendor
the
sky
was
at
its
bluest
the
clouds
were
full
snowy
mountainous
then
on
again
to
varying
scenes
inns
were
not
frequent
and
were
poor
and
wretched
the
country
was
all
red
sandstone
and
devoid
of
all
timber
till
descending
into
a
lovely
valley
the
path
crossed
an
obstructing
ridge
and
then
led
out
into
a
beautiful
park
all
green
and
sweet
the
country
was
full
of
color
it
put
a
good
taste
in
one
mouth
it
impressed
one
as
a
means
of
keeping
one
cheerful
in
sad
dilemma
the
gardens
the
fields
the
skies
the
mountains
the
sunset
the
light
itself
all
were
full
of
color
and
earth
and
heaven
seemed
of
one
opinion
in
the
harmony
of
the
reds
the
purples
the
drabs
the
blacks
the
browns
the
bright
blues
and
the
yellows
birds
were
as
tame
as
they
were
in
the
great
beginning
they
came
under
the
table
as
i
ate
and
picked
up
the
crumbs
without
fear
peasant
people
sat
under
great
cedars
planted
to
give
shade
to
the
travelers
and
bade
one
feel
at
home
in
his
lonely
pilgrimage
then
one
felt
a
peculiar
feeling
this
feeling
will
arise
in
any
traveler
when
surmounting
some
hill
range
in
the
desert
road
one
descries
lying
far
below
embosomed
in
its
natural
bulwarks
the
fair
village
the
the
little
of
men
where
one
is
to
sleep
but
when
towards
nightfall
as
the
good
red
sun
went
down
i
was
led
weary
and
into
one
of
the
worst
inns
it
had
been
my
misfortune
to
encounter
a
thousand
other
thoughts
and
feelings
united
in
common
anathema
to
the
unenterprising
community
tea
was
bad
rice
we
could
not
get
and
all
night
long
the
detestable
smells
from
the
wood
fires
choked
our
throats
and
blinded
our
eyes
glad
therefore
was
i
despite
the
heavy
rain
to
take
a
hurried
and
early
departure
the
next
morning
descending
a
thousand
feet
to
a
river
rising
quite
as
suddenly
to
a
height
of
feet
now
the
road
went
over
a
mountain
broad
and
flat
where
traveling
in
the
sun
was
extremely
pleasant
or
rather
would
have
been
had
i
been
fit
laden
clumsily
with
their
heavy
loads
of
puerh
tea
manchester
goods
oil
and
native
exports
from
province
passed
us
on
the
and
sometimes
numbers
of
these
willing
but
animals
were
seen
grazing
in
the
hollows
by
the
wayside
their
backs
in
almost
every
instance
cruelly
lacerated
by
the
continuous
rubbing
of
the
wooden
frames
on
which
their
loads
were
strapped
for
cruelty
to
animals
china
stands
an
easy
first
love
of
animals
does
not
enter
into
their
sympathies
at
all
i
found
this
not
to
be
the
case
among
the
miao
and
the
however
and
the
tribes
across
the
yangtze
below
locally
called
the
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
fond
of
horses
and
some
of
them
capable
horsemen
the
journey
across
these
mountains
has
no
perils
one
may
step
aside
a
few
feet
with
no
fear
of
falling
a
few
thousand
a
danger
so
common
in
most
of
the
country
from
downwards
the
scenery
is
magnificent
range
after
range
of
mountains
in
whatever
direction
you
look
nothing
but
mountains
of
varying
altitudes
and
the
patches
of
wooded
slopes
alternating
with
the
red
earth
and
more
fertile
green
plots
through
which
streams
flow
with
rolling
waterfalls
picturesque
nooks
and
winding
pathways
make

only

do
justice

one
is

spellbound
by
the

beauty
of
this

one
wonders
what
all
this
grand
scenery
untouched
and
unmarred
by
the
hand
of
man
would
become
were
it
in
the
center

constantly

seven

nine

my
journey
continuing
across
more

brought
me
at

to
red

a
tiny
hamlet
hidden
away
completely
in
a
deep
recess
in
the
settled
in
a
narrow
gorge
the
first
house
of
which
can
not
be
seen
until
within
a
few
yards
of
entry
inn
accommodation
as
was
usual
was
by
no
means
good
it
is
characteristic
of
these
small
places
that
the
greater
the
traffic
the
worse
invariably
is
the
accommodation
offered
travelers
are
continually
staying
here
but
not
one
chinese
in
the
population
is
enterprising
enough
to
open
a
decent
inn
they
have
no
money
to
start
it
i
suppose
but
it
is
true
of
the
chinese
to
a
greater
degree
than
of
any
other
nation
that
their
golden
age
is
in
the
past
sages
of
antiquity
spoke
with
deep
reverence
of
the
more
ancient
ancients
of
the
ages
and
revered
all
that
they
said
and
did
and
the
rural
chinese
says
that
what
did
for
the
sages
of
olden
times
must
do
for
him
the
conservative
instinct
leads
the
chinese
to
attach
undue
importance
to
precedent
and
therefore
the
people
at
knowing
that
the
village
has
been
in
the
same
pitiable
condition
for
generations
live
by
conservatism
and
make
no
effort
whatever
to
improve
matters
fire
in
the
inn
was
kindled
in
the
hollow
of
the
ground
there
was
no
ventilation
the
wood
they
burned
was
as
usual
green
smoke
was
suffocating
my
men
talked
well
on
into
the
night
and
kept
me
from
sleeping
even
if
pain
would
have
allowed
me
to
i
spoke
strongly
and
they
thinking
i
was
swearing
at
them
desisted
for
fear
that
i
should
heap
upon
their
ancestors
a
few
of
the
reviling
thoughts
i
entertained
for
them
i
should
like
to
say
a
word
here
about
the
roads
in
this
province
or
perhaps
the
absence
of
roads
they
had
been
execrable
the
worst
i
had
met
aggravated
by
heavy
rains
with
all
the
reforms
to
which
the
province
of
is
endeavoring
to
direct
its
energies
it
has
not
yet
learned
that
one
of
the
first
assets
of
any
district
or
country
is
good
roads
but
this
is
true
of
the
whole
of
the
middle
kingdom
the
contracted
quarters
in
which
the
chinese
live
compel
them
to
do
most
of
their
work
in
the
street
and
even
in
a
city
provided
with
but
the
narrowest
passages
these
slender
avenues
are
perpetually
choked
by
the
presence
of
peripatetic
vendors
of
every
kind
of
article
of
common
sale
in
china
and
by
itinerant
craftsmen
who
have
no
other
shop
than
the
street
in
the
capital
city
of
the
province
even
it
is
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
to
the
european
to
walk
down
the
street
after
a
shower
of
rain
so
slippery
do
the
slabs
of
stone
become
and
he
has
to
be
alive
always
to
the
lumbering
carts
whose
wheels
are
more
solid
than
circular
pulled
by
bullocks
as
in
the
days
long
before
the
dawn
of
the
christian
era
the
wider
the
chinese
street
the
more
abuses
can
it
be
put
to
so
that
travel
in
the
broad
streets
of
the
towns
is
quite
as
difficult
as
in
the
narrow
alleys
and
as
these
streets
are
never
repaired
or
very
rarely
they
become
worse
than
no
roads
at
all
that
is
in
dry
weather
this
refers
to
the
paved
road
which
no
matter
what
its
faults
is
certainly
passable
and
in
wet
weather
is
a
boon
there
is
however
another
kind
of
road
a
mud
road
and
with
a
vengeance
muddy
an
ordinary
mud
or
earth
road
is
usually
only
wide
enough
for
a
couple
of
coolies
to
pass
and
in
this
province
as
it
is
often
necessary
especially
in
the
district
for
one
cart
to
pass
another
the
farmer
to
prevent
trespass
on
his
crops
digs
around
them
deep
ditches
resembling
those
which
are
dug
for
the
reception
of
gas
mains
in
the
rainy
season
the
fields
are
drained
into
the
roads
which
at
times
are
constantly
under
water
and
beyond
on
my
way
to
i
often
found
it
easier
and
more
speedy
to
tramp
bang
across
a
rice
field
taking
no
notice
of
where
the
road
ought
to
be
by
the
time
the
road
has
sunk
a
few
feet
below
the
level
of
the
adjacent
land
it
is
liable
to
be
absolutely
useless
as
a
thoroughfare
it
is
actually
a
canal
but
can
be
neither
navigated
nor
crossed
there
are
some
roads
removed
a
little
from
the
main
roads
which
are
quite
dangerous
and
it
is
not
by
any
means
an
uncommon
thing
to
hear
of
men
with
their
loads
being
washed
away
by
rivers
where
in
the
dry
season
there
had
been
the
roads
the
great
lines
of
chinese
travel
so
often
impassable
might
be
made
permanently
passable
if
the
governor
of
a
province
chose
to
compel
the
several
district
magistrates
along
the
line
to
see
that
these
important
arteries
are
kept
free
from
standing
water
with
ditches
in
good
order
at
all
seasons
but
for
the
village
roads
during
my
travels
over
which
i
have
come
across
very
few
that
could
from
a
western
standpoint
be
called
roads
there
is
absolutely
no
hope
until
such
time
as
the
chinese
village
may
come
dimly
to
the
apprehension
that
what
is
for
the
advantage
of
the
one
is
for
the
advantage
of
all
and
that
wise
expenditure
is
the
truest
economy
an
idea
of
which
it
has
at
the
present
moment
as
little
conception
as
of
the
average
thought
of
the
englishman
a
hundred
li
to
the
east
of
over
two
impassable
mountain
ranges
are
some
considerable
mines
with
antiquated
brass
and
copper
smelting
works
and
this
place
by
name
with
forms
an
important
center
as
is
well
known
all
copper
of
goes
to
peking
as
the
government
monopoly
excepting
the
enormous
amount
stolen
and
smuggled
into
every
town
in
the
province
y
the
smelting
is
of
the
roughest
though
they
are
at
the
present
moment
laying
in
english
machinery
and
the
chinese
in
charge
is
under
the
impression
that
he
can
speak
english
he
however
makes
a
hopeless
jargon
of
it
this
mining
locality
is
sunk
in
the
deepest
degradation
men
and
women
live
more
as
wild
beasts
than
as
human
beings
and
should
any
be
unfortunate
enough
to
die
their
corpses
are
allowed
to
lie
in
the
mines
who
is
there
that
could
give
his
time
and
energy
to
the
removal
of
a
dead
man
should
become
an
important
town
if
the
rich
mineral
country
of
which
it
is
the
pivot
were
properly
opened
up
several
times
i
have
visited
the
works
in
this
city
which
under
the
charge
of
a
small
mandarin
from
can
boast
only
the
most
primitive
and
inadequate
machinery
of
german
make
a
huge
engine
was
running
as
a
kind
of
pump
for
the
accumulation
of
air
which
was
passed
through
a
long
thin
pipe
to
the
three
furnaces
in
the
outer
courtyard
the
furnaces
were
and
were
fed
with
charcoal
the
most
expensive
fuel
in
the
district
the
maximum
of
pure
metal
being
only
catties
per
day
the
ore
which
has
been
roughly
smelted
once
is
brought
from
is
finely
smelted
here
then
conveyed
most
of
the
way
to
peking
by
the
expense
in
thus
handling
from
the
time
it
leaves
the
mine
to
its
destination
at
peking
being
several
times
its
market
value
nothing
but
copper
is
sought
from
the
ore
and
a
good
deal
of
the
gold
and
silver
known
to
be
contained
is
lost
i
passed
an
old
french
priest
as
i
was
going
to
the
next
day
he
was
very
pleased
to
see
me
and
at
a
small
place
we
had
a
few
minutes
chat
whilst
we
sipped
our
tea
in
i
found
that
the
protestants
and
the
romanists
although
seeing
very
little
of
each
other
went
their
own
way
maintaining
an
attitude
of
more
or
less
friendly
indifference
one
towards
the
other
the
last
day
march
to
is
perhaps
the
most
interesting
of
this
stage
of
my
journey
climbing
over
boulders
and
stony
steps
i
reached
an
altitude
of
feet
whence
thirty
li
of
pleasant
going
awaited
us
all
the
way
to
temple
of
the
dragon
king
here
i
sat
down
and
strained
my
eyes
to
catch
the
glimpse
of
the
compact
little
walled
city
where
i
hoped
my
broken
arm
would
be
set
by
the
european
missionaries
the
traveler
invariably
hastens
his
pace
here
expecting
to
run
down
the
hill
and
across
the
plain
in
a
very
short
space
but
as
the
time
passed
and
i
slowly
wended
my
way
along
the
difficult
paths
through
the
rice
fields
i
began
to
realize
that
i
had
been
duped
and
that
it
was
farther
than
it
seemed
two
blushing
damsels
maids
goodly
to
look
upon
gave
me
the
sweetest
of
smiles
as
i
strode
across
the
bodies
of
some
fat
pigs
which
roamed
at
large
in
the
outskirts
of
the
city
the
only
remembrance
i
have
to
mar
the
cleanliness
of
the
place
at
the
rev
evans
and
his
extremely
hospitable
wife
set
my
arm
and
did
everything
they
could
as
much
as
a
brother
and
sister
could
have
done
to
help
me
and
to
make
my
short
stay
with
them
a
most
happy
remembrance
it
was
however
destined
that
i
should
be
their
guest
for
many
months
as
shall
hereinafter
be
explained
a
trio
of
europeans
might
have
been
seen
on
the
morning
of
monday
may
leaving
on
the
road
to
whither
the
author
was
bound
and
evans
who
as
chance
would
have
it
were
going
to
were
to
accompany
me
for
two
days
before
turning
off
in
a
southerly
direction
when
leaving
the
prefecture
it
was
a
fine
spring
morning
balmy
and
bonny
it
was
decided
that
i
should
ride
a
pony
and
this
i
did
abandoning
my
purpose
of
crossing
china
on
foot
with
some
regret
i
was
not
yet
fit
had
my
broken
arm
in
splints
but
rejoiced
that
at
i
should
be
able
to
consult
a
european
medical
man
comparatively
an
unproductive
task
and
perhaps
a
false
and
impossible
one
would
it
be
for
me
to
detail
the
happenings
of
the
few
days
next
ensuing
i
should
be
able
not
to
look
at
things
themselves
but
merely
at
the
shadow
of
things
and
it
would
serve
no
profitable
end
suffice
it
to
say
that
two
days
out
about
midday
a
special
messenger
from
the
capital
stopped
evans
and
handed
him
a
letter
it
was
to
tell
him
that
his
going
to
would
be
of
no
use
as
the
gentleman
he
was
on
his
way
to
meet
would
not
arrive
owing
to
altered
plans
after
consulting
his
wife
he
hesitated
whether
they
should
go
back
to
or
come
on
to
the
capital
with
me
the
latter
course
was
decided
upon
as
i
was
so
far
from
well
i
learned
this
some
time
afterwards
and
now
the
story
need
not
be
lengthened
at
see
first
section
of
the
second
book
of
this
volume
malaria
came
back
and
an
abnormal
temperature
made
me
delirious
the
following
day
i
could
not
move
and
it
was
not
until
i
had
been
there
six
days
that
i
was
again
able
to
be
moved
during
this
time
and
evans
nursed
me
day
and
night
relieving
each
other
for
rest
in
a
terrible
chinese
inn
not
a
single
moment
did
they
leave
me
the
third
day
they
feared
i
was
dying
and
a
message
to
that
effect
was
sent
to
the
capital
informing
the
consul
meanwhile
malaria
played
fast
and
loose
and
promised
a
pitiable
early
dissolution
my
kind
devoted
friends
were
fearful
lest
the
innkeeper
would
have
turned
me
out
into
the
roadway
to
die
the
foreigner
spirit
would
haunt
the
place
for
ever
and
a
day
were
i
allowed
to
die
inside
but
i
recovered
it
was
a
graver
older
less
exuberant
walker
across
china
that
presently
arose
from
his
bed
of
sickness
and
began
to
make
a
languid
personal
introspection
i
had
developed
a
new
sensitiveness
the
sensitiveness
of
an
alien
in
an
alien
land
in
the
hands
of
faithful
friends
without
them
i
should
have
been
a
waif
of
all
the
world
helpless
in
the
midst
of
unconquerable
surroundings
leading
to
an
inevitable
destiny
of
death
i
seemed
declimatized
denationalized
a
luckless
victim
of
fate
and
morbid
fancy
it
was
malaria
and
her
workings
from
which
there
was
no
escape
malaria
is
supposed
by
the
natives
of
the
tropic
belt
to
be
sent
to
europeans
by
providence
as
a
chastening
for
the
otherwise
insupportable
energy
of
the
white
man
malignant
malaria
is
one
of
set
to
guard
her
shrine
of
peace
and
ease
and
to
punish
woeful
intruders
and
she
had
brought
me
to
china
to
punish
me
as
is
her
wont
nature
milked
the
manhood
out
of
me
racked
me
with
aches
and
pains
shattered
me
with
chills
scorched
me
with
fever
fires
pursued
me
with
despairing
visions
and
me
without
mercy
accursed
newspapers
with
their
accursed
routine
came
back
to
me
all
the
stories
and
legends
that
i
had
ever
heard
all
the
facts
that
i
had
ever
learnt
came
to
me
in
a
fashion
wonderfully
contorted
and
distorted
sensations
welded
together
in
ghastly
conglomerates
instinct
with
individuality
and
personality
human
but
torturingly
inhuman
crowded
in
upon
me
the
barriers
dividing
the
world
of
ideas
sensations
and
realities
seemed
to
have
been
thrown
down
and
all
rushed
into
my
brain
like
a
set
of
hungry
foxhounds
the
horror
of
effort
and
the
futility
of
endeavor
permeated
my
very
soul
my
weary
helpless
brain
was
filled
with
hordes
of
unruly
imaginings
i
was
masterless
maddened
and
had
to
abide
for
weeks
yea
months
with
a
soul
occupying
a
and
weakened
body
at
whither
i
arrived
in
due
course
after
considerable
struggling
dysentery
laid
me
up
again
and
threatened
to
pull
me
nearer
to
the
last
great
brink
for
weeks
as
the
guest
of
my
friend
fleischmann
i
stayed
here
recuperating
and
subsequently
on
the
advice
of
my
medical
attendant
feray
i
went
back
to
among
the
mountains
and
spent
several
happy
months
with
and
evans
had
it
not
been
for
their
brotherly
and
sisterly
zeal
in
nursing
me
which
never
flagged
throughout
my
illness
future
travelers
might
have
been
able
to
point
to
a
little
on
the
and
have
given
a
chance
thought
to
an
adventurer
whom
the
fates
had
handled
roughly
but
there
was
more
in
this
than
i
could
see
my
destiny
was
then
slowly
shaping
throughout
the
rains
and
well
on
into
the
winter
i
stayed
with
and
evans
and
then
continued
my
walking
tour
as
is
hereafter
recorded
during
this
period
of
convalescence
i
studied
the
chinese
language
and
traveled
considerably
in
the
surrounding
country
is
a
city
of
many
scholars
and
it
was
not
at
all
difficult
for
me
to
find
a
satisfactory
teacher
he
was
an
old
man
with
a
straggly
beard
about
years
of
age
and
from
him
i
learned
much
about
life
in
general
in
addition
to
his
tutoring
in
chinese
i
had
the
advantage
also
of
close
contact
with
the
missionaries
with
whom
i
was
living
and
on
many
occasions
was
traveling
companion
of
samuel
pollard
one
of
the
finest
chinese
linguists
in
china
at
that
time
so
that
with
a
greatly
increased
knowledge
of
chinese
i
was
henceforth
able
to
hold
my
own
anywhere
during
this
period
too
many
days
were
profitably
passed
at
the
confucian
temple

it
is
equally
safe
to
say
that
whilst
all
is
open
and
may
be
seen
but
little
is
understood
in
the
far
eastern
and
european
press
so
much
is
heard
of
the
awakening
of
china
that
one
is
apt
really
to
believe
that
the
whole
empire
from
its
dan
to
beersheba
is
boiling
for
reform

it
may
be
that
the
husk
is
taken
from
the
kernel
the
husk

the
treaty
ports
and
some
of
the

the
kernel
is
that
vast
sleepy
interior
of

few
people
even
in
shanghai
know
what
it
means

that
to
the
european
pardon

ignorance
of
existing
conditions
so
much

focus
should
readily
be
granted

is
a
trip
likely
to
strike
optimism
in
the
breast
of
the
most
skeptical
foreigner
but
after
he
has
lived
for
a
couple
of
years
in
an
interior
city
as
i
have
done
with
its
antiquated
legislation
its
superstition
and
idolatry
its
infanticide
its
girl
suicides
its
public
corruption
and
moral
degradation
rubbing
shoulders
continually
at
close
quarters
with
the
inhabitants
and
himself
living
in
the
main
a
chinese
life
our
optimist
may
alter
his
opinions
and
stand
in
wonder
at
the
extraordinary
differences
in
the
most
ordinary
details
of
life
at
the
ports
on
the
china
coast
and
the
interior
and
of
the
gross
inconsistencies
in
the
chinese
mind
and
character
if
in
addition
he
has
stayed
a
few
days
away
from
a
city
in
which
the
foreigners
were
shut
up
inside
the
city
walls
because
the
roaring
mob
of
rebels
outside
were
asking
for
their
heads
and
he
has
had
to
abandon
part
of
his
overland
trip
because
of
the
fear
that
his
own
head
might
have
been
chopped
off
he
may
increase
his
wonder
to
doubt
the
aspect
here
in
politically
morally
socially
spiritually
is
that
of
another
kingdom
another
world
conditions
seem
for
the
most
part
the
same
yesterday
and
for
ever
and
in
his
new
environment
which
may
be
a
replica
of
twenty
centuries
ago
the
dream
he
dreamed
is
now
dispelled
china
he
says
is
awaking
she
barely
moves
she
is
still
under
the
torpor
of
the
ages
and
yet
again
in
the
capital
and
a
few
of
the
larger
cities
under
your
very
eyes
there
goes
on
a
reform
which
seems
to
be
the
most
sweeping
reform
asia
has
yet
known
such
are
the
inconsistencies
seemingly
unchangeable
irreconcilable
in
conception
or
in
fact
a
truthful
portrayal
of
them
tends
to
render
the
writer
a
most
inconsistent
being
in
the
eyes
of
his
reader
no
one
was
ever
sped
on
his
way
through
china
with
more
goodwill
than
was
the
writer
when
he
left
but
the
above
thoughts
were
then
in
his
mind

forming

a

of

with

pockmarked

that

little
place
with

little
street
lying
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
known
throughout

as
one
of
the
wildest
of

corners
nearly
ten
thousand
feet
high
a
terrific
climb
under
best
conditions
a
clear
and
stars
of
a
silvery
twinkle
looked
pityingly
upon
me
as
i
started
at
ignorant
of
the
dangerously
narrow
defile
leading
along
cliffs
high
up
from
the
yili
ho
in
the
dark
cautiously
i
groped
along
not
without
a
painful
emotion
of
impending
danger
as
i
watched
the
stellular
reflections
dancing
in
the
rushing
river
did
i
wander
on
in
the
wake
of
a
group
of
and
took
my
turn
in
being
assisted
over
the
broken
chasms
by
the
muleteers
two
fellows
got
down
below
and
practically
lifted
the
tiny
animals
over
the
passes
where
they
could
not
keep
their
footing
gradually
i
saw
the
nightlike
shadows
flee
away
and
with
the
dawn
came
signs
of
heavy
weather
snow
came
cold
and
sudden
as
we
slowly
and
toilsomely
ascended
the
velocity
of
the
wind
fiercely
increased
down
the
at
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
came
clouds
of
blinding
flinty
dust
making
the
blood
run
from
one
lips
and
cheeks
as
he
plodded
on
against
great
odds
with
the
biting
wind
howling
and
hissing
in
the
winding
ravines
and
hollows
headway
was
difficult
often
was
i
raised
from
my
feet
helplessly
i
clung
to
the
earth
for
safety
and
pulled
at
withered
grass
to
keep
my
footing
the
ponies
patient
little
brutes
with
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
strapped
to
their
backs
came
near
to
giving
up
the
ghost
being
swayed
hopelessly
to
and
fro
in
the
fury
for
hours
we
thus
toiled
up
pathways
seemingly
fitter
for
goats
than
men
where
leafless
trees
were
bending
destitute
of
life
and
helpless
towards
the
valley
as
the
keen
wind
went
sighing
moaning
wailing
through
their
bare
boughs
and
budless
twigs
such
a
gale
wilder
than
the
devil
passion
i
have
not
known
even
on
the
north
atlantic
in
february
at
times
during
the
day
progression
in
the
deepening
snow
seemed
quite
impossible
and
my
two
men
worn
and
weary
bearing
the
burden
of
an
excessively
fatiguing
day
threw
up
the
sponge
vowing
that
they
wished
they
had
not
taken
on
the
job
but
the
scenery
later
in
the
day
though
monotonously
so
was
grand
the
earth
was
literally
the
color
of
blood
the
crimson
paths
intertwining
the
darker
landscape
bore
to
one
imagination
a
vision
of
some
bloody
battle
veritable
rivers
of
human
blood
to
cheer
the
traveler
in
his
desolation
the
sun
struggled
vainly
to
pierce
with
its
genial
rays
through
the
heavy
angry
clouds
rolling
lazily
upwards
from
the
black
valleys
and
enveloping
the
earth
in
a
deep
infinity
of
severest
gloom
the
cold
was
damp
in
the
small
hollows
whereto
our
pathway
led
the
icy
dew
clung
to
one
hair
and
beard
from
little
brown
cottages
with
poor
thatched
roofs
letting
in
the
light
and
with
walls
and
woodwork
long
since
uniformly
rotten
men
and
women
emerged
rubbing
their
eyes
and
buttoning
up
their
garments
looking
wistfully
for
the
hidden
sun
at
feet
a
brute
of
a
fellow
was
administering
cruellest
chastisement
to
his
disobedient
who
took
her
scourging
in
good
part
i
passed
along
as
fast
as
i
could
to
the
ascent
over
which
a
road
led
in
and
around
the
mountain
with
alarming
steepness
a
road
which
at
home
would
never
be
negotiated
on
foot
or
on
horseback
but
which
here
forms
part
of
the
main
trade
route
from
the
extreme
summit
one
dropped
abruptly
into
a
protecting
gorge
where
falling
cascades
sparkling
like
crystal
showers
in
the
feeble
sunlight
occasionally
breaking
through
danced
playfully
over
the
slippery
rocks
a
stream
foamed
noisily
over
the
loose
stones
and
leapt
in
rushing
rapids
where
the
earth
had
given
way
there
was
no
grass
no

in
the
sudden
turnings
the
hurricane
roared
with
heavenly
anger
through
the
long
deep
chasms
over

fairly

laughed
hilariously
at
me
when
i
raved
at
some
carpenters
to
desist
their
clumsy
hammering
three
feet
above
my
head
hundreds
of
dogs
yelped
unceasingly
at
the
moon
and
with
the
usual
rows
of
the
men
in
mutual
invitation
to
come
and
wash
your
feet
or

fan
ching
fan
the
draughts
the
creaks
and
cracks
the
unintermitting
din
and
so
much
else
one
was
not
sorry
to
rise
again
with
the
lark
and
push
onwards
in
the
cold
down
below
this
horrid
town
there
is
a
plain
in
this
plain
there
is
a
hole
fifty
feet
deep
and
had
my
pony
which
i
was
leading
not
pulled
me
away
from
falling
thereinto
my
story
would
not
now
be
telling
to
kongshan
feet
past
feet
and
feet
one
hundred
li
away
was
a
journey
through
country
considerably
more
interesting
especially
towards
the
end
of
the
day
a
peculiar
combination
of
wooded
slope
and
rough
pathways
li
from
the
end
of
the
stage
overlooks
a
wide
expanse
of
barren
uninviting
moorland
deep
jagged
gullies
break
the
uneven
rolling
of
the
mountains
dark
weird
caverns
of
terrible
immensity
yawn
hungrily
from
the
surface
of
weariest
desolation
ever
widening
with
each
turn
mist
hid
the
ugliest
spots
high
up
among
the
peaks
whose
white
summits
peeping
sullenly
from
out
this
blue
sea
of
damp
haze
told
a
wondrous
story
of
winter
withering
all
life
to
death
a
spot
than
which
in
summer
few
places
on
earth
would
be
more
entrancing
but
these
mountains
are
breathing
out
a
solitude
which
is
eternal
man
here
has
never
been
far
away
beyond
lies
the
country
of
the
aborigines
but
even
the
lolo
wild
and
rugged
as
the
country
fearless
of
man
and
beast
have
never
dared
to
ascend
these
heights
they
are
mournful
cheerless
devoid
of
a
single
smile
from
the
common
mother
of
us
all
lacking
every
feature
by
which
the
earth
draws
man
into
a
spirit
of
unity
with
his
god
horrid
frowning
waste
and
aimless
discontinuity
of
land
harbinger
of
loneliness
and
of
evil
people
poor
struggling
beings
of
our
kind
here
seemed
mocked
of
destiny
and
a
hot
raging
of
misery
waged
within
them
for
all
that
the
heart
might
desire
and
wish
for
had
to
them
been
denied
if
indeed
the
earth
be
the
home
of
hope
and
man
greatest
possession
be
hope
then
would
it
seem
that
these
poor
creatures
were
entirely
cut
off
shut
out
from
life
wandering
wearisomely
through
the
world
in
one
long
battle
with
nature
whereby
to
gain
the
wherewithal
to
live
in
that
grim
desert
there
were
no
exceptions
it
was
the
common
lot
each
day
and
every
day
did
these
men
and
women
with
a
stolidity
of
destitution
and
temporal
and
spiritual
tribulation
gaze
upon
that
bare
unyielding
country
pregnant
only
with
aggravation
to
their
own
dire
wretchedness
in
such
spots
unhappily
in
not
few
does
the
mystery
of
life
grow
ever
more
mysterious
to
one
whom
distress
has
never
harassed
a
great
pity
seized
my
heart
but
these
poor
people
would
probably
have
laughed
had
they
known
my
thoughts
as
i
passed
they
came
uninterestedly
to
look
upon
me
they
watched
in
expressive
silence
they
were
silent
because
of
poverty
and
i
too
kept
a
seal
upon
my
lips
as
i
ate
the
good
things
here
provided
under
the
eyes
of
those
to
whom
hunger
had
given
none
but
a
jealous
outlook
pitiful
enough
were
it
thought
i
merely
to
watch
without
allowing
speech
to
escape
further
to
taunt
them
so
i
ate
and
they
looked
at
me
i
came
and
went
but
never
a
word
was
uttered
by
these
men
and
women
or
even
by
the
children
whose
most
painful
feeling
seemed
that
of
their
own
feebleness
they
were
indeed
feeble
units
standing
in
a
threatening
infinitude
of
life
and
their
thoughts
probably
dwelt
upon
my
luxury
and
wealth
as
mine
could
not
help
dwelling
upon
their
hungry
town
of
hungry
men
and
famished
children
words
can
not
paint
their
poverty
men
void
of
hope
of
life
of
purpose
of
idea
happy
for
them
that
they
had
known
no
other
we
ascended
over
a
road
of
unspeakable
torture
to
one
feet
gazing
down
far
away
into
a
seemingly
bottomless
abyss
we
could
faintly
hear
in
the
lulling
of
the
wind
the
rush
of
a
torrent
fed
by
a
hundred
mountain
streams
which
washed
our
path
and
in
horrible
disfigurement
tore
open
the
surface
of
the
the
long
day
was
drawing
wearily
to
a
close
as
the
sun
was
sinking
beyond
the
uneven
hills
over
which
i
was
to
climb
before
the
descent
to
the
town
begins
the
effect
of
the
green
and
gold
and
red
and
brown
produced
a
striking
picture
of
sweet
poetic
beauty
i
stood
in
contemplative
admiration
meditating
as
i
waited
for
my
coolies
who
sat
moodily
under
a
dilapidated
roadside
awning
nonchalantly
picking
out
mouldy
from
some
coarse
sweetmeat
sold
by
a
frowsy
female
then
upwards
we
toiled
in
the
dark
the
weird
groans
of
my
exhausted
men
and
the
falling
of
the
gravel
beneath
their
sandalled
feet
alone
breaking
the
hollow
gloom
uncanny
is
night
travel
in
china
who
knows
but
that
ghosts
those
denizens
of
the
hills
may
run
against
thee
and
bewitch
thee
murmured
one
man
to
the
others
they
stopped
and
i
stopped
with
them
and
in
the
darkness
pegging
on
alone
at
the
mercy
of
these
coolies
my
own
thoughts
were
not
unsynchronistic
at
last
with
no
slight
misgiving
we
came
down
into
the
city
smoke
dogs
barked
at
me
and
ran
away
like
the
curs
they
are
midway
down
the
stone
footway
my
yamen
runner
too
cautiously
crept
up
to
me
in
the
dark
muttering
something
and
i
floored
him
with
my
fist
afterwards
i
learnt
that
he
came
to
relieve
me
of
the
pony
i
was
leading
every
room
in
every
wretched
inn
was
occupied
opium
fumes
already
issued
from
the
doorways
and
it
was
now
pitch
dark
so
that
i
could
scarce
see
the
sallow
faces
of
the
hungry
uncouth
crowd
to
whom
with
no
little
irritation
i
tried
to
speak
as
i
peered
carefully
into
the
caravanserai
evident
it
certainly
was
that
the
duty
lying
nearest
to
me
at
that
particular
moment
to
myself
and
all
concerned
therein
was
to
accept
what
i
was
offered
and
not
wear
out
my
temper
in
grumbling
my
boy
lao
chang
an
the
brick
expressed
to
me
his
regrets
and
something
like
real
sympathy
shone
out
from
his
eyes
in
the
dimness
puh
teh
puh
teh
have
no
fear
have
no
fear
said
he
and
as
i
stood
the
while
piling
up
cruellest
torture
upon
my
uncourtly
host
he
made
off
to
prepare
a
downstair
room
to
lapse
into
modern
phraseology
first
through
an
outer
apartment
dark
as
darkest
night
on
past
the
caterwauling
cook
and
a
few
disreputable
culinary
asked
to
look
out
for
a
pony
which
i
could
not
see
but
which
i
was
told
might
kick
me
then
onward
to
my
boy
who
stood
on
a
stool
and
dropped
the
grease
of
a
huge
red
chinese
candle
among
his
plaited
hair
as
he
wobbled
it
above
his
head
to
light
the
way
he
gripped
me
tenderly
took
me
to
his
bosom
as
it
were
gave
me
one
push
and
i
was
there
he
tarried
not
what
right
had
he
to
listen
to
what
i
in
secret
would
say
of
the
horrid
keeper
and
his
twice
horrid
shakedown
inn
he
passed
out
swiftly
into
outer
darkness
uttering
a
groan
i
rudely
interpreted
as
that
or
nothing
that
or
nothing
it
a
room
that
is
in
so
far
as
four
sides
a
floor
and
a
ceiling
comprise
one
of
that
i
had
no
doubt
a
sort
of
uncomely
offshoot
from
the
main
inn
building
built
on
piles
in
the
earth
after
the
fashion
of
the
seashore
houses
of
the
malay
but
much
dirtier
and
incomparably
more
shaky
for
many
a
long
year
longer
than
mine
horrid
host
would
care
to
recollect
this
now
unoccupied
space
had
served
admirably
as
the
common
the
ruined
fireplace
was
still
there
later
it
had
been
the
stable
the
ruined
horse
trough
was
still
there
at
one
extreme
corner
only
could
i
stand
upright
long
sooty
cobwebs
graced
the
black
wood
beams
overhead
hanging
as
thick
as
icicles
in
a
mountain
valley
each
step
i
took
in
fear
and
trembling
the
slightest
move
threatened
to
collapse
the
whole
dilapidation
four
planks
four
inches
wide
at
the
widest
part
and
of
varying
lengths
and
thicknesses
placed
on
a
pile
of
loose
firewood
at
the
head
and
foot
comprised
the
bedstead
on
which
i
tremulously
sat
down
upon
this
improvised
apology
for
a
bed
under
my
mosquito
curtains
no
traveler
should
be
without
them
in
western
china
i
washed
my
blistered
feet
on
an
ancient
whilst
my
cook
saw
to
my
evening
meal
his
bringing
in
the
rice
tallied
with
my
laying
the
tablecloth
in
the
same
place
where
i
had
washed
my
feet
the
one
available
spot
as
i
ate
rats
came
brazenly
and
picked
up
the
grains
of
rice
i
dropped
in
my
inefficient
handling
of
chopsticks
and
in
scaring
off
these
hardened
hungry
vermin
i
accidentally
upset
tea
over
my
bed
whilst
at
the
same
moment
a
coolie
came
in
with
an
elephant
tread
with
the
result
that
my
european
lost
its
balance
from
the
top
of
a
tin
of
native
sugar
and
started
a
conflagration
threatening
to
make
short
work
of
me
and
my
belongings
not
to
mention
that
horrid
fellow
and
his
inn
during
the
night
the
moments
throbbed
away
as
i
lay
on
my
couch
moments
which
seemed
long
as
hours
and
no
gleaming
rift
broke
the
settled
and
deepening
blackness
of
my
hateful
environs
every
thing
and
every
place
was
full
of
the
wearisome
depressing
commonplace
of
interior
china
stenches
rose
up
on
the
damp
dank
air
and
throughout
the
night
through
the
opening
of
a
window
i
seemed
to
gaze
out
to
a
disconsolate
eternity
gaping
empty
unsightly
waking
from
my
dozing
at
the
hour
when
judgment
sits
upon
the
hearts
of
men
i
sat
in
ponderous
judgment
upon
all
to
whom
the
bungling
of
the
previous
day
was
due
there
were
the
rats
and
mice
and
cats
and
owls
and
creaks
and
cracks
no
quiet
about
the
place
from
night
to
morning
then
came
the
barking
of
dogs
the
noises
of
the
cocks
and
kine
of
horses
and
foals
of
pigs
and
geese
the
general
wail
of
the
zoological
kingdom
cows
bellowing
duck
diplomacy
and
much
else
so
that
it
were
not
surprising
to
learn
that
this
distinguished
traveler
in
these
contemptible
regions
was
sitting
on
a
bridge
looking
wearily
on
to
the
tower
on
the
summit
of
a
pretty
little
knoll
outside
kungshan
thinking
that
it
were
well
a
score
of
such
were
added
did
their
design
embrace
a
warning
to
evade
the
place
having
done
some
twenty
li
by
moonlight
i
managed
with
little
difficulty
to
reach
feet
by
this
road
which
is
not
the
main
road
to
the
capital
was
purposely
chosen
most
travelers
go
through
the
journey
is
comprised
of
pleasant
ascents
and
descents
over
the
latter
portion
of
the
great
plateau
and
a
very
appreciable
difference
in
the
temperature
was
here
noticed
while
the
people
at
the
of
the
province
from
which
i
had
come
were
shivering
in
their
rags
and
complaining
about
the
price
of
charcoal
the
population
here
basked
under
italian
skies
in
a
warm
sun
from
feet
the
country
was
beautifully
wooded
with
groves
of
firs
and
chestnuts
at
the
inn
to
which
i
was
led
the
phlegmatic
proprietor
after
wishing
me
peace
assumed
unostentatiously
the
becoming
attitude
of
a
customs
official
and
scrutinized
with
vigor
the
whole
of
my
gear
from
an
empty
calvert
tin
to
my
kodak
camera
showering
particularly
condescending
felicitations
upon
my
english
barnsby
saddle
and
thereto
attached
his
excitement
rose
at
once
he
called
loudly
for
his
confederates
a
band
of
inelegant
infidels
and
bidding
them
stand
one
by
one
at
given
distances
he
gaped
at
them
through
the
glasses
with
the
hilarity
of
a
schoolboy
and
the
stupidity
of
an
owl
he
jumped
he
shouted
he
waved
his
arms
about
me
and
handing
them
back
to
me
with
both
hands
shouted
deafeningly
in
my
ear
that
they
were
quite
beyond
his
ken
and
then
he
sucked
his
teeth
disgustingly
and
spat
at
my
feet
his
associates
were
speechless
asses
that
they
were
and
could
only
stare
in
horror
or
impudence
i
know
not
meantime
lao
chang
brought
tea
and
sallied
forth
immediately
to
fraternize
among
old
friends
as
i
drank
my
tea
after
having
invited
them
one
by
one
to
join
me
slowly
and
with
a
fitting
dignity
the
empty
stare
destitute
of
sense
or
sincerity
of
these
six
upstanding
chinese
gentry
sucking
at
as
long
as
their
own
overfed
bodies
forced
upon
me
a
sense
of
my
unfitness
for
the
unknown
conditions
of
the
life
of
the
place
a
sense
of
loneliness
and
social
unshelteredness
in
the
sterile
waste
of
their
fashionable
life
they
spoke
to
me
subsequently
and
i
bravely
threw
at
them
a
chinese
phrase
or
two
but
when
the
conversation
got
above
my
head
i
told
them
quietly
but
determinedly
that
i
could
not
understand
my
english
speech
seemed
vaguely
to
indicate
a
sudden
collapse
of
the
acquaintance
the
opening
of
a
gulf
between
us
destined
to
widen
to
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
swallowing
up
their
erstwhile
confidences
one
of
them
facetiously
remarked
that
the
gentleman
wished
to
eat
his
rice
and
as
they
cleared
out
falling
over
each
other
and
the
high
step
at
the
entrance
to
the
room
i
thought
that
no
matter
how
old
they
are
chinese
are
but
little
children
but
had
i
treated
them
as
little
children
i
should
have
found
that
they
were
old
men
there
was
in
me
withal
a
sense
of
better
rank
in
the
eyes
of
this
few
who
worshipped
in
heathen
china
the
satan
of
fashion
as
a
matter
of
fact
their
rank
had
emerged
from
such
long
centuries
ago
that
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
so
identified
with
them
that
they
were
hardly
capable
of
analysis
of
people
such
as
myself
as
i
looked
pityingly
upon
them
and
the
involved
simplicity
of
their
immutable
natures
i
realized
an
unconquerable
feeling
of
inborn
rank
and
natural
elevation
in
respect
to
nationality
this
is
however
against
my
personal
general
conception
of
eastern
peoples
but
i
must
admit
i
felt
it
this
afternoon
and
so
perhaps
it
is
with
the
majority
of
europeans
in
the
far
east
who
because
they
have
no
knowledge
of
the
language
or
a
familiarity
with
national
customs
and
ideas
remain
always
aliens
with
the
easterner
they
can
not
sympathize
with
him
in
his
joys
and
sorrows
his
likes
and
dislikes
his
prejudice
and
bias
or
understand
anything
of
his
point
of
view
this
is
one
of
the
hardest
lessons
for
the
european
traveler
in
china
who
has
little
of
the
language
because
we
do
not
understand
him
we
call
the
chinese
a
heathen
it
is
easier
now
to
the
chinese
his
country
is
the
best
in
the
world
his
province
better
than
any
other
of
the
eighteen
and
the
village
in
which
he
lives
the
most
enviable
spot
in
the
province
the
center
of
his
universe
speak
disparagingly
about
that
little
circle
critically
or
sympathetically
and
he
is
at
once
up
against
you
it
may
develop
narrowness
of
mind
and
smallness
of
soul
we
westerners
think
we
know
that
it
does
and
the
fact
that
he
allows
his
mental
horizon
to
be
bounded
by
such
narrow
confines
appears
to
us
to
render
him
anything
but
a
desirable
citizen
and
a
man
but
no
matter
the
chinese
on
the
other
hand
regards
as
barbarians
all
those
men
who
have
never
tasted
the
bliss
of
a
true
home
in
the
empire
which
is
celestial
part
of
this
feeling
is
patriotism
and
love
of
country
part
is
rank
conceit
but
englishmen
are
saying
that
england
is
the
most
christian
country
in
the
world
for
the
very
same
reason
rationally
speaking
john
is
the
old
brother
of
the
world
oldest
of
any
nation
by
very
many
centuries
in
common
with
all
other
travelers
and
those
who
have
lived
with
this
man
and
who
have
made
his
nature
a
serious
study
apart
from
racial
bias
i
am
perplexed
with
conundrums
which
can
not
be
solved
some
of
the
conundrums
are
perhaps
superficial
and
disappear
with
a
deeper
insight
into
his
life
others
are
wrought
into
his
being
yet
he
has
a
fixedness
of
character
reaching
in
some
directions
to
absolute
crystallization
he
possesses
the
virility
of
young
manhood
and
many
of
the
mutually
inconsistent
traits
of
late
manhood
and
early
youth
i
wonder
at
his
ignorance
of
merest
rudimentary
political
economy
but
why
this
man
explored
centuries
ago
the
cardinal
theories
of
some
of
our
western
classics
however
i
have
to
teach
him
the
form
of
the
earth
and
the
natural
causes
of
eclipses
he
is
frightened
by
ghosts
burns
mock
money
to
maintain
his
ancestors
in
the
future
state
worships
a
bit
of
rusty
old
iron
as
an
infallible
remedy
for
droughts
i
have
seen
him
shoot
at
clouds
from
the
city
walls
to
frighten
away
the
rain
and
i
despise
him
for
it
all
as
i
revise
this
copy
a
rumor
is
current
in
the
town
in
which
i
am
resting
to
the
effect
that
foreigners
are
buying
children
and
using
their
heads
to
oil
the
wheels
of
the
new
railway
and
i
despise
him
for
believing
it
the
chinese
will
not
fight
and
i
sneer
at
him
he
abhors
me
because
i
do
i
ridicule
his
manner
of
dress
he
thinks
mine
grossly
indecent
i
consider
his
flat
nose
and
the
plaited
hair
and
shaven
skull
as
heathenish
but
the
chinese
eating
away
with
his
to
me
ridiculous
chopsticks
looks
out
from
his
quick
eyes
and
considers
me
still
a
foreign
devil
although
he
is
too
cunning
to
tell
me
his
opinions
of
me
are
founded
upon
the
narrow
grounds
of
vanity
and
egotism
mine
although
i
do
not
admit
it
even
to
myself
from
something
very
much
akin
thereto
aa
i
have
been
looked
upon
in
outposts
of
the
chinese
empire
where
foreigners
are
still
unknown
as
an
example
of
those
human
monstrosities
which
come
from
the
west
a
creature
of
a
very
low
order
of
the
human
species
with
a
form
and
face
uncouth
with
language
a
hopeless
jargon
and
with
manners
unbearably
rude
and
obnoxious
not
that
personally
answer
accurately
to
this
description
reader
any
more
than
you
would
but
because
i
happen
to
be
among
a
people
who
as
far
back
as
chinese
opinion
of
foreigners
can
be
traced
have
considered
themselves
of
a
morality
and
intellectuality
superior
to
yours
and
mine
i
write
the
foregoing
because
it
sums
up
what
may
be
termed
the
current
ideas
regarding
europeans
ideas
the
reverse
of
complimentary
which
are
the
more
unfortunate
on
account
of
the
fact
that
they
are
held
by
the
vast
majority
of
a
people
forming
a
quarter
of
the
whole
human
race
this
is
true
despite
all
the
reform
these
ideas
may
be
and
i
trust
they
are
erroneous
but
i
know
that
i
must
keep
in
mind
the
extremely
important
desideratum
in
dealing
with
the
chinese
that
they
look
at
me
my
person
my
manners
my
customs
my
theories
my
things
through
chinese
eyes
and
although
mistaken
misled
reach
their
own
conclusions
from
their
own
point
of
view
this
is
what
they
have
been
doing
for
centuries
but
we
know
that
it
all
now
is
being
subjected
to
slow
change
the
original
stock
however
takes
on
no
change
whatever
and
several
generations
must
pass
before
this
transfer
of
mental
vision
can
be
effected
when
the
chinese
will
view
all
things
and
all
peoples
in
their
true
light
next
morning
my
three
men
were
heavy
the
lean
fellow
i
have
christened
him
shanks
a
long
shambling
human
bag
of
bones
moved
about
painfully
in
a
listless
sort
of
way
betokening
severe
rheumatics
his
joints
needed
oil
four
or
five
huge
basins
of
steaming
rice
and
the
customary
amount
of
reboiled
cabbage
however
bucked
him
up
a
bit
and
holding
up
a
crooked
bony
finger
he
indicated
intelligently
that
we
had
one
hundred
li
to
cover
whilst
engaged
in
conversation
thus
sounds
of
early
morning
revelry
reached
me
from
below
my
boy
his
accustomed
serenity
now
quite
disturbed
held
threateningly
above
the
head
of
the
yamen
runner
who
had
given
me
a
profound
kotow
the
evening
previous
prior
to
taking
on
his
duties
a
length
of
sugar
cane
he
evidently
meant
to
flatten
him
out
this
i
learned
was
because
this
shadower
of
the
august
presence
wished
to
take
about
li
away
instead
of
going
to
li
as
i
intended
i
got
him
in
looked
him
as
squarely
in
the
face
as
it
is
possible
when
a
chinese
wants
to
evade
your
scrutiny
told
him
i
wished
to
go
to
and
that
i
hoped
i
should
have
the
pleasure
of
his
company
thus
far
he
replied
with
a
grinning
smile
which
one
could
easily
have
taken
for
a
smiling
grin
oh
yes
foreign
mandarin
li
foreign
mandarin
foreign
mandarin
and
i
thought
the
incident
closed
such
is
the
appalling
gullibility
of
the
englishman
in
china
we
stopped
for
tea
at
a
small
hamlet
ten
li
out
the
place
was
deserted
save
for
a
small
starving
boy
whose
chief
attention
was
given
to
laborious
endeavors
to
make
his
clothing
meet
in
certain
necessary
areas
he
evidently
had
never
seen
a
foreigner
as
he
directed
his
optics
towards
me
he
winced
visibly
he
walked
round
me
several
times
fell
over
a
grimy
pail
of
stopped
gazed
in
enraptured
enchantment
with
parted
lips
and
outstretched
arms
as
if
he
had
begun
to
suspect
what
it
was
before
him
to
the
eye
of
the
beholder
however
he
gazed
as
yet
only
on
vacancy
but
just
as
i
was
about
to
attempt
he
was
gone
tearing
away
down
the
hill
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
the
ragged
remains
of
his
father
trousers
flapping
gently
in
the
breeze
as
i
rose
to
leave
crackers
frightened
my
pony
followed
in
a
few
moments
by
a
howling
hooting
unreasonable
rabble
from
a
temple
near
by
i
found
it
was
the
result
of
a
village
squabble
i
could
scarce
keep
the
order
of
my
march
as
i
left
the
so
roughly
was
i
handled
by
the
irritated
and
impatient
crowd
and
had
much
ado
to
refrain
from
responding
wrathfully
to
the
repeated
jeers
of
impudent
beggars
of
both
sexes
who
helped
to
swell
the
riotous
cortege
but
through
it
all
none
of
the
insults
were
meant
for
me
so
lao
chang
told
me
and
they
did
not
mean
to
treat
me
with
discourtesy
trees
hollowed
out
and
spanned
from
field
to
field
served
as
gutters
for
irrigation
shepherds
clad
in
white
felt
blankets
sat
huddled
upon
the
ground
behind
huge
boulders
oblivious
of
time
and
of
the
boisterous
wind
while
their
sheep
and
goats
grubbed
away
on
the
scanty
grass
the
moorland
provided
high
up
we
saw
forest
fires
making
the
earth
black
and
desolate
ruins
almost
everywhere
recalled
to
one
mind
the
image
of
a
past
prosperity
which
now
were
replaced
by
traces
of
misery
exterior
influences
which
seemed
to
breed
upon
the
traveler
a
deep
discouragement
i
came
across
some
women
for
the
dead
at
their
elbow
two
girls
were
washing
clothes
and
when
little
children
catching
sight
of
me
ran
to
their
mothers
the
women
stopped
their
had
a
good
stare
at
me
exchanged
a
few
words
of
mutual
inquiry
and
then
resumed
their
bellowing
soon
it
became
quite
warm
and
walking
was
pleasant
i
was
startled
by
the
ab
who
invited
me
to
go
to
a
neighboring
town
for
tea
my
men
were
far
behind
i
was
at
his
mercy
so
i
went
soon
i
found
myself
passing
through
the
city
gates
of
the
very
town
i
was
trying
to
keep
away
from
the
yamen
fellow
turned
back
at
me
and
chuckled
rudely
to
himself
i
insisted
that
i
did
not
wish
to
take
tea
he
insisted
that
i
should
i
must
he
led
me
to
an
inn
in
the
main
street
arrangements
were
made
to
house
me
old
men
and
young
lads
gathered
to
welcome
me
as
a
lost
brother
and
the
told
me
graciously
that
he
was
going
to
the
magistrate
in
cruel
english
with
many
wildly
threatening
gestures
did
i
protest
and
the
people
laughed
acquiescingly
puh

puh

you
gaping
idiots
i
repeated
and
it
caused
more
glee
swinging
myself
past
them
all
i
dragged
my
stubborn
pony
through
the
mob
to
the
gate
by
which
i
had
entered
my
men
were
not
to
be
found
i
did
not
know
the
road
nor
much
of
the

i
sat
down
on
a
granite
pillar
to
undergo
an
embarrassing
presently
my
men
hailed
me
and
approaching
swore
with
imposing
loftiness
at
the
discomfited
guide
my
coolie
dropped
his
loads
the
somehow
lost
his
footing
i
yelled

and
with
a
cheer
the

proceeded

at

and
since
then
have
made
frequent
visits
and
knowing
the
enormous
strides
being
made
towards
acquiring
occidental
methods
i
now
find
it
difficult
to
write
with
absolute
accuracy
upon
things
in
general
but
i
have
found
this
to
be
the
case
in
all
my
travels
what
is
or
seems
to
be
accurate
of
any
given
thing
in
a

is
wrong

seemingly
the

and
although

could
be

tempting
and
no

offer
wider
scope
for
ingenious
hypothesis

generalization
one
has
to
forego
much
temptation
to
color
if
he
would
be
accurate
of
anything
he
writes
of
the
chinese
eminent
sinologues
agree
as
to
the
impossibility
of
the
conception
of
the
chinese
mind
and
character
as
a
whole
so
glaring
are
the
inconsistencies
of
the
chinese
nature
and
as
one
sees
for
himself
in
this
great
city
particularly
in
official
life
the
businesslike
practicability
on
the
one
hand
and
the
utter
absurdity
of
administration
on
the
other
in
all
modes
and
methods
one
is
almost
inclined
to
drop
his
pen
in
disgust
at
being
unable
to
come
to
any
concrete
conclusions
of
no
province
in
china
more
than
of
is
this
true
reform
and
immovable
conservatism
go
hand
in
hand
men
of
the
most
dissimilar
ambitions
compose
the
and
are
willing
to
join
hands
to
propagate
their
main
beliefs
and
when
one
writes
of
progress
in
railways
in
the
army
in
gaols
in
schools
in
public
works
in
no
matter
what
one
is
ever
confronted
by
that
dogged
immutability
which
characterizes
the
older
school
so
that
in
writing
of
things
in
this
great
city
it
is
imperative
for
me
to
state
bare
facts
as
they
stand
now
and
make
little
comment
the
railway
the
railway
linking
the
interior
with
the
coast
is
one
of
the
world
most
interesting
engineering
romances
this
artery
of
steel
is
probably
the
most
expensive
railway
of
its
kind
from
the
constructional
standpoint
in
some
districts
seven
thousand
pounds
per
mile
was
the
cost
and
it
is
probable
that
six
thousand
pounds
sterling
per
mile
would
not
be
a
bad
estimate
of
the
total
amount
appropriated
for
the
construction
of
the
line
from
a
loan
of
francs
asked
for
in
by
the
colonial
council
in
connection
with
the
program
for
a
network
of
railways
in
and
about
french
to
there
are
no
less
than
one
hundred
and
bridges
the
completion
of
this
line
realizes
in
part
the
ambition
of
a
celebrated
frenchman
who
once
a
printer
is
said
in
paris
dropped
into
the
political
and
blossomed
forth
in
due
course
as
of
when
paul
doumer
for
it
was
he
went
east
in
he
felt
it
his
mission
to
put
france
politically
and
commercially
on
as
good
a
footing
as
any
of
her
rivals
notably
great
britain
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
see
that
the
best
missionaries
in
his
cause
would
be
the
railways
at
the
time
of
writing
june
i
can
not
but
think
that
profit
on
this
railway
will
be
a
long
time
coming
and
there
are
some
in
the
capital
who
doubt
whether
the
commercial
possibilities
of
justified
this
huge
expenditure
on
railway
construction
whilst
authorities
differ
i
personally
believe
that
the
ultimate
financial
success
of
the
venture
is
assured
there
are
markets
crying
out
to
be
quickly
fed
with
foreign
goods
and
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
french
will
be
the
suppliers
of
those
goods
british
enterprise
is
so
weak
that
we
can
not
capture
the
greater
portion
of
the
growing
foreign
trade
and
must
feel
thankful
if
we
can
but
retain
what
trade
we
have
and
supply
those
exports
with
which
the
french
have
no
possibility
of
competing
the
military
the
foreigner
in
can
never
rest
unless
he
is
used
to
the
sounds
of
the
bugle
and
the
hustling
spirit
of
the
men
of
war
in
standard
works
on
chinese
armaments
no
mention
is
ever
made
of
the
army
and
statistics
are
hard
to
get
but
it
is
evident
that
the
cult
of
the
military
stands
paramount
and
it
has
to
be
conceded
even
by
the
most
pessimistic
critics
of
this
backward
province
that
the
new
troops
are
sufficiently
numerous
and
sufficiently
to
crush
any
rebellion
this
must
be
counted
a
very
fair
result
since
it
has
been
attained
in
about
two
years
a
couple
of
years
ago
had
practically
no
army
none
more
than
the
military
ragtags
of
the
old
school
whose
chief
weapon
of
war
was
the
opium
pipe
but
now
there
are
ten
thousand
troops
not
units
on
paper
but
men
in
uniform
for
the
most
part
and
of
excellent
physique
who
could
take
the
field
at
once
the
question
of
the
army
is
one
of
international
interest
the
french
are
on
the
south
great
britain
on
the
west
on
june
i
rode
out
to
the
magnificent
training
ground
then
being
completed
and
on
that
date
wrote
the
following
in
my
diary
i
watched
for
an
hour
or
two
some
thousand
or
so
men
undergoing
their
daily
drill
typical
tin
soldiery
and
a
military
sham
only
with
the
merest
notion
of
matters
military
were
most
of
the
men
conversant
and
alike
in
ordinary
marching
when
it
was
most
difficult
for
them
even
to
maintain
regularity
of
step
or
in
more
complicated
drilling
there
was
a
lack
of
the
right
spirit
no
go
no
gusto
scores
and
scores
of
them
running
round
doing
something
going
through
a
routine
with
the
knowledge
that
when
it
was
finished
they
would
get
their
rice
and
be
happy
everyone
who
possesses
but
a
rudimentary
knowledge
of
the
chinese
knows
that
he
troubles
most
about
the
two
meals
every
day
should
bring
him
and
this
seems
to
be
the
pervading
line
of
thought
of
of
the
men
i
saw
on
the
padang
at
drill
officers
strutting
about
in
peacock
fashion
with
a
sword
dangling
at
their
side
showed
no
inclination
to
enforce
order
and
the
rank
and
file
knew
their
methods
so
that
the
disorder
and
haphazardness
of
the
whole
thing
was
absolutely
mutual
whilst
i
was
on
the
field
gazing
in
anything
but
admiration
on
the
scene
i
was
ordered
out
by
one
of
the
officers
in
a
most
unceremonious
manner
seeing
me
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
thick
voice
an
expression
meaning
out
commonly
used
to
drive
away
dogs
and
simultaneously
waved
his
sword
in
the
air
as
if
to
say
step
and
i
have
your
head
and
of
course
there
being
nothing
else
to
do
i
but
in
a
fashion
befitting
the
dignity
of
an
english
traveler
the
reorganization
of
the
army
with
the
acceleration
of
warlike
preparedness
has
the
advantage
that
it
appeals
to
the
embryonic
feeling
of
national
patriotism
and
affords
a
tangible
expression
of
the
desire
to
be
on
terms
of
equality
with
the
foreigner
that
officer
never
had
a
prouder
moment
in
his
life
than
when
he
ordered
a
distinguished
foreigner
from
the
drilling
ground
of
which
he
was
for
the
time
the
lordly
comptroller
and
it
may
be
added
that
the
foreigner
can
remember
no
occasion
when
he
felt
or
more
completely
shrivelled
whilst
it
is
safe
to
infer
that
the
motives
that
underlie
the
significant
access
of
activity
in
military
matters
in
differ
in
no
way
from
those
which
have
led
to
the
feverish
increase
in
armaments
in
other
parts
of
the
world
such
ideas
that
have
yet
been
formed
on
actual
preparations
for
possible
war
are
most
crude
on
paper
the
appointments
in
the
army
and
the
accuracy
of
the
figures
of
the
complement
of
rank
and
file
admit
of
no
question
but
the
practical
utility
of
their
labors
is
quite
another
matter
and
a
matter
which
does
not
appear
to
produce
among
the
army
officials
any
great
mental
disturbance
in
their
delusion
that
they
are
progressing
is
in
need
of
military
reform
reform
which
will
embrace
a
start
from
the
very
beginning
and
one
of
the
first
steps
that
should
be
taken
is
that
those
who
are
to
be
in
the
position
of
administering
training
should
find
out
something
about
western
military
affairs
and
so
be
in
a
position
of
knowing
what
they
are
doing
the
above
was
my
conscientious
opinion
in
the
middle
of
last
year
now
in
june
of
i
have
to
write
of
enormous
improvements
and
revolutions
in
the
drilling
in
the
armaments
in
the
equipment
in
the
general
organization
of
the
troops
and
the
conduct
of
them
is
still
peculiarly
in
her
transition
stage
which
while
it
has
many
elements
of
strength
and
many
menacing
possibilities
contains
more
or
less
many
of
the
old
weaknesses
all
matters
such
as
her
financial
question
her
tariff
question
her
railway
question
her
mining
question
are
still
in
the
air
the
unknown
in
the
equation
as
it
were
but
her
army
question
is
settled
there
is
a
definite
line
to
be
followed
here
and
it
is
being
followed
most
rigidly
come
what
will
her
army
must
be
safe
and
sound
china
is
determined
to
work
out
the
destiny
of
herself
and
she
is
working
hard
the
west
has
no
conception
how
hard
so
as
to
be
able
to
be
in
a
position
of
safeguarding
vigorously
if
necessary
her
own
borders
one
question
arises
in
my
mind
however
should
there
be
a
rebellion
would
the
soldiers
remain
true
this
is
vital
to
skirmishings
on
the
french
border
more
or
less
recently
have
shown
us
that
soldiers
are
wobblers
in
that
area
the
rank
and
file
are
chosen
from
the
common
people
and
one
would
not
be
surprised
to
find
should
trouble
take
place
fairly
soon
while
they
are
still
raw
to
their
business
the
soldiers
turn
to
those
who
could
give
them
most
it
has
been
humorously
remarked
that
in
case
of
disturbances
the
first
thing
the
chinese
tommy
would
do
would
be
to
shoot
the
officers
for
treating
him
so
badly
and
for
drilling
him
so
hard
and
long
what
is
true
of
the
capital
in
respect
to
military
progress
i
found
to
be
true
also
of
a
couple
of
years
ago
a
company
of
drilled
soldiers
arrived
there
as
a
nucleus
for
recruiting
units
for
the
new
army
soon
men
were
enlisted
they
were
to
serve
a
three
years
term
were
to
receive
four
dollars
per
month
and
were
promised
good
treatment
the
officers
drilled
them
from
dawn
to
dusk
deserters
were
therefore
many
necessitating
the
detail
of
a
few
heads
coming
off
to
avert
the
trouble
of
losing
all
the
men
it
cost
the
men
about
a
dollar
or
so
for
their
rice
so
that
it
will
be
readily
seen
that
with
a
clear
profit
of
three
dollars
as
a
monthly
allowance
they
were
better
off
than
they
would
have
been
working
on
their
land
officers
received
from
forty
to
sixty
taels
a
month
temples
here
were
converted
into
barracks
a
sign
in
itself
of
the
altered
conditions
of
the
times
and
i
visited
some
extensive
buildings
which
were
being
erected
at
a
cost
of
eighty
thousand
gold
dollars
military
progress
in
this
backward
province
is
as
great
as
it
has
been
anywhere
at
any
time
in
any
part
of
the
chinese
empire
the
police
until
a
few
years
ago
as
china
was
kept
in
law
and
order
without
the
necessary
evil
of
a
standing
army
so
did
slumber
on
in
the
chinese
equivalent
for
peace
and
plenty
as
they
now
are
and
taking
into
consideration
that
they
were
all
picked
from
the
rawest
material
the
police
force
of
this
capital
is
as
able
a
body
of
men
as
are
to
be
found
in
all
western
china
probably
the
metropolitan
police
of
dear
old
london
could
not
be
from
their
ranks
but
disciplined
and
they
certainly
are
withal
swords
seem
to
take
the
place
of
the
english
bludgeon
and
a
peaked
cap
beribboned
with
gold
is
substituted
for
the
helmet
of
blue
and
if
the
time
should
ever
come
with
international
rights
when
englishmen
will
be
run
in
in
the
empire
the
sallow
physiognomy
and
the
dangling
pigtail
alone
will
be
unmistakable
proofs
to
the
victim
even
in
heaviest
intoxication
that
he
is
not
being
handled
by
policemen
of
his
awn
kind
that
is
if
the
police
shall
ever
have
made
strides
towards
the
attainment
of
home
police
principles
however
in
their
place
these
men
have
done
good
work
thieving
in
the
city
is
now
much
less
common
and
gambling
although
still
rife
under
cover
when
will
the
chinese
eradicate
that
inherent
spirit
is
certainly
being
put
down
one
of
the
features
of
their
work
also
has
been
the
improvement
they
have
effected
in
the
appearance
of
the
streets
old
customs
are
dying
and
at
the
present
time
if
a
man
in
his
untutored
little
ways
throws
his
domestic
refuse
into
the
place
where
the
gutter
should
have
been
as
in
olden
days
he
is
immediately
pounced
upon
reprimanded
by
the
policeman
on
duty
and
fined
somewhat
stiffly
the
gaol
a
great
fuss
was
made
about
me
when
i
went
to
visit
the
governor
of
the
prison
one
wet
morning
he
met
me
with
great
ostentation
at
the
entrance
escorting
me
through
a
clean
courtyard
on
either
side
of
which
were
pretty
and
plots
of
green
turf
to
a
there
was
nothing
quadlike
about
the
place
this
furnished
on
a
plan
overlooked
the
main
prison
buildings
contained
foreign
glass
windows
draped
with
white
curtains
was
scrupulously
clean
for
china
and
had
magnificent
hanging
scrolls
on
the
whitewashed
walls
tea
was
soon
brewed
and
the
governor
wishing
to
be
polite
and
sociable
told
me
that
he
had
been
in
for
a
few
months
only
and
that
he
considered
himself
an
extremely
fortunate
fellow
to
be
in
charge
of
such
an
excellent
prison
one
of
the
finest
in
the
kingdom
he
assured
me
after
we
had
drunk
each
other
health
i
sincerely
trust
that
the
cute
courteous
old
chap
will
live
a
long
and
happy
life
although
to
my
way
of
thinking
the
knowledge
of
the
evil
deeds
of
all
the
criminals
around
me
would
considerably
minimize
the
measure
of
bliss
among
such
intensely
mundane
things
i
was
led
away
to
the
prison
proper
this
gaol
which
had
been
opened
only
a
few
months
is
a
remarkably
fine
building
and
with
the
various
workshops
and
outhouses
and
offices
covers
from
seven
to
eight
acres
of
ground
inside
the
city
the
outside
and
indeed
the
whole
place
bears
every
mark
of
western
architecture
with
a
trace
here
and
there
of
the
chinese
artistry
and
for
carved
stone
and
brick
might
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
foreign
building
it
cost
some
ninety
thousand
taels
to
build
and
has
accommodation
for
more
than
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
prisoners
at
present
confined
within
its
walls
after
an
hour
inspection
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
lot
of
the
prisoners
was
cast
in
pleasant
places
the
food
was
being
prepared
at
the
time
three
kinds
of
vegetables
with
a
liberal
quantity
of
rice
much
better
than
of
the
poor
brutes
lived
on
before
they
came
to
gaol
besworded
warders
guarded
the
entrances
to
the
various
outbuildings
from
twenty
to
thirty
poor
human
beings
were
manacled
in
their
cells
condemned
to
die
knowing
not
how
soon
the
pleasure
of
the
emperor
may
permit
of
them
shuffling
off
this
mortal
coil
one
old
man
was
among
the
number
and
to
see
him
stolidly
waiting
for
his
doom
brought
sad
thoughts
the
prisoners
work
of
course
as
they
do
in
all
prisons
weaving
cloth
mostly
for
the
use
of
the
military
seemed
to
be
the
most
important
industry
there
being
over
a
score
of
weaving
machines
busily
at
work
the
task
set
each
man
is
twelve
english
yards
per
day
if
he
does
not
complete
this
quantity
he
is
thrashed
if
he
does
more
he
is
remunerated
in
money
one
was
amused
to
see
the
machine
lying
covered
with
dust
in
a
corner
now
discarded
but
from
its
pattern
all
the
others
had
been
made
in
the
prison
tailors
rose
as
one
man
when
we
entered
their
shop
where
singer
machines
were
rattling
away
in
the
hands
of
competent
men
and
opposite
were
a
body
of
pewter
workers
some
of
their
products
turned
out
with
most
primitive
tools
being
extremely
clever
the
authorities
had
bought
a
foreign
chair
made
of
iron
a
sort
of
miniature
garden
seat
and
from
this
pattern
a
squad
of
blacksmiths
were
turning
out
facsimiles
which
were
selling
at
two
dollars
apiece
they
were
well
made
but
a
skilled
mechanic
not
himself
a
prisoner
was
teaching
the
men
bamboo
blinds
were
being
made
in
the
same
room
whilst
at
the
extreme
end
of
another
shed
were
paper
dyers
and
finishers
carrying
on
a
primitive
work
in
the
same
primitive
way
that
the
chinese
did
thousands
of
years
ago
it
was
however
exceedingly
interesting
to
watch
as
we
passed
along
i
smelt
a
strong
smell
of
opium
yes
it
was
opium
i
sniffed
significantly
and
looked
suspiciously
around
the
governor
saw
and
heard
and
smelt
but
he
said
nothing
opium
then
is
not
as
is
claimed
abolished
in
worse
than
this
whilst
i
was
the
other
day
calling
upon
the
french
doctor
at
the
hospital
the
vilest
fumes
exuded
from
the
room
of
one
of
the
dressers
it
appeared
that
the
doctor
could
not
break
his
men
of
the
habit
but
we
remember
that
the
physician
of
older
days
was
exhorted
to
heal
himself
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
think
i
had
seen
all
there
was
to
be
seen
i
heard
a
scuffle
and
saw
a
of
men
surrounding
a
poor
frightened
little
fellow
to
whom
i
was
introduced
he
was
the
little
bogus
emperor
of
china
the
young
pretender
to
whom
thousands
of
people
at
the
time
of
the
dual
decease
in
recent
chinese
history
did
homage
and
kotowed
recognizing
him
as
the
new
emperor
the
story
not
generally
known
outside
the
province
makes
good
reading
at
the
time
of
the
death
of
the
emperor
and
an
aboriginal
family
at
the
village
of
in
the
southeast
of
province
knowing
that
a
successor
to
the
throne
must
be
found
and
having
a
son
of
about
eight
years
of
age
put
this
boy
up
as
a
pretender
to
the
chinese
throne
and
not
without
considerable
success
the
news
spread
that
the
new
emperor
was
at
the
village
and
the
people
for
miles
around
flocked
in
great
numbers
to
do
him
homage
congratulating
themselves
that
the
emperor
should
have
risen
from
the
immediate
neighborhood
in
which
they
themselves
had
passed
a
monotonous
existence
for
weeks
this
pretense
to
the
throne
was
maintained
until
a
miniature
rebellion
broke
out
to
quell
which
the
viceroy
of
dispatched
with
all
speed
a
strong
body
of
soldiers
everybody
thought
that
the
loss
of
a
few
heads
and
other
chinese
trivialities
was
to
end
this
little
flutter
of
the
people
but
not
so
the
whole
of
the
family
who
had
promoted
this
fictitious
claim
to
the
throne
father
mother
brothers
sisters
were
all
put
to
death
most
of
them
in
front
of
the
eyes
of
the
poor
little
fellow
who
was
the
victim
of
their
idle
pretext
the
military
returned
reporting
that
everything
was
now
quiet
and
a
few
days
later
guarded
by
twenty
soldiers
came
this
young
pretender
encaged
in
one
of
the
prison
boxes
breaking
his
heart
with
grief
and
it
was
he
who
was
now
conducted
to
meet
the
foreigner
he
has
been
confined
within
the
prison
since
he
arrived
at
the
capital
and
the
object
seems
to
be
to
keep
him
there
training
and
teaching
him
until
he
shall
have
arrived
at
an
age
when
he
can
be
taught
a
trade
the
tiny
fellow
is
small
for
his
eight
years
and
his
little
wizened
face
sallow
and
delicate
has
a
plausible
tale
to
tell
he
is
always
fretting
and
grieving
for
those
whose
heads
were
shown
to
him
after
decapitation
however
he
is
being
cared
for
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
authorities
or
even
the
emperor
himself
will
mete
out
punishment
to
him
when
he
grows
older
he
did
nothing
he
knew
nothing
at
the
present
time
he
is
going
through
a
which
teaches
him
the
language
to
be
used
in
audience
with
the
son
of
heaven
he
will
probably
be
taken
before
the
emperor
when
he
is
old
enough
but
now
he
is
not
living
the
life
of
a
boy
no
playmates
no
toys
no
romps
and
frolics
he
like
topsy
merely
grows
in
surroundings
which
only
a
dark
prison
life
can
give
him
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
even
been
in
prison
in
china
this
remark
rather
tickled
the
governor
and
on
taking
my
departure
he
assured
me
that
it
was
an
honor
to
him
which
the
chinese
language
was
too
poor
to
express
that
i
should
have
allowed
my
honorable
and
dignified
person
to
visit
his
mean
and
contemptible
abode
he
commenced
this
compliment
to
me
as
he
was
showing
me
the
hospital
in
connection
with
the
prison
containing
eight
separate
wards
in
charge
of
a
chinese
doctor
i
smiled
in
return
a
smile
of
deepest
gratitude
and
waving
a
fond
farewell
left
him
in
a
happy
mood
the
schools
one
would
scarce
dream
of
a
university
for
the
province
of
yet
such
is
the
case
in
former
days
and
it
is
true
too
to
a
great
extent
the
prominent
place
given
to
education
in
china
rendered
the
village
schools
an
object
of
more
than
common
interest
where
the
educated
men
of
the
empire
received
their
first
intellectual
training
probably
in
no
other
country
was
there
such
uniformity
in
the
standards
of
instruction
every
educated
man
was
then
a
potential
school
master
this
was
certainly
true
of
but
all
is
now
changing
as
the
infusion
of
the
spirit
of
the
phrase
china
for
the
chinese
gains
forceful
meaning
among
the
people
the
highest
hill
within
the
city
precincts
has
been
chosen
as
the
site
for
a
university
which
is
truly
a
remarkable
building
for
western
china
one
of
the
students
of
the
late
mateer
shantung
was
the
architect
a
man
who
came
originally
to
the
school
as
a
teacher
of
mathematics
and
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
huge
oblong
building
with
a
long
narrow
wing
on
either
side
of
a
central
dome
is
the
acme
of
beauty
from
a
purely
architectural
standpoint
of
brick
this
university
which
cost
over
two
hundred
thousand
taels
to
build
is
most
imposing
and
possesses
conveniences
and
improvements
quite
comparable
to
the
ordinary
college
of
the
west
for
instance
as
i
passed
through
the
many
schoolrooms
well
ventilated
and
airy
i
saw
an
italian
who
was
laying
in
the
electric
light
ac
the
power
for
which
was
generated
by
an
immense
dynamo
at
the
basement
upon
which
alone
twenty
thousand
taels
were
spent
thirty
professors
have
the
control
of
classrooms
teaching
among
other
subjects
mathematics
music
languages
chiefly
english
and
japanese
geography
chemistry
astronomy
geology
botany
and
so
on
the
museum
situated
in
the
center
of
the
building
does
not
contain
as
many
specimens
as
one
would
imagine
quite
easily
obtainable
but
there
are
certainly
some
capital
selections
of
things
natural
to
this
part
of
the
empire
the
authorities
probably
thought
i
was
rather
a
queer
foreigner
wanting
to
see
everything
there
was
to
see
inside
the
official
barriers
in
the
city
day
after
day
i
was
making
visits
to
places
where
foreigners
seldom
have
entered
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
officials
whilst
treating
me
with
the
utmost
deference
and
extreme
punctiliousness
thought
i
was
a
sort
of
british
spy
when
i
went
to
the
agricultural
school
probably
the
most
interesting
visit
i
made
i
was
met
by
the
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
a
keen
fellow
who
spoke
english
well
and
who
having
been
trained
at
shanghai
and
therefore
understanding
the
idiosyncrasies
of
the
foreigner
character
was
invited
to
entertain
and
this
he
did
but
he
was
careful
that
he
did
not
give
away
much
information
regarding
the
progress
that
the
essentially
sons
of
the
soil
are
making
in
agriculture
for
this
school
of
agriculture
is
an
important
adjunct
scholars
are
taken
on
an
agreement
for
three
years
during
which
time
they
are
fed
and
housed
at
the
expense
of
the
school
if
they
leave
during
the
specified
period
they
are
fined
heavily
no
less
than
boys
ranging
from
sixteen
to
are
being
trained
here
with
about
paid
apprentices
three
japanese
professors
are
employed
one
at
a
salary
of
two
hundred
dollars
a
month
and
two
others
at
three
hundred
the
latter
having
charge
of
the
fruit
and
forest
trees
and
the
former
of
vegetables
in
years
to
come
the
silk
industry
of
will
rank
among
the
chief
and
the
productions
will
rank
among
the
best
of
all
the
eighteen
provinces
there
are
no
less
than
ten
thousand
mulberry
trees
in
the
school
grounds
for
feeding
the
worms
four
thousand
catties
of
leaves
are
used
every
day
for
their
food
five
hundred
immense
trays
of
silkworms
are
constantly
at
work
here
the
worms
are
in
the
charge
of
scholars
whose
names
appear
on
the
various
racks
under
their
charge
and
the
fact
that
feeding
takes
place
every
two
hours
day
and
night
is
sufficient
testimony
that
the
boys
go
into
their
work
with
commendable
energy
as
i
was
being
escorted
around
the
building
through
shed
after
shed
filled
with
these
trays
of
silkworms
several
of
the
scholars
made
up
a
sort
of
procession
and
waited
for
the
eulogy
that
i
freely
bestowed
in
another
building
small
boys
were
spinning
the
silk
and
farther
down
the
weavers
were
busy
with
their
primitive
machinery
with
which
however
they
were
turning
out
silk
that
could
be
sold
in
london
at
a
very
big
price
the
colorings
were
specially
beautiful
and
the
figuring
quite
good
although
the
of
the
school
told
me
that
he
hoped
for
improvements
in
that
direction
and
i
looking
wise
although
knowing
little
about
silk
and
its
manufacture
heartily
agreed
with
the
little
fat
man
there
is
a
department
for
women
also
and
contrary
to
custom
i
had
a
look
around
here
too
the
girls
were
particularly
smart
at
spinning
footnotes
footnote
ac
soon
afterwards
a
disturbance
occurred
among
the
students
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
promptitude
of
the
inspector
some
of
them
might
have
lost
their
heads
the
electric
light
had
just
been
laid
in
and
was
working
so
well
that
the
authorities
found
it
imperative
to
charge
each
of
the
resident
students
one
dollar
per
month
for
the
upkeep
this
simple
edict
was
the
cause
of
the
riot
in
a
body
the
boys
rolled
up
their
pukais
and
marched
down
to
the
main
entrance
declaring
that
they
were
determined
to
resign
if
the
order
was
not
rescinded
the
inspector
however
had
had
all
the
doors
locked
the
frenzied
students
broke
these
open
and
incidentally
thrashed
some
of
the
caretakers
for
interfering
in
matters
which
were
not
considered
to
be
strictly
their
business
subsequently
the
chancellor
of
education
visited
the
college
in
person
but
no
heed
was
paid
to
his
exhortations
and
it
was
only
when
the
dollar
charge
for
lighting
was
reduced
that
peace
was
restored
the
chancellor
as
a
last
word
told
them
that
if
they
vacated
their
schoolrooms
a
fine
of
about
a
hundred
taels
would
be
imposed
upon
each
man
the
occasion
was
marked
by
all
the
foolish
ardor
one
finds
among
college
boys
at
home
and
it
seems
that
despite
the
enormous
amount
of
money
the
college
is
costing
to
run
the
students
are
somewhat

from

continued
over
barren

bereft
of

and
void
of

and

a
rough
climb
of
an
hour

took

to
the

roads

followed
a

for

lying
at
the
foot
of
the
most
magnificent
mountain
range
in
and
by
the
side
of
the
most
famous
lake
a
paved
road
takes
one
in
to
his
destination
at
where
i
was
welcomed
by
and
clark
of
the
china
inland
mission
and
hospitably
entertained
for
a
couple
of
days
the
roads
in
general
from
to
were
worse
than
any
i
have
met
from
onwards
partly
owing
to
the
mountainous
condition
of
the
country
and
partly
to
neglect
of
maintenance
where
the
road
is
paved
it
is
in
most
places
worse
than
if
it
had
not
been
paved
at
all
as
neither
skill
nor
common
sense
seems
to
have
been
exercised
in
the
work
it
is
probably
safe
to
say
that
there
are
no
ancient
roads
in
in
the
sense
of
the
constructed
highways
which
have
lasted
through
the
centuries
for
the
civilization
of
the
early
was
not
equal
to
such
works
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
condition
of
the
roads
is
all
but
intolerable
many
were
never
made
and
are
seldom
mended
one
may
say
that
with
very
few
exceptions
they
are
never
repaired
except
when
utterly
impassable
and
then
in
the
most
manner
my
rusty
received
a
shock
to
his
nervous
system
as
i
led
him
leisurely
from
the
incline
leading
into
feet
through
the
arched
gateway
in
a
entrance
which
when
new
would
have
been
a
credit
to
any
city
the
stones
of
the
main
street
were
so
slippery
that
i
could
hardly
keep
on
my
legs
frightened
by
one
of
their
number
dragging
its
empty
wooden
carrying
frame
along
the
ground
behind
it
a
drove
of
lashed
and
bucked
and
tossed
themselves
out
of
order
and
an
instant
afterwards
came
towards
my
pathway
by
the
side
of
the
road
all
of
my
men
caught
the
panic
and
in
their
mad
rush
several
were
knocked
down
and
trampled
upon
by
the
torrent
of
frightened
creatures
i
thought
i
was
being
charged
by
cavalry
but
beyond
a
good
deal
of
bruising
i
escaped
unhurt
closer
and
closer
came
the
hubbub
and
the
din
of
the
town
the
market
was
not
yet
over
as
i
approached
the
big
street
throngs
of
yokels
quite
out
of
hand
created
a
uproar
as
they
thriftily
drove
their
bargains
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
the
motley
mob
and
putting
on
a
bold
front
pushed
through
in
a
careless
manner
ponies
with
salt
came
in
from
the
other
end
of
the
town
and
in
their
waddling
the
little
brutes
gave
me
more
knocks
it
was
an
awful
crowd
chinese
minchia
lolo
and
other
specimens
of
hybridism
unknown
to
me
yet
i
suppose
the
majority
of
them
may
be
called
happy
certainly
the
simplicity
of
the
life
of
the
common
people
their
freedom
from
fastidious
tastes
which
are
only
a
fetter
in
our
own
western
social
life
their
absolute
independence
of
furniture
in
their
homes
their
few
wants
and
perhaps
fewer
necessities
when
contrasted
with
the
demands
of
the
englishman
is
to
them
a
state
of
high
civilization
here
were
farmers
mechanics
shopkeepers
and
retired
people
living
a
simple
unsophisticated
life
all
the
strength
of
the
world
and
all
its
beauties
all
true
joy
everything
that
consoles
that
feeds
hope
or
throws
a
ray
of
light
along
our
dark
paths
everything
that
enables
us
to
discern
across
our
poor
lives
a
splendid
goal
and
a
boundless
future
comes
to
us
from
true
simplicity
i
do
not
say
that
we
get
all
this
from
the
chinese
but
in
many
ways
they
can
teach
us
how
to
live
in
the
of
they
were
living
from
hand
to
mouth
with
seemingly
no
anxieties
at
all
and
yet
too
they
were
living
without
god
and
with
very
little
hope
and
here
the
foreigner
to
disturb
them
even
in
only
a
day
from
the
capital
i
was
regarded
as
a
being
of
another
species
and
was
treated
with
little
respect
i
was
not
wanted
no
international
question
has
become
more
hackneyed
than
does
china
want
the
foreigner
columns
of
utter
nonsense
have
from
time
to
time
been
printed
in
the
english
press
purporting
to
have
come
from
men
supposed
to
know
to
the
effect
that
this
empire
is
crying
out
waiting
with
open
arms
to
welcome
the
european
and
the
american
with
all
his
advanced
methods
of
christendom
and
civilization
it
has
by
general
assent
come
to
be
understood
that
china
want
the
foreigner
but
those
who
know
the
chinese
and
who
have
lived
with
them
and
know
their
inherent
insincerity
in
all
that
they
do
still
wonder
on
and
still
ask
does
she
to
the
european
in
or
any
of
the
china
ports
having
trustworthy
chinese
on
his
commercial
staff
without
whom
few
businesses
in
the
far
east
can
make
progress
my
argument
may
seem
to
have
no
he
will
be
inclined
to
blurt
out
vehemently
the
absurdity
of
the
idea
that
the
chinese
do
not
want
the
foreigner
first
they
can
not
do
without
him
if
china
is
to
come
into
line
as
a
great
nation
among
eastern
and
western
powers
and
then
again
could
anyone
doubt
the
sincerity
of
the
desire
on
the
part
of
the
celestial
for
closer
and
downright
friendly
intercourse
if
he
has
had
nothing
more
than
mere
superficial
dealings
with
them
thus
thought
the
writer
at
one
time
in
his
life
he
has
had
in
a
large
commercial
firm
some
of
the
best
chinese
assistants
living
in
china
or
out
of
it
and
has
nothing
but
praise
for
their
assiduous
perseverance
and
remarkable
business
acumen
and
integrity
as
a
business
man
i
admire
them
far
and
away
above
any
other
race
of
people
in
the
east
and
far
east
is
there
any
business
man
in
the
straits
settlements
who
has
not
the
same
opinion
of
the
chinese
but
as
one
who
has
traveled
in
china
living
among
the
chinese
and
with
them
seeing
them
under
all
natural
conditions
at
home
in
their
own
country
i
say
unhesitatingly
that
at
the
present
time
only
an
infinitesimal
percentage
of
the
population
of
the
vast
interior
entertain
genuine
respect
for
the
white
man
and
in
centers
where
western
influence
has
done
so
much
to
break
down
the
hatred
towards
us
the
real
unveneered
attitude
of
the
ordinary
chinese
is
one
not
calculated
to
foster
between
the
occident
and
the
orient
the
brotherhood
of
man
difficult
is
it
for
the
foreigner
in
civilized
parts
of
china
and
impossible
for
the
great
preponderance
of
the
european
peoples
at
home
to
grasp
the
fact
that
in
huge
tracts
of
interior
china
the
populace
have
never
seen
a
foreigner
save
for
the
ubiquitous
missionary
who
takes
on
more
often
than
not
the
dress
of
the
native
although
the
chinese
government
recognizes
the
dangerous
situation
of
the
nation
with
nations
of
europe
and
has
ratified
one
treaty
after
another
with
us
the
nation
itself
does
not
so
far
as
the
traveler
can
see
appreciate
the
fact
that
she
can
not
possibly
resist
the
white
man
and
hold
herself
in
seclusion
as
formerly
from
the
western
world
china
is
discovering
has
discovered
officially
although
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
nationally
as
japan
did
so
admirably
when
her
progress
was
most
marked
that
steam
and
machinery
have
made
the
world
too
small
for
any
part
thereof
to
separate
itself
entirely
from
the
broadening
current
of
the
world
life
whilst
not
for
a
moment
failing
to
admire
the
aggressive
character
of
occidentals
and
the
resultant
necessity
of
thwarting
them
we
see
this
especially
in
official
circles
in
chinese
leaders
of
thought
and
activity
are
recognizing
that
in
international
relations
the
final
appeal
can
be
only
to
a
superior
power
and
that
power
to
be
superior
must
be
thorough
and
thorough
throughout
so
different
to
what
has
held
good
in
china
for
countless
ages
that
is
why
china
is
making
sure
of
her
army
and
why
she
will
have
ready
in
ten
years
before
the
period
originally
intended
no
less
than
divisions
each
division
formed
of
ten
thousand
units
a
china
is
now
endeavoring
to
walk
the
ground
which
led
japan
to
greatness
among
the
nations
she
takes
japan
as
her
pattern
and
thinks
that
what
japan
has
done
she
can
do
and
officially
abandoning
her
long
course
of
isolation
is
plunging
into
the
flood
of
international
progress
determined
to
acquire
all
the
knowledge
she
can
and
thus
win
for
herself
a
place
among
the
powers
but
i
am
in
and
things
move
slowly
here
all
this
does
not
mean
that
my
presence
is
desired
or
that
fear
of
me
the
foreigner
has
ceased
on
the
contrary
it
signifies
that
i
am
more
greatly
to
be
feared
the
european
is
wanted
in
china
no
matter
how
absurd
it
may
seem
to
the
student
of
international
politics
who
sits
and
devours
all
the
newspaper
copy
good
bad
and
indifferent
which
filters
through
regarding
china
becoming
the
el
dorado
of
the
westerner
he
is
wanted
for
no
other
reason
than
that
of
teaching
the
chinese
to
foreignize
as
much
as
he
can
teaching
the
leaders
of
the
people
to
strive
to
modify
national
life
and
to
raise
public
conduct
and
administration
to
the
best
standards
of
the
west
when
china
is
capable
of
looking
after
herself
and
able
to
maintain
the
position
she
is
securing
by
the
aid
of
the
foreigner
in
her
provinces
following
her
present
mode
of
thought
and
action
the
foreigner
may
go
back
again
but
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
evolution
of
the
country
will
be
different
another
feature
impressed
upon
me
was
the
emptiness
of
the
lives
of
the
people
education
was
rare
and
any
education
they
had
was
confined
to
the
chinese
classics
neither
of
the
three
men
i
had
with
me
could
read
or
write
the
thoughts
of
these
people
are
circumscribed
by
the
narrow
world
in
which
they
live
and
only
a
chance
traveler
such
as
myself
allows
them
a
glimpse
of
other
places
each
man
with
rare
exception
lives
and
labors
and
dies
where
he
is
born
that
is
his
ambition
and
in
the
midst
of
a
people
whose
whole
outlook
of
life
is
so
contracted
i
find
difficulty
in
believing
that
progress
such
as
japan
made
in
her
memorable
forward
movement
will
be
made
by
the
chinese
of
in
two
hundred
years
everything
one
can
see
around
him
here
at
this
town
of
seems
to
make
against
it
in
my
dealings
with
chinese
in
their
own
country
i
speak
broadly
i
have
found
that
they
know
everything
i
erected
a
in
some
months
ago
a
type
of
the
old
flat
handpress
not
unlike
that
first
used
by
caxton
it
was
a
part
of
the
equipment
of
the
ai
kueh
hsieh
tang
love
of
country
school
and
i
was
invited
by
the
gentry
to
erect
it
now
the
thing
had
not
been
up
an
hour
before
all
the
old
fossils
in
the
place
knew
all
about
it
printing
to
them
was
easy
a
child
could
do
it
it
is
always
o
ren
teh
o
ren
teh
i
know
i
know
these
men
dressed
in
their
best
stood
with
arms
behind
them
and
smiled
stupidly
as
i
labored
with
my
coat
off
fixing
their
primitive
machinery
yet
they
did
know
and
now
within
a
few
months
not
a
sheet
has
been
printed
and
the
whole
plant
is
going
to
rack
and
ruin
this
is
the
difference
between
the
chinese
and
the
tribespeople
of
here
we
see
the
god
of
the
missionary
again
quite
apart
from
any
religious
basis
the
tribesman
comes
and
lays
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
missionary
and
says
at
once
i
do
not
know
tell
me
and
i
will
follow
you
i
want
to
learn
that
is
why
it
is
that
the
chinese
stand
and
when
they
see
the
miao
making
strides
altogether
impossible
to
themselves
in
proportion
to
their
standard
of
civilization
and
this
position
of
things
will
not
be
altered
unless
they
cease
to
deceive
themselves
i
have
seen
a
miao
boy
of
nine
who
never
in
his
life
had
seen
a
chinese
character
who
did
not
know
that
school
existed
and
whose
only
tutoring
depended
on
the
week
visit
of
the
missionary
twice
a
year
i
have
seen
this
youngster
read
off
a
sheet
of
chinese
characters
no
chinese
boy
of
his
age
in
the
whole
city
would
succeed
in
i
have
not
been
brought
into
contact
with
any
other
tribe
as
i
have
with
the
hua
miao
but
if
the
progress
this
people
are
making
is
maintained
the
will
very
soon
be
left
behind
in
the
matter
of
practical
scholarship
these
miao
live
the
simplest
of
simple
lives
but
they
wish
to
become
better
to
live
purer
lives
to
become
civilized
to
be
uplifted
and
therefore
they
are
most
humble
most
approachable
and
are
slowly
evolving
into
a
happy
position
of
proud
independence
education
among
the
hua
miao
is
not
lost
among
the
chinese
much
of
the
labor
put
forward
in
endeavors
to
educate
them
is
lost
or
seems
to
bear
no
immediate
fruit
the
miao
are
living
by
confidence
and
hope
that
turns
towards
the
future
the
are
content
with
their
confidence
in
the
past
the
miao
however
were
not
like
this
always
but
a
few
years
ago
they
were
not
heard
of
outside
china
the
coming
emancipation
of
their
women
demands
some
attention
the
few
europeans
who
have
lived
among
the
multitudes
in
central
china
would
not
associate
beds
of
roses
with
the
lives
of
the
women
anywhere
the
daughter
is
seldom
happy
and
unless
the
wife
present
her
husband
with
sons
who
will
perpetuate
the
father
name
and
burn
incense
at
his
tablet
after
his
death
her
life
is
more
often
than
not
made
absolutely
unbearable
a
fact
more
than
any
other
one
thing
responsible
for
the
numerous
suicides
she
is
the
drudge
the
slave
of
the
man
and
the
popular
belief
is
that
all
the
women
of
the
middle
kingdom
are
essentially
chinese
but
little
is
heard
of
the
tribespeople
more
numerous
probably
than
in
any
other
given
area
in
all
the
world
whose
womankind
are
as
far
removed
from
the
chinese
in
language
habits
and
customs
as
english
ladies
of
are
removed
from
grecians
a
decade
or
so
ago
no
one
heard
of
the
miao
women
they
were
the
lowest
of
the
low
having
no
they
were
far
worse
off
than
their
chinese
sisters
who
no
matter
what
they
had
to
endure
after
marriage
were
certainly
safeguarded
by
law
and
etiquette
allowing
them
to
enter
the
married
state
with
respectability
but
no
social
laws
no
social
ties
protect
the
miao
women
until
a
few
years
ago
their
club
was
a
common
brothel
too
horrible
to
describe
in
the
english
language
as
soon
as
a
girl
gave
birth
to
her
first
child
she
came
down
on
the
father
to
keep
her
in
many
cases
it
is
only
fair
to
say
they
lived
together
faithfully
as
man
and
wife
although
such
cases
were
not
by
any
means
in
the
majority
the
poor
creatures
herded
together
in
their
unspeakable
vice
and
infamy
with
no
shame
or
common
modesty
fighting
for
the
wherewithal
to
live
and
only
by
chance
living
regularly
with
one
man
and
then
only
just
so
long
as
he
wished
little
girls
of
ten
and
over
regularly
attended
these
awful
hovels
and
children
grew
out
of
their
childhood
with
no
other
vision
than
that
of
entering
into
the
disgraceful
life
as
early
as
nature
would
allow
them
it
meant
little
less
than
that
practically
the
whole
of
the
population
was
illegitimate
viewed
from
a
western
standpoint
no
such
thing
as
marriage
existed
men
and
women
cohabited
in
this
horrible
orgy
of
existence
with
the
result
that
murder
disease
and
pestilence
were
rife
among
them
it
was
only
a
battle
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
to
pursue
so
terrible
a
life
nearly
all
the
people
were
diseased
by
the
transgression
of
nature
laws
after
a
time
however
through
the
instrumentality
of
protestant
missionaries
these
wretched
people
began
to
see
the
light
of
civilization
gradually
and
of
their
own
free
will
the
girls
gave
up
their
accursed
dens
of
misery
and
shame
and
the
men
lived
more
in
accord
with
social
law
and
order
the
miao
too
had
hitherto
been
dependent
for
their
literature
upon
the
chinese
character
which
only
a
few
could
understand
soon
they
had
literature
in
their
own
language
ae
and
a
great
social
reform
set
in
they
showed
a
desire
for
western
learning
such
as
has
seldom
been
seen
among
any
people
in
china
these
were
people
lowest
down
in
the
social
scale
and
now
the
latest
phase
is
the
establishment
of
bethrothal
and
marriage
laws
calculated
to
revolutionize
the
community
and
to
introduce
what
in
china
is
the
equivalent
for
home
life
betrothal
among
the
chinese
is
a
matter
with
which
the
parties
most
deeply
concerned
have
little
to
do
their
parents
engage
a
or
and
another
point
is
that
there
is
no
age
limit
not
so
now
with
the
christian
miao
no
paid
is
engaged
and
brides
are
to
be
at
a
minimum
age
of
eighteen
years
and
bridegrooms
twenty
the
establishment
of
these
laws
will
it
is
hoped
make
for
the
emancipation
from
a
life
of
the
most
dreadful
misery
of
thousands
of
women
in
one
of
the
darkest
countries
of
the
earth
af
but
now
the
miao
is
pressing
forward
under
his
burdens
to
guide
himself
in
the
struggle
to
retrieve
his
falls
and
his
failures
and
in
the
future
lies
his
hope
the
indomitable
hope
upon
which
the
interest
of
humanity
is
based
and
he
has
in
addition
the
grand
expectation
of
escaping
despair
even
in
death
it
is
all
the
praiseworthy
work
of
our
living
isolated
lives
among
the
people
building
up
a
worthy
christian
structure
upon
miao
simplicity
and
humble
fidelity
to
the
foreigner
but
i
digress
from
my
travel
little
out
of
the
ordinary
marked
my
travels
to
feet
an
easy
stage
my
meager
tiffin
at
an
insignificant
mountain
village
was
as
usual
an
educational
lesson
to
the
natives
each
tin
that
came
from
my
food
basket
one
servant
delighted
to
lay
out
the
whole
business
underwent
the
severest
criticism
tempered
with
unmeaning
eulogy
picked
up
and
put
down
by
perhaps
a
score
of
people
who
did
not
mean
to
be
rude
when
i
used
their
chopsticks
dirty
little
pieces
of
bamboo
in
a
manner
very
far
removed
from
their
natural
method
they
were
proud
of
me
outrageously
panegyric
references
were
made
when
an
old
man
scratching
at
his
disagreeable
under
my
nose
clipped
a
youngster
ear
for
hazarding
my
age
to
be
less
than
that
of
any
of
the
bystanders
the
length
of
my
moustache
and
a
growth
on
my
chin
giving
them
the
opinion
that
i
was
certainly
over
sixty
ag
i
entered
under
an
inauspicious
star
no
accommodation
was
to
be
had
all
the
inns
were
literally
overrun
with
sedan
chairs
and
filled
with
officials
already
busy
with
the
wash
basin
in
my
dirty
khaki
clothes
out
at
knee
and
elbow
looking
musty
and
mean
and
dusty
with
my
topee
botched
and
battered
i
presented
a
most
unhappy
contrast
as
i
led
my
pony
down
the
street
under
the
sarcastic
stare
of
bystanding
scrutineers
the
nights
were
cold
and
in
the
private
house
where
i
stayed
mercifully
overlooked
by
a
trio
of
protesting
effigies
with
visages
grotesque
and
gruesome
rats
ran
fearlessly
over
the
room
mud
floor
and
at
night
i
buried
my
head
in
my
rugs
to
prevent
total
disappearance
of
my
ears
by
nibbling
not
so
my
men
they
slept
a
few
feet
from
me
three
on
one
bench
two
on
another
bedding
was
not
to
be
had
and
so
among
the
dirty
straw
they
huddled
together
as
closely
as
possible
to
preserve
what
bodily
heat
they
had
snow
fell
heavily
in
the
early
morning
sunlight
on
january
the
undulating
valley
with
its
grand
untrodden
carpet
of
white
looked
magnificently
beautiful
as
i
picked
out
the
road
shown
me
by
a
poor
fellow
whose
ears
had
got
no
easy
work
was
it
climbing
tediously
up
the
narrow
footway
in
a
sharp
spur
rising
some
feet
in
a
ribbed
ascent
overlooking
a
fearful
drop
over
to
the
left
i
saw
an
unhappy
little
urchin
hardly
a
rag
covering
his
shivering
bleeding
body
grovelling
piteously
in
the
snow
while
his
blind
and
goitrous
mother
did
her
best
at
gathering
firewood
with
a
hatchet
the
pass
leading
over
this
range
through
which
the
white
crystalline
flakes
were
driven
wildly
in
one
face
was
a
of
smooth
rock
actually
worn
away
by
the
endless
tramping
of
myriads
of
who
then
were
plodding
through
ruts
of
steps
almost
as
high
as
their
haunches
a
man
with
a
diseased
hip
joined
me
thirty
li
farther
on
dismounting
from
his
pile
of
earthly
belongings
which
these
men
fix
on
the
backs
of
their
ponies
it
is
a
creditable
trapeze
act
to
effect
a
mount
after
the
pony
is
ready
for
the
journey
he
had
he
said
met
me
before
he
knew
that
i
was
a
missionary
and
had
heard
me
preach
he
remembered
my
wife
and
myself
and
children
passing
the
night
in
the
same
inn
in
which
he
stayed
on
one
of
his
pilgrimages
from
his
native
town
somewhere
to
the
east
of
the
province
i
had
never
seen
him
before
i
had
no
wife
i
have
never
preached
a
sermon
in
my
life
i
should
be
pained
ever
again
to
have
to
suffer
his
unmannerly
presence
anywhere
ponies
were
being
loaded
near
my
table
the
rapscallion
in
question
explained
that
the
black
blocks
were
salt
taking
a
pinch
from
my
with
his
grimy
fingers
to
add
point
to
his
remarks
i
kicked
at
a
couple
of
mongrels
under
the
rude
form
on
which
i
sat
they
fought
for
the
skins
of
those
pears
which
grow
here
so
prolifically
the
person
announced
that
they
were
dogs
and
that
an
idiosyncrasy
of
chinese
dogs
was
to
fight
several
wags
joined
in
and
all
appeared
through
the
traveling
nincompoop
to
know
all
about
my
past
and
present
lapsing
into
a
desultory
harangue
upon
all
men
and
things
foreign
the
street
reminded
me
of
clovelly
rugged
and
ragged
and
the
people
were
wrinkled
and
wretched
and
indeed
being
a
devonian
myself
by
birth
i
should
be
excused
of
wantonly
intending
to
hurt
the
delicate
feelings
of
the
lusty
sons
of
devon
were
i
to
declare
that
i
thought
the
life
not
of
a
very
terrible
dissimilarity
from
that
port
of
antiquity
in
the
west
salt
was
everywhere
much
more
like
coal
than
salt
certainly
as
black
the
blocks
were
stacked
up
by
the
sides
of
inns
ready
for
transport
carried
on
the
backs
of
a
multitude
of
poor
wretches
who
work
like
oxen
from
dawn
to
dusk
for
the
merest
pittance
on
the
backs
of
droves
and
droves
of
ponies
scrambling
and
spluttering
along
over
the
slippery
streets
all
day
long
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
easy
ascents
we
were
travelling
in
pleasantly
undulating
country
of
magnificence
my
men
dallied
i
tramped
on
alone
and
sitting
down
to
rest
on
the
rocks
i
realized
that
i
was
in
one
of
the
strangest
loneliest
wildest
corners
of
the
world
great
towered
around
me
white
and
sparkling
diadems
of
wondrous
beauty
and
at
my
feet
black
and
stirless
lay
a
silent
pool
reflecting
the
weird
shadows
of
my
coolies
flitting
like
specters
among
the
jagged
rocks
of
these
most
solitary
hills

the

better
than
any

the

however
has
stood

and
bids
fair
to
last
through

other
travelers
have
passed
over
it
since
the
days
of

but
i
should
like
to
say
a
word
about
it
twelve
yards
or
so
wide
and
no
less
than
yards
long
it
is
built
entirely
of
grey
stone
with
its
massive
piers
its
excellent
masonry
its
good
although
crude
carving
its
sculpturing
of
animals
at
either
end
its
decorative
triumphal
arches
its
masses
of
memorial
tablets
which
i
could
not
read
its
seven
arches
of
beautiful
simplicity
and
symmetry
and
perfect
proportion
it
would
have
been
a
credit
to
any
civilized
country
in
the
world
i
noticed
that
in
addition
to
cementing
the
stones
and
pillars
forming
the
sides
of
the
roadway
were
also
dovetailed
among
the
works
of
public
interest
with
which
successive
emperors
have
covered
china
the
bridges
are
not
the
least
remarkable
and
in
them
one
is
able
to
realize
the
perseverance
of
the
chinese
in
the
enormous
difficulties
of
construction
they
have
had
to
overcome
passing
over
the
stream
the
ho
i
believe
i
stepped
out
across
the
plain
with
one
foot
soaked
a
pony
having
pulled
me
into
the
water
as
he
drank
peas
and
beans
covered
with
snow
adjoined
a
road
which
led
up
to
a
long
winding
ascent
through
a
glade
overhung
by
hedgerows
where
the
sun
came
gently
through
and
breathed
the
sweet
coming
of
the
spring
from
midway
up
the
mountain
the
view
of
the
plain
below
and
the
fine
range
of
hills
separating
me
from
the
capital
was
one
of
exceeding
loveliness
the
undisturbed
white
of
the
snow
and
frost
sparkling
in
the
sunshine
contrasting
most
strikingly
with
the
darkened
waves
of
billowy
green
opposite
with
a
background
of
mountains
whose
summits
were
only
now
and
again
discernible
in
the
waning
morning
mist
snow
lay
deep
in
the
crevices
my
frozen
path
was
treacherous
for
walking
but
the
dry
crisp
air
gave
me
a
gusto
and
energy
known
only
in
high
latitudes
in
a
pass
cleared
out
from
the
rock
we
halted
and
gained
breath
for
the
second
ascent
surmounted
by
a
dismantled
it
has
long
since
fallen
into
disuse
the
sound
tiles
from
the
roof
having
been
appropriated
for
covering
other
habitable
dwellings
near
by
where
one
may
rest
for
tea
the
road
paved
in
some
places
worn
from
the
side
of
the
mountain
in
others
was
suspended
above
narrow
gorges
an
entrance
to
a
part
of
the
country
which
had
the
aspect
of
northern
regions
the
sun
tearing
open
the
curtain
of
blue
mist
inundated
with
brightness
one
of
the
most
beautiful
landscapes
it
is
possible
to
conceive
a
handful
of
dublin
fusiliers
with
rifles
concealed
in
the
hollows
of
the
heights
might
have
stopped
a
whole
army
struggling
up
the
but
no
one
appeared
to
stop
me
so
i
went
on
climbing
was
characteristic
of
the
day
is
about
feet
where
we
were
to
sleep
feet
not
much
of
a
difference
in
height
but
during
the
whole
distance
one
is
either
dropping
much
lower
than
or
much
higher
than
for
thirty
li
up
to
feet
there
is
little
to
revel
in
but
after
that
right
on
to
the
terrific
drop
to
our
destination
for
the
night
we
were
going
through
mountain
forests
than
which
there
are
none
better
in
the
whole
of
the
province
unless
it
be
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
tibetan
border
where
accompanying
scenery
is
altogether
different
from
a
height
of
feet
we
dropped
abruptly
through
clouds
of
thick
red
dust
which
blinded
my
eyes
and
filled
my
throat
down
to
the
city
of
i
went
down
behind
some
ponies
upwards
came
a
fellow
struggling
with
two
loads
of
crockery
and
in
the
narrow
pathway
he
stood
in
an
elevated
position
to
let
the
animals
pass
irony
of
fate
one
of
the
horses
it
seemed
most
intentional
gave
his
load
a
tilt
man
and
crockery
all
went
together
in
one
heap
to
a
crevice
thirty
yards
down
the
incline
and
as
i
proceeded
i
heard
the
choice
rhetoric
of
the
victim
and
the
muleteer
arguing
as
to
who
should
pay
just
before
that
i
dipped
into
the
very
bosom
of
the
earth
with
rugged
hills
rising
to
bewildering
heights
all
around
base
to
summit
clad
luxuriously
in
thick
greenery
of
mountain
firs
a
few
cedars
and
the
chinese
ash
black
patches
of
rock
to
the
right
were
the
of
many
a
swaying
giant
and
in
contrast
running
away
sunwards
a
silver
shimmer
on
the
unmoving
ocean
of
delicious
green
was
caused
by
the
slantwise
sun
reflections
while
in
the
ravines
on
the
other
side
a
dark
blue
haze
gave
no
invitation
fringes
stood
out
softly
against
the
eternal
blue
of
the
heavens
farther
on
eloquent
of
their
own
strength
and
imperturbability
were
deep
rocks
black
and
defiant
but
even
here
firs
grew
on
the
projecting
ledges
which
now
and
again
hung
menacingly
above
the
red
path
shading
away
the
sunlight
and
giving
to
the
dark
crevices
an
atmosphere
of
damp
and
cold
where
voices
echoed
and
like
weird
greetings
from
the
grave
onwards
again
and
from
the
cool
ravines
adorned
with
overhang
branches
forming
cosy
retreats
from
the
now
blazing
sun
one
emerged
to
a
road
leading
up
once
more
to
undiscovered
vastnesses
yonder
narrowed
a
gorge
fine
and
delicately
covered
pleasing
to
one
aesthetic
sense
the
center
was
a
dome
all
full
of
life
and
waving
leafage
ethereal
and
sweet
and
running
down
like
children
to
their
mother
were
numerous
little
hills
densely
clothed
in
a
green
lighter
and
more
dainty
than
that
of
the
parent
hill
throwing
graceful
curtsies
to
the
murmuring
river
at
the
foot
as
i
write
here
bathed
in
the
beauty
of
spring
sunlight
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
a
few
hours
since
the
thermometer
was
at
zero
little
spots
of
habitation
with
foodstuffs
growing
alongside
looking
most
lonely
in
their
patches
of
green
in
the
forest
added
a
human
and
sentimental
picturesqueness
to
a
scene
so
strongly
impressive
a
thatched
place
gave
us
rest
the
woman
producing
for
me
a
huge
chunk
of
palatable
rice
sprinkled
with
brown
sugar
little
naked
children
offspring
of
parents
themselves
covered
with
merest
hanging
rags
groped
round
me
and
treated
me
with
courteous
curiosity
goats
smelt
round
the
of
men
who
rested
on
low
forms
and
smoked
their
rank
tobacco
smoke
from
the
green
wood
fires
issued
from
the
mud
grates
where
receptacles
were
filled
with
boiling
water
ready
for
the
traveler
constantly
by
a
woman
whose
child
hung
over
her
back
moaned
piteously
for
the
milk
its
mother
was
too
busy
to
give
to
it
near
by
a
young
girl
gave
suck
to
a
deformed
infant
lucky
to
have
survived
its
birth
her
neck
was
as
big
as
her
breasts
merely
a
case
of
goitre
coolies
passed
panting
and
puffing
all
casting
a
curious
glance
at
him
to
whose
beneficence
all
were
willing
to
pander
at
tiffin
i
counted
wretched
people
who
turned
out
to
see
the
barbarian
they
desired
and
desired
importunately
to
touch
me
and
the
clothes
which
covered
me
and
i
submitted
this
place
was
interesting
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
lady
in
charge
of
the
buffet
could
speak
two
words
of
french
she
had
i
believe
acted
as
washerwoman
to
a
man
who
at
one
time
had
been
in
the
customs
at
mengtsz
great
excitement
ensued
among
the
perspiring
laborers
of
the
road
and
the
yokels
of
the
district
the
lady
was
so
goitrous
that
it
would
have
been
extremely
risky
to
hazard
a
guess
as
to
the
exact
spot
where
her
face
began
or
ended
and
here
in
a
place
where
with
all
her
neighbors
she
had
lived
through
a
period
noted
for
famine
for
rebellion
for
wholesale
death
and
murder
of
an
entire
village
she
endured
such
terrible
poverty
that
one
would
have
thought
her
spirit
would
have
waned
and
the
light
of
her
youth
burned
out
but
no
the
lusty
dame
was
still
sprightly
she
had
been
three
times
divorced
the
person
at
present
connected
with
her
in
the
bonds
of
wedded
life
also
goitrous
and
morally
repulsive
stood
by
and
gazed
down
upon
her
like
a
proud
bridegroom
he
resented
the
levity
of
shanks
and
his
companion
but
owing
to
the
detail
of
a
sightless
eye
he
could
not
see
all
that
transpired
however
we
were
all
happy
enough
charges
were
not
excessive
my
men
had
a
good
feed
of
rice
and
cabbage
with
the
usual
cabbage
stump
two
raw
rice
biscuits
which
they
threw
into
the
ashes
to
cook
and
when
cooked
picked
the
dirt
off
with
their
long
and
as
much
tea
as
they
could
drink
all
for
less
than
a
penny
there
is
something
in
traveling
in
where
the
people
away
from
the
cities
exhibit
such
painful
apathy
as
to
whether
dissolution
of
this
life
comes
to
them
soon
or
late
which
breeds
drowsiness
after
a
tramp
over
mountains
for
five
or
six
hours
on
end
one
naturally
needed
rest
as
i
sat
after
lunch
and
wrote
up
my
journal
i
nearly
fell
asleep
as
i
watched
the
reflections
of
all
these
figures
on
the
stony
roadway
and
dozed
meanwhile
one
rude
fellow
asked
my
man
whether
i
was
drunk
i
was
not
left
long
to
my
reverie
entering
into
a
conversation
intended
for
the
whole
village
to
hear
my
bulky
coolie
sublet
his
contract
for
two
tsien
for
the
eighty
li
we
had
already
done
fifty
the
man
hired
was
a
weak
thin
fellow
whose
body
and
soul
seemed
hardly
to
hang
together
he
was
the
first
to
arrive
as
soon
as
he
got
in
this
same
man
took
a
needle
from
the
inside
of
his
great
straw
hat
and
commenced
ridding
his
pants
of
somewhat
outrageous
perforations
such
is
the
chinese
coolie
although
in
he
would
be
an
exception
late
at
night
he
offered
to
put
a
shoe
on
my
pony
i
consented
he
did
the
job
providing
a
new
shoe
and
tools
and
nails
for
cash
just
about
twopence
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
children
i
had
seen
sad
for
the
babies
that
they
were
born
these
children
were
all
a
family
of
eternal
topsies
they
merely
grew
and
few
knew
how
they
are
rather
dragged
up
than
brought
up
to
live
or
die
as
time
might
appoint
babies
in
for
the
great
majority
are
not
coaxed
not
tossed
up
and
down
and
petted
not
soothed
not
humored
there
are
none
to
kiss
away
their
tears
they
never
have
toys
and
dream
no
young
dreams
but
are
brought
straight
into
the
iron
realities
of
life
they
are
reared
in
smoke
and
physical
and
moral
filth
and
become
men
and
women
when
they
should
be
children
they
haggle
and
envy
and
swear
and
murmur
when
in
or
even
in
the
whole
of
china
will
there
be
the
innocence
and
beauty
of
childhood
as
we
of
the
west
are
blessed
with
roads
here
were
in
many
cases
of
a
light
loess
and
some
of
red
limestone
rock
with
a
few
li
of
paved
roads
many
of
the
main
roads
over
the
loess
are
altered
by
the
rains
two
days
of
heavy
rain
will
produce
in
some
places
seas
of
mud
often
and
this
will
again
dry
up
quite
as
rapidly
with
the
next
sunshine
they
become
undermined
and
crumble
away
from
the
action
of
even
a
trickling
stream
so
as
to
become
always
unsafe
and
sometimes
quite
impassable
delays
are
very
dear
to
the
heart
of
every
chinese
the
traveler
if
he
is
desirous
of
getting
his
caravan
to
move
on
speedily
has
little
chance
of
success
unless
he
assumes
an
attitude
of
profoundest
indifference
to
all
men
and
things
around
him
never
to
be
in
a
hurry
we
are
accompanied
to
by
the
coolie
who
carried
the
load
yesterday
he
sits
by
staring
enviously
at
his
compatriots
in
the
employ
of
the
foreign
magnate
who
rests
on
a
stone
behind
and
listens
to
the
conversation
they
invite
him
to
carry
again
he
refuses
now
the
argument
natural
and
right
and
proper
is
ensuing
with
warmth
lao
chang
with
the
air
of
a
hsien
gwan
sits
in
judgment
upon
them
bringing
to
bear
his
long
experience
of
coolies
and
the
amount
of
they
receive
and
has
decided
that
the
fellow
should
receive
a
tenth
of
a
dollar
and
twenty
cash
in
addition
for
carrying
the
heavier
of
the
loads
the
remaining
thirty
li
as
against
ten
cents
offered
by
the
men
he
is
now
extending
philosophic
advice
to
them
all
based
on
a
knowledge
of
the
coolie
life
the
little
meeting
breaks
up
good
feeling
prevails
and
the
loads
carried
on
merrily
i
still
linger
sipping
my
tea
lao
chang
has
grumbled
because
he
has
had
to
shell
out
seven
cash
and
i
have
already
drunk
ten
cups
he
generally
uses
the
tea
leaves
afterwards
for
his
personal
use
but
wrangling
about
payment
prevails
always
where
chinese
congregate
in
china
by
high
and
low
lies
are
told
without
the
slightest
apparent
compunction
one
of
the
men
in
the
dispute
had
an
irrepressible
volubility
of
assertion
he
at
once
flew
into
a
temper
adopting
the
style
of
the
stage
actor
proclaiming
his
virtue
so
that
it
might
have
been
heard
at
he
was
preserving
his
face
for
in
this
country
temper
is
often
what
it
is
not
in
the
west
a
test
of
truth
among
westerners
nothing
is
more
insulting
sometimes
than
a
philosophic
temper
but
in
china
you
must
as
a
first
law
unto
yourself
protect
yourself
at
all
costs
and
against
all
comers
and
it
generally
requires
a
good
deal
of
noise
here
the
bully
is
not
the
coward
in
respect
of
prevarication
it
seems
to
be
absolutely
universal
the
poor
copy
the
vice
from
the
rich
it
seems
to
be
in
the
very
nature
of
the
people
and
although
it
is
hard
to
write
my
experience
convinces
me
that
my
statement
is
not
exaggeration
i
have
found
the
chinese
i
speak
of
the
common
people
for
in
my
travels
i
have
not
mixed
much
with
the
rich
the
greatest
romancer
on
earth
i
question
whether
the
great
preponderance
of
the
chinese
people
speak
six
consecutive
sentences
without
misrepresentation
or
exaggeration
tantamount
to
prevarication
regretting
that
i
have
to
write
it
i
give
it
as
my
opinion
that
the
chinese
is
a
liar
by
nature
and
when
he
is
confronted
with
the
charge
of
lying
the
culprit
seems
seldom
to
feel
any
sense
of
guilt
and
yet
in
business
above
the
petty
bargaining
business
we
have
as
the
antithesis
that
the
spoken
word
is
his
bond
i
would
rather
trust
the
chinese
merely
on
his
word
than
the
jap
with
a
signed
contract
the
chinese
knows
that
the
englishman
is
not
a
liar
and
he
respects
him
for
it
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
in
there
will
soon
be
seen
the
two
streams
of
civilization
which
now
flow
in
comparative
harmony
in
other
more
enlightened
provinces
flowing
here
also
in
a
single
channel
these
two
streams
of
the
east
and
the
west
represent
ideas
in
social
structure
in
government
in
standards
of
morality
in
religion
and
in
almost
every
human
conception
as
diverse
as
the
peoples
are
racially
apart
they
can
not
it
is
evident
live
together
the
one
is
bound
to
drive
out
the
other
or
there
must
be
such
a
modification
of
both
as
will
allow
them
to
live
together
and
be
linked
in
sympathies
which
go
farther
than
exploiting
the
country
for
initial
greed
the
chinese
will
never
lose
all
the
traces
of
their
inherited
customs
of
daily
life
of
habits
of
thought
and
language
products
which
have
been
borne
down
the
ages
since
a
time
contemporary
with
that
of
solomon
no
man
would
wish
it
and
it
is
at
once
impossible
the
language
for
instance
who
is
there
who
knows
anything
about
it
who
would
wish
to
see
the
chinese
character
drop
out
of
the
national
life
yet
it
is
bound
to
come
to
some
extent
and
in
future
ages
the
written
language
will
develop
into
pretty
well
the
same
as
latin
among
ourselves
romanization
although
as
yet
far
from
being
accomplished
must
sooner
or
later
come
into
vogue
as
is
patent
at
the
first
glance
at
business
if
commerce
in
the
interior
is
to
grow
to
any
great
extent
in
succeeding
generations
warranting
direct
correspondence
with
the
ports
at
the
coast
and
with
the
outside
world
the
chinese
hieroglyph
will
not
continue
to
suffice
as
a
satisfactory
means
of
communication
no
correspondence
in
chinese
will
ever
be
written
on
a
machine
such
as
i
am
now
using
to
type
this
manuscript
and
this
valuable
adjunct
of
the
office
must
surely
force
its
way
into
chinese
commercial
life
but
only
when
romanization
becomes
more
or
less
universal
this
however
by
the
way
my
point
is
that
no
matter
how
occidentalized
he
may
become
the
chinese
will
never
lose
his
national
characteristics
not
so
much
probably
as
the
japanese
has
done
what
the
youth
has
been
at
home
in
his
habits
of
thought
in
his
purpose
and
spirit
in
his
manifestation
of
action
will
largely
determine
his
after
life
chinese
mental
and
moral
history
has
so
stamped
certain
ineffaceable
marks
on
the
language
and
the
thought
and
character
of
her
people
that
china
will
never
even
were
she
so
inclined
obliterate
her
oriental
features
and
must
always
and
inevitably
remain
chinese
the
conflict
however
is
not
racial
it
is
a
question
of
civilization
were
it
racial
only
to
my
way
of
thinking
we
should
be
beaten
hopelessly
and
as
i
write
this
in
a
chinese
inn
in
the
heart
of
the
backward
province
surrounded
by
the
common
people
in
their
common
dirty
daily
doings
a
far
stretch
of
vivid
imagining
is
needed
to
see
these
people
in
any
way
approaching
the
westernization
already
current
in
eastern
provinces
of
this
dark
empire
this
is
what
i
wrote
sitting
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
during
my
tour
across
china
but
it
will
be
seen
in
other
parts
of
this
book
that
western
ideas
and
methods
of
progress
in
accord
more
with
european
standards
are
being
adopted
and
in
some
places
with
considerable
energy
even
in
the
backward
province
in
travel
anywhere
in
the
world
one
becomes
absorbed
more
or
less
with
one
own
immediate
surroundings
and
there
is
a
tendency
to
form
opinions
on
the
limitations
of
those
surroundings
in
many
countries
this
would
not
lead
one
far
astray
but
in
china
it
is
different
most
of
my
opinion
of
the
real
chinese
is
formed
in
and
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
in
all
the
other
seventeen
provinces
although
a
good
many
of
them
may
be
more
forward
in
the
trend
of
national
evolution
and
progress
the
same
squalidness
among
the
people
and
every
condition
antagonistic
to
the
westerner
education
so
often
referred
to
are
to
be
found
but
china
has
four
hundred
and
thirty
millions
of
people
so
that
what
one
writes
of
one
particular
province
in
the
main
right
perhaps
may
not
necessarily
hold
good
in
another
province
separated
by
thousands
of
miles
where
climatic
conditions
have
been
responsible
for
differences
in
general
life
with
its
great
area
and
its
great
population
it
does
not
need
the
mind
of
a
spencer
to
see
that
it
will
take
generations
before
every
acre
and
every
man
will
be
gathered
into
the
stream
of
national
progress
the
european
traveler
in
china
can
not
perhaps
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
dwelling
upon
the
absurdities
and
oddities
of
the
life
as
they
strike
him
but
there
is
also
another
side
to
the
question
our
own
civilization
presenting
so
many
features
so
extremely
removed
from
his
own
ancient
ideas
and
preconceived
notion
of
things
in
general
probably
looks
quite
as
ridiculous
from
the
standpoint
of
the
chinese
the
east
and
the
west
each
have
lessons
to
offer
the
other
the
west
is
offering
them
to
the
east
and
they
are
being
absorbed
and
perhaps
were
we
to
learn
the
lessons
to
which
we
now
close
our
eyes
and
ears
but
which
are
being
put
before
us
in
the
characteristics
of
oriental
civilization
we
may
in
years
to
come
sooner
than
we
expect
rejoice
to
think
that
we
have
something
in
return
for
what
we
have
given
it
may
save
us
a
rude
awakening
it
does
not
strike
the
average
european
who
has
never
been
to
china
and
who
knows
no
more
about
the
country
than
the
telegrams
which
filter
through
when
massacres
of
our
own
compatriots
occur
that
europe
and
america
are
not
the
only
territories
on
this
little
round
ball
where
the
inhabitants
have
been
left
with
a
glorious
heritage
but
i
was
speaking
of
my
men
delaying
on
the
road
to
when
they
laughed
at
my
impatience

one
as
he
held
out
a
huge
blue
bowl
of
white
wormlike
strings
and
a
couple
of
chopsticks
mien
it
should
be
said
is
something
like
vermicelli
a
tremendous
amount
of
it
is
eaten
and
in

without

is
dried
over
the

hung
from

to
pole
after
the
fashion
its
slipperiness
renders
the
long
boneless

most
difficult
of
efficient
adjustment
and
the
recollection
of
the
entertainment
my
comrades
received
as
i
struggled
to
get
a
decent
mouthful

to
me
still
after
that
i
hurried
on

off

and
suffered
a
nasty
experience
for
my
foolishness
when
nearing
the
city
inquiring
whether
my
men
had
gone
on
inside
the
walls
a
manure
coolie
liar
that
he
was
told
me
that
they
had
i
strode
on
again
encountering
the
crowds
who
blocked
the
roadway
as
market
progressed
who
stared
in
a
suspicious
manner
at
the
generally
disreputable
tired
and
dirty
foreigner
each
moment
i
expected
the
escort
to
arrive
i
could
not
sit
down
and
drink
tea
for
i
had
not
a
single
cash
on
my
person
i
could
speak
none
of
the
language
and
could
merely
push
on
with
ragtags
at
my
heels
becoming
more
and
more
embarrassed
by
the
pointing
and
staring
public
i
turned
but
could
see
none
of
my
men
i
managed
to
get
to
the
outer
gate
and
there
sat
down
on
the
grass
with
five
score
of
gaping
idiots
in
front
of
me
seeing
this
intruder
among
them
who
would
not
answer
their
simplest
queries
or
give
any
reason
for
being
there
suspicion
grew
worse
they
naturally
wanted
to
know
what
it
was
and
what
it
wanted
some
thought
i
might
be
deaf
and
raved
questions
in
my
ear
at
the
top
of
their
voices
even
then
i
remained
impotently
dumb
two
policemen
came
and
said
something
at
their
invitation
i
followed
them
and
found
myself
later
in
a
small
police
box
the
street
lined
with
people
facing
an
officer
the
man
hailed
me
in
speech
uncivil
he
was
huge
as
the
hyperborean
bear
and
cruel
looking
and
with
a
sort
of
apologetic
petitionary
growl
i
sidled
off
but
it
was
anything
but
comfortable
and
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
had
i
found
myself
being
led
off
to
the
yamen
after
a
i
was
thankful
to
see
the
form
of
my
men
appearing
at
the
moment
when
i
was
vehemently
expressing
indignation
at
not
being
understood
chapter
xvii
bumptious
contrasts
of
two
travelers
diminishing
respect
for
foreigners
in
the
far
the
european
maltreatment
of
on
the
way
to
and
repetition
met
in
chinese
home
and
careless
for
the
unit
of
the
city
of
decay
in
the
the
dead
to
eternal
kotowing
ceremony
and
its
ignorance
of
idyllic
peace
did
not
reign
at
where
i
rested
over
sunday
contacts
in
social
conditions
gave
rise
inevitably
to
causes
for
conflicts
arriving
early
my
men
were
able
to
secure
the
best
room
and
soon
after
with
much
imposing
pomp
and
show
a
gwan
ah
arrived
disgusted
that
he
had
to
take
a
lower
room
i
bowed
politely
to
him
as
he
came
in
he
did
not
return
it
however
but
stood
with
a
contemptuous
grin
upon
his
face
as
he
took
in
the
situation
i
do
not
know
who
the
person
was
neither
have
a
wish
to
trace
his
ancestry
but
his
bumptiousness
and
general
misbehavior
utterly
in
antagonism
to
national
etiquette
made
me
hate
the
sight
of
the
fellow
pride
has
been
said
to
make
a
man
a
hedgehog
i
do
not
say
that
this
man
was
a
hedgehog
altogether
but
he
certainly
seemed
to
wound
everyone
he
touched
he
had
with
him
a
great
retinue
an
extravagant
equipage
fine
clothes
and
presumably
a
great
fortune
but
none
of
this
offended
me
it
was
his
contempt
which
hurt
he
seemed
to
splash
me
with
mud
as
he
passed
and
was
altogether
badly
disposed
in
his
every
act
he
heaped
humiliation
upon
me
and
insulted
me
silently
and
gratuitously
with
unbearable
disdain
luckily
be
it
said
to
the
credit
of
the
chinese
government
one
does
not
often
meet
officials
of
this
kind
such
an
atmosphere
would
nurture
the
worst
feeling
it
is
of
course
possible
that
had
i
been
traveling
with
many
men
and
in
a
style
necessary
for
representatives
of
foreign
governments
this
hog
might
have
been
more
polite
but
the
fact
that
i
had
little
with
me
and
made
a
poor
sort
of
a
show
allowed
him
to
come
out
in
his
true
colors
and
display
his
unveneered
feeling
towards
the
foreigner
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
man
crossing
china
on
foot
was
evident
he
was
great
and
rich
that
was
the
sentiment
he
breathed
out
to
everyone
and
the
foreigner
was
humble
there
is
no
wrong
in
enjoying
a
large
superfluity
but
it
was
not
indispensable
to
have
displayed
it
to
have
wounded
the
eyes
of
him
who
lacked
it
to
have
flaunted
his
magnificence
at
the
door
of
my
commonplace
had
i
been
able
to
speak
i
should
have
pointed
out
to
this
fellow
that
to
know
how
to
be
rich
is
an
art
difficult
to
master
and
that
he
had
not
mastered
it
that
as
an
official
his
first
duty
in
exercising
power
was
to
learn
that
of
humility
and
that
it
is
the
irritating
authority
of
such
very
lofty
and
imperious
beings
as
himself
who
say
i
am
the
law
that
provokes
insurrection
however
i
was
dumb
and
could
only
return
his
contemptuous
glance
now
and
again
to
him
i
could
have
said
as
i
would
here
say
also
to
every
foreigner
in
the
employ
of
the
chinese
government
the
only
true
distinction
is
superior
worth
if
foreigners
in
china
are
to
have
social
and
official
rank
respected
they
must
begin
to
be
worthy
of
their
rank
otherwise
they
help
to
bring
it
into
hatred
and
contempt
it
is
a
pity
some
native
officials
have
to
learn
the
same
lesson
in
several
years
of
residence
in
the
far
east
i
have
noticed
respect
for
the
foreigner
unhappily
diminishing
the
root
of
the
evil
is
in
the
mistaken
idea
that
high
station
exempts
him
who
holds
it
from
observing
the
common
obligations
of
life
it
comes
about
so
often
have
i
seen
it
in
the
straits
settlements
and
in
various
parts
of
india
that
those
who
demand
the
most
homage
make
the
least
effort
to
merit
that
homage
they
demand
that
is
chiefly
why
respect
for
the
foreigner
in
the
orient
is
diminishing
and
i
have
no
hesitancy
in
asserting
that
the
average
european
in
the
east
and
far
east
does
not
treat
the
oriental
with
respect
he
considers
that
the
chinese
the
malay
the
burman
the
indian
is
there
to
do
the
donkey
work
only
the
newcomer
generally
discovers
in
himself
an
astounding
personal
omnipotence
and
even
before
he
can
talk
the
language
is
so
obsessed
with
it
that
as
he
grows
older
his
sense
of
it
broadens
and
deepens
and
in
china
of
the
chinese
this
is
true
as
in
other
spheres
of
the
far
east
the
native
is
there
to
do
the
donkey
work
and
does
it
contentedly
and
for
the
most
part
cheerfully
but
he
will
not
always
be
so
content
and
so
cheerful
he
will
not
always
suffer
a
leathering
from
a
man
whom
he
knows
he
dare
not
now
hit
back
ai
some
day
he
may
hit
back
we
have
seen
it
before
how
at
some
moment
by
some
interior
force
making
a
way
to
the
light
an
explosion
takes
place
there
is
an
upheaval
all
sorts
of
grave
disorders
and
because
some
europeans
are
killed
the
celestial
government
is
called
upon
to
pay
and
to
pay
heavily
indemnities
are
given
but
the
chinese
pride
still
feels
the
smart
pulling
away
up
the
sides
of
barren
sandy
hills
in
my
lonely
pilgrimage
i
could
see
wide
fertile
plains
sheltered
in
the
undulating
hollows
of
mountains
over
which
in
arduous
toil
i
vanished
and
how
or
where
i
could
hardly
calculate
suddenly
rounding
an
awkward
corner
a
magnificent
panorama
broke
upon
the
view
in
a
rolling
valley
watered
by
many
streams
below
all
green
with
growing
wheat
a
high
spur
about
midway
up
the
rolling
mountain
forms
a
capital
spot
for
wayfarers
to
stop
and
exchange
travelers
notes
a
couple
of
convicts
were
here
their
feet
manacled
and
their
white
cotton
clothing
branded
with
the
seal
of
death
by
the
side
were
the
crude
wooden
cages
in
which
they
were
carried
by
four
men
with
whom
they
mixed
freely
and
manufactured
coarse
jokes
in
six
days
bang
would
fall
the
knife
and
their
heads
would
roll
at
the
feet
of
the
executioners
at
coming
into
aj
the
stage
is
what
the
men
call
li
but
it
is
not
more
than
i
was
brought
to
an
insignificant
wayside
place
where
the
innkeeper
upbraided
my
boy
for
endeavoring
to
allow
me
to
pass
without
wetting
a
cup
at
his
bonny
hostelry
had
i
done
so
i
should
have
avouched
myself
utterly
indifferent
to
reputation
as
a
traveler
but
i
did
not
stay
the
night
here
i
passed
on
through
the
town
to
a
new
building
an
inn
into
which
i
peered
inquiringly
a
lad
came
courteously
forward
in
his
bowing
and
scraping
seeming
to
say
good
sir
we
most
willingly
embrace
the
opportunity
of
being
honored
with
your
noble
self
and
your
retinue
under
our
poor
roof
long
since
have
we
known
your
excellent
qualities
long
have
we
wished
to
have
you
with
us
we
can
have
no
reserve
towards
a
person
of
your
open
and
noble
nature
the
frankness
of
your
humor
delights
us
disburden
yourself
o
great
brother
here
and
at
once
of
your
paraphernalia
i
stayed
and
was
charged
more
for
lodging
than
at
any
other
place
in
all
my
wanderings
in
china
my
experience
was
different
from
that
of
major
davies
when
he
visited
this
city
in
he
writes
the
people
of
this
town
are
particularly
conservative
and
exclusive
they
have
such
an
objection
to
strangers
that
no
inn
is
allowed
within
the
city
walls
and
no
one
from
any
other
town
is
allowed
to
establish
a
shop
when
the
telegraph
line
was
first
taken
through
here
there
was
much
commotion
and
so
determined
was
the
opposition
of
the
townspeople
to
this
means
of
communication
that
the
telegraph
office
had
to
be
put
inside
the
colonel
yamen
the
only
place
where
it
would
be
safe
from
destruction
the
proprietor
of
the
inn
in
which
i
stayed
was
a
man
of
about
fifty
of
goodly
person
and
somewhat
corpulent
comely
presence
good
humor
and
privileged
freedom
he
had
a
pretty
daughter
he
was
an
exception
to
the
ordinary
father
in
china
in
the
fact
that
he
was
proud
of
her
as
he
was
of
his
house
and
his
faring
but
in
all
conscience
he
should
have
been
abundantly
ashamed
of
his
charges
for
my
boy
said
i
was
charged
three
times
too
much
and
i
have
no
cause
for
doubting
his
word
either
for
he
was
fairly
honest
i
once
had
a
boy
in
singapore
who
acted
for
three
weeks
as
a
ganti
ak
whilst
my
own
boy
underwent
a
surgical
operation
and
between
misreckonings
miscarriages
misdealings
mistakes
and
misdemeanors
had
he
remained
with
me
another
month
i
should
have
had
to
pack
up
lock
stock
and
barrel
and
clear
i
stayed
here
a
day
in
the
hope
of
getting
my
mail
but
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
only
the
bag
containing
it
it
was
sealed
and
the
postmaster
had
no
authority
to
break
that
seal
there
were
no
telegraph
poles
in
the
district
through
which
i
was
passing
the
connections
were
affixed
to
the
trunks
of
trees
the
telegraph
runs
right
across
the
plain
on
entering
which
one
crosses
a
rustic
bridge
just
below
a
rather
fine
pagoda
from
which
an
excellent
view
is
obtained
of
the
old
city
the
wall
up
towards
the
north
gate
where
there
is
another
pagoda
is
built
over
a
high
knoll
inside
the
wall
half
the
town
is
uncultivated
ground
four
youngsters
here
were
having
a
great
time
on
the
back
of
a
lazy
buffalo
who
turning
his
head
swiftly
to
get
rid
of
some
irritating
bee
dislodged
the
quartet
to
the
ground
where
they
fought
and
cursed
each
other
over
the
business
everything
that
one
sees
around
here
is
particularly
chinesey
it
may
be
supposed
that
i
am
not
the
first
person
who
has
gone
through
town
after
town
and
found
in
all
that
he
looks
at
particularly
the
houses
certain
forms
identical
inevitable
exasperating
by
common
repetition
it
has
been
said
that
poetry
is
not
in
things
it
is
in
us
but
in
china
very
little
poetry
comes
into
the
homes
and
lives
of
the
common
millions
they
are
all
dead
even
the
best
bare
homes
without
life
or
brightness
among
the
of
the
west
there
is
to
be
found
a
kind
of
ministering
beauty
which
makes
its
way
everywhere
springing
from
the
hands
of
woman
when
the
dwelling
is
cramped
the
purse
limited
the
table
modest
a
woman
who
has
the
gift
finds
a
way
to
make
order
and
puts
care
and
art
into
everything
in
her
house
puts
a
soul
into
the
inanimate
and
gives
those
subtle
and
winsome
touches
to
which
the
most
brutish
of
human
beings
is
sensible
but
in
china
woman
does
nothing
of
this
her
life
is
unaesthetic
to
the
last
degree
no
happy
improvisations
or
touches
of
the
stamp
of
personality
enter
her
home
one
can
not
trace
the
touches
of
witchery
in
the
tying
of
a
ribbon
everywhere
you
find
the
same
class
of
furniture
and
garniture
the
same
shape
of
table
of
stool
of
form
of
bed
of
cooking
utensils
of
picture
of
everything
and
all
the
details
of
her
housekeeping
are
so
apathetically
uninteresting
the
chinese
woman
has
no
charming
art
rather
is
it
a
common
horrid
daily
grind
she
is
not
as
the
woman
should
be
the
interpreter
in
her
home
of
her
own
grace
and
she
differs
from
her
western
sister
in
that
it
is
impossible
for
her
to
express
in
her
dress
also
the
little
personalities
of
character
all
is
eternally
the
same
but
i
know
so
very
little
of
ladies
clothing
and
therefore
cease
quarrying
was
going
on
high
up
among
the
hills
as
i
left
the
city
men
were
out
of
sight
but
their
hammering
was
heard
distinctly
as
each
boulder
was
freed
these
wielders
of
the
hammer
yelled
to
to
look
out
for
their
heads
gave
the
stone
a
push
to
start
it
rolling
and
if
it
rolled
upon
you
it
was
your
own
fault
and
not
theirs
you
should
have
seen
to
it
that
you
were
somewhere
else
at
the
time
if
it
blocked
the
pathway
another
had
to
be
made
by
those
who
made
the
traffic
directly
under
the
quarry
i
was
accosted
by
a
beggar
old
foreign
man
old
foreign
man
he
yelled
stones
were
falling
fast
it
is
possible
that
he
does
not
sit
there
now
physiognomists
do
not
swarm
in
china
there
is
grand
scope
for
someone
there
would
be
ample
material
for
research
for
the
student
in
the
soldiers
alone
who
would
be
sent
to
guard
him
from
place
to
place
he
would
not
need
to
go
farther
afield
for
he
would
be
given
fat
men
and
lean
men
brave
men
and
cowards
some
blessed
with
brains
and
some
not
one
whit
brainy
civil
and
surly
stubby
and
lanky
but
rogues
and
liars
all
travelers
are
always
interested
in
their
chairmen
oftentimes
my
interest
in
them
was
greater
than
theirs
in
me
until
the
time
came
for
us
to
part
then
the
al
always
in
view
from
the
outset
of
their
duty
brought
us
in
a
manner
nearer
to
each
other
as
i
came
out
of
the
inn
at
somewhat
hurriedly
for
my
men
lingered
long
over
the
rice
i
stumbled
over
the
yamen
fellow
who
crouched
by
the
doorside
he
laughed
heartily
had
i
fallen
on
him
his
tune
might
have
been
changed
but
no
matter
this
unit
of
the
city
humanity
was
not
bewilderingly
beautiful
he
was
profoundly
very
goitrous
and
ravages
of
had
bequeathed
to
him
a
wonderful
facial
ugliness
he
had
however
be
it
written
to
his
honor
learnt
that
life
was
no
theory
one
could
see
that
at
a
glance
as
he
walked
along
at
the
head
of
the
procession
with
a
stride
like
an
ox
manfully
shouldering
his
absurd
weapon
of
office
which
in
the
place
of
a
gun
was
an
immense
carved
wooden
mace
not
unlike
a
leg
of
the
wooden
bedstead
of
antiquity
his
ugliness
was
embittered
somewhat
by
sunken
toothless
jaws
and
an
enigmatical
stare
from
a
he
was
also
and
as
an
erstwhile
gunpowder
worker
had
lost
two
fingers
and
a
large
part
of
one
ear
but
he
had
learnt
the
secret
of
simple
duty
he
had
no
dreams
no
ambition
embracing
vast
limits
did
not
appear
to
wish
to
achieve
great
things
unless
it
were
that
in
his
fidelity
to
small
things
he
laid
the
base
of
great
achievements
he
waited
upon
me
hand
and
foot
he
burned
with
ardor
for
my
personal
comfort
and
he
did
not
complicate
life
by
being
engrossed
in
anything
which
to
him
was
of
no
concern
his
only
concern
was
the
foreigner
and
towards
me
he
carried
out
his
duty
faithfully
and
to
the
letter
i
would
wager
that
that
man
ugly
of
face
and
form
but
most
kindly
disposed
to
one
who
could
communicate
little
but
dumb
approval
was
an
excellent
citizen
an
excellent
father
an
excellent
son
so
very
different
was
another
traveler
who
unceremoniously
forced
himself
upon
me
with
the
inevitable
ching
fan
ching
fan
although
he
had
no
food
to
offer
he
commenced
with
a
eulogium
of
my
ambling
palfrey
rusty
who
limped
along
leisurely
behind
me
so
far
as
he
could
remember
poor
ignorant
ass
he
had
never
seen
a
pony
like
it
in
his
extensive
travels
probably
from
to
if
so
far
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
rusty
had
wrenched
his
right
fore
fetlock
between
a
gully
in
the
rocks
the
day
before
and
was
now
going
lame
dressed
fairly
respectably
in
the
universal
blue
my
unsought
companion
was
of
middle
stature
strongly
built
but
so
clumsily
as
to
border
almost
on
deformity
and
to
give
all
his
movements
the
ungainly
awkwardness
of
a
man
he
walked
with
a
limp
was
suffering
like
myself
with
sore
feet
if
not
that
it
was
something
incomparably
worse
not
for
a
moment
throughout
the
day
did
he
leave
my
side
the
only
good
point
about
him
being
that
when
we
drank
tea
of
course
he
vainly
begged
to
be
allowed
to
pay
in
that
he
was
the
shadow
of
some
of
my
friends
of
younger
days
but
of
men
enough
from
on
to
the
whole
country
bears
lamentable
signs
of
gradual
ruin
and
decay
a
falling
off
from
better
times
the
former
city
is
probably
the
most
important
point
on
the
route
and
is
mentioned
as
a
likely
point
for
the
proposed
railway
the
country
has
never
recovered
from
the
terrible
effects
of
the
great
mohammendan
rebellion
of
foundations
of
once
imposing
buildings
still
stand
out
in
fearful
significance
and
ruins
everywhere
over
the
barren
country
tell
plain
tales
all
too
sad
of
the
good
days
gone
temples
originally
fit
for
the
largest
city
in
the
empire
with
elaborate
wood
and
stone
carving
and
costly
weird
images
sculptured
in
stone
with
particularly
fine
specimens
of
those
buddhistic
hells
and
their
presiding
monsters
with
miniature
ornamental
pagodas
and
intricate
archways
are
all
now
unused
and
when
the
people
need
material
for
any
new
building
seldom
erected
now
in
this
district
the
temple
grounds
are
robbed
still
more
in
the
days
of
its
prosperity
must
have
been
a
fair
land
indeed
bright
smiling
seductive
now
it
is
the
exact
antithesis
and
the
people
live
sad
flat
colorless
existences
for
three
days
my
caravan
was
preceded
by
twelve
men
headed
by
a
sort
of
gaffer
with
a
gong
carrying
a
corpse
in
a
massive
black
coffin
elaborate
in
red
and
blue
silk
drapings
and
with
the
inevitable
white
cock
presiding
one
leg
tied
with
a
couple
of
strands
of
straw
to
the
cover
on
which
it
crowed
lustily
their
mission
was
an
honorable
one
carrying
the
honored
dead
to
its
last
bed
of
rest
eternal
for
this
dead
man
had
secured
the
fulfillment
of
the
highest
in
human
destiny
to
have
his
bones
buried
near
the
scene
of
his
youth
near
his
home
this
is
a
simple
custom
the
chinese
cherish
and
reverence
of
highest
honor
to
the
dead
and
of
no
mean
value
to
the
living
to
the
dead
because
buried
near
the
home
of
his
fathers
he
would
not
be
subject
to
those
delusive
temptations
in
the
future
state
of
that
confused
and
complex
life
to
the
living
because
it
gave
work
to
a
dozen
men
for
several
days
and
enabled
them
to
have
a
good
time
at
the
expense
of
the
departed
a
perpetual
and
excruciatingly
unmusical
chant
in
keeping
with
the
occasion
sadness
rent
the
mountain
air
interrupted
only
when
the
bearers
lowered
the
coffin
and
left
the
remains
of
the
great
dead
on
a
pair
of
trestles
in
the
roadway
whilst
they
drank
to
his
happiness
above
and
smoked
tobacco
which
the
relatives
had
given
them
once
this
of
chinese
merit
am
was
dumped
unceremoniously
on
the
turf
while
the
headman
entered
into
a
blackguarding
contest
with
one
of
the
fellows
who
was
alleged
to
be
constantly
out
of
step
with
his
brethren
because
he
was
a
much
smaller
man
the
gaffer
gave
him
a
bit
of
a
drubbing
for
his
insolence
rain
came
on
at
a
small
town
of
about
three
hundred
houses
where
i
sought
shelter
in
the
last
house
of
the
street
the
householder
a
shrivelled
goitrous
humpback
received
me
kindly
removed
his
pot
of
cabbage
from
the
fire
to
brew
tea
for
his
uninvited
guest
and
showed
great
gratitude
to
such
an
extent
that
he
nearly
fell
into
the
fire
as
he
moved
to
push
the
children
forward
towards
me
when
i
gave
a
few
cash
to
three
kiddies
who
gaped
at
the
apparition
thus
found
unexpectedly
before
their
parent
hearth
more
came
in
my
beneficent
attention
being
modestly
directed
towards
them
others
followed
and
still
more
and
more
whilst
the
man
removing
from
his
mouth
his
pipe
and
wiping
the
mouthpiece
with
his
soiled
before
offering
it
to
me
to
smoke
smiled
as
i
distributed
more
cash
they
are
all
mine
he
said
cutely
poor
fellow
there
must
have
been
a
dozen
nippers
there

i
sighed
at
the
thought
of
what
some
men
come

of
an
ancestral
tablet
brought
into
the
street
for
the
purpose
a
horrid
din
made
the
air
turbulent
i
sought
refuge
in
the
nearest
house
tying
my
ponies
up
to
the
windows
and
was
most
hospitably
received
as
a
returned
prodigal
by
a
old
man
and
his
courtly
helpmate
the
genuineness
of
the
hospitality
of
the
chinese
is
as
strong
as
their
unfriendliness
can
be
when
they
are
disposed
to
show
a
hostile
spirit
to
foreigners
just
as
i
had
laid
up
for
dinner
the
din
stopped
we
breathed
gunpowder
smoke
instead
of
air
everyone
from
the
ceremony
came
around
me
and
there
lingered
in
silent
admiration
my
boy
came
and
whispered
quite
aloud
enough
for
all
to
hear
that
in
that
part
of
the
town
cooked
rice
could
not
be
bought
and
that
i
was
going
to
be
left
to
look
after
the
horses
and
the
loads
whilst
the
men
went
away
to
feed
he
advised
the
assembled
crowd
that
if
they
valued
sound
physique
they
had
better
keep
their
hands
off
my
gear
and
depart
my
friendly
host
shut
the
doors
and
windows
with
the
exception
of
that
through
which
i
watched
our
impedimenta
and
at
once
commenced
inquiry
into
my
past
and
concerning
vicissitudes
of
life
in
general
luckily
i
was
able
to
give
the
old
man
good
reason
for
congratulating
me
upon
my
ancestral
line
my
own
great
age
the
number
of
my
wives
and
offshoots
mostly
little
puppies
and
as
each
curious
caller
dropped
in
to
sip
tea
so
did
one
after
another
of
the
patriarchal
dignitaries
who
were
responsible
for
the
human
product
then
entertaining
the
crowd
come
vividly
before
the
imagination
of
the
company
and
they
were
graced
with
every
token
of
age
and
honor
chinese
speak
of
sons
as
little
puppies
footnote
ao
in
crossing
a
river
here
i
slipped
and
from
ray
pocket
there
rolled
a
box
of
photographic
films
and
in
reaching
over
to
it
i
let
my
loaded
camera
fall
into
the
water
i
was
disappointed
as
most
of
my
best
pictures
were
thus
as
i
imagined
spoilt
but
when
i
developed
at
bhamo
i
found
not
a
single
film
damaged
by
water
and
every
picture
was
a
success
from
both
the
roll
in
the
tin
and
the
roll
in
the
camera
it
is
a
tribute
to
the
company
that
their
films
will
stand
being
dipped
into
rivers
and
remain
unaffected
the
films
in
question
should
have
been
developed
six
months
prior
to
the
date
of
my
chapter
xviii
of
frightened
the
eagle
acrobatic
performance
and
some
retaliation
at
the
author
the
mountains
to
a
magnificent
storm
and
a
a
rock
of
ages
hardiness
of
my
morning
routine
and
some
filth
of
the
people
of
the
of
the
towards
chinese
anthropological
craniological
and
antediluvian
day
of
in
bitter
cold
unable
to
procure
in
middle
timely
of
a
bullock
on
my
disposition
of
the
capital
of
an
roads
and
good
virtue
of
unfailing
consumption
of
diseased
animals
minchia
at
davies
and
the
differences
of
opinion
increasing
popularity
of
the
small
but
the
storm
came
the
next
day
as
we
were
on
our
way
to
during
the
ninety
li
when
we
passed
the
highest
point
on
this
journey
by
name
the
eagle
nest
barrier
this
elevated
pass
feet
above
the
level
reached
after
a
gradual
ascent
between
two
mountain
ranges
was
surmounted
after
a
couple
of
hours
steep
climbing
where
rain
and
snow
had
made
the
paths
irritatingly
slippery
and
the
task
most
laborious
although
the
condition
of
the
road
was
enough
to
take
all
the
wind
out
of
one
sails
the
sublimity
of
the
scenery
of
the
dense
woods
which
clothed
the
mountains
exquisitely
pretty
ravines
tumbling
waterfalls
running
rivulets
and
sparkling
brooks
with
little
patches
of
snow
hidden
away
in
the
maze
of
greens
of
every
hue
all
rendered
it
a
climb
less
tiring
than
the
narrow
pathways
over
which
we
were
then
to
travel
up
we
met
a
string
of
ponies
and
i
underwent
a
few
nervous
moments
until
they
had
passed
in
the
road
a
slight
tilt
a
slip
a
splutter
probably
a
yell
and
i
should
have
dropped
feet
without
a
bump
as
we
went
along
together
just
before
reaching
this
hill
we
saw
women
carrying
bags
of
rice
they
saw
us
too
one
passed
me
safely
but
with
fear
the
others
carelessly
dropping
their
burdens
scampered
off
afraid
of
their
lives
and
when
one
of
my
soldiers
whose
sense
of
humor
was
on
a
par
with
my
own
when
as
a
boy
i
used
to
stick
butterscotch
drops
on
the
bald
head
of
my
sunday
school
teacher
and
bend
pins
for
small
boys
to
sit
on
and
rise
from
shouted
to
them
they
dived
straight
as
a
die
over
the
hedge
into
a
submerged
and
made
a
sorry
spectacle
with
their
lily
feet
and
pale
blue
trousers
covered
with
the
thin
mud
in
struggling
to
get
away
one
of
them
the
silly
creature
went
sprawling
on
all
fours
in
the
slime
and
with
only
the
imperfect
footing
possible
to
her
with
her
little
stumps
she
would
have
been
submerged
had
not
the
man
who
had
frightened
her
at
my
bidding
gone
to
drag
her
out
as
it
was
they
looked
anything
but
beautiful
with
their
wet
and
muddy
garments
clinging
tightly
to
their
bodies
and
betraying
every
curve
of
their
not
unbeautiful
figures
one
of
the
women
a
comely
damsel
of
some
twenty
summers
did
not
jump
into
the
field
but
lay
flat
on
the
ground
behind
some
bushes
thereby
hoping
to
get
out
of
sight
and
now
came
forward
with
amorous
glances
we
however
sent
them
on
their
way
and
i
will
lay
my
life
that
they
will
not
scoot
at
the
sight
of
the
next
foreigner
and
now
we
are
at
the
nest
many
travelers
have
made
remarks
upon
this
place
where
i
was
waited
upon
by
a
shrivelled
shambling
specimen
of
manhood
whose
wife
in
contrast
to
her
kind
in
china
seemed
to
rule
house
and
home
bed
and
board
whilst
we
were
there
a
chinese
bound
on
the
downward
journey
endeavored
to
mount
his
mule
at
the
very
moment
the
animal
was
reaching
out
for
a
blade
of
straw
as
he
swung
his
leg
across
the
mule
took
another
step
forward
and
the
rider
fell
bodily
with
an
enormous
bump
into
the
lap
of
one
of
my
coolies
upsetting
him
and
his
bowl
of
tea
over
his
trousers
and
my
own
i
could
not
suppress
hearty
approval
of
this
acrobatic
incident
but
the
end
was
not
yet
i
sat
on
one
end
of
one
of
those
narrow
forms
and
this
same
coolie
sat
on
the
other
he
rose
up
suddenly
reached
over
for
the
common
and
i
came
off
with
the
multitude
of
alfresco
diners
laughing
at
this
smart
retaliation
until
their
mouths
emitted
the
grains
of
rice
they
chewed
after
that
i
cleared
off
descending
through
a
fertile
valley
from
the
bottom
there
loomed
upwards
higher
mountains
looking
black
and
dismal
with
clouds
black
and
dismal
keeping
them
company
we
had
now
to
cross
the
undulating
ground
still
separating
us
from
the
early
portion
of
the
ground
was
something
like
clifton
downs
something
like
dartmoor
the
country
was
poor
and
the
people
barely
put
themselves
out
to
boil
water
for
chance
travelers
the
storm
broke
suddenly
from
the
shelter
of
a
hollowed
rock
i
watched
it
all
over
the
submerged
plain
and
the
bare
hills
the
blackness
was
as
of
night
red
earth
without
the
sun
looked
brown
brown
looked
black
and
the
trees
swaying
helplessly
before
the
raging
fury
of
the
gale
seemed
struck
by
death
lightning
continued
its
electrical
vividity
of
greenish
white
among
the
heavy
clouds
drooping
threateningly
from
the
to
the
darkened
valleys
below
laden
still
with
their
waiting
unshed
deluge
through
a
narrow
incision
in
the
cruel
clouds
the
sun
peeped
out
with
a
nervous
timidity
and
a
tiny
patch
over
yonder
in
a
flash
illuminated
with
gold
and
purple
across
which
the
lightning
danced
in
heavenly
rivalry
displayed
the
magic
touch
of
the
artist
of
the
skies
then
came
a
rainbow
of
sweetest
of
a
splendor
glorious
and
exquisite
delicate
as
the
breath
from
paradise
stretching
its
majestic
archbow
athwart
the
waning
gloom
from
range
to
range
as
one
drank
in
the
glimpses
of
that
dark
corner
in
this
peculiar
fairyland
a
mighty
peal
of
magnificent
stentorian
clashing
broke
finally
upon
me
and
heaven
electricity
again
flitted
fearfully
over
the
earth
aslant
upwards
downwards
again
upwards
again
disappearing
over
the
unmoved
hills
like
a
thousand
tortured
souls
fleeing
from
dante
hades
and
here
i
sit
on
in
that
veritable
rock
of
ages
cleft
for
me
glad
that
no
human
touch
save
that
of
my
own
mean
clay
that
no
human
voice
came
between
me
and
the
voice
of
that
infinite
beyond
i
seemed
to
have
been
standing
on
the
verge
of
another
world
another
great
unknown
the
heavens
raged
and
the
thunders
thereof
roared
and
the
wild
wind
hissed
and
moaned
and
wailed
the
hopeless
wail
of
a
lonely
tormented
soul
the
cold
was
intense
and
through
it
all
i
sat
drenched
to
the
skin
on
the
bleak
mountain
thus
i
was
the
pitifulest
atom
of
loneliest
humanity
yet
felt
no
loneliness
the
face
of
the
earth
frowned
in
angry
fury
the
awfulness
of
the
raging
elements
dwarfed
all
else
to
utter
annihilation
but
even
at
such
a
time
coming
all
too
seldom
in
the
lives
of
most
of
us
when
standing
in
some
remote
spot
which
still
tells
forth
the
story
of
the
world
youth
one
inmost
nature
thrills
with
a
sense
of
unison
with
it
all
beyond
human
expression
all
was
so
grand
inspiring
one
with
an
awe
beyond
one
comprehension
a
peculiar
dread
of
one
own
earthly
insignificance
these
pictures
graven
in
memory
with
the
strong
pencil
of
our
common
mother
are
indelible
yet
quite
beyond
expression
as
in
our
own
souls
we
can
not
frame
in
words
our
deepest
life
emotions
so
as
we
penetrate
into
the
depths
of
that
kindly
common
mother
of
us
all
we
find
human
words
the
same
utterly
futile
channel
of
expression
to
have
our
souls
tuned
to
this
silent
eloquence
of
nature
to
catch
the
sweetness
of
those
mountains
to
understand
the
unspoken
messages
of
those
rushing
rivers
and
those
gigantic
gorges
to
feel
the
of
nature
and
her
beauty
in
perfect
harmony
with
all
that
is
best
within
us
we
must
be
silent
undisturbed
preferably
alone
this
is
not
flowery
sentiment
it
is
what
every
true
lover
of
old
and
lovely
nature
would
feel
in
western
china
yet
still
unspoiled
by
the
taint
of
absorbing
stream
of
civilization
and
in
the
stress
of
modern
life
and
the
progress
of
man
monopolization
of
the
earth
on
which
he
lives
it
is
beautiful
to
some
of
us
of
whom
it
may
be
said
the
highest
state
of
inward
happiness
comes
from
solitary
meditation
in
unperturbed
loneliness
under
the
broad
expanse
of
heaven
to
know
that
there
are
still
some
spots
of
isolation
where
human
foot
has
never
turned
the
clay
and
where
out
of
sight
and
sound
of
fellow
mortals
we
may
even
for
a
time
shake
off
the
violating
unnatural
fetters
of
a
harassing
western
life
soon
it
seemed
as
if
a
silken
cord
had
suddenly
been
severed
and
i
had
been
dragged
from
a
world
of
sweet
infinitude
down
to
a
sphere
mundane
and
everyday
to
something
i
had
known
before
what
is
nature
ha
why
do
i
not
name
thee
god
art
thou
not
the
garment
of
god
o
heaven
is
it
in
very
deed
he
then
that
ever
speaks
through
thee
that
lives
and
loves
in
thee
that
lives
and
loves
in
me
ap
i
heard
the
crack
of
the
bamboo
and
the
patter
of
feet
in
the
sodden
slippery
pathway
and
i
knew
my
men
were
come
crawling
out
from
my
rock
i
descended
again
to
common
things
having
to
listen
to
the
disgusting
talk
of
my
chinese
followers
though
a
very
slender
vocabulary
saved
me
from
losing
entirely
the
memory
of
that
great
picture
then
passing
away
the
sun
shone
through
the
clouds
which
had
given
place
again
to
blue
the
pervading
blackness
of
a
few
moments
before
had
disappeared
and
with
the
sinking
sun
we
descended
thoughtfully
to
the
town
the
hill
is
solid
sandstone
and
the
uneven
ruts
made
by
the
daily
procession
of
ponies
were
transformed
into
a
network
of
tiny
streams
that
my
comrades
were
drenched
to
the
skin
gave
them
no
thought
they
turned
to
immediately
while
i
dived
hurriedly
to
the
bottom
of
my
box
and
gulped
down
quinine
they
sat
around
and
drank
hot
water
holding
forth
with
eloquence
beyond
their
wont
on
the
general
advantages
naturally
and
supernaturally
of
their
native
city
of
and
well
they
might
for
i
know
no
prettier
spot
in
the
whole
of
western
china
fifty
men
coolies
who
were
carrying
general
merchandise
in
all
directions
and
who
had
taken
shelter
in
the
large
inn
i
stayed
at
rose
with
me
the
next
morning
as
i
ate
my
morning
meal
spluttering
the
rice
over
the
floor
as
i
tried
vainly
to
control
my
chopsticks
with
fingers
they
went
through
the
filthy
round
of
early
morning
routine
squatting
about
with
their
dirty
and
a
of
greasy
water
in
their
brass
receptacle
shaped
like
the
of
civilization
and
leaving
upon
their
necks
the
traces
of
their
swills
they
wiped
the
dirt
into
their
hair
and
considered
they
had
washed
themselves
men
would
emerge
from
their
rooms
fully
dressed
with
the
dishclout
in
one
hand
and
the
in
the
other
on
the
way
to
their
morning
tub
oh
the
filth
the
unspeakable
filth
of
these
people
would
that
the
chinese
would
emulate
the
cleanliness
of
the
japs
though
even
that
i
would
question
in
several
years
in
the
orient
i
have
not
yet
come
across
the
cleanliness
in
any
race
of
people
to
be
compared
with
that
cleanliness
which
in
england
is
next
to
godliness
the
people
of
were
pleased
to
see
me
they
hurried
about
obligingly
to
get
food
for
man
and
beast
and
the
womankind
poor
but
cracked
suggestive
jokes
with
my
men
with
the
utmost
freedom
in
this
town
there
are
many
lolo
it
might
be
said
that
the
entire
population
is
of
lolo
origin
although
had
i
suggested
to
any
particular
inhabitant
that
this
was
a
fact
he
would
probably
have
taken
keen
offense
and
things
might
have
gone
badly
with
me
with
the
men
it
is
most
difficult
to
tell
there
is
little
difference
between
the
and
the
tribesman
but
the
difference
is
often
most
marked
in
respect
to
the
women
the
chinese
woman
has
a
considerably
fairer
skin
than
the
female
of
lolo
descent
and
her
customs
and
manners
apart
from
the
distinct
colloquial
accent
are
quite
evident
as
pretty
sure
proof
of
distinction
of
race
after
the
lolo
have
mingled
with
the
chinese
for
a
few
years
however
it
is
quite
difficult
to
differentiate
between
them
as
most
of
the
lolo
women
now
speak
chinese
in
this
town
i
did
not
hear
any
language
foreign
to
the
chinese
language
and
a
good
many
of
the
men
are
sufficiently
educated
to
read
the
chinese
character
even
if
they
do
not
write
it
the
forward
racial
condition
of
the
lolo
people
in
this
district
is
far
greater
than
that
of
the
people
of
the
same
tribe
to
the
west
of
and
in
latitudes
where
their
language
and
customs
of
life
and
dress
are
more
or
less
maintained
the
women
are
generally
of
better
physique
than
the
chinese
principally
on
account
of
the
fact
that
their
work
is
almost
exclusively
outdoor
but
as
they
begin
to
copy
the
chinese
and
live
a
more
sedentary
life
this
fine
physique
will
probably
gradually
disappear
a
good
many
already
bind
their
feet
when
i
came
out
in
the
early
morning
the
thermometer
was
twenty
degrees
below
zero
and
my
nose
was
red
and
without
feeling
aq
and
great
coat
were
required
but
i
was
totally
oblivious
of
the
stiff
climbing
awaiting
me
immediately
outside
the
town
to
reach
the
highest
point
in
which
bathed
me
in
perspiration
as
if
i
had
played
three
sets
of
tennis
in
the
tropics
mountains
were
wild
and
barren
with
nothing
in
them
to
enable
one
to
forget
in
natural
beauty
the
fatigues
of
a
toilsome
ascent
villages
came
now
and
again
in
sight
stretched
out
at
the
extremity
of
the
plain
before
my
eyes
with
their
white
gables
red
walls
and
black
tiled
roofs
but
during
the
day
we
passed
through
two
only
the
first
was
a
little
place
where
decay
would
have
been
absolute
had
it
not
been
for
the
likin
ar
flag
which
enables
squeezes
to
be
extorted
ruthlessly
from
the
muleteer
and
conveyed
to
the
pockets
of
the
prospering
customs
agent
it
boasted
only
ten
or
twelve
tumbling
tenements
where
my
sympathy
went
out
to
the
physical
wrecks
of
men
who
came
slowly
and
stared
long
and
wondered
at
the
commonest
article
of
my
meager
impedimenta
they
seemed
poorer
and
lower
down
the
human
scale
than
any
i
had
yet
seen
on
one
of
the
ragged
garments
worn
by
a
man
of
about
i
counted
no
less
than
patches
of
different
shapes
sizes
and
materials
hieroglyphically
and
skillessly
thrown
together
to
hide
his
back
but
still
his
brown
unwashed
flesh
was
visible
in
many
places
looking
upon
them
one
did
not
like
to
think
that
these
beings
were
men
men
with
passions
like
to
one
own
for
all
the
interests
real
and
imaginary
all
the
topics
which
should
expand
the
mind
of
man
and
connect
him
in
sympathy
with
general
existence
were
crushed
in
the
absorbing
considerations
of
how
rice
was
to
be
procured
for
their
families
of
diseaseful
brats
they
had
no
brains
these
men
or
if
heaven
had
thus
them
they
did
not
exercise
them
in
their
industry
their
coarse
rough
hands
alone
gained
food
for
the
feeding
and
these
dwellings
these
were
their
homes
to
me
worse
homes
than
none
at
all
in
their
architecture
not
even
a
single
idea
could
be
traced
the
chinese
here
had
proceeded
as
if
by
merest
accident
all
i
could
think
as
i
returned
their
wondering
glances
was
that
their
world
must
be
very
very
old
but
i
have
no
time
or
space
to
talk
of
them
here
to
throw
more
than
a
cursory
glance
at
them
would
lead
me
into
interminable
disquisitions
of
a
mythological
anthropological
craniological
and
antediluvian
nature
for
which
one
would
not
find
universal
approval
among
his
readers
to
those
who
would
study
such
questions
i
say
fall
to
there
is
enough
scope
for
a
lifetime
to
bring
into
light
the
primeval
element
so
strangely
woven
into
the
lives
of
these
people
at
bunting
and
weird
street
decoration
made
the
place
hideous
in
my
eyes
the
crowded
town
was
making
considerable
ado
about
some
expected
official
i
saw
none
more
than
a
courteous
youth
to
whom
of
course
i
was
quite
unknown
and
deaf
and
dumb
who
graciously
shifted
goods
and
chattels
from
the
inn
best
room
to
hand
it
over
to
me
for
my
occupation
with
due
tact
and
some
excitability
i
protested
vigorously
against
his
coming
out
he
insisted
smiling
upon
him
with
grave
benignity
i
said
that
i
would
take
a
smaller
room
and
gave
orders
to
that
effect
to
my
man
adding
that
my
whole
sense
of
right
and
justice
towards
revolted
against
such
on
his
part
he
still
insisted
smiling
again
this
time
the
timid
smile
of
the
commoner
looking
up
into
the
face
of
the
great
i
allowed
myself
reluctantly
to
be
pushed
bodily
into
the
best
apartment
this
was
my
intention
from
the
first
although
not
too
familiar
with
it
i
allowed
the
chinese
to
imagine
that
i
was
well
grounded
in
the
absurdities
of
his
national
etiquette
whilst
he
observing
too
the
outrageous
routine
of
common
politeness
probably
went
away
swearing
that
he
had
been
turned
out
he
had
cut
off
his
nose
to
spite
his
face
i
can
not
truthfully
deny
however
that
the
fellow
was
very
kind
but
he
would
persist
in
the
belief
that
it
was
an
impossibility
for
me
to
tell
the
truth
later
pointing
at
me
and
eyeing
me
up
and
down
as
i
shaved
in
the
twilight
he
sneered
engleeshman
engleeshman
and
scooting
with
an
armful
of
clothing
small
pots
of
eatables
official
documents
and
other
sundries
told
me
that
he
did
not
believe
that
such
a
noble
person
could
not
speak
such
a
contemptible
language
as
chinese
seeing
no
official
then
i
presumed
i
was
their
man
whilst
i
fed
slowly
on
my
rice
and
cabbage
in
a
small
room
with
my
nose
as
near
as
convenient
to
my
oil
lamp
to
get
a
little
warmth
the
discomfort
of
chinese
life
was
forced
upon
me
and
i
imagined
i
was
having
a
good
time
i
was
the
best
off
in
the
inn
by
far
the
others
must
have
been
colder
certainly
had
worse
food
to
eat
and
yet
to
me
it
was
all
the
height
of
utmost
cheerlessness
from
a
hamlet
opposite
the
town
where
i
sat
down
by
the
fire
exhausted
in
an
old
woman
shaky
dwelling
and
fed
on
aged
sardines
and
hot
rice
atrocious
mixture
there
is
a
plain
extending
for
twenty
li
to
flat
as
country
in
the
fen
district
the
road
was
good
in
wet
weather
however
it
must
be
terrible
and
i
would
drive
a
across
were
it
not
for
the
ruts
which
disfigure
the
surface
and
i
know
a
man
who
would
do
this
even
despite
the
ruts
he
takes
a
delight
in
running
over
dogs
and
small
boys
damaging
rickshaws
bumping
into
and
so
on
he
would
have
done
it
with
liveliest
freedom
but
what
poverty
there
was
what
women
what
children
with
barely
an
exception
the
women
had
faces
ground
by
want
and
bare
necessity
in
which
every
cheerful
and
sympathetic
lineament
had
been
effaced
by
slavery
and
misery
in
the
bitter
cold
they
women
and
children
crouched
round
a
scanty
firing
not
enough
even
to
keep
alive
their
natural
heat
one
long
pitiful
sight
of
thriftless
poverty
to
hungay
was
a
fearful
day
little
to
eat
could
i
procure
and
the
cold
gave
me
a
lusty
ox
appetite
to
me
a
bellyful
came
as
a
windfall
at
last
we
sat
down
by
the
roadside
at
one
small
table
hearing
the
test
of
age
rickety
and
we
gathered
like
hogs
at
their
troughs
with
the
household
hog
scratching
at
our
feet
i
grew
impatient
and
querulous
over
constant
culinary
disappointment
i
longed
not
for
the
board
of
the
pampered
and
luxurious
i
wanted
food
indigent
man
was
i
whose
dietetical
elegancies
had
been
forgotten
a
man
with
ravenous
desires
seeking
sustenance
not
relishes
the
means
of
life
not
the
means
of
pampering
the
carcass
i
wanted
food
and
here
i
had
it
the
hungry
were
to
be
fed
it
was
a
foul
orgy
a
gruesome
spectacle
a
horrible
picture
of
the
gluttony
of
famished
men
this
meal
conjured
up
visions
of
the
most
unlovely
of
the
functions
we
fed
on
that
long
greasy
grimy
slippery
slimy
string
of
boneless
white
i
see
it
now
and
the
tin
of
sardines
set
before
me
too
the
broken
stools
in
the
shed
the
dismantled
hearth
the
muddy
earthen
floor
the
haggard
hungry
villains
i
see
them
all
again
as
it
should
however
be
said
that
i
went
away
from
the
main
road
over
a
range
of
hills
where
nobody
lives
had
i
kept
to
the
ta
lu
food
would
have
been
quite
easy
to
get
to
hungay
was
given
the
honor
of
entertaining
me
over
the
sunday
a
pleasant
rest
after
a
week
of
arduous
and
exhausting
walking
i
arrived
late
at
night
and
the
old
town
rough
streets
were
bathed
in
a
silver
shower
of
moonbeams
the
air
was
cold
and
frosty
little
groups
of
the
curious
came
to
the
doors
of
their
dwellings
laughing
sarcastically
despite
their
own
poverty
at
the
distinguished
traveler
thus
coming
upon
them
in
marked
contrast
to
this
outside
animation
were
the
happenings
at
the
inn
which
gave
me
shelter
business
was
bad
three
undistinguished
travelers
coolies
with
loads
and
myself
and
men
made
up
the
meager
total
of
paying
guests
this
was
the
reason
why
it
was
chosen
for
me
for
peace
and
quiet
quiet
had
been
forced
upon
the
household
so
i
was
told
by
the
death
by
fits
of
a
haughty
and
resolute
lady
and
now
that
the
night
had
fallen
and
we
had
all
had
our
rice
the
deep
hush
or
its
equivalent
in
cathay
at
all
events
seemed
likely
to
be
unbroken
until
a
new
day
should
dawn
my
room
here
had
a
verandah
overlooking
a
back
court
and
here
i
sat
at
midnight
unseen
by
anyone
looking
up
to
the
changeless
stars
in
an
unpitying
sky
and
as
i
stood
thus
there
blew
from
the
gates
of
night
and
across
the
mountains
a
wind
that
made
me
shiver
less
with
physical
cold
than
with
a
sense
of
loneliness
and
captivity
for
on
to
my
verandah
came
four
soldiers
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
hour
of
death
drew
nigh
and
as
i
looked
again
first
upon
the
cloudswept
sky
and
upon
the
cold
and
steely
glitter
of
the
stars
and
then
again
at
the
soldiers
with
their
guns
i
turned
giddy
shuddering
at
the
darkness
and
the
loneliness
and
with
a
nameless
fear
lying
at
the
center
of
life
like
a
lurking
shadow
of
an
unknown
unseen
foe
they
addressed
me
but
i
cared
not
what
they
said
i
pretended
i
could
not
speak
chinese
watched
the
quartet
form
a
circle
and
talk
slowly
and
low
and
it
did
not
need
the
mind
of
a
prophet
to
see
that
they
were
discussing
how
best
they
could
capture
me
were
they
going
to
kill
me
my
boy
and
the
other
friends
i
had
in
the
place
were
sleeping
blissfully
ignorant
that
their
master
was
in
such
trying
straits
i
was
asked
my
name
and
the
inquirers
not
over
civil
were
told
they
again
asked
me
for
something
i
knew
not
what
probably
for
my
passport
i
had
none
and
cursed
my
luck
that
i
had
forgotten
to
pack
it
when
i
had
left
to
me
it
was
quite
evident
that
they
were
deciding
my
destiny
or
so
it
seemed
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
looking
upwards
i
wondered
whether
i
was
soon
to
learn
the
secret
of
the
stars
and
sky
and
those
men
seemed
to
watch
the
secret
workings
of
my
soul
outside
the
wind
made
moan
continuously
suddenly
my
door
opened
noisily
a
light
was
flashed
upon
us
and
i
saw
the
bulky
form
of
the
landlord
then
all
was
well
soon
one
of
my
men
appeared
and
explained
that
the
soldiers
were
on
their
way
to
meet
an
official
who
was
coming
from
that
their
instructions
were
that
they
would
meet
him
at
hungay
they
took
me
for
the
gwan
so
my
end
was
not
yet
but
now
months
afterwards
when
i
stand
and
listen
to
the
wind
at
midnight
there
seems
borne
to
me
in
every
sob
and
wail
a
memory
of
that
hateful
night
and
the
four
soldiers
with
their
guns
it
seemed
not
long
afterwards
that
i
was
awakened
by
noises
on
the
doorstep
looking
out
i
found
a
bullock
its
four
feet
tied
together
with
a
straw
rope
writhing
in
its
last
agonies
the
butcher
in
his
hand
a
cruel
bladed
knife
still
red
with
blood
smiling
the
smile
of
ironic
torture
as
he
looked
down
upon
his
struggling
victim
he
straightway
skinned
the
animal
and
cut
up
the
carcass
immediately
in
front
of
my
door
where
lao
chang
waited
to
get
the
best
cut
for
my
dinner
my
three
squatted
alongside
going
through
their
apologetic
ablutions
as
if
naught
were
happening
their
dirty
were
wrung
and
rewrung
they
got
to
work
with
that
universal
the
forefinger
and
that
the
dead
body
of
a
bullock
was
being
dissected
two
feet
from
the
table
at
which
they
ate
their
steaming
rice
was
a
detail
of
not
the
slightest
consequence
in
the
world
hungay
is
an
capital
of
one
of
the
original
kingdoms
destroyed
in
the
year
the
road
leading
out
towards
was
built
some
considerable
time
before
that
year
and
has
never
been
subject
to
any
repairs
whatever
for
this
fact
i
have
drawn
upon
my
imagination
but
should
be
very
much
surprised
to
know
that
i
am
far
out
in
my
reckoning
villagers
have
appropriated
the
public
slabs
and
small
boulders
which
comprised
the
wretched
thoroughfare
reminiscent
puddles
tell
you
the
tale
and
the
badness
of
the
road
renders
it
necessary
for
the
traveler
to
be
out
of
bed
a
little
earlier
than
usual
to
face
the
ordeal
the
road
has
been
practically
as
bad
as
walking
along
the
sides
of
the
yangtze
but
as
i
studied
the
patience
and
physical
vitality
of
my
three
men
laughing
and
joking
with
the
of
children
with
nearly
seventy
catties
dangling
from
their
without
a
word
of
murmuring
i
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
myself
that
i
whose
duty
it
was
merely
to
should
have
made
such
a
fuss
these
men
were
prepared
to
work
a
very
long
time
for
very
little
reward
as
no
matter
how
small
the
rewards
for
the
terribly
exhausting
labor
it
were
better
than
none
at
all
so
they
philosophized
that
quiet
persistence
and
unfailing
patience
form
a
national
virtue
among
the
chinese
the
capacity
to
wait
without
complaint
and
to
bear
all
with
silent
endurance
this
virtue
is
seen
more
clearly
in
great
national
disasters
which
occasionally
befall
the
country
the
terrible
famine
of
was
the
cause
of
the
death
of
millions
of
people
and
left
scores
of
millions
without
house
food
or
clothing
they
were
driven
forth
as
wanderers
on
the
face
of
the
earth
without
home
without
hope
the
government
does
nothing
whatever
in
these
cases
the
people
who
wish
to
live
must
find
the
means
to
live
and
what
impressed
me
all
through
my
wanderings
was
the
absolute
science
to
which
poverty
is
reduced
in
such
calamities
the
chinese
of
all
men
on
the
surface
will
battle
along
if
there
is
any
chance
at
all
if
he
is
blessed
he
once
more
becomes
a
farmer
but
if
not
he
accepts
the
position
as
inevitable
and
irremediable
the
chinese
race
has
the
finest
power
in
the
world
to
withstand
with
fortitude
the
ills
of
life
and
the
miseries
which
follow
inability
to
procure
the
wherewithal
to
live
their
nerves
are
somehow
different
from
our
western
nerves
in
china
nothing
is
wasted
not
only
in
food
but
in
everything
affecting
the
common
life
that
a
beast
dies
of
disease
is
of
no
concern
it
is
eaten
all
the
same
from
head
to
hoof
from
skin
to
entrail
and
the
remarkable
fact
is
that
they
do
not
seem
to
suffer
from
it
either
at
mentioned
in
a
previous
chapter
i
saw
a
horse
being
pushed
down
the
hillside
to
the
river
it
was
not
yet
dead
but
was
dying
so
far
as
i
could
see
of
inflammation
of
the
bowels
its
body
was
cut
up
and
there
were
several
people
waiting
to
buy
it
at
forty
cash
the
catty
from
hungay
onwards
i
met
a
class
of
people
i
had
not
seen
before
they
were
the
minchia
major
davies
whose
treatise
on
the
tribes
of
at
the
end
of
his
excellent
work
on
travel
in
the
province
is
probably
the
best
yet
written
writes
that
he
met
minchia
people
only
on
the
plains
of
and
and
never
east
of
the
latter
place
this
was
in
travel
some
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
and
the
fact
that
there
are
now
many
minchia
families
living
in
hungay
is
a
testimony
to
their
enterprise
as
a
tribe
in
going
farther
afield
in
search
of
the
means
to
live
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
minchia
originally
came
from
country
lying
between
the
border
of
the
province
and
round
and
the
plain
and
lake
most

suggested
the

as

all
was
ancient
and

yet
simple
and
glorious
and
as
one
of
my
followers
called
my
attention
to
the
telegraph

i
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
this
alone
stood
as
the
solitary
element
of
what
we
in
the
west
call
civilization
yet
nothing
bore
traces
of
gross
uncivilization
the
people
hard
workers
albeit
were
happy
and
quite
content
with
their
caravan
which
we
would
if
we
could
soon
displace
for
the

with

quite
content
if
but
a
couple
of
meals
each
day
were
earned
and
eaten
the
official
the
ruler
of
these
peaceful
people
passed
with
pomp
not
in
a
modern
carriage
not
in
a
modern
saloon
but
in
the
same
way
as
did
his
ancestors
back
in
the
dim
ages
in
a
carried
by
men
there
was
plenty
of
everything
enough
for
all
but
all
had
to
contribute
to
its
getting
there
was
no
greed
their
few
wants
were
easily
satisfied
and
here
as
everywhere
in
my
journeyings
i
have
noticed
it
to
be
the
case
among
the
common
people
there
was
no
desire
to
get
rich
and
absorb
wealth
they
wanted
to
live
to
learn
to
labor
as
little
as
the
growth
of
food
supplies
demanded
to
become
fathers
and
mothers
and
to
their
minds
to
get
the
most
out
of
life
and
who
will
contradict
it
they
do
not
see
with
the
eyes
of
the
west
we
do
not
we
can
not
see
with
their
eyes
but
surely
the
living
of
this
simple
life
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
has
a
good
deal
in
it
it
is
not
uncivilization
not
barbarism
and
the
traveler
in
china
can
come
to
but
one
opinion
even
in
the
midst
of
all
the
conflicting
emotions
which
result
from
his
own
upbringing
that
we
could
if
we
would
learn
many
a
good
lesson
from
the
life
of
the
celestial
in
his
own
country
yet
these
are
the
very
people
who
may
jostle
us
harshly
later
on
in
the
racial
struggle
i
am
not
suggesting
that
when
the
chinese
adopts
the
cult
of
the
west
and
comes
into
general
contact
with
it
and
i
believe
that
i
am
right
in
saying
that
this
is
the
desire
generally
speaking
of
the
whole
of
the
enlightened
classes
he
continues
with
his
few
wants
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
does
not
he
is
as
extravagant
and
perhaps
more
so
than
the
most
of
us
i
have
seen
straits
chinese
waste
at
the
gaming
tables
in
their
gorgeous
clubs
as
much
in
one
night
as
some
european
residents
handle
in
one
year
and
he
is
quick
to
get
his
his
horses
and
carriages
and
endless
other
ornaments
of
wealth
so
that
if
progress
in
the
course
of
the
evolution
of
nations
means
that
the
chinese
too
will
demand
all
that
the
european
now
demands
and
will
cease
to
find
satisfaction
in
the
existing
conditions
of
his
life
in
the
new
goal
towards
which
he
is
moving
and
if
he
in
course
of
time
should
increase
the
cost
of
living
per
head
to
equal
that
of
the
westerner
then
he
will
lose
a
good
deal
of
the
advantage
he
now
undoubtedly
has
in
the
struggle
for
racial
supremacy
but
if
gradually
taking
advantage
of
all
in
religion
in
science
in
literature
in
art
in
modern
naval
and
military
equipment
and
skill
and
all
that
has
made
nations
great
and
made
for
real
progress
in
the
west
he
were
also
to
continue
his
present
hardy
frugality
in
living
which
is
not
a
tenth
as
costly
in
proportion
to
that
of
the
occident
then
his
advantage
in
entering
upon
the
conflict
among
the
nations
for
ultimate
supremacy
would
be
undoubted
immeasurable
the
question
is
will
he
if
he
will
then
the
occident
has
much
to
fear
china
going
ahead
throughout
the
empire
as
she
is
at
the
present
moment
in
certain
parts
will
in
course
of
time
as
is
only
fair
and
natural
to
expect
have
an
army
greater
in
numbers
than
is
possible
to
any
european
power
and
her
will
be
lower
per
head
per
fighting
man
subsequently
granting
that
china
fulfils
our
fears
and
becomes
as
great
a
fighting
power
as
military
experts
declare
she
will
even
in
our
generation
by
virtue
of
her
numbers
alone
apart
from
phenomenal
powers
of
endurance
which
as
every
writer
on
china
and
her
people
is
agreed
is
excelled
by
no
other
race
on
earth
she
would
be
able
to
dictate
terms
to
the
west
but
again
will
she
will
the
people
continue
to
live
as
they
are
living
i
personally
believe
that
the
chinese
will
not
i
believe
that
as
the
nation
progresses
more
in
accordance
with
lines
of
progress
laid
down
by
the
west
so
will
her
wants
increase
and
consequent
expenses
of
life
become
greater
the
even
are
beginning
to
acknowledge
that
they
have
no
ordinary
comforts
in
other
parts
of
the
empire
the
people
are
already
beginning
to
learn
what
comfort
sanitation
lighting
and
general
organization
means
in
the
home
in
the
city
in
the
country
in
the
nation
and
they
are
learning
too
that
it
all
costs
money
and
means
perhaps
a
higher
state
of
social
life
for
this
they
do
not
mind
the
money
they
are
not
going
they
are
going
to
be
and
when
in
the
future
near
or
far
we
shall
find
them
as
is
almost
inevitable
able
to
compete
in
everything
with
other
nations
we
shall
find
that
they
have
not
been
successful
in
learning
the
source
of
strength
without
having
absorbed
also
some
of
the
weaknesses
they
will
not
escape
the
vices
even
if
they
learn

virtues

at

he

and
the
this
morning
from
the
foot
of
a
high
spur
i
saw
a
couple
of
gawky
fellows
shambling
along
in
an
imitation
european
dress
and
i
pricked
up
my
ears
it
seemed
as
if
europeans
were
about
one
of
the
fellows
had
on
a
pair
of
khaki
trousers
ludicrously
patched
with
chinese
blue
a
tweed
coat
of
london
cut
also
patched
with
chinese
blue
and
a
battered
elswood
topee
i
saw
this
through
my
soon
after
coming
out
from
a
cup
in
the
winding
pathway
emerged
a
chair
and
i
had
no
doubt
then
that
it
was
a
european
on
the
road
and
i
began
to
get
as
curious
as
anyone
naturally
would
in
a
country
where
in
interior
travel
his
own
foreign
kind
are
met
with
but
seldom
hurrying
on
i
managed
to
pass
the
chair
in
a
place
where
overhanging
foliage
shut
out
the
light
so
that
i
could
not
see
through
the
windows
and
as
the
front
curtain
was
down
i
concluded
that
it
must
be
a
lady
probably
a
missionary
lady
i
pushed
on
to
the
nearest
tavern
a
tea
tavern
of
course
buttoned
up
my
coat
so
that
she
should
not
see
my
dirty
shirt
and
waited
for
the
presence
to
approach
from
an
inner
apartment
through
a
window
i
could
see
all
that
went
on
outside
but
could
not
be
seen
what
is
it
that
makes
a
man
heart
go
when
he
is
about
to
meet
a
european
lady
in
presently
the
chair
approached
from
it
came
a
person
covered
in
a
huge
coat
many
sizes
too
large
for
his
small
body
it
was
a
chinese
several
men
were
pushed
out
of
his
way
as
he
strode
towards
me
extending
his
hand
in
a
cordial
shake
old
fellow
style
and
yelling
in
purest
accent
good
morning
sir
morning
sir
oh
good
morning
you
speak
english
well
i
congratulate
you
have
you
had
a
good
journey
how
far
are
you
going
very
warm
i
waited
it
is
so
interesting
when
one
meets
a
gentleman
who
can
speak
english
it
is
a
pleasant
change
i
waited
again
will
you
good
morning
morning
morn
he
he
he
but
pardon
me
will
morning
morning
he
yes
you
silly
ass
i
know
it
is
morning
but
yes
yes
morning
morning
he
then
made
for
the
door
not
the
least
abashed
later
he
came
back
and
invited
me
to
speak
chinese
probably
thinking
that
i
was
wondering
why
he
had
made
such
an
absolute
fool
of
himself
i
learned
that
this
august
gentleman
possessed
a
name
in
happy
correspondence
with
a
fowl
chi
he
pointed
contemptuously
to
a
member
of
that
feather
tribe
as
he
told
me
whether
he
could
speak
chinese
when
he
was
or
was
not
at
or
whether
he
had
a
son
whose
knowledge
of
my
language
was
vast
and
who
was
at
that
moment
at
i
could
not
quite
fathom
and
he
could
not
explain
he
had
a
look
at
my
caravan
generally
and
then
turned
his
scrutiny
upon
my
common
tweeds
informing
me
that
the
quality
bore
no
comparison
with
his
own
he
could
travel
in
a
chair
i
had
to
it
was
all
very
pub
hao
after
some
time
he
cleared
out
with
much
empty
swagger
and
i
followed
leisurely
on
behind
feeling
yes
why
not
publish
it
pleased
that
this
bolt
from
the
blue
had
not
been
a
lady
this
young
fellow
a
mere
slip
of
a
boy
wore
every
indication
of
perfect
borne
out
in
a
multitude
of
ways
common
to
his
class
he
i
presumed
was
one
of
the
fledglings
who
undertake
responsibilities
far
beyond
them
or
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
he
had
been
one
of
the
army
of
young
men
who
having
the
merest
smattering
of
english
wholly
unable
to
converse
set
up
as
teachers
of
english
i
have
found
this
quite
common
among
the
rising
classes
in
the
cool
assumption
of
unblushing
superiority
evinced
in
discussing
intellectual
and
philosophic
problems
is
remarkable
the
chinese
in
the
area
i
speak
of
are
little
people
with
little
brain
this
was
a
specimen
yet
to
be
fair
in
china
the
work
of
reform
is
mainly
the
work
of
young
men
who
although
but
only
partly
equipped
for
their
work
approach
it
with
perfect
confidence
and
considerable
energy
not
knowing
sufficient
to
realize
the
difficulties
they
are
undertaking
in
japan
the
same
thing
was
done
the
young
men
there
undertook
to
dispute
and
doubt
everything
which
came
in
the
way
of
national
reorganization
setting
aside
as
china
must
do
if
she
is
to
take
her
place
alongside
the
ideal
she
has
set
up
for
herself
japan
parental
teaching
ancestral
authority
the
customs
of
centuries
a
large
proportion
of
the
population
of
china
has
a
passion
for
reform
and
progress
this
young
fellow
was
a
typical
example
in
the
west
of
china
however
to
conform
with
the
spirit
of
reform
and
real
progress
not
the
which
is
satisfying
them
at
the
present
moment
they
must
needs
change
their
ways
seventeen
memorial
plates
were
passed
at
the
entrance
to
a
particularly
place
as
one
approaches
it
from
the
hill
a
remarkably
ungainly
individual
with
a
hole
in
the
top
of
his
skull
and
his
body
one
mass
of
sores
came
to
me
here
addressed
me
as
sien
seng
and
then
commenced
an
oration
to
the
effect
that
he
was
a
that
he
had
known
the
missionaries
down
by
the
yangtze
and
that
he
knew
he
would
be
welcome
to
accompany
me
to
hsiakwan
at
he
switched
himself
on
the
main
line
of
my
caravan
here
was
a
man
who
had
been
brought
in
contact
with
the
missionary
away
down
in
another
province
and
he
knew
he
was
welcome
i
liked
that
in
all
my
journeyings
in
i
was
increasingly
impressed
with
the
value
of
the
missionary
that
man
who
of
all
men
in
the
far
east
is
the
most
subject
to
malicious
criticism
and
generally
be
it
said
from
those
persons
who
know
little
or
nothing
about
his
work
you
can
not
measure
the
missionary
work
by
conversions
by
mere
statistics
i
venture
to
assert
that
it
is
through
the
missionary
that
the
west
applied
pressure
and
supplied
china
with
political
ideas
and
put
within
her
reach
the
material
and
instruments
which
would
enable
her
to
carry
such
ideas
into
practice
this
apart
from
religious
teaching
more
particularly
is
this
the
case
in
respect
to
popular
education
perhaps
by
means
of
which
the
transformation
of
old
china
into
new
china
will
be
a
less
long
and
difficult
process
the
people
may
not
want
the
missionary
i
do
not
for
a
moment
say
that
they
do
but
they
need
to
know
the
secret
of
his
power
and
the
power
of
his
kind
and
they
must
study
his
language
his
science
his
machinery
his
steamboats
his
army
his
they
realize
that
the
foreigner
is
useful
not
for
what
he
can
do
but
for
what
he
can
teach
therefore
they
tolerate
the
missionary
this
is
virtually
the
national
policy
of
china
towards
foreigners
a
policy
gaining
the
acceptance
of
the
people
with
remarkable
quickness
after
having
set
aside
all
considerations
of
national
prejudice
and
patriotism
it
is
interesting
to
ask
whether
it
is
actually
a
fact
that
the
chinese
as
a
race
are
inferior
to
the
peoples
of
the
west
much
has
been
said
on
the
subject
i
give
my
opinion
flatly
that
the
chinese
is
inferior
and
the
longer
i
live
with
him
the
more
numerous
become
the
lessons
which
he
teaches
me
the
question
when
we
examine
it
closely
has
really
very
little
to
do
with
political
strength
or
military
efficiency
or
benjamin
kidd
relative
standards
of
living
or
even
the
usual
material
accompaniments
of
what
we
call
an
advanced
civilization
it
is
a
question
for
the
trained
anthropologist
and
the
craniologist
rather
than
for
the
casual
observer
of
men
and
manners
the
japanese
people
are
now
much
more
highly
civilized
according
to
western
notions
than
they
were
half
a
century
ago
but
it
would
be
ludicrously
erroneous
to
say
that
they
are
now
a
higher
race
from
the
evolutionary
point
of
view
than
they
were
then
evolution
does
not
work
quite
so
rapidly
as
that
even
in
these
days
of
the
japanese
have
advanced
not
because
their
brains
have
suddenly
become
larger
or
their
moral
and
intellectual
capabilities
have
all
at
once
made
a
leap
forward
but
because
their
intercourse
with
western
nations
after
centuries
of
isolated
seclusion
showed
them
that
certain
characteristic
features
of
european
civilization
would
be
of
great
use
in
strengthening
and
enriching
their
own
country
developing
its
resources
and
giving
it
the
power
to
resist
aggression
if
the
japanese
were
as
members
of
the
inferior
to
us
fifty
years
ago
they
are
inferior
to
us
now
if
they
are
our
equals
and
the
burden
of
proof
certainly
now
rests
on
him
who
wishes
to
show
that
they
are
not
our
knowledge
of
the
origin
and
history
of
eastern
peoples
scanty
though
it
is
should
certainly
tend
to
assure
us
that
the
chinese
are
our
equals
too
there
is
no
valid
reason
for
supposing
that
the
chinese
people
are
ethnically
inferior
to
the
japanese
they
have
preserved
their
isolated
seclusion
longer
than
the
japanese
because
until
very
recently
it
was
less
urgently
necessary
for
them
to
come
out
of
it
they
have
taken
a
longer
time
to
appreciate
the
value
of
western
science
and
certain
features
of
western
civilization
because
new
ideas
take
longer
to
permeate
a
very
large
country
than
a
small
one
and
because
china
was
rich
within
her
own
borders
of
all
the
necessaries
of
life
au
and
the
west
too
must
learn
that
the
peace
of
europe
depends
upon
the
integrity
of
china
for
the
time
is
coming
not
in
the
lives
of
any
who
read
these
lines
but
coming
inevitably
when
china
will
by
her
might
by
her
immense
numbers
of
trained
men
by
her
developed
naval
and
military
strength
be
able
to
say
to
the
nations
of
the
earth
there
must
be
no
more
war
and
she
will
be
strong
enough
to
be
able
to
enforce
it
as
with
individuals
so
with
nations
and
a
people
who
are
marked
by
such
rare
physical
vitality
such
remarkable
powers
of
endurance
against
great
odds
are
surely
designed
for
some
nobler
purpose
than
merely
to
bear
with
fortitude
the
ills
of
life
and
the
misery
of
starvation
it
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
criticise
the
west
criticises
the
chinese
because
he
is
a
heathen
because
they
do
not
understand
him
hundreds
of
millions
of
the
chinese
race
hate
and
fear
the
man
of
the
west
for
exactly
the
same
reason
as
would
cause
us
to
hate
the
chinese
were
the
situation
reversed
i
do
not
need
to
go
into
history
from
the
days
when
the
chinese
first
began
to
show
their
suspicion
contempt
and
fear
of
foreigners
and
their
interpretation
of
the
motives
and
purposes
which
took
them
to
the
celestial
empire
it
would
take
too
much
space
but
if
we
of
the
west
did
our
part
as
we
rub
up
against
the
chinese
everywhere
in
charitably
taking
him
at
his
best
things
would
alter
much
more
speedily
that
they
are
doing
because
the
chinese
bristles
with
contradictions
and
seemingly
unanswerable
conundrums
we
immediately
dub
him
a
barbarian
do
not
endeavor
to
understand
him
do
not
understand
enough
of
his
language
to
listen
to
him
and
learn
his
point
of
view
however
it
is
all
slowly
passing
so
very
slowly
too
but
still
china
is
progressing
and
now
this
oldest
man
in
the
world
is
becoming
again
the
youngest
but
has
all
the
accumulations
and
advantages
of
age
in
all
countries
to
lean
upon
and
learn
from
gave
me
a
very
decent
inn
the
top
room
in
front
of
which
was
provided
with
a
courtyard
with
every
convenience
for
the
traveler
that
is
for
china
the
inn
cook
and
was
out
playing
on
the
street
when
we
put
in
an
early
appearance
my
men
lost
their
temper
ground
their
teeth
foamed
at
the
mouth
and
got
desperate
the
only
man
on
the
premises
was
a
poor
old
fellow
who
foolishly
bumped
his
uncovered
head
on
the
ground
on
which
i
stood
as
an
act
of
great
servility
and
a
secret
sign
that
i
should
throw
him
a
few
cash
and
then
resumed
his
occupation
in
the
sun
of
wiping
his
already
inflamed
eyes
with
the
one
unwashed
garment
which
covered
him
i
pitied
him
he
knew
it
and
traded
upon
my
pity
until
i
invoked
a
few
choice
words
from
lao
chang
to
fall
upon
him
when
the
cook
did
put
in
an
appearance
he
and
everybody
dead
and
living
placed
anywhere
near
his
genealogical
tree
underwent
a
rough
quarter
of
an
hour
from
the
anathematical
tongues
of
my
companions
the
old
man
by
virtue
of
the
growth
on
my
chin
this
epithet
of
respect
was
commonly
used
towards
me
wanted
to
wash
his
face
and
drink
his
tea
he
was
tired
with
walking
he
was
a
foreign
mandarin
did
the
blank
blank
blank
cook
the
worm
and
no
man
not
know
that
a
foreigner
was
among
them
and
then
they
fell
to
piling
up
the
ignominy
again
and
placing
to
the
dishonor
various
degrees
of
lowliest
origin
common
among
the
chinese
proletariat
which
thank
heaven
i
did
not
quite
understand
that
evening
all
came
to
honor
me
in
my
room
and
to
admire
and
ask
to
be
given
all
i
had
in
my
boxes
that
it
was
all
a
huge
revelation
to
many
who
came
and
inquired
who
i
might
be
and
whence
i
might
have
come
was
quite
evident
one
fellow
dressed
gaudily
in
expensive
silks
and
satins
probably
borrowed
came
with
pomp
and
pride
and
disappointment
was
writ
large
upon
his
ugly
face
when
he
learned
that
i
could
not
or
would
not
speak
with
him
he
mentioned
that
he
was
one
of
the
cultured
of
the
city
but
the
chinese
are
all
more
or
less
cultured
my
own
coolies
although
not
knowing
a
character
are
really
cultured
they
are
the
most
polite
men
i
have
ever
traveled
with
the
culture
at
any
rate
although
more
apparent
than
real
has
a
universality
in
china
which
the
foreigner
must
observe
in
moving
among
the
people
and
which
as
a
sort
of
lubrication
makes
the
wheels
of
society
run
smoother
this
man
was
not
cultured
in
the
matter
of
taste
in
the
choice
of
colors
he
was
altogether
frightfully
lacking
in
sense
of
harmony
and
when
one
saw
the
little
boy
who
trotted
along
with
him
one
might
have
thought
that
joseph
coat
had
been
revived
for
my
especial
edification
he
was
a
peculiar
being
this
man
he
would
persist
in
sitting
down
on
his
haunches
despite
frequent
invitations
to
use
a
chair
how
is
it
all
orientals
can
do
this
and
not
one
european
out
of
fifty
lao
chang
afterwards
informed
me
that
this
man
wife
had
just
presented
him
with
a
second
son
and
great
jubilation
was
taking
place
the
birth
of
a
child
especially
of
a
boy
is
a
great
event
in
any
chinese
household
and
considerable
anxiety
is
felt
lest
demons
should
be
lurking
about
the
house
and
cause
trouble
a
sorcerer
is
called
in
just
before
the
birth
to
exorcise
all
evil
influences
from
the
house
and
secure
peace
this
is
the
exorcism
of
great
peace
simultaneously
comes
the
midwife
should
the
birth
be
attended
with
great
pain
and
difficulty
recourse
is
had
to
crackers
the
firing
of
guns
or
whatever
similar
device
can
be
thought
of
to
scare
off
the
demons
solicitude
is
often
felt
that
the
first
visit
to
the
house
after
the
birth
of
the
child
should
be
made
by
a
lucky
person
for
the
child
whole
future
career
may
be
blighted
by
meeting
with
an
person
no
outsider
will
enter
the
room
where
the
birth
took
place
for
forty
days
on
the
anniversary
of
a
boy
birth
the
relatives
and
friends
bring
presents
of
clothes
hats
ornaments
playthings
and
red
eggs
the
baby
is
placed
on
the
floor
the
earth
which
is
the
first
place
he
touches
he
is
born
into
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
around
him
are
placed
various
articles
such
as
a
book
pencil
chopsticks
money
and
so
on
he
will
follow
the
profession
which
has
to
do
with
the
articles
he
first
touches
av
this
was
the
fortieth
day
and
so
my
visitant
honored
me
by
thrusting
his
contemptible
presence
upon
me
and
he
would
not
go
until
late
at
night
when
a
man
with
a
diseased
hip
and
one
eye
and
a
ghastly
thing
at
that
called
to
see
whether
i
could
treat
him
with
medicine
hsiakwan
in
days
to
come
will
probably
have
a
big
industry
in
brick
and
tile
making
fifteen
li
from
the
town
on
the
side
many
people
now
get
their
living
at
the
business
and
one
could
easily
dream
of
a
hsiakwan
brick
and
tile
company
limited
with
the
children
of
the
present
pioneers
running
for
the
morning
papers
to
have
a
look
at
the
share
market
reports
with
light
railways
connected
up
with
the
main
line
which
has
not
yet
been
built
and
so
on
and
so
on
hsiakwan
is
perhaps
the
busiest
town
on
the
main
trade
route
from
to
burma
although
growing
is
only
the
official
town
of
which
hsiakwan
is
the
commercial
entrepôt
it
was
here
that
i
stayed
one
sunday
some
time
after
this
at
one
of
the
biggest
inns
i
have
ever
been
into
in
china
it
had
no
less
than
four
buildings
each
with
a
paved
rectangular
courtyard
which
all
the
rooms
overlooked
a
military
official
who
was
on
his
way
to
to
deal
with
the
rebellion
of
which
the
reader
has
already
learnt
a
good
deal
was
expected
soon
after
i
arrived
my
room
was
already
arranged
however
when
the
landlord
came
to
me
and
said
yang
gwan
you
must
please
go
out
now
the
yang
gwan
as
was
expected
stayed
where
he
was
smiled
in
magnanimous
acquiescence
invited
the
proprietor
a
stout
jolly
person
with
one
eye
to
be
seated
and
remained
quiet
again
and
again
was
i
told
that
i
should
be
required
to
clear
out
and
give
up
the
best
room
to
the
official
and
his
but
unfortunately
the
inquirer
did
not
improve
the
situation
by
persisting
in
the
foolish
belief
that
the
foreigner
was
hard
of
hearing
he
shouted
his
request
into
my
ear
in
a
stentorian
basso
he
waved
his
hands
he
pointed
he
made
signs
the
chinese
langage
and
manner
however
are
difficult
to
an
foreigner
i
poor
foolish
fellow
endeavoring
to
treat
the
chinese
in
a
manner
identical
to
that
which
he
would
have
employed
had
conditions
been
reversed
stared
vacantly
and
woodenly
into
a
seemingly
bewildering
infinite
and
timidly
remarked
o
puh
lai
knowing
then
that
my
hearing
had
not
come
he
requisitioned
my
boy
for
the
by
this
time
was
glumly
peering
into
my
doorway
but
to
his
disgust
lao
chang
also
was
equally
unsuccessful
in
making
me
tumble
to
their
meaning
the
best
room
therefore
continued
to
be
mine
soon
after
the
official
came
and
my
dog
began
by
mauling
his
canine
guardian
tearing
away
half
his
ear
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
one
of
my
horses
got
loose
and
had
a
fight
with
a
mule
attached
to
the
official
party
laming
him
seriously
and
as
the
foreigner
emerged
in
his
night
attire
to
prevent
further
damage
he
encountered
the
mandarin
himself
and
pinned
him
dead
against
the
wall
in
the
dark
after
having
stepped
on
his
corn
my
pony
had
pulled
several
morsels
of
flesh
from
the
mule
carcase
the
yang
gwan
certainly
came
off
best
and
the
following
morning
as
the
chinese
gwan
with
his
retinue
of
six
chairs
and
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
departed
the
yang
gwan
smiled
a
happy
farewell
which
was
not
effusively
reciprocated
as
i
came
out
of
the
inn
i
met
a
buddhist
priest
worn
with
general
dilapidation
and
old
age
with
a
huge
festering
wound
in
the
calf
of
his
leg
so
that
he
could
hardly
hobble
along
with
a
stick
he
was
probably
on
his
way
to
the
medical
missionary
at
for
treatment
this
spiritual
guide
was
certainly
on
his
last
legs
and
has
probably
by
this
time
handed
over
the
priestly
robes
and
official
perquisites
to
more
vigorous
young
blood
hsiakwan

reminded
me
of
the
main

of
totnes
with
its

over

and
the

might
have
deluded
one
into
the
belief
that
he
was

he
gazed
upon

here
i
saw
the

a
finer
set
of
men

have
rarely
seen
in

is

my
men
somehow
got
the
false
information
that
he
was
a
native
of
so
they
all
went
down
on
their
knees
and
bumped
their
heads
on
the
ground
before
the
image
this
yang
however
was
such
a
brute
of
a
man
that
no
young
girl
was
safe
where
he
was
however
as
a
soldier
he
was
indomitable
the
temple

which
he
is
deified

called
the

there
is
no
place
in
all
china
where
is
worshipped
with
such
relentless
vigor
some
years
ago
so
the
wags
say
when
was
threatened
by
rebels
saved
the
city
by
transforming
herself
into
a
herculean
creature
and
carrying
upon
her
back
a
stone
of
several
tons
weight
presumably
to
block
the
path
the
amazement
of
the
rebels
at
the
sight
of
a
woman
performing
such
a
feat
made
them
wonder
what
the
men
could
be
like
so
they
turned
tail
and
fled
the
story

believed
implicitly
by
the
residents
of

the
priests

crowded
with

detail
i
am
not
the
first
traveler
who
has
remarked
this
several
of
archibald
little
books
speak
of
it
he
says
in
europe
except
where
the
scenery
is
purely
wild
and
more
especially
in
america
the
delight
of
gazing
on
many
of
the
most
beautiful
scenes
is
often
alloyed
by
the
crude
newness
of
man
work
this
is
true
now
of
japan
since
the
rage
for
copying
western
architecture
and
dress
has
fallen
upon
the
islands
of
the
rising
sun
but
here
in
western
china
little
has
intervened
to
mar
the
accord
between
nature
and
man
in
the
country
on
which
we
are
now
entering
the
natural
grandeur
is
finer
than
anything
i
had
seen
since
i
left
the
gorges
and
incidentally
i
do
not
mind
confessing
to
the
indulgent
reader
that
when
i
came
again
through
hsiakwan
again
westward
bound
i
was
tired
my
feet
were
blistered
and
broken
each
day
and
every
day
had
brought
me
a
hard
journey
and
here
i
was
now
facing
the
most
difficult
journey
yet
met
with
literally
not
a
li
of
level
road
my
journey
was
by

two

perched

could
never

it
is
merely
a
ramshackle
place
which
gives
one
sleep
and

the

all

their
ways
of

however
are
aboriginal
and
still
far
from
the
ideal
to
which
they
aspire
they
are
poor
poor
as
church
mice
dirty
and
diseased
and
decrepit
and
their

as
a

is
dreary
and
dull

of

sad
lowly
females
bind
their
feet
after

fashion
but
as
they
work
in
the
fields
climb
hills
and
battle
in
negotiations
against
nature
where
she
is
overcome
only
with
extreme
effort
the
real

is
a
thing
possible
with
them

give
themselves

i
stayed
here
the
sunday
and
as
i
went
through
my
evening
ablutions
among
my
admirers
in
the
doorway
was
an
old
woman
who
in
gentlest
confidences
with
my
boy
explained
awkwardly
that
her
little
daughter
lay
sick
of
a
fever
and
could
he
prevail
upon
his
foreign
master
in
whom
she
placed
implicit
faith
to
come
with
her
and
minister
lao
chang
advised
that
i
should
go
and
i
went
my
shins
got
mutilated
as
i
fell
down
the
slippery
stone
steps
in
the
dark
into
a
pail
of
hog
wash
at
the
bottom
having
wiped
the
worst
of
the
grease
and
slime
onto
the
mud
wall
by
the
aid
of
a
flickering
rushlight
i
saw
the
child
who
lay
on
a
mattress
on
the
floor
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
room
i
reckoned
her
age
to
be
her
black
hair
hung
in
tangled
masses
the
very
bed
on
which
she
lay
stank
with
vermin
two
feet
away
was
the
fire
where
all
the
cooking
was
gone
through
and
everywhere
around
was
filth
when
she
saw
me
the
child
raised
her
solitary
garment
whispered
that
pains
in
her
stomach
were
unendurable
that
her
head
ached
that
her
joints
were
stiff
that
she
was
generally
wrong
and
did
i
think
she
would
recover
i
thought
she
might
not
rushing
back
to
my
medicine
chest
i
brought
along
and
administered
a
maximum
dose
of
the
oil
called
castor
and
later
dosed
her
with
quinine
in
the
morning
she
was
out
and
about
her
work
while
the
old
mother
was
great
in
her
praises
for
the
passing
european
who
had
cured
her
child
after
that
came
the
deluge
they
wanted
more
medicine
fever
elixir
toothache
cure
and
so
on
and
so
on
but
i
stood
firm
the
tedium
of
the
sunday
in
that
draughty
inn
gave
me
an
insight
into
their
common
lives
which
i
had
not
before
causing
me
to
meditate
upon
their
simple
lives
and
their
simple
needs
they
did
not
raise
the
forests
in
order
to
get
gold
they
did
not
squander
their
patrimony
in
youth
destroying
in
a
day
the
fruit
of
long
years
they
held
to
simple
needs
they
had
a
simplicity
of
taste
which
was
also
a
peculiar
source
of
independence
and
safety
the
more
simple
they
lived
the
more
secure
their
future
because
they
were
less
at
the
mercy
of
surprises
and
reverses
in
adversity
these
people
would
not
act
like
nurslings
deprived
of
their
bottles
and
their
rattles
but
would
by
virtue
of
their
common
simplicity
probably
be
better
armed
for
any
struggles
i
do
not
desire
the
life
for
myself
but
the
ethics
of
their
simple
living
can
not
but
be
recommended
multitudes
possess
in
china
what
multitudes
in
the
west
pursue
amid
characteristic
hampering
futilities
of
european
life
we
would
aspire
to
simple
living
and
the
simplicity
of
olden
times
in
manners
art
and
ideas
is
still
cherished
and
reverenced
but
we
can
not
be
simple
or
return
to
the
simplicity
of
our
forefathers
unless
we
return
to
the
spirit
which
animated
them
they
possessed
the
spirit
of
real
simplicity
and
this
same
spirit
the
chinese
possess
but
they
are
minus
the
incomparable
features
of
healthful
civilization
inward
and
outward
of
which
our
forebears
were
masters
our
ways
are
not
their
ways
and
their
ways
not
our
ways
but
one
can
not
but
realize
as
he
moves
among
them
that
with
a
happy
infusion
of
the
spirit
of
their
simplicity
into
the
restlessness
of
our
modern
life
our
wearied
minds
would
dream
less
and
realize
more
of
the
true
simplicity
of
simple
living
to
a
man
the
village
of
turned
out
early
on
the
monday
morning
to
express
regrets
that
my
departure
was
at
hand
when
in
parting
with
this
people
who
had
done
all
in
their
power
to
make
my
comfort
complete
i
threw
a
handful
of
cash
to
some
little
children
standing
wonderingly
near
by
general
approval
was
expressed
and
elaborate
felicities
anent
my
beneficence
exchanged
by
the
lolo
women
a
short
apron
hung
down
over
their
blue
trousers
and
as
i
passed
out
of
their
sight
they
admired
me
and
gossiped
about
me
with
their
hands
under
their
aprons
in
much
the
same
manner
as
their
more
enlightened
sisters
of
the
gossip
sometimes
in
the
west
it
was
a
beautiful
spring
morning
the
sweet
song
of
the
birds
pierced
through
the
noise
of
the
rolling
river
below
the
air
was
fragrant
and
bracing
and
as
i
left
and
commenced
the
rocky
ascent
leading
again
to
the
mountains
the
barks
of
some
canines
who
alone
objected
to
my
presence
among
the
died
away
with
the
rustle
of
the
leafage
in
a
keen
north
wind
one
of
my
men
was
poorly
the
solitary
element
to
disturb
the
equanimity
of
our
camp
it
was
shanks
he
had
been
suffering
from
toothache
and
unfortunately
i
had
no
with
me
without
my
knowledge
lao
chang
had
rubbed
in
some
strong
embrocation
to
the
fellow
cheek
so
that
now
in
addition
to
toothache
he
had
also
a
badly
blistered
face
swollen
up
like
a
pudding
upon
learning
that
i
had
no
means
of
curing
him
or
of
alleviating
the
pain
shanks
bellowed
into
my
ear
loud
enough
to
bring
the
dead
out
of
the
on
the
surrounding
puh
teh
pub
teh
then
raising
his
to
the
correct
angle
on
the
hump
on
his
back
went
merrily
forward
warbling
some
squealing
chinese
ditty
but
shanks
was
the
songster
of
the
party
he
often
madly
disturbed
the
silence
of
middle
night
by
a
sudden
outburst
inte
song
and
when
shouted
down
by
others
who
lay
around
or
kicked
by
the
man
who
shared
his
bed
and
whose
choral
propensities
were
less
in
proportion
he
would
laugh
wildly
at
them
all
poor
shanks
he
was
a
peculiar
mortal
he
would
laugh
at
men
in
pain
and
think
it
sympathy
if
we
could
get
no
food
or
drink
on
the
march
after
having
wearily
toiled
away
for
hours
he
would
not
be
disposed
to
grumble
he
would
laugh
such
tragic
incidents
as
the
pony
jumping
over
the
precipice
provoked
him
to
extreme
laughter
ax
and
when
i
caught
him
sewing
up
an
open
wound
in
the
sole
of
his
foot
with
common
colored
chinese
thread
and
a
rusty
needle
and
told
him
that
he
might
thereby
get
blood
poisoning
and
lose
his
life
or
leg
he
cared
not
a
little
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
laughed
in
my
face
not
at
me
not
at
all
but
because
he
thought
his
laughter
might
probably
delude
the
devil
who
was
president
over
the
ills
of
that
particular
portion
of
human
anatomy
he
came
to
me
just
outside
where
we
saw
a
coffin
containing
a
corpse
resting
in
the
roadway
whilst
the
bearers
refreshed
near
by
and
pointing
thereto
told
me
that
the
man
was
muh
tsai
not
here
the
chinese
never
on
any
account
mention
the
word
death
and
his
sides
shook
with
laughter
so
much
so
that
he
dropped
his
loads
alongside
the
corpse
and
startled
the
cock
on
top
of
the
coffin
guarding
the
spirit
of
the
dead
into
a
vigorous
fit
of
crowing
for
fear
of
disaster
we
enjoyed
fairly
level
road
although
rough
for
ten
li
after
leaving
it
rose
gradually
from
feet
to
feet
and
then
dipped
suddenly
and
continued
at
a
fearful
down
gradient
i
might
describe
it
as
a
member
of
a
british
infantry
regiment
once
described
to
me
a
slope
on
the
himalayas
it
was
about
eight
years
ago
and
a
few
fellows
were
at
a
smoker
given
to
some
tommies
returning
from
india
when
a
individual
talking
about
a
long
march
his
battalion
had
made
up
the
himalayas
in
excellent
descriptive
exclaimed
a
was
a
graydyent
was
a
blooming
precipice
guvnor
the
himalayas
and
the
country
i
am
now
describing
have
therefore
something
in
common
just
before
this
the
beautiful
mountains
behind
which
was
the
lake
made
a
sight
worth
coming
a
long
way
to
see
midway
down
the
steep
hill
we
happened
on
some
lonely
log
cottages
li
from
it
is
reckoned
as
li
traveling
in
the
opposite
direction
in
the
forest
district
i
found
the
houses
all
built
of
timber
wood
piles
placed
horizontally
and
dovetailed
at
the
ends
the
roofs
being
thatched
you
have
merely
to
step
aside
from
the
road
and
you
are
in
dense
mountain
forest
it
is
manifestly
easier
and
less
costly
than
the
habitation
although
for
their
part
the
people
are
worse
off
because
of
the
lack
of
available
ground
for
growing
their
crops
here
the
people
were
still
essentially
lolo
and
the
women
who
boiled
water
under
a
shed
had
difficulty
in
getting
to
understand
what
my
men
were
talking
about
the
second
descent
is
begun
after
a
pleasant
walk
along
level
ground
resembling
a
estate
and
a
treacherously
rough
mile
brought
us
down
to
an
iron
chain
bridge
swung
over
the
ho
at
the
far
end
of
which
hidden
behind
bamboo
matting
are
a
few
idols
in
an
old
hut
they
act
in
the
dual
capacity
of
gods
of
the
river
and
the
mountain
tea
and
some
palatable
baked
persimmon
very
like
figs
when
baked
were
brought
me
by
an
biped
who
was
still
in
mourning
his
unshaven
skull
sadly
betokening
the
fact
as
i
sipped
my
tea
and
cracked
jokes
with
some
men
who
declared
they
had
met
me
in
i
must
resemble
in
appearance
a
european
resident
in
that
city
it
was
the
fourth
time
i
had
been
accused
of
living
there
i
admired
the
grand
scenery
farther
along
especially
did
i
notice
one
peak
towering
perpendicularly
away
up
past
woods
of
pine
and
fir
trees
the
crystal
summit
glistening
with
sunlit
snow
as
soon
as
i
started
again
on
my
journey
i
was
pulling
up
towards
it
soon
i
was
gazing
down
upon
the
tiny
patches
of
light
green
and
a
few
solitary
cottages
resembling
a
little
beehive
and
one
could
imagine
the
metaphorical
and
of
the
inhabitants
these
people
were
away
from
all
mankind
living
in
loneliness
and
all
unconscious
of
the
distinguished
foreigner
away
up
yonder
who
wondered
at
their
patient
toiling
but
who
like
them
had
his
yesterday
and
there
they
were
perched
high
up
on
the
bleak
mountain
sides
with
their
joys
and
sorrows
their
pains
and
penalties
struggling
along
in
domestic
squalor
and
rearing
young
rusticity
and
raw
produce
on
these
mountains
in
one
sees
hundreds
of
such
little
encampments
of
a
few
families
passing
their
existence
far
from
the
road
of
the
traveler
who
often
wished
he
could
descend
to
them
and
quench
his
thirst
and
eat
with
them
their
rice
and
maize
most
of
them
here
were
isolated
families
of
tribespeople
who
out
of
contact
with
their
kind
have
little
left
of
racial
resemblance
and
yet
are
not
fully
chinese
so
that
it
is
difficult
to
tell
what
they
really
are
most
were
lolo
walking
here
was
treacherous
a
foot
pathway
was
the
main
road
winding
in
and
out
high
along
the
surface
of
the
hills
in
many
places
washed
away
and
in
others
overgrown
with
grass
and
shrubbery
across
china
on
foot
would
have
met
an
untimely
end
had
i
made
a
false
step
or
slipped
on
the
loose
stones
in
a
momentary
overbalance
i
should
have
rolled
down
seven
hundred
feet
into
the
ho
once
during
the
morning
i
saw
my
coolies
high
up
on
a
ledge
opposite
to
me
and
on
practically
the
same
level
a
gully
dividing
us
they
were
very
small
men
under
very
big
hats
bustling
along
like
busy
lilliputians
and
my
loads
looked
like
i
probably
looked
to
them
not
less
grotesque
but
we
had
to
watch
our
footsteps
and
not
each
other
we
were
rounding
a
corner
when
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
couple
of
li
away
the
were
making
considerable
hue
and
cry
because
rusty
had
rolled
thirty
feet
down
the
incline
and
as
i
looked
i
saw
the
animal
get
up
and
commence
neighing
because
he
had
lost
sight
of
us
he
was
in
the
habit
of
wandering
on
nibbling
a
little
here
and
a
little
there
and
rarely
gave
trouble
unless
in
chasing
an
occasional
horse
caravan
when
he
gave
my
men
some
fun
in
getting
him
again
into
line
it
was
not
yet
midday
and
we
had
four
hours
good
going
so
i
calculated
not
so
my
men
they
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
budge
and
knowing
the
chinese
just
a
little
i
reluctantly
kept
quiet
it
was
entirely
unreasonable
to
expect
them
to
go
on
to
ninety
li
away
it
was
impossible
and
i
learnt
that
the
reason
they
would
not
go
on
was
that
no
house
this
side
of
that
place
was
good
enough
to
put
a
horse
into
even
a
chinese
horse
and
they
would
not
dream
of
taking
me
on
under
those
conditions
there
was
not
even
a
hut
available
for
the
traveler
so
they
said
i
had
come
over
difficult
country
plodding
upwards
on
tiptoe
and
then
downwards
with
a
lazy
swing
from
stone
to
stone
for
miles
throughout
the
day
we
had
been
going
through
fine
mountain
forest
everywhere
peaceful
and
beautiful
but
it
had
been
hard
going
in
the
morning
a
heavy
frost
lay
thick
and
white
about
us
and
by
the
sun
was
playing
down
upon
us
with
a
merciless
heat
as
we
tramped
over
that
little
red
line
through
the
green
of
the
often
in
this
march
was
i
tempted
to
stay
and
sit
down
on
the
sward
but
i
had
proved
this
to
be
fatal
to
walking
in
traveling
in
one
practice
should
be
start
early
have
as
few
stops
as
possible
when
a
stop
made
let
it
be
long
enough
for
a
real
rest
in
where
the
tea
houses
are
much
more
frequent
men
will
pull
up
every
ten
li
and
generally
make
ten
minutes
of
it
in
these
welcome
refreshment
houses
are
not
met
with
so
often
and
little
inducement
is
held
out
for
the
coolies
to
stop
but
upon
the
slightest
provocation
they
will
stop
for
a
smoke
on
this
walking
trip
i
made
it
a
rule
to
be
off
by
seven
stop
twice
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
up
to
tiffin
my
men
stopped
oftener
when
our
rest
was
often
for
an
hour
so
that
we
were
all
refreshed
and
ready
to
push
on
for
the
of
the
stage
we
generally
were
done
by
four
or
five
and
i
should
be
the
last
in
the
world
to
deny
that
by
this
time
i
had
had
enough
for
one
day
upon
arrival
i
immediately
washed
my
feet
an
excellent
practice
of
the
chinese
changed
my
footgear
drank
many
cups
of
tea
and
often
went
straight
to
my
the
roads
of

take
it
out
of
the
strongest

there
are
no
marathon
runners
here
progress
is
a
tedious
toil
often
on
all
fours
my
room
at
was
near
a
telegraph
pole
there
was
a
telegraph
station
there
where
my
men
showed
their
admiration
for
the
governmental
organization
by
at
once
hammering
nails
into
the
pole
it
was
close
to
their
laundry
and
served
admirably
for
the
a
bamboo
tied
at
one
end
with
a
string
to
a
nail
in
the
pole
and
the
other
end
stuck
through
the
paper
in
the
window
of
the
telegraph
apartment
but
this
is
nothing
years
ago
when
the
telegraph
was
first
laid
down
the
people
took
turns
to
displace
the
wires
and
sell
them
for
their
trouble
and
to
chop
the
poles
up
for
firewood
it
continued
for
a
considerable
period
until
an
offender
or
one
whom
it
was
surmised
had
done
this
or
would
have
done
it
if
he
could
had
his
ears
cut
off
and
was
led
over
the
main
road
to
the
capital
to
be
admired
by
any
compatriot
contemplating
a
deal
in
wiring
or
timber
used
for
telegraphic
communication
purposes
just
below
the
town
the
river
ran
peacefully
down
a
gradual
incline
i
decided
that
a
comfortable
seat
under
a
tree
spending
an
hour
in
preparing
this
copy
would
be
more
pleasant
than
moping
about
a
noisome
and
inn
providing
precious
little
in
the
way
of
entertainment
for
the
foreigner
next
door
a
wedding
party
was
making
the
afternoon
hideous
with
their
gongs
and
drums
and
crackers
and
everywhere
the
usual
hue
and
cry
went
abroad
because
a
european
was
spending
the
day
there
i
imparted
to
my
man
my
intentions
for
the
afternoon
immediately
preparations
were
set
on
foot
to
get
me
down
by
the
river
and
it
was
publicly
announced
to
the
townspeople
the
news
ran
throughout
the
town
that
is
one
little
narrow
street
a
sad
mixture
of
a
military
trench
and
a
west
of
england
cobbled
court
and
instead
of
going
alone
to
my
shady
nook
by
that
silvery
stream
was
accompanied
by
nine
adult
members
of
the
unemployed
band
three
boys
and
sundry
urchins
who
seemed
to
be
without
home
or
habitation
one
of
these
specimens
of
fleeting
friendship
was
and
a
diseased
hip
rendered
it
difficult
for
him
to
keep
pace
with
us
one
was
one
fellow
had
only
half
a
nose
and
they
were
nearly
all
goitrous
as
i
write
now
these
people
curious
but
not
uncouth
are
crouched
around
me
on
their
haunches
after
the
fashion
of
the
ape
their
more
companion
and
his
shorthand
notes
being
admired
by
an
crowd
down
below
my
horse

entertaining
the
more
hilarious
of
the
party
in
his
tantrums
with
the
man
who
is
trying

him

the
day
before

were
passing
along
the
edge
of

we
saw
a
deliberate
suicide
on
the
part
of
a
pony
getting
away
from
its
companions
it
first
jumped
against
a
tree
then
turned

touched

fifty

rolled

exhibited

laughed

down

sheer
up

in

contrast

in

being
antithetical
and
weird
with
the
magnificent

standing
up
as
a
beautiful
background
of
perpendicular
white
from
whence
range
upon
range
of
dark
lines
loom
out
in
the
hazy
atmosphere
from
the
extreme
summit
of
one
peak
whose
white
steeple
seems
truly
a
finger
i
gaze
abstractedly
all
around
upon
nothing
but
dark
masses
of
hills
steep
weary
ascents
and
descents
green
and
gold
and
yellow
and
brown
and
one
eyes
rest
upon
a
maze
of
thin
white
lines
intertwining
them
all
these
are
the
main
roads
i
am
alone
my
men
are
far
behind
i
am
awed
with
an
unnatural
sense
of
bewildered
wonderment
in
the
midst
of
all
this
glory
of
the
earth
everything
is
so
vast
so
grand
so
overpowering
murmurings
of
the
birds
alone
break
the
sense
of
sadness
and
loneliness
away
yonder
pine
trees
if
discernible
at
all
are
dwarfed
so
as
to
appear
like
long
coarse
grass
for
some
thirty
li
the
road
runs
through
beautiful
woods
high
above
the
valleys
and
the
noise
of
the
river
and
now
we
are
running
down
swiftly
to
a
point
where
two
ranges
meet
only
to
toil
on
again
slowly
and
wearily
up
an
awful
gradient
for
two
hours
or
more
but
the
labor
and
all
its
fatiguing
arduousness
are
nothing
when
one
gets
to
the
top
for
one
beholds
here
one
of
the
most
magnificent
mountain
panoramas
in
all
west
china
far
away
just
peeping
prettily
from
the
silvered
edges
of
the
bursting
clouds
are
the
giant
peaks
which
separate
from
white
giants
with
rugged
cruel
edges
pointing
upwards
piercing
the
clouds
asunder
as
a
bow
pierces
the
billows
of
the
deep
and
then
gradually
coming
from
out
the
mist
are
no
less
than
eight
distinct
ranges
of
mountains
from
feet
to
feet
high
besides
innumerable
minor
heights
which
we
have
traversed
with
much
labor
during
the
past
four
days
all
rich
with
coloring
and
natural
grandeur
seen
but
seldom
in
all
the
world
switzerland
could
offer
nothing
finer
nothing
more
sweeping
nothing
more
beautiful
nothing
more
with
the
glorious
grandeur
of
these
wondrous
hills
rising
and
falling
playfully
around
the
main
ranges
the
marvellous
tree
growth
the
delicate
contrasts
of
the
formidable
peaks
and
the
dainty
cultivated
valleys
and
the
face
of
nature
everywhere
absolutely
unmarred
switzerland
could
in
no
way
compare
is
it
then
surprising
that
i
look
upon
these
stupendous
masses
with
wonder
which
seem
to
breathe
only
eternity
and
immensity
the
air
is
pure
as
the
breath
of
heaven
all
is
still
and
peaceful
and
the
fact
that
in
the
very
nature
of
things
one
can
not
rush
through
this
pervading
beauty
of
the
earth
but
has
to
plod
onwards
step
by
step
along
a
toilsome
roadway
enables
the
scenery
to
be
so
impressed
upon
one
mind
as
to
be
focussed
for
life
in
one
memory
one
is
held
spellbound
these
are
the
pictures
never
forgotten
here
i
sit
in
a
corner
of
the
earth
as
old
as
the
world
itself
these
mountains
are
as
they
were
in
the
great
beginning
when
the
creator
and
sustainer
of
all
things
pure
and
beautiful
looked
upon
his
handiwork
and
saw
that
it
was
good
the
country
here
seems
so
vast
as
to
render
nature
unconquerable
by
man
man
is
insignificant
nature
is
triumphant
railways
are
defied
and
these
mountains
running
mostly
at
right
angles
will
probably
never
not
in
our
time
at
least
be
made
unsightly
by
the
puffing
and
the
reeking
of
the
modern
railway
engine
they
present
so
many
natural
obstacles
to
the
of
the
country
according
to
the
standard
we
westerners
lay
down
that
one
would
hesitate
to
prophesy
any
mode
of
traffic
here
other
than
that
of
the
horse
caravan
and
human
beast
of
burden
nature
seems
to
look
down
upon
man
and
his
contrivances
and
assert
man
begone
i
will
have
none
of
thee
and
the
mountains
turn
upwards
to
the
sky
silent
reverence
to
their
maker
whose
work
must
in
the
main
remain
unchanged
until
eternity
it
is
now
and
we
have
fifty
li
to
cover
before
reaching
we
sit
here
to
feed
at
a
place
called
a
sorry
antediluvian
of
a
building
where
in
subsequent
travel
i
was
hung
up
in
bitter
weather
and
had
to
pass
the
night
the
people
courteous
and
civil
as
always
show
a
simple
trustfulness
with
which
is
associated
some
little
suspicion
i
gave
a
cake
to
a
little
child
but
its
mother
would
not
allow
it
to
be
eaten
until
she
was
again
and
again
assured
and
reassured
that
it
was
quite
fit
to
eat
this
home
life
of
the
very
poor
chinese
if
indeed
it
may
be
called
home
life
has
a
listlessness
about
it
in
marked
contrast
to
that
of
the
west
there
is
little
housework
no
furniture
more
than
a
table
and
chair
or
two
and
the
simplicity
of
the
cooking
arrangements
does
not
tend
to
increase
the
work
of
the
housewife
people
here
are
going
about
their
work
with
a
restful
deliberation
very
trying
to
one
in
a
hurry
the
women
with
infants
tied
to
their
backs
do
not
work
hard
but
very
long
a
is
being
built
near
by
and
between
the
cooking
and
attending
to
passing
travelers
two
women
are
digging
the
earth
and
filling
up
the
baskets
while
the
men
are
mixing
the
mud
filling
in
the
oblong
wooden
trough
and
thus
building
the
wall
at
my
elbow
a
man
old
and
grizzled
and
dirty
is
turning
back
roll
upon
roll
of
his
wadded
garments
and
ridding
it
of
as
many
as
he
can
find
of
the
insects
with
which
it
is
infested
a
slobbering
cretin
chops
wood
at
my
side
and
when
i
rise
to
try
a
snap
on
the
women
and
the
children
they
hide
behind
the
walls
thus
my
time
passes
away
as
i
wait
for
the
coolies
who
sit
on
a
log
in
the
open
road
feeding
on
common
basins
of
dry
rice
after
that
we
had
to
cross
the
face
of
a
steep
hill
we
could
however
find
no
road
no
pathway
even
but
could
merely
see
the
scratchings
of
coolies
and
ponies
already
crossed
it
was
an
achievement
not
unrisky
but
we
managed
to
reach
the
other
side
without
mishap
my
horse
owing
to
the
stupidity
of
the
man
who
hung
on
to
his
mouth
to
steady
himself
put
his
foot
in
a
hole
and
dragged
the
fool
of
a
fellow
some
twenty
yards
downwards
in
the
mud
my
coolies
themselves
in
a
spot
most
dangerous
to
their
own
necks
stuck
the
outside
leg
deep
in
the
mud
to
rest
themselves
and
set
to
assiduously
in
blackguarding
the
man
in
their
richest
vein
then
extricating
themselves
again
continued
their
journey
satisfied
that
they
had
shown
the
proper
front
and
saved
the
face
of
the
foreigner
who
could
not
save
it
for
himself
then
we
all
went
down
through
a
narrow
ravine
into
a
lovely
shady
glade
all
green
and
refreshing
with
a
brook
gurgling
sweetly
at
the
foot
and
birds
singing
in
the
foliage
there
was
something
very
quaint
in
this
cosy
corner
with
the
hideous
echoes
and
weird
of
my
squealing
then
we
went
on
again
from
hill
to
hill
in
a
footway
broken
and
washed
away
so
that
in
places
it
was
necessary
to
hang
on
to
the
evergrowing
grass
to
keep
one
footing
in
the
slopes
one
needs
to
have
no
nerves
in
china
down
in
the
valley
were
a
number
of
muleteers
from
burma
cooking
their
rice
in
copper
pans
whilst
their
ponies
most
of
them
in
horrid
condition
and
backs
rubbed
in
some
places
to
the
extent
of
twelve
inches
square
grazed
on
the
in
most
places
the
foot
of
this
ravine
would
have
been
a
river
here
it
was
like
a
park
with
pretty
green
sward
intersected
by
a
narrow
path
leading
down
into
a
lane
so
thick
with
virgin
growth
as
to
exclude
the
sunlight
as
we
entered
a
man
came
out
with
his
and
himself
on
the
back
of
a
pony
the
animal
shied
and
his
manservant
got
behind
and
laid
on
mighty
blows
with
the
of
a
gun
he
was
carrying
the
pony
ceased
shying
to
was
a
tedious
journey
rising
and
falling
across
the
wooded
hills
and
when
we
arrived
at
some
cottages
by
the
riverside
the
had
a
rough
time
of
it
from
my
men
for
having
brought
us
by
a
long
road
instead
of
by
the
new
road
so
called
although
i
do
not
doubt
that
it
has
been
in
use
for
many
generations
some
coolies
and
myself
had
rice
together
on
a
low
form
away
from
the
smoke
and
the
while
listened
to
some
tales
of
old
told
by
some
goitrous
monster
who
seemed
sadly
out
at
elbow
the
soldier
meantime
smelt
round
for
a
smoke
as
he
and
my
men
had
decided
a
few
moments
ago
that
each
party
was
of
a
very
low
order
of
humanity
their
pipes
for
him
were
not
available
so
he
took
pipe
and
dried
leaf
tobacco
from
this
skunk
who
having
wiped
the
stem
in
his
pants
handed
it
over
in
a
manner
befitting
a
monarch
it
measured
some
sixty
or
seventy
inches
from
stem
to
bowl
from
to
is
reckoned
as
eighty
li
it
is
quite
one
hundred
and
ten
and
the
last
part
of
the
journey
over
barren
hills
most
fatiguing
in
contrast
to
the
beauty
of
the
morning
scenery
the
country
was
black
and
bare
and
a
gale
blew
in
our
faces
my
spirits
were
raised
however
by
a
coolie
who
joined
us
and
who
had
a
remarkable
knowledge
of
the
whole
of
the
west
of
china
from
to
singai
from
mengtsz
to
plied
with
questions
he
willingly
gave
his
answers
but
he
would
persist
in
leading
the
way
as
soon
as
a
man
endeavored
to
pass
him
he
would
trot
off
at
a
wonderful
speed
making
no
ado
of
the
pounds
of
china
pots
on
his
back
yelling
his
explanations
all
the
time
to
the
man
behind
lay
over
to
the
right
fifteen
li
from
which
is
protected
from
the
elements
by
a
hill
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
lit
up
with
gold
from
the
sinking
sun
which
dipped
as
i
trudged
along
the
uneven
zigzag
road
leading
across
the
plain
of
peas
and
beans
and
winter
crops
four
planks
placed
at
various
dangerous
angles
on
three
wood
trestles
form
the
bridge
across
the
stream
dividing
from
the
world
on
the
opposite
side
across
this
i
saw
men
wander
with
their
loads
and
then
i
led
rusty
in
whilst
the
stream
washed
his
legs
i
sat
dangling
mine
until
called
upon
to
make
way
for
another
party
of
travelers
remarkable
is
the
agility
of
these
men
they
swing
along
over
eight
inches
of
wood
as
if
they
were
in
the
middle
of
a
road
is
a
mohammedan
town
there
are
a
few
chinese
only
buddhists
taoists
and
other
ragtags
although
when
the
follower
of
the
prophet
has
his
pigtail
attached
to
the
inside
of
his
hat
as
it
not
unusual
when
he
goes
out
fully
dressed
there
is
little
difference
between
him
and
the
chinese
pigs
here
are
conspicuously
absent
people
feed
on
poultry
and
beef
i
rested
in
this
city
some
month
or
so
after
my
first
overland
trip
whilst
my
man
went
to
convert
silver
into
cash
a
trying
ordeal
always
whilst
i
sipped
my
tea
and
ate
a
couple
of
rice
cakes
i
was
impressed
as
i
seldom
have
been
in
my
wanderings
with
the
remarkable
number
of
people
from
the
six
hundred
odd
houses
the
town
possesses
who
during
that
found
nothing
whatever
to
do
to
benefit
themselves
or
the
community
as
members
of
which
they
passed
monotonous
lives
but
to
stare
aimlessly
at
the
resting
foreigner
the
report
spread
like
wildfire
and
they
ran
to
the
scene
with
haste
pulling
on
their
coats
wiping
food
from
their
mouths
scratching
their
heads
one
up
and
the
other
down
all
anxious
to
get
a
seat
near
the
stage
a
river
flows
down
the
center
of
the
street
and
into
this
a
sleepy
fellow
got
tipped
bodily
in
the
crush
sat
down
in
the
water
seemingly
in
no
hurry
to
move
until
he
had
finished
his
vigorous
bullying
of
the
man
who
pushed
him
in
those
who
could
not
get
standing
room
near
my
table
went
out
into
the
street
and
shaded
the
sun
from
their
eyes
in
order
that
they
might
catch
even
a
glimpse
of
the
traveler
who
sat
on
in
uncompromising
indifference
several
old
wags
were
there
who
had
witnessed
the
rebellion
at
the
moment
had
i
not
become
callous
another
might
have
seemed
imminent
and
were
looked
up
to
by
the
crowd
as
heroes
of
a
horrid
past
being
listened
to
with
rapt
attention
as
they
described
what
it
was
the
crowd
looked
at
and
whence
it
came
had
i
been
a
wild
animal
let
loose
from
its
cage
mingled
curiosity
and
a
peculiar
foreboding
among
the
people
of
something
terrible
about
to
happen
could
not
have
been
more
intense
but
i
had
by
this
time
got
used
to
their
crowding
so
that
i
could
write
sleep
eat
drink
and
be
merry
and
go
through
personal
and
private
routine
with
no
embarrassment
if
i
turned
for
the
purpose
i
could
easily
stare
out
of
face
a
member
of
the
crowd
whose
inquisitive
propensities
had
become
annoying
but
as
soon
as
he
left
another
filled
the
gap
quite
pitiful
was
it
to
see
how
trivial
articles
of
foreign
manufacture
such
for
instance
as
the
cover
of
an
ordinary
tin
or
the
fabric
of
one
clothing
brought
a
regular
deluge
of
childish
interest
and
inane
questioning
and
if
i
happened
to
make
a
few
shorthand
notes
upon
anything
making
a
particular
impression
a
look
half
surprised
half
amused
went
from
one
to
another
like
an
electric
current
had
i
been
scheming
out
celestial
hieroglyphics
their
mouths
could
not
have
opened
wider
as
i
write
now
i
am
asked
by
a
respectable
person
how
many
ounces
of
silver
a
johann
faber
costs
i
have
told
him
and
he
has
retired
smiling
evidently
thinking
that
i
am
romancing
that
i
impress
the
crowd
everywhere
is
evident
but
with
all
their
questioning
they
are
rarely
rude
their
stare
is
simply
the
stare
of
little
children
seeing
a
thing
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
it
is
all
so
hard
to
understand
my
silver
and
my
gold
they
solicit
not
they
merely
desire
to
see
me
and
to
feel
me
a
certain
faction
of
the
crowd
however
do
solicit
my
silver
lao
chang
has
been
buying
vegetables
and
has
brought
all
the
vegetable
gardeners
and
greengrocers
around
me
the
poultry
rearers
are
here
too
and
the
forage
dealers
and
the
grass
cutters
and
the
basket
makers
and
other
thrifty
members
of
the
commercial
order
of
humankind
when
i
came
away
the
people
dropped
into
line
and
strained
their
necks
to
get
a
parting
smile
i
was
sped
on
my
way
with
a
public
curiosity
as
if
i
were
a
penal
servitor
released
from
prison
a
general
home
from
a
war
or
something
of
that
kind
and
so
this
wonderful
wonder
of
wonders
was
glad
when
he
emerged
from
the
labyrinthic
bewilderment
of
chinese
interior
life
of
this
town
into
somewhat
clearer
regions
i
could
not
understand
and
to
the
wisest
man
wide
as
may
be
his
vision
the
chinese
mind
and
character
remain
of
a
depth
as
infinite
as
is
its
possibility
of
expansion
the
volume
of
chinese
nature
is
one
of
which
as
yet
but
the
alphabet
is
known
to
us
my
own
men
had
got
quite
used
to
me
and
their
minds
were
directed
more
to
working
than
to
wondering
in
china
as
in
other
asiatic
countries
one
companions
soon
accustom
themselves
to
one
little
peculiarities
of
character
and
what
was
miraculous
to
the
crowd
had
by
simple
repetition
ceased
to
be
miraculous
to
them
as
i
put
away
my
notebook
after
writing
the
last
sentence
i
saw
a
mule
slip
fall
roll
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
losing
its
load
on
the
down
journey
and
then
walk
up
to
the
stream
for
a
drink
az
we
started
for
shayung
on
february
going
over
a
road
literally
uncared
for
full
of
stones
and
sinking
sand
down
which
ponies
scrambled
while
the
tibetans
in
charge
covered
themselves
close
in
the
uncured
skins
they
wore
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
seen
tibetans
they
had
huge
in
their
ears
and
their
antiquated
topboots
much
better
however
than
the
topboot
gave
them
a
peculiar
appearance
as
they
tramped
downward
in
the
frost
going
up
with
us
was
a
chinese
on
the
back
of
a
pony
not
more
than
eleven
hands
high
sitting
as
usual
with
his
paraphernalia
lashed
to
the
back
of
the
animal
he
laughed
at
me
because
i
was
not
riding
whilst
i
tried
to
solve
the
problem
of
that
indefinable
trait
of
chinese
nature
which
leads
men
with
sound
feet
to
sit
on
these
little
brutes
up
those
terrible
mountain
sides
some
parts
of
this
spur
were
much
steeper
than
the
roof
of
a
house
as
perpendicular
as
can
be
imagined
but
still
this
man
held
on
all
the
way
and
the
chinese
do
it
continuously
whether
the
pony
is
lame
or
not
at
least
the
majority
but
the
cruelty
of
the
chinese
is
probably
not
regarded
as
cruelty
certainly
not
in
the
sense
of
cruelty
in
the
west
being
chinese
with
customs
and
laws
of
life
such
as
they
are
their
instinct
of
cruelty
is
excusable
to
some
degree
not
only
is
it
with
animals
however
but
among
themselves
the
chinese
have
no
mercy
no
sympathy
in
christian
england
within
the
last
century
men
where
hanged
for
petty
theft
but
in
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
still
current
in
other
provinces
men
have
been
known
to
be
burnt
to
death
for
stealing
maize
a
case
was
reported
from
quite
recently
but
it
is
a
custom
which
used
to
be
quite
common
a
document
is
signed
by
the
relatives
a
stick
is
brought
by
every
villager
the
man
lashed
to
a
stake
and
his
own
people
are
compelled
to
light
the
fire
it
seems
incredible
but
this
horrible
practice
has
not
been
entirely
extirpated
by
the
authorities
although
since
the
rebellion
it
has
not
been
by
any
means
so
frequent
i
have
no
space
nor
inclination
to
deal
with
the
ghastly
tortures
inflicted
upon
prisoners
in
the
name
of
that
great
equivalent
to
justice
but
the
more
one
knows
of
them
the
more
can
he
appreciate
the
common
adage
urging
men
to
keep
out
of
hell
and
the
living
out
of
the
is
thirty
li
from
here
at
the
head
of
an
abominable
hill
and
here
women
overlooking
one
of
the
worst
paved
roads
in
the
empire
were
beating
out
corn
then
we
climbed
for
another
li
rising
from
feet
to
feet
till
we
came
to
a
little
place
called
it
took
us
three
hours
looking
backwards
towards
i
saw
my
feet
friends
and
as
we
went
down
the
other
side
over
a
splendid
stone
road
we
could
see
far
down
below
a
valley
which
seemed
a
veritable
oasis
smiling
and
sweet
a
temple
here
contained
a
battered
image
of
the
goddess
of
mercy
who
controls
the
births
of
children
a
poor
woman
was
depositing
a
few
cash
in
front
of
the
besmeared
idol
imploring
that
she
might
be
delivered
of
a
son
how
pitiable
it
is
to
see
these
poor
creatures
doing
this
sort
of
thing
all
over
the
west
of
china
for
two
days
we
had
been
accompanied
by
a
man
who
was
an
opium
smoker
and
eater
now
i
am
not
going
to
draw
a
horrible
description
of
a
shrivelled
wasted
bogey
in
man
form
with
creaking
bones
and
shivering
limbs
and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
i
must
say
that
this
man
towards
the
time
when
his
craving
came
upon
him
was
a
wreck
in
every
worst
sense
he
crept
away
to
the
wayside
and
smoked
and
arrived
always
late
at
night
at
the
end
of
the
stage
this
was
the
effect
of
the
drug
which
has
been
described
as
harmless
as
milk
i
do
not
exaggerate
in
the
course
of
eastern
journalistic
experience
i
have
written
much
in
defence
of
opium
have
paralleled
it
to
the
alcohol
of
my
own
country
this
was
in
the
straits
settlements
where
the
deadly
effects
of
opium
are
less
prominent
but
no
language
of
mine
can
exaggerate
the
evil
and
if
i
would
be
honest
i
can
not
describe
it
as
anything
but
china
most
awful
curse
it
can
not
be
compared
to
alcohol
because
its
grip
is
more
speedy
and
more
deadly
it
is
more
deadly
than
arsenic
because
by
arsenic
the
suicide
dies
at
once
while
the
opium
victim
suffers
untold
agonies
and
horrors
and
dies
by
inches
it
is
all
very
well
for
the
men
who
know
nothing
about
the
effect
of
opium
to
do
all
the
talking
about
the
harmlessness
of
this
pernicious
drug
but
they
should
come
through
this
once
fair
land
of
and
see
everywhere
not
in
isolated
districts
but
everywhere
the
ravaging
effects
in
the
poverty
and
dwarfed
constitutions
of
the
people
before
they
advocate
the
continuance
of
the
opium
trade
i
have
seen
men
transformed
to
beasts
through
its
use
i
have
seen
more
suicides
from
the
effect
of
opium
since
i
have
been
in
china
than
from
any
other
cause
in
the
course
of
my
life
as
i
write
i
have
around
me
painfullest
evidence
of
the
crudest
ravishings
of
opium
among
a
people
who
have
fallen
victims
to
the
craving
there
is
only
one
opinion
to
be
formed
if
to
himself
one
would
be
true
i
give
the
following
quotation
from
a
work
from
the
pen
of
one
of
the
most
diplomatists
who
have
ever
held
office
in
china
the
writer
has
seen
an
and
apparently
rugged
laboring
chinese
tumble
all
in
a
heap
upon
the
ground
utterly
nerveless
and
unable
to
stand
because
the
time
for
his
dose
of
opium
had
come
and
until
the
craving
was
supplied
he
was
no
longer
a
man
but
the
merest
heap
of
bones
and
flesh
in
the
majority
of
cases
death
is
the
sure
result
of
any
determined
reform
the
poison
has
rotted
the
whole
system
and
no
power
to
resist
the
simplest
disease
remains
in
many
residence
in
china
the
writer
knew
of
but
four
men
who
finally
abandoned
the
habit
where
opium
refuges
have
been
conducted
by
missionaries
reports
more
favorable
have
been
given
concerning
those
who
have
become
christians
three
of
them
lived
but
a
few
months
thereafter
the
fourth
survived
his
reformation
but
was
a
invalid
ba
much
good
work
is
now
being
done
by
the
missionaries
and
the
number
of
those
who
have
given
up
the
habit
has
probably
increased
since
holcombe
wrote
the
above
in
point
of
fact
helping
opium
victims
is
one
of
the
most
important
branches
of
mission
work
past
and

chester

footnotes
footnote
ay
the
range
of
mountains
which
i
had
skirted
since
leaving
footnote
az
on
my
return
journey
into
i
again
called
at
traveling
not
by
the
main
road
but
by
a
steep
path
intertwisting
through
almost
impossible
places
and
requiring
four
times
the
amount
of
physical
exertion
i
was
led
over
what
was
called
a
new
road
it
was
quite
impossible
to
horses
carrying
loads
and
only
by
tremendous
effort
could
i
climb
up
how
my
coolies
managed
it
remains
a
mystery
and
then
as
is
almost
inevitable
with
these
new
roads
and
the
short
cuts
they
invariably
lose
their
way
mine
did
hopeless
was
our
obscurity
unspeakable
our
confusion
men
kept
vanishing
and
among
the
rocks
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
fix
our
position
geographically
up
and
up
we
went
in
and
out
twisting
and
turning
in
an
endless
climb
a
gale
blew
but
at
times
we
pulled
ourselves
up
by
the
dried
grass
in
heat
after
several
hours
standing
on
the
very
summit
of
this
bleak
and
lofty
mountain
i
could
just
discern
and
far
away
down
in
the
mists
there
lay
the
ta
lu
also
like
a
piece
of
white
ribbon
stretched
across
black
velvet
the
white
road
on
the
burnt
we
were
opposite
the
highest
peaks
in
the
mountains
beyond
the
plain
far
towards
tengyueh
they
are
feet
we
were
at
least
feet
and
as
is
only
feet
our
hours
of
toil
may
be
imagined
when
we
reached
the
top
we
found
nothing
to
eat
nothing
to
drink
not
even
a
mountain
stream
at
which
we
could
moisten
our
parched
lips
simply
two
memorial
stones
on
the
graves
of
two
dead
men
who
had
merited
such
an
outrageous
i
donned
a
sweater
and
lay
flat
on
the
ground
exhausted

the

journalistic
scene
at

the
journey
which
i
was
about
to
undertake
was
the
most
memorable
of
my
travels
in
china
with
the
exception
of
those
in
the
unexplored
miao
lands
for
i
was
to
pass
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
the
dreaded
salwen
valley
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
stay
here
for
a
night
to
see
the
effects
of
the
climate
but
postponed
my
sojourn
intead
to
a
later
period
when
i
stayed
two
days
and
went
up
the
country
towards
the
source
of
the
river
i
am
so
far
as
i
know
the
only
european
who
has
ever
traveled
here
not
that
my
journeyings
will
convey
any
great
benefit
upon
anyone
but
myself
as
i
had
no
instruments
for
surveying
or
taking
accurate
levels
and
might
not
have
been
able
to
use
them
had
i
had
them
with
me
however
i
came
in
contact
with
and
saw
in
my
two
marches
a
good
deal
of
new
life
which
only
acts
as
an
incentive
to
see
more
my
plan
on
the
present
occasion
was
to
travel
onwards
by
the
following
stages

steamer
february
i
cross
the
same
river
many
hundreds
of
miles
from
where
it
empties
into
the
china
sea
i
cross
by
a
magnificent
suspension
bridge
a
cruel
road
almost
vertical
and
negotiated
by
a
twining
zigzag
path
has
brought
me
down
after
infinite
labor
from
the
mountains
over
feet
below
my
highest
point
reached
yesterday
and
i
now
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
bridge
gazing
at
the
silent
green
stream
flowing
between
cliffs
of
steepness
i
am
resting
for
i
have
to
climb
again
immediately
to
over
feet
this
bridge
has
a
wooden
base
swinging
on
iron
chains
and
is
connected
with
the
cliffs
by
bulwarks
of
solid
masonry
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
i
am
feet
above
the
mouth
of
the
river
to
my
left
as
i
look
down
the
torrent
there
are
and
a
temple
alongside
a
most
decorative
buttress
on
which
the
carving
is
elaborate
at
the
far
end
just
before
entering
the
miniature
tunnel
branching
out
to
a
paved
roadway
leading
upwards
my
coolies
are
sitting
in
truly
asiatic
style
admiring
huge
chinese
characters
hacked
into
the
side
of
the
natural
rock
descriptive
of
the
whole
business
and
under
a
sheltering
roof
are
also
two
memorial
tablets
in
gilt
my
patriotic
thermometer
has
risen
almost
to
and
in
admiring
the
work
of
the
ancients
they
feel
that
they
have
a
legitimate
excuse
for
a
long
delay
at
a
temple
called
we
drank
tea
and
prepared
ourselves
for
the
worst
climb
experienced
in
our
long
overland
tramp
the
mekong
is
at
this
point
just
feet
above
sea
level
as
has
been
said
the
point
in
front
of
us
running
up
perpendicularly
to
a
narrow
pass
in
the
mountains
leads
on
to
feet
and
on
again
to
itself
feet
high
the
mountains
on
which
it
occupies
a
ledge
being
much
higher
for
slipperiness
and
general
hazards
this
road
baffles
description
it
leads
up
step
by
step
but
not
regular
steps
not
even
as
regularity
goes
in
china
there
are
two
small
arched
bridges
in
the
journey
on
the
first
i
sit
down
and
gaze
far
away
down
to
the
shining
river
below
and
must
ascend
again
in
the
wake
of
my
panting
men
where
the
road
is
not
natural
rock
it
is
composed
of
huge
fragments
of
stone
in
the
rough
state
smooth
as
the
face
of
a
mirror
haphazardly
placed
at
such
dangerous
spots
as
to
show
that
no
idea
of
building
was
employed
when
the
road
was
made
sometimes
one
steps
twenty
inches
from
one
stone
to
another
and
were
it
not
that
the
pathway
is
winding
although
the
turning
and
twisting
makes
unending
toil
progress
in
the
ascent
would
be
impossible
mules
are
passing
me
puffing
panting
perspiring
poor
brutes
one
has
fallen
and
in
rolling
has
dragged
another
with
him
and
there
the
twain
lie
motionless
on
those
horrid
stones
while
the
exhausted
muleteers
raise
their
loads
to
allow
them
slowly
to
regain
their
feet
there
are
some
hundreds
of
them
now
on
the
hill
this
description
was
made
in
shorthand
notes
in
my
notebook
as
i
ascended
and
i
find
again
i
have
seen
one
or
two
places
in
like
this
but
the
danger
is
incomparably
less
and
the
road
infinitely
superior
we
pull
and
pant
and
puff
up
up
up
around
each
bend
and
my
men
can
scarce
go
forward
huge
pieces
of
rock
have
fallen
from
the
cliff
and
block
the
way
and
just
ahead
a
landslip
has
carried
off
part
of
our
course
the
road
is
indescribably
difficult
because
it
is
so
slippery
and
one
can
get
no
foothold
my
pony
carrying
nothing
but
the
little
flesh
which
bad
food
has
enabled
him
to
keep
has
been
down
on
his
knees
four
times
and
once
he
rolled
so
much
that
i
thought
that
he
must
surely
go
over
the
ravine
rocks
overhang
me
as
i
pass
if
one
should
drop
but
one
does
not
mind
the
toil
when
he
looks
upon
his
men
in
the
midst
of
their
intense
labor
my
men
squeals
of
songs
echo
through
the
mountains
as
the
perspiration
runs
down
their
uncovered
backs
they
chaff
each
other
and
utmost
good
feeling
prevails
poor
shanks
is
nearly
done
but
still
laughs
loudly
a
natural
pathway
more
difficult
of
progress
i
can
not
conceive
anywhere
in
the
world
and
yet
this
is
a
paved
road
the
road
over
which
all
the
trade
of
the
western
part
of
this
great
province
all
the
imports
from
burma
are
regularly
carried
should
the
road
ever
be
discarded
that
is
if
the
railway
ever
comes
over
this
route
only
a
long
tunnel
through
the
mountain
would
serve
its
purpose
we
have
just
sat
down
and
fraternized
with
the
man
carrying
the
mails
to
and
now
we
are
working
steadily
for
the
top
around
corners
where
the
breeze
comes
with
delicious
freshness
here
we
are
on
a
road
now
leading
through
a
widening
gorge
to
and
as
i
cross
the
narrow
pass
i
see
the
river
down
below
looking
like
a
snake
waiting
for
its
prey
roads
are
needed
far
more
than
railways
being
hungry
we
sat
down
at
to
feed
on
rice
at
a
place
where
a
man
minded
the
baby
while
the
woman
attended
to
the
food
over
my
head
hung
sausages
my
men
swore
that
they
were
sausages
although
for
my
life
i
could
see
no
resemblance
to
that
article
of
food
things
of
inches
in
circumference
and
from
to
inches
long
doubled
up
and
hung
up
for
sale
over
a
bamboo
to
dry
and
harden
in
the
sun
hams
there
were
and
dried
bacon
and
dirty
brown
biscuits
and
uninviting
pickled
cabbage
by
the
side
of
the
table
where
i
sat
was
a
wooden
pun
of
unwashed
rice
bowls
against
which
lay
the
filthy
domestic
dog
outside
the
narrow
street
was
lined
to
the
farthest
point
of
vantage
by
kindly
people
curious
to
see
their
own
feeding
implements
in
the
incapable
hands
of
the
barbarian
from
the
western
lands
and
the
conversation
waxed
loud
and
excited
in
general
hazards
regarding
my
presence
in
their
city
stenches
were
rife
they
nearly
choked
one
a
little
boy
yelled
out
to
his
mother
in
complaint
of
the
food
he
had
been
given
by
a
feminine
his
sister
the
mother
immediately
became
furious
beyond
all
control
she
snatched
a
bamboo
to
belabor
the
girl
and
in
chasing
her
knocked
over
the
pun
of
pots
aforesaid
the
place
became
a
bedlam
men
rose
from
their
seats
and
with
their
mouths
full
of
rice
expostulated
in
vainest
mediation
waving
their
chopsticks
in
the
air
and
whilst
the
mother
turned
upon
them
in
grossest
abuse
the
daughter
cleared
out
at
the
back
of
the
premises
i
left
the
irate
parent
brandishing
the
bamboo
her
voice
was
heard
beyond
the
town
but
i
was
not
allowed
to
leave
the
town
all
the
intellect
of
the
place
had
assembled
in
one
of
the
shops
into
which
i
was
gently
drawn
by
the
coat
sleeve
by
a
humpback
and
all
of
the
men
assembled
began
an
examination
as
to
who
the
dignitary
was
his
honorable
age
the
number
of
the
wives
sons
and
daughters
he
possessed
with
inevitable
questioning
into
the
concerns
of
his
patriarchal
forbears
accordingly
i
once
again
searched
the
archives
of
my
elastic
memory
and
there
found
all
information
readily
accessible
so
that
in
a
few
moments
by
the
aid
of
bailer
i
had
explained
that
i
was
a
stranger
within
their
gates
wafted
thither
by
circumstances
extraordinarily
auspicious
and
had
satisfied
them
concerning
my
parentage
birthplace
prospects
and
pursuits
with
introspective
anecdotal
references
to
various
deceased
members
of
my
family
tree
i
did
not
tell
them
the
truth
that
i
was
a
pilgrim
from
a
far
country
footsore
and
that
i
had
been
poisoned
by
their
bad
cooking
and
blistered
with
their
i
rose
to
go
like
automotons
everyone
in
the
company
rose
with
me
the
humpback
again
caught
me
this
time
by
both
hands
and
warmly
pressed
me
to
stay
and
uan
play
a
little
great
brother
he
ejaculated
why
journeyest
thou
wearisomely
towards
tarry
here
and
he
had
pushed
me
back
again
into
my
chair
he
had
my
teacup
and
invited
me
to
tell
more
tales
of
antiquarian
relationship
and
finally
i
was
allowed
to
go
greater
hospitality
could
not
have
been
shown
me
anywhere
in
the
world
the
day
had
been
hard
going
we
pursued
our
way
unheedingly
as
men
knowing
not
whither
we
went
and
at
fearing
that
we
should
not
be
able
to
make
where
we
intended
stopping
i
decided
to
go
no
farther
than
the
evening
was
one
of
the
happiest
i
spent
in
my
journeys
although
personal
comfort
was
entirely
lacking
the
place
is
made
up
of
just
a
few
hovels
people
were
hostile
and
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
my
men
entreaties
for
shelter
for
very
helplessness
i
laughed
aloud
i
screamed
with
laughter
and
the
folk
gathered
to
see
me
almost
in
hysterics
they
soon
began
to
smile
then
to
laugh
and
seeing
the
effect
i
laughed
still
louder
and
soon
had
the
whole
village
with
tears
of
laughter
making
furrows
down
their
unwashed
faces
laughing
as
a
pack
of
hyenas
at
last
a
kind
old
woman
gave
way
to
my
boy
persuasions
beckoning
us
to
follow
her
into
a
house
here
we
found
a
young
girl
of
about
nine
summers
in
charge
it
was
all
rare
fun
there
was
nothing
to
eat
and
so
the
men
went
one
here
and
another
there
buying
supplies
for
the
night
another
cleared
out
the
room
and
made
it
a
little
habitable
the
coolie
cooked
the
rice
shanks
boiled
eggs
and
cut
up
the
pork
into
small
slices
another
fed
the
pony
and
then
we
fed
ourselves
in
the
evening
a
wood
fire
was
kindled
in
the
corner
near
my
bed
and
we
all
sat
round
on
the
mud
floor
stools
there
were
none
to
tell
yarns
my
confederates
were
out
for
a
spree
we
smoked
and
drank
tea
and
yarned
suddenly
a
stick
would
be
thrust
over
my
shoulder
to
the
fire
it
was
merely
a
man
pipe
going
to
the
fire
for
a
light
chinese
never
use
matches
it
is
a
waste
when
there
are
so
many
fires
about
if
on
the
road
a
man
wants
to
light
his
pipe
he
walks
into
a
home
and
gets
it
from
the
fire
no
one
minds
no
notice
is
taken
of
the
intrusion
everybody
is
polite
and
the
man
may
not
utter
a
word
at
a
wayside
a
man
may
go
behind
to
where
the
cooking
is
being
conducted
poke
his
pipe
into
the
embers
and
walk
out
pulling
at
it
all
as
naturally
as
if
that
man
were
in
his
own
house
an
englishman
would
have
a
rough
time
of
it
if
he
had
to
go
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
pull
away
at
a
pipe
from
a
fire
on
the
floor
no
father
no
mother
no
elder
brother
had
the
little
girl
in
charge
she
was
left
without
friends
entirely
and
a
man
must
have
been
a
hard
man
indeed
were
he
to
steel
his
heart
against
such
a
helpless
little
one
i
called
her
to
me
gave
her
a
little
present
and
comforted
her
as
she
cried
for
the
very
knowledge
that
an
englishman
would
do
a
kind
act
to
a
little
waif
such
as
herself
she
was
in
the
act
of
giving
back
the
money
to
me
when
lao
chang
with
pleasant
aptitude
interposed
explained
that
foreigners
occasionally
develop
generous
moods
and
that
she
had
better
stop
crying
and
lock
the
money
away
she
did
this
but
the
poor
little
mite
nearly
broke
her
heart
which
we
reached
early
the
next
morning
is
a
considerable
town
where
most
of
the
people
earn
their
livelihood
at
dyeing
those
who
do
not
dye
drink
tea
and
pass
rude
remarks
about
itinerant
magnates
such
as
the
author
i
passed
over
the
once
fine
bridge
at
the
end
of
the
town
in
the
evening
we
are
at
here
i
saw
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
a
man
carrying
a
and
a
horrible
sickening
feeling
seized
me
as
i
tramped
through
the
street
and
watched
the
poor
fellow
the
mob
were
evidently
clamoring
for
his
death
and
were
prepared
to
make
sport
of
his
torments
there
is
nothing
more
glorious
to
a
brutal
populace
than
the
physical
agony
of
a
helpless
nothing
which
produces
more
mirth
than
the
despair
the
pain
the
writhing
of
a
miserable
condemned
wretch
great
drops
of
sweat
bathed
his
brow
and
as
one
looked
on
one
felt
that
he
might
pray
that
his
hot
and
throbbing
blood
might
rush
in
merciful
full
force
to
a
vital
center
of
his
brain
so
that
he
might
fall
into
oblivion
the
jeers
and
the
mockery
of
a
pitiless
multitude
seemed
too
awful
no
matter
what
the
man
crime
had
been
feet
is
as
well
known
as
any
city
in
far
western
china
i
stayed
here
for
two
days
rest
the
only
disturbing
element
being
a
wretch
of
a
who
made
unbearable
the
life
of
her
son
wife
a
girl
of
about
eighteen
who
has
probably
by
this
time
taken
opium
if
she
has
been
able
to
get
hold
of
it
and
so
ended
a
miserable
existence
on
a
return
visit
this
as
soon
as
she
caught
sight
of
me
ran
to
fetch
an
empty
tin
a
small
black
safety
pin
and
two
inches
of
lead
pencil
i
had
left
behind
me
on
the
previous
visit
i
have
made
more
than
one
visit
to
and
the
people
have
always
treated
me
well
along
the
ten
li
of
level
plain
from
the
city
on
the
road
which
led
up
again
to
the
mountains
i
less
than
bullocks
laden
with
nothing
but
firewood
and
mules
and
ponies
carrying
cotton
yarn
and
other
general
imports
coming
from
burma
there
was
a
stampede
at
the
foot
of
the
town
and
quite
against
my
own
will
i
assure
the
reader
i
got
mixed
up
in
the
affair
as
i
stood
watching
the
light
and
shade
effects
of
the
morning
sun
on
the
buffaloes
with
a
crude
hoop
collar
of
wood
around
their
coarse
necks
dragged
planks
along
the
roadway
the
timber
swerving
dangerously
from
side
to
side
as
the
heavy
animals
pursued
their
painful
plodding
to
the
chinese
the
buffalo
is
the
safest
of
all
quadrupeds
if
we
perhaps
except
the
mule
which
if
three
legs
give
way
will
save
himself
on
the
remaining
one
but
it
is
certainly
the
slowest
i
am
here
reminded
that
when
i
was
starting
on
this
trip
a
journalistic
friend
of
mine
who
had
spent
some
years
in
one
of
the
coast
ports
tried
to
dissuade
me
from
coming
and
cited
the
buffalo
as
the
most
treacherous
animal
to
be
met
on
the
main
road
in
china
he
put
it
in
this
way
well
old
man
you
have
evidently
made
up
your
mind
but
i
would
not
take
it
on
at
any
price
the
buffaloes
are
terrors
they
smell
you
even
if
they
do
not
see
you
they
smell
you
miles
off
it
may
end
up
by
your
being
chased
and
you
will
probably
be
gored
to
death
the
buffalo
is
the
most
peaceful
animal
i
know
in
china
miniature
belfries
were
attached
to
the
wooden
frames
on
the
backs
of
carrying
oxen
and
were
it
not
for
the
huge
tenor
bell
and
its
sound
keeping
the
animal
in
motion
the
slow
pace
would
be
slower
still
turning
suddenly
and
abruptly
to
the
left
we
commenced
a
cold
journey
over
the
mountains
although
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
a
goitrous
man
came
to
me
and
waxed
eloquent
about
some
uncontrollable
pig
which
was
dragging
him
all
over
the
roadway
as
he
vainly
tried
to
get
it
to
market
some
dozen
small
boys
with
hatchets
and
scythes
over
their
shoulders
for
the
cutting
of
firewood
they
were
looking
for
laughed
at
me
as
i
ploughed
through
the
mud
in
my
sandals
we
had
been
going
for
three
hours
and
when
cold
and
damp
we
got
inside
a
cottage
for
tea
i
found
that
we
had
covered
only
twenty
li
so
we
were
told
by
an
old
fogey
who
brushed
up
the
floor
with
a
piece
of
bamboo
he
was
dressed
in
what
might
have
been
termed
undress
and
was
most
vigorous
in
his
condemnation
of
foreigners
we
passed
at
li
out
and
just
beyond
the
aneroid
registered
feet
plain
is
feet
feet
the
range
of
hills
dividing
the
two
plains
was
bare
the
clouds
hung
low
and
the
keen
wind
whistled
in
our
faces
and
nipped
our
ears
ten
li
from
on
a
barren
upland
overlooking
the
valley
a
mere
boy
had
established
himself
as
tea
provider
for
the
traveler
a
foreign
kerosene
tin
placed
on
three
stones
was
the
general
cistern
for
boiling
water
which
was
dipped
out
and
handed
round
in
a
slip
of
bamboo
shaped
like
a
mug
with
a
stick
to
hold
it
by
farther
on
grew
in
a
field
to
the
left
and
near
by
a
man
sat
on
his
haunches
on
the
ground
feeding
a
machine
propelled
by
a
buffalo
who
patiently
tramped
round
that
small
circle
all
day
and
every
day
turning
from
this
i
beheld
one
of
the
worst
sights
i
have
ever
seen
in
china
seven
dogs
were
dragging
a
corpse
from
a
coffin
barely
covered
with
earth
which
formed
one
of
the
grave
mounds
which
skirt
the
road
no
one
was
disturbed
by
the
scene
it
was
not
uncommon
but
the
foreigner
suffered
an
agonizing
sickness
for
which
his
companions
would
have
been
at
a
loss
to
find
any
possible
reason
and
was
relieved
to
reach
market
was
at
its
height
it
was
warm
down
here
in
the
valley
the
streets
were
packed
with
people
many
of
whom
were
pushed
bodily
into
the
piles
of
common
foreign
and
native
merchandise
on
sale
on
either
side
of
the
road
a
clodhopper
of
a
fellow
jostled
by
my
escort
fell
into
a
stall
and
broke
the
huge
umbrella
which
formed
a
shelter
for
the
vendor
and
his
goods
and
my
boy
was
called
upon
to
pay
fifty
cash
fixed
the
matter
i
walked
into
a
crowded
inn
and
made
majestically
for
the
extreme
corner
everybody
wondered
and
softly
asked
his
neighbor
what
in
the
sacred
name
of
confucius
had
come
upon
them
see
his
boots
look
at
his
old
hat
what
a
face
it
a
monstrosity
and
but
as
i
sat
down
the
general
of
the
establishment
cruelly
forced
back
the
people
and
screamingly
yelled
at
the
top
of
his
voice
that
those
who
wanted
to
drink
tea
in
the
room
must
pay
double
rates
his
unusual
announcement
was
received
with
a
low
grunt
of
dissatisfaction
but
no
one
left
every
table
in
the
square
apartment
was
soon
filled
with
six
or
eight
men
and
the
noise
was
terrific
curiosity
increased
the
fun
was
as
the
comic
papers
say
fast
and
furious
and
despite
the
pleasantries
passed
by
my
own
men
and
the
inquisitive
to
peculiarities
of
heredity
in
certain
noisy
members
of
the
crowd
a
riot
seemed
inevitable
i
stationed
my
two
soldiers
in
the
narrow
doorway
to
defend
the
only
entrance
and
entertain
the
uninitiated
with
stories
of
their
prowess
with
the
rifle
and
of
the
weapon
deadliness
boys
climbed
like
monkeys
to
the
overhead
beams
to
get
a
glimpse
of
me
as
i
fed
and
incidentally
shook
dust
into
my
food
everyone
pushed
to
where
there
was
standing
room
outside
a
rolling
sea
of
yellow
faces
surmounted
a
mass
of
lively
blue
cotton
all
eager
for
a
look
the
din
was
terrible
all
very
visibly
annoyed
were
my
men
at
the
rudeness
of
their
fellow
countrymen
and
especially
surprised
at
the
equanimity
of
ding
daren
in
tolerating
quietly
their
pointed
and
personal
remarks
i
became
more
and
more
the
hero
of
the
hour
turning
to
the
crowd
as
i
came
out
i
smiled
serenely
and
with
a
quiet
wave
of
the
hand
pointed
out
in
faultless
english
that
the
gulf
between
my
own
country
and
theirs
was
already
wide
enough
and
that
great
britain
might
did
not
say
that
she
but
might
widen
it
still
more
if
they
persisted
in
treating
her
subjects
in
china
as
monstrous
specimens
of
the
human
race
this
was
rigorously
corroborated
by
my
two
to
whom
i
appealed
and
a
parting
word
on
the
ordinary
politeness
of
western
nations
to
a
greasy
fellow
he
was
a
worker
in
brass
who
felt
my
clothes
with
his
dirty
fingers
ended
an
interesting
break
in
the
day
monotony
in
the
street
the
crowd
again
was
at
my
heels
and
evinced
more
than
comfortable
curiosity
in
my
straw
sandals
they
cost
me
thirty
cash
equal
to
about
a
halfpenny
in
our
coinage
since
then
i
have
paid
other
visits
to
on
one
occasion
in
subsequent
travel
i
had
a
public
shave
there
my
arrival
at
the
inn
in
the
nick
of
time
enabled
me
to
buttonhole
the
barber
who
was
picking
up
his
traps
to
clear
and
i
had
one
of
the
best
shaves
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
in
one
of
the
most
uncomfortable
positions
i
ever
remember
my
seat
was
a
low
narrow
form
with
no
back
or
anything
for
my
neck
to
rest
upon
and
afterwards
i
went
through
the
primitive
and
painful
massage
process
of
being
bumped
all
over
the
back
between
every
four
or
five
whacks
the
barber
snapped
his
fingers
and
clapped
his
hands
and
right
glad
was
i
when
he
had
finished
the
yard
was
full
even
to
the
stable
and
alongside
each
other
the
anger
of
a
grizzly
old
dame
who
smoked
a
reeking
pipe
and
who
had
charge
of
the
depot
being
eclipsed
only
by
my
infuriated
barber
as
he
gave
cruel
vent
to
his
anger
upon
my
aching
back
this
reminds
me
of
an
uncomfortable
shave
i
had
some
ten
years
ago
in
trinidad
where
a
black
man
sat
me
on
the
trunk
of
a
tree
whilst
he
got
behind
and
rested
my
head
on
one
knee
and
got
to
work
with
an
implement
which
might
have
made
a
decent
putty
knife
but
was
never
meant
to
cut
whiskers
however
in
the
case
of
the
chinese
his
knife
was
in
fair
condition
but
he
grunted
a
good
deal
over
my
growth
this
little
story
should
not
convey
the
impression
that
i
am
an
advocate
of
the
public
shave
in
china
or
anywhere
else
but
there
are
times
when
one
is
glad
of
it
i
have
been
shaved
by
chinese
in
many
places
and
whilst
resident
at
with
a
broken
arm
a
man
came
regularly
to
me
his
shave
sometimes
being
delightful
and
sometimes
not
i
had
another
rather
amusing
experience
at
about
a
month
after
this
a
supplementary
coolie
had
been
engaged
for
me
at
tengyueh
at
a
somewhat
bigger
wage
than
my
other
men
were
getting
and
this
known
of
course
to
them
added
to
the
fact
that
he
was
not
carrying
the
heaviest
load
did
not
tend
to
produce
unmarred
brotherhood
among
them
the
man
had
been
told
that
he
would
go
on
to
with
me
on
my
return
trip
so
that
when
i
took
the
part
of
my
men
who
had
come
many
hundreds
of
miles
with
me
and
who
had
engaged
another
man
on
the
route
to
fill
the
gap
in
desiring
to
get
rid
of
him
he
certainly
had
some
right
on
his
side
the
day
before
we
reached
he
was
told
that
at
that
place
he
would
not
be
required
any
longer
but
he
decided
then
and
there
to
go
no
farther
and
refused
to
carry
when
we
were
ready
to
start
i
should
have
recompensed
him
fully
however
for
his
disappointment
had
he
not
made
some
detestable
reference
to
my
mother
in
what
lao
chang
assured
me
was
not
strictly
parliamentary
language
as
soon
as
i
learnt
this
i
was
standing
near
the
fellow
he
somehow
fell
over
sprawling
to
the
floor
over
my
walnut
folding
chair
which
snapped
at
the
arm
it
was
my
doing
the
man
said
no
more
picked
up
his
loads
and
was
the
first
to
arrive
at
so
that
a
little
force
was
not
ineffective
indiscriminate
use
of
force
i
do
not
advocate
however
i
believe
in
the
reverse
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
rarely
hit
a
man
but
there
have
been
occasions
when
a
man
having
refused
to
do
what
he
has
engaged
to
do
or
in
cases
of
downright
insolence
a
little
push
or
a
slight
cut
with
my
stick
has
brought
about
a
capital
feeling
and
gained
for
me
immediate
respect
off
the
main
road
was
our
travelers
rarely
take
this
road
gill
took
it
i
believe
but
baber
davies
and
other
took
the
main
road
this
short
road
was
more
fatiguing
than
the
main
road
would
have
been
we
again
turned
a
upside
down
people
did
not
at
first
wish
to
take
me
in
so
i
pushed
past
the
quarrelsome
man
in
the
doorway
took
possession
and
set
to
work
to
get
what
i
wanted
soon
the
people
calmed
down
and
gave
all
they
could
my
bed
i
spread
near
the
door
and
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
me
as
i
lay
resting
the
inhabitants
in
much
the
same
manner
as
people
at
home
visit
and
revisit
the
cage
of
tigers
at
a
menagerie
assembled
and
reassembled
with
considerable
confusion
but
i
was
beneath
my
curtains
so
they
came
again
and
when
i
ate
my
food
by
candlelight
many
human
and
tangible
products
of
the
past
glared
in
at
the
doorway
after
dark
we
all
foregathered
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
round
the
camp
fire
the
conversation
taking
a
pleasant
turn
from
ordinary
things
such
as
the
varying
distances
from
place
to
place
how
many
basins
of
rice
each
man
could
eat
and
other
chinese
commonplaces
to
things
military
everybody
warmed
to
the
subject
my
military
bodyguard
were
the
chief
speakers
and
cleverly
brought
round
the
smoky
fire
for
the
benefit
of
the
rustics
who
made
up
the
fascinated
audience
a
modern
battlefield
and
made
their
description
horrible
enough
one
carefully
brought
out
his
gun
waving
it
overhead
to
add
to
the
tragedy
as
he
weaved
a
powerful
story
of
shell
splinters
trenches
common
shot
men
and
horses
out
of
which
all
life
and
virtue
had
been
blown
by
gunpowder
the
picture
was
drawn
around
the
chinese
village
and
in
the
dim
glimmer
each
man
thought
ran
swiftly
to
his
own
homestead
and
the
green
fields
and
the
hedgerows
and
dwellings
all
blown
to
atoms
left
merely
as
a
place
of
skulls
they
spoke
of
great
and
horrible
implements
of
modern
warfare
invented
to
their
minds
by
the
devilry
of
the
west
each
man
chipped
in
with
a
little
color
and
the
company
broke
up
in
fear
of
dreaming
of
the
things
of
which
they
had
heard
afraid
to
go
to
their
straw
to
sleep
as
i
lay
in
my
draughty
corner
my
own
mind
turned
to
what
the
next
day
would
bring
for
i
was
to
go
down
to
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
the
dreaded
salwen
i
had
read
of
it
as
a
veritable
chapter
xxiii
from
feet
to
meet
for
the
first
of
the
salwen
valley
reports
get
into
of
the
climb
from
feet
to
over
in
the
quintet
of
men
fall
to
the
ground
fatiguing
in
the
the
night
in
a
drink
as
it
affects
the
attentions
of
a
kindly
year
festivities
at
shweli
river
and
range
of
at
no
chinese
i
knew
lived
in
the
valley
but
i
had
yet
to
learn
that
so
soon
as
the
country
drops
to
say
less
than
feet
the
chinese
consider
it
too
unhealthy
a
spot
for
him
to
pass
his
days
in
the
reason
why
shans
control
the
valley
is
therefore
not
hard
to
find
and
owing
to
the
probability
that
what
european
travelers
have
written
about
the
unhealthiness
of
this
salwen
valley
has
been
based
on
information
obtained
from
chinese
its
bad
name
may
be
easily
accounted
for
the
next
morning
as
i
descended
i
saw
much
malarial
mist
rising
but
after
having
on
a
subsequent
visit
spent
two
days
and
two
nights
at
the
lowest
point
i
am
in
a
position
to
say
that
conditions
have
been
very
much
exaggerated
and
that
places
quite
as
unhealthy
are
to
be
found
between
the
town
at
the
foot
by
the
bridge
and
the
shan
states
leading
on
to
burma
a
good
deal
of
the
country
to
the
north
of
the
province
towards
the
tibetan
border
is
so
and
so
cold
that
the
chinese
is
afraid
to
live
there
and
the
fact
that
in
the
shan
states
so
and
sultry
he
is
so
readily
liable
to
fever
prevents
him
from
living
there
these
places
through
reports
coming
from
the
chinese
are
as
a
matter
of
course
dubbed
as
unhealthy
the
average
inhabitant
that
is
chinese
strikes
a
medium
between
feet
and
feet
to
live
in
and
avoids
going
into
lower
country
between
march
and
november
if
he
can
to
pass
the
valley
and
go
to
feet
passing
the
highest
point
at
nearly
feet
li
distant
from
was
our
ambition
for
the
day
starting
in
the
early
morning
i
had
a
pleasant
walk
over
an
even
road
leading
to
a
narrowing
gorge
through
which
a
road
led
to
the
valley
beyond
two
and
a
half
hours
it
took
me
in
my
foreign
boots
to
cover
the
twenty
li
i
fell
five
times
over
the
smooth
stones
the
country
was
bare
desolate
lonely
four
people
only
were
met
over
the
entire
distance
but
in
the
dreaded
valley
several
trees
were
ablaze
with
blossom
and
oranges
shone
like
small
balls
of
gold
in
the
rising
sun
children
playing
in
between
the
trees
ran
away
and
hid
as
they
saw
me
although
i
was
fifty
yards
from
them
they
did
not
know
what
it
was
and
they
had
never
seen
one
farther
down
i
caught
up
my
men
lao
chang
and
shanks
and
pleasant
speculations
were
entered
into
as
to
what
singai
bhamo
was
like
they
were
particularly
interested
in
singapore
because
i
had
lived
there
and
after
i
had
given
them
a
general
description
of
the
place
and
explained
how
the
chinese
had
gone
ahead
there
i
pointed
out
as
well
as
i
could
with
my
limited
vocabulary
that
if
the
people
of
only
had
a
conscience
and
would
only
get
out
of
the
rut
of
the
ages
they
too
might
go
ahead
explaining
incidentally
to
them
that
as
lights
of
the
church
at
it
was
their
sacred
duty
to
raise
the
standard
of
moral
living
among
their
countrymen
wherever
they
might
wander
their
general
acquiescence
was
astounding
and
in
the
next
town
these
two
men
put
their
theory
into
practice
and
almost
caused
a
riot
by
offering
cash
for
a
fowl
for
which
the
vendor
blandly
asked
but
they
got
the
chicken
and
at
their
own
price
too
as
i
was
thus
gently
in
soliloquy
i
first
heard
and
then
caught
sight
of
the
river
below
the
unnavigable
salwen
feet
lower
than
either
the
mekong
or
the
shweli
which
we
were
to
cross
two
days
later
it
is
a
pity
the
salwen
was
not
preserved
as
the
boundary
between
burma
and
china
gradually
as
we
approached
the
steep
stone
steps
leading
down
thereto
i
saw
one
of
the
cleverest
pieces
of
native
engineering
in
asia
the
double
suspension
bridge
which
here
spans
the
salwen
the
only
one
i
had
seen
in
my
trip
across
the
empire
the
first
span
some
feet
by
feet
reaches
from
the
natural
rock
down
which
a
vertical
path
zigzags
to
the
foot
and
the
second
span
then
runs
over
to
the
busy
little
town
of
here
then
were
we
in
the
most
dreaded
spot
in
western
china
if
you
stay
a
night
in
this
valley
rumor
says
you
go
to
bed
for
the
last
time
chinese
are
afraid
of
it
europeans
dare
not
linger
in
it
malaria
stalks
abroad
for
her
victims
and
snatches
everyone
who
dallies
in
his
journey
to
the
topside
mountain
village
of
the
river
is
feet
above
the
sea
is
nearly
feet
it
was
ten
as
i
pulled
over
my
stool
and
took
tea
in
the
crowded
shop
at
i
saw
shans
here
for
the
first
time
the
village
now
however
is
anything
but
a
shan
village
of
the
people
in
the
immediate
vicinity
i
counted
only
ten
typical
shans
and
of
the
company
around
me
in
this
popular
out
of
were
chinese
including
ten
mohammedans
it
was
however
easy
to
see
that
several
of
these
were
of
shan
extraction
who
although
they
had
features
distinctly
had
adopted
the
chinese
language
and
custom
a
party
of
tibetans
were
here
in
the
charge
of
a
lama
in
an
inner
court
and
scampered
off
as
i
rose
to
snap
their
photographs
this
was
a
very
low
altitude
for
tibetans
to
reach
whilst
i
sipped
my
tea
the
local
horse
dealer
wanted
so
very
much
to
sell
me
a
pony
cheap
he
offered
it
for
forty
taels
i
offered
him
five
it
was
gone
in
the
back
was
blind
in
the
left
eye
and
was
at
least
seventeen
years
old
the
man
smiled
as
i
refused
to
buy
and
told
me
that
my
knowledge
of
was
wonderful
the
road
then
led
up
to
a
plain
where
paths
branched
in
many
directions
to
the
hills
men
either
going
to
the
market
or
coming
from
it
leaned
on
their
loads
to
rest
under
enormous
banyans
and
to
watch
me
as
i
passed
horses
browsed
on
the
one
of
my
soldiers
had
laid
in
provisions
for
the
day
and
ran
along
with
his
gun
muzzle
forward
over
one
shoulder
and
four
lengths
of
over
the
other
ploughmen
with
their
buffaloes
halted
in
the
muddy
fields
to
gaze
admiringly
upon
me
women
ran
scared
from
the
path
when
my
pony
let
out
at
a
casual
who
tickled
him
with
a
thin
bamboo
maidenhair
ferns
grew
in
great
profusion
showing
that
we
were
getting
into
warmer
climate
streams
rushed
swiftly
under
the
stone
roadway
from
dams
to
facilitate
the
irrigation
at
which
the
chinese
are
such
all
was
smiling
and
warm
and
bright
dispelling
in
one
mind
all
sense
of
gloom
and
breeding
an
optimistic
outlook
we
were
now
a
party
of
nine
my
own
three
men
an
extra
coolie
i
had
engaged
to
rush
tengyueh
in
three
days
from
four
soldiers
and
the
paymaster
of
the
crowd
we
still
had
ninety
li
to
cover
so
that
when
we
left
the
shade
of
two
immense
trees
which
sheltered
me
and
my
perspiring
men
one
of
the
soldiers
agreed
that
everyone
had
to
clear
from
our
path
we
brooked
no
interception
until
we
reached
the
entrance
to
the
climb
where
i
met
two
europeans
of
the
customs
staff
at
tengyueh
who
had
come
down
here
to
camp
out
for
the
chinese
new
year
holiday
i
knew
that
these
men
were
not
englishmen
i
was
so
thirsty
and
the
best
they
could
do
was
to
keep
a
man
talking
in
the
sun
outside
their
tent
how
i
have
done
with
a
drink
a
tributary
of
the
salwen
flows
down
the
ravine
too
terrible
a
climb
to
the
top
was
it
for
me
to
take
notes
i
got
too
tired
everything
was
magnificently
green
and
nature
reproduction
seemed
to
be
going
on
whilst
one
gazed
upon
her
but
the
natural
glories
of
this
beautiful
gorge
with
a
dainty
touch
of
the
tropical
mingling
with
the
mighty
aspect
of
jungle
forest
with
glistening
cascades
and
rippling
streams
where
all
was
bountiful
and
exquisitely
beautiful
failed
to
hold
one
spellbound
for
since
i
had
left
i
had
rarely
been
out
of
sight
of
some
of
the
best
scenery
on
earth
yet
vegetation
was
very
different
to
that
which
we
had
been
passing
there
were
now
banyans
palms
plantains
and
many
ferns
trees
and
shrubs
and
other
products
of
warmer
climates
which
one
found
in
burma
what
impressed
me
farther
up
was
the
marvelous
growth
of
bamboos
some
rising
feet
and
feet
at
the
bend
in
their
various
tints
of
green
looking
like
delicate
feathers
against
the
haze
of
the
upon
which
houses
built
of
bamboo
from
floor
to
roof
seemed
temporarily
perched
whilst
others
seemed
to
be
tumbling
down
into
the
valley
this
spot
was
the
nearest
approach
to
real
jungle
i
had
seen
in
china
but
whilst
we
were
climbing
laboriously
through
this
country
over
opposite
it
seemed
no
more
than
a
stone
throw
the
hills
were
almost
bare
save
for
the
isolated
cultivation
of
the
peasantry
at
the
base
but
then
came
a
division
appearing
suddenly
to
view
farther
along
around
a
bend
and
i
saw
a
continuation
of
the
range
rising
even
higher
and
with
a
tree
growth
even
more
magnificent
denser
and
darker
still
here
i
came
upon
a
party
of
soldiers
with
foreign
military
peak
caps
on
their
heads
which
they
wore
outside
over
their
chinese
caps
in
fact
the
only
two
other
garments
besides
these
chinese
caps
were
the
distinguishing
marks
of
the
military
coats
they
had
but
they
had
been
discarded
at
the
foot
of
the
climb
rolled
into
one
bundle
and
tied
together
with
a
piece
of
ribbon
generally
worn
by
the
carrier
to
keep
his
trousers
tight
we
were
now
in
summer
heat
and
this
military
quintet
made
a
peculiar
sight
in
dusty
trousers
peak
caps
and
straw
sandals
with
the
perspiration
streaming
freely
down
their
naked
backs
as
they
plodded
upwards
under
a
pitiless
sun
thus
were
they
clad
when
i
met
them
but
catching
sight
of
my
distinguished
person
mistaking
me
for
a
gwan
they
immediately
made
a
rush
for
the
man
carrying
the
tunics
to
clothe
themselves
for
my
presence
with
seemly
respectability
but
a
word
from
my
boy
put
their
minds
at
rest
my
own
military
were
far
in
the
rear
a
couple
of
them
then
came
forward
to
me
sniggeringly
satisfied
that
they
were
not
to
be
reported
to
peking
or
wherever
their
may
have
his
residence
they
probably
had
no
more
idea
than
i
had
by
the
side
of
a
roaring
waterfall
in
a
spot
which
looked
a
very
fairyland
in
surroundings
of
reproductive
green
we
all
sat
down
to
rest
the
air
was
cool
and
the
path
was
damp
and
water
tumbling
everywhere
down
from
the
rocks
formed
pretty
cascades
and
rivulets
we
heard
the
clang
of
the
hatchets
and
soon
came
upon
men
felling
timber
and
sawing
up
trees
into
coffin
boards
we
were
in
the
valley
of
the
shadow
and
it
was
the
finest
coffin
center
of
the
district
i
took
my
boots
off
to
wade
through
water
which
overran
the
pathway
and
just
beyond
my
men
exhausted
with
their
awful
toil
lay
flat
on
their
backs
to
rest
they
were
dead
beat
one
pointed
up
to
the
perpendicular
cliff
momentarily
closed
his
eyes
and
looked
at
me
in
disgust
i
gently
remonstrated
it
was
not
my
country
i
told
him
it
was
the
emperor
and
after
a
time
we
reached
the
top
shadows
were
lengthening
in
the
distance
we
saw
the
mountains
upon
which
we
had
spent
the
previous
night
whose
tops
were
gilded
by
the
setting
sun
down
below
all
was
already
dark
a
cold
wind
blew
the
trees
bending
wearily
towards
the
valley
and
still
we
plodded
on
we
had
come
to
li
instead
of
the
i
had
been
led
to
believe
my
men
would
cover
every
room
in
the
hut
was
full
we
were
told
but
the
next
place
with
some
unpronounceable
name
fifteen
li
farther
down
would
give
us
good
housing
for
the
night
lao
chang
and
i
resolved
to
go
on
tired
though
we
were
before
i
resolved
on
this
plan
i
stopped
to
take
a
careful
survey
of
the
exact
situation
of
the
sheltering
hollow
in
which
we
meant
to
pass
the
night
the
sun
was
fast
sinking
the
dust
of
the
road
lay
grey
and
thick
about
my
feet
above
me
the
heavens
were
reddening
in
sunset
glory
the
landscape
had
no
touch
of
human
life
about
it
save
our
own
two
solitary
figures
and
the
place
fifteen
li
away
lay
before
me
as
a
dream
of
a
good
night
rather
than
a
reality
then
on
again
we
plodded
and
yelled
our
intentions
to
the
men
behind
from
the
brow
of
the
hill
we
descended
with
extreme
rapidity
down
down
into
a
valley
which
sent
up
a
damp
oppressive
atmosphere
through
the
trees
i
could
see
one
lovely
ball
of
deep
rich
red
painting
the
earth
as
it
sank
in
a
beauty
exquisite
beyond
all
else
four
men
met
us
stared
suspiciously
thought
we
were
deaf
and
yelled
that
the
place
was
twenty
li
away
and
that
we
had
better
return
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
but
we
left
them
and
went
still
farther
down
in
the
hush
that
prevailed
i
was
unaccountably
startled
to
see
the
form
of
a
woman
gliding
towards
me
in
the
twilight
she
came
out
of
the
valley
carrying
firewood
she
spoke
kindly
to
my
man
and
invited
me
to
spend
the
night
in
her
house
near
by
i
was
for
the
moment
vaguely
awed
by
her
very
quiescence
and
gazed
wondering
doubting
bewildered
what
was
the
little
trick
could
i
not
from
such
things
get
free
even
in
inland
china
the
red
light
of
the
sunken
sun
playing
round
her
comely
figure
dazzled
me
it
is
admitted
and
i
followed
her
with
a
sigh
of
mingled
dread
and
desire
for
rest
shall
i
say
the
shadow
of
the
smile
upon
her
lips
deepened
and
softened
with
an
infinite
compassion
dogs
rounded
upon
me
as
i
entered
the
bamboo
hut
stuck
on
the
side
of
the
hill
they
knew
i
had
no
right
there
inside
a
man
was
nursing
a
squalling
baby
our
escort
was
its
mother
the
man
her
husband
so
i
was
safe
the
place
was
swept
up
unnecessary
gear
was
taken
away
fire
was
kindled
tea
was
brewed
rice
was
prepared
and
whilst
in
shaving
for
we
were
to
reach
tengyueh
on
the
morrow
i
dodged
here
and
there
to
escape
the
smoke
and
get
the
most
light
giving
my
hospitable
host
a
good
deal
of
fun
in
so
doing
every
possible
preparation
was
made
for
my
comfort
and
convenience
by
the
untiring
woman
at
whose
invitation
i
was
there
their
attentions
embarrassed
me
every
movement
every
look
every
gesture
every
wish
was
anticipated
so
that
i
had
no
more
discomfort
than
a
roaring
wind
and
a
low
temperature
about
the
region
which
no
one
could
help
it
was
bitterly
cold
in
front
of
the
fire
i
sat
in
an
overcoat
among
the
crowd
drinking
tea
whilst
the
soldiers
drank
wine
they
bought
five
cash
worth
had
my
lamp
oil
run
out
i
should
have
bought
liquor
and
tried
to
burn
it
instead
soon
the
spirit
began
to
talk
and
these
braves
of
the
chinese
army
got
on
terms
of
freest
familiarity
telling
me
what
an
excellent
fellow
i
was
and
how
pleased
they
were
that
i
had
to
suffer
as
well
as
they
but
they
never
forgot
themselves
and
i
allowed
them
to
wander
on
uncontradicted
and
unrestrained
after
a
weary
night
of
tossing
in
my
with
a
roaring
gale
blowing
through
the
latticed
bamboo
behind
which
i
lay
so
poorly
sheltered
we
started
in
good
spirits
li
farther
we
reached
feet
february
new
year
morning
nothing
could
be
bought
everywhere
the
people
said
puh
mai
puh
mai
and
although
we
had
traveled
the
li
over
a
terrible
road
with
a
fearful
gradient
at
the
end
we
could
not
get
anyone
to
make
tea
for
us
it
is
distinctly
against
the
chinese
custom
to
sell
anything
at
new
year
time
of
course
we
had
to
boil
our
own
water
and
make
our
own
tea
a
larger
crowd
than
usual
gathered
around
me
because
of
the
general
holiday
and
as
i
write
now
i
am
seated
in
my
with
all
the
reprobates
near
to
me
men
gazing
emptily
women
who
have
rushed
from
their
houses
combing
their
hair
and
nursing
their
babies
the
beggars
with
their
poles
and
bowls
numberless
urchins
all
and
curious
these
are
kept
from
crowding
over
me
by
the
two
soldiers
who
the
day
before
had
come
on
ahead
to
book
rooms
in
the
place
i
stayed
at
on
another
occasion
then
i
found
a
good
room
but
later
learned
that
it
was
a
horse
inn
the
yard
of
which
was
taken
up
by
pack
animals
with
their
loads
pegs
were
as
usual
driven
into
the
ground
in
parallel
rows
a
pair
of
ponies
being
tied
to
each
not
by
the
head
but
by
the
feet
a
length
of
rope
being
attached
to
the
off
foreleg
of
one
and
the
near
foreleg
of
the
other
the
animals
facing
each
other
in
rows
and
eating
from
a
common
supply
in
the
center
everyone
in
the
small
town
was
busy
doing
and
driving
very
anxious
that
i
should
be
made
comfortable
which
might
have
been
the
case
but
for
some
untiring
musician
who
was
traveling
with
the
caravan
and
seemed
to
be
one
of
that
species
of
humankind
who
never
sleeps
his
notes
however
were
fairly
in
harmony
but
when
it
runs
on
to
and
one
knows
that
he
has
to
be
again
on
the
move
by
five
even
chinese
music
is
apt
to
be
somewhat
disturbing
from
the
watershed
i
got
a
fine
view
of
the
mountains
i
had
crossed
yesterday
some
ten
miles
or
so
to
the
north
was
the
highest
peak
in
the
range
i
think
it
is
called
and
clear
against
the
sky
and
some
feet
high
so
far
as
i
could
judge
an
easy
stage
brought
me
to
tengyueh
i
stayed
here
a
day
only
embery
of
the
china
inland
mission
a
countryman
of
my
own
kindly
putting
me
up
but
tengyueh
as
one
of
the
quartet
of
open
ports
in
the
province
is
well
known
it
is
only
a
small
town
however
and
one
was
surprised
to
find
it
as
conservative
a
town
as
could
be
found
anywhere
in
the
province
despite
the
fact
that
foreigners
have
been
here
for
many
years
and
at
the
present
time
there
are
no
less
than
seven
europeans
here
i
was
glad
of
a
rest
here
from
had
been
most
fatiguing

of
the

up
the
salwen
motive
for
travelling
and
how
i
not
a
the
litton
as
a
in
religion
to
of
ancestral
of
the
the
baptist
and
author
previous
for
subsequent
travel
fall
work
among
the
on
my
return
journey
into
i
stopped
at
bb
and
left
my
men
at
the
inn
there
while
i
traveled
for
two
days
along
the
salwen
valley
my
journey
was
taken
with
no
other
motive
than
that
of
seeing
the
country
and
also
to
test
the
accuracy
of
the
reports
respecting
the
general
unhealthy
nature
of
this
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
the
people
here
were
friendly
despite
the
fact
that
my
route
was
always
far
away
from
the
main
road
and
although
my
entire
kit
was
a
single
for
the
nights
i
was
able
to
get
all
i
wanted
lao
chang
accompanied
me
and
together
we
had
an
excellent
time
i
might
as
well
say
first
of
all
that
the
idea
of
this
part
of
the
salwen
valley
being
what
people
say
it
is
in
the
matter
of
a
is
absolutely
false
with
the
exception
of
the
early
morning
mist
common
in
every
region
in
hot
countries
there
was
so
far
as
i
could
see
nothing
to
fear
during
the
second
day
through
beautiful
country
in
beautiful
weather
i
came
across
some
people
who
i
presumed
were
and
i
regretted
that
my
films
had
all
been
exposed
the
tribe
is
undoubtedly
an
offshoot
from
the
people
who
inhabit
tibet
although
none
of
them
anywhere
in
and
they
are
found
in
many
places
in
central
and
eastern
bear
any
traces
of
buddhistic
belief
which
is
universal
of
course
in
tibet
the
late
litton
who
at
the
time
he
was
acting
as
british
consul
at
tengyueh
traveled
somewhat
extensively
among
them
says
that
their
religious
practices
closely
resemble
those
of
the
kachins
who
believe
in
numerous
nats
or
spirits
which
cause
various
calamities
such
as
failure
of
crops
and
physical
ailments
unless
propitiated
in
a
suitable
manner
according
to
him
the
most
important
spirit
is
the
ancestral
ghost
graves
are
generally
in
the
fields
near
the
villages
and
over
them
is
put
the
and
other
articles
used
by
the
deceased
it
is
probably
from
foundations
such
as
these
writes
george
forrest
who
accompanied
litton
on
an
excursion
to
the
upper
salwen
and
who
wrote
up
the
journey
after
the
death
of
his
companion
that
the
fabric
of
chinese
ancestor
worship
was
constructed
a
view
which
i
doubt
very
much
indeed
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
the
may
be
closely
allied
to
the
lolo
or
the
nou
su
of
whom
i
have
spoken
in
the
chapters
in
book
i
dealing
with
the
tribes
around
and
even
the
miao
bear
a
distinct
racial
resemblance
they
are
of
bony
physique
high
cheek
bones
and
their
skin
is
nearly
of
the
same
almost
sepia
color
the
form
practically
the
whole
of
the
population
of
the
upper
salwen
valley
from
about
lat
to
and
they
have
spread
in
considerable
numbers
along
the
mountains
between
the
shweli
and
the
irawadi
and
are
found
also
in
the
shan
states
those
on
the
upper
salwen
in
the
extreme
north
are
utter
savages
but
where
they
have
become
more
or
less
civilized
have
shown
themselves
to
be
an
enterprising
race
in
the
way
of
emigration
of
the
savages
the
villages
are
almost
always
at
war
with
one
another
and
many
have
never
been
farther
from
their
huts
than
a
day
march
will
take
them
the
chief
object
of
their
lives
being
apparently
to
keep
their
neighbors
at
a
distance
they
are
exceedingly
lazy
they
spend
their
lives
doing
as
little
in
the
way
of
work
as
they
must
eating
drinking
squatting
about
round
the
hearth
telling
stories
of
their
valor
with
the
and
their
excitement
is
provided
by
an
occasional
expedition
to
get
wood
for
their
and
poison
for
their
arrows
or
a
stock
of
salt
and
wild
honey
forrest
in
his
paper
which
was
read
before
the
royal
geographical
society
in
june
speaks
of
this
wild
honey
as
an
agreeable
sweetmeat
as
a
change
but
that
after
a
few
days
constant
partaking
of
it
the
european
palate
rejects
it
as
nauseous
and
almost
disgusting
and
adds
that
it
has
escaped
the
biblical
commentators
that
one
of
the
principal
hardships
which
john
the
baptist
must
have
undergone
was
his
diet
of
wild
honey
in
another
part
of
his
paper
the
writer
says
speaking
of
the
to
which
i
have
referred
every
with
any
pretensions
to
possesses
at
least
one
of
these
weapons
one
for
everyday
use
in
hunting
the
other
for
war
the
children

with
miniature
the
men
never
leave
their
huts
for
any
purpose
without

they
go
to

hung
over
their
heads
and
when
they
die
it
is
hung
over
their
graves
the
largest
have
a
span
of
fully
five
feet
and
require
a
pull
of
pounds
to
string
them
the
bow
is
made
of
a
species
of
wild
mulberry
of
great
toughness
and
flexibility
the
stock
some
four
feet
long
in
the
is
usually
of
wild
plum
wood
the
string
is
of
plaited
hemp
and
the
trigger
of
bone
the
arrow
of
sixteen
to
eighteen
inches
is
of
split
bamboo
about
four
times
the
thickness
of
an
ordinary
knitting
needle
hardened
and
pointed
the
actual
point
is
bare
for
a
quarter
to
of
an
inch
then
for
fully
an
inch
the
arrow
is
stripped
to
half
its
thickness
and
on
this
portion
the
poison
is
placed
the
poison
used
is
invariably
a
decoction
expressed
from
the
tubers
of
a
species
of
which
grows
on
those
ranges
at
an
altitude
of
to
feet
the
reduction
in
thickness
of
the
arrow
where
the
poison
is
placed
causes
the
point
to
break
off
in
the
body
of
anyone
whom
it
strikes
and
as
each
carries
enough
poison
to
kill
a
cart
horse
a
wound
is
invariably
fatal
free
and
immediate
incision
is
the
usual
remedy
when
wounded
on
a
limb
or
fleshy
part
of
the
body
bc
some
time
after
i
was
traveling
in
these
regions
i
made
arrangements
to
visit
the
mission
station
of
the
china
inland
mission
some
days
from
where
a
special
work
has
recently
been
formed
among
the
tribe
owing
to
a
later
arrival
at
the
capital
than
i
had
expected
however
i
could
not
keep
my
appointment
and
as
there
were
reports
of
trouble
in
that
area
the
british
did
not
wish
me
to
travel
off
the
main
road
it
is
highly
encouraging
to
learn
that
a
magnificent
missionary
work
is
being
done
among
the
all
the
more
gratifying
because
of
the
enormous
difficulties
which
have
already
been
overcome
by
the
pioneering
workers
at
least
one
european
if
not
more
has
mastered
the
language
and
the
china
inland
mission
are
expecting
great
things
to
eventuate
it
is
only
by
long
and
continued
residence
among
these
peoples
throwing
in
one
lot
with
them
and
living
their
life
that
any
absolutely
reliable
data
regarding
them
will
be
forthcoming

therefore
left
pretty
much
to
himself
and
the
pleasant
march
from
tengyueh
to
bhamo
the
metropolis
of
upper
burma
probably
offers
to
the
traveler
objects
and
scenes
of
more
varying
interest
than
any
other
stage
of
the
tramp
from
to
the
englishman
daily
getting
nearer
to
the
end
of
his
long
wearying
walk
and
going
for
the
first
time
into
upper
burma
incidentally
to
realize
again
the
dream
of
civilization
and
comfort
and
contact
with
his
own
kind
leaving
old
china
in
the

there
instinctively
came

inexpressible
patriotic
pride
every
britisher
must
feel

his
foot
again

benefits
are
too
numerous
to

you
must
have
come
through

and
have
had
for
companionship
only
your
own
unsympathetic
coolies

there
is

exertion
in
climbing
to
get
over
the
country
with
no
hills
to

no

to
cut
my

or
slip
upon
with
wide
sweeps
of
magnificent
country
leading
three
days
later
into
dense
tropical
jungle
entrancing
to
the
merest
tyro
of
a
nature
student
and
with
the
knowledge
that
my
walking
was
almost
at
an
end
all
would
have
gone
well
had
i
been
able
to
tear
from
my
mind
the
fact
that
at
this
juncture
i
should
have
to
make
to
the
reader
a
great
confession
of
foiled
plans
for
two
days
i
was
accompanied
by
the
rev
embery
of
the
china
inland
mission
who
was
making
an
itinerary
among
the
tribes
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
taping
which
we
followed
most
of
the
time
he
rode
a
mule
and
am
i
not
justified
in
believing
that
you
too
reader
with
such
an
excellent
companion
one
who
had
such
a
perfect
command
of
the
language
and
who
could
make
the
journey
so
much
more
interesting
you
would
have
ridden
your
pony
i
rode
mine
i
abandoned
pedestrianism
and
rode
to
two
full
days
and
when
after
a
pleasant
rest
under
a
sheltering
banyan
we
went
our
different
ways
i
was
sorry
indeed
to
have
to
fall
back
upon
my
men
for
companionship
but
it
was
not
to
be
for
long
nantien
is
or
was
to
be
a
fort
but
the
little
place
bears
no
outward
military
evidences
whatever
which
would
lead
one
to
believe
it
it
is
populated
chiefly
by
shans
the
bulk
of
these
interesting
people
now
live
split
up
into
a
great
number
of
states
some
tributary
to
burma
some
to
china
and
some
to
siam
and
yet
the
knows
little
about
them
one
can
not
mistake
them
especially
the
women
with
their
peculiar
mongolian
features
and
sallow
complexions
and
characteristic
the
men
are
less
distinguishable
probably
generally
speaking
but
the
rough
cotton
turban
instead
of
the
round
cap
with
the
knob
on
the
top
alone
enables
one
more
readily
to
pick
them
out
from
the
chinese
short
and
strongly
made
the
women
strike
one
particularly
as
being
a
hardy
healthy
set
of
people
shans
are
recognized
to
be
a
peaceful
people
but
a
village
squabble
outside
in
which
i
took
part
is
one
of
the
exceptions
to
prove
the
rule
it
did
not
take
the
eye
of
a
hawk
or
the
ear
of
a
pointer
to
recognize
that
a
big
row
was
in
full
progress
shan
women
roundly
abused
the
men
and
shan
men
standing
afar
off
abused
their
women
a
few
chinese
who
looked
on
had
a
few
words
to
say
to
these
pai
yi
bd
on
the
futility
of
these
everyday
squabbles
whilst
a
few
shans
mistaking
me
again
for
a
foreign
official
came
vigorously
to
me
pouring
out
their
souls
over
the
whole
affair
we
were
all
visibly
at
cross
purposes
i
chimed
in
with
my
infallible
puh
tong
you
stupid
ass
puh
tong
i
do
understand
i
do
understand
and
what
with
the
noise
of
the
disputants
the
chinese
bystanders
my
own
men
they
were
all
acutely
disgusted
with
every
shan
in
the
district
and
plainly
showed
it
because
they
could
not
be
understood
in
speech
and
myself
all
talking
at
once
and
the
dogs
who
mistook
me
for
a
beggar
and
tried
to
get
at
close
grips
with
me
for
being
one
of
that
fraternity
it
was
a
veritable
bedlam
and
tower
of
babel
in
awfullest
combination
at
length
i
raised
my
hand
mounted
a
boulder
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
endeavored
to
pacify
the
infuriated
mob
i
shouted
harshly
i
brandished
by
bamboo
in
the
air
i
gesticulated
i
whacked
two
men
who
came
near
me
at
last
they
stopped
expecting
me
to
speak
only
a
look
of
stupidest
unintelligibility
could
i
return
however
and
had
to
roar
with
laughter
at
the
very
foolishness
of
my
position
up
on
that
stone
soon
the
multitude
calmed
down
and
laughed
too
i
yelled
and
we
proceeded
leaving
the
shans
again
at
peace
with
all
the
world
shans
have
been
found
in
many
other
parts
even
as
far
north
as
the
borders
of
tibet
but
a
shan
owing
to
the
similarity
of
his
language
in
all
parts
of
asia
differs
from
the
chinese
or
the
tribesman
in
that
he
can
get
on
anywhere
it
is
said
that
from
the
sources
of
the
irawadi
down
to
the
borders
of
siamese
territory
and
from
assam
to
tonkin
a
region
measuring
six
hundred
miles
each
way
and
including
the
whole
of
the
former
empire
the
language
is
practically
the
same
dialects
exist
as
they
do
in
every
country
in
the
world
but
a
shan
born
anywhere
within
these
bounds
will
find
himself
able
to
carry
on
a
conversation
in
parts
of
the
country
he
has
never
heard
of
hundreds
of
miles
from
his
own
home
and
this
is
more
than
six
hundred
years
after
the
fall
of
the
dynasty
and
among
shans
who
have
had
no
real
political
or
commercial
relation
with
each
other
be
i
found
them
a
charming
people
peaceful
and
obliging
treating
strangers
with
kindness
and
frank
cordiality
for
the
most
part
they
are
buddhists
the
dress
of
the
chinese
shans
which
however
i
found
varied
in
different
localities
leads
one
to
believe
that
they
are
an
exceptionally
clean
race
but
i
can
testify
that
this
is
not
the
case
in
many
ways
they
are
dirtier
than
the
chinese
notably
in
the
preparation
of
their
food
and
i
feel
compelled
to
say
a
word
here
for
the
general
benefit
of
future
travelers
expect
a
shan
to
work
hard
he
work
hard
and
he
will
when
he
likes
but
i
do
not
believe
that
even
the
malay
that
nature
gentleman
of
the
farther
south
is
lazier
as
servants
they
are
failures
a
european
in
this
district
whose
chinese
servant
had
left
him
thought
he
would
try
a
shan
and
invited
a
man
to
come
be
your
servant
of
course
i
will
i
am
honored
and
the
european
thought
at
last
he
was
in
clover
he
explained
that
he
should
want
his
breakfast
at
and
that
the
servant
duties
would
be
to
cut
grass
for
the
horse
go
to
the
market
to
buy
provisions
feed
on
the
premises
and
leave
for
home
to
sleep
at
the
shan
opened
a
large
mouth
then
he
spoke
he
would
be
pleased
he
said
to
come
to
work
about
nine
that
he
had
several
marriageable
daughters
still
on
his
hands
and
could
not
therefore
and
would
not
cut
grass
he
objected
going
to
the
market
in
the

of

another

oh
give

rolled

i
hear
that

who
loves
experiments
of

has
gone

the

was
going
through
a
sort
of
new
year
carousal
as
i
entered
the
town
and
everybody
was
garmented
for
the
festival
i
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
a
place
to
stay
people
allowed
me
to
career
about
in
search
of
a
room
treating
me
with
courteous
indifference
but
none
offered
to
house
me
at
last
the
headman
of
the
village
appeared
and
with
many
kindly
expressions
of
unintelligibility
led
me
to
his
house
a
crowd
had
gathered
in
the
street
and
several
women
were
taking
from
the
front
room
the
general
of
the
village
ironmonger
scores
of
huge
iron
cooking
pans
were
being
passed
through
the
window
tables
were
pushed
noisily
through
the
doorway
primitive
cooking
appliances
were
being
hurled
about
in
the
air
bamboo
baskets
came
out
by
the
dozen
and
there
was
much
else
bags
of
paddy
old
chairs
the
low
stool
of
the
shan
with
a
back
drawers
of
copper
cash
brooms
a
few
old
spears
pots
of
pork
fat
barrels
of
wine
the
same
as
i
had
blistered
the
foot
of
a
pony
with
two
or
three
old
clothes
disused
ladies
shoes
babies
gear
and
last
of
all
the
man
himself
appeared
men
and
women
set
to
to
clean
up
an
old
woman
clasped
me
to
her
bosom
and
i
was
bidden
to
enter
new
year
festivities
were
for
the
nonce
neglected
for
the
novel
delight
of
gazing
upon
the
inner
domesticity
of
this
traveling
wonder
into
his
very
holy
of
holies
i
received
nine
invitations
to
dinner
i
dined
with
mine
host
and
his
six
sons
through
the
heavy
evening
murk
a
dull
clangor
stirred
the
air
the
tolling
of
shrill
bells
and
the
beating
of
dull
gongs
and
all
the
hideous
paraphernalia
of
eastern
celebrations
the
populace
shan
almost
to
a
man
were
bent
on
seeing
me
a
task
rendered
difficult
by
the
gathering
darkness
of
night
soldiers
guarded
the
way
and
there
were
several
broken
heads
they
came
stared
and
wondered
and
then
passed
away
for
others
to
come
in
shoals
laughingly
and
seeming
no
longer
to
harbor
the
hostile
feelings
apparent
as
i
entered
the
town
my
shaving
magnifier
amused
them
wonderfully
there
was
an
outcry
as
i
entered
the
room
after
we
had
dined
followed
by
a
scream
of
women
in
almost
hysterical
laughter
when
they
caught
sight
of
me
however
a
brief
pause
ensued
and
the
solemn
hush
that
even
in
a
callous
crowd
invariably
attends
the
actual
presence
of
a
personage
reigned
unbroken
for
a
while
then
one
spoke
then
another
ventured
to
address
me
and
the
spell
of
silence
gave
way
to
noise
and
general
excitability
and
the
people
began
speedily
to
close
upon
me
anxious
to
get
a
glimpse
of
such
a
peculiar
white
man
later
on
when
the
shutters
were
up
and
the
public
thus
kept
off
the
family
foregathered
unasked
into
my
room
bringing
with
them
their
own
tea
and
nuts
and
laying
themselves
out
to
be
entertained
my
whole
gear
now
reduced
to
most
meager
proportions
was
scrutinized
by
all
there
were
four
men
and
five
women
the
usual
offshoots
and
the
aged
couple
who
held
proprietary
rights
over
the
place
they
sat
on
my
bed
on
my
boxes
one
of
the
children
sat
on
my
knee
and
the
ladies
seemingly
of
the
easiest
virtue
overhauled
my
bedclothes
unblushingly
the
murmuring
noise
of
the
vast
expectant
new
year
multitude
died
off
gradually
like
the
retreating
surge
of
a
distant
sea
and
the
hot
motionless
atmosphere
in
my
room
with
eleven
people
stepping
on
one
another
toes
in
the
cramped
area
became
more
and
more
weightily
intensified
the
husband
of
one
of
the
women
a
miserable
emaciated
specimen
for
a
shan
came
forward
asking
whether
i
could
cure
his
disease
i
fear
he
will
never
be
cured
his
arm
and
one
side
of
his
body
was
one
mass
of
sores
before
it
could
be
seen
four
layers
of
chinese
paper
had
to
be
removed
one
huge
plantain
leaf
and
a
thick
layer
of
black
stuff
resembling
tar
i
was
busy
for
some
thirty
minutes
dressing
it
with
new
bandages
i
then
gave
him
ointment
for
subsequent
dressings
whereupon
he
put
on
his
coat
and
walked
out
of
the
room
leaving
the
door
open
as
he
went
without
even
a
word
of
gratitude
the
chinese
pride
themselves
upon
their
gratitude
it
is
vigorous
towards
the
dead
and
perhaps
towards
the
emperor
although
this
may
be
doubted
but
as
a
grace
of
daily
life
it
is
almost
absent
i
have
known
cases
where
missionaries
have
got
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
attend
to
poisoning
cases
and
accidents
requiring
urgent
treatment
have
known
them
to
attend
to
people
at
great
distances
from
their
own
homes
and
make
them
better
but
never
a
word
of
thanks
not
even
the
mere
pittance
charged
for
the
actual
cost
of
medicine

was
now
two
days
march
from

british
burma
border
the
landscape
in
this

was
solemn
and
imposing
as
i
trudged
on
again
very
tired
indeed
after
a
day
rest
at
in
the
morning
heavy
tropical
vapors
of
milky
whiteness
stretched
over
the
sky
and
the
earth

seemed
sleeping
as
if
wrapped
in
a
light
veil
it
attracted
me
and
absorbed

ennui
invaded
me
at
first
and
under
the
constraint
of
influences
so
fatal
to
human
personality
thought
died
away
by
degrees
like
a
flame
in
a
vacuum
for
i
was
again
in
the
east
the
real
luxurious
indolent
east
the
true
land
of
pantheism
and
one
must
go
there
to
realize
the
indefinable
sensations
which
almost
make
the
nirvana
of
the
buddhist
comprehensible
the
river
taping
farther
down
so
different
from
its
aspect
a
couple
of
days
ago
where
it
rushed
at
a
tremendous
speed
over
its
rocky
bed
was
now
broad
and
calm
and
placid
and
extremely
picturesque
the
banks
were
covered
with
trees
beyond
manyüen
near
the
water
the
undergrowth
was
of
a
fine
green
but
on
a
higher
level
the
yellow
and
red
leaves
hardly
holding
on
to
the
withered
trees
were
carried
away
with
the
slightest
breath
of
wind
at
hsiao
singai
on
february
i
again
had
difficulty
in
getting
a
room
so
i
waited
and
whilst
my
men
searched
about
for
a
place
where
i
could
sleep
an
extremely
tall
fellow
came
up
to
me
and
having
felt
with
his
finger
and
thumb
the
texture
of
my
tweeds
and
expressed
satisfaction
thereof
said
come
elder
brother
i
have
my
dwelling
in
this
hostelry
and
my
upper
chamber
is
at
your
disposal
and
then
he
added
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
ko

whereat
i
became
wary
lao
chang
however
was
more
cute
whilst
i
was
assuring
this
that
he
must
not
think
the
stranger
churlish
in
not
accepting
at
once
the
proffered
services
but
that
i
would
go
to
look
at
the
room
he
sprang
past
us
and
went
on
ahead
in
a
few
moments
i
was
slowly
going
hence
with
the
multitude
lao
chang
nodded
carelessly
to
the
strange
company
there
assembled
and
passing
through
the
room
with
a
soft
tread
began
to
ascend
a
dark
flight
of
narrow
stairs
leading
to
the
second
floor
of
the
inn
and
i
down
below
startled
and
bewildered
by
mysterious
words
from
everyone
watched
his
blue
garments
vanishing
upwards
and
like
a
man
driven
by
irresistible
necessity
muttered
incoherent
excuses
to
my
amazed
companions
and
in
a
blind
unreasoning
unconquerable
impulse
rushed
after
him
but
i
wish
i
had
not
there
were
several
ladies
who
all
more
or
less
scampered
around
with
their
bundles
of
gear
sewing
babies
clothes
tin
pots
hair
ornaments
boxes
of
powder
and
scented
soap
of
that
finest
quality
imported
from
burma
selling
for
less
than
you
can
buy
the
genuine
article
for
in
london
and
then
we
took
possession
if
once
there
is
a
railway
to
tengyueh
from
burma
a
visit
to
west
china
even
on
to
for
those
who
are
prepared
to
rough
it
a
little
will
become
quite
a
common
trip
a
few
days
up
the
irawadi
to
bhamo
through
scenery
of
a
peculiar
kind
of
beauty
eclipsed
on
none
other
of
the
world
great
rivers
would
be
succeeded
by
a
day
or
two
over
some
of
the
best
country
which
upper
burma
anywhere
affords
and
then
when
once
past
tengyueh
the
grandeur
of
the
mountains
is
amply
compensating
to
those
who
love
nature
in
her
beautiful
isolation
and
peace
from
a
recuperating
standpoint
perhaps
it
would
not
quite
answer
the
rains
would
be
a
drawback
to
road
travel
and
it
would
at
best
mean
roughing
it
but
for
the
many
in
burma
who
wish
to
take
a
holiday
and
have
not
the
time
to
go
to
europe
i
see
no
reason
why
tengyueh
should
not
develop
into
what
darjeeling
is
to
calcutta
and
what
japan
is
to
the
british
ports
farther
east
expense
would
not
be
heavy
to
bhamo
would
be
easy
as
things
now
stand
with
no
railway
one
would
need
to
take
a
few
provisions
and
cooking
utensils
and
a
camp
bed
and
tent
unless
one
would
be
prepared
to
do
as
the
author
did
and
patronize
chinese
inns
such
as
they
are
the
rest
would
be
easy
to
get
on
the
road
for
three
days
from
bhamo
dâk
bungalows
are
available
and
to
a
man
knowing
the
country
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
arrange
his
comforts
to
one
who
knows
the
conditions
there
is
in
the
trip
a
good
deal
to
fascinate
for
in
the
lives
and
customs
of
the
people
in
the
nature
of
the
country
in
the
life
the
traveler
would
himself
develop
having
a
peep
at
things
as
they
were
back
in
the
ancient
days
of
the
bible
to
the
professional
or
commercial
there
is
nothing
better
in
the
whole
of
the
east
he
would
get
some
excellent
shooting
especially
in
the
salwen
valley
not
exactly
a
health
resort
however
and
had
he
inclinations
towards
botanical
ethnological
craniological
or
philological
studies
he
would
be
at
a
loss
to
find
anywhere
in
the
world
a
more
interesting
area
but
a
man
should
never
leave
the
ta
lu
the
main
road
in
china
if
he
would
experience
the
minimum
of
discomfort
and
annoyance
which
under
best
conditions
is
considerable
to
an
irritable
man
as
i
sit
down
now
on
the
very
spot
where
margary
of
the
british
consulate
service
was
murdered
in
i
regret
that
i
have
sacrificed
a
great
deal
to
secure
most
of
the
photographs
which
decorate
this
section
of
my
book
no
one
not
even
my
military
escort
knows
the
way
and
is
being
sworn
at
by
my
men
therefor
how
i
am
to
reach
man
hsien
across
the
river
at
taping
i
do
not
quite
know
manyüen
so
interesting
in
history
is
a
native
town
untouched
by
the
years
slovenly
dirty
undisciplined
immoral
where
law
and
order
and
civilization
have
gained
at
best
but
a
precarious
foothold
the
most
characteristic
feature
of
the
people
being
the
gambler
instinct
but
i
remember
that
i
am
coming
into
burma
into
the
real
east
where
the
tangle
and
the
the
crooked
vision
and
the
distorted
travesty
of
the
truth
which
result
from
judging
the
oriental
from
the
standpoint
of
the
europeans
and
looking
at
the
east
through
the
eyes
of
the
west
impress
themselves
upon
one
mind
in
bewildering
fashion
as
a
hopeless
problem
everything
is
all
at
cross
purposes
however
although
i
lost
my
way
from
manyüen
to
man
hsien
i
got
my
photographs
of
kachins
those
people
whose
appearance
is
that
they
have
no
one
to
care
for
them
body
or
soul
their
thick
uncombed
locks
so
long
and
lank
as
to
resemble
deck
swabs
overlapped
roofwise
the
ugliest
aboriginal
faces
i
ever
saw
in
asia
or
america
and
their
eyes
under
shaggy
brows
looked
out
with
diabolical
fire
so
much
information
is
to
be
obtained
from
the
i
upper
burma
about
the
kachins
that
it
is
needless
for
me
to
write
much
here
especially
as
i
can
add
nothing
but
i
feel
i
should
like
to
say
just
a
word
of
praise
of
the
remarkable
work
of
the
american
baptist
mission
which
has
its
headquarters
at
bhamo
among
this
tribe
in
burma
at
the
time
i
arrived
in
the
city
the
annual
festival
was
being
conducted
at
the
baptist
church
and
hundreds
of
kachins
were
assembled
in
the
splendid
premises
of
this
mission
they
had
come
from
many
miles
around
and
to
one
who
at
previous
times
in
his
residence
in
the
far
east
had
written
disparagingly
about
missionaries
and
their
work
there
came
some
little
personal
shame
as
he
looked
upon
the
extremely
creditable
work
of
the
american
missionaries
in
this
district
kachins
are
a
somewhat
uncivilized
and
quarrelsome
race
unspeakably
immoral
and
steeped
in
every
vice
against
which
the
christian
missionary
has
to
set
his
face
a
most
difficult
people
to
work
among
but
there
i
saw
scores
and
scores
of
baptized
christians
living
a
life
clean
and
ennobling
endeavoring
honestly
to
break
away
from
their
degrading
customs
of
centuries
some
of
them
exceedingly
intelligent
people
i
speak
of
this
because
i
feel
that
in
the
face
of
untruthful
and
malicious
descriptions
which
in
former
years
have
got
into
print
respecting
this
very
mission
and
the
very
missionaries
on
this
field
it
is
only
fair
that
people
in
the
homeland
interested
in
the
work
should
know
what
their
american
brethren
are
doing
here
i
can
not
praise
too
highly
this
mission
and
the
enthusiastic
band
of
workers
whom
it
was
my
pleasure
to
meet
in
roberts
the
superintendent
of
the
field
the
american
baptist
board
have
a
man
of
wonderful
resource
who
is
not
only
an
ardent
christian
evangelist
and
capable
administrator
but
a
gentleman
of
considerable
business
ability
and
a
remarkable
organizer
a
writer
who
passing
through
in
was
indebted
to
roberts
for
many
kindnesses
found
that
the
only
adverse
criticism
he
could
make
of
the
missionary
was
in
respect
to
his
knowledge
of
horses
my
experience
is
that
in
the
whole
of
the
far
east
there
can
be
found
no
more
capable
pioneer
missionary
and
his
friends
in
america
should
pray
that
roberts
may
be
spared
many
years
still
to
control
the
work
on
the
successful
mission
field
in
which
he
has
spent
so
much
of
his
labor
of
love
for
the
kachins
kachins
form
the
bulk
of
the
population
in
the
extreme
north
of

the
west

extend

again
did
i
get
a
fright
that
my
manuscript
would
never
get
into
print
for
my
pony
rusty
probably
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
he
too
was
finishing
his
long
tramp
nearly
stamped
the
bottom
of
the
boat
out
and
threatened
to
send
us
down
by
river
past
bhamo
quicker
than
our
arrival
was
scheduled
the
large
official
paper
given
to
one
military
escort
from
point
to
point
was
here
produced
for
the
last
time
and
great
ado
was
made
about
me
reading
this
document
aloud
from
the
top
of
the
steps
when
he
came
to
my
name
the
mandarin
bowed
very
low
called
me
ding
daren
bg
a
sign
of
highest
respect
asked
if
i
would
exchange
cards
and
then
lapsed
unconsciously
into
profuse
congratulation
to
myself
that
i
should
have
been
born
an
englishman
so
far
as
he
knew
i
could
be
assured
that
the
existing
relations
between
the
administrative
bodies
of
his
contemptible
country
and
my
own
royal
land
were
of
a
nature
so
felicitously
mutual
and
peaceful
in
fact
both
governments
saw
eye
to
eye
in
regard
to
international
affairs
in
far
western
china
that
he
felt
sure
that
i
should
arrive
at
the
bridge
leading
into
burma
without
personal
harm
he
then
with
a
colossal
bow
to
myself
and
a
gentle
wave
of
his
handed
me
over
with
pungent
emphasis
of
speech
to
the
keeping
of
a
chinese
and
a
shan
who
with
a
keen
sense
of
favors
to
come
were
to
form
my
escort
to
burma
border
a
low
grunt
of
unrestrained
approval
came
from
the
multitude
the
underlings
people
who
ran
about
in
a
little
of
each
of
the
clothing
characteristic
of
the
four
said
races
were
all
busy
in
their
endeavors
to
extricate
from
me
a
few
cash
apiece
by
doing
all
and
more
than
was
necessary
then
the
great
man
rose
he
condescended
to
depart
he
passed
from
the
threshold
turned
paused
bowed
turned
again
went
down
the
steps
bowed
again
a
long
curving
bow
which
nearly
sent
him
to
the
ground
and
then
continued
with
a
light
heart
towards
that
loveliest
land
of
the
east
my
men
exhibited
no
emotion
that
they
were
coming
into
british
territory
was
of
no
concern
to
them
they
had
come
from
far
away
in
the
interior
and
were
the
greenest
of
the
green
the
rawest
of
the
raw
but
soon
i
passed
over
a
small
bridge
a
spot
where
two
great
empires
meet
i
was
in
burma
so
i
have
crossed
from
one
end
of
china
to
the
other
i
entered
china
on
march
i
came
out
on
february
i
had
come
to
see
how
far
the
modern
spirit
had
penetrated
into
the
hidden
recesses
of
the
chinese
empire
one
may
be
little
given
to
philosophizing
and
possess
but
scanty
skill
in
putting
into
words
the
conclusions
which
form
themselves
in
one
mind
but
it
is
impossible
to
cross
china
entirely
unobservant
one
must
begin
no
matter
how
dimly
to
perceive
something
of
the
causes
which
are
at
work
by
the
incoming
of
the
european
to
inland
china
a
transformation
is
being
wrought
not
the
natural
growth
of
a
gradual
evolution
itself
the
result
of
propulsion
from
within
but
produced
on
the
contrary
by
artificial
means
in
bitter
conflict
with
inherent
instincts
inherited
traditions
innate
tendencies
characteristics
and
genius
racial
and
individual
in
the
eyes
of
the
chinese
of
the
old
school
these
changes
in
the
habit
of
life
infinitely
old
are
improving
nothing
and
ruining
much
all
is
empty
vapid
useless
to
god
and
man
the
tawdry
shell
the
valueless
husk
of
ancient
chinese
life
is
here
still
remains
untouched
in
many
places
as
will
have
been
seen
in
previous
chapters
but
the
soul
within
is
steadily
and
surely
if
slowly
undergoing
a
process
of
final
atrophy
but
yet
the
proper
of
the
country
by
internal
reform
and
not
by
external
pressure
has
as
yet
hardly
commenced
in
immense
areas
of
the
empire
far
removed
from
the
imperial
city
of
peking
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
chinese
propose
such
an
absurd
program
as
that
which
plans
the
building
of
all
their
railways
without
the
aid
of
foreign
capital
is
sufficient
to
react
in
an
unwholesome
manner
economically
bh
bi
i
can
not
but
admit
that
whilst
in
most
parts
of
my
journey
there
are
distinct
traces
of
reform
i
speak
of
course
of
the
outlying
parts
of
china
and
some
very
striking
traces
too
and
a
real
longing
on
the
part
of
officials
to
escape
from
a
humiliating
international
position
it
is
distinctly
apparent
that
in
everything
which
concerns
europe
and
the
western
world
the
people
and
the
officials
as
a
whole
are
of
one
mind
in
the
methods
of
procrastination
which
are
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
celestial
and
that
peculiar
opposition
to
europeanism
which
has
marked
the
real
east
since
the
beginning
of
modern
history
and
now
lovely
lovely
burma
i
had
not
been
in
burma
two
minutes
before
the
very
box
containing
the
clothes
into
which
i
must
change
before
i
could
enter
into
the
social
life
of
bhamo
swung
from
the
broken
pole
of
one
of
my
coolies
and
rolled
rapidly
towards
the
river
it
was
recovered
after
great
trouble
thick
jungle
land
lay
out
before
me
fleecy
clouds
in
the
dense
blue
sky
hung
lazily
over
the
green
hills
the
heavy
air
was
pregnant
with
that
delicious
ease
known
only
in
the
tropics
all
was
still
and
sweet
the
river
flowed
grandly
from
the
interior
through
magnificent
forest
country
receiving
on
either
shore
the
frequent
tribute
of
other
minor
streams
and
its
banks
were
marvelous
cliffs
of
jungle
tangles
of
giant
trees
on
crowding
underwood
clinging
vine
and
festooning
parasite
rising
sheer
from
the
water
brink
now
long
clusters
of
villages
deep
in
the
shade
of
palm
and
fruit
trees
now
wide
expanses
of
meadow
where
the
grazing
grounds
dip
to
the
river
and
where
the
only
echoes
of
china
are
the
resting
caravans
the
banks
cut
into
huge
trampled
clefts
by
the
passage
of
the
kine
trooping
down
to
drink
occasional
wooded
islands
broke
the
monotony
of
the
river
and
were
just
discernible
from
the
magnificent
english
roads
which
skirted
the
hills
high
up
from
the
river
and
yellow
sandspits
and
big
wedges
of
granite
and
rock
ran
far
out
into
its
uneven
course
by
day
the
joyous
burma
sun
smiled
upon
all
and
at
midday
poured
its
merciless
heat
down
upon
all
mankind
unheeding
the
weary
wanderer
whose
tramp
was
now
near
done
at
night
the
tropical
moon
turned
all
this
riverine
world
to
the
likeness
of
a
very
fairyland
lying
in
a
long
chair
in
the
dâk
bungalows
one
drank
in
the
scenes
which
succeeded
one
another
in
bewildering
succession
and
felt
himself
thrilled
by
an
almost
fierce
appreciation
of
eastern
beauty
it
was
good
to
meet
again
an
englishman
a
sturdy
englishman
whose
love
of
the
east
like
mine
own
was
a
veritable
obsession

tropics
had
parched
the
color
out
of

white
skin
and
despite
the
fact
that
malaria
came
back
again
here
to
taunt
me
yet
i
was
again
in
the
east
that
i
loved
that
had
scarred

marked
me

my
