most
modern
writers
on
petrarch
agree
in
stating
that
of
all
his
works
the
dialogues
which
he
calls
are
the
one
which
throws
most
light
upon
the
man
himself
yet
no
english
translation
has
hitherto
been
published
a
french
version
by
victor
develay
was
issued
a
few
years
ago
and
received
the
recognition
of
the
french
academy
and
considering
the
great
importance
of
petrarch
in
the
history
of
the
renaissance
not
merely
in
italy
but
in
europe
it
is
time
that
a
similar
opportunity
of
knowing
him
more
fully
was
offered
to
english
readers
for
there
are
signs
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
that
the
number
of
those
interested
in
him
is
steadily
growing
the
reason
for
this
is
undoubtedly
the
fact
that
as
the
whole
work
of
petrarch
comes
to
be
better
known
interest
in
him
as
a
man
increases
sidney
lee
has
lately
reminded
us
of
his
wide
range
and
predominating
influence
in
the
matter
of
the
sonnet
in
france
and
in
elizabethan
england
as
well
as
in
his
own
country
and
yet
that
influence
was
very
far
indeed
from
revealing
all
that
petrarch
was
it
was
largely
an
influence
of
style
a
triumph
of
the
perfection
of
form
and
his
imitators
did
not
trouble
much
about
the
precise
nature
of
the
sentiment
and
spirit
informing
the
style
when
this
came
to
be
weighed
in
the
balances
of
a
later
day
the
tendency
of
english
feeling
was
to
regard
his
sentiment
as
a
trifle
too
serious
and
weak
the
of
the
cavaliers
brought
in
a
robuster
tone
when
once
the
question
was
raised
why
so
pale
and
wan
fond
lover
there
was
really
no
good
answer
to
it
on
petrarchan
lines
and
the
consequence
was
that
his
name
and
fame
suffered
something
of
eclipse
among
us
but
eclipses
are
transient
events
and
when
literary
england
felt
once
more
the
attraction
of
italy
in
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
not
only
dante
who
began
to
resume
his
sway
and
to
provoke
translation
but
petrarch
also
then
attention
was
turned
chiefly
to
his
italian
poetry
but
also
in
some
degree
to
the
general
body
of
his
latin
works
and
to
his
letters
of
which
it
is
reported
that
fox
was
among
the
first
to
perceive
the
high
value
in
england
the
pioneers
in
this
direction
were
susannah
dobson
who
published
first
a
life
of
petrarch
in
two
volumes
in
which
had
by
reached
a
sixth
edition
and
soon
after
another
volume
called
view
of
purporting
to
be
a
translation
but
in
fact
a
very
loose
and
attenuated
abstract
of
the
treatise
remediis
utriusque
fortunæ
which
nevertheless
reached
a
new
edition
in
then
came
a
volume
of
essays
on
petrarch
murray
by
the
italian
exile
ugo
foscolo
and
a
little
later
a
second
life
of
the
poet
by
no
less
a
person
than
thomas
campbell
also
in
two
volumes
testifying
to
the
interest
in
petrarch
numerous
translations
also
of
his
poetry
were
published
by
lady
dacre
hugh
boyd
leigh
hunt
capel
lofft
and
many
others
who
took
up
after
a
long
interval
the
tradition
begun
by
chaucer
and
handed
on
by
surrey
wyatt
sir
philip
sidney
spenser
drummond
of
hawthornden
and
george
chapman
then
for
a
while
there
was
a
pause
and
the
main
drift
of
such
attention
in
england
as
could
be
spared
for
things
italian
in
days
was
concentrated
on
the
greater
luminary
of
the
and
the
exciting
political
events
of
the
sixties
though
some
attention
was
drawn
to
things
connected
with
petrarch
by
lytton
novel
of
which
was
first
published
in
and
had
a
considerable
vogue
meanwhile
in
italy
itself
his
fame
was
well
served
by
the
excellent
collection
and
reprint
of
his
latin
letters
by
fracasetti
in
three
vols
and
since
that
time
there
have
appeared
several
important
works
dealing
with
the
larger
aspects
of
his
life
and
work
most
notable
among
them
being
koerting
leben
und
leipsig
and
in
france
de
nolhac
et
two
new
edition
with
other
subsidiary
works
and
four
small
volumes
by
henri
cochin
elucidating
what
is
known
of
petrarch
brother
gherardo
and
some
of
his
many
friends
amongst
ourselves
in
late
years
following
the
labours
of
j
symonds
in
his
history
of
the
renaissance
we
have
henry
reeve
small
but
volume
in
the
foreign
classics
for
english
readers
and
more
recently
still
hollway
calthrop
his
life
work
and
and
maud
jerrold
petrarca
poet
and
it
is
significant
that
both
the
last
writers
single
out
the
for
its
psychological
interest
the
former
stating
that
to
those
who
feel
the
charm
of
petrarch
nature
and
the
intense
humanity
of
his
character
these
three
dialogues
are
the
most
fascinating
of
all
his
writings
and
the
latter
that
this
conflict
of
the
dual
self
is
of
quite
peculiar
interest
jerrold
indeed
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
petrarch
plunges
into
the
most
scathing
that
any
man
ever
made
whether
the
book
was
intended
for
the
public
we
may
well
doubt
both
from
the
words
of
the
preface
and
from
the
fact
that
it
does
not
appear
to
have
been
published
till
after
the
author
death
but
however
this
may
be
it
remains
one
of
the
world
great
monuments
of
and
ranks
with
the
of
a
verdict
which
to
some
critics
will
seem
to
have
a
touch
of
overstatement
though
hardly
beyond
the
opinion
of
petrarch
french
students
and
not
altogether
unpardonable
in
so
enthusiastic
an
admirer
of
her
subject
and
a
verdict
which
at
least
would
not
have
been
displeasing
to
petrarch
himself
among
the
many
points
of
human
interest
to
be
found
in
the
dialogues
not
the
least
is
the
one
connected
with
accidie
a
theme
which
has
of
itself
attracted
special
study
in
the
present
day
particularly
since
attention
was
called
to
it
by
the
late
bishop
of
oxford
in
his
introduction
to
the
of
observers
of
mental
life
incline
to
the
view
that
the
form
of
depression
denoted
by
the
mediæval
word
was
not
confined
to
those
times
or
met
with
only
in
monasteries
and
it
is
curious
that
he
who
is
sometimes
called
the
first
of
the
moderns
should
take
us
into
his
confidence
as
to
his
sufferings
from
this
trouble
and
exemplify
the
truth
of
the
observation
to
which
reference
has
been
made
de
nolhac
in
his
interesting
work
entitled
frère
de
pétrarque
calls
particular
attention
to
this
trait
in
petrarch
character
and
in
an
appendix
on
the
subject
writes
mais
il
faut
surtout
lire
discussion
que
pétrarque
dans
le
second
dialogue
du
suppose
entre
saint
augustin
et
les
aveux
entrecoupés
de
sanglots
laisse
échapper
cette
torture
où
il
passe
des
jours
et
des
nuits
a
pourtant
en
elle
je
ne
sais
quelle
atroce
volupté
tellement
que
parfois
il
en
conte
de
arracher
it
is
the
remarking
on
this
note
of
this
dolendi
that
de
nolhac
considers
is
petrarch
special
contribution
to
the
subject
and
furnishes
a
new
point
beyond
what
is
in
previous
definitions
the
fundamental
question
raised
by
these
dialogues
is
the
question
of
what
was
the
real
nature
and
character
of
petrarch
and
wherein
lay
the
secret
of
his
extraordinary
charm
and
influence
among
his
contemporaries
and
especially
among
contemporary
men
it
is
difficult
to
convey
in
few
words
how
great
an
impression
the
study
of
his
latin
works
makes
in
regard
to
this
influence
in
his
own
lifetime
of
course
a
reader
is
soon
aware
of
the
trait
of
personal
vanity
in
petrarch
and
of
certain
unconscious
littlenesses
as
in
the
matter
of
his
appreciation
of
dante
but
the
strange
thing
is
how
little
this
interfered
with
the
regard
and
admiration
extended
to
him
by
many
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
in
the
ordinary
intercourse
of
life
one
is
apt
to
think
such
a
trait
fatal
to
anything
like
respect
and
it
must
always
detract
somewhat
from
the
full
stature
of
any
mind
but
in
the
case
of
petrarch
it
seems
evident
that
he
was
one
to
whom
much
was
forgiven
and
that
the
reason
is
to
be
found
in
the
presence
in
him
of
so
rich
an
assemblage
of
other
and
better
qualities
that
this
one
hardly
counted
at
all
or
was
looked
on
with
kindly
amusement
by
friends
enough
to
think
it
nothing
compared
with
what
was
good
and
admirable
in
his
mind
we
may
take
it
for
granted
that
as
he
hints
in
his
letter
to
posterity
he
started
with
the
advantage
of
a
good
presence
and
a
sufficient
care
of
his
own
person
and
appearance
in
younger
days
and
it
is
evident
that
he
had
by
nature
a
certain
engaging
frankness
and
impulsiveness
which
nevertheless
were
not
inconsistent
with
the
contrasted
qualities
of
gravity
and
dignity
learned
at
first
from
his
father
and
mother
and
their
friends
and
cultivated
by
his
study
of
the
law
and
afterwards
by
his
attendance
on
the
papal
court
at
avignon
one
can
discern
this
in
his
letters
and
see
it
reflected
in
those
that
were
written
to
him
or
about
him
but
beyond
these
introductory
qualities
as
they
may
be
called
there
were
other
deeper
traits
of
rarer
kind
that
must
be
noted
before
one
can
understand
the
position
he
attained
and
has
held
so
long
studying
his
work
from
the
cool
distance
of
six
centuries
one
is
inclined
to
judge
that
the
most
fundamental
quality
of
his
nature
was
his
love
of
literature
and
that
every
other
trait
took
a
subordinate
place
to
this
it
is
perhaps
doubtful
whether
this
or
the
life
of
personal
affection
or
even
of
devotion
in
a
monastery
would
have
gained
the
upper
hand
if
the
circumstances
of
his
life
had
been
different
in
the
matter
of
his
love
for
laura
but
taking
into
consideration
that
she
was
separated
from
him
apparently
by
temperament
and
circumstance
the
one
course
that
remained
open
to
him
without
let
or
hindrance
was
the
life
of
literature
in
the
sense
of
devotion
to
the
great
writers
of
the
past
and
the
practice
of
the
art
of
writing
for
himself
he
loved
this
for
its
own
sake
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
quickened
by
the
sense
of
a
new
learning
which
since
his
time
and
largely
by
the
impetus
he
gave
it
has
taken
form
and
outline
in
a
wonderful
way
but
was
then
only
like
the
first
streak
of
dawn
upon
the
sky
petrarch
was
not
the
first
man
to
find
a
certain
contradiction
between
his
desires
and
the
possibilities
of
life
around
him
and
to
pass
many
years
under
the
pain
of
contrary
attractions
that
could
not
all
be
followed
to
fulfilment
this
conflict
is
what
gives
interest
to
the
some
have
thought
and
the
idea
was
expressed
by
one
of
his
correspondents
that
his
love
for
laura
was
very
much
of
a
literary
pose
yet
that
such
a
view
is
an
insufficient
account
of
it
seems
pretty
clearly
established
by
the
work
here
translated
it
is
indeed
plain
that
his
feelings
ran
a
course
and
not
a
smooth
one
and
did
not
continue
in
one
stay
he
came
to
see
the
whole
matter
in
a
changed
light
and
yet
not
wholly
changed
his
relation
was
transfigured
not
abandoned
and
after
the
death
of
laura
which
took
place
when
he
was
it
continued
as
a
memory
from
which
the
pain
had
faded
away
and
only
what
was
uplifting
remained
that
which
persisted
unchanged
all
through
his
life
and
seems
most
to
have
had
the
colour
and
substance
of
a
passion
was
the
love
of
letters
to
this
his
friendship
his
very
real
patriotism
and
must
we
not
add
his
religion
also
were
in
a
sense
second
but
the
mention
of
this
last
factor
in
the
life
of
petrarch
leads
one
to
express
the
opinion
that
this
has
not
yet
been
quite
sufficiently
reckoned
with
that
it
should
not
have
been
thought
worthy
of
such
reckoning
has
probably
arisen
from
the
one
ugly
fact
in
his
life
which
he
himself
does
not
conceal
and
indeed
expressly
refers
to
in
his
letter
to
posterity
in
the
following
words
as
for
the
looser
indulgences
of
appetite
would
indeed
i
could
say
i
was
a
stranger
to
them
altogether
but
if
i
should
so
say
i
should
lie
this
i
can
safely
affirm
that
although
i
was
hurried
away
to
them
by
the
fervour
of
my
age
and
temperament
their
vileness
i
have
always
inwardly
execrated
as
soon
as
i
approached
my
fortieth
year
i
repelled
these
weaknesses
entirely
from
thoughts
and
my
remembrance
as
if
i
had
never
known
them
and
this
i
count
among
my
earliest
happy
recollections
thanking
god
who
has
freed
me
while
yet
my
powers
were
unimpaired
and
strong
from
this
so
vile
and
always
hateful
servitude
now
although
petrarch
did
not
as
some
other
men
have
done
including
his
own
brother
express
his
repentance
by
retiring
to
a
monastery
yet
there
is
evidence
enough
that
the
change
of
will
here
referred
to
and
professed
in
the
was
real
and
that
the
older
he
grew
the
more
he
lifted
up
his
heart
among
other
signs
of
this
there
is
the
curious
little
group
of
what
he
calls
psalms
which
were
translated
into
english
by
george
chapman
into
whose
translation
of
homer
keats
looked
and
was
inspired
in
his
will
also
there
are
not
a
few
passages
through
which
one
hears
a
note
of
genuine
penitence
among
other
curious
points
in
it
is
the
mention
of
the
exact
spot
in
which
he
would
wish
to
be
laid
to
rest
in
some
one
of
seven
different
places
where
he
might
happen
to
die
the
last
being
the
city
of
parma
of
which
he
says
at
si
parmæ
in
ecclesiâ
majori
ubi
per
multos
annos
archidiaconus
fui
inutilis
et
semper
fere
absens
petrarch
must
have
fully
weighed
in
his
own
case
the
pros
and
cons
for
such
retirement
his
treatise
otio
shows
that
he
understood
what
good
side
that
kind
of
life
has
and
his
whole
attitude
towards
his
brother
generous
and
attached
almost
to
the
point
of
romance
reveals
how
he
could
admire
it
but
in
his
own
case
he
felt
that
it
would
cramp
his
faculties
too
much
to
be
endurable
and
hinder
more
than
it
would
help
the
kind
of
work
to
which
he
had
put
his
hand
there
was
also
another
influence
that
told
strongly
on
this
father
of
humanism
he
whose
nature
was
so
full
of
unsatisfied
natural
affection
had
begun
in
his
latter
years
to
find
some
rest
and
blessing
in
the
love
and
tendance
of
a
daughter
the
light
of
whose
care
and
companionship
for
him
shines
through
his
declining
days
like
the
rays
of
the
sun
in
the
evening
after
a
dark
and
troubled
day
but
if
we
are
right
in
judging
that
the
love
of
letters
was
the
dominant
factor
in
the
life
of
petrarch
it
was
but
the
main
thread
in
a
singularly
complex
nature
not
much
less
in
substance
and
strength
was
his
genius
for
friendship
indeed
his
study
of
the
writers
of
past
ages
partook
of
the
nature
of
friendship
just
as
his
friendship
with
living
men
had
a
deep
literary
tinge
he
loved
books
and
he
loved
men
and
he
loved
them
in
the
same
way
this
is
by
no
means
a
frequent
combination
in
the
degree
in
which
it
was
shown
in
petrarch
more
often
the
becomes
a
recluse
and
the
lover
of
his
loses
his
ardour
for
study
but
not
even
the
love
of
books
and
of
men
took
up
all
the
activities
of
this
rich
nature
he
was
also
a
keen
traveller
and
among
the
first
to
write
of
natural
scenery
in
the
modern
spirit
he
had
that
in
him
which
in
spite
of
his
love
for
reading
and
writing
sent
him
forth
into
other
lands
and
made
him
eager
to
see
men
and
cities
yet
the
love
of
the
country
in
him
prevailed
over
the
love
of
cities
his
many
references
to
his
life
at
vaucluse
though
to
readers
of
they
may
seem
sometimes
affected
yet
show
only
a
superficial
affectation
a
mere
mode
which
does
not
seriously
lessen
the
impression
of
his
simple
taste
and
his
genuine
delight
in
his
garden
and
his
fishing
and
his
talk
with
the
charming
old
and
that
wife
for
whom
he
had
such
an
unbounded
respect
in
the
two
recent
lives
of
petrarch
in
english
a
reader
may
make
closer
acquaintance
with
this
side
of
his
character
and
will
find
much
that
falls
in
with
modern
feeling
as
to
simplicity
of
living
and
the
joys
of
escaping
from
the
town
but
what
is
still
a
desideratum
is
a
good
english
translation
of
his
letters
to
his
friends
which
will
add
many
glimpses
of
his
daily
interests
and
thoughts
and
fill
up
the
picture
of
his
interior
life
as
it
is
disclosed
to
us
in
the
dialogues
here
presented
what
the
us
is
the
picture
of
petrarch
as
he
was
in
the
crisis
of
his
middle
years
it
was
written
in
or
about
the
year
when
he
was
and
in
these
dialogues
we
find
him
looking
back
over
his
youth
and
early
life
the
sap
and
vigour
of
his
mind
as
strong
as
ever
the
recollection
of
many
sensations
green
and
still
powerful
but
finding
that
the
sheer
march
of
time
and
experience
of
manhood
are
forcing
him
now
to
see
things
with
more
mature
vision
five
years
later
he
will
be
seen
suddenly
kindled
into
surprising
excitement
in
that
strange
rienzi
episode
but
in
one
of
his
letters
to
that
unhappy
politician
there
is
a
sentence
which
might
have
been
penned
by
bishop
butler
and
has
in
it
the
accent
of
grave
experience
ibunt

things
will
go
as
the
law
eternal
has
decided
to
alter
their
course
is
out
of
our
power
what
we
can
do
is
to
get
out
of
their
way
the
interest
of
the
is
heightened
by
remembering
the
time
of
life
in
which
it
was
composed
some
will
find
most
pleasure
in
reading
what
men
have
written
and
others
prefer
the
charm
that
belongs
to
youth
but
is
there
not
much
to
be
said
for
the
interest
of
what
men
write
from
that
high
tableland
that
lies
between
the
two
in
the
full
strength
of
their
mind
when
they
have
lived
long
enough
to
know
what
is
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
youth
and
not
long
enough
to
be
wearied
and
broken
with
the
greatness
of
the
way
such
is
the
tone
that
seems
to
pervade
the
dialogues
between
augustine
and
petrarch
in
the
preface
he
looks
forward
to
cherishing
the
little
book
himself
in
future
years
like
some
flower
that
keeps
alive
remembrance
of
past
days
and
yet
is
not
cherished
for
memory
only
but
to
guard
the
resolution
which
has
been
taken
to
go
forward
and
not
back
and
as
his
french
translator
suggests
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
these
pages
written
with
such
in
which
he
has
laid
bare
his
whole
soul
should
have
been
his
own
favourite
work
it
was
the
book
he
kept
at
his
bedside
his
faithful
counsellor
and
friend
and
to
which
he
turned
ever
and
again
with
pleasure
in
the
hours
of
remembering
the
time
past
it
is
not
necessary
to
tell
over
again
the
story
of
petrarch
lifelong
devotion
to
the
study
of
augustine
or
to
dwell
on
the
obvious
reasons
for
that
devotion
every
man
loves
the
book
which
tells
the
history
of
conflicts
like
his
own
and
which
has
helped
to
give
him
courage
in
his
warfare
and
its
sorrows
and
joys
that
loss
is
common
would
not
make
my
own
less
bitter
rather
more
sings
the
poet
but
if
one
reads
the
experience
of
those
who
have
suffered
and
contended
and
conquered
and
is
sure
that
their
load
was
as
heavy
as
his
own
then
there
is
a
spirit
which
is
breathed
over
from
one
life
to
another
and
which
even
though
it
tells
us
how
great
is
the
burden
of
sorrow
in
the
world
yet
also
tells
us
that
a
man
is
not
alone
but
that
there
are
companions
in
patience
who
a
little
strengthen
each
other
and
give
the
sense
of
fellowship
from
age
to
age
aspiret

et
inclinentur
many
of
the
letters
of
petrarch
later
years
show
how
wistfully
he
waited
for
that
day
but
they
also
show
how
gallant
a
heart
he
kept
and
how
faithful
to
those
friends
that
remained
including
the
one
so
lovable
and
generous
and
true
giovanni
boccaccio
who
survived
him
little
more
than
a
year
petrarch
passed
the
end
of
his
life
in
a
modest
house
which
he
built
in
one
of
the
loveliest
parts
of
italy
that
to
english
readers
will
be
for
ever
dear
because
of
the
haunting
music
that
shelley
wove
around
its
name
it
was
in
the
euganæan
hills
at
arqua
where
petrarch
chose
to
wait
for
the
dawn
and
till
it
came
to
go
on
working
among
the
books
he
loved
as
his
own
soul
many
a
green
isle
needs
must
be
in
the
deep
wide
sea
of
misery
and
to
read
the
story
of
his
last
years
there
is
to
think
of
one
of
those
green
isles
these
were
days
of
calm
and
the
book
of
the
secret
ends
with
the
expression
of
hope
for
a
deeper
calm
still
in
due
time
it
came
but

poet

greeting

secret
author
preface
often
have
i
wondered
with
much
curiosity
as
to
our
coming
into
this
world
and
what
will
follow
our
departure
when
i
was
ruminating
lately
on
this
matter
not
in
any
dream
as
one
in
sickness
and
slumber
but
wide
awake
and
with
all
my
wits
about
me
i
was
greatly
astonished
to
behold
a
very
beautiful
lady
shining
with
an
indescribable
light
about
her
she
seemed
as
one
whose
beauty
is
not
known
as
it
might
be
to
mankind
i
could
not
tell
how
she
came
there
but
from
her
raiment
and
appearance
i
judged
her
a
fair
virgin
and
her
eyes
like
the
sun
seemed
to
send
forth
rays
of
such
light
that
they
made
me
lower
my
own
before
her
so
that
i
was
afraid
to
look
up
when
she
saw
this
she
said
fear
not
and
let
not
the
strangeness
of
my
presence
affright
you
in
any
wise
i
saw
your
steps
had
gone
astray
and
i
had
compassion
on
you
and
have
come
down
from
above
to
bring
you
timely
succour
hitherto
your
eyes
have
been
darkened
and
you
have
looked
too
much
yes
far
too
much
upon
the
things
of
earth
if
these
so
much
delight
you
what
shall
be
your
rapture
when
you
lift
your
gaze
to
things
eternal
when
i
heard
her
thus
speak
though
my
fear
still
clung
about
me
with
trembling
voice
i
made
reply
in
virgil
words
what
name
to
call
thee
by
o
virgin
fair
i
know
not
for
thy
looks
are
not
of
earth
and
more
than
mortal
seems
thy
countenance
i
am
that
lady
she
answered
whom
you
have
depicted
in
your
poem
with
rare
art
and
skill
and
for
whom
like
another
amphion
of
thebes
you
have
with
poetic
hands
built
a
fair
and
glorious
palace
in
the
far
west
on
atlas
lofty
peak
be
not
afraid
then
to
listen
and
to
look
upon
the
face
of
her
who
as
your
allegory
proves
has
been
to
you
from
of
old
scarcely
had
she
uttered
these
words
when
as
i
pondered
all
these
things
in
my
mind
it
occurred
to
me
this
could
be
none
other
than
truth
herself
who
thus
spoke
i
remembered
how
i
had
described
her
abode
on
the
heights
of
atlas
yet
was
i
ignorant
from
what
region
she
had
come
save
only
that
i
felt
assured
she
could
have
come
from
none
other
place
than
heaven
therefore
i
turned
my
gaze
towards
her
eagerly
desiring
to
look
upon
her
face
but
lo
the
eye
of
man
is
unable
to
gaze
on
that
ethereal
form
wherefore
again
was
i
forced
to
turn
them
towards
the
ground
when
she
took
note
of
this
after
a
short
silence
she
spoke
once
more
and
questioning
me
many
times
she
led
me
to
engage
with
her
in
long
discourse
from
this
converse
i
was
sensible
of
gaining
a
twofold
benefit
for
i
won
knowledge
and
the
very
act
of
talking
with
her
gave
me
confidence
i
found
myself
by
degrees
becoming
able
to
look
upon
the
face
which
at
first
dismayed
me
by
its
splendour
and
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
bear
it
without
dread
and
gaze
fixedly
on
her
wondrous
beauty
i
looked
to
see
if
she
were
accompanied
with
any
other
or
had
come
upon
the
retirement
of
my
solitude
alone
and
as
i
did
so
i
discerned
at
her
side
the
figure
of
an
aged
man
of
aspect
venerable
and
full
of
majesty
there
was
no
need
to
inquire
his
name
his
religious
bearing
modest
brow
his
eyes
full
of
dignity
his
measured
step
his
african
look
but
roman
speech
plainly
declared
him
to
be
that
most
illustrious
father
augustine
moreover
he
had
so
gracious
a
mien
and
withal
so
noble
that
one
could
not
possibly
imagine
it
to
belong
to
any
other
than
to
him
even
so
i
was
on
the
point
of
opening
my
lips
to
ask
when
at
that
moment
i
heard
the
name
so
dear
to
me
uttered
from
the
lips
of
truth
herself
turning
herself
to
him
as
if
to
intervene
upon
his
deep
meditation
she
addressed
him
in
these
words
augustine
dear
to
me
above
a
thousand
others
you
know
how
devoted
to
yourself
this
man
is
and
you
are
aware
also
with
how
dangerous
and
long
a
malady
he
is
stricken
and
that
he
is
so
much
nearer
to
death
as
he
knows
not
the
gravity
of
his
disease
it
is
needful
then
that
one
take
thought
for
this
man
life
forthwith
and
who
so
fit
to
undertake
the
pious
work
as
yourself
he
has
ever
been
deeply
attached
to
your
name
and
person
and
all
good
doctrine
is
wont
more
easily
to
enter
the
mind
of
the
disciple
when
he
already
starts
with
loving
the
master
from
whom
he
is
to
learn
unless
your
present
happiness
has
made
you
quite
forget
your
former
sorrow
you
will
remember
that
when
you
were
shut
in
the
prison
of
the
mortal
body
you
also
were
subject
to
like
temptation
as
his
and
if
that
were
so
most
excellent
physician
of
those
passions
yourself
experienced
even
though
your
silent
meditation
be
full
of
sweetness
to
your
mind
i
beg
that
your
sacred
voice
which
to
me
is
ever
a
delight
shall
break
its
silence
and
try
whether
you
are
able
by
some
means
to
bring
calm
to
one
so
deeply
distressed
augustine
answered
her
you
are
my
guide
my
counsellor
my
sovereign
my
ruler
what
is
it
then
you
would
have
me
say
in
your
presence
i
would
she
replied
that
some
human
voice
speak
to
the
ears
of
this
mortal
man
he
will
better
bear
to
hear
truth
so
but
seeing
that
whatever
you
shall
say
to
him
he
will
take
as
said
by
me
i
also
will
be
present
in
person
during
your
discourse
augustine
answered
her
the
love
i
bear
to
this
sick
man
as
well
as
the
authority
of
her
who
speaks
make
it
my
duty
to
obey
then
looking
kindly
at
me
and
pressing
me
to
his
heart
in
fatherly
embrace
he
led
me
away
to
the
most
retired
corner
he
could
find
and
truth
herself
went
on
a
few
steps
in
front
there
we
all
three
sat
down
then
while
truth
listened
as
the
silent
judge
none
other
beside
her
being
present
we
held
long
converse
on
one
side
and
the
other
and
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
theme
the
discourse
between
us
lasted
over
three
days
though
we
talked
of
many
things
much
against
the
manners
of
this
age
and
on
faults
and
failings
common
to
mankind
in
such
wise
that
the
reproaches
of
the
master
seemed
in
a
sense
more
directed
against
men
in
general
than
against
myself
yet
those
which
to
me
came
closest
home
i
have
graven
with
more
especial
vividness
on
the
tablet
of
my
memory
that
this
discourse
so
intimate
and
deep
might
not
be
lost
i
have
sot
it
down
in
writing
and
made
this
book
not
that
i
wish
to
class
it
with
my
other
works
or
desire
from
it
any
credit
my
thoughts
aim
higher
what
i
desire
is
that
i
may
be
able
by
reading
to
renew
as
often
as
i
wish
the
pleasure
i
felt
from
the
discourse
itself
so
little
book
i
bid
you
flee
the
haunts
of
men
and
be
content
to
stay
with
me
true
to
the
title
i
have
given
you
of
my
secret
and
when
i
would
think
upon
deep
matters
all
that
you
keep
in
remembrance
that
was
spoken
in
secret
you
in
secret
will
tell
to
me
over
again
to
avoid
the
too
frequent
iteration
of
the
words
said
i
said
he
and
to
bring
the
personages
of
the
dialogue
as
it
were
before
very
eyes
i
have
acted
on
cicero
method
and
merely
placed
the
name
of
each
interlocutor
before
each
paragraph
my
dear
master
learned
this
mode
himself
from
plato
but
to
cut
short
all
further
digression
this
is
how
augustine
opened
the
discourse
i
i
dialogue
the
first
augustine
petrarch
what
have
you
to
say
o
man
of
little
strength
of
what
are
you
dreaming
for
what
are
you
looking
remember
you
not
you
are
mortal
yes
i
remember
it
right
well
and
a
shudder
comes
upon
me
every
time
that
remembrance
rises
in
my
breast
may
you
indeed
remember
as
you
say
and
take
heed
for
yourself
you
will
spare
me
much
trouble
by
so
doing
for
there
con
be
no
doubt
that
to
recollect
one
misery
and
to
practise
frequent
meditation
on
death
is
the
surest
aid
in
scorning
the
seductions
of
this
world
and
in
ordering
the
soul
amid
its
storms
and
tempests
if
only
such
meditation
be
not
superficial
but
sink
into
the
bones
and
marrow
of
the
heart
yet
am
i
greatly
afraid
lest
that
happen
in
your
case
which
i
have
seen
in
so
many
others
and
you
be
found
deceiving
your
own
self
in
what
way
do
you
mean
for
i
do
not
clearly
understand
the
drift
of
your
remarks
o
race
of
mortal
men
this
it
is
that
above
all
makes
me
astonished
and
fearful
for
you
when
i
behold
you
of
your
own
will
clinging
to
your
miseries
pretending
that
you
do
not
know
the
peril
hanging
over
your
heads
and
if
one
bring
it
under
your
very
eyes
you
try
to
thrust
it
from
your
sight
and
put
it
afar
off
in
what
way
are
we
so
mad
do
you
suppose
there
is
any
living
man
so
unreasonable
that
if
he
found
himself
stricken
with
a
dangerous
ailment
he
would
not
anxiously
desire
to
regain
the
blessing
of
health
i
do
not
suppose
such
a
case
has
ever
been
heard
of
and
do
you
think
if
one
wished
for
a
thing
with
all
one
soul
one
would
be
so
idle
and
careless
as
not
to
use
all
possible
means
to
obtain
what
one
desired
no
one
i
think
would
be
so
foolish
if
we
are
agreed
on
these
two
points
so
we
ought
also
to
agree
on
a
third
what
is
this
third
point
it
is
this
that
just
as
he
who
by
deep
meditation
has
discovered
he
is
miserable
will
ardently
wish
to
be
so
no
more
and
as
he
who
has
formed
this
wish
will
seek
to
have
it
realised
so
he
who
seeks
will
be
able
to
reach
what
he
wishes
it
is
clear
that
the
third
step
depends
on
the
second
as
the
second
on
the
first
and
therefore
the
first
should
be
as
it
were
a
root
of
salvation
in
man
heart
now
you
mortal
men
and
you
yourself
with
all
your
power
of
mind
keep
doing
your
best
by
all
the
pleasures
of
the
world
to
pull
up
this
saving
root
out
of
your
hearts
which
as
i
said
fills
me
with
horror
and
wonder
with
justice
therefore
you
are
punished
by
the
loss
of
this
root
of
salvation
and
the
consequent
loss
of
all
the
rest
i
foresee
this
complaint
you
bring
is
likely
to
be
lengthy
and
take
many
words
to
develop
it
would
you
mind
therefore
postponing
it
to
another
occasion
and
that
i
may
travel
more
surely
to
your
conclusion
may
we
send
a
little
more
time
over
the
premisses
i
must
concede
something
to
your
slowness
of
mind
so
please
stop
me
at
any
point
where
you
wish
well
if
i
must
speak
for
myself
i
do
not
follow
your
chain
of
reasoning
what
possible
obscurity
is
there
in
it
what
are
you
in
doubt
about
now
i
believe
there
is
a
multitude
of
things
for
which
we
ardently
long
which
we
seek
for
with
all
our
energy
but
which
nevertheless
however
diligent
we
are
we
never
have
obtained
and
never
shall
that
may
be
true
of
other
desires
but
in
regard
to
that
we
have
now
under
discussion
the
case
is
wholly
different
what
makes
you
say
that
because
every
man
who
desires
to
be
delivered
from
his
misery
provided
only
he
desires
sincerely
and
with
all
his
heart
can
not
fail
to
obtain
that
which
he
desires
o
father
what
is
this
i
hear
there
are
few
men
indeed
who
do
not
feel
they
lack
many
things
and
who
would
not
confess
they
were
so
far
unhappy
every
one
who
questions
his
own
heart
will
acknowledge
it
is
so
by
natural
consequence
if
the
fulness
of
blessing
makes
man
happy
all
things
he
lacks
will
so
far
make
him
unhappy
this
burden
of
unhappiness
all
men
would
fain
lay
down
as
every
one
is
aware
but
every
one
is
aware
also
that
very
few
have
been
able
how
many
there
are
who
have
felt
the
crushing
weight
of
grief
through
bodily
disease
or
the
loss
of
those
they
loved
or
imprisonment
or
exile
or
hard
poverty
or
other
misfortunes
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
over
and
yet
they
who
suffer
these
things
have
only
too
often
to
lament
that
it
is
not
permitted
them
as
you
suggest
to
be
set
free
to
me
then
it
seems
quite
beyond
dispute
that
a
multitude
of
men
are
unhappy
by
compulsion
and
in
spite
of
themselves
i
must
take
you
a
long
way
back
and
as
one
does
with
the
very
young
whose
wits
are
slight
and
slow
i
must
ask
you
to
follow
out
the
thread
of
my
discourse
from
its
very
simplest
elements
i
thought
your
mind
was
more
advanced
and
i
had
no
idea
you
still
needed
lessons
so
childish
ah
if
only
you
had
kept
in
mind
those
true
and
saving
maxims
of
the
wise
which
you
have
so
often
read
and
with
me
if
i
must
take
leave
to
say
you
had
but
wrought
for
yourself
instead
of
others
if
you
had
but
applied
your
study
of
so
many
volumes
to
the
ruling
of
your
own
conduct
instead
of
to
vanity
and
gaining
the
empty
praise
of
men
you
would
not
want
to
retail
such
low
and
absurd
follies
i
know
not
where
you
want
to
take
me
but
already
i
am
aware
of
the
blush
mounting
to
my
brow
and
i
feel
like
schoolboys
in
presence
of
an
angry
master
before
they
know
what
they
are
accused
of
they
think
of
many
offences
of
which
they
are
guilty
and
at
the
very
first
word
from
the
master
lips
they
are
filled
with
confusion
in
like
case
i
too
am
conscious
of
my
ignorance
and
of
many
other
faults
and
though
i
perceive
not
the
drift
of
your
admonition
yet
as
i
know
almost
everything
bad
may
be
brought
against
me
i
blush
even
before
you
have
done
speaking
so
pray
state
more
clearly
what
is
this
biting
accusation
that
you
have
made
i
shall
have
many
things
to
lay
to
your
charge
presently
just
now
what
makes
me
so
indignant
is
to
hear
you
suppose
that
any
one
can
become
or
can
be
unhappy
against
his
will
i
might
as
well
spare
my
blushes
for
what
more
obvious
truth
than
this
can
possibly
be
imagined
what
man
exists
so
ignorant
or
so
far
removed
from
all
contact
with
the
world
as
not
to
know
that
penury
grief
disgrace
illness
death
and
other
evils
too
that
are
reckoned
among
the
greatest
often
befall
us
in
spite
of
ourselves
and
never
with
our
own
consent
from
which
it
follows
that
it
is
easy
enough
to
know
and
to
detest
one
own
misery
but
not
to
remove
it
so
that
if
the
two
first
steps
depend
on
ourselves
the
third
is
nevertheless
in
fortune
hand
when
i
saw
you
ashamed
i
was
ready
to
give
you
pardon
but
brazen
impudence
angers
me
more
than
error
itself
how
is
it
you
have
forgotten
all
those
wise
precepts
of
philosophy
which
declare
that
no
man
can
be
made
unhappy
by
those
things
you
rattle
off
by
name
now
if
it
is
virtue
only
that
makes
the
happiness
of
man
which
is
demonstrated
by
cicero
and
a
whole
multitude
of
weighty
reasons
it
follows
of
necessity
that
nothing
is
opposed
to
true
happiness
except
what
is
also
opposed
to
virtue
this
truth
you
can
yourself
call
to
mind
even
without
a
word
from
me
at
least
unless
your
wits
are
very
dull
i
remember
it
quite
well
you
would
have
me
bear
in
mind
the
precepts
of
the
stoics
which
contradict
the
opinions
of
the
crowd
and
are
nearer
truth
than
common
custom
is
you
would
indeed
be
of
all
men
the
most
miserable
were
you
to
try
to
arrive
at
the
truth
through
the
absurdities
of
the
crowd
or
to
suppose
that
under
the
leadership
of
blind
guides
you
would
reach
the
light
you
must
avoid
the
common
beaten
track
and
set
your
aspirations
higher
take
the
way
marked
by
the
steps
of
very
few
who
have
gone
before
if
you
would
be
counted
worthy
to
hear
the
word
on
brave
lad
on
your
courage
leading
you
so
only
heaven
is
scaled
heaven
grant
i
may
hear
it
ere
i
die
but
i
pray
you
to
proceed
for
i
assure
you
i
have
by
no
means
become
shameless
i
do
not
doubt
the
stoics
rules
are
wiser
far
than
the
blunders
of
the
crowd
i
await
therefore
your
further
counsel
since
we
are
agreed
on
this
that
no
one
can
become
or
be
unhappy
except
through
his
own
fault
what
need
of
more
words
is
there
just
this
need
that
i
think
i
have
seen
very
many
people
and
i
am
one
of
them
to
whom
nothing
is
more
distressful
than
the
inability
to
break
the
yoke
of
their
faults
though
all
their
life
long
they
make
the
greatest
efforts
so
to
do
wherefore
even
allowing
that
the
maxim
of
the
stoics
holds
good
one
may
yet
admit
that
many
people
are
very
unhappy
in
spite
of
themselves
yes
and
although
they
lament
it
and
wish
they
were
not
with
their
whole
heart
we
have
wandered
somewhat
from
our
course
but
we
are
slowly
working
back
to
our
or
have
you
quite
forgotten
whence
we
set
out
i
had
begun
to
lose
sight
of
it
but
it
is
coming
back
to
me
now
what
i
had
set
out
to
do
with
you
was
to
make
clear
that
the
first
step
in
avoiding
the
distresses
of
this
mortal
life
and
raising
the
soul
to
higher
things
is
to
practise
meditation
on
death
and
on
man
misery
and
that
the
second
is
to
have
a
vehement
desire
and
purpose
to
rise
when
these
two
things
were
present
i
promised
a
comparatively
easy
ascent
to
the
goal
of
our
desire
unless
haply
to
you
it
seems
otherwise
i
should
certainly
never
venture
to
affirm
this
for
from
my
youth
upwards
i
have
had
the
increasing
conviction
that
if
in
any
matter
i
was
inclined
to
think
differently
from
yourself
i
was
certain
to
be
wrong
we
will
please
waive
all
compliments
and
as
i
observe
you
are
inclined
to
admit
the
truth
of
my
words
more
out
of
deference
than
conviction
pray
feel
at
liberty
to
say
whatever
your
real
judgment
suggests
i
am
still
afraid
to
be
found
differing
but
nevertheless
i
will
make
use
of
the
liberty
you
grant
not
to
speak
of
other
men
i
call
to
witness
her
who
has
ever
been
the
ruling
spirit
of
my
life
you
yourself
also
i
call
to
witness
how
many
times
i
have
pondered
over
my
own
misery
and
over
the
subject
of
death
with
what
floods
of
tears
i
have
sought
to
wash
away
my
stains
so
that
i
can
scarce
speak
of
it
without
weeping
yet
hitherto
as
you
see
all
is
in
vain
this
alone
leads
me
to
doubt
the
truth
of
that
proposition
you
seek
to
establish
that
no
man
has
ever
fallen
into
misery
but
of
his
own
free
will
or
remained
miserable
except
of
his
own
accord
the
exact
opposite
of
which
i
have
proved
in
my
own
sad
experience
that
complaint
is
an
old
one
and
seems
likely
to
prove
unending
though
i
have
already
several
times
stated
the
truth
in
vain
i
shall
not
cease
to
maintain
it
yet
no
man
can
become
or
can
be
unhappy
unless
he
so
chooses
but
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
there
is
in
men
a
certain
perverse
and
dangerous
inclination
to
deceive
themselves
which
is
the
most
deadly
thing
in
life
for
if
it
is
true
that
we
rightly
fear
being
taken
in
by
those
with
whom
we
live
because
our
natural
habit
of
trusting
them
tends
to
make
us
unsuspicious
and
the
pleasantly
familiar
sound
of
their
voice
is
apt
to
put
us
off
our
guard
how
much
rather
ought
you
to
fear
the
deceptions
you
practise
on
yourself
where
love
influence
familiarity
play
so
large
a
part
a
case
wherein
every
one
esteems
himself
more
than
he
deserves
loves
himself
more
than
he
ought
and
where
deceiver
and
deceived
are
one
and
the
same
person
you
have
said
this
kind
of
thing
pretty
often
already
but
i
do
not
recollect
ever
practising
such
deception
on
myself
and
i
hope
other
people
have
not
deceived
me
either
now
at
this
very
moment
you
are
notably
deceiving
yourself
when
you
boast
never
to
have
done
such
a
thing
at
all
and
i
have
a
good
enough
hope
of
your
own
wit
and
talent
to
make
me
think
that
if
you
pay
close
attention
you
will
see
for
yourself
that
no
man
can
fall
into
misery
of
his
own
will
for
on
this
point
our
whole
discussion
rests
i
pray
you
to
think
well
before
answering
and
give
your
closest
attention
and
be
jealous
for
truth
more
than
for
disputation
but
then
tell
me
what
man
in
the
world
was
ever
forced
to
sin
for
the
seers
and
wise
men
require
that
sin
must
be
a
voluntary
action
and
so
rigid
is
their
definition
that
if
this
voluntariness
is
absent
then
the
sin
also
is
not
there
but
without
sin
no
man
is
made
unhappy
as
you
agreed
to
admit
a
few
minutes
ago
i
perceive
that
by
degrees
i
am
getting
away
from
my
proposition
and
am
being
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
the
beginning
of
my
misery
did
arise
from
my
own
will
i
feel
it
is
true
in
myself
and
i
conjecture
the
same
to
be
true
of
others
now
i
beg
you
on
your
part
to
acknowledge
a
certain
truth
also
what
is
it
you
wish
me
to
acknowledge
that
as
it
is
true
no
man
ever
fell
involuntarily
so
this
also
is
true
that
countless
numbers
of
those
who
thus
are
voluntarily
fallen
nevertheless
do
not
voluntarily
remain
so
i
affirm
this
confidently
of
my
own
self
and
i
believe
that
i
have
received
this
for
my
punishment
as
i
would
not
stand
when
i
might
so
now
i
can
not
rise
when
i
would
that
is
indeed
a
wise
and
true
view
to
take
still
as
you
now
confess
you
were
wrong
in
your
first
proposition
so
i
think
you
should
own
you
are
wrong
in
your
second
then
you
would
say
there
is
no
distinction
between
falling
and
remaining
fallen
no
they
are
indeed
different
things
that
is
to
say
different
in
time
but
in
the
nature
of
the
action
and
in
the
mind
of
the
person
concerned
they
are
one
and
the
same
i
see
in
what
knots
you
entangle
me
but
the
wrestler
who
wins
his
victory
by
a
trick
is
not
necessarily
the
stronger
man
though
he
may
be
the
more
practised
it
is
truth
herself
in
whose
presence
we
are
discoursing
to
her
plain
simplicity
is
ever
dear
and
cunning
is
hateful
that
you
may
see
this
beyond
all
doubt
i
will
go
forward
from
this
point
with
all
the
plainness
you
can
desire
you
could
give
me
no
more
welcome
news
tell
me
then
as
it
is
a
question
concerning
myself
by
what
line
of
reasoning
you
mean
to
prove
i
am
unhappy
i
do
not
deny
that
i
am
but
i
deny
that
it
is
with
my
own
consent
i
remain
so
for
on
the
contrary
i
feel
this
to
be
most
hateful
and
the
very
opposite
of
what
i
wish
but
yet
i
can
do
nothing
except
wish
if
only
the
conditions
laid
down
are
observed
i
will
prove
to
you
that
you
are
misusing
words
what
conditions
do
you
mean
and
how
would
you
have
me
use
words
differently
our
conditions
were
to
lay
aside
all
juggling
with
terms
and
to
seek
truth
in
all
plain
simplicity
and
the
words
i
would
have
you
use
are
these
instead
of
saying
you
you
ought
to
say
you
not
there
will
be
no
end
then
to
our
discussion
for
that
is
what
i
never
shall
confess
i
tell
you
i
know
and
you
yourself
are
witness
how
often
i
have
wished
to
and
yet
could
not
rise
what
floods
of
tears
have
i
shed
and
all
to
no
purpose
o
yes
i
have
witnessed
many
tears
but
very
little
will
heaven
is
witness
for
indeed
i
think
no
man
on
this
earth
knows
what
i
have
suffered
and
how
i
have
longed
earnestly
to
rise
if
only
i
might
hush
hush
heaven
and
earth
will
crash
in
ruin
the
stars
themselves
will
fall
to
hell
and
all
harmonious
nature
be
divided
against
itself
sooner
than
truth
who
is
our
judge
can
be
deceived
and
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
that
your
tears
have
often
stung
your
conscience
but
not
changed
your
will
i
wonder
how
many
times
i
must
tell
you
that
it
is
just
this
impossibility
of
change
which
i
bewail
and
i
wonder
how
many
times
i
must
reply
that
it
is
want
of
will
not
want
of
power
which
is
the
trouble
and
yet
i
wonder
not
that
now
you
find
yourself
involved
in
these
perplexities
in
which
in
time
past
i
too
was
tossed
about
when
i
was
beginning
to
contemplate
entering
upon
a
new
way
of
life
i
tore
my
hair
i
beat
my
brow
my
fingers
i
twisted
nervously
i
bent
double
and
held
my
knees
i
filled
the
air
of
heaven
with
most
bitter
sighs
i
poured
out
tears
like
water
on
every
side
yet
nevertheless
i
remained
what
i
was
and
no
other
until
a
deep
meditation
at
last
showed
me
the
root
of
all
my
misery
and
made
it
plain
before
my
eyes
and
then
my
will
after
that
became
fully
changed
and
my
weakness
also
was
changed
in
that
same
moment
to
power
and
by
a
marvellous
and
most
blessed
alteration
i
was
transformed
instantly
and
made
another
man
another
augustine
altogether
the
full
history
of
that
transformation
is
known
if
i
mistake
not
to
you
already
in
my
yes
in
truth
i
know
it
well
and
never
can
i
forget
the
story
of
that
beneath
whose
shade
the
miracle
took
place
well
indeed
may
you
remember
it
and
no
tree
to
you
should
be
more
dear
no
not
the
myrtle
nor
the
ivy
nor
the
laurel
beloved
of
apollo
and
ever
afterwards
favoured
by
all
the
band
of
poets
favoured
too
by
you
above
all
who
alone
in
your
age
have
been
counted
worthy
to
be
crowned
with
its
leaves
yet
dearer
than
these
should
be
to
you
the
memory
of
that
for
it
greets
you
like
some
mariner
coming
into
haven
after
many
storms
it
holds
out
to
you
the
path
of
righteousness
and
a
sure
hope
which
fadeth
not
away
that
presently
the
divine
forgiveness
shall
be
yours
i
would
not
say
one
word
in
contradiction
go
on
i
beseech
you
with
what
you
have
begun
this
is
what
i
undertook
and
will
go
on
with
to
prove
to
you
that
so
far
you
are
like
those
many
others
of
whom
it
may
be
said
in
the
words
of
virgil
unchanged
their
mind
while
vainly
flow
their
tears
though
i
might
multiply
examples
yet
i
will
rather
content
myself
with
this
alone
that
we
might
almost
reckon
as
belonging
to
ourselves
and
so
all
the
more
likely
to
come
home
how
wisely
you
have
made
choice
for
indeed
it
were
useless
to
add
more
and
no
other
could
be
so
deeply
graven
in
my
heart
great
as
the
gulf
which
parts
us
may
be
i
mean
between
you
in
your
safe
haven
and
me
in
peril
of
shipwreck
you
in
felicity
me
in
distress
still
amid
my
winds
and
tempests
i
can
recognise
from
time
to
time
the
traces
of
your
own
passions
so
that
as
often
as
i
read
the
book
of
your
and
am
made
partaker
of
your
conflict
between
two
contrary
emotions
between
hope
and
fear
and
weep
as
i
read
i
seem
to
be
hearing
the
story
of
my
own
self
the
story
not
of
another
wandering
but
of
my
own
therefore
since
now
i
have
put
away
every
inclination
to
mere
dispute
go
on
i
beg
as
you
desire
for
all
my
heart
wishes
now
is
not
to
hinder
but
only
to
follow
where
you
lead
i
make
no
such
demand
on
you
as
that
for
though
a
certain
very
wise
man
has
laid
it
down
that
through
overmuch
contention
truth
is
lost
yet
often
it
happens
that
a
discussion
leads
to
truth
it
is
not
then
expedient
to
accept
everything
advanced
which
is
the
token
of
a
slack
and
sleepy
mind
any
more
than
it
is
expedient
to
set
oneself
to
oppose
a
plain
and
open
truth
which
indicates
only
the
mind
of
one
who
likes
fighting
for
fighting
sake
i
understand
and
agree
with
you
and
will
act
on
your
advice
now
pray
go
on
you
admit
therefore
that
the
argument
is
just
and
the
chain
of
reasoning
valid
when
we
say
that
a
perfect
knowledge
of
misery
will
beget
a
perfect
desire
to
be
rid
of
it
if
only
the
power
to
be
rid
may
follow
the
desire
i
have
professed
that
i
will
believe
you
in
everything
i
feel
there
is
still
something
you
would
like
to
urge
even
now
do
please
confess
it
no
matter
what
it
may
be
nothing
only
that
i
am
much
amazed
i
to
think
i
should
never
yet
have
wished
what
i
have
believed
i
always
wished
you
still
stick
at
that
point
o
well
to
put
an
end
to
this
kind
of
talk
i
will
agree
that
you
have
wished
sometimes
what
then
do
you
not
remember
the
phrase
of
ovid
to
wish
for
what
you
want
is
not
enough
with
ardent
longing
you
must
strive
for
it
i
understand
but
thought
that
was
just
what
i
had
been
doing
you
were
mistaken
well
i
will
believe
so
to
make
your
belief
certain
examine
your
own
conscience
conscience
is
the
best
judge
of
virtue
it
is
a
guide
true
and
unerring
that
weighs
every
thought
and
deed
it
will
tell
you
that
you
have
never
longed
for
spiritual
health
as
you
ought
but
that
considering
what
great
dangers
beset
you
your
wishes
were
but
feeble
and
ineffective
i
have
been
examining
my
conscience
as
you
suggested
what
do
you
find
that
what
you
say
is
true
we
have
made
a
little
progress
if
you
are
beginning
to
be
awake
it
will
soon
be
better
with
you
now
you
acknowledge
it
was
not
well
hitherto
if
it
is
enough
to
acknowledge
i
hope
to
be
able
to
be
not
only
well
but
quite
well
for
never
have
i
understood
more
clearly
that
my
wishes
for
liberty
and
for
an
end
to
my
misery
have
been
too
lukewarm
but
can
it
be
enough
to
desire
only
why
do
you
ask
i
mean
to
desire
without
doing
anything
what
you
propose
is
an
impossibility
no
one
desires
ardently
and
goes
to
sleep
of
what
use
is
desire
then
doubtless
the
path
leads
through
many
difficulties
but
the
desire
of
virtue
is
itself
a
great
part
of
virtue
there
you
give
me
ground
for
good
hope
all
my
discourse
is
just
to
teach
you
how
to
hope
and
to
fear
why
to
fear
then
tell
me
why
to
hope
because
whereas
so
far
i
have
striven
and
with
much
tribulation
merely
not
to
become
worse
you
now
open
a
way
to
me
whereby
i
may
become
better
and
better
even
to
perfection
but
maybe
you
do
not
think
how
toilsome
that
way
is
have
you
some
now
terror
in
store
for
me
to
desire
is
but
one
word
but
how
many
things
go
to
make
it
up
your
words
make
me
tremble
not
to
mention
the
positive
elements
in
desire
it
involves
the
destruction
of
many
other
objects
i
do
not
quite
take
in
your
meaning
the
desire
of
all
good
can
not
exist
without
thrusting
out
every
lower
wish
you
know
how
many
different
objects
one
longs
for
in
life
all
these
you
must
first
learn
to
count
as
nothing
before
you
can
rise
to
the
desire
for
the
chief
good
which
a
man
loves
less
when
along
with
it
he
loves
something
else
that
does
not
minister
to
it
i
recognise
the
thought
how
many
men
are
there
who
have
extinguished
all
their
passions
or
not
to
speak
of
extinguishing
tell
me
how
many
are
there
who
have
subdued
their
spirit
to
the
control
of
reason
and
will
dare
to
say
i
have
no
more
in
common
with
my
body
all
that
once
seemed
so
pleasing
to
me
is
become
poor
in
my
sight
i
aspire
now
to
joys
of
nobler
nature
such
men
are
rare
indeed
and
now
i
understand
what
those
difficulties
are
with
which
you
threatened
me
when
all
these
passions
are
extinguished
then
and
not
till
then
will
desire
be
full
and
free
for
when
the
soul
is
uplifted
on
one
side
to
heaven
by
its
own
nobility
and
on
the
other
dragged
down
to
earth
by
the
weight
of
the
flesh
and
the
seductions
of
the
world
so
that
it
both
desires
to
rise
and
also
to
sink
at
one
and
the
same
time
then
drawn
contrary
ways
you
find
you
arrive
nowhither
what
then
would
you
say
a
man
must
do
for
his
soul
to
break
the
fetters
of
the
world
and
mount
up
perfect
and
entire
to
the
realms
above
what
leads
to
this
goal
is
as
i
said
in
the
first
instance
the
practice
of
meditation
on
death
and
the
perpetual
recollection
of
our
mortal
nature
unless
i
am
deceived
there
is
no
man
alive
who
is
more
often
revolving
this
thought
in
his
heart
than
i
ah
here
is
another
delusion
a
fresh
obstacle
in
your
way
what
do
you
mean
to
say
i
am
once
more
lying
i
would
sooner
hear
you
use
more
civil
language
but
to
say
the
same
thing
yes
to
say
nothing
else
so
then
you
mean
i
care
nothing
at
all
about
death
to
tell
the
truth
you
think
very
seldom
of
it
and
in
so
feeble
a
way
that
your
thought
never
touches
the
root
of
your
trouble
i
supposed
just
the
opposite
i
am
not
concerned
with
what
you
suppose
but
with
what
you
ought
to
suppose
well
i
may
tell
you
that
in
spite
of
that
i
will
suppose
it
no
more
if
you
prove
to
me
that
my
supposition
was
a
false
one
that
i
will
do
easily
enough
provided
you
are
willing
to
admit
the
truth
in
good
faith
for
this
end
i
will
call
in
a
witness
who
is
not
far
away
and
who
may
that
be
pray
your
conscience
she
testifies
just
the
contrary
when
you
make
an
obscure
confused
demand
no
witness
can
give
precise
or
clear
answers
what
has
that
to
do
with
the
subject
i
would
like
to
know
much
every
way
to
see
dearly
listen
well
no
man
is
so
senseless
unless
he
be
altogether
out
of
his
mind
as
never
once
to
remember
his
own
weak
nature
or
who
if
asked
the
question
whether
he
were
mortal
and
dwelt
in
a
frail
body
would
not
answer
that
he
was
the
pains
of
the
body
the
onsets
of
fever
attest
the
fact
and
whom
has
the
favour
of
heaven
made
exempt
moreover
your
friends
are
carried
out
to
their
burial
before
your
eyes
and
this
fills
the
soul
with
dread
when
one
goes
to
the
graveside
of
some
friend
of
one
own
age
one
is
forced
to
tremble
at
another
fall
and
to
begin
feeling
uneasy
for
oneself
just
as
when
you
see
your
neighbour
roof
on
fire
you
can
not
fool
quite
happy
for
your
own
because
as
horace
puts
it
on
your
own
head
you
see
the
stroke
will
fall
the
impression
will
be
more
strong
in
case
you
see
some
sudden
death
carry
off
one
younger
more
vigorous
finer
looking
than
yourself
in
such
an
event
a
man
will
say
this
one
seemed
to
live
secure
and
yet
he
is
snatched
off
his
youth
his
beauty
his
strength
have
brought
him
no
help
what
god
or
what
magician
has
promised
me
any
surer
warrant
of
security
verily
i
too
am
mortal
when
the
like
fate
befalls
kings
and
rulers
of
the
earth
people
of
great
might
and
such
as
are
regarded
with
awe
those
who
see
it
are
struck
with
more
dread
are
more
shaken
with
alarm
they
are
amazed
when
they
behold
a
sudden
terror
or
perchance
hours
of
intense
agony
seize
on
one
who
was
wont
to
strike
terror
into
others
from
what
other
cause
proceed
the
doings
of
people
who
seem
beside
themselves
upon
the
death
of
men
in
highest
place
such
as
to
take
an
instance
from
history
the
many
things
of
this
kind
that
as
you
have
related
were
done
at
the
funeral
of
julius
cæsar
a
public
spectacle
like
this
strikes
the
attention
and
touches
the
heart
of
mortal
men
and
what
then
they
see
in
the
case
of
another
is
brought
home
as
pertaining
also
to
themselves
beside
all
these
are
there
not
the
rage
of
savage
boasts
and
of
men
and
the
furious
madness
of
war
are
there
not
the
falls
of
those
great
buildings
which
as
some
one
neatly
says
are
first
the
safeguards
then
the
sepulchres
of
men
are
there
not
malignant
motions
of
the
air
beneath
some
evil
star
and
pestilential
sky
and
so
many
perils
on
sea
and
land
that
look
wheresoever
you
will
you
can
not
turn
your
gaze
anywhither
but
you
will
meet
the
visible
image
and
memento
of
your
own
mortality
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
can
not
wait
any
longer
for
as
for
having
my
reason
fortified
i
do
not
think
any
more
powerful
aid
can
be
brought
than
the
many
arguments
you
have
adduced
as
i
listened
i
wondered
what
end
you
were
aiming
at
and
when
your
discourse
would
finish
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
have
interrupted
me
and
it
has
not
yet
reached
its
end
however
here
is
the
conclusion
although
a
host
of
little
play
upon
the
surface
of
your
mind
nothing
yet
has
penetrated
the
centre
the
miserable
heart
is
hardened
by
long
habit
and
becomes
like
some
indurated
stone
impervious
to
warnings
however
salutary
you
will
find
few
people
considering
with
any
seriousness
the
fact
that
they
will
die
then
few
people
are
aware
of
the
very
definition
of
man
which
nevertheless
is
so
hackneyed
in
the
schools
that
it
ought
not
merely
to
weary
the
ears
of
those
who
hear
it
but
is
now
long
since
scrawled
upon
the
walls
and
pillars
of
every
room
this
prattling
of
the
dialecticians
will
never
come
to
an
end
it
throws
up
summaries
and
definitions
like
bubbles
matter
indeed
for
endless
controversies
but
for
the
most
part
they
know
nothing
of
the
real
truth
of
the
things
they
talk
about
so
if
you
ask
one
of
this
set
of
men
for
a
definition
of
a
man
or
of
anything
else
they
have
their
answer
quite
pat
as
the
saying
goes
if
you
press
him
further
he
will
lie
low
or
if
by
sheer
practice
in
arguing
he
has
acquired
a
certain
boldness
and
power
of
speech
the
very
tone
of
the
man
will
tell
you
he
possesses
no
real
knowledge
of
the
thing
he
sets
out
to
define
the
best
way
of
dealing
with
this
brood
with
their
studied
air
of
carelessness
and
empty
curiosity
is
to
launch
at
their
head
some
such
invective
as
this
you
wretched
creatures
why
this
everlasting
labour
for
nothing
this
expense
of
wit
on
silly
subtleties
why
in
total
oblivion
of
the
real
basis
of
things
will
you
grow
old
simply
conversant
with
words
and
with
whitening
hair
and
wrinkled
brow
spend
all
your
time
in
babyish
babble
heaven
grant
that
your
foolishness
hurt
no
one
but
yourselves
and
do
as
little
harm
as
possible
to
the
excellent
minds
and
capacities
of
the
young
i
agree
that
nothing
half
severe
enough
can
be
said
of
this
monstrous
perversion
of
learning
but
let
me
remind
you
that
your
zeal
of
denunciation
has
so
carried
you
away
that
you
have
omitted
to
finish
your
definition
of
man
i
thought
i
had
explained
sufficiently
but
i
will
be
more
explicit
still
man
is
an
animal
or
rather
the
chief
of
all
animals
the
veriest
rustic
knows
that
much
every
schoolboy
could
tell
you
also
if
you
asked
him
that
man
is
moreover
a
rational
animal
and
that
he
is
mortal
this
definition
then
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
no
it
is
not
those
who
are
acquainted
with
it
are
very
few
in
number
how
so
when
you
can
find
a
man
so
governed
by
reason
that
all
his
conduct
is
regulated
by
her
all
his
appetites
subject
to
her
alone
a
man
who
has
so
mastered
every
motion
of
his
spirit
by
reason
curb
that
he
knows
it
is
she
alone
who
distinguishes
him
from
the
savagery
of
the
brute
and
that
it
is
only
by
submission
to
her
guidance
that
he
deserves
the
name
of
man
at
all
when
you
have
found
one
so
convinced
of
his
own
mortality
as
to
have
that
always
before
his
eyes
always
to
be
ruling
himself
by
it
and
holding
perishable
things
in
such
light
esteem
that
he
ever
sighs
after
that
life
which
reason
always
foresaw
wherein
mortality
shall
be
cast
away
when
you
have
found
such
a
man
then
you
may
say
that
he
has
some
true
and
fruitful
idea
of
what
the
definition
of
man
is
this
definition
of
which
we
were
speaking
i
said
it
was
given
to
few
men
to
know
and
to
reflect
upon
as
the
nature
of
the
truth
requires
hitherto
i
had
believed
i
was
of
that
number
i
have
no
doubt
that
when
you
turn
over
in
your
mind
the
many
things
you
have
learned
whether
in
the
school
of
experience
or
in
your
reading
of
books
the
thought
of
death
has
several
times
entered
your
head
but
still
it
has
not
sunk
down
into
your
heart
as
deeply
as
it
ought
nor
is
it
lodged
there
as
firmly
as
it
should
be
what
do
you
call
sinking
down
into
my
heart
though
i
think
i
understand
i
would
like
you
to
explain
more
clearly
this
is
what
i
mean
every
one
knows
and
the
greatest
philosophers
are
of
the
same
opinion
that
of
all
tremendous
realities
death
is
the
most
tremendous
so
true
is
this
that
from
ever
of
old
its
very
name
is
terrible
and
dreadful
to
hear
yet
though
so
it
is
it
will
not
do
that
we
hear
that
name
but
lightly
or
allow
the
remembrance
of
it
to
slip
quickly
from
our
mind
no
we
must
take
time
to
realise
it
we
must
meditate
with
attention
thereon
we
must
picture
to
ourselves
the
effect
of
death
on
each
several
part
of
our
bodily
frame
the
cold
extremities
the
breast
in
the
sweat
of
fever
the
side
throbbing
with
pain
the
vital
spirits
running
slower
and
slower
as
death
draws
near
the
eyes
sunken
and
weeping
every
look
filled
with
tears
the
forehead
pale
and
drawn
the
cheeks
hanging
and
hollow
the
teeth
staring
and
discoloured
the
nostrils
shrunk
and
sharpened
the
lips
foaming
the
tongue
foul
and
motionless
the
palate
parched
and
dry
the
languid
head
and
panting
breast
the
hoarse
murmur
and
sorrowful
sigh
the
evil
smell
of
the
whole
body
the
horror
of
seeing
the
face
utterly
unlike
itself
all
these
things
will
come
to
mind
and
so
to
speak
be
ready
to
one
hand
if
one
recalls
what
one
has
seen
in
any
close
observation
of
some
deathbed
where
it
has
fallen
to
our
lot
to
attend
for
things
seen
cling
closer
to
our
remembrance
than
things
heard
and
moreover
it
is
not
without
a
profound
instinct
of
wisdom
that
in
certain
religious
orders
of
the
stricter
kind
the
custom
has
survived
even
down
to
our
own
time
though
i
do
not
think
it
makes
for
good
character
altogether
of
allowing
the
members
to
watch
the
bodies
of
the
dead
being
washed
and
put
in
shrouds
for
their
burial
while
the
stern
professors
of
the
rule
stand
by
in
order
that
this
sad
and
pitiful
spectacle
thrust
forsooth
beneath
their
very
eyes
may
admonish
their
remembrance
continually
and
affright
the
minds
of
those
who
survive
from
every
hope
of
this
transitory
world
this
then
is
what
i
meant
by
sinking
down
deeply
into
the
soul
perchance
you
never
name
the
name
of
death
that
so
you
may
fall
in
with
the
custom
of
the
time
although
nothing
is
more
certain
than
the
fact
or
more
uncertain
than
the
hour
yet
in
daily
converse
you
must
often
speak
of
things
connected
with
it
only
they
soon
fly
out
of
mind
and
leave
no
trace
i
follow
your
counsel
the
more
readily
because
now
i
recognise
much
in
your
words
that
i
have
myself
revolved
in
my
own
breast
but
please
if
you
think
it
well
will
you
impress
some
mark
on
my
memory
which
will
act
as
a
warning
to
me
and
prevent
me
from
this
time
henceforth
from
telling
lies
to
myself
and
fondling
my
own
mistakes
for
this
it
seems
to
me
is
what
turns
men
from
the
right
way
that
they
dream
they
have
already
reached
the
goal
and
make
therefore
no
effort
any
more
i
like
to
hear
you
speak
so
your
words
are
those
of
a
man
alert
and
watchful
who
will
not
bear
to
be
idle
and
trust
to
chance
so
here
is
a
test
which
will
never
play
you
false
every
time
you
meditate
on
death
without
the
least
sign
of
motion
know
that
you
have
meditated
in
vain
as
about
any
ordinary
topic
but
if
in
the
act
of
meditation
you
find
yourself
suddenly
grow
stiff
if
you
tremble
turn
pale
and
feel
as
if
already
you
endured
its
pains
if
at
the
same
time
you
seem
to
yourself
as
if
you
were
leaving
your
body
behind
and
were
forced
to
render
up
your
account
before
the
bar
of
eternal
judgment
of
all
the
words
and
deeds
of
your
past
life
nothing
omitted
or
passed
over
that
nothing
any
more
is
to
be
hoped
for
from
good
looks
or
worldly
position
nothing
from
eloquence
or
riches
or
power
if
you
realise
that
this
judge
takes
no
bribe
and
that
all
things
are
naked
and
open
in
his
sight
that
death
itself
will
not
turn
aside
for
any
plea
that
it
is
not
the
end
of
sufferings
but
only
a
passage
if
you
picture
to
yourself
a
thousand
forms
of
punishment
and
pain
the
noise
and
wailing
of
hell
the
sulphurous
rivers
the
thick
darkness
and
avenging
furies
in
a
word
the
fierce
malignity
everywhere
of
that
dark
abode
and
what
is
the
climax
of
its
horror
that
the
misery
knows
no
end
and
despair
thereof
itself
is
everlasting
since
the
time
of
god
mercy
is
passed
by
if
i
say
all
these
things
rise
up
before
your
eyes
at
once
not
as
fictions
but
as
truth
not
as
being
possible
but
inevitable
and
of
a
surety
bound
to
come
yes
and
even
now
at
the
door
and
if
you
think
on
these
things
not
lightly
nor
with
desperation
but
full
of
hope
in
god
and
that
his
strong
right
hand
is
able
and
ready
to
pluck
you
out
of
so
great
calamities
if
you
but
show
yourself
willing
to
be
healed
and
wishful
to
be
raised
up
if
you
cleave
to
your
purpose
and
persist
in
your
endeavour
then
you
may
be
assured
you
have
not
meditated
in
vain
i
will
not
deny
you
have
terrified
me
greatly
by
putting
so
huge
a
mass
of
suffering
before
my
eyes
but
may
god
give
me
such
plenteous
mercy
as
that
i
may
steep
my
thought
in
meditations
like
these
not
only
day
by
day
but
more
especially
at
night
when
the
mind
with
all
its
daily
interests
laid
aside
relaxes
and
is
wont
to
return
upon
itself
when
i
lay
my
body
down
as
those
who
die
and
my
shrinking
mind
imagines
the
hour
itself
with
all
its
horrors
is
at
hand
so
intently
do
i
conceive
it
all
as
though
i
were
in
the
very
agony
of
dying
that
i
shall
seem
to
be
already
in
the
place
of
torment
beholding
what
you
speak
of
and
every
kind
of
anguish
and
so
stricken
shall
i
be
at
that
sight
so
terrified
and
affrighted
that
i
shall
rise
up
i
know
it
before
my
horrified
household
and
cry
aloud
what
am
i
doing
what
suffering
is
this
for
what
miserable
destruction
is
fate
keeping
me
alive
jesu
by
thy
mercy
thou
whom
none
yet
hath
conquered
succour
me
give
thy
right
hand
to
me
in
misery
through
the
dark
waves
o
bear
me
up
with
thee
that
dying
i
may
rest
and
be
in
peace
many
other
things
shall
i
say
to
myself
as
one
in
a
fever
whose
mind
every
chance
impression
carries
hither
and
thither
in
his
fear
and
then
i
go
talking
strangely
to
my
friends
weeping
and
making
them
weep
and
then
presently
after
this
we
shall
return
to
what
we
were
before
and
since
these
things
are
so
what
is
it
i
ask
which
holds
me
back
what
little
hidden
obstacle
is
there
which
makes
it
come
to
pass
that
hitherto
all
these
meditations
avail
nothing
but
to
bring
me
troubles
and
terrors
and
i
continue
the
same
man
that
i
have
ever
been
the
same
it
may
be
as
men
to
whom
no
reflections
like
these
have
ever
come
yet
am
i
more
miserable
than
they
for
they
whatever
may
be
their
latter
end
enjoy
at
least
the
pleasures
of
the
present
time
but
as
for
me
i
know
not
either
what
my
end
will
be
and
i
taste
no
pleasure
that
is
not
poisoned
with
these
embittering
thoughts
vex
not
yourself
i
pray
you
when
you
ought
rather
to
rejoice
the
more
the
sinner
feels
pleasure
in
his
sin
the
more
unhappy
should
we
think
him
and
the
more
in
need
of
pity
i
suppose
you
mean
that
a
man
whose
pleasures
are
uninterrupted
comes
to
forget
himself
and
is
never
led
back
into
virtue
path
but
that
he
who
amid
his
carnal
delights
is
sometime
visited
with
adversity
will
come
to
the
recollection
of
his
true
condition
just
in
proportion
as
he
finds
fickle
and
wayward
pleasure
desert
him
if
both
kind
of
life
had
one
and
the
same
end
i
do
not
see
why
he
should
not
be
counted
the
happier
who
enjoys
the
present
time
and
puts
off
affliction
to
another
day
rather
than
the
man
who
neither
enjoys
the
present
nor
looks
for
any
joy
hereafter
unless
you
are
perhaps
moved
by
this
consideration
that
in
the
end
the
laughter
of
the
former
will
be
changed
to
more
bitter
tears
yes
much
more
bitter
for
i
have
often
noticed
that
if
a
man
throws
away
the
rein
of
reason
altogether
and
in
the
most
excessive
pleasure
of
all
this
is
commonly
the
case
his
fall
is
more
dangerous
than
that
of
the
man
who
may
come
rushing
down
from
the
same
height
but
keeps
still
some
hold
though
feebly
on
the
reins
but
before
all
else
i
attach
importance
to
what
you
said
before
that
in
the
case
of
the
one
there
is
some
hope
of
his
conversion
but
in
that
of
the
other
nothing
remains
but
despair
yes
that
is
my
view
also
in
the
meanwhile
however
have
you
not
forgotten
my
first
question
what
was
it
concerning
what
keeps
me
back
i
asked
you
why
i
am
the
only
one
to
whom
the
profound
meditation
on
death
that
you
said
was
so
full
of
benefit
brings
no
good
whatever
in
the
first
place
it
is
perhaps
because
you
look
on
death
as
something
remote
whereas
when
one
thinks
how
very
short
life
is
and
how
many
divers
kinds
of
accidents
befall
it
you
ought
not
to
think
death
is
far
away
what
deludes
almost
all
of
us
as
cicero
says
is
that
we
regard
death
from
afar
off
some
correctors
i
would
prefer
to
call
them
corruptors
of
the
text
have
wished
to
change
the
reading
by
inserting
a
negative
before
the
verb
and
have
maintained
that
he
ought
to
have
said
we
do
not
regard
death
from
afar
off
for
the
rest
there
is
no
one
in
his
senses
who
does
not
see
death
one
way
or
another
and
in
reality
cicero
word
means
to
see
from
afar
the
one
thing
that
makes
so
many
people
suffer
illusion
in
their
ideas
on
death
is
that
they
are
wont
to
forecast
for
their
own
life
some
limit
which
is
indeed
possible
according
to
nature
but
at
which
nevertheless
very
few
arrive
hardly
any
one
in
fact
dies
of
whom
the
poet
line
might
not
be
quoted
grey
hairs
and
length
of
years
he
for
himself
expected
the
fault
may
touch
you
nearly
for
your
age
your
vigorous
constitution
and
temperate
way
of
life
perchance
have
fostered
a
like
hope
in
your
heart
please
do
not
suspect
that
of
me
god
keep
me
from
such
madness
as
in
that
monster
false
to
put
my
trust
if
i
may
borrow
the
words
virgil
puts
in
the
mouth
of
his
famous
pilot
palinurus
for
i
too
am
cast
upon
a
wide
ocean
cruel
and
full
of
storms
i
sail
across
its
angry
waves
and
struggle
with
the
wind
and
the
little
boat
i
steer
shivers
and
seems
to
be
letting
in
the
water
in
every
part
i
know
well
she
can
not
hold
out
for
long
and
i
see
i
have
no
hope
at
all
of
safety
unless
the
almighty
pity
put
forth
his
strong
right
hand
and
guide
my
vessel
rightly
ere
it
be
too
late
and
bring
me
to
shore
so
that
i
who
have
lived
upon
the
waters
may
die
in
port
of
this
i
think
i
should
have
a
good
hope
because
it
has
never
been
my
lot
to
put
any
confidence
in
those
riches
and
power
on
which
i
see
so
many
of
my
contemporaries
yes
and
older
men
as
well
relying
for
what
folly
would
it
be
to
pass
all
one
life
in
toil
and
poverty
and
care
heaping
up
riches
just
to
die
at
last
and
have
no
time
to
enjoy
them
so
then
in
truth
i
regard
this
dark
shadow
of
death
not
as
something
afar
off
but
very
nigh
and
ever
at
the
doors
and
i
have
not
forgotten
a
certain
little
verse
i
wrote
in
my
youth
at
the
end
of
a
letter
to
a
friend
while
we
speak
along
a
thousand
ways
with
stealthy
steps
up
to
our
very
door
death
creeps
if
i
could
say
words
like
these
at
that
time
of
life
what
shall
i
say
now
that
i
am
more
advanced
in
age
and
more
experienced
in
what
life
is
for
everything
i
see
or
hear
or
feel
or
think
seems
unless
i
deceive
myself
connected
in
my
mind
with
that
last
end
and
yet
the
question
still
remains
what
is
it
that
holds
me
back
give
humble
thanks
to
god
who
so
regards
you
and
guides
you
with
his
merciful
rein
and
so
pricks
you
with
his
spur
it
is
not
surely
possible
that
he
who
thus
has
the
thought
of
death
before
him
day
by
day
should
ever
be
doomed
to
death
eternal
but
since
you
feel
and
rightly
so
that
something
still
is
wanting
i
will
try
and
unfold
to
you
what
it
is
and
if
god
so
please
remove
it
also
to
the
end
that
you
may
arise
and
with
free
uplifted
mind
shake
off
that
old
bondage
that
so
long
has
kept
you
down
o
would
that
indeed
you
may
prove
able
so
to
help
me
and
i
on
my
part
be
capable
of
receiving
such
a
boon
it
shall
be
yours
if
you
wish
the
thing
is
not
impossible
but
in
the
nature
of
man
actions
two
things
are
required
and
if
either
be
wanting
the
action
will
come
to
nought
there
must
be
will
and
that
will
must
be
so
strong
and
earnest
that
it
can
deserve
the
name
of
purpose
so
let
it
be
do
you
know
what
stands
in
the
way
of
your
purpose
of
heart
that
is
what
i
want
to
know
what
for
so
long
i
have
earnestly
desired
to
understand
then
listen
it
was
from
heaven
your
soul
came
forth
never
will
i
assert
a
lower
origin
than
that
but
in
its
contact
with
the
flesh
wherein
it
is
imprisoned
it
has
lost
much
of
its
first
splendour
have
no
doubt
of
this
in
your
mind
and
not
only
is
it
so
but
by
reason
of
the
length
of
time
it
has
in
a
manner
fallen
asleep
and
if
one
may
so
express
it
forgotten
its
own
beginning
and
its
heavenly
creator
and
these
passions
that
are
born
in
the
soul
through
its
connection
with
the
body
and
that
forgetfulness
of
its
nobler
nature
seem
to
me
to
have
been
touched
by
virgil
with
pen
almost
inspired
when
he
writes
the
souls
of
men
still
shine
with
heavenly
fire
that
tells
from
whence
they
come
save
that
the
flesh
and
limbs
of
earth
breed
dullness
hence
spring
fears
desire
and
grief
and
pleasures
of
the
world
and
so
in
darkness
prisoned
they
no
more
look
upward
to
heaven
face
do
you
not
in
the
poet
words
discern
that
monster
with
four
heads
so
deadly
to
the
nature
of
man
i
discern
very
clearly
the
fourfold
passion
of
our
nature
which
first
of
all
we
divide
in
two
as
it
has
respect
to
past
and
future
and
then
subdivide
again
in
respect
of
good
and
evil
and
so
by
these
four
winds
distraught
the
rest
and
quietness
of
man
soul
is
perished
and
gone
you
discern
rightly
and
the
words
of
the
apostle
are
fulfilled
in
us
which
say
the
corruptible
body
presseth
down
the
soul
and
the
earthly
tabernacle
weigheth
down
the
mind
that
museth
upon
many
things
of
a
truth
the
countless
forms
and
images
of
things
visible
that
one
by
one
are
brought
into
the
soul
by
the
senses
of
the
body
gather
there
in
the
inner
centre
in
a
mass
and
the
soul
not
being
akin
to
these
or
capable
of
learning
them
they
weigh
it
down
and
overwhelm
it
with
their
contrariety
hence
that
plague
of
too
many
impressions
tears
apart
and
wounds
the
thinking
faculty
of
the
soul
and
with
its
fatal
distracting
complexity
bars
the
way
of
clear
meditation
whereby
it
would
mount
up
to
the
threshold
of
the
one
chief
good
you
have
spoken
admirably
of
that
plague
in
many
places
and
especially
in
your
book
on
with
which
it
is
indeed
quite
incompatible
it
was
but
the
other
day
that
i
lighted
on
that
work
of
yours
in
one
of
my
digressions
from
the
study
of
philosophy
and
poetry
and
it
was
with
very
great
eagerness
that
i
began
to
peruse
it
indeed
i
was
like
a
man
setting
out
from
his
own
country
to
see
the
world
and
coming
to
the
gate
of
some
famous
city
quite
new
to
him
where
charmed
by
the
novelty
of
all
around
he
stops
now
here
now
there
and
looks
intently
on
all
that
meets
his
gaze
and
yet
in
that
book
allowing
for
a
difference
of
phraseology
such
as
becomes
a
teacher
of
catholic
truth
you
will
find
a
large
part
of
its
doctrine
is
drawn
from
philosophers
more
especially
from
those
of
the
platonist
and
socratic
school
and
to
keep
nothing
from
you
i
may
say
that
what
especially
moved
me
to
undertake
that
work
was
a
word
of
your
favourite
cicero
god
blessed
that
work
of
mine
so
that
from
a
few
seeds
there
came
an
abundant
harvest
but
let
us
come
back
to
the
matter
in
hand
as
you
wish
but
o
best
of
fathers
do
not
hide
from
me
what
that
word
was
which
gave
you
the
of
so
excellent
a
work
it
was
the
passage
where
in
a
certain
book
cicero
says
by
way
of
expressing
his
detestation
of
the
errors
of
his
time
they
could
look
at
nothing
with
their
mind
but
judged
everything
by
the
sight
of
their
eyes
yet
a
man
of
any
greatness
of
understanding
is
known
by
his
detaching
his
thought
from
objects
of
sense
and
his
meditations
from
the
ordinary
track
in
which
others
move
this
then
i
took
as
my
foundation
and
built
upon
it
the
work
which
you
say
has
given
you
pleasure
i
remember
the
place
it
is
in
the
i
have
been
delighted
to
notice
what
a
habit
it
is
of
yours
to
quote
those
words
here
and
elsewhere
in
your
works
and
they
deserve
it
for
they
are
words
that
seem
to
blend
in
one
phrase
truth
and
dignity
and
grace
now
since
it
seems
good
to
you
pray
return
to
our
subject
this
then
is
that
plague
that
has
hurt
you
this
is
what
will
quickly
drive
you
to
destruction
unless
you
take
care
overwhelmed
with
too
many
divers
impressions
made
on
it
and
everlastingly
fighting
with
its
own
cares
your
weak
spirit
is
crushed
so
that
it
has
not
strength
to
judge
what
it
should
first
attack
or
to
discern
what
to
cherish
what
to
destroy
what
to
repel
all
its
strength
and
what
time
the
niggard
hand
of
fate
allows
are
not
sufficient
for
so
many
demands
so
it
suffers
that
same
evil
which
befalls
those
who
sow
too
many
seeds
in
one
small
space
of
ground
as
they
spring
up
they
choke
each
other
so
in
your
overcrowded
mind
what
there
is
sown
can
make
no
root
and
bear
no
fruit
with
no
considered
plan
you
are
tossed
now
here
now
there
in
strange
fluctuation
and
can
never
put
your
whole
strength
to
anything
hence
it
happens
that
whenever
the
generous
mind
approaches
if
it
is
allowed
the
contemplation
of
death
or
some
other
meditation
that
might
help
it
in
the
path
of
life
and
penetrates
by
its
own
acumen
to
the
depths
of
its
own
nature
it
is
unable
to
stand
there
and
driven
by
hosts
of
various
cares
it
starts
back
and
then
the
work
that
promised
so
well
and
seemed
so
good
flags
and
grows
unsteady
and
there
comes
to
pass
that
inward
discord
of
which
we
have
said
so
much
and
that
worrying
torment
of
a
mind
angry
with
itself
when
it
loathes
its
own
defilements
yet
cleanses
them
not
away
sees
the
crooked
paths
yet
does
not
forsake
them
dreads
the
impending
danger
yet
stirs
not
a
step
to
avoid
it
ah
woe
is
me
now
you
have
probed
my
wound
to
the
quick
there
is
the
seat
of
my
pain
from
there
i
fear
my
death
will
come
it
is
well
you
are
awakening
to
life
but
as
we
have
now
prolonged
our
discussion
enough
for
let
us
if
you
will
defer
the
rest
until
and
let
us
take
a
breathing
space
in
silence
yes
i
am
tired
somewhat
and
most
gladly
shall
i
welcome
quiet
and
rest

you

hear
if
you
feel
now
in

heart
and
confidence
for
when
a
man
has
been
ill
a
hopeful
spirit
in
him
is
no
small
sign
of
returning
health
what
hope
i
have
is
no
whit
in
myself
god
is
my
hope
it
is
wisely
spoken
and
now
i
return
to
our
theme
many
things
are
against
you
many
temptations
assail
but
you
yourself
still
seem
ignorant
both
of
their
numbers
and
their
strength
and
what
in
warfare
generally
happens
to
one
who
from
a
distance
sees
some
closely
marshalled
battalion
has
happened
to
you
such
a
man
is
often
deceived
into
thinking
his
foes
fewer
in
number
than
they
are
but
when
they
draw
nearer
when
they
have
deployed
their
serried
ranks
before
his
eyes
in
all
their
martial
pomp
then
his
fears
soon
increase
and
he
repents
him
of
his
boldness
so
likewise
will
it
be
with
you
when
i
shall
display
before
your
eyes
on
this
side
and
on
that
all
the
evils
that
are
pressing
upon
you
and
hemming
you
in
from
every
quarter
you
will
be
ashamed
of
your
own
boldness
you
will
be
sorry
you
were
so
and
begin
to
bewail
that
in
its
sore
straits
your
soul
has
been
unable
to
break
through
the
wedged
phalanx
of
your
foes
you
will
discover
presently
how
many
foolish
fancies
of
too
easy
victory
you
have
let
come
into
your
mind
excluding
that
wholesome
dread
to
which
i
am
endeavouring
to
bring
you
indeed
you
make
me
horribly
afraid
that
my
danger
was
great
i
have
always
been
aware
and
now
in
spite
of
this
you
tell
me
i
have
very
much
it
and
indeed
that
compared
with
what
they
should
be
my
fears
have
been
nothing
at
all
what
hope
have
i
then
left
it
is
never
time
to
despair
be
sure
of
that
despair
is
the
very
last
and
worst
of
evils
and
therefore
i
would
have
you
make
it
a
first
principle
to
put
it
away
wholly
i
knew
the
truth
of
the
maxim
but
in
my
dread
forgot
it
at
the
moment
now
give
me
all
your
attention
look
and
listen
while
i
recall
words
of
your
favourite
seer
behold
what
foemen
gather
round
your
walls
and
at
your
gates
make
sharp
their
gleaming
sword
to
murder
you
and
yours
look
what
snares
the
world
spreads
for
you
what
vanities
it
dangles
before
your
eyes
what
vain
cares
it
has
to
weigh
you
down
to
begin
at
the
beginning
consider
what
made
those
most
noble
spirits
among
all
creatures
fall
into
the
abyss
of
ruin
and
take
heed
lest
in
like
manner
you
also
fall
after
them
all
your
forethought
all
your
care
will
be
needed
to
save
you
from
this
danger
think
how
many
temptations
urge
your
mind
to
perilous
and
soaring
flights
they
make
you
dream
of
nobleness
and
forget
your
frailty
they
choke
your
faculties
with
fumes
of
until
you
think
of
nothing
else
they
lead
you
to
wax
so
proud
and
confident
in
your
own
strength
that
at
length
you
hate
your
creator
so
you
live
for
and
imagine
that
great
things
are
what
you
deserve
whereas
if
you
had
a
truer
remembrance
great
blessings
ought
to
make
you
not
proud
but
humble
when
you
realise
that
they
came
to
you
for
no
merit
of
your
own
what
need
for
me
to
speak
of
the
eternal
lord
god
when
even
to
earthly
lords
men
feel
their
minds
more
humbly
bound
if
they
experience
any
bounty
of
theirs
which
they
are
conscious
of
being
undeserved
do
we
not
see
them
striving
to
merit
afterwards
what
they
feel
they
should
have
earned
before
now
let
your
mind
realise
as
it
easily
can
on
what
paltry
grounds
your
pride
is
set
up
you
trust
in
your
intellect
you
boast
of
what
eloquence
much
reading
has
given
you
you
take
pleasure
in
the
beauty
of
your
mortal
body
yet
do
you
not
feel
that
in
many
things
your
intellect
fails
you
are
there
not
many
things
in
which
you
can
not
rival
the
skill
of
the
humblest
of
mankind
nay
might
i
not
go
further
and
without
mentioning
mankind
may
i
not
say
that
with
all
your
labour
and
study
you
will
find
yourself
no
match
in
skill
for
some
of
the
meanest
and
smallest
of
god
creatures
will
you
boast
then
of
intellect
after
that
and
as
for
reading
what
has
it
profited
you
of
the
multitude
of
things
you
have
perused
how
many
have
remained
in
your
mind
how
many
have
struck
root
and
borne
fruit
in
due
season
search
well
your
heart
and
you
will
find
that
the
whole
of
what
you
know
is
but
like
a
little
shrunken
stream
dried
by
the
summer
heat
compared
to
the
mighty
ocean
and
of
what
relevance
is
it
to
know
a
multitude
of
things
suppose
you
shall
have
learned
all
the
circuits
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
the
spaces
of
the
sea
the
courses
of
the
stars
the
virtues
of
herbs
and
stones
the
secrets
of
nature
and
then
be
ignorant
of
yourself
of
what
profit
is
it
if
by
the
help
of
scripture
you
shall
have
discovered
the
right
and
upward
path
what
use
is
it
if
wrath
and
passion
make
you
swerve
aside
into
the
crooked
downward
way
supposing
you
shall
have
learned
by
heart
the
deeds
of
illustrious
men
of
all
the
ages
of
what
profit
will
it
be
if
you
yourself
day
by
day
care
not
what
you
do
what
need
for
me
to
speak
of
eloquence
will
not
you
yourself
readily
confess
how
often
the
putting
any
confidence
in
this
has
proved
vain
and
moreover
what
boots
it
that
others
shall
approve
what
you
have
said
if
in
the
court
of
your
own
conscience
it
stands
condemned
for
though
the
applause
of
those
who
hear
you
may
seem
to
yield
a
certain
fruit
which
is
not
to
be
despised
yet
of
what
worth
is
it
after
all
if
in
his
heart
the
speaker
himself
is
not
able
to
applaud
how
petty
is
the
pleasure
that
comes
from
the
plaudits
of
the
multitude
and
how
can
a
man
soothe
and
flatter
others
unless
he
first
soothe
and
flatter
himself
therefore
you
will
easily
understand
how
often
you
are
deluded
by
that
glory
you
hope
for
from
your
eloquence
and
how
your
pride
therein
rests
but
upon
a
foundation
of
wind
for
what
can
be
more
childish
nay
might
i
not
say
more
insane
than
to
waste
time
and
trouble
over
matters
where
all
the
things
themselves
are
worthless
and
the
words
about
them
vain
what
worse
folly
than
to
go
on
blind
to
one
real
defects
and
be
infatuated
with
words
and
the
pleasure
of
hearing
one
own
voice
like
those
little
birds
they
tell
of
who
are
so
ravished
with
the
sweetness
of
their
own
song
that
they
sing
themselves
to
death
and
furthermore
in
the
common
affairs
of
life
does
it
not
often
happen
to
you
to
find
yourself
put
to
the
blush
to
discover
that
in
the
use
of
words
you
are
no
match
even
for
some
whom
you
think
are
very
inferior
men
consider
also
how
in
nature
there
are
many
things
for
which
names
are
altogether
wanting
and
many
more
to
which
names
have
indeed
been
given
but
to
express
the
beauty
of
them
as
you
know
by
experience
words
are
altogether
inadequate
how
often
have
i
heard
you
lament
how
often
seen
you
dumb
and
dissatisfied
because
neither
your
tongue
nor
your
pen
could
sufficiently
utter
ideas
which
nevertheless
to
your
reflecting
mind
were
very
clear
and
intelligible
what
then
is
this
eloquence
so
limited
and
so
weak
which
is
neither
able
to
compass
and
bring
within
its
scope
all
the
things
that
it
would
nor
yet
to
hold
fast
even
those
things
that
it
has
compassed
the
greeks
reproach
you
and
you
in
turn
the
greeks
with
having
a
paucity
of
words
seneca
it
is
true
accounts
their
vocabulary
the
richer
but
cicero
at
the
beginning
of
his
treatise
the
distinctions
of
good
and
makes
the
following
declaration
i
can
not
enough
marvel
whence
should
arise
that
insolent
scorn
of
our
national
literature
though
this
is
not
the
place
to
discuss
it
yet
i
will
express
my
conviction
which
i
have
often
maintained
not
only
that
the
latin
tongue
is
not
poor
as
it
is
the
fashion
to
assert
but
that
it
is
in
fact
richer
than
the
greek
and
as
he
frequently
repeats
elsewhere
the
same
opinion
so
especially
in
the
he
exclaims
thou
greek
that
countest
thyself
rich
in
words
how
poor
art
thou
in
phrases
this
is
the
saying
mark
you
of
one
who
know
quite
well
that
he
was
the
prince
of
latin
oratory
and
had
already
shown
that
he
was
not
afraid
to
challenge
greece
for
the
palm
of
literary
glory
let
me
add
that
seneca
so
notable
an
admirer
of
the
greek
tongue
says
in
his
all
that
roman
eloquence
can
bring
forward
to
rival
or
excel
the
pride
of
greece
is
connected
with
the
name
of
cicero
a
magnificent
tribute
but
unquestionably
true
there
is
then
as
you
see
on
the
subject
of
the
primacy
in
eloquence
a
very
great
controversy
not
only
between
you
and
the
greeks
but
among
our
own
most
learned
writers
themselves
there
are
in
our
camp
those
who
hold
for
the
greeks
and
it
may
be
among
them
there
are
some
who
hold
for
us
if
at
least
we
may
judge
from
what
is
reported
of
the
illustrious
philosopher
plutarch
in
a
word
seneca
who
is
ours
while
doing
all
justice
to
cicero
gives
his
final
verdict
for
the
greeks
notwithstanding
that
cicero
is
of
the
contrary
opinion
as
to
my
own
opinion
on
the
question
in
debate
i
consider
that
both
parties
to
the
controversy
have
some
truth
on
their
side
when
they
accuse
both
latin
and
greek
of
poverty
of
words
and
if
this
judgment
be
correct
in
regard
to
two
such
famous
languages
what
hope
is
there
for
any
other
bethink
you
therefore
what
sort
of
confidence
you
can
have
in
your
own
simple
powers
when
the
whole
resources
of
that
people
of
which
you
are
but
a
little
part
are
adjudged
poor
and
how
ashamed
you
should
be
to
have
spent
so
much
time
in
pursuing
something
which
can
not
be
attained
and
which
if
it
could
be
would
prove
after
all
but
vanity
itself
i
will
pass
on
to
other
points
are
you
perhaps
inclined
to
plume
yourself
on
your
physical
advantages
but
think
what
a
thread
they
hang
upon
what
is
it
you
are
most
pleased
with
in
this
way
is
it
your
good
health
and
strength
but
truly
nothing
is
more
frail
it
is
proved
by
the
fatigue
you
suffer
from
even
little
things
the
various
maladies
to
which
the
body
is
liable
the
stings
of
insects
a
slight
draught
of
air
and
a
thousand
other
such
small
vexations
all
tell
the
same
tale
will
you
perchance
be
taken
in
by
your
own
face
and
when
you
behold
in
the
glass
your
smooth
complexion
and
comely
features
are
you
minded
to
be
smitten
entranced
charmed
the
story
of
narcissus
has
no
warning
for
you
and
content
with
gazing
only
at
the
outward
envelope
of
the
body
you
consider
not
that
the
eyes
of
the
mind
tell
you
how
vile
and
plain
it
is
within
moreover
if
you
had
no
other
warning
the
stormy
course
of
life
itself
which
every
day
robs
you
of
something
ought
to
show
you
how
transient
and
perishing
that
flower
of
beauty
is
and
if
perhaps
which
you
will
hardly
dare
affirm
you
fancy
yourself
invincible
by
age
by
illness
and
whatever
else
may
change
the
grace
of
bodily
form
you
have
at
least
not
forgotten
that
last
enemy
which
destroys
all
and
you
will
do
well
to
engrave
in
your
inmost
heart
and
mind
this
word
of
the
satirist
is
death
alone
compels
us
all
to
see
what
little
things
we
are
here
unless
i
am
mistaken
are
the
causes
that
inflate
your
mind
with
pride
forbid
you
to
recognise
your
low
estate
and
keep
you
from
the
recollection
of
death
but
others
there
still
are
that
i
now
propose
to
pass
in
review
stop
a
little
i
beg
you
lest
overwhelmed
by
the
weight
of
so
many
reproaches
i
have
no
strength
or
spirit
to
reply
by
all
means
say
on
gladly
will
i
hold
my
peace
you
have
astonished
me
not
a
little
by
casting
in
my
teeth
a
multitude
of
things
of
which
i
am
perfectly
sure
they
have
never
entered
my
head
at
all
you
allege
that
i
trusted
in
my
own
intelligence
but
surely
the
one
sign
i
have
given
of
possessing
some
little
intelligence
is
that
never
have
i
counted
on
that
faculty
at
all
shall
i
pride
myself
on
much
reading
of
books
which
with
a
little
wisdom
has
brought
me
a
thousand
anxieties
how
can
you
say
i
have
sought
the
glory
of
eloquence
i
who
as
you
yourself
acknowledged
a
moment
ago
am
wont
above
all
things
to
complain
that
speech
is
inadequate
to
my
thoughts
unless
you
wish
to
try
and
prove
the
contrary
i
may
say
that
you
know
i
am
always
conscious
of
my
own
littleness
and
that
if
by
chance
i
have
ever
thought
myself
to
be
anything
such
a
thought
has
come
but
rarely
and
then
only
from
seeing
the
ignorance
of
other
men
for
as
i
often
remark
we
are
reduced
to
acknowledge
according
to
cicero
celebrated
phrase
that
what
powers
we
may
possess
come
rather
from
the
feebleness
of
others
than
from
any
merit
in
ourselves
but
even
were
i
endowed
as
richly
as
you
imagine
with
those
advantages
of
which
you
speak
what
is
there
so
magnificent
about
them
that
i
should
be
vain
i
am
surely
not
so
forgetful
of
myself
nor
so
as
to
let
myself
trouble
about
cares
of
that
sort
for
what
use
in
the
world
are
intellect
knowledge
eloquence
if
they
can
bring
no
healing
to
a
soul
diseased
i
remember
having
given
expression
already
in
one
of
my
letters
to
my
sad
sense
of
this
truth
as
to
what
you
remarked
with
an
air
of
quasi
gravity
about
my
physical
advantages
i
must
confess
it
makes
me
smile
that
i
of
all
men
should
be
thought
to
have
plumed
myself
on
my
mortal
and
perishing
body
when
every
day
of
my
life
i
feel
in
it
the
ravages
of
time
at
work
heaven
save
me
from
such
folly
i
will
not
deny
that
in
the
days
of
my
youth
i
took
some
care
to
trim
my
head
and
to
adorn
my
face
but
the
taste
for
that
kind
of
thing
has
gone
with
my
early
years
and
i
recognise
now
the
truth
of
that
saying
of
the
emperor
domitian
who
writing
of
himself
in
a
letter
to
a
lady
friend
and
complaining
of
the
too
swift
decay
of
the
goodliness
of
man
said
know
you
that
nothing
is
so
sweet
but
nothing
also
is
so
fleeting
as
the
beauty
of
the
body
it
would
be
an
easy
task
to
refute
all
you
have
advanced
but
i
prefer
that
your
own
conscience
should
send
the
shaft
of
shame
to
your
heart
rather
than
words
of
mine
i
will
not
labour
the
point
or
draw
the
truth
from
you
by
torture
but
as
those
who
take
revenge
magnanimously
i
will
merely
prefer
a
simple
request
that
you
will
continue
to
avoid
what
you
profess
you
have
hitherto
avoided
if
by
any
chance
the
fashion
of
your
countenance
should
at
any
time
have
stirred
the
least
motion
of
conceit
then
i
beg
you
to
reflect
what
soon
those
bodily
members
must
become
though
now
they
please
your
eye
think
how
their
destiny
is
to
be
foul
and
hideous
and
what
repulsion
they
would
cause
even
in
yourself
were
you
able
to
see
them
then
then
call
often
to
mind
this
maxim
of
the
philosopher
i
was
born
for
some
higher
destiny
than
to
be
the
slave
of
my
body
assuredly
it
is
the
very
climax
of
folly
to
see
men
neglect
their
real
selves
in
order
to
cosset
the
body
and
limbs
in
which
they
dwell
if
a
man
is
imprisoned
for
a
little
while
in
some
dungeon
dark
damp
and
dirty
would
he
not
seem
to
have
lost
his
senses
if
he
did
not
shield
himself
as
far
as
he
was
able
from
any
contact
with
the
walls
and
soil
and
with
the
expectation
of
freedom
would
he
not
eagerly
listen
for
the
footsteps
of
his
deliverer
but
if
giving
up
that
expectation
covered
with
filth
and
plunged
in
darkness
he
dreads
to
leave
his
prison
if
he
turns
all
his
attention
to
painting
and
adorning
the
walls
which
shut
him
in
in
a
vain
endeavour
to
counteract
the
nature
of
his
dripping
will
he
not
rightly
be
counted
a
wretched
fool
well
you
yourself
know
and
love
your
wretched
that
you
are
and
on
the
very
eve
of
your
issuing
or
being
dragged
therefrom
you
chain
yourself
more
firmly
in
it
labouring
to
adorn
what
you
ought
to
despise
if
you
would
follow
the
advice
you
yourself
had
tendered
to
the
father
of
the
great
scipio
in
your
poem
called
the
bonds
and
fetters
known
and
suffered
long
the
clogs
on
liberty
are
hateful
to
us
and
the
new
freedom
now
attained
we
love
wonderful
is
it
if
you
made
others
give
the
counsel
which
you
yourself
refuse
but
i
can
not
disguise
from
you
one
word
in
your
discourse
which
to
you
may
seem
very
humble
but
to
me
seems
full
of
pride
and
arrogance
i
am
sorry
if
i
have
in
any
way
expressed
myself
arrogantly
but
if
the
spirit
is
the
true
rule
of
one
deeds
and
words
then
my
own
bears
me
witness
that
i
intended
nothing
in
that
sense
to
depreciate
others
is
a
kind
of
pride
more
intolerable
than
to
exalt
oneself
above
one
due
measure
i
would
much
rather
see
you
exalt
others
and
then
put
yourself
above
them
than
degrade
all
the
world
in
a
heap
at
your
feet
and
by
a
refinement
of
pride
fashion
for
yourself
a
shield
of
humanity
out
of
scorn
for
your
neighbour
take
it
how
you
will
i
profess
but
small
esteem
either
for
others
or
myself
i
am
ashamed
to
tell
you
what
experience
has
made
me
think
of
the
majority
of
mankind
it
is
very
prudent
to
despise
oneself
but
it
is
very
dangerous
and
very
useless
to
despise
others
however
let
us
proceed
are
you
aware
of
what
still
makes
you
turn
from
the
right
way
pray
say
anything
you
like
only
do
not
accuse
me
of
envy
please
god
may
pride
have
done
you
as
little
hurt
as
envy
so
far
as
i
judge
you
have
escaped
this
sin
but
i
have
others
whereof
to
accuse
you
still
you
will
not
vex
me
whatever
reproaches
you
may
bring
tell
me
freely
everything
that
leads
me
astray
the
desire
of
things
temporal
come
come
i
truly
have
never
heard
anything
so
absurd
there
you
see
everything
vexes
you
you
have
forgotten
your
promise
this
is
not
however
any
question
of
envy
no
but
of
cupidity
and
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
man
in
the
world
more
free
of
this
fault
than
myself
you
are
great
at
but
believe
me
you
are
not
so
clear
of
this
fault
as
you
think
you
are
what
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
i
am
not
free
from
the
reproach
of
cupidity
i
do
and
that
you
are
likewise
guilty
of
ambition
go
on
me
more
still
double
your
reproaches
make
full
proof
of
your
work
of
an
accuser
i
wonder
what
fresh
blow
you
have
in
store
for
me
what
is
mere
truth
and
right
testimony
you
call
accusation
and
the
satirist
was
quite
right
who
wrote
to
speak
the
truth
to
men
is
to
accuse
and
the
saying
of
the
comic
poet
is
equally
true
is
flattery
makes
friends
and
candour
foes
but
tell
me
pray
what
is
the
use
of
this
irritation
and
anger
that
makes
you
so
on
edge
was
it
necessary
in
a
life
so
short
to
weave
such
long
hopes
have
no
long
hopes
life
shortness
cries
to
man
you
read
that
often
enough
but
take
no
count
of
it
you
will
reply
i
suppose
that
you
do
this
from
a
tender
solicitude
for
your
friends
and
so
find
a
fair
pretext
for
your
error
but
what
madness
it
is
under
pretext
of
friendship
to
others
to
declare
war
on
yourself
and
treat
yourself
as
an
enemy
i
am
neither
covetous
nor
inhuman
enough
to
be
without
solicitude
for
my
friends
especially
for
those
whose
virtue
or
deserts
attach
me
to
them
for
it
is
those
whom
i
admire
revere
love
and
compassionate
but
on
the
other
hand
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
generous
enough
to
court
my
own
ruin
for
the
sake
of
my
friends
what
i
desire
is
so
to
manage
my
affairs
as
to
have
a
decent
subsistence
while
i
live
and
as
you
have
delivered
a
shot
at
me
from
horace
let
me
also
from
the
same
poet
put
up
a
shield
in
and
profess
my
desire
is
the
same
as
his
let
me
have
books
and
stores
for
one
year
hence
nor
make
my
life
one
flutter
of
suspense
and
further
how
i
shape
my
course
so
that
i
may
in
the
same
words
pass
my
old
age
and
not
my
honour
lose
and
if
i
may
still
serve
the
lyric
muse
let
me
own
also
that
i
dread
very
much
the
rocks
ahead
if
life
should
be
prolonged
and
so
would
provide
beforehand
for
this
double
wish
of
mine
to
blend
with
my
work
for
the
muses
some
simpler
occupation
in
household
affairs
but
this
i
do
with
such
indifference
that
it
is
plain
enough
i
only
descend
to
such
necessities
because
i
am
so
obliged
i
see
clearly
how
these
pretexts
texts
which
serve
as
an
excuse
for
your
folly
have
penetrated
deeply
into
your
very
spirit
how
is
it
then
you
have
not
engraved
equally
deeply
in
your
heart
the
words
of
the
satirist
why
keep
such
hoarded
gold
to
vex
the
mind
why
should
such
madness
still
delude
mankind
to
scrape
through
life
on
water
and
dry
bread
that
you
may
have
a
fortune
when
you
dead
undoubtedly
it
is
more
because
you
think
that
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
die
in
a
of
purple
and
rest
in
a
marble
tomb
and
leave
to
your
heirs
the
business
of
disputing
over
a
great
succession
than
that
you
yourself
care
for
the
money
which
wins
such
advantages
it
is
a
futile
trouble
believe
me
and
quite
devoid
of
good
sense
if
you
will
steadily
observe
human
nature
you
will
discover
that
in
a
general
way
it
is
content
with
very
little
and
in
your
case
particularly
there
is
hardly
a
man
who
needs
less
for
his
satisfaction
unless
you
had
been
blinded
by
prejudices
doubtless
the
poet
was
thinking
of
the
average
run
of
men
or
possibly
his
own
actual
self
when
he
said
my
sorry
fare
is
dogwood
fruit
i
pluck
wild
herbs
and
roots
that
in
the
fields
do
grow
and
a
few
berries
but
unlike
him
you
will
acknowledge
yourself
that
such
a
mode
of
life
is
far
from
sorry
and
that
in
fact
nothing
would
be
pleasanter
if
you
were
to
consult
only
your
own
taste
and
not
the
customs
of
a
deluded
world
why
then
continue
to
torment
yourself
if
you
order
your
life
as
your
nature
dictates
you
were
rich
long
ago
but
you
never
will
be
able
to
be
rich
if
you
follow
the
standard
of
the
world
you
will
always
think
something
wanting
and
in
after
it
you
will
find
yourself
swept
away
by
your
passion
do
you
remember
with
what
delight
you
used
to
wander
in
the
depth
of
the
country
sometimes
laying
yourself
down
on
a
bed
of
turf
you
would
listen
to
the
water
of
a
brook
murmuring
over
the
stones
at
another
time
seated
on
some
open
hill
you
would
let
your
eye
wander
freely
over
the
plain
stretched
at
your
feet
at
others
again
you
enjoyed
a
sweet
slumber
beneath
the
shady
trees
of
some
valley
in
the
noontide
heat
and
revelled
in
the
delicious
silence
never
idle
in
your
soul
you
would
ponder
over
some
high
meditation
with
only
the
muses
for
your
friends
you
were
never
less
alone
than
when
in
their
company
and
then
like
the
old
man
in
virgil
who
reckoned
himself
as
rich
askings
when
at
the
close
of
day
home
to
his
cot
he
took
his
happy
way
and
on
his
table
spread
his
simple
fare
fresh
from
the
meadow
without
cost
or
care
you
would
come
at
sunset
back
to
your
humble
roof
and
contented
with
your
good
things
did
you
not
find
yourself
the
richest
and
happiest
of
mortal
men
ah
i
recall
it
all
now
and
the
remembrance
of
that
time
makes
me
sigh
with
regret
why
why
do
you
speak
of
sighing
and
who
pray
is
the
author
of
your
woes
it
is
indeed
your
own
spirit
and
none
other
which
too
long
has
not
dared
to
follow
the
true
law
of
its
nature
and
has
thought
itself
a
prisoner
only
because
it
would
not
break
its
chain
even
now
it
is
dragging
you
along
like
a
runaway
horse
and
unless
you
tighten
the
rein
it
will
rush
you
to
destruction
ever
since
you
grew
tired
of
your
leafy
trees
of
your
simple
way
of
life
and
society
of
country
people
egged
on
by
cupidity
you
have
plunged
once
more
into
the
midst
of
the
tumultuous
life
of
cities
i
read
in
your
face
and
speech
what
a
happy
and
peaceful
life
you
lived
for
what
miseries
have
you
not
endured
since
then
too
rebellious
against
the
teachings
of
experience
you
still
hesitate
it
is
without
a
doubt
the
bonds
of
your
own
sins
that
keep
you
back
and
god
allows
that
as
you
passed
your
childhood
under
a
harsh
muster
so
though
you
once
became
free
you
have
again
fallen
into
bondage
and
there
will
end
your
miserable
old
age
verily
i
was
at
your
side
once
when
quite
young
unstained
by
avarice
or
ambition
you
gave
promise
of
becoming
a
great
man
now
alas
having
quite
changed
your
character
the
nearer
you
get
to
the
end
of
your
journey
the
more
you
trouble
yourself
about
provisions
for
the
way
what
remains
then
but
that
you
will
be
found
when
the
day
comes
for
you
to
die
and
it
may
be
even
now
at
hand
and
certainly
can
not
be
any
great
way
off
you
will
be
found
i
say
still
hungering
after
gold
poring
over
the
calendar
for
those
anxious
cares
which
increase
day
after
day
must
by
necessity
at
last
have
grown
to
a
huge
figure
and
a
prodigious
amount
well
after
all
if
i
foresee
the
poverty
of
old
age
and
gather
some
provision
against
that
time
of
weariness
what
is
there
so
much
to
find
fault
with
ah
ludicrous
anxiety
and
tragic
neglect
to
worry
and
trouble
yourself
about
a
time
at
which
you
may
never
arrive
and
in
which
you
assuredly
will
not
have
long
to
stay
and
yet
to
be
quite
oblivious
of
that
end
at
which
you
can
not
help
arriving
and
of
which
there
is
no
remedy
when
you
once
have
reached
it
but
such
is
your
execrable
habit
to
care
for
what
temporal
and
be
careless
for
all
that
eternal
as
for
this
delusion
of
providing
a
shield
against
old
age
no
doubt
what
put
it
into
your
head
was
the
verse
in
virgil
which
speaks
of
the
ant
who
dreads
a
destitute
old
age
and
so
you
have
made
an
ant
your
mentor
and
you
are
as
excusable
as
the
satiric
poet
who
wrote
some
people
like
the
ant
fear
hunger
and
cold
but
if
you
are
going
to
put
no
limit
to
the
following
of
ants
you
will
discover
that
there
is
nothing
more
melancholy
and
nothing
more
absurd
than
to
ward
off
poverty
one
day
by
loading
yourself
with
it
all
your
days
what
will
you
say
next
do
you
counsel
me
to
court
poverty
i
have
no
longing
for
it
but
i
will
bear
it
with
courage
if
fortune
who
delights
to
overturn
human
affairs
reduces
me
to
it
my
opinion
is
that
in
every
condition
man
should
aim
at
the
golden
mean
i
would
not
then
restrict
you
to
the
rules
of
those
who
say
all
that
is
needed
for
man
life
is
bread
and
water
with
these
none
is
poor
whosoever
desires
no
more
than
these
will
rival
in
felicity
the
father
of
the
gods
no
i
do
not
tie
man
life
down
to
dry
bread
and
water
such
maxims
are
as
extreme
as
they
are
troublesome
and
odious
to
listen
to
also
in
regard
to
your
infirmity
what
i
enjoin
is
not
to
natural
appetite
but
to
control
it
what
you
already
have
would
be
sufficient
for
your
wants
if
you
had
known
how
to
be
sufficient
to
yourself
but
as
it
is
you
are
yourself
the
cause
of
your
own
poverty
to
heap
up
riches
is
to
heap
up
cares
and
anxieties
this
truth
has
been
proved
so
continually
that
there
is
no
need
to
bring
more
arguments
what
a
strange
delusion
what
a
melancholy
blindness
of
the
soul
of
man
whose
nature
is
so
noble
whose
birth
is
from
above
that
it
will
neglect
all
that
is
lofty
and
debase
itself
to
care
for
the
metals
of
the
earth
every
time
you
have
been
drawn
by
these
hooks
of
cupidity
you
come
down
from
your
high
meditations
to
these
grovelling
thoughts
and
do
you
not
feel
each
time
as
if
hurled
from
heaven
to
earth
from
the
bosom
of
the
stars
to
a
bottomless
pit
of
blackness
yes
in
truth
i
feel
it
and
one
knows
not
how
to
express
what
i
have
suffered
in
my
fall
why
then
are
you
not
afraid
of
a
danger
you
have
so
often
experienced
and
when
you
were
raised
up
to
the
higher
life
why
did
you
not
attach
yourself
to
it
more
firmly
i
make
all
the
efforts
i
can
to
do
so
but
inasmuch
as
the
various
exigencies
of
our
human
lot
shake
and
unsettle
me
i
am
torn
away
in
spite
of
myself
it
is
not
without
reason
i
imagine
that
the
poets
of
antiquity
dedicated
the
double
peaks
of
parnassus
to
two
different
divinities
they
desired
to
beg
from
apollo
whom
they
called
the
god
of
genius
the
interior
resources
of
the
mind
and
from
bacchus
a
plentiful
supply
of
external
goods
way
of
regarding
it
is
suggested
to
me
not
only
by
the
teaching
of
experience
but
by
the
frequent
testimony
of
wise
men
whom
i
need
not
quote
to
you
moreover
although
the
plurality
of
deities
may
be
ridiculous
this
opinion
of
the
poets
is
not
devoid
of
common
sense
and
in
referring
a
like
twofold
supplication
to
the
one
god
from
whom
all
good
comes
down
i
do
not
think
i
can
be
called
unreasonable
unless
indeed
you
hold
otherwise
i
deny
not
you
are
right
in
your
view
but
the
poor
way
you
divide
your
time
stirs
my
indignation
you
had
already
devoted
your
whole
life
to
honourable
work
if
anything
compelled
you
to
spend
any
of
your
time
on
other
occupations
you
regarded
it
as
lost
but
i
now
you
only
concede
to
what
is
good
and
beautiful
the
moments
you
can
spare
from
avarice
any
man
in
the
world
would
desire
to
reach
old
age
on
such
terms
as
that
but
what
limit
or
check
would
be
to
such
a
state
of
mind
choose
for
yourself
some
defined
goal
and
when
you
have
attained
it
then
stay
there
and
breathe
awhile
doubtless
you
know
that
the
saying
i
am
about
to
quote
is
from
lips
of
man
but
has
all
the
force
of
a
divine
oracle
the
miser
voice
for
ever
cries
give
give
then
curb
your
lusts
if
you
would
wisely
live
neither
to
want
nor
to
abound
neither
to
command
others
or
obey
them
there
you
have
my
heart
wish
then
you
must
drop
your
humanity
and
become
god
if
you
would
want
nothing
can
you
be
ignorant
that
of
all
the
creatures
man
is
the
one
that
has
most
wants
many
a
time
have
i
heard
that
said
but
i
would
still
like
to
hear
it
afresh
from
your
lips
and
lodge
it
in
my
remembrance
behold
him
naked
and
unformed
born
in
wailings
and
tears
comforted
with
a
few
drops
of
milk
trembling
and
crawling
needing
the
hand
of
another
fed
and
clothed
from
the
beasts
of
the
field
his
body
feeble
his
spirit
restless
subject
to
all
kinds
of
sickness
the
prey
of
passions
innumerable
devoid
of
reason
joyful
sorrowful
in
both
full
of
agitation
incapable
of
mastering
himself
unable
to
restrain
his
appetite
ignorant
of
what
things
are
useful
to
him
and
in
what
proportion
knowing
not
how
to
control
himself
in
meat
or
drink
forced
with
great
labour
to
gain
the
food
that
other
creatures
find
ready
at
their
need
made
dull
with
sleep
swollen
with
food
stupefied
with
drink
emaciated
with
watching
famished
with
hunger
parched
with
thirst
at
once
greedy
and
timid
disgusted
with
what
he
has
longing
after
what
he
has
lost
discontented
alike
with
past
present
and
future
full
of
pride
in
his
misery
and
aware
of
his
frailty
baser
than
the
vilest
worms
his
life
is
short
his
days
uncertain
his
fate
inevitable
since
death
in
a
thousand
forms
is
waiting
for
him
at
last
you
have
so
piled
up
his
miseries
and
beggary
that
i
feel
it
were
good
if
i
had
never
been
born
yet
in
the
midst
of
such
wretchedness
and
such
deep
destitution
of
good
in
man
estate
you
go
on
dreaming
of
riches
and
power
such
as
neither
emperors
nor
kings
have
ever
fully
enjoyed
kindly
tell
me
who
ever
made
use
of
those
words
who
spoke
either
of
riches
or
of
power
you
imply
both
for
what
greater
riches
can
there
be
than
to
lack
nothing
what
greater
power
than
to
be
independent
of
every
one
else
in
the
world
certainly
those
kings
and
masters
of
the
earth
whom
you
think
so
rich
have
wanted
a
multitude
of
things
the
generals
of
great
armies
depend
on
those
whom
they
seem
to
command
and
kept
in
check
by
their
armed
legions
they
find
the
very
soldiers
who
render
them
invincible
also
render
them
in
turn
helpless
give
up
therefore
your
dreams
of
the
impossible
and
be
content
to
accept
the
lot
of
humanity
learn
to
live
in
want
and
in
abundance
to
command
and
to
obey
without
desiring
with
those
ideas
of
yours
to
shake
off
the
yoke
of
fortune
that
presses
even
on
kings
you
will
only
be
free
from
this
yoke
when
caring
not
a
straw
for
human
passions
you
bend
your
neck
wholly
to
the
rule
of
virtue
then
you
will
be
free
wanting
nothing
then
you
will
be
independent
in
a
word
then
you
will
be
a
king
truly
powerful
and
perfectly
happy
now
i
do
indeed
repent
for
all
that
is
past
and
i
desire
nothing
but
i
am
still
in
bondage
to
one
evil
habit
and
am
conscious
always
of
a
certain
need
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
well
to
come
back
to
our
subject
there
is
the
very
thing
which
keeps
you
back
from
the
contemplation
of
death
it
is
that
which
makes
you
harassed
with
earthly
anxieties
you
do
not
lift
up
your
heart
at
all
to
higher
things
if
you
will
take
my
counsel
you
will
utterly
cast
away
these
anxieties
which
are
as
so
many
dead
weights
upon
the
spirit
and
you
will
find
that
it
is
not
so
hard
after
all
to
order
your
life
by
your
nature
and
let
that
rule
and
govern
you
more
than
the
foolish
opinions
of
the
crowd
i
will
do
so
very
willingly
but
may
i
ask
you
to
finish
what
you
were
beginning
to
say
about
ambition
which
i
have
long
desired
to
hear
why
ask
me
to
do
what
you
can
quite
well
do
for
yourself
examine
your
own
heart
you
will
see
that
among
its
other
faults
it
is
not
ambition
which
holds
the
least
place
there
it
has
profited
me
nothing
then
to
have
fled
from
towns
whenever
i
could
to
have
thought
scorn
of
the
world
and
public
affairs
to
have
gone
into
the
recesses
of
the
woods
and
silence
of
the
fields
to
have
proved
my
aversion
from
empty
honours
if
still
i
am
to
be
accused
of
ambition
you
renounce
many
things
well
all
you
mortal
men
but
not
so
much
because
you
despise
them
as
because
you
despair
of
getting
them
hope
and
desire
inflame
each
other
by
the
mutual
stings
of
those
passions
so
that
when
the
one
grows
cold
the
other
dies
away
and
when
one
gets
warm
the
other
boils
over
why
then
should
i
not
hope
was
i
quite
destitute
of
any
accomplishment
i
am
not
now
speaking
of
your
accomplishments
but
certainly
you
had
not
those
by
help
of
which
especially
in
the
present
day
men
mount
to
high
places
i
mean
the
art
of
ingratiating
yourself
in
the
palaces
of
the
great
the
trick
of
flattery
deceit
promising
lying
pretending
dissembling
and
putting
up
with
all
kinds
of
slights
and
indignities
devoid
of
these
accomplishments
and
others
of
the
kind
and
seeing
clearly
that
you
could
not
overcome
nature
you
turned
your
steps
elsewhere
and
you
acted
wisely
and
with
prudence
for
as
cicero
expresses
it
to
contend
against
the
gods
as
did
the
giants
what
is
it
but
to
make
war
with
nature
itself
farewell
such
honours
as
these
if
they
have
to
be
sought
by
such
means
your
words
are
golden
but
you
have
not
convinced
me
of
your
innocence
for
you
do
not
assert
your
indifference
to
honours
so
much
as
to
the
vexations
their
pursuit
involves
like
the
man
who
pretended
he
did
not
want
to
see
rome
because
he
really
would
not
endure
the
trouble
of
the
journey
thither
observe
you
have
not
yet
desisted
from
the
pursuit
of
honour
as
you
seem
to
believe
and
as
you
try
to
persuade
me
but
leave
off
trying
to
hide
behind
your
finger
as
the
saying
goes
all
your
thoughts
all
your
actions
are
plain
before
my
eyes
and
when
you
boast
of
having
fled
from
cities
and
become
enamoured
of
the
woods
i
see
no
real
excuse
but
only
a
shifting
of
your
culpability
we
travel
many
ways
to
the
same
end
and
believe
me
though
you
have
left
the
road
worn
by
feet
of
the
crowd
you
still
direct
your
feet
by
a
towards
this
same
ambition
that
you
say
you
have
thought
scorn
of
it
is
repose
solitude
a
total
disregard
of
human
affairs
yes
and
your
own
activities
also
which
just
at
present
take
you
along
that
chosen
path
but
the
end
and
object
is
glory
you
drive
me
into
a
corner
whence
i
think
however
i
could
manage
to
escape
but
as
the
time
is
short
and
we
must
discriminate
between
many
things
let
us
proceed
if
you
have
no
objection
follow
me
then
as
i
go
forward
we
will
say
nothing
of
gourmandising
for
which
you
have
no
more
inclination
than
a
harmless
pleasure
in
an
occasional
meeting
with
a
few
friends
at
the
hospitable
board
but
i
have
no
fear
for
you
on
this
score
for
when
the
country
has
regained
its
denizen
now
snatched
away
to
the
towns
these
temptations
will
disappear
in
a
moment
and
i
have
noticed
and
have
pleasure
in
acknowledging
that
when
you
are
alone
you
live
in
such
a
simple
way
as
to
surpass
your
friends
and
neighbours
in
frugality
and
temperance
i
leave
on
one
side
anger
also
though
you
often
get
carried
away
by
it
more
than
is
reasonable
yet
at
the
same
time
thanks
to
your
sweet
natural
temperament
you
commonly
control
the
motions
of
your
spirit
and
recall
the
advice
of
horace
anger
a
kind
of
madness
though
not
long
master
the
passion
since
it
very
strong
and
if
you
rule
it
not
it
will
rule
you
so
put
the
curb
on
quickly
that
saying
of
the
poet
and
other
words
of
philosophy
like
it
have
helped
me
a
little
i
own
but
what
has
helped
me
above
all
is
the
thought
of
the
shortness
of
life
what
insensate
folly
to
spend
in
hating
and
hurting
our
the
few
days
we
pass
among
them
soon
enough
the
last
day
of
all
will
arrive
which
will
quite
extinguish
this
flame
in
human
breasts
and
put
an
end
to
all
our
hatred
and
if
we
have
desired
for
any
of
them
nothing
worse
than
death
our
evil
wish
will
soon
be
fulfilled
why
then
seek
to
take
one
life
or
that
of
others
why
let
pass
unused
the
better
part
of
a
time
so
short
when
the
days
are
hardly
long
enough
for
honest
joys
of
this
life
and
for
meditating
on
that
which
is
to
come
no
matter
what
economy
of
time
we
practise
what
good
is
there
in
robbing
any
of
them
of
their
right
and
needful
use
and
turning
them
to
instruments
of
sorrow
and
death
for
ourselves
and
others
this
reflection
has
helped
me
when
i
found
myself
under
any
temptation
to
anger
not
to
fall
utterly
under
its
dominion
or
if
i
fell
has
helped
me
quickly
to
recover
but
hitherto
i
have
not
been
able
quite
to
arm
myself
at
all
points
from
some
little
gusts
of
irritation
as
i
am
not
afraid
that
this
wind
of
anger
will
cause
you
to
make
shipwreck
of
yourself
or
others
i
agree
willingly
that
without
paying
attention
to
the
promises
of
the
stoics
who
set
out
to
extirpate
root
and
branch
all
the
maladies
of
the
soul
you
content
yourself
with
the
milder
treatment
of
the
peripatetics
leaving
then
on
one
side
for
the
moment
these
particular
failings
i
hasten
to
treat
of
others
more
dangerous
than
these
and
against
which
you
will
need
to
be
on
guard
with
more
care
gracious
heaven
what
is
yet
to
come
that
is
more
dangerous
still
well
has
the
sin
of
lust
never
touched
you
with
its
flames
yes
indeed
at
times
so
fiercely
us
to
make
me
mourn
sorely
that
i
was
not
born
without
feelings
i
would
sooner
have
been
a
senseless
stone
than
be
tormented
by
so
many
stings
of
the
flesh
ah
there
is
that
which
turns
you
most
aside
from
the
thought
of
things
divine
for
what
does
the
doctrine
of
the
heavenly
plato
show
but
that
the
soul
must
separate
itself
far
from
the
passion
of
the
flesh
and
tread
down
its
imaginings
before
it
can
rise
pure
and
free
to
the
contemplation
of
the
mystery
of
the
divine
for
otherwise
the
thought
of
its
mortality
will
make
it
cling
to
those
seducing
charms
you
know
what
i
mean
and
you
have
learned
this
truth
in
plato
writings
to
the
study
of
which
you
said
not
long
ago
you
had
given
yourself
up
with
ardour
yes
i
own
i
had
given
myself
to
studying
him
with
great
hopefulness
and
desire
but
the
novelty
of
a
strange
language
and
the
sudden
departure
of
my
teacher
cut
short
my
purpose
for
the
rest
this
doctrine
of
which
you
speak
is
very
well
known
to
me
from
your
own
writings
and
those
of
the
platonists
it
matters
little
from
whom
you
learned
the
truth
though
it
is
a
fact
that
the
authority
of
a
great
master
will
often
have
a
profound
influence
yes
in
my
own
case
i
must
confess
i
feel
profoundly
the
influence
of
a
man
of
whom
cicero
in
his
made
this
remark
which
has
remained
graven
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
when
plato
vouchsafes
not
to
bring
forward
any
proof
you
see
what
deference
i
pay
him
his
mere
authority
would
make
me
yield
consent
often
in
reflecting
on
this
heavenly
genius
it
has
appeared
to
me
an
injustice
when
the
disciples
of
pythagoras
dispense
their
chief
from
submitting
proofs
that
plato
should
be
supposed
to
have
less
liberty
than
he
but
not
to
be
carried
away
from
our
subject
authority
reason
and
experience
alike
have
for
a
long
time
so
much
commended
this
axiom
of
plato
to
me
that
i
do
not
believe
anything
more
true
or
more
truly
holy
could
be
said
by
any
man
every
time
i
have
raised
myself
up
thanks
to
the
hand
of
god
stretched
out
to
me
i
have
recognised
with
infinite
joy
beyond
belief
who
it
was
that
then
preserved
me
and
who
had
cast
me
down
in
times
of
old
now
that
i
am
once
more
fallen
into
my
old
misery
i
feel
with
a
keen
sense
of
bitterness
that
failing
which
again
has
undone
me
and
this
i
tell
you
that
you
may
see
nothing
strange
in
my
saying
i
had
put
plato
maxim
to
the
proof
indeed
i
think
it
not
strange
for
i
have
been
witness
of
your
conflicts
i
have
seen
you
fall
and
then
once
again
rise
up
and
now
that
you
are
down
once
more
i
determined
from
pity
to
bring
you
my
succour
i
am
grateful
for
your
compassionate
feeling
but
of
what
avail
is
any
human
succour
it
avails
nothing
but
the
succour
of
god
is
much
every
way
none
can
be
chaste
except
god
give
him
the
grace
of
chastity
you
must
therefore
implore
this
grace
from
him
above
all
with
humbleness
and
often
it
may
be
with
tears
he
is
wont
never
to
deny
him
who
asks
as
he
should
so
often
have
i
done
it
that
i
fear
i
am
as
one
too
importunate
but
you
have
not
asked
with
due
humbleness
or
singleness
of
heart
you
have
ever
kept
a
corner
for
your
passions
to
creep
in
you
have
always
asked
that
your
prayers
may
be
granted
presently
i
speak
from
experience
for
i
did
likewise
in
my
old
life
i
said
give
me
chastity
but
not
now
put
it
off
a
little
while
the
time
will
soon
come
my
life
is
still
in
all
its
vigour
let
it
follow
its
own
course
obey
its
natural
laws
it
will
feel
it
more
of
a
shame
later
to
return
to
its
youthful
folly
i
will
give
up
this
failing
when
the
course
of
time
itself
shall
have
rendered
me
less
inclined
that
way
and
when
satiety
will
have
delivered
me
from
the
fear
of
going
back
in
talking
thus
do
you
not
perceive
that
you
prayed
for
one
thing
but
wished
another
in
your
heart
how
so
because
to
ask
for
a
thing
is
to
put
it
aside
for
with
tears
have
i
often
asked
for
it
my
hope
was
that
after
breaking
the
chain
of
my
passions
and
casting
away
the
misery
of
life
i
should
escape
safe
and
sound
and
after
so
many
storms
of
vain
anxieties
i
might
swim
ashore
in
some
haven
of
safety
but
you
see
alas
how
many
shipwrecks
i
have
suffered
among
the
same
rocks
and
shoals
and
how
i
shall
still
suffer
more
if
i
am
left
to
myself
trust
me
there
has
always
been
something
wanting
in
your
prayer
otherwise
the
supreme
giver
would
have
granted
it
or
as
in
the
case
of
the
apostle
would
have
only
denied
you
to
make
you
more
perfect
in
virtue
and
convince
you
entirely
of
your
own
frailty
that
is
my
conviction
also
and
i
will
go
on
praying
constantly
unwearied
unashamed
undespairing
the
almighty
taking
pity
on
my
sorrows
will
perchance
lend
an
ear
to
my
prayer
sent
up
daily
to
his
throne
and
even
as
he
would
not
have
denied
his
grace
if
my
prayers
had
been
pure
so
he
will
also
purify
them
you
are
quite
right
but
redouble
your
efforts
and
as
men
wounded
and
fallen
in
battle
raise
themselves
on
their
elbow
so
do
you
keep
a
look
out
on
all
sides
for
the
dangers
that
beset
you
for
fear
that
some
foe
unseen
come
near
and
do
you
hurt
yet
more
where
you
lie
on
the
ground
in
the
mean
time
pray
instantly
for
the
aid
of
him
who
is
able
to
raise
you
up
again
he
will
perchance
be
nearer
to
you
just
then
when
you
think
him
furthest
off
keep
ever
in
mind
that
saying
of
plato
we
were
speaking
of
just
now
nothing
so
much
hinders
the
knowledge
of
the
divine
as
lust
and
the
burning
desire
of
carnal
passion
ponder
well
therefore
this
doctrine
it
is
the
very
basis
of
our
purpose
that
we
have
in
hand
to
let
you
see
how
much
i
welcome
this
teaching
i
have
treasured
it
with
earnest
care
not
only
when
it
dwells
in
the
court
of
plato
royal
demesne
but
also
where
it
lurks
hidden
in
the
forests
of
other
writers
and
i
have
kept
note
in
my
memory
of
the
very
place
where
it
was
first
perceived
by
my
mind
i
wonder
what
is
your
meaning
do
you
mind
being
more
explicit
you
know
virgil
you
remember
through
what
dangers
he
makes
his
hero
pass
in
that
last
awful
night
of
the
sack
of
troy
yes
it
is
a
topic
repeated
over
and
over
again
in
all
the
schools
he
makes
him
recount
his
adventures
thus
what
tongue
could
tell
the
horrors
of
that
night
paint
all
the
forms
of
death
or
who
have
tears
enough
to
weep
so
many
wretched
wights
hath
the
great
city
that
so
long
was
queen
fallen
at
last
behold
in
all
the
streets
the
bodies
of
the
dead
by
thousands
strewn
and
in
their
homes
and
on
the
temple
steps
yet
is
there
other
blood
than
that
of
troy
what
time
her
vanquished
heroes
gathering
up
their
quenchless
courage
smite
anon
their
foes
they
though
triumphant
fall
everywhere
grief
dread
everywhere
and
in
all
places
death
now
wherever
he
wandered
accompanied
by
the
goddess
of
love
through
crowding
foes
through
burning
fire
he
could
not
discern
though
his
eyes
were
open
the
wrath
of
the
angered
gods
and
so
long
as
venus
was
speaking
to
him
he
only
had
understanding
for
things
of
earth
but
as
soon
as
she
left
him
you
remember
what
happened
he
immediately
beheld
the
frowning
faces
of
the
deities
and
recognised
what
dangers
beset
him
round
about
then
i
beheld
the
form
of
gods
in
anger
for
the
fall
of
troy
from
which
my
conclusion
is
that
commerce
with
venus
takes
away
the
vision
of
the
divine
among
the
clouds
themselves
you
have
clearly
discerned
the
light
of
truth
it
is
in
this
way
that
truth
abides
in
the
fictions
of
the
poets
and
one
perceives
it
shining
out
through
the
crevices
of
their
thought
but
as
we
shall
have
to
return
to
this
question
later
on
let
us
reserve
what
we
have
to
say
for
the
end
of
our
discourse
that
i
may
not
get
lost
in
tracks
unknown
to
me
may
i
ask
when
you
propose
to
return
to
this
point
i
have
not
yet
probed
the
deepest
wounds
of
your
soul
and
i
have
purposely
deferred
to
do
so
in
order
that
coming
at
the
end
my
counsels
may
be
more
deeply
graven
in
your
remembrance
in
another
dialogue
we
will
treat
more
fully
of
the
subject
of
the
desires
of
the
flesh
on
which
we
have
just
now
lightly
touched
go
on
then
now
as
you
proposed
yes
there
need
be
nothing
to
hinder
me
unless
you
are
obstinately
bent
on
stopping
me
indeed
nothing
will
please
me
better
than
to
banish
for
ever
every
cause
of
dispute
from
the
earth
i
have
never
engaged
in
disputation
even
on
things
perfectly
familiar
without
regretting
it
for
the
contentions
that
arise
even
between
friends
have
a
certain
character
of
sharpness
and
hostility
contrary
to
the
laws
of
friendship
but
pass
on
to
those
matters
in
which
you
think
i
shall
welcome
your
good
counsel
you
are
the
victim
of
a
terrible
plague
of
the
soul
melancholy
which
the
moderns
call
but
which
in
old
days
used
to
be
called
the
very
name
of
this
complaint
makes
me
shudder
nor
do
i
wonder
for
you
have
endured
its
burden
long
enough
yes
and
though
in
almost
all
other
diseases
which
torment
me
there
is
mingled
a
certain
false
delight
in
this
wretched
state
everything
is
harsh
gloomy
frightful
the
way
to
despair
is
for
ever
open
and
everything
goads
one
miserable
soul
to
moreover
while
other
passions
attack
me
only
in
bouts
which
though
frequent
are
but
short
and
for
a
moment
this
one
usually
has
invested
me
so
closely
that
it
clings
to
and
tortures
me
for
whole
days
and
nights
together
in
such
times
i
take
no
pleasure
in
the
light
of
day
i
see
nothing
i
am
as
one
plunged
in
the
darkness
of
hell
itself
and
seem
to
endure
death
in
its
most
cruel
form
but
what
one
may
call
the
climax
of
the
misery
is
that
i
so
feed
upon
my
tears
and
sufferings
with
a
morbid
attraction
that
i
can
only
be
rescued
from
it
by
main
force
and
in
despite
of
myself
so
well
do
you
know
your
symptoms
so
familiar
are
you
become
with
their
cause
that
i
beg
you
will
tell
me
what
is
it
that
depresses
you
most
at
the
present
hour
is
it
the
general
course
of
human
affairs
is
it
some
physical
trouble
or
some
disgrace
of
fortune
in
men
eyes
it
is
no
one
of
these
separately
had
i
only
been
challenged
to
single
combat
i
would
certainly
have
come
off
victorious
but
now
as
it
is
i
am
besieged
by
a
whole
host
of
enemies
i
pray
you
will
tell
me
fully
all
that
torments
you
every
time
that
fortune
pushes
me
back
one
step
i
stand
firm
and
courageous
recalling
to
myself
that
often
before
i
have
been
struck
in
the
same
way
and
yet
have
come
off
conqueror
if
after
that
she
presently
deals
me
a
sterner
blow
i
begin
to
stagger
somewhat
if
then
she
returns
to
the
charge
a
third
and
fourth
time
driven
by
force
i
retreat
not
hurriedly
but
step
by
step
to
the
citadel
of
reason
if
fortune
still
lays
siege
to
me
there
with
all
her
troops
and
if
to
reduce
me
to
surrender
she
piles
up
the
sorrows
of
our
human
lot
the
remembrance
of
my
old
miseries
and
the
dread
of
evils
yet
to
come
then
at
lost
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
seized
with
terror
at
these
calamities
i
bemoan
my
wretched
fate
and
feel
rising
in
my
very
soul
this
bitter
disdain
of
life
picture
to
yourself
some
one
beset
with
countless
enemies
with
no
hope
of
escape
or
of
pity
with
no
comfort
anywhere
with
every
one
and
everything
against
him
his
foes
bring
up
their
batteries
they
mine
the
very
ground
beneath
his
feet
the
towers
are
already
falling
the
ladders
are
at
the
gates
the
are
fastened
to
the
walls
the
fire
is
seen
crackling
through
the
roofs
and
at
sight
of
those
gleaming
swords
on
every
side
those
fierce
faces
of
his
foes
and
that
utter
ruin
that
is
upon
him
how
should
he
not
be
utterly
dismayed
and
overwhelmed
since
even
if
life
itself
should
be
left
yet
to
men
not
quite
bereft
of
every
feeling
the
loss
of
liberty
alone
is
a
mortal
stroke
although
your
confession
is
a
little
confused
i
make
out
that
your
misfortunes
all
proceed
from
a
single
false
conception
which
has
in
the
past
claimed
and
in
futuro
will
still
claim
innumerable
victims
you
have
a
bad
conceit
of
yourself
yes
truly
a
very
bad
one
and
why
not
for
one
but
a
thousand
reasons
you
are
like
people
who
on
the
slightest
offence
rake
up
all
the
old
grounds
of
quarrel
they
ever
had
in
my
case
there
is
no
wound
old
enough
for
it
to
have
been
effaced
and
forgotten
my
sufferings
are
all
quite
fresh
and
if
anything
by
chance
were
made
better
through
time
fortune
has
so
soon
redoubled
her
strokes
that
the
open
wound
has
never
been
perfectly
healed
over
i
can
not
moreover
rid
myself
of
that
hate
and
disdain
of
our
life
which
i
spoke
of
oppressed
with
that
i
can
not
but
be
grieved
and
sorrowful
exceedingly
that
you
call
this
grief
or
makes
no
difference
in
substance
we
mean
one
and
the
same
thing
as
from
what
i
can
understand
the
evil
is
so
it
will
do
no
good
to
heal
it
slightly
for
it
will
soon
throw
out
more
shoots
it
must
be
entirely
rooted
up
yet
i
know
not
where
to
begin
so
many
complications
alarm
me
but
to
make
the
task
of
dividing
the
matter
easier
i
will
examine
each
point
in
detail
tell
me
then
what
is
it
that
has
hurt
you
most
whatever
i
see
or
hear
or
feel
come
come
does
nothing
please
you
nothing
or
almost
nothing
would
to
god
that
at
least
the
better
things
in
your
life
might
be
dear
to
you
but
tell
me
what
is
it
that
is
to
you
the
most
displeasing
of
all
i
beg
you
give
me
an
answer
i
have
already
answered
it
is
this
melancholy
i
spoke
of
which
is
the
true
cause
of
all
your
displeasure
with
yourself
i
am
just
as
displeased
with
what
i
see
in
others
as
with
what
i
see
in
myself
that
too
comes
from
the
same
source
but
to
get
a
little
order
into
our
discourse
does
what
you
see
in
yourself
truly
displease
you
as
much
as
you
say
stop
worrying
me
with
your
petty
questions
that
are
more
than
i
know
how
to
reply
to
i
see
then
that
those
things
which
make
many
other
people
envy
you
are
nevertheless
in
your
own
eyes
of
no
account
at
all
any
one
who
envies
a
wretch
like
me
must
indeed
himself
be
wretched
but
now
please
tell
me
what
is
it
that
most
displeases
you
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
if
i
guess
right
will
you
acknowledge
it
yes
i
will
quite
freely
you
are
vexed
with
fortune
and
am
i
not
right
to
hate
her
proud
violent
blind
she
makes
a
mock
of
mankind
it
is
an
idle
complaint
let
us
look
now
at
your
own
troubles
if
i
prove
you
have
complained
unjustly
will
you
consent
to
retract
you
will
find
it
very
hard
to
convince
me
if
however
you
prove
me
in
the
wrong
i
will
give
in
you
find
that
fortune
is
to
you
too
unkind
not
too
unkind
too
unjust
too
proud
too
cruel
the
comic
poets
have
more
than
one
comedy
called
the
grumbler
there
are
scores
of
them
and
now
you
are
making
yourself
one
of
the
crowd
i
should
rather
find
you
in
more
select
company
but
as
this
subject
is
so
very
threadbare
that
no
one
can
add
anything
new
on
it
will
you
allow
me
to
offer
you
an
old
remedy
for
an
old
complaint
as
you
wish
well
then
has
poverty
yet
made
you
endure
hunger
and
thirst
and
cold
no
fortune
has
not
yet
brought
me
to
this
pass
yet
such
is
the
hard
lot
of
a
great
many
people
every
day
of
their
lives
is
it
not
use
some
other
remedy
than
this
if
you
can
for
this
brings
me
no
relief
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
in
their
own
misfortunes
rejoice
to
behold
the
crowd
of
other
wretched
ones
who
sob
around
them
and
not
seldom
i
mourn
as
much
for
the
griefs
of
others
as
for
my
own
i
wish
no
man
to
rejoice
in
witnessing
the
misfortunes
of
others
but
they
ought
at
any
rate
to
give
him
some
consolation
and
teach
him
not
to
complain
of
his
own
lot
all
the
world
can
not
possibly
occupy
the
first
and
best
place
how
could
there
be
any
first
unless
there
was
also
a
second
following
after
only
be
thankful
you
mortal
men
if
you
are
not
reduced
to
the
last
of
all
and
that
of
so
many
blows
of
outrageous
fortune
you
only
bear
her
milder
strokes
for
the
rest
to
those
who
are
doomed
to
endure
the
extremes
of
misery
one
must
offer
more
potent
remedies
than
you
have
need
of
whom
fortune
has
wounded
but
a
little
that
which
casts
men
down
into
these
doleful
moods
is
that
each
one
forgetting
his
own
condition
dreams
of
the
highest
place
and
like
every
one
else
as
i
just
now
pointed
out
can
not
possibly
attain
it
then
when
he
fails
he
is
discontented
if
they
only
knew
the
sorrows
that
attend
on
greatness
they
would
recoil
from
that
which
they
now
pursue
let
me
call
as
witnesses
those
who
by
dint
of
toil
have
reached
the
pinnacle
and
who
no
sooner
have
arrived
than
they
forthwith
bewail
the
too
easy
accomplishment
of
their
wish
this
truth
should
be
familiar
to
every
one
and
especially
to
you
to
whom
long
experience
has
shown
that
the
summit
of
rank
surrounded
as
it
is
with
trouble
and
anxieties
is
only
deserving
of
pity
it
follows
that
no
earthly
lot
of
man
is
free
from
complaint
since
those
who
have
attained
what
they
desire
and
those
who
have
missed
it
alike
show
some
reason
for
discontent
the
first
allege
they
have
been
cheated
and
the
second
that
they
have
suffered
neglect
take
seneca
advice
then
when
you
see
how
many
people
are
in
front
of
you
think
also
how
many
are
behind
if
you
would
be
reconciled
with
providence
and
your
own
lot
in
life
think
of
all
those
you
have
surpassed
and
as
the
same
wise
man
says
in
the
same
place
set
a
goal
to
your
desires
such
as
you
can
not
overleap
even
if
you
wish
i
have
long
ago
set
such
a
goal
to
my
desires
and
unless
i
am
mistaken
a
very
modest
one
but
in
the
pushing
and
shameless
manners
of
my
time
what
place
is
left
for
modesty
which
men
now
call
slackness
or
sloth
can
your
peace
of
mind
be
disturbed
by
the
opinion
of
the
crowd
whose
judgment
is
never
true
who
never
call
anything
by
its
right
name
but
unless
my
recollection
is
at
fault
you
used
to
look
down
on
their
opinion
never
believe
me
did
i
despise
it
more
than
i
do
now
i
care
as
much
for
what
the
crowd
thinks
of
me
as
i
care
what
i
am
thought
of
by
the
beasts
of
the
field
well
then
what
raises
my
spleen
is
that
having
of
all
my
contemporaries
whom
i
know
the
least
exalted
ambitions
not
one
of
them
has
encountered
so
many
difficulties
as
i
have
in
the
accomplishment
of
my
desires
most
assuredly
i
never
aspired
to
the
highest
place
i
call
the
spirit
of
truth
as
witness
who
judges
us
who
sees
all
and
who
has
always
read
my
most
secret
thoughts
she
knows
very
well
that
whenever
after
the
manner
of
men
i
have
gone
over
in
my
mind
all
the
degrees
and
conditions
of
our
human
lot
i
have
never
found
in
the
highest
place
that
tranquillity
and
serenity
of
soul
which
i
place
above
all
other
goods
and
for
that
matter
having
a
horror
of
a
life
full
of
disquiet
and
care
i
have
ever
chosen
in
my
modest
judgment
some
middle
position
and
given
not
but
the
homage
of
my
heart
to
that
truth
expressed
by
horace
whoso
with
little
wealth
will
live
content
easy
and
free
his
days
shall
all
be
spent
his
house
keeps
out
the
winter
wind
too
modest
to
excite
an
envious
mind
and
i
admire
the
reasons
he
gives
in
the
same
ode
not
less
than
the
sentiment
itself
the
tallest
trees
most
fear
the
tempest
might
the
highest
towers
come
down
with
most
affright
the
loftiest
hills
feel
first
the
thunder
smite
alas
it
is
just
the
middle
place
that
it
has
never
been
my
lot
to
enjoy
and
what
if
that
which
you
think
is
a
middle
position
is
in
truth
below
you
what
if
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
have
for
a
long
while
enjoyed
a
really
middle
place
enjoyed
it
abundantly
nay
what
if
you
have
in
truth
left
the
middle
far
behind
and
are
become
to
a
great
many
people
a
man
more
to
be
envied
than
despised
well
if
they
think
my
lot
one
to
be
envied
i
think
the
contrary
yes
your
false
opinion
is
precisely
the
cause
of
all
your
miseries
and
especially
of
this
last
as
cicero
puts
it
you
must
flee
charybdis
with
all
hands
to
the
oars
and
sails
as
well
whither
can
i
flee
where
direct
my
ship
in
a
word
what
am
i
to
think
except
what
i
see
before
my
eyes
you
only
see
from
side
to
side
where
your
view
is
limited
if
you
look
behind
you
will
discover
a
countless
throng
coming
after
and
that
you
are
somewhat
nearer
to
the
front
rank
than
to
that
in
the
rear
but
pride
and
stubbornness
suffer
you
not
to
turn
your
gaze
behind
you
nevertheless
from
time
to
time
i
have
done
so
and
have
noticed
many
people
coming
along
behind
i
have
no
cause
to
blush
at
my
condition
but
i
complain
of
having
so
many
cares
i
deplore
if
i
may
yet
again
make
use
of
a
phrase
of
horace
that
i
must
live
only
from
day
to
day
as
to
this
restlessness
of
which
i
have
suffered
more
than
enough
i
gladly
subscribe
to
what
the
same
poet
says
in
the
same
place
what
prayers
are
mine
o
may
i
yet
possess
the
goods
i
have
or
if
heaven
pleases
less
let
the
few
years
that
fate
may
grant
me
still
be
all
my
own
not
held
at
others
will
always
in
a
state
of
suspense
always
uncertain
of
the
future
fortune
favours
have
no
attraction
for
me
up
to
now
as
you
see
i
have
lived
always
in
dependence
on
others
it
is
the
bitterest
cup
of
all
may
heaven
grant
me
some
peace
in
what
is
left
of
my
old
age
and
that
the
mariner
who
has
lived
so
long
amid
the
stormy
waves
may
die
in
port
so
then
in
this
great
whirlpool
of
human
affairs
amid
so
many
vicissitudes
with
the
future
all
dark
before
you
in
a
word
placed
as
you
are
at
the
caprice
of
fortune
you
will
be
the
only
one
of
so
many
millions
of
mankind
who
shall
live
a
life
exempt
from
care
look
what
you
are
asking
for
o
mortal
man
look
what
you
demand
as
for
that
complaint
you
have
brought
forward
of
never
having
lived
a
life
of
your
own
what
it
really
amounts
to
is
not
that
you
have
lived
in
poverty
but
more
or
less
in
subservience
i
admit
as
you
say
that
it
is
a
thing
very
troublesome
however
if
you
look
around
you
will
find
very
few
men
who
have
lived
a
life
of
their
own
those
whom
one
counts
most
happy
and
for
whom
numbers
of
others
live
their
lives
bear
witness
by
the
constancy
of
their
vigils
and
their
toils
that
they
themselves
are
living
for
others
to
quote
you
a
striking
instance
julius
cæsar
of
whom
some
one
has
reported
this
true
but
arrogant
saying
the
human
race
only
lives
for
a
small
number
julius
cæsar
after
he
had
subdued
the
human
race
to
live
for
himself
alone
did
himself
live
for
other
people
perhaps
you
will
ask
me
for
whom
did
he
live
and
i
reply
for
those
who
slew
him
for
brutus
cimber
and
other
traitorous
heads
of
that
conspiracy
for
whom
his
inexhaustible
munificence
proved
too
small
to
satisfy
their
rapacity
i
must
admit
you
have
brought
me
to
my
senses
and
i
will
never
any
more
complain
either
of
my
obligations
to
others
or
of
my
poverty
complain
rather
of
your
want
of
wisdom
for
it
is
this
alone
that
can
obtain
for
you
liberty
and
true
riches
for
the
rest
the
man
who
quietly
endures
to
go
without
the
cause
of
those
good
effects
and
then
makes
complaint
of
not
having
them
can
not
truly
be
said
to
have
any
intelligent
understanding
of
either
the
cause
or
the
effects
but
now
tell
me
what
is
it
that
makes
you
suffer
apart
from
what
we
have
been
speaking
of
is
it
any
weakness
of
health
or
any
secret
trouble
i
confess
that
my
body
has
always
been
a
burden
every
time
i
think
of
myself
but
when
i
cast
my
eyes
on
the
unwieldiness
of
other
people
bodies
i
acknowledge
that
i
have
a
fairly
obedient
slave
i
would
to
heaven
i
could
say
as
much
of
my
soul
but
i
am
afraid
that
in
it
there
is
what
is
more
than
a
match
for
me
may
it
please
god
to
bring
that
also
under
the
rule
of
reason
but
to
come
back
to
your
body
of
what
do
you
complain
of
that
of
which
most
other
people
also
complain
i
charge
it
with
being
mortal
with
implicating
me
in
its
sufferings
loading
me
with
its
burdens
asking
me
to
sleep
when
my
soul
is
awake
and
subjecting
me
to
other
human
necessities
which
it
would
be
tedious
to
go
through
calm
yourself
i
entreat
you
and
remember
you
are
a
man
presently
your
agitation
will
cease
if
any
other
thing
troubles
you
tell
me
have
you
never
heard
how
cruelly
fortune
used
me
this
stepdame
who
in
a
single
day
with
her
ruthless
hand
laid
low
all
my
hopes
all
my
resources
my
family
and
home
i
see
your
tears
are
running
down
and
i
pass
on
the
present
is
not
the
time
for
instruction
but
only
for
giving
warning
let
then
this
simple
one
suffice
if
you
consider
in
truth
not
the
disasters
of
private
families
only
but
the
ruins
also
of
empires
from
the
beginning
of
history
with
which
you
are
so
well
acquainted
and
if
you
call
to
mind
the
tragedies
you
have
read
you
will
not
perhaps
be
so
sorely
offended
when
you
see
your
own
humble
roof
brought
to
nought
along
with
so
many
palaces
of
kings
now
pray
go
on
for
these
few
warning
words
will
open
to
you
a
field
for
long
meditation
who
shall
find
words
to
utter
my
daily
disgust
for
this
place
where
i
live
in
the
most
melancholy
and
disorderly
of
towns
the
narrow
and
obscure
sink
of
the
earth
where
all
the
filth
of
the
world
is
collected
what
brush
could
depict
the
nauseating
spectacle
streets
full
of
disease
and
infection
dirty
pigs
and
snarling
dogs
the
noise
of
grinding
against
the
walls
chariots
coming
dashing
down
at
every
the
motley
crew
of
people
swarms
of
vile
beggars
side
by
side
with
the
flaunting
luxury
of
the
wealthy
the
one
crushed
down
in
sordid
misery
the
others
debauched
with
pleasure
and
riot
and
then
the
medley
of
characters
such
diverse
rôles
in
life
the
endless
clamour
of
their
confused
voices
as
the
jostle
one
another
in
the
streets
all
this
destroys
the
soul
accustomed
to
any
better
kind
of
life
banishes
all
serenity
from
a
generous
heart
and
quite
upsets
the
student
habit
of
mind
so
my
prayers
to
god
are
earnest
as
well
as
frequent
that
he
would
save
my
barque
from
imminent
wreck
for
whenever
i
look
around
i
seem
to
myself
to
be
going
down
alive
into
the
pit
now
i
say
in
mockery
now
betake
yourself
to
noble
thoughts
now
go
and
meditate
the
tuneful
lyre
that
line
of
horace
makes
me
realise
what
most
afflicts
you
you
lament
having
lighted
on
a
place
so
unfavourable
for
study
for
as
the
same
poet
says
bards
fly
from
town
and
haunt
the
wood
and
glade
and
you
yourself
have
expressed
the
same
truth
in
other
words
the
leafy
forests
charm
the
sacred
muse
and
bards
the
noisy
life
of
towns
refuse
if
however
the
tumult
of
your
mind
within
should
once
learn
to
calm
itself
down
believe
me
this
din
and
bustle
around
you
though
it
will
strike
upon
your
senses
will
not
touch
your
soul
not
to
repeat
what
you
have
been
long
well
aware
of
you
have
seneca
letter
on
this
subject
and
it
is
very
much
to
the
point
you
have
your
own
work
also
on
tranquillity
of
soul
you
have
beside
for
combating
this
mental
malady
an
excellent
book
of
cicero
which
sums
up
the
discussions
of
the
third
day
in
his
and
is
dedicated
to
brutus
you
know
i
have
read
all
that
work
and
with
great
attention
and
have
you
got
no
help
from
it
well
yes
at
the
time
of
reading
much
help
but
no
sooner
is
the
book
from
my
hands
than
all
my
feeling
for
it
vanishes
this
way
of
reading
is
become
common
now
there
is
such
a
mob
of
lettered
men
a
detestable
herd
who
have
spread
themselves
everywhere
and
make
long
discussions
in
the
schools
on
the
art
of
life
which
they
put
in
practice
little
enough
but
if
you
would
only
make
notes
of
the
chief
points
in
what
you
read
you
would
then
gather
the
fruit
of
your
reading
what
kind
of
notes
whenever
you
read
a
book
and
meet
with
any
wholesome
maxims
by
which
you
feel
your
spirit
stirred
or
enthralled
do
not
trust
merely
to
the
resources
of
your
wits
but
make
a
point
of
learning
them
by
heart
and
making
them
quite
familiar
by
meditating
on
them
as
the
doctors
do
with
their
experiments
so
that
no
matter
when
or
where
some
urgent
case
of
illness
arises
you
have
the
remedy
written
so
to
speak
in
your
head
for
in
the
maladies
of
the
soul
as
in
those
of
the
body
there
are
some
in
which
delay
is
fatal
so
that
if
you
defer
the
remedy
you
take
away
all
hope
of
a
cure
who
is
not
aware
for
instance
that
certain
impulses
of
the
soul
are
so
swift
and
strong
that
unless
reason
checks
the
passion
from
which
they
arise
they
whelm
in
destruction
the
soul
and
body
and
the
whole
man
so
that
a
tardy
remedy
is
a
useless
one
anger
in
my
judgment
is
a
case
in
point
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
by
those
who
have
divided
the
soul
into
three
parts
anger
has
been
placed
below
the
seat
of
reason
and
reason
set
in
the
head
of
man
as
in
a
citadel
anger
in
the
heart
and
desire
lower
still
in
the
loins
they
wished
to
show
that
reason
was
ever
ready
to
repress
instantly
the
violent
outbreaks
of
the
passions
beneath
her
and
was
empowered
in
some
way
from
her
lofty
estate
to
sound
the
retreat
as
this
check
was
more
necessary
in
the
case
of
anger
it
has
been
placed
directly
under
reason
control
yes
and
rightly
and
to
show
you
i
have
found
this
truth
not
only
in
the
works
of
philosophers
but
also
in
the
poets
by
that
fury
of
winds
that
virgil
describes
hidden
in
deep
caves
by
his
mountains
piled
up
and
by
his
king
æolus
sitting
above
who
rules
them
with
his
power
i
have
often
thought
he
may
have
meant
to
denote
anger
and
the
other
passions
of
the
soul
which
seethe
at
the
bottom
of
our
heart
and
which
unless
controlled
by
the
curb
of
reason
would
in
their
furious
haste
as
he
says
drag
us
in
their
train
and
sweep
us
over
sea
and
land
and
the
very
sky
itself
in
effect
he
has
given
us
to
understand
he
means
by
the
earth
our
bodily
frame
by
the
sea
the
water
through
which
it
lives
and
by
the
depths
of
the
sky
the
soul
that
has
its
dwelling
in
a
place
remote
and
of
which
elsewhere
he
says
that
its
essence
is
formed
out
of
a
divine
fire
it
is
as
though
he
said
that
these
passions
will
hurl
body
soul
and
man
himself
into
the
abyss
on
the
other
side
these
mountains
and
this
king
sitting
on
high
what
can
they
mean
but
the
head
placed
on
high
where
reason
is
enthroned
these
are
virgil
words
there
in
a
cave
profound
king
æolus
holds
in
the
tempests
and
the
noisy
wind
which
there
he
prisons
fast
those
angry
thralls
rage
at
their
barrier
and
the
mountain
side
roars
with
their
dreadful
noise
but
he
on
top
sits
high
enthroned
his
sceptre
in
his
hand
so
writes
the
poet
as
i
carefully
study
every
word
i
have
heard
with
my
ears
the
fury
the
rage
the
roar
of
the
winds
i
have
heard
the
trembling
of
the
mountain
and
the
din
notice
how
well
it
all
applies
to
the
tempest
of
anger
and
on
the
other
hand
i
have
heard
the
king
sitting
on
his
high
place
his
sceptre
grasped
in
his
hand
subduing
binding
in
chains
and
imprisoning
those
rebel
blasts
who
can
doubt
that
with
equal
appropriateness
this
applies
to
the
reason
however
lest
any
one
should
miss
the
truth
that
all
this
refers
to
the
soul
and
the
wrath
that
vexes
it
you
see
he
adds
the
line
and
calms
their
passion
and
allays
their
wrath
i
can
not
but
applaud
that
meaning
which
i
understand
you
find
hidden
in
the
poet
story
familiar
as
it
is
to
you
for
whether
virgil
had
this
in
mind
when
writing
or
whether
without
any
such
idea
he
only
meant
to
depict
a
storm
at
sea
and
nothing
else
what
you
have
said
about
the
rush
of
anger
and
the
authority
of
reason
seems
to
me
expressed
with
equal
wit
and
truth
but
to
resume
the
thread
of
our
discourse
take
notice
in
your
reading
if
you
find
anything
dealing
with
anger
or
other
passions
of
the
soul
and
especially
with
this
plague
of
melancholy
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
at
some
length
when
you
come
to
any
passages
that
seem
to
you
useful
put
marks
against
them
which
may
serve
as
hooks
to
hold
them
fast
in
your
remembrance
lest
otherwise
they
might
be
taking
wings
to
flee
away
by
this
contrivance
you
will
be
able
to
stand
firm
against
all
the
passions
and
not
least
against
sorrow
of
heart
which
like
some
pestilential
cloud
utterly
destroys
the
seeds
of
virtue
and
all
the
fruits
of
understanding
and
is
in
the
elegant
phrase
of
cicero
the
fount
and
head
of
all
miseries
assuredly
if
you
look
carefully
at
the
lives
of
others
as
well
as
your
own
and
reflect
that
there
is
hardly
a
man
without
many
causes
of
grief
in
his
life
and
if
you
except
that
one
just
and
salutary
ground
the
recollection
of
your
own
sins
always
supposing
it
is
not
suffered
to
drive
you
to
despair
then
you
will
come
to
acknowledge
that
heaven
has
assigned
to
you
many
gifts
that
are
for
you
a
ground
of
consolation
and
joy
side
by
side
with
that
multitude
of
things
of
which
you
murmur
and
complain
as
for
your
complaint
that
you
have
not
had
any
life
of
your
own
and
the
vexation
you
feel
in
the
tumultuous
life
of
cities
you
will
find
no
small
consolation
in
reflecting
that
the
same
complaint
has
been
made
by
greater
men
than
yourself
and
that
if
you
have
of
your
own
free
will
fallen
into
this
labyrinth
so
you
can
of
your
own
free
will
make
your
escape
if
not
yet
in
time
your
ears
will
grow
so
used
to
the
noise
of
the
crowd
that
it
will
seem
to
you
as
pleasant
as
the
murmur
of
a
falling
stream
or
as
i
have
already
hinted
you
will
find
the
same
result
easily
if
you
will
but
first
calm
down
the
tumult
of
your
imagination
for
a
soul
serene
and
tranquil
in
itself
fears
not
the
coming
of
any
shadow
from
without
and
is
deaf
to
all
the
thunder
of
the
world
and
so
like
a
man
on
dry
land
and
out
of
danger
you
will
look
upon
the
shipwreck
of
others
and
from
your
quiet
haven
hear
the
cries
of
those
wrestling
with
the
waves
and
though
you
will
be
moved
with
tender
compassion
by
that
sight
yet
even
that
will
be
the
measure
also
of
your
own
thankfulness
and
joy
at
being
in
safety
and
ere
long
i
am
sure
you
will
banish
and
drive
away
all
the
melancholy
that
has
oppressed
your
soul
although
not
a
few
things
rather
give
me
a
twinge
and
especially
your
notion
that
it
is
quite
easy
and
depends
only
on
myself
to
get
away
from
towns
yet
as
you
have
on
many
points
got
the
better
of
me
in
reasoning
i
will
here
lay
down
my
arms
ere
i
am
quite
overthrown
do
you
feel
able
then
now
to
cast
off
your
sorrow
and
be
more
reconciled
to
your
fortune
yes
i
am
able
supposing
always
that
there
is
any
such
thing
as
fortune
at
all
for
i
notice
the
two
greek
and
latin
poets
are
so
little
of
one
mind
on
this
point
that
the
one
has
not
deigned
to
mention
the
word
even
once
in
all
his
works
whereas
the
other
mentions
the
name
of
fortune
often
and
even
reckons
her
almighty
and
this
opinion
is
shared
by
a
celebrated
historian
and
famous
orator
sallust
has
said
of
fortune
that
all
things
are
under
her
dominion
and
cicero
has
not
scrupled
to
affirm
that
she
is
the
mistress
of
human
affairs
for
myself
perhaps
i
will
declare
what
i
think
on
the
subject
at
some
other
time
and
place
but
so
far
as
concerns
the
matter
of
our
discussion
your
admonitions
have
been
of
such
service
to
me
that
when
i
compare
my
lot
with
that
of
most
other
men
it
no
longer
seems
so
unhappy
to
me
as
once
it
did
i
am
glad
indeed
to
have
been
of
any
service
to
you
and
my
desire
is
to
do
everything
i
can
but
as
our
converse
has
lasted
a
long
while
are
you
willing
that
we
should
defer
the
rest
for
a
third
day
when
we
will
bring
it
to
a
conclusion
with
my
whole
heart
i
adore
the
very
number
three
itself
not
so
much
because
the
three
graces
are
contained
in
it
as
because
it
is
held
to
be
nearest
of
kin
to
the
deity
which
is
not
only
the
persuasion
of
yourself
and
other
professors
of
the
true
faith
who
place
all
your
faith
in
the
trinity
but
also
that
of
gentile
philosophers
who
have
a
traditional
use
of
the
same
number
in
worshipping
their
own
deities
and
my
beloved
virgil
seems
to
have
been
conversant
with
this
when
he
wrote
uneven
number
to
the
gods
is
dear
for
what
goes
before
makes
it
clear
that
three
is
the
number
to
which
he
alludes
i
will
therefore
presently
await
from
your
hands
the
third
part
of
this
your
threefold
gift

supposing
that
hitherto
you
have
found
some
good
from
my
words
i
beg
and
implore
you
in
what
i
have
still
to
say
to
lend
me
a
ready
ear
and
to
put
aside
altogether
the
spirit
of
dispute
and
contradiction
you
may
be
sure
i
will
so
do
for
i
feel
that
owing
to
your
good
counsels
i
have
been
set
free
from
a
large
part
of
my
distress
and
am
therefore
the
better
disposed
to
listen
to
what
you
may
still
have
to
say
i
have
not
at
all
as
yet
touched
upon
the
wounds
which
are
within
and
i
rather
dread
the
task
when
i
remember
what
debate
and
murmuring
were
caused
by
even
the
lightest
allusion
to
them
but
on
the
other
hand
i
am
not
without
hope
that
when
you
have
rallied
your
strength
your
spirit
will
more
firmly
bear
without
flinching
a
severer
handling
of
the
trouble
have
no
fear
on
that
score
by
this
time
i
am
used
to
hearing
the
name
of
my
maladies
and
to
bearing
the
touch
of
the
surgeon
hand
well
you
are
still
held
in
bondage
on
your
right
hand
and
on
your
left
by
two
strong
chains
which
will
not
suffer
you
to
turn
your
thoughts
to
meditate
on
life
or
on
death
i
have
always
dreaded
these
might
bring
you
to
destruction
and
i
am
not
yet
at
all
reassured
and
i
shall
only
be
so
when
i
have
seen
you
break
and
cast
away
your
bonds
and
come
forth
perfectly
free
and
this
i
think
possible
but
difficult
enough
to
achieve
and
that
until
it
is
accomplished
i
shall
only
be
moving
in
a
futile
round
they
say
that
to
break
a
diamond
one
must
use
the
blood
of
a
goat
and
in
the
same
way
to
soften
the
hardness
of
these
kinds
of
passions
this
blood
is
of
strange
efficacy
no
sooner
has
it
touched
even
the
hardest
heart
but
it
breaks
and
penetrates
it
but
i
will
tell
you
what
my
fear
is
in
this
matter
i
must
have
your
own
full
assent
as
we
proceed
and
i
am
haunted
by
the
fear
you
will
not
be
able
or
perhaps
i
should
say
will
prove
unwilling
to
give
it
i
greatly
dread
lest
the
glittering
brilliance
of
your
chains
may
dazzle
your
eyes
and
hinder
you
and
make
you
like
the
miser
bound
in
prison
with
fetters
of
gold
who
wished
greatly
to
be
set
free
but
was
not
willing
to
break
his
chains
now
such
are
the
conditions
of
your
own
bondage
that
you
can
only
gain
your
freedom
by
breaking
your
chains
alas
alas
i
am
more
wretched
than
i
thought
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
my
soul
is
still
bound
by
two
chains
of
which
i
am
unconscious
all
the
same
they
are
plain
enough
to
see
but
dazzled
by
their
beauty
you
think
they
are
not
fetters
but
treasures
and
to
keep
to
the
same
figure
you
are
like
some
one
who
with
hands
and
feet
fast
bound
in
shackles
of
gold
should
look
at
them
with
delight
and
not
see
at
all
that
they
are
shackles
yes
you
yourself
with
blinded
eyes
keep
looking
at
your
bonds
but
oh
strange
delusion
you
are
charmed
with
the
very
chains
that
are
dragging
you
to
your
death
and
what
is
most
sad
of
all
you
glory
in
them
what
may
these
chains
be
of
which
you
speak
love
and
glory
great
heavens
what
is
this
i
hear
you
call
these
things
chains
and
you
would
break
them
from
me
if
i
would
let
you
yes
i
mean
to
try
but
i
doubt
if
i
shall
succeed
all
the
other
things
that
held
you
back
were
less
strong
and
also
less
pleasant
to
you
so
you
helped
me
to
break
them
these
on
the
contrary
are
pleasant
though
they
injure
and
they
deceive
you
by
a
false
show
of
beauty
so
they
will
demand
greater
efforts
for
you
will
make
resistance
as
if
i
were
wishing
to
rob
you
of
some
great
good
nevertheless
i
mean
to
try
pray
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
desire
to
relieve
me
of
the
finest
passions
of
my
nature
and
condemn
to
everlasting
darkness
the
clearest
faculties
of
my
soul
ah
unhappy
man
have
you
forgotten
quite
this
axiom
of
philosophy
that
the
climax
of
all
evils
is
when
a
man
rooted
in
some
false
opinion
by
degrees
grows
fatally
persuaded
that
such
and
such
a
course
is
right
i
have
by
no
means
forgotten
that
axiom
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
for
why
in
the
world
should
i
not
think
that
the
course
which
i
indicated
is
right
no
i
never
have
thought
and
i
never
shall
think
any
truth
more
indisputable
than
that
these
two
passions
which
you
cast
at
me
as
a
reproach
are
the
very
noblest
of
all
let
us
take
them
separately
for
the
present
while
i
endeavour
to
find
the
remedies
so
that
i
may
not
blunt
the
edge
of
my
weapon
by
striking
first
at
one
and
then
the
other
indiscriminately
tell
me
then
since
we
have
first
mentioned
love
do
you
or
do
you
not
hold
it
to
be
the
height
of
all
madness
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
as
i
conceive
it
i
judge
that
love
may
be
either
described
as
the
vilest
passion
or
the
noblest
action
of
the
soul
do
you
mind
giving
me
some
example
to
confirm
the
view
you
have
put
forward
if
my
passion
is
for
some
low
woman
of
ill
fame
my
love
is
the
height
of
folly
but
if
fascinated
by
one
who
is
the
image
of
virtue
i
devote
myself
to
love
and
honour
her
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
do
you
put
no
difference
between
things
so
entirely
opposed
do
you
wish
to
banish
all
remains
of
honour
from
the
case
to
tell
you
my
real
feeling
just
as
i
regard
the
first
kind
of
love
as
a
heavy
and
burden
on
the
soul
so
of
the
second
i
think
there
is
hardly
any
greater
blessing
to
it
if
it
so
happen
that
you
hold
an
opposite
view
let
each
one
follow
his
own
feeling
for
as
you
are
well
aware
truth
is
a
large
field
and
every
man
should
have
freedom
to
judge
for
himself
in
matters
directly
contradictory
opinions
also
may
be
diverse
but
truth
itself
is
one
and
always
the
same
i
admit
that
is
so
but
what
makes
us
go
wrong
is
that
we
bind
ourselves
obstinately
to
old
opinions
and
will
not
easily
part
from
them
heaven
grant
you
may
think
as
wisely
on
the
whole
matter
of
love
as
you
do
on
this
point
to
speak
briefly
i
think
i
am
so
certainly
right
that
those
who
think
the
opposite
i
believe
to
be
quite
out
of
their
senses
i
should
certainly
maintain
that
to
take
for
truth
some
ancient
falsehood
and
to
take
as
falsehood
some
truth
as
though
all
authority
for
truth
were
a
matter
of
time
is
the
very
climax
of
madness
you
are
wasting
your
labour
whoever
asserts
that
view
of
love
i
shall
never
believe
him
and
i
will
rest
on
cicero
saying
if
i
err
here
i
err
willingly
and
i
shall
never
consent
to
part
with
this
error
as
long
as
i
live
when
cicero
uses
those
words
he
is
speaking
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
referring
to
it
as
the
noblest
of
conceptions
and
declaring
his
own
belief
in
it
to
be
so
firm
that
he
would
not
endure
to
listen
to
any
one
who
maintained
the
contrary
you
however
to
urge
the
ignoblest
and
most
false
of
all
opinions
make
use
of
those
same
terms
unquestionably
even
if
the
soul
were
mortal
it
would
be
better
to
think
it
immortal
for
error
though
it
were
yet
would
it
inspire
the
love
of
virtue
and
that
is
a
thing
to
be
desired
for
its
own
sake
alone
even
if
all
hope
of
future
reward
were
taken
away
from
us
and
as
to
which
the
desire
for
it
will
certainly
become
weaker
as
men
come
to
think
the
soul
a
mortal
thing
and
on
the
other
hand
the
promise
of
a
life
to
come
even
if
it
were
to
turn
out
a
delusion
is
none
the
less
a
powerful
incentive
to
the
soul
human
nature
being
what
it
is
but
you
see
what
will
be
the
consequences
of
that
error
in
which
you
stand
it
will
precipitate
your
soul
into
all
manner
of
folly
when
shame
and
fear
even
reason
that
now
acts
as
some
check
on
passion
and
the
knowledge
of
truth
itself
shall
all
have
disappeared
i
have
already
told
you
you
were
wasting
your
time
my
own
remembrance
tells
mo
that
i
have
never
loved
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
and
on
the
contrary
have
ever
loved
what
is
most
noble
even
noble
things
may
be
loved
in
a
shameful
way
it
is
beyond
doubt
neither
in
the
object
of
love
nor
in
the
manner
of
loving
am
i
guilty
so
you
may
as
well
give
up
tormenting
me
well
well
do
you
wish
like
those
with
fever
on
the
brain
to
die
laughing
and
joking
or
will
you
rather
take
some
remedy
for
your
mind
so
pitiable
and
so
far
from
its
true
health
i
will
not
refuse
a
remedy
if
you
will
prove
to
me
that
i
am
ill
but
when
a
man
is
quite
well
to
begin
taking
remedies
is
often
fatal
as
soon
as
you
have
reached
the
stage
of
convalescence
you
will
perceive
quickly
enough
as
men
generally
do
that
you
have
been
seriously
after
all
i
can
not
but
show
deference
to
one
who
often
in
the
past
and
especially
in
these
last
two
days
has
given
me
proof
how
good
were
his
counsels
so
please
go
on
in
the
first
place
i
ask
you
to
forgive
me
if
compelled
by
the
subject
i
have
to
deal
severely
with
what
has
been
so
delightful
to
you
for
i
can
not
but
foresee
that
the
truth
will
sound
bitterly
in
your
ears
just
one
word
before
you
begin
do
you
thoroughly
know
the
matter
you
are
to
touch
upon
i
have
gone
into
it
all
carefully
beforehand
it
is
about
a
mortal
woman
in
admiring
and
celebrating
whom
you
have
alas
spent
a
large
part
of
your
life
that
a
mind
like
yours
should
have
felt
such
an
insensate
passion
and
for
so
long
a
time
does
greatly
astonish
me
spare
your
reproaches
i
pray
thais
and
livia
were
both
mortal
women
but
you
should
be
aware
that
she
of
whom
you
have
set
out
to
speak
is
a
mind
that
has
no
care
for
things
of
earth
and
burns
only
with
the
love
of
what
is
heavenly
in
whose
face
unless
truth
is
an
empty
word
a
certain
divine
loveliness
shines
out
whose
character
is
the
image
and
picture
of
perfect
honour
whose
voice
and
the
living
expression
of
whose
eyes
has
nothing
mortal
in
it
whose
very
form
and
motion
is
not
as
that
of
others
consider
this
again
and
again
i
entreat
you
and
i
trust
you
may
have
understanding
in
what
words
to
speak
ah
out
of
all
reason
have
you
grown
have
you
then
for
sixteen
long
years
been
feeding
with
false
joys
this
flame
of
your
heart
of
a
truth
not
longer
did
italy
once
suffer
the
assaults
of
her
most
famous
enemy
the
great
hannibal
nor
did
she
then
endure
more
frequent
onsets
of
her
lover
nor
was
consumed
with
more
furious
fires
you
carry
within
you
as
hot
a
flame
of
passion
you
endure
as
fierce
stings
yet
was
there
found
one
who
forced
him
to
retreat
and
though
late
to
take
his
leave
but
who
shall
expel
this
invader
from
your
soul
if
you
yourself
forbid
him
to
depart
if
you
of
your
own
will
invite
him
to
stay
long
with
you
if
you
unhappy
as
you
are
delight
in
your
own
calamity
far
other
will
be
your
thoughts
when
the
fatal
day
shall
come
that
will
close
for
ever
those
eyes
that
are
now
so
pleasing
to
you
to
look
upon
when
you
shall
see
that
face
and
those
pale
limbs
changed
by
death
then
you
will
be
filled
with
shame
to
have
so
knit
your
mortal
affections
to
a
perishing
body
such
as
this
and
what
now
you
so
obstinately
maintain
you
will
then
blush
to
remember
heaven
forbid
any
such
misery
i
shall
not
see
your
threats
fulfilled
they
will
inevitably
come
to
pass
i
know
it
but
the
stars
in
their
courses
will
not
so
fight
against
me
as
to
prevent
the
order
of
nature
by
hastening
her
death
like
that
first
came
i
into
this
world
and
i
shall
be
first
to
depart
i
think
you
will
not
have
forgotten
that
time
when
you
feared
the
contrary
event
and
made
a
song
of
your
beloved
as
if
she
were
presently
to
die
a
song
full
of
moving
sorrow
certainly
i
remember
very
well
but
the
thought
that
filled
me
then
with
grief
and
the
memory
of
which
makes
me
shiver
was
a
jealous
indignation
at
the
bare
possibility
of
my
outliving
her
who
is
the
best
part
of
my
life
and
whose
presence
makes
all
its
sweetness
for
that
is
the
motive
of
that
song
i
remember
it
well
and
how
i
was
overcome
with
tears
its
spirit
is
still
with
me
if
with
you
perchance
are
the
words
i
was
not
complaining
how
many
tears
the
fear
of
her
death
made
you
shed
nor
of
how
much
grief
you
felt
i
was
only
concerned
that
you
should
realise
how
this
fear
of
yours
in
the
past
may
certainly
return
and
more
easily
in
that
every
day
is
a
step
nearer
to
death
and
that
that
fair
form
worn
by
sicknesses
and
the
bearing
of
many
children
has
already
lost
much
of
its
first
strength
i
also
am
borne
down
with
cares
and
am
worn
with
age
and
in
that
onward
path
towards
death
i
have
outrun
her
whom
i
love
what
folly
it
is
to
calculate
the
order
of
death
by
that
of
birth
for
what
are
those
sad
lamentations
of
the
old
but
because
of
the
early
deaths
of
their
young
children
what
is
it
that
yonder
aged
nurse
is
grieving
over
but
that
she
sees
the
loss
of
her
little
nursling
whom
some
dark
day
has
stripped
of
his
sweet
life
and
cruel
fate
snatched
from
his
mother
breast
and
covered
him
in
a
too
early
grave
in
your
own
case
the
small
number
of
years
by
which
you
have
preceded
her
gives
you
a
very
uncertain
hope
that
you
will
be
gone
before
the
fire
of
your
passion
shall
be
extinguished
and
yet
you
indulge
the
fiction
that
this
order
of
nature
is
unchangeable
not
exactly
unchangeable
but
i
pray
without
ceasing
that
it
may
not
be
changed
and
whenever
i
think
of
death
i
remember
line
late
may
her
time
arrive
and
after
mine
i
can
listen
to
these
trifles
no
more
but
since
you
now
admit
that
she
may
possibly
die
before
you
i
ask
what
should
you
say
if
she
really
were
dead
what
should
i
say
but
that
such
a
calamity
would
be
the
climax
of
all
my
miseries
yet
i
should
try
and
comfort
myself
with
what
was
past
but
may
the
winds
bear
away
the
words
from
our
lips
and
the
hurricane
scatter
such
an
omen
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
ah
blindfold
one
you
see
not
yet
what
foolishness
it
is
so
to
subject
your
soul
to
things
of
earth
that
kindle
in
it
the
flames
of
desire
that
have
no
power
to
give
it
rest
that
can
not
endure
and
while
promising
to
charm
you
with
their
sweetness
torment
you
with
perpetual
agitations
if
you
have
any
more
effectual
remedy
i
beg
you
will
point
it
out
you
will
never
frighten
me
with
talk
like
this
for
i
am
not
as
you
suppose
infatuated
with
any
creature
that
is
mortal
you
might
have
known
that
i
have
loved
her
physical
charm
loss
than
her
soul
that
what
has
captivated
me
has
been
a
life
above
that
of
ordinary
lives
the
witnessing
of
which
has
shown
me
how
the
blessed
live
above
therefore
since
you
inquire
of
me
and
the
mere
question
is
a
torture
to
listen
to
what
i
should
do
supposing
she
were
to
leave
me
and
be
the
first
to
die
well
i
should
try
and
console
myself
in
sorrow
with
lælius
the
wisest
of
the
romans
with
him
i
should
say
it
is
her
goodness
that
i
loved
and
that
is
not
dead
and
i
would
say
to
myself
those
other
words
that
he
pronounced
after
the
death
of
him
for
whom
he
had
conceived
an
affection
surpassing
all
common
affection
you
retire
to
error
inaccessible
fastness
and
it
will
not
be
easy
to
dislodge
you
but
as
i
notice
you
are
inclined
to
listen
much
more
patiently
to
the
truth
about
yourself
and
her
sing
the
praises
of
your
darling
lady
as
much
as
you
will
and
i
will
gainsay
nothing
were
she
a
queen
a
saint
a
very
goddess
or
to
apollo
self
own
sister
or
a
mother
of
the
nymphs
yet
all
her
excellence
will
in
nowise
excuse
your
error
let
us
see
what
fresh
quarrel
you
seek
with
me
it
is
unquestionably
true
that
oftentimes
the
loveliest
things
are
loved
in
a
shameful
way
i
have
already
met
that
insinuation
on
a
previous
occasion
if
any
one
could
see
the
image
of
the
love
that
reigns
in
my
heart
he
would
recognise
that
there
is
no
difference
between
it
and
that
face
that
i
have
praised
indeed
much
but
less
by
far
than
it
deserves
to
be
praised
i
call
to
witness
the
spirit
of
truth
in
whose
presence
we
are
speaking
when
i
assert
that
in
my
love
there
has
never
been
anything
dishonourable
never
anything
of
the
flesh
never
anything
that
any
man
could
blame
unless
it
were
its
mere
intensity
and
if
you
add
that
even
so
it
never
passed
the
line
of
right
i
think
a
fairer
thing
could
never
be
conceived
i
might
reply
to
you
with
a
word
of
cicero
and
tell
you
you
are
talking
of
putting
boundary
lines
in
vice
itself
not
in
vice
but
in
love
but
in
that
very
passage
he
was
speaking
of
love
do
you
remember
where
it
occurs
do
i
remember
indeed
of
course
i
have
read
it
in
the
but
he
was
speaking
of
men
common
love
mine
is
one
by
itself
other
people
i
fancy
might
say
the
same
of
theirs
for
true
it
is
that
in
all
the
passions
and
most
of
all
in
this
every
man
interprets
his
own
case
favourably
and
there
is
point
in
the
verse
though
from
a
common
poet
to
every
man
his
lady
then
one
to
me
assign
to
every
man
his
love
affairs
and
so
let
me
have
mine
would
you
like
if
you
have
time
to
hear
me
tell
you
a
few
of
those
many
charms
of
hers
that
would
strike
you
with
astonishment
and
admiration
do
you
think
i
am
ignorant
of
all
those
pleasant
dreams
that
lovers
use
to
weave
every
schoolboy
knows
the
line
but
i
confess
i
am
ashamed
to
hear
such
silliness
from
the
lips
of
one
whose
words
and
thoughts
should
seek
a
higher
range
one
thing
i
will
not
keep
silence
on
call
it
silliness
call
it
gratitude
as
you
please
namely
that
to
her
i
owe
whatever
i
am
and
i
should
never
have
attained
such
little
renown
and
glory
as
i
have
unless
she
by
the
power
of
this
love
had
quickened
into
life
the
feeble
germ
of
virtue
that
nature
had
sown
in
my
heart
it
was
she
who
turned
my
youthful
soul
away
from
all
that
was
base
who
drew
me
as
it
were
by
a
grappling
chain
and
forced
me
to
look
upwards
why
should
you
not
believe
it
it
is
a
sure
truth
that
by
love
we
grow
like
what
we
love
now
there
is
no
backbiter
alive
let
his
tongue
be
as
sharp
as
it
may
that
has
ventured
to
touch
her
good
name
or
dared
to
say
he
had
seen
a
single
fault
i
will
not
say
in
her
conduct
but
even
in
any
one
of
her
gestures
or
words
moreover
those
whisperers
who
leave
no
one
reputation
untouched
if
they
can
help
it
have
been
obliged
in
her
case
to
utter
only
reverence
and
respect
it
is
no
wonder
then
if
such
a
glory
as
hers
should
have
fostered
in
my
heart
the
longing
for
more
conspicuous
glory
and
should
have
sweetened
those
hard
toils
which
i
had
to
endure
if
i
would
attain
that
which
i
desired
what
were
all
the
wishes
of
my
youth
but
solely
to
please
her
who
above
all
others
had
pleased
me
and
you
are
not
ignorant
that
to
gain
my
end
i
scorned
delights
a
thousand
times
i
gave
myself
before
my
time
to
labour
and
to
cares
without
number
and
now
you
bid
me
forget
or
diminish
somewhat
of
my
love
for
her
who
first
taught
me
how
to
escape
the
vulgar
crowd
who
guided
all
my
steps
spurred
on
my
lagging
mind
and
wakened
into
life
my
drowsy
spirit
poor
man
you
would
have
done
better
to
be
silent
than
to
speak
although
even
if
you
had
been
silent
i
should
have
discerned
what
you
are
within
but
such
stout
words
as
these
stir
my
indignation
and
anger
i
wonder
why
to
have
a
false
opinion
shows
ignorance
but
to
keep
on
boldly
proclaiming
it
shows
pride
as
well
as
ignorance
suppose
you
try
and
prove
that
what
i
think
and
say
is
false
it
is
all
false
and
first
what
you
say
as
to
owing
all
you
are
to
her
if
you
mean
that
she
has
made
you
what
you
are
there
you
certainly
lie
but
if
you
were
to
say
that
it
is
she
who
has
prevented
you
being
any
more
than
you
are
you
would
speak
the
truth
o
what
long
contention
would
you
have
been
spared
if
by
the
charm
of
her
beauty
she
had
not
held
you
back
what
you
are
you
owe
to
the
bounty
of
nature
what
you
might
have
been
she
has
quite
cut
off
or
rather
let
me
say
you
yourself
have
cut
it
off
for
she
indeed
is
innocent
that
beauty
which
seemed
so
charming
and
so
sweet
through
the
burning
flame
of
your
desire
through
the
continual
rain
of
your
tears
has
done
away
all
that
harvest
that
should
have
grown
from
the
seeds
of
virtue
in
your
soul
it
is
a
false
boast
of
yours
that
she
has
held
you
back
from
base
things
from
some
perhaps
she
may
but
only
to
plunge
you
into
evils
worse
still
for
if
one
leads
you
from
some
miry
path
to
bring
you
to
a
precipice
or
in
lancing
some
small
abscess
cuts
your
throat
he
deserves
not
the
name
of
deliverer
but
assassin
likewise
she
whom
you
hold
up
as
your
guide
though
she
drew
you
away
from
some
base
courses
has
none
the
less
overwhelmed
you
in
a
deep
gulf
of
splendid
ruin
as
for
her
having
taught
you
to
look
upwards
and
separate
yourself
from
the
vulgar
crowd
what
else
is
it
than
to
say
by
sitting
at
her
feet
you
became
so
infatuated
with
the
charm
of
her
above
as
to
studiously
neglect
everything
else
and
in
the
common
intercourse
of
human
life
what
can
be
more
injurious
than
that
when
you
say
she
has
involved
you
in
toils
without
number
there
indeed
you
speak
truth
but
what
great
gain
is
there
in
that
when
there
are
such
varied
labours
that
a
man
is
perforce
obliged
to
engage
in
what
madness
is
it
of
one
own
accord
to
go
after
fresh
ones
as
for
your
boasting
that
it
is
she
who
has
made
you
thirst
for
glory
i
pity
your
delusion
for
i
will
prove
to
you
that
of
all
the
burdens
of
your
soul
there
is
none
more
fatal
than
this
but
the
time
for
this
is
not
yet
come
i
believe
the
readiest
of
warriors
first
threatens
and
then
strikes
i
seem
however
to
find
threat
and
wound
together
and
already
i
begin
to
stagger
how
much
more
will
you
stagger
when
i
deliver
my
sharpest
thrust
of
all
forsooth
that
woman
to
whom
you
profess
you
owe
everything
she
even
she
has
been
your
ruin
good
heavens
how
do
you
think
you
will
persuade
me
of
that
she
has
detached
your
mind
from
the
love
of
heavenly
things
and
has
inclined
your
heart
to
love
the
creature
more
than
the
creator
and
that
one
path
alone
leads
sooner
than
any
other
to
death
i
pray
you
make
no
rash
judgment
the
love
which
i
feel
for
her
has
most
certainly
led
me
to
love
god
but
it
has
inverted
the
true
order
how
so
because
creature
should
be
dear
to
us
because
of
our
love
for
the
creator
but
in
your
case
on
the
contrary
held
captive
by
the
charm
of
the
creature
you
have
not
loved
the
creator
as
you
ought
you
have
admired
the
divine
artificer
as
though
in
all
his
works
he
had
made
nothing
fairer
than
the
object
of
your
love
although
in
truth
the
beauty
of
the
body
should
be
reckoned
last
of
all
i
call
truth
to
witness
as
she
stands
here
between
us
and
i
take
my
conscience
to
witness
also
as
i
said
before
that
the
body
of
my
lady
has
been
less
dear
to
me
than
her
soul
the
proof
of
it
is
here
that
the
further
she
has
advanced
in
age
which
for
the
beauty
of
the
body
is
a
fatal
thunderstroke
the
more
firm
has
been
my
admiration
for
albeit
the
flower
of
her
youth
has
withered
visibly
with
time
the
beauty
of
her
soul
has
grown
with
the
years
and
as
it
was
the
beginning
of
my
love
for
her
even
so
has
it
been
its
sustainer
otherwise
if
it
had
been
her
bodily
form
which
attracted
me
it
was
ere
this
time
to
make
a
change
are
you
mocking
me
do
you
mean
to
assert
that
if
the
same
soul
had
been
lodged
in
a
body
and
poor
to
look
upon
you
would
have
taken
equal
delight
therein
i
dare
not
say
that
for
the
soul
itself
can
not
be
discerned
and
the
image
of
a
body
like
that
would
have
given
no
indication
of
such
a
soul
but
were
it
possible
for
the
soul
to
be
visible
to
my
gaze
i
should
most
certainly
have
loved
its
beauty
even
though
its
were
poor
you
are
relying
on
mere
words
for
if
you
are
only
able
to
love
that
which
is
visible
to
your
gaze
then
what
you
love
is
the
bodily
form
however
i
deny
not
that
her
soul
and
her
character
have
helped
to
feed
your
flame
for
as
i
will
show
you
before
long
her
name
alone
has
both
little
and
much
kindled
your
mad
passion
for
as
in
all
the
affections
of
the
soul
it
happens
most
of
all
in
this
one
that
oftentimes
a
very
little
spark
will
light
a
great
fire
i
see
where
you
would
drive
me
you
want
to
make
me
say
with
ovid
i
love
at
once
her
body
and
her
soul
yes
and
you
ought
to
confess
this
also
that
neither
in
one
or
the
other
case
has
your
love
been
temperate
or
what
it
should
be
you
will
have
to
put
me
to
the
torture
ere
i
will
make
any
such
confession
and
you
will
allow
that
this
love
has
also
cast
you
into
great
miseries
though
you
place
me
on
the
block
itself
i
will
not
acknowledge
any
such
thing
if
you
do
not
ignore
my
questions
and
conclusions
you
will
soon
make
both
those
confessions
tell
me
then
can
you
recall
the
years
when
you
were
a
little
child
or
have
the
crowding
cares
of
your
present
life
blotted
all
that
time
out
my
childhood
and
youth
are
as
vividly
before
my
eyes
as
if
they
were
yesterday
do
you
remember
then
how
in
those
times
you
had
the
fear
of
god
how
you
thought
about
death
what
love
you
had
for
religion
how
dear
goodness
and
virtue
were
to
you
yes
i
remember
it
all
and
i
am
sorry
when
i
see
that
as
my
years
increased
these
virtues
grew
less
and
less
in
me
for
my
part
i
have
ever
been
afraid
lest
the
wind
of
spring
should
cut
that
early
blossom
off
which
if
only
it
might
be
left
whole
and
unhurt
would
have
produced
a
wondrous
fruitage
pray
do
not
wander
from
the
subject
for
what
has
this
to
do
with
the
question
we
were
discussing
i
will
tell
you
recall
each
step
in
your
life
since
your
remembrance
is
so
complete
and
fresh
recall
all
the
course
of
your
life
and
recollect
at
what
period
this
great
change
you
speak
of
began
i
have
run
over
in
my
mind
all
the
course
and
number
of
my
years
and
what
do
you
find
i
see
that
the
doctrine
in
the
treatise
of
pythagoras
of
which
i
have
heard
tell
and
have
read
is
by
no
means
void
of
truth
for
when
travelling
the
right
road
still
temperate
and
modest
i
had
reached
the
parting
of
the
ways
and
had
been
bidden
to
turn
to
the
right
hand
whether
from
carelessness
or
perversity
i
know
not
behold
i
turned
to
the
left
and
what
i
had
read
in
my
boyhood
was
of
no
profit
to
me
here
the
ways
part
the
right
will
thee
conduct
to
the
walled
palace
of
the
mighty
king
and
to
elysium
but
the
left
will
lead
where
sin
is
punished
and
the
malefactor
goes
to
his
dreaded
doom
although
i
had
read
of
all
this
before
yet
i
understood
it
not
until
i
found
it
by
experience
afterwards
i
went
wrong
in
this
foul
and
crooked
pathway
and
often
in
mind
went
back
with
tears
and
sorrow
yet
could
not
keep
the
right
way
and
it
was
when
i
left
that
way
yes
that
was
certainly
the
time
when
all
this
confusion
in
my
life
began
and
in
what
period
of
your
age
did
this
take
place
about
the
middle
of
my
growing
youth
but
if
you
give
me
a
minute
or
two
i
think
i
can
recall
the
exact
year
when
it
took
place
i
do
not
ask
for
the
precise
date
but
tell
me
about
when
was
it
that
you
saw
the
form
and
feature
of
this
woman
for
the
first
time
never
assuredly
shall
i
forget
that
day
well
now
put
two
and
two
together
compare
the
two
dates
i
must
confess
in
truth
they
coincide
i
first
saw
her
and
i
turned
from
my
right
course
at
one
and
the
same
time
that
is
all
i
wanted
you
became
infatuated
the
unwonted
dazzle
blinded
your
eyes
so
i
believe
for
they
say
the
first
effect
of
love
is
blindness
so
one
reads
in
the
poet
most
conversant
with
nature
at
the
first
sight
was
that
sidonian
dame
blinded
and
then
he
adds
presently
with
love
was
dido
burning
and
though
as
you
well
know
the
story
is
but
on
ancient
fable
yet
did
the
poet
in
making
it
follow
the
order
of
nature
and
when
you
had
been
struck
blind
by
this
meeting
if
you
chose
the
path
it
was
because
to
you
it
seemed
more
broad
and
easy
for
that
to
the
right
is
steep
and
narrow
and
of
its
hardship
you
were
afraid
but
that
woman
so
renowned
whom
you
imagine
as
your
most
safe
guide
wherefore
did
not
she
direct
you
upward
hesitating
and
trembling
as
you
were
why
did
she
not
take
you
by
the
hand
as
one
does
the
blind
and
set
you
in
the
way
where
you
should
walk
she
certainly
did
so
as
far
as
it
was
in
her
power
what
but
this
was
in
her
heart
when
unmoved
by
my
entreaties
unyielding
to
my
caress
she
safeguarded
her
woman
honour
and
in
spite
of
her
youth
and
mine
in
spite
of
a
thousand
circumstances
that
would
have
bent
a
heart
of
adamant
she
stood
her
ground
resolute
and
unsubdued
yes
this
womanly
soul
taught
me
what
should
be
the
honour
and
duty
of
a
man
and
to
preserve
her
chastity
she
did
as
seneca
expresses
it
what
was
to
me
at
once
an
example
and
a
reproach
and
at
last
when
she
saw
the
reins
of
my
chariot
were
broken
and
that
i
was
rushing
to
the
abyss
she
chose
rather
to
part
from
me
than
follow
where
i
went
base
desires
then
sometimes
you
felt
though
not
long
since
you
denied
it
but
it
is
the
common
folly
of
lovers
let
me
say
of
mad
folk
one
may
say
of
them
all
alike
i
would
not
yet
i
would
i
would
yet
would
not
you
know
not
any
of
you
what
you
want
or
what
you
want
not
without
seeing
i
fell
into
the
snare
but
if
in
past
days
my
feelings
were
other
than
they
are
now
love
and
youth
were
the
cause
now
i
know
what
i
wish
and
what
i
desire
and
i
have
at
last
made
firm
my
staggering
soul
she
for
her
part
has
ever
been
firm
in
her
mind
and
always
the
same
the
more
i
understand
this
constancy
the
more
i
admire
it
and
if
sometimes
i
regretted
her
resolution
now
i
rejoice
in
it
and
give
her
thanks
it
is
not
easy
to
believe
a
man
who
has
once
taken
you
in
you
may
have
changed
the
outside
fashion
of
your
life
but
have
not
yet
persuaded
me
that
your
soul
is
also
changed
if
your
flame
is
calmed
and
softened
somewhat
yet
it
is
not
for
certain
quite
put
out
but
you
who
set
such
price
on
her
you
love
do
you
not
see
how
deeply
by
absolving
her
you
condemn
yourself
you
delight
in
seeing
in
her
the
model
of
purity
and
you
avow
yourself
to
be
without
any
feeling
and
a
criminal
and
you
protest
that
she
is
the
most
happy
of
women
while
her
love
has
made
you
the
most
unhappy
of
men
if
you
remember
it
is
just
what
i
said
at
the
beginning
yes
i
remember
i
can
not
deny
that
what
you
say
is
true
and
i
see
whither
you
are
gradually
leading
me
to
see
it
better
still
lend
me
all
your
attention
nothing
so
much
leads
a
man
to
forget
or
despise
god
as
the
love
of
things
temporal
and
most
of
all
this
passion
that
we
call
love
and
to
which
by
the
greatest
of
all
desecrations
we
even
gave
the
name
of
god
without
doubt
only
that
we
may
throw
a
heavenly
veil
over
our
human
follies
and
make
a
pretext
of
divine
inspiration
when
we
want
to
commit
an
enormous
transgression
in
the
case
of
the
other
passions
the
sight
of
the
object
the
hope
of
enjoying
it
and
the
ardour
of
the
will
take
us
captive
love
also
demands
all
that
but
in
addition
it
asks
also
a
reciprocal
passion
without
which
it
will
be
forced
to
die
away
so
whereas
in
the
other
cases
one
loves
singly
and
alone
in
this
case
we
must
give
love
for
love
and
thus
man
heart
is
stung
and
stung
again
therefore
cicero
was
right
when
he
wrote
that
of
all
the
passions
of
the
soul
assuredly
the
most
violent
is
love
and
he
must
have
been
very
certain
of
his
ground
when
he
added
that
assuredly
he
who
in
four
books
shows
he
was
aware
how
academy
doubted
everything
i
have
often
noticed
that
reference
and
wondered
that
of
the
passions
he
should
call
this
the
most
violent
of
all
your
surprise
would
have
vanished
if
you
had
not
lost
your
powers
of
memory
but
i
must
recall
you
by
a
short
admonition
to
a
recollection
of
its
many
evils
think
what
you
were
when
that
plague
seized
upon
your
soul
how
suddenly
you
fell
to
bemoaning
and
came
to
such
a
pitch
of
wretchedness
that
you
felt
a
morbid
pleasure
in
feeding
on
tears
and
sighs
passing
sleepless
nights
and
murmuring
ever
the
name
of
your
beloved
scorning
everything
hating
life
desiring
death
with
a
melancholy
love
for
being
alone
avoiding
all
your
one
might
well
apply
to
you
for
they
exactly
fit
your
case
the
lines
in
which
homer
describes
bellerophon
there
in
the
pleasant
fields
he
wandered
sad
eating
his
heart
far
from
the
ways
of
men
what
meant
that
pale
face
and
wasted
figure
that
flower
of
your
age
withering
before
its
time
those
heavy
eyes
ever
bathed
in
tears
your
mind
in
a
state
of
agitation
your
broken
rest
and
troubled
moans
even
when
you
were
asleep
why
was
your
voice
weak
and
altered
through
your
sorrow
of
heart
and
the
very
sound
of
your
words
indistinct
and
broken
with
whatever
other
token
can
be
imagined
of
a
heart
distressed
and
in
disorder
do
you
call
these
the
signs
of
one
in
good
health
was
it
not
this
lady
with
whom
for
you
every
day
whether
feast
or
fast
began
and
ended
was
it
not
at
her
coming
the
sun
shone
forth
and
when
she
left
you
night
returned
every
change
of
her
countenance
brought
a
change
in
your
heart
and
if
she
were
sad
you
forthwith
were
filled
with
sadness
in
a
word
your
life
became
wholly
dependent
upon
hers
you
know
that
i
say
but
what
is
true
and
what
is
in
every
mouth
and
what
could
be
more
senseless
than
that
not
content
with
the
presence
of
her
living
face
the
cause
of
all
your
woes
you
must
needs
obtain
a
painted
picture
by
an
artist
of
high
repute
that
you
might
carry
it
everywhere
with
you
to
have
an
everlasting
spring
of
tears
fearing
i
suppose
lest
otherwise
their
fountain
might
dry
up
of
all
such
things
you
were
only
too
vigilant
and
you
neglected
everything
else
but
to
come
to
that
which
is
the
very
crowning
instance
of
your
folly
and
of
which
i
gave
you
warning
a
little
while
ago
who
could
sufficiently
utter
his
indignation
and
amazement
at
this
sign
of
a
distempered
mind
that
infatuated
as
much
by
the
beauty
of
her
name
as
of
her
person
you
have
with
perfectly
incredible
silliness
paid
honour
to
anything
that
has
the
remotest
connection
with
that
name
itself
had
you
any
liking
for
the
laurel
of
empire
or
of
poetry
it
was
forsooth
because
the
name
they
bore
was
hers
and
from
this
time
onwards
there
is
hardly
a
verse
from
your
pen
but
in
it
you
have
made
mention
of
the
laurel
as
if
indeed
you
were
a
denizen
of
stream
or
some
priest
on
cirrha
mount
and
finally
discovering
that
the
laurel
of
empire
was
beyond
your
reach
you
have
with
as
little
as
you
showed
in
the
case
of
your
beloved
herself
now
coveted
the
laurel
of
poetry
of
which
the
merit
of
your
works
seemed
to
give
more
promise
although
to
gain
your
reward
you
were
borne
up
on
the
wings
of
genius
yet
will
you
shudder
to
remember
with
what
trouble
you
attained
it
i
clearly
divine
what
excuse
you
will
make
and
i
see
your
thought
the
moment
you
open
your
lips
you
will
allege
that
you
were
devoted
to
these
studies
some
time
before
you
became
a
lover
at
all
and
that
desire
for
the
glory
of
the
poet
crown
had
kindled
your
heart
from
childhood
i
neither
deny
it
or
forget
it
but
the
fact
of
the
usage
being
obsolete
for
centuries
and
this
being
an
epoch
very
unfavourable
for
studies
like
yours
the
dangers
also
of
long
voyages
which
would
have
brought
you
to
the
threshold
of
prison
and
of
death
itself
not
to
mention
other
obstacles
of
fortune
no
less
violent
than
those
all
these
difficulties
i
say
would
perhaps
have
broken
your
resolve
entirely
if
the
remembrance
of
a
name
so
sweet
always
entwining
itself
with
your
inmost
soul
had
not
banished
every
other
care
and
drawn
you
over
sea
over
land
across
mountains
of
difficulty
to
rome
and
to
naples
where
at
length
you
attained
what
you
had
longed
for
with
such
ardour
if
all
this
seems
to
you
the
token
of
but
a
moderate
passion
then
at
least
shall
be
quite
certain
you
are
the
victim
of
the
moderate
delusion
i
purposely
leave
out
what
cicero
was
not
ashamed
to
imitate
from
terence
when
he
wrote
wrongs
suspicions
fierce
quarrels
jealousies
war
and
then
again
peace
behold
the
miseries
of
love
do
you
not
recognise
at
once
in
his
words
the
madness
and
above
all
the
madness
of
jealousy
which
as
one
knows
too
well
is
the
ruling
power
in
love
as
love
is
the
ruling
passion
among
all
others
perhaps
you
may
reply
i
admit
it
is
so
but
reason
will
be
there
to
temper
such
excess
terence
himself
had
anticipated
your
answer
when
he
added
such
fickle
things
to
settle
by
sane
rule
is
to
be
sanely
insane
the
phrase
the
truth
of
which
you
will
scarcely
question
puts
an
end
unless
i
am
mistaken
to
all
those
subterfuges
of
yours
such
then
are
the
miseries
of
love
the
particulars
of
which
it
is
needless
to
mention
to
those
who
have
proved
them
and
which
would
not
be
believed
by
those
who
never
tried
but
the
worst
of
them
all
to
come
back
to
our
subject
is
that
it
engenders
a
forgetfulness
of
god
and
of
man
real
state
for
how
should
the
soul
thus
crushed
beneath
these
weights
ever
arise
to
that
one
and
only
most
pure
fountain
of
true
good
and
since
it
is
so
you
may
lay
aside
your
wonder
that
cicero
should
tell
us
no
passion
of
man
soul
seemed
to
him
more
violent
than
love
i
must
own
myself
beaten
for
it
appears
all
you
have
said
is
taken
from
the
very
heart
of
the
book
of
experience
and
as
you
have
quoted
from
the
play
of
terence
let
me
please
myself
by
bringing
from
there
also
this
sad
complaint
o
deed
of
shame
now
am
i
foil
of
woe
weary
i
burn
with
love
with
open
eyes
brain
clear
i
am
undone
and
what
to
do
i
know
not
i
would
also
call
to
mind
this
counsel
from
the
same
poet
words
think
while
there
time
again
and
yet
again
and
i
likewise
from
the
lips
of
terence
will
give
you
my
reply
what
in
itself
contains
no
rule
or
reason
by
rule
or
reason
you
can
never
hold
what
is
to
be
done
then
am
i
to
despair
that
is
the
last
thing
in
the
world
to
do
however
let
me
briefly
tell
you
the
remedy
i
propose
you
know
that
on
this
subject
there
are
not
only
special
treatises
compiled
by
philosophers
of
eminence
but
that
some
of
the
most
famous
poets
have
written
on
it
whole
books
it
would
be
almost
an
insult
to
point
out
which
they
are
above
all
to
you
who
are
a
in
the
whole
field
or
to
offer
any
advice
as
to
reading
them
but
perhaps
i
might
say
a
word
without
offence
to
suggest
in
what
way
their
study
might
be
applied
for
your
own
welfare
first
then
notice
what
is
said
by
cicero
some
think
that
an
old
love
can
best
be
driven
out
by
a
new
as
one
nail
is
by
another
and
ovid
agrees
giving
this
general
rule
old
love
affairs
must
always
yield
to
new
and
without
a
doubt
it
is
the
truth
for
the
mind
thus
divided
and
parcelled
out
between
different
objects
feels
itself
moved
with
less
force
towards
each
one
so
the
river
ganges
they
tell
us
was
divided
up
by
the
persian
king
into
countless
channels
and
this
river
that
was
so
deep
and
formidable
was
cut
up
into
a
thousand
inconsiderable
streamlets
and
so
an
army
broken
up
and
scattered
becomes
vulnerable
by
the
enemy
so
fire
dispersed
dies
down
in
a
word
every
power
in
the
world
if
concentrated
increases
but
by
dispersion
is
reduced
on
the
other
hand
i
think
this
is
not
to
be
overlooked
that
there
may
be
great
danger
when
you
lay
aside
a
passion
and
if
one
may
say
so
a
passion
of
the
nobler
kind
you
may
if
you
are
not
watchful
fall
into
dissipation
of
another
sort
run
after
women
and
become
a
loose
libertine
in
my
judgment
then
if
one
must
die
for
certain
there
is
some
consolation
in
dying
of
a
nobler
rather
than
a
less
noble
wound
so
if
you
ask
my
advice
it
is
this
take
your
courage
in
both
hands
fly
if
you
possibly
can
and
i
would
even
say
go
from
one
prison
to
another
perchance
you
might
escape
by
the
way
or
else
find
a
milder
discipline
to
be
under
only
beware
when
your
neck
is
freed
from
one
such
yoke
as
this
that
you
place
it
not
under
the
weight
of
a
crowd
of
more
base
and
vile
oppressions
while
the
doctor
is
finishing
his
advice
will
he
allow
the
patient
in
the
throes
of
his
malady
to
interrupt
him
for
a
minute
of
course
why
not
many
a
doctor
guided
by
the
symptoms
of
his
patient
thus
declared
has
been
able
to
find
the
very
remedy
he
needed
then
what
i
want
to
say
is
just
this
for
me
to
love
another
is
impossible
my
mind
has
grown
only
to
love
her
my
eyes
to
look
only
for
her
excepting
her
all
to
them
is
nothing
or
is
mere
darkness
and
so
if
your
remedy
is
that
in
order
to
be
healed
of
this
love
i
should
love
another
your
condition
is
an
impossible
one
in
that
case
all
is
over
and
i
am
lost
your
senses
are
dulled
your
appetite
is
lost
since
then
you
can
take
no
internal
remedy
one
must
have
recourse
to
other
treatment
and
see
what
can
be
done
by
change
of
scene
can
you
bring
your
mind
to
think
of
flight
or
exile
and
going
right
away
from
the
places
that
you
know
though
i
feel
that
her
attraction
draws
me
to
her
with
hooks
of
steel
nevertheless
if
i
have
to
go
i
can
if
you
can
you
will
be
safe
what
else
can
i
say
then
but
this
advice
of
virgil
changing
only
two
little
words
ah
flee
this
land
beloved
and
leave
behind
shore
to
thee
so
dear
for
how
can
you
continue
in
safety
in
these
scenes
where
there
are
so
many
memories
of
your
wounds
where
things
present
and
the
memory
of
things
past
cling
always
to
you
so
that
i
say
as
cicero
also
advises
seek
change
of
scene
take
care
to
do
as
one
does
who
is
recovering
from
some
illness
think
of
what
you
are
prescribing
for
how
often
and
often
longing
to
get
well
and
familiar
with
advice
like
this
have
i
tried
this
remedy
of
flight
and
though
i
have
feigned
various
other
reasons
for
it
yet
the
end
and
aim
of
all
my
peregrinations
and
all
my
retirement
to
the
country
was
this
one
thing
to
become
free
for
that
i
have
wandered
far
away
to
the
west
to
the
north
to
the
very
confines
of
the
ocean
far
and
wide
have
i
roamed
you
see
what
good
it
has
done
me
and
so
virgil
simile
has
many
a
time
come
home
to
my
heart
as
the
stricken
deer
that
unaware
rooming
afar
in
pleasant
groves
of
crete
the
hunter
pierces
with
his
weapon
keen
and
she
unknowing
mount
dicte
side
flees
wounded
and
the
fatal
arrow
cleaves
to
her
poor
side
i
am
even
as
that
deer
i
have
fled
but
i
bear
everywhere
my
wound
with
me
yourself
have
given
me
the
answer
for
which
you
look
how
so
why
do
you
not
see
that
if
a
man
bears
his
wound
with
him
change
of
scone
is
but
an
aggravation
of
his
pain
and
not
a
means
of
healing
it
one
might
say
your
case
is
just
that
of
the
young
man
who
complained
to
socrates
that
he
had
been
a
tour
and
it
had
done
him
no
good
whatever
you
went
touring
with
yourself
said
the
sage
you
must
first
break
off
the
old
load
of
your
passions
you
must
make
your
soul
ready
you
must
fly
for
it
is
proved
to
demonstration
not
only
in
things
physical
but
in
moral
also
that
unless
the
patient
is
well
disposed
the
doctor
help
is
in
vain
otherwise
were
you
to
go
to
the
indies
you
will
find
that
horace
only
spoke
truth
when
he
said
who
cross
the
ocean
making
peace
their
goal
change
but
their
sky
and
can
not
change
their
soul
or
thus
we
come
to
this
when
the
world
we
range
is
but
our
climate
not
our
mind
we
change
i
must
say
i
can
not
follow
you
you
give
me
a
prescription
to
cure
and
heal
my
soul
and
tell
me
i
must
first
heal
it
and
then
flee
now
my
difficulty
is
i
do
not
know
how
to
heal
it
if
it
is
cured
what
more
do
i
need
but
if
again
it
is
not
cured
what
good
will
change
of
scene
bring
me
the
help
you
offer
me
is
useless
tell
me
briefly
what
are
the
remedies
i
must
use
i
did
not
say
that
you
must
cure
and
heal
your
soul
what
i
said
was
you
must
make
it
ready
as
for
the
rest
either
you
will
be
cured
and
the
change
of
scene
will
then
establish
your
health
on
a
firm
footing
or
you
will
not
yet
be
cured
but
only
made
ready
and
then
the
change
of
scene
will
have
the
same
ultimate
result
but
if
your
soul
is
neither
cured
nor
made
ready
this
change
and
frequent
moving
from
place
to
place
will
only
stir
up
its
grief
i
will
still
advise
you
to
take
a
leaf
out
of
horace
book
for
if
the
cure
of
mental
ills
is
due
to
sense
and
wisdom
not
a
fine
sea
view
what
he
says
is
true
you
will
set
out
full
of
the
hope
and
the
wish
to
return
carrying
along
with
you
all
that
has
ensnared
your
soul
in
whatever
place
you
are
to
whatever
side
you
turn
you
will
behold
the
face
you
will
hear
the
voice
of
her
whom
you
have
left
by
that
sad
enchantment
that
belongs
to
lovers
you
will
have
power
to
see
her
though
you
are
absent
and
to
hear
her
though
she
is
far
away
and
do
you
imagine
that
love
is
to
be
extinguished
by
subterfuges
like
this
believe
me
it
will
rather
burn
more
fiercely
those
who
call
themselves
masters
in
the
art
of
love
enjoin
among
their
other
maxims
short
absences
one
from
another
on
the
part
of
lovers
for
fear
they
should
become
tired
of
seeing
each
other
face
to
face
or
from
their
importunity
therefore
i
advise
i
recommend
i
enjoin
upon
you
that
you
learn
to
wholly
sever
your
soul
from
that
which
weighs
it
down
and
go
away
without
hope
of
return
you
will
discover
then
but
not
before
what
absence
is
able
to
do
for
the
soul
healing
if
fate
had
placed
your
lot
in
some
unhealthy
region
where
you
were
liable
to
constant
illness
should
you
not
flee
from
it
never
to
return
and
so
i
counsel
you
to
do
now
unless
as
i
much
fear
men
care
more
for
their
body
than
their
soul
that
is
their
affair
but
undoubtedly
if
i
found
myself
ill
on
account
of
the
unhealthiness
of
the
place
i
was
in
i
should
choose
for
my
recovery
some
place
with
a
healthier
climate
and
i
should
act
in
the
same
way
and
with
stronger
reasons
still
in
case
of
maladies
of
the
soul
yet
as
far
as
i
can
see
the
cure
of
these
is
a
more
difficult
matter
the
united
testimony
of
the
greatest
philosophers
proves
the
falsity
of
that
assertion
it
is
evident
that
all
the
maladies
of
the
soul
can
be
healed
if
only
the
patient
puts
no
obstacle
in
the
way
although
many
diseases
of
the
body
are
incurable
by
any
known
means
for
the
rest
and
not
to
go
too
far
from
our
subject
i
stick
to
my
judgment
you
must
as
i
said
make
your
soul
ready
and
teach
it
to
renounce
the
object
of
its
love
never
once
to
turn
back
never
to
see
that
which
it
was
wont
to
look
for
this
is
the
only
sure
road
for
a
lover
and
if
you
wish
to
preserve
your
soul
from
ruin
this
is
what
you
must
do
that
you
may
see
how
perfectly
i
have
learned
all
you
have
said
let
me
recapitulate
that
to
go
for
change
of
scene
is
useless
unless
the
soul
is
first
made
ready
such
journeys
will
cure
it
when
made
ready
and
will
establish
it
when
once
cured
is
not
that
the
conclusion
of
your
threefold
precept
yes
it
is
precisely
that
and
you
sum
up
very
well
what
i
have
unfolded
i
could
have
divined
your
two
first
truths
by
myself
without
you
pointing
them
out
but
as
for
the
third
that
the
soul
when
it
is
cured
and
established
in
health
still
needs
absence
i
do
not
understand
it
unless
it
is
the
fear
of
a
relapse
that
is
the
motive
of
what
you
say
but
you
surely
do
not
suppose
that
to
be
a
slight
point
even
in
bodily
health
and
how
much
more
grave
a
matter
ought
one
to
think
it
in
regard
to
the
soul
where
a
relapse
is
so
much
more
rapid
and
dangerous
so
i
would
say
let
us
refer
once
more
to
what
seems
one
of
the
soundest
remarks
of
seneca
where
in
a
letter
he
writes
if
any
man
wishes
to
have
done
with
love
he
must
avoid
all
recollection
of
the
beloved
form
and
adds
as
his
reason
for
nothing
is
so
easily
rekindled
to
life
again
as
love
o
how
true
a
saying
is
that
and
from
what
profound
experience
of
life
is
he
speaking
but
it
is
needless
to
call
any
other
witness
of
this
than
your
own
knowledge
will
supply
yes
i
agree
he
speaks
truth
but
if
you
notice
he
is
speaking
not
of
one
who
already
has
done
with
love
but
of
one
who
wishes
to
have
done
with
it
he
speaks
of
any
man
who
is
in
danger
any
kind
of
blow
is
more
dangerous
if
there
is
some
wound
before
unhealed
or
some
disease
not
yet
cured
and
even
afterwards
it
is
not
safe
and
since
we
remember
most
instances
that
have
come
home
to
us
in
our
own
experience
let
me
ask
how
often
have
you
who
speak
to
me
not
found
yourself
as
you
went
about
these
spots
by
their
mere
look
though
no
person
met
you
reminded
of
your
former
vanities
standing
speechless
full
of
sighs
as
you
pace
this
town
that
has
been
i
will
not
say
the
cause
but
at
any
rate
the
scene
of
all
your
evils
though
before
you
came
back
to
it
you
thought
you
were
cured
and
would
have
been
to
a
very
great
extent
if
only
you
had
remained
away
and
then
with
difficulty
restraining
your
tears
to
death
you
have
fled
and
cried
to
your
own
heart
here
in
these
places
i
see
at
every
turn
the
ambush
of
my
ancient
foe
the
signs
of
death
are
ever
about
me
so
then
were
you
healed
already
if
you
would
take
counsel
of
me
i
should
say
do
not
stay
long
in
this
place
it
is
not
wise
for
the
prisoner
who
has
broken
his
chains
to
go
wandering
round
the
prison
gates
ever
ready
to
take
him
in
again
before
which
the
jailer
is
ever
on
guard
laying
his
traps
with
special
care
to
recapture
those
whose
escape
he
regrets
the
downward
path
to
hell
is
ever
smooth
its
dismal
gate
is
open
night
and
day
if
precautions
like
these
are
needful
for
men
in
health
how
much
more
are
they
in
the
case
of
those
who
have
not
yet
shaken
off
their
sickness
it
is
of
the
latter
that
seneca
was
thinking
when
he
wrote
that
maxim
he
was
giving
counsel
to
those
who
were
most
in
danger
for
it
was
no
use
to
speak
of
those
whom
the
flame
had
already
devoured
and
who
were
past
all
care
for
their
safety
he
addressed
himself
to
those
in
another
stage
who
still
felt
the
heat
but
tried
to
come
forth
of
the
flame
many
a
sick
man
on
the
way
to
recovery
has
been
thrown
back
by
a
draught
of
water
which
before
his
illness
would
have
done
him
no
harm
and
often
has
one
wearied
out
with
a
long
day
work
been
knocked
down
by
some
trifling
shake
which
when
he
was
in
his
full
strength
would
not
have
moved
him
at
all
it
needs
but
a
trifle
sometimes
when
the
soul
is
emerging
from
its
miseries
to
plunge
it
quite
back
once
more
into
the
abyss
to
see
the
purple
on
the
shoulders
of
another
will
rouse
again
all
our
sleeping
ambition
the
sight
of
a
little
pile
of
money
sets
up
our
thirst
for
gold
one
look
at
some
fair
lady
will
stir
again
our
desire
the
light
glance
of
an
eye
will
awaken
sleeping
love
it
is
no
wonder
plagues
like
these
take
possession
of
your
minds
when
you
see
the
madness
of
the
world
and
when
once
they
have
found
their
way
back
to
the
soul
they
come
with
fatal
ease
and
since
it
is
so
it
is
not
enough
merely
to
leave
a
spot
but
you
o
man
must
keep
on
in
your
flight
for
life
till
you
have
escaped
everything
that
might
drag
the
soul
back
to
its
old
passions
for
fear
lest
when
you
return
from
the
pit
with
orpheus
and
look
back
you
lose
your
eurydice
once
more
such
is
the
sum
of
my
counsel
i
accept
it
heartily
and
with
thankfulness
for
i
feel
that
the
remedy
is
suited
to
my
wound
my
intention
is
to
fly
but
i
know
not
yet
where
lies
the
direction
i
should
choose
a
thousand
ways
are
open
to
you
to
make
choice
of
on
every
side
a
thousand
ports
are
ready
to
receive
you
i
know
that
more
than
to
other
lands
your
heart
turns
to
italy
and
that
a
love
of
your
native
soil
is
inborn
in
you
and
you
are
right
for
not
media
forests
rich
nor
ganges
stream
though
fair
it
be
nor
hermus
rolling
gold
may
vie
with
italy
bactria
and
ind
and
all
pachaia
with
its
odours
rare
shall
not
be
mentioned
i
think
you
have
yourself
not
long
ago
in
a
letter
to
one
of
your
friends
treated
this
theme
of
the
famous
poet
at
fuller
length
in
a
latin
poem
italy
then
would
be
my
choice
for
you
because
the
ways
of
its
people
its
climate
the
sea
washing
its
shores
the
apennine
range
coming
between
them
all
promise
that
a
sojourn
there
would
be
better
suited
to
extirpate
your
troubles
than
going
anywhere
else
in
the
world
i
would
not
however
wish
to
confine
you
only
to
one
corner
of
the
land
go
under
good
auspices
wherever
inclination
may
lead
go
without
fear
and
with
a
free
mind
take
no
backward
glances
forget
the
past
and
step
forward
to
the
future
see
how
long
you
have
been
a
stranger
to
your
own
country
and
your
own
self
it
is
time
to
return
for
o
now
is
evening
and
the
night
is
chiefly
friend
to
thieves
i
warn
you
in
words
of
your
own
one
further
counsel
i
must
urge
which
i
had
nearly
forgotten
you
must
avoid
solitude
until
you
are
quite
sure
that
you
have
not
a
trace
of
your
old
ailment
left
you
told
me
that
a
country
life
had
done
you
no
good
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
that
what
remedy
were
you
likely
to
find
in
a
place
all
lonely
and
remote
let
me
confess
that
often
when
you
were
retreating
thither
all
by
yourself
sighing
and
turning
longing
eyes
back
to
the
town
i
have
laughed
heartily
and
said
to
myself
what
a
blindfold
fool
love
has
made
of
this
unhappy
wight
and
led
him
to
quite
forget
the
verse
that
every
schoolboy
knows
about
flying
from
his
trouble
and
finding
his
death
i
am
afraid
you
are
right
but
what
are
the
lines
to
which
you
allude
ovid
of
course
lover
you
be
dwell
not
alone
in
solitude
you
sure
to
be
undone
you
safer
in
a
crowd
the
word
is
true
lone
woods
are
not
the
place
for
such
as
you
yes
i
remember
them
perfectly
and
knew
them
almost
by
heart
from
my
childhood
much
good
has
it
done
you
to
know
so
many
things
yet
not
know
how
to
suit
them
to
your
need
when
you
not
only
know
all
the
testimony
of
the
ancients
but
have
yourself
proved
the
evils
of
solitude
it
astonishes
me
that
you
should
commit
such
a
blunder
as
to
seek
it
you
have
in
fact
often
complained
that
there
was
no
good
in
being
alone
you
have
expressed
it
in
a
thousand
places
and
especially
in
the
fine
poem
you
composed
on
your
own
misfortune
the
sweet
accents
of
it
charmed
me
while
you
were
writing
it
surprised
me
to
hear
a
song
so
harmonious
arise
from
a
soul
so
full
of
agitation
and
come
from
the
lips
of
a
man
so
far
out
of
his
senses
and
i
asked
myself
what
power
of
love
can
stay
the
offended
muses
from
abandoning
so
dire
a
nest
of
troubles
and
scared
by
such
aberration
of
mind
in
their
host
forsaking
utterly
their
wonted
dwelling
i
thought
of
words
of
plato
let
no
man
wholly
sane
knock
at
poe
door
and
then
of
aristotle
who
followed
him
and
said
all
great
genius
has
a
touch
of
madness
in
it
but
i
remembered
that
in
these
sayings
of
theirs
they
were
thinking
of
a
frenzy
far
indeed
removed
from
yours
however
we
will
return
to
this
subject
at
some
other
time
i
must
fain
own
what
you
say
is
the
truth
but
i
never
thought
to
have
made
verses
so
harmonious
as
to
be
worth
your
praise
and
commendation
they
will
be
all
the
dearer
to
me
now
that
i
know
it
if
you
have
other
remedy
to
offer
me
i
beg
you
withhold
it
not
from
him
who
is
in
need
to
unfold
all
one
knows
is
the
act
of
a
braggart
more
than
of
a
wise
friend
and
remember
that
men
did
not
invent
all
the
sundry
kinds
of
remedies
internal
and
external
for
diverse
kinds
of
sickness
on
purpose
that
each
and
every
one
should
be
tried
on
every
occasion
but
that
as
seneca
remarks
to
lucilius
nothing
is
so
contrary
to
the
work
of
healing
as
a
frequent
change
of
remedy
and
no
wound
will
ever
be
healed
perfectly
to
which
first
one
and
then
another
medicine
is
continually
applied
the
true
way
is
only
to
try
the
new
when
the
old
remedy
has
failed
so
then
although
the
remedies
for
this
kind
of
ailment
are
many
and
varied
i
will
content
myself
with
only
pointing
out
a
few
and
i
will
choose
those
which
in
my
judgment
will
best
suit
your
need
for
indeed
i
have
no
wish
merely
to
show
you
what
is
new
but
only
to
tell
you
of
all
those
which
are
known
what
remedies
so
far
as
i
can
judge
are
most
likely
in
your
case
to
be
efficacious
there
are
three
things
as
cicero
says
that
will
avert
the
mind
of
man
from
love
satiety
shamefastness
reflection
there
may
indeed
be
more
there
may
be
less
but
to
follow
the
steps
of
so
great
an
authority
let
us
suppose
there
are
three
it
will
be
useless
for
me
to
speak
of
the
first
in
your
case
because
you
will
judge
it
is
impossible
you
should
ever
come
to
satiety
of
your
love
but
still
if
your
passion
will
hear
the
voice
of
reason
and
judge
the
future
from
the
past
you
will
readily
agree
that
an
object
even
the
most
beloved
can
produce
i
do
not
say
satiety
only
but
even
weariness
and
disgust
now
as
i
am
quite
sure
i
should
be
entering
on
a
vain
quest
if
i
embark
on
this
track
because
even
if
it
were
granted
that
satiety
is
a
possible
thing
and
that
it
kills
love
you
will
pretend
that
by
the
ardour
of
your
passion
you
are
a
thousand
leagues
removed
from
any
such
possibility
and
as
i
am
not
at
all
disposed
to
deny
it
what
remains
is
for
me
to
touch
only
upon
the
other
two
remedies
that
are
left
you
will
not
wish
to
dispute
my
assertion
that
nature
has
endowed
you
with
a
certain
power
of
reason
and
also
with
some
talent
for
forming
a
weighty
judgment
unless
i
am
deceived
by
acting
as
judge
in
my
own
cause
what
you
say
is
so
true
that
i
am
often
inclined
to
fear
i
am
too
wanting
in
what
is
due
both
to
my
sex
and
this
age
wherein
as
you
doubtless
observe
everything
goes
to
the
shameless
honours
prosperity
wealth
all
these
hold
the
field
and
to
these
virtue
itself
nay
even
fortune
must
give
way
do
you
not
see
what
conflict
there
is
between
love
and
shamefastness
while
the
one
urges
the
soul
forward
the
other
holds
it
back
the
one
drives
in
the
spur
the
other
pulls
hard
at
the
bridle
the
one
looks
at
nothing
the
other
watches
carefully
on
every
side
this
is
only
too
familiar
to
me
and
i
feel
to
my
cost
how
distracted
is
my
life
by
passions
so
contrary
they
come
upon
me
by
turn
so
that
my
poor
spirit
tossed
hither
and
thither
knows
not
which
impulse
to
obey
do
you
mind
telling
me
if
you
have
looked
in
your
glass
lately
and
pray
what
do
you
ask
that
question
for
i
have
only
done
as
usual
heaven
grant
you
do
it
no
oftener
neither
with
more
than
you
should
well
and
have
you
not
noticed
that
your
face
is
changing
from
day
to
day
and
that
from
time
to
time
grey
hairs
begin
to
show
themselves
around
your
temples
is
that
all
i
thought
you
were
about
to
ask
me
something
out
of
the
common
but
to
grow
up
to
grow
old
to
die
is
the
common
lot
of
all
that
are
born
i
have
observed
what
befalls
almost
all
my
contemporaries
for
nowadays
men
seem
to
age
more
quickly
than
they
used
to
though
i
know
not
why
or
wherefore
the
growing
old
of
others
will
not
give
you
back
your
youth
neither
will
their
dying
bring
you
immortality
so
let
us
leave
on
one
side
everything
else
and
return
to
your
own
case
tell
me
when
you
have
noticed
these
signs
of
change
in
your
body
has
it
not
brought
some
change
also
in
your
soul
it
has
certainly
made
some
impression
on
me
but
not
exactly
a
change
what
then
were
your
thoughts
and
what
did
you
say
to
yourself
what
would
you
have
me
say
except
what
was
said
by
domitian
the
emperor
with
even
mind
i
brook
the
sight
of
watching
though
still
young
my
hairs
grow
grey
so
illustrious
an
example
has
consoled
me
for
what
grey
hairs
i
too
behold
and
if
i
needed
more
i
brought
to
mind
a
king
beside
that
emperor
i
mean
numa
pompilius
the
second
who
as
the
historian
relates
had
grey
hair
even
from
his
youth
and
poetry
as
well
as
history
comes
to
my
aid
since
in
his
bucolics
our
own
virgil
writing
when
he
was
but
speaking
of
himself
in
the
person
of
a
shepherd
exclaims
when
now
my
whitening
beard
the
razor
knew
what
vast
abundance
of
examples
you
can
command
pray
heaven
you
have
as
many
recollections
of
your
own
death
for
i
praise
not
those
exemplars
that
lead
one
to
dissemble
grey
hairs
which
are
the
heralds
of
old
age
and
the
of
death
and
good
those
examples
are
not
if
their
effect
is
to
take
you
off
the
trouble
of
remembering
how
time
flies
and
to
lead
you
to
forget
your
own
last
hour
to
the
recollection
of
which
the
whole
of
my
discourse
is
entirely
and
without
ceasing
directed
when
i
bid
you
think
on
your
own
whitening
forehead
do
you
quote
me
a
crowd
of
famous
men
whose
locks
were
white
also
what
does
it
prove
ah
if
you
were
able
to
say
these
were
immortal
then
you
might
from
their
example
put
away
the
dread
of
your
changing
brow
if
instead
of
mentioning
greyness
i
had
ventured
to
hint
that
you
were
getting
bald
you
would
i
suppose
have
thrown
julius
cæsar
in
my
teeth
certainly
what
more
illustrious
example
could
i
need
now
unless
i
am
mistaken
it
is
in
fact
a
great
comfort
to
find
oneself
surrounded
by
companions
so
famous
yes
i
will
freely
admit
that
i
am
not
disposed
for
a
moment
to
reject
such
examples
which
are
for
me
part
of
the
luggage
i
carry
daily
in
my
mind
for
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
not
only
in
such
misfortunes
as
nature
or
chance
have
already
allotted
me
but
also
in
those
which
they
may
still
have
in
store
it
is
a
pleasure
i
say
to
have
ever
at
hand
such
matter
of
comfort
and
consolation
as
i
can
obtain
only
from
some
truly
cogent
reason
or
outstanding
example
if
then
you
meant
to
reproach
me
for
being
afraid
of
thunder
a
charge
i
could
not
deny
and
one
of
the
chief
reasons
why
i
love
the
laurel
is
because
it
is
said
that
thunder
will
not
strike
this
tree
then
i
shall
reply
to
you
that
this
was
a
weakness
cæsar
augustus
shared
if
you
allege
that
i
am
getting
blind
and
there
also
you
would
be
right
i
should
quote
you
appius
cæcus
and
also
homer
the
prince
of
poets
if
you
call
me
i
will
shield
myself
behind
hannibal
the
punic
leader
or
philip
king
of
macedon
call
me
deaf
and
marcus
crassus
shall
be
my
defence
say
i
can
not
stand
the
heat
and
i
will
say
i
am
but
like
alexander
prince
of
macedonia
it
were
tedious
to
go
through
all
the
list
but
after
these
you
can
judge
who
they
would
be
yes
perfectly
i
am
nowise
displeased
with
your
wealth
of
instances
provided
it
does
not
make
you
and
only
serves
to
disperse
the
clouds
of
fear
and
sadness
i
applaud
anything
that
helps
a
man
to
face
with
courage
the
coming
of
old
age
and
keeps
him
from
bewailing
its
presence
when
it
has
arrived
but
i
loathe
and
abominate
profoundly
everything
that
conceals
from
him
the
truth
that
old
age
is
the
port
of
departure
from
this
life
and
blinds
him
to
the
need
of
reflecting
on
death
to
take
with
equanimity
the
going
grey
before
one
time
is
the
sign
of
a
good
natural
disposition
but
to
try
and
interpose
artificial
checks
to
cheat
time
of
his
years
to
raise
an
outcry
and
declare
grey
hairs
are
come
too
soon
to
begin
dyeing
or
plucking
them
out
is
a
piece
of
folly
which
common
as
it
may
be
is
none
the
less
egregious
for
all
that
you
perceive
not
o
blind
that
you
are
how
swiftly
the
stars
roll
in
their
course
and
how
soon
the
flight
of
time
consumes
the
space
of
your
short
life
and
you
marvel
when
you
see
old
age
coming
on
hastening
quickly
the
despatch
of
all
your
days
two
causes
seem
to
foster
this
delusion
the
first
is
that
even
the
shortest
life
is
partitioned
out
by
some
people
into
four
by
others
into
six
and
by
others
again
into
a
still
larger
number
of
periods
that
is
to
say
the
reality
is
so
small
and
as
you
can
not
make
it
longer
you
think
you
will
enlarge
it
by
division
but
of
what
profit
tis
all
this
dividing
make
as
many
particles
as
you
like
and
they
are
all
gone
in
a
moment
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
yesterday
was
born
the
baby
see
the
lovely
boy
then
the
young
man
quick
as
may
be
then
an
end
of
life
and
joy
you
observe
with
what
quick
hurrying
words
the
subtle
poet
has
sketched
out
the
swift
course
of
our
life
so
it
is
in
vain
you
strive
to
lengthen
out
what
nature
the
mother
of
us
all
has
made
so
short
the
second
cause
is
that
you
will
persist
in
letting
old
age
find
you
still
in
the
midst
of
games
and
empty
pleasures
like
the
old
trojans
who
in
their
customary
ways
passed
the
last
night
without
perceiving
the
cunning
fatal
horse
who
bore
within
those
armed
bands
had
overleapt
the
wall
of
pergamos
yes
even
so
you
perceive
not
that
old
age
bringing
in
his
train
the
armed
warrior
death
unpitying
and
stem
has
the
rampart
of
your
body
and
then
you
find
your
foe
has
already
glided
by
stealth
along
his
rope
and
now
the
invader
climbs
within
the
gate
and
takes
the
city
in
its
drunken
sleep
for
in
the
gross
body
and
the
pleasure
of
things
temporal
not
less
drunk
are
you
than
those
old
trojans
were
as
virgil
saw
them
in
their
slumber
and
their
wine
or
looking
to
another
quarter
no
less
truth
is
to
be
found
in
the
neat
lines
of
the
satirist
our
lives
unfold
in
morning
air
as
lilies
of
a
day
bring
us
wine
we
shout
there
fetch
garlands
odours
damsels
fair
but
ah
before
we
are
aware
old
age
sweeps
all
away
now
to
come
back
to
our
subject
and
to
yourself
when
this
old
age
comes
stealing
on
and
knocks
at
your
door
you
make
an
effort
to
bar
him
out
you
pretend
that
by
some
infraction
of
the
order
of
nature
he
has
come
too
soon
you
are
delighted
when
you
come
across
some
rather
elderly
person
who
declares
he
knew
you
when
you
were
a
child
especially
if
as
people
generally
do
he
makes
out
it
was
but
yesterday
or
the
day
before
you
find
it
convenient
to
forget
that
one
can
say
as
much
about
any
old
dotard
however
decrepit
who
was
not
a
child
yesterday
or
as
far
as
that
goes
we
can
look
here
and
there
and
find
infants
of
ninety
quarrelling
about
trifles
and
even
now
occupied
with
infantine
toys
the
days
flee
away
the
body
decays
the
soul
is
where
it
was
though
everything
is
rotten
with
age
the
soul
has
never
grown
up
never
come
to
maturity
and
it
is
a
truth
as
the
proverb
says
one
soul
uses
up
many
bodies
infancy
passes
but
as
seneca
remarks
childishness
remains
and
believe
me
perhaps
you
are
not
so
young
as
you
imagine
for
the
greater
part
of
mankind
have
not
yet
reached
the
age
which
you
have
blush
therefore
to
pass
for
an
aged
lover
blush
to
be
so
long
the
public
jest
and
if
true
glory
has
no
charm
for
you
and
ridicule
no
terror
at
least
let
change
of
heart
come
to
the
rescue
and
save
you
from
disgrace
for
if
i
see
things
at
all
truly
a
man
should
guard
his
reputation
if
only
to
spare
his
own
friends
the
shameful
necessity
of
telling
lies
all
the
world
owes
this
to
itself
but
especially
such
a
man
as
yourself
who
have
so
great
a
public
to
justify
and
one
which
is
always
talking
of
you
great
is
the
task
to
guard
a
great
man
name
if
in
your
poem
of
you
make
a
truculent
enemy
tender
such
good
counsel
to
your
beloved
scipio
you
may
well
allow
for
your
own
profit
a
father
who
loves
you
tenderly
to
utter
with
his
lips
the
very
same
monition
put
away
the
childish
things
of
infancy
quench
the
burning
desires
of
youth
think
not
all
the
time
of
what
you
are
going
to
be
and
do
next
look
carefully
what
you
are
now
do
not
imagine
that
the
mirror
has
been
put
before
your
eyes
for
nothing
but
remember
that
which
is
written
in
the
book
of
questions
on
nature
mirrors
were
invented
that
men
might
know
themselves
much
profit
comes
thereby
first
knowledge
of
self
second
wise
counsel
you
are
handsome
then
beware
of
what
disfigures
plain
then
make
up
by
virtue
what
is
wanting
in
good
looks
you
are
young
then
remember
springtime
is
the
time
for
study
and
for
manly
work
old
then
lay
aside
the
ugly
vices
off
the
flesh
and
turn
your
thoughts
to
what
will
be
the
latter
end
it
has
dwelt
in
my
remembrance
always
from
the
first
day
that
ever
i
read
it
for
the
thing
itself
is
worth
remembering
and
its
warning
is
wise
of
what
profit
has
it
been
to
you
to
read
and
remember
you
had
better
excused
yourself
had
you
pleaded
ignorance
for
your
shield
knowing
what
you
do
are
you
not
ashamed
to
see
that
your
grey
hairs
have
brought
no
change
in
you
i
am
ashamed
i
regret
it
i
repent
of
it
but
as
for
doing
more
i
can
not
moreover
you
know
i
have
this
much
of
consolation
that
she
too
is
growing
old
with
me
the
very
word
of
julia
cæsar
augustus
daughter
doubtless
it
has
lain
fixed
in
your
mind
has
it
not
when
her
father
found
fault
because
she
would
not
have
older
people
round
her
as
did
livia
she
parried
the
paternal
reproof
by
the
neat
rejoinder
they
will
be
older
as
soon
as
i
am
but
pray
tell
me
do
you
suppose
that
at
your
age
it
will
be
more
becoming
to
doat
upon
an
old
woman
than
to
love
a
young
one
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
more
unbecoming
as
the
reason
for
loving
is
less
well
may
you
take
shame
to
yourself
never
to
grow
any
wiser
though
you
see
your
body
daily
growing
older
that
is
all
i
can
say
on
the
subject
of
shame
but
as
cicero
tells
us
it
is
but
a
poor
thing
to
make
shame
do
the
work
of
reason
and
so
to
reason
the
true
source
of
all
remedies
let
us
now
turn
for
help
you
will
assuredly
find
it
through
using
deep
reflection
the
third
of
the
things
that
turn
the
soul
away
from
love
remember
what
you
are
now
called
to
is
that
citadel
wherein
alone
you
can
be
quite
safe
against
the
incursions
of
passion
and
by
which
alone
you
will
deserve
the
name
of
man
consider
then
first
how
noble
a
thing
is
the
soul
and
that
so
great
is
it
that
were
i
to
discourse
as
i
should
wish
i
must
needs
make
a
whole
book
thereon
consider
again
the
frailty
and
vileness
of
the
body
which
would
demand
no
less
full
treatment
than
the
other
think
also
of
the
shortness
of
our
life
concerning
which
many
great
men
have
left
their
books
think
of
the
flight
of
time
that
no
one
yet
has
been
able
to
express
in
words
think
of
death
the
fact
so
certain
the
hour
so
uncertain
but
everywhere
and
at
all
times
imminent
think
how
men
are
deceived
just
in
this
one
point
that
they
believe
they
can
put
off
what
in
fact
never
can
be
put
off
for
no
one
is
really
such
a
fool
as
supposing
the
question
is
asked
him
not
to
answer
that
of
course
some
day
he
will
die
and
so
let
not
the
hope
of
longer
life
mock
you
as
it
mocks
so
many
others
but
rather
lay
up
in
your
heart
the
verse
that
seems
as
it
were
an
oracle
of
heaven
count
every
day
that
dawns
to
be
your
last
for
is
it
not
so
that
to
mortal
men
every
day
is
in
truth
the
last
or
all
but
the
last
consider
moreover
how
shameful
it
is
to
have
men
point
the
finger
at
you
and
to
become
a
public
remember
too
how
ill
your
profession
accords
with
a
life
like
this
think
how
this
woman
has
injured
your
soul
your
body
your
fortune
remember
what
you
have
borne
for
her
all
to
no
purpose
how
many
times
you
have
been
mocked
despised
scorned
think
what
flatteries
what
lamentations
and
of
all
the
tears
you
have
cast
upon
the
wind
think
how
again
and
again
she
has
heaped
all
this
on
you
with
an
air
of
haughty
disdain
and
how
if
for
a
moment
she
showed
herself
more
kind
it
was
but
for
the
passing
of
a
breath
and
then
was
gone
think
moreover
how
much
you
have
added
to
her
fame
and
of
what
she
has
subtracted
from
your
life
how
you
have
ever
been
jealous
for
her
good
name
but
she
has
been
always
regardless
of
your
very
self
and
condition
remember
how
she
has
turned
you
aside
from
loving
god
and
into
how
great
miseries
you
have
fallen
known
to
me
but
which
i
pass
in
silence
lest
the
birds
of
the
air
carry
the
matter
abroad
think
moreover
what
tasks
on
all
sides
are
claiming
your
attention
and
by
which
you
may
do
far
more
good
and
deserve
far
more
honour
how
many
things
you
have
on
hand
as
yet
uncompleted
to
which
it
would
be
far
better
for
you
to
return
and
devote
more
time
instead
of
attempting
them
so
perfunctorily
as
you
have
en
doing
lately
finally
ponder
well
what
that
thing
is
for
which
you
have
such
consuming
desire
but
think
like
a
man
and
with
your
wits
about
you
for
fear
lest
while
you
are
in
the
act
of
flying
you
be
cunningly
entangled
as
not
a
few
have
been
when
beauty
fascinating
charm
steals
upon
them
by
some
little
channel
and
then
is
fed
and
strengthened
by
evil
remedies
for
how
be
there
that
have
once
tasted
this
seductive
pleasure
and
can
retain
enough
manliness
not
to
say
courage
to
rate
at
its
true
value
that
poor
form
of
woman
of
which
i
speak
only
too
easily
strength
of
mind
gives
way
and
with
nature
pressing
on
he
falls
soonest
on
that
side
to
which
he
has
long
leaned
take
most
earnest
heed
that
this
happen
not
to
you
banish
every
recollection
of
those
old
cares
of
yours
put
far
away
from
you
every
vision
of
the
past
and
as
one
has
said
in
a
certain
place
dash
the
little
children
against
the
stones
lest
if
they
grow
up
you
yourself
be
cast
into
the
mire
and
defer
not
to
knock
at
heaven
door
with
prayers
let
your
supplications
weary
the
ears
of
the
heavenly
king
day
and
night
lift
up
your
petition
with
tears
and
crying
if
perchance
the
almighty
will
take
compassion
upon
you
and
give
an
end
to
your
sore
trouble
and
distress
these
are
the
things
that
you
must
do
these
the
safeguards
you
must
employ
if
you
will
observe
them
faithfully
the
divine
help
will
be
at
hand
as
i
trust
and
the
right
hand
of
the
deliverer
whom
none
can
resist
will
succour
you
but
albeit
i
have
spoken
on
this
one
malady
what
is
too
short
for
your
needs
but
too
long
for
the
briefness
of
our
time
let
us
pass
now
to
another
matter
one
evil
still
is
left
to
heal
you
of
which
i
now
will
make
a
last
endeavour
even
so
do
most
gentle
father
for
though
i
be
not
yet
wholly
set
free
from
my
burdens
yet
nevertheless
from
great
part
of
them
i
do
feel
in
truth
a
blessed
release
ambition
still
has
too
much
hold
on
you
you
seek
too
eagerly
the
praise
of
men
and
to
leave
behind
you
an
undying
name
i
freely
confess
it
i
can
not
beat
down
that
passion
in
my
soul
for
it
as
yet
i
have
found
no
cure
but
i
greatly
fear
lest
this
pursuit
of
a
false
immortality
of
fame
may
shut
for
you
the
way
that
leads
to
the
true
immortality
of
life
that
is
one
of
my
fears
also
but
i
await
your
discovering
to
me
the
means
to
save
my
life
you
of
a
truth
will
do
it
who
have
furnished
me
with
means
for
the
healing
of
evils
greater
still
think
not
that
any
of
your
ills
is
greater
than
this
one
though
i
deny
not
that
some
may
be
more
vile
but
tell
me
i
pray
you
what
in
your
opinion
is
this
thing
called
glory
that
you
so
ardently
covet
i
know
not
if
you
ask
me
for
a
definition
but
if
so
who
so
capable
to
give
one
as
yourself
the
name
of
glory
is
well
enough
known
to
you
but
to
the
real
thing
if
one
may
judge
by
your
actions
you
are
a
stranger
if
you
had
known
what
it
is
you
would
not
long
for
it
so
eagerly
suppose
you
define
glory
with
cicero
as
being
the
illustrious
and
renown
of
good
services
rendered
to
one
fellow
citizens
to
one
country
or
to
all
mankind
or
as
he
expresses
it
elsewhere
public
opinion
uttering
its
voice
about
a
man
in
words
of
praise
you
will
notice
that
in
both
these
cases
glory
is
said
to
be
reputation
now
do
you
know
what
this
reputation
is
i
can
not
say
any
good
description
of
it
occurs
to
me
at
the
moment
and
i
shrink
from
putting
forward
things
i
do
not
understand
i
think
therefore
the
truer
and
better
course
is
for
me
to
keep
silence
you
act
like
a
wise
and
modest
man
in
every
serious
question
and
especially
when
the
matter
is
ambiguous
one
should
pay
much
less
attention
to
what
one
will
say
than
to
what
one
will
not
say
for
the
credit
of
having
said
well
is
something
much
less
than
the
discredit
of
having
said
now
i
submit
to
you
that
reputation
is
nothing
but
talk
about
some
one
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
of
many
people
i
think
your
definition
or
if
you
prefer
the
word
your
description
is
a
good
one
it
is
then
but
a
breath
a
changing
wind
and
what
will
disgust
you
more
it
is
the
breath
of
a
crowd
i
know
to
whom
i
am
speaking
i
have
observed
that
no
man
more
than
you
abhors
the
manners
and
behaviour
of
the
common
herd
now
see
what
perversity
is
this
you
let
yourself
be
charmed
with
the
applause
of
those
whose
conduct
you
abominate
and
may
heaven
grant
you
are
only
charmed
and
that
you
put
not
in
their
power
your
own
everlasting
welfare
why
and
wherefore
i
ask
this
perpetual
toil
these
ceaseless
vigils
and
this
intense
application
to
study
you
will
answer
perhaps
that
you
seek
to
find
out
what
is
profitable
for
life
but
you
have
long
since
learned
what
is
needful
for
life
and
for
death
what
was
now
required
of
you
was
to
try
and
put
in
practice
what
you
know
instead
of
plunging
deeper
and
deeper
into
laborious
inquiries
where
new
problems
are
always
meeting
you
and
insoluble
mysteries
in
which
you
never
reach
the
end
add
to
which
the
fact
that
you
keep
toiling
and
toiling
to
satisfy
the
public
wearying
yourself
to
please
the
very
people
who
to
you
are
the
most
displeasing
gathering
now
a
flower
of
poesy
now
of
history
in
a
word
employing
all
your
genius
of
words
to
tickle
the
ears
of
the
listening
throng
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
can
not
let
that
pass
without
saying
a
word
never
since
i
was
a
boy
have
i
pleased
myself
with
elegant
extracts
and
flowerets
of
literature
for
often
have
i
noted
what
neat
and
excellent
things
cicero
has
uttered
against
butchers
of
books
and
especially
also
the
phrase
of
seneca
in
which
he
declares
it
is
a
disgrace
for
a
man
to
keep
hunting
for
flowers
and
prop
himself
up
on
familiar
quotations
and
only
stand
on
what
he
knows
by
heart
in
saying
what
i
did
i
neither
accuse
you
of
idleness
nor
scant
memory
what
i
blame
you
for
is
that
in
your
reading
you
have
picked
out
the
more
flowery
passages
for
the
amusement
of
your
cronies
and
as
it
were
packed
up
boxes
of
pretty
things
out
of
a
great
heap
for
the
benefit
of
your
friends
which
is
nothing
but
pandering
to
a
desire
of
vainglory
and
moreover
i
say
that
not
being
contented
with
your
duty
of
every
day
which
in
spite
of
great
expense
of
time
only
promised
you
some
celebrity
among
your
contemporaries
you
have
let
your
thoughts
run
on
ages
of
time
and
given
yourself
up
to
dreams
of
fame
among
those
who
come
after
and
in
pursuit
of
this
end
putting
your
hand
to
yet
greater
tasks
you
entered
on
writing
a
history
from
the
time
of
king
romulus
to
that
of
the
emperor
titus
an
enormous
undertaking
that
would
swallow
up
an
immensity
of
time
and
labour
then
without
waiting
till
this
was
finished
goaded
by
the
pricks
of
your
ambition
for
glory
you
sailed
off
in
your
poetical
barque
towards
africa
and
now
on
the
aforesaid
books
of
your
you
are
hard
at
work
without
relinquishing
the
other
and
in
this
way
you
devote
your
whole
life
to
those
two
absorbing
occupations
for
i
will
not
stop
to
mention
the
countless
others
that
come
in
also
and
throw
utterly
away
what
is
of
most
concern
and
which
when
lost
can
not
be
recovered
you
write
books
on
others
but
yourself
you
quite
forget
and
who
knows
but
what
before
either
of
your
works
be
finished
death
may
snatch
the
pen
from
your
tired
hand
and
while
in
your
insatiable
hunt
for
glory
you
hurry
on
first
by
one
path
then
the
other
you
may
find
at
last
that
by
neither
of
them
have
you
reached
your
goal
fears
of
that
kind
have
sometimes
come
over
me
i
confess
and
knowing
i
suffered
from
grave
illness
i
was
afraid
death
might
not
be
far
off
nothing
then
was
more
bitter
to
me
than
the
thought
of
leaving
my
half
finished
unwilling
that
another
hand
should
put
the
finishing
touch
i
had
determined
that
with
my
own
i
would
cast
it
to
the
flames
for
there
was
none
of
my
friends
whom
i
could
trust
to
do
me
this
service
after
i
was
gone
i
knew
that
a
request
like
that
was
the
only
one
of
our
virgil
which
the
emperor
cæsar
augustus
declined
to
grant
to
make
a
long
story
short
this
land
of
africa
burnt
already
by
that
fierce
sun
to
which
it
is
for
ever
exposed
already
three
times
by
the
roman
torches
devastated
far
and
wide
had
all
but
yet
again
by
my
hands
been
made
a
prey
to
the
flames
but
of
that
we
will
say
no
more
now
for
too
painful
are
the
recollections
that
it
brings
what
you
have
said
confirms
my
opinion
the
day
of
reckoning
is
put
off
for
a
short
time
but
the
account
remains
still
to
be
paid
and
what
can
be
more
foolish
than
thus
to
waste
such
enormous
labour
over
a
thing
of
uncertain
issue
i
know
what
prevents
you
abandoning
the
work
is
simply
that
you
still
hope
you
may
complete
it
as
i
see
that
there
will
be
some
difficulty
unless
i
am
mistaken
in
getting
you
to
diminish
this
hope
i
propose
we
try
to
magnify
it
and
so
set
it
out
in
words
that
you
will
see
how
disproportionate
it
is
to
toils
like
yours
suppose
therefore
that
you
have
full
abundance
of
time
leisure
and
freedom
of
mind
let
there
be
no
failure
of
intellect
no
languor
of
body
none
of
those
mischances
of
fortune
which
by
checking
the
first
onrush
of
expression
so
often
stop
the
ready
writer
pen
let
all
things
go
better
even
than
you
had
dared
to
wish
still
what
considerable
work
do
you
expect
to
achieve
oh
certainly
one
of
great
excellence
quite
out
of
the
common
and
likely
to
attract
attention
i
have
no
wish
to
seem
contradictory
let
us
suppose
it
may
be
a
work
of
great
excellence
but
if
you
knew
of
what
greater
excellence
still
is
the
work
which
this
will
hinder
you
would
abhor
what
you
now
desire
for
i
will
go
so
far
as
to
assert
that
this
work
of
yours
is
to
begin
with
taking
off
your
attention
from
cares
of
a
nobler
kind
and
greatly
excellent
as
you
think
it
has
no
wide
scope
nor
long
future
before
it
circumscribed
as
it
must
be
by
time
and
space
well
do
i
know
that
old
story
bandied
about
by
the
philosophers
how
they
declare
that
all
the
earth
is
but
a
tiny
point
how
the
soul
alone
endures
for
infinite
millions
of
years
how
fame
can
not
fill
either
the
earth
or
the
soul
and
other
paltry
pleas
of
this
sort
by
which
they
try
to
turn
minds
aside
from
the
love
of
glory
but
i
beg
you
will
produce
some
more
solid
arguments
than
these
if
you
know
any
for
experience
has
shown
me
that
all
this
is
more
specious
than
convincing
i
do
not
think
to
become
as
god
or
to
inhabit
eternity
or
embrace
heaven
and
earth
such
glory
as
belongs
to
man
is
enough
for
me
that
is
all
i
sigh
after
mortal
myself
it
is
but
mortal
blessings
i
desire
oh
if
that
is
what
you
truly
mean
how
wretched
are
you
if
you
have
no
desire
for
things
immortal
if
no
regard
for
what
is
eternal
then
you
are
indeed
wholly
of
the
earth
earthy
then
all
is
over
for
you
no
hope
at
all
is
left
heaven
defend
me
from
such
folly
but
my
conscience
is
witness
and
knows
what
have
been
my
desires
that
never
have
i
ceased
to
love
with
burning
zeal
the
things
eternal
i
said
or
if
perchance
i
am
mistaken
i
intended
to
say
that
my
wish
was
to
use
mortal
things
for
what
they
were
worth
to
do
no
violence
to
nature
by
bringing
to
its
good
things
a
limitless
and
immoderate
desire
and
so
to
follow
after
human
fame
as
knowing
that
both
myself
and
it
will
perish
there
you
speak
as
a
wise
man
but
when
you
declare
you
are
willing
to
rob
yourself
of
the
riches
that
will
endure
merely
for
the
sake
of
what
you
own
is
a
perishing
breath
of
applause
then
you
are
a
fool
indeed
true
i
may
be
postponing
those
riches
but
not
relinquishing
them
altogether
but
how
dangerous
is
such
delay
remembering
that
time
flies
fast
and
how
uncertain
our
short
life
is
let
me
ask
you
a
question
and
i
beg
you
to
answer
it
suppose
that
he
who
alone
can
fix
our
time
of
life
and
death
were
this
day
to
assign
you
one
whole
year
and
you
had
the
definite
certainty
of
how
would
you
propose
to
use
that
year
assuredly
i
should
use
great
economy
of
time
and
be
extremely
careful
to
employ
it
on
serious
things
and
i
suppose
no
man
alive
would
be
so
insolent
or
foolish
as
to
answer
your
question
in
any
other
way
you
have
answered
rightly
and
yet
the
folly
men
display
in
this
case
is
matter
of
astonishment
not
to
me
only
but
to
all
those
who
have
ever
written
on
this
subject
to
set
forth
what
they
feel
they
have
combined
every
faculty
they
possess
and
employed
all
their
eloquence
and
even
then
the
truth
itself
will
leave
their
utmost
efforts
far
behind
i
fear
i
do
not
understand
the
motive
of
so
great
astonishment
it
is
because
you
are
covetous
of
uncertain
riches
and
altogether
wasteful
of
those
which
are
eternal
doing
the
very
contrary
of
what
you
ought
to
do
if
you
were
not
quite
devoid
of
wisdom
so
this
space
of
a
year
though
short
enough
indeed
being
promised
you
by
him
who
deceives
not
neither
is
deceived
you
would
partition
out
and
dissipate
on
any
kind
of
folly
provided
you
could
keep
the
last
hour
for
the
care
of
your
salvation
the
horrible
and
hateful
madness
of
you
all
is
just
this
that
you
waste
your
time
on
ridiculous
vanities
as
if
there
were
enough
and
to
spare
and
though
you
do
not
in
the
least
know
if
what
you
have
will
be
long
enough
for
the
supreme
necessities
of
the
soul
in
face
of
death
the
man
who
has
one
year
of
life
possesses
something
certain
though
short
whereas
he
who
has
no
such
promise
and
lies
under
the
power
of
death
whose
stroke
may
fall
at
any
moment
which
is
the
common
lot
of
all
men
this
man
i
say
is
not
sure
of
a
year
a
day
no
not
even
of
one
hour
he
who
has
a
year
to
live
if
six
months
shall
have
slipped
away
will
still
have
another
left
to
run
but
for
you
if
you
lose
the
day
that
now
is
who
will
promise
you
it
is
cicero
who
says
it
is
certain
that
we
must
die
what
is
uncertain
is
whether
it
will
be
and
there
is
none
so
young
can
be
sure
he
will
live
until
the
evening
i
ask
then
of
you
and
i
ask
it
likewise
of
all
those
who
stand
gaping
after
the
future
and
pay
no
heed
to
the
present
who
knows
if
the
high
gods
will
add
even
one
morrow
to
this
your
little
day
of
life
if
i
am
to
answer
for
myself
and
for
all
no
one
knows
of
a
truth
but
let
us
hope
for
a
year
at
least
on
which
if
we
are
still
to
follow
cicero
even
the
most
aged
reckons
yes
and
as
he
also
adds
not
old
men
only
but
young
ones
too
are
fools
in
that
they
cherish
false
hope
and
promise
themselves
uncertain
goods
as
though
they
were
certain
but
let
us
take
for
granted
what
is
quite
impossible
that
the
duration
of
life
will
be
long
and
assured
still
do
you
not
find
it
is
the
height
of
madness
to
squander
the
best
years
and
the
best
parts
of
your
existence
on
pleading
only
the
eyes
of
others
and
tickling
other
men
ears
and
to
keep
the
last
and
worst
the
years
that
are
almost
good
for
nothing
that
bring
nothing
but
distaste
for
life
and
then
its
end
to
keep
these
i
say
for
god
and
yourself
as
though
the
welfare
of
your
soul
were
the
last
thing
you
cared
for
even
supposing
the
time
were
certain
is
it
not
reversing
the
true
order
to
put
off
the
best
to
the
last
i
do
not
think
my
way
of
looking
at
it
is
so
unreasonable
as
you
imagine
my
principle
in
that
as
concerning
the
glory
which
we
may
hope
for
here
below
it
is
right
for
us
to
seek
while
we
are
here
below
one
may
expect
to
enjoy
that
other
more
radiant
glory
in
heaven
when
we
shall
have
there
arrived
and
when
one
will
have
no
more
care
or
wish
for
the
glory
of
earth
therefore
as
i
think
it
is
in
the
true
order
that
mortal
men
should
first
care
for
mortal
things
and
that
to
things
transitory
things
eternal
should
succeed
because
to
pass
from
those
to
these
is
to
go
forward
in
most
certain
accordance
with
what
is
ordained
for
us
although
no
way
is
open
for
us
to
pass
back
again
from
eternity
to
time
o
man
little
in
yourself
and
of
little
wisdom
do
you
then
dream
that
you
shall
enjoy
every
pleasure
in
heaven
and
earth
and
everything
will
turn
out
fortunate
and
prosperous
for
you
always
and
everywhere
but
that
delusion
has
betrayed
thousands
of
men
thousands
of
times
and
has
sunk
into
hell
a
countless
host
of
souls
thinking
to
have
one
foot
on
earth
and
one
in
heaven
they
could
neither
stand
here
below
nor
mount
on
high
therefore
they
fell
miserably
and
the
moving
breeze
swept
them
suddenly
away
some
in
the
flower
of
their
age
and
some
when
they
were
in
midst
of
their
years
and
all
their
business
and
do
you
suppose
what
has
befallen
so
many
others
may
not
befall
you
alas
if
which
may
god
forefend
in
the
midst
of
all
your
plans
and
projects
you
should
be
cut
off
what
grief
what
shame
what
remorse
then
too
late
that
you
should
have
grasped
at
all
and
lost
all
may
the
most
high
in
his
mercy
save
me
from
that
misery
though
divine
mercy
may
deliver
a
man
from
his
folly
yet
it
will
not
excuse
it
presume
not
upon
this
mercy
overmuch
for
if
god
abhors
those
who
lose
hope
he
also
laughs
at
those
who
in
false
hope
put
their
trust
i
was
sorry
when
i
heard
fall
from
your
lips
that
phrase
about
despising
what
you
called
the
old
story
of
the
philosophers
on
this
matter
is
it
then
an
old
story
pray
by
figures
of
geometry
to
show
how
small
is
all
the
earth
and
to
prove
it
but
an
island
of
little
length
and
width
is
it
an
old
story
to
divide
the
earth
into
five
zones
the
largest
of
which
lying
in
the
centre
is
burned
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
the
two
utmost
to
right
and
left
are
a
prey
to
binding
frost
and
eternal
snow
which
leave
not
a
corner
where
man
can
dwell
but
those
other
two
between
the
middle
and
two
utmost
zones
are
inhabited
by
man
is
it
an
old
story
that
this
habitable
part
is
divided
again
into
two
parts
whereof
one
is
placed
under
your
feet
guarded
by
a
vast
sea
and
the
other
is
left
you
to
inhabit
everywhere
or
according
to
some
authorities
is
again
in
two
parts
subdivided
with
but
one
part
habitable
and
the
other
surrounded
by
the
winding
intricacies
of
the
northern
ocean
preventing
all
access
to
it
as
to
that
part
under
your
feet
called
the
antipodes
you
are
aware
that
for
a
long
time
the
most
learned
men
have
been
of
two
opinions
whether
it
is
inhabited
or
not
for
myself
i
have
set
forth
my
opinion
in
the
book
called
city
of
which
you
have
doubtless
read
is
it
also
an
old
story
that
your
habitable
part
already
so
restricted
is
yet
further
diminished
to
such
an
extent
by
seas
marshes
forests
sand
and
deserts
that
the
little
corner
left
you
of
which
you
are
so
proud
is
brought
down
to
almost
nothing
and
finally
is
it
an
old
story
to
point
out
to
you
that
on
this
narrow
strip
where
you
dwell
there
are
divers
kinds
of
life
different
religions
which
oppose
one
another
different
languages
and
customs
which
render
it
impossible
to
make
the
fame
of
your
name
go
far
but
if
these
things
are
to
you
nought
but
fables
so
to
me
all
i
had
promised
myself
of
your
future
greatness
must
be
a
fable
also
for
i
had
thought
hitherto
that
no
man
had
more
knowledge
of
these
things
than
you
yourself
to
say
nothing
of
the
conceptions
of
cicero
and
virgil
and
other
systems
of
knowledge
physical
or
poetic
of
which
you
seemed
to
have
a
competent
knowledge
i
knew
that
not
long
since
in
your
you
had
expressed
the
very
same
opinions
in
these
pretty
lines
the
universe
itself
is
but
an
isle
confined
in
narrow
bounds
small
and
begirt
by
ocean
flowing
waves
you
have
added
other
developments
later
on
and
now
that
i
know
you
think
them
all
fables
i
am
astonished
you
have
put
them
forth
with
such
hardihood
what
shall
i
say
now
of
the
brief
existence
of
human
fame
the
short
short
span
of
time
when
you
know
too
well
how
small
and
recent
even
the
oldest
memory
of
man
is
if
compared
to
eternity
i
spare
to
call
to
your
mind
those
opinions
of
the
men
of
old
laid
up
in
plato
and
in
the
sixth
book
of
cicero
where
it
is
foretold
what
floods
and
conflagrations
shall
be
coming
not
seldom
on
the
earth
to
many
men
such
things
have
seemed
probable
but
they
wear
a
different
aspect
to
those
who
like
yourself
have
come
to
know
the
true
religion
and
besides
these
how
many
other
things
there
are
that
militate
against
i
do
not
say
the
eternity
but
even
the
survival
of
name
first
there
is
the
death
of
those
with
whom
one
has
passed
one
life
and
that
forgetfulness
which
is
the
common
bane
of
old
age
then
there
is
the
rising
fame
ever
growing
greater
of
new
men
which
always
by
its
freshness
is
somewhat
derogatory
to
that
of
those
who
went
before
and
seems
to
mount
up
higher
just
in
so
far
as
it
can
depress
this
other
down
then
you
must
add
also
that
persistent
envy
which
ever
dogs
the
steps
of
those
who
embark
on
any
glorious
enterprise
and
the
hatred
of
truth
itself
and
the
fact
that
the
very
life
of
men
of
genius
is
odious
to
the
crowd
think
too
how
fickle
is
the
judgment
of
the
multitude
and
alas
for
the
sepulchres
of
the
dead
to
shatter
which
the
wild
fig
barren
branch
is
strong
enough
as
juvenal
has
told
us
in
your
own
you
call
this
elegantly
enough
a
second
death
and
if
i
may
here
address
to
you
the
same
words
you
have
put
in
the
mouth
of
another
the
animated
bust
and
storied
urn
shall
fall
and
with
them
fall
thy
memory
and
thou
my
son
thus
taste
a
second
death
lo
then
how
excellent
how
undying
that
glory
must
be
which
the
fall
of
one
poor
stone
can
bring
to
nought
and
then
consider
the
perishing
of
books
wherein
your
name
has
been
written
either
by
your
own
hand
or
another
even
though
that
perishing
may
appear
so
much
more
delayed
as
books
outlast
monuments
nevertheless
it
is
sooner
or
later
inevitable
for
as
is
the
case
with
everything
else
there
are
countless
natural
or
fortuitous
calamities
to
which
books
are
ever
exposed
and
even
if
they
escape
all
these
they
like
us
grow
old
and
die
for
whatsoever
mortal
hand
has
made
with
its
vain
labour
shall
be
mortal
too
if
one
may
be
allowed
for
choice
to
refute
your
childish
error
by
your
own
words
what
need
to
say
more
i
shall
never
cease
to
bring
to
your
recollection
lines
of
your
own
making
which
only
too
truly
fit
the
case
when
your
books
perish
you
shall
perish
too
this
is
the
third
death
still
to
be
endured
and
now
you
know
what
i
think
about
glory
perhaps
i
have
used
more
words
in
expressing
it
than
was
needful
for
you
or
me
and
yet
fewer
i
believe
than
the
importance
of
the
subject
demands
unless
perchance
you
still
think
all
these
things
only
an
old
story
no
indeed
what
you
have
been
saying
so
far
from
seeming
to
me
like
old
stories
has
stirred
in
me
a
new
desire
to
get
rid
of
my
old
delusions
for
albeit
that
these
things
were
known
to
me
long
ago
and
that
i
have
heard
them
oftentimes
repeated
since
as
terence
puts
it
everything
that
one
can
say
has
all
been
said
before
nevertheless
the
stateliness
of
phrase
the
orderly
narration
the
authority
of
him
who
speaks
can
not
but
move
me
deeply
but
i
have
yet
a
last
request
to
make
which
is
that
you
will
give
me
your
definite
judgment
on
this
point
is
it
your
wish
that
i
should
put
all
my
studies
on
one
side
and
renounce
every
ambition
or
would
you
advise
some
middle
course
i
will
never
advise
you
to
live
without
ambition
but
i
would
always
urge
you
to
put
virtue
before
glory
you
know
that
glory
is
in
a
sense
the
shadow
of
virtue
and
therefore
just
as
it
is
impossible
that
your
body
should
not
cast
a
shadow
if
the
sun
is
shining
so
it
is
impossible
also
in
the
light
of
god
himself
that
virtues
should
exist
and
not
make
their
glory
to
appear
whoever
then
would
take
true
glory
away
must
of
necessity
take
away
virtue
also
and
when
that
is
gone
man
life
is
left
bare
and
only
resembles
that
of
the
brute
beasts
that
follow
headlong
their
appetite
which
to
them
is
their
only
law
here
therefore
is
the
rule
for
you
to
live
by
follow
after
virtue
and
let
glory
take
care
of
itself
and
as
for
this
as
some
one
said
of
cato
the
less
you
seek
it
the
more
you
will
find
it
i
must
once
more
allow
myself
to
invoke
your
own
witness
thou
shalt
do
well
from
honour
self
to
flee
for
then
shell
honour
follow
after
thee
do
you
not
recognise
the
verse
it
is
your
own
one
would
surely
think
that
man
a
fool
who
at
midday
should
run
here
and
there
in
the
blaze
of
the
sun
wearing
himself
out
to
see
his
shadow
and
point
it
out
to
others
now
the
man
shows
no
more
sense
or
reason
who
amid
the
anxieties
of
life
takes
huge
trouble
first
one
way
then
another
to
spread
his
own
glory
abroad
what
then
let
a
man
march
steadily
to
the
goal
set
before
him
his
shadow
will
follow
him
step
by
step
let
him
so
act
that
he
shall
make
virtue
his
prize
and
lo
glory
also
shall
be
found
at
his
side
i
speak
of
that
glory
which
is
virtue
true
companion
as
for
that
which
comes
by
other
means
whether
from
bodily
grace
or
mere
cleverness
in
the
countless
ways
men
have
invented
it
does
not
seem
to
me
worthy
of
the
name
and
so
in
regard
to
yourself
while
you
are
wearing
your
strength
out
by
such
great
labours
in
writing
books
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
you
are
shooting
wide
of
the
mark
for
you
are
spending
all
your
efforts
on
things
that
concern
others
and
neglecting
those
that
are
your
own
and
so
through
this
vain
hope
of
glory
the
time
so
precious
though
you
know
it
not
is
passing
away
what
must
i
do
then
abandon
my
unfinished
works
or
would
it
be
better
to
hasten
them
on
and
if
god
gives
me
grace
put
the
finishing
touch
to
them
if
i
were
once
rid
of
these
cares
i
would
go
forward
with
a
mind
more
free
to
greater
things
for
hardly
could
i
bear
the
thought
of
leaving
half
completed
a
work
so
fine
and
rich
in
promise
of
success
which
foot
you
mean
to
hobble
on
i
do
not
know
you
seem
inclined
to
leave
yourself
derelict
rather
than
your
books
as
for
me
i
shall
do
my
duty
with
what
success
depends
on
you
but
at
least
i
shall
have
satisfied
my
conscience
throw
to
the
winds
those
great
loads
of
histories
the
deeds
of
the
romans
have
been
celebrated
quite
enough
by
others
and
are
known
by
their
own
fame
get
out
of
africa
and
leave
it
to
its
possessors
you
will
add
nothing
to
the
glory
of
your
scipio
or
to
your
own
he
can
be
exalted
to
no
higher
pinnacle
but
you
may
bring
down
his
reputation
and
with
it
your
own
therefore
leave
all
this
on
one
side
and
now
at
length
take
possession
of
yourself
and
to
come
back
to
our
let
me
urge
you
to
enter
upon
the
meditation
of
your
last
end
which
comes
on
step
by
step
without
your
being
aware
tear
off
the
veil
disperse
the
shadows
look
only
on
that
which
is
coming
with
eyes
and
mind
give
all
your
attention
there
let
nought
else
distract
you
heaven
earth
the
sea
these
all
suffer
change
what
can
man
the
frailest
of
all
creatures
hope
for
the
seasons
fulfil
their
courses
and
change
nothing
remains
as
it
was
if
you
think
you
shall
remain
you
are
deceived
for
horace
beautifully
says
the
losses
of
the
changing
heaven
the
changing
moons
repair
but
we
when
we
have
gone
below
and
our
rich
land
no
longer
know
and
hear
no
more
its
rivers
flow
are
nought
but
dust
and
air
therefore
as
often
as
you
watch
the
fruits
of
summer
follow
the
flowers
of
spring
and
the
pleasant
cool
of
autumn
succeed
the
summer
heat
and
winter
snow
come
after
autumn
vintage
say
to
yourself
the
seasons
pass
yet
they
will
come
again
but
i
am
going
never
again
to
return
as
often
as
you
behold
at
sunset
the
shadows
of
the
mountains
lengthening
on
the
plain
say
to
yourself
now
life
is
sinking
fast
the
shadow
of
death
begins
to
overspread
the
scene
yonder
sun
will
again
be
rising
the
same
but
this
day
of
mine
will
never
come
back
who
shall
count
the
glories
of
the
midnight
sky
which
though
it
be
the
time
that
men
of
evil
heart
choose
for
their
misdoing
yet
is
it
to
men
of
good
heart
the
holiest
of
all
times
well
take
care
you
be
not
less
watchful
than
that
admiral
of
the
trojan
fleet
for
the
seas
you
sail
upon
are
no
more
safe
than
his
rise
up
at
the
mid
hour
of
night
and
all
the
stars
that
in
the
silent
sky
roll
on
their
way
observe
with
careful
heed
as
you
see
them
hasten
to
their
setting
in
the
west
think
how
you
also
are
moving
with
them
and
that
as
for
your
abiding
you
have
no
hope
saving
only
in
him
who
knows
no
change
and
suffers
no
decline
moreover
when
you
meet
with
those
whom
you
knew
but
yesterday
as
children
and
see
them
now
growing
up
in
stature
to
their
manhood
stage
by
stage
remember
how
you
in
like
manner
in
the
same
lapse
of
time
are
going
down
the
hill
and
at
greater
speed
by
that
law
in
nature
under
which
things
that
are
heavy
tend
to
fall
when
your
eyes
behold
some
ancient
building
let
your
first
thought
be
where
are
those
who
wrought
it
with
their
hands
and
when
you
see
new
ones
ask
where
soon
the
builders
of
them
will
be
also
if
you
chance
to
see
the
trees
of
some
orchard
remember
how
often
it
falls
out
that
one
plants
it
and
another
plucks
the
fruit
for
many
a
time
the
saying
in
the
comes
to
pass
one
plants
the
tree
but
eh
the
shade
his
grandchild
will
enjoy
and
when
you
look
with
pleased
wonder
at
some
swiftly
flowing
stream
then
that
i
bring
no
other
poet
thought
keep
ever
in
mind
this
one
of
your
own
no
river
harries
with
more
rapid
flight
than
life
swift
current
neither
let
multitude
of
days
or
the
artificial
divisions
of
time
deceive
your
judgment
for
man
whole
existence
let
it
be
never
so
prolonged
is
but
as
one
day
and
that
not
a
day
entire
have
oftentimes
before
your
eyes
one
similitude
of
aristotle
whom
i
know
to
be
a
favourite
of
yours
and
his
words
i
am
sure
you
never
read
or
hear
without
feeling
them
deeply
you
will
find
it
reported
by
cicero
in
the
and
in
words
possibly
even
more
clear
and
impressive
than
the
original
here
is
what
he
says
or
very
nearly
so
for
at
the
moment
i
have
not
his
book
at
hand
aristotle
tells
us
that
on
the
banks
of
the
river
hypanis
which
on
one
side
of
europe
empties
itself
into
the
euxine
sea
there
exists
a
race
of
little
animals
who
only
live
one
day
any
one
of
them
that
dies
at
sunrise
dies
young
he
that
dies
at
noon
is
and
should
one
live
till
sunset
he
dies
in
old
age
and
especially
is
this
so
about
the
time
of
the
solstice
if
you
compare
the
time
of
man
life
with
eternity
it
will
seem
no
longer
than
theirs
so
far
i
give
you
cicero
but
what
he
says
seems
to
me
so
beyond
all
cavil
that
now
for
a
long
time
the
saying
has
passed
from
the
tongue
of
philosophers
into
common
speech
every
day
you
hear
even
ignorant
and
unlearned
men
if
they
chance
to
see
a
little
child
make
use
of
some
expression
like
this
well
well
it
early
morning
with
him
yet
if
they
see
a
man
they
will
say
oh
it
high
noon
with
him
now
or
he
well
in
the
middle
of
his
day
if
they
see
one
old
and
broken
down
they
will
remark
ah
he
getting
toward
evening
and
the
going
down
of
the
sun
ponder
well
on
these
things
my
very
dear
son
and
on
others
akin
to
them
which
will
i
doubt
not
flock
into
your
thoughts
as
these
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
have
come
into
mine
and
one
more
thing
i
beseech
you
to
have
in
mind
look
at
the
graves
of
those
older
perhaps
than
you
but
whom
nevertheless
you
have
known
look
diligently
and
then
rest
assured
that
the
same
the
same
house
is
for
you
also
made
ready
thither
are
all
of
us
travelling
on
that
is
our
last
home
you
who
now
perchance
are
proud
and
think
that
your
springtime
has
not
quite
departed
and
are
for
trampling
others
underfoot
you
in
turn
shall
underfoot
be
trampled
think
over
all
this
consider
it
by
day
and
by
night
not
merely
as
a
man
of
sober
mind
and
remembering
what
nature
he
is
of
but
as
becomes
a
man
of
wisdom
and
so
holding
it
all
fast
as
one
who
remembers
it
is
written
a
wise
man
life
is
all
one
preparation
for
death
this
saying
will
teach
you
to
think
little
of
what
concerns
earthly
things
and
set
before
your
eyes
a
better
path
of
life
on
which
to
enter
you
will
be
asking
me
what
is
that
kind
of
life
and
by
what
ways
you
can
approach
it
and
i
shall
reply
that
now
you
have
no
need
of
long
advice
or
counsel
listen
only
to
that
holy
spirit
who
is
ever
calling
and
in
urgent
words
saying
here
is
the
way
to
your
native
country
your
true
home
you
know
what
he
would
bring
to
mind
what
paths
for
your
feet
what
dangers
to
avoid
if
you
would
be
safe
and
free
obey
his
voice
there
is
no
need
for
long
deliberations
the
nature
of
your
danger
calls
for
action
not
words
the
enemy
is
pressing
you
from
behind
and
hastening
to
the
charge
in
front
the
walls
of
the
citadel
where
you
are
besieged
already
tremble
there
is
no
time
for
hesitation
of
what
use
is
it
to
make
sweet
songs
for
the
ears
of
others
if
you
listen
not
to
them
yourself
i
must
draw
to
an
end
shun
the
rocks
ahead
at
all
costs
drop
anchor
in
a
place
of
safety
follow
the
lead
which
the
inspirations
of
your
own
soul
give
you
they
may
on
the
side
of
what
is
evil
be
evil
but
towards
that
which
is
good
they
are
themselves
of
the
very
best
ah
would
that
you
had
told
me
all
this
before
i
had
surrendered
myself
over
to
these
studies
i
have
told
you
many
a
time
and
oft
from
the
moment
when
i
saw
you
first
take
up
your
pen
i
foresaw
how
short
life
would
be
and
how
uncertain
how
certain
too
and
how
long
the
toil
i
saw
the
work
would
be
great
and
the
fruit
little
and
i
warned
you
of
all
these
things
but
your
ears
were
filled
with
the
plaudits
of
the
public
which
to
my
astonishment
took
you
captive
although
you
talked
as
if
you
despised
them
but
as
we
have
now
been
conferring
together
long
enough
i
beg
that
if
any
of
my
counsels
have
seemed
good
to
you
you
will
not
allow
them
to
come
to
nothing
for
want
of
energy
or
recollection
and
if
on
the
other
hand
i
have
sometimes
been
too
rough
i
pray
you
take
it
not
amiss
indeed
i
owe
you
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
as
for
many
other
things
so
especially
for
this
three
days
colloquy
for
you
have
cleansed
my
darkened
sight
and
scattered
the
thick
clouds
of
error
in
which
i
was
involved
and
how
shall
i
express
my
thankfulness
to
her
also
the
spirit
of
truth
who
unwearied
by
our
much
talking
has
waited
upon
us
to
the
end
had
she
turned
away
her
face
from
us
we
should
have
wandered
in
darkness
your
discourse
had
then
contained
no
sure
truth
neither
would
my
understanding
have
embraced
it
and
now
as
she
and
you
have
your
in
heaven
and
i
must
still
abide
on
earth
and
as
you
see
am
greatly
perplexed
and
troubled
not
knowing
for
how
long
this
must
be
i
implore
you
of
your
goodness
not
to
forsake
me
in
spite
of
that
great
distance
which
separates
me
from
such
as
you
for
without
you
o
best
of
fathers
my
life
would
be
but
one
long
sadness
and
without
her
i
could
not
live
at
all
you
may
count
your
prayer
already
granted
if
you
will
only
to
yourself
be
true
for
how
shall
any
one
be
constant
to
him
who
is
inconstant
to
himself
i
will
be
true
to
myself
so
far
as
in
me
lies
i
will
pull
myself
together
and
collect
my
scattered
wits
and
make
a
great
endeavour
to
possess
my
soul
in
patience
but
even
while
we
speak
a
crowd
of
important
affairs
though
only
of
the
world
is
waiting
my
attention
for
the
common
herd
of
men
these
may
be
what
to
them
seem
more
important
but
in
reality
there
is
nothing
of
more
importance
and
nothing
ought
to
be
esteemed
of
so
much
worth
for
of
other
trains
of
thought
you
may
reckon
them
to
be
not
essential
for
the
soul
but
the
end
of
life
will
prove
that
these
we
have
been
engaged
in
are
of
eternal
necessity
i
confess
they
are
so
and
i
now
return
to
attend
to
those
other
concerns
only
in
order
that
when
they
are
discharged
i
may
come
back
to
these
i
am
not
ignorant
that
as
you
said
a
few
minutes
before
it
would
be
much
safer
for
me
to
attend
only
to
the
care
of
my
soul
to
relinquish
altogether
every
bypath
and
follow
the
straight
path
of
the
way
of
salvation
but
i
have
not
strength
to
resist
that
old
bent
for
study
altogether
we
are
falling
into
our
old
controversy
want
of
will
you
call
want
of
power
well
so
it
must
be
if
it
can
not
be
otherwise
i
pray
god
that
he
will
go
with
you
where
you
go
and
that
he
will
order
your
steps
even
though
they
wander
into
the
way
of
truth
o
may
it
indeed
be
as
you
have
prayed
may
god
lead
me
safe
and
whole
out
of
so
many
crooked
ways
that
i
may
follow
the
voice
that
calls
me
that
i
may
raise
up
no
cloud
of
dust
before
my
eyes
and
with
my
mind
calmed
down
and
at
peace
i
may
hear
the
world
grow
still
and
silent
and
the
winds
of
adversity
die
away
